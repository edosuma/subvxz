WEBVTT

01:45.647 --> 01:48.107
...the wall Blackhaven

01:48.191 --> 01:51.194
are unscalable vassalstone.

01:52.654 --> 01:58.284
And the castle is surrounded
by a deep, dry moat.

01:58.368 --> 02:02.914
It is well fortified against
any future Dornish incursions.

02:04.374 --> 02:08.253
And though my seat may be lesser in size,

02:08.336 --> 02:12.257
it is situated most pleasingly.

02:36.447 --> 02:40.827
The view across the Marches is inspiring,

02:40.910 --> 02:44.789
so said Queen Alysanne herself
when she honored my father and I--

02:44.873 --> 02:47.167
And tell me, Lord Dondarrion,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.794
did you think my great-grandmother
as beautiful as they say?

02:51.254 --> 02:56.009
This was half a century ago, Princess.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.969
Yes, it was.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.557
That was unseemly, Princess.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.435
The man is older than my father.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.854
It's unseemly for him
to put himself forward

03:07.937 --> 03:09.856
as a contender for my hand.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.567
Next!

03:23.786 --> 03:25.330
And now a child.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.292
The Blackwoods are an ancient house
with a formidable army.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.631
In the Riverlands,
they once ruled as kings.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.134
The blood of the First Men
still flows in their veins.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.220
Go on.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.350
My Princess...

03:45.433 --> 03:47.310
ours is a bond that has long endured,

03:47.393 --> 03:50.021
since Lucas Blackwood,
the grandsire of my grandsire,

03:50.104 --> 03:51.940
aided the Dragon in his war of conquest--

03:52.023 --> 03:55.902
Aye, the Blackwoods
truly turned the tide on that one.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.323
Coursed with the blood of the First Men,

04:00.406 --> 04:03.493
our history is deeply rooted in this land,

04:03.576 --> 04:06.537
which your house has made its home.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.164
If chosen as your match, Princess...

04:08.790 --> 04:10.583
your days shall be easy

04:10.667 --> 04:13.920
and nights safe under my protection.

04:14.003 --> 04:17.507
"Protection"? The Princess has a dragon,
you dumb cunt.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.052
Bracken!

04:21.135 --> 04:22.679
I could learn to like that one.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.140
Let us have the next

04:26.224 --> 04:28.434
so we may go to supper.

04:29.769 --> 04:30.770
Craven.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.024
We're leaving.

04:37.568 --> 04:40.113
Sheathe that steel, you twats!

04:40.196 --> 04:42.991
Send word to the harbor
and have Captain Oswin ready the ship.

04:43.074 --> 04:44.701
Princess, we're due in Bitterbridge
in three days' time.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.619
I would happily row myself back
to King's Landing

04:46.703 --> 04:48.788
if it brought an end
to this ridiculous pageant.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.878
Don't look, Princess.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.319
We should make landfall
inside the hour, Princess.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.158
How do you think he will take it?

05:25.241 --> 05:27.410
Do you speak of how you
rejected every suitor

05:27.493 --> 05:29.579
His Grace put before you,
or how you abruptly ended the tour

05:29.662 --> 05:30.830
with two months remaining?

05:47.263 --> 05:49.098
Take cover!

05:53.770 --> 05:54.687
Princess!

05:55.938 --> 05:58.524
You all right? Are you?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.526
-Fetch the maester!
-I'm fine.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.038
It's Daemon.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.189
Add it to the chair.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.955
You wear a crown.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.833
Do you also call yourself "King"?

08:21.834 --> 08:23.544
Once we smashed the Triarchy,

08:23.628 --> 08:26.380
they named me "King of the Narrow Sea."

08:30.927 --> 08:34.514
But I know that there
is only one true king, Your Grace.

08:37.934 --> 08:41.520
♪ ♪

08:42.980 --> 08:47.026
My crown and the Stepstones... are yours.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.199
Where is Lord Corlys?

08:53.282 --> 08:55.368
He sailed home to Driftmark.

08:55.451 --> 08:58.663
-Who holds the Stepstones?
-The tides...

08:58.746 --> 09:04.210
the crabs, and 2,000
dead Triarchy corsairs,

09:04.293 --> 09:07.463
staked to the sand to warn
those who might follow.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.002
Rise.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.695
The realm owes you a great debt, brother.

10:15.990 --> 10:16.907
Come.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.540
This is our chance...

10:24.623 --> 10:27.960
Daemon, he would venture off, abroad,

10:28.044 --> 10:29.962
winning tournaments...

10:31.922 --> 10:33.299
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.551
I will not revisit this debate.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.803
You were always mother's favorite.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.056
No, it's no great mystery.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.265
You were.

10:42.767 --> 10:47.146
Our mother, she had no regard
for custom or tradition, rules.

10:47.229 --> 10:50.566
And I, sadly, was no great warrior.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.611
Congratulations on your victory.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.409
Thank you, Princess.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.626
Perhaps Prince Daemon
would care for a tour of the gallery?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.461
He hasn't yet seen the new tapestries

11:10.544 --> 11:13.506
gifted to you by Norvos and Qohor.

11:13.589 --> 11:17.343
Would you like to see the tapestries?

11:20.805 --> 11:23.349
He has no interest in such things.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.893
I'd like to see them.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.106
Then you should not deprive yourself.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.984
I shall enjoy them alone.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.948
More wine.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.413
As I said, you were the favorite.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.666
No, you were. You were. I insist.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.016
I surmise the tour did not go well.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.561
I endured it for as long as I could.

12:10.020 --> 12:14.692
To have every young knight and lord
in the Seven Kingdoms fawning over you...

12:14.775 --> 12:15.609
What misery.

12:19.655 --> 12:23.409
It is rare for girls in this realm to get
a choice between two suitors,

12:23.492 --> 12:25.411
no less two score of them.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.540
Those men and boys don't fawn over me.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.293
They only want my name
and my Valyrian blood for their offspring.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.173
I think it's rather romantic.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.219
How romantic it must be
to get imprisoned in a castle

12:42.303 --> 12:44.847
and made to squeeze out heirs.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.853
Sorry.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.490
How angry is he?

13:05.701 --> 13:08.537
The King went through
great effort to arrange your tour.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.290
He is... frustrated.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.376
But I am glad you are home.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.550
I find I have few friends lately.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.846
I like to believe I'm still
the Lady Alicent, but...

13:28.140 --> 13:31.977
all anyone sees when
they look at me now is "The Queen."

13:34.230 --> 13:36.148
I've missed you, too.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.184
So...

14:13.727 --> 14:14.937
what do you want?

14:16.313 --> 14:18.482
Only the comforts of home.

14:25.489 --> 14:29.410
I had not thought you
particularly comfortable in this home.

14:32.454 --> 14:36.000
Though I do suppose you seem changed
by your adventures.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.795
More mature, perhaps.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.216
You've matured yourself
these last four years, Princess.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.846
You'll get used to the attention.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.431
The attention I can endure.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.224
It's the rest I could do without.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.268
My father seems content to sell me off

14:54.351 --> 14:56.895
to whichever lord has the biggest castle.

14:57.938 --> 15:00.274
There are worse things to be sold for.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.813
Such a lonely prospect.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.025
The Stepstones were meant
to be won for the realm,

16:25.109 --> 16:27.319
but over the past few days,
it seems we have traded

16:27.403 --> 16:29.780
a crabfeeder for a seasnake.

16:29.863 --> 16:34.451
This is clearly a rebuke for passing over
Lady Laena for Queen Alicent.

16:34.535 --> 16:37.413
Years have passed since the business
with his daughter.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.540
Certainly, he cannot still be wroth?

16:39.623 --> 16:43.669
The Sea Snake is an over-proud man,
to be sure, Your Grace.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.754
That pride has been injured.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.632
Perhaps we can salve the wound?

16:48.716 --> 16:51.844
I fear Lord Corlys's pride
is the least of our worries.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.804
I don't wish to cause
you further distress,

16:53.887 --> 16:57.307
Your Grace, but my brother
has sent disturbing word from Oldtown.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.311
Lord Corlys is said to have
engaged in negotiations

17:01.395 --> 17:03.063
with the Sealord of Braavos.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.900
He plans to wed his daughter Laena
to the Sealord's son.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.239
If House Velaryon entered into an alliance

17:12.322 --> 17:15.367
with the Free Cities

17:15.451 --> 17:16.577
then...

17:17.369 --> 17:21.290
we would have to seek
our own marriage pact.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.342
-Good night, Ser Criston.
-Sleep well, Princess.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.400
Where are we going?

21:00.342 --> 21:02.260
Fuck off, boy.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.514
He called me boy.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.911
Do you wish to know your death, child?

21:45.971 --> 21:47.514
Let me take that.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.322
Leave us, all of you.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.178
You have a far kinder touch than they do.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.596
Thank you, husband.

22:30.682 --> 22:36.021
And now we come to the matter
of the great Iron Chair...

22:36.938 --> 22:40.150
and whose bum it might bear.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.152
Our good King...

22:42.235 --> 22:44.613
names his daughter,

22:44.696 --> 22:46.823
a girl, his heir.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.623
But then to him, a babe is born.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.884
A son!

23:05.967 --> 23:10.013
To which heir might the chair bear?

23:10.430 --> 23:11.681
Who will it be?

23:11.765 --> 23:14.059
The brother? The daughter?

23:14.142 --> 23:16.436
Or the little princeling of three?

23:28.198 --> 23:32.369
Rhaenyra... the Realm's Delight,

23:32.452 --> 23:35.330
a girl so young and so slight...

23:36.331 --> 23:39.501
loved by all of her people,

23:39.584 --> 23:43.380
but would she make a powerful queen,

23:43.463 --> 23:46.174
-or would she be feeble?
-Feeble!

23:46.258 --> 23:49.845
Though Aegon, the babe Prince,
might long for a claim,

23:49.928 --> 23:53.098
he has two things Rhaenyra cannot:

23:53.181 --> 23:55.142
a conqueror's name...

23:55.934 --> 23:57.060
and a cock.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.358
Lies, slander! Boo!

24:03.442 --> 24:05.110
Jest if you will,

24:05.193 --> 24:07.112
but many of the smallfolk
are like to believe

24:07.195 --> 24:10.031
that, as a male, Aegon should be the heir.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.577
Their wants are of no consequence.

24:16.663 --> 24:20.041
They're of great consequence
if you expect to rule them one day.

24:21.751 --> 24:25.255
For one night, I wish to be free
of the burdens of my inheritance.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.013
Four coppers, street rat.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.223
In King's Landing,
we pay for our pleasures.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.101
-Hey!
-Stop! Boy!

24:38.185 --> 24:39.394
Wait, I'll find him.

25:18.016 --> 25:21.186
And who might you be running from, now?

25:21.269 --> 25:22.395
Ser Harwin.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.272
Princess.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.320
Don't.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.948
You take care, boy.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.408
Next time, you might not be so lucky.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.248
Enjoyed that, did you?

25:43.166 --> 25:46.711
Who knows when I'll next taste freedom?

25:58.932 --> 26:00.850
Come.

26:05.605 --> 26:06.773
Pardon me, Your Grace.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.609
The King has requested your presence.

26:15.490 --> 26:16.616
The hour is quite late.

26:17.158 --> 26:18.702
Yes, Your Grace.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.413
What is this place?

28:27.497 --> 28:30.041
It's where people come
to take what they want.

28:52.188 --> 28:54.732
Fucking is a pleasure, you see.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.736
For the woman as it is the man.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.503
A marriage is a duty... Yes.

29:19.924 --> 29:22.844
But that doesn't stop us
from doing what we want.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.725
From fucking who we want.

30:49.806 --> 30:50.932
Daemon?

31:30.221 --> 31:31.389
Princess?

31:39.939 --> 31:41.858
Princess, are you, are you hurt?

31:44.861 --> 31:47.989
-I should alert the Lord Commander.
-No.

31:53.578 --> 31:56.122
My helmet.

32:03.755 --> 32:04.964
You finished?

32:08.217 --> 32:09.510
Thank you.

32:40.750 --> 32:41.876
Stop.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.160
Apologies for the late hour, my Lord.

36:44.243 --> 36:45.328
What is it?

36:45.411 --> 36:47.914
A messenger brings word
from the White Worm.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.775
Am I your prisoner?

37:15.858 --> 37:18.027
As I was once yours?

37:22.907 --> 37:25.826
I'm your protector, lucky for you.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.002
This will cut the fog.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.508
I don't need protection
from a common whore.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.051
I am not so common.

37:44.011 --> 37:46.389
A not-so-common whore then.

37:46.472 --> 37:49.016
I've left that life behind.

37:49.100 --> 37:53.229
I learned that skin-trade
could only take me so far in this life.

37:54.230 --> 37:56.357
You never were one to stay idle.

37:57.358 --> 38:00.611
Hard lessons are not
welcomed but suffered.

38:16.752 --> 38:19.297
You can pay for the room on your way out.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.407
Come.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.168
What is it?

38:58.878 --> 39:01.547
I apologize for the early hour,
Your Grace.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.716
I have...

39:05.051 --> 39:06.260
discomforting news.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.638
I thought it best shared discreetly
before the council convenes.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.640
The Sea Snake.

39:14.810 --> 39:17.730
I'm afraid it concerns
the Princess, my King.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.983
Has she been harmed?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.573
It is no easy thing

39:27.656 --> 39:30.576
to tell a father of
his daughter's exploits.

39:31.827 --> 39:33.871
I had considered saying nothing, but--

39:33.954 --> 39:35.623
What has she done?

39:39.043 --> 39:41.587
The Princess was spied last evening...

39:43.005 --> 39:45.549
beyond the walls of the Keep...

39:47.259 --> 39:48.677
in a pleasure house.

39:49.428 --> 39:50.554
What of it?

39:51.305 --> 39:54.225
She was carrying on with her uncle.

39:55.851 --> 40:00.439
They were engaged in behaviors
unbecoming of a maiden...

40:02.108 --> 40:03.776
of a Princess.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.489
What behaviors?

40:14.703 --> 40:16.664
Well, must I say it, Your Grace?

40:16.747 --> 40:20.084
You enter my bedchamber,
accusing my daughter of something.

40:20.167 --> 40:22.545
Now speak it... plainly.

40:26.507 --> 40:29.051
Daemon and Rhaenyra were seen together...

40:30.845 --> 40:32.847
in the bowels of a pleasure den.

40:44.233 --> 40:45.401
Coupling.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.119
This is a lie.

40:56.203 --> 40:57.746
You have been lied to.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.958
I only wish that were true, Your Grace.

41:03.043 --> 41:05.171
Who is responsible for this gossip?

41:06.213 --> 41:08.674
Have this rumormonger
brought before me at once.

41:08.757 --> 41:10.759
And I will take their eyes.

41:10.843 --> 41:14.430
As your Hand, I must maintain trusted
sources of information.

41:14.513 --> 41:17.183
And this one, as yet,
has never led me astray.

41:17.975 --> 41:21.312
And several of the servants
have now admitted to seeing her,

41:21.395 --> 41:22.938
the Princess...

41:23.522 --> 41:25.691
creeping through the gates
from King's Landing,

41:25.774 --> 41:27.651
disguised as a page

41:27.735 --> 41:29.862
during the hour of the owl.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.490
Are you so sick with ambition

41:33.574 --> 41:35.492
that you would have my daughter stalked?

41:36.076 --> 41:37.620
Spied upon?

41:38.287 --> 41:41.373
Awaiting your best chance
to destroy her reputation?

41:42.333 --> 41:45.127
I have no such intent, Your Grace.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.129
You think yourself a cunning man.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.757
Your designs are obvious.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.844
Do you wish to have your blood
on the Iron Throne so badly

41:53.928 --> 41:56.263
that you are willing to destroy mine own?

41:58.766 --> 41:59.892
Just get out.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.565
Leave me... at once.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.405
Your Grace.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.073
I'm dressed, Annora. Come.

43:05.958 --> 43:07.084
Princess.

43:12.923 --> 43:13.966
Come.

43:23.767 --> 43:26.395
Princess, I have
a message from the Queen.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.629
What happened last night?

43:54.506 --> 43:56.467
What do you mean?

43:56.550 --> 43:59.178
My father has made
some worrying allegations about you.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.724
Were you with your uncle?

44:05.934 --> 44:07.936
Oh, I...

44:08.020 --> 44:09.730
I haven't seen him in years.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.273
He took me into the city for some fun.

44:11.357 --> 44:13.609
Tell me the whole of it, Rhaenyra.

44:13.692 --> 44:15.611
Your father accused me of something.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.739
That I drank wine?

44:18.822 --> 44:21.241
Left the castle after dark?

44:21.325 --> 44:23.202
That you fucked Daemon
in a pleasure house.

44:32.002 --> 44:36.256
This is a vile accusation.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.383
Is it?

44:37.466 --> 44:40.386
You Targaryens do have queer customs.

44:40.469 --> 44:43.639
-And Daemon certainly knows no limit.
-Alicent...

44:43.722 --> 44:46.308
Your Grace, sister, you must know I would,

44:46.392 --> 44:47.726
I would never.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.269
You cannot believe such gossip.

44:49.353 --> 44:50.562
My father is no gossip.

44:50.646 --> 44:51.814
Well, certainly he's been misled.

44:51.897 --> 44:53.190
He could not have witnessed such a thing.

44:53.273 --> 44:54.942
-Why not?
-Because it did not happen.

44:55.025 --> 44:56.944
-He was told that you--
-Told?

44:59.488 --> 45:01.407
Who made these claims to your father?

45:05.369 --> 45:07.287
I am the Princess.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.999
To question my virtue
is an act of treason.

45:13.419 --> 45:16.088
-I do not know specifically--
-Your father did not tell you?

45:16.839 --> 45:18.757
He reported it to the King.

45:21.635 --> 45:22.761
I overheard.

45:26.849 --> 45:29.393
So you are accusing me of slanders...

45:30.269 --> 45:31.812
you overheard?

45:32.688 --> 45:34.731
I only want to help you, Rhaenyra.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.242
We drank in a tavern.

45:46.910 --> 45:49.455
Several... taverns.

45:50.622 --> 45:52.416
It was getting late...

45:53.167 --> 45:54.710
and I asked to go home.

45:55.794 --> 45:57.713
But Daemon wished to continue.

46:00.507 --> 46:02.968
As he was my escort, I had no real choice.

46:03.051 --> 46:04.261
"Continue"...

46:07.055 --> 46:08.182
in a brothel?

46:09.016 --> 46:11.268
He took me to a show.

46:13.145 --> 46:16.064
I was only a spectator.
I didn't do anything.

46:21.695 --> 46:24.573
And then Daemon sank into his cups and

46:26.200 --> 46:29.745
abandoned me for some whore.

46:34.333 --> 46:36.251
I should've known better.

46:42.424 --> 46:43.759
So you did not?

46:46.887 --> 46:49.431
Must I truly refute that?

46:53.393 --> 46:55.854
Daemon never touched me.

46:57.606 --> 47:01.693
I swear this to you
upon the memory of my mother.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.241
It was foolish of you to place
yourself in a position

47:07.324 --> 47:09.493
where your virtue could
even come into question.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.499
The King has strived
to find you a good match.

47:15.582 --> 47:16.917
And so have I.

47:17.876 --> 47:20.003
If that lord were to think
that you had been...

47:21.880 --> 47:23.006
sullied...

47:24.758 --> 47:27.094
-it would ruin everything.
-I know...

47:27.970 --> 47:28.971
Your Grace.

47:30.973 --> 47:32.057
I regret it.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.908
The King demands an audience, my Prince.

47:49.992 --> 47:52.578
Take your fucking hands off me.

48:40.500 --> 48:41.543
My daughter.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.762
Won't you even deny it?

48:51.845 --> 48:55.641
I need to understand the charge
before I can attempt to discredit it.

48:57.017 --> 48:58.268
You defiled her.

49:07.110 --> 49:08.612
Still, you say nothing.

49:08.695 --> 49:10.989
What does it matter, brother?

49:11.073 --> 49:12.324
When we were Rhaenyra's age,

49:12.407 --> 49:14.284
we fucked our way through
most of the brothels

49:14.368 --> 49:15.827
on the Street of Silk.

49:15.911 --> 49:17.454
We were young men.

49:17.954 --> 49:19.873
She is just a girl.

49:19.956 --> 49:22.167
-Your niece!
-Rhaenyra's a woman-grown.

49:22.250 --> 49:24.670
Better her first experience
be with me than some whore.

49:24.753 --> 49:25.712
You fucking--

49:27.464 --> 49:29.716
You have ruined her!

49:29.800 --> 49:31.968
What lord will wed her now?
In this condition?

49:32.052 --> 49:34.596
Who gives a fuck what some lord thinks?

49:34.680 --> 49:38.767
You are the dragon.
Your word is truth and law.

49:38.850 --> 49:41.311
I have spent a lifetime defending you.

49:41.937 --> 49:44.398
But your heart is even
blacker than I thought.

49:44.481 --> 49:48.985
I should disinherit her
as I already did you and be done with it.

49:49.986 --> 49:51.530
Wed her to me.

49:53.115 --> 49:56.326
When I offered up my crown,
you said I could have anything.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.704
I want Rhaenyra.
I'll take her as she is,

49:58.787 --> 50:00.747
and wed her in the tradition of our house.

50:00.831 --> 50:03.125
You are already wed.

50:03.208 --> 50:05.836
That didn't stop Aegon the Conqueror
from taking a second wife.

50:06.628 --> 50:08.255
You are no conqueror.

50:08.338 --> 50:11.800
You are a plague... sent to destroy me.

50:11.883 --> 50:14.803
Give me Rhaenyra to take to wife

50:14.886 --> 50:18.640
and we will return the House of the Dragon
to its proper glory.

50:18.724 --> 50:19.975
Of course.

50:20.058 --> 50:22.602
It's not my daughter you lust for, is it?

50:23.603 --> 50:24.771
It's my throne.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.943
Go back to the Vale, Daemon,

50:30.026 --> 50:31.945
to your lawful wife.

50:32.946 --> 50:37.909
Strive to restore whatever
scrap of honor remains in you.

50:37.993 --> 50:40.829
Or don't. Matters not to me.

50:41.538 --> 50:43.790
As long as you are gone
from my sight for good.

50:51.339 --> 50:53.258
As you wish, brother.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.165
Have you spoken to her?

51:27.834 --> 51:28.835
No.

51:34.174 --> 51:36.718
It is not in Rhaenyra's
nature to be deceitful.

51:38.053 --> 51:39.971
I cannot say the same for your brother.

51:40.972 --> 51:42.307
You believe he lied?

51:43.558 --> 51:45.685
How often does he speak the pure truth?

51:47.103 --> 51:50.023
How does confessing
to such things serve him?

51:52.984 --> 51:54.736
By reducing you.

52:00.992 --> 52:04.538
Whatever transpired,
Rhaenyra is not innocent.

52:05.413 --> 52:07.833
Only because Daemon tried to corrupt her.

52:07.916 --> 52:11.169
Daemon and Rhaenyra
share the blood of the dragon.

52:11.253 --> 52:13.046
They are restless and chaotic.

52:13.129 --> 52:15.882
She swore to me that she remains a maiden.

52:17.592 --> 52:19.135
And I believe her.

53:23.408 --> 53:26.995
That dagger once belonged
to Aegon the Conqueror.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.540
It was Aenar's before that.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.001
And before that...

53:33.919 --> 53:35.837
t is difficult to know.

53:41.593 --> 53:45.555
Before Aegon's death,
the last of the Valyrian pyromancers

53:45.639 --> 53:47.182
hid his song in the steel.

53:54.856 --> 53:56.858
"From my blood...

53:57.609 --> 54:00.820
"come the Prince That Was Promised...

54:02.948 --> 54:06.493
and his will be the Song of Ice and Fire."

54:10.956 --> 54:14.417
The responsibility I have handed to you,

54:14.501 --> 54:16.628
the burden of this knowledge...

54:17.879 --> 54:21.383
it is larger than the throne, the king.

54:21.466 --> 54:23.009
It is larger than you

54:23.093 --> 54:25.178
and your desires.

54:29.808 --> 54:32.268
Jaehaerys would've disinherited you.

54:32.352 --> 54:33.478
For a lie?

54:34.938 --> 54:37.607
You've yet to ask me for the truth
of what happened.

54:37.691 --> 54:40.193
The truth does not matter, Rhaenyra.

54:40.276 --> 54:42.153
Only perception.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.989
You have exposed yourself.

54:44.072 --> 54:46.074
Now we must both suffer the consequences.

54:46.658 --> 54:49.869
Were I born a man,
I could bed whomever I wanted.

54:50.620 --> 54:52.288
I could father a dozen bastards,

54:52.372 --> 54:55.083
and no one in your court
would blink an eye.

54:55.166 --> 54:58.378
You are right...
but you were born a woman.

54:59.421 --> 55:02.132
So you'll strip me of my titles
and name Aegon in my stead.

55:02.215 --> 55:03.341
I would.

55:04.426 --> 55:08.555
But it is mine to hold the realm together,
not sow it with further division.

55:10.432 --> 55:13.059
Your courtship is at an end.

55:13.143 --> 55:15.353
You will wed Ser Laenor Velaryon,

55:15.437 --> 55:17.731
and you will do so without protest.

55:18.898 --> 55:20.859
The son of the Sea Snake.

55:20.942 --> 55:23.445
So I can be a remedy
for your political headaches.

55:23.528 --> 55:26.322
You are my political headache!

55:30.618 --> 55:32.871
Your wedding to Ser Laenor Velaryon

55:32.954 --> 55:35.790
will unite the two most powerful houses
in the realm.

55:35.874 --> 55:39.878
With the combined strength
of our shared dragons and naval fleets,

55:39.961 --> 55:42.630
no one would dare to stand against us.

55:42.714 --> 55:44.049
The House of the Dragon

55:44.132 --> 55:46.593
will stand as one
for a further generation.

55:46.676 --> 55:50.472
And what will you do about the vulture
who perches upon your throne?

55:51.014 --> 55:52.348
What vulture?

55:52.974 --> 55:54.184
Your Hand.

55:55.894 --> 55:59.981
Otto Hightower has served two kings
loyally and faithfully.

56:01.274 --> 56:03.193
He wants Aegon to be named heir.

56:03.902 --> 56:06.488
And he will stop
at nothing to see it done.

56:06.571 --> 56:09.532
Including spying on me
to bring about my ruin.

56:10.992 --> 56:13.578
You speak of The Conqueror's vision

56:13.661 --> 56:16.915
and the need for strength
and unity across the realm.

56:16.998 --> 56:18.625
But how can that be accomplished

56:18.708 --> 56:21.252
with your most trusted adviser
so self-interested?

56:21.336 --> 56:23.797
Every lord and lady that calls
for an audience with me,

56:23.880 --> 56:25.715
every man on my small council,

56:25.799 --> 56:28.760
and all councils past,
has been self-interested.

56:28.843 --> 56:31.304
-It is unavoidable.
-I disagree.

56:31.387 --> 56:35.558
I will do my duty as heir
and wed Ser Laenor.

56:37.894 --> 56:40.605
But you must first do yours as king.

56:51.157 --> 56:53.076
Your Grace.

56:55.870 --> 56:56.996
Five days.

57:00.416 --> 57:02.377
I'm sorry, Your Grace?

57:02.460 --> 57:04.796
Though it was some time ago.

57:04.879 --> 57:07.757
The details... they fade in memory.

57:08.925 --> 57:12.303
My father was a hale and healthy warrior
and dragonrider

57:12.387 --> 57:14.305
at the peak of his abilities.

57:15.098 --> 57:16.808
Jaehaerys named a great royal hunt

57:16.891 --> 57:19.060
to celebrate him being
named the Hand of the King.

57:21.271 --> 57:24.816
Five days later my father lay dead.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.111
Tourneys last longer.

57:29.904 --> 57:32.198
Baelon the Brave,

57:32.282 --> 57:34.367
rider of Vhagar,

57:34.450 --> 57:36.369
heir to the Iron Throne...

57:37.871 --> 57:39.789
dead of a burst belly.

57:41.749 --> 57:43.168
The gods have a dark wit.

57:44.377 --> 57:46.296
It was a grim day.

57:47.589 --> 57:50.133
-I recall it all too well.
-Yeah...

57:51.217 --> 57:53.136
It was a good day for you.

57:54.554 --> 57:57.098
Jaehaerys named you Hand
in Baelon's stead.

58:00.518 --> 58:03.438
That's hardly how I viewed it, Your Grace.

58:04.355 --> 58:05.899
It was a duty.

58:08.735 --> 58:12.488
You served my grandsire
nobly in his final days.

58:13.907 --> 58:16.117
You are the man that
taught me how to be King.

58:18.119 --> 58:21.664
You honor me, Your Grace.

58:22.290 --> 58:23.833
Just five days...

58:25.627 --> 58:28.922
you went from being another man
in Jaehaerys's court,

58:29.005 --> 58:31.007
to the second most
powerful man in the realm.

58:32.342 --> 58:33.468
I wonder...

58:34.969 --> 58:37.722
how long did it take you
to choose yourself over your King?

58:40.808 --> 58:41.935
Your Grace?

58:43.228 --> 58:45.772
I will never recover from Aemma's death.

58:46.773 --> 58:47.899
But Alicent...

58:48.983 --> 58:50.944
she took me through the worst of my grief.

58:53.488 --> 58:56.032
She was a calculated distraction.

58:57.367 --> 59:00.495
I only now realize
how well-calculated it was.

59:00.578 --> 59:02.997
That is an absurdity.

59:03.623 --> 59:05.541
The Queen loves you...

59:06.834 --> 59:08.836
as I know you love her.

59:08.920 --> 59:12.298
Your interests no longer align
with those of the realm.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.759
Your judgment has been compromised.

59:14.842 --> 59:17.345
A loyal Hand must tell his king

59:17.428 --> 59:20.556
a discomforting truth
from time to time, Your Grace.

59:20.640 --> 59:22.183
If he doesn't...

59:23.643 --> 59:25.603
he's failed as a servant.

59:26.688 --> 59:29.023
You were a faithful servant, Otto.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.576
The crown and the realm

59:40.660 --> 59:43.579
both owe you a debt
that can never be repaid.

59:44.831 --> 59:47.333
But I can no longer trust your judgment.

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:12.900
Come.

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:20.700
I hope you can forgive
the late hour, Princess.

1:00:25.663 --> 1:00:28.583
I took great care in its preparation.

1:00:31.336 --> 1:00:34.213
If not brewed properly,
it can either prove ineffective

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:38.301
-or else bear unpleasant--
-Brewed properly?

1:00:40.219 --> 1:00:41.763
I'm sorry, what is that?

1:00:42.555 --> 1:00:44.474
A tea, Princess.

1:00:45.266 --> 1:00:46.768
From the King.

1:00:47.894 --> 1:00:53.024
It will rid you of any
unwanted consequences.
