00:46.422 --> 00:47.923
-Aah!
-Dad, Dad, it's me.

It's me, it's me, it's me, it's me.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.340
I'm on your side.

I'm on your side.

Oh, my God.

00:57.016 --> 00:58.222
Oh, my God, what happened?

00:58.684 --> 00:59.309
Where is she?

00:59.519 --> 01:00.349
Oh, my God.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.346
Where is she, Cady?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.018
I got to stop the bleeding, okay?

01:03.231 --> 01:05.347
Shh, shh, don't speak.
Just stay right there.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.555
Don't move, don't move.

01:14.450 --> 01:15.235
I'm right here.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.361
[Walt] Where is she?

01:16.994 --> 01:17.983
Where is she, Cady?

01:19.330 --> 01:20.445
Dad, I'm right here.

-Stay with me.

-Cady.
-Yeah.

01:26.629 --> 01:28.210
-Yeah.
-Where is she?

01:29.799 --> 01:30.629
Where is she?

01:31.801 --> 01:32.631
She's dead, Dad.

01:33.803 --> 01:34.633
Mom's dead.

01:35.388 --> 01:36.218
She's gone.

01:37.557 --> 01:38.387
But I'm right here.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.588
-Cady.
-|'m right here.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.799
I'm right here,
and you're gonna be fine.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.351
Okay?
Stay here.

01:45.523 --> 01:46.353
Stay with me.

01:49.569 --> 01:50.274
Dad.

01:51.904 --> 01:52.689
Dad.

01:53.573 --> 01:54.779
Dad!

01:54.991 --> 01:56.902
[echoing] Dad!
Please wake up!

01:59.078 --> 02:00.033
Please, Dad!

02:01.122 --> 02:02.578
Don't leave me!

02:03.541 --> 02:05.202
Please don't leave me, Dad!

02:07.378 --> 02:09.118
Please don't leave me, too.

02:36.616 --> 02:37.605
Sit down, Standing Bear.

02:38.284 --> 02:39.194
I would rather stand.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.781
Yeah, I would, too,
if I had a bullet in my ass.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.998
.30-caliber bullet
from Walt Longmire's rifle.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.576
He fired at the man he thought was Hector.

02:51.839 --> 02:55.423
Bullet hit this rock and ricocheted
into your butt as you ran away.

02:58.471 --> 02:59.802
Your blood under these leaves.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.259
Same blood I found soaking
the seat of your truck.

03:03.476 --> 03:04.386
Which was stolen.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.062
No, it just wasn't
where you had stashed it

03:07.271 --> 03:09.683
after it broke down,
'cause I found it.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.068
I fixed your punctured fuel line,
by the way.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.184
If you were so certain
you had me dead to rights,

03:15.404 --> 03:16.860
why am I not in jail?

03:17.073 --> 03:18.779
Oh, jail's still on the table...

03:19.867 --> 03:21.823
for the assault and murder
of Tyler Malone.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.910
But I'm gonna give you another choice.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.619
You can work for me.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.078
Well, not so much you as Hector.

03:30.878 --> 03:31.663
Doing what?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.419
Whatever I ask.

03:34.507 --> 03:35.917
[cellphone ringing]

03:37.218 --> 03:38.048
Don't answer.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.967
She will wonder why I am not picking up.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.218
And you'll lie to her.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.102
You've gotten pretty good at that.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.687
I believe you are overplaying your hand.

03:53.526 --> 03:54.356
Is that so?

03:55.611 --> 03:56.600
Even if I did what you say,

03:56.904 --> 03:58.815
you have no authority
to prosecute felonies,

03:59.031 --> 04:01.238
and the feds have never been interested
in helping you.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.034
True.

04:04.370 --> 04:06.076
But I'm gonna have something this time...

04:07.289 --> 04:08.449
I've never had before.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.413
Evidence.

04:12.002 --> 04:13.538
Now let's roll up that sleeve, hmm?

04:30.396 --> 04:32.387
[panting]

04:36.152 --> 04:36.857
Where is he?

04:37.403 --> 04:39.018
Lady, I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.532
[monitor beeping]

05:06.098 --> 05:07.133
[sighs]

05:41.842 --> 05:44.174
| just had to do that once before you die.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.595
I'm not dying.

05:53.103 --> 05:53.762
I know.

05:56.232 --> 05:56.846
[footsteps approaching]

05:57.066 --> 05:57.896
[clears throat]

05:58.442 --> 06:00.023
-Hey.
-Oh.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.105
Thank God.
You're awake.

06:02.321 --> 06:06.280
He's, uh... a little stunned
from the surgery still.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.698
Hey.

06:08.994 --> 06:09.949
You feeling okay?

06:12.164 --> 06:12.994
Yeah.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.997
Okay enough to answer some questions?

06:19.880 --> 06:20.869
Uh-huh.

06:22.675 --> 06:23.881
What the hell happened?

06:25.886 --> 06:26.875
I got, uh --

06:27.096 --> 06:29.257
And if you say you got shot,
lam gonna punch you.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.222
Beyond that, I... don't know.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.105
The bullet went through and through, Dad.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.282
But it only hit soft tissue,
so there's minimal damage.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.278
They say you took
a pretty hard blow to the head.

06:50.786 --> 06:51.616
Five stitches.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.244
[Vic]
Who was it, Walt?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.159
I don't know.

07:01.881 --> 07:04.543
Did you not hear them come in?
Were you -- were you asleep?

07:07.136 --> 07:08.046
Um...

07:09.972 --> 07:10.802
No.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.004
What were you doing?

07:15.477 --> 07:18.093
l was -- l was with someone.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.230
Donna was there?

07:23.777 --> 07:24.766
Who's -- who's Donna?

07:26.196 --> 07:27.652
[Walt]
D-Donna's, um --

07:27.865 --> 07:29.150
She's his girlfriend.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.280
[clears throat]

07:39.793 --> 07:41.704
Is she here, too?

07:41.921 --> 07:43.331
No, I don't think so.

07:44.924 --> 07:46.255
You haven't found Donna?

07:46.884 --> 07:49.591
Walt, we didn't know we were supposed
to be looking for her, okay?

07:50.930 --> 07:52.136
How long have I been here?

07:53.766 --> 07:54.755
13 hours.

07:55.768 --> 07:56.803
Then he's still here.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.646
-Who's still here?
-Walker Browning.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.846
You're gonna lay down.
Dad,Dad.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.312
Stop it.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.935
-Stop it.
-Shit.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.392
-Come on.
-Nurse!

08:06.612 --> 08:07.852
Walt! Hey.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.019
Help, Nurse!

Dad.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.404
-Sit down.
-[monitor beeping]

08:11.617 --> 08:12.697
-Dad.
-Come on.

08:13.452 --> 08:14.567
Dad, where are you going?

08:14.828 --> 08:15.783
119.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.036
-Dad, stop it.
-Yeah, Ferg.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.530
Dr. Donna Monaghan.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.537
Yes, the psychiatrist.
You need to find her.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.876
Walt, why do you think
that Walker is here?

08:25.089 --> 08:26.249
l handcuffed him to the bed.

08:30.052 --> 08:30.882
Walker.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.799
Uh, no.
My name's Ruth.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.096
He was right here.

08:40.980 --> 08:41.935
Room 119.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.478
Would you like to sit down?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.351
You don't look well.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.689
Sorry.

08:47.987 --> 08:50.399
Where's Walker Browning?
He's supposed to be in that room.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.400
He was released yesterday afternoon.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.231
-Who released him?
-The sheriff.

08:54.660 --> 08:55.900
This is the sheriff.

08:57.496 --> 08:58.997
This is Sheriff Wilkins?

09:00.082 --> 09:01.913
[Cady] Dad, stop.
You can barely walk.

09:02.126 --> 09:04.913
As long as I can do that,
l have to find her.

09:08.507 --> 09:09.747
If Walker was released
yesterday afternoon,

09:09.967 --> 09:12.174
would that have given him
enough time to get to your cabin?

09:12.469 --> 09:13.549
Sure.

09:17.141 --> 09:17.755
[grunts]

09:21.228 --> 09:21.933
Come on.

09:23.564 --> 09:24.349
[grunts]

09:24.565 --> 09:26.146
So, what time were you attacked?

09:29.486 --> 09:30.316
[exhales deeply]

09:30.529 --> 09:31.484
No, I know, I'm just...

09:32.239 --> 09:34.901
I'm just trying to make sense
of the timeline is all, you know?

09:35.576 --> 09:36.861
Walker had a lot to do in...

09:38.537 --> 09:39.993
not a lot of time.

09:42.041 --> 09:42.871
Damn it.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.457
[grunts]

09:51.425 --> 09:52.460
[grunting]

09:52.676 --> 09:53.961
Okay, this is ridiculous.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.051
-No, I got it.
-No, you don't. Here.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.470
-I got it, Vic.
-|t's fine.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.547
Here, hold on.
Just give me your foot.

10:01.060 --> 10:01.890
Give me your foot.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.183
Okay.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.385
Okay.
All right.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.604
Here.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.680
Thanks.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.976
Maybe you should stop flattering yourself.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.020
Maybe this isn't all about you, you know?

10:15.449 --> 10:18.691
What?
Me getting shot in my house?

10:20.287 --> 10:22.198
And Dr. Monaghan disappearing,
yeah.

10:24.583 --> 10:27.746
Maybe this is all about her,
and you're the collateral damage.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.206
Think about it, Walt.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.038
One of her patients attempts suicide
and then sets her van on fire?

10:35.219 --> 10:38.837
Stopped at the hospital.
Why aren't you there?

10:39.056 --> 10:40.887
Because he refuses to listen
to anyone who cares about him.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.931
Any sign of Donna, Ferg?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.259
Uh, no answer on her home phone.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.102
She wasn't scheduled to work today.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.271
| asked the Sheridan P.D.
to stop by her house.

10:50.484 --> 10:51.690
My boots.

10:51.902 --> 10:53.017
[grunts]

10:53.904 --> 10:54.859
Um...

10:55.739 --> 10:58.446
Also, Doc Weston told me
to give you these.

11:07.835 --> 11:10.747
[straining] Put out an APB on Donna.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.838
Have Ruby call
every hospital in the state.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.082
[exhales deeply]

11:18.595 --> 11:23.510
[breathing heavily]

11:23.725 --> 11:25.636
I don't think I can be any more clear.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.148
Is there a reason
you're not doing what I asked?

11:30.607 --> 11:31.767
Actually, yeah.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.520
I think somebody should be looking
for Zach.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.067
When was the last time you saw him?

11:36.280 --> 11:37.565
When I fired him.

11:38.657 --> 11:39.612
Why?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.486
Well, the last time I saw him,

11:41.702 --> 11:45.069
he'd started drinking again
and he was in a pretty dark place.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.619
Oh, come on. You think that Zach shot Walt
and kidnapped Dr. Monaghan?

11:49.835 --> 11:50.699
My belt.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.501
What do you think, Walt?

11:59.094 --> 12:01.801
Well... I don't, uh...

12:03.348 --> 12:07.341
I don't remember
the actual -- actual event.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.051
-Well, then you don't know --
-I don't!

12:10.105 --> 12:10.855
Okay?!

12:11.064 --> 12:12.474
I don't remember!

12:14.985 --> 12:17.772
I don't know if it was --
it was Walker Browning or...

12:19.156 --> 12:22.523
one of Donna's patients,
or the guy I just fired.

12:23.202 --> 12:24.157
I don't know.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.445
ljust--

12:38.008 --> 12:41.125
Then let's go see if we can't
clear some things up, okay?

12:41.345 --> 12:42.460
-Yep.
-Okay.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.971
[door opens]

13:17.673 --> 13:18.833
Did you hear him break in?

13:19.841 --> 13:20.967
Maybe.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.257
So, they kicked through the front door.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.347
You got shot there?

13:34.982 --> 13:36.973
Or is that where Cady found you?

13:37.192 --> 13:38.102
Uh...

13:41.738 --> 13:46.027
I guess, uh,
the shooter must've hit me in my room

13:46.243 --> 13:48.029
and l crawled out here.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.454
You got shot through the door?

13:53.667 --> 13:55.077
I guess so.

13:55.294 --> 13:58.536
So it's not that you can't remember
who shot you.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.715
You didn't even see him?

14:02.134 --> 14:05.376
[high-pitched ringing]

14:05.595 --> 14:07.631
This must be where you were
when you got hit.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.093
I'll see if I can find the slugs.

14:27.034 --> 14:27.773
[sighs]

14:30.329 --> 14:30.988
Found one.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.238
Hey, Ferg,
you got an evidence bag?

14:34.458 --> 14:35.288
Yeah.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.165
What'd you find?

14:49.473 --> 14:50.303
Evidence.

15:00.150 --> 15:01.731
I'm gonna go see
what kind of slugs these are.

15:01.943 --> 15:02.898
.30 caliber.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.277
My rifle's gone.

15:08.367 --> 15:09.982
l was shot with my own rifle.

15:10.494 --> 15:11.825
[sighs]

15:13.789 --> 15:17.953
Bet that's what he used to smash me
in the back of the head, too, so...

15:19.211 --> 15:19.996
[Ferg] Walt.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.541
We got two bullet holes, we got two slugs,
and we got one blood spot,

15:23.757 --> 15:26.499
so at least we know
that Dr. Monaghan didn't get shot.

15:27.511 --> 15:28.466
[Vic] Hey, Walt.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.260
I know you said that you didn't hear
a car approach your cabin,

15:31.473 --> 15:33.634
but isn't it possible
that one did and you didn't hear him

15:33.850 --> 15:35.226
because”.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.343
I don't want to get too personal, but...

15:41.525 --> 15:42.640
Walker didn't drive here.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.440
We don't know it was Walker.

15:44.653 --> 15:47.190
-He drove away.
-In a getaway car?

15:47.906 --> 15:49.146
Sort of.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.409
He took my Bronco.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.709
So, he shoots you... but not Donna.

16:06.007 --> 16:09.340
And he drives off in your truck
with her in tow.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.929
This is really starting to seem
like she was the target, Walt.

16:18.270 --> 16:20.056
Who else knew that she was out here?

16:24.734 --> 16:25.860
Just you and me.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.986
That's why I don't think
this is about her.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.572
Somebody tried to hurt me.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.451
[sighs]

16:45.964 --> 16:46.794
[door slams]

17:01.021 --> 17:02.056
So, what now?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.103
Check and see if anybody's responded
to the APB.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.144
And try and track the Bronco,
figure out which way they went.

17:12.407 --> 17:13.738
Vic and l have to make a little trip.

17:19.206 --> 17:23.540
[indistinct shouting]

17:27.839 --> 17:28.919
[Man] Come on, hustle!

17:29.132 --> 17:30.338
All right!

17:30.550 --> 17:31.926
[Man #2] Come on, now!
Let's go!

17:32.135 --> 17:33.090
[Man] Batter up!

17:33.303 --> 17:35.134
-You see him?
-He's right there.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.211
[Walt] Hey, Jim.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.804
You know, Walt, sometimes I wonder
who's looking after your county

17:42.020 --> 17:43.635
when you're over here in mine.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.562
Where's Walker Browning?
I know you released him from the hospital.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.558
This is not really a good time right now.

17:49.778 --> 17:51.939
I'm gonna sing the national anthem here
in just a minute.

17:52.155 --> 17:53.395
-You let a criminal go.
-Did I?

17:54.157 --> 17:55.442
What crime did he commit, anyways?

17:55.659 --> 17:58.150
From what I understand,
you guys didn't charge him with anything.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.237
-He was trying to murder Gab Langton.
-Well, that's not the story I heard.

18:01.456 --> 18:02.536
And what story did you hear?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.410
Well, the story I heard is about a sheriff

18:04.626 --> 18:06.412
with a bug up his ass about an oil company

18:06.628 --> 18:10.086
trying to pin a rape and murder case
on a couple decent oil workers.

18:10.298 --> 18:11.799
When he couldn't make that stick,

18:12.008 --> 18:14.044
then he stalks them into the woods
and ambushed them.

18:14.261 --> 18:17.048
That's a lie. Walker and Trot Simic
were trying to kill Gab.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.006
-They'd have killed me, too, if! --
-Yeah, if you hadn't shot first.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.386
You really think I'd lie about this, Jim?

18:22.602 --> 18:25.514
I think you've been under a lot of
pressure these last couple months, Walt.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.516
I think it's clouded your judgment.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.810
He did this to me.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.893
He shot me, and he abducted this woman.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.899
Now I need to find her.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.778
I know you got a blind spot where
the oil companies are concerned, Jim.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.734
But I never thought you'd go this far.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.240
God damn it, Walt.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.619
Your self-righteous habit
of accusing people without any evidence

18:46.835 --> 18:50.293
is gonna get you into a shitload
of trouble someday, and soon.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.792
Like the next time you come into my county
without a proper warrant.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.760
[gate closes]

19:05.729 --> 19:10.940
[piano playing]

19:21.620 --> 19:25.613
[playing continues]

19:30.670 --> 19:31.750
[sighs]

19:33.214 --> 19:37.298
When we get to the Newett oil field,
you keep the work site office occupied.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.001
I'll take a look around for Walker.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.172
Vic, where are you going?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.007
Do you really think

19:46.186 --> 19:49.678
that Walker Browning
is gonna escape captivity, shoot you,

19:49.898 --> 19:51.934
and then head back to work?

19:53.193 --> 19:54.933
-He's gone, Walt.
-So where are we going?

19:55.153 --> 19:57.109
We're expanding our search
for Dr. Monaghan

19:57.322 --> 20:00.655
to include people who actually
had something to do with Dr. Monaghan.

20:00.867 --> 20:04.701
Jesus, Walt, we both saw that smoldering
van after one of her patients torched it.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.579
The least we could do
is try and figure out who that patient is

20:08.792 --> 20:10.032
and get an address for him.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.664
-Fine.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.542
Did I give you the impression
that I was asking permission?

20:16.758 --> 20:17.873
Because I wasn't.

21:02.387 --> 21:03.217
[cellphone rings]

21:03.430 --> 21:04.761
[cellphone beeps]

21:04.973 --> 21:06.088
Yeah, Ferg?

21:06.307 --> 21:07.638
I found Walt's Bronco.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.345
I'm right here, Ferg.

21:10.562 --> 21:11.722
Where '3 my truck?

21:12.814 --> 21:15.351
It's about a quarter mile from your cabin.

21:15.567 --> 21:16.602
The keys are still in it.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.183
What about my rifle?

21:19.696 --> 21:20.856
No. No sign of it.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.903
But it looks like
there was another car parked here.

21:26.119 --> 21:28.075
I'm thinking the shooter stashed his car

21:28.288 --> 21:30.153
and snuck up to your place on foot.

21:32.876 --> 21:35.413
Hey, Ferg, is there any sign
that Donna was in the Bronco?

21:36.171 --> 21:37.411
Nothing obvious.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.588
I'll have it towed to the print shed
so I can take a more thorough look.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.673
At least there isn't any blood.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.547
That's a good sign.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.054
[grunts]

21:57.817 --> 21:59.978
We need to see
Dr. Monaghan's patient files.

22:00.195 --> 22:03.107
You know we can't do that.
We've got HIPAA restrictions.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.735
We understand that
doctor-patient privilege normally applies,

22:05.950 --> 22:07.690
but Dr. Monaghan is missing.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.904
-Have you heard from her?
-We weren't expecting her today.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.159
We think that she was abducted
by one of her patients.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.582
-This is important.
-And so is the privacy of our patients.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.660
Look, if you're telling the truth,

22:18.880 --> 22:22.122
you won't have any trouble getting
a judge to write you a limited warrant.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.957
-We don't have time for that.
-[chuckles]

22:24.177 --> 22:26.668
You had time to drive all the way over
from another county.

22:27.764 --> 22:28.719
And what does that mean?

22:29.390 --> 22:30.596
If Donna really was missing,

22:30.809 --> 22:33.391
I would expect to see the Sheridan police.

22:33.603 --> 22:36.970
Really? Okay.
'Cause she disappeared in our county

22:37.190 --> 22:41.399
two days after her car was firebombed
in our county, so, you know.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.394
-Oh!
-Call an ambulance!

22:44.614 --> 22:46.479
Walt!
Come on!

22:47.408 --> 22:49.364
What are you -- what are you waiting for?!

22:49.577 --> 22:52.114
-lt's -- it's dead.
-Well, then go find another one!

22:52.997 --> 22:54.578
Walt?
Walt?

22:54.791 --> 22:57.032
Are you okay?
Walt!

22:57.252 --> 22:59.709
[door closes]
You are a genius.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.252
[grunting]

23:05.844 --> 23:06.879
Walt.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.380
Hey.

23:08.596 --> 23:09.381
Come on.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.552
Give me a hand.

23:12.392 --> 23:15.384
Walt, come on, man.
There's, like, tons of files.

23:15.603 --> 23:19.437
Walt! You know, I could use
a little help over here.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.014
Walt!

23:21.776 --> 23:23.186
Walt?

23:23.403 --> 23:25.064
Walt, wake up.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.645
Walt, are you okay?

23:26.865 --> 23:28.230
Are you okay?

23:31.411 --> 23:33.493
You're not gonna kiss me again, are you?

23:33.705 --> 23:34.945
[sighs]

23:36.416 --> 23:37.872
The paramedics are on their way.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.917
No, no.
No, that's, uh...

23:41.129 --> 23:43.415
-Okay.
-That's not necessary.

23:43.631 --> 23:46.008
I'm, uh -- I'm fine.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.798
Really.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.339
I'm fine.

23:51.556 --> 23:52.762
Thank you.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.597
We're gonna come back with a warrant,
ma'am, okay?

24:06.863 --> 24:08.228
I'm taking you to the hospital.

24:13.745 --> 24:14.530
I'm fine.

24:14.746 --> 24:17.203
No, you're obviously not fine.
You passed out.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.497
A few minutes ago,
you thought that was brilliant.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.665
A few minutes ago,
I thought you were faking it.

24:22.587 --> 24:24.043
I just need something to eat.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.120
-Did you take the pills?
-They make me drowsy.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.582
I can't go to sleep.
I have to find Donna.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.757
-Walt.
-Just take me to the arson inve--

24:54.118 --> 24:54.903
Happy?

24:55.119 --> 24:56.495
Ecstatic.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.160
Did you?

25:06.381 --> 25:07.370
[tires screech]

25:07.590 --> 25:09.626
Damn it, Walt!
Seriously?

25:09.842 --> 25:12.800
You know, I know that this isn't
a normal missing person for you

25:13.012 --> 25:17.346
and that you care about her
or love her or whatever.

25:19.686 --> 25:23.429
And maybe I don't care about her
as much as you do,

25:23.648 --> 25:25.184
but I care about you, okay?

25:36.995 --> 25:38.656
And don't, okay?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.281
I'm not jealous.

25:40.498 --> 25:41.863
That kiss --

25:42.083 --> 25:43.038
Vic.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.710
It wasn't me making a move, okay?

25:44.877 --> 25:48.665
It was me... moving on.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.291
All right?

25:50.508 --> 25:52.624
And if you really, really want
to help Donna,

25:52.844 --> 25:54.425
you're gonna have to take care
of yourself,

25:54.637 --> 25:56.719
and if that means being drowsy,
then so be it.

25:56.931 --> 25:57.920
Okay?

25:59.350 --> 26:00.305
Now open your mouth.

26:00.518 --> 26:01.553
Vic.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.270
Open your damn mouth.

26:06.983 --> 26:07.847
Swallow.

26:17.702 --> 26:18.737
Show me.

26:21.497 --> 26:22.407
Tongue.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.492
You are like a frickin' four-year-old.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.421
Ow.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.106
[knock on door]

26:51.319 --> 26:52.479
It is open.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.026
[door opens]

26:54.238 --> 26:55.944
[Vic]
Okay, watch your step.

27:00.411 --> 27:01.912
Walt, what are you doing here?

27:03.206 --> 27:05.162
-He said he called you.
-He lied.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.456
I meant to call.

27:07.668 --> 27:10.660
His house is a crime scene.
He can't sleep there.

27:12.548 --> 27:13.754
You should be at the hospital.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.217
l was.

27:15.426 --> 27:16.962
Not when I stopped by.

27:17.804 --> 27:21.422
He checked himself out
because he's invincible.

27:22.558 --> 27:23.889
So, can he stay?

27:24.102 --> 27:26.639
I got to get back to work
and start going over some patient files.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.970
-Of course.
-l'm going with you, Vic.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.397
Go.
I will keep him restrained.

27:31.609 --> 27:32.394
Thank you.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.492
So, the last time you were here,
I drew you a map to the Crow Reservation.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.240
Is that what got you shot?

27:46.415 --> 27:47.541
lthink so.

27:48.626 --> 27:50.662
I ran into Walker Browning out there.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.336
How did he know where to find Gab?

27:55.800 --> 27:56.880
I don't know.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.172
Did he get her?
Is she okay?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.386
She's fine.

28:03.558 --> 28:04.968
She got away.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.846
But...
[groans]

28:08.062 --> 28:10.724
...Trot Simic is dead.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.055
Shot

28:13.651 --> 28:14.561
Who shot him?

28:15.278 --> 28:16.563
I don't know.

28:17.780 --> 28:18.815
I thought I had him, Henry.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.407
[moans]

28:20.616 --> 28:21.526
Trot?

28:21.701 --> 28:23.487
Uh, no.

28:23.703 --> 28:24.658
Walker.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.282
He got away, too.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.203
And now he's got Donna.

28:31.419 --> 28:32.784
Who is Donna?

28:34.589 --> 28:39.003
She's a... psychiatrist.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.675
[sighs]

28:48.060 --> 28:49.266
Well...

28:49.478 --> 28:50.263
[grunts]

28:52.064 --> 28:54.020
...l have been busy, too.

28:58.029 --> 28:59.769
I will tell you about it
some other time.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.122
Hey, Ferg, what did you do
with the prescription records?

29:20.343 --> 29:25.554
Uh, they're, um... right next
to the, uh, bipolar cases.

29:25.765 --> 29:26.800
Okay.

29:28.726 --> 29:29.966
[sighs]

29:31.520 --> 29:32.851
Vic.

29:33.064 --> 29:38.024
-Yeah?
-I found a blonde hair in Walt's Bronco.

29:40.363 --> 29:43.070
Yeah, no, I mean, we sort of figured
that she was in the Bronco, so --

29:43.282 --> 29:44.613
It was in the way back.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.161
Shit.

29:55.920 --> 29:56.830
Uh...

29:58.506 --> 29:59.461
Could be mine.

30:01.050 --> 30:02.881
I was back there with Tyler Malone.

30:03.427 --> 30:04.758
Should I tell Walt about it?

30:04.971 --> 30:06.802
No.
No, don't.

30:07.014 --> 30:10.472
Um... he doesn't need the extra stress.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.137
Um...

30:15.815 --> 30:18.477
Find a lab, run it against mine.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.858
And if it's a match,

30:22.321 --> 30:25.939
then there's no need to worry him, okay?

30:29.328 --> 30:30.738
[door opens]

30:30.955 --> 30:33.071
-[Walt] What do you got there, Ferg?
-What?

30:33.291 --> 30:34.076
Nothing.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.871
How did you sleep?

30:39.088 --> 30:40.794
Lot better than you two, looks like.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.338
-So, uh --
-Here.

30:42.550 --> 30:43.960
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.304
Anybody got a line
on Walker Browning's whereabouts?

30:47.513 --> 30:50.255
No. We've been going through
Dr. Monaghan's patient files and notebooks

30:50.474 --> 30:53.432
trying to find that patient that
she mentioned after her van got torched.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.350
We found a few suicide attempts

30:55.563 --> 30:57.895
and a bunch more that
Dr. Monaghan seemed to be worried about.

30:58.107 --> 31:01.645
We're focusing
on patients that live in Absaroka

31:01.861 --> 31:03.567
since that's the hospital they went to.

31:03.779 --> 31:05.986
Yeah, but, unfortunately,
we can't, uh, check them

31:06.198 --> 31:09.486
against the date that you saw Donna
at the hospital visiting her patient.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.657
Why not?

31:11.412 --> 31:13.323
'Cause I didn't get them.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.530
We're missing the last three weeks.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.661
And they're the ones we need.

31:17.877 --> 31:21.836
Sure, yeah, but we, um -- we still have
a really good suspect list.

31:22.048 --> 31:26.508
Um, Kyle McCormick, Duncan Butler,
Tamar Smith, Jesse Cruz.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.300
I say we split up and go interview them.

31:28.512 --> 31:30.173
[Walt sighs]

31:31.474 --> 31:33.260
The arson investigation turn anything up?

31:33.476 --> 31:35.057
As of two hours ago, nothing.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.009
[door opens]
Check again.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.890
We got to make sure
we got our ducks in a row

31:39.106 --> 31:41.142
before we start running down
Donna's patients.

31:41.359 --> 31:43.520
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, Punk.

31:43.736 --> 31:47.103
Is that what all this is?
These are Donna's patient files?

31:47.323 --> 31:50.486
Not all of them.
We're missing the last few weeks.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.693
Please tell me you got these
from a Special Master.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.198
What's that?

31:56.165 --> 31:59.623
Uh, the guy that
the judge would normally appoint

31:59.835 --> 32:02.793
to, uh, decide which files we can look at.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.711
Normally.
Yeah.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.130
So, not in this case.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.919
Okay, I guess you'll just have to claim
that you're not in your right mind.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.173
Yeah, he's not.

32:12.390 --> 32:14.597
You know, under the circumstances,

32:14.809 --> 32:17.221
I'll pay whatever fines they impose.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.937
"Fines"?

32:19.146 --> 32:21.307
Dad, you have a major civil suit pending.

32:22.817 --> 32:25.183
If they find out
that you're illegally seizing files --

32:25.861 --> 32:27.522
Cady, they don't even know
that these are gone.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.070
Good.
Then you can give them back,

32:30.282 --> 32:32.443
and you can get a judge
to appoint a Special Master.

32:32.660 --> 32:34.651
Then what?
Wait?

32:35.371 --> 32:36.360
Donna's missing.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.832
You know, once I found myself
in similar circumstances,

32:39.041 --> 32:42.533
and someone once told me that I could get
the same information a different way.

32:42.753 --> 32:43.583
A legal way.

32:43.796 --> 32:44.706
Hey.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.379
Walt, we haven't been
to Dr. Monaghan's house yet.

32:47.591 --> 32:49.547
You know,
maybe the missing files are there.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.302
Okay, Ferg, um, go to the hospital,

32:54.515 --> 32:56.221
see if you can convince someone
to give you

32:56.434 --> 33:00.052
the name of that suicidal patient
that Dr. Monaghan visited last week.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.065
Was there something else?

33:12.575 --> 33:13.439
Well...

33:15.202 --> 33:16.032
Not really.

33:16.245 --> 33:18.486
No, l was just checking
to see if you were okay.

33:19.206 --> 33:20.412
What happened to your eye?

33:26.338 --> 33:28.545
I was, uh -- it was an accident.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.088
I'm fine.

33:30.301 --> 33:32.087
Good.
So am I.

33:37.683 --> 33:38.342
[door closes]

33:49.069 --> 33:50.024
[handle rattles]

33:53.491 --> 33:54.150
[sighs]

33:54.366 --> 33:56.982
Doesn't anybody lock their doors
in this state?

34:00.331 --> 34:01.320
Huh.

34:02.458 --> 34:03.413
What?

34:04.293 --> 34:07.126
Nothing.
It's just not what I expected from Donna.

34:07.922 --> 34:09.128
You been here before?

34:09.673 --> 34:10.378
Once.

34:11.383 --> 34:16.548
I brought her by after the van fire
to pick up some things.

34:17.973 --> 34:19.679
How long's she lived here?

34:19.892 --> 34:21.382
I'm not sure.

34:23.979 --> 34:27.187
This is a really nice place
for someone working at a V.A. clinic.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.310
Where'd she get her money?

34:30.319 --> 34:31.354
I don't know.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.692
How well do you really know Donna, Walt?

34:43.916 --> 34:45.907
These look like the ones
you found in her office.

34:48.212 --> 34:51.830
[door creaks]

35:41.015 --> 35:42.255
[Vic] It's clear.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.517
[grunts]

35:49.148 --> 35:49.978
[Walt] Hey!

35:51.025 --> 35:51.810
Hey!

35:52.651 --> 35:54.642
-Okay, Vic?
-Yeah.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.272
Get up!
Come on.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.945
-Who the hell are you?
-I could ask you the same thing.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.154
I'm the sheriff.
Let me see some I.D.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.408
Look, I don't have any.

36:07.625 --> 36:08.705
You don't have a wallet?

36:09.251 --> 36:11.116
-Go ahead.
-Easy.

36:11.337 --> 36:12.998
You can pat me down.

36:19.219 --> 36:20.299
Nothing.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.549
What are you doing here?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.135
Visiting my mom.

36:28.854 --> 36:30.719
I didn't know that Donna had a son.

36:32.441 --> 36:33.647
Neither did I.

36:41.659 --> 36:43.695
Hi, there.
Sorry to bother you.

36:43.911 --> 36:45.321
Uh, my name is Deputy Ferguson

36:45.537 --> 36:47.243
with the Absaroka County
Sheriff's Department.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.912
That explains the outfit.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.038
Right.

36:52.044 --> 36:54.456
Uh, anyway,
I'm one of the lead investigators

36:54.672 --> 36:56.333
on a missing-persons case.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.209
I'm really hoping
you can help me with something.

36:58.425 --> 36:59.084
|.D.?

37:01.553 --> 37:02.542
Okay.

37:08.852 --> 37:12.845
Now, our missing person interacted
with someone here a few days ago.

37:13.065 --> 37:16.307
A patient who had recently
attempted suicide.

37:16.527 --> 37:17.607
I'm hoping you can tell me --

37:17.820 --> 37:19.151
-Can%.
-No?

37:19.363 --> 37:20.773
I mean,
I think if you'll let me explain --

37:20.989 --> 37:23.651
Then I would just be wasting
both of our time.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.859
Look,
this was one of Dr. Monaghan's patients,

37:27.079 --> 37:29.661
and Dr. Monaghan
is our missing person, so --

37:29.873 --> 37:33.206
So take it up
with someone in administration.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.955
The doctor can be in real danger.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.128
Above my pay grade, Detective Ferguson.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.338
[sighs]

37:49.184 --> 37:49.843
Hey, listen.

37:51.019 --> 37:52.008
I don't know
what you've been telling everybody,

37:52.229 --> 37:54.185
but I never met you before in my life.
-Excuse me?

37:54.398 --> 37:56.104
So, stop going around telling people

37:56.316 --> 37:58.523
that I'm the one
that gave you the name Tamar Smith.

37:58.736 --> 38:00.977
I'm sorry. I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

38:01.196 --> 38:04.814
Right, because I'm not the one who gave
you the name of Dr. Monaghan's patient.

38:06.243 --> 38:07.574
I don't know how you got it.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.365
Tamar Smith?

38:24.595 --> 38:25.710
[sighs]

38:27.014 --> 38:28.504
[door opens]

38:31.769 --> 38:33.805
It took you guys that long
to Google a name?

38:36.190 --> 38:37.555
That's not how we do it, Andy.

38:37.775 --> 38:39.231
It's Andrew.

38:39.443 --> 38:42.776
Right.
Andrew Price.

38:43.530 --> 38:47.239
We're still waiting
on the San Francisco P.D. to confirm that.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.533
[scoffs]
They sending it via the Pony Express?

38:49.745 --> 38:51.155
Well, it'd be a lot quicker

38:51.371 --> 38:53.111
if you hadn't left your wallet
in California.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.290
Look, man, I'm telling you,
Donna Monaghan is my mother.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.867
Can't you just call her?

38:58.086 --> 39:00.168
Why don't you have the same last name,
Andrew?

39:01.590 --> 39:02.830
I kept my father's name.

39:03.050 --> 39:05.632
Well, if you're her son, why did you run?

39:06.970 --> 39:08.551
'Cause I thought you were someone else.

39:10.474 --> 39:12.055
[sighs]

39:12.267 --> 39:13.882
I'm in a little financial trouble,

39:14.102 --> 39:16.684
and not all my investors are very patient.

39:16.897 --> 39:18.103
What kind of financial trouble?

39:18.315 --> 39:20.727
The kind where you don't have the money.

39:21.985 --> 39:26.524
Look, starting a nightclub isn't easy,
and financing is, well, creative.

39:26.740 --> 39:29.447
Right. Like stealing
from your supposed mother

39:29.660 --> 39:30.570
when she's not around.

39:30.786 --> 39:32.447
Uh, what's that quote?

39:32.663 --> 39:34.870
Family are the ones who,
when you have nowhere left to go,

39:35.082 --> 39:36.447
they have to take you in.

39:40.754 --> 39:41.789
Robert Frost.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.668
Uh, actually, it's home, not family.

39:46.969 --> 39:50.336
Either way, Donna never mentioned you.

39:52.099 --> 39:53.760
Oh, I get it now.

39:53.976 --> 39:55.261
You're screwing her.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.308
Funny. I mean, you're not really her type.

39:57.521 --> 39:59.307
She does like to mix it up, though.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.560
Unpredictability has led her
to be attracted to all sorts of guys.

40:02.776 --> 40:06.109
Oh, I'm real sorry.
You're -- you're not the first.

40:06.864 --> 40:08.445
But I'd be careful, though.

40:08.657 --> 40:10.818
My pops is still all messed up about her.

40:12.494 --> 40:14.030
When'd you see your mother last?

40:14.246 --> 40:16.783
Uh, we rang in the New Year together,
actually.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.864
She gave me a list of resolutions,

40:19.084 --> 40:22.918
a list of ways I could be
a more successful, more miserable person.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.166
She calls it being a realist.

40:25.382 --> 40:27.043
I say it's her being a bitch.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.086
Well, you seem angry with her.

40:30.012 --> 40:31.548
You think I'm exaggerating.

40:32.723 --> 40:33.553
You just wait.

40:34.683 --> 40:35.923
Donna's missing.

40:36.143 --> 40:39.226
Like I said, she does what she wants
whenever she wants.

40:39.438 --> 40:40.598
Not this time.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.273
She's been abducted.

40:44.234 --> 40:46.520
Well, if I were you,
I'd check the previous guy.

40:46.737 --> 40:48.398
-What previous guy?
-I don't know, man.

40:48.614 --> 40:52.072
But there's always a previous boyfriend.
She does tend to overlap.

40:52.784 --> 40:54.695
Not everyone takes too kindly to that.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.945
[knock on door, door opens]

40:59.124 --> 41:00.239
-[Ferg] Sheriff.
-Yeah?

41:04.588 --> 41:06.078
Ferg.

41:06.298 --> 41:09.131
Lock him up
and see if anything he's saying is true.

41:09.343 --> 41:14.463
And I need you to look into
Donna's ex-husband, any other, um...

41:15.223 --> 41:16.963
-Boyfriends?
-Uh-huh.

41:17.184 --> 41:18.970
-Do you have something else?
-Yeah.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.681
I got the name
of Donna's suicidal patient.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.782
Good afternoon, sir.

41:44.002 --> 41:44.991
Ma'am.

41:45.212 --> 41:46.577
Are you Tamar Smith?

41:46.797 --> 41:47.957
Yes, sir.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.960
-Did I do something wrong, sir?
-No.

41:51.176 --> 41:53.633
No, we just need to ask you
a few questions, Tamar.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.464
About what?

41:55.681 --> 41:59.048
About Dr. Monaghan.
She's missing.

41:59.267 --> 42:02.259
We're talking to the last people
who might've seen her.

42:03.772 --> 42:05.683
How do you know that I even know her?

42:05.857 --> 42:09.145
The V.A. clinic felt compelled
to give us a list of her patients.

42:09.361 --> 42:12.194
When was the last time
you saw Dr. Monaghan, Tamar?

42:12.406 --> 42:14.362
About three or four days ago.

42:15.242 --> 42:18.951
When you did last see her,
was that at the clinic in Sheridan?

42:19.162 --> 42:20.572
No, ma'am.
I don't go to that clinic.

42:20.789 --> 42:21.778
It's...

42:23.959 --> 42:24.994
It's a little scary.

42:26.003 --> 42:27.618
There's a lot of crazies there.

42:27.838 --> 42:29.123
[chuckles]

42:29.339 --> 42:30.499
Where do you see her?

42:31.341 --> 42:35.584
Dr. Monaghan makes house calls.
She has a mobile unit.

42:35.804 --> 42:37.294
Really like a van.

42:37.514 --> 42:40.176
That mobile unit was firebombed
a few days ago.

42:40.392 --> 42:41.598
Firebombed?

42:41.810 --> 42:42.799
Someone broke a window

42:43.020 --> 42:44.851
and threw a Molotov cocktail inside.

42:45.063 --> 42:49.648
That was just this past Tuesday
between 3:00 and 3:30 in the afternoon.

42:49.860 --> 42:51.225
Where were you then?

42:55.073 --> 42:56.609
Do you know anything about that?

42:57.826 --> 42:59.032
Um...

43:01.204 --> 43:05.994
Okay, Tamar, we're gonna need
to take a look around inside.

43:06.209 --> 43:07.540
Yeah.

43:29.983 --> 43:31.814
So, I'm still waiting for you to tell me

43:32.027 --> 43:36.316
where you were
between 3:00 and 3:30 on Tuesday.

43:37.657 --> 43:40.148
l was in the hospital, sir.
I had an accident.

43:43.205 --> 43:45.287
Well, I'm glad you're okay now.

43:50.629 --> 43:51.789
Are you okay?

43:54.716 --> 43:56.001
Not really.

43:57.677 --> 44:00.965
Dr. Monaghan would tell me to talk it out.

44:03.266 --> 44:05.006
Hold on a second.

44:11.274 --> 44:12.650
Here's the thing.

44:15.487 --> 44:18.445
You make me nervous, sir.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.191
You look a lot like my commanding officer.

44:23.578 --> 44:26.570
And he was pretty...

44:29.626 --> 44:30.661
commanding.

44:42.180 --> 44:45.968
I'll reach out to the hospital
and confirm what time she was discharged.

44:48.478 --> 44:49.638
You gonna pass out again?

44:52.107 --> 44:53.768
-What?
-Jesus, Walt.

44:53.984 --> 44:55.645
Sit down.
You look terrible.

44:55.861 --> 44:58.022
And you're having a hard time
focusing on what I'm saying.

44:58.238 --> 45:00.820
I'm fine. I... ljust wasn't
listening to you, Vic.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.488
-|, uh...
-Oh.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.737
l was thinking about Molotov cocktails.

45:05.453 --> 45:06.738
What about them?

45:07.956 --> 45:13.326
Throwing a Molotov cocktail into a van
is a different act than overdosing.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.378
One's aggressive, the other's passive.

45:17.257 --> 45:18.417
Different people.

45:19.926 --> 45:22.212
Donna always said it was a patient.

45:22.429 --> 45:26.217
Um, I assumed
it was the same suicidal patient

45:26.433 --> 45:28.344
she was visiting at the hospital, but...

45:28.560 --> 45:31.142
She also said
that they missed a couple of appointments.

45:31.354 --> 45:32.309
Foun

45:32.522 --> 45:34.262
Their last four appointments.

45:34.482 --> 45:37.565
One of the things that I took
from Donna's house was her calendar.

45:37.736 --> 45:40.899
Maybe we can figure out which patient
missed her last four sessions.

45:41.114 --> 45:42.354
Yeah.

45:46.161 --> 45:47.150
[sighs]

46:00.634 --> 46:01.874
Are you kidding me?

46:05.263 --> 46:07.094
I told you,
you have to take those files back.

46:07.307 --> 46:08.968
This is serious.

46:14.064 --> 46:14.928
Dad?

46:16.858 --> 46:18.519
What am I missing?

46:19.653 --> 46:20.642
What?

46:24.074 --> 46:25.939
I can't remember anything.

46:27.285 --> 46:31.244
I, uh -- I should be the one
to -- to help her,

46:31.456 --> 46:33.913
to know everything that happened,

46:43.843 --> 46:45.629
It's not your fault.

46:47.889 --> 46:51.802
You were shot and you have a concussion.

46:53.687 --> 46:55.143
You were there.

46:55.355 --> 46:57.721
-What did I miss?
-I don't know.

47:00.068 --> 47:02.024
When I walked in, you were on the floor,

47:02.237 --> 47:07.027
and then H ran into your room
and I found a bloody sheet,

47:07.242 --> 47:09.324
and I brought it back
to try and stop the bleeding.

47:11.621 --> 47:13.407
And then I called 911.

47:14.749 --> 47:15.829
Did I say anything?

47:16.042 --> 47:17.452
Where is she?

47:20.422 --> 47:22.037
You kept saying, "Where is she?"

47:24.175 --> 47:25.426
I thought you meant Mom.

47:27.220 --> 47:28.084
Right.

47:29.347 --> 47:30.302
I'm sorry.

47:32.475 --> 47:33.339
If I'd known,

47:33.560 --> 47:36.347
maybe I could've gotten Vic and Ferg
to start searching for Donna sooner.

47:36.563 --> 47:37.518
It's my fault.

47:39.107 --> 47:41.189
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about Donna.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.770
I just -- I didn't know --

47:43.987 --> 47:45.443
That I'd like it.

47:47.157 --> 47:50.775
You were protecting my feelings.
I get it.

47:52.037 --> 47:53.698
And I appreciate it.

47:55.832 --> 47:57.368
And I'm also pretty sick of it.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.587
'Cause I do the same thing.

48:01.796 --> 48:04.082
You know, I-I keep secrets from you

48:05.342 --> 48:07.082
because I don't want to disappoint you.

48:07.677 --> 48:09.087
What secrets?

48:09.304 --> 48:10.339
Not now.

48:13.183 --> 48:14.844
What secrets, Cady?

48:19.689 --> 48:21.771
I got a job.

48:23.943 --> 48:25.934
Congratulations.

48:28.281 --> 48:30.488
I'm working for Jacob Nighthorse.

48:33.411 --> 48:35.117
[footsteps approaching]

48:36.039 --> 48:37.154
Not now, Vic.

48:37.374 --> 48:38.409
Okay.

48:39.751 --> 48:41.116
[door closes]

48:41.336 --> 48:43.327
I'm not working directly for him,

48:43.546 --> 48:46.003
but he's funding
a legal-aid operation on the Res,

48:46.216 --> 48:47.706
and he asked me to run it.

48:50.303 --> 48:52.089
That's why I came to your cabin.

48:52.305 --> 48:53.920
I came to tell you, Dad.

48:54.891 --> 48:57.382
I think this job
is the perfect opportunity because --

48:57.602 --> 49:00.059
Because you're my daughter.
He's using you.

49:00.271 --> 49:02.478
-Thanks for the vote of confidence.
-Think about it.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.066
Idid.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.812
This casino is here
whether we like it or not.

49:07.737 --> 49:10.444
And if I can use those funds
to help people...

49:12.826 --> 49:14.737
I think Mom would've liked that.

49:16.371 --> 49:18.032
I know this hurts you, Dad.

49:18.248 --> 49:21.081
Just like the idea
of someone taking Mom's place hurts me.

49:24.045 --> 49:26.661
But I think it's time
we move on with our lives

49:28.675 --> 49:29.755
without secrets.

49:38.518 --> 49:42.932
You said you took a bloody sheet
from my room to stop my bleeding.

49:44.566 --> 49:45.681
What?

49:45.900 --> 49:49.313
Are you sure there was already blood
on the sheet when you used it?

49:51.865 --> 49:53.355
Yeah.

49:57.454 --> 49:59.115
I have to get back to work.

50:04.586 --> 50:05.416
So do I.

50:05.628 --> 50:06.743
[door opens]

50:06.963 --> 50:08.123
-Hey.
-Vic.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.295
-Donna was shot.
-What?

50:10.508 --> 50:12.044
There were two blood spots in my bedroom.

50:12.260 --> 50:14.125
We missed the second one
because it was on a sheet

50:14.345 --> 50:15.960
that Cady used to stop my bleeding.

50:16.181 --> 50:19.093
Shit, okay.
Well, then I think I know who shot her.

50:19.309 --> 50:22.221
Duncan Butler. He missed
his last four sessions with Donna,

50:22.437 --> 50:25.304
just like the guy that she mentioned
after her van was firebombed.

50:26.483 --> 50:27.393
Good work, Detective.

50:31.488 --> 50:32.694
[Walt]
Are you Duncan Butler?

50:32.906 --> 50:34.988
Look, I turned my music down,
for Christ's sakes, all right?

50:35.200 --> 50:36.656
Why don't you just go
tell the Reynolds to lay off?

50:36.868 --> 50:38.779
You were here three days ago
playing music?

50:38.995 --> 50:40.951
-No, I was at work three days ago.
-Oh.

50:41.164 --> 50:42.529
Well, can your wife verify that?

50:42.749 --> 50:44.034
She can tell you I wasn't here,

50:44.250 --> 50:45.956
and my boss can tell you I was there.

50:46.169 --> 50:47.329
And where is "there"?

50:47.545 --> 50:49.456
Continental Meats in Sheridan.

50:49.672 --> 50:51.003
[Walt]
Oh, Sheridan, huh?

50:51.216 --> 50:54.629
Well, you wouldn't happen to know
a Donna Monaghan?

50:54.844 --> 50:56.050
She works out that way.

50:56.262 --> 50:57.422
No.

50:58.473 --> 51:00.213
Well, she's not the psychiatrist

51:00.433 --> 51:01.843
you've been seeing the last two years?

51:02.060 --> 51:04.722
God damn it!
She's not supposed to talk about that.

51:04.938 --> 51:06.929
-You seem like you're angry with her.
-Yeah, wouldn't you be?

51:07.148 --> 51:10.060
That shit's supposed to be confidential,
and she goes and sics the sheriff on me.

51:10.276 --> 51:12.983
She didn't sic me on you.
She didn't tell me anything about you.

51:13.196 --> 51:14.276
Well, if she didn't tell you,

51:14.489 --> 51:16.275
then you must've broken some laws
finding out I see her.

51:17.325 --> 51:18.735
You know what, I'm calling the ACLU.

51:18.952 --> 51:20.533
When you talk to them,
make sure to mention

51:20.745 --> 51:23.327
that we're investigating someone
who set a van on fire.

51:23.540 --> 51:26.703
-Is that what she told you?
-Like I said, she hasn't told me anything.

51:26.918 --> 51:30.410
Because Donna Monaghan is missing.

51:30.630 --> 51:31.915
Do you know anything about that?

51:34.634 --> 51:36.420
Shit.
Get around back.

51:40.139 --> 51:41.094
[gunshoﬂ

51:42.267 --> 51:43.256
All right.
Let's go get her.

51:43.476 --> 51:44.386
Hey!
[grunts]

51:44.602 --> 51:46.388
Come on.
Drop the gun!

51:47.313 --> 51:49.429
-Whoa, whoa.
-Drop the gun.

51:53.736 --> 51:54.521
Come on.

51:54.988 --> 51:56.944
Look, if she's missing,
we got to go find her.

51:57.156 --> 51:58.316
Who's next on your list?

51:58.533 --> 52:00.774
-Right now, there's just you.
-What?

52:01.786 --> 52:03.367
Hey, I didn't firebomb her van,
all right?

52:03.580 --> 52:04.911
I sure as hell didn't kidnap her.

52:05.123 --> 52:07.830
Then you won't mind if my deputy and me

52:08.042 --> 52:10.419
take a good look around your home.

52:15.091 --> 52:16.547
Fine.

52:20.513 --> 52:23.550
Hey, but every minute you're in there
is a minute we're not looking for Donna.

52:26.436 --> 52:27.516
Okay.

52:29.022 --> 52:30.512
Well, thanks for your help.

52:30.732 --> 52:31.437
Yep.

52:32.650 --> 52:33.685
[sighs]

52:33.901 --> 52:36.438
His boss at Continental Meats confirms

52:36.654 --> 52:38.269
he was in the middle
of an eight-hour shift

52:38.489 --> 52:41.731
when Donna's van got firebombed.

52:41.951 --> 52:44.363
He was also working
when she and I were attacked, so...

52:45.204 --> 52:48.037
So, I guess that leaves
the mysterious Andrew Price.

52:49.167 --> 52:50.748
What do you think our next step is?

52:50.960 --> 52:52.575
Well, I think my next step is sleep.

52:54.213 --> 52:55.043
Seriously?

52:55.882 --> 52:56.746
I mean, that's good.

52:56.966 --> 52:58.297
You're finally talking some sense.

52:58.509 --> 53:00.295
-I'Il give you a ride to Henry's.
-No.

53:00.511 --> 53:04.299
No, I need you to head upstairs,
see if anybody confirmed Andrew's story,

53:04.515 --> 53:06.676
or see if the APB's generated any leads.

53:06.893 --> 53:10.135
-Okay.
-Have Ruby call Henry to come pick me up.

53:10.355 --> 53:11.515
Get some rest, Walt.

53:27.497 --> 53:28.452
What?

53:29.123 --> 53:31.034
I said nothing.

53:31.250 --> 53:33.627
Yeah, but it's in how you said nothing.

53:33.836 --> 53:36.168
-Speak.
-We should not be doing this.

53:36.839 --> 53:37.669
What?

53:38.549 --> 53:42.087
Trying to find the man who attempted to
kill Gab and me at the Crow Reservation

53:42.303 --> 53:43.839
and might have Donna?

53:44.055 --> 53:46.637
I am not saying
that Walker Browning should be ignored,

53:46.849 --> 53:49.465
but maybe given your physical state
and the lawsuit you are facing --

53:49.686 --> 53:53.895
Look, you can drive me
and keep your thoughts to yourself,

53:54.107 --> 53:56.223
or you can set me out right here.

53:56.442 --> 53:59.855
But you cannot drive me and judge me at
the same time.

54:07.078 --> 54:08.318
[gear cranks]

54:09.622 --> 54:11.283
Seriously?

54:11.499 --> 54:13.581
You're gonna make me get out here?

54:14.669 --> 54:15.624
No.

54:15.837 --> 54:18.874
But I do not know which way to turn.
I have never been here before.

54:37.150 --> 54:40.108
Barracks another half mile further on.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.310
The active rig should be right here.

54:45.867 --> 54:48.574
[engine idling]

54:51.622 --> 54:53.362
Hey, shut it off.

54:53.583 --> 54:54.368
[engine quiets]

54:58.171 --> 54:59.377
Shut it off.

54:59.589 --> 55:00.829
[engine stops]

55:01.048 --> 55:02.003
Who are you?

55:02.216 --> 55:03.251
Doug.

55:04.051 --> 55:05.257
What's going on here, Doug?

55:05.470 --> 55:06.459
Doing my job.

55:06.679 --> 55:07.714
You work for Newett Energy?

55:07.930 --> 55:09.511
I do this week.

55:09.724 --> 55:12.466
I'm a private contractor.
Shutdown engineer.

55:12.685 --> 55:14.892
Newett determined
these wells were unproductive,

55:15.104 --> 55:17.595
so they called us in
to plug it and close up shop.

55:17.815 --> 55:19.897
When'd they make that decision?
[cellphone ringing]

55:20.109 --> 55:21.895
Called us two days ago.

55:22.111 --> 55:23.521
Two days ago.

55:24.614 --> 55:25.694
You know Walker Browning?

55:25.907 --> 55:27.397
No, never heard of him.

55:27.617 --> 55:30.154
-HeHo?
-Hey, I got a job for you, Hector.

55:30.369 --> 55:31.870
Now is not a good time.

55:32.079 --> 55:34.240
I'm not sure you understand
how this deal works.

55:34.457 --> 55:35.537
I'm with the sheriff.

55:35.750 --> 55:37.411
Oh, great.
Put him on.

55:37.627 --> 55:40.494
I got some blood samples
I'd like to share with him.

55:40.713 --> 55:43.830
Look, Henry, you don't get to choose
what's a good time or not.

55:44.050 --> 55:45.711
I need Hector now.

55:47.094 --> 55:48.630
I'm probably an hour away.

55:48.846 --> 55:50.507
I'll see you in 45 minutes.
