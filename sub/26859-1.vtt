02:18.997 --> 02:21.931
Hello.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.334
Who are you?

02:23.336 --> 02:24.571
- I'm Dr. Faraday.
- Oh.

02:25.670 --> 02:28.538
I was expecting Granger.

02:28.540 --> 02:30.009
Roderick Ayres.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.417
It's one of your maids,
I understand?

02:40.419 --> 02:42.653
<i>One</i> of our maids?

02:42.655 --> 02:45.822
I like that.

02:45.824 --> 02:47.725
Down the steps on your left.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.628
My sister will fill you in.

03:03.742 --> 03:04.941
Gyp. Gyp!

03:04.943 --> 03:08.112
Sorry. Shh.

03:08.114 --> 03:09.780
He thinks every stranger's
come to cut our throats

03:09.782 --> 03:12.048
and make off
with the last silver spoon.

03:12.050 --> 03:15.052
Dr. Faraday.
Dr. Granger's new partner.

03:15.054 --> 03:17.019
Yeah. Caroline Ayres.

03:17.021 --> 03:19.024
Betty's this way.

03:23.094 --> 03:25.762
Hmm.

03:25.764 --> 03:27.700
Have you been sick
at all, Betty?

03:30.068 --> 03:33.137
And is it a stabbing pain
or a burning pain?

03:33.139 --> 03:34.772
It's like...

03:34.774 --> 03:39.675
a burning pain
with stabs in it?

03:39.677 --> 03:41.811
Right.

03:41.813 --> 03:43.679
Let's have a look at you.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.582
Just relax.

03:45.584 --> 03:48.655
Ow. Ow! Ow!

03:50.955 --> 03:53.823
Could you leave us alone for
a minute, please, Miss Ayres?

03:53.825 --> 03:56.493
Yes, of course.

03:56.495 --> 03:58.495
Come on, Gyp.

04:00.665 --> 04:03.199
Well?

04:06.138 --> 04:09.606
I did feel poorly.

04:09.608 --> 04:11.444
I did.

04:13.878 --> 04:18.084
And I just thought
if I was bad enough...

04:20.586 --> 04:22.786
...that they might
send me home.

04:22.788 --> 04:26.223
What is it?

04:26.225 --> 04:28.492
Is the work too hard?

04:28.494 --> 04:31.765
Are they unkind to you?

04:34.466 --> 04:35.966
Then what is it?

04:39.471 --> 04:40.870
Shh.

04:40.872 --> 04:43.639
Nothing serious.
She'll be fine by tomorrow.

04:43.641 --> 04:45.644
Ha.

04:46.812 --> 04:48.545
Well, thank you.

04:48.547 --> 04:51.081
There's one other thing.
It's a very big house.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.582
Betty's alone down here
at night.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.584
I was...

04:53.586 --> 04:55.752
These silly girls.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.154
You've lived here
all your life, Miss Ayres.

04:58.156 --> 04:59.723
Perhaps you could
reassure Betty.

04:59.725 --> 05:01.661
She's really awfully young.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.562
Right.

05:06.564 --> 05:08.197
Well, let's find Roderick.

05:08.199 --> 05:09.902
You can tell him
how much we owe you.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.710
Rod?

05:20.812 --> 05:23.647
Roddie?

05:23.649 --> 05:26.617
How did you find
the patient, Doctor?

05:26.619 --> 05:29.118
Mrs. Ayres?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.721
Uh, Mother,
this is Dr. Faraday.

05:31.723 --> 05:34.024
He thinks we're brutes.

05:34.026 --> 05:35.759
Little under the weather.

05:35.761 --> 05:37.894
I imagine she'll be quite well
by tomorrow.

05:37.896 --> 05:40.596
You'll observe
a change in Betty yet.

05:40.598 --> 05:42.231
This house works on people.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.901
Girls come here
like specks of grit.

05:44.903 --> 05:47.704
Ten years later,
they leave as pearls.

05:47.706 --> 05:49.106
I expect Dr. Faraday's thinking

05:49.108 --> 05:51.108
Betty won't stick it out
for ten years.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.911
Most girls would rather work
in factories these days,

05:53.913 --> 05:55.312
and who can blame them?

05:55.314 --> 05:57.813
As it happens,
I was thinking of my mother.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.586
She was a maid here
before I was born.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.154
Well...

06:04.156 --> 06:07.291
I do hope she enjoyed her time.

06:07.293 --> 06:10.560
Right. Roderick.

06:10.562 --> 06:12.798
Come on, Gyp.

06:15.233 --> 06:17.169
Wait here, please.

06:25.877 --> 06:27.276
<i>The first time</i>

06:27.278 --> 06:32.315
<i>I saw Hundreds Hall
was July 1919...</i>

06:32.317 --> 06:35.087
<i>an Empire Day fete the summer
after the Great War.</i>

06:39.791 --> 06:41.892
<i>I had passed by its gates
often enough,</i>

06:41.894 --> 06:44.695
<i>never imagining
they would open to me,</i>

06:44.697 --> 06:46.899
<i>a common village boy.</i>

06:49.267 --> 06:53.235
<i>There was bunting and cake
and all manner of games.</i>

06:53.237 --> 06:55.973
<i>And at the heart of it,
the Ayres family.</i>

06:55.975 --> 06:59.308
<i>So happy and handsome
back then.</i>

06:59.310 --> 07:02.678
<i>But it was the house itself,
still in its glory,</i>

07:02.680 --> 07:05.983
<i>which somehow
impressed me terribly.</i>

07:08.019 --> 07:11.855
<i>My mother had described
the place often.</i>

07:11.857 --> 07:15.759
<i>But seeing it myself
for the first time,</i>

07:15.761 --> 07:19.128
<i>nothing could have prepared me
for the spell it cast that day.</i>

07:19.130 --> 07:20.599
Aren't you smart?

07:24.769 --> 07:26.906
Mummy.

07:28.874 --> 07:32.743
Nice and still, please.

07:32.745 --> 07:34.010
It won't be as bad
as you think.

07:34.012 --> 07:36.279
I sincerely hope
you aren't discussing supper.

07:36.281 --> 07:39.783
The National Health Service.

07:39.785 --> 07:42.151
Granger here will be all right.

07:42.153 --> 07:44.086
People like to look up
to their doctors.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.089
Last thing they want
is one of their own.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.324
Rubbish. They want someone
who'll do the job.

07:48.326 --> 07:50.860
Besides, turns out
you've friends in high places.

07:50.862 --> 07:53.096
- Peter said you'd been out to Hundreds.
- Mm.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.231
- Can't believe I missed that call.
- How was it?

07:55.233 --> 07:58.067
The place is a mess.

07:58.069 --> 08:00.736
I'd heard they were pigging it.

08:00.738 --> 08:03.406
Can't get tradesmen,
too many unpaid bills.

08:03.408 --> 08:04.440
Roderick handed me
the shillings

08:04.442 --> 08:05.675
as though they were his last.

08:05.677 --> 08:06.942
Oh, poor boy.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.010
One moment you're
an Air Force hero,

08:08.012 --> 08:10.781
<i>then captain of a sinking ship.</i>

08:10.783 --> 08:12.916
<i>He's still in a good deal</i>

08:12.918 --> 08:14.250
<i>of pain with his leg.</i>

08:14.252 --> 08:16.053
Night, Rod.

08:16.055 --> 08:17.788
<i>There was nervous trouble, too,</i>

08:17.790 --> 08:20.757
<i>apparently, when he came back.</i>

08:20.759 --> 08:22.259
<i>Hardly surprising.</i>

08:22.261 --> 08:23.827
<i>You didn't treat him?</i>

08:23.829 --> 08:25.027
<i>Family closed ranks.</i>

08:25.029 --> 08:26.863
<i>Very hush-hush about it.</i>

08:26.865 --> 08:29.199
<i>No, they brought
Caroline home to nurse him.</i>

08:29.201 --> 08:30.700
<i>Rotten shame, really.</i>

08:30.702 --> 08:32.034
<i>She was doing very well,</i>

08:32.037 --> 08:34.203
<i>commission in the WAAF
or the Wrens.</i>

08:34.206 --> 08:36.142
<i>Awfully brainy girl.</i>

09:51.549 --> 09:54.251
Gyp!

09:54.253 --> 09:56.252
Gyp!

09:56.254 --> 09:58.188
Come here. What on earth
do you think you're doing?

09:58.190 --> 10:00.556
I'm terribly sorry... Oh.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.425
Oh, it's you.

10:02.427 --> 10:04.397
I'm sorry. I-I was racing
a horse and cart.

10:06.030 --> 10:08.330
Well, no harm done, eh?

10:08.332 --> 10:11.167
At least, uh,
he's alive and kicking.

10:16.307 --> 10:18.374
Here.

10:18.376 --> 10:20.576
I mean to pay my fare.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.546
What's wrong with the patient
you're visiting?

10:23.548 --> 10:25.281
Whooping cough.

10:25.283 --> 10:28.584
Try to call in twice a day.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.186
Goodness.

10:30.188 --> 10:32.289
You must be rolling in it.

10:32.291 --> 10:34.089
He's a club patient.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.995
I treat the whole family
for a few shillings a year.

10:39.865 --> 10:41.330
How's Betty?

10:41.332 --> 10:44.033
Ah, well, Rod fixed her up
with a wireless.

10:44.035 --> 10:46.138
Miracle cure.

10:47.405 --> 10:49.039
Oh, look, I-I meant to say,

10:49.041 --> 10:51.340
the day you came
we were ghastly, weren't we?

10:51.342 --> 10:53.243
- Not at all.
- No, no, no, we were.

10:53.245 --> 10:55.512
We've lost the trick
of company.

10:55.514 --> 10:58.951
Mother won't have guests
with the house so shabby.

11:03.889 --> 11:05.622
Are your parents still
in the county?

11:05.624 --> 11:08.624
My mother died some while ago,

11:08.626 --> 11:10.893
Father just last year.

11:10.895 --> 11:12.365
That's what brought me back,
in fact.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.234
Come on, Gyp.

11:18.236 --> 11:20.103
That's it.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.507
You sure you won't come up?

11:24.509 --> 11:25.876
That's kind, but...

11:25.878 --> 11:27.410
Your patient.

11:27.412 --> 11:30.046
Well, Rod will be awfully
jealous I had a ride.

11:30.048 --> 11:31.183
He loves your car.

11:32.884 --> 11:34.550
If you don't mind my saying,

11:34.552 --> 11:37.587
I'm surprised the RAF
didn't make a better job

11:37.589 --> 11:39.321
of patching him up.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.892
Ah.

11:41.894 --> 11:44.560
Well, I'm not sure he wanted
to be patched up.

11:44.562 --> 11:46.363
Hmm.

11:46.365 --> 11:50.065
Look, I know it's a cheek,
but could you talk to him?

11:50.067 --> 11:52.234
I'm not a psychological doctor.

11:52.236 --> 11:54.371
No, he might listen to you.

11:54.373 --> 11:57.009
Sorry, shouldn't have asked.

11:58.176 --> 12:00.576
The matter of his leg.

12:00.578 --> 12:04.915
Might he be more open
to treatment for that?

12:04.917 --> 12:07.416
Yes.

12:07.418 --> 12:09.920
I'll ask him.

12:09.922 --> 12:12.625
Thank you.

12:17.296 --> 12:19.462
Right. Come on, Gyp.

12:19.464 --> 12:20.997
That's it.

12:20.999 --> 12:22.098
<i>Caroline tells me</i>

12:22.100 --> 12:23.499
<i>this is a favor.</i>

12:23.501 --> 12:25.435
Oh, no.

12:25.437 --> 12:28.137
There's a mutual benefit.

12:28.139 --> 12:31.107
You get the treatment
and I write it up.

12:31.109 --> 12:33.075
See, the accepted wisdom
is that induction coils

12:33.077 --> 12:35.545
are only good
for fresh injuries, but, uh,

12:35.547 --> 12:36.713
I've got a hunch.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.181
Good Lord, it's like something
out of <i>Frankenstein.</i>

12:39.183 --> 12:41.050
It's not
as dramatic as it looks,

12:41.052 --> 12:43.252
I promise you.

12:43.254 --> 12:45.387
So you work and sleep
in here, then?

12:45.389 --> 12:47.190
Yes. When I first came home

12:47.192 --> 12:49.358
I couldn't be doing
with stairs.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.194
I actually prefer it now.

12:51.196 --> 12:53.496
Helps me keep on top
of things, you know.

12:53.498 --> 12:55.268
Difficult times for estates
like Hundreds.

12:57.168 --> 12:59.569
With death duties at 75%?

12:59.571 --> 13:02.071
I'll say. Labour government
won't be happy

13:02.073 --> 13:04.406
until we're begging for
our lives on street corners.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.443
Perhaps you feel the same way,
I don't know.

13:06.445 --> 13:07.580
Why would I?

13:09.114 --> 13:10.615
No.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.285
Do you mind?

13:17.990 --> 13:19.355
Anyway, I'm, uh,

13:19.357 --> 13:20.525
selling some land
to the council.

13:22.461 --> 13:24.026
Selling land?

13:24.028 --> 13:25.728
Just some scrub
behind the sheep sheds.

13:25.730 --> 13:27.629
Bring in some power and water
to the farm,

13:27.631 --> 13:29.968
make a big difference
to milking.

13:34.472 --> 13:35.772
Christ.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.109
Sit down, please.

13:39.211 --> 13:43.546
It's actually
a very gentle sensation.

13:43.548 --> 13:45.415
It might take away a little
of your pain.

13:45.417 --> 13:46.715
- Right.
- May I?

13:46.717 --> 13:49.486
Yes.

13:49.488 --> 13:54.093
I wouldn't bother, except I'm
just so slow about the place.

13:55.124 --> 13:57.160
Can't keep up with the men.

13:57.162 --> 13:58.494
Pretty foul, isn't it?

13:58.496 --> 13:59.631
I've seen worse.

14:16.114 --> 14:18.050
Not too bad, actually.

14:20.085 --> 14:22.221
Sort of hotting up.

14:23.288 --> 14:24.724
Huh.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.344
You're a wizard, Dr. Faraday.

14:48.346 --> 14:51.680
I really don't know how
to thank you.

14:51.682 --> 14:54.186
Well, perhaps you'd consider
this an act of restitution.

14:56.687 --> 14:59.823
A long time ago,
as a grubby-kneed boy,

14:59.825 --> 15:04.460
I snuck up and stole something
from this house.

15:04.462 --> 15:05.661
Really?

15:05.663 --> 15:08.297
One of your plaster acorns.

15:08.299 --> 15:10.266
Oh. Oh, but that's too funny.

15:10.268 --> 15:11.767
I don't know what came over me.

15:11.769 --> 15:13.236
I was such an obedient boy
as a rule.

15:13.238 --> 15:14.838
Oh, no, but Roddie and I

15:14.840 --> 15:18.608
have snapped off hundreds
of the silly, twiddly things.

15:18.610 --> 15:20.576
They were just asking
to be vandalized.

15:20.578 --> 15:22.377
I wasn't intending
to vandalize.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.147
I was overwhelmed
by admiration.

15:25.149 --> 15:26.882
Like a man stealing
a lock of hair

15:26.884 --> 15:28.818
from the girl he's fallen
blindly in love with.

15:28.820 --> 15:32.488
Mother almost died of shame
when she found out.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.390
- Did she make you own up?
- Heavens, no.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.658
She burned it in the grate.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.127
We never spoke of it again,

15:38.129 --> 15:39.796
but I don't think
she ever forgave me.

15:39.798 --> 15:41.330
Well, you're forgiven now.

15:41.332 --> 15:43.166
I forgive you.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.701
It is queer, isn't it?

15:45.703 --> 15:48.438
That you were here
before Rod and me.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.473
There was a child here then.

15:50.475 --> 15:52.208
Susan.

15:52.210 --> 15:54.143
<i>Susan died before I was born.</i>

15:54.145 --> 15:56.146
- <i>Yes.</i>
- Mummy.

15:56.148 --> 15:58.281
<i>I'm afraid I was
horribly jealous of her.</i>

15:58.283 --> 16:02.218
<i>She seemed to have such
a charmed existence.</i>

16:02.220 --> 16:03.652
<i>One can't see into the future.</i>

16:03.654 --> 16:05.320
<i>Don't worry, Doctor.</i>

16:05.322 --> 16:08.590
<i>We're all jealous of Suki,
not just you.</i>

16:10.528 --> 16:12.628
Swallow.

16:12.630 --> 16:15.567
They should be gone by now.

16:18.403 --> 16:20.603
Are you off back to Lidcote?

16:20.605 --> 16:23.839
I have a patient in Edgworth,
another in Hawthend.

16:23.841 --> 16:26.441
Why don't you cut across
and use the east gate?

16:26.443 --> 16:27.676
It's much quicker.

16:27.678 --> 16:28.844
Do you know the way?

16:28.846 --> 16:30.546
I think so.

16:30.548 --> 16:32.648
And, look, would it help
to use the park sometimes,

16:32.650 --> 16:35.120
as a shortcut?

16:36.354 --> 16:38.224
Thank you.

16:51.602 --> 16:53.435
<i>The treatment continued</i>

16:53.437 --> 16:55.537
<i>to yield results over
the weeks that followed,</i>

16:55.539 --> 16:59.508
<i>and a kind of relationship
developed with poor Rod.</i>

16:59.510 --> 17:01.911
<i>I saw at close hand how
utterly overwhelmed he was</i>

17:01.913 --> 17:03.613
<i>by the business
of running Hundreds.</i>

17:03.615 --> 17:08.317
<i>I couldn't help feeling
the house deserved better.</i>

17:08.319 --> 17:09.885
<i>And my heart went out
to Caroline,</i>

17:09.887 --> 17:12.821
<i>in many ways
so much more able,</i>

17:12.824 --> 17:15.458
<i>forced to watch
its continued decline.</i>

17:15.460 --> 17:18.460
<i>I resolved to help her
as much as I could.</i>

17:18.462 --> 17:20.596
Miss Ayres,
what brings you to town?

17:20.598 --> 17:21.930
Oh, Doctor.

17:21.932 --> 17:24.233
Well, uh, Rod and Mother

17:24.236 --> 17:26.635
are seeing the solicitor
about the land sale.

17:26.637 --> 17:28.003
Thought I'd come for the ride.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.706
You never know when I'll get
another chance.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.373
<i>So, when she asked</i>

17:31.375 --> 17:32.941
<i>if I would make up the numbers
at a small affair</i>

17:32.943 --> 17:34.811
- <i>to welcome new neighbors...</i>
- Oh, Caroline.

17:34.813 --> 17:36.912
- They've been invited over.
- Can we manage?

17:36.914 --> 17:38.815
Well, we'll have to, won't we?

17:38.817 --> 17:43.253
Oh, Doctor, you'll come, too,
won't you?

17:43.255 --> 17:44.519
<i>...it really did seem</i>

17:44.521 --> 17:45.890
<i>the least I could do.</i>

18:17.454 --> 18:19.424
Hello?

19:06.503 --> 19:07.870
Betty.

19:07.872 --> 19:10.573
Um, I'm sorry, Doctor.

19:10.575 --> 19:11.908
Let me help.

19:11.910 --> 19:13.976
Everything's jumpy tonight.

19:13.978 --> 19:17.283
Betty! Are you all right?

19:21.419 --> 19:23.052
Oh, Doctor.

19:23.054 --> 19:24.554
Welcome.

19:24.556 --> 19:26.756
Forgive me. I rang, but...

19:26.758 --> 19:29.424
Afraid I've been pinning
the house back together.

19:29.426 --> 19:31.427
So I see.

19:31.429 --> 19:33.429
My darling brother's
still in Lidcote,

19:33.431 --> 19:35.698
arguing with the builder
about the land sale.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.433
I do hope they're not drinking
to seal the deal.

19:38.435 --> 19:40.436
Ah, speaking of which,
help yourself.

19:40.438 --> 19:43.139
If there are any glasses left.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.740
Pay no attention.

19:44.742 --> 19:47.075
And I think
you look very smart, Betty.

19:47.077 --> 19:50.145
Oh, I should warn you...

19:50.147 --> 19:54.049
the acoustics
in this room are uncanny.

19:54.051 --> 19:56.988
Every word carries.

19:59.022 --> 20:02.493
You, Miss Ayres,
look beautiful.

20:04.561 --> 20:07.162
He hasn't touched
a drop yet, Gyp.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.900
Pour for me, too, would you?

20:10.902 --> 20:12.101
One would have hoped

20:12.103 --> 20:13.803
the weather
might have held off.

20:13.805 --> 20:15.571
Sadly, no.

20:15.573 --> 20:17.907
Mr. and Mrs. Rossiter

20:17.909 --> 20:19.741
- and Miss...
- Dabney.

20:19.743 --> 20:21.076
My dear.

20:21.078 --> 20:22.879
- How are you?
- Quite well.

20:22.881 --> 20:24.613
- Oh, Edith, you look wonderful.
- Nice to see you. Thank you.

20:24.615 --> 20:26.649
- Oh, Caroline.
- Hello, Edith, how nice to see you.

20:26.651 --> 20:28.116
Good evening. Nice to see you.

20:28.118 --> 20:29.852
Perhaps you know
our Dr. Faraday.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.653
- Good evening.
- Oh, I...

20:31.655 --> 20:33.055
I hope no one's unwell.

20:33.057 --> 20:35.792
Oh, no. The doctor is a guest.

20:35.794 --> 20:38.661
Ah. One of us.

20:38.663 --> 20:42.198
Will Roderick be joining us
this evening?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.199
Gillian!

20:47.105 --> 20:49.471
I hope no one minds.

20:49.473 --> 20:51.740
Darling, it's only a dog.

20:53.178 --> 20:55.114
This way, please.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.146
Mr. and Mrs. Baker-Hyde

20:58.148 --> 20:59.882
and Mr. Morley.

20:59.884 --> 21:03.652
Now behave.
You're not supposed to be here.

21:03.654 --> 21:04.853
- Good boy.
- Well, my mother grew up here,

21:04.855 --> 21:06.788
so I knew the area well
as a child.

21:06.790 --> 21:09.025
And, of course, my brother's
with us most weekends.

21:09.027 --> 21:10.692
Perhaps he should move up here.

21:10.694 --> 21:12.128
- If only I didn't have to work.
- Come back.

21:12.130 --> 21:14.729
What is it you do, Mr. Morley?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.731
I'm in the ad business.

21:16.733 --> 21:19.101
An accountant?

21:19.103 --> 21:20.902
No, advertising.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.572
It's an American outfit.

21:22.574 --> 21:25.208
Ah, America.

21:25.210 --> 21:27.008
- Hmm.
- Gyp, come here.

21:27.010 --> 21:28.878
Oh, gentlemen, please sit down.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.580
- Oh, thank you.
- Mr. Morley.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.614
Uh, uh, Dr. Faraday,

21:32.616 --> 21:35.617
would you be a lamb and see
if Roderick will join us?

21:35.619 --> 21:36.919
Of course.

21:38.722 --> 21:40.222
Have you come far this evening,
Miss Dabney?

21:40.224 --> 21:42.059
<i>Roderick.</i>

21:58.209 --> 22:00.679
Roderick.

22:08.219 --> 22:10.556
I'm not coming.

22:12.089 --> 22:14.759
Tell Mother I'm sorry.

22:18.061 --> 22:21.264
Look, Rod, put your drink down.

22:21.266 --> 22:22.931
Just get dressed.

22:22.933 --> 22:25.000
You're the man of the house.

22:25.002 --> 22:27.737
I've told you...

22:27.739 --> 22:29.738
I won't.

22:29.740 --> 22:32.044
- For God's sake...
- I can't.

22:34.244 --> 22:37.248
I've got a bad feeling,
Faraday.

22:39.317 --> 22:42.954
A very bad feeling.

22:44.188 --> 22:46.658
- Christ, don't you?
- Stop.

22:47.759 --> 22:48.958
Stop that nonsense.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.096
Stop it at once.

22:53.765 --> 22:56.034
Now get dressed.

22:58.903 --> 23:00.303
Have you traveled much?

23:00.305 --> 23:02.805
Well, I wanted to...

23:02.807 --> 23:06.142
Gyp, wait! Why won't he come
and play with me?

23:06.144 --> 23:08.276
He won't stay still.

23:08.278 --> 23:10.813
Well, perhaps
you should stay still.

23:10.815 --> 23:12.148
Gillian, darling.

23:12.150 --> 23:15.116
Goodness. Is that allowed?

23:15.118 --> 23:17.152
Well, I don't believe in rules

23:17.154 --> 23:18.353
just for the sake of them.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.155
Breeds all sorts of neuroses.

23:20.157 --> 23:21.958
You don't want them getting
a complex.

23:21.960 --> 23:24.192
- I never go to bed before midnight.
- Ah.

23:24.194 --> 23:27.228
And I once smoked a cigarette.

23:27.230 --> 23:30.165
I hardly think Dr.
Faraday would approve of that.

23:30.167 --> 23:33.169
No. But then my mother
was very hot on rules.

23:33.171 --> 23:35.604
And it hasn't done him
any harm.

23:35.606 --> 23:38.673
Gillian, look
at that beautiful piano.

23:38.675 --> 23:40.008
It's a spinet, you philistine.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.744
Actually,
it's a Flemish virginal.

23:41.746 --> 23:43.278
Do play us something, Tony.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.314
- Gyp.
- As long as it's not too old and fragile.

23:47.050 --> 23:48.817
Come on.

23:48.819 --> 23:51.319
- Let's see.
- See, we're friends now.

23:51.321 --> 23:54.690
Gillian, dear, please leave
that poor dog alone.

23:54.692 --> 23:57.192
Where is Roderick?

23:57.194 --> 24:00.328
He'll be,
he'll be with us shortly.

24:00.330 --> 24:03.332
He's rather overdone it
at the farm.

24:03.334 --> 24:05.934
Mm.

24:07.939 --> 24:09.171
What a lovely sound.

24:09.173 --> 24:11.407
It is, isn't it?
It's very light.

24:13.277 --> 24:14.977
Oh, that's it.

24:14.979 --> 24:16.715
- Good boy.
- Caroline used to love playing.

24:28.326 --> 24:30.092
He does play awfully well.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.192
Yes, he does.

24:31.194 --> 24:33.328
Such a gentle dog.

24:33.330 --> 24:36.699
I had no idea
the son was so bad.

24:36.701 --> 24:39.134
That why they keep you on hand?

24:39.136 --> 24:40.835
I'm a guest here, like you.

24:40.837 --> 24:42.738
Oh, no, pal.

24:42.740 --> 24:46.007
I'm just making up the numbers
while my wife and our hostess

24:46.009 --> 24:47.776
try matchmaking.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.745
I don't like their chances.

24:49.747 --> 24:52.213
Tony may be a prize ass,

24:52.215 --> 24:55.250
but he likes a pretty face.

25:03.027 --> 25:06.062
Gillian.

25:06.064 --> 25:07.763
What is it?

25:07.765 --> 25:09.097
Gillian!

25:09.099 --> 25:12.034
- Gyp, Gyp, come back.
- Gillian!

25:19.876 --> 25:21.309
You can't mean
to treat her here!

25:21.311 --> 25:23.344
It's nine miles
to the nearest hospital.

25:24.347 --> 25:25.448
Open the door.

25:25.450 --> 25:27.816
Open the door!

25:27.818 --> 25:29.351
Clear the table.

25:32.824 --> 25:34.856
It's all right.

25:34.858 --> 25:35.924
- Please.
- Hold her still.

25:35.926 --> 25:38.326
Betty, I need boiling water.

25:38.328 --> 25:39.862
- Hold her still.
- Please.

25:44.134 --> 25:46.035
Hold that there.
Hold that there.

25:46.037 --> 25:47.836
Shh, darling.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.271
- Shh.
- Mrs. Baker-Hyde might want to wait upstairs.

25:50.273 --> 25:51.774
No, I'm staying!

25:51.776 --> 25:53.109
Diana, do as he says.

25:53.111 --> 25:55.344
Diana... come on.

25:57.981 --> 26:00.818
Betty, make sure
they're getting blankets.

26:13.364 --> 26:14.997
Bloody dog should be shot.

26:14.999 --> 26:17.767
Shh.

26:45.163 --> 26:48.400
The child will be
terribly marked, won't she?

26:52.103 --> 26:55.470
I don't understand why
they had to bring her.

26:55.472 --> 26:59.275
Surely they have a nurse
or a governess.

26:59.277 --> 27:02.311
Probably think a governess
would give her a complex.

27:02.313 --> 27:04.212
Well, she'll have
a complex now, won't she?

27:04.214 --> 27:05.447
Oh, Caroline.

27:05.449 --> 27:08.086
Good night.

27:30.074 --> 27:33.042
I tried to tell you.

27:33.044 --> 27:35.046
Didn't I?

28:17.153 --> 28:19.990
Miss Caroline's downstairs.

28:29.366 --> 28:32.901
Came as soon
as you could, then.

28:32.903 --> 28:34.969
We might have taken this
to court, you know.

28:34.971 --> 28:36.671
I should have found
the money somehow.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.376
With the child so injured,
it wouldn't be decent.

28:44.915 --> 28:47.283
Take him.

28:47.285 --> 28:49.584
Everything else has gone.

28:49.586 --> 28:52.353
Why not take him, too?

28:52.355 --> 28:54.489
Caroline.

28:54.491 --> 28:56.424
Get away, you stupid dog.

28:56.426 --> 28:58.393
God.

29:14.010 --> 29:15.880
Shh.

29:17.548 --> 29:20.582
Shh.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.321
Good dog.

29:40.070 --> 29:41.636
Walk away, Faraday.

29:41.638 --> 29:45.009
Distance yourself
from the whole damn mess.

29:46.978 --> 29:50.245
Eh, the leg treatment
must be almost finished.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.046
Write up what you've
already done.

29:52.048 --> 29:53.550
Surely that's enough.

29:56.086 --> 29:58.453
Seriously.

29:58.455 --> 30:01.123
People like the Ayres...

30:01.125 --> 30:04.261
they'll run you bloody ragged
if you let them.

30:42.066 --> 30:44.333
Yes.

30:44.335 --> 30:47.568
The problem is your heart,
Mrs. Ravensdale.

30:47.570 --> 30:49.470
It's not doing
its job properly,

30:49.472 --> 30:51.239
and that's causing
the shortness of breath

30:51.241 --> 30:52.708
and the swelling.

30:52.710 --> 30:55.143
Couldn't be something
I've eaten?

30:55.145 --> 30:56.411
I'm afraid not.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.222
John.

31:08.592 --> 31:09.757
Mrs. Evans.

31:09.759 --> 31:11.826
Come through, please.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.566
Alfie, come on.

31:29.113 --> 31:30.578
Leave it.

31:30.580 --> 31:33.347
Leave it!

31:33.349 --> 31:34.783
Go on!

31:34.785 --> 31:36.584
Go on, I'll catch you up.

31:36.586 --> 31:37.786
He's had enough, hasn't he?

31:39.789 --> 31:42.557
Blasted thing.

31:42.559 --> 31:45.460
Please sit down.

31:45.462 --> 31:48.630
Thank you.

31:56.473 --> 31:58.407
So...

31:58.409 --> 32:00.345
Hmm.

32:04.481 --> 32:07.882
I just signed a contract
with Babb, you see.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.651
The land sale?

32:10.653 --> 32:12.653
That is good news.

32:12.655 --> 32:14.690
Yes.

32:14.692 --> 32:18.395
Yes, we ought to hang out
the flags.

32:19.896 --> 32:24.466
The men are cock-a-hoop,
of course.

32:24.468 --> 32:28.469
How are the mighty fallen, hey?

32:28.471 --> 32:31.672
Just think how much better
things will be now.

32:31.674 --> 32:32.644
Hmm.

32:34.845 --> 32:36.245
But they won't.

32:36.247 --> 32:38.713
Come on, I'm sure they will.

32:38.715 --> 32:43.651
Don't say that, Faraday.

32:43.653 --> 32:47.192
You don't know what
you're talking about.

32:50.193 --> 32:52.161
I should catch them up,
it's my round.

32:52.163 --> 32:53.495
You'd be surprised how much

32:53.497 --> 32:58.202
of my job is just listening
to people.

33:07.510 --> 33:09.314
- Hell.
- Rod.

33:11.648 --> 33:13.817
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

33:15.451 --> 33:18.953
I've been concerned about you.

33:18.955 --> 33:20.488
You wouldn't believe me.

33:20.490 --> 33:23.292
Of course I will.

33:23.294 --> 33:26.260
And I'm a doctor.

33:26.262 --> 33:28.596
Anything you tell me is
in the strictest confidence.

33:28.598 --> 33:31.135
There's a thing in that house.

33:33.537 --> 33:34.835
A thing?

33:34.837 --> 33:38.739
<i>It hates me.</i>

33:38.741 --> 33:41.776
<i>It always has.</i>

33:41.778 --> 33:44.412
<i>And ever since that awful night</i>

33:44.414 --> 33:46.850
<i>with the girl...</i>

33:49.819 --> 33:51.886
<i>Go on.</i>

33:51.888 --> 33:53.824
<i>It wants me gone.</i>

33:56.227 --> 33:58.163
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

34:02.900 --> 34:04.699
Dr. Faraday.

34:04.701 --> 34:05.734
Oh.

34:05.736 --> 34:07.702
Doctor.

34:07.704 --> 34:09.670
- Were we expecting you?
- Forgive me.

34:09.672 --> 34:12.373
I was visiting a patient
in the area.

34:12.376 --> 34:14.007
We've had a leak
in the morning room.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.876
Got in the cupboards.

34:15.878 --> 34:17.878
Oh, my brothers.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.014
Doctor, look.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.983
Within six months of this,
the fighting had started

34:21.985 --> 34:23.922
and they were lost.

34:38.936 --> 34:41.536
Suki.

34:41.538 --> 34:43.737
Like sweethearts, she and I.

34:43.739 --> 34:47.309
You're right to be touched
by this scene, Doctor.

34:47.311 --> 34:49.780
This was my little girl's
last happy day.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.849
By night she was already
quite ill.

34:53.851 --> 34:56.818
Mother.
I've boxed up some old books

34:56.820 --> 34:58.452
to give to the Red Cross.

34:58.454 --> 34:59.621
I wonder if Dr. Faraday
might take them

34:59.623 --> 35:00.722
to Lidcote in his car.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.923
Of course.

35:02.925 --> 35:05.295
Betty.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.300
I, uh...

35:11.302 --> 35:12.867
- I feel awkward coming.
- No, don't.

35:12.869 --> 35:15.369
I'm so glad you did.

35:15.371 --> 35:17.608
I've just seen Rod in Lidcote.

35:19.710 --> 35:22.077
Oh, God, is he in a bad way?

35:22.079 --> 35:24.545
I'm concerned about
his state of mind.

35:24.547 --> 35:26.483
You're not the only one.

35:30.887 --> 35:34.456
Last night he came up
to my room so upset.

35:34.458 --> 35:36.590
He said he could smell smoke,

35:36.592 --> 35:39.728
and I couldn't smell anything.

35:39.730 --> 35:41.028
It's like there's
a hoodoo on him.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.398
It's nothing like that.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.501
War shock.

35:47.438 --> 35:48.869
We must keep it from Mother.

35:48.871 --> 35:51.072
The land sale's already
too much to bear.

35:51.074 --> 35:52.441
I'm inclined to agree.

35:52.443 --> 35:53.641
God knows how she'll cope

35:53.643 --> 35:54.745
when Babb knocks down
the wall.

35:56.847 --> 35:58.780
Why on earth would Babb need
to knock down a wall?

35:58.782 --> 36:00.715
Well, they wouldn't take
the pasture.

36:00.717 --> 36:02.516
Didn't Rod say?

36:02.518 --> 36:04.519
They'd only take
the grass-snake field.

36:04.521 --> 36:07.555
Surely you can't mean
to break up the park?

36:07.557 --> 36:09.124
There must be some alternative.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.959
- Believe me, he tried.
- The sale must be stopped.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.429
- What?
- Rod's not of sound mind.

36:14.431 --> 36:15.699
- This can be overturned.
- Ah!

36:17.568 --> 36:19.570
Doctor.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.972
What's he been telling you?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.941
That I'm cracked?

36:26.943 --> 36:28.709
No. Of course not, Roddie.

36:28.711 --> 36:31.882
So much for confidentiality.

36:33.817 --> 36:37.786
Rod. Rod. I hadn't understood
about the land sale.

36:37.788 --> 36:39.920
Rod.

36:39.922 --> 36:42.724
- This is terribly serious.
- Damn right.

36:42.726 --> 36:45.059
The mob will be at our door
any moment.

36:45.061 --> 36:47.762
Cutlasses between their teeth.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.965
You ought not to worry, Doctor.

36:50.967 --> 36:53.869
You are from pirate stock.

36:53.871 --> 36:55.737
Rod.

36:56.739 --> 36:58.539
Oh, yes.

36:58.541 --> 37:01.142
There'll be tricks tonight.

37:01.144 --> 37:02.778
For God's sake,
look at yourself.

37:05.916 --> 37:08.853
You're afraid.

37:12.021 --> 37:14.856
You can feel it.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.090
Can't you?

37:16.092 --> 37:17.925
I'm sorry.

37:17.927 --> 37:19.760
Rod's in no fit state to be
making irrevocable decisions.

37:19.762 --> 37:21.429
You can feel it now?

37:21.431 --> 37:22.764
- You can feel it.
- I'm going to ask Dr. Granger

37:22.766 --> 37:24.432
- for a second opinion.
- Goddamn.

37:24.434 --> 37:27.635
Who the fucking hell are you?

37:27.637 --> 37:29.104
This is my house,

37:29.106 --> 37:31.440
and I'll do as I like
with the damn place!

37:31.442 --> 37:33.744
And it isn't any business
of yours!

37:35.478 --> 37:37.077
What are you doing here?

37:37.079 --> 37:40.615
You're not part of this family.

37:40.617 --> 37:43.617
You are no one.

37:43.619 --> 37:45.619
- Now get out!
- Rod, please don't.

37:45.621 --> 37:47.023
Get out of my house!

38:43.045 --> 38:44.880
<i>Please leave us.</i>

38:44.882 --> 38:47.883
<i>What do you want?</i>

38:52.789 --> 38:55.724
I've tried to warn them,
I've tried.

38:55.726 --> 38:57.057
They wouldn't listen to me,
please!

38:58.728 --> 39:00.295
You've got to leave!

39:00.297 --> 39:01.595
Just leave us, please!

39:01.597 --> 39:04.532
Betty. Betty!

39:04.534 --> 39:06.001
Roddie, open the door.
Roddie!

39:26.690 --> 39:28.826
I should never have
left him here last night.

39:32.061 --> 39:34.028
You placed your trust in me.

39:34.030 --> 39:35.632
I let you down.

39:37.568 --> 39:39.537
I shan't do so again.

40:06.797 --> 40:10.268
Rod, Dr. Warren's here.

40:15.606 --> 40:18.142
I'm sorry, Caroline.

40:20.677 --> 40:22.947
It's too strong for me.

40:25.181 --> 40:27.315
Rod.

40:37.360 --> 40:40.028
A trip in a Humber...
what a treat.

40:41.998 --> 40:43.898
That's good.

41:04.121 --> 41:06.320
There.

41:06.322 --> 41:07.988
Mrs. Ayres?

41:07.990 --> 41:09.923
Oh.

41:09.925 --> 41:12.159
I hope it's not too dry.

41:12.161 --> 41:13.762
Looks perfect.

41:13.764 --> 41:15.195
- Thank you.
- Caroline.

41:15.197 --> 41:17.335
It does seem a shame
Betty isn't here.

41:19.202 --> 41:22.202
But how nice for her father
to have her home for Christmas.

41:22.204 --> 41:23.641
Mm.

41:34.451 --> 41:36.954
Aren't you smart?

41:43.393 --> 41:47.061
Thanks for coming today.

41:47.063 --> 41:48.796
We'd have never survived
these last few months

41:48.798 --> 41:50.134
without you and Betty.

41:51.835 --> 41:54.702
Would have been a grim day
with Rod's chair empty.

41:54.704 --> 41:58.238
Christmas is generally grim
for aging bachelors.

41:58.240 --> 42:00.041
I was very glad
of an invitation

42:00.043 --> 42:02.110
- that didn't make me feel like a charity case.
- God, no.

42:02.112 --> 42:03.648
We're the charity case.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.780
You were looking
at the photograph?

42:06.782 --> 42:08.950
Mm.

42:08.952 --> 42:10.751
You know I'm in it?

42:10.753 --> 42:13.454
No.

42:13.456 --> 42:14.988
Oh, where?

42:15.992 --> 42:18.492
Where? Can't see you.

42:18.494 --> 42:21.463
That's the shoulder
of my jacket.

42:21.465 --> 42:23.097
<i>Oh. Ah.</i>

42:23.099 --> 42:25.200
<i>Upstaged by Susan.</i>

42:25.202 --> 42:26.501
Just like the rest of us.

42:26.503 --> 42:28.773
It was a grand day otherwise.

42:30.474 --> 42:32.474
Shall we have tea to warm up?

42:32.476 --> 42:35.746
Yes. And why don't I make it?

42:38.148 --> 42:40.284
You stay there.
Doctor's orders.

42:45.288 --> 42:47.287
<i>Tom!</i>

42:47.289 --> 42:49.759
Come inside.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.945
Sweetie.

43:10.947 --> 43:12.146
<i>The house itself was</i>

43:12.148 --> 43:13.914
<i>out of bounds, of course.</i>

43:13.916 --> 43:15.416
- ...wander off, do what you like.
- Elizabeth!

43:15.418 --> 43:17.418
<i>But as luck would have it,</i>

43:17.420 --> 43:20.220
<i>Mother still had friends
among the staff.</i>

43:20.222 --> 43:21.456
- How are you?
- <i>And so,</i>

43:21.458 --> 43:23.858
<i>miraculously, it came to pass.</i>

43:23.860 --> 43:25.996
<i>I was admitted.</i>

43:29.965 --> 43:33.034
<i>I'm afraid I was spoiled
thoroughly and given</i>

43:33.036 --> 43:35.336
<i>the most fantastic treats.</i>

43:35.338 --> 43:38.843
<i>It was any small boy's dream.</i>

43:41.545 --> 43:44.144
<i>It made me feel,
just for that moment,</i>

43:44.146 --> 43:48.182
<i>a part of the life
of the house.</i>

43:48.184 --> 43:50.184
<i>Perhaps that explains,</i>

43:50.186 --> 43:52.889
<i>to some degree, at least,
what happened next.</i>

44:42.905 --> 44:47.041
<i>My smart clothes that day
were all borrowed or begged,</i>

44:47.043 --> 44:52.280
<i>but there, in that grand hall
filled with marvelous things...</i>

44:52.282 --> 44:55.251
<i>I could not help imagining
that I belonged.</i>

44:56.552 --> 44:59.088
<i>A proper little gentleman.</i>

45:12.434 --> 45:15.371
<i>Course, I was no such thing.</i>

45:45.668 --> 45:47.570
<i>What are you doing there?</i>

45:55.445 --> 45:57.445
Get over here!

45:57.447 --> 45:59.380
What are you doing?

45:59.382 --> 46:01.182
<i>I left behind</i>

46:01.184 --> 46:03.217
<i>all such ambitions that day.</i>

46:05.487 --> 46:07.487
I don't want to hear
a word out of you.

46:07.489 --> 46:09.990
Come with me right now.

46:09.992 --> 46:12.260
<i>Funny. A small thing</i>

46:12.262 --> 46:14.595
<i>so many years ago.</i>

46:16.166 --> 46:19.169
Yet the memory's quite fresh.

46:29.713 --> 46:32.412
<i>Sit up, please,</i>

46:32.414 --> 46:34.349
Alan.

46:34.351 --> 46:35.749
Hmm?

46:35.751 --> 46:37.418
Chin up.

46:37.420 --> 46:42.059
Now let's see if there's been
any improvement.

46:44.393 --> 46:46.462
Open if you can.

46:47.697 --> 46:49.365
Open.

46:51.134 --> 46:53.938
Can you see who it is, Alan?

46:56.072 --> 46:58.139
Well, well, well.

46:58.141 --> 47:00.141
How wonderful.

47:00.143 --> 47:03.177
- Thank you.
- Good.

47:13.155 --> 47:15.389
Good Lord.

47:15.391 --> 47:17.691
24 houses in both fields,

47:17.693 --> 47:20.293
most of them
already spoken for.

47:20.295 --> 47:22.597
- What a terrible shame.
- Oh.

47:22.599 --> 47:24.264
I don't know.

47:24.266 --> 47:26.434
- People have to live somewhere.
- Dr. Faraday?

47:26.436 --> 47:28.135
- Ah.
- Mr. Babb.

47:28.137 --> 47:29.771
I knew you'd be down,
Miss Ayres.

47:29.773 --> 47:31.606
Every day like clockwork.

47:31.608 --> 47:33.608
She puts my foreman to shame.

47:33.610 --> 47:36.043
I've promised Dr. Faraday
the tour.

47:36.045 --> 47:38.612
Right, well, come on, then.

47:38.614 --> 47:42.282
So, uh... a lounge.

47:42.284 --> 47:44.418
- Hmm.
- Fitted kitchen.

47:44.420 --> 47:46.454
Gas stove, electric points.

47:46.456 --> 47:48.822
Bathroom with a built-in tub.

47:48.824 --> 47:51.525
Gosh. Think what a difference
this would make to people.

47:51.527 --> 47:52.726
There'll be nothing
to beat these

47:52.728 --> 47:54.729
in the way of air and drainage.

47:54.731 --> 47:56.798
You're right about the houses.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.367
My mother would have liked one.

48:00.369 --> 48:02.103
She might be alive
and living in one

48:02.105 --> 48:03.804
if she hadn't worked herself
into an early grave

48:03.806 --> 48:05.773
to get me an education.

48:05.775 --> 48:07.775
I'm sure
she was very proud of you.

48:07.777 --> 48:09.510
Your father, too.

48:09.512 --> 48:11.749
All I learned was
to be ashamed of them.

48:14.117 --> 48:16.684
God, what an utter
wet blanket I'm being.

48:16.686 --> 48:18.586
You must be wishing
I hadn't called by.

48:18.588 --> 48:20.387
No, not at all.

48:20.389 --> 48:22.856
I'm grateful.

48:22.858 --> 48:24.758
It gets so lonely sometimes
without Roddie.

48:24.760 --> 48:27.095
These short days don't help.

48:27.097 --> 48:29.162
They just make me want
to get out.

48:29.164 --> 48:31.132
- Out where?
- Yeah, well, I'm not fussy.

48:31.134 --> 48:34.434
You know, just to be
where people are for a while.

48:34.436 --> 48:37.273
When you say
you're not fussy...?

48:53.856 --> 48:56.624
Right. I want all the scandal.

48:56.626 --> 48:58.793
Who's killed the most patients,

48:58.795 --> 49:01.394
which doctors are going
to bed with which nurses.

49:01.396 --> 49:03.231
- Faraday.
- Ah, Bland.

49:03.233 --> 49:06.333
You can't be thinking of taking
that down unadulterated.

49:06.335 --> 49:08.469
Here.

49:08.471 --> 49:11.873
Fresh from the test tube.

49:11.875 --> 49:13.541
- No... -I don't...
- Ah.

49:13.543 --> 49:15.876
Hmm.

49:15.878 --> 49:18.347
Cheers.

49:21.483 --> 49:23.351
Ah, Faraday,

49:23.353 --> 49:24.552
well done
on that paper of yours.

49:24.554 --> 49:26.887
Hope it goes down well
in London.

49:26.889 --> 49:29.423
Thank you, Hewitt.
That's kind of you.

49:29.425 --> 49:31.592
Goodness, you're quite
the somebody.

49:31.594 --> 49:33.927
- London?
- Not at all.

49:33.929 --> 49:36.530
And I haven't even accepted
the invitation yet.

49:36.532 --> 49:38.699
Gosh, why wouldn't you?

49:40.335 --> 49:42.403
Come on, let's find you
someone to dance with.

49:42.405 --> 49:43.637
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

49:43.639 --> 49:45.673
They'll all be longing
for a turn

49:45.675 --> 49:47.478
with some pretty young nurse.

49:48.911 --> 49:52.246
You and I can dance, can't we?

49:52.248 --> 49:54.518
Mm-hmm.

50:01.224 --> 50:03.925
I suddenly feel nervous.

50:03.927 --> 50:05.863
Close your eyes.

50:11.534 --> 50:13.700
- Oh, you dance very well.
- You, too.

50:13.702 --> 50:16.403
My father taught me
when I was small.

50:16.405 --> 50:18.438
Am I talking too much?

50:18.440 --> 50:20.374
Talk all you like.

50:22.612 --> 50:24.612
What are you grinning about?

50:24.614 --> 50:26.581
You look like a dancer in a contest.

50:26.583 --> 50:28.851
Have they pinned a number
to your back?

50:31.621 --> 50:33.554
Ooh, there's Dr. Seeley.

50:33.556 --> 50:35.255
Look at his bow tie.

50:35.257 --> 50:36.958
Whiz me around so you can
take a look.

50:36.960 --> 50:40.961
Do you know
he's nicknamed The Octopus?

50:40.963 --> 50:43.798
Always terribly keen
to give girls a lift home.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.736
Hands everywhere.

51:02.885 --> 51:04.818
Faraday!

51:04.820 --> 51:07.320
Ah, Caroline,
you know, uh, David Granger.

51:07.322 --> 51:08.722
- Oh, yes.
- Hello.

51:08.724 --> 51:10.258
- And this is Anne Gra... yeah.
- Anne Granger.

51:10.260 --> 51:11.626
- Caroline Ayres.
- Lovely to meet you.

51:11.628 --> 51:13.594
- You, too.
- Oh, let me introduce our friend

51:13.596 --> 51:14.996
- Bre...
- Brenda?

51:14.998 --> 51:16.664
- Oh.
- I can't believe it.

51:19.402 --> 51:21.469
Oh, gosh, Brenda and I knew
each other years ago.

51:21.471 --> 51:23.470
Back in the war. How are you?

51:23.472 --> 51:25.505
No introduction required.

51:41.523 --> 51:43.724
Good to see Caroline
out and about.

51:43.726 --> 51:45.963
She's a super girl.

51:50.766 --> 51:52.633
Ladies and gentlemen,

51:52.635 --> 51:56.537
please take the floor
for Paul Jones.

51:56.539 --> 51:57.972
- Shall we?
- Now don't be shy.

51:57.974 --> 52:00.041
- Here's your chance to join her. Come on.
- No.

52:00.043 --> 52:01.575
- Come on, Faraday.
- No.

52:01.577 --> 52:03.577
- In for a penny.
- All right.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.515
Ladies on the outside.

52:07.416 --> 52:10.351
- Oh.
- Gosh, hello.

52:16.059 --> 52:18.458
This is murder!

52:18.460 --> 52:19.729
Oh!

52:21.063 --> 52:22.662
Oh.

52:22.664 --> 52:24.764
Oh, it is.
Hello, Seeley. How are you?

52:24.766 --> 52:26.766
- Looking as pretty as a picture.
- Thank you.

52:26.768 --> 52:28.601
Here we go.

52:31.474 --> 52:33.010
Hey! Hey!

52:49.891 --> 52:51.391
Hey! Hey!

53:02.972 --> 53:06.740
Nights like this,
I feel my age.

53:06.742 --> 53:08.909
Good dancer, Caroline Ayres.

53:08.911 --> 53:11.945
She's got hips and she knows
what to do with them.

53:11.947 --> 53:14.382
Pity she hasn't the looks
to match.

53:14.384 --> 53:16.583
Don't let that stop you.

53:16.585 --> 53:19.086
Girl like that
needs an outlet.

53:19.088 --> 53:20.954
Oh, come on.

53:20.956 --> 53:24.760
Everyone knows how much time
you've been spending out there.

53:26.628 --> 53:28.963
Do they indeed?

53:28.965 --> 53:33.166
I'm telling you, Faraday,
make your move tonight before

53:33.168 --> 53:35.739
that fool in the horn-rimmed
glasses makes his.

53:36.838 --> 53:38.671
Valerie, darling.

53:38.673 --> 53:40.106
- Seeley, I heard you were here.
- Have you been ignoring me?

53:40.108 --> 53:41.644
Now, you promised me...

53:48.885 --> 53:51.418
Shall I light you one?

53:51.420 --> 53:53.987
- I can light my own.
- Oh, come on.

53:53.989 --> 53:58.094
Let me...
like they do in the pictures.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.706
No, no, no.
Hands on the wheel.

54:13.708 --> 54:15.878
It's icy, remember?

54:23.952 --> 54:26.887
There.

54:26.889 --> 54:28.956
Don't much like Brenda.

54:28.958 --> 54:31.061
I'd never have guessed.

54:33.128 --> 54:35.595
Think she thought
you and I were at it.

54:35.597 --> 54:37.534
You know.

54:38.601 --> 54:40.170
Hope you put her swiftly right.

54:46.476 --> 54:49.142
Did you?

54:49.144 --> 54:51.148
I told her the truth.

54:53.181 --> 54:55.584
A friend of the family
being kind.

54:58.688 --> 55:01.021
God.

55:01.023 --> 55:04.661
My feet are perished. Ugh.

55:23.846 --> 55:25.548
Oh, gosh.

55:26.648 --> 55:28.784
It's not long now.

55:29.885 --> 55:31.822
I don't want to go home.

55:33.655 --> 55:35.789
Take me somewhere else,
can't you?

55:35.791 --> 55:39.126
- It's past 2:00.
- Care for a walk?

55:39.128 --> 55:41.161
In dancing shoes?

55:41.163 --> 55:43.162
Please, Faraday,

55:43.164 --> 55:46.001
I don't want to go home yet.

56:57.974 --> 56:59.206
Oh, my God.

57:13.322 --> 57:15.289
- Mmm.
- Sorry. Sorry. Can't, can't.

57:15.291 --> 57:16.724
No, can't! Can't! Can't!

57:16.726 --> 57:18.057
God's sake.

57:18.059 --> 57:19.760
I thought you wanted to.

57:19.762 --> 57:21.729
So did I. I can't.

57:21.731 --> 57:23.030
Wait.

57:23.032 --> 57:24.365
Caroline, please,
Caroline, wait.

57:35.978 --> 57:38.811
<i>After approximately 15 minutes</i>

57:38.813 --> 57:41.347
<i>of the current being applied
to the leg,</i>

57:41.349 --> 57:44.284
the patient's pulse rate rose,
as had been anticipated,

57:44.286 --> 57:47.153
and there was a slight fall
in blood pressure.

57:47.155 --> 57:50.023
There was no pain associated
with the procedure,

57:50.025 --> 57:52.059
and afterwards
a marked increase

57:52.061 --> 57:54.394
in general mobility
of the joint was observed.

57:54.396 --> 57:57.063
Positive effects diminished
over time.

57:57.065 --> 57:59.766
Yes, we've got some really
interesting work here.

57:59.768 --> 58:01.834
You should think
about staying on.

58:01.836 --> 58:03.936
I'm flattered
they asked, but...

58:03.938 --> 58:06.940
Mmm. So, where did you train?

58:06.942 --> 58:09.776
Up in Birmingham.
Stayed on there for a while.

58:09.778 --> 58:11.679
Then got seconded
to a military hospital

58:11.681 --> 58:13.347
in Plymouth
after we pulled out of Dieppe.

58:13.349 --> 58:16.050
- Must have been busy.
- Hellish.

58:16.052 --> 58:18.952
I'm at a practice
in Warwickshire now.

58:18.954 --> 58:20.420
It's a backwater, really.

58:20.422 --> 58:22.923
Cheers.

58:22.925 --> 58:26.092
So, uh, are you
a family man, or...?

58:26.094 --> 58:27.894
No.

58:27.896 --> 58:31.898
Well, for heaven's sake,
move to London.

58:31.900 --> 58:34.767
What's stopping you?
Charles, don't you think

58:34.769 --> 58:36.302
Faraday should move to London?

58:36.304 --> 58:38.104
I think it's a fine idea, yeah.

58:47.115 --> 58:48.449
Yes?

58:49.985 --> 58:51.719
Welcome back.

58:51.721 --> 58:53.287
Is everything all right?

58:53.289 --> 58:55.956
Absolutely. Just...

58:55.958 --> 58:57.925
curious about how it went.

58:57.927 --> 58:59.425
The bright lights, all that?

58:59.427 --> 59:02.766
Yes. Interesting.

59:03.998 --> 59:06.133
Sorry.

59:06.135 --> 59:09.436
Rather a difficult
first day back.

59:09.438 --> 59:12.206
13-year-old over in Illescote,
pregnant

59:12.208 --> 59:14.208
till the father beat it out
of her.

59:14.210 --> 59:15.809
Oh, God, grim.

59:15.811 --> 59:17.311
Sorry, Faraday.

59:17.313 --> 59:19.345
One feels so useless.

59:19.347 --> 59:20.947
Rather wonder why
I bothered coming back.

59:20.949 --> 59:22.449
Oh, don't say that.

59:22.451 --> 59:24.887
I missed you.

59:28.389 --> 59:32.860
And... Caroline called
a couple of days ago.

59:32.862 --> 59:34.927
Mrs. Ayres had some kind of...

59:34.929 --> 59:37.264
well... turn.

59:37.266 --> 59:39.766
They weren't
awfully forthcoming about it.

59:39.768 --> 59:42.469
I couldn't find much wrong
with her.

59:42.471 --> 59:44.237
You went to Hundreds?

59:44.239 --> 59:47.074
I did.

59:47.076 --> 59:49.543
<i>I tell you,
I couldn't leave fast enough.</i>

59:49.545 --> 59:52.445
<i>I feel for Caroline,
stuck out there.</i>

59:54.048 --> 59:56.418
<i>She's the best of the bunch
by a mile.</i>

01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:15.536
- Doctor, I want...
- Miss Ayres.

01:00:15.538 --> 01:00:18.074
Can we please start again?

01:00:26.181 --> 01:00:29.349
So tell me what happened.

01:00:29.351 --> 01:00:32.318
Don't really know.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.289
I feel silly now.

01:00:41.063 --> 01:00:43.197
We don't come in here often.

01:00:43.199 --> 01:00:46.400
You know, not anymore.

01:00:46.402 --> 01:00:49.403
But we were checking for leaks
and we heard a...

01:00:49.405 --> 01:00:53.276
It sounds stupid, but we heard
a sort of knocking sound.

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.347
Down there.

01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:03.916
We found these marks.

01:01:03.918 --> 01:01:05.452
You know, I thought

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:08.155
it must've been
that little girl at first.

01:01:08.157 --> 01:01:10.927
But Betty cleaned up,
you know, after...

01:01:12.193 --> 01:01:15.264
She would have noticed.

01:01:17.398 --> 01:01:19.335
They won't come off.

01:01:24.606 --> 01:01:27.374
Well, that's not all.

01:01:27.376 --> 01:01:30.644
Mother was woken
by something in the night.

01:01:30.646 --> 01:01:33.380
She thought a bird had got in.

01:01:33.382 --> 01:01:35.481
She called Betty,
and they searched

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:37.483
her dressing room for it.

01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:39.385
Well, I love this one.

01:01:39.387 --> 01:01:41.354
That was my favorite

01:01:41.356 --> 01:01:42.456
when I was your age.

01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:43.590
Go on, try it.

01:01:43.592 --> 01:01:45.425
Okay.

01:01:46.427 --> 01:01:49.162
Oh, Dr. Faraday. Look at us.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:51.565
Wait. Now.

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:52.999
Betty.

01:01:53.001 --> 01:01:54.934
- Come on.
- Oh, madam, shall I?

01:01:54.936 --> 01:01:57.304
The doctor disapproves

01:01:57.306 --> 01:01:59.238
of our frivolity.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.974
I'm happy
to see you looking so well.

01:02:01.976 --> 01:02:04.278
Caroline told me
you'd been unsettled.

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.282
Ah, you mean
after my discovery.

01:02:08.983 --> 01:02:10.987
Might I see?

01:03:14.416 --> 01:03:15.184
Suki.

01:03:17.719 --> 01:03:19.619
After all this time,
I didn't suppose

01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:22.291
there was much trace
of her left.

01:03:39.108 --> 01:03:41.541
Your mother's heart rate's
a little elevated.

01:03:41.543 --> 01:03:44.276
It's hardly surprising.
Otherwise,

01:03:44.278 --> 01:03:47.380
- she's in perfect health.
- Oh, for God's sake, Faraday.

01:03:47.382 --> 01:03:50.217
Right. Shall I explain

01:03:50.219 --> 01:03:51.784
what happened?

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:55.655
Look... the marks downstairs

01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:58.492
you found by accident, yes?

01:03:58.494 --> 01:04:00.459
But they triggered
a buried memory

01:04:00.461 --> 01:04:02.595
for your mother,
so she remembered the others.

01:04:02.597 --> 01:04:04.363
And the new marks today?

01:04:04.365 --> 01:04:06.800
They're not new.

01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:09.469
Those marks,
whilst disturbing...

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:10.771
even I felt that...

01:04:10.773 --> 01:04:12.472
they're nothing more
than they appear.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.141
And what about
the knocking sound?

01:04:14.143 --> 01:04:15.809
It's the heating pipes,
I imagine.

01:04:15.811 --> 01:04:17.344
No, we haven't had
the heating on

01:04:17.346 --> 01:04:18.545
- for months.
- Then the pipes contracting

01:04:18.547 --> 01:04:20.483
in the cold.

01:04:22.583 --> 01:04:26.420
Caroline, you mustn't let
this business get inside you.

01:04:26.422 --> 01:04:29.625
It can all be explained.

01:04:35.097 --> 01:04:38.097
Faraday...

01:04:38.099 --> 01:04:41.036
I'm so glad you're here.

01:04:42.471 --> 01:04:45.574
When I'm alone,
I can't tell anymore.

01:04:48.143 --> 01:04:51.478
Whenever you go away,
something horrible happens.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.050
Dear girl.

01:04:58.152 --> 01:05:00.086
There's some talk

01:05:00.088 --> 01:05:03.423
of my going back permanently.

01:05:03.425 --> 01:05:05.425
To live in London?

01:05:05.427 --> 01:05:07.760
I should have to think about
what I was leaving behind.

01:05:07.762 --> 01:05:09.563
Not much.

01:05:09.565 --> 01:05:11.498
Lidcote would seem like
a bad dream in no time.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.635
I meant in terms of you and me.

01:05:16.737 --> 01:05:20.240
Well, look, Faraday,
that time in the car, I...

01:05:20.242 --> 01:05:21.508
I behaved like a fool.

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:23.209
- I was the fool.
- No.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:25.412
Caroline, I've-I've missed you.

01:05:25.414 --> 01:05:27.347
I've missed you like hell.

01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:29.148
God.

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:32.251
What a bloody idiot
you've made of me.

01:05:32.253 --> 01:05:35.255
I shouldn't have left you.

01:05:35.257 --> 01:05:36.659
I won't do it again.

01:05:42.164 --> 01:05:45.632
Look...

01:05:45.634 --> 01:05:48.371
you perfect child.

01:05:50.438 --> 01:05:51.604
Be no more
of this sort of thing,

01:05:51.606 --> 01:05:52.771
you know, once we're married.

01:05:52.773 --> 01:05:54.673
- You're not a skivvy.
- Faraday, what...?

01:05:54.675 --> 01:05:57.711
Just say yes, Caroline.

01:05:57.713 --> 01:06:00.479
Just say yes.

01:06:00.481 --> 01:06:02.182
Hmm?

01:06:02.184 --> 01:06:05.321
What this house needs is
a big dose of happiness.

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:19.266
Oh.

01:06:19.268 --> 01:06:21.200
It's done.

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:23.806
Hmm.

01:06:40.188 --> 01:06:41.554
We haven't
announced it formally yet

01:06:41.556 --> 01:06:43.255
because Caroline's shy.

01:06:43.257 --> 01:06:45.559
And there's the question
of Mrs. Ayres.

01:06:45.561 --> 01:06:47.327
Have you told her?

01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:48.528
We didn't want to worry her

01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:50.229
before we'd clarified
our plans.

01:06:50.231 --> 01:06:52.666
Do you think she'll approve?

01:06:52.668 --> 01:06:55.202
I think she'll be delighted.

01:06:55.204 --> 01:06:57.503
Well, it's terrific news.

01:06:57.505 --> 01:06:59.639
Congratulations.

01:07:23.864 --> 01:07:25.731
What are you up to?

01:07:25.733 --> 01:07:28.635
Writing to Roderick.

01:07:28.637 --> 01:07:32.539
Have you told him about us?

01:07:33.942 --> 01:07:36.344
Betty could come in any moment.

01:07:39.414 --> 01:07:42.315
She'll have to get used
to catching us kissing.

01:07:42.317 --> 01:07:44.316
She'll be bringing us
eggs and bacon in bed

01:07:44.318 --> 01:07:45.952
in the mornings.

01:07:45.954 --> 01:07:48.755
But if we were married,
we wouldn't be here.

01:07:48.757 --> 01:07:51.724
You wouldn't rather live
above the surgery?

01:07:51.726 --> 01:07:54.661
We can hardly abandon
your mother.

01:07:54.663 --> 01:07:58.565
You can't think she'll
accept us living with her?

01:07:58.567 --> 01:08:01.300
- In any case, what about London?
- London?

01:08:01.302 --> 01:08:04.271
I turned down the position
to stay here with you.

01:08:04.273 --> 01:08:05.871
You never said you did that.

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:07.840
I thought it was obvious. Look,

01:08:07.842 --> 01:08:09.541
don't worry about your mother.

01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:10.809
She'll come around.

01:08:10.811 --> 01:08:12.679
- She won't.
- She will.

01:08:12.681 --> 01:08:13.880
She'll have to.

01:08:15.884 --> 01:08:17.783
Betty, what are you doing here?

01:08:17.786 --> 01:08:19.852
Well, you rang for me, miss.

01:08:19.854 --> 01:08:21.020
I did not.

01:08:21.023 --> 01:08:22.388
It must have been Mother.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:23.990
Well, Mrs. Ayres is upstairs.

01:08:23.992 --> 01:08:25.658
It was this bell that rung.

01:08:25.661 --> 01:08:27.727
Rang itself, did it?

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:29.728
Well, I don't know, but...

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:32.234
Go and see what she wants.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.734
Oh, and by the way,

01:08:35.737 --> 01:08:37.471
all the water's gone brown.

01:08:39.841 --> 01:08:42.741
Babb must have hit a pipe.

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:46.679
You have it your way...
for now.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.684
I'll go and check on Babb.

01:09:07.469 --> 01:09:09.803
Told you.

01:09:09.805 --> 01:09:12.104
Dining room. See?

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:16.076
Mother might have woken up.

01:09:16.078 --> 01:09:17.810
Go and see
if she needs anything, hmm?

01:09:19.346 --> 01:09:21.684
Betty?

01:09:23.652 --> 01:09:25.587
That was Mother's bedroom.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.907
Oh, damn it, come on.

01:09:53.948 --> 01:09:55.382
Mice.

01:09:57.452 --> 01:09:59.119
What's all this noise?

01:09:59.121 --> 01:10:00.719
Mice.

01:10:00.721 --> 01:10:02.589
There's some poison
at the farm.

01:10:02.591 --> 01:10:04.360
I'll run and get some.

01:10:08.596 --> 01:10:10.062
Nursery.

01:10:10.064 --> 01:10:11.900
It's just them mice, madam.

01:10:23.612 --> 01:10:25.611
Come.

01:10:25.613 --> 01:10:28.049
Come. Come listen.

01:10:39.927 --> 01:10:41.896
What do you hear?

01:10:46.134 --> 01:10:48.069
I don't know.

01:10:51.939 --> 01:10:53.940
We must check upstairs.

01:10:53.942 --> 01:10:57.043
Well, let's wait
for Miss Caroline.

01:10:58.145 --> 01:11:00.782
Madam, wait.

01:11:10.792 --> 01:11:12.157
Please, let's wait
for Miss Caroline.

01:11:12.159 --> 01:11:13.726
You stay if you like.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:16.698
What have I to fear
in a nursery?

01:11:47.662 --> 01:11:49.899
Susan?

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:54.036
Susan?

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:10.786
Betty?

01:12:11.886 --> 01:12:13.519
Betty?!

01:12:13.521 --> 01:12:15.921
Betty!

01:12:18.025 --> 01:12:20.192
Betty, unlock the door.

01:12:21.729 --> 01:12:23.963
Betty, unlock...

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.831
the door!

01:12:25.833 --> 01:12:28.268
Betty.

01:12:56.564 --> 01:12:58.298
Caroline!

01:14:25.386 --> 01:14:27.387
Rod was right.

01:14:27.389 --> 01:14:30.055
There's something
in this house that hates us.

01:14:30.057 --> 01:14:32.090
That's nonsense, Caroline.

01:14:32.092 --> 01:14:36.062
No, we're so changed...
from even a year ago.

01:14:36.064 --> 01:14:39.031
I knew this house
had summat bad.

01:14:39.033 --> 01:14:41.433
We told you.

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:43.803
When did you tell him?

01:14:43.805 --> 01:14:47.440
First time I felt it.

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:49.942
Mrs. Ayres believes me.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:52.210
- You told Mrs. Ayres?
- She said it was a ghost

01:14:52.212 --> 01:14:54.813
and not to worry.
It wouldn't do no harm.

01:14:54.815 --> 01:14:56.982
No harm?

01:14:56.984 --> 01:15:00.352
Does this look like no harm
to you, Betty?

01:15:00.354 --> 01:15:03.121
No one's blaming you, Betty.

01:15:03.123 --> 01:15:05.327
You've been very brave.

01:15:08.863 --> 01:15:10.862
We failed her.

01:15:10.864 --> 01:15:13.268
- Shh.
- My beautiful girl.

01:15:15.069 --> 01:15:17.335
I wanted her so desperately.

01:15:17.337 --> 01:15:21.374
But when she came...
I was afraid.

01:15:21.376 --> 01:15:23.742
Mrs. Ayres,
your mind is playing tricks.

01:15:23.744 --> 01:15:25.777
You need to rest.

01:15:25.779 --> 01:15:29.281
- I'm not an invalid.
- I'm the doctor here.

01:15:29.283 --> 01:15:31.983
You must allow me to decide
who the invalids are.

01:15:31.985 --> 01:15:35.187
And you must remember
whose house this is.

01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:38.760
Stop. Stop, please.

01:15:43.363 --> 01:15:47.001
I'm so sorry, Mama.

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:52.675
What have you to be sorry for?

01:16:06.921 --> 01:16:09.021
Difficult job?

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:11.022
Seeley.

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:13.125
Routine tonsillectomy.

01:16:13.127 --> 01:16:15.096
I made a pig's ear of it.

01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:18.764
Yes, well,
it's too many night calls.

01:16:18.766 --> 01:16:20.767
I know the feeling.

01:16:20.769 --> 01:16:24.039
Are you finished for the day?

01:16:27.509 --> 01:16:30.143
I just feel
things are out of control.

01:16:30.145 --> 01:16:34.246
This business seems
almost contagious.

01:16:34.248 --> 01:16:38.017
I was medical officer
at a girls' school for a while.

01:16:38.019 --> 01:16:40.553
One time there was
this fashion for fainting.

01:16:40.555 --> 01:16:43.156
Girls going down like ninepins.

01:16:43.158 --> 01:16:44.824
Eventually
their mistresses, too.

01:16:44.826 --> 01:16:46.259
That's just it.

01:16:46.261 --> 01:16:48.197
I don't know where it will end.

01:16:49.530 --> 01:16:51.531
Caroline has begun to believe

01:16:51.533 --> 01:16:53.465
there's something supernatural
involved.

01:16:53.467 --> 01:16:55.535
- -Some malevolent
force in the house.

01:16:55.537 --> 01:16:59.007
And it's madness,
I know, but...

01:17:01.376 --> 01:17:03.412
I'm beginning to wonder myself.

01:17:05.145 --> 01:17:07.782
What exactly are you saying?

01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:11.918
We all subscribe
to the general principle

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:13.352
of a conscious personality

01:17:13.354 --> 01:17:17.156
<i>with a sort
of dream self attached.</i>

01:17:17.158 --> 01:17:19.558
<i>You're suggesting</i>

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:22.061
<i>this subconscious self
could somehow...?</i>

01:17:22.063 --> 01:17:27.433
<i>Detach
under sufficient pressure.</i>

01:17:27.435 --> 01:17:29.235
<i>Become mischievous or malign.</i>

01:17:29.237 --> 01:17:31.937
<i>Acting out
all the nasty impulses</i>

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:33.505
<i>the conscious mind
wants hidden?</i>

01:17:46.988 --> 01:17:49.088
Isn't that the old theory

01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:51.456
of the poltergeist?

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:53.226
Oh, God.

01:17:53.228 --> 01:17:55.227
Then there isn't an ounce
of science in it.

01:17:55.229 --> 01:17:57.028
Oh, no, no. Not so fast.

01:17:57.030 --> 01:18:00.199
- You might be on to something.
- Hmm?

01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:03.369
What if science has yet to find
a way to measure such things?

01:18:03.371 --> 01:18:06.138
Look at my fainting females.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:10.579
It is generally women at the
root of this stuff, of course.

01:18:13.614 --> 01:18:15.548
Don't they have
some young housemaid

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:19.151
stuck out at Hundreds,
no one to flirt with?

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:21.553
Betty's a child still.

01:18:21.555 --> 01:18:25.226
Mmm, and children are capable
of the most intense desire.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:34.933
Thank you for walking me.

01:18:34.935 --> 01:18:37.003
I'm very much enjoying it.

01:18:37.005 --> 01:18:38.336
You know I'm never left alone.

01:18:38.338 --> 01:18:40.205
I suppose
that's on your orders.

01:18:40.207 --> 01:18:43.075
Hmm. No matter.

01:18:43.077 --> 01:18:45.076
I have something I want to say

01:18:45.078 --> 01:18:48.246
before Caroline gets back.

01:18:48.248 --> 01:18:51.116
You must take her away
from here.

01:18:51.118 --> 01:18:53.518
- I shall do no such thing.
- Yes.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.621
Leave Susan and me
alone together.

01:18:56.623 --> 01:18:59.157
Susan is a memory.
We've agreed that, haven't we?

01:18:59.159 --> 01:19:01.363
How innocent you are.

01:19:02.497 --> 01:19:05.063
She's with me all the time.

01:19:05.065 --> 01:19:08.034
She's here with me now.

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:09.434
Please stop this.

01:19:09.436 --> 01:19:12.037
She belongs here.
You do not.

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:12.975
Mrs. Ayres...

01:19:15.676 --> 01:19:18.045
What is it?

01:19:27.988 --> 01:19:30.488
How did you do this?

01:19:30.490 --> 01:19:32.493
My little girl is upset.

01:19:38.533 --> 01:19:40.569
Could you take this off,
please?

01:19:44.471 --> 01:19:46.407
Sit down.

01:19:49.210 --> 01:19:50.643
The cords were cut.
Don't you remember?

01:19:50.645 --> 01:19:56.048
When Susan was playing
such tricks on us.

01:19:56.050 --> 01:19:58.750
What did you...?
Let me see.

01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:02.388
Stop.

01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:05.191
Stop that. Stop it. Stop it.

01:20:05.193 --> 01:20:07.093
Stop it. Stop. Betty! Stop!

01:20:07.095 --> 01:20:08.163
Stop!

01:20:29.417 --> 01:20:31.349
I'm going to check on her.

01:20:31.351 --> 01:20:32.718
Let her sleep.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.623
She's still under the Veronal.

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:42.596
I'd like to bring in
a psychiatrist.

01:20:44.265 --> 01:20:48.366
First Roddie, now her.

01:20:48.368 --> 01:20:50.436
How long before it's my turn?

01:20:50.438 --> 01:20:52.407
That's absurd.

01:20:53.507 --> 01:20:55.107
My mother would rather die

01:20:55.109 --> 01:20:56.375
than bring any more shame
upon this family.

01:20:56.377 --> 01:20:58.376
I won't abandon her
to her delusions

01:20:58.378 --> 01:21:00.079
for the sake of class pride.

01:21:00.081 --> 01:21:02.016
No, Faraday.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:05.785
Do you understand?

01:21:05.787 --> 01:21:07.389
I forbid it.

01:21:51.565 --> 01:21:53.501
Faraday!

01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:57.469
Did you lock her in?

01:21:57.471 --> 01:21:59.541
What?

01:22:01.475 --> 01:22:04.343
Mother.

01:22:04.345 --> 01:22:06.111
Mother, open the door.

01:22:06.113 --> 01:22:07.780
Mrs. Ayres.

01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:21.794
What have you done, Mama?

01:22:21.796 --> 01:22:25.167
What have you done?
What have you done?

01:23:01.335 --> 01:23:03.434
<i>Like as a father pitieth</i>

01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:05.271
<i>his own children,</i>

01:23:05.273 --> 01:23:09.875
even so is the Lord merciful
unto them that fear Him.

01:23:09.877 --> 01:23:12.378
For He knoweth whereof
we are made.

01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.914
He remembereth
that we are but dust.

01:23:14.916 --> 01:23:16.949
<i>We mean to ask Caroline to come</i>

01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:18.951
and stay with us.

01:23:18.953 --> 01:23:21.320
Well, she can't be allowed
to remain all alone

01:23:21.322 --> 01:23:22.554
in that unhappy house.

01:23:22.556 --> 01:23:24.623
She isn't all alone.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.925
She has me.

01:23:32.934 --> 01:23:35.704
You've been very brave
today, Rod.

01:23:41.943 --> 01:23:44.677
Get Caroline out.

01:23:44.679 --> 01:23:46.614
She'll be next.

01:23:48.248 --> 01:23:49.548
It's all right.

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:04.562
No, no, no,
I, I've lots to sort out,

01:24:04.564 --> 01:24:05.897
but I'll be absolutely fine.

01:24:05.899 --> 01:24:09.634
We had such fun here
in the old days.

01:24:09.636 --> 01:24:11.903
I used to visit quite often,
but unfortunately

01:24:11.905 --> 01:24:13.938
my health hasn't
allowed that lately.

01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.609
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:24:17.444 --> 01:24:20.411
I'm afraid I can't remember
your name, Doctor.

01:24:20.413 --> 01:24:22.915
- Faraday.
- Ah.

01:24:22.917 --> 01:24:26.251
No.

01:24:26.253 --> 01:24:29.858
I don't believe my sister
ever mentioned you.

01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:52.710
Uh...

01:24:52.712 --> 01:24:55.414
I've been watching you.

01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:58.353
That can't have been
terribly interesting.

01:25:00.287 --> 01:25:01.954
It must be late.

01:25:01.956 --> 01:25:03.858
You should go.

01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:06.924
Not until you eat something.

01:25:06.926 --> 01:25:09.661
Oh, I couldn't.

01:25:09.663 --> 01:25:11.565
You must.

01:25:12.632 --> 01:25:14.967
I will eat. I promise.

01:25:14.969 --> 01:25:16.704
But later.

01:25:19.439 --> 01:25:22.509
Thank you for today.

01:25:29.582 --> 01:25:30.918
Caroline.

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.323
Tell me just one thing.

01:25:37.658 --> 01:25:40.058
When may we be married?

01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:42.428
Please, I'm so tired.

01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:44.562
I want to be here.

01:25:44.564 --> 01:25:47.098
With you.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.933
I've been patient, haven't I?

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:51.637
But so soon
after Mother's death, I...

01:25:51.639 --> 01:25:54.643
She'd want to know
you were being looked after.

01:25:56.077 --> 01:25:58.380
A month is long enough
to sort everything out.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:02.748
- But we have so much to discuss.
- I know.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.983
You'll need bridesmaids,
something to wear.

01:26:05.985 --> 01:26:07.986
No, I don't want a fuss.
I have plenty of dresses.

01:26:07.988 --> 01:26:09.024
Six weeks.

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:12.059
From today.

01:26:21.902 --> 01:26:24.503
Yes.

01:26:24.505 --> 01:26:25.907
Yes, all right.

01:26:27.006 --> 01:26:28.706
Yes?

01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:32.514
Can you please
just let me sleep?

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:49.394
The last time I sat down
to eat at this table, Betty,

01:26:49.396 --> 01:26:52.063
I was eight years old.

01:26:52.065 --> 01:26:53.932
My mother was with me,

01:26:53.934 --> 01:26:55.403
standing just over there.

01:26:56.503 --> 01:26:58.836
That's a funny thought.

01:26:58.838 --> 01:27:00.839
I never guessed
I'd be back here,

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:02.407
like this.

01:27:02.409 --> 01:27:05.744
Wish she'd lived to see it.

01:27:05.746 --> 01:27:06.980
My father, too.

01:27:11.585 --> 01:27:15.521
My father wants me
to go back home.

01:27:15.523 --> 01:27:18.123
He's on at me
something terrible.

01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:20.726
You and I are all Miss Caroline
has left.

01:27:20.728 --> 01:27:22.760
I need you
to help look after her.

01:27:22.762 --> 01:27:26.764
Well, he thinks there's a curse
on the house after...

01:27:26.766 --> 01:27:28.869
Madam.

01:27:31.771 --> 01:27:34.906
I think we all feel
a little bit that way.

01:27:34.908 --> 01:27:38.443
Miss Caroline says that
I should sleep upstairs now.

01:27:38.445 --> 01:27:41.780
I think she's frightened
by herself.

01:27:41.782 --> 01:27:45.550
What if I told you
that she wouldn't be by herself

01:27:45.552 --> 01:27:47.488
much longer?

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:53.592
That Miss Caroline
was soon to be married?

01:27:53.594 --> 01:27:55.693
Married?

01:27:55.695 --> 01:27:57.966
Mm.

01:28:00.868 --> 01:28:02.670
Oh, Doctor, when?

01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:06.037
Very soon.

01:28:06.039 --> 01:28:07.975
And I'm going
to need your help.

01:28:37.837 --> 01:28:39.838
<i>I, uh,</i>

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.706
<i>brought something
for you to copy.</i>

01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:43.642
You say the lady's indisposed.

01:28:43.644 --> 01:28:45.076
Will she be able to walk?

01:28:45.078 --> 01:28:47.812
Yes.

01:28:47.814 --> 01:28:49.013
It's nothing serious.

01:28:49.015 --> 01:28:50.652
Ah.

01:28:58.826 --> 01:28:59.924
Caroline.

01:28:59.926 --> 01:29:02.059
Cooped up inside
on this lovely day?

01:29:02.061 --> 01:29:04.466
You'll be absolutely kippered.

01:29:11.939 --> 01:29:14.873
This is flying in the face
of convention,

01:29:14.875 --> 01:29:16.978
I know, but, uh...

01:29:22.716 --> 01:29:24.982
I had it made
to match one of your others.

01:29:24.984 --> 01:29:27.251
Betty helped.

01:29:27.253 --> 01:29:30.789
We've been quite
the secret agents.

01:29:30.791 --> 01:29:34.726
There'll be something for your
head and hands, too, of course.

01:29:34.728 --> 01:29:36.831
And, lastly...

01:29:38.599 --> 01:29:39.998
This was my mother's.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.270
Sorry, I can't do this.

01:29:48.742 --> 01:29:50.942
Forgive me.

01:29:50.944 --> 01:29:53.144
I've sprung it on you.

01:29:53.146 --> 01:29:56.315
We'll look at these later
or in private

01:29:56.317 --> 01:29:59.918
- if you prefer...
- No, I mean I can't do any of it.

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.222
I can't marry you.

01:30:07.595 --> 01:30:08.860
Caroline...

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.062
I'm sorry.

01:30:11.064 --> 01:30:13.331
I like you very much,

01:30:13.333 --> 01:30:15.200
and I'm so grateful, but I-I...

01:30:15.202 --> 01:30:18.070
Darling, you're confused.

01:30:18.072 --> 01:30:20.237
No, I'm seeing very clearly.

01:30:20.239 --> 01:30:22.708
Please, you... you're tired.

01:30:22.710 --> 01:30:24.776
Stop saying that.

01:30:24.778 --> 01:30:28.679
Sometimes I think
you want me to be tired.

01:30:28.681 --> 01:30:30.182
You know
I want you to be happy.

01:30:30.184 --> 01:30:31.849
And I can't be happy

01:30:31.851 --> 01:30:33.988
if I marry you.

01:30:38.359 --> 01:30:41.159
We don't have to be husband
and wife right away,

01:30:41.161 --> 01:30:42.893
if that's the problem.

01:30:42.895 --> 01:30:44.763
God, can't you see?

01:30:44.765 --> 01:30:47.969
This whole thing between us
has never been real.

01:30:50.037 --> 01:30:51.969
I'm going away.

01:30:51.971 --> 01:30:54.005
I've put the estate
up for sale.

01:30:54.007 --> 01:30:56.808
You can't.
It's not yours to sell.

01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:59.678
Hepton's already drawn up
the papers.

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.147
I've had power of attorney
since Rod was first ill.

01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:03.915
When he gets better,
he can join me.

01:31:03.917 --> 01:31:05.250
Join you where?

01:31:05.252 --> 01:31:07.251
I'll go up to London
as soon as I can.

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:10.054
Then... Canada or America.

01:31:10.056 --> 01:31:12.723
Canada.

01:31:12.725 --> 01:31:14.992
But I will go.

01:31:14.994 --> 01:31:17.631
Before it's too late.

01:31:27.341 --> 01:31:29.941
Anne, I'm sorry,

01:31:29.943 --> 01:31:34.446
do you think David could take
my evening surgery?

01:31:34.448 --> 01:31:37.315
No, it's rather a violent
stomach thing, I'm afraid.

01:31:37.317 --> 01:31:41.189
I... I really would be
most grateful.

01:31:42.256 --> 01:31:44.726
Thank you.

01:32:07.213 --> 01:32:12.084
<i>The next few days
were a sort of blur,</i>

01:32:12.086 --> 01:32:15.222
<i>a bad dream
from which I was slow to wake.</i>

01:32:18.225 --> 01:32:20.695
<i>Hundreds Hall was lost to me.</i>

01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:24.998
<i>As was Caroline.</i>

01:32:27.801 --> 01:32:32.204
<i>There was, no doubt,
fun at my expense in Lidcote.</i>

01:32:32.206 --> 01:32:35.208
<i>That would teach me
to look outside my class.</i>

01:32:38.078 --> 01:32:42.080
<i>I did, for a time,
consider leaving, but...</i>

01:32:42.082 --> 01:32:45.286
<i>...a man cannot outrun himself.</i>

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.136
Doctor!

01:33:06.006 --> 01:33:09.107
Dr. Faraday!

01:36:35.148 --> 01:36:38.616
<i>The call came
sometime around 3:00.</i>

01:36:38.618 --> 01:36:40.652
<i>It was Betty.</i>

01:36:40.654 --> 01:36:43.254
<i>In a dreadful state.</i>

01:36:43.256 --> 01:36:45.022
<i>Wanting you, I suppose,</i>

01:36:45.024 --> 01:36:48.362
<i>but the exchange
passed her to me.</i>

01:36:49.462 --> 01:36:51.398
House call in Edgworth.

01:36:56.136 --> 01:36:58.072
It would have been instant.

01:36:59.706 --> 01:37:01.641
There's nothing
you could have done.

01:37:19.091 --> 01:37:22.496
<i>The court
calls Miss Elizabeth Walker.</i>

01:37:26.099 --> 01:37:30.134
We went to bed early
that night, Miss Ayres and me.

01:37:30.136 --> 01:37:32.803
We'd been cleaning all day;
we were tired.

01:37:32.805 --> 01:37:36.609
And did Miss Ayres seem to you
to be in low spirits?

01:37:38.045 --> 01:37:39.510
Not at all.

01:37:39.512 --> 01:37:41.278
She was happy,

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.482
- looking forward to leaving.
- So you went to your room

01:37:44.484 --> 01:37:47.052
and you heard
nothing more until...?

01:37:47.054 --> 01:37:49.187
About half past 2:00.

01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:52.223
Creak on the stairs.

01:37:52.225 --> 01:37:54.628
<i>At first I was frightened.</i>

01:37:57.130 --> 01:38:00.067
<i>Frightened because...?</i>

01:38:01.768 --> 01:38:05.139
<i>Big house, sir,
and-and sometimes...</i>

01:38:08.408 --> 01:38:11.142
<i>...well, it's lonely and dark.</i>

01:38:11.144 --> 01:38:14.211
<i>Then I realized
the steps were Miss Ayres.</i>

01:38:14.213 --> 01:38:17.214
<i>Her room was just opposite,
so I wasn't worried then.</i>

01:38:17.216 --> 01:38:20.453
- <i>Except...</i>
- <i>Except...?</i>

01:38:24.123 --> 01:38:26.124
<i>Except they were going up</i>

01:38:26.126 --> 01:38:28.726
<i>to the second floor.</i>

01:38:28.728 --> 01:38:30.762
<i>There's no reason
to go up there.</i>

01:38:30.764 --> 01:38:33.801
<i>It's empty, it's locked up.</i>

01:38:54.787 --> 01:38:57.522
<i>And-and then I heard her stop.</i>

01:39:05.832 --> 01:39:08.069
Make a sound.

01:39:14.573 --> 01:39:17.143
You.

01:39:22.782 --> 01:39:25.250
You.

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.714
Caroline.

01:40:09.496 --> 01:40:13.197
There's been an accident.

01:40:13.199 --> 01:40:14.566
Miss Caroline.

01:40:14.568 --> 01:40:15.836
<i>Dr. Faraday?</i>

01:40:19.939 --> 01:40:22.941
Dr. Faraday?

01:40:22.943 --> 01:40:26.777
Would you support
a verdict of suicide

01:40:26.779 --> 01:40:29.849
whilst of unsound mind?

01:40:35.555 --> 01:40:38.790
I believe, based on my dealings
with Miss Ayres

01:40:38.792 --> 01:40:40.857
in the last weeks of her life,

01:40:40.859 --> 01:40:44.595
that her mind
had become clouded.

01:40:44.597 --> 01:40:47.600
Her death may indeed
have been a suicide.

01:40:49.903 --> 01:40:52.206
Thank you, Dr. Faraday.

01:42:17.756 --> 01:42:20.625
<i>The first time
I saw Hundreds Hall</i>

01:42:20.627 --> 01:42:22.997
<i>was July 1919.</i>

01:42:24.898 --> 01:42:27.932
<i>I'd passed by its gates
often enough</i>

01:42:27.934 --> 01:42:30.468
<i>but never imagined
they would open to me,</i>

01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:32.972
<i>a common village boy.</i>

01:42:45.719 --> 01:42:47.718
<i>Oh, the whole world</i>

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:50.620
<i>of Hundreds
impressed me terribly.</i>

01:42:50.622 --> 01:42:53.057
<i>My mother
had described it often,</i>

01:42:53.059 --> 01:42:55.492
<i>but nothing
could have prepared me</i>

01:42:55.494 --> 01:42:57.995
<i>for the spell it cast that day.</i>
