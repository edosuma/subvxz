WEBVTT

00:20.311 --> 00:21.980
both:

00:39.497 --> 00:42.167
- Wow, your phone's really
blowing up.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.920
What's happening?

00:46.004 --> 00:48.173
I'm not getting service.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.091
- Oh, my God, what did you do?

00:50.175 --> 00:51.593
- Okay, okay.
I can explain.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.303
- Drop it!

00:53.386 --> 00:55.096
Drop it!
Barry, drop it.

00:55.180 --> 00:56.347
You know grapes can kill you.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.141
Reach into his mouth.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.476
Reach into his mouth!

00:59.559 --> 01:00.894
Barry, look at Mommy.
Look at Mommy.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.395
Spit it out.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.609
I love that smell!

01:07.692 --> 01:09.360
- Jet fuel and melting rubber?

01:09.444 --> 01:11.696
- Yup.
Vegas, baby.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.448
- Welcome home.
- Thank you.

01:13.531 --> 01:14.908
- Are you headed to
the Shops At Crystals?

01:14.991 --> 01:16.701
- No, no,
straight to the house.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.371
- You know, you go ahead.
I'm just gonna call a car

01:20.455 --> 01:22.290
and head back to the Palmetto,
I have some stuff to get,

01:22.373 --> 01:23.625
I have a couple calls
to make, so--

01:23.708 --> 01:24.918
- No, you're going with me.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.337
We got a lot
of work to do, kiddo.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.109
- That was fast.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.611
- No, no, it's good.
It's good.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.154
That was the old show.
I'm done with that.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.864
We're gonna work
this new one out on the road

01:54.948 --> 01:57.158
and it's gonna get me
a bigger and better residency.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.911
And the Palmetto
can kiss my ass.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.038
- Totally.

02:02.121 --> 02:03.456
- You know,
I haven't been this excited

02:03.540 --> 02:04.749
about my material in years.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.376
It's invigorating
when you bomb

02:06.459 --> 02:07.836
and you have
to start from scratch.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.254
It's like when you
clean out your closet

02:09.337 --> 02:10.338
and you buy
a whole new wardrobe.

02:10.421 --> 02:11.756
- Can't relate.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.591
I still wear my bras
from the eighth grade.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.176
- Now those bras
you should burn.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.223
- Oh, put him on speaker.
I need to talk to him.

02:22.308 --> 02:23.393
- Jimmy.
- Are you trying

02:23.476 --> 02:24.978
to put me in the ground?

02:25.061 --> 02:27.188
- Uh, you're here--it's me
and Deborah in the car.

02:27.272 --> 02:31.109
- Oh, hey, Deborah.
I'm on speaker.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.986
What are you guys doing?

02:33.069 --> 02:34.654
- I wanna have a meeting
in 20 to plan this tour.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.197
I'll get Damien and Marcus.
We'll call you back.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.074
- Great and Ava,
maybe afterward you can

02:38.157 --> 02:39.909
just give me a quick call,
you can just catch--

02:41.911 --> 02:43.663
- Hey, Ben, turn that up.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.224
- Kayla,
we've been over what is

03:03.308 --> 03:05.560
inappropriate behavior
in the past.

03:05.643 --> 03:06.978
- I said I'm sorry.
Okay?

03:07.061 --> 03:08.688
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm being,

03:08.771 --> 03:11.190
like, arrested for wearing
pajamas on a business trip.

03:11.274 --> 03:15.486
- They were not pajamas.
It was silk lingerie.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.405
- Okay, the fashion police
is here.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.324
I didn't know I was going
on a trip with Stacy London.

03:19.407 --> 03:23.828
- Okay guys, let's be careful
not to police anyone's fashion,

03:23.912 --> 03:27.081
but also, Kayla, it did
make Jimmy uncomfortable.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.750
- Look, I'm just not sure
I'm comfortable

03:28.833 --> 03:29.918
with her staying on my desk.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.461
- But I don't, like, get that

03:31.544 --> 03:33.421
because he was,
like, my babysitter.

03:33.504 --> 03:34.881
Like, he's changed my diapers.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.966
What are you talking about?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.718
I was not your babysitter.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.428
We were around each other
as kids 'cause our dads

03:40.511 --> 03:42.472
were in business together,
but I never babysat you.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.933
- Um, I literally remember you
changing my diaper.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.102
- Ew, Kayla! You don't remember
being a baby.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.687
You don't even remember
my lunch order.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.731
- Uh, Mendocino Farms
Chinese chicken salad!

03:51.814 --> 03:53.149
- Well that's a first!

03:53.232 --> 03:54.943
- Kayla, your behavior was

03:55.026 --> 03:56.861
interpreted as a sexual advance

03:56.945 --> 03:58.655
and anything of a sexual nature

03:58.738 --> 04:00.531
is against Latitude's
code of conduct.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.700
- Okay, I just think
that it's gonna be hard

04:02.784 --> 04:06.204
because, you know, we work
in the entertainment business.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.999
And every movie or
TV show's about sex.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.960
- That is so not true.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.795
- Name one movie
that's not about sex.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.130
- "Sophie's Choice,"
"Schindler's List,"

04:16.214 --> 04:17.715
"Saving Private Ryan."

04:17.799 --> 04:21.177
- Okay, name one movie
that's not about sex or Nazis.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.805
- "Cast Away."
- That's about masturbation.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.684
- Okay, Barbara,
help me out here please.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.687
- Um, "Pig In The City."

04:30.770 --> 04:32.105
- Oh, my God.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.234
- Okay, so on this tour

04:36.317 --> 04:38.444
I wanna do 35 dates
before Christmas.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.113
That means
I think we should start

04:40.196 --> 04:42.365
in the San Francisco Orpheum
and move our way east.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.909
- Love that idea,
but I do think a lot

04:44.993 --> 04:48.079
of the larger venues
are likely already booked.

04:48.162 --> 04:49.497
- That's fine.
I'll do drop ins.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.999
I'll do whatever it takes.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.667
I mean, I don't expect
this to be a money maker.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.169
It's all about back to basics.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.880
And we need a really good
tour manager, Vinny DeMoan.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.092
- Oh, uh, he...died.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.720
- Oh.
Did we send flowers?

05:03.803 --> 05:05.888
- Yeah.
- Yes.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.682
- Well, we gotta get
somebody really good.

05:07.765 --> 05:09.183
- Okay, yup. I'll have Kayla
check some avails.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.185
- Love it.
Oh, by the way,

05:11.269 --> 05:12.937
put Helen and Marcel
on retainer so that

05:13.021 --> 05:14.772
they're available
when I get the new residency.

05:14.856 --> 05:18.609
- So they've already put in
their two weeks' notice.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.112
They're doing makeup
for the Blue Man Group.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.864
- Oh.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.366
Well, they probably need less
time in the chair than I do.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.708
Damien, did you check into
that tour bus I sent you?

05:33.791 --> 05:35.835
- I did.
Unfortunately,

05:35.918 --> 05:38.880
it's currently
in use by Lil Uzi Vert.

05:38.963 --> 05:41.507
- Lil--
- Uzi Vert.

05:41.591 --> 05:47.013
- Okay, look, does anybody
have anything positive to add?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.723
- I think this
could be a great time

05:48.806 --> 05:51.726
to repaint the moldings
in the sitting rooms.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.896
- Yes.
Thank you, Josefina.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.397
Thank you.
This is good, this is good.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.399
Everybody's busy.
We got lots to do.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.069
Oh, and Marcus, this means
I'm gonna be on the road,

06:01.152 --> 06:04.405
you'll have a lot more time
for your favorite water cop.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.657
- So true.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.910
- Let's circle back
to the moldings.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.579
I have a connection at Valspar.
- Ooh.

06:11.662 --> 06:14.332
- And I'm thinking
maybe eggshell

06:14.415 --> 06:15.958
or satin?
- Mm, satin, satin.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.460
- Okay.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.630
- Hey,
this is Jimmy Lusaque Jr.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.881
Leave a message.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.182
- Hello?
- Hi, Daisy.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.143
It's Ava
from that horrible meeting.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.686
I mean, it started good.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.063
- Yeah, I recall.

06:37.146 --> 06:38.523
- Okay, so look,
I really shouldn't

06:38.606 --> 06:39.857
have sent you that email.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.943
I mean, my bad.
My bad 10,000, you know?

06:42.026 --> 06:45.154
Anyway, I'm calling
as a friend to say you really

06:45.238 --> 06:46.906
shouldn't use
anything from the email.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.659
I mean, for your own sake.
Deborah can be very litigious,

06:49.742 --> 06:51.494
and I think
she'll come after you is all.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.079
And I just don't think
you want that kind of

06:53.162 --> 06:55.623
a headache
in the first season of a show.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.209
- Oh, well that's very
kind of you, but we actually

06:58.292 --> 06:59.919
just forwarded your email
to the studio.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.421
And since you very specifically
ended your note with:

07:02.505 --> 07:05.341
"I officially release my
permission over these stories,"

07:05.424 --> 07:06.634
we're sorted.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.094
- Okay, I shouldn't
have sent that.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.887
I was way out of line.
I was just upset

07:09.971 --> 07:11.973
and Deborah had
just slapped me and--

07:12.056 --> 07:14.976
- Wait, she slapped you?

07:15.059 --> 07:19.063
- Was that not in the email?
- No.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.028
- Ah, shit.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.363
- Is that "Jingle Bells?"

07:27.446 --> 07:28.990
- Yeah, I'm in Deborah's
Christmas room.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.408
Don't use that.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.868
- You know,
I'm gonna do you a favor

07:31.951 --> 07:33.327
and just hang up, yeah?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.580
- Thank you.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.513
- Hi, honey.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.562
You're eating
Josefina's chicken pot pie

07:59.645 --> 08:01.731
and it's 10 a.m.
What's wrong?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.357
- No, don't, don't.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.360
Don't psychoanalyze my pot pie,
all right?

08:06.444 --> 08:09.488
- Okay, okay.
I just meant that, you know,

08:09.572 --> 08:12.116
the last time you did this was
when Carrot Top ghosted you.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.534
- Well,
if he didn't wanna date,

08:13.618 --> 08:15.203
then he should've
had an adult conversation.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.079
- I told you to
never date a comedian

08:17.163 --> 08:18.831
and you're
way out of his league.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.541
- Yeah, I'm out
of Carrot Top's league.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.043
That's what made
the whole thing so fucked up.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.544
Oh, God, Mom.
You know what?

08:23.628 --> 08:25.880
Look, I didn't wanna
tell you like this,

08:25.963 --> 08:28.257
but I've been doing IVF

08:28.341 --> 08:31.177
because Aidan and I
wanna start a family.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.723
- Oh.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.812
- It was the second round,
and it didn't

08:41.896 --> 08:43.522
it didn't take,
and I just--

08:43.606 --> 08:45.066
I didn't want Aidan
to see me upset

08:45.149 --> 08:47.944
'cause he's training
for tomorrow's fight.

08:48.027 --> 08:49.487
- Okay.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.530
Well, you know,
maybe it's for the best.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.699
I mean, you did
just meet this guy.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.577
- This guy?

08:56.661 --> 08:59.580
Aidan is my husband, Mom.
He's a part of our family.

08:59.664 --> 09:02.583
- I--I just meant that
in case it didn't work out,

09:02.667 --> 09:06.545
that it would probably be good
not to rush into having a child

09:06.629 --> 09:09.674
in the unlikely event
of a divorce.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.634
- You are unbelievable.
You know what?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.344
Forget it.
I'm leaving anyway.

09:13.427 --> 09:14.929
Josefina forgot
the fucking peas

09:15.012 --> 09:16.389
so this pot pie
tastes like shit.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.271
- Hello. Hi!
- Hello.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.148
- Here's the script
you wanted, ugly.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.734
- Kayla, you don't have
to call me ugly.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.445
- What?
Barbara said not to be sexual.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.322
Isn't the opposite
of being sexual

09:33.406 --> 09:34.824
telling you have a fugly face?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.325
- No, it's actually bullying.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.910
- What do you want me to say?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.537
That during the company
softball game

09:39.620 --> 09:41.163
I saw the full outline
of your wiener

09:41.247 --> 09:43.749
through your mesh shorts,
and it was surprisingly big

09:43.833 --> 09:45.376
for somebody
with such a high voice.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.420
Happy now, ugly?
- No.

09:47.503 --> 09:48.671
- See?
Really high.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.172
- Okay, Kayla, just--

09:50.256 --> 09:54.969
can you shut the door, please?

09:55.052 --> 09:57.013
- What?
- No.

09:57.096 --> 09:59.807
I want you to leave
and then shut the door.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.352
- Okay!
God, help us all!

10:03.436 --> 10:04.687
- Okay, stop yelling.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.023
We're in a corporate
environment.

10:07.106 --> 10:10.484
Ava, I'm on a razor's edge.
Are you alone?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.528
- Yeah, I'm hiding out
in Deborah's Christmas room.

10:12.611 --> 10:15.489
Somehow it feels racist in
here, but I can't explain why.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.366
Anyway, look,
I've been thinking

10:17.450 --> 10:19.160
and I think I should
just own up to it

10:19.243 --> 10:20.536
and tell Deborah
about the email.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.496
- Highly, highly disagree.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.123
She will kill you

10:24.206 --> 10:25.875
if she finds out and me,
all right?

10:25.958 --> 10:28.836
Do me a favor,
do not do anything.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.296
- Okay.

10:30.379 --> 10:34.550
Okay,
I won't do anything further.

10:34.633 --> 10:36.969
But I--I should tell you,

10:37.053 --> 10:38.846
I did call Daisy,
and I made it worse.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.514
- Ava, I need you
to take your phone

10:40.598 --> 10:42.641
and I need you to throw it
into the ocean.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.685
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Good note, good note.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.897
- Listen, I'm trying to get in
touch with Janet Stone, okay?

10:47.980 --> 10:49.273
She represents Daisy and Jesse.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.816
I'm gonna try
and reason with her.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.943
- Uh, isn't that the manager

10:53.027 --> 10:55.529
who beat her assistant
with a stapler?

10:55.613 --> 10:58.366
- No, three-hole punch.
Much heavier.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.951
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, she gives good,

11:01.035 --> 11:03.704
decent reps like me a bad name.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.039
Anyway, I gotta go make

11:05.122 --> 11:07.083
a sexual harassment
situation go away.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.294
- Wow, um, okay.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.338
Okay, bye.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.134
Seriously, Ray,
you couldn't have just waited

11:17.218 --> 11:19.178
a few days for me to come by
and get my stuff?

11:19.261 --> 11:22.932
- Ms. Vance doesn't have
a comped room here anymore,

11:23.015 --> 11:25.601
so we were asked
to clear it out.

11:25.684 --> 11:30.398
But I put all the overflow
in these bags.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.692
- Ah, cool.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.610
Everything's nice and loose
in there.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.070
- Yeah.
- Wait.

11:36.153 --> 11:38.906
I had a Cadbury Crème Egg
that I hadn't eaten,

11:38.989 --> 11:41.242
and they're seasonal, so
they're kinda hard to get now.

11:41.325 --> 11:43.536
Do you remember it?
- Are you serious?

11:45.621 --> 11:46.580
No.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.750
- Oh, also you got a package.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.669
- I did?
- Yeah.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.890
Yo, are those ashes?
- Oh, my God.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.103
Can you give me a sec?

12:11.355 --> 12:15.860
- Ava, did you get your dad?
I mean, half of him?

12:15.943 --> 12:19.447
- Mom, why the hell did you
send me half of dad's ashes?

12:19.530 --> 12:21.615
- Because I'm keeping
the other half.

12:21.699 --> 12:25.035
- Okay, and why did you mail
him in a tennis ball tube?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.371
- First of all,
I overnighted him.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.914
It was $44

12:28.998 --> 12:31.459
and I'm not going to
pick out an urn for you.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.544
I don't want you
calling me screaming

12:33.627 --> 12:35.296
that the urn
doesn't match your décor.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.965
- Since when have I called you
screaming about anything?

12:38.048 --> 12:40.676
- Never
because you barely call.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.803
- Oh, my God.
I gotta go.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.312
Yup, ashes.

12:51.395 --> 12:54.648
Sorry, my dad just died, so--

12:54.732 --> 12:56.859
- I'm sorry for your loss.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.986
My dad passed away
a few years ago

12:59.069 --> 13:01.489
and we cremated him, too.

13:01.572 --> 13:04.825
Although we did put him in,
like, a proper vessel.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.828
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.289
If you ever need to talk
or whatever,

13:10.372 --> 13:14.084
I'm always here
except Tuesdays and Thursdays.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.965
- Thanks, Ray.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.300
- Sure.

13:23.427 --> 13:28.974
- Man, all this time
we could've been friends maybe.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.768
- Maybe.

13:30.851 --> 13:33.771
I mean, you've always been
pretty entitled and annoying.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.190
- I hear that, brother.

13:36.273 --> 13:39.527
A lot, so-
- Yeah, cool.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.363
Um, well--

13:42.446 --> 13:44.448
- Yeah, let me know
about that egg.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.959
Have you ever tried
a regular meditation practice?

13:55.042 --> 13:56.335
Apparently it can really help

13:56.418 --> 13:59.171
if you have
emotional irregularity.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.382
- I don't have
emotional irregularity.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.342
- Sure, but I mean,
look, you never know

14:03.425 --> 14:04.927
what could trigger you
at any moment.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.929
- Uh-huh.
Josefina!

14:08.931 --> 14:11.100
Yeah, I'm missing
all the local papers.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.102
- Oh, they're not there?
- No.

14:13.185 --> 14:17.273
- Weird.
Weird stuff.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.149
I'll check.

14:19.233 --> 14:22.319
- Also, there's this book
by Michael Pollan

14:22.403 --> 14:24.863
about how psilocybin,
uh, mushrooms,

14:24.947 --> 14:28.534
can actually rewire your brain
to create new neural pathways.

14:28.617 --> 14:29.785
I mean,
it's the biggest advancement

14:29.868 --> 14:32.037
in altering mood since Prozac.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.915
- You know, I've never
said this to anyone in my life,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.459
but I think you need
to read less.

14:38.752 --> 14:42.381
- Okay, I found them.
- Thank you.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.266
No arts section.

14:52.349 --> 14:56.604
- Maybe they skipped a week.
They do that sometimes.

14:56.687 --> 15:00.441
- Josefina,
I know I bombed my show.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.443
I don't read reviews.
I don't need to see

15:02.526 --> 15:05.195
all the nasty things people
have written about me.

15:05.279 --> 15:09.074
- Okay. There's a very good
"Garfield" today.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.454
- Sure, I'll check it out.

15:33.140 --> 15:35.476
- I would just ask that you
remember my boundary please

15:35.559 --> 15:37.061
and don't open any cabinets.
- Don't open any cabinets.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.646
Look, honey, I just wanted
to come by

15:38.729 --> 15:40.481
and say that I'm sorry
for what I said yesterday.

15:40.564 --> 15:44.318
And I think that you should try
the IVF thing again.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.653
- Thank you, but I don't know

15:45.736 --> 15:47.655
if I can handle
the disappointment.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.573
- I understand.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.785
My God.
Jesus, this place is a mess.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.453
What is all this stuff?
- I know.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.498
It's a little cramped,
but that's married life right?

15:57.581 --> 16:00.584
I mean, it's only until
we find a bigger place.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.003
- I'm glad to see
you finally got a gun.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.964
- Ew, no. I'm, like, anti-gun
or whatever.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.257
This is Aidan's
paintball stuff.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.802
- Mom! Hey!
- Hey.

16:09.885 --> 16:12.930
- Come here. Come on.
- Hi, Aidan.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.891
- Oh, I had no idea
that you were coming over.

16:15.974 --> 16:18.519
- Yeah, surprise.
- I gotta head to the gym.

16:18.602 --> 16:21.188
I still got ten pounds to cut
for tomorrow's weigh-in.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.606
- Ten?
- Yeah.

16:22.690 --> 16:23.899
- You gotta show me
your technique.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.239
All right, babe.
Muah, I love you.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.741
- Love you.
- Mom, I'll see you soon.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.452
- Okay.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.954
I want the "Mom" thing to stop.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.707
- I know but he's from Ohio,
so--

16:39.790 --> 16:41.291
And you better be coming
to his fight.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.044
- Oh, I--
- Mom, come on.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.879
You love boxing.
It's not that different.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.465
- Yes, it is.
It's a lot more violent

16:48.549 --> 16:51.760
and I don't like seeing
men's bare feet.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.304
- Listen, he's finally
in UFC proper.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.640
It's a huge night for him.
- Exactly, exactly.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.434
That's why the night should be
all about him.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.728
You know what it's like when
I go to one of these events.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.605
They put me up on the jumbotron
and make a big to-do.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.107
I don't want
to steal his thunder.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.567
- It's fine.
He doesn't care.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.860
He really wants you there.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.070
It's weird.
He's, like, desperate

17:10.154 --> 17:12.364
for your approval or something.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.283
Do you like this?
- No.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.118
- No, right? Ugh.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.371
- Okay, fine. I'll come.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.915
- Really?
- Yes, but he better win.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.625
- Oh, no, he's not gonna win.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.419
No, the other guy is a monster.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.254
Do you know
what his nickname is?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.797
The Maim Train.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.300
- Oh, well that's not scary.
That's just juvenile.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.010
- Well, he's terrifying.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.429
Aidan not getting paralyzed,
that's the win.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.806
- Jesus.
- I know.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.350
People have no idea
what we go through.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.645
- We?
- Yeah, wives of MMA fighters.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.939
His job is combat.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.193
I mean, I'm basically
a military wife.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.737
Every morning he gets up
and goes to work.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.490
And when I wake up
a few hours later,

17:54.573 --> 17:57.159
I don't know if
I'm ever gonna see him again.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.587
- Hey.
- Victor, is Wilson home?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.589
- No, sorry.
He's out.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.883
- Well, actually
I was just here to drop off

18:12.966 --> 18:17.721
some of his stuff, but it's
probably good he's not here.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.098
Better, actually.

18:20.182 --> 18:24.645
- Okay, this is half a bag
of granola and a Flonase.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.188
- Well, the Flonase
is practically new.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.190
So I figured he might
need it soon.

18:28.273 --> 18:33.070
So I--you know what?
Actually, um--

18:33.153 --> 18:35.322
Don't tell him I was here.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.617
- Yeah, I can't give him
half a bag of granola

18:38.700 --> 18:41.537
and a practically new Flonase
without an explanation.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.581
- Okay, okay.
Well, tell him I was here

18:44.665 --> 18:46.834
but I was just stopping by

18:46.917 --> 18:50.838
real quickly on my way
to a party.

18:50.921 --> 18:53.507
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.759
Actually, tell him--

18:55.843 --> 18:58.011
tell him that I was
going to the gym.

18:58.095 --> 19:00.264
Or a date.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.308
This is pathetic.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.978
- Yeah, but he won't stop
eating my Skinny Cows,

19:06.061 --> 19:07.271
and it's really fucking
annoying,

19:07.354 --> 19:09.189
so I'll tell him
whatever you want.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.401
- Okay. A date.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.486
- Maybe stick with party.

19:14.570 --> 19:18.198
I feel like that's more fun.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.409
- Sure.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.995
- Take care, diva.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.712
- So after further
investigation

19:31.795 --> 19:34.047
and speaking with legal,
we have determined

19:34.131 --> 19:35.632
that this was
a misunderstanding

19:35.716 --> 19:38.385
and that Kayla
will remain at you desk.

19:38.468 --> 19:39.428
- Yes!
- Oh, my God.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.762
Are you kidding me?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.806
Barbara, who did you talk to?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.766
- Probably everyone.
This whole office

19:44.850 --> 19:48.061
is always talking about
our will they/won't they.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.897
- They won't!

19:52.649 --> 19:54.234
- Okay, Kayla, would you mind

19:54.318 --> 19:56.528
stepping out
for a moment, please?

19:56.612 --> 19:57.654
- Yeah.

19:59.072 --> 20:00.741
Thank you.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.330
Justice!

20:07.915 --> 20:09.249
- Barbara, this is insane.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.543
- So I can't discipline Kayla

20:11.627 --> 20:13.837
for reasons
I think you understand.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.172
- 'Cause her dad's the boss.

20:15.255 --> 20:19.635
- Right, but
I could discipline you.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.179
- Uh, no thank you.

20:22.262 --> 20:24.932
- Listen, if you were to have,
say, anger issues,

20:25.015 --> 20:26.433
I could recommend that Kayla

20:26.516 --> 20:30.854
be moved off your desk
for her own safety.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.524
- Right.
- But if it goes in your file,

20:34.608 --> 20:38.070
you will have to take
anger management classes.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.238
So what do you think?

20:40.322 --> 20:41.782
- Hmm.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.578
Hey, Adam, love that tie.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.246
- Thanks.
You're in a good mood.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.499
- Well, I have anger issues.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.049
- And what I don't get is
why all the cheerleaders

20:59.132 --> 21:01.885
for WNBA games aren't all men.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.346
- Oh, I've never really
thought about it.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.973
Hey, Tony.
- Hey, Ms. Vance.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.725
Oh, sorry.
Employees only.

21:08.809 --> 21:11.353
- Tony,
my car already pulled out.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.646
You're gonna make me walk
all the way

21:12.729 --> 21:14.064
around the casino
in this heat?

21:14.147 --> 21:15.649
- They get on me
about this shit.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.860
I'm sorry.
Really.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.279
- Tony.
- Ava!

21:21.363 --> 21:23.907
- What the fuck?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.618
- I can't believe that guy.

21:26.702 --> 21:30.330
It's a little better in here.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.172
Mr. Las Vegas!

21:39.256 --> 21:41.049
- Mrs. Las Vegas!

21:41.133 --> 21:44.052
- Ms.
- You got odds on this fight?

21:44.136 --> 21:46.221
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Odds are I'm gonna wanna leave

21:46.304 --> 21:48.724
in about 20 minutes.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.142
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.935
- Just promise me that

21:52.019 --> 21:55.022
I'm going to see you
at my New Year's party.

21:55.105 --> 21:56.273
- Oh, God,
honey, with bells on.

21:56.356 --> 21:57.691
Of course.
- Great.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.026
- Nice to see you, baby.
- Great, great, great.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.360
Nice to see you.
- Bye.

22:02.612 --> 22:06.199
- I'm getting
a massive ice luge.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.784
- I would love a ring like
that.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.286
- Oh, thank you. Yeah, you
can't clap with it

22:09.369 --> 22:10.871
'cause it'll bruise you,
but it's worth it.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.165
- Ah!
- Hi, hi, hi, hi!

22:13.248 --> 22:15.167
- Hi, sweetie.
- Oh.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.044
Oh, wow, you're sweaty.
- I am?

22:17.127 --> 22:19.546
- Oh, Mom, you're nervous, too.
Calm down, okay?

22:19.629 --> 22:22.215
Because he's gonna be okay.
He's gotta be okay.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.884
- You want some popcorn?

22:23.967 --> 22:25.677
- Uh, why is it in your purse?

22:25.761 --> 22:27.429
- It's my popcorn purse.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.973
- I pop it at home
and I sneak it in.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.434
- Holy shit, this is, like, the
best popcorn I've ever eaten.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.685
- Yeah, no shit.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.812
It has nutritional yeast
and Flavacol.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.565
I got the recipe from my
favorite vegan beauty podcast.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.358
- Is this a Starbucks
gift card?

22:40.442 --> 22:43.612
- Ooh! I've been
looking for that.

22:43.695 --> 22:46.406
I also use this purse
as a purse.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.700
- Oh, excuse me.
I'll be right back.

22:48.784 --> 22:49.826
- Okay.

22:51.828 --> 22:53.205
Popcorn?
- Yes.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.332
- I can't eat corn
on an empty stomach.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.250
It's a disaster.

22:57.334 --> 22:58.877
- You look like a bull,
that's what you look like.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.796
- Hey, hey, hey.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.381
- Ah, look what
the cat dragged in.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.674
Look at you.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.259
- Deb, I didn't think
you'd be here.

23:06.343 --> 23:10.097
I know how you don't like
seeing men's bare feet.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.809
This is actually my
son-in-law's first UFC fight.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.894
- Ah, right, of course.

23:15.977 --> 23:19.481
Well, it's--
it's nice to see you.

23:19.564 --> 23:23.318
- Good to see you, too.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.945
- What am I, chopped liver?
What's happening?

23:25.028 --> 23:26.363
- Oh, Mayor.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.115
- You look great.
- It's so lovely to see you.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.367
- Oh, thank you so much.
I just had my hair done.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.868
- Nice.
- So no date?

23:31.952 --> 23:33.829
Oh, no, don't tell me
she already got carded

23:33.912 --> 23:35.872
and had to go home.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.290
- No, she was just here
a second ago.

23:37.374 --> 23:41.628
Where did she go?
Ah, here she is now.

23:41.711 --> 23:45.132
Deborah, Mayor Jo,
this is Victoria Calle.

23:45.215 --> 23:48.301
- Very nice to meet you, Mayor,
and Deborah, of course.

23:48.385 --> 23:51.805
I am a fan.
It's so, so lovely to meet you.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.019
- It's a pleasure
to meet you as well.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.521
We actually have
to get to our seats.

23:59.604 --> 24:03.150
If you will excuse us.
Thank you.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.026
My God.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.112
That was shocking.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.655
I did not see
that fucking coming.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.032
My God, she's old.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.410
Unbelievable.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.371
- Can you tickle my arm?

24:16.454 --> 24:18.498
- What's that?
- Do, like, a baby tickle.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.625
It just helps calm me down.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.502
- Uh, sure.

24:24.421 --> 24:25.839
- I mean, get your--
you gotta get your nails

24:25.922 --> 24:27.174
a little bit involved.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.800
There we go.
- Sorry, they're short.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.390
- Ladies and gentlemen,

24:35.473 --> 24:38.852
we have a special guest
here tonight.

24:38.935 --> 24:41.271
You know them
from their residency

24:41.354 --> 24:43.565
here at the

24:43.648 --> 24:46.818
Give it up for MC Ludwig!

24:48.486 --> 24:50.488
- MC Ludwig!

24:50.572 --> 24:51.698
Who are you rooting
for tonight?

24:51.781 --> 24:53.033
- My boy, the Maim Train.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.452
Predicting a K-O.
Choo!

24:55.535 --> 24:58.830
all: Choo!

24:58.914 --> 25:01.166
- And now,
everyone please stand

25:01.249 --> 25:04.711
for our special guest,
Wendy Mae Waters,

25:04.794 --> 25:09.257
treating us to her rendition
of the National Anthem.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.023
- Oh, shit.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.027
Oh, Jesus.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.366
- You okay?

25:34.449 --> 25:37.202
- You know,
I did read those reviews.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.998
And I knew I bombed, but--

25:42.082 --> 25:44.459
- I thought you don't read
reviews 'cause you don't care.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.420
- I don't read reviews
because I do care.

25:47.504 --> 25:51.007
You'd think at some point
I'd stop, but--

25:51.091 --> 25:53.468
- It's just a local paper.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.929
- It's my hometown paper

25:56.012 --> 25:58.431
and this city's full
of criminals and hookers

25:58.515 --> 26:00.475
and magicians for God's sakes.

26:00.558 --> 26:01.810
No one cares.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.479
This is the one place
nobody judges you.

26:04.562 --> 26:07.607
- Well, a dude did just call me
a socialist bitch

26:07.691 --> 26:09.484
when I walked out
on the National Anthem, so...

26:13.113 --> 26:15.532
You know, they never gave
a shit about me in L.A.

26:15.615 --> 26:19.119
or New York,

26:19.202 --> 26:21.538
but at least
they wanted me here.

26:23.206 --> 26:26.084
And now the Review Journal
says that...

26:26.167 --> 26:29.212
it's...

26:29.296 --> 26:32.424
it's not my town anymore.

26:32.507 --> 26:35.427
- I think you'll feel better
when you're on the road.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.722
- I don't know.

26:41.057 --> 26:44.728
I'm not so sure this tour
is a good idea.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.187
- Deborah.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.241
How's it going?

26:58.325 --> 26:59.492
- Bad.

27:04.664 --> 27:05.957
- Uh!

27:07.751 --> 27:09.627
Oh, God.

27:09.711 --> 27:10.962
Oh! No, no, no!

27:12.672 --> 27:15.133
Hey, watch the balls!

27:17.510 --> 27:19.512
Oh, God!

27:19.596 --> 27:21.264
- No! Ooh!

27:25.101 --> 27:28.980
- Yeah, bro, beat his ass!
Whoo!

27:31.107 --> 27:34.235
- No, no, no, no! Get up!
Get up!

27:35.945 --> 27:38.073
- Come on, Aidan, get up.

27:44.537 --> 27:46.956
- Choo!
all: Choo!

27:47.040 --> 27:49.167
- Yo, yo, this dude
is an idiot, bro.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.295
He should just tap out.
- Give up, man!

27:58.927 --> 28:01.554
- Mom! What--oh, my God.
What are you doing?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.932
- Excuse me.
Move, move, move.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.601
Aidan, Aidan.
- Mom?

28:06.684 --> 28:09.062
- Hey, lady, you can't--
- It's cool.

28:09.145 --> 28:11.648
- Aidan, listen to me.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.067
Look at me.

28:14.150 --> 28:17.070
Everybody thinks you're done.

28:17.153 --> 28:19.739
No one believes in you, okay?

28:19.823 --> 28:21.282
They want to see you
get knocked down

28:21.366 --> 28:23.410
and they want you to stay down.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.287
But guess what?
You're gonna get back up

28:26.371 --> 28:28.289
and you're gonna
find his weakness.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.750
And you're gonna hit it hard.

28:30.834 --> 28:34.879
And you're gonna hit it again
and again and again.

28:34.963 --> 28:38.842
In fact, you're gonna hit him
so hard, he doesn't get angry,

28:38.925 --> 28:41.761
he gets scared.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.430
You're the underdog,

28:43.513 --> 28:47.434
but you're gonna get back up
because you're a Vance now.

28:47.517 --> 28:50.311
So go kill him.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.147
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.441
- Okay.
- Go!

28:54.524 --> 28:58.194
Go, Aidan!
Come on!

28:59.529 --> 29:00.989
- Fighter, you ready?
Fighter, you ready?

29:01.072 --> 29:02.157
Let's fight!

29:02.240 --> 29:03.825
- Go, Aidan!

29:05.869 --> 29:07.120
- Oh!

29:08.830 --> 29:10.123
- Go!

29:10.206 --> 29:11.541
That's it, that's it,
that's it, that's--

29:11.624 --> 29:13.543
- Hey, you can't be up--
- Oh, please.

29:14.544 --> 29:15.628
- Yo!

29:18.089 --> 29:19.174
- Oh, my God!

29:21.885 --> 29:22.927
Yes, yes!

29:23.011 --> 29:24.679
- Get him, get him, get him!

29:25.889 --> 29:26.973
Yes!

29:27.056 --> 29:28.933
- Yeah!

29:29.017 --> 29:31.227
- Whoo!

29:33.771 --> 29:36.065
- I fucking love you, babe!

29:36.149 --> 29:39.694
- I fucking love you,
babe!

29:39.777 --> 29:42.238
- This is our fuckin' city!

29:42.322 --> 29:43.531
Whoo!

29:44.949 --> 29:47.494
- Do not fuck
with Deborah Vance.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.787
- Fuck you!
- Whoo!

29:49.871 --> 29:51.372
- Yeah!

29:51.456 --> 29:53.333
- Jimmy, I was wrong.
You were right.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.043
Deborah's absolutely capable
of killing me.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.753
She cannot find out about
that email.

29:56.836 --> 29:59.672
- Okay, okay. Calm down.
I'm working on it.

29:59.756 --> 30:03.176
But for the time being,
just stay away from her.

30:03.259 --> 30:04.761
- Ava.
- Oh, gotta go.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.846
- Ava, you were right.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.431
I'm gonna feel a lot better
once I'm on the road.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.100
That's why we're going tonight
just you and me.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.268
- Just us?
- Mm-hmm.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.145
- No.
What about the bus?

30:14.229 --> 30:15.563
The big bus.
- Oh, no.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.190
We can meet up with them
in a couple of weeks.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.192
Tour starts tonight.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.156
Oh, thank God you're up.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.991
- Yeah, yeah,
I got to monitor Aidan.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.159
Make sure he doesn't
fall asleep.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.494
He could slip into a coma.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.371
I'm just reading him
"Harry Potter."

30:31.454 --> 30:32.914
- Oh.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.542
- Hey, you know, I wanted
to thank you again for tonight.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.544
- Oh.
- It meant a lot

30:37.627 --> 30:42.757
and, um, we're gonna try again
with the IVF.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.927
- Good, good.
Well, I'm rooting for you.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.096
- Thank you.
- Anyway, I just dropped by

30:48.179 --> 30:49.556
real quick to tell you
that Ava and I

30:49.639 --> 30:51.683
are actually
leaving on tour tonight.

30:51.766 --> 30:53.101
And I just wanted
to say goodbye.

30:53.184 --> 30:56.563
- Oh.
- Anyway, so while I'm gone,

30:56.646 --> 30:59.065
I would like you and Aidan
to stay at my house.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.650
- No, Mom,
I don't wanna stay--

31:00.733 --> 31:03.111
- Honey, listen, on a lot
of my tours you should've

31:03.194 --> 31:04.404
had a home that wasn't a bus.

31:04.487 --> 31:08.408
So, please, take it.

31:10.159 --> 31:13.329
Just until you get
a bigger place.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.499
- Thank you.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.084
Is there anything
you want me to do for you

31:18.167 --> 31:19.210
around the house
while you're gone?

31:19.294 --> 31:20.461
- Oh, no.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.255
I'd prefer you'd not
touch anything,

31:22.338 --> 31:28.595
but there is one thing
that you could help me with.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.001
- Okay, now we can go.
