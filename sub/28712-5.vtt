WEBVTT

00:02.210 --> 00:06.180
NARRATOR: Astonishing sea
creatures defy explanation.

00:06.300 --> 00:08.760
DAVID CHILDRESS:
It's like these creatures were

00:08.890 --> 00:12.430
brought here in their entirety
and put into our oceans.

00:12.560 --> 00:15.980
NARRATOR: Ancient cultures
worship fishlike gods.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.690
WILLIAM HENRY: This is a common
theme that we find around the world.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.770
Humans that had
aquatic features.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.110
NARRATOR:
Underwater life-forms display

00:24.240 --> 00:25.900
mysterious behavior.

00:26.030 --> 00:29.280
TOM ILIFFE: So they're
totally alien forms of life

00:29.410 --> 00:32.700
that have never been found
anywhere else on the planet.

00:32.830 --> 00:36.160
NARRATOR: Scientists say we know
more about the surface of Mars

00:36.290 --> 00:39.080
than we do about the bottom
of our own oceans.

00:39.210 --> 00:43.130
But is it an even more
alien environment

00:43.250 --> 00:45.340
than anyone could imagine?

00:45.460 --> 00:47.800
This is a extraterrestrial
amino acid, I would say.

00:47.930 --> 00:53.100
Really? This is a
revolutionary discovery.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.140
This could just be
the opening of the door

00:55.270 --> 00:58.140
into the realization
that our oceans

00:58.270 --> 01:00.650
are in fact a great
extraterrestrial laboratory.

01:05.690 --> 01:07.650
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:07.780 --> 01:10.360
in the universe.

01:10.490 --> 01:14.410
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:14.540 --> 01:17.370
It demands
we question everything

01:17.500 --> 01:19.710
we have ever been taught.

01:19.830 --> 01:23.170
The evidence is all around us.

01:23.290 --> 01:27.340
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.720
We are not alone.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.010
We have never <i>been</i> alone.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.530
NARRATOR:
November 4, 2006.

01:46.650 --> 01:50.200
A video is anonymously posted
on the Internet

01:50.320 --> 01:52.570
that appears to be
underwater footage

01:52.700 --> 01:55.950
of a large, shadowy
sea creature.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.500
While the footage
is low quality,

01:58.620 --> 02:02.630
long arms and legs,
or possibly a mermaid-like fin,

02:02.750 --> 02:06.210
can be made out as the creature
draws nearer to the camera,

02:06.340 --> 02:10.800
and then the video
abruptly ends.

02:10.919 --> 02:16.260
Information posted with the clip
claims it shows the Ningen,

02:16.390 --> 02:18.770
a legendary sea creature
said to lurk

02:18.890 --> 02:20.890
off the coast of Antarctica.

02:21.020 --> 02:24.400
While some suggest
the footage was faked,

02:24.520 --> 02:26.690
other photos and videos
of the Ningen

02:26.820 --> 02:29.150
have surfaced in recent years,

02:29.280 --> 02:31.450
and there are those who believe

02:31.570 --> 02:35.320
this disturbingly humanlike
sea monster is real.

02:35.450 --> 02:37.830
JASON MARTELL: Now most people,
when they saw the images of this Ningen,

02:37.950 --> 02:39.790
quickly dismissed it as a hoax,

02:39.910 --> 02:42.750
but things in the past, too,
like the idea of a Kraken...

02:42.870 --> 02:45.500
Some large squid... was never
even thought possible

02:45.630 --> 02:47.380
until it was discovered.

02:47.500 --> 02:51.340
NARRATOR: History books are
filled with sensational encounters

02:51.470 --> 02:53.680
with terrifying sea monsters.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.430
Many of these stories
were derided as myth

02:56.550 --> 02:59.720
until evidence was found
centuries after

02:59.850 --> 03:03.230
to indicate there was
some truth to them.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.270
JONATHAN YOUNG:
The sea is a primal force.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.230
It is deep, it is powerful,

03:07.360 --> 03:09.730
it is tempestuous,
so it frightens us.

03:09.860 --> 03:14.450
So mariners' tales of sea
serpents, sea monsters go back

03:14.570 --> 03:18.200
to the earliest times
of mythology and folklore.

03:18.330 --> 03:21.540
They represent some
of our deepest terrors.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.710
NICK POPE:
The ocean is a good example

03:25.830 --> 03:27.880
of this fact
meets fiction scenario.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.550
You have stories like the Kraken

03:30.670 --> 03:32.840
and these giant sea monsters.

03:32.970 --> 03:36.010
And then the science
catches up, so to speak,

03:36.140 --> 03:39.680
and we find that, yes, there are
these giant squid down there.

03:39.810 --> 03:42.390
So that begs the question,
what else might be down there?

03:42.520 --> 03:44.480
And, frankly,
we haven't got a clue.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.940
HENRY: As we venture deeper
and deeper into the ocean,

03:50.070 --> 03:52.570
there's no telling
what we're gonna find,

03:52.690 --> 03:54.610
but one thing will be certain:

03:54.740 --> 03:57.320
It will be absolutely
mind-blowing.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.910
NARRATOR: Could the Ningen and
other even more incredible creatures

04:03.040 --> 04:04.830
that we have yet to encounter

04:04.960 --> 04:08.210
be hiding out in the depths
of Earth's oceans?

04:08.330 --> 04:13.760
Incredibly, the world that we
know and inhabit, above water,

04:13.880 --> 04:17.970
represents only one percent
of the planet's livable space.

04:18.089 --> 04:23.270
99% belongs to the oceans,

04:23.390 --> 04:27.350
and less than ten percent of
that space has been explored.

04:29.730 --> 04:32.820
KIRSTEN FISHER: The ocean does
represent probably the last real, like,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.440
unexplored area of the Earth.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.280
Uh, the surface
of the ocean floor

04:37.400 --> 04:39.360
is largely uncharacterized.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.910
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: It's kind
of strange when you think about it

04:44.040 --> 04:46.000
because we know more

04:46.120 --> 04:49.830
about the surface of the Moon
and the surface of Mars

04:49.960 --> 04:52.040
than we know
about the ocean floors.

04:52.170 --> 04:55.590
NARRATOR:
Up until 1875,

04:55.710 --> 04:57.880
the mainstream
scientific viewpoint

04:58.010 --> 05:00.720
was that living organisms
could not exist

05:00.840 --> 05:04.140
more than 1800 feet beneath
the surface of the ocean.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.310
But then a scientific expedition

05:07.430 --> 05:10.440
discovered over 4,700
new types of sea life

05:10.560 --> 05:13.020
beneath that depth.

05:13.150 --> 05:15.190
And an even more
remarkable discovery

05:15.320 --> 05:18.820
would be made more than
100 years later.

05:21.990 --> 05:25.040
February 1977.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.710
250 miles northeast
of the Galápagos Islands.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.250
Scientists make
a remarkable discovery

05:33.380 --> 05:36.920
more than 8,000 feet
below the surface...

05:37.050 --> 05:41.010
near a hydrothermal vent
in the ocean floor

05:41.130 --> 05:45.140
where no life
is thought to exist.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.890
To their astonishment,

05:47.020 --> 05:50.190
the area is teeming
with creatures unlike anything

05:50.310 --> 05:53.190
ever witnessed on Earth.

05:53.310 --> 05:56.570
ILIFFE: When they first came
upon these deep sea vents,

05:56.690 --> 05:59.700
they found giant
tube worms, <i>Riftia,</i>

05:59.820 --> 06:02.870
that are amazing size

06:02.990 --> 06:05.280
and beautifully colored,

06:05.410 --> 06:08.700
all sorts of shrimp

06:08.830 --> 06:11.960
and crabs and fish
living around these vents.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.840
So they're totally
alien forms of life

06:15.960 --> 06:19.010
that have never been found
anywhere else on the planet.

06:19.130 --> 06:22.680
NARRATOR: Central to
the underwater ecosystem

06:22.800 --> 06:25.470
is an unusual food source.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.060
FISHER: Bacteria exists
at these vent sites.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.640
In the absence of light, they do
something that's analogous

06:30.770 --> 06:34.020
to photosynthesis
that we call chemosynthesis.

06:34.150 --> 06:36.060
They actually take these
sulfur-containing compounds

06:36.190 --> 06:38.780
to generate their energy
for their cells, essentially.

06:38.900 --> 06:43.160
NARRATOR: The discovery transforms
the field of marine biology.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.780
Considering the fact that
these extraordinary creatures

06:46.910 --> 06:50.160
have been found,
is it also possible

06:50.290 --> 06:52.920
that so-called sea monsters
presumed to be mythological,

06:53.040 --> 06:55.080
such as the
Ningen of Antarctica,

06:55.210 --> 06:57.920
could exist as well?

06:58.050 --> 07:00.380
While no physical evidence
of the Ningen

07:00.510 --> 07:02.050
has come to light yet,

07:02.170 --> 07:05.180
there is proof of an equally
mystifying creature

07:05.300 --> 07:06.890
that lurks in the depths:

07:07.010 --> 07:12.390
<i>Turritopsis dohrnii,</i>
or the immortal jellyfish.

07:12.520 --> 07:16.770
The immortal jellyfish,
when conditions become adverse,

07:16.900 --> 07:19.860
maybe temperatures
become too high,

07:19.980 --> 07:22.440
salinity changes,

07:22.570 --> 07:26.910
these animals revert
to a juvenile stage

07:27.030 --> 07:28.870
from the adult stage

07:28.990 --> 07:33.580
and basically start life
all over again.

07:33.710 --> 07:37.130
So it basically just keeps r...
rewinding its development

07:37.250 --> 07:38.960
over and over again.

07:39.090 --> 07:41.340
In the lab, there are some lines
of immortal jellyfish

07:41.460 --> 07:43.090
that haven't
experienced death yet,

07:43.220 --> 07:44.550
um, they've just been cycling

07:44.680 --> 07:46.720
through their developmental
stages repeatedly.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.390
NARRATOR: A jellyfish that has
the potential to live forever?

07:50.510 --> 07:53.850
But how is it possible that
a creature could exist on Earth

07:53.980 --> 07:57.770
that is so unlike any other
life-form yet discovered,

07:57.900 --> 08:02.030
and that scientists
still struggle to explain?

08:02.150 --> 08:05.110
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest there could be

08:05.240 --> 08:09.240
a very simple answer:
That the immortal jellyfish,

08:09.370 --> 08:11.830
and perhaps other bizarre
creatures of the deep,

08:11.950 --> 08:17.460
are not native to this planet,
but arrived here from space.

08:17.580 --> 08:22.250
On August 19, 2014,

08:22.380 --> 08:25.470
Russian cosmonauts aboard
the International Space Station

08:25.590 --> 08:27.550
made an incredible discovery.

08:27.680 --> 08:30.300
Clinging to the exterior
of the windows

08:30.430 --> 08:33.640
was an organism
commonly found underwater:

08:33.770 --> 08:36.980
Sea plankton.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.650
CHANDRA WICKRAMASINGHE:
Recent findings of sea plankton

08:40.770 --> 08:42.820
on the outside
of the space station

08:42.940 --> 08:44.690
is really very interesting.

08:44.820 --> 08:47.780
I, personally, have collaborated
with the group

08:47.900 --> 08:50.870
of very distinguished scientists
who are involved in this,

08:50.990 --> 08:54.120
and we concluded
that there's no way

08:54.240 --> 08:58.920
in which microbes can be lofted
to 400 kilometers

08:59.040 --> 09:02.750
from the surface, so they
have to come from outside.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.130
NARRATOR:
Has Dr. Chandra Wickramasinghe,

09:07.260 --> 09:10.260
along with his colleagues,
found irrefutable evidence

09:10.390 --> 09:12.800
of alien life
that is able to survive

09:12.930 --> 09:15.100
the extreme conditions
of outer space

09:15.220 --> 09:18.310
and potentially travel to Earth?

09:18.440 --> 09:21.980
And could the fact that it
was found to be plankton

09:22.110 --> 09:24.730
indicate that life-forms
coming from space

09:24.860 --> 09:27.320
are capable of surviving
in Earth's oceans?

09:29.280 --> 09:32.030
TSOUKALOS: Here's what's so
crazy, we've discovered

09:32.160 --> 09:37.200
new creatures and new species
in places where, 20 years ago,

09:37.330 --> 09:39.620
it was scientific fact

09:39.750 --> 09:43.750
that no life could exist
in those places.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.550
We now have even found fish

09:45.670 --> 09:50.300
at the bottom of the
deepest spots of the ocean

09:50.430 --> 09:53.050
where even a submarine
could get crushed,

09:53.180 --> 09:56.970
and there's living fish down
there, how is that possible?

09:57.100 --> 09:59.890
It shouldn't work on Earth,
but it does,

10:00.020 --> 10:03.520
so my question is:
Are some of those creatures

10:03.650 --> 10:06.360
directly imported
from somewhere else?

10:08.280 --> 10:10.070
NARRATOR:
Immortal jellyfish.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.280
Giant worms.

10:12.410 --> 10:15.200
Possible humanoid sea monsters.

10:15.330 --> 10:18.370
Might the many bizarre
creatures found

10:18.500 --> 10:23.710
in Earth's oceans
not be from Earth at all?

10:23.830 --> 10:27.130
And if alien life-forms
really do inhabit our seas,

10:27.250 --> 10:29.800
did they arrive here
by accident?

10:29.920 --> 10:32.550
Or were they sent here
deliberately

10:32.680 --> 10:35.760
as part of an
extraterrestrial agenda?

10:35.890 --> 10:40.350
Perhaps further clues can be
found by examining an object

10:40.480 --> 10:43.230
that recently
crash-landed on Earth

10:43.350 --> 10:46.900
carrying cargo that has the
potential to create life.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.740
NARRATOR:
December 1974.

10:57.870 --> 11:00.750
Cambridge University
Professor of Astronomy,

11:00.870 --> 11:04.540
Dr. Chandra Wickramasinghe,
publishes an article

11:04.670 --> 11:09.590
in <i>Nature</i> magazine that sets
the scientific community abuzz.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.300
For decades,

11:12.420 --> 11:15.010
the mainstream viewpoint
has been that life on Earth

11:15.140 --> 11:19.260
spontaneously arose from
a so-called "primordial soup,"

11:19.390 --> 11:23.480
or organic compounds in the
planet's primitive oceans.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.230
But scientists
are still uncertain

11:26.350 --> 11:29.320
as to just how life would've
been able to develop

11:29.440 --> 11:31.900
from inanimate matter.

11:32.030 --> 11:35.860
Instead,
Dr. Wickramasinghe suggests

11:35.990 --> 11:38.870
that life didn't start
on Earth at all,

11:38.990 --> 11:41.200
but was delivered to our planet

11:41.330 --> 11:44.870
on meteorites and comets.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.340
The concept is known
as "panspermia."

11:48.460 --> 11:51.090
Every single textbook on biology

11:51.210 --> 11:55.090
that, uh, we would've studied
maybe ten, 20 years ago

11:55.220 --> 12:00.180
starts with the story
of the primordial soup.

12:00.310 --> 12:03.350
There is no evidence
for this at all,

12:03.480 --> 12:06.940
and so the alternative
to the primordial soup theory

12:07.060 --> 12:10.020
is that life did not start here
on the Earth,

12:10.150 --> 12:11.570
but came from outside.

12:13.740 --> 12:16.400
TSOUKALOS: There are
two types of panspermia:

12:16.530 --> 12:20.080
One which is just panspermia,
which suggests

12:20.200 --> 12:23.870
that life was carried
on the backs of comets

12:24.000 --> 12:25.790
throughout the universe.

12:25.910 --> 12:29.290
So it's a natural seeding
of the planets.

12:29.420 --> 12:31.460
Now, the second term
is what's called

12:31.590 --> 12:36.720
directed panspermia and
the definition behind that is

12:36.840 --> 12:39.840
that an intelligent
technological species

12:39.970 --> 12:41.970
on a distant planet

12:42.100 --> 12:45.600
deliberately sent out
building blocks of life

12:45.730 --> 12:49.980
to particular planets,
so the idea is

12:50.110 --> 12:53.230
that Earth, perhaps,
a long time ago,

12:53.360 --> 12:56.280
was seeded by extraterrestrials.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.530
NARRATOR: For decades,
mainstream scientists

13:00.660 --> 13:04.040
have dismissed the theory
of panspermia on the basis

13:04.160 --> 13:08.580
that life could not survive
the extreme conditions of space.

13:08.710 --> 13:12.130
But a recent discovery
could prove that notion wrong,

13:12.250 --> 13:14.590
and possibly provide
physical evidence

13:14.710 --> 13:17.630
that panspermia
not only occurred,

13:17.760 --> 13:20.510
but continues
to affect life on Earth.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.180
Milton Keynes, England.

13:28.310 --> 13:30.900
March 2019.

13:31.020 --> 13:35.610
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

13:35.730 --> 13:38.030
travels to The Open University

13:38.150 --> 13:41.240
to meet with planetary scientist
Dr. Queenie Chan.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.070
Dr. Chan?

13:43.200 --> 13:44.950
- Giorgio!
- Hello.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.450
- Great pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome here.

13:46.580 --> 13:47.870
Nice to meet you, too. Welcome.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.620
Thank you so much
for bringing me here.

13:49.750 --> 13:52.460
NARRATOR:
Dr. Chan recently analyzed

13:52.580 --> 13:55.920
two meteorites recovered in 1998

13:56.050 --> 13:58.670
and discovered something
incredibly unexpected,

13:58.800 --> 14:03.970
a salt crystal
containing liquid water.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.140
Giorgio is eager to find out

14:06.260 --> 14:09.140
what the implications
of this discovery could be,

14:09.270 --> 14:12.480
and if it might provide further
evidence that life on Earth

14:12.600 --> 14:16.520
was seeded by extraterrestrials.

14:16.650 --> 14:18.650
So here we've got a box

14:18.780 --> 14:21.320
full of heavy meteorites.
(chuckles)

14:21.450 --> 14:22.990
Oh, wow.

14:23.110 --> 14:26.280
Within a stony meteorite,
we've got something called

14:26.410 --> 14:29.370
the chondritic meteorite.
They are interesting because

14:29.500 --> 14:31.580
they have
organic materials in it.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.090
The meteorite that I found

14:35.210 --> 14:38.800
extremely interesting,
uh, special,

14:38.920 --> 14:42.260
two meteorites, actually...
Zag and Monahans meteorite.

14:42.380 --> 14:45.220
They are both
ordinary chondrites,

14:45.350 --> 14:47.560
but they are not ordinary.
(chuckles)

14:49.310 --> 14:53.060
They both fell to Earth in 1998.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.610
And what's more interesting is,

14:55.730 --> 14:58.610
both of these meteorite
has salt crystal,

14:58.730 --> 15:02.110
that stunning blue
coloration to them.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.910
More interesting is,
within this salt crystals,

15:06.030 --> 15:07.370
we found water,

15:07.490 --> 15:10.950
liquid water inclusion
within them.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.830
I'm trying to wrap my mind
around this.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.290
So you're telling me

15:14.420 --> 15:16.170
that you found meteorites
that actually contain

15:16.290 --> 15:19.250
liquid water in them.
What would you say

15:19.380 --> 15:21.210
to someone who would argue
that maybe

15:21.340 --> 15:23.430
the water entered the meteorite

15:23.550 --> 15:25.180
- after it fell on Earth?
- We were lucky

15:25.300 --> 15:28.300
because they both fell
in a dry condition,

15:28.430 --> 15:30.600
and they were retrieved
really quickly

15:30.720 --> 15:32.770
once they...
We observed the fall.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.940
So it was not contaminated
by the rain.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.940
Okay.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.480
Should we have a look at it
in the clean lab?

15:38.610 --> 15:40.020
Yes, please,
that would be amazing.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.860
NARRATOR:
Before they can examine

15:44.990 --> 15:48.910
the meteorite sample,
Giorgio and Dr. Chan change

15:49.030 --> 15:51.080
into protective gear that will
keep the laboratory sterile.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.960
All right.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.420
- And so this is it?
- This is it.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.460
- Should we have a look under the microscope?
- Yes, please, yes.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.550
Trying to move that
in focus now.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.850
There it is.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.640
I'm going to enlarge it
on my screen.

16:13.770 --> 16:17.980
This is it. You're looking at
a speck of water in a meteorite.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.650
This is the first time
that we've found

16:19.770 --> 16:22.570
amino acids with water.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.440
This is extraordinary.

16:24.570 --> 16:27.860
NARRATOR:
Amino acids?

16:27.990 --> 16:31.490
These organic compounds
are the building blocks of life,

16:31.620 --> 16:33.450
so finding them
within liquid water

16:33.580 --> 16:36.830
on a meteorite is extraordinary.

16:36.960 --> 16:41.670
Could alien proteins like these
have started life on Earth?

16:44.010 --> 16:45.760
One of the exciting things
about the discovery

16:45.880 --> 16:48.680
of the blue salt crystals in the
asteroids that crashed to Earth

16:48.800 --> 16:51.550
is really the amino acids.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.970
Amino acids are the
building block of protein,

16:54.100 --> 16:57.810
and so it really shows that
Earth isn't the only place

16:57.940 --> 17:01.980
where the right chemistry exists
for which you can get life.

17:02.110 --> 17:06.650
MICHIO KAKU: The panspermia
theory cannot be dismissed,

17:06.780 --> 17:10.660
and one reason is as follows:
In the early Earth, we were hit

17:10.780 --> 17:12.490
by meteors and asteroids,

17:12.619 --> 17:16.200
so our oceans probably boiled
off many times in the past,

17:16.329 --> 17:19.290
making life impossible.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.670
But then when the
solar system became quiet

17:22.790 --> 17:25.800
and we had oceans... boom...
Life gets off the ground.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.760
NARRATOR: Scientists are
finding more and more evidence

17:29.880 --> 17:31.890
that shows organic material
arrived here

17:32.010 --> 17:34.850
from other worlds
billions of years ago,

17:34.970 --> 17:38.520
and some believe that process
continues to this day.

17:38.640 --> 17:39.850
What is this?

17:39.980 --> 17:41.940
- This is a NanoSIMS.
- Okay.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.900
It's capable of doing
isotopic analysis.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.610
NARRATOR:
In another laboratory,

17:46.730 --> 17:49.450
Dr. Chan shows Giorgio
the machine that analyzed

17:49.570 --> 17:53.580
the meteorite samples
on a nanometer scale.

17:53.700 --> 17:56.790
The results are then displayed
on a computer screen,

17:56.910 --> 17:58.960
showing a comparison
between amino acids

17:59.080 --> 18:02.710
found on Earth and those
that arrived here from space.

18:02.830 --> 18:06.210
This is very interesting,
because, uh, first of all,

18:06.340 --> 18:08.010
we're seeing
a bunch of amino acids

18:08.130 --> 18:11.590
that are common
in-in terrestrial life,

18:11.720 --> 18:13.890
and over here, we've got
other extraterrestrial

18:14.010 --> 18:15.720
- amino acid inside.
- Really?

18:15.850 --> 18:19.140
This is a revolutionary
discovery.

18:19.270 --> 18:24.190
I immediately go to the idea
of panspermia... that life

18:24.310 --> 18:28.650
has been brought throughout
the entire galaxy by means

18:28.780 --> 18:31.900
with which we can't even fathom
how it was done.

18:32.030 --> 18:33.870
The building blocks of protein

18:33.990 --> 18:36.990
that we know to be necessary
for life, these very

18:37.120 --> 18:39.790
building blocks, the same amino
acids that we found on Earth,

18:39.910 --> 18:42.500
is ubiquitous in the,
in the universe.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.920
It's everywhere.
It's found on-on asteroid.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.840
It's found on-on comets, too.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.760
So, in your estimation,
what is the likelihood

18:49.880 --> 18:53.840
of life having begun elsewhere?

18:53.970 --> 18:56.300
We've got so many
different galaxies

18:56.430 --> 18:57.970
and there are so many
Earth-like planets,

18:58.100 --> 19:02.060
and, uh, we-we could
have water elsewhere.

19:02.190 --> 19:04.440
We-we know that amino acids,
the building blocks of life,

19:04.560 --> 19:05.810
are ubiquitous,

19:05.940 --> 19:09.360
um, so I think it-it's
totally possible.

19:11.030 --> 19:15.240
Thank you so much for sharing
this information with me.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.200
I think this has been
one of the most enlightening

19:17.330 --> 19:18.620
conversations
that I've ever had.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.750
- So thank you for your time.
- Thank you very much.

19:20.870 --> 19:22.290
- Yup. Good to have you here.
- Thank you. All right.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.880
NARRATOR: Are the seeds of
life being sent to Earth

19:28.000 --> 19:31.010
inside meteorites
and possibly developing

19:31.130 --> 19:33.470
new alien species
in the deepest parts

19:33.590 --> 19:34.880
of our oceans?

19:35.010 --> 19:36.930
And if so,

19:37.050 --> 19:39.310
to what end?

19:39.430 --> 19:41.720
Perhaps further clues
can be found

19:41.850 --> 19:45.650
by examining one of the most
mysterious and intelligent

19:45.770 --> 19:47.270
creatures in the sea:

19:47.400 --> 19:49.270
The octopus.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.320
NARRATOR:
March 2018.

19:58.450 --> 20:02.700
A scientific paper sparks
a sensation in the press.

20:02.830 --> 20:05.710
In it, a team of 33 scientists,

20:05.830 --> 20:08.750
including
Dr. Chandra Wickramasinghe,

20:08.880 --> 20:13.720
claim that octopuses
possess extraterrestrial DNA.

20:13.840 --> 20:18.430
What we find in the octopus
genome is just almost uncanny.

20:21.060 --> 20:25.690
It has something like
50,000 genes.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.770
Compare that with the human,

20:27.900 --> 20:30.860
which has something like
25,000 genes.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.280
So the octopus, in many ways,

20:33.400 --> 20:37.070
appears to be more complex
than the human.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.740
Now how did this complexity
manifest itself?

20:39.870 --> 20:41.870
There's ample evidence
to suggest

20:41.990 --> 20:43.660
that it came from outside.

20:43.790 --> 20:46.660
CHILDRESS:
As scientists study octopi,

20:46.790 --> 20:50.130
they're amazed at what they're
finding, and they're not seeing

20:50.250 --> 20:53.920
a connection
to some ancestor of the octopi.

20:54.050 --> 20:57.720
It's like these creatures were
brought here, in their entirety,

20:57.840 --> 20:59.720
and put into our oceans.

20:59.840 --> 21:04.180
FISHER: The octopus is a
really fascinating organism.

21:04.310 --> 21:07.140
The octopus's brain,
instead of just being centered

21:07.270 --> 21:11.020
in its head like ours,
is actually distributed.

21:11.150 --> 21:13.650
And there are these brains
in their arms,

21:13.780 --> 21:15.610
as well as the essential brain
in their head.

21:15.740 --> 21:19.070
ILIFFE:
An octopus can certainly

21:19.200 --> 21:21.450
manipulate its environment.

21:21.570 --> 21:23.370
It builds its own homes

21:23.490 --> 21:27.500
by piling rocks and shells
on top of it.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.000
FISHER: Octopuses are very
adept at camouflaging themselves

21:34.130 --> 21:37.170
by changing their color
to that of their surroundings.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.300
Really, really quickly,
I mean, almost...

21:38.420 --> 21:40.050
It looks instantaneous to us.

21:40.180 --> 21:43.100
It can also manipulate its body
into different shapes

21:43.220 --> 21:45.680
to imitate other animals.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.600
NARRATOR:
Some scientists have speculated

21:50.730 --> 21:51.980
that in the absence of humans,

21:52.100 --> 21:54.520
the animal best suited to evolve

21:54.650 --> 21:56.900
into the dominant species
on the planet

21:57.030 --> 22:00.360
is not another primate,
but the octopus.

22:00.490 --> 22:03.410
And there is one ability
in particular

22:03.530 --> 22:07.790
that suggests the octopus
could one day rule the Earth:

22:07.910 --> 22:11.960
It can edit
its own genetic code.

22:12.080 --> 22:16.630
ILIFFE: DNA, the double
helix, is like a zipper.

22:16.750 --> 22:20.220
The zipper can be unzipped,

22:20.340 --> 22:23.760
and then another molecule
is created,

22:23.890 --> 22:26.510
called RNA.

22:26.640 --> 22:30.480
RNA, it transfers
the information

22:30.600 --> 22:33.690
from DNA to proteins.

22:35.360 --> 22:39.110
So the octopus have
the amazing ability

22:39.240 --> 22:45.160
to edit their RNA, thus,
they can make new proteins.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.870
NARRATOR: Although this
ability isn't fully understood,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.920
it suggests that the octopus can
rapidly adapt to its environment

22:53.040 --> 22:55.630
far faster than other creatures.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.210
FISHER: What RNA editing
does is essentially

22:58.340 --> 22:59.800
mediated by changes
in the environment,

22:59.920 --> 23:01.880
usually temperature,
for example.

23:02.010 --> 23:05.800
NARRATOR:
Camouflaging skin?

23:05.930 --> 23:08.720
Tool use?

23:08.850 --> 23:12.350
The ability to edit
its own genetic code?

23:12.480 --> 23:15.730
Is it possible that this
extraordinary creature,

23:15.860 --> 23:20.190
with three hearts and nine
brains, is not from Earth?

23:20.320 --> 23:24.070
Perhaps evidence can be found by
examining mythological accounts

23:24.200 --> 23:27.280
from across the ancient world.

23:27.410 --> 23:31.700
Numerous cultures told stories
of humanlike beings

23:31.830 --> 23:33.870
coming out of the ocean,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.380
and worshiped gods
that resembled sea creatures.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.920
Interestingly, a great many
of these aquatic deities

23:41.050 --> 23:43.510
resemble the octopus.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.180
All the way round the world,
there are traditions

23:46.300 --> 23:49.890
to do with a creator god
in the form of an octopus.

23:50.010 --> 23:54.640
For instance, in ancient Crete,
there are numerous

23:54.770 --> 23:58.440
images and paintings
of an octopus

23:58.560 --> 24:02.030
with bizarre, large eyes.

24:03.740 --> 24:07.070
In Ecuador,
at a place called Manta,

24:07.200 --> 24:12.950
were these bas-relief carvings
of this bizarre octopus deity.

24:13.080 --> 24:17.790
We have to ask ourselves, is it
possible that the ancients

24:17.920 --> 24:23.170
were aware that the octopus
is truly alien to this planet?

24:23.300 --> 24:27.390
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the octopus is related

24:27.510 --> 24:30.100
to a race of extraterrestrials
that visited Earth

24:30.220 --> 24:32.220
thousands of years ago?

24:32.350 --> 24:35.480
Or did our ancestors encounter
intelligent creatures

24:35.600 --> 24:38.810
that were the result
of alien experimentation?

24:38.940 --> 24:42.070
Ancient astronaut theory
proposes

24:42.190 --> 24:44.690
that in the distant past,
the human race

24:44.820 --> 24:48.410
was genetically modified
by otherworldly beings.

24:48.530 --> 24:53.120
If true, could they have altered
other creatures as well?

24:53.240 --> 24:55.160
HENRY: In the ancient
record in mythology,

24:55.290 --> 24:58.960
we find a very intriguing story,
and that is,

24:59.080 --> 25:00.880
the gods experimented

25:01.000 --> 25:03.130
when they were coming up
with the human form.

25:03.250 --> 25:06.800
They experimented with various
types of creatures:

25:06.920 --> 25:10.390
Half human, half dog hybrids,

25:10.510 --> 25:12.970
half human, half horse hybrids,

25:13.100 --> 25:16.100
humans that had
aquatic features.

25:16.230 --> 25:19.400
They seemed to be
experimenting and looking

25:19.520 --> 25:24.780
for just the right fit
for conditions of life on Earth.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.740
We think that stopped,
but that may not be true.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.700
NARRATOR:
Are extraterrestrials

25:31.820 --> 25:35.120
continuing to introduce
new life-forms to planet Earth,

25:35.240 --> 25:38.790
and perhaps altering existing
life-forms to this day?

25:38.910 --> 25:41.420
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

25:41.540 --> 25:43.590
that, just like we are
conducting research

25:43.710 --> 25:45.460
on other planets,

25:45.590 --> 25:48.550
otherworldly beings
may be using our oceans

25:48.670 --> 25:52.140
as their own
research laboratory.

25:58.560 --> 26:02.900
NARRATOR:
St. George's, Bermuda, 1978.

26:03.020 --> 26:06.530
Dr. Tom Iliffe,
a research scientist

26:06.650 --> 26:09.200
at the Bermuda
Biological Station,

26:09.320 --> 26:13.740
begins to explore the dozens
of underwater caves in the area.

26:13.870 --> 26:17.290
Many of his colleagues tell him
that he is wasting his time,

26:17.410 --> 26:19.330
that no meaningful life
can survive

26:19.460 --> 26:22.830
in the dense saltwater
environments of these caves...

26:22.960 --> 26:27.210
Caves where the sunlight
does not reach.

26:27.340 --> 26:29.300
But to his astonishment,

26:29.420 --> 26:33.300
he finds the caves
teeming with life.

26:33.430 --> 26:36.890
The blue holes are the
underwater caves in the Bahamas.

26:37.010 --> 26:40.940
So they're called blue holes
because they're vertical shafts.

26:41.060 --> 26:46.110
When you look at them, the water
is a deep, dark blue in color,

26:46.230 --> 26:48.320
crystal clear water.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.030
There have been a number
of people who have said,

26:51.150 --> 26:53.700
"There's nothing
interesting there,

26:53.820 --> 26:57.950
don't even bother to look,"
but I took that as a challenge.

26:58.080 --> 27:03.250
I went ahead and tried to find
out for myself what was there,

27:03.370 --> 27:06.540
and amazingly, there's just over

27:06.670 --> 27:10.630
350 new species of animals

27:10.760 --> 27:13.010
that I have found in my career.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.970
We know of more animals
in these caves

27:16.100 --> 27:18.260
than any other place
in the world.

27:18.390 --> 27:22.100
NARRATOR: Not only has Dr. Iliffe
discovered an amazing amount

27:22.230 --> 27:25.650
of life within the extreme
environment of the blue holes,

27:25.770 --> 27:27.520
but the life-forms he has found

27:27.650 --> 27:31.740
are unlike any other creatures
on Earth.

27:31.860 --> 27:35.530
There have been discovered
an enormous variety

27:35.660 --> 27:41.080
of higher groups of animals
in these underwater caves.

27:41.200 --> 27:43.830
One of the most interesting
animals we worked on

27:43.960 --> 27:47.590
represents a new class
of crustacea.

27:47.710 --> 27:51.170
It's called the remipedes,
and they're unusual

27:51.300 --> 27:53.470
because they are
the only crustacean

27:53.590 --> 27:57.050
with venom-injecting fangs.

27:57.180 --> 28:00.510
So they swim up to prey,
maybe a small shrimp,

28:00.640 --> 28:04.060
and stick their fangs into it,

28:04.190 --> 28:08.310
inject it with hydrolytic
enzymes that paralyzes

28:08.440 --> 28:12.320
and begins digesting
the shrimp externally,

28:12.440 --> 28:15.650
and then literally have the
ability to suck the juices out

28:15.780 --> 28:18.780
of their prey.

28:18.910 --> 28:22.240
If I were going to build
a science fiction monster,

28:22.370 --> 28:24.960
I'd build it around a remipede.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.750
NARRATOR: While scientists are
fascinated by the incredible abilities

28:28.880 --> 28:32.380
of the octopus that they still
don't fully understand,

28:32.500 --> 28:34.880
it is only one
of literally thousands

28:35.010 --> 28:39.550
of extraordinary sea creatures
that similarly defy explanation.

28:39.680 --> 28:43.810
And one of them,
discovered in 2013,

28:43.930 --> 28:48.150
is the octopus's colossal
cousin, the giant squid.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.530
Once thought to be
a mythological creature,

28:54.650 --> 28:58.570
the giant squid can grow
to over 40 feet in length,

28:58.700 --> 29:00.990
weigh up to 600 pounds

29:01.120 --> 29:04.290
and boasts the animal kingdom's
largest eyes...

29:04.410 --> 29:06.210
Eyes capable of accommodating

29:06.330 --> 29:08.790
the lack of sunlight
in the deep.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.210
So <i>Architeuthis dux,</i>
or the giant squid,

29:11.340 --> 29:14.550
is a really interesting creature
in that it's experiencing,

29:14.670 --> 29:18.220
like, deep-sea gigantism, so it
can get really, really large,

29:18.340 --> 29:20.760
in the deep-sea environment.

29:20.890 --> 29:23.220
The giant squid's tentacles
are covered with suction cups

29:23.350 --> 29:26.390
that have little teeth,
and so that allows it

29:26.520 --> 29:30.850
to grab its prey in the dark
and pull it to them.

29:34.570 --> 29:37.990
NARRATOR: Perhaps the strangest
of all the sea creatures found

29:38.110 --> 29:41.410
in the past 20 years
is the ctenophore,

29:41.530 --> 29:43.910
or comb jelly.

29:44.030 --> 29:46.950
It has two neurosystems,

29:47.080 --> 29:50.040
heals from any wound in under
three hours with no scarring,

29:50.170 --> 29:54.170
and can even regenerate
its own brain.

29:54.300 --> 29:56.840
Comb jellies are such
a mystery to scientists,

29:56.960 --> 29:59.970
they have been dubbed
"aliens of the sea."

30:00.090 --> 30:04.180
But as bizarre
as all these creatures are,

30:04.310 --> 30:06.810
could there be even more
incredible life-forms

30:06.930 --> 30:10.140
we have yet to discover?

30:10.270 --> 30:14.270
Exploration of the deep ocean
is very difficult and dangerous.

30:14.400 --> 30:18.780
In some respects,
a space mission is easier.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.410
The pressures crush

30:21.530 --> 30:25.120
most conventional submarines
and submersibles.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.490
There are only a handful
of missions that have gone,

30:27.620 --> 30:31.330
say, to the very bottom
of the deep parts of the ocean,

30:31.460 --> 30:33.380
like the Mariana Trench.

30:35.460 --> 30:39.050
The deepest part of these oceans
are about seven miles deep,

30:39.170 --> 30:41.300
and you need special
bathyspheres or submarines

30:41.430 --> 30:42.890
to go that deep.

30:43.010 --> 30:46.600
And when researchers
do make these journeys,

30:46.720 --> 30:49.220
they're amazed to find
that there's actually life

30:49.350 --> 30:53.270
at these extreme depths,
something they didn't expect.

30:53.400 --> 30:55.860
So now we have to wonder,

30:55.980 --> 30:59.740
is it possible that, at these
extreme depths in our oceans,

30:59.860 --> 31:02.820
there are extraterrestrials
and bases?

31:02.950 --> 31:05.490
It's an incredible thought.

31:05.620 --> 31:09.040
NARRATOR: Could it be
that humanity's inability

31:09.160 --> 31:13.420
to fully explore Earth's oceans
has prevented the discovery

31:13.540 --> 31:18.250
of a profound and potentially
disturbing reality:

31:18.380 --> 31:20.960
That alien creatures
from other worlds

31:21.090 --> 31:23.840
not only can and do exist,

31:23.970 --> 31:27.300
but they are most likely
thriving in our oceans?

31:27.430 --> 31:31.600
Not only do many ancient
astronaut theorists say yes,

31:31.730 --> 31:34.230
they also suggest
that not all alien life-forms

31:34.350 --> 31:38.020
are of the silent,
swimming variety.

31:38.150 --> 31:41.650
They believe that the sea
is vast enough and deep enough

31:41.780 --> 31:45.320
to hide entire colonies
of extraterrestrials,

31:45.450 --> 31:47.910
and some
with technological capabilities

31:48.030 --> 31:51.330
far surpassing our own.

31:58.210 --> 32:00.710
NARRATOR:
Malibu, California.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.420
2014.

32:03.550 --> 32:06.840
Satellite imagery reveals
a curious formation

32:06.970 --> 32:11.640
on the seabed
six miles off the coast.

32:11.770 --> 32:15.060
The satellite photos
show what seems to be, uh,

32:15.190 --> 32:18.810
an oval, flat-topped structure

32:18.940 --> 32:23.110
that's got legs coming down
that are holding it up.

32:23.240 --> 32:27.200
It's about
2,000 feet underwater.

32:27.320 --> 32:31.030
In some ways, this would look a
little bit like an oil platform.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.120
NARRATOR: In the very same area
as the underwater structure,

32:37.250 --> 32:39.750
locals have reported
seeing strange lights

32:39.880 --> 32:41.710
emerging from the ocean.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.920
BILL BIRNES: There is this
very strange 911 call

32:46.050 --> 32:48.840
from an observer
near Point Dume off Malibu,

32:48.970 --> 32:51.010
saying he saw a light coming out
of the water,

32:51.140 --> 32:53.180
and calling it in
to the sheriff's station.

32:53.310 --> 32:56.980
In Point Dume,
and the whole area around there,

32:57.100 --> 33:01.230
USOs are phenomenally common.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.980
A USO is an

33:04.110 --> 33:06.740
unidentified submersible object.

33:08.410 --> 33:11.160
Is there an alien base

33:11.280 --> 33:13.240
in a very deep trench

33:13.370 --> 33:16.080
off the coast of Malibu,
and that's why

33:16.210 --> 33:20.330
there are so many sightings
of USOs off that coast?

33:20.460 --> 33:24.250
NARRATOR:
An underwater alien base?

33:24.380 --> 33:28.590
Could such
an incredible notion be true?

33:28.720 --> 33:31.430
And if so, is this just one

33:31.550 --> 33:33.680
of many extraterrestrial
installations

33:33.810 --> 33:37.180
hidden deep
beneath Earth's oceans?

33:37.310 --> 33:40.600
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

33:40.730 --> 33:44.440
and point to stories
from all over the world of USOs.

33:47.030 --> 33:50.240
NOORY:
Witnesses have seen UFOs

33:50.360 --> 33:52.570
busting out from the ocean floor

33:52.700 --> 33:55.160
and just taking right off
into the atmosphere

33:55.290 --> 33:58.460
and gone, into space.

33:58.580 --> 34:02.290
BIRNES: You see them off
the coast of California.

34:02.420 --> 34:04.210
You see them a lot
in the Gulf of Mexico.

34:04.340 --> 34:07.670
Spend some time
on the Florida Gulf Coast,

34:07.800 --> 34:09.719
you will see a USO.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.260
NOORY:
Sailors have seen lights

34:14.389 --> 34:17.219
following their ships
underwater.

34:17.350 --> 34:19.310
They're not submarines,

34:19.429 --> 34:21.139
they're something else,
something's going on.

34:23.150 --> 34:26.940
COLLINS: Absolutely anything
could be hiding down there.

34:27.070 --> 34:30.280
If aliens were trying to direct

34:30.400 --> 34:31.989
seeds of life,

34:32.110 --> 34:35.120
the most obvious place
that they would hide them

34:35.239 --> 34:38.199
is within the oceans themself.

34:38.330 --> 34:41.920
And the depths of them
could hide vehicles,

34:42.040 --> 34:44.460
could even hide bases.

34:44.590 --> 34:46.300
Uh, for hundreds,
if not thousands of years,

34:46.420 --> 34:48.800
we would not be aware
of their presence.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.510
NARRATOR:
Alien craft,

34:52.630 --> 34:55.510
hidden in our oceans
for thousands of years?

34:55.639 --> 34:57.810
While many dismiss the idea

34:57.930 --> 35:00.350
as little more
than science fiction,

35:00.480 --> 35:03.190
ancient astronaut theorists
point to a recent innovation

35:03.310 --> 35:05.520
in marine warfare.

35:05.650 --> 35:09.690
In May 2017,
the United Kingdom announced

35:09.820 --> 35:13.860
its newest submarine program,
the Astute class.

35:13.990 --> 35:16.830
These nuclear attack subs
can carry a crew

35:16.950 --> 35:21.620
of almost 100 sailors,
descend more than 1,000 feet,

35:21.750 --> 35:26.170
and remain submerged
for up to 25 years.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.130
The only reason
they need to surface

35:28.250 --> 35:30.630
is to take on food and supplies.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.470
But experts contend
that the ocean

35:33.590 --> 35:35.720
is so rich in resources

35:35.840 --> 35:39.390
that advances in technology
may soon enable submarines

35:39.510 --> 35:43.190
to harvest all of the materials
they need underwater.

35:43.310 --> 35:46.810
The oceans have everything
that the crew of a ship

35:46.940 --> 35:48.730
would need to survive.

35:48.860 --> 35:52.030
It's got plants and animals

35:52.150 --> 35:54.660
that can be harvested for food.

35:54.780 --> 35:58.200
There's minerals and salt that
can be taken from the water.

35:58.330 --> 36:01.500
You can actually
desalinate the water

36:01.620 --> 36:04.330
to make clean drinking water.

36:04.460 --> 36:08.590
You can even separate
the hydrogen

36:08.710 --> 36:11.130
from the oxygen in the water

36:11.250 --> 36:12.840
to create fuel

36:12.960 --> 36:15.340
and-and air to breathe.

36:15.470 --> 36:18.640
Everything that is necessary
for life

36:18.760 --> 36:21.430
can be found in the oceans,

36:21.560 --> 36:23.930
and it may be
that if extraterrestrials

36:24.060 --> 36:27.020
are in our oceans,
they're not just hiding there,

36:27.150 --> 36:29.650
this may be
their preferred environment.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.570
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that extraterrestrials

36:32.690 --> 36:34.990
are not just hiding
beneath the sea,

36:35.110 --> 36:38.700
but view our oceans
as their preferred territory?

36:38.820 --> 36:41.870
Some scientists suggest

36:41.990 --> 36:45.290
that aquatic creatures
are better-suited than humans

36:45.410 --> 36:47.290
for space travel.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.460
DENNIN:
Because of the fact

36:50.590 --> 36:52.960
that we're terrestrial
and we walk on the ground,

36:53.090 --> 36:56.130
as humans, we're very tied
to our 2-D motions...

36:56.260 --> 36:59.140
That is moving only left,
right and forward and back.

37:00.350 --> 37:01.760
Creatures that grow up

37:01.890 --> 37:04.390
in a fundamentally
aquatic environment

37:04.520 --> 37:07.770
are much more used to all
of the 3-D motion that comes

37:07.890 --> 37:09.770
with being able
to move up and down,

37:09.900 --> 37:13.020
as well as forward and backward
and left and right in the ocean.

37:13.150 --> 37:16.400
Our musculoskeletal system needs
the impact of gravity, um,

37:16.530 --> 37:19.200
to remain healthy,
and so, I think,

37:19.320 --> 37:21.580
just the weightlessness
is one of the biggest challenges

37:21.700 --> 37:24.240
to humans living
in space conditions.

37:24.370 --> 37:26.410
So you can imagine
that something adapted

37:26.540 --> 37:29.000
to an aqueous environment could

37:29.120 --> 37:31.170
potentially do better
in a low-gravity environment.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.050
NARRATOR:
Considering the advantages

37:35.170 --> 37:39.260
that aquatic life-forms have
over terrestrial life-forms,

37:39.380 --> 37:41.090
and the fact that more than 90%

37:41.220 --> 37:44.640
of Earth's oceans
remain unexamined...

37:44.770 --> 37:47.230
is it possible
that there are creatures

37:47.350 --> 37:48.690
lurking beneath the water

37:48.810 --> 37:52.400
that are more sophisticated
than humans?

37:52.520 --> 37:55.070
If so, could they have been
sent here on meteors

37:55.190 --> 37:56.490
from distant planets?

37:58.610 --> 38:01.070
And does our inability
to explore the extreme depths

38:01.200 --> 38:04.330
of their world mean that
it is only a matter of time

38:04.450 --> 38:07.000
before they emerge from the sea

38:07.120 --> 38:09.710
to take over ours?

38:15.090 --> 38:16.920
NARRATOR:
St. Paul, Minnesota.

38:17.050 --> 38:20.050
2008.

38:20.180 --> 38:23.930
Arnold Landé, a retired
heart and lung surgeon,

38:24.050 --> 38:27.470
announces he has patented a
revolutionary type of scuba suit

38:27.600 --> 38:31.440
that will allow humans
to breathe liquid air.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.190
Key to his invention
is a special solution

38:34.310 --> 38:36.780
of highly oxygenated
perfluorocarbons,

38:36.900 --> 38:38.530
a type of liquid

38:38.650 --> 38:41.860
that can dissolve
enormous quantities of gas.

38:41.990 --> 38:45.780
And while the technology
is still in development,

38:45.910 --> 38:49.370
if Landé succeeds,
humans will be able to dive

38:49.500 --> 38:52.420
to more extreme depths
than ever before.

38:52.540 --> 38:56.250
In these dark recesses
of Earth's oceans,

38:56.380 --> 38:58.960
could we discover that humans
share the Earth

38:59.090 --> 39:02.510
with much more intelligent
and sophisticated life-forms

39:02.630 --> 39:05.260
than anything found on land?

39:05.390 --> 39:09.520
Frankly, we have no idea
what might be down there.

39:09.640 --> 39:12.140
Exploration has been
very limited.

39:12.270 --> 39:14.690
There are vast parts
of the ocean

39:14.810 --> 39:18.020
about which we know
absolutely nothing.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.940
As humans, we tend to believe
that we have dominion

39:21.070 --> 39:25.120
over the Earth, but in the vast
oceans beneath us,

39:25.240 --> 39:28.740
there could be all kinds
of advanced civilizations.

39:28.870 --> 39:32.040
Even ones that have been here
for much longer

39:32.160 --> 39:34.120
than we've been on this planet.

39:34.250 --> 39:37.340
And they've come here
from other solar systems

39:37.460 --> 39:39.710
and then came to our planet

39:39.840 --> 39:42.880
where they're now
living underwater.

39:43.010 --> 39:44.970
And it seems incredible to us,

39:45.090 --> 39:47.640
but we may be seeing
their ships,

39:47.760 --> 39:50.770
these USOs coming
out of the water,

39:50.890 --> 39:54.850
and there may be some
highly advanced civilization

39:54.980 --> 39:59.070
that's in these vast oceans
that we have yet to explore.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.110
Anything could be down there.

40:01.230 --> 40:04.450
TSOUKALOS:
Some people have proposed

40:04.570 --> 40:09.200
that the Earth served
as some gigantic Petri dish.

40:09.330 --> 40:12.750
And so you have to wonder
what else can emerge on Earth

40:12.870 --> 40:14.500
that we don't even know about?

40:16.460 --> 40:18.210
HENRY: Could there be more
sophisticated life-forms

40:18.340 --> 40:20.380
than us,
not just on distant planets,

40:20.500 --> 40:23.050
but right here
in our own oceans?

40:23.170 --> 40:26.180
Not aliens, but earthlings?

40:26.300 --> 40:29.430
NARRATOR: If extraterrestrials
seeded the Earth

40:29.550 --> 40:31.850
and continue to use it
as a genetic laboratory,

40:31.970 --> 40:34.390
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest,

40:34.520 --> 40:36.980
could further
deep-sea exploration

40:37.100 --> 40:40.690
discover a species
more advanced than humans?

40:40.820 --> 40:43.990
Perhaps creatures resembling
the amphibious gods

40:44.110 --> 40:46.740
depicted by our ancestors?

40:46.860 --> 40:49.660
And will we only have true
dominion over the Earth

40:49.780 --> 40:52.330
once we are able
to fully explore

40:52.450 --> 40:55.710
and inhabit
these depths as well?

40:55.830 --> 40:58.210
Some ancient astronaut
theorists believe

40:58.330 --> 41:02.590
the creatures of the deep may
already have plans for humanity.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.010
Are there extraterrestrials
in fact in our oceans

41:05.130 --> 41:08.890
that are experimenting
with different types of beings?

41:09.010 --> 41:12.180
And are they looking ultimately
to upgrade humanity

41:12.310 --> 41:14.180
with some of these discoveries?

41:14.310 --> 41:16.180
Is that what's in our future,

41:16.310 --> 41:18.480
that there could be
extraterrestrial beings

41:18.600 --> 41:20.360
that will come out
of Earth's ocean

41:20.480 --> 41:22.900
that will deliver some kind
of revelation that says,

41:23.020 --> 41:25.400
"Hey guys,
this isn't all there is.

41:25.530 --> 41:29.950
You can, in fact, transform
yourself into this,"

41:30.070 --> 41:32.620
and that will be the future
evolution of humanity.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.500
NARRATOR: Instead of looking
for alien civilizations

41:35.620 --> 41:37.790
beyond our solar system,

41:37.910 --> 41:41.710
might we find them in the
darkest depths of our oceans?

41:44.050 --> 41:46.010
Is it possible
that there is already a species

41:46.130 --> 41:48.050
more advanced than humans

41:48.170 --> 41:51.340
hiding out in places
we can't reach

41:51.470 --> 41:55.810
that have been there
for thousands of years?

41:55.930 --> 41:58.730
Perhaps we will make
alien contact

41:58.850 --> 42:01.690
not when they come down
from the sky

42:01.810 --> 42:04.520
but when they reemerge
from the sea.
