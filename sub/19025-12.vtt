00:03.080 --> 00:05.674
<i>Eve</i> ry <i>one here</i>
<i>thinks they know me inside and out.</i>

00:05.760 --> 00:07.910
- You look like you could use help.
- Nope.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.194
<i>Even random people.</i>

00:09.280 --> 00:12.113
- You need help?
- No, thanks, Dr whatever your name is.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.633
<i>They won't leave me alone.</i>

00:13.720 --> 00:15.597
- Free help here.
- Piss off.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.069
<i>You'd think</i>
<i>they'd know where I'm gonna end up.</i>

00:18.160 --> 00:20.037
Dr Cox, I could use a little help.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.111
BeyoncÃ©, you could use a lot of help,

00:22.200 --> 00:25.033
but we all have to play
the hand the big guy dealt us.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.352
Unless you're lucky enough to have those
<i>Queer Eye</i> guys show up at your door.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.433
But I doubt even they have the brass
ones necessary to fix whatever this is.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.796
If you wanna use the appearance angle
to knock my self-esteem,

00:36.880 --> 00:40.998
do it when my hair doesn't look awesome.
I know. It's new wax.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.196
- What is?
- It's OK to want a piece.

00:44.160 --> 00:49.393
Check out Mrs Barlow's chart. I doubt
myself with interstitial lung diseases.

00:49.480 --> 00:54.349
Handle this yourself, Britney.
I'm going with female pop stars today.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.070
Back when I was a resident
I had trouble with metabolic diseases.

00:59.160 --> 01:04.075
So I grabbed every case I could get
my hands on until I had it down pat.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.754
Got it.
You had trouble with metabolic diseases?

01:06.840 --> 01:09.559
No, I'm a good doctor.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.511
There you go.

01:13.280 --> 01:18.673
Hello, Mr Gallbladder. Don't you get
too comfy next to Mr Liver

01:18.760 --> 01:21.832
because here comes
Dr Turk's robot laser.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.351
Christopher, I could do without
the colour commentary.

01:27.440 --> 01:31.718
Why a colour commentary?
Cos I'm doing it? Just kidding.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.073
That was a near perfect
laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.310
Have you been working on your dexterity?

01:37.400 --> 01:40.870
I've been playing a little
John Madden football on my Xbox.

01:40.960 --> 01:44.748
I'd like to play
John Madden football on her Xbox.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.116
On who, Todd?
There are no women here.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.156
Well, it's still funny.

01:50.240 --> 01:55.951
The Todd used to be our number one
lab-coli guy. The torch has been passed.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.430
Thank you, sir.
Dude. Wait till you hear this.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.069
Dr Wen just said
I'm the number one lab-coli guy.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.957
Disappointed?

02:05.040 --> 02:10.114
I shoulda waited till there was a chick
around for the Xbox joke. You know?

02:12.080 --> 02:13.991
He knows.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.758
<i>I was excited for Turk and</i>
<i>he was excited about my big hair news.</i>

02:19.840 --> 02:22.513
- New wax did that?
- I couldn't believe it either.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.433
- New wax did that?
- I couldn't believe it either.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.238
Sorry about the girl talk.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.754
- We were talking man's...
- Big trucks.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.751
Have you seen these lately?

02:31.840 --> 02:36.516
- Your hair smells like Elliot's.
- Your breath smells like chimichangas.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.194
- Is that racist?
- That depends.

02:39.280 --> 02:42.317
- Did you have them for breakfast?
- Maybe.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.951
<i>What Carla really smelled</i>
<i>was all the excitement in the air.</i>

02:46.040 --> 02:49.476
<i>There's a visiting professor coming</i>
<i>who's a medical attending</i>

02:49.560 --> 02:54.031
<i>and a surgeon. Two specialties</i>
<i>and to us, that kinda makes him...</i>

02:55.840 --> 02:57.796
<i>... Super-Doc.</i>

03:03.080 --> 03:04.593
<i>Super-Doc.</i>

03:04.680 --> 03:05.669
Dammit.

03:08.280 --> 03:11.955
<i>Fine, a super doc</i>
<i>with obsessive-compulsive disorder.</i>

03:12.040 --> 03:14.395
How hard is it
to step in here left foot first

03:14.480 --> 03:17.711
and simultaneously exhale
as my right foot plants? How hard?

03:17.800 --> 03:22.316
- Not that hard?
- Exactly, shaved-head guy.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.029
- Whose hair smells like lilacs?
- Hers and his.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.072
Well, that's very pre <i>tty</i>.
And deeply disturbing.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.709
- The jar said unisex.
- I know.

03:35.800 --> 03:36.949
Dammit.

Dr Kevin Casey.
Dr Kevin Casey.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.716
At my hospital they don't make you
sign forms to cut open people,

03:58.800 --> 04:01.314
you just have to
bring your own knifey thingy.

04:01.400 --> 04:04.233
- Scalpel.
- That's the word. Dr Kevin Casey.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.871
- Why do you keep saying your name?
- It just keeps me from losing my...

04:08.960 --> 04:11.554
jinkies later,
thinking I forgot something.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.597
It's OK. You can say it.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.514
It's just that you're a doctor
with pre <i>tty</i> severe OCD.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.512
- It's not a secret.
- I know. I always talk like this.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.114
Be hard keeping that up
for the month I'm here.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.873
- I can do it.
- I believe in you.

04:37.960 --> 04:42.238
Kevin Casey? Holy Cow!
Get outta Dodge.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.869
Tell me this,
are you shaking hands nowadays?

04:45.960 --> 04:49.589
Well, a lifetime of therapy,
and a whole lot of Zoloft

04:49.680 --> 04:52.513
just so I can
appropriately greet you, big guy.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.831
- Attaboy.
- I do have a three-second limit.

04:55.920 --> 04:58.036
Boy, who doesn't?

04:58.120 --> 05:01.908
You realise I haven't laid eyes on you
since we were residents together?

05:02.000 --> 05:07.074
And, I'll tell you this, big Kevo,
I always knew I'd see you again.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.196
I never thought I'd see that guy again.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.953
I mean, he had to drop out
of our residency class

05:12.040 --> 05:14.873
because of the God-awful severity
of his condition.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.315
I can't imagine you as a resident.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.756
- Hey, Coxy?
- Shut up, jackass. I rock.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.832
Was the hair and earring cos you were
in a band or cos you loved pirates?

05:27.920 --> 05:30.388
<i>Loved pirates. Just like me.</i>

05:30.480 --> 05:34.871
- I don't want a piece.
- Well, you're the only one. OK?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.315
Dr Cox, I'm gonna
take you out for a beer.

05:37.400 --> 05:41.439
I wanna hear all the stories about
what my mentor was like as a newbie.

05:41.520 --> 05:45.752
Pink, for the billionth time, no,
I will not go out for a beer with you.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.353
Repeat after me:

05:47.440 --> 05:52.833
Dr Cox, you are not now,
nor will you ever be, my mentor.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.993
Dr Cox, you are not now,
nor will you ever be, my mentor.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.149
Yes.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.279
That oughta keep those damn crows
from crapping on my car all the time.

06:09.360 --> 06:14.070
I doubt they'll be back, sir. Unless
someone who comes up here every day,

06:14.160 --> 06:16.355
trying to find the courage to jump,

06:16.440 --> 06:19.796
passes the time by throwing birdseed
on your car's hood.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.713
Stop babbling, Ted.
No one's ever listening.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.712
The Italian gentlemen
that haul our medical waste away

06:25.800 --> 06:28.678
said if we don't stop
putting our regular trash

06:28.760 --> 06:31.832
in with the medical loads
they're gonna charge us double.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.514
Randall and I
can get rid of that garbage for you.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.511
What the hell are you two doing here?

06:36.600 --> 06:39.239
- We come up here to wrestle.
- And drink beer.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.550
Only the winner drinks beer.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.918
How much to make the garbage go away?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.070
Say, twenty bucks a month?

06:47.160 --> 06:49.879
- Twenty-three bucks a month.
- Deal.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.760
Sir, those darn birds are back.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.278
Dr Kevin Casey.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.272
<i>I have to say, it was amazing</i>
<i>watching Dr Casey work.</i>

07:03.360 --> 07:06.352
Carol, let's just put it out there.
You've got lupus.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.876
Instead of dwelling on the negative,
let's look at the positive.

07:09.960 --> 07:13.236
Your pericarditis is resolving.
Your renal function is good.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.553
Suicidal scavenger birds,
an excellent sign. Right?

07:19.640 --> 07:23.599
- That's a great sign.
- Okey-dokey, artichokey.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.996
- You are unflappable.
- It's true. I can't be flapped.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.072
- I'm more skittish.
- Yeah, you're like a big squirrel.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.835
I wish I was a swashbuckling doctor.
You know, like a pirate.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.480
<i>Enough about pirates</i>
<i>till you know him better.</i>

07:37.560 --> 07:39.516
Ahoy, there.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.672
You going to the... Oh-Arr?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.557
<i>I said enough.</i>

07:44.640 --> 07:48.713
You know, I couldn't have survived
in medicine if I didn't embrace my OCD.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.271
And, since I was compulsive,
I read the same textbooks over and over.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.318
I went through the procedures
over and over.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.790
I imagined every worst-case scenario
over and over and over...

07:59.880 --> 08:03.475
- Dr Casey? Dr Casey?
- Dr Kevin Casey.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.951
Even though I did those things, it's
the best advice I could give any doctor.

08:08.040 --> 08:11.157
Expect the unexpected
and you will never be surprised.

08:11.240 --> 08:16.109
<i>After one day it felt like he was</i>
<i>the mentor I wished Dr Cox would be.</i>

08:16.200 --> 08:19.670
<i>Still, I've got to stay cool.</i>
<i>I know I'm prone to hero worship.</i>

08:19.760 --> 08:23.469
Man, the surgeon in me is antsy.
I need to cut somebody up.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.311
Thanks for volunteering.
I'm not that strong on the brain.

08:28.400 --> 08:32.154
- I think this is the language centre.
- Really? Cos I don't feel a...

08:33.960 --> 08:37.873
- How cool is that?
- This is the foreign language centre.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.875
The cow says...

08:43.960 --> 08:45.837
The sheep says...

08:46.640 --> 08:48.995
Ladies and gentlemen, Macaulay Culkin.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.469
The French would help with the ladies.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.355
Dr Wen? Can I ask you a question?

08:59.440 --> 09:02.591
Was my time on the lap-coli
even faster than yours?

09:02.680 --> 09:03.874
Yes, it was.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.713
Some of the guys were saying
I kicked your ass,

09:06.800 --> 09:09.439
and I wanted them to shut up
if it wasn't true.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.239
But since it is, I'll just let it go.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.109
What?

09:16.200 --> 09:20.113
One thing I've learned is that
you never antagonise your boss,

09:20.200 --> 09:24.637
or the people that make the food,
cos either way you end up eating poo.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.952
Elliot, I can do whatever I want,
because these are magic.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.715
These are gonna take me
wherever I wanna go in life.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.598
Thanks to these,
I'm king of the world, baby.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.671
Can you feel it? Give me your pudding.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.995
- Pay up.
- Already?

09:44.080 --> 09:48.517
Look around. You won't find any garbage.
Let's see them twenty-three squids.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.156
It's all here.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.674
Come on.
What'd you do with all the garbage?

09:58.720 --> 10:00.597
That's not part of the deal.

10:00.680 --> 10:05.310
Randall, you, me, on the roof,
winner takes all.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.551
- You never learn, do you?
- Jammo.

10:10.720 --> 10:15.236
You know, Carla, your make-up today
does not in any way make you look like

10:15.320 --> 10:17.436
a desperate bowling alley prostitute.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.513
- What's with the sweet talk?
- Maybe Kevin is making me regress.

10:21.600 --> 10:25.195
You realise that back when
I was a resident, I was a kind lad.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.315
You get out.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.914
But I established myself
as the best damn doctor

10:29.000 --> 10:32.276
that ever roamed these filthy halls,
which is a curse actually

10:32.360 --> 10:36.273
because now I'm expected to make eye
contact with every insult to medicine

10:36.360 --> 10:38.078
that comes into this dump.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.755
- Here's that CT scan you ordered.
- Thank you.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.636
<i>Eye contact. He respects me.</i>

10:44.720 --> 10:48.679
He's anaemic, and he has bone fractures,
yet there's no sign of leukaemia.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.354
Don't tell me the great one is stumped.

10:51.440 --> 10:56.594
This is not the kind of thing that you
stick your head in on and figure out.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.354
- He's got Gaucher's disease.
- I beg your pardon?

11:00.440 --> 11:04.399
I tested his blood for deficiency
of beta-glycosidase activity.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.756
- I just sent out for one of those.
- No, you didn't.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.196
I wouldn't have figured it out
if you hadn't done the grunt work.

11:11.280 --> 11:15.159
It's like a jar of pickles, you
loosened the lid and pop! I took it off.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.151
Dr Kevin Casey.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.799
See you.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.272
<i>Kevin was getting the chance</i>
<i>to meet eve</i> ry <i>one around here.</i>

11:38.360 --> 11:40.510
See, the reason
the Xbox joke should work

11:40.600 --> 11:45.594
is that "Xbox" is like the perfect
word for a girl's party zone.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.796
- The Todd, is it?
- Oh, yeah.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.110
Can you make a phone call for me?

11:54.200 --> 11:56.350
- To who?
- To anyone.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.279
Making a phone call.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.558
Dr Casey, do you mind if I scrub in
on the lap-coli you're doing later?

12:04.640 --> 12:06.596
OK, I'll see you at four.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.756
- Cool trick.
- You should try it.

12:09.840 --> 12:13.992
It's good for dexterity and convincing
single women you're a power dork.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.435
You know, I'm really looking forward
to seeing you in action, sir.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.956
Takes a lot to make
the big dog sit up and take notice.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.278
I believe the word you're looking for
is "holy crap".

12:30.920 --> 12:32.797
Holy crap.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.796
I'm sorry, JD,
I just don't think pirates are cool.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.919
- Well, then you're not cool, Doug.
- JD, want to get a beer tonight?

12:41.000 --> 12:44.515
- Do chickens wish they could fly?
- I have no idea.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.956
- I like to think they do.
- So do I.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.271
OK, class, we have a guest
with us at rounds today.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.237
He's an old friend of yours truly,

12:53.320 --> 12:56.995
so let's all go out of our way to
treat him with the respect he deserves.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.675
- Hey, gang, my name is...
- I thought we'd change things up today.

13:02.760 --> 13:07.356
Instead of me questioning you, I'd like
to see you all go get your textbooks.

13:07.440 --> 13:11.353
And when you get back
you actually get to quiz us.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.513
A little harmless competition,
if my colleague here will consent to it.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.715
Sorry, are you done
with the speechifying?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.678
I'm kidding, you frightening bastard.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.479
OK, buddy, buddy.
Fuddy-buddy, fuddy-buddy.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.471
Go get your books!

13:31.160 --> 13:33.549
- Try not to touch me as much.
- Fair enough.

13:36.080 --> 13:41.393
Your van hasn't left the premises,
so where is all the trash is going?

13:41.840 --> 13:43.592
Away.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.116
I'll say the same thing I told the
grocer when I bought the spread

13:47.200 --> 13:50.272
to Hank Weinberg's poker night:
"This better be kosher."

13:50.360 --> 13:53.352
Otherwise it's not just Ted
who's gonna pay for it.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.830
If people keep pushing me for no reason,

13:58.920 --> 14:03.675
I swear I will hurl myself
off this building.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.877
- I'm not cleaning you up.
- Arm.

14:09.400 --> 14:14.076
Mark my words. If one more person
is mean to me for no reason, I'll do it.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.071
Shut up, bozo.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.913
One more person.
She didn't know the rules.

14:20.440 --> 14:24.911
One of you minions spit out another
question, will you? Nervous Guy!

14:25.000 --> 14:29.630
I don't care how many times your
pre-pubescent voice cracks. Hit me.

14:29.720 --> 14:35.431
OK. What is the demyelinating CNS
disorder associated with the JC virus?

14:36.720 --> 14:40.315
Progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.597
Snore.
Back to you there, half-pint.

14:44.360 --> 14:48.273
- Short jokes are a sign of desperation.
- Amen, brother.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.350
Yes, blonde girl.
You have yet another question?

14:57.000 --> 15:00.754
What is the pathologic abnormality
causing Bernard-Soulier disease?

15:00.840 --> 15:02.876
Absence of von Willebrand receptors.

15:02.960 --> 15:06.350
I hate to be childish about this,
but I have to "make".

15:06.440 --> 15:09.352
That means driving home
and scrubbing the toilet seat

15:09.440 --> 15:12.512
with industrial strength cleanser,
so can we call it a tie?

15:12.600 --> 15:15.239
No, ties are for sissies.

15:15.320 --> 15:19.074
Speaking of which, Newbie,
you've been uncharacteristically quiet.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.594
<i>I don't know why it popped into my head.</i>

15:21.680 --> 15:23.875
You had trouble with metabolic diseases?

15:23.960 --> 15:26.599
No. I'm a good doctor.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.714
<i>But I knew I had him.</i>

15:29.800 --> 15:33.395
My question
is concerning metabolic diseases.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.636
Oh, yes.

15:37.720 --> 15:43.238
What is the inborn error of metabolism
characterised by angiokeratomas?

15:43.320 --> 15:44.639
Please.

15:45.760 --> 15:50.038
OK, first I think
that we should go over the rules.

15:50.120 --> 15:54.352
Because if by some freak of nature
I'm not able to answer a question,

15:54.440 --> 15:57.034
then old Kev-Kev
cannot be declared the winner

15:57.120 --> 16:00.908
unless he can provide the answer.
Otherwise, we'll be going back and...

16:01.000 --> 16:04.788
Fabry's disease. Page 2,098 of
Harrison's Guide to Internal Medicine.

16:04.880 --> 16:08.395
Fun game,
but I'll be back in 48 minutes.

16:09.960 --> 16:13.669
<i>It's funny how one person can shake</i>
<i>another's foundation to the core.</i>

16:14.360 --> 16:16.635
<i>Half the time</i>
<i>the guy doesn't know he did it.</i>

16:16.720 --> 16:19.314
Watching Dr Casey's procedure again?

16:19.400 --> 16:23.154
- He's so fast.
- Yep, he's out of our league.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.914
<i>Funnier still how the same guy could be</i>
<i>the mentor I've always been looking for.</i>

16:33.000 --> 16:38.074
Nice place. It's got that
great vomit and peanuts smell.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.631
Yeah. Reminds me of my first girlfriend.
She was a carny.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.716
I'm always trying to get Cox
to get a beer with me. He never does.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.509
You don't carry around pictures of him
and his attending, do you?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.711
Perfect.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.876
Well, I don't carry anything around.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.475
Cos those losers who've been
practicing medicine for three years,

17:01.560 --> 17:04.154
but still look for a mentor
to pat them on the back,

17:04.240 --> 17:06.356
they're pathetic.
You know what I mean?

17:07.520 --> 17:08.509
Totally.

17:08.599 --> 17:11.512
<i>Yep. It's funny what one person can do.</i>

17:13.440 --> 17:15.907
OK, I'm gonna need another beer.

17:18.280 --> 17:21.396
<i>None of us slept last night.</i>
<i>How I know that is irrelevant.</i>

17:21.480 --> 17:25.358
<i>What does matter is I think we formed</i>
<i>a special bond because of it.</i>

17:25.440 --> 17:27.317
Stop looking at me, or die.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.472
<i>And the guy who caused it</i>
<i>thinks we're his best friends.</i>

17:30.560 --> 17:34.075
- Morning, fellows.
- What do you say there, Kevin?

17:34.160 --> 17:37.914
All right, all six of your
butt cheeks just tightened up.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.152
Someone here pissing you guys off?
Cos I will give 'em some attitude.

17:42.240 --> 17:45.676
- That guy.
- Hey, Hair Club.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.228
That suit,
did that come with the flop-sweat?

17:53.760 --> 17:57.719
You can do this, Theodore.
Take as much time as you need.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.318
OK.
Here we go, baby.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.718
I don't understand
why this guy bothers him so much.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.713
Perry is a dysfunctional, unsuccessful,
emotionally damaged old man.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.358
- No offence.
- None taken.

18:15.480 --> 18:18.199
Being the best doctor here
is the only thing he had.

18:18.280 --> 18:21.795
Just because we have a child together
doesn't mean you know me.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.996
Mmm-kay, princess? Watch and learn.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.117
Say, Kev-Kev?
Would you love to come and join us?

18:27.200 --> 18:29.111
Oh, thanks.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.080
What's up with the oatmeal today?

18:32.160 --> 18:34.071
- Too much milk.
- No.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.316
Not enough butter.

18:37.400 --> 18:40.756
- That's it.
- Did you just diagnose the oatmeal?

18:40.840 --> 18:44.355
You can't just go...
and diagnose the oatmeal.

18:44.440 --> 18:47.716
He just did.
Kevin, are you single?

18:47.800 --> 18:50.189
- Yeah. Why, are you?
- I'm thinking about it.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.633
Yeah, me too.

18:51.720 --> 18:57.078
What in the hell just happened?
What just happened?

18:59.160 --> 19:03.312
OK, I've removed the gallbladder,
sealed the vessels, and time.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.109
Oh, my God! You can't even beat
Dr Kevin Casey's lap-coli time

19:07.200 --> 19:09.270
when you're imagining it.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.399
I could be just as fast if I was
like him and practised over and over.

19:13.480 --> 19:14.959
Yeah, but you don't.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.396
I could spend my spare time
doing stupid hand exercises.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.708
I know, but you don't.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.358
- Well, I could.
- You don't.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.396
- But...
- Don't.

19:23.480 --> 19:25.436
Could you enjoy this any less?

19:25.520 --> 19:29.877
Because of these.
I don't think I can.

19:32.400 --> 19:36.951
In, gallbladder, out, done. Four
seconds. A new record. World record!

19:39.640 --> 19:42.279
Look, I did my psych rotation. OK?

19:42.360 --> 19:45.830
I know my father abandoning us
and only showing up in my life

19:45.920 --> 19:48.718
when he needs a place to sleep
or a free prostate exam

19:48.800 --> 19:50.950
is probably gonna be an issue. I get it.

19:51.040 --> 19:56.398
But it's not like I'm looking for a
mentor. I just want a little validation.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.916
It's like when Kelso gave you a cupcake
cos you went four days

20:00.000 --> 20:03.117
- without killing a patient.
- That was awesome.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.238
<i>I've always felt Doug understood me.</i>
<i>After knowing him for three years,</i>

20:08.320 --> 20:13.075
<i>I suddenly realised he was the type of</i>
<i>mentor I always wished Dr Cox would be.</i>

20:13.160 --> 20:14.593
<i>Wait!</i>

20:14.680 --> 20:17.194
- Doug, get the hell out of here.
- OK.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.432
<i>When rational men</i>
<i>are forced to face their shortcomings,</i>

20:22.520 --> 20:24.715
<i>they all do the same thing.</i>

20:24.800 --> 20:26.995
<i>Blame Kevin Casey.</i>

20:27.080 --> 20:29.640
<i>Who gave him the right to judge me?</i>
<i>I sure didn't.</i>

20:29.720 --> 20:32.473
<i>I'll give him a piece of my mind,</i>
<i>see how he likes it.</i>

20:32.560 --> 20:35.472
<i>Unfortunately, no one knew</i>
<i>where the son of a bitch was.</i>

20:38.240 --> 20:43.314
I'm far too irritable to pretend I don't
hate you so let's cut to the chase.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.676
If you know where all the garbage
in this hospital is going,

20:46.760 --> 20:49.479
I'll give you eight dollars.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.510
- Sorry, sir.
- Thanks.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.275
Dr Kelso? The crows are making
your pimp mobile look like Spin Art.

20:58.360 --> 20:59.873
Dammit!

20:59.960 --> 21:01.837
It's just one step.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.031
Come on, already.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.436
Who am I kidding?

21:16.120 --> 21:19.078
You did it, Teddy.
It's over.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.355
Here comes sweet relief.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.918
- Is this heaven?
- It's garbage.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.150
Way to cost us a cherry gig, bra.

21:33.240 --> 21:34.719
What?

21:35.440 --> 21:41.151
I want my money back.
And, Ted, shower and get back to work.

21:42.880 --> 21:46.793
If you try that around the corner,
you can land right in the street.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.670
<i>Found him.</i>
<i>Brace yourself, mister.</i>

21:51.760 --> 21:54.957
<i>You're about to get an earful, JD style.</i>

21:57.680 --> 21:58.669
Hey, buddy.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.474
Hey.
Give me a minute, will you?

22:04.560 --> 22:07.358
No, Kevin,
I have to talk to you right now.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.599
Dammit!

22:10.680 --> 22:12.591
Later's cool, too.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.958
I'm sorry, I just spent
the last few days meeting new people,

22:17.040 --> 22:21.192
trying to get used to this place,
and I'm stressed and I'm fried...

22:22.080 --> 22:24.469
...and I just wanna go home.

22:24.560 --> 22:30.271
But even though my last surgery was two
hours ago I can't stop washing my hands.

22:38.040 --> 22:41.191
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look...

22:42.760 --> 22:47.959
This is a weak moment.
Nobody's supposed to see this.

22:50.800 --> 22:55.715
And, mark my words, I'll clean up the
soap probably several thousand times.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.518
Everyone's got their own burdens, JD,

23:03.320 --> 23:07.632
And I'm not gonna be one of those people
that dumps mine on somebody else.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.276
Now, what do you need?

23:13.920 --> 23:15.831
Nothing.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.195
<i>None of us needed anything.</i>

23:36.600 --> 23:39.558
<i>I think owning your burdens</i>
<i>is half the battle.</i>

23:42.760 --> 23:47.072
<i>Turk knows that he'll eventually have to</i>
<i>decide what his priorities really are.</i>

23:47.160 --> 23:49.071
Baby, come to bed.

23:59.360 --> 24:03.069
<i>And Dr Cox knows he has to find</i>
<i>something else to hang his hat on.</i>

24:03.160 --> 24:07.278
You, my friend, are going to be
the best baseball player in the world,

24:07.360 --> 24:11.717
which will make me the best baseball
player in the world's father.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.432
Can't you hear it, Jack?
Can't you hear it?

24:18.600 --> 24:20.591
<i>Still, it's not that daunting</i>

24:20.680 --> 24:23.911
<i>if you look around and</i>
<i>see what other people have to deal with.</i>

24:24.000 --> 24:27.072
- Good night, Dr Casey.
- Good night, JD.
