00:01.917 --> 00:03.557
Come on up here, pretty girl!

00:03.558 --> 00:05.311
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:05.631 --> 00:06.259
What's wrong?

00:06.260 --> 00:08.157
I respect any woman too much to do that

00:08.159 --> 00:10.170
outside the confines of marriage.

00:10.345 --> 00:11.660
Drop out the race, Teddy.

00:11.661 --> 00:12.909
There is no affair.

00:12.910 --> 00:14.440
You have till the weekend to decide.

00:14.441 --> 00:16.948
After that, these get leaked to the press.

00:17.066 --> 00:19.829
I'd like you to do a duet to
help bolster the reputation

00:19.830 --> 00:21.504
of a fellow Edgehill artist.

00:21.505 --> 00:22.428
Who?

00:23.345 --> 00:25.628
I cannot believe we have to do this.

00:25.778 --> 00:27.057
Well, let's just get it over with.

00:27.058 --> 00:28.427
We'll never have to do it again.

00:28.706 --> 00:30.475
This is gonna be huge.

00:38.020 --> 00:40.169
That was a lot more fun than
I thought it was gonna be.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.184
Oh, yeah.

00:41.185 --> 00:42.644
Wow. Unbelievable.

00:42.645 --> 00:44.863
You guys could not top that if you tried.

00:45.653 --> 00:47.391
Nah, it wasn't half bad.

00:47.638 --> 00:48.796
Apart from the company.

00:48.797 --> 00:51.776
We are gonna release that
song as a live single.

00:51.777 --> 00:52.735
Okay. Amazing.

00:52.853 --> 00:53.774
I don't know what to say.

00:53.775 --> 00:54.951
How about saying...

00:55.382 --> 00:58.141
"Rayna, I'm so excited to
release your new album"?

00:58.142 --> 00:59.088
All right, it's a deal.

00:59.089 --> 01:00.984
Whoo! Hey!

01:00.985 --> 01:02.328
Juliette and I performed together,

01:02.329 --> 01:04.382
and, you know, everybody survived.
You know? Yep.

01:04.384 --> 01:07.721
Hey, Liam. Welcome to Edgehill-Republic.

01:07.950 --> 01:09.658
Yep, to us. Thank you. Cheers.

01:09.659 --> 01:10.693
Cheers.

01:10.844 --> 01:12.540
Now don't let me stop the celebrating.

01:12.541 --> 01:13.503
That was fantastic.

01:13.504 --> 01:15.504
You were... you were
great out there tonight.

01:15.505 --> 01:16.369
Thanks, babe.

01:16.370 --> 01:18.154
Oh, well, we'll get out of you guys' hair.

01:18.155 --> 01:20.151
Rayna, again, fantastic.

01:20.609 --> 01:22.178
Call you tomorrow. Okay, thanks, buck.

01:22.179 --> 01:23.105
See you, buck.

01:23.106 --> 01:25.593
Rayna, makes sure this one
behaves himself, okay?

01:25.594 --> 01:28.677
Ha! You get no promises from me on that.

01:31.739 --> 01:32.773
Bye, love.

01:33.515 --> 01:34.274
Bye, babe. Take care.

01:34.275 --> 01:36.066
Thanks. See you later.
Thanks for everything, Liam.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.004
Hey.

01:37.458 --> 01:38.524
You good to go?

01:38.866 --> 01:41.176
Uh, you want have a glass
of champagne first?

01:41.177 --> 01:43.555
Let's, uh, let's have some at home.

01:43.642 --> 01:45.124
I'll go get the girls.

01:45.401 --> 01:46.420
Okay.

01:51.785 --> 01:53.139
What kind of pictures?

01:54.008 --> 01:55.651
Just shots of us talking.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.340
And... and there's one of
me giving Peggy a hug.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.696
I find it really hard
to believe that anybody,

02:00.697 --> 02:02.211
especially Coleman,

02:02.505 --> 02:05.140
would try to leak photos
of two people talking.

02:06.219 --> 02:08.979
I mean, look, the fact is, I'm winning,

02:09.657 --> 02:11.680
and Coleman thinks that a fabricated affair

02:11.681 --> 02:13.739
is enough to make me drop out.

02:14.146 --> 02:15.500
Is it fabricated?

02:15.665 --> 02:17.995
Rayna, I did not have an affair.

02:18.177 --> 02:19.987
Well, then what were you
doing in a public park

02:19.988 --> 02:21.250
with Peggy Kenter?

02:21.251 --> 02:23.949
Peggy shared something with
me in confidence, okay?

02:24.179 --> 02:27.245
Now the truth is, she and
Robert are having some trouble.

02:27.779 --> 02:28.716
She signed this prenup,

02:28.717 --> 02:31.078
and she's scared that he's gonna leave her.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.723
So she came to you for accounting advice?

02:33.724 --> 02:35.479
She just wanted to talk to someone

02:35.708 --> 02:37.436
without it being gossiped about later.

02:37.437 --> 02:39.008
That's not happening for any of us,

02:39.009 --> 02:40.464
especially our children.

02:40.465 --> 02:41.061
Yeah, I know,

02:41.062 --> 02:43.407
and that's the part that
pisses me off the most.

02:46.774 --> 02:48.444
I just don't understand why
Coleman would do this.

02:48.445 --> 02:49.401
I don't...

02:49.725 --> 02:52.279
I mean, is winning this
election so important?

02:53.246 --> 02:54.519
Apparently so.

03:00.109 --> 03:03.549
It says, "Juliette, here's to
the next 25 years on our label",

03:03.550 --> 03:05.176
"your family at Edgehill-Republic.

03:05.177 --> 03:07.032
Sincerely, Marshall Evans."

03:07.033 --> 03:09.489
It's very nice. I mean, I love flowers.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.541
But I don't want flowers. I
want my tour back on, Glenn.

03:12.833 --> 03:13.836
Hold on.

03:14.629 --> 03:15.605
Xx

03:16.763 --> 03:17.812
It's nobody.

03:18.268 --> 03:21.700
I get it. I get this is a
step in the right direction.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.688
Hold on.

03:23.861 --> 03:24.831
Hey, babe.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.512
Hey, let me call you back.

03:27.765 --> 03:29.684
Hey! What are you doing here?

03:29.685 --> 03:32.160
Running my best splits in, like, two weeks.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.348
You are good motivation.

03:35.503 --> 03:36.685
What, you ran here?

03:36.686 --> 03:38.585
Yeah. Why?

03:38.923 --> 03:42.166
Because I like you. So does Nashville.

03:42.167 --> 03:43.606
Xx

03:43.772 --> 03:47.497
yeah, Glenn said he's been getting
some calls from promoters. So...

03:48.095 --> 03:49.899
Uh, my dad's pacing me. Gotta go.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.367
Wait a second. He can wait for a minute.

03:57.484 --> 04:00.231
Uh, I really... gotta go.

04:00.476 --> 04:02.887
Oh, God. Are you serious?

04:03.097 --> 04:04.315
How long you gonna keep up

04:04.316 --> 04:07.142
this whole "no sex until marriage" thing?

04:07.422 --> 04:09.239
Till I'm...

04:09.886 --> 04:11.112
Married.

04:11.869 --> 04:14.439
Look, that's just how my
parents raised me. Okay?

04:15.006 --> 04:15.974
Well...

04:16.382 --> 04:19.555
I'm gonna have to give 'em a
piece of my mind about that.

04:19.557 --> 04:20.719
You could meet 'em.

04:21.766 --> 04:23.934
Uh, pace car's gettin' antsy.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.302
So will you... meet 'em?

04:26.870 --> 04:28.046
Yeah. When?

04:28.452 --> 04:30.548
Church. Tomorrow.

04:30.549 --> 04:32.202
Okay. Yeah.

04:32.203 --> 04:33.385
I'll see you tomorrow.

04:33.386 --> 04:34.372
Okay.

04:38.021 --> 04:38.773
Church?

04:43.558 --> 04:44.883
You a little stressed out, Cy?

04:44.884 --> 04:45.853
Deacon.

04:47.619 --> 04:49.001
Deacon, Kelly. Kelly, Deacon.

04:49.002 --> 04:49.601
Hey, Kelly.

04:49.602 --> 04:52.045
Thanks, babe. How you doing, man?

04:52.194 --> 04:54.027
Oh, yeah. I'm doing good.

04:54.497 --> 04:56.140
I mean, I'm not doing this good, but....

04:56.141 --> 04:58.477
You remember that dive hotel we
used to play at in Franklin?

04:58.478 --> 05:01.139
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, the Lomax inn.

05:02.198 --> 05:04.249
Long way from the Lomax
to the hall of fame.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.260
I must've got off the wrong bus somewhere.

05:07.505 --> 05:08.946
How long y'all in town for?

05:08.947 --> 05:10.256
Uh, we're here for a week.

05:10.257 --> 05:11.392
Do some overdubs,

05:11.393 --> 05:15.098
and then, uh, off to
Asia or Australia or...

05:15.099 --> 05:16.340
Oh, no.

05:17.082 --> 05:19.980
Ha ha ha! Freakin' Deacon!

05:19.981 --> 05:21.799
The man, the myth.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.671
Don't you call me a legend, Kent.
I'm not dead yet.

05:25.672 --> 05:27.747
Hey, brother, you and Rayna...

05:28.168 --> 05:29.558
You killed it the other night at the Ryman.

05:29.559 --> 05:32.421
I mean, we think you never sounded better.

05:32.716 --> 05:33.688
Thank you.

05:33.774 --> 05:34.951
Where is Dubbie?

05:35.581 --> 05:37.332
Well, Dubbie's hanging up his strat,

05:37.333 --> 05:38.495
which is why...

05:39.686 --> 05:42.304
We want you to hit the road
with us when we head back out.

05:42.998 --> 05:43.585
Seriously?

05:43.586 --> 05:44.454
2-year contract.

05:44.455 --> 05:46.609
And if everybody's still
diggin' it, then...

05:47.030 --> 05:47.793
Full member.

05:47.794 --> 05:50.278
You could have your choice of any
picker still livin'. Why me?

05:50.279 --> 05:52.575
We figure you'd be a good person

05:53.349 --> 05:54.896
to bring on tour with us.

05:57.945 --> 05:59.092
One year, huh?

05:59.193 --> 06:00.611
Six months for me.

06:01.146 --> 06:02.217
What, all of you?

06:02.218 --> 06:05.508
A sober band. Who woulda thunk it?

06:05.977 --> 06:07.055
Not me.

06:07.056 --> 06:08.971
That explains the soda pop, though, huh?

06:10.273 --> 06:12.731
Yeah, well, you know, everything
happens for a reason.

06:13.121 --> 06:16.267
Maybe you weren't supposed to
come out with us until now.

06:17.441 --> 06:18.293
Maybe.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.357
Would like a little time to think
about it, if that's all right.

06:20.358 --> 06:21.636
Well, sleep on it, man.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.260
I appreciate it.

06:25.137 --> 06:27.132
What's keeping you tied 
down here

06:27.233 --> 06:28.427
in Nashville?

06:35.145 --> 06:37.073
Scarlett "ring of fire" O'Connor.

06:37.074 --> 06:38.939
You are making fun of me.

06:39.128 --> 06:41.780
Oh, he's not. He's been
talkin' about it all day.

06:42.074 --> 06:44.452
Well, it was good, and it
was worth talking about.

06:44.746 --> 06:46.187
I'll see you upstairs. Okay.

06:49.281 --> 06:51.227
You really were good, you know.

06:51.569 --> 06:52.651
Thank you.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.672
I didn't know you had it in you.

06:54.673 --> 06:55.440
Neither did I.

06:55.441 --> 06:58.074
Two shots of Tequila...
apparently I'm transformed.

06:58.882 --> 07:02.048
Listen, I... I know this is
a little crazy, but, um,

07:02.049 --> 07:04.683
I know a band that's looking
for a female lead singer.

07:04.802 --> 07:06.363
I think you'd be perfect.

07:06.610 --> 07:09.793
Oh. Thank you. Um, but
I-I'm not a performer.

07:09.794 --> 07:11.713
Ooh, I disagree.

07:11.714 --> 07:13.937
Well, I only just started
getting used to songwriting.

07:13.938 --> 07:15.484
I have to talk to Gunnar about th...

07:15.485 --> 07:18.600
this is Scott... the lead
guitarist for the epic fails.

Word of the day... wow!

07:58.269 --> 07:59.237
Yeah.

07:59.238 --> 08:00.864
And how long y'all been together?

08:00.917 --> 08:02.260
Since junior high.

08:02.261 --> 08:04.671
J.T. and I started playing
together in Ohio.

08:04.710 --> 08:07.785
We rocked black sabbath at
a seventh grade assembly.

08:07.786 --> 08:09.109
Yeah. It was a catholic school,

08:09.110 --> 08:11.440
so we got suspended for a week. But...

08:11.927 --> 08:13.841
The fact that y'all stuck together

08:13.975 --> 08:15.145
tell me a lot about y'all.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.344
Let me holler at you real quick.

08:16.345 --> 08:17.875
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

08:20.537 --> 08:23.373
I love what you're doing...
some incredible stuff. Thanks.

08:23.374 --> 08:26.305
But I think we could dirty up
the vocals just a little bit.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.275
Okay.

08:27.398 --> 08:29.148
Why don't you come down to A.T.L. with me?

08:29.149 --> 08:31.180
Yeah? Yeah, um...

08:31.181 --> 08:33.335
I mean, I can... I can drive there, yeah.

08:33.582 --> 08:35.277
Really? Drive, man?

08:35.278 --> 08:37.758
I'm recession-proof. I got my own plane.

08:37.759 --> 08:38.729
You d.? You in?

08:38.730 --> 08:39.556
Yeah. Okay. You in?

08:39.557 --> 08:41.839
Yeah, absolutely. A'ight. That's my man.

08:42.437 --> 08:43.741
Let me walk you out.

08:44.388 --> 08:45.381
All right, I'll see you there.

Sorry. No, no, no. Just keep going.
I'm fine.

09:18.186 --> 09:19.156
No.

09:21.465 --> 09:22.803
Come on. What is it?

09:26.907 --> 09:29.955
Hailey told me that she thinks I should...

09:30.138 --> 09:32.532
Try out to be the lead singer of some band.

09:33.801 --> 09:35.175
It's funny she would suggest that,

09:35.176 --> 09:37.545
knowing that we're supposed
to be here writin' every day.

09:37.546 --> 09:38.552
That's what I said.

09:38.553 --> 09:39.701
Are you...

09:40.458 --> 09:41.940
Really considering it?

09:42.350 --> 09:43.335
No.

09:43.598 --> 09:45.492
I don't know. I mean, I
had fun the other night.

09:45.493 --> 09:47.247
But... mm.

09:47.893 --> 09:49.408
I wanna keep doing this.

09:50.870 --> 09:51.792
Yeah.

Could you excuse us for
a minute, please? Sure.

10:41.414 --> 10:43.068
And shut the door. Thank you so much.

10:43.069 --> 10:43.992
Of course.

10:46.974 --> 10:49.386
Rayna, look, I'm sorry,
but Teddy and lamar...

10:49.387 --> 10:51.178
they have just been lying
about me for so long.

10:51.179 --> 10:53.547
It's just... it's time I
start telling the truth.

10:53.548 --> 10:55.363
You're gonna drag my
family through the mud?

10:55.364 --> 10:57.260
I'm just playing the
same games they started.

10:57.261 --> 10:59.495
Well, you know good and
well Teddy's not a cheater.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.783
Yeah, well, I thought so, too...

11:05.596 --> 11:06.759
But you tell me.

11:08.637 --> 11:10.696
If that's not an affair,
then what is it, then?

11:25.069 --> 11:27.752
It's none of your damn
business, is what it is.

12:02.660 --> 12:04.217
I am so sorry.

12:04.218 --> 12:06.841
I thought you said Donelson Pike.
No. It's no worries.

12:06.842 --> 12:07.804
My apologies.

12:07.805 --> 12:09.285
Mom, dad, I'd like you to...

12:09.286 --> 12:11.055
wow! It's really you!

12:11.056 --> 12:12.944
Guys, this is Juliette.

12:12.945 --> 12:15.424
I have every single one of your songs.

12:15.425 --> 12:16.768
You favorite's "drive-thru dreams."

12:16.769 --> 12:18.527
I even tried to find
those pink cowgirl boots

12:18.528 --> 12:19.763
you had in the video.

12:20.042 --> 12:20.924
I loved those.

12:20.925 --> 12:23.029
So this is Dana, your biggest fan.

12:23.030 --> 12:24.587
Well, ni to meet you, Dana.

12:24.588 --> 12:25.607
And those cowboy boots

12:25.608 --> 12:27.948
were definitely one-of-a-kind, for sure.

12:27.949 --> 12:29.835
And it's a pleasure to
meet you, Mrs. Butler.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.216
Lovely. Pleasure, Mr. Butler.

12:32.732 --> 12:34.703
So I was, um, wondering, um...

12:35.237 --> 12:37.652
Do you wanna sing with
us in the choir today?

12:37.653 --> 12:40.421
I asked our director
Mrs. Malcolm, and she said okay.

12:40.422 --> 12:41.408
Dana.

12:41.576 --> 12:43.217
Oh, she didn't come to work, honey.

12:43.218 --> 12:45.595
I think we can find something we both know.

12:49.458 --> 12:50.885
Coleman has an agenda.

12:50.886 --> 12:52.607
Coleman's got pictures.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.264
These do not prove anything.

12:57.462 --> 12:59.064
Tandy, you know, at this point,

12:59.065 --> 13:01.224
you're with my husband more than I am.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.984
Is he having an affair? No.

13:05.630 --> 13:07.719
No. Of course not.

13:09.118 --> 13:11.976
There is nothing going
on between those two.

13:12.316 --> 13:14.490
And who is gonna cheat with
his sister-in-law around?

13:14.491 --> 13:17.011
Because I would scratch
his eyes out myself.

13:17.513 --> 13:18.461
You remember what I told you

13:18.462 --> 13:20.776
when I set you guys up on that first date?

13:21.342 --> 13:23.848
What, that he's the opposite
of Deacon and daddy?

13:24.717 --> 13:25.655
No.

13:26.653 --> 13:29.047
I said that he would make a good husband

13:29.454 --> 13:30.999
and a great father.

13:32.446 --> 13:33.911
And he has.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.720
It's gonna be okay.

13:36.205 --> 13:39.144
Now I gotta go. We're gonna
have a strategy meeting.

13:39.294 --> 13:42.120
We are gonna settle all of this.

13:42.185 --> 13:43.347
Wait a minute.

13:44.185 --> 13:45.371
Who's "we"?

13:48.137 --> 13:49.108
Thanks.

13:50.342 --> 13:51.360
Teddy.

13:52.022 --> 13:53.857
Peggy, what are you doing?
You can't be here.

13:53.858 --> 13:54.974
I have nowhere else to go.

13:54.975 --> 13:57.552
Look, I don't know what to tell
you, but you have to go now.

13:57.553 --> 13:59.995
I told Robert that nothing happened!

13:59.996 --> 14:00.864
He didn't believe me,

14:00.865 --> 14:02.601
and he's flying back
from Hong Kong tonight.

14:02.602 --> 14:05.691
Peggy, please. Just go home
and tell him the truth.

14:05.692 --> 14:06.789
He'll believe you.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.939
You can't just leave me here.

14:10.940 --> 14:12.709
You need to stop this, okay?

14:16.881 --> 14:17.633
I'm sorry.

14:17.634 --> 14:18.500

Hey.

16:16.666 --> 16:17.906
What are you doing here?

16:21.226 --> 16:22.947
That's your record deal champagne.

16:24.219 --> 16:25.908
Dominic Wells wants to work with me,

16:25.909 --> 16:28.352
so I'm flying to Atlanta in the morning.

16:29.181 --> 16:31.160
Well, congratulations, Avery.

16:33.582 --> 16:35.065
Look, I know things are what they are,

16:35.066 --> 16:38.867
but we always said that this
bottle was for when I made it.

16:39.576 --> 16:40.563
And...

16:40.649 --> 16:42.371
I just wanted to say that

16:42.792 --> 16:44.867
we should've opened it
when you got your deal.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.443
So, uh... enjoy.

16:51.481 --> 16:52.724
For both of us.

16:52.889 --> 16:54.019
Thank you.

16:57.002 --> 16:58.451
Good luck in Atlanta.

17:00.249 --> 17:01.383
Thanks.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.659
So what are you all doin' tonight?

17:08.825 --> 17:12.156
Well, I gotta watch some film,
and then dinner with the folks.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.574
I always fix a big Sunday dinner
when our Q.B. is in town.

17:18.909 --> 17:20.598
Would you like to come, Juliette?

17:21.292 --> 17:22.248
Really?

17:23.069 --> 17:25.661
Yes! Absolutely, I'd love to come.

17:25.662 --> 17:27.212
Are you sure? Yes.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.640
Okay. I guess that's a "yes."

17:28.641 --> 17:30.587
You could take that as a "yes."

17:33.710 --> 17:34.429
The most he can do is

17:34.430 --> 17:37.543
float 'em out to the
gossip sites and blogs.

17:37.597 --> 17:39.335
Yeah, well, that's all he needs to do.

17:40.205 --> 17:44.152
Mainstream media will jump on
the bandwagon soon enough.

17:44.685 --> 17:45.671
Hey.

17:46.909 --> 17:48.892
Y'all are having a meeting
to talk about our family,

17:48.893 --> 17:50.556
and you didn't think to include me?

17:50.557 --> 17:52.201
Rayna, you really shouldn't be...

17:52.202 --> 17:55.060
daddy, don't. She's not leavin'.

17:55.257 --> 17:57.757
Rayna, this really isn't anything

17:57.758 --> 17:59.384
you should have to be dealing with.

17:59.385 --> 18:01.192
We have this under control, Rayna.

18:01.193 --> 18:02.760
You don't have it under control.

18:02.761 --> 18:04.248
And you're right, this is not anything

18:04.249 --> 18:05.649
that I should have to be dealing with,

18:05.650 --> 18:06.526
but I do have to deal with it

18:06.527 --> 18:08.196
'cause our children are
gonna have to deal with it

18:08.197 --> 18:11.548
if salacious pictures of their
father, whom they worship,

18:11.549 --> 18:12.871
come out.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.566
You're absolutely right.

18:16.493 --> 18:17.559
All right, look.

18:18.188 --> 18:20.940
If these pictures do come out,
I'll hold a press conference,

18:20.941 --> 18:22.696
and I'll tell the truth about them.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.510
Lamar.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.926
Well, I guess Coleman got tired of waitin'.

18:32.927 --> 18:37.647
Xxx

18:52.717 --> 18:54.643
this is red velvet. You have to try it.

18:54.644 --> 18:56.849
Did you tell Scarlett to join a band?

18:57.543 --> 18:59.586
I.. Suggested she try out for one.

18:59.587 --> 19:01.134
And why would you do that?

19:01.188 --> 19:03.277
Because she's insanely talented.

19:03.539 --> 19:05.102
If she's frontin' some band,

19:05.411 --> 19:07.262
it's not gonna be real easy to write.

19:08.132 --> 19:10.237
You of all people know
that that's not true.

19:10.238 --> 19:12.492
Bands play at night, and
you write during the day.

19:12.493 --> 19:14.869
So you're making decisions about
my partnership with Scarlett

19:14.870 --> 19:16.052
without asking me?

19:16.053 --> 19:19.408
Um, that doesn't sound
possessive and weird at all.

19:22.214 --> 19:24.777
What's weird is that you're trying
to separate Scarlett and me.

19:24.778 --> 19:27.364
That's not what I was doing. Are you sure?

19:27.529 --> 19:28.964
I-I-I...

19:29.305 --> 19:30.464
You don't think I saw

19:30.465 --> 19:31.473
the way you looked at her the other night,

19:31.474 --> 19:33.209
when you were so quick
to come to her rescue?

19:33.210 --> 19:34.754
What, in the bar? That guy was a jerk!

19:34.755 --> 19:36.533
She was doing fine on her own.

19:36.534 --> 19:37.508
I was being a friend.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.951
You were staking a claim.

19:41.910 --> 19:43.691
So this is because you're jealous?

19:43.692 --> 19:44.769
I just...

19:45.253 --> 19:47.696
Prefer that my boyfriend
be more interested in me.

19:48.301 --> 19:49.254
You know?

19:50.861 --> 19:52.073
So there it is.

19:53.485 --> 19:54.253
There what is?

19:54.254 --> 19:57.479
The reason this whole me and you
thing was never gonna work.

19:58.013 --> 19:59.383
Come on. Hailey, wait.

20:00.821 --> 20:02.417
It's over, Gunnar.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.816
It's always been over.

20:13.974 --> 20:14.803
Hi. Hey.

20:15.093 --> 20:16.402
Hey, baby. Come in.

20:16.838 --> 20:17.901
Wow. Hi. Hi.

20:17.902 --> 20:18.761
These are for you.

20:18.779 --> 20:20.317
Oh, thank you. Juliette, these are lovely.

20:20.318 --> 20:21.275
Of course. Thank you.

20:21.998 --> 20:23.625
And these are for you.

20:28.673 --> 20:30.621
Goodness. Look what she gave me!

20:31.377 --> 20:33.727
They're very sweet, but
she can't accept them.

20:33.728 --> 20:35.214
They must've cost a fortune.

20:35.215 --> 20:37.454
No! No, no, no. Please, I insist.

20:37.455 --> 20:39.964
I've never had a sister,
so this is fun for me.

20:40.512 --> 20:41.437
Thank you.

20:41.522 --> 20:42.445
Of course.

20:42.713 --> 20:44.502
Anything I can do to help. Please?

20:53.114 --> 20:54.263
Another day, another dollar.

20:58.764 --> 21:00.664
You're still wondering where I'm
standing with that band thing,

21:00.665 --> 21:01.555
aren't you?

21:01.782 --> 21:02.753
Am I that obvious?

21:03.383 --> 21:04.400
Well, I-I sent 'em the demo.

21:04.401 --> 21:06.141
I doubt anything's gonna
happen with it, though.

21:08.577 --> 21:10.333
Would you stop doin' that?

21:10.929 --> 21:12.637
All they need to do is hear you sing,

21:13.313 --> 21:14.428
and they're gonna want you.

21:14.883 --> 21:15.661
Doubt it.

21:16.413 --> 21:17.768
When you were singing in the bar...

21:21.867 --> 21:23.559
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

21:24.365 --> 21:25.271
No one could.

21:26.889 --> 21:27.717
Gunnar...

21:28.010 --> 21:28.938
Will you...

21:29.996 --> 21:31.208
Please let me finish?

21:33.771 --> 21:34.709
You're amazing.

21:36.028 --> 21:40.087
You have more talent than...
anybody that I know.

21:41.977 --> 21:43.685
Somebody should tell you that every day.

21:44.810 --> 21:45.702
So...

21:47.578 --> 21:48.550
I'm telling you.

21:49.178 --> 21:50.152
That...

21:58.859 --> 21:59.612
I can't do that. I'm sorry.

21:59.613 --> 22:01.288
I've wanted to do that since
the day you walked in here.

22:01.822 --> 22:03.001
You have a girlfriend.

22:03.996 --> 22:04.943
No, I don't.

22:05.066 --> 22:06.661
What? We broke up.

22:07.499 --> 22:09.802
You can't just go around kissing
people 'cause you feel like it.

22:09.803 --> 22:11.205
Well, then... then when should you?

22:11.867 --> 22:12.710
Hey.

22:13.543 --> 22:14.329
How's it goin'?

22:15.276 --> 22:16.104
Hey.

22:17.307 --> 22:18.903
Uh, great. Um...

22:43.369 --> 22:45.014
Is this where Peggy Kenter lives?

22:45.223 --> 22:46.083
Yes.

22:47.694 --> 22:49.350
Look, look. Here she comes.

22:49.351 --> 22:50.819
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

22:51.992 --> 22:54.867
Lady across the street said
Robert came home and found her.

22:55.943 --> 22:57.331
Said she took pills.

23:02.275 --> 23:04.080
Right here. Got it?

23:28.838 --> 23:31.697
Peggy Kenter overdosed on sleeping pills.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.705
She what?

23:33.013 --> 23:34.611
Her husband came home and found her.

23:34.612 --> 23:35.935
Otherwise, she would be dead.

23:37.493 --> 23:39.088
Where'd you hear that? Her neighbor.

23:40.404 --> 23:41.488
What do you mean, her neighbor?

23:43.139 --> 23:44.095
I went over there.

23:47.075 --> 23:47.999
People don't...

23:48.499 --> 23:50.464
Just try to kill themselves...

23:53.301 --> 23:54.241
For no reason.

23:55.303 --> 23:56.302
So what happened?

23:59.349 --> 24:00.586
You had an affair with her, right?

24:00.587 --> 24:01.414
No.

24:04.127 --> 24:05.159
No, I didn't.

24:13.355 --> 24:15.749
God, Rayna, this whole thing
is becoming such a mess.

24:17.354 --> 24:18.134
Yeah.

24:18.712 --> 24:20.551
It was that damn cumberland deal.

24:21.611 --> 24:23.396
My finances were falling apart.

24:23.787 --> 24:26.663
I was doing everything to
keep the thing afloat.

24:30.314 --> 24:32.071
Then Peggy came up with this idea,

24:33.467 --> 24:35.511
and like a fool, I listened to her.

24:36.491 --> 24:38.183
She said that nobody could get hurt.

24:44.864 --> 24:46.633
Nashville's own Ed Fitzgerald, everybody!

24:47.423 --> 24:48.463
Awesome. Awesome.

24:48.464 --> 24:50.603
Tonight, we have a very,
very special treat.

24:50.752 --> 24:52.026
Gunnar and Scarlett, the
bluebird's very own...

24:52.027 --> 24:53.510
Whatever song you want.

24:53.511 --> 24:55.127
Uh, make sure you tip your waitresses.
N-not now.

24:55.128 --> 24:57.268
Have a great evening, guys. Well,
I thought we could do one.

25:08.318 --> 25:09.146
Well, hi.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.218
Uh, tonight,

25:13.054 --> 25:14.093
I'm gonna play you a little song

25:14.094 --> 25:17.129
that me and my partner, uh,
Scarlett are still working on...

25:18.254 --> 25:19.050
I hope.

27:24.690 --> 27:26.155
Will you please just say something?

27:27.552 --> 27:29.197
You stole money from a bank.

27:30.193 --> 27:32.269
Which... which we paid back.

27:34.287 --> 27:37.745
And then you and my father and my sister

27:37.746 --> 27:39.211
bribed an auditor.

27:39.255 --> 27:42.294
Well, we did that to cover up
the borrowing of the money.

27:42.939 --> 27:44.581
These are crimes, Teddy.

27:45.512 --> 27:46.627
I did it to protect our family.

27:46.628 --> 27:48.306
You didn't do it to protect our family.

27:48.307 --> 27:51.344
We never needed that money.
You did it for yourself.

27:53.781 --> 27:54.768
I trusted you.

27:55.445 --> 27:56.320
And you still can.

28:01.604 --> 28:02.737
I don't think so.

28:07.029 --> 28:09.142
You don't have to do that.
I need new boots.

28:09.241 --> 28:11.398
Oh. No, it's the least I can do.

28:11.402 --> 28:14.293
Thank you so much for having me.

28:14.762 --> 28:16.933
Hmm. Well, you didn't give us much choice.

28:18.202 --> 28:19.110
Pardon me?

28:19.657 --> 28:22.085
We've worked hard to build Sean's bran

28:22.298 --> 28:23.849
and we won't see it tarnished

28:23.850 --> 28:26.662
just because he got himself
tangled up in repairing yours.

28:30.408 --> 28:33.305
Listen, Mrs. Butler,

28:33.306 --> 28:34.869
that may be how we met,

28:35.193 --> 28:37.318
but I genuinely care about your son,

28:38.202 --> 28:40.981
and it means a lot to me that
you guys had me here tonight.

28:41.225 --> 28:43.862
I've read about you. I've
read about your mother.

28:44.634 --> 28:46.038
You? This family?

28:46.888 --> 28:48.262
Don't hold your breath, sweetie.

29:10.917 --> 29:11.713
Hey.

29:12.790 --> 29:13.652
You're up early.

29:13.653 --> 29:16.304
So Teddy told me everything,
from cumberland to today.

29:17.652 --> 29:20.340
And you acted like you had no idea.

29:20.341 --> 29:22.004
You asked me if he was having an affair,

29:22.005 --> 29:23.393
and I said that he wasn't.

29:23.974 --> 29:26.514
He embezzled $2 million.

29:26.708 --> 29:27.840
How long have you known?

29:29.686 --> 29:31.713
I didn't find out till the
beginning of the campaign.

29:32.005 --> 29:34.113
Oh. Oh, well, that makes it okay.

29:34.134 --> 29:36.923
No. No. It wasn't supposed to
get this turned upside-down.

29:36.924 --> 29:39.196
I was really trying to save you from this.
It just happened.

29:39.197 --> 29:41.015
It didn't happen. Y'all made this happen.

29:41.244 --> 29:42.364
Was that all part of the plan?

29:42.365 --> 29:44.359
"Oh, Rayna'll just believe
whatever Tandy tells her"?

29:44.364 --> 29:46.168
That's not true, and you know it.

29:46.445 --> 29:48.551
I don't know anything at this point,

29:48.845 --> 29:51.879
except that my husband's a thief, I guess.

29:51.975 --> 29:54.339
No. And you're just like daddy.

29:54.829 --> 29:56.213
Y'all just deserve each other.
I mean, we...

29:56.453 --> 29:59.108
no! That's not true. You... don't bother.

30:04.187 --> 30:05.319
Hey. Hey.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.447
I'm sorry just to, you know, drop by.

30:07.448 --> 30:09.570
Nah, come on in. I was
gonna call you this week.

30:10.025 --> 30:13.542
So looks like the duet's up
to number 15 on the charts.

30:13.543 --> 30:15.803
Yeah. Guess you and Rayna
are gonna have to do

30:15.804 --> 30:16.987
a whole album together now, right?

30:16.988 --> 30:20.425
Oh. Very funny. No, thank you.

30:21.661 --> 30:23.192
It did get me thinking, though,

30:23.692 --> 30:25.335
that it was so easy to write with you,

30:25.853 --> 30:27.113
and I think we should do it again.

30:27.662 --> 30:28.977
Let's do it. Okay.

30:29.364 --> 30:31.417
Although I might be out of
town for a little while.

30:31.418 --> 30:35.398
I just got an offer to play
guitar for the revel kings.

30:35.739 --> 30:37.126
The revel kings?

30:38.027 --> 30:40.456
Are you kidding me? Oh, my God!
That's amazing!

30:40.715 --> 30:42.808
Deacon, you're gonna...
you're gonna do it, right?

30:42.809 --> 30:44.280
Maybe. I'm thinking about it.

30:44.363 --> 30:45.978
You're thinking about it? Yeah.

30:45.979 --> 30:47.958
Well, what is there to even think about?

30:48.810 --> 30:50.250
I don't know. You know, lots of things.

30:50.251 --> 30:52.741
It's a big tour, lot of dates.
We'll see. Uh-huh.

30:53.563 --> 30:55.447
Look, that's not why I'm here. Look.

30:58.826 --> 30:59.862
It's from your mom.

31:03.896 --> 31:04.979
Where'd you get that?

31:05.480 --> 31:07.798
From rehab. I've been going
around, checking on her,

31:07.799 --> 31:08.916
seeing if she's doing all right.

31:09.783 --> 31:11.575
No. No, I don't want that.

31:11.576 --> 31:13.749
You know, and I don't
want you talking to her.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.004
Juliette, look, honey, she's
the only family you got

31:16.005 --> 31:16.963
in the whole world.

31:17.238 --> 31:19.650
Uh, I... why is she sending you letters?

31:19.651 --> 31:21.379
Because you won't answer her calls.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.162
You know, I... she wants to
make things right, you know?

31:24.163 --> 31:26.319
She's... I think if you read
the letter, you'll see.

31:26.435 --> 31:28.385
I'll see what? Huh?

31:28.644 --> 31:31.443
I'll be reminded that I had
to eat dry pancake mix

31:31.444 --> 31:33.345
because all our money went up her nose?

31:36.758 --> 31:37.744
Or that...

31:38.629 --> 31:42.527
My first kiss was from one
of her creepy boyfriends?

31:45.290 --> 31:47.440
I know how important family is, Deacon,

31:48.806 --> 31:50.879
because I never had one.

31:51.221 --> 31:52.324
I'm sorry, sweetie.

31:53.705 --> 31:54.835
But she is, too.

31:55.544 --> 31:58.979
Just leave. Please.

32:06.728 --> 32:07.666
You know what, Deacon?

32:08.134 --> 32:10.102
Maybe if you spent a
little less time meddling

32:10.103 --> 32:13.060
and more time fixing your own problems,

32:13.352 --> 32:16.115
you would see what a fool you are

32:16.742 --> 32:18.897
for even having to think about that tour.

32:35.492 --> 32:36.655
Can I talk to you a minute?

32:38.724 --> 32:39.598
What about?

32:41.602 --> 32:43.964
About stuff you can't take
back even if you want to.

32:46.691 --> 32:48.273
Who said anything about taking it back?

32:50.019 --> 32:52.078
Scarlett, I don't... I
don't regret kissing you.

32:59.123 --> 33:00.768
Gunnar, I'm so confused.

33:03.252 --> 33:04.367
Look, we, uh...

33:05.314 --> 33:07.740
We should keep writing, uh,
Jeanne's new songs, so...

33:07.741 --> 33:09.964
no, I know that Jeanne likes
it when we write together,

33:09.965 --> 33:12.795
but our deals... are separate,

33:12.796 --> 33:15.289
and I just need a little bit of time

33:15.642 --> 33:16.505
at the moment.

33:16.509 --> 33:18.111
I'm... just a mess. What?

33:20.130 --> 33:21.230
Oh, come on.

33:22.771 --> 33:23.791
Separate...

33:25.315 --> 33:27.023
Cool, fine, whatever.

33:28.725 --> 33:30.172
Good luck with your new band.

33:40.842 --> 33:41.686
Thanks.

33:44.505 --> 33:45.845
Renaissance man.

33:47.096 --> 33:48.628
How you like that vintage?

33:49.225 --> 33:51.109
I have to admit, I could get used to this.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.292
And I'm really serious, though,
about working with you.

33:55.130 --> 33:57.220
Thanks. It means a lot.

33:57.241 --> 34:00.553
But like I said, serious
about working with you.

34:01.951 --> 34:02.811
Just you.

34:04.943 --> 34:06.303
I don't... I don't understand.

34:06.304 --> 34:09.594
I mean, uh, what about my band?

34:09.594 --> 34:11.830
Come on, man. We'll build you up,

34:11.833 --> 34:13.783
and then you can get another set of guys.

34:16.344 --> 34:17.221
Right...

34:17.770 --> 34:20.793
But I've already... I've already picked.

34:20.793 --> 34:24.085
I mean, J.T. and I go way back.
You know that.

34:24.697 --> 34:26.565
I ain't talkin' about going backwards.

34:27.194 --> 34:29.190
I'm talking about going forwards, man.
Come on.

34:34.719 --> 34:36.342
Ah, ah. D-don't.

34:37.947 --> 34:40.150
Don't kill your career before it starts.

35:02.497 --> 35:04.764
After all these years, you
can still jump that wall.

35:08.417 --> 35:09.388
Thanks for calling.

35:10.337 --> 35:11.757
I just wanna make sure you're okay.

35:12.562 --> 35:13.549
Yeah, I am.

35:16.144 --> 35:17.230
So it's true, then?

35:18.208 --> 35:19.071
Sort of.

35:20.386 --> 35:21.356
It's complicated.

35:23.027 --> 35:26.750
Complicated. That's the last
thing I ever thought he was.

35:29.921 --> 35:31.425
Well, we still got two daughters

35:31.426 --> 35:32.878
who think he hung the moon.

35:37.092 --> 35:37.998
Anything I can do?

35:40.180 --> 35:41.040
No.

35:42.141 --> 35:43.946
How you doing? What's going on?

35:44.691 --> 35:49.393
Well, just got asked to go on
tour with the revel kings.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.430
That's the real deal.

35:52.902 --> 35:53.959
That's what they tell me.

35:54.422 --> 35:56.341
Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime.

35:56.342 --> 35:57.346
They say that, too.

35:57.718 --> 35:58.818
Yeah. You gonna do it?

36:00.806 --> 36:02.082
I don't know. What do you think?

36:05.413 --> 36:06.405
I think you gotta go off

36:06.406 --> 36:09.074
and see what's around the next bend.

36:11.237 --> 36:12.401
I guess we both do.

36:14.135 --> 36:14.994
Yeah.

36:16.229 --> 36:17.637
Well, you know, I know those girls think

36:17.638 --> 36:20.019
that Teddy makes the world go round,

36:20.020 --> 36:23.379
but... they wouldn't even
have a world without you.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.099
What you're seeing in those pictures

36:36.100 --> 36:37.984
is nothing more than an old friend

36:38.004 --> 36:40.496
trying to help another
navigate a tough patch.

36:41.972 --> 36:44.980
Sadly, her accidental
overdose, which followed

36:44.981 --> 36:46.933
this relentless, unwarranted
media attention,

36:46.934 --> 36:48.355
was an outgrowth of that.

36:49.145 --> 36:51.041
Now our thoughts... oh, my God.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.957
And prayers are with Peggy Kenter...

36:55.713 --> 36:57.453
Are with Peggy Kenter and her family,

36:57.454 --> 36:59.004
and we hope for a speedy recovery.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.816
Would you... would you please excuse me?

37:00.817 --> 37:03.164
You all know my lovely wife, Rayna James.

37:10.021 --> 37:11.090
Good afternoon.

37:12.437 --> 37:13.733
I apologize for my lateness.

37:13.734 --> 37:16.309
I was, uh, picking up our
daughters from school,

37:16.310 --> 37:17.618
you know, as parents do.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.746
Teddy did that for us for years
while I was out on tour,

37:21.817 --> 37:24.725
while he was juggling his
career and his business.

37:25.609 --> 37:28.757
He's a good father, and
he's a good husband,

37:29.882 --> 37:32.803
and he's also a wonderful
cook, thank goodness for me.

37:35.769 --> 37:39.027
What he is not is a cheater.

37:41.753 --> 37:43.908
I've been married to this man for 12 years.

37:45.081 --> 37:46.612
I believe in his love for me.

37:48.121 --> 37:50.068
I believe in his love for our children,

37:50.330 --> 37:52.212
and these pictures don't do anything

37:53.426 --> 37:55.415
other than show the
desperation of some people

37:55.416 --> 37:56.901
who are trying to bring us down.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.334
So I'm not gonna dignify 'em
with any further comment.

38:01.335 --> 38:02.306
Thank you.

38:03.483 --> 38:05.134
Miss Jaymes, a question...

38:06.707 --> 38:08.391
thank you for doing this.

38:09.889 --> 38:11.148
I did it for our daughters.

38:14.921 --> 38:15.874
This way, please.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.620
Good, good, good, good.

38:20.621 --> 38:22.116
I'm glad you guys are sitting down.

38:22.363 --> 38:24.503
So... how's the writing going?

38:25.226 --> 38:27.062
A little slow. Real good.

38:27.394 --> 38:29.538
Well, you're gonna need to crank it up,

38:29.539 --> 38:32.010
because we have officially
received an offer

38:32.011 --> 38:34.274
to put one of your songs on hold.

38:34.275 --> 38:35.536
Seriously? Mm-hmm.

38:35.845 --> 38:36.960
Uh, what song?

38:37.140 --> 38:38.486
"Fade into you." Yeah.

38:38.571 --> 38:40.823
Oh, I-it's not a done deal yet,

38:40.824 --> 38:44.009
but it doesn't mean that this
isn't your first big break,

38:44.010 --> 38:46.149
and something to be very excited about

38:46.313 --> 38:48.021
and, uh, something to...

38:48.311 --> 38:49.813
Celebrate. Whoa.

38:50.986 --> 38:54.182
I suggest a toast to both of you.

38:54.456 --> 38:55.925
I knew it when I met ya.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.765
I knew it when I heard your first song,

38:57.835 --> 39:01.478
and now I know it for sure.

39:01.721 --> 39:05.973
Let us toast to successful partnerships.

39:07.531 --> 39:08.343
Cheers.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.732
"Goes numb," right? That's it, man.
Hey, Cy.

39:18.733 --> 39:22.393
Hey, good news, man. Deacon here
already knows most of our songs.

39:22.412 --> 39:24.036
Yeah, it helps that they all sound alike.

39:24.314 --> 39:26.039
Oh, man, that's cold.

39:26.040 --> 39:27.427
Yeah, that's very cold, man.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.156
Well... what's it gonna be, man?

39:32.167 --> 39:34.275
I guess I don't leave now, I'm never gonna.

39:34.857 --> 39:35.376
Let's do it.

39:35.377 --> 39:36.781
Yes! Yeah.

39:37.418 --> 39:38.359
Well, all right.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.108
There you go.

39:45.465 --> 39:47.366
It's from vichy... the

39:50.882 --> 39:52.754
and rock 'n' roll.

39:52.755 --> 39:53.906

Now look, Rayna.

40:15.291 --> 40:17.879
The fact is, people are loving the duet.

40:18.170 --> 40:19.163
So it seems.

40:19.164 --> 40:20.777
And we couldn't be more pleased

40:20.778 --> 40:22.967
with the way the single's performing.

40:23.163 --> 40:25.543
It's shot both of you to

A.S.A.P., hopefully.
