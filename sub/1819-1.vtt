02:29.941 --> 02:31.943
Oh, shit.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.018
Son of a bitch.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.495
Oh. Oh.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.659
Oh.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.632
Happy fucking birthday.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.518
Tell me you're the good guys.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.819
What the hell is going on here?

05:18.985 --> 05:20.658
Did my girlfriend
put you up to this?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.324
Am I being punked?
Huh?

05:28.286 --> 05:31.665
¿Tu hable inglés?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.176
Cómo se dice,

05:35.335 --> 05:38.009
"I'm freezing my balls,
so I want to get the fuck out of here"?

05:38.171 --> 05:41.391
Uh, do you speak English?

05:41.550 --> 05:44.019
English? Do you?
Do you speak English?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.679
Anybody?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.519
Eh?

05:49.140 --> 05:51.313
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.899
Oh! Oh.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.939
Yeah.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.326
Okay, I can see that you--

05:59.484 --> 06:01.157
you got a problem with me,

06:01.319 --> 06:04.289
so why don't we...
find an interpreter

06:04.447 --> 06:06.870
and we'll just--
we'll just take it outside?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.626
- Okay?
Mm-hmm.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.254
Help! Help!
This is a mistake.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.882
- Oh!
- Bravo.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.299
Help!
Somebody help me!

06:18.461 --> 06:21.135
Help! Help!

06:24.759 --> 06:27.979
I don't know what this is about,
but you got the wrong guy.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.937
Ask the manager.
Call the czar.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.818
Find a-- a comrade
who speaks English.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.730
People know I'm here. My girlfriend's
waiting at our table right now.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.233
My shrimp-fucking-scampi
is getting cold.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.903
I'm supposed to be blowing out
the candles. It's my birthday.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.071
Don't you have any compassion?

06:46.615 --> 06:48.538
Money.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.127
- Money?
- Money.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.287
Money.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.082
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:57.709 --> 07:00.258
My wallet.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.514
You took my goddamn wallet.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.640
There was 400 in cash in there.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.097
You got my credit cards.
Good luck with those.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.934
How-- how about ATM?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.939
Huh?
We take a drive.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.817
We go to the ATM--
A-T-M.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.023
I can--

07:16.186 --> 07:19.110
I can get you more--
easy, "Conan."

07:25.403 --> 07:27.497
So? Let's go.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.408
What-- what do you want?
Passwords? My Social?

07:30.575 --> 07:32.122
You want to steal my identity?
You can have it.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.708
Robert "Shit Luck" Saunders.
Have a merry fucking life.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.890
Well, sounds like you two dildos
are working this out.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.848
You can't rush a good idea,
especially if it's--

08:01.147 --> 08:02.524
Nice to meet you.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.248
Let me out of here!

08:26.715 --> 08:28.968
Shit.

08:32.136 --> 08:35.607
You're a shit magnet.
Always have been.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.088
Hello?

10:30.255 --> 10:31.632
- Sam?
- What?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.800
Who is this? ls Sam there?

10:33.967 --> 10:35.514
Wrong number.
Good bye.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.771
Don't hang up. Stop.
You need me.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.644
Why do I need you?

10:40.807 --> 10:44.482
'Cause anyone holding this phone
is in a shitload of trouble. Am I right?

10:44.644 --> 10:47.989
- Maybe.
- Now who are you?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.321
I'm trapped in a freezer,

10:50.483 --> 10:53.236
Cafe Volga,
Brighton Beach Boulevard, Brooklyn.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.826
I found a phone here
lying on the floor.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.996
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.786
I'm locked in here.

11:00.952 --> 11:03.000
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.794
NYPD.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.089
You're the police?

11:09.252 --> 11:10.970
I'm starting a trace.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.881
You don't need a trace.
Get someone over here now.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.845
I-- I-- I'm locked
in a fucking meat locker.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.385
Give me your full name.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.724
Robert James Saunders.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.264
And your Social?

11:20.430 --> 11:22.683
Yeah, right.
What kind of scam is this?

11:22.849 --> 11:24.317
Give me the last four digits.

11:24.475 --> 11:26.773
Six-four-three-nine.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.860
- Are you there?
- I'm here.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.870
Are you sure you're a cop?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.282
Detective Al Dorian,

11:38.448 --> 11:39.916
Narcotics, NYPD.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.076
Yeah, well, Detective,

11:42.243 --> 11:44.917
you know, it's--
it's 37 degrees in here,

11:45.079 --> 11:47.707
so I hate to complain, but
if you can get here a little quicker,

11:47.874 --> 11:49.217
I'd really appreciate it.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.343
I'm being held captive
by two goons.

11:51.502 --> 11:52.924
What do they want?

11:53.087 --> 11:55.465
Money.
They keep asking me questions,

11:55.632 --> 11:57.475
but fuck if I can understand.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.511
They-- they took my wallet.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.896
This whole thing is insane.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.602
How did you end up there?

12:03.765 --> 12:05.392
It's my birthday,
if you can believe it.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.061
I was having dinner at Cafe Volga
with my girlfriend.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.901
I hear they have a good steak.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.407
Yeah, well, here's a hot tip for you--
stay away from the bathroom.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.738
I was taking a leak and one of these
clowns sucker-punches me.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.744
I saw stars and woke up here.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.076
Who was your date at Volga?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.411
Christina Welch,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.622
28, red hair, hot as hell,

12:23.785 --> 12:26.083
sitting at a deuce by the bar.
Can't miss her.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.250
Christina. I'll have someone
speak with her if she's still there.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.588
She'll know exactly
how long you've been missing.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.755
The name Sam Gurov
mean anything to you?

12:34.921 --> 12:37.015
- No.
- You sure?

12:37.173 --> 12:38.925
Yeah, I'm sure. Why?

12:39.092 --> 12:42.596
As of now, he is missing
and you're holding his phone.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.935
Can you describe
the two men holding you?

12:45.098 --> 12:47.226
Yeah, one's about 5'11",

12:47.392 --> 12:49.986
spongy hair, kind of looks like
James Caan on a bad day,

12:50.144 --> 12:52.272
good suit, bad cigars.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.782
The other one's a dead ringer
for Conan the Barbarian.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.194
He's got a star tattoo
on the back of his neck.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.533
They're Russian, I think.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.324
You have an eye for detail,
Bobby.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.163
Robert, not Bobby.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.918
What do you do
for a living?

13:06.077 --> 13:08.125
- A mechanic.
- Right.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.290
You don't believe me?

13:10.456 --> 13:12.424
You blame me?
Who'd trust a mechanic?

13:12.583 --> 13:15.587
All right, all right. But I happen to be
one of the good ones.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.551
A mechanic, huh?

13:17.714 --> 13:20.558
Pick that up in a machine
shop at Rikers?

13:20.717 --> 13:23.311
Robert James Saunders,

13:23.469 --> 13:25.267
two years for assault.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.977
That you, Bobby?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.317
Long time ago.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.729
Is this another mistake?

13:34.022 --> 13:36.320
He swung first.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.325
That's what they all say.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.328
So my mother said.
It was my stepfather.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.160
Just so you know, Bobby,

13:43.323 --> 13:45.997
Sam Gurov was undercover,
off the grid.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.038
Now if SWATs break through that door,
there's gonna be questions about Sam.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.796
They need fast answers.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.582
If you bullshit
or withhold in any way,

13:52.749 --> 13:54.843
you'll wish to Christ
they left you in your box.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.503
Hold on.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.514
You may be in a freezer, pal,
but not in Cafe Volga.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.346
- What?
- You're not in Cafe Volga.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.931
I'm in there now.
I've been through the whole place,

14:05.094 --> 14:06.641
including the freezer.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.852
Robert, what's going on?

14:09.015 --> 14:11.518
Robert.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.186
Robert, are you there?

14:20.693 --> 14:23.822
You know, I wasn't quite done
with my call.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.883
You two need a room?
You know, I'm starting to sense

14:43.049 --> 14:45.768
some obvious sexual tension
between you two,

14:45.927 --> 14:47.099
and I like it.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.389
No, really,
you make a nice couple.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.774
You should be together.
You know what you should do?

14:51.933 --> 14:53.776
Move to Woodstock,

14:53.935 --> 14:56.313
adopt a nice little Congolese baby

14:56.479 --> 14:58.698
and be happy.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.405
Right? What's more important
than love?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.705
Need a bank?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.258
Nyet.

15:47.989 --> 15:50.242
I apologize
for their lack of manners.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.410
- Oh.
- I don't have much time tonight.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.579
And neither do you in this cold.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.589
Finally someone who can
speak English around here.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.969
Are you shy around women?

16:06.132 --> 16:09.636
Only women
as ugly as these two.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.813
You've been here about 30 minutes.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.349
Feels like 30 days.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.768
Well, Robert Saunders,

16:16.934 --> 16:19.107
at this temperature,

16:19.270 --> 16:22.945
most men last
between three and four hours,

16:23.107 --> 16:24.700
just so you know.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.203
If you know who I am,
then you know this is a mistake.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.238
I-- I-- I was having dinner
at Cafe Volga.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.079
Please. Perhaps I know
more than you think.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.333
Then you don't need me.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.461
It's not that easy.
We still have to talk.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.965
Fine, then let's step outside
for a nice cup of hot cocoa.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.340
The money.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.843
You took my money.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.797
Why does it have to be like this?

16:45.963 --> 16:49.433
Because these two dumbasses
picked the wrong guy.

16:49.592 --> 16:52.186
I'm afraid we are stuck in here
for a while longer.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.518
All right, for you,
I'll stay just for a little bit,

16:54.680 --> 16:57.149
because I'm supposed to meet
some friends downtown.

16:57.308 --> 17:00.653
So, maybe give me your number

17:00.811 --> 17:03.655
and, you know, we can hook up,
have some borscht.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.041
- You must be getting cold.
- You think?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.877
Tell me where the money is.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.087
I spent it.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.799
Oh, for Chrissake,

17:24.961 --> 17:27.384
- I'm a mechanic.
- I don't believe you.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.845
Well, neither did that cop
I was just on the phone with,

17:30.007 --> 17:31.554
but he traced the call anyway.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.845
They're gonna be here
any minute.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.036
We don't believe the trace worked.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.744
- We'll see.
- I don't hear any sirens.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.204
They're sneaky that way.

17:56.367 --> 17:59.371
Don't fuck with us, Robert.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.414
They're not coming.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.879
You know it. I know it.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.043
If you don't give us the money,

18:06.210 --> 18:08.087
you will freeze to death.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.178
Honey, I've been to a Giants-Bills
game in December.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.432
This is nothing.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.721
Your shivering will increase.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.888
You'll also get confused

18:18.055 --> 18:19.898
and have trouble concentrating.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.936
It may get so bad
that you'll bite your tongue off.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.821
In the final stages of hypothermia,

18:25.980 --> 18:27.903
you will develop
terminal burrowing.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.284
Terminal burrowing?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.070
Do we get to cuddle?

18:32.236 --> 18:35.410
It's a self-protective behavior.

18:35.573 --> 18:38.497
You will crawl into a small corner

18:38.659 --> 18:40.832
and wait there to die.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.089
The good news is

18:43.247 --> 18:46.126
you won't even care.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.678
How much money
do I have, by the way?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.805
Eight million dollars.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.137
Eight million?
Shit, I'm rich.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.517
Robert,

18:55.676 --> 18:57.644
I'm trying to help you.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.022
Help me what? Piss ice cubes?
You've got the wrong guy.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.558
Someone saw you.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.852
Oh, damn it.
Don't you get it?

19:04.018 --> 19:07.147
It's some dude who looks like me,
but it's not me.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.283
- Were you alone at Cafe Volga?
- I was on a date.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.409
Oh, maybe she knows
where the money is.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.821
Ask her. She's there right now
with a dozen cops

19:14.987 --> 19:17.331
looking for one of their own--
a detective.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.492
What do you know about that?

19:21.118 --> 19:23.212
Oh, shit.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.503
When did the money disappear?

19:26.666 --> 19:29.670
Sometime between
9:00 and 10:00 tonight.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.961
Okay, okay.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.971
Um, before we went
to the Volga,

19:33.130 --> 19:35.303
we stopped at Gina's on 3rd
for a drink.

19:35.466 --> 19:38.561
I-- I paid with a--
I paid with a credit card.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.518
Maybe I-- maybe I still
have the receipt.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.144
Oh, shit. Please.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.234
Come on, come on,
come on.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.826
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Gina's.
That proves it.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.986
Take a look.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.502
Well, the time on this shows

20:03.661 --> 20:05.504
you closed out at 9:14.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.792
Well, we stayed for another round.
My girlfriend paid.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.427
- Oh, such a gentleman.
- It's my birthday. She wanted to.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.508
Go to Gina's.
Talk to the bartender--

20:13.671 --> 20:16.641
- Will or William, something like that.
- We don't have time for this.

20:16.799 --> 20:19.018
- Then you're gonna lose your man.
- You are the man.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.474
Oh, shit. This is gonna be
a long-ass night.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.355
It's not gonna be
a long night, Robert.

20:23.514 --> 20:25.357
Certainly not for you.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.393
A man is coming to get
his money.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.814
If you're still here and the money
is not, it'll be unpleasant.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.857
It's already unpleasant,
cupcake.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.572
Can't he come a little sooner?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.917
Alisa.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.423
Are you a Gemini, by chance?
Because I'm a Sagittarius,

20:49.582 --> 20:53.052
and we're supposed to be
pretty compatible.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.265
Did you guys feel that?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.347
She likes me.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.391
I feel like it's something I said.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.936
I'm starting to feel like
you don't like me or something.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.445
Am I wrong?

21:13.939 --> 21:15.691
Oh, that's awful.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.031
Ooh! You missed.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.792
Argh! Argh!

22:46.448 --> 22:48.450
Oh, shit.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.509
Oh!

25:08.590 --> 25:11.184
- Oh, shit. Fuck.
- Help.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.721
- You scared the fuck out of me.
- Help me.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.562
Hey, man, you're shot.

25:21.729 --> 25:24.198
- Help me up.
- No, no, no. Careful. Careful.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.358
You might start bleeding again.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.902
Let me guess--

25:28.068 --> 25:30.537
Sam Gurov?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.698
Detective Sam Gurov?

25:34.241 --> 25:36.084
I found your phone.
Dorian called.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.620
Dorian?

25:37.786 --> 25:40.039
- Let's call him back.
- No, no, easy, dude.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.207
The Russians grabbed it
before he got a solid trace.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.468
They would have
been here by now.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.092
- Okay, help me out of here.
- Oh, so I can watch you bleed out?

25:51.258 --> 25:53.010
What, are you a doctor?
Get me out.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.896
Oh, just like a fucking cop,
always giving orders, huh?

25:56.055 --> 25:58.057
Come on.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.902
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.571
There you go.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.074
If I move, I'm dead.
If I don't, I'm dead.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.610
How long
have you been in here?

26:09.777 --> 26:11.905
No idea.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.073
Why did they bring you here?

26:14.239 --> 26:16.583
The Russians asked me
some questions,

26:16.742 --> 26:19.120
the kind that hurt.

26:21.288 --> 26:24.462
I'm dying of thirst.
You got anything to drink in here?

26:24.625 --> 26:26.753
Yeah...

26:52.277 --> 26:53.904
That's good.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.948
Thank you.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.868
Do you think these guys
are Russian mafia?

26:59.034 --> 27:01.082
You know anything about that?

27:01.245 --> 27:04.044
How can you be in here
and not know who these people are?

27:04.206 --> 27:06.959
- They think I took their money.
- I suggest you give it back.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.628
I didn't take it.

27:08.794 --> 27:10.512
They ain't the type to make
those kind of mistakes.

27:10.671 --> 27:13.515
- Well, they did tonight.
- If you say so.

27:13.674 --> 27:15.927
So you know these guys?

27:16.093 --> 27:18.061
They say someone's coming
for their money--

27:18.220 --> 27:20.473
someone I should be scared of.
Is it the boss,

27:20.639 --> 27:22.482
someone I can talk to,
or what?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.894
You don't want to talk to him.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.563
Oleg is the
"rukovodstvo."

27:30.190 --> 27:32.409
I was--

27:32.568 --> 27:34.696
I was working my way up
to meet him, take him down.

27:34.862 --> 27:37.331
In six months, I never met him.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.126
He lives in a fortress somewhere,
never leaves.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.958
Despite all that, some fuck
almost whacked Oleg yesterday.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.377
Really? Who? You?

27:49.543 --> 27:51.216
No.

27:51.378 --> 27:54.348
One of his own,
some trigger from the old country.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.383
Oleg was scared.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.302
He started moving money,
lots of it.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.641
Eight million came up from Miami,

28:00.804 --> 28:03.148
and then it vanished.

28:03.307 --> 28:06.652
When the fingers started pointing,
they landed on me.

28:11.982 --> 28:14.485
This whole thing
doesn't make any fucking sense.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.029
What did Dorian say?

28:17.196 --> 28:20.541
Well, he started looking for you
in Cafe Volga,

28:20.699 --> 28:22.542
but he doesn't know
where we are now.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.374
Any ideas?

28:24.536 --> 28:26.538
Robert...

28:28.290 --> 28:30.384
you are fucked.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.045
They are going to kill you,
money or not.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.214
There's nothing you can say
that's gonna make these guys

28:35.380 --> 28:37.678
park your ass on a curb
and drive away.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.310
Even if you can prove
you got nothing to do with nothing,

28:40.469 --> 28:42.221
you've seen their faces.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.389
You're a risk.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.405
Oh, what's the story with that?

28:52.564 --> 28:55.238
Oh, I knocked it open.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.073
You've been busy.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.160
There's no getting through these walls.
They all have steel backing.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.290
It probably doesn't lead
to anywhere anyway.

29:02.449 --> 29:04.702
There's a duct
inside the housing,

29:04.868 --> 29:06.586
but, you know,
I'm thinking it connects

29:06.745 --> 29:09.840
to those circulating fans
above the door. I'm not sure.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.421
You know how much money
these creeps have?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.427
Billions--

29:14.586 --> 29:17.214
oil, minerals,

29:17.381 --> 29:20.476
credit scams, whores, Internet.

29:20.634 --> 29:23.228
It's ridiculous how bent they get
over eight million.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.981
That kind of money
is nothing to them.

29:26.139 --> 29:29.734
"Nichto"-- that's Russian
for "nothing."

29:34.731 --> 29:36.733
Shit.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.791
Hey, what do you know
about this Alisa chick?

29:44.950 --> 29:46.952
What's her story?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.792
I think she's kind of into me.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.797
She's a mule with a great ass.

29:50.956 --> 29:51.957
I'll say.

29:52.124 --> 29:55.594
She's also a punching bag
for Oleg's son Vadim.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.754
Who knows?

29:57.921 --> 29:59.923
In their world, maybe that's love.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.976
What about the guy
with the cigars?

30:03.135 --> 30:05.012
Stepan--

30:05.178 --> 30:08.899
smart, ambitious, dangerous.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.525
"Conan"?

30:10.684 --> 30:12.937
Kiril--

30:13.103 --> 30:15.231
what you see
is what you get.

30:15.397 --> 30:18.321
Who else is there? Anybody?

30:18.483 --> 30:20.485
I had someone working
on the inside.

30:20.652 --> 30:24.657
Whoa. What's his name?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.167
Boyka.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.000
Maybe he took the money.
Where is he?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.290
Face down
in a pool of blood.

30:33.457 --> 30:34.709
Who killed him?

30:34.875 --> 30:37.219
S-Stepan.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.720
Figures.

30:38.879 --> 30:42.224
Just keep hitting those fans.
I'm dying, for crying out loud, come on.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.225
Hey!

30:51.391 --> 30:54.361
You know where I really want to go
when we get out of this hellhole?

30:54.519 --> 30:57.523
The Dominican Republic.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.784
I really like
Spanish women, man.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.953
Maybe we'll meet there
for a drink, huh, Sam?

31:19.836 --> 31:21.713
Sam. Sam.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.759
Sam, open your eyes.
Wake up. Wake up.

31:24.925 --> 31:26.302
Wake up.
Open your eyes.

31:26.468 --> 31:29.096
They are open. I'm too cold.

31:29.262 --> 31:31.811
And I'm tired,
too fucking tired.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.352
Okay, okay, okay.

31:35.519 --> 31:38.398
Uh, come on.
Come on.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.565
- What are you doing?
- Putting you back on your shelf.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.029
No.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.444
Come on.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.862
Okay.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.326
Come on.
There you go.

31:47.489 --> 31:50.083
Okay, get in there.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.745
Okay. Good.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.967
Home sweet home.

31:59.126 --> 32:00.594
Okay.

32:02.712 --> 32:03.759
Hey...

32:03.922 --> 32:05.890
the Dominican Republic
sounds nice.

32:06.049 --> 32:08.643
Yeah, man,
Dominican Republic.

32:11.054 --> 32:12.647
Okay.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.184
Sit tight.
Don't say a word.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.227
Quiet as a corpse.

32:17.394 --> 32:19.863
Good. Okay.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.128
I knocked out a big one.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.548
Tropical paradise.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.426
You scare me a little bit.
You know that?

33:24.419 --> 33:25.921
Oh.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.340
What the hell was that for?

33:28.507 --> 33:32.432
It's good for the cold,
to help you keep awake.

33:32.594 --> 33:34.642
You can turn up the heat,
you know.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.852
The food would spoil.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.648
Ow.
What is this?

33:40.810 --> 33:42.608
Where do you think
you are, Robert?

33:42.771 --> 33:44.273
You tell me.

33:44.439 --> 33:46.567
You are in a coffin.

33:48.902 --> 33:52.247
Do you know how many people
these walls have seen?

33:52.405 --> 33:55.625
You're not the first
and you won't be the last.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.627
No more lies
about the money.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.039
There is only one way out--

34:00.205 --> 34:01.878
the truth.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.135
I am sick of asking you
where the fucking money is.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.717
Ow.

34:11.132 --> 34:13.429
What, is it your money
or something?

34:14.886 --> 34:16.058
No.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.018
So what's in this for you?

34:18.181 --> 34:20.434
It keeps me alive.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.476
You're responsible?

34:22.643 --> 34:25.237
It's my head on the block
with theirs and yours.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.741
Huh. Sorry to hear that.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.243
- Then speak.
- May I?

34:32.279 --> 34:35.248
How does a beautiful girl like
you end up in the mob?

34:35.407 --> 34:37.455
Oh, I know--

34:37.617 --> 34:39.369
you have to fuck
all the wrong guys.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.540
Not this time.

34:43.706 --> 34:46.755
There are many ways
into this work, Robert.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.922
Yeah, well, you should have read
the fine print, sweetheart.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.600
It wouldn't have
made a difference.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.431
I was young.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.599
I liked parties,
and passed easily

34:59.764 --> 35:02.517
through borders and airports--

35:02.684 --> 35:04.686
the perfect courier.

35:04.853 --> 35:08.278
So wait, you--
you carried the eight million?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.863
And I always delivered.

35:11.026 --> 35:14.405
But that won't matter to the boss
when he arrives.

35:14.571 --> 35:17.370
Hmm, no worries.
I'm sure a pretty girl like you

35:17.532 --> 35:19.785
has this guy's ear...

35:19.951 --> 35:21.953
or something lower.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.213
I don't understand you,
Robert.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.047
Why is money more important
to you than life?

35:32.213 --> 35:33.965
Hey, that was good.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.884
You almost looked
like you cared.

35:36.051 --> 35:39.305
No, really, I can see how good
you must be dancing through borders.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.473
But the reality of the situation is,
sweetheart,

35:41.640 --> 35:44.814
you and I both know I'm not
getting out of this freezer alive,

35:44.976 --> 35:47.399
so enough of the bullshit.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.993
Then save me, Robert.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.827
Please save me.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.284
Baby...

36:01.451 --> 36:03.920
I wouldn't give you
the ice off my eyebrows.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.723
Let him go.

36:21.805 --> 36:24.058
If you don't release me,
he will break that man's neck.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.067
Yeah, well, I might do you
the same favor.

36:26.226 --> 36:27.819
- You won't.
- You don't know me.

36:27.977 --> 36:30.480
You think I stole eight million bucks.
That kind of guy wouldn't hesitate

36:30.647 --> 36:32.194
to kill anyone who gets in his way.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.485
- You won't kill me.
- Tell him to let Sam go.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.278
- Do it now.
- I can't.

36:36.444 --> 36:38.117
Do it! Do it!

36:38.279 --> 36:39.405
He has the money.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.698
Robert took the eight million.
He told me.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.538
- He's lying.
- Where?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.248
I'm not lying.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.209
He's full of shit!

36:46.371 --> 36:47.998
- He stole the money from Boyka.
- Boyka?

36:48.164 --> 36:51.293
I got no money.
Your guys made a mistake.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.881
They don't make mistakes.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.138
Well, look at this guy.
He's still fucking breathing.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.173
I call that a mistake.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.059
Just give it up, Robert.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.230
What the hell is he talking about?

37:04.389 --> 37:07.063
You know exactly
what they are talking about.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.738
Yeah, go ahead.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.420
I ought to fucking strangle you.

37:44.429 --> 37:47.182
Look, I'm not gonna last
much longer.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.060
Just tell them
you have it.

37:50.226 --> 37:52.103
Tell them you'll get it for them
and we'll get out of here.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.114
Oh, really? And what happens
when I don't have it?

37:55.273 --> 37:58.493
They'll shoot us
in a nice warm gravel pit.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.904
Oh, so that's your plan?

38:01.070 --> 38:03.539
You should be thanking me.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.371
I might have just saved your life.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.035
What, for, like,
five minutes?

38:07.202 --> 38:09.671
Now they'll never believe
I don't have the money.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.423
After what you did,
these assholes

38:12.582 --> 38:14.550
or their friends
or their friends' friends

38:14.709 --> 38:17.212
will hunt me
for the rest of my life.

38:24.260 --> 38:26.137
You have kids?

38:26.304 --> 38:27.806
No.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.977
I got two.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.318
Paulie and Kat.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.867
Paulie won't talk to me anymore
since the divorce.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.286
Boys are like that--

38:46.449 --> 38:47.826
the good ones.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.415
They look after their moms.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.254
Kat and I get on all right.

39:02.715 --> 39:05.434
She's gonna miss
her daddy.

39:12.892 --> 39:14.894
Switch clothes with me.

39:21.234 --> 39:23.111
- What?
- Come on.

39:23.278 --> 39:25.576
Come on, we're gonna
get you out of here.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.292
And what, leave you?
Come on.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.670
Yes, and leave me.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.332
You stand me up in the back
over here and hide by the door.

39:35.498 --> 39:38.001
Next time those sons of bitches
come in, you run.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.044
Run like hell and get help.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.180
It's now or never, Robert.

39:46.342 --> 39:49.016
You don't get out of here--
my kids will never know

39:49.178 --> 39:51.351
I sat here
thinking about them.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.892
There'll be no story,

39:54.058 --> 39:55.935
no body--

39:56.102 --> 39:59.356
"nichto."
You understand?

40:01.399 --> 40:02.992
If I leave you...

40:03.151 --> 40:05.654
I know.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.826
I know.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.745
Come on.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.253
You're not
handsome like me,

40:18.416 --> 40:20.760
but let's pray this works.

40:21.753 --> 40:25.508
- I owe you, man.
- No. No, you don't.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.727
I think I'm the reason
you're in here.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.014
No, it's nobody's fault.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.024
- It's just bad karma.
- I don't think so.

40:35.183 --> 40:37.436
My ex took everything.

40:37.602 --> 40:40.481
I owe money, lots of it.

40:40.647 --> 40:43.992
The vig on my marker
is more than I make in two years.

40:44.150 --> 40:47.029
IA, IRS--

40:47.195 --> 40:49.243
they all want a piece of me.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.998
You took the money?

40:51.157 --> 40:53.251
No, but I was gonna try.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.709
They don't need it like I do.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.748
I was-- I was gonna
share with--

40:58.915 --> 41:00.792
With whom? Alisa?

41:00.959 --> 41:03.633
- No, not Alisa.
- Give me the name. The name!

41:07.882 --> 41:10.305
Robert, it's time.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.289
All right, all right, all right!
You win. I'll give you the money.

41:35.451 --> 41:38.330
- Where is it?
- I have to take you there.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.715
- He's gonna chop his head off.
- I need to be there.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.342
- Why?
- Lock, dogs, booby traps--

41:43.501 --> 41:46.129
I gotta take care of it.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.718
I took the money, not him!
Cut my fucking arm off!

41:48.881 --> 41:50.554
- Where is it?
- Please don't do this.

41:50.717 --> 41:53.345
- Where is the fucking money?
- Cafe Volga!

41:57.223 --> 42:00.773
I ran into the bathroom
and hid the money in the ceiling.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.358
That's where it is.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.398
And I wasn't on a date.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.442
I knew Stepan saw me
in the parking garage.

42:07.608 --> 42:12.034
I ran into the cafe to hide out,
but they got me anyway.

42:21.748 --> 42:23.546
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
What the fuck are you doing?

42:23.708 --> 42:26.382
- Yeah?
- You can't kill a cop.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.220
He's a cop. Ask him.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.487
Huh?

42:45.855 --> 42:47.732
Detective Sam Gurov,

42:47.899 --> 42:50.527
NYPD Narcotics.

42:53.488 --> 42:55.490
You can't kill a cop.

42:55.656 --> 42:57.658
Please.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.595
Okay?

43:13.758 --> 43:15.931
No. No, no.

43:18.638 --> 43:20.766
Stepan, please listen to me.

43:20.932 --> 43:24.903
Listen to me.
This is a police officer.

43:25.061 --> 43:27.655
You can't kill a cop.

43:27.814 --> 43:29.942
You'll go to jail
for the rest of your life.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.202
Don't be a fool.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.535
He, you.

43:39.826 --> 43:42.045
Understand?

43:43.287 --> 43:46.632
He-- you.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.174
I hope hell is warm.

44:52.315 --> 44:55.535
Hitting a woman is not so different
from hitting a man.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.536
It is for me.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.665
- You killed a cop.
- He was dirty.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.368
You're animals.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.458
Even you, princess.

45:06.621 --> 45:10.000
I do what I have to
to survive, as will you.

45:10.166 --> 45:12.589
No. I wouldn't fuck
the boss's son

45:12.752 --> 45:14.754
no matter how many times
he hit me.

45:14.921 --> 45:18.676
Argh!
You fight like shit.

45:18.841 --> 45:21.264
Didn't they teach you anything
in mob school?

45:24.472 --> 45:27.772
Eight million dollars, Robert.

45:27.934 --> 45:31.814
All right, all right.
Enough of this.

45:31.979 --> 45:36.576
I got a little gambling problem.
I spent it in Vegas.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.447
Ugh!

45:41.614 --> 45:44.242
I donated it all
to my favorite charity.

45:46.869 --> 45:50.248
They're gonna build a fucking
orphanage in my name.

46:13.229 --> 46:14.776
Strip.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.317
You first.

46:17.483 --> 46:19.781
Start with the shirt.

46:19.944 --> 46:22.322
You know,
today is my birthday.

46:22.488 --> 46:24.707
Shouldn't you be the one
putting on the show?

46:27.159 --> 46:28.661
You're not gonna kill me.

46:28.828 --> 46:30.501
No.

46:30.663 --> 46:33.007
But I will put a bullet
in your kneecap...

46:33.165 --> 46:35.338
or somewhere else.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.222
Slow.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.446
Like that?

47:27.219 --> 47:28.562
Now your pants.

47:28.721 --> 47:31.645
Aw, babushka, we're moving
kind of fast, aren't we?

47:54.330 --> 47:56.424
Oh, no, no, not the--

47:56.582 --> 47:58.710
it's my life's savings.

48:00.544 --> 48:02.546
Be nice to it.

48:03.589 --> 48:05.432
That will do...

48:05.591 --> 48:07.434
for now.

48:20.022 --> 48:22.445
It's kind of a weird time
to be romantic, don't you think?

48:25.653 --> 48:29.157
It's-- oh, okay.

48:30.199 --> 48:32.452
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

48:32.618 --> 48:34.962
Ow! Oh.

48:37.456 --> 48:38.878
I like you.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.794
You've got a funny way
of showing it.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.593
I don't want to hurt you
anymore.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.303
Oh, good.

48:48.342 --> 48:51.266
Oh. Oh, your hands.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.602
Your hands-- your hands
are really, really warm.

48:53.764 --> 48:56.358
I didn't find the money
at the restaurant.

48:56.517 --> 48:58.519
Oops.

49:01.981 --> 49:05.326
You can go.
You'll be free.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.486
Oh, that'd be amazing.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.655
Yeah.

49:09.822 --> 49:11.324
Well?

49:11.490 --> 49:14.664
- No.
- Then you die.

49:14.827 --> 49:17.125
And you'll never get
the money.

49:18.122 --> 49:20.375
Oh-hh!

49:22.168 --> 49:24.011
Oh.

49:24.170 --> 49:26.343
I think
I'll liked the bite better.

49:26.505 --> 49:29.054
Yeah. No, I did.
I definitely--

49:29.216 --> 49:31.093
oh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait.

49:31.260 --> 49:33.308
Before you go,

49:33.471 --> 49:36.975
there's something
you need to know.

49:37.141 --> 49:40.862
I'm not the only one
holding the cards here.

49:42.021 --> 49:44.194
Isn't it odd

49:44.356 --> 49:46.233
that no one found
Sam's phone?

49:46.400 --> 49:48.823
That Sam was still alive in here

49:48.986 --> 49:50.863
when everyone else
thought he was dead?

49:51.030 --> 49:52.703
I think someone
was trying to save him.

49:52.865 --> 49:53.866
What are you saying?

49:54.033 --> 49:56.377
He told me
he had a partner.

49:56.535 --> 49:58.708
And if you don't listen,
they're gonna get the money,

49:58.871 --> 50:01.169
I promise you.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.881
Sam was a dirty cop.

50:04.043 --> 50:06.011
You said it yourself.
He owed money.

50:06.170 --> 50:08.423
And you delivered the money
to Boyka.

50:08.589 --> 50:10.387
Am I right?

50:10.549 --> 50:12.597
And Boyka
was Sam's snitch.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.762
If you didn't know that,
he was.

50:14.929 --> 50:18.058
Boyka trusted Sam--
a bad mistake.

50:18.224 --> 50:20.443
The money was stolen,

50:20.601 --> 50:22.274
Boyka is blamed,

50:22.436 --> 50:24.655
and who kills him?

50:24.813 --> 50:26.235
Stepan.

50:26.398 --> 50:29.868
And who saw me
in the parking garage?

50:30.027 --> 50:31.950
Think about it.

50:32.112 --> 50:33.830
Stepan.

50:42.998 --> 50:45.217
I trust Stepan.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.380
Why would he kill the cop
if they are working together?

50:49.547 --> 50:52.426
Sam would have spilled the beans
to save his own life.

50:52.591 --> 50:54.969
If Stepan hadn't
chopped his head off...

51:11.443 --> 51:12.911
What--

51:13.070 --> 51:14.447
What's your beef, man?

51:37.219 --> 51:40.348
- Nyet!
- Oh, shit.

51:55.321 --> 51:57.665
Tell him what I said.

51:57.823 --> 52:00.702
- Tell him!
- No.

52:09.668 --> 52:11.295
That's right.
He understands.

52:11.462 --> 52:14.636
Right?
You understand, right?

52:14.798 --> 52:16.800
You got your fucking money.

52:16.967 --> 52:19.140
Enough of this bullshit.

52:19.303 --> 52:21.601
You don't need me.
Run while you can.

52:23.182 --> 52:26.812
Hmm? Huh?

52:28.854 --> 52:30.697
What are you waiting for?

52:30.856 --> 52:33.530
Huh? Pull the trigger.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.320
Pull it.

52:38.197 --> 52:39.244
Do it!

52:39.406 --> 52:41.534
That's the only way to keep me
from killing you.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.754
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

52:50.042 --> 52:53.046
Yeah? Whatever.

53:36.004 --> 53:37.347
Oh-hh.

53:49.226 --> 53:51.900
Did the bad man hurt you?

54:29.475 --> 54:31.477
Oh...

54:33.479 --> 54:36.153
Happy birthday, dumb-ass.

54:36.315 --> 54:38.818
Oh, that's nice.
That's nice.

55:05.677 --> 55:08.055
Did you bring
the marshmallows?

55:10.516 --> 55:12.689
It's out of fuel anyway, Borat.

55:14.686 --> 55:16.029
This is goodbye.

55:16.188 --> 55:18.190
I'm sad.

55:19.191 --> 55:21.660
Don't trust him.

55:21.819 --> 55:23.321
You know, a different place,
a different time,

55:23.487 --> 55:26.206
you and me-- I think
we could have worked out.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.538
A little apartment
in the East Village,

55:28.700 --> 55:32.546
sipping vodka, making love,
watching "Doctor Zhivago."

55:33.539 --> 55:35.541
I can't save you, Robert.

55:36.542 --> 55:38.715
Aggh!
What the fuck--?

55:40.045 --> 55:42.423
- The money.
- Ask him. He's got the money.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.762
Huh? Huh?

55:44.925 --> 55:47.553
Save me, Robert.
Please save me.

55:47.719 --> 55:49.392
I'm not falling for this bullshit.

55:49.555 --> 55:52.024
It's not a trick.
It's not a trick.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.905
Uh, uh...

55:58.063 --> 56:00.441
All right. All right.

56:00.607 --> 56:02.200
All right.

56:02.359 --> 56:05.579
I'll get you the money.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone!

56:05.737 --> 56:07.614
Telephone.

56:14.246 --> 56:15.748
The cop stole the money.

56:15.914 --> 56:18.713
He had a partner,
but it wasn't you, dickhead.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.504
His name is
Detective Al Dorian.

56:22.629 --> 56:25.257
That's the cop I was talking to
on the phone.

56:25.424 --> 56:27.392
That's why he was trying
to call Sam--

56:27.551 --> 56:29.895
to find out where he stashed
the money.

56:30.053 --> 56:31.475
If you let me call,
I'll make him believe

56:31.638 --> 56:34.312
that giving the money back
is the only way to save Sam's life.

56:34.474 --> 56:37.819
- What about Sam?
- Uh, I'll tell him that he's--

56:37.978 --> 56:39.525
that he's unconscious
or he's tied up.

56:39.688 --> 56:41.782
I'll tell him whatever the fuck
I have to, to get the eight mil.

56:41.940 --> 56:44.113
- Then I'll call him.
- No. He'll never believe you.

56:44.276 --> 56:46.779
But he might buy my story.

56:46.945 --> 56:50.449
It's worth a shot.
Just give me the phone.

56:50.616 --> 56:52.618
Huh?

56:52.784 --> 56:54.252
Give me the phone.

56:55.454 --> 56:58.003
Huh? Okay.

57:05.631 --> 57:09.261
- What's your emergency?
- Detective Al Dorian, NYPD Narcotics.

57:09.426 --> 57:11.645
It's Robert Saunders.
It's an emergency.

57:11.803 --> 57:13.976
I'll connect you now.

57:19.019 --> 57:20.817
God damn,
you're still alive?

57:20.979 --> 57:22.697
Barely.
They gave me a phone

57:22.856 --> 57:25.154
so I could call
and get the money.

57:25.317 --> 57:26.819
- Are they with you now?
- Yes.

57:26.985 --> 57:30.239
They want the money now
or they're gonna kill Sam and me.

57:30.405 --> 57:31.782
Is Sam there?

57:31.949 --> 57:34.168
- Can you get it?
- Where are you?

57:36.703 --> 57:38.705
What are you doing?
I had the money.

57:38.872 --> 57:41.341
He was ready to bring it, but you
have to tell me where we are.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.173
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

57:46.088 --> 57:48.011
Let me call him back.
Let me call him back.

57:49.007 --> 57:50.224
Nyet!

57:55.806 --> 57:57.808
Oh...

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.090
No Russian, please.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.342
I'm so sick of it.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:19.885
You a fucking cop?

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.684
No cop.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.724
A mechanic.

01:01:25.891 --> 01:01:28.144
Really? A mechanic?

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:32.197
You're a bad liar.

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:35.234
Truth is,
I'm a very good liar.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.864
I don't think so.
Look at yourself.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.077
What kind of car do you drive?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:48.247
What kind of car I drive?

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:54.428
BMW, M5.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.475
Is it carbon-chipped?

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.812
For performance.

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:11.945
Does it jump through a red
light on a mis-shift?

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.856
My friend says
it's nothing to worry.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:19.452
Friend sell you the car?

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.579
You are a good liar.

01:02:26.534 --> 01:02:27.660
Danil.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.795
My name is known to many,

01:02:29.955 --> 01:02:32.458
but not my story,

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:34.797
and never my face.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.421
Robert.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.476
You took the shot at Oleg.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:46.605
What did you hear, Robert?

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.599
That you missed.

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:55.155
Humph.
Three months on Internet

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:58.613
to get Oleg out of house
with only four bodyguards.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.205
I pretend to be young girl.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:06.162
Rendezvous set,
and Oleg switched location.

01:03:06.324 --> 01:03:07.997
Then last minute, switch again.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:10.036
Finally Oleg arrives

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.297
holding a little puppy.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.383
Too many ways to escape.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:18.716
Shocking how fast
the old rabbit ran.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:21.506
All those years
in a track suit, I suppose.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.305
Who hired you?

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:29.307
Well, it might help to know
who wants Oleg dead.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.906
Do you see a way
out of here, Robert?

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:39.862
Do you?

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:44.371
Only one, Robert--

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:46.202
You.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.042
I will be killed
when Oleg arrives,

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.374
but you're different.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.631
There's a reason you're still alive.

01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:59.419
I know how to get out of here,

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.556
but I'm just--
just too damn cold.

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:05.467
Mm.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.556
50/50.

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:11.940
What?

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:18.897
70/30.

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:31.960
60/40.
That's it.

01:04:34.662 --> 01:04:36.539
How much is your life worth?

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:39.425
In here-- nothing.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.723
50/50.

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:50.266
40/60.

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:53.606
You're too cold, remember?

01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.101
Partners?

01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:03.108
Take a look.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.658
I broke that vent

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:09.664
to climb out of here.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.700
There's a small duct,

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:14.585
probably leads to those fans
above the door.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:17.247
What I did find was wires--

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.712
110 for the fans
and 220 for the condenser.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:22.002
They run parallel in there.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:23.340
Meaning?

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.551
Meaning <i>we</i> need you
to climb this shelf

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:27.556
and play electrician.

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.010
Why don't you do it?

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:33.396
My fingers
are frozen to the bone.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.228
I can't even feel them.

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:38.351
What are you trying to do?

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:41.146
The lights will blow
when the freezer door opens

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:43.440
and you'll be up front

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:47.201
and attack in the dark...
with this.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:59.293
Unless you'd rather
cut my throat.

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.670
I guess we're gonna
find out, huh?

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.678
It's what you do, isn't it--

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:12.185
move fast with a box cutter,

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:14.016
cut us out of here?

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.602
And on to the money.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:22.528
See it?

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.689
I see a conduit box.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.199
The lid is off.

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:29.406
Yeah, I tried to do it myself,
but I just couldn't.

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:30.946
I see wires.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.830
What color?

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:40.414
Black, white
and candy cane.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:44.210
All right, pull the black
and the candy cane ones out.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:46.503
They're the ones
that power this freezer.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.671
Should be some slack
up there.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:55.562
All right.
Now cut the wires

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.098
and pull the insulation off
about six inches.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:07.524
You think I'm an idiot?

01:07:09.067 --> 01:07:10.910
You cut it.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:15.248
I told you my fingers are--

01:07:46.104 --> 01:07:49.358
Do you worry that after we escape,
I will kill you and take all the money?

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.616
I know you'll try, Danil,

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:56.122
but like any good thief,

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.283
I plan to steal your share

01:07:58.449 --> 01:08:02.079
and be long gone
to the south of France by then.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:08.468
Shit.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:12.301
Push these back up there
and then close the vent.

01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.269
Vadim!

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.063
Vadim?!

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:43.832
Do you know who you just killed?

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:46.464
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Do you have any idea?

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.796
- Danil?
- That's not Danil.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:51.551
That's Vadim--
Oleg's son!

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.761
Nyet!

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:02.850
Yes, you heard her-- nyet.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.649
Argh!

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:20.698
Sorry.

01:10:18.923 --> 01:10:21.767
I heard you were
man of honor and integrity,

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:22.927
but that is lie.

01:10:23.094 --> 01:10:25.688
You can't kill me,
so you kill my son.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:27.019
Why?

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.443
I brought you here
for a reason.

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:35.698
Oh, so you brought me here?
This was your plan.

01:10:35.857 --> 01:10:37.700
Some plan.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:42.413
Who put you on me?

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:44.495
Who hired you?

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:46.659
Was it Arshin?

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:50.296
Trokmykov?
Who paid you?

01:10:50.455 --> 01:10:53.379
Speak, you fucking whore.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.472
No.

01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:09.315
Let me do this

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.772
the old-fashioned way.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.107
I have news for you.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:17.023
You are going
to a very warm place.

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:20.451
It is honor

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.908
to kill you myself.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:37.301
Confess!

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.981
Argh.

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:05.196
Kill this dog.

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:23.339
Argh!

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.510
When the devil asks
what brought you,

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.429
tell him it was freedom--

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:31.472
I killed you for freedom.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:34.108
Freedom?
I don't own you.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:36.065
I don't even know you.

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:38.571
Not for me. For her.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.831
What took you so long?

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:08.384
Danya.

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.097
I was so scared.

01:13:13.264 --> 01:13:16.188
So many times I wanted to cry

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:19.399
or to say, "Stop. Stop."

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:21.940
No, no, no.

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:24.404
No, don't cry.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.990
Your tears will freeze.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:33.534
Nyet!

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.810
I can't think anymore.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:56.690
Oh, my God, they will kill us.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.772
They will kill us.

01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:09.533
You've been here too long, baby.
You are nearly frozen.

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:28.801
Tell me.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.137
What?

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:33.728
Tell me again.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.809
In the south of France...

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.522
in Montpellier,

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.564
the historic center of town
is called l'Ecusson.

01:14:45.898 --> 01:14:47.696
It's full of small squares

01:14:47.858 --> 01:14:52.159
with beautiful shops,
wonderful bars and cafes,

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.948
art galleries

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:56.413
which you would
suffer through for me.

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:57.952
Danyam?

01:14:58.119 --> 01:15:00.542
I'm listening.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.220
On top, there is
a small restaurant.

01:15:12.383 --> 01:15:16.388
They have the most incredible
bread and cheese

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:19.273
that melts in your mouth
like butter.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.648
If you look out of the window,

01:15:23.811 --> 01:15:26.064
if you squint,

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.904
you will see
the Mediterranean Sea.

01:15:29.066 --> 01:15:30.739
NYPD!

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:32.778
Put your hands
where I can see them.

01:15:33.904 --> 01:15:36.032
Dorian?

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.412
It's me-- Robert.

01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:42.125
I know who you are.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.507
Are you armed?

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.672
One on your wrist,
one on his,

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:50.258
one in the middle,
around that post. Do it now.

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:52.264
He is shot.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.848
He will die
if we don't get out of here.

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.980
The zips, now.
Do it now.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:13.619
You killed Oleg.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:15.655
Who's that?

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:17.949
Vadim-- his son.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.415
Tighter.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.304
Who the hell is she?

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.310
Nobody.

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.688
Just one of their girls.

01:16:43.641 --> 01:16:45.143
Did you find the money?

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.812
No.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:49.821
I'm not sure I believe you.

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.945
I'm the only one
who knows where you are.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:57.660
And I'm not leaving
without that money.

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:01.458
Now you can
walk out that door

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.494
or I can close it and leave--
up to you.

01:17:03.661 --> 01:17:06.756
I've been hearing that
a lot lately.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.214
Fine.

01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:14.051
No. No.

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:15.681
I'll tell you.

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:19.435
"Just one of their girls," huh?

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:25.016
You bullshit me, I will leave.

01:17:30.771 --> 01:17:32.694
New York cuts.

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:34.859
New York cuts...?

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:57.219
The money's been here the entire time?

01:17:57.381 --> 01:17:59.258
Fuck.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.302
Let me out of here!

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:03.345
Let me out!

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.731
Saunders,
Let me out of here!

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:50.397
You can kiss our
eight million bucks goodbye.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:53.062
I don't care about the money.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:59.402
Are you sure you still love me?

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.616
Yeah.

01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:05.407
Let me out!

01:19:09.119 --> 01:19:11.121
I have something for you.

01:19:12.998 --> 01:19:14.875
A gift from Oleg.

01:19:23.634 --> 01:19:25.636
Happy birthday.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.816
Hey!

01:19:30.975 --> 01:19:34.149
Keep it fucking moving, huh?
Get a room already!

01:19:42.903 --> 01:19:45.247
Sorry.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.877
Now how about
that nice cup of hot cocoa?

01:19:50.305 --> 01:19:56.506
