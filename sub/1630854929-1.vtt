03:07.771 --> 03:10.148
Today, we're looking
at some of the hottest weather…

05:04.888 --> 05:06.056
Hey.

05:10.686 --> 05:11.687
What is it?

05:14.106 --> 05:15.399
What?

05:15.482 --> 05:18.694
We've been ordered to stand down.
They're scrapping the program.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.947
They say we fell short.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.241
The contract threshold is Mach 10.

05:24.324 --> 05:28.453
Mach 10 is supposed to be in two months.
Today's test point is Mach 9.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.372
Well, that's not good enough.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.832
Says who?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.458
Admiral Cain.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.211
The Drone Ranger.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.797
He wants our budget
for his unmanned program.

05:38.881 --> 05:42.384
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.691
Well, he isn't here yet.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.280
They want Mach 10,

06:03.989 --> 06:05.199
let's give 'em Mach 10.

06:23.217 --> 06:26.136
Now remember,
the contract threshold is Mach 10.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.723
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.808
That should keep the program alive.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.271
I don't like that look, Mav.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.816
It's the only one I got.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.370
Control, this is Darkstar.
How do you read?

06:51.453 --> 06:53.830
Darkstar, Control. Loud and clear. How me?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.874
Loud and clear.
Takeoff precheck's complete.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.167
Ready for APU start.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.920
Ready left engine start.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.131
Ready right engine start.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.342
Thumbs for taxi.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.513
We are ready for taxi.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.518
Tower, this is Darkstar.
We are taxiing with information Alpha.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.520
Darkstar, you are clear to taxi.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.523
Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.109
-Fuel temps are looking good.
-Control concurs.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.862
Battery's holding at 95%.
Cabin pressure looks good.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.154
Control concurs.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.865
Tower, this is Darkstar.
We're ready for takeoff.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.909
Requesting an unrestricted climb
to 600 and above.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.412
Darkstar, the runway and skies are yours.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.539
Rear Admiral Chester Cain.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.876
Maverick, Cain just pulled up to the gate.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.044
It's not too late to stop, buddy.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.756
You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.386
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.640
Darkstar is ready for takeoff.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.769
Everyone,

07:58.270 --> 08:00.522
go for takeoff, starting with engine.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.399
-Engine, go.
-Thermals, go.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.568
-Fuel, go.
-Electric, go.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.986
Control surfaces, go.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.780
Darkstar, Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.407
All right, sweetheart,

08:11.074 --> 08:12.242
one last ride.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.980
Darkstar, you are cleared above 600.
Increase to Mach 3.5.

08:42.063 --> 08:45.901
Cleared above 600. Increase to Mach 3.5.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.283
Admiral.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.620
-Just in time, sir.
-I'm early. So are you.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.163
You care to explain?

08:58.247 --> 09:00.207
Transitioning to scramjet.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.014
Mav, Admiral Cain is asking--

09:16.098 --> 09:18.559
-Ordering.
-Ordering that we bring her down.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.609
…within six…

09:27.693 --> 09:29.444
This is where we've had trouble
with comms, sir.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.905
It's the Earth's curvature.
It's called "Earth Bulge."

09:31.989 --> 09:33.323
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

09:35.075 --> 09:35.909
Okay.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.752
He's at Mach 7, pushing 8.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.046
-Flight data?
-Receiving. Data is good.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.804
Temperature's climbing.
Response is still stable.

09:55.888 --> 09:56.722
We're feeling good.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.727
Mach 8.8.

10:02.728 --> 10:03.729
8.9.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.647
Mach 9.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.441
He's the fastest man alive.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.337
Talk to me, Goose.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.465
Mach 9.1.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.467
9.2.

10:40.766 --> 10:41.975
Mach 9.3.

10:44.686 --> 10:45.896
9.4.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.358
Approaching high hypersonic.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.288
Windshield hot caution.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.049
Surface temp rising.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.390
Come on, sweetheart, just a little more.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.267
Just a little.

11:27.062 --> 11:27.938
Come on!

11:34.570 --> 11:35.404
Come on!

11:40.909 --> 11:41.910
Mach 10!

11:44.580 --> 11:46.415
Put that in your Pentagon budget!

11:48.333 --> 11:49.543
Sir.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.347
Don't do it. Don't do it.

12:02.431 --> 12:03.432
Just…

12:05.350 --> 12:07.519
a little push.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.400
Holy shit.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.913
You got some balls, stick jockey.

12:25.996 --> 12:27.414
I'll give you that.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.836
Oh, shit.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.134
Maverick.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.471
Maverick!

13:32.729 --> 13:33.814
Thank you.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.816
Where am I?

13:37.276 --> 13:38.485
Earth.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.418
Maverick.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.837
Thirty-plus years of service.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.423
Combat medals.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.841
Citations.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.929
Only man to shoot down three enemy planes
in the last 40 years.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.973
"Distinguished."

14:08.056 --> 14:11.643
"Distinguished." "Distinguished."

14:13.395 --> 14:16.690
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

14:16.773 --> 14:19.818
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

14:20.402 --> 14:24.448
You should be at least a two-star admiral
by now, if not a senator.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.617
Yet here you are:

14:28.285 --> 14:29.369
Captain.

14:30.454 --> 14:31.788
Why is that?

14:32.581 --> 14:34.208
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.

14:34.291 --> 14:37.794
This isn't a joke. I asked you a question.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.465
I'm where I belong, sir.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.676
Well, the navy doesn't see it that way.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.803
Not anymore.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.015
These planes you've been testing,

14:50.724 --> 14:51.808
Captain,

14:52.351 --> 14:55.354
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.441
Pilots that need to sleep, eat,
take a piss.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.820
Pilots that disobey orders.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.200
All you did was buy some time
for those men out there.

15:10.285 --> 15:11.537
The future is coming,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.414
and you're not in it.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.418
Escort this man off the base.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.924
Take him to his quarters.
Wait with him while he packs his gear.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.388
I want him on the road to North Island
within the hour.

15:32.641 --> 15:34.184
North Island, sir?

15:35.143 --> 15:37.604
Call came in with impeccable timing,

15:37.688 --> 15:41.358
right as I was driving here
to ground your ass once and for all.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.362
It galls me to say it, but…

15:46.780 --> 15:50.534
for reasons known only to the Almighty
and your guardian angel…

15:52.536 --> 15:54.955
you've been called back to TOPGUN.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.546
-Sir?
-You are dismissed, Captain.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.720
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.556
Your kind is headed for extinction.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.853
Maybe so, sir.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.981
But not today.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.757
Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.426
Your reputation precedes you.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.762
Thank you, sir.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.557
Wasn't a compliment.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.351
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.603
I'm the Air Boss.
I believe you know Admiral Bates.

17:42.354 --> 17:43.313
Warlock, sir.

17:43.355 --> 17:46.108
Must admit,
I wasn't expecting an invitation back.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.985
They're called orders, Maverick.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.863
You two have something in common.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.740
Cyclone here was first in his class
back in '88.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.784
Actually, sir, I finished second.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.453
Just want to manage expectations.

18:02.666 --> 18:03.917
The target…

18:06.044 --> 18:08.755
is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

18:08.839 --> 18:11.300
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

18:11.383 --> 18:14.344
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

18:14.428 --> 18:15.721
to our allies in the region.

18:15.804 --> 18:20.058
The Pentagon has tasked us with assembling
a strike team and taking it out

18:20.142 --> 18:21.852
before it becomes fully operational.

18:22.895 --> 18:26.732
The plant sits in an underground bunker
at the end of this valley.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.525
Said valley is GPS-jammed

18:28.609 --> 18:31.403
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

18:31.486 --> 18:34.156
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

18:34.239 --> 18:38.202
which in turn are backed up by
a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.579
Even a few old F-14s.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.956
Seems like we're not the only ones
holding on to old relics.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.251
What's your read, Captain?

18:48.420 --> 18:52.216
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth,

18:52.299 --> 18:55.010
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

18:55.093 --> 18:58.847
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

18:58.931 --> 19:00.349
tailor-made for the F-18.

19:00.432 --> 19:01.433
I figure,

19:02.100 --> 19:04.102
two precision bombs, minimum.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.647
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.399
That is one hell of a steep climb
out of there,

19:09.483 --> 19:11.818
exposing you
to all the surface-to-air missiles.

19:12.528 --> 19:13.779
You survive that,

19:15.030 --> 19:16.657
it's a dogfight all the way home.

19:16.740 --> 19:19.368
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.204
Not in the same mission, sir.

19:24.957 --> 19:25.958
No.

19:28.794 --> 19:31.255
No, someone's not coming back from this.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.798
Can it be done or not?

19:33.465 --> 19:35.300
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

19:35.384 --> 19:37.177
Three weeks. Maybe less.

19:38.554 --> 19:41.181
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an F-18, and…

19:42.182 --> 19:44.643
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.854
But I'll find a way to make it work.

19:46.937 --> 19:48.605
I think you misunderstand, Captain.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.148
Sir?

19:50.232 --> 19:53.485
We don't want you to fly it.
We want you to teach it.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.698
Teach, sir?

19:59.241 --> 20:02.744
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN graduates
from their squadrons.

20:02.828 --> 20:05.539
We want you to narrow that pool
down to six.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.791
They'll fly the mission.

20:09.501 --> 20:10.919
Is there a problem, Captain?

20:12.838 --> 20:15.132
You know there is, sir.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.176
Yeah.

20:17.843 --> 20:20.345
Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster."

20:20.429 --> 20:22.264
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.141
What was his call sign?

20:24.892 --> 20:26.518
"Goose," sir.

20:26.602 --> 20:27.936
Tragic what happened.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.938
Captain Mitchell was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

20:30.022 --> 20:31.857
Goose's death was an accident.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.567
Is that how you see it, Captain?

20:33.650 --> 20:35.736
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

20:38.780 --> 20:41.742
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.493
You were a TOPGUN instructor before.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.996
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

20:46.079 --> 20:47.331
It's not where I belong.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.583
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.920
You were not my first choice.
In fact, you weren't even on the list.

20:53.712 --> 20:56.256
You are here at the request
of Admiral Kazansky.

20:56.965 --> 21:00.636
Now, Iceman happens to be a man
I deeply admire,

21:00.719 --> 21:03.722
and he seems to think that you have
something left to offer the navy.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.642
What that is, I can't imagine.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.978
You don't have to take this job.

21:10.062 --> 21:11.313
But let me be clear:

21:11.396 --> 21:14.316
This will be your last post, Captain.

21:16.068 --> 21:19.530
You fly for TOPGUN,
or you don't fly for the navy ever again.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.915
Twenty bucks you can't get three in a row.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.542
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

22:16.128 --> 22:17.212
Pete.

22:18.589 --> 22:19.715
Penny?

22:20.674 --> 22:24.094
-What are you doing here?
-I should ask you the same thing.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.556
-Well, that is a long story.
-I doubt that.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.473
Yeah.

22:28.557 --> 22:30.350
Who'd you piss off this time?

22:30.434 --> 22:31.852
Another admiral.

22:31.935 --> 22:32.936
Exactly.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.816
-Are you mad at me?
-Oh, Pete.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.945
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.698
I got to say,

22:44.781 --> 22:48.327
North Island is the one place
I thought for sure I'd never run into you.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.788
-How long you been here?
-Bought this place about three years ago.

22:51.872 --> 22:53.707
-Three years?
-Yeah.

22:53.790 --> 22:58.295
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

22:59.213 --> 23:01.340
That was three years ago?

23:02.466 --> 23:04.635
You must be in a lot of trouble.

23:05.219 --> 23:07.304
No way you'd come back here willingly.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.140
Well,

23:10.974 --> 23:12.559
you'll sort it out.

23:13.227 --> 23:14.436
No, I think…

23:15.812 --> 23:18.315
-I think this is it.
-Come on, Pete.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.151
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

23:21.235 --> 23:24.863
You said it after they busted you for
taking me on a joyride in that F-18.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.866
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

23:28.492 --> 23:31.078
Then Iraq. Both times.

23:31.161 --> 23:32.788
You get yourself in trouble,

23:33.914 --> 23:36.792
Iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.418
Penny, this is different.

23:38.502 --> 23:40.003
Pete, trust me,

23:40.087 --> 23:42.339
as improbable as it seems right now,

23:42.422 --> 23:45.759
somehow you'll be back in a fighter plane
with your tail on fire.

23:46.927 --> 23:48.929
-Penny…
-Too late.

23:49.012 --> 23:49.847
What?

23:49.930 --> 23:52.099
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

23:55.686 --> 23:57.354
Don't give me that look.

23:58.522 --> 24:00.983
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

24:01.692 --> 24:04.194
It always ends the same with us, Pete.

24:05.696 --> 24:07.531
Let's not start this time.

24:11.952 --> 24:12.786
Okay.

24:13.704 --> 24:14.705
Okay.

24:19.543 --> 24:20.878
You look good.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.639
Much appreciated, pal.

24:35.392 --> 24:36.476
What am I missing?

24:38.896 --> 24:42.816
"Disrespect a lady, the navy,
or put your cell phone on my bar…"

24:42.900 --> 24:44.776
"…and you buy a round."

24:45.360 --> 24:46.486
For everyone?

24:46.570 --> 24:49.323
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.159
Oh, come on!

24:52.743 --> 24:54.703
What do we have here?

24:56.413 --> 24:58.665
If it ain't Phoenix!

24:58.749 --> 25:01.168
And here I thought we were special,
Coyote.

25:02.586 --> 25:05.464
Turns out the invite went to anyone.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.883
Fellas, this here's Bagman.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.718
-Hangman.
-Whatever.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.513
You're looking at the only naval aviator
on active duty

25:12.596 --> 25:14.097
with a confirmed air-to-air kill.

25:14.181 --> 25:15.015
Stop.

25:15.098 --> 25:19.102
Mind you, the other guy was in
a museum piece from the Korean War.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.939
-Cold War.
-Different wars, same century.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.023
Not this one.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.483
Who are your friends?

25:24.566 --> 25:26.568
-Payback.
-Fanboy.

25:26.652 --> 25:28.654
-Hey, Coyote.
-Hey.

25:28.737 --> 25:30.280
-Who's he?
-Who's who?

25:33.367 --> 25:34.660
When did you get in?

25:35.285 --> 25:37.371
I've been here the whole time.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.082
-The man's a stealth pilot.
-Literally.

25:40.165 --> 25:42.543
Weapons systems officer, actually.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.628
With no sense of humor.

25:46.588 --> 25:47.756
What do they call you?

25:48.465 --> 25:49.800
Bob.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.134
No, your call sign.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.055
Bob.

25:55.556 --> 25:56.473
Bob Floyd.

25:57.349 --> 26:00.185
You're my new backseater? From Lemoore?

26:01.353 --> 26:03.063
Looks like it. Yeah.

26:06.650 --> 26:07.985
Nine-ball, Bob.

26:08.735 --> 26:09.570
Rack 'em.

26:11.572 --> 26:12.823
Okay.

26:13.490 --> 26:15.492
-Penny, my dear.
-Yeah.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.744
I'll have four more on the old-timer.

26:34.595 --> 26:36.096
Bradshaw!

26:36.847 --> 26:38.348
Is that you?

26:43.979 --> 26:46.064
This is how I find out you're stateside?

26:46.190 --> 26:48.066
Yeah, I just thought I'd surprise you.

26:50.861 --> 26:52.988
I guess I surprised you back.

26:54.698 --> 26:56.491
-It's good to see you.
-Good to see you too.

26:59.203 --> 27:00.954
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

27:01.038 --> 27:02.748
Much appreciated, Pops.

27:10.214 --> 27:13.050
How about ringing me up
before the evening rush?

27:27.189 --> 27:28.440
Bradshaw.

27:28.524 --> 27:30.108
As I live and breathe.

27:30.943 --> 27:31.944
Hangman.

27:32.027 --> 27:34.196
You look… good.

27:35.364 --> 27:37.115
Well, I am good, Rooster.

27:38.951 --> 27:39.952
I'm very good.

27:40.536 --> 27:42.079
In fact,

27:42.162 --> 27:43.956
I am too good to be true.

27:44.039 --> 27:45.290
So,

27:45.374 --> 27:47.918
anybody know what this special
detachment is all about?

27:48.001 --> 27:51.046
No, mission's a mission.
They don't confront me.

27:51.797 --> 27:54.758
What I want to know:
Who's gonna be team leader?

27:55.467 --> 27:59.471
And which one of y'all has what it takes
to follow me?

28:00.973 --> 28:04.476
Hangman, the only place you'll lead anyone
is an early grave.

28:13.318 --> 28:17.072
Well, anyone who follows you
is just gonna run out of fuel.

28:17.906 --> 28:20.200
But that's just you, ain't it, Rooster?

28:20.993 --> 28:23.495
You're snug on that perch,

28:23.579 --> 28:25.789
waiting for just the right moment…

28:27.916 --> 28:29.251
that never comes.

28:32.671 --> 28:34.590
I love this song!

28:41.722 --> 28:43.390
Well, he hasn't changed.

28:44.433 --> 28:46.602
Nope. Sure hasn't.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.232
Check it out.

28:53.317 --> 28:54.443
More patches.

28:54.985 --> 28:58.071
That's Harvard, Yale, Omaha.
Shit, that's Fritz.

28:58.155 --> 29:00.365
What the hell kind of mission is this?

29:01.366 --> 29:03.368
That's not the question
we should be asking.

29:04.161 --> 29:06.163
Everyone here is the best there is.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.625
Who the hell are they gonna get
to teach us?

29:13.045 --> 29:14.588
It's been declined.

29:15.172 --> 29:16.006
You're kidding.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.941
Hey, guys. Come on.

29:48.038 --> 29:49.081
How about…

29:50.624 --> 29:52.376
That won't cover it.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.342
I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you the cash.

30:00.425 --> 30:03.303
I'm afraid rules are rules, Pete.

30:09.393 --> 30:12.271
Overboard! Overboard!

30:13.188 --> 30:14.439
Really?

30:15.482 --> 30:18.569
Overboard! Overboard!

30:25.784 --> 30:27.661
Great to see you, Pete!

30:28.328 --> 30:31.164
Overboard! Overboard!

30:34.793 --> 30:37.171
Thanks for the beers! Come back anytime!

30:48.807 --> 30:51.310
You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain

30:51.393 --> 30:54.271
Too much love drives a man insane

30:54.354 --> 30:57.024
You broke my will, but what a thrill

30:57.107 --> 31:00.319
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

31:00.402 --> 31:03.071
I laughed at love
'Cause I thought it was funny

31:03.155 --> 31:06.283
But you came along and you moved me, honey

31:06.366 --> 31:09.119
I changed my mind, this love is fine

31:09.203 --> 31:11.955
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

31:12.039 --> 31:14.333
Kiss me, baby

31:19.922 --> 31:22.758
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!

31:39.233 --> 31:42.319
Altitude 8,000… 7,000…

31:42.402 --> 31:44.738
Goose, I can't reach the ejection handle.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.823
Eject, eject, eject!

31:52.746 --> 31:54.248
Goose! Oh, no!

31:54.331 --> 31:57.125
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

32:41.211 --> 32:42.421
Attention on deck!

32:53.348 --> 32:54.391
Morning.

32:55.058 --> 32:57.227
Welcome to your special training
detachment.

32:57.311 --> 32:58.353
Be seated.

32:58.937 --> 33:01.607
I'm Admiral Bates, NAWDC commander.

33:01.690 --> 33:03.442
You're all TOPGUN graduates.

33:04.234 --> 33:05.527
The elite.

33:05.611 --> 33:07.613
The best of the best.

33:08.197 --> 33:10.032
That was yesterday.

33:11.074 --> 33:15.078
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter
has leveled the playing field.

33:15.162 --> 33:16.788
Details are few, but you can be sure

33:16.872 --> 33:18.916
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

33:18.999 --> 33:22.294
Success, now more than ever,

33:22.377 --> 33:25.547
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

33:26.465 --> 33:28.759
Half of you will make the cut.

33:28.842 --> 33:30.719
One of you will be named mission leader.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.972
The other half will remain in reserve.

33:34.973 --> 33:36.975
Your instructor is a TOPGUN graduate

33:37.059 --> 33:39.603
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

33:39.686 --> 33:41.271
you will be expected to master.

33:42.231 --> 33:44.441
His exploits are legendary.

33:45.901 --> 33:48.070
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

33:48.153 --> 33:50.155
this program has ever produced.

33:51.573 --> 33:53.158
What he has to teach you

33:53.242 --> 33:56.620
may very well mean the difference
between life and death.

33:57.454 --> 33:59.790
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

34:00.290 --> 34:03.085
Call sign: "Maverick."

34:07.631 --> 34:08.632
Good morning.

34:17.014 --> 34:18.684
The F-18 NATOPS.

34:20.268 --> 34:23.772
It contains everything they want you
to know about your aircraft.

34:24.773 --> 34:27.568
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

34:27.650 --> 34:28.902
-Damn right.
-Damn straight.

34:28.985 --> 34:30.152
You got it.

34:38.203 --> 34:39.705
So does your enemy.

34:40.289 --> 34:41.790
And we're off.

34:42.833 --> 34:46.043
But what the enemy doesn't know
is your limits.

34:46.837 --> 34:48.547
I intend to find them,

34:48.630 --> 34:50.257
test them,

34:50.841 --> 34:52.217
push beyond.

34:53.385 --> 34:56.972
Today we'll start
with what you only think you know.

34:58.891 --> 35:00.684
You show me what you're made of.

35:05.814 --> 35:06.815
Rooster.

35:07.983 --> 35:09.026
Bradley.

35:09.651 --> 35:11.403
Lieutenant Bradshaw!

35:13.405 --> 35:14.406
Yes, sir.

35:15.407 --> 35:17.117
Let's not do it like this.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.286
You gonna wash me out?

35:20.913 --> 35:22.623
That'll be up to you, not me.

35:24.917 --> 35:26.293
Am I dismissed?

35:43.852 --> 35:46.271
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

35:46.355 --> 35:48.482
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

35:50.025 --> 35:52.986
As briefed,
today's exercise is dogfighting.

35:53.070 --> 35:54.696
Guns only, no missiles.

35:55.697 --> 35:58.825
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

35:58.909 --> 36:01.828
Working as a team,
you have to shoot me down, or else.

36:01.912 --> 36:05.249
-Or else what, sir?
-Or else I shoot back.

36:05.332 --> 36:08.252
If I shoot either one of you down,
you both lose.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.212
This guy needs an ego check.

36:10.295 --> 36:11.630
We'll see to that.

36:11.713 --> 36:14.383
-What say we put some skin in the game?
-What do you have in mind?

36:14.466 --> 36:17.344
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

36:17.427 --> 36:20.180
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

36:20.264 --> 36:22.391
They don't call it an exercise
for nothing, sir.

36:22.474 --> 36:24.393
You got yourself a deal, gentlemen.

36:24.476 --> 36:26.770
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

36:28.355 --> 36:29.606
Fanboy, you see him?

36:29.690 --> 36:32.693
Nothing on radar up ahead.
He must be somewhere behind us.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.947
-Damn it!
-What the hell?

36:37.030 --> 36:37.865
Shit!

36:42.578 --> 36:43.412
Easy, Maverick.

36:43.495 --> 36:46.582
Let's try not to get fired
on the first day.

36:46.665 --> 36:49.585
Tally, tally, tally! Maverick's coming in!
Break left!

36:49.668 --> 36:50.836
Breaking left.

36:52.838 --> 36:54.882
Payback, where's your wingman?

36:54.965 --> 36:57.176
-Rooster, where are you?
-I got your back.

36:57.259 --> 36:59.761
I'm coming. Hang in there. Hang in there.

36:59.845 --> 37:01.180
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

37:04.933 --> 37:06.894
-Payback, break right.
-Breaking right.

37:08.270 --> 37:11.690
Rooster just saved your life, fellas.
But it's gonna cost him.

37:11.773 --> 37:13.442
Not this time, old man.

37:16.111 --> 37:17.738
Don't let him get to you, Maverick.

37:24.703 --> 37:27.331
Rooster, you're too low! Pull up!
You're hitting the hard deck!

37:27.414 --> 37:29.917
-Altitude. Altitude.
-Oh, shit.

37:34.338 --> 37:35.339
That's a kill.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.799
Down! 109.

37:38.759 --> 37:41.386
Down! 110.

37:43.305 --> 37:45.057
That should be us down there.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.266
But it's not.

37:47.059 --> 37:49.561
And now you know a little something
about Rooster.

37:51.563 --> 37:53.690
Hold that tarmac down till we get back,
brother, all right?

37:53.774 --> 37:55.484
Get in there, boys.

37:58.612 --> 38:00.364
-That's a kill.
-Damn!

38:01.114 --> 38:02.699
-Smoked.
-Damn it.

38:03.408 --> 38:06.036
It was all fun and games in that selfie,
wasn't it? Down!

38:06.119 --> 38:06.954
Say, Phoenix.

38:07.037 --> 38:09.873
How's about we tell everybody
"Bob" stands for something?

38:09.957 --> 38:12.292
-Other than Robert, I mean.
-Don't take the bait, Bob.

38:12.376 --> 38:14.419
Want to know why we call him Hangman?

38:14.503 --> 38:16.755
I got it. "Baby On Board."

38:19.174 --> 38:20.634
Shit!

38:21.927 --> 38:23.846
Greetings, aviators. Fight's on.

38:24.471 --> 38:26.723
All right, Phoenix,
let's take this guy out!

38:26.807 --> 38:27.975
Watch your back, Phoenix.

38:28.058 --> 38:29.935
-Break right!
-Breaking right.

38:32.354 --> 38:33.355
Where's he going?

38:33.438 --> 38:36.525
That's why we call him Hangman.
He'll always hang you out to dry.

38:37.526 --> 38:39.027
Leaving your wingman.

38:39.111 --> 38:40.779
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

38:40.863 --> 38:43.282
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

38:43.365 --> 38:44.783
So long as he doesn't call you a man.

38:44.867 --> 38:46.827
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

38:46.910 --> 38:48.912
Jesus, his nose is already coming around!

38:48.996 --> 38:50.372
Get him off me, Hangman!

38:50.455 --> 38:54.418
For all you folks at home,
this is how you bury a fossil.

38:54.501 --> 38:57.129
All right, Hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.089
-You're out, Phoenix.
-Son of a bitch!

39:00.382 --> 39:01.383
That's it.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.969
-Let's go, Mav. Let's see what you got.
-Come get me.

39:06.388 --> 39:08.098
Evil be gone. Hangman's coming.

39:09.308 --> 39:11.518
Yeah, you're good. I'll give you that.

39:18.025 --> 39:21.278
Shit.
Phoenix, I can't see him. How close am I?

39:21.361 --> 39:23.739
-Phoenix?
-I'm dead, dickhead.

39:23.822 --> 39:25.699
See you in the afterlife, Bagman.

39:27.117 --> 39:28.702
Where is he? Where is he?

39:29.411 --> 39:30.704
That's a kill.

39:31.413 --> 39:35.000
Seventy-nine. Down. Eighty. Down.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.251
Let's go. Who's next?

39:37.503 --> 39:39.254
-I got you, Omaha.
-Damn it!

39:42.299 --> 39:44.551
-Lights out, Coyote.
-Copy kill.

39:44.635 --> 39:49.097
Down. Fifty-one. Down. Fifty-two.

39:51.934 --> 39:54.937
So, Rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

39:55.020 --> 39:56.313
Would it matter if I did?

39:56.396 --> 39:58.649
What's the story with you and Maverick?

39:58.732 --> 40:01.777
-It seems like he's got you rattled.
-That's none of your business.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.695
Now where the hell is he?

40:03.779 --> 40:05.447
Been here the whole time.

40:06.532 --> 40:08.367
Holy shit.

40:10.452 --> 40:11.620
You see me now?

40:12.538 --> 40:14.331
Come on, let's get it over with.

40:14.957 --> 40:16.375
Fight's on!

40:18.085 --> 40:20.420
What is with these two?

40:24.967 --> 40:28.428
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

40:29.012 --> 40:31.098
You can bail out anytime.

40:31.181 --> 40:32.516
How low you want to go, Rooster?

40:32.599 --> 40:35.853
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

40:39.690 --> 40:41.692
What's past is past. For both of us.

40:41.775 --> 40:43.610
You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?

40:43.694 --> 40:46.780
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

40:47.781 --> 40:48.782
Altitude.

40:48.866 --> 40:50.868
Your strategy
is about to run us into the ground.

40:50.951 --> 40:53.412
-What's your move?
-Altitude. Altitude.

40:53.495 --> 40:54.872
Altitude.

40:56.665 --> 40:59.543
Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.

40:59.626 --> 41:02.045
Altitude. Altitude.

41:04.089 --> 41:06.758
Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!

41:07.467 --> 41:08.468
Pull up! Pull up!

41:11.722 --> 41:13.432
You got it. Don't think, just do.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.144
Come on, Rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

41:18.770 --> 41:19.688
It's too low.

41:20.731 --> 41:22.441
Too late. You had your chance.

41:28.572 --> 41:31.325
That's a kill. Knock it off.

41:32.326 --> 41:33.452
Damn it!

41:33.535 --> 41:35.412
Same old Rooster.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.292
Go see Hondo about your push-ups.

41:48.509 --> 41:50.010
All right, that's enough.

41:50.677 --> 41:52.763
Rooster. That's enough, man.

42:07.152 --> 42:10.822
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

42:10.906 --> 42:12.366
Don't worry about it.

42:12.866 --> 42:15.369
Look, I'm going on this mission.

42:16.328 --> 42:19.122
But if you get kicked out,
you leave us flying with Hangman.

42:19.748 --> 42:23.377
-Talk to me. What the hell was that?
-He pulled my papers.

42:23.460 --> 42:26.922
-What? Who?
-Maverick.

42:28.090 --> 42:30.634
He pulled my application
to the Naval Academy.

42:31.718 --> 42:33.720
Set me back four years.

42:36.223 --> 42:37.683
Why would he do that?

42:43.522 --> 42:46.066
The hard deck is 5,000 feet
above ground level.

42:46.149 --> 42:48.485
A parameter is set
not just for the safety of our pilots,

42:48.569 --> 42:50.070
but for the safety of their aircraft.

42:50.153 --> 42:54.366
5,000 feet is not just a rule.
It is a law, as immutable as gravity.

42:54.449 --> 42:57.119
The hard deck will be much lower
for the mission, sir.

42:57.202 --> 43:00.330
And it will not change
without my approval!

43:00.414 --> 43:02.332
Especially not in the middle
of an exercise.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.378
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

43:06.461 --> 43:08.338
I never want to see that shit again.

43:09.423 --> 43:11.675
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, Captain?

43:11.758 --> 43:14.178
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

43:14.261 --> 43:16.847
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, Captain.

43:16.930 --> 43:18.682
And they've been told that
their entire career,

43:18.765 --> 43:20.642
while they've been dropping bombs
from a high altitude

43:20.726 --> 43:22.477
with little to no dogfighting.

43:22.561 --> 43:25.314
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

43:25.397 --> 43:29.109
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

43:29.943 --> 43:31.236
and how to strike the target.

43:31.320 --> 43:33.071
And how to come home.

43:35.908 --> 43:37.910
And how to come home, sir.

43:43.582 --> 43:45.250
Every mission has its risks.

43:46.126 --> 43:48.003
These pilots accept that.

43:48.086 --> 43:49.671
I don't, sir.

43:53.884 --> 43:55.219
Every morning, from this day forward,

43:55.302 --> 43:58.013
you will brief us on
your instructional plans in writing.

43:58.096 --> 44:01.016
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

44:01.099 --> 44:04.269
-Including the hard deck, sir?
-Especially the hard deck, Captain.

44:06.355 --> 44:07.439
Sir.

44:08.357 --> 44:09.566
What is this?

44:09.650 --> 44:11.318
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

44:11.401 --> 44:13.820
to practice a low-level bombing run
per the mission parameters.

44:19.910 --> 44:22.538
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, Captain.

44:23.372 --> 44:24.331
Yo, Coyote.

44:25.040 --> 44:26.333
Take a look at this.

44:30.254 --> 44:32.965
The man, the legend. There he is.

44:33.048 --> 44:35.050
No, no, no. Next to him.

44:36.009 --> 44:38.053
He look familiar to you?

44:39.972 --> 44:41.598
What have we here?

44:42.391 --> 44:44.101
Bradshaw.

44:45.060 --> 44:46.728
As I live and breathe.

44:49.940 --> 44:52.484
Hey, Theo, you got big.

44:53.318 --> 44:54.444
Hey, Mav.

45:01.535 --> 45:02.578
Amelia?

45:02.661 --> 45:04.204
I know. I got big.

45:04.288 --> 45:05.539
Yes.

45:06.623 --> 45:07.916
Bar opens at 5:00.

45:08.750 --> 45:10.752
No, I just came by to pay off a debt.

45:10.836 --> 45:12.087
Mom!

45:16.800 --> 45:19.761
-Hey, how's your dad?
-With his wife, in Hawaii.

45:19.845 --> 45:21.221
Mom!

45:22.181 --> 45:24.308
Mav says he owes you money.

45:25.809 --> 45:27.811
-Don't worry about it.
-I insist.

45:31.023 --> 45:34.693
Thank you, Captain.
Consider your tab closed.

45:35.694 --> 45:37.571
Captain? Still?

45:38.197 --> 45:40.324
A highly decorated captain.

45:40.407 --> 45:41.450
Finish up.

45:41.533 --> 45:43.327
We have to get the boat to the yard.

45:43.410 --> 45:45.370
-I can't go.
-What do you mean, you can't go?

45:45.454 --> 45:48.790
Test tomorrow. I have to study.
They only told us today.

45:48.874 --> 45:50.834
Well, I can't sail her alone.

45:50.918 --> 45:52.336
Just use the engine.

45:52.419 --> 45:54.588
Why are we taking her to the yard?

45:55.214 --> 45:56.673
To fix the engine.

45:57.466 --> 45:58.467
I can help.

46:04.723 --> 46:07.935
-Little rougher than I was expecting.
-You don't say.

46:08.644 --> 46:11.605
Pull on the backstay.
We'll de-power the sails.

46:11.688 --> 46:12.689
Okay.

46:13.232 --> 46:14.816
What does that mean?

46:16.235 --> 46:18.487
You're supposed to be in the navy!

46:18.570 --> 46:21.907
I don't sail boats, Penny. I land on them.

46:22.449 --> 46:25.661
It's sort of like raising the flaps
on an airplane.

46:25.744 --> 46:27.204
So how do I do that?

46:27.955 --> 46:30.165
You pull on that green line up there.

46:30.249 --> 46:31.583
Green line.

46:34.127 --> 46:35.671
Yep. Pull it hard.

46:35.754 --> 46:38.674
Yep. Crank that winch right there,

46:38.757 --> 46:40.551
tighten the jib.

46:41.260 --> 46:43.595
-Crank it. You okay?
-Yeah.

46:45.138 --> 46:46.098
Good.

46:47.349 --> 46:48.350
Now,

46:49.768 --> 46:51.186
you ready?

46:53.105 --> 46:54.189
For what?

46:54.773 --> 46:56.316
The afterburner.

47:16.628 --> 47:18.463
Now you're in the navy.

47:40.736 --> 47:42.571
Thanks for helping out today.

47:44.281 --> 47:45.699
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

47:51.163 --> 47:52.664
Don't give me that look.

47:52.748 --> 47:54.082
What look?

47:54.166 --> 47:55.792
That one.

47:59.087 --> 48:00.380
Good night, Pete.

48:01.173 --> 48:02.508
Night, Penny.

48:17.981 --> 48:19.483
Mom, is that you?

48:20.108 --> 48:21.401
Yeah, it's me.

48:22.402 --> 48:24.112
I'll make you dinner.

48:24.196 --> 48:25.197
Okay.

48:31.411 --> 48:33.664
Time is your greatest enemy.

48:35.082 --> 48:37.209
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

48:37.292 --> 48:39.044
attacking in two-plane teams.

48:39.628 --> 48:41.839
You'll fly along this narrow canyon
to your target.

48:41.922 --> 48:45.342
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles
defend the area.

48:45.425 --> 48:47.678
These SAMs, they're lethal.

48:48.345 --> 48:52.224
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

48:52.307 --> 48:56.186
That's because the enemy knows no one is
insane enough to try and fly below them.

48:57.104 --> 48:59.064
That's exactly
what I'm gonna train you to do.

49:00.107 --> 49:04.319
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

49:04.403 --> 49:07.531
You exceed this altitude,
radar will spot you,

49:08.407 --> 49:09.908
and you're dead.

49:11.034 --> 49:12.995
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

49:13.829 --> 49:15.080
minimum.

49:15.163 --> 49:17.499
Time to target: two and a half minutes.

49:18.083 --> 49:21.837
That's because fifth-generation fighters
wait at an air base nearby.

49:22.713 --> 49:27.134
In a head-to-head with these planes
in your F-18s, you're dead.

49:27.885 --> 49:30.846
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

49:30.929 --> 49:34.099
before these planes
even have a chance of catching you.

49:34.183 --> 49:37.019
This makes time your greatest adversary.

49:38.854 --> 49:42.149
You'll fly a route in your nav system
that simulates the canyon.

49:42.941 --> 49:44.610
The faster you navigate this canyon,

49:44.693 --> 49:47.362
the harder it'll be to stay
under the radar of these enemy SAMs.

49:48.363 --> 49:49.489
The tighter the turns,

49:49.573 --> 49:52.784
the more intensely the force of gravity
on your body multiplies,

49:53.452 --> 49:55.204
compressing your lungs,

49:55.287 --> 49:56.705
forcing the blood from your brain,

49:56.788 --> 50:00.000
impairing your judgment and reaction time.

50:00.083 --> 50:02.461
So for today's lesson,
we're gonna take it easy on you.

50:02.544 --> 50:05.547
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: three minutes.

50:07.424 --> 50:08.634
Good luck.

50:17.059 --> 50:18.852
Time to target is one minute 30.

50:18.936 --> 50:21.355
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

50:21.438 --> 50:22.689
We got to move, Coyote.

50:23.565 --> 50:25.234
Copy. Increasing speed.

50:27.611 --> 50:28.529
Oh, shit!

50:32.324 --> 50:33.367
Why are they dead?

50:33.450 --> 50:36.245
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a SAM took us out.

50:36.328 --> 50:37.955
No. Why are they dead?

50:38.038 --> 50:40.374
I slowed down and didn't give her
a warning. It was my fault.

50:40.457 --> 50:42.292
Was there a reason
you didn't communicate with your team?

50:42.376 --> 50:43.502
I was focusing on--

50:43.585 --> 50:45.379
One that their family will accept
at the funeral.

50:46.380 --> 50:47.339
None, sir.

50:48.298 --> 50:51.343
Why didn't you anticipate the turn?
You were briefed on the terrain.

50:51.969 --> 50:54.680
Don't tell me. Tell it to his family.

51:00.102 --> 51:02.646
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

51:02.729 --> 51:05.315
Negative, Payback. Increase your speed.

51:06.942 --> 51:10.279
-You're going too fast, man.
-No harm in being ahead of schedule.

51:12.489 --> 51:15.450
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

51:15.534 --> 51:18.120
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

51:21.832 --> 51:24.543
-What happened?
-I flew as fast as I could.

51:25.127 --> 51:26.712
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

51:26.795 --> 51:30.007
And you put your team in danger,
and your wingman's dead.

51:31.216 --> 51:32.759
They couldn't keep up.

51:38.891 --> 51:41.518
Rooster,
we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.

51:41.602 --> 51:44.188
We're fine. Speed is good.

51:44.271 --> 51:45.814
Increase to 500 knots.

51:45.898 --> 51:48.942
-Negative, Yale. Hold your speed.
-Rooster, we're late!

51:49.026 --> 51:51.820
We're alive.
We'll make up time in the straightaway.

51:51.904 --> 51:53.488
We are not gonna make it.

51:53.572 --> 51:56.575
Just trust me. Maintain your speed.
We can make it.

51:56.658 --> 51:57.784
Why are you dead?

51:59.119 --> 52:03.081
You're team leader up there.
Why are you, why is your team dead?

52:03.165 --> 52:05.834
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

52:05.918 --> 52:07.127
A minute late.

52:07.920 --> 52:10.506
He gave enemy aircraft time
to shoot him down.

52:10.589 --> 52:12.424
-He is dead.
-You don't know that.

52:12.508 --> 52:16.011
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

52:16.094 --> 52:17.346
We made it to the target.

52:17.429 --> 52:21.141
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

52:21.225 --> 52:24.228
-Then it's a dogfight.
-Against fifth-generation fighters.

52:24.311 --> 52:26.897
-Yeah. We'd still have a chance.
-In an F-18.

52:26.980 --> 52:29.483
It's not the plane, sir, it's the pilot.

52:29.566 --> 52:30.692
Exactly!

52:37.824 --> 52:40.494
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

52:40.577 --> 52:42.538
You really don't get it.

52:43.539 --> 52:46.208
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

52:46.291 --> 52:48.126
or a man does not come back.

52:49.127 --> 52:51.213
No offense intended.

52:51.296 --> 52:53.590
Yet somehow you always manage.

52:55.133 --> 52:57.928
Look, I don't mean to criticize.
You're conservative, that's all.

52:58.011 --> 52:58.846
Lieutenant.

52:58.929 --> 53:03.517
We're going into combat, son,
on a level no living pilot's ever seen.

53:05.060 --> 53:06.186
Not even him.

53:08.188 --> 53:10.023
That's no time to be thinking
about the past.

53:14.111 --> 53:16.154
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Rooster.

53:16.238 --> 53:18.824
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

53:18.907 --> 53:20.367
-That's enough.
-Or that Maverick was flying

53:20.450 --> 53:22.160
-when his old man--
-Lieutenant, that's enough!

53:24.121 --> 53:25.998
-That's enough.
-You son of a bitch!

53:26.081 --> 53:27.040
Hey, come on!

53:27.124 --> 53:29.626
I'm cool, I'm cool. Hey, hey, hey.

53:29.710 --> 53:30.544
That's enough.

53:30.627 --> 53:32.713
-He's not cut out for this mission.
-That's enough!

53:32.796 --> 53:34.047
You know it.

53:37.092 --> 53:38.093
You know I'm right.

53:44.558 --> 53:45.684
You're all dismissed.

54:49.998 --> 54:51.375
Maverick.

54:53.710 --> 54:55.003
It's come back?

54:55.671 --> 54:57.130
No one knows.

54:59.299 --> 55:01.009
There's nothing else they can do.

55:01.885 --> 55:04.888
Even speaking is painful now.

55:10.894 --> 55:12.604
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

55:32.291 --> 55:33.292
Admiral.

55:44.845 --> 55:46.054
How's my wingman?

55:57.691 --> 55:59.985
Please, don't worry about me.

56:00.944 --> 56:02.696
What can I do for you?

56:11.163 --> 56:12.247
All right.

56:15.083 --> 56:18.212
Well, Rooster's still angry with me
about what I did.

56:19.713 --> 56:22.466
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

56:24.718 --> 56:26.386
I hoped he'd forgive me.

56:34.811 --> 56:36.730
The mission is less than three weeks away.

56:37.314 --> 56:38.899
The kid's not ready.

56:47.241 --> 56:49.201
He doesn't want what I have to give.

56:50.410 --> 56:51.662
Ice, please,

56:51.745 --> 56:54.081
don't ask me to send someone else to die.

56:54.164 --> 56:55.290
Please don't…

56:56.291 --> 56:57.876
Don't ask me to send him.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.545
Send me.

57:31.326 --> 57:32.995
I don't know how.

57:46.216 --> 57:47.968
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

57:50.387 --> 57:52.222
I'm a fighter pilot.

57:54.808 --> 57:56.226
A naval aviator.

57:58.729 --> 58:00.814
It's not what I am.

58:02.065 --> 58:03.650
It's who I am.

58:05.402 --> 58:07.154
How do I teach that?

58:09.031 --> 58:11.658
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what Rooster wants.

58:12.618 --> 58:14.786
It's not what the navy wants.

58:14.870 --> 58:17.206
That's why they canned me the last time.

58:20.042 --> 58:23.003
The only reason I'm here is you.

58:30.344 --> 58:32.179
If I send him on this mission,

58:33.597 --> 58:35.474
he might never come home.

58:39.228 --> 58:40.854
And if I don't send him,

58:41.563 --> 58:43.398
he'll never forgive me.

58:46.109 --> 58:48.570
Either way, I could lose him forever.

58:59.039 --> 59:00.040
I know.

59:00.874 --> 59:02.209
I know.

59:13.387 --> 59:17.015
The navy needs Maverick.

59:19.059 --> 59:22.604
The kid needs Maverick.

59:23.689 --> 59:25.941
That's why I fought for you.

59:27.943 --> 59:30.279
That's why you're still here.

59:38.328 --> 59:40.080
Thank you, Ice,

59:40.747 --> 59:42.165
for everything.

59:47.087 --> 59:48.547
One last thing.

59:49.173 --> 59:50.924
Who's the better pilot?

59:51.008 --> 59:52.301
You or me?

59:55.429 --> 59:58.015
This is a nice moment. Let's not ruin it.

1:00:38.388 --> 1:00:40.098
All right, all right.

1:00:50.317 --> 1:00:52.027
Touchdown!

1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:02.681
Sir.

1:02:02.764 --> 1:02:04.808
-What is this?
-This is dogfight football.

1:02:04.892 --> 1:02:07.060
Offense and defense at the same time.

1:02:07.895 --> 1:02:08.896
Who's winning?

1:02:08.979 --> 1:02:11.899
I think they stopped keeping score
a while ago.

1:02:11.982 --> 1:02:15.027
This detachment still has some training
to complete, Captain.

1:02:15.110 --> 1:02:17.321
-Every available minute matters.
-Yes, sir.

1:02:17.404 --> 1:02:19.615
So why are we out here playing games?

1:02:19.698 --> 1:02:21.575
You said to create a team, sir.

1:02:23.076 --> 1:02:24.620
There's your team.

1:04:04.011 --> 1:04:06.597
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:09.016
-She'll be at her friend's house tonight.
-Oh, good.

1:04:12.186 --> 1:04:13.854
You and Amelia, you seem…

1:04:16.607 --> 1:04:19.026
a lot closer than when I last saw you.

1:04:19.109 --> 1:04:21.528
-Yeah. Yeah, we are.
-How do you manage?

1:04:23.697 --> 1:04:24.823
Well,

1:04:26.491 --> 1:04:29.703
you know, she always wanted more freedom
than I thought she was ready for.

1:04:30.454 --> 1:04:32.414
Where'd she get that from, I wonder?

1:04:36.043 --> 1:04:37.461
I guess I realized

1:04:38.378 --> 1:04:40.464
I also had to trust her.

1:04:42.049 --> 1:04:44.551
Let her make some
of her own mistakes sometimes.

1:04:47.054 --> 1:04:48.722
Not an easy choice.

1:04:53.060 --> 1:04:55.062
Is that what happened with Rooster?

1:04:58.732 --> 1:05:01.485
I pulled his papers
from the Naval Academy.

1:05:04.530 --> 1:05:06.240
Took years off his career.

1:05:12.538 --> 1:05:13.539
Why?

1:05:16.458 --> 1:05:19.962
His mother never wanted him to fly,
not after what happened to Goose.

1:05:22.756 --> 1:05:26.176
She made me promise before she died, so…

1:05:26.260 --> 1:05:28.178
Does Rooster know that?

1:05:31.723 --> 1:05:34.768
He will always resent me for what I did.

1:05:36.770 --> 1:05:38.772
Why should he resent her too?

1:05:43.694 --> 1:05:45.404
Not an easy choice.

1:05:48.365 --> 1:05:50.868
I was trying to be the father he lost.

1:05:53.954 --> 1:05:54.955
I just--

1:05:57.833 --> 1:06:00.002
I wish I would've done it better.

1:06:02.254 --> 1:06:05.090
But the truth is…

1:06:07.634 --> 1:06:09.469
I didn't think he was ready.

1:06:13.056 --> 1:06:14.766
Is he ready now?

1:06:18.228 --> 1:06:19.646
Mom, I'm home!

1:06:21.398 --> 1:06:23.817
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

1:06:23.901 --> 1:06:26.653
Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.

1:06:26.737 --> 1:06:29.156
-I should go.
-You should go.

1:06:29.740 --> 1:06:32.534
-Have you had dinner yet?
-Not yet. You want to go out?

1:06:32.618 --> 1:06:35.579
No, it's okay. I'll make you something.

1:06:35.662 --> 1:06:36.747
I'll be down in a sec!

1:06:37.623 --> 1:06:39.583
-Wait! Not that way.
-What?

1:06:41.251 --> 1:06:43.462
Look, I have an example to set.

1:06:43.545 --> 1:06:46.006
I can't be bringing guys home
on a first date.

1:06:46.089 --> 1:06:47.424
This is not our first date.

1:06:48.592 --> 1:06:50.135
You know what I mean.

1:06:52.888 --> 1:06:53.889
Okay.

1:06:55.057 --> 1:06:56.099
Fine.

1:06:57.142 --> 1:06:59.436
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:00.979
We'll see.

1:07:01.063 --> 1:07:02.481
No. No, I mean it.

1:07:03.232 --> 1:07:05.150
I'm never gonna leave you again.

1:07:07.152 --> 1:07:08.779
Oh, shut up.

1:07:08.862 --> 1:07:10.739
Go on, get out of here.

1:07:24.294 --> 1:07:26.255
Just don't break her heart again.

1:07:38.225 --> 1:07:39.226
Good morning.

1:07:39.309 --> 1:07:41.436
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:43.981
will be operational earlier than expected.

1:07:44.064 --> 1:07:47.192
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

1:07:47.901 --> 1:07:50.988
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

1:07:51.071 --> 1:07:54.700
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

1:07:54.783 --> 1:07:57.619
Sir, no one here has successfully flown
a low-level course.

1:07:57.703 --> 1:07:59.621
Nevertheless,
you've been ordered to move on.

1:08:00.831 --> 1:08:01.832
Captain.

1:08:04.877 --> 1:08:07.254
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

1:08:07.337 --> 1:08:09.214
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

1:08:09.298 --> 1:08:11.091
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive,

1:08:11.175 --> 1:08:14.094
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

1:08:15.262 --> 1:08:18.432
Two pairs of F-18s will fly
in a welded wing formation.

1:08:18.515 --> 1:08:19.765
Teamwork.

1:08:19.850 --> 1:08:22.352
Precise coordination of these aircraft
is essential

1:08:22.435 --> 1:08:25.147
to both the mission's success
and your survival.

1:08:25.229 --> 1:08:27.941
As you know,
the plant rests between two mountains.

1:08:28.066 --> 1:08:32.112
On final approach,
you'll invert directly into a steep dive.

1:08:33.113 --> 1:08:35.782
This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude

1:08:36.992 --> 1:08:38.785
and the only possible attack angle.

1:08:42.538 --> 1:08:46.376
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

1:08:47.627 --> 1:08:50.546
The two-seat aircraft will paint
the target with a laser bull's-eye.

1:08:52.006 --> 1:08:53.884
The first pair will breach the reactor

1:08:53.966 --> 1:08:57.638
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:59.932
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

1:09:00.765 --> 1:09:02.225
That's miracle number one.

1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:05.979
The second team

1:09:06.063 --> 1:09:07.397
will deliver the kill shot

1:09:08.732 --> 1:09:10.526
and destroy the target.

1:09:11.777 --> 1:09:13.111
That's miracle number two.

1:09:14.488 --> 1:09:16.740
If either team misses the target…

1:09:19.033 --> 1:09:19.910
That's a miss.

1:09:19.993 --> 1:09:21.995
-…the mission is a failure.
-Damn it!

1:09:22.703 --> 1:09:26.500
Egress is a steep high-G climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain.

1:09:29.377 --> 1:09:32.673
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight G's.

1:09:32.756 --> 1:09:34.258
Nine, minimum.

1:09:34.341 --> 1:09:37.135
The stress limit
of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

1:09:37.219 --> 1:09:38.595
That's the accepted limit.

1:09:38.679 --> 1:09:40.889
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

1:09:40.973 --> 1:09:43.642
even if it means bending your airframe.

1:09:44.977 --> 1:09:48.354
You'll be pulling so hard,
you'll weigh close to 2,000 pounds,

1:09:48.438 --> 1:09:51.316
your skull crushing your spine,

1:09:51.441 --> 1:09:54.486
your lungs imploding
like an elephant's sitting on your chest,

1:09:54.570 --> 1:09:57.990
fighting with everything you have
just to keep from blacking out.

1:10:00.075 --> 1:10:02.578
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

1:10:03.537 --> 1:10:06.415
This is Coffin Corner.

1:10:06.498 --> 1:10:09.251
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

1:10:09.334 --> 1:10:12.921
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar
while losing all of your airspeed.

1:10:13.505 --> 1:10:16.133
Within seconds,
you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.

1:10:17.634 --> 1:10:19.845
You've all faced sustained G's before,
but this--

1:10:20.596 --> 1:10:24.266
this is gonna take you and your aircraft
to the breaking point.

1:10:24.349 --> 1:10:27.102
Sir, is this even achievable?

1:10:27.186 --> 1:10:28.854
The answer to that question

1:10:29.438 --> 1:10:31.440
will come down to the pilot in the box.

1:10:41.366 --> 1:10:43.619
-Talk to me, Bob.
-We are 12 seconds late on target.

1:10:43.702 --> 1:10:46.413
-We got to move! We got to move!
-Copy. Try to stay with me.

1:10:50.417 --> 1:10:51.627
Wait, who's that?

1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:54.296
Blue Team, you've been spotted.

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:57.007
-Shit, it's Maverick.
-What the hell is he doing here?

1:10:57.090 --> 1:11:00.219
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue Team, what are you gonna do?

1:11:00.302 --> 1:11:03.514
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

1:11:03.597 --> 1:11:05.432
Your call. What do you want to do?

1:11:05.516 --> 1:11:08.227
Continue. We're close. Stay on target.

1:11:08.310 --> 1:11:11.522
-He's swinging around to the north!
-Stand by for pop-up.

1:11:11.605 --> 1:11:13.690
-Be ready on that laser, Bob.
-Copy. I'm on it.

1:11:15.943 --> 1:11:17.653
Blue Team, bandit is still closing.

1:11:17.736 --> 1:11:18.904
Popping now.

1:11:25.077 --> 1:11:27.204
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

1:11:27.287 --> 1:11:29.331
He's five miles out. He's coming fast.

1:11:35.212 --> 1:11:37.714
-Target's in sight.
-Where's my laser, Bob?

1:11:38.549 --> 1:11:41.927
Deadeye! Deadeye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

1:11:42.010 --> 1:11:43.846
We're out of time. I'm dropping blind.

1:11:47.099 --> 1:11:48.517
Damn it, missed!

1:12:00.112 --> 1:12:02.281
-That's tone.
-Maverick's got missile lock on us.

1:12:02.364 --> 1:12:03.407
Shit! We're dead.

1:12:04.241 --> 1:12:06.994
Blue Team, that's a fail.
Level out, Coyote.

1:12:09.663 --> 1:12:11.582
Coyote? Do you copy?

1:12:14.418 --> 1:12:15.878
Coyote, come in.

1:12:16.503 --> 1:12:18.422
Coyote, level wings.

1:12:18.505 --> 1:12:20.090
Oh, God. He's in G-LOC.

1:12:20.841 --> 1:12:23.385
Coyote? Coyote?

1:12:23.468 --> 1:12:25.679
-He's gonna burn in!
-I'm going after him.

1:12:29.391 --> 1:12:31.685
Come on.
Give me tone, give me tone, give me tone.

1:12:32.227 --> 1:12:34.646
Snap out of it, Coyote. Come on! Come on!

1:12:37.691 --> 1:12:40.444
Come on, Coyote, come on. Come on!

1:12:40.527 --> 1:12:42.696
-Damn it! Coyote!
-Pull up!

1:12:42.779 --> 1:12:45.407
-Coyote! Coyote!
-Pull up! Pull up!

1:12:50.621 --> 1:12:52.414
Coyote, you okay?

1:12:53.457 --> 1:12:55.209
I'm okay. I'm good.

1:12:56.210 --> 1:12:59.046
Good. Good. That's enough for today.

1:13:01.256 --> 1:13:02.466
That was close.

1:13:03.050 --> 1:13:03.967
Too close.

1:13:04.843 --> 1:13:07.012
Bird strike! Bird strike!

1:13:07.095 --> 1:13:08.222
Bird strike!

1:13:11.558 --> 1:13:14.228
-Phoenix, left engine's on fire!
-Climbing.

1:13:16.230 --> 1:13:18.732
Throttling back.
Shutting off fuel to left engine.

1:13:18.815 --> 1:13:20.442
Extinguishing fire.

1:13:22.819 --> 1:13:23.820
Right engine is out!

1:13:23.904 --> 1:13:25.572
It's still spinning. Trying to restart it.

1:13:28.075 --> 1:13:30.702
-Phoenix, it's on fire. Don't start it.
-Throttling up.

1:13:32.287 --> 1:13:33.539
Oh, my God.

1:13:36.917 --> 1:13:39.336
-We're on fire! We're on fire!
-Damn it!

1:13:39.419 --> 1:13:42.172
-Engine fire. Right.
-Extinguishing right engine.

1:13:45.467 --> 1:13:47.386
Phoenix, Bob, punch out, punch out!

1:13:47.469 --> 1:13:49.680
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

1:13:49.763 --> 1:13:51.473
-Flight controls.
-I can't control it.

1:13:51.557 --> 1:13:54.309
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

1:13:54.393 --> 1:13:57.020
You can't save it. Eject, eject!

1:13:57.104 --> 1:13:58.272
Eject, eject, eject!

1:13:58.355 --> 1:14:01.191
Altitude. Altitude.

1:14:22.713 --> 1:14:25.716
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob
in the hospital overnight for observation.

1:14:25.799 --> 1:14:27.301
They're gonna be okay.

1:14:31.388 --> 1:14:32.723
That's good.

1:14:35.976 --> 1:14:37.811
I've never lost a wingman.

1:14:38.562 --> 1:14:39.771
You're lucky.

1:14:40.355 --> 1:14:42.191
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

1:14:44.985 --> 1:14:46.653
There will be others.

1:14:49.406 --> 1:14:51.408
Easy for you to say. No wife.

1:14:53.368 --> 1:14:54.578
No kids.

1:14:55.412 --> 1:14:57.915
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

1:15:01.168 --> 1:15:02.503
Go home.

1:15:03.629 --> 1:15:05.088
Just get some sleep.

1:15:07.633 --> 1:15:09.843
Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?

1:15:09.927 --> 1:15:11.553
Why did you stand in my way?

1:15:14.139 --> 1:15:15.474
You weren't ready.

1:15:15.557 --> 1:15:16.850
Ready for what?

1:15:18.519 --> 1:15:20.312
-Ready to fly like you?
-No.

1:15:20.395 --> 1:15:22.022
Ready to forget the book.

1:15:22.105 --> 1:15:24.816
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:27.569
You think up there, you're dead.
Believe me.

1:15:28.862 --> 1:15:30.531
My dad believed in you.

1:15:33.242 --> 1:15:35.702
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

1:15:41.375 --> 1:15:42.876
Maverick.

1:15:53.428 --> 1:15:56.306
Ready, aim, fire.

1:16:01.061 --> 1:16:02.229
Ready,

1:16:02.729 --> 1:16:03.772
aim,

1:16:04.314 --> 1:16:05.649
fire.

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:16.910
Ready,

1:16:17.953 --> 1:16:19.329
aim,

1:16:19.413 --> 1:16:20.706
fire.

1:16:54.489 --> 1:16:56.658
I can only imagine
what you must be feeling right now.

1:16:57.743 --> 1:16:59.995
Take some time. Whatever you need.

1:17:01.455 --> 1:17:03.624
I appreciate that, sir,
but there is no time. The mission--

1:17:03.707 --> 1:17:05.792
I'll be taking over the training
from here.

1:17:06.793 --> 1:17:07.794
Sir?

1:17:09.213 --> 1:17:11.006
We both know you didn't want this job,
Captain.

1:17:11.089 --> 1:17:13.425
-Sir, they're not ready.
-It was your job to get them ready.

1:17:13.509 --> 1:17:16.970
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1:17:17.054 --> 1:17:19.806
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1:17:20.641 --> 1:17:22.976
-Sir--
-You're grounded, Captain.

1:17:23.060 --> 1:17:24.561
Permanently.

1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:29.733
-Sir--
-That is all.

1:17:48.252 --> 1:17:49.253
I heard.

1:17:51.547 --> 1:17:52.714
I'm sorry.

1:17:53.590 --> 1:17:55.259
What are you gonna do?

1:17:56.426 --> 1:17:57.719
Ice is gone.

1:18:00.264 --> 1:18:01.974
What choice do I have?

1:18:03.183 --> 1:18:05.769
You'll have to find a way back
on your own.

1:18:05.853 --> 1:18:07.104
No, Penny.

1:18:08.897 --> 1:18:10.232
I'm out.

1:18:11.984 --> 1:18:13.235
This is over.

1:18:13.777 --> 1:18:14.778
Pete.

1:18:14.862 --> 1:18:17.322
If you lost your wingman up there,

1:18:18.073 --> 1:18:19.783
you'd keep fighting.

1:18:19.867 --> 1:18:21.159
You wouldn't just give up.

1:18:21.952 --> 1:18:23.912
Those are your pilots.

1:18:25.205 --> 1:18:27.374
If anything happens to them,

1:18:28.208 --> 1:18:30.252
you'll never forgive yourself.

1:18:34.298 --> 1:18:36.175
I don't know what to do.

1:18:40.220 --> 1:18:41.763
But you'll find a way.

1:18:44.183 --> 1:18:45.392
I know you will.

1:18:47.561 --> 1:18:49.938
Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.

1:18:50.022 --> 1:18:52.441
And as of today,
there are new mission parameters.

1:18:53.192 --> 1:18:55.068
Time to target is now four minutes.

1:18:55.819 --> 1:18:58.363
You'll be entering the valley level
at reduced speed.

1:18:58.447 --> 1:19:01.408
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1:19:01.491 --> 1:19:04.286
Sir, won't we be giving their planes
time to intercept?

1:19:04.369 --> 1:19:06.872
Well, Lieutenant, you have
a fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1:19:06.955 --> 1:19:10.042
What are the odds of surviving
a head-on collision with a mountain?

1:19:10.125 --> 1:19:12.711
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1:19:12.794 --> 1:19:14.004
level with the north wall.

1:19:14.087 --> 1:19:16.507
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1:19:16.590 --> 1:19:18.509
but you will avoid the high-G climb out.

1:19:18.592 --> 1:19:20.802
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.

1:19:26.225 --> 1:19:27.476
Who the hell is that?

1:19:29.269 --> 1:19:32.105
Maverick to Range Control.
Entering Point Alpha.

1:19:32.189 --> 1:19:33.857
Confirm green range.

1:19:34.483 --> 1:19:36.818
Maverick, Range Control,

1:19:36.902 --> 1:19:38.529
green range is confirmed.

1:19:38.612 --> 1:19:41.990
I don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.

1:19:42.074 --> 1:19:43.283
Well, I'm going anyway.

1:19:43.951 --> 1:19:45.202
Nice.

1:19:45.953 --> 1:19:48.997
Setting time to target:
Two minutes 15 seconds.

1:19:49.081 --> 1:19:50.832
2:15? That's impossible.

1:19:50.916 --> 1:19:53.460
Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.

1:21:31.141 --> 1:21:34.353
Popping in three, two, one.

1:22:00.838 --> 1:22:02.214
Bombs away.

1:22:19.690 --> 1:22:21.608
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1:22:22.901 --> 1:22:24.486
Yes.

1:22:27.364 --> 1:22:28.490
Damn.

1:22:41.253 --> 1:22:43.463
You have put me
in a difficult position, Captain.

1:22:44.381 --> 1:22:48.135
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1:22:48.218 --> 1:22:50.304
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.

1:22:51.722 --> 1:22:53.432
On the other hand,

1:22:53.515 --> 1:22:56.435
you did it by stealing
a multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1:22:56.518 --> 1:22:59.396
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1:23:00.814 --> 1:23:03.108
Iceman is no longer here to protect you.

1:23:03.942 --> 1:23:06.570
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1:23:06.653 --> 1:23:08.405
and dishonorably discharged.

1:23:09.198 --> 1:23:10.574
So what do I do?

1:23:11.575 --> 1:23:14.703
Risk the lives of my pilots
and perhaps the success of this mission

1:23:16.205 --> 1:23:17.206
or…

1:23:18.749 --> 1:23:20.209
risk my career

1:23:21.293 --> 1:23:23.045
by appointing you team leader?

1:23:26.381 --> 1:23:27.382
Sir--

1:23:27.466 --> 1:23:31.094
I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, Captain.

1:25:11.945 --> 1:25:13.530
Talk to me, Goose.

1:25:16.867 --> 1:25:18.368
Captain Mitchell!

1:25:25.334 --> 1:25:27.002
You're where you belong.

1:25:31.924 --> 1:25:33.425
Make us proud.

1:25:59.535 --> 1:26:01.662
It has been an honor flying with you.

1:26:02.746 --> 1:26:06.208
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.711
This is a very specific mission.

1:26:10.546 --> 1:26:13.841
My choice is a reflection of that
and nothing more.

1:26:13.924 --> 1:26:15.759
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.

1:26:17.344 --> 1:26:18.971
Payback and Fanboy.

1:26:20.055 --> 1:26:21.390
Phoenix and Bob.

1:26:25.686 --> 1:26:26.979
And your wingman.

1:26:31.775 --> 1:26:32.776
Rooster.

1:26:37.322 --> 1:26:39.616
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1:26:39.700 --> 1:26:42.578
for any reserve role that's required.

1:26:43.453 --> 1:26:44.621
Dismissed.

1:26:52.421 --> 1:26:55.257
Your target is a clear and present threat.

1:26:56.758 --> 1:27:00.596
A secret uranium enrichment site
under rogue state control.

1:27:01.221 --> 1:27:02.598
It's an underground bunker,

1:27:02.681 --> 1:27:04.474
tucked between these two mountains.

1:27:05.934 --> 1:27:09.730
Your route of ingress is heavily defended
by surface-to-air missiles

1:27:09.813 --> 1:27:12.316
backed up by fifth-generation fighters.

1:27:12.399 --> 1:27:15.152
Once your F-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1:27:15.235 --> 1:27:17.237
Tomahawk missiles from the USS Leyte Gulf

1:27:17.321 --> 1:27:20.949
will launch a synchronized strike
on the enemy's airfield here.

1:27:22.242 --> 1:27:24.453
This will knock out their runway.

1:27:26.246 --> 1:27:29.625
But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.

1:27:29.708 --> 1:27:32.544
The moment those Tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1:27:33.754 --> 1:27:37.799
Your time to target
will be two minutes and 30 seconds.

1:27:39.468 --> 1:27:41.470
Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed

1:27:41.553 --> 1:27:44.181
to any aircraft
the Tomahawks may have missed.

1:27:47.559 --> 1:27:49.978
This is what you've all been training for.

1:27:51.939 --> 1:27:53.440
Come home safely.

1:28:08.121 --> 1:28:09.873
You give 'em hell!

1:28:22.511 --> 1:28:23.512
Sir.

1:28:24.012 --> 1:28:25.013
Sir?

1:28:27.266 --> 1:28:28.267
I…

1:28:31.186 --> 1:28:32.813
I just want to say--

1:28:41.905 --> 1:28:43.240
We'll talk

1:28:44.741 --> 1:28:46.118
when we get back.

1:28:52.207 --> 1:28:54.001
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1:28:55.127 --> 1:28:56.128
Hey.

1:28:59.631 --> 1:29:01.049
You got this.

1:29:09.474 --> 1:29:10.475
Maverick.

1:29:12.728 --> 1:29:13.562
Maverick?

1:29:15.522 --> 1:29:17.441
Hey, you with me?

1:29:19.026 --> 1:29:20.861
I don't like that look, Mav.

1:29:23.697 --> 1:29:25.199
It's the only one I got.

1:29:29.828 --> 1:29:31.163
Thank you.

1:29:32.664 --> 1:29:34.750
If I don't see you again, Hondo,

1:29:34.833 --> 1:29:36.168
thank you.

1:29:43.926 --> 1:29:45.761
It's been an honor, Captain.

1:30:18.919 --> 1:30:21.964
Dagger One, up and ready on Catapult One.

1:30:22.047 --> 1:30:24.174
Dagger Spare standing by.

1:30:24.258 --> 1:30:26.051
Dagger Four, up and ready.

1:30:26.134 --> 1:30:27.636
Dagger Three, up and ready.

1:30:27.719 --> 1:30:29.847
Dagger Two, up and ready.

1:30:31.014 --> 1:30:33.684
Support assets airborne.
Strike package ready.

1:30:33.767 --> 1:30:35.644
Standing by for launch decision.

1:30:36.270 --> 1:30:37.271
Send them.

1:30:57.916 --> 1:30:59.209
Dagger Two away.

1:31:00.210 --> 1:31:02.171
Dagger Three away.

1:31:02.754 --> 1:31:04.173
Dagger Four away.

1:31:15.184 --> 1:31:17.603
Comanche, Dagger One. Standby check in.

1:31:18.979 --> 1:31:20.439
Comanche 11, set.

1:31:20.522 --> 1:31:22.774
Picture clean. Recommend Dagger continue.

1:31:22.858 --> 1:31:24.818
Copy. Daggers descending below radar.

1:31:44.713 --> 1:31:47.382
Daggers now below radar.
Switching to E-2 picture.

1:31:55.891 --> 1:31:58.477
Here we go. Enemy territory up ahead.

1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:01.522
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, Dagger One. Picture.

1:32:01.605 --> 1:32:04.399
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

1:32:04.483 --> 1:32:05.776
Copy.

1:32:14.076 --> 1:32:15.202
Dagger attack.

1:32:20.499 --> 1:32:21.792
Tomahawks airborne.

1:32:21.875 --> 1:32:23.961
No turning back now.

1:32:29.716 --> 1:32:31.760
Daggers, assume attack formation.

1:32:40.853 --> 1:32:42.813
Daggers set. Proceeding to target.

1:32:42.896 --> 1:32:47.442
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, mark.

1:32:47.526 --> 1:32:48.861
-Two mark.
-Three mark.

1:32:48.944 --> 1:32:49.820
Four mark.

1:32:54.783 --> 1:32:55.701
Going in.

1:33:11.341 --> 1:33:13.552
First SAM site overhead.

1:33:17.931 --> 1:33:19.433
Looks like we're clear on radar, Mav.

1:33:19.516 --> 1:33:21.268
Let's not take it for granted.

1:33:24.771 --> 1:33:26.982
More SAMs! Three o'clock high!

1:33:29.318 --> 1:33:31.695
-We got two minutes to target.
-Copy.

1:33:31.778 --> 1:33:34.114
We're a few seconds behind, Rooster.
We got to move.

1:33:35.657 --> 1:33:38.535
Thirty seconds to Tomahawk impact
on enemy airstrip.

1:33:46.919 --> 1:33:47.920
Dagger, Comanche.

1:33:48.003 --> 1:33:50.172
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

1:33:50.255 --> 1:33:53.008
-Where the hell'd they come from?
-Long-range patrol?

1:33:58.013 --> 1:33:59.473
Comanche, what's their heading?

1:33:59.556 --> 1:34:02.059
Bull's-eye 090, 50, tacked southwest.

1:34:02.142 --> 1:34:04.228
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

1:34:04.311 --> 1:34:06.271
The second those Tomahawks
hit the air base,

1:34:06.355 --> 1:34:08.524
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1:34:08.607 --> 1:34:11.193
We have to get there before they do.
Increase speed.

1:34:12.569 --> 1:34:14.863
We got you, Mav. Don't wait for me.

1:34:20.827 --> 1:34:23.830
Sir, Daggers Two and Four
are behind schedule.

1:34:23.914 --> 1:34:25.916
Time to target, one minute 20.

1:34:27.125 --> 1:34:29.294
Tomahawk impact in three, two…

1:34:33.674 --> 1:34:36.134
Impact. Enemy runway is destroyed.

1:34:36.927 --> 1:34:38.595
They know we're coming now.

1:34:41.974 --> 1:34:44.309
Bandits are switching course
to defend the target.

1:34:44.393 --> 1:34:45.519
Rooster, where are you?

1:34:47.229 --> 1:34:48.981
Come on, Rooster. Bandits inbound.

1:34:49.064 --> 1:34:51.233
We got to make up time now.
Let's turn and burn.

1:34:59.199 --> 1:35:00.242
Heads up, Phoenix.

1:35:10.043 --> 1:35:14.423
Sir, bandits are two minutes from target.
Daggers are one minute from target.

1:35:14.506 --> 1:35:16.800
Come on, Rooster. Move it or lose it.

1:35:19.052 --> 1:35:21.889
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really got to move.

1:35:21.972 --> 1:35:23.765
If we don't increase our speed right now,

1:35:23.849 --> 1:35:26.643
those bandits are gonna be waiting for us
when we reach the target.

1:35:28.437 --> 1:35:29.646
Talk to me, Dad.

1:35:30.981 --> 1:35:32.482
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1:35:32.566 --> 1:35:34.610
Don't think, just do.

1:35:43.118 --> 1:35:44.578
Jesus, Rooster, not that fast!

1:35:44.661 --> 1:35:47.206
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1:35:51.293 --> 1:35:53.045
Damn, Rooster, take it easy.

1:35:53.712 --> 1:35:56.340
Sir, Dagger Two is reengaging.

1:35:56.423 --> 1:35:58.800
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

1:36:03.222 --> 1:36:05.933
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

1:36:06.016 --> 1:36:09.520
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

1:36:09.603 --> 1:36:10.687
Laser is a go!

1:36:13.023 --> 1:36:14.399
Watch your heads.

1:36:16.151 --> 1:36:17.611
Holy shit!

1:36:17.694 --> 1:36:19.613
-Payback, you with me?
-Right behind you.

1:36:20.697 --> 1:36:22.533
Phoenix, stand by for pop-up strike.

1:36:22.616 --> 1:36:23.951
Dagger Three in position.

1:36:24.618 --> 1:36:27.287
Popping in three, two, one.

1:36:55.315 --> 1:36:57.568
-Get me eyes on that target, Bob.
-Dagger Three.

1:36:58.443 --> 1:36:59.736
Stand by, Mav.

1:36:59.820 --> 1:37:02.239
-Come on, Bob, come on.
-Stand by.

1:37:02.823 --> 1:37:05.576
-I've got it. Captured!
-Target acquired. Bombs away.

1:37:26.638 --> 1:37:30.017
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1:37:30.100 --> 1:37:31.935
That's miracle number one.

1:37:32.603 --> 1:37:34.021
Dagger Two, status.

1:37:34.104 --> 1:37:35.606
Almost there, Mav. Almost there.

1:37:38.275 --> 1:37:39.860
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1:37:40.444 --> 1:37:42.571
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser.

1:37:42.654 --> 1:37:44.281
Shit! Deadeye, deadeye, deadeye!

1:37:44.364 --> 1:37:46.700
Come on, guys, we're running out of time.
Get it online!

1:37:46.783 --> 1:37:48.243
-I'm trying!
-Come on, Fanboy!

1:37:48.327 --> 1:37:49.995
Nearly there! Nearly there!

1:37:58.879 --> 1:38:01.465
-Come on, Fanboy, get it online.
-There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1:38:01.548 --> 1:38:03.759
-Rooster, I got this!
-No time. Pull up.

1:38:03.842 --> 1:38:05.219
-Wait!
-Bombs away! Bombs away!

1:38:18.774 --> 1:38:20.609
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye, bull's-eye!

1:38:24.571 --> 1:38:25.864
Miracle number two.

1:38:25.948 --> 1:38:27.574
Now they're in Coffin Corner.

1:38:27.658 --> 1:38:29.743
We're not out of this yet.

1:38:31.578 --> 1:38:32.996
Here it comes.

1:38:36.041 --> 1:38:38.210
Radar warning! Smoke in the air.
Phoenix, break right.

1:38:38.293 --> 1:38:40.587
Emergency jettison.
Dagger Three defending.

1:38:40.671 --> 1:38:42.464
Here comes another one!

1:38:42.548 --> 1:38:44.216
Dagger One defending.

1:38:50.514 --> 1:38:51.598
Rooster, status.

1:38:59.815 --> 1:39:00.816
Oh, my God.

1:39:03.026 --> 1:39:04.444
Smoke in the air!

1:39:05.821 --> 1:39:07.698
-Break right, Payback!
-Breaking right.

1:39:09.116 --> 1:39:10.951
Oh, my God, here they come!

1:39:11.034 --> 1:39:12.411
SAM on your six, Rooster!

1:39:13.871 --> 1:39:15.247
Deploying countermeasures.

1:39:18.083 --> 1:39:19.585
Negative contact.

1:39:21.628 --> 1:39:22.713
Dagger One defending.

1:39:24.131 --> 1:39:27.009
-Talk to me, Bob.
-Break right, Phoenix! Break right! Mav!

1:39:27.092 --> 1:39:28.594
Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!

1:39:29.428 --> 1:39:31.388
Rooster, two more on your six.

1:39:31.471 --> 1:39:32.931
Dagger Two, defending.

1:39:37.519 --> 1:39:39.855
-Payback, SAM on your nose.
-Dagger Four defending.

1:39:39.938 --> 1:39:41.523
-Rooster, tally, seven o'clock!
-Talk to me, Bob!

1:39:41.607 --> 1:39:42.941
-On our six!
-Dagger Two defending.

1:39:43.025 --> 1:39:44.693
-Phoenix, break right!
-I see it!

1:39:52.075 --> 1:39:53.452
Dagger Two defending.

1:39:54.828 --> 1:39:55.996
Shit, I'm out of flares!

1:39:56.079 --> 1:39:58.415
Rooster, evade, evade!

1:39:58.498 --> 1:40:00.751
I can't shake 'em!
They're on me! They're on me!

1:40:10.886 --> 1:40:12.513
Mav! No!

1:40:14.515 --> 1:40:18.018
Dagger One is hit!
I repeat, Dagger One is hit!

1:40:18.101 --> 1:40:19.603
Maverick is down.

1:40:19.686 --> 1:40:20.854
Dagger One, status.

1:40:20.938 --> 1:40:22.564
Status!

1:40:22.648 --> 1:40:24.775
Anyone see him? Does anyone see him?

1:40:24.858 --> 1:40:27.069
-Dagger One, come in!
-I didn't see a parachute.

1:40:27.194 --> 1:40:28.820
We have to circle back.

1:40:28.904 --> 1:40:31.406
Comanche. Bandits inbound.
Single group, hot.

1:40:31.490 --> 1:40:32.991
Recommend Dagger flow south.

1:40:33.825 --> 1:40:35.827
One minute to intercept.

1:40:39.081 --> 1:40:40.666
Get 'em back to the carrier now.

1:40:40.749 --> 1:40:43.252
All Daggers flow to ECP.
You have bandits headed for you.

1:40:43.335 --> 1:40:44.378
What about Maverick?

1:40:44.461 --> 1:40:47.464
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn F-18.

1:40:47.548 --> 1:40:50.384
Dagger Spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1:40:52.678 --> 1:40:53.679
Negative, Spare.

1:40:54.847 --> 1:40:57.391
-Launch search and rescue.
-Negative. Not with bandits in the air.

1:40:57.474 --> 1:41:01.019
-But, sir, Maverick is still out there.
-We are not losing anyone else today.

1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:04.481
Get 'em home now.

1:41:04.565 --> 1:41:07.109
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1:41:07.192 --> 1:41:09.278
Repeat, do not engage.

1:41:09.361 --> 1:41:12.447
Dagger Two, return to carrier.
Acknowledge.

1:41:12.531 --> 1:41:13.532
Acknowledge.

1:41:13.615 --> 1:41:17.077
Rooster, those bandits are closing.
We can't go back.

1:41:17.160 --> 1:41:20.038
Rooster, he's gone.

1:41:21.707 --> 1:41:23.208
Maverick's gone.

1:42:53.674 --> 1:42:54.675
Oh, no, no.

1:43:01.431 --> 1:43:02.891
Dagger Two is hit.

1:43:04.059 --> 1:43:05.143
Dagger Two is hit.

1:43:06.728 --> 1:43:08.105
Dagger Two, come in.

1:43:09.815 --> 1:43:11.650
Dagger Two, do you copy?

1:43:12.317 --> 1:43:14.611
Dagger Two, come in.

1:43:39.887 --> 1:43:41.096
You all right?

1:43:41.180 --> 1:43:42.764
Yeah, I'm good. You all right?

1:43:45.350 --> 1:43:46.435
What the hell?

1:43:46.518 --> 1:43:48.896
-What are you doing here?
-What am I doing here?

1:43:48.979 --> 1:43:51.356
You think I took that missile
so you could be down here with me?

1:43:51.440 --> 1:43:53.275
You should be back on the carrier by now!

1:43:53.358 --> 1:43:55.068
I saved your life!

1:43:55.194 --> 1:43:58.280
I saved your life. That's the whole point.

1:43:58.363 --> 1:44:00.157
What the hell were you even thinking?

1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:02.284
You told me not to think!

1:44:19.009 --> 1:44:20.093
Well,

1:44:21.428 --> 1:44:22.804
it's good to see you.

1:44:25.224 --> 1:44:26.850
It's good to see you too.

1:44:30.896 --> 1:44:32.356
So what's the plan?

1:44:43.325 --> 1:44:44.701
You're not serious.

1:45:00.217 --> 1:45:01.844
You've got to be shitting me.

1:45:03.846 --> 1:45:04.888
An F-14?

1:45:05.597 --> 1:45:07.391
I shot down three MiGs in one of those.

1:45:07.474 --> 1:45:09.893
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1:45:12.604 --> 1:45:14.565
-Let's find out.
-Mav!

1:45:16.441 --> 1:45:17.442
Okay.

1:45:26.994 --> 1:45:28.996
-There's guys up there, Mav.
-Yeah.

1:45:30.247 --> 1:45:32.165
-There's more over there.
-Okay.

1:45:33.458 --> 1:45:35.627
-Let's start running.
-Yeah, run. Run.

1:45:45.095 --> 1:45:47.472
Once I give you the signal for air,

1:45:48.182 --> 1:45:50.893
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1:45:50.976 --> 1:45:52.144
When the engine starts,

1:45:52.227 --> 1:45:54.730
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1:45:54.813 --> 1:45:56.481
-You understand?
-Yeah.

1:45:58.650 --> 1:45:59.651
Yes!

1:46:01.528 --> 1:46:03.697
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1:46:11.622 --> 1:46:13.665
Okay. Wow.

1:46:14.833 --> 1:46:16.668
It's been a minute, huh, Mav?

1:46:45.531 --> 1:46:48.492
Oh, my God. This thing is so old.

1:46:49.493 --> 1:46:50.494
All right.

1:46:55.582 --> 1:46:57.125
-Canopy?
-Clear.

1:47:15.352 --> 1:47:17.229
Both runways are cratered.

1:47:17.938 --> 1:47:20.023
How we gonna get this museum piece
in the air?

1:47:30.409 --> 1:47:31.827
Why are the wings coming out, Mav?

1:47:38.500 --> 1:47:41.211
Mav, this is a taxiway, not a runway.

1:47:41.795 --> 1:47:44.715
This is a very short taxiway, Mav.

1:47:44.798 --> 1:47:46.008
Just hang on.

1:47:47.342 --> 1:47:48.719
Holy shit!

1:47:54.766 --> 1:47:56.059
Come on, come on, come on.

1:47:56.143 --> 1:47:57.186
Needle's alive.

1:48:00.606 --> 1:48:02.858
-Mav?
-That's it. Come on, come on!

1:48:02.941 --> 1:48:03.984
All right.

1:48:04.902 --> 1:48:06.904
-Mav!
-Here we go.

1:48:08.363 --> 1:48:09.781
Holy shit.

1:48:23.545 --> 1:48:26.632
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from Rooster's ESAT.

1:48:26.715 --> 1:48:28.634
But there seems to be a malfunction.

1:48:28.717 --> 1:48:30.052
-Have you lost him?
-No, sir.

1:48:31.053 --> 1:48:32.513
He's supersonic.

1:48:33.138 --> 1:48:34.223
He's airborne.

1:48:35.474 --> 1:48:37.059
-In what?
-Sir.

1:48:37.768 --> 1:48:42.022
Overwatch reports an F-14 Tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1:48:42.940 --> 1:48:45.484
Can't be. It can't be!

1:48:47.194 --> 1:48:48.195
Maverick.

1:48:50.447 --> 1:48:52.783
Okay, Rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1:48:52.866 --> 1:48:54.326
I'm working on it.

1:48:54.409 --> 1:48:57.829
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1:48:58.497 --> 1:49:00.874
-What do I do? Talk me through it.
-Okay, first the radio.

1:49:00.958 --> 1:49:02.125
Throw the…

1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:05.170
the UHF-2 circuit breaker.

1:49:05.254 --> 1:49:06.255
Try that.

1:49:06.839 --> 1:49:09.299
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1:49:09.383 --> 1:49:11.343
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1:49:11.426 --> 1:49:12.886
I'll figure it out.

1:49:16.223 --> 1:49:18.225
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1:49:23.730 --> 1:49:24.857
What do we do?

1:49:25.524 --> 1:49:27.651
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1:49:27.734 --> 1:49:29.695
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1:49:32.072 --> 1:49:34.032
Well, here they come.

1:49:34.700 --> 1:49:37.202
-What's your plan?
-Just put your mask on.

1:49:38.453 --> 1:49:40.789
Remember, we're on the same team.

1:49:43.500 --> 1:49:45.294
Just wave and smile.

1:49:45.919 --> 1:49:47.546
Just wave and smile.

1:49:54.678 --> 1:49:56.471
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1:49:56.555 --> 1:49:59.433
No idea. I have no idea what he's saying.

1:50:00.309 --> 1:50:03.687
-What about that one? Any idea?
-No, never seen that one either.

1:50:07.024 --> 1:50:10.819
Oh, shit. His wingman is moving
into weapons envelope.

1:50:11.653 --> 1:50:13.197
All right, listen up.

1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:15.991
When I tell you,
you grab those rings above your head.

1:50:16.074 --> 1:50:17.659
That's the ejection handle.

1:50:18.744 --> 1:50:20.913
Mav, can we outrun these guys?

1:50:21.580 --> 1:50:23.290
Not their missiles and guns.

1:50:28.295 --> 1:50:29.671
Then it's a dogfight.

1:50:30.380 --> 1:50:33.217
An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:36.970
It's not the plane, it's the pilot.

1:50:38.555 --> 1:50:40.516
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.

1:50:41.183 --> 1:50:42.851
But you are here.

1:50:43.644 --> 1:50:44.978
Come on, Mav.

1:50:46.104 --> 1:50:47.272
Don't think.

1:50:48.565 --> 1:50:49.608
Just do.

1:51:05.249 --> 1:51:07.209
Tell me when you see smoke in the air.

1:51:11.588 --> 1:51:13.674
-Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!
-Hang on.

1:51:16.510 --> 1:51:19.012
Yeah, Mav! Splash one! Splash one!

1:51:24.351 --> 1:51:25.561
Here comes another one.

1:51:28.814 --> 1:51:30.858
Rooster, flares! Now, now, now!

1:51:34.278 --> 1:51:35.529
Splitting the throttles.

1:51:37.698 --> 1:51:38.824
Coming around.

1:51:43.161 --> 1:51:45.622
-Give me tone, give me tone.
-You got him, Mav! You got him!

1:51:45.706 --> 1:51:46.623
Taking the shot.

1:51:53.297 --> 1:51:54.548
What the--

1:51:55.549 --> 1:51:57.676
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

1:51:59.094 --> 1:52:01.346
Hang on. We got to get low.

1:52:01.430 --> 1:52:03.724
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1:52:05.851 --> 1:52:06.768
Here he comes!

1:52:19.573 --> 1:52:21.491
Talk to me, Rooster. Where is he?

1:52:21.575 --> 1:52:23.243
He's still on us!

1:52:30.417 --> 1:52:32.503
-We took a hit! We took a hit!
-Damn it!

1:52:37.591 --> 1:52:40.010
-Come on, Mav. Do some of that pilot shit.
-Brace yourself.

1:52:50.479 --> 1:52:51.522
Holy shit.

1:52:58.570 --> 1:53:00.405
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1:53:04.868 --> 1:53:06.119
Damn it!

1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:09.373
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1:53:15.712 --> 1:53:16.839
Come on, Mav, come on.

1:53:19.508 --> 1:53:21.134
-You got him, Mav!
-It's not over yet.

1:53:25.848 --> 1:53:27.683
-One last chance.
-You can do this.

1:53:28.851 --> 1:53:30.060
Come on, Maverick.

1:53:40.153 --> 1:53:42.072
Yes! Splash two!

1:53:53.125 --> 1:53:55.043
-Mav, I got the radio on.
-Outstanding.

1:53:55.127 --> 1:53:57.087
-Get us in touch with the boat.
-Copy that.

1:53:59.298 --> 1:54:00.507
Oh, my God.

1:54:02.509 --> 1:54:04.178
Where the hell is this guy?

1:54:05.512 --> 1:54:07.097
He's on our nose.

1:54:10.517 --> 1:54:11.727
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1:54:13.854 --> 1:54:16.190
Smoke in the air! Rooster, flares!

1:54:18.734 --> 1:54:20.027
That was close.

1:54:22.487 --> 1:54:24.406
We're out of flares, Mav.

1:54:28.619 --> 1:54:30.579
Shit, he's already on us.

1:54:35.417 --> 1:54:37.127
This is not good.

1:54:45.302 --> 1:54:47.262
-We took another hit!
-No, no, no!

1:54:52.059 --> 1:54:54.353
We can't take much more of this.

1:54:54.436 --> 1:54:56.188
We can't outrun this guy. We got to eject.

1:54:56.271 --> 1:54:57.523
-What?
-We need altitude.

1:54:57.606 --> 1:54:59.316
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1:54:59.399 --> 1:55:01.860
-Mav, wait!
-Rooster, there's no other way.

1:55:05.113 --> 1:55:06.698
Eject, eject, eject!

1:55:07.533 --> 1:55:09.576
Rooster, pull the handle! Eject!

1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:11.245
It's not working.

1:55:21.922 --> 1:55:23.257
Mav!

1:55:25.592 --> 1:55:26.927
I'm sorry.

1:55:28.428 --> 1:55:29.930
I'm sorry, Goose.

1:55:42.651 --> 1:55:46.655
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your savior speaking.

1:55:46.738 --> 1:55:48.282
Please fasten your seat belts,

1:55:48.365 --> 1:55:51.410
return your tray tables
to their locked and upright positions

1:55:52.369 --> 1:55:54.621
and prepare for landing.

1:55:56.957 --> 1:55:59.209
Hey, Hangman, you look good.

1:55:59.293 --> 1:56:02.629
I am good, Rooster. I'm very good.

1:56:04.506 --> 1:56:06.216
I'll see you back on deck.

1:56:28.113 --> 1:56:29.573
Maverick is downwind.

1:56:29.656 --> 1:56:33.118
No front landing gear. No tailhook.
Pull the cable and raise the barricade.

1:56:33.202 --> 1:56:35.287
Foul deck! Raise the barricade!

1:56:36.371 --> 1:56:37.748
Go!

1:57:00.270 --> 1:57:02.397
Please don't tell me we lost an engine.

1:57:02.481 --> 1:57:05.108
-All right, I won't tell you that.
-Okay.

1:57:28.882 --> 1:57:29.800
You good?

1:57:30.551 --> 1:57:32.219
Yeah. I'm good.

1:58:17.890 --> 1:58:20.392
-Chalked yourself another kill.
-That makes two.

1:58:21.143 --> 1:58:23.937
Mav has five. Makes him an ace.

1:58:42.164 --> 1:58:44.333
Captain Mitchell! Captain Mitchell!

1:58:51.173 --> 1:58:52.424
Sir.

1:59:00.015 --> 1:59:01.642
Thank you for saving my life.

1:59:03.060 --> 1:59:04.937
It's what my dad would've done.

1:59:44.184 --> 1:59:45.185
Hey, Mav.

1:59:46.270 --> 1:59:47.354
Jimmy.

1:59:48.564 --> 1:59:49.565
Is…

1:59:50.482 --> 1:59:51.984
Is Penny around?

1:59:52.067 --> 1:59:55.320
She took Amelia on a sailing trip.

1:59:57.906 --> 2:00:00.158
Did she say when she'd be back?

2:00:00.242 --> 2:00:01.743
You know, she didn't.

2:00:04.079 --> 2:00:05.747
Can I get you anything?

2:00:19.178 --> 2:00:20.095
Get in there.
