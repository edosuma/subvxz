WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:07.173
(sniffling)

00:07.215 --> 00:08.383
(sobs)

00:08.425 --> 00:10.176
(blows nose)

00:10.218 --> 00:12.012
(moans)

00:12.053 --> 00:14.389
Thank you for staying over.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.979
It's gonna get better.
Don't see how.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.189
Is the earth gonna open
up and swallow me whole,

00:23.231 --> 00:25.567
make me forget that
Aunt Diana exiled me

00:25.608 --> 00:27.736
from the only family
that I ever had?

00:27.777 --> 00:29.112
(phone chimes)

00:29.154 --> 00:30.905
Oh, that sound.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.825
That's what it sounded like
when the Marvins texted me.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.870
Nancy needs us at The Claw.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.873
No, you go ahead.
I'll catch up.

00:39.914 --> 00:43.668
Just gonna lie down
for a bit longer.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.503
(crying)

00:51.426 --> 00:53.136
(as Odette, French accent):
Blech.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.975
You again.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.853
Odette Lamar.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.356
I've been
waiting for you.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.233
Wondering when
we might meet.

01:07.275 --> 01:10.528
Go away, Nicolas.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.155
(chuckles):
Uh, no.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.074
Uh, no, it's not,
it's not "Nicolas,"

01:14.115 --> 01:16.868
and I-I'm not going
anywhere, okay?

01:16.910 --> 01:18.286
We need to talk.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.914
No, we don't.
I hear you talk.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.124
changed?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.710
What kind of love affair
can this be for you?

01:25.752 --> 01:29.380
I give you permission
to au revoir.

01:29.422 --> 01:32.342
No. I'm not au revoir-ing.
(phone vibrating)

01:32.383 --> 01:33.635
You are.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.429
Odette.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.723
Hey, will you talk to me?

01:42.685 --> 01:45.021
(normal voice):
Nick, what are you...

01:45.063 --> 01:46.564
What is going on?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.233
Why are you out of bed?

01:48.274 --> 01:50.527
Um...

01:50.568 --> 01:53.655
Uh, uh, it's...
(clears throat)

01:53.696 --> 01:56.658
We... we had a
visit from Odette.

01:56.699 --> 01:58.701
Oh, that bitch.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.286
(phone vibrating)

02:00.328 --> 02:01.913
I'm sorry,
I have to take this.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.290
I've got, like, a hundred
missed calls from Nancy.

02:06.584 --> 02:08.169
Yes?

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
George.

02:10.213 --> 02:14.008
I think we're in trouble.

02:14.050 --> 02:15.802
Someone broke into our lockers
at The Claw.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.054
I've been looking
for hours, but...

02:19.055 --> 02:20.140
(exhales)

02:20.181 --> 02:21.266
(phone beeps)

02:21.307 --> 02:23.810
The shroud is gone.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.979
The shroud?

02:26.020 --> 02:26.646
Wait, the...

02:28.690 --> 02:32.110
The shroud that kills you
if it's ever used again?

02:32.152 --> 02:33.945
That shroud?

02:33.987 --> 02:37.073
That is the one.
Someone stole it.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.618
♪ ♪

02:53.089 --> 02:55.300
They came in here
and broke into all the lockers.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.343
One was picked,
the rest were just bashed open,

02:57.385 --> 03:00.138
so we're looking
for an experienced thief...

03:01.139 --> 03:02.974
...with a short attention span.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.228
So this thing that could
kill you, it was...

03:07.270 --> 03:08.771
it was just in
your locker?

03:08.813 --> 03:10.315
It was locked in my locker.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.858
NICK:
Right. Oh, okay.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.318
But not in a bank

03:13.359 --> 03:15.028
or a safe or somewhere
that's actually...

03:15.069 --> 03:16.905
Hey, Ace,
Was anything else taken?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.282
They took a banana cream pie.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.492
Hey, forget
the pie, okay?

03:21.534 --> 03:23.161
How would someone even
know about the shroud?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.787
Not just what
it is but where.

03:24.829 --> 03:27.040
Yeah, that's the question,
because besides Bess,

03:27.081 --> 03:28.917
the only people who know that
are in this room.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.002
Yes?
I have not told anyone.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.129
Me, neither. Not a soul.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.011
NANCY:
Did you tell Amanda

03:40.053 --> 03:42.180
or not?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.182
It's hard to say.

03:45.558 --> 03:49.062
Something about her
just opens me up.

03:50.104 --> 03:52.023
Like a flower.
I'm... I'm in bloom.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.400
GEORGE:
Wow, Ace. I'm so happy for you.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.194
You've got a crush
and now I'm gonna die.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.613
Ace? Wake up.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.908
Gil's probably offering it to
the highest bidder as we speak.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.160
Nick, you don't know Amanda.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.537
She would never betray
my confidence like that.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.417
(insects buzzing,
dogs barking in distance)

04:12.877 --> 04:17.298
NANCY: (exhales) Okay, our only
goal here is to get the shroud.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.967
So we're gonna give him an out.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.551
Okay, all carrot, no stick.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.886
Got it.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.474
(chuckles)
Nancy Drew.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.435
And friends.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.814
Hmm. What, uh, what brings you
to Bobbsey Manor?

04:32.855 --> 04:34.774
There was a break-in
at The Claw last night.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.860
An antique-- I guess you could
call it a shroud-- was taken.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.279
Where is it, Bobbsey?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.114
NANCY:
Gil, we know
you sometimes freelance

04:41.155 --> 04:44.784
in the lost valuables
and antiques space.

04:45.827 --> 04:48.705
Maybe you, uh, came across
our shroud in your travels.

04:48.746 --> 04:51.457
Yeah, no, uh,
wish I could help.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.584
Do you have any leads on
the burglary, though, or...?

04:53.626 --> 04:55.920
Yeah. Yeah,
they're all over your shirt.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.047
Those crumbs?
That's pie crust.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.342
(clears throat)
Uh, whoa, whoa. Hey. Uh...

05:02.885 --> 05:04.262
Oh! Banana cream.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.805
From The Bayside Claw.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.810
Hey, manager,
Hendersons' disposal's

05:10.852 --> 05:12.979
clogged again, and you...

05:13.021 --> 05:14.397
Hi...

05:14.439 --> 05:16.941
Ace.
(chuckles)
Hey, Amanda.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.610
Amanda. Hi. Uh...

05:19.652 --> 05:21.404
Why don't you go take a swing
at Henderson's disposal?

05:21.446 --> 05:23.031
Hmm?
I fixed it last time.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.574
ACE:
I know my way
around a disposal.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.367
I could lend you an
extra hand if you want.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.037
She doesn't.
I'd love that.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.003
What?
We know you took
the shroud, Gil.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.547
If it's about money,
just name a price.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.965
No price.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.801
All right? It's not for sale.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.766
Our mom was murdered
14 years ago.

05:49.807 --> 05:51.934
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.604
GEORGE:
The shroud won't
bring her back, Gil.

05:54.645 --> 05:56.064
It won't revive someone
who's been dead

05:56.105 --> 05:57.440
for longer than
an hour or two.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.941
Yeah, I know.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.360
But it will tell me
what happened to her.

06:00.401 --> 06:03.946
How?
Her body was never
found, no arrest was

06:03.988 --> 06:07.325
ever made,
but I-I know who did it.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.910
Eddie Collins.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.370
All right?
He's-he's the old creep

06:10.411 --> 06:11.704
that lives
on top of Pulpit Hill.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.705
Tell the police.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.165
Oh, come on.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.875
They wouldn't build a case
against him then,

06:15.917 --> 06:17.460
they're not gonna do it now
when he's about to die.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.545
Brain aneurysm.

06:19.587 --> 06:24.050
He's in a coma, and word is
they're about to pull the plug.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.259
Tonight.

06:25.301 --> 06:26.761
That's why
you took the shroud,

06:26.803 --> 06:28.638
'cause you're gonna
revive Eddie Collins.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.516
And to make him
tell me what he did.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.017
I want answers.

06:34.644 --> 06:38.022
Hey, do you know what happens
if you use that shroud?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.360
NICK:
Oh, he knows.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.112
He knows.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.280
You think I'm
playing, huh?

06:46.322 --> 06:47.990
I will tear this
place apart.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.700
And you still
won't find it.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.161
Do you trust me?

06:52.203 --> 06:54.705
Why? But also, yes.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.915
Gil?

06:55.957 --> 06:57.417
If I can get you
those answers

06:57.458 --> 06:59.585
before Eddie dies,
will you give the shroud back?

06:59.627 --> 07:01.629
No, no, no. No, no, no.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.881
We-we are not
negotiating.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.425
Will you?

07:06.467 --> 07:09.429
(exhales) You have until 6:00.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.932
Hey, Eddie Collins
knows the truth.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.059
I won't let it die with him.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.610
Carson is gonna file
an amicus brief to try

07:24.652 --> 07:26.612
and get the judge to delay
termination of life support.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.614
Okay, so the plan is
you-you distract Gil

07:28.656 --> 07:30.199
trying to solve
his mom's murder

07:30.241 --> 07:32.368
and then we toss his place
and find the shroud?

07:32.410 --> 07:33.786
It's not there, Nick.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.371
Then we dangle
him from the roof

07:35.413 --> 07:36.873
until he tells us
where it is.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.208
No, the-the plan is, uh,
solve his mom's murder

07:39.250 --> 07:40.626
and get the shroud back.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.336
What, by 6:00 p.m.?

07:42.378 --> 07:45.047
A case that hasn't been
solved for, what, 14 years?

07:45.089 --> 07:48.050
And what if you don't? Huh?
W-What happens to George?

07:48.092 --> 07:50.052
I'm not going to let
anything happen to George.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.722
Okay, can George weigh in?

07:52.763 --> 07:55.016
I want to go with Nancy's plan.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.396
I'm gonna go text Ace, see if
he got anything out of Amanda.

08:01.397 --> 08:03.024
Okay.

08:06.402 --> 08:07.904
(grunting)

08:09.071 --> 08:10.573
(groans)

08:10.615 --> 08:12.492
(door opens, Bess gasps)

08:12.533 --> 08:15.286
Yes, Your Honor,
a motion for injunction.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.913
I'm writing it up now.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.206
(Bess whimpers)

08:18.247 --> 08:20.458
Bess?
Mr. Drew. I'm sorry.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.793
I-I scared you. Um...

08:23.920 --> 08:25.087
I should go.

08:25.129 --> 08:26.506
No, no, no, no, no.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.841
It's fine. I just
didn't realize anyone was...

08:28.883 --> 08:30.510
I'm picking up
case law books

08:30.551 --> 08:34.388
for this injunction, and then
I will be out of your...

08:36.140 --> 08:38.059
(crying softly)

08:41.270 --> 08:43.439
Are you all right?
(sniffles)

08:43.481 --> 08:47.026
I'm just having a real hard time
getting going this morning.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.569
You know?

08:50.029 --> 08:51.489
(phone chimes)

08:54.408 --> 08:56.911
And now they've taken
me off the group chat.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.996
Great. Why? So they
can talk about me?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.414
(laughs)
You know?

09:00.456 --> 09:02.792
(phone thuds)
(moans)

09:03.960 --> 09:05.336
You know what?

09:05.378 --> 09:07.880
I may work from here today.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.423
Okay.

09:09.465 --> 09:12.426
So I'll be in my office
if you need anything.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.315
(chip crunches)

09:26.357 --> 09:29.193
(Bess crying)

09:29.235 --> 09:31.195
(thunder rumbling)

09:31.237 --> 09:32.989
AMANDA:
That should do it.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.996
I didn't tell Gil
where the shroud is.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.417
Jackass reads my texts.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.587
(chuckles) He's got
no boundaries.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.422
Thinks he's
protecting me,

09:49.463 --> 09:52.216
even though he was born
two minutes after me.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.886
Get him to give us
the shroud back.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.056
I don't think I can.

10:00.474 --> 10:03.394
Gil goes dark sometimes.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.981
My mom's murder,
all the questions...

10:08.441 --> 10:10.401
Tell me about your mom.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.155
Dad was doing
six months in county.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.366
So it was just me,
uh, Amanda and Mom.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.118
(thunder rumbling)

10:19.160 --> 10:21.120
You know, it was like
summer camp all year,

10:21.162 --> 10:22.747
'cause our mom was, uh...

10:22.788 --> 10:25.583
Mercurial is what Rosemary was.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.003
Um... she was fun to be around.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.339
Didn't always remember
to buy us shoes.

10:31.380 --> 10:34.800
She'd drop us off at school,
hike these trails all day,

10:34.842 --> 10:37.428
and be back to pick us up.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.475
Until the day she wasn't.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.144
The police found evidence
of a struggle in the woods,

10:45.186 --> 10:47.480
and a witness said
that they saw her

10:47.521 --> 10:49.774
arguing with
some weird older dude.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.188
BESS:
Oh, and another thing.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.773
You should cut
that last line out.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.733
I-It steps on
your big finish.

25:26.775 --> 25:29.027
Good. Good.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.071
This is really good.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.782
I buttered both sides
of the bread.
Mmm.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.076
I'm really happy
to see you feeling better.

25:36.117 --> 25:39.246
I am feeling better. Mmm.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.086
There was no hearing, was there?

25:46.127 --> 25:47.754
(chuckles softly)

25:47.796 --> 25:49.506
No.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.511
The judge denied
the hearing.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.846
He's going to rule
on my written motion instead,

25:56.888 --> 25:58.348
and I filed that
this morning.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.933
Hmm.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.727
So, your opening
statement? You...

26:02.769 --> 26:06.314
Bess, I would have taken
every single note of yours.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.941
You are really good
at this.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.569
Yeah, but it was a
trick. (chuckles)

26:10.610 --> 26:11.695
No.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.239
A nudge.

26:14.281 --> 26:17.492
I wanted to give you
something else to think about.
(scoffs)

26:17.534 --> 26:21.538
Something besides
how I've lost everything?

26:22.497 --> 26:25.792
Well, it can be really hard

26:25.834 --> 26:29.546
to figure out your next step
when things get overwhelming.

26:30.505 --> 26:32.132
How are you doing?

26:32.173 --> 26:35.010
(chuckles softly)
It's been scary.

26:36.469 --> 26:39.014
But also freeing.
Yeah.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.099
I don't have to...

26:41.141 --> 26:43.435
worry about keeping
my story straight

26:43.476 --> 26:46.104
every time I talk to Nancy
about the past.

26:46.146 --> 26:49.774
For the first time
since she was born, I'm just...

26:50.942 --> 26:52.402
...me.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.988
Without any secrets.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.033
Guess that makes two of us.

26:58.074 --> 27:01.453
Although I'm just me
without any hope.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.040
You know...

27:05.081 --> 27:08.209
I saw this documentary once
about spider monkeys.

27:08.251 --> 27:11.504
Flying through the jungle
from vine to vine.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.757
And they're incredible.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.134
There's always this moment

27:16.176 --> 27:18.803
after they've let go
of the last vine

27:18.845 --> 27:21.097
before they grab
onto the next one.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.559
And they don't falter.
They don't look down.

27:24.601 --> 27:27.646
They just go on faith

27:27.687 --> 27:29.856
that the next vine
will be there.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.484
Right.

27:32.525 --> 27:35.612
The next vine
will be there, Bess.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.866
Have faith.

27:39.908 --> 27:42.202
(chuckles softly)

27:43.119 --> 27:45.121
BESS:
How can they sell you

27:45.163 --> 27:46.706
a piece of art without
giving you the artist name?

27:46.748 --> 27:49.376
It's Unknown? There could be
a million Unknowns.

27:49.417 --> 27:50.752
ACE:
Well, technically,
they sold it

27:50.794 --> 27:52.379
to Nick.
What?

27:52.420 --> 27:54.506
This Unknown has a signature.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.508
Upper left.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.259
Yeah, those numbers.

27:58.301 --> 28:00.720
5962.
NANCY:
The same numbers

28:00.762 --> 28:03.348
that were on the paintings
in Collins' basement.

28:03.390 --> 28:06.476
GEORGE:
Hey, I swear I've
seen those before.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.270
Yeah, we both have.
The baby book.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.733
You got yourself a deal
on this art.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.236
Two for the price of one.
Check it out.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.363
Look.

28:23.284 --> 28:26.246
Hey, there's a
painting underneath.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.419
NANCY:
That's Rosemary Bobbsey.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.840
But, like,

28:36.881 --> 28:39.801
14 years older.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.431
How she'd look today.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.974
(phone vibrates)

28:46.015 --> 28:47.434
Hey.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.561
CARSON:
I just heard from the judge.

28:49.602 --> 28:51.521
He's not going to rule
on my motion.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.231
What? Why?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.651
(sighs)

28:58.486 --> 29:01.406
Eddie Collins just died.
His body gave out.

29:01.448 --> 29:04.617
Couldn't wait until 6:00.
We got to find Gil.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.168
♪ ♪

29:29.809 --> 29:32.103
I'm not gonna let you
do this, Gil.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.813
The clock started.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.483
I'm doing this
before the coroner gets here.

29:36.524 --> 29:39.694
Eddie Collins didn't
kill her, Gil.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.031
Those paintings
are self-portraits.

29:43.072 --> 29:45.700
They have her signature.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.622
5962 is not a signature.
It is.

29:50.663 --> 29:53.666
Five pounds, nine ounces.
Six pounds, two ounces.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.127
Those are your birth weights.
Amanda's and yours.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.630
As recorded in
your baby book.

29:58.671 --> 30:01.257
Okay. So, she was a painter.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.550
He still killed her.

30:02.592 --> 30:04.385
a painter.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.638
She's still alive.

30:06.679 --> 30:09.224
(breathing shakily)
Where is he?

30:09.265 --> 30:12.852
He's halfway to a morgue
in Bangor.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.522
You're never gonna
get there in time.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.898
The shroud won't work.
(grunts)

30:16.940 --> 30:19.067
(breathing heavily)

30:20.026 --> 30:21.694
You-you tricked me.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.989
She saved you.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.825
Mom's alive.

30:26.866 --> 30:29.160
What, now-now y-you believe her?

30:29.202 --> 30:30.495
Huh?

30:30.537 --> 30:32.747
We were six years old.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.249
Why would Mom leave us?

30:34.290 --> 30:35.959
She was sick, Gil.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.503
Mom was being treated for
psychiatric delusions.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.589
We found
her medical records.

30:41.631 --> 30:43.967
She thought she was being
haunted by a monster.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.594
A-A Burning Thing.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.012
NANCY:
It was in her paintings.

30:48.054 --> 30:49.889
It was carved into
a tree in the woods.

30:49.931 --> 30:52.725
She met Eddie
in group therapy.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.144
She confided in him
that painting is the only thing

30:55.186 --> 30:57.981
that eased her fear,
so he let her paint here.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.525
AMANDA:
Mom made Eddie
promise not to tell.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.902
She didn't want
to scare us.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.696
Read her medical reports.
No, no, no.

31:04.737 --> 31:07.615
No. No.
No one can tell us the truth

31:07.657 --> 31:09.200
except for Eddie Collins,

31:09.242 --> 31:11.202
who is now dead.
No, Gil.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.246
I can tell you.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.918
This is the one
thing of Mom's

31:18.960 --> 31:20.837
that I held onto.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.923
I had forgotten about it
until I saw that painting.

31:23.965 --> 31:25.341
I must have been four.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.343
I went into her room
because I couldn't sleep.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.470
I was afraid there was
monsters under my bed,

31:29.512 --> 31:31.264
and she drew that for me.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.725
She said this is the only
monster I should be afraid of,

31:33.766 --> 31:37.103
but promised to make sure
it never found us.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.356
(breath trembles)

31:40.398 --> 31:42.442
Why-Why'd she tell you
but not me?

31:42.483 --> 31:44.152
Who knows?

31:44.193 --> 31:47.655
Maybe because she didn't
want to frighten you.

31:49.365 --> 31:53.077
Or maybe it's because
I'm two minutes older than you,

31:53.119 --> 31:56.372
and it's my job
to look out for you.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.584
Always.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.922
Give the shroud back, Gil.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.177

32:09.218 --> 32:11.304

BESS:
Yeah.
