00:36.476 --> 00:38.386
<i>Previously on</i> "The Affair"...

00:38.463 --> 00:40.931
She seemed like the
loneliest girl in the world.

00:41.246 --> 00:43.204
You know,
some days, I-I'm proud

00:43.281 --> 00:44.912
of the life that I've built.

00:44.989 --> 00:47.040
And then, sometimes,
it just feels

00:47.080 --> 00:49.113
like a giant charade,
and this is all a joke

00:49.181 --> 00:50.408
I've been playing on myself,

00:50.485 --> 00:53.206
this life that I
am trying to live.

00:53.283 --> 00:55.042
Go home to your fucking wife.

01:01.199 --> 01:03.324
They found her body.

01:03.401 --> 01:05.646
She drowned herself.

01:05.723 --> 01:07.550
I saw her,
and she was pretty beat up.

01:07.627 --> 01:09.669
- She had... her head was...
- Lacerations.

01:09.746 --> 01:11.107
Right, all consistent
with striking

01:11.175 --> 01:12.795
- against these rocks.
- What about Ben?

01:12.863 --> 01:14.496
He has an alibi.
It checks out.

01:14.573 --> 01:16.036
- What did you say to her?
- I don't know

01:16.104 --> 01:17.207
what the fuck you're asking.

01:17.284 --> 01:18.505
I'm asking you what you said

01:18.573 --> 01:20.079
that made her want
to kill herself.

01:20.156 --> 01:22.116
Why don't you take a look
in the fucking mirror!

01:22.193 --> 01:23.949
- Why didn't you do something?!
- Stop it!

01:24.026 --> 01:25.825
You had her in your hands,

01:25.902 --> 01:28.131
and you let her go. Why?

01:28.281 --> 01:30.253
I took a pregnancy
test this morning.

01:30.330 --> 01:32.579
You're entering
menopause, Helen.

01:32.656 --> 01:34.533
Don't you think I'm too young
to be in menopause?

01:34.610 --> 01:36.116
Don't you think
I'm too young to die?

01:36.193 --> 01:37.394
Where you going?

01:37.471 --> 01:38.722
To my women's moon circle.

01:38.799 --> 01:39.848
I invited you.

01:39.916 --> 01:40.995
I just had this intuition

01:41.072 --> 01:42.616
that you really
needed some guidance.

01:42.693 --> 01:45.124
I fucked a married man.

01:45.426 --> 01:48.581
I really like his wife, so...
it was a stupid thing to do.

01:48.658 --> 01:50.788
I wish I had your life.

01:50.865 --> 01:52.386
I mean, you have a whole world

01:52.463 --> 01:54.967
that literally couldn't
live without you.

01:55.086 --> 01:57.352
I'm feeling like Vik
isn't listening to me.

01:57.429 --> 01:59.923
I'm feeling like I want him
to get treatment.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.445
What he needs you for,
the one thing

02:01.522 --> 02:03.002
you can give him
that no one else

02:03.079 --> 02:05.225
in the world can,
is your love.

02:05.481 --> 02:06.615
Helen.

02:06.698 --> 02:08.217
I don't want you to die.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.202
I don't want to die, either.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.489
Surprised?

04:41.976 --> 04:43.201
- You ready?
- Yeah.

04:43.278 --> 04:44.853
Let's do this.

04:45.498 --> 04:47.072
Okay!

04:47.149 --> 04:49.064
Good morning,
good morning.

04:50.601 --> 04:51.938
So...

04:52.015 --> 04:54.037
in a move designed

04:54.114 --> 04:57.329
to keep you all on
the very tips of your toes,

04:57.406 --> 04:59.449
I read your stories
from last week

04:59.526 --> 05:02.720
in an uncharacteristically
timely fashion.

05:03.702 --> 05:06.267
Some were very,
very good,

05:06.344 --> 05:09.071
while others...
well, all I can say is

05:09.148 --> 05:10.826
I hope the rest of
your classes are going well.

05:10.903 --> 05:12.836
But before we commence,

05:12.913 --> 05:14.522
let me call
your attention

05:14.599 --> 05:16.462
to our special guest.

05:17.031 --> 05:19.037
This gentlemen here is...

05:19.114 --> 05:20.666
Noah fucking Solloway.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.217
Noah fucking
Solloway, indeed.

05:24.294 --> 05:27.032
The man wholly responsible
for the fact that I smoked

05:27.109 --> 05:29.217
Parliament Lights
for nearly two decades

05:29.294 --> 05:32.178
because in college he made it
look so tragically cool.

05:32.255 --> 05:35.485
Mr. Solloway, can I just
fanboy out for a second?

05:35.613 --> 05:39.071
I mean, you're the reason
why I became a writer.

05:39.264 --> 05:40.617
I'm happy to hear it.

05:40.694 --> 05:43.315
- I love the way you write women.
- You do?

05:43.392 --> 05:46.492
Alana's my favorite, like,
contemporary character.

05:46.569 --> 05:48.310
When she gives that speech
at the end of Descent

05:48.387 --> 05:51.685
about feeling like a figment
of other people's imagination...

05:51.753 --> 05:52.786
how'd you know that?

05:52.863 --> 05:54.555
Yeah, seriously.

05:54.865 --> 05:57.843
Uh, well, to be honest,
writing character

05:57.920 --> 05:59.491
is all about
listening to people.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.162
And, uh, the place
I really learned to listen

06:02.239 --> 06:03.875
was in a seminar
like this one

06:03.952 --> 06:05.408
a million years ago,

06:05.485 --> 06:07.688
with Ariel
sitting next to me.

06:08.740 --> 06:11.989
Noah has with him today
a prospective student.

06:12.066 --> 06:14.735
Uh, guys, this is Antony.

06:14.823 --> 06:16.239
Anton.

06:16.654 --> 06:18.318
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

06:18.395 --> 06:19.663
No, it's fine.

06:19.740 --> 06:21.807
You can call me Antony
if you want.

06:23.045 --> 06:25.405
Anton is
visiting from L.A.

06:25.482 --> 06:26.965
Where else you looking, bro?

06:27.042 --> 06:28.734
Um, just here, actually.

06:28.811 --> 06:30.450
Couple state colleges
in California.

06:30.527 --> 06:32.792
I'm from Chicago,
South Side.

06:32.912 --> 06:34.140
We should talk
after class.

06:34.217 --> 06:35.575
We shall, man.
That'd be cool.

06:35.652 --> 06:37.658
Before he
entirely turns you off,

06:37.735 --> 06:39.289
this place isn't so bad.

06:39.389 --> 06:40.450
It's pretty woke.

06:40.527 --> 06:41.907
My God, Gabby.

06:41.984 --> 06:43.342
What?

06:43.580 --> 06:46.577
We have a residential college
named for a segregationist.

06:46.654 --> 06:48.062
And the School
of Public Policy.

06:48.139 --> 06:49.313
Yeah, but we fought
like hell

06:49.381 --> 06:50.547
- to get his name removed.
- We didn't win.

06:50.615 --> 06:53.144
- We got the mural taken down.
- Oh, the mural. What a win.

06:53.221 --> 06:55.193
Oh, hey. I didn't see you
at the protest, Zac.

06:55.270 --> 06:56.841
I had rehearsal.

06:56.918 --> 06:58.851
It's cool, guys.

06:58.928 --> 07:00.883
I actually really like it here.

07:02.483 --> 07:05.224
Okay, so then let's get going.

07:05.301 --> 07:07.945
May our pens be our swords.

07:08.022 --> 07:11.430
Today's prompt
is a quote from Whitman.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.790
This one's for you.

07:15.108 --> 07:18.125
"Do I contradict myself?

07:18.553 --> 07:19.958
Very well, then.

07:20.248 --> 07:22.875
I contradict myself.

07:23.123 --> 07:24.666
I am large.

07:24.834 --> 07:27.586
I contain multitudes."

07:27.865 --> 07:29.408
Write a character sketch

07:29.485 --> 07:31.700
of a person who has
a contradiction.

07:31.777 --> 07:32.906
A paradox.

07:32.989 --> 07:34.568
Show, don't tell.

07:34.645 --> 07:37.938
You have 15 minutes.

07:39.364 --> 07:40.575
Uh, can I borrow a couple

07:40.652 --> 07:42.032
- pieces of paper?
- Mm-hmm.

07:42.109 --> 07:44.326
Thank you.

07:47.390 --> 07:49.102
How you holding up?

07:52.645 --> 07:54.430
How's Joanie?

07:56.623 --> 07:58.239
Yeah.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.422
I don't know what
you tell her, either.

08:02.615 --> 08:03.740
Me?

08:04.239 --> 08:05.954
Yeah. Sure.

08:06.031 --> 08:07.493
No, I'd love to.

08:08.233 --> 08:09.575
I don't know.
I'll think about it.

08:09.652 --> 08:11.825
Maybe something
from a book she loved.

08:11.902 --> 08:13.211
Yeah.

08:13.416 --> 08:15.503
Okay, is there
anything else you need?

08:16.031 --> 08:18.124
I'll be there tomorrow morning.

08:18.383 --> 08:20.166
Uh, he's great.
He's, uh...

08:20.243 --> 08:21.283
I think he likes it here.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.031
Yeah.

08:23.438 --> 08:25.583
Will do. You, too.

08:29.903 --> 08:30.903
Oh.

08:31.430 --> 08:32.870
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

08:35.054 --> 08:37.648
Damn, Hoffman.
Leaves of Grass.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.120
Diving deep.

08:41.764 --> 08:43.250
Thank you for this.

08:43.530 --> 08:44.698
Stop. Are you kidding?

08:44.775 --> 08:46.745
I was thrilled
to hear from you.

08:46.882 --> 08:48.622
What's it been,
20 years?

08:48.699 --> 08:49.995
No. Can't be.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.166
I was at your last
book party.

08:52.373 --> 08:53.820
- You were?
- Yeah.

08:53.897 --> 08:55.073
Brooklyn Heights?

08:55.150 --> 08:57.921
The one about the sisters,
Siamese twins?

08:57.998 --> 08:59.427
That was three books ago.

08:59.504 --> 09:00.662
What?

09:00.865 --> 09:02.757
God, you were always
so prolific.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.575
You say it as if
it's a bad thing.

09:04.652 --> 09:06.203
It's not a bad thing.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.607
It's just emasculating.

09:07.684 --> 09:09.882
Uh, if I remember correctly,

09:09.959 --> 09:11.791
you're hard to emasculate.

09:14.495 --> 09:16.047
So, this is nice.

09:16.248 --> 09:18.405
What you're doing for this kid.

09:18.482 --> 09:21.575
Yeah, well, he's, you know...
he's... he's very talented.

09:21.652 --> 09:23.412
He just needs a...
a way in.

09:23.489 --> 09:24.916
- He's your student?
- Mm-hmm.

09:24.993 --> 09:26.197
Where?

09:26.405 --> 09:28.579
At a charter school
in South L.A.

09:28.656 --> 09:30.544
I didn't realize
you moved to California.

09:30.621 --> 09:32.430
When did that happen?

09:32.507 --> 09:35.861
Well, Helen's boyfriend
got a fancy job in L.A.,

09:35.938 --> 09:37.744
- so I...
- Wait. What?

09:38.146 --> 09:39.725
You guys split?

09:39.802 --> 09:41.988
- Yeah. You didn't know?
- When?

09:42.065 --> 09:44.810
Years ago. I mean, well,
it was in the news.

09:45.276 --> 09:46.682
You don't read the paper?

09:46.759 --> 09:48.155
Not if I can help it.

09:48.232 --> 09:49.682
I read novels mostly.

09:49.759 --> 09:51.074
Memoir, if pressed.

09:51.151 --> 09:53.124
You haven't changed at all.

09:53.557 --> 09:55.503
Wow.

09:55.979 --> 09:58.207
Noah and Helen.

09:58.643 --> 10:00.903
Requiescat in pace.

10:01.003 --> 10:02.322
Yeah. Thanks.

10:02.399 --> 10:04.747
I thought you guys
were gonna last forever.

10:04.862 --> 10:06.833
You were campus celebrities.

10:08.619 --> 10:10.363
Yeah, well...

10:10.440 --> 10:11.564
plans change.

10:11.641 --> 10:13.124
They really do.

10:13.557 --> 10:15.135
So, what happened?

10:15.212 --> 10:16.677
Was it her dad?

10:16.940 --> 10:18.536
You remember him?

10:18.854 --> 10:21.157
I remember that she thought
she kind of thought

10:21.234 --> 10:23.238
she was slumming it with you

10:23.315 --> 10:25.216
and you thought you found
your golden goose.

10:25.293 --> 10:26.397
Damn, Ariel.

10:26.474 --> 10:28.167
You really were
paying attention.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.801
Well, I had a crush.

10:33.286 --> 10:36.979
I spent most of college
waiting for an opening,

10:37.196 --> 10:40.089
but... it never came.

10:44.628 --> 10:46.763
I'd say you dodged a bullet.

10:47.656 --> 10:48.891
Yeah.

10:49.079 --> 10:51.823
Looking back,
I could have predicted that.

10:52.696 --> 10:54.559
I think you had the world
a little bit too much

10:54.636 --> 10:56.207
at your fingertips,
didn't you?

10:56.284 --> 10:57.412
Yeah, I was a...

10:57.489 --> 10:59.116
I was an asshole
for a long time, but...

10:59.193 --> 11:00.496
What about you?

11:00.573 --> 11:02.700
I mean, chair of
the English department.

11:02.777 --> 11:04.204
Multiple best sellers.

11:04.281 --> 11:06.207
Things worked out
pretty well.

11:06.415 --> 11:08.708
I had a cancer scare last year.

11:08.852 --> 11:11.370
I'm fine...
they cut it out... but...

11:11.969 --> 11:14.339
I am feeling
pretty lucky these days.

11:14.419 --> 11:16.638
I have this new boyfriend.

11:16.821 --> 11:18.678
He's a composer,
Brazilian.

11:18.746 --> 11:19.782
Hot.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.458
Yeah, right?

11:21.610 --> 11:23.008
Kids?

11:23.672 --> 11:24.813
No.

11:25.454 --> 11:26.971
Never had time.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.887
Biggest regret.

11:30.554 --> 11:31.804
You?

11:32.290 --> 11:34.074
Yeah. I've got
four of them.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.250
What?

11:35.399 --> 11:37.503
Jesus, Helen, nice work.

11:39.086 --> 11:43.628
Yeah, I don't see too much
of them, but I try.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.750
Did you ever remarry?

11:49.774 --> 11:51.332
Yeah, I did.

11:51.688 --> 11:53.016
Oh?

11:53.119 --> 11:54.546
Tell me about her.

11:54.682 --> 11:56.525
Well, she's, uh...

11:58.704 --> 12:00.596
She's dead.

12:01.030 --> 12:02.196
She died.

12:02.290 --> 12:03.964
Just a few days ago.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.489
Noah...

12:08.531 --> 12:11.291
Wh-What are you even doing here?

12:13.114 --> 12:15.931
Uh... what do you mean?

12:16.623 --> 12:19.218
Uh... are you okay?

12:19.295 --> 12:20.907
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm...

12:21.114 --> 12:24.891
I mean, I'm sad,
obviously, but, uh...

12:26.022 --> 12:27.623
I'm fine.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.928
Shall we?

12:36.448 --> 12:38.756
Okay, guys, that's time.

12:39.518 --> 12:40.893
So...

12:41.023 --> 12:42.944
Who wants
to start us off?

12:47.645 --> 12:49.864
Anton, how about you?

12:51.778 --> 12:53.414
You don't have to.

12:54.947 --> 12:56.499
Hey, I'll read.

12:57.896 --> 12:59.854
Yeah.

13:06.196 --> 13:07.615
Okay.

13:07.777 --> 13:09.482
Here goes.

13:11.787 --> 13:13.018
"You can tell
he used to be

13:13.095 --> 13:15.276
kind of cool
when he was younger.

13:15.740 --> 13:18.319
Something about the way
he wears his jeans.

13:18.396 --> 13:20.309
Or maybe it's the way
he carries himself

13:20.386 --> 13:21.984
with a certain swagger.

13:22.170 --> 13:23.780
Most of the teachers,

13:23.857 --> 13:25.750
they were there
because they had to be.

13:25.827 --> 13:27.516
And we knew that.

13:27.895 --> 13:29.233
But not him.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.958
He was a
big-time author.

13:31.107 --> 13:33.916
He was there because
he wanted to be.

13:34.162 --> 13:36.711
Because he cared
so much about us.

13:36.833 --> 13:39.273
Because he was
a good man.

13:40.193 --> 13:43.465
He'd wave George Orwell around
like they were peers

13:43.542 --> 13:44.887
and weep over Eliot.

13:44.964 --> 13:47.074
I had never seen
anybody cry

13:47.151 --> 13:48.870
over a poem before.

13:48.947 --> 13:51.324
I wanted to be just like him
when I grew up.

13:51.401 --> 13:54.041
So smart, so worldly.

13:55.698 --> 13:57.157
Wanted to have
that kind of grace

13:57.234 --> 13:59.195
resting on my shoulders.

13:59.396 --> 14:00.588
To move through the world

14:00.665 --> 14:02.945
like it was a woman
who belonged to me.

14:03.326 --> 14:05.375
We took a trip
together.

14:05.638 --> 14:09.000
He didn't have to do it,
but he offered.

14:09.373 --> 14:11.416
Because he believes in me.

14:11.576 --> 14:13.583
He believes in my future.

14:14.779 --> 14:16.742
Also, he's fucking my mother.

14:18.396 --> 14:21.207
But that doesn't matter,
because he cares.

14:21.334 --> 14:22.991
Look how he parts the seas

14:23.068 --> 14:26.258
for a boy like me
to walk right into Canaan.

14:26.607 --> 14:28.481
He's got kids
of his own, you know.

14:28.558 --> 14:30.477
He never really
talks about them.

14:30.554 --> 14:32.375
Makes you kind of
wonder why.

14:32.482 --> 14:33.825
Nothing affects him.

14:33.902 --> 14:37.583
Everything seems to roll
right off of his back.

14:38.162 --> 14:40.124
Everything is hard for me.

14:42.318 --> 14:44.199
I put on a good act,
but on the inside,

14:44.276 --> 14:47.124
I'm checking every gesture,
every facial expression.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.616
I stand in front
of the mirror at night,

14:49.693 --> 14:52.711
and I practice how to smile.

14:53.177 --> 14:55.406
Not too much;
just the right amount.

14:57.412 --> 14:58.746
Do you have to be white

14:58.823 --> 15:00.366
to move through
the world like that,

15:00.443 --> 15:01.825
with that kind
of confidence,

15:01.902 --> 15:04.085
or is it
something else?

15:04.162 --> 15:06.437
Some kind of
sociopathy, maybe.

15:08.443 --> 15:10.583
Is there really a difference?"

15:12.489 --> 15:14.374
That's all I have.

15:33.998 --> 15:35.365
Yo.

15:36.482 --> 15:38.082
Mr. Solloway.

15:39.740 --> 15:40.804
You okay?

15:40.881 --> 15:42.583
No, I'm not okay, Anton.

15:42.717 --> 15:44.500
What the fuck was that?

15:44.584 --> 15:45.653
What? In class?

15:45.730 --> 15:46.954
Yes, in class.

15:47.031 --> 15:49.280
I'm busting my ass for you.
I've driven across

15:49.357 --> 15:51.052
the entire fucking country
to bring you here,

15:51.129 --> 15:52.919
and all this time,
that's what you think of me?

15:52.996 --> 15:54.083
I thought you'd be proud.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.408
Are you insane?

15:55.485 --> 15:57.258
I did well in there.

15:57.427 --> 15:58.835
I kicked ass, actually.

15:58.912 --> 16:00.208
I'm definitely getting back in.

16:00.285 --> 16:02.560
- And that's all you care about?
- Look, I wrote that piece

16:02.628 --> 16:04.161
because I knew
that's what they wanted.

16:04.238 --> 16:05.616
And they ate that shit up.

16:05.684 --> 16:07.455
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, they started the class

16:07.523 --> 16:09.332
talking about
fucking segregation.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.262
Okay, I heard that,
and I was like, "Okay.

16:11.339 --> 16:13.279
I understand the role
y'all want me to play."

16:13.521 --> 16:14.843
Jesus Christ.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.727
When in Rome, right?

16:17.031 --> 16:18.903
You can't take
people's lives, Anton.

16:18.980 --> 16:21.700
You can't fucking use people
to get what you want.

16:21.777 --> 16:24.583
That's... that-that is fucking
sociopathic behavior.

16:25.099 --> 16:27.241
I thought that was called
being a writer.

16:27.318 --> 16:28.658
Well, you don't understand
the first thing

16:28.735 --> 16:30.203
about being a writer.

16:30.381 --> 16:31.943
Really?

16:32.599 --> 16:34.454
So, Descent, Alana,

16:34.531 --> 16:36.328
that wasn't about
your dead wife?

16:37.101 --> 16:38.226
Fuck you.

16:38.365 --> 16:39.739
Noah, what are you
even doing here?

16:39.816 --> 16:40.786
I'm trying to help you.

16:40.863 --> 16:42.049
That's what I'm
fucking doing here.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.224
Okay, but your wife,
she just died.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.980
Shouldn't you be there?

16:49.209 --> 16:50.530
You shouldn't be here, okay?

16:50.607 --> 16:53.414
This is... it's weird.

16:53.904 --> 16:56.430
Wow, that's a hell of a way
to say thank you.

17:02.323 --> 17:04.034
Look, it's late.
We better get to the airport.

17:04.111 --> 17:06.167
Actually thought I'd stick
around for a couple hours,

17:06.244 --> 17:07.162
check out the campus some more.

17:07.239 --> 17:08.617
Yeah, well, I promised
your mother I'd put you

17:08.694 --> 17:11.117
- back on a plane, so let's go.
- Hey, look. See this?

17:11.459 --> 17:12.930
It's called an iPhone.

17:13.093 --> 17:15.458
Okay, it has maps
and a clock and this thing

17:15.535 --> 17:16.645
called the Internet.

17:16.722 --> 17:18.805
And I can call a cab
whenever I want.

17:20.676 --> 17:22.961
I'm 19 years old.
I'll be fine.

17:26.473 --> 17:27.709
You sure?

17:27.896 --> 17:29.072
Sure.

17:29.740 --> 17:31.127
You should take care
of yourself.

17:31.204 --> 17:32.283
It's been a long week.

17:32.360 --> 17:33.698
Yeah.

17:33.826 --> 17:35.906
I need to buy a fucking suit.

17:36.216 --> 17:38.526
There's got to be a Brooks
Brothers around here somewhere.

17:38.603 --> 17:40.445
This place is like
a fucking mall.

17:48.244 --> 17:50.004
So, you gonna go?

17:51.408 --> 17:53.177
I might.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.906
Hey, Noah.

18:01.224 --> 18:02.576
Thank you.

18:03.130 --> 18:04.442
Don't mention it.

18:04.519 --> 18:05.865
Seriously.

18:06.372 --> 18:07.787
I had fun.

18:11.487 --> 18:13.242
Sorry about Alison.

18:15.872 --> 18:17.589
Yeah. Me, too.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.590
Me, too.

18:57.871 --> 18:59.746
Cole?

19:00.481 --> 19:01.898
You okay?

19:02.845 --> 19:04.866
Baby, we don't want
to be late.

19:12.531 --> 19:14.332
Hey, Cole.

19:15.145 --> 19:17.669
Can you help me
with this, please?

19:23.635 --> 19:24.838
Thank you.

19:24.921 --> 19:28.286
Um, I put the candles
in the trunk.

19:29.403 --> 19:31.919
The votives Athena asked for?

19:36.159 --> 19:37.624
I was watching that.

19:37.893 --> 19:39.666
We should get you dressed.

19:48.573 --> 19:50.241
Want me to unpack these for you?

19:50.318 --> 19:52.499
No, I'll take care of it later.

19:53.740 --> 19:56.497
But you've been back
two days.

19:58.471 --> 20:00.880
Exactly.
It's only been two days.

20:06.093 --> 20:08.478
But you're planning
to unpack, right?

20:08.801 --> 20:10.728
I mean, eventually?

20:16.807 --> 20:18.715
Look, Cole, I...

20:18.792 --> 20:21.949
don't want to have a big
conversation right now, but...

20:22.026 --> 20:23.957
I need to know your plans,

20:24.034 --> 20:25.157
what to tell Joanie.

20:25.234 --> 20:27.457
I have no idea
what to tell Joanie.

20:27.534 --> 20:29.074
That her mother
just killed herself?

20:29.151 --> 20:30.520
Should I start with that?

20:39.434 --> 20:41.709
I just need a second, please.

20:44.156 --> 20:46.974
Please, I just need
to get dressed,

20:47.051 --> 20:48.579
and I need to bury Alison,

20:48.656 --> 20:51.199
and then we can talk
for as long as you like.

20:51.276 --> 20:53.833
We can talk all night
if you want.

20:54.129 --> 20:55.606
Okay?

20:56.145 --> 20:58.717
Yeah. Yeah.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.795
No, Athena moved
the service to the beach.

21:23.551 --> 21:24.777
Why didn't you tell me?

21:24.854 --> 21:26.364
I did.

22:49.156 --> 22:50.870
<i>traditional
mourning color in China.</i>

22:50.947 --> 22:53.542
<i>You know, purity, which I think
is more important than...</i>

22:53.657 --> 22:55.230
What the fuck, Athena?

22:59.081 --> 23:00.345
Cole.

23:00.845 --> 23:02.907
Thank you for being here, Cole.

23:02.984 --> 23:05.207
Where else would I be?

23:06.698 --> 23:08.811
Alison's at peace now.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.983
Don't you think?

23:10.060 --> 23:11.236
What is that?

23:12.895 --> 23:14.241
That's our Alison.

23:14.318 --> 23:16.704
I told you I wanted to bury her.

23:16.781 --> 23:19.583
I understand that's
what you wanted, Cole,

23:19.981 --> 23:21.783
but this is what
she would have wanted.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.541
A beaching ceremony.

23:23.638 --> 23:25.191
After the service,

23:25.268 --> 23:27.854
everyone will get
a little bit of Alison's ashes

23:27.931 --> 23:31.166
to bury in the sand,
and then we meditate,

23:31.243 --> 23:33.902
we sing, we celebrate,

23:33.979 --> 23:36.833
as we wait for the tide to rise

23:37.323 --> 23:39.700
and wash her back into the sea.

23:41.635 --> 23:44.991
Doesn't that sound like something
Alison would have loved?

23:45.068 --> 23:47.434
She would have hated this.

23:47.565 --> 23:50.105
Alison hated the ocean.

23:50.182 --> 23:52.064
And we agreed that she
was going to be buried

23:52.141 --> 23:53.673
in my family's plot
next to Gabriel.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.995
But, Cole, sweetheart,
why would we bury her

23:56.072 --> 23:57.700
with your family?
She's my daughter.

23:57.777 --> 23:59.499
She's my wife.

24:08.151 --> 24:09.926
I'm sorry for your loss.

24:10.010 --> 24:13.434
My darling, I'm sorry
for your loss.

24:14.197 --> 24:16.032
Okay, we should get started.

24:16.109 --> 24:17.957
Let's get started, everyone.

24:27.434 --> 24:30.098
Thank you all for coming.

24:30.656 --> 24:32.239
Oh, my darlings.

24:32.335 --> 24:35.970
I haven't prepared a eulogy.

24:37.190 --> 24:38.931
I don't, um, believe

24:39.008 --> 24:42.512
that memorials should be
dictatorships with one voice.

24:43.026 --> 24:46.011
How can I speak
to the Alison you knew

24:46.088 --> 24:47.833
when she was with you?

24:48.033 --> 24:49.448
To you?

24:49.627 --> 24:51.331
You all deserve

24:51.408 --> 24:53.911
a chance to say good-bye
in your own way.

24:54.303 --> 24:56.283
And so...

24:57.281 --> 25:01.995
before we, um, distribute ashes
for the beaching ceremony,

25:02.072 --> 25:03.750
we'll pass her around

25:03.830 --> 25:05.932
and hold her
one last time.

25:06.010 --> 25:08.249
And when she comes to you...

25:10.432 --> 25:13.043
you hold her close
to your heart and say good-bye.

25:13.487 --> 25:15.395
I'll begin.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.448
If I can.

25:28.455 --> 25:30.286
Oh, my baby.

25:30.643 --> 25:32.666
I remember...

25:33.119 --> 25:35.662
God, one time
when you were little,

25:35.739 --> 25:39.754
you brought home a...
a lizard tail.

25:39.884 --> 25:41.629
Just the tail.

25:41.837 --> 25:43.706
You learned about
regeneration

25:43.783 --> 25:45.074
in school,
and you were sure

25:45.151 --> 25:48.916
that life
could work backwards.

25:49.111 --> 25:52.374
That this tail
could regenerate the beast.

25:56.947 --> 26:01.988
Oh, I wish I could
regenerate you now, my girl.

26:04.448 --> 26:06.892
But...

26:07.322 --> 26:08.616
I know that's selfish.

26:08.693 --> 26:11.996
That... that would
stop my pain.

26:12.114 --> 26:16.168
You, my darling,

26:16.374 --> 26:21.426
who had so much pain
in your short life,

26:22.525 --> 26:24.791
you're finally at peace.

26:35.114 --> 26:37.624
Oh, Jesus,
this is difficult.

26:45.775 --> 26:47.217
Alison, you were magic.

26:47.294 --> 26:49.517
You were light.
You...

26:52.408 --> 26:54.047
You made me believe
that anything

26:54.124 --> 26:56.124
and everything
is possible.

26:57.590 --> 26:59.433
You were wild.

27:00.984 --> 27:03.327
You were brave. You...

27:06.640 --> 27:08.858
You took nothing for granted.

27:10.489 --> 27:13.791
And you made me see
the world with new eyes.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.402
With wonder.

27:17.267 --> 27:20.003
Where does that spirit go now?

27:20.080 --> 27:21.708
I don't understand.

27:26.286 --> 27:29.261
How could you
of all people be gone?

27:31.646 --> 27:34.364
You were, uh...

27:34.610 --> 27:38.104
You were so empathetic,

27:38.181 --> 27:41.157
so concerned with
the suffering of others,

27:41.234 --> 27:43.499
including me.

28:15.356 --> 28:17.064
Cole.

29:35.871 --> 29:37.897
So, what's the plan here?

29:38.832 --> 29:40.444
There is no plan.

29:43.614 --> 29:46.665
Funerals bring out
the worst in people.

29:51.504 --> 29:53.556
Alison's gone, Cole.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.752
It doesn't matter
where she's buried.

29:57.348 --> 30:00.624
So, why not just let Athena
have her moment

30:00.832 --> 30:03.551
as chief mourner
so we can all go home

30:03.628 --> 30:05.811
to a more
private grief?

30:07.489 --> 30:09.156
No.

30:10.868 --> 30:13.233
You're not the only one
who loved her.

30:13.324 --> 30:15.056
Don't I know it.

30:19.704 --> 30:21.288
Look, Cole...

30:24.807 --> 30:26.709
I know you're in pain.

30:28.072 --> 30:29.972
And you may not want
to hear this right now,

30:30.049 --> 30:31.566
but so are
the rest of us.

30:31.643 --> 30:33.783
We're all reeling.

30:34.947 --> 30:36.916
And that ceremony, it...

30:38.573 --> 30:40.480
It meant a great deal to Athena,

30:40.557 --> 30:42.708
who is her mother.

30:42.817 --> 30:45.000
You know...

30:45.098 --> 30:47.666
if she was still my wife,

30:47.926 --> 30:50.157
I would have got to choose
what happened to the body,

30:50.234 --> 30:52.389
and nobody would've
questioned it.

30:59.593 --> 31:01.593
I'm sorry.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.913
Why'd you do it?

31:05.285 --> 31:06.740
Why her?

31:11.642 --> 31:13.985
I was unhappy.

31:15.926 --> 31:17.958
Did she make you happy?

31:26.481 --> 31:29.041
She made me happy.

32:02.281 --> 32:05.000
How many times
you think we've had sex?

32:06.947 --> 32:09.222
I have no fucking idea.

32:11.749 --> 32:13.801
Ten thousand?

32:16.119 --> 32:17.448
Yeah.

32:19.031 --> 32:20.791
Yeah, maybe.

32:46.023 --> 32:48.324
What about you?

32:49.744 --> 32:51.374
Just hold my hand.

33:01.152 --> 33:03.829
Oh. Did I scare you?

33:05.659 --> 33:07.242
No.

33:08.382 --> 33:10.340
No.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.747
Athena sent you?

33:17.939 --> 33:19.736
She must really
be getting desperate.

33:19.813 --> 33:20.912
Athena didn't send me.

33:20.989 --> 33:22.311
I brought you
something to eat.

33:22.388 --> 33:24.783
And I thought you might
be a little cold.

33:24.860 --> 33:26.072
Yeah.

33:30.656 --> 33:33.192
Chicken salad
from the memorial.

33:33.422 --> 33:34.788
I'm not hungry.

33:34.865 --> 33:37.249
I know, but you have
to eat something.

33:47.156 --> 33:49.114
How are you feeling?

33:53.031 --> 33:55.551
I feel terrible.

33:56.229 --> 33:58.041
I know, honey.

33:59.197 --> 34:01.418
It takes time.

34:02.489 --> 34:04.249
How did you do it?

34:05.843 --> 34:08.228
When Dad died,
how did you move on?

34:08.478 --> 34:09.822
Did I?

34:11.380 --> 34:13.598
I'm glad you think so.

34:13.924 --> 34:15.907
I always hoped
for you and your brothers

34:15.984 --> 34:17.510
that I was strong

34:17.587 --> 34:20.143
and that you felt safe.

34:20.364 --> 34:23.145
Because inside... phew.

34:25.156 --> 34:28.241
After he killed himself,
I broke five watch bands

34:28.318 --> 34:30.551
in the span of two weeks.

34:32.781 --> 34:35.989
I was always pulling at them.

34:37.315 --> 34:38.750
Yanking at my wrists,

34:38.885 --> 34:42.027
trying to figure out
what to do with all my anger.

34:44.877 --> 34:47.166
It takes time.

34:48.864 --> 34:50.791
I was coming back for her.

34:58.182 --> 35:00.199
I drove across
the entire country

35:00.276 --> 35:03.000
to come and get her,
but I was too late.

35:08.999 --> 35:11.856
I am always too late.

35:14.448 --> 35:15.704
Oh, baby.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.583
It isn't your fault.

35:17.752 --> 35:20.356
None of this was.

35:20.807 --> 35:23.791
I don't understand what
I'm supposed to do with this.

35:26.283 --> 35:27.947
I don't think I can carry it.

35:28.024 --> 35:29.671
- You can.
- What if I can't?

35:29.748 --> 35:32.639
- I know you can.
- But what if I can't?

35:32.963 --> 35:34.541
Dad couldn't.

35:37.002 --> 35:39.020
And I get it now.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.801
Oh, I mean, to just go to sleep,

35:42.893 --> 35:46.527
to... to never wake up
in pain again.

35:46.604 --> 35:48.040
I know. Here's the thing.

35:48.117 --> 35:49.864
You're not like your dad.

35:50.281 --> 35:52.989
You're not a Lockhart.
You're a McGinty.

35:53.658 --> 35:55.332
You're like me.

35:55.729 --> 35:58.166
You're a survivor.
You're a fighter.

35:58.525 --> 36:01.473
You told me I am
exactly like Dad.

36:01.744 --> 36:03.462
Well, if I did,
then I was wrong.

36:03.539 --> 36:05.618
- No, but...
- Sweetie, there are people

36:05.695 --> 36:07.303
in the world
like your father.

36:07.380 --> 36:08.486
Like Alison.

36:08.563 --> 36:11.293
Magical, special people.

36:11.932 --> 36:14.447
And we love them
for their sensitive souls,

36:14.524 --> 36:17.082
and we love them
for burning so brightly.

36:18.442 --> 36:22.868
But I think I always knew
your father was...

36:23.416 --> 36:24.893
ephemeral,

36:25.041 --> 36:26.346
even before he...

36:26.423 --> 36:28.689
I mean, that's why
I sent him to California.

36:28.766 --> 36:32.041
That's why
I let him have Nan.

36:33.223 --> 36:35.165
'Cause I-I knew
somehow, deep inside,

36:35.242 --> 36:37.583
I couldn't keep him forever.

36:37.737 --> 36:41.590
He wasn't solid,
like you and me.

36:42.754 --> 36:44.847
He was made of too much air.

36:46.072 --> 36:48.207
So you knew about Nan.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.374
Then you sent me out there
to... find her?

36:56.190 --> 36:57.939
- Why?
- I don't know, Cole.

36:58.016 --> 37:02.036
I think I wanted you
to see that life is...

37:02.197 --> 37:05.051
God, I... it's messy, honey.

37:05.239 --> 37:09.449
And you've had more mess,
more tragedy in your life

37:09.526 --> 37:11.374
than most people.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.597
And your answer,
like mine,

37:14.674 --> 37:16.575
is to try
and take control,

37:16.652 --> 37:18.750
and sometimes
you just can't.

37:20.268 --> 37:22.324
And I want to tell you
that the worst of it

37:22.401 --> 37:24.283
is just behind you
and that it's...

37:24.360 --> 37:26.778
it's all gonna get better
from here on out.

37:26.865 --> 37:28.916
And I hope it does.

37:29.963 --> 37:32.575
Baby, it might not, and...

37:33.823 --> 37:35.825
All I've ever wanted,

37:35.932 --> 37:38.288
all that I wish for you,

37:38.533 --> 37:41.489
is for you to know you're strong

37:42.166 --> 37:44.106
and you can survive.

37:45.026 --> 37:47.329
So you can be
the shelter for Joanie

37:47.406 --> 37:49.583
the way I tried
to shelter you.

38:00.963 --> 38:03.575
Oh, not everyone
gets to grow old, Cole,

38:03.652 --> 38:05.583
but if I had to bet...

38:07.690 --> 38:09.666
I would say
that you will.

38:14.323 --> 38:15.907
And the sooner
that you understand that

38:15.984 --> 38:19.145
as the great,
radical gift it is,

38:19.682 --> 38:23.995
the sooner that you start
to think of what you have

38:24.072 --> 38:26.207
instead of what
you've lost...

38:28.239 --> 38:31.499
the happier you and
your little girl are gonna be.

39:01.656 --> 39:03.750
Is Joanie asleep?

39:05.656 --> 39:07.234
Yep.

39:11.645 --> 39:12.945
Thank you.

39:13.999 --> 39:15.759
I love her.

39:17.476 --> 39:19.166
I know you do.

39:25.114 --> 39:27.798
Whatever happened
to those hardship papers?

39:27.960 --> 39:30.072
I think we should
get 'em filed.

39:31.497 --> 39:33.455
It's too late.

39:34.601 --> 39:36.330
No, we're done.

39:39.101 --> 39:40.508
Luisa, I'm sorry.

39:40.585 --> 39:42.583
Cole, just listen
to me for once.

39:42.796 --> 39:44.624
We're done.

39:48.531 --> 39:50.259
I know we're done.

39:50.448 --> 39:52.986
And I'm sorry for
everything that I said.

39:54.109 --> 39:56.332
And I'm sorry for
the things that I've done.

39:56.843 --> 39:59.624
You deserve
better than that.

39:59.788 --> 40:02.392
We don't have
to split up.

40:02.655 --> 40:04.361
We can stay married.

40:04.601 --> 40:07.166
At least on paper.

40:07.398 --> 40:10.291
And we'll make you
Joanie's legal guardian,

40:10.554 --> 40:12.958
and we'll finally get you
your citizenship.

40:23.116 --> 40:25.291
What are we gonna tell Joanie?

40:27.991 --> 40:29.916
Right now I think I...

40:31.531 --> 40:34.499
I'd just like to take her
on a little trip.

40:36.077 --> 40:40.583
Just the two of us, to...

40:41.038 --> 40:43.499
get away from here
for a little while.

40:46.648 --> 40:48.012
When she gets back,
she's gonna need

40:48.089 --> 40:49.854
all the love she can get.

40:51.288 --> 40:53.332
And she needs you, Luisa.

41:05.031 --> 41:06.845
What does that mean?

41:13.031 --> 41:15.533
You know what?
I think we should...

41:16.687 --> 41:19.431
we should go to bed
tonight, and, uh...

41:20.406 --> 41:22.619
I'll help Joanie pack tomorrow.

41:32.937 --> 41:34.498
When we get
to our vacation,

41:34.575 --> 41:36.589
will Mommy be there?

41:37.615 --> 41:40.416
Nope. Just gonna be
you and me, kiddo.

41:40.921 --> 41:43.207
Where is Mommy?

41:45.265 --> 41:48.082
Some people think
that when you die

41:48.234 --> 41:49.912
your soul goes up to Heaven.

41:49.989 --> 41:51.788
And some people think

41:51.865 --> 41:54.280
that you get to come back
as a different person

41:54.357 --> 41:55.750
or even an animal.

41:56.757 --> 41:58.246
But what about you?

41:58.323 --> 42:00.423
Where do you think Mommy is?

42:04.531 --> 42:06.583
I wish I knew, kiddo.

42:09.239 --> 42:12.958
But I do know that she
will always be here.

42:13.355 --> 42:15.240
And whenever you miss her,

42:15.317 --> 42:16.956
all we have to do
is think about her

42:17.033 --> 42:18.415
and remember her,
and that way,

42:18.492 --> 42:20.298
she will always be with us.

43:52.226 --> 43:54.041
I'll send in Dr. Woo.

43:54.163 --> 43:55.573
Thank you.

44:15.265 --> 44:16.515
Helen.

44:16.671 --> 44:17.803
Hmm?

44:18.052 --> 44:20.533
- You're hurting me.
- Oh.

44:20.610 --> 44:22.072
Sorry.

44:29.406 --> 44:32.016
This place is
kind of a mess, huh?

44:35.698 --> 44:37.610
How do you feel?

44:39.140 --> 44:40.819
I'm cold.

44:47.656 --> 44:49.342
I got you.

44:54.531 --> 44:56.037
- How's that?
- Thank you.

44:56.114 --> 44:57.494
Mm-hmm.

44:59.083 --> 45:00.844
I love you.

45:11.155 --> 45:12.406
Hey.

45:12.796 --> 45:14.037
Good news, Vik.

45:14.114 --> 45:16.282
- The cholecystitis has subsided.
- Oh.

45:16.359 --> 45:18.499
Morning, Doc.

45:19.092 --> 45:21.313
- Helen, can you, uh...?
- Yeah.

45:21.411 --> 45:24.372
The ultrasound
of your right

45:24.449 --> 45:26.371
confirms what the
lab results indicate.

45:26.448 --> 45:28.685
Your leukocyte count
and your bilirubin levels

45:28.762 --> 45:30.454
have come significantly down.

45:30.531 --> 45:32.329
Your amylase
and your lipase levels

45:32.406 --> 45:33.491
have normalized, too.

45:33.568 --> 45:35.448
Oh. Wow.

45:35.531 --> 45:36.616
What does that mean?

45:36.693 --> 45:38.283
Well, it means he got lucky.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.548
We caught the
cholecystitis quickly.

45:41.281 --> 45:42.784
So I can go home.

45:42.861 --> 45:45.736
I want to keep you here
for another day or two,

45:45.813 --> 45:48.074
but if you're not febrile
in 24 hours,

45:48.151 --> 45:49.707
I'll send you home on Friday.

45:51.385 --> 45:52.875
Thanks, Doc.

45:53.526 --> 45:55.381
Uh, but listen.

45:55.458 --> 45:58.593
Now that this current
crisis is averted,

45:59.033 --> 46:01.989
I want to talk to you again
about treatment.

46:02.260 --> 46:04.157
If you continue
to go untreated,

46:04.234 --> 46:05.950
I guarantee you

46:06.126 --> 46:09.246
you will be back here
with something much worse.

46:09.781 --> 46:11.707
Thrombophlebitis.

46:12.549 --> 46:14.222
Perforated
stomach lining.

46:14.299 --> 46:16.897
S-Something that you just
cannot bounce back from.

46:16.974 --> 46:18.835
- You're metastatic.
- I know that.

46:18.912 --> 46:20.695
Right, so you would also know

46:20.772 --> 46:23.389
that we typically like
to treat metastatic patients

46:23.466 --> 46:24.957
very aggressively.

46:25.072 --> 46:27.624
I'm past surgery, Kristina.

46:28.236 --> 46:29.658
That's not an option for me.

46:29.735 --> 46:31.934
Chemo could shrink
this tumor.

46:32.494 --> 46:34.522
And how much time
would that actually buy me?

46:34.599 --> 46:36.324
Conservatively,
six to nine months.

46:36.401 --> 46:38.542
And here's the thing.

46:38.619 --> 46:42.262
Treatment will improve
your quality of life.

46:43.666 --> 46:45.111
Look, Vik.

46:46.830 --> 46:49.583
I have seen this before.

46:49.854 --> 46:51.199
There's a reason
they say

46:51.276 --> 46:53.708
that doctors make
the worst patients.

46:54.791 --> 46:56.933
We all have
God complexes.

46:57.010 --> 46:58.204
And when we get sick,

46:58.281 --> 47:00.000
we're fucking pissed.

47:00.330 --> 47:02.000
I understand that.

47:03.541 --> 47:04.610
But you know what?

47:04.687 --> 47:06.931
You obviously have
someone in your life

47:07.008 --> 47:09.230
that loves you
very much,

47:09.307 --> 47:10.728
and they want you
to stick around,

47:10.805 --> 47:12.700
so forgive me for what
I'm about to say,

47:12.777 --> 47:14.290
but I've known you
for, what,

47:14.367 --> 47:15.711
almost 20 years?

47:15.788 --> 47:18.007
You're being an asshole.

47:21.740 --> 47:24.692
This is exactly why
we broke up, Kristina.

47:25.322 --> 47:27.082
You've got a potty mouth.

47:30.940 --> 47:32.916
Why don't
you two talk it over?

47:33.533 --> 47:35.025
It was nice to
see you again, Helen.

47:35.102 --> 47:37.000
Nice to see you,
Kristina.

47:43.533 --> 47:45.541
Why did you two break up?

47:48.088 --> 47:49.534
She matched in L.A.

47:49.611 --> 47:51.249
I matched in New York.

47:52.854 --> 47:54.096
We were 26.

47:54.173 --> 47:56.101
We thought we had
all the time in the world.

47:59.656 --> 48:01.668
She was wonderful, though.

48:03.171 --> 48:04.848
She still is.

48:08.143 --> 48:11.254
I mean, I think she had to...

48:12.486 --> 48:14.009
go out of her way to treat you.

48:14.086 --> 48:16.097
She had to move
a lot of stuff around.

48:16.322 --> 48:17.781
Yeah.

48:23.023 --> 48:26.059
So, do you want to talk
about, uh... all that?

48:29.658 --> 48:31.624
Can we do it later?

48:32.182 --> 48:34.309
- When I come home?
- Sure.

48:35.806 --> 48:37.691
That's fine.
No problem.

48:37.830 --> 48:39.449
Your parents are
on their way over anyway.

48:39.526 --> 48:41.833
I was gonna run home
and just, um,

48:42.010 --> 48:43.283
take a shower,
change my clothes.

48:43.360 --> 48:44.802
Yeah, you should.

48:44.879 --> 48:46.791
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

48:49.323 --> 48:51.332
- Helen.
- Yeah.

48:55.394 --> 48:57.863
I hate putting you through this.

48:58.628 --> 49:01.791
I never wanted to be
a burden on anyone.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.615
Stop.

49:18.448 --> 49:20.137
- Hi.
- Hi. How is he?

49:20.214 --> 49:21.742
He's better.
Uh, he's better.

49:21.819 --> 49:24.896
Apparently, the infection
in his gallbladder's, um...

49:24.973 --> 49:26.496
receding?
Is that the word?

49:26.573 --> 49:28.981
His gallbladder?
I-I thought this was cancer

49:29.058 --> 49:30.130
- of the pancreas.
- It is.

49:30.198 --> 49:31.918
But apparently,
the tumor in the pancreas

49:31.995 --> 49:33.449
is putting pressure
on the gallbladder,

49:33.526 --> 49:36.187
and there's been some kind
of bi... bile buildup.

49:36.264 --> 49:39.496
I don't really understand,
but you could ask, um,

49:39.573 --> 49:42.449
his doctor when she gets here,
Kristina Woo.

49:42.526 --> 49:44.241
- I think you know her.
- What?

49:44.318 --> 49:46.908
Kristina is here
to take care of him?

49:46.985 --> 49:49.354
- Who?
- Kristina, Abdul.

49:49.431 --> 49:51.470
Little Kristina
from Stanford.

49:51.547 --> 49:52.902
Oh, his girlfriend?

49:52.979 --> 49:54.814
Well, ex-girlfriend, but yeah.

49:54.891 --> 49:56.316
Oh, praise Heaven.

49:56.393 --> 49:58.300
Well, I've also
been taking care of him,

49:58.377 --> 49:59.866
- you know...
- Kristina will help him.

49:59.943 --> 50:01.921
Yes, she will get him
the medicine he needs.

50:01.998 --> 50:04.225
She got a perfect score
on her medical boards.

50:04.302 --> 50:06.817
Absolutely perfect.
Not one mistake.

50:06.906 --> 50:09.704
Well, it was perfect.

50:09.781 --> 50:11.887
Okay. Well, I have to go home
'cause I still have

50:11.964 --> 50:14.990
some vomit on me from when...
Never mind.

50:15.067 --> 50:16.993
I'm just gonna...
I'll see you this evening.

50:17.156 --> 50:19.962
You should go and take care
of yourself, Helen.

50:20.093 --> 50:21.759
You look tired.

50:29.616 --> 50:32.031
Surprise!

50:32.114 --> 50:34.569
Whitney. Whitney.

50:34.646 --> 50:36.291
- Hi!
- Hi.

50:36.531 --> 50:38.267
Hey there, Colin.

50:39.392 --> 50:40.795
What are you doing here?

50:40.872 --> 50:42.870
We came to surprise you.

50:42.947 --> 50:45.272
Oh, that's nice.
What about school?

50:45.349 --> 50:46.893
It's Thanksgiving.

50:49.801 --> 50:51.052
Is it?

50:52.016 --> 50:53.561
Oh, God.
Yeah, of course.

50:53.638 --> 50:54.819
It's November.

50:55.871 --> 50:58.110
- Right.
- So, where is everybody?

50:58.187 --> 51:01.415
Um, your brother and sister
are with your dad,

51:01.492 --> 51:04.109
and, uh, Martin went
to the Cape with Mariah.

51:04.186 --> 51:05.666
No, he didn't.

51:06.133 --> 51:07.431
They broke up.

51:07.508 --> 51:08.741
- They did?
- Mm-hmm.

51:08.818 --> 51:10.165
- When?
- Last week.

51:10.242 --> 51:12.687
He's coming, too.
He'll be here in a few days.

51:12.764 --> 51:14.704
Hey, I'm so happy
that we get

51:14.781 --> 51:16.533
to spend Thanksgiving together,
all four of us again.

51:16.610 --> 51:18.517
And I was thinking,

51:18.594 --> 51:20.708
what if we invited
Dad this year?

51:21.281 --> 51:23.151
Do you think Vik would mind?

51:26.328 --> 51:29.198
Mom, are you okay?

51:29.453 --> 51:31.153
I'm just really happy
to have you home. That's all.

51:31.230 --> 51:32.194
Oh, my God.

51:32.271 --> 51:33.721
Mom, come on. Don't cry.

51:33.798 --> 51:35.741
I told Colin you are
a total ball-buster

51:35.818 --> 51:37.708
and that's why I'm so fucked up.

51:37.969 --> 51:39.695
Now he's gonna think I'm lying.

51:39.772 --> 51:42.268
It's nice to see you again,
Mrs. Solloway.

51:42.906 --> 51:44.366
It's nice
to see you, Colin.

51:44.443 --> 51:45.949
Are you guys hungry?

51:46.026 --> 51:48.456
Do you want
something to eat?

51:48.533 --> 51:49.563
I'll make you
an omelet or something.

51:49.640 --> 51:50.741
Mom, we're vegans.

51:50.818 --> 51:52.432
Fuck. Right.

51:52.509 --> 51:53.625
I keep forgetting.

51:53.702 --> 51:54.893
So, what does that mean?

51:54.970 --> 51:56.977
I have to pick up
almond milk or...?

51:57.054 --> 51:59.457
Yeah, don't worry.
We'll make our own.

52:00.521 --> 52:02.572
You'll make your own
almond milk?

52:02.669 --> 52:03.923
Totally. We stopped
at Whole Foods

52:04.000 --> 52:05.707
and got some
stuff already.

52:06.947 --> 52:08.933
Well, that's one less thing
to worry about.

52:09.010 --> 52:11.037
Uh, you guys,
the place is yours.

52:11.114 --> 52:12.663
Colin, there's a
really nice pool there

52:12.740 --> 52:13.780
if you want
to take a swim.

52:13.857 --> 52:15.977
This place is sick,
Mrs. Solloway.

52:16.054 --> 52:18.183
Thanks. I like it, too.

52:19.384 --> 52:21.417
So, uh, is it
just us tonight?

52:21.494 --> 52:22.837
Are Trevor
and Stacey coming?

52:22.914 --> 52:25.932
I was thinking of making
saag paneer for Vik.

52:26.009 --> 52:27.688
I'm taking this
Indian cooking course,

52:27.765 --> 52:28.825
and I'm kind of good.

52:28.902 --> 52:30.449
No, she's really good.

52:30.526 --> 52:31.774
Yeah, I am.

52:31.851 --> 52:34.473
Hashtag "humble brag."
I'm really good.

52:36.028 --> 52:38.277
Actually, Vik's not
gonna be here tonight.

52:38.354 --> 52:39.663
He's in the hospital.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.638
Come on, tell him
to beg off early.

52:41.715 --> 52:43.432
I'm only here for a couple days.

52:43.509 --> 52:45.261
Tell him, like,
punt the surgery.

52:45.338 --> 52:46.905
Is Vik a surgeon?

52:47.004 --> 52:48.001
You didn't
tell me that.

52:48.078 --> 52:50.897
Yeah, he is.
He's, like, a super-surgeon.

52:51.239 --> 52:53.366
Whit, actually,
he's not at the hospital.

52:53.443 --> 52:55.583
He's in the hospital.

52:55.887 --> 52:57.166
Uh, he's sick.

52:57.535 --> 52:59.225
What? What do you mean?

52:59.302 --> 53:00.523
I'm sorry.

53:00.726 --> 53:01.724
I should have told you.

53:01.801 --> 53:04.056
- I meant to tell you.
- You should have told me what?

53:05.580 --> 53:07.423
Vik has cancer.

53:09.637 --> 53:10.763
What?

53:11.948 --> 53:13.916
It's stage four.

53:18.573 --> 53:22.783
S-So... is he...

53:23.609 --> 53:24.887
is he gonna...?

53:24.964 --> 53:25.947
Yeah.

53:26.171 --> 53:27.191
No.

53:27.268 --> 53:28.443
- Yeah.
- No.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.535
Look, I'm sorry.

53:29.612 --> 53:31.496
I really didn't want you
to find out this way.

53:31.573 --> 53:33.233
I-I-I wanted to
call you a while ago,

53:33.310 --> 53:36.069
but you just seemed so happy,
and I didn't want to ruin that.

53:36.146 --> 53:37.603
What the fuck is wrong with you?

53:37.937 --> 53:40.069
- With me?
- This is why Trevor and Stacey

53:40.146 --> 53:41.069
have been such zombies

53:41.146 --> 53:42.684
when I've talked to them
on the phone.

53:42.761 --> 53:45.408
God, Helen, you are
so fucking irresponsible.

53:45.485 --> 53:47.674
- Whitney.
- Just once,

53:47.751 --> 53:49.365
one time, I'd like to come home

53:49.442 --> 53:51.207
to some fucking normalcy
for a change.

53:51.284 --> 53:52.928
I have my shit
together.

53:53.005 --> 53:54.116
Why can't you?

53:54.193 --> 53:56.875
Can you please...

53:57.288 --> 53:59.325
this time...

53:59.780 --> 54:00.947
just not?

54:01.024 --> 54:02.656
Not what?

54:03.072 --> 54:04.511
Be a bitch.

54:04.604 --> 54:06.074
I'm really sorry
that this

54:06.151 --> 54:08.079
isn't the reality
that you thought

54:08.156 --> 54:10.250
you were walking into
at this particular moment,

54:10.327 --> 54:11.949
but that's...
this is what's going on.

54:12.026 --> 54:14.027
This is what is going on.

54:14.119 --> 54:15.582
Did you just call me a bitch?

54:15.665 --> 54:16.883
Hello.

54:16.960 --> 54:18.725
- Oh...
- Anyone home?

54:18.802 --> 54:19.938
Hi, Sierra.

54:20.015 --> 54:21.459
- Hi.
- How are you?

54:21.536 --> 54:24.079
I'm good.
Um, oh, my God.

54:24.156 --> 54:25.412
Is this your
daughter?

54:25.489 --> 54:27.897
Um, yes, this is my daughter
and her boyfriend,

54:27.974 --> 54:30.624
and this is my friend, Sierra.

54:30.833 --> 54:32.246
- Hey.
- Hi.

54:32.323 --> 54:34.713
Oh, my God. It's so great
to finally meet you.

54:34.790 --> 54:36.991
Mom, can we not
do this right now?

54:37.068 --> 54:39.701
- Do what?
- Meet someone.

54:39.778 --> 54:41.144
I-I need to talk to you.

54:41.221 --> 54:43.204
Is this a bad time?
I can come back.

54:43.281 --> 54:45.217
Why don't you just give me
a moment with my friend,

54:45.294 --> 54:46.157
and you guys can go fuck

54:46.234 --> 54:47.796
in the spare guest room
or something.

54:48.294 --> 54:50.608
God, this is
so fucking typical, Helen.

54:50.685 --> 54:52.408
Can you please stop
calling me Helen?

54:52.485 --> 54:54.499
You never change,
do you?

54:58.044 --> 55:00.535
Sorry about that,
Mrs. Solloway.

55:00.612 --> 55:02.124
She's, um...

55:02.208 --> 55:04.241
just started
a new birth control,

55:04.318 --> 55:08.023
and it's making her,
you know, kind of mad.

55:08.210 --> 55:10.265
It's fine, Colin.
I'm used to it.

55:11.763 --> 55:14.430
Wow. She is a force.

55:14.507 --> 55:16.308
Yeah. That she is.

55:18.013 --> 55:20.166
I brought this for you.

55:20.310 --> 55:22.708
It's called a white butterfly.

55:23.349 --> 55:24.750
What's the occasion?

55:24.872 --> 55:26.058
No occasion.

55:26.135 --> 55:27.366
I've just been thinking about

55:27.443 --> 55:30.148
how blessed I am
to have you in my life.

55:31.919 --> 55:33.285
Are you okay?
You look tired.

55:33.362 --> 55:34.791
No, I'm fine.

55:37.573 --> 55:39.396
I, um...

55:40.419 --> 55:41.704
I-I can't stop thinking about

55:41.781 --> 55:43.324
what happened
between us in the desert.

55:43.401 --> 55:44.656
Yeah.

55:44.740 --> 55:46.996
- Um...
- Have you been avoiding me?

55:47.073 --> 55:50.000
No.
No, no, that's not it at all.

55:50.968 --> 55:52.238
Okay.

55:52.315 --> 55:55.934
Um, good, because I-I have
something to tell you.

55:56.011 --> 55:57.678
Yeah, can it wait?

55:57.755 --> 56:00.929
Uh, no, not...
not really.

56:01.356 --> 56:03.972
It's just that, uh,
Vik is in the hospital.

56:04.049 --> 56:05.763
Wh-Why?

56:05.947 --> 56:08.569
Because he has cancer
and he's not treating it,

56:08.646 --> 56:10.100
so the tumor won't stop growing,

56:10.177 --> 56:11.658
and now it's pressing
against his gallbladder,

56:11.735 --> 56:14.699
which, of course, is infected
because why can't anything

56:14.776 --> 56:18.281
ever be just okay
for one fucking minute?

56:20.330 --> 56:22.882
Helen, I'm... I'm so sorry.

56:26.242 --> 56:27.668
It's his mom.

56:28.497 --> 56:29.866
Hello, Priya.

56:31.716 --> 56:34.074
What? I don't... No, you're
gonna have to slow down.

56:34.151 --> 56:35.958
I don't understand
what you're saying.

56:38.114 --> 56:40.031
Septic?

56:40.333 --> 56:42.109
Are you sure?

56:42.656 --> 56:44.459
Okay. Yes, all right,
I'm on my way.

56:44.536 --> 56:45.801
Yes, no, I'm leaving now.

56:45.878 --> 56:46.989
Now.

56:47.072 --> 56:48.283
Is everything okay?

56:48.360 --> 56:49.656
Uh, no.

56:52.646 --> 56:54.000
I have to go.

56:54.380 --> 56:55.866
Well, let me
drive you.

56:55.943 --> 56:57.249
No, I'm okay.

56:57.419 --> 56:59.072
Helen...

56:59.692 --> 57:00.741
please let me help you.

57:00.818 --> 57:02.666
I-I want to help you.

57:06.156 --> 57:08.640
Sierra, you know
what happened in the desert,

57:08.747 --> 57:10.543
that was a one-time thing
with us, right?

57:10.620 --> 57:12.916
- I'm with Vik. I-I can't just be...
- Yes.

57:13.231 --> 57:14.615
I know.

57:16.874 --> 57:18.675
Where are your keys?

57:21.009 --> 57:22.353
I'm driving.

57:47.633 --> 57:49.509
Hi. Can I help you?

57:49.586 --> 57:51.502
Uh, there's already
two visitors, so you can't

57:51.579 --> 57:52.991
- go in right now.
- What's going on in there?

57:53.068 --> 57:54.704
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm...

57:54.781 --> 57:55.930
And where are
your visitor passes?

57:56.007 --> 57:56.954
Mine is right...

57:57.031 --> 57:58.565
Fuck, mine, it must
have slipped off.

57:58.642 --> 57:59.455
You both need passes.

57:59.532 --> 58:00.330
I need to go in there.

58:00.407 --> 58:01.279
His mother just called me.

58:01.356 --> 58:02.383
I'm sorry,
but if you're not

58:02.460 --> 58:03.389
immediate family,
you cannot go in.

58:03.466 --> 58:05.753
- I am. I'm his wife.
- Great.

58:05.923 --> 58:07.538
So then go
to the front desk,

58:07.615 --> 58:09.670
where your name is surely
on the list, and get a pass.

58:09.747 --> 58:12.329
Maybe I can go to the desk
and get passes for both of us,

58:12.406 --> 58:13.451
and then she can
go in right now.

58:13.528 --> 58:15.198
- Who are you?
- I'm her friend.

58:15.275 --> 58:16.502
You're not related to him?

58:16.579 --> 58:18.471
- No, not exactly.
- Then you need to go.

58:18.548 --> 58:19.914
Yeah, maybe you
should just go, okay?

58:19.991 --> 58:22.230
Okay, but I...
I would just like...

58:24.239 --> 58:26.253
Are you sick?

58:26.595 --> 58:29.157
This guy's already septic.
Are you trying to kill him?

58:29.234 --> 58:32.195
I was here an hour ago,
and he was fine. What happened?

58:32.272 --> 58:34.211
His immune system
is hanging on by a thread.

58:34.288 --> 58:35.426
If you have
the slightest cold...

58:35.503 --> 58:36.703
- I'm not sick.
- Well, you shouldn't even

58:36.780 --> 58:38.058
be in this hallway.
If you both don't leave,

58:38.135 --> 58:39.178
I'm gonna have
to call security.

58:39.255 --> 58:40.816
I'm not sick. I'm pregnant.

58:44.454 --> 58:45.621
You're pregnant?

58:45.698 --> 58:48.183
Yes, that's what I was
trying to tell you.

58:51.947 --> 58:53.666
Why are you trying to tell me?

59:07.505 --> 59:08.957
I'm so sorry.

59:10.974 --> 59:12.212
What?

59:13.945 --> 59:15.791
It was an accident.

59:15.868 --> 59:17.315
It was one time,

59:17.392 --> 59:18.949
and it didn't
mean anything.

59:19.026 --> 59:21.440
I don't, like,
love him or anything.

59:21.517 --> 59:23.586
I mean, if there's anyone
I love, it's-it's you.

59:23.663 --> 59:25.193
- Is this some kind of joke?
- I know this is a shock.

59:25.270 --> 59:26.616
Is that why you bought me
that fucking orchid?

59:26.693 --> 59:28.079
It was a shock to me, too.

59:28.156 --> 59:30.032
And I know that this
is such bad timing,

59:30.109 --> 59:32.583
but, Helen, I-I...
I want to keep it.

59:32.900 --> 59:34.330
I want to be a mother.

59:34.407 --> 59:36.211
Everything you said
to me in the desert,

59:36.288 --> 59:37.893
it resonated
so deeply with me.

59:37.970 --> 59:39.336
And it's like you said
to me what I've

59:39.413 --> 59:41.231
been waiting to hear
my whole life, and I...

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:19.656
Oh, God.

01:00:21.228 --> 01:00:22.534
You sound so old.

01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:24.961
You didn't used to groan
when you sat down.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.713
Why are we
sitting down here?

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.565
There's a perfectly good
bench over there.

01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:30.791
I wanted to be
low to the ground.

01:00:33.470 --> 01:00:34.825
Do you want one?

01:00:34.902 --> 01:00:36.311
Got one for you.

01:00:36.388 --> 01:00:38.028
No, thanks.

01:00:38.615 --> 01:00:40.074
What happened?

01:00:40.486 --> 01:00:42.034
Where are the kids?

01:00:42.111 --> 01:00:43.643
I dropped them
at your place.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.032
With Whitney
and the new boyfriend.

01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:46.941
Oh, yeah.
He seems nice enough.

01:00:47.087 --> 01:00:48.792
Yeah, he's okay.

01:00:49.782 --> 01:00:51.258
She's exactly the same.

01:00:51.335 --> 01:00:52.573
Yeah.

01:00:53.845 --> 01:00:55.597
What did we do wrong there?

01:00:55.899 --> 01:00:58.121
Helen, she's a kid.

01:01:00.837 --> 01:01:03.541
We were already married
by the time we were her age.

01:01:03.665 --> 01:01:05.550
Yeah, well, we were kids, too.

01:01:08.619 --> 01:01:10.162
Vik okay?

01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:13.573
No.

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:17.894
Vik is going to die.

01:01:19.486 --> 01:01:20.886
I'm so sorry.

01:01:20.993 --> 01:01:22.189
Yep.

01:01:22.608 --> 01:01:23.983
Me, too.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:28.645
I'm really, really sorry.

01:01:34.197 --> 01:01:36.527
Did you ever meet
our neighbor, Sierra?

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:37.838
Don't think so, no.

01:01:37.915 --> 01:01:40.317
- Well, she's pregnant.
- That's nice for her.

01:01:40.394 --> 01:01:41.691
With Vik's baby.

01:01:44.385 --> 01:01:45.427
What?

01:01:48.298 --> 01:01:49.413
Oh, God.

01:01:49.501 --> 01:01:50.865
Helen.

01:01:51.642 --> 01:01:54.205
Look, Vik's not in
his right mind now, you know?

01:01:54.282 --> 01:01:55.157
Look, it's already...
I don't care.

01:01:55.234 --> 01:01:56.271
I really don't care.

01:01:56.348 --> 01:01:57.821
Look, I fucked her, too.

01:01:59.661 --> 01:02:01.244
Really?

01:02:05.772 --> 01:02:07.740
What, and I missed it?

01:02:12.810 --> 01:02:14.018
Eh.

01:02:15.197 --> 01:02:17.269
I just can't
go back up there.

01:02:17.364 --> 01:02:19.292
I can't face him
like this.

01:02:19.673 --> 01:02:20.818
Well, you're pissed
with him, right?

01:02:20.895 --> 01:02:23.035
No, that's not
why I can't face him.

01:02:28.986 --> 01:02:31.082
I don't know
if I love him.

01:02:32.751 --> 01:02:34.422
I mean, the way
I'm supposed to.

01:02:34.499 --> 01:02:35.750
You know...

01:02:35.939 --> 01:02:37.624
I love him enough.

01:02:39.946 --> 01:02:41.789
What does that mean?

01:02:44.815 --> 01:02:47.167
Not the way I loved you.

01:02:53.917 --> 01:02:55.738
Helen, we were...

01:02:57.311 --> 01:02:58.917
We were young.

01:03:01.329 --> 01:03:03.363
We hadn't fucked up yet.

01:03:03.861 --> 01:03:07.274
It's just so much easier
to feel deeply for someone

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:09.332
when there's no...

01:03:09.806 --> 01:03:11.242
defenses or...

01:03:11.319 --> 01:03:12.501
Baggage?

01:03:14.683 --> 01:03:16.568
Well, yeah.

01:03:21.689 --> 01:03:23.785
God, poor Alison.

01:03:28.522 --> 01:03:30.448
How was her funeral?

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:34.078
Ah, it was awful.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:37.064
Right.

01:03:37.618 --> 01:03:40.979
No, they, uh...
her mother had her cremated,

01:03:41.056 --> 01:03:42.633
so the ceremony
was on the beach,

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:45.761
and Cole grabbed the urn
and ran away with it.

01:03:46.087 --> 01:03:48.500
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- No.

01:03:48.577 --> 01:03:50.246
Oh, my God.

01:03:50.907 --> 01:03:52.741
Everybody's
so fucking crazy.

01:03:52.818 --> 01:03:54.197
Yeah.

01:04:01.156 --> 01:04:02.916
I miss her, you know. I...

01:04:05.989 --> 01:04:08.832
Can't stop thinking
about how much I...

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.499
failed her and...

01:04:13.915 --> 01:04:16.003
how badly I fucked up.

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:30.124
You know, what happened
to her wasn't your fault.

01:04:30.290 --> 01:04:31.423
You think?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.167
No, I'm sure.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.199
How's Vik holding up?

01:04:45.923 --> 01:04:47.409
He's not good.

01:04:47.486 --> 01:04:49.253
I mean, it's like...

01:04:50.593 --> 01:04:53.117
It's like the light
has gone out of his eyes.

01:04:53.194 --> 01:04:56.000
Like somebody
just drew curtains.

01:04:56.376 --> 01:04:57.805
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:04:57.882 --> 01:04:59.500
Why doesn't he get
any treatment?

01:04:59.577 --> 01:05:00.829
I don't know. I...

01:05:00.906 --> 01:05:02.449
You know, he doesn't
think it'll work.

01:05:02.526 --> 01:05:03.788
The doctors say
it might work.

01:05:03.865 --> 01:05:05.024
Maybe I should have
tried harder.

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.283
I don't know. I don't know.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.207
I just... I don't...
I don't know.

01:05:12.114 --> 01:05:14.300
Can I tell you something awful?

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:16.267
What?

01:05:19.364 --> 01:05:22.374
I used Vik...

01:05:22.657 --> 01:05:24.261
to get over you.

01:05:32.556 --> 01:05:34.412
I mean, I was
so afraid to be alone,

01:05:34.489 --> 01:05:36.008
and he just breezed
into my life,

01:05:36.085 --> 01:05:37.885
and it was so easy.

01:05:37.962 --> 01:05:39.846
He didn't ask anything of me.

01:05:39.923 --> 01:05:41.291
He took care of himself.

01:05:41.368 --> 01:05:42.783
He helped me with the kids.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:44.838
Everything was so much easier,

01:05:44.915 --> 01:05:46.787
and I did not want
to let go of that,

01:05:46.864 --> 01:05:51.943
and now I feel like I wasted
the last years of his life,

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.965
because he could have met
someone who loved him,

01:05:54.042 --> 01:05:55.497
who really loved him,

01:05:55.574 --> 01:05:57.810
who could have brought
her whole self to him,

01:05:57.887 --> 01:05:59.866
not some kind
of fucking broken...

01:05:59.943 --> 01:06:01.664
Stop, okay? Seriously, stop.

01:06:01.741 --> 01:06:03.582
That's enough.

01:06:04.197 --> 01:06:06.957
You are a lot of things,
Helen. You are...

01:06:07.906 --> 01:06:11.135
neurotic
and-and overbearing,

01:06:11.212 --> 01:06:12.241
and you're snobby,

01:06:12.318 --> 01:06:14.877
and you're judgmental
and-and superior, but...

01:06:14.954 --> 01:06:16.344
- Are you gonna stop?
- But you...

01:06:16.421 --> 01:06:19.074
you are not broken.

01:06:19.728 --> 01:06:22.378
I don't know anyone
who's tougher than you.

01:06:26.689 --> 01:06:28.616
That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:30.666
Yeah, well, I mean it.

01:06:30.845 --> 01:06:32.340
And I know you love Vik.

01:06:32.417 --> 01:06:36.241
I-I've been watching you both
for however many years.

01:06:36.318 --> 01:06:38.097
You love each other.

01:06:39.142 --> 01:06:41.063
Maybe it's not the same
as it was with us,

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:42.180
but who gives a fuck?

01:06:42.257 --> 01:06:43.658
Where is it written that love

01:06:43.735 --> 01:06:46.003
should be exactly
the same every time?

01:06:48.243 --> 01:06:49.746
And now he's dying,

01:06:49.823 --> 01:06:52.261
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:06:52.906 --> 01:06:55.355
And I know that that
is terrifying.

01:06:56.615 --> 01:06:59.534
I know that's the worst feeling
in the whole world.

01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:04.433
But I gotta say, I...

01:07:04.642 --> 01:07:07.152
if there's one person
I would want to be with

01:07:07.339 --> 01:07:10.223
when I die,

01:07:10.392 --> 01:07:13.116
if there's one person
who would make me feel,

01:07:13.193 --> 01:07:17.566
no matter what,
that I was safe and...

01:07:17.781 --> 01:07:20.956
that I was loved,

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:23.214
it'd be you.

01:07:31.087 --> 01:07:32.700
Okay, that really is
the nicest thing

01:07:32.777 --> 01:07:34.269
you've ever said to me.

01:07:34.767 --> 01:07:36.489
Helen.

01:07:36.906 --> 01:07:39.284
We are so fucking lucky
to be alive.

01:07:41.845 --> 01:07:44.862
I-I think about this
all the time these days.

01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:47.652
We are just so fucking
lucky to be alive.

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:33.408
That was scary.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.791
Yeah, it was.

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:44.822
I didn't realize
how painful it would get.

01:09:00.906 --> 01:09:03.305
I have to say something to you.

01:09:10.631 --> 01:09:12.774
I'm so sorry.

01:09:14.676 --> 01:09:16.241
For what?

01:09:19.874 --> 01:09:21.947
I should have listened to you.

01:09:25.046 --> 01:09:27.392
I should have gotten treatment.

01:09:28.162 --> 01:09:29.906
I'm sorry.

01:09:31.827 --> 01:09:33.316
I'm so sorry.

01:09:33.393 --> 01:09:35.179
Stop.

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:37.281
We...

01:09:38.662 --> 01:09:40.876
We did the best we could.

01:09:48.705 --> 01:09:50.506
I've seen death.

01:09:53.051 --> 01:09:55.353
I always knew
it was coming. I...

01:09:58.062 --> 01:10:00.249
I thought I knew what it was.

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:06.583
But when it finally
happens to you, you...

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:08.124
you're not ready.

01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:10.572
You're not dead.
You're still here.

01:10:12.148 --> 01:10:14.124
I'm by myself now.

01:10:17.906 --> 01:10:19.116
I'm on the other side.

01:10:19.193 --> 01:10:20.689
Don't say that.

01:10:21.265 --> 01:10:22.958
You're alive.

01:10:23.499 --> 01:10:24.958
And I miss you.

01:10:27.851 --> 01:10:29.593
I just...

01:10:30.052 --> 01:10:32.798
I just want to be back,
where you are.

01:10:34.184 --> 01:10:35.518
With you.

01:10:36.713 --> 01:10:38.264
And the kids.

01:10:40.549 --> 01:10:42.517
I don't want
to do this.

01:10:47.984 --> 01:10:49.791
I don't want to go.

01:10:51.364 --> 01:10:53.532
I want... more days.

01:10:53.609 --> 01:10:55.134
I want more life.

01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:11.782
I love you.

01:11:15.317 --> 01:11:17.036
I love you.

01:11:20.403 --> 01:11:22.156
I love you.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.639
I love you.

01:11:54.726 --> 01:11:56.330
Tell him now.

01:11:56.448 --> 01:11:58.702
What?

01:11:59.335 --> 01:12:01.204
He's awake. Tell him.
