its sweet-ass time.

the GB guys.

Hit me again, Sonny.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.549
How's he holding up?

14:58.593 --> 15:00.508
He's about to think
he's Ethel Merman.

15:00.551 --> 15:02.292
Oh, that leg is gnarly.
Give him an antibiotic yet?

15:02.336 --> 15:03.815
Negative. He left
his medkit out there.

All right.

15:05.513 --> 15:08.908
Hey. All right, my slayer.
You're gonna take this.

15:08.951 --> 15:10.648
-Okay?
-I want food.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.042
-All right. You take this pill.
-I'm hungry, man.

from the last time we were here.

my head was all fucked up.

you need right now.

to change your dressings.

tinnitus, headaches,

22:01.972 --> 22:03.974
even lapses in memory.

you made it through unscathed,

a problem, I'd be working it.

for his life.

22:23.994 --> 22:26.997
I understand
by acknowledging any TBI issues

22:27.041 --> 22:29.217
you'd likely lose your Trident.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.828
But as I told you last time,
if there is a problem,

22:31.872 --> 22:35.049
you need to address it before
the effects become disastrous.

-Any news?

22:54.634 --> 22:56.940
He's still in surgery.

22:56.984 --> 23:00.074
The fact that they moved him
to Germany could be a good sign.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.293
I doubt they would have
transported him

23:02.337 --> 23:04.426
if his condition
was too severe.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.037
Or maybe
his injuries were so bad

23:07.081 --> 23:08.865
that he couldn't be treated
where they were deployed.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.042
I-I can't share where they were.

23:12.086 --> 23:15.959

weren't near optimal facilities.

it ain't a good thing.

relying on us,

24:29.990 --> 24:31.208
so keep it together.

24:31.252 --> 24:33.559
I never did actually, uh,

plan that bachelor party we were
always talking about for Clay.

in my Primetime Perry days.

shouldn't go back there

24:58.366 --> 24:59.759

25:03.893 --> 25:05.199
Go out to wine country...

25:05.242 --> 25:06.330
Oh, please, Brock,
shut your mouth.

25:06.374 --> 25:07.549
Do a spa weekend...

25:07.593 --> 25:08.942
SONNY:
Brock, you make reality

25:08.985 --> 25:10.509
annoying enough,
so whatever you do,

25:10.552 --> 25:11.597
don't fuck up
my delusions, too.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.772
RAY:
Hey.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.556
Why don't you two go find

25:14.600 --> 25:17.298
that, uh, vending machine
of yours, Sonny, and cool off?

25:17.341 --> 25:19.518
Yeah. You mention "babymoon"
one more time

25:19.561 --> 25:21.563
and you'll see what happens.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.739
Gonna rip that little
cotton condom off your head.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.349
[Brock chuckles]

25:27.482 --> 25:30.833
RAY:
Boss. How's that bullet wound?

25:30.877 --> 25:33.532
Lucky I didn't have to dig that
round out with my Leatherman.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.317
Yeah, I'll live.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.538
You sure you didn't get
any bad news in there?

25:41.278 --> 25:43.237
[exhales]

25:47.807 --> 25:50.157
[sighs heavily]

25:52.768 --> 25:56.598
You know, on the way
out to the op,

25:56.642 --> 25:58.382
Clay told me that, uh,
he was stepping down

25:58.426 --> 26:00.602
from Bravo
when he got back home.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.473
Oh.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.609
Uh...

26:07.653 --> 26:10.003
Damn.

26:10.046 --> 26:12.571
Then things go sideways
for him...

26:12.614 --> 26:16.749
Man, that kind of timing leads
to a lifetime of "what ifs."

26:21.667 --> 26:25.627
Don't tell me
Bravo 1 is blaming himself.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.629
This is what you do, Jace:

26:27.673 --> 26:29.283
Adam, Nate,

26:29.326 --> 26:31.328
-hell, even when I got taken--
-[pen clatters]

26:31.372 --> 26:33.635
This is on me.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.768
Clay shouldn't have been
on that op. I fucked up.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.204
[door opens]

26:37.247 --> 26:39.510
Commander, you got
a sitrep on Spenser?

26:39.554 --> 26:42.252
[sighs] He's out of surgery
and resting, Master Chief.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.515
But it's too early to make
any long-term calls.

26:44.559 --> 26:47.388
Well, his leg took the brunt
of those RPG blasts.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.042
Is it salvageable?

26:49.085 --> 26:51.000
Petty Officer Spenser suffered
a compound fracture,

26:51.044 --> 26:53.786
so we're working to repair
the skeletal,

26:53.829 --> 26:57.050
soft tissue, nerve damage
in order to restore function.

26:57.093 --> 27:00.357
But frankly, I'm more concerned
about his internal injuries.

27:00.401 --> 27:04.361
He has a splenic laceration,
causing a surrounding hematoma.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.015
How bad?

27:06.059 --> 27:08.539
We don't know yet
if we have to remove the organ,

27:08.583 --> 27:10.585
but I prefer
my patients to leave

27:10.629 --> 27:12.805
with all the parts
they came in with.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.458
So he's not
out of the woods yet.

27:14.502 --> 27:17.374
He's hypotensive, tachycardic
and his leg wound

27:17.418 --> 27:21.378
was extremely dirty, putting
him at the risk of infection.

27:21.422 --> 27:22.858
Was he administered

27:22.902 --> 27:24.251
a broad-spectrum antibiotic
in the field?

27:24.294 --> 27:26.079
Yeah, he just, uh...
He puked it up.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.778
Understood.

27:29.822 --> 27:32.825
In any event,
the next 48 hours are critical.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.175
[Jason sighs]

27:35.218 --> 27:36.872
[door opens]

27:36.916 --> 27:38.439
[door closes]

27:45.011 --> 27:48.492
Yet another death-defying stunt
by Evel Clay-nievel.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.538
Most of it's a blur.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.107
Anyone tell Stella yet?

27:54.150 --> 27:57.980
We were kind of just waiting,
'cause we didn't know, um,

27:58.024 --> 28:00.853
what type of call
we were gonna have to make.

28:00.896 --> 28:01.941
[whispers]:
Sonny.

28:03.856 --> 28:06.032
How you feeling?

28:07.076 --> 28:10.297
Grateful to you all for
getting me off that battlefield.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.386
Oh, Jason especially.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.257
Bravo 1 made
a dash for the ages.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.477
Well, more like a waddle
with this knee.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.306
Y'all gotta be
pretty banged up, too.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.742
RAY:
Dealing with some burns,

28:20.786 --> 28:23.440
tympanic tears,

28:23.484 --> 28:26.052
respiratory issues from
all the crap we inhaled.

28:26.095 --> 28:28.576
But... we got off easy.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.883
My bell definitely got rung.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.715
Everybody else good?

28:36.758 --> 28:38.760
Don't worry about us, man.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.762
We already got discharged.

28:40.806 --> 28:43.504
[coughing]

28:49.510 --> 28:51.120
[sniffles]

28:56.343 --> 28:57.866
[clears throat]

28:57.910 --> 29:00.434
I want you...
I want you all headed home.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.264
The situation was reversed,

29:04.307 --> 29:06.179
I'd be on the next plane
to see Stella and Brian.

29:06.222 --> 29:08.529
Look, we all came in together,
we all leave together.

29:08.572 --> 29:10.749
[Clay coughing]

29:13.621 --> 29:16.232
I think visiting hour's over.

29:16.276 --> 29:20.976
Christie Brink-Clay needs
his beauty sleep.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.673
RAY:
All right.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.635
CLAY:
Hey, Jace.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.855
Hey, hold-hold up a second, man.

29:31.204 --> 29:32.945
[Clay exhales]

29:32.988 --> 29:34.903
What's on your mind?

29:34.947 --> 29:38.341
I didn't want to say it
in front of the boys,

29:38.385 --> 29:41.780
but I wasn't sure
that I'd pull through here.

29:43.085 --> 29:46.088
Yeah, but you know what?
You did pull through.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.786
You won the fight.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.790
We both know
the battle isn't over.

29:55.097 --> 29:59.058
Docs used a lot of
big words telling me that.

29:59.101 --> 30:00.842
Can't trust anyone

30:00.886 --> 30:03.279
who can't even read their own
handwriting. [chuckles]

30:10.896 --> 30:14.116
We both thought Metal was
in the clear, too, right?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.337
Yeah.

30:19.339 --> 30:21.994
Listen, if this...

30:22.037 --> 30:23.865
if this is how I go,

30:23.909 --> 30:27.913
serving my country
alongside the brothers I love...

30:29.479 --> 30:31.742
...I'm all right with that.

30:36.486 --> 30:38.880
But leaving Stella
and Brian behind...

30:38.924 --> 30:40.403
No. Shh, shh.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.362
Man, it's not gonna
come to that.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.625
But if it does...

30:47.193 --> 30:50.065
...if Stella has
to hear the worst...

30:52.372 --> 30:53.982
...there's nobody
better equipped

30:54.026 --> 30:55.810
to help her
in that moment than you.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.029
[chuckles]

30:57.072 --> 30:59.161
I don't know if that's true.

30:59.205 --> 31:01.468
[breathes deeply]

31:01.511 --> 31:03.209
Look, you've got more experience

31:03.252 --> 31:05.167
in these situations
than anyone.

31:09.171 --> 31:11.957
I want the rest of Bravo
there with her, too.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.353
Look, man.

31:17.397 --> 31:19.573
I'm your team leader.

31:19.616 --> 31:22.706
There's no way in hell
I'm gonna leave you here.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.972
I'm not asking as a teammate.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.539
I'm asking as a friend.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.509
How's Stella holding up?

31:42.552 --> 31:45.686
As expected,
given the situation.

31:45.729 --> 31:48.254
She's in good hands
with Naima, though.

31:48.297 --> 31:51.170
Just figured
I'd be more useful here,

31:51.213 --> 31:53.389
digging into the ambush.

31:53.433 --> 31:56.305
Times of crisis, we cling
to what brings us comfort.

31:56.349 --> 31:59.004
I'm looking for answers,
not comfort.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.006
Answers to what?

32:02.833 --> 32:04.705
You think SGS was able to just

32:04.748 --> 32:06.968
slap together a coordinated
attack like that?

32:07.012 --> 32:09.231
Somebody messed up

32:09.275 --> 32:10.885
and they need
to be held accountable.

32:12.626 --> 32:17.239
Believe me, I am kicking
my own ass on this one, too.

32:17.283 --> 32:19.198
You sure that
chasing down a bogeyman

32:19.241 --> 32:20.939
isn't just a way
to absolve your own guilt?

32:22.549 --> 32:25.508
Paper of yours got you
new access at the Pentagon,

32:25.552 --> 32:27.858
but second-guessing
the decisions on this op

32:27.902 --> 32:30.078
won't win you many friends.

32:31.775 --> 32:36.041
Don't let the anger and the pain
that you're feeling right now

32:36.084 --> 32:38.869
drive you to do something
you'll regret later.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.744
[door closes]

32:44.788 --> 32:46.486
Discharged faster
than last time.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.357
Yeah, but this doesn't feel
like victory.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.011
Look, I don't like
leaving either,

32:50.055 --> 32:51.491
but you know what?

32:51.534 --> 32:53.362
Clay wants us back home
with Stella, so...

32:53.406 --> 32:55.930
we got our orders;
that's what we're gonna do.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.758
When I got blowed up
in Tunisia,

32:57.801 --> 32:59.629
the thought of you guys
with Naima and the kids

32:59.673 --> 33:02.023
definitely provided me comfort.

33:07.724 --> 33:09.335
SONNY:
[clears throat] Look, I wouldn't

33:09.378 --> 33:12.599
do Stella no good
pacing around all anxious-like.

33:12.642 --> 33:15.994
Let me stay and watch over him.
Okay, boss?

33:19.127 --> 33:20.607
Take care of our boy.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.913
Roger that.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.059
[indistinct chatter]

33:38.103 --> 33:40.148
[monitor beeping steadily]

33:51.986 --> 33:54.162
Thought everyone was homebound.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.991
SONNY:
Yeah.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.472
You been out so long
the boys are probably

33:59.515 --> 34:03.389
almost wheels down
in Vah Beach by now.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.435
Miss the flight?

34:07.828 --> 34:10.004
There's no way
I'm leaving my battle-boo.

34:10.048 --> 34:13.442
[chuckles] Besides, the, uh...

34:13.486 --> 34:16.489
the recliner
in the hospital rec room,

34:16.532 --> 34:19.057
it's, uh, very damn comfy.

34:21.102 --> 34:25.324
You know, the... hospital's
gonna evict your squatting ass.

34:25.367 --> 34:28.022
Between my drooling and...
and my night terrors...

34:28.066 --> 34:30.546
[chuckling]:
...I'm pretty sure everyone here

34:30.590 --> 34:32.766
is, uh, is pretty afraid
to talk to me.

34:32.809 --> 34:34.420
[both chuckle]

34:34.463 --> 34:36.030
[coughing]

34:36.074 --> 34:38.293
[quietly]:
Hey. It's all right.

34:38.337 --> 34:41.209
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

34:44.169 --> 34:47.346
Thought you had a flight...

34:47.389 --> 34:49.652
-to go see Leanne coming up.
-Yeah.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.480
You should be with her.

34:51.524 --> 34:53.308
Yeah.

34:54.875 --> 34:58.879
I love that little girl
more than anything,

34:58.922 --> 35:02.317
but there is no way in hell
that I'm leaving your side.

35:02.361 --> 35:06.669
Just like you didn't
adios me in Colombia.

35:06.713 --> 35:10.151
-With that robe on...
-Oh, yeah, that robe.

35:10.195 --> 35:13.067
-Cowboy hat...
-Mm-hmm. [laughs]

35:13.111 --> 35:16.070
That little... that...

35:16.114 --> 35:18.551
that lady holding
onto your arm.

35:18.594 --> 35:19.900
-Oh, yeah.
-She was calling you El Jefe.

35:19.943 --> 35:22.990
El Jefe.
Oh, she was hot. [laughs]

35:24.426 --> 35:26.733
Even those RPG blasts

35:26.776 --> 35:29.127
can't wipe that from my memory.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.477
Yeah.
Knuckle-dragger to the end.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.479
The legacy of Sonny Quinn.

35:35.220 --> 35:38.658
I thought you learned to knock
that knuckle-dragger shit off.

35:38.701 --> 35:42.183
Well, if it walks
like a duck...

35:42.227 --> 35:44.316
talks like a duck...

35:44.359 --> 35:47.536
That's why you turned to Jason

35:47.580 --> 35:49.451
to be there for Stella,
instead of me.

35:51.888 --> 35:55.283
Jace has been there for...

35:55.327 --> 35:58.547
how many Gold Star families?

36:02.856 --> 36:05.728
But if I don't, if I don't
make it out of here...

36:08.253 --> 36:10.559
...you're the one
I want looking over them.

36:13.519 --> 36:16.174
Forever.

36:23.790 --> 36:25.661
I wouldn't entrust anyone else

36:25.705 --> 36:28.403
with the two most important
people in the world to me.

36:28.447 --> 36:29.709
All right, well,
it sure as shit's not happening,

36:29.752 --> 36:31.493
you understand me?

36:31.537 --> 36:33.060
Do you?

36:39.414 --> 36:41.808
Promise, promise that
you'll do that for me.

36:43.157 --> 36:46.247
Yeah, man. All right?
I promise, brother.

36:46.291 --> 36:48.031
[phone buzzing]

36:48.075 --> 36:49.729
I give you my word.

36:49.772 --> 36:51.600
[phone continues buzzing]

36:58.216 --> 37:01.871
It's, uh, it's Stella.
She's trying to FaceTime me.

37:01.915 --> 37:04.744
You got enough energy for it?

37:07.486 --> 37:09.923
Hey, Stella,
hold-hold on one second here.

37:09.966 --> 37:12.404
-Which way?
-I got him right here.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.058
-Oh, my God, baby!
-CLAY: Hey, babe.

37:15.102 --> 37:17.147
-[Stella crying]
-Hey.

37:18.584 --> 37:20.803
Are you okay?
What's happening?

37:20.847 --> 37:22.327
I'm fine.

37:23.632 --> 37:25.765
[coughs] I'm fine, baby.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.463
I can't believe I'm talking
to you. I thought that...

37:30.073 --> 37:33.251
I didn't know what to think.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.601
Don't worry, all right?

37:35.644 --> 37:38.125
I'll be with you
and Brian in no time.

37:38.168 --> 37:39.779
[Stella sniffles]

37:40.997 --> 37:42.042
Okay.

37:44.697 --> 37:47.352
[coughing]

37:48.527 --> 37:50.572
