WEBVTT

00:27.274 --> 00:28.662
Well, just great!

00:28.742 --> 00:33.216
No, not the presentation.
That's terrible. Some idiot just hit me.

00:34.294 --> 00:37.004
Do you realize how much
this is going to cost?

00:37.084 --> 00:40.786
Not in money,
which I have plenty of, but in...

00:42.356 --> 00:44.007
What the...

00:44.392 --> 00:47.127
Get away from me! Get away!

00:52.631 --> 00:54.867
Help me. Someone help!

00:57.369 --> 00:59.204
Stay away!

00:59.740 --> 01:01.493
What are you doing?

01:10.719 --> 01:11.853
Look out!

01:23.964 --> 01:27.268
Wonder Woman! Save me! Save me from them!

01:27.835 --> 01:29.708
- From whom?
- Demons.

01:29.788 --> 01:31.739
They're everywhere. Don't you see them?

01:41.982 --> 01:44.197
I see only one.

01:53.127 --> 01:55.529
I'll ask you one last time.

01:55.997 --> 01:58.232
What did you do with my family?

01:59.032 --> 02:01.933
Steven, it's me, Gloria!

02:02.350 --> 02:04.308
I'm your wife.

02:04.388 --> 02:06.476
These are our children.

02:08.341 --> 02:12.900
You're not my family!
You killed them, just like the others.

02:12.980 --> 02:15.249
Now it's your turn.

02:20.321 --> 02:24.245
- No one's dying here tonight.
- It's not me you should be stopping.

02:24.325 --> 02:26.995
It's them. Look at them!

02:29.997 --> 02:31.533
Look at them!

02:38.139 --> 02:42.646
It's just like the neighbors.
Go to my shed. You'll see I'm right!

03:00.695 --> 03:02.732
What have you done?

03:27.421 --> 03:29.259
Let me help you.

03:30.226 --> 03:32.247
It's not my fault.

03:32.327 --> 03:36.399
I've given birth to the devil.
It's the devil!

03:38.666 --> 03:40.956
You're tired. Give me the baby.

03:41.036 --> 03:43.273
You don't want to hurt her.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.059
I'm sorry.

04:47.169 --> 04:50.360
These crimes were committed
by law-abiding citizens.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.430
They all claim to have seen
nightmare visions beforehand.

04:53.510 --> 04:56.197
- Any clue what's causing it?
- No idea.

04:57.414 --> 05:00.603
The one week I fill in for Jordan,
and it couldn't be some hairy-ass monster?

05:00.683 --> 05:03.640
The same pattern is repeating
around the world,

05:03.720 --> 05:05.674
so there could be an overriding factor.

05:05.754 --> 05:07.778
Perhaps a paranormal element.

05:07.858 --> 05:10.013
Are you talking about magic?

05:10.693 --> 05:12.915
We've come up against
magic before, Batman.

05:12.995 --> 05:17.486
- Xerxes, Trigon, Felix Faust.
- Even Shazam's powers are based in magic.

05:17.566 --> 05:20.038
With as much as you've seen,
can you rule it out?

05:20.118 --> 05:23.677
The criminally insane
don't need magic as an excuse.

05:23.757 --> 05:28.030
I recommend spending more time
on the streets instead of flying over them.

05:30.746 --> 05:33.017
He's even friendlier than they say.

06:54.833 --> 06:59.907
Bollocks! In what bloody plane of
existence does four of a kind lose?

07:00.738 --> 07:04.810
Too, too bad, Constantine.

07:05.776 --> 07:10.147
Have you gained weight?
It looks good on you.

07:10.447 --> 07:13.304
What say you let your soul mate
play a few hands, Jason?

07:13.384 --> 07:16.840
Maybe he'd change my luck.
He'd definitely be less mopey than you.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.778
John Constantine, the man
who perfected the bad idea.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.543
The only reason I came
to this dung heap of a casino

07:24.623 --> 07:27.651
is to find a relic to keep
that monster locked away forever.

07:27.731 --> 07:31.838
Boys, boys! You're boring me.
Let's play, shall we?

07:49.588 --> 07:52.610
My luck's running
as hot as me naughty bits.

07:53.590 --> 07:58.982
But our next group of friends is due
to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.

07:59.062 --> 08:02.452
Copperfield's coming. Presto changeo!

08:02.532 --> 08:05.723
Woman in a box. In a box.

08:05.803 --> 08:09.160
Yeah, he's classy, unlike you.

08:09.240 --> 08:13.947
Are they implying David Copperfield,
television magician, has true power?

08:14.027 --> 08:18.801
Owns a chain of islands and dated
Claudia Schiffer. What do you think?

08:21.753 --> 08:24.341
No cards for me, and...

08:24.421 --> 08:27.513
Looks like you can't call
my bet, Constantine.

08:27.593 --> 08:30.316
By my rules, you lose.

08:30.396 --> 08:32.852
- I raise.
- With what?

08:32.933 --> 08:37.169
- Your ratty soul ain't worth two bits.
- Not two bits.

08:37.804 --> 08:41.885
I'm betting the House,
the House of Mystery.

08:47.647 --> 08:50.475
And since I'm including everything inside,
it looks like you're the one

08:50.555 --> 08:52.952
that can't call, Abnegazar.

08:53.552 --> 08:55.608
Well, what do you say, boys?

08:55.688 --> 08:57.996
I like the action.

09:12.608 --> 09:14.058
I call.

09:18.611 --> 09:21.400
Really? A chipped Dreamstone?

09:21.480 --> 09:23.336
I'm out.

09:24.016 --> 09:27.824
Broken knick-knacks for the House of
Mystery and its contents? Are you mad?

09:27.904 --> 09:31.374
I've got a working soul catcher.

09:31.455 --> 09:34.516
That's Ogid's Eye Spiker?

09:34.596 --> 09:35.941
And the Garazi.

09:36.021 --> 09:41.036
So even if that very magical Dreamstone
doesn't work, it's still a big-ass ruby.

09:42.066 --> 09:46.107
I'd be a poor sport indeed
if I didn't accept your fair wager.

09:53.646 --> 09:57.035
Hell. Now, that's
a losing hand for the ages.

09:57.115 --> 10:00.405
Now, read them and...

10:00.821 --> 10:04.325
- What?
- Do they have an eye doctor in hell?

10:04.406 --> 10:08.541
- I'd make an appointment if I was you.
- You cheated!

10:11.864 --> 10:14.987
Technically, we both cheated.
I just did it better.

10:15.217 --> 10:19.140
- I'll rip your bloody heart out!
- Sorry, mate, I'm using that.

10:36.407 --> 10:39.696
Situation here, Jason.
It's time to call your better half.

10:39.776 --> 10:42.967
Sorry, John, you're on your own.

10:52.088 --> 10:56.495
Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts
and feed them to you, Constantine.

11:04.267 --> 11:07.289
Gone, gone, the form of man.

11:07.369 --> 11:10.776
Arise the demon, Etrigan!

11:14.211 --> 11:17.835
Once more with words of metered rhyme

11:17.915 --> 11:21.573
comes Etrigan the Slayer just in time.

11:21.653 --> 11:25.176
Easy now, brother.
We're on the same side, right?

11:25.256 --> 11:27.612
Let's use our words.

11:28.092 --> 11:30.981
Are you having a laugh?
We're the Demons Three.

11:31.061 --> 11:33.064
Kill everyone!

11:42.939 --> 11:45.063
You will pay, Constantine.

11:45.143 --> 11:47.599
Your soul will be ours.

11:47.679 --> 11:49.915
Get in line, you prats.

12:01.424 --> 12:03.747
Your ass is grass, Constantine.

12:03.827 --> 12:07.065
And we're the lawnmower.

12:08.264 --> 12:10.921
Since the battle's fought and won,

12:11.001 --> 12:14.540
Jason Blood with me is done.

12:24.214 --> 12:27.071
For 500 years, I've been bound to Etrigan,

12:27.151 --> 12:31.408
fighting to keep him from coming forth,
and you forced me to summon him.

12:31.488 --> 12:33.561
Everything got sorted.

12:33.641 --> 12:37.272
He could have gone on a killing spree.
You don't think.

12:37.352 --> 12:40.269
- You don't consider the cost.
- Yeah, I did.

12:40.349 --> 12:44.470
Weighed it against my being eaten alive
and thought, "Yeah, totally worth it."

12:46.705 --> 12:49.293
You're a world class bastard, John.

13:16.534 --> 13:23.417
And for my finale, I will make this
terrible trio of terrifying Tantors

13:23.497 --> 13:25.911
vanish before your eyes.

13:51.904 --> 13:54.125
I hope those elephants survived.

13:54.705 --> 13:56.929
You don't want PETA on your back.

13:57.009 --> 13:59.513
You're assuming they were real
in the first place.

14:01.479 --> 14:05.604
- How are you, Bruce?
- I'm fine, Zatanna. Busy.

14:05.684 --> 14:08.708
You know where I can find
John Constantine?

14:08.788 --> 14:11.327
- No.
- You must have some idea.

14:11.407 --> 14:13.512
We don't keep in touch.

14:13.592 --> 14:16.195
I know you two have history, so I...

14:20.265 --> 14:22.655
Z, Batman needs to talk with John.

14:22.735 --> 14:24.824
You've got to come along, too.
It's important.

14:24.904 --> 14:27.593
- Is that you, Boston?
- Yeah.

14:27.673 --> 14:31.545
Everything is...
Boy, this guy's mind is tough.

14:32.309 --> 14:34.332
Can't hold...

14:38.049 --> 14:40.139
What is going on?

14:40.219 --> 14:42.823
I'll tell you on the way to John's.

14:44.006 --> 14:46.076
Okay, but I call shotgun.

14:50.862 --> 14:52.752
I don't even think
his kid could fit back here.

14:52.832 --> 14:55.121
Sorry, Boston, but life is for the living.

14:55.201 --> 14:58.122
Boston Brand. He was a circus performer.

14:58.202 --> 15:02.660
Batman's heard of me. Sweet.
Tell him I'm a fan of his, too,

15:02.740 --> 15:05.233
but, you know, be cool about it.

15:05.313 --> 15:09.102
- Yeah, that's him.
- Ask him if he caught one of my shows.

15:09.182 --> 15:14.172
He was a trapeze artist who loved being
famous, especially with the ladies.

15:14.352 --> 15:17.477
- Husbands, not so much.
- You're killing me.

15:17.557 --> 15:20.279
He had a knack for irritating
the wrong people.

15:20.359 --> 15:24.463
<i>Then, about five years ago,
karma caught up with him.</i>

15:28.099 --> 15:31.223
<i>It was a weekend show, full house.</i>

15:31.303 --> 15:35.776
<i>Boston was in the middle
of his death-defying act when...</i>

16:02.101 --> 16:04.992
<i>he died, and that should have been that,</i>

16:05.072 --> 16:08.930
<i>but with Boston,
things tend to get complicated.</i>

16:09.810 --> 16:13.834
<i>His spirit was called
by the goddess Rama Kushna.</i>

16:15.214 --> 16:19.205
<i>She took pity on him and gave him
the power to possess the living,</i>

16:19.285 --> 16:22.041
so he could bring his killer
and others to justice.

16:22.121 --> 16:24.178
Hey, I don't wanna brag, but I'm good.

16:24.258 --> 16:27.419
Why did he feel the need
to write on my walls like a child?

16:27.499 --> 16:29.330
Yeah, he's sorry about that.

16:31.463 --> 16:35.889
Where is this address? GPS doesn't
seem especially useful tonight.

16:35.969 --> 16:40.294
It's not an address. The House
of Mystery tends to move around.

16:40.374 --> 16:44.398
I didn't put the symbols in there
for the GPS to find it.

16:44.478 --> 16:46.301
I wanted the House to come to us.

17:39.901 --> 17:42.405
She can't hold it. Do something.

18:00.112 --> 18:01.057
There.

18:07.928 --> 18:09.965
Into the House!

18:21.610 --> 18:25.433
- Z, you all right?
- Yeah, as soon as you get off me.

18:25.913 --> 18:29.705
I should have known you were the reason
I'm not back in London enjoying a pint.

18:29.785 --> 18:32.574
The House always did like you better.

18:32.654 --> 18:36.278
Odd trio for a road trip.
To what do I owe the visit?

18:36.408 --> 18:40.354
The League thinks that a recent spike
in homicides may have a magical cause.

18:43.332 --> 18:48.222
Told you something stinks. Now we know
someone doesn't want us asking questions.

18:48.302 --> 18:50.692
Looks like you've cracked it
wide open, mate.

18:50.772 --> 18:52.360
What did he say?

18:52.440 --> 18:55.178
I'm not playing telephone between you two.

18:58.513 --> 19:00.351
We online?

19:01.282 --> 19:05.873
Great. Sorry about the Batmobile.
I hope your insurance was paid up.

19:06.353 --> 19:09.090
What, is there even a policy
for something like that?

19:11.460 --> 19:14.784
Hey, I told you not to do that, Orchid.
Use a bloody door.

19:15.264 --> 19:17.600
I am glad to see you are well.

19:19.801 --> 19:23.559
- How new is this one?
- Not what you think.

19:23.639 --> 19:25.560
It's the magic of the House.

19:25.640 --> 19:29.764
Decided it wanted to experience
humanity and gave itself a body.

19:29.844 --> 19:31.882
It sure did.

19:32.547 --> 19:37.606
A spirit whose existence
is not its own, like myself.

19:38.286 --> 19:40.123
Interesting.

19:41.754 --> 19:45.146
Yeah, we are that.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.851
Dead smooth you are, mate.

19:48.131 --> 19:50.936
Hey, it's been a while, you know?

19:53.202 --> 19:57.966
Powerful in true magic. Angry at John.

19:58.308 --> 20:00.730
This, I understand.

20:01.310 --> 20:05.269
Yet you still have feelings for him.

20:06.132 --> 20:08.003
I could kill him.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.646
You exude pain.

20:17.726 --> 20:22.285
Your life is a patchwork of blackness
with no time for joy.

20:22.865 --> 20:25.137
How do you cope with it?

20:26.769 --> 20:29.040
I have a butler.

20:31.973 --> 20:34.011
That was enlightening.

20:37.346 --> 20:40.418
Well, I guess we should have
that chinwag about now.

20:43.151 --> 20:45.889
- <i>Demons!</i>
- <i>It's not me!</i>

20:47.257 --> 20:50.445
<i>I've given birth to the devil. It's the...</i>

20:50.925 --> 20:53.934
Rama Kushna says this will break down
the walls between the planes.

20:54.014 --> 20:56.019
Even the afterlife will be affected.

20:56.099 --> 20:59.354
Yeah, it's dodgy, all right.
I'll look into it.

20:59.434 --> 21:02.458
Meanwhile, the House
will drop you wherever you'd like.

21:03.038 --> 21:06.729
Rama says we have to work together.
Come on! It's a dream team.

21:06.809 --> 21:10.099
You, me, Zatanna, Batman,
maybe even the Justice League.

21:10.179 --> 21:14.470
The capes and tights crew,
useless against dark magic.

21:14.550 --> 21:17.874
That's why we need you. You can lead us.

21:17.954 --> 21:22.579
Boston, do I strike you as a team player?
Much less a team leader.

21:22.659 --> 21:25.816
Point is, even deities can get it wrong.

21:25.896 --> 21:29.385
It's how we got the appendix,
Neanderthals and reality TV.

21:29.465 --> 21:31.589
Z, your help I could use.

21:31.669 --> 21:34.558
Okay, if we do it as a group.

21:36.038 --> 21:40.296
This is the monkey cage
in Sumatra all over again.

21:40.376 --> 21:42.516
"We need to save the monkeys," she said.

21:42.596 --> 21:46.404
- You're such an ass.
- Not the monkeys.

21:46.484 --> 21:51.008
Says the man who has Newcastle
and 100 other screw-ups on his resume,

21:51.088 --> 21:54.560
- costing lives and souls.
- But not monkeys.

21:54.640 --> 21:57.281
- You're still way ahead on dead monkeys.
- They used to be a thing.

21:57.361 --> 22:00.365
- You just have to make things...
- We're wasting time.

22:01.497 --> 22:05.263
He's dead, and I accept the risks,
so can we get to it,

22:05.343 --> 22:07.973
or do you two need a timeout?

22:10.474 --> 22:14.013
Fine and dandy. Let's take a walk
on the dark side then.

22:17.848 --> 22:19.885
Coming, team?

22:25.321 --> 22:29.213
Stop being a child and slow down.
Where are we going?

22:29.293 --> 22:32.265
- Ritchie's.
- Have you talked to him lately?

22:32.345 --> 22:35.218
I know he's pissed.
You don't have to remind me, love.

22:35.298 --> 22:40.139
- It's on my CV, remember?
- No, really, has he told you...

22:41.707 --> 22:44.847
No. He's dying.

22:44.927 --> 22:47.565
John Constantine,

22:47.645 --> 22:53.304
purveyor of the dark arts
and lifeline of last resort.

22:53.784 --> 22:59.676
No matter. Your friend's soul
will be collected,

22:59.756 --> 23:03.864
and there's nothing
you can do to alter that.

23:03.944 --> 23:07.851
Why don't you go do something
useful, like haunt a house?

23:07.931 --> 23:12.839
- Who's he talking to now?
- Shrouds. They deliver souls to hell.

23:14.906 --> 23:16.962
They're drawn to you.

23:17.442 --> 23:19.932
Maybe it's your cologne, Batsy.

23:20.612 --> 23:24.142
This one has cheated us many times.

23:24.382 --> 23:26.903
It is vexing.

23:32.223 --> 23:35.612
This has been lovely,
but it's time for you lot to bugger off.

23:35.992 --> 23:42.387
When the time comes, I'll be the one
to collect your soul, Constantine.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.504
Yeah, yeah.

23:46.804 --> 23:50.329
I thought I felt
a disturbance in the force.

23:51.708 --> 23:54.046
How you doing, Johnny boy?

23:54.546 --> 23:58.905
Zatanna and Batman?

23:59.984 --> 24:02.139
What the hell?

24:02.519 --> 24:04.944
Tell you everything inside, mate.

24:12.964 --> 24:14.820
You poor thing.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.156
Yeah, I may have lied
the last time we talked,

24:18.236 --> 24:22.059
about exactly how fast
I'm sledding downhill.

24:22.139 --> 24:24.244
I'm sorry about that.

24:25.311 --> 24:27.533
But it means a lot you're here, John.

24:27.613 --> 24:32.138
And, hey, you don't have
to say it. You're forgiven.

24:32.818 --> 24:35.541
Still wondering what Batman's
doing in my living room.

24:35.621 --> 24:38.958
And when is he gonna shut up, right?

24:39.991 --> 24:42.796
What? What's with the face?

24:44.062 --> 24:46.617
You're not here to say
you're sorry, are you?

24:46.697 --> 24:51.740
Of course I am, but I was looking
to borrow the Keshanti Key as well.

24:51.820 --> 24:54.560
Unbelievable.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.430
- I tried to tell him on the way.
- Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.

24:58.510 --> 25:01.934
Just like everything,
this is rock star Johnny's fault.

25:02.014 --> 25:05.738
I was with you when it happened,
Ritchie. We were side by side.

25:05.818 --> 25:08.006
Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side.

25:08.086 --> 25:11.583
But I got the weird
magical cancer while you,

25:11.663 --> 25:13.739
you added to your rep. Isn't that right?

25:13.819 --> 25:17.216
Look, me not making proper amends
isn't related to the Key,

25:17.296 --> 25:20.303
which, truth be told,
you're not gonna need, mate.

25:20.383 --> 25:22.102
John!

25:27.672 --> 25:29.477
Getting that a lot lately.

25:29.557 --> 25:32.832
You can go screw yourself.
I am not giving you crap.

25:32.912 --> 25:35.769
Your anger is understandable,
but you need to reconsider.

25:35.849 --> 25:38.287
Innocent lives are at stake.

25:49.595 --> 25:52.951
Well, doctors say
an upbeat attitude can help,

25:53.031 --> 25:57.758
so what I'll focus on today
is that I met Batman.

25:57.838 --> 26:02.495
Force of good.
It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.

26:02.975 --> 26:05.379
Now, if you'll excuse me...

26:08.915 --> 26:11.252
You can show yourselves out.

26:35.375 --> 26:36.712
This him?

26:38.511 --> 26:42.351
Father of the year.
I'll need the gear now.

26:44.883 --> 26:48.107
- How does this work?
- It's basically a magical shortcut.

26:48.187 --> 26:50.144
It lets me access
different planes of existence

26:50.224 --> 26:52.611
without doing 20-odd hours
of incantations.

26:52.691 --> 26:53.884
In this case,

26:53.964 --> 26:57.936
I'll poke around this poor sod's memories
to see how his madness began.

27:00.001 --> 27:02.753
And, more importantly, what caused it.

27:04.905 --> 27:08.144
What are you doing here?
I'm calling security.

27:10.544 --> 27:13.750
I'll make sure the looky-loos
stay out of our hair.

27:15.215 --> 27:18.922
Z, give me a psychic shout
if this body comes under attack.

27:19.002 --> 27:20.675
Wouldn't do to be trapped inside, now.

27:20.755 --> 27:24.194
Wouldn't do to go in alone,
and since I'm right here...

27:24.274 --> 27:27.464
Too dangerous.
You're out of practice, love.

27:27.544 --> 27:30.284
Look, you wanted me along. I'm here.

27:30.364 --> 27:33.802
I'm not waiting in the wings.
Let's do this.

28:00.127 --> 28:02.316
Z? You okay?

28:02.396 --> 28:04.054
I'm fine.

28:10.003 --> 28:12.793
I've never liked this sort of magic.

28:12.873 --> 28:15.596
I can feel darkness seeping inside me.

28:15.976 --> 28:18.348
How you stand it is beyond me.

28:18.428 --> 28:22.270
It's all about control.
If you ever need a refresher...

28:22.350 --> 28:25.990
We've had this conversation.
I haven't changed my mind.

28:28.990 --> 28:31.947
Sure, sit out the war
between good and evil.

28:32.027 --> 28:35.484
After all, you've got a good thing going
being applauded by mindless twits.

28:35.564 --> 28:37.652
Really? Now?

28:37.732 --> 28:39.404
Good a time as ever, I reckon.

28:39.484 --> 28:42.674
- I'll teach you to talk back.
- No!

28:43.304 --> 28:46.761
The magic I perform
brings people happiness.

28:46.841 --> 28:49.031
You sure it's not
the two drink minimum, love?

28:49.111 --> 28:50.799
You're such a pessimist.

28:50.879 --> 28:53.363
Wrong. I expect the worst,

28:53.443 --> 28:57.304
so I prepare for the worst,
and when the worst happens, I'm ready.

28:57.384 --> 29:00.541
But my outlook doesn't alter
the reality of the world.

29:00.621 --> 29:03.611
- <i>Steven, stop!</i>
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>

29:03.891 --> 29:06.214
Another precious moment.

29:06.294 --> 29:08.449
There was joy, too.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.833
His madness swept it away.

29:50.405 --> 29:52.409
Who dropped the bed pan?

30:26.442 --> 30:29.165
This is it.
This was the morning of his madness.

30:29.245 --> 30:32.634
- What do you think will set him off?
- My guess is the Sudoku.

30:32.714 --> 30:35.104
He's got two 9s in the same row.

30:35.184 --> 30:36.853
John.

30:46.394 --> 30:49.384
Run! Run! Run!

30:49.864 --> 30:52.769
Run! Let's get out of here!

30:57.239 --> 31:00.477
Come on, fellow. Eat a piece of fruit?

32:09.914 --> 32:11.749
Here it is.

32:19.089 --> 32:21.093
We've got to get out of here.

32:22.758 --> 32:24.615
One more second.

32:26.864 --> 32:28.801
Now, John. There's no time.

32:35.539 --> 32:37.409
Got it.

33:01.831 --> 33:05.456
- Shit's really hit the fan.
- You had to go there, Boston.

33:06.036 --> 33:08.040
Let's get the hell out of here.

33:18.182 --> 33:20.904
- I don't recognize it.
- Me, neither.

33:20.984 --> 33:23.674
But if there's a person alive
who can, it's Ritchie.

33:23.754 --> 33:26.676
Are you forgetting when you made
your friend despise you?

33:26.756 --> 33:29.295
This is too bloody important
for hurt feelings.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.556
- Constantine.
- Bollocks.

33:38.936 --> 33:41.640
You've arrived in time to witness my...

33:43.240 --> 33:45.077
Ritchie!

33:48.813 --> 33:50.568
Get back, you bastards!

33:50.648 --> 33:52.918
John, help Ritchie.

33:55.318 --> 33:56.923
Take that! Boom!

33:57.121 --> 34:01.026
- No pulse.
- We know! We know! Come on!

34:16.440 --> 34:17.563
Why?

34:22.847 --> 34:25.235
I see you have a few tricks of your own?

34:25.315 --> 34:27.587
Not everything requires magic.

34:43.668 --> 34:46.157
Make sure he sees that
right when he wakes up.

34:46.237 --> 34:48.007
If he wakes.

34:50.743 --> 34:54.900
We need to talk, you and I,
but if you try and summon Etrigan,

34:54.980 --> 34:58.705
I'll fill your lungs with bile
before the first verse is done.

34:58.785 --> 34:59.991
Savvy?

35:07.659 --> 35:10.047
The situation was not how it seemed.

35:10.127 --> 35:14.101
The apartment was like that
when I arrived. Richard as well.

35:14.181 --> 35:17.689
- Come on! You were all over him.
- I was attempting to help.

35:17.769 --> 35:21.175
When you burst in,
I knew I'd get blamed, so I ran.

35:21.255 --> 35:24.763
- Do you believe him?
- Jason's not the murdery type.

35:24.843 --> 35:28.601
He's chock full of honor, loyalty,
and rubbish of that sort.

35:28.681 --> 35:31.085
Then tell us why you were there.

35:32.134 --> 35:35.858
Richard is known as a collector
of the arcane and supernatural.

35:35.938 --> 35:40.230
I wanted to see if he had something
that could gain me access to this place.

35:40.460 --> 35:42.764
Why would you wanna break in here?

35:43.964 --> 35:45.419
For this.

35:45.499 --> 35:49.939
The single most powerful conduit
of evil in the history of the world.

35:50.019 --> 35:52.676
He named it the Dreamstone.

35:53.106 --> 35:56.043
But it's really the stuff of nightmares.

35:58.745 --> 36:01.367
<i>I was a young knight, green as grass.</i>

36:01.447 --> 36:05.404
<i>With visions of battle-won glory
dancing in my head.</i>

36:05.484 --> 36:09.925
<i>Needless to say,
these were dispelled thoroughly.</i>

36:11.190 --> 36:13.443
<i>He called himself Destiny,</i>

36:13.943 --> 36:17.384
<i>but Merlin told us he
was a man of science one time,</i>

36:17.464 --> 36:19.499
<i>before he went insane.</i>

36:19.699 --> 36:23.789
<i>Destiny forged the Dreamstone
with black magic and his soul.</i>

36:23.869 --> 36:27.560
<i>He used it to subject people
to their most terrifying nightmares</i>

36:27.640 --> 36:30.112
<i>and then feed off their torment.</i>

37:41.714 --> 37:45.221
<i>It was actually the demon Etrigan
who won the day.</i>

37:47.655 --> 37:52.812
To battle, Etrigan. Should you succeed,
I will release you of your bond to me.

37:53.242 --> 37:55.765
If freedom is what's up for trade,

37:55.845 --> 37:59.117
then Destiny's as good as slayed.

38:33.100 --> 38:36.575
You haven't won, Merlin. This isn't over.

38:36.655 --> 38:38.858
I swear it.

38:50.318 --> 38:52.941
Release me, Merlin, from your care.

38:53.021 --> 38:56.695
My duty's done. 'Tis only fair.

38:56.775 --> 39:00.912
I'm afraid that's not possible,
friend Demon.

39:06.767 --> 39:10.325
I apologize to both you and Jason Blood,

39:10.405 --> 39:14.878
but your future portends a shared destiny.

39:17.378 --> 39:22.304
Caught now, imprisoned in the form of man.

39:22.916 --> 39:26.855
I fix the demon, Etrigan.

39:38.366 --> 39:43.035
<i>It was also the beginning
of my eternal life sentence with Etrigan.</i>

39:47.975 --> 39:49.932
I didn't think you'd give it up willingly,

39:50.012 --> 39:55.086
and though this piece is useless without
the other half, it's far from powerless.

39:55.567 --> 39:56.856
Safe enough where it is.

39:56.936 --> 40:01.007
Displayed like a tourist trinket
in a Karachi bazaar?

40:02.424 --> 40:03.724
Neat, isn't it?

40:03.804 --> 40:07.741
The House keeps my valuables out of phase,
so they don't go wondering off.

40:07.821 --> 40:10.433
But, still, the timing
of the Stone's appearance and its power

40:10.513 --> 40:13.188
indicates that it's somehow
involved with these crimes.

40:13.268 --> 40:17.045
Which is why it stays here,
where only I can get to it.

40:17.255 --> 40:19.434
I think me, them,
and everyone else who knows you

40:19.514 --> 40:21.645
might want it to be somewhere else.

40:22.810 --> 40:25.615
Your friend is awake.

40:27.649 --> 40:30.955
Ritchie, who was it? Who did this to you?

40:31.270 --> 40:33.079
Faust.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.494
Felix Faust. You sure?

40:50.205 --> 40:51.910
There you are, you old bastard.

40:51.990 --> 40:56.865
I give you wizard and asshole
extraordinaire, Felix Faust.

40:56.945 --> 41:01.218
Hell, I should have put it together.
Conjuring a whirlwind is just his style.

41:03.384 --> 41:06.876
The League had a run-in with Faust,
but his location isn't in our database.

41:07.156 --> 41:11.647
Yeah, wizards don't make a habit of
signing up for credit cards or social media.

41:11.727 --> 41:13.993
His grandly named Observatory
of the Cosmos

41:14.074 --> 41:17.636
is hidden from the likes of you
and Superman, but not from me.

41:21.337 --> 41:23.374
Felix Faust.

41:33.949 --> 41:36.075
- What's happening?
- If this were a computer,

41:36.155 --> 41:37.789
I'd say it's frozen.

41:38.488 --> 41:39.875
Cheers.

41:39.955 --> 41:44.280
Felix Faust would take precautions
against locator spells.

41:44.360 --> 41:45.916
There's another way,

41:45.996 --> 41:50.454
but it involves asking a favor of someone
that I don't have the best relationship with.

41:50.534 --> 41:53.556
Someone else dislikes you? Shocking.

41:53.836 --> 41:56.326
Your friend slips from the mortal plane.

41:56.406 --> 41:59.963
- John...
- Keep him alive and safe. Understand?

42:00.043 --> 42:01.898
That is not my purpose.

42:01.978 --> 42:05.201
I don't give a flying shag
what you think your bloody purpose is.

42:05.281 --> 42:08.186
I order you to help him
any and every way you're able.

42:11.922 --> 42:13.692
Let's go.

42:16.793 --> 42:18.882
All right, I'll ask.

42:18.962 --> 42:22.251
Why are we in the middle
of a godforsaken swamp?

42:22.331 --> 42:26.022
It's a favorite hidey hole
of one Alec Holland,

42:26.102 --> 42:29.858
whose corpse was taken to be
the most recent Avatar of the Green.

42:29.938 --> 42:32.028
Bet you won't find that
on your bloody cell phone.

42:32.108 --> 42:35.409
Our data's more factual.
Alec Holland was murdered by terrorists.

42:35.489 --> 42:38.368
His body was never recovered.
End of story.

42:38.448 --> 42:40.253
Not quite.

42:43.854 --> 42:47.527
Go away!

42:58.269 --> 43:00.391
Swamp Thing!

43:00.471 --> 43:04.878
I know you're seeing this.
Get out here, or the posies get it!

43:17.454 --> 43:20.326
John Constantine.

43:21.459 --> 43:24.897
You dare threaten the green.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.424
Dude, your social skills are horrendous.

43:34.204 --> 43:38.446
Please, we aren't here to harm
any plants, but our need is urgent.

43:38.526 --> 43:41.917
Don't let your feelings for John
stop you from doing what's right.

43:45.816 --> 43:48.738
You have a garden.

43:48.818 --> 43:52.202
Yes, I find it relaxing,

43:52.282 --> 43:54.677
and I water it every week.

43:54.925 --> 43:59.482
We need to find a man,
a wizard named Felix Faust.

43:59.562 --> 44:04.153
A single human among your teeming masses.

44:04.233 --> 44:09.142
I only know John Constantine
because he enrages me.

44:13.245 --> 44:16.001
Faust lives in an observatory
which is invisible.

44:16.081 --> 44:19.905
It's a place where dark magic
would infect the earth below it.

44:20.485 --> 44:25.492
I will take you there
so you are no longer here.

44:39.437 --> 44:43.243
The place you seek is there.

44:55.821 --> 44:58.224
That place is heavily warded.

45:02.243 --> 45:05.933
I know we've had our differences,
but we could really use your help.

45:06.013 --> 45:10.154
If we don't get a handle on this rotter,
he'll threaten all of humanity.

45:11.136 --> 45:13.092
What of it?

45:13.672 --> 45:16.911
You were once human, just like me.

45:18.710 --> 45:20.498
No longer.

45:20.578 --> 45:23.867
Perhaps his actions are a kind of justice,

45:24.347 --> 45:29.389
for who destroys more
of the green than your kind?

45:34.860 --> 45:37.451
And Swamp Thing has left the building.

45:37.531 --> 45:40.767
- Guess we do it the hard way.
- Or not.

45:40.847 --> 45:44.297
Gone, gone, the form of man.

45:44.437 --> 45:48.476
Arise the demon Etrigan!

46:10.964 --> 46:12.734
What...

46:15.500 --> 46:20.292
- Who dares?
- I, Etrigan, bring down this house

46:20.372 --> 46:23.311
and build a tomb for Felix Faust!

46:28.914 --> 46:31.403
As if I would stoop
to brawling with a demon.

46:31.483 --> 46:33.921
Fight others of your filthy kind.

46:44.963 --> 46:49.386
From hell though we may be,
it does not make us family!

47:09.923 --> 47:12.346
Do you like what I've done with the place?

47:12.426 --> 47:15.464
No woman can speak
in my sanctum sanctorum.

47:15.544 --> 47:20.050
I conjured it just for you
and, of course, men everywhere.

47:33.279 --> 47:37.692
As a fellow showman, this is no way
to treat your guests. Now, settle down!

47:45.625 --> 47:48.982
Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting
yourself. Stop hitting yourself.

47:50.262 --> 47:53.467
Not everything can be solved
with your peashooter.

47:57.204 --> 48:02.712
Just because you're dead doesn't
mean you're beyond my retribution.

48:15.355 --> 48:16.831
Is that it?

48:16.911 --> 48:21.796
Well, it's off to the old magicians home
for you, mate. Pudding night is Thursday.

48:31.806 --> 48:36.597
Try that fireball once more, Constantine.
I'd love to see you cook your own goose.

48:36.677 --> 48:38.500
Let me...

48:58.532 --> 49:00.633
I take it back. That thing is useful.

49:42.108 --> 49:44.398
Zatanna, where are you, darling?

49:44.478 --> 49:47.268
I know you can't speak,
but give me a wave.

49:47.348 --> 49:50.154
You're the only one here
that's really a threat.

49:57.125 --> 50:01.031
There you are. This will sting a bit.

50:23.517 --> 50:29.325
Stored magic? Really?
It's the TV dinner of spell casting, dear.

50:31.926 --> 50:34.831
Here's what real magic looks like.

51:10.364 --> 51:11.801
Z!

51:49.104 --> 51:51.675
Z, are you daft? Stop!

51:53.543 --> 51:55.764
I will kill you, woman!

52:26.976 --> 52:28.500
Z, don't!

52:31.680 --> 52:35.138
Don't kill him. You can't.

52:35.218 --> 52:36.722
Out of my way, John.

52:36.802 --> 52:40.573
If no blood is spilled,
your soul is in the clear.

52:49.666 --> 52:52.722
Get control, Z, just like I taught you.

52:52.802 --> 52:56.709
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy. Deep breaths.

52:57.540 --> 52:59.378
Let it go, love.

53:20.830 --> 53:23.488
Do you see why I can't do what you do?

53:23.968 --> 53:28.258
You lost control is all.
Happens to the best of us.

53:28.338 --> 53:30.642
You've seen me in action, right?

53:32.107 --> 53:35.114
Yeah, once or twice.

53:36.247 --> 53:42.420
Why are you here? I haven't done anything
to warrant this kind of response.

53:44.054 --> 53:46.042
This yours?

53:46.122 --> 53:47.664
I don't know. Maybe.

53:47.744 --> 53:51.415
I have several hundred rings
of varying design and properties.

53:51.845 --> 53:53.484
It isn't him.

53:53.564 --> 53:56.954
Felix Faust isn't the one
behind the nightmare crimes.

53:57.034 --> 54:00.991
He summoned our old poker buddies
in their more massive forms.

54:01.071 --> 54:02.592
The hell does it all mean?

54:02.672 --> 54:06.346
It means Felix Faust had access
to the artifact whenever he wanted.

54:06.626 --> 54:08.784
What artifact?

54:08.964 --> 54:10.920
Well, we're back to square one, then.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.107
Unfortunately, no. We were sent here
by your friend, remember?

54:15.187 --> 54:18.859
- But Ritchie's dying.
- Is he?

54:42.580 --> 54:46.920
Boy, boy. I think I got closer
to death than I planned.

54:49.517 --> 54:51.035
Bad girl.

54:51.115 --> 54:55.580
See, now, you were told to do everything
to help me by the master of the House,

54:55.660 --> 54:58.632
and that does not include punching.

55:00.331 --> 55:02.736
Bring me to the main room.

55:07.571 --> 55:10.276
I'll take it from here, beautiful.

55:12.344 --> 55:14.432
But I need you out of my hair for now,

55:14.512 --> 55:18.451
so why don't you just go
for a little walk?

55:47.780 --> 55:51.081
Yeah! That's the stuff.

56:00.091 --> 56:01.447
Why aren't we inside?

56:01.527 --> 56:05.151
Because Ritchie's bloody well
taken control of the House.

56:05.231 --> 56:09.637
This is what you get for having mates.
Boston, can you get inside?

56:15.240 --> 56:17.129
That would be a no.

56:18.009 --> 56:21.948
Ritchie, you're gonna listen to me
whether you like it or not.

56:24.148 --> 56:26.119
Open the door.

56:26.952 --> 56:29.056
Do you hear? Open it!

56:37.061 --> 56:39.265
Too late, Johnny Boy.

56:53.913 --> 56:55.335
Ritchie, please!

56:55.615 --> 56:58.254
Stop while there's still time
to save your soul.

56:58.334 --> 57:02.041
Says the man who skates
away from everything.

57:02.121 --> 57:03.576
Since you got me infected,

57:03.656 --> 57:08.581
I've looked all around the world
for a cure and I've finally found it.

57:08.761 --> 57:12.518
A small piece of the Dreamstone.
It's sentient.

57:12.598 --> 57:16.957
It told me how to get the Demons Three
to bring the rest of it to Earth.

57:17.637 --> 57:21.160
It would've been so easy
to take it from them.

57:21.240 --> 57:25.565
Of course, rock star Johnny
screwed everything sideways.

57:26.045 --> 57:30.903
So we had to frame Faust
and get you to bring me here.

57:30.983 --> 57:34.941
Now I'm immortal and supercharged!

57:35.021 --> 57:38.845
You've been played for a sap.
The Stone isn't sentient.

57:38.925 --> 57:42.516
What's left of Destiny's soul was
whispering sweet nothings in your ear,

57:42.596 --> 57:46.920
getting you to commit atrocities
to gain power and make his move.

57:47.000 --> 57:49.189
You're just pissed 'cause I won.

57:49.469 --> 57:51.640
I wish that were the case.

57:52.772 --> 57:54.775
This can't be right.

57:57.042 --> 57:58.678
No!

58:01.980 --> 58:04.653
Wait! Wait! We... we had a deal!

58:06.687 --> 58:08.690
We had a deal!

58:19.832 --> 58:22.636
Five hundred years, I've waited.

58:24.237 --> 58:26.609
Five hundred years, I've planned.

58:28.675 --> 58:31.965
Really? I guess 500 must be the new 300.

58:32.045 --> 58:34.736
What say we share
your beauty secrets over a pint?

58:34.816 --> 58:38.153
A god does not prattle with mortals.

58:57.438 --> 59:01.129
- She gonna be okay?
- I... I don't know.

59:01.709 --> 59:04.231
The amount of magic she's used,

59:04.311 --> 59:06.715
sometimes you don't recover.

59:11.718 --> 59:13.907
I should have never led her back.

59:13.987 --> 59:15.642
Selfish bastard, I am.

59:15.722 --> 59:19.325
You've done what you can for now,
but we have to stop Destiny,

59:19.405 --> 59:21.515
or everyone's at risk.

59:21.595 --> 59:26.519
He's right. He'll have this city by midnight,
the Eastern Seaboard by dawn.

59:26.599 --> 59:30.057
Then, what's to stop him? He'll be a god.

59:30.137 --> 59:32.845
We don't need another one
of those mucking about.

59:33.240 --> 59:35.110
All right.

01:00:14.483 --> 01:00:16.104
Get 'em!

01:00:16.384 --> 01:00:19.273
They're everywhere! Everywhere!

01:00:19.353 --> 01:00:21.176
Yes.

01:00:21.656 --> 01:00:23.545
Yes.

01:00:23.625 --> 01:00:25.426
<i>My will be done.</i>

01:00:30.899 --> 01:00:34.455
Fool! How can you hope to defeat a god?

01:00:34.535 --> 01:00:38.393
Not only can I sense you,
you cannot defeat my shield.

01:00:38.473 --> 01:00:41.512
Since when does God need a force shield?

01:00:52.888 --> 01:00:54.909
The Justice League are on their way.

01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:56.944
Suppose that couldn't be helped,

01:00:57.024 --> 01:01:00.982
but make sure they stay well away
from Destiny, to not be struck mad,

01:01:01.062 --> 01:01:04.934
unless you want a bunch of crazed
super blokes ripping apart the city.

01:01:08.168 --> 01:01:10.773
A little late for that, my friend.

01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:29.659
<i>John, listen to me.
You've been affected by magic.</i>

01:01:32.095 --> 01:01:34.565
<i>Get away to space now.</i>

01:01:47.376 --> 01:01:49.298
Sorry to have to ask this, Jason.

01:01:49.378 --> 01:01:51.885
At least you're asking.

01:01:51.965 --> 01:01:54.787
Gone, gone, the form of man.

01:01:54.867 --> 01:01:58.391
Rise the demon Etrigan!

01:01:59.021 --> 01:02:02.511
So Constantine calls once more.

01:02:02.591 --> 01:02:05.048
Just like a greedy, wanton...

01:02:05.128 --> 01:02:07.117
Save the bloody rhymes, and top that git!

01:02:07.197 --> 01:02:09.267
Killjoy.

01:02:14.036 --> 01:02:17.361
I've had many years
to think about you, Etrigan.

01:02:28.383 --> 01:02:31.084
Call this poetic justice.

01:02:45.668 --> 01:02:47.672
Holy crap.

01:02:52.942 --> 01:02:55.698
Looks like you've finally
beat the curse, my boy.

01:02:55.778 --> 01:02:58.116
Wish it were under happier circumstances.

01:02:59.949 --> 01:03:02.439
- What are you doing?
- Calling for help.

01:03:02.519 --> 01:03:05.989
I just hope he doesn't realize
it's me doing the calling.

01:03:21.571 --> 01:03:23.961
Who dares strike at me?

01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:28.432
The Defender of the Green...

01:03:28.512 --> 01:03:31.504
Swamp Thing.

01:03:50.967 --> 01:03:52.637
Perfect.

01:04:03.846 --> 01:04:06.564
Glad to see you
back on your feet, Zatanna.

01:04:13.858 --> 01:04:16.562
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

01:05:04.508 --> 01:05:09.182
The so-called Guardian of the Green
who secretly hopes to be human again.

01:05:09.914 --> 01:05:12.684
Let me dispel you of that notion.

01:05:29.065 --> 01:05:31.270
Back to the dirt...

01:05:32.302 --> 01:05:34.508
where you belong.

01:05:45.883 --> 01:05:49.107
He's getting more powerful by the second.
What the hell are we gonna do?

01:05:49.187 --> 01:05:51.543
I say we go and talk
to a man about a horse.

01:05:51.623 --> 01:05:53.663
Did you hit your head or something?
You're babbling.

01:05:53.743 --> 01:05:56.581
A Trojan horse, Boston. Come on!

01:05:59.363 --> 01:06:01.835
Over here, you wanker!

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:07.658
You are puny and disrespectful.

01:06:07.738 --> 01:06:10.376
Let me see your madness.

01:06:16.999 --> 01:06:19.821
Well, that's the trouble with someone
like me. Been there, done that.

01:06:19.901 --> 01:06:23.275
I shall make you beg for death.

01:06:23.355 --> 01:06:25.943
Can I beg you to stop talking?

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:29.081
I mean, all wizards are touched,
but you, you're a full-blown nutter.

01:06:29.161 --> 01:06:33.051
I will tear your soul apart.

01:06:33.131 --> 01:06:35.687
And what happened
to not prattling with mortals?

01:06:35.767 --> 01:06:38.839
You chatter like my grandma
at a book club.

01:06:39.772 --> 01:06:41.692
Now, Boston!

01:06:41.772 --> 01:06:44.047
Trick or treat, freak!

01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:06.467
Is that a sword in your chest,
or are you just glad to see me?

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.589
Merlin sends his regards.

01:07:10.617 --> 01:07:13.408
And by the way, you lose.

01:07:34.427 --> 01:07:36.664
I don't think so.

01:07:54.915 --> 01:07:58.269
Johnny, I was... I was under a compulsion.

01:07:58.349 --> 01:08:02.943
You've got to save me.
You owe me. You owe me!

01:08:03.123 --> 01:08:07.896
Sorry, mate. Can't take the chance
that Destiny is still pulling your strings.

01:08:09.261 --> 01:08:12.269
John, please! Help me!

01:08:19.171 --> 01:08:22.228
Help me, you bastard!

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:24.947
Help me!

01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:28.734
That was unpleasant.

01:08:29.215 --> 01:08:31.238
What the hell did I miss?

01:08:31.318 --> 01:08:34.191
Z, you're okay. I thought...

01:08:34.270 --> 01:08:37.475
My head feels like
the morning after Brixton.

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:40.895
Surely not that bad.

01:08:41.761 --> 01:08:45.653
So Merlin's spell hath ended.

01:08:45.733 --> 01:08:47.688
It would seem so.

01:08:47.768 --> 01:08:51.640
Though it's a "good news,
bad news" sort of thing.

01:09:02.716 --> 01:09:05.738
- What's going on?
- Yeah. He wasn't wounded.

01:09:05.818 --> 01:09:10.325
Unless I miss my guess, that happened
on the day he was bound to Etrigan.

01:09:11.957 --> 01:09:14.214
And now that I'm not...

01:09:14.294 --> 01:09:16.884
I'm truly sorry, Jason.

01:09:16.964 --> 01:09:21.002
Don't be. It's a welcome end.

01:09:32.513 --> 01:09:36.904
For 500 years, he and I have been bound.

01:09:36.984 --> 01:09:41.340
A demon from hell, a knight of renown.

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:45.178
Though we were cursed
to be slaves to each other,

01:09:45.258 --> 01:09:49.450
I know of no man
I'd want more for a brother.

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:51.808
Farewell, mortal.

01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.371
You couldn't have picked a better place.

01:10:09.651 --> 01:10:12.206
The village where he was born
was over there.

01:10:12.286 --> 01:10:14.657
Too bad it took this to get him home.

01:10:16.124 --> 01:10:19.329
Batman asked me to be
in the Justice League.

01:10:19.711 --> 01:10:20.865
And you're considering it?

01:10:20.945 --> 01:10:23.952
I visited their headquarters
a few days ago.

01:10:24.032 --> 01:10:26.720
It's interesting, and like you said,

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.257
maybe it's time to make a difference.

01:10:29.737 --> 01:10:31.595
Listening to me now?

01:10:31.905 --> 01:10:34.076
They want you, too.

01:10:35.711 --> 01:10:39.015
Good one, Z. Too right, they do.

01:10:41.615 --> 01:10:43.748
You have got to be bloody kidding.

01:10:43.828 --> 01:10:46.542
No way. Batty would go mental.

01:10:46.622 --> 01:10:48.727
He was the one who asked,

01:10:48.807 --> 01:10:51.711
and I told him that's what you'd say.

01:10:54.094 --> 01:10:55.931
Be safe, John.

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:11.332
Now, hold on. Hold on.

01:11:11.412 --> 01:11:13.367
Maybe I've been a bit rash.

01:11:13.447 --> 01:11:15.852
Could you tell me more over a drink?

01:11:16.885 --> 01:11:19.674
We could rechristen the House, as it were.

01:11:20.121 --> 01:11:23.657
- A drink?
- Yeah, a drink.

01:11:27.162 --> 01:11:31.219
Don't think this is gonna turn into
some sort of Manchester weekend.

01:11:31.299 --> 01:11:33.689
Get that out of your head.

01:11:33.969 --> 01:11:36.659
We could have a Trewhiddle Tuesday.

01:11:37.539 --> 01:11:41.545
- No, definitely not.
- Well, let's mark that as a maybe.

01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:03.367
Now, that's what I call
making yourself useful, love.
