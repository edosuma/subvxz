00:17.559 --> 00:20.471
Mom. Mom.

00:20.896 --> 00:24.935
Mom, I want you to be the ﬁrst to read it:
“Long live the Loch Ness Monster."

00:25.109 --> 00:26.974
Mr. Hedges said
it's my best story yet...

00:27.152 --> 00:30.440
...even better than the one
about the alien abductions.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.649
Something tells me
those aren't happy tears.

00:38.122 --> 00:39.578
What's wrong?

00:41.792 --> 00:44.408
I'm so proud of you.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.580
My little cub reporter.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.087
Oh, I'm so-- I'm so sorry.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.926
Wait, for what? You didn't do anything.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.341
It's time, Mrs. Sullivan.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.805
Mom, who are those people?
Where are you going?

01:06.859 --> 01:10.647
Mommy is just going on a little vacation.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.698
By yourself?

01:13.866 --> 01:15.822
Don't you worry...

01:16.243 --> 01:18.655
...your daddy's
gonna take good care of you.

01:18.829 --> 01:21.866
But nobody goes on a vacation
by themselves.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.456
When are you coming back?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.819
I hope you're calling
with good news, doctor.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.534
Well, I wish I have better news,
Mr. Luthor...

02:04.708 --> 02:07.700
...but I'm afraid the patient still denies
having any powers.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.915
She wouldn't be the ﬁrst freak
who refused to show her true colors.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.920
-Keep pressing.
-Oh, I'm sorry, sir....

02:14.927 --> 02:17.589
-There's nothing else-
-I want answers.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.791
What do you want?

03:04.309 --> 03:05.845
Thanks, Lex.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.434
Chloe.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.946
Hey, we were supposed to meet
for coffee this morning.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.866
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I guess I must have slept in.

04:50.374 --> 04:53.707
After a run in the mud?
Did you forget to wipe your feet?

04:53.877 --> 04:57.836
All I remember is I was doing my dishes
here at the apartment...

04:58.215 --> 05:00.547
...and then I'm waking up in bed.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.626
Maybe you were sleepwalking.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.713
Last night, possibly, but this isn't
the ﬁrst time this has happened.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.008
Two days ago, I was typing
on my computer at the Daily Planet...

05:11.186 --> 05:13.802
...and then "boom," I'm waking up
at home the next morning.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.560
Do you think something is starting
to happen to me...

05:17.734 --> 05:19.520
...like in a krypto freak kind of way?

05:19.695 --> 05:23.483
Hey, don't reporters usually deal in facts,
not jumping to conclusions?

05:23.657 --> 05:26.615
Yeah, I know.
It's just that ever since I found out...

05:26.785 --> 05:29.447
...that I'm a member
of the meteor-infected masses...

05:29.621 --> 05:33.205
...l've been seriously
and secretly freaking out.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.915
I don't blame you.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.705
But you don't have
to go through this alone, all right?

05:43.093 --> 05:45.084
Come on, I'll give you a ride to work.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.636
Okay.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.192
Lex, what happened?

06:11.038 --> 06:14.155
I was in a little fender-bender last night.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.994
Why didn't you wake me?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.958
Lana, you've been dealing
with so much lately.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.963
I wanted to let you sleep.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.965
But it seems like you're not sleeping
much anyway.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.515
I haven't told anyone yet.

06:35.520 --> 06:41.311
Somehow, saying I lost the baby out loud
makes it more real.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.526
I know.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.521
I'm hurting as much as you are.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.201
On the last sonogram,
the baby was perfectly healthy.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.409
Lana, I promise...

06:56.583 --> 06:59.620
...give it time and we'll have a house full
of beautiful children.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.706
What if there's something wrong
with me?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.666
What if that's why I lost the baby?

07:04.174 --> 07:06.586
You can't do that to yourself.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.215
Dr. Albright told us...

07:08.386 --> 07:12.004
...a third of all pregnancies
miscarry with no rhyme or reason.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.047
I want a complete checkup.

07:14.226 --> 07:17.389
I want every test possible
to ﬁnd out what went wrong.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.519
Absolutely.

07:20.899 --> 07:23.265
I'll make an appointment immediately.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.105
Now, get some rest.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.658
When you blacked out at the Planet, do
you remember what you were working on?

07:36.832 --> 07:39.073
Just a story about tree planting
in Circle Park.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.458
I mean, nothing controversial.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.495
Is that Lex's car out there?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.879
Let's go see what's going on.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.511
No offense,
but I think Lex can get his own AAA.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.843
Something doesn't seem right.
Let's turn around.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.475
Come on.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.796
The police got here
before Lex's cleanup crew could mop up.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.675
That LuthorCorp security guy grabbed
his cell phone.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.805
It's time to perk up those ears.

08:40.103 --> 08:41.684
Jax, what have you got?

08:41.855 --> 08:45.518
I searched the car and surrounding areas.
The ﬂash drive is gone, Mr. Luthor.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.399
Whoever ran you off the road
must have taken it.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.727
Okay. Bye.

08:51.323 --> 08:52.529
What is it?

08:53.241 --> 08:55.618
Lex didn't crash by himself.
He had a little help.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.525
Whoever it is, stole his ﬂash drive.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.490
Do we know who Racer X is?

08:59.664 --> 09:03.122
No, but their vision is only 20/20.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.547
-What's that?
-What's what? You see Lex's ﬂash drive?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.553
Did you just--?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.348
I found something. It's a button.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.230
That's my button.

09:29.402 --> 09:33.520
-Either this is some bizarre coincidence or--
-I was here last night.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.953
Do the math, Clark.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.362
The muddy boots, the missing button.
It's me. I'm the road warrior.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.998
Before you throw the book at yourself,
there's probably another explanation.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.668
Can you explain this?

09:53.510 --> 09:56.252
Let's face it, I'm guilty as charged.

09:57.430 --> 10:01.014
Chloe, whatever you did,
you clearly weren't yourself.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.565
There's only one document on here.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.987
And it's a krypto freak's case ﬁle.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.360
Is there a name?

10:17.701 --> 10:19.612
ltjust lists an ID number.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.451
With a serious ability.

10:21.621 --> 10:26.081
They're suspected of being able
to control meteor freaks.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.167
Clark, whoever this is,
I think they controlled me.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.328
Chloe, of all the people in the world...

10:31.506 --> 10:33.997
...why would they choose you
to run Lex off the road?

10:35.051 --> 10:37.428
"Date of birth: September 20, 1960."

10:37.595 --> 10:38.880
"Born In: Granville, Kansas."

10:46.062 --> 10:48.178
Oh, my God, Clark.

10:50.025 --> 10:51.856
That's my mom.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.044
I wanna see my daughter.

11:17.218 --> 11:21.678
You'll get to see Chloe.
We just need to take things slowly.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.430
The drug you've been given
is in its experimental stage.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.513
Wouldn't want your ability to throw you
back into a catatonic state.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.896
Whatever ability you think I have
is a ﬁgment of your imagination.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.979
Your medical ﬁle,
you claimed you committed yourself...

11:35.153 --> 11:38.190
...because you had the power
to control your daughter.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.482
When you touch one of her possessions,
you could make her do whatever you wanted.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.617
l was sick, mentally ill.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.825
Whatever I said was the product
of a delusional mind.

11:47.999 --> 11:51.116
Delusions don't short-circuit your brain.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.910
You can thank your incredible power
for that.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.250
And maybe it's wishful thinking...

11:56.424 --> 12:01.134
...but I'm willing to bet you can use
that power to control others just like her.

12:01.304 --> 12:05.798
Whatever connection I have to Chloe
is because I'm her mother.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.226
We have a bond.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.885
You certainly do.

12:12.524 --> 12:16.733
You both happen to have traces
of meteor rock in your bloodstream.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.325
l have to see Chloe.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.824
Of course.

12:28.998 --> 12:32.240
I'm not one to stand in the way
of a mother-daughter reunion.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.167
| just need you to demonstrate
your powers for me.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.418
There's nothing to demonstrate.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.717
I've never been able to control anyone
but Chloe.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.976
Well, I suppose there's a ﬁrst time
for everything.

13:05.910 --> 13:09.027
Chloe, wasn't your mom catatonic
the last time you saw her?

13:09.205 --> 13:11.491
Look, I don't often play
late-night bumper cars.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.998
She was controlling me.
The question is: Why?

13:14.169 --> 13:18.287
-We don't know anything for sure, yet.
-My mom can manipulate krypto freaks.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.457
Whether we wanna admit it or not,
I'm part of that demographic.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.468
Hi, I'm Chloe Sullivan.
I'm here to see my mother, Moira Sullivan.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.924
Did you not understand this
the ﬁrst time?

13:28.099 --> 13:30.215
You were asked never to come back here.

13:31.895 --> 13:35.513
I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
She hasn't been here for months.

13:36.191 --> 13:41.231
Your friend created a huge scene yesterday
and we don't want a repeat performance.

13:42.322 --> 13:46.315
Well, there's no matinee scheduled.
| just wanna see my mom.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.905
Security is on its way. I suggest you leave
before they have to escort you out.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.334
My mother is here.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.962
You can't prevent her
from seeing her own morn.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.055
-Chloe, come here.
-Clark, what are you doing?

14:11.226 --> 14:14.969
-l'm not gonna let them tell me--
-Just wait for me outside. Trust me.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.839
Time for a little show-and-tell,
Mrs. Sullivan.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.419
What do you want from me?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.473
Give her all you got, Lowell.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.456
Stop.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.176
Sit down.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.686
I already told him,
l'rn here to pick up my mother.

15:47.864 --> 15:51.857
Apparently, per her doctor’s orders,
Moira Sullivan 's been transferred.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.991
lMthout notifying me?

15:54.162 --> 15:57.120
-You'll have to ask her psychiatrist.
-Fine. Where is he?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.406
l'rn afraid he '8 out of town
at a conference.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.166
-You're lying.
-You can 't go in there.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.202
-Security.
-You can 't stop me!

16:04.380 --> 16:06.211
I can't believe I did that.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.294
Your mom must have sent you
to the sanitarium for help.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.585
She didn't know
she'd been transferred.

16:12.764 --> 16:17.428
So she had me steal Lex's ﬂash drive
so I could ﬁnd out where she really was.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.976
Either way,
she's sending out an SOS.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.478
We got it loud and clear.
Let's go talk to Lex.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.861
I swear to you, I never knew
I could control anyone else.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.364
Come on.

16:42.085 --> 16:45.543
You're more talented
than you give yourself credit for.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.255
And now it's time
to put those talents to good use.

16:52.595 --> 16:55.928
This man is a violent psychopath.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.183
Good for him.
What does that have to do with me?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.561
He escaped from this facility last night.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.437
I need you to send him back here.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.599
I am not going to be used.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.526
Really?

17:11.823 --> 17:17.159
See, I had this notion that seeing
your daughter was a high priority.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.827
But considering you were able
to abandon her...

17:19.997 --> 17:22.033
...when she needed you the most...

17:22.291 --> 17:23.952
...maybe not.

17:32.135 --> 17:35.298
I know what it's like
to lose my mother, Mrs. Sullivan.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.298
You don't get over it.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.563
Bring this man back to me...

17:45.273 --> 17:48.060
...and I make sure
you see your daughter.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.991
This belongs to him.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.344
Find Lex Luthor.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.677
And kill him.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.032
-Where's Lex Luthor?
-Who are you?

18:40.411 --> 18:41.821
Tell me where he is.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.795
You shouldn't have done that.

19:04.185 --> 19:08.519
Clark, she needs a doctor. You gotta get her
to the hospital right away.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.395
What about him?

19:11.818 --> 19:14.651
I can handle him.
Clark, she's pregnant.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.733
Go. Now.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.455
What the hell are you doing?

19:36.634 --> 19:40.673
Believe me, I can pull this trigger
a lot faster than you can ﬂinch.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.431
The last thing I remember,
l was running on the train tracks.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.852
And when you woke up,
your memory was gone.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.519
You know my mother, Moira Sullivan.
Where is she?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.479
I don't know who you're talking about.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.485
l was kept in this facility with a bunch
of other people with powers.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.907
Where's the facility?

20:13.379 --> 20:15.870
The good news is
there's no sign of a concussion.

20:16.048 --> 20:20.132
Because of your recent miscarriage,
I'd like to run a few tests just to be safe.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.168
-Thank you.
-Okay.

20:27.768 --> 20:28.757
Lana?

20:30.855 --> 20:33.267
I heard what happened. Are you okay?

20:33.441 --> 20:36.103
I guess that depends
on your deﬁnition.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.939
Is the baby all right?

20:50.666 --> 20:53.749
I lost it a few days after the wedding.

21:00.468 --> 21:03.175
You're the ﬁrst person I've told.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.638
I'm so sorry.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.512
I feel like I've lost so much.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.691
I thought having this baby
would change things...

21:20.404 --> 21:22.486
...but now that it's gone....

21:25.910 --> 21:28.401
This isn't the life that I wanted.

21:32.208 --> 21:36.201
Does this have anything to do with what
happened the day of your wedding?

21:41.676 --> 21:45.544
You told me you weren't gonna marry Lex,
and then all of a sudden, somehow...

21:46.847 --> 21:49.133
...something changed your mind.
What was it?

21:52.061 --> 21:54.143
It was just wedding day jitters, that's all.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.770
Lana".

21:58.734 --> 22:00.690
...it was more than that.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.145
I can help you.

22:05.908 --> 22:07.364
You don't need to be afraid--

22:07.535 --> 22:10.572
Clark, I need you
to stop worrying about me.

22:12.289 --> 22:14.371
It's okay. Really.

22:16.836 --> 22:20.749
I'm going to get through this,
like I always do.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.391
When my wife ends up in the hospital,
that means you've made a mistake.

22:37.565 --> 22:40.056
Well, I didn't mean for anyone else
to get hurt.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.520
I just wanted you to suffer.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.773
Oh, clearly Chloe gets her brazenness
from her mother's side.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.531
But as meddlesome as she can be,
I've actually come to admire her.

22:54.373 --> 22:58.491
-That's what makes this so difﬁcult.
-You stay away from my daughter.

22:58.669 --> 23:01.285
Oh, it's too late for that.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.550
Clark?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.590
Clark?

23:16.187 --> 23:17.768
Clark?

23:17.938 --> 23:19.644
Hey, how's Lana?

23:19.815 --> 23:22.397
She's okay. What did you ﬁnd out?

23:22.902 --> 23:25.814
My mom was playing Simon says
with that guy at the mansion...

23:25.988 --> 23:27.524
...which means she's desperate.

23:27.698 --> 23:30.189
-He told me where I could ﬁnd her.
-Can we trust him?

23:30.367 --> 23:33.825
There is an old abandoned hospital
on Paper Mill Road, just like he said.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.861
-And it's owned by—
-LuthorCorp.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.578
-lt's probably another 33.1 franchise.
-l was gonna go check it out.

23:39.752 --> 23:43.540
But I thought it would be more wise
for me to come get my army of one.

23:48.344 --> 23:54.590
Chloe, get out of Smallville, sweetheart,
as fast as you can.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.976
-Hey, where are you going?
-I have to leave.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.807
-Chloe.
-Let me go, Clark.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.724
-l have to leave town.
-l'm not letting you go anywhere.

24:08.197 --> 24:11.280
-What's going on?
-lt's your mom. She's trying to control you.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.735
Oh, my God.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.650
Are you okay?

24:14.829 --> 24:16.785
Yeah, I'm just dizzy.

24:17.581 --> 24:21.165
-Can you get me a glass of water?
-Yeah.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.555
I'm sorry, Clark, but I have no choice.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.762
Please. Don't do this.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.267
It's the only way I'll be able
to get out of Smallville.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.682
-I need to get through.
-Sorry, miss.

25:23.856 --> 25:26.814
You don't understand.
I need to leave town right now.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.642
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to re-route you.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.526
What are you—?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.370
Mom?

25:56.096 --> 25:57.802
Mom.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.929
Chloe.

26:09.777 --> 26:12.610
You're even more beautiful
than I remember.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.817
I can't believe you're awake
and you're talking.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.152
I thought I'd never get
to speak to you again.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.319
Honey, you shouldn't be here.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.283
This is all my fault.

26:23.457 --> 26:26.949
No, it's not. You needed my help.

26:28.504 --> 26:32.497
You're suffering
because of what I made you do.

26:32.675 --> 26:35.462
-Just like when you were little.
-What?

26:38.055 --> 26:42.173
Remember when you were 8
and you hurt your hands?

26:42.351 --> 26:46.515
Yeah, how could I forget?
I had to wear those bandages for weeks.

26:46.689 --> 26:49.146
You know, I've never played
kickball since then.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.523
You didn't hurt your hand
playing kickball.

26:56.991 --> 26:59.482
You came home from school.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.244
And your hands were all covered in ink.

27:03.414 --> 27:06.156
So I told you to go wash your hands.

27:06.333 --> 27:11.248
Instead, you went
to play with your computer.

27:11.755 --> 27:14.588
I was so frustrated.

27:15.884 --> 27:19.797
I sent you to go wash your hands...

27:19.972 --> 27:23.885
...and scrub them
till all the ink was gone.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.513
Mom, what are you saying?

27:28.105 --> 27:29.436
I found you...

27:30.357 --> 27:32.348
...in the bathroom.

27:32.651 --> 27:37.065
There was blood everywhere.
You had scrubbed your hands raw.

27:37.906 --> 27:41.490
That's why I left,
to protect you from me.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.660
And now I have to protect you
from Lex Luthor.

27:50.753 --> 27:54.541
This man that brought you here,
he knows you're infected.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.330
You have to get out of here.

27:56.717 --> 27:59.049
No, we have to get out of here.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.346
Mom, you can control people
with powers.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.630
Is there anyone in here
whose ability could free us?

28:09.897 --> 28:11.728
I'd love to.

28:11.899 --> 28:14.265
Yes, lunch before the meeting is perfect.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.434
Okay, bye-bye.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.481
Clark.

28:25.079 --> 28:28.867
Sweetie, wake up. Clark.

28:30.334 --> 28:33.076
-Mom?
-Oh, baby.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.794
-No more experiments.
-Keep walking.

28:43.138 --> 28:47.222
Help! I need help in here! Please. Help.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.351
My mom, she's sick. She needs a doctor.

28:51.522 --> 28:54.730
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. But you have to help her.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.061
-Hey, hey!
-What the hell?

28:57.236 --> 28:58.897
Mom! Mom!

29:02.699 --> 29:06.487
Protect me and my daughter.
Set us free.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.882
Hold it right there.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.522
-Come here!
-Chloe.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.397
-Mom.
-Go! Get out of here!

29:38.735 --> 29:40.316
Take her back to her cell.

29:42.698 --> 29:46.566
Chloe, whatever you have to do,
get out now.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.838
Lex, get out of my way.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.838
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.728
Don't let your mother make you do
something you'll later—

30:51.892 --> 30:53.553
Hey, I brought sandwiches.

30:53.727 --> 30:56.810
I realized I don't know which ones you like.
I bought one of each.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.268
-I don't think your mom's hungry.
-How come? Have you talked to Oliver?

31:00.442 --> 31:02.979
He said he'd set up a safe place
for her to stay in Star City.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.438
Chloe, we have a problem.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.508
Mom?

31:32.474 --> 31:33.509
Mom?

31:34.935 --> 31:39.099
Hi. I wanted to see a blue sky...

31:39.648 --> 31:41.639
...one last time.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.938
There'll be plenty of blue skies
where you're going.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.649
You're not gonna be locked
inside anymore.

31:48.365 --> 31:50.151
Sweetheart...

31:51.952 --> 31:53.658
...l'm slipping back.

31:54.830 --> 31:58.493
The drug that Lex used on your mom
only lasts 24 hours...

31:58.667 --> 32:00.908
...or else she won't stay lucid.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.410
Chloe, she doesn't have much time left.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.247
-Well, I'll go talk to Lex. I'll make--
-No.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.920
No deal with that man. I can't allow it.

32:12.097 --> 32:14.179
I've lost you once,
I'll not do it again.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.762
If this drug is out there, I can get it.
Trust me.

32:17.936 --> 32:21.099
I have some pretty amazing resources
at my disposal.

32:26.111 --> 32:29.774
Being with you again...

32:32.993 --> 32:37.362
...it's the greatest gift
I could have ever been given.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.619
But I'm dangerous, Chloe.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.499
No, Mom, that's not true.

32:44.713 --> 32:50.049
My ability to control people
with powers...

32:52.012 --> 32:57.223
...it's like I'm a human weapon,
and I can't— I can't allow it.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.429
But, Mom, it doesn't have to be like this.

33:04.024 --> 33:08.017
My little cub reporter.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.237
This....

33:13.116 --> 33:14.322
This belongs...

33:16.745 --> 33:18.576
...to you.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.329
No, Mom, please.

33:22.709 --> 33:27.294
Please don't go, Mom.
Not yet. Not again.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.017
...love you...

33:46.316 --> 33:48.853
...Chlo-- Chloe.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.569
I love you too, Mom.

34:33.363 --> 34:36.605
"LuthorCorp Crimes Against Humanity."

34:37.993 --> 34:39.529
It's catchy.

34:42.497 --> 34:44.658
Too bad it'll never make it to print.

34:46.752 --> 34:51.837
Lex, I'm tired of playing hardball,
or softball or any ball for that matter.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.838
Game's over.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.344
I tell you,
your audacity is impressive, Chloe.

34:59.514 --> 35:02.847
Especially, given your recent
late-night activities.

35:05.562 --> 35:09.054
What, you don't remember?

35:09.691 --> 35:12.683
You ran my car off the road
a few nights ago.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.443
My investigators have boot prints,
hair ﬁbers...

35:15.614 --> 35:18.856
-...samples of mud found in your apartment.
-You were in my apartment?

35:19.034 --> 35:21.650
How many years do you get
for aggravated assault? Ten? Twenty?

35:21.828 --> 35:23.864
For what you've done,
they'll throw away the key.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.529
What I've done?

35:26.708 --> 35:30.701
You don't have a shred of proof
about any of this, and you never will.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.790
But rest assured...

35:32.964 --> 35:37.298
...the evidence I have against you
is locked away, safe and secure.

35:39.513 --> 35:44.553
Make that article disappear
and you'll remain a free woman.

35:45.519 --> 35:47.134
Deal?

35:49.648 --> 35:54.733
My mother sacriﬁced everything
to protect the world from scum like you.

35:54.903 --> 35:59.772
And if taking you down means spending
some quality time behind bars, sign me up.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.283
Well, I thought you might say that.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.153
That's why there's a plan B
ﬁrmly in place.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.917
A plan that makes prison
look like a picnic.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.649
Well, now, Mrs. Luthor....

36:39.698 --> 36:41.609
I did an extensive battery of tests...

36:41.783 --> 36:44.866
...and actually,
I found something quite troubling.

36:45.954 --> 36:47.490
What is it? What's wrong?

36:47.664 --> 36:50.406
Did you give yourself injections,
or did you take pills?

36:52.502 --> 36:55.335
I took prenatal vitamins. That's it.

36:56.298 --> 37:00.382
Vitamins don't cause fatigue, nausea,
and a suspension of your menstrual cycle.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.797
Synthetic hormones do.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.553
Synthetic hormones? What do you mean?

37:05.724 --> 37:08.136
That's what we found
in your bloodstream.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.312
That's what you took
to fake a pregnancy...

37:14.482 --> 37:17.315
...and to force a marriage to a billionaire.

37:20.363 --> 37:24.151
When you stopped taking them, it appeared
as if you'd simply miscarried, didn't it?

37:33.793 --> 37:36.045
I don't understand.

37:37.505 --> 37:41.464
I saw the sonograms. I saw my baby.

37:46.681 --> 37:50.048
I don't know whose baby you saw,
but I can assure you, it wasn't yours.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.316
I was never pregnant.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.866
You okay?

38:11.206 --> 38:12.821
How you doing?

38:17.045 --> 38:20.378
It's just so unfair.

38:20.548 --> 38:24.040
I mean, she's never gonna be able to read
any of the articles I've written.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.380
You know, or meet Jimmy.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.557
She's never gonna get to know
the person that I've become.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.106
It's a good thing I told her.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.648
You did?

38:47.242 --> 38:49.654
After I brought your mom
to Oliver's apartment...

38:49.828 --> 38:52.740
...I gave her the complete
Chloe Sullivan bio.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.162
She was so proud.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.375
That's something
no one can ever take away.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.172
Lex came to talk to me, Clark.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.221
Basically, he said it's either kill
or be killed.

39:17.814 --> 39:19.475
The story or me.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.390
-He threatened you?
-l'm in his cross hairs.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.651
-Well, now he's in mine.
-Think about Lana.

39:25.864 --> 39:29.527
We can't do anything to him
until we know she's safe.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.325
You're right.

39:32.871 --> 39:35.453
He'd feed her to the lions
just to spite me.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.117
But it's inevitable.

39:42.630 --> 39:44.712
The war's about to begin.

39:56.311 --> 40:01.180
If Christopher Reeve was a real-life Superman,
then Dana Reeve would be his Lois Lane.

40:01.357 --> 40:04.440
Dana symbolized hope
to the millions living with paralysis...

40:04.611 --> 40:07.774
...through her tireless work on behalf
of the caregiver community.

40:07.947 --> 40:11.656
The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation
remains committed to Dana's work...

40:11.826 --> 40:13.487
...but needs your help.

40:13.661 --> 40:17.950
Be a superhero to those with paralysis
by visiting ChristopherReeve.org...

40:18.124 --> 40:21.867
...and purchasing a pair of Superman tags
engraved with the Superman logo...

40:22.045 --> 40:24.912
...and the foundation slogan:
"Go fonNard."

40:25.090 --> 40:28.002
All proceeds go towards funding
innovative research...

40:28.176 --> 40:32.260
...and improving the quality of life
for those living with paralysis.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.533
