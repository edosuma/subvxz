WEBVTT

00:12.708 --> 00:14.708
[ticking]

00:27.791 --> 00:29.458
[siren wailing]

00:29.458 --> 00:33.833
- Do you recognize this form?
- Yes, it's a CFC, a Consent for Care Form.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.625
- Hey, Freddie, no siren, okay? Thanks.
- [wailing stops]

00:36.625 --> 00:38.875
- What purpose does this form serve?
- Um...

00:38.875 --> 00:39.791
[siren wailing]

00:39.791 --> 00:42.625
It's an agreement between the patients,
the providers, the...

00:42.625 --> 00:44.500
Freddie. Siren.

00:45.041 --> 00:47.958
- The patients, the providers, the company.
- [wailing stops]

00:47.958 --> 00:52.083
It lists all the risks and side-effects
associated with the proposed treatment.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.041
Have you ever signed as a witness
on a CFC?

00:54.041 --> 00:55.791
- Yes, I have.
- And is this your signature?

00:55.791 --> 00:57.916
- No, it's not.
- [papers rustle]

00:57.916 --> 00:58.958
How about this one?

00:58.958 --> 01:00.291
[siren wailing]

01:00.291 --> 01:01.500
No.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.458
And so on more forms.

01:03.458 --> 01:06.333
Why might someone forge your signature
on a CFC form?

01:06.333 --> 01:07.708
Objection. Speculation.

01:07.708 --> 01:08.791
[chuckles]

01:09.541 --> 01:11.708
Mr. Usher, in your opinion,

01:11.708 --> 01:15.000
what's a likely reason
to forge a signature on a CFC form?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.166
To make it look like the patient
knew the risks

01:18.166 --> 01:21.416
and made an informed decision
to join the trial.

01:21.416 --> 01:22.416
[siren wailing]

01:22.416 --> 01:26.416
And also to shield the company
from liability.

01:26.416 --> 01:27.583
Jesus, Fred.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.541
[sighs] Take a time out, yeah?

01:31.541 --> 01:33.583
- Can I get you some more tea?
- I'm fine.

01:33.583 --> 01:36.833
Hey, sweetie. I just put Tammy down.
What is the problem?

01:36.833 --> 01:39.208
[Roderick] We're rehearsing,
and he's making noise.

01:39.208 --> 01:40.458
Can you take care of him?

01:41.166 --> 01:44.333
Kids make noise, Roderick.
That's how we know they're working.

01:45.708 --> 01:47.916
Sweetie, why don't you play
in Mommy's room?

01:47.916 --> 01:49.000
[siren wailing]

01:51.791 --> 01:52.750
[sighs]

01:52.750 --> 01:54.833
So sorry about your rehearsal.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.666
That's really no problem.

02:00.041 --> 02:03.041
I support what you're doing, I really do,

02:03.041 --> 02:05.458
but what about after?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.500
I mean,
with everything that he has turned over,

02:08.500 --> 02:11.041
is it really necessary
going on the record?

02:12.250 --> 02:15.833
Well, the documents aren't forged
unless he points and says,

02:15.833 --> 02:17.958
- "I didn't sign that."
- [Annabel] Mmm.

02:17.958 --> 02:19.875
So, without him, my case is...

02:21.541 --> 02:24.625
[sputters] You can't blow the whistle
without a whistleblower.

02:24.625 --> 02:27.583
I wish it were otherwise. I truly do.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.500
He'll be fired.

02:31.416 --> 02:32.291
Yes.

02:33.791 --> 02:38.291
I'd like your word that when it's done,
we can count on your help.

02:38.291 --> 02:41.291
- Of course, I mean, in so much as--
- I would like your word.

02:43.666 --> 02:44.625
You have my word.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.666
[Roderick sighs]

02:50.583 --> 02:51.625
[Auguste sighs]

02:53.708 --> 02:54.791
[kisses]

02:54.791 --> 02:56.833
[Annabel] You boys give them hell.

02:56.833 --> 02:57.750
[Roderick] Okay.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.708
Here's that tea.

03:05.041 --> 03:06.000
You're a lucky man.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.625
[exhales] Yeah.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.875
What about you? You got some luck at home?

03:16.833 --> 03:19.708
I think so.
I'm never there, so who can say?

03:19.708 --> 03:23.291
Yeah, she puts up with a lot.

03:26.916 --> 03:27.833
So does he.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.000
Both of us lucky in one way, at least.

03:37.666 --> 03:40.416
Got good people at home
who love us anyway.

03:42.416 --> 03:43.625
Let's not let them down.

03:45.375 --> 03:46.833
Let's make this one worth it.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.375
Do you recognize this form?

03:52.375 --> 03:54.666
Yes, that is a Consent For Care form.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.500
[Auguste] <i>Annabel Lee.</i>

03:56.500 --> 03:58.833
You know,
I've thought about it over the years

03:58.833 --> 04:02.250
because I've got a good sense for people.

04:03.125 --> 04:05.708
I ask myself what went wrong.

04:06.291 --> 04:10.291
What malfunctioned with me back then
to make me trust you?

04:10.833 --> 04:13.708
And I figured it out. It was her.

04:14.541 --> 04:16.583
I trusted her, so I trusted you.

04:16.583 --> 04:21.916
I mean, if that woman loved you,

04:21.916 --> 04:26.166
if she trusted you,
fucking fool to lose her the way you did.

04:26.958 --> 04:31.041
Much as I lost after what you did,
and I lost a lot, damn near everything,

04:32.416 --> 04:35.208
it sustained me a bit...

04:37.625 --> 04:40.291
knowing you lost her.

04:43.041 --> 04:47.041
<i>And this was the reason that long ago
In this kingdom by the sea</i>

04:48.666 --> 04:52.541
<i>A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee</i>

04:52.541 --> 04:54.375
You're the fucking wind, Shakespeare.

04:54.375 --> 04:58.083
<i>So that her highborn kinsmen came
Bore her away from me</i>

04:58.083 --> 05:00.166
<i>To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom...</i>

05:00.166 --> 05:01.958
- Oh, shut up.
<i>- ...by the sea</i>

05:01.958 --> 05:04.208
Don't you ever get tired
of hearing yourself talk?

05:04.208 --> 05:07.958
Can't imagine how she
hung on so long, frankly.

05:07.958 --> 05:12.916
I say to people all the time,
"There's no such thing as a good Usher."

05:14.958 --> 05:16.958
But there was. One.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.000
Annabel Lee Usher.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.416
The only good Usher,
and you chased her away.

05:26.333 --> 05:29.291
Wrong. My granddaughter, Lenore.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.916
The best of us.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.208
And so like her grandmother too.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.375
All the best of Annabel Lee without...

05:47.916 --> 05:49.166
without the broken heart.

05:50.791 --> 05:52.791
[thunder rumbling]

05:58.666 --> 06:00.666
Fuck it. [exhales]

06:02.333 --> 06:04.583
Uh, I'm glad you liked Annabel...

06:06.125 --> 06:09.791
but she's gone,
she's been gone a long, long time,

06:09.791 --> 06:13.416
and I would be lying if I said
I never wondered

06:13.416 --> 06:16.333
- how the fuck did this happen.
- How the fuck did this happen?

06:16.333 --> 06:20.375
We paid how much for security
standing right outside her fucking door?

06:20.375 --> 06:23.208
And he didn't think to knock
when he heard glass breaking?

06:23.708 --> 06:25.916
What about the launch?
You were in the fucking room.

06:25.916 --> 06:27.625
[Arthur] We had ten people.

06:27.625 --> 06:31.083
And not one of them could stop this woman
from leaving the building?

06:31.083 --> 06:34.416
Not one could stop my daughter
from smashing a TV and assaulting my wife?

06:34.416 --> 06:38.916
Not one single person lifted a finger
when she went home and...

06:40.166 --> 06:43.166
The home was secure, I can't explain it.

06:43.958 --> 06:48.458
I had my... my hands on her.

06:48.458 --> 06:52.500
I felt her go apart like cold steam.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.958
Fuck! Stop it. Stop. Stop it! Shut up!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.291
Fuck's sake!

06:57.875 --> 07:00.541
Think like professionals
for a goddamn minute. Please.

07:02.750 --> 07:03.625
[exhales]

07:03.625 --> 07:05.125
The board's making its move.

07:06.666 --> 07:08.083
There's gonna be a vote.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.500
The board is just math.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.750
We've got blackmail material.
Strangle it in the crib.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.250
Oh, it's out of the crib,
it's starting college.

07:17.250 --> 07:21.916
Well, use the good stuff. Emergency.
Break glass. They'll fall in line.

07:21.916 --> 07:23.500
Some. Not all.

07:23.500 --> 07:28.875
Freddie is the swing vote.
Way I see it, he's key to the play.

07:31.750 --> 07:32.916
Get him in here.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.208
[door opens and closes]

07:41.208 --> 07:44.041
<i>- </i>  [Arthur] <i>He deserves better, Madeline.
- </i>  [Madeline] <i>Hmm.</i>

07:44.541 --> 07:47.583
[Arthur] <i>I'm a realist,
and I agree he is compromised.</i>

07:48.750 --> 07:51.000
<i>But he is a great man.</i>

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
He has an untreatable, incurable disease
that impairs his judgment.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.041
Right there, that takes him out of play.

08:00.125 --> 08:03.875
I am close, Arthur,
my algorithm project is so close.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.500
Do you know what that means?

08:05.500 --> 08:10.875
We could take this company out of pills,
out of poison, into tech.

08:10.875 --> 08:15.875
AI. Artificial consciousness,
virtual immortality.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.458
You take that to the board.

08:17.458 --> 08:22.875
You tell them that if I'm in the chair,
I take this company into the future,

08:22.875 --> 08:24.708
leave all of this behind us.

08:24.708 --> 08:27.375
The whole rotten legacy
goes out with Roderick,

08:27.375 --> 08:29.708
and we rebrand as a tech company.

08:29.708 --> 08:31.916
I imagine they'd find that appealing.

08:31.916 --> 08:33.166
I imagine they would.

08:34.958 --> 08:36.958
And I imagine this isn't easy for you.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.875
It's the hardest thing
I've ever had to say out loud.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.625
[Morrie wheezing]

09:09.541 --> 09:12.541
[wheezing intensifies]

09:21.791 --> 09:22.875
[Morrie weakly] Fred...

09:25.500 --> 09:26.500
Freddie.

09:28.541 --> 09:29.958
You must be feeling it a bit.

09:34.583 --> 09:39.291
[wheezing] Sweetie, you need to stop.

09:41.875 --> 09:44.083
- [Frederick whistling]
- Honey.

09:44.083 --> 09:49.708
No. Honey. Please, no. No. No.

09:50.041 --> 09:51.625
[wheezes]

09:55.625 --> 09:57.708
[sighs] Works so fast, doesn't it?

10:00.041 --> 10:02.208
[snorts, sighs]

10:02.916 --> 10:03.958
Oh.

10:03.958 --> 10:07.000
I heard Tamerlane killed herself
with a fireplace poker and,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.958
I swear to God, I can't...
I can't figure out what that means.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.916
I mean, how do you...
How do you even do that?

10:14.916 --> 10:15.750
[sighs]

10:23.000 --> 10:25.500
I knew I wanted to marry you
the first time we met.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.833
Do you remember? At the photoshoot?

10:28.791 --> 10:31.666
You came up to me, and I'd been approached

10:31.666 --> 10:34.541
and chatted up by grifters
and groupies before,

10:34.541 --> 10:37.625
but you smiled and it was so real.

10:38.833 --> 10:40.708
And I asked you why you did it,

10:40.708 --> 10:44.041
and you said that you saw me
standing there alone and you thought,

10:44.041 --> 10:47.750
"That looks like a guy
who could use a friend." [chuckles]

10:49.166 --> 10:50.125
And you were right.

10:52.166 --> 10:53.166
That smile.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.958
The smile stole my heart.

11:00.666 --> 11:03.000
Do you know what the headline was
that morning?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.333
When I took my board seat
from my predecessor?

11:07.041 --> 11:11.166
Business section of <i>The Times.</i>
"From ruthless to toothless."

11:12.125 --> 11:13.291
Is that how you see me?

11:14.333 --> 11:15.333
Toothless?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.291
[phone ringing]

11:21.041 --> 11:22.041
Yeah.

11:23.666 --> 11:25.333
Yeah, yeah. Oh.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.958
Yeah. Now? Okay. Okay.

11:31.750 --> 11:32.958
It's an emergency.

11:34.166 --> 11:37.041
Dad needs me. I'll be back when I can.

11:37.041 --> 11:38.250
Maybe we'll talk then.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.041
[sniffling]

11:45.916 --> 11:47.750
Where did you put your wedding ring?

11:49.250 --> 11:51.875
It wasn't on your hand.
I saw footage from the party.

11:52.416 --> 11:55.791
I got some of your things back.
Your purse, your effects.

11:55.791 --> 11:57.333
Your... Your fucking phone.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.791
But no ring.
Where did you put the ring, Morrie?

12:03.125 --> 12:04.125
Don't move.

12:07.458 --> 12:10.208
- Don't make excuses!
- I am working on it.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.458
Apparently not.
The building is still standing.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.875
I've had other things on my mind, Dad.
Funerals--

12:14.875 --> 12:18.708
I told you, call the Jersey boys,
and get it done.

12:18.708 --> 12:21.666
I will. It's just a building,
I don't know why it matters.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.875
It matters because I have to count on you.

12:23.875 --> 12:26.666
It's a fucking crime scene
with our family's name all over it.

12:26.666 --> 12:28.458
Your brother's blood all over it.

12:28.458 --> 12:31.958
It matters because if I can't count on you
to do the building,

12:31.958 --> 12:34.416
then I can't count on you
for the little things,

12:34.416 --> 12:37.083
which means I can't count on you
for the big things,

12:37.083 --> 12:39.500
and I have to count on you, Freddie.
I have to.

12:41.041 --> 12:43.041
You're it, you see?
You're the fucking swing vote.

12:43.791 --> 12:44.958
The board's swinging?

12:48.500 --> 12:49.625
They haven't called you yet.

12:53.333 --> 12:54.500
[sighs]

12:56.166 --> 12:57.833
This is it, Freddie.

12:59.583 --> 13:02.375
They're all gone,
and it's all about to fall apart.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.458
So, I need to count on you.

13:05.458 --> 13:07.625
And when they call, and they will call,

13:07.625 --> 13:10.083
you just don't pick up,
that's the best message.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.750
And if they corner you in the street,
you tell them, "I'm Frederick Usher,

13:14.750 --> 13:18.041
I'm the repository of the hopes and dreams
of a fucking empire."

13:18.041 --> 13:20.333
"So take your
treacherous bullshit elsewhere."

13:21.750 --> 13:22.666
Can you do that?

13:24.291 --> 13:25.250
I can.

13:38.375 --> 13:41.041
[doctor] <i>I mean,
this is a very unpleasant process.</i>

13:41.041 --> 13:43.541
In fact,
for the symptoms you're describing,

13:43.541 --> 13:47.083
your husband would probably say
upping the dose would smooth you over.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.625
Not asking him. I'm asking you.

13:52.458 --> 13:56.625
I'm on what?
Two thousand milligrams of Ligodone a day?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.875
The second highest dose
you've ever heard of is...

13:59.875 --> 14:02.541
- Thirteen hundred.
- Thirteen hundred? Right.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.416
And then this happens
and they want to up it,

14:06.416 --> 14:08.958
and I know you work for Fortunato, I know,

14:08.958 --> 14:11.916
but you're still my doctor, right?

14:11.916 --> 14:13.125
Yes, of course.

14:16.708 --> 14:17.791
Do you have kids?

14:18.625 --> 14:19.833
- Yes.
- Stepkids?

14:20.416 --> 14:21.250
Mmm-hmm.

14:22.958 --> 14:24.375
They ever call you a junkie?

14:27.291 --> 14:28.666
No.

14:30.416 --> 14:31.416
Mine did.

14:33.208 --> 14:34.333
They're all gone now.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.125
You watch three coffins
being lowered into the ground,

14:38.875 --> 14:42.000
two more on the way,
and you can't help it.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.750
It just makes you think, you know,
life is so fucking short.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.041
And the thing I keep going back to...

14:53.083 --> 14:57.708
is that Ligodone is more like heroin
than any other drug I've ever been on.

14:59.375 --> 15:03.875
Well, Ligodone has a lower incidence
of addiction if used correctly.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.125
Come on. It's just me and you here.

15:06.125 --> 15:11.791
So, tell me, how do I get off this
perfectly safe, non-addictive drug?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.041
[sighs]

15:18.041 --> 15:20.166
Very, very slowly.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.500
[Frederick] <i>I see.</i>

15:24.500 --> 15:29.750
Yes, well, I am the repository
of the hopes and dreams of an empire,

15:29.750 --> 15:33.208
so I'm happy you're
thinking of the future.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.458
- [Morrie wheezing]
- [exhales]

15:36.416 --> 15:37.708
Wow. [laughs]

15:38.666 --> 15:42.291
It is happening. [laughs]

15:42.291 --> 15:43.375
[snorts]

15:44.791 --> 15:46.166
[exhales]

15:49.541 --> 15:50.458
Hey, it's Fredso.

15:50.458 --> 15:54.583
Yeah, uh, listen,
I know we're all set for next week,

15:54.583 --> 15:58.041
but things are moving fast here,
and things are happening for me,

15:58.041 --> 16:00.333
and I really need that building
to come down.

16:00.333 --> 16:04.125
I need it done, like, today. Tonight.

16:04.125 --> 16:06.625
Well, I... I don't care about
the fucking blasting permit.

16:06.625 --> 16:09.000
Get me a ball and a fucking crane.

16:09.666 --> 16:13.166
Because I fucking asked you to.
Because I'm the Usher ascendant.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.000
Yeah. No...

16:17.916 --> 16:21.583
The Jersey boys listen to Roderick,
and the Jersey boys listen to me.

16:22.166 --> 16:25.083
Yes, I will be there.
I want to see that building come down.

16:25.833 --> 16:26.666
Okay?

16:27.458 --> 16:29.208
Ha! [sniffles]

16:29.208 --> 16:32.041
Did you hear how fast he changed his tune?

16:32.041 --> 16:34.166
[snorts, groans]

16:34.166 --> 16:35.666
It's amazing.

16:35.666 --> 16:39.541
My whole life, you know,
they won't take me seriously,

16:39.541 --> 16:42.333
and then, suddenly, you're the new CEO...

16:42.333 --> 16:43.666
[laughs]

16:43.666 --> 16:46.833
...and everybody
is fucking so accommodating.

16:47.833 --> 16:51.166
Well, almost everyone. [sighs]

16:51.166 --> 16:52.583
You, Morrie...

16:53.916 --> 16:55.333
[Morrie wheezing]

16:55.333 --> 16:58.083
You know one thing
Dad was really big about?

16:59.291 --> 17:01.333
It was a lesson that he taught us all.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.666
One of the first things he taught us.

17:03.666 --> 17:06.041
No! Frederick! No!

17:06.041 --> 17:07.958
If you wanna test a bond...

17:09.458 --> 17:11.333
- No!
- You don't really need to break it.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.500
No!

17:12.500 --> 17:15.125
You just crack it a little.

17:16.125 --> 17:20.375
Now, he put me one rung
higher on the ladder than Tammy

17:20.375 --> 17:22.333
and he sat back and watched.

17:24.541 --> 17:28.333
Cracked, but it didn't break.
It did make it stronger.

17:31.250 --> 17:36.083
Second lesson Dad was big on
was getting your house in order.

17:36.666 --> 17:39.000
- [sighs]
- [Morrie wheezing]

17:39.000 --> 17:40.583
You don't have to be a tyrant,

17:41.333 --> 17:44.333
but if you don't want to be
consistently cruel,

17:44.333 --> 17:49.083
then you have to be sufficiently brutal
at least once to establish authority.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.833
[sighs]

17:57.500 --> 17:59.208
Your fucking smile.

18:02.125 --> 18:05.291
I don't want to be consistently cruel,
that's not me.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.916
I won't break our bond.
You already cracked it.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.416
So I've just got to put our house
back in order.

18:18.458 --> 18:21.458
I'll strike one solid blow,
sufficiently brutal.

18:23.125 --> 18:26.541
So, let's do this once.

18:27.833 --> 18:29.083
Let's do it fast.

18:30.875 --> 18:33.875
Let's do it quiet.
And then we can start to heal.

18:37.958 --> 18:38.791
[gasps]

18:40.791 --> 18:41.791
[sighs]

18:42.416 --> 18:43.416
I've gotta go.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.625
I've got another house to put into order.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.208
[sighs] Oh.

18:48.208 --> 18:51.083
While I'm there, I'll look for your ring.
Maybe it's still there.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.166
If not, I'll get you a new one.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.958
But if I do find it, I'll bring it home.

18:57.625 --> 18:59.666
And if you ever take it off again...

19:01.291 --> 19:04.000
I'll weld it to your fucking finger.

19:04.666 --> 19:06.125
[phone ringing]

19:11.291 --> 19:12.416
Yeah? You good?

19:24.000 --> 19:25.333
[metal clangs]

19:30.875 --> 19:32.958
Don't you fucking say that to me, Vinnie.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.958
That ball is gonna swing
at 8:00 p.m. tonight.

19:35.958 --> 19:38.416
That building is coming down
or else I'm gonna...

19:38.416 --> 19:40.250
I'm gonna come over there,

19:40.250 --> 19:43.666
and I'm gonna pull out your fucking teeth
with a pair of pliers.

19:44.791 --> 19:46.083
[door slams]

19:46.083 --> 19:48.458
Dad. Where are you going?

19:49.125 --> 19:50.458
Got some work stuff to do.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.583
Can we talk first?

19:52.583 --> 19:53.666
Sure, peanut.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.625
I found this place. It's fantastic.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.625
Best in the country for burn treatments,
chemical burns.

19:59.625 --> 20:03.166
I mean, they've got top-notch
skin-graft work and everything on campus.

20:03.791 --> 20:07.166
Plus, I talked to one of the doctors.
They said they could take her.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.541
Why the fuck would you do that?

20:09.541 --> 20:13.208
I'm sorry, why the fuck
would you do that, sweetheart?

20:14.041 --> 20:15.500
She'd be better off someplace else.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.250
Lenore, we've talked about this.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.125
Where are they?

20:21.875 --> 20:22.791
Who?

20:22.791 --> 20:26.458
The specialists. The doctors.
Everyone you promised would be here.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.291
When you're at school,
they come here a lot of the time.

20:29.291 --> 20:31.416
- But she is fine.
- I don't believe you.

20:31.416 --> 20:34.416
And you're... You're not right, Dad.

20:34.416 --> 20:36.291
You smell like shit
and you look like shit,

20:36.291 --> 20:37.875
- and you're acting weird.
- Watch it.

20:38.416 --> 20:39.833
Do you know who you're talking to?

20:39.833 --> 20:42.958
Mom is not okay. You are not okay.
None of this is okay.

20:42.958 --> 20:45.750
And I found a place that can
actually take care of her,

20:45.750 --> 20:49.958
- and we can take her there tomorrow.
- I can't do this. You need to stop.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.750
- Stop it, please. Stop! Stop it!
- All you have to do is call.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.083
Stop fucking talking!

20:54.083 --> 20:57.291
If anybody spoke to me like this,
there would be repercussions!

20:57.291 --> 21:00.625
You do not get a free pass
because you're my daughter!

21:03.333 --> 21:04.500
[exhales]

21:04.500 --> 21:06.250
I want to talk to her specialist.

21:08.125 --> 21:08.958
[sniffles]

21:10.750 --> 21:12.375
Your mother is resting,

21:12.375 --> 21:14.958
and you will leave her alone
while I'm gone.

21:14.958 --> 21:17.000
And I will deal with you later
when I get back.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.083
[breath trembling]

21:33.000 --> 21:35.291
Ma? Ma, can you hear me in there?

21:43.583 --> 21:45.125
[thudding]

21:50.083 --> 21:54.833
Look, I've got to tell you, those noises
are starting to really bother me.

21:55.916 --> 21:58.083
- You say that's Madeline.
- [Roderick] It is.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.000
[phone vibrates]

21:59.000 --> 22:01.041
I think we ought to go down
and make sure she's...

22:01.708 --> 22:05.166
- And let me guess. That's Lenore.
- Bingo.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.833
I don't know what you're playing at
with me tonight,

22:07.833 --> 22:11.083
- but I've just about had enough.
- We're almost there, Auggie.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.000
You know what? No.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.833
- Uh, please. Sit down.
- [recorder clicks]

22:19.833 --> 22:23.833
I'm wondering
why you're dragging this out,

22:23.833 --> 22:26.666
why the cat and mouse,
and I know the answer.

22:26.666 --> 22:29.625
Because you're getting
something out of it.

22:29.625 --> 22:30.750
It's not like that.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.708
And if you're getting something out of it,
whatever it is,

22:34.291 --> 22:36.291
- I don't have to give it to you.
- Please.

22:36.291 --> 22:40.458
Goodnight, Roderick.
And good luck with the dementia.

22:43.125 --> 22:45.041
You'll have me on murder.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.250
That's where we're going.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.333
You'll have me dead to rights on murder.

22:54.708 --> 22:57.416
More than one, actually.

23:03.875 --> 23:07.916
And here's where I stop in my tracks,
slowly return to the chair,

23:07.916 --> 23:10.708
sit down and start the recorder again.

23:12.083 --> 23:15.041
That's what I do now, right Roderick?
In your little script.

23:15.041 --> 23:18.041
[chuckling] I mean, it'd be nice.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.333
But... [sighs] that's the thing, isn't it?

23:22.666 --> 23:26.333
We've been here before,
you and me, right here. In fact--

23:26.333 --> 23:28.083
[clock clanging, ticking]

23:37.958 --> 23:39.333
You see that too?

23:40.583 --> 23:41.916
You're trying to scare me.

23:43.625 --> 23:44.625
No.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.083
No.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.291
That's Freddie, I expect.

23:54.500 --> 23:58.083
They've been at me all night.
Make sure I get their stories right.

24:00.708 --> 24:04.500
Which is... It's fantastic. [chuckling]

24:05.583 --> 24:08.500
As my personal hell
is being micro-managed.

24:09.250 --> 24:14.791
No, what happens now, see,
is you start talking.

24:14.791 --> 24:19.083
And then all of a sudden
I spot a little hint of Freddie,

24:19.083 --> 24:21.791
but I try to ignore it
because you can't see him,

24:21.791 --> 24:26.125
and then he manages to get
a good jolt in there

24:26.125 --> 24:30.125
for my benefit while you look at me
like I'm insane.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.750
I'm not insane.

24:31.750 --> 24:34.875
And while CADASIL is no picnic,
it certainly isn't this.

24:38.583 --> 24:41.916
No, I'm afraid you're ringside
for my reckoning, old friend.

24:41.916 --> 24:45.041
- [metallic creaking]
- [ticking stops]

24:45.041 --> 24:48.458
And any second,
Freddie is going to peek up from...

24:50.250 --> 24:52.416
behind the chair,
and show off his C-section--

24:52.416 --> 24:55.000
Honey! [laughs]

24:55.708 --> 24:56.708
Hi.

24:57.416 --> 24:58.250
Daddy.

25:00.958 --> 25:01.958
Daddy.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.041
[Annabel laughs]

25:06.708 --> 25:07.541
Oh.

25:16.958 --> 25:17.791
[chuckles]

25:17.791 --> 25:22.166
We had to come for your big day.
Wanted Freddie to see his daddy be a hero.

25:22.916 --> 25:23.750
[chuckles]

25:33.541 --> 25:34.625
[squelching]

25:42.791 --> 25:43.708
[Tammy] Mama.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.916
[Roderick] You guys
were gonna stay at home.

25:45.916 --> 25:49.125
I know, but these two thought Daddy
could use a little support.

25:49.125 --> 25:51.541
- Didn't we, Freddie?
- You should've stayed at home.

25:51.541 --> 25:54.541
- Hey! You guys made it.
- [Annabel] Yeah. Wouldn't miss it.

25:55.291 --> 25:56.958
Hey, remember in there,

25:56.958 --> 25:59.500
if you get scared or feel alone,
we are right here, okay?

25:59.500 --> 26:01.625
On the other side of the wall.
We're here with you.

26:01.625 --> 26:04.791
Yeah, why don't you come sit with me?
Let him get to it.

26:08.750 --> 26:09.708
[Auguste] Mmm.

26:10.583 --> 26:12.166
- You ready?
- Yeah.

26:17.583 --> 26:20.375
- You got this?
- Yeah. I got this.

26:24.291 --> 26:27.416
[man] <i>We are on the record
at 1:32 p.m.</i>

26:27.416 --> 26:32.666
Today is Thursday, December 20th, 1979.

26:33.791 --> 26:38.375
Mr. Usher, I'd like you to have a look
at Exhibits 2 and 3 here.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.041
Do you recognize that document?

26:40.041 --> 26:41.125
Objection.

26:41.916 --> 26:42.750
Go ahead.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.458
She's going to do that all day,
just getting it on the record.

26:45.458 --> 26:46.625
Doesn't matter with us.

26:47.166 --> 26:51.333
Uh, okay.
Um, it's a consent for care form. A CFC.

26:51.916 --> 26:53.666
And you deal with these routinely?

26:53.666 --> 26:55.708
I do. Since my promotion.

26:55.708 --> 26:57.666
And what purpose does the form serve?

26:57.666 --> 26:58.750
[lawyer] Objection.

27:00.166 --> 27:01.291
Uh...

27:01.291 --> 27:04.875
It... It's an agreement between the patient,
the provider and the company

27:04.875 --> 27:08.625
that lists all risks and side-effects
associated with the proposed treatment.

27:08.625 --> 27:11.000
Anything strike you as unusual
about that document?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.041
[lawyer] Objection.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.333
Not particularly, no.

27:17.208 --> 27:20.208
I mean, just the fact that it's here.
These are confidential.

27:20.208 --> 27:21.833
These are property of the company.

27:21.833 --> 27:26.291
- [DA] Nothing at all unusual?
- No, it's pretty standard boilerplate.

27:26.291 --> 27:27.375
Um...

27:27.375 --> 27:29.458
It's unfortunate
we couldn't get a family member

27:29.458 --> 27:32.125
to sign along with the patient,
given their age,

27:32.125 --> 27:35.708
but, as you can see here, it was witnessed
by a representative of the company.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.583
Have you ever signed as a witness
on a CFC?

27:37.583 --> 27:38.541
Yes, I have.

27:38.541 --> 27:41.583
- [papers rustling]
- And is this your signature?

27:43.583 --> 27:44.416
Yes, it is.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.250
[papers rustling]

27:48.250 --> 27:49.541
How about this one?

27:50.583 --> 27:52.541
[Roderick] Yeah. That too. That's mine.

27:53.125 --> 27:57.208
To be clear,
you're telling us that you were aware of

27:57.208 --> 28:00.750
and signed this form on this day?

28:03.833 --> 28:05.041
- Yes.
- Objection.

28:05.041 --> 28:06.666
[lawyer] He's your witness, Pam.

28:06.666 --> 28:07.875
Mr. Usher...

28:10.500 --> 28:12.000
[whispering indistinctly]

28:12.666 --> 28:17.375
Mr. Usher, did Rufus Griswold at any time
exert any pressure on you,

28:17.375 --> 28:20.083
written or verbal,
to sign or falsify documents?

28:21.333 --> 28:22.166
No.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.458
Has he spoken to you at all
about today's deposition?

28:25.458 --> 28:26.500
[Roderick] Not at all.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.416
[DA] Has anyone at Fortunato
spoken to you about today's deposition?

28:29.416 --> 28:30.958
[Roderick] No. Not at all.

28:33.416 --> 28:37.708
[DA] Mr. Usher, I will remind you,
you are under oath,

28:37.708 --> 28:41.083
you agreed to appear here today
as a witness for this office.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.000
Yes. Well...

28:44.583 --> 28:45.583
[clears throat] Um...

28:46.708 --> 28:48.916
Your man there wouldn't leave us alone.

28:49.958 --> 28:54.083
He stopped by my home
on multiple occasions pressing this issue.

28:54.791 --> 28:56.833
So, yes, I agreed to appear.

28:57.750 --> 29:00.375
Call me a witness,
call me a representative of the company,

29:00.375 --> 29:03.583
call me whatever you like,
I'd hope by appearing here

29:03.583 --> 29:07.916
and verifying for the record
what I'd said to Mr. Dupin in privacy,

29:07.916 --> 29:12.333
that he would do me the kindness
of letting my family be in peace.

29:13.541 --> 29:15.875
Frankly, I didn't want to use this word,

29:15.875 --> 29:19.083
but the treatment of my family
in the name of whatever vendetta

29:19.083 --> 29:23.333
Mr. Dupin has for Rufus Griswold
borders on harassment.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.791
That's what I came here to say.

29:30.625 --> 29:31.625
Auggie.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.083
What's...

29:33.958 --> 29:34.958
Wait...

29:36.083 --> 29:38.000
- What's happening?
- Don't say anything.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.166
- What are they doing?
- Don't say anything.

29:40.166 --> 29:42.833
- Your husband's under arrest for perjury.
- Perjury?

29:42.833 --> 29:44.291
I told you to stay at home.

29:44.958 --> 29:45.791
Roderick!

29:45.791 --> 29:48.500
Don't say a word. Not another word.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.541
Not here. I will meet you at home.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.666
Hi. Madeline Usher.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.666
Do you have a minute? Can we talk?

30:00.333 --> 30:02.875
[Annabel] <i>What the fuck?
You knew this was gonna happen?</i>

30:02.875 --> 30:04.083
Of course.

30:04.083 --> 30:06.750
- My husband is in jail.
- He'll be out before dinner.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.291
You think Fortunato
is going to let him sit there?

30:09.291 --> 30:13.250
As of today he's the most
important employee at that company.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.333
They will have him out
before you can blink.

30:15.333 --> 30:16.541
He's charged with perjury.

30:16.541 --> 30:19.875
And that won't stick either.
He never signed an affidavit.

30:20.666 --> 30:22.791
It's Dupin's word against ours.

30:22.791 --> 30:25.166
What the fuck is wrong with you?

30:26.458 --> 30:29.458
Roderick was gonna do the right thing.
He was gonna be a hero.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.333
That's what I told my children.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.666
He did the right thing,
you fucking simpleton.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.250
The DA's embarrassed,
but he's not an idiot,

30:37.250 --> 30:40.000
and once he's staring down
the whole Fortunato legal machine

30:40.000 --> 30:41.875
without a single witness,

30:41.875 --> 30:44.375
his whole case is just
a handful of stolen documents.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.541
He will fold.

30:46.125 --> 30:47.791
Perjury too. He can't prove it.

30:48.625 --> 30:52.458
Right now, there is one name

30:52.458 --> 30:58.000
on the mind of every board member,
investor and executive at Fortunato.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.208
[liquid pours]

31:00.125 --> 31:01.125
Roderick Usher.

31:02.083 --> 31:03.541
He is a fucking hero.

31:04.416 --> 31:06.541
You're gonna be swimming in money

31:06.541 --> 31:09.416
and promotions and protections
by lunchtime tomorrow.

31:09.416 --> 31:11.416
You'll be in a new house by Christmas.

31:11.416 --> 31:14.958
You would have been on unemployment
tomorrow if we'd done it your way,

31:14.958 --> 31:18.166
and Fortunato would have sued you
into a fucking crater.

31:20.958 --> 31:21.958
Jesus.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.416
I thought it was an act.

31:27.166 --> 31:30.541
I figured you just played the housewife

31:30.541 --> 31:33.916
so you could keep a roof over your head.

31:33.916 --> 31:37.083
Spread your legs or suck his dick
twice a week and you're set.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.291
You never have to work a day in your life.

31:39.291 --> 31:42.166
And I thought, "Good for her,
she found her angle," but...

31:43.625 --> 31:45.791
[sighs] ...this is really you.

31:47.083 --> 31:48.083
Isn't it?

31:52.291 --> 31:54.708
I thought you only existed in the movies.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.000
You are so...

32:06.625 --> 32:08.583
small, Madeline.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.625
[Tammy crying]

32:10.625 --> 32:11.666
[sniffles]

32:13.875 --> 32:15.166
Your baby's crying.

32:50.875 --> 32:52.708
[door creaking]

33:27.083 --> 33:28.750
All right, I know you're here.

33:39.750 --> 33:40.916
[metallic clinking]

33:52.750 --> 33:53.833
[Verna] Have a seat.

33:59.041 --> 34:00.458
These aren't for us, technically.

34:00.458 --> 34:03.416
They're for the boys later on,
but I don't think they'll mind.

34:04.416 --> 34:05.375
Please.

34:06.291 --> 34:07.416
Can I get you a drink?

34:09.166 --> 34:10.208
No, thank you.

34:13.416 --> 34:16.666
He's been coming here a lot
over the last few weeks.

34:17.375 --> 34:18.875
Not sure he even knows why.

34:20.083 --> 34:21.708
And you should see the basement.

34:21.708 --> 34:24.833
He's got boxes of stuff down there.

34:24.833 --> 34:25.916
More every day.

34:27.333 --> 34:32.833
He just sits here and he drinks
and he cries sometimes.

34:34.166 --> 34:35.166
Sad to watch.

34:35.791 --> 34:37.958
A man like that reduced to such a cliché.

34:39.375 --> 34:40.833
It really is you.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.000
It's amazing how much I've denied.

34:47.625 --> 34:48.875
But it is you.

34:50.791 --> 34:52.833
And somehow I knew you'd be here.

34:52.833 --> 34:56.416
Well, I left you the address,
don't pat yourself too hard on the back.

35:00.875 --> 35:03.750
Go ahead. Say your piece.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.750
I want to ask you to stop.

35:06.708 --> 35:10.041
Come on. Ask me? That isn't you.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.458
And frankly,
I think you've forgotten what I am.

35:12.458 --> 35:14.458
Fine then. I want to renegotiate.

35:14.458 --> 35:15.750
- You can't.
- Why not?

35:15.750 --> 35:17.916
- The ink is dry.
- For him or for me?

35:17.916 --> 35:18.875
Madeline...

35:18.875 --> 35:21.291
Words got us into this,
words can get us out.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.083
You blaming Roderick or rhetoric?

35:23.083 --> 35:25.958
I want new terms,
and I shall have new terms.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.041
Or have you forgotten what I am?

35:28.041 --> 35:32.125
There she is. Ah, there's my Cleopatra.

35:32.125 --> 35:33.625
Everything has a price.

35:34.166 --> 35:36.666
Every negotiation's a point of entry.

35:36.666 --> 35:40.916
Every deal is simply
an expression of will. Mutual will.

35:40.916 --> 35:42.583
We can sort this.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.291
Woman to woman.

35:45.291 --> 35:46.541
I'm not a woman.

35:46.541 --> 35:50.666
You know what I am capable of.
You know what I have done.

35:50.666 --> 35:52.083
You know who I am.

35:52.083 --> 35:55.958
You're a collection of impeccable,
elaborate masks

35:55.958 --> 35:57.916
in orbit of a stunted heart.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.458
[Verna] That was cruel. I apologize.

36:10.666 --> 36:13.625
There are certain things
one shouldn't have to face in life.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.916
Time enough for self-reflection after.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.625
Yes. I know who you are.

36:20.875 --> 36:21.750
And were.

36:22.583 --> 36:24.166
And who you could have been.

36:25.041 --> 36:29.083
I see all three.
Standing shoulder to shoulder.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.291
And together, they break my heart.

36:34.958 --> 36:36.666
Please. Sit.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.666
I apologize.

36:53.333 --> 36:54.500
Under the bridge.

36:55.916 --> 36:59.791
I was saying,
I know who you are, Madeline.

36:59.791 --> 37:01.583
You're one of my favorites.

37:02.500 --> 37:05.791
And I understand.
You find an adversary, you kill them.

37:06.333 --> 37:09.708
You find a hurdle,
you jump it or dismantle it.

37:10.458 --> 37:13.375
You find a locked door, you pry it open.

37:16.375 --> 37:18.916
Mom? Mom!

37:20.708 --> 37:22.708
[Morrie wheezing]

37:25.208 --> 37:26.333
[Roderick] <i>This is insane.</i>

37:28.125 --> 37:30.708
- Ludicrous. I won't hear anymore.
- [Juno] Ludicrous?

37:30.708 --> 37:32.250
I'm talking about getting clean.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.166
Don't be stupid.
Can you imagine what that would look like?

37:35.916 --> 37:39.041
My own wife trying to get off my own drug.
It's a PR nightmare.

37:39.041 --> 37:40.333
I just want to be off it.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.916
Then you'll have no problem.

37:48.833 --> 37:49.791
It's not addictive.

37:52.041 --> 37:53.041
Okay then.

37:53.666 --> 37:54.583
It's not.

37:55.166 --> 37:57.125
But if you try to get off it,

37:57.875 --> 38:01.291
you can expect mood changes
and sleep changes and physical changes,

38:01.291 --> 38:06.666
flu symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
stomach cramping, reduced appetite,

38:06.666 --> 38:10.791
dilated pupils, blurry vision, shivering,

38:10.791 --> 38:13.750
goosebumps, rapid heartbeat,
high blood pressure,

38:13.750 --> 38:18.291
just imagine being so tired
you can't sleep.

38:18.291 --> 38:21.875
So exhausted that you can't relax.

38:21.875 --> 38:26.333
All soaked with feelings
of absolute desperation and dread.

38:26.333 --> 38:29.500
Basically, the closest analogy
I can think of is a fish

38:29.500 --> 38:32.666
being pulled out of water,
only at least the fish gets to die.

38:32.666 --> 38:33.583
I thought--

38:33.583 --> 38:36.541
Some people benefit
from rapid detox methods

38:36.541 --> 38:40.208
like clonidine, naltrexone or rapid
withdrawal under general anesthesia,

38:40.208 --> 38:42.416
but not with your dose.

38:42.416 --> 38:45.416
With your dose,
you've got to take it slow.

38:45.416 --> 38:47.375
10% reduction per month.

38:47.375 --> 38:51.750
You should be right as rain
in, um, three agonizing years.

38:51.750 --> 38:53.916
What the fuck have you done?

38:53.916 --> 38:56.041
Don't play me like that
or did I get you wrong?

38:56.041 --> 38:59.166
Haven't you sucked a few cocks
for a fix before we met?

38:59.166 --> 39:00.958
Or am I confusing you with somebody else?

39:01.625 --> 39:03.250
You're a monster, you know that?

39:06.041 --> 39:07.166
I married a monster.

39:13.541 --> 39:14.583
No, dear.

39:17.375 --> 39:18.791
I'm Victor Frankenstein.

39:20.791 --> 39:21.833
You're the monster.

39:23.166 --> 39:26.958
You are my perfect creation.

39:26.958 --> 39:32.458
What was left of you after that accident
was a corpse on a slab.

39:32.458 --> 39:36.916
And Ligodone was the lightning.
I threw the switch, you sat up and look...

39:38.750 --> 39:39.708
It's alive.

39:39.708 --> 39:40.791
I thought...

39:41.625 --> 39:42.708
[inhales sharply]

39:42.708 --> 39:44.375
I thought that you loved me.

39:44.375 --> 39:48.250
I... You are a miracle.

39:50.833 --> 39:55.500
Your body just... soaks it up.

39:55.500 --> 40:00.000
It's like nothing I've ever seen.
Like my drug is water and you're a flower.

40:00.000 --> 40:05.958
You are the most perfect
and beautiful thing I've ever seen.

40:07.166 --> 40:10.875
You know, a huge part of you is Ligodone.

40:13.958 --> 40:15.541
How could I not marry you?

40:22.166 --> 40:23.208
Three years?

40:25.666 --> 40:26.666
Okay.

40:27.541 --> 40:28.625
I can do three years.

40:30.125 --> 40:34.500
'Cause yeah,
I've had a hard life at times.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.041
And I've made mistakes,
but that's what I thought you saw in me.

40:40.833 --> 40:44.208
Because that shit made me fucking strong.

40:46.250 --> 40:52.625
So, I will take three years of hell
over a lifetime with you.

40:54.416 --> 40:55.416
Easy.

40:58.583 --> 41:01.000
You should know there's common ground
between us.

41:01.750 --> 41:04.333
You, your brother and I,
we share something.

41:05.250 --> 41:07.625
I recognized it the moment
I laid eyes on you.

41:09.000 --> 41:09.916
Pain.

41:10.833 --> 41:13.416
You might accuse me
of being the broker of suffering.

41:13.416 --> 41:14.916
I could say the same of you.

41:15.958 --> 41:18.166
But I consider myself more its witness.

41:20.166 --> 41:21.458
You're in pain.

41:22.166 --> 41:26.291
You're exhausted. Uncertain. Frightened.

41:27.041 --> 41:31.125
For the first time in years.
I can't take that pain from you.

41:32.083 --> 41:33.916
But I can give you something for it.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.125
And it's not a drug.

41:38.416 --> 41:41.500
Years ago, I offered you certainty.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.375
Tonight, clarity.

41:46.583 --> 41:47.791
No strings.

41:50.125 --> 41:51.458
I doubt that.

41:51.458 --> 41:53.541
Your brother,
you know what he would have been?

41:55.291 --> 41:56.458
A poet.

41:56.458 --> 41:57.666
[both chuckle]

41:57.666 --> 42:01.833
That's where his talent was.
A broke poet, sure.

42:01.833 --> 42:04.333
But frankly, is there another kind?

42:05.250 --> 42:07.000
He and I share that as well.

42:07.791 --> 42:09.375
We both understand that...

42:10.541 --> 42:15.125
language in its highest expression
is musical.

42:18.791 --> 42:19.833
So...

42:22.250 --> 42:24.375
Some clarity for you.

42:25.875 --> 42:30.416
What's a poem, after all,
if not a safe space for a difficult truth.

42:31.375 --> 42:32.458
Here's one.

42:33.666 --> 42:37.708
Came to me when you adorable little things
started building cities.

42:39.083 --> 42:41.250
I call it "The City in the Sea".

42:43.875 --> 42:48.041
<i>Lo! Death has reared himself a throne</i>

42:48.916 --> 42:53.666
<i>In a strange city lying alone</i>

42:53.666 --> 42:55.625
<i>Far down within the dim West</i>

42:55.625 --> 42:58.666
<i>Where the good and the bad
And the worst and the best</i>

42:58.666 --> 43:01.041
<i>Have gone to their eternal rest</i>

43:02.416 --> 43:04.875
<i>No rays from the holy Heaven come down</i>

43:04.875 --> 43:08.500
<i>On the long nighttime of that town</i>

43:10.166 --> 43:13.833
<i>But light from out the lurid sea</i>

43:13.833 --> 43:16.750
<i>Streams up the turrets silently</i>

43:17.500 --> 43:21.041
<i>Up domes, up spires, up kingly halls</i>

43:21.041 --> 43:23.916
<i>Up fanes, up Babylon-like walls</i>

43:24.583 --> 43:27.958
<i>Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers</i>

43:27.958 --> 43:31.333
<i>Of sculptured ivory and stone flowers</i>

43:32.166 --> 43:37.166
<i>Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie</i>

43:38.041 --> 43:39.000
Ah.

43:39.875 --> 43:43.208
<i>But lo, a stir is in the air!</i>

43:43.208 --> 43:45.208
[sirens wailing faintly]

43:45.208 --> 43:48.916
<i>The wave, there is a movement there!</i>

43:50.250 --> 43:53.500
<i>The waves have now a redder glow</i>

43:53.500 --> 43:57.125
<i>The hours are breathing, faint and low</i>

43:58.083 --> 44:01.708
<i>And when, amid no earthly moans</i>

44:02.541 --> 44:07.625
<i>Down, down that town shall settle hence</i>

44:08.416 --> 44:11.958
<i>Hell rising from a thousand thrones</i>

44:12.708 --> 44:15.458
<i>Shall do it reverence</i>

44:21.250 --> 44:24.083
I thought you were offering clarity.

44:26.708 --> 44:29.958
Let it steep a moment. It'll come to you.

44:44.541 --> 44:45.375
Freddie. Hey.

44:45.375 --> 44:48.666
Um, listen, we've got a couple
of small charges in there to help,

44:48.666 --> 44:52.250
but, you know, if we get caught on that,
I will tell them that you insisted.

44:52.250 --> 44:54.916
See, isn't it amazing
what you can accomplish

44:54.916 --> 44:57.625
- when you pull your head out of your ass.
- [sighs] Yeah.

44:58.166 --> 45:01.000
She's gonna go down,
but it's going to be slow and rough.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.958
- [Frederick] She'll come down?
- Yeah.

45:02.958 --> 45:04.208
[Frederick] Are you ready?

45:04.208 --> 45:05.833
Yes, we're ready to go.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.208
Let me have your radio.

45:07.208 --> 45:09.791
I need five minutes inside,
I have to do something.

45:09.791 --> 45:10.875
Oh, come on, man.

45:10.875 --> 45:13.333
You scrambled us here,
don't keep us waiting.

45:13.333 --> 45:15.375
I need five minutes.

45:15.375 --> 45:18.958
Then I'll give you an all-clear signal
and you can do whatever you do.

45:18.958 --> 45:21.541
Okay? Fuck's sake. Have a little patience.

45:33.708 --> 45:35.208
What a fucking joke.

45:35.208 --> 45:36.833
[sighs]

45:38.500 --> 45:39.958
Should have died here, honey.

45:41.375 --> 45:43.500
Would've made you an honest woman.

45:44.333 --> 45:46.125
[snorts] Ah.

45:47.791 --> 45:49.416
Ah. [inhales]

45:49.416 --> 45:52.041
Well, Prospero, my brother...

45:53.416 --> 45:54.958
one last thing to say to you.

45:56.166 --> 45:57.916
Rest in pee, fuck face.

45:59.125 --> 46:00.125
[groans]

46:01.666 --> 46:02.833
[sniffles]

46:07.875 --> 46:09.041
[urinating stops]

46:11.333 --> 46:12.750
What the fuck!

46:24.125 --> 46:26.125
[footsteps approaching]

46:35.333 --> 46:38.833
[Verna scoffs] Oh, honey.
This is embarrassing.

46:39.958 --> 46:42.208
At least close your pants.

46:42.208 --> 46:46.875
Otherwise it's just... Well,
it's humiliating enough, isn't it?

46:48.833 --> 46:50.916
No? Gonna let it fly?

46:52.458 --> 46:53.750
You're the boss, right?

46:54.833 --> 46:56.958
That's the nightshade paralytic. [sighs]

46:56.958 --> 46:57.916
[helmet clatters]

46:58.666 --> 47:00.833
You got a little carried away back there.

47:00.833 --> 47:02.083
And, strictly speaking,

47:02.083 --> 47:04.750
I try to never intervene
this directly, but...

47:05.541 --> 47:07.791
[chuckles] ...the pliers got me thinking.

47:08.416 --> 47:09.333
Fuck it.

47:12.833 --> 47:14.625
[phone ringing]

47:17.833 --> 47:18.833
Yeah? You good?

47:19.666 --> 47:20.791
More.

47:25.250 --> 47:26.333
More.

47:27.791 --> 47:28.916
More.

47:35.916 --> 47:38.000
Don't you fucking say that to me, Vinnie.

47:38.708 --> 47:40.958
That ball is gonna swing
at 8:00 p.m. tonight.

47:40.958 --> 47:43.458
That building is coming down
or else I'm gonna...

47:43.958 --> 47:45.375
I'm gonna come over there,

47:46.291 --> 47:49.833
and I'm gonna pull out your fucking teeth
with a pair of pliers.

48:00.541 --> 48:04.500
I don't normally like to get my hands
this dirty, but honey, you earned it.

48:04.958 --> 48:05.791
[radio crackles]

48:05.791 --> 48:08.250
[mimics Frederick's voice]
All clear, start the music.

48:08.958 --> 48:10.208
[Vinnie on radio] <i>You clear?</i>

48:10.208 --> 48:12.666
- [radio crackles]
- The fuck did I say? Swing it.

48:12.666 --> 48:14.875
- [radio beeps]
- [Vinnie faintly] All ready?

48:14.875 --> 48:17.041
[engine whirring]

48:17.041 --> 48:18.291
[in normal voice] A dentist.

48:19.416 --> 48:20.666
That's the funniest part.

48:21.541 --> 48:23.916
That's what you were gonna be
in the other life.

48:24.416 --> 48:28.041
You would have been a dentist.
And a pretty good one.

48:29.666 --> 48:30.708
And I don't know,

48:30.708 --> 48:36.375
I guess that made what you did
feel worse somehow.

48:36.375 --> 48:37.791
[ball whooshing]

48:37.791 --> 48:39.000
No need to panic.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.583
No need to worry
what's lurking around the corner.

48:42.583 --> 48:45.166
You've been scared your whole life.

48:45.166 --> 48:47.208
And now you get to put that down.

48:48.541 --> 48:53.375
It's here, Frederick.
I'm finally, finally here.

49:00.666 --> 49:04.333
The cool thing is, like,
nobody gets to see this.

49:05.125 --> 49:06.708
From this vantage point anyway.

49:08.375 --> 49:10.291
So, at least try to appreciate that.

49:10.291 --> 49:12.375
[metal clanging]

49:26.166 --> 49:27.541
That's not good.

49:44.416 --> 49:47.791
You know, I could have done this
just about any way I wanted to.

49:47.791 --> 49:49.375
[ball thuds]

49:49.375 --> 49:53.208
Could have had a heart attack in your car.
Coke would have teed that up nicely.

49:53.208 --> 49:54.333
[glasses shattering]

49:54.333 --> 49:55.875
Could have been hit by a bus.

49:58.541 --> 50:00.416
But then you had to bring her home.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.833
[ball thuds]

50:02.833 --> 50:06.375
And you had to grab the pliers.

50:08.333 --> 50:09.750
[metal creaking]

50:11.041 --> 50:12.583
[ball thudding]

50:18.458 --> 50:19.458
I'm gonna head out.

50:20.083 --> 50:21.625
I've got an appointment with your dad.

50:21.625 --> 50:23.125
[ball thuds]

50:26.750 --> 50:28.333
He did you wrong, Freddie.

50:30.708 --> 50:32.916
You only ever wanted to be loved by him.

50:33.958 --> 50:35.958
You only ever wanted his approval.

50:38.541 --> 50:40.458
[metal creaking]

50:41.125 --> 50:43.791
And it's still no fucking excuse.

51:01.958 --> 51:04.208
[metal creaking, clanging]

51:06.375 --> 51:07.375
[slashing]

51:12.666 --> 51:14.666
[building crumbling]

51:50.833 --> 51:51.958
Freddie's dead.

51:54.958 --> 51:57.166
That means there's just us left.

51:57.916 --> 52:01.375
You remember the deal.
You remember the terms.

52:02.541 --> 52:03.583
I know you do.

52:06.708 --> 52:09.625
"Into the world together,
out of the world together

52:09.625 --> 52:12.375
or there's no deal," that's what she said.

52:12.375 --> 52:14.375
There is only one way out.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.250
And I think you know that too.

52:21.458 --> 52:22.583
I love you.

52:24.041 --> 52:25.875
More than anyone in the world.

52:26.541 --> 52:27.375
[gasps]

52:28.333 --> 52:31.833
And now I need you to be a hero again.

52:31.833 --> 52:34.750
I need you to be my brother.

52:34.750 --> 52:38.833
- We need you... to be our hero.
- [sighs]

52:38.833 --> 52:40.041
[pills rattling]

52:42.541 --> 52:44.958
[sighing]

52:47.666 --> 52:50.375
These are the 80s. Ligodone 80 mill.

52:50.375 --> 52:53.041
And here's the thing,
once you start you can't stop.

52:53.041 --> 52:54.750
You have to take 'em all at once

52:54.750 --> 52:57.250
'cause if you stop it can hurt,
as you well know.

52:57.250 --> 52:59.875
But if you take it fast,
you won't feel it.

52:59.875 --> 53:01.958
- Your blood pressure will drop.
- [sighs]

53:01.958 --> 53:04.625
And you'll just... just go to sleep.

53:04.625 --> 53:05.708
[groans]

53:09.583 --> 53:11.541
- [pills rattling]
- Um...

53:11.541 --> 53:13.083
No other way?

53:13.083 --> 53:14.333
There's not.

53:15.208 --> 53:19.625
I have run it all down.
Every possible scenario.

53:19.625 --> 53:22.666
You trust me, you have always trusted me.

53:22.666 --> 53:26.125
This is the only one. This is it.

53:34.541 --> 53:36.500
Go ahead. You can do it.

53:40.583 --> 53:43.458
Now, that's a legend.

53:43.458 --> 53:45.666
- [coughs]
- That's a king.

53:45.666 --> 53:47.916
[sobs]

53:47.916 --> 53:49.375
You're saving us all.

53:49.375 --> 53:50.333
[exhales]

53:50.333 --> 53:51.916
[pills rattling]

53:54.083 --> 53:55.583
[Madeline] You're a legend.

53:57.583 --> 53:58.541
You're a king.

54:00.708 --> 54:02.583
You are saving us all.

54:07.875 --> 54:09.333
[footsteps approaching]

54:27.541 --> 54:29.541
[metallic clinking]

55:27.750 --> 55:29.750
[coughing]

55:30.541 --> 55:32.541
[retching]

55:33.958 --> 55:36.291
- [Verna] Can't let you out that easy.
- [groans]

55:38.625 --> 55:41.458
Hello again, handsome.
