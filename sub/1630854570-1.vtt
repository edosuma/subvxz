WEBVTT

03:54.318 --> 03:55.360
Thank you.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.156
Thank you for coming.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.367
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.037
And I'm not talkin'
about a new pair of trousers.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.998
An old pair, just lyin' there.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.833
Yeah. See, I used to do that.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.960
When my mum wouldn't let me wear
my miniskirt out of the house.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.795
I just got changed in the back row.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.130
Also, used nappy.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.423
Popcorn bucket with vomit inside.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.386
Yeah. Whole cooked chicken in a Safeway bag.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.387
How about you, Hils?

04:22.554 --> 04:25.265
What's the worst thing you've found?
Anything interesting?

04:25.891 --> 04:26.850
Dead body.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.604
Had a heart attack
during <i>Smokey and the Bandit.</i>

04:30.771 --> 04:32.648
Took three people to move him.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.067
Bloody hell.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.819
Well, that's killed the mood.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.199
What the fuck?

04:42.366 --> 04:43.283
Blimey!

06:27.387 --> 06:29.556
Headaches? Nausea?

06:30.390 --> 06:31.642
No.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.477
Sleeping all right?

06:33.644 --> 06:34.520
Yes.

06:34.686 --> 06:35.687
Good.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.106
Shall we weigh you?

06:42.569 --> 06:44.363
Not ideal.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.989
Four pounds heavier.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.620
How do you feel, generally?

06:51.828 --> 06:52.913
Fine.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.541
Do you feel better since leaving St. Jude's?

06:55.707 --> 06:56.792
Yes.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.461
Any big mood swings?

06:59.962 --> 07:01.129
No, not really.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.465
Good.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.176
Stable.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.136
That's good.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.980
I do feel a bit...

07:22.025 --> 07:23.485
Numb, I suppose.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.323
Well, I'm sure that'll wear off
as soon as you get used to the lithium.

07:28.490 --> 07:29.992
It's marvelous stuff.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.789
And you do have people you could talk to,
I assume?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.292
Family, friends?

07:39.209 --> 07:40.502
Oh, yes.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.560
Hilary, do you have a partner?

07:56.727 --> 07:57.936
Yes. No, I don't think so.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.146
Excellent. This is Bill.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.480
Bill, this is Hilary.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.732
-How do you do?
-Nice to meet you.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.442
Apologies in advance.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.375
I mean, it's so depressing.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.211
He's just dronin' on and on.

08:22.753 --> 08:23.712
You wake me up when it's over.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.088
Piss off!

08:26.548 --> 08:27.466
No, don't!

08:27.549 --> 08:29.218
You're gonna break it.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.011
-No, don't! You're gonna break it.
-Janine! Stop the...

08:33.304 --> 08:34.222
God, you're a tosser.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.974
I am a tosser, but I did try.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.392
Yeah. Yeah, whatever.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.602
Listen, come back, Supertramp,
all is forgiven!

08:48.946 --> 08:50.280
What on earth is going on?

08:50.447 --> 08:53.033
Sorry, Mr. Ellis, Janine was playing us
something on her Walkman.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.326
Well, you can all calm down.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.286
Janine, if you're at a loose end...

08:56.453 --> 08:58.080
perhaps you'd like to come
and do tickets for us?

08:58.497 --> 09:00.332
Trevor hasn't shown up again, so we're short.

09:00.499 --> 09:01.667
But it's my lunch break.

09:01.834 --> 09:03.210
It doesn't look like you were eating
much lunch.

09:03.377 --> 09:04.837
Well, yeah, 'cause I haven't had
the chance yet.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.297
My heart bleeds. Outside.

09:12.469 --> 09:16.139
Hilary, perhaps you and I could discuss
that whole Trevor situation in my office?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.349
Ten minutes.

09:17.516 --> 09:18.600
Yes, of course.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.154
-Suck me.
-No.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.490
Please. Suck me off.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.659
No, let's just keep...

09:37.369 --> 09:38.662
Just like this.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.998
Like this.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.005
Good evening, sir. How can I help you?

10:30.172 --> 10:31.548
Table for two, please.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.012
Can I take your coat?

10:37.179 --> 10:38.347
Thank you.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.529
May I take your order, madam?

10:54.238 --> 10:55.447
I'm not sure...

10:57.199 --> 11:00.118
You know, I've just realized,
I'm really late for an appointment.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.286
I'm terribly sorry.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.774
So, Stephen here will be replacing Trevor,
who was never here anyway.

11:30.941 --> 11:32.776
So, he's already off to a flying start.

11:33.986 --> 11:37.114
Anyway, this is Neil,
who does Box Office mostly.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.740
-Nice to meet you.
-Hiya.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.325
Norman, our projectionist.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.827
-All right?
-Hello.

11:41.994 --> 11:44.204
And Janine, who'll be collecting tickets
with you.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.290
Watch out for her strange musical tastes.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.541
It can't be worse than mine.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.042
-Hiya.
-Hi.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.377
Frankie, Brian...

11:50.544 --> 11:51.879
and Finn with the...

11:52.045 --> 11:52.880
hair.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.506
-Hello.
-Hey.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.676
And our esteemed duty manager, Hilary.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.928
She also does sweets and snacks.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.097
-Hello.
-Hello.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.517
So, I'll leave you all
to get better acquainted.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.227
Hilary will show you the ropes.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.649
Make sure you take the packet
from the front...

12:12.816 --> 12:14.651
otherwise it never gets sold
then it gets dusty.

12:14.818 --> 12:15.903
Okay.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.531
That smell must make you hungry.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.408
You're never tempted to sneak a handful?

12:21.575 --> 12:22.576
No.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.952
I didn't mean to steal it, I just meant...

12:24.119 --> 12:25.662
Try to keep a tab of the items you sell...

12:25.829 --> 12:27.956
and then make sure you replace them
at the end of your shift.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.467
This is Screen One.

12:40.177 --> 12:41.220
Wicked.

12:43.764 --> 12:46.850
You'll have to do final cleanup
if you're on late shift.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.019
Make sure to check for sleepers.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.812
-Really?
-Yes.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.815
One chap used to bring in an air mattress.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.529
Projection booth.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.614
Don't go in. Norman's very particular.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.161
You stand at the bottom of these stairs.

13:06.328 --> 13:07.955
And, make sure you keep hold
of the ticket stubs...

13:08.121 --> 13:10.666
then bring them back to me
so I can check them against admissions.

13:10.832 --> 13:14.169
Okay. So, when do we, you know, open up?

13:15.879 --> 13:16.880
Twenty minutes.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.298
What's up there?

13:18.465 --> 13:19.633
Public aren't allowed.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.093
Can I have a look?

13:21.718 --> 13:23.178
-I'm not sure.
-Go on.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.513
Please.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.071
Oh, my God.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.447
It's a whole other cinema.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.491
Used to be four screens.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.049
Screen Three.

14:04.136 --> 14:05.345
Screen Four.

14:28.619 --> 14:30.162
Best for last.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.463
Wow.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.323
What a place.

15:07.157 --> 15:08.867
It really was beautiful.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.577
It still is.

15:16.375 --> 15:17.668
Another world.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.634
Look at this little fellow.

15:38.272 --> 15:39.523
It's all right.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.486
It's all right. It's all right.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.412
I think he's broken his wing.

15:56.415 --> 15:57.916
He needs a bit of help.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.129
I don't think he likes it.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.964
It's okay, he's fine.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.135
Aren't you?

16:09.720 --> 16:10.846
Here, hold him.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.514
Oh, no, no. I don't like birds.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.099
Oh, come on. Look.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.392
Come on.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.103
Go like this.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.399
There you go.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.610
He loves it.

16:26.111 --> 16:27.613
Look, he prefers you.

16:30.532 --> 16:31.700
Now...

16:43.879 --> 16:44.922
What're you doing?

16:45.088 --> 16:46.423
Special trick.

16:49.051 --> 16:49.968
You okay?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.136
Yeah.

17:00.604 --> 17:01.939
You ready?

17:05.067 --> 17:06.484
Hold him still.

17:09.530 --> 17:10.446
Yes.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.411
Good boy.

17:17.496 --> 17:18.829
You can put him down now.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.344
What happens when he needs the loo?

17:43.272 --> 17:44.690
Nine across.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.192
Five letters.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.863
Word that starts a Waste Land.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.782
April.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.373
-Morning, Hils.
-Morning.

18:01.540 --> 18:02.541
Norman.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.293
Got your glad rags for tonight?

18:04.459 --> 18:06.044
Yes. And I brought those in for later.

18:06.503 --> 18:07.462
Ooh, I say!

18:07.629 --> 18:10.924
So, we could go down Misty's off Tivoli Road,
if we can get in.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.301
-Or that club, Hades, at the Lido...
-Hello.

18:12.384 --> 18:13.427
...has got a good DJ.

18:13.594 --> 18:14.845
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

18:15.012 --> 18:15.888
What's all that?

18:16.054 --> 18:17.181
It's my stingy brim.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.724
My three-button tonic for tonight.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.392
Didn't have you down as a Rude Boy.

18:20.559 --> 18:21.560
What you goin' on about?

18:21.727 --> 18:23.687
Rude boy, you know? Two Tone.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.147
-Who-tone?
-Two Tone.

18:25.314 --> 18:27.316
The Specials, The Selecter, The Beat.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.110
I don't understand a single word
you're sayin'.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.029
It is a bit like reggae, but dance music.

18:32.196 --> 18:33.655
It's like fast reggae.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.865
Always fancied one of these.

18:35.032 --> 18:38.035
Yeah, you've got the reggae ska side,
and then you've got the punk side.

18:38.202 --> 18:40.412
You know, Black and white together.
It's a melting pot.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.378
God help us.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.088
What about you, Hilary?

18:50.255 --> 18:51.381
Gonna come dance with us?

18:51.548 --> 18:53.634
Oh, no, I shouldn't think so.
It's not really my thing.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.844
Discotheques. Bloody nightmare.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.304
So, what're you gonna do?

18:58.680 --> 19:01.099
I dunno, I thought I might go onto the roof,
watch the fireworks.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.643
Nice.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.729
Where's all your mates, anyway?

19:05.896 --> 19:06.897
Buggered off to college.

19:07.064 --> 19:07.898
Ah, that's where I'm goin'.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.441
Good luck with that.

19:10.234 --> 19:11.610
Well, off we go, then.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.029
Another day, another four pounds fifty.

19:16.657 --> 19:17.533
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.369
He is such a much of a hunk.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.459
Now that is on the cards.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.702
Screen One, top of the stairs. Enjoy.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.499
Upstairs, Screen One. Okay?

20:09.793 --> 20:11.795
Thank you. Enjoy the film.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.630
I'm looking forward to it.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.063
Yes, sir.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.666
That's the 8 o'clock up and runnin'.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.669
So, what time are you clocking off?

20:52.836 --> 20:54.254
Where are the ticket stubs?

20:54.421 --> 20:55.380
I gave 'em to Janine.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.216
Where's Janine?

20:58.258 --> 21:00.260
Shit. I think she went early.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.763
You had one thing I asked you to do.
One thing.

21:02.930 --> 21:06.058
-Yeah, I know, but I thought that I could...
-It's completely unacceptable!

21:07.267 --> 21:10.103
-All right, there's no need to...
-It's unprofessional!

21:10.270 --> 21:12.272
Impersonating the customers...

21:12.439 --> 21:14.149
laughing behind their backs!

21:14.483 --> 21:17.110
People come here for a nice time,
not to be laughed at!

21:21.281 --> 21:22.491
Yeah, you're right.

21:23.617 --> 21:24.451
I'm sorry.

21:26.328 --> 21:27.955
Good.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.915
Just don't laugh at people.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.646
Hilary, when you're done later...

21:52.813 --> 21:54.398
why don't you pop into the office
for a quick drink?

21:54.606 --> 21:56.358
-Oh, I don't know.
-No, come on.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.736
Just for a few minutes. Toast the new year.

22:00.946 --> 22:02.656
All right. That would be nice.

22:12.082 --> 22:14.501
No invite for me, I see.

22:20.299 --> 22:21.842
I can't.

22:30.559 --> 22:31.476
Stop.

22:32.936 --> 22:33.979
Why?

22:34.521 --> 22:35.397
Who's this hurting?

22:35.564 --> 22:36.607
Well, your wife, for one.

22:36.773 --> 22:37.858
She has no idea.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.359
Doesn't mean it's right.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.819
Brenda doesn't know me anymore.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.531
We've been sleeping in different rooms
since the summer.

22:47.576 --> 22:50.287
She won't even make me a cup of tea.

22:55.959 --> 22:57.419
You're the most wonderful person.

22:59.338 --> 23:00.923
You're so helpful.

23:03.467 --> 23:04.885
I feel such...

23:05.052 --> 23:06.845
tenderness towards you.

23:08.597 --> 23:11.058
Your arse feels so good in my hands.

23:29.493 --> 23:30.953
Here's to 1981.

23:35.749 --> 23:37.501
God, lovely stuff, that.

23:38.752 --> 23:39.586
Glenfiddich.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.343
So, any New Year's resolutions?

23:48.387 --> 23:49.513
No, not really.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.306
Try to eat a bit better, maybe.

23:52.850 --> 23:55.769
-I was thinking perhaps I'd...
-I'd like to expand this place a bit.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.479
Put it on the map.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.732
Can I let you in on a secret?

24:01.191 --> 24:03.110
-You mustn't tell anyone.
-What?

24:03.277 --> 24:05.696
It looks like we might be getting
a big South Coast premiere.

24:06.405 --> 24:07.948
Mayor, councilors...

24:08.115 --> 24:09.867
<i>Herald,</i> the lot.

24:10.993 --> 24:11.910
Gosh.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.538
-Well, that would be wonderful.
-I know.

24:14.705 --> 24:17.332
<i>Chariots of Fire.</i> That's the film.

24:17.499 --> 24:19.960
It was between us and the Odeon,
but they didn't want a circuit cinema.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.336
So, it looks like we've got the nod.

24:21.503 --> 24:24.631
So, we'll have to spruce the place up a bit.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.926
Who knows?

24:28.677 --> 24:31.346
Might be the beginning
of an exciting new chapter.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.002
Jesus!

25:02.169 --> 25:03.170
Hello?

25:03.337 --> 25:04.630
It's me, Stephen.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.517
Come in.

25:16.683 --> 25:17.518
I was just leaving.

25:18.894 --> 25:21.939
I wanted to apologize for earlier.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.901
Really, it's fine. I'm sorry I shouted.

25:27.069 --> 25:28.946
Why didn't you go with Janine?

25:29.446 --> 25:31.657
I did, for a bit.

25:31.823 --> 25:35.410
But I don't know any of her mates,
and people, you know, staring. So...

25:37.329 --> 25:39.289
How awful to feel watched.

25:39.456 --> 25:41.250
Yeah, sometimes.

25:42.334 --> 25:45.629
Anyway, I thought you might want company.

25:45.796 --> 25:46.713
On the roof.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.842
Oh, I'd almost forgotten about that.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.929
Yeah, okay. Why not?

26:02.062 --> 26:04.189
Wow. This is so cool.

26:07.651 --> 26:08.527
Look at that.

26:08.694 --> 26:11.071
If I had some binoculars
I could almost see my mum.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.656
Is that where you live?

26:13.991 --> 26:15.033
Yeah.

26:18.245 --> 26:19.788
Do you always come up here on New Year's Eve?

26:19.955 --> 26:21.206
Last couple of years.

26:21.373 --> 26:23.083
I don't blame you.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.754
Here. Not exactly Moët,
but it's better than Tizer.

26:27.921 --> 26:28.755
Thank you.

26:28.922 --> 26:30.549
I'm sorry it's just us.

26:30.716 --> 26:32.134
No, this is nice.

26:32.301 --> 26:34.219
I'm not really a fan of New Year's Eve,
anyway.

26:36.305 --> 26:37.973
Last year, I puked on my new shoes.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.600
Oh, no! What happened to them?

26:41.018 --> 26:42.144
They survived.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.814
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.319
Come on! Get it down ya!

26:50.485 --> 26:52.112
Oh, no. I shouldn't.
I've had too much already.

26:52.279 --> 26:53.822
Really? When?

26:55.949 --> 26:57.242
Come on.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.536
What are you, a woman or a wouse?

26:59.703 --> 27:00.495
What's that?

27:00.662 --> 27:02.289
<i>9 to 5.</i>

27:03.207 --> 27:04.750
You know, <i>9 to 5,</i> the film we're showing.

27:06.627 --> 27:09.171
Honestly, anyone would think you worked
in a bank, Hilary.

27:09.338 --> 27:10.297
Why don't you sneak in and watch?

27:10.672 --> 27:12.508
Oh, no, no, that's for the customers.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.927
And it gets so busy out front,
there's always so much to do.

27:16.637 --> 27:18.514
Oh, God, listen to me, I'm so boring.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.765
Honestly.

27:22.726 --> 27:23.560
Oh, listen.

27:39.326 --> 27:42.120
"Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky...

27:42.663 --> 27:45.666
"the flying cloud and the frosty light.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.044
"The year is dying in the night.

27:50.254 --> 27:53.257
"Ring out, wild bells, and let him die."

27:57.386 --> 27:58.262
Nice.

27:59.429 --> 28:00.305
Tennyson.

28:00.472 --> 28:02.182
Ten, nine.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.392
Eight.

28:03.559 --> 28:05.769
Seven, six...

28:06.186 --> 28:08.480
five, four...

28:08.647 --> 28:11.441
three, two, one!

28:11.608 --> 28:13.485
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

28:53.901 --> 28:54.735
Shit.

28:59.198 --> 29:00.490
Hilary, it's all right!

30:09.726 --> 30:10.894
Why not?

30:11.895 --> 30:13.355
Because it's pointless.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.232
They turned me down the first time.

30:15.399 --> 30:16.441
To study what?

30:16.608 --> 30:17.860
Architecture.

30:18.026 --> 30:20.404
Oh, that would be wonderful!

30:20.571 --> 30:22.114
Yeah.

30:22.281 --> 30:24.408
You have to try again.

30:24.575 --> 30:25.868
Yeah, maybe.

30:26.994 --> 30:28.328
Well, you can't just give up.

30:29.997 --> 30:31.248
Stephen?

30:32.833 --> 30:34.918
Don't let them tell you
what you can or can't do.

30:35.794 --> 30:37.671
No one's gonna give you the life you want.

30:38.755 --> 30:40.299
You have to go out and get it.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.470
You can't stay here.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.308
All right.

31:47.991 --> 31:48.825
Oi!

31:50.911 --> 31:53.038
Oi! Where you from?

31:53.205 --> 31:53.956
Where you goin', son?

31:54.122 --> 31:56.166
Well, they have fuckin' bananas
where you come from, did they?

31:57.084 --> 31:59.211
Why don't you fuck off back home
where you came from, yeah?

31:59.378 --> 32:00.295
You fuckin' chimp.

32:00.462 --> 32:02.089
Yeah, go home, fuckin' coon.

32:02.256 --> 32:04.132
We don't like wogs 'round here.

32:04.299 --> 32:05.801
Taking our jobs.

32:05.968 --> 32:07.344
Go, then. Fuck off!

32:15.269 --> 32:16.770
Go home, fucking coon.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.318
I told management months ago.

32:23.485 --> 32:26.780
There should be a no-smoking rule
in both auditoria.

32:26.947 --> 32:29.157
Smoke compromises the viewing experience.

32:29.324 --> 32:32.703
Ruins the projected image,
and it stains the screen.

32:33.537 --> 32:34.997
Simple common sense.

32:35.998 --> 32:37.332
All I'm saying is...

32:37.499 --> 32:40.669
you need a basic understanding
of optical and mechanical principles...

32:40.836 --> 32:42.171
to be in this game.

32:42.337 --> 32:45.424
Like I keep telling Ellis,
any old numpty could sell tickets.

32:45.591 --> 32:46.425
Morning.

32:47.426 --> 32:48.260
Morning, Mr. Ellis.

32:48.427 --> 32:49.636
Morning, Norman.
Morning, all.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.805
-Hilary, can you pop in for a minute?
-Nope.

32:55.851 --> 32:57.603
-I'm sorry?
-No, I can't.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.313
I'm running late. I need to open up.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.527
Suit yourself.

33:08.530 --> 33:10.157
I was going to ask you to work late tonight.

33:10.657 --> 33:12.034
Brenda and I have an engagement.

33:12.201 --> 33:14.036
So, I'll need to be gone by 5:00.

33:14.203 --> 33:15.078
Sorry.

33:32.054 --> 33:35.224
Screen Two.
Go on upstairs. Enjoy the film.

33:48.820 --> 33:49.821
Hello.

33:50.614 --> 33:53.784
I think our little friend might need a visit.

33:54.368 --> 33:55.661
It'll cheer him up.

33:59.206 --> 34:00.457
Nearly ready.

34:01.333 --> 34:02.668
Open the window.

34:15.514 --> 34:18.600
Look at that.

34:20.853 --> 34:21.812
Good as new.

34:21.978 --> 34:23.021
Amazing.

34:24.690 --> 34:25.899
Yeah.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.735
Time to say goodbye.

34:29.902 --> 34:30.987
Bye.

34:38.286 --> 34:39.830
There he goes.

34:41.998 --> 34:43.292
To be able to fly.

34:45.418 --> 34:46.587
Yeah.

36:05.999 --> 36:08.335
Trinidad, originally.

36:08.502 --> 36:11.421
They brought my mum over in the '60s
to train as a nurse.

36:11.588 --> 36:13.257
Apparently, they needed more workers.

36:14.341 --> 36:17.261
"Help rebuild the mother country,
make your fortune."

36:20.264 --> 36:22.891
She's still here, still a nurse.

36:23.058 --> 36:24.685
That explains the pigeon splint.

36:26.228 --> 36:27.187
You got me.

36:27.354 --> 36:29.147
And here was me thinking you were Jesus.

36:32.192 --> 36:33.402
What about your dad?

36:35.612 --> 36:37.114
He was a bus driver.

36:37.281 --> 36:38.448
But he left years ago.

36:39.116 --> 36:39.867
Where to?

36:40.033 --> 36:41.118
I dunno.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.037
Gosh. How did you feel?

36:45.956 --> 36:47.499
Fine.

36:50.961 --> 36:53.297
It's always been just me and my mum.

36:53.463 --> 36:55.048
She's the best.

36:56.466 --> 36:58.177
Wish I could say the same for mine.

37:04.850 --> 37:07.352
Was that... you know?

37:08.103 --> 37:09.396
Was it okay?

37:11.315 --> 37:12.733
Yeah.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.651
It was more than okay.

37:20.282 --> 37:21.742
Shit.

37:22.326 --> 37:23.452
What time is it?

37:24.077 --> 37:25.370
Where have you been?

37:25.537 --> 37:27.414
Ellis left 20 minutes ago,
he said you were covering.

37:27.581 --> 37:28.957
I'm so sorry, Neil.

37:29.124 --> 37:31.001
I've had to keep them all waiting outside!

37:31.168 --> 37:32.252
And where's Stephen?

37:32.419 --> 37:34.171
I don't know. Is he not here?

37:35.422 --> 37:36.340
Sorry!

37:43.764 --> 37:46.558
So sorry! Thank you very much.

37:46.725 --> 37:49.436
Sorry to keep you. Thank you.

37:49.603 --> 37:50.562
Thank you very much.

37:51.939 --> 37:54.149
Thank you so much.

37:54.316 --> 37:56.693
Hello, there. Sorry to keep you.

39:14.438 --> 39:15.522
Enjoy the film.

39:19.234 --> 39:19.902
I'm so sorry, sir.

39:20.068 --> 39:22.237
You have to finish those out here,
you can't bring them in.

39:23.071 --> 39:24.114
Why not?

39:24.656 --> 39:26.283
Because those are the rules.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.327
It's my breakfast.

39:28.493 --> 39:30.871
I know, but you've got a couple of minutes
before the film starts.

39:31.371 --> 39:32.998
I'll miss the comin' attractions.

39:33.790 --> 39:34.625
Well, it's up to you.

39:36.835 --> 39:38.253
Are you fuckin' serious?

39:41.256 --> 39:42.257
Yes.

39:49.348 --> 39:52.100
Are you gonna stand there
and let me be bossed around by this...?

39:52.976 --> 39:54.102
By this...

39:55.103 --> 39:56.063
what?

39:58.565 --> 39:59.399
By this what?

39:59.566 --> 40:00.567
Okay, now, Mr. Cooper.

40:00.734 --> 40:02.569
You haven't got many chips left, look.

40:02.736 --> 40:04.530
You could eat a few
and then give the rest to me.

40:06.949 --> 40:07.950
I like a chip.

41:12.139 --> 41:13.724
Happy now?

41:21.940 --> 41:22.858
So sorry.

41:24.526 --> 41:26.403
Sorry, Stephen,
he's always a bit of a handful.

41:26.570 --> 41:27.821
He's a dickhead.

41:33.035 --> 41:33.869
You okay?

41:36.121 --> 41:38.040
Stephen? Stephen?

41:40.042 --> 41:41.543
Stephen?

41:45.297 --> 41:48.008
It's no point walking out.

41:48.175 --> 41:49.676
There's every fuckin' point.

41:49.843 --> 41:50.677
He's just an angry man.

41:50.844 --> 41:52.387
He's always angry about something.

41:52.554 --> 41:55.641
Look, Hilary, I know you're trying to help,
but you're just makin' it worse.

41:55.807 --> 41:57.059
How am I making it worse?

41:57.226 --> 41:59.645
By pretending it isn't there.

41:59.811 --> 42:01.188
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

42:01.355 --> 42:02.898
All right, put it this way.

42:03.440 --> 42:05.776
He's not just "angry," is he?

42:08.278 --> 42:10.239
And he should be the one to leave.

42:10.405 --> 42:11.698
Not me.

42:19.081 --> 42:21.750
You're absolutely right, Stephen. I'm sorry.

42:21.917 --> 42:23.001
Really.

42:25.254 --> 42:28.757
Okay, this might be the moment
to demonstrate my greatest talent.

42:37.224 --> 42:38.308
Does it happen a lot?

42:39.184 --> 42:40.686
Yeah, more than it used to.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.397
Especially the last few months.

42:44.273 --> 42:45.607
Really?

42:45.774 --> 42:46.817
Well, yeah.

42:48.026 --> 42:49.361
It's everywhere, isn't it?

42:50.404 --> 42:51.238
Is it?

42:51.405 --> 42:52.823
Yes, it is.

42:54.408 --> 42:56.159
All that stuff in Brixton.

42:56.869 --> 42:58.537
And the skinheads.

42:58.704 --> 42:59.913
And Thatcher.

43:00.706 --> 43:02.666
And those kids in New Cross.

43:03.834 --> 43:04.668
What was New Cross?

43:07.421 --> 43:10.632
Couple of weeks ago,
at this girl's 16th birthday party...

43:10.799 --> 43:12.217
someone started a fire.

43:13.552 --> 43:14.887
No one came for them.

43:16.305 --> 43:18.432
You should read the newspapers, Hilary.

43:20.100 --> 43:21.685
It's not goin' away.

43:29.109 --> 43:30.277
Told you, you need to hold it sideways.

43:36.575 --> 43:38.285
Yeah, not bad.

43:38.452 --> 43:41.121
Still some training needed.
Look, watch this. Okay?

43:45.751 --> 43:47.294
I lied. I'm shit at it.

43:49.671 --> 43:50.547
Kiss me.

43:53.008 --> 43:54.426
No one's looking.

44:23.539 --> 44:26.250
Four canisters at a time,
'cause they're not light.

44:27.167 --> 44:28.544
And lift 'em carefully.

44:29.503 --> 44:30.838
Precious cargo.

44:58.699 --> 44:59.950
Put 'em down there.

45:10.878 --> 45:13.088
-Tea?
-Please.

45:21.054 --> 45:22.931
You can go in if you want.

45:51.126 --> 45:52.586
These are my babies.

45:53.712 --> 45:55.422
Pair of model 18 Kalees.

45:56.381 --> 45:58.342
I had no idea they'd be so big.

45:58.509 --> 46:00.344
Well, that's just as it should be.

46:00.511 --> 46:02.971
You don't want people to know.

46:03.138 --> 46:05.516
They should just see a beam of light.

46:05.682 --> 46:06.975
But back here...

46:08.393 --> 46:09.478
it's belts, straps,

46:09.645 --> 46:11.522
pulleys, intermittents...

46:11.688 --> 46:13.357
sprockets.

46:13.524 --> 46:15.442
Complex machinery.

46:18.195 --> 46:19.112
And what's this?

46:24.409 --> 46:25.661
That's the carbons.

46:27.329 --> 46:30.332
Spark between the carbons makes the light.

46:30.499 --> 46:32.376
And nothing happens without light.

46:33.126 --> 46:33.961
Ciggy?

46:35.045 --> 46:36.421
No, thanks.

46:46.056 --> 46:47.432
Amazin'.

46:48.308 --> 46:49.768
It is amazing.

46:50.811 --> 46:55.148
Because it's just static frames,
with darkness in between.

46:58.235 --> 47:01.154
But there's a little flaw
in your optic nerve...

47:01.321 --> 47:05.284
so that if I run the film
at 24 frames per second...

47:07.035 --> 47:08.996
you don't see the darkness.

47:12.124 --> 47:13.333
Wow.

47:17.588 --> 47:19.464
It's called the Phi Phenomenon.

47:19.965 --> 47:23.177
Viewing static images rapidly
in succession...

47:24.178 --> 47:25.846
creates an illusion of motion.

47:29.558 --> 47:31.101
Illusion of life.

47:36.356 --> 47:39.693
So, on top of the lobby needing
a lick of paint and all the rest...

47:39.860 --> 47:41.612
we're going to need special signage...

47:41.778 --> 47:43.363
a red carpet...

47:43.530 --> 47:44.948
crash barriers for the crowds.

47:45.115 --> 47:49.536
And I believe the mayor's office
will provide some security. Jim?

47:49.703 --> 47:52.998
Yes, yes, indeed.
There will be a small security detail.

47:53.165 --> 47:55.417
And you can expect the mayor, of course...

47:55.584 --> 47:58.795
and his entourage,
which is not insubstantial.

47:58.962 --> 48:00.297
And we're waiting for confirmation...

48:00.464 --> 48:04.134
but guests look to include Dora Bryan...

48:05.135 --> 48:06.678
Sir Laurence Olivier...

48:07.554 --> 48:08.388
Steve Ovett...

48:09.348 --> 48:11.391
Dame Flora Robson...

48:11.558 --> 48:13.769
Dusty Springfield...

48:13.936 --> 48:16.480
and possibly, Paul McCartney.

48:16.647 --> 48:18.690
-Goodness.
-Yes, I know.

48:18.857 --> 48:20.567
-Lives in Rye.
-Hmm.

48:22.361 --> 48:24.780
Two pounds down since last time. Well done.

48:24.947 --> 48:27.324
Well, I've been trying
to take a bit more exercise...

48:27.491 --> 48:28.659
eating better, you know.

48:28.825 --> 48:30.744
And the lithium? How's that?

48:30.911 --> 48:31.703
Good.

48:31.870 --> 48:34.331
Last time you said that it made you feel
a little out of sorts.

48:34.498 --> 48:35.374
Yes, it's much better now.

48:35.541 --> 48:37.417
I think my system must be getting used to it.

48:37.793 --> 48:38.627
Really?

48:39.002 --> 48:40.754
Yeah, much better.

48:41.797 --> 48:43.090
Excellent.

50:19.561 --> 50:21.480
What're you doing? No one's watchin' you!

50:21.647 --> 50:22.856
Shut up, look the other way.

50:23.023 --> 50:24.107
Why? I've seen it all.

50:24.274 --> 50:25.400
Don't be vulgar.

50:25.567 --> 50:26.818
It's different in the throes of passion.

50:26.985 --> 50:28.570
Well, I can't be bothered.

50:28.862 --> 50:30.489
I am going...

50:30.656 --> 50:31.490
What're you doing?

50:34.701 --> 50:35.536
No!

50:35.702 --> 50:36.662
Charge!

51:07.359 --> 51:08.652
Where did you meet her?

51:08.819 --> 51:12.072
She was one of the nurses on my mum's ward.

51:13.699 --> 51:15.534
She your first serious girlfriend?

51:16.618 --> 51:17.619
Yeah.

51:18.161 --> 51:20.539
Broke my heart. Cried for a week.

51:21.874 --> 51:24.793
I still can't go near the hospital
without getting butterflies.

51:26.879 --> 51:27.963
Goodness.

51:29.423 --> 51:31.925
Yeah, I just couldn't stop thinkin'
about her, you know?

51:35.804 --> 51:36.930
What about you?

51:37.097 --> 51:38.473
Oh, nothing as grand as that.

51:39.224 --> 51:40.517
There must have been someone.

51:43.979 --> 51:44.813
Hilary?

51:44.980 --> 51:46.315
Mind your own business.

51:48.358 --> 51:49.318
Okay.

51:53.030 --> 51:54.448
That one's different to the others.

51:54.865 --> 51:56.450
I wasn't aware I was working
under instruction.

51:56.825 --> 51:58.243
I'm just saying.

51:58.410 --> 52:00.120
Well, thank you. Thank you so much.

52:05.459 --> 52:06.710
Why you doing that? You're spoilin' it.

52:06.877 --> 52:08.670
I am not working under instruction.

52:08.837 --> 52:09.755
All right, fine.

52:10.088 --> 52:10.923
Do what you want.

52:11.089 --> 52:12.466
I shall. Thank you.

52:14.927 --> 52:15.969
God, you men, you always have to help us.

52:16.136 --> 52:17.554
Always have to instruct us.

52:17.721 --> 52:18.639
Don't be silly.

52:18.805 --> 52:21.350
Got your hands around our fucking throats
and you won't let go.

52:22.726 --> 52:25.938
Got your hands around our fucking necks
and we can't breathe.

52:26.104 --> 52:28.815
But you won't let go, will you?
You won't fucking well let go!

52:29.233 --> 52:30.859
-Why don't you just...
-Hilary!

52:31.026 --> 52:32.069
-...fucking let go?
-Stop.

52:32.236 --> 52:33.362
What're you doin'?

52:34.988 --> 52:37.032
You won't fucking well let go, will you?

53:40.470 --> 53:41.763
Are you sure you'll be okay getting home?

53:42.973 --> 53:44.016
Yeah.

53:44.558 --> 53:45.934
-You?
-Oh, I'll be fine.

53:46.518 --> 53:48.395
I'm in early tomorrow to open up.

53:48.562 --> 53:49.438
Maybe see you then?

54:54.294 --> 54:55.128
Morning.

54:55.295 --> 54:56.338
Morning.

55:07.432 --> 55:08.475
Listen...

55:09.768 --> 55:12.271
Hilary, I know it's none of my business...

55:12.437 --> 55:16.441
but perhaps it might be better
to leave your personal life at home.

55:18.151 --> 55:19.027
What?

55:20.070 --> 55:22.823
Rather than upstairs, in the...

55:23.824 --> 55:24.950
you know...

55:25.284 --> 55:26.785
in the pigeon coop.

55:29.204 --> 55:30.747
I don't know what you mean.

55:30.914 --> 55:32.207
Oh, come on.

55:34.793 --> 55:36.128
Look, be careful.

55:37.629 --> 55:40.048
Hils, remember what happened before.

55:44.803 --> 55:46.346
Just look after yourself.

55:58.233 --> 55:59.985
I don't know how he knew, he just knew.

56:01.111 --> 56:04.281
I think he might have seen us
coming downstairs together the other day.

56:04.448 --> 56:05.782
It's fine. We just need to be more discreet.

56:05.949 --> 56:07.743
Perhaps just meet outside of work?

56:09.328 --> 56:10.704
Look...

56:12.164 --> 56:13.582
maybe it's not a good idea.

56:14.875 --> 56:15.709
What do you mean?

56:15.876 --> 56:17.211
Well, this.

56:17.377 --> 56:18.253
The whole thing.

56:19.087 --> 56:19.922
Why?

56:20.088 --> 56:22.966
Well, once people know it, it's different.

56:23.133 --> 56:23.967
Really?

56:24.134 --> 56:25.385
Yeah, it's just...

56:26.261 --> 56:27.179
It feels different.

56:28.764 --> 56:29.598
You're embarrassed.

56:29.765 --> 56:31.308
No, I'm not. And that's not what I'm saying.

56:31.475 --> 56:32.309
-Yes, you are, you're embarrassed.
-I just don't...

56:32.476 --> 56:33.602
Of course you are. It's silly.

56:33.769 --> 56:34.811
It's ridiculous. What were we thinking?

56:34.978 --> 56:36.438
I'm not embarrassed, Hilary.

56:36.605 --> 56:38.899
-I just don't think we can do this.
-No, you're absolutely right.

56:39.900 --> 56:40.984
I'll see you soon.

57:31.660 --> 57:34.079
Have either of you two seen the keys
to the utility cupboard?

57:34.246 --> 57:35.372
Oh, I dunno.

57:35.539 --> 57:36.874
I think Hilary had them.

57:56.602 --> 57:58.187
-There you go.
-Thanks.

58:04.401 --> 58:05.360
You heard from Hilary?

58:06.195 --> 58:07.279
No.

58:07.738 --> 58:09.031
It's been three days.

58:10.782 --> 58:13.493
She told Mr. Ellis she was taking
some overdue holiday.

58:13.660 --> 58:14.661
I'm sure it's all fine.

58:17.039 --> 58:18.749
So why am I worried?

58:22.920 --> 58:24.713
She had a rough time last year.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.882
She had to go away for a while in the summer.

58:28.175 --> 58:29.218
Why?

58:31.678 --> 58:34.014
I think things just got a bit much for her.

58:35.265 --> 58:38.185
She ended up being rude to a couple
of the customers.

58:38.352 --> 58:39.937
Shouting at them.

58:41.230 --> 58:43.899
She was staying later and later at work.

58:44.900 --> 58:46.276
Said she couldn't sleep.

58:47.653 --> 58:49.780
And started doing weird...

58:49.947 --> 58:50.989
things.

58:53.867 --> 58:57.579
Eventually, Ellis told us she had to go
into hospital.

58:58.789 --> 59:00.707
She was away for a few weeks...

59:00.874 --> 59:03.168
and when she got back she was different.

59:04.002 --> 59:05.045
How?

59:05.838 --> 59:07.214
Just quieter.

59:08.590 --> 59:10.175
A bit sad.

59:13.345 --> 59:15.264
Did you speak to her about it?

59:16.640 --> 59:18.225
She didn't wanna talk.

1:01:12.214 --> 1:01:13.298
Enjoy.

1:01:13.465 --> 1:01:14.383
Hi!

1:01:17.052 --> 1:01:17.719
Enjoy.

1:01:23.767 --> 1:01:25.352
My dear young man!

1:01:26.144 --> 1:01:27.855
Don't you look absolutely glorious!

1:01:28.021 --> 1:01:29.940
Hilary! Hi.

1:01:30.107 --> 1:01:31.066
Yes, I know, I don't have a ticket.

1:01:31.233 --> 1:01:32.526
But it's all right, I work here.

1:01:32.693 --> 1:01:34.278
I taught him everything he knows.

1:01:37.614 --> 1:01:38.657
Hello!

1:01:39.700 --> 1:01:40.909
Darling!

1:02:04.016 --> 1:02:07.686
My worshipful Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress...

1:02:07.853 --> 1:02:10.564
Councilor Rushworth, Councilor Booth.

1:02:10.731 --> 1:02:14.234
My lords, ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

1:02:14.776 --> 1:02:16.153
My name is Donald Ellis.

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:18.447
I am the manager of the Empire Cinema...

1:02:18.614 --> 1:02:21.575
perhaps the South Coast's
premier film venue.

1:02:23.952 --> 1:02:25.370
It is a great honor...

1:02:25.537 --> 1:02:27.998
perhaps the greatest of my career...

1:02:28.165 --> 1:02:30.375
to welcome you to this...

1:02:30.542 --> 1:02:34.546
the regional gala premiere
of <i>Chariots of Fire.</i>

1:02:40.302 --> 1:02:43.013
There are a few people I need to thank.

1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:45.015
-The mayor's office, obviously.
-Where's the mayor?

1:02:45.182 --> 1:02:47.851
-And in particular, Jim Booth for his help...
-There. Next to Ellis' wife.

1:02:49.102 --> 1:02:51.104
...and his sage advice.

1:02:51.271 --> 1:02:53.398
And all the staff here.

1:02:53.565 --> 1:02:54.733
Hilary's here.

1:02:54.900 --> 1:02:57.069
At the Empire, for their hard work
and dedication.

1:02:57.236 --> 1:02:58.111
What? Where?

1:02:58.278 --> 1:03:00.489
-And lastly...
-Somewhere in the building.

1:03:00.656 --> 1:03:01.823
...my wife, Brenda...

1:03:01.990 --> 1:03:03.158
Is she all right?

1:03:03.325 --> 1:03:06.161
-...whose unstinted support and love...
-I'm not sure.

1:03:06.328 --> 1:03:07.579
...have been unwavering.

1:03:08.914 --> 1:03:10.874
And so, without further ado...

1:03:11.041 --> 1:03:13.794
I am delighted to welcome you...

1:03:15.671 --> 1:03:20.384
to Hugh Hudson's stirring
and altogether terrific...

1:03:20.551 --> 1:03:21.927
<i>Chariots of Fire.</i>

1:03:35.190 --> 1:03:36.775
What're you doing?

1:03:41.196 --> 1:03:42.155
Oh, no.

1:03:47.870 --> 1:03:50.706
Good evening, my lords, ladies and gentlemen.

1:03:52.541 --> 1:03:53.542
Mr. Mayor.

1:03:55.252 --> 1:03:58.297
My name is Hilary Small.
I am duty manager here at the Empire.

1:04:00.048 --> 1:04:03.719
And as such, I thought I'd add
a few words of welcome.

1:04:06.221 --> 1:04:08.182
Tonight is a special night.

1:04:09.141 --> 1:04:10.350
More than ever...

1:04:12.394 --> 1:04:13.854
we need to be...

1:04:15.731 --> 1:04:18.650
We need to feel part of a community.

1:04:21.904 --> 1:04:23.530
Black or white, it doesn't matter.

1:04:25.699 --> 1:04:29.578
It's a very important thing.

1:04:33.749 --> 1:04:35.209
We must celebrate.

1:04:39.963 --> 1:04:41.381
So, to mark the occasion...

1:04:41.548 --> 1:04:44.343
I'd like to read a poem I think
would be appropriate.

1:04:44.510 --> 1:04:45.802
It's by W. H. Auden.

1:04:56.647 --> 1:05:00.651
"The desires of the heart
are as crooked as corkscrews.

1:05:01.693 --> 1:05:03.946
"Not to be born is the best for man...

1:05:04.112 --> 1:05:07.533
"the second best is a formal order...

1:05:07.699 --> 1:05:09.159
"the dance's pattern.

1:05:10.661 --> 1:05:12.579
"Dance while you can.

1:05:16.083 --> 1:05:19.461
"Dance, dance, for the figure is easy...

1:05:19.628 --> 1:05:22.673
"the tune is catching and will not stop.

1:05:24.591 --> 1:05:27.719
"Dance till the stars come down
from the rafters.

1:05:27.886 --> 1:05:31.223
"Dance, dance, dance till you drop."

1:05:33.809 --> 1:05:34.977
Thank you.

1:05:54.538 --> 1:05:55.706
Hilary!

1:05:55.873 --> 1:05:57.416
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1:05:57.583 --> 1:05:58.876
You were not invited to speak.

1:05:59.042 --> 1:06:01.795
Well, it can't be all men droning on.

1:06:01.962 --> 1:06:03.505
You knew what this evening meant to me,
Hilary.

1:06:03.672 --> 1:06:04.756
You more than anyone.

1:06:04.923 --> 1:06:06.216
And yet you willfully tried to ruin it.

1:06:06.383 --> 1:06:09.928
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
but you can't always have it your own way!

1:06:10.095 --> 1:06:11.847
Well, you've got a problem. You know that?

1:06:12.014 --> 1:06:13.140
You need serious help.

1:06:13.307 --> 1:06:16.101
Now, we've all tried to help you here,
but at some point you need...

1:06:16.268 --> 1:06:19.354
-...to take responsibility for your own...
-And why don't you go and fuck yourself!

1:06:22.482 --> 1:06:23.859
Donald?

1:06:24.276 --> 1:06:25.402
What're you doing? Why aren't you inside?

1:06:25.569 --> 1:06:26.695
The film's started.

1:06:26.862 --> 1:06:28.530
Oh, hello, Brenda.

1:06:28.697 --> 1:06:30.073
I've been wanting to meet.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.826
I think about you daily.

1:06:32.993 --> 1:06:34.203
I don't understand.

1:06:34.369 --> 1:06:35.704
Well, so many questions for a start.

1:06:35.871 --> 1:06:37.706
And so many notes to compare.

1:06:37.873 --> 1:06:40.000
I'm still unclear.

1:06:40.167 --> 1:06:42.711
Mostly about your husband's sexual tastes.

1:06:42.878 --> 1:06:44.129
Hilary, for God's sake.

1:06:45.005 --> 1:06:45.631
What do you mean?

1:06:45.797 --> 1:06:46.965
Brenda, this is nonsense.

1:06:47.132 --> 1:06:48.759
Don't listen to a word she says.

1:06:50.385 --> 1:06:54.139
"To fuck or not to fuck,
that is the question.

1:06:55.933 --> 1:06:59.186
"Whether 'tis nobler in the minds
to wank him off into his teacup...

1:06:59.353 --> 1:07:04.107
"or let him fuck me over his desk
and spoil all his paperwork?"

1:07:07.152 --> 1:07:08.320
Is this true?

1:07:12.491 --> 1:07:13.534
Donald, is this true?

1:07:13.700 --> 1:07:15.369
Yes.

1:07:17.454 --> 1:07:18.956
Yes, it's true.

1:07:23.418 --> 1:07:26.046
Well, first reel's goin' off beautifully.

1:07:27.589 --> 1:07:29.341
What the hell are you doing?

1:07:30.884 --> 1:07:32.427
Telling the truth.

1:07:33.303 --> 1:07:34.888
What a novel idea!

1:07:35.055 --> 1:07:36.557
That's not the truth.

1:07:38.559 --> 1:07:39.977
I'll tell you the truth.

1:07:41.186 --> 1:07:42.855
You're a schizophrenic.

1:07:43.021 --> 1:07:44.314
You're a fucking nutter!

1:07:45.649 --> 1:07:46.692
And the only reason you're working here...

1:07:46.859 --> 1:07:49.278
is because I told the social workers
I'd keep an eye on you.

1:07:51.071 --> 1:07:52.573
You're unemployable.

1:07:58.787 --> 1:07:59.997
If you want to find the condoms...

1:08:00.163 --> 1:08:03.041
they are in the top left-hand drawer
of his desk...

1:08:03.208 --> 1:08:04.960
next to the Murray Mints.

1:08:17.680 --> 1:08:19.600
Right, so, what're we gonna do?

1:08:19.765 --> 1:08:22.019
Well, Ellis says he doesn't want her
back at work.

1:08:22.185 --> 1:08:25.689
Apparently, she'd already threatened to smash
all his windows with a golf club.

1:08:26.064 --> 1:08:27.983
What? Is that really true?

1:08:28.149 --> 1:08:30.027
I wouldn't put it past her.

1:08:30.194 --> 1:08:31.612
He's called the social services.

1:08:31.778 --> 1:08:34.990
They'll probably take her back into hospital.

1:08:35.157 --> 1:08:36.742
Well, how come he gets away with it?

1:08:37.658 --> 1:08:39.036
It just seems so unfair.

1:08:39.203 --> 1:08:41.580
Look, she's probably better off
in St. Jude's.

1:08:41.747 --> 1:08:43.624
How can she be better off
in a mental hospital?

1:08:43.790 --> 1:08:45.417
They know how to deal with it.

1:08:45.584 --> 1:08:46.376
No.

1:08:46.542 --> 1:08:48.045
-What are you doing?
-Well, I'm going to see her.

1:08:48.212 --> 1:08:49.462
I don't think that's a good idea.

1:08:49.630 --> 1:08:51.590
I'm not sure how much help you can be.

1:08:51.756 --> 1:08:53.050
Well, I can't just turn my back on her.

1:08:54.426 --> 1:08:55.886
Leave her on her own.

1:08:58.388 --> 1:08:59.223
I can't.

1:09:05.812 --> 1:09:07.064
Hilary!

1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:22.871
What do you want?

1:09:23.037 --> 1:09:24.372
I'm worried about you.

1:09:24.540 --> 1:09:26.625
Well, that's terribly sweet,
but I don't need your concern.

1:09:26.792 --> 1:09:29.169
I thought you might want company,
someone to talk to.

1:09:29.336 --> 1:09:30.671
I'm absolutely fine!

1:09:30.837 --> 1:09:32.548
Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you people?

1:09:32.714 --> 1:09:34.299
All right, all right.

1:09:35.676 --> 1:09:37.301
But I just need to say this.

1:09:38.636 --> 1:09:43.015
What you're going through
is a medical condition, it's an illness.

1:09:43.892 --> 1:09:47.520
And I wanted to make sure that you understand
that it's not your fault.

1:09:54.152 --> 1:09:56.697
Did you take a guide book
out of the library for me?

1:09:58.031 --> 1:09:59.116
Oh, dear.

1:09:59.575 --> 1:10:00.534
What's so funny?

1:10:00.742 --> 1:10:03.078
You don't have to try so hard.

1:10:05.289 --> 1:10:06.832
Just pour me a glass of wine.

1:10:10.294 --> 1:10:12.754
And they said, "No, you can't go in there.
You're not allowed."

1:10:12.921 --> 1:10:16.258
So, I sat there like a good little girl
with my schoolbag at my feet.

1:10:16.425 --> 1:10:17.134
And I waited.

1:10:17.301 --> 1:10:19.303
And I knew it as soon as my father stepped
into the room...

1:10:19.469 --> 1:10:21.430
I could smell the sex on them.

1:10:21.597 --> 1:10:23.098
Such a fucking cliché!

1:10:23.265 --> 1:10:24.850
Sex with the secretary.

1:10:25.017 --> 1:10:26.476
I think my mother knew.

1:10:26.643 --> 1:10:30.189
She kept asking me but I told her nothing.

1:10:31.148 --> 1:10:31.982
Why not?

1:10:32.149 --> 1:10:34.234
Because I was loyal to him. I've no idea why.

1:10:35.777 --> 1:10:37.613
And then she started punishing me.

1:10:37.779 --> 1:10:40.908
She blamed me for my father
withdrawing his affections.

1:10:41.074 --> 1:10:43.202
Because I was "daddy's little girl."

1:10:43.368 --> 1:10:44.369
And when I had my first period...

1:10:44.536 --> 1:10:47.164
she brought the bedsheets
to the breakfast table.

1:10:47.331 --> 1:10:50.626
And said, "Look what your precious
little girl just did!"

1:10:51.627 --> 1:10:52.628
Jesus.

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:54.421
I used to sit in the back of the car
on the way to school...

1:10:54.588 --> 1:10:56.256
and I'd look at the back of her neck.

1:10:56.423 --> 1:10:58.467
I'd just stare at it and think...

1:10:58.634 --> 1:11:01.762
all I have to do is just put my hands
round there and just squeeze!

1:11:06.850 --> 1:11:07.643
Look at your little face!

1:11:08.268 --> 1:11:10.103
You think I'm mad, don't you?

1:11:10.771 --> 1:11:14.066
But I am absolutely sane.

1:11:14.233 --> 1:11:15.859
This has all been planned.

1:11:16.026 --> 1:11:18.779
I've been lying in wait for them
all this time.

1:11:18.946 --> 1:11:20.989
All these people, all these men...

1:11:21.156 --> 1:11:23.408
they will have their comeuppance,
just you see!

1:11:23.575 --> 1:11:26.411
You have had your day, Mr. Donald Ellis!

1:11:26.578 --> 1:11:27.621
Professor Raymond Pattenden...

1:11:27.788 --> 1:11:30.582
how dare you give me a low second,
you corrupt little shit!

1:11:30.749 --> 1:11:33.085
Dr. Ian Laird, you are a fucking fraud!

1:11:33.252 --> 1:11:36.088
And I shall report you
to the highest medical authority in the land!

1:11:36.255 --> 1:11:38.632
You are finished! I will finish you!

1:11:38.799 --> 1:11:40.843
Because I'm the only one who knows the truth,
do you understand me?

1:11:41.009 --> 1:11:42.261
I'm the only one!

1:11:44.221 --> 1:11:46.056
Hello? Miss Small?

1:11:46.223 --> 1:11:47.099
Quick, turn the lights off.

1:11:53.981 --> 1:11:55.482
Don't speak. Don't make a sound.

1:11:56.733 --> 1:12:00.612
Miss Small? It's Constable Bramah
from the Kent Police again.

1:12:00.779 --> 1:12:02.573
We've got social services with us.

1:12:02.739 --> 1:12:03.949
Could you let us in, please?

1:12:04.116 --> 1:12:05.951
Just ignore them. Bastards.

1:12:06.118 --> 1:12:07.286
Miss Small?

1:12:07.452 --> 1:12:10.414
We've received further complaints
from other tenants in the building...

1:12:10.581 --> 1:12:12.916
about loud music and a general disturbance.

1:12:13.083 --> 1:12:17.129
There's also reports
from Mrs. Van Dyck in Flat Seven...

1:12:17.296 --> 1:12:21.049
that you've made several very serious
verbal and physical threats towards her.

1:12:21.216 --> 1:12:22.050
Bitch.

1:12:22.259 --> 1:12:24.803
I'm gonna need you to open this door, please.

1:12:24.970 --> 1:12:27.014
Just stay quiet. They'll go away.

1:12:30.058 --> 1:12:31.351
Miss Small?

1:12:32.644 --> 1:12:33.812
Hilary?

1:12:34.897 --> 1:12:38.483
It's Rosemary Bates here,
Kent Social Services.

1:12:39.610 --> 1:12:40.861
We've met before.

1:12:43.071 --> 1:12:45.073
Hilary, could I come in, please?

1:12:47.409 --> 1:12:48.535
Go now.

1:12:48.702 --> 1:12:49.536
Out the back.

1:12:49.912 --> 1:12:50.746
What?

1:12:50.913 --> 1:12:51.872
Leave. Now.

1:12:52.039 --> 1:12:53.040
The fire escape.

1:12:53.207 --> 1:12:54.416
Why, Hilary?

1:12:54.583 --> 1:12:55.417
I just wanna help.

1:12:55.584 --> 1:12:58.128
You don't get it, do you?
I don't want your fucking help!

1:12:58.295 --> 1:13:00.172
I am not your patient.

1:13:00.339 --> 1:13:02.216
I am not some problem to be solved.

1:13:02.382 --> 1:13:04.635
Hilary, I'm afraid if you don't
open the door...

1:13:04.801 --> 1:13:07.638
we are going to have to force entry.

1:13:08.096 --> 1:13:09.556
Go now.

1:13:11.266 --> 1:13:12.643
Do I make myself clear?

1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:14.061
Do I?

1:13:14.478 --> 1:13:15.354
Yes.

1:13:15.521 --> 1:13:16.355
Good.

1:13:17.314 --> 1:13:19.358
Then fuck off.

1:13:23.195 --> 1:13:24.112
Shit.

1:13:24.279 --> 1:13:26.281
Hilary, please open the door.

1:13:28.116 --> 1:13:29.493
Oh, for goodness sake!

1:13:30.577 --> 1:13:32.871
Just go in there and close the door.

1:13:41.463 --> 1:13:43.382
Hilary, please open the door.

1:13:50.389 --> 1:13:53.183
Hilary, we're asking you one last time.

1:13:53.350 --> 1:13:55.894
Please, open the door.

1:14:37.728 --> 1:14:38.687
May we come in?

1:14:45.611 --> 1:14:46.862
Hello, Hilary.

1:14:52.075 --> 1:14:55.245
It looks like things have got a little bit
out of hand again.

1:14:55.412 --> 1:14:56.955
Is that right?

1:15:00.667 --> 1:15:02.127
You're all packed?

1:15:02.294 --> 1:15:03.378
That's good.

1:15:05.547 --> 1:15:08.592
A good few days' sleep
and you'll be feeling much better.

1:15:16.391 --> 1:15:20.395
We've got a first floor room
all nice and ready for you.

1:15:21.563 --> 1:15:23.315
This one's got a view of the garden.

1:16:30.966 --> 1:16:32.426
<i>And two girls.</i>

1:16:32.593 --> 1:16:35.888
<i>Romping through the desert,
splashing into the ocean.</i>

1:16:37.514 --> 1:16:39.474
Listen for the reel end bell.

1:16:40.893 --> 1:16:42.227
Open the dowser.

1:16:43.896 --> 1:16:45.522
Here comes the first blob.

1:16:45.689 --> 1:16:47.357
And do motor cue.

1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:49.818
<i>After the water, we go on the sand.</i>

1:16:51.028 --> 1:16:53.780
Here comes second blob.

1:16:55.032 --> 1:16:55.949
<i>California, here I come!</i>

1:16:56.116 --> 1:16:57.201
Go!

1:16:57.367 --> 1:16:58.452
Yes!

1:17:01.121 --> 1:17:02.372
Excellent.

1:17:03.707 --> 1:17:05.667
Now, get that one off, lace up reel three.

1:17:05.876 --> 1:17:06.793
And don't dick about.

1:17:18.388 --> 1:17:22.476
Stephen, can you do the inventory
and then you can clock off early?

1:17:22.643 --> 1:17:23.727
Yeah, of course.

1:17:23.894 --> 1:17:24.811
Great.

1:18:00.681 --> 1:18:05.227
<i>More than a hundred white and colored youths
fought a pitched battle against the police.</i>

1:18:05.394 --> 1:18:07.896
<i>Some were as young as 12,
the oldest no more than 20.</i>

1:18:08.564 --> 1:18:09.815
<i>It lasted for eight hours.</i>

1:18:09.982 --> 1:18:10.816
<i>And at the end of it...</i>

1:18:10.983 --> 1:18:14.152
<i>Merseyside's chief constable said
it was a planned attack.</i>

1:18:14.319 --> 1:18:16.029
<i>"We were set up," he said.</i>

1:18:16.196 --> 1:18:18.615
<i>The worst of the rioting
came just after dawn...</i>

1:18:18.782 --> 1:18:22.035
<i>when police faced a hail of stones, bottles,
iron bars...</i>

1:18:22.202 --> 1:18:24.246
<i>I'm feeling very hot with answers like that.</i>

1:18:25.289 --> 1:18:28.292
<i>And now, I gave a very respectable one.</i>

1:18:39.428 --> 1:18:41.680
That'd be one pound ten, please.

1:18:42.514 --> 1:18:43.640
Thank you.

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:49.605
Stephen?

1:18:50.439 --> 1:18:51.565
Ruby.

1:18:52.065 --> 1:18:53.400
Wow. Hi.

1:18:53.567 --> 1:18:55.694
Hi. I didn't know you worked here.

1:18:55.861 --> 1:18:58.822
Yeah. Yeah.
Five months now.

1:18:58.989 --> 1:19:00.699
I thought you wanted to go to university.

1:19:01.033 --> 1:19:04.036
Yeah, well, I tried.
Still trying.

1:19:04.203 --> 1:19:07.414
I'm not at the hospital anymore.
Your mum probably told you.

1:19:07.581 --> 1:19:09.291
No, she didn't say anything.

1:19:10.375 --> 1:19:11.710
It was the hours.

1:19:13.337 --> 1:19:16.256
Those early mornings.
I don't know how they do it.

1:19:16.423 --> 1:19:18.175
Yeah, I know.

1:19:18.717 --> 1:19:20.969
So, what do you do now?

1:19:21.762 --> 1:19:25.015
Well, for the time bein' I'm working
at that bar on the front. Boodles.

1:19:26.475 --> 1:19:27.684
It's fun.

1:19:28.227 --> 1:19:29.686
You should pop in.
Maybe have a drink.

1:19:30.395 --> 1:19:32.773
Yeah. Might do that.

1:19:38.237 --> 1:19:40.572
And in the meantime...

1:19:41.198 --> 1:19:42.991
a box of Maltesers, please.

1:19:44.451 --> 1:19:46.745
Right, yeah, of course.

1:19:48.789 --> 1:19:49.915
Twenty P.

1:19:50.082 --> 1:19:51.208
Thank you.

1:19:54.419 --> 1:19:57.214
Enjoy <i>Stir Crazy.
</i>It's brilliant.

1:19:57.548 --> 1:19:58.757
Thanks.

1:19:59.550 --> 1:20:00.968
See you soon, then?

1:20:01.134 --> 1:20:02.970
Yeah, see you soon.

1:20:17.526 --> 1:20:18.360
It's fine.

1:20:18.527 --> 1:20:20.445
Like this. Okay?

1:20:26.368 --> 1:20:27.619
Did it.

1:20:32.165 --> 1:20:33.250
So, what're you gonna do?

1:20:33.417 --> 1:20:34.418
I don't know.

1:20:35.210 --> 1:20:37.588
Maybe stay here, keep working at the Empire.

1:20:37.754 --> 1:20:38.755
Help Norman out.

1:20:38.964 --> 1:20:39.965
Who?

1:20:40.132 --> 1:20:41.675
The projectionist.

1:20:41.842 --> 1:20:43.427
He is funny.

1:20:43.969 --> 1:20:45.762
And you know what?
I like it up there...

1:20:46.138 --> 1:20:47.681
once you get over the smell.

1:20:50.809 --> 1:20:53.979
Yeah, that's cool.
All those movies for free.

1:20:54.146 --> 1:20:57.900
Well, you don't really
get to watch any of them.

1:20:58.066 --> 1:20:59.151
Why not?

1:21:03.405 --> 1:21:04.406
What is it?

1:21:04.573 --> 1:21:06.325
Nothing. Someone I know.

1:21:06.909 --> 1:21:07.910
Do you want to say hello?

1:21:08.076 --> 1:21:09.494
No, it's fine.

1:21:17.419 --> 1:21:18.545
You okay?

1:21:20.672 --> 1:21:21.673
Stevie?

1:21:22.049 --> 1:21:23.050
What?

1:21:23.217 --> 1:21:24.468
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:21:27.471 --> 1:21:30.474
You know what?
I do feel a bit...

1:21:31.683 --> 1:21:33.810
I think I should go back and say hello.

1:21:34.853 --> 1:21:35.938
Okay.

1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:37.731
I'll be quick.

1:21:47.032 --> 1:21:48.116
Hilary.

1:21:50.118 --> 1:21:51.119
Hello.

1:21:52.204 --> 1:21:53.288
How're you?

1:21:54.289 --> 1:21:55.290
I'm good.

1:21:57.543 --> 1:21:58.961
So, you're back.

1:22:00.212 --> 1:22:01.213
Yes.

1:22:02.297 --> 1:22:03.715
Out and about again.

1:22:03.882 --> 1:22:04.967
That's good.

1:22:05.259 --> 1:22:06.510
It's great to see you.

1:22:07.052 --> 1:22:08.053
We've missed you.

1:22:10.639 --> 1:22:11.890
I'm sure that's not true.

1:22:12.057 --> 1:22:14.518
You should drop by and say hello to everyone.

1:22:15.519 --> 1:22:16.812
Mr. Ellis has left.

1:22:17.563 --> 1:22:18.939
He moved to Brighton.

1:22:19.398 --> 1:22:20.732
Yes, Neil told me.

1:22:21.817 --> 1:22:23.193
He called me and asked me back.

1:22:24.069 --> 1:22:26.238
Wow. That's brilliant.

1:22:29.992 --> 1:22:30.993
Hello.

1:22:31.159 --> 1:22:33.745
-Hi.
-Hilary, this is Ruby.

1:22:33.912 --> 1:22:37.249
Ruby, this is Hilary who I know from work.

1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:44.590
So, hopefully, see you soon?

1:22:47.551 --> 1:22:48.552
Yes.

1:23:11.909 --> 1:23:13.368
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

1:23:20.626 --> 1:23:21.752
Thank you.

1:23:32.221 --> 1:23:33.222
Hilary?

1:23:36.058 --> 1:23:37.142
Hilary?

1:23:42.439 --> 1:23:43.982
Hilary, are you all right?

1:23:46.902 --> 1:23:47.903
Stephen.

1:23:49.530 --> 1:23:51.031
Tell me truthfully...

1:23:52.616 --> 1:23:54.493
did I humiliate myself?

1:23:55.160 --> 1:23:56.161
What?

1:23:56.828 --> 1:23:58.163
Tell me. Did I?

1:24:09.925 --> 1:24:12.094
No. It wasn't humiliating.

1:24:13.804 --> 1:24:15.138
It was just...

1:24:16.765 --> 1:24:18.141
intense.

1:24:19.768 --> 1:24:21.019
To be honest...

1:24:21.478 --> 1:24:23.355
I thought you were a bit of a hero.

1:24:26.567 --> 1:24:28.068
That's very nice of you.

1:24:28.986 --> 1:24:30.362
Hard to believe.

1:24:38.787 --> 1:24:41.373
My dad used to take me fishing
when I was little.

1:24:43.417 --> 1:24:45.085
We never caught any fish.

1:24:46.587 --> 1:24:49.131
And for years, I just thought
he was a bad fisherman.

1:24:51.925 --> 1:24:55.596
And then, I realized it was something else.
Something quite simple.

1:24:57.055 --> 1:24:58.974
He didn't know where the fish were.

1:25:00.434 --> 1:25:02.311
And he was too ashamed to ask.

1:25:04.354 --> 1:25:05.898
He was just ashamed.

1:25:11.403 --> 1:25:13.947
Shame is not a healthy condition.

1:25:16.033 --> 1:25:17.951
You should try to forget about it.

1:25:19.203 --> 1:25:20.204
Go in there more often.

1:25:20.370 --> 1:25:21.538
No, I can't. It's my job.

1:25:21.705 --> 1:25:23.582
Yeah, you tear the tickets.

1:25:24.082 --> 1:25:26.043
Make sure they're all in their seats.

1:25:26.585 --> 1:25:28.045
But you never go in.

1:25:28.629 --> 1:25:31.298
You should watch once in a while.

1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:34.760
Yeah, sit in the middle of a bunch of people
who don't know you...

1:25:35.219 --> 1:25:36.678
who've never met you...

1:25:37.888 --> 1:25:39.431
who can't even see you.

1:25:44.019 --> 1:25:45.562
That little beam of light...

1:25:46.730 --> 1:25:48.065
is escape.

1:25:54.905 --> 1:25:56.365
I've missed you.

1:25:58.492 --> 1:25:59.493
Come on.

1:26:00.118 --> 1:26:01.954
We've got a little surprise for you.

1:26:10.254 --> 1:26:13.924
Thank goodness you're here
because I need some of this cake!

1:26:15.843 --> 1:26:17.594
Safeway's finest!

1:26:18.971 --> 1:26:19.972
That one.

1:26:21.473 --> 1:26:24.893
Janine, I've gotta admit.
This song is growin' on me.

1:26:25.060 --> 1:26:26.061
Yeah, it's good.

1:26:28.438 --> 1:26:29.439
What's that?

1:26:31.024 --> 1:26:33.819
-You played it for me.
-Used to be a magazine.

1:26:33.986 --> 1:26:35.195
You hear that?

1:26:36.029 --> 1:26:37.614
Janine, can you turn that down some?

1:26:42.160 --> 1:26:43.328
What's that noise?

1:27:13.025 --> 1:27:14.193
Wow!

1:27:14.902 --> 1:27:16.403
Look at that.

1:27:29.082 --> 1:27:30.709
Leave our jobs alone!

1:27:31.376 --> 1:27:33.086
Come on, skinheads!

1:27:34.671 --> 1:27:36.423
Leave our jobs alone!

1:27:37.591 --> 1:27:40.052
Colored scum! Off our streets!

1:27:40.719 --> 1:27:42.888
Okay, right, lock the doors.

1:27:50.521 --> 1:27:51.897
White is right!

1:28:02.241 --> 1:28:06.119
Hello, princess. What we doing?
Look who it is, boys!

1:28:06.286 --> 1:28:07.204
Let me in!

1:28:21.593 --> 1:28:22.594
Oh, my God!

1:28:31.895 --> 1:28:33.105
Hello, princess!

1:28:34.106 --> 1:28:35.357
Where you fucking going?

1:28:37.651 --> 1:28:39.236
Come on, you fuckin' wog!

1:28:39.403 --> 1:28:41.238
Come on then, you bunch of fucking cowards.

1:28:41.405 --> 1:28:42.781
What did you fuckin' say?

1:28:43.615 --> 1:28:45.117
Look at you,
you can't do anything on your own.

1:28:45.284 --> 1:28:46.702
I ain't a coward, you fuckin' spade!

1:28:46.869 --> 1:28:49.246
Use your imagination, you fucking coward!

1:29:12.519 --> 1:29:14.730
No! Stop it!

1:29:22.696 --> 1:29:24.114
Get off of me!

1:29:24.406 --> 1:29:27.284
What the fuck? Get the fuck off of me!

1:29:44.676 --> 1:29:46.136
You're going to be all right.

1:29:47.054 --> 1:29:48.263
You're strong.

1:30:00.067 --> 1:30:02.110
-What's happened?
-He's had a kicking.

1:30:02.277 --> 1:30:04.696
GCS had dropped to six,
and he just lost consciousness.

1:30:04.863 --> 1:30:06.365
Coming through.
Excuse me, please!

1:30:06.782 --> 1:30:08.408
Respiration's at 35 per minute.

1:30:08.575 --> 1:30:09.576
Move, please!

1:30:09.743 --> 1:30:11.245
Let's get him straight into resus.

1:30:13.830 --> 1:30:14.831
Are you next of kin?

1:30:14.998 --> 1:30:16.208
No, he's my friend, I work with him.

1:30:16.375 --> 1:30:17.709
Next of kin only past this point.

1:30:17.876 --> 1:30:18.877
But will he be all right?

1:30:19.044 --> 1:30:20.712
If you wanna wait here, we'll let you know.

1:30:52.035 --> 1:30:53.078
Excuse me.

1:30:54.288 --> 1:30:56.373
-Are you waiting for news of Stephen?
-Yes.

1:30:57.749 --> 1:30:59.126
He's going to be all right.

1:30:59.751 --> 1:31:01.086
Thank God.

1:31:01.962 --> 1:31:03.463
Badly bruised all over.

1:31:03.922 --> 1:31:05.799
And he's lost a couple of teeth...

1:31:07.384 --> 1:31:08.844
but he's conscious.

1:31:09.803 --> 1:31:12.181
And he wanted you to know that he was okay.

1:31:12.514 --> 1:31:13.515
That's...

1:31:14.808 --> 1:31:15.976
Thank you.

1:31:21.064 --> 1:31:22.566
I'm so sorry.

1:31:26.069 --> 1:31:27.070
Yes.

1:31:28.697 --> 1:31:30.532
It's a bad situation.

1:31:34.786 --> 1:31:37.456
Anyway, you can go home now.
You must've been waiting here for hours.

1:31:37.748 --> 1:31:39.583
Yeah. I'll just get my things.

1:31:44.421 --> 1:31:46.340
Are you the one
that he went to the beach with?

1:31:46.507 --> 1:31:47.508
Yes.

1:31:54.181 --> 1:31:55.766
Yes, we did go to the beach.

1:32:35.681 --> 1:32:38.767
<i>Now the time is almost
six-and-a-half minutes past 12...</i>

1:32:38.934 --> 1:32:40.686
<i>and BBC One is closing down.</i>

1:32:41.478 --> 1:32:42.563
<i>So, from all of us here...</i>

1:32:42.729 --> 1:32:45.983
<i>this is Henry Brooks
wishing you a very good night.</i>

1:33:36.658 --> 1:33:39.661
I have to say, I miss our young friend.

1:33:42.039 --> 1:33:44.625
I was getting used to having someone
to help me with all this.

1:33:46.460 --> 1:33:47.878
You been to visit him?

1:33:48.337 --> 1:33:49.671
Couple of weeks ago.

1:33:52.799 --> 1:33:53.967
Not since?

1:33:54.134 --> 1:33:55.135
No.

1:33:55.969 --> 1:33:57.179
Go and see him.

1:33:57.804 --> 1:33:58.972
Don't run away.

1:34:00.057 --> 1:34:01.433
Is that what I'm doing?

1:34:02.392 --> 1:34:03.894
Seems like it.

1:34:12.277 --> 1:34:14.029
What're you frightened of, Hilary?

1:34:28.752 --> 1:34:29.795
I've got a son.

1:34:32.172 --> 1:34:33.423
Christopher.

1:34:34.341 --> 1:34:35.968
He's 22 now.

1:34:37.803 --> 1:34:39.263
Lives in London.

1:34:46.478 --> 1:34:48.689
I haven't seen him since he was eight.

1:34:49.189 --> 1:34:50.190
What?

1:34:51.316 --> 1:34:52.776
Doesn't want to see me.

1:34:53.944 --> 1:34:55.320
I don't blame him.

1:34:57.614 --> 1:35:01.493
Basically, I ran away.

1:35:03.704 --> 1:35:04.705
Why?

1:35:07.332 --> 1:35:08.333
What?

1:35:09.251 --> 1:35:10.502
Why?

1:35:18.135 --> 1:35:19.761
I can't remember.

1:35:30.355 --> 1:35:33.817
Hi. Can I go to ward one?

1:35:33.984 --> 1:35:35.360
Thank you.

1:35:47.664 --> 1:35:48.707
Thank you.

1:36:00.594 --> 1:36:04.556
A couple of cracked ribs.
So, it's a bit sore when I laugh.

1:36:05.557 --> 1:36:07.142
But the swelling's gone down.

1:36:07.309 --> 1:36:09.978
My eyesight's okay. So...

1:36:10.938 --> 1:36:13.482
I'm so sorry, Stephen.
I don't know what to say.

1:36:13.941 --> 1:36:15.150
There's nothing to say.

1:36:16.026 --> 1:36:19.279
It's happened to my mum,
it's happened to me...

1:36:20.906 --> 1:36:22.950
it'll probably happen to my children.

1:36:25.077 --> 1:36:26.703
Sometimes I think...

1:36:28.205 --> 1:36:29.873
what's the fucking point?

1:36:34.002 --> 1:36:35.462
Here. I got you something.

1:36:38.090 --> 1:36:40.092
It just came out.
I thought you might like it.

1:36:41.718 --> 1:36:43.470
Oh, my God.

1:36:44.972 --> 1:36:46.557
The chap in the shop gave me a funny look.

1:36:46.723 --> 1:36:49.226
But then, I suppose,
I don't look much like a "Rude Girl."

1:36:51.270 --> 1:36:52.271
Sorry.

1:36:55.107 --> 1:36:56.650
That's so nice of you.

1:36:58.485 --> 1:37:00.988
I didn't really get
what was so special about it all before.

1:37:01.738 --> 1:37:04.658
But, Black kids and white kids
meeting up together...

1:37:05.033 --> 1:37:06.577
makes it all normal.

1:37:08.203 --> 1:37:09.204
Yeah.

1:37:10.747 --> 1:37:11.748
Good music, too.

1:37:11.915 --> 1:37:12.916
Hello.

1:37:14.209 --> 1:37:16.420
It's okay, you don't need to leave.
I'm just doing last check-ups.

1:37:16.587 --> 1:37:19.298
No, I should go.
I've got stuff to do, and it's getting late.

1:37:19.464 --> 1:37:21.008
I don't want to be a bother.

1:37:21.175 --> 1:37:22.509
Bye, then.

1:37:22.676 --> 1:37:23.677
Bye, Hilary.

1:37:26.305 --> 1:37:27.514
Thanks for coming.

1:37:28.056 --> 1:37:29.057
Bye.

1:37:42.905 --> 1:37:44.156
Hilary.

1:37:56.210 --> 1:37:57.669
Look, Hilary...

1:37:59.213 --> 1:38:01.340
I don't know what's gone on
between you two...

1:38:02.883 --> 1:38:04.301
and I don't really want to.

1:38:06.386 --> 1:38:10.516
But you should know
that he was askin' after you.

1:38:12.768 --> 1:38:14.144
He likes you.

1:38:17.397 --> 1:38:18.565
You cheer him up.

1:38:20.734 --> 1:38:21.735
So...

1:38:50.806 --> 1:38:52.724
Empire Cinema on the front, please.

1:39:06.071 --> 1:39:07.364
Show me a film.

1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:09.658
What?

1:39:10.242 --> 1:39:11.743
Show me a film.

1:39:11.910 --> 1:39:13.453
I want to see a film.

1:39:16.623 --> 1:39:18.083
What film?

1:39:19.960 --> 1:39:21.628
Any film.

1:39:21.795 --> 1:39:23.130
You choose.

1:41:08.026 --> 1:41:09.278
<i>I see.</i>

1:41:09.695 --> 1:41:11.446
<i>That's a very small room.</i>

1:41:12.614 --> 1:41:14.283
<i>Yes, sir. I guess that's true.</i>

1:41:14.867 --> 1:41:16.285
<i>Smallest room in the house.</i>

1:41:16.451 --> 1:41:18.745
<i>Yes, I guess that's true.</i>

1:41:24.793 --> 1:41:26.753
<i>I feel very good in here.</i>

1:41:28.380 --> 1:41:30.048
<i>That's the oxygen.</i>

1:41:33.844 --> 1:41:36.638
<i>As long as the roots are not severed...</i>

1:41:37.764 --> 1:41:39.016
<i>all is well.</i>

1:41:39.808 --> 1:41:43.687
<i>And all will be well in the garden.</i>

1:42:25.437 --> 1:42:26.480
<i>Life...</i>

1:42:30.192 --> 1:42:31.693
<i>is a state of mind.</i>

1:43:03.725 --> 1:43:06.144
It was just wonderful.
I can't wait to see it again.

1:43:06.311 --> 1:43:07.187
Yeah.

1:43:07.354 --> 1:43:09.231
Peter Sellers is the funniest.

1:43:09.398 --> 1:43:11.358
You should see him
in <i>Return of the Pink Panther.</i>

1:43:11.525 --> 1:43:14.778
"I did not know the bank was being robbed."

1:43:14.945 --> 1:43:16.572
-Hilarious.
-I can't wait.

1:43:16.738 --> 1:43:17.739
And there are so many others.

1:43:17.906 --> 1:43:18.824
I'm gonna need you to make me a list.

1:43:18.991 --> 1:43:19.908
Of course...

1:43:20.659 --> 1:43:21.368
Look...

1:43:21.535 --> 1:43:23.412
I was thinking we could make it
a weekly thing, midnight screenings.

1:43:23.579 --> 1:43:25.414
-I'm sure we could persuade Norman...
-I've got a place at college.

1:43:29.543 --> 1:43:31.253
I'm going to college.

1:43:34.214 --> 1:43:36.175
I got a letter two weeks ago.

1:43:36.341 --> 1:43:37.801
A place opened up.

1:43:40.762 --> 1:43:42.764
Well, that's wonderful! Where?

1:43:44.183 --> 1:43:45.058
Bristol.

1:43:47.352 --> 1:43:48.729
Architecture.

1:43:51.940 --> 1:43:53.275
You did it.

1:43:57.279 --> 1:43:58.864
You told me not to give up.

1:44:03.535 --> 1:44:05.120
Well, Stephen, congratulations.

1:44:05.287 --> 1:44:06.538
You deserve it.

1:44:13.795 --> 1:44:14.963
When are you leaving?

1:44:16.423 --> 1:44:17.716
Tomorrow.

1:44:20.177 --> 1:44:21.261
Ah.

1:44:31.438 --> 1:44:32.940
What did you get?

1:44:33.106 --> 1:44:34.107
New shoes.

1:44:34.274 --> 1:44:35.609
And those books for the course.

1:44:35.776 --> 1:44:37.027
That's great.

1:44:39.738 --> 1:44:40.572
Did you tell her?

1:44:41.323 --> 1:44:42.366
Yeah.

1:44:43.659 --> 1:44:45.035
Was she okay?

1:44:45.702 --> 1:44:46.870
Yeah.

1:44:50.332 --> 1:44:51.458
No.

1:44:53.293 --> 1:44:55.087
I don't know.

1:44:56.046 --> 1:44:57.130
Well...

1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:01.510
As long as you were kind.

1:45:05.764 --> 1:45:10.435
Now, Ruby is comin' for your goodbye dinner.

1:45:11.270 --> 1:45:12.729
What are we gonna make her?

1:45:17.568 --> 1:45:18.318
No, no, no.

1:45:18.485 --> 1:45:19.945
Don't break the glass, Stevie.
Those are the good ones.

1:45:20.112 --> 1:45:21.154
All right, Mum. Calm down.

1:45:21.321 --> 1:45:22.739
I'll be gone tomorrow.

1:45:27.578 --> 1:45:28.579
So here's to the future.

1:45:30.455 --> 1:45:31.915
And to good music.

1:45:35.252 --> 1:45:36.545
And to getting back up.

1:45:40.382 --> 1:45:42.885
And here's to Richard Pryor
and John Belushi...

1:45:45.179 --> 1:45:46.346
and Mars Bars...

1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:50.017
and sandcastles...

1:45:53.437 --> 1:45:54.938
and my new suede shoes.

1:45:58.483 --> 1:46:00.194
And here's to going away.

1:46:01.195 --> 1:46:02.279
And coming home.

1:46:07.367 --> 1:46:08.660
And now I need to pee.

1:46:12.039 --> 1:46:13.457
God, Mrs. Murray.

1:46:14.291 --> 1:46:16.210
He's so different from before.

1:46:19.546 --> 1:46:22.090
He's lived a little bit of life, I think.

1:46:25.135 --> 1:46:26.803
A little bit of life.

1:46:39.274 --> 1:46:40.442
Here.

1:46:40.609 --> 1:46:41.818
Read it later.

1:46:47.199 --> 1:46:48.450
Thanks, Hilary.

1:46:50.869 --> 1:46:52.454
You're going to have a wonderful time.

1:46:53.789 --> 1:46:54.915
But I am going to miss you.

1:46:56.291 --> 1:46:57.167
Yeah.

1:46:57.918 --> 1:46:59.044
I'll miss you, too.

1:47:02.548 --> 1:47:03.799
Okay. Off you go.

1:47:09.471 --> 1:47:10.347
Okay.

1:47:19.940 --> 1:47:21.149
So, I'll see you in the holidays maybe.

1:47:21.316 --> 1:47:22.693
Yeah. That'd be lovely.

1:47:26.238 --> 1:47:27.072
Okay...

1:47:29.199 --> 1:47:30.033
Bye.

1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:31.034
Bye.

1:47:46.633 --> 1:47:47.801
Stephen!

1:48:27.466 --> 1:48:30.594
<i>"The trees are coming into leaf...</i>

1:48:31.470 --> 1:48:34.097
<i>"like something almost being said.</i>

1:48:36.141 --> 1:48:39.228
<i>"The recent buds relax and spread.</i>

1:48:40.604 --> 1:48:43.315
<i>"Their greenness is a kind of grief.</i>

1:48:46.235 --> 1:48:50.197
<i>"Is it that they are born again
and we grow old?</i>

1:48:51.073 --> 1:48:54.076
<i>"No, they die, too.</i>

1:48:55.994 --> 1:48:58.163
<i>"Their yearly trick of looking new...</i>

1:48:58.622 --> 1:49:02.125

1:49:08.757 --> 1:49:12.135
