01:59.452 --> 02:01.818
What is wrong with you?

02:01.820 --> 02:04.448
Damn, you crazy bitch.

02:04.450 --> 02:05.283
Sorry.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.778
Bad dream.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.729
You're fucking psycho, you know that?

02:12.147 --> 02:14.697
Does that mean
you don't want to go again?

02:16.890 --> 02:18.653
Jonni, I'm name is Jonni.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.747
Hell no, I don't want
to go again with you.

02:23.052 --> 02:24.063
You're fuckin' crazy.

02:26.220 --> 02:27.393
Suit yourself.

02:29.970 --> 02:30.803
Fuck.

02:40.780 --> 02:41.613
Hey buddy.

02:42.749 --> 02:43.582
Hey.

03:46.110 --> 03:48.398
He's ready for you now, Kira.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.148
- Thanks, Deana.
- Yeah.

03:50.150 --> 03:52.138
How long are you in town for this time?

03:52.140 --> 03:54.908
Oh, it depends.

03:54.910 --> 03:56.688
Hopefully not as long as last time

03:56.690 --> 03:58.663
but you know how it is with family.

04:00.030 --> 04:01.208
But at least I have this place

04:01.210 --> 04:03.423
to come back to and make a few bucks.

04:06.010 --> 04:08.943
How's your little brother doing?

04:10.790 --> 04:13.768
My little brother is six foot-five now

04:13.770 --> 04:16.083
and he's going to
Dartmouth like I did, so.

04:17.029 --> 04:20.618
I remember when your brother
was going into high school.

04:20.620 --> 04:23.223
- He's grown up fast.
- Yeah.

04:24.900 --> 04:25.973
Sometimes they do.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.353
Yeah.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.050
Yeah, I'll go in.

04:38.640 --> 04:43.307
What I said was you were
showing signs of improvement.

04:44.290 --> 04:46.878
After all this time, I should hope so.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.338
Because you're
finally sticking to the program.

04:50.340 --> 04:51.433
And I still will,

04:52.950 --> 04:54.143
I promise.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.113
What about Sheila?

05:04.660 --> 05:06.260
She's one of the steps, right?

05:07.320 --> 05:09.890
I don't think I can avoid
her, I have to be there.

05:12.030 --> 05:13.980
I still don't think it's a good idea.

05:14.840 --> 05:19.013
As far as we've come, I'd
hate to see any regression.

05:25.795 --> 05:27.795
No, it's all good doc.

05:29.123 --> 05:31.223
A baby bird's gotta learn to fly sometime.

05:42.770 --> 05:43.603
Don't worry.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.447
We'll always have that weekend in LBI.

06:04.560 --> 06:05.393
Ow.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.273
Fuck.

06:17.510 --> 06:18.373
Hello mom.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.763
Yeah, I'll be home in a few hours.

06:28.610 --> 06:29.573
I won't be hungry.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.160
You don't even know what my...

06:39.160 --> 06:39.993
Bitch.

07:32.540 --> 07:33.633
Kira.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.183
- This is a surprise.
- Hi, Mr. Martin.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.948
- Problem with the rent again?
- No.

07:39.950 --> 07:41.808
I have it right here.

07:41.810 --> 07:44.715
Wow, a whole day early.

07:44.717 --> 07:46.045
I know, right?

07:46.047 --> 07:49.398
Does this mean there's
a new man on the horizon?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.093
I thought I heard something last night.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.138
You know Herman's the only man for me.

07:55.140 --> 08:00.140
Speaking of which, I'm leaving
town for a little while.

08:00.310 --> 08:01.660
Could you watch him for me?

08:02.650 --> 08:04.323
Of course, of course.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.573
When will you be back?

08:07.732 --> 08:09.998
It shouldn't be more than a few days.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.089
I can't leave Herman for too long.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.018
All right, well
you take care of yourself.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.636
Thanks, you too, and him.

08:16.638 --> 08:19.221
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.868
- What's up, slut?
- Not much.

09:25.870 --> 09:27.070
What's up with you, fag?

09:29.341 --> 09:30.652
What?

09:30.654 --> 09:33.308
It's not my fault he likes
cock as much as I do.

09:33.310 --> 09:35.338
She's right mom, it's not her fault.

09:35.340 --> 09:38.168
I don't want that kind
of language in this house.

09:38.170 --> 09:40.698
Oh, we'll go out on the porch.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.531
I don't care where you go,

09:41.533 --> 09:43.918
I just don't want you to talk
like that in front of me.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.220
Whatever you say.

09:56.980 --> 09:59.758
- You're so skinny, I love it.
- Do you like it?

09:59.760 --> 10:02.388
- Yeah, it suits you.
- Thanks.

10:02.390 --> 10:06.008
- Light packing, no?
- Yeah, you know me.

10:06.010 --> 10:07.233
Less clothes, more fun.

10:11.040 --> 10:11.873
I'm sorry.

10:18.676 --> 10:22.378
I don't know about
you but I am starving.

10:22.380 --> 10:23.718
Dinner should be about ready.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.743
So why don't you two go wash up?

10:27.010 --> 10:27.843
Okay?

10:34.770 --> 10:36.170
It's good to see you, sis.

10:38.860 --> 10:39.710
You too, Lucas.

11:03.070 --> 11:06.743
Kira, I put fresh
sheets on the bed for you.

11:08.902 --> 11:09.735
Thanks.

12:00.003 --> 12:01.003
Hash-tastic.

12:05.845 --> 12:07.512
I'm being serious.

12:10.074 --> 12:10.907
Oh yum.

12:13.293 --> 12:14.333
Not too much.

12:16.696 --> 12:17.778
Yum.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.863
- Mac and cheese.
- It's your favorite.

12:21.780 --> 12:23.203
When I was like 12.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.510
Let's see here.

12:41.830 --> 12:42.790
What's with that?

12:44.190 --> 12:46.298
Oh, don't ask.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.743
She hasn't even started to
go through anything yet.

12:50.090 --> 12:52.248
You mean nothing's been touched?

12:52.250 --> 12:53.750
It's like a freakin' museum.

12:55.965 --> 12:56.798
Okay.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.438
No, no.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.273
Lucas.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.958
Dear Lord, please bless
this food and bring

13:10.960 --> 13:14.268
strength and dignity
and grace to the Flynn

13:14.270 --> 13:18.033
family for this very difficult week, amen.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.393
Okay.

13:21.395 --> 13:24.168
- Yummy.
- So, how you been Kira?

13:24.170 --> 13:27.038
I feel like we haven't spoken in ages.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.440
That's because we haven't.

13:30.550 --> 13:32.468
Well whose fault is that?

13:32.470 --> 13:35.583
I don't know mom, do you
really wanna talk about it?

13:39.660 --> 13:40.493
Well,

13:41.690 --> 13:43.418
I'm glad you're home.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.473
It just doesn't seem the
same here without you.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.728
It's been well over a decade.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.330
You should be used to it by now.

13:55.620 --> 13:59.568
So honey, do you want me to
tell her or do you want to?

13:59.570 --> 14:02.278
- Tell me what?
- It's nothing.

14:02.280 --> 14:04.738
Don't be modest, your brother got his

14:04.740 --> 14:06.898
first showing at a new
art gallery in town.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.858
He's gonna be the first artist showcased.

14:09.860 --> 14:13.368
Your painting, why didn't you tell me?

14:13.370 --> 14:15.728
It's really not a big deal.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.178
A three week gallery
showing is a very big deal.

14:18.180 --> 14:19.670
- Mom.
- What?

14:19.672 --> 14:21.622
Can't I be proud of one of my children.

14:23.001 --> 14:23.834
Wow.

14:29.570 --> 14:30.403
That's great.

14:32.517 --> 14:33.917
Can I see some of your work?

14:35.650 --> 14:37.173
Sure if you want, later.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.711
If they're anything like your

14:42.713 --> 14:45.248
old cat drawings, I'm
sure they're fabulous.

14:45.250 --> 14:47.858
Okay enough
taking, you need to eat.

14:47.860 --> 14:51.248
- Look at you, you're so skinny.
- I'm on a diet.

14:51.250 --> 14:53.553
Now what kind of diet
would you need to be on?

14:55.140 --> 14:55.973
Liquid.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.723
Better make it last, it's all we got.

15:01.863 --> 15:03.363
I find that hard to believe.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.473
New house rules, doctor's orders.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.040
I forgot the vegetables.

15:12.380 --> 15:13.213
Eat up.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.501
After those vegetables, we're going out.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.103
Whatever you say, sis.

15:23.925 --> 15:24.758
God.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.693
It's like time stood still in here.

15:30.300 --> 15:31.450
Remind you of anyone?

15:37.210 --> 15:38.043
Yeah.

15:39.510 --> 15:42.453
I blew Joe Forte in that corner.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.047
You're not the only one.

15:48.220 --> 15:49.053
What?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.767
GI Joe, you too?

15:54.958 --> 15:58.158
You know what they say,
don't ask, don't tell.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.360
Oh man, that was lame.

16:01.510 --> 16:05.068
Oh, oh, we're gonna need
something much stronger than this.

16:05.070 --> 16:05.903
You got it.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.860
Nothing's changed.

16:11.770 --> 16:12.603
Thanks.

16:13.690 --> 16:15.753
- Yeah, thanks Devon.
- My pleasure.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.988
Thanks, Devon.

16:20.990 --> 16:22.053
Just drink.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.668
To being old.

16:24.670 --> 16:26.203
To being an ass.

16:31.686 --> 16:32.519
Oh man.

16:33.690 --> 16:34.590
I'll take another.

16:44.260 --> 16:45.160
Ah yeah, one more.

16:54.468 --> 16:56.408
Does Davenport still own this place?

16:56.410 --> 16:59.773
Yeah and just about
every other place now too.

17:00.780 --> 17:03.513
God, how can you stay here?

17:04.780 --> 17:06.777
What can I say, I'm a

17:08.470 --> 17:09.683
work in progress.

17:18.631 --> 17:23.631
So...

17:24.193 --> 17:28.022
Shh, shh.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.928
Oh whoa, slow
down, it's a marathon not...

17:33.930 --> 17:36.418
Don't kid yourself,
it's always a sprint.

17:36.420 --> 17:37.720
I got you, doll.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.233
It's Kira.

17:45.810 --> 17:46.860
I've got you, Kira.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.103
It's Kira.

17:54.105 --> 17:56.008
She's cute, come on.

17:56.010 --> 17:57.638
Jesus
Christ what'd you do?

17:57.640 --> 17:59.657
Look at you, you're a mess.

18:03.843 --> 18:06.823
It's my girlfriend from
work, just one of the nurses.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.200
All right, all right, fine.

18:20.570 --> 18:21.520
I'm proud of you.

18:27.980 --> 18:30.598
All right, that's it.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.433
Okay.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.423
Mister big time artist,

18:36.300 --> 18:39.063
I want you to paint a picture just for me.

18:40.038 --> 18:42.078
- What? No.
- Yeah.

18:42.080 --> 18:45.938
I want to commission you to
paint a picture just for me.

18:45.940 --> 18:47.713
You can't afford me.

18:48.850 --> 18:50.663
And I don't have any paint.

18:54.280 --> 18:55.113
Ooh.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.590
Whoa, money bags, holy shit.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.528
Consider yourself officially hired.

19:04.530 --> 19:05.998
Well, I mean...

19:06.000 --> 19:09.825
And you can draw
something but make it good.

19:09.827 --> 19:11.283
I want you to dazzle me.

19:14.410 --> 19:17.818
I am broke, so I'll
take your one dollar.

19:17.820 --> 19:18.651
How can you be broke?

19:18.653 --> 19:19.513
You live at home.

19:22.350 --> 19:23.533
Old habits.

19:25.050 --> 19:27.458
Okay, let's do this.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.760
Oh, are you gonna do me?

19:29.890 --> 19:30.723
Do I look good?

19:31.680 --> 19:34.118
- I don't wanna lie.
- I look drunk?

19:34.120 --> 19:37.338
- Wait, wait, should I pose?
- Go on.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.063
- How's that?
- Too much.

19:41.968 --> 19:43.168
- That's weird.
- Get it?

19:46.655 --> 19:48.905
Don't ever do that again.

19:50.030 --> 19:51.398
Well,

19:51.400 --> 19:52.928
done.

19:52.930 --> 19:53.763
Let me see it.

19:56.310 --> 19:57.143
What is it?

20:00.070 --> 20:01.740
I call it Artist

20:03.202 --> 20:04.035
and the Slut.

20:05.340 --> 20:07.778
Which one am I, the artist or the slut?

20:07.780 --> 20:10.598
Both, based
on your past history.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.692
I mean in the picture.

20:12.694 --> 20:14.398
I don't think it really matters.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.283
I do.

20:16.150 --> 20:17.858
Look, if that one's me,

20:17.860 --> 20:21.351
I have a much better ass than that.

20:21.353 --> 20:23.928
- That is debatable.
- What is that?

20:23.930 --> 20:25.428
What's coming out of your ass?

20:25.430 --> 20:28.161
I don't wanna tell ya.

20:28.163 --> 20:30.926
- I don't think it's...
- Oh my god, Kira?

20:30.928 --> 20:32.297
- Is that you?
- Hey.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.008
- Hey.
- Rachel.

20:34.010 --> 20:36.903
Wow, it's been forever,
what are you doing here?

20:38.470 --> 20:40.973
You know me, I just
really miss this place.

20:42.294 --> 20:44.351
We've been drinking a lot.

20:44.353 --> 20:45.935
Yeah.

20:45.937 --> 20:48.688
And our fuckin' dad died, so.

20:48.690 --> 20:51.063
I heard, I'm so sorry.

20:52.299 --> 20:54.498
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.623
- Kira.
- Hey Brianne.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.123
Hey.

20:59.980 --> 21:02.453
You're still with Darren, shocker.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.038
Hey, what's up?

21:05.040 --> 21:07.882
Yeah and he put a ring on it.

21:07.884 --> 21:09.228
Oh.

21:09.230 --> 21:12.523
Oh, he put a ring on it, Beyonce.

21:12.525 --> 21:16.978
Snap.

21:16.980 --> 21:19.568
I'm just kidding, it's very pretty.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.787
- Yeah, well congrats.
- It's pretty.

21:21.789 --> 21:23.179
Thank you.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.748
But you know, you should be pretty

21:25.750 --> 21:28.663
careful with that 'cause you
don't know where it's been.

21:30.916 --> 21:31.933
She's joking.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.097
What?

21:36.099 --> 21:37.718
Let's go.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.938
What I mean is that Darren really

21:40.940 --> 21:43.463
likes to have things shoved up his ass.

21:45.190 --> 21:46.811
- What are you talking about?
- She's joking.

21:46.813 --> 21:50.363
No, no, no, no, or hasn't
he done that with you yet?

21:51.600 --> 21:54.268
No no no, come on, all good relationships

21:54.270 --> 21:58.261
are about give and take, right Darren?

21:58.263 --> 22:00.294
- You bitch.
- Cool down.

22:00.296 --> 22:05.296
- Yeah, cool down Darren.
- Oh shit.

22:05.736 --> 22:07.362
Get the fuck off of me.

22:07.364 --> 22:09.846
Fuck you.

22:09.848 --> 22:10.681
Hey.

22:11.523 --> 22:13.209
Asshole.

22:13.211 --> 22:14.833
You fuckin' punched me, you pussy.

22:16.730 --> 22:17.793
Real nice, Kira.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.031
Fuck you guys.

22:23.033 --> 22:23.969
Goddammit it.

22:23.971 --> 22:25.508
I told you, she's a fuckin' bitch.

22:25.510 --> 22:26.818
- Jesus.
- Fuckin' mess.

22:26.820 --> 22:29.008
It's all over your shirt.

22:29.010 --> 22:30.393
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

22:34.927 --> 22:36.258
I got it.

22:36.260 --> 22:37.333
I'm hungry.

22:38.970 --> 22:40.837
There was
nowhere else open to go.

22:40.839 --> 22:42.853
I can't believe I
got punched 'cause of you.

22:42.855 --> 22:44.326
- I'm sorry.
- I oughta punch you.

22:44.328 --> 22:46.918
I didn't mean,
you're not gonna punch me.

22:46.920 --> 22:48.153
Yeah I will,

22:49.360 --> 22:50.403
in the boobs.

22:55.050 --> 22:59.428
Can you tuck me in, you
know like you used to?

22:59.430 --> 23:01.283
Tell me a story.

23:02.170 --> 23:03.003
Okay.

23:04.821 --> 23:06.038
- Come on.
- Why don't you go to bed?

23:06.040 --> 23:08.350
- I'll be right there.
- Yeah, I'm going.

24:04.376 --> 24:05.626
So, how's work?

24:06.483 --> 24:07.413
What work?

24:09.848 --> 24:11.393
The catering company, right?

24:12.590 --> 24:14.068
That was

24:14.070 --> 24:15.840
four jobs and

24:16.930 --> 24:18.077
nine months ago.

24:20.401 --> 24:21.232
It's hard to keep steady

24:21.234 --> 24:23.473
employment when you're a raging alcoholic.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.298
I'm sure it is.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.974
Enough chit-chat, tell me a story.

24:30.976 --> 24:32.443
No, I'm too tired.

24:34.090 --> 24:35.143
Maybe tomorrow.

24:37.090 --> 24:37.963
Promise?

24:39.150 --> 24:39.983
Maybe.

24:44.596 --> 24:49.596
Yes, snuggle me.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.693
I missed you, sis.

24:56.268 --> 24:58.268
You could've come home sooner, you know.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.253
Yeah.

25:18.158 --> 25:21.075
You were out drinking last night?

25:22.950 --> 25:24.228
We had a few.

25:24.230 --> 25:26.188
You know what
we need to do today.

25:26.190 --> 25:27.268
Yeah,

25:27.270 --> 25:28.828
so?

25:28.830 --> 25:31.008
So you're in no
condition to see anyone.

25:31.010 --> 25:33.938
Exactly what condition
do I need to be in?

25:33.940 --> 25:34.853
Dad's dead.

25:36.830 --> 25:39.518
He didn't care what shape I was in anyway.

25:39.520 --> 25:42.633
Don't you dare disrespect
your father that way.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.283
When do we need to leave, mom?

25:49.000 --> 25:50.668
I'd like to leave by four.

25:50.670 --> 25:53.768
I still need to make a few
last minute arrangements.

25:53.770 --> 25:55.443
I'll make sure we're ready.

25:56.310 --> 25:57.143
Thank you.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.140
I'll finish getting ready.

26:07.050 --> 26:09.350
Do you always have to
wind her up like that?

26:11.852 --> 26:13.602
A girl's gotta have a little fun.

26:14.870 --> 26:17.123
I thought that was
something you were working on.

26:18.550 --> 26:19.383
Yeah.

26:21.462 --> 26:23.583
It's not a switch I can
just turn on and off.

26:25.030 --> 26:25.923
Like you said,

26:28.430 --> 26:29.283
old habits.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.333
Yeah well,

26:33.690 --> 26:37.083
try harder, if not for her then for me,

26:38.044 --> 26:38.877
okay?

27:06.430 --> 27:08.580
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

27:16.610 --> 27:20.088
Thank you for coming,
it means so much to us.

27:20.090 --> 27:21.708
Of course, if there's anything

27:21.710 --> 27:23.160
I can do for you Mrs. Flynn...

27:24.370 --> 27:25.468
It seems like just yesterday that you

27:25.470 --> 27:29.848
and Kira were in high school,
fighting over the boys.

27:29.850 --> 27:32.143
- I have work.
- We've gotta go.

27:33.830 --> 27:35.880
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

27:43.935 --> 27:45.328
I told you she wouldn't be here,

27:45.330 --> 27:46.478
especially after last night.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.608
Yeah so let's get outta
here before she shows up.

27:48.610 --> 27:50.260
- I'll see you after work.
- Yeah.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.078
Hey,

28:03.080 --> 28:04.213
- Darren.
- Oh shit.

28:05.190 --> 28:06.918
- Wait up.
- Leave me alone.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.438
Hey, I'm surprised you came.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.078
It wasn't my idea,
Brianne said we should

28:10.080 --> 28:13.136
pay our respects since you
used to be friends and all.

28:13.138 --> 28:14.848
I told her you're fucking nuts.

28:14.850 --> 28:16.833
Ah, don't be mad.

28:19.290 --> 28:21.918
I was only playing, you used
to like it when we played.

28:21.920 --> 28:22.833
Don't touch me.

28:24.260 --> 28:25.093
Come on.

28:25.930 --> 28:27.543
There's gotta be something I can do.

28:28.410 --> 28:29.613
Let me make it up to you.

28:36.822 --> 28:37.655
Come on.

28:43.103 --> 28:45.177
- He loved you.
- You were a great son to him.

28:47.040 --> 28:47.873
Sheila.

28:49.572 --> 28:51.418
Thank you Richard, it's very sweet.

28:51.420 --> 28:52.470
Thank you for coming.

28:53.580 --> 28:56.028
Lucas, you remember Mr.
Davenport and Aiden.

28:56.030 --> 28:59.248
So good to see you Lucas,
I'm so sorry for your loss.

28:59.250 --> 29:01.588
- Thank you.
- Yes, very sorry.

29:01.590 --> 29:02.968
Richard was a very good friend

29:02.970 --> 29:05.283
to your father and to our family.

29:06.630 --> 29:10.138
Richard's offered to cover all
the expenses for the funeral.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.840
- It's the least I can do.
- That's very kind of you.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.078
I've asked Richard to say

29:15.080 --> 29:18.298
a few words on your father's behalf.

29:18.300 --> 29:21.573
I just, I couldn't get through it myself.

29:24.000 --> 29:24.853
Where's Kira?

29:26.350 --> 29:27.183
I'm,

29:28.395 --> 29:31.993
I'm not really sure,
Lucas, go get her please.

29:49.447 --> 29:52.898
Oh god.

29:52.900 --> 29:55.198
- Jesus.
- Are you done?

29:55.200 --> 29:56.803
I don't know, are we?

30:03.169 --> 30:05.608
Your whole
family's fucking nuts.

30:05.610 --> 30:08.233
- Call me.
- Mom wants you inside.

30:09.650 --> 30:10.483
Do I have to?

30:18.442 --> 30:19.275
Well,

30:21.898 --> 30:24.148
this should be interesting.

30:51.015 --> 30:51.968
What the fuck is he doing here?

30:51.970 --> 30:53.623
Kira, language.

30:54.910 --> 30:57.210
He's gonna say a few
things about your father.

30:59.530 --> 31:02.393
- Why him?
- Because he's a friend.

31:03.413 --> 31:05.413
You really think that?

31:14.670 --> 31:15.520
Good afternoon.

31:16.860 --> 31:21.458
On behalf of Sheila and Lucas and Kira,

31:21.460 --> 31:23.918
I want to thank all of
you for coming today

31:23.920 --> 31:26.863
to celebrate the life of George Flynn.

31:28.240 --> 31:30.293
Let's start with a moment of silence.

31:39.150 --> 31:41.423
- What happened to your leg?
- Thank you.

31:42.420 --> 31:46.606
Well George, as you know
George was a real family man.

31:46.608 --> 31:48.668
That's a nice dress though.

31:48.670 --> 31:51.627
Interesting choice for your
father's wake but it suits you.

31:53.150 --> 31:55.193
He would do
anything to protect them.

31:57.160 --> 31:59.158
I'll be around if you need anything.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.583
George was a fine man.

32:03.950 --> 32:04.783
A good man.

32:06.330 --> 32:08.503
We knew each other for 25 years.

32:10.320 --> 32:15.320
My dear wife Ava and I
were very, very fond of him

32:15.790 --> 32:19.773
and we shared a lot of wonderful memories.

32:27.235 --> 32:28.298
But I'm sure each and every one of

32:28.300 --> 32:31.407
you has special memories of your own.

33:15.800 --> 33:16.850
Thank you.

33:18.457 --> 33:20.198
- Again, I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.673
Richard, good seeing you.

33:24.290 --> 33:27.598
Those were such sweet things
you said, thank you so much.

33:27.600 --> 33:30.018
- They came from my heart.
- I know they did.

33:30.020 --> 33:30.853
How's Kira?

33:31.790 --> 33:35.548
She'll be fine, she's just
having a hard time adjusting.

33:35.550 --> 33:37.508
It must be difficult for her,

33:37.510 --> 33:39.788
especially with all the issues that she's

33:39.790 --> 33:42.393
had over the years and
for Lucas too of course.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.458
We'll be all right.

33:46.460 --> 33:49.158
Well I'll be here tomorrow but

33:49.160 --> 33:51.756
call me if you need anything at all.

33:51.758 --> 33:53.077
I will, thank you.

34:28.780 --> 34:30.342
Take me back to the office.

34:31.630 --> 34:33.206
I need to finish my speech.

35:32.070 --> 35:33.521
Hey.

35:33.523 --> 35:34.858
Hey.

35:34.860 --> 35:37.423
I couldn't sleep so I
figured what the hell?

35:38.351 --> 35:41.320
I can do my best work when
I'm exhausted or high.

35:44.160 --> 35:48.313
- So which one are you?
- My lips are sealed.

35:56.420 --> 35:57.713
These are really good.

35:58.976 --> 36:01.158
It's just shit, it's shit.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.010
Most of them are.

36:03.490 --> 36:04.323
Oh.

36:05.587 --> 36:07.888
I highly doubt it if you're
getting a gallery showing.

36:07.890 --> 36:08.988
Well mom was making a bigger

36:08.990 --> 36:10.640
deal out of it than it really is.

36:11.780 --> 36:13.568
I just hope I've got a couple of

36:13.570 --> 36:15.220
pieces that people actually like.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.718
Oh.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.488
I see what you're doing.

36:21.490 --> 36:24.078
Always under-promise and...

36:24.080 --> 36:25.680
- Over-deliver.
- Over-deliver.

36:27.210 --> 36:30.228
Right, that was one of dad's favorites.

36:30.230 --> 36:31.063
Yeah.

36:33.460 --> 36:34.293
And

36:35.130 --> 36:37.220
never put the car in

36:39.330 --> 36:43.863
cruise control when it's raining
'cause it will hydroplane.

36:45.780 --> 36:49.328
Or always cut the, no, always hit

36:49.330 --> 36:51.008
- the cutoff man.
- Hit the cutoff man.

36:51.010 --> 36:52.511
I don't even know what that means.

36:52.513 --> 36:55.503
- It's a baseball thing.
- Oh, well that would be why.

37:00.040 --> 37:03.280
Hey, I know it's been a
while since you were up.

37:05.770 --> 37:06.603
Oh.

37:08.140 --> 37:09.868
No.

37:09.870 --> 37:11.450
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- No.

37:12.420 --> 37:16.298
It's fine, I'm just
tired, had a long night.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.443
Yeah, yeah.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.083
So no story tonight either?

37:22.990 --> 37:24.910
- Rain check.
- Sure, goodnight.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.758
Hey, remember to drink some water.

37:29.760 --> 37:30.593
Shut up.

37:54.060 --> 37:55.560
I'll give you a few moments.

38:03.940 --> 38:05.340
I can't believe he's gone.

38:06.460 --> 38:07.713
He's in a better place.

38:09.070 --> 38:11.270
I'm sorry the kids
didn't get here for mass.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.030
It's never been easy with them.

38:19.010 --> 38:21.313
I'm worried about you, Sheila.

38:22.340 --> 38:23.790
You're very fragile right now

38:25.270 --> 38:26.103
and I know that

38:27.250 --> 38:30.128
well, Kira can be unstable.

38:30.130 --> 38:32.398
- If you need any help...
- We're gonna be fine.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.233
Thank you.

38:35.310 --> 38:37.008
Sorry mom, the car wouldn't start.

38:37.010 --> 38:37.843
That's okay.

38:40.104 --> 38:42.727
- Could you put this?
- Oh, absolutely.

38:42.729 --> 38:43.562
Really?

38:44.651 --> 38:45.738
What?

38:45.740 --> 38:47.198
He would've wanted it.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.258
What he would've wanted is a bottle.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.093
Kira.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.698
We'll now deliver your

38:52.700 --> 38:55.023
loved one to his final resting place.

38:58.230 --> 38:59.083
Deliver him.

39:00.170 --> 39:02.233
That makes him sound like
a pizza or something.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.168
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

39:06.170 --> 39:07.298
We appreciate everything that

39:07.300 --> 39:09.503
you've done for us Richard, really we do.

39:10.683 --> 39:12.098
And if the other situation

39:12.100 --> 39:14.640
becomes a problem, just let me know.

39:21.043 --> 39:22.460
What situation?

39:23.990 --> 39:25.248
What situation is he talking about, mom?

39:25.250 --> 39:27.993
Can we just get through today please?

39:44.527 --> 39:45.928
Is everything
okay, Mr. Davenport?

39:45.930 --> 39:47.398
Everything's fine.

39:47.400 --> 39:50.200
Well I kept everything
simple just like the last time.

39:51.230 --> 39:52.063
That's good.

39:53.350 --> 39:54.253
Thank you, sir.

40:10.094 --> 40:12.511
It was a beautiful service.

40:14.510 --> 40:17.208
Your father would have appreciated it.

40:17.210 --> 40:21.373
Yeah, everybody knows how
much dad loved a great funeral.

40:23.510 --> 40:24.810
Not that you would know.

40:27.360 --> 40:30.668
How could you miss your
father's burial service?

40:30.670 --> 40:31.501
How could you?

40:31.503 --> 40:33.778
I wouldn't have missed
it if you had woken me up.

40:33.780 --> 40:35.238
Oh my god, you come home at 2:00 in

40:35.240 --> 40:37.240
the morning drunk and you're blaming me.

40:39.128 --> 40:41.238
It all makes sense, you
blame me for everything else.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.558
Gee, I wonder why?

40:42.560 --> 40:45.828
How many people are
we expecting for lunch?

40:45.830 --> 40:46.998
What?

40:47.000 --> 40:49.967
I've got a little bit of
money, it's not much but...

40:51.740 --> 40:53.228
- I have some money.
- No honey, sweetie.

40:53.230 --> 40:56.258
Thank you for offering
but just I told you,

40:56.260 --> 40:58.060
Richard's taking care of everything.

40:59.780 --> 41:00.680
Of course he is.

41:04.110 --> 41:06.548
Gordon came to me one
day in dire circumstances.

41:06.550 --> 41:10.058
It seems that, well the
costs of a real estate

41:10.060 --> 41:12.338
deal he was working had gone
completely out of control.

41:12.340 --> 41:15.248
The account had come
due and as it turns out,

41:15.250 --> 41:16.768
he had leveraged just about all of

41:16.770 --> 41:18.848
his money to build a shelter by the pier.

41:18.850 --> 41:21.146
- What kind of shelter?
- A women's shelter.

41:21.148 --> 41:22.288
Oh, were
you involved with that?

41:22.290 --> 41:25.228
If I had been, we'd
have both been in trouble.

41:25.230 --> 41:27.298
Anyway Gordon went to all
of his friends to try to

41:27.300 --> 41:30.498
get help but not too many people
can cover a loan that size.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.125
So when he came to me, I
had a decision to make.

41:33.127 --> 41:34.928
Was it a tough decision?

41:34.930 --> 41:37.218
- Oh not really.
- But it was a lot of money.

41:37.220 --> 41:39.488
Yeah but you know,
money isn't everything.

41:39.490 --> 41:41.488
When you come right down to it,

41:41.490 --> 41:44.649
what's most important is
to do the right thing.

41:44.651 --> 41:46.524
It's so true, Richard.

41:50.290 --> 41:51.123
Come on.

41:52.170 --> 41:55.103
Like you'd know anything about that, Dick.

41:57.880 --> 41:59.853
Excuse me, I have a phone call to make.

42:10.479 --> 42:12.878
What is the matter with you?

42:12.880 --> 42:15.343
After everything he has
done for this family.

42:31.490 --> 42:34.378
Don't you think you're laying
it on a little thick, mom?

42:34.380 --> 42:35.213
What?

42:36.170 --> 42:37.973
You can quit the theatrics.

42:39.030 --> 42:40.623
There's nobody in here but us.

42:41.700 --> 42:44.608
Is that what you think,
that I'm faking this?

42:44.610 --> 42:46.758
That I'm enjoying this?

42:46.760 --> 42:49.993
Maybe enjoying it is a little strong.

42:51.340 --> 42:53.340
But you've always relished the attention

42:54.460 --> 42:58.527
and it looks like Richard
is really giving it to you.

43:14.330 --> 43:18.023
I met your father
when I was 15 years old.

43:20.117 --> 43:21.208
Oh god.

43:21.210 --> 43:22.043
Really?

43:23.640 --> 43:25.693
I've heard all of these stories before.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.453
He was the only man I've ever loved.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.840
He was the only man I've ever been with.

43:40.900 --> 43:45.103
Do you know what it's like
to really love someone?

43:47.750 --> 43:48.583
To

43:49.625 --> 43:52.113
depend on someone completely?

43:56.540 --> 43:57.373
Not really.

43:58.900 --> 43:59.993
No, you don't.

44:01.120 --> 44:01.953
But I do.

44:06.630 --> 44:11.383
I lived and I breathed for
your father and now he's gone.

44:15.170 --> 44:16.003
So?

44:17.290 --> 44:18.123
So,

44:20.720 --> 44:21.693
losing him,

44:24.520 --> 44:26.720
losing him feels like
I'm losing everything.

44:29.020 --> 44:33.883
And if my own daughter
thinks that I'm faking it,

44:37.562 --> 44:38.912
then I guess I really have.

44:56.241 --> 44:57.074
Mom,

44:58.960 --> 44:59.793
I'm sorry.

45:05.991 --> 45:07.991
It's just being home and

45:09.150 --> 45:10.103
everything else.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.273
Let's just,

45:47.130 --> 45:48.497
let's just go home.

45:49.819 --> 45:50.652
Yeah.

45:51.789 --> 45:53.539
- Yeah.
- Let's go home.

45:55.740 --> 45:58.578
I told this guy short
that stock, it's no good.

45:58.580 --> 45:59.558
He talks me out of it,

45:59.560 --> 46:01.848
the next day the thing
goes down eight points.

46:01.850 --> 46:02.950
It was all your fault.

46:04.940 --> 46:07.170
Thank you so much for coming.

46:13.670 --> 46:16.363
Touching story earlier, truly.

46:18.770 --> 46:21.028
Wasn't it our construction company

46:21.030 --> 46:22.980
that ran the costs up on that property?

46:35.382 --> 46:37.161
♪ Brownies ♪

46:37.163 --> 46:41.661
♪ Mama's famous brownies, brownies ♪

46:41.663 --> 46:43.513
♪ Makin' makin' brownies ♪

46:43.515 --> 46:44.898
♪ Don't you burn 'em ♪

46:44.900 --> 46:46.397
- What are you two up to?
- Hmm?

46:46.399 --> 46:48.808
Makin' brownies.

46:48.810 --> 46:50.458
Oh my god, not your world famous

46:50.460 --> 46:52.688
double chocolate bonanza brownies.

46:52.690 --> 46:54.173
One and the same.

46:55.290 --> 46:57.058
You haven't made them in years.

46:57.060 --> 46:59.124
We thought it was about time.

46:59.126 --> 47:00.765
All right, you have fun.

47:00.767 --> 47:02.493
I'm gonna head upstairs, I'll be back.

47:03.590 --> 47:05.603
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, why?

47:06.490 --> 47:08.630
Well first you're up before me

47:09.710 --> 47:11.558
and second, you and mom are getting along.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.268
Either one is unbelievable

47:13.270 --> 47:15.288
but combined, it's just mind-blowing.

47:15.290 --> 47:16.123
Yeah.

47:17.050 --> 47:19.853
- Wonders never cease.
- No seriously, what gives?

47:21.190 --> 47:25.143
I don't know, maybe I shouldn't
hold onto things so tight.

47:26.660 --> 47:29.398
Wow, is that something
your shrink told you?

47:29.400 --> 47:31.928
Yeah, I guess it finally sunk in.

47:31.930 --> 47:33.530
Does that mean you're staying?

47:36.760 --> 47:39.983
- Just for a little while.
- Good to have you around.

47:39.985 --> 47:42.178
- Don't be sappy.
- I am sappy.

47:42.180 --> 47:44.155
- What time is it?
- Almost 8:00.

47:44.157 --> 47:44.990
Shit.

47:46.131 --> 47:47.798
What's the matter?

47:51.130 --> 47:52.723
I gotta bring my car to Moro's.

47:54.810 --> 47:57.738
Ooh, a little fancy for the auto shop.

47:57.740 --> 47:59.388
It's all I have.

47:59.390 --> 48:02.575
I'm gonna get a pair of
flat-footers, you want a pair?

48:02.577 --> 48:04.648
I'm good, do you want me to follow?

48:04.650 --> 48:05.997
Nah.

48:05.999 --> 48:07.543
I need the workout for my ass.

48:08.930 --> 48:11.143
Could you make sure the
brownies don't burn?

48:12.610 --> 48:13.443
Piece of cake.

48:14.790 --> 48:17.688
And clean up that mess?

48:17.690 --> 48:19.283
- Fine.
- Thank you.

48:20.720 --> 48:22.553
Fine, I get to eat more.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.978
Sadly, he says it's the alternator

48:41.980 --> 48:43.480
and that's gonna be expensive.

48:44.810 --> 48:47.628
Okay, all right.

48:47.630 --> 48:49.880
I'll give you a call
when it's ready, thanks.

48:52.980 --> 48:55.989
Kira Flynn, is that you?

48:55.991 --> 48:57.443
Hi, Mrs. Moro.

48:57.445 --> 49:01.148
Oh my good, get over
here and give me a hug.

49:01.150 --> 49:03.288
How long has it been since
we've seen each other?

49:03.290 --> 49:06.348
- A few years.
- Oh my goodness.

49:06.350 --> 49:08.738
Oh listen, I'm so sorry
to hear about your dad.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.475
- He was a great guy.
- Yeah.

49:10.477 --> 49:12.798
That's what everybody says.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.883
- How's your mom doing?
- She's mom.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.208
Listen, I have something
in the oven so can we...

49:19.210 --> 49:21.788
Not your double
chocolate bonanza brownies.

49:21.790 --> 49:24.808
- Wow, you remember those.
- Are you kidding?

49:24.810 --> 49:29.798
I used to starve myself so that
I could have one, or three.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.438
Well you always hid it really well.

49:32.440 --> 49:33.540
Big clothes.

49:34.550 --> 49:36.768
How about I bring some
by when I pick up the car?

49:36.770 --> 49:37.918
Would you?

49:37.920 --> 49:39.268
That would be so kind, thank you.

49:39.270 --> 49:41.398
You're an angel, give me your keys.

49:41.400 --> 49:42.231
Great.

49:42.233 --> 49:43.328
And I'll call you when the car's ready.

49:43.330 --> 49:44.988
- Thank you.
- All right.

49:44.990 --> 49:46.417
- Take it easy.
- You too.

49:56.180 --> 49:57.013
Kira?

49:58.100 --> 49:59.608
What are you doing here?

49:59.610 --> 50:02.253
My dad bought this
place a couple years back.

50:04.520 --> 50:06.808
Good people but they don't know
shit about bookkeeping, so.

50:06.810 --> 50:09.578
Great, another addition
to the Davenport dynasty.

50:09.580 --> 50:12.482
- Just what this town needs.
- Hang on where are you going?

50:12.484 --> 50:13.317
Hang on.

50:14.350 --> 50:18.168
- Easy, I just wanted to talk.
- About what?

50:18.170 --> 50:19.003
I don't know,

50:20.734 --> 50:23.298
the good old days I guess,
when we were friends.

50:23.300 --> 50:25.048
I haven't seen you in years.

50:25.050 --> 50:27.443
Seeing you the other night
brought back some memories.

50:28.650 --> 50:30.928
I know we were kids but it
was still a crazy night.

50:30.930 --> 50:32.343
I think about it sometimes.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.003
I remember it.

50:37.630 --> 50:40.030
You used to follow me
around like a puppy dog.

50:44.430 --> 50:46.368
That was before I knew any better.

50:46.370 --> 50:50.328
Yeah well, we should go for a drink or

50:50.330 --> 50:51.680
whatever while you're here.

50:53.148 --> 50:55.371
I gotta go.

50:55.373 --> 50:56.473
I'll see you around.

51:08.870 --> 51:10.570
I set the timer for the brown...

51:13.495 --> 51:14.328
Mom.

51:18.630 --> 51:19.933
Don't, I'm okay.

51:21.330 --> 51:24.518
I know but everyone
needs a hug now and then.

51:24.520 --> 51:25.923
Yes we do, don't we?

51:28.210 --> 51:29.993
So you and Kira are getting along.

51:30.980 --> 51:31.813
Yeah.

51:32.925 --> 51:34.975
It's good to have my daughter back again.

51:37.080 --> 51:39.828
Maybe something good will
come out of all this.

51:39.830 --> 51:43.208
I just, I hope it lasts.

51:43.210 --> 51:44.493
I wouldn't worry about that.

51:47.850 --> 51:49.500
You know I couldn't have gotten

51:50.800 --> 51:53.028
through any of this without you.

51:53.030 --> 51:53.863
I know.

51:57.720 --> 51:59.463
I figure this makes us even.

52:02.190 --> 52:03.063
You think so?

52:07.432 --> 52:10.765
Now, do you want a hand with anything?

52:11.760 --> 52:14.177
No, I'm just not ready yet.

52:21.410 --> 52:22.243
Shit.

52:31.916 --> 52:32.749
Goddammit.

52:44.619 --> 52:46.119
You need a lift?

52:49.290 --> 52:51.340
You can't walk all the way home barefoot.

52:54.810 --> 52:56.960
It'd be a shame to ruin
that nice pedicure.

52:59.330 --> 53:00.580
Straight home, I promise.

53:19.100 --> 53:23.248
- Oh, a private stash.
- Always be prepared.

53:23.250 --> 53:25.493
Pretty impressive
for this early in the morning.

53:26.479 --> 53:28.718
Is there a question
hidden behind that judgment?

53:28.720 --> 53:30.268
What happened?

53:30.270 --> 53:32.058
What makes you think something happened?

53:32.060 --> 53:34.808
Well when you left, you
were practically giddy,

53:34.810 --> 53:37.373
for Kira anyway, now not so much.

53:38.850 --> 53:41.218
I shouldn't say that right now.

53:41.220 --> 53:42.370
Blurry is a good thing.

53:46.460 --> 53:49.048
Well I can't let you drink alone.

53:49.050 --> 53:50.678
Besides I've got a
really important meeting

53:50.680 --> 53:53.243
later tonight, this will
help me calm my nerves.

53:56.427 --> 53:57.510
Ooh God, ugh.

53:59.060 --> 54:00.007
Calm nerves.

54:25.875 --> 54:28.718
I know it's a hard time for you but

54:28.720 --> 54:31.323
you might be surprised, I'm
actually a pretty good listener.

54:37.800 --> 54:40.878
I mean I know how difficult
it is to deal with family.

54:40.880 --> 54:43.088
- Come on.
- What?

54:43.090 --> 54:45.978
You're Aiden Davenport,
Prince of the fucking...

54:45.980 --> 54:47.053
Oh yeah.

54:48.540 --> 54:51.483
It's real easy being Richard
Davenport's son, yeah.

54:52.501 --> 54:53.793
You should try it sometime.

54:54.980 --> 54:57.318
Really you're just living in his shadow.

54:57.320 --> 54:58.970
I think I'd rather be my own man.

55:14.150 --> 55:17.358
- Hello?
- Sheila, it's Richard.

55:17.360 --> 55:18.598
Hi Richard.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.163
I'm just checking in
to see how you're doing.

55:22.330 --> 55:24.738
As good as can be expected I guess.

55:24.740 --> 55:27.888
I really appreciate
everything you've done for us.

55:27.890 --> 55:29.368
I know how busy you are.

55:29.370 --> 55:31.713
The Flynns are always a priority for me.

55:32.820 --> 55:34.053
What about Kira?

55:35.540 --> 55:37.148
What about Kira?

55:37.150 --> 55:40.428
It looked like
you two were having a moment

55:40.430 --> 55:43.373
yesterday, I just wanted to
make sure everything was okay.

55:44.260 --> 55:46.460
It's fine, it was
just a misunderstanding.

55:47.940 --> 55:50.198
Kids, no matter how much you do for 'em,

55:50.200 --> 55:52.248
it never seems to be enough.

55:52.250 --> 55:54.398
I'm not sure what you mean.

55:54.400 --> 55:55.708
I just mean that Aiden and I have

55:55.710 --> 55:58.360
had our misunderstandings over the years

55:59.330 --> 56:01.868
and I've always felt
that strict discipline

56:01.870 --> 56:03.813
is the most effective approach.

56:04.820 --> 56:07.288
Well they're not children, Richard.

56:07.290 --> 56:09.998
They need to be responsible
for their own lives.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.200
We just need to support
them as best we can.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.028
Is there anything else that
I can help you with, Richard?

56:19.030 --> 56:20.880
I've really gotta get to some things.

56:21.860 --> 56:25.263
No, as long as you're okay,
what more can I ask for?

56:52.840 --> 56:54.568
Make sure she brings her tonight.

56:54.570 --> 56:55.720
Of course.

57:03.950 --> 57:04.783
We're done.

57:16.930 --> 57:20.208
- What are you doing here?
- Moro's numbers are a mess.

57:20.210 --> 57:23.118
I need last year's, I'm
also behind on the quota.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.523
But aren't you always?

57:26.210 --> 57:28.083
- Is that your big speech?
- Yes.

57:29.160 --> 57:30.818
And don't forget, we have

57:30.820 --> 57:32.668
the ribbon cutting at
the pediatric clinic.

57:32.670 --> 57:34.770
- I can't, I have a meeting.
- Cancel it.

57:36.410 --> 57:39.728
This is more than just
a $30 million name tag.

57:39.730 --> 57:41.645
This is important for both of us.

57:41.647 --> 57:44.233
- Oh, I understand.
- The girl will be there.

57:49.690 --> 57:50.521
What time?

57:50.523 --> 57:51.928
Now you be sure to tell the old man

57:51.930 --> 57:54.328
I talked you into that
60,000 mile warranty.

57:54.330 --> 57:56.918
I'll blame it on you, don't
worry about that, thank you.

57:56.920 --> 57:58.628
- Take it easy, Chris.
- Bye bye.

57:58.630 --> 57:59.463
Bye bye.

58:00.430 --> 58:02.478
Well hey Lucas, how are you doing?

58:02.480 --> 58:04.988
Right as rain, and
how are you Mrs. Moro?

58:04.990 --> 58:07.563
You know if I felt any
better, I would be you.

58:10.079 --> 58:12.588
Oh my goodness, are these
what I think they are?

58:12.590 --> 58:15.018
- Yes they are.
- Oh, thank you so much

58:15.020 --> 58:16.818
- and thank Kira for me.
- Of course.

58:16.820 --> 58:18.968
- Is her car ready yet?
- Oh yeah.

58:18.970 --> 58:20.420
Hang on, let me get the keys.

58:29.460 --> 58:34.218
Lucas, let me guess,
cleaning up after Kira again?

58:34.220 --> 58:36.068
What makes you say that?

58:36.070 --> 58:38.370
I ran into her when
she dropped the car off.

58:39.850 --> 58:40.823
Any news?

58:42.220 --> 58:44.268
Yes, yes.

58:44.270 --> 58:45.878
Everyone's very excited.

58:45.880 --> 58:47.558
Listen, I've got a thing
later with my father

58:47.560 --> 58:49.668
but then afterwards, I'm
getting some of the buyers

58:49.670 --> 58:51.218
together and we're gonna
have a little drink.

58:51.220 --> 58:53.683
You, you should definitely come.

58:55.288 --> 58:56.418
I can make that work.

58:56.420 --> 58:57.253
Good.

58:58.480 --> 59:00.180
You think Kira might want to join?

59:02.340 --> 59:03.173
Maybe.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.033
Great.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.338
See what you can do.

59:07.340 --> 59:08.403
You know I will.

59:11.534 --> 59:13.028
Here you go.

59:13.030 --> 59:14.830
There anything else I can do for ya?

59:35.650 --> 59:37.883
- Oh, salad.
- It's good for you.

59:41.800 --> 59:45.282
Honey, I was hoping that you
could help with something.

59:45.284 --> 59:46.434
Yeah sure, what's up?

59:47.540 --> 59:49.098
Actually I was hoping
you could help me go

59:49.100 --> 59:52.633
through some of the boxes
with your father's things.

59:54.210 --> 59:57.260
I tried the other day, I just,

59:58.784 --> 01:00:00.753
I just wasn't ready, it was too hard.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:04.073
Of course.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:09.108
I mean not everything, just some of it.

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:11.093
I don't even know what half the stuff is.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.008
Yeah.

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.838
- When do you wanna do it?
- Soon.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.673
You know?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.563
Are you going out again?

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:31.413
I have to pick some things
up at the store but, no.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.773
I think I'll stay in.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.450
Catch up on some reading.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:40.503
I'd like that.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.088
Just don't be late for dinner.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:43.953
Yeah, okay.

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.393
Hey sweetheart, good to see you today.

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.808
Hello Aiden.

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:18.008
Let's get this started, okay?

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:19.478
I want to thank the
press and I want to thank

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.238
all our friends for coming
out here today, Richard?

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.018
Thank you, I'd also
like to introduce to you

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:26.598
a young friend of ours who's gonna be one

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.428
of the many beneficiaries
of this fine center.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:32.308
Please say hello to Miss Ellie Foster.

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.860
Her name is Emma.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.350
So it's with great pride
and excitement that we now

01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.548
break ground for Bridgewood Hospital's

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:47.498
newest facility, the
Davenport Children's Center.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.343
Gimme a hand here.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:57.753
Okay, we got it?

01:01:58.681 --> 01:01:59.898
Okay, thank you.

01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:29.848
Lucas.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.650
Lucas, where the fuck have you been?

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.608
Get your ass over here, get
over here, get over here.

01:02:35.610 --> 01:02:38.298
Sit down, sit down, what
the hell took so long?

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.090
- It was my mom.
- Ah, mom.

01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:42.833
No Kira, huh?

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.692
Yeah, she wasn't up for it.

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:20.728
- Who's Kira?
- She's just a friend.

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.203
Look, where's my manners?

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.058
This is Lucas

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.468
and this is Cindy and?

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:30.588
- I'm Penny.
- Penny.

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:32.343
How could I forget, my lucky Penny?

01:03:33.859 --> 01:03:35.359
A pleasure to meet you both.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:38.122
So are they buyers?

01:03:40.702 --> 01:03:41.998
I love this guy.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.008
No, no no, they're not buyers.

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:46.928
I talked to most of the buyers, they left.

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:50.488
Cindy and Penny work for my
father, they're receptionists.

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:54.163
That's right, we're very receptive.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.248
Hey, we were just getting
ready to go back to my place.

01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:05.173
The three of us, a little
after party, you care to join?

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:08.008
Actually I've not been feeling

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:10.638
well tonight and I wasn't gonna come.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.748
- So not tonight.
- I'm glad you did then.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.703
Hey ladies, I'll meet you outside.

01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:29.430
So, is one of them your girlfriend?

01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:32.523
You're cute.

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.238
Listen, I have to catch you up though,

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.558
I got so much to tell you.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.110
The meetings went well tonight.

01:04:39.206 --> 01:04:40.888
We should have dinner tomorrow night.

01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:42.016
- Yes?
- Sure.

01:04:42.018 --> 01:04:43.118
Talk about the gallery,
I'll get you ready.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.028
The music sucks here tonight.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.888
Victor, you
beautiful son of bitch.

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:50.693
- Still here, yes.
- Of course I am.

01:04:52.017 --> 01:04:54.748
It's a busy city and I've
got my busy signals on.

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:56.348
Who do we have here?

01:04:56.350 --> 01:05:00.823
This my friend is the
magnificent Lucas Flynn.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.508
Ah, the young man you've
been telling me about.

01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:05.888
Exactly.

01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.268
Pleasure to meet you.

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.772
Yes, I'm sure it is.

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:11.168
Victor is one of our
art buyers, he's from LA.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:13.348
Every once in awhile he comes over

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:16.438
to the East Coast and slums it with us.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.328
Well I'm always looking
for hidden talents

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:23.128
and you have to tell me
all about yourself because

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:25.298
if you're as good as
Aiden claims that you are,

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.661
- I must know everything.
- See, I told you.

01:05:28.663 --> 01:05:31.839
Well it's all true.

01:05:31.841 --> 01:05:33.288
What is?

01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.694
Everything good that he said is true.

01:05:35.696 --> 01:05:36.529
What did I say?

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:42.483
I don't know, I guess I'm
inspired by Dali, Frida.

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:47.551
Child, I'm kidding, he's cute.

01:05:47.553 --> 01:05:49.178
- I know, I told you.
- You know,

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.108
I'm not feeling that well tonight though.

01:05:51.110 --> 01:05:53.358
- So I'm gonna head home.
- Head home?

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.783
That's nonsense, I got
a pick me up package.

01:05:58.831 --> 01:06:01.078
- Uh-oh.
- That will work for everyone.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.643
- Where are you off to?
- Oh, business calls.

01:06:06.706 --> 01:06:09.808
- Come on, don't be scared.
- I'm not scared.

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:12.208
Oh yeah, that's it.

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.283
Oh, oh yeah, good boy.

01:06:17.038 --> 01:06:20.700
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:23.918
Oh.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.828
- I was so close.
- You are a sick fucker.

01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:27.683
So good.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:30.733
Listen,

01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:36.488
- I hate to ask.
- Oh please.

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:38.758
If you hated to ask, you wouldn't.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.888
Will you please help me pick out

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:42.640
the pieces for the gallery tonight?

01:06:43.527 --> 01:06:44.438
Oh.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.598
Please, I really, really need this.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:49.008
You know I'm not good at decisions.

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:50.148
If this showing goes well,

01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:52.150
I'll finally be able to get out of here.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.666
Okay.

01:06:55.668 --> 01:06:57.036
Thank you.

01:06:57.038 --> 01:06:58.788
Come here, come here.

01:07:00.207 --> 01:07:01.583
You're so weird.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.558
Brutal honesty.

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.183
Like I'd do anything less.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:14.683
This one.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.423
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:24.063
It's beautiful.

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.470
It should be your signature piece.

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:31.843
I have another.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.130
- This is amazing.
- Oh no, no, no, no.

01:07:40.132 --> 01:07:41.328
Holy shit.

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:42.568
Mom went to bed early last night.

01:07:42.570 --> 01:07:43.768
I had a little extra energy.

01:07:43.770 --> 01:07:45.478
I have to put this in the showing.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.320
- No.
- Yes.

01:07:47.245 --> 01:07:48.468
- No.
- Yes.

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:51.003
No no, yours are so much better.

01:07:52.270 --> 01:07:53.288
I actually think that you might

01:07:53.290 --> 01:07:54.788
be able to make some money off this shit.

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:57.673
But it'll make a great
story if I sell yours.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.713
Wow.

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.440
Hey speaking of stories,
you still owe me one.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.390
My brain is barely functioning.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:09.813
Not today.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:15.623
All right, well another time.

01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:27.310
I'm proud of you, Lucas.

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:29.939
Thank you.

01:09:18.435 --> 01:09:20.502
- Is this everything?
- Not even close.

01:09:29.345 --> 01:09:31.318
For someone who wore the same thing

01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.818
every day, he sure had a lot of stuff.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:36.618
It's from all those
goddamn softball tournaments.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.593
My god, this closet is never-ending.

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:42.978
Yeah, he was like a full blown hoarder.

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:45.723
You should've had him on one
of those TV shows or something.

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:50.332
What are you gonna do with all this shit?

01:09:52.033 --> 01:09:55.283
I'm gonna donate most of it, you know?

01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:59.723
Keep one or two things for myself.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:01.700
So what about like

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.128
taxes or insurance,

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:08.393
you know financial stuff, got any ledgers?

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.698
He didn't go into those games,

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:12.213
now what I wouldn't give.

01:10:14.373 --> 01:10:18.838
- Remember that time in Arizona.
- What? Barely.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.693
I was like 14 or 15 or something.

01:10:26.748 --> 01:10:29.915
- You were so beautiful.
- What's that?

01:10:34.342 --> 01:10:37.092
The sunsets and the sunrises,
they were so beautiful.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.173
Yeah.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.033
I remember.

01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:55.733
Can you put this one over there?

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:57.753
- Yeah.
- Sure.

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:18.098
- Where are you going now?
- I have to work tonight.

01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:20.373
Work, is that what you call it?

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:25.040
We can't all be masters
of the universe like you.

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:32.598
You are a Davenport, I wish
you'd start acting like one.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.450
Well that's funny, I thought I was.

01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:39.618
Getting our name on another building,

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.073
that is the sort of thing
you're interested in, isn't it?

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:46.273
- Is this the gallery?
- What, you forgot?

01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:50.490
Not all business happens during the day.

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.308
Try to make sure whatever they

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:56.013
write about you this time is positive.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:07.133
You got it, pop.

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:45.288
Stop it, you're making me nervous.

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:47.958
Oh, you're nervous?

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.363
I'm freaking out here.

01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.573
Oh relax, look around.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.448
Everybody thinks your work is amazing.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.558
Says the sister who has way more talent.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.660
Ah, to the brother who's way too humble.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.768
Don't forget to throw a little

01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:12.388
humility my way when
you're rich and famous.

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:14.673
Once I'm out of this town, absolutely.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:29.053
Again.

01:13:30.885 --> 01:13:32.078
You okay?

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:32.913
Yeah.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.433
Aiden's here.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.093
Well, yeah.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:44.918
- He sort of owns the gallery.
- What?

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.524
I probably should have
told you but you seemed

01:13:47.526 --> 01:13:49.368
better lately, I didn't
think it would matter.

01:13:49.370 --> 01:13:50.683
What wouldn't matter?

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:52.813
Nothing.

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.823
- It's nothing, mom.
- What's wrong, honey?

01:14:02.339 --> 01:14:03.608
You know how she gets,

01:14:03.610 --> 01:14:06.183
she always needs to be
the center of attention.

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:09.308
It's getting late and I have

01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:11.638
a cab waiting out front for me, okay?

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:15.308
So I just want to tell
you how proud I am of you.

01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:17.791
Thanks mom, I'll see you in the morning.

01:14:17.793 --> 01:14:19.393
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:14:35.348 --> 01:14:36.928
So, what can I get you?

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:39.857
- Whatever.
- One whatever comin' up.

01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:44.758
All this time you knew about Aiden?

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.463
Yes, I knew, how could I not?

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:52.560
You never said anything.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.868
Neither did you, I figured you would

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.011
talk to me when you were
ready and you never did.

01:14:59.013 --> 01:15:02.298
- But you still stayed here.
- You think I wanted to?

01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:03.683
I had no choice.

01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:05.383
You left

01:15:07.510 --> 01:15:08.360
and dad got sick.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.983
I tried to leave, believe me.

01:15:14.021 --> 01:15:16.003
Hey, what's your name beautiful?

01:15:28.599 --> 01:15:29.432
I'm Tyler.

01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:35.228
- Better get another.
- Be right back.

01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:37.023
Hey, why don't you
let me buy you a drink?

01:15:38.029 --> 01:15:39.903
Just leave it, I'm not in the mood.

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:47.498
Have a drink with us,
it's Charlie's birthday.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.113
Come on, he's just turned 21.

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.133
Happy birthday, now fuck off.

01:15:58.890 --> 01:16:01.928
You know it's bad luck to
turn down a birthday drink.

01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:03.147
I said fuck off.

01:16:05.429 --> 01:16:06.786
Let's get out of here.

01:16:06.788 --> 01:16:08.038
Let's go to Manny's, it's
dollar drafts all night.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.228
No, I politely asked the
lady to have a drink with us.

01:16:11.230 --> 01:16:13.203
That's no way to treat the birthday boy.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.523
- You wanna have a drink?
- Yeah.

01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:18.443
Fine.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:20.760
Let's have a drink.

01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:41.423
So,

01:16:43.074 --> 01:16:46.260
- who wants to fuck first?
- What?

01:16:46.262 --> 01:16:48.182
That's what you wanted, right?

01:16:48.184 --> 01:16:50.431
A girl all alone in a bar,
she must be begging for it.

01:16:50.433 --> 01:16:51.798
No, that is not what I meant.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.798
Hell yeah it is.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.236
- Dude.
- Go for it, man.

01:16:54.238 --> 01:16:55.532
Cut it out, man.

01:16:55.534 --> 01:16:57.693
Are we doing this all
together or one at a time?

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.418
I'm guessing one at a time.

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:04.358
You're probably afraid of the whole

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:06.323
group thing being too gay, right?

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:13.028
Either way, let's get
it over with, I'm tired.

01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:14.818
This ain't right Nick,
let's just get outta here.

01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:16.728
Fuck you, I said I'd get you laid

01:17:16.730 --> 01:17:18.918
on your birthday, you're fucking doing it.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:21.898
Leave him alone, this chick's crazy.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.850
Crazy chick's the best type, come on.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.573
Fine,

01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:27.273
I'll go first.

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:32.493
- Alley or car?
- Lady's choice.

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.248
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.968
can I have your attention
please for just a moment?

01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:51.158
Welcome to the debut exhibition

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.053
of the fiercely talented Mr. Lucas Flynn.

01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:59.138
On behalf of the artist and the gallery,

01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.208
I'd like to say thank you
for coming this evening.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:02.728
As you can see, Mr. Flynn's work

01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:05.328
is as good if not better than advertised

01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:08.358
and you have the
privilege of first choice.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.528
So may I suggest that you
choose quickly but choose wisely

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:14.503
because these pieces will
not be at this price again.

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:16.830
Enjoy your evening.

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:20.223
Congratulations, my boy.

01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:25.438
I do honestly believe you
are going to be a big star.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.603
Thanks, Victor.

01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:29.958
I have to admit, when I arrived,

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.168
I was kind of disappointed
that I extended my stay.

01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:35.120
I thought that you might just be one of.

01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:41.348
- Aiden's pet projects.
- I don't understand.

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:46.350
Don't get offended, most of
your work is kind of mundane.

01:18:46.450 --> 01:18:50.323
It doesn't have the sprinkle
of magic all over it.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.008
However,

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:53.843
this one,

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.923
this one is masterful.

01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:05.223
It's

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:09.423
hauntingly beautiful.

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.473
You see?

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:15.880
I don't know what to say.

01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:23.358
Well this says it
all, so much potential.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.158
I mean you keep making things like this

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.338
and your star is going to be so bright.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:33.660
You have to believe me on
that one but to start I think

01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:37.513
this will help you celebrate this evening.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.688
You however should be
very glad that your dad

01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:47.653
bought you this place and
insisted on this one, bravo.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.030
Your father chose me?

01:19:53.190 --> 01:19:54.023
Yes.

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:57.073
A wise investment, don't you think?

01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:02.830
Good work, my friend.

01:20:06.325 --> 01:20:07.158
Good work.

01:20:13.779 --> 01:20:15.933
You wanna hear a story?

01:20:15.935 --> 01:20:17.768
I'll tell you a story.

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:21.343
Once upon a time, there was a girl

01:20:23.226 --> 01:20:24.576
and she had a perfect life.

01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:26.963
Friends,

01:20:29.437 --> 01:20:30.270
a family,

01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.440
everything you could ever ask for.

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:38.593
Then one night,

01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:42.190
everything changed.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.113
She had a crush on a boy,
so she was very excited.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:54.330
Especially when they were alone together.

01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:01.873
The girl was naive.

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:07.090
A first kiss was all she wanted.

01:21:12.187 --> 01:21:14.482
She got a lot more.

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:25.833
Please don't.

01:21:43.313 --> 01:21:47.880
She never said a word because
her daddy told her not to.

01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:55.478
Good enough story for you?

01:21:57.671 --> 01:21:58.838
How could you?

01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:21.200
No, there was no happy ending.

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:23.369
But you already knew that.

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:49.383
Did he have
a history of drug use?

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:57.247
Lucas, Lucas, no no
no, come back to mommy.

01:22:57.249 --> 01:23:00.916
Come back here, no baby,
you can't leave me.

01:23:02.842 --> 01:23:03.675
No, no!

01:23:07.001 --> 01:23:08.251
Yeah but he...

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:12.650
Was he under medical
treatment or was he recovering?

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.018
It's possible that an addict

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:17.920
in recovery can overdose accidentally.

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.978
Besides if it were a suicide,

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:23.030
the subject would typically leave a note.

01:23:31.974 --> 01:23:33.368
Do something!

01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:34.373
No, nothing.

01:23:40.037 --> 01:23:41.787
Do something, Kira.

01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.963
Help my baby.

01:23:48.838 --> 01:23:49.671
Kira!

01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:11.723
If you can think of anything,
please give us a call.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:14.380
Even the smallest detail can help.

01:24:29.443 --> 01:24:31.026
Detective Henson.

01:24:37.630 --> 01:24:40.218
My brother, he wasn't exactly

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.573
what you'd call a happy person.

01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.138
I know, I met Lucas about six

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.090
months ago when I first transferred in.

01:24:49.599 --> 01:24:51.238
Well,

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:54.738
I think he was just
overwhelmed by everything

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:57.713
and he thought this was his only way out.

01:24:59.270 --> 01:25:00.783
What do you mean by everything?

01:25:04.248 --> 01:25:06.080
Is there something you know that can help?

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:12.380
I know a lot of things, I
just don't know if I can help.

01:25:17.021 --> 01:25:19.021
Well when you do know, give me a call.

01:25:47.724 --> 01:25:48.807
Mom.

01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:52.362
I know you're gonna try to
find some way to blame...

01:25:53.197 --> 01:25:54.718
I don't wanna hear your voice anymore.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.820
You're goddamn right I blame you for this.

01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:59.490
Your brother was fine,

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:03.468
I was fine, we were fine

01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:04.303
for years

01:26:06.192 --> 01:26:07.403
and then you come home.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.483
Now I have to bury a son
along with my husband.

01:26:20.466 --> 01:26:22.763
- You don't know, do you?
- About what?

01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:27.648
What, that you had a horrible life?

01:26:27.650 --> 01:26:29.363
That I'm a terrible mother?

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.023
Of course I know, I know
every time you look at me.

01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:39.953
You don't know that I was raped.

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:46.510
What are you talking about?

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:51.440
When I was 15, by Aiden Davenport

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:54.729
and daddy knew all about it.

01:26:54.731 --> 01:26:57.078
You take that back,
your father would never...

01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.339
My father knew everything and he took

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:02.753
the Davenport's money
to keep his mouth shut.

01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:08.538
Why would you say such a thing?

01:27:08.540 --> 01:27:10.278
Oh god, how do you think

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.683
we could afford this house
and all these things?

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:16.023
Daddy was a fucking alcoholic.

01:27:18.576 --> 01:27:21.476
He did the best that he
could, he did the best he could.

01:27:23.290 --> 01:27:24.123
Come on.

01:27:25.138 --> 01:27:25.971
Mom.

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.408
He couldn't keep a job
for more than six months.

01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:32.358
He took the Davenport's money just like

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.837
everybody else in this town,
he was bought and paid for.

01:27:34.839 --> 01:27:35.922
No, no, no.

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.151
- No, no.
- Yes.

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:42.548
And no matter how much I cried
while it happened or after

01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:46.083
or how many fucking nightmares
I had, nobody helped me!

01:27:46.954 --> 01:27:49.202
Not daddy,

01:27:49.204 --> 01:27:50.037
not you

01:27:51.130 --> 01:27:52.427
and not Lucas.

01:27:59.282 --> 01:28:00.468
Lucas?

01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:01.303
Yeah.

01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:04.370
Poor, sweet Lucas.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.193
He knew

01:28:09.904 --> 01:28:12.943
and he lived a lie too,
just to keep you happy.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.037
That's enough.

01:28:19.937 --> 01:28:21.294
A lot of good it did him.

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:22.817
I said that's enough!

01:28:29.610 --> 01:28:30.443
I want you

01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:33.143
out of this house.

01:28:35.874 --> 01:28:39.873
So do I, mom, and as much
I would love to leave...

01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.310
Now we will get things
done, you will pack your bags

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:51.933
and I don't ever want
to see you again, ever.

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:54.293
What?

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.620
Richard was right,

01:28:58.610 --> 01:29:00.983
you poison everything you touch.

01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:18.978
- Hello?
- Hey Kira,

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:21.393
it's Deana from Dr. Shaw's office.

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:25.248
I was just reading the paper

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:29.803
and I am so sorry to
hear about your brother.

01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:33.090
This really isn't a good time.

01:30:33.980 --> 01:30:35.538
I know.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:38.520
Listen if there's
anything you need, even if

01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:44.057
it means finding you a new
doctor, I can help with that.

01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:48.563
I appreciate that.

01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.173
I'm so sorry.

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:05.147
Jesus Christ.

01:33:07.691 --> 01:33:09.391
Why can't you just leave me alone?

01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:22.423
I don't know

01:33:24.519 --> 01:33:25.970
what to say, I...

01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:33.243
Don't touch me.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.050
He was my friend and...

01:33:46.925 --> 01:33:50.748
You can see where I'd find
that difficult to believe.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:51.583
It's true.

01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:56.513
I just, I don't understand why,

01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:58.690
why would he...

01:34:02.471 --> 01:34:05.073
- We were just beginning, we...
- Just stop talking.

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:14.830
I've got a...

01:34:24.630 --> 01:34:25.530
I really am sorry.

01:34:43.674 --> 01:34:44.968
It's about time you got home.

01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:47.020
We're gonna be late, where have you been?

01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:49.433
Lucas' wake.

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:52.173
Was that today?

01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:54.603
Yes, it was.

01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:59.903
He's dead, do you remember that?

01:35:02.049 --> 01:35:03.518
A shame.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.738
Go get dressed, the car's in front.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.053
Yeah, I'm not going.

01:35:09.221 --> 01:35:10.808
I'm not really feeling up for it.

01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:13.868
Don't be ridiculous, the
whole town will be there.

01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:16.308
You know what this means for both of us.

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.543
- For you.
- Excuse me?

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.630
You said how much it means for us but

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.408
what you really mean is
how much it means for you.

01:35:25.410 --> 01:35:28.263
- It's the same thing.
- No, it's not.

01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:31.700
It doesn't mean that much to me at all.

01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.050
Mother would have been there today.

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:44.953
Aiden.

01:35:47.424 --> 01:35:48.257
Aiden.

01:37:30.643 --> 01:37:33.735
Thank you so much, please.

01:37:33.737 --> 01:37:35.688
What a delightful crowd, we're
so happy that you came out

01:37:35.690 --> 01:37:39.608
tonight as we honor our Man of
the Year, Richard Davenport.

01:37:39.610 --> 01:37:41.458
It's a wonderful event and of all

01:37:41.460 --> 01:37:44.060
the events I've done, it's
actually the most recent.

01:37:45.650 --> 01:37:47.108
I'll work on that joke, Richard.

01:37:47.110 --> 01:37:51.403
Seriously I just want to say
that tonight we honor this man.

01:37:52.290 --> 01:37:54.608
This town has been a beacon
of hope and prosperity

01:37:54.610 --> 01:37:59.398
throughout the years and one
man took it upon his back

01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:02.358
to take us through some
very, very tough times

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.238
and that is the man that we honor tonight.

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:06.078
Our first ever Man of the Year.

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.891
A big hand please for Richard Davenport.

01:38:16.525 --> 01:38:17.589
Thank you.

01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:19.718
Thank you Mayor Winston and Rob,

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.620
don't worry, the check is in the mail.

01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:27.667
Seriously I'm very happy and very honored

01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:31.363
to be here tonight and
to see all of you here.

01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:35.608
I first came to Bridgewood
over 50 years ago

01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:40.610
as a young boy and I was
raised here very happily.

01:38:41.730 --> 01:38:46.308
I met my beloved wife Ava
here and together we built

01:38:46.310 --> 01:38:48.958
a happy life, a life that
we were very proud of

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:52.208
and although Ava is no
longer with me, I plan to

01:38:52.210 --> 01:38:56.088
build the rest of my future
right here in our town.

01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:58.218
Don't you mean your town?

01:38:58.220 --> 01:38:59.398
Excuse me?

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.313
It's not our town.

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:06.803
It's your town.

01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:10.250
You own all the businesses
and most of the people.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:12.828
Ah,

01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:13.753
Kira Flynn.

01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.008
Well yes,

01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:19.043
yes Kira,

01:39:19.982 --> 01:39:21.398
I have to say that

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:25.528
I have made some perspicacious
investments fortunately

01:39:25.530 --> 01:39:29.578
and yes, I do have a significant
stake in what happens here.

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:30.411
Nothing happens here

01:39:30.413 --> 01:39:32.355
- without your say.
- I think that...

01:39:32.357 --> 01:39:33.468
- Get the fuck off me.
- What we have built here...

01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:36.348
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Is something very special.

01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:38.678
And I don't think we should let anything

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:42.148
or anyone take it away from us.

01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:44.468
I think we should protect our future

01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:48.416
and continue to deliver on the
promise of a better tomorrow.

01:39:53.223 --> 01:39:56.408
Get your fucking hands off me.

01:39:56.410 --> 01:39:57.243
I got it!

01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.938
I'd like you all to forgive Kira here.

01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.848
As many of you know, the
Flynn family has been

01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:06.268
through a very difficult
time and we should all

01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:09.620
give them our support
in their hour of need.

01:40:27.301 --> 01:40:31.301
- Hey Devon, have you...
- Oh, look who showed up.

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:35.008
Hey Brianne, have you seen...

01:40:35.010 --> 01:40:36.218
Fuck.

01:40:36.220 --> 01:40:37.998
- Fucking bitch.
- What the hell was that for?

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.008
For fucking Darren.

01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:41.923
What, you didn't think I'd find out?

01:40:43.002 --> 01:40:46.348
- You are a fucking whore.
- Right.

01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:50.598
I'm sorry about that, I
didn't mean anything by it.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.038
Yeah yeah, sure I
know, you can't help it.

01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.443
Your legs just spread open by
themselves, they always have.

01:40:59.361 --> 01:41:00.461
Have you seen Aiden?

01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:06.568
Why, do you wanna fuck him
too, for old time's sake?

01:41:06.570 --> 01:41:09.673
He hasn't been in,
maybe try his apartment.

01:41:11.170 --> 01:41:13.493
- Got an address.
- No.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:16.720
Lucas would've known.

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.720
Lucas always wanted to fuck him too.

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.270
You better talk to your daughter.

01:41:43.131 --> 01:41:44.188
That big fuckin' mouth of hers

01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:46.040
is gonna get her in a lot of trouble.

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:49.913
Is it true?

01:41:51.490 --> 01:41:52.323
What?

01:41:56.190 --> 01:41:57.290
Is it true?

01:41:58.310 --> 01:42:01.098
I expected that
question a long time ago.

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.818
Then you shouldn't have
any problems answering it.

01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:06.268
Look at your life, Sheila.

01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:09.488
George didn't give you all of this, I did.

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:10.618
What?

01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.228
The man couldn't stay sober long enough

01:42:12.230 --> 01:42:15.628
to take care of himself,
let alone a family.

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:16.588
Kira was just a girl.

01:42:16.590 --> 01:42:19.378
Don't give me your
melodramatic bullshit.

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:21.348
What happened between them
was a misunderstanding.

01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:23.988
Is that what you call
it, a misunderstanding?

01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:27.328
A lapse in judgment,
Aiden was a kid too.

01:42:27.330 --> 01:42:29.468
Mistakes happen.

01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:31.038
You've been fairly compensated.

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:34.088
If it wasn't for me you'd have
been on the street years ago.

01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:35.340
I'm calling the police.

01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:38.113
Don't be ridiculous.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.288
That was,

01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:43.198
that was 15 years ago,
no one would believe you.

01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.398
- You'll lose everything.
- I already have.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.838
I'm not doing this for myself,
I'm doing this for Kira

01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:53.358
and Lucas and everyone
else's life you have ruined.

01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.018
I want people to know who you are.

01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:57.061
Don't you do this, Sheila.

01:42:57.063 --> 01:42:59.310
- Get out of my house.
- Your house?

01:42:59.312 --> 01:43:01.607
- Get out of my house!
- Your house?

01:43:01.609 --> 01:43:04.701
It's my house, I paid for it!

01:43:04.703 --> 01:43:07.092
It's my fuckin' house!

01:43:12.281 --> 01:43:13.685
Hey!

01:43:59.838 --> 01:44:00.671
Go.

01:44:01.573 --> 01:44:03.118
Go.

01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:07.370
He's not gonna hurt us
anymore, you better go, now.

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:19.603
You gotta go.

01:44:19.605 --> 01:44:20.438
Now.

01:45:14.771 --> 01:45:18.190
Please help me, I've been attacked.

01:45:18.192 --> 01:45:23.192
Can you please hurry?

01:45:37.458 --> 01:45:38.458
It's open.

01:45:43.224 --> 01:45:45.893
Kira.

01:45:45.895 --> 01:45:48.145
I didn't expect to see you.

01:45:49.036 --> 01:45:52.269
I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.

01:45:52.271 --> 01:45:54.271
- You want a drink?
- No.

01:45:56.911 --> 01:45:58.494
What do you want?

01:46:01.177 --> 01:46:03.344
I want you to punish me.

01:47:01.022 --> 01:47:05.448
You wanna play rough, huh?

01:47:05.450 --> 01:47:06.283
Oh yeah.

01:47:09.013 --> 01:47:11.763
- Easy.
- That was too hard for you?

01:47:21.739 --> 01:47:24.737
Oh fuck.

01:47:24.739 --> 01:47:27.108
Hey Kira, what the fuck are you doing?

01:47:27.110 --> 01:47:28.658
- Don't move.
- Kira.

01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:29.853
Don't move.

01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:32.878
What the fuck are you doing?

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:35.793
- I'm ending this.
- Ending what?

01:47:37.114 --> 01:47:39.918
What you did to me and Lucas.

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.913
I tried to help Lucas, Kira.

01:47:42.974 --> 01:47:46.248
- You know what you did.
- Kira,

01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:47.218
put the fucking knife down,

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:49.020
Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you?

01:47:50.756 --> 01:47:52.448
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:47:52.450 --> 01:47:54.328
- All of a sudden you're crazy.
- Oh, your daddy.

01:47:54.330 --> 01:47:56.402
You're out of your
fucking mind, aren't you?

01:47:56.404 --> 01:47:59.903
He always cleans up your
messes, Aiden, wasn't that nice?

01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.598
Kira,

01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:05.198
- please put the knife down.
- Why?

01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:08.211
- So you can be in control?
- No.

01:48:08.213 --> 01:48:10.138
I don't want anybody to get hurt.

01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:12.151
You care about me now?

01:48:12.153 --> 01:48:14.847
Like you cared about me in high school?

01:48:14.849 --> 01:48:16.300
High school, what the fuck are

01:48:16.302 --> 01:48:17.908
you talking about, high school, what?

01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:19.893
We were together, it was fun.

01:48:21.398 --> 01:48:23.098
You thought that was fun for me?

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.833
I never heard any complaints.

01:48:30.615 --> 01:48:32.098
Mr. Davenport.

01:48:32.100 --> 01:48:34.588
It's Detective Henson, is everything okay?

01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:36.613
- You called the fuckin' cops?
- Yes.

01:48:41.009 --> 01:48:44.932
- You called the fuckin' cops?
- Mr. Davenport.

01:48:44.934 --> 01:48:46.101
Mr. Davenport.

01:48:47.371 --> 01:48:48.256
Get 'em outta here.

01:48:48.258 --> 01:48:50.459
Get the fuckin' cops outta here, no no.

01:48:51.705 --> 01:48:53.062
Get the fuck down.

01:48:53.064 --> 01:48:54.175
Drop it, get down on the ground.

01:48:54.177 --> 01:48:55.677
No no no, no no.

01:48:56.520 --> 01:48:58.103
Ah fuck, goddammit.

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:08.083
Deana, do you have an update
on the status of Kira Flynn?

01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:10.380
No sir.

01:50:11.970 --> 01:50:14.838
All right, I'll be in
session for the next hour with

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:18.263
Amanda and I know you'll see
to it that we're not disturbed.

01:50:34.541 --> 01:50:35.374
Hello?

01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:37.623
Oh hi.

01:50:40.380 --> 01:50:41.393
I'm glad you called.

01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.600
Tell Dr. Shaw that I'm gonna
come see him very soon.

01:50:48.776 --> 01:50:49.609
Thanks.
