-Up or down?
-Up.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.037
-You sure?
-We'll be late. yes.

05:30.039 --> 05:31.121
All right.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.916
-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.045
And I'm a little bit worried
you're gonna upstage the groom
looking so handsome.

05:38.589 --> 05:39.713
Yeah, whatever.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.215
How's your toast coming?

05:42.926 --> 05:45.093
-It's coming along.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.595
It's been kind of hard
focusing.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.474
Just can't stop thinking
about Randolph

05:50.517 --> 05:53.393
-and what he said
about the Landrys.
-I know.

05:53.395 --> 05:56.104
I mean, I lost my farm
because I couldn't
pay my loan.

05:56.607 --> 05:57.606
We got desperate.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.441
But Landry gets a pass.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.693
I mean, that ain't right.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.529
-[sighs]
-Well, that's a problem
for tomorrow.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.908
Right now,
we just need to be there
for Prosper and Sandy.

06:07.984 --> 06:11.328
[chuckles softly] You know,
our wedding day's in
the top five days of my life.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.497
-Hmm.
-For real.

06:14.917 --> 06:18.126
I bet I can guess
the top five.

06:18.504 --> 06:20.670
-All five?
-All five.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.297
-I don't think so
but come on.
-Okay.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.509
-Blue's birth.
-That's one.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.345
-Tru's birth.
-That's two.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.055
Our wedding.

06:31.725 --> 06:32.808
The day you got out.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.226
That's four.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.603
What's five?

06:37.314 --> 06:38.605
Hasn't happened yet.

06:39.650 --> 06:42.818

is still yet to come.

in your house,

and I saw you,
something changed

and that knockout smile,

you smiling for the rest
of my life.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.947
I don't think I get lost
this time.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.033
I love to hear that.

13:06.745 --> 13:07.827
You're healing.

13:10.373 --> 13:11.539
We both are.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.920
I'm so glad you came back
to St. Jo.

13:16.922 --> 13:20.590
-You always had a way
of shaking this place up.
-[laughing]

13:20.592 --> 13:21.749
Girl, you know
you shake the tree,

13:21.751 --> 13:23.676
you never know
what's gonna fall out.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.429
Old relationships
and new adventures.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.349
On that note,
I'm gonna need a drink.

13:29.425 --> 13:32.018
Girl, old relationships.
Don't get me started.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.645
[both laughing]

13:33.721 --> 13:36.523
["Back To Life" playing]

13:36.525 --> 13:38.691
Mind if I take this onto
the dance floor?

13:38.693 --> 13:39.776
-Me?
-You.

13:39.820 --> 13:40.944
She's talking about me.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.031
I would love that. Come on.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.702
<i> ♪ Tell me maybe I ♪</i>

13:49.704 --> 13:52.497
<i> ♪ Could be there for you ♪</i>

13:54.292 --> 13:55.750
<i> ♪ How ever do you want me ♪</i>

13:55.752 --> 13:56.751
[Nova] Can't keep up!

13:56.828 --> 13:57.894
Hey!

13:59.130 --> 14:01.339
<i> ♪ How ever do you want me ♪</i>

14:01.416 --> 14:03.007
It's nice to see
you still got it, sis.

14:03.084 --> 14:04.843
Oh, was it even a question?

14:04.919 --> 14:07.595
I mean, you ain't exactly
a spring chicken,
you know what I'm saying?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.640
Oh! It's giving jealousy.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.350
Well, you know,
I'll always have
more moves than you.

14:12.427 --> 14:14.243
-Stop playin'.
-[Ralph] You don't want
the smoke, no.

14:14.245 --> 14:15.353
-No, but don't make me...
-[Nova] And you come on now,
stop playin'.

14:15.430 --> 14:16.670
come up out this suit jacket.
I'll... I'll...

14:16.748 --> 14:17.856
-[Nova] What you gonna...
-I'll break it down...

14:17.858 --> 14:20.859
Break... you don't...
hey... you... ay!

14:22.696 --> 14:24.320
Come here. I gotta
give you something.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.906
I'll be right back.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.683
What's up?

14:31.246 --> 14:33.746
Violet talked to me
about the movie,

14:33.823 --> 14:36.374
and how she feels about it now

14:36.376 --> 14:37.792
moving forward with it.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.127
She talked to me too.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.921
Well, I wanna check in.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.047
How do you feel about it?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.427
I feel like it's messy.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.096
But knowing our story...

14:50.173 --> 14:51.222
...talking about it...

14:52.142 --> 14:53.141
...it helped.

14:53.935 --> 14:55.226
So, if it helps somebody else,

14:56.271 --> 14:57.562
I ain't mad at it.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.191
Well, it can keep
helping us, too.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.617
Wait, you serious?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.704
-Stop playin', for real?
-This is the advance.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.416
He said, "However you need,

15:19.294 --> 15:20.627
try and get the land back."

15:26.593 --> 15:27.592
Come here.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.220
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

15:33.767 --> 15:34.933
Ralph Angel...

15:35.977 --> 15:36.935
You smell that?

15:39.022 --> 15:40.605
It smell like cane burning.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.107
It's the wrong time of year
for that.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.405
Somebody's cane on fire!

15:50.241 --> 15:51.699
That's Landry's land!

15:59.876 --> 16:02.085
[Ralph] Thank God
it was controlled.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.045
Nobody burns cane
around this time of year.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.713
It definitely wasn't
no accident.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.215
Now, that fire
was started on...

16:07.550 --> 16:09.192
...Landry's side
of the property.

16:09.194 --> 16:11.094
But why would the Landrys
start a fire
on their own land?

16:11.096 --> 16:12.887
He damaged his crops
more than ours.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.722
It must be some kind
of strategy, right?

16:14.724 --> 16:15.974
[Darla] He's getting out.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.517
He's selling his mills
for parts.

16:17.593 --> 16:19.560
We've seen construction
markers across his land.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.480
Well, Mo told us they tried
this tactic upstate
with another co-op.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.440
Intimidation and sabotage.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.693
Vince has handled
cases like this before.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.486
I'll call him,
see if he can come down.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.822
There's gotta be something
on those files
Randolph copied.

16:30.898 --> 16:32.699
And it's bigger than
some files that over...

16:32.775 --> 16:35.618
Fire's out,
and nobody got hurt,
thank God.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.744
Aunt Vi,
we gotta do something.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.538
I know, baby.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.916
But I am not about to let
Sam Landry or anything

16:41.918 --> 16:44.210
rob us of the glory
of this day.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.172
So, go get cleaned up
as best you can,

16:48.249 --> 16:50.008
and come on back to the party.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.177
Prosper, you have...

16:53.179 --> 16:57.306
...one of the most beautiful
brides I have ever seen
in my life.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.183
[whispering] Thank you.

16:59.185 --> 17:04.230
And she is eager to cut
into the most delicious cake
I've ever baked!

17:04.232 --> 17:07.942
We are not about to let
all that go to waste.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.110
I second that.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.821
You're right, I don't wanna...

17:12.365 --> 17:13.197
...ruin her day.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.657
She doesn't deserve that.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.703
Come on folks.
Let's enjoy ourselves.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.787
[all agreeing]

17:19.789 --> 17:21.497
[guests chattering]

17:24.419 --> 17:25.710
[Hollywood] How is it, baby?

17:28.465 --> 17:31.841
Ladies and gentlemen,
family and friends,

17:31.843 --> 17:34.802
let's give another round
of applause for Mr. Prosper
and Ms. Sandy.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.138
[all cheering]

17:39.059 --> 17:41.100
[Micah] Yo, it's been a day,
but we still here.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.268
We still shining, right?

17:42.345 --> 17:43.786
[all agreeing]

17:43.788 --> 17:45.855
My Aunt Vi is about
to unveil her latest creation,

17:45.857 --> 17:48.691
and she said, and I quote,

17:48.693 --> 17:51.986
"Baby, y'all ain't never
had nothing like this."

17:52.021 --> 17:54.947
So, without further ado,

17:55.024 --> 17:58.910
let's make some noise
for the Denton Dreamy Delight
wedding cake!

17:58.912 --> 18:00.161
[all murmuring excitedly]

18:00.163 --> 18:01.487
[Micah] Make some noise!

18:01.489 --> 18:05.249
Y'all ain't never tasted
nothing like this before!

18:08.421 --> 18:10.112
[excitedly] Ah!

18:10.114 --> 18:13.299
-Thank you, Vi. Thank you.
-[Violet] You're
welcome, baby.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.552
-You ready?
-Yes.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.638
[man] Careful
with that knife, now!

18:18.640 --> 18:20.640
[all laughing]

18:27.065 --> 18:28.731
[woman] Get it, girl! Get it!

18:29.442 --> 18:31.400
[all laughing and cheering]

18:41.871 --> 18:43.663
St. Jo came through...

18:43.739 --> 18:45.331
-Oh, wow!
-Everyone was showing out.

18:45.408 --> 18:47.125
And I just wanted
to capture the love.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.043
[Keke] I can feel it.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.419
These are amazing.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.796
[Micah] Thanks,
it was a good time.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.307
Hey, can I ask you something?

19:04.102 --> 19:05.101
Shoot.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.313
Why did you break up with me?

19:11.693 --> 19:15.194
I feel like I never got
a clear... answer.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.614
It wasn't one reason.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.118
We were growing apart.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.328
It seemed that we were on
two different paths.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.330
We were really young.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.208
New people, new ideas and...

19:32.255 --> 19:36.424
To be honest,
it wasn't always easy
being Micah West's girlfriend.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.633
Really?

19:38.469 --> 19:40.845
Why didn't you tell me that?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.597
It wasn't a big deal
in St. Jo,

19:42.599 --> 19:44.307
because everyone
knew me first.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.769
But here, when I tell
people about you,

19:48.771 --> 19:49.937
they look at me like...

19:52.650 --> 19:54.775
Like, "Why is he with her?"

19:55.695 --> 19:57.028
She's so country.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.949
I felt the jealousy...

20:03.244 --> 20:04.410
...and the judgement.

20:07.999 --> 20:08.956
It sucked.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.046
It's wild to me that...

20:15.048 --> 20:18.758
...people would say that,
because from the minute
I laid eyes on you,

20:18.834 --> 20:20.426
I felt like you were
out of my league.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.805
You're beautiful.

20:28.686 --> 20:29.727
[sighing]

20:31.481 --> 20:32.730
Thank you for saying that.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.108
I feel that.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.612
You know, it's taken me

20:39.614 --> 20:42.406
some time to understand
that St. Jo...

20:42.408 --> 20:45.910
...is a special place
that I carry with me.

20:45.987 --> 20:49.205
Not something I should
be ashamed of or run from
or hide.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.792
I wanted to make my own way,

20:52.868 --> 20:57.505
and with all of our
other issues, I felt...

20:57.507 --> 21:01.092
...that I would always
be Micah West's girlfriend
if I didn't break away.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.847
But I could've handled it
way better.

21:08.393 --> 21:09.308
And I'm sorry.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.436
[quietly] I understand.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.780
So, if we can prove
that the fire was intentional,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.156
we can take the Landrys
to court.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.200
This precedent that can
be a great guide.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.160
This isn't the first time
this type of tactic

21:28.237 --> 21:29.328
has been tried
in rural communities.

21:29.405 --> 21:30.846
Billie's right.

21:30.848 --> 21:33.666
We've done it before,
so if we can find a pattern

21:33.743 --> 21:37.003
of intimidation, preferential
treatment, corruption,

21:37.297 --> 21:38.612
we can build a case.

21:38.689 --> 21:40.506
We can look to the files
that Randolph gave.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.300
I started analyzing them
last night.

21:42.302 --> 21:45.469
Look, all that sound cool,
but I still wanna talk
to Landry.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.862
That could be tricky.

21:46.864 --> 21:47.972
I mean, what's the intent
of going and doing that?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.640
To confront him,
look him in the face

21:49.642 --> 21:51.475
and see if he got
that stupid smirk on it.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.644
That's when I know he's lying.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.062
Look, all I'm saying,
maybe a face-to-face

21:55.064 --> 21:56.689
might help us know
if we on track.

21:56.691 --> 21:59.066
Yeah, but Ra,
he's got bad blood for you.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.444
And you for him, I mean,
I just don't think it's wise

22:01.446 --> 22:03.029
for you to put yourself
in a position

22:03.105 --> 22:06.073
where he could potentially
twist it to his advantage.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.118
Exactly, you'd be making
it easy for him to say
that you're trying

22:09.162 --> 22:11.037
to intimidate or coerce him.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.123
I'll go.

22:14.167 --> 22:16.709
He won't expect anything
coming from me.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.294
I'll see if I can get
anything out of him.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.344
[woman] Mr. Landry
will see you now.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.349
Ms. Bordelon.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.726
What a wonderful surprise.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.428
To what do I owe
this pleasure?

22:36.505 --> 22:39.190
I came to inquire about a fire
on one of your
properties last night.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.192
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:41.194 --> 22:43.611
You're not aware
of a controlled burn
on one of your properties?

22:43.613 --> 22:47.031
I don't run the day-to-day
on my lands.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.493
-Respectfully, I have people
who do that.
-[Darla] Do you?

22:50.495 --> 22:54.121
I've heard you've been forced
to greatly reduce
your staff and assets.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.874
Well, you heard wrong.

22:56.951 --> 22:58.376
You seem very defensive
all of a sudden.

22:58.378 --> 22:59.251
Are you okay?

22:59.328 --> 23:01.212
Of course I'm okay.

23:02.465 --> 23:05.007
We've had a lot of lightning
strikes in the last few years.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.301
Who knows?

23:08.429 --> 23:10.596
Maybe climate change is real.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.966
Why does this even
matter to you?

23:14.042 --> 23:17.061
Because the land that burned
is very close to land
that's important to me,

23:17.063 --> 23:18.813
and no more protocols
have been followed.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.941
Your little farmer's club.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.823
I almost feel sorry for you.

23:30.368 --> 23:32.451
You're hiding so many secrets.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.497
It's gonna poison you
from the inside out.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.631
How dare you
try to talk to me...

23:46.008 --> 23:46.907
...like we're familiar.

23:46.909 --> 23:48.426
I'm not trying to talk to you.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.846
I am talking to you,
and very directly, in fact.

23:56.894 --> 23:59.854
[Sam] You know,
it doesn't matter.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.148
Whatever you thought
you were doing,

24:02.150 --> 24:04.150
or getting by coming here...

24:07.113 --> 24:09.738
We finalize our deal
with the outlet mall tomorrow,

24:09.782 --> 24:11.824
and then you...

24:11.826 --> 24:16.412
...and your clan,
can make their lives
miserable for all I care.

24:17.248 --> 24:20.624
People underestimate us,
Mr. Landry.

24:22.462 --> 24:23.944
Just know...

24:25.214 --> 24:28.257
...that when everything
comes crashing down for you,

24:29.719 --> 24:33.262
and we both know that
that's happening sooner
than later,

24:33.264 --> 24:34.722
you'll have brought
your misery...

24:36.100 --> 24:37.224
...on yourself.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.627
Have a good day.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.902
[Violet] That reckless burn
was one thing too much.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.655
I am through with
those damn Landrys.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.398
Now, I don't know,

24:53.475 --> 24:56.118
whether or not
that Betty's land
had anything to do with this.

24:56.120 --> 24:59.038
But she would stop it
if she could.

24:59.114 --> 25:02.166
Baby, I'm not even sure
if it's her current address.

25:02.243 --> 25:04.126
It's just the last one
I found in Seattle.

25:04.128 --> 25:06.086
Yeah, well, I just can't
sit around

25:06.088 --> 25:09.423
and let Sam Landry
destroy my family
and my community.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.133
Well...

25:11.135 --> 25:13.427
...my bags are in the car.
I'm ready to go.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.264
You are?

25:18.059 --> 25:19.016
Woman...

25:19.769 --> 25:21.560
You know who I am.

25:33.741 --> 25:36.659
-Hey...
-Vince, we are working.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.536
Now, if you're opening
your mouth to flirt with me,

25:38.612 --> 25:40.287
and not because you found
something that I'm after...

25:40.289 --> 25:42.289
You'll do what, huh?

25:42.291 --> 25:44.250
You gonna smack my hand
with the deposition?

25:44.252 --> 25:46.377
You know, you were lethal
with those things
in law school.

25:46.379 --> 25:48.712
Well, it was the only thing
that could keep your focus.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.006
And I make no apologies.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.134
Well... you shouldn't.

25:54.136 --> 25:56.470
Because I was so busy
looking at you,

25:56.472 --> 25:59.181
I don't know that I would have
made it through law school
if you didn't.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.100
Okay, see, this is
what I'm talking about.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.385
You were flirting.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.020
-I wouldn't
call that flirting.
-Yeah, I, uh...

26:05.022 --> 26:07.231
-Just telling you that...
-[laughing]

26:08.693 --> 26:10.234
...I was lucky
to have you there.

26:11.362 --> 26:15.239
And not just because
I was crazy about you.

26:15.316 --> 26:18.701
But for the many times
you stayed up half the night
to save my ass.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.413
Well, you're welcome.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.624
You ever think about
going back?

26:25.626 --> 26:27.960
[sighs] I think about it
all the time.

26:29.297 --> 26:30.737
Well...

26:32.508 --> 26:35.843
...I could, uh, help you prep
for the LSATs again.

26:35.845 --> 26:37.303
[both laughing]

26:38.723 --> 26:40.889
-Yes, the LSATs.
-[laughing]

26:40.891 --> 26:42.224
So, um...

26:42.893 --> 26:47.396
...the night before
the LSATs was...

26:48.482 --> 26:51.483
...the day that our whole life
changed.

26:51.560 --> 26:55.404
[laughing] Mmm-hmm.
Yes, it did.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.339
Yes, it did.

26:58.367 --> 27:02.369
And we got a beautiful son
out of it, a genius,
just like his mother.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.455
You always had a better mind
for this than me.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.335
I missed you.

27:12.173 --> 27:14.340
Especially when I thought
I was gonna lose you.

27:15.593 --> 27:16.800
I'm here.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.511
I know.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.860
[Vince chuckling]

27:39.533 --> 27:41.116
[pen clicking]

27:45.873 --> 27:48.332
[sighing]

27:48.409 --> 27:50.501
I've been wanting to tell you
that I'm working on
something new.

27:50.577 --> 27:54.713
-Hmm.
-Um, I'm writing about
the loves of my life.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.006
-Ohh!
-Yeah. [laughing]

27:56.008 --> 27:57.508
Very interesting.

27:57.584 --> 27:59.134
-[laughing]
-How many are there?

27:59.136 --> 28:00.302
Well...

28:01.639 --> 28:03.222
...one of them is right here.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.765
-Oh, really?
-Oh, really.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.936
[Nova] Hmm.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.817
So much has happened
since you've been away.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.695
I don't know where to begin.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.530
Um...

28:21.117 --> 28:25.411
I saw my first love
from high school.

28:25.487 --> 28:30.708
And I, uh, was so afraid
to see her, 'cause I wasn't
sure where it would lead.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.960
I mean, I'm actually
writing about that now.

28:33.036 --> 28:34.527
Oh, can I read?

28:34.529 --> 28:37.715
Yeah, uh, no. It's... No.
It's not [laughing] there yet.

28:37.717 --> 28:42.970
I mean, I don't even know
what it is. If it's a book
or an essay or just for me,

28:42.972 --> 28:46.432
but, um, I'll show you
when it's ready.

28:46.434 --> 28:47.891
Before I show anyone else.

28:49.145 --> 28:50.144
Promise.

28:50.563 --> 28:51.687
[laughing]

28:52.314 --> 28:53.522
Who else is in there?

28:55.651 --> 28:58.652
All of them. Uh...

28:58.729 --> 29:03.031
...I mean, this whole process
has had me reflecting
on so much.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.891
Including us.

29:06.495 --> 29:10.748
I mean, my relationships
have always had one foot
out the door.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.792
And I've always fallen
for people who I wouldn't
wholly let in.

29:15.045 --> 29:19.715
Always giving in to
temptations while in
relationships, and I'm...

29:20.843 --> 29:23.927
...embarrassed
to admit that, but...

29:25.181 --> 29:26.305
...it's true.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.559
Somehow, though, I, uh...

29:33.063 --> 29:34.313
...it's been different
with you.

29:38.027 --> 29:38.942
[laughing]

29:38.944 --> 29:39.943
[phone ringing]

29:39.945 --> 29:41.528
Hold on. [laughing]

29:42.865 --> 29:44.856
Oh, it's my sister.

29:44.933 --> 29:47.826
She's been worried about Raw
after the fire. Can you
give me one minute?

29:47.828 --> 29:49.620
-Yeah. Yeah, of course.
-Okay.

29:49.622 --> 29:52.456
Charley? Hey, yeah, no,
we're all okay.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.502
Okay. After that accident...

29:56.504 --> 29:57.795
[sighing]

30:26.116 --> 30:28.075
So I think we're looking
at the wrong pattern.

30:28.110 --> 30:29.827
<i> I have a hunch</i>
<i> about something.</i>

30:29.829 --> 30:32.371
We knew about the Black
farm loan applications
being denied.

30:32.447 --> 30:34.665
Then Landry mentioned
lightning fires,

30:34.741 --> 30:37.626
which made me think
that there also might be
disaster relief claims.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.379
[Ralph Angel] <i> Parthena file</i>
<i> for one, too.</i>
<i> But it never came.</i>

30:40.414 --> 30:44.883
...while the white farmers'
claims were processed
immediately.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.594
Look in the folders I made
split by race
of the landowners.

30:47.596 --> 30:49.096
<i> It's organized</i>
<i> by claim causes.</i>

30:49.172 --> 30:53.100
Okay. Um, I have
the white farmers' insurance.

30:53.102 --> 30:55.853
<i> Yeah, lightning fire claims</i>

30:58.941 --> 31:00.899
They're all approved.

31:00.901 --> 31:03.151
[Vince] <i> And the adjacent</i>
<i> Black farms rejected.</i>

31:03.153 --> 31:04.444
Do the dates correspond?

31:04.446 --> 31:05.529
[Billie] <i> They match exactly</i>

31:05.531 --> 31:06.938
Bingo.

31:06.940 --> 31:10.450
Between that
and the misfiled
loan extensions,

31:10.527 --> 31:12.536
this is concrete evidence
of discrimination.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.912
[Ralph Angel] <i> Damn sure is.</i>

31:13.914 --> 31:15.539
[Darla] <i> We're at</i>
<i> the USDA office.</i>

31:15.541 --> 31:17.249
We're gonna get 'em talking.

31:19.920 --> 31:24.047
Mr. Miller. Our loan amount,
paid in full.

31:26.677 --> 31:30.804
Hon, this is
a US Government office,
this isn't a pawn shop.

31:30.881 --> 31:34.016
I can't accept money
that's been unlawfully gained.

31:34.018 --> 31:37.603
Though given the amount
of unlawful tender you've
accepted from the Landrys,

31:37.730 --> 31:39.354
I don't see how
that'd be a problem.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.555
Excuse me?

31:40.557 --> 31:42.524
Too bad about Mr. Randolph.

31:42.526 --> 31:44.318
Losing his job and everything?

31:46.238 --> 31:49.823
The Landrys, they're pillars
of this community.

31:49.900 --> 31:52.326
And they deserve a fair shake
just like everybody else.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.536
Years of missed loan payments
is a fair shake, Mr. Miller?

31:54.538 --> 31:56.955
They're from
an upstanding family.

31:56.957 --> 32:00.417
They're not just a lazy thug
out looking for a handout.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.294
And I'm here to maintain
that natural order.

32:02.296 --> 32:03.795
I'm good, baby.

32:03.797 --> 32:07.132
He's not saying nothing
to make me upset.

32:07.134 --> 32:10.928
The real truth is, he's
a thug, who might lose his job
and maybe his freedom.

32:10.930 --> 32:14.598
Sir, if, if you'll just take
our check, we can both
go our separate ways.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.267
You can place as many checks
as you want to on this desk,

32:17.269 --> 32:19.978
but until I can verify
the source of the income,

32:19.980 --> 32:22.064
there's nothing you can do
to make me turn 'em in.

32:23.692 --> 32:26.276
There must be some way

32:26.278 --> 32:28.862
for us to convince you
to process our payments.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.126
Look, everybody
greases the skids.

32:43.286 --> 32:45.712
That's just the way it's been
done here for years.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.255
It's just business.

32:47.341 --> 32:49.257
Now, I can't guarantee you
anything.

32:49.843 --> 32:51.051
But it couldn't hurt.

32:53.764 --> 32:54.846
So, cash, then?

32:55.432 --> 32:56.381
Yeah.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.226
Thank you.
We'll be right back.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.105
[doors slamming shut]

33:03.732 --> 33:05.440
-[sighing]
-Got yo lazy.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.150
[laughing]

33:08.529 --> 33:10.487
[Miller on recording] <i> Look,</i>
<i> everybody greases the skids</i>

33:10.489 --> 33:13.323
<i> That's just the way it's bee</i>
<i> done here for years.</i>

33:13.400 --> 33:15.492
They get so used
to getting away
with everything.

33:16.203 --> 33:17.577
Good to keep their eyes open.

33:17.654 --> 33:18.996
And mouths closed.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.831
[laughing]

33:27.339 --> 33:28.463
[Nova] What are you doing?

33:29.883 --> 33:31.750
I can't believe this.

33:31.752 --> 33:34.594
I was in a tent in the Sudan
checking that weather app
once an hour,

33:34.596 --> 33:37.556
desperate to know
how you were, and you were...

33:37.558 --> 33:40.308
...here,
with your ex-cop boyfriend
that's the love of your life.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.353
[sighs]

33:43.430 --> 33:45.263
Guess you call everyone that.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.277
You had no business
reading that. That is
such a violation of trust.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.254
You'd know all about that.

33:52.256 --> 33:53.447
All right, well, since you
decided to read something
I asked you not to,

33:53.449 --> 33:55.348
did you read 'til the end?

34:07.296 --> 34:11.214
I called him the love
of my life before I even knew
what love was.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.092
I didn't realize how much pain

34:14.094 --> 34:15.802
I was holding onto.

34:17.264 --> 34:20.515
So many what-ifs
clouding my thoughts.

34:22.144 --> 34:24.061
And to make space for you...

34:25.814 --> 34:27.647
...I needed to let go
of all that.

34:27.649 --> 34:29.024
And now...

34:29.860 --> 34:34.362
...there is nothing
holding me back.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.868
What would I think about you
when I think of you?

34:40.871 --> 34:42.862
It is simple.

34:44.541 --> 34:49.127
There's no variables,
there's no complications,
no pros and cons to weigh.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.048
Just searing singularity.

34:55.969 --> 34:59.554
And I thought you were
right there with me in this,
like, really in it.

35:03.685 --> 35:04.810
But I been on an island.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.105
Loving you.

35:09.191 --> 35:10.982
And you've been
struggling to love me.

35:11.059 --> 35:12.609
Dominic.

35:14.863 --> 35:16.696
I am right...

35:17.407 --> 35:18.406
...here.

35:22.663 --> 35:24.538
You have to believe me.

35:35.843 --> 35:38.135
[birds chirping]

35:38.211 --> 35:40.554
I always hoped you'd look
at me like this someday.

35:40.556 --> 35:42.305
I've always seen you, Vince.

35:43.100 --> 35:44.224
I just...

35:46.186 --> 35:47.602
...I couldn't see myself.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.522
With you, or with anybody.

35:52.693 --> 35:53.817
Explains a lot.

35:55.237 --> 35:56.611
I know I hurt you.

35:59.074 --> 36:01.616
I just gotta get used to it,
you know?

36:05.873 --> 36:08.790
Lately, I tell myself,
[sighing] she loves you.

36:09.960 --> 36:10.792
You're good.

36:14.423 --> 36:15.463
You got...

36:16.008 --> 36:17.799
...you have a home. Kids.

36:20.137 --> 36:22.804
Whatever her reasons are,
are her reasons.

36:23.015 --> 36:25.240
They have to be okay.

36:28.270 --> 36:34.941
You know, I have let my issues
stop me from doing something
that was important to you.

36:39.489 --> 36:40.780
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.192
[kissing]

36:54.129 --> 36:58.757
Vince, thank you for loving me
more than I love myself.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.593
I adore you, baby.

37:03.138 --> 37:07.057
I have loved
and I have cherished you.

37:08.644 --> 37:11.228
And I wanna do that
until death do us part.

37:14.858 --> 37:16.191
[exhaling]

37:17.069 --> 37:18.235
Will you marry me?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.949
[chuckling] Hell, yes.

37:24.025 --> 37:26.826
-[laughing]
-Hell, I... Yes.

37:26.828 --> 37:30.455
-Yes! Yes, yes, yes.
-[both laughing]

37:30.532 --> 37:32.666
-[Billie] Mmm.
-[both laughing]

37:33.001 --> 37:34.584
[Violet clearing throat]

37:34.661 --> 37:38.046
Oh! Daddy. What,
what are you doing here?

37:38.090 --> 37:42.550
Well, the wedding suite
was beautiful, but it's
nothing like our own home.

37:42.552 --> 37:46.346
I'm so sorry, uh,
Mr. Prosper, I, um...

37:46.423 --> 37:48.473
We just really didn't think
you were coming
back here tonight.

37:48.550 --> 37:50.141
You have a good night,
kids. Have fun.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.726
Okay. Um...

37:51.728 --> 37:52.811
...sorry.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.272
[both] Weddings.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.940
[both laughing]

37:58.485 --> 38:01.152
Boy, that was a good one.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.780
-Mmm-hmm.
-[laughing]

38:03.782 --> 38:08.118
You coulda at least let me try
to carry you
over the threshold.

38:08.120 --> 38:12.122
I'm not gonna be dragging
my husband to the ER
on our first night.

38:13.000 --> 38:13.915
Say that again?

38:14.918 --> 38:16.126
What?

38:16.128 --> 38:19.671
-Husband.
-[laughing] You silly.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.841
"Husband."

38:22.843 --> 38:25.385
-[both laughing]
-Mmm-hmm.

38:25.462 --> 38:27.512
[clearing throat] Where do you
think you going?

38:27.589 --> 38:30.598
We've only been married
five minutes.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.310
I have to leave something
to the imagination.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.312
[exclaiming, laughing]

38:35.388 --> 38:36.604
Mmm-hmm.

38:37.441 --> 38:38.857
[exhaling]

38:42.612 --> 38:44.863
[humming]

38:47.951 --> 38:49.567
[surface noise]

38:49.569 --> 38:56.333
["That's How Strong
My Love Is"
by Eddie Giles plays]

39:11.641 --> 39:16.353
Uh, you're sure you okay
with delaying the honeymoon?

39:22.152 --> 39:25.737
I don't need to go frolicking
on the beach somewhere.

39:25.739 --> 39:28.156
I've got everything I need...

39:29.743 --> 39:32.744
...right here in front of me.

39:32.821 --> 39:34.037
Mmm-hmm.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.373
My husband.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.041
[laughing]

39:41.338 --> 39:42.420
Mmm...

39:42.422 --> 39:44.439
[Darla] Thank you,
Councilwoman.

39:44.441 --> 39:46.007
[Councilwoman Barrera
over phone] <i> Absolutely.</i>
<i> So, it's all set.</i>

39:46.051 --> 39:48.885
That means a lot,
Miss Barrera. Appreciate it.

39:48.962 --> 39:50.303
<i> -My pleasure.</i>
-Bye.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.964
[exhaling]

39:52.966 --> 39:57.268
How she got that audio
to the Senate Agricultural
Committee so quickly is...

39:57.345 --> 40:00.355
Now, it's on me.
You know I'm not good
at public speaking.

40:00.357 --> 40:02.290
Don't do that.

40:02.292 --> 40:05.193
You said you weren't good
at school. You said
you weren't good at math.

40:05.195 --> 40:10.031
But you can calculate crop
profits and debt percentages
without a calculator.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.951
And now, you're saying you're
not good at public speaking.

40:13.027 --> 40:17.497
But I have seen you rally
old school farmers...

40:17.499 --> 40:19.416
-[laughing]
-...stuck in their ways,

40:19.492 --> 40:22.293
and you get them to do
completely new things
with the co-op.

40:22.295 --> 40:23.586
Barely.

40:23.663 --> 40:24.778
You're really good at it.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.132
And you're gonna be
good at this.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.511
-Okay, where's my phone?
-Hmm.

40:31.513 --> 40:32.837
Look at her.

40:32.839 --> 40:34.472
-[gasps]
-Yeah, she walking
before she crawl.

40:34.474 --> 40:36.349
Told you she was smart.

40:36.426 --> 40:38.393
-[gasps]
-Lookit, that's my baby girl.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.769
[Darla laughing]

40:39.771 --> 40:42.605
-Look at you.
-Look at you.

40:42.607 --> 40:45.150
Vi said you did the same thing
at her age.

40:45.226 --> 40:46.526
Remember that.

40:48.321 --> 40:52.907
True! Look at you standing
all by yourself.

40:52.909 --> 40:56.703
-My little cutie pie.
-Look at you standing up by
yourself, you little genius.

41:01.918 --> 41:05.670
I don't know what
you so jumpy for. You've
done this lots of times.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.213
Not in this
kinda neighborhood.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.925
Most who live like this
keep cops on speed dial.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.845
What you wanna do?

41:13.847 --> 41:14.929
Give me a minute.

41:15.682 --> 41:17.098
This is my stakeout.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.934
[laughing]
You Easy Rawlins now?

41:19.936 --> 41:21.227
[laughing]

41:22.105 --> 41:23.563
I don't know.

41:25.734 --> 41:28.193
That's it. That's her.

41:28.269 --> 41:30.153
That's my friend.
That's Betty.

41:30.271 --> 41:30.904
Let's go.

41:30.980 --> 41:31.946
Uh-uh.

41:33.700 --> 41:34.949
It's best I do this on my own.

41:37.037 --> 41:38.328
I'll be here.

41:41.249 --> 41:42.624
[door shuts]

42:19.663 --> 42:20.745
<i> Hi, Ray-Ray.</i>
