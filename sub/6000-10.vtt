00:00.246 --> 00:01.800
(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...

00:01.863 --> 00:02.945
It's about Lori.

00:03.032 --> 00:04.197
She tried to kill herself.

00:04.283 --> 00:05.248
Have you talked to her?

00:05.334 --> 00:06.667
No, and I'm not going to.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.167
I mean, she could have died

00:08.203 --> 00:09.953
and you're acting like you
wouldn't have even cared.

00:10.039 --> 00:11.371
Lori, she sent me here.

00:11.457 --> 00:13.457
I thought you came because
your parents kicked you out.

00:13.542 --> 00:14.624
I think she was just
trying to get me to lure

00:14.710 --> 00:16.043
Carter away from the Wilsons.

00:16.128 --> 00:17.878
I think that's maybe something
that Carter should know.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.763
(Taylor) I'm just wondering
why you never told me

00:19.848 --> 00:20.964
about what happened to your mom.

00:21.050 --> 00:22.215
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,

00:22.267 --> 00:23.717
but it wasn't because I didn't trust you.

00:23.802 --> 00:25.435
- I don't want you to think that.
- No, I don't.

00:25.521 --> 00:26.770
(Carter) I think I'd like to see her.

00:26.855 --> 00:28.305
(Max) Are you sure this is what you want?

00:28.390 --> 00:29.556
That woman raised me.

00:29.608 --> 00:31.141
If she had actually killed herself

00:31.226 --> 00:32.558
and I had never seen her again,

00:32.644 --> 00:35.062
I just know I would
spend the rest of my life

00:35.114 --> 00:36.313
wondering why on earth

00:36.398 --> 00:38.281
I didn't at least try and help her.

00:38.367 --> 00:39.733
You shouldn't have come.

00:39.818 --> 00:41.234
Well, I wanted to.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.986
You need to leave, Carter.

00:43.072 --> 00:44.071
No, I'm not gonna leave.

00:44.156 --> 00:45.706
I need to be alone, go away.

00:45.741 --> 00:46.907
I love you.

00:46.992 --> 00:48.291
Tell me you love me more.

00:48.377 --> 00:49.910
She said she loved me.

00:49.995 --> 00:51.244
She said I was her mom.

00:51.296 --> 00:52.879
(crying)

00:52.915 --> 00:54.131
Hey.

00:54.216 --> 00:55.966
Come here.

00:56.051 --> 00:57.217
Come on, come on.

00:57.252 --> 00:58.752
It's gonna be okay.

01:00.422 --> 01:02.639
(Carter) How the hell could
I have let this happen?

01:02.725 --> 01:05.425
(Max) You didn't let it
happen, it just happened.

01:05.510 --> 01:07.394
God, I hate myself.

01:07.429 --> 01:08.762
We should talk about this.

01:08.847 --> 01:10.480
Can we please just forget about it?

01:12.684 --> 01:14.151
You needed me and I wasn't there.

01:14.236 --> 01:15.152
Taylor, it's fine.

01:15.237 --> 01:16.269
Girl code.

01:16.355 --> 01:18.271
Except sister code, and I broke it.

01:18.323 --> 01:20.273
If you ever need to
talk, you know I'm here.

01:24.246 --> 01:26.580
I don't think I've ever
felt as bad about anything.

01:28.167 --> 01:29.750
Like sick-to-my-stomach bad.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.636
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.423
The whole situation was just messed up,

01:36.475 --> 01:38.759
and if I could take it back, I would.

01:41.563 --> 01:42.679
So I hope that this doesn't ruin

01:42.765 --> 01:44.931
everything between us.

01:48.937 --> 01:50.487
I can't do this, I really do feel sick.

01:52.107 --> 01:52.939
Yeah, me too.

01:52.991 --> 01:54.441
Like I want to be honest with her,

01:54.526 --> 01:57.277
but at the same time, I
don't know if it's worth

01:57.329 --> 01:58.495
how much it might hurt her.

01:58.580 --> 01:59.946
Max, the longer we wait,

01:59.998 --> 02:01.948
the worse it is going to be.

Morning, sweetie.

Hi.

02:53.719 --> 02:54.835
What's that?

02:54.887 --> 02:56.503
Oh, nothing, just your divorce papers.

02:57.890 --> 02:59.089
- Have a nice day.
- Hang on.

03:00.592 --> 03:01.675
Sit down.

03:04.763 --> 03:06.263
No, these are not divorce papers.

03:06.348 --> 03:07.848
No, they're financial papers

03:07.933 --> 03:10.984
that we need to fill out as
part of our separation agreement.

03:11.019 --> 03:12.903
Which is usually what
comes before a divorce.

03:12.988 --> 03:14.104
Guys, if this is gonna happen,

03:14.189 --> 03:15.405
you should just tell us.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.490
If we decide to get a divorce,
you'll be the first to know.

03:17.526 --> 03:18.859
Yes.

03:18.944 --> 03:20.694
But the last thing that
your father and I want

03:20.779 --> 03:22.913
is for you two to be stressed about this.

03:22.998 --> 03:24.281
Oh, right.

03:24.366 --> 03:26.283
Yeah, Wilson Family 2.0.

03:26.368 --> 03:28.034
Less stress.

03:30.923 --> 03:32.706
So just because two people
are getting separated

03:32.791 --> 03:34.841
doesn't mean they're getting a divorce.

03:34.877 --> 03:36.042
Correct.

03:36.094 --> 03:37.761
Why don't you let us
worry about the details

03:37.846 --> 03:40.013
and you just focus on you, okay?

03:40.048 --> 03:41.514
The parents will take care of it.

03:41.550 --> 03:43.216
Okay, well, I'm going to Peter Cho's house

Did you ask the lawyers to file?

03:50.692 --> 03:51.725
They called.

03:51.810 --> 03:54.311
The separation agreement
isn't valid unless they file.

03:54.396 --> 03:55.862
That would've been nice if
you had given me a heads-up.

03:55.898 --> 03:57.781

09:08.076 --> 09:09.742

(Taylor) She didn't
really say much about it.

09:20.088 --> 09:21.304
Was the hospital scary?

09:21.389 --> 09:23.089
It was kind of depressing, but...

09:24.676 --> 09:26.425
- ... it wasn't the worst part.
- What was?

09:26.511 --> 09:31.180
When Carter when it,
Lori told her to get out,

09:31.266 --> 09:34.267
then she said she never
wanted to see her again.

09:35.353 --> 09:37.186
I don't know why I'm even surprised.

09:37.272 --> 09:39.021
And then on the way home,

09:39.107 --> 09:40.323
Carter was really upset.

09:42.694 --> 09:45.244
I thought she was gonna lose it, so I...

09:45.280 --> 09:48.948
I pulled over so that she
could get some fresh air.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.750

No, I should've gone with her.

10:14.142 --> 10:15.474
But at least she had you.

She wasn't totally alone.

10:51.396 --> 10:53.980
Oh, um, there are only three bedrooms,

10:54.015 --> 10:55.481
so some of us are gonna have to share.

- This is nice.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.703
Oh, yeah, and the heating
doesn't work very well in here,

11:17.755 --> 11:19.205
so we're probably gonna have
to go outside and get some

11:19.290 --> 11:20.289
kindling from the barn.

Lori.

11:25.930 --> 11:27.346
I guess when you're on
the run as much as she is,

11:27.382 --> 11:29.131
you pick up some survival skills.

11:32.020 --> 11:33.185
Okay.

11:33.221 --> 11:34.553
I'm gonna go check out the gazebo.

Okay, um, Taylor, we didn't...

11:54.575 --> 11:57.543
I mean, I didn't even realize
how hard it'd be to see her.

11:57.578 --> 11:59.078

Lori.

No, come on, Taylor.

18:22.092 --> 18:23.808
Well, what would you do?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.927
Just keep lying and hope nobody found out?

19:36.920 --> 19:38.720
I think I'm just gonna
hang out here for a while.

19:46.847 --> 19:48.897
Okay, if we're gonna do
cocktails, we need a playlist,

19:48.982 --> 19:51.566
but it has to be something woodsy.

19:51.651 --> 19:53.017
Can you handle it?

19:54.354 --> 19:55.687
Mad?

19:57.491 --> 19:58.523
I couldn't tell her.

19:58.608 --> 20:00.108
- I tried.
- Why not?

20:00.193 --> 20:01.326
She has enough on her mind.

20:01.361 --> 20:02.527
Okay, like what?

20:02.612 --> 20:04.529
I can't say, but...

20:05.582 --> 20:06.698
she's in a bad situation

20:06.750 --> 20:07.699
and me telling her about Lori just

20:07.784 --> 20:08.917
would not have helped anything.

20:09.002 --> 20:11.503
Okay, what kind of bad situation?

20:11.538 --> 20:14.756
Something happened on her
trip to go see Lori and...

20:17.127 --> 20:18.126
I can't tell you.

20:18.211 --> 20:19.210
- Why not?
- I can't.

20:19.296 --> 20:20.295
Well, Max was there, right?

20:20.380 --> 20:21.629
- So I'll just ask him.
- Don't.

20:21.715 --> 20:23.548
Why not? It's gonna make things worse.

20:23.633 --> 20:24.966
What things?

20:25.051 --> 20:26.684
Okay, did something happen between them?

20:26.720 --> 20:28.102
Did they get into a fight?

20:31.224 --> 20:32.390
Oh.

20:32.475 --> 20:33.608
Okay, I thought you were gonna say they

20:33.693 --> 20:35.443
robbed a bank or something.

20:35.529 --> 20:36.861
What is she so worried about?

20:36.897 --> 20:38.563
It's not like they
cheated and Max and Taylor

20:38.615 --> 20:39.898
have already broken up.

20:39.950 --> 20:41.616
Yeah, but Taylor's not
gonna see it that way.

20:41.701 --> 20:43.067
Well, it's not like it's
something Max and Carter

20:43.119 --> 20:44.652
never did before.

20:44.738 --> 20:46.120
Yeah, but that was before Taylor.

20:47.407 --> 20:48.823
(Damon) Hey!

20:48.909 --> 20:50.625
What's the deal with the cocktails?

20:56.216 --> 20:58.333
David was absentminded

20:58.418 --> 21:01.085
long before he was a professor.

21:01.137 --> 21:02.136
How so?

21:03.390 --> 21:04.589
On our first date,

21:04.674 --> 21:06.925
he took me to a four-star restaurant.

21:07.010 --> 21:07.926
And?

21:07.978 --> 21:10.395
And he forgot his wallet.

21:10.430 --> 21:12.063
And you had to pay?

21:12.098 --> 21:13.064
Yes.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.732
(chuckling)

21:14.768 --> 21:16.601
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.030
He has a very sweet side.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.865
You know, he used to say this thing.

21:23.917 --> 21:26.167
You know when your necklace,
the back of it is in front?

21:26.202 --> 21:27.785
He would adjust it for me like this

21:27.871 --> 21:30.254
and he would say, "Make a wish."

21:36.629 --> 21:38.379
Oh my God, it's probably getting late.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.682

21:42.135 --> 21:43.685
Well, it was great getting to know you.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.054
Yeah, it was really fun hanging out.

21:46.139 --> 21:49.107
- I'm just gonna leave these here for David.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

- Good night.
- Good night.

I'm sorry, I had to
talk to someone about it.

22:04.541 --> 22:05.656
I was going crazy.

22:05.742 --> 22:06.958
Maybe it's a good thing.

22:07.043 --> 22:08.242
You know, tell her, get
it out there in the open,

22:08.294 --> 22:11.412
then we'll just deal with whatever happens.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.581

Why not?

22:57.627 --> 22:58.876
What are we talking about?

22:58.962 --> 23:00.511
I'm not quite sure.

23:00.597 --> 23:01.629
Something about Taylor.

- What about her?
- I don't know.

23:07.187 --> 23:09.187
Yeah, she was fine before we drove up.

23:09.272 --> 23:11.556
Okay, she was fine
before but now she's not.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.224
What changed?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.359
What changed must have been the drive up,

23:15.445 --> 23:16.310
with Max.

23:16.396 --> 23:17.812
Is it something to do with her and Max?

23:17.864 --> 23:19.147
Guys, she's fine.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.481

23:20.533 --> 23:21.649
It's not even about her.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.067
But it's about Max.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.452
If it's not about Max and Taylor,

23:24.487 --> 23:27.655
it must be about Max and someone else?

23:27.707 --> 23:29.290

Hey.

We gonna watch these movies or what?

23:38.635 --> 23:40.051
Where is everyone else?

23:43.973 --> 23:45.756
Taylor deserves to know now.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.058
- Where is she?
- Shh.

23:47.143 --> 23:48.509
She's in the kitchen.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.428
You need to calm down
and stop being so selfish.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.813
It's not about me.

23:51.848 --> 23:54.098
I care about her and I don't want her hurt.

23:54.184 --> 23:56.067
I agree, except telling her will also hurt.

23:56.152 --> 23:57.852
Listen, this is none of our business.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.687
It's gone way too far
and we can't get involved.

23:59.772 --> 24:00.905
It's supposed to be a secret.

24:00.990 --> 24:02.824
Whatever you want to call it, it's a lie

24:02.859 --> 24:05.409
- and lies suck and they always come out.
- They don't have to.

24:05.495 --> 24:07.745
It feels like she should
know, but right here, now?

24:07.831 --> 24:09.247
It could be pretty humiliating.

24:09.332 --> 24:11.916
What's humiliating is that
everyone knows but her.

24:12.001 --> 24:14.785
- Why are you getting so hysterical?
- I'm not getting hysterical.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.370
If someone cheated on someone you loved,

24:16.456 --> 24:18.206
- you'd be cool with it?
- I wouldn't be cool with it

24:18.258 --> 24:20.374
but I also wouldn't want to
be the one to tell, either.

24:20.426 --> 24:23.294
Good, so we keep it a secret
and let them work it out.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.428
No.

24:24.514 --> 24:26.047
I'm not gonna be a part of some big lie.

24:26.099 --> 24:27.765
It's disrespectful to Taylor.

24:27.851 --> 24:29.217
So you're gonna tell her?

24:29.269 --> 24:30.801
- She needs to know.

about what she was doing,

everything she did before,

you would understand.

28:42.606 --> 28:44.055

28:49.613 --> 28:51.229
Are you seriously going to stand here

and compare this to what
happened with me and Max?

28:54.902 --> 28:56.535
No, I just...

28:56.570 --> 28:57.869

That's all I'm saying.

29:02.826 --> 29:04.075
I can't do this with you.

29:09.750 --> 29:10.749
(wincing)

29:10.801 --> 29:12.417
- Does that hurt?
- It's fine.

29:12.469 --> 29:14.085
- It's good.
- Okay.

29:16.006 --> 29:18.256
Taylor, you know you can trust me, right?

29:18.342 --> 29:19.558
Of course.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.092
Even if you are kinda goofy.

29:23.564 --> 29:25.063
I need to tell you something.

29:25.098 --> 29:27.849
Like why you were fighting Damon.

29:27.935 --> 29:29.317
And why you're so mad at Max.

29:29.403 --> 29:30.435
It's not about Damon.

29:31.939 --> 29:34.156
Okay, so it's about Max.

29:34.241 --> 29:36.858
I know you still have feelings for him,

29:36.944 --> 29:38.193
a lot of feelings.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.163
But I just want you to be careful.

29:42.282 --> 29:43.782
What are you talking about?

29:45.118 --> 29:46.117
Hey.

29:47.588 --> 29:49.588
Can I talk to you?

29:49.623 --> 29:50.839
It's important.

29:52.176 --> 29:53.175
Yeah.

29:54.461 --> 29:55.961
I'll be right back.

29:57.047 --> 29:58.180
Don't go anywhere.

30:01.351 --> 30:03.768
I don't know what you guys
are talking about in there.

30:03.804 --> 30:05.687
Oh, he just wants to talk to me.

30:06.974 --> 30:09.474
I'll come find you right after, I promise.

30:09.526 --> 30:10.809
Okay.

30:12.145 --> 30:13.812
'Cause I really want to talk to you.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.531
Sure.

30:16.617 --> 30:17.732
Right after.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.071
(dog barking in the distance)

30:29.213 --> 30:30.495
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:30.547 --> 30:32.163
Um, Hillary...

30:32.249 --> 30:33.498
She called me from the car.

30:33.550 --> 30:35.917
She said she spent the afternoon here.

30:36.003 --> 30:37.252
I hope that wasn't weird.

30:37.337 --> 30:38.637
No, it wasn't weird.

30:38.672 --> 30:40.672
Um, it was nice.

30:40.724 --> 30:42.057
Okay.

30:43.176 --> 30:44.893
- She's sweet.
- Yeah, she is.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.096
She likes you.

30:50.684 --> 30:52.267
And you seem like you like her.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.902
Yeah, I guess so.

30:53.987 --> 30:55.770
I mean, yeah, I do.

30:58.692 --> 30:59.608
I'm gonna go out.

30:59.693 --> 31:00.659
Ooh, kinda late.

31:00.694 --> 31:01.910
No.

31:01.995 --> 31:05.030
Just, um... Kyle, he works the late shift

31:05.115 --> 31:07.365
- and we're just gonna go out for a drink.
- I'm sorry, you don't have to tell me what you're doing.

31:07.451 --> 31:09.284
You don't have to be sorry, it's fine.

31:11.672 --> 31:13.121
Well, have fun.

31:14.758 --> 31:15.924
Oh, uh...

31:17.044 --> 31:19.711
... I wanted to apologize for being testy

31:19.763 --> 31:20.962
about the legal stuff today.

31:22.215 --> 31:23.932
If you want, we could go over it tomorrow.

31:25.218 --> 31:26.935
Yes, absolutely.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.055
Tomorrow.

31:32.559 --> 31:33.975
(crickets chirping)

31:36.280 --> 31:37.228
Max?

31:38.448 --> 31:39.447
I'm ready to talk.

31:49.076 --> 31:50.292
I didn't tell her.

31:50.377 --> 31:52.410
♪

31:52.496 --> 31:53.411
Thank you.

31:55.165 --> 31:56.965
I wanted to, 'cause she should know.

31:58.502 --> 32:01.136
Gabe, I promise we are going to tell her.

32:03.590 --> 32:04.472
She really loves him.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.258
I hope she's gonna be okay.

32:08.562 --> 32:09.511
Yeah, me too.

32:12.316 --> 32:13.982
He asked about us.

32:14.067 --> 32:16.101
About... where we are.

32:17.738 --> 32:18.820
He's a good friend.

32:18.905 --> 32:20.605
He worries about me.

32:20.691 --> 32:22.774
What'd you tell him?

32:22.826 --> 32:24.109
I told him the truth.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.028
What's that?

32:28.615 --> 32:30.915
That...

32:30.951 --> 32:33.201
I miss you every day...

32:33.286 --> 32:34.836
and that I only started the whole thing

32:34.921 --> 32:36.504
with Ofe because I...

32:38.125 --> 32:39.874
... I didn't know how to feel.

32:42.462 --> 32:43.511
And I'm sorry.

32:44.765 --> 32:47.048
You don't need to say sorry for anything.

32:49.853 --> 32:50.802
We were broken up.

32:50.854 --> 32:52.637
I know.

32:52.723 --> 32:55.473
But I just wanted to talk about it...

32:55.559 --> 32:57.976
because being with him...

32:59.479 --> 33:01.363
... made me realize how much I miss you.

33:03.567 --> 33:04.649
And...

33:06.119 --> 33:07.652
... what we have is...

33:09.990 --> 33:11.322
It's pretty incredible.

33:13.627 --> 33:14.659
Yeah, it is.

33:14.745 --> 33:16.828
I mean, think about all the things

33:16.880 --> 33:18.713
that we've been through together.

33:18.799 --> 33:20.215
More than most people.

33:22.586 --> 33:24.669
I don't feel like myself
when I'm not with you.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.006
Same for me.

33:29.309 --> 33:31.092
So you're not mad about Ofe?

33:31.178 --> 33:32.427
No, I'm definitely not mad.

33:33.730 --> 33:34.929
Not even a little?

33:35.015 --> 33:36.681
No.

33:36.767 --> 33:38.066
Well, I'm sorry anyway.

33:40.020 --> 33:41.436
I wish it had been different.

33:43.156 --> 33:44.355
It's all in the past.

33:46.410 --> 33:48.193
And like I said, we were broken up.

33:52.365 --> 33:53.364
Okay.

33:54.418 --> 33:56.501
I've been honest with you.

33:56.536 --> 33:57.585
It's your turn.

33:58.839 --> 33:59.954
Okay.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.423
Did you sleep with Bird?

34:04.761 --> 34:05.877
What?

34:05.929 --> 34:07.796
I mean, it's okay.

34:07.881 --> 34:09.013
You can tell me.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.632
I know you guys were living together

34:10.717 --> 34:12.350
and I saw you at that party.

34:12.385 --> 34:14.268
Taylor, I didn't sleep with Bird.

Ever.

34:19.693 --> 34:21.391

34:21.478 --> 34:22.976
I promise you.

34:23.063 --> 34:24.395
Oh...

34:25.732 --> 34:26.981
Oh, God.

34:28.201 --> 34:29.818
I was so nervous to ask you,

34:29.902 --> 34:31.319

34:32.873 --> 34:34.405
and everything, but...

34:36.076 --> 34:38.326
If you had slept with her, I...

34:38.411 --> 34:40.078
I'm not gonna lie, I'd be upset.

34:40.163 --> 34:41.963
You know how I am.

34:42.047 --> 34:45.166
You know how long it
took me to forgive Crash.

34:47.254 --> 34:49.804
I don't know, I...

34:49.889 --> 34:51.005
I have some things to work on.
