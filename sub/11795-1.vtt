00:03.036 --> 00:05.038
 ( bell rings )

00:05.071 --> 00:07.073
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:07.107 --> 00:09.976
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:10.010 --> 00:12.846
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.879 --> 00:16.349
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.383 --> 00:22.088
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.122 --> 00:25.225
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.258 --> 00:28.194
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:28.228 --> 00:31.064
 <i>* Ridin' low on my chair</i>

00:34.601 --> 00:39.105

00:59.059 --> 01:04.230
<i>* It's all right</i>

01:18.478 --> 01:20.847
 - ( knocking )
 - Come in.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.251
   What are you guys
   doing here?

01:25.285 --> 01:28.621
  Kelly,
  we can't wait any longer.
  We've come for your answer.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.156
 That's right.
 Next week is the prom

01:30.190 --> 01:32.092
 - and you've got
 to choose between us.
 - Right.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.094
Oh, come on.
I like you both.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.096
  I don't want to hurt
  either one of you.

01:36.129 --> 01:39.566
   Hey, if you want
   to hurt Slater, it's okay.

01:40.867 --> 01:43.103
Hey, why would she want
to go with a boy

01:43.136 --> 01:45.305
   when she can go
   with a gladiator?

01:46.906 --> 01:48.975
  Guys, this is hard.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.945
 It's like choosing between
 two great pieces of chocolate.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.313
 Sorry, Kelly,
 from now on,

01:53.346 --> 01:56.116
   you only get zits
   from one of us.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.118
Okay, if l must.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.186
Both: You must!

02:00.220 --> 02:02.122
I want my mommy.

02:02.155 --> 02:05.125
   Hey, she can go with Zack.

02:05.158 --> 02:07.861
  Listen, I'll give you my
  answer in the morning, okay?

02:07.894 --> 02:09.596
All right then.

02:09.628 --> 02:10.797
Kelly...

02:26.179 --> 02:28.148
   This is
   Geraldo Screech.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.216
 ( applause )

02:33.620 --> 02:36.089
   Today's topic is,
   "Women Who Love Two Men."

02:36.089 --> 02:38.992
   It's trashy, tacky,
   tasteless... It's <i>Geraldo.</i>

02:39.092 --> 02:41.094
  ( applause )

02:42.796 --> 02:45.198
  Kelly cannot choose
  a date for the prom.

02:45.231 --> 02:47.267
   So what has this two-timer
   put her men through?

02:47.300 --> 02:49.869
 - A hunk-off, Geraldo Screech.
 - A hunk-off indeed.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.572
 - What do your friends think?
 - I think it's romantic.

02:52.605 --> 02:55.675
 I think it's
 reverse macho-pigism,
 and l don't like it.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.377
Then l don't like you.

02:57.410 --> 03:01.147
 Zack and Slater are dead even.
 And what's
 the final event, Kelly?

03:01.181 --> 03:04.184
- Evening wear.
- Disgusting. l love it.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.821
 ( soft music plays )

03:07.854 --> 03:09.889
  ( applause )

03:24.571 --> 03:27.607
   Kelly, it's time to choose
   one of these bimbos.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.321
  So how does it feel
  to be a loser, Zack?

03:41.354 --> 03:44.090
 Well, I'm not a loser,
 Geraldo Screech.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.159
I'll always love Kelly.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.596
  I just want her to be happy.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.732
 Don't forget tomorrow:
 "Blond Boys Who
 Never Date Again."

03:52.766 --> 03:56.136
This is Geraldo Screech.
Good night.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.076
 You've actually decided who
 you want to take to the prom?

04:03.109 --> 04:05.645
  - Yes.
  - Both: Who?

04:07.113 --> 04:09.115
Guys, hi, uh...

04:11.084 --> 04:14.087
 Any girl would be lucky to go
 to the prom with
 either one of you.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.757
 Slater, you're
 everything a girl could want.

04:18.791 --> 04:22.295
  You're great looking,
  a great dancer, a great guy.

04:22.328 --> 04:24.297
 Great.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.332
  But, I'm sorry.
  I'm going with Zack.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.802
   Ohh! Why?!

04:28.835 --> 04:30.970
  What does Zack have
  that l don't have?

04:31.071 --> 04:33.573
Zack, hold it together.
You are Zack.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.276
   Wait, l am Zack!

04:36.309 --> 04:38.411
She's... she...
you're going...

04:38.445 --> 04:41.348
 She's going with Zack!
 Ohh, she's...

04:41.381 --> 04:42.482
 She's going with Zack!

04:42.515 --> 04:45.452
 ( laughs )
 Oh, thank you!

04:45.485 --> 04:48.655
 All right, all right.
 You won, Preppie.

04:50.190 --> 04:52.525
You just better
treat her good.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.332
Now that Kelly's
picked Zack,

04:59.366 --> 05:01.568
   it's time to snatch me up
   before I'm taken.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.636
  Will you go
  to the prom with me?

05:03.670 --> 05:06.306
- Yeah, I'll go.
- You will?!

05:06.339 --> 05:09.676
 I'll go when with you
 when worms have ears.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.115
   You're weakening.

05:17.283 --> 05:20.353
  Do you know
  what's in that box?

05:22.489 --> 05:25.692
  Just a bunch
  of worms with ears.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.962
  Screech cut out
  a bunch of little paper ears

05:29.062 --> 05:32.298
and pasted them
on these worms.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.967
 Now you can go
 to the prom with him.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.069
 I am not going
 to the prom with him.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.571
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

05:40.740 --> 05:43.143
  That's why not.
  Because he is always there.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.079
   He's been hunting me
   ever since nursery school.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.314
 Just go to the movies
 with me Friday night,

05:48.348 --> 05:50.383
 and if you don't have
 a good time, no prom,

05:50.417 --> 05:52.419
 and I'll be out
 of your life forever.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.887
   What do you have to lose?

05:55.789 --> 05:58.425
  Okay. One date,
  then you're history.

05:58.458 --> 05:59.793
   All right!

05:59.826 --> 06:03.663
You may keep the worms,
my darling.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.903
 Lisa, l cannot wait
 to pick out my dress.
 It's my first formal.

06:09.936 --> 06:13.573
   Maybe something in yellow
   to match Zack's hair.

06:13.606 --> 06:15.675
 - ( knocking )
 - Come in.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.946
 Gotta go. We'll go shopping
 right after school, okay? Bye.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.916
  - Hi, Daddy.
  - Hi, honey.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.218
 Mom told me that you're
 really excited about the prom.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.354
Yeah, we're going to go
buy my dress tomorrow.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.255
 I remember when l took
 your mom to the prom.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.124
   My feet never
   touched the floor.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.692
  You were that much in love?

06:32.726 --> 06:35.729
Well, actually
l was a terrible dancer.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.065
  My feet were on top
  of your mother's
  feet all night.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.602
  We had a ball.
  I hope you do, too.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.604
Thanks.

06:44.637 --> 06:48.408
 Kelly, um... Why don't
 you sit down, honey?

06:48.441 --> 06:50.243
  There's something
  l have to tell you.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.315
  Is something wrong?

06:55.348 --> 06:58.518
   Well, yeah, I'm afraid so.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.588
 World peace broke out.

07:01.621 --> 07:04.190
- That's good isn't it?
- For the world, yes.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.760
  But not if you work
  in a defense plant.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.462
  I lost my job today.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.632
 - Oh, Daddy, that's terrible.
 - No, no, no.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.467
 Everything's gonna be
 all right.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.803
 I'm telling you first because
 l know you'll help

07:16.836 --> 07:18.571
 keep everybody else's
 spirits up

07:18.605 --> 07:20.507
while I'm trying to find
another job.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.946
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

07:27.947 --> 07:30.050
I want to help.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.954
   I want you to take
   this money.

07:35.055 --> 07:38.158
  Kelly, l gave you that money
  last week for the prom.

07:38.191 --> 07:41.127
 I'm not going
 to the prom.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.596
  There are seven other people
  in this house besides me.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.700
  Family comes first.

07:46.733 --> 07:48.968
  Honey, this is not
  why l came up here.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.071
 I know that.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.973
 But you've got
 to let me do this.
 I'll go to the prom next year.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
   Unless peace really
   gets out of hand.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.646
 Kelly, l can't let you
 do that, honey.

07:59.679 --> 08:02.782
Why not?
You do it all the time.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.719
   Remember when you saved up
   all your money
   for your golf clubs

08:05.752 --> 08:07.153
  and l needed braces?

08:07.187 --> 08:08.288
 Yeah.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.490
 My smile is better
 than your golf score.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.626
You needed them.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.029
   And you need this.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.266
  You're sure
  you're all right about this?

08:20.300 --> 08:23.269
  Positive.
  Have l ever
  lied to you, Daddy?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.839
 Never.

08:40.886 --> 08:43.722
   ( crying )

08:43.756 --> 08:46.860
   It's the first time
   l ever lied to my father.

08:54.634 --> 08:57.470
   Okay, now we have exactly
   214 minutes

08:57.504 --> 08:59.673
 to shop at the Palisades Mall
 before dinner.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.745
   Here's our route.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.748
 You have a map
 of the mall?

09:08.782 --> 09:12.318
   I have a map of every mall
   from here to Tijuana.

09:12.352 --> 09:15.789
 Lisa, l can't go
 to the mall with you.

09:15.822 --> 09:17.357
  Why?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.259
 I'm not going
 to the prom.

09:19.292 --> 09:22.429
  Oh no. Don't tell me
  Slater killed Zack?

09:23.663 --> 09:26.633
No. My dad lost his job
and we need the money.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.769
 - I'm sorry, Kelly.
 - Have you told Zack?

09:29.803 --> 09:32.472
 Not yet.
 But I'm sure he'll understand.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.574
 Hi, girl of my dreams.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.409
I already rented my tux
and guess what?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.445
  - Zack, l have to talk to...
  - No, in a second,
  in a second.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.047
Wait till you
hear the best part.
Me and a couple of guys,

09:41.047 --> 09:44.918
  we chipped in,
  we got us a big stretch limo
  with a CD, TV...

09:44.951 --> 09:48.822
   and M.E. Thanks to you,
   this is gonna be
   the best night of my life.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.157
   - Zack...
   - What? Anything.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.660
   I... uh...

09:53.693 --> 09:56.296
  - Can't wait to
  see you in your tux.
  - All right!

09:56.329 --> 09:58.231
   Hi, guys.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.204
   All right,
   settle down, settle down.
   Now next weekend

10:04.237 --> 10:07.207
  is our annual Bayside Prom,
  and l want it to
  be our best ever.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.542
 That's why I've
 called a meeting
 of all Prom Chairmen.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.879
 Don't you mean
 chairpersons?

10:12.912 --> 10:16.116
  Hey, the chair-chick
  has a point.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.652
 Zack, l know that you and Lisa
 are in charge of decorations,

10:19.686 --> 10:22.422
 but this year's theme
 is not going to be

10:22.455 --> 10:25.158
"Zack and Kelly's Prom."

10:25.191 --> 10:27.560
  Don't you love it, sir?
  It sings. Look at that Zack.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.596
Didn't she tell him yet?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.664
  No, she doesn't want
  to break his heart.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.333
Mr. Belding,
would you please

10:33.366 --> 10:36.102
  tell the chair-babes
  to be quiet?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.872
 Will the chair-pig
 please mind his own business?

10:38.905 --> 10:40.573
   Ooh! Yeah!

10:40.607 --> 10:44.077
 Babes, pigs, please,
 come to order. Morris.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.180
  Now, Slater, Jessie,
  what do you have for music?

10:47.213 --> 10:49.349
   He wants lambada.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.918
She wants protest music.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.953
I'm sure there's
a compromise somewhere,

10:53.987 --> 10:56.756
 between <i>Dirty Dancing,</i>
 and <i>The Best of</i>
 <i>Nelson Mandela.</i>

10:56.790 --> 10:59.059
( laughs ) Ahem.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.894
  All right, now who's
  in charge of food?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.496
  - I am, sir.
  - Who else would be?

11:03.530 --> 11:06.166
Stop with the fat jokes
or I'll sit on you.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.201
  Ooh, this is getting heavy.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.870
   Hey, will you two
   cut it out?

11:10.904 --> 11:13.273
Now what kind of food
is your
committee serving, Alan?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.942
 Chocolate fudge cake,
 strawberry shortcake,

11:15.975 --> 11:18.078
   hot fudge sundaes
   with whipped...

11:18.078 --> 11:21.715
   Man, you're gonna
   have to grease the
   doorway to get home, Alan.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.850
 Belding: Alan, Alan...

11:23.883 --> 11:28.488
   I love cake, but
   don't you think that's all
   just a little bit rich?

11:28.521 --> 11:32.325
Right. That's why we're
not having any dessert.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.428
What are you
chairperson of, Robert?

11:35.462 --> 11:37.430
Nothing.
I just came to tell you

11:37.464 --> 11:39.099
   that the chemistry
   lab's on fire.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.368
  Got any marshmallows, dude?

11:42.535 --> 11:44.504
  Code Red! Code Red!

11:49.709 --> 11:52.178
  I can't believe you
  like these tapes.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.681
   Hey what's wrong
   with Paula Abdul
   and Janet Jackson?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.584
 Their music
 doesn't say anything.

11:57.617 --> 12:01.221
  Did you ever see them move?
  They're saying plenty, baby.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.425
   Don't call me baby, bubba.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.295
Are you guys
still fighting?

12:09.329 --> 12:11.364
That's what we do best.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.467
Lisa, is there anything
we can do for you?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.903
Well, yeah. You can
change your name to Lisa

12:16.936 --> 12:18.672
 and go to the movies
 with Screech tonight.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.440
  What movie are you going to?

12:20.473 --> 12:23.143
  <i>Zombies in Love.</i>
   Guess who picked it?

12:24.611 --> 12:26.646
Hey, let's try this one.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.851
- ( dance music plays )
- All right,
now come on, mama.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.220
  Let's see if we can
  move meaningfully.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.725
   Hey, l like this.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.730
 Hey, you move
 pretty good.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.799
   Thanks.
   You're okay, too.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.702
 You know we haven't
 fought for 15 seconds.

12:48.735 --> 12:51.838
  It was 20. Shut up.

12:51.871 --> 12:55.809
 Hey, uh... do you have
 a date for the prom?

12:55.842 --> 12:59.112
   Uh... No, not yet.
   How about you?

12:59.112 --> 13:02.549
  Not exactly. You know,
  I'm still narrowing it down.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.786
 You think that, uh...
 I don't know,

13:06.820 --> 13:08.888
perhaps...
you would, uh...

13:08.922 --> 13:12.359
  Slater, are you asking me
  to go to the prom with you?

13:12.392 --> 13:15.061
Maybe.
You interested?

13:16.229 --> 13:18.231
 Maybe.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.700
  Maybe...
  pick you up at 7:00?

13:20.734 --> 13:24.070
 No. I'll pick you up at 7:00.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.646
   Gee, Lisa, l can't believe
   we're finally on
   a date together.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.949
 Are you having
 a good time?

13:37.684 --> 13:39.819
"Are you having
a good time?"

13:39.853 --> 13:41.855
"Are you having
a good time?"

13:41.888 --> 13:43.890
"Are you having
a good time?"

13:43.923 --> 13:46.092
   - "Are you having
   a good time?"
   - Yes!

13:46.092 --> 13:49.129
   All: Yes!

13:49.162 --> 13:51.531
   You want me to go get you
   some popcorn, my love?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.299
Yes, please go.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.235
( thunder clap )

13:55.268 --> 13:56.903
   ( woman screams )

13:56.936 --> 14:00.040
 Lisa,
 why don't you sit next to him
 and give the date a chance?

14:00.073 --> 14:02.075
  Why don't you tell
  Zack about the prom?

14:02.108 --> 14:05.812
- What?
- Nothing.
Have some more popcorn.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.548
 - Guess who?
 - ( screams )

14:08.581 --> 14:11.217
   All: Shh!

14:11.251 --> 14:14.621
  I got the wide
  container so both our hands
  can fit in at once.

14:16.256 --> 14:19.392
Um, Screech,
would you go get me some
chocolate malt balls?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.728
  l knew you'd
  want them.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.132
You know, popcorn
really makes me thirsty.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.468
  - Do you think
  you could get me...
  - Cola?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.470
   Or uncola?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.639
Uncola, please.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.077
  Hey, no arm,
  no soda.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.919
  When do the zombies
  fall in love?

14:45.952 --> 14:47.954
Shh. You'll see.

14:47.987 --> 14:50.090
  Is that the zombie?

14:50.090 --> 14:52.125
 No, that's his mother-in-law,
 his "mombie."

14:53.226 --> 14:55.195
  Where's Matt Dillon?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.497
He's not in this movie.
Just watch.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.033
   Look, there's the zombie.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.935
- Shh!
- What?

15:02.035 --> 15:04.070
  All: Quiet!

15:05.138 --> 15:07.240
He's cute
for a dead guy.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.608
That's a female zombie.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.777
  Can't you see she's
  wearing high heels?

15:10.810 --> 15:14.147
  You're into fashion.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.916
   Are you sure Matt Dillon's
   not in this movie?

15:16.950 --> 15:20.687
   Yes,
   Alan Thicke is the zombie.
   Everybody knows that.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.158
  What a great movie, Screech.

15:25.191 --> 15:28.061
Screech? Where are you?

15:28.061 --> 15:30.930
   I missed most of the movie
   'cause of
   motor-mouth down there.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.299
   Next time go to the movies
   with Matt Dillon.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.268
  This has been the worst date
  of my life.

15:35.301 --> 15:38.138
Forget the prom!

15:38.171 --> 15:41.074
 Wait... wait a minute.
 You're not
 supposed to dump me.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.409
   I'm supposed to dump you.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.081
   You know, Slater,

15:48.081 --> 15:49.683
tonight's
turning out to be okay.

15:49.716 --> 15:53.319
  Yeah, l know what you mean.
  I can't wait for the prom.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.388
Why don't you guys come
with us in our limo?

15:55.422 --> 15:58.358
  - It'll be fun, huh, Kelly?
  - All right. Sure.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.927
I don't think that's
such a great idea, Zack.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.328
Why not?

16:02.362 --> 16:05.031
 Because, um...

16:05.031 --> 16:06.700
 I can't go
 to the prom with you.

16:20.780 --> 16:23.616
  Hey, hey, why don't you pick
  on a locker your own size?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.252
 Very funny, Slater. Why don't
 you mind your own business?

16:26.286 --> 16:29.055
   Oh, please don't hurt me,
   "blond Hulk."

16:35.562 --> 16:38.064
   ( groans )

16:38.064 --> 16:40.633
 Aw, did little Preppie
 hurt himself?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.236
Let Uncle Slater
kiss it better.

16:43.269 --> 16:45.638
 Look, I'm bummed out,
 all right?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.907
   - Kelly dumped me.
   - Is that what you think?

16:47.941 --> 16:49.409
  Yeah. Every time l call her,

16:49.442 --> 16:51.378
her mother says
she's washing her hair.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.747
 Who washes their hair
 six times a day?

16:53.780 --> 16:56.216
 - You do.
 - Besides me.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.919
 - I don't believe her.
 - Well, you shouldn't,

17:00.020 --> 17:02.222
 because it's not true.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.223
   What do you mean?

17:04.257 --> 17:07.694
  Look, Jessie told me
  that Kelly's
  father lost his job

17:07.727 --> 17:09.762
  and she can't afford
  to go to the prom.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.032
 I had no idea.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.236
  Poor Kelly.

17:16.269 --> 17:19.705
  You got it, Preppie.
  Poor Kelly.
  Not poor Zackie.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.179
  ( knocking )

17:34.621 --> 17:36.056
 Can l come in?

17:37.657 --> 17:39.659
 Sure.

17:41.928 --> 17:45.799
   Kelly, l know how
   much you really wanted
   to go to the prom tonight.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.701
   It's okay.

17:47.734 --> 17:50.236
 You lied to me, honey.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.439
 Yeah.

17:52.472 --> 17:56.710
I know what you gave up
for the family.

17:56.743 --> 18:00.814
  And l want you to know
  that l am very proud of you.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.917
   I think I'm going to cry.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.252
  Why don't you wait on that?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.355
There's somebody
here to see you.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.527
   Zack, what are you
   doing here?

18:14.561 --> 18:17.297
   Well, l was just hanging
   around outside your room,

18:17.330 --> 18:20.367
and l thought I'd
drop in and say, "Hi."

18:20.400 --> 18:22.402
I, uh...

18:22.435 --> 18:24.404
 gotta go
 wash my hair.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.240
Because of you there's
a drought in California.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.746
I just found out
about your dad.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.814
Why didn't you tell me?

18:34.848 --> 18:38.451
   I don't know. You were
   so excited about the prom,

18:38.485 --> 18:41.554
 and l guess l was
 a little embarrassed.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.623
 I owe you an apology.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.760
   No, you don't have
   to apologize for anything.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.062
 Why aren't you
 at the prom?

18:49.062 --> 18:50.964
  Oh, is that tonight?

18:51.064 --> 18:53.099
Gosh, l must
have forgotten.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.802
 There must have been 100 girls
 who would love to go with you.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.570
 Mmm,
 actually 106.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.573
 Just kidding.

19:02.776 --> 19:05.011
   I'm sorry l ruined
   your night.

19:05.011 --> 19:08.715
  It would be ruined
  if l went with someone else.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.917
   I think I'm going to cry.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.720
 Your father warned me
 about that so, uh...

19:13.753 --> 19:16.489
  why don't we go
  for a walk instead?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.525
  I'd like that.
  Where are we going?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.026
It's a surprise.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.464
( dance music playing )

19:27.734 --> 19:29.035
 Great prom, huh, Alan?

19:29.035 --> 19:30.704
  Yeah, the cake's delicious.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.606
- Have you been dancing?
- No, I've been icing.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.510
   - Want some?
   - Maybe I'll
   have a lick later.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.715
   All right, Nardino.
   We have rules around here.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.850
   You and Mancuso
   show me some air.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.588
 Hey, hey, hey!
 Separate or I'll get the hose!

19:50.890 --> 19:53.093
  Then this zombie
  that looked like Matt Dillon

19:53.126 --> 19:54.828
 gave a dead rose
 to the female zombie.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.830
   And then, the male zombie
   didn't like that at all,

19:56.863 --> 19:58.198
  so do you know what he did?

19:58.231 --> 19:59.833
 Probably got earplugs.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.535
   Now you know why
   l dumped the babe.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.275
  ( clapping rhythm )

20:16.149 --> 20:18.151
   ( cheers )

20:22.856 --> 20:24.891
 Zack, what are
 we doing here?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.793
 Told you l had
 a surprise.

20:29.529 --> 20:31.564
   What is all this?

20:31.598 --> 20:34.300
 - It's a prom picnic.
 - You're crazy.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.669
Only about you.

20:38.038 --> 20:39.739
  There we go.

20:39.773 --> 20:41.808
 Zack, this is so nice.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.244
 Yep, and now we have
 everything they have in there.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.980
   Even two pieces of cake
   l wrestled away from Alan.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.382
Sorry there's no icing.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.420
   Zack, l don't know
   how to thank you.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.222
 Don't.
 Just close your eyes.

20:59.059 --> 21:01.161
   Give me your hand.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.800
   A corsage. It's beautiful.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.936
  - I think I'm going to cry.
  - No, please don't.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.072
You might put
out the candle.

21:17.177 --> 21:20.613
   Hey, Alan, old buddy,
   how about some cake, huh?

21:20.647 --> 21:24.684
 No. There are
 only five pieces left
 and l want to take them home.

21:26.086 --> 21:27.454
 Come on, Alan.

21:28.388 --> 21:32.359
Here, have some peanuts.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.362
   Alan, Alan, look!

21:35.395 --> 21:37.397
  - There's Sara Lee!
  - Where?

21:41.368 --> 21:43.903
  <i>Okay, guys and gals,</i>
  <i>lovers and lovees.</i>

21:43.937 --> 21:46.139
<i>This is the last dance.</i>
<i>Make it magic</i>

21:46.172 --> 21:48.842
  <i>while the Screechman</i>
  <i>takes you home.</i>

21:48.875 --> 21:51.344
  <i>Ladies, your choice.</i>

21:51.378 --> 21:53.380
  ( soft music plays )

22:10.730 --> 22:13.633
 Zack, will you
 dance with me?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.869
 Sure.

22:26.346 --> 22:29.716
   Zack, l don't know how
   to thank you for tonight.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.553
We're together.
That's enough.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.308
  ( instrumental music plays )
