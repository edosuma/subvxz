[NARRATOR] Our heroes, Goku and
Bulma, along with Oolong the 

02:03.959 --> 02:06.875
shape-changing pig, are
unaware that they're still being

02:06.959 --> 02:10.584
tailed by Yamcha and Puar as
they follow their radar to

02:10.667 --> 02:13.250
the seventh, and
final, Dragon Ball!

02:15.000 --> 02:16.917
[BULMA] It won't be
long now, you guys!

02:18.917 --> 02:20.334
[BULMA] Wow!

02:20.417 --> 02:23.084
I can't believe I'm so close
to having my wish fulfilled!

02:23.167 --> 02:25.500
I wonder what he's
going to look like?

02:25.584 --> 02:27.375
[OOLONG] Hey, I've
been meaning to ask.

02:27.459 --> 02:29.375
So this big wish--
there's gonna be enough

02:29.459 --> 02:30.959
for all of us, right?

02:31.042 --> 02:32.959
I was thinking along the lines
of all the gold in the world!

02:34.375 --> 02:36.792
[BULMA] Oh, I forgot
to tell you didn't I?

02:36.875 --> 02:39.292
A boyfriend! That's
what I'll wish for!

02:39.375 --> 02:42.084
[OOLONG] What?! A boyfriend?!

02:42.167 --> 02:43.667
[BULMA] What's wrong?

02:43.750 --> 02:46.417
[OOLONG] So you're gonna waste
our wish so you can get yourself

02:46.500 --> 02:48.125
a boyfriend? What a rip off!

02:48.209 --> 02:50.209
[BULMA] What?!
You take that back!

02:51.209 --> 02:52.959
I think that
you're just jealous!

02:54.292 --> 02:55.959
[OOLONG] I knew I
should have stayed at home!

02:56.042 --> 02:57.667
[BULMA] Whoa! Slow down!

02:57.750 --> 02:58.917
[GOKU] Look out!

02:59.000 --> 02:59.917
[OOLONG] Huh?

03:01.167 --> 03:04.750
--[BULMA screaming]
--[brakes screeching]

03:07.834 --> 03:09.334
[BULMA] Learn how to drive!

03:23.709 --> 03:25.584
[cawing]

03:30.417 --> 03:33.250
[PUAR] Hey Yamcha , I'm
beginning to think they're lost.

03:33.334 --> 03:36.292
I can't believe the last
Dragon Ball is way out here!

03:36.375 --> 03:38.459
[YAMCHA] Be patient.
Puar, It's out there,

03:38.542 --> 03:41.084
I know it is! I can
feel it--we're close!

03:41.167 --> 03:42.167
Real close!

03:42.250 --> 03:45.417
Soon I will wish
away my fear of women!

03:46.667 --> 03:50.209
--[gasping]
--[running footsteps]

03:50.292 --> 03:52.500
[SHU] I'm gonna be toast if
I don't get to that meeting

03:52.584 --> 03:54.042
with Emperor PIlaf!

03:54.125 --> 03:56.375
[PILAF] Mai, if you don't fix
that Dragon Ball detector by

03:56.459 --> 03:59.375
the time I count to ten, then
you will be joining my hungry

03:59.459 --> 04:01.084
friends here for lunch!

04:01.709 --> 04:03.167
[roaring]

04:04.625 --> 04:05.417
One...

04:08.125 --> 04:09.125
Two...

04:09.209 --> 04:10.084
Three...

04:10.167 --> 04:11.042
Four...

04:11.125 --> 04:11.917
Five...

04:13.292 --> 04:14.959
[MAI] Uh, Emperor Pilaf!
Speaking of lunch, you...

04:15.042 --> 04:16.209
you must be hungry right?

04:17.084 --> 04:19.500
[PILAF] Well, yes. I am hungry!

04:19.584 --> 04:23.125
Starving, really. You
know, a hamburger

04:23.209 --> 04:24.834
would be nice right now.

04:24.917 --> 04:27.709
Hold it! What
number was I on, Mai?

04:27.792 --> 04:29.167
[MAI] Huh?

04:29.250 --> 04:31.334
[PILAF] Nevermind.
I'll start over.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.209
One, two, three

04:33.292 --> 04:34.459
Four. Five. Six.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.542
[screams]

04:36.042 --> 04:37.167
[MAI] Emperor Pilaf!

04:37.250 --> 04:38.750
[PILAF] What now?

04:38.834 --> 04:40.375
[MAI] Oh nothing, it's just...
well, sometimes, when you take

04:40.459 --> 04:43.875
command like this, it's
invigorating to be around you.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.667
[PILAF] Oh! I see!

04:47.334 --> 04:48.834
[roaring]

04:49.792 --> 04:51.792
Oh, right. Now
where was I?

04:52.209 --> 04:52.667
[MAI] Huh?

04:54.292 --> 04:56.084
[PILAF] Okay, maybe
I should start at...

04:56.167 --> 04:56.667
Six!

04:56.750 --> 04:58.417
[roaring]

05:00.125 --> 05:02.125
[SHU] I made it sire! I made it!

05:02.209 --> 05:04.542
[PILAF] Excellent, Shu,
you're right on time.

05:04.625 --> 05:08.042
Now, have you
located the balls? Report!

05:08.125 --> 05:10.167
[SHU] Well, I ordered pizza.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.542
[MAI] Sire, I fixed it!

05:13.917 --> 05:15.917
[MAI] The Dragon Ball detector
is working and we're already

05:16.000 --> 05:17.875
receiving a signal
on one of the balls.

05:17.959 --> 05:20.417
Attempting to isolate signal
and increase magnification

05:20.500 --> 05:21.459
to level five.

05:21.542 --> 05:23.375
[MAI] Level six, seven, eight.

05:23.459 --> 05:25.917
Signal isolated at
magnification level nine, sir!

05:27.917 --> 05:30.500
Oh my! This can't be!

05:30.584 --> 05:33.250
There's a ball just ten
steps south of this location!

05:33.334 --> 05:34.709
And a couple
of steps east.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.584
No, wait... it's south.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.667
By about... oh...
I'd say seven paces.

05:40.542 --> 05:42.834
Then, six steps straight
ahead and you're there!

05:44.000 --> 05:45.709
[SHU] I found it!

05:45.792 --> 05:46.917
[PILAF] Argh!

05:49.459 --> 05:51.167
Oh, what do we have here?

05:51.250 --> 05:55.709
Look, it's a Dragon Ball!
The one we already have!

05:55.792 --> 05:58.875
That monkey-boy and his friends
have the Dragon Balls we want,

05:58.959 --> 05:59.709
so where is he?!

06:00.792 --> 06:03.167
We have a spy
bird tracking him.

06:03.250 --> 06:04.667
[MAI] Mecha number seven.

06:05.375 --> 06:07.625
There it is now, Emperor.

06:07.709 --> 06:11.209
[MAI] Once we download the
visuals from Mecha 7, we'll know

06:11.292 --> 06:13.084
exactly where they are going.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.834
Ringleader, they just passed
out of the northern quadrant

06:40.917 --> 06:42.334
and they're heading southwest!

06:42.417 --> 06:43.584
Over!

06:43.667 --> 06:46.084
[PILAF] Excellent! Tell
big brother to engage!

06:46.167 --> 06:47.250
Roger!

06:47.334 --> 06:48.750
[MAI] Come in, big
brother, do you copy?

06:48.834 --> 06:49.917
Over!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.167
[SHU] 10-4, baby sister!
I got my ears on!

06:52.250 --> 06:54.167
The subject
is approaching.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.084
[SHU] Okie-dokie! Over!

06:58.250 --> 07:00.459
Bulma, I'm going to
ask you nicely this time.

07:00.542 --> 07:03.084
Would you please,
please change your wish!

07:03.167 --> 07:05.375
There must be something
you want that the three of us

07:05.459 --> 07:06.959
can split between us?

07:07.042 --> 07:09.334
Remember, Oolong, just
one word from me and you'll have

07:09.417 --> 07:11.959
to go to the bathroom
thanks to that pill!

07:12.042 --> 07:13.042
[growling]

07:13.792 --> 07:15.959
--[brakes squealing]
--[screaming]

07:16.500 --> 07:18.625
Oolong, you're making me mad!

07:18.709 --> 07:20.500
[OOLONG] This is
a protest, Bulma!

07:20.584 --> 07:23.125
I'm not moving another inch
until you change your wish

07:23.209 --> 07:24.625
to something reasonable!

07:24.709 --> 07:28.042
Sure! I wish you'd just
shut your face and drive!

07:29.250 --> 07:31.084
[SHU giggling]

07:31.167 --> 07:33.209
Now I've got 'em!

07:33.292 --> 07:35.042
This could take all day, Puar.

07:35.125 --> 07:36.750
[growling]

07:36.834 --> 07:39.084
Look, we've come all this way!

07:39.167 --> 07:41.584
Let's just shut
up and go for it!

07:41.667 --> 07:43.750
Not this pig!

07:44.959 --> 07:45.667
Piggy!

07:45.750 --> 07:47.834
Piggy! Piggy!

07:48.375 --> 07:49.709
That's not fair!

07:51.667 --> 07:53.834
[explosive diarrhea]

07:53.917 --> 07:56.709
[SHU] They're sitting
ducks! [giggling]

07:57.209 --> 07:59.959
I hope your new
boyfriend comes with diapers.

08:00.792 --> 08:03.459
[grumbling]

08:08.334 --> 08:12.084
[screaming]

08:17.334 --> 08:19.125
What happened?

08:19.209 --> 08:22.125
Ow! Uh? We got blown up!

08:22.209 --> 08:23.084
Think we should help them?!

08:23.167 --> 08:25.125
In a minute, Puar!

08:34.750 --> 08:36.167
[OOLONG] Oh no!

08:37.667 --> 08:39.625
Wow! What is that?

08:44.208 --> 08:47.167
[SHU] I've come to
repossess your Dragon Balls!

08:53.125 --> 08:56.167
Thank you! And
so long, suckers!

08:56.875 --> 08:58.750
[SHU] The balls are mine now!

08:58.834 --> 09:00.959
[laughing]

09:01.042 --> 09:04.292
[mechanical springing]

09:04.375 --> 09:06.334
That thing just
stole our Dragon Balls!

09:06.417 --> 09:08.459
'Reposessed' them.

09:08.542 --> 09:10.000
It stole them!

09:10.084 --> 09:12.417
Goku, you're our only hope!
Hurry!

09:12.500 --> 09:13.917
Call the Flying Nimbus!

09:15.042 --> 09:17.167
Flying Nimbus!

09:26.042 --> 09:27.417
[GOKU] Hurry up, Nimbus!

09:36.875 --> 09:39.000
[BULMA] Get those
Dragon Balls, Goku!

09:39.084 --> 09:40.667
We're counting on you!

09:42.084 --> 09:46.042
[engine sputtering]

10:01.750 --> 10:03.750
I think we actually did it,
Shu!

10:03.834 --> 10:05.959
[SHU] Emperor Pilaf
will be very happy!

10:06.042 --> 10:07.667
[SHU] Maybe he'll even
stop yelling at us!

10:23.667 --> 10:24.625
[GOKU] There it is!

10:28.000 --> 10:30.750
Okay, monster! Don't
you know it's not nice

10:30.834 --> 10:32.375
to steal stuff?!

10:35.417 --> 10:37.125
What's wrong with him?

10:37.750 --> 10:39.417
Hey, you, monster!

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
Give me back those
Dragon Balls or else!

10:44.625 --> 10:45.792
Maybe he's playing dead.

10:48.584 --> 10:51.334
Hello? Come on, wake up!

10:57.709 --> 11:00.459
Hey! That's it! Hand 'em over!

11:02.375 --> 11:05.334
[muttering]

11:07.125 --> 11:08.750
Hey, you!

11:10.292 --> 11:12.084
[crash]

11:20.000 --> 11:22.625
Stiff as board.
Yup, he's dead.

11:35.750 --> 11:39.917
[BULMA] Oh, it sure is
taking Goku a long time...

11:40.000 --> 11:43.959
Hey, kid, I got an idea!
Forget that wish, okay?

11:44.042 --> 11:45.959
What? No way!

11:46.042 --> 11:47.625
Hey, I could
be your boyfriend!

11:47.709 --> 11:49.000
Whatta ya say? Huh?

11:49.084 --> 11:51.500
I say thanks,
but no thanks! Got it?!

11:51.584 --> 11:53.584
Yeah I got it.
It's your loss.

11:53.667 --> 11:54.959
Yeah, right!

11:55.042 --> 11:56.584
Oh, now I see
what you're after.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.917
You don't want a
real hunk, do ya?

11:59.000 --> 12:02.584
You want some conjured up
whipping boy from that dragon.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.250
What do you
mean by that, huh?!

12:05.334 --> 12:07.000
[GOKU] Hey guys!

12:07.084 --> 12:08.709
[BULMA] Goku!

12:09.584 --> 12:11.167
That monster's dead!

12:12.334 --> 12:15.042
[BULMA] Uh, Goku?
Who's got the Dragon Balls?!

12:15.125 --> 12:16.542
[GOKU] Uh, I don't know.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.250
It's all over!

12:19.334 --> 12:23.792
[sobbing]

12:23.875 --> 12:26.375
[BULMA] My boyfriend!
It's not fair!

12:26.459 --> 12:28.459
They've probably summoned
the Dragon already...

12:32.375 --> 12:33.625
But, I've still got one.

12:38.042 --> 12:39.042
Of course!

12:39.125 --> 12:40.167
They thought they
could outsmart us!

12:40.250 --> 12:41.834
No way, mister!

12:42.959 --> 12:44.875
You did it!
You're the best! Yay!

12:44.959 --> 12:46.792
I knew I could count on you!

12:47.709 --> 12:48.917
It was easy
Bulma, honest!

12:49.000 --> 12:50.292
You don't have to thank me.

12:50.709 --> 12:52.125
You can thank me!

12:54.000 --> 12:55.417
Now! Let's get 'em!

12:55.500 --> 12:57.792
Let's get out there and
find those Dragon Balls!

12:58.459 --> 12:59.917
They won't get far!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.959
Get in the car, you two! We
can track them with my radar!

13:03.042 --> 13:06.125
[OOLONG] Hey, fearless
leader! You forget?

13:06.209 --> 13:07.792
Our car got blown up!

13:08.667 --> 13:11.875
Ah-ah-ah! That's okay, Oolong.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.834
I still have my Dyno Caps!

13:15.542 --> 13:20.209
Oh, I forgot! They were
in there with the Dragon Balls!

13:20.542 --> 13:25.209
[sobbing]

13:27.750 --> 13:29.084
[PUAR] What should
we do, Yamcha?

13:29.167 --> 13:30.375
I think they need a lift.

13:30.459 --> 13:33.084
I know,
and she scares me...

13:33.167 --> 13:34.292
Now what?

13:34.375 --> 13:36.709
No choice.
We've gotta give them a ride.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.500
But Yamcha, what about
your fear of girls?!

13:39.584 --> 13:43.167
I don't have a choice.
If we don't help them now,

13:43.250 --> 13:45.375
we're never gonna get
those Dragon Balls!

13:46.084 --> 13:48.542
[sobbing]

13:48.625 --> 13:52.834
Stop crying, we'll think
of something, you'll see.

13:52.917 --> 13:55.250
You're just saying that.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.334
You're right.
He is just saying that.

13:57.417 --> 13:59.625
Oh, would you keep quiet?!

13:59.709 --> 14:00.750
[YAMCHA] Hey, look who it is!

14:00.834 --> 14:01.250
[GOKU] Hey, Yamcha!

14:01.334 --> 14:04.167
Hi, Yamcha!

14:04.250 --> 14:08.209
What a coincidence!
Are you guys stuck out here?

14:10.125 --> 14:13.625
Yeah! We were
until you showed up.

14:13.709 --> 14:17.042
Could you give us a ride,
Yamcha? Pretty please!

14:19.000 --> 14:22.542
Sure... we'd be...
we'd be happy to...

14:22.625 --> 14:24.959
Yamcha, I know this might
sound a little weird, but

14:25.042 --> 14:26.917
there's something I'd
like you to do for me.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.875
Would you mind closing
your eyes for a second?

14:28.959 --> 14:30.084
Please?

14:31.292 --> 14:33.167
Close my eyes?

14:34.334 --> 14:35.750
Yeah, just for a second.
Pretty please?

14:36.459 --> 14:37.584
Well, what for?

14:37.667 --> 14:38.917
[BULMA] You'll see.

14:42.625 --> 14:44.292
Aw, come on.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.084
[YAMCHA] Oh no! Is
she really gonna kiss me?

14:47.167 --> 14:48.750
I think I'm gonna die!

14:50.667 --> 14:53.500
You too, Puar!

14:53.584 --> 14:55.542
[BULMA] No peeking, you two!

14:55.625 --> 14:56.959
[BULMA] Hey, not too bad!

14:57.042 --> 14:58.834
[BULMA] They're only about
twenty-five miles away!

14:58.917 --> 15:00.042
[YAMCHA] Can I open my eyes now?

15:00.125 --> 15:01.542
Sure, go ahead.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.750
Hey, nothing happened!
Nothing happened...

15:05.834 --> 15:07.834
Nothing at all!

15:07.917 --> 15:11.584
Hey, something happened,
I just can't say what.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.959
Us girls, we have to keep
our secrets you know?

15:15.167 --> 15:17.375
Don't. Be. Mad.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.625
[YAMCHA screaming]

15:20.542 --> 15:21.709
That was weird.

15:38.750 --> 15:42.459
At last, I have all
seven Dragon Balls!

15:42.542 --> 15:43.084
Uh, sire?

15:43.167 --> 15:44.375
[MAI] Uh...

15:44.459 --> 15:47.792
[PILAF] â™ª No more
Dragon Ball blues da-da! â™ª

15:47.875 --> 15:49.167
But, uh, Emperor...

15:49.250 --> 15:49.875
We... uh?

15:49.959 --> 15:52.250
Uh, we need... one more!

15:52.334 --> 15:56.167
[PILAF] â™ª La-la-la  â™ª

15:56.250 --> 15:57.584
There's only six!

15:57.667 --> 15:59.625
You counted wrong.

15:59.709 --> 16:03.625
[PILAF] Did I just hear you say
we're missing a Dragon Ball?

16:03.709 --> 16:05.875
[MAI and SHU] Yes, sir!
There's only six!

16:07.917 --> 16:09.459
[PILAF] That can't be!

16:09.542 --> 16:14.875
[PILAF] Seven, six, five...
Uh? There's three, and the

16:14.959 --> 16:19.000
two ball and, uh, hmm, let's
see, I-I have the one-star ball.

16:19.084 --> 16:20.709
And- Oh no!

16:20.792 --> 16:23.417
There's one missing!

16:23.500 --> 16:24.459
[PILAF] Is it there?!

16:27.542 --> 16:27.959
Nope!

16:28.042 --> 16:29.542
Sorry, boss!

16:32.167 --> 16:33.542
Fools!

16:33.625 --> 16:37.292
[PILAF screaming]

16:37.375 --> 16:39.792
And you call
yourselves agents!

16:39.875 --> 16:41.375
We're very sorry, sir!

16:41.459 --> 16:44.209
Uh, I think six
is pretty good, sire.

16:44.292 --> 16:45.917
We have to be better
than 'pretty good'

16:46.000 --> 16:47.709
to win this game!

16:47.792 --> 16:50.459
This is the world
we're talking about!

16:50.542 --> 16:56.375
[beeping]

16:56.459 --> 16:59.417
You did say you fixed
this thing, didn't you?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.417
Yes, I did sire.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.750
[PILAF] Oh, goody!

17:02.834 --> 17:04.291
That means those kids with
the last Dragon Ball are

17:04.375 --> 17:05.584
headed this way!

17:07.291 --> 17:08.541
Isn't that sweet?

17:08.625 --> 17:11.750
They're delivering it to
us! Let's go set the traps

17:11.834 --> 17:12.791
for our guests!

17:22.041 --> 17:24.250
[BULMA] Look at
the size of that place!

17:24.666 --> 17:25.625
[GOKU] It's huge!

17:26.666 --> 17:28.209
[OOLONG] Not bad
for a summer home.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.459
[PUAR] Are you okay?

17:32.125 --> 17:34.834
I'm alright.
I just need to make my wish.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.709
Then I'll be cured of this.

17:37.959 --> 17:39.292
[MAI] Everything is ready, sire.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.584
[PILAF] Excellent!

17:41.250 --> 17:42.459
Amateurs...

17:42.542 --> 17:45.334
They have no idea what
they're getting into!

17:46.542 --> 17:49.167
Soon, they will feel
the wrath of Pilaf.

17:49.584 --> 17:50.792
[GOKU] Looks like no one's home.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.542
[BULMA] See if it's open, Goku.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.750
[OOLONG] Um... I don't
think that's a good idea.

17:57.667 --> 18:01.000
[BULMA] That's it! You got
it Goku! Keep pushing!

18:06.667 --> 18:09.542
[gasping]

18:12.917 --> 18:14.667
[GOKU] Let's go!

18:14.750 --> 18:16.834
[BULMA] It's as
dark as night in there!

18:16.917 --> 18:19.584
[OOLONG] Yeah!
And twice as scary!

18:24.584 --> 18:28.375
[squeaking]

18:28.459 --> 18:30.209
Do you guys
hear something?

18:30.292 --> 18:32.167
[BULMA] Shh! Quiet, Oolong!

18:37.500 --> 18:38.584
[YAMCHA] Oh no, bats!

18:38.917 --> 18:49.917
[screaming]

18:50.542 --> 18:51.875
What'd you do that for?!

18:55.000 --> 18:56.625
Uh, I thought
you were a bat!

18:57.750 --> 18:59.834
[OOLONG] My piggy
senses are tingling!

18:59.917 --> 19:01.750
We're in definite danger here!

19:01.834 --> 19:04.917
[BULMA] Oolong, less
talking and more walking!

19:05.000 --> 19:07.750
[wind howling]

19:07.834 --> 19:10.125
[GOKU] It looks clear
down this way, guys.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.375
[OOLONG] Goku,
don't walk so fast!

19:13.459 --> 19:14.417
[BULMA] Shh!

19:25.959 --> 19:27.000
Perfect!

19:30.500 --> 19:33.667
[rumbling]

19:33.750 --> 19:45.542
--[crashing]
--[screaming]

19:45.625 --> 19:47.000
Help me!

19:47.084 --> 19:51.542
[screaming]

19:51.625 --> 19:54.667
[crash]

19:54.750 --> 19:56.084
Got ya!

19:58.959 --> 20:01.250
[crashing]

20:06.542 --> 20:08.084
[crash]

20:08.584 --> 20:10.000
[crash]

20:12.459 --> 20:20.834
[crashing]

20:20.917 --> 20:22.667
[YAMCHA] A... little help?

20:23.334 --> 20:24.834
[GOKU] You guys okay?

20:28.334 --> 20:30.250
Alright! That does it!

20:30.334 --> 20:31.000
Let's go get 'em!

20:31.959 --> 20:34.584
Oh, thank you!
You saved me!

20:35.125 --> 20:40.959
[YAMCHA screaming]

20:41.917 --> 20:43.000
Take a breath!

20:45.625 --> 20:46.500
Golly!

20:48.125 --> 20:49.792
[PILAF] That trap didn't work!

20:50.959 --> 20:52.875
Who designed
that trap anyway?

20:52.959 --> 20:54.917
Uh, it wasn't me, sire.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.709
[PILAF] I want the name of
the ninny who designed it!

20:57.792 --> 20:58.792
It was you.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.459
[BULMA] What's that sound?

21:03.542 --> 21:05.209
[OOLONG] It's just
my teeth chattering!

21:05.834 --> 21:08.375
[YAMCHA] Be careful! There
could be traps everywhere!

21:08.459 --> 21:09.709
[BULMA] Okay...

21:09.792 --> 21:11.625
[OOLONG] Puar, quit
pushing, would ya!

21:11.709 --> 21:13.417
[PUAR] Then get moving, Oolong!

21:15.334 --> 21:16.584
[GOKU] Hey, what's that?

21:17.875 --> 21:20.167
It's a trap, isn't it?

21:20.250 --> 21:21.292
I don't know.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.667
It's too obvious.

21:22.750 --> 21:25.042
[GOKU] Hey there's
another arrow over here!

21:25.542 --> 21:27.792
[YAMCHA] Let's check it out!

21:33.500 --> 21:37.250
[OOLONG] Excuse me, but
where are we going, huh?

21:51.834 --> 21:53.209
[GOKU] It's a dead end!

21:53.292 --> 21:56.334
[OOLONG] Oh, did you
have to say that, Goku?

21:58.959 --> 22:00.375
[YAMCHA] Oh no!

22:00.459 --> 22:02.334
[BULMA] We're trapped!

22:03.667 --> 22:06.167
So, Emperor, what do
you want to do now?

22:06.250 --> 22:09.250
I think maybe I'll
have some fun with them!

22:09.334 --> 22:13.125
Ah, yes. But first,
I'll take their Dragon Ball!

22:13.209 --> 22:19.417
[PILAF laughing]

22:19.500 --> 22:22.250
