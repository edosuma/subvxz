J-O-P-L-I...

-Why?

06:10.453 --> 06:12.789

06:12.872 --> 06:15.249

06:15.333 --> 06:18.336
It's been... 12 hours.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.838
Don't we need time
to get word of mouth?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.048
Oh, the algorithm takes

06:22.131 --> 06:23.966
-word of mouth into account.
-Mm.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.719
But it considers
other things, too.
For instance,

06:26.803 --> 06:28.679
if viewers see someone
eating dessert

06:28.763 --> 06:30.431
within the first two minutes
of the episode,

06:30.515 --> 06:32.767
-they almost always finish
the entire season.
-Always.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.061

Sure.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.767
Barry...

10:42.850 --> 10:44.685
you have massive,

10:44.769 --> 10:47.855
massive rage issues.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.941
And I think they are triggered
when you feel slighted,

10:51.025 --> 10:52.860
maybe?

10:52.943 --> 10:55.529
And perhaps that
would not happen if you
are honest upfront.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.908
But Sally can't know who I am.

-And...

20:40.906 --> 20:43.617
we were in productions together.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.453
And then, you had to go

-And I took your success

20:49.623 --> 20:51.750
very personally.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.170
I started to lie about you.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.714
I started rumors.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.175
And after all that,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.386
you still invite me

21:02.469 --> 21:05.013
into your home.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.392
And that shows me
what kind of guy you are.

21:09.893 --> 21:13.438
Look, I never would have
violated my restraining order

21:13.522 --> 21:16.942
if I didn't think you had made
some big changes in your life.

21:17.025 --> 21:19.403
Well, sometimes you need
a gun held to your head

21:19.486 --> 21:20.821
to see what's important
in this world.

21:20.904 --> 21:23.407
-I know exactly what
you're talking about.
-Mm-hmm.

21:24.199 --> 21:25.534

21:26.576 --> 21:29.246
let me just say I am so sorry.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.333

So, to new--

21:33.417 --> 21:34.918
I'm not done.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.548

with you, Joe.

21:40.757 --> 21:43.260
And lo and behold,
I see somebody else

21:43.343 --> 21:46.555

She's a theater director.

21:52.602 --> 21:55.188

in some productions.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.691
She is a genius,

21:57.774 --> 22:00.944
and I am an asshole boyfriend.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.156
Annie, I am so sorry

22:04.239 --> 22:06.241
for the way I treated you.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.744
But, I am so happy

because it seems like life
has been good to you.

Joe: Well then.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.501
To new beginnings.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.712
You're forgetting the part
where you ruined my career.

22:18.795 --> 22:19.921
Eh, fuck.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.632
-What?
-You blackballed me.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.593
You were furious
that I left you,

22:24.676 --> 22:26.970
and you made it your mission
that I never work in New York

22:27.054 --> 22:28.597
or LA again.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.348
And I didn't.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.268
-I don't remember that.
-Yes, you do.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.312
And I don't think that you're
really apologizing for us.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.690
You're just saying that so you
don't have to feel bad anymore.

22:39.983 --> 22:42.069
I-- Th-that just isn't true.

22:42.152 --> 22:44.821
Well, you saying sorry
doesn't bring my career back.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.574
Joe, I'm so sorry.
I gotta go.

right now, please.

-No.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.291
(crying)

23:38.375 --> 23:39.709
Hey...

23:40.585 --> 23:41.795
Hey...

23:41.878 --> 23:43.880
Hey, is it okay that
I'm comforting you?

23:43.964 --> 23:46.883
Okay. (sniffles)

23:46.967 --> 23:48.051
Are you okay?

23:48.135 --> 23:51.263
(heavy breathing)

23:51.346 --> 23:53.473
My show got canceled.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.934
What?

23:56.017 --> 23:57.853
-(crying)
-Why?

23:57.936 --> 24:00.647
-No one watched it.
-It just premiered last night.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.065
I know!

24:02.149 --> 24:04.484
Fucking BanShe
and fucking Diane Villa.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.153
I mean, they're such cowards.
I mean, their jobs

24:06.236 --> 24:09.239
are totally pointless.
Like, a computer
makes their decisions.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.741
Oh my god.

24:11.825 --> 24:13.869
I'm so sorry.

24:13.952 --> 24:16.204
-(sniffles)
-You worked so hard on that.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.789
Yeah, no shit.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.332
(sighs) For them,
it's just another show,

24:19.416 --> 24:21.877
but for me, you know, it was...

24:21.960 --> 24:23.587
everything.

24:23.670 --> 24:26.089
You know, I just thought, like,
if I could tell this story,

24:26.173 --> 24:29.384
then maybe my life
might... matter.

24:29.467 --> 24:30.760
I know.

24:30.844 --> 24:32.387
(sobs)

24:32.471 --> 24:36.224
-Do you know where she lives?
-I don't know. (sniffles)

24:36.308 --> 24:37.642
What, were you gonna, like,

24:37.726 --> 24:40.478
send her an angry letter
or something? (sniffles)

24:40.562 --> 24:43.106
No, no, nothing like that.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.442
I'm just gonna freak
her out a little bit.

24:46.234 --> 24:48.653
Freak her out how?

24:48.737 --> 24:51.990
Oh, there's a lot of ways.
It's, you know...

24:52.073 --> 24:54.868
nothing bad. No, it's just...

24:54.951 --> 24:56.953
like, for instance, I could...

24:57.037 --> 24:59.206
send her a picture
of herself sleeping.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.333
You know, just as a way
of being like, hey,

25:01.416 --> 25:04.669
not cool what you did
to Sally, you know?

25:06.671 --> 25:08.715
So you'd break into her house?

25:08.798 --> 25:10.592
Oh, she'd never
know I was there.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.052
No, the whole point
is to isolate her

25:12.135 --> 25:14.304
and make her feel like
she's going insane.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.972
So, I would just
do little things

25:16.056 --> 25:19.059
like replace her dog with
a slightly different dog, or,

25:19.142 --> 25:20.852
you know, change
the furniture in her house

25:20.936 --> 25:23.480
so she thinks she's shrinking.
You know, basic stuff,

25:23.563 --> 25:25.273
most of it I learned
in the military.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.275
Some of it on a subreddit.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.446
You know.
Basically, just plant a seed,

25:31.529 --> 25:32.989
and then they just
kinda hang themselves,

25:33.073 --> 25:35.408
so it's super nonviolent.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.743
But by the end of it, like,

25:36.826 --> 25:39.996
her brain will have essentially
eaten itself, you know?

25:41.164 --> 25:44.167
But that's on the table
if you want it.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.794
Okay?

25:45.877 --> 25:47.754
I'm just so sorry
this happened to you.

25:47.837 --> 25:50.131
Can I make you some tea
or something or...

25:50.215 --> 25:52.300
-Barry?
-Hm?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.346
I need you to get away from me.

25:56.429 --> 25:58.098
Why?

25:58.181 --> 25:59.766
Get out.

26:01.309 --> 26:02.811
Did I say something or...

26:02.894 --> 26:04.521
Get the fuck out.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.695
-Get the fuck out!
-Okay. Jesus Christ...

26:12.570 --> 26:15.657
(crying)

26:16.741 --> 26:19.869
(insects chirping)

26:26.293 --> 26:27.877
Okay, there he is.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.171
Okay, remember.
You walk up to him,

26:30.255 --> 26:32.632
you ask for directions,
and then you turn and walk away.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.510
R-right, I'll go up,
I'll ask directions,
and then I'll get outta there.

26:35.593 --> 26:36.678
Yes, it is important for you--

26:36.761 --> 26:37.887
(gunshot)

26:40.390 --> 26:41.975
What the?

26:43.977 --> 26:46.479
-(panting) Oh my god...
-What...

26:46.563 --> 26:50.025
-Oh my-- Mom... Wh...
-(gasping)

26:50.108 --> 26:52.485
-(Kyle groaning)
-Julie: Kyle... No...

26:52.569 --> 26:55.530
(car engine starts)

26:55.613 --> 26:56.740
(tires screech)

27:00.035 --> 27:02.662
(car speeding away)

27:05.665 --> 27:08.835
(insects chirping)

27:18.261 --> 27:21.389
(insects chirping)
