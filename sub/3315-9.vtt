00:09.927 --> 00:14.264
WOMAN:
<i>Because I love him so</i>

00:14.765 --> 00:19.061
<i>I'd be good for nothin' too</i>

00:19.144 --> 00:21.813
<i>I know</i>

00:21.897 --> 00:26.235
<i>Without good-for-nothin' Joe</i>

00:34.493 --> 00:35.619
(door opens)

00:35.702 --> 00:36.703
(door closes)

00:40.749 --> 00:44.795
<i>I'd be good for nothin' too</i>

00:44.878 --> 00:47.339
<i>I know</i>

00:47.673 --> 00:49.675
-<i>I'm goin' home</i>
-(doorbell rings)

00:49.967 --> 00:51.426
-Dr. Curan, I presume?
-<i>To Joe</i>

00:55.013 --> 00:56.849
<i>(jazzy blues music playing)</i>

00:58.976 --> 01:01.728
You work out of your home.
I think that's wonderful.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.856
Well, I cater mostly
to the families in the neighborhood.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.858
Makes it convenient for them and for me.

01:05.941 --> 01:09.236
-And for your wife.
-Oh, I'm not married, not currently.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.196
Where did you say you heard of me?

01:11.738 --> 01:15.200
My girlfriend, Nabby Pierce,
you filled her cavity.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.035
She said you were very good.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.246
Nabby, yes. Nice gal.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.959
Nabby also said you sometimes
made special arrangements

01:24.042 --> 01:26.420
with girls who were a little short.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.548
-You don't have any money?
-Not very much.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.467
I'm still trying to establish myself.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.387
I'm an actress.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.848
I'm gonna make it big. Everyone says so.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.809
You can expect to see me
up on the silver screen one day.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.272
Don't you think we could
come to some kind of

01:45.522 --> 01:48.567
mutually beneficial arrangement,
Dr. Curan?

01:49.484 --> 01:50.944
Well, I don't know.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.779
It hurts, Doctor.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.532
I really need you to fill it.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.370
I'm just going to put this on you.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.002
I don't want to crush your carnation.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.922
It's not a carnation, silly.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.090
It's a dahlia.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.597
Just breathe.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.446
Isn't it a beautiful day, Ava?

02:35.239 --> 02:36.406
Mommy, what's that?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.955
That's nothing, honey.
It's just a department store man...

02:50.212 --> 02:51.672
-(camera shutter clicks)
-(gasps)

04:03.243 --> 04:04.870
Violet's camping out in her room.

04:06.622 --> 04:09.625
I was wondering if you
could make her a sandwich.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.252
-Of course, Dr. Harmon.
-Thank you.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.462
Could you help me a minute?

04:18.759 --> 04:22.346
It must be hard on you
with your wife indisposed.

04:23.222 --> 04:26.141
I miss Vivien. We became quite close.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.895
-Don't worry. Our secret is safe.
-What secret?

04:30.062 --> 04:31.230
The way you look at me.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.899
The way you fantasize about me.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.153
You have a diseased mind, Dr. Harmon.

04:38.904 --> 04:40.864
That must be why you became a therapist.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.908
I'm glad you and my wife are friends,

04:42.991 --> 04:45.953
but I'm not interested in
your pet theories about me.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.706
So, maybe I'm way off base,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.084
or maybe I'm crazy like Vivien.

04:53.877 --> 04:55.754
Is that what you think, Doctor?

04:56.004 --> 04:58.507
I think you must have
pretty low self-esteem,

04:58.757 --> 05:01.760
to keep throwing yourself at a married man
who doesn't want you.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.470
So, you don't want me?

05:04.555 --> 05:05.597
You don't find me attractive?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.892
Just make Violet a sandwich, please.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.602
I don't believe you, Ben.

05:11.728 --> 05:12.813
I know you want me.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.941
No, I don't want this.

05:16.608 --> 05:17.651
I love my wife.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.613
I want her to get better and come home,
so I can take care of her.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.824
I just want a normal,

05:25.075 --> 05:27.286
boring family.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.332
-That's a beautiful speech, Ben.
-It's Dr. Harmon.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.378
No more games. No more bullshit.
Do you understand?

05:38.088 --> 05:39.923
I'd better make Violet a sandwich.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.137
You know, it's just a matter of time, Ben.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.473
"The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak."

06:02.362 --> 06:04.198
-(door opens)
-(dog growling)

06:04.865 --> 06:05.949
Hey.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.119
-Did they all...
-Poo? Uh, yeah.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.704
Oh, all except for that one.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.498
Well, if he shits in the house,
you're cleaning it up.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.544
Damn. Look at the mud you tracked in.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.881
Nice.

06:25.594 --> 06:26.595
You smoked the last one.

06:26.678 --> 06:27.888
My daughter just died,

06:27.971 --> 06:30.557
and you're on my back
about a goddamn cigarette?

06:30.641 --> 06:33.227
Here. Smoke that one, asshole.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.771
I'm not another one of your dogs.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.398
I got a job. I work hard.
I don't want to come over here,

06:38.482 --> 06:39.525
I don't wanna have to work more.

06:39.608 --> 06:44.696
You got a job, reading a script
down at a call center for two hours a day.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.407
Oh, my. Let me rub your feet.

06:47.908 --> 06:52.329
And how did those head shots
that I paid for work out for you?

07:03.215 --> 07:05.884
I'm sorry about Addy.
She was a cool chick.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.846
Ugh! Yeah.
Maybe that's why you used to

07:08.929 --> 07:10.472
come over here early, huh?

07:10.556 --> 07:11.849
Before I got home?

07:11.932 --> 07:15.310
So you could spend (inhales sharply)
a little time diddling her, huh?

07:16.353 --> 07:18.772
Whispering sweet nothings in her ear?

07:18.856 --> 07:20.023
I hate when you drink.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.319
Hey!

07:25.696 --> 07:26.780
What?

07:26.864 --> 07:31.660
Why don't you run on down to the Koreans
and get us another carton of ciggies?

07:31.743 --> 07:32.828
That's where I'm going.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.497
And take that goddamn dog with you.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.416
And don't come back
until he does his business.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.419
(exhales)

07:42.671 --> 07:43.797
(moans)

07:45.299 --> 07:46.300
(door closes)

07:46.800 --> 07:47.801
Come on, buddy.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.138
(wolf whistle)

07:53.056 --> 07:54.099
Is that for me?

07:55.392 --> 07:56.643
For the dog actually.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.313
Where you headed?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.356
The store.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.401
You want me to get you some candy,
little girl?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.486
You're with that lady next door.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.864
She a little old for you?

08:10.282 --> 08:11.992
She seems like a royal bitch.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.368
(sighs)

08:14.328 --> 08:16.246
Maybe you and I should
run away together then.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.497
<i>('60s pop music playing)</i>

08:18.957 --> 08:21.001
-<i>In the cool of the evening</i>
-(moaning)

08:21.084 --> 08:25.214
<i>When everything is getting kind of groovy</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:30.052

<i>If I would like to go</i><i>with you</i>
<i>and see a movie</i>

08:31.803 --> 08:33.055
I came inside.

08:34.431 --> 08:36.391
It's cool. I can't get pregnant.

08:37.601 --> 08:39.645
(panting) Really?

08:39.728 --> 08:41.688
(chuckles) Sweet.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.358
Your mom isn't gonna get pissed?

08:44.441 --> 08:45.776
Freaking hope she does.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.028
Then I'm some sweet revenge.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.572
I'm not gonna tell her.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.159
Then what is the point?

08:55.202 --> 08:57.162
Sex is the only weapon
you have against her.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.957
She's treating you like shit
because she's afraid of losing you.

09:02.084 --> 09:03.836
Prove to her that she's right,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.505
and she'll be
blowing rainbows up your ass again.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.757
I think that I love her.

09:11.927 --> 09:13.136
Hey!

09:14.012 --> 09:16.431
What's your story?
I mean, how come you get to live here?

09:17.307 --> 09:19.393
You know, I heard they took that lady
to the loony bin.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.561
I don't live here yet.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.229
I'm moving in soon though.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.981
Dr. Harmon and I are in love.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.733
(chuckles) Okay.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.944
Then how come you rocked out with me?

09:30.112 --> 09:32.698
To see if I could do it
with a guy who's still alive.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.200
<i>Spooky</i>

09:35.993 --> 09:37.870
-(doorbell rings)
-<i>Spooky</i>

09:37.953 --> 09:39.913
Dr. Harmon, Detective Jack Colquitt.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.623
-Missing Persons, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.543
This young lady believes you might be
involved in a case we just opened.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.589
You don't remember me, Ben?
Marla McClaine. Hayden's sister?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.591
BEN: I honestly have no idea
what happened to her.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.426
In fact,
I have a few questions for her myself.

09:52.551 --> 09:55.012
You're a liar.
Hayden is pregnant with your baby.

09:55.387 --> 09:59.016
And she comes here with the crazy idea
that somehow you're gonna leave your wife,

09:59.099 --> 10:01.393
support her and raise your child together.

10:01.894 --> 10:05.439
So, what'd you do, Ben?
Where is she? In a hole somewhere?

10:05.522 --> 10:07.232
Dr. Harmon, the last time I was here,

10:07.316 --> 10:09.318
I saw Miss McClaine's sister
coming out of the house.

10:09.401 --> 10:12.529
Yes. We made plans
to go to lunch at Norms.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.239
You were also working
in the backyard digging, weren't you,

10:14.323 --> 10:15.490
around the time she disappeared?

10:15.574 --> 10:17.117
Detective, you have no idea
what happened here.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.327
That's what we're here to find out.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.703
What's with all the drama?

10:21.371 --> 10:22.623
MARLA: What the hell, Hayden?

10:23.332 --> 10:26.168
How come you haven't answered your phone
or called or anything?

10:26.251 --> 10:28.295
Uh, to be honest with you, Marla,

10:28.378 --> 10:30.255
I didn't think
you gave a rat's ass about me.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.132
I thought you were calling
to borrow money again.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.801
So, you're okay then?
Obviously you're not missing.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.970
Nope.

10:37.346 --> 10:40.849
You don't have to worry about me, sis.
You were wrong about Ben.

10:41.642 --> 10:45.604
I've decided to stay here in La-La Land.
This is my home now.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.651
(door closes)

10:51.193 --> 10:52.945
You've got about 10 seconds
to give me some answers

10:53.028 --> 10:54.238
before I call that detective back

10:54.321 --> 10:56.240
and have you arrested
for assaulting my family.

10:56.532 --> 10:57.866
I'm sorry, Ben.

10:58.075 --> 11:00.369
I was pregnant, scared and hormonal.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.496
I was a crazy bitch
when I came here on Halloween.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.581
I deserve whatever punishment
you think is right.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.210
Ben, this whole thing has been so ugly.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.587
It's not me.
It's not how I want you to think of me.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.715
I don't know if we have a future together,
but I've always been there for you.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.133
From the beginning.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.344
I just want you to remember that.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.265
By the way,

11:22.391 --> 11:23.600
I had the abortion.

11:24.226 --> 11:26.186
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.108
Dr. Harmon?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.486
Excuse me. Do we have an appointment?

11:34.820 --> 11:37.155
I was told there was a doctor here
who might help me.

11:37.406 --> 11:39.408
You need to call
and make an appointment.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.827
Doctor, I think something
terrible might happen to me.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.955
-What do you mean, "something terrible"?
-I'm not quite certain.

11:45.289 --> 11:46.707
It's a strange feeling.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.292
An endless foreboding.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.878
Like a dream I can't wake myself out of.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.046
Sounds like acute anxiety.
But you really...

11:53.130 --> 11:54.173
It's worse than that.

11:54.756 --> 11:58.510
I do things with men. Things I shouldn't.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.930
But I'm a great actress,
and it's frustrating.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.807
I just need that break.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.894
All you need
is that one person who believes in you.

12:06.977 --> 12:10.981
And every time I go into an audition,
I think maybe he's the one and...

12:12.482 --> 12:13.901
I get carried away and...

12:14.318 --> 12:15.777
-Do you know what I mean?
-I do.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.074
(sighs)

12:25.704 --> 12:28.040
I have an opening tomorrow at noon.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.375
-What's your name?
-Elizabeth Short.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.461
I assume you're covered
by SAG insurance?

12:33.754 --> 12:34.880
I see.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.632
Well, you're a beautiful young girl.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.550
I just assumed that
you were working steadily.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.428
In the meantime, we need to discuss
how you plan to pay for treatment.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.808
Do you really think I'm beautiful?

12:47.643 --> 12:48.685
Really?

12:48.769 --> 12:52.397
You're, um,
an attractive young woman.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.237
No, no, no, no, Beth.
(stutters) We just discussed that.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.321
You don't need to do that.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.031
But I don't know how else to pay you.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.367
I know you're the one who can help me.

13:04.159 --> 13:06.078
I can tell. You understand.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.372
Well, we can figure something out.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.461
You never need to do that with me.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.716
I'm the one you should feel safe with.

13:28.559 --> 13:29.768
(phone vibrating)

13:30.978 --> 13:31.979
Excuse me.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.774
Uh, I need to... I need to get this.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.860
-You won't regret this.
-Hello?

13:37.943 --> 13:40.696
Uh, just slow down, Doctor.
I can't... I can't understand you.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.197
I spoke with Vivien's psychiatrist,

13:42.281 --> 13:45.701
and he doesn't feel she's mentally
strong enough to hear this news right now.

13:45.784 --> 13:49.288
Normally, I would be very uncomfortable
giving a husband this information,

13:49.371 --> 13:51.915
but you are her designated
health care proxy.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.042
Would you just tell me
what's going on, Doctor?

13:54.126 --> 13:56.128
Heteropaternal superfecundation.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.254
Hetero-what?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.631
Your wife's twins have different fathers.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.466
I'm sorry.

14:01.550 --> 14:02.593
What did you say?

14:02.759 --> 14:05.637
It's extremely rare.
Maybe one in a million.

14:05.846 --> 14:09.600
Your wife must have had
intercourse with two different men

14:09.725 --> 14:13.604
during the same ovulation cycle,
within a 48-hour period.

14:21.987 --> 14:24.573
-Where is she? Little slut.
-Who?

14:24.656 --> 14:25.657
Violet.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.076
She's been catting around
with my dog walker.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.328
Nonsense.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.873
The girl's taste in men is hardly refined,
but I doubt it runs to rough trade.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.459
Well, when Travis came back
from dog walking,

14:35.542 --> 14:39.129
a 15-minute affair
that somehow stretched into 45,

14:39.713 --> 14:43.091
he smelled of something other than canine.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.259
You're delusional.

14:45.010 --> 14:48.055
That girl wouldn't give
your greasy boy toy a second glance.

14:48.514 --> 14:51.892
She thinks she's in love
with your little angel.

14:52.226 --> 14:54.978
But once the truth comes out,
I suspect that'll change.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.898
What the hell are you babbling about?

14:58.023 --> 14:59.691
The two babies her mother is carrying,

15:00.692 --> 15:03.153
only one of them
was fathered by Dr. Harmon.

15:08.825 --> 15:09.826
Tate?

15:12.037 --> 15:15.082
Tate, honey, it's Mama.
I have to talk to you.

15:15.666 --> 15:16.792
Tate?

15:17.835 --> 15:18.877
-Tate?
-So talk.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.713
Oh! Oh, God.

15:22.548 --> 15:26.844
Tell me it isn't true,
what I've been hearing about you.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.388
-About what?
-Your behavior.

15:31.098 --> 15:35.561
God, after all the missteps,
we finally have somebody in this house

15:36.019 --> 15:37.938
that maybe can help you.

15:40.023 --> 15:44.528
Tell me you did not crawl
on top of that man's wife.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.408
Oh.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.619
Mama. Mama, you can't tell Violet, okay?
Please don't...

15:53.579 --> 15:56.331
What is wrong with you, for God sakes?

15:56.415 --> 15:58.667
-What's wrong with you?
-Mama!

15:58.750 --> 16:01.545
Don't you realize
what you've done?

16:01.628 --> 16:03.463
(wails) Mama!

16:08.844 --> 16:10.095
(moans)

16:12.723 --> 16:13.765
Come play, Ben.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.185
Come, Ben.

16:17.686 --> 16:18.979
Please?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.611
(moaning)

16:29.615 --> 16:30.741
BETH: <i>Ben.</i>

16:32.993 --> 16:34.036
<i>Come on, Ben.</i>

16:39.416 --> 16:40.459
Get out.

16:41.919 --> 16:44.338
Elizabeth, put your clothes on and leave.

16:44.630 --> 16:46.548
I'm sorry, but I can't treat you anymore.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.595
You're not really gonna
turn this down, are you?

16:51.678 --> 16:53.889
And you're fired.
Sue me if you need to.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.099
Make your last chore to show her out.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.563
You said this would work.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.398
You said this is what he wanted.

17:03.482 --> 17:04.816
HAYDEN: She's using you, honey.

17:13.283 --> 17:14.493
(sobs)

17:16.787 --> 17:18.914
My dreams will never come true.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.374
Your dreams?

17:22.459 --> 17:26.046
I know it sounds terribly selfish,
but I must become famous.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.257
It's the only thing I've ever wanted.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.093
Honey, don't you know who you are?

17:31.176 --> 17:32.302
I'm Elizabeth Short.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.263
You really don't know, do you?

17:35.514 --> 17:36.682
<i>(jazzy blues music playing)</i>

17:37.224 --> 17:39.768
-(gas hissing)
-(grunting)

17:43.856 --> 17:44.898
(zipper zips)

17:57.828 --> 17:59.162
God, you're beautiful.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.792
Now, let's look at those teeth.

18:05.294 --> 18:07.713
-(whirring)
-(clears throat)

18:08.797 --> 18:09.882
Beth?

18:12.926 --> 18:14.052
Beth.

18:15.095 --> 18:16.221
God!

18:17.556 --> 18:18.640
(sobs)

18:25.731 --> 18:27.024
(footsteps approaching)

18:27.774 --> 18:30.319
-Who are you?
-My name is Charles Montgomery.

18:30.694 --> 18:34.031
I am quite a renowned surgeon.
I'm here to help you.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.910
(inhales)

18:41.121 --> 18:42.164
(inhales)

18:49.087 --> 18:51.840
(humming)

18:52.299 --> 18:53.717
(inhales)

18:53.800 --> 18:55.135
(humming continues)

18:59.139 --> 19:00.140
What have you done?

19:01.058 --> 19:02.184
I've bisected her body,

19:02.684 --> 19:04.811
removed the intestines
and drained her blood.

19:04.895 --> 19:07.606
-Why?
-A writer writes, a surgeon cuts.

19:07.898 --> 19:10.901
I think you will find
these pieces more portable.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.653
What are you doing now?

19:13.111 --> 19:14.655
Well, she seemed so sad.

19:15.072 --> 19:18.492
I've decided to give her a smile
that will last forever.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.787
That's how they found me.

19:22.746 --> 19:26.041
Naked, on display
for the whole world to see.

19:26.291 --> 19:29.294
You were the front-page news
of every paper for two months.

19:30.879 --> 19:31.922
(sighs)

19:33.757 --> 19:36.176
I really did become somebody.

19:37.553 --> 19:41.431
She's been extremely agitated,
and the paranoia hasn't abated.

19:41.515 --> 19:44.434
I'm sure the doctor
will change up the meds when he gets here,

19:44.518 --> 19:47.729
but, in the meantime,
we've had to keep her restrained.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.439
Restrained?

19:49.773 --> 19:51.525
She attacked one of the orderlies.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.862
He suggested
that this rapist in a rubber suit

19:54.945 --> 19:57.489
was some kind of sexual fantasy.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.492
-(door opens)
-NURSE: Vivien.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.119
You have a visitor.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.084
(door closes)

20:13.672 --> 20:15.007
(sighs)

20:15.132 --> 20:17.885
I know you can't
carry on a conversation right now.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.722
That's okay.
I know what you're thinking.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.724
You're thinking,
"Thank God he's here.

20:24.016 --> 20:27.811
"Thank God he can see
what they're doing to me. How wrong it is.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.190
"And thank God he's a shrink,
so he can get me out of here."

20:32.316 --> 20:33.859
You're right.

20:35.611 --> 20:36.778
You're in hell here.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.073
This is no place for my wife.

20:40.574 --> 20:44.703
And I'd move heaven and earth
for the Vivien I thought I was married to.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.789
But you aren't her.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.791
You're a stranger to me.

20:52.461 --> 20:54.171
You actually pretended,

20:54.421 --> 20:56.757
maybe even believed, like a sociopath,

20:56.840 --> 20:59.718
that you were some kind
of holy saint without sin,

20:59.801 --> 21:02.054
while you shit all over me,

21:03.472 --> 21:06.391
our life and our family

21:06.808 --> 21:09.228
with betrayal and lies.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.606
The way I feel right now,

21:14.107 --> 21:16.443
I wouldn't lift a finger
to help you get out of here.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.117
(door opens)

21:25.994 --> 21:27.037
(door closes)

21:32.459 --> 21:34.294
-Mmm.
-(music playing on jukebox)

21:34.378 --> 21:35.796
God, I miss college.

21:36.797 --> 21:40.759
Enjoy it before real life
just knocks you on your ass.

21:40.968 --> 21:43.512
-Do you want to talk about it?
-Nope. I don't.

21:47.766 --> 21:48.767
I miss beer.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.603
Vivien hates it when I drink.
Especially beer.

21:51.854 --> 21:54.857
-I like beer.
-Mmm! There you go.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.485
-Can I confess something to you?
-Hmm.

21:58.861 --> 22:01.196
I think the smart answer
would have to be no.

22:02.573 --> 22:05.450
I'm not really confused
about interpersonal aggression.

22:05.534 --> 22:06.952
-You're not?
-Mmm-mmm.

22:07.035 --> 22:10.956
That's a shame because I could tell you
a lot about interpersonal aggression.

22:13.584 --> 22:16.879
My marriage for one thing.
Not in a happy place right now.

22:18.714 --> 22:20.299
See? You do want to talk about it.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.508
I don't. I just want to...

22:21.592 --> 22:25.888
I just want to drink
and get drunk and stumble home on the "T."

22:29.391 --> 22:32.519
The thing is, Dr. Harmon,

22:34.396 --> 22:35.606
I have a crush on you.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.441
(chuckles)

22:40.152 --> 22:41.278
That's a bad move.

22:41.361 --> 22:45.199
Seriously. I mean, you're gonna have
so many men in your life.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.326
(chuckles) What does that mean?

22:47.409 --> 22:48.535
It means you're a knockout.

22:49.870 --> 22:52.372
-You're smart as hell.
-Is hell smart?

22:52.623 --> 22:55.959
(chuckles) Oh, whoa, whoa.
Listen to this guitar solo.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.295
-I mean, it's incredible.
-(guitar solo)

23:00.506 --> 23:01.632
(chuckles)

23:02.174 --> 23:03.550
(music continues)

23:07.471 --> 23:09.139
It was written in the stars

23:11.308 --> 23:12.518
that I was meant to take your class

23:12.768 --> 23:14.603
right at the moment
your marriage imploded.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.732
-You needed me, Ben.
-I did.

23:20.859 --> 23:23.904
I did need you.
But I shouldn't have crossed the line.

23:24.154 --> 23:25.989
-Ben...
-I abused my authority.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.285
I was a consenting adult.

23:31.912 --> 23:33.038
I still am.

23:33.872 --> 23:38.126
Hayden, please, listen to me.
My marriage was a mess when we met.

23:38.335 --> 23:41.421
And now? It's even worse, Ben.

23:42.089 --> 23:45.050
You're right. It's bad. It's really bad.

23:45.551 --> 23:48.178
But here's the thing, Hayden,
and I hope you understand this.

23:49.805 --> 23:52.307
We weren't written in the stars.

23:53.392 --> 23:56.687
We're not meant to be together.
Not then, not now,

23:56.979 --> 23:58.689
-not six months from now.
-Ben...

23:58.772 --> 24:01.984
I was lonely,
I was heartbroken, and I used you.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.194
It was unforgivable. I'm sorry.

24:04.987 --> 24:09.491
But no matter what happens with my wife,
I can't be with you.

24:12.578 --> 24:13.620
I don't love you, Hayden.

24:15.372 --> 24:18.208
I'm sorry. I never did.

24:19.585 --> 24:20.586
You don't love me?

24:23.839 --> 24:25.090
You don't love me.

24:27.634 --> 24:28.677
Okay.

24:32.890 --> 24:35.058
-Could I have a hug?
-Of course.

24:48.822 --> 24:50.657
Hayden, come on. It's over.

24:51.116 --> 24:52.534
You can't just hang around here.

24:52.618 --> 24:54.328
I'm not just hanging around here.

24:55.579 --> 24:56.747
I came for a reason.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.835
When it concerns your family,
you have a right to know.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.589
-What are you talking about?
-Vivien and that black guy.

25:06.548 --> 25:07.883
You know, in the uniform.

25:07.966 --> 25:10.511
I came around here the other morning,
and he was leaving.

25:11.136 --> 25:13.138
Who knows how long
it's been going on.

25:14.348 --> 25:15.390
Just thought you should know.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.896
CONSTANCE: Travis.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.106
I need to talk to you, honey.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.109
-You mean yell at me some more?
-On the contrary,

25:26.401 --> 25:30.906
I want to apologize for my earlier manner.
It was unnecessarily cruel.

25:32.157 --> 25:34.117
You know, you've been going through
a lot of stuff lately, so...

25:34.201 --> 25:38.497
Yeah, it's true, I have,
but so have you, here by my side.

25:39.957 --> 25:45.254
Oh, and don't think
it hasn't gone unnoticed or unappreciated.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.215
-(chuckles)
-Hmm.

25:48.465 --> 25:52.594
You know, in many ways
you are a fine man, Travis.

25:53.637 --> 25:58.225
So, sit down, baby.
I want to ask you something.

25:59.518 --> 26:00.602
Okay.

26:03.522 --> 26:05.732
-What do you want to ask me?
-(chuckles)

26:07.192 --> 26:08.277
Will you marry me?

26:08.777 --> 26:11.697
(laughs) Marry you?

26:11.780 --> 26:14.491
Listen to me.
There's going to be a child.

26:14.992 --> 26:17.202
And I want to bring
that child into this home

26:17.286 --> 26:19.204
and raise it as my own.

26:20.163 --> 26:21.206
What child?

26:21.456 --> 26:23.292
Our child.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.670
Or it could be. We could be a family.

26:26.879 --> 26:30.299
I won't make the same mistakes
that I made the last time.

26:30.424 --> 26:32.301
You would be a wonderful father.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.346
Father? Whoa.

26:36.430 --> 26:39.725
-Um, I'm not ready to be a father.
-Oh, but you are.

26:40.058 --> 26:43.562
I've seen how you were
with Addy and with the dogs.

26:44.229 --> 26:46.273
With Addy and the dogs, it...

26:48.817 --> 26:50.569
-What about my career?
-Your what?

26:50.736 --> 26:51.904
My career, you know.

26:51.987 --> 26:54.281
Maybe... I don't know.
Maybe we should wait

26:54.364 --> 26:58.035
and let me get myself established
and then we could do whatever, you know?

26:58.118 --> 27:00.078
What career? What?

27:00.162 --> 27:02.706
This dream you have

27:02.873 --> 27:08.378
of appearing half naked in your skivvies
60 feet high above Times Square?

27:08.462 --> 27:10.047
I don't know why that's so funny to you.

27:10.130 --> 27:13.884
I know that dream. I had that dream!

27:14.718 --> 27:18.639
I was gonna be a big star, and, baby,
if it didn't happen for me,

27:18.972 --> 27:21.475
it is not going to happen for you.

27:23.769 --> 27:26.271
-Why are you being so mean?
-I am being honest.

27:26.355 --> 27:27.356
No, you're being mean.

27:27.439 --> 27:31.944
A lean torso in this town
is a dime a dozen, baby,

27:32.027 --> 27:33.820
and that's all you've got.

27:34.112 --> 27:37.866
I'm offering reality, community property,

27:38.075 --> 27:41.662
a chance to be somebody, a father.

27:42.079 --> 27:44.248
I mean, look at you.
What are you now? You're nothing.

27:44.915 --> 27:46.625
No, I am something.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.211
And just because you say
that I'm not gonna make it

27:49.294 --> 27:52.589
-doesn't mean it's true.
-Oh, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!

27:54.174 --> 27:57.302
God, how could I have ever
thought you could be a father?

27:58.053 --> 28:01.014
You are not even a man.

28:01.473 --> 28:03.976
-Oh, come on...
-Oh, don't you dare!

28:04.351 --> 28:06.186
You'd better be careful.
You know why?

28:06.603 --> 28:11.233
Because the last man
who thought that he could strike me

28:12.693 --> 28:14.444
came to a very unpleasant end,

28:15.654 --> 28:17.406
and he was a man.

28:24.913 --> 28:26.123
(door opens and closes)

28:26.206 --> 28:28.417
TRAVIS (grunting): She said

28:29.084 --> 28:30.085
that I wasn't a man.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.880
She said I'd never be famous.

28:33.255 --> 28:35.632
Oh! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

28:35.716 --> 28:37.467
Oh! (panting)

28:43.891 --> 28:45.017
Feel better?

28:46.143 --> 28:47.144
Yeah.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.229
I don't.

28:49.980 --> 28:51.815
He said we weren't meant to be together.

28:52.858 --> 28:53.901
We were meant to be.

28:53.984 --> 28:56.820
-(panting)
-Let's go again.

28:56.904 --> 28:58.238
(panting)

28:58.322 --> 28:59.448
What are you doing?

28:59.531 --> 29:00.824
I totally thought you came.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.534
-No.
-Really?

29:03.952 --> 29:07.998
Look, uh, would you mind
finishing yourself?

29:08.081 --> 29:10.375
(panting) I really gotta go.

29:10.459 --> 29:12.127
I mean, I can't leave it like this
with Constance.

29:12.211 --> 29:14.505
You're kidding me.
I thought you said you hated her.

29:14.588 --> 29:16.798
No. I guess I love her.

29:17.341 --> 29:20.344
-And we got a baby coming.
-A baby what? Fossil?

29:20.427 --> 29:22.513
I don't know.
I guess we're gonna adopt.

29:22.596 --> 29:24.473
After all that shit she said to you?

29:25.349 --> 29:27.392
I'm gonna come back. I promise.

29:30.312 --> 29:31.396
Can I at least get a hug?

29:32.439 --> 29:35.108
Yeah. I had a really good time.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.030
-(flesh ripping)
-(groaning)

29:42.074 --> 29:44.284
Shit! (groans)

29:47.579 --> 29:50.123
-(yells)
-(sobbing) Ow!

29:50.207 --> 29:52.084
(gasping)

29:53.710 --> 29:55.671
(pants)

29:58.048 --> 29:59.842
I had a really great time too.

30:10.269 --> 30:12.729
Well, shit, now what
am I gonna do with you?

30:13.438 --> 30:16.650
Whoa. Constance was right.

30:17.109 --> 30:18.902
Now I'm never gonna be famous.

30:20.821 --> 30:22.489
That's not necessarily true.

30:22.906 --> 30:25.492
In fact, now you might even
have a better chance.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.786
The only one who's gonna be
famous out of this is Ben,

30:27.870 --> 30:29.580
when they find the body down here.

30:29.663 --> 30:33.125
They'll send him to prison.
Or he'll move out.

30:33.542 --> 30:34.710
God damn it.

30:34.793 --> 30:37.337
Who's to say the body
has to be found here?

30:37.504 --> 30:39.590
What, are you gonna drag him
out of here, Casper?

30:40.132 --> 30:43.635
Well, if you know someone who might,
I could certainly make it easier.

30:45.429 --> 30:47.181
There is someone who owes me a favor.

30:49.808 --> 30:50.893
MAN: Oh!

30:50.976 --> 30:52.227
Whoo!

31:04.072 --> 31:05.199
Holy shit.

31:06.783 --> 31:09.995
Holy shit. Yo! Yo!
Yo, come over here!

31:15.083 --> 31:16.251
What?

31:16.585 --> 31:17.878
Holy shit.

31:19.004 --> 31:20.589
Holy shit, yo!

31:25.010 --> 31:26.345
(camera shutter clicks)

31:46.406 --> 31:47.616
(sighs)

31:51.537 --> 31:53.163
-(knocking)
-Knock, knock.

31:54.665 --> 31:57.918
My dear, look at you.

31:59.294 --> 32:04.174
Even this hideous place
can't dim your charming, girlish spirit.

32:04.341 --> 32:06.635
Hello, Constance. What a surprise.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.637
Well, I hope it is a good one.
(chuckles)

32:09.930 --> 32:12.224
You know, I've been thinking
about you so much

32:12.307 --> 32:15.978
and about this ordeal
that you've been through.

32:16.061 --> 32:18.730
And being pregnant
on top of everything else.

32:20.107 --> 32:21.733
My goodness, that poor baby.

32:21.817 --> 32:23.193
Babies. It's twins.

32:23.277 --> 32:26.196
Oh, of course. Babies.

32:27.614 --> 32:30.993
And is everything all right
with the babies?

32:31.201 --> 32:32.953
They're growing very fast.

32:34.246 --> 32:36.331
I can't believe how much food
I've been consuming.

32:36.415 --> 32:38.876
-Even in here, I'm just ravenous.
-That's a good thing.

32:39.376 --> 32:43.005
Oh, Vivien, Vivien, I want you to know

32:44.047 --> 32:45.757
that I intend to be there for you,

32:46.466 --> 32:47.718
whatever help you need.

32:49.887 --> 32:50.971
I mean, babies are my thing.

32:51.054 --> 32:52.472
I have a special gift.

32:52.764 --> 32:54.349
And I've been a single mother.

32:54.433 --> 32:59.605
I mean, I know how we tell ourselves
that we don't need a man.

32:59.938 --> 33:02.149
We can do it alone.
But the secret, Vivien?

33:03.483 --> 33:05.068
The secret is community.

33:05.903 --> 33:06.987
Sisterhood.

33:08.238 --> 33:11.200
Constance, I don't want to
be rude or seem ungrateful.

33:11.283 --> 33:12.451
I am just so tired,

33:12.534 --> 33:15.204
and I just, probably from the meds,
I need to nap.

33:15.287 --> 33:18.624
Of course, honey.
Oh, I'll just disappear. (chuckles)

33:19.750 --> 33:20.751
Vivien, you know,

33:21.001 --> 33:24.922
I know the pain
of being doubted by everyone around you.

33:29.218 --> 33:30.802
It ravages the soul.

33:36.558 --> 33:37.559
Well, those are for you.

33:39.102 --> 33:40.187
Thank you.

33:40.270 --> 33:42.689
I think I might stop by
at Sweet Lady Jane's

33:44.191 --> 33:46.777
and pick up some pastry
for that sweet little Violet.

33:46.860 --> 33:47.903
Constance.

33:52.824 --> 33:53.867
I was raped.

33:57.996 --> 33:59.915
I didn't hallucinate any of it.

34:00.582 --> 34:02.000
Well, of course not.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.295
Oh, honey,
I never doubted it for a minute.

34:05.462 --> 34:07.339
Please don't tell anybody that I told you

34:07.422 --> 34:09.800
because I need for them to think
that I'm coming to my senses

34:09.883 --> 34:11.677
so that I can get out of here.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.011
Of course.

34:15.222 --> 34:16.640
You poor thing.

34:19.059 --> 34:20.352
What you've been through.

34:20.811 --> 34:22.688
-(alarm blaring)
-(door opens)

34:25.858 --> 34:26.859
(door closes)

34:32.489 --> 34:33.532
(alarm stops)

34:33.824 --> 34:36.410
You didn't have to trigger
the alarm system to get me over here.

34:37.077 --> 34:38.996
I've been racking my brains
trying to figure it out.

34:40.956 --> 34:42.499
I gotta hand it to you both.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.335
It was a terrific cover.

34:47.045 --> 34:48.297
-I'm lost here.
-Where'd you meet her?

34:48.380 --> 34:50.966
At Whole Foods? At the gym?

34:51.300 --> 34:53.177
I installed
your security system, remember?

34:53.302 --> 34:55.804
We moved here in early fall.

34:56.805 --> 34:59.933
You met Vivien...whenever.

35:00.017 --> 35:01.518
Started having an affair.

35:02.728 --> 35:03.937
-Got her pregnant.
-What?

35:04.021 --> 35:06.899
She's having twins,
and only one of them is mine.

35:09.818 --> 35:14.740
(exhales) Okay.
So I guess the other one must be mine.

35:15.240 --> 35:19.077
Look, I'm not asking you
for child support.

35:19.161 --> 35:21.121
In fact, you're not even
gonna see this baby.

35:21.413 --> 35:24.458
I just want to hear it from you,
man to man.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.419
All right. Man to man.

35:29.254 --> 35:30.255
Hear this, Ben.

35:31.048 --> 35:34.301
If that was my baby,
you couldn't keep me away.

35:34.718 --> 35:36.887
But the sad fact is,
is that I'm shooting blanks.

35:37.429 --> 35:40.057
You can ask my ex-wife.
We tried for five years.

35:40.307 --> 35:41.642
All it takes is one good swimmer.

35:41.725 --> 35:44.520
Look, I don't know Vivien that well.

35:45.062 --> 35:47.231
But clearly she has been
a very busy girl.

35:47.439 --> 35:49.399
Hey, don't talk about my wife like that.

35:49.525 --> 35:51.026
-You don't know her.
-And you do?

35:53.403 --> 35:56.323
You called her a whore and a liar.

35:57.407 --> 35:58.825
That was just in the last five minutes.

36:00.244 --> 36:03.205
Your own wife,
you locked her away, Ben.

36:07.876 --> 36:08.919
You know what?

36:10.838 --> 36:13.882
Maybe it's good.
Maybe she's safer there.

36:20.722 --> 36:22.057
(door opens and closes)

36:28.063 --> 36:29.189
Kinky.

36:30.899 --> 36:32.317
You want me to try that on?

36:32.442 --> 36:34.444
Looks like you went to
a lot of trouble to find it.

36:34.987 --> 36:36.154
What do you know about this?

36:36.405 --> 36:39.992
I know I get wet just thinking about
sliding that rubber on my body.

36:40.075 --> 36:43.120
Stop it.
Stop your bullshit and listen to me.

36:43.203 --> 36:45.581
You're in this house all the time.
You see everything.

36:45.664 --> 36:47.791
-What happened with Vivien?
-Why do you care?

36:48.208 --> 36:50.669
You're a man.
Isn't this what all men want?

36:51.420 --> 36:54.798
The freedom to satiate
their needs guilt-free?

36:54.882 --> 36:56.216
Just tell me the truth.

36:58.177 --> 37:00.470
I think I made a horrible mistake
by putting Vivien in the hospital.

37:02.014 --> 37:03.807
She was attacked by someone.

37:10.689 --> 37:12.316
Congratulations, Dr. Harmon.

37:23.368 --> 37:25.579
You're finally beginning
to see things as they are.

37:31.668 --> 37:32.836
(door closes)

37:34.213 --> 37:37.382
I think we're gonna get a pickup
on my lifetime pilot.

37:38.258 --> 37:40.636
And as soon as we do,
I want to bring you on as my guest.

37:42.429 --> 37:46.558
I can't focus on your career right now.

37:47.184 --> 37:50.812
I may be looking at a rather
earth-shattering situation.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.689
Could we be talking menopause baby?

37:54.441 --> 37:56.109
Why am I seeing baby pictures?

37:57.194 --> 37:58.278
Tell me.

38:01.657 --> 38:04.618
What happens when a human

38:05.744 --> 38:08.163
copulates with someone
from the spirit world?

38:08.914 --> 38:11.166
Spirits aren't known for their potency.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.543
Yes, but...

38:14.002 --> 38:18.257
What if there is, in fact, a conception?

38:19.758 --> 38:21.134
You do know about the box.

38:23.178 --> 38:24.596
The pope's box?

38:24.680 --> 38:26.473
What the hell are you talking about?

38:29.184 --> 38:31.228
When a new pope has been chosen,

38:32.229 --> 38:34.565
and the bells of St. Peter's chime,

38:34.648 --> 38:38.110
-(bells tolling)
-he is shown into a small chamber

38:38.193 --> 38:39.820
next to the Sistine Chapel.

38:40.362 --> 38:42.614
They call it the room of tears,

38:42.698 --> 38:46.618
named for the sublime mixture
of joy and sorrow

38:46.994 --> 38:49.329
that he must contemplate at this moment.

38:49.788 --> 38:51.707
He is brought a key to this box.

38:52.749 --> 38:55.169
It has been said
that this box contains

38:55.460 --> 38:56.670
the ultimate secret.

38:57.546 --> 39:01.800
It holds the secret
of the end of the world.

39:02.885 --> 39:04.094
Well, for Christ's sake,

39:04.178 --> 39:06.138
Billie Dean,
the cameras aren't rolling in here.

39:06.221 --> 39:07.681
Will you just cut to the chase?

39:07.764 --> 39:11.852
This piece of paper reveals
the precise nature of the Antichrist.

39:14.771 --> 39:18.192
"A child born of human and spirit

39:18.400 --> 39:20.277
"will usher in the end of times."

39:23.155 --> 39:25.324
It is the essence of evil.

39:27.492 --> 39:29.828
A perversion of the immaculate conception.

39:31.413 --> 39:32.456
What are you talking about?

39:32.539 --> 39:33.957
Oh, come on, honey.

39:34.791 --> 39:38.337
The Holy Ghost
merely whispered in the Virgin Mary's ear,

39:38.420 --> 39:39.755
and she begat the son of God.

39:41.965 --> 39:45.385
If the devil's going to use
a human womb for his spawn,

39:46.303 --> 39:48.931
he's going to want
a little more bang for his buck.
