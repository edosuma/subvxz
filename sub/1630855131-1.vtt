WEBVTT

00:15.708 --> 00:18.500
(ominous music)

00:48.083 --> 00:49.208
- Thanks.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.750
Thanks for waiting.

00:54.333 --> 00:57.583
(car faintly honks)

01:09.916 --> 01:15.208
My therapist thinks that I
should stop talking to you.

01:19.291 --> 01:23.000
Which is confusing because she's the one

01:23.000 --> 01:26.125
who suggested I start talking
to you in the first place.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.583
She thinks that I can't move on.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.333
I need you.

01:48.916 --> 01:50.500
And I know that you need me.

01:55.000 --> 01:55.875
So...

01:59.750 --> 02:02.416
I'm just gonna have to
find another therapist.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.416
(car beeps)

02:12.666 --> 02:13.583
Ready?

02:21.125 --> 02:24.041
Um, he was apparently dating
some girl at the time who,

02:24.166 --> 02:27.125
whenever they would get in
an argument, she'd be like,

02:27.250 --> 02:30.208
"Well, you've never even seen Casablanca"

02:30.375 --> 02:32.416
As if that was some sort
of like a pre-requisite

02:32.583 --> 02:34.291
for being in a relationship.

02:35.125 --> 02:36.291
And I was just there that day

02:36.416 --> 02:37.583
because I had family in town

02:37.750 --> 02:40.250
and I needed to escape for a few hours.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.541
But every time we would get in a fight

02:43.666 --> 02:46.083
he would just look at me and go,

02:46.208 --> 02:47.791
"Here's looking at you, kid."

02:51.958 --> 02:55.375
(calming choral music)

02:57.041 --> 02:58.916
- [Emory] And listen, I know
you haven't felt up to it,

02:59.041 --> 03:02.583
but it is so important that
you keep your audience engaged.

03:02.708 --> 03:04.125
They're worried about you.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.458
You need to share your process.

03:06.583 --> 03:07.833
Remember who you are.

03:07.958 --> 03:08.666
- [Faye] Mhm.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.208
- [Emory] You're Faye fuckin' Ryan.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.125
Say it with me, you invented the new TLC.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.500
TL-

03:14.625 --> 03:15.458
- TLSC.

03:15.625 --> 03:16.541
- [Emory] Tender-

03:16.666 --> 03:18.333
- Tender Love and Self Care.

03:18.458 --> 03:19.708
(Faye chuckles)

03:19.833 --> 03:23.875
T-L-S-C.

03:25.000 --> 03:25.875
(Faye laughs)

03:26.000 --> 03:27.291
- [Emory] I hate to do this to you.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.875
You know we all love
you here at Lighthouse,

03:29.000 --> 03:31.500
and we really want to
continue publishing your work.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.458
But sweetie, if you can't
get me a first draft

03:34.583 --> 03:37.125
or at least the first three chapters

03:37.250 --> 03:38.750
by the end of the month,

03:38.916 --> 03:41.541
then I'm afraid we're
gonna have to drop you.

03:42.333 --> 03:44.500
- Wow, okay.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.291
I thought I had 'til March.

03:48.916 --> 03:50.750
- [Emory] I know what we should do.

03:50.875 --> 03:51.625
I have a plan.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.041
Look, I have a family cabin

03:53.166 --> 03:54.500
that we never use this time of year,

03:54.666 --> 03:56.458
it's in Louisiana, on the bayou.

03:56.583 --> 03:58.250
It has everything you need.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.875
I'll make sure it's stocked for a week.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
What do you say?

04:01.125 --> 04:02.916
Faye, you need to get out of town!

04:03.625 --> 04:05.208
- I used to love driving.

04:05.375 --> 04:09.875
Every Saturday morning, when
Jacob and I first got married,

04:10.041 --> 04:11.083
we would go golfing,

04:11.208 --> 04:13.875
and I would just take a drive.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.166
It honestly didn't even
matter where I was going,

04:16.291 --> 04:18.041
I could be aimless.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.333
I would roll down the windows

04:19.458 --> 04:21.958
and blare my favorite music

04:22.083 --> 04:25.916
that Jacob thought was
obnoxious, but that I loved.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.666
I would stop at a fast food restaurant

04:29.833 --> 04:33.416
and get french fries and just drive.

04:36.041 --> 04:36.916
I loved it.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.500
Now I hate it.

04:48.625 --> 04:51.458
(Faye vomits)

05:02.166 --> 05:05.583
(plucky country music)

05:13.625 --> 05:14.708
Hey, everybody.

05:14.875 --> 05:17.375
You know, I've been pretty quiet on here,

05:18.333 --> 05:21.083
but I just wanted to tell you that

05:21.333 --> 05:24.541
I really appreciate all of your messages

05:24.666 --> 05:26.125
and I'm still here.

05:27.291 --> 05:32.125
And I just got to this amazing place,

05:32.875 --> 05:35.916
'cause I'm going to be getting
back to writing this week,

05:36.041 --> 05:37.583
so stay tuned.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.041
Oh.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.333
Score!

05:42.458 --> 05:45.375
And I have a porch swing, so,

05:46.208 --> 05:47.708
everything's gonna be fine.

05:49.125 --> 05:52.583
(plucky country music)

06:04.916 --> 06:08.958
(construction tools buzzing)

06:12.333 --> 06:13.458
Cool.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.875
Hey, guys.

06:16.625 --> 06:19.166
Oh, hey, Joe, Randy.

06:19.291 --> 06:25.625
Thanks for coming to my
peaceful writing retreat.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.750
Come over for dinner, I'm makin’ gumbo.

06:31.416 --> 06:33.625
Just kidding, I don't know how to cook.

06:36.375 --> 06:39.000
(door creaks)

06:44.208 --> 06:45.125
Wow.

07:13.416 --> 07:14.500
Ugh.

07:21.458 --> 07:22.541
Oh, Lord.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.625
(catchy dark music)

07:48.916 --> 07:50.666
So, when I was 10 years old,

07:50.791 --> 07:53.166
I was sitting in church with my family,

07:53.333 --> 07:55.875
and when the entire congregation

07:55.875 --> 07:58.500
bowed their heads to
pray, I remember thinking,

07:58.791 --> 08:03.833
"Why are we looking down when we pray?

08:03.833 --> 08:07.125
Like, isn't that where the devil lives?"

08:12.333 --> 08:13.666
What the fuck?

08:14.500 --> 08:17.125
I mean, it's kinda cool, but why?

08:22.750 --> 08:24.000
Okay, Emory.

08:25.666 --> 08:28.208
Don't have any of my other books. Cool.

08:29.333 --> 08:34.208
It's not like I've been a
best seller three times.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.041
No thanks.

08:38.208 --> 08:41.458
(lawnmower revs)

08:41.583 --> 08:43.083
Wow, guys.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.958
Really going to town over there.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.833
If we're talking to God, why
aren't we looking up at him?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.375
So then, I made this agreement

08:57.500 --> 08:59.708
that every time I closed my eye,

08:59.833 --> 09:02.666
or like I blinked, I would look up at God.

09:02.791 --> 09:05.458
It would be like I was, you know saying

09:05.458 --> 09:08.166
all of these little miniature
prayers throughout the day.

09:08.291 --> 09:14.375
So, yeah, every time I
blinked, I'd look up at God,

09:14.375 --> 09:18.125
and it turns out you blink
a lot during the day.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.125
So then I was like okay,

09:19.250 --> 09:21.083
I'm going to make this easier on myself.

09:21.208 --> 09:24.541
Every time I blink and
swallow at the same time,

09:24.666 --> 09:26.291
that's when I look up at God.

09:26.416 --> 09:31.458
So then it became this thing,

09:31.583 --> 09:33.625
and I developed a tic,

09:33.750 --> 09:35.833
and then my mom told me
that I was making people

09:36.000 --> 09:37.416
feel uncomfortable when I was doing it

09:37.541 --> 09:40.208
and also she told me it wasn't pretty.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.375
So, she obviously didn't know

09:43.500 --> 09:45.541
I was trying to ensure my salvation.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.916
(catchy dark music)

10:01.666 --> 10:03.625
You're just a bitch.

10:05.833 --> 10:08.000
You're a hateful bitch.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.083
I have OCD.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.875
(calming music)

10:41.541 --> 10:43.041
Chapter...

10:44.750 --> 10:46.250
One.

10:48.208 --> 10:53.416
♪ What you mean to me, to me ♪

10:54.916 --> 10:58.375
♪ But it's not that easy ♪

11:04.541 --> 11:07.750
- Remember that time that
we went to the Everglades?

11:07.875 --> 11:10.875
Yeah, that was fun.

11:11.625 --> 11:14.791
This place kinda reminds me
of that, don't you think?

11:20.875 --> 11:22.750
Do we have a ghost?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.875
Piece of shit.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.041
(phone buzzes)

11:35.166 --> 11:37.458
Sorry, babe, it's my mom.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.000
Hey, mom.

11:40.125 --> 11:40.958
- [Mom] Sweetheart, where are you?

11:41.083 --> 11:42.333
We had dinner plans.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.666
- Ugh, um, shit, sorry.

11:45.791 --> 11:46.791
- [Mom] Are you coming still?

11:46.916 --> 11:48.000
You want Bobby to come pick you up?

11:48.125 --> 11:50.291
- No, I actually can't make it tonight,

11:50.416 --> 11:51.958
I'm not in town.

11:52.083 --> 11:52.916
- [Mom] Where are you?

11:53.041 --> 11:54.291
- I'm in Louisiana.

11:54.416 --> 11:55.166
- [Mom] Louisiana?

11:55.291 --> 11:58.208
- At Emory's cabin for the week.

11:58.333 --> 11:59.291
I have to write.

11:59.416 --> 12:01.000
- [Mom] Oh, okay.

12:01.708 --> 12:02.708
How did you get there, did you fly?

12:02.833 --> 12:04.916
- Uh, I drove.

12:07.958 --> 12:11.375
♪ But it's not that easy ♪

12:14.458 --> 12:15.541
- Mom?

12:15.666 --> 12:17.541
- [Mom] Well, your brother's here.

12:17.666 --> 12:19.833
You tell him you're not coming.

12:19.958 --> 12:21.083
- [Bobby] You know I can't make it

12:21.208 --> 12:23.166
through these family dinners without you.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.208
- Hi, Bobby.

12:24.875 --> 12:25.958
Sorry to disappoint.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.625
- [Bobby] Calm down, I forgive you.

12:27.750 --> 12:30.375
Hey, can I ask you a real question?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.791
- Nope, only a fake one.

12:32.916 --> 12:33.750
- [Bobby] Ha, ha, ha.

12:33.916 --> 12:35.166
- Hey, is Ellie there?

12:35.291 --> 12:36.750
- [Bobby] Don't you get
contractual bereavement?

12:36.875 --> 12:38.208
- Yeah, it's up.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.625
- [Bobby] Who decides
how much time that is?

12:40.750 --> 12:41.791
That's bullshit.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.041
El, honey.

12:44.291 --> 12:44.833
- [Ellie] Fifi!

12:44.958 --> 12:46.500
- Hi, babygirl.

12:46.625 --> 12:47.916
- [Ellie] Fifi, are you coming?

12:48.041 --> 12:50.166
- No, I'm sorry.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.083
It'll have to be next time, okay?

12:52.083 --> 12:52.583
- [Ellie] Okay.

12:52.583 --> 12:54.375
- Hey, I heard you
started swimming lessons.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.666
Do you like them?

12:55.833 --> 12:57.208
- [Ellie] Yeah.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.125
But sometimes the other kids are mean.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.541
- Do you want me to kill them?

13:02.666 --> 13:05.083
(Ellie laughs)

13:05.250 --> 13:08.083
No, don't ever kill
anyone, that's not funny.

13:08.208 --> 13:10.583
Fifi has had too much juice.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.375
Don't tell your dad I said that?

13:13.500 --> 13:14.541
(Ellie laughs)

13:14.666 --> 13:16.666
Okay, I gotta go.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.125
- [Ellie] Why?

13:18.250 --> 13:22.500
- But Fifi loves you
so, so much, babygirl.

13:22.666 --> 13:23.583
- [Ellie] Love you.

13:23.708 --> 13:25.333
- Okay, can you put Gam back on?

13:25.500 --> 13:26.625
- [Ellie] Okay.

13:26.750 --> 13:27.833
Gam!

13:28.583 --> 13:29.333
- [Mom] Hey, hun.

13:29.458 --> 13:30.416
- Hey, Mom.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.250
I gotta...

13:34.833 --> 13:36.125
- [Mom] Faye?

13:37.125 --> 13:39.958
(eerie music)

13:41.375 --> 13:42.666
Faye, you okay?

13:42.791 --> 13:46.291
- Yeah, hey, tell dad I love
you guys, but I gotta go.

13:46.416 --> 13:47.541
- [Mom] Okay.

13:48.875 --> 13:49.416
What?

13:49.500 --> 13:54.791
The way Jacob and I met was
straight out of a rom-com movie.

13:54.916 --> 13:56.333
It was...

13:56.500 --> 14:01.333
We were the only two people
in this movie theater

14:01.500 --> 14:05.958
for a matinee showing of Casablanca,

14:08.375 --> 14:10.833
which if you've ever seen
that movie, you know,

14:10.958 --> 14:13.000
doesn't really garner laughter.

14:13.125 --> 14:16.708
But I was, and still am to a degree,

14:16.833 --> 14:20.416
so uncomfortable with,
like, super romantic things

14:20.416 --> 14:25.125
that I would just laugh, I
would uncontrollably laugh

14:26.291 --> 14:28.875
throughout the entire movie.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.083
Anyways, at the end of the movie

14:30.208 --> 14:31.583
when the credits were rolling,

14:31.708 --> 14:34.041
I just heard him yell from
the back of the theater,

14:34.208 --> 14:37.083
"Well, that was the dumbest
piece of shit I've ever seen!"

14:38.291 --> 14:44.416
And yeah, we walked out together,
and the rest was history.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.583
How rude.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.041
I bet it was you.

14:55.166 --> 15:00.250
You seemed sketch since
the moment I saw you.

15:00.791 --> 15:01.666
Babe!

15:04.208 --> 15:05.666
Let's dance.

15:06.791 --> 15:07.666
Hm?

15:08.833 --> 15:09.541
Whoa.

15:09.666 --> 15:10.916
(Faye chuckles)

15:11.041 --> 15:12.166
Come on.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.166
Come on!

15:15.541 --> 15:16.375
Get up.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.625
Fifi's had...

15:19.250 --> 15:22.791
A lot of juice, you're
gonna have to hold me up.

15:22.916 --> 15:24.041
Come on, come on.

15:25.875 --> 15:28.250
Oh!

15:28.375 --> 15:29.291
Mm.

15:31.791 --> 15:34.541
(calming music)

15:44.875 --> 15:45.708
Okay.

15:48.083 --> 15:51.041
(Faye chuckles)

15:56.750 --> 15:57.666
Babe?

16:07.250 --> 16:09.333
Babe, let's go to bed.

16:10.750 --> 16:11.666
Come on.

16:15.625 --> 16:16.916
(Faye laughs)

16:17.041 --> 16:18.166
Babe!

16:19.041 --> 16:22.041
(Faye chuckles)

16:31.125 --> 16:31.916
Babe.

16:32.041 --> 16:34.666
(Faye laughs)

16:38.458 --> 16:39.375
Stop!

16:41.041 --> 16:44.000
(Faye chuckles)

16:51.041 --> 16:54.041
(ominous music)

17:51.125 --> 17:51.833
(Slap)

17:52.000 --> 17:54.666
(jarring music)

17:56.041 --> 17:59.541
(Faye breathes heavily)

18:09.250 --> 18:10.375
Okay.

18:16.833 --> 18:17.750
Okay.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.375
(Faye laughs)

18:31.041 --> 18:32.708
Okay, you did that.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.416
(Faye breathes heavily)

18:41.541 --> 18:42.416
No.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.625
Fuck.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.041
(eerie music)

18:47.166 --> 18:48.583
Oh my God.

18:48.708 --> 18:51.333
(tense music)

19:23.041 --> 19:23.958
Ah.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.291
Oh my God.

19:34.041 --> 19:34.958
Ah.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.750
(Faye groans)

19:55.125 --> 19:57.708
(Faye sighs)

19:58.333 --> 20:01.500
(mysterious music)

20:03.750 --> 20:04.666
Why?

20:06.333 --> 20:07.416
Why?

20:12.833 --> 20:13.708
Ah.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.041
What the fuck?

20:18.208 --> 20:19.541
Oh my God.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.916
What the fuck is that?

20:29.958 --> 20:30.833
What?

20:35.125 --> 20:36.250
Ugh.

20:41.916 --> 20:42.916
Wow, Faye.

20:45.041 --> 20:46.791
You're an alcoholic.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.000
Hey!

20:49.125 --> 20:50.291
- [Emory] Yesterday was great.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.916
I wanted to tell you that I thik

20:52.083 --> 20:54.416
you should post a few more
videos today for your followers.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.750
Just remember to let them in on--

20:57.750 --> 20:58.625
- Emory?

21:05.291 --> 21:08.500
I hope there's another one of these.

21:10.125 --> 21:11.541
You know what's funny?

21:11.666 --> 21:14.000
I've always been advised
by people in the industry

21:14.125 --> 21:16.541
to be authentic.

21:17.375 --> 21:18.916
You know, to share my truth.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.500
Because they think that audiences somehow

21:21.625 --> 21:23.583
can detect when somebody's being honest,

21:23.708 --> 21:24.833
and if they're being honest,

21:24.958 --> 21:27.166
then they'll be more attracted.

21:27.291 --> 21:31.083
You know, I'll sell more
books, I'll be more popular.

21:35.458 --> 21:36.541
Bullshit.

21:40.291 --> 21:41.625
Why so sad?

21:45.125 --> 21:47.500
I'll give you some water
after I go tell my fans

21:47.666 --> 21:49.416
about my process.

21:50.333 --> 21:51.416
What?

21:52.916 --> 21:55.208
People hear what they want to hear.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.500
Hey, everyone.

21:57.541 --> 22:00.541
It is absolutely beautiful out here,

22:00.666 --> 22:03.416
I wish you guys could
all see it in person.

22:04.458 --> 22:05.500
But I just wanted to pop back in

22:05.625 --> 22:08.708
and say that the book is going great.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.375
I cannot wait for the day

22:11.500 --> 22:14.041
that I get to share it with you.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.750
Leave me a comment below,

22:15.875 --> 22:18.500
and let me know what you're
excited about this week,

22:18.666 --> 22:22.125
and I'm gonna go start a new chapter.

22:27.500 --> 22:31.041
I'm gonna go start a new chapter.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.916
(calming music)

22:47.625 --> 22:48.750
Hey, babe?

22:52.250 --> 22:55.416
(insects chirping)

23:06.250 --> 23:10.958
Um, hey, I'm gonna go
take a walk really quick

23:11.083 --> 23:12.583
if that's okay?

23:12.750 --> 23:14.916
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

23:15.791 --> 23:18.916
Babe, I promise, I'm fine.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.625
Go start dinner, I'll
be there in a second.

23:42.583 --> 23:46.083
(Faye breathes heavily)

23:52.333 --> 23:54.625
You're fine, you're fine.

24:01.291 --> 24:02.625
Okay.

24:02.750 --> 24:04.583
(eerie music)

24:04.708 --> 24:08.208
(Faye breathes heavily)

24:23.666 --> 24:24.791
Okay.

24:30.458 --> 24:32.083
Faye, you're okay.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.125
You're okay.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.583
Okay.

24:42.666 --> 24:43.750
Okay.

24:48.416 --> 24:49.500
Okay.

24:53.541 --> 24:56.041
When I was in 4th grade, Rachel Schaefer

24:56.166 --> 24:58.916
invited me to one of her slumber parties.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.666
I didn't have very many
friends when I was younger,

25:02.791 --> 25:04.666
so I was super excited about it.

25:05.333 --> 25:09.208
Anyways, when Rachel's parents
went up to go to sleep,

25:09.333 --> 25:12.708
Rachel snuck upstairs and
grabbed the movie Halloween.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.875
I remember trying my hardest

25:16.750 --> 25:18.375
to act like I wasn't scared.

25:19.583 --> 25:23.708
I thought maybe that would
make them all like me.

25:25.916 --> 25:29.875
I woke up the next morning
covered in my own piss.

25:33.166 --> 25:35.458
I found out years later
that they had dipped my hand

25:35.583 --> 25:37.625
in warm water while I was sleeping.

25:40.666 --> 25:42.750
Yeah, I fucking hate Rachel Shaefer.

25:43.416 --> 25:44.791
Should we have kids?

25:46.333 --> 25:48.875
I know I said I didn't
want them, but maybe.

25:49.958 --> 25:51.833
Are you sure you're not hungry?

25:54.750 --> 25:56.125
I know, I know.

25:58.958 --> 26:01.916
All work and no play makes Faye...

26:04.041 --> 26:05.791
so tired.

26:18.541 --> 26:21.666
You don't want to be here, do you?

26:23.708 --> 26:25.083
It's okay, I can tell.

26:31.625 --> 26:33.666
Should I just call Emory?

26:36.791 --> 26:38.666
I should just call.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.250
I should just call and say I'm done.

26:45.916 --> 26:49.375
Let's just take the year off and travel.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.708
I mean, we missed our honeymoon

26:50.875 --> 26:52.708
because I was doing this shit.

26:52.833 --> 26:56.333
Let's go live out your
Bizarre Foods fantasy.

26:57.291 --> 26:58.291
What do you say?

26:59.875 --> 27:01.708
I don't want this.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.750
I want you.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.291
Do you think I'm a good writer?

27:18.583 --> 27:20.166
Be honest, do you really?

27:21.208 --> 27:24.000
(ominous music)

27:25.875 --> 27:26.666
What was that?

27:26.791 --> 27:30.208
(lights buzzing)

27:30.333 --> 27:31.875
What was that?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.375
What was that?

27:37.875 --> 27:38.750
Did you hear that?

27:38.916 --> 27:40.583
Did you hear that?

27:40.750 --> 27:42.125
Say something!

27:43.916 --> 27:45.666
Sorry, I'm sorry.

27:46.791 --> 27:49.291
(Faye sobs)

27:52.333 --> 27:55.750
Okay, I'm just gonna see what it is.

27:56.416 --> 27:57.958
Okay, okay.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.750
(Faye sobs)

28:07.916 --> 28:10.916
(ominous music)

28:23.416 --> 28:27.500
What is in this- who the
hell is in this house?

28:27.666 --> 28:30.458
Get out, please, leave me alone.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.166
Am I going crazy?

28:34.583 --> 28:37.375
(ominous music)

29:19.875 --> 29:22.791
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

29:22.958 --> 29:25.916
(ominous music)

29:34.416 --> 29:35.375
Hey, Jacob.

29:36.791 --> 29:39.541
(ominous music)

30:05.125 --> 30:08.083
(Faye groaning)

30:11.041 --> 30:12.125
- [Jacob] If you do this...

30:15.375 --> 30:18.916
- [Faye] You know this
night is important to me...

30:26.750 --> 30:30.291
(heart faintly beating)

30:46.458 --> 30:49.958
- Get in the closet, we'll just wait.

30:50.791 --> 30:53.541
(ominous music)

31:22.375 --> 31:25.125
The movie Halloween was
super terrifying though.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.208
For years I couldn't walk home from school

31:27.333 --> 31:29.208
without looking over my shoulder

31:29.333 --> 31:30.791
thinking that there was gonna be a man

31:30.916 --> 31:32.666
in a white mask following me.

31:35.208 --> 31:36.291
I don't know.

31:37.708 --> 31:39.125
He was so calm.

31:40.291 --> 31:41.875
You know, and he walked so slow,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.333
I think that's what made it so terrifying,

31:45.500 --> 31:47.500
he was gonna get what he wanted.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.333
And I always thought it was so annoying

31:49.458 --> 31:52.541
how everybody loved Jamie
Lee Curtis's character

31:52.708 --> 31:54.333
because she survived.

31:54.458 --> 31:58.083
You know, she like hides in
the closet and still survives.

32:00.291 --> 32:02.250
I just wanted to scream
at people and be like,

32:02.416 --> 32:04.458
"Surviving isn't fun!"

32:06.791 --> 32:12.041
Like honestly, I'd rather be
the one that gets murdered.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.625
(lights buzzing)

32:14.750 --> 32:17.416
(Faye screams)

32:17.541 --> 32:20.333
(ominous music)

32:29.541 --> 32:30.416
Holy shit.

32:36.708 --> 32:39.541
(birds chirping)

33:31.958 --> 33:33.041
Ah.

34:11.208 --> 34:14.416
(mysterious music)

34:26.125 --> 34:28.791
And this from the Times Book Review.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.833
"Faye Ryan is what we
would get if Brené Brown

34:32.000 --> 34:34.875
and Amy Schumer had a
semi-cynical little sister

34:35.000 --> 34:38.083
who is simply wise beyond her years.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.708
This time, Faye puts the grieving process

34:40.833 --> 34:42.791
into a new perspective.

34:42.916 --> 34:44.791
Both personal and heartbreaking,

34:44.916 --> 34:48.625
Faye peppers the prose with
her signature dark humor,

34:48.750 --> 34:51.666
albeit a little darker
than usual this go around.

34:53.041 --> 34:56.500
We could all learn a lesson
in the dangers of loneliness,

34:57.708 --> 34:59.791
as Faye writes like she's texting

34:59.958 --> 35:01.416
her best friend late at night

35:01.541 --> 35:05.750
in what is her most vulnerable
and raw work to date."

35:12.666 --> 35:15.541
I actually kinda like that one.

35:17.208 --> 35:19.208
- [Emory] Faye, guess what?

35:19.375 --> 35:21.791
You're back up on the
Times Best Seller list.

35:22.833 --> 35:23.583
- Really?

35:23.708 --> 35:24.708
- [Emory] Yes!

35:24.833 --> 35:26.125
- Why?

35:26.250 --> 35:27.416
- [Emory] Because you're
engaging your audience, Faye.

35:27.541 --> 35:29.083
They know you're writing again.

35:29.208 --> 35:31.625
Everybody wants to get a head
start before the next one.

35:31.750 --> 35:32.958
Keep it up!

35:33.083 --> 35:35.041
So, how far along are we?

35:35.166 --> 35:39.791
- Um, it looks like two chapters.

35:39.916 --> 35:41.000
- [Emory] Excellent.

35:41.125 --> 35:42.041
Was the fridge stocked? Are you eating?

35:42.166 --> 35:44.333
Is everything good up there?

35:44.458 --> 35:46.875
- Uh, yes, yeah.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.541
Thank you again for that.

35:48.666 --> 35:51.125
- [Emory] Okay, I'll check in tomorrow.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.041
- Hey, Em.

35:52.208 --> 35:53.083
- [Emory] Yup?

35:53.208 --> 35:54.291
- Um...

35:57.583 --> 36:02.791
Have you ever experienced
anything, like, paranormal here?

36:04.541 --> 36:06.958
- [Emory] Oh, yeah,
there's a ghost for sure.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.458
His name's Randy.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.083
He's totally friendly.

36:10.208 --> 36:10.958
- Really?

36:11.083 --> 36:11.833
- [Emory] What?

36:11.958 --> 36:12.833
No!

36:13.000 --> 36:13.916
It's just quiet out there.

36:14.041 --> 36:15.875
You can hear the wind at night.

36:16.000 --> 36:16.833
(Emory laughs)

36:16.958 --> 36:17.958
Hey, take it easy, Faye.

36:18.083 --> 36:18.833
Okay, babe?

36:18.958 --> 36:20.000
- Okay, bye, Em.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.208
- [Emory] Bye.

36:24.041 --> 36:27.250
(mysterious music)

36:41.333 --> 36:43.916
(lock turns)

37:00.958 --> 37:01.875
- Okay.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.291
Okay!

37:05.375 --> 37:07.750
(Faye chuckles)

37:07.875 --> 37:08.833
You got me!

37:10.958 --> 37:11.916
You got me.

37:15.291 --> 37:16.416
Come out!

37:18.125 --> 37:19.833
Come on out!

37:21.666 --> 37:24.708
Come out, come out, wherever yo!

37:26.041 --> 37:28.791
(Faye chuckles)

37:30.708 --> 37:31.625
Okay.

37:33.208 --> 37:35.833
Well, if you're not gonna let me out,

37:35.958 --> 37:39.791
then why don't you join
me for breakfast, huh?

37:41.833 --> 37:42.916
Yeah, come on.

37:43.833 --> 37:46.708
You think this is funny, right?

37:47.958 --> 37:50.166
I could use a laugh.

37:50.291 --> 37:51.333
(Faye laughs)

37:51.458 --> 37:56.000
So, why don't you tell me a joke?

37:58.166 --> 37:59.041
Yeah.

38:00.250 --> 38:01.375
Come on.

38:07.166 --> 38:08.083
I'm waiting!

38:14.708 --> 38:15.625
No.

38:16.625 --> 38:19.791
You know what would be
better than breakfast?

38:22.375 --> 38:24.250
You're gonna like this.

38:24.375 --> 38:25.541
(Faye chuckles)

38:25.666 --> 38:27.333
You want a drink?

38:28.208 --> 38:29.500
Hm?

38:29.625 --> 38:30.708
'Cause I do.

38:33.291 --> 38:34.208
Yeah.

38:35.208 --> 38:38.625
Let's have a drink, why don't
you come join me at the table?

38:39.500 --> 38:41.416
Let's drink like a family.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.125
I'm still waiting on my joke.

38:52.041 --> 38:52.958
Okay.

38:54.791 --> 38:55.666
Okay.

38:57.166 --> 38:58.083
I'll start.

39:00.125 --> 39:01.333
I'll start.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.000
You ready for this one?

39:04.375 --> 39:06.083
This is hilarious.

39:06.208 --> 39:09.208
(Faye chuckles)

39:09.375 --> 39:13.916
My husband was a saint.

39:15.958 --> 39:22.250
And he fuckin' died in a
car crash because of me!

39:24.041 --> 39:25.125
Yeah, I know!

39:26.708 --> 39:29.291
Because I just had to go to another event

39:29.416 --> 39:33.166
to win some dumb award for
another book that I wrote,

39:33.291 --> 39:37.250
a book that I pulled
right on out of my ass.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.791
(Faye laughs)

39:39.916 --> 39:40.833
Mm.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.458
He didn't even want to go.

39:47.583 --> 39:48.458
Huh-uh.

39:49.375 --> 39:54.041
He probably didn't want to go
to any of them, but he did.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.416
For me.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.625
For me.

40:01.083 --> 40:02.583
(Faye laughs)

40:02.708 --> 40:05.833
Now here I am, alive.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.333
So alive!

40:11.500 --> 40:13.916
(Faye laughs)

40:14.041 --> 40:16.541
Isn't that funny?

40:16.666 --> 40:18.541
So, what do you do around here?

40:19.291 --> 40:20.750
Just like, hang out?

40:22.125 --> 40:23.791
Knock shit over?

40:26.750 --> 40:31.375
You just go around slapping other people’s

40:31.500 --> 40:34.083
upper pussy area, you fuckin' dick?

40:34.208 --> 40:36.791
That was my me time.

40:36.916 --> 40:38.875
Oh, wow.

40:41.208 --> 40:42.125
Oh.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
What's behind door number two?

40:48.041 --> 40:48.958
Mm.

40:50.875 --> 40:52.166
Oh.

40:52.291 --> 40:54.916
(ominous music)

40:55.041 --> 40:57.666
(Faye laughs)

41:00.166 --> 41:01.208
That's good.

41:02.666 --> 41:04.291
Okay!

41:04.458 --> 41:06.250
(Faye chuckles)

41:06.375 --> 41:07.833
I get it.

41:09.625 --> 41:12.541
That's good, that's so funny!

41:12.666 --> 41:15.250
You are so, okay.

41:17.041 --> 41:24.875
A disturbed, young, self-help
author slash recent widow

41:24.875 --> 41:29.083
finds a Ouija board and
dies in a cabin in the woods

41:29.250 --> 41:32.916
while she's trying to
contact her dead husband!

41:33.041 --> 41:34.708
(Faye chuckles)

41:34.833 --> 41:38.291
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.750
That's rich.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.291
Listen, Captain Howdy.

41:51.541 --> 41:53.583
I don't write fiction.

41:54.791 --> 41:59.708
I write things that are
loosely based on the truth.

41:59.875 --> 42:01.750
Sometimes I wonder if I'm a narcissist

42:01.875 --> 42:04.333
because I make everything about me,

42:04.458 --> 42:09.541
but then other times I think
I can't be a narcissist

42:09.666 --> 42:12.625
because I am literally the last person

42:12.750 --> 42:14.166
that I want to be around.

42:14.291 --> 42:15.208
Hey.

42:16.125 --> 42:18.125
Hey, do you follow me on social?

42:19.291 --> 42:20.333
How am I doing?

42:21.708 --> 42:24.041
Did I tell you I'm a best seller?

42:25.250 --> 42:26.833
Mhm, whoop-dee!

42:26.958 --> 42:31.375
But we all know that success
doesn't mean anything

42:31.541 --> 42:34.708
unless we have somebody to
share it with, right babe?

42:36.750 --> 42:38.250
I got you, babe.

42:39.458 --> 42:44.708
I got my baby and he is smokin' hot.

42:46.541 --> 42:47.625
Mm.

42:49.500 --> 42:50.666
Oh my God.

42:50.833 --> 42:54.041
Let's take this shit-show live!

42:54.875 --> 42:57.833
(Faye chuckles)

43:00.291 --> 43:01.791
Hey, everybody.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.208
I got a little writer's
retreat tip for you.

43:10.125 --> 43:13.250
For one for your checklist.

43:14.833 --> 43:15.958
Sometimes...

43:24.666 --> 43:25.625
(Faye laughs)

43:25.750 --> 43:28.666
I forgot what I was gonna say.

43:30.666 --> 43:32.208
Oh, yeah.

43:32.375 --> 43:36.375
Sometimes you have to get your
inspiration from the beyond!

43:41.291 --> 43:45.916
Remember when every 12 year
old girl watched The Craft

43:46.083 --> 43:49.375
and then played light as a
feather, stiff as a board?

43:51.708 --> 43:54.625
We were all low-key in a coven.

43:54.791 --> 43:56.916
So fucked up!

44:00.916 --> 44:03.750
I'm at my publisher's cabin,

44:05.916 --> 44:11.125
and it turns out she made
a deal with the devil.

44:11.666 --> 44:14.416
(Faye chuckles)

44:16.500 --> 44:21.916
So, leave a comment below
if you's a witchy hoe.

44:23.458 --> 44:26.125
(catchy music)

44:28.458 --> 44:31.125
(phone buzzes)

44:31.250 --> 44:32.166
Oh.

44:34.166 --> 44:34.833
Emory!

44:35.666 --> 44:37.625
- [Emory] What the fuck are
you doing, are you drunk?

44:37.750 --> 44:40.000
(Faye laughs)

44:40.125 --> 44:43.208
- No, I'm enlightened.

44:43.291 --> 44:45.916
- [Emory] Faye, so help me
God, take down that last post.

44:46.041 --> 44:48.750
Sober up, get yourself together.

44:48.875 --> 44:50.666
If I didn't care for you as much as I do,

44:50.791 --> 44:52.375
I would fire your ass right now.

44:52.500 --> 44:53.250
- Do it.

44:53.416 --> 44:54.125
- [Emory] Faye!

44:54.250 --> 44:55.625
- Do it!

44:55.791 --> 44:57.541
- [Emory] Faye, you're on such
fucking thin ice right now,

44:57.666 --> 44:59.416
I will come down there if you
don't remove the last post,

44:59.541 --> 45:00.958
and we will have to let you
go if you can't stop acting-

45:01.125 --> 45:02.041
- You know, Emory-

45:02.166 --> 45:03.375
- [Emory] Like a five year old.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.833
- I got a deal for you.

45:06.916 --> 45:10.833
How about I don't write this book.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.416
How 'bout dat?

45:13.375 --> 45:15.250
- [Emory] What the fuck are you doing?

45:15.375 --> 45:16.458
- How 'bout dat?

45:16.583 --> 45:18.041
- [Emory] Faye?

45:18.166 --> 45:19.916
I understand that you're
having a rough day, okay?

45:20.083 --> 45:23.416
Okay, I get that you're
re-living everything

45:23.541 --> 45:24.500
to write this book.

45:24.625 --> 45:26.583
- You don't know shit, Emory.

45:26.750 --> 45:27.833
- [Emory] Faye-

45:27.958 --> 45:31.125
- Stop acting like you know what happened.

45:31.291 --> 45:33.708
- [Emory] You're right,
I don't know, but you do.

45:33.833 --> 45:35.125
And it's up to you to help other people

45:35.250 --> 45:36.666
who are going through the same thing.

45:36.833 --> 45:38.208
Let them know they're not alone.

45:38.333 --> 45:39.666
- Mhm.

45:39.833 --> 45:43.375
Except for they are alone.

45:45.625 --> 45:46.875
I'm alone.

45:47.041 --> 45:48.833
- [Emory] You are not alone, Faye.

45:48.958 --> 45:50.833
- "You are not alone."

45:52.333 --> 45:56.625
Remember when Michael Jackson
sang that song to Lisa Marie

45:56.750 --> 46:01.041
and then they got a divorce,
and then she was alone?

46:01.833 --> 46:03.791
(Faye chuckles)

46:03.916 --> 46:06.458
Ah, and he got to keep Bubbles.

46:07.416 --> 46:11.958
Those little boys, that was so fucked up.

46:12.083 --> 46:13.500
- [Emory] Faye.

46:13.625 --> 46:16.833
- Oh my God, I did love
that Free Willy song though.

46:17.666 --> 46:18.375
- [Emory] Faye!

46:18.541 --> 46:20.000
- What?

46:20.125 --> 46:21.541
- [Emory] I don't want to
stop you in your process,

46:21.666 --> 46:23.791
but you cannot pull shit like this.

46:23.916 --> 46:26.916
You'll be on TMZ tomorrow,
and your career will be over.

46:27.083 --> 46:29.416
- Oh no, that would be the worst!

46:30.291 --> 46:32.375
Why don't you just take it down?

46:32.500 --> 46:36.041
Hey, you take it down,
I'll give you my password.

46:36.166 --> 46:39.458
Get a pen, get a paper, get your family,

46:39.583 --> 46:43.291
get your husband, get your
things, write this down.

46:43.416 --> 46:46.833
My password is "imapieceofshit123”.

46:47.916 --> 46:48.916
(Faye laughs)

46:49.041 --> 46:50.666
- [Emory] Okay, that's it.

46:50.791 --> 46:51.500
I'm coming down there.

46:51.666 --> 46:52.458
- No!

46:52.583 --> 46:53.625
No, no, no, no, no, no.

46:54.250 --> 46:59.500
No, don't worry about it,
I'll take it down, I promise.

47:00.833 --> 47:03.958
Just, God, take a joke.

47:04.083 --> 47:06.041
- [Emory] I'm not kidding, sober up.

47:06.166 --> 47:08.833
Take a cold shower, and call me!

47:08.958 --> 47:10.083
- Okay.

47:14.958 --> 47:20.125
Somebody has their panties in a wad.

47:21.333 --> 47:23.000
Oh, okay.

47:24.166 --> 47:26.500
Look at all you little witchy hoes.

47:28.125 --> 47:30.916
I have to delete it, I'm sorry.

47:36.666 --> 47:37.583
Hey.

47:38.625 --> 47:39.916
Hey.

47:42.625 --> 47:44.083
You want to play a game?

47:45.791 --> 47:47.583
Yeah?

47:47.708 --> 47:48.958
Okay.

47:49.083 --> 47:50.666
Okay.

47:50.791 --> 47:52.958
I just have to pee first.

47:54.208 --> 47:56.458
Don't start without me.

47:57.333 --> 47:59.500
I started writing when I was 9.

48:00.958 --> 48:02.333
Yeah.

48:02.458 --> 48:05.125
Every night before bed I
would write in my journal.

48:06.458 --> 48:08.833
Felt like such an adult thing to do.

48:08.958 --> 48:12.000
They're actually kind of cute
to look back and read now.

48:13.416 --> 48:16.500
The problems I had back then were cute.

48:29.708 --> 48:32.708
(mysterious music)

48:41.583 --> 48:43.625
Did you wilt my flowers?

48:46.833 --> 48:47.916
Rude.

49:05.541 --> 49:06.416
Who are you?

49:11.208 --> 49:12.541
Do I know you?

49:13.750 --> 49:16.375
(tense music)

49:57.125 --> 49:58.208
Jacob?

50:01.041 --> 50:02.416
Is this Jacob?

50:06.250 --> 50:07.500
Are you with him?

50:12.208 --> 50:13.875
(ominous music)

50:14.000 --> 50:17.500
(Faye breathes heavily)

50:23.916 --> 50:25.083
(phone rings)

50:25.250 --> 50:26.583
Please answer.

50:27.708 --> 50:28.583
Please answer.

50:31.000 --> 50:31.750
- [Mom] Hey, hun.

50:31.875 --> 50:32.791
- Mom?

50:32.958 --> 50:34.208
- [Mom] Faye, what's wrong?

50:35.458 --> 50:37.000
- Did I make this happen?

50:37.166 --> 50:38.333
- [Mom] What?

50:38.500 --> 50:40.458
Honey, what are you talking abo?

50:41.250 --> 50:43.333
- Was I a bad kid or something?

50:43.500 --> 50:45.833
What did I do, I don't understand!

50:46.541 --> 50:49.791
- [Mom] Okay, calm down, just breathe.

50:49.916 --> 50:50.958
- I can't.

50:51.083 --> 50:52.458
- [Mom] Yes, you can.

50:53.208 --> 50:54.083
Just breathe.

50:54.250 --> 50:55.458
You have to do that, okay?

50:55.583 --> 50:56.708
- Okay, Mom.

50:56.833 --> 50:57.791
- [Mom] You're okay.

50:57.916 --> 50:58.875
- I'm scared.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.083
- [Mom] Okay.

51:00.250 --> 51:02.083
What are you scared of?

51:02.208 --> 51:04.541
- I don't know, I don't know, I-

51:04.666 --> 51:06.750
- [Mom] Okay, all right, it's okay.

51:06.875 --> 51:07.791
Just breathe.

51:08.458 --> 51:10.000
Okay, you're okay.

51:10.125 --> 51:15.166
- Everything is just so messed up.

51:15.333 --> 51:16.333
- [Mom] You're okay.

51:16.500 --> 51:18.875
- It's not supposed to be like this,

51:19.041 --> 51:22.250
I'm not supposed to be like this.

51:22.375 --> 51:23.458
- [Mom] Faye?

51:25.541 --> 51:26.875
What do you mean, baby?

51:27.583 --> 51:30.125
- He's suppose to be here.

51:30.250 --> 51:33.750
- [Mom] Faye, honey, I know it hurts.

51:33.916 --> 51:38.625
- It hurts so fucking bad.

51:39.291 --> 51:41.375
And it's my fault.

51:41.500 --> 51:44.333
- [Mom] Uh-uh, no, it
it is not your fault.

51:44.458 --> 51:49.500
- But if I just would've skipped the event

51:49.833 --> 51:52.875
like he wanted to do,
then he would be here,

51:53.000 --> 51:56.333
he would be here with me right now.

51:56.458 --> 51:58.791
- [Mom] All right, Faye,
I'm gonna come get you.

51:58.916 --> 52:00.041
- No, no.

52:00.166 --> 52:01.208
- [Mom] What's the address, where are you?

52:01.333 --> 52:02.875
- I need to finish.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.833
- [Mom] Tell me how to find
you, you need to come home.

52:07.583 --> 52:11.583
Honey, baby, you cannot
keep blaming yourself.

52:11.708 --> 52:14.583
Only God knows why it happened.

52:14.708 --> 52:15.291
- Mom.

52:15.458 --> 52:16.583
- [Mom] What, baby?

52:19.208 --> 52:19.958
Faye?

52:20.083 --> 52:21.125
- I gotta go.

52:21.250 --> 52:22.708
- [Mom] No, Faye, no.

52:23.958 --> 52:24.791
- I love you.

52:24.916 --> 52:26.625
- [Mom] Faye, do...

52:28.458 --> 52:32.208
(lights buzz)
(Faye shrieks)

52:32.333 --> 52:35.291
(ominous music)

52:43.541 --> 52:45.625
- Is this my punishment?

52:50.625 --> 52:52.750
If you're gonna kill me, just do it!

52:53.583 --> 52:55.791
No need to drag it out.

52:56.500 --> 52:59.333
(tense music)

53:02.708 --> 53:06.875
I already don't want
to be here, just do it!

53:07.916 --> 53:08.791
Come on!

53:09.500 --> 53:12.541
(dramatic music)

53:14.958 --> 53:16.291
What are you?

53:17.416 --> 53:18.750
Say something.

53:21.125 --> 53:23.250
Fucking say something!

53:23.375 --> 53:26.125
(ominous music)
(Faye screams)

53:26.250 --> 53:31.666
No, no, no, please, please,
please, please, please.

53:33.166 --> 53:35.166
Oh God, God.

53:35.291 --> 53:37.958
God, why? Why? Please!

53:38.083 --> 53:40.875
(ominous music)

53:47.416 --> 53:48.833
Please, please!

53:50.958 --> 53:51.833
Stop!

53:55.291 --> 53:56.208
Stop!

53:56.333 --> 53:59.333
(intense music)

54:03.666 --> 54:04.583
Stop!

54:05.916 --> 54:08.625
(Faye shrieks)

54:14.208 --> 54:16.416
Please, please, please stop.

54:16.541 --> 54:18.291
Go away, go away!

54:20.541 --> 54:21.708
Stop, stop.

54:23.250 --> 54:24.416
Stop, stop.

54:27.541 --> 54:29.833
(Faye sobs)

54:29.958 --> 54:31.875
Oh God, God, God, God.

54:33.083 --> 54:36.083
Please, please, please stop.

54:36.208 --> 54:38.750
(Faye yells)

54:39.708 --> 54:40.625
Please!

54:42.708 --> 54:45.208
Go away, go away, go away!

54:45.375 --> 54:48.416
(dramatic music)

54:58.625 --> 55:01.625
When I was younger, I mean like,

55:01.750 --> 55:02.791
when I was really young,

55:02.916 --> 55:06.000
I used to beg my parents to put a lock

55:06.166 --> 55:09.500
on the outside of my bedroom door

55:09.625 --> 55:14.166
because I was terrified
that I would sleepwalk

55:14.291 --> 55:15.833
in the middle of the night,

55:15.958 --> 55:19.166
and because I knew where all
the knives were in the home,

55:19.291 --> 55:21.416
that maybe I would get them

55:21.583 --> 55:24.333
and then I would murder my whole family.

55:26.916 --> 55:29.541
It sounds weird when I say it out loud,

55:29.541 --> 55:33.791
but I was terrified as a
little kid, I was so scared.

55:33.958 --> 55:37.625
I was scared that maybe
subconsciously I was evil,

55:37.750 --> 55:39.375
or there was something wrong with me,

55:39.500 --> 55:43.416
or maybe I had impulses that
I didn't even know that I had,

55:43.541 --> 55:44.833
and if I were sleeping,

55:45.000 --> 55:46.458
I wouldn't be able to
control those impulses,

55:46.583 --> 55:47.708
and I just...

55:48.708 --> 55:51.875
Oh my God, I just remember
being so terrified

55:52.041 --> 55:54.333
that maybe in the middle of
the night I could do that,

55:54.458 --> 55:56.833
and I didn't want to.

55:56.958 --> 55:58.750
Obviously it wasn't something
that I wanted to do,

55:58.916 --> 56:01.583
I was just really scared of myself.

56:11.500 --> 56:13.916
I think I'm still really scared.

56:18.166 --> 56:20.708
(Faye sobs)

56:22.791 --> 56:23.708
Please.

56:34.416 --> 56:37.041
(tense music)

56:44.500 --> 56:47.375
(Faye gasps)

56:47.500 --> 56:50.166
(Faye vomits)

56:57.666 --> 57:00.083
God, if you're listening...

57:05.583 --> 57:07.166
I need a miracle.

57:10.291 --> 57:11.208
I'm sorry.

57:12.791 --> 57:16.458
I'm so sorry, Jake.

57:16.625 --> 57:18.541
I'm so sorry, baby.

57:19.958 --> 57:23.666
Give me one more chance, and I swear,

57:24.375 --> 57:26.625
I swear I won't fuck it up.

57:28.416 --> 57:30.208
I'll do anything, I will.

57:31.458 --> 57:35.208
Can we just start over?

57:39.208 --> 57:40.750
Can we please...

57:45.000 --> 57:46.500
Just start over.

57:49.541 --> 57:52.166
(tense music)

58:17.291 --> 58:18.166
No, no.

58:27.375 --> 58:28.291
Why?

58:34.500 --> 58:35.583
Ah.

58:48.333 --> 58:50.958
(Faye groans)

58:56.166 --> 59:00.916
You want to know what
absolutely blows my mind?

59:01.041 --> 59:05.625
Like sometimes I spend so
much time thinking about this.

59:05.750 --> 59:09.750
Time doesn't exist.

59:12.208 --> 59:16.583
It doesn't exist, it doesn't
exist in this linear way

59:16.750 --> 59:17.708
that we experience it.

59:17.833 --> 59:21.750
Like, everything is happening now.

59:22.500 --> 59:25.750
Everything, every version of
myself that has ever existed

59:25.875 --> 59:28.125
is happening right now.

59:32.416 --> 59:34.000
But then that makes me really sad,

59:34.125 --> 59:38.916
because then I wonder, well
then, do I always have Jacob?

59:43.875 --> 59:47.041
Or have I never had him?

59:50.125 --> 59:52.083
I don't know if that makes sense.

1:00:07.791 --> 1:00:10.625
(eerie music)

1:00:30.458 --> 1:00:31.375
Okay.

1:00:32.791 --> 1:00:35.625
(eerie music)

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:41.833
That morning...

1:01:46.166 --> 1:01:48.125
He turned off my alarm clock.

1:01:50.708 --> 1:01:56.125
He knew that I couldn't sleep
in, I could never sleep in.

1:01:57.208 --> 1:01:58.958
That wasn't an option for me.

1:01:59.083 --> 1:02:04.083
My day was planned down to the minute,

1:02:04.250 --> 1:02:07.083
but he turned off my alarm
and he let me sleep in

1:02:07.208 --> 1:02:09.250
because he knew that I needed it.

1:02:15.125 --> 1:02:17.375
And I was so mad at him.

1:02:19.416 --> 1:02:23.166
I was so mad at him, I was so mad!

1:02:26.708 --> 1:02:27.833
Why?

1:02:29.875 --> 1:02:31.250
I was always so tired.

1:02:34.291 --> 1:02:35.208
Remember?

1:02:37.750 --> 1:02:38.833
You do.

1:02:40.083 --> 1:02:41.625
I mean, if I would've known that

1:02:41.750 --> 1:02:43.958
was his last morning, maybe...

1:02:46.833 --> 1:02:49.125
I don't know, maybe I would've nicer?

1:02:54.666 --> 1:02:56.291
But I'm not nice.

1:03:03.375 --> 1:03:04.291
I'm not nice.

1:03:08.916 --> 1:03:11.500
(Faye sighs)

1:03:14.125 --> 1:03:16.291
I don't have any friends.

1:03:18.958 --> 1:03:20.041
I used to.

1:03:23.458 --> 1:03:27.125
Jacob married me when I had
no money, but I had friends.

1:03:27.250 --> 1:03:29.541
He married me before I was anyone.

1:03:34.125 --> 1:03:36.958
And we would laugh.

1:03:37.875 --> 1:03:42.125
Ugh, we would laugh about everything.

1:03:45.416 --> 1:03:50.583
Like, if he was gonna die,
he should've died laughing.

1:03:54.333 --> 1:03:56.166
But I took that away from him.

1:04:00.291 --> 1:04:03.875
Was this the last thing
he saw before he died?

1:04:10.291 --> 1:04:13.208
At least my outside matched my inside.

1:04:15.041 --> 1:04:17.875
(tense music)

1:04:41.416 --> 1:04:43.333
That's gonna leave a scar.

1:04:44.166 --> 1:04:47.125
(ominous music)

1:04:53.625 --> 1:04:54.541
(knocking)

1:04:54.666 --> 1:04:55.583
- [Mom] Faye?

1:04:55.708 --> 1:04:57.416
- Mom, please, no, please.

1:04:58.250 --> 1:05:01.125
Don't come in, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1:05:01.833 --> 1:05:03.125
Mom.

1:05:07.916 --> 1:05:08.750
- [Mom] Faye, it's okay.

1:05:08.875 --> 1:05:11.708
- Mom, please just go.

1:05:11.833 --> 1:05:12.666
I'm fine.

1:05:12.791 --> 1:05:13.625
- [Mom] Unlock the door.

1:05:17.916 --> 1:05:20.541
(Faye groans)

1:05:24.375 --> 1:05:28.000
Baby, unlock the door, let me h.

1:05:29.958 --> 1:05:32.625
(Faye groans)

1:05:33.916 --> 1:05:36.666
(ominous music)

1:06:10.291 --> 1:06:12.541
- I was supposed to have a baby.

1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:21.458
We were gonna have a baby.

1:06:23.541 --> 1:06:26.375
I didn't want it...

1:06:28.416 --> 1:06:30.958
until I did.

1:06:32.041 --> 1:06:34.416
But then it was too late.

1:06:34.541 --> 1:06:36.958
(Faye sobs)

1:06:37.083 --> 1:06:38.166
I just...

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.125
Be careful what you wish for, Faye.

1:06:53.250 --> 1:06:56.208
(ominous music)

1:06:58.916 --> 1:07:01.000
- [Emory] Faye, it's Em.

1:07:01.125 --> 1:07:01.958
This isn't funny.

1:07:02.083 --> 1:07:04.083
Where are my chapters?

1:07:05.291 --> 1:07:08.250
(phone buzzes)

1:07:08.375 --> 1:07:09.416
Faye, it's Em.

1:07:09.583 --> 1:07:11.958
Why aren't you answering, where are you?

1:07:11.958 --> 1:07:14.083
Call me back as soon as
you get this message.

1:07:17.041 --> 1:07:18.833
- [Faye] I know what I have to .

1:07:23.125 --> 1:07:24.166
Stop!

1:07:24.291 --> 1:07:25.666
(Faye chuckles)

1:07:25.833 --> 1:07:27.458
- [Jacob] You've just
finished your first book,

1:07:27.583 --> 1:07:28.416
how do you feel?

1:07:28.541 --> 1:07:31.416
- [Faye] Uh, you really want to?

1:07:31.541 --> 1:07:34.208
- [Jacob] I know how I feel,
I've never been more proud.

1:07:34.333 --> 1:07:36.750
- [Faye] Aw, babe,
you're gonna make me cry.

1:07:36.916 --> 1:07:37.958
- [Jacob] What now?

1:07:38.083 --> 1:07:39.083
What's the dream?

1:07:39.250 --> 1:07:41.208
What does Faye L. Ryan want now

1:07:41.333 --> 1:07:44.500
she's about to unleash
her words into the world.

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:45.291
(Faye chuckles)

1:07:45.416 --> 1:07:47.916
- [Faye] You're so dumb.

1:07:48.041 --> 1:07:49.125
Honestly?

1:07:49.250 --> 1:07:50.291
- [Jacob] Tell me.

1:07:50.458 --> 1:07:51.750
- [Faye] I don't know what happens next,

1:07:51.875 --> 1:07:56.666
but what I want is to
just make a difference.

1:07:58.125 --> 1:08:01.625
If this book helps one person,
seriously, just one person,

1:08:01.750 --> 1:08:04.375
then I'll know I've done
something worthwhile.

1:08:04.500 --> 1:08:06.583
- [Jacob] You heard it here
first, ladies and gentlemen.

1:08:06.708 --> 1:08:08.333
- [Faye] Stop!

1:08:08.458 --> 1:08:09.250
- [Jacob] I love you.

1:08:09.375 --> 1:08:10.958
- [Faye] Love you.

1:08:11.083 --> 1:08:12.208
- [Jacob] Hey, babe.

1:08:12.333 --> 1:08:13.750
I know you're having a hard day,

1:08:13.916 --> 1:08:16.625
so I'm picking up Indian
food, and I'm at Martin's now.

1:08:16.750 --> 1:08:19.625
I can't remember which one
it is that you like better.

1:08:19.750 --> 1:08:23.125
Is it the Prisoner or the Pessimist?

1:08:23.250 --> 1:08:25.125
These are terrible names.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:29.208
'Cause a pessimist is never disappointed.

1:08:30.166 --> 1:08:31.833
That's actually good marketing.

1:08:36.791 --> 1:08:37.875
Hey, babe.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:39.500
I know you're having a hard day,

1:08:39.625 --> 1:08:42.083
so I'm picking up Indian
food and I'm at Martin's now.

1:08:42.250 --> 1:08:45.291
I can't remember which one
it is that you like better.

1:08:45.416 --> 1:08:47.625
Is it the Prisoner or the-

1:08:47.750 --> 1:08:53.208
- Hi everyone, this is a public
apology for lying to you.

1:08:58.375 --> 1:09:00.500
I used to mean everything I said,

1:09:01.291 --> 1:09:04.250
but somewhere along the
way I started to say

1:09:05.041 --> 1:09:07.166
what people wanted to hear.

1:09:07.291 --> 1:09:12.416
The version of me you see is...

1:09:14.041 --> 1:09:18.416
Strong, put together, kind,

1:09:18.541 --> 1:09:22.750
compassionate, a teacher, a healer.

1:09:23.458 --> 1:09:24.791
All that.

1:09:24.958 --> 1:09:26.500
And I was that.

1:09:29.083 --> 1:09:30.416
I was.

1:09:30.541 --> 1:09:32.125
When my book started getting popular,

1:09:32.250 --> 1:09:37.375
people would tell me that I
had turned their lives around,

1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:41.416
and I started feeling
responsible for a lot.

1:09:43.708 --> 1:09:45.708
A lot of hearts.

1:09:45.833 --> 1:09:49.041
And I felt like I couldn't make a mistake.

1:09:49.166 --> 1:09:50.791
And there were so many people

1:09:51.416 --> 1:09:54.375
telling me what to do all the time

1:09:55.375 --> 1:10:00.583
that I forgot the sound of my own voice.

1:10:00.750 --> 1:10:01.625
I was miserable.

1:10:05.958 --> 1:10:10.208
And I took my misery out on
the people closest to me.

1:10:10.333 --> 1:10:14.458
I pushed all of my real friends.

1:10:16.541 --> 1:10:18.708
I pushed my husband away.

1:10:21.125 --> 1:10:22.833
I was fighting with him

1:10:26.291 --> 1:10:29.000
when I ran a red light

1:10:30.375 --> 1:10:34.083
that caused the accident that killed him.

1:10:45.833 --> 1:10:47.333
The truth is...

1:10:52.041 --> 1:10:53.375
I'm a failure.

1:10:56.750 --> 1:10:58.083
I'm supposed to be writing a book

1:10:58.250 --> 1:11:00.583
about healing right now and...

1:11:04.458 --> 1:11:09.875
I've come to realize that you
can only heal if you want to.

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:19.500
I don't want to, because
I don't deserve it.

1:11:25.166 --> 1:11:26.833
I'm sorry I let you down.

1:11:51.541 --> 1:11:52.666
Oh, Char.

1:11:55.541 --> 1:11:58.500
(ominous music)

1:12:22.750 --> 1:12:27.708
Are you ever aware of when
you're taking something too far?

1:12:27.875 --> 1:12:29.708
You know, like with anything.

1:12:29.833 --> 1:12:31.708
It could be you're having
an argument with somebody

1:12:31.833 --> 1:12:35.208
and you know that if you
just say that one thing,

1:12:35.333 --> 1:12:37.083
that one thing...

1:12:38.875 --> 1:12:41.458
That you could lose them forever.

1:12:42.583 --> 1:12:45.541
(ominous music)

1:13:38.958 --> 1:13:44.208
Or if you just have one more
pill, just one more pill

1:13:44.583 --> 1:13:47.000
or one more drink, you might not wake up.

1:13:48.708 --> 1:13:51.541
(tense music)

1:14:06.333 --> 1:14:09.625
I would never write this in
a book because quite frankly,

1:14:09.750 --> 1:14:12.208
I wouldn't have a career if I did.

1:14:14.791 --> 1:14:17.250
But I fucking live for those moments.

1:14:18.166 --> 1:14:20.791
(tense music)

1:15:53.708 --> 1:15:56.583
(eerie music)

1:16:15.375 --> 1:16:18.000
(Faye coughs)

1:16:46.500 --> 1:16:49.041
(Faye gasps)

1:17:09.750 --> 1:17:13.000
This is another excerpt from the book.

1:17:13.125 --> 1:17:16.458
"I have scars all over my body.

1:17:16.625 --> 1:17:20.166
My healed wounds, my reminders.

1:17:20.291 --> 1:17:22.375
I can't help but think
about that scene in Jaws

1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:26.916
where Hooper, Quint, and Brody
sit around comparing scars.

1:17:27.958 --> 1:17:30.708
This was a shark, this was a fight.

1:17:30.833 --> 1:17:32.958
This one, she broke my heart.

1:17:34.041 --> 1:17:35.208
And they laughed.

1:17:36.208 --> 1:17:39.750
They laughed over old wounds together,

1:17:40.458 --> 1:17:43.500
while the monster still lurks
in the depths of the ocean

1:17:43.625 --> 1:17:45.125
right beneath their boat."

1:17:51.250 --> 1:17:53.875
(phone rings)

1:17:54.541 --> 1:17:55.291
- [Mom] Hey.

1:17:55.416 --> 1:17:56.416
- Hey, Mom.

1:17:56.541 --> 1:17:57.500
- [Mom] Are you still in Louisiana?

1:17:57.666 --> 1:17:59.875
- I'm sorry I haven't gotten back.

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.708
I'm actually just about to leave.

1:18:02.875 --> 1:18:03.708
- [Mom] You finished up?

1:18:03.833 --> 1:18:04.541
- Mhm.

1:18:04.708 --> 1:18:05.416
- [Mom] Really?

1:18:05.541 --> 1:18:06.625
That's great.

1:18:06.750 --> 1:18:08.041
Why don't you stop by on your way?

1:18:08.166 --> 1:18:10.291
- Yeah, that's actually...

1:18:12.208 --> 1:18:13.583
That's actually why I'm calling.

1:18:13.708 --> 1:18:18.750
I was wondering if maybe
I could come stay with you

1:18:20.666 --> 1:18:21.958
for a little while.

1:18:22.125 --> 1:18:24.083
- [Mom] I would love that.

1:18:24.208 --> 1:18:26.416
Nothing would make me happier.

1:18:27.875 --> 1:18:28.958
- Yeah.

1:18:29.916 --> 1:18:34.500
It's just, I could really use the company.

1:18:36.250 --> 1:18:38.083
- [Mom] Come home, sweetheart.

1:18:39.208 --> 1:18:40.916
I'll get your room ready.

1:18:41.625 --> 1:18:42.750
- Mhm.

1:18:43.750 --> 1:18:44.625
Thank you.

1:18:44.750 --> 1:18:45.666
- [Mom] Okay.

1:18:45.791 --> 1:18:46.666
I love you.

1:18:46.791 --> 1:18:47.958
- Love you.

1:18:48.750 --> 1:18:49.458
- [Mom] Bye, babe.

1:18:49.583 --> 1:18:50.500
- Bye.

1:18:56.625 --> 1:18:58.041
"Life isn't easy,

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.291
and we're just bobbing
in the ebb and flow.

1:19:01.416 --> 1:19:05.250
The cycle never ends,
but it's all important.

1:19:05.375 --> 1:19:06.500
It all belongs.

1:19:07.333 --> 1:19:12.541
The wins, the losses,
the fear, the laughter,

1:19:13.208 --> 1:19:15.666
the pain, the heartbreak.

1:19:15.791 --> 1:19:19.458
I've spent the last 6 months
talking to my dead husband,

1:19:19.583 --> 1:19:23.833
pretending he was still
alive, like nothing happened.

1:19:25.625 --> 1:19:27.125
But something did happen.

1:19:28.625 --> 1:19:29.958
A tragedy happened.

1:19:35.166 --> 1:19:37.291
The kind of story I've read
too many times to count,

1:19:37.416 --> 1:19:40.083
but not one I could accept as my own.

1:19:40.916 --> 1:19:42.041
I didn't want to heal,

1:19:42.708 --> 1:19:45.291
because healing would mean
that I had to acknowledge

1:19:45.416 --> 1:19:46.375
that I was broken.

1:19:47.166 --> 1:19:48.541
And when something heals,

1:19:48.708 --> 1:19:51.000
it doesn't mean it goes
back to its original state.

1:19:52.041 --> 1:19:53.916
Jacob is never coming back.

1:19:55.750 --> 1:19:57.791
My life will never be the same.

1:19:58.625 --> 1:20:00.916
Grief is terrifying.

1:20:06.333 --> 1:20:09.250
And it's never been
defeated by a one man army.

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:16.500
But, what if it's not
supposed to be a fight?"

1:20:24.583 --> 1:20:25.458
That's it.

1:20:27.625 --> 1:20:28.916
Are we...

1:20:29.041 --> 1:20:30.250
Are we done?

1:20:33.041 --> 1:20:34.541
Okay, thank you.

1:20:43.875 --> 1:20:46.541
(catchy music)
