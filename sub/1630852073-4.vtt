<i>[narrator] Previously
on the 1000-lb Sisters.</i>

00:02.937 --> 00:05.604
<i>Today is my very
first Mother's Day,</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:07.072
so we're going to high tea.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.308
[Amy speaking]

00:10.477 --> 00:12.511
[Tammy] You're so ghetto.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.512
Good God.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.014
[burps]

00:15.016 --> 00:16.281
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.716
How are you doing today, Tammy?

00:17.718 --> 00:18.951
Good.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.085
Tammy finally agreed with me

00:20.087 --> 00:21.553
to get a home health nurse.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.589
[Tisa] So, what are
we gonna have to eat?

00:23.591 --> 00:26.291
[Tisa speaking]

00:26.993 --> 00:29.161
[Tammy speaking]

00:34.134 --> 00:36.935
[Amy speaking]

00:38.972 --> 00:40.839
I've been hearing some
[bleep] girl.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.474
[Tammy speaking]

00:46.279 --> 00:48.047
[Tammy] It's not.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.115
Step on that [bleep]
scale and show me.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.786
He's got to fetish
because Tammy's big.

00:53.788 --> 00:56.288
We do not want
to have to bury you.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.135
[country music playing]

01:17.377 --> 01:18.544
[Amy speaking]

01:20.980 --> 01:22.815
We'll go swimming.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.116
[Gage coos]

01:24.118 --> 01:26.318
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.822
Gage loves the water,
so I'm gonna surprise him

01:29.824 --> 01:32.124
and have a pool day with him.

01:32.126 --> 01:34.193
We're putting a blanket on it,

01:34.195 --> 01:36.795
so you won't get no rocks
on your butt.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.163
How about that?

01:38.165 --> 01:40.232
And also, get Tammy of the house

01:40.234 --> 01:42.968
so she could enjoy seeing Gage

01:42.970 --> 01:44.603
for the first time in the water.

01:48.975 --> 01:50.309
Okay.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.910
<i>[Amy] I haven't really talked</i>

01:51.912 --> 01:54.079
<i>to Tammy about
the new boyfriend.</i>

01:54.081 --> 01:55.581
<i>I have a lot going on.</i>

01:55.583 --> 01:57.116
But I'm gonna be nosy

01:57.118 --> 01:58.984
and see what
the [bleep] going on

01:58.986 --> 02:01.520
with her, and Chris, and Misty.

02:03.223 --> 02:04.756
- [indistinct]
- How...

02:12.765 --> 02:15.834
[Tammy speaking]

02:36.222 --> 02:37.122
[Michael speaking]

02:38.558 --> 02:40.058
[Tammy giggles]

02:42.462 --> 02:45.030
[Amy] Smash it up Bobby.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.565
[Amy speaking]

02:53.840 --> 02:56.742
He'll look at me and go,
"Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom."

02:56.744 --> 02:57.743
Look at his hair.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.878
[Tammy speaking]

03:04.617 --> 03:06.652
- [Amy] Got those... Oh, okay.
- [Tammy] Maybe you... [laughs]

03:06.654 --> 03:08.754
Just let him be,
just let him be.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.167
[Amy speaking]

03:23.102 --> 03:24.403
[Tammy] Gage.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.406
Gage.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.409
Hi. [laughs]

03:31.978 --> 03:33.645
[laughter]

03:33.647 --> 03:35.314
[Tammy] What's going on?

03:38.184 --> 03:39.685
[Amy speaking]

03:40.486 --> 03:41.453
[Tammy] Yeah.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.626
What's new?
What it was this about?

03:47.628 --> 03:49.294
About Phillip.

03:58.605 --> 04:01.373
[Tammy speaking]

04:01.375 --> 04:03.175
Like, he's got a fetish
for big women,

04:03.177 --> 04:05.377
and this and that.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.212
What do you like about the guy?

04:18.324 --> 04:21.493
He didn't jump off
talking about sex

04:21.495 --> 04:25.697
or anything...
anything like that.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.866
He told me he wanted
to better my life.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.201
He told me...

04:32.205 --> 04:34.840
just he wanted to build a life.

04:34.842 --> 04:38.977
Build a foundation
before we got serious.

04:52.358 --> 04:55.894
<i>[Amy] Tammy should be
100% focused on herself.</i>

04:55.896 --> 04:59.064
Worry about the relationship
when you're healthy.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.899
<i>You can't be in a relationship</i>

05:00.901 --> 05:03.101
<i>if you're six feet under.</i>

05:06.472 --> 05:07.539
[Gage cries]

05:07.541 --> 05:08.674
Right now,

05:08.676 --> 05:10.275
I got a lot on my mind,

05:10.277 --> 05:12.511
a lot on my plate,

05:12.513 --> 05:14.112
I can't handle your drama.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.881
So, at the end of day,

05:15.883 --> 05:17.649
you're gonna have
to make your own choices.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.921
[Amy speaking]

05:28.328 --> 05:31.163
- I can't be a mom to you.
- [Tammy speaking]

05:34.200 --> 05:36.935
Besides you have
no freaking opinion

05:36.937 --> 05:38.937
in what I do in my life.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.711
[Amy speaking]

05:59.992 --> 06:01.159
Okay.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.997
[Amy speaking]

06:25.017 --> 06:26.818
Stay the [bleep] out
of my business.

06:35.461 --> 06:39.331
[country music playing]

06:41.968 --> 06:45.971
[Chris]
We got hamburger, chicken.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.506
<i>You know, in a couple days,
me and Tammy</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.441
<i>have to check-in
with the doctor,</i>

06:49.443 --> 06:51.243
<i>and I'm really worried
about that</i>

06:51.245 --> 06:54.146
because the last time
I had seen Dr. Smith is when

06:54.148 --> 06:56.982
<i>I got down to 380,
got approved for surgery.</i>

06:56.984 --> 06:59.251
[Dr. Smith]
Three seventy-nine and a half.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.552
Great job, man.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.887
- Woo.
- Nice job.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.556
The next week, I had leg surgery

07:04.558 --> 07:07.092
to remove a boil from my leg.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.060
<i>Six weeks of sitting
on the couch,</i>

07:09.062 --> 07:12.364
ended up gaining 40lbs back.

07:12.366 --> 07:15.400
When we buy food with the big
packages like this we buy,

07:15.402 --> 07:17.803
we're gonna have to cut them
into smaller packages.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.704
Now, I measure out my food

07:19.706 --> 07:21.840
to where it's, like,
a cup of vegetables.

07:21.842 --> 07:25.043
A cup is all I'm gonna be
eating all together.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.412
[Chris speaking]

07:29.715 --> 07:31.817
<i>And this is Tammy's
first appointment</i>

07:31.819 --> 07:33.218
<i>since she's left rehab,</i>

07:33.220 --> 07:35.587
so I hope she stayed on track.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.489
[Brittany] So,
what do you think is going on

07:37.491 --> 07:39.357
with Tammy
since she's been back?

07:39.359 --> 07:40.759
[Chris]
When she first come home,

07:40.761 --> 07:43.562
she was all about
staying to herself

07:43.564 --> 07:45.964
and staying motivated
to lose weight.

07:45.966 --> 07:50.302
But now, that she's had
time to settle in,

07:50.304 --> 07:52.838
she's more worried about
being with this guy

07:52.840 --> 07:54.806
than staying on her diet.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.143
<i>I'd have a talk with Tammy
about her new boy.</i>

07:58.145 --> 08:00.745
<i>And now, I recently
found out online</i>

08:00.747 --> 08:02.547
that he throws parties

08:02.549 --> 08:05.717
for big women, you know,

08:05.719 --> 08:11.189
so I feel that he has
personal agenda

08:11.191 --> 08:13.592
to make money off her following.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.261
Approaching Tammy about
anything is kinda difficult.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.629
[Brittany] Mmm-hmm.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.598
You know, we made
a comment about

08:19.600 --> 08:21.299
why would you date somebody

08:21.301 --> 08:23.702
that said if you got
below 300lbs,

08:23.704 --> 08:25.070
that they were leaving?

08:33.980 --> 08:34.913
Hmm.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.582
So, that pretty much tells me

08:37.584 --> 08:40.085
that she ain't been
doing nothing but eating.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.821
<i>The worst part about Tammy is</i>

08:42.823 --> 08:46.157
she wears her heart
on her sleeve.

08:46.159 --> 08:49.895
Anybody that seems to give her
a little bit of attention,

08:49.897 --> 08:51.963
she falls head over heels for

08:51.965 --> 08:55.000
<i>and you try to step in
between her and that person,</i>

08:56.168 --> 08:58.603
hell has no fury
as a woman in love.

09:00.473 --> 09:04.009
I truly believe that

09:04.011 --> 09:07.879
Amy starting to have
what Tammy wants in life

09:07.881 --> 09:10.148
and she's somewhat jealous.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.218
So, she's either gonna choose

09:13.220 --> 09:16.054
get healthy and live longer,

09:16.056 --> 09:19.224
or stay fat and be happy
in a relationship.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.293
But the doctor only said
she only have

09:21.295 --> 09:24.162
four, five years to live
if she stay big.

09:26.232 --> 09:30.669
Tammy is looking for love
in all the wrong places.

09:30.671 --> 09:33.171
<i>I just hope this new boyfriend</i>

09:33.173 --> 09:36.207
<i>hasn't caused any problems
with her diet.</i>

09:37.577 --> 09:39.110
Tammy and I have a follow-up

09:39.112 --> 09:41.146
doctor's appointment
with Dr. Smith.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.648
<i>If Tammy starts slipping
on her diet,</i>

09:43.650 --> 09:45.650
<i>she will gain weight
rather quickly</i>

09:45.652 --> 09:47.519
<i>and not even realize it.</i>

09:47.521 --> 09:51.022
So, this is gonna be
the moment of truth for Tammy.

10:04.637 --> 10:05.770
[knocks on door]

10:05.772 --> 10:07.205
[Amy] Come in.

10:09.075 --> 10:10.642
- Hey, girl.
- [Amy] Hey.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.876
How are you doing?

10:13.713 --> 10:16.348
<i>[Tisa] Me and Tammy,
we're working on things,</i>

10:16.350 --> 10:18.049
<i>trying to keep her mobile.</i>

10:18.051 --> 10:22.387
Sometimes her attitude
is a challenging thing.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.624
But there is a need
for her to have help

10:25.626 --> 10:27.726
because of her...
of her weight,

10:27.728 --> 10:30.662
that's why I'm here.
I wanna help her.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.497
[Tammy speaking]

10:32.499 --> 10:34.399
[Tisa] That is cute.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.470
I love it.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.507
Well, hey, what are
we gonna do today?

10:42.509 --> 10:44.843
- What do you want me to do?
- [Tammy] I don't know.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.278
The weather
is good outside today.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.347
Let's think about that walk.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.217
- You're crazy.
- Hey, you promised me.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.121
Today, my goal is to try
to get her out

10:56.123 --> 10:58.923
of that wheelchair
and walk to that mailbox,

10:58.925 --> 11:01.593
<i>because Amy asked me to push her</i>

11:01.595 --> 11:03.228
<i>and I want her to try.</i>

11:03.230 --> 11:05.196
I'm gonna do the bath,
get that done,

11:05.198 --> 11:06.831
and you think about it.

11:08.401 --> 11:11.169
But I think she's at a point
that she's just scared

11:11.171 --> 11:14.072
and maybe a little embarrassed
if she gets tired.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.007
<i>But it's very important for her</i>

11:16.009 --> 11:18.076
to do some kind of mobility.

11:20.279 --> 11:21.579
Where are you shoes?

11:24.483 --> 11:27.452
You ain't gonna walk?

11:27.454 --> 11:30.522
Not even
like just part of the way?

11:30.524 --> 11:33.124
Not all the way?

11:33.126 --> 11:36.161
[Tammy speaking]

11:48.374 --> 11:51.176
Come on, Tammy.
You made a promise to me.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.777
I'm gonna be right with you.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.348
Okay.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.117
What are you scared of?

11:59.119 --> 12:00.885
I'm not scared. [bleep]

12:02.722 --> 12:04.522
Well, why can't you
don't wanna walk?

12:08.761 --> 12:10.428
If you think
that you can't do it,

12:10.430 --> 12:11.963
I'm thinking that you can.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.167
And I know you can.

12:16.169 --> 12:19.404
What are you gonna do
if we go to the swimming pool?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.773
You're gonna have
to get out and walk.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.341
We might as well
prepare ourselves

12:23.343 --> 12:24.976
for that walk now, huh?

12:26.645 --> 12:28.113
F the pool.

12:30.449 --> 12:33.451
[Tammy speaking]

12:40.459 --> 12:41.993
[Tisa] What are you
gonna tell Dr. Smith

12:41.995 --> 12:43.561
if he ask you
what you've been doing?

12:45.364 --> 12:47.232
Don't you wanna
have your surgery?

12:49.135 --> 12:51.236
Hello?

12:51.238 --> 12:54.272
[Tammy speaking]

13:09.255 --> 13:12.257
[Producer speaking]

13:22.401 --> 13:24.836
- So, how are you doing buddy?
- All right.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.671
As soon as I see Chris,
I can tell

13:26.673 --> 13:28.072
that he gained weight.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.841
Go ahead and step up here,
Chris.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.976
Let's see what you weigh today.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.413
I'm expecting him to tell me
that I can't have the surgery.

13:38.784 --> 13:41.019
[Amy speaking]

13:41.021 --> 13:43.521
Oh! It was. It was.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.257
My grandma was a hoarder,
my mom's a hoarder.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.960
[Amy speaking]

13:54.266 --> 13:56.701
[upbeat music playing]

13:59.371 --> 14:01.206
[Amy speaking]

14:01.208 --> 14:02.273
[Tammy speaking]

14:04.343 --> 14:07.312
After that heated discussion
about Philip,

14:07.314 --> 14:11.816
I wanna give Tammy some much
needed sister bonding time,

14:11.818 --> 14:15.019
<i>you know,
get her mind off the drama</i>

14:15.021 --> 14:16.588
and make a YouTube video.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.825
[Tammy speaking]

14:20.827 --> 14:23.361
You know how all these
women online are wearing

14:23.363 --> 14:27.065
fake wigs to parties
and stuff like that?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.667
- [Tammy speaking]
- [Amy] Yeah.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.336
<i>When we first started YouTube,</i>

14:31.338 --> 14:33.504
we were very morbidly obese

14:33.506 --> 14:37.242
eating anything new
to review it.

14:37.244 --> 14:42.046
And the stuff that we were
doing was not healthy at all.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.887
Then, when we started
our weight loss journey,

14:48.889 --> 14:52.657
we started moving on to other
stuff like makeup and stuff,

14:52.659 --> 14:56.728
you know, if our video
touches one person

14:56.730 --> 14:58.863
that's a job well done.

14:58.865 --> 15:01.266
- Hey, y'all, it's Amy.
- And Tammy.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.435
And today, we have a bunch
of wigs to try on

15:04.437 --> 15:08.072
because, you know,
it livens up the party.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.476
You can hide your identity,
you can make a new identity.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.080
Wigs can give you confidence.
Bam!

15:22.154 --> 15:24.155
And today, I did
this makeup, look.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.125
Oh.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.760
That can make you
look attractive.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.729
I am from the planet Mars.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.331
[Tammy]
You look like your mother.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.733
- Whatever, bitch.
- [Tammy laughing]

15:35.735 --> 15:38.636
They can make you sensual.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.406
I'm going to the mall
and going shopping.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.110
- [Producer speaking]
- Sensual.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.612
You look like you have a mullet.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.583
Wigs could do a lot
for your looks.

15:52.585 --> 15:54.819
[Amy speaking]

15:57.890 --> 16:02.026
Go get my nonfat double soy
extra foam chocolate latte.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.931
Sadly this is what
we really look like.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.601
[laughs]

16:10.603 --> 16:12.770
Yeah.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.807
[Amy speaking]

16:27.052 --> 16:29.487
Thank God.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.056
Thank you for watching.
I hope you enjoyed this video.

16:32.058 --> 16:33.291
And we'll talk
to you guys later.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.359
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.260
Bye, YouTube. Subscribe.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.031
Oh. [bleep]

16:50.976 --> 16:54.879
[Producer speaking]

16:54.881 --> 16:56.381
No.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.386
Yeah.

17:09.161 --> 17:12.163
[rock music playing]

17:22.141 --> 17:24.609
[Amy speaking]

17:24.611 --> 17:27.245
[Michael speaking]

17:27.247 --> 17:30.281
[Amy speaking]

17:39.458 --> 17:41.926
<i>So, today we're doing
a tidy up and hopefully,</i>

17:41.928 --> 17:43.394
<i>I can get rid of some
of these... [bleep]</i>

17:43.396 --> 17:44.862
<i>in my house.</i>

17:44.864 --> 17:46.531
The older he gets
the more [bleep] we get.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.565
[Michael] Yeah.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.904
[Amy speaking]

18:21.266 --> 18:24.168
I got to have Tammy more active

18:24.170 --> 18:28.339
before I can even think
about leaving this place,

18:28.341 --> 18:30.308
and I only want
what's best for her.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.512
<i>Now that Tammy has a nurse,
I have time for myself.</i>

18:34.514 --> 18:36.681
<i>Now, I can organize my house</i>

18:36.683 --> 18:39.450
but it's totally got out
from under me.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.085
There's stuff everywhere.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.754
<i>Gage's stuff is not where
they're supposed to go,</i>

18:43.756 --> 18:45.790
and it's just overwhelming,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.158
and I need help.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.194
[Amy speaking]

19:03.175 --> 19:06.010
[Amy speaking]

19:06.012 --> 19:09.046
[Michael speaking]

19:14.586 --> 19:16.487
Yeah.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.890
I can't fold for [bleep].

19:18.892 --> 19:21.626
You're better at...
you're better at it than I am.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.969
<i>Growing up, my mom
worked two to three jobs,</i>

19:31.971 --> 19:33.738
and after my grandma died,

19:33.740 --> 19:35.840
we really didn't know
how to clean

19:35.842 --> 19:38.676
because grandma usually
kept the house clean.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.078
<i>So, I know what it's like
not to want company</i>

19:41.080 --> 19:44.415
to come over because
your house is so filthy.

19:44.417 --> 19:47.051
<i>But that's not
what I want for Gage.</i>

19:47.053 --> 19:49.487
Here's a thing that I found,

19:49.489 --> 19:53.357
professional
certified organizers.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.492
<i>Now I got a kid,</i>

19:54.494 --> 19:56.227
<i>I want the house
to be clean for him.</i>

19:56.229 --> 19:59.263
I wanna do everything in
my power to make Gage happy,

19:59.265 --> 20:01.732
<i>so I need to get
my life in order.</i>

20:01.734 --> 20:04.035
[Amy speaking]

20:07.372 --> 20:09.774
I'm not gonna lie,
I had cheat day yesterday.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.677
- What did you eat?
- Two slices of pizza.

20:12.679 --> 20:15.813
I had a bacon cheeseburger
the other day.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.982
[Tammy speaking]

20:17.984 --> 20:19.884
If Tammy's weight
starts going back up,

20:19.886 --> 20:21.719
<i>it's kinda like
game over for her.</i>

20:23.622 --> 20:25.990
[dramatic music playing]

20:29.628 --> 20:31.262
- [Chris] All right.
- [Brittany] Okay.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.465
- [Tammy] Yes?
- [Brittany] Hello.

20:34.467 --> 20:35.866
[Tammy] Hello.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.835
- Ready to go?
- Yup.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.707
<i>Me and Tammy, we have a
follow up appointments today</i>

20:42.709 --> 20:44.609
<i>with Dr. Smith.</i>

20:44.611 --> 20:47.745
<i>We haven't talked too much
since we got into it.</i>

20:47.747 --> 20:50.181
Tammy is unpredictable,

20:50.183 --> 20:52.883
<i>so I'm not gonna add
anything else</i>

20:52.885 --> 20:54.352
<i>and bring anything up.</i>

20:54.354 --> 20:57.521
She might throw a fit and not
go even to the appointment.

20:57.523 --> 20:59.457
You need ne
to move the chair up?

20:59.459 --> 21:01.459
No.

21:01.461 --> 21:04.495
[Tammy speaking]

21:19.077 --> 21:21.679
- [Chris] You're situated?
- Getting there.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.947
- [Chris] Getting there?
- Yeah.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.815
Well, take your time
and get situated

21:24.817 --> 21:26.651
because it is a three hour ride.

21:28.687 --> 21:30.554
- You ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

21:30.556 --> 21:33.124
[Chris] Cool.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.659
Tammy, what have you been
feeling about going

21:34.661 --> 21:36.894
- to the doctor this time?
- I'm ready.

21:43.702 --> 21:46.671
Is it hard
with the temptations at home

21:46.673 --> 21:49.674
to eat like you're supposed to?

21:49.676 --> 21:54.011
I'm doing fairly well
in my opinion.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.846
[Tammy speaking]

21:55.848 --> 21:57.214
What did you eat?

21:57.216 --> 22:00.051
[Tammy speaking]

22:07.059 --> 22:09.427
Tammy is talking about how
good she's doing on her diet,

22:09.429 --> 22:12.763
but then contradicts herself
about some cheat days.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.999
<i>I figured
she's probably gained weight,</i>

22:15.001 --> 22:17.902
<i>because she usually
don't realize how much</i>

22:17.904 --> 22:20.071
<i>of a cheat day or week she's had</i>

22:20.073 --> 22:21.806
<i>until she step on the scale.</i>

22:27.212 --> 22:28.946
I guess the worst thing
that's possible

22:28.948 --> 22:32.083
is he could tell me
I'm not accepted

22:32.085 --> 22:34.185
for the surgery anymore.

22:34.187 --> 22:35.219
[Tammy] Why do you think that?

22:35.221 --> 22:37.221
[Chris] Well, because
I've gained weight.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.023
<i>You know, to get approved
for the surgery,</i>

22:39.025 --> 22:42.693
and then have, you know,
health issue emergency,

22:42.695 --> 22:44.128
and then you end up gaining

22:44.130 --> 22:46.530
some of your weight back sucks.

22:46.532 --> 22:49.500
<i>If Dr. Smith tells me that
I can't have this surgery,</i>

22:49.502 --> 22:51.402
it would be devastating.

22:51.404 --> 22:54.271
[dramatic music playing]

23:07.152 --> 23:08.753
Going into this appointment,
you know,

23:08.755 --> 23:10.020
I know I've gained weight,

23:10.022 --> 23:11.756
<i>a lot of things
going through your head</i>

23:11.758 --> 23:13.157
<i>about what you should have done</i>

23:13.159 --> 23:14.925
<i>or what you could have did.</i>

23:14.927 --> 23:16.927
But now you got
to walk into the doctor

23:16.929 --> 23:18.396
and step on the scale.

23:20.799 --> 23:22.733
- Hey, Brittany, how are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

23:22.735 --> 23:24.335
Good to see you.

23:24.337 --> 23:27.071
- So, how are you doing, buddy?
- All right.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.939
[Dr. Smith]
<i>I am the bariatric surgeon</i>

23:28.941 --> 23:30.741
<i>for both Chris and Tammy.</i>

23:30.743 --> 23:32.810
I haven't seen Chris
and Tammy in a few months.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.612
I know Tammy has been in rehab.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.448
Chris has had some health
issues as well with his leg,

23:37.450 --> 23:38.983
<i>but as soon as I see Chris,</i>

23:38.985 --> 23:41.452
<i>I can tell
that he gained weight.</i>

23:41.454 --> 23:42.987
So, I'm a little concerned

23:42.989 --> 23:45.589
about what Chris
may weigh in today.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.858
You've had some things
going on with you.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.860
Tell me what happened.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.663
Two weeks, whatever...
The last doctor's appointment,

23:52.665 --> 23:55.699
an abscess popped up on
the inside of my upper thigh.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.234
- [Dr. Smith] Okay.
- Seven days later,

23:57.236 --> 23:59.036
they removed it. But, I mean,

23:59.038 --> 24:01.005
it slowed me down a whole lot.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.174
There was almost eight weeks

24:03.176 --> 24:04.975
and nothing but sitting down.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.511
I couldn't really do nothing
but walk to the bathroom.

24:07.513 --> 24:09.747
Right. You probably put some
weight on during that time.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.149
Oh, guarantee.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.684
- You wanna weigh in?
- Not really.

24:13.686 --> 24:14.985
You wanna see where we're at?

24:14.987 --> 24:16.287
I don't like this machine
but I will.

24:16.289 --> 24:19.156
[Dr. Smith] Okay. All right.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.692
Two weeks ago,
when I weighed in at Tammy's,

24:21.694 --> 24:25.763
I weighed 412-lbs.
But to be honest,

24:25.765 --> 24:28.199
<i>I don't know
what the scale is gonna say.</i>

24:28.201 --> 24:30.167
[Dr. Smith] Go ahead
and step up here, Chris.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.769
Let's see what your weigh today.

24:40.178 --> 24:42.046
All right, 414.

24:43.915 --> 24:45.850
<i>[Chris] I don't understand it.</i>

24:45.852 --> 24:47.651
<i>I don't even know how I gained</i>

24:47.653 --> 24:49.653
because I've been
on a strict diet

24:49.655 --> 24:52.590
and I exercise more.

24:52.592 --> 24:54.158
<i>So, I don't know.</i>

24:54.160 --> 24:55.726
So, obviously,

24:55.728 --> 24:57.294
I'd love to see
where you were before.

24:57.296 --> 24:59.430
We had you write it down.
That was around 380.

25:01.266 --> 25:05.569
I'm expecting him to tell me
that I can't have the surgery.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.805
<i>My greatest fear
is that Dr. Smith</i>

25:07.807 --> 25:09.440
<i>is gonna drop me as a patient.</i>

25:17.749 --> 25:19.350
Yeah. Okay.

25:29.294 --> 25:31.695
[dramatic music playing]

25:35.600 --> 25:37.167
So, obviously,

25:37.169 --> 25:38.869
I'd love to see
where you were before.

25:38.871 --> 25:42.473
We had you write it down.
That was around 380.

25:42.475 --> 25:45.609
You have good explanations
as why this went up,

25:45.611 --> 25:47.111
but that's behind us.

25:48.947 --> 25:50.681
Here's what I'm gonna do
for you.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.286
So, I'm gonna go ahead
and we're gonna plan

25:55.288 --> 25:57.888
on you having surgery here
in a few weeks.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.924
- Okay?
- Yes.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.026
But here's what I need from you.

26:04.129 --> 26:06.897
I need you below 400
for us to do it.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.633
- Okay.
- [Dr. Smith] Okay?

26:09.635 --> 26:12.536
<i>[Chris] I got four weeks
to get under 400-lbs.</i>

26:12.538 --> 26:15.706
<i>So, this is the last ditch
effort to make weight.</i>

26:15.708 --> 26:16.974
But there's always
that little voice

26:16.976 --> 26:18.576
in the back
of your head that's like,

26:18.578 --> 26:20.344
oh, damn, are you gonna make it?

26:21.646 --> 26:23.480
You hit that number
and we're good to go.

26:23.482 --> 26:24.648
- Works for me.
- All right.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.617
- We'll see you soon, okay?
- [Chris] All right, man.

26:26.619 --> 26:29.153
All right.

26:29.155 --> 26:30.721
<i>So, Chris gets on the scale.</i>

26:30.723 --> 26:32.656
<i>He weighs in about 414 pounds.</i>

26:32.658 --> 26:35.426
I gave him a green light
with some stipulations.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.928
Chris has been compliant
for me this entire time.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.263
He's done pretty much everything

26:39.265 --> 26:40.331
I've asked him to do.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.132
<i>And so, I'm hopeful
that we can get Chris</i>

26:42.134 --> 26:44.401
back on track
so we can get him the surgery.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.337
He's been working
for this for a long time.

26:48.673 --> 26:49.807
[Tammy speaking]

26:49.809 --> 26:51.709
[Chris speaking]

26:53.178 --> 26:54.545
[nurse speaking]

26:54.547 --> 26:55.980
Okay.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.585
[Tammy speaking]

27:14.232 --> 27:15.532
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

27:15.534 --> 27:16.834
- How are you?
- [Tammy] Good.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.002
And you got a smile
on your face.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.303
That's what's important.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.705
- So, Tammy.
- [Tammy] Yes.

27:21.707 --> 27:24.208
How was your time in rehab?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.544
Okay.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.013
So, let's talk
about the exercise.

27:29.015 --> 27:32.683
What kind of things were you
doing when you were in rehab?

27:37.856 --> 27:40.891
- Did stairs, bicycle.
- Okay.

27:40.893 --> 27:44.061
My highest steps were,
like, 200.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.196
- Wow, that's good.
- [Tammy] Mmm-hmm.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.800
Are you still working on even
small goals as far as walking?

27:51.803 --> 27:53.303
Not really.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.509
<i>[Dr. Smith] You know, I would
have liked to see Tammy</i>

27:58.511 --> 28:00.944
<i>stay in the rehab facility
much longer.</i>

28:00.946 --> 28:03.213
<i>But ultimately,
it's her decision.</i>

28:03.215 --> 28:04.782
Tammy has to show herself

28:04.784 --> 28:07.117
that she can do this on her own.

28:07.119 --> 28:10.387
All right. Let's see
what you weigh, okay?

28:10.389 --> 28:12.456
Well, step up here on the scale.

28:15.493 --> 28:17.628
<i>[Chris] The first week
Tammy was home from rehab,</i>

28:17.630 --> 28:18.896
<i>she did really well.</i>

28:18.898 --> 28:21.331
<i>She weighed 624 pounds.</i>

28:21.333 --> 28:23.534
But then she started
talking to this dude

28:23.536 --> 28:25.235
that like big women.

28:25.237 --> 28:27.705
So, we don't know
how this is gonna go now.

28:27.707 --> 28:30.107
<i>If Tammy's weight
starts going back up,</i>

28:30.109 --> 28:33.677
<i>it's kinda like game over
for her because all that work</i>

28:33.679 --> 28:35.979
<i>she did in rehab
was for nothing.</i>

28:40.885 --> 28:44.054
[upbeat music playing]

28:47.192 --> 28:50.194
[Amy speaking]

28:54.699 --> 28:56.433
<i>Me and Michel
called the home organizer</i>

28:56.435 --> 28:59.002
<i>and they're coming over today
to help us organize.</i>

29:06.144 --> 29:07.444
<i>But now that I'm a mom,</i>

29:07.446 --> 29:10.914
I want a nice clean
environment for Gage.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.550
I want him to be able
to play anywhere he wants

29:13.552 --> 29:15.853
in the house and be safe.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.087
- [Amy Payne] Hi.
- Hi.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.188
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

29:18.190 --> 29:19.823
- [Amy] Good. How are you?
- [Jamie] Hello.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.526
- I'm Amy.
- I'm Jamie.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.194
[Amy Payne] Thanks so much
for having us today.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.662
- Thank you for coming.
- Have you ever worked

29:25.664 --> 29:27.664
with a professional
organizer before?

29:27.666 --> 29:30.901
Okay. What we want is to
help you get rid of anything

29:30.903 --> 29:32.636
that we would consider clutter.

29:32.638 --> 29:35.472
So, clutter doesn't
necessarily mean it's trash,

29:35.474 --> 29:38.342
it just means it no longer
serves a purpose for you.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.378
[Amy speaking]

29:43.648 --> 29:46.116
[Amy Payne] Um, okay.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.986
Okay. It's hard to say.
We try not to judge.

29:48.988 --> 29:52.189
I guess it's a matter of...
I think it's bad.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.363
[Amy Payne]
Our opinion doesn't matter.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.597
- [Jamie] Yeah.
- [Amy Payne] We're here

30:00.599 --> 30:02.432
to make your house
function for you.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.734
Sound good?

30:03.736 --> 30:05.269
- All right.
- All right. Let's do it.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.503
We're gonna have fun.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.439
I'm just gonna gather up
all the baby stuff over here.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.609
Do you have a laundry basket
we can use to put things in?

30:12.611 --> 30:14.077
- It's full.
- [Amy Payne] Is this is it?

30:14.079 --> 30:15.579
Oh, it's full?
Do you wanna throw

30:15.581 --> 30:16.847
a load of laundry
in while we're here?

30:16.849 --> 30:18.515
Yeah.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.517
<i>It's hard for me
to throw away stuff</i>

30:20.519 --> 30:23.954
because years of generation
taught me that way.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.522
My grandma was a hoarder.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.791
My mom's a hoarder.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.360
<i>I know what it's like
coming from a hoarding house</i>

30:30.362 --> 30:34.198
where you barely had a snake
line to get through the house.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.733
[Amy Payne] Amy, I see
you live in a duplex.

30:36.735 --> 30:38.669
Do you know the person
that lives next door?

30:38.671 --> 30:40.504
[Amy speaking]

30:40.506 --> 30:42.806
Oh, really? [laughs]

30:42.808 --> 30:44.441
[Amy] It's a love hate
relationship.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.743
- Oh, okay.
- I love her and she hates me.

30:46.745 --> 30:48.846
[laughter]

30:48.848 --> 30:50.380
Nice. All right.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.182
So, looks like on the stove,

30:52.184 --> 30:53.884
you've got some pots and pans,

30:53.886 --> 30:56.653
some dirty dishes,
we've got baby bath stuff.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.589
- Oh...
- [Amy] Yeah, we got to get...

30:58.591 --> 31:01.258
I think there's a baby bath
over here in the corner.

31:01.260 --> 31:04.294
We see clutter around
all different surfaces,

31:04.296 --> 31:06.096
like the couch, the floor.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.731
Michael, you wash dishes,

31:07.733 --> 31:10.033
I'll see if I can get
this stuff moved over.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.903
Definitely the kitchen
countertops have seen

31:12.905 --> 31:16.173
<i>better days and it's been
covered for a while.</i>

31:17.408 --> 31:20.410
[Amy speaking]

31:23.548 --> 31:27.651
We see evidence
of rodents and bugs.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.319
And what about
the stuff up above

31:29.321 --> 31:30.721
where Michael is washing?

31:30.723 --> 31:32.089
Do you use that stuff?

31:32.091 --> 31:33.924
I mean it's sentimental but...

31:33.926 --> 31:35.392
Okay.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.660
Then, again,
it could be donated...

31:36.662 --> 31:38.428
So, do you want it
in home decor or donate?

31:38.430 --> 31:40.530
- Donate.
- Donate it. Okay.

31:40.532 --> 31:43.533
[Amy speaking]

31:51.809 --> 31:53.977
Oh, it was, it was.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.982
[Amy speaking]

31:58.984 --> 32:02.252
It is gross, it's disgusting.
I don't know if it's alive.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.221
I don't know
if it's gonna bite my ass.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.090
- [Amy speaking]
- [Amy Payne] Yes.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.293
[Amy speaking]

32:11.162 --> 32:15.599
It is so embarrassing because
I have people at my house.

32:15.601 --> 32:18.835
I'm coming Gage, hold on.
Okay.

32:20.805 --> 32:22.706
I feel
like we need to concentrate

32:22.708 --> 32:25.042
on the baby stuff for the bins.

32:25.044 --> 32:26.810
Okay.

32:26.812 --> 32:29.846
[Amy speaking]

32:33.618 --> 32:34.918
[Amy sobbing]

32:34.920 --> 32:37.354
[Amy speaking]

32:42.193 --> 32:44.828
[Michael] Mmm-hmm.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.931
[Amy speaking]

33:14.359 --> 33:17.094
[Michael] [indistinct]

33:29.574 --> 33:32.576
[Amy speaking]

34:02.240 --> 34:04.875
[tense music playing]

34:04.877 --> 34:06.877
All right. Let's see
what you weight, okay?

34:06.879 --> 34:09.046
- [Tammy] Mmm-hmm.
- All right.

34:09.048 --> 34:11.615
<i>[Chris] Tammy is not doing
what she needed to do.</i>

34:11.617 --> 34:14.284
She's in a relationship
with a dude

34:14.286 --> 34:18.955
that's not got Tammy's
best interest at heart.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.490
Let's step up here on the scale.

34:22.026 --> 34:25.529
<i>[Tammy] Last time I weight
with Chris, I was 624.</i>

34:25.531 --> 34:28.865
I'm hoping I've lost even more
and I'm closer to my 550 goal.

34:28.867 --> 34:31.902
[tense music playing]

34:39.577 --> 34:41.545
[Dr. Smith]
Okay, looks like 639.

34:45.049 --> 34:47.417
[Tammy speaking]

34:47.419 --> 34:49.453
[Producer speaking]

34:58.596 --> 35:00.097
[Dr. Smith]
Go ahead and step off.

35:07.738 --> 35:10.373
<i>[Chris] This is...
[bleep] ...unbelievable.</i>

35:10.375 --> 35:13.443
<i>Tammy gained about 15 pounds
than what it was</i>

35:13.445 --> 35:16.813
<i>that Tammy's three weeks ago,
so it sucks.</i>

35:18.249 --> 35:20.350
She's pushing precious time away

35:20.352 --> 35:21.818
that she really ain't got.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.122
So, what do you think?

35:25.124 --> 35:28.058
Is that what you were expecting?

35:28.060 --> 35:30.026
Little up?

35:30.028 --> 35:32.295
<i>What happened
is what I was afraid of.</i>

35:32.297 --> 35:34.598
<i>Tammy left rehab too soon.</i>

35:34.600 --> 35:37.200
She needs to get
more strict about eating

35:37.202 --> 35:39.936
the right foods
in the right amounts,

35:39.938 --> 35:41.805
<i>because at Tammy's
current weight,</i>

35:41.807 --> 35:45.108
she's in big danger
of having a cardiac event,

35:45.110 --> 35:47.177
a pulmonary event.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.846
<i>We already know she has
underlying kidney disease.</i>

35:49.848 --> 35:52.315
Tammy is gonna die
if she doesn't do something

35:52.317 --> 35:54.451
about the weight.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.486
What things do we have
in place now

35:56.488 --> 36:00.090
that you're home
in regards to food,

36:00.092 --> 36:04.861
buying, cooking, selection,
all that stuff?

36:04.863 --> 36:07.264
Um, well, Amy still goes get...

36:07.266 --> 36:08.732
- My sister.
- [Dr. Smith] Mmm-hmm.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.233
Still goes to get
some groceries for me.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.702
But I've cut out all carbs.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.572
I...

36:15.574 --> 36:17.574
There's only
like fruits, and vegetables,

36:17.576 --> 36:19.442
and like [indistinct]

36:19.444 --> 36:21.011
- [Dr. Smith] Okay.
- And cheese.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.145
[Dr. Smith] All right.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.587
[Dr. Smith] Was it a cheat day
where you asked her

36:30.589 --> 36:32.389
and said Amy,
will you go get me this?

36:37.128 --> 36:39.362
<i>[Dr. Smith] I'm pretty
frustrated today with Tammy.</i>

36:39.364 --> 36:42.632
She did make progressed in rehab

36:42.634 --> 36:45.368
and that was
the intention of that.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.637
But rehab is not real life.

36:47.639 --> 36:50.373
<i>I want Tammy to show herself,</i>

36:50.375 --> 36:52.909
<i>as well as me that she can do</i>

36:52.911 --> 36:57.013
some basic requests to lose
some weight on her own

36:57.015 --> 36:58.882
and be motivated enough
to do that,

36:58.884 --> 37:00.884
so she can have surgery.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.086
When I met you
the very first time,

37:03.088 --> 37:05.155
we were aiming right
for around 550.

37:05.157 --> 37:07.090
- [Tammy] Mmm-hmm.
- So, what we've got to do

37:07.092 --> 37:08.825
- is we've got to head there.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.394
In a short amount of time,
we can lose some success

37:11.396 --> 37:12.862
and we don't want that
to happen.

37:12.864 --> 37:15.065
- [Tammy] Mmm-hmm.
- You need some help.

37:15.067 --> 37:19.536
And so we need to set you up
with a new counselor,

37:19.538 --> 37:22.772
somebody who focuses
on food addictions and things.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.244
[Tammy speaking]

37:42.560 --> 37:45.795
Be as honest as you can. Okay?

37:45.797 --> 37:48.965
Um, you got to expose
everything that you can

37:48.967 --> 37:51.735
to them and what
you're struggling with.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.404
<i>Seeing a therapist for Tammy
is vital for her success.</i>

37:54.406 --> 37:56.806
That's required
for anyone going through

37:56.808 --> 37:59.075
the process to have
surgical weight loss,

37:59.077 --> 38:02.612
but specifically, for Tammy
and her food addiction.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.415
All right.
So, starting tomorrow,

38:05.417 --> 38:08.218
I need you to give me 75 steps
every day.

38:08.220 --> 38:09.886
- [Tammy] Okay.
- And I want to see you

38:09.888 --> 38:11.788
lose 25-lbs for me in a month.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.957
- Okay.
- The next time that I see you.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.559
I can't be there with you
every day. And you know what?

38:16.561 --> 38:19.095
This guy right here
whose tried to help you,

38:19.097 --> 38:21.631
he's got to look out
for himself.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.433
If this was Vegas,

38:23.435 --> 38:25.402
would you bet
on yourself right now?

38:26.570 --> 38:28.905
All right.
You have to want this

38:30.341 --> 38:32.475
bad enough
to do whatever it takes.

38:37.982 --> 38:41.051
[tense music playing]

38:52.530 --> 38:53.963
<i>Me and Michael have been trying</i>

38:53.965 --> 38:56.466
<i>to organize the house
for a while now.</i>

38:56.468 --> 38:59.369
<i>So, we bring in home organizers</i>

38:59.371 --> 39:01.037
<i>to help us get organized.</i>

39:01.039 --> 39:03.673
But with all the mice
and the bugs,

39:03.675 --> 39:05.842
I just don't think
I can cope with it.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.684
[Michael speaking]

39:29.800 --> 39:32.635
So, I see
you're a little bit emotional.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.304
How are you doing?

39:34.306 --> 39:37.340
[Amy speaking]

39:38.909 --> 39:40.710
Yeah? Okay.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.481
[Amy speaking]

39:44.483 --> 39:46.149
You know
we aren't judging you, right?

39:46.151 --> 39:48.485
- [Jamie] Right.
- Yeah. I guess, I'm...

39:48.487 --> 39:49.886
Uh, I don't know.

39:49.888 --> 39:51.354
It's my in my headspace,
I guess.

39:51.356 --> 39:54.391
[Amy speaking]

39:57.261 --> 40:00.263
[dramatic music playing]

40:01.265 --> 40:03.700
I can't have a person here

40:03.702 --> 40:05.869
so you all can see
what I'm doing.

40:05.871 --> 40:08.905
[Amy speaking]

40:28.559 --> 40:30.593
[Amy Payer] Ow.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.662
[Amy crying]

40:55.653 --> 40:57.654
[Producer speaking]

41:07.798 --> 41:08.932
[Amy Payer] Yeah.

41:12.069 --> 41:14.437
[Amy Payer] Right.

41:14.439 --> 41:15.738
[Amy Payer] Right.

41:19.743 --> 41:21.611
Yeah. Yeah.

41:26.650 --> 41:29.352
<i>[Tammy] Next time
on 1000-lb Sisters.</i>

41:29.354 --> 41:31.221
<i>[Amy] How was
the doctor's appointment?</i>

41:31.223 --> 41:33.022
She gained 15 damn lbs.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.390
<i>[Amy] What the hell?</i>

41:34.392 --> 41:36.726
You know what the hell.
You helped her on cheat days.

41:45.536 --> 41:47.270
I'm not her mother.

41:47.272 --> 41:50.173
I cannot lose
this weight for her.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.943
<i>[Tammy] This is our first
hometown meet and greet.</i>

41:53.945 --> 41:56.846
It's weird seeing people
I went to school with.

41:56.848 --> 42:01.484
I'm kinda scared
because people are crazy.

42:01.486 --> 42:03.286
[Tisa] You're gonna
walk that far.

42:03.288 --> 42:04.854
- Yes, you can.
- [Tammy] I'm not walking.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.156
Just walk to the damn car.
[bleep]

42:07.158 --> 42:08.558
<i>[Tammy] I'm really mad at her.</i>

42:08.560 --> 42:10.527
She knew
what she was gonna get into.

42:10.529 --> 42:12.195
I mean, she took this job.

42:12.197 --> 42:15.131
There's people
with no legs tries to walk.

42:15.133 --> 42:16.799
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

42:16.801 --> 42:19.502

when I know

42:19.504 --> 42:22.171
she can get up and do things.

42:22.173 --> 42:25.174
Everybody can't be broken
down and I'm not gonna do it.
