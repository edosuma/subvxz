Shh, shh. Hey, hey...

00:57.766 --> 00:58.975
[Kiki in Spanish]
Drop the gun.

Hey, don't move! Don't move!

01:23.083 --> 01:24.250
Cuff him!

01:25.085 --> 01:27.045
-Clear?
-[officer] Yes. All clear!

01:27.128 --> 01:31.007
Gentlemen. Clear!
Let's bring it down. Let's go!

01:32.050 --> 01:33.551
[officer 2] Let's go.

01:33.635 --> 01:37.305
[in English] Wow. These guys, uh...
they didn't put up much of a fight.

01:37.388 --> 01:38.223
[chuckles]

01:38.306 --> 01:39.307
How much, you think?

01:39.390 --> 01:42.519
[man 2] 250 pounds.
Not more. Maybe a little less.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.145
Same as they give us every month.

01:44.854 --> 01:45.814
So this is a set-up?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.483
It's more like a donation.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.944
Locals get a win,
a little piece of the action.

01:51.402 --> 01:52.445
Everyone's happy.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.573
[horse whinnies]

[snorting]

I'm gonna see if I can calm him down.

02:00.787 --> 02:01.621
[horse whinnies]

02:03.706 --> 02:05.041
Butch is a horse man.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.212

More of a ladies man myself.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.223
[officers chattering in Spanish]

02:25.311 --> 02:27.939
[indistinct chattering over radio]

02:38.449 --> 02:39.367
[man 2] Kiki.

02:39.909 --> 02:41.202
Come look at this.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.749
Entry wounds are at least a day old.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.419
But our friend the captain says
that they just shot them

02:49.502 --> 02:50.920
when they were trying to escape.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.548
Sounds like more fish stories for
the gringos.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.633
[man 1 in Spanish]
Excuse me.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.051
Go ahead, Captain.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.346
[sighs]

03:02.640 --> 03:04.184
[man 1 in English]
Recognize him, Jaime?

03:05.685 --> 03:06.728
Hernan Naranjo.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.355
He runs a lot of the Guadalajara trade.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.442
We found his brother dead yesterday at
the Hotel Americas.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.359
[in Spanish] Really?

03:14.903 --> 03:16.821
[in English] Someone's moving on
their territory?

03:19.407 --> 03:20.408
Let's walk.

03:25.788 --> 03:29.667
Yeah, there's not much rhyme or reason
in the pecking order around here, Kiki.

03:29.751 --> 03:33.087
Just backwood dirtbags
growing ditch weed on half an acre

03:33.171 --> 03:35.256
and every once in a while
killing each other.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.092
Best we can do is hold tight
and ride through the bullshit.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.178
Take what they give us.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.764
[horse whinnies]

03:42.847 --> 03:43.681
[gunshot]

03:47.268 --> 03:48.478
Motherfuckers.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.107
Sorry, bud.
Ain't like you could've rode her home.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.193
[car engine starts]

04:06.579 --> 04:09.415
[Rodrigo Amarante's "Tuyo" playing]

05:35.168 --> 05:37.170
[narrator] Life 101.

05:37.253 --> 05:41.132
All plants, even marijuana,
exist to make seeds.

05:41.215 --> 05:44.010
But sinsemilla flips that on its head.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.389
Starts with a female plant that flowers
without ever being pollinated.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.808
Kind of like the immaculate conception.

05:50.892 --> 05:54.062
But instead of baby Jesus,
you get bigger buds,

05:54.145 --> 05:55.980
packing more THC,

05:56.064 --> 05:59.484
making it the gold standard of
Mexican dope.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.362
But cross-pollination
can ruin an entire crop,

06:02.904 --> 06:06.741
so growing it outside is impossible
unless you're in the middle of a desert,

06:06.824 --> 06:08.743
which presents its own challenges...

06:09.202 --> 06:10.370
'cause it's a fucking desert.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.248
[man in Spanish]
Rafa, you have a call.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.501
They're dying, Cuco.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.339
They're waiting, brother.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.387
[norteño music playing]

06:29.555 --> 06:31.474
[explosion]

06:31.557 --> 06:34.227
Manuel! What are you doing, asshole?

06:34.310 --> 06:36.729
-Put that shit away.
-Yeah, Rafa.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.773
[Rafa]
What the fuck are you doing, idiot?

06:40.024 --> 06:42.485
We're growing the shit, not smoking it.

06:44.278 --> 06:45.738
Fucking weed.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.456
Yeah.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.918
-What's wrong with the weed?
-That geologist was full of shit.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.380
There's not enough water, Miguel.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.132
So find some, Rafael.

07:06.551 --> 07:09.220
We're setting up the biggest marijuana
distribution network

07:09.303 --> 07:10.638
in the history of Mexico.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.016
It won't mean shit if we don't have weed.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.727
Fix this, brother.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.020
[dial tone drones]

07:26.904 --> 07:28.030
This the pilot?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.408
Amado, my nephew.

07:31.742 --> 07:35.371
Has a good head on his shoulders.
Worked as a cop for awhile.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.165
Been helping me out.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.626
-Hey! You have a license?
-Sure, man.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.753
What kind you looking for?

07:44.005 --> 07:44.881
Let's go.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.549
How's the plantation?

07:46.841 --> 07:47.967
[Félix] Great.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.345
Weed up to your eyeballs.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.640
First Juárez,
then I'll tell you where's next.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.563
[engine starts]

08:01.647 --> 08:05.067
[narrator in English] Looking back,
even knowing how it all turned out,

08:05.151 --> 08:09.238
it's still hard to comprehend the scale
of Miguel Félix Gallardo's dream.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.823
The fucking audacity of it.

08:11.407 --> 08:15.286
But if you're gonna try, you need to know
that before the cartels existed,

08:15.369 --> 08:17.288
things worked differently in Mexico.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.458
The narcotics game was made
of lone wolf traffickers,

08:20.541 --> 08:23.336
mostly Sinaloans,
who purchased permission from the cops

08:23.419 --> 08:26.130
to run drugs
in a particular city or territory.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.048
MEXICO

08:27.131 --> 08:29.550
They called it the Plaza System.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.135
MEXICO CITY
GUADALAJARA

08:31.219 --> 08:32.637
Here's how it worked:

08:32.720 --> 08:34.931
Anyone looking to do business
in the territory

08:35.014 --> 08:36.432
had to cut in the plaza boss,

08:37.016 --> 08:39.101
pay him a piso, or a toll.

08:39.727 --> 08:44.273
And if they chose not to, trust me,
the boss made his displeasure known.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.569
But here's the key:
each plaza stood alone,

08:48.653 --> 08:51.322
was its own world,
run by a certified asshole

08:51.656 --> 08:55.201
who'd done enough dirt to get crowned
king of that particular piece of turf.

08:55.284 --> 08:57.537
The job tended to attract
hard motherfuckers.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.163
[grunting]

09:00.873 --> 09:03.960
So a scheme to convince
a bunch of rival plazas,

09:04.043 --> 09:07.296
led by trigger-happy sociopaths,
to work together,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.925
take direction from some other dirtbag?
Yeah, right.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.593
[in Spanish]
Good luck, friend.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.138
I mean it.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.156
[door opens]

09:34.240 --> 09:37.076
[in English] The baby's fine.
Mama needs a foot massage.

09:37.702 --> 09:38.536
Okay.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.374
[Kiki] We should find out the sex.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.085
It gives you a little time to
wrap your head around another boy.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.337
Oh, what makes you so sure
it's another boy?

09:49.547 --> 09:51.299
Oh, come on.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.426
Come on. I don't need to hear about
what a man you are

09:53.509 --> 09:55.303
and neither does our future daughter.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.220
[scoffs]

09:56.304 --> 09:58.472
I want to use the same formula
we gave Kikito.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.977
They can send it from Texas,
but it'll cost more.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.648
-You listening to me?
-Yeah.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.776
The doctors here are good
and the formula isn't.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.486
Oh, I missed my turn. Hold up.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.574
[horn honks]

10:41.098 --> 10:42.266
Where the hell are we?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.018
Uh...

10:44.769 --> 10:45.686
What are you doing?

10:45.770 --> 10:47.021
Hold up, hold on.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.901
Are you following someone?

10:51.984 --> 10:56.072
No, uh... Sears told me
that there's a good birria place nearby.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.200
I, uh... I must have heard wrong.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.911
Jesus, Kiki. On the way home from the OB?

11:02.703 --> 11:04.664
You never know when
you're gonna get lucky, right?

11:04.747 --> 11:08.000
Just don't get lucky when
you're picking up Kikito from school.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.301
[in Spanish]
Set the table for dinner.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.429
[in English]
Hey, that means make the table.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.598
[in Spanish]
We're going to speak more Spanish, Kikito.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.435
-[Kiki in English] Huh? Good luck.
-You're not staying for dinner?

11:26.519 --> 11:30.439
No, I gotta get back to the office, babe.
Kikito, where are your binoculars?

11:35.569 --> 11:36.612
Perfect.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.156
SCHOOL OF GEOLOGY

11:43.035 --> 11:45.037
[in Spanish]
And this is what makes the difference

11:45.121 --> 11:48.499
between permeable
and impermeable surfaces.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.338
Class is over.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.801
Didn't you hear, pussies?

11:58.884 --> 12:01.512
Get moving! Get the fuck out of here! Go!

12:01.595 --> 12:03.222
Fast. Move.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.807
[Cuco]
Come on. Let's go!

12:04.890 --> 12:07.685
Hurry up! Move it!

12:08.477 --> 12:10.479
Come on! Let's go!

12:12.440 --> 12:14.066

[Don Neto]
What's up, Pablo?

13:04.992 --> 13:06.577
Are the beers cold?

13:06.660 --> 13:07.745
[whistles]

13:09.497 --> 13:10.790
You look fatter, Don Neto.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.958
-[Don Neto] think so?
-Yeah.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.086

13:18.005 --> 13:19.215
Nah, man.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.299
[horse whinnies]

13:28.974 --> 13:30.893
[Pablo]
You're proposing a monopoly.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.770
[Félix]
We're producing more than anyone else.

13:32.853 --> 13:36.106
With good distribution,
we'll dominate the market.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.193
Once we control it, we set a fixed price.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.778
Our price.

13:41.570 --> 13:45.032
On top of that, we don't have to
worry about getting undercut.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.952
More profits will come.

13:48.035 --> 13:50.746
And little by little, more stability.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.248
Hmm.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.208
Like how the Arabs do, right?

13:55.042 --> 13:57.545
OPEC for weed.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.338
[chuckles]

13:59.421 --> 14:02.633
There you go. More or less. [chuckles]

14:02.716 --> 14:05.469
And with control, there won't be violence.

14:07.054 --> 14:10.349
Only works if every plaza signs up.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.517
Yeah.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.980
We just need the important ones.
Most of them we know.

14:17.481 --> 14:20.150
-Sinaloans.
-Yeah.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.694

14:23.612 --> 14:27.032
They're everywhere.
Fucking Jews of the mountains.

14:27.741 --> 14:31.078
No. We do business with any man
we trust and respect.

14:31.161 --> 14:34.456
Even if he's from a shit-stain
like Ojinaga.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.416
[horse neighs]

14:35.499 --> 14:39.879
-Hey! Don't pull too much! Slowly!
-Yes, boss.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.924
[Pablo] That nag cost me
a lot of fucking money, that asshole.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.344
You might have concerns.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.556
Why don't you come to our meeting
in Guadalajara?

14:50.639 --> 14:52.975
See what we can achieve together.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.614
You seem like a smart man, Miguel Ángel.
My problem is...

15:08.908 --> 15:09.867
your boss.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.411
He's not very smart.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.082
Pedro Avilés is not a man
you can do business with.

15:17.458 --> 15:21.086
We've had bad blood
over some bullshit for years.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.215
No, man.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.969
I don't think it would work.
I don't accept.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.060
I'm aware of your dispute. In fact...

15:36.518 --> 15:42.650
he asked me to let you know
he regrets his part in it.

15:44.693 --> 15:45.861
Look...

15:46.612 --> 15:48.238
those were his words.

15:49.031 --> 15:54.119
"Tell him that it's time to move forward."
That's what he said.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.511
I'll come to Guadalajara,
sit down with Avilés, the others.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.348
But if I don't see proof
you got the cops on board

16:14.431 --> 16:17.017
to grease this fucking OPEC thing?

16:19.687 --> 16:20.521
That'd be all.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.648
That's enough.

16:24.525 --> 16:25.818
Okay then, brother.

would take months, no?

18:22.810 --> 18:23.727
Yeah.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.107
What Acosta doesn't know won't hurt him.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.335
To make good on that, he had to sign up
enough bosses from the right plazas.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.381
And that meant convincing
some of the scariest dudes in Mexico

19:34.464 --> 19:36.091
to work together for once.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.604
Shit wasn't easy.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.941
But Félix grew up in Sinaloa.
He understood these guys.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.694
And he'd done his homework.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.907
That meant knowing which asshole
responded to flattery...

20:01.825 --> 20:04.536
and which just wanted to hear
the fucking numbers.

20:05.329 --> 20:09.291
But there was one thing each
and every one of them needed to know:

20:09.374 --> 20:13.128
That this idea of his was blessed
by the powers that be.

[narrator in English] After World War II,
Mexico's new president

21:18.944 --> 21:21.113
was eager to attract U.S. investment,

21:21.196 --> 21:23.282
which meant picking a side
in the Cold War.

21:24.074 --> 21:27.786
To prove Mexico could get tough on Ivan,
the DFS was created,

21:27.869 --> 21:32.582
which basically meant if the CIA
needed shit done in Mexico, DFS did it.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.586
Tapping phones, keeping an eye
on Soviet and Cuban diplomats,

21:36.670 --> 21:40.841

21:54.313 --> 21:58.525
Apparently that qualified them to provide
security for visiting American diplomats.

21:59.276 --> 22:05.240
Carrying a DFS badge was
a license to extort, traffick, murder...

22:05.699 --> 22:07.909
basically do whatever the fuck you wanted,

22:07.993 --> 22:10.329

52:58.592 --> 53:02.012
[Avilés] Fucking pigs.
Five hundred should do it.

53:04.681 --> 53:06.099
Identification.

53:08.435 --> 53:10.896
Call your boss if you want to know
who I am, asshole.

53:11.396 --> 53:12.689
You. Hands on the wheel.

53:13.148 --> 53:14.941
Hands on the wheel.

53:15.025 --> 53:18.486
Get out of the car.
The three of you as well. Come on!

53:20.572 --> 53:22.866
[Avilés]
You guys are making a mistake.

53:30.665 --> 53:33.084
How many mouths am I feeding tonight?

53:45.055 --> 53:46.556
Hey! What the fuck!

53:48.266 --> 53:49.351
Neto!

53:49.976 --> 53:52.270
What the hell! What's going on?

54:07.494 --> 54:09.496
I heard enough before I left.

54:10.789 --> 54:12.082
And...

54:12.958 --> 54:14.334
your friend...

54:15.001 --> 54:17.254
tells me he can't do it without you.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.883
[grunts]

54:24.135 --> 54:25.428
No, wait.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.347
[panting]

54:28.431 --> 54:29.599
Please.

54:40.068 --> 54:41.194
Boss.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.099
Grab the driver.

55:12.642 --> 55:15.061
Get out, motherfucker. Come on!

55:28.450 --> 55:29.826
You're from La Tuna, right?

55:32.746 --> 55:33.830
Your name?

55:34.664 --> 55:37.417
-Joaquín.
-We have a bunch of Joaquíns.

55:39.627 --> 55:40.879
What else do they call you?

55:43.173 --> 55:44.174
Chapo.

55:48.178 --> 55:50.013
You want to work for me?

55:52.891 --> 55:54.017
Okay, Chapo.

56:05.570 --> 56:07.447
You and I are partners now.

56:08.990 --> 56:10.492
You know what that means?

56:11.117 --> 56:12.077
Yes.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.164
Let's go.

56:23.129 --> 56:26.383
-Still driving you to Sinaloa?
-No.

56:28.593 --> 56:30.261
We're going back to Guadalajara.
