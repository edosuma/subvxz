YOUR FATHER HAS
A SPECIAL SOMEONE.

00:03.323 --> 00:04.925
WE GOTTA MAKE MONEY
OFF THIS PLACE.

00:04.925 --> 00:06.767
‐ BY DOING WHAT?
‐ WHAT ABOUT...

00:06.767 --> 00:07.848
A THEATER?

00:07.848 --> 00:08.929
THE CLOSET DOOR OPENED.

00:08.929 --> 00:10.290
HE SAYS HE'S MOVING
TO SAN JOSE,

00:10.290 --> 00:12.012
SHE SAYS SHE'S
MOVING TO ENCINO.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.253
I'M SUPPOSED TO PICK
WHERE I WANT TO GO.

00:13.253 --> 00:14.374
WE'RE BUILDING
AN AMPHITHEATER.

00:14.374 --> 00:15.896
NOW THIS
I'M INTERESTED IN.

00:15.896 --> 00:17.457
‐ YOU'RE INTERESTED IN?
‐ PARTNERING.

00:17.457 --> 00:19.540
‐ WHO GAVE YOU FLOWERPOTS?
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

00:19.540 --> 00:21.782
THIS IS MY BROTHER SCOTTY.
SCOTTY, THIS IS GODOT.

00:21.782 --> 00:22.863
WELL HELLO,
YOUNG MAN.

00:22.863 --> 00:24.865
SASHA'S AWOL TOO
BY THE WAY.

00:24.865 --> 00:25.946
WELL, I KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

00:25.946 --> 00:26.947
APARTMENT HUNTING.
AND SHE FOUND ONE.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.309
ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

00:29.309 --> 00:31.231
KEEP IT LIGHT,
WATCH YOUR SPACING.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.633
DANCE AS ONE.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.275
<i>( piano playing )</i>

00:35.275 --> 00:36.757
I'M THINKING OF
GETTING BANGS.

00:36.757 --> 00:37.798
OH YEAH?

00:37.798 --> 00:39.239
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:39.239 --> 00:41.281
YOU NEED A CHANGE?

00:41.281 --> 00:42.442
WELL, YEAH.

00:42.442 --> 00:43.764
YOUR LIFE IS BORING?

00:43.764 --> 00:45.566
‐ GINNY‐‐
‐ YOUR FRIENDS
ARE BORING?

00:45.566 --> 00:46.807
OH BOY.

00:46.807 --> 00:49.249
NEW LIFE,
NEW FRIENDS,

00:49.249 --> 00:50.651
NEW BANGS.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.453
MOVING THE FEET,
NOT THE MOUTHS, LADIES.

00:53.453 --> 00:55.335
GINNY PLEASE,
GET OVER THIS
COZETTE THING.

00:55.335 --> 00:56.977
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT ROLLER DERBY,

00:56.977 --> 00:58.458
BUT I DIDN'T
TELL ANYONE.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.340
NOT MY PARENTS
OR MY BROTHER.

01:00.340 --> 01:01.662
YOUR BROTHER?

01:01.662 --> 01:04.144
‐ I JUST MEAN‐‐
‐ YOU DIDN'T TELL CHARLIE?

01:04.144 --> 01:05.465
BUT YOU'RE SO
CLOSE WITH HIM.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.467
YOU TELL CHARLIE
EVERYTHING.

01:09.630 --> 01:12.793
‐ I WAS JUST‐‐
‐ I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
DIDN'T TELL CHARLIE.

01:12.793 --> 01:14.635
IF YOU DIDN'T
TELL CHARLIE,

01:14.635 --> 01:17.798
THEN CLEARLY,
I'M OVERREACTING.

01:17.798 --> 01:19.640
AREN'T I?

01:19.640 --> 01:21.401
AREN'T I OVERREACTING?

01:21.401 --> 01:23.644
‐ UH...
‐ THERE'S NO GOOD
ANSWER, BOO.

01:23.644 --> 01:26.647
SAY YOUR BEST FRIEND
SUDDENLY HAD A SECRET LIFE

01:26.647 --> 01:28.128
THAT YOU DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT.

01:28.128 --> 01:30.811
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT,
WOULD YOU FEEL MAD,
BETRAYED?

01:30.811 --> 01:32.653
LIKE MAYBE
YOUR BEST FRIEND
WASN'T ACTUALLY

01:32.653 --> 01:33.894
YOUR BEST FRIEND
AT ALL?

01:33.894 --> 01:35.335
‐ WELL‐‐
‐ OR...

01:35.335 --> 01:37.818
ONCE YOU FOUND OUT SHE DIDN'T
TELL HER BROTHER EITHER,

01:37.818 --> 01:39.980
WOULD YOU FEEL FINE
AND FORGET IT EVER HAPPENED?

01:39.980 --> 01:41.301
‐ I MISSED YOU.
‐ WHAT?

01:41.301 --> 01:43.664
Fanny: <i>A CLOSED MOUTH</i>
<i>IS A PRETTY MOUTH.</i>

01:43.664 --> 01:45.265
‐ SORRY.
‐ WHATEVER.

01:45.265 --> 01:47.788
I TALKED TO HER TWICE.
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

01:47.788 --> 01:49.389
‐ SHE NAMED YOU.
‐ COME ON.

01:49.389 --> 01:50.951
CLEO‐SMACKTRA?
HOW MANY SECONDS OF THOUGHT

01:50.951 --> 01:52.032
DID SHE PUT
INTO THAT ONE?

01:52.032 --> 01:53.473
ARE YOU GUYS
FIGHTING AGAIN?

01:53.473 --> 01:54.795
I DON'T KNOW.
I AM THE LAST ONE

01:54.795 --> 01:56.396
TO KNOW ANYTHING
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

01:56.396 --> 02:00.480
UNBELIEVABLE.
I TURN MY BACK
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.643
COZETTE JUST HAPPENED
TO BE AT THE RINK
WHEN I WAS THERE.

02:02.643 --> 02:03.804
IT'S NOT LIKE
I CALLED HER UP AND SAID

02:03.804 --> 02:05.646
"I'LL TELL YOU ALL
MY SECRETS, COZETTE."

02:05.646 --> 02:07.327
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
THE C‐WORD ANYMORE.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.969
OF COURSE,
RIGHT TO COZETTE.

02:08.969 --> 02:10.330
THAT'S THE CHOREOGRAPHY.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.252
SHE PROBABLY CAST SOME KIND
OF SPELL ON MADAME FANNY

02:12.252 --> 02:13.814
TO MAKE IT
HAPPEN LIKE THAT.

02:13.814 --> 02:16.256
COZETTE CAN DO ANYTHING.
COZETTE'S A WIZARD.

02:16.256 --> 02:18.258
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO HEAR THE C‐WORD?

02:18.258 --> 02:19.820
I'M SORRY ABOUT GINNY.

02:19.820 --> 02:21.742
I LOVE HER,
BUT SHE'S STUBBORN.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.263
JUST GIVE HER TIME.

02:23.263 --> 02:24.665
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

02:24.665 --> 02:25.826
WHO'S GINNY?

02:25.826 --> 02:27.788
SHE'S MAGIC
AND PERFECT,

02:27.788 --> 02:30.230
AND WORLDLY,
AND SO SO HIP.

02:30.230 --> 02:32.232
SHE'S CARNABY STREET
IN POINTE SHOES.

02:32.232 --> 02:34.635
WHEN DID WE EVEN
MEET COZETTE?

02:34.635 --> 02:35.716
I'M COZETTE.

02:41.642 --> 02:43.684
<i>( piano song ends )</i>

02:43.684 --> 02:46.406
WHAT A WONDERFUL
FIRST TRY.

02:46.406 --> 02:49.249
<i>IT REMINDS ME OF A TIME</i>
<i>WHEN I WAS A YOUNG SOLOIST</i>

02:49.249 --> 02:50.651
<i>IN "LES SYLPHIDES"</i>

02:50.651 --> 02:51.972
AND I WAS HAVING
A TERRIBLE FIGHT

02:51.972 --> 02:53.413
WITH A NYMPH‐‐

02:53.413 --> 02:55.656
OR A NYMPHO, WHICH IS
A MORE ACCURATE DESCRIPTION

02:55.656 --> 02:57.658
AND THE ACTUAL REASON
FOR OUR FIGHT.

02:57.658 --> 03:00.821
ANYHOW WE WOUND UP HAVING
WORDS DURING REHEARSAL.

03:00.821 --> 03:02.823
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:02.823 --> 03:06.547
WE BOTH WATCHED OPENING NIGHT
FROM THE CONCESSION STAND
IN THE LOBBY.

03:07.908 --> 03:10.350
SO WITH THAT IN MIND...

03:11.952 --> 03:13.954
<i>( piano music playing )</i>

03:19.800 --> 03:22.002
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

04:22.823 --> 04:24.745
OH, I FORGOT.

04:24.745 --> 04:25.826
I BROUGHT
MY OWN BAGS.

04:25.826 --> 04:27.908
‐ LET'S GO.
‐ ( groaning )

04:27.908 --> 04:29.269
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.430
COULD YOU GUYS
OPEN UP ANOTHER REGISTER?

04:30.430 --> 04:31.672
COME ON.

04:32.793 --> 04:34.795
AND THAT'S THE STAGE

04:34.795 --> 04:36.637
WITH SEATING
ALL AROUND.

04:36.637 --> 04:38.879
OH, AND WE'RE GOING
TO HANG LANTERNS

04:38.879 --> 04:40.120
IN ALL THE TREES.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.442
THEY'LL BE DIMMED
BEFORE THE PERFORMANCES.

04:42.442 --> 04:44.204
PRETTY. NO,
NOT YOU, SAUL.

04:44.204 --> 04:45.806
WHY WOULD I
CALL YOU PRETTY?

04:45.806 --> 04:47.207
I HOPE THE STAGE
IS BIG ENOUGH.

04:47.207 --> 04:48.569
DO YOU THINK THE STAGE
IS BIG ENOUGH?

04:48.569 --> 04:49.970
FOR THE HALFTIME SHOW, OR?

04:49.970 --> 04:51.411
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S FINE.

04:51.411 --> 04:52.893
WHOA, HEY.
IF YOU NEED A BIGGER STAGE,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.054
LET'S MAKE
A BIGGER STAGE.

04:54.054 --> 04:55.415
THEY'RE TWO WEEKS
LATE ON RENT.

04:55.415 --> 04:57.217
GO FIND SOMEONE THAT
SPEAKS LITHUANIAN DEADBEAT

04:57.217 --> 04:58.218
AND TELL THEM
TO GET OUT.

04:58.218 --> 04:59.900
‐ I AM SO EXCITED.
‐ I KNOW.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.141
I'M WEARING
THAT SHIRT YOU HATE

05:01.141 --> 05:02.422
AND YOU HAVEN'T ASKED ME
WHAT BUM I HAD TO ROLL

05:02.422 --> 05:03.824
TO GET IT YET.

05:03.824 --> 05:05.065
WHAT DO YOU GIRLS
THINK OF THE STAGE?

05:05.065 --> 05:06.226
IT'S REALLY COOL.

05:06.226 --> 05:07.828
I'VE NEVER DANCED
OUTSIDE BEFORE.

05:07.828 --> 05:09.670
IF THE STAGE IS
GONNA BE BIGGER,

05:09.670 --> 05:11.351
WE HAVE TO TELL
FAT BOB AND SKINNY DON.

05:11.351 --> 05:13.714
Fanny: <i>AND I SWORE TO THEM THAT</i>
<i>WE'D FINALIZED EVERYTHING.</i>

05:13.714 --> 05:15.395
THIS WILL NOT
MAKE THEM HAPPY.

05:15.395 --> 05:17.798
LADIES, WE ARE NOT
HERE TO MAKE THEM HAPPY.

05:17.798 --> 05:19.199
THIS IS FOR US
AND THE KIDS.

05:19.199 --> 05:21.401
HEY! FAT BOB
AND SKINNY DON.

05:21.401 --> 05:23.043
OH, WE DON'T USUALLY
CALL THEM THAT TO THEIR FACE.

05:23.043 --> 05:25.125
‐ IS SOMETHING WRONG?
‐ WE WANT TO MAKE
THE STAGE BIGGER.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.326
THEY WANT TO MAKE
THE STAGE BIGGER.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.327
WE ALREADY
ORDERED THE WOOD.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.408
LAST WEEK.

05:28.408 --> 05:29.730
MADE THE CALL,
WROTE THE CHECK.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.891
WELL, CAN YOU ORDER MORE,

05:30.891 --> 05:32.573
OR IS THAT THE LAST
WOOD IN THE WORLD?

05:32.573 --> 05:34.214
UH, YEAH, THE SARCASM
HAS NOT GONE UNNOTICED.

05:34.214 --> 05:36.857
BUT SEE, NOW,
THERE'S GONNA BE
SOME LAG TIME.

05:36.857 --> 05:38.458
‐ TWO, THREE...
‐ FOUR, FIVE...

05:38.458 --> 05:39.499
‐ WEEKS.
‐ MONTHS.

05:39.499 --> 05:40.861
‐ MONTHS?
‐ COME ON.

05:40.861 --> 05:42.863
GIVE ME THE BOTTOM LINE HERE,
FAT BOB AND SKINNY DON.

05:42.863 --> 05:43.944
OH, JEEZ, WELL‐‐

05:43.944 --> 05:45.506
SAVE IT FOR SPIELBERG, OLIVIER.

05:45.506 --> 05:46.827
‐ GIVE ME THE NUMBER.
‐ 10.

05:46.827 --> 05:47.828
‐ 10?
‐ DONE.

05:47.828 --> 05:48.989
AND YOU KNOW,
A BIGGER STAGE

05:48.989 --> 05:50.070
IS GONNA NEED
MORE LIGHTS.

05:50.070 --> 05:51.672
‐ FINE.
‐ THAT MEANS TWO...

05:51.672 --> 05:53.073
‐ THREE...
‐ FOUR EXTRA BANKS.

05:53.073 --> 05:54.915
‐ DO IT.
‐ WAIT, MILLY,

05:54.915 --> 05:56.637
THAT'S TOO MUCH.
WE DON'T NEED MORE LIGHTS.

05:56.637 --> 05:57.878
YEAH, WE'LL JUST
SHOVE THE UGLY KIDS

05:57.878 --> 05:58.959
IN THE DARK SPOTS.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.641
MORE LIGHTS WILL
MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL.

06:00.641 --> 06:01.882
IT HAS TO
BE BEAUTIFUL.

06:01.882 --> 06:03.804
EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL
AT THE BALLET.

06:03.804 --> 06:04.965
YOU DONE
FLEECING ME YET?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.807
‐ PROBABLY NOT.
‐ GO BUILD SOMETHING.

06:06.807 --> 06:08.569
WELL, IF WE'RE
GETTING NOISE COMPLAINTS

06:08.569 --> 06:10.050
TELL THEM THEY CAN'T
RUN THEIR HEART‐LUNG
MACHINE

06:10.050 --> 06:11.131
<i>BETWEEN 10:00 AND 6:00.</i>

06:11.131 --> 06:12.573
MICHELLE,
I HAVE TO SAY

06:12.573 --> 06:14.575
IT WAS A STROKE OF GENIUS
GETTING MILLY

06:14.575 --> 06:15.736
INVOLVED WITH THIS.

06:15.736 --> 06:17.097
WOW, THANKS.

06:17.097 --> 06:19.219
AND THAT SHIRT MAKES YOU
LOOK LIKE A FREEWAY UNDERPASS.

06:19.219 --> 06:21.061
Milly:
<i>TELL ME AGAIN THE TOTAL</i>
<i>PROFIT AFTER EXPENSES.</i>

06:21.061 --> 06:23.664
( laughing )
TELL ME AGAIN.

06:23.664 --> 06:24.825
I LOVE MONEY.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.068
LET ME JUST
GET YOU THOSE CHECKS

06:28.068 --> 06:29.750
AND I'LL GET
OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

06:29.750 --> 06:30.991
IS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE WE NEED?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.754
OH, NO. YOU'VE BEEN AN
ABSOLUTE GODSEND, MILLY.

06:33.754 --> 06:35.075
REALLY. EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE HAS BEEN

06:35.075 --> 06:36.517
JUST ABOUT PERFECT.

06:36.517 --> 06:37.718
JUST ABOUT?

06:37.718 --> 06:39.159
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"JUST ABOUT?"

06:39.159 --> 06:41.201
NO. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.884
THE COSTUMES THE PARENTS
ARE MAKING ARE GOING TO
BE LOVELY.

06:43.884 --> 06:45.886
WE WON'T EVEN MISS
THE PROFESSIONALLY
MADE ONES.

06:45.886 --> 06:46.927
SHOULDN'T WE HAVE THOSE?

06:46.927 --> 06:48.889
WELL, IN A PERFECT WORLD.

06:48.889 --> 06:50.010
I LIVE IN
A PERFECT WORLD.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.491
I THINK
WE'LL BE FINE.

06:51.491 --> 06:53.654
LOOK, IF I SPEND
ALL THIS MONEY
ON A THEATER

06:53.654 --> 06:54.895
AND THEN THE DANCERS
SHOW UP LOOKING LIKE

06:54.895 --> 06:56.496
A BUS AND TRUCK
TOUR OF "OLIVER,"

06:56.496 --> 06:58.418
I MIGHT AS WELL
BE INVESTING IN
PUBLIC TELEVISION.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.340
‐ ORDER THE COSTUMES.
‐ ARE YOU SURE?

07:00.340 --> 07:01.662
I AM POSITIVE.

07:01.662 --> 07:02.983
YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

07:02.983 --> 07:04.985
THESE BEAUTIFUL COSTUMES
WILL PUT THOSE

OUTFITS TO SHAME.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.228
SO EVIL.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.910
USHERS. DO WE HAVE THOSE?

07:09.910 --> 07:12.432
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE DON'T NEED THEM.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
SMART.
YOU SEE, MICHELLE?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.517
THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE
A BUSINESS PARTNER FOR.

07:16.517 --> 07:18.519
TO TELL YOU EXACTLY
WHERE TO CUT THE COSTS.

07:18.519 --> 07:19.520
NO USHERS.

07:20.801 --> 07:22.643

SIX MONTHS.

07:23.724 --> 07:25.205
NOW, I WANT THEM NOW.
HOW MANY?

07:25.205 --> 07:27.487
‐ 10?
‐ 20.

07:27.487 --> 07:28.969
20 USHERS,

07:35.896 --> 07:37.978
I UNDERSTAND YOUR
RELIGIOUS TRADITION

07:37.978 --> 07:39.660
CALLS FOR HANGING
A LOT OF PARAPHERNALIA,

07:39.660 --> 07:40.861
BUT IT'S DESTROYING
MY WALLS.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.743
I MEAN, IT'S THREE NAILS
FOR EVERY CRUCIFIX.

07:42.743 --> 07:44.505

07:44.505 --> 07:45.666

‐ WE'RE PERFECT.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.307
AND EVIL.

07:47.307 --> 07:49.670
GOOD‐BYE, MILLY.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.232
COSTUMES,
USHER UNIFORMS,

07:52.232 --> 07:53.514
USHERS.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.675
WE NEED
ALL THOSE THINGS.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.836
I'M JUST WONDERING,

07:55.836 --> 07:57.237
ARE YOU PUTTING OUT
FOR ALL OF THIS?

07:57.237 --> 07:58.398
'CAUSE THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOME SORT OF

07:58.398 --> 08:00.320
QUID PRO QUO
GOING ON HERE.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.802
DON'T BE VULGAR.

08:01.802 --> 08:03.363
I'M DOING IT
FOR THE ART.

08:03.363 --> 08:04.645
AND FOR THE CHILDREN.

08:04.645 --> 08:05.886
HEY, I'M NOT JUDGING.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.287
AS LONG AS THE LADY'S
PAYING FOR IT,

08:07.287 --> 08:08.809
WHY NOT TAKE
THE VICUNA?

08:10.811 --> 08:12.893
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BEGIN.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.134
FIRST POSITION,
<i>PLIES.</i>

08:17.858 --> 08:19.099
‐ RAINCOAT?
‐ BRING IT.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.701
‐ BIKINI?
‐ BRING IT.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.902
‐ PAJAMA JEANS?
‐ BRING THEM.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.784
‐ HANDCUFFS?
‐ TOSS THEM IN.

08:23.784 --> 08:26.146
HARD HAT, WAFFLE IRON,
BANANARAMA BOX SET?

08:26.146 --> 08:27.628
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
GONNA DO WITH A WAFFLE IRON?

08:27.628 --> 08:29.630
SCOTTY, COME ON.
TELL ME WHAT THIS THING IS.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.031
HEY, IT'S MY LAST NIGHT.

08:31.031 --> 08:32.633
AND THE RULES ARE
WHOEVER HAS THE LAST NIGHT

08:32.633 --> 08:34.955
GETS TO CHOOSE
THE LAST NIGHT
BLOWOUT ACTIVITY.

08:34.955 --> 08:37.037
‐ DON'T FLOUT THE RULES.
‐ BUT I NEED DETAILS.

08:37.037 --> 08:38.278
I TOLD YOU,
IT'S IN THE DESERT.

08:38.278 --> 08:40.521
‐ IT'S LIKE BURNING MAN.
‐ WHICH MEANS NOTHING.

08:40.521 --> 08:42.563
‐ YOU'VE HEARD OF BURNING MAN.
‐ YES, I'VE HEARD
OF BURNING MAN,

08:42.563 --> 08:44.004
BUT SINCE I'VE NEVER
BEEN TO BURNING MAN,

08:44.004 --> 08:45.405
I CAN ONLY GUESS
WHAT TAKES PLACE.

08:45.405 --> 08:46.687
LIKE DO THEY
REALLY BURN A MAN?

08:46.687 --> 08:48.128
AND WHO IS THIS MAN?
IS HE ANNOYING?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.090
‐ DOES HE HAVE IT COMING?
‐ YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT.

08:50.090 --> 08:51.331
OKAY, WELL AT LEAST
ANSWER ME THIS.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.933
WHEN WE GET THERE,
WILL THERE BE A BATHROOM?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.334
DEFINE BATHROOM.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.336
( sighs )
NICE SEEING YOU.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.337
CALL ME WHEN
YOU GET HOME.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.859
OH, COME ON.
DID I COMPLAIN

08:58.859 --> 09:00.340
WHEN YOU VISITED ME
AND MADE ME GO SEE

09:00.340 --> 09:01.782
DRAG QUEEN BINGO?

09:01.782 --> 09:02.943
VEHEMENTLY.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.344
'CAUSE IT WAS HORRIBLE
AND I LOST.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.786
YEAH, THAT WAS FUN.

09:05.786 --> 09:07.027
WELL, COME ON,
THIS WILL BE FUN TOO.

09:07.027 --> 09:08.869
COME ON, IT'LL BE LIKE
ALL THOSE COOL ROAD TRIPS

09:08.869 --> 09:09.910
WE TOOK AS KIDS.

09:09.910 --> 09:10.991
WHAT COOL ROAD TRIPS?

09:10.991 --> 09:12.953
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THE GRAND CANYON,

09:12.953 --> 09:14.314
NEW ORLEANS,
SUN STUDIOS,

09:14.314 --> 09:15.676
THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS.

09:15.676 --> 09:18.278
‐ FAKE.
‐ SMOKY MOUNTAINS
ARE FAKE?

09:18.278 --> 09:19.560
THE TRIPS WERE FAKE.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.001
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:21.001 --> 09:22.723
MOM USED TO TAKE US
ON FAKE TRIPS.

09:22.723 --> 09:24.444
‐ YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?
‐ NO.

09:24.444 --> 09:26.086
SHE'D PUT US IN THE CAR
REALLY LATE AT NIGHT

09:26.086 --> 09:27.688
AND THEN DRIVE US
AROUND FOR HOURS

09:27.688 --> 09:29.329
UNTIL WE FELL ASLEEP.
AND THEN WHEN WE WOKE UP,

09:29.329 --> 09:31.932
SHE'D CONVINCE US
THAT WE JUST HAD
A REALLY FUN ADVENTURE.

09:31.932 --> 09:33.333
NO. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.455
I REMEMBER THAT THING
WITH THE BALLOONS.

09:35.455 --> 09:37.017
‐ NEVER HAPPENED.
‐ YES.

09:37.017 --> 09:38.979
THERE WERE LIKE THESE
HUGE RED BALLOONS

09:38.979 --> 09:40.260
WITH RIBBONS
HANGING DOWN.

09:40.260 --> 09:42.182
‐ I'M AFRAID NOT.
‐ THE WIND KICKED UP

09:42.182 --> 09:44.344
AND WE HELD THE RIBBONS
AND WE RODE ON THEM?

09:46.787 --> 09:49.510
‐ NO BALLOONS?
‐ SHE GASLIGHTED US, DUDE.

09:49.510 --> 09:51.351
THAT WAS MY SECOND FAVORITE
CHILDHOOD MEMORY.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.996
DON McLEAN DIDN'T PLAY
YOUR FIFTH BIRTHDAY PARTY.

09:58.118 --> 10:00.120
I'LL GIVE YOU
SOME SPACE.

10:07.688 --> 10:09.930
I JUST MOVED IN
SO I NEED TO GET
THE POWER TURNED ON.

10:09.930 --> 10:11.932
BY TOMORROW WOULD BE
GREAT ACTUALLY.

10:11.932 --> 10:13.934
A CREDIT CARD?
WELL, I DO.

10:13.934 --> 10:15.415
I MEAN, IT'S TECHNICALLY
MY PARENTS',

10:15.415 --> 10:17.337
BUT THEY TAKE IT
AT THE MALL, SO...

10:17.337 --> 10:19.499
CAN WE JUST
SKIP THE DEPOSIT?

10:19.499 --> 10:20.941
I'M VERY RESPONSIBLE.

10:20.941 --> 10:23.183
IT'S TRUE. SHE'S NEVER
BEEN DRUNK OR PREGNANT.

10:23.183 --> 10:25.345
LOOK, CAN I JUST
GIVE YOU CASH?

10:25.345 --> 10:27.948
OH. I DON'T
THINK THE ATM

10:27.948 --> 10:29.349
WILL GIVE ME
THAT MUCH.

10:29.349 --> 10:31.111
REALLY?

10:31.111 --> 10:33.634
WOW, I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY
GONE INSIDE A BANK BEFORE.

10:33.634 --> 10:36.957
YES. IT WILL BE
AN ADVENTURE.

10:36.957 --> 10:38.038
THANK YOU.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.881
ANYONE KNOW
WHERE A BANK IS?

10:40.881 --> 10:43.363
THAT IS A VERY LONG
TO‐DO LIST.

10:43.363 --> 10:46.126
CABLE, PHONE, INTERNET,
ELECTRICITY...

10:46.126 --> 10:47.528
‐ WHAT ABOUT GAS?
‐ WHAT ABOUT IT?

10:47.528 --> 10:49.089
<i>IS YOUR WATER HEATER</i>
<i>ELECTRIC OR GAS?</i>

10:49.089 --> 10:51.131
‐ I HAVE NO IDEA.
‐ IT'S PROBABLY GAS.

10:51.131 --> 10:52.092
CALLING THE GAS COMPANY.

10:52.092 --> 10:53.774
THIS IS
A LOT OF WORK.

10:53.774 --> 10:55.576
BUT IT'S WORTH IT.
THE APARTMENT IS AWESOME.

10:55.576 --> 10:56.937
I MEAN, IT NEEDED
A LITTLE <i>JEUJE.</i>

10:56.937 --> 10:58.579
A PAINT JOB, NEW SINK,

10:58.579 --> 11:00.100
I'M PULLING UP
THE CARPETS.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.942
PEOPLE WHO COVER UP
THEIR HARDWOOD FLOORS

11:01.942 --> 11:05.025
DESERVE THEIR OWN
POORLY DECORATED
SECTION OF HELL.

11:05.025 --> 11:06.306
WOW, YOU SEEM
SO GROWN UP.

11:06.306 --> 11:08.188
HEY, DID I LEAVE
MY DANCE BAG IN
YOUR MOM'S CAR?

11:08.188 --> 11:10.951
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW WHO WOULD KNOW?

11:10.951 --> 11:12.953
‐ HOW WOULD SHE KNOW?
‐ SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

11:12.953 --> 11:14.795
I FIGURE SHE CAN USE
HER MELANIE LOJACK SYSTEM

11:14.795 --> 11:16.196
AND TRACK THAT SUCKER
RIGHT DOWN.

11:16.196 --> 11:17.518
OH, HERE.
FOR YOU,

11:17.518 --> 11:19.119
AND YOU, AND YOU.

11:19.119 --> 11:20.801
‐ WHAT'S THIS?
‐ I AM OFFICIALLY
INVITING YOU

11:20.801 --> 11:22.242
TO MY HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

11:22.242 --> 11:24.044
SORRY IT'S SO LAST MINUTE,
BUT I THOUGHT HEAT AND LIGHT

11:24.044 --> 11:25.165
WOULD MAKE IT
MORE FESTIVE.

11:25.165 --> 11:26.366
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I BRING CARL?

11:26.366 --> 11:28.048
NO. NO ONE
BRINGS ANYONE.

11:28.048 --> 11:29.449
IT'S JUST
THE FOUR OF US.

11:29.449 --> 11:32.012
YES, AND ALL THE OTHER
PEOPLE I'M INVITING.

11:32.012 --> 11:33.333
WHO?
WHO ARE YOU INVITING?

11:33.333 --> 11:35.335
WELL, FREAK,
SOME GIRLS FROM CLASS,

11:35.335 --> 11:36.937
MICHELLE, THE THREE PEOPLE
I LIKE AT SCHOOL,

11:36.937 --> 11:39.019
AND MY NEIGHBORS SO
THEY CAN'T COMPLAIN
ABOUT THE NOISE.

11:39.019 --> 11:41.862
( laughing )

11:41.862 --> 11:43.504
ARE YOU INVITING
COZETTE?

11:43.504 --> 11:44.785
WELL,
SHE'S IN OUR CLASS.

11:44.785 --> 11:46.346
‐ IF SHE COMES,
COUNT ME OUT.
‐ SERIOUSLY?

11:46.346 --> 11:47.467
‐ GINNY, COME ON.
‐ WHAT COME ON?

11:47.467 --> 11:48.909
FOUR'S COMPANY.
FIVE'S A CROWD.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.430
FINE. IF GINNY'S NOT GOING,
I'M NOT GOING.

11:50.430 --> 11:51.992
‐ YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
‐ I WANT TO.

11:51.992 --> 11:53.193
IT'S NOT ON
MY ACCOUNT, I HOPE.

11:53.193 --> 11:54.515
OF COURSE IT'S
ON YOUR ACCOUNT.

11:54.515 --> 11:55.796
‐ THEN GO. YES.
‐ NO.

11:55.796 --> 11:57.357
OH MY GOD.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.282
WE HAVEN'T BEEN
PROPERLY INTRODUCED.
I'M SASHA.

12:02.282 --> 12:03.443
I WAS PLANNING ON
INVITING YOU

12:03.443 --> 12:04.805
TO A HOUSEWARMING
PARTY I'M HAVING

12:04.805 --> 12:06.006
SO WE CAN GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

12:06.006 --> 12:07.367
BUT MY FRIENDS OVER THERE
ARE RE‐ENACTING

12:07.367 --> 12:08.729
THE LAST THIRD
OF "BENJAMIN BUTTON"

12:08.729 --> 12:09.970
AND WILL SOON
TURN FOUR.

12:09.970 --> 12:11.371
SO WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF WE JUST GRABBED

12:11.371 --> 12:12.933
A COFFEE
SOMETIME INSTEAD?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.935
‐ COOL BEANS.
‐ I'M INTERPRETING
THAT AS A YES.

12:14.935 --> 12:15.936
SO, THANK YOU.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.941
NO COZETTE. OKAY?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.943
KIM, KHLOE?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.785
TRUCE FOR THE EVENING?

12:24.785 --> 12:25.786
GOOD.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.351
SO, DO I GET
TO BRING CARL?

12:32.793 --> 12:34.515
IT'S AN ANNUAL
EVENT IN THE DESERT

12:34.515 --> 12:36.797
THAT IS A CELEBRATION
OF SELF‐EXPRESSION.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.358
YEAH, BUT WHAT DOES IT
SAY ABOUT BATHROOMS?

12:38.358 --> 12:40.961
OH, LOOK AT THESE PICTURES.
MY GOD, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.683
YEAH YEAH YEAH.
IS THERE A PICTURE
OF THE BATHROOMS?

12:42.683 --> 12:44.685
"AN EXPERIMENT IN
COMMUNAL LIVING."

12:44.685 --> 12:47.207
I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE.
YOU WIND UP NEVER HAVING
A CLEAN TOWEL.

12:47.207 --> 12:48.809
OOH, WHAT'S THAT
OVER THERE?

12:48.809 --> 12:50.811
‐ A ROCK.
‐ OH, I THOUGHT IT
WAS A BATHROOM.

12:50.811 --> 12:53.814
ARE YOU PLANNING ON EATING
A GREAT DEAL OF ROADSIDE FOOD

12:53.814 --> 12:55.936
AND HAVING SOME TERRIBLE
REACTION ONCE YOU GET THERE?

12:55.936 --> 12:57.497
I JUST HAVE A THING
ABOUT BATHROOMS, OKAY?

12:57.497 --> 12:59.940
I WANT ONE WITHIN
A GOOD 10‐MILE RADIUS.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.342
YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
YOU NEED TO BE OPEN
TO NEW THINGS.

13:02.342 --> 13:03.944
THAT'S HOW I FELT
ABOUT WOODSTOCK.

13:03.944 --> 13:05.345
YOU WENT TO WOODSTOCK?

13:05.345 --> 13:06.947
I DIDN'T WANT TO
AT FIRST.

13:06.947 --> 13:08.589
BUT IT TURNED OUT
TO BE ONE OF THE BEST

13:08.589 --> 13:09.950
EXPERIENCES
OF MY LIFE.

13:09.950 --> 13:12.352
BECAUSE I GAVE MYSELF
OVER TO IT.

13:12.352 --> 13:15.956
ALL I REMEMBER IS THIS
WARM GOOEY HAZE OF A WEEKEND

13:15.956 --> 13:17.958
FILLED WITH LOVE
AND CONNECTION.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.600
AND AT THE END OF IT,

13:19.600 --> 13:21.201
I WOUND UP
WITH A BABY.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.963
HUBBELL WAS CONCEIVED
AT WOODSTOCK?

13:22.963 --> 13:25.806
NO, LITERALLY.
I OPENED MY BAG
AS I WAS LEAVING

13:25.806 --> 13:27.367
AND SOMEBODY HAD SLIPPED
A BABY INSIDE.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.809
OH MY GOD.
WHAT'D YOU DO?

13:28.809 --> 13:30.811
I JUST LEFT IT
AT THE LOST BABY TABLE

13:30.811 --> 13:32.372
IN THE PARKING LOT.
A LOT OF BABIES WERE PUT

13:32.372 --> 13:33.814
IN THE WRONG
PURSE THAT DAY.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.375
WOODSTOCK, HUH?

13:35.375 --> 13:36.937
‐ MM.
‐ WHAT'S THE BATHROOM
SITUATION THERE?

13:36.937 --> 13:39.900
‐ ( sighs )
‐ <i>( cellphone rings )</i>

13:39.900 --> 13:41.542
‐ HELLO?
‐ <i>Check your mailbox.</i>

13:41.542 --> 13:43.423
‐ IS IT TICKING?
‐ <i>I put something</i>
<i>in it for you.</i>

13:43.423 --> 13:45.746
‐ SASHA?
‐ <i>Yes, just make sure</i>
<i>you go and check</i>

13:45.746 --> 13:47.387
<i>your mailbox because</i>
<i>sometimes you don't.</i>

13:47.387 --> 13:48.949
WHY DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY MAILBOX?

13:48.949 --> 13:49.950
<i>Because sometimes</i>
<i>we walk by</i>

13:49.950 --> 13:51.351
<i>and all the mail</i>
<i>is spilling out</i>

13:51.351 --> 13:52.513
<i>like you haven't</i>
<i>checked it in forever,</i>

13:52.513 --> 13:53.514
<i>and we wonder</i>
<i>if you're dead,</i>

13:53.514 --> 13:54.515
<i>but no one wants to look.</i>

13:54.515 --> 13:55.876
HEY, WHAT IF
I NEED HELP?

13:55.876 --> 13:58.038
<i>If you're dead,</i>
<i>it's too late for help.</i>

13:58.038 --> 14:00.360
GOOD POINT. WAIT A MINUTE,
REHEARSAL'S IN FIVE MINUTES.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.762
‐ <i>So?</i>
‐ AREN'T YOU HERE?

14:04.364 --> 14:05.966
‐ REALLY?
‐ WHAT?

14:05.966 --> 14:07.207
SO YOU HAD TO CALL?
YOU WERE GONNA SEE ME

14:07.207 --> 14:08.769
‐ IN THREE SECONDS.
‐ I WANTED TO INVITE YOU

14:08.769 --> 14:10.090
TO MY HOUSEWARMING
PARTY.

14:10.090 --> 14:11.411
BUT YOU ALREADY SENT ME
AN INVITATION.

14:11.411 --> 14:13.053
YES, BUT YOU NEVER
CHECK YOUR MAIL,

14:13.053 --> 14:14.254
SO WHO KNOWS
IF YOU'D FIND IT.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.537
YOU'RE CALLING TO TELL ME
TO CHECK MY MAIL

14:16.537 --> 14:18.378
TO FIND IT,
SO CHANCES ARE
I'LL FIND IT.

14:18.378 --> 14:20.861
REMEMBER WHEN WE HID
THAT BUNCH OF ROTTING
BANANAS IN YOUR DANCE BAG?

14:20.861 --> 14:22.302
YOU DID?
THAT'S THE SMELL?

14:22.302 --> 14:23.744
CHECK YOUR BOX.

14:26.186 --> 14:27.748
I FOUND PICTURES.

14:27.748 --> 14:29.029
GAH, MUST UNSEE.

14:29.029 --> 14:30.230
"ETERNAL SUNSHINE"
MY MIND.

14:30.230 --> 14:32.112
YOU LIVED IN VEGAS.
HOW CAN THIS BE SHOCKING?

14:32.112 --> 14:33.754
OKAY, IF THAT
HAPPENED IN VEGAS,

14:33.754 --> 14:35.756
EVEN VEGAS WOULD BE SAYING,
"TELL SOMEONE ABOUT THIS.

14:35.756 --> 14:37.117
DON'T LET IT
STAY IN VEGAS."

14:37.117 --> 14:38.238
HEY, PARTNERS.

14:38.238 --> 14:39.920
Fanny: <i>MILLY, WHAT</i>
<i>A NICE SURPRISE.</i>

14:39.920 --> 14:41.121
I JUST CAME BY
TO DROP OFF

14:41.121 --> 14:42.362
A COUPLE MORE CHECKS.

14:42.362 --> 14:44.765
WHO KNEW USHER UNIFORMS
COULD BE SO EXPENSIVE?

14:44.765 --> 14:46.366
‐ REALLY?
‐ WHAT, ARE THEY MADE
OF VICUNA OR SOMETHING?

14:46.366 --> 14:47.768
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE MADE OF,

14:47.768 --> 14:48.769
BUT AT THOSE PRICES,
I'M GONNA START

14:48.769 --> 14:49.930
SELLING THEM MYSELF.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.532
JUST KNOW HOW GRATEFUL
WE ARE TO YOU

14:51.532 --> 14:53.053
FOR YOUR PATRONAGE.

14:53.053 --> 14:54.975
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
FINISH WARMING UP.

14:54.975 --> 14:56.617
REHEARSAL
IN FIVE MINUTES.

14:56.617 --> 14:58.018
UM, FANNY,
I WAS WONDERING

14:58.018 --> 15:00.541
‐ IF THIS MIGHT
BE A GOOD TIME.
‐ FOR WHAT?

15:00.541 --> 15:01.822
WELL, FOR MY
BACKER'S REHEARSAL.

15:03.824 --> 15:05.506
‐ YOUR WHAT?
‐ MY BACKER'S REHEARSAL.

15:05.506 --> 15:07.908
IT'S A SPECIAL
ADVANCE PERFORMANCE
FOR INVESTORS.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.269
YEAH, WE KNOW WHAT
A BACKER'S REHEARSAL IS.

15:09.269 --> 15:10.751
‐ SO YOU READ "PLAYBILL"?
‐ WHAT?

15:10.751 --> 15:12.152
"PLAYBILL."
I STARTED READING IT

15:12.152 --> 15:13.954
THE MINUTE I BECAME
A PLAYER IN THE BIZ,
SO TO SPEAK,

15:13.954 --> 15:15.596
AND NOW I'M
TOTALLY ADDICTED.

15:15.596 --> 15:17.758
DID YOU KNOW
THE LEAD IN "MEMPHIS"
JUST BOOKED A SITCOM?

15:17.758 --> 15:19.319
‐ WE DID NOT KNOW THAT.
‐ IT'S TRUE.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.121
SO IS NOW A GOOD TIME?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.163
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE
ABOUT READY TO REHEARSE
NOW ANYHOW, SO...

15:23.163 --> 15:24.965
MILLY, THIS WOULD
ABSOLUTELY NOT‐‐

15:24.965 --> 15:26.366
FANNY, CAN I‐‐

15:26.366 --> 15:27.367
OVER HERE
FOR A SEC.

15:29.449 --> 15:31.051
IS SHE OUT
OF HER MIND?

15:31.051 --> 15:32.973
ISN'T IT ENOUGH I LET HER PUT
HER NAME ON THE AMPHITHEATER?

15:32.973 --> 15:34.975
EXCUSE ME,
ON THE PERFORMANCE CENTER?

15:34.975 --> 15:36.537
PRETEND TO BE LOOKING
AT OUR SCHEDULE.

15:36.537 --> 15:38.539
A PERFORMANCE CENTER
ISN'T A THEATER.

15:38.539 --> 15:39.980
IT'S WHERE MICHAEL PHELPS
GOES TO TRAIN.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.582
‐ I KNOW.
‐ IT'S WHERE THEY TEST

15:41.582 --> 15:43.824
‐ EXPENSIVE GERMAN
SPORTS CARS.
‐ DON'T DISAGREE.

15:43.824 --> 15:46.667
IT'S WHERE MEN WITH
DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT
HAVE PUMPS INSTALLED

15:46.667 --> 15:49.109
SO THAT THEY CAN
LEAVE THEIR WIVES
FOR A YOGA TEACHER.

15:49.109 --> 15:51.111
OKAY, COME BACK
TO ME HERE.

15:51.111 --> 15:52.593
THIS IS AN INVASION.

15:52.593 --> 15:54.034
SHE CAN SEE THE SHOW
WHEN IT'S READY.

15:54.034 --> 15:56.356
‐ JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
‐ OKAY, DEVIL'S ADVOCATE.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.198
IF IT WEREN'T FOR MILLY,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE A THEATER,

15:58.198 --> 15:59.680
OR LIGHTS,
OR COSTUMES.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.762
<i>AND LET'S NOT FORGET</i>
<i>THE WELL‐BUILT USHERS.</i>

16:03.123 --> 16:04.124
THAT'S DEFINITELY A PERK.

16:04.124 --> 16:05.285
SHE JUST WANTS
TO SEE A REHEARSAL

16:05.285 --> 16:06.967
AND WE'RE ALREADY
DOING A REHEARSAL.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.769
LETTING HER WATCH
A LITTLE PRETTY DANCING

16:08.769 --> 16:10.370
SEEMS LIKE
A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

16:13.774 --> 16:15.135
WELL...

16:15.135 --> 16:17.137
WE HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS.

16:17.137 --> 16:18.498
WE CHECKED OUR SCHEDULE,

16:18.498 --> 16:20.781
AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE CAN DO
YOUR BACKER'S REHEARSAL

16:20.781 --> 16:22.262
‐ RIGHT NOW.
‐ REALLY?

16:22.262 --> 16:23.704
‐ REALLY.
‐ GREAT.

16:23.704 --> 16:26.106
‐ THERE'S JUST ONE
SMALL PROBLEM.
‐ WHAT?

16:26.106 --> 16:27.748
WELL, BACKER'S REHEARSALS

16:27.748 --> 16:29.910
USUALLY HAVE BEAUTIFUL
SPREADS OF FOOD.

16:29.910 --> 16:31.752
SUSHI PLATTERS,
CHAMPAGNE,

16:31.752 --> 16:33.594
ONE TIME I SAW
A CREPE GUY.

16:33.594 --> 16:36.597
IT'S JUST A SHAME THAT
THIS IS ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

16:36.597 --> 16:39.359
‐ WE COULDN'T ARRANGE THAT.
‐ LET ME MAKE A CALL.

16:42.362 --> 16:44.164
AT LEAST WE'RE GONNA EAT.

16:51.692 --> 16:53.213
HEY.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.695
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

16:54.695 --> 16:55.696
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'D BELIEVE

16:55.696 --> 16:57.137
I'M SIGNING UP
FOR CLASS?

16:57.137 --> 16:58.378
CHANNELING MY INNER
BARYSHNIKOV?

16:58.378 --> 16:59.580
NO.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.061
THEN I GUESS
I WAS HOPING

17:01.061 --> 17:02.062
I'D RUN INTO YOU.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.824
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AROUND LATELY.

17:03.824 --> 17:04.945
OH, YEAH.

17:04.945 --> 17:06.507
‐ THINGS HAVE BEEN CRAZY.
‐ I FIGURED.

17:06.507 --> 17:09.149
I MEAN, NONE OF YOUR
TEXTS ARE MORE THAN
THREE LETTERS LONG.

17:09.149 --> 17:11.191
‐ SORRY.
‐ I CAN'T EVEN FIGURE OUT
HALF OF THEM.

17:11.191 --> 17:12.673
WHAT DOES "CTN" MEAN?

17:12.673 --> 17:14.875
‐ CAN'T TEXT NOW.
‐ OH, OF COURSE.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.637
OR CAN'T TALK NOW
DEPENDING ON CONTEXT.

17:16.637 --> 17:18.198
I THINK
YOU'VE SENT BOTH.

17:18.198 --> 17:20.921
I'M REALLY SORRY.
I'VE JUST BEEN CRAZY
WITH STUFF, YOU KNOW?

17:20.921 --> 17:23.123
WELL, ARE YOU
BUSY TONIGHT?

17:23.123 --> 17:24.124
‐ I WAS THINKING‐‐
‐ I CAN'T TONIGHT.

17:24.124 --> 17:25.365
‐ I'M‐‐
‐ YEAH.

17:25.365 --> 17:27.688
‐ OKAY.
‐ BUT WE'LL DO
SOMETHING SOON.

17:27.688 --> 17:29.049
I PROMISE.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.971
I'LL TEXT YOU.
FOUR LETTERS THIS TIME.

17:35.375 --> 17:36.937
SO MILLY,
WE'LL BE GETTING STARTED

17:36.937 --> 17:38.138
IN JUST A SECOND.

17:38.138 --> 17:39.940
‐ IT'S VERY EXCITING.
‐ OH, I KNOW.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.702
‐ FOR EVERYONE.
‐ AND YOU'LL BE
HAPPY TO KNOW

17:41.702 --> 17:42.943
I UNWRAPPED
MY HARD CANDY,

17:42.943 --> 17:44.384
SO THE NOISE WON'T
BE DISTRACTING

17:44.384 --> 17:45.465
DURING THE PERFORMANCE.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.947
I'M THRILLED.

17:46.947 --> 17:50.751
OKAY, CLASS.
WE HAVE A SPECIAL GUEST
FOR REHEARSAL TODAY.

17:50.751 --> 17:53.914
OUR BENEVOLENT BENEFACTOR,
OUR ANGEL,

17:53.914 --> 17:55.996
MILLICENT STONE.

17:55.996 --> 17:58.118
( applause )

18:00.200 --> 18:03.363
PLEASE, CALL ME MILLY
AND PRETEND I'M NOT HERE.

18:03.363 --> 18:05.365
PLACES, EVERYONE.

18:05.365 --> 18:08.769
WE'LL JUST RUN THE OPENING,
RAY‐RAY'S SOLO,

18:08.769 --> 18:09.930
AND THEN THE ENDING.

18:09.930 --> 18:11.692
THOSE NEED THE MOST
WORK ANYHOW.

18:11.692 --> 18:13.213
‐ SOUNDS‐‐
‐ <i>( screeching, scraping )</i>

18:17.818 --> 18:19.379
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

18:19.379 --> 18:21.622
A VERY POORLY STAGED
VERSION OF "MEIN HERR"?

18:24.384 --> 18:26.386
( scraping continues )

18:46.607 --> 18:49.530
AND MUSIC, PLEASE.

18:49.530 --> 18:51.532
<i>( "Sleeping Beauty Waltz"</i>
<i>playing )</i>

19:23.884 --> 19:25.365
SHE'S NOT‐‐

19:25.365 --> 19:26.967
NO...

19:29.970 --> 19:31.051
SHE'S TAKING NOTES.

19:47.067 --> 19:49.269
‐ I'M GONNA‐‐
‐ NO, YOU'RE NOT.

19:50.831 --> 19:53.393
‐ ( inhales )
‐ IT'S OKAY.

20:15.856 --> 20:17.938
( breathes deeply )

20:58.779 --> 21:00.781
( applause )

21:00.781 --> 21:02.863
WONDERFUL WORK,
EVERYONE.

21:02.863 --> 21:04.585
VERY VERY NICE.

21:04.585 --> 21:07.107
NOW REMEMBER,
WE TECH NEXT WEDNESDAY

21:07.107 --> 21:09.029
AND DRESS ON THURSDAY.

21:09.029 --> 21:10.791
I'LL SEE YOU ALL THEN.

21:10.791 --> 21:13.714
DANCERS TO THE CHAIR, PLEASE.

21:13.714 --> 21:14.795
WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

21:14.795 --> 21:16.917
LET'S GO.
TIME IS MONEY.

21:16.917 --> 21:19.279
<i>( cellphone rings )</i>

21:19.279 --> 21:21.361
YES?

21:21.361 --> 21:23.564
CAN'T NOW.
HAVE A NOTE SESSION.

21:23.564 --> 21:26.326
<i>OKAY, SO A LOT</i>
<i>OF GOOD STUFF HERE.</i>

21:26.326 --> 21:28.088
JUST A FEW THINGS.

21:28.088 --> 21:31.371
FIRST OFF, IT'S VERY CONFUSING
THAT YOU'RE NOT WEARING TUTUS.

21:31.371 --> 21:33.293
PEOPLE EXPECT TUTUS
WHEN YOU GO TO THE BALLET.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.935
‐ MILLY!
‐ BACK IT UP, BACK IT UP.

21:34.935 --> 21:37.938
MILLY, IT WASN'T
A DRESS REHEARSAL.

21:40.180 --> 21:42.022
THEY WEREN'T IN COSTUME

21:42.022 --> 21:44.344
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT
A DRESS REHEARSAL.

21:46.787 --> 21:48.148
SO THEY WEREN'T DRESSED.

21:50.791 --> 21:52.953
I PROMISE THERE WILL BE
TUTUS FOR THE SHOW.

21:52.953 --> 21:54.955
OH. OH, GOOD.
SO WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.

21:54.955 --> 21:57.477
GREAT. SO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELPFUL THOUGHTS‐‐

21:57.477 --> 21:58.559
HOLD ON.

21:58.559 --> 22:00.841
THERE'S TOO MUCH
OF THIS STEP...

22:03.363 --> 22:04.765
YOU GET THE GIST.
SO LESS OF THAT

22:04.765 --> 22:05.846
FOR THE WHOLE GROUP.

22:05.846 --> 22:08.529
AND DON'T DO
THE SPINNY THING.

22:08.529 --> 22:10.370
IT MAKES ME DIZZY.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.773
AND YOU, YOU DID
THIS ONE MOVE

22:12.773 --> 22:14.775
WHERE IT LOOKED
LIKE YOU WERE TRIPPING.

22:14.775 --> 22:16.056
THAT WAS WHEN
I TRIPPED.

22:16.056 --> 22:17.417
GOOD CATCH, MILLY.

22:17.417 --> 22:19.940
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THE TRIPPING SHOULD CHANGE.

22:19.940 --> 22:21.942
‐ RIGHT, FANNY?
‐ SURE.

22:21.942 --> 22:24.745
AND HERE'S A QUESTION.
WHERE ARE THE DWARVES?

22:24.745 --> 22:26.066
DWARVES?

22:26.066 --> 22:27.628
WE'RE DOING "SLEEPING BEAUTY."
THERE ARE SUPPOSED

22:27.628 --> 22:30.390
‐ TO BE DWARVES.
‐ IN "SNOW WHITE."

22:30.390 --> 22:32.953
THE DWARVES ARE
IN "SNOW WHITE."

22:32.953 --> 22:36.156
WE ARE NOT DOING
"SLEEPING BEAUTY AND
THE SEVEN DWARVES."

22:36.156 --> 22:37.958
OH, I ALWAYS GET
THOSE MIXED UP.

22:37.958 --> 22:40.521
OKAY, NEXT.

22:40.521 --> 22:41.922
WHAT'S WITH
ALL THE MIRRORS?

22:41.922 --> 22:43.604
WHO NEEDS TO LOOK
AT THEMSELVES THAT MUCH?

22:43.604 --> 22:45.405
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S IT. WE'RE DONE.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.927
WAIT, I HAVE
MORE PAGES.

22:46.927 --> 22:48.248
YOU WANTED
TO SEE A REHEARSAL,

22:48.248 --> 22:49.530
YOU SAW IT,
WE'RE DONE.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.931
LOOK, FANNY,

22:50.931 --> 22:52.973
"PLAYBILL" SAYS A PRODUCER
GETS TO GIVE NOTES.

22:52.973 --> 22:54.975
YOU ARE NOT A PRODUCER.

22:54.975 --> 22:56.376
I GAVE MONEY.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.378
A PRODUCER IS SOMEONE
WHO GIVES MONEY.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.380
AND A PRODUCER GETS
TO HAVE AN OPINION

23:00.380 --> 23:01.782
AND GIVE NOTES,

23:01.782 --> 23:03.944
AND THEY USUALLY HAVE
A CHAIR WITH THEIR NAME ON IT

23:03.944 --> 23:06.186
WHICH I HAVE ORDERED,
AND IT SHOULD BE HERE
BY WEDNESDAY.

23:06.186 --> 23:08.789
AND THAT IS WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THE ARTS TODAY.

23:08.789 --> 23:10.791
PEOPLE WITH
NO KNOWLEDGE AT ALL

23:10.791 --> 23:13.634
THROW A WAD OF CASH ON THE TABLE
LIKE A DRUG DEALER

23:13.634 --> 23:15.195
AND THEN EVERYBODY LISTENS.

23:15.195 --> 23:16.957
WELL, NOT ME
AND NOT HERE.

23:16.957 --> 23:18.639
YOU ARE NOT SCOTT RUDIN

23:18.639 --> 23:20.801
AND THIS IS NOT
A JOHNNY DEPP MOVIE.

23:20.801 --> 23:22.923
THIS IS MY STUDIO
AND MY PRODUCTION

23:22.923 --> 23:26.326
AND YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO RIGHT TO GIVE NOTES.

23:26.326 --> 23:27.768
AND IF THAT'S A PROBLEM,

23:27.768 --> 23:29.770
YOU CAN JUST WRITE
A LETTER TO "PLAYBILL"

23:29.770 --> 23:32.052
AND WORK IT OUT
WITH THEM.

23:32.052 --> 23:34.094
WHY ARE YOU ALL
LISTENING TO HER?

23:34.094 --> 23:35.936
YOU SAID SHE WAS
OUR ANGEL.

23:35.936 --> 23:39.019
EVERYBODY OUT.

23:39.019 --> 23:40.060
EVERYBODY!

23:40.060 --> 23:42.462
IF YOU WON'T LET ME
HAVE MY INPUT,

23:42.462 --> 23:43.744
THEN I WANT
MY MONEY BACK.

23:43.744 --> 23:45.626
YOU KNOW THAT MONEY'S
ALREADY SPENT.

23:45.626 --> 23:47.027
I'LL SUE.

23:47.027 --> 23:49.630
THEN YOU'LL JUST BE KNOWN
AS THAT MEAN LITTLE WOMAN

23:49.630 --> 23:51.351
THAT SUED
THE TOWN BALLET SCHOOL

23:51.351 --> 23:53.554
AND CRUSHED ALL
THE CHILDREN'S DREAMS.

23:53.554 --> 23:54.955
I DON'T CARE.
YOU CAN TALK TO

23:54.955 --> 23:56.957
THAT WOMEN'S CENTER ON HOWELL
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.

23:56.957 --> 23:58.118
THEY'RE A DRY‐CLEANERS NOW.

23:58.118 --> 24:00.200
FINE!
SUE!

24:00.200 --> 24:02.042
CALLING LAWYERS NOW.

24:02.042 --> 24:03.123
CALL LAWYERS.

24:03.123 --> 24:04.805
Phone: <i>Call lawyers.</i>

24:08.769 --> 24:10.771
UH, SO,
THAT WAS KIND OF‐‐

24:10.771 --> 24:11.932
I KNOW.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.059
I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE'RE BRINGING ALL THIS.

24:19.059 --> 24:20.661
IT'S A PARTY.
IT'S WHAT PEOPLE DO.

24:20.661 --> 24:21.982
BUT THE POINT OF
CHIPS AT A PARTY

24:21.982 --> 24:23.303
IS TO SOAK UP BOOZE.

24:23.303 --> 24:25.145
THIS PARTY'S BEING THROWN
BY A 16‐YEAR‐OLD.

24:25.145 --> 24:26.747
THAT'S JUST IT.
SASHA'S A KID.

24:26.747 --> 24:28.388
SHE WON'T HAVE
GOTTEN ENOUGH FOOD

24:28.388 --> 24:30.310
AND THE PARTY WILL SUCK
AND EVERYONE WILL CALL
HER MARY RICHARDS.

24:30.310 --> 24:31.912
YES, GRANDMA.
I'M SURE ALL THE KIDS

24:31.912 --> 24:33.914
WILL BE CALLING HER
MARY RICHARDS.

24:33.914 --> 24:36.476
‐ OH, HEY.
‐ HEY, JUST GETTING BREAD
FOR THE BRUSCHETTA.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.478
‐ <i>( music playing )</i>
‐ ( kids chattering )

24:40.921 --> 24:42.603
THIS IS A 16‐YEAR‐OLD'S
APARTMENT?

24:42.603 --> 24:44.324
Michelle: <i>OR OZ.</i>
<i>IT COULD BE OZ.</i>

24:44.324 --> 24:45.966
‐ SHE'S GOT A FIREPLACE.
‐ AND WOOD.

24:45.966 --> 24:47.287
THERE'S WOOD BURNING
IN THE FIREPLACE.

24:47.287 --> 24:48.889
I HAD A FIREPLACE
WHEN I LIVED IN OREGON.

24:48.889 --> 24:49.970
THE RATS
NESTED IN IT.

24:49.970 --> 24:51.732
( gasps )
CHECK OUT THE FOOD TABLE.

24:51.732 --> 24:53.053
OH, SHE'S GOT
THOSE METAL CONTAINERS

24:53.053 --> 24:54.735
WITH THE CANDLE THINGIES
UNDER THEM.

24:54.735 --> 24:56.216
CHAFING DISHES,
SHE'S GOT CHAFING DISHES.

24:56.216 --> 24:57.738
‐ EXCUSE ME?
‐ YES?

24:57.738 --> 24:59.499
COULD YOU PLEASE
GET ME A PILLOW?

24:59.499 --> 25:00.500
SURE.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.742
BUT DON'T TAKE
A NICE ONE.

25:01.742 --> 25:03.303
THEN I'LL HAVE TO RUN
BACK TO MY PLACE.

25:03.303 --> 25:04.505
( gasps )
LET'S CHECK OUT
THE BATHROOM.

25:04.505 --> 25:05.586
DOES SHE LET
PEOPLE GO IN THERE?

25:05.586 --> 25:06.907
I'M GOING IN.

25:06.907 --> 25:09.069
OKAY, NOW DO I
ADD THE NUTS?

25:09.069 --> 25:10.511
MARTHA SAYS
WHEN THE EGG WHITE

25:10.511 --> 25:12.312
HAS BEEN PROPERLY BEATEN,
NO CLEAR LIQUID

25:12.312 --> 25:13.914
SHOULD REMAIN
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL.

25:13.914 --> 25:15.155
I SEE NO
CLEAR LIQUID.

25:15.155 --> 25:16.917
‐ THEN FOLLOW MARTHA.
‐ ADDING THE NUTS.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.318
PIPES LOOK GOOD.

25:18.318 --> 25:19.760
THAT ADDS A LOT
OF RESALE VALUE.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.921
TAKE YOUR BROKER'S
VEST OFF, GINNY.

25:20.921 --> 25:22.523
OH, SHOOT.
I FORGOT THE ICE RING

25:22.523 --> 25:23.924
‐ FOR THE PUNCH.
‐ OOH, I'LL GET IT.

25:28.008 --> 25:29.650
IT'S SO PRETTY.

25:29.650 --> 25:31.612
THE PANSIES
ARE EDIBLE.

25:31.612 --> 25:33.894
MONOGRAMMED TOWELS.
SHE HAS MONOGRAMMED TOWELS.

25:33.894 --> 25:35.295
‐ I SAW.
‐ DON'T YOU NEED, LIKE,

25:35.295 --> 25:36.897
SIX WEEKS TO GET
SOMETHING MONOGRAMMED?

25:36.897 --> 25:38.899
NO IDEA.
I WRITE MY NAME
ON MY UNDERPANTS

25:38.899 --> 25:40.060
WITH A SHARPIE.

25:42.743 --> 25:44.665
HEY, ISN'T THAT YOUR
CHEERLEADING FRIEND?

25:44.665 --> 25:46.747
Sasha: <i>AUBREY.</i>
<i>I DIDN'T EVEN INVITE HER.</i>

25:46.747 --> 25:48.308
CHEERLEADERS
CAN SENSE PARTIES.

25:48.308 --> 25:49.910
IT'S INNATE.
IT'S LIKE THEIR ABILITY

25:49.910 --> 25:50.991
TO MAKE PEOPLE
FEEL SMALL.

25:50.991 --> 25:52.753
SASHA!

25:52.753 --> 25:54.074
I HOPE IT'S OKAY
THAT I CAME

25:54.074 --> 25:55.596
'CAUSE WHEN I HEARD
MY FRIEND SASHA

25:55.596 --> 25:57.317
WAS HAVING A PARTY,
I JUST HAD TO BE HERE.

25:57.317 --> 25:59.319
OF COURSE.
FRIEND.

25:59.319 --> 26:01.001
OH, HEY, BOO,
WILL YOU STIR FOR ME?

26:01.001 --> 26:03.003
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

26:03.003 --> 26:04.084
HI, I'M AUBREY.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.926
I'M GINNY.
WE'VE MET BEFORE.

26:05.926 --> 26:07.007
NO.

26:07.007 --> 26:08.488
‐ SEVERAL TIMES.
‐ I DON'T THINK SO.

26:08.488 --> 26:09.730
WE'RE IN THE SAME
CHEM CLASS.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.732
‐ ARE YOU SURE?
‐ WE'RE LAB PARTNERS.

26:11.732 --> 26:12.893
NOT RINGING
ANY BELLS.

26:12.893 --> 26:14.735
‐ <i>HEY, AUBREY!</i>
‐ MADDIE, HI!

26:14.735 --> 26:15.896
<i>HOW ARE YOU?</i>

26:15.896 --> 26:17.938
IT'S LIKE BREATHING
TO THEM.

26:17.938 --> 26:19.219
YOU MADE IT.

26:19.219 --> 26:20.901
‐ WE MADE IT.
‐ YOU'RE THE 16‐YEAR‐OLD?

26:20.901 --> 26:22.062
WHAT'S WITH
THE HOSTILE TONE?

26:22.062 --> 26:23.223
I'M A LITTLE PISSED
BY ALL THIS.

26:23.223 --> 26:25.906
IGNORE HIM.
BUT STILL, THIS PLACE.

26:25.906 --> 26:27.988
AND THE FURNITURE,
AND YOU HAVE A BUCKET.

26:27.988 --> 26:29.069
‐ OF COURSE.
‐ NOT OF COURSE.

26:29.069 --> 26:30.310
I'VE NEVER
OWNED A BUCKET.

26:30.310 --> 26:31.672
I HAVEN'T EITHER.
YOU BORROW BUCKETS.

26:31.672 --> 26:32.753
‐ YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
‐ IGNORE HIM.

26:32.753 --> 26:33.994
YOU BROUGHT UP
THE BUCKET.

26:33.994 --> 26:35.075
COME ON. I WANT TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

26:38.919 --> 26:40.921
WOW. WHAT A GREAT ROOM.

26:40.921 --> 26:43.323
I LOVE THE DRESSER
AND THE PILLOWS.

26:43.323 --> 26:46.086
AND HOW THE FRESH‐CUT FLOWERS
PICK UP THE PINK IN THE FROG‐‐

26:46.086 --> 26:47.648
YOU'VE ALREADY
BEEN IN HERE,
HAVEN'T YOU?

26:47.648 --> 26:49.610
TOTALLY. WENT THROUGH
YOUR UNDERWEAR DRAWER
AND EVERYTHING.

26:49.610 --> 26:51.051
HEY, CAN YOU SHOW ME
HOW TO DO THAT THING

26:51.051 --> 26:52.893
WHERE YOU FOLD UP YOUR
SOCKS INTO TINY LITTLE BALLS?

26:52.893 --> 26:54.895
THIS IS WHAT
I WANTED YOU TO SEE.

26:54.895 --> 26:57.137
DID YOU STEAL IT
FROM THE STUDIO?

26:57.137 --> 26:58.699
NO. I HAD IT
PUT IN.

26:58.699 --> 26:59.980
AT JOFFREY,
THERE WAS THIS GIRL

26:59.980 --> 27:01.301
WHO TOLD ME HER DAD
PUT A BARRE IN HER ROOM

27:01.301 --> 27:02.663
SO SHE COULD
PRACTICE EVERY NIGHT,

27:02.663 --> 27:03.984
AND SHE WAS
REALLY GOOD.

27:03.984 --> 27:06.146
SO I FIGURED
IF I'M GONNA
GET THAT GOOD,

27:06.146 --> 27:07.147
I NEED A BARRE TOO.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.989
VERY NICE.

27:08.989 --> 27:10.991
SEE? SERIOUS.

27:10.991 --> 27:12.312
YOU ARE.

27:12.312 --> 27:14.114
SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING
YOU WOULD DO.

27:16.476 --> 27:19.199
SO, HEY, DO YOU HAVE
YOUR HOME INVASION
ESCAPE PLAN SET YET?

27:19.199 --> 27:21.001
‐ WHAT'S THAT?
‐ AH, IT'S THE FIRST
THING I DO

27:21.001 --> 27:22.482
ANYTIME I MOVE IN
SOMEPLACE NEW.

27:22.482 --> 27:24.084
IT'S A TOTAL
SINGLE GIRL MUST.

27:24.084 --> 27:25.566
<i>SEE? I LOOK AROUND A ROOM</i>

27:25.566 --> 27:26.927
AND I THINK
THE HOME INVADER

27:26.927 --> 27:28.769
IS COMING IN THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR,

27:28.769 --> 27:30.010
SO WHERE DO I GO?

27:30.010 --> 27:32.012
YOU DON'T WANT TO
HIDE IN THE CLOSET

27:32.012 --> 27:33.213
<i>'CAUSE HE WILL</i>
<i>CHECK THE CLOSET</i>

27:33.213 --> 27:35.295
AND THEN YOU'RE TRAPPED,
SO OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE‐‐

27:35.295 --> 27:37.377
SEE YA.
NOW, YOU'RE ON
THE FIRST FLOOR

27:37.377 --> 27:38.819
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN
JUMP OUT THE WINDOW

27:38.819 --> 27:40.380
WHICH IS AWESOME
EXCEPT IT ALSO MEANS

27:40.380 --> 27:42.382
THE HOME INVADER CAN
COME IN THROUGH THE WINDOW.

27:42.382 --> 27:44.064
WHICH MEANS YOU NEED
A SECOND ESCAPE ROUTE.

27:44.064 --> 27:45.826
PLUS, YOU HOPE IT'S NOT
A GROUP OF HOME INVADERS

27:45.826 --> 27:47.548
LIKE IN "TAKEN," SO...

27:49.149 --> 27:50.551
AND NOBODY EVER
ATTACKED ME

27:50.551 --> 27:52.312
AND I WAS SAFE
AND I GOT A KITTEN.

27:52.312 --> 27:53.554
LET'S SEE THAT
BUCKET AGAIN.

27:53.554 --> 27:54.995
I GOT THE BREAD.

27:54.995 --> 27:56.917
EXCUSE ME A SECOND.
DON'T GO THROUGH MY CLOSET.

27:56.917 --> 27:58.919
THAT MUST MEAN THERE'S
SOMETHING GOOD IN THERE.

27:58.919 --> 28:01.321
WELL WELL WELL,
SOMEBODY'S GOT
A MINI‐ME.

28:01.321 --> 28:02.683
STOP.

28:02.683 --> 28:03.844
SHE TOTALLY
LOOKS UP TO YOU.

28:03.844 --> 28:05.566
YEAH, 'CAUSE I'M
EIGHT FEET TALL.

28:05.566 --> 28:06.927
I THINK IT'S CUTE.

28:06.927 --> 28:08.769
AND A LITTLE
DANGEROUS.

28:17.778 --> 28:19.019
( laughs )

28:23.624 --> 28:25.626
SO YOUR VACUUM CLEANER
DOESN'T NEED BAGS?

28:25.626 --> 28:26.907
NO.

28:26.907 --> 28:28.068
AND THERE'S NO
LOSS OF SUCTION?

28:28.068 --> 28:29.630
NONE THAT I'VE NOTICED.

28:29.630 --> 28:31.231
WOW.

28:31.231 --> 28:32.633
HERE, LET ME GET
MORE ICE FOR YOU.

28:35.836 --> 28:38.238
HI, I'M AUBREY.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.240
‐ GINNY.
‐ GOOD FOR YOU.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.002
‐ WHAT?
‐ I WISH I COULD BE
ONE OF THOSE GIRLS

28:42.002 --> 28:43.083
WHO JUST
DOESN'T CARE.

28:46.486 --> 28:47.928
WHEN I GET AN APARTMENT,

28:47.928 --> 28:49.249
I'M GONNA PAINT
ALL THE WALLS BLACK

28:49.249 --> 28:50.851
AND HANG SILVER TINSEL
FROM THE CEILING.

28:50.851 --> 28:52.492
‐ THAT'S TERRIFYING.
‐ NOT AS TERRIFYING

28:52.492 --> 28:53.734
AS YOUR FAINTING COUCH.

28:53.734 --> 28:55.495
MARTHA SAID A FAINTING COUCH
IS THE PERFECT WAY

28:55.495 --> 28:57.738
TO CREATE SEATING
WITHOUT BLOCKING
NATURAL LIGHT.

28:57.738 --> 28:58.819
SHE'S JUST JEALOUS.

28:58.819 --> 29:00.821
WE ALL ARE.
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

29:00.821 --> 29:02.222
WE SHOULD TOTALLY
MAKE IT OUR HANGOUT.

29:02.222 --> 29:04.464
LIKE IN THAT IRISH MOVIE
WHERE MINNIE DRIVER WAS FAT.

29:04.464 --> 29:05.906
AND THEY HAD THAT
CLUBHOUSE IN THE WOODS

29:05.906 --> 29:06.987
WHERE THEY WOULD
ALL GO FOR PARTIES

29:06.987 --> 29:08.308
AND SECRET TRYSTS?

29:08.308 --> 29:10.350
YES, THIS COULD BE OUR
SECRET IRISH TRYSTY PLACE.

29:10.350 --> 29:11.832
DONE. HEY,
STAY OVER TONIGHT.

29:11.832 --> 29:13.033
WE'LL INITIATE
THE CLUBHOUSE.

29:13.033 --> 29:14.474
‐ OH, I CAN'T.
‐ ME EITHER.

29:14.474 --> 29:16.156
‐ PARENTS SHOT
THE IDEA DOWN.
‐ IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

29:16.156 --> 29:17.998
THE WHOLE "NO ADULT
SUPERVISION" THING

29:17.998 --> 29:20.080
‐ IS A NO GO.
‐ YEAH, IT WAS A BIG DEAL.

29:20.080 --> 29:21.481
THERE WAS OATH SWEARING
AND EVERYTHING.

29:21.481 --> 29:23.924
OH. OKAY.

29:23.924 --> 29:25.045
BUT WE CAN HANG OUT
DURING THE DAY.

29:25.045 --> 29:27.047
AND WE'LL WORK OUT
A SYSTEM EVENTUALLY.

29:27.047 --> 29:28.849
‐ SEE YOU TOMORROW?
‐ YES. THANKS FOR COMING.

29:28.849 --> 29:30.651
TAKE LEFTOVERS.

29:35.656 --> 29:37.658
‐ HEY.
‐ YOU GUYS GOING?

29:37.658 --> 29:39.219
WE HAVE A MYSTERIOUS
SOMETHING TO GET TO.

29:39.219 --> 29:40.821
‐ IT WAS A GREAT PARTY.
‐ THANKS.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.222
LET ME GET YOU
A FAVOR.

29:45.626 --> 29:47.067
‐ CHOCOLATE CHIP.
‐ AND THEY'RE WARM.

29:47.067 --> 29:48.549
OH MY GOD.

29:48.549 --> 29:49.830
LISTEN, KID,

29:49.830 --> 29:51.071
ONE MORE
PIECE OF ADVICE.

29:51.071 --> 29:52.833
DON'T BOND WITH
THE OLD LADY NEXT DOOR.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.635
‐ MRS. WEIDEMEYER?
‐ YOU SEE HER DOOR OPEN,

29:54.635 --> 29:55.836
DIVE FOR COVER.
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,

29:55.836 --> 29:57.237
DO NOT TELL HER
YOU HAVE A CAR.

29:57.237 --> 29:58.639
OLD LADIES ARE
GIANT CON ARTISTS.

29:58.639 --> 30:00.080
‐ CON ARTISTS?
‐ THEY START SMALL.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.481
TRIPS TO THE MARKET
AND THE YARN SHOP,

30:01.481 --> 30:02.923
BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT
YOU'RE PICKING UP

30:02.923 --> 30:03.964
THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS
AT 11:00 AT NIGHT

30:03.964 --> 30:05.085
AND DRIVING THEM
TO THE HOSPITAL

30:05.085 --> 30:06.486
WHEN THEIR HIPS BREAK.
AND YOU THINK‐‐

30:06.486 --> 30:08.328
THEY ONLY HAVE TWO HIPS,
HOW MANY CAN THEY BREAK?

30:08.328 --> 30:09.489
18.

30:09.489 --> 30:10.851
'CAUSE THEY BREAK
THE SAME HIPS

30:10.851 --> 30:11.852
OVER AND OVER.

30:11.852 --> 30:12.853
GOT IT.

30:16.016 --> 30:17.017
SWEETIE,

30:17.017 --> 30:18.859
MY THROAT'S
A LITTLE DRY.

30:18.859 --> 30:21.221
COULD YOU GET ME
A LOZENGE?

30:21.221 --> 30:22.823
SURE.

30:25.906 --> 30:28.629
‐ THAT GIRL IS NOT NORMAL.
‐ I'M NOT DISAGREEING.

30:28.629 --> 30:30.070
THERE WASN'T A BONG
IN THE ENTIRE PLACE.

30:30.070 --> 30:31.471
WHEN I WAS HER AGE,
EVERYTHING IN MY ROOM

30:31.471 --> 30:32.913
WAS EITHER A BONG
OR SOMETHING I COULD

30:32.913 --> 30:33.954
MAKE INTO A BONG.

30:33.954 --> 30:35.556
I WAS 25 BEFORE
I OWNED AN APPLIANCE.

30:35.556 --> 30:37.077
IT WAS A USED MICROWAVE
THAT HAD PERMANENT

30:37.077 --> 30:38.238
SOUP STAINS
AND I'M PRETTY SURE

30:38.238 --> 30:39.399
RADIATED MY OVARIES.

30:39.399 --> 30:41.001
‐ WE SHOULD HIT IT.
‐ MMM.

30:41.001 --> 30:42.563
SO REMEMBER,
RULES OF THE ROAD,

30:42.563 --> 30:44.244
‐ NO PUTTING
YOUR SEAT BACK.
‐ COME ON.

30:44.244 --> 30:46.006
‐ YOU'LL FALL ASLEEP.
‐ SO?

30:46.006 --> 30:47.528
SO IT'S NOT FAIR
THAT YOU GET TO
SLEEP AND I DON'T.

30:47.528 --> 30:49.249
AND IF YOU PUT
YOUR SEAT BACK,
YOU WILL GO TO SLEEP.

30:49.249 --> 30:50.250
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.652
I PROMISE
I WON'T FALL ASLEEP

30:51.652 --> 30:54.655
IF YOU PROMISE ME THERE'S
A BATHROOM AT THIS THING.

30:54.655 --> 30:55.856
FINE.
PUT YOUR SEAT BACK.

30:58.659 --> 30:59.860
<i>( doorbell rings )</i>

30:59.860 --> 31:00.861
( sighs )

31:04.785 --> 31:07.227
HELLO, MILLY.
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

31:07.227 --> 31:08.789
THANK YOU FOR
THE INVITATION.

31:08.789 --> 31:10.390
MAY I TAKE
YOUR PURSE?

31:10.390 --> 31:11.712
WHY?

31:11.712 --> 31:13.393
I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D BE
MORE COMFORTABLE WITHOUT IT.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.636
‐ REALLY?
‐ REALLY.

31:15.636 --> 31:17.798
I'LL KEEP IT.
THANK YOU.

31:17.798 --> 31:20.801
MY KITCHEN REMODEL
IS TAKING FOREVER

31:20.801 --> 31:23.003
SO I HAD TO ORDER IN.
I HOPE YOU LIKE BLONDIE'S.

31:23.003 --> 31:24.805
I DO LIKE THEM.
THEY PAY ON TIME

31:24.805 --> 31:26.246
AND DON'T
COMPLAIN TOO MUCH.

31:26.246 --> 31:27.487
YOU RENT TO THEM TOO?

31:27.487 --> 31:29.249
MY CLIENT LIST
IS CONFIDENTIAL.

31:29.249 --> 31:31.251
HAVE A SEAT, MILLY.

31:31.251 --> 31:32.813
WATER?

31:32.813 --> 31:34.815
IT'S THE STAFF
OF LIFE.

31:34.815 --> 31:37.658
OKAY IF WE JUST
SERVE OURSELVES?

31:37.658 --> 31:39.419
IT'S INFORMAL,
I KNOW.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.501
BUT WE'RE NOT SITTING
IN DOWNTON ABBEY, ARE WE?

31:41.501 --> 31:42.503
NO.

31:42.503 --> 31:45.025
NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

31:45.025 --> 31:46.226
( bottle clangs )

31:46.226 --> 31:48.228
I'LL CUT TO THE CHASE
HERE, MILLY.

31:48.228 --> 31:51.231
I OVERREACTED EARLIER.

31:51.231 --> 31:53.233
WHEN YOU TRIED
TO TAKE MY PURSE?

31:53.233 --> 31:55.235
AT THE BACKER'S REHEARSAL.

31:55.235 --> 31:56.396
I AGREE.

31:56.396 --> 31:57.638
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

31:57.638 --> 31:58.919
YOU FORCED ME
TO ACT THAT WAY.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.641
HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

32:00.641 --> 32:02.643
YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

32:02.643 --> 32:04.324
WITH CREATIVE
ENDEAVORS.

32:04.324 --> 32:06.607
CREATING ART
IS NOT DEMOCRATIC.

32:06.607 --> 32:08.368
THESE CARROTS
LOOK GOOD.

32:08.368 --> 32:10.651
MY DANCE STUDIO
IS MY KINGDOM.

32:10.651 --> 32:12.653
AND I AM
THE REIGNING MONARCH,

32:12.653 --> 32:14.454
AND I AM NOT
ACCUSTOMED TO INPUT.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.016
YOU CAN CREATE
ALL YOU WANT.

32:16.016 --> 32:17.818
BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A STAGE TO PUT IT ON,

32:17.818 --> 32:19.259
IT'S USELESS.

32:19.259 --> 32:20.420
WHAT'S ON THIS?

32:20.420 --> 32:22.583
‐ TARRAGON.
‐ YUCK.

32:22.583 --> 32:23.824
LOOK, MILLY,

32:23.824 --> 32:25.225
WE EACH HAVE
A ROLE HERE

32:25.225 --> 32:26.386
AND THEY'RE
BOTH IMPORTANT,

32:26.386 --> 32:28.028
BUT YOU
STEPPED ON MINE.

32:28.028 --> 32:30.230
WHEN YOU'RE THE MONEY PERSON,
YOU GET TO DO THAT.

32:30.230 --> 32:31.792
YOU GET
TO STEP ON PEOPLE?

32:31.792 --> 32:33.233
DIPLOMATICALLY SPEAKING.

32:33.233 --> 32:35.556
THERE'S NO DIPLOMATIC WAY
TO STEP ON PEOPLE.

32:35.556 --> 32:37.397
IS THIS ALL
YOU ORDERED?

32:37.397 --> 32:39.479
YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT,
IS THAT IT, MILLY?

32:39.479 --> 32:41.361
‐ YOU'RE ALWAYS RIGHT.
‐ CLOSE TO ALWAYS.

32:41.361 --> 32:42.563
‐ REALLY?
‐ YES.

32:42.563 --> 32:44.725
WELL, GUESS WHAT
THE STAFF OF LIFE IS, MILLY.

32:44.725 --> 32:46.647
IT'S NOT WATER.
IT'S BREAD.

32:46.647 --> 32:47.728
I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S WATER.

32:47.728 --> 32:49.249
‐ IT'S BREAD.
‐ IT'S BOTH.

32:49.249 --> 32:51.251
THEY'RE BOTH IMPORTANT.
PEOPLE DIE WITHOUT WATER.

32:51.251 --> 32:52.893
WE'RE GETTING OFF
THE SUBJECT HERE.

32:52.893 --> 32:54.254
YOU BROUGHT UP BREAD.

32:54.254 --> 32:55.816
FOR THIS
PARTNERSHIP TO WORK,

32:55.816 --> 32:57.257
YOU NEED TO
MEET ME HALFWAY.

32:57.257 --> 32:58.539
YOU CAN AT LEAST
DO THAT.

32:58.539 --> 32:59.820
NOT IF I DON'T WANT TO.

32:59.820 --> 33:01.782
BY THE WAY,
DO YOU HAVE ANY BREAD?

33:01.782 --> 33:03.263
SEE, THIS IS WHY
NOBODY LIKES YOU.

33:03.263 --> 33:05.425
THIS PIG‐HEADED
STUBBORNNESS OF YOURS.

33:05.425 --> 33:06.747
NO. THE REASON
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ME

33:06.747 --> 33:07.788
IS BECAUSE
I HAVE MONEY.

33:07.788 --> 33:09.790
THAT'S NOT WHY
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU.

33:09.790 --> 33:11.872
IF YOU LOST ALL
YOUR MONEY TOMORROW,

33:11.872 --> 33:13.273
PEOPLE WOULD STILL
DISLIKE YOU.

33:13.273 --> 33:14.875
NO. THEY WOULD DISLIKE ME

33:14.875 --> 33:16.997
BECAUSE WHEN I HAD MONEY
THEY WERE JEALOUS.

33:16.997 --> 33:18.038
NO ONE LIKES
PEOPLE WITH MONEY.

33:18.038 --> 33:19.319
THEY LIKE WARREN BUFFETT.

33:19.319 --> 33:20.641
GIVE ME A BREAK.

33:20.641 --> 33:21.882
THE MAN OWNS
SEE'S CANDY.

33:21.882 --> 33:23.003
EVERYONE LIKES
SEE'S CANDY.

33:23.003 --> 33:24.645
THEY LIKE THE CANDY,
NOT THE MAN.

33:24.645 --> 33:25.886
ONLY HIS FAMILY
LIKES THE MAN

33:25.886 --> 33:28.809
BECAUSE WHEN THE MAN DIES
THEY'LL GET MONEY.

33:28.809 --> 33:31.251
WHAT DO YOU WANT,
MILLY?

33:31.251 --> 33:33.013
WHAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE
HERE?

33:33.013 --> 33:34.655
BOTTOM LINE?

33:34.655 --> 33:37.497
I'M TIRED OF BEING CONSIDERED
JUST A BUSINESSPERSON.

33:37.497 --> 33:39.620
I WANT TO BE CONSIDERED
IMPORTANT IN THE ARTS.

33:39.620 --> 33:41.862
IT'S A BALLET STUDIO
IN A SMALL TOWN.

33:41.862 --> 33:43.023
IT'S A STARTING POINT.

33:43.023 --> 33:44.264
THERE'S A LOT TO KNOW.

33:44.264 --> 33:45.906
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT
GIVING MONEY.

33:45.906 --> 33:47.347
WELL, I WANT TO KNOW
ALL THERE IS.

33:47.347 --> 33:48.348
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

33:48.348 --> 33:49.790
FINE.

33:49.790 --> 33:52.633
THEN I WILL GIVE YOU
BOOKS, DVDS.

33:52.633 --> 33:55.636
I WILL PERSONALLY TEACH YOU
ABOUT DANCE AND BALLET.

33:55.636 --> 33:57.037
AND I'LL HAVE MY PIANIST

33:57.037 --> 33:58.879
TEACH YOU EVERYTHING
YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MUSIC.

33:58.879 --> 34:00.641
WOW.

34:00.641 --> 34:01.802
WHAT?

34:01.802 --> 34:03.884
SOUNDS MONDO
TIME‐CONSUMING.

34:03.884 --> 34:06.647
IT IS MONDO
TIME‐CONSUMING.

34:06.647 --> 34:07.848
MM.

34:07.848 --> 34:09.970
LET ME ASK YOU THIS,
MILLY.

34:09.970 --> 34:11.812
DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW THE ARTS

34:11.812 --> 34:13.333
OR JUST BE PERCEIVED

34:13.333 --> 34:14.975
AS SOMEONE WHO
KNOWS THE ARTS?

34:14.975 --> 34:18.539
WHAT KIND OF TIME COMMITMENT
WOULD THE SECOND ONE BE?

34:18.539 --> 34:20.420
‐ HARDLY ANY.
‐ I'M LISTENING.

34:20.420 --> 34:21.822
LET'S MAKE A DEAL.

34:21.822 --> 34:24.665
I WILL GLADLY TELL
ANYONE YOU WANT

34:24.665 --> 34:26.827
THAT YOU ARE
A MASTER OF THE ARTS.

34:26.827 --> 34:29.109
IN EXCHANGE, YOU WILL LEAVE
THE CREATIVE END

34:29.109 --> 34:30.631
COMPLETELY TO ME.

34:30.631 --> 34:31.712
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

34:31.712 --> 34:33.473
FANNY, I THINK
WE HAVE A DEAL.

34:33.473 --> 34:34.715
GOOD.

34:34.715 --> 34:36.637
WILL YOU TELL PEOPLE
IT WAS MY IDEA

34:36.637 --> 34:38.238
TO WEAR THE TUTUS?

34:38.238 --> 34:40.480
ABSOLUTELY.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.883
IT WAS A LOVELY PARTY.

34:42.883 --> 34:44.805
SO GROWN UP.

34:44.805 --> 34:47.247
HEAVENS, I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH

34:47.247 --> 34:48.809
TO HAVE A CAR.

34:48.809 --> 34:49.890
( chuckles )

34:49.890 --> 34:51.171
DO YOU HAVE A CAR?

34:51.171 --> 34:52.813
NOPE. NO CAR.
JUST FEET.

34:52.813 --> 34:53.814
OH.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.672
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

35:16.236 --> 35:17.958
OH. HEY.

35:17.958 --> 35:19.439
‐ HEY.
‐ WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

35:19.439 --> 35:21.161
I HEARD YOU WERE
HAVING A PARTY.

35:21.161 --> 35:23.003
OH, YEAH.

35:23.003 --> 35:25.445
GUESS MY INVITATION
GOT LOST?

35:26.847 --> 35:28.689
SO CAN I COME IN?

35:28.689 --> 35:29.690
SURE.

35:34.655 --> 35:35.816
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT IT?

35:35.816 --> 35:37.658
AUBREY WAS
CHEERING AT MY GAME.

35:37.658 --> 35:39.820
SHE ASSUMED
I WAS INVITED.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.662
WHEN DID YOU START
PLAYING BASKETBALL
AGAIN?

35:41.662 --> 35:43.263
THREE WEEKS AGO.

35:43.263 --> 35:44.825
‐ OH.
‐ YEP.

35:44.825 --> 35:47.267
IT'S KIND OF BEEN A WHILE
SINCE WE'VE TALKED.

35:47.267 --> 35:50.831
SO WHERE ARE WE
ANYWAY?

35:50.831 --> 35:52.513
MY APARTMENT.

35:52.513 --> 35:54.034
YOUR WHAT?

35:54.034 --> 35:55.796
MY APARTMENT.

35:55.796 --> 35:57.037
IT WAS A HOUSEWARMING PARTY.

35:57.037 --> 35:59.640
YOU GOT AN APARTMENT
AND NEVER TOLD ME.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.802
A WHOLE APARTMENT.
YOU ACTUALLY MOVED?

36:01.802 --> 36:03.964
‐ IT WAS SUDDEN.
‐ SO IF I HAD

36:03.964 --> 36:05.646
SHOWN UP AT YOUR HOUSE
WITH A BOOM BOX

36:05.646 --> 36:07.007
AND PETER GABRIEL
BLASTING...

36:07.007 --> 36:08.689
THE NEW OWNERS WOULD HAVE
CALLED THE POLICE.

36:08.689 --> 36:09.930
RIGHT. OKAY.

36:09.930 --> 36:14.054
SO, CLEARLY THIS ISN'T
GOING TO HAPPEN, RIGHT?

36:14.054 --> 36:16.897
HEY, THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.

36:16.897 --> 36:18.018
OKAY?

36:18.018 --> 36:20.661
I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH A LOT OF STUFF.

36:20.661 --> 36:22.583
MY PARENTS COMPLETELY
ABANDONED ME.

36:22.583 --> 36:23.984
I'M SUDDENLY
ON MY OWN,

36:23.984 --> 36:25.425
AND I HAD TO GET FURNITURE,

36:25.425 --> 36:26.587
AND REDO THE FLOORS,

36:26.587 --> 36:27.748
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE EVER

36:27.748 --> 36:28.909
SET UP UTILITIES,
BUT IF YOU DON'T

36:28.909 --> 36:30.470
HAVE A CREDIT CARD,
IT'S A PROBLEM.

36:30.470 --> 36:32.593
AND EVERY TIME
I THOUGHT ABOUT
MY APARTMENT AND YOU,

36:32.593 --> 36:34.194
AND YOU IN MY APARTMENT
WITH ME,

36:34.194 --> 36:35.836
IT WAS WEIRD
AND CONFUSING.

36:35.836 --> 36:37.117
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT?
IS HE GONNA THINK

36:37.117 --> 36:38.799
I'M INVITING HIM OVER
TO MY BIG PARENT FREE

36:38.799 --> 36:39.880
SEX PALACE NOW?"

36:39.880 --> 36:42.322
<i>AND IT FREAKED ME OUT.</i>

36:42.322 --> 36:43.804
AND I HAD A PARTY TO PLAN
AND LETTUCE TO WASH

36:43.804 --> 36:45.325
SO I HAD TO PUT
YOU OVER THERE

36:45.325 --> 36:46.567
IN A CORNER
BECAUSE I JUST

36:46.567 --> 36:47.928
COULDN'T DEAL
WITH IT YET.

36:47.928 --> 36:49.489
WOW.

36:49.489 --> 36:50.811
YOU'RE WEIRDER
THAN I THOUGHT.

36:50.811 --> 36:52.813
AND I THOUGHT YOU
WERE PRETTY WEIRD.

36:54.054 --> 36:55.656
AND WHY WOULD I
JUST ASSUME

36:55.656 --> 36:56.977
THAT THIS IS
A SEX PALACE, HUH?

36:56.977 --> 36:59.259
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE HELL
A SEX PALACE IS.

36:59.259 --> 37:01.061
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
A BAD THING,

37:01.061 --> 37:02.663
BUT I WOULDN'T
HAVE JUST ASSUMED

37:02.663 --> 37:03.664
THAT THIS IS
ONE OF THEM.

37:03.664 --> 37:04.745
‐ HEY!
‐ WHAT?

37:04.745 --> 37:05.986
SO WHAT?

37:05.986 --> 37:07.427
THIS ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN?

37:07.427 --> 37:09.269
OH MY GOD,
YOU'RE NUTS.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.831
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
CERTIFIABLE.

37:10.831 --> 37:12.272
I HAVE BEEN
CALLING AND TEXTING

37:12.272 --> 37:13.834
AND THROWING
MY SELF‐RESPECT
OUT THE WINDOW

37:13.834 --> 37:15.435
AND BASICALLY
STALKING YOU,

37:15.435 --> 37:17.678
AND YOU JUST TOLD ME
I WAS OUTRANKED BY LETTUCE.

37:17.678 --> 37:19.039
SO YEAH, IT DOESN'T
REALLY SEEM LIKE

37:19.039 --> 37:20.400
YOU WANT THIS
TO HAPPEN.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.722
‐ WELL, I DO.
‐ OH YEAH?

37:21.722 --> 37:22.923
‐ YEAH!
‐ FINE. WHEN?

37:22.923 --> 37:23.964
‐ FRIDAY.
‐ 8:00?

37:23.964 --> 37:24.805
‐ FINE.
‐ GREAT.

37:24.805 --> 37:25.806
‐ BYE!
‐ BYE!

37:33.814 --> 37:35.415
IS THE MAN
ON FIRE YET?

37:35.415 --> 37:36.817
WE'RE NOT THERE.

37:36.817 --> 37:37.978
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

37:37.978 --> 37:39.820
WHERE ARE WE?

37:39.820 --> 37:40.901
TOOK A LITTLE DETOUR.

37:40.901 --> 37:41.982
JUST HAVE TO RUN
A QUICK ERRAND.

37:41.982 --> 37:42.983
I'LL BE BACK
IN A SECOND.

37:55.435 --> 37:56.837
WHAT? I TOLD YOU
TO STAY IN THE CAR.

37:56.837 --> 37:57.918
I THOUGHT I'D
GET SOME FRIES.

37:57.918 --> 37:59.159
I'LL GET YOU FRIES.
GO BACK TO THE CAR.

37:59.159 --> 38:00.400
I MIGHT WANT SOMETHING
WITH MY FRIES.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.962
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH YOUR FRIES?

38:01.962 --> 38:03.564
I DON'T KNOW.
MORE FRIES?

38:03.564 --> 38:05.125
GO BACK TO THE CAR
AND I'LL BRING YOU

38:05.125 --> 38:06.406
SOMETHING YOU'LL LIKE.

38:06.406 --> 38:07.968
IT'LL BE A SURPRISE.
LIKE A GAME.

38:07.968 --> 38:09.970
‐ YOU LIKE GAMES.
‐ YOU'RE BEING WEIRD.

38:09.970 --> 38:11.972
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS THE GUN BEHIND
THE TOILET OR SOMETHING?

38:13.974 --> 38:16.817
YOU'VE GOT TO
BE KIDDING ME.

38:16.817 --> 38:18.418
‐ MICHELLE...
‐ YOU DROVE ALL
THE WAY TO‐‐

38:18.418 --> 38:19.980
‐ WHERE ARE WE?
‐ SACRAMENTO.

38:19.980 --> 38:21.381
SACRAMENTO?
SACRAMENTO?

38:21.381 --> 38:22.983
PLEASE, MICHELLE,
GO BACK TO THE CAR.

38:22.983 --> 38:24.825
TELL ME, SCOTTY,
TELL ME WHY YOU DROVE

38:24.825 --> 38:27.427
200 MILES TO SEE MOM.

38:27.427 --> 38:29.830
A WOMAN I'VE BEEN
ACTIVELY SUCCESSFULLY

38:29.830 --> 38:31.191
AVOIDING
FOR 12 1/2 YEARS?

38:31.191 --> 38:33.153
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
I JUST HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

38:33.153 --> 38:34.434
‐ WHAT?
‐ PLEASE.

38:34.434 --> 38:36.476
GO BACK
TO THE CAR.

38:44.805 --> 38:45.966
MOM.

38:45.966 --> 38:46.967
HANG ON.

38:49.970 --> 38:51.171
( mouthing )

38:53.413 --> 38:55.415
I'M KIND OF IN
A HURRY, MOM.

38:55.415 --> 38:56.977
IF I DON'T FINISH
THIS ARTICLE NOW,

38:56.977 --> 38:57.978
I'LL HAVE TO START
ALL OVER AGAIN.

38:57.978 --> 38:58.979
YOU KNOW THAT.

39:01.862 --> 39:03.984
( sighs )
GOD.

39:03.984 --> 39:06.426
SUSAN SARANDON
IS SO INTERESTING.

39:06.426 --> 39:08.428
SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE POLITICAL.

39:08.428 --> 39:10.230
WOMEN WHO ARE POLITICAL
ARE SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING

39:10.230 --> 39:11.351
THAN WOMEN
WHO ARE NOT.

39:11.351 --> 39:12.993
YOU WANT
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

39:12.993 --> 39:14.434
COFFEE AND FRIES,
PLEASE.

39:14.434 --> 39:15.996
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
‐ ORDERING COFFEE AND FRIES.

39:15.996 --> 39:17.998
‐ WHY?
‐ 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T
SIT IN A DINER

39:17.998 --> 39:19.600
AND NOT ORDER ANYTHING.
IT'S SUPER RUDE.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.921
JUST GO BACK
TO THE CAR.

39:20.921 --> 39:22.242
IGNORE ME.
I'M NOT HERE.

39:22.242 --> 39:23.964
‐ HOW ARE THE CHEESEBURGERS?
‐ COMPARED TO WHAT?

39:23.964 --> 39:25.405
I'LL HAVE
A CHEESEBURGER.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.807
IS THAT MICHELLE?

39:26.807 --> 39:27.928
YES.

39:27.928 --> 39:29.169
WHY DID YOU
BRING MICHELLE?

39:29.169 --> 39:30.811
MOM, PLEASE.
LET'S JUST DO THIS, OKAY?

39:30.811 --> 39:32.132
I'M NOT PREPARED
FOR MICHELLE.

39:32.132 --> 39:33.814
I DIDN'T DRESS
FOR MICHELLE.

39:33.814 --> 39:35.055
GOD. ANYWAY,

39:35.055 --> 39:37.137
DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT THE CONDO?

39:37.137 --> 39:38.418
TALK AND LOOK, MOM.

39:38.418 --> 39:39.860
<i>WELL, IT'S PERFECT FOR ME.</i>

39:39.860 --> 39:41.582
IT HAS TWO BEDROOMS

39:41.582 --> 39:43.744
SO YOU CAN STAY IN ONE
IF YOU EVER VISIT.

39:43.744 --> 39:46.306
AND A BONUS ROOM I'M GOING TO
TURN INTO MY RECORDING STUDIO.

39:46.306 --> 39:47.588
HER RECORDING STUDIO?

39:47.588 --> 39:49.429
I TOLD YOU I WAS GONNA
MAKE AN ALBUM, RIGHT?

39:49.429 --> 39:50.671
HER RECORDING STUDIO?

39:50.671 --> 39:52.833
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU'RE NOT HERE.

39:52.833 --> 39:53.994
I ALWAYS WANTED TO SING.

39:53.994 --> 39:55.235
AND RUFUS
HAS PRO TOOLS.

39:55.235 --> 39:57.838
RUFUS IS MY NEW BOYFRIEND.
YOU DIDN'T ASK.

39:57.838 --> 39:59.079
HE'S YOUNGER.
NOT AS YOUNG AS

39:59.079 --> 40:00.521
SUSAN SARANDON'S BOYFRIEND,

40:00.521 --> 40:01.562
BUT HE'S YOUNGER THAN ME.

40:01.562 --> 40:02.683
WELL, GREAT.

40:02.683 --> 40:04.004
‐ YOU HAVE THE‐‐
‐ HE'S 35.

40:04.004 --> 40:05.806
I HAVE A 35‐YEAR‐OLD
BOYFRIEND.

40:05.806 --> 40:06.927
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

40:06.927 --> 40:08.048
NOT AT ALL.

40:08.048 --> 40:10.050
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUN?
OCEANOGRAPHY.

40:10.050 --> 40:11.211
‐ WHAT?
‐ <i>NOTHING.</i>

40:11.211 --> 40:14.214
SO, YOU'RE BUYING A CONDO.

40:14.214 --> 40:15.295
<i>I AM!</i>

40:15.295 --> 40:16.577
MY FRIEND JENNY,

40:16.577 --> 40:18.058
SHE WAS LOOKING
AT IT FIRST.

40:18.058 --> 40:19.499
SHE WANTED TO TURN
THE BONUS ROOM INTO
A GYM,

40:19.499 --> 40:21.421
BUT IT'S GONNA MAKE A MUCH
BETTER RECORDING STUDIO.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.063
I THOUGHT I'D TRY
COUNTRY AND WESTERN

40:23.063 --> 40:24.424
BECAUSE I LOOK
GOOD IN HATS.

40:24.424 --> 40:25.946
SILLY REASON, RIGHT?

40:25.946 --> 40:26.987
‐ YES.
‐ NO.

40:26.987 --> 40:28.228
YES.

40:28.228 --> 40:29.790
‐ HERE'S YOUR COFFEE.
‐ THANK YOU.

40:29.790 --> 40:30.991
THANK YOU.

40:30.991 --> 40:32.513
THOSE ARE UNFAMILIAR WORDS.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.074
SCOTTY, TELL SHANIA TWAIN

40:34.074 --> 40:35.075
EYES ON HER OWN PAPER.

40:35.075 --> 40:36.476
MOM, PLEASE.

40:36.476 --> 40:37.798
OH YES.

40:37.798 --> 40:40.440
IT'S JUST YOUR STANDARD
LEGAL BLAH BLAH BLAH.

40:40.440 --> 40:42.162
( sighs )
I DON'T SEE WHERE

40:42.162 --> 40:44.004
THE GUARDIAN'S SIGNATURE
IS SUPPOSED TO GO.

40:44.004 --> 40:45.325
THE WHAT?

40:45.325 --> 40:46.326
RIGHT THERE, I THINK.

40:46.326 --> 40:47.848
THE GUARDIAN'S
SIGNATURE?

40:47.848 --> 40:49.209
MY PEN'S DEAD.
YOU GOT A PEN?

40:49.209 --> 40:51.131
HELLO? GUARDIAN SIGNATURE,
WHAT'S A GUARDIAN SIGNATURE?

40:51.131 --> 40:54.374
SCOTTY SCOTTY SCOTTY
SCOTTY SCOTTY SCOTTY
SCOTTY.

40:54.374 --> 40:55.976
( sighs )

40:55.976 --> 40:57.297
I'M MOM'S GUARDIAN.

40:57.297 --> 40:59.660
I HAVE TO SIGN ALL HER
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, OKAY?

40:59.660 --> 41:01.822
HOW MANY WAYS
CAN I SAY NO?

41:01.822 --> 41:03.664
LOOK, SHE GOT
INTO A SITUATION.

41:03.664 --> 41:04.745
THAT'S SHOCKING.

41:04.745 --> 41:06.146
SHE BOUGHT A HOUSE
WITH A BOYFRIEND‐‐

41:06.146 --> 41:07.508
NOT RUFUS.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.949
AND HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO PAY HALF,

41:08.949 --> 41:10.190
BUT THEY BROKE UP

41:10.190 --> 41:11.391
AND MOM DIDN'T WANT TO
GET STUCK WITH A HOUSE.

41:11.391 --> 41:12.392
BUT THE ONLY WAY
TO GET HER OUT OF IT

41:12.392 --> 41:13.674
WAS TO HAVE HER
DECLARED INCOMPETENT

41:13.674 --> 41:15.796
WHICH INVOLVED ME
BECOMING HER GUARDIAN.

41:15.796 --> 41:17.397
ARE YOU OUT OF
YOUR FREAKING MIND?

41:17.397 --> 41:19.079
PLEASE, JUST
STAY OUT OF THIS.

41:19.079 --> 41:20.641
HOW DID YOU LET HER
CON YOU INTO THIS?

41:20.641 --> 41:22.683
SHE HAD TO GET RID OF THE HOUSE
IN ORDER TO GET THE CONDO.

41:22.683 --> 41:25.005
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND
THE FULL CRAZY HERE.

41:25.005 --> 41:26.927
SHE HAD HERSELF
DECLARED INCOMPETENT

41:26.927 --> 41:28.088
TO GET OUT OF
A PLACE TO LIVE

41:28.088 --> 41:29.570
IN ORDER TO GET
A DIFFERENT PLACE TO LIVE.

41:29.570 --> 41:30.811
WELL, SHE WAS
SUPPOSED TO‐‐

41:30.811 --> 41:32.813
NO. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO THE CRAZY YET.

41:32.813 --> 41:34.575
SHE HAD HERSELF
DECLARED INCOMPETENT

41:34.575 --> 41:35.656
TO GET OUT OF
A PLACE TO LIVE

41:35.656 --> 41:36.897
AND YOU HELPED HER!

41:36.897 --> 41:38.058
SHE CERTAINLY CAN'T
EXPECT ME TO LIVE

41:38.058 --> 41:39.379
IN A PLACE WITH
SO MANY MEMORIES.

41:39.379 --> 41:41.061
WHO CO‐SIGNS ON A HOUSE

41:41.061 --> 41:43.143
WITH A GUY THEY KNOW
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT WITH?

41:43.143 --> 41:43.984
WELL,
SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

41:43.984 --> 41:45.145
IT NEVER WORKS OUT.

41:45.145 --> 41:46.947
<i>IT WILL WITH RUFUS.</i>

41:46.947 --> 41:47.988
SCOTTY, LEAVE HERE
WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

41:47.988 --> 41:49.109
JUST LET ME SIGN THIS.

41:49.109 --> 41:50.390
SHE WILL GET YOU
INTO TROUBLE.

41:50.390 --> 41:51.832
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT SHE DOES.

41:51.832 --> 41:53.994
SHE DRAGS EVERYONE
INTO HER HOLE OF DESTRUCTION,

41:53.994 --> 41:55.516
THEN SOMEHOW
SHE CLIMBS OUT

41:55.516 --> 41:56.997
‐ AND LEAVES YOU THERE.
‐ SO DRAMATIC.

41:56.997 --> 41:58.999
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE
THE COUNTRY SINGER.

41:58.999 --> 42:00.681
MOM CALLED ME
AND NEEDED HELP.

42:00.681 --> 42:01.682
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

42:01.682 --> 42:03.083
CHANGE YOUR NUMBER A LOT.

42:03.083 --> 42:04.004
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

42:04.004 --> 42:05.766
SHE ACTS LIKE
I CALL HER.

42:05.766 --> 42:07.768
I'M NOT THAT DESPERATE.
I HAVE FRIENDS.

42:07.768 --> 42:09.209
I'M MAKING A RECORD.

42:09.209 --> 42:11.972
<i>I DON'T SEE HOW IT'S ANY</i>
<i>OF HER BUSINESS ANYHOW.</i>

42:11.972 --> 42:13.814
SHE HASN'T CARED
FOR 12 YEARS.

42:13.814 --> 42:15.536
12 1/2.

42:15.536 --> 42:17.658
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT MATTERS TO HER NOW.

42:19.059 --> 42:20.981
THERE, MOM.

42:20.981 --> 42:22.382
TAKE IT.

42:25.546 --> 42:26.547
MICHELLE?

42:29.389 --> 42:32.673
I JUST WANTED
TO SEE YOUR FACE.

42:37.397 --> 42:38.999
( grunts )

42:38.999 --> 42:41.241
WELL, DOOR‐TO‐DOOR
SERVICE

42:41.241 --> 42:43.403
AND I DO ACCEPT
GRATUITIES.

42:45.405 --> 42:47.007
YOU CAN'T FREEZE
ME OUT FOREVER.

42:47.007 --> 42:49.850
YES, I CAN.

42:49.850 --> 42:51.011
BUT I WON'T.

42:56.817 --> 42:58.378
I SHOULD GET GOING.

42:58.378 --> 43:01.822
GIVE ME SOME WARNING
BEFORE YOU GET MARRIED AGAIN.

43:01.822 --> 43:02.983
THERE'S USUALLY
NOT THAT MUCH TIME.

43:02.983 --> 43:03.984
( chuckles )

43:13.393 --> 43:15.996
I'LL SLEEP
AT MY PLACE TOMORROW.
