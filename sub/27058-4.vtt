Once the world was full of wonders,

00:25.522 --> 00:27.430
but it belongs to humans now.

00:28.219 --> 00:30.290
We creatures
have all but disappeared -

00:32.183 --> 00:35.429
demons, vampires and witches...

00:35.431 --> 00:37.423
hiding in plain sight,

00:37.425 --> 00:39.110
fearful of discovery,

00:39.112 --> 00:41.232
ill at ease, even with each other.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.153
But, as my father used to say...

00:46.058 --> 00:47.378
in every ending

00:48.653 --> 00:50.813
there is a new beginning.

00:53.730 --> 00:55.648
Do the villagers know about you?

00:55.650 --> 01:00.610
Yes. Like witches, vampires are always
safer when they're in a community.

01:12.690 --> 01:14.370
Is your mother expecting us?

01:15.970 --> 01:17.290
Yeah.

01:42.290 --> 01:45.248
Diana. This is my mother.

01:45.250 --> 01:47.450
Ysabeau de Clermont.

01:48.610 --> 01:49.930
Well?

01:51.450 --> 01:54.810
Shall we go inside or continue
the greetings out here?

01:56.970 --> 01:58.450
After you.

02:00.930 --> 02:03.648
You might have shown
some consideration, Matthew.

02:03.650 --> 02:06.368
I thought you prided yourself
on being a radical.

02:06.370 --> 02:08.449
I have never been a radical.

02:10.210 --> 02:12.528
Change is overrated.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.730
Thank you for having me
in your home.

02:19.490 --> 02:20.930
She's pleased to meet you.

02:21.970 --> 02:25.768
Of course, she speaks
only English and New French.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.090
Modern warmbloods
are so poorly educated.

02:30.410 --> 02:31.928
Matthew!

02:31.930 --> 02:33.450
Ah, Marthe.

02:38.370 --> 02:41.448
-This is my friend, Diana.
-Welcome.

02:41.450 --> 02:43.968
Marthe has been with
our family for centuries.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.890
-Thank you.
-She needs some rest.

02:46.450 --> 02:48.328
It's been a long journey.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.088
I'll make up her room.

02:50.090 --> 02:52.770
No, I'll do it.
She'll be sleeping in my tower.

03:09.210 --> 03:10.770
You need to get some sleep.

03:12.450 --> 03:15.608
-You must be tired to.
-Oh, vampires don't sleep often.

03:15.610 --> 03:18.528
Not in the same way
you warmbloods do.

03:18.530 --> 03:21.368
Your mother doesn't want me here.

03:21.370 --> 03:24.568
It's been a long time since
anyone other than family

03:24.570 --> 03:26.370
has visited Sept-Tours.

03:27.570 --> 03:30.250
Not since my step-father
Philippe's death.

03:32.050 --> 03:33.970
What happened to him?

03:36.330 --> 03:37.650
He was killed.

03:38.570 --> 03:40.330
During World War Two.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.728
I'll be downstairs.

03:43.730 --> 03:47.370
Just...
call me if you need anything.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.568
At least they got there safely.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.888
And witches won't mess with Ysabeau.

04:03.890 --> 04:07.370
Ysabeau's more likely to rip off
Diana Bishop's head than they are.

04:10.570 --> 04:11.890
Marcus?

04:15.970 --> 04:17.290
Marcus?

04:19.890 --> 04:21.529
Marcus, are you there?

04:27.170 --> 04:28.650
Hello, Marcus.

04:29.810 --> 04:32.208
Juliette. What are you doing here?

04:32.210 --> 04:33.570
Where is he?

04:36.490 --> 04:38.808
Is he chasing after that witch?

04:38.810 --> 04:40.368
What witch?

04:40.370 --> 04:44.648
If you don't tell me,
Gerbert will be very angry with me.

04:44.650 --> 04:47.088
Do you really think I care?

04:47.090 --> 04:49.208
-Does he miss me?
-He's moved on.

04:49.210 --> 04:51.850
He doesn't think of you, ever!

05:08.530 --> 05:10.290
Can't do anything on your own,
can you?

05:11.330 --> 05:13.490
Always need someone
to take care of you.

05:14.850 --> 05:17.010
Tell Matthew I called.

05:17.970 --> 05:21.850
Eternity's a long time to be chasing
a man who doesn't want you, Juliette.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.730
I don't want that room open
while she's here.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.810
I have some work to do.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.730
I'd like to use Philippe's office.

05:58.610 --> 06:00.330
Maman, I need the key.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.168
I don't want to fight.

06:05.170 --> 06:09.130
-I'm not fighting.
-Diana didn't kill Philippe.

06:15.730 --> 06:17.050
Thank you.

06:18.050 --> 06:21.770
Her kind killed him, nobody else.

06:30.690 --> 06:34.090
Do you truly understand
what you're exposing us to?

07:21.570 --> 07:22.890
Mum?

07:24.610 --> 07:25.930
Mum?

07:29.170 --> 07:31.850
-Diana.
-Mum?

07:34.530 --> 07:35.850
Diana!

08:01.890 --> 08:05.768
-Hello.
-Diana, your ringtone's changed.

08:05.770 --> 08:09.170
-Where are you?
-Oh, I had to leave Oxford.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.888
What? Why?

08:11.890 --> 08:14.808
Peter Knox threatened me.

08:14.810 --> 08:17.008
I think it was right for you to leave.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.250
He harassed your parents too.

08:21.130 --> 08:23.208
Honey, where are you?

08:23.210 --> 08:24.610
I'm with Matthew.

08:25.810 --> 08:28.410
-Where's he taken you?
-To his mother's house.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.690
-In France.
-His mother?

08:32.570 --> 08:34.568
-Ysabeau de Clermont?
-Yeah.

08:34.570 --> 08:36.490
You know her?

08:37.610 --> 08:41.128
Listen to me very carefully.
You need to get out of there...

08:41.130 --> 08:45.048
now.
She has destroyed entire covens.

08:45.050 --> 08:48.088
In the '50s and '60s,
South America...

08:48.090 --> 08:50.968
dozens of witches lost their lives,
many of them elderly.

08:50.970 --> 08:53.448
-Why would she do that?
-Why?

08:53.450 --> 08:55.648
Because she's a witch killer.

08:55.650 --> 08:57.690
Come home now, Diana.

09:13.290 --> 09:14.808
-Demons.
-Yes.

09:14.810 --> 09:16.328
That's Agatha Wilson.

09:16.330 --> 09:19.048
-Their leader.
-You won't tell them about the book?

09:19.050 --> 09:22.208
No, of course not,
but we need their support.

09:22.210 --> 09:25.328
Agatha. Please meet Satu Järvinen.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.608
-Our new witch on the Congregation.
-Nice to meet you.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.208
Agatha's always telling us how
we need to up our women count.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.248
Which doesn't go down well
with the vampire colleagues.

09:33.250 --> 09:34.768
Why?

09:34.770 --> 09:37.888
It seems to me that every vampire
appointed over the last 900 years

09:37.890 --> 09:39.808
-has been a white male.
-Finished, Agatha?

09:39.810 --> 09:42.490
Actually, Baldwin,
I'd only just started.

09:44.570 --> 09:45.890
Gentlemen.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.930
Now we're all gathered...

11:04.770 --> 11:06.090
Merde!

11:19.620 --> 11:21.500
I bring this meeting to order.

11:23.900 --> 11:27.258
Peter Knox has called
this emergency session.

11:27.260 --> 11:28.620
Thank you.

11:31.620 --> 11:33.500
On behalf of the witches...

11:34.580 --> 11:37.260
I formerly request
the assistance of this chamber.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.938
Congregation rules have been broken.

11:41.940 --> 11:45.020
-By whom?
-Matthew de Clermont.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.700
Your brother has abducted a witch.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.658
Does your mother use the whole house?

12:07.660 --> 12:10.540
Well, she used to.
Now most of it's closed up.

12:14.380 --> 12:16.180
That used to be Philippe's office.

12:18.300 --> 12:21.380
I know you told me he died
in the Second World War.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.818
Then Ysabeau spent
the next few decades

12:25.820 --> 12:28.500
wiping out covens in South America.

12:33.540 --> 12:37.700
I remember my aunts telling me that
some witches worked with the Nazis.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.498
They played a part in his death.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.820
Yes.

12:45.380 --> 12:47.300
But that has nothing to do with you.

12:49.180 --> 12:50.660
For her it does.

12:58.100 --> 12:59.820
Take that out.
It's been in there long enough.

13:06.180 --> 13:07.658
What's wrong?

13:07.660 --> 13:09.100
I know my results are back.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.540
Why aren't you telling me
what's in them?

13:13.580 --> 13:17.178
No one hands out results without
the appropriate tests being run.

13:17.180 --> 13:19.458
And I need a second opinion
from Matthew.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.898
For fuck's sake, Miriam!
Stop buying time.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.260
I need to know
what happened with James.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.938
There are markers in there
that we've seen before

13:29.940 --> 13:31.980
in other cases of failed sirings.

13:36.060 --> 13:39.380
-It's Baldwin.
-Here we go. Defcon 1.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.138
Baldwin.

13:43.140 --> 13:46.218
-Does Matthew want to cause a war?
-No.

13:46.220 --> 13:48.538
Then explain what the hell he's doing.

13:48.540 --> 13:51.218
-What was he thinking?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?

13:51.220 --> 13:53.978
I've tried. He's not picking up.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.740
Does he have the witch?

13:57.780 --> 13:59.658
He may be your father...

13:59.660 --> 14:02.900
but unfortunately for me
he's also a De Clermont.

14:04.180 --> 14:07.860
As head of your family,
you can't refuse me.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.180
Where is he?

14:13.820 --> 14:15.978
Her name's Rakasa.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.298
My mother used to ride her,
but, er...

14:18.300 --> 14:21.138
-She has a quieter horse now.
-Well?

14:21.140 --> 14:22.618
She's nice.

14:22.620 --> 14:26.298
I haven't smelt such power
for centuries.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.458
Sweet and green.

14:28.460 --> 14:31.098
Like the spring.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.578
Mind your head.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.380
She's bewitched him.

14:51.060 --> 14:52.938
What's her name mean?

14:52.940 --> 14:54.618
Nar Rakasa's Arabic.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.498
It means "fire dancer".

14:56.500 --> 14:58.540
Let's see you dance then.

14:59.380 --> 15:01.338
Yah! Come on!

15:01.340 --> 15:02.660
Yah!

15:11.940 --> 15:13.580
Slow down!

15:45.860 --> 15:48.980
As you can see,
he's been stalking her.

15:50.620 --> 15:54.138
And now she's disappeared
from her rooms.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.780
No doubt abducted
by Matthew de Clermont.

15:57.980 --> 15:59.938
Your father set up the Congregation

15:59.940 --> 16:02.698
to avoid drawing human attention to us

16:02.700 --> 16:05.018
and to keep peace amongst the species.

16:05.020 --> 16:07.178
Your brother has broken that peace.

16:07.180 --> 16:10.698
If this is true, then I'm afraid
Matthew must be brought to account.

16:10.700 --> 16:13.138
What I don't understand
is why he'd want to do it.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.260
The lineage is distinguished,
isn't that right?

16:16.740 --> 16:18.818
-Is she powerful?
-No.

16:18.820 --> 16:21.938
She was tested as a child.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.418
So if she did have the power,
it would have come up then.

16:24.420 --> 16:28.418
No, we're straying from the point,
which is, where is she

16:28.420 --> 16:30.378
and how are you going to get her back?

16:30.380 --> 16:34.340
Yes, but she is the only creature
who has found The Book Of Life.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.818
Is that true?

16:40.820 --> 16:43.018
Peter has failed to provide us
with the full facts, as usual.

16:43.020 --> 16:44.538
-Take that back!
-Oh, come on,

16:44.540 --> 16:46.018
we all know you lie like thieves.

16:46.020 --> 16:47.578
If she's found the book,
she must bring it here to us.

16:47.580 --> 16:51.098
She doesn't have The Book Of Life.
But she does know how to retrieve it.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.898
And you were going to keep
that information to yourself?

16:52.900 --> 16:55.178
At least I haven't snatched her
like Matthew de Clermont.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.100
-It belongs to all of us, Peter!
-Enough!

17:00.660 --> 17:02.900
My brother does have the witch.

17:03.820 --> 17:06.258
He's taken her to Sept-Tours.

17:06.260 --> 17:09.338
We will send
a Congregation representative

17:09.339 --> 17:12.099
and he will hand her over
for investigation.

17:15.020 --> 17:18.900
You know, your mother's right,
I should go home.

17:20.900 --> 17:22.978
I don't want you to feel
responsible for me

17:22.980 --> 17:25.377
and your mother
does not want me here.

17:25.380 --> 17:27.498
Her bark's worse than her bite.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.018
Well, maybe, but Sarah's right. I...

17:31.020 --> 17:32.978
I should be with them.

17:32.980 --> 17:36.178
And the Madison coven,
they can protect me.

17:36.180 --> 17:41.578
You can't go back to Madison.
It's not safe amongst the witches.

17:41.580 --> 17:44.138
I'm not going to go
into hiding my whole life.

17:44.140 --> 17:46.618
I have to face Knox
at some point, Matthew.

17:46.620 --> 17:49.020
It's not just about Knox.

17:56.620 --> 17:58.500
The photographs of your parents.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.898
They were staged...

18:01.900 --> 18:05.578
to make it look like a fear of
devil worship, but I examined them.

18:05.580 --> 18:08.458
Underneath the debris

18:08.460 --> 18:10.540
there was a chalk circle.

18:11.580 --> 18:15.778
A witches' circle.

18:15.780 --> 18:18.338
Your parents weren't killed by humans.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.500
Your parents were killed...

18:21.540 --> 18:23.020
by witches.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.420
I'm sorry.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.820
Diana.

18:47.380 --> 18:50.100
Why didn't you tell me
you tested Diana Bishop?

18:54.700 --> 18:57.140
You missed her power.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.740
How could you have?

19:02.380 --> 19:04.420
Stirred to motion.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.820
Rest what is and what shall be.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.780
Rest all things that be.

19:19.340 --> 19:22.458
I brought you here
to serve as my ally.

19:22.460 --> 19:25.980
Not to look up information
and use it against me.

19:30.780 --> 19:32.820
In the Salem trials...

19:34.260 --> 19:36.580
when a witch refused to plead...

19:38.220 --> 19:41.380
humans crushed them to death
with weights.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.100
Shall I treat you as a human would?

20:08.260 --> 20:12.380
We can only protect ourselves
against humans and other creatures...

20:13.380 --> 20:15.180
if we work together.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.198
Hey, Mum.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.678
-How's Sophie?
-Yeah, good, yeah.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.518
-The baby's started moving.
-Great.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.118
Can I talk to her?

21:09.120 --> 21:10.798
Did you speak to them about the rules?

21:10.800 --> 21:12.918
I didn't get a chance.
It's been chaos here.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.918
-Put Sophie on, will you?
-It's Mum.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.240
Oh?

21:18.240 --> 21:19.718
Hi!

21:19.720 --> 21:22.600
That statue of the huntress
that you were given by your family.

21:23.600 --> 21:25.240
Why do you link it to alchemy?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.838
Because the moon
in her hair reminds me

21:28.840 --> 21:30.598
of the White Queen in the books.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.760
And the person I have to give it to,
she's in alchemy, too.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.878
-How do you know?
-Well, I've had visions of her.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.958
She's in this castle
with seven towers.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.718
Seven's the big number in alchemy.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.998
Seven planets, seven metals.
Even the transformation process...

21:46.000 --> 21:47.840
has seven stages.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.598
It hasn't started yet though.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.238
It must be beginning.
She's with her Dark King.

21:54.240 --> 21:56.078
And you dreamt about him, too?

21:56.080 --> 22:00.558
He's distant. I can see her face.
I can't see his.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.758
-Sophie...
-The session will recommence

22:02.760 --> 22:05.958
-in ten minutes.
-You mustn't talk to anybody about this.

22:05.960 --> 22:10.880
Why would I?
Do you know who she is?

22:11.360 --> 22:13.238
I might.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.718
-Then you need to get me to meet her.
-No.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.238
She's in trouble
with the Congregation.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.198
She's broken God knows how many rules.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.598
I don't want you
getting mixed up with her.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.560
She knows who she is.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.160
Diana.

22:56.680 --> 22:58.278
Does she know?

22:58.280 --> 22:59.600
Yes.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.120
Yes, I just told her.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.320
And?

23:06.560 --> 23:09.280
Well, she's not falling apart,
if that's what you were hoping.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.120
One of the reasons
I'm drawn to her is her bravery.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.000
She reminds me of you.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.918
You were open-minded once.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.838
Loved everyone for who they were.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.960
Why can't you at least try?

23:40.480 --> 23:43.038
Matthew won't keep the book
for himself.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.158
If he gets hold of it,
he'll bring it to me.

23:45.160 --> 23:47.918
Are you sure? He does what he wants.
Always has.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.040
I have him under control.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.800
Doesn't seem like it.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.758
The witches on the Congregation
are plotting for more power.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.118
Even the demons have become unruly.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.358
We used to rule with an iron fist.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.600
It's the 21st century, Gerbert.

24:05.680 --> 24:08.640
We must at least show
a semblance of democracy.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.998
And Matthew's behavior
has weakened us further.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.200
Your family affairs are
compromising all of us.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.920
After eight centuries of rule.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.280
Do you know what I think?

24:29.480 --> 24:30.800
I think...

24:34.480 --> 24:38.520
the De Clermonts
are finally losing their grip.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.880
Didn't my son warn you
not to move from his tower?

25:04.520 --> 25:05.840
Yes.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.078
You should listen to him.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.238
This was your husband's office.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.598
It's still his office.

25:13.600 --> 25:15.480
It always will be.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.800
How exactly did he die?

25:21.800 --> 25:25.240
How dare you ask me that?

25:29.560 --> 25:31.520
My parents were murdered.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.640
-By witches.
-Who are capable of anything.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.280
There is good and evil
in every species.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.200
My parents were the best.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.958
And I'm a witch...

25:47.960 --> 25:50.918
who's willing to make up my own mind,

25:50.920 --> 25:53.160
despite the stories
I've heard about you.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.120
Why were they killed?

26:06.280 --> 26:07.800
I don't know.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.760
Whoever did it, make them pay.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.360
It doesn't take the pain away.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.160
But it helps.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.558
Do all vampires love red wine
like you do?

26:45.560 --> 26:48.358
Actually, most vampires
drink a lot more than we do.

26:48.360 --> 26:51.438
Our family's known for its restraint.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.560
With regard to wine perhaps.

26:54.560 --> 26:58.400
It doesn't have the same effect on us
as it does on warmbloods.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.798
Thank you for letting me ride Rakasa.

27:02.800 --> 27:06.640
She's too willful for my liking.
Fiddat's more biddable.

27:07.640 --> 27:11.078
As I get older, I find that quality
admirable in horses.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.640
And in sons.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.598
You didn't need to light that for me.

27:23.600 --> 27:27.360
It's good to have a fire. We haven't
had one in that grate for too long.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.000
This is a wonderful room for a party.

27:32.760 --> 27:35.118
We used to celebrate Christmas
in here.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.238
We'd invite all the villagers,
the family would come too.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.598
-Do you remember, Matthew?
-Mm.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.600
Louisa would dance
with anyone and everyone.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.320
You didn't exactly hold back.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.120
Maman.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.960
I'm not sure you'd like this one.

28:45.520 --> 28:48.278
Come on.
Your turn.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.118
I'm not a dancer.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.440
Neither am I.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.958
Come on, just give it a try.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.758
I am not exactly a great dancer either
but it could be fun.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.518
-That's not true.
-All right.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.560
The secret is, go back on this one
to start off with.

29:02.680 --> 29:04.480
Pretty good.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.398
Let him lead!

29:11.400 --> 29:14.040
Your dance, at least.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.240
Come on, spin. To me.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.920
To me.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.120
Yes!

29:44.880 --> 29:46.360
My God.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.760
Diana.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.800
Extraordinary.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.720
That's the first time I've seen you
enjoying your magic.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.760
I'm glad it's happening
when I'm with you.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.000
What spell have you put on me?

31:06.080 --> 31:07.558
Goodbye.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.878
-Goodnight, Gillian.
-See you at the next coven meeting.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.678
-Thanks for coming. Bye!
-Goodnight.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.040
-Goodnight.
-Bye.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.360
Bye!

31:19.640 --> 31:23.438
Diana is with Matthew Clairmont
at his family home.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.918
Oh, no.

31:24.920 --> 31:27.238
Do you think he forced her
or she went willingly?

31:27.240 --> 31:29.958
-I can't believe she'd do that.
-Why?

31:29.960 --> 31:33.758
She half killed us all with
witch wind. She's capable...

31:33.760 --> 31:36.478
-Thank you so much.
-Oh, it's pleasure. Bye-bye.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.958
-Bye!
-À bientôt.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.400
À la prochaine.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.598
Gillian, she is capable of anything.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.238
Maybe she doesn't understand.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.878
I don't think she knows
much about Congregations.

31:48.880 --> 31:51.320
Because she willingly
kept herself ignorant.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.558
-What will they do to her?
-They'll interrogate her.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.798
-She has a lot to answer for.
-What about Matthew Clairmont?

31:59.800 --> 32:01.558
He'll be punished too.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.478
Of course, the more information
we have on him, the better.

32:04.480 --> 32:09.640
Peter Knox wants us to find out
exactly what he was doing in Oxford.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.400
Mm?

32:23.480 --> 32:27.158
Will you please tell me
about William Harvey?

32:27.160 --> 32:31.758
Well... It's not a particularly
interesting story.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.078
Well, maybe not to you,
but to this historian,

32:34.080 --> 32:36.958
it is the closest thing
I'll get to meeting the man

32:36.960 --> 32:39.240
that discovered
that the heart is a pump.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.200
Matthew.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.960
Domenico.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.718
-It's been years.
-When was the last time?

32:53.720 --> 32:55.198
In Ferrara?

32:55.200 --> 32:58.358
We were both fighting the Pope.
I was trying to save Venice.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.798
-You, the Knights Templar.
-Why are you here?

33:01.800 --> 33:03.120
Ah!

33:03.760 --> 33:07.320
And this must be the witch
I've heard so much about.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.320
Diana, go back to the house.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.798
-Go.
-I'm not going anywhere.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.198
Domenico. What an unexpected visit.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.918
Ysabeau, it's a pleasure to see you.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.838
How did you know I was here?

33:22.840 --> 33:25.118
-I smelled you.
-Maman.

33:25.120 --> 33:27.518
Take Diana back to the house.

33:27.520 --> 33:30.680
I think she should stay
until I deliver my message.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.278
Diana Bishop,

33:35.280 --> 33:38.158
you must come before the Congregation
for questioning

33:38.160 --> 33:40.078
and to hand over The Book Of Life.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.758
You tell the Congregation
that I don't have it.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.758
If they want it,
they can get it themselves.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.638
But you must come and tell us how to.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.918
Diana will not be going
anywhere with you.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.440
Are you refusing to let me
carry out Congregation orders?

33:54.760 --> 33:56.080
I am.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.078
You do know the consequences?

34:01.080 --> 34:03.678
-Yes, I do!
-Matthew, please, don't do this.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.800
Ah, it's not about the book, is it?

34:09.199 --> 34:10.520
No.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.960
It's about her.

34:14.440 --> 34:16.600
You're breaking the Covenant.

34:18.360 --> 34:20.838
What is the Covenant?
What is he talking about?

34:20.840 --> 34:23.560
She doesn't even know, Matthew.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.960
You've lost your mind.

34:37.560 --> 34:39.280
Take her back now!

34:44.360 --> 34:46.358
One twitch and I will
rip your head off!

34:46.360 --> 34:51.000
You've delivered your message
and you've been answered.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.679
Now, leave!

35:00.760 --> 35:02.878
We'll hunt you down.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.360
I'll kill you both.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.760
Even De Clermonts can die.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.758
The Book Of Life?

35:19.760 --> 35:21.600
Why didn't you say?

35:23.480 --> 35:25.878
It was what drew me to her.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.240
And then it became
about something else.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.160
Maman.

35:32.680 --> 35:34.360
I can see that.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.560
And so can Domenico.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.038
Give her to them.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.040
They won't kill her if you do.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.200
They will if you don't.

36:02.735 --> 36:04.455
What is the Covenant?

36:05.775 --> 36:07.575
You really don't know?

36:10.095 --> 36:12.735
It forbids interspecies relationships.

36:15.135 --> 36:17.173
That's insane.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.613
Why would anyone ever agree to that?

36:19.615 --> 36:22.933
There were a lot more
of us creatures back then.

36:22.935 --> 36:25.455
And we'd grown accustomed
to taking what we wanted.

36:26.655 --> 36:31.413
Philippe decided that if creatures
from different species mated,

36:31.415 --> 36:33.895
it might upset the balance of power.

36:34.895 --> 36:36.373
So...

36:36.375 --> 36:39.175
the Covenant was drawn up.

36:43.215 --> 36:45.215
What happens when creatures break it?

36:47.255 --> 36:49.935
To my knowledge,
it never has been broken.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.933
He's gone.

36:58.935 --> 37:01.495
There'll be no more visits
from the Congregation.

37:02.975 --> 37:04.693
How do you know that?

37:04.695 --> 37:07.135
Because we're not going
to break the Covenant.

37:11.535 --> 37:13.413
You're giving in?

37:13.415 --> 37:17.613
Domenico's visit was a diplomatic
mission. The next one will not be.

37:17.615 --> 37:20.455
Even if we stood up to them,
what then? Hmm?

37:21.815 --> 37:25.733
We'd be opening up old animosities
that would spiral out of control

37:25.735 --> 37:27.933
and expose us to humans.

37:27.935 --> 37:30.135
I won't let that happen.

37:31.135 --> 37:32.855
So that's it?

37:33.975 --> 37:37.453
We're just going to abide by some
ancient, narrow-minded agreement

37:37.455 --> 37:39.255
that was made a thousand years ago?

37:40.455 --> 37:41.775
Yes.

37:42.455 --> 37:43.775
No.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.855
We are bound together.

37:51.055 --> 37:54.093
My magic started coming out
when I met you.

37:54.095 --> 37:56.335
Three weeks ago,
you'd never even heard of me.

37:58.095 --> 37:59.575
You don't know me!

38:00.535 --> 38:03.935
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

38:06.455 --> 38:09.375
You don't even know yourself.

38:12.575 --> 38:13.895
Stop.

38:14.735 --> 38:16.055
Stop it.

38:19.535 --> 38:21.695
Why are you being like this?

38:34.495 --> 38:35.815
Yes?

38:38.535 --> 38:40.015
Is there damage?

38:41.615 --> 38:43.335
I'll get there as soon as I can.

38:46.335 --> 38:48.135
Someone broke into the lab.

38:49.815 --> 38:52.653
-I have to get back to Oxford.
-I'll get my things.

38:52.655 --> 38:56.135
-You're not coming.
-Diana should go back to her aunts.

39:00.575 --> 39:02.173
She's staying here.

39:02.175 --> 39:05.215
-Maman...
-Stop making decisions for me.

39:08.135 --> 39:09.855
Guard her with your life.

39:14.575 --> 39:16.055
Yes, Matthew.

39:18.695 --> 39:20.615
Leaving me isn't the answer.

39:25.175 --> 39:26.895
I love you.

39:29.975 --> 39:31.735
Tell me how you feel.

39:32.735 --> 39:35.255
Forget the Covenant,
forget the Congregation.

39:38.375 --> 39:40.813
How do you feel?

39:40.815 --> 39:43.093
You know how I feel.

39:43.095 --> 39:44.495
Say it!

39:57.095 --> 39:58.775
Let him go.

41:08.295 --> 41:09.615
Look!

41:10.775 --> 41:14.095
My God!
She's doing this.

41:37.065 --> 41:38.543
The lab's secured.

41:38.545 --> 41:40.743
It was witches.
Their scent was everywhere.

41:40.745 --> 41:43.863
-You think this was about Diana?
-Of course this is about Diana.

41:43.865 --> 41:45.663
This is what I wanted you to see.

41:45.665 --> 41:47.543
You fear I shall come
to know your past?

41:47.545 --> 41:49.143
Who are Blanca and Lucas?

41:49.145 --> 41:50.983
I don't want you to worry about that.

41:50.985 --> 41:54.423
It appears the vampires
are studying witches' DNA.

41:54.425 --> 41:57.623
-What's Clairmont up to?
-This changes everything, everything.

41:57.625 --> 41:59.783
Witches and vampires
can't be together.

41:59.785 --> 42:02.103
You cannot put yourself
in that danger.

42:02.105 --> 42:03.823
I will never leave him.

42:03.825 --> 42:07.583
The witches will think that Diana
has turned her back on her own kind

42:07.585 --> 42:09.245
and they will come.

42:09.247 --> 42:12.770
I need to show you something.
You might not like what you see.
