WEBVTT

00:36.370 --> 00:38.456
Come. It's gonna be fine.

00:38.581 --> 00:40.583
Nothing's going to happen to you.

00:41.751 --> 00:43.377
Please...

00:51.552 --> 00:52.845
Please...

00:55.639 --> 00:56.932
No.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.429
Take that with you.

03:37.468 --> 03:39.803
- Careful.
- Yes, sir.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.104
Were you shot?

03:49.230 --> 03:52.566
No. Get him out.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.444
- You're scaring him.
- Out!

04:02.159 --> 04:05.537
What happened last night...
someone pays.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.708
We took care of Calderón,

04:09.833 --> 04:13.087
but those fucking gringos
still knock on my door!

04:14.630 --> 04:16.840
Where the fuck were the guards?

04:18.175 --> 04:20.010
Where the fuck were our men?

04:21.595 --> 04:25.599
How the fuck did they know
where you were, Dad? How the fuck?

04:29.561 --> 04:31.605
We have a rat.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.482
An informant.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.193
They found my ledger.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.656
Hey, what about Enrique?

04:41.407 --> 04:45.494
He was manning the checkpoint
when the cops came in.

05:31.332 --> 05:34.335
Let's get inside.
Going once, going twice...

05:34.460 --> 05:36.128
Girls, please.

05:36.253 --> 05:40.299
No. You can't go out that way.
Please, no, sweetie.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.054
Honey, let's go inside. Inside.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.319
- Hello?
- 'Salcedo.'

06:00.444 --> 06:03.530
No one's seen you since the raid.
Where the fuck are you?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.616
David...

06:09.119 --> 06:12.414
I'm having some trouble
with my wife lately...

06:13.582 --> 06:15.334
...but I'm monitoring my radio.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.879
- Have you talked to Enrique?
- 'Why?'

06:21.048 --> 06:24.551
We've been trying to reach him.
My father wants to talk to him.

06:25.636 --> 06:27.638
Your dad wants to talk to Enrique?

06:28.514 --> 06:30.599
Do you have any problem with that?

06:32.935 --> 06:35.979
- I'll find him.
- 'Good. Bring him in.

06:36.105 --> 06:38.190
'And Salcedo, you come, too.'

06:52.538 --> 06:55.499
I stand by the operation, Minister,
as does General Serrano.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.751
Who was in Bogotá
at the time of the raid,

06:57.876 --> 07:00.170
while you and your men were there
for five hours,

07:00.295 --> 07:02.423
drilling holes, breaking furniture.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.633
We were one minute away
from getting Miguel Rodríguez.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.260
But you did not.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.013
I need you to hand over all intel,
including informants,

07:10.139 --> 07:12.558
over to a special prosecutor.

07:12.683 --> 07:16.019
And I'm afraid the DEA can no longer
be part of this operation.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.771
- You're taking us off?
- Yes, I am.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.233
Minister, we recovered something
from the house.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.572
It's a ledger.

07:28.824 --> 07:32.453
Cartel accounts, transactions,
going back years.

07:32.578 --> 07:35.247
- What is this? I don't see names.
- It's coded.

07:35.372 --> 07:39.543
It's bribes, money laundering...
cocaine sales.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.547
- Cali's whole operation.
- That's right.

07:45.007 --> 07:48.343
- You have someone who can read it?
- There are two possibilities.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.679
There's the cartel accountant,
Guillermo Pallomari.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.558
Yeah, but he's underground.
Maybe worse.

07:55.392 --> 07:58.145
And there's the money launderer
we extradited from Curaçao,

07:58.270 --> 07:59.938
Franklin Jurado.

08:00.063 --> 08:04.318
Jurado's the most important witness
to this case and he's in U.S. custody.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.738
We're not handing him over
to a special prosecutor.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.532
So you're welcome
to keep the ledger, Minister...

08:11.617 --> 08:14.620
...but we have the only guy
who can read it.

08:21.668 --> 08:26.798
Then, Agent Peña,
I suppose you have to see this out.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.179
- Ambassador.
- Minister.

08:43.607 --> 08:47.736
You make my job a lot fucking harder,
you know that?

08:47.861 --> 08:51.448
Now you told me the only way
Jurado talks is if you find his wife.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.787
Do you have any idea where she is?

08:58.080 --> 09:00.082
I know someone who might.

09:00.916 --> 09:03.210
'After the fall of Escobar,

09:03.335 --> 09:06.713
'Medellín went from being
the most dangerous city in Colombia

09:06.838 --> 09:08.882
'to one of its safest.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.426
'That wasn't a result
of the end of cocaine trafficking.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.303
'That was alive and well.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.973
'It was due to the new
godfather of Medellín.

09:17.057 --> 09:22.145
'His name is Diego Murillo,
but you know him as Don Berna.'

09:27.192 --> 09:29.319
Did you find her?

09:30.529 --> 09:32.281
Sure you don't want something?

09:32.406 --> 09:36.493
- The <i>picada</i> here is the shit.
- You have what I asked for or not?

09:40.122 --> 09:43.875
Pretty girl.
Long way from home.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.102
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.062
I'm imagining the headline...

10:04.187 --> 10:09.818
"American woman held hostage
in Colombian jungle." Fuck.

10:12.404 --> 10:15.073
- Thanks for the info.
- Wait.

10:17.326 --> 10:19.953
I'm going to help you
rescue the Barbie doll.

10:21.622 --> 10:26.293
To do this job, we need to work
with some old friends of ours.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.172
They can help us.

10:31.131 --> 10:35.719
They know the terrain like the back
of their hand. How to get in and out.

10:48.357 --> 10:50.817
What's it going to cost?

10:50.942 --> 10:52.653
Cheap.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.573
You just have to make me
a promise, Peña.

10:56.698 --> 11:00.994
When my name pops up
on the DEA to-do list,

11:01.119 --> 11:03.747
you pick up the phone and call me.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.834
So I can be cautious and protect myself.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.712
I see now...

11:12.673 --> 11:15.801
A get-out-of-jail-free card.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.262
Exactly.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.183
To us, Peña.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.771
Enrique!

11:29.773 --> 11:32.442
- Boss.
- Open the door. Quick.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.074
- Boss...
- What are you doing? Get in.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.829
- What happened?
- David's been calling.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.707
What for? He never called before.

11:46.832 --> 11:51.336
- I wanted to talk to you first.
- Last night was a big fuck up.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.797
You're in danger.
Pack a few things and let's go.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.428
Jorge, I swear. I radioed in.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.764
It doesn't matter, Enrique.
The DEA passed right in front of you.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.892
I should just run, bro.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.063
- Like Córdova?
- What? It doesn't matter!

12:10.647 --> 12:13.400
Stay, run.
It's the same fucking thing!

12:13.525 --> 12:15.485
No matter what I do,
I'm a fucking dead man.

12:15.610 --> 12:19.698
Nobody is going to die, you hear me?
Nobody is going to die.

12:20.532 --> 12:23.952
But right now, let's just get you
to tomorrow, Enrique.

12:35.297 --> 12:39.676
Just keep paging him until he hits us
back. Nothing else we can do.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.052
Fuck.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.681
We should've arrested him.

12:44.806 --> 12:49.019
You know, brought him in for assault
or something to save him.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.313
Fuck. I hope we didn't
hang him out to dry.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.651
I thought you didn't like him.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.613
Yeah, doesn't mean I want him dead.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.578
Why the fuck do I have
to hide here? I didn't do anything.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.955
I know you didn't do anything.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.708
This is David being an idiot.

13:13.335 --> 13:18.131
But... trust me.
Have some patience. I'll handle it.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.427
Jorge...

13:24.888 --> 13:27.224
Last week, when you told me
to not say anything

13:27.349 --> 13:30.435
about the DEA and their safe house...

13:31.895 --> 13:35.774
That has nothing to do with anything.
Why are you bringing this up?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.609
Stay focused.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.111
Sit down. Sit down.

13:45.951 --> 13:48.578
It's very important you do what I say.

13:48.703 --> 13:52.666
Don't leave this room.
And don't call anyone.

13:52.791 --> 13:57.462
Not your mother, your brother
or your girlfriend. No one. Understood?

13:59.965 --> 14:01.925
Hey, look at me.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.678
We'll get you through this.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.430
I promise.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.648
Thank you, Jorge.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.276
Seriously.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.952
- Jorge.
- Fercho, how's it going?

14:33.039 --> 14:34.457
Don Miguel...

14:34.583 --> 14:37.002
Where the fuck is Enrique, Jorge?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.966
I left him messages at his house,
at the tap room,

14:43.091 --> 14:45.093
but trust me, I'll find him.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.054
Regardless of where he is,
you know him as well as me.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.806
He's a man we can trust.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.019
The thing is, Jorge, I don't know Enrique.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.439
Because I didn't hire him, you did.

14:58.106 --> 15:01.610
No, Córdova hired him.
But that doesn't matter.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.237
I don't like to make judgments
before I know all the facts,

15:04.362 --> 15:06.823
and we don't know them, David.

15:06.948 --> 15:10.243
I find that funny, you know?

15:10.368 --> 15:13.705
Because lately,
you're missing too many facts.

15:13.830 --> 15:17.667
More specifically,
about the fucking DEA, Jorge. Huh?

15:17.792 --> 15:22.589
When the DEA burst into the building,
I was six feet away from your dad.

15:22.714 --> 15:28.053
Don Miguel, I've been investigating,
and it looks like Enrique did radio in.

15:28.178 --> 15:31.723
I think the DEA is using a signal
to interfere with our radios.

15:31.848 --> 15:32.974
Dad...

15:35.560 --> 15:36.978
Dad, please.

15:37.979 --> 15:41.232
It could be, it could be.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.818
But you know what, Jorge?

15:44.569 --> 15:48.323
That doesn't explain how the DEA
knew where I was. Do you understand?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.535
Yes, sir.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.499
Someone sang and I want to know
who the fuck it was.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.545
Find Enrique.
Let's have him speak for himself.

16:02.671 --> 16:05.590
We fucking fix this once and for all.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.489
- Hi, fellas.
- Sir.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.075
- Welcome.
- Hello.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.452
'War makes for strange alliances,

16:34.577 --> 16:36.246
'putting you into business
with people that,

16:36.371 --> 16:39.457
'under other circumstances,
you wouldn't even shake hands with.'

16:39.582 --> 16:41.376
Great machine.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.714
You people know how to build
a fucking assault chopper.

16:46.756 --> 16:50.552
'The same is true of your enemies.
They will unite when they need to.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.681
'FARC, or Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia,

16:54.806 --> 16:58.518
'were a guerrilla army
about 17,000 strong

16:58.643 --> 17:01.521
'engaged in the longest civil war
in modern history.

17:02.856 --> 17:07.527
'And in the early days of that war,
how did they finance their struggle?

17:07.652 --> 17:09.738
'Kidnapping.

17:09.863 --> 17:14.367
'Wealthy Colombians would pay a ransom
to have their loved ones returned unharmed.

17:14.492 --> 17:17.120
'So when the Cali cartel wanted

'safely hidden somewhere

17:19.789 --> 17:22.292
'they hired the pros.

17:22.417 --> 17:25.045
'For a hefty fee, of course.'

17:25.170 --> 17:29.007
Nice look, Berna.
You're coming on the raid?

17:29.132 --> 17:31.551
Thanks, but no.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.679
I'm coming to make sure
all goes well with our friends.

17:34.804 --> 17:36.347
Look at me.

17:36.473 --> 17:39.559
Do you think an important man
like me

17:39.684 --> 17:43.730
is going to risk his life
for some gringo piece of ass?

17:49.611 --> 17:51.613
You don't know how to take a joke.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.966
- I'll go in.
- Sure.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.011
But they go with you.

18:35.281 --> 18:39.911
What about you, brother?
Are you trying to fuck us all or what?

18:40.036 --> 18:44.165
- Calm down, Gilberto.
- 'Franklin Jurado's in U.S. custody.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.920
You don't want to surrender,
and you let them get the goddamn ledger!

18:49.045 --> 18:53.091
Since you were a kid, I had to tell you
what to do and what not to...

18:53.216 --> 18:57.137
You know what, Gilberto?
Since you were a kid, you had a big mouth.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.764
Why don't you just shut up?

19:01.015 --> 19:03.685
He's fucking lost his mind.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.062
All these acts of violence
in the North Valley

19:06.187 --> 19:08.273
are straining our friends' patience.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.568
Any surrender deal's
hanging by a thread.

19:11.693 --> 19:15.947
- Uncle Miguel has to see that.
- I told him, no violence.

19:17.282 --> 19:19.951
Is this all my fault?

19:20.076 --> 19:23.496
Haven't I always done
what was best for him?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.084
Franklin Jurado...

19:29.794 --> 19:33.006
I need to reach out to Chepe.
Or Pacho.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.049
But how the fuck...?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.927
There's no one else I can trust with this.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.221
Let's see...

19:42.807 --> 19:44.225
Dad...

19:54.652 --> 19:55.945
Nicolás...

19:57.947 --> 20:01.701
I need you to get involved
in the Jurado situation.

20:13.463 --> 20:14.756
Hello.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.508
Any news?

20:17.634 --> 20:20.053
He has a girlfriend
on the other side of town.

20:20.178 --> 20:24.933
Look, David, if Enrique was a rat,
he wouldn't be around anymore.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.685
Thanks.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.646
I think I'll wait here.

20:30.438 --> 20:33.983
You know he's a mama's boy.
That fucker will be back.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.904
So now what?

20:38.029 --> 20:41.449
Now you go to Toro Negro.
Navegante's waiting for you.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.118
He'll give you an assignment
from my father.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.413
Why didn't he call me?

20:49.082 --> 20:51.084
I'm going to explain something to you.

20:51.209 --> 20:55.713
Until this is figured out,
you only talk to me. Understood?

20:57.674 --> 20:59.425
Yes, sir.

20:59.550 --> 21:05.181
Better get moving.
Navegante hates to wait.

21:25.535 --> 21:29.914
'Coming up to coordinates
Kirk 5-7, manoeuvre incoming.'

21:30.039 --> 21:33.584
'Private militias not only
weren't illegal in Colombia,

21:33.710 --> 21:35.253
'they were encouraged.

21:35.378 --> 21:39.465
'A government program called
CONVIVIR was started in 1994.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.801
'And it authorised security forces

21:41.926 --> 21:45.346
'to take up arms
against the communist guerrillas.

21:45.471 --> 21:50.101
'A free pass for crimes against humanity,
sponsored by Uncle Sam.'

21:50.226 --> 21:52.770
Gentlemen,
so good to see you again.

21:52.895 --> 21:55.315
Third-generation night vision goggles.

21:55.440 --> 22:00.820
The same ones the Americans used
in Operation Desert Shield.

22:02.113 --> 22:07.452
Peña, can we keep them afterwards
as a contribution to the cause?

22:08.911 --> 22:12.498
'The Castaños ran
the largest private militia in Colombia.

22:12.623 --> 22:16.919
'Their AUC,

'Theirs was a perpetual war.

'And if you're hunting communist guerrillas
in the jungle, they were your only call.'

22:30.141 --> 22:33.019
This one has AFCS.

22:33.144 --> 22:36.481
- And the 701 engine.
- Hmm.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.819
- Not like last time.
- Last time?

22:41.944 --> 22:46.532
The CIA. They had us out here
hunting commies on Christmas day.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.410
- That's real dedication.
- It is God's work.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.497
Merry Christmas.

23:09.764 --> 23:12.600
'My dad trusts him,
but did you see him?'

23:12.725 --> 23:14.977
'That son of a bitch
looks nervous, right?'

23:15.103 --> 23:19.273
'Never stopped
adjusting the mirror, staring.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.193
'I kind of love how much

'I'm going to leave
those poor girls orphans.'

'Poor things.'
'You can adopt them.'

'This is Paola. Leave a message.'

24:07.822 --> 24:12.368
Hello, love, it's me. Paola, listen,
I need you to call me back.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.078
It's very important.

CONFIRM

24:42.899 --> 24:44.400
0 NEW MESSAGES

25:35.618 --> 25:38.538
Take me to where you stashed him,
Jorge Salcedo.

25:41.249 --> 25:43.376
Stashed who?

25:45.086 --> 25:46.295
Pallomari.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.425
Are we taking him someplace?

25:51.968 --> 25:53.302
Uh-huh.

25:55.429 --> 25:56.847
I see.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.069
What do you mean,
you're going to a meeting?

26:10.194 --> 26:12.613
I have a business to run, Guillermo.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.490
A meeting with who?

26:14.615 --> 26:17.660
With Fredy.
We're meeting a new client.

26:17.785 --> 26:22.748
Fredy? Patricia, the police almost
caught Miguel yesterday.

26:22.873 --> 26:26.752
- For fuck's sake!
- What's the problem?

26:26.877 --> 26:28.963
You didn't tell them where he was,
did you?

26:29.088 --> 26:31.382
- No.
- No. What are you worried about?

26:31.507 --> 26:34.468
Miguel likes you.
That's what you always tell me.

26:34.594 --> 26:39.181
- Yes, but always within limits.
- You're worrying too much, Guillermo.

26:39.307 --> 26:42.893
They need you. You're the brains
behind the organisation...

26:43.019 --> 26:48.733
None of that matters, Patricia, none,
if they decide not to leave loose ends.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.569
You're giving me a headache.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.157
Listen to me.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.910
My love, we have to get out of here
before it's too late.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.717
It's just a couple hours.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.764
Call me if there's a problem.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.411
What is it, Jorge Salcedo?

27:44.664 --> 27:48.250
What do we do if we find
Pallomari's family in the apartment?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.338
Hope that we don't.

27:55.341 --> 27:59.345
We'll need to be quick.
I have someplace to be.

28:01.889 --> 28:07.561
The love of my life is in town
and we have a date.

28:10.648 --> 28:14.360
That's great.
When was the last time you saw her?

28:14.485 --> 28:16.278
Eight years.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.824
Eight long years.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.661
Why so long since last time
you saw her?

28:23.786 --> 28:27.581
You know, she was abroad.

28:28.290 --> 28:30.751
- In Japan.
- Japan?

28:32.169 --> 28:33.838
Working?

28:35.172 --> 28:37.883
She fucked a police captain.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.011
Then she tried to turn me in.

28:41.137 --> 28:44.598
All these years, I've been hanging
around her parents' house

28:44.724 --> 28:47.017
waiting for her to come back.

28:47.143 --> 28:52.940
People say things happen for a reason.
All I know is... she came back.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.692
She came back.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.949
Beautiful day. Right?

29:05.202 --> 29:09.999
- How many tents, give or take?
- I think around 20.

29:10.124 --> 29:14.170
The FARC arrange themselves
in staggered positions, two circles.

29:14.295 --> 29:19.175
Then they always go for lookouts
in high places along the trails.

29:19.300 --> 29:21.302
Sun sets in three hours.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.388
As soon as they hear the chopper,
they're going to hide.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.225
Generators, flashlights, fires...
everything.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.936
Those rats have a lot of practice hiding.

29:31.061 --> 29:35.357
Once the lights go, they'll use
guidelines strung into the jungle.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.944
They grab hold, follow ropes to safety.

29:39.069 --> 29:44.283
Once we find one of those ropes...

29:47.828 --> 29:49.830
It's a fucking slaughter.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.665
Berna...

30:09.308 --> 30:12.353
Look, I don't want a bloodbath.

30:13.562 --> 30:15.689
Listen to me, Peña.

30:15.815 --> 30:19.944
You want the girl...
there will be a body count.

30:20.069 --> 30:22.738
This is a war zone.

30:22.863 --> 30:26.826
But if you want,
we can still call this thing off.

30:30.704 --> 30:33.582
I need to get her back.

30:35.042 --> 30:37.002
Just to be clear...

30:38.420 --> 30:44.844
...something goes wrong,
you still keep your promise.

31:06.949 --> 31:12.454
Hey, you talk to Pallomari,
try to keep him calm.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.999
- Then I come in.
- Okay.

31:20.754 --> 31:22.631
Pallomari?

31:24.717 --> 31:26.176
Pallomari!

31:57.333 --> 31:59.960
He's not here, of course.

32:03.589 --> 32:05.341
No luggage.

32:06.926 --> 32:10.512
Must've freaked out
when Miguel almost got caught.

32:11.597 --> 32:15.392
You know, Pallomari,
he's the smart one.

32:15.517 --> 32:19.396
Guess that's why
he's the accountant.

32:19.521 --> 32:21.565
And not a thug.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.362
Hey, Salcedo...

32:27.613 --> 32:29.281
You'll need to find him.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.951
Miguel gave this priority.
Do you understand?

32:32.076 --> 32:35.996
- I'll take care of it.
- Let me know when you have him.

32:38.916 --> 32:41.835
I need tonight
for the business I told you about.

32:43.754 --> 32:44.922
Sure.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.094
Good luck, then.

33:12.157 --> 33:15.577
- 'Hey, it's me.'
- Salcedo! Busy today.

33:15.703 --> 33:19.039
Listen... any chatter from Pallomari?

33:19.164 --> 33:22.209
None I've heard.
But we got him.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.338
- Who?
- 'Enrique.'

33:27.297 --> 33:32.177
He called his brother, the idiot.
David's on his way to get him.

33:33.846 --> 33:37.599
That's great news.
Miguel must be pleased.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.714
- David?
- 'We have him.'

34:10.090 --> 34:11.383
Yes?

34:12.426 --> 34:14.344
'He showed up at the house?'

34:14.470 --> 34:17.556
Meet us at 11th & 614th.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.653
You ever hear anything
from Judy?

34:31.779 --> 34:34.156
Not since you sold her out.

34:34.281 --> 34:37.284
Who'd have thought it, Javier?
Both of us, bosses.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.953
They give you a nice place in Bogotá?

34:41.538 --> 34:44.041
- It's good.
- You should see my house.

34:44.166 --> 34:49.213
I can take a shit in a different bathroom
every day of the week. My wife loves it.

34:50.047 --> 34:51.465
Your wife?

34:53.133 --> 34:54.968
I'm a family man.

34:56.178 --> 34:59.306
Bet you still live out of a suitcase.

35:01.058 --> 35:06.939
Guess catching guys like me
makes it all worth it. Right?

35:16.031 --> 35:18.450
Don't forget the suitcase.

35:18.575 --> 35:20.160
Keep going!

35:20.285 --> 35:23.330
Come on. Let's go!
Assume position!

35:36.385 --> 35:40.013
'Be advised, team:
five minutes to LZ.'

37:01.011 --> 37:03.388
Let's see how our new toys work.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.854
Get ready.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.525
God bless America.

37:49.810 --> 37:51.520
Our guest of honour's arrived.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.401
What's going on here?

38:01.488 --> 38:05.117
Jorge, you're going to have
to explain some things.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.883
Alpha in position.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.428
Tell him what you told us.

38:26.596 --> 38:29.808
- Huh?
- Salcedo knew about the DEA.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.021
You're going to talk to me
like a man, motherfucker.

38:34.146 --> 38:38.483
Salcedo works with the DEA!
He knew the DEA was in Cali.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.405
He knew where they were at,
and he told me to watch them.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.575
And he told me not to tell you.

38:52.789 --> 38:55.083
'Charlie in position.'

38:59.046 --> 39:00.589
Bravo in position.

39:00.714 --> 39:04.676
Everyone's in position.
Rotor, force them to the north.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.762
'Copy that.
We're going to push them out.

39:06.887 --> 39:09.681
'We're circling back.
Arriving in 30 seconds.'

39:11.433 --> 39:14.978
Is that true, Jorge? Tell me.

39:15.103 --> 39:19.191
Tell me.
Are you working with the DEA?

39:20.525 --> 39:23.862
Sir... it's true that I've been
successfully tracking the DEA.

39:23.987 --> 39:27.866
But saying that I knew where
their safe house is, that's absurd.

39:27.991 --> 39:32.371
'Rotor ETA five seconds.
We have visual.'

39:40.587 --> 39:44.257
'FARC is on the move.
They're going dark.'

39:45.884 --> 39:50.180
'Peña, they have your girlfriend
in the southeast part of camp.'

39:56.228 --> 39:57.562
Let's move.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.399
They're about to kill me
because of you, motherfucker!

40:00.524 --> 40:03.485
That fucking son of a bitch is lying!

40:03.610 --> 40:06.655
If you're looking for an infiltrator,
it's him, not me.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.992
Shut up! Know what they're gonna do
to my family if you say that shit?

40:11.118 --> 40:12.452
You son of a bitch!

40:12.577 --> 40:14.704
Let go of me!
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

40:14.830 --> 40:17.916
- Let it go, motherfucker!
- Sir, that bastard is lying!

40:18.041 --> 40:20.752
What do you want me to say
if that's the truth, motherfucker?

40:20.877 --> 40:22.170
Cut the bullshit!

40:27.217 --> 40:30.011
'All right, men,
let's get these fireworks started.'

40:30.137 --> 40:33.849
'And don't be pussies.
This is easy. Get ready.

40:33.974 --> 40:36.893
'This shit is on!'

40:40.522 --> 40:42.649
I'm tired of this, Dad.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.568
Sir, no.

40:44.693 --> 40:47.362
David, please. What is this?

40:48.363 --> 40:50.991
- Sir, I have no idea...
- Dad...

40:59.499 --> 41:01.626
What the fuck's that?

41:08.675 --> 41:10.844
What the fuck is that?

41:11.803 --> 41:14.973
Huh? Is that you, motherfucker?
Huh?

41:15.098 --> 41:17.350
- No.
- What the fuck is that?

41:23.648 --> 41:26.401
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know, sir. I've never seen that!

41:27.277 --> 41:29.905
Sir, I swear
I've never seen that before.

41:31.323 --> 41:35.285
'Let's give those fucking
guerrillas a rain of bullets!'

41:35.410 --> 41:38.413
'They're in the river!
Give them lead!'

41:38.538 --> 41:41.958
Sir... it's a SkyPager.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.461
It's American high-end tech.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.922
- Don Miguel, please!
- Shut up.

41:47.047 --> 41:49.216
- What the fuck does it say?
- Let's see.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.177
These are messages in English.
He's your rat!

41:52.302 --> 41:55.639
Motherfucker, you're going to have
my family killed dragging me into this!

41:56.848 --> 41:59.142
It's not yours?
It's not yours, Enrique?

41:59.267 --> 42:02.062
- Sir, I swear I've never seen that before.
- Shh!

42:02.187 --> 42:05.315
I swear on my mother
I've never seen that before, Don Miguel!

42:05.440 --> 42:08.568
- Can they track us with this shit?
- I think so, sir.

42:08.693 --> 42:09.861
Motherfucker!

42:12.405 --> 42:13.490
- No.
- Don't move.

42:13.615 --> 42:18.286
- Please! Don Miguel, no!
- Don't move.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.579
No! Let me go!

42:21.289 --> 42:24.125
Tell the truth, motherfucker!

42:24.626 --> 42:26.336
Salcedo, you motherfucker!

42:26.461 --> 42:28.505
Ah! Don Miguel!

42:35.303 --> 42:38.181
Look, Jorge. Your friend.

42:41.351 --> 42:43.645
- Christina...
- Don't. Don't.

42:44.312 --> 42:46.606
Stay where you are.
Put the gun down!

42:47.190 --> 42:48.984
Don't move.

42:49.109 --> 42:50.902
- Stay still.
- Please.

42:51.027 --> 42:53.154
One more step and I'll...

43:09.921 --> 43:11.756
The rat is dead.

43:19.598 --> 43:23.268
What's wrong? Start!

43:27.731 --> 43:29.232
Feistl.

43:29.357 --> 43:32.193
I have her. Get Franklin ready.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.856
Okay? You're going home.

44:10.649 --> 44:13.735
You're going home. Okay?

44:32.796 --> 44:35.131
Yes, I know my signature.

44:37.634 --> 44:38.885
- Hi!
- Hi, Dad!

44:39.010 --> 44:40.929
Where's Mum?

44:41.054 --> 44:44.265
Jorge?
She doesn't want to see you.

44:45.016 --> 44:46.226
Paola!

44:47.227 --> 44:49.771
Paola! Paola!

44:49.896 --> 44:53.108
Have some respect.
This is my mother's house!

44:55.944 --> 44:57.779
What's going on?

45:00.907 --> 45:02.701
What is it?

45:05.495 --> 45:07.247
What's going on?

45:08.331 --> 45:09.958
Breathe.

45:14.087 --> 45:15.588
What happened?

45:16.464 --> 45:19.175
What's going on? Come here.

45:47.287 --> 45:49.581
In less than an hour,
we're on that plane.

45:53.209 --> 45:54.919
Your husband knows.

45:56.421 --> 45:58.548
He'll be waiting for you.

46:02.677 --> 46:05.138
It's all behind you now, Christina.

46:08.850 --> 46:12.604
And you think
I should thank you for that?

46:14.814 --> 46:16.065
No.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.068
No, I don't.

46:20.987 --> 46:24.657
No, you think you're a hero
because you, what,

46:24.783 --> 46:27.869
executed a bunch of farmers
to get me out

46:27.994 --> 46:30.580
so that my husband
would testify for you?

46:32.207 --> 46:35.877
I did what I had to do
and I'm sorry for what happened to you.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.549
No.

46:42.926 --> 46:45.929
No, you're not.
And you know it.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.391
You're a piece of shit.

47:37.605 --> 47:39.732
- Salcedo?
- 'I know where Miguel is.'

47:39.858 --> 47:43.653
- This needs to happen right now.
- 'Yeah, of course.'

47:43.778 --> 47:46.614
'Your code name for me? Natalia?'

47:46.739 --> 47:49.784
- What about it?
- 'They know. You have a leak.

47:49.909 --> 47:51.995
'The cartel knows about it.

47:52.120 --> 47:54.455
'It won't be long before
they know about me.'

47:54.581 --> 47:58.501
This needs to happen now
or I'm dead.

48:10.805 --> 48:13.349
Call for you. Number four.

48:16.561 --> 48:17.812
Hello?

48:19.063 --> 48:20.607
Hello?

48:21.441 --> 48:23.484
- Hello?
- Brother...

48:25.069 --> 48:29.616
That phone doesn't work.
Try number five.

48:38.625 --> 48:40.209
You're Colombian.

48:41.377 --> 48:42.795
Right?

48:43.880 --> 48:46.257
I'm from Cali.

49:05.234 --> 49:07.904
Hello? Hello?

49:22.919 --> 49:24.170
Yeah?

49:24.295 --> 49:27.382
'Hey, it's been taken care of.'

49:41.938 --> 49:43.147
Yeah?

49:44.190 --> 49:47.026
Yeah, we're about to get on the plane.
We'll be in Miami...

49:54.075 --> 49:55.493
When?

50:04.877 --> 50:06.963
Let me call you back.
