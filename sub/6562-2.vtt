02:36.457 --> 02:37.825

- YOU TOLD JENNY
TO COME OUT TO L.A.,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.395
AND WE'LL HELP HER MAKE
HER DREAMS COME TRUE?

02:41.429 --> 02:43.497
- NOT IN THOSE EXACT WORDS.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.733
- "JENNY, COME OUT TO L.A.,
AND WE'LL HELP MAKE

02:45.766 --> 02:46.834
YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE."

02:46.867 --> 02:48.802
- I DIDN'T THINK
SHE WOULD DO IT.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.404
- YOU WROTE DOWN
THE AIRLINE SCHEDULE

02:50.438 --> 02:52.873
AND TURN-BY-TURN DIRECTIONS
TO ROCQUE RECORDS.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.475

02:54.508 --> 02:58.679
- "P.S., WE PROMISE
WE'LL HELP YOU."

02:58.712 --> 03:00.848

WE LOVE JENNY.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.388
PLUS, SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
OUR BIGGEST FAN.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.857

03:10.858 --> 03:12.560
- YES, BUT IT'S JENNY.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.763
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

03:21.302 --> 03:22.370
I'M GONNA TELL THE GIRL

03:22.403 --> 03:23.971

03:25.806 --> 03:27.341
DON'T WANT TO HELP HER,

03:27.375 --> 03:31.211
AND THAT SHE HAS TO GO BACK
TO MINNESOTA.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.249
- STOP!

03:35.283 --> 03:37.951
WE ARE A TEAM.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.687
SO IF CARLOS TOTALLY MESSES UP

03:39.720 --> 03:42.656
AND PROMISED WE'D HELP HER,
THEN WE GOT TO HELP HER.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.657

*

03:51.865 --> 03:52.933
- EASY, JENNY, EASY.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.503
- PUT IT DOWN.
PUT IT DOWN.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.772
- WOW, YOU DO NOT HEAR TROMBONE
PLAYING LIKE THAT EVERY DAY.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.040

04:15.856 --> 04:17.391
- SORRY.

04:17.425 --> 04:18.592
PEOPLE SAY I'M A LITTLE
ACCIDENT PRONE.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.828
- GET THIS OUT OF HERE
BEFORE IT DESTROYS

04:20.861 --> 04:21.829
THE REST OF MY STUDIO!

04:21.862 --> 04:23.030
- JENNY, COME ON.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.532
LET'S GO MAKE YOUR DREAMS

04:28.436 --> 04:29.403
[all screaming]

04:29.437 --> 04:31.572

04:48.489 --> 04:50.624
- YEAH, AND REMEMBER
THE SECOND GRADE

04:50.658 --> 04:53.026
WHEN SHE BROKE MY ARM
PLAYING MARBLES?

04:53.060 --> 04:54.662
OR THE FIFTH GRADE
WHEN SHE GAVE ME

04:54.695 --> 04:57.765
THE FIRST PAPER CUT IN HISTORY
THAT REQUIRED SURGERY,

04:57.798 --> 05:00.033
AND THEN, EIGHTH GRADE...

05:00.067 --> 05:02.002
LAB PARTNERS.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.937
- IT TOOK ALMOST A YEAR
FOR YOUR HAIR TO GROW BACK.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.373

[all shouting]

05:17.485 --> 05:18.486

05:18.519 --> 05:19.553
PUT THAT THING DOWN.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.788
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, BITTERS.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.424

[wind whistling]

05:26.627 --> 05:28.429
OH, COME ON!

05:28.462 --> 05:29.463
- GREAT NEWS!

05:29.497 --> 05:30.498
THE SUPER IS ON STRIKE,

05:30.531 --> 05:33.434
BUT HE SAID THAT TROMBONE GIRL'S
THERMOSTAT FINALE

05:33.467 --> 05:35.503
PROBABLY SHORTED THE FANS.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.572
- WHAT IS THIS?
- IT'S A WRENCH,

05:38.606 --> 05:39.573
AND THE MANUAL.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.974
WE HAVE TO FIX IT OURSELVES.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.643
- YEAH, I DON'T DO WRENCH.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.547
- HEY, THIS WHISTLING
IS DRIVING ME CRAZY!

05:49.517 --> 05:50.484
- WHO ARE YOU?

05:50.518 --> 05:53.387
- DEATH SMASH.

05:53.421 --> 05:56.624
THE WORLD'S
MOST DESTRUCTIVE BAND.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.859
WHEN WE RENTED OUT
THE REHEARSAL SPACE,

05:58.892 --> 06:01.529
WE DIDN'T REQUEST AN IDIOT
IN A TRACK SUIT

06:01.562 --> 06:03.431
AND WHISTLE NOISES.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.532
- HUH?

06:04.565 --> 06:07.501
- YOU TOLD ME TO MAKE MORE MONEY
FOR THE STUDIO, SO--

06:07.535 --> 06:10.103
- IF YOU DON'T FIX THE FAN
RIGHT QUICK,

06:10.137 --> 06:12.706
WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW DESTRUCTIVE WE CAN GET.

06:14.542 --> 06:17.578
[smashing and crashing]

06:17.611 --> 06:19.847
- AND FIX IT WE CAN!

06:19.880 --> 06:21.615
WHISTLE BE GONE SOON THERE,
MATES.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.651
WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW
TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

06:23.684 --> 06:28.055
[whistling continues]

06:28.088 --> 06:30.524
WHAT IS THIS THING CALLED AGAIN?

06:32.660 --> 06:35.596
- WHOA, YOU'RE JAMES DIAMOND
FROM BIG TIME RUSH.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.531
I'M YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.532
- [laughs]

06:38.566 --> 06:39.800
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.470
MANY OF MY FANS
ARE WELL OVER FIVE FEET.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.871
- CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

06:45.706 --> 06:48.576
- WOULD YOU LIKE
FUTURISTIC POSTMAN

06:48.609 --> 06:51.679
OR OVEREAGER HABERDASHER?

06:51.712 --> 06:54.782

IF YOU COULD SIGN THIS?

06:54.815 --> 06:56.517

07:01.655 --> 07:02.790
- JAMES, CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME

07:02.823 --> 07:04.725
HOW YOU GOT TO BE
SO AWESOME?

07:04.758 --> 07:07.928
- WELL, I WAS TOLD NOT
TO GIVE FANS ADVICE.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.463
BUT I LIKE YOUR STYLE.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.500
AWESOMENESS IS 15% TAN,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.602
40% GOOD ATTITUDE,
20% BAD ATTITUDE,

07:14.635 --> 07:17.638
AND 50% IMPORTED
HAIR CARE PRODUCTS.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.507
- THAT'S 125%.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.574
- YOU BET IT IS.

07:20.608 --> 07:23.243
- I WOULD LOVE TO BE
JUST LIKE YOU.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.779
- WHAT DO YOU SAY YOU GO GET US
SOME LOW-FAT SOY SHAKES,

07:25.813 --> 07:28.816
AND I GIVE YOU MORE TIPS
ON BEING AWESOME?

07:28.849 --> 07:30.751
- YOU GOT IT, MR. DIAMOND.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.489
- BE CAREFUL OF FANS.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.157
IT COMES FROM
THE WORD "FANATIC,"

07:37.190 --> 07:38.759
AS IN, "NUT JOB."

07:38.792 --> 07:39.927
- I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.495
YOU HAVE A HUGE CRUSH ON ME,

07:41.529 --> 07:42.496
AND YOU'RE JEALOUS

07:42.530 --> 07:44.565
OF MY NEW BIGGEST FAN.

07:44.598 --> 07:45.499
- I DON'T HAVE A CRUSH ON YOU.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.267
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT YOU'RE 30% IGNORANT,

07:47.300 --> 07:49.570
30% ARROGANT,

07:49.603 --> 07:50.571
AND 40% IDIOT.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.506
SO BE CAREFUL OF FANS.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.710
- SHE SO HAS
A GIANT CRUSH ON ME.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.246
- OKAY, SO JENNY'S DREAM

07:59.279 --> 08:00.814
IS TO BECOME A LEAD SINGER
OF A BAND.

08:00.848 --> 08:04.051
- AND L.A .IS FULL OF BANDS
LOOKING FOR LEAD SINGERS.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.053
- YEAH, THERE'S JUST
ONE PROBLEM.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.721
SHE CAN'T SING!

08:07.755 --> 08:09.590
DO YOU REMEMBER FRESHMEN CHOIR?

08:09.623 --> 08:13.293
- * AND BIRDS WILL FLY!

08:13.326 --> 08:16.930
crash!

08:16.964 --> 08:18.298
- RIGHT, SO JUST NEED TO FIND

08:18.331 --> 08:20.734
A BAND WHO'S LOOKING
FOR A HORRIBLE SINGER,

08:20.768 --> 08:22.202
WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SENT
FROM VOLTRAZ

08:22.235 --> 08:23.203
TO DESTROY THE EARTH.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.204
crash!

08:24.237 --> 08:27.608
- WHOA!

08:27.641 --> 08:29.943
- THAT ALWAYS HAPPENS
WHEN I MAKE TOAST.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.044
CAN I MAKE YOU SOME?

08:31.078 --> 08:32.212
- WE'RE GOOD.
- WE'RE FINE.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.548
- IT'S SO EXCITING
BEING IN L.A.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.649
AND BEING NEIGHBORS.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.984
AW.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.919
OH, AND NOW WE HAVE
CONNECTING ROOMS!

08:39.987 --> 08:43.223
[sighs]

08:43.256 --> 08:44.257
- SHE'S GONNA KILL US!

08:44.291 --> 08:46.159
- NOT IF WE KILL HER FIRST.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.795
- NOBODY IS KILLING ANYONE.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.196
WE CAN DO THIS.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.632
WE NEVER BREAK A PROMISE.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.833
SO STOP PROMISING STUFF!

08:52.866 --> 08:54.234
- GET RID OF IT.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.569
YOUR FRIEND HAS BEEN

08:55.603 --> 08:57.871
FOR TWO HOURS,
AND SO FAR

08:57.905 --> 08:59.740

08:59.773 --> 09:01.341
BROKEN A WATER MAIN,
RUINED MY FAVORITE PEN,

09:01.374 --> 09:03.677
AND STARTED TWO FIRES.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.678
- WHAT?
