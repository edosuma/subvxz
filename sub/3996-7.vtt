00:11.582 --> 00:12.916
So scrummy.

00:12.984 --> 00:14.818
I'm good with this.
Looks like you're soloing

00:14.886 --> 00:16.787
on $80 worth of sushi, Schmidt.

00:16.855 --> 00:18.122

to climb aboard, man.

You got a serious
J-O-B now.

00:23.527 --> 00:24.827

- Yeah.

Dude, it's a temp job.

00:26.397 --> 00:27.530

01:40.033 --> 01:41.165
I should have told you,

01:41.233 --> 01:42.500
but the community center decided

01:42.501 --> 01:45.069
to turn our rehearsal space
back into a hallway, so...

01:45.137 --> 01:46.471
I had nowhere to go.

Is this something that
a mean, creative judge

01:48.474 --> 01:50.308
- made you do?
- Yeah, this is just like

01:50.376 --> 01:52.009
a nightmare I had where
you brought over

01:52.077 --> 01:53.478
teenagers with bells.

01:53.546 --> 01:54.879
These kids had a choice

01:54.947 --> 01:57.047
between early morning
detention and music,

01:57.114 --> 01:58.749
and they all chose music.

01:58.817 --> 02:00.050
No kidding?

02:00.117 --> 02:01.885
Desiree, bells are
not for hitting.

02:01.953 --> 02:03.554
The kids wanted to
play band instruments,

02:03.621 --> 02:06.156
but we got a huge
donation of handbells,

02:06.224 --> 02:08.058
- which are tres tres dope.
- Miss Day,

02:08.125 --> 02:10.193
can I eat some of
these crackers up in here?

02:10.261 --> 02:12.662
No, no, no. Water crackers

02:12.730 --> 02:15.698
are for adults...
to eat with adult cheese.

02:15.766 --> 02:17.633
Can I eat
a cracker sushi sandwich?

02:17.701 --> 02:19.268
- No. Jess.
- So what, you guys

02:19.336 --> 02:21.671
are gonna sit around all night
playing "Jingle Bells"?

02:21.739 --> 02:23.138
"Jingle Bells" is a trash song

02:23.206 --> 02:24.574
played on a trash instrument,

02:24.641 --> 02:26.008
and I'm not really
asking permission,

02:26.076 --> 02:29.544

02:29.612 --> 02:31.713
Well, that got serious.

02:31.781 --> 02:34.716
Anyway, you are gonna
love these kids.

02:41.223 --> 02:43.024

Great, guys!

to choose detention?

02:52.834 --> 02:54.234

02:54.302 --> 02:55.870
We don't suck, we just need

How much did he pay for this?

08:09.233 --> 08:10.567
All right, you know what?
That's enough.

08:10.635 --> 08:12.168
- $50? $100?
- Inappropriate.

08:12.236 --> 08:13.669
Hey, my name's Schmidt.
I was born rich.

08:13.737 --> 08:16.038

- Okay.

gift my nanny gave me

"Eye of the Tiger" is
the greatest song ever written.

it ended the Cold War.

he can score.

conditioner, right?

15:32.638 --> 15:33.872

17:12.867 --> 17:15.237
I'm sorry, Jess,
but I really don't care.

17:15.305 --> 17:16.871
You know what,
I love running this group.

17:16.939 --> 17:18.039
It gives me

17:18.108 --> 17:19.708
confidence, it gives me

17:19.775 --> 17:21.210
muscle definition.

17:21.277 --> 17:22.611
Yes, sometimes it gives me

17:22.678 --> 17:24.378
blinding optical migraines

17:24.446 --> 17:27.147
where I literally can't see
three feet in front of myself.

17:27.215 --> 17:29.350
But I love these kids.

17:29.418 --> 17:31.785
And I'm sorry I kicked you
out of group,

17:31.853 --> 17:35.323
but one thing you can't do with
these kids is make it about you.

17:35.390 --> 17:37.458
Jess, I don't see
what the big deal is, okay?

17:37.526 --> 17:39.393
I only practiced with you guys
a couple of times.

17:39.461 --> 17:41.028
You're such a tonkel!

17:41.096 --> 17:42.162
Whoa, hold it!

17:42.230 --> 17:43.830
Don't nobody call me a tonkel.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.332
If you tell them
they aren't good,

17:45.399 --> 17:46.533
that's one more person
telling them that.

17:46.601 --> 17:47.967
That's a big deal to me,

17:48.035 --> 17:49.736

gives up on them.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.438

17:54.542 --> 17:56.876

I want friends
who still lie to me,

18:24.203 --> 18:25.637
'cause they don't want
to hurt my feelings.

18:25.704 --> 18:26.771
Mm.

18:26.838 --> 18:28.306
I sadly kind of mean that.

18:30.441 --> 18:31.708
What happened to us, man?

18:31.776 --> 18:33.877
We used to be so cool.

18:33.944 --> 18:36.880
I was going to play basketball
and be a gazillionaire.

18:36.947 --> 18:38.282
Right. And I told myself

18:38.349 --> 18:39.883
I was never going to live
with Schmidt.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.186
- Who do you live with now?
- I live with Schmidt,

18:42.253 --> 18:43.953
and he's killing me, Winston,
he's killing me.

18:47.558 --> 18:49.725
I got fired from a temp job.

18:49.793 --> 18:51.527
Yeah, I got kicked out

18:51.595 --> 18:53.896
of bell group
for being too mean to kids.

18:53.963 --> 18:55.864
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

18:55.932 --> 18:58.000
That's a low point.
You ain't got to talk to me, I know it.

18:58.068 --> 18:59.101
I know it, man.

18:59.169 --> 19:01.070
But I was just enjoying

19:01.137 --> 19:02.804
- being good at something.
- Yeah.

19:02.871 --> 19:04.072
I mean, what does
she want me to do,

19:04.139 --> 19:05.574
not care about
what the songs sound like?

19:05.641 --> 19:07.442
Winston, this is
your thing though.

19:07.510 --> 19:10.412
It's not always about
being the best.

19:10.479 --> 19:13.981
It's not always
about you, Winston.

19:14.049 --> 19:15.750
This is about kids.

19:15.818 --> 19:17.018
Just pass the ball.

19:32.066 --> 19:33.467
I'll drive, pal.

19:33.535 --> 19:34.800
Hey.

19:34.868 --> 19:36.536
Want to go to
this bells concert?

19:39.373 --> 19:40.940
Let me get my cardigan.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.481
I know you guys are nervous.

19:48.549 --> 19:50.716
I know you want to do
a really great job

19:50.783 --> 19:53.418
and you want to sound really
great, but it's not about that.

19:53.486 --> 19:55.787
There's a really big crowd
of people who's really excited

19:55.855 --> 19:57.422
and wants to hear
some bells today.

19:57.490 --> 19:58.323
Just look.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.228
All right, bring it in.

20:07.899 --> 20:10.000
Hello, Pershing Park!

20:10.068 --> 20:11.168
We are...

20:11.236 --> 20:13.103
Ensembell.

20:13.171 --> 20:14.071
What? What'd you say?

20:14.139 --> 20:15.205
I said, um, Ensembell.

20:15.274 --> 20:17.074
She said Ensembell!

20:17.142 --> 20:18.509
It's on the banner, stupid!

20:24.081 --> 20:25.448
You guys gonna
play something?

20:28.519 --> 20:31.887
But first, I'd like to welcome

20:31.954 --> 20:33.789
Winston Bishop to the stage.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.894
Hey, what's a Winston Bishop?

20:40.430 --> 20:41.397
Hey.

20:42.599 --> 20:45.768
What's up?

20:45.835 --> 20:46.901
"Eye the Tiger"?

20:46.968 --> 20:48.536
Yo, Hector, you think

20:48.604 --> 20:50.171
- we can pull this off?
- Probably not.

20:50.238 --> 20:51.773
Yeah, I don't think so, either.

20:51.840 --> 20:52.873
So let's do it.

20:55.277 --> 20:57.412
One, two, three, four.

21:00.549 --> 21:02.016
Two, three, four.

21:05.286 --> 21:07.120
You know I don't think
you're a loser, right?

21:07.188 --> 21:08.422
I can't hear anything you say

21:08.489 --> 21:10.023
when you wear
that sweater, Schmidt.

21:10.090 --> 21:12.459
You open your mouth and I just
hear: "Cardigan, cardigan.

21:12.527 --> 21:13.827
I am wearing a cardigan."

21:15.830 --> 21:17.230
This is super embarrassing.

21:17.298 --> 21:18.397
Yeah, it's terrible.

21:22.268 --> 21:25.671
♪ It's the eye of the tiger,
it's the thrill of the fight ♪

21:25.739 --> 21:27.973
♪ Rising, watching us all
with the eye... ♪

21:28.541 --> 21:30.108
- You don't like the cardy?
- No.
