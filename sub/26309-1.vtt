[♪♪♪]

02:10.234 --> 02:11.566
LUCAS?

02:12.969 --> 02:14.068
[GASPING]

02:30.720 --> 02:31.919
[JENN]:
IT COULDN'T BE...

02:31.988 --> 02:33.755
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
AT FIRST.

02:33.790 --> 02:36.924
WELL, IF THIS IS
REALLY EDGAR ALLAN POE,

02:36.960 --> 02:39.427
WELL, THIS IS WORTH...
GOSH, I DON'T KNOW...

02:39.463 --> 02:40.895
LIKE, A HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS?

02:40.930 --> 02:42.830
OH, WELL, NO,
MORE LIKE FIFTY,

02:42.866 --> 02:44.533
BUT THE RARITY
OF A DAGUERREOTYPE...

02:44.568 --> 02:45.534
[DIRECTOR]:
CUT.

02:45.602 --> 02:47.235
WAS THAT OKAY,
MS. EPHRON?

02:47.271 --> 02:48.370
DID I MESS UP?

02:48.405 --> 02:49.837
YOU WERE GREAT.

02:49.873 --> 02:51.806
YOU BOTH WERE,
BUT JENN...

02:51.841 --> 02:54.342
WE NEED THIS PORTRAIT EVALUATED
AT A BIGGER NUMBER,

02:54.378 --> 02:56.311
LIKE THE HUNDRED THOUSAND
WE TALKED ABOUT.

02:56.346 --> 02:58.980
YES, BUT EVEN
IF THIS PIECE WERE REAL,

02:59.049 --> 03:01.650
IT WOULD ONLY BE WORTH
BETWEEN 30 AND 50.

03:01.685 --> 03:03.418
[DIRECTOR]: YOU KNOW,
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE REAL.

03:03.453 --> 03:04.752
THIS IS TV.

03:04.788 --> 03:05.753
I'M JUST NOT SURE
I'M COMFORTABLE

03:05.789 --> 03:07.489
LYING ABOUT A LIE.

03:07.524 --> 03:08.456
IT'S NOT A LIE.

03:08.492 --> 03:09.757
IT'S A STORY.

03:09.793 --> 03:10.892
WE'RE TELLING A STORY.

03:12.196 --> 03:14.128
BUT ISN'T THIS REALITY TV?

03:14.164 --> 03:15.397
OKAY, JUST...

03:15.432 --> 03:18.366
THINK OF IT AS
ENABLING THE PLOT.

03:18.402 --> 03:20.001
[WATCH BEEPING]

03:20.036 --> 03:22.204
I MEAN, ONLY IF YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

03:22.239 --> 03:24.472
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO NOT ACT NATURAL...

03:24.508 --> 03:26.274
THANK YOU.

03:26.310 --> 03:27.642
BUT... BUT
A HUNDRED THOUSAND?

03:27.711 --> 03:29.744
THAT'S A LOT
MORE EXCITING.

03:31.515 --> 03:32.780
ONLY HALF OF WHAT I'M GOING
TO OWE THE BANK

03:32.816 --> 03:33.781
IF THIS DOESN'T GET PICKED UP.

03:35.485 --> 03:37.352
[DIRECTOR]:
THE PILOT EPISODE

03:37.421 --> 03:39.554
REALLY NEEDS AS MUCH EXCITEMENT
AS WE CAN PACK IN.

03:39.590 --> 03:40.655
OKAY?

03:42.526 --> 03:44.058
WHY DID I LET YOU TALK ME
INTO THIS AGAIN?

03:44.094 --> 03:46.127
MM, 'CAUSE I LOVE
REALITY TV,

03:46.162 --> 03:47.662
AND YOU LOVE ME?

03:47.698 --> 03:49.364
I DO.

03:49.433 --> 03:50.565
AND THE EXTRA MONEY
WILL BE GOOD

03:50.601 --> 03:52.066
FOR RENOVATIONS
FOR THE STORE.

03:52.102 --> 03:53.835
-OKAY... OKAY.
-OKAY.

03:53.870 --> 03:54.769
LET'S GO AGAIN.

03:54.804 --> 03:55.704
YOU'RE GREAT.

03:55.739 --> 03:57.205
THINK BIG!

03:57.241 --> 03:58.340
GOTCHA. BIG.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.474
ROLL SOUND.

03:59.509 --> 04:00.275
[CREW]: SOUND SPEED.

04:00.310 --> 04:01.776
AND ACTION.

04:01.811 --> 04:02.777
[GASPING]

04:02.846 --> 04:04.145
IT COULDN'T BE...

04:04.180 --> 04:05.447
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AT FIRST.

04:05.482 --> 04:08.250
IF THIS IS A REAL
EDGAR ALLAN POE,

04:08.285 --> 04:09.384
WELL, THEN...

04:09.419 --> 04:11.586
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW MUCH THIS IS WORTH...

04:11.622 --> 04:13.521
LIKE, A HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS?

04:13.557 --> 04:16.625
[JENN]: MAYBE, YEAH...

04:16.660 --> 04:17.825
BUT THE RARITY
OF A DAGUERREOTYPE

04:17.894 --> 04:19.461
IN THIS CONDITION...

04:19.529 --> 04:20.695
WELL, THAT IS...

04:22.699 --> 04:25.099
PRICELESS.

04:25.135 --> 04:26.735
IT'S PRICELESS.

04:32.208 --> 04:33.207
[STARTING ENGINE]

04:33.277 --> 04:34.776
HEY.

04:34.811 --> 04:36.444
HEY!

04:36.513 --> 04:37.512
THANKS FOR THE PICK-UP.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.447
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

04:43.052 --> 04:45.052
OKAY, MAYBE
A SLIGHT PROBLEM.

04:47.090 --> 04:48.290
WHO DRIVES STANDARD ANYMORE?

04:48.358 --> 04:50.057
OH, COME ON,
THIS CAR'S A CLASSIC.

04:51.261 --> 04:53.428
DOESN'T HELP THAT
IT'S DAD'S BABY.

04:53.463 --> 04:55.096
JUST GIVE IT
A LITTLE MORE GAS

04:55.165 --> 04:56.598
AND LIFT OFF THE CLUTCH
A BIT EASIER.

04:56.633 --> 04:57.499
YOU GOT THIS.

05:02.706 --> 05:04.372
[CRUNCHING]

05:14.318 --> 05:16.851
CLASSIC.

05:27.731 --> 05:29.564

05:29.599 --> 05:30.699
GET INVOLVED!

05:33.470 --> 05:34.536
WEBSITE'S ON THE FLYER.

05:34.571 --> 05:36.170
GET INVOLVED!

05:37.307 --> 05:38.906
OKAY, LET'S MOVE IT OVER HERE.

05:40.444 --> 05:41.376
[MURMURING]

05:41.411 --> 05:42.677
OH, HI.

05:42.713 --> 05:43.611
WELCOME TO
RAGS TO RICHES.

05:43.647 --> 05:44.612
CAN WE HELP YOU?

05:44.648 --> 05:46.981
HI, YES,
I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN.

05:48.452 --> 05:50.918
THIS BELONGED
TO MY MOTHER IN-LAW.

05:50.954 --> 05:52.153
I'M WONDERING

05:52.188 --> 05:53.187
IF YOU MIGHT KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT IT?

05:55.459 --> 05:57.759
[JENN]: OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

05:57.828 --> 05:59.327
OH, THIS IS, UH...

05:59.363 --> 06:01.028
THIS IS PRETTY
LOCKED UP, HUH?

06:01.064 --> 06:03.732
I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO OPEN IT.

06:03.767 --> 06:04.899
JENN?

06:04.968 --> 06:09.003
UM, MAYBE TALK
ABOUT THE BOX...

06:09.038 --> 06:11.305
ITS ORIGIN,
ITS HISTORY.

06:11.341 --> 06:13.274
MA'AM, WOULD YOU MIND
IF WE FILMED THIS?

06:13.309 --> 06:15.543
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT,
ACTUALLY.

06:15.579 --> 06:16.678
THANK YOU...

06:16.713 --> 06:18.613
BUT ANY EXTRA INFO
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

06:18.648 --> 06:19.814
LET'S JUST CUT.

06:19.883 --> 06:21.683
OKAY, UH, WELL,
THIS IS A PUZZLE BOX,

06:21.718 --> 06:23.184
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW.

06:23.219 --> 06:24.586
IT'S ORIGINALLY

06:24.621 --> 06:29.090
FROM 2ND OR 3RD CENTURY
GREEK MECHANICAL PUZZLES.

06:29.125 --> 06:29.991
MM-HMM, THE SAME CULTURE
THAT BROUGHT YOU

06:30.026 --> 06:31.292
THE PANDORA'S BOX MYTH.

06:31.361 --> 06:33.094
[JENN]: RIGHT, AND IN FACT,

06:33.162 --> 06:34.228
SOME OF THE FIRST
COMBINATION LOCKS WERE PUZZLES.

06:34.297 --> 06:35.897
VAULTS, TOO, YEAH.

06:35.932 --> 06:37.565
SO THERE COULD BE
SOMETHING VALUABLE INSIDE?

06:37.601 --> 06:38.833
WELL, THERE COULD BE.

06:38.869 --> 06:41.335
THESE WERE NOVELTY GIFTS
IN 19TH-CENTURY ENGLAND,

06:41.405 --> 06:44.205
AND PEOPLE DID STORE
THINGS IN THEM,

06:44.240 --> 06:46.274
BUT THIS ONE
LOOKS FAIRLY NEW,

06:46.309 --> 06:48.643
ALTHOUGH THE WORK
IS VERY INTRICATE.

06:48.712 --> 06:49.944
WERE YOU INTERESTED
IN SELLING IT?

06:50.013 --> 06:52.514
WELL, IT BELONGED
TO MY MOTHER-IN-LAW, ELIZABETH,

06:52.582 --> 06:54.616
WHO PASSED AWAY RECENTLY.

06:54.684 --> 06:56.584
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING INSIDE

06:56.653 --> 06:58.085
BEFORE I DECIDE TO SELL IT.

06:58.121 --> 07:00.221
I THINK WE CAN HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

07:00.256 --> 07:01.890
I'D ALSO READ
THAT, SOMETIMES,

07:01.925 --> 07:03.124
THERE ARE TRIGGERS
IN THESE

07:03.159 --> 07:06.193
THAT WILL SMASH
WHATEVER'S INSIDE

07:06.229 --> 07:07.762
IF YOU TRY TO BREAK IT
INSTEAD OF SOLVING IT?

07:07.831 --> 07:09.597
YES, THAT'S TRUE.

07:09.633 --> 07:12.033
SO, DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET IT OPEN?

07:13.202 --> 07:14.636
WELL, IT USUALLY TAKES
ONE OR TWO CIPHERS

07:14.671 --> 07:15.904
TO UNLOCK THESE,

07:15.939 --> 07:17.705
BUT THE SYMBOLS
ON HERE

07:17.741 --> 07:18.706
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE FROM
DIFFERENT CULTURES,

07:18.742 --> 07:21.175
ALMOST LIKE
YOU'D NEED A TRANSLATOR.

07:21.210 --> 07:24.111
GIVE ME A FEW DAYS
TO DO SOME RESEARCH.

07:24.180 --> 07:25.713
THE SOONER THE BETTER,
MISS...

07:25.749 --> 07:26.781
OH, JENN,
I'M JENN,

07:26.817 --> 07:27.849
AND THIS IS
MY PARTNER, DANI,

07:27.918 --> 07:28.983
AND YOU ARE?

07:29.052 --> 07:30.685
TAMARA ANDRONICUS.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.687
ANDRONICUS,
LIKE THE REAL-ESTATE DEVELOPERS?

07:32.756 --> 07:34.255
YES.

07:34.290 --> 07:35.423
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW
IS ELIZABETH ANDRONICUS?

07:35.459 --> 07:36.691
WAS.

07:36.726 --> 07:37.692
YOU KNEW HER?

07:37.727 --> 07:40.462
NO, NO.

07:40.530 --> 07:42.530
I'M SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT HER PASSING.

07:42.566 --> 07:44.031
I READ SHE HAD TWO SONS?

07:44.100 --> 07:45.399
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

07:45.435 --> 07:48.703
WELL, LUCAS IS STRUGGLING,
OF COURSE.

07:48.738 --> 07:51.105
WE DON'T REALLY HEAR
FROM QUIN ANYMORE.

07:51.140 --> 07:53.207
DO YOU HAVE A PEN
SO I COULD WRITE DOWN MY NUMBER?

07:53.242 --> 07:54.509
SURE, OF COURSE.

07:58.882 --> 07:59.914
THANK YOU.

07:59.983 --> 08:01.783
WELL,
I SHOULD GET GOING.

08:01.818 --> 08:05.553
IF THERE IS ANYTHING
PERSONAL IN THIS BOX,

08:05.589 --> 08:07.021
DISCRETION
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.758
MAYBE BEFORE YOU OPEN
THE FINAL CIPHER,

08:10.827 --> 08:11.893
YOU COULD BRING IT BY THE HOUSE

08:11.962 --> 08:12.961
AND SHOW ME
HOW TO OPEN IT?

08:12.996 --> 08:14.562
ABSOLUTELY.
WE CAN DO THAT.

08:14.598 --> 08:15.964
GREAT.

08:15.999 --> 08:16.865
IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING AT ALL FROM ME,

08:16.900 --> 08:17.832
JUST LET ME KNOW.

08:17.868 --> 08:18.933
SAME.

08:18.969 --> 08:19.934
NICE TO MEET YOU,
TAMARA.

08:19.970 --> 08:22.036
THANK YOU,
AND I GUESS... GOOD LUCK.

08:22.071 --> 08:23.371
LUCK'S WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO NEED.

08:25.174 --> 08:26.140
EXCUSE ME.

08:26.209 --> 08:28.409
EXCUSE ME,
MRS. ANDRONICUS.

08:28.478 --> 08:29.544
I'M JOEL JACOBS.

08:29.613 --> 08:30.979
I'M THE PRODUCER.

08:31.014 --> 08:32.647
WE'VE MET, RIGHT?

08:32.682 --> 08:34.215
YES, YES, WE HAVE.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.950
I USED TO PLAY POKER WITH LUCAS.

08:38.421 --> 08:39.486
IS THERE ANY WAY

08:39.523 --> 08:42.356
THAT I COULD PERSUADE YOU
TO BE ON CAMERA?

08:42.424 --> 08:43.758
I MEAN,
IT WOULD REALLY HELP ME OUT.

08:43.793 --> 08:45.660
LOOK...

08:45.695 --> 08:47.662
I DO REMEMBER
THOSE LATE NIGHTS,

08:47.697 --> 08:48.963
BUT I'M SORRY.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.032
I'M JUST NOT A CAMERA PERSON.

08:51.067 --> 08:52.133
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU, THOUGH.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.403
YEAH, YOU TOO.

08:58.241 --> 08:59.173
IT DOES LOOK...

08:59.208 --> 09:00.074
[PHONE RINGING]

09:00.109 --> 09:01.943
OOH.

09:02.012 --> 09:03.545
HEY, SWEETHEART.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.346
OH, NO.

09:05.415 --> 09:08.082
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

09:08.117 --> 09:10.051
DO YOU WANT ME TO MEET YOU THERE
OR AT HOME?

09:11.988 --> 09:13.521
NO, FINE.
I'M ON MY WAY.

09:13.557 --> 09:15.557
WELL, THIS MAIL BOX
HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS...

09:17.193 --> 09:18.459
BUT IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE.

09:18.528 --> 09:19.493
CAN YOU GET THIS CAR HOME?

09:19.529 --> 09:21.328
MY DAD'S ON HIS WAY.

09:21.364 --> 09:23.230
[OFFICER]:
THAT'S NEVER FUN...

09:23.266 --> 09:24.632
AND WHERE DO I KNOW YOU FROM?

09:24.701 --> 09:25.700
IT'S BEEN BUGGING ME.

09:25.735 --> 09:27.835
OH, WAIT, UM...

09:27.871 --> 09:29.236
CRIM-PSYCH AT U.M.

09:29.272 --> 09:30.371
YOU SAT AT THE FRONT, RIGHT?

09:30.406 --> 09:31.573
I TOOK THAT CLASS
FRESHMAN YEAR.

09:31.608 --> 09:32.907
I KNEW IT.

09:32.943 --> 09:34.909
I DID SOME PREREQS THERE
BEFORE ENTERING THE ACADEMY.

09:34.945 --> 09:36.744
YOU OBVIOUSLY
GRADUATED.

09:36.780 --> 09:38.880
I DID.
YOU?

09:38.949 --> 09:40.281
I'M WORKING
ON MY MASTER'S.

09:40.316 --> 09:41.716
IMPRESSIVE.

09:49.593 --> 09:50.658
YOU'RE BOTH OKAY?

09:50.694 --> 09:51.960
I, UH...

09:51.995 --> 09:54.195
I MESSED UP
WITH THE REVERSE.

09:54.230 --> 09:55.897
I'M TOTALLY SORRY.

09:55.966 --> 09:57.331
CARS CAN BE REPLACED.

09:57.366 --> 09:58.733
FAMILY CAN'T.

09:58.768 --> 10:00.434
DAD, YOU'RE GRIPPING
A LITTLE TIGHT.

10:00.503 --> 10:01.368
I'M SORRY.

10:03.073 --> 10:04.005
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

10:04.074 --> 10:04.973
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

10:05.041 --> 10:07.541
WELL, FIX THE CAR
AND THE MAILBOX,

10:07.611 --> 10:10.044
BUT LIKE I WAS TELLING YOUR SON,
IT COULD'VE BEEN WORSE.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.378
I DID THE SAME THING
TO MY PARENT'S CAR

10:11.414 --> 10:12.814
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE.

10:12.849 --> 10:14.148
RITE OF PASSAGE, I GUESS,

10:14.183 --> 10:15.950
BUT JUST BE MORE CAREFUL,
PLEASE?

10:15.986 --> 10:16.918
I WILL.

10:18.622 --> 10:20.421
HERE'S MY CARD.
DRIVE SAFE.

10:20.456 --> 10:21.789
EXCUSE ME.

10:28.131 --> 10:30.698
I JUST HAD HER PAINTED.

10:30.734 --> 10:32.900
DAD, ARE YOU
TEARING UP?

10:34.070 --> 10:35.036
NO, JUST...

10:35.071 --> 10:36.203
SOMETHING IN THE WIND.

10:42.979 --> 10:43.811
[JASON]:
YES, I UNDERSTAND.

10:43.847 --> 10:44.979
THANK YOU.

10:45.048 --> 10:47.048
SO OUR DEDUCTIBLE IS $300,

10:47.083 --> 10:50.384

21:02.935 --> 21:05.369
NO, I DIDN'T SEE IT,
I ONLY HEARD IT.

21:05.404 --> 21:07.171
OKAY.

21:07.206 --> 21:08.672
SHOULD I EVEN ASK
WHY YOU'RE HERE?

21:08.707 --> 21:10.174
TAMARA ANDRONICUS,

21:10.242 --> 21:11.741
SHE BROUGHT A PUZZLE BOX
INTO THE STORE,

21:11.777 --> 21:12.742
AND THEN
IT WENT MISSING.

21:12.811 --> 21:14.044
MISSING OR STOLEN?

21:14.113 --> 21:15.279
I'M NOT SURE,

21:15.314 --> 21:16.246
BUT WHEN I CAME BY
TO BREAK THE BAD NEWS,

21:16.282 --> 21:18.515
I SAW A SMASHED VASE
ON THE FLOOR,

21:18.551 --> 21:20.451
AND THEN I SAW SOME MOVEMENT
BY THE BACK DOOR.

21:20.486 --> 21:23.287
AND HOW DID YOU GET
IN THE HOUSE?

21:23.355 --> 21:25.122
SO THE FRONT DOOR WAS LOCKED.

21:25.157 --> 21:26.356
I CAME AROUND BACK.

21:26.425 --> 21:28.892
THIS WAS KNOCKED OVER,
AND THAT DOOR WAS OPEN.

21:28.927 --> 21:30.227
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE SOMEBODY RUNNING AWAY.

21:30.262 --> 21:32.963
WELL, ANYTHING COULD
HAVE KNOCKED THAT OVER.

21:32.998 --> 21:35.065
WELL, TRUE,
BUT THERE'S THAT.

21:35.101 --> 21:37.201
[FRANK]:
IT'S A LAND LINE.

21:37.236 --> 21:39.336
THERE WAS A BIG
STORM ON SUNDAY.

21:39.405 --> 21:40.471
ANYTHING ELSE?

21:40.539 --> 21:41.572
YES.

21:41.607 --> 21:43.273
TAMARA'S CELL PHONE...

21:43.309 --> 21:46.276
A LOCAL AREA CODE,
LAST FOUR DIGITS 2428,

21:46.345 --> 21:48.412
AND THE TEXT SAID, "I'M SORRY."

21:48.447 --> 21:51.215
SAME TEXT THAT I SEND
MY WIFE DAILY.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.217
RIGHT NOW,
SOMEBODY'S FALLEN.

21:53.252 --> 21:54.851
THAT'S WHERE WE START.

21:54.886 --> 21:56.553
RIGHT.

21:56.589 --> 21:58.688
I DO APPRECIATE
YOUR EYE, THOUGH.

22:00.692 --> 22:02.292
THE BODY WAS AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS.

22:02.328 --> 22:03.393
I KNOW.

22:03.429 --> 22:04.928
I FOUND HER MOTHER-IN-LAW
IN THE SAME AREA

22:04.997 --> 22:06.330
JUST TWO NIGHTS AGO.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.599
REALLY?

22:08.634 --> 22:10.267
MM-HMM.

22:10.336 --> 22:12.669
WELL, HOW
DID SHE DIE?

22:12.704 --> 22:15.205
WELL, WE'RE AWAITING
THE AUTOPSY RESULTS,

22:15.241 --> 22:16.240
BUT LOOKS LIKE
AN ACCIDENTAL FALL

22:16.275 --> 22:17.307
DOWN THE STAIRS.

22:17.343 --> 22:19.309
TWO ACCIDENTS
ON THE SAME STAIRS?

22:19.345 --> 22:20.644
THAT'S A LITTLE ODD,
ISN'T IT?

22:20.712 --> 22:21.811
VERY.

22:21.847 --> 22:23.514
THE MOTHER-IN-LAW
DIES ON SUNDAY.

22:23.549 --> 22:25.815
TAMARA BRINGS A PUZZLE BOX
INTO THE STORE ON MONDAY,

22:25.884 --> 22:27.551
AND SHE DIES
ON TUESDAY?

22:27.586 --> 22:31.087
YEAH... VERY ODD.

22:31.123 --> 22:34.124
COULD THERE BE SOMETHING
IN THAT PUZZLE BOX...

22:34.160 --> 22:35.925
THAT TAMARA WANTED
US TO FIND?

22:35.961 --> 22:37.394
OR MAYBE IT'S JUST A BOX.

22:38.697 --> 22:39.996
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

22:40.032 --> 22:42.166
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I GOT BACK TO WORK?

22:42.234 --> 22:43.567
OH!

22:43.602 --> 22:45.101
YEAH, GO.

22:45.171 --> 22:46.203
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

22:46.238 --> 22:47.271
YEAH.

22:59.151 --> 23:00.317
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:01.953 --> 23:02.686
MR. ANDRONICUS?

23:02.721 --> 23:04.154
YEAH.

23:06.158 --> 23:07.291
PLEASE...

23:07.359 --> 23:08.625
LET'S HAVE A SEAT.

23:08.661 --> 23:10.294
I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE A SEAT.

23:10.329 --> 23:11.261
WHERE'S MY WIFE?

23:11.297 --> 23:13.330
WHERE'S TAMARA?

23:13.365 --> 23:15.765
PLEASE...
FOLLOW ME.

23:22.274 --> 23:23.440
I'M SORRY
TO INFORM YOU,

23:23.475 --> 23:25.242
BUT WE'VE FOUND YOUR
WIFE DECEASED TODAY.

23:25.277 --> 23:26.976
WHAT?

23:27.012 --> 23:28.912
NO...

23:28.947 --> 23:31.548
NO, NO...

23:31.584 --> 23:33.250
IT SEEMS SHE MAY HAVE
FALLEN DOWN THE STAIRS.

23:36.222 --> 23:38.322
WHAT?
NO, I DON'T...

23:38.357 --> 23:39.856
COULD YOU TELL ME
WHERE YOU WERE EARLIER TODAY?

23:39.891 --> 23:42.559
I WAS TAKING CARE
OF ARRANGEMENTS

23:42.595 --> 23:43.727
FOR MY MOTHER'S FUNERAL.

23:43.795 --> 23:44.695
I WASN'T...

23:46.898 --> 23:47.931
YOU DON'T THINK I DID THIS?

23:47.999 --> 23:51.668
NO,
IT'S JUST STANDARD PROCEDURE.

23:51.737 --> 23:54.804
A... LITTLE RIP THERE
ON YOUR SHIRT.

23:57.476 --> 24:00.677
WHEN I SAW
THE POLICE CARS IN THE DRIVEWAY,

24:00.713 --> 24:01.978
I RUSHED TO GET OUT OF MY CAR.

24:02.013 --> 24:03.079
I CAUGHT MY SHIRT
ON THE DOOR.

24:03.115 --> 24:04.147
OKAY.

24:05.718 --> 24:07.016
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE

24:07.052 --> 24:09.453
WHO WOULD HAVE WANTED
TO HURT TAMARA OR ELIZABETH?

24:09.488 --> 24:11.087
NO.

24:11.123 --> 24:12.322
SO I'M ASSUMING

24:12.358 --> 24:13.624
WITH A HOUSE THIS SIZE

24:13.659 --> 24:14.758
THAT YOU HAVE
A HOUSE STAFF?

24:16.528 --> 24:17.961
THEY WERE LET GO,

24:17.996 --> 24:19.829
ON GOOD TERMS
AND WITH SEVERANCE.

24:19.865 --> 24:21.698
ANY PARTICULAR REASON
FOR LETTING THEM GO?

24:21.734 --> 24:23.367
MOTHER'S BEEN
HOUSEBOUND

24:23.402 --> 24:25.101
FOR MOST OF
THIS PAST YEAR.

24:25.137 --> 24:28.438
SHE'S GOTTEN WORSE
IN THE LAST WEEK.

24:28.507 --> 24:29.740
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
WANTED HER STAFF

24:29.808 --> 24:31.742
TO SEE HER THAT WAY.

24:31.777 --> 24:33.610
TAMARA WANTED TO TAKE A HIATUS
FROM OUR BUSINESS

24:33.679 --> 24:35.479
AND TAKE CARE OF HER FULL-TIME.

24:35.514 --> 24:36.980
SO YOU CUT SHORT
YOUR BUSINESS TRIP

24:37.015 --> 24:38.448
WITH YOUR FATHER,

24:38.484 --> 24:41.151
FLEW HOME ON SUNDAY,
HOPING TO SEE YOUR MOTHER

24:41.186 --> 24:42.686
TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE'S OKAY?

24:42.755 --> 24:44.954
I'VE ALREADY ANSWERED ALL THIS
IN MY PREVIOUS STATEMENT.

24:45.023 --> 24:47.157
REFRESH MY MEMORY.

24:47.192 --> 24:49.593
YES, EXACTLY.

24:49.628 --> 24:50.794
SHE WASN'T RETURNING
ANY OF MY EMAILS

24:50.862 --> 24:53.363
OR ANSWERING MY PHONE CALLS,
AND...

24:53.399 --> 24:56.600
AND THEN WHEN YOU GOT HOME,
YOU FOUND YOUR MOTHER THERE.

24:56.635 --> 24:57.567
I DROVE BACK
FROM THE AIRPORT

24:57.603 --> 25:00.470
AFTER A BRUTAL 17-HOUR FLIGHT,

25:00.506 --> 25:02.739
AND, UH...
I JUST...

25:05.778 --> 25:07.377
I FOUND TAMARA HERE.

25:10.015 --> 25:11.147
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

25:11.183 --> 25:16.019
SHE WAS JUST STANDING
OVER MOTHER, CRYING.

25:16.054 --> 25:17.521
AND YOUR FATHER?

25:17.589 --> 25:18.955
WHERE IS HE?

25:18.990 --> 25:20.490
I'M ASSUMING HE'S BACK?

25:20.526 --> 25:22.058
HE'S STAYING
AT THE GRAND HOTEL.

25:22.127 --> 25:25.395
HE SAYS IT'S TOO TRAUMATIC
TO STAY HERE AT THE HOUSE.

25:25.431 --> 25:26.530
UNDERSTANDABLE,

25:26.565 --> 25:29.966
BUT WHAT I NEED TO KNOW,
IN YOUR OPINION...

25:30.001 --> 25:31.501
DO YOU KNOW
OF ANYONE WHO WOULD'VE WANTED

25:31.537 --> 25:33.470
TO HURT YOUR MOM OR TAMARA?

25:35.641 --> 25:38.375
I'M SURE WITH THE NEW CONDOS
GOING UP ON MAIN STREET,

25:38.410 --> 25:41.311
HALF THE TOWN WOULD LIKE
TO SEE ANY ONE OF US GONE.

25:43.215 --> 25:44.948
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
[HANNAH]: HELLO?

25:44.983 --> 25:47.250
<i>HEY, IT'S OFFICER RYAN,</i>
<i>A.K.A. BRETT.</i>

25:47.285 --> 25:48.251
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

25:48.286 --> 25:49.820
<i>GREAT.</i>

25:49.855 --> 25:51.788
I WAS THINKING MAYBE YOU WANTED
TO HAVE LUNCH OR SOMETHING

25:51.824 --> 25:52.823
TOMORROW?

25:52.891 --> 25:53.890
TITUS GRILL, NOON?

25:53.925 --> 25:54.924
NOON WORKS.

25:54.993 --> 25:56.360
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.
BYE.

25:56.395 --> 25:57.160
OFFICER HANDSOME?

25:57.195 --> 25:58.795
OFFICER TOTALLY HANDSOME.

25:58.831 --> 26:00.230
HOW'S THE FUND-RAISER GOING?

26:00.265 --> 26:01.732
SLOW BUT STEADY.

26:03.001 --> 26:03.834
DEFINE "STEADY."

26:05.303 --> 26:06.870
NOTHING.

26:06.905 --> 26:08.638
YOU NEED CASH
TO MAKE A BUSINESS.

26:08.674 --> 26:10.240
CASH IS SOMETHING
YOU DON'T HAVE.

26:12.210 --> 26:13.377
HEY, MAYBE I COULD START

26:13.412 --> 26:14.711
BY TAKING OUT
A PERSONAL LOAN FROM YOU.

26:14.780 --> 26:15.812
OR MAYBE YOU CAN START

26:15.848 --> 26:17.447
BY TAKING OUT
THE RECYCLING.

26:17.516 --> 26:18.682
THE CLASSIFIEDS
ARE ON TOP.

26:21.987 --> 26:24.421
<i>NOW, I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT</i>
<i>WITH MY RETIREMENT</i>

26:24.490 --> 26:26.923
<i>AND WITH HANDING THE REINS OVER</i>
<i>TO MY SON, LUCAS,</i>

26:26.958 --> 26:28.859
<i>THAT ANDRONOCORP</i>
<i>IS GOING TO BE TAKEN</i>

26:28.894 --> 26:31.828
<i>TO EVEN MORE TREMENDOUS</i>
<i>LEVELS OF SUCCESS,</i>

26:31.864 --> 26:33.597
<i>BUT I WILL SAY JUST THAT.</i>

26:33.632 --> 26:34.931
<i>[LAUGHING]</i>

26:34.966 --> 26:36.332
<i>SO IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,</i>

26:36.368 --> 26:38.635
<i>I HAVE A NEW HIP</i>
<i>I WANT TO TRY OUT ON THE LINKS.</i>

26:38.670 --> 26:41.004
[LAUGHING]

26:41.039 --> 26:43.607
LUCAS!

26:48.781 --> 26:50.013
SO I PICKED UP
SOME WOOD TODAY

26:50.081 --> 26:52.048
FOR THE BROKEN MAILBOX.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.149
THINKING ABOUT
HELPING LOGAN OUT

26:53.184 --> 26:54.684
AND FIXING IT MYSELF.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.220
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

26:57.255 --> 26:58.688
CAN YOU BUILD ME
A REPLICA PUZZLE BOX

26:58.724 --> 26:59.656
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT?

26:59.691 --> 27:00.924
HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET?

27:00.959 --> 27:01.958
NOPE,

27:01.993 --> 27:03.359
AND I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER

27:03.395 --> 27:05.295
IF SOMETHING VALUABLE
WAS INSIDE.

27:05.330 --> 27:07.831
WE HAVE WAY MORE EXPENSIVE
PIECES IN THE STORE,

27:07.900 --> 27:09.999
AND THE WOMAN WHO BRINGS IT IN
TURNS UP DEAD A DAY LATER?

27:10.035 --> 27:12.101
IT COULD BE A COINCIDENCE.

27:12.137 --> 27:13.437
TWO ACCIDENTS
IN THE SAME HOUSE

27:13.472 --> 27:15.204
IN THE SAME WEEK?

27:15.240 --> 27:17.307
AND I'M LOOKING AT
THE ANDRONICUS WEBSITE.

27:17.342 --> 27:19.342
BOTH TAMARA AND ELIZABETH
HELPED RUN THE COMPANY,

27:19.411 --> 27:21.445
AND THEY'RE BOTH
MYSTERIOUSLY GONE.

27:21.513 --> 27:22.412
WHO'D WANT TO HURT THEM?

27:22.481 --> 27:23.447
I DON'T KNOW.

27:23.482 --> 27:25.248
MAYBE SOMEONE AFTER THEIR MONEY?

27:25.283 --> 27:26.550
BUT IF IT WERE
AN INHERITANCE THING,

27:26.585 --> 27:29.152
WOULDN'T HARVEY ANDRONICUS
BE THE LOGICAL TARGET?

27:29.187 --> 27:31.387
AND LUCAS WAS GETTING READY
TO TAKE OVER THE COMPANY.

27:31.423 --> 27:33.256
MAYBE SOMEBODY
DIDN'T WANT THAT?

27:33.325 --> 27:34.791
MM, MAYBE.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.660
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
I'M NOT GETTING YET.

27:36.728 --> 27:37.961
YET?

27:38.029 --> 27:40.464
LET FRANK HANDLE IT, OKAY?

27:41.967 --> 27:43.066
OKAY.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.213
<i>[LINE RINGING]</i>
HEY LOGAN.

27:49.263 --> 27:50.329
HEY, MOM, WHAT'S UP?

27:50.397 --> 27:52.331
<i>I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT</i>
<i>A PHONE NUMBER.</i>

27:52.366 --> 27:56.135
THE LAST FOUR DIGITS ARE 2428,
AND IT'S A LOCAL AREA CODE.

27:56.170 --> 27:57.737
CAN YOU FIND THAT ONLINE?

27:57.772 --> 27:59.138
YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.

27:59.173 --> 28:00.439
HOLD ON.

28:03.410 --> 28:04.243
<i>UH-OH.</i>

28:04.278 --> 28:07.479
799 NUMBERS STATEWIDE.

28:07.514 --> 28:09.849
<i>THAT'S A LOT OF CALLS TO MAKE.</i>

28:09.884 --> 28:12.785
BUT IF IT'S WITHIN OUR AREA,

28:12.820 --> 28:15.487
THEN WE'RE DOWN
TO FIVE PHONE CALLS.

28:15.522 --> 28:16.956
I COULD ALSO GET
THE NAMES OF PEOPLE,

28:16.991 --> 28:18.023
IF YOU LIKE?

28:18.092 --> 28:19.759
LOGAN,
WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?

28:19.794 --> 28:22.294
MAYBE WE COULD WRITE THIS DOWN
AS A CONSULTATION FEE?

28:22.329 --> 28:24.196
I COULD KNOCK 20 BUCKS
OFF YOUR TAB.

28:24.265 --> 28:24.997
HOW ABOUT 50?

28:25.066 --> 28:26.065
30.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.099

LOVE YOU.

28:27.168 --> 28:28.367
LOVE YOU, TOO.

28:31.105 --> 28:34.140
NO INJURIES
OR MUCOSAL LESIONS SEEN.

28:35.342 --> 28:39.344
WHY IS IT EVERY TIME
I SMELL CARAMEL MACCHIATO,

28:39.380 --> 28:42.414
I THINK OF JENN SHANNON?

28:42.449 --> 28:43.849
GOOD MORNING, MY FRIEND.

28:43.885 --> 28:46.518
AH...

28:50.357 --> 28:52.691

I'VE DECIDED WHEN I GO,

28:52.760 --> 28:55.094
IT'S CREMATION ALL THE WAY.

28:55.129 --> 28:56.695
OKAY, I'LL BITE... WHY?

28:56.730 --> 29:00.099
IT'S MY LAST CHANCE
AT A SMOKING BODY.

29:01.535 --> 29:03.502
THAT'S ACTUALLY
ONE OF YOUR BETTER ONES.

29:03.537 --> 29:04.503
[LAUGHING]

29:04.571 --> 29:07.039
HOW CAN I HELP YOU TODAY?

29:08.375 --> 29:11.177
ELIZABETH
AND TAMARA ANDRONICUS?

29:11.212 --> 29:12.244
THEY COULD BE HERE,

29:12.280 --> 29:13.679
BUT YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT
FROM ME, RIGHT?

29:13.714 --> 29:15.781
OH, OF COURSE NOT.

29:15.817 --> 29:18.750
I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT
THEIR TWO "ACCIDENTS".

29:18.786 --> 29:21.053
COULD THERE BE SIGNS THAT
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE?

29:21.122 --> 29:25.191
BY "ELSE," COULD YOU BE
INSINUATING FOUL PLAY?

29:25.226 --> 29:26.725
COULD BE.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.227
NOTHING OFFICIAL.

29:28.262 --> 29:29.728
WE'RE STRICTLY TALKING "COULDS."

29:29.763 --> 29:31.496
WHILE THE HEAVY STRESS
ON ELIZABETH'S HEART

29:31.532 --> 29:32.865
WAS IRREGULAR FOR HER ILLNESS,

29:32.934 --> 29:35.400
NOTHING ELSE
IS SHOWING UP SO FAR.

29:35.436 --> 29:36.568
IRREGULAR?

29:36.603 --> 29:39.171
ELIZABETH HAD A SUDDEN
MASSIVE HEART ATTACK,

29:39.240 --> 29:42.007
BUT HER MEDICAL REPORTS
DON'T INDICATE HEART DISEASE,

29:42.043 --> 29:45.510
WEAKNESS,
OR ANY GENETIC ANOMALIES.

29:45.579 --> 29:47.412
HER ILLNESS STEMMED

29:47.448 --> 29:50.149
FROM BLOOD AND OSTEOSARCOMA
CANCER COMPLICATIONS

29:50.184 --> 29:51.884
IN HER KNEES,

29:51.919 --> 29:55.221
AND THOSE COMPLICATIONS USUALLY
LEAD TO BLEEDING IN THE BRAIN,

29:55.289 --> 29:58.690
AND THAT WOULD CAUSE A STROKE,
NOT A HEART ATTACK.

29:58.726 --> 30:01.526
SO WHAT COULD'VE CAUSED
ELIZABETH'S HEART ATTACK?

30:01.595 --> 30:03.729
SHE WAS GETTING UP
IN AGE.

30:03.764 --> 30:06.165
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
SHE WAS SCARED TO DEATH?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.667
OR IT COULD'VE BEEN
AN ALLERGIC REACTION.

30:08.736 --> 30:11.636
I DID FIND
A PEANUT ALLERGY HERE.

30:11.672 --> 30:14.406
EVEN JUST A SLIGHT INHALE
FROM PEANUT VAPOR

30:14.441 --> 30:16.208
COULD TRIGGER
AN ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK.

30:16.244 --> 30:18.077
AND THAT SHOCK COULD CAUSE
A HEART ATTACK?

30:18.112 --> 30:19.578
COULD HAVE,

30:19.613 --> 30:22.248
BUT THOSE MINIMAL PEANUT TRACES
ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND

30:22.283 --> 30:24.449
IN ANY AUTOPSY, IF EVER.

30:25.586 --> 30:26.718
WHAT ABOUT TAMARA?

30:26.754 --> 30:28.354
WELL, I DID FIND
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS

30:28.389 --> 30:30.356
OF MORPHINE SULFATE
IN HER MOUTH.

30:30.391 --> 30:31.490
MORPHINE SULFATE?

30:31.558 --> 30:33.993
HEAVY PRESCRIPTION
PAINKILLERS.

30:34.028 --> 30:36.028
SO AN OVERDOSE COULD
HAVE LED TO HER FALL?

30:36.097 --> 30:37.796
COULD HAVE,

30:37.831 --> 30:40.399
BUT IT "COULD BE" STRANGE

30:40.434 --> 30:42.902
THAT ONLY THE POWDER
FROM THE MORPHINE SULFATE PILLS

30:42.937 --> 30:44.370
WAS FOUND IN HER MOUTH.

30:44.405 --> 30:46.805
IT'S AS IF
THE CAPSULE SHELLS

30:46.840 --> 30:48.473
WERE PULLED APART
MANUALLY,

30:48.509 --> 30:50.376
THE CONTENTS EMPTIED
INTO HER MOUTH,

30:50.411 --> 30:53.512
AND THE SHELLS DISCARDED
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.480
SO THE MORPHINE
COULD HAVE BEEN PLACED THERE

30:55.549 --> 30:56.916
AFTER TAMARA'S DEATH,

30:56.951 --> 31:00.119
MAKING IT LOOK LIKE AN OVERDOSE
THAT LED TO THE FALL?

31:00.154 --> 31:01.887
A KILLER COVERING THEIR TRACKS?

31:01.923 --> 31:03.155
COULD,

31:03.190 --> 31:06.491
BUT YOU WON'T GET
ANYTHING OUT OF ME.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.528
SO WHILE ELIZABETH'S DEATH
COULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT,

31:09.563 --> 31:11.563
TAMARA'S
IS MOST LIKELY A MURDER?

31:11.598 --> 31:15.234
NOW, THAT'S
A VERY STRONG COULD.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.340
DANI, GO A LITTLE BIGGER.

31:21.375 --> 31:22.341
MORE DRAMA.

31:22.376 --> 31:23.409
LET'S REHEARSE IT.

31:23.444 --> 31:24.410
OKAY.

31:24.445 --> 31:25.377
MORE DRAMA?

31:25.413 --> 31:26.578
I CAN DO THAT.

31:26.647 --> 31:27.779

31:27.815 --> 31:29.748
SO, STILL NO SIGN OF
THE MISSING PUZZLE BOX

ISN'T HERE.

I TURNED IT OFF.

REALLY GOOD, 'KAY?

UH, LISTEN, GUYS,
IF WE DON'T FIND THE PUZZLE BOX,

32:09.323 --> 32:10.655
IS THERE ANOTHER PIECE
IN THE STORE

32:10.691 --> 32:12.591
THAT WE COULD MAYBE USE?

32:12.659 --> 32:14.526
IF WE DON'T FIND IT
BY THE END OF DAY,

32:14.595 --> 32:15.494
WE'LL ADJUST.

32:15.562 --> 32:16.728

33:03.110 --> 33:04.809
YES.

I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

THE PUZZLE BOX IN

33:14.088 --> 33:16.488
YEAH, I TOLD JOEL

33:16.524 --> 33:19.058
AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T BRING
OUR NAME INTO IT.

33:19.093 --> 33:22.394
AH, MIGHT MAKE
A NICE TRIBUTE FOR MOTHER.

33:22.463 --> 33:23.828

OH, YOUR MOTHER MADE THEM?

33:25.933 --> 33:27.566

SOMETHING VALUABLE INSIDE

WANTED?

FROM THE BEGINNING.

37:03.608 --> 37:06.509
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN HOW HIGH
SHE ROSE IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

37:06.577 --> 37:08.310
SHE NEVER LOVED LUCAS.

37:09.914 --> 37:11.313

YOU'RE NOT HER BIGGEST FAN.

37:12.617 --> 37:13.716
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
HER KILLER.

37:15.186 --> 37:15.985

38:03.301 --> 38:04.801
AT THE TIME OF TAMARA'S DEATH,

38:04.836 --> 38:07.737
BUT HE LEFT
THE FUNERAL PARLOR EARLY.

38:07.772 --> 38:09.505
HE COULD'VE DRIVEN HOME
TO SEE HER.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.473
HE WAS IN TOWN
FOR BOTH DEATHS,

38:11.542 --> 38:13.843
SHOWS UP AT THE SCENE
WITH A RIPPED SHIRT,

38:13.878 --> 38:17.313
PLUS HE WAS THE ONE WHO WAS
CLEANING OUT THE RECYCLING

38:17.381 --> 38:19.315
WHEN YOU NOTICED
THE PEANUT OIL.

38:19.350 --> 38:20.516
COULD HE REALLY
NOT HAVE SEEN IT?

38:20.551 --> 38:21.951
WELL, HE DIDN'T WANT
TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT

38:21.986 --> 38:23.086
WHILE I WAS THERE.

38:23.121 --> 38:24.653
THAT'D BE MY GUESS,

38:24.689 --> 38:26.823
BECAUSE WHEN I SPOKE
WITH THE FORMER CHEF,

38:26.858 --> 38:28.224
HE SAID THE PLACE WAS
A PEANUT-FREE ZONE,

38:28.259 --> 38:30.893
AND THE WHOLE STAFF
WAS LET GO

38:30.929 --> 38:32.061
BEFORE ELIZABETH DIED.

38:32.130 --> 38:35.397
SO SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE STAFF

38:35.433 --> 38:37.834
COULD HAVE SLIPPED THE OIL
INTO SOMETHING?

38:37.869 --> 38:39.668
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT LUCAS' BROTHER, QUIN?

38:39.738 --> 38:41.738
WELL, I KNOW THAT LUCAS HAS
A RESTRAINING ORDER AGAINST HIM,

38:41.773 --> 38:45.307
A FIGHT THAT TURNED VIOLENT
ABOUT A YEAR BACK.

38:45.343 --> 38:46.809
QUIN LEFT TOWN.

38:46.845 --> 38:49.712
HE NOW WORKS AS A LINGUISTICS
AND HUMAN STUDIES PROFESSOR

38:49.781 --> 38:50.813
ON THE WEST COAST.

38:50.849 --> 38:52.314
HE'S BACK IN TOWN

38:52.383 --> 38:53.649
TO HELP PLAN
HIS MOTHER'S FUNERAL.

38:53.684 --> 38:55.818
WHICH PUTS HIM HERE
AT THE TIME OF TAMARA'S DEATH.

38:55.854 --> 38:57.319
TRUE,

38:57.388 --> 38:58.755
BUT WITH QUIN'S ALIBI,

38:58.790 --> 38:59.856
THERE'S NO WAY

38:59.891 --> 39:01.224
THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN
AT THE HOUSE

39:01.292 --> 39:02.658
BETWEEN THE TIME YOU LEFT
THE STORE AND FOUND TAMARA,

39:02.727 --> 39:05.762
BUT HE DID BRING UP
THE FAMILY LAWYER,

39:05.797 --> 39:07.130
ALLAN DEMETRY,

39:07.165 --> 39:08.430
WHOM I'VE CALLED
AND HASN'T BEEN SEEN

39:08.466 --> 39:10.432
SINCE THE TIME
OF TAMARA'S DEATH.

39:10.501 --> 39:13.002
WENT BY THE HOUSE...
NO ANSWER.

39:13.037 --> 39:14.904
SO EITHER HE'S ON THE RUN, OR...

39:14.939 --> 39:16.338
OR ANOTHER VICTIM.

39:16.374 --> 39:17.406
MM.

39:17.475 --> 39:18.975
YOU KNOW
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND?

39:19.010 --> 39:20.576
WHAT'S THAT?

39:20.611 --> 39:22.912
IF QUIN WAS IN TOWN
TO PLAN HIS MOTHER'S FUNERAL,

39:22.981 --> 39:25.447
WHY DID HE CHECK INTO A MOTEL
A DAY BEFORE HIS MOTHER DIED?

39:27.218 --> 39:28.350
WELL,
THAT DOES MEAN ONE THING...

39:28.386 --> 39:30.820
BOTH BROTHERS WERE IN TOWN
FOR BOTH MURDERS.

39:30.855 --> 39:33.055
MM-HMM.

39:33.091 --> 39:35.158
NO CANDLES, NO MUSIC.

39:35.193 --> 39:36.793
JUST TACOS.

39:36.828 --> 39:38.594
I DON'T KNOW,
WAYS TO MY HEART...

39:38.629 --> 39:39.561
ONE, BUY ME TACOS,

39:39.597 --> 39:40.562
TWO, MAKE ME TACOS,

39:40.631 --> 39:41.964
AND THREE, BE A TACO.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.766
FINE, YOU'RE BUYING YOUR OWN.

39:43.802 --> 39:45.201
ONE TACO, PLEASE.

39:45.236 --> 39:46.869
SAME, THANKS.

39:46.905 --> 39:48.337
SO...

39:48.406 --> 39:49.738
SINCE WE'RE JUST HANGING OUT,

39:49.774 --> 39:52.008
CAN I ASK YOU
WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR EX?

39:52.043 --> 39:53.442
YOU CAN.

39:53.477 --> 39:54.443
I JUST DID.

39:54.478 --> 39:56.378
WHOA.

39:56.414 --> 39:57.579
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

39:59.750 --> 40:01.450
THANK YOU.

40:01.485 --> 40:02.518
WE NEVER REALLY ARGUED.

40:02.553 --> 40:04.520
SHE JUST WOULD EXPLAIN
REALLY LOUDLY

40:04.555 --> 40:06.455
WHY SHE WAS ALWAYS RIGHT.

40:06.490 --> 40:07.389
BEEN THERE.

40:07.425 --> 40:08.390
YEAH...

40:08.426 --> 40:09.525
AND THE WEIRDEST PART

40:09.560 --> 40:10.392
IS THAT I'VE HAD THIS
LAUNDRY BASKET,

40:10.428 --> 40:11.427
FULL OF HER THINGS

40:11.462 --> 40:13.196
JUST SITTING IN MY CLOSET,

40:13.231 --> 40:14.663
AND I HAVEN'T REALLY HAD
THE HEART TO GIVE IT BACK.

40:14.699 --> 40:15.497
HMM.

40:17.168 --> 40:18.534
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD,
I KNOW.

40:18.569 --> 40:20.469
NO, IT'S...

40:20.504 --> 40:21.971
OKAY, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

40:22.006 --> 40:23.605
WELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

40:23.641 --> 40:27.176
I'M NOT USUALLY
ONE TO GO LOOKING.

40:27.212 --> 40:28.211
I MEAN, I THINK

40:28.279 --> 40:29.812
WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR LOVE,

40:29.881 --> 40:31.214
YOU NEVER FIND IT.

40:31.249 --> 40:34.516
WELL, I THINK I'VE FOUND
TRUE LOVE RIGHT HERE.

40:34.585 --> 40:35.584
SCATTER MY ASHES.

40:36.921 --> 40:37.820
DONE.

40:37.856 --> 40:39.188
[LAUGHING]

40:39.224 --> 40:40.823
[PHONE RINGING]

40:40.892 --> 40:41.958
HEY, LOGAN.

40:42.026 --> 40:43.592
I WENT THROUGH THOSE NUMBERS,

40:43.661 --> 40:46.028
AND I FOUND
A PRETTY INTERESTING ONE.

40:46.097 --> 40:47.629
HOW INTERESTING?

40:47.698 --> 40:49.999
THE ANDRONICUS FAMILY LAWYER,

40:50.034 --> 40:51.100
ALLAN DEMETRY.

40:51.135 --> 40:53.369
I'LL TEXT YOU HIS NUMBER
AND ADDRESS.

40:53.404 --> 40:55.071
LOGAN, YOU ARE THE BEST.

40:55.139 --> 40:56.873
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

41:02.347 --> 41:03.279
[CRASHING]

41:09.120 --> 41:10.253
[DIALING]

41:10.288 --> 41:11.187
FRANK!

41:16.160 --> 41:19.828
NO, I JUST SAW A BODY
MOVING THROUGH THE STORE,

41:19.864 --> 41:20.897
SO I...

41:20.932 --> 41:21.898
YOU OKAY?

41:21.933 --> 41:23.099
OH, I'M FINE.

41:23.167 --> 41:24.633
WAS ANYTHING STOLEN?

41:24.668 --> 41:26.568
IT DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE THEY TOOK ANYTHING.

41:26.604 --> 41:27.937
OKAY.

41:27.972 --> 41:28.871
WELL, THIS IS GOOD.

41:28.907 --> 41:29.838
UH...

41:29.874 --> 41:30.940
BUT?

41:30.975 --> 41:32.474
LOOKS LIKE
THEY RETURNED SOMETHING.

41:36.147 --> 41:38.180
[FRANK]:
THE MISSING PUZZLE BOX?

41:38.249 --> 41:40.917
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU,
THAT WAS NOT THERE BEFORE.

41:40.985 --> 41:42.184
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY
STEAL IT

41:42.220 --> 41:43.319
AND THEN RETURN IT?

41:43.354 --> 41:45.554
I'M NOT SURE.

41:45.589 --> 41:47.656
WELL, I CAN DUST IT
FOR FINGERPRINTS,

41:47.691 --> 41:48.857
BUT IT'S NOT
TECHNICALLY EVIDENCE

41:48.927 --> 41:50.259
UNTIL WE CAN PROVE

41:50.295 --> 41:52.094
THAT IT'S TIED
TO EITHER DEATH.

41:52.163 --> 41:53.396
[OFFICER]:
DETECTIVE LYNWOOD?

41:53.464 --> 41:55.932
WHEN HE SAW US, HE RAN.

42:03.441 --> 42:05.274
AM I UNDER ARREST?

42:07.812 --> 42:10.846
YES, I'D SAY
A CHAT IS IN ORDER.

42:12.850 --> 42:14.250
[FRANK]: <i> WELL,</i>

42:14.285 --> 42:16.852
<i>THAT'S A LONG LIST</i>
<i>OF GREATEST HITS HERE.</i>

42:16.887 --> 42:18.120
<i>RIOTING,</i>

42:18.156 --> 42:20.923
A DROPPED ASSAULT CHARGE
ON A PEACE OFFICER...

42:20.959 --> 42:23.259
OH, AND BREAKING AND ENTERING.

42:23.294 --> 42:25.361
THERE WAS NO BREAKING
AND ENTERING.

42:25.396 --> 42:27.496
THAT CHARGE WAS
TRESPASSING AT MOST.

42:27.531 --> 42:28.364
HOW SO?

42:28.399 --> 42:29.698
I WAS PROTESTING

42:29.767 --> 42:32.768
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SKYSCRAPER
OVER IN ALDERGROVE.

42:32.837 --> 42:36.172
I WAS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY,
CLIMBED OVER A FENCE,

42:36.240 --> 42:39.175
AND GOT GRABBED FROM BEHIND
BY AN OFF-DUTY COP.

42:39.210 --> 42:42.211
DID YOU EVER STEAL ANYTHING
FROM MRS. SHANNON'S STORE...

42:42.246 --> 42:44.513
SPECIFICALLY, A PUZZLE BOX,

42:44.548 --> 42:46.849
<i>THEN FOR WHATEVER REASON</i>
<i>BRING IT BACK?</i>

42:46.917 --> 42:48.284
[PROTESTER]:
<i>NO.</i>

42:48.319 --> 42:51.020
<i>I'M NOT A THIEF,</i>
<i>OR ANYTHING THAT SHEET SAYS.</i>

42:51.055 --> 42:54.390
THE REAL CROOKS WEAR SUITS,
COME INTO SMALL TOWNS,

42:54.425 --> 42:56.225
BULLDOZE EVERYTHING IN SIGHT.

42:56.260 --> 42:59.161
HENCE THE ANDRONOCORP PROTEST,

42:59.230 --> 43:00.562
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS,

43:00.598 --> 43:02.664
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU SEEM FAIRLY ANGERED AT...

43:03.968 --> 43:07.203
I'D EVEN SAY
OBSESSED.

43:07.238 --> 43:09.705
"OBSESSED" IS A WORD
LAZY PEOPLE USE

43:09.773 --> 43:11.773
TO DESCRIBE THE DEDICATED.

43:11.809 --> 43:14.410
OOH, THAT'D BE A GREAT TAGLINE
FOR ONE OF YOUR SIGNS.

43:14.445 --> 43:16.645
OH, SPEAKING
OF TAGS,

43:16.680 --> 43:18.981
I'M GUESSING THAT
THE SPRAY-PAINT IN YOUR BAG

43:19.017 --> 43:20.149
AND WHAT YOU'VE GOT
ON YOUR HANDS THERE

43:20.184 --> 43:22.385
IS THE SAME
AS ON THE ANDRONICUS GATE.

43:22.420 --> 43:23.685
OH, AND I'VE EVEN HEARD ACCOUNTS

43:23.721 --> 43:26.955
<i>OF OTHER ANDRONOCORP BUILDINGS</i>
<i>BEING DEFACED</i>

43:26.991 --> 43:28.457
ALL OVER TOWN.

43:28.493 --> 43:30.493
IT IS WHAT IT IS,

43:30.528 --> 43:32.995
BUT I NEVER BROKE
INTO ANY STORE.

43:33.031 --> 43:35.864
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE
AT THE ANDRONICUS RESIDENCE?

43:40.204 --> 43:43.139
DID YOU SEE OR HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEATHS

43:43.174 --> 43:45.508
OF EITHER ELIZABETH
OR TAMARA ANDRONICUS?

43:45.576 --> 43:47.776
[PROTESTER]:
<i>NO,</i>

43:47.845 --> 43:50.279
<i>BUT THE FEWER OF THAT FAMILY</i>
<i>IN THIS WORLD,</i>

43:50.314 --> 43:51.747
<i>THE BETTER.</i>

43:51.782 --> 43:54.383
[FRANK]: <i> IF YOU'RE WITHHOLDING,</i>
<i>IT'S OBSTRUCTION.</i>

43:58.122 --> 44:00.389
I WAS TAGGING THEIR GATE.

44:00.458 --> 44:02.024
I SAW A CAR
SPEED INTO THE DRIVEWAY

44:02.093 --> 44:04.093
AND SLAM ON ITS BRAKES.

44:04.128 --> 44:05.994
A WOMAN CAME OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

44:06.030 --> 44:08.964
<i>I TOOK OFF</i>
<i>BEFORE HE GOT OUT OF THE CAR.</i>

44:08.999 --> 44:09.798
[FRANK]:
<i>DID YOU HEAR WHAT THEY SAID?</i>

44:09.867 --> 44:10.866
NO.

44:10.901 --> 44:12.168
WAS THE WOMAN
OLDER OR YOUNGER?

44:12.203 --> 44:13.169
YOUNGER.

44:13.204 --> 44:15.538
AND THE DRIVER?

44:15.573 --> 44:17.339
LIKE I SAID, NEVER SAW HIM.

44:17.375 --> 44:18.774
WHAT ABOUT THE CAR?

44:18.809 --> 44:23.045
UH, SILVER... GRAY... SEDAN?

44:23.081 --> 44:24.480
AND THIS WAS YESTERDAY?

44:24.515 --> 44:26.815
YEAH.

44:26.850 --> 44:29.452
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO
TO THE POLICE?

44:29.487 --> 44:31.753
'CAUSE I KNEW
YOU'D SEE THOSE PRIORS,

44:31.789 --> 44:33.722
AND I'D END UP
NEVER WALKING OUT OF HERE.

44:33.757 --> 44:36.425
<i>LOOK...</i>

44:36.461 --> 44:38.860
<i>I KNOW I HAVE RED ON MY HANDS..</i>

44:40.898 --> 44:42.898
BUT NONE OF IT'S BLOOD.

44:46.167 --> 44:47.769
BUT IF ZACH BROKE
INTO THE STORE,

44:47.819 --> 44:48.718
WOULDN'T HE HAVE
AN INJURED LEG

44:48.787 --> 44:50.153
FROM THE FALL?

44:50.189 --> 44:52.021
TRUE, BUT HE COULD JUST
BE LYING ABOUT THE ARGUMENT

44:52.057 --> 44:53.823
TO COVER UP
FOR HIMSELF.

44:53.858 --> 44:54.924
HE WAS THERE

44:54.959 --> 44:57.760
AROUND THE TIME
OF TAMARA'S DEATH.

44:57.796 --> 45:00.230
NO, JUST BECAUSE
HE'S PASSIONATE ABOUT A CAUSE

45:00.299 --> 45:01.631
DOESN'T MEAN HE'S A KILLER.

45:01.667 --> 45:03.633
OKAY, THEN WHO?

45:03.702 --> 45:04.834
I FOUND A NUMBER

45:04.869 --> 45:07.036
FOR THE ANDRONICUS
FAMILY LAWYER,

45:07.105 --> 45:08.771
THE SAME NUMBER
THAT TEXTED TAMARA

45:08.807 --> 45:10.207
SAYING, "I'M SORRY."

45:10.242 --> 45:11.941
ALLAN DEMETRY
WAS THE "I'M SORRY?"

45:11.976 --> 45:13.610
HE WAS.

45:13.645 --> 45:14.944
MAYBE QUIN WAS ON TO SOMETHING

45:14.979 --> 45:18.315
WHEN HE SAID DEMETRY
WAS INTERESTED IN TAMARA.

45:18.350 --> 45:19.816
WELL, IF WE CAN
EVEN FIND DEMETRY

45:19.884 --> 45:21.284
AND GET THE CELL,

45:21.353 --> 45:22.586
THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO APPROXIMATE

45:22.654 --> 45:24.787
THE AREA
WHERE HE MADE THAT TEXT FROM.

45:24.823 --> 45:26.089
WHICH WOULD PUT HIM
AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME,

45:26.124 --> 45:27.056
OR SOMEWHERE ELSE.

45:27.092 --> 45:28.024
WELL, THIS GUY,

45:28.059 --> 45:29.292
HE HASN'T RETURNED
ANY OF MY CALLS,

45:29.328 --> 45:30.493
HASN'T SHOWN UP AT WORK,

45:30.529 --> 45:31.695
AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS SAY

45:31.730 --> 45:32.562
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN HIS CAR
IN THE DRIVEWAY

45:32.598 --> 45:33.597
SINCE TUESDAY.

45:33.665 --> 45:35.932
YOU GOT ANYTHING
ON TAMARA'S CELL?

45:35.967 --> 45:37.800
NO,
STILL WAITING ON A WARRANT.

45:37.869 --> 45:40.237
CAN'T LUCAS GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO ACCESS HER PHONE?

45:40.305 --> 45:41.771
I WISH IT WAS THAT EASY.

45:41.806 --> 45:43.440
DETECTIVE, THE BOX
HAS BEEN WIPED DOWN.

45:43.475 --> 45:44.874
NO FINGERPRINTS.

45:47.479 --> 45:48.612
YOU THINKING
THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE,

45:48.647 --> 45:50.113
THAT'S PERTAINING
TO THE INVESTIGATION?

45:50.181 --> 45:52.148
I'M NOT SURE,

45:52.183 --> 45:53.617
BUT IF YOU WANT ME
TO STAY WITH IT AND GET IT OPEN,

45:53.652 --> 45:54.651
I CAN FIND OUT.

45:56.121 --> 45:57.019
GIVE IT TO HER.

45:59.958 --> 46:01.291
COME TO ME FIRST.

46:01.360 --> 46:02.959
I ALWAYS DO.

46:02.994 --> 46:04.193
AH.

46:04.263 --> 46:05.295
YEAH, RIGHT.

46:20.879 --> 46:22.178
HEY, DANI.

46:22.247 --> 46:23.946
CAN YOU COVER FOR ME
AT THE STORE TOMORROW MORNING?

46:23.982 --> 46:25.482
[BARKING]

46:25.517 --> 46:26.849
[LOGAN]: COPPER!
MITTENS!

46:26.885 --> 46:27.784
LL DROOL J, COME ON.

46:27.819 --> 46:28.752
[BARKING]

46:31.356 --> 46:33.490
DID YOU OPEN UP
A DOG PARK IN OUR BACKYARD?

46:33.525 --> 46:34.791
[BARKING]

46:34.826 --> 46:36.225
YEAH, IT WAS SUPPOSED

46:36.261 --> 46:37.527
TO BE A DOG-WALKING
BUSINESS. I...

46:37.562 --> 46:38.595
[BARKING]

46:38.630 --> 46:39.663
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE EASIER.

46:41.533 --> 46:42.499
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE END GOAL

46:42.534 --> 46:43.800
IS GETTING FARTHER
AND FARTHER AWAY.

46:43.835 --> 46:45.769
DON'T WORRY,
YOU'LL GET THERE.

46:45.804 --> 46:47.437
ANYTHING WORTHWHILE TAKES TIME.

46:48.507 --> 46:49.372
YOU THINK SO?

46:49.408 --> 46:50.540
I KNOW SO.

58:06.279 --> 58:07.411
CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR

58:07.446 --> 58:08.946
AND RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON JOEL JACOBS,

58:08.982 --> 58:10.782
THAT PRODUCER FROM THE STORE?

58:10.817 --> 58:12.716
HE STARTED LIMPING
RIGHT AFTER THE BREAK-IN,

58:12.752 --> 58:14.852
AND HE WAS THE LAST PERSON
TO TOUCH THE PUZZLE BOX

58:14.921 --> 58:16.720
BEFORE IT WENT MISSING.

58:16.756 --> 58:18.622
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE THERE'S A CONNECTION.

58:18.658 --> 58:19.523
I'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU LATER.

58:19.558 --> 58:20.958
BYE.

58:22.061 --> 58:22.927
I'M ASSUMING
YOU'RE JENN?

58:24.230 --> 58:25.163
I AM.

58:25.198 --> 58:26.330
QUIN.

58:26.365 --> 58:28.465
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

58:32.605 --> 58:34.238
YOUR MOTHER'S WORK
WAS SO INTRICATE.

58:34.274 --> 58:36.974
SHE WAS THE BEST...

58:37.010 --> 58:38.442
AT EVERYTHING.

58:40.213 --> 58:42.046
I WAS SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT HER PASSING,

58:42.081 --> 58:43.114
AND LUCAS' ARREST.

58:44.483 --> 58:45.582
THEY ARRESTED HIM?

58:45.618 --> 58:46.550
ON WHAT?

58:46.585 --> 58:48.452
ASSAULT.

58:48.487 --> 58:49.821
I'M SORRY,
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

58:51.390 --> 58:52.423
WAS IT ALLAN DEMETRY?

58:53.993 --> 58:55.092
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

58:56.329 --> 58:57.661
IF YOU SAW THE WAY
DEMETRY LOOKED AT TAMARA,

58:57.697 --> 58:59.797
YOU'D KNOW THERE WAS
ALWAYS SOMETHING THERE.

58:59.833 --> 59:00.998
LUCAS JUST NEVER SAW IT,

59:01.034 --> 59:02.200
OR MAYBE HE DIDN'T WANT TO.

59:05.371 --> 59:06.804
NOT MEANING TO PRY...

59:06.840 --> 59:07.905
PRY AWAY.

59:07.941 --> 59:10.541
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO LUCAS?

59:10.576 --> 59:12.776
UH, WELL...

59:12.812 --> 59:13.811
HAVEN'T SPOKEN
TO HIM MUCH

59:13.880 --> 59:15.512
IN THE LAST YEAR.

59:15.548 --> 59:17.514
I DID SPEAK TO MY MOM
EVERY DAY.

59:17.550 --> 59:18.415
I WAS TALKING
TO HER FRIDAY

59:18.451 --> 59:20.517
WHEN THE CALL DROPPED.

59:20.553 --> 59:21.919
I TRIED TO PHONE BACK,
BUT THERE WAS NO ANSWER,

59:21.988 --> 59:24.722
AND THEN I REACHED
OUT TO LUCAS.

59:24.757 --> 59:25.923
HE HADN'T HEARD
FROM HER EITHER,

59:25.959 --> 59:27.892
SO...

59:27.961 --> 59:29.360
WHEN NONE OF
MY TEXTS, EMAILS,

59:29.428 --> 59:30.394
OR CALLS WERE RETURNED,

59:30.429 --> 59:31.562
I DECIDED TO FLY HOME,

59:31.597 --> 59:34.932
AND THAT'S WHEN I SAW
TAMARA AND DEMETRY.

59:34.968 --> 59:36.467
DID YOU TELL LUCAS
WHAT YOU SAW?

59:36.502 --> 59:37.735
I DID.

59:37.770 --> 59:39.871
NOW I'M GUESSING MY CALL
ALONG WITH MOM'S SILENCE

59:39.906 --> 59:40.872
MADE HIM FLY OUT.

59:40.940 --> 59:43.040
DO YOU THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE

59:43.076 --> 59:44.408
THAT LUCAS COULD HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO

59:44.443 --> 59:45.709
WITH TAMARA'S DEATH?

59:45.778 --> 59:48.746
I DON'T THINK HE'D HURT
THE ONE PERSON HE LOVED

59:48.781 --> 59:50.381
MORE THAN HIMSELF.

59:52.752 --> 59:54.919
YOU KNOW THE WORST PART?

59:54.954 --> 59:56.954
I'M NOT EVEN SAD SHE'S GONE.

59:56.990 --> 59:58.022
[SIGHING]

59:58.091 --> 59:59.456
OH, I'M SORRY, I'M...

59:59.492 --> 01:00:00.424
INQUISITIVE.
IT'S FINE.

01:00:00.459 --> 01:00:01.425
I'M THE SAME WAY.

01:00:01.494 --> 01:00:02.860
I JUST NEED SOME
TIME TO REFOCUS.

01:00:02.896 --> 01:00:04.095
OF COURSE.

01:00:07.267 --> 01:00:08.699
DO YOU KNOW
THE PATTERN?

01:00:10.636 --> 01:00:12.436
NO, BUT I KNOW
THE SYMBOLS,

01:00:12.505 --> 01:00:14.038
AND I KNOW THE WAY
SHE THOUGHT.

01:00:14.073 --> 01:00:16.908
WHATEVER MOM WAS HIDING
MUST'VE BEEN IMPORTANT.

01:00:16.943 --> 01:00:18.842
HIDING FROM WHO?

01:00:18.878 --> 01:00:21.578
I DON'T KNOW...
YET...

01:00:21.614 --> 01:00:23.747
BUT THIS SPIRAL
DRAWN THIS WAY

01:00:23.783 --> 01:00:25.416
MEANS "FAMILY",

01:00:25.484 --> 01:00:27.018
BUT IF YOU TAKE
THE SAME SYMBOL

01:00:27.086 --> 01:00:28.286
AND TURN IT
UPSIDE DOWN,

01:00:28.321 --> 01:00:29.787
THEN IT MEANS "DANGER."

01:00:31.224 --> 01:00:33.257
IT'S LIKE SHE WAS SENDING US
RIDDLES FROM THE GRAVE.

01:00:33.293 --> 01:00:36.193
ALMOST LIKE SHE KNEW
SHE WAS IN DANGER?

01:00:37.297 --> 01:00:39.297
THESE TWO TEAR SYMBOLS...

01:00:39.332 --> 01:00:40.631
IF YOU PUT THEM
SIDE-BY-SIDE,

01:00:40.699 --> 01:00:42.866
THEY BECOME
THE INFINITY SIGN.

01:00:42.902 --> 01:00:44.101
COUPLED
WITH THE SWIRL FOR "FAMILY"

01:00:44.137 --> 01:00:45.002
AND THE GREEK VERB FOR "IS,"

01:00:45.071 --> 01:00:46.370
IT BECOMES...

01:00:46.406 --> 01:00:48.639
[TOGETHER]:
"FAMILY IS FOREVER."

01:00:52.145 --> 01:00:53.110
I'M SORRY.

01:00:53.179 --> 01:00:55.313
UH, I HAVE TO GO.

01:00:55.348 --> 01:00:57.081
IF YOU'D LIKE,

01:00:57.116 --> 01:00:59.250
I COULD TAKE IT AND
WORK ON IT TONIGHT.

01:00:59.319 --> 01:01:00.651
WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'D LIKE TO HANG ON TO IT,

01:01:00.686 --> 01:01:02.286
BUT MAYBE I COULD
COME BY TOMORROW?

01:01:02.322 --> 01:01:04.422
SURE.

01:01:04.457 --> 01:01:06.890
JUST BE CAREFUL.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:07.825
THE LAST PEOPLE
TO TOUCH IT

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:08.960
TURNED UP DEAD.

01:01:20.539 --> 01:01:22.706

01:01:22.741 --> 01:01:23.874

01:01:23.943 --> 01:01:25.576
DEMETRY LET US PING HIS CELL,

01:01:25.611 --> 01:01:26.877
WHICH GAVE US THE LOCATION

01:01:26.912 --> 01:01:28.512
OF WHERE HE SENT
THE "I'M SORRY" TEXT.

01:01:28.547 --> 01:01:29.847
<i>WHERE WAS HE?</i>

01:01:29.882 --> 01:01:31.182
HE WAS AT HOME,

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.017
AN HOUR AWAY
FROM THE ANDRONICUS HOUSE.

01:01:33.052 --> 01:01:34.685
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING ON JOEL?

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.120

01:01:47.467 --> 01:01:49.066
WELL, YEAH.

01:01:49.102 --> 01:01:51.502
JOEL MIGHT HAVE GONE OVER
TO ASK FOR SOME CASH.

01:01:51.537 --> 01:01:53.037
SOMEHOW, THINGS GET HEATED.

01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:55.973
WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM MOTIVATION
TO KILL EITHER ONE OF THEM.

01:01:56.009 --> 01:01:57.341
IF QUIN'S ALIBI HOLDS,

01:01:57.377 --> 01:01:59.510

THAT JOEL COULD HAVE KILLED
ELIZABETH FOR MONEY,

01:02:05.818 --> 01:02:08.386
AND LUCAS KILLED TAMARA
OUT OF A JEALOUS RAGE?

01:02:08.421 --> 01:02:09.686

TWO DIFFERENT KILLERS?

01:02:09.722 --> 01:02:10.921
<i>MAYBE...</i>

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:20.757

I'VE ANSWERED.

01:02:20.826 --> 01:02:23.127
WELL, MAYBE I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW.

01:02:23.162 --> 01:02:24.928

WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR

01:02:24.963 --> 01:02:26.296
FOR A WHILE,

01:02:26.332 --> 01:02:29.633
SOMETHING YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY ASSUMED WAS GOING ON,

01:02:29.668 --> 01:02:33.170
WHICH LED YOU RIGHT OVER
TO ASSAULT ALLAN DEMETRY.

01:02:33.205 --> 01:02:35.472
I ASSUME YOUR SHIRT
GOT RIPPED IN THAT FIGHT

01:02:35.508 --> 01:02:38.108
AND NOT IN THE CAR DOOR
LIKE YOU ORIGINALLY TOLD ME.

01:02:38.177 --> 01:02:39.976
I WAS LYING BEFORE.

01:02:40.012 --> 01:02:40.977
NOT NOW.

01:02:41.013 --> 01:02:42.379
AND AFTER THE FIGHT,

01:02:42.415 --> 01:02:44.515
WELL, YOU WERE FEELING
RILED UP,

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.016
SO YOU WENT BACK HOME

01:02:46.052 --> 01:02:47.617
AND SETTLED THE SCORE
WITH YOUR WIFE.

01:02:47.653 --> 01:02:49.019

01:02:49.055 --> 01:02:50.954

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.268
SO YOU TOOK IT BACK FROM HIM,
RIGHT?

01:03:04.303 --> 01:03:07.237
'CAUSE IF YOU CAN'T HAVE HER,
NEITHER CAN HE.

01:03:07.273 --> 01:03:08.372

BEING SO DEATHLY ALLERGIC TO IT?

FOR IT BACK THEN,

01:05:48.434 --> 01:05:51.167

YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

01:07:13.752 --> 01:07:15.652
I WAS CUTTING SOME
FOOTAGE LAST NIGHT,

01:07:15.688 --> 01:07:17.754

COMING TOGETHER.

ABOUT THIS TOWN

01:07:35.941 --> 01:07:36.873

GREW UP HERE.

WOULD TRUST OR HIRE ME.

ON THE LINE,

BUT I BROKE
UNDER THE PRESSURE.

01:12:53.812 --> 01:12:54.911
I THOUGHT

01:12:54.946 --> 01:12:56.680
THAT A MYSTERIOUS BOX
GOING MISSING

01:12:56.715 --> 01:12:58.047
WOULD BE GREAT
FOR THE EPISODE,

01:12:58.116 --> 01:12:59.783
THAT IT WOULD HEIGHTEN
THE TENSION,

01:12:59.818 --> 01:13:02.319
BUT THEN IT GOT
INVOLVED IN A MURDER...

01:13:02.354 --> 01:13:04.287
AND I'M GUESSING
YOU PANICKED

01:13:04.323 --> 01:13:05.422

01:13:15.534 --> 01:13:16.833
AND WE'LL LEAVE
BY TONIGHT.

01:13:16.901 --> 01:13:19.703
YOU RISKED EVERYTHING
FOR RATINGS?

01:13:19.738 --> 01:13:22.472
[FRANK]:
WELL, JOEL WAS SAYING

01:13:22.507 --> 01:13:24.173
THAT YOU AND THE CREW
WERE WORKING TOGETHER

01:13:24.209 --> 01:13:25.575
DURING THE NIGHTS
OF BOTH DEATHS.

01:13:25.644 --> 01:13:26.509
IS THAT TRUE?

01:13:26.545 --> 01:13:28.878
YEAH.

01:13:28.913 --> 01:13:30.880
I WAS WITH HIM BOTH NIGHTS.

01:13:30.915 --> 01:13:32.949
I'M SURE THE REST OF THE CREW
CAN VERIFY THAT.

01:13:32.984 --> 01:13:33.983
JENN?

01:13:34.052 --> 01:13:36.052
ARE WE PRESSING CHARGES?

01:13:38.323 --> 01:13:39.188
DO YOU HAVE
ENOUGH FOOTAGE

01:13:39.257 --> 01:13:40.390
TO FINISH THE SHOW?

01:13:42.561 --> 01:13:44.160
WELL, I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN THE BOX

01:13:44.195 --> 01:13:46.062
TO MAKE THE EPISODE WORK.

01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.968
WELL, IT'S NOT WORTH
LOSING YOUR HOUSE OVER.

01:13:52.036 --> 01:13:53.336
NO, I THINK
WE CAN TRY

01:13:53.372 --> 01:13:55.104
TO FIGURE OUT
THE FINAL CIPHER.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.307
WAIT A MINUTE... REALLY?

01:13:58.377 --> 01:13:59.743
[FRANK]:
SO WE'RE ALL GOOD?

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.713
YES, FRANK,
THANK YOU.

01:14:03.749 --> 01:14:05.181
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

01:14:09.755 --> 01:14:12.722
KAT, I'M REALLY...
I'M SORRY...

01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:13.757
BUT I DO THINK

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.525
THAT WE CAN MAKE
THIS WORK.

01:14:18.029 --> 01:14:19.028
LET'S DO THIS.

01:14:21.266 --> 01:14:22.399
OKAY, CAMERA'S UP.

01:14:22.434 --> 01:14:24.467
[CREW]:
SOUND SPEED.

01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:25.769
ACTION WHEN YOU'RE
READY, JENN.

01:14:25.804 --> 01:14:26.736
TALK US THROUGH IT.

01:14:26.772 --> 01:14:28.538
OKAY.

01:14:28.573 --> 01:14:29.739
WELL, RIGHT HERE,

01:14:29.775 --> 01:14:32.942
WE HAVE THE COMBINATION
FOR "FAMILY IS FOREVER,"

01:14:32.977 --> 01:14:34.511
BUT THIS SYMBOL
UPSIDE-DOWN

01:14:34.546 --> 01:14:36.279
MEANS "DANGER,"

01:14:36.314 --> 01:14:37.647
SO MAYBE
WHAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY

01:14:37.716 --> 01:14:40.750
IS NOTHING
IS AS IT SEEMS.

01:14:40.786 --> 01:14:42.318
EVERYTHING IS UPSIDE DOWN.

01:14:50.762 --> 01:14:52.061
SO NOW, IF I...

01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:54.330
IF I ALIGN THE SYMBOL
WITH "DANGER"

01:14:54.399 --> 01:14:56.299
AND THE SYMBOL FOR "HOME,"

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:57.500
AND I SLIDE OVER THE SYMBOL
FOR "IN,"

01:14:57.536 --> 01:14:59.101
WELL, THEN I HAVE...

01:14:59.137 --> 01:15:01.037
I HAVE,
"HOME IN DANGER."

01:15:03.141 --> 01:15:04.040
[UNLOCKING]

01:15:04.075 --> 01:15:05.007
OH!

01:15:09.347 --> 01:15:10.379
IT'S EMPTY.

01:15:10.449 --> 01:15:11.648
THERE'S NOTHING
IN IT.

01:15:13.251 --> 01:15:16.152
WAIT A MINUTE.

01:15:16.187 --> 01:15:18.054
THE ANSWER IS NOT IN THE BOX.

01:15:18.089 --> 01:15:19.823
THE ANSWER IS THE BOX.

01:15:19.858 --> 01:15:21.390
WHY...

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:22.425
IF YOU LOOK INSIDE,

01:15:22.461 --> 01:15:24.393
THESE LINES
AND THE COLORS,

01:15:24.429 --> 01:15:26.496
THIS IS A PLACE.

01:15:26.531 --> 01:15:28.364
IT'S A ROOM,

01:15:28.433 --> 01:15:30.533
AND I'VE BEEN THERE.

01:15:34.639 --> 01:15:35.705
UH, JENN...

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:37.440
DON'T WORRY,
I'M CALLING FRANK.

01:15:38.543 --> 01:15:40.409
[LUCAS]:
SO YOU'VE REALLY SOLVED IT?

01:15:40.445 --> 01:15:41.210
ALMOST.

01:15:57.529 --> 01:15:58.595
LOOK FAMILIAR?

01:16:01.533 --> 01:16:04.233
IT'S AN EXACT RE-CREATION
OF THIS LIBRARY.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:05.267
YES, SHE HID
HER MESSAGE

01:16:05.303 --> 01:16:07.203
IN THE PUZZLE BOX,

01:16:07.238 --> 01:16:09.973
SO THE CLUES ARE
PROBABLY IN THIS ROOM.

01:16:10.008 --> 01:16:11.708
THEY MAY BE
ON THE WALLS

01:16:11.743 --> 01:16:13.075
OR IN THE WALLS.

01:16:17.115 --> 01:16:18.915
WHAT MESSAGE?

01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:20.082
THE INFINITY SIGN.

01:16:20.118 --> 01:16:22.051
THAT MEANS FOREVER...

01:16:23.889 --> 01:16:25.855
AND THAT'S THE GREEK SYMBOL
FOR "IS."

01:16:27.659 --> 01:16:29.692
YES, OF COURSE.

01:16:29.728 --> 01:16:31.027
THE FAMILY PORTRAIT.

01:16:31.062 --> 01:16:32.562
"FAMILY."

01:16:32.597 --> 01:16:33.796
THAT'S ONE OF
THE EARLY CIPHERS.

01:16:33.865 --> 01:16:34.731
"FAMILY IS..."

01:16:34.766 --> 01:16:36.533
FOREVER.

01:16:36.568 --> 01:16:38.167
SHE ALWAYS SAID THAT.

01:16:41.573 --> 01:16:43.172
"WE MUST LEARN
TO LIVE TOGETHER AS BROTHERS

01:16:43.207 --> 01:16:45.909
OR PERISH TOGETHER AS FOOLS."

01:16:45.944 --> 01:16:47.410
THAT WAS DEFINITELY HER.

01:16:47.478 --> 01:16:48.511
NO, NO, NO,
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.

01:16:48.547 --> 01:16:49.579
THERE HAS TO BE MORE.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:13.169
IT'S A LETTER
FROM YOUR MOTHER.

01:17:14.238 --> 01:17:15.104
[GUN CLICKS]

01:17:20.974 --> 01:17:21.974
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:17:22.024 --> 01:17:23.958
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT SHE KNOWS.

01:17:23.993 --> 01:17:24.859
MR. ANDRONICUS...

01:17:26.696 --> 01:17:28.296
DETECTIVE LYNWOOD
IS ON HIS WAY.

01:17:28.331 --> 01:17:30.398
WHY DO YOU HAVE
A GUN?

01:17:31.668 --> 01:17:33.033
SHE'S GOING TO TELL US.

01:17:33.069 --> 01:17:34.001
GO.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.174
I THINK IT STARTED
ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

01:17:40.209 --> 01:17:43.444
WHEN LUCAS AND TAMARA
CUT OFF CONTACT FROM QUIN

01:17:43.513 --> 01:17:46.447
BECAUSE OF THE FIGHT
AND THE RESTRAINING ORDER.

01:17:46.483 --> 01:17:48.916
QUIN THOUGHT TAMARA
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:51.018
LUCAS DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN.

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:54.989
READ THE LETTER.

01:17:57.827 --> 01:18:01.829
ELIZABETH SAW ALLAN DEMETRY
AND TAMARA

01:18:01.864 --> 01:18:03.798
EARLY FRIDAY MORNING.

01:18:06.235 --> 01:18:08.002
TAMARA COULD ONLY ASSUME

01:18:08.037 --> 01:18:11.071
THAT ELIZABETH'S NEXT PHONE CALL
WOULD BE TO LUCAS...

01:18:13.209 --> 01:18:15.576
A PHONE CALL
THAT WOULD LEAVE HER

01:18:15.612 --> 01:18:18.513
PREPARING FOR A MESSY DIVORCE,

01:18:18.548 --> 01:18:19.647
LOSING MONEY AND STOCK

01:18:19.683 --> 01:18:22.249
IN A VERY VALUABLE
REAL-ESTATE COMPANY...

01:18:23.386 --> 01:18:25.119
AND SHE COULDN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

01:18:28.057 --> 01:18:31.158
QUIN'S REPEATED ATTEMPTS
TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ELIZABETH

01:18:31.194 --> 01:18:32.460
GO UNANSWERED,

01:18:32.495 --> 01:18:34.562
SO HE FLIES HERE
SATURDAY MORNING

01:18:34.597 --> 01:18:35.763
TO CHECK ON HER...

01:18:35.832 --> 01:18:38.098
ONLY WHEN HE ARRIVES,

01:18:38.134 --> 01:18:39.900
HE SEES ALLAN LEAVING THE HOUSE

01:18:39.936 --> 01:18:41.436
IN THE EARLY HOURS
OF THE MORNING.

01:18:41.504 --> 01:18:42.470
HE CAN'T CONFRONT TAMARA

01:18:42.505 --> 01:18:44.839
BECAUSE OF
THE RESTRAINING ORDER,

01:18:44.907 --> 01:18:48.075
SO HE CALLS YOU, LUCAS,
OVERSEAS, ABOUT DEMETRY,

01:18:48.144 --> 01:18:50.244
HOPING THIS TIME,
YOU WILL BELIEVE HIM.

01:18:52.215 --> 01:18:54.482
TO KEEP ELIZABETH FURTHER
CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD...

01:18:56.252 --> 01:18:57.952
TAMARA FIRES
THE REST OF THE STAFF

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.887
ON SATURDAY.

01:18:59.956 --> 01:19:03.257
ELIZABETH KNOWS
THAT SHE HAS TO HIDE HER MESSAGE

01:19:03.292 --> 01:19:06.927
IN A PLACE THAT TAMARA
WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND.

01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:10.398
SHE PUTS THE CLUES
IN THE PUZZLE BOX,

01:19:10.433 --> 01:19:11.198
HOPING THAT QUIN
WILL BE ABLE TO SOLVE THEM.

01:19:13.503 --> 01:19:15.536
KNOWING YOU BOTH WILL BE HOME
EVENTUALLY...

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.539
TAMARA KNOWS
SHE HAS TO GET RID OF ELIZABETH

01:19:18.575 --> 01:19:21.609
AND COVER HER TRACKS...

01:19:21.678 --> 01:19:25.246
AND WITH ELIZABETH'S
FAILING HEALTH,

01:19:25.281 --> 01:19:27.882
SHE HOPES IT WILL LOOK
LIKE NATURAL CAUSES

01:19:27.917 --> 01:19:29.817
INSTEAD OF AN ALLERGIC REACTION
TO PEANUT RESIDUE

01:19:29.853 --> 01:19:33.755
OR VAPORS THAT ARE UNTRACEABLE
IN AN AUTOPSY.

01:19:33.823 --> 01:19:36.957
LUCAS, YOU ARRIVE HOME
ON SUNDAY NIGHT

01:19:36.993 --> 01:19:39.059
TO FIND ELIZABETH DEAD...

01:19:39.095 --> 01:19:40.928
BUT SOMETHING DOESN'T SIT RIGHT.

01:19:46.369 --> 01:19:48.235
MAYBE THERE'S TRUTH

01:19:48.271 --> 01:19:49.737
IN WHAT QUIN
HAS BEEN TELLING YOU.

01:19:49.773 --> 01:19:51.672
I, I... I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS UPSTAIRS.

01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:53.574
I JUST...
I CAME DOWN, AND I...

01:19:53.610 --> 01:19:56.176
[JENN]: TAMARA, OF COURSE,
DENIES THE AFFAIR...

01:19:56.212 --> 01:19:57.512
[CRASHING]

01:19:57.547 --> 01:19:58.446
TEXT HER, RIGHT NOW!

01:19:58.481 --> 01:19:59.447
OKAY, OKAY.

01:19:59.482 --> 01:20:00.648
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT NOW.

01:20:00.717 --> 01:20:02.149
LOOK, I'M GOING TO DO IT, OKAY?

01:20:02.184 --> 01:20:03.618
[JENN]: YOU CONFRONT
ALLAN DEMETRY,

01:20:03.653 --> 01:20:05.787
AND HE CONFESSES IMMEDIATELY.

01:20:05.822 --> 01:20:08.489
YOU THREATEN HIM.

01:20:08.525 --> 01:20:10.625
YOU TELL HIM TO BREAK IT OFF

ABOUT ELIZABETH'S DEATH

01:20:16.533 --> 01:20:17.498
AND POSSIBLY THE AFFAIR

01:20:17.567 --> 01:20:20.668
FROM LUCAS...

01:20:20.703 --> 01:20:23.103

THE NEXT FLIGHT HOME,

DID ELIZABETH SEE
YOU TWO TOGETHER?

01:20:37.186 --> 01:20:38.453
DID YOU TAKE HER
FROM ME?

I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:20:39.923 --> 01:20:41.622
OH, YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO LOOK ME IN THE FACE

01:20:41.691 --> 01:20:44.325

I LOVE HER.

TO BE HARD FOR ALL OF US,

01:22:39.776 --> 01:22:41.809
FAMILY IS FOREVER.

01:22:43.279 --> 01:22:44.545
WE CAN MAKE IT RIGHT.

01:22:55.257 --> 01:22:56.190
WELCOME!

01:22:56.225 --> 01:22:57.324
HELLO.

01:22:57.359 --> 01:22:58.258
-HI, SALLY.
-HOW ARE YOU?

01:22:58.294 --> 01:22:59.526
OH, IT'S A HECTIC WEEK.

01:22:59.562 --> 01:23:01.462
WELL, "STRESSED" IS "DESSERTS"
SPELLED BACKWARDS

01:23:01.497 --> 01:23:03.497
AND THERE IS NOTHING
THAT DESSERT CAN'T FIX.

01:23:03.532 --> 01:23:05.099
THAT IS MY MOTTO.

01:23:05.134 --> 01:23:07.234
I'LL JUST TAKE THAT THROUGH
TO THE KITCHEN...

01:23:07.303 --> 01:23:08.168
IF IT MAKES IT THERE.

01:23:08.204 --> 01:23:09.203
YEAH.

01:23:09.271 --> 01:23:10.137
SO?

01:23:10.172 --> 01:23:11.872
SO...

01:23:11.908 --> 01:23:14.108
SIGNED CONFESSION
FROM HARVEY.

01:23:14.143 --> 01:23:16.577
THE BROTHERS ARE TALKING AGAIN,

01:23:16.613 --> 01:23:18.345
AND, WELL,
QUIN HAS CONVINCED LUCAS

01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.180
TO COMPLY WITH MAIN STREET'S
BUILDING HEIGHT CODES.

01:23:20.216 --> 01:23:21.816
HUH.

01:23:21.884 --> 01:23:23.283
GREAT JOB AS ALWAYS, JENN.

01:23:23.352 --> 01:23:25.319
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

01:23:25.354 --> 01:23:27.454
OH, I MADE YOUR FAVORITE DISH.

01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:28.355
HONEY GARLIC RIBS?

01:23:29.659 --> 01:23:30.825
OKAY, YOUR SECOND FAVORITE.

01:23:32.895 --> 01:23:34.528
IS IT WEIRD
THAT OUR FIRST ACTUAL DATE

01:23:34.563 --> 01:23:38.165
IS MEETING
MY ENTIRE FAMILY?

01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.567
TOTALLY...

01:23:40.603 --> 01:23:41.702
BUT I'M IN.

01:23:42.872 --> 01:23:44.105
[LOGAN]:
AND I'M DONE.

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.674
HEY, I KNEW
YOU COULD DO IT.

01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:48.442
YOUR DAD AND I
WANT YOU TO KNOW

01:23:48.477 --> 01:23:49.409
THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD

01:23:49.445 --> 01:23:50.911
THAT YOU REACHED
YOUR GOAL.

01:23:50.947 --> 01:23:52.212
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
YOUR BIGGEST FANS.

01:23:52.248 --> 01:23:53.247
AND NOW,

01:23:53.315 --> 01:23:54.882
WE'RE YOUR
BIGGEST BUYERS.

01:23:54.951 --> 01:23:56.117
WE WANT YOU TO GROW UP,

01:23:56.152 --> 01:23:58.085
BUT YOUR PAST IS A BIG PART
OF WHO YOU ARE.

01:23:58.121 --> 01:23:59.053
IT'S NOT ALL THERE...

01:23:59.088 --> 01:24:00.154
[JASON]:
JUST ENOUGH.

01:24:00.189 --> 01:24:01.455
SWEET.

01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:02.456
THANKS.

01:24:02.491 --> 01:24:03.924
[TIMER CHIMING]

01:24:03.993 --> 01:24:05.860
OH, IT'S ON!

01:24:05.895 --> 01:24:06.994
IT'S ALL HAPPENING!

01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:08.763
[JENN]:
A STAR IS BORN.

01:24:08.798 --> 01:24:11.365
I WILL BE SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS
AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATION.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:12.499
ARE YOU GOING TO REMEMBER
US LITTLE PEOPLE

01:24:12.535 --> 01:24:13.901
NOW THAT
YOU'RE BIG AND FAMOUS?

01:24:13.936 --> 01:24:15.169
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?
