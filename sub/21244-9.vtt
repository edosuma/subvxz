♪♪

00:04.580 --> 00:06.170
Previously...

00:06.170 --> 00:07.960
The Other Side is negotiating
to buy the plans

00:07.960 --> 00:10.250
for a treacherous new weapon
with the secret code name

00:10.250 --> 00:12.080
Storm Maker.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.420
It's satellite-based,
and can cause

00:14.420 --> 00:16.920
catastrophic man-made
weather disasters.

00:16.920 --> 00:19.670
KC had to steal the plans
for some weather thingy.

00:19.670 --> 00:22.500
- Now she's hiding 'em in her locker.
- Really?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.830
The plans that were
in my locker, they're gone.

00:24.830 --> 00:26.540
It's done.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.540
Marisa's still clueless.

00:28.540 --> 00:31.040
Operation Storm Maker
can proceed.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.920
This is gonna be
a game changer.

00:37.460 --> 00:39.080
Glad you decided
to do the right thing

00:39.080 --> 00:40.960
and come clean
to Agent Johnson.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.460
So what exactly
are you gonna say?

00:42.460 --> 00:44.170
I'm just gonna
be honest.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.880
Say that I failed
my mission,

00:45.880 --> 00:48.380
it was my fault that the Storm
Maker plans got stolen,

00:48.380 --> 00:50.380
and I will do whatever I
have to do to make it right.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.710
That's my girl.
Honesty is the best policy.

00:53.830 --> 00:55.580
Get out, Brustrom.

00:55.580 --> 00:57.670
I don't care
if you were honest with me.

00:57.670 --> 01:00.500
You failed your mission,
and you can't be trusted.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.500
Plus, I know it was you

01:02.500 --> 01:04.380
who took the last
powdered doughnut.

01:08.380 --> 01:09.960
On second thought,
I'm gonna lie.

01:09.960 --> 01:11.330
I'm gonna lie
straight through my teeth.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.540

We have to find a way
to make this right.

02:12.540 --> 02:16.250
Pin it on Agent Brustrom?

02:16.250 --> 02:18.290
He's already fired.
He's not going to know.

02:18.290 --> 02:20.420
No.

02:20.420 --> 02:23.210
We need to find a way
to stop the Other Side

02:23.210 --> 02:25.080
from using the plans
they stole.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.420
Ooh, I got it.
I got it.

02:28.420 --> 02:30.120
So Storm Maker runs on
a very rare energy source

02:30.120 --> 02:32.120
- called dilithium.
- Dilithium?

02:32.120 --> 02:34.670
How come nothing runs on
triple-A batteries anymore?

02:34.670 --> 02:36.880
Yes, Dad, 'cause
a catastrophic

02:36.880 --> 02:38.830
doomsday machine
is gonna run on

02:38.830 --> 02:41.420
the same batteries
as your nose hair clippers.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.670
By the way, you might wanna pick
up some of those triple A's.

02:45.620 --> 02:49.080
Where the heck is the Other Side
gonna find dilithium?

02:49.080 --> 02:50.620
Better question is,

02:50.620 --> 02:53.250
how are we gonna
find it before they do?

02:55.580 --> 02:59.580
Okay, Dad, I'm gonna need you
to back up a little bit,

02:59.580 --> 03:01.580
'cause I feel like
your nose hairs

03:01.580 --> 03:03.710
are tickling
the back of my neck.

03:06.710 --> 03:09.330
( doorbell rings )

03:09.330 --> 03:11.830
( doorbell rings )

03:12.960 --> 03:14.500
Someone's at
the door.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
Well, get it.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.330
I'm not getting it,
you get it.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.460
( doorbell rings )

03:20.460 --> 03:22.460
All right,
rock, paper, scissors.

03:23.670 --> 03:24.880
BOTH: Tie.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.540
( doorbell rings )

03:26.540 --> 03:28.330
One more time.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.710
BOTH: Tie.

03:31.710 --> 03:34.380
PETEY:
Judy!! Judy!!

03:34.380 --> 03:36.380
Get the door.

03:42.670 --> 03:45.210
What is it, Petey?

03:45.210 --> 03:47.290
Did you bring
my homework home for me?

03:47.290 --> 03:49.920
Yeah, but how come you didn't
come to school today?

03:49.920 --> 03:51.540
You don't look sick.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.960
It was a personal day.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.460
Great-grandma Glenda died.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.750
She was 98.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.290
Oh.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.920
Oh?

04:04.920 --> 04:07.460
As in "Oh, sorry for
your loss"?

04:07.460 --> 04:10.460
No, oh as in,
"Oh, why did I open the door?"

04:11.920 --> 04:14.500
Judy, I cannot
believe you.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.210
Would it kill you
to be kinder to Petey?

04:17.210 --> 04:21.580
No. Does it cost anything
to show a little sympathy? No.

04:21.580 --> 04:23.620
Is it conversations
like this

04:23.620 --> 04:25.750
that make me want to trade places
with Great-grandma Glenda?

04:25.750 --> 04:27.500
Yes.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.750
So did the Organization freak
out 'cause you lost the plans

04:34.750 --> 04:36.170
for that Storm Maker
machine?

04:36.170 --> 04:38.420
Not at all,
because I lied to 'em.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.250
Like I was gonna
tell 'em

04:41.250 --> 04:43.670
I brought the plans to a school
dance and they got stolen.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.620
What? KC Cooper
told a lie.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.170
What is next, you're gonna
copy my English paper?

04:49.170 --> 04:51.580
Why would I do that?
I would just be copying a copy

04:51.580 --> 04:54.170
of my paper.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.790
You know what, sometimes,
you gotta lie.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.420
Right, like in first grade,
when Mrs. Andrews said

04:58.420 --> 05:01.540
I would eventually
need math in real life?

05:03.670 --> 05:05.960
Marisa, you need math now.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.670
The lunch ladies are tired
of you coming up with

05:07.670 --> 05:10.290
a big bag of coins, asking
how much will this get me?

05:10.290 --> 05:12.750
Laugh all you want to,
but I had two meatballs

05:12.750 --> 05:15.250
and half an apple
for lunch yesterday.

05:15.250 --> 05:18.000
For $23.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.210
Wrong. 92 quarters.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.540
That's $23.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.500
A little lie
isn't even gonna matter,

05:27.500 --> 05:29.040
because I'm gonna find
a way to make this right

05:29.040 --> 05:30.670
- with this Storm Maker machine.
- How?

05:30.670 --> 05:32.420
My dad and I found out

05:32.420 --> 05:34.080
that the only supply
of dilithium

05:34.080 --> 05:35.670
will be passing through a truck
stop in Knoxville tomorrow.

05:35.670 --> 05:38.670
Wouldn't it be easier to just
order the dilithium online?

05:38.670 --> 05:40.710
Marisa, dilithium
is a power source

05:40.710 --> 05:43.080
for the Storm Maker;
it's incredibly rare.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.460
So is 50% off my mascara,

05:45.460 --> 05:48.670
but if you look hard enough,
you'll find it.

05:48.670 --> 05:50.080
All right, anyway,
I gotta go.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.460
Where's the check?

05:51.460 --> 05:53.380
Don't worry.
I got it.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.080
Look at you paying.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.210
It's like I don't even
know you anymore.

06:00.210 --> 06:04.670
Of course. You know,
like, everything about me.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.290
Hey, Brady,
it's Marisa.

06:09.290 --> 06:10.920
I just found out something
about KC

06:10.920 --> 06:13.670
that you're definitely
gonna wanna hear.

06:13.670 --> 06:15.670
But first, does this
sound like enough

06:15.670 --> 06:17.710
for a medium pizza?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.710
Got a second,
Agent Johnson?

06:23.710 --> 06:27.120
Sure, Ernie. Just let me
finish this work email.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.920
The new laser-proof wetsuit

06:28.920 --> 06:32.500
provides neither
the support I need,

06:32.500 --> 06:35.040
nor the comfort
I demand.

06:36.670 --> 06:39.330
Mission not accomplished.

06:39.330 --> 06:41.460
So what do you need?

06:41.460 --> 06:43.750
Okay, well,
I'm not naming names,

06:43.750 --> 06:46.250
but I'm concerned about
one of our agents.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.920
- Which one?
- I'd rather not say.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.500
But what do you do

06:50.500 --> 06:52.080
when you're assigned
to work with someone

06:52.080 --> 06:55.540
who's a loud, obnoxious,
rude, cold-hearted windbag?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.170
Judy.

06:57.170 --> 06:59.080
You named her, not me.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.920
But just to be clear,
Judy is the agent

07:01.920 --> 07:04.500
I'm not naming.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.120
Although Lord knows,

07:06.120 --> 07:09.790
she's got
a lot of names for me.

07:09.790 --> 07:11.380
So what's Judy done now?

07:11.380 --> 07:13.210
She's not protecting
her cover.

07:13.210 --> 07:15.330
Earlier today,
she wouldn't even pretend

07:15.330 --> 07:17.290
to care that her best friend
suffered a loss.

07:17.290 --> 07:20.790
Ernie, I know Judy's
incredibly life-like,

07:20.790 --> 07:23.540
but don't forget,
she is still a robot.

07:23.540 --> 07:27.670
Her emotional processor
probably just needs an upgrade.

07:27.670 --> 07:30.040
Here, this should dial up

07:30.040 --> 07:32.420
her appropriate
emotional responses.

07:32.420 --> 07:33.960
Thanks, Agent Johnson.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.580
Hey, Ernie,
before you leave,

07:35.580 --> 07:37.580
could you help me
with something?

07:37.580 --> 07:38.750
Just name it.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.290
I'm having a little trouble
getting out of these.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.750
Do me a favor, have Carl
bring up a pair of scissors

07:47.750 --> 07:49.750
and a bottle of corn oil.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.330
Sorry, I just got
an assignment

07:51.330 --> 07:53.080
to perform an upgrade.
You're on your own.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.330
Why do I need
more emotions?

08:01.330 --> 08:03.670
I already have
disappointment in humanity.

08:03.670 --> 08:06.580
That's all the emotion
I need.

08:06.580 --> 08:09.000
The Organization
ordered this, Judy.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.670
You'll just
have to deal with it.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.580
PETEY: Judy!!

08:17.580 --> 08:20.460
- ( doorbell rings )
- Judy!!

08:20.460 --> 08:22.830
Let Petey in,

08:22.830 --> 08:24.290
and be nice this time.

08:30.170 --> 08:31.920
Hey, Judy.

08:31.920 --> 08:33.290
My mom says
I have to stay here

08:33.290 --> 08:36.210
while she reevaluates
her life choices.

08:36.210 --> 08:38.460
So what I'm hearing is,
you'll be here a while.

08:40.210 --> 08:42.960
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna bother you.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.710
I'll just sit here quietly,

08:44.710 --> 08:46.790
and try not to be upset
about Great-grandma Glenda.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.670
Are you on that again?
Petey, I...

08:53.380 --> 08:56.040
I want to apologize
for how I behaved.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.000
You were feeling sad,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.710
and I disregarded
your emotions.

09:00.710 --> 09:02.210
That is my bad.

09:04.330 --> 09:06.500
Uh...

09:06.500 --> 09:07.880
what?

09:09.500 --> 09:12.620
I'm saying
I'm sorry.

09:12.620 --> 09:16.620
Okay, I'm not gonna lie,
I'm a little scared right now.

09:16.620 --> 09:18.620
Don't be.

09:18.620 --> 09:21.080
We're friends,
and friends are the angels

09:21.080 --> 09:22.880
who lift us
up to our feet

09:22.880 --> 09:27.170
when our wings have trouble
remembering how to fly.

09:27.170 --> 09:29.080
Mom, Judy's
freaking me out!

09:29.080 --> 09:32.540
She's being nice!
Mom!!

09:34.080 --> 09:38.380
Hm. Wonder when that emotional
upgrade's gonna kick in.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.960
Cookie, what's goin' on
back there?

09:54.960 --> 09:59.040
Did you have drive to
Philly for the cheesesteak?

09:59.040 --> 10:02.750
Calm down.
I'm workin' on it.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.330
Workin' or hardly workin'?

10:04.330 --> 10:06.670
Look at all these hungry
people waitin' for their food.

10:06.670 --> 10:08.250
Come on, move it.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.460
No sign of the truck
delivering the dilithium yet,

10:10.460 --> 10:12.460
but I'll let you know
if I see it.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.670
Miss, can I please
get a menu?

10:16.670 --> 10:17.920
Oh, yeah, sure.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.040
Here ya go.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.880
Uh, I don't think
he was done with this one.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.710
He snoozes,
I chooses.

10:24.710 --> 10:26.000
Then what do
you recommend?

10:27.710 --> 10:29.290
Eating at
a better restaurant.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.750
Yeah, I just found out

10:40.750 --> 10:42.750
that KC is at a truck stop
in Knoxville.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.750
I'm flying there now to
intercept the dilithium

10:44.750 --> 10:46.880
before she can get it.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.880
The Alternate will not fail.

10:52.420 --> 10:53.920
Uh, Ernie.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.620
Buddy.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.210
Hey, how long have
you been standing there?

10:57.210 --> 10:59.460
Long enough to know
you're an enemy spy.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.040
I heard everything
you said.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.540
Oh, that's too bad.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.750
I didn't want
to have to hurt you.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.040
Hurt me?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.960
You know,
on second thought,

11:08.960 --> 11:11.420
I doubt I heard
everything you said.

11:11.420 --> 11:16.000
Actually, I think I didn't
hear anything you said.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.620
In fact, I already forgot
what we were talking about.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.040
( both laughing )

11:22.120 --> 11:24.580
That's right, you forgot.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
All right, you ordered
a cup of belch water,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.170
a short stack with skid grease,
and a side of whistle berries.

11:38.170 --> 11:39.620
And for you, the "chicken."

11:39.620 --> 11:43.080
I'm putting quotes around it
because I legally have to.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.170
It's not really chicken. At least,
not the parts you're used to.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Welcome to Mama's
Gas N Go,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.120
or as we call it,
Mama's Gas.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.380
You'll understand later
when you have to go.

11:56.880 --> 12:00.040
Okay, order in.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.880
Give me a cowboy
with spur and a slab of moo,

12:02.880 --> 12:05.170
let him chew it, and two cows,
make 'em cry.

12:05.170 --> 12:07.170
What the heck
does that mean?

12:07.170 --> 12:08.670
That means I want
a western omelet with fries,

12:08.670 --> 12:10.710
rare steak and two
hamburgers with onions.

12:10.710 --> 12:12.000
Why didn't you
just say so?

12:12.000 --> 12:13.460
I put on a wig,
I'm in character.

12:13.460 --> 12:15.210
You gotta deal with it.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.210
You deal with this--
everyone in here

12:17.210 --> 12:18.830
is getting cold sandwiches,
'cause that's the only thing

12:18.830 --> 12:21.080
I know how to make.
Hey, Tillie.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.290
- Gladys.
- Gladys, whatever your name is.

12:23.290 --> 12:25.080
Look, did you find
the truck we're looking for?

12:25.080 --> 12:26.830
No. When I do,
I'll let you know.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.250
Okay, good. We need to
finish this mission soon.

12:29.250 --> 12:32.170
I'm starting to sweat like
a sweaty guy in a sweater.

12:32.170 --> 12:35.040
That explains all the "food
is too salty" complaints.

12:40.670 --> 12:42.170
Something wrong
with your memory?

12:42.170 --> 12:44.580
You already gave me
the emotional upgrade.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.210
No, I didn't,

12:46.210 --> 12:48.330
and there's nothing
wrong with my memory.

12:48.330 --> 12:50.420
Steel trap.
Nothing gets out.

12:50.420 --> 12:51.710
Or in.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.040
Upgrade complete.

13:01.620 --> 13:02.670
( doorbell rings )

13:02.670 --> 13:05.290
Judy!!

13:05.290 --> 13:07.290
Judy!!

13:07.290 --> 13:09.250
Petey!

13:12.120 --> 13:14.120
I'm so happy to see you!

13:15.960 --> 13:17.330
Okay.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.080
Anyway, I brought
a board game.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.420
It's Bunnies!!!
with three exclamation points,

13:23.420 --> 13:26.120
so you know it's fun.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.210
Well, if it'll
make you happy,

13:28.210 --> 13:30.460
then let's
make you happy.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.580
Judy, why are you still
being so nice to me?

13:34.580 --> 13:36.710
I guess I feel bad
about not feeling bad

13:36.710 --> 13:38.250
about Great-grandma Glenda.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.170
Well, she was
a great goldfish.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.710
Uh, what now?

13:44.210 --> 13:45.500
A goldfish.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.250
Great-grandma Glenda
was a goldfish?

13:48.250 --> 13:50.290
You said she lived
to be 98.

13:50.290 --> 13:53.120
Days. She lived
for 98 days.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.540
( crying )

13:58.540 --> 14:01.330
Are you sad about Great-grandma
Glenda's passing, too?

14:01.330 --> 14:05.170
No, I'm sad because I was
nice to you for no reason.

14:05.170 --> 14:07.920
( resumes crying )

14:12.250 --> 14:14.000
Miss.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.290
Miss!

14:15.290 --> 14:17.040
Do you mind?

14:17.040 --> 14:20.210
I'm tryin' to eat
my lunch.

14:20.210 --> 14:23.000
Yes, I do mind.
I'm trying to get my check.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.330
You want a check,
sweetie?

14:24.330 --> 14:27.330
Check your attitude.

14:27.330 --> 14:30.170
As I said before,
Gladys is on her lunch break.

14:31.580 --> 14:35.330
I'd like to be
on a lunch break.

14:35.330 --> 14:38.420
But you haven't
brought my lunch.

14:38.420 --> 14:42.580
I'll get to you
when I get to you.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.380
But my blood sugar's
feeling a little low.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.920
Oh, really?

14:48.580 --> 14:51.120
That oughta hold ya.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.330
- Tillie.
- Gladys.

14:54.330 --> 14:55.750
Gladys Tillie,
get over here.

14:57.540 --> 15:01.250
The truck just parked.
License plate LMP 247.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.540
The driver's heading
towards the diner.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.210
Okay, keep him busy.
I'll grab the dilithium.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.460
Okay.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.580
Miss! I'm still
waiting on my check.

15:09.580 --> 15:13.290
Um... it's on the house.
For everybody.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.880
By the way, don't forget
to tip your waitress, okay?

15:17.880 --> 15:21.170
Gladys may give away free food,
but she don't work for free.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.750
- Hey, where's KC?
- I don't know.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.210
So she's not back
from her mission?

15:30.210 --> 15:32.170
I don't know about
any mission.

15:32.170 --> 15:34.960
So she didn't get that
dilithium thingy?

15:34.960 --> 15:37.170
What dilithium thingy?

15:37.170 --> 15:40.580
Why do you know more about
KC's missions than I do?

15:40.580 --> 15:43.000
And why are you so interested?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.040
It's like you're spying
on her or something.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.620
Okay, spying on KC?!

15:50.620 --> 15:53.330
I don't care what
anyone says, Ernie,

15:53.330 --> 15:56.170
you...you, sir,
are hilarious.

16:04.250 --> 16:07.080
- So, I'll let her know you stopped by?
- That'd be good.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.170
Brady, it's Marisa.

16:17.170 --> 16:20.500
I didn't find out anything new
about KC's Storm Maker mission.

16:20.500 --> 16:23.580
As usual,
Ernie doesn't know a thing.

16:27.460 --> 16:30.170
Marisa's a spy!
And so is Brady!

16:32.250 --> 16:34.040
Agent Johnson,
it's Ernie Cooper.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.460
Code Red emergency.

16:35.460 --> 16:38.290
The entire Organization
may be compromised.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.040
I better tell you
the details in person

16:40.040 --> 16:41.830
in case this channel
isn't secure.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.920
Get over here
as soon as you can!

16:45.460 --> 16:48.250
Marisa! What are you doing
sneaking around?

16:57.460 --> 17:00.000
I'm getting good at this.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.040
Dad, there's nothing
in this truck

17:07.040 --> 17:08.580
except crates
full of stuffed bears.

17:08.580 --> 17:10.580
The dilithium must be
inside one of them.

17:10.580 --> 17:12.540
You gotta find it, and quick.

17:12.540 --> 17:15.250
I don't know how long
I can stall the driver.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.920
BEAR: Wuv you.
Wuv you.

17:19.920 --> 17:21.330
Wuv you.

17:21.330 --> 17:23.830
I would "wuv" if you had
the dilithium in you.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.790
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

17:28.790 --> 17:30.420
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.790
You ordered Swiss,
and I gave you American.

17:31.790 --> 17:33.500
Or was it pepper jack?

17:33.500 --> 17:36.170
Any cheese is fine.
Give me back my burger.

17:36.170 --> 17:37.920
No, no, you're
a hard-workin' brother,

17:37.920 --> 17:40.290
and you ordered
a cheeseburger,

17:40.290 --> 17:41.960
and I'm gonna give it to you
exactly the way you like it,

17:41.960 --> 17:43.500
even if it takes all day.
Bleu cheese, right?

17:43.500 --> 17:44.540
- Swiss.
- Cheddar.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.540
- Swiss.
- Brie. Got it.

17:46.540 --> 17:48.580
Swiss!

17:48.580 --> 17:50.000
Wuv you.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.120
I got it.
We're good to go.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.790
I'll just meet you
in the diner...

18:05.040 --> 18:06.830
KC, are you okay?

18:06.830 --> 18:08.960
KC?

18:08.960 --> 18:10.580
Yeah, I'm fine,

18:10.580 --> 18:11.880
but the truck's
getting away.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.210
Don't worry, baby,
we'll get him at the next stop.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.420
No, I'm gonna fix this.

18:45.420 --> 18:48.080
Why can't I just
go to a mall

18:48.080 --> 18:51.170
on a Thursday afternoon
like every other teenager?

19:03.880 --> 19:07.460
Hey! Know where
I can get some teddy bears?

19:07.460 --> 19:10.500
Or maybe some dilithium?

19:28.920 --> 19:31.040
( groaning )

19:35.880 --> 19:38.040
Agent Johnson?
What are you doing here?

19:38.040 --> 19:40.210
What do you mean?
You called me with a Code Red.

19:40.210 --> 19:42.330
Uhhh... no, I didn't.

19:42.330 --> 19:43.790
I think I'd remember
if I'd done that.

19:43.790 --> 19:45.880
It's Agent Johnson!

19:45.880 --> 19:49.500
Yay!!!

19:49.500 --> 19:52.290
Thank you sooooo much
for having me built!

19:52.290 --> 19:56.040
What the heck
did you do to Judy?

19:56.040 --> 19:58.710
Nothing. Just gave her
the upgrade like you told me to.

19:58.710 --> 20:00.920
I told you to give her
one emotional upgrade,

20:00.920 --> 20:03.920
not turn her into
a greeting card commercial.

20:03.920 --> 20:05.830
Okay, there you go.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.750
Okay, that should reset her
back to normal.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.250
Ew. Why was I hugging you?

20:15.250 --> 20:17.670
I never get
this close to people.

20:17.670 --> 20:19.620
Unless it's to flip
them on the ground.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.670
Oh, please don't,
I had trouble

20:21.670 --> 20:24.500
getting out of a wetsuit,
and I threw out my...

20:26.500 --> 20:28.500
...back.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.380
You want me to call Carl?

20:33.380 --> 20:34.580
Call Carl.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.040
KC, KC.
You okay? KC.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.120
Yeah, I'll be all right
if you stop slapping me.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.250
I'm fine though.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.330
I'm just a little bruised
especially my ego.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.620
It's okay, honey. I know
you gave it your best.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.750
It's just so frustrating.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.830
I feel like every single mission
I've been going on lately,

20:53.830 --> 20:55.540
it goes bad.

20:55.540 --> 20:57.830
It's like somebody's
just one step ahead of me.

20:57.830 --> 20:59.620
Maybe I'm just
being paranoid.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.290
Who would be
out to get me?

21:05.880 --> 21:07.710
Hey, sorry
I'm late, guys.

21:07.710 --> 21:09.540
It's all good.
We were just, um...

21:09.540 --> 21:12.250
Okay, uh, what happened
to your face?

21:12.250 --> 21:16.250
Uh, God blessed me
with great looks.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.620
No, I don't think he did.

21:18.620 --> 21:20.790
I'm talking about
the scratches.

21:20.790 --> 21:22.880
Oh, nothing.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.710
I was playing with
my cat and it scratched me.

21:24.710 --> 21:27.120
You have a cat?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.120
Yeah.
You remember.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.750
Mr. Whiskers.

21:30.750 --> 21:34.290
Oh! Oh, Mr. Whiskers.

21:34.290 --> 21:36.710
You totally
have a cat.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.330
He totally has a cat
with a lot of whiskers,

21:38.330 --> 21:40.500
which is why he
named him Mr. Whiskers.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.420
Well, cats will scratch.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.580
You know what?
Save your change babe.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.380
I'll pay for this one.

22:01.210 --> 22:02.960
Oh, he'll pay, all right.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.670
He'll definitely pay.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.790
Rob, your name's on TV.
