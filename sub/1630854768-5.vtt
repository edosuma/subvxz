ASHA:
Captain Strand, it's been said

05:48.090 --> 05:52.851
you foster a certain culture
here at the 126.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.910
I'd like to think so.

05:53.912 --> 05:55.687

05:57.933 --> 06:00.058

-ASHA: I have.

06:05.515 --> 06:08.592
But we both know
the 126 has a reputation

06:08.594 --> 06:09.926

06:09.928 --> 06:10.869

06:10.871 --> 06:14.355

-Yeah.

Unfortunately, I can't
disclose that information.

06:28.797 --> 06:32.206
Oh, well, I can disclose that
he's a disgruntled prima donna

06:32.208 --> 06:34.559
whose, uh,
departure was mutual.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.786
-Both times he worked here?
-TOMMY VEGA: That's right.

06:36.788 --> 06:37.896
Mm-hmm. Both times.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.732
Were any words said
when he left?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.792
-On either occasion.
-Uh...

06:42.794 --> 06:45.070
I may have called him a coward.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.906
We called him that because
he was a coward, and a jerk.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.633
And you can,
you can write that down

06:49.635 --> 06:51.076
in your little book
if you want to.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.636
Now, would you say name-calling

06:52.638 --> 06:55.080
is common practice
in this firehouse?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.657
You must be
talking about Lard Ass.

06:57.659 --> 06:58.825
Lard Ass?

06:58.827 --> 07:00.234
There was no body shaming.

07:00.236 --> 07:02.587
The man's torso was stuck
in a drive-through window.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.905
Cap got the brilliant idea

07:03.907 --> 07:05.832
to slather
the man's hindquarters

07:05.834 --> 07:07.817
in rendered pig fat.

07:07.819 --> 07:09.386
-Ergo...
-Lard Ass.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.434
Do you happen to know
this man's actual name?

07:15.436 --> 07:17.827
I would love to get
a statement from him, too.

07:17.829 --> 07:19.996
No, but I'm sure
you can get it

07:19.998 --> 07:21.831

Texas State Prison system.

07:21.833 --> 07:23.424

Bam, bam.

07:31.843 --> 07:33.034
I don't think so.

07:36.181 --> 07:37.956
And you're sure
there's been no other time

07:37.958 --> 07:39.774
you've ever heard
an insult or a slur

07:39.776 --> 07:41.184

in the field?

07:41.277 --> 07:44.521
I will remind you,
you may be called
to testify to this.

07:44.523 --> 07:45.780
There may be one other one.

07:45.782 --> 07:48.391
It's gonna sound a lot worse
without the context.

07:48.393 --> 07:51.027
-Try me.
-He called the dude
a woman-beater-cuck.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.471
-Cuck?
-NANCY GILLIAN:

07:57.035 --> 08:00.870
Owen only said that to goad
the man into striking him

08:00.872 --> 08:03.482
so that the cops would have
an excuse to arrest him.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.483
Goaded. I see.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.133
The guy was
a total abuser, okay?

08:06.135 --> 08:07.727
He was gonna
hurt his wife and kids

08:07.729 --> 08:08.728
<i> and my dad stopped him.</i>

08:08.730 --> 08:10.137

it hadn't come to that.

08:10.139 --> 08:12.324
He would never do something
stupid like that again.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.234
Did he do something
stupid like that again?

08:14.236 --> 08:16.811
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me?

08:16.813 --> 08:18.646
Yes, there is, actually.

to pursue a healthy
workplace environment.

09:06.271 --> 09:08.195
You really have no idea
what this is about?

09:08.197 --> 09:09.363
No. Hand to God.

09:09.457 --> 09:12.458
Do you recall the events
of Monday, January 9th,

09:12.460 --> 09:13.793
the rescue of the mobile home?

09:13.962 --> 09:17.538
Yes. I recall being lowered
from a chopper onto a house

09:17.540 --> 09:21.301
<i> that was being driven</i>
<i> by a deranged man</i>
<i> down Highway 9</i>

09:21.303 --> 09:24.378
with his ex-wife
trapped screaming inside.

09:24.380 --> 09:27.807
According to the IR,
you were the lead

09:27.809 --> 09:30.718
on extracting the wife
from the home.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.812
-Is that correct?
-Oh.

09:32.814 --> 09:34.221
(Lila yells)

09:34.223 --> 09:35.465
Is this about the skylight?

09:35.558 --> 09:37.558
This is about what happened
after the skylight.

09:37.560 --> 09:38.985
I'm here to rescue you!

09:38.987 --> 09:41.562
I am not leaving this house!

09:41.564 --> 09:43.064
I am standing my ground!

09:43.066 --> 09:44.231
-(rumbling)
-(gasps)

09:44.233 --> 09:45.900
Specifically when you attempted

09:45.902 --> 09:47.994
to harness Lila Geralds.

09:47.996 --> 09:50.997
My rope work was sound.
I did all my checks.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.816
She was properly clipped
and clamped.

09:52.818 --> 09:53.925
This is not about
your rope work.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.743
Do you remember
what you said on the radio

09:55.745 --> 09:57.912
before you made egress
from the residence?

09:57.914 --> 09:59.656
Uh, not word for word.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.324
OWEN (over radio):
<i> Hey, Marjan,</i>
<i> what's the holdup?</i>

10:01.326 --> 10:04.494
Slight holdup being
that she's a crazy lady, Cap!

10:04.496 --> 10:06.496
-Does that sound accurate?
-Could have been.

10:06.498 --> 10:09.182
Can you tell me
why you felt the need
to use language like that?

10:09.184 --> 10:11.258
I had to compel her
to move her butt.

10:11.260 --> 10:13.094
She says you
made her feel unsafe.

10:13.096 --> 10:16.005
(scoffs)
I made her feel unsafe?

10:16.007 --> 10:19.192
We-we were hanging from
a helicopter with her husband

10:19.194 --> 10:22.512
doing 50 on the highway,
and I made her feel unsafe?

10:22.514 --> 10:25.865
Are you aware that "crazy"
is considered a slur?

10:25.867 --> 10:28.442
-Yes.
-ASHA: You know from
your department manual

10:28.444 --> 10:31.278
that we value the emotional
well-being of the public

10:31.280 --> 10:33.356
as much as their
physical well-being.

10:33.358 --> 10:35.449
And we consider it
the duty of a firefighter

10:35.451 --> 10:39.362
to protect both at all times
to the best of their abilities.

10:39.364 --> 10:42.031
Jeopardizing either
is a serious offense.

10:42.033 --> 10:45.268
So, how much trouble
am I looking at here?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.817
Uh, it's me, Linus.
Are you okay?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.527
LINUS (over phone):
<i> Please, you have to help me.</i>

10:55.714 --> 10:56.880
<i> I'm in so much trouble.</i>

10:56.882 --> 10:58.139
<i> It's all burned.</i>

10:58.141 --> 11:00.182
-What's all burned?
-LINUS:<i> Mac and cheese.</i>

11:00.184 --> 11:02.218
I thought I did everything
just like my mom.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.978
<i> But then the oven</i>
<i> started smoking.</i>

11:03.980 --> 11:05.238
Okay. Is anything on fire?

11:05.240 --> 11:07.666
No, just smoke.
But it's all gone now.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.317
<i> -I turned it off.</i>
-Okay. Well, that's good.

11:10.319 --> 11:13.062
But you shouldn't be
using the oven on your own.

11:13.064 --> 11:14.005
<i> Did you burn yourself?</i>

11:14.007 --> 11:15.581
No, just the casserole dish.

11:15.583 --> 11:17.066
<i> You have to help me</i>
<i> clean this dish.</i>

11:17.068 --> 11:18.343
<i> It was my great-grandma's.</i>

11:18.345 --> 11:20.828
<i> My mom's gonna kill me</i>
<i> if she wakes up and sees this.</i>

11:20.830 --> 11:23.014
Linus, don't you
have school today?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.790
Mom has a headache
so she said I could

11:24.792 --> 11:26.092
stay home
and watch<i> Star Wars.</i>

11:26.094 --> 11:27.686
<i> -She's taking a nap.</i>
-Mm-hmm.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.096
And does your mom take
a lot of naps during the day?

11:30.098 --> 11:30.930
Lately, I guess.

11:30.932 --> 11:32.098
<i> When she gets her headaches.</i>

11:32.100 --> 11:34.025
LINUS' MOM:
<i> Linus, are you on the phone?</i>

11:34.027 --> 11:35.768
Who are you talking to?

11:35.770 --> 11:37.754
Uh, 9-1-1.

11:37.756 --> 11:39.197
LINUS' MOM:
<i> Why are you calling 9-1-1?</i>

11:39.199 --> 11:41.015
<i> LINUS:</i>
<i> I burned your dish.</i>
<i> I didn't know how to clean it.</i>

11:41.017 --> 11:43.017
LINUS' MOM:
<i> That is not something</i>
<i> you call 9-1-1 for.</i>

11:43.019 --> 11:46.279
(slurring speech)
<i> You only call 9-1-1</i>
<i> in emergen-shees.</i>

11:46.281 --> 11:47.931
<i> Darn it, Linus,</i>
<i> they can arrest you for that.</i>

11:47.933 --> 11:49.541
<i> Give me the phone.</i>
<i> Hello?</i>

11:49.543 --> 11:50.767
Mrs. McKinley.

11:50.769 --> 11:51.951
<i> Hi. This is, uh, Grace Ryder</i>

11:51.953 --> 11:53.694
<i> from Austin</i>
<i> Emergency Services.</i>

11:53.696 --> 11:57.048
Don't worry.
I can assure you nobody
is getting arrested today.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.792
I'm so sorry.
My "fun" knows better.

11:59.794 --> 12:01.553
<i> He won't trouble you anymore.</i>

12:01.555 --> 12:04.371
No, that's okay.
He's no trouble at all.

12:04.373 --> 12:06.141
You have a good one, okay?

12:10.638 --> 12:12.147
(quiet sigh)

12:13.925 --> 12:16.067
She was asking me
so many questions
I couldn't keep up.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.236
I mean, I don't know
if I said the right answer.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.221
I mean, God, I hope
I didn't say the wrong one.

12:20.223 --> 12:21.906
You told the truth,
and that's all you can do.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.725
I just hope I didn't
get Cap in more trouble
than he's already in.

12:24.727 --> 12:27.987
-MARJAN MARWANI:
Cap's not in trouble.
-JUDD RYDER: He ain't?

12:27.989 --> 12:30.673
Uh, yeah, no, um, nothing.

12:30.675 --> 12:31.641
He's-he's clear.

12:31.643 --> 12:32.751
-Oh!
-Told you.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.127
Thank God.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.571
Well, then, who got in trouble?

12:37.573 --> 12:39.148
-PAUL STRICKLAND: Oh, no.
-JUDD: Aw, man.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.592
-Wait, you?
-Marjan!

12:40.594 --> 12:42.001
-Marj.
-Remember that lady

12:42.003 --> 12:44.411
that we had to pull out
of the runaway house?

12:44.413 --> 12:45.505
Yeah, of course.

12:45.507 --> 12:46.264
You remember the moment

12:46.266 --> 12:47.673
where I called her crazy?

12:47.675 --> 12:48.841
Yeah, on the radio.

12:48.843 --> 12:50.660
I guess that triggered her.

12:50.662 --> 12:52.512
What? That's crazy!

12:52.514 --> 12:54.664
I mean, ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.

12:54.666 --> 12:57.333
So what are we, uh, what are
we lookin' at punishment-wise?

12:57.335 --> 13:00.503
She said they like to keep
their options elastic

13:00.505 --> 13:03.523
until the IR board
has reviewed all the facts.

13:03.525 --> 13:08.678
So, um, could be a slap
on the wrist or could be worse.

13:08.680 --> 13:09.846
I mean, look, in hindsight,

13:09.864 --> 13:11.956
I had no clinical evidence
to call her that.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.699
So, yeah, maybe that was wrong.

13:13.701 --> 13:14.942
Marj... (sighs)

13:14.961 --> 13:17.020
I guess it only makes
sense that this could ruin

13:17.022 --> 13:19.780
everything I've ever
worked for in my career.

13:19.782 --> 13:21.524
Like, if I wanted to be
more technically accurate,

13:21.526 --> 13:23.501
I probably should have
called her a blubbering fool

13:23.503 --> 13:25.637
or a suicidal moron
or an inbred.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.471
-I just--
-Marwani.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.697
Put a clamp on it.

13:27.699 --> 13:29.991
Rest of you,
you're officially back on shift.

13:29.993 --> 13:31.684
So get your heads right.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.061
A word, please?

13:36.891 --> 13:39.133
Look, I think you need
to be very careful

13:39.135 --> 13:40.893
about what you're
saying right now.

13:40.895 --> 13:43.137
I just don't want you
to dig yourself any deeper.

13:43.139 --> 13:44.897
What, I'm not allowed to vent?

13:44.899 --> 13:46.232
I just got a HR sucker punch.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.975
It's not like the crew
are gonna turn me in.

13:47.977 --> 13:49.068
No, no, I'm not
worried about them.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.811
I'm just saying,
I think you need to assume

13:50.813 --> 13:52.196
that there are ears everywhere.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.833
Look, I've been in
your exact same place.

13:54.835 --> 13:55.983
I know what you're
going through.

13:55.985 --> 13:57.743
I've been in
the crosshairs of HR

13:57.745 --> 13:58.895
over something stupid.

13:58.897 --> 14:00.079
Okay, well, that wasn't
my exact position

14:00.081 --> 14:01.581
because I called the lady
a mean name,

14:01.583 --> 14:03.824
and you knocked out
the deputy fire chief.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.159
Hm, let's not split hairs.

14:05.161 --> 14:06.827
He wasn't the deputy fire chief
when I hit him.

14:06.829 --> 14:08.621
He was
the deputy fire chief elect.

14:08.623 --> 14:09.496
Ah, right.

14:09.498 --> 14:11.074
And I am the one
splitting hairs.

14:11.076 --> 14:13.593
It's hard to have
the sword of Damocles
over your head,

14:13.595 --> 14:15.169
but the good news is

14:15.171 --> 14:17.856
that they wanna see us
at headquarters today.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.765
Today? H-how is
that good news?

14:19.767 --> 14:21.860
Because it means they're not
gonna draw this process out.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.419
-(sighs deeply)
-This is usually the last step.

14:23.421 --> 14:26.923
Oh, my God, I just wanna
crawl into a hole and hide.

14:26.925 --> 14:28.591
Why do you think
I ran for the hills?

14:28.593 --> 14:31.352
I'm just sayin'.
I got your back on this.

14:31.354 --> 14:32.519
(bell ringing)

14:32.764 --> 14:35.264
MAN (over radio):
<i> Public assist. Public assist.</i>

14:35.266 --> 14:36.857
I need you to stand down
on this one.

14:36.859 --> 14:38.543
You're benching me?

14:38.545 --> 14:39.627
You're... Uh...

14:40.696 --> 14:41.880
How is that having my back?

14:41.882 --> 14:43.272
I don't want anybody
in the field

14:43.274 --> 14:45.566
whose head's in the rinse cycle.

14:45.568 --> 14:47.051
Not good for anyone.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.870
Have a chai. Relax.

14:49.872 --> 14:51.598
Dress uniform.
Five o'clock.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.522
(siren wailing)

15:00.400 --> 15:02.483
(horn blares)

15:19.994 --> 15:21.644
MARJAN:
Can I help you?

15:21.646 --> 15:22.979
Oh, hi.

15:22.981 --> 15:25.498
Uh, is Captain Strand around?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.999
No, he's not.

15:27.001 --> 15:29.427
This is his firehouse,
though, right?

15:29.429 --> 15:32.138
Yeah, but he's out with
his team on a call right now.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.265
They left you behind?

15:35.660 --> 15:38.010
Is there something
I can help you with?

15:38.012 --> 15:39.562
You're Firefox, right?

15:41.499 --> 15:42.848
MARJAN: Uh, yeah.

15:42.850 --> 15:44.758
MAN:
Oh. I'm-I'm a big fan.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.352
I started following you
on Instagram

15:46.354 --> 15:49.021
after the attack
in the state capitol last year.

15:49.023 --> 15:51.115
That was you guys, right,
the, uh, the 126?

15:51.117 --> 15:54.193
Well, not just us,
but we were there, yeah.

15:54.195 --> 15:56.696
Y'all always seem
to get the big ones, huh?

15:56.698 --> 15:58.289
Judging by your Instagram.

15:58.291 --> 16:02.868
Uh, you know, life downtown.
Never a dull moment.

16:02.870 --> 16:05.855
Well, maybe sometimes
a dull moment, eh?

16:05.857 --> 16:07.173
(Marjan chuckles)

16:09.210 --> 16:11.785
Must be pretty rewarding, huh?

16:11.787 --> 16:13.471
Doing work
that actually matters.

16:14.532 --> 16:15.956
Helping people.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.384
Yeah, it's not always
an action movie, though.

16:18.386 --> 16:20.019
Yeah, I know what you mean.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.221
I'm a veteran. Army.

16:22.223 --> 16:23.982
Thank you for your service.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.132
MAN:
That's why I'm here, actually,

16:25.134 --> 16:27.652
uh, to continue
being of service.

16:27.654 --> 16:32.064
Is there, like, uh,
an application I can fill out
or something?

16:32.066 --> 16:34.475
Uh, we don't really
have applications,

16:34.477 --> 16:36.810
but I can, I can
get you an interest card

16:36.812 --> 16:37.829
if you just
hang back for a sec.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.664
That'll be great.
Thank you.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.040
MARJAN: Yeah.

16:42.744 --> 16:44.419
(exhales)

16:52.403 --> 16:55.013
This, uh, this has
all the websites on it.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.163
It should help get you started.

16:56.165 --> 16:57.998
Will do. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.392
No worries.

17:04.098 --> 17:06.524
Is there something else
I can help you with?

17:08.010 --> 17:10.236
No. Thank you.

17:11.939 --> 17:13.439
Alright. Good luck.

17:13.441 --> 17:15.366
Maybe see you out there
on the field one day.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.161
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You just might, huh?

17:28.364 --> 17:29.863
Hey, Sara. How's it going?

17:29.865 --> 17:31.549
Hmm, city planner's killing me.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.626
He wants
the new budget by Friday.

17:33.628 --> 17:36.387
And, no, we don't have room
for pizza parties.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.947
Hmm. Well, you know,
this room is called

17:37.949 --> 17:39.115
the break room for a reason.

17:39.117 --> 17:41.142
And yet you brought your laptop.

17:42.044 --> 17:44.896
(scoffs) I did. Um...

17:44.898 --> 17:46.898
There was something I want
to talk to you about, actually.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.566
-SARA: Mm-hmm.
-Linus McKinley.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.401
You know the boy who called
about his math homework?

17:50.403 --> 17:51.069
SARA: Mm-hmm.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.311
Well, he called again.

17:52.313 --> 17:55.389
-What, he have a history quiz?
-(laughs) No.

17:55.391 --> 17:59.135
He burned some macaroni
in his great-grandmother's dish.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.137
It was in the middle
of a school day, though,

18:01.139 --> 18:03.414
and his mom was asleep
in the next room.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.659
I see.

18:06.661 --> 18:08.544
So what do you think?

18:10.315 --> 18:11.831
-Listen.
-(laptop beeps)

18:11.833 --> 18:14.092
LINUS' MOM (over laptop):
<i> 9-1-1? Why are you</i>
<i> calling 9-1-1?</i>

18:14.094 --> 18:16.377
LINUS (over laptop):
<i> I burned your dish.</i>
<i> I didn't know how to clean it.</i>

18:16.379 --> 18:18.262
LINUS' MOM:
<i> That is not something</i>
<i> you call 9-1-1 for.</i>

18:18.264 --> 18:21.490
<i> You only call 9-1-1</i>
<i> in emergen-shees.</i>

18:21.492 --> 18:23.159
<i> Darn it, Linus,</i>
<i> they can arrest you for that.</i>

18:23.161 --> 18:24.585
<i> Give me the phone. Hello?</i>

18:24.587 --> 18:25.995
GRACE (over laptop):
<i> Mrs. McKinley. Hi.</i>

18:26.106 --> 18:28.648
<i>This is, uh, Grace Ryder</i>
<i>from Austin Emergency Services.</i>

18:28.650 --> 18:31.834
<i> Don't worry.</i>
<i> I can assure you nobody</i>
<i> is getting arrested today.</i>

18:31.836 --> 18:34.261
LINUS' MOM:
<i> I'm so sorry.</i>
<i> My "fun" knows better.</i>

18:34.263 --> 18:35.780
<i> -He won't trouble you--</i>
-(key clacks)

18:35.782 --> 18:38.783
Did you hear that? She said,
"My 'fun' knows better."

18:38.785 --> 18:40.359
Could've been
a slip of the tongue.

18:40.361 --> 18:43.955
Hmm. I think she's
slurring her words here.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.365
And I pulled her file.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.851
She got a DWI six years ago.

18:48.853 --> 18:50.186
Was the kid in the car with her?

18:50.188 --> 18:52.279
No, this was after the divorce.

18:52.281 --> 18:54.132
So according to her statement
to law enforcement,

18:54.134 --> 18:56.192
she, um, said
he was at his father's.

18:56.194 --> 18:57.593
What do you suggest we do?

18:58.954 --> 19:01.288
I think we send
a cruiser to the house.

19:01.290 --> 19:03.641
Maybe just
for a wellness check.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.050
You could do that.

19:05.052 --> 19:07.052
Is there any reason I wouldn't?

19:07.054 --> 19:09.463
You may well be right.
You usually are.

19:09.465 --> 19:11.632
But if you're wrong
and you send a cop
to that house,

19:11.634 --> 19:14.968
if they find so much as
a pointy object outta place...

19:14.970 --> 19:16.637
They'll call child services.

19:16.639 --> 19:17.846
And once they're involved,

19:17.848 --> 19:19.448
you're opening a Pandora's box.

19:20.809 --> 19:22.401
This is your call
to make, Grace.

19:22.403 --> 19:23.977
You have my full support.

19:23.979 --> 19:25.538
Whatever you decide.

19:26.908 --> 19:28.541
-Thanks.
-SARA: Mm-hmm.

19:37.159 --> 19:39.326
Why do I feel like
I'm going to my own funeral?

19:39.328 --> 19:41.161
Just breathe, Marwani,
you'll be fine.

19:41.163 --> 19:43.088
They're totally gonna
suspend me, aren't they?

19:43.090 --> 19:44.573
Look, in my experience
with these things,

19:44.575 --> 19:47.760
it's best to just agree
to whatever they say
and move on.

19:47.762 --> 19:51.263
Hmm, that's funny.
I remember you doing
the exact opposite last year.

19:51.265 --> 19:53.933
Yeah, I learned my lesson,
and so should you.

19:53.935 --> 19:56.027
-Oh, and also, don't do that.
-Do what?

19:56.029 --> 19:58.845
The thing where you
point out the actual facts.

19:58.847 --> 19:59.697
They-they hate that.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.924
That is not a thing I do.

20:01.926 --> 20:03.108
Yeah, it is,
more than you think.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.610
Okay, well, even if
I occasionally do it,

20:04.612 --> 20:06.929
which I dispute,
it's only when I'm right.

20:06.931 --> 20:09.114
They don't care who's right.

20:09.116 --> 20:12.043
So, whatever they do,
whatever they say,

20:12.045 --> 20:13.285
whatever buttons they push,

20:13.529 --> 20:16.789
you need to resist the urge
to say something snarky,

20:16.791 --> 20:20.443
which we both know for you
is a potential growth area.

20:20.445 --> 20:21.427
Is it, though?

20:22.222 --> 20:24.964
So, j-just lock it up.

20:24.966 --> 20:26.966
Locking it up, Cap.

20:26.968 --> 20:29.227
(door opens,
footsteps approach)

20:29.229 --> 20:30.394
They're ready for you.

20:31.789 --> 20:33.564
"They're" ready for us?

20:33.566 --> 20:34.690
OWEN:
Hmm.

20:35.401 --> 20:36.525
(exhales)

20:42.316 --> 20:44.742
MITCH GERALDS:
Just be strong, Lila.
I'm right here.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.393
(door closes)

20:46.395 --> 20:48.429
ASHA:
Captain Strand.
Firefighter Marwani.

20:48.431 --> 20:51.398
You remember
Mitch and Lila Geralds?

20:51.400 --> 20:54.994
Yeah, um, I thought
you two were divorced.

20:54.996 --> 20:57.646
Oh, we've decided to reconcile.

20:57.648 --> 20:59.906
If any good has come
from the distress

20:59.908 --> 21:01.408
my wife has endured,

21:01.410 --> 21:03.986
-it's that we're back together.
-(slight chuckle)

21:03.988 --> 21:06.155
Oh, well, that's good.

21:06.157 --> 21:08.248
Which is why
we're not interested

21:08.250 --> 21:09.600
in destroying your life.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.252
The Geralds feel like
we can get this
all resolved right here.

21:12.254 --> 21:14.163
How is he not in jail?
How's he not in jail?

21:14.165 --> 21:15.664
ASHA:
Uh, Captain Strand.

21:15.666 --> 21:16.923
No, he kidnapped his wife,

21:16.925 --> 21:18.776
he illegally secured a home,

21:18.778 --> 21:20.503
and drove it down two freeways

21:20.505 --> 21:21.762
without yielding
to law enforcement,

21:21.781 --> 21:24.507
putting his wife, the public,
and my team at risk.

21:24.509 --> 21:26.951
-How is he
sitting in this room?
-They gave me a fine.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.194
They gave you a fine.
Not even traffic school?

21:29.196 --> 21:31.697
Oh, Captain Strand,
that's not why we're here, so.

21:31.699 --> 21:32.515
That-that's right.

21:32.517 --> 21:33.516
The reason we're here

21:33.684 --> 21:35.960
is because of
my inappropriate language.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.021
It was unprofessional
and unacceptable.

21:39.023 --> 21:40.706
My job was to protect you,

21:40.708 --> 21:42.133
not insult you, Mrs. Geralds.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.302
What I said,
calling you a crazy lady,

21:44.304 --> 21:47.379
it was out of line
and it was messed up.

21:47.381 --> 21:48.306
And hurtful.

21:49.867 --> 21:50.716
And hurtful.

21:50.718 --> 21:53.102
And probably a little sexist.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.205
That certainly wasn't my intent.

21:56.207 --> 21:59.041
But I am so ashamed
I said it.

21:59.043 --> 22:01.802
I'm sorry.
Truly, Mrs. Geralds.

22:01.804 --> 22:03.303
That was beautiful.

22:03.305 --> 22:05.047
Wasn't that beautiful?

22:05.049 --> 22:06.065
Very heartfelt.

22:06.067 --> 22:07.808
I could feel the sincerity.

22:07.810 --> 22:09.660
-MARJAN: It's real.
-MITCH: Good.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.287
You should do it just like that.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.664
Do what?

22:13.666 --> 22:16.000
What you just did.
Apologize.

22:16.727 --> 22:17.984
I just did.

22:17.986 --> 22:19.912
Uh, the Geralds
would like you

22:19.914 --> 22:22.197
to publicly post your apology

22:22.199 --> 22:23.399
on social media.

22:23.401 --> 22:26.827
We understand you have
five million followers?

22:26.829 --> 22:28.420
Uh, Firefox, right?

22:28.422 --> 22:29.830
5.2 million.

22:29.832 --> 22:31.790
You wanna publicly
shame her?

22:31.792 --> 22:32.925
She saved your life.

22:32.927 --> 22:35.077
I don't see where the shame is.

22:35.079 --> 22:36.354
Unless she didn't mean it.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.021
-I meant it.
-MITCH: Great.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.022
So just do it like that.

22:38.249 --> 22:40.916
And, uh, make sure
to tag our GoFundMe.

22:40.918 --> 22:43.085
Your GoFundMe.
For-for what?

22:43.087 --> 22:45.011
We lost our house
in this tragedy.

22:45.013 --> 22:46.105
We're homeless now.

22:46.107 --> 22:48.849
Yes, because this maniac
drove your house

22:48.851 --> 22:50.183
into an overpass.

22:50.185 --> 22:52.761
Yeah, I feel like you kinda
herded me into that.

22:52.763 --> 22:53.854
I herded you?
You were herded?

22:53.856 --> 22:56.115
-Cap. Cap.
-Yeah.

22:56.117 --> 22:58.450
Look, um, I don't
really have a problem

22:58.452 --> 23:02.621
making this apology public,
if that's what you want.

23:02.623 --> 23:03.956
I'm just, I'm-I'm not sure

23:03.958 --> 23:06.275
I feel comfortable
soliciting money

23:06.277 --> 23:07.868
from my followers.

23:07.870 --> 23:09.035
That's up to you.

23:09.037 --> 23:10.796
But if we're not a charity,

23:10.798 --> 23:14.283
we'll probably have to end up
being plaintiffs.

23:14.285 --> 23:17.043
LILA GERALDS:
We sure would like this
to be over.

23:17.045 --> 23:19.379
But it doesn't have to be.

23:19.381 --> 23:21.399
♪

23:25.630 --> 23:28.313
We're just simple folks
with simple dreams.

23:28.315 --> 23:32.151
Of love, family,
and a roof over our heads.

23:32.153 --> 23:34.412
But due to the reckless actions
of law enforcement

23:34.414 --> 23:37.915
<i> and the fire department,</i>
<i> we lost everything.</i>

23:37.917 --> 23:40.400
<i> All we're asking for here</i>
<i> is $750,000--</i>

23:40.402 --> 23:41.585
I don't know, you guys,
I-I don't think

23:41.587 --> 23:42.995
I can get behind this.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.314
Well, look, Marj, you don't
have to get behind it, okay?

23:45.316 --> 23:46.331
-You just have to tag it.
-MATEO: It's true.

23:46.333 --> 23:47.925
I mean, one click
and it's done.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.668
Tagging it is
as good as endorsing

23:49.670 --> 23:51.170
everything they're saying,
and it's just,

23:51.172 --> 23:52.721
it's too gross, I think...

23:54.325 --> 23:55.916
I think I need to take a stand.

23:55.918 --> 23:57.676
Hell, yeah, dude.
Good for you.

23:57.678 --> 23:59.161
Uh, no, not good for you.

23:59.163 --> 24:01.330
And, Nancy, please
do not encourage her.

24:01.332 --> 24:02.273
She refuses to do this,

24:02.275 --> 24:04.349
and she's facing
suspension or worse.

24:04.351 --> 24:06.927
You can't expect me
to hold my nose and sign off

24:06.929 --> 24:08.187
on something
that I don't believe in.

24:08.189 --> 24:10.096
Oh really?
Because that is exactly

24:10.098 --> 24:11.507
what you asked
Cap to do last year,

24:11.525 --> 24:13.600
when you drove out to him
in the middle of a blizzard.

24:13.602 --> 24:15.360
Yeah, that's right. I mean,
you shamed him pretty good

24:15.362 --> 24:17.270
into signing
that apology letter
for punching Billy.

24:17.272 --> 24:19.198
I mean, he signed it
and he wasn't even sorry.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.184
(grunts)
That's the whole point.
I am sorry.

24:22.186 --> 24:25.278
If this was a pure,
untainted apology,

24:25.280 --> 24:26.872
I would do it in a heartbeat.

24:26.874 --> 24:29.858
Look, Marj, I get it.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.785
It sucks.

24:31.787 --> 24:33.195
But we need you in the 126.

24:33.197 --> 24:35.881
Hell, all of Austin
needs you in the 126.

24:35.883 --> 24:37.533
Not as much as
people need Firefox.

24:37.535 --> 24:40.035
You know, most of my followers
are young people.

24:40.037 --> 24:41.795
They look up to me.

24:41.797 --> 24:44.297
Do you have
any idea how often
they stop me in the street

24:44.299 --> 24:47.151
just to say thank you
for being who I am?

24:47.153 --> 24:49.061
And if they watch me
sign off on a lie,

24:49.063 --> 24:51.489
what kind of example
does that set for them?

24:51.491 --> 24:54.066
Yeah, but is it really better
than watching you get fired?

24:54.068 --> 24:55.493
Honestly? I...

24:56.496 --> 24:57.495
I don't know.

25:01.575 --> 25:03.892
JUDD:
Can you believe
Marjan got in trouble

25:03.894 --> 25:05.836
for callin' a crazy lady crazy?

25:05.838 --> 25:07.320
Hmm. That's a shame.

25:07.489 --> 25:10.065
I would shudder to think about
what they would've done to me

25:10.067 --> 25:11.342
and Garrity for half the stuff

25:11.344 --> 25:12.918
we said to each other
back in the day.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.970
GRACE: Hmm.
Yeah, no doubt about it.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.517
No doubt about what?

25:19.519 --> 25:20.184
GRACE: Huh?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.501
-Huh?
-(Charlie coos)

25:21.503 --> 25:24.763
Oh, um, about what you
were saying just now.

25:24.765 --> 25:26.006
Which was what, darling?

25:26.008 --> 25:29.251
Oh, you were
decrying the state

25:29.253 --> 25:33.013
of PC culture run amok
and whatnot.

25:33.015 --> 25:34.448
And "whatnot."

25:36.093 --> 25:37.034
I didn't hear what you said.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.184
(both chuckle)

25:38.186 --> 25:39.928
So maybe
somebody else's gears

25:39.930 --> 25:41.430
are grinding a little bit.

25:41.432 --> 25:43.265
I mean, you've been
drying that same plate

25:43.267 --> 25:44.875
for quite a spell now, Gracie.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.418
-GRACE: Hmm.
-What's going on?

25:47.195 --> 25:48.695
(clicks tongue)

25:48.697 --> 25:50.030
Well, there's this boy.

25:50.032 --> 25:51.031
JUDD: Mm-hmm.

25:51.033 --> 25:52.107
GRACE:
Sweet little boy.

25:52.109 --> 25:54.534
He keeps calling in to 9-1-1,

25:54.536 --> 25:55.778
uh, for little stuff.

25:56.038 --> 25:59.131
Help with his math homework
and-and cleaning the dishes.

25:59.133 --> 26:00.799
Hell, I should've
thought of that.

26:00.801 --> 26:02.208
(chuckles) Stop it.

26:02.210 --> 26:06.230
I really think somethin'
might be going on at home.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.141
Like somethin' bad,
but if I'm wrong

26:09.143 --> 26:11.126
and I send a cop over there,

26:11.128 --> 26:13.487
then they could take
that boy from his mom.

26:14.222 --> 26:15.555
-Scary.
-Yeah.

26:15.557 --> 26:18.909
It is scary, but it's not
as scary as me being right

26:18.911 --> 26:20.819
and then not doing anything.

26:20.821 --> 26:23.989
And the not knowing is--
That's what's bothering me.

26:23.991 --> 26:25.749
Well, it sounds like
you need to find out.

26:27.494 --> 26:29.328
You know, it does.
It does sound like that.

26:29.330 --> 26:31.404
Thank you so much,
my sweet husband.

26:31.406 --> 26:34.483
How do you suggest
I go about doing that?

26:34.485 --> 26:37.077
I imagine you have
this boy's address, yes?

26:37.079 --> 26:38.670
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm. Okay.

26:38.672 --> 26:41.673
So why don't you go
knock on the door,
find out for yourself?

26:41.675 --> 26:45.418
And if you're wrong,
there's no harm, no foul.

26:45.420 --> 26:47.329
-Oh, you mean now?
-Mm-hmm.

26:47.331 --> 26:49.589
Well, what about Charlie?
It's past her bedtime.

26:49.591 --> 26:51.850
Well, she sleeps better
in the car anyway.

26:51.852 --> 26:53.277
Come on, mama.

26:53.762 --> 26:54.987
Let's go.

27:05.683 --> 27:07.699
Have I officially gone off
the deep end doing this?

27:07.701 --> 27:11.128
Sweetheart, you are the best
in the world at what you do.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.173
If ain't nothing goin' on,
then no big deal.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.449
Okay.

27:16.451 --> 27:18.710
I appreciate you saying that.
I needed to hear it.

27:18.712 --> 27:19.862
Alright, let's go.

27:19.864 --> 27:21.530
Oh, uh, no, not you.

27:21.532 --> 27:23.123
Y'all stay here, okay?
I'll be back.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.383
Wait, what?

27:24.385 --> 27:26.218
The last thing this boy needs

27:26.220 --> 27:28.036
is a big, scary man
showing up on his porch.

27:28.038 --> 27:29.129
I'm a big, scary man?

27:29.131 --> 27:30.539
You are a little scary, Judd.

27:30.541 --> 27:31.890
-Oh. (sighs)
-Just a little bit.

27:31.892 --> 27:33.558
Stay here, okay?
I'll be back.

27:33.560 --> 27:34.735
(Judd clears throat)

27:38.732 --> 27:41.283
You think I'm scary? Hmm?

27:42.828 --> 27:44.411
(Grace exhales)

27:49.243 --> 27:51.377
LINUS:
Is somebody out there?

27:52.062 --> 27:53.153
Yeah. Hey, Linus.

27:53.155 --> 27:55.589
Um, it's Grace from 9-1-1.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.258
Miss Grace!

27:59.828 --> 28:01.753
-Hi.
-LINUS: You're so pretty.

28:01.755 --> 28:03.071
I thought you'd be old.

28:03.073 --> 28:04.756
LINUS' MOM:
Linus, where are you, baby?

28:04.758 --> 28:06.124
I'm at the door, Mom.

28:06.126 --> 28:07.592
LINUS' MOM:
You should be
"blushing" your teeth.

28:07.594 --> 28:08.835
(body thuds)

28:08.837 --> 28:10.503
-LINUS: Mom!
-Ma'am?

28:10.505 --> 28:13.265
-Ma'am, this is Grace Ryder
from Austin Emergency.
-LINUS: Mom!

28:13.267 --> 28:16.268
GRACE:
Ma'am, is it okay
if I come in the house?

28:16.270 --> 28:18.320
LINUS:
Please, you have to help her!

28:19.699 --> 28:21.014
Draw four, Mama.

28:21.016 --> 28:22.182
Oh, that's cold.

28:22.184 --> 28:23.592
You know what?
You guys are little,

28:23.594 --> 28:25.703
little crazy-eights assassins,
is what you are.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.228
-(cell phone ringing)
-Oh.

28:27.230 --> 28:28.664
Saved by the bell.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.024
Hey, Gracie.

28:31.026 --> 28:32.935
Hey, did you teach my girls
how to card shark

28:32.937 --> 28:34.436
the last time you were here?

28:34.438 --> 28:35.713
GRACE (over phone):
<i> Tommy, I need your help.</i>

28:36.457 --> 28:37.197
Are you okay?

28:37.216 --> 28:38.364
Listen, I'm with a woman.

28:38.366 --> 28:39.624
She's a 30-something female.

28:39.626 --> 28:41.777
She was stumbling
and she was slurring her words.

28:41.779 --> 28:42.794
<i> And she's unconscious now.</i>

28:42.796 --> 28:44.704
Sharon? Sharon,
I need you to wake up.

28:44.706 --> 28:46.465
-TOMMY:<i> Gracie, where are you?</i>
-I'm in her house.

28:46.467 --> 28:48.784
It's a single-family residence
in Crestview.

28:48.786 --> 28:50.043
Why aren't you calling 9-1-1?

28:50.045 --> 28:51.377
GRACE:
<i> I did, but they're</i>
<i> 12 minutes out.</i>

28:51.379 --> 28:53.880
TOMMY:
<i> You said that--</i>
<i> that she was disoriented</i>

28:53.882 --> 28:54.898
<i> and slurring her words.</i>

28:54.900 --> 28:56.124
Could it be an OD?

28:56.126 --> 28:58.143
No. Her son said
she was clean and sober.

28:58.145 --> 29:00.386
I don't see any alcohol
or paraphernalia around.

29:00.388 --> 29:02.130
What else do you know
about her medical history?

29:02.132 --> 29:03.982
I don't know anything.
She's a stranger.

29:03.984 --> 29:06.392
<i> I know she's been</i>
<i> have headaches.</i>

29:06.394 --> 29:08.245
-Sharon, I need you to wake up.
-Okay, Gracie.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.247
<i> Gracie, I need you</i>
<i> to stay with me, okay?</i>

29:10.249 --> 29:11.974
Tell me about
her pupillary response.

29:11.976 --> 29:13.158
Her pupillary response?

29:13.160 --> 29:15.085
Yes. Are they
contracting or dilating?

29:15.087 --> 29:16.645
T, she's unconscious.
I told you.

29:16.647 --> 29:19.331
Okay.
You-you can still do it.
It's no big deal.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.925
It's not a big deal for you
because you're a paramedic.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.094
I'm a dispatcher,
and I don't know what I'm doing.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.504
So I need you
to walk me through it.

29:25.506 --> 29:27.765
Gracie, I need you
to take a deep breath.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.749
<i> Okay?</i>
<i> I am right here with you.</i>

29:29.751 --> 29:31.226
<i> Is she still breathing?</i>

29:33.439 --> 29:34.346
Yeah, she's breathing.

29:34.515 --> 29:36.106
Now, I-I need you
to take your phone

29:36.108 --> 29:38.350
<i> and turn on</i>
<i> the flashlight function.</i>

29:38.352 --> 29:40.093
-Alright, it's on.
-TOMMY:<i> Okay, good.</i>

29:40.095 --> 29:42.337
Take your fingers,
lift each one of her eyelids.

29:42.339 --> 29:45.173
<i> Shine the light. Tell me</i>
<i> what her pupils are doing.</i>

29:45.175 --> 29:47.025
GRACE:
Alright, her right eye
contracted normally.

29:47.027 --> 29:48.619
TOMMY:
<i> Alright, the left?</i>

29:50.697 --> 29:52.014
No, it's not contracting.

29:52.016 --> 29:54.683
Okay, Gracie,
she's having a stroke.

29:54.685 --> 29:56.701
-Oh, God.
-TOMMY:<i> It's okay.</i>
<i> You got this.</i>

29:56.703 --> 29:58.962
<i> -Can you get her into the car?</i>
-I can. Judd is here.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.613
But shouldn't we wait
for the ambulance?

30:00.615 --> 30:03.358
It's faster if y'all
take her there yourselves.

30:03.360 --> 30:05.710
With a stroke, time is brain.

30:05.712 --> 30:06.804
-(shudders)
<i> -Gracie.</i>

30:06.806 --> 30:07.971
<i> Can you do this?</i>

30:07.973 --> 30:10.215
Yeah. Yeah. We're on our way.

30:10.217 --> 30:11.383
Grace, y'all get
in the backseat,

30:11.385 --> 30:12.884
I'm gonna lock her up in front.

30:12.886 --> 30:14.294
GRACE: Okay.

30:14.296 --> 30:15.979
Linus, come on, baby.
You're with me.

30:22.229 --> 30:23.728
Alright, let's go.

30:23.730 --> 30:25.697
(engine starts)

30:30.979 --> 30:32.454
Hey, Linus.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.314
Do you like candy bars?

30:34.316 --> 30:35.223
Yeah.

30:35.317 --> 30:36.408
Yeah?
What's your favorite kind?

30:36.727 --> 30:40.062
I like all of them,
except the kind with coconut.

30:40.064 --> 30:42.172
Me, too. I hate
the ones with coconut.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.066
When I came in here,
I seen a vending machine

30:44.068 --> 30:45.250
that looked like
it had candy bars

30:45.252 --> 30:47.402
about the size of your arm.

30:47.404 --> 30:48.587
Wanna see if we
go rustle one up?

30:48.589 --> 30:52.165
Does that sound like
something you wanna do?

30:52.167 --> 30:54.259
Let's go.
Y'all want anything?

30:54.261 --> 30:56.186
Mm-mmm. I'm okay, babe.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.355
How are you holding up?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.749
Ask me when
his mama is out of surgery.

31:00.751 --> 31:03.101
Before you got here,
the doctor said
that all the headaches

31:03.103 --> 31:05.178
that she'd been having
up until now

31:05.180 --> 31:07.255
were probably
mini strokes...

31:07.257 --> 31:09.424
-Oh.
-...just leading up
to the main event.

31:09.426 --> 31:11.351
It's a good thing
you were there tonight.

31:11.353 --> 31:13.762
It's a good thing
you were there tonight,
Tommy,

31:13.764 --> 31:14.687
when I called you.

31:14.689 --> 31:15.931
Anytime.

31:15.933 --> 31:17.249
I'm sorry...

31:18.210 --> 31:19.960
that I bit your head
off tonight.

31:21.029 --> 31:22.954
You did not bite my head off.

31:22.956 --> 31:24.606
No. Well, okay.

31:24.608 --> 31:28.034
Yes, just, but-- you--
Just-just a little nibble.

31:28.036 --> 31:29.428
That's all.

31:31.873 --> 31:33.682
It's just, it's so different...

31:35.060 --> 31:37.377
being on the other side
of the call

31:37.379 --> 31:40.213
when I got my headset in,
and I just...

31:40.215 --> 31:42.232
I'm in front of the screen,
at least...

31:42.234 --> 31:45.127
I-I feel some
sense of--

31:45.129 --> 31:46.236
-Control.
-Yeah.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.147
But when it's just all there
in front of you,

31:49.149 --> 31:50.966
you feel completely--

31:50.968 --> 31:52.317
Out of control.

31:52.319 --> 31:53.802
I don't know how you do it.

31:53.804 --> 31:55.078
You know this,

31:55.080 --> 31:58.064
I never walk into
a situation blind either.

31:58.066 --> 32:00.751
I have a great dispatcher
who is prepping me

32:00.753 --> 32:02.252
on what I'm up against.

32:04.481 --> 32:07.925
Either way,
I really do appreciate you.

32:07.927 --> 32:09.426
Anytime.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.262
And always.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.430
-So, listen. (clears throat)
-Hmm?

32:13.432 --> 32:14.932
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell

32:14.934 --> 32:16.324
you were doing
at that woman's house?

32:16.326 --> 32:17.159
Oh, God.

32:17.327 --> 32:18.326
I'm gonna tell you
tomorrow, okay?

32:18.328 --> 32:20.253
I promise. I promise.

32:20.255 --> 32:22.397
I'm looking for Grace Ryder.

32:23.834 --> 32:25.108
Is his mom gonna be okay?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.611
We were able to remove the clot
and repair the artery.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.612
What about brain damage?

32:28.930 --> 32:30.172
DOCTOR:
We were able
to restore blood flow

32:30.340 --> 32:32.190
before there was any
permanent tissue destruction.

32:32.192 --> 32:34.192
I'm confident
she'll make a full recovery.

32:34.194 --> 32:36.027
-Thank God.
-DOCTOR: She's very lucky

32:36.029 --> 32:38.180
you got her here
in the golden hour.

32:38.182 --> 32:39.456
If it had been 20 minutes later,

32:39.458 --> 32:41.441
it would have been
a different story.

32:41.443 --> 32:43.126
We're moving her
to recovery now.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.629
Her son should be able
to see her in a few hours.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.964
Thank you, doc.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.467
How about that?

32:50.469 --> 32:51.969
(chuckles)

32:54.364 --> 32:57.199
Hardwood's all original,
exposed brick.

32:57.201 --> 33:00.035
And just a stumble
and a bumble from 6th Street.

33:00.037 --> 33:01.870
MAN:
It's nice.

33:01.872 --> 33:05.373
BUILDING MANAGER:
It'll be a lot better than nice
when the reno is done.

33:05.375 --> 33:07.892
You won't find anything
like it for $4,800.

33:07.894 --> 33:09.653
Not with its
own parking space.

33:12.049 --> 33:13.573
You married, Mr. Smith?

33:13.993 --> 33:15.826
Yeah.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.160
BUILDING MANAGER:
Any kids?

33:17.162 --> 33:18.478
Yeah, I have a son.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.830
-He's six.
-(cell phone ringing)

33:19.832 --> 33:21.999
Oh. I apologize.

33:22.001 --> 33:24.001
Would you excuse me?

33:24.003 --> 33:27.129
Hello? Yes. Mm-hmm.

33:28.232 --> 33:30.565
Full disclosure,
I'm showing it now.

33:30.567 --> 33:34.678
But if it's still available,
I can do 9:15.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.763
Okay. See you then.

33:38.166 --> 33:39.924
So what do you say?

33:39.926 --> 33:41.593
Should I cancel my 9:15?

33:41.595 --> 33:42.686
It's tempting,

33:43.004 --> 33:45.731
but I think $4,800 is
a little too rich for my blood.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.006
But I appreciate your time.

33:47.008 --> 33:48.174
Uh, no worries.

33:48.176 --> 33:50.027
Um, I'll show you out.

34:00.113 --> 34:02.205
-(siren wailing)
-(horn blares)

34:08.029 --> 34:09.454
-Help!
-OWEN: Alright, Judd.

34:09.456 --> 34:11.364
You swing the ladder
up to the building.

34:11.366 --> 34:13.366
Marwani, Strickland,
you're going up.

34:13.368 --> 34:15.201
Everybody else,
put a supply line.

34:15.203 --> 34:16.611
Hey, y'all be quick
on your toes, too.

34:16.613 --> 34:18.963
This looks like it's gonna
flashover any minute.

34:18.965 --> 34:20.465
Cap, that is one hungry beast.

34:20.467 --> 34:22.059
-Yeah, a little too hungry.
-JUDD: Yep.

34:23.954 --> 34:25.120
WOMAN:
Help!

34:25.122 --> 34:26.137
We need help over here!

34:26.139 --> 34:28.065
MARJAN:
Is there anyone else up there?

34:28.067 --> 34:30.400
My neighbor, Blake.
We can't get out!

34:31.070 --> 34:33.295
(woman screams)

34:33.297 --> 34:36.198
Stay where you are.
Stay where you are.

34:38.635 --> 34:40.577
DISPATCHER (over radio):
<i> Engine 126, I have</i>
<i> a caller on the line</i>

34:40.579 --> 34:43.413
<i>reporting additional flames on</i>
<i>the south end of the structure.</i>

34:43.415 --> 34:44.823
OFFICER (over radio):
<i> We have closures going up</i>

34:44.825 --> 34:46.474
<i> at South Avenue</i>
<i> and 1st Street.</i>

34:46.476 --> 34:49.586
DISPATCHER:

OFFICER:<i> EMS 150,</i>
<i> tracking four minutes out.</i>

34:52.091 --> 34:55.217
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:57.003 --> 34:58.762
MARJAN:
Ma'am!

34:58.764 --> 35:00.263
WOMAN:
We're back here!

35:00.265 --> 35:02.224
-Blake, we have to go.
-No, I can't.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.327
He won't let go,
he's too scared.

35:05.329 --> 35:06.770
PAUL:
Okay. Ma'am, ma'am.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.105
Why don't you
come with me, okay?

35:08.273 --> 35:10.014
I'll get you to the ladder,
and our friend will take you

35:10.016 --> 35:11.808
the rest of the way down.
Alright?

35:11.810 --> 35:13.001
MARJAN: Sir!

35:13.003 --> 35:14.277
I need you to
come with me, okay?

35:14.279 --> 35:15.353
No, no, I can't.

35:15.597 --> 35:16.929
MARJAN:
The whole building's
about to go.

35:16.931 --> 35:18.006
We have to evacuate now.

35:18.008 --> 35:19.432
No, don't-- No!
Don't touch me.

35:19.601 --> 35:23.120
MARJAN:
Sir, I am ordering you
to let go and come with me.

35:23.122 --> 35:26.514
I can't. I can't do heights.
I'd rather die.

35:26.516 --> 35:28.166
OWEN (over radio):
<i> Marwani, do you copy?</i>

35:28.168 --> 35:30.109
-MARJAN: Copy, Cap.
-What the hell's
going on up there?

35:30.111 --> 35:31.461
The whole place
is about flashover.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.689
MARJAN:
It's just that the occupant's
being a little...

35:34.691 --> 35:39.469
Um, the occupant has very strong
reservations about leaving.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.454
Reservations? Have him get
the hell outta there!

35:41.456 --> 35:43.715
MARJAN:
Sir, look, I know you're afraid,

35:43.717 --> 35:46.959
but I-I-I need you to be
reasonable with me, please.

35:46.961 --> 35:48.036
No, just leave me.

35:48.038 --> 35:50.147
PAUL:
Hey, you. We ain't waitin'!

35:50.149 --> 35:51.982
MARJAN:
Ooh! (yelps)

35:51.984 --> 35:54.133
PAUL:
Marjan, grab him.
Let's go.

35:54.135 --> 35:56.027
Marj, we gotta go now.

36:02.068 --> 36:03.827
Well, unless you guys
have any questions,

36:03.829 --> 36:05.069
I think that about sums it up.

36:05.071 --> 36:06.163
I'll see you guys
back at the office, okay?

36:06.165 --> 36:08.582
I'm gonna stick around,
type up my notes.

36:12.337 --> 36:13.244
(knocking)

36:13.397 --> 36:15.914
Miss Fulton.
You got a minute?

36:15.916 --> 36:18.400
Uh, that's a bit presumptuous.

36:18.402 --> 36:20.402
Well, look, um,
I apologize for the drop-in,

36:20.404 --> 36:21.178
but I really feel like
this can't wait.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.829
I meant that you called me Miss.

36:23.831 --> 36:25.164
How do you know it's not Missus?

36:25.166 --> 36:26.241
Well, you wear a ring
on your right ring finger,

36:26.243 --> 36:27.184
but your left pointer, and, um,

36:27.186 --> 36:29.093
and another one
on your right thumb,

36:29.095 --> 36:31.646
but there's no metal
where the wedding band goes.

36:33.341 --> 36:37.009
Are you able to look through
solid objects, firefighter?

36:37.011 --> 36:39.270
No. I noticed
in our first interview.

36:39.272 --> 36:41.089
-I notice things.
-Huh.

36:41.091 --> 36:42.699
Must come in handy
in the field.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.992
Yeah, from time to time.

36:45.445 --> 36:48.872
Hey, did you go
to Bishop Cross in Round Rock?

36:48.874 --> 36:49.948
No.

36:49.950 --> 36:51.541
Texas A&M, maybe?

36:51.877 --> 36:52.951
No.

36:52.953 --> 36:53.877
God, it's killing me.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.453
I know I know you
from somewhere.

36:55.455 --> 36:56.438
I bet I know what it is.

36:56.606 --> 36:57.881
Fox 11 did a segment
on me last year,

36:57.883 --> 36:59.123
after the blizzard.

36:59.125 --> 37:01.109
I saved a local girl,
got trapped in the gym,

37:01.111 --> 37:02.944
and the morning guy said
I was the, uh,

37:02.946 --> 37:03.869
"Hero on Fire and Ice."

37:03.871 --> 37:04.796
Which is kinda dumb, but, uh--

37:04.798 --> 37:06.297
Yeah, that's not it.

37:06.299 --> 37:07.557
Okay.
I'd love to stay in here

37:07.559 --> 37:09.133
and throw darts
at the wall all day, but--

37:09.135 --> 37:11.728
But you wanna talk
about your friend Marwani.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.304
My best friend.

37:13.306 --> 37:15.381
Look, I'm sorry,
but I'm not at liberty

37:15.383 --> 37:18.142
to discuss an investigation
of an ongoing complaint.

37:18.144 --> 37:19.794
I don't wanna discuss
that complaint.

37:19.796 --> 37:20.645
I'm here to file a new one.

37:20.647 --> 37:21.646
-Oh?
-PAUL: Yeah.

37:21.889 --> 37:23.465
What the department
is asking of Marjan--

37:23.467 --> 37:24.466
demanding--

37:24.484 --> 37:26.392
it's not an apology.
It's extortion.

37:26.394 --> 37:28.970
I think that's
a slight exaggeration.

37:28.972 --> 37:31.248
No, it is a money grab,
pure and simple.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.417
Marwani is the best firefighter
I have ever served with.

37:34.419 --> 37:37.420
Going back to
my probie days in Chicago.

37:38.482 --> 37:39.998
And I can see
by the look in your eye

37:40.000 --> 37:42.425
that you know
that this is some bull.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.152
Well, you are
observant, firefighter.

37:44.154 --> 37:45.637
I will give you that.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.322
I'm begging you.

37:47.324 --> 37:50.842
Please.
Do the right thing
and stop this.

37:50.844 --> 37:54.178
Alright, I'm gonna put
my tablet down on the table here

37:54.180 --> 37:55.830
while I check my phone.

37:55.832 --> 37:57.499
And, um, there's no telling

37:57.501 --> 38:01.093
what such an observant fellow
like yourself might observe.

38:01.095 --> 38:02.445
-What is this?
-ASHA: I'm sorry.

38:02.447 --> 38:05.507
I am not at liberty to discuss
the confidential email

38:05.509 --> 38:07.701
that I wrote
to the AFD this morning.

38:10.772 --> 38:14.398
PAUL:
"Firefighter Marwani represents
every ideal the AFD stands for.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.126
"It is my recommendation
that the department

38:16.128 --> 38:18.128
"deem her
previous apology sufficient

38:18.130 --> 38:20.797
and close the matter
without further reprimand."

38:20.799 --> 38:22.782
Wait. You wrote this?

38:22.784 --> 38:24.283
This is amazing.

38:24.285 --> 38:26.118
I wouldn't get too excited.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.379
My phone rang about
five minutes after I hit send.

38:28.381 --> 38:31.049
The chief said they have
no interest in a lawsuit

38:31.051 --> 38:32.534
with the Geralds.

38:32.536 --> 38:35.795
So Marwani does the public
mea culpa and tags the site

38:35.797 --> 38:38.023
or they throw her to the wolves.

38:39.225 --> 38:42.235
-Oh.
-Yeah. I'm truly sorry.

38:42.896 --> 38:44.395
Well, I, um...

38:44.397 --> 38:46.214
I appreciate you
going to bat for her.

38:46.216 --> 38:48.658
Please wish her luck,
whatever she decides.

38:51.905 --> 38:53.388
I got it.

38:53.390 --> 38:56.574
Were you in Mrs. Templeton's
sixth grade class?

38:56.576 --> 38:57.892
Hidden Oaks.

38:57.894 --> 38:59.669
Yeah.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.895
I knew I recognized you.

39:00.897 --> 39:02.005
Wait a minute,
you were there?

39:02.007 --> 39:04.232
In Chicago?

39:04.234 --> 39:05.991
That's funny, 'cause I-I
don't remember an Asha.

39:05.993 --> 39:06.843
It's my middle name.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.994
Do you remember a Jasmine?

39:08.996 --> 39:10.254
Who moved in seventh grade.

39:10.256 --> 39:14.351
To Texas, where I
started going by Asha.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.978
Went through a little
identity thing as a tween.

39:17.914 --> 39:19.430
Yeah, I get that.

39:19.432 --> 39:21.432
But, wait, how-how the heck
did you recognize me?

39:21.434 --> 39:24.319
Please. A smile like that,
you don't forget.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.605
You haven't changed a bit.

39:27.607 --> 39:28.531
Huh.

39:31.036 --> 39:34.095
Hey, Firefox here.

39:34.097 --> 39:35.930
You guys know
I've always been about

39:35.932 --> 39:39.951
making people feel seen,
heard, and safe.

39:39.953 --> 39:42.787
Well, recently
I let you guys down.

39:42.789 --> 39:44.272
<i> I screwed up.</i>

39:44.274 --> 39:46.124
<i> In the heat</i>
<i> of a dangerous situation,</i>

39:46.126 --> 39:47.867
<i> I called a woman crazy.</i>

39:47.869 --> 39:49.386
<i> Her name is Lila Geralds,</i>

39:49.388 --> 39:51.946
<i> and she deserved</i>
<i> so much better than that.</i>

39:51.948 --> 39:54.391
<i> So for that, Lila, I'm sorry.</i>

39:54.393 --> 39:56.801
<i> I should never</i>
<i> have called you crazy.</i>

39:56.803 --> 39:59.396
<i> I should have called you</i>
<i> a greedy opportunist.</i>

39:59.398 --> 40:02.214
-Hmm. Nope.
-MARJAN:<i> With the full</i>
<i> blessing of the AFD,</i>

40:02.216 --> 40:04.884
<i> Lila and her husband</i>
<i> tried to coerce me</i>

40:04.886 --> 40:06.461
<i> to cash in on you guys.</i>

40:06.463 --> 40:07.404
<i> I can't work for a place</i>

40:07.722 --> 40:10.407
<i> that forces me</i>
<i> to compromise my integrity.</i>

40:10.409 --> 40:13.410
<i> That makes me feel unsafe</i>
<i> for being who I am.</i>

40:13.412 --> 40:16.246
<i> And if I don't feel safe,</i>
<i> there is no way</i>

40:16.248 --> 40:19.807
<i> of keeping you safe</i>
<i> when I am sent to save you.</i>

40:19.809 --> 40:22.919
<i> So, effective immediately,</i>

40:22.921 --> 40:26.089
<i> I hereby am resigning</i>
<i> from the AFD.</i>

40:27.000 --> 40:28.741
Nope.
You cannot post that.

40:28.743 --> 40:30.093
I already did.

40:31.096 --> 40:32.762
Marwani, you can't
unring that bell.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.931
I don't wanna unring it, Cap.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.008
For the first time,
I froze up in the field.

40:37.010 --> 40:38.676
Not because I was afraid
of the danger,

40:38.678 --> 40:40.328
but because I was afraid
of doing it wrong.

40:40.330 --> 40:43.331
The people in those tribunals,
in their conference rooms,

40:43.333 --> 40:45.333
they will never understand
what we do here.

40:45.335 --> 40:46.759
So you can't let them
get to you.

40:46.761 --> 40:47.852
MARJAN:
That's the problem.

40:47.854 --> 40:49.279
They've already gotten to me.

40:49.281 --> 40:51.096
Cap, you have to understand,

40:51.098 --> 40:53.098
I would gladly
walk into fire for you,

40:53.100 --> 40:55.434
but I can't do it on eggshells.

40:55.436 --> 40:58.103
Well, obviously you have to do
what you think is right.

40:58.105 --> 41:01.015
But I am so mad
at you right now, Marwani.

41:01.017 --> 41:02.441
I'm sorry you feel that way.

41:02.443 --> 41:04.961
-And I think you're crazy.
-Hey.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.588
But more than anything...

41:08.041 --> 41:09.674
I'm so proud of you.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.638
OWEN:
I understand if you
wanna think about it.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.956
Yeah, it's a work of art,

41:16.958 --> 41:19.217
but it's also
not exactly fuel-efficient

41:19.219 --> 41:21.552
and the, uh, throttle
sticks a little.

41:21.554 --> 41:23.721
I already bought the helmet
and this cool jacket.

41:23.723 --> 41:25.297
It is a sick jacket.

41:25.299 --> 41:27.225
Alright, then,
you better treat her well.

41:27.227 --> 41:28.726
She's very important to me.

41:28.728 --> 41:30.144
I will, Cap.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.363
I was talking to the bike.

41:33.233 --> 41:35.325
Don't make me cry, Cap.

41:37.053 --> 41:39.329
As long as I'm here,
your spot'll be safe.

41:42.501 --> 41:43.725
Captain Vega.

41:43.727 --> 41:44.742
TOMMY: Tommy.

41:44.744 --> 41:46.377
And this isn't goodbye.

41:53.403 --> 41:55.386
All who wander are not lost.

41:56.906 --> 41:58.330
Me and Gracie
will be praying for you.

41:58.332 --> 42:00.074
I'll be praying for you, too.

42:00.076 --> 42:01.267
JUDD: Yeah.

42:02.003 --> 42:03.853
MARJAN: TK.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.855
I promise no matter
what happens,

42:05.857 --> 42:07.248
I will be back for the wedding.

42:07.250 --> 42:10.276
You better, 'cause Carlos
will hunt you down.

42:13.940 --> 42:15.273
Hey, and I want you
to check in every day

42:15.275 --> 42:17.182
about where you're going
and where you're staying.

42:17.184 --> 42:19.035
Would you stop being
such a dad?

42:19.037 --> 42:21.929
But, seriously, you get drowsy,
you pull off the road.

42:21.931 --> 42:24.115
-You understand?
-I will.

42:24.117 --> 42:27.418
(sentimental music playing)

42:35.703 --> 42:36.794
I love you, Marj.

42:36.796 --> 42:38.513
Love you too, buddy.

42:39.949 --> 42:41.432
(Marjan sniffles)

42:43.453 --> 42:46.396
(clears throat) Alright.
(chuckles)

42:46.398 --> 42:47.438
Peace.

42:58.577 --> 42:59.659
(engine roars)

43:02.396 --> 43:05.230
Talk about
riding into the sunset.

43:05.232 --> 43:08.233
Just when I thought
she couldn't be any more badass.

43:08.235 --> 43:09.961
That's Marjan for you.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.424
Maybe I need
to buy another bike.
