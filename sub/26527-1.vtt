16:54.370 --> 16:55.773
You know what?

16:56.873 --> 16:59.274
I don't like
how that guy looks at you.

16:59.276 --> 17:00.742
What?

17:00.744 --> 17:05.244
You think it's any coincidence
the camp counselor picks you?

17:05.247 --> 17:08.517
I am not the one
with the wandering eye, James!

17:08.519 --> 17:11.286
You're the one...
You're the one that went to go...

17:11.288 --> 17:12.388
I gave it a shot!

17:15.826 --> 17:17.060
I tried it.

17:21.464 --> 17:24.268
I am done with this place.

17:28.671 --> 17:30.006
Fine.

17:31.975 --> 17:33.274
Where are you going?

17:33.276 --> 17:35.011
Deal with this.

17:36.613 --> 17:38.281
Perfect.

17:40.216 --> 17:41.451
Perfect.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.908
You did an impressive job
building that campaign,

18:07.910 --> 18:09.578
but you should be
in the city, you know,

18:09.580 --> 18:11.480
where you can be recognized
for your talents.

18:11.482 --> 18:13.917
We'll build something
bigger and better.

18:14.850 --> 18:17.087
Are you listening to me?

18:18.789 --> 18:19.921
Come. Wakey!

18:19.923 --> 18:21.422
- [THUMP]
- Whoa.

18:21.424 --> 18:22.590
What was that?

18:22.592 --> 18:24.559
Did we hit something?

18:24.561 --> 18:27.495
I told you we shouldn't be
coming close to this island.

18:27.497 --> 18:30.632
Submerged rocks everywhere.

18:30.634 --> 18:32.036
Let me look.

18:47.317 --> 18:49.086
Anything?

18:50.454 --> 18:54.591
No.

18:55.591 --> 18:56.924
Okay.

18:56.926 --> 18:59.263
I'll take it slow.

19:14.843 --> 19:17.011
Brad, Becky,

19:17.013 --> 19:19.183
go for Will. Over.

19:34.430 --> 19:35.229
Will?

19:35.231 --> 19:38.199
Hey, Rebecca, come in. Over.

19:38.201 --> 19:40.134
- Will?
- Hey, Mary.

19:40.136 --> 19:41.536
Rebecca, come in. Over.

19:41.538 --> 19:46.308
Hey, Will, um,
James wants to leave.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.710
Yeah, sometimes
on the first day, that happens.

19:48.712 --> 19:51.413
No, no, no. He... He didn't want
to come here in the first place.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.915
This whole thing was my idea.
I think I made a mistake.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.283
Are you listening to me?
I'm trying to tell you that...

19:56.285 --> 19:58.919
- that James and I are leaving.
- Yeah.

19:58.921 --> 20:02.022
I think that you'd do great
at this camp if you commit.

20:02.024 --> 20:04.925
What? No, I-I'm committed.
It's James.

20:04.927 --> 20:06.395
I'm really doing
the best that I can

20:06.397 --> 20:08.229
to make this whole thing work,
but he just...

20:08.231 --> 20:11.468
So you... you walked that arch
all on your own.

20:12.301 --> 20:13.635
- The arch?
- Yeah.

20:13.637 --> 20:15.302
What has that
got to do with anything?

20:15.304 --> 20:16.671
Well, you could have
done this together,

20:16.673 --> 20:19.741
but you decided to come
and do this on your own.

20:19.743 --> 20:21.309
Wait. Are you blaming me?

20:21.311 --> 20:23.845
Yeah, exactly, both of you.

20:23.847 --> 20:25.813
I mean...[LAUGHS] Come on.

20:25.815 --> 20:28.215
This is what
all of this is about,

20:28.217 --> 20:30.251
- radical responsibility...
- Okay, stop right...

20:30.253 --> 20:32.220
for both parties.

20:32.222 --> 20:33.521
I walked that arch by myself,

20:33.523 --> 20:35.991
because I can,
and because I'm right.

20:35.993 --> 20:38.227
So you'd rather be right
than happy?

20:39.896 --> 20:42.195
I would rather
have my money back.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.965
- Ah, okay.
- Yeah.

20:44.967 --> 20:48.304
You're... You're really trying
to piss off a lawyer?

20:50.740 --> 20:51.838
Here we go.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.273
What, you want to go there?

20:53.275 --> 20:55.176
Yeah, let's go there,

20:55.178 --> 20:57.578
and let's start
with false advertising,

20:57.580 --> 21:00.447
'cause this place here is
nowhere near up to the standards

21:00.449 --> 21:02.216
that you set up
in your documentation.

21:02.218 --> 21:05.720
Those pictures on your website,
they're of Hawaii.

21:05.722 --> 21:06.954
Is this place Hawaii?

21:06.956 --> 21:08.822
You knew exactly
where I was taking you.

21:08.824 --> 21:11.826
It's not like I blindfolded you
when I brought you to Ensenada.

21:11.828 --> 21:14.896
Look, we came here
to work with Suzanne Nix, okay,

21:14.898 --> 21:16.431
your wife. Where is she?

21:16.433 --> 21:17.999
She was advertised
in the brochure.

21:18.001 --> 21:19.466
All of us came here for her.

21:19.468 --> 21:21.034
This place is nothing
without her.

21:21.036 --> 21:23.405
No. No, no.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.609
This place
is nothing without you.

21:27.811 --> 21:29.777
I'm in contract law, okay,
so if you think

21:29.779 --> 21:31.979
- I'm just gonna...
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

21:31.981 --> 21:33.213
You... You want to go home?

21:33.215 --> 21:34.982
I'll take you home
tomorrow. Happy?

21:34.984 --> 21:37.786
No. I want to go home now.

21:37.788 --> 21:39.820
Aw, come on, Mary. I've got
other people on this island.

21:39.822 --> 21:42.424
And don't... don't worry about it.
You'll get a full refund.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.225
But just remember,
you came here for a reason.

21:45.227 --> 21:49.132
I want you to think about
that reason before you quit.

21:50.367 --> 21:52.332
Okay?

21:52.334 --> 21:54.138
[CLICKS TONGUE] Okay.

21:55.504 --> 22:00.244
Hey, Brad, Rebecca, you copy?
Over.

22:01.512 --> 22:04.748
Hey, Brad, Rebecca, do you copy?

22:06.049 --> 22:08.185
Brad, do you copy? Over.

22:09.386 --> 22:12.156
Rebecca, go for Will. Over?

22:36.413 --> 22:37.681
So?

22:39.282 --> 22:40.850
We're leaving tomorrow.

22:43.218 --> 22:44.620
It's the best I could do.

22:54.263 --> 22:57.367
Just needed a little more time
with your boyfriend?

23:01.304 --> 23:04.772
Hey, lawyer gymnast,
you gonna get in the water?

23:04.774 --> 23:08.579
Bet you're rockin'
a secret hot bod under there.

23:09.645 --> 23:13.117
You know what, Daphne?
Maybe I will.

23:14.650 --> 23:17.553
Oh! You go, girl!

24:39.101 --> 24:41.669
- Whew.
- Whew.

26:09.592 --> 26:13.161
Sweet Mother Earth,

26:13.163 --> 26:14.861
that was a shark, wasn't it?

26:14.863 --> 26:18.199
This is Baja.
It's great white territory.

26:18.201 --> 26:21.202
W-Wait! Wait!
Who knew about this?!

26:21.204 --> 26:23.507
- Everybody knew that!
- Oh, my God.

26:25.273 --> 26:28.477
Well, don't let that
get in the water. It's chum.

26:31.246 --> 26:33.616
It's okay. I got you.

26:36.019 --> 26:37.020
All right, listen up.

26:38.321 --> 26:39.822
We're gonna get to the boat.

26:42.225 --> 26:44.291
But we gotta swim.

26:44.293 --> 26:46.359
Are you crazy?

26:46.361 --> 26:48.930
There's no way we're getting
back in the water again!

26:48.932 --> 26:51.965
Listen, the tide is too low for
me to bring the boat in here.

26:51.967 --> 26:53.200
There are too many rocks.

26:53.202 --> 26:56.470
I might put a hole in the hull,
and then where are we?

26:56.472 --> 26:58.472
We gotta swim.

26:58.474 --> 26:59.607
I'm with her.

26:59.609 --> 27:00.808
Honey, honey,
honey, honey, honey,

Hey, hey, hey,
we have to do this, baby.

27:03.112 --> 27:04.345
Okay?

27:04.347 --> 27:05.549
Yeah.

27:08.318 --> 27:10.251
What if we wait
for the tide to come in?

27:10.253 --> 27:11.719
Nah, nah. The... The swell...

27:11.721 --> 27:15.359
the platform is way too unstable
for us all to be on it.

27:17.225 --> 27:20.861
I got a plan, but it's
gonna require teamwork.

27:20.863 --> 27:23.630
I am so sick of your teamwork!

27:23.632 --> 27:26.834
The only team you're gonna need
is a team of attorneys!

27:26.836 --> 27:28.868
- No!
- When we get back to the U.S....

27:28.870 --> 27:31.405
- Shut up!
- Look where it's gotten us!

This is the ocean.
It's all shark country.

29:22.718 --> 29:24.417
Then what are we waiting for?

29:24.419 --> 29:25.719
Let's get out of here.

29:25.721 --> 29:28.288
Rebecca is still out there.

29:28.290 --> 29:30.624
So what are the chances
she's not already dead?

29:30.626 --> 29:31.893
Whoa, hey, we don't know that.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.394
So what are you gonna do?

29:33.396 --> 29:34.962
We're gonna find her,

29:34.964 --> 29:37.164
and we're gonna kill that shark.

29:38.935 --> 29:41.735
- Yeah.
- Give me a shell.

29:41.737 --> 29:43.803
I'm gonna make a bang stick,

29:43.805 --> 29:45.371
jab it into the shark's head,

29:45.373 --> 29:46.807
and blow its brains out.

without Rebecca.

31:57.473 --> 31:59.440
Yeah, we can, and we will.

I've ever seen in my life.

There.

something about the weather.

50:13.668 --> 50:16.501

You should see it. Come on.

51:19.132 --> 51:21.270
That shark was born here.

You see those bays outside?

That's where they birthed them.

See? I told you.

51:27.975 --> 51:30.442
This is
the monster's birthplace.

51:30.444 --> 51:32.513
But why?

51:33.781 --> 51:35.480
Because sharks
have an amazing ability

51:35.482 --> 51:38.351
to repair themselves,
regenerate, really.

51:38.353 --> 51:40.186
Seems like they were taking
some of that ability

51:40.188 --> 51:42.054
of the shark to regenerate

51:42.056 --> 51:45.724
and trying to impart it
into humans.

51:45.726 --> 51:49.628

to live for 400-plus years.

51:49.630 --> 51:51.463
Look here.

51:51.465 --> 51:53.965
If you damage
this thing badly enough,

51:53.967 --> 51:57.103
but you don't kill it,
it regenerates,

51:57.105 --> 51:59.438
but instead
of just repairing itself...

51:59.440 --> 52:02.641
It grows a new head.

52:02.643 --> 52:04.376
Exactly.

52:04.378 --> 52:08.346
And this thing has been
injured five times severely.

52:08.348 --> 52:10.315
That means
what we're dealing with

52:10.317 --> 52:13.585
is six interdependent
great white sharks.

52:13.587 --> 52:18.190
That grow its heads back
every time you chop it off.

52:18.192 --> 52:19.458
So how do we kill it?

52:19.460 --> 52:23.061
We have to go
for the heart space.

Captain Science over there?

52:30.839 --> 52:33.271
He said it regenerates.

52:33.273 --> 52:36.608

its heart?

Where did you find
the acetylene canisters?

01:12:42.749 --> 01:12:45.252
I need to lure the shark
out of the water.

What's the point?

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.770
I relish the idea
of spending time in prison.

01:13:39.772 --> 01:13:42.073
That's not gonna happen.
I'll represent you,

01:13:42.075 --> 01:13:43.640
but you might lose
everything else.

01:13:43.642 --> 01:13:46.411
I've already lost everything.

01:13:46.413 --> 01:13:48.781

with that, too.

on who to attack.

Wait for the shark
to be over the canisters!

01:14:34.328 --> 01:14:36.230
Don't shoot yet!
