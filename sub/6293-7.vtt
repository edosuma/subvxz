A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST WANT

02:08.729 --> 02:11.131
TO BE RESCUED FROM THEMSELVES.

02:15.769 --> 02:18.906
THEY WISH THEY COULD BE
AIRLIFTED FROM THEIR SKIN

02:18.939 --> 02:20.508

JUST WISH I COULD STAY
THE SAME FOR A WHOLE WEEK.

02:36.824 --> 02:41.595
BUT THEN IRONICALLY
I'D BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT PERSON.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.525
SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.360
THANK YOU.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.431
I'M SORRY TO JUST SHOW UP
LIKE THIS,

03:17.465 --> 03:19.367
BUT THINGS ARE GETTING
VERY HAIRY AT HOME.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.401
YOU WOULDN'T RETURN MY CALLS

03:20.434 --> 03:22.336
AND I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.505
MAX, AS YOUR WIFE'S THERAPIST,

03:24.538 --> 03:25.973
THERE ARE BOUNDARIES
I HAVE TO OBSERVE.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.908
I CAN'T ADVISE YOU.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.410
NOW IF TARA WANTS
TO COME IN--

03:29.443 --> 03:30.578
PLEASE, I--I--

03:30.611 --> 03:32.980
I THINK I SAW SOMETHING.
A NEW ALTER.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.820
COMPLETELY NEW PERSONALITY?

03:39.853 --> 03:42.756
TARA'S PARENTS
WERE VISITING US LAST WEEK

03:42.790 --> 03:44.292
AND IT WAS A...

03:44.325 --> 03:45.726
WORLD OF SHIT AS USUAL.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.361
WHATEVER.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.964
AND I SAW SOMETHING,
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.433
IT WASN'T TARA.

03:52.466 --> 03:53.801
WAS LIKE THIS--

03:53.834 --> 03:55.436
WHAT WAS IT?

03:55.469 --> 03:57.738
IT'S LIKE A WEIRD PONCHO
GOBLIN OR SOMETHING.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.541
PONCHO GOBLIN.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.742
IT WASN'T HER.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.011
IT'S LIKE AN ANIMAL.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.313
IT DID STUFF
AN ANIMAL WOULD DO.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.783
MAX, I'VE--

04:09.817 --> 04:12.886
I'VE REALLY BEEN EDUCATING
MYSELF ABOUT THIS STUFF LATELY.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.888
LATELY?

04:14.922 --> 04:17.558
I--I SHOULDN'T BE SPEAKING
TO YOU AT ALL ABOUT...

04:20.060 --> 04:21.462
IT'S VERY COMMON
FOR THERE TO BE

04:21.495 --> 04:23.997
A CHILD-LIKE
OR NOCTURNAL ALTER.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.800
I THINK THIS BEING
HAS MANIFESTED ITSELF

04:26.834 --> 04:29.737
BECAUSE OF TARA'S LIFETIME
OF SECRETS.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.939
SHE'S LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
ABOUT HER YOUTH.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.743
MAYBE WHIMSICAL NIGHTTIME PLAY

04:35.776 --> 04:37.311
HELPS HER DISCOVER
THOSE ANSWERS.

THIS WASN'T WHIMSICAL.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.381

04:48.989 --> 04:50.591
YOU COME WITH HER

04:50.624 --> 04:52.993

ABOUT THE MEMORIES

ALL THIS.

[sighs]

04:56.597 --> 04:57.598
YOU THINK THAT'LL WORK?

04:57.631 --> 05:01.068
I THINK HAVING A PROFESSIONAL

05:01.101 --> 05:02.903
AND A LOVED ONE WORKING
IN TANDEM

05:02.936 --> 05:04.071
CAN BE VERY PRODUCTIVE.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.774
OKAY.

I TRUST YOU.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.012

AND--OH, HEY.

DID YOU REMEMBER TO GET

05:32.032 --> 05:33.401

ALL THE VANILLA ONES.

TO BE JUDGED.

13:59.006 --> 14:02.175
SITTING ON MY CHEST

14:03.576 --> 14:04.878
OKAY, JUST STOP.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.247

14:07.280 --> 14:09.449
YOU'RE LUCKY I'M HERE.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.084
I WAS MEANT TO GO

14:16.489 --> 14:17.925
YOU DON'T SEE ME BITCHIN'.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.659
TARA, YOU DIDN'T GO
TO VIETNAM.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.462
YOU'RE A 35-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.365
YOU'VE GOT TWO KIDS.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.468
YOU LOST YOUR TONSILS IN '76
AND THAT'S IT.

14:28.501 --> 14:32.105
"OXYCODONE."

14:32.139 --> 14:35.342
THIS IS HILLBILLY HEROIN.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.477
IT'S FOR PAIN.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.947

14:46.586 --> 14:49.189
AND, UM, IT'S--

14:49.222 --> 14:50.423
I MEAN,
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

14:50.457 --> 14:54.361
I JUST HAVE THIS FEELING
THAT, UM,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.563
SOMETHING...

14:56.596 --> 14:59.232
HAPPENED TO TARA
WHEN YOU TWO WENT TO SCHOOL.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.102
ARE YOU, LIKE--ARE YOU--

15:02.135 --> 15:03.603
ARE YOU DIVORCING HER
OR SOMETHING?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.172
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET DIRT.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.273
IS THIS A CUSTODY THING?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.274
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.275
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.376
NOT A CUSTODY THING.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.145
UM, I--

15:12.179 --> 15:14.181
IT'S A LONG STORY
AND IT'S COMPLICATED,

15:14.214 --> 15:17.017
BUT I'M--I'M JUST DOING THIS
BECAUSE I LOVE HER.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.956
TARA AND I HAD A FALLING OUT

15:22.990 --> 15:24.424
DURING OUR SECOND YEAR
OF SCHOOL.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.227
ANYWAY, I FINALLY--
I GET A BOYFRIEND.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.228
HE'S MY FIRST ONE.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.030
AND HIS NAME IS TRIP.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.698
AND HE'S--
HE'S VERY OUTDOORSY.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.500
HE'S REALLY INTO WINDSURFING.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.368
HE'S VERY WEATHERED AND,
YOU KNOW, KIND OF MELANOMA SEXY.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.137
RIGHT, OKAY.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.271
RIGHT.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.406
SO ONE MORNING, UH,

15:39.439 --> 15:40.740
TARA COMES BACK
TO THE ROOM

15:40.773 --> 15:42.142
AND SHE'S ALL MESSED UP.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.543
MESSED UP HOW?

15:43.576 --> 15:45.045
SHE LOOKED LIKE SHE HAD BEEN
KNOCKED AROUND.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.513
AND I ASKED HER WHAT HAPPENED

15:46.546 --> 15:47.514
AND SHE SAID THAT
SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.316
I DIDN'T--ALSO--

15:49.349 --> 15:51.484
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T ASK HER
ONLY REALLY ASK HER

15:51.518 --> 15:53.453
'CAUSE THAT KIND OF SHIT
HAPPENED

15:53.486 --> 15:55.755
AT ST. ANN'S ALL THE TIME.
IT WAS THE LATE '80S.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.058
YOU KNOW, MOSH PITS
AND EVERYTHING.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.460
YEAH, BUT THE NIGHT
THAT SHE WAS ATTACKED.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.062
SO THEN I FIND OUT

16:02.095 --> 16:03.430
FROM SOME GIRLS AROUND SCHOOL

16:03.463 --> 16:05.598
THAT SHE HAD SLEPT
WITH TRIP THAT NIGHT.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.766
YOUR TRIP?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.268
YEAH.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.736
AND I WAS PISSED.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.305
AND THEN I CONFRONTED HIM
AND HE DENIED IT.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.506
AND...

16:13.540 --> 16:15.342
AND TARA AND I NEVER SPOKE
AGAIN.

16:15.375 --> 16:18.478
AND I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

16:18.511 --> 16:19.779
BUT I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
OVER THE YEARS

16:19.812 --> 16:21.114
AND I JUST--
I THINK IT'S FISHY.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.782
YEAH, IT'S VERY FISHY.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.052
I THINK HE LIED AND I THINK
HE DID DO SOMETHING TO HER.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.522
UH, WHAT'S TRIP'S LAST NAME?

16:29.556 --> 16:30.790
CAN I HAVE HIS LAST NAME?

16:30.823 --> 16:35.628
YOU HAVE A PEN OR...

16:35.662 --> 16:38.265
HIS NAME IS TRIP JOHANSEN

16:38.298 --> 16:40.067
[on TV]
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!

16:40.100 --> 16:44.704
AND A LEFT KICK
TO THE BODY.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.506
I PEEKED UNDER THE BANDAGES.

16:46.539 --> 16:49.376
SEE ANYTHING YOU LIKE?

16:49.409 --> 16:53.246
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE NICE.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.283
ONCE THE WEEPING STOPS.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.517
YOU'RE A NICE-LOOKIN' WOMAN.

16:57.550 --> 17:03.290
I BET THAT COMMIE DOCTOR
FIXED YOU UP GOOD.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.457
COULD THAT GO OFF?

17:04.491 --> 17:06.793
DEPENDS HOW MUCH MORE
YOU TALK.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.461
HA HA.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.132
IF I TALK ABOUT THE KIDS,

17:12.165 --> 17:13.533
WILL THAT CHANGE YOU BACK?

17:13.566 --> 17:15.668
BACK TO WHAT?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.338
I HEAR MARSHALL HAS A CRUSH
ON A BOY AT SCHOOL.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.108
PROBABLY ANOTHER CREAMPUFF.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.542
THEY'RE RUNNIN' RAMPANT
THESE DAYS.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.212
HOW CAN YOU TALK THAT WAY
ABOUT YOUR SON?

17:25.245 --> 17:28.281
MARSHALL AIN'T MY SON,
THANK GOD.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.550
IF I HAD A SON,
HE'D BE A GRADE-A PUSSY HOUND.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.252
YOU GOT HIM!

17:32.285 --> 17:34.154
TAKE THE FUCKER DOWN!

17:34.187 --> 17:35.655
AH, SHIT.

17:35.688 --> 17:39.292
MAYBE HE'S JUST STRUGGLING
WITH HIS IDENTITY.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.828
I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO I AM.

17:41.861 --> 17:45.565
I FUCKING GOT FIRED
FROM VITA-SELF.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.467
SURE GOT FUCKED OVER

17:47.500 --> 17:49.202
WITH THAT WHOLE
RESTRAINING ORDER THING.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.503
RIGHT?

17:50.537 --> 17:51.771
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO DEFACED

17:51.804 --> 17:54.107
THAT RIDICULOUS MURAL.

17:54.141 --> 17:57.644
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY TARA DID.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.379

18:11.158 --> 18:13.693

18:16.929 --> 18:18.765
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.268
THAT LADY'S GOT PROBLEMS.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.503
THE REST OF US JUST GOTTA
HOLD IT DOWN

18:23.536 --> 18:27.440
AS LONG AS WE CAN.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.410
I REALLY HATE HER.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.545
SOMETIMES.

18:32.579 --> 18:33.546
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.547
[blows]

18:34.581 --> 18:36.283
ALWAYS FIGHTIN'.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.918
MUST BE BECAUSE
OF YOUR MONTHLY BILL.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.920
IT'S A SISTER THING.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.189
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.190
[blows]

18:43.223 --> 18:44.457
I MEAN, MY WHOLE LIFE

18:44.491 --> 18:46.426
TARA'S BEEN MORE LOVED
BY EVERYONE.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.696
I MEAN,
OUR PARENTS OBVIOUSLY.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.732
SHE ALWAYS ATTRACTS
GOOD GUYS.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.601
THEY WEREN'T ALL GOOD.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.470
MAX IS GREAT.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.672
I'VE NEVER BEEN WITH
ANYONE GREAT.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.742
JUST GUYS WHO WORK IN BARS

19:02.775 --> 19:04.344
AND HAVE HUGE GROSS ARMS.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.214
GUYS WHOSE NAMES

19:07.247 --> 19:08.348

TO THE GUN RANGE SOME TIME?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.439
SURE.

20:06.473 --> 20:08.341
JUST GOTTA WATCH OUT
FOR THE KICK BACK.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.810
DON'T WANT TO BUST A TITTY.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.679
I THINK I'D LOOK GOOD
WITH A GUN.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.414
MOST WOMEN DO.

20:14.447 --> 20:19.419
OH, BE SURE AND CONDITION
THE ENDS.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.354
YOU KNOW, TARA USED TO WASH
MY HAIR

20:21.388 --> 20:23.256
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.991
[laughs]

20:25.024 --> 20:27.927
ONE TIME WE WERE PLAYING
BEAUTY SALON

20:27.960 --> 20:29.329
OUTSIDE WITH THE HOSE

20:29.362 --> 20:31.564
AND WE GOT IN TROUBLE

20:31.598 --> 20:35.302
BECAUSE THE SHAMPOO KILLED
MOM'S GERANIUMS.

20:35.335 --> 20:39.339
AND--

20:39.372 --> 20:42.275
BUCK?

20:42.309 --> 20:44.544
CHARMAINE?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.613
YOU--OH, GOD.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.281
I'M SO SORRY.

20:48.315 --> 20:51.551
OH, TARA, YOU'RE BACK.

20:51.584 --> 20:52.785
[coughing]
YEAH.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.588
[retching]

20:55.622 --> 20:57.324
I'M SORRY.
CIGARETTES MAKE ME SICK.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.425
IT'S OKAY.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.592
IT'S OKAY.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

20:59.626 --> 21:02.295
[coughs]

21:02.329 --> 21:03.530
[spits]

21:07.567 --> 21:09.035
WHO DROVE YOU HOME?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.470
BUCK DID.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.739
OH, NO.
WAS HE HORRIBLE?

21:12.772 --> 21:16.709
NO.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.011
HE WAS A PRETTY GOOD
BOOBY BUDDY.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.321
[jazz music playing]

21:28.355 --> 21:35.027
*

21:35.061 --> 21:40.867
[phone buzzes]

21:40.900 --> 21:43.403
HELLO.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.937
OH, HEY.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.583
[sighs]

21:56.616 --> 21:59.018
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
HEALTHY IN THIS BAG.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.687
GOOD.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.054
I NEED LOTS OF BAD CARBS

22:02.088 --> 22:04.891
TO SOAK UP ALL THIS
PRESCRIPTION DOPE.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.759
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

22:06.793 --> 22:09.829
MM, LIKE SOMEONE SHOVED
SALTWATER BAGS

22:09.862 --> 22:13.566
UNDER MY PEC MUSCLES.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.735
BUT MY HAIR LOOKS AMAZING.

22:15.768 --> 22:16.836
[laughs]

22:16.869 --> 22:18.438
BUCK SHOULD OPEN A SALON.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.374
YEAH, HE COULD CALL IT
HAIR TRIGGER.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.375
FUNNY.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.376
[laughs]

22:23.410 --> 22:24.711
NOT REALLY.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.446
SO WAIT, WHAT'S THE STORY
WITH JASON?

22:26.479 --> 22:27.714
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

22:27.747 --> 22:29.549
SHH! HE GOES TO SCHOOL HERE,
YOU KNOW?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.951
ALONG WITH 4,000
OTHER ASSHOLES

22:31.984 --> 22:33.886
WHO HAPPEN TO LIVE
IN THE DISTRICT.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.988
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.957
PRETTY MUCH BLEW HIM OFF
AT SETS.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.125
LIKE YOU SAID.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.460
I WAS BOTH COLD
AND ALOOF.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.828
AND HOW'D THAT WORK OUT?

22:41.861 --> 22:45.398
HE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.933
NO SHIT!

22:46.966 --> 22:48.601
YEAH, HE HAD--

22:48.635 --> 22:50.136
HE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT
MCCABE AND MRS. MILLER.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.871
BUT I THINK HE WAS LYING
BECAUSE, I MEAN,

22:51.904 --> 22:53.840
SINCE WHEN DOES HE EVEN CARE
ABOUT ALTMAN ANYWAY?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.141
HE DOESN'T.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.609
I WAS RIGHT.

22:56.643 --> 22:57.644
YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.011
JUST FEELS SO PHONY.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.980
I MEAN, WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE
TO HIDE THEIR FEELINGS

23:01.013 --> 23:01.981
TO SEEM MORE ATTRACTIVE?

23:02.014 --> 23:04.551
BECAUSE PEOPLE ONLY CHASE

23:04.584 --> 23:06.419
WHATEVER IT IS THAT
THEY CAN'T HAVE.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.720
IT'S BASIC BOY SCIENCE.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.989
THERE'S ACTUALLY
THIS OLD BOOK ON IT

23:10.022 --> 23:11.824
CALLED THE RULES.

23:11.858 --> 23:12.992
AUNT CHARMAINE HAS IT
ON HER TOILET.

23:13.025 --> 23:14.594
[bell rings]

23:14.627 --> 23:16.596
SO I BASICALLY JUST HAVE
TO KEEP PRETENDING

23:16.629 --> 23:17.964
THAT I DON'T LIKE HIM?

23:17.997 --> 23:19.732
I MEAN, YOU COULD EVEN ACT

23:19.766 --> 23:20.967
LIKE YOU ACTIVELY DISLIKE HIM

23:21.000 --> 23:24.036
AND THAT'D PROBABLY WORK OKAY.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.204
I DON'T GET IT.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.006
IT'S ALL ABOUT MATURITY,
MOOSH.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.642
LIKE, YOU KNOW THAT STUFF
THEY TEACH YOU IN KINDERGARTEN

23:29.676 --> 23:31.110
ABOUT BEING YOURSELF?

23:31.143 --> 23:32.579
IT'S BULLSHIT.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.880
DON'T EVER BE YOURSELF.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.748
IT'S THE KISS OF DEATH.

23:41.888 --> 23:42.822
[door shuts]

23:46.859 --> 23:48.060
YOU'RE BACK!

23:48.094 --> 23:49.729
I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF HER
ALL DAY.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.730
DIDN'T EVEN GET TO SHOWER.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.132
YOU ARE A GREAT BREAST FRIEND.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.901
BOOBY BUDDY.

23:54.934 --> 23:55.935
[grumbles]

23:55.968 --> 23:57.870
[sniffs]

23:57.904 --> 24:00.740
MM, I SMELL GUN OIL
AND LUCKY STRIKES.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.842
MM, GUESS WHY.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.014
HI, MOMMY.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.849
HI, SWEETHEART.

24:09.882 --> 24:11.684
WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT?

24:11.718 --> 24:13.720
OH, I FORGOT TO BRING
A CHANGE OF CLOTHES

24:13.753 --> 24:15.555
AND HAD TO BORROW SOMETHING
FROM CHARMAINE.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.525
WHERE DOES SHE SHOP,
FOREVER 36?

24:18.558 --> 24:19.792
[laughs]

24:19.826 --> 24:21.828
SO WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO
LAST NIGHT?

24:21.861 --> 24:22.895
HAD THIS PLACE TO YOURSELVES.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.030
KIND OF FUN, RIGHT?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.498
OH, I WENT OUT
WITH THE GIRLS.

24:25.532 --> 24:26.833
WE SAW THIS MOVIE.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.134
IT WAS THE DUMBEST MOVIE
OF ALL TIME, MOM.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.569
IT IS SO STUPID.

24:29.602 --> 24:30.770
I CANNOT WAIT
TO GO SEE IT AGAIN

24:30.803 --> 24:32.572
SO I CAN HATE IT EVEN MORE.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.140
I WORKED ON SETS
AT THE HELL HOUSE.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.909
WE'RE COMING REALLY CLOSE
TO A REALISTIC UNDERWORLD LOOK.

24:36.943 --> 24:38.077
PLUS I CREATED
THIS FAUX FINISH

24:38.110 --> 24:39.779
THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
SCABBED FLESH.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.247
EW, COOL.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.715
HUH.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

24:42.749 --> 24:46.085
I, UH, HIT THE GYM WITH NEIL

24:46.118 --> 24:47.987
AND WE HAD A COUPLE BEERS.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.923
SOUNDS NICE
AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

24:50.957 --> 24:52.124
HOW'S CHARMANIAC?

24:52.158 --> 24:54.026
MM, SHE'S GREAT.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.294
HER SWELLING'S ALREADY
GOING DOWN.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.996
AND I THINK WHEN SHE HEALS,

24:57.029 --> 24:59.265
THEY'RE BOTH GONNA POINT
IN THE SAME DIRECTION.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.767
UGH, MOM, CAN WE PLEASE
NOT TALK

25:00.800 --> 25:02.569
ABOUT CHARMAINE'S BODY?

25:02.602 --> 25:03.836
SORRY.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.137
(Max)
WELL, WE MISSED YOU.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.007
WANNA TRY SOME OF MARSHALL'S
SKIRT STEAK

25:08.040 --> 25:10.176
WITH TRUFFLE SALT, RIGHT?

25:10.209 --> 25:11.744
SOME MUSHROOMS HE'S NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.780
I WOULD LOVE NOTHING MORE.

25:13.813 --> 25:14.781
JUST GONNA TAKE A SHOWER.

25:14.814 --> 25:16.148
BACK IN A MINUTE.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.850
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU SMELL
LIKE SMOKE.

25:19.852 --> 25:20.820
SO DO YOU.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.290
HMM, BUSTED.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.094
(Tara)
CHANGE CAN BE GOOD
FOR THE SOUL,

25:28.127 --> 25:31.798
I GUESS.

25:31.831 --> 25:35.067
SOMETIMES IT'S LONG OVERDUE.

25:35.101 --> 25:38.938
AW.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.106
BOOSH.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.641
IN MY CASE,

25:41.674 --> 25:43.009
[scoffs]

25:43.042 --> 25:45.612
IT'S JUST A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

25:50.349 --> 25:53.119
I'VE NEVER LIED TO THE KIDS
ABOUT A TRANSITION BEFORE.

25:53.152 --> 25:56.623
I JUST...

25:56.656 --> 25:59.358
DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM
THROUGH ANY STRESS RIGHT NOW.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.661
I TOLD MAX THOUGH.

26:01.694 --> 26:05.632
I KNOW HE'D NEVER KEEP ANYTHING
FROM ME.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.138
[camera beeps off]

26:26.385 --> 26:28.020
HEY.
HEY.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.060
[clears throat]

26:37.129 --> 26:39.165
I FEEL TIRED ALL THE TIME.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.333
I EVEN WAKE UP FEELING
WORN OUT.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.703
YOU BEEN HAVING STRANGE DREAMS?

26:43.736 --> 26:44.971
NO.

26:45.004 --> 26:45.972
WHY?
AM I TALKING IN MY SLEEP?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.977
HMM, NOT TALKING.

26:51.010 --> 26:51.944
HMM.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.385
DID YOU JUST SCOOT AWAY
FROM ME?

26:59.418 --> 27:01.087
NO.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.755
WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:02.789 --> 27:04.190
NOTHING.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.328
I LOVE YOU.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.935
