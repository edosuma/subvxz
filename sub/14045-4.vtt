WEBVTT

00:03.184 --> 00:04.894
- Ah.
- Hello.

00:04.926 --> 00:06.942
- How are you?
- All right.

00:06.973 --> 00:09.822
- I got you something.
- Ah, the key to your heart.

00:09.853 --> 00:12.446
- To my apartment.
- Ah, big spender.

00:12.477 --> 00:14.398
What'd it cost you... a whole dollar?

00:14.399 --> 00:17.918
A buck 50 with tax. But,
hey, you're worth it.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.585
Nice. See now I don't have to use
the one that's under the flower pot.

00:20.586 --> 00:24.829
That is the one under the
flower pot. But it's yours now.

00:27.006 --> 00:29.942
42-year-old male, full arrest
status post electrocution!

00:29.942 --> 00:31.782
- PEA from the get-go.
- Okay, okay. Trauma 2, come on.

00:31.806 --> 00:33.969
Guy's a janitor working in
an office building at night.

00:33.970 --> 00:35.526
Had his wife and kids with him on the shift

00:35.550 --> 00:37.420
when he plugged in a
floor-polishing machine,

00:37.421 --> 00:39.530
- and wham! He got zapped pretty good.
- That's okay. Prep an intubation

00:39.531 --> 00:42.526
tray with a MAC 4. I need an
antecubital ASAP. One, two, three.

00:44.286 --> 00:45.949
Thank you.

00:45.950 --> 00:47.613
I got snakes in my throat!

00:47.614 --> 00:49.711
- Yes! It's OK. Talk to me.
- I've been here 12 times,

00:49.717 --> 00:52.478
- and no one will treat me!
- That's not true.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.958
What's the problem, Sir?
What's... what's going on?

00:53.982 --> 00:56.636
- See them writhing?! See them?!
- No. I-I don't see anything at all.

00:56.637 --> 00:58.150
- Just calm down. Hey, hey, hey.
- I-I... get them out of me!

00:58.174 --> 00:59.590
Open your mouth. Let me take a look.

00:59.614 --> 01:00.606
- Open up, Sir.
- I don't see anything, man.

01:00.607 --> 01:02.366
- Okay. Oh, yeah.
- Ahh!

01:02.397 --> 01:04.958
- I see a copper head and a baby garter.
- What?

01:04.989 --> 01:07.262
Okay, look. We have to do
a-an immediate snake removal.

01:07.299 --> 01:09.191
I need Brevital, ringed forceps.

01:09.192 --> 01:11.070
Sir, you just relax. All right?

01:11.102 --> 01:12.190
Relax, okay?

01:12.222 --> 01:13.599
Brevital, 10 milligrams per milliliter.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.965
Okay Sir.

01:15.966 --> 01:19.358
Okay. All right. Settle down.

01:19.390 --> 01:22.173
All right, look. We got
about 20 seconds to do this.

01:22.174 --> 01:23.389
- Let's go.
- Sure.

01:23.390 --> 01:25.246
Yeah, w-what exactly are we doing here?

01:25.278 --> 01:27.100
This man thinks that he
has snakes in his throat.

01:27.101 --> 01:30.462
If he thinks that he's been
treated, he won't come back.

01:30.493 --> 01:32.702
Seen this a million times.
Let's go. Get it on him...

01:35.437 --> 01:38.220
We have a couple of base jumpers
at the Tower of the Americas.

01:38.221 --> 01:39.668
One parachute opened, the other one...

01:39.669 --> 01:40.470
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

01:40.471 --> 01:43.347
Did not exactly stick his landing. Tee,
Gwen's already out there. I need you to...

01:43.348 --> 01:44.469
- All right, I'm on it.
- Grab Chavez, he's free.

01:44.469 --> 01:46.009
He's been bugging me to
get out when surgery's slow.

01:46.010 --> 01:47.101
Okay. Will do.

01:48.542 --> 01:52.413
All right. Muscle aches, chills, nausea...

01:52.414 --> 01:54.046
Not a good night, huh?

01:54.078 --> 01:55.870
- I made her come in.
- For nothing.

01:55.901 --> 02:00.445
Seriously. I have an epic hangover
and maybe a touch of the flu.

02:00.446 --> 02:02.495
It was really nice of
you to drive me down here,

02:02.496 --> 02:04.540
but you totally didn't have to.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.686
How do think I got "RA of the Year"?

02:06.717 --> 02:07.717
Regents Hall!

02:07.742 --> 02:10.767
Um, she has a fever of
103. Heart rate is 120.

02:10.768 --> 02:13.118
Okay, that sounds like
more than a hangover,

02:13.124 --> 02:14.774
so we're gonna need to run some tests.

02:14.775 --> 02:18.206
No. No, no, no. The only test
I have is a major chem exam,

02:18.207 --> 02:20.350
which I-I haven't even studied for, so...

02:20.568 --> 02:22.272
Let's go.

02:22.279 --> 02:26.589
I can come back in if I need
to, but... I'll be fine. Really.

02:26.590 --> 02:27.677
Lorelei!

02:27.678 --> 02:29.341
Paul, get the Ambu-bag.

02:29.342 --> 02:31.133
He's V-fib!

02:31.134 --> 02:33.219
Paddles to Dr Alister, please.

02:33.566 --> 02:35.965
Clear.

02:38.014 --> 02:40.029
Still V-fib. Charge again.

02:40.030 --> 02:42.235
Charge to 200.

02:43.294 --> 02:46.173
Clear!

02:46.174 --> 02:47.678
Come on, come on, come on.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.461
Clear!

02:50.462 --> 02:54.654
Strong carotid. Welcome back, Sir!

02:54.686 --> 02:57.470
Michael, can you
go speak to the family?

03:02.782 --> 03:05.342
- Maria Hinojosa?
- SÃ­ Doctor!

03:05.374 --> 03:07.165
No, no. I'm not the, uh...

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.222 --> 03:19.636
- I speak English.
- Good.

03:19.637 --> 03:21.182
So do I. So you can talk to us.

03:21.214 --> 03:22.972
- We can translate.
- Well, all right.

03:22.973 --> 03:24.446
So you work with your parents?

03:24.477 --> 03:26.430
Did you work with your parents, too?

03:26.461 --> 03:28.350
We clean offices with them at night.

03:28.381 --> 03:30.749
Yeah. Yeah, sort of. I-I, um...

03:30.782 --> 03:35.133
I used to work with my dad and... Um...

03:35.134 --> 03:38.461
You know what? I've got an
idea. Why don't you come with me.

03:42.137 --> 03:44.444
Bumper pool! Can we play?

03:44.445 --> 03:46.205
Of course. That's what it's there for.

03:46.238 --> 03:48.406
Aw! I want to be a doctor when I grow up.

03:48.407 --> 03:50.782
Mm. Me too.

03:50.813 --> 03:51.709
Gracias.

03:51.742 --> 03:54.270
Hey, right here.

03:56.015 --> 03:57.973
Yeah, ah-ha-ha. Right here. Good.

03:58.622 --> 03:59.805
What do you got?

03:59.838 --> 04:01.565
Case of the malfunctioning parachute.

04:01.598 --> 04:03.548
From the looks of it, he may
have a spinal-cord injury.

04:03.549 --> 04:04.765
I didn't want to move him
until you guys got here.

04:04.766 --> 04:05.694
- Vitals?
- I'm not sure...

04:05.726 --> 04:06.864
I haven't gotten to him yet.

04:06.865 --> 04:08.606
- I can see why.
- That's not him.

04:08.637 --> 04:10.078
Over here.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.238
That's him.

04:14.270 --> 04:15.847
Okay... Whoa.

04:18.845 --> 04:21.063
- Does he have a pulse?
- Barely

04:21.411 --> 04:23.568
I'm getting this chute off.

04:23.826 --> 04:25.468
How does he look?

04:25.469 --> 04:27.645
Worst landing ever.

04:46.992 --> 04:50.782
Parachuting can bang you up pretty
bad, even when you do it right.

04:50.788 --> 04:52.578
I still feel some of my jumps.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.960
I didn't do as many jumps
as you did with the PJs,

04:54.992 --> 04:56.457
but my ankles are still wonky.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.798
All right. One, two, three!

04:58.799 --> 05:00.253
That why you do all that yoga crap?

05:00.254 --> 05:03.006
- Therapy?
- Yeah. You could say that.

05:03.038 --> 05:04.896
You know, I was gonna do
some base jumping myself,

05:04.920 --> 05:06.461
then I made the mistake of telling Jordan.

05:06.462 --> 05:08.838
That's what I like about being
single. I get to do whatever I want.

05:08.862 --> 05:11.709
All right. He's ready to transport.

05:13.342 --> 05:15.358
Easy, easy.

05:17.950 --> 05:19.582
Hello.

05:19.614 --> 05:21.748
Hey, Lorelei. How you feeling?

05:21.777 --> 05:24.722
Pretty good, considering I took
a header to the floor earlier.

05:24.753 --> 05:25.978
She has an elevated white count,

05:26.002 --> 05:28.369
- but her UA and lytes are normal.
- Ouch.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.682
Okay. And tender here, too?

05:29.713 --> 05:30.642
Mm. Double ouch.

05:30.673 --> 05:32.306
Please stop. It's making me nauseous.

05:32.337 --> 05:34.866
I'm concerned that you have
a gynecologic infection,

05:34.872 --> 05:37.020
so Dr Cummings is gonna do a pelvic exam

05:37.021 --> 05:38.800
so we can find the source.

05:38.801 --> 05:41.098
Please tell me your name is Dr Cummings

05:41.099 --> 05:43.316
and that you like to refer to
yourself in the third person.

05:43.316 --> 05:45.586
I am not, but you'll be fine.

05:45.617 --> 05:47.871
And I will check in on you later, okay?

05:50.929 --> 05:54.167
Okay... Um... Nurse?

05:54.322 --> 05:57.948
Let's get a CT, a chemistry, and a total CK
to make sure he doesn't go into rhabdo...

05:57.949 --> 05:59.393
and have Ragosa tell the
family, we're taking him

05:59.394 --> 06:00.430
- for tests.
- All over it.

06:00.431 --> 06:02.449
Hey, buddy. I'm cured now.

06:02.482 --> 06:03.760
No thanks to you.

06:07.406 --> 06:08.245
Yo, Toph.

06:08.256 --> 06:10.865
Uh, TC and Dr Chavez are headed back.

06:10.866 --> 06:12.490
Got a possible spinal fracture.

06:12.490 --> 06:14.504
Jump off a building, what do you expect?

06:14.504 --> 06:15.410
Mm-hmm.

06:15.411 --> 06:18.454
So, uh, what... what do
you make of this Chavez cat?

06:18.455 --> 06:19.602
Great surgeon.

06:19.633 --> 06:22.030
- You know, he's... he's grown on me.
- No, no, no.

06:22.031 --> 06:24.572
I... I mean... I mean the
constant downward doggin',

06:24.572 --> 06:26.001
the-the-the Kumbaya vibe.

06:26.034 --> 06:28.786
Hey, I don't know, man.
He rubs me the wrong way.

06:28.817 --> 06:31.625
Think he might be down doggin' Krista?

06:31.626 --> 06:33.181
No way, man. He's not her type.

06:33.182 --> 06:36.513
What? Good-looking, ex-military
surgeon who makes bank?

06:36.514 --> 06:37.766
I'm pretty sure he's every girl's type.

06:37.767 --> 06:39.247
Trust me... they're not doing it.

06:39.248 --> 06:41.710
I don't know. People like to hide
these things in the workplace.

06:41.711 --> 06:42.546
Topher!

06:42.577 --> 06:44.396
The electrocuted man's
wife is in the break room,

06:44.397 --> 06:46.130
and she wants to speak to a doctor.

06:46.161 --> 06:48.562
Okay, I'll get Ragosa in there
to explain everything to them.

06:52.004 --> 06:53.329
All right, rigid abdomen.

06:53.362 --> 06:55.081
We're gonna have to get an ultrasound
when we get to the hospital.

06:55.088 --> 06:56.912
BP... 90 over 60. Pulse... 130.

06:56.913 --> 06:58.242
Second liter wide open.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.477
All right, when we get to the hospital,

06:59.478 --> 07:02.011
we'll get a trauma panel
and a type and cross for 4.

07:02.012 --> 07:03.677
- Yeah.
- Secondary survey's clear.

07:03.678 --> 07:06.194
His best chance of survival
is to fast-track him to the OR.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.147
Let's do this. Will, you're gonna hang
in there. You'll be all right, buddy.

07:09.171 --> 07:12.703
Okay, you two. Line up. Here we go.

07:12.704 --> 07:15.054
Boom and boom.

07:15.055 --> 07:16.158
$5?!

07:16.170 --> 07:19.170
Yes, and it's not to
gamble. It is for snacks.

07:19.171 --> 07:21.091
And don't spend it all in one place.

07:21.122 --> 07:22.460
- Why not?
- I don't know.

07:22.461 --> 07:25.537
That's what my dad used to tell
me, but it never made sense.

07:25.538 --> 07:27.953
Okay, have at it. Go crazy!

07:27.954 --> 07:29.139
- Yes!
- Yes!

07:38.607 --> 07:39.759
Will?

07:39.791 --> 07:41.859
Will? Oh, my God. Will.

07:41.864 --> 07:43.982
Yeah, this is, uh...
this is Kim, Will's, uh...

07:43.983 --> 07:45.326
- Uh, girlfriend.
- Got a dog.

07:45.327 --> 07:46.862
- Oh, hey, pooch.
- Max is Will's.

07:46.863 --> 07:49.869
I-I took him out for a night hike, and I-I
just came as fast as I could when I heard.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.759
All right, listen. I'll take the dog. Don't
worry... he'll be right outside, okay?

07:52.783 --> 07:54.031
- Okay.
- Turn him round.

07:55.304 --> 07:57.994
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Uh, he's in bad shape.

07:57.994 --> 08:01.262
Look, I don't mean to be brief, but
he needs surgery and we need consent.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.799
Who makes his medical decisions?

08:03.023 --> 08:04.143
Uh, me. I-I-I do.

08:04.175 --> 08:06.062
Just, please, do whatever
you have to do to save him.

08:06.063 --> 08:07.599
Okay.

08:07.823 --> 08:09.070
Ma'am, can you come with me?

08:09.103 --> 08:10.103
Please, please.

08:13.166 --> 08:16.622
Um, could you... could
you scoot down just a bit?

08:16.623 --> 08:18.479
Good, good.

08:18.511 --> 08:23.797
Uh, there's a... a-a
tampon inside... there.

08:23.855 --> 08:25.742
- What?
- Yeah, it's, uh...

08:25.775 --> 08:28.975
it's wedged up there, um,
quite... quite a bit, actually.

08:29.007 --> 08:31.349
Any idea how... how
long it's been in there?

08:31.355 --> 08:32.335
No.

08:32.336 --> 08:35.119
Honestly, I-I remember
taking one out, but...

08:35.150 --> 08:37.934
I must have accidentally
put a second one in.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.847
F-M-L. I am never getting drunk again.

08:40.879 --> 08:42.383
Um...

08:42.414 --> 08:44.998
Did you know you have a rash
on the bottom of your feet?

08:44.999 --> 08:47.183
Yeah, I... I don't even know what that is.

08:47.209 --> 08:49.083
But you should see our dorm showers.

08:49.373 --> 08:53.406
Okay. Um, I think this may
be toxic shock syndrome.

08:53.483 --> 08:56.109
Is that bad? Th-th-that's bad, right?

08:56.110 --> 08:58.232
Uh, I-it would be if we
hadn't found it early enough.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.847
Um, good news is, we
did, so we can treat it.

09:00.879 --> 09:03.182
That's a relief. Don't
know how "death by tampon"

09:03.215 --> 09:04.407
would have looked on my headstone.

09:04.431 --> 09:05.614
Uh, o-okay.

09:05.647 --> 09:06.991
Uh, you can get dressed now.

09:07.022 --> 09:08.399
I'm gonna, uh, send the...

09:08.431 --> 09:10.574
the tampon to the lab for
a gram stain and culture,

09:10.575 --> 09:12.057
and get you started on antibiotics.

09:12.081 --> 09:14.671
Let's start with 600
of, uh, clindamycin. Um.

09:14.702 --> 09:16.526
And, uh, yeah.

09:21.455 --> 09:23.183
You okay?

09:23.215 --> 09:24.215
What's wrong?

09:24.239 --> 09:26.671
Help!

09:26.703 --> 09:28.174
- Help! Mom!
- Isabella!

09:28.175 --> 09:29.965
- Mommy!
- Doctor! Doctor!

09:29.966 --> 09:31.985
Start her on 5 of nebulized albuterol.

09:31.986 --> 09:33.687
Mother said she had
asthma when she was little,

09:33.711 --> 09:35.205
but she hasn't had an attack in years.

09:35.206 --> 09:36.794
Okay, well, tell her
stress can cause a relapse

09:36.818 --> 09:37.818
- in symptoms.
- Okay.

09:42.733 --> 09:44.555
That's it, Isabella. You're doing great.

09:44.556 --> 09:46.319
Big, deep, slow breath for me.

09:48.751 --> 09:52.943
TC! Out here! It's the brother.

09:54.639 --> 09:55.908
Oh, what the hell?

09:55.909 --> 09:57.295
It's getting worse!

09:57.327 --> 09:58.255
Okay, Drew!

09:58.256 --> 10:00.143
On it! Here, let's get him to Trauma 3.

10:00.175 --> 10:01.966
This the girl's brother?

10:01.967 --> 10:03.273
Yeah.

10:03.274 --> 10:05.103
This is getting weird.

10:11.590 --> 10:13.510
His buddy said that his chute didn't open.

10:13.511 --> 10:15.597
He's lucky he hit that
tree before he hit the bus.

10:15.598 --> 10:16.465
Was there anybody in it?

10:16.466 --> 10:18.540
No. Luckily they just park there overnight.

10:18.557 --> 10:20.476
So, all told, could have been a lot worse.

10:20.477 --> 10:22.213
Well, it's amazing there's
no spinal-cord damage.

10:22.237 --> 10:24.701
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.

10:24.733 --> 10:25.597
What is that?

10:25.598 --> 10:27.196
Multiple masses.

10:27.197 --> 10:29.757
It's... it's probably cancer.

10:29.789 --> 10:31.170
You see these clumps of tissue?

10:31.171 --> 10:32.830
That means that it's metastasized.

10:32.861 --> 10:34.397
We're gonna take it out, right?

10:34.398 --> 10:35.612
Not without consent.

10:35.613 --> 10:39.549
I'm gonna finish cleaning the
spleen and page an oncologist.

10:39.550 --> 10:42.173
You should go talk to the
girlfriend to get her consent.

10:42.417 --> 10:43.754
Yeah. Okay.

10:47.534 --> 10:49.301
Um, hey. So, the...

10:49.302 --> 10:50.877
the lab, um, says that the...

10:50.909 --> 10:53.693
the tampon was covered in semen.

10:53.725 --> 10:55.608
Well, now we know how
it got wedged up there.

10:55.609 --> 10:57.790
Uh, right. So, listen,
I'm actually not really,

10:57.821 --> 10:59.965
um, comfortable talking
to Lorelei about it.

10:59.966 --> 11:01.309
Paul, she's not your grandmother.

11:01.341 --> 11:02.590
It's your job. Just do it.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.213
You know how many infected
penises I had to examine?

11:05.245 --> 11:06.623
That's not funny.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.987
Oh, I've got a dog to
feed. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

11:10.141 --> 11:11.325
Hey, they like cheese, right?

11:11.357 --> 11:13.347
Uh, dairy actually gives them gas.

11:13.348 --> 11:16.957
I'm sorry. I guess I should have brought
snacks for him, but I wasn't thinking.

11:16.990 --> 11:18.524
Kim, can I talk to you for a second?

11:18.525 --> 11:19.740
Is Will okay?

11:19.741 --> 11:21.789
Um, we found something.

11:21.790 --> 11:23.510
Hey, what about peanut butter?

11:23.511 --> 11:25.693
- You're not really a dog person, are you?
- Uh.

11:25.725 --> 11:27.036
Where is this dog, anyway?

11:27.037 --> 11:29.084
He's tied up outside,
fricking barking like crazy.

11:29.085 --> 11:31.109
I'd be barking like crazy too
if somebody left me out there.

11:31.133 --> 11:33.701
You know what? Um, give him my
sandwich. It's chicken. He'll like it.

11:33.725 --> 11:35.645
Hey, so, uh, y-you can't talk to Lorelei?

11:35.677 --> 11:37.949
No. You're gonna have to do
it. I have a lumbar puncture.

11:37.981 --> 11:40.029
Just remember, if you're
feeling uncomfortable,

11:40.061 --> 11:42.749
imagine how uncomfortable she feels.

11:44.765 --> 11:47.420
Okay, we got two sick kids. What
did your exam of the boy reveal?

11:47.421 --> 11:49.477
Benign abdomen, but persistent
vomiting and diarrhea.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.387
Sounds like a stomach
flu. But no fever, and

11:51.412 --> 11:53.441
doesn't explain the girl's
respiratory symptoms.

11:53.442 --> 11:54.633
Maybe it's psychogenic.

11:54.634 --> 11:57.477
Two different emotional responses
to seeing their father's trauma.

11:57.511 --> 12:00.188
- Within minutes of each other? Unlikely.
- I thought it might be food poisoning, so

12:00.189 --> 12:02.340
I asked the mom where they shop,
who does the cooking at home,

12:02.341 --> 12:03.959
if they've been using
herbs from a garden...

12:03.965 --> 12:06.077
- Way to take the initiative.
- Oh, thanks.

12:07.453 --> 12:08.828
And...?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.621
Oh. Uh, they eat the same thing every day.

12:10.653 --> 12:12.765
But she did say that they've
been really tired lately.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.428
Probably from working at night as janitors.

12:14.429 --> 12:16.220
Some people got to do what
they got to do to survive.

12:16.221 --> 12:17.436
I had a job at 12.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.230
If it helps, I can run point on this...

12:20.241 --> 12:21.797
be the middleman for all the information.

12:21.821 --> 12:25.820
All right, you got the job. Let's
solve this. I hate seeing sick kids.

12:25.821 --> 12:26.879
I'm gonna go check on him.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.788
Yo, Toph. Uh, there's a call for you
on line three about the base jumper.

12:29.789 --> 12:32.188
Let me guess... they want to sue the
city for putting a bus in the way.

12:32.189 --> 12:33.533
Yeah.

12:33.565 --> 12:35.708
What? How is that even possible?

12:35.709 --> 12:39.037
Um... Right. Uh, well, it...
it seems as though you...

12:39.069 --> 12:41.984
you accidentally had, uh,
intercourse with the tampon in,

12:41.990 --> 12:44.769
which is... You know, then
how it got lodged up there.

12:44.770 --> 12:47.592
I mean, you're joking, right? I-I-I
haven't even had sex in like eight months.

12:47.593 --> 12:50.332
Unless this was immaculate
conception part two,

12:50.339 --> 12:53.245
this could not have
happened. I did not have sex,

12:53.245 --> 12:55.381
so how the hell did
sperm get inside of me?!

12:59.261 --> 13:00.573
She still has bronchospasm.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.173
Try adding Atrovent.

13:02.205 --> 13:04.541
- You guys mind if I talk to her?
- Yeah, of course.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.425
We're done here. Later, gator.

13:09.853 --> 13:13.701
There's a bunch of games on
there that my daughter loves.

13:13.719 --> 13:14.685
Cool!

13:14.685 --> 13:15.503
Mm-hmm.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.492
How's my brother? Did he
really puke all over a nurse?

13:18.493 --> 13:20.601
Oh, yeah. He got her good.

13:20.602 --> 13:22.149
But he's resting right now.

13:22.173 --> 13:23.420
And so is your dad.

13:23.421 --> 13:25.272
Good. He works way too hard.

13:25.273 --> 13:27.556
It's time for you to
rest right now, too, okay?

13:27.616 --> 13:29.756
We'll have you all feeling
better before you know it.

13:29.757 --> 13:33.020
Can you send my mom in? I
want to show her these games.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.685
Yeah. You betcha.

13:34.717 --> 13:35.869
Thanks.

13:43.164 --> 13:45.381
So, the girlfriend said that
he had cancer a few years back,

13:45.405 --> 13:47.485
but he's been in remission.
She's pretty devastated.

13:47.517 --> 13:49.564
This is tough. It's pretty advanced.

13:49.565 --> 13:51.356
She wants us to do everything we can.

13:51.357 --> 13:55.672
Great. Let's start the debulking procedure.
Have you ever done a liver lobectomy?

13:55.915 --> 13:57.911
- No. No, I haven't.
- Well, you will today.

13:57.912 --> 13:59.951
We're gonna do an ultrasound
first. I want to map

13:59.975 --> 14:02.005
the biliary tree. I don't
want to leak any bile.

14:03.069 --> 14:05.128
Dr Zia, what do we owe the pleasure...

14:05.129 --> 14:07.736
You have to stop what you're doing
right now. He can't have the surgery.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.181
What?

14:09.213 --> 14:11.548
You are not Will's health
proxy. His brother is.

14:11.549 --> 14:15.325
- I just spoke to him on the phone.
- No. Will's brother's lying.

14:15.357 --> 14:16.796
He's not lying, Kim.

14:16.797 --> 14:19.709
He faxed over proof.
That's the health proxy

14:19.741 --> 14:23.109
and a DNR signed by Will three months ago.

14:23.762 --> 14:25.410
He knew his cancer was back.

14:25.915 --> 14:27.617
Why wouldn't he have told me?

14:27.658 --> 14:28.988
I-I know this is hard...

14:29.007 --> 14:32.605
You have to operate on him.
I swear he would want you to.

14:32.637 --> 14:35.495
I would love to operate
on him, but I'm sorry.

14:35.519 --> 14:38.492
I can't, okay? I have
to respect his wishes.

14:38.525 --> 14:40.220
I'm not letting Will die.

14:40.221 --> 14:43.357
I'm gonna get a lawyer,
and I'm gonna fight this.

14:43.581 --> 14:45.181
This isn't over.

14:48.157 --> 14:50.461
Hey, Rick!

14:50.493 --> 14:51.997
- Hey...
- What are you do...

14:52.104 --> 14:53.480
Hurt your leg?

14:53.496 --> 14:55.677
Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.
It's probably nothing.

14:56.014 --> 14:57.968
- Look, do you have a second?
- Yeah.

14:57.969 --> 15:00.684
- Yeah, let me just, ah find Drew.
- Actually, let's not.

15:01.309 --> 15:02.525
I'm serious.

15:08.738 --> 15:10.138
You fighting with Drew, or something?

15:10.149 --> 15:13.367
No. Well, you know. I'm
sure he tells you everything.

15:13.368 --> 15:16.413
I don't know about "everything". You
know, I'm sure it's an adjustment.

15:16.424 --> 15:18.587
And... and, no, I don't mean
this as in your amputation.

15:18.588 --> 15:20.992
Uh, although it is. I
just mean living together.

15:20.993 --> 15:23.842
Yeah. No, it's... it's all an adjustment.

15:25.039 --> 15:25.718
So, is it broken?

15:25.718 --> 15:28.239
No, but it's a pretty bad sprain.
We're gonna need to splint it.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.432
What?

15:30.433 --> 15:32.450
I sprained my ankle.

15:32.926 --> 15:34.539
Say it.

15:34.556 --> 15:36.301
I sprained my only ankle.

15:36.348 --> 15:38.242
- Rick...
- No, no. I'm messing with you.

15:38.279 --> 15:40.184
I lost my leg, not my sense of humor.

15:40.185 --> 15:42.548
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm...
oh, God. I'm just in work mode.

15:42.549 --> 15:44.701
- Yeah. Sure.
- Let's get you splinted.

15:45.377 --> 15:47.601
Oh, hey.

15:48.471 --> 15:51.479
Uh, do you mind if I take a look
at your other leg? Just for a sec?

15:51.485 --> 15:54.018
Yeah.

15:55.821 --> 15:56.991
- I got it.
- Okay.

16:07.605 --> 16:09.269
You know what?

16:09.301 --> 16:11.572
I would love to get Dr
Chavez in here for a minute.

16:11.573 --> 16:13.461
He's taking over Scott's surgical cases,

16:13.493 --> 16:15.606
and it would just be good
to get him up to speed.

16:15.637 --> 16:17.589
Sure.

16:17.622 --> 16:19.382
All right. I'll be right back.

16:24.789 --> 16:26.149
He's our little secret.

16:26.149 --> 16:28.820
It's far too cold outside
for this handsome fellow.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.773
- Ah, he's so cute.
- I know.

16:30.806 --> 16:32.309
He reminds me of my old dog Cooper.

16:32.310 --> 16:33.968
Don't you, buddy? Don't you?

16:33.969 --> 16:36.276
- Jocelyn, thank you so much.
- No worries.

16:36.277 --> 16:37.622
See you later, buddy.

16:39.317 --> 16:42.230
Um, so, spoke with Lorelei.

16:42.261 --> 16:44.150
She swears she hasn't
had sex in eight months.

16:44.181 --> 16:46.432
Well, she might be self-conscious
because you're a male doctor

16:46.433 --> 16:48.158
and you're close in age,
so it can be a little...

16:48.182 --> 16:51.990
Awkward? Yeah. Now she's getting really
upset. I-I don't really know what to do.

16:52.022 --> 16:55.282
Okay. Well, then, I'll talk
to her with you. Come on.

16:55.323 --> 16:57.782
Oh, now you'll talk to her.

16:57.782 --> 17:00.797
I-I meant that in a good way.

17:00.798 --> 17:04.848
Look, I told him and I'm telling
you, I haven't had sex recently.

17:04.874 --> 17:08.757
You think I'm lying. I'm not lying.
I've been living like a nun, I swear.

17:08.758 --> 17:09.845
Okay.

17:10.498 --> 17:11.796
Sort of.

17:11.797 --> 17:12.950
Sort of?

17:12.981 --> 17:16.981
It's okay. Whatever you
say, it's between us.

17:17.526 --> 17:21.236
The other night, I went to a
frat party with one of my friends

17:21.266 --> 17:26.324
'cause she was really into one of the
pledges. And we were drinking,

17:26.325 --> 17:29.970
and someone offered us a
pill, said it was Molly.

17:29.988 --> 17:31.600
- Okay.
- I only took a little,

17:32.280 --> 17:34.645
but after that the night's a blur.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.891
That's never happened to me before.

17:36.963 --> 17:40.404
Okay. Well, Molly
doesn't cause memory loss,

17:40.421 --> 17:43.931
so I'd like to run a tox screen to see if
we can identify what you may have taken.

17:45.117 --> 17:48.309
Okay. Hang in there.

17:48.341 --> 17:49.526
All right.

17:52.473 --> 17:55.553
She was a little more forthcoming that
time. Uh, what do you think is going on?

17:55.565 --> 17:58.418
I'm not sure. Okay, let's run the tox
screen and see if it'll tell us something

17:58.419 --> 18:00.757
that she won't, okay?

18:00.789 --> 18:03.029
- Rick.
- Hi.

18:03.030 --> 18:04.528
- It's Dr Chavez.
- Hey. Good to meet you.

18:04.529 --> 18:05.714
- Nice to meet you.
- Krista caught me up.

18:05.715 --> 18:09.048
- How's the post-op pain?
- Uh, some minor irritation, you know.

18:09.238 --> 18:11.125
Well, that's... that's not minor.

18:11.158 --> 18:13.397
That's a seroma. Those
can be pretty painful.

18:13.430 --> 18:14.394
I can handle it.

18:14.430 --> 18:16.966
I'm sure you can, but I'm
going to have to aspirate.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.798
Which is just a fancy word for
sticking me with a big needle.

18:19.829 --> 18:21.717
Yes, basically.

18:21.718 --> 18:22.869
- Rick?
- Hey.

18:22.901 --> 18:24.699
Jocelyn told me you were
here. Is everything okay?

18:24.717 --> 18:25.364
Yeah, it's fine.

18:25.370 --> 18:26.574
You hurt your ankle.
Here, let me take a look...

18:26.598 --> 18:29.013
no, no, no. It's okay.
Krista took care of it.

18:29.745 --> 18:31.051
She did?

18:32.126 --> 18:34.133
I didn't know that.

18:34.165 --> 18:36.556
So, how long have you been here?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.789
Uh, he's got a seroma I
need to aspirate, actually.

18:40.790 --> 18:43.447
Dr Chavez, Topher needs to speak to you

18:43.470 --> 18:45.530
about the base jumper's
health proxy and DNR.

18:45.531 --> 18:46.855
Okay. I'll be right there. Um...

18:46.856 --> 18:48.605
Ah... go ahead. I-I can aspirate.

18:48.629 --> 18:50.900
Okay. Nice meeting you.

18:50.901 --> 18:52.820
Yeah.

18:52.821 --> 18:55.318
I think I can do it. You've done enough.

18:57.494 --> 18:59.093
Thanks.

19:01.205 --> 19:04.019
I tried. We can't
operate on the base jumper.

19:04.020 --> 19:06.019
I just spoke with the hospital
lawyer, the brother's lawyer, and

19:06.043 --> 19:07.870
Kim's lawyer. I never want to
talk to another lawyer again.

19:07.894 --> 19:09.940
Okay, well, Kim told me
she thinks she can win.

19:09.941 --> 19:11.990
Well, our lawyer says that
she doesn't have a case.

19:12.021 --> 19:14.069
If she were his wife, the
law would see it differently.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.997
Yeah, look, they've been
together for years, okay?

19:16.021 --> 19:17.397
She knows him better than anyone,

19:17.398 --> 19:19.953
and she says to remove the tumors. So...

19:19.954 --> 19:21.722
- We should remove them.
- I agree. This sucks,

19:21.734 --> 19:23.669
but he signed the DNR without telling her.

19:23.670 --> 19:24.948
That's for a reason.

19:24.949 --> 19:28.213
How many times have we seen people
sign DNRs, and as soon as they go South,

19:28.214 --> 19:29.878
the family's screaming to revive them.

19:29.909 --> 19:31.797
If the brother was here,
he might think differently.

19:31.798 --> 19:33.685
You know, TC, I-I don't know about that.

19:33.718 --> 19:37.062
Sometimes you see a family member
in distress, and it makes it easier.

19:37.074 --> 19:40.769
Not in my experience... how you
fight until you can't fight anymore.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.284
Okay, a-as much as I love a good debate,

19:43.285 --> 19:46.996
what we would or wouldn't do is
irrelevant, so until we hear further,

19:46.997 --> 19:49.429
let's just keep him stable
and comfortable, okay?

19:49.430 --> 19:50.516
No heroic effort.

19:50.517 --> 19:52.117
Doctors, we need you.

19:53.270 --> 19:55.996
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy! Someone help her!

19:58.093 --> 20:00.093
Has there been tonic-clonic
activity the whole time?

20:00.117 --> 20:01.840
- Yeah.
- Make it stop!

20:01.851 --> 20:03.325
Okay, let's have 10 of Diazepam.

20:03.343 --> 20:05.365
Okay. Hand me an Ambu-bag and place a line.

20:05.398 --> 20:07.058
Can't get an IV on her.
She's moving too much.

20:07.059 --> 20:09.461
Okay. Give it to me. I'll go IM.

20:10.332 --> 20:12.130
What the hell's going on with this family?

20:12.131 --> 20:13.336
Come on.

20:17.335 --> 20:19.285
All I wanted to do was
read a book on the sofa,

20:19.286 --> 20:22.525
and the light went out.

20:22.573 --> 20:23.885
I was trying to change a bulb.

20:23.917 --> 20:25.612
Wait, so you got up on a ladder?

20:25.613 --> 20:27.405
Rick, our ceilings are 12 feet high.

20:27.437 --> 20:29.174
Why didn't you just wait until I got home?

20:29.181 --> 20:31.536
Because I'm your boyfriend, not your
child. That's why I went to Krista.

20:31.554 --> 20:34.181
I don't want you to have to...
Do every damn thing for me.

20:34.206 --> 20:38.829
- Just relax, all right? It's a light bulb.
- Yeah, exactly. It's just a light bulb.

20:38.861 --> 20:41.504
I was a guy who could practically
build a house from the ground up.

20:41.516 --> 20:43.098
Just gonna take a little
bit of time to adapt.

20:43.122 --> 20:45.869
To what? No, really. Adapt to what?

20:45.901 --> 20:48.909
Forget that I'll never be able to
lead my troops into combat again.

20:48.910 --> 20:52.476
Forget that we'll never be able to
climb Machu Picchu like we talked about.

20:52.499 --> 20:54.722
Forget that I'll never be able to
build a house from the ground up.

20:54.734 --> 20:57.037
I can't even change a damn light bulb.

20:57.069 --> 20:58.543
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

20:58.567 --> 21:00.748
- I know it's hard.
- No, you don't.

21:00.749 --> 21:04.653
You can imagine, but you don't
understand what it's like.

21:04.684 --> 21:08.589
Every day, I try to do
something I used to...

21:08.621 --> 21:10.833
I'm reminded I'm not that guy anymore.

21:10.844 --> 21:13.324
- But eventually you will...
- Drew, stop.

21:13.357 --> 21:14.797
Please.

21:14.829 --> 21:17.772
Stop trying to make
everything better. You can't.

21:17.997 --> 21:22.957
I appreciate everything you've
done for me. I really do.

21:22.989 --> 21:24.365
And I love you.

21:24.397 --> 21:26.348
And I love you.

21:26.349 --> 21:29.932
Drew, I don't know who I am anymore.

21:29.933 --> 21:33.132
I'm not the guy you fell in love with.

21:33.357 --> 21:37.453
I'm not even a guy I like anymore.

21:37.485 --> 21:40.108
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

21:40.141 --> 21:41.420
Do what?

21:43.917 --> 21:45.453
I'm moving out.

21:46.924 --> 21:49.004
It's okay, Maria. You just had a seizure.

21:49.005 --> 21:51.116
We're gonna run you
upstairs for some tests.

21:51.149 --> 21:52.844
Lorelei's tox screen came back negative.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.557
Well, it's been 48 hours, so the drugs
are probably out of her system by now.

21:56.589 --> 21:58.669
Looks like her RA's back to pick her up.

21:58.700 --> 21:59.629
Uh, what do we do?

21:59.660 --> 22:01.805
I think we should talk to her again.

22:01.837 --> 22:04.364
Um, I'll be right in.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.037
Hey. I walked him around the
block. He did his business.

22:07.062 --> 22:09.933
Of course he did, 'cause
he's a good boy! Yes, he is!

22:09.964 --> 22:11.916
Thank you so much. I appreciate it.

22:11.917 --> 22:12.877
Come on, buddy.

22:12.909 --> 22:14.764
- Hey, Drew. Do you want to meet Max?
- No

22:14.797 --> 22:16.068
Okay.

22:16.940 --> 22:19.085
- Hey, Drew, you got a sec?
- Not really.

22:19.116 --> 22:22.700
Come on, Drew. Come on. Look, I'm
sorry that I didn't come and get you,

22:22.733 --> 22:24.662
and Rick asked me not to, and I
just didn't know what to do, and

22:24.663 --> 22:26.412
I don't want to be in the middle.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.053
You don't have to worry about that anymore.

22:28.077 --> 22:28.741
What does that mean?

22:28.760 --> 22:30.773
Hey, Drew, I got a dislocated
shoulder. Can you take it?

22:30.790 --> 22:35.340
- Can't somebody else?
- They said everybody's busy. Come on.

22:35.341 --> 22:37.707
Yeah, I got it. I'll talk to you later.

22:37.708 --> 22:39.180
Yeah.

22:39.181 --> 22:41.547
Hey, Dr Chavez, is that base
jumper's girlfriend around?

22:41.548 --> 22:43.116
His buddy gave me some of his things.

22:43.149 --> 22:44.180
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:44.192 --> 22:47.686
Well, um, no. He's actually not doing
too well. It's getting complicated.

22:47.692 --> 22:50.880
- Oh, man. Okay,
- Buy you a coffee, tell you about it?

22:50.881 --> 22:52.084
So glad you're feeling better.

22:52.108 --> 22:55.405
I never thought I'd be desperate to
get back to my crappy dorm mattress.

22:55.436 --> 22:57.485
Oh, here.

23:03.853 --> 23:04.939
Let's go, huh?

23:04.940 --> 23:06.541
Oh.

23:06.573 --> 23:09.773
- Are... are you okay?
- Well, uh, I-I feel a little shaky.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.563
Um, maybe I should...

23:11.564 --> 23:13.517
Sit down for a sec? Definitely. Come on.

23:15.246 --> 23:16.811
I thought you said you were fine.

23:16.817 --> 23:20.109
Sorry. Maybe it's just
I haven't eaten lately.

23:21.086 --> 23:24.012
Okay, I'd like to examine her,
so if you could step out, please?

23:24.013 --> 23:26.989
- Thank you.
- Sure.

23:27.020 --> 23:29.388
I'd like to check your pulse, okay?

23:29.389 --> 23:31.819
There's
nothing wrong with my pulse.

23:34.625 --> 23:37.261
I just had a flashback of the other night.

23:37.293 --> 23:39.500
It's still a little fuzzy, but...

23:41.068 --> 23:44.905
I remember being at the party
and being a little out of it...

23:45.805 --> 23:47.949
And Kyle was there.

23:47.981 --> 23:51.817
He walked me back to my dorm...

23:52.429 --> 23:54.956
And he pushed his way inside.

23:58.829 --> 24:02.092
I-I was too weak to fight him off.

24:04.429 --> 24:08.396
He... He raped me.

24:10.189 --> 24:13.645
Oh, honey. I am so sorry.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.524
Please, you have to do something.

24:17.548 --> 24:20.154
Just, please, do something!

24:20.160 --> 24:22.658
He's crashing. Tachy and
OÂ² sats are dropping.

24:22.659 --> 24:24.653
Diffuse rhonchi. He must have aspirated.

24:24.685 --> 24:26.221
Get me an intubation tray.

24:26.253 --> 24:28.172
No, no. No, he has a DNR. You know that.

24:28.173 --> 24:30.476
Please, you have to help him.

24:30.509 --> 24:32.429
- Okay.
- Tee, no. No, y-you hearing me?

24:32.460 --> 24:33.389
He has a DNR.

24:33.420 --> 24:35.494
So his brother can sue me,
okay? I'm on Kim's side.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.759
You can't just disregard what
I say. I'm running this shift.

24:37.771 --> 24:40.354
Okay, it's nothing personal. I
disregard what everybody says.

24:40.384 --> 24:43.413
Look, I-I'm not everybody.
I hate this part of the job.

24:43.431 --> 24:46.571
Then don't do this part of
the job, okay? Do it your way,

24:46.588 --> 24:48.327
not the way you think
it's supposed to be done.

24:48.333 --> 24:52.234
So either leave and I'll say you
were never here, or step in and help.

24:56.688 --> 24:57.741
Thank you.

25:40.173 --> 25:43.117
I shouldn't have drank so much.

25:43.148 --> 25:47.275
- I shouldn't have flirted with him.
- Lorelei, this is not your fault.

25:47.276 --> 25:49.516
It doesn't matter how much you drank,

25:49.549 --> 25:51.724
what you wore, what you said, what you did.

25:51.757 --> 25:53.809
If you didn't consent, he had no right.

25:53.821 --> 25:55.852
That guy is right outside. Okay?

25:55.864 --> 25:57.991
We can do an ARV kit, get
that son of a bitch arrested.

25:57.992 --> 25:58.345
Paul.

25:58.351 --> 25:59.976
L-look, you don't have
to decide right away.

25:59.994 --> 26:00.965
- Paul.
- If you want to press charges...

26:00.977 --> 26:03.340
- Paul, stop!
- The sooner we collect...

26:05.037 --> 26:06.061
At this point,

26:06.092 --> 26:08.589
nothing we collect would be admissible.

26:08.621 --> 26:11.692
The chain of evidence was
broken when you examined her.

26:11.725 --> 26:13.630
I'm so sorry.

26:13.640 --> 26:15.913
So he's just gonna get away with this?!

26:15.919 --> 26:16.909
Evidence wise,

26:16.910 --> 26:18.508
it is a setback.

26:18.541 --> 26:21.193
But we had no way of knowing.

26:21.194 --> 26:25.291
We are going to do everything that we can.

26:25.292 --> 26:29.101
Okay, I need to speak with Paul.

26:29.132 --> 26:31.788
I'll be back in a few minutes, okay?

26:31.789 --> 26:32.812
Paul.

26:36.844 --> 26:38.860
Okay, you need to calm down.

26:38.861 --> 26:40.651
This is not your fault.

26:40.652 --> 26:42.701
Any one of us would
have done the same thing.

26:42.733 --> 26:44.302
Yes, it's terrible, okay?

26:44.314 --> 26:46.541
But we have no way of knowing for sure.

26:46.573 --> 26:48.012
But we do know, okay? She was assaulted.

26:48.025 --> 26:50.446
I think she was too, but
we are not the police.

26:50.447 --> 26:51.321
We can call them, though, right?

26:51.322 --> 26:53.964
That's not up to us.
Okay, she may not want to.

26:53.965 --> 26:56.077
Ultimately, it's her decision.

26:56.108 --> 26:59.945
And, some people, they just
need to take baby steps.

27:00.429 --> 27:02.093
Okay?

27:02.316 --> 27:06.668
Yeah. Okay, okay. I hear you.
I just... I don't like it.

27:06.701 --> 27:08.205
I don't either.

27:15.341 --> 27:17.131
So, you intubated Will.

27:17.132 --> 27:18.284
I did.

27:18.317 --> 27:19.628
You shouldn't have.

27:19.629 --> 27:21.549
He didn't want to suffer, okay?

27:21.580 --> 27:23.828
- He signed the DNR. That was his choice.
- Three months ago.

27:23.852 --> 27:25.771
Who knows what he would have wanted today?

27:25.772 --> 27:28.396
Actually, I do.

27:29.002 --> 27:31.405
Gwen gave me his things, and
I found this in his wallet.

27:36.332 --> 27:39.180
"You're my everything, Kim. I love you."

27:39.181 --> 27:42.284
In time, I hope you come
to understand my decision.

27:42.317 --> 27:44.108
I didn't want to burden you,

27:44.141 --> 27:46.957
and I need my life to
end the way I lived it...

27:46.988 --> 27:48.555
"on my terms."

27:48.556 --> 27:50.348
You were wrong, TC.

27:50.349 --> 27:53.708
He didn't open his parachute on purpose.

27:53.741 --> 27:56.045
He wanted to die.

28:04.172 --> 28:05.607
We know what you did, prick.

28:05.614 --> 28:06.662
- What?
- You're an RA.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.107
You're responsible for
the safety of those kids!

28:08.125 --> 28:09.515
Instead, you go and sexually assault her?!

28:09.527 --> 28:11.462
- What's wrong with you?!
- Assault? Dude, get off me!

28:11.474 --> 28:13.748
She told us, okay? You walked
her to her dorm and... and then...

28:13.772 --> 28:17.186
And then we hooked up! So what?
Dude, she was all over me that night.

28:17.204 --> 28:18.356
I was just giving her what she wanted.

28:18.357 --> 28:20.646
Lorelei couldn't even tell you what
she wanted because she was drugged.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.157
But you decided what you wanted.
You... you forcibly took it, right?

28:23.169 --> 28:24.523
No. That's not how it went down.

28:24.547 --> 28:27.024
Was she even awake when... when you did it?

28:27.497 --> 28:29.005
I don't have to answer to you.

28:29.036 --> 28:32.011
- You're not going anywhere, okay?
- Okay. Get out of my way.

28:36.844 --> 28:38.475
Hey!

28:38.476 --> 28:40.235
Paul!

28:41.581 --> 28:42.667
Oh, my God.

28:42.668 --> 28:44.204
Hey! Hey!

28:44.205 --> 28:46.251
You son of a bitch!

28:46.252 --> 28:47.341
Get him off me!

28:52.166 --> 28:54.181
After everything Kim's been through...

28:54.182 --> 28:55.844
Now we have to give her the note.

28:55.845 --> 28:58.022
She's in enough pain
already. Why make it worse?

28:58.728 --> 29:03.039
What do you mean? You're not going
to? I mean, she deserves to know.

29:03.056 --> 29:05.633
No. No, no. So she'll be wracked with
guilt 'cause she didn't see the signs?

29:05.634 --> 29:07.612
So she'll blame herself for
something that wasn't her fault?

29:07.630 --> 29:10.699
No, I know, but... these
are his last words to her.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.158
And sometimes the last words hurt the most.

29:18.181 --> 29:22.128
Hey, sweetie, I know you've
been asking about your mom.

29:22.129 --> 29:24.904
That was real scary what
you saw. But don't worry.

29:24.923 --> 29:28.999
The doctors are gonna take really
good care of her. She's gonna be okay.

29:29.412 --> 29:31.364
- Isabella?
- I can't hear you!

29:31.365 --> 29:33.780
- Okay, look at me. I'll be right back.
- Why can't I hear anything?!

29:33.804 --> 29:36.579
- Give me one second.
- Mr Ragosa? No. Mr Ragosa, please help me!

29:36.609 --> 29:38.341
Hey, TC, Topher! The girl
just lost her hearing!

29:38.365 --> 29:39.941
Yeah. Okay, we're on it.

29:40.019 --> 29:42.734
Can you talk to the mother? She's
screaming about somebody named Rosario,

29:42.752 --> 29:45.299
- but we can't find him.
- I don't think Rosario's a person.

29:45.347 --> 29:47.565
I think she's asking for her
rosary beads. Check her purse.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.989
- Got it.
- Get the keys and I'll check their truck.

29:51.135 --> 29:52.705
You, tough guy, come with me.

29:52.747 --> 29:55.822
I'm bleeding. I'm gonna
sue this entire hospital!

29:55.833 --> 29:59.467
- For what? I didn't see anything.
- Me neither.

29:59.499 --> 30:01.387
There you go sweetie.

30:01.419 --> 30:05.386
Okay. All right, first of all, you
were like a junkyard dog in there, baby.

30:05.387 --> 30:09.067
I mean, you really gave it to him.
You gave him the one-two.

30:09.099 --> 30:12.362
We... but we got to work on your left,
all right? Your left isn't turning over.

30:12.363 --> 30:14.923
Your left... what started that?

30:14.955 --> 30:16.884
He raped my patient.

30:19.179 --> 30:21.098
Wow. Really?

30:21.099 --> 30:22.634
Yeah.

30:22.635 --> 30:27.339
Good fight, man. Way to
step up. I'm proud of you.

30:57.323 --> 30:58.795
BP's dropping.

30:59.741 --> 31:00.861
Her lungs are filled with secretions.

31:00.885 --> 31:02.510
We have to intubate. Okay,
push the ketamine now.

31:02.534 --> 31:04.042
Her sats are down to 70%.

31:04.043 --> 31:05.258
I think I figured out what's wrong!

31:05.259 --> 31:08.011
I found farming tools in the truck,
and the kids' boots caked in mud.

31:08.043 --> 31:10.538
I think it's pesticides, probably
from a second job in the field.

31:10.539 --> 31:13.387
Pesticides. Vomiting,
pulmonary edema, hearing loss...

31:13.419 --> 31:15.339
it all points to organophosphate poisoning.

31:15.371 --> 31:16.499
Organophosphate is supposed to be banned.

31:16.523 --> 31:19.147
- Her sats are not coming up.
- BP's down to 65. She's crashing!

31:19.173 --> 31:21.336
We got to go with this. She
needs atropine. Ragosa, take that.

31:21.342 --> 31:23.370
IV's infiltrated.

31:23.371 --> 31:27.458
- Give me a spinal needle.
- Michael, Betadine. Go.

31:28.043 --> 31:31.403
- All right, sweetie. Stay with us.
- Come on, come on.

31:34.763 --> 31:37.386
It's not working.

31:37.387 --> 31:40.522
Yeah. There we go.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.705
All right.

31:43.729 --> 31:46.411
- Wow, that was, uh...
- Great job.

31:46.443 --> 31:51.787
- Glad you've been studying. You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I just, um...

31:51.819 --> 31:55.498
You got rattled. It's okay. If you
want to be a doctor, get used to it.

31:55.499 --> 31:57.211
Not something you can study for.

32:08.363 --> 32:10.173
Hi, Kim.

32:10.221 --> 32:13.227
We had so many plans.

32:13.259 --> 32:17.095
Whitewater rafting in the Chattooga.

32:17.483 --> 32:19.947
Tandem paraglide in Cape Town.

32:23.435 --> 32:26.987
We were finally gonna run
with the bulls this summer.

32:28.555 --> 32:32.106
I thought we'd get to all of it eventually.

32:32.107 --> 32:35.787
Comes out of nowhere. Doesn't it?

32:37.291 --> 32:41.748
My son spent the last part
of his life in the hospital.

32:43.883 --> 32:45.291
9 years old.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.258
Nothing I could do for him.

32:50.635 --> 32:54.379
Turns out, he was ready to let go.

32:54.411 --> 32:56.395
But I wasn't.

32:56.427 --> 33:00.264
It's the hardest thing, but
you realize at some point...

33:02.091 --> 33:06.058
they're not hanging on for them.

33:06.059 --> 33:08.715
They're hanging on for you.

33:08.747 --> 33:11.823
How do you know when to...?

33:11.865 --> 33:15.275
I've never seen anyone do it too soon.

33:15.307 --> 33:17.419
Only too late.

33:26.795 --> 33:30.378
Hey, um, we found this.

33:30.379 --> 33:32.426
It won't make it any easier,

33:32.427 --> 33:35.467
but may help you to understand.

33:39.196 --> 33:42.011
Maybe Will wanted his
brother to be his proxy

33:42.032 --> 33:45.359
'cause he didn't want you
to have to make the decision.

33:45.380 --> 33:47.172
He wanted to take care of it for you.

33:53.835 --> 33:56.395
That sounds like Will.

34:11.268 --> 34:14.168
He says they moved into a
storage trailer on the farm

34:14.199 --> 34:17.172
where they keep the pesticides, but
they didn't know it was dangerous.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.911
So the farmer has been
using illegal pesticides

34:19.929 --> 34:23.435
and this whole family and any person that
eats those vegetables is being exposed?

34:23.467 --> 34:25.067
That's...

34:25.099 --> 34:29.067
Well, tell... tell him he's got
to move his family out of there.

34:32.590 --> 34:33.610
- SÃ­.
- SÃ­.

34:33.610 --> 34:34.891
Gracias, Doctor.

34:34.922 --> 34:35.915
Gracias.

34:35.915 --> 34:36.915
De nada.

34:40.299 --> 34:41.034
Hey.

34:41.259 --> 34:42.763
Thanks for your help tonight.

34:42.793 --> 34:44.170
Yeah, no problem.

34:44.170 --> 34:46.217
Like I said before, they
could've been my family.

34:46.219 --> 34:47.402
Yeah, mine too.

34:47.435 --> 34:51.402
My dad was an immigrant who worked two
jobs and still couldn't afford the basics.

34:51.402 --> 34:55.370
Oh, what do you know? We actually
do have something in common.

34:55.371 --> 34:59.057
My dad worked construction.
We moved 15 times in 12 years.

34:59.069 --> 35:03.338
Had to go where the work was.
Sure made it difficult to fit in.

35:03.339 --> 35:08.811
- So that's why you're such a dick.
- Yeah. Must be. What's your excuse?

35:18.987 --> 35:21.739
Whoever says that animals
don't have emotions? I mean...

35:21.771 --> 35:24.171
I saw dozens of K9 teams in Afghanistan

35:24.203 --> 35:27.754
sniffing out explosives and
work alongside the handlers.

35:27.755 --> 35:30.934
They feel emotion as much as anyone.

35:30.989 --> 35:32.371
You know, she lives in a small apartment

35:32.395 --> 35:35.019
with her allergic son,
so she can't keep Max.

35:35.475 --> 35:38.519
You mean after all that, Max
is gonna go to the shelter?

35:38.525 --> 35:41.301
No, I mean, she said she
found someone to take him.

35:41.330 --> 35:43.307
Well, I hope it's a good home.

35:47.254 --> 35:50.108
Thank you. Uh, I heard
what you did earlier.

35:50.120 --> 35:53.819
It's nice to know there's
still a few good guys left in the world.

35:53.945 --> 35:56.390
There better be. I, uh... I have a sister.

35:56.403 --> 35:58.603
Lorelei, have you thought
about filing a complaint?

35:58.634 --> 36:03.978
This happens to so many women at
school, and nobody takes them seriously.

36:03.979 --> 36:08.171
You just... Never think
it's gonna happen to you.

36:08.172 --> 36:12.653
Look, it's your call,
but I will go with you

36:12.664 --> 36:15.223
to the Dean, the police, whatever you want.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.298
And so will I.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.980
- Thank you.
- And

36:17.998 --> 36:21.043
I know that this doesn't make things
right, but, um, I called a friend of mine

36:21.062 --> 36:22.699
at the local rape crisis center.

36:22.923 --> 36:29.035
They have all the resources... both medical
and legal. If you choose to move forward.

36:29.067 --> 36:30.730
If you're not ready, it's okay.

36:30.731 --> 36:35.466
But if you are, I'm free this
afternoon. I could take you if you like.

36:35.499 --> 36:37.578
Thank you.

36:44.970 --> 36:46.123
Okay.

36:46.155 --> 36:48.144
Double stack of pancakes,
a couple of grits,

36:48.145 --> 36:50.025
side of bacon, and a
gallon of coffee. Who's in?

36:50.507 --> 36:51.883
I'm out.

36:51.915 --> 36:53.354
I am going to yoga.

36:53.387 --> 36:54.699
You guys want to join?

36:54.731 --> 36:57.003
Yeah, I like my workouts
a little more aggressive.

36:57.035 --> 36:58.922
Your loss.

36:58.923 --> 37:00.523
Yoga? Hell, no.

37:00.555 --> 37:01.555
I'm in.

37:12.010 --> 37:12.875
Hey, Jordan.

37:12.906 --> 37:15.715
Call him. He's all yours.

37:15.727 --> 37:18.251
I thought that Kim said
she found a home for him.

37:18.283 --> 37:19.626
- Hi, buddy.
- Yeah, she did.

37:19.659 --> 37:22.795
With me. But Kim gets visitation rights.

37:22.827 --> 37:23.947
Of course she does.

37:23.978 --> 37:27.562
Oh man. You really milked that.

37:27.595 --> 37:29.705
You said that after all
this, he's going to a shelter.

37:29.716 --> 37:33.099
Am I good, or am I good? You know,
I can help you walk him and feed him

37:33.131 --> 37:34.634
now that I have a key.

37:34.859 --> 37:37.066
And they say most couples
should start with a plant.

37:37.099 --> 37:39.353
Nah, we're way past plants.

37:43.051 --> 37:47.306
Here you go.

37:52.143 --> 37:55.314
Another round.

38:02.826 --> 38:06.038
Go home, Drew.
