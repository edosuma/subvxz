<i>Time travel is real.</i>

00:02.908 --> 00:04.346
<i>And all of history is vulnerable</i>

00:04.371 --> 00:06.475
<i>to the attack of rogue time travelers.</i>

00:06.500 --> 00:08.199
<i>But one group travels throughout time</i>

00:08.201 --> 00:11.036
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called Time Aberrations</i>

00:11.038 --> 00:12.921
<i>and erase their damage to history.</i>

00:12.953 --> 00:14.786
<i>A group of outcasts and misfits.</i>

00:14.788 --> 00:16.562
<i>These individuals aren't heroes,</i>

00:16.594 --> 00:19.173
<i>they're something else, they're Legends.</i>

00:20.188 --> 00:22.389
<i>Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:22.414 --> 00:24.781
Heywood, Dr. Nate Heywood.
I'm a historian.

00:24.783 --> 00:27.417
I specialize in deductive
historical reconstruction.

00:27.419 --> 00:30.120
In layman's terms, I'm a time detective.

00:30.122 --> 00:31.822
Ingestible translator.

00:31.824 --> 00:32.990
You'll be able to speak and understand

00:32.992 --> 00:34.391
any language spoken to you.

00:34.393 --> 00:36.727
You know how fragile
we historians can be.

00:36.729 --> 00:38.195
I know my cuts and bruises.

00:38.197 --> 00:40.330
You're a hemophiliac.
You can bleed to death.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.232
So your superpower is wearing the suit.

00:42.234 --> 00:43.901
<i>Without that fancy suit,</i>

00:43.903 --> 00:45.469
you're nothing but a
self-righteous rich guy.

00:48.474 --> 00:49.973
Mr. Heywood's vitals are dropping.

00:49.975 --> 00:51.375
I think I can save him.

00:51.377 --> 00:53.710
<i>I did a little tinkering to the formula.</i>

00:53.712 --> 00:56.647
Hello, Rex.

00:56.649 --> 00:57.681
Rex!

00:57.683 --> 01:00.317
- Time traveler.
- Rex!

01:10.061 --> 01:12.729
- So how's our patient?
- Still stable.

01:12.731 --> 01:15.299
Gideon has him under sedation.

01:15.301 --> 01:17.668
Any side effects from
the Nazi super-serum

01:17.670 --> 01:19.069
you injected him with?

01:19.071 --> 01:20.938
No, but that may have a
little something to do

01:20.940 --> 01:22.472
with the work I did altering the serum

01:22.474 --> 01:23.674
to remove the Nazi parts.

01:23.676 --> 01:25.375
Yes, it would be a tad inconvenient

01:25.377 --> 01:27.411
to have a monster roaming the ship.

01:35.086 --> 01:37.087
Gideon, can you pilot for a little bit?

01:37.089 --> 01:38.755
I need a break.

02:07.785 --> 02:10.086
Where are all the knives?

02:12.690 --> 02:14.925
Oh, there's one.

02:14.927 --> 02:18.028
Look, if this is about me
taking all the mayonnaise,

02:18.030 --> 02:19.830
you might be slightly overreacting.

02:19.832 --> 02:21.698
You killed him!

02:21.700 --> 02:25.035
Killed him? I've killed lots of people.

02:25.037 --> 02:27.604
You're gonna have to be
a bit more specific.

03:00.171 --> 03:02.673
What the hell happened to you?

03:04.276 --> 03:06.610
I really don't know.

03:08.118 --> 03:10.899
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:15.520 --> 03:17.387
<i>You injected me with Nazi serum?</i>

03:17.389 --> 03:20.123
Which I'd redesigned to
quintuple my own strength

03:20.125 --> 03:22.192
and transform my skin into an alloy

03:22.194 --> 03:23.293
a hundred times stronger than steel.

03:23.295 --> 03:26.029
Steel, that's a cool name.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.165
Yeah, especially since my grandfather

03:28.167 --> 03:29.866
was called Commander Steel.

03:29.868 --> 03:31.435
But what does that make me?

03:31.437 --> 03:33.136
Corporal Steel? Mr. Steel?

03:33.138 --> 03:34.404
Citizen Steel?

03:34.406 --> 03:36.873
Who cares? You got
superpowers now, dude.

03:36.875 --> 03:39.176
Except I don't know
how I turned to steel

03:39.178 --> 03:41.411
- in the first place.
- Ray'll teach you.

03:41.413 --> 03:43.513
- He will?
- You said it yourself,

03:43.515 --> 03:46.717
you redesigned the serum.
Which I did beautifully,

03:46.719 --> 03:49.519
but it's not like I have some
sort of instruction manual.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.021
Guess you'll have to wing it.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.856
Now, I'm gonna go have a chat

03:52.858 --> 03:55.926
with our stowaway.

03:55.928 --> 03:57.394
This is gonna be so much fun!

03:57.396 --> 03:58.695
Hm.

04:06.637 --> 04:10.273
You stowed away before we
time-jumped from 1942.

04:10.275 --> 04:11.541
I'm gonna get out of here,

04:11.543 --> 04:13.977
and I'm gonna finish what I started.

04:13.979 --> 04:16.413
You mean, killing Mick?

04:16.415 --> 04:20.016
Not that I haven't thought
of it myself, but why?

04:20.439 --> 04:22.340
He killed Rex.

04:22.365 --> 04:24.265
What?

04:24.352 --> 04:25.785
Rex Tyler?

04:25.937 --> 04:28.003
As in Hourman?

04:28.075 --> 04:30.943
His killer stole the Askaran Amulet.

04:32.798 --> 04:35.312
Look, I'm sorry. I am.

04:35.337 --> 04:38.138
But Mick didn't do it.

04:38.437 --> 04:40.593
He is a thief and a murderer.

04:40.618 --> 04:42.718
He's also a Legend,

04:42.743 --> 04:44.410
and Mick hasn't been off the ship

04:44.435 --> 04:46.768
since we dropped your
team off at the JSA.

04:46.922 --> 04:48.222
With his last words,

04:48.247 --> 04:50.680
he told me his killer
was a time traveler.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.351
You know, we've been tracking someone

04:54.353 --> 04:56.086
who's been trying to alter history.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.454
We think it's the same person

04:57.456 --> 04:58.989
that gave Krieger the super-serum.

04:58.991 --> 05:01.591
This might be your time traveler.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.494
Look, if I let you out of here,

05:04.496 --> 05:07.631
you promise not to hurt Mick
unless he really deserves it?

05:15.506 --> 05:17.641
Sorry for knocking you out.

05:17.643 --> 05:19.843
Sorry for locking you up.

05:19.845 --> 05:23.213
Call it even?

05:23.215 --> 05:24.781
When I was a kid, I used to play

05:24.783 --> 05:26.683
JSA versus Nazis with my dolls.

05:26.685 --> 05:28.552
Well, they were action figures, really.

05:28.554 --> 05:30.687
But it doesn't matter 'cause
I got superpowers now

05:30.689 --> 05:32.022
and it's awesome.

05:32.024 --> 05:33.457
Your powers manifested

05:33.459 --> 05:35.325
as a result of a heightened
adrenal response.

05:35.327 --> 05:38.628
Basically, Amaya threatened
you and you reacted.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.930
So now

05:39.932 --> 05:41.731
what we need to do is
duplicate the conditions

05:41.733 --> 05:44.668
which caused you to, you know, steel on?

05:44.670 --> 05:46.303
Wait, so you want to threaten me?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.805
- Not exactly.
- Wait, let's discuss this.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.908
I thought this was a time machine.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.678
You saved the Justice Society.
Why can't you save Rex?

05:54.680 --> 05:57.013
Because we're dealing with
another time traveler.

05:57.015 --> 05:59.416
If we go back and save Rex,
the time traveler will just

05:59.418 --> 06:01.084
go back before then and kill Rex again,

06:01.086 --> 06:02.519
so instead of chasing our own tails,

06:02.521 --> 06:04.087
we need to identify
who we're up against.

06:04.089 --> 06:05.388
I don't understand any of this.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.591
Look, I just need you to trust us.

06:07.593 --> 06:09.593
We're gonna find who do this.
I promise you.

06:09.595 --> 06:11.661
In the meantime, Gideon
will fly you home.

06:11.663 --> 06:13.897
I'm not going back until Rex's killer

06:13.899 --> 06:15.999
is brought to justice.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.468
We don't know how long that will take.

06:18.470 --> 06:20.871
Don't worry, we're professionals.

06:20.873 --> 06:21.972
We know what we're doing.

06:29.247 --> 06:32.349
Yeah, come on!

06:32.351 --> 06:35.118
If Grandpa Heywood could see me now.

06:35.120 --> 06:39.189
- Professional?
- Ish.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.724
I know you not

06:40.726 --> 06:43.326
gonna take that, Ray.
Go crush this Tin Man.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.065
- Nice try.
- Come on.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.804
Hold on, I'll close it!

06:58.710 --> 07:00.176
Ah!

07:04.282 --> 07:05.515
Nate!

07:05.517 --> 07:08.218
Ray, get inside! We
have to close the door.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.287
No, I got to go after him.

07:10.289 --> 07:12.556
Gideon, shut the cargo door.

07:23.835 --> 07:25.769
What's happening to the ship?

07:25.771 --> 07:27.904
Jax, what's our status?

07:27.906 --> 07:30.473
<i>I've rerouted power from
the secondary manifolds.</i>

07:30.475 --> 07:32.475
Where are Dr. Palmer and Dr. Heywood?

07:32.477 --> 07:35.812
- Did you check out the window?
- What?

07:35.814 --> 07:38.381
How is it you people haven't
managed to kill yourselves yet?

07:38.383 --> 07:40.917
The day is still young.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.054
- Jax?
- Yeah, I'm working on it.

07:48.025 --> 07:51.628
Gideon, I need you
to track down Ray and Nate

07:51.630 --> 07:54.197
- and take us to their position.
<i>- The explosive decompression</i>

07:54.199 --> 07:55.899
<i>caused us to lose corrective altitude,</i>

07:55.901 --> 07:58.468
<i>which put too much strain on
the station-keeping thrusters.</i>

07:58.470 --> 08:00.670
For God's sake, say it how it is.

08:00.672 --> 08:01.871
We're screwed.

08:01.873 --> 08:04.174
<i>We're screwed.</i>

08:32.602 --> 08:35.071
Edo Period.

08:36.607 --> 08:39.708
Mid-17th century Japan.

08:41.979 --> 08:43.980
That's cool.

08:55.338 --> 08:57.238
Well...

08:57.240 --> 08:59.340
I'm still alive.

09:00.943 --> 09:03.744
So far, so good.

09:09.218 --> 09:10.484
Whoa, Samurais.

09:10.885 --> 09:12.987
_

09:13.198 --> 09:15.464
_

09:15.590 --> 09:17.091
Oh right, almost forgot.

09:25.101 --> 09:27.101
Can you understand me now?

09:27.103 --> 09:28.502
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

09:28.504 --> 09:29.870
Okay, he fell from the sky.

09:29.872 --> 09:32.673
He's about yea tall.

09:32.675 --> 09:34.208
Made out of metal.

09:34.210 --> 09:36.076
No?

09:44.619 --> 09:48.222
You're alive.

09:48.224 --> 09:51.825
Um, hi. How did I get here?

09:51.827 --> 09:54.695
I found you lying at
the bottom of a crater

09:54.697 --> 09:58.399
like you had been dropped from the sky.

09:58.401 --> 10:01.001
Dropped from the sky?

10:01.003 --> 10:03.570
That's the craziest
thing I've ever heard.

10:03.572 --> 10:06.507
Yeah, I sailed here,

10:06.509 --> 10:08.509
you know, across the ocean

10:08.511 --> 10:09.977
with some friends.

10:09.979 --> 10:13.247
Who hopefully are gonna find me.

10:13.249 --> 10:14.815
By the looks of it, I'm gonna say

10:14.817 --> 10:17.117
we're on the island of...

10:17.119 --> 10:20.854
Honshu, in the vicinity of Kyoto?

10:20.856 --> 10:23.090
Yes.

10:23.092 --> 10:25.292
How did you learn to speak my language?

10:25.294 --> 10:28.762
I studied it for many years.

10:28.764 --> 10:32.733
You know, so I could trade
with your countrymen.

10:32.735 --> 10:36.236
Yep, feudal Japan is my jam.

10:39.775 --> 10:41.809
Masako,

10:41.811 --> 10:43.610
what are you doing

10:43.612 --> 10:45.546
talking to this <i>gaijin?</i>

10:45.548 --> 10:47.348
He was hurt, Father.

10:47.350 --> 10:49.516
I brought him home so
you could care for him.

10:49.518 --> 10:52.653
And who would care for us
when the Shogun finds out

10:52.655 --> 10:56.123
- we're aiding a foreigner?
- Please, Father.

10:56.125 --> 10:58.125
You know what they would do to him.

11:01.897 --> 11:03.864
Very well.

11:03.866 --> 11:06.867
Get him inside quickly.

11:09.637 --> 11:12.272
My name is Nate, by the way.

11:12.274 --> 11:16.443
- My name is Masako.
- Masako.

11:16.445 --> 11:19.480
That's a pretty name.

11:29.325 --> 11:31.859
The Shogun asked you a question.

11:31.861 --> 11:34.728
Where did you find your armor?

11:34.730 --> 11:36.897
I made it.

11:46.675 --> 11:48.475
Your armor is mine now.

11:48.477 --> 11:51.845
You don't understand.

11:51.847 --> 11:55.616
I designed the suit
specifically for my body.

11:55.618 --> 11:57.985
Take the armor away.

11:59.755 --> 12:01.989
You're making a big mistake.

12:01.991 --> 12:03.490
It could kill you!

12:05.660 --> 12:07.761
Too hot?

12:07.763 --> 12:10.798
Are you, um, sure your old man's cool

12:10.800 --> 12:13.600
with you giving me a bath?

12:13.602 --> 12:16.737
- Mm.
- My father is not home.

12:18.540 --> 12:19.807
I'm only giving you a bath

12:19.809 --> 12:21.842
because you are dirty and injured.

12:21.844 --> 12:23.143
About that. I'm, uh...

12:23.145 --> 12:26.513
I'm more durable than it looks.

12:26.515 --> 12:28.949
You still have not told
where you are from.

12:28.951 --> 12:31.718
The United States,

12:31.720 --> 12:33.220
which you've never heard of

12:33.222 --> 12:36.523
because it doesn't exist
for another 200 years.

12:36.525 --> 12:38.025
You are a strange man.

12:38.027 --> 12:41.328
You have no idea.

12:41.330 --> 12:42.429
Enough about me,

12:42.431 --> 12:45.899
I overheard your father
talk about the Shogun.

12:45.901 --> 12:48.535
Is that Tokugawa lemitsu, by any chance?

12:48.537 --> 12:53.140
Historians view him as a
particularly brutal warlord

12:53.142 --> 12:55.642
and...

12:58.881 --> 13:01.381
Did I say something?

13:03.017 --> 13:06.820
Tomorrow I'm to be married
to Tokugawa lemitsu.

13:06.822 --> 13:10.290
Then my life is over.

13:15.431 --> 13:18.132
How can you bring a thug
on a rescue mission?

13:18.134 --> 13:20.033
I've known men like you.

13:20.035 --> 13:21.568
Men who take and prey on the weak.

13:21.570 --> 13:22.936
Listen, girly,

13:22.938 --> 13:24.972
I'm risking my neck for two morons

13:24.974 --> 13:26.874
who fell out of a ship. Why?

13:26.876 --> 13:28.442
'Cause they'd do the same for me.

13:28.444 --> 13:30.210
Why are you on the ship?

13:30.212 --> 13:32.312
'Cause I'm a member of the
Justice Society of America.

13:32.314 --> 13:35.048
- It's my job to protect everyone.
- Except for me.

13:35.050 --> 13:38.352
You snuck up behind me and
sliced my throat like a ninja.

13:38.354 --> 13:40.354
There's no such thing
as ninjas, you idiot.

13:40.356 --> 13:42.289
- Tell that to Chuck Norris.
- Who's that?

13:42.291 --> 13:43.590
- And I'm the idiot.
- And by the way,

13:43.592 --> 13:45.125
- I'm not your girly.
- All right,

13:45.127 --> 13:46.493
if you two don't quit your squabbling,

13:46.495 --> 13:47.728
I am going to maroon you

13:47.730 --> 13:50.097
in a time period of my choosing.

13:50.099 --> 13:52.966
Together.

14:00.543 --> 14:02.609
Not to brag, but...

14:02.611 --> 14:04.077
Between the
docking stabilizers

14:04.079 --> 14:05.179
and the blast doors,

14:05.181 --> 14:07.114
I think this might be
my best patchwork ever.

14:07.116 --> 14:08.682
Well, charming as your confidence is,

14:08.684 --> 14:10.284
I think we better consult the expert.

14:10.286 --> 14:14.087
Gideon, would you be so kind
as to run a diagnostic report?

14:14.089 --> 14:16.390
<i>Mr. Jackson's work has done the trick.</i>

14:16.392 --> 14:17.591
<i>A scan has revealed that</i>

14:17.593 --> 14:19.393
<i>all 36 compartments of the ship</i>

14:19.395 --> 14:21.295
<i>are in optimal condition.</i>

14:21.297 --> 14:22.863
That's weird.

14:22.865 --> 14:24.798
Actually, I think it's astonishing given

14:24.800 --> 14:26.533
the considerable abuse
we've been under...

14:26.535 --> 14:28.769
No, no, not... not that.

14:28.771 --> 14:31.939
Gideon, did you say 36 compartments?

14:31.941 --> 14:34.875
<i>Correct. The entirety of the ship.</i>

14:34.877 --> 14:37.978
Before Rip, you know, disappeared,

14:37.980 --> 14:40.480
he made me learn every
inch of the Waverider,

14:40.482 --> 14:42.216
and of those inches,

14:42.218 --> 14:44.484
35 compartments.

14:44.486 --> 14:46.119
So either I miscalculated or...

14:46.121 --> 14:48.789
Captain Hunter had a secret compartment

14:48.791 --> 14:50.857
he failed to tell you about.

14:50.859 --> 14:53.560
Gideon, please pull up the
schematics of the ship.

14:53.562 --> 14:56.129
No, we still have to fix the time drive.

14:56.131 --> 14:57.965
And we will.

14:57.967 --> 15:00.801
After.

15:00.803 --> 15:04.037
Please, don't tell me
you're not intrigued.

15:04.039 --> 15:06.039
Masako, <i>san,</i>

15:06.041 --> 15:07.174
a word please.

15:07.176 --> 15:09.576
What's wrong?

15:09.578 --> 15:11.245
The Shogun's men are here.

15:11.247 --> 15:13.180
Please come outside.

15:25.293 --> 15:28.028
<i>Konnichiwa.</i> How can I help you?

15:28.030 --> 15:30.897
We found a <i>gaijin</i> in the forest.

15:30.899 --> 15:32.332
The Shogun wants to make sure

15:32.334 --> 15:34.601
there are not any other
foreigners around

15:34.603 --> 15:38.639
to bother you. Oh, that
is very kind of him,

15:38.641 --> 15:40.941
but you are the only
visitor we've had today.

15:40.943 --> 15:42.576
Good.

15:42.578 --> 15:44.444
The last thing the Shogun wants

15:44.446 --> 15:46.847
before his wedding is surprises.

15:46.849 --> 15:50.317
Too late!

15:50.319 --> 15:51.418
What are you doing?

15:51.420 --> 15:53.120
Relax, I got this.

15:53.122 --> 15:55.689
- Who are you?
- I'm the guy telling you

15:55.691 --> 15:57.991
that your Shogun's wedding
has been canceled

15:57.993 --> 16:00.260
on account that he's an asshat.

16:04.600 --> 16:06.133
But seriously.

16:06.135 --> 16:09.336
Why don't you boys mosey on
back to your big bad boss

16:09.338 --> 16:11.171
and tell him the news?

16:11.173 --> 16:13.774
Or what?

16:13.776 --> 16:15.309
Or it's gonna get ugly.

16:15.311 --> 16:18.111
I am wearing a Samurai's armor.

16:18.113 --> 16:19.446
You are not.

16:19.448 --> 16:21.815
I wear my armor on the inside.

16:21.817 --> 16:25.319
Nate, stop insulting him. I beg of you.

16:25.321 --> 16:28.355
Relax, I got this.

16:33.562 --> 16:34.928
He caught me off guard.

16:34.930 --> 16:36.797
Ah, he caught me off guard.

16:36.799 --> 16:38.832
He caught me off guard.

16:42.371 --> 16:43.737
Come at me now.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.707
It's not turning on.

16:46.709 --> 16:48.742
Stop! Stop! Please!

16:48.744 --> 16:50.077
You're going to kill him.

16:50.079 --> 16:53.513
That is entirely up to him.

16:53.515 --> 16:55.315
Stay down, <i>gaijin.</i>

16:55.317 --> 16:57.284
She doesn't want to marry him.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.662
We will return tomorrow to
take you to the castle.

17:08.664 --> 17:11.598
I trust there will be no more...

17:11.599 --> 17:13.467
surprises.

17:28.016 --> 17:31.317
The sword did not cut any vital organs

17:31.319 --> 17:33.119
but the blood loss...

17:33.121 --> 17:35.154
Tell me about it.

17:35.156 --> 17:36.823
What were you thinking?

17:36.825 --> 17:39.158
I didn't mean to cause
you any more trouble.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.427
I was just trying to help.

17:41.429 --> 17:44.130
No one can help me.

17:44.132 --> 17:46.699
We have that in common.

17:46.701 --> 17:49.602
Nate? Nate!

17:49.604 --> 17:53.339
The Signal from Ray's ATOM
suit is getting stronger.

17:53.341 --> 17:55.408
Doesn't exactly look inviting, does it?

17:55.410 --> 17:58.077
The Domination."

17:58.079 --> 17:59.612
Never took you for a cinephile.

17:59.614 --> 18:02.648
All I know is ninjas
like to hide in trees.

18:02.650 --> 18:05.852
- I don't see anything.
- Exactly.

18:05.854 --> 18:08.020
You don't find them, they find you.

18:08.022 --> 18:10.089
Just because you saw ninjas in a movie,

18:10.091 --> 18:11.891
that doesn't make them real.

18:11.893 --> 18:13.593
I have to side with Mick on this one.

18:13.595 --> 18:15.128
They're real.

18:15.130 --> 18:16.829
You think there's a
secret brotherhood of men

18:16.831 --> 18:18.765
trained in the art of assassination?

18:18.767 --> 18:20.099
I hate to break it to you, Amaya,

18:20.101 --> 18:22.435
but I'm basically a ninja.

18:25.507 --> 18:28.808
I miss the JSA.

18:28.810 --> 18:31.911
Compartment 36 should
be right about here.

18:33.013 --> 18:34.347
What are you doing, Grey?

18:34.349 --> 18:36.048
I'm looking for any hidden doors.

18:36.050 --> 18:37.784
We don't
have time for this.

18:37.786 --> 18:40.019
Nate and Ray are lost in Feudal Japan.

18:40.021 --> 18:42.555
Let's just fix the ship and go.

18:44.459 --> 18:47.360
Shh, did you hear that, Jefferson?

18:47.362 --> 18:49.228
Move.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.506
- Oh my god.
- Secret hatch.

19:00.508 --> 19:02.208
With a sequencing lock.

19:02.210 --> 19:05.511
Clearly, Captain Hunter didn't
want anyone getting in.

19:05.513 --> 19:08.848
Or maybe he was trying to keep
something from getting out.

19:08.850 --> 19:10.950
If I've learned one thing from "Lost,"

19:10.952 --> 19:13.719
it's you don't go
opening secret hatches.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.358
Ray's close. Look sharp.

19:24.365 --> 19:26.799
Haircut, let's get out of here.

19:26.801 --> 19:29.469
We're saving your ass, again.

19:30.938 --> 19:34.140
It is you who need rescuing.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.915
Fellas, getting a little cold
in here without my suit.

19:52.493 --> 19:56.095
You are already defeated
before you have even begun.

19:56.097 --> 19:59.932
I have been trained in the art
of war by Shimura himself.

19:59.934 --> 20:03.903
League of Assassins, class of '09.

20:03.905 --> 20:05.905
Don't take it easy on me.

20:39.773 --> 20:42.275
We got to go.

20:46.914 --> 20:48.481
Oh, hey, guys!

20:48.483 --> 20:51.918
- Wrong way, Haircut.
- What about my suit?

20:55.356 --> 20:57.890
We can get it later.

21:09.016 --> 21:11.450
My friend's serum,

21:11.452 --> 21:14.620
it's cured my hemophilia.

21:14.622 --> 21:17.122
Uh, long story.

21:17.124 --> 21:18.424
Short version,

21:18.426 --> 21:21.060
my blood didn't clot like normal people,

21:21.062 --> 21:23.395
so if I were to cut myself shaving

21:23.397 --> 21:24.463
or get a paper cut,

21:24.465 --> 21:27.599
I could... die.

21:28.696 --> 21:32.265
So every day, you were afraid to live?

21:32.267 --> 21:34.367
Pretty much.

21:37.104 --> 21:39.005
In the Samurai tradition,

21:39.007 --> 21:42.141
a warrior is always prepared for death.

21:42.143 --> 21:45.645
A woman celebrates when her
husband dies with honor.

21:46.748 --> 21:49.982
Wow. That's hardcore.

21:49.984 --> 21:53.953
A Samurai who fights without armor,

21:53.955 --> 21:56.856
that is hardcore.

22:01.528 --> 22:04.030
Nate, you're alive.

22:04.032 --> 22:05.798
Oh, hey, guys! You found me.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.000
- Bad timing?
- Nope.

22:08.002 --> 22:09.835
Nope.

22:09.837 --> 22:11.837
Masako, these are,

22:11.839 --> 22:14.607
uh, my friends I was telling you about.

22:14.609 --> 22:16.242
<i>Hajimemashite.</i>

22:16.244 --> 22:17.643
Can I get you something to drink?

22:17.645 --> 22:19.212
Sake, lots of it.

22:19.214 --> 22:21.681
What he meant to say is
thanks for your hospitality,

22:21.683 --> 22:23.149
but we must be going.

22:23.151 --> 22:24.884
- No, I didn't.
- Amaya's right.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.385
Nate, let's go.

22:26.387 --> 22:29.188
I can't.

22:29.190 --> 22:31.224
We can't leave.

22:31.226 --> 22:34.594
Masako's supposed to marry
the Shogun Tokugawa lemitsu.

22:34.596 --> 22:36.162
Yeah, met him. Not a fan.

22:36.164 --> 22:38.231
Well, the reason he sticks
out in the history books is

22:38.233 --> 22:39.932
because he likes to murder his wives,

22:39.934 --> 22:41.968
and I can't leave Masako to his mercy.

22:41.970 --> 22:44.036
Especially since he stole my ATOM suit.

22:44.038 --> 22:45.938
Exactly. Wait, what?

22:45.940 --> 22:48.341
You let the Shogun steal a
21st century super-suit?

22:48.343 --> 22:51.077
After I crash-landed
trying to rescue you.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.980
How does the Shogun even know
how to operate your ATOM suit?

22:53.982 --> 22:56.215
I designed it so an idiot could use it.

22:56.217 --> 22:57.984
An idiot does.

22:57.986 --> 23:01.020
Guys, bottom line is, if the
Shogun has the ATOM suit,

23:01.022 --> 23:03.456
it's not just Masako and the
village we have to protect.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.324
He can use it to conquer
the whole region.

23:05.326 --> 23:08.127
You said the Shogun's coming
for your new girlfriend.

23:08.129 --> 23:09.895
- Uh-huh.
- Easier to defend a village

23:09.897 --> 23:11.964
- than to attack a castle.
- But anyone who tries

23:11.966 --> 23:13.799
to fight the Shogun will be cut down.

23:13.801 --> 23:16.335
Except if that person

23:16.337 --> 23:19.071
- is made of steel.
- About that,

23:19.073 --> 23:22.375
I'm having a little problem
accessing my powers.

23:22.377 --> 23:24.877
Sounds like you're having
performance issues,

23:24.879 --> 23:27.179
and it looks like you're
not done training him yet.

23:27.181 --> 23:29.015
Now the rest of us need to figure out

23:29.017 --> 23:31.250
how we can defend a village.

23:31.252 --> 23:32.551
Not me.

23:32.553 --> 23:34.553
Wake me up when the action starts.

23:47.034 --> 23:50.136
Whoa, what is this place?

23:50.138 --> 23:53.139
It appears to be some sort of armory.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.541
There's a reason why Rip
didn't want us in here.

23:55.543 --> 23:57.710
Some things you can't un-see.

23:57.712 --> 23:59.812
But why the big secret?

23:59.814 --> 24:01.147
Rip didn't trust us to know that

24:01.149 --> 24:03.449
there were heavy-duty weapons on board?

24:03.451 --> 24:06.118
Well, would you?

24:09.323 --> 24:13.125
Look, Jefferson,

24:13.127 --> 24:17.463
our old friend has hailed the Waverider.

24:17.465 --> 24:20.166
Let's play it.

24:20.168 --> 24:23.002
<i>Sorry to contact you like
this, Captain Hunter.</i>

24:23.004 --> 24:24.970
<i>But I can't risk putting
any more lives in danger.</i>

24:24.972 --> 24:26.205
Thought this was from Barry Allen?

24:26.207 --> 24:27.206
It is.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.641
Only from 40 years in the future.

24:28.643 --> 24:30.543
- And neither can this.
- Fascinating.

24:30.545 --> 24:33.412
<i>Which is why you'll keep what
I'm about to tell you a secret.</i>

24:33.414 --> 24:36.749
<i>Even from the rest of your team.</i>

24:38.285 --> 24:41.454
The ATOM suit is made of and
powered by dwarf star alloy.

24:41.456 --> 24:45.291
It's strong enough to withstand
bullets, arrows, and explosives.

24:45.293 --> 24:48.561
- So it's impenetrable?
- Not quite.

24:48.563 --> 24:51.163
Underneath the left thruster
is the alpha-stabilizer.

24:51.165 --> 24:54.200
- Alpha-stabilizer, got it.
- If you destroy it,

24:54.202 --> 24:56.802
the photons that stream
from suit's weapons systems

24:56.804 --> 24:58.304
will overheat,

24:58.306 --> 25:00.773
theoretically causing somatic overload.

25:00.775 --> 25:03.275
Theoretically, that's...
that's comforting.

25:03.277 --> 25:05.177
You have to get close to the Shogun,

25:05.179 --> 25:07.213
and in order to do that, you
have to be able to harden.

25:07.215 --> 25:10.616
Well, when you're putting it in
those terms it isn't helping.

25:10.618 --> 25:12.051
Ow! Neither is that.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.819
It worked the last time.

25:13.821 --> 25:15.154
Ow.

25:15.156 --> 25:17.890
Come on. My serum is flawless.

25:17.892 --> 25:19.658
Your lack of focus is the problem.

25:19.660 --> 25:21.227
You think I'm not focusing?

25:21.229 --> 25:23.129
Like... enough!

25:23.131 --> 25:25.064
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can.

25:25.066 --> 25:26.632
You don't think I don't
want to save the girl,

25:26.634 --> 25:29.935
spare the village, and be a
hero for once in my damn life?

25:29.937 --> 25:32.405
I spent half of my
childhood in the hospital

25:32.407 --> 25:33.706
where it didn't even occur to me

25:33.708 --> 25:35.341
to dream about having superpowers.

25:35.343 --> 25:38.277
But guess what? I got 'em, I lost 'em,

25:38.279 --> 25:40.780
now I really, really need 'em,
and I can't get 'em back.

25:40.782 --> 25:43.249
This isn't all about you.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.584
I worked for years, spent
billions of dollars

25:45.586 --> 25:47.052
to develop the ATOM suit.

25:47.054 --> 25:49.188
I nearly died learning to shrink,

25:49.190 --> 25:53.159
and now, I have to teach you
to destroy the very thing,

25:53.161 --> 25:57.196
the only thing, that makes me a hero.

25:57.198 --> 25:58.964
Wait?

25:58.966 --> 26:01.667
"Somatic overload" means
destroy the suit?

26:01.669 --> 26:05.371
Yeah, Nate.

26:05.373 --> 26:08.107
We can't beat the Shogun
while he's wearing the suit,

26:08.109 --> 26:10.309
so we have to blow the suit up.

26:12.313 --> 26:14.780
Your powers are within you.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.749
After today,

26:16.751 --> 26:20.319
I'll have nothing left.

26:20.321 --> 26:22.421
Ray...

26:34.334 --> 26:37.169
You should all be safe here.

26:42.909 --> 26:45.444
They've never seen foreigners before.

26:45.446 --> 26:46.779
I was once just like them.

26:46.781 --> 26:49.648
My village was also small and isolated.

26:49.650 --> 26:52.351
Some would say that my
people were superstitious,

26:52.353 --> 26:54.320
but in truth,

26:54.322 --> 26:55.754
we were protected.

26:55.756 --> 26:59.358
Protected by that?

26:59.360 --> 27:01.961
Legend has it that this
totem was one of five

27:01.963 --> 27:03.295
created by the gods

27:03.297 --> 27:06.932
and given to the five
great tribes of Zambesi.

27:06.934 --> 27:09.001
This totem harnesses the ashe,

27:09.003 --> 27:10.703
or the... the life force,

27:10.705 --> 27:12.705
of the animal kingdom.

27:12.707 --> 27:14.507
It was passed down to me from my mother

27:14.509 --> 27:16.642
and from hers before that.

27:16.644 --> 27:18.944
And why did you leave?

27:18.946 --> 27:21.547
I was recruited by the JSA,

27:21.549 --> 27:23.282
and I realized that

27:23.284 --> 27:26.118
the world was much larger
than just my village,

27:26.120 --> 27:28.487
and that there were
people beyond its borders

27:28.489 --> 27:31.156
who also needed protection.

27:31.158 --> 27:34.460
Sometimes I can't help but worry

27:34.462 --> 27:36.462
that with me gone,

27:36.464 --> 27:39.999
there's no one left to guard my home.

27:40.001 --> 27:42.601
From people like Mr. Rory.

27:42.603 --> 27:44.003
At the end of the day,

27:44.005 --> 27:47.072
Mick does the right thing.

27:47.074 --> 27:48.874
Usually.

27:56.717 --> 28:00.586
You remind me of my son.

28:00.588 --> 28:01.954
Why?

28:01.956 --> 28:03.989
Was he a terrible teacher, too?

28:06.516 --> 28:10.618
He was a great Samurai.

28:12.823 --> 28:17.727
I built him the strongest
and most formidable armor

28:17.729 --> 28:19.862
in all of Japan.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.131
Forged him a sword

28:22.133 --> 28:25.401
fit for an Emperor.

28:25.403 --> 28:28.504
What happened to him?

28:28.506 --> 28:31.708
My son was popular

28:31.710 --> 28:35.211
with the men who served under him,

28:35.213 --> 28:38.181
and the Shogun resented him for it.

28:38.183 --> 28:41.050
So he ordered Oda

28:41.052 --> 28:43.453
to commit <i>seppuku.</i>

28:43.455 --> 28:45.755
We will make sure that the Shogun pays

28:45.757 --> 28:48.057
for what he's done to your family.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.959
Maybe.

28:49.961 --> 28:51.961
Maybe not.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.696
But I ask you,

28:53.698 --> 28:57.267
would I rather hold my son again

28:57.269 --> 29:00.303
or his armor?

29:00.305 --> 29:02.105
Your son, obviously.

29:02.107 --> 29:06.175
An armor is nothing but
iron, leather, and silk.

29:06.177 --> 29:08.211
It can be replaced,

29:08.213 --> 29:10.980
but the man

29:10.982 --> 29:13.750
who wears the armor is...

29:13.752 --> 29:15.451
I get it.

29:15.453 --> 29:17.053
You're saying I don't
need a suit of armor

29:17.055 --> 29:18.388
to defeat the Shogun.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.490
Don't be ridiculous.

29:20.492 --> 29:24.127
He'll kill you in seconds.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.062
Follow me.

29:28.532 --> 29:30.266
I'm gonna die.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.535
Yeah, probably.

29:32.537 --> 29:35.705
That was actually your
cue to cheer me up.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.407
Oh, if you accept death

29:37.409 --> 29:40.076
you have nothing to fear.

29:40.078 --> 29:43.746
I'm more afraid of what's
gonna happen to you if I die.

29:44.915 --> 29:47.917
I know I have these powers inside me.

29:47.919 --> 29:50.286
I just can't figure out how to use them.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.355
Does a child learn to laugh?

29:52.357 --> 29:55.158
Does he sit and practice laughing?

29:55.160 --> 29:56.392
No.

29:56.394 --> 29:58.099
He just laughs.

29:58.124 --> 29:59.656
Hmm.

29:59.864 --> 30:03.132
"Do or do not, there is no try."

30:03.134 --> 30:04.467
Exactly.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.969
Where did you learn that?

30:06.971 --> 30:10.540
From a great sensei

30:10.542 --> 30:12.709
from where I'm from.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.544
Yoda.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.914
Ah, this Master Yoda is very wise.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.620
The Shogun approaches.

30:24.622 --> 30:26.589
Get to the temple.

30:54.719 --> 30:56.586
Where is my bride?

30:56.587 --> 30:58.569
She's not leaving.

30:58.695 --> 31:00.195
Not with you.

31:07.303 --> 31:10.805
I'm just gonna need a second.

31:21.154 --> 31:22.662
_

31:22.687 --> 31:24.146
_

31:29.593 --> 31:33.194
Find the villagers. Kill them.

31:39.136 --> 31:41.569
Your form is all wrong.

31:49.316 --> 31:51.851
I ordered Ichiro to destroy that blade

31:51.853 --> 31:54.589
after the death of his son.

31:54.683 --> 31:56.783
Very well.

31:56.786 --> 32:00.421
I will destroy it myself.

32:03.987 --> 32:06.921
<i>Konnichiwa,</i> scumbag.

32:08.324 --> 32:11.692
Go get him.

32:14.196 --> 32:16.129
I will kill you

32:16.131 --> 32:19.633
with your own armor.

32:21.170 --> 32:23.705
Check the temple.

32:23.706 --> 32:25.739
Rematch?

32:27.909 --> 32:30.978
- Who is your master?
- I have no master.

32:30.981 --> 32:34.415
A ronin. You're not
worthy of the effort.

32:57.039 --> 33:00.318
You have fought with honor.

33:00.343 --> 33:02.176
Now you will die with it.

33:02.411 --> 33:04.111
About that.

33:13.755 --> 33:15.522
This village is under our protection.

33:15.524 --> 33:18.458
Leave now and we'll spare your lives.

33:38.780 --> 33:42.749
A sword is only as deadly
as the man who wields it.

33:52.193 --> 33:54.828
And armor is only as strong
as the man who wears it.

34:17.619 --> 34:19.252
I don't want to shoot you guys.

34:19.254 --> 34:21.154
I love ninjas.

34:45.714 --> 34:47.114
That was the armature relay.

34:47.116 --> 34:49.349
It enhances the limbs' reaction time.

35:07.402 --> 35:08.802
Where the hell is Mick?

35:08.804 --> 35:11.471
Probably ransacking the village himself.

35:19.714 --> 35:22.282
Told you ninjas were real.

35:24.452 --> 35:25.719
That's the cooling system.

35:25.721 --> 35:27.387
Trust me, it gets hot in there. I know.

35:27.389 --> 35:29.289
You think you are clever.

35:40.234 --> 35:43.870
You dishonor my family
and torture my village.

35:43.872 --> 35:46.473
I will enjoy killing you.

35:52.914 --> 35:56.183
Your family will be
extinguished from history.

36:02.491 --> 36:04.224
We haven't been introduced.

36:04.226 --> 36:06.126
Name's Steel.

36:30.918 --> 36:33.019
- Remember, you got to hit...
- I remember!

36:41.430 --> 36:43.363
Do it!

37:02.517 --> 37:05.585
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

37:05.587 --> 37:08.889
You did it. I did it.

37:08.891 --> 37:10.724
Yeah...

37:10.726 --> 37:12.592
you blew up the ATOM suit.

37:19.001 --> 37:22.135
I am so sorry.

37:22.137 --> 37:24.171
It's okay.

37:24.173 --> 37:26.339
You steeled on.

37:26.341 --> 37:29.242
Kind of proud of you.

37:40.474 --> 37:42.509
Master Yoda taught you well.

37:43.912 --> 37:46.980
Right, uh, Yoda. Well, thank you.

37:46.982 --> 37:48.882
Um...

37:48.884 --> 37:51.117
I was thinking now that,

37:51.119 --> 37:53.620
uh, your wedding is canceled...

37:57.225 --> 38:00.059
You come from the sky.

38:00.061 --> 38:03.430
Something tells me you have to return.

38:10.871 --> 38:13.106
I, um...

38:13.108 --> 38:16.643
I'm glad the katana sword
found a worthy owner.

38:16.645 --> 38:18.578
Me too.

38:20.848 --> 38:22.882
You.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.052
Don't think I didn't see how
you stood up to the Shogun.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.220
Even though he's gone,

38:27.222 --> 38:30.056
your village still needs a protector.

38:33.928 --> 38:36.162
That sword,

38:36.164 --> 38:38.965
what did you say your family name was?

38:38.967 --> 38:40.366
Yamashiro.

38:45.105 --> 38:48.508
Thank you for loaning
me your son's armor.

38:48.510 --> 38:51.845
I'm sorry it got a bit
dinged up in the battle.

38:51.847 --> 38:54.814
Then it served its purpose.

38:54.816 --> 38:57.016
Haircut. Steel.

38:57.018 --> 39:01.020
Sara says we got to clear out.

39:01.022 --> 39:04.457
- Good-bye, Masako.
- Good-bye, Nate.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.662
What an amazing time period.

39:09.664 --> 39:12.999
Definitely my favorite,
besides the Old West.

39:13.001 --> 39:15.602
Why are you two goofy bastards so happy?

39:15.604 --> 39:17.937
You lost your damn suit, the food sucks,

39:17.939 --> 39:21.407
and I've got no proof ninjas exist.

39:35.589 --> 39:37.223
What are you staring at?

39:37.225 --> 39:39.125
I've figured you out.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.160
Congratulations.

39:41.162 --> 39:44.531
You act like this selfish meathead,

39:44.533 --> 39:48.101
but secretly, you're not so bad.

39:48.103 --> 39:51.237
You know, you might even
have the makings of a hero.

39:51.239 --> 39:53.907
Well, that proves one thing.

39:53.909 --> 39:56.943
You don't know me.

39:56.945 --> 39:59.045
Perhaps not.

40:00.948 --> 40:02.749
Trying to kill me again?

40:02.751 --> 40:04.484
Trying to give you a present.

40:04.486 --> 40:08.087
In case you ever need proof
you met an actual ninja.

40:22.603 --> 40:25.905
All right. What's your secret?

40:27.374 --> 40:28.608
What on earth do you mean?

40:28.610 --> 40:30.410
Well, you two must be magicians

40:30.412 --> 40:32.512
considering how badly
damaged the Waverider was

40:32.514 --> 40:34.581
- before we left.
- Oh, that.

40:34.583 --> 40:37.917
Well, Jefferson and I went
over the ship top to bottom.

40:37.919 --> 40:41.654
And safe to say there are no
surprises left on the Waverider.

40:43.190 --> 40:46.192
Great. I'll go prep for takeoff.

40:50.297 --> 40:51.998
So are we gonna say something

40:52.000 --> 40:53.700
about future-Barry's message or not?

40:53.702 --> 40:55.101
Barry was very clear

40:55.103 --> 40:57.136
about the team not knowing
what he told Captain Hunter.

40:57.138 --> 40:59.839
Except now we know.

40:59.841 --> 41:01.708
Indeed.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.876
You were right, Jefferson.

41:03.878 --> 41:07.680
Some things you just can't un-see.

41:11.853 --> 41:14.220
I think it's time we said sayonara

41:14.222 --> 41:16.789
to Feudal Japan. Now, where to next?

41:16.791 --> 41:20.426
I could always open the hatch,
jump out, and see where I land.

41:20.428 --> 41:22.962
I say we just sit back and see
where the timestream takes us.

41:22.964 --> 41:25.798
Aren't you forgetting that Rex's
killer is still at-large?

41:25.800 --> 41:29.302
Not my problem.

41:29.304 --> 41:32.338
I mean, we should find the
bastard and kill him.

41:32.340 --> 41:35.375
Perhaps we can enjoy a
little takeoff music.

41:36.845 --> 41:38.778
Ah, nice one, Gideon.

41:38.780 --> 41:42.181
<i>Captain Hunter always enjoyed this song.</i>

41:42.183 --> 41:44.384
<i>- ♪ Time...</i>
- Speaking of problems.

41:44.386 --> 41:46.152
Don't worry. We're gonna find Rip

41:46.154 --> 41:47.587
and Hourman's killer.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.789
In the meantime, everyone just shut up

41:49.791 --> 41:51.591
and let me do the flying.
