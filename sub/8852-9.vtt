Comes.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.231
Ooh.

00:29.356 --> 00:30.238
Thank you.

00:30.404 --> 00:31.698
Thank you so fucking much.

00:31.864 --> 00:33.902
I put my name in for seven songs,

00:34.027 --> 00:35.285
so I'll be back up here again.

00:35.451 --> 00:37.704
- Uh, yes.
- Wow.

00:37.870 --> 00:40.207
- Instant classic.
- Wow.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.247
- That was really scary.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:45.372 --> 00:46.588
I was very scared there for a minute.

00:46.754 --> 00:49.383
Honestly, you're like a crazy person.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.519
Okay, I'm not crazy.

00:50.644 --> 00:52.054
It's just been a crazy week, Anders.

00:52.179 --> 00:53.322
Okay?

00:53.447 --> 00:54.323
Okay.

00:54.448 --> 00:55.555
Brent Hoffman died.

00:55.721 --> 00:57.808
Who's Brent Hoffman?

00:57.974 --> 00:59.226
He was my favorite cat.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.977
You... you had to put him down, huh?

01:01.143 --> 01:02.297
Uh, no, no.

01:02.422 --> 01:05.066
He was eaten by two of my other cats.

01:05.191 --> 01:06.316
Really hard to watch.

01:20.788 --> 01:22.417
Hey, I really appreciate you guys

01:22.542 --> 01:24.543
coming to one
of my sing-alongs finally.

01:24.709 --> 01:25.654
- Yeah.
- It's fun.

01:25.779 --> 01:26.837
And as a "thank you,"

01:27.003 --> 01:28.490
I've got some extra tickets

01:28.615 --> 01:29.758
to the Rihanna concert this weekend.

01:29.883 --> 01:30.799
Do you guys wanna go?

01:30.965 --> 01:33.510
- Yeah.
- That sounds fun.

01:33.676 --> 01:35.497
Who is that, though?
Yeah, I'm excited, though.

01:35.622 --> 01:36.763
What do you mean, "who is that"?

01:36.929 --> 01:38.534
Rihanna. She's the queen
of R&B right now.

01:38.659 --> 01:40.369
She's got that accent
from the future,

01:40.494 --> 01:41.685
she's light-skinned, with the butt.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.839
Condom in the eye, <i>Waterfalls.</i>

01:43.964 --> 01:46.022
She's a classic. She's a cla...
She's still around.

01:46.188 --> 01:47.107
He has no idea.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.567
He knows.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.360
No, that's okay if you don't
know who Rihanna is, Adam.

01:50.526 --> 01:51.914
No, I know...
I want to go to the concert.

01:52.039 --> 01:53.415
- I know who she is.
- It'll be fun.

01:53.540 --> 01:54.650
I haven't seen a concert in forever.

01:54.775 --> 01:55.951
Last concert I went to

01:56.076 --> 01:57.909
was that Green Day cover band,
the Basket Cases.

01:58.075 --> 01:59.619
- Pretty talented.
- That was cool. We got high.

01:59.785 --> 02:00.622
I'm gonna go get some more Molsons.

02:00.747 --> 02:01.657
- You guys want one?
- Yes!

02:01.782 --> 02:02.706
I would love a Molsons.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.332
- More Molsons.
- Favorite beer.

02:04.498 --> 02:06.295
I'm gonna go sing
some Rihanna right now.

02:06.420 --> 02:08.211
That's how much I... I love her
and know who she is.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.503
- Right.
- Excited.

02:09.669 --> 02:10.839
Do... what do you think?

02:11.005 --> 02:13.936
<i>Poker Face.</i>
That's a hit of her's.

02:14.061 --> 02:15.385
One word or two words?

02:15.551 --> 02:17.272
- I don't know.
- Okay, well, you don't know.

02:17.397 --> 02:18.841
Obviously you're not fans.

02:18.966 --> 02:21.443
You're heating on me
'cause I'm supposedly not a fan.

02:21.568 --> 02:23.059
Not happening, chicken banger.

02:23.225 --> 02:25.061
Okay, I'm just
going for the book, so.

02:25.227 --> 02:27.182
Yeah, around here, after 7:30,

02:27.307 --> 02:28.815
it's Alice in Chains or nothin'.

02:28.981 --> 02:30.886
Oh, now, now.
What's your name, bud?

02:31.011 --> 02:31.987
Hey, I'm Blake.

02:32.112 --> 02:33.570
I'm a hard rocker too, so I get it.

02:33.736 --> 02:34.780
And I'm married, butt pirate.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.531
Hey.
Hang on, buddy.

02:36.697 --> 02:38.909
We're all friends, here.
No need for the name calling.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.036
- Fuck off, Eddie Bauer!
- You know what?

02:41.202 --> 02:42.764
- Whoa.
- I've got this.

02:42.889 --> 02:45.300
You can't talk
to my friends that way.

02:45.425 --> 02:46.792
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

02:46.958 --> 02:49.004
I bet I can pour
this beer on your head...

02:49.129 --> 02:50.045
Like that.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.540
Oh!

02:51.665 --> 02:53.340
Hey, come on, that's a...
That's a perfectly good Molson.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.175
Hey, shit-head!

02:55.341 --> 02:59.095
Try that again, and this is
gonna happen to your dick.

02:59.261 --> 03:00.649
Yeah, that's right.

03:00.774 --> 03:02.724
That's your ding-dong in two pieces!

03:02.890 --> 03:06.922
Oh, I want you to hit me
so bad right now!

03:07.047 --> 03:09.356
Just fucking hit me!

03:09.522 --> 03:11.274
- Get out of here, you pussy!
- Yes, ma'am. Here.

03:11.440 --> 03:13.528
Yes, "yes, ma'am."

03:13.653 --> 03:16.488
Now, get out of here... pussy.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.906
Here you go.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.135
You want to sing something, Adam?

03:20.260 --> 03:21.436
- No.
- No.

03:21.561 --> 03:22.905
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- It's okay.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.873
- Adam, come on.
- I feel stupid.

03:24.998 --> 03:26.041
No, we're gonna ge-
we'll dry you off.

03:26.166 --> 03:28.257
- I know, he's very dumb.
- I feel stupid!

03:28.382 --> 03:30.752
Let's go to the bathroom.
Come on.

03:30.918 --> 03:32.420
I would have DDT'd that dude,

03:32.586 --> 03:36.051
but I pulled my back
this morning... farting.

03:36.176 --> 03:37.676
I farted really hard.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.121
I don't know about fighting
anymore, you know?

03:39.246 --> 03:42.124
If you hit somebody,
and you kill them by accident,

03:42.249 --> 03:43.431
you're flying con air.

03:43.597 --> 03:44.426
You couldn't have fought that dude.

03:44.551 --> 03:45.934
You're guarding all the Molsons.

03:46.100 --> 03:47.394
I had to guard the Molsons.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.730
If Jillian wouldn't have been
such a fight hog,

03:48.855 --> 03:50.065
we would have scared that dude
something no-nonsense.

03:50.190 --> 03:51.314
He was intimidated.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.101
- What was that?
- He was intimidated at first.

03:53.226 --> 03:55.070
Guys, come on.
We got punked.

03:55.195 --> 03:57.039
And we got saved by a girl.

03:57.164 --> 03:58.573
We might as well cut our nuts off,

03:58.698 --> 04:00.208
and turn them in to the dude sheriff,

04:00.333 --> 04:02.784
'cause we don't deserve these
badges that we call testicles.

04:02.950 --> 04:04.479
We should just
give our balls to that guy.

04:04.604 --> 04:05.914
- Yeah.
- I mean, he's a man.

04:06.039 --> 04:08.039
He probably has three balls.

04:08.205 --> 04:09.318
He definitely had horrible B.O.

04:09.443 --> 04:11.084
I think that's a sign of giant balls.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.187
- Rank.
- Lucky.

04:12.312 --> 04:14.504
Testosterone stinks.
I smell like flowers.

04:14.670 --> 04:16.464
These hands of mine are so soft.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.995
It's like Chinese silk ribbon.
It's weird.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.397
They've never done anything
manly in my whole stupid life.

04:22.522 --> 04:23.471
Not one thing.

04:23.637 --> 04:25.000
I pet a llama once.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.474
That's the manliest thing
I've ever done.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.809
That was cool, though.

04:27.975 --> 04:29.004
We went to that petting zoo.
All those cute ducks.

04:29.129 --> 04:30.145
They were scary.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.206
Guys, this is what I'm talking about.

04:31.331 --> 04:32.607
We're going to petting zoos

04:32.732 --> 04:34.733
when we should be slitting
the throats of those animals.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.735
Yeah, we should
slit throats of animals.

04:36.901 --> 04:37.946
We should be hunting or, like,

04:38.071 --> 04:40.515
pulling marlins out
of the ocean or, like, doing...

04:40.640 --> 04:41.615
What do men do?

04:41.781 --> 04:43.852
- We should go camping.
- Yes.

04:43.977 --> 04:45.320
- At the Brianna concert.
- Yes.

04:45.445 --> 04:48.056
No, Rihanna is out.
We cannot go to...

04:48.181 --> 04:50.040
We cannot be seen
at a Rihanna concert, guys.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.750
No, I've got the perfect thermos.

04:51.916 --> 04:52.694
We gotta hunt!

04:52.819 --> 04:54.329
We have to go and kill something!

04:54.454 --> 04:55.964
Hopefully not an innocent something.

04:56.089 --> 04:57.399
I don't like killing
innocent animals.

04:57.524 --> 04:59.591
We'll pick on the animals
that obviously deserve it.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.885
First thing's first.
Let's go buy some guns.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.139
What do you mean that there's
a ten-day waiting period?

05:04.264 --> 05:05.388
That doesn't seem real.

05:05.554 --> 05:08.143
We have the right to bear guns.

05:08.268 --> 05:11.269
I know that's a fact.
That's one of the commandments.

05:11.435 --> 05:12.896
Dude, it's the law.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.683
If a man disrespects you in a bar

05:14.808 --> 05:16.118
and pours a beer on your head,

05:16.243 --> 05:18.172
you have the right to shoot that man.

05:18.484 --> 05:19.402
Shut up.

05:19.568 --> 05:21.112
God, gimme a gun!
Just gimme a gun, man!

05:21.278 --> 05:22.614
All right. All right.
So, we can't have guns.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.824
We just need weapons
that can kill things,

05:24.990 --> 05:25.894
and money is no object.

05:26.019 --> 05:27.035
I've got a credit card,
so let's make it happen.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.196
- Do you have one of these?
- Mm-hmm.

05:28.321 --> 05:29.329
It's pretty inten...
You should get one.

05:29.556 --> 05:31.733
29.99 APR.
Not bad.

05:31.858 --> 05:33.201
Plus, I get Dannon points.

05:33.326 --> 05:35.293
- Ooh.
- I'll be stackin' dairy, homie.

05:35.459 --> 05:36.571
Oh, mama!

05:36.696 --> 05:39.141
Dude, look at
the craftsmanship of this bow.

05:39.266 --> 05:40.674
The guy behind the counter,

05:40.840 --> 05:41.977
he said that this is the same one

05:42.102 --> 05:44.469
they used to light the torch
at the Lillehammer Olympics.

05:44.635 --> 05:45.781
Ooh, nice.

05:45.906 --> 05:47.549
- I think that was Muhammad Ali.
- My dad's gonna flip.

05:47.674 --> 05:48.984
But I'm not sweating it.

05:49.109 --> 05:51.353
'Cause this crossbow's
gonna shoot a bow so hard

05:51.478 --> 05:53.228
it's gonna explode a deer's head.

05:53.394 --> 05:54.256
Git 'er done.

05:54.381 --> 05:55.939
Yeah, git 'er "dune."

05:56.105 --> 05:57.292
Thank you for the vest, by the way.

05:57.417 --> 05:58.727
I feel like I'm in <i>SWAT.</i>

05:58.852 --> 06:01.596
Colin Farrell...
"Get at me! Get at me!"

06:01.721 --> 06:04.280
L.L. Cool J, "get at me!"

06:04.446 --> 06:07.492
And Ders, thank you
for charging this to the game.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.337
Oh, what?
<i>Whale Wars?</i>

06:09.462 --> 06:11.540
Just friggin' harpoon guns?

06:11.665 --> 06:13.175
I don't know how it works yet, but...

06:13.300 --> 06:14.666
- Yeah. That's not how.
- Yeah.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.778
Wait, so now you're on board to hunt?

06:16.903 --> 06:18.253
I thought you weren't
really down for it.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.448
Yeah.

06:19.573 --> 06:20.916
Yeah, but fish aren't animals.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.017
They're like the rodents of the sea.

06:22.142 --> 06:23.351
Actually, I wouldn't...

06:23.476 --> 06:24.386
I wouldn't mind if we just
cemented over the ocean.

06:24.511 --> 06:25.635
I hate fish.

06:25.801 --> 06:29.389
Speaking of oceans,
who wants to take a dip?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.099
Oh!

06:31.265 --> 06:33.476
- Yeah, now we're talking.
- Here we go. Get in. Get in.

06:33.642 --> 06:35.270
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid to swoop.

06:35.436 --> 06:37.022
I feel like such a man right now.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.357
Oh.

06:39.523 --> 06:40.335
Guys, you might wanna start small,

06:40.460 --> 06:41.603
- because I just put a piece in...
- Oh.

06:41.728 --> 06:43.611
- And I'm already buzzing.
- Whoo!

06:43.777 --> 06:46.197
Is that mint,
or is that just, like, coffee?

06:46.363 --> 06:48.324
I'm buzzing really hard
right now. That's good.

06:48.490 --> 06:51.119
Oh, my brain hurts a little.
I'm tingling.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.280
We should s'go right now.
S'go!

06:52.405 --> 06:54.414
- S'go!
- Yeah. Ooh.

06:57.249 --> 06:59.044
Yeah, baby!

06:59.210 --> 07:00.288
Oh, this song...

07:00.413 --> 07:02.124
- Actually sucks pretty bad.
- Very loud.

07:02.249 --> 07:04.924
Yeah, it's very intense.
This is what men listen to.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.528
Yeah!

07:06.653 --> 07:09.564
This is like Satan's lullaby.
It's brutal! It's masculine!

07:09.689 --> 07:10.565
Yeah.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.432
Who wants margs?

07:12.598 --> 07:13.808
- I would love a marg.
- I'll take a marg.

07:13.974 --> 07:15.437
Man marg.

07:15.562 --> 07:17.139
It's not strawberry,
I hope you don't mind.

07:17.264 --> 07:18.772
It's just traditional.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.308
That's cool. That's cool.
I'm okay with that.

07:20.433 --> 07:21.476
He also said, "rocks," but whatever.

07:21.601 --> 07:22.711
You know, men, they...

07:22.836 --> 07:23.945
Sometimes they don't
get what they want,

07:24.070 --> 07:25.347
and they deal with it.

07:25.472 --> 07:27.447
- They deal.
- 'Cause we're men.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.550
Who the heck
brought lettuce on this trip?

07:28.675 --> 07:30.658
Men don't eat lettuce!

07:30.824 --> 07:32.410
- I didn't pack lettuce.
- Men don't eat lettuce.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.996
But I will put some
Lawry's salt on these burgers.

07:35.162 --> 07:36.424
Lawry's.

07:36.549 --> 07:38.026
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I like that, man.

07:38.151 --> 07:39.227
- Yo, Blaze.
- Huh?

07:39.352 --> 07:41.002
You about ready
to take the wheel up here?

07:41.168 --> 07:43.254
- Learn the how-tos of drivin?
- Huh?

07:43.420 --> 07:46.216
I mean, you had your learner's
permit about seven years, bud.

07:46.382 --> 07:47.202
I'll just do that later.

07:47.327 --> 07:48.870
Hey, come on.
Changing subjects.

07:48.995 --> 07:53.556
Who wants some waffles and ice cream?

07:53.722 --> 07:54.609
Oh, I know I do.

07:54.734 --> 07:56.178
But I'll take my ice cream first,

07:56.303 --> 07:58.978
because real men eat dessert first.

07:59.144 --> 08:00.515
Dessert first!

08:00.640 --> 08:03.399
Dessert first!
Dessert first!

08:03.565 --> 08:07.313
Dessert first! Dessert first!
Dessert first! Dessert first!

08:12.912 --> 08:14.934
There's supposed to be
a forest preserve up here.

08:15.059 --> 08:17.069
Got to be pretty good hunting.
There's a bike path.

08:17.194 --> 08:18.957
I figure we can just
shoot shit right off that.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.039
You think a mountain lion

08:20.164 --> 08:20.959
would fit on the roof of the `Vo?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.341
Minus the head, of course,

08:22.466 --> 08:23.742
'cause I've already
exploded that off.

08:23.867 --> 08:25.797
- Right.
- <i>Gears of War</i> style.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.279
The `Vo can handle
anything you throw at it.

08:27.404 --> 08:28.480
Yeah.

08:28.605 --> 08:29.782
Just don't throw
anything at it, please.

08:29.907 --> 08:31.094
Wait.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.419
Ah, Ders, come on!
Dude, what're you doing?

08:33.544 --> 08:34.587
I'm not doing anything.

08:34.712 --> 08:35.849
You got... did you put gas in it?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.256
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:37.381 --> 08:38.557
The steering...
Everything just went out.

08:38.682 --> 08:40.061
- Just... it stopped.
- Oh, no.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.393
Should we go look at this thing?

08:41.518 --> 08:42.938
Yeah, let's do it.
Ders, here, take your Margarita.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.066
I want you to stay liquidated.
It's hot.

08:45.232 --> 08:47.986
Well, she looks damn good.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.335
Yeah.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.447
Well, you know, it might be
the non-American engine.

08:51.613 --> 08:53.439
They're a little weaker overseas.

08:53.564 --> 08:55.374
American muscle,
now, that's where it's at.

08:55.499 --> 08:56.442
- I want to agree with you...
- Yeah.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.344
Except this is Swedish-engineered,

08:58.469 --> 08:59.664
so you're kind of wrong.

08:59.830 --> 09:00.999
- Mm.
- Ooh.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.381
But I'll call AAA,

09:02.506 --> 09:03.501
see if they can tow her down
to Sven's garage.

09:03.667 --> 09:04.817
- No, n-n-n-n-no!
- No.

09:04.942 --> 09:06.118
Come on.

09:06.243 --> 09:08.220
Gonna let somebody else
put their hands on your baby?

09:08.345 --> 09:09.688
- Yeah, we're a couple of men.
- Yeah.

09:09.813 --> 09:11.290
- Men work on cars.
- Okay.

09:11.415 --> 09:12.925
I think I'm gonna t the men

09:13.050 --> 09:14.345
a couple of burgers, all right?

09:14.511 --> 09:16.028
'Cause I know
my two little grease monkeys

09:16.153 --> 09:17.696
are gonna get
a little appetite worked up.

09:17.821 --> 09:19.934
Daddy's hungry.
Yeah.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.134
Hey, why don't we get
a full-on pop-dog?

09:22.259 --> 09:23.938
We're working
with a semi-pop-dog right now.

09:24.104 --> 09:25.271
- Coming right up.
- We're at a half-pop.

09:25.396 --> 09:26.672
We need to be a full-on pop-dog, yo.

09:26.797 --> 09:28.985
- Full-pop coming right up.
- Full pop-doggie.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.112
And, the hood popped!

09:31.278 --> 09:33.323
No, you popped the trunk there.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.991
- I know.
- Do you not know how to...

09:35.157 --> 09:36.615
No, I know.
I got a sweatshirt.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.284
It's gonna get cold soon, you know?

09:38.409 --> 09:39.329
We're gonna be out here.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.619
I think it's...

09:40.744 --> 09:42.087
We're at a half-pop-doggie right now.

09:42.212 --> 09:44.500
- I wanna go to the full pop.
- I know, I know, I know.

09:44.666 --> 09:47.326
If I recall, in my auto training,

09:47.451 --> 09:49.047
when I was 16, there's a...

09:49.213 --> 09:50.798
Secret latch.

09:50.964 --> 09:52.008
Ha-ha!

09:52.174 --> 09:53.799
Oh! Yes!

09:53.924 --> 09:55.701
- Secret latch?
- Whoo!

09:55.826 --> 09:56.721
Did you see that, Blake?

09:56.887 --> 09:59.015
Um, Ders, secret latch?

09:59.181 --> 10:00.072
Secret latch.

10:00.197 --> 10:01.476
This guy knew about secret latches.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.518
- Unbelievable. I'm blown away.
- It's crazy.

10:02.684 --> 10:03.942
So, what do we got here, right?

10:04.067 --> 10:05.544
- What are we looking at?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:05.669 --> 10:09.567
I'm gonna go right off the bat
and say it's the carburetor.

10:09.733 --> 10:11.350
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:11.475 --> 10:13.152
That's a...
That's a pretty good assumption.

10:13.277 --> 10:14.386
Yes.

10:14.511 --> 10:16.388
But quite frankly,
I think you're wrong.

10:16.513 --> 10:17.823
I think it's the gasket.

10:17.948 --> 10:19.158
- Mm.
- Yeah, that gasket...

10:19.283 --> 10:20.626
That's weird right there.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.561
This whole region right here
is looking a little funky.

10:22.686 --> 10:25.464
You know what,
we might need a new region.

10:25.589 --> 10:26.665
Oh, come on.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.000
Now, regions
are common problems in Volvos.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.420
- Possibly.
- Don't say that.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.236
I do know one thing is for sure.

10:31.361 --> 10:32.638
It's not the battery zone,

10:32.763 --> 10:34.133
and I got some burgers to prove it.

10:34.299 --> 10:35.140
Ooh, that's true.

10:35.265 --> 10:36.208
And we got margaritas to prove it.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.262
Battery's working great.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.644
And we have waffles to prove it,

10:38.769 --> 10:40.546
and then we had the iPod dock
also proving it.

10:40.671 --> 10:42.848
Jamming.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.183
It's probably the battery zone.

10:44.308 --> 10:45.853
It's the battery.
We wore down the battery.

10:46.019 --> 10:47.419
Here we go!

10:47.544 --> 10:48.606
- Oh!
- Okay.

10:48.772 --> 10:50.589
We can do it!
Put some glute into it!

10:50.714 --> 10:52.026
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

10:52.192 --> 10:53.726
Oh, this is cool!

10:53.851 --> 10:55.494
I'm glad we didn't call AAA

10:55.619 --> 10:57.699
and took fate
into our own hands like Conan.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.298
Ow, ow. I got it.
Anchor.

10:59.423 --> 11:00.999
Holy Moly, look at this classic.

11:01.124 --> 11:03.102
Yeah, she's pretty, got nice lines,

11:03.227 --> 11:04.737
but nothing on the Swedish
meatball here.

11:04.862 --> 11:05.999
Yeah.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.710
That is American muscle.
That car fought in Vietnam.

11:08.876 --> 11:10.169
All right, men.

11:10.335 --> 11:11.910
Here's my credit card.
Go get some man snacks.

11:12.035 --> 11:13.548
- Yeah.
- Pay for the battery.

11:13.714 --> 11:16.548
I'm gonna go, uh,
rap with the engineer here.

11:16.673 --> 11:17.552
- See what he can tell me.
- You got it.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.637
Oh, get some, uh, beef jerky.

11:19.803 --> 11:21.639
But not the peppered.
I've got acid reflux.

11:21.805 --> 11:24.600
Wash your window for $1.57.

11:24.766 --> 11:25.727
Are you gonna buy beer with it?

11:25.893 --> 11:27.687
No.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.898
Oh, well, then, I'm sorry.
Our money's actually for beer.

11:31.064 --> 11:33.318
I'm gonna get schnapps.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.820
- Yeah, schnapps. Cool, cool.
- Yeah. Awesome.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.488
- We love booze too.
- A dollar.

11:37.654 --> 11:39.138
- Oh, I don't have any money.
- No cash.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.839
Do you have a card swiper?
'Cause I'll give you...

11:40.964 --> 11:41.868
I'll give you, like, $1,000.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.453
No.

11:43.619 --> 11:44.443
We'll look for a hat for you.

11:44.568 --> 11:45.911
- Yeah.
- We'll get you a hat.

11:46.036 --> 11:46.912
That's why homeless people
should have card swipers.

11:47.037 --> 11:47.980
They should.

11:48.105 --> 11:49.381
I'd make a great homeless person.

11:49.506 --> 11:51.252
I'd just carry a card swiper.

11:51.418 --> 11:53.685
Thanks a lot, Mike.

11:53.810 --> 11:56.299
I'd tip you, but my buddy's
got my credit card, so.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.344
Hey-oh! And the Snacksters
are back-Ders!

11:59.510 --> 12:00.426
Whoa.

12:00.551 --> 12:01.760
How was the battery swap educational?

12:01.885 --> 12:03.162
Uh, he didn't let me watch,

12:03.287 --> 12:05.433
but he's got
a super-cool iguana inside.

12:05.599 --> 12:06.932
- What?
- Really?

12:07.057 --> 12:08.000
- Yeah, you should check it out.
- Cool.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.020
What'd the battery run me?

12:09.186 --> 12:10.803
Mmm...
I don't know.

12:10.928 --> 12:12.905
It was, like, two,
or three, or... 200 bu...

12:13.030 --> 12:14.473
I think it was, like, 100 bucks.

12:14.598 --> 12:16.141
I don't know, money's
not a thing to me anymore.

12:16.266 --> 12:17.362
'Cause I just charged to the game.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.644
Yeah, now with that credit card,

12:18.769 --> 12:20.212
you can get whatever you want,
whenever you want,

12:20.337 --> 12:21.246
and it's all, like, free, basically.

12:21.371 --> 12:22.367
Yeah, it's awesome.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.483
All right, guys,
about the credit card...

12:24.608 --> 12:25.495
Just a guideline...

12:25.661 --> 12:26.485
- Ride to the north!
- Yeah!

12:26.610 --> 12:27.830
Okay, going north.

12:28.078 --> 12:29.822
If you're a viking, and you
scream that with a beard,

12:29.947 --> 12:30.875
- that's manly.
- Whoo!

12:31.041 --> 12:32.502
Wait.

12:32.668 --> 12:33.586
Oh, grab your guns!

12:33.752 --> 12:35.421
Grab your guns!

12:35.587 --> 12:37.423
Oh, is this... is this
the little guy we're gonna get?

12:37.589 --> 12:38.864
Yeah, we're gonna kill this dude.

12:38.989 --> 12:41.390
Just get your... thing.

12:44.695 --> 12:46.808
Holy Moly, she's a thick bitch.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.768
- She is.
- A worthy adversary.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.937
That's why I'm gonna string up
and go for her first.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.730
Yeah, right, Ders.
First come, first kill, bud.

12:52.896 --> 12:54.012
I don't know, guys.

12:54.137 --> 12:55.047
It's just a dude
diving in a dumpster.

12:55.172 --> 12:56.359
We've all been there.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.486
Blake, it's cute.
It's a cute raccoon.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.853
Doesn't mean
it doesn't deserve to die,

13:00.978 --> 13:04.857
because I'm a man.

13:04.982 --> 13:06.558
Stop shaking and take the shot.

13:06.683 --> 13:07.954
I'm not nervous right now.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.628
I didn't say you were nervous.

13:09.753 --> 13:10.623
Well, I'm not, then.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.583
Shh, quiet.
There's animals.

13:14.558 --> 13:16.802
Oh, hey! Hey!

13:21.341 --> 13:22.885
- Oh, my God!
- That was awesome!

13:23.051 --> 13:24.887
- You saved my girl catcher.
- What?

13:25.053 --> 13:27.181
That's what I'm calling my
face now..."The girl catcher."

13:27.347 --> 13:30.101
Hey, Cassie,
I got you some corn nuts.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.437
You killed my raccoon.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.114
No, sir, back up.
We're hunting here, okay?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.074
Yeah, we're hunting, it's cool!

13:45.240 --> 13:46.517
Adam, finish him.
Babe-ality.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.052
- Good call. Babe-ality.
- Be humane.

13:48.177 --> 13:50.387
I'm just gonna swiftly
sever the spinal cord.

13:50.512 --> 13:51.456
- Save the good meat, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

13:54.149 --> 13:56.377
That's my Cassie!

13:56.543 --> 13:57.712
Oh, is that why it has a collar?

13:57.878 --> 13:59.088
I was... I was wondering
why it had a col...

13:59.254 --> 14:00.590
- Oh, it's yours.
- Oh, thank God.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.341
She's still breathing.

14:02.507 --> 14:04.469
I don't know about that.
That might be the rigamorphis.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.969
That was a really good hunting kick.

14:06.094 --> 14:07.346
- That was a death-blow, for sure.
- Thank you.

14:07.512 --> 14:09.440
- Guys, guys, it's his pet.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

14:09.565 --> 14:10.441
I'm just saying.

14:10.566 --> 14:11.476
Give me your car keys!

14:11.642 --> 14:14.020
I'll take her to the vet.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.213
Or we could let her die with dignity

14:16.338 --> 14:18.515
next to the trash can,
and then honor her legacy

14:18.640 --> 14:19.901
by mounting her
on the hood of the `Vo.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.118
- Yeah.
- That's a good idea.

14:21.243 --> 14:22.987
- Honor, legacy...
- Honor, dignity...

14:23.153 --> 14:24.621
Give me the keys!

14:24.746 --> 14:25.781
Look, sir, you can't just yell at us.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.357
We're three tough men.

14:27.482 --> 14:28.926
And if you want the keys,

14:29.051 --> 14:31.037
you're gonna have to go in my
pocket and get it yourself.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.463
Yeah, yeah.

14:32.588 --> 14:33.414
Don't think I don't know
how to reload this thing,

14:33.580 --> 14:35.265
'cause I... [strains] I do...

14:35.390 --> 14:37.034
Yeah, and I'm, uh,
buzzing pretty good,

14:37.159 --> 14:39.045
so just buzz off, Buzzter.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.755
Shut up!

14:40.921 --> 14:42.406
You tried to kill the only thing

14:42.531 --> 14:45.676
that means anything to me
in this [Bleep] World.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.579
Now, gimme your car keys
or I'll rip your dicks off

14:48.704 --> 14:50.681
and [Bleep] You
in the holes that it leaves.

14:50.847 --> 14:54.227
She takes premium!

14:54.393 --> 14:55.811
Well, there goes our man trip.

14:57.854 --> 14:59.148
Thought you got it fixed.

14:59.314 --> 15:01.082
This is a stick!

15:01.358 --> 15:02.360
It is?

15:02.526 --> 15:04.094
Well, which one of you little
Is gonna come along

15:04.219 --> 15:05.363
and teach me how to drive?

15:05.529 --> 15:07.782
I can't, legally.
Yeah, I have a lot of DUIs.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.466
- I'll go...
- Come on!

15:09.591 --> 15:10.993
Guys, if I die, spread my ashes

15:11.159 --> 15:13.162
at the Pasadena aquatic center!

15:13.328 --> 15:15.248
- Okay.
- You have to pop the clutch.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.207
And at my funeral, play <i>Kells!</i>

15:17.332 --> 15:19.610
Okay, use the clutch.

15:19.735 --> 15:22.312
We should have
fought that dude, man!

15:22.437 --> 15:23.480
What is this weekend all about

15:23.605 --> 15:24.882
if we're still gonna
be giant pussies?

15:25.007 --> 15:28.118
Yeah, I know, but he said,
"A hole."

15:28.243 --> 15:29.220
I shut down.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.655
Real men would have
stood up for themselves

15:31.780 --> 15:34.024
and fought the man,
but we're not real men,

15:34.149 --> 15:35.476
we're little... boys!

15:35.642 --> 15:36.593
I know.
What should we do?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.980
Maybe call our dads, or Karl?

15:39.146 --> 15:40.164
No, man!
We got to save Ders!

15:40.289 --> 15:41.107
That's what we got to do!

15:41.273 --> 15:42.566
But we better act fast.

15:42.691 --> 15:43.818
He's probably making Ders
give him road head.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.336
That feels good right there.

15:46.461 --> 15:47.538
Tell me when to pop.

15:47.663 --> 15:49.239
No, just...
Just do it when you feel it.

15:49.364 --> 15:50.199
Well, here it comes.

15:50.365 --> 15:51.642
Go!

15:51.767 --> 15:52.743
- See?
- Yeah.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.011
- That's changing gears.
- Yeah.

15:54.136 --> 15:55.212
My dad taught me the same way.

15:55.337 --> 15:56.213
He put his hands on my feet,

15:56.338 --> 15:57.414
showed me how to work it.

15:57.539 --> 15:58.682
You swear you've never
done this before?

15:58.807 --> 16:00.551
Scout's honor.

16:00.676 --> 16:02.386
Well, you're damn good.
I'm impressed.

16:02.511 --> 16:03.654
Well, you're a damn good teacher.

16:03.779 --> 16:05.840
I... I appreciate your patience.
How's Cassie?

16:06.006 --> 16:08.926
She's gonna be all right.
I think she's okay.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.227
And again, I'm sorry about that.

16:10.352 --> 16:12.262
When I kicked her,
I didn't know she was your pet.

16:12.387 --> 16:15.199
It's just, me and my guys,
we set out on this man weekend

16:15.324 --> 16:18.969
to be, like, hunters, and prove
something to ourselves,

16:19.094 --> 16:20.804
when truth be told,
I'd rather be at home

16:20.929 --> 16:23.316
drinking boon's farm and just
bumping some Jamie Foxx, man.

16:23.482 --> 16:26.176
Jamie Foxx?

16:26.301 --> 16:28.011
- Yeah, yeah.
- What? Yes, I like Jamie Foxx.

16:28.136 --> 16:29.279
Yeah, me too!

16:29.404 --> 16:31.014
You realize you're
kind of like Jamie Foxx

16:31.139 --> 16:32.366
in that movie <i>collateral</i> right now?

16:32.532 --> 16:34.117
- Oh, my God, I am.
- Yeah!

16:34.242 --> 16:35.852
That's so cool!

16:35.977 --> 16:37.287
- And that's... you're tom cruise.
- Yeah!

16:37.412 --> 16:38.331
Oh, man.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.090
- This is so cool.
- Oh, yeah, this is cool.

16:40.215 --> 16:41.592
God, they make
the best movies together.

16:41.717 --> 16:42.593
They need to do more.

16:42.718 --> 16:43.594
I gotta shift again.

16:43.719 --> 16:44.629
- Yep, go into third.
- Ready?

16:47.155 --> 16:48.232
I feel badass!

16:48.357 --> 16:49.233
Yeah, 'cause we are badass right now!

16:49.358 --> 16:50.767
This is so badass!

16:50.892 --> 16:53.095
But I've never driven before.
I don't know if I can do it.

16:53.261 --> 16:54.972
Ders' life is in our hands, okay?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.473
You got to step up
to the streets, man.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.674
Let's just catch up to 'em.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.685
Daddy Demamp
will take care of the rest.

16:59.851 --> 17:01.612
All right.

17:01.737 --> 17:03.981
Buckle up.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.523
We're about to get nuts.

17:05.690 --> 17:09.111
I got dry-roasted, but they
only had cashew hal... halves!

17:09.277 --> 17:11.989
Yeah! Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
I'm doing it!

17:12.114 --> 17:13.240
- I'm doing it!
- Yeah!

17:13.406 --> 17:16.792
Hey, you ever see
that Jamie Foxx special, uh,

17:16.917 --> 17:17.828
<i>I might need security?</i>

17:17.993 --> 17:19.061
You ever see that?

17:19.186 --> 17:20.039
What do you think, Doug?

17:20.204 --> 17:21.332
Bo-wow-wow!

17:21.498 --> 17:22.531
Bo-wow-wow!

17:22.656 --> 17:24.877
"I got the flag,
player, I got the flag."

17:27.671 --> 17:28.673
There she blows.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.508
Aye aye.

17:35.871 --> 17:36.722
Yo!

17:36.888 --> 17:38.148
- That's my buddies.
- Hey!

17:38.273 --> 17:39.308
Where did you get that car?

17:39.474 --> 17:40.851
Check it out!

17:41.017 --> 17:42.144
No, don't!

17:42.310 --> 17:45.389
Ders says that dude
is trying to kill him!

17:45.514 --> 17:47.758
I'm glad we made it here
before he got bludgeoned!

17:47.883 --> 17:48.943
Yeah, well, you know,

17:49.109 --> 17:50.827
when you got Uncle Blazer
behind the wheel,

17:50.952 --> 17:52.613
things tend to go un-bludgeoned!

17:52.779 --> 17:53.989
- Hey, what's he doing?
- I don't know!

17:54.155 --> 17:55.098
I'm Jamie Foxx and he's tom cruise!

17:55.223 --> 17:56.075
Yeah!

17:56.241 --> 17:57.167
Get up close!

17:57.292 --> 17:58.911
I'm gonna shoot out the tire!

17:59.077 --> 18:00.788
Yes.
You're okay to fire!

18:00.954 --> 18:03.440
I'm... yeah, I'm going to, okay?

18:03.565 --> 18:04.709
It's very windy up here!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.794
Yes, I know!
We'll get snacks later!

18:10.422 --> 18:13.676
I got... I'm not nervous!

18:13.842 --> 18:14.951
Damn it!

18:15.076 --> 18:16.303
Keep it steady in here, dude!

18:16.469 --> 18:17.688
Come on, man,
I'm a first-time driver.

18:17.813 --> 18:19.181
I'm like a student driver, basically.

18:19.347 --> 18:20.766
You're doing a great job, okay?

18:20.932 --> 18:21.858
Yeah, thanks, man.

18:21.983 --> 18:23.352
You're out of ammo!
Here, take this!

18:23.518 --> 18:26.355
Ooh, I like that.

18:26.521 --> 18:29.525
Adam, Ders needs you.
He saved your girl catcher.

18:29.691 --> 18:33.362
Thanks for calling it that, man.

Oh!

I'm good. I'm good.
That didn't even hurt.

19:10.856 --> 19:12.033
- What?
- That didn't even hurt.

19:12.158 --> 19:13.568
It looked like it hurt,
but it didn't even.

19:13.693 --> 19:15.237
Okay, all right, we'll do
a little bit of this here.

Guys, come on, relax.

19:24.070 --> 19:25.279
His name's Doug.
He's cool, okay?

19:25.404 --> 19:26.290
Smoothed things over.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.648
I was just gonna take him to the vet

19:27.773 --> 19:28.983
and co back and get you guys,
but what are you doing?

19:29.108 --> 19:30.918
We're... we were, uh,
gonna come back as heroes

19:31.043 --> 19:32.854
and save your ass, uh, though.

19:32.979 --> 19:34.799
Yeah, and, uh,
I drove the car though.

19:34.965 --> 19:35.883
- What?
- Yeah.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.468
And we bought a car
with your credit card though.

19:37.634 --> 19:38.135
You what?

19:38.351 --> 19:39.595
Well, you're gonna get
lots of yogurt though.

19:39.761 --> 19:40.695
Look, we're not cut out
for this guys' stuff.

19:40.820 --> 19:41.696
Can I just say that out loud?

19:41.821 --> 19:42.897
Hey, what the heck?

19:43.022 --> 19:44.183
This might not be
our will forte, who knows?

19:44.349 --> 19:45.100
It definitely isn't.

19:45.266 --> 19:46.685
We're no MacGrubers.

19:46.851 --> 19:48.402
Okay, so why don't we
just go get Doug,

19:48.527 --> 19:50.371
and kick it with his brother,
who owns a wiener-schnitzel?

19:50.496 --> 19:51.939
He said he'd hook us up right now.

19:52.064 --> 19:53.359
- What?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.342
Yo, Jamie!

19:54.467 --> 19:58.030
Wow-wow-wow!

19:58.196 --> 19:59.990
What are you doing?

20:01.841 --> 20:03.784
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

20:03.909 --> 20:05.786

20:05.911 --> 20:09.375
I mean, Doug!

20:09.541 --> 20:12.253
Well, there goes our...
Chili cheese dogs.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.561
Ah, it's okay.
Let's go to a bar.

20:13.686 --> 20:15.129
Let's go get drunk.
I'm ready to go.

20:15.254 --> 20:17.165
I'm okay, I'm good to go.
I'm good to... go right now.

20:17.290 --> 20:18.166
- Okay, shh.
- Whoo!

20:18.291 --> 20:19.510
I think I got a better idea.

20:19.676 --> 20:20.768
Oh, my gosh, you guys.

20:20.893 --> 20:23.504
Rihanna tore the roof
off that mothersucker tonight.

20:23.629 --> 20:24.505
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, she did!

20:24.630 --> 20:25.673
She's good!

20:25.798 --> 20:27.208
By the way, guys, no more <i>Kells.</i>

20:27.333 --> 20:29.177
I want Rihanna's <i>Take a Bow</i>
played at my funeral.

20:29.302 --> 20:30.178
Good call.

20:30.303 --> 20:31.279
She was whipping her Booty

20:31.404 --> 20:32.356
like nothing I've ever seen before.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.182
I think I can do that.

20:34.307 --> 20:36.050
Take it down, you idiot.

20:36.175 --> 20:38.904
Oh, looks like we got a r-r-rude boy.

20:39.070 --> 20:40.906
Go home.
You're acting like children.

20:41.072 --> 20:43.191
Jillian?

20:43.316 --> 20:44.725
Excuse me, boys.

20:44.850 --> 20:47.361
Sir, you've got about
five seconds to get out of here,

20:47.486 --> 20:49.748
before I beat your ass

20:49.914 --> 20:51.999
in front of your ugly,
funky-butt children!

20:52.124 --> 20:53.210
Yeah!

20:53.376 --> 20:54.936
They called me
the "Dad Ruiner" in high school!

20:55.061 --> 20:55.937
- What?
- Rihanna!
