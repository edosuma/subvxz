WEBVTT

00:10.440 --> 00:14.570
Shit. I swear I deleted a picture,

00:14.640 --> 00:19.726
but when I clicked back to the album,
the icon reappeared, it undeleted itself.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.041
But I can't get it to happen again, so...

00:22.120 --> 00:23.849
Hey, Richard, totally out of the blue,

00:23.960 --> 00:25.928
do you know how
we might be able to find that bug?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.209
No, Dinesh. We are not releasing the beta.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.488
We integrated the neural net a week ago.
The platform is full of bugs.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.086
But that is what a beta is for.

00:35.160 --> 00:40.291
You give it to people in the real world,
they use it, and that is how we find the bugs.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.283
Richard, Reid Hoffman says

00:42.360 --> 00:45.204
if you're not mortally embarrassed
by the quality of your initial release,

00:45.280 --> 00:46.566
you've released too late.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.371
Okay. We already are mortally embarrassed.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.126
Okay? We move in
and, subsequently, out of our offices,

00:53.240 --> 00:55.049
mainly because it was too expensive.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.284
We fired two CEOs, we've pivoted to a box,
and then pivoted back.

00:59.360 --> 01:02.807
Any more bad word-of-mouth
and we will be royally fucked.

01:03.320 --> 01:04.765
Where's Gilfoyle?

01:06.640 --> 01:10.611
Hey, Gilfoyle, the deletion issue
is ducking me again, and, um...

01:10.680 --> 01:11.727
I'm sorry.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.001
<i>Well, hey, Richard.</i>

01:13.520 --> 01:14.646
Hi, Tara.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.569
I need to borrow your fella here for a second.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.330
All right, babe, I gotta go.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.603
Hey, when you check out the settings view,

01:20.680 --> 01:22.091
can you let me know
if there's something weird

01:22.160 --> 01:23.366
that happens with the submit button?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.841
It was a little weird when I was doing QA.

01:25.920 --> 01:26.921
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

01:27.000 --> 01:30.129
- Sorry, the settings view for...
- The beta.

01:30.200 --> 01:32.487
- The beta for...
- Pied Piper.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.803
It's a promising compression company
that doesn't pay very well.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.291
- You sent her the beta?
- I did.

01:37.360 --> 01:40.443
Are you fucking insane?
It's not ready. It's riddled with bugs.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.922
<i>Really? Cause I've been test-driving it all day,
and it's pretty fucking awesome.</i>

01:44.720 --> 01:45.767
Really? You think so?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.365
Yeah. For real.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.408
<i>Congratulations, Richard. It's so fucking cool.</i>

01:49.480 --> 01:51.562
<i>And when the neural net kicks in,
it's gonna be rad.</i>

01:51.640 --> 01:53.483
<i>But, you know,
I did have one problem, though.</i>

01:53.560 --> 01:56.564
<i>I tried to restore an old file
and it asked me to confirm twice.</i>

01:56.640 --> 01:58.449
Yeah, well, that was a bad merge.

01:58.520 --> 02:01.205
It's been there for months.
I fixed it in 10 seconds.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.370
Richard...

02:04.640 --> 02:05.801
Maybe.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.690
Yeah, maybe beta.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.160
<i>- Hi, Dinesh.
Java.</i>

02:25.360 --> 02:26.725
Wait, that can't be right.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.802
How can Bachmanity
still be so far in the hole?

02:28.880 --> 02:30.564
Look at all this shit that Big Head is selling.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.563
He was renting
virtually everything in the house.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.685
He rented that cannon?

02:35.240 --> 02:39.325
It was for display purposes only.
So you forfeit your deposit.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.165
It's a cannon.
What's he supposed to do, not fire it?

02:42.240 --> 02:43.526
That was the provision.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.005
So that's it then, I guess.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.570
Big Head's really broke.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.364
You know what? He's young. He'll get past it.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.801
Nelson is not the only one
who should be worried.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.882
- You were partners.
- Fair point.

02:54.960 --> 02:59.249
But shuttering a company in the tech world
is almost a rite of passage,

02:59.320 --> 03:00.606
like herpes simplex one.

03:00.680 --> 03:05.481
At first, it's ugly and embarrassing
and you're disgusted by your own dick.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.200
But after a while,

03:07.280 --> 03:09.521
in the larger scheme of things,
you realize it's really...

03:09.600 --> 03:12.729
Mr. Bachman, you structured Bachmanity
as a general partnership.

03:12.800 --> 03:17.601
Then, with no money in the bank,
you threw a million-dollar luau on Alcatraz.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.920
You're on the hook for that.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.046
And even declaring bankruptcy
isn't going to absolve you of these debts.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.724
Bankruptcy?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.370
it's none of my business. Good luck.

03:26.440 --> 03:29.250
Wait, where are you going?
We need you. You're our business manager.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.607
There's no business remaining to manage.

03:31.680 --> 03:32.966
Good day, Mr. Bachman.

03:34.640 --> 03:35.766
Hey, good news.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.569
They said we can each
keep one of the cannonballs,

03:37.640 --> 03:39.449
so not a total loss, right?

03:42.920 --> 03:45.571
All right, so I've set up
a sign-up page for the beta.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.120
Now, we're gonna keep it small and secure,

03:48.200 --> 03:52.171
so that means we're limited
to 10 invite codes each to send out.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.126
I've already got my list.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.043
It's people that I know personally,

03:56.480 --> 03:59.370
and people that I know I can trust.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.887
Hmm, we only get 10 each.
This could be prickly.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.008
Well, I'm out. I don't trust anyone.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.764
It's a huge part of my belief system.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.047
You sent the beta to Tara.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.771
Yeah, there was a transactional nature
to that exchange,

04:11.840 --> 04:13.968
-which I'll get into if you want.
- Pass.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.123
But it doesn't mean that I trust her,
and I certainly don't trust anyone else.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.608
Oh, in other words, you have no friends.

04:20.680 --> 04:21.680
On principle.

04:21.760 --> 04:26.721
I could make what rises to your low
standards of a friend any time I want.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.847
Sure you could.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.561
Gilfoyle, if you're not gonna use your 10
invites, could Dinesh and I have them?

04:31.640 --> 04:34.450
Sure. Knock yourselves out.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.124
Loser. He's got no friends.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.040
Okay.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.600
Miriam, Sylvia...

04:45.840 --> 04:49.447
Oh, Samantha!
I almost forgot her.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.922
You know, Jared, you can have
all 10 of Gilfoyle's invites.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.726
- Much appreciated.
- Yeah.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.850
Monica, hello.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.651
Um, did you honestly think that you could
send me an email

05:00.720 --> 05:04.406
telling me that you were launching the beta
without sending me the beta?

05:04.480 --> 05:05.925
<i>Come on. I'm dying to see it.</i>

05:06.000 --> 05:08.571
Well, I think the whole point, Monica,
is to get the beta

05:08.640 --> 05:10.290
into the hands of unbiased people

05:10.360 --> 05:12.647
so they can give us an honest feedback,
you know.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.802
Besides, I just gave out my 10 invites.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.930
Oh, if Monica wants an invite,
I could, like, squeeze her on my list.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.048
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, no problem.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.009
Okay, Monica, well, you're in luck.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.845
Dinesh has decided to give you
one of his codes, so...

05:25.920 --> 05:28.651
Great. I promise I'll find
something terrible to say.

05:29.720 --> 05:33.805
Okay, so I did a rough accounting

05:33.880 --> 05:36.281
of your assets and liabilities.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.886
Jared, don't look at me like that.
Just give it to me straight.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.885
All right. Your house has appreciated
in value since you bought it,

05:42.960 --> 05:46.646
but if you sold it now
for what Zillow and Redfin think it's worth...

05:46.720 --> 05:48.449
I'd still be half a million in the hole.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.648
Now, that's the bad news.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.891
- Is there good news?
- Well, it's unclear.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.531
I went back through your records.

05:56.600 --> 06:01.208
Uh, at first, I'll admit, a bit voyeuristically,
uh, to see where all of the money went,

06:01.280 --> 06:04.204
and apart from the party expenses,
which were staggering...

06:04.280 --> 06:05.281
Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.010
But one number jumped out at me.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.204
Now, whoever did your accounting

06:09.280 --> 06:13.683
earmarked almost 70%
of Big Head's settlement money for taxes.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.520
70%?

06:15.600 --> 06:19.730
Even in Taxo-Alto, which I coined,
it would be half that.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.040
Where did that money go?

06:21.120 --> 06:24.442
Well, that is the $6-million question.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.045
I may have the answer.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.926
I'm sorry. You're accusing me of impropriety?

06:32.440 --> 06:35.728
You, the man who spent $20,000

06:35.800 --> 06:38.565
renting giant fiberglass tiki heads,

06:39.000 --> 06:40.001
and $40,000 more

06:40.080 --> 06:43.926
when one of them was misplaced
on the way back to the rental house?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.083
I told you it wasn't misplaced.
I know exactly where it is.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.242
It's at the bottom of the bay.

06:49.320 --> 06:53.086
I called you a thief because
you, sir, have stolen from us.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.004
Nelson, come on.
You can't possibly believe this.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.041
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize to him.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.770
- Oh, right. Sorry.
- Thank you.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.207
Arthur, you listen to me, and you listen good.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.762
I have people calling me 40 times a day
asking for their money.

07:07.040 --> 07:09.486
I even considered
selling my house to pay them.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.042
So you are going to go in your
little fucking piggy bank right now

07:13.160 --> 07:16.403
and pay back every fucking kopeck

07:16.720 --> 07:18.245
that you stole from Big Head.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.369
And if you don't,
we're gonna take our little show on the road,

07:21.720 --> 07:24.883
perhaps perform it for a man named the DA.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.525
Ridiculous.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.965
Very well.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.969
Game on.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.370
Let's go, Big Head.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.081
Wait.

07:38.160 --> 07:41.084
I may have moved around
some of your money

07:41.160 --> 07:42.924
in a way that wasn't exactly conventional.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.487
- Give me back Big Head's fucking money!
- Yeah!

07:45.560 --> 07:47.005
- Sorry. Sorry.
- No, you did good.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.562
I can't, because I don't have it.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.291
Hey, Marc, we may have a problem.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.601
What's up?

07:58.680 --> 08:00.728
Well, a buddy of mine at Datatrode

08:00.800 --> 08:04.009
sits next to a guy
who just got invited to Pied Piper's beta.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.923
Shit. They're already in beta?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.126
Should I tell Gavin?

08:07.200 --> 08:09.089
Fuck, no. We're still two or three months out.

08:09.160 --> 08:13.529
Yeah, if he hears Pied Piper's already in beta,
trust me, he'll lose his shit.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.685
Fine. But if it ever comes up,
I didn't hear about this.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.562
- And this came in when?
- Forty-three minutes ago.

08:22.640 --> 08:24.483
And deleted six minutes after that.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.245
Fortunately, the filters,
which I had installed, sir,

08:27.360 --> 08:28.725
caught the relevant keywords.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.689
I decided to walk it to you personally.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.366
An employee's withholding
critical information about a competitor.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.804
This is a fireable offense.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.325
You want me to bring this guy in?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.481
No.

08:37.559 --> 08:41.724
Acting on this would expose the fact
that we're reading employees' private emails,

08:41.799 --> 08:44.246
destroying the spirit of trust
and freedom to innovate

08:44.320 --> 08:46.368
that I've worked so hard to build here at Hooli.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.647
You know, it makes you wonder
if the word "Hooli"

08:48.720 --> 08:51.007
has any meaning for these people
whatsoever.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.686
Is there anything I can do?

08:53.040 --> 08:54.121
Yeah.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.489
Get me a look at that Pied Piper beta.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.449
I will figure out a way, sir.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.608
Finally. Where the fuck have you...

09:19.960 --> 09:22.281
- Hey, thanks for the lift, Kevin.
- Yeah, no worries.

09:22.920 --> 09:26.447
Oh, Kevin, this is Dinesh,
one of my coworkers.

09:26.520 --> 09:30.047
- Dinesh, this is Kevin. We met at Philz Coffee.
- Hey.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.650
- We're friends now. Isn't that right, Kevin?
- Yeah.

09:34.080 --> 09:37.880
All right, my friend.
I should get to work, so thanks for the lift.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.008
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the coffees.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.281
Oh...

09:42.960 --> 09:44.803
Catch you later, my friend.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.009
That was my friend, Kevin.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.526
Congratulations. You now have one friend.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.206
He also said there was
a bug on the landing page.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.731
- Well, how severe is it?
- Not bad.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.564
Compared to the rest of what he said,
it's nothing.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.170
Guys, uh, you might as well
hear this from me.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.528
Uh, I just had a long talk about the beta
with my friend, Todd Chambers.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.604
- The Dropbox guy?
- Yeah, he was employee number 11.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.762
Why did you send it to him?
He hates everything.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.604
Well, because I thought he would be
honest with me,

10:10.680 --> 10:13.684
and, um, he was, quite honest. Uh...

10:14.160 --> 10:18.051
He said that in the 15 years
he's been working in the Valley,

10:18.120 --> 10:21.408
our beta was the best beta he's ever seen.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.687
- By far.
- What? Really?

10:23.760 --> 10:25.649
I don't want to count our chickens
before they hatch.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.485
I mean, 3% of hatchlings
are born mutated or dead,

10:28.560 --> 10:31.723
but we may have
a healthy brood on our hands.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.810
I'm getting the same reaction.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.645
I mean, a few bugs here and there,
but overall, they love it.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.768
We might be holding pocket aces here.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.966
Awesome.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.321
Hey, guys.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.641
- How you holding up?
- Good, yeah.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.121
I mean, just trying to make sense
of all the feedback.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.044
Well, you know, I guess
you just can't let it get in your head.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.644
- Did you mean "go to my head"?
- What did I say?

10:53.720 --> 10:56.610
You said "get in your head,"
like it's a bad thing, but it's not.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.250
- It's great. People love it.
- Really?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.766
Yeah. Yeah. I can't believe it myself.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.046
They're flipping out.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.326
That's awesome. That...

11:03.400 --> 11:05.721
And that's for the beta that you sent me?

11:05.800 --> 11:08.610
No, Monica. It's for the other beta
that we've got kicking around here.

11:09.240 --> 11:15.885
I mean, I have an inbox full of raves here
for the upload performance, the mobile, the...

11:15.960 --> 11:17.803
What about the interface?

11:17.880 --> 11:20.121
Did people have any issues with that?

11:20.240 --> 11:21.765
No, not at all. Why?

11:22.320 --> 11:24.368
Do you have any issues with the interface?

11:24.800 --> 11:27.326
I haven't actually had a chance
to look at it yet.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.646
Are you serious?
You've been sitting on the beta for a day

11:30.720 --> 11:33.326
after busting my balls
about not getting an invite?

11:33.400 --> 11:34.925
Pretty fuckin' lame.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.843
Yeah. Sorry.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.649
Yeah. Lame.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.051
I just got an email from my friend,
Max Karnow.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.964
And he says, "I heard the beta's awesome.
Can I get a look?"

11:45.840 --> 11:48.002
Guys, I think we're starting to get some buzz.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.366
You know, maybe we should talk to Laurie
about moving up the official launch?

11:53.120 --> 11:55.202
- You want to move it up?
- Yeah, I think we're ready.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.442
I mean, do you think
you could set the meeting?

11:58.320 --> 11:59.401
Yeah.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.324
Yeah, I'll go tell Laurie right now.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.481
Okay.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.405
What was that about?

12:07.480 --> 12:09.209
She's fucking weird.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.361
Hey, Richard, um,

12:12.200 --> 12:14.202
if your friend Max Karnow needs an invite,

12:14.280 --> 12:17.170
you know, I could probably
squeeze him on my list.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.085
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

12:19.160 --> 12:21.925
I'll have to freeze out one of my boys,
but they'll get it.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.209
Just shoot me his email.

12:27.440 --> 12:30.762
The perpetrator has been losing money
for other clients for years,

12:30.840 --> 12:34.970
was lying to us and funneling our money
to said other clients,

12:35.040 --> 12:37.407
therein, fucking us.

12:37.480 --> 12:41.087
You know, I'm sorry to say
this is not an uncommon occurrence.

12:41.160 --> 12:45.404
Wait, it's not an uncommon... So then it...

12:46.080 --> 12:47.127
Okay, got it.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.441
So if it makes any difference,

12:49.520 --> 12:53.127
I'd like to vie for a lesser sentence,

12:53.200 --> 12:55.362
if after he makes full restitution,

12:55.440 --> 12:58.330
he would write a very convincing
public apology, preferably...

12:58.400 --> 12:59.526
Mr. Bachman,

13:00.160 --> 13:04.210
an action like this
is very expensive and time-consuming,

13:04.280 --> 13:07.568
and as you've already pointed out,
even if you do prevail,

13:07.680 --> 13:10.684
the money is gone,
unless you win a court order

13:10.760 --> 13:13.331
allowing you to raid
other innocent people's bank accounts,

13:13.400 --> 13:14.925
and that's a tough sell,

13:15.560 --> 13:19.485
even for a plaintiff who's more,
uh, sympathetic.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.722
Are you calling us unsympathetic?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.848
You just threw a million-dollar party.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.641
A tasteful Polynesian affair,
culturally accurate,

13:27.720 --> 13:29.563
which I'm sure you would appreciate,

13:29.840 --> 13:33.561
and one that we can no longer pay for
because this criminal has left us flat broke.

13:33.640 --> 13:34.721
Also not true.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.646
You have a large stake
in a company called Pied Piper.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.963
Yes, but I can't sell my shares at Pied Piper.
Not now.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.883
Wouldn't it cover your outstanding debts?

13:43.960 --> 13:47.089
Of course. But they could
potentially be worth billions.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.083
Yes, and how do you see
that playing to people

13:49.160 --> 13:51.811
who are being priced out of their homes
by rich tech people?

13:52.720 --> 13:54.768
Have either of you been on a jury?

13:54.840 --> 13:58.686
No, of course not. I always get out of it.
The fines are very reasonable.

13:58.760 --> 14:00.524
You don't just throw those things away?

14:00.600 --> 14:01.886
Gentlemen, let me tell you what I see.

14:01.960 --> 14:05.760
I see two able-bodied,
entitled young white men

14:05.840 --> 14:08.923
who lucked into more money than
most people see in five lifetimes,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.401
and who, if they hadn't
had their millions stolen,

14:11.480 --> 14:12.811
would have promptly squandered them

14:12.880 --> 14:16.771
on more things like
relocated swimming pools and lost tiki heads.

14:17.480 --> 14:19.289
It's not lost.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.446
I know exactly where it is. It's in the bay.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.411
And if your Coast Guard
would be a little more helpful,

14:26.480 --> 14:28.244
we probably could have
dragged it out of there by now.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.765
Mr. Bachman,

14:30.080 --> 14:33.971
you pay those caterers and bartenders
you owe money to,

14:34.040 --> 14:37.886
or I assure you that I will prosecute.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.766
Mr. Chugtai,

14:41.840 --> 14:45.287
I am gonna need all the phone numbers
of the people on your list.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.687
Why?

14:46.760 --> 14:49.331
I'm just calling everybody
that was on the beta

14:49.400 --> 14:53.166
and saying hi and a quick thank you
and then just a couple of follow-up questions.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.527
Yeah. I don't think so.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.170
What do you mean?

14:57.240 --> 14:59.322
Well, I mean, put yourself in their shoes.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.007
They're, like, snowboarding in Tahoe
or, like, banging some smokin' chick,

15:03.080 --> 15:06.801
and then this fuckin' nerd calls
and he wants to talk about his app.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.881
Buzz-kill.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.849
Wait. Your boys are where?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.282
Well, those are just hypotheticals.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.967
I mean, my boys could be anywhere.
I don't keep track of my boys.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.003
Actually, we can.

15:18.520 --> 15:22.650
We have the IP address and GPS coordinates
for every active user,

15:23.160 --> 15:26.243
so we can figure out
just where your boys are at.

15:26.560 --> 15:30.007
Um, you added a god-view?
When did you do that?

15:30.080 --> 15:33.209
Right before I gave it to Tara.
I told you, trust no one.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.126
Oh, that is very cool. Nice work, Gilfoyle.

15:36.240 --> 15:40.086
And we can isolate each of our users.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.400
Dinesh's, for example...

15:41.480 --> 15:45.963
Before we invade people's privacy,
there is a conversation about ethics.

15:46.040 --> 15:50.409
Why is it that five of your users
show up at this address?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.130
Oh, it's buggy.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.410
Should we beta-test the god-view?

15:55.480 --> 15:58.165
I'm happy to drag this out
as long as you want to.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.041
Fine.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.882
I was having trouble filling up my list,
so I made up a few people.

16:04.400 --> 16:08.485
Well, people do create imaginary friends
to meet their emotional needs.

16:08.560 --> 16:12.451
When I was little, I used to pretend that
I shared a room with Harriet Tubman

16:12.520 --> 16:14.409
and we were always planning our big escape.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.207
Wait.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.887
Who is this,
and why are they at the Hooli campus?

16:21.000 --> 16:22.001
What?

16:22.080 --> 16:23.809
Did you give the beta
to someone at fucking Hooli?

16:23.920 --> 16:25.126
Who's Max Karnow?

16:25.200 --> 16:29.205
Oh! That's not one of my friends.
I have no friends. Got him from Richard.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.089
No. No, that can't be right.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.689
I went
to Hendricks' Facebook page.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.001
I found a friend of his
that lived near Palo Alto,

16:36.080 --> 16:38.924
searched his name and found
that he was in the tech business.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.244
I then came up with a great idea
to dummy up an email account in his name,

16:43.760 --> 16:47.446
sent a beta request to Hendricks,
and then voila'.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.410
- That's incredible.
- Yes, well, it is my craft.

16:50.480 --> 16:54.485
You see, I think security detail
is like creating great jazz where we...

16:54.560 --> 16:58.201
What are you talk... I'm talking about the beta.
Will you shut the fuck up?

16:58.880 --> 17:00.564
Fuck, this is good.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.291
Their sign-up flow, their mobile app,
it's just seamless.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.646
How are they doing this?

17:04.960 --> 17:07.088
I can put a team on that, sir.
If you want to know how they...

17:07.160 --> 17:09.845
What? Why are you so high-maintenance?

17:09.920 --> 17:12.241
- Do you want me to answer that, sir?
- No! God damn it!

17:12.319 --> 17:13.970
You're so needy!

17:14.720 --> 17:19.442
Okay, I just talked to the real Max Karnow,
and he had no idea about the beta.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.046
Wow, um, clearly, we're dealing
with a Hooli spy here.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.248
So what do we do?

17:25.319 --> 17:27.766
I mean, shut down his account, obviously.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.730
Yeah. On it. Sorry, Dinesh.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.891
You will now have one less fake friend.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.526
Wait, Gilfoyle.

17:35.600 --> 17:40.003
Is shutting down this guy's account really
the worst thing we can think of to do to him?

17:40.840 --> 17:42.842
Oh, my God. Where the fuck is my head?

17:43.680 --> 17:45.170
Stand by.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.568
Look at their compression ratios.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.371
The more files uploaded, the better they get?

17:51.440 --> 17:52.646
Are we doing that?

17:53.080 --> 17:54.764
No. Not really.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.411
That's gotta be some kind of
machine learning optimization.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.767
- Maybe a neural net?
- Well, then I want that.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.401
You need to put that into our platform. Now.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.404
I'm not even sure we have the resources here
to engineer something like that.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.285
And even if we did, our platform
isn't designed to accommodate it.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.687
You're talking about a ground-up rebuild.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.490
Great. So do that. And beat them to market.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.646
That's impossible.

18:17.720 --> 18:19.085
You're at Hooli now, Marc.

18:19.840 --> 18:24.687
And in case you didn't know, here at Hooli,
we make the impossible possible.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.290
So if I say I need...

18:27.640 --> 18:29.483
- What the fuck is happening?
- Oh, shit!

18:29.560 --> 18:31.449
It looks like a zip bomb.
They must know it's us.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.126
- That hard drive is fucked.
- This is my personal laptop.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.851
You opened a stolen beta
on your personal computer?

18:36.920 --> 18:38.809
Yes. And I installed it on my phone.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.203
Shit. It could fry the entire system.

18:42.280 --> 18:44.169
- Cut the power to the building!
- No, Gavin.

18:44.240 --> 18:47.528
It's isolated to your user account,
so it's just your laptop and your phone.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.523
It has no impact on the rest of the network.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.489
You don't know that. You don't know shit.
None of you do!

18:51.560 --> 18:53.801
You don't even know
what Hendricks is capable of.

18:53.880 --> 18:58.442
Cut the power to the building!
Cut the power to the building!

18:59.080 --> 19:00.684
And that's that.

19:01.320 --> 19:05.564
- And now, delete user.
- Nice.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.606
Wait, is that Monica? She finally opened it.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.682
Oh, yeah. Well, that's odd.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.603
It says here that
she started using it yesterday.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.002
Wait, so she lied?

19:15.080 --> 19:17.128
Why would she lie about using the beta?

19:17.280 --> 19:19.965
Yeah, why would Dinesh lie
about having friends?

19:20.040 --> 19:22.646
Why would Tara lie to me
about fucking other guys

19:22.720 --> 19:26.770
when we have a totally open and hedonistic
relationship that allows for behavior like that?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.082
Because people like to lie, Richard.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.609
It's a war of all against all.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.771
The history of humanity
is a book written in blood.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.522
We're all just animals in a pit.

19:39.920 --> 19:43.083
- I feel very sad.
- Fucking Gilfoyle.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.608
No, no. What are you doing?
Get back to work.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.160
On what?
You powered down all the computers.

19:50.240 --> 19:53.687
Use a notepad. Code on your phone.
We have a deadline here.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.724
No, Gavin, you have a deadline.

19:55.840 --> 19:58.411
We quit, like we should have done
the first time.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.251
What first time? What are you talking about?

20:00.320 --> 20:02.607
We both worked at Nucleus
right here in this room.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.927
Yeah, before you fired us and rehired us

20:05.000 --> 20:07.241
to do the exact same thing
without ever noticing.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.243
I invited you to my wedding, Gavin.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.166
Why?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.806
We just lost our key engineers.
What the hell do we do now?

20:16.880 --> 20:19.531
No one leaves this room until we figure it out.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.685
Thanks for the lift.

20:23.760 --> 20:26.286
Steve's place
is pretty far away from everything,

20:26.360 --> 20:28.840
but he's letting me stay on his couch for free,
so...

20:29.960 --> 20:32.327
And you were supposed to be my meal ticket.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.761
Yeah.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.764
Hold on. C.J. called.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.248
<i>Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know
about a great new story I'm chasing.</i>

20:40.320 --> 20:44.848
<i>It's a cautionary tale of two young
entrepreneurs who flew too close to the sun.</i>

20:44.920 --> 20:47.890
<i>I mean, apparently,
in the midst of losing millions,</i>

20:47.960 --> 20:49.928
<i>they threw a huge party they couldn't afford.</i>

20:50.000 --> 20:53.402
<i>I talked to two bartenders and a caterer
who worked your party the other night.</i>

20:53.520 --> 20:56.285
<i>None of them have been paid. Call me.</i>

20:56.840 --> 20:59.241
Well, it appears we've spent our last dime

20:59.360 --> 21:03.809
acquiring a tech blog
whose chief focus is chronicling our demise.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.204
Jian-Yang.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.364
<i>Erlich Bachman,
is your refrigerator running?</i>

21:09.680 --> 21:11.409
<i>This is Mike Hunt.</i>

21:13.720 --> 21:16.200
Oh, here, here it is on the right.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.766
Thanks, man.

21:19.880 --> 21:24.044
Hey, are you sure you're cool
with me taking both cannonballs?

21:25.280 --> 21:27.123
- I'm sure.
- Thanks, partner.

21:34.280 --> 21:35.611
I got it.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.082
I know you lied.

21:53.560 --> 21:55.244
- Sorry.
- What the fuck?

21:55.680 --> 21:57.284
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.089
How the hell did you know that I was here?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.367
Well, we have god-view on the beta,

22:01.440 --> 22:03.488
and I saw you leave your office
and come here.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.369
So you're stalking me?

22:05.440 --> 22:07.488
Look, Monica, I know you're lying
about not using the beta,

22:07.560 --> 22:10.040
so why haven't I heard from you?

22:10.440 --> 22:12.841
- Richard...
- No, it's okay.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.210
If you don't like it, you can say it.

22:15.720 --> 22:19.566
Everybody loves it, so I think I can handle
one negative review.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.285
Fine. I don't like it.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.840
Really? Are you serious?
Everybody else loves it.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.844
I've never wanted to
like something more in my life, Richard.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.685
- I just... I don't.
- Okay.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.047
What specifically do you not like about it?

22:36.040 --> 22:37.451
Specifically?

22:39.440 --> 22:41.249
All of it.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.530
I mean, it's not, it's not the UX or the design
or anything that you can tweak.

22:45.600 --> 22:49.571
It's just, the whole thing feels engineered.

22:50.080 --> 22:53.050
Okay. Well, that might make sense
because, um, I'm an engineer.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.646
Look, you've gotten
overwhelmingly positive feedback.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.530
The build is incredibly stable,
and you're out of money.

22:59.040 --> 23:03.921
So if you think it's ready, you should launch
and unlock the next $3 million.

23:04.640 --> 23:08.122
Look, Monica, I value your opinion,

23:08.280 --> 23:11.966
and you're the one that doesn't like it,
so I don't know.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.640
Richard, look.

23:16.440 --> 23:18.249
I passed on Slack.

23:19.640 --> 23:20.687
Really?

23:20.760 --> 23:23.650
I never told Laurie.
She'd probably fire me if she knew,

23:23.720 --> 23:28.487
but I had a chance to buy
20% of Slack for nothing, and I passed.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.004
I didn't get it. I still don't.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.686
I mean, what is it?
Is it email? Is it a chat room?

23:34.000 --> 23:37.083
Turns out, the answer is,
it's a $3-billion company.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.842
But that's the fucked-up thing
about what we do.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.649
Sometimes our opinion is wrong.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.722
And no matter how good something is,

23:43.800 --> 23:46.371
there's always gonna be someone
who doesn't get it.

23:47.040 --> 23:50.169
And unfortunately, with Pied Piper, it's me.

23:51.280 --> 23:52.281
Um...

23:52.760 --> 23:56.560
A week ago, I was worried
about releasing a beta no one would like.

23:57.280 --> 24:00.124
I'm just bummed
that you're the one that doesn't like it.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.646
Which is why you can't listen to anyone else.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.405
If you believe in something,

24:04.560 --> 24:07.370
don't let anyone talk you out of it,
including me.

24:08.800 --> 24:13.522
Peter Gregory always said,
"Don't invest in products, invest in people."

24:14.520 --> 24:16.602
I invested in you,

24:16.680 --> 24:18.921
and if you think it's ready to go,

24:19.000 --> 24:21.731
I will go to Laurie and fight like hell for it.

24:23.840 --> 24:25.808
So, what do you want to do?

24:29.040 --> 24:30.121
Congratulations, everyone.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.406
Yeah, I can't believe it.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.130
We're actually finally launching.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.720
Yes. Tuesday, 9:00 a.m.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.882
Pats on the back. Pats on the back.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.441
Gentlemen, I just realized
I've forgotten to take a shit.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.000
So, uh, I'll see you back at the old homestead.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.241
Okay.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.846
Laurie.

25:02.720 --> 25:05.690
I have a business proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.929
It's about my shares in Pied Piper.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.760
Okay, T minus five minutes.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.841
Dinesh, are you still
seriously squashing bugs?

25:18.920 --> 25:22.845
Not really. I'm so fucking tired,
I'm creating more than I'm fixing.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.649
Where the fuck is Gilfoyle?

25:26.520 --> 25:28.409
This isn't easy for me to do.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.448
You served me well, old friend.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.887
But we're transferring to AWS now,

25:38.360 --> 25:41.887
and I'm afraid you can't come.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.809
Oh, I'm pathetic?

25:49.400 --> 25:54.486
I'd rather have a bunch of fake friends
than be best friends with a fucking metal box.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.524
Can't you two see?

25:58.160 --> 25:59.844
You're each other's best friends.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.571
Fuck you, Jared.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.570
Yeah. Jinx.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.403
You owe each other a friendship.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.329
One minute. Holy shit.

26:11.040 --> 26:12.201
Holy shit.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.850
Excuse me. I gotta...

26:14.880 --> 26:17.167
- Hello?
- Hey, it's C.J.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.561
Uh, I just heard from the folks
that worked your party.

26:19.680 --> 26:22.923
- And?
- And it turns out they were paid in full.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.527
So apparently I owe you an apology,
and I feel bad.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.446
Not as bad as I feel, I can assure you.

26:30.680 --> 26:32.284
Yeah, I'm getting another call.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.401
Hello?

26:36.480 --> 26:39.529
<i>Erlich Bachman, this is your mom,</i>

26:39.600 --> 26:41.762
and you are not my baby.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.640
Not now, Jian-Yang! Not now!
Go back into your room!

26:48.040 --> 26:49.610
- Sorry.
-It's okay.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.361
Here we are, Erlich.

26:51.920 --> 26:53.410
Jobs and Woz, Woz and Jobs.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.448
I mean, we did it. You and me, man, forever.

26:56.520 --> 26:57.521
All right.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.524
Richard, never been more excited
to be proven wrong.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.567
Yeah, well, get ready
for your lives to change forever.

27:07.800 --> 27:13.842
Five, four, three, two, one...
