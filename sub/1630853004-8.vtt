WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.177
Previously onShining Vale...

00:03.264 --> 00:04.569
Take the pills
and I'll come inside you.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.310
Okay, Rosemary.

00:06.441 --> 00:08.443
I finished my book
on Adderall. Here you go.

00:08.573 --> 00:10.793
Fuck it.
I wanna throw a party--

00:10.923 --> 00:12.273
It's only weird
if you make it weird.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.318
Rosemary, I'm late for therapy.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.668
Oh, we canceled
because we're doing great.

00:16.799 --> 00:17.930
If this is a demon,

00:18.018 --> 00:19.454
you need to take care
of this now.

00:19.584 --> 00:21.238
But I thought
it was important

00:21.369 --> 00:24.111
that we know the competition.
What about that Blake fellow?

00:24.241 --> 00:25.329
I wouldn't mind
taking him home.

00:25.460 --> 00:27.984
What did you do?

00:28.115 --> 00:30.682
I just want us
to be a normal family.

00:30.813 --> 00:32.380
Terry, we're Phelps.
We can do anything.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.946
Aren't you an NPC?

00:34.077 --> 00:36.384
I'm Daisy.
I used to live here.

00:36.514 --> 00:37.907
My mom always wore
her necklace,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.778
but she wasn't wearing it
when she died.

00:39.909 --> 00:40.997
I'm not afraid of you.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.481
Okay.

00:46.568 --> 00:49.136
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.618
Oh, come on, man.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.887
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.282
Uh--

01:06.588 --> 01:08.155
Shit!

01:24.475 --> 01:26.173
Ah!

01:53.461 --> 01:54.984
-Shh!

01:55.115 --> 01:57.117
Roxy! Mommy's doing something!

01:57.247 --> 01:58.596
-Shh! Roxy!

02:03.688 --> 02:04.950
Mom, did you just kill Roxy?

02:08.171 --> 02:10.869
Honey, we have to
keep this a secret.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.046
You remember
how to keep a secret, right?

02:15.657 --> 02:17.528
Dad!

02:17.659 --> 02:20.227
Mom killed Roxy and is burying
her in the backyard--

02:20.357 --> 02:21.924
Oh, Jake!

02:23.621 --> 02:25.057
Are you fucking
kidding me?

02:28.452 --> 02:29.888
Gaynor... it's not
what you think.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.542
Really?

02:31.629 --> 02:33.196
Because I think you finally
fucking snapped,

02:33.283 --> 02:34.850
you crazy bit--

02:35.677 --> 02:37.374
Hey, thought
I heard you down here.

02:38.767 --> 02:40.160
Is that my shovel?

02:41.596 --> 02:43.075
Those our kids?

02:43.206 --> 02:44.642
Fuck it!

03:04.575 --> 03:06.360
Oh, my gosh.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.058
Roxy! You're alive!

03:13.671 --> 03:16.283
You do not fuck
with someone's dog!

03:18.894 --> 03:20.939
Wow, you really are just
a hairy spine.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.290
There you are. Whoa!

03:23.377 --> 03:25.205
I don't think I've ever seen
Roxy wet before.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.642
-Terry, I had
the worst dream last night.
-Yeah?

03:27.772 --> 03:29.600
I dreamt that you and Roxy
and the kids

03:29.731 --> 03:31.515
were all buried
in the backyard.

03:31.646 --> 03:33.604
And then when I woke up,
Roxy was covered in dirt.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.215
I-I thought you were dead.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.782
No, Roxy just got
in the plants and--wait.

03:37.913 --> 03:40.132
You thought
the kids and I were dead,

03:40.263 --> 03:41.308
but you stopped
to wash Roxy?

03:43.484 --> 03:44.702
She was really dirty.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.096
I...

03:47.183 --> 03:48.532
I'd like to talk to you
about last night.

03:48.663 --> 03:49.838
No, thanks. I'm good.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.536
I'm not. Something happened,

03:52.623 --> 03:56.323
and I wanna tell you about it.
I-I wrote it down, actually.

03:56.453 --> 04:00.283
I just wanna choose
my words very, very carefully.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.590
-Um...

04:02.720 --> 04:04.722
Uh, just "Pat... I--"

04:07.072 --> 04:08.857
"I am sad to report,
last night,

04:08.987 --> 04:11.468
I violated
our marriage covenant."

04:11.555 --> 04:13.296
-What the hell?
-I know.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.168
Just please let me
get through this, honey, okay?

04:16.299 --> 04:19.868
"Though much of the past year
has fluctuated from bad

04:19.998 --> 04:22.958
to really, really terrible,
I remain faithful and true."

04:23.088 --> 04:26.918
-Oh, no. God.
-Yes, it gets worse.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.529
-"Last night, fueled by
many cocktails..."

04:28.659 --> 04:30.270
Oh.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.577
"...and a general lack
of-of your sensitivity"--

04:33.708 --> 04:35.797
we've talked about--
"I shared a kiss

04:35.927 --> 04:38.495
with my co-worker,
Kathryn Dunn."

04:38.626 --> 04:39.931
-Holy fuck!
-I know.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.498
Listen, after
everything that happened

04:41.585 --> 04:43.195
last night, it was crazy.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.894
You know, I wanna earn
the trust back, okay?

04:45.981 --> 04:48.288
I wanna fight for this.
Tell me what to do.

04:48.418 --> 04:51.291
-Pat!
-What?

04:51.378 --> 04:53.902
We're good. I trust you.

04:56.644 --> 04:57.993
You're an amazing woman.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.691
No, no. I'm really not.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.258
-I have to go.
-Wow.

05:07.437 --> 05:08.960
Hey, Mom. You got a second?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.440
No, I really don't.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.181
Jesus,
I asked you for one second.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.444
And I told you,
I don't have time.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.098
Then don't act
like you fucking care.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.709
And those are my sneakers.
You crazy bitch.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.451
I don't think
you know who you're talking to.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.251
Hey, Mom, can I take
this sword to school?

05:39.382 --> 05:41.123
What? No.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.211
We're already on the list
because you brought in porn.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.517
Oh, Jake--

05:43.647 --> 05:44.909
Where are my fucking keys?

05:44.996 --> 05:46.650
That's not a sword.
That is an epee.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.479
I actually used it in college
when I fenced at Penn--

05:49.610 --> 05:50.524
I need it in case
Dan comes back.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.526
Dan? You got a bully?

05:52.656 --> 05:53.875
I'll teach you
the passata-sotto.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.877
This is Dan.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.750
Gimme that.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.361
Why can't you be normal?

06:01.491 --> 06:03.798
Whoa, whoa. Pat, take it easy.

06:06.148 --> 06:09.369
What?

06:09.456 --> 06:11.893
I'm so sorry, sweetie.
I'm so sorry.

06:13.503 --> 06:14.809
For what?

06:14.939 --> 06:16.419
I gotta go. I really gotta go.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.077
Okay, is it just me,

06:22.207 --> 06:24.340
or is Mom more batshit
than usual?

06:24.427 --> 06:25.472
Zeth, I got possessed.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.648
Wow. Okay. Who am I talking to?

06:27.778 --> 06:29.084
Pat Phelps.

06:29.171 --> 06:29.911
How many fucking
possessed women

06:30.041 --> 06:30.868
do you get in here?

06:30.999 --> 06:32.304
Slow it down.

06:32.435 --> 06:35.177
We're gonna talk
in calm, soothing tones.

06:35.307 --> 06:36.178
What happened
since I last saw you?

06:38.876 --> 06:42.140
I invited the demon
into my body.

06:42.271 --> 06:44.969
She threw a party,
did some blow,

06:45.056 --> 06:47.842
and fucked the shit
out of one of my guests...

06:47.972 --> 06:50.932
and uh, made some
kind of turkey jelly thing.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.108
Okay.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.805
Has she tried to physically
hurt you or any family members?

06:54.936 --> 06:57.852
She did have me out on a ledge.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.637
Oh, and the neighbor killed
herself on the--on our fence.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.509
And I found her necklace
in my drawer.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.380
Yep.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.860
Demons tend to collect
souvenirs from their victims.

07:05.990 --> 07:09.037
-Thought it was serial killers.
-Ha, ha, ha, ha.

07:09.167 --> 07:12.606
That is actually
what my novel is about.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.390
Poltergeist serial killer.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.393
In fact, and I hate to ask,
but would you mind writing

07:17.524 --> 07:18.960
a short little blurb
for the jacket?

07:19.090 --> 07:20.831
I'm not writing a blurb
for your fucking book.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.094
-I'm possessed!
-Mm?

07:23.225 --> 07:25.183
Okay, get rid of the demon,
and I'll give you a quote.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.359
Excellent.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.885
Okay, so, there's exorcism,
but you're gonna have to go

07:30.972 --> 07:32.452
through the Vatican,
and it takes about a year.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.018
I'll be a spider-walking
down the stairs by then.

07:34.149 --> 07:38.022
-What else?
-Um, demons need a host.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.242
Could destroy the vessel.

07:40.372 --> 07:41.591
Me being the vessel?

07:41.722 --> 07:43.419
Correct.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.290
So I have to kill myself?

07:45.421 --> 07:47.641
That, or you commit
to leading a clean, anxiety-,

07:47.771 --> 07:48.772
anger-, stress-,
and drug-free life--

07:48.903 --> 07:51.296
So I have to kill myself.

07:51.427 --> 07:53.516
I know she wants
to finish the book.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.300
-What if I let her do that?
-No, no, no, no.

07:55.387 --> 07:56.606
When you make a bargain
with a demon,

07:56.737 --> 07:58.347
if you hold up your end
of that bargain,

07:58.434 --> 08:00.480
they own you forever.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.611
So you're saying
that I'm fucked!

08:03.308 --> 08:07.922
There is...one thing
we could try.

08:13.014 --> 08:16.321
Evil stay away from me.

08:16.408 --> 08:19.020
-The enemy will surely flee.

08:19.150 --> 08:22.240
I gain protection and defense.

08:22.371 --> 08:25.417
Remove your wicked countenance!

08:29.291 --> 08:31.119
-Get out!
-What happened?

08:31.206 --> 08:32.163
Did I do that?

08:32.294 --> 08:34.122
Just get the fuck out!

08:34.252 --> 08:35.689
It could have been
so much worse.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.908
You didn't die. Yet.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.388
Just go!

08:43.435 --> 08:45.525
Okay, Demon.
Your story's over.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.095
Damn it.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.929
What are you doing, Patricia?

08:59.060 --> 09:02.759
We had a deal, and it is
not nice to break a promise.

09:02.890 --> 09:03.847
Well, you broke
my marriage

09:03.978 --> 09:05.240
and possibly my jaw,

09:05.370 --> 09:06.807
so I--I think we're even.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.202
Hi, Kam.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.247
Hey, Trish.
Is now a bad time?

09:12.377 --> 09:13.857
It-it couldn't be worse.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.772
Okay, well, I have
some really good news

09:15.903 --> 09:17.339
and some really bad news.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.036
What now?

09:19.167 --> 09:20.124
We want your book
for the summer.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.604
It's gonna be our big release.

09:21.735 --> 09:22.823
Oh, okay.
What's the good news?

09:24.302 --> 09:25.521
That is the good news.

09:25.608 --> 09:26.696
What happened to Claire's book?

09:26.827 --> 09:28.524
You know, it's so weird.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.440
The day after your party,
she slipped into a coma.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.967
-Oh, shit.
-I know.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.534
But you know, we have to be
practical about these things.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.797
It's what Claire
would've wanted. Maybe.

09:43.321 --> 09:45.933
Oh Kam, I'm sorry.
I can't--I can't do it.

09:46.063 --> 09:49.763
Don't pull a Pat on me.
My ass is on the line.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.155
Wait, are you wearing my shrug?

09:51.286 --> 09:52.461
God, I've been
looking for that.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.174
Fuck!

10:10.261 --> 10:12.524
Oh, you're so jumpy, Patricia.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.658
That's because someone
hasn't taken her medication.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.834
I'm not taking the drugs.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.968
So please get the fuck out
of my house and out of my body.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.797
And don't let the door
hit my ass on the way out.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.320
Don't do this, Patricia.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.148
Or, what?

10:27.278 --> 10:29.411
You can't kill me. You need me.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.457
So what are you gonna do?

10:32.588 --> 10:34.285
-You've got mail.
-Ooh.

10:37.419 --> 10:38.550
Oh.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.162
Terry, I swear it wasn't me!

10:41.292 --> 10:43.425
Really? It sure looks like you,

10:43.555 --> 10:44.905
except Blake's dick's
in your mouth.

10:45.035 --> 10:47.298
-I can explain that.
-Please do.

10:47.385 --> 10:48.996
You can start by telling me
how you managed to open

10:49.083 --> 10:51.651
your jaw like a cobra
when you told me you had TMJ.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.087
I paid for adult braces.

10:53.217 --> 10:56.177
I do have TMJ.
My jaw clicks. Listen!

10:59.441 --> 11:00.790
No, I can't hear a thing.

11:00.921 --> 11:01.835
You know what?
It-it doesn't matter.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.967
Terry, listen.

11:04.054 --> 11:08.102
I didn't wanna tell
you this, but there's a demon.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.756
Yeah, I know.
I'm looking right at her.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.627
Terry, please.

11:11.758 --> 11:15.326
Pat, it's over.
You destroyed everything.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.944
Hey, can I talk to you a sec?

11:24.074 --> 11:25.772
Why? Do you wanna
break up with me again?

11:25.902 --> 11:28.557
'Cause I got it when you
ghosted me, and then told me.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.950
I don't know,
maybe you post it?

11:30.080 --> 11:31.952
Look, I'm a dick. I'm sorry.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.084
It runs in my family.
What can I say? It's genetic.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.391
You don't even know
who you are, but I see you.

11:36.521 --> 11:39.394
You're kind and strong, and you
have so much love to give,

11:39.524 --> 11:41.004
but you give none
of it to yourself.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.485
Oh, my God.
That's not who I am at all.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.313
But that's really nice
of you to say.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.227
Yeah, well, I hope
your next boyfriend

11:46.357 --> 11:48.185
gets you more than I do.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.492
Wait, what?
You're breaking up with me?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.408
No, I'm moving.

11:53.495 --> 11:54.888
The real estate lady had, like,
three offers on the house

11:54.975 --> 11:56.846
by the time
I got back from the funeral.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.153
-Where are you going?
-I don't know.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.720
I got a pretty cool uncle
in LA.

12:00.850 --> 12:01.895
Might crash with him
for a while.

12:02.025 --> 12:03.461
Ugh, that's so awesome.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.943
Come with me.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.293
What? No, I can't.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.121
Why not?

12:11.252 --> 12:12.862
I don't know.
What would we do for money?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.211
I'm pretty sure
my parents would stop

12:14.342 --> 12:16.039
paying my credit card bill
after they found out

12:16.170 --> 12:18.259
I went to live with you and
your "pretty cool uncle in LA."

12:18.346 --> 12:19.695
I'm getting, like, a
million dollars from the house,

12:19.782 --> 12:20.870
plus, like, another half
a million from the trust fund.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.654
We could do whatever we want.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.656
Oh, my God.

12:24.787 --> 12:25.657
I'm in.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.052
Really?

12:29.139 --> 12:32.229
Yeah, let's get the fuck
outta Shining Vale.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.797
-I'm so happy.
-I might be pregnant.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.409
She had the affair with Frank

12:38.540 --> 12:41.021
because she was depressed,
but now she's happy.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.500
I mean, she's writing
her book again.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.502
She's--she had a party.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.069
It's like she's two
different people.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.331
I suspected
something was wrong

12:47.462 --> 12:49.072
when she canceled
our last session.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.726
She told me you canceled.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.728
It-it was Pat.
I have the voice mail.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.556
Okay, well, I'm gonna
ask you something,

12:54.686 --> 12:56.558
and I need you
to answer me honestly.

12:56.645 --> 12:58.212
Do I have to pay for that?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.040
We have a 72-hour
cancellation policy.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.477
Fuck.
This day keeps getting worse.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.087
This is Patricia Phelps.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.176
When a woman tells you
she is feeling depressed,

13:06.263 --> 13:07.743
listen to her.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.571
Don't just prescribe her
more medicine,

13:09.658 --> 13:11.573
you misogynistic little prick.

13:11.703 --> 13:14.097
We will not be coming in
today or ever.

13:14.228 --> 13:15.577
I'm going to kill us all.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.622
Oh, also we need
more Clonazepam.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.059
That's Pat? That's terrifying.

13:19.189 --> 13:21.888
That... doesn't
even sound like her.

13:22.018 --> 13:23.759
That's why I called for
a three-day psychiatric hold.

13:23.890 --> 13:24.716
What does that mean?

13:24.847 --> 13:25.979
It means she needs to be put

13:26.109 --> 13:27.981
into involuntary care
immediately.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.721
Why is this the first
I'm hearing about this?

13:29.852 --> 13:31.288
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.116
She's a danger to you
and your family.

13:33.203 --> 13:35.118
I'll let you know exactly
when I called it in.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.293
Oh, my God...

13:42.691 --> 13:43.648
Uh...

13:49.916 --> 13:51.569
My apologies, Terry.
It seems I forgot.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.400
You forgot to call in
a three-day psychiatric hold

13:56.531 --> 13:58.141
on my wife?

13:58.228 --> 13:59.186
It--it's been a very
stressful year for me--

13:59.316 --> 14:00.578
Holy shit!

14:00.709 --> 14:03.407
You are
the worst therapist ever.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.323
Hey, I'm not paying for that
last motherfucking session!

14:11.024 --> 14:12.895
What the fuck, Dad?

14:13.026 --> 14:14.288
You're driving worse
than usual.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.985
Gaynor, I don't have time
for this, okay?

14:16.116 --> 14:17.682
Listen, here's the deal.
Everything's fine.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.119
Okay? We're just gonna be
spending a few days

14:19.249 --> 14:20.903
at my parents' house.
All right?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.774
Wait, Doctor and Dr. Phelps
are gonna let us stay over?

14:22.905 --> 14:25.212
Uh, hope so.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.475
We'll--we'll call them
on the way. Stay here.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.346
I'm not going anywhere
without Roxy.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.261
You made that exceedingly clear
on the drive over.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.654
Everything's fine.

14:32.784 --> 14:33.873
I'm just gonna run over
to the house,

14:34.003 --> 14:34.874
I'm gonna get Roxy,
I'll bring her back.

14:35.004 --> 14:35.787
Everything will be fine.
It's fine.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.311
"Everything's fine"?

14:37.398 --> 14:38.399
Why do you keep saying
it's gonna be fine?

14:38.529 --> 14:39.661
'Cause it is!

14:44.274 --> 14:45.667
Lock the car, don't open
the doors or windows

14:45.797 --> 14:47.147
under any circumstances.

14:49.410 --> 14:50.411
Everything's fine!

14:54.806 --> 14:56.939
Why did you pick me?

14:57.070 --> 14:59.072
I mean, why not Gaynor?

14:59.202 --> 15:01.074
Not that I'm suggesting that.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.380
It's just, I'm way
past my possession years.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.253
'Cause I come alive
in your writing.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.908
Come on,

15:09.038 --> 15:10.779
that chapter with Blake?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.389
That was a real page-turner.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.870
Then why not Claire?
She's half my age.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.002
You could have gone
inside of her

15:16.132 --> 15:17.786
instead of putting her
in a coma.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.137
Sweetheart,
no one writes me like you do.

15:21.224 --> 15:24.184
What is so fucking important
about this book?

15:24.314 --> 15:26.316
By the way, I've read it.
It's not great.

15:26.447 --> 15:28.536
That's because
you don't know how we finish.

15:28.666 --> 15:31.669
Come, let me show you
how it ends.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.849
Roxy?

15:37.980 --> 15:40.417
Roxy?

15:45.466 --> 15:48.512
Roxy!

15:50.862 --> 15:52.734
Terry.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.823
Pat?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.407
Mom.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.148
You know I'm allergic to eggs,
Mom.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.105
You're not allergic to eggs,
you just don't like them--

16:16.236 --> 16:17.889
Coffee!

16:24.331 --> 16:26.681
Elijah,
you spilled the milk again.

16:41.609 --> 16:43.263
Roxy!

16:59.105 --> 17:04.197
No, that is you. That's not me.

17:04.284 --> 17:06.634
But we are
the same person, Patricia.

17:06.764 --> 17:10.551
Two strong women driven
to the brink by our families.

17:10.681 --> 17:12.988
There's one tiny difference.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.208
I'm not a psychopath.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.079
Haven't you ever thought
of killing your family?

17:17.210 --> 17:19.560
I'm a mother. Of course I have.

17:19.647 --> 17:23.607
Well, then just take
these pills,

17:23.738 --> 17:26.001
and we can finish
the job together.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.352
Oh, my God.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.051
Rosemary.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.012
I know there's
a mother inside of you

17:37.099 --> 17:40.842
that was angry, who was sad,

17:40.972 --> 17:42.757
that lost her shit.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.890
I get that.
I can relate, I promise you.

17:46.021 --> 17:48.763
And I am so sorry for you,

17:48.893 --> 17:51.853
but I will not kill my family.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.857
I've been trapped
inside this goddamn place

17:55.987 --> 17:58.555
for as long as I can remember.

17:58.686 --> 18:01.341
I need to move on.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.997
You are the only one
who's strong enough

18:06.085 --> 18:08.522
to take over.

18:08.652 --> 18:11.351
You made the deal.
You have no choice.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.311
Fuck you.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.101
I don't think you understand

18:22.188 --> 18:23.319
who you're dealing with.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.194
I don't think you understand
who you'redealing with.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.374
What are you doing?
That's too much.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.203
I'm destroying the vessel.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.470
Oh, Patricia,
that's revolting.

18:50.651 --> 18:52.261
Fucking Joan.

19:10.453 --> 19:13.239
I'm surprisingly bad
at taking pills.

19:13.369 --> 19:16.764
You could've gone out in style,

19:16.894 --> 19:20.594
but instead you're overdosing
like your mother.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.553
You asked me
to slaughter my family.

19:23.684 --> 19:25.990
That's a pretty big
fucking ask.

19:26.121 --> 19:29.342
Okay, well, then, new deal,
because no one likes

19:29.429 --> 19:31.561
to kill their children
or their pets.

19:31.692 --> 19:35.739
But husbands, they're the ones
who hold us back the most.

19:35.826 --> 19:38.307
We still have a window.
Come on, let's use it.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.353
I'm not gonna kill Terry.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.790
Nobody has been more supportive
than that poor guy.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.096
Oh, come on.

19:45.227 --> 19:48.970
That poor guy has been holding
you back your entire career.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.190
Terry didn't give me
writer's block.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.974
Didn't he?

19:53.104 --> 19:55.977
Your pen dried up as soon
as you got married,

19:56.107 --> 19:57.239
along with some other things.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.067
Because I had kids.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.505
Mm-hmm. Which he wanted.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.333
Think about it, Patricia.

20:04.464 --> 20:07.075
As soon as he thought
you were successful,

20:07.206 --> 20:10.339
he tried to fuck his secretary.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.472
She's not his secretary.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.038
He kissed her
and then told me about it.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.997
Let's face it.

20:16.127 --> 20:19.522
The only time you two
got along in this cursed house

20:19.653 --> 20:23.657
was when I was cooking
and cleaning for him.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.441
In fact, right now,

20:25.572 --> 20:28.227
he's trying
to sabotage your new book.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.229
Shut up.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.754
He's on the phone with Kam.

20:33.884 --> 20:38.280
Go on, pick up the extension.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.413
It doesn't work
that way, dumbass.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.331
Patricia.

20:47.202 --> 20:48.247
Patricia...

20:49.813 --> 20:51.162
Patricia.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.866
We have a lot of work to do,
Patricia.

21:03.218 --> 21:04.306
Hey.

21:04.437 --> 21:05.699
Kam, have you read Pat's book?

21:05.829 --> 21:07.875
Everything but
the ending.

21:08.005 --> 21:09.355
Well, I just read the ending.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.661
Ooh, is it good?

21:11.792 --> 21:15.709
"She chops up
her family with an axe."

21:15.839 --> 21:16.927
Can you send it to me?

21:18.755 --> 21:20.061
You gotta... She-

21:20.191 --> 21:22.759
Listen, you don't understand.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.196
I mean, she is out
of her fucking mind--

21:26.720 --> 21:28.287
Here's Patty.

21:30.071 --> 21:30.854
I'll call you back.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.293
What the fuck is taking
so long?

21:35.816 --> 21:36.947
Can I tell you
something personal?

21:37.078 --> 21:38.471
It's not pervy, is it?

21:38.601 --> 21:40.429
No. Can you just
roll up the window?

21:40.560 --> 21:42.126
I don't want other people
to hear it.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.392
What's going on, bud?

21:52.006 --> 21:53.616
-Oh, my gosh!

21:53.747 --> 21:56.880
Ew! So fucking gross.

21:57.011 --> 21:58.969
You don't hotbox your sister!

21:59.100 --> 22:03.496
-Sorry. I'm bored.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.367
She's back.

22:09.632 --> 22:10.894
Run!

22:12.069 --> 22:12.548
Where are you going?
Dad said not to leave.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.289
Daisy said to run.

22:14.420 --> 22:15.421
I'm not getting
in trouble for you!

22:16.813 --> 22:18.772
Roxy!

22:18.902 --> 22:21.340
So... what'd you
think of the book?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.907
To be totally honest,
I didn't love it.

22:24.038 --> 22:24.952
Hmm.

22:26.954 --> 22:30.523
Hey, we're gonna put
that axe down right now, okay?

22:30.610 --> 22:31.959
And we're gonna sit down
and we're just gonna talk

22:32.089 --> 22:33.264
about this, okay?

22:36.964 --> 22:38.487
Okay.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.449
Holy fuck!

22:43.536 --> 22:44.754
Pat,
that's a load-bearing beam!

22:44.885 --> 22:45.973
Crazy...

22:49.846 --> 22:52.588
Roxy! Where are you?

22:52.719 --> 22:54.503
-Roxy!

22:56.723 --> 22:57.811
Hey sweetie.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.943
What are you doing?

23:00.074 --> 23:01.075
You're gonna get dirty,
and no one likes cleaning you.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.210
What the fuck?

23:16.525 --> 23:18.005
God...

23:20.747 --> 23:22.879
Mom? Mom!

23:26.056 --> 23:27.406
What is it, sweetie?

23:27.536 --> 23:28.319
Mom?

23:30.539 --> 23:31.932
Remember that girl
from the video game?

23:32.062 --> 23:33.803
She said her name is Daisy.

23:33.934 --> 23:36.545
She used to live here,
but her mom killed her.

23:36.676 --> 23:37.938
Her mom came back,
but Daisy says

23:38.068 --> 23:39.679
there is one way
we can stop her.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.029
-Mom?

23:42.159 --> 23:43.552
Roxy!

23:43.683 --> 23:45.511
Hey, sweetie,
you're on your own.

23:47.338 --> 23:49.079
Where are you going, Terry?

23:49.166 --> 23:51.604
Pat, put down the axe, okay?

23:51.734 --> 23:53.127
I don't want somebody
to get hurt.

23:53.257 --> 23:55.346
I'm not gonna hurt you.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.653
I'm just gonna chop
your legs off.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.003
Right, well,
I think that would hurt.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.962
-Go.
-Hey.

24:03.137 --> 24:07.315
I spoke to Dr. Berg, okay?
And not that it matters,

24:07.446 --> 24:09.404
but he's not gonna charge us
for that missed session.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.668
I think maybe you should
be taken to a hospital.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.278
-So when do you think maybe
-Dammit.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.629
I should go to the hospital?

24:16.759 --> 24:19.370
-As soon as possible.
-"As soon as possible"?

24:19.501 --> 24:23.549
Hey, I know you're high, Pat.
I found the drugs, okay?

24:23.679 --> 24:25.986
Just gonna--we're gonna
get you help. Okay?

24:26.116 --> 24:28.858
I forgive you for everything.
For Blake, everything.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.470
-You forgiveme?
-Goddamn it!

24:31.600 --> 24:33.907
Has it ever occurred to you

24:34.037 --> 24:38.477
what it feels like
to always be forgiven?

24:38.607 --> 24:40.740
I'm guessing by the crazed look
in your eyes, not great.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.220
No, it's not fucking great,
Terry.

24:44.744 --> 24:47.050
You set an impossible standard

24:47.181 --> 24:48.835
for what it means
to be a spouse.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.838
I cheated on you,
and you bought me

24:51.925 --> 24:53.709
a fucking mansion
in Connecticut.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.102
Because I wanted you
to be happy!

24:55.232 --> 24:56.973
I can't be happy!

24:57.104 --> 24:59.628
You can, Pat. We can.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.717
We were happy before.
We can be happy again.

25:01.848 --> 25:05.416
Stop being so patient.
It's exhausting!

25:05.504 --> 25:07.941
I fucked a random guy

25:08.028 --> 25:10.421
in a car that I bought
with your credit card.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.904
Do something!

25:25.567 --> 25:27.351
That's a direct hit.
In fencing, that'd be my point.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.752
Oh, my God.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.886
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

25:39.973 --> 25:43.629
Terry, Terry, I'm so sorry.
That wasn't me.

25:43.759 --> 25:46.501
Terry, please wake up.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.895
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:50.157 --> 25:51.854
Why is my godmother's necklace
buried in the backyard?

25:53.334 --> 25:54.727
And why is Dad dead?

25:58.731 --> 26:01.342
He--he's alive. Gaynor--

26:01.472 --> 26:04.301
Hey, don't you
fucking touch me.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.955
I don't have much time.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.524
I know I haven't been
the best mother--

26:09.655 --> 26:10.830
You've literally been
the worst mother.

26:12.614 --> 26:13.963
Fuck it!

26:15.269 --> 26:16.575
Mom!

26:40.468 --> 26:41.730
Why do I have to go
to a new school?

26:41.861 --> 26:43.253
It's not fair.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.952
'Cause this is a school
for smart people,

26:46.082 --> 26:47.736
-and you are smart.
-Am I smart?

26:47.867 --> 26:49.956
What? You are amazing!

26:51.566 --> 26:53.263
What if I can't handle it?

26:53.350 --> 26:54.917
Wait a second, Gaynor.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.093
What was that word I heard?
Huh?

26:57.224 --> 27:01.663
"What if I--coconut?"
Is that what I heard? Hmm?

27:01.794 --> 27:03.099
Jake, what did you hear?

27:03.230 --> 27:05.536
"What if I Corn Nut?"
I don't know that word.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.408
We don't know that--do
we know that word, "can't?"

27:07.538 --> 27:09.802
No, we can do anything, guys.
You know why?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.586
I'll tell you why. We--

27:11.717 --> 27:15.764
Are Phelps.
We are Phelps.

27:15.895 --> 27:19.289
We are Phelps.
We are Phelps.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.987
To the beat, Dad.

27:21.117 --> 27:24.338
We are Phelps! We are
Phelps! We are Phelps!

27:24.468 --> 27:26.340
We are Phelps! We are...

27:26.470 --> 27:29.125
Mrs. Phelps. Mrs. Phelps.
Mrs. Phelps.

27:31.388 --> 27:34.174
Mrs. Phelps? Mrs. Phelps?

27:35.523 --> 27:37.351
What's--where am I?

27:37.481 --> 27:39.962
You're in the Shining Vale
psychiatric hospital.

27:40.049 --> 27:43.923
No, I'm not crazy.
There--there's a mistake.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.751
You overdosed
on expired barbiturates.

27:45.881 --> 27:48.231
What? Wait!
Those are my mother's.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.538
There was a ghost.
There's a demon!

27:50.625 --> 27:54.585
Gaynor! Gaynor!

27:54.716 --> 27:58.154
-Tell them I'm not crazy.
-It's okay, Mom.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.895
They're just gonna take care
of you for a little while.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.987
Don't do this to me.
Don't do this to me.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.685
I'm possessed!

28:06.815 --> 28:08.512
I'm not crazy!

28:08.643 --> 28:09.992
Are we gonna be okay?

28:10.079 --> 28:11.472
This can't happen to me.

28:11.602 --> 28:13.953
Yeah. We are Phelps.

28:14.083 --> 28:17.304
Gaynor, I'm not fucking crazy!

28:17.434 --> 28:19.306
Gaynor!

28:19.436 --> 28:21.351
Gaynor.

28:24.224 --> 28:25.486
It's okay.
It's okay.

28:27.618 --> 28:29.142
Don't you touch me!

28:32.188 --> 28:33.799
Don't you touch me!

28:33.929 --> 28:35.539
That's my house.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.414
Hello? That's my house.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.214
Welcome home.
