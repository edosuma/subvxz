01:18.000 --> 01:21.119
Awful soft dirt in here.
Make sure you shore it up good.

01:25.132 --> 01:28.500
It's like working inside a cow down here.

01:28.593 --> 01:34.298
Una vaca plata
that is going to pay off my ranch.

01:34.391 --> 01:37.060
Your ranch.

01:37.143 --> 01:40.476
It's like a woman.
It's all you ever talk about.

01:40.563 --> 01:43.647
Meanwhile, she's taking all your money.

01:43.733 --> 01:47.232
And you, you spend
all of your money on whiskey.

01:47.654 --> 01:50.144
But you're going to miss me soon.

01:55.286 --> 01:57.159
Victor?

02:08.383 --> 02:10.256
Victor?

02:20.103 --> 02:21.929
Jefe. Jefe.

02:22.022 --> 02:24.429
Jefe, Victor is gone.

02:24.524 --> 02:28.355
- What do you mean, "gone"?
- We were working the face.

02:28.445 --> 02:30.935
I know he couldn't have got past me.

02:31.031 --> 02:34.234
But now he's just gone.

02:34.326 --> 02:36.484
Jefe! Jefe!

02:39.205 --> 02:41.826
Aaaaargh!

02:41.916 --> 02:44.786
Dammit.

02:48.506 --> 02:50.996
Juan! Where are ya?

04:20.389 --> 04:23.093
So many people leaving.

04:24.310 --> 04:26.468
Is everyone rejecting us?

04:26.562 --> 04:30.476
No, Fu Yien. They are leaving
because the mine is closed.

04:32.985 --> 04:35.558
Maybe we need a different name.

04:37.573 --> 04:41.819
- Perhaps it was not the best choice, huh?
- Maybe not.

04:41.910 --> 04:43.949
Son...

04:59.928 --> 05:05.633
Juan Pedilla, you've been looking at
that hat for a month. Buy it or don't buy it.

05:05.725 --> 05:07.847
No, no. I can't afford it.

05:07.936 --> 05:10.094
You take it on credit. Pay us later.

05:10.188 --> 05:12.061
No credit!

05:12.148 --> 05:15.065
Stan Kelton is leaving.
Loading up his wagon.

05:15.151 --> 05:19.445
Stan too? Now we're a town
without a blacksmith.

05:19.532 --> 05:23.399
It'll end up as a ghost town
if that mine doesn't reopen.

05:23.494 --> 05:26.198
If everybody leaves,
who will buy our things?

05:26.288 --> 05:29.573
No one.
And we'll go back to China.

05:29.667 --> 05:33.996
Only way you going back to China
is if you learn how to swim.

05:37.758 --> 05:39.584
What does I Ching say?

05:39.676 --> 05:43.424
"Expect arrival of great conqueror."

05:52.689 --> 05:59.272
The mine will not stay closed. That ore is
turning out a hundred ounces to the ton.

05:59.362 --> 06:02.446
- Two hundred, my friend.
- Two hundred?

06:02.532 --> 06:06.399
Well, nobody's walking away
from riches like that.

06:06.494 --> 06:08.285
Nobody.

06:08.371 --> 06:12.499
Well, if you saw what I saw,
you might walk away.

06:12.584 --> 06:15.501
You never really told us what you saw.

06:15.587 --> 06:17.745
I saw nothing.

06:17.839 --> 06:21.753
But the nothing, it was worse
than anything I have ever seen.

06:21.843 --> 06:24.678
You're not thinking of pulling out too?

06:24.762 --> 06:26.920
No, I cannot do that.

06:27.015 --> 06:30.430
- I would lose everything, like you.
- Like all of us.

06:30.518 --> 06:33.269
Listen. It's about the mine.

06:33.354 --> 06:37.683
The owner of the mine is coming.
All the way from Philadelphia.

06:37.775 --> 06:41.143
He say "Low profit
from mine unacceptable."

06:41.237 --> 06:43.609
"Proceeding with all dispatch."

06:43.698 --> 06:48.075
"Will take matters into hand personally.
Signed, Hiram Gummer."

06:48.160 --> 06:50.733
That's a real two-dollar name.

06:50.830 --> 06:56.785
I'll wager he gets this thing solved faster
than a bee with a horse on its tail. Betcha.

07:23.237 --> 07:26.356
The stage is coming! It's coming!

07:31.287 --> 07:35.236
Tecopa! Miss Christine!
The stage, it's coming!

08:04.570 --> 08:07.606
- What do you think he looks like?
- He's probably fat.

08:07.698 --> 08:09.856
Rich people are always fat.

08:11.368 --> 08:13.407
Oh, my word.

08:13.495 --> 08:16.614
- Anybody in there?
- It's full of luggage.

08:25.257 --> 08:27.664
- It's about time.
- Indeed it is.

08:27.759 --> 08:30.047
- Let me in.
- Can't wait to leave this place.

08:32.222 --> 08:34.510
No one got out.

08:54.161 --> 08:56.734
Mr. Hiram Gummer?

08:58.165 --> 08:59.872
I am he.

08:59.959 --> 09:03.541
I am Tsang Pyong Lien.
Pyong Chang.

09:03.629 --> 09:06.416
This is my market.

09:06.507 --> 09:08.879
- You're not very fat.
- Quiet!

09:08.967 --> 09:10.247
Whooee.

09:10.344 --> 09:14.673
You must have enough money
to burn a wet mule, huh?

09:14.765 --> 09:18.632
Mr. Gummer, I'm Christine Lord.
Proprietress of the local hotel.

09:18.727 --> 09:21.015
You're lovelier than Fifth Avenue in spring.

09:21.104 --> 09:24.021
- Welcome to Rejection.
- Aptly named, it would seem.

09:24.107 --> 09:29.730
I'm here to see Andrew Beckwith. I've sent
him three communiqués, all unanswered.

09:29.821 --> 09:33.521
- I want to speak to him forthwith.
- That might prove difficult.

09:33.617 --> 09:37.448
- Why? Where is he?
- On that. The last stage out of here.

09:37.537 --> 09:39.410
Wh?

09:40.623 --> 09:45.450
- That's just dandy. The last?
- Too few passengers.

09:45.545 --> 09:49.756
The mine closed several weeks ago.
That is why you're here, isn't it?

09:49.841 --> 09:56.092
Closed? The mine closed? I feel I've not
been privy to most needful information.

09:56.180 --> 09:58.670
You don't know
what happens at the mine?

09:58.766 --> 10:03.178
17 miners were killed in one day.
The workers abandoned it.

10:03.271 --> 10:04.895
17? What on earth happened?

10:04.981 --> 10:07.472
- No one knows.
- Must you speak in riddles?

10:07.568 --> 10:11.779
- The only one who knows is Juan Pedilla.
- Then I must see him straightaway.

10:11.864 --> 10:15.908
Well, he's out riding his land.
We expect him back shortly. Please.

10:15.993 --> 10:19.824
You must be tired from your traveling.
Let me show you to the hotel.

10:19.913 --> 10:24.574
Oh, very well.
Come, I'll need assistance with my kit.

10:29.005 --> 10:32.539
This is our bank. Closed, of course.

10:34.010 --> 10:37.176
Our blacksmith, also closed.

10:37.263 --> 10:39.054
- And our post office.
- Closed.

10:39.140 --> 10:42.555
- Of course.
- Quite the bustling metropolis.

10:47.398 --> 10:52.024
- "Great conqueror".
- And this is my hotel. Welcome.

11:00.370 --> 11:02.777
Right this way.

11:05.833 --> 11:09.248
An impressive arsenal.
Are you a collector?

11:09.337 --> 11:12.006
The miners came west to strike it rich.

11:12.089 --> 11:17.675
When it came time to settle their bills,
many of them had only their firearms left.

11:17.762 --> 11:23.432
- Now I collect payments daily.
- Nonsense. Just keep a running tab.

11:27.396 --> 11:30.147
Your man is rather impudent.

11:30.232 --> 11:33.435
Tecopa is not my "man". He is my friend.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.406
But this is a tent.

11:44.497 --> 11:46.987
Yes. You're observant.
Which would you like?

11:47.083 --> 11:50.748
This one right here.

11:50.837 --> 11:53.292
Dandy.
What time will luncheon be served?

11:53.381 --> 11:57.248
Well, since the mine has closed
the supply wagons have stopped,

11:57.343 --> 12:01.126
so our menu's a bit limited.
I could fix you a pot of beans.

12:02.765 --> 12:08.103
Nonsense. Surely you have flour,
molasses and ginger?

12:08.187 --> 12:12.599
I should like a gingerbread cake.
Yes, that should do nicely.

12:14.694 --> 12:18.027
You want me to strangle him?

12:18.114 --> 12:20.604
No, we need him.

12:28.541 --> 12:34.164
Delightful music and a passable meal.
Which I should like to end with an aperitif.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.542
Wouldn't we all?

12:38.008 --> 12:41.423
Fu Yien, would you like
that last piece of gingerbread?

12:41.512 --> 12:42.460
Yes.

12:42.554 --> 12:46.931
Then go to my small carpet bag, the blue
one, and fetch my bottle of peach brandy.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.092
Yes, sir.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.415
- What happened to the gingerbread?
- I ate it, of course.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.416
- But you said I could...
- A word of advice, young man.

13:14.502 --> 13:19.841
Anyone can be taken advantage of,
and if you can, do.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.213
That is terrible advice to give a child.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.549
The boy must learn
the ways of the world.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.312
I assure you, he knows them.

13:32.396 --> 13:35.396
- Juan's here. He's over at the store.
- "Juan"?

13:35.482 --> 13:38.518
Juan Pedilla, the miner.

13:38.610 --> 13:41.065
Oh. Yes, yes.

13:42.573 --> 13:45.988
No, no, no, no.
The mine is not played out. Not at all.

13:46.076 --> 13:50.821
There's plenty more silver in there.
It's just no one wants to go in and get it.

13:50.914 --> 13:54.365
Seven more men go up since accident.
None come back.

13:54.459 --> 13:58.587
My ancestors talked of spirit beasts
that live inside those mountains.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.834
"Spirit beasts"?

13:59.923 --> 14:03.505
Beasts from the underworld.
Blind to all but killing.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.677
Have you all taken leave of your senses?

14:08.765 --> 14:15.301
Juan, gather up the remaining miners,
hunt down whatever is doing this...

14:15.397 --> 14:20.189
And fill 'em full of more holes
than a cabbage leaf in a hailstorm.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.355
Precisely.

14:21.444 --> 14:27.030
Señor Gummer, there are some miners
camped north of town. I can talk to them.

14:27.116 --> 14:32.702
But they are not going to go back unless
you pay them. Maybe even double wages.

14:32.789 --> 14:39.206
- Pay them? To earn their own jobs back?
- I'm just telling you, they are scared.

14:39.295 --> 14:44.799
Very well. To ensure my resources are not
squandered by this cabal of hooligans,

14:44.884 --> 14:48.134
I shall accompany you myself,
first thing in the morning.

14:48.220 --> 14:53.759
Now you're talking. What kind of gun
did you bring? Betcha it's big and fancy.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.224
I don't own a firearm.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.396
Yes?

15:08.074 --> 15:13.031
This is the Wild West, Mr. Gummer.
You don't read the dime novels?

15:13.121 --> 15:15.908
You see a bad guy,
you gotta smoke him up.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.965
Señor Gummer, your horse is ready.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.169
Señor Gummer...

15:32.265 --> 15:34.340
Morning.

15:37.395 --> 15:42.555
Señor, it is a hard day's ride
over very rough country. Uh...

15:42.650 --> 15:47.940
This is the cross-country model.
The horse can carry my kit. Off we go!

16:03.337 --> 16:05.910
Deplorable road conditions.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.835
Um...

16:11.887 --> 16:13.926
No, no, I'd like some, uh...

16:14.014 --> 16:17.347
Maybe just... Thank you.
Ah, very good.

16:21.104 --> 16:25.979
I haven't been on a horse since I...
since my sixth birthday party.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.641
No, actually, that was a camel.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.909
- Mr. Gummer?
- Yes?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.905
- This is for you.
- I beg your pardon?

16:38.998 --> 16:43.042
This is the Wild West. Never go unarmed.

16:43.210 --> 16:47.955
No, indeed, um...
Thank you, son. Thank you.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.670
You really think
he is "great conqueror"?

16:53.763 --> 16:56.432
Only if he rides a camel
better than he rides a horse.

16:56.515 --> 17:01.722
Let's not judge yet, Tecopa.
He's the only chance we have.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.781
Howdy, gents.

17:35.512 --> 17:40.423
- This is our army?
- These are the only ones willing to go.

17:41.476 --> 17:44.809
All the better.
No need to waste my money on cowards.

17:44.896 --> 17:47.980
Men, this is the patrón,
Mr. Hiram Gummer.

17:48.066 --> 17:51.269
These are the Walter brothers,
Brick and Stony.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.196
- This is Big Horse Johnson.
- Mr. Johnson.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.568
And this is Soggy.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.365
Soggy?

18:00.745 --> 18:02.986
Indeed.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.541
Well, in you go.

18:14.635 --> 18:18.335
- And what?
- And report back to me.

18:21.933 --> 18:24.684
Oh, very well.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.470
As none of you possess
sufficient leadership skills,

18:28.565 --> 18:32.183
I shall supervise the endeavor myself.
Juan?

18:34.362 --> 18:36.437
Vámonos.

19:00.471 --> 19:03.970
- Wait.
- That was our foreman.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.343
My hat.

19:11.107 --> 19:12.269
Urgh.

19:16.612 --> 19:19.067
Here. He ain't gonna need it.

19:20.199 --> 19:22.487
Try it on.

19:25.621 --> 19:27.909
Thank you,jefe.

19:44.557 --> 19:46.632
Oh, my.

19:53.775 --> 19:58.152
This is the end of the mine,
where Victor was.

19:58.237 --> 20:01.985
Well, we're still alive.

20:02.075 --> 20:06.238
Whatever attacked you,
it would seem to be gone.

20:15.421 --> 20:18.256
Gentlemen,
I declare this mine perfectly safe.

20:18.341 --> 20:21.128
Dang right.
Ain't nothin' in there but ghosts.

20:21.218 --> 20:23.708
You don't need to pay them no wages.

20:23.804 --> 20:26.508
I pray that we are correct.

20:32.521 --> 20:36.767
Well, sun's gettin' low.
Might as well set up camp.

20:40.446 --> 20:43.019
We can't camp here.

20:46.118 --> 20:47.991
I need trees.

21:05.679 --> 21:08.596
It's better for the posture.

21:24.073 --> 21:27.488
Oh, damn.
You gonna start torturing that thing?

21:27.576 --> 21:29.983
Helps me sleep.

21:32.122 --> 21:36.368
- And the horses like it too.
- Well, go play it for them.

21:40.172 --> 21:42.544
Ain't my fault you lack a musical ear.

21:56.313 --> 21:59.148
How soon do you think
you can reopen the mine?

21:59.232 --> 22:03.181
Posthaste. The sooner the better.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.902
Good.

22:04.988 --> 22:09.982
Because I need to keep working
if I don't want to lose my ranch.

22:10.076 --> 22:12.531
I thought you were a miner.

22:12.621 --> 22:19.418
Well, I am a miner, but my father always
dreamed of having a ranch for us one day.

22:19.502 --> 22:21.209
And?

22:21.296 --> 22:26.337
He was killed in a cave-in
when I was a boy.

22:26.426 --> 22:31.586
My mother, she moved us
from mining camp to mining camp.

22:31.681 --> 22:37.683
They always need a woman
to do the laundry and the cooking.

22:37.770 --> 22:40.521
I've been without my cook for weeks.

22:44.861 --> 22:48.312
You always had everything, didn't you?

22:48.406 --> 22:50.943
Several of everything.

22:52.493 --> 22:54.781
I'd just like to get one of something.

22:54.870 --> 22:58.239
What on earth?

23:08.885 --> 23:12.550
Aw, damn.
We'll be hours finding them horses.

23:12.639 --> 23:15.212
Soggy, you sorry sack!

23:18.770 --> 23:21.474
- I'm gonna pound you blue!
- Easy, everybody.

23:21.564 --> 23:25.810
You pound 'im, Brick!
Aw, he's always fartin' around.

23:28.029 --> 23:30.733
Where the hell are you?

23:32.700 --> 23:34.573
It won't do you no good hidin'!

23:34.661 --> 23:36.700
¡Cállate!

23:38.581 --> 23:41.368
You hear that?

23:41.459 --> 23:43.202
Soggy!

23:43.294 --> 23:46.912
The longer I look, the madder I get!

23:47.006 --> 23:48.713
Aaargh!

23:48.799 --> 23:51.550
- Good Lord! What the?
- Tarnation!

23:55.056 --> 23:57.926
Brick? You all right?

23:58.017 --> 24:01.136
Stony, don't you go
shooting blind out there!

24:01.770 --> 24:03.809
Brick!

24:03.898 --> 24:05.937
Well, where is he?

24:06.025 --> 24:08.515
Don't know. He ain't out there.

24:10.779 --> 24:12.854
Who's there?

24:13.949 --> 24:18.278
Who's over there?
We've got guns over here.

24:37.056 --> 24:39.178
Wh... wh...

24:39.267 --> 24:41.936
What in God's name?

25:05.751 --> 25:08.206
You gotta shoot faster! Kill them, man!

25:19.598 --> 25:21.923
- We gotta get up somewhere!
- Where?

25:22.017 --> 25:24.342
Over on that rock!

25:33.236 --> 25:37.399
Señor Gummer!
Over here on the rock! On the rock!

25:38.909 --> 25:42.823
Big Horse! Over here!
You gotta get off the ground!

25:43.830 --> 25:46.237
Big Horse! Here!

25:48.251 --> 25:52.711
- No! Big Horse, you can't shoot it!
- This way, man! Quickly!

25:52.797 --> 25:55.548
Get on the rock!

26:26.623 --> 26:29.113
Good heavens.

26:29.209 --> 26:31.782
What a dreadful odor.

26:33.922 --> 26:36.294
I smelled it in the mine.

26:36.383 --> 26:39.383
It was them.

26:39.469 --> 26:42.386
They came up through the soft dirt.

26:42.472 --> 26:45.259
At least it can't penetrate rock.

26:57.278 --> 26:59.947
It has no eyes.

27:03.368 --> 27:06.404
How did they find us?

27:18.758 --> 27:23.799
It's the sound. Every time
we made a sound. Even your teapot.

27:23.888 --> 27:26.295
That's how they hunt.

27:30.644 --> 27:34.059
We can't just stay here.

27:35.649 --> 27:41.484
These foothills are made of rock. We can
walk on them all the way to Rejection.

27:41.572 --> 27:45.072
- Walk?
- Well, unless you can fly.

28:16.774 --> 28:19.525
Tecopa, what are you doing?

28:20.570 --> 28:22.645
Diggin' a spot for a flagpole.

28:22.738 --> 28:28.076
A flagpole? Does it concern you
that Nevada hasn't yet adopted a flag?

28:28.160 --> 28:31.825
We will one day. I'll be ready.

28:49.139 --> 28:54.215
They're back! They're back!
It's Juan and Mr. Gummer! They're back!

28:55.854 --> 28:58.427
I'd have walked twice that far to get away.

28:58.523 --> 29:01.476
Those are the most savagerous beasts
I've ever seen.

29:01.568 --> 29:05.565
Well, didn't you let loose?
Let fly? Barrels blazing?

29:05.655 --> 29:08.739
Old Fred, you don't understand.

29:08.825 --> 29:14.245
When they're not underground,
they're... flying. Very fast.

29:15.832 --> 29:19.581
- Dragons. Dirt dragons.
- We never had them in China.

29:19.670 --> 29:23.584
Big Horse, Juan -
they tried to shoot them but couldn't.

29:23.674 --> 29:27.837
You'd have to be
an unparalleled shootist.

29:27.928 --> 29:32.424
But wait, that's it. A telegram.
We must send a telegram immediately.

29:32.516 --> 29:34.674
Let me do it. I know how.

29:34.768 --> 29:35.847
Here.

29:35.936 --> 29:39.684
"Wanted - gunfighter."

29:39.773 --> 29:44.933
"Town of Rejection, Nevada,
seeks experienced quick-draw artist,

29:45.029 --> 29:47.698
calm in face of danger."

29:47.781 --> 29:50.188
"Salary negotiable."

29:50.284 --> 29:55.360
Send that to the Territorial Enterprise,
the Denver Post and the Wichita Eagle.

29:55.455 --> 30:00.033
- You're going to hire a gunfighter?
- I think that is a good idea.

30:01.753 --> 30:06.082
But is it wise?
A gunfighter's usually mean, wild...

30:07.426 --> 30:09.632
Drink, shoot inside house...

30:09.719 --> 30:14.464
- But we need someone with fortitude.
- Someone with a little fan in their craw.

30:14.558 --> 30:17.808
Exactly. Someone who is
proficient with firearms who can...

30:17.894 --> 30:20.930
Shoot the nuts off a squirrel
at a hundred paces.

30:21.022 --> 30:23.809
- Thank you.
- Someone like Doc Holliday.

30:23.900 --> 30:29.274
- Except one that ain't dead.
- Doc Holliday's dead?

30:29.364 --> 30:31.901
OK, it's done.

30:31.991 --> 30:34.481
Now we wait.

30:44.003 --> 30:46.873
- Handsome, no?
- Oh, very.

30:46.964 --> 30:49.419
It's me.

30:49.509 --> 30:52.046
Very few men have statues of themselves.

30:52.136 --> 30:54.923
A cigar-store Indian?

30:55.014 --> 30:59.261
Oh, a salesman gave that to me
when he couldn't pay his bill.

30:59.353 --> 31:02.686
Well, it could be me.

31:33.344 --> 31:37.887
- Mr. Gummer, I fixed your wheel.
- Impossible, it's a complete loss.

31:37.974 --> 31:39.218
Nope.

31:47.066 --> 31:50.185
Well, I... My, my, that's...

31:52.989 --> 31:57.900
Remarkable. Um... Thank you.
Thank you very much.

31:57.994 --> 32:00.829
That'll be five dollars, please.

32:00.913 --> 32:05.206
Now listen here. No workman
would dare ask more than two bits.

32:05.292 --> 32:09.585
I'm the only wheel-fixer in town.
No one else till Carson City.

32:09.672 --> 32:13.716
- But that's highway robbery.
- A word of advice, Mr. Gummer.

32:13.801 --> 32:18.047
Anyone can be taken advantage of.
And if you can, do.

32:27.648 --> 32:33.235
Fu Yien, I'm a trifle short of cash
at present. May we barter instead?

32:34.489 --> 32:38.438
For services rendered,
you may have the bicycle.

32:38.534 --> 32:41.534
It's yours.
I'm becoming quite the expert horseman.

32:41.621 --> 32:44.028
Dandy, Mr. Gummer!

32:46.918 --> 32:48.993
There you go.

32:50.504 --> 32:52.461
No, um...
Oh, here, here, here, here.

32:52.548 --> 32:54.789
I'll steady you. Get your balance.

32:54.884 --> 33:01.218
Now, when I push, press the pedals
and keep the front wheel straight. Ready?

33:01.307 --> 33:03.133
Off you go.

33:10.316 --> 33:11.940
Not bad.

33:16.196 --> 33:18.817
Not bad at all.

33:41.138 --> 33:43.628
How long is this bedlam to last?

33:43.723 --> 33:47.720
Oh, a few more days.
We're deepening our well.

33:47.811 --> 33:52.354
We're quite proud of our engine. It's going
to run our electric lights one day.

33:52.440 --> 33:56.817
- If you can abide the racket.
- The work would go faster if you'd help.

33:56.903 --> 34:01.066
A man of my means
doesn't engage in physical labor.

34:01.157 --> 34:03.529
Which brings us...

34:04.452 --> 34:06.740
to your bill.

34:08.581 --> 34:11.748
- You're running a tab.
- I didn't agree to that.

34:11.835 --> 34:18.039
Mrs. Lord, in any civilized place
my name alone is quite sufficient.

34:18.132 --> 34:22.878
Well, out here in the rough-and-tumble
West, we tend to use cash.

34:22.971 --> 34:26.719
That is a twenty-dollar gold piece
on your watch fob, isn't it?

34:26.808 --> 34:29.891
And the watch itself is gold, of course?

34:29.978 --> 34:33.809
And the cufflinks? Genuine diamonds?

34:34.358 --> 34:38.770
Are you proposing that I barter with you
as I would a street vendor in Calcutta?

34:38.862 --> 34:41.531
Don't be absurd.
You will run a proper tab

34:41.614 --> 34:48.234
until this pathetic town has a proper bank
to which I can wire funds.

35:42.716 --> 35:46.845
Here, now. What is going on?
Why aren't you riding that wheel?

35:47.973 --> 35:51.306
No time. I'm working.

35:51.393 --> 35:54.310
You men will take forever.
Using a boy to do a man's work?

35:55.522 --> 35:57.597
Very narrow down there.

35:57.690 --> 36:01.604
He's the only one
small enough to widen it.

36:02.737 --> 36:08.241
The moment it is wide enough, I expect
to see one of you down there in his place.

36:08.326 --> 36:11.113
And he back on that bicycle.

36:21.339 --> 36:24.957
Mrs. Lord, I should like to apologize.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.507
The truth is,

36:28.596 --> 36:34.182
my coin, watch and cufflinks
are all I own in the world.

36:35.978 --> 36:38.385
I beg your pardon?

36:39.440 --> 36:43.223
My father, in his final demented days,

36:44.361 --> 36:48.773
sold all his holdings and invested
everything, the entire family fortune,

36:48.866 --> 36:51.356
in a certain silver mine.

36:53.662 --> 36:55.072
I see.

36:55.164 --> 36:58.579
I was rude earlier. I apologize.

36:58.667 --> 37:02.082
Once I get the mine running,
I'll pay my bill in full

37:02.170 --> 37:05.254
and be on the first stage out of here.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.399
As Old Fred would say,
that's a real gullywasher.

37:26.487 --> 37:29.986
Don't look at me.
I had nothing to do with it.

37:30.074 --> 37:33.692
I hope Old Fred made it
to the muling station before this hit.

37:33.786 --> 37:37.154
Yesterday a desert, today a monsoon.

37:38.666 --> 37:42.449
Once I reopen the mine,
the whole town will prosper.

37:42.544 --> 37:46.790
You'll be able to afford
whatever your hearts desire.

37:46.882 --> 37:50.048
And what is it that your heart desires,
Mr. Gummer?

37:50.135 --> 37:52.423
To return to the life I had.

37:52.513 --> 37:57.554
To wake up every morning and wonder
"What will I spend my money on today?"

38:00.604 --> 38:06.558
I'd venture it matters not how you spend
your money, but how you spend your life.

38:06.652 --> 38:10.020
- Mr. Gummer?
- Don't interrupt your elders.

38:10.572 --> 38:12.813
Never you mind, Miss Lord.

38:12.908 --> 38:17.735
I'll amend my misspent life
when the Grim Reaper comes calling.

38:37.473 --> 38:41.221
I recommend that
you keep that hog leg skinned,

38:41.311 --> 38:46.731
unless you got a desire to be
jumpin' over hot coals in hell.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.774
And who might you be, sir?

38:52.864 --> 38:55.354
- Kelly.
- "Black Hand" Kelly?

38:58.912 --> 39:01.996
I'm lookin' for Hiram Gummer.

39:04.292 --> 39:06.498
That would be me.

39:06.586 --> 39:10.500
- You posted yourself an advertisement?
- I did. Yes, I did.

39:10.590 --> 39:14.587
So who do you want me to kill?
That Injun over there?

39:14.678 --> 39:15.709
No, no, no, no.

39:15.804 --> 39:20.300
It's not so much a "who" as a "what".

39:22.102 --> 39:27.344
They spring from the ground like, uh...
like some demonic trout.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.440
We call them "dirt dragons".

39:31.486 --> 39:35.779
This stuff sure must be
a whole lot stronger than it tastes.

39:35.865 --> 39:42.116
We're well aware that it sounds fantastic,
but we can assure you it's all quite true.

39:45.458 --> 39:50.582
- They're ferocious and fast.
- It takes real backbone to face 'em down.

39:50.671 --> 39:54.834
Amigo, I like to fight with rattlesnakes
just for the fun of it,

39:54.926 --> 39:58.425
and I give 'em first bite to boot.

39:58.512 --> 40:03.173
Hyperbole aside,
you are accurate with a firearm?

40:03.267 --> 40:07.679
- Questioning my abilities, sir?
- As an astute businessman, I'm simply...

40:07.772 --> 40:09.930
Hey, boy!

40:10.024 --> 40:14.981
- Toss me one of them apples over here.
- See, I knew it. Shoot inside house.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.739
- Throw it high?
- No, no, no.

40:19.825 --> 40:22.991
- You throw it right straight at me.
- OK.

40:23.078 --> 40:26.411
- You ready?
- Anytime.

40:38.177 --> 40:41.130
- What?
- We thought you shoot apple.

40:41.222 --> 40:44.922
Obviously we were expecting
to see a demonstration of...

41:04.578 --> 41:06.487
You're hired.

41:06.580 --> 41:09.948
- In China, no one shoots in wall.
- In China, no one has gun.

41:10.042 --> 41:18.215
Before I sign up for anything, talk to me
about that "salary negotiable" part.

41:19.927 --> 41:23.675
Do you like silver, Mr. Kelly?

41:23.764 --> 41:25.471
I reckon I do.

41:25.557 --> 41:28.760
Upon dispatching all the
aforementioned creatures,

41:28.852 --> 41:32.351
and upon the reopening of the mine,
you'll be paid in silver.

41:32.439 --> 41:36.650
Say, um... as much as you can carry
on a strong horse?

41:36.735 --> 41:43.401
Well, now, I just bet that you could
charm a cow right out of her calf

41:43.492 --> 41:45.899
with those fancy words.

41:45.994 --> 41:51.236
But now, for myself, I sorta need
a little something up front.

41:53.001 --> 41:55.373
We don't have any money.

41:59.007 --> 42:00.964
Ah, well.

42:01.051 --> 42:03.624
Thank you for your time.

42:12.187 --> 42:14.974
Double eagle.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.638
A down payment.

42:23.449 --> 42:28.691
Tell you what. You throw in
them there cufflinks and, uh...

42:28.787 --> 42:31.704
you got yourself a deal.

42:54.604 --> 42:59.515
This is one sorry collection
of lead pushers you got here.

42:59.609 --> 43:02.230
I'm not running a gun store, Mr. Kelly.

43:04.322 --> 43:08.105
Juan, you take this here big old 45-70.

43:08.201 --> 43:13.575
Hiram, pick yourself out
something that feels right in your hand.

43:13.665 --> 43:20.581
And you give us all these
blue whistlers that you got.

43:21.964 --> 43:23.837
Juan.

43:25.009 --> 43:28.923
- Take this.
- Oh, pero no. I still can't afford it.

43:29.013 --> 43:32.512
No credit. It's a gift.

43:34.602 --> 43:37.519
Gracias.

43:37.605 --> 43:39.015
What?

43:39.106 --> 43:42.106
No one goes without a hat in China.

43:42.193 --> 43:44.898
OK, boys, let's jingle some spurs.

43:44.988 --> 43:49.151
No. No. No spurs.
In fact, no jingling of any kind.

44:25.403 --> 44:29.186
I tell you, these things are attracted
by the slightest noise.

44:29.282 --> 44:32.900
They could leap from the ground
at any moment.

44:35.287 --> 44:38.204
Juan killed one right here.

44:59.978 --> 45:02.053
Shh, shh, shh.

45:18.330 --> 45:20.619
Cuídate, señor.

45:20.708 --> 45:23.827
There ain't nothin' here neither.

45:24.962 --> 45:27.535
Maybe they gone deaf.

45:29.133 --> 45:33.000
Or maybe you two boys
are playing me for the fool.

45:33.095 --> 45:35.799
After what I paid you?

45:38.350 --> 45:43.557
- We will just have to keep looking.
- Juan, if you please, some help.

45:46.525 --> 45:50.273
Gummer, dag nab it,
ain't you got no pride?

45:50.362 --> 45:53.066
Get up on the horse by yourself!

45:54.116 --> 45:59.110
Should I ever again require horsemanship,
I will engage a tutor.

46:01.039 --> 46:06.377
Well, I'll tell you one thing. I ain't got
your book-learning, but I know this:

46:06.461 --> 46:09.829
Being full-growed don't make you a man.

46:21.351 --> 46:23.094
Look, look, look, look.

46:24.312 --> 46:26.387
Here, here.

46:34.489 --> 46:38.486
They appear to be... shells. Eggs.

46:39.661 --> 46:42.578
Well, if that's what they are...

46:44.999 --> 46:48.332
then they came out of one big chicken.

46:49.462 --> 46:54.752
Or maybe you two aren't as crazy
as I've been thinking.

46:55.301 --> 47:00.177
This is where we pipe
the hot spring from the mine.

47:00.265 --> 47:05.507
The water cut through the dirt, you see?
And the eggs fell out.

47:05.604 --> 47:08.688
Perhaps the warm water hatched them.

47:08.774 --> 47:12.308
Juan, this tells us how many there are.

47:12.861 --> 47:15.565
There are four. And I killed one already.

47:15.655 --> 47:18.655
- Three left.
- But where could they have gone?

47:18.742 --> 47:22.739
Well, we're just gonna keep on ridin'
till we find them,

47:22.829 --> 47:28.701
cos I'm gettin' awful anxious
to unravel me some cartridges.

47:34.924 --> 47:38.174
We piped that hot water out
only six months ago.

47:38.261 --> 47:42.424
Then those creatures
grew large quite quickly.

47:50.398 --> 47:56.103
That's a part of one of them.
These scaly things were on their backs.

47:59.115 --> 48:02.281
Yeah? Well...

48:02.368 --> 48:06.697
Maybe one of them there "things" died.

48:06.789 --> 48:11.664
Or maybe... maybe he shed his skin,
like a snake.

48:11.752 --> 48:14.539
Who is that?

48:17.967 --> 48:22.095
It's Old Fred. At least, that's his wagon.

48:30.312 --> 48:32.768
Good Lord.

48:32.857 --> 48:35.561
This does not bode well.

48:47.121 --> 48:51.367
Now, that is one
catawampussly chawed-up rig.

48:51.459 --> 48:56.251
As I keep say... saying,
these things are not to be trifled with.

48:57.465 --> 48:59.540
Old Fred?

49:02.553 --> 49:04.628
Old Fred?

49:07.433 --> 49:09.508
Old Fred?

49:47.222 --> 49:49.795
Maybe we should have made it longer.

49:49.891 --> 49:53.010
Well, I'm not totin' no more rocks.

49:55.689 --> 49:59.271
- We should say something.
- I didn't even know the man.

49:59.359 --> 50:01.932
Take off your hat.

50:07.033 --> 50:10.449
Fred was an old man.

50:10.538 --> 50:13.989
That is why we called him Old Fred.

50:15.125 --> 50:17.995
He drove the freight.

50:18.087 --> 50:21.870
He had bad breath.
But I don't want to say that.

50:21.966 --> 50:24.373
All right. All right.

50:27.805 --> 50:30.758
"Fear no more the heat o' the sun,

50:30.849 --> 50:34.134
Nor the furious winter's rages."

50:34.228 --> 50:37.561
"Thou thy worldly task hast done,

50:38.232 --> 50:41.102
Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages."

50:43.403 --> 50:45.691
Cymbeline. Act four, scene two.

50:45.781 --> 50:47.987
We'd best get going.

50:48.075 --> 50:51.574
- Wait. Let's make camp here.
- No, we'll go to the ridge.

50:51.661 --> 50:54.946
Camp on solid rock.
As we have every night.

50:55.040 --> 50:58.989
Oh, no. That is three miles back there.
That's hard country.

50:59.085 --> 51:02.288
If you think I'd risk
sleeping on the naked earth...

51:02.380 --> 51:06.876
We could go down to the muling station.
Down the canyon.

51:06.968 --> 51:08.675
- Is it safe?
- Yes.

51:08.762 --> 51:14.634
There are thick beams on the floor for the
wagons. The dragons can't break through.

51:33.244 --> 51:36.244
- Might there be someone here?
- No.

51:36.330 --> 51:38.702
They stopped the supply wagons
now that...

51:38.791 --> 51:42.456
Now that the mine is closed.
The bitter refrain of my life, it seems.

51:42.545 --> 51:47.089
We must secure these horses with
certainty. The last time, they got away.

51:47.175 --> 51:51.124
You just make sure
that gate is tied up tight.

52:28.633 --> 52:30.292
Mr. Kelly!

52:32.637 --> 52:38.176
You can't see the door
if you're facing this direction.

52:38.267 --> 52:40.971
Always be prepared.

53:43.499 --> 53:45.906
Aaargh! ¡Sálvame, Dios!

53:50.256 --> 53:52.925
What in God's name?

54:03.310 --> 54:05.682
- So was that them?
- No.

54:06.897 --> 54:08.640
No.

54:08.732 --> 54:11.602
Something new.

54:26.625 --> 54:28.950
You said to pick one
I was comfortable with.

54:29.044 --> 54:33.290
You're right. I did say that.

54:36.176 --> 54:39.876
What in Sam Hill is that smell?

54:40.513 --> 54:44.296
It's them. That's the smell.
Remember, señor?

54:44.392 --> 54:48.175
But they've changed so.
Become long and thin.

54:48.271 --> 54:51.271
There's six of them,

54:51.357 --> 54:53.266
or even nine.

54:54.193 --> 54:56.649
We'd better bring the horses inside.

54:58.407 --> 54:59.949
¡Chingada!

55:00.033 --> 55:02.155
They're gone! Again!

55:04.204 --> 55:07.655
We can't go on foot.
They'll get us for sure.

55:07.749 --> 55:10.915
All right. All right.

55:11.003 --> 55:14.952
That means we have to
stand our ground here.

55:15.048 --> 55:20.089
Hiram, it's about time you learned
how to use a real piece.

55:20.178 --> 55:24.389
That's your job.
If I need a gun fired, I hire a gunman.

55:24.474 --> 55:27.593
If you want to bed down
with a real pretty woman,

55:27.686 --> 55:30.603
I s'pose you just
hire somebody to do that too.

55:30.689 --> 55:33.689
Spare me your tiresome analogies.

55:33.775 --> 55:34.973
Hiram.

55:35.068 --> 55:38.982
Now, I said this once,
and I'm gonna say it one more time.

55:39.072 --> 55:45.608
There are some things a man has to do for
himself, and right now shootin' is one.

55:45.703 --> 55:51.408
And give me that stupid hideout piece.
It ain't gonna do you no good now.

55:55.922 --> 56:01.212
OK, Juan, you keep your eye peeled
for them there snake things.

56:01.302 --> 56:06.259
Pay attention, Hiram.
Now, this is a single-action Colt Army.

56:06.349 --> 56:09.682
This is the finest wheel gun ever made.

56:11.479 --> 56:15.097
Don't be holdin' it like it's some skunk.

56:15.191 --> 56:20.861
Now, it's an extension of your hand, OK?
It's part of you.

56:20.946 --> 56:24.231
- And take a stance, like you mean it.
- Mean what?

56:24.325 --> 56:28.702
Like you mean that every last lead plum
that comes out of that barrel

56:28.787 --> 56:31.360
is gonna kill whatever you aim at.

56:31.457 --> 56:36.001
OK. OK. Take yourself a shot
at that can over there by the window.

56:36.087 --> 56:39.420
You line up this blade with this notch

56:39.507 --> 56:44.168
then you just squeeze the trigger.
You don't jerk it.

56:55.606 --> 57:00.563
It's all right. They cannot
break through the floor beams.

57:00.653 --> 57:07.616
Now, you just relax, you just let your eyes,
your brain, your hand, your trigger finger,

57:07.702 --> 57:10.371
all becomes one.

57:18.504 --> 57:21.173
It's all right.
You got consistency now.

57:21.257 --> 57:25.206
- This is a waste of time!
- What do you expect?

57:25.302 --> 57:28.967
You wanna learn in 20 minutes
what took me 20 years?

57:58.835 --> 58:03.164
They cannot break through the floor,
so they are tearing it apart.

58:03.256 --> 58:05.711
How could a snake be so strong?

58:11.640 --> 58:15.969
- Look at that. They decoyed us.
- Good Lord. How smart are they?

58:16.061 --> 58:20.521
Está malo. We're gonna have
nothing left to stand on.

58:22.860 --> 58:26.193
- Telegraph?
- It is no good for us.

58:26.280 --> 58:31.404
- We don't know the clicking code.
- Click anything. Someone will hear us.

58:48.010 --> 58:50.500
I don't know what it is.
It's not Morse.

58:50.595 --> 58:53.382
It's been going on
for more than an hour?

58:53.473 --> 58:57.684
Maybe a tree is touching the wire.
That happened before.

58:57.769 --> 58:59.311
This is different.

58:59.396 --> 59:05.765
The telegrapher at Carson City wouldn't
allow foolishness with his equipment.

59:05.860 --> 59:10.272
- Maybe not Carson City.
- Not Carson City? Where else?

59:19.165 --> 59:22.284
This is from Carson City.

59:29.300 --> 59:32.336
Where's that one from?

59:34.180 --> 59:39.554
This is from the muling station. It must be
Mr. Gummer. He's the only one out there.

59:39.644 --> 59:43.095
- When will Tecopa and Pyong be back?
- One, two days.

59:43.189 --> 59:45.645
Gone upcountry. Getting firewood.

59:45.734 --> 59:48.853
All right then. I'll go myself.

59:52.908 --> 59:55.743
Must you tap so loudly?

01:00:09.215 --> 01:00:11.207
Let your lead fly, man!

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:51.248
What the hell are we up against?

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:53.913
They... they grew.

01:00:55.010 --> 01:01:01.048
Those snakes are not snakes.
They are tongues. Three tongues!

01:01:01.141 --> 01:01:05.849
- Each creature has three tongues.
- And we saw nine before.

01:01:06.563 --> 01:01:12.683
- So there's still only three animals.
- That's supposed to make me feel better?

01:01:12.778 --> 01:01:16.727
Good God, man, those things are
the size of eight-mule freight wagons!

01:01:16.823 --> 01:01:22.328
- Well, shoot them, like you're hired to do!
- You got to know your enemy, Hiram!

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:28.241
I oughta be totin' some eight-bore
firin' solid shot.

01:01:28.336 --> 01:01:32.713
Or some damn punt gun.
Not these weapons I got.

01:01:38.137 --> 01:01:41.054
All right. All right.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.508
I tell ya what we're gonna do.
We're gonna... we're gonna...

01:01:44.602 --> 01:01:47.389
We're gonna hold our fire
till they come after us.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:53.150
And then... and then we're gonna go
toe to toe, point blank, full bore,

01:01:53.235 --> 01:01:55.607
throw all the lead we got at 'em.

01:01:55.696 --> 01:02:00.274
And then maybe we'll get a... a lucky hit.

01:02:00.367 --> 01:02:02.774
A brain shot or something.

01:02:24.182 --> 01:02:29.721
- There is not much floor left.
- They'll be makin' their move anytime.

01:02:35.777 --> 01:02:38.065
Get ready.

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:41.071
This may be it.

01:02:58.717 --> 01:03:02.251
Now what are they up to?

01:03:08.977 --> 01:03:11.349
Oh, no!

01:03:11.438 --> 01:03:13.062
Mr. Kelly!

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:19.148
Eat this!

01:03:59.944 --> 01:04:01.319
I'm out! I'm out!

01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:05.109
Christine is coming, Señor Gummer!

01:04:05.199 --> 01:04:06.858
Christine! Over here!

01:04:20.715 --> 01:04:22.754
Just drive the wagon!

01:04:22.842 --> 01:04:27.302
- Where's Mr. Kelly?
- Dead. Go on! Go on! Go!

01:04:32.142 --> 01:04:35.511
Well done, Mrs. Lord!
Are they following us?

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:37.229
I can't tell.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.569
Yes, they are following us.

01:04:46.741 --> 01:04:47.855
Faster!

01:04:49.869 --> 01:04:53.119
- They're at their limit. Hyah! Come on!
- We shall see.

01:05:21.859 --> 01:05:24.396
They're enormous. Ravenous.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:30.276
"Spirit demons from dark places,
eating souls that live in the light."

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:34.735
Part of our legend.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:38.495
We put bullet after bullet into them.
It didn't even slow them down.

01:05:39.918 --> 01:05:42.871
Will they come here? To our town?

01:05:42.963 --> 01:05:47.007
They'd have to get through the pass.
Lots of rocks. Maybe they cannot do it.

01:05:47.092 --> 01:05:51.421
It hardly matters.
The mine will remain unapproachable.

01:05:53.098 --> 01:05:55.767
So what is your intention?

01:05:55.851 --> 01:06:00.512
My intention is to leave this godforsaken
place, as should all of you.

01:06:00.605 --> 01:06:02.229
But the mine...

01:06:02.315 --> 01:06:06.775
Are you listening?
The mine is lost. Forget the mine.

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:12.901
Go on with your lives as if it never existed.
Start your lives over, just as I will have to.

01:06:12.994 --> 01:06:16.327
No stupid animal
is going to make me leave my land.

01:06:16.414 --> 01:06:19.498
I'll go to Carson City,
get some blasting powder.

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:22.156
Juan, we were lucky. Dumb lucky.

01:06:22.253 --> 01:06:27.958
If a man like Black Hand Kelly is no match
for them, what chance do we have?

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:33.257
Pyong, why would you stay? Take
Fu Yien and the missis back to China.

01:06:34.264 --> 01:06:36.552
Lu Wan forgets.

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:42.227
China not perfect. No place perfect.

01:06:44.024 --> 01:06:47.060
We will not leave our new home.

01:07:00.165 --> 01:07:06.748
I'll send for my belongings, and see that
the horse and equipment are returned.

01:07:06.838 --> 01:07:09.838
That won't be necessary.
You can keep the horse,

01:07:09.924 --> 01:07:13.838
and the saddle and the rifle
and the knife.

01:07:13.928 --> 01:07:17.047
In trade for ownership of the mine.

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:21.268
- You can't be serious.
- It's the best offer you're gonna get.

01:07:22.395 --> 01:07:26.724
When I reach Philadelphia, I intend
to sell that mine for at least $50,000.

01:07:26.816 --> 01:07:29.603
You will be preceded by a telegram
to the newspapers

01:07:29.694 --> 01:07:35.862
describing in detail the creatures plaguing
the mine, and why it is unworkable.

01:07:36.826 --> 01:07:39.577
That's blackmail.
You wouldn't betray me like that.

01:07:39.662 --> 01:07:42.034
We voted.

01:07:42.123 --> 01:07:44.495
Four to one in favor
of doing exactly that.

01:07:44.584 --> 01:07:47.918
At least one of you
has some sense of ethics.

01:07:48.005 --> 01:07:50.840
I voted to drop you off a cliff.

01:07:51.299 --> 01:07:54.798
Stay with us, Hiram. Stay and fight.

01:07:56.346 --> 01:07:59.097
You're wasting your lives.

01:08:05.063 --> 01:08:07.980
You can have the cursed mine.

01:08:17.492 --> 01:08:18.867
Whoa. Whoa.

01:08:19.786 --> 01:08:23.451
Mr. Gummer, please don't leave us.

01:08:28.336 --> 01:08:30.457
Fu...

01:08:30.546 --> 01:08:33.215
Fu Yien, I can't help you.

01:10:22.157 --> 01:10:25.360
¡Madre de Dios. Hyah! Hyah!

01:10:54.814 --> 01:10:57.140
We were wrong. They're coming.

01:10:58.986 --> 01:11:02.817
The dirt dragons, they got through
the upper valley pass.

01:11:02.906 --> 01:11:05.942
I don't know when,
but they are definitely coming.

01:11:06.035 --> 01:11:08.323
Maybe they not find us, keep going south.

01:11:08.412 --> 01:11:10.902
No, no, no, no. They hunt by sound.

01:11:10.998 --> 01:11:14.829
We are the only thing making noise
between here and Carson City.

01:11:14.918 --> 01:11:17.455
What do the sticks say?

01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:22.666
"Expect a ferocious arrival."

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.588
Well, this is it, then.

01:11:30.392 --> 01:11:33.096
The end of Rejection.

01:11:50.453 --> 01:11:56.657
One ticket for your next train
to Philadelphia. Sleeping car.

01:11:56.751 --> 01:11:59.787
- One way.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:07.595 --> 01:12:09.338
Fools.

01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:13.012
- I beg your pardon?
- The people up in Rejection.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.892
Funnier than a dancing bear, eh?
Here's one they sent yesterday.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.230
"Giant worms have left upper valley."

01:12:21.317 --> 01:12:23.724
- "May find town."
- May I?

01:12:23.819 --> 01:12:28.776
"Need immediate help."
"Giant worms."

01:12:31.577 --> 01:12:33.736
One ticket.

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:35.454
Sir? Your ticket?

01:13:18.249 --> 01:13:24.002
I was thinkin' I could make a sled for it.
We could pull it behind the last wagon.

01:13:24.088 --> 01:13:26.163
There's no room.

01:13:27.007 --> 01:13:29.580
Time to let it go.

01:13:40.938 --> 01:13:42.811
Juan, where will you go?

01:13:42.898 --> 01:13:49.481
There is a new strike down near Tonopah.
I'm thinking of heading that way.

01:13:49.571 --> 01:13:52.275
Where will we go?

01:13:52.366 --> 01:13:57.111
- We are going to San Francisco.
- And then back to China.

01:13:58.163 --> 01:14:02.207
All our money is put in the store,
and now it's all gone.

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:07.748
And you are not going to work on
the railroad like momma and poppa.

01:14:10.593 --> 01:14:13.000
They're coming!

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:22.513
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

01:14:22.605 --> 01:14:26.685
They will come from the north,
not from the south.

01:14:26.775 --> 01:14:30.393
That is something else... or someone.

01:14:50.048 --> 01:14:52.752
What poor soul
would be coming here now?

01:15:01.268 --> 01:15:02.678
It's Mr. Gummer!

01:15:06.857 --> 01:15:08.896
Come on! Whoa!

01:15:12.821 --> 01:15:14.564
"A ferocious arrival"?

01:15:24.249 --> 01:15:29.705
Well, now, maybe I'll
let you keep him after all.

01:15:29.796 --> 01:15:35.382
Stop! Whoa, curse you! Whoa! Whoa!

01:15:35.968 --> 01:15:38.672
Whoa, you intransigent beasts!

01:15:38.763 --> 01:15:42.594
- Delighted to see you're all well.
- Hiram, they could be here any minute!

01:15:42.683 --> 01:15:44.722
- I know.
- Whatever are you thinking?

01:15:44.811 --> 01:15:50.647
That this idyllic Western retreat shall not
fall prey to these mindless predators.

01:15:50.734 --> 01:15:57.566
I have a cache of weapons that would
impress even the late Black Hand Kelly.

01:15:57.657 --> 01:16:01.737
One Sharps.52-calibre buffalo rifle.

01:16:02.662 --> 01:16:07.869
One Remington 45-120 Rolling Block.

01:16:09.169 --> 01:16:14.922
One Henry repeating rifle. Smaller caliber,
but impressive rate of fire.

01:16:15.925 --> 01:16:18.925
One eight-gauge Remington... um...

01:16:20.054 --> 01:16:21.252
derringer.

01:16:21.347 --> 01:16:27.136
One LC Smith ten-gauge
stub twist coach gun.

01:16:27.228 --> 01:16:30.063
And this.

01:16:30.148 --> 01:16:33.896
A two-inch-bore punt gun.

01:16:37.113 --> 01:16:41.490
Hiram, how did you get all of these
things? You don't have any money.

01:16:47.373 --> 01:16:51.501
A wise friend once told me it's not
important how you spend your money,

01:16:51.585 --> 01:16:54.585
but how you spend your life.

01:16:55.423 --> 01:17:00.001
Hiram Gummer, what is it
you think we are going to do? Hm?

01:17:00.094 --> 01:17:06.760
Madam, I intend we throw our visitors
a little corpse-and-cartridge occasion.

01:17:08.018 --> 01:17:13.225
That we stand our ground and
fight these despicable beasts to the death!

01:17:19.696 --> 01:17:22.401
We will fight!

01:17:22.492 --> 01:17:24.034
Right.

01:17:26.788 --> 01:17:33.668
It takes me two years to make you
leave China. You think I want to go back?

01:17:33.753 --> 01:17:35.911
- We do it.
- We'll stomp 'em like snakes.

01:17:36.005 --> 01:17:38.495
- We will burn them down.
- We'll smoke 'em up!

01:17:39.509 --> 01:17:44.170
Ah, Juan. Knowing you,
you'll need a spare.

01:17:46.224 --> 01:17:48.549
Gracias, amigo.

01:17:54.148 --> 01:17:57.766
They'll probably be coming
from the north or the northeast.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:00.066
Then we go out there and shoot them.

01:18:00.154 --> 01:18:03.238
Too dangerous.
They can come up anywhere.

01:18:03.324 --> 01:18:05.399
We dare not face them on their terms.

01:18:05.492 --> 01:18:09.157
- Stake a horse. When they go for it...
- Tecopa, that's cruel.

01:18:09.246 --> 01:18:12.496
Well, these are cruel times.

01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:16.034
Can't we make noise
with something else?

01:18:16.128 --> 01:18:20.540
That is a good idea, Fuito.
Any noise works.

01:18:20.632 --> 01:18:25.009
It doesn't have to be a horse. We could
make noise on something like this.

01:18:25.095 --> 01:18:27.764
Then when they come up, we shoot them.

01:18:27.848 --> 01:18:31.715
Yes, an ambush. We will
lead them into our very gun muzzles.

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:36.021
We will make Rejection our last bastion,
our last line of defense.

01:18:36.106 --> 01:18:40.352
- Our Alamo.
- Juan, we were the losers at the Alamo.

01:18:40.443 --> 01:18:43.360
Speak for yourself, gringo.

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:55.115
More cans. I need more cans.

01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:58.660
I'm eating as fast as I can.

01:18:59.922 --> 01:19:02.543
What is all this?

01:19:02.633 --> 01:19:07.010
When they come, how do we know
they come? We cannot see them.

01:19:07.096 --> 01:19:11.639
- Well, that is a concern.
- When the ground shakes...

01:19:11.725 --> 01:19:14.429
we know they are here.

01:19:15.479 --> 01:19:16.510
Dandy.

01:19:24.905 --> 01:19:26.897
What is a punt gun?

01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:31.236
Something to do with shooting ducks.
A great many ducks.

01:19:31.328 --> 01:19:35.111
"Pour in one pound of shot or balls.
Ram it down tight..."

01:19:35.207 --> 01:19:37.282
Yup! Hyah!

01:19:47.802 --> 01:19:52.214
Won't we need the horses?
I mean, if we lose the fight?

01:19:52.307 --> 01:19:56.684
Can't have them making
unnecessary noise. Might spoil our trap.

01:19:56.769 --> 01:19:59.390
And we're not going to lose, Fuito.

01:20:41.773 --> 01:20:44.346
Shall we begin?

01:22:08.942 --> 01:22:11.315
Maybe we should try again tomorrow.

01:22:11.404 --> 01:22:16.528
Perhaps Pyong was right. Perhaps
they've bypassed us for Carson City.

01:22:16.617 --> 01:22:18.408
I don't know.

01:22:18.494 --> 01:22:22.740
The ridge at the south end of the valley
is all rock, like a big wall.

01:22:22.832 --> 01:22:27.375
- I don't think they can get past it.
- They gotta be somewhere.

01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:42.510
No! Fu, get inside!

01:22:42.601 --> 01:22:46.468
- But I want to fight too!
- Fu, Fu.

01:22:46.563 --> 01:22:52.268
The store is our fort.
We can't ever leave the fort unguarded.

01:22:52.361 --> 01:22:56.144
You stay inside and keep guard.

01:23:19.929 --> 01:23:22.336
You missed! With a cannon!

01:23:31.357 --> 01:23:35.224
- Where did it go?
- Maybe the noise scared him away.

01:23:44.328 --> 01:23:47.329
Mr. Gummer, it's coming!
It's coming back!

01:23:48.750 --> 01:23:50.409
Hiram, quick!

01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:24.986
Yeah!

01:24:38.424 --> 01:24:40.463
It worked!

01:24:40.551 --> 01:24:41.630
Ugh!

01:24:41.719 --> 01:24:43.094
It stinks!

01:24:46.098 --> 01:24:49.051
- There!
- Two more to go! Take your positions!

01:24:49.143 --> 01:24:51.052
Fu Yien, back inside!

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:10.196
Juan!

01:25:18.339 --> 01:25:21.590
Did it do that on purpose?

01:25:21.676 --> 01:25:23.419
Juan, look out!

01:25:52.999 --> 01:25:55.205
Cannot shoot through dirt.

01:26:16.438 --> 01:26:19.438
Hyah! Hah!

01:26:20.692 --> 01:26:24.274
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:26:48.678 --> 01:26:50.753
¡Ay, caramba!

01:26:50.847 --> 01:26:53.468
Tecopa, gracias.

01:26:54.768 --> 01:26:56.226
Aston...

01:26:56.311 --> 01:27:01.057
Astonishingly clever,
my man.

01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:05.527
- It take your gun. Did it know?
- I fear they are very intelligent.

01:27:05.613 --> 01:27:08.282
- But not as smart as us.
- No.

01:27:08.365 --> 01:27:11.615
Not as smart as us.
And there's only one left.

01:27:11.702 --> 01:27:15.782
Where the hell is it?
Let it show itself!

01:27:27.634 --> 01:27:29.709
Tecopa...

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.220
- Is it leaving?
- No.

01:28:15.306 --> 01:28:20.263
No, it's circling. Listening for prey.

01:28:24.941 --> 01:28:27.182
What do we do?

01:28:27.276 --> 01:28:30.193
It seems our rifles
aren't strong enough to kill it.

01:28:30.279 --> 01:28:33.398
Without the punt gun, I fear we're lost.

01:28:33.491 --> 01:28:37.703
So we just stop the fight, then? Give up?

01:28:37.788 --> 01:28:40.278
Maybe we take traction engine.
Try to get away.

01:28:40.373 --> 01:28:43.824
- It moves so slowly.
- And you would leave our town?

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:47.750
You have ideas for killing it?

01:28:47.839 --> 01:28:50.923
A man must learn to sail in all winds.

01:28:51.468 --> 01:28:55.002
We must do what we can
with what we have.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.435
Well said.

01:29:01.519 --> 01:29:06.643
You have black powder.
Maybe we could blow it up somehow.

01:29:06.733 --> 01:29:10.730
Sure. We make big firecracker.
I know how.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:15.647
Excellent - but quietly.
Move very, very slowly.

01:29:16.409 --> 01:29:19.777
Fu Yien, you go inside
and get twine for fuse.

01:29:19.871 --> 01:29:21.744
OK.

01:29:34.468 --> 01:29:39.758
- What are you doing?
- Powder for the fuse must be very fine.

01:29:47.481 --> 01:29:50.054
Almost there. Just another few minutes.

01:29:54.905 --> 01:29:56.731
Fu...

01:30:12.131 --> 01:30:13.541
Fu!

01:30:17.637 --> 01:30:21.052
- I can't see the door.
- Fu, stay very quiet.

01:30:26.604 --> 01:30:28.762
Make noise!

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:32.141
Out here! Hey!

01:30:44.204 --> 01:30:47.407
Why doesn't it come for us?
For the noise?

01:30:47.499 --> 01:30:50.618
I don't know.
They keep learning our every trick.

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:53.284
He's over here.

01:30:55.549 --> 01:30:56.793
Fu!

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.342
Good boy. Good boy.

01:31:04.683 --> 01:31:07.304
Hurry up. The wagon! In the wagon!

01:31:07.394 --> 01:31:09.801
Get on.

01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:16.599
- Oh, good Lord!
- Let's get the rifles.

01:31:19.364 --> 01:31:21.439
The bomb!

01:31:36.339 --> 01:31:39.458
- Pyong, you must finish the bomb.
- I need more time!

01:31:46.016 --> 01:31:48.471
We'll never have time to finish that!

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.261
I have an idea.

01:32:05.952 --> 01:32:07.944
¡Hijo de puta!

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:14.365
Pyong, that big belt.

01:32:16.588 --> 01:32:20.537
Excellent, excellent.
Tecopa! Help us here!

01:32:22.385 --> 01:32:26.216
- What we need is some kind of hook.
- I know where.

01:32:26.306 --> 01:32:28.097
Over here, Juan!

01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:54.117
Go.

01:33:04.218 --> 01:33:05.380
Go!

01:33:26.783 --> 01:33:28.277
Watch out!

01:33:34.207 --> 01:33:35.701
Yes!

01:34:03.277 --> 01:34:06.527
- Mrs. Lord, are you well?
- Yes. Are you all right?

01:34:06.614 --> 01:34:08.191
Yes, I am.

01:34:18.959 --> 01:34:21.876
Gracias, amiguito.

01:34:23.672 --> 01:34:26.672
- You got 'em, Mr. Gummer.
- Yes, Hiram. You got 'em.

01:34:26.759 --> 01:34:28.965
No, no.

01:34:29.052 --> 01:34:30.510
We got 'em.

01:34:32.306 --> 01:34:34.464
Well done, well done.

01:34:49.364 --> 01:34:50.644
Hiram!

01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:55.900
The bank has approved your loan. You
can hire new workers, reopen the mine.

01:34:55.996 --> 01:34:59.828
Well, if I recall,
it no longer belongs to me.

01:35:02.253 --> 01:35:05.419
It's yours, Hiram. It's your mine.

01:35:05.506 --> 01:35:07.794
We couldn't cheat you that way.

01:35:07.883 --> 01:35:10.420
You need it worse than we do.

01:35:10.511 --> 01:35:14.211
That's very kind. But I'll only
assume ownership under two conditions.

01:35:15.766 --> 01:35:17.557
"Conditions"?

01:35:17.643 --> 01:35:22.518
We agree never to tell anyone
about the dirt dragons.

01:35:22.606 --> 01:35:26.520
If word of them ever got out,
no one would ever settle here.

01:35:26.610 --> 01:35:29.646
And the second condition?

01:35:29.738 --> 01:35:32.193
That the first proceeds of the mine
are used

01:35:32.282 --> 01:35:37.027
to build a hotel
and a market with real walls,

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.120
to pay off Juan's land, and, uh...

01:35:40.832 --> 01:35:43.405
Tecopa, what do you want?

01:35:47.255 --> 01:35:49.247
A new statue.

01:35:49.341 --> 01:35:51.463
One that looks like me.

01:35:51.551 --> 01:35:54.884
And to commission a statue for Tecopa.

01:35:54.971 --> 01:35:57.426
Does everyone agree to this?

01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:33.628
I am fearfully outclassed.

01:36:33.718 --> 01:36:36.007
It's good you've decided to stay.

01:36:36.096 --> 01:36:40.473
I shall personally supervise the mine - I
mean, as soon as I learn how it all works.

01:36:40.559 --> 01:36:43.725
And I've selected
an excellent location for my home.

01:36:43.812 --> 01:36:48.189
On high ground. Readily defended.
It will even have a basement.

01:36:48.275 --> 01:36:50.350
That's a lot of room for one person.

01:36:50.443 --> 01:36:54.571
Ideally, it... won't be for just one.

01:37:01.413 --> 01:37:06.787
- Oh, I really am hopeless.
- You'll get better with a little practice.

01:37:06.876 --> 01:37:12.415
In the meantime I bought something that
might aid in your success as a marksman.

01:37:16.511 --> 01:37:18.586
Dandy.

01:37:22.100 --> 01:37:24.175
Hiram?
