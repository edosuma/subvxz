WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:08.509
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh. *

00:20.054 --> 00:21.622
Virginia!

00:21.689 --> 00:24.358
Your cousin Delilah sent you
a cardboard chicken!

00:28.529 --> 00:29.997
Damn.

00:30.064 --> 00:32.300
Chickens with DVDs
inside of 'em.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.035
Technology's moving
too fast for me.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.010
(sighs)

00:43.077 --> 00:45.813
(orchestra plays grand theme)

00:45.879 --> 00:47.781
Well, here we go.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.683
America's ugliest home videos.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.121
Hear ye, hear ye!

00:53.187 --> 00:55.156
There's gonna be a grand ball,

00:55.223 --> 00:56.624
because this princess

00:56.690 --> 00:59.160
has finally found
her Prince Charming.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.694
(cash register bell dings)

01:03.030 --> 01:07.034
No we are sparing no expenses
since my Air Force officer

01:07.101 --> 01:09.803
just got a big fat bonus for...

01:09.870 --> 01:12.540
well, I can't tell you why,

01:12.606 --> 01:15.576
but let's just say the Israelis
are gonna get blamed for it.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.045
Now, I know
not all of you have the money

01:18.112 --> 01:19.947
to fly to Las Vegas.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.782
Especially my cousin Virginia.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.651
Although I don't know
why people just can't fly

01:23.717 --> 01:26.287
Southwest since
their fares are so low.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.123
Virginia, maybe you could sneak
into someone's suitcase

01:29.190 --> 01:31.559
since on Southwest,
bags fly for free.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.895
(gasping, magical dinging)

01:34.962 --> 01:36.430
(Delilah and Hope laugh)

01:36.497 --> 01:38.466
Birds!

01:40.067 --> 01:41.669
We're not going to Vegas.

01:41.735 --> 01:42.636
Delilah only invited us

01:42.703 --> 01:44.205
to her wedding
for the same reason

01:44.272 --> 01:46.006
she used to invite me
to all her parties.

01:46.073 --> 01:47.375
Just to humiliate me.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.943
Oh, I just love it!

01:50.010 --> 01:53.147
I want to thank you all
so much for the amazing gifts.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.848
I love these new clothes.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.984
And my cousin Ginny
should thank you, too,

01:57.050 --> 01:59.720
'cause she gets all my old ones,
'cause she's poor.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.725
Now, who's ready to dance?!

02:04.792 --> 02:06.660
* *

02:08.562 --> 02:10.598
(thudding, women gasping)

02:15.403 --> 02:17.471
But you were kids then.
You can handle her now.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.273
I don't care.
We're not going to that wedding.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.476
I hate her, plus,
you're addicted to gambling.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.412
Really? Are you...
addicted to gambling?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.280
No, but apparently
Virginia's addicted

02:26.347 --> 02:28.749
to making me look bad
in front of company.

02:28.816 --> 02:29.750
We're not going.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.151
Oh, come on!

02:31.219 --> 02:32.720
There's other things
to do in Vegas.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.788
You said you always
wanted to see Paris.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.457
They got one there.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.891
Wyatt went to Vegas once.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.694
When he got back, he wouldn't
tell me anything about his trip.

02:40.761 --> 02:41.729
He just kept saying,

02:41.795 --> 02:43.497
"What happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas."

02:43.564 --> 02:46.200
Cool. What happens
in Vegas stays in Vegas,

02:46.267 --> 02:47.568
because wild things happen there

02:47.635 --> 02:49.703
that you wouldn't want people
to know about.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.004
That's clever.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.440
You know what?

02:52.506 --> 02:55.042
I would love to do something in
Vegas that has to stay in Vegas.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.477
Then I could say it to him.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.546
You could
come with me.
You gonna go?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.948
I didn't really think
you were the Vegas type.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.284
That's because you only
really know Daddy Jimmy.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.552
You don't know
"sex in the back

03:04.618 --> 03:06.220
of my van
with a serial killer Jimmy."

03:06.287 --> 03:08.155
I used to be a
wild man before

03:08.222 --> 03:09.590
this little ball-and-chain came

03:09.657 --> 03:11.859
and threw a wet blanket
on my party fire.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.361
Oh.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.129
She is cute, though, isn't she?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.931
Oh, Daddy can't
do nothing anymore

03:17.998 --> 03:20.734
now you came along,
you little cutie patootie.

03:20.801 --> 03:21.969
(talking baby talk)

03:22.035 --> 03:23.904
You need to party.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.939
Oh, I do.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.309
(laughing)

03:28.376 --> 03:32.112
(grunting)

03:32.179 --> 03:34.448
I'm starting to think I should
go to Vegas for the wedding.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.083
I mean, the magic eight ball
says, "Ask me later,"

03:36.149 --> 03:37.551
but I don't have time for that.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.353
Oh, yeah, you can't be
on the eight ball schedule.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.588
You got to live your life.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.256
If I don't go, Delilah wins.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.857
She'll always have
the satisfaction

03:43.924 --> 03:46.594
of knowing that she shamed me
into staying away, right?

03:46.660 --> 03:49.863
Right. Yes. Yes! We are going...

03:49.930 --> 03:51.699
Or maybe not. Maybe
I'm overthinking it.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.534
I think I am.
I think I'm overthinking it.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.868
No. I'm not going.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.437
Never mind.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.944
(gasps)

04:04.011 --> 04:06.647
Wow. What a dream.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.750
I dreamt the donkey
from Shrek said

04:09.817 --> 04:11.485
I shouldn't go
to the wedding.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.387
But then, naked
Obama said

04:13.454 --> 04:15.589
I have to go,
or else Delilah wins.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.491
So, we're going?

04:17.558 --> 04:20.027
Not you.
Obama says I should go to Vegas.

04:20.093 --> 04:23.063
He says you should stay home
'cause of your gambling problem.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.197
(sighs)

04:24.264 --> 04:25.466
Aw, you told him, too?

04:25.533 --> 04:26.934
Well, I had to make small talk.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.302
He was naked.

04:28.369 --> 04:30.003
(sniffles)
It was awkward.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.142
Well, it took three hours,

04:35.208 --> 04:37.645
but the Ouija board just more or
less spelled out the following.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.113
"Delilah is going
to be flaunting

04:40.180 --> 04:42.616
"her new husband in front of me
without you there.

04:42.683 --> 04:44.685
"She'll probably think
our marriage is in trouble,

04:44.752 --> 04:46.687
"since I can't tell her
you stayed home

04:46.754 --> 04:48.088
because of a gambling problem."

04:48.155 --> 04:49.990
I mean, I had
to fill in the blanks,

04:50.057 --> 04:51.291
but that's the gist of it.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.726
Anyway, you have
to come with me.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.362
But you're not allowed
to carry any cash.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.830
Ouija says I hold the money.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.770
We are going to Vegas.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.713
Sorry. Dropping off
Maw Maw and Hope

05:12.780 --> 05:14.415
at Shelley's took
longer than I thought.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.016
Shelley was in the
middle of shooting

05:16.083 --> 05:18.686
this internet video tutorial on
how to change a colostomy bag.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.854
Really makes you appreciate
having an anus.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.423
(doorbell rings)

05:26.093 --> 05:29.029
(with Russian accent):
I am ready for fun
of Vegas clubs

05:29.096 --> 05:30.297
and dancing with high rollers.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.400
(sighs)

05:32.466 --> 05:35.669
I have special alter ego named
Natasha for Las Vegas wild time.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.105
Okay. I...

05:38.171 --> 05:39.707
I was just gonna be Jimmy.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.576
You will be Jimmy, who has
mail-order bride from Russia,

05:42.643 --> 05:44.612
who is also possibly spy.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.448
Hey, guys,
notice anything different?

05:50.083 --> 05:52.219
Do you,
uh... uh...?

05:52.285 --> 05:53.387
Mm, nope.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.988
New hair clip?

05:55.055 --> 05:58.559
Good. I did a little spray tan,
but I tried to keep it subtle.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.773
Look at it.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.675
It's beautiful and sparkling.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.777
Like what I always imagined

06:16.844 --> 06:19.713
Cher's living room
would look like.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.597
Check out the cool moves

06:36.664 --> 06:39.132
on those handsome
capitalist bartenders.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.569
Wait a second.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.970
Something's different about you.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.171
What happened to your tan?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.540
Oh, that stupid cheap
tan spray washed off.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.909
I had to leave a
note for the maid

06:48.976 --> 06:51.044
explaining why the bottom
of the shower was brown.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.379
Whoa, people tip big here.

06:52.446 --> 06:53.981
Guy just gave
that waitress ten bucks.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.048
Ooh.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.484
Don't order drinks
from the waitresses.

06:56.550 --> 06:57.718
We don't have to.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.620
We have all those
free bottles of booze

06:59.687 --> 07:01.254
in that little
refrigerator in our room.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.556
DELILAH:
Virginia!

07:02.623 --> 07:05.158
Burt! I'm looking
down on you.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.828
So is probably everyone else
around you.

07:07.895 --> 07:08.829
(laughs)

07:08.896 --> 07:10.598
Hey, I'll be right down.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.766
(Delilah whooping)

07:15.435 --> 07:19.807
O.M. Ginny, you're here!

07:19.873 --> 07:21.809
No way!

07:21.875 --> 07:23.777
This is just
a wonderful surprise.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.480
How the heck did you
pay for plane tickets?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.516
Took the bus.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.319
A flying bus,
which is what we call planes.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.987
It's a regional term.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.423
Well, whatever lie you want
to go with is fine with me.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.925
I am just so glad you're here.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.428
Are you kidding? After all these
years of waiting and waiting

07:41.495 --> 07:43.196
for someone to ask you.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.032
Nothing could keep me
from your wedding,

07:45.098 --> 07:47.701
unless I died of old age
before it happened.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.869
Well, by looking
at your crow's-feet,

07:48.936 --> 07:50.237
we were cutting it pretty close.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.041
(laughs)
Tomorrow is gonna
be so incredible.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.544
Just like we used
to dream about as kids.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.847
And I'm gonna get married
in Vegas at the Rio.

07:59.913 --> 08:02.683
I'm gonna have a beautiful
wedding dress.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.218
Spandex, but classy.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.588
Well, mine's gonna be
that hyper-colored material

08:07.655 --> 08:09.289
that changes color
when you touch it,

08:09.356 --> 08:12.593
so you can see my husband's
hot handprints on my butt.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.163
Well, my wedding dress
is going to be bedazzled

08:16.229 --> 08:19.166
from head-to-toe
with an eight-foot train.

08:19.232 --> 08:22.202
Well, mine's gonna be beaded
with real antique Spanish coins

08:22.269 --> 08:24.104
and have an 80-foot train,

08:24.171 --> 08:27.775
and the back of it is gonna be
held aloft by Michael Jackson.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.777
(sighs)

08:29.843 --> 08:31.812
Now, did you
guys ever take

08:31.879 --> 08:33.280
the time out
to have an actual wedding,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.816
or were you too focused on your
career as a toilet scrubber?

08:35.883 --> 08:38.151
Oh, no, we had a wedding.
It was quite a fancy affair.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.857
You may kiss the bride.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.967
(gasps)
Is this the line
for clean needle exchange?

08:54.034 --> 08:58.606
Yes, we had
a very classy wedding.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.173
Delilah, get over here!

09:00.240 --> 09:01.274
The bartender says

09:01.341 --> 09:03.543
you can't do a shot
out of his belly button.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.378
Apparently, he's an outie.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.647
I can make it work.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.916
I got a trick I
can do with those.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.884
Why did you lie
about our wedding?

09:10.951 --> 09:12.419
Did you not like our wedding?

09:12.485 --> 09:14.054
You never said anything
at the time.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.789
Well, what good
would it have done?

09:15.856 --> 09:17.324
We didn't have
any money.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.661
Hey, cuz, we're on our way out
to my bachelorette night.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.895
Why don't you come with us?

09:21.962 --> 09:24.231
That sounds great.
Be right there.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.466
Oh, you're just blowing
me off tonight?

09:26.533 --> 09:28.001
Is this 'cause you're
mad about our wedding?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.670
Baby, I got to go.
Otherwise, she'll be

09:29.737 --> 09:31.071
talking trash
about me the whole time

09:31.138 --> 09:33.173
without me there
to defend myself.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.142
I bet she's doing it already
right now.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.344
Hey, I'm not a slut!

09:37.410 --> 09:38.679
I'm not poor!

09:38.746 --> 09:41.048
And my feet are normal-sized!

09:41.114 --> 09:42.750
(hoots)

09:42.816 --> 09:44.685
I'm sorry, baby.
I got to go.

09:47.721 --> 09:50.423
Hey, uh, you're coming
to a bachelorette party.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.424
JIMMY:
No.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.559
She's not going with you.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.661
We're gonna have a wild night

09:53.727 --> 09:55.095
in Vegas to get back at Wyatt.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.363
No, I need backup.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.632
Besides, what's more wild
than a bachelorette party?

09:58.699 --> 09:59.967
I'm gonna go with her.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.709
Mom's not being very nice today.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.377
Yeah, her cousin
brings it out in her.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.946
I think I know how to
make her feel better.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.082
We're gonna give your
mom the kind of beautiful,

10:15.148 --> 10:16.950
fancy-pants wedding
she's always dreamed of.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.019
How are we gonna
do that?
We're gonna
make some money.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.121
How? I mean, you promised Mom
you weren't gonna gamble.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.357
There's other ways
of making money in Vegas.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.275
Okay.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.277
Did someone order a...

10:45.412 --> 10:47.380
...gin and tonic?

10:47.447 --> 10:49.282
All right.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.756
One dollar down,
$2,499 to go.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.424
Okay, who ordered the, uh...

11:00.393 --> 11:02.629
...almondy-tasting
fizzy watery thing?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.364
Looks like there's
milk in it?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.867
Anybody?

11:10.370 --> 11:13.273
(musical beeping)

11:15.642 --> 11:17.177
Clean your slot screen, ma'am?

11:17.244 --> 11:18.378
Can't win

11:18.445 --> 11:20.213
if you can't see.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.149
We work on tips.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.721
What happened
to the garnish tray?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.857
Cigars? Cigarettes?

11:31.258 --> 11:32.860
Cherries? Olives?

11:32.926 --> 11:34.694
Lemon twists?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.629
Are there any gentlemen
who care to purchase

11:36.696 --> 11:38.766
a stirry stick for the ladies?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.035
(grunts)

11:42.102 --> 11:43.971
I think I got
that knot out.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.272
Now, who's next?

11:45.338 --> 11:48.809
I will do feet as long
as you keep your socks on.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.443
(laughter)

11:50.510 --> 11:52.679
Okay, okay.
I never...

11:52.746 --> 11:56.283
let a guy
handcuff me to the bed.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.551
(laughter)

11:58.618 --> 12:00.420
(laughter continues)

12:00.487 --> 12:02.489
I have never slept
with Russian hockey team.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.524
Ha! I lie!

12:04.591 --> 12:05.959
I slept with them!

12:06.026 --> 12:08.528
It was miracle on ice!

12:08.595 --> 12:09.763
(laughter)

12:09.830 --> 12:12.199
Okay, okay, okay.
(clears throat)

12:12.265 --> 12:13.700
I never...

12:13.767 --> 12:16.503
got knocked up in high school.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.171
(laughter)

12:18.238 --> 12:19.940
Fine.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.111
I never...

12:24.177 --> 12:26.279
stole Delilah's teenage crush

12:26.346 --> 12:27.915
and rocked his world
in the wave pool

12:27.981 --> 12:29.983
until he forgot
she even existed!

12:30.050 --> 12:31.819
Oh, wait.
That's me again.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.220
(laughing)

12:35.588 --> 12:36.857
(clears throat)

12:36.924 --> 12:38.391
DELILAH:
Well, it certainly

12:38.458 --> 12:40.693
didn't work out better for me,
marrying a military hero

12:40.760 --> 12:42.362
who was the first one in

12:42.429 --> 12:44.764
when they found where Saddam
Hussein hid the crown jewels.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.333
(laughter, whooping)

12:46.399 --> 12:48.468
Don't tell me that
war was a mistake!

12:48.535 --> 12:50.370
(laughter continues)

12:50.437 --> 12:52.472
Don't worry, maybe you'll
get lucky and your husband

12:52.539 --> 12:55.175
will clean the pool
of an Iraqi dictator one day.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.744
(laughter)

12:57.811 --> 12:59.112
(mocking laughter)

13:00.413 --> 13:03.050
(laughter, whooping)

13:03.984 --> 13:05.418
I can't beat her.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.420
It's like every time
I make a joke,

13:07.487 --> 13:10.457
she turns it into a straight
line for an even better joke.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.425
It's like she has writers
or something.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.726
Let's get out of here.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.295
(knocking)

13:18.832 --> 13:20.000
Excuse me.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.669
We've had a noise complaint.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.371
It is way

13:24.437 --> 13:26.506
too quiet in here.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.709
(dance music playing)
(whooping, cheering)

13:29.776 --> 13:31.578
* *

13:39.219 --> 13:40.387
Oh, my God.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.189
The security guard
is also a stripper.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.157
Could it get any
cheesier than...

13:45.225 --> 13:47.294
Why can't I
stop dancing?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.865
And it's raining,
it's raining...

13:51.932 --> 13:54.367
and... it stops.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.469
Thank you for
the repeat business, sir.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.606
How's it going?
Decent.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.510
I've got a regular,
but his sweat smells
like shrimp scampi.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.478
Ah, I love shrimp scampi!

14:05.545 --> 14:06.746
How much you make?

14:06.813 --> 14:08.148
Uh, 14 bucks.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.683
We're never gonna get enough
for a wedding like this.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.819
We got to kick up
our game a little.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.923
(dance music playing)

14:21.828 --> 14:23.964
* *

14:24.031 --> 14:26.699
* You got to know
when to hold 'em *

14:26.766 --> 14:28.001
* When to hold 'em *

14:28.068 --> 14:29.269
* Know when to fold 'em *

14:29.336 --> 14:30.270
* When to fold 'em *

14:30.337 --> 14:32.672
* Know when to walk away *

14:32.739 --> 14:34.107
* Know when to run... *

14:34.174 --> 14:36.043
Hey! Get down
from there!

14:36.109 --> 14:37.877
Uh, I think it
might be time to run.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.619
* *

14:52.559 --> 14:55.595
Hey, hey. Natasha is next
for freaky dance, ah?
Hey

14:55.662 --> 14:58.065
Give me your phone.
I'll bet her Air Force pilot

14:58.131 --> 15:02.035
would be interested to see
who she's letting buzz
around her no-fly zone.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.371
* *

15:04.437 --> 15:06.706
I think maybe
we should get out of here

15:06.773 --> 15:09.276
and leave these two alone.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.510
Hey. Hey.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.981
* *

15:14.047 --> 15:16.749
(indistinct chatter)

15:16.816 --> 15:18.685
Where's Virginia?

15:20.153 --> 15:22.355
I'm want to get
my money's worth.

15:25.325 --> 15:26.659
(click)

15:31.131 --> 15:32.399
Well, it's over.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.701
I'm never gonna pay
for a wedding.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.903
It was a stupid idea, anyway.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.371
We only made 47 bucks.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.207
Well, it was
pretty exciting, though.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.942
When security was chasing us,
we ran up the down escalator.

15:43.010 --> 15:44.344
BURT:
That was cool.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.745
You see that stuff
happen in movies,

15:45.812 --> 15:47.847
but you never think it's
gonna happen to you.
Oh, great!

15:47.914 --> 15:50.083
Now you guys have a story
that has to stay in Vegas,

15:50.150 --> 15:52.552
and the craziest thing I've done
is have red wine with fish.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.356
That's, like, a thing
you're not supposed to...

15:56.423 --> 15:57.924
Never mind.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.427
I am so glad you guys are here

16:00.493 --> 16:01.361
to witness

16:01.428 --> 16:04.031
the greatest moment of my life.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.332
I had to hide under

16:05.398 --> 16:07.267
a very noisy bed
for about eight hours,

16:07.334 --> 16:09.802
(singsongy):
but look what I got!

16:09.869 --> 16:11.338
Oh, wait.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.939
There's a lot of
pictures of the wall.

16:13.006 --> 16:16.443
I didn't realize which
side the lens was facing.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.112
VIRGINIA:
Oh, here they come.
Watch this.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.815
I'm gonna get
a wedding canceled.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.317
I've got to get
to that waxing.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.519
I got to turn my peach
into a nectarine.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.520
Well, well,

16:27.587 --> 16:28.555
well.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.690
I am so glad to finally
meet the groom!

16:30.757 --> 16:31.724
You know,
I have some

16:31.791 --> 16:34.127
very funny pictures
of your bride-to-be,

16:34.194 --> 16:37.264
or not-to-be--
that is the question.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.266
This is Howard,
the best man.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.434
You met the groom
last night, silly.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.903
He's over there
paying the check.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.272
(giggles)

16:49.176 --> 16:51.578
Gosh, Virginia,
you look so shocked.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.114
Oh, I understand--
you've never seen a husband

16:54.181 --> 16:56.116
paying a check before,
have you?

16:56.183 --> 16:57.417
(laughs)
First time

16:57.484 --> 16:59.086
for everything.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.621
(exhales)

17:01.688 --> 17:03.523
* *

17:07.560 --> 17:09.229
(groans)

17:10.430 --> 17:12.665
I can't watch this.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.301
She's having our big,

17:14.367 --> 17:17.304
fancy wedding that we always
dreamed of as little girls.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.539
God, she wins at everything!

17:19.606 --> 17:22.575
I bet she'll even end up
doing our dream funeral, too,

17:22.642 --> 17:26.079
with a rhinestone coffin being
pulled by New Kids on the Block.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.280
Enjoy yourselves.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.549
I'm not going in.

17:30.950 --> 17:33.853
I need you two to do me a favor.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.956
("Bridal Chorus" playing)

* *

17:49.869 --> 17:52.539
(lively dance music playing)

17:59.879 --> 18:02.215
Not in the mood!

18:02.282 --> 18:03.183
Come with me.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.484
No. I'm not going in.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.853
Trust me.
It's a surprise.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.558
("Bridal Chorus" continues)

18:11.624 --> 18:13.460
* *

18:22.535 --> 18:24.437
* *

18:33.713 --> 18:35.081
What the hell's
going on?

18:35.148 --> 18:37.450
You're getting
your perfect wedding.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.321
* *

18:47.860 --> 18:48.995
(music ends)

18:49.061 --> 18:50.297
(whispers):
I need your ring.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.099
(soft gasp)

18:53.166 --> 18:56.303
JIMMY:
Dad wasn't able to buy Mom
the wedding they never had.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.306
MINISTER:
We are gathered here today
to join this couple

18:59.372 --> 19:00.940
in blessed matrimony.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.310
But that didn't mean
he couldn't steal it for her.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.279
Do you take this man,
for richer or poorer,

19:06.346 --> 19:08.515
through sickness and in health,

19:08.581 --> 19:11.651
to have and to hold
till death do you part?

19:11.718 --> 19:12.885
I do.

19:12.952 --> 19:13.786
I do.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.990
Turns out you don't
always have to spend money

19:18.057 --> 19:21.394
to give someone the day
they've always dreamed of.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.800
You may now kiss the bride.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.078

19:39.145 --> 19:42.549
(applause, cheering)

19:42.615 --> 19:44.751
MAN (over speakers):
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:44.817 --> 19:47.220
turn your attention
to the dance floor

19:47.287 --> 19:49.121
to see the happy couple

19:49.188 --> 19:52.492
in their first dance
as man and wife.

19:52.559 --> 19:56.529
(Peter Frampton's
"Baby I Love Your Way" plays)

19:56.596 --> 19:58.831
And now I'd like
to introduce

19:58.898 --> 20:01.401
my darling husband's
best man,

20:01.468 --> 20:03.470
a fella I would have married,

20:03.536 --> 20:05.705
but Howard here
mashed up his who-ha

20:05.772 --> 20:07.940
in a dirt bike accident.
(giggles)

20:08.007 --> 20:11.043
They gave him a fake one,
but no thanks!

20:11.110 --> 20:12.512
Take it away, Howie!

20:12.579 --> 20:14.681
And I'm just so thankful
you guys found each other,

20:14.747 --> 20:16.749
fell in love
and got pregnant with me.

20:16.816 --> 20:17.784
Thanks, son.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.721
It wasn't exactly
in that order, but thanks.

20:21.788 --> 20:25.992
* Ooh, baby
I love your way *

20:26.058 --> 20:29.629
There will always be a wedge
between my mom and Delilah,

20:29.696 --> 20:31.664
but at least Mom
would never feel

20:31.731 --> 20:33.533
like Delilah got
a better wedding, because...

20:33.600 --> 20:35.234
they got the same one.

20:35.302 --> 20:37.670
* Want to be with you
night and day *

20:37.737 --> 20:39.772
Everything worked out great
for Mom and Dad,

20:39.839 --> 20:42.975
but I still hadn't gotten to
see Sabrina do something crazy.

20:43.042 --> 20:47.113
Luckily, in Vegas, it's never
too late for crazy to happen.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.116
Never.

20:50.182 --> 20:53.620
I can't believe I never
got my something that
has to stay in Vegas.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.288
Well, what about us
slow-dancing?

20:55.355 --> 20:56.656
That was kind of crazy.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.492
That was twice, and
it was at a wedding.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.894
What if you did it a third time

21:01.961 --> 21:04.397
at a rooftop bar
to an upbeat song

21:04.464 --> 21:06.466
that really shouldn't
be slow-danced to?

21:06.533 --> 21:08.601
Oh, that would definitely
have to stay in Vegas.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.737
(quietly):
Come here.
(laughs)

21:10.803 --> 21:13.773
(up-tempo rock music playing)

21:22.349 --> 21:24.351

21:24.417 --> 21:26.386
Thanks.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.556
What are friends for?

21:35.328 --> 21:38.297
CHILD: Vegas, baby. Vegas.
