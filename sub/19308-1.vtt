01:11.239 --> 01:14.029
<i>That was my husband's Ford Galaxy.</i>

01:14.951 --> 01:18.041
<i>We drove Jamie home from</i>
the hospital in that car.

01:19.622 --> 01:21.922
<i>My mom was 40 when she had me.</i>

01:22.375 --> 01:24.585
<i>Everyone told her she was too old</i>
to be a mother.

01:25.962 --> 01:27.802
<i>I put my hand through the little window,</i>

01:27.881 --> 01:29.131
<i>and he'd squeeze my finger,</i>

01:29.215 --> 01:33.295
<i>and I'd tell him life was very big...</i>

01:34.429 --> 01:35.849
<i>and unknown.</i>

01:36.681 --> 01:38.771
<i>And she told me that there were animals</i>

01:38.850 --> 01:40.770
<i>and sky and cities...</i>

01:41.352 --> 01:43.732
<i>...music, movies.</i>

01:44.230 --> 01:45.270
<i>He'd fall in love,</i>

01:46.024 --> 01:49.744
<i>have his own children,</i>
have passions, have meaning,

01:50.069 --> 01:52.199
<i>have his mom and dad.</i>

01:53.198 --> 01:55.198
<i>When they got divorced,</i>

01:55.283 --> 01:57.623
<i>my father moved back east</i>
and left the car with us.

01:58.787 --> 02:00.577
<i>He calls on birthdays and Christmas.</i>

02:01.956 --> 02:05.916
<i>Last time I felt close to him</i>
was on my birthday in 1974.

02:06.836 --> 02:09.045
<i>He bought me mirrored sunglasses.</i>

02:10.381 --> 02:13.051
<i>I saw the president fall down the</i>
stairs...

02:14.177 --> 02:15.677
<i>and I threw up on the carpet.</i>

02:19.140 --> 02:21.640
<i>Since then it's just been us.</i>

02:21.726 --> 02:23.226
<i>I don't understand. What about you?</i>

02:23.311 --> 02:25.331
<i>I'm staying here with him 'til the plane</i>
gets safely away.

02:25.355 --> 02:27.105
<i>No, Richard, no.</i>
What has happened to you?

02:27.190 --> 02:29.820
<i>- Last night we...</i>
- Last night we said a great many things.

02:34.239 --> 02:37.529
Listen, Captain,
I am having a party tonight,

02:37.617 --> 02:38.907
it's my birthday actually,

02:39.202 --> 02:42.252
and I would like you to drop by
so I can feed you.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.870
It's not necessary, Mrs. Fields.

02:43.957 --> 02:47.417
No, Dorothea. No, I... I insist. Please?

02:47.961 --> 02:49.751
<i>That way I... I can thank you.</i>

02:50.630 --> 02:52.420
It was a beautiful car.

02:54.634 --> 02:56.394
Mom, it...

02:56.469 --> 02:58.929
smelled like gas
and overheated all the time...

03:00.223 --> 03:02.273
and it was just old.

03:03.643 --> 03:04.943
What?

03:08.314 --> 03:09.524
Well it wasn't always old.

03:09.858 --> 03:11.528
It just got that way all of a sudden.

03:12.277 --> 03:13.317
You know...

03:14.237 --> 03:15.657
when the firemen come...

03:16.948 --> 03:19.528
people don't usually
invite them over for dinner.

03:21.828 --> 03:23.328
Yeah? Why not?

03:37.135 --> 03:39.255
Why can't she just move on
and be happy with me

03:39.345 --> 03:42.845
rather than...
lingering on him?

03:43.182 --> 03:45.522
My mom just makes me feel
like I'm not good enough.

03:46.144 --> 03:48.614
It's just, I'm constantly
being compared to my dad.

04:45.787 --> 04:48.287
Oh, hey, sorry.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.246
Uh, Jamie's not here right now.

05:10.812 --> 05:12.362
They're not home.

05:13.398 --> 05:15.438
Don't.

05:17.068 --> 05:19.948
I'm taking a picture of everything
that happens to me in a day.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.782
I don't like having my pictures taken.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.450
I didn't happen to you.

05:34.377 --> 05:35.917
Hello?

05:36.587 --> 05:38.207
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:38.297 --> 05:39.837
Hi. Here.

05:41.634 --> 05:44.434
- You okay?
- You aren't gonna believe what happened.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.562
What?

05:45.888 --> 05:48.018
Our car burst into flames
in the parking lot.

05:48.433 --> 05:50.233
- It wh...
- Seriously?

05:50.309 --> 05:51.349
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

05:51.477 --> 05:52.517
You know, we're okay.

05:52.812 --> 05:54.732
- How did it happen?
- Well I don't know.

05:54.939 --> 05:57.399
They... they said it was probably
just something electrical.

05:57.483 --> 06:01.203
We walked out and it was
just sitting there... on fire.

06:01.279 --> 06:02.359
Oh, man.

06:03.156 --> 06:05.366
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.370
So... what happened?

06:11.080 --> 06:13.830
They never tell you anything,
I... They won't...

06:13.916 --> 06:16.206
I won't know anything for like a week.

06:16.294 --> 06:17.634
Oh.

06:20.048 --> 06:22.678
And I'm... I'm gonna be late on rent.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.216
That's okay. Don't worry about that.

06:26.095 --> 06:27.345
Thanks.

06:36.147 --> 06:37.437
Oh, God.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.862
What if you had been in the car?

06:43.571 --> 06:46.451
I wouldn't be here.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.288
You would've missed me?

06:53.623 --> 06:54.673
Don't joke.

07:07.762 --> 07:11.642
It was so much easier
before you got all horny.

07:16.187 --> 07:18.477
It... it's not like you don't...

07:19.524 --> 07:20.694
Do it?

07:25.404 --> 07:28.574
Friends can't have sex
and still be friends.

07:30.451 --> 07:33.371
I like us like we are, okay?

07:37.917 --> 07:39.457
Okay.

07:40.670 --> 07:41.710
Jamie!

07:42.130 --> 07:44.420
Could you come help me
set up, please?

07:45.633 --> 07:47.263
Can my mom just chill out?

07:48.261 --> 07:50.721
She's compensating for her loneliness.

07:53.349 --> 07:55.639
Dorothea, all that is really
beautiful molding there.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.621
- It is.
- I want to continue that around the side.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.475
Right so we're gonna
have to re-match that.

07:59.564 --> 08:01.364
Now is that...
is that actually wood...

08:01.440 --> 08:02.940
- That is wood.
- or is that plaster?

08:03.025 --> 08:04.525
No, the plaster is underneath it.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.360
The molding on the outside there is wood.

08:06.445 --> 08:07.565
- So...
- Okay.

08:07.655 --> 08:08.757
It's gonna take a little bit of time,
but...

08:08.781 --> 08:09.821
Well, we've got...

08:10.575 --> 08:11.615
Okay, no, it's good.

08:11.701 --> 08:14.831
Actually, it was, it was built in 1905,

08:14.912 --> 08:16.412
and the same family had it forever,

08:16.497 --> 08:18.617
but they lost all their money
during the war,

08:18.833 --> 08:20.213
and then there was a fire and...

08:20.835 --> 08:22.335
You should've been here for that.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.720
Anyway, so, it was just a mess.
They let it fall apart.

08:25.798 --> 08:28.218
Then a bohemian inherited it
in the '60s,

08:28.426 --> 08:31.296
then a bunch of free spirits moved in,
and they lost it to the bank.

08:31.387 --> 08:32.427
It's beautiful.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.467
Oh, I... I completely fell in love with it.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.880
We're connected to the dirt
'cause we came from the dirt.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.563
The dirt is made of stars and stardust,
in the same way we are,

08:40.645 --> 08:45.436
so when you put your hands
into that dirt

08:45.735 --> 08:47.815
and feel the Earth Mother...

08:51.657 --> 08:52.827
- Uh, William?
- Mm-hmm?

08:53.159 --> 08:55.699
It looks as though I'm gonna be
in need of a car.

08:55.786 --> 08:58.406
Do you think you have something
for me out there, cheap?

08:58.831 --> 09:01.041
Maybe that '49 Deluxe?

09:01.125 --> 09:03.705
I think we can work something out.

09:03.794 --> 09:05.764
Maybe we'll trade for rent or something.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.587
- Thank you.
- Sure.

09:10.301 --> 09:12.181
Okay. Got through that one.

09:13.137 --> 09:14.257
All right. Just, um...

09:14.889 --> 09:16.679
give me a minute and then come out.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.588
<i>My mom was born in 1924.</i>

09:50.466 --> 09:53.466
<i>When she was my age</i>
people drove in sad cars

09:53.552 --> 09:58.772
<i>to sad houses with old phones, no money,</i>
or food, or televisions...

09:59.850 --> 10:01.730
<i>but the people were real.</i>

10:02.520 --> 10:03.810
<i>When she was 16,</i>

10:04.355 --> 10:06.475
<i>the war broke out</i>
and she had to leave school.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.316
<i>Her dream was to be a pilot</i>
in the Air Force.

10:10.736 --> 10:12.446
<i>She actually went to flight school.</i>

10:12.863 --> 10:15.323
<i>But the war ended</i>
before she was done.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.037
<i>She became the first woman to work</i>

10:18.119 --> 10:20.329
<i>in the Continental Can Company</i>
drafting room.

10:22.081 --> 10:24.081
<i>Then she met my dad...</i>

10:24.834 --> 10:26.094
<i>and then I came.</i>

10:27.128 --> 10:28.878
<i>Then they got divorced.</i>

10:29.922 --> 10:33.762
<i>But people from her time</i>
never admit anything went wrong.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.760
- What do you mean?
- I'm sorry.

10:36.846 --> 10:40.216
He's too young to have an account
in his name only, little guy.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.136
No. He... he's a person.

10:42.226 --> 10:45.436
He's not half a person,
and he's not some cute little guy.

10:45.771 --> 10:48.691
He has volition and autonomy
and privacy.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.029
He needs a bank account.

10:50.735 --> 10:52.185
Can you do that for us?

10:53.279 --> 10:56.779
Now, Jamie, you can't just keep
skipping school and making excuses.

10:56.866 --> 10:59.536
Well wait a minute, why not?
Why can't he just skip school

11:00.369 --> 11:03.789
if he... if he has a legitimate
need to be away?

11:04.123 --> 11:06.583
Well, then I need a legitimate
real note from you...

11:07.001 --> 11:08.841
- Okay.
- with your real signature.

11:08.961 --> 11:12.921
Wow, how did you forge
my signature so well?

11:13.883 --> 11:15.383
That is ingenious!

11:16.719 --> 11:19.009
But you should never
forge someone's signature

11:19.138 --> 11:20.968
or do anything
behind someone's back.

11:22.433 --> 11:24.603
<i>Please excuse Jamie</i>
from school this morning.

11:24.685 --> 11:28.015
<i>He was doing volunteer work</i>
for the Sandinistas.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.484
<i>Please excuse Jamie</i>
from school this morning.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.566
<i>He was involved in</i>
a small plane accident.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.988
<i>Fortunately, he was not hurt.</i>

11:35.488 --> 11:38.738
You're gonna be in for
a legendary surprise.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.124
It's mahogany underneath.

11:40.326 --> 11:42.906
<i>She's always trying to</i>
bring a man into my life.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.785
This is probably Honduran mahogany.

11:45.456 --> 11:46.496
Really fine, very...

11:46.874 --> 11:49.844
- This is, like, really, really boring.
- Hey, come on, watch it.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.521
He's talking about, like, wood and stuff.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.665
He's helping me out.
Restore the house, okay?

11:53.756 --> 11:54.796
IBM?

11:55.216 --> 11:56.818
<i>She writes down her stocks every morning.</i>

11:56.842 --> 11:58.392
Two-hundred and thirteen point two.

11:59.011 --> 12:00.471
GE?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.640
Um, 51.62.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.941
<i>She smokes Salems</i>
because they're healthier,

12:06.018 --> 12:08.398
<i>wears Birkenstocks</i>
because she's contemporary.

12:09.605 --> 12:10.725
<i>She read</i> Watership Down

12:10.815 --> 12:13.605
<i>and learned how to carve rabbits</i>
out of wood.

12:14.985 --> 12:17.445
<i>And she never dates a man</i>
for very long.

12:19.115 --> 12:20.615
<i>Thank you, bye bye.</i>

12:20.866 --> 12:22.366
Good night, Dorothea.

12:22.743 --> 12:24.413
- Good night.
- Bye.

12:24.829 --> 12:25.869
So, I'll see ya later.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.814
Just don't hang out with
that Chris guy anymore, okay?

12:28.833 --> 12:30.883
- Good night.
- He's a skeez and he's kinda dumb.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.920
- Exactly.
- Good night, Dorothea.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.876
- Happy Birthday.
- Bye, Julie.

12:38.884 --> 12:39.934
Stop.

12:40.136 --> 12:41.636
What?

12:43.848 --> 12:45.888
Thinking that you know
everything that's going on.

12:45.975 --> 12:48.435
No, I don...
I just think that, you know,

12:48.519 --> 12:51.809
having your heart broken is a tremendous
way to learn about the world.

12:56.861 --> 12:58.151
Okay.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.579
Do you think you're happy?

13:04.702 --> 13:05.792
Like...

13:07.163 --> 13:09.793
as happy as you thought you'd be
when you were my age?

13:10.875 --> 13:11.915
Seriously?

13:12.126 --> 13:14.126
You don't ask people questions like that.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.419
You're my mom.

13:19.675 --> 13:20.715
Especially your mom.

13:21.135 --> 13:22.635
Look, wondering if you're happy

13:22.761 --> 13:24.891
is a great shortcut
to just being depressed.

13:25.139 --> 13:26.309
Give me that.

14:08.349 --> 14:10.019
What is that?

14:10.893 --> 14:12.813
It's The Raincoats.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.858
Can't things... just be pretty?

14:23.531 --> 14:27.241
"Pretty" music is used
to hide how unfair and corrupt society is.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.830
Ah.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.172
Okay, so...

14:34.083 --> 14:37.003
they're not very good,
and they know that, right?

14:37.419 --> 14:39.089
Yeah, it's...

14:39.922 --> 14:41.922
It's like they got all this,
this feeling,

14:42.508 --> 14:44.888
and they don't have any skill,
and they don't want skill,

14:44.969 --> 14:46.469
because it's really interesting

14:46.554 --> 14:51.184
what happens when your passion
is bigger than the tools

14:51.267 --> 14:52.977
you have to deal with it.

14:53.102 --> 14:57.442
It creates this energy
that's... that's... that's raw.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.982
Isn't it great?

15:17.293 --> 15:20.963
<i>My son was born in 1964.</i>

15:24.258 --> 15:26.588
<i>He grew up with a meaningless war...</i>

15:27.511 --> 15:31.271
<i>with protests, with Nixon...</i>

15:32.391 --> 15:34.691
<i>with nice cars and nice houses...</i>

15:35.269 --> 15:39.899
<i>computers, drugs, boredom.</i>

15:44.236 --> 15:47.196
<i>I know him less every day.</i>

15:52.745 --> 15:55.035
<i>He said it was just a game.</i>

15:55.998 --> 15:57.788
<i>You breathe real hard</i>
and another kid

16:06.008 --> 16:09.218
<i>He said you're supposed to come to</i>
a few seconds later...

16:09.303 --> 16:10.893
- Dude, can I try?
- Yeah.

16:10.971 --> 16:15.391
<i>but it took Jamie almost</i>
a half an hour to wake up.

16:29.448 --> 16:30.488
Going to get help!

16:48.217 --> 16:50.137
- You all right?
- He's fine.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.059
Can you tell me your name?

16:58.519 --> 16:59.559
Jamie Fields.

17:18.830 --> 17:19.961
You got lucky this time.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.286
Lack of oxygen to the brain
can cause brain damage,

17:24.002 --> 17:25.922
comas... even death.

17:31.260 --> 17:35.930
Jamie, why would you do something
so dangerous?

17:38.559 --> 17:40.519
I don't know. Um...

17:41.311 --> 17:43.191
I mean, everyone was doing it.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.185
So you just went along with it?

17:47.109 --> 17:49.279
- It looked like fun.
- That's just dumb.

17:49.361 --> 17:51.161
Why would you do something
so stupid?

17:51.613 --> 17:52.663
Just following along?

17:53.282 --> 17:55.912
You... you know you almost died, right?

17:56.076 --> 17:58.746
- You don't need to worry about me.
- Why didn't you think?

17:59.788 --> 18:01.578
Jamie! Hey!

18:04.042 --> 18:05.132
Jamie...

18:05.961 --> 18:08.461
What... what is going on?
What, why...

18:09.506 --> 18:12.006
What? You're not
gonna talk to me now?

18:14.386 --> 18:15.926
I'm not the one who doesn't talk.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.348
What? Come on.

18:19.057 --> 18:21.267
You scared the hell out of me!

18:22.227 --> 18:24.187
Why... why did you hurt yourself
like that?

18:24.563 --> 18:26.233
Why do you smoke yourself to death?

18:26.398 --> 18:27.688
Hey!

18:28.692 --> 18:32.112
Why are you fine being sad and alone?

18:34.198 --> 18:35.238
I, uh...

18:35.783 --> 18:39.543
I... You... You c...

18:40.037 --> 18:41.717
You can't talk to me like that.
We don't...

18:41.747 --> 18:43.827
You don't say that to me.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.015
and they can't figure out what's next.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.614
What are we talking about?

19:48.689 --> 19:49.729
Men?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.110
I think history and men?

19:52.192 --> 19:54.492
I mean who are your heroes nowadays?

19:54.736 --> 19:56.446
A bunch of privileged drug addicts?

19:56.572 --> 19:59.242
<i>I think maybe you guys</i>
can help me with Jamie.

19:59.533 --> 20:02.293
I think... he needs help...

20:03.078 --> 20:06.538
in figuring out how to be himself
in all this mess.

20:06.748 --> 20:08.458
And I can't be there.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.709
I can't be there with him.
I have to let go.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.591
Is this because of the fainting thing?

20:14.715 --> 20:16.335
- He's fine.
- No.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.257
It's because of everything.

20:20.304 --> 20:22.514
I don't understand what...
What are you asking?

20:23.473 --> 20:24.813
Well, how do you be a good man?

20:26.351 --> 20:28.271
What does that even mean nowadays?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.056
He's... he's only got me.
It's just...

20:31.857 --> 20:33.687
Think about it. It's not enough.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.692
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.487
What about William?
William's a guy. That's...

20:38.572 --> 20:41.282
He can talk to him about guy things.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.236
Have you ever seen them
have a conversation?

20:43.327 --> 20:45.367
They have nothing in common.
They don't connect.

20:45.454 --> 20:47.794
It's just not working.
I mean, I thought about that.

20:47.956 --> 20:48.996
He...

20:50.250 --> 20:53.340
Well, he likes you and you.
He likes you a lot.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.024
- That... that's...
- He's my friend.

20:55.047 --> 20:56.337
I don't want to be his mom.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.839
Yeah, no. I'm his mom.

20:59.468 --> 21:03.218
I mean don't you need a man
to raise a man?

21:04.765 --> 21:06.345
No. I don't think so.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.307
I mean,

21:08.602 --> 21:11.522
I think you're what's gonna work for him.

21:15.150 --> 21:18.860
I mean... you know him better than anyone.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.454
You know that, and...

21:21.531 --> 21:25.201
you care about him.
You can watch out for him.

21:25.410 --> 21:30.170
And you just share your life.
You're a talented person.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.690
Show him what you're interested in.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.630
You know, he would be lucky to have that.

21:52.104 --> 21:53.154
Help me with what?

21:53.563 --> 21:56.363
Oh, go through this part of your life.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.401
It's not easy. It's not easy for anybody.

21:59.820 --> 22:01.450
- You asked them to help me?
- Yeah.

22:02.239 --> 22:04.409
No, they... they get it.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.334
So they said yes?

22:07.577 --> 22:08.947
Yeah.

22:09.371 --> 22:10.751
- Fuck.
- Hey!

22:11.873 --> 22:14.633
You just feel guilty
'cause it's just me and you.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.169
You don't know what I'm feeling.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.337
Just tell me.

22:22.217 --> 22:24.337
Kid...

22:24.428 --> 22:27.678
You never tell me what you're gonna do.
You just do it.

22:43.321 --> 22:45.321
I got the keys to my stepmom's car.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.447
I'm going to The Starwood.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.794
Tanya and Michelle
are both gonna be there.

22:51.121 --> 22:52.291
Hey, you guys going to LA?

22:53.457 --> 22:55.577
Yeah, I am.

22:57.169 --> 22:58.209
Can I come?

23:00.047 --> 23:02.417
...kissed a girl? Are you ready?

23:03.300 --> 23:05.840
Are you gonna... are you gonna
get with some chick there?

23:29.493 --> 23:30.793
That was Jamie.

23:31.536 --> 23:34.036
He is in, uh, LA.

23:34.331 --> 23:36.881
He and some friends went to a show.

23:38.502 --> 23:41.512
- Oh.
- Yeah. He wanted me to tell you.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.009
Okay.

23:52.432 --> 23:54.102
Aren't you worried or...

23:57.395 --> 23:59.895
He's mad at me and this is his way
of dealing with it...

24:01.233 --> 24:03.283
and he has every right to be mad.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.992
Yeah, but if it makes him this mad,

24:07.197 --> 24:09.567
then maybe it wasn't a good idea.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.201
- With the kid, I mean.
- Yeah, I know.

24:56.288 --> 24:59.248
I think that Jamie's energy
is very...

25:01.835 --> 25:03.455
unstable.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.172
Yeah. Well, you're right.

25:07.257 --> 25:08.837
Then, though,
there's an energy crisis.

25:08.925 --> 25:14.005
Maybe that plays into it in some way.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.519
I'm sorry.

25:19.186 --> 25:21.856
You don't have very many

25:25.442 --> 25:26.692
Okay.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.604
Jamie?

26:04.564 --> 26:06.074
Jamie?

26:29.673 --> 26:30.763
Hey.

26:31.508 --> 26:32.758
Hey.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.718
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

26:36.471 --> 26:37.681
Can I come in?

26:38.974 --> 26:40.184
Sure.

26:43.979 --> 26:46.729
So I had this new idea
for... for my photography

26:46.815 --> 26:51.485
that I was gonna take a picture
of everything that I owned

26:51.569 --> 26:56.779
so it would be a self-portrait of myself
through the stuff that I have.

27:00.704 --> 27:01.754
Can I show you?

27:02.247 --> 27:06.037
That's a bra, birth control,

27:06.710 --> 27:11.510
um, photography by Susan Sontag,
shoes, underwear,

27:12.299 --> 27:13.799
a picture of a picture of my mom.

27:14.926 --> 27:17.136
I'm gonna do a bunch of 'em.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.983
It's a little bit... It's a little bit sad.

27:26.104 --> 27:27.774
You know, all this stuff together.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.864
I don't know why that is.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.150
Not... I mean...

27:33.903 --> 27:35.323
Do you know what I mean?

27:36.531 --> 27:38.331
It's really beautiful, Abbie.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.830
Do you want to fool around...
with me?

27:45.081 --> 27:46.421
Really?

27:47.917 --> 27:49.167
Yeah.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.800
Yeah.

27:55.300 --> 27:56.720
I do.

28:00.555 --> 28:03.845
You know, I'm recovering
from cervical cancer.

28:07.479 --> 28:08.729
I know.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.500
Your hair smells good.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.168
I make my own shampoo.

28:34.422 --> 28:35.882
Of course you do.

29:04.119 --> 29:05.159
Oh.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.001
It's okay, Jeeves, he's back.

29:08.081 --> 29:10.041
You can relax now.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.429
Where were you?

29:25.640 --> 29:26.680
I went to The Starwood.

29:27.475 --> 29:31.435
Saw a show in LA. Had a lot of fun.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.146
Are you drunk?

29:42.824 --> 29:44.124
Don't.

29:48.371 --> 29:49.661
What's wrong?

29:52.542 --> 29:54.542
Tim Trammer came inside me.

29:58.882 --> 30:01.012
I don't want to hear this shit.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.722
<i>We broke</i>
into that old pool at the rec center.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.595
<i>Got loaded.</i>

30:08.641 --> 30:10.141
<i>Fucked around.</i>

30:12.228 --> 30:14.898
<i>And me and Tim ended up</i>
in his mom's Maverick.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.073
Did you just cum?

30:24.115 --> 30:25.735
Yeah.

30:27.952 --> 30:29.582
You said you'd pull out.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.998
Yeah.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.997
Sorry.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.884
I thought we had a deal there.

30:42.592 --> 30:43.932
Fuck.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.721
What are you gonna do?

30:52.560 --> 30:54.230
It'll be fine.

31:10.995 --> 31:13.825
Your mom asked me to, like,
help raise you.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.337
Yeah, I know.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.511
She was raised in The Depression.

31:24.425 --> 31:25.965
Everyone helped raise everyone.

31:26.344 --> 31:28.724
You know,
the whole neighborhood raised the kids.

31:30.014 --> 31:31.604
Sorry.

31:34.936 --> 31:35.976
Can we do therapy?

31:37.063 --> 31:39.363
Jesus, I don't want
to do therapy right now.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.980
- Let's just role play.
- Please, no.

31:41.067 --> 31:44.147
I'll be your mom, and you can tell her
what you want to tell her.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.860
Just do it.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.093
I don't want to talk to my mom right now.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.157
What would you say to her?

31:53.162 --> 31:54.832
Okay.

31:59.085 --> 32:01.375
I don't need your help, Mom.

32:02.463 --> 32:04.093
I've got it.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.089
I'm okay.

32:09.929 --> 32:12.849
Um, I'm gonna need a story.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.348
What?

32:14.809 --> 32:15.849
A story.

32:16.311 --> 32:18.101
- What do you mean?
- Like a... a story.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.113
Um... where... I'm...

32:25.069 --> 32:27.359
I'm just a normal woman,

32:28.197 --> 32:30.617
and you're a photographer,

32:30.992 --> 32:35.202
and so you're photographing me,
but while you're doing it...

32:36.956 --> 32:40.836
you can't help yourself,
and you start touching me.

32:41.836 --> 32:45.046
And you touch me...

32:46.132 --> 32:52.722
and you say...
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

32:55.099 --> 32:56.269
Really?

32:57.727 --> 32:59.727
I can't just be myself?

33:03.524 --> 33:04.944
No.

33:06.569 --> 33:07.963
Okay, so... Do I just, uh...
- Okay.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.447
Hey, nice to meet you.
- Oh, Hi.

33:10.239 --> 33:13.949
Do I just look in the camera,
or should I look... off to the side?

33:14.035 --> 33:16.075
Let's start that way,
looking in the camera.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.212
Okay. Should I smile?

33:18.081 --> 33:19.461
- Do you like to smile?
- Yeah.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.086
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:22.919 --> 33:23.959
Uh, oh, you took it.

33:24.253 --> 33:26.023
I thought you were gonna
say like, "One, two, three..."

33:26.047 --> 33:27.087
- No.
- Okay.

33:27.340 --> 33:29.010
- I just wait for the moment.
- Okay.

33:29.133 --> 33:30.933
- I just have to fix something.
- Okay.

33:31.469 --> 33:32.759
- Just right here.
- Um, oh.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.433
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God. No, it's all right.

33:35.515 --> 33:38.975
I don't mind. I'm just...
Never done this before.

33:39.060 --> 33:44.440
I, um, so I'm just a little bit nervous,
but, um, I can, um,

33:44.524 --> 33:47.114
wear my hair differently if you want.
- Abbie...

33:48.903 --> 33:50.203
Yeah?

33:52.532 --> 33:54.162
I'm sorry.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.995
I'm really sorry.

34:18.683 --> 34:22.023
<i>Julie and I</i>
have been friends since we were little.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.647
<i>She likes to say</i>
she's self-destructive.

34:30.485 --> 34:31.696
<i>Her mother is a therapist.</i>

34:32.237 --> 34:33.277
We used to talk and I...

34:34.322 --> 34:37.453
had a better sense of what was going on
with you. I worry that...

34:38.077 --> 34:40.867
<i>She makes Julie attend</i>
her teen group sessions.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.324
<i>How about the possibility...</i>

34:43.958 --> 34:46.628
that you're choosing boys
who are inappropriate...

34:47.085 --> 34:48.126
unconsciously?

34:49.630 --> 34:51.590
<i>When her mother remarried, Julie changed.</i>

34:51.674 --> 34:53.194
I love this shirt! Don't get me wrong...

34:53.217 --> 34:54.547
<i>When her half-sister Amanda</i>

34:54.635 --> 34:58.055
<i>was born with cerebral palsy,</i>
she changed more.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.811
Wow, it looks really pretty on you.

35:02.226 --> 35:05.016
Brings... Just... just makes
your whole face pop.

35:05.855 --> 35:06.895
Like soda. Like pop.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.453
<i>She started fooling around.</i>

35:21.287 --> 35:23.457
<i>She started</i>
sneaking into my house.

35:24.624 --> 35:26.134
<i>Sleeping over.</i>

35:27.627 --> 35:28.787
Why'd you do it?

35:29.253 --> 35:30.673
'Cause I'm crazy.

35:33.591 --> 35:35.381
You wish you were crazy.

35:39.472 --> 35:41.022
Scratch me.

35:44.393 --> 35:46.903
We should go
up the coast somewhere.

35:48.314 --> 35:49.364
Just me and you.

35:52.235 --> 35:55.025
<i>Julie works at the La Cumbre Plaza mall.</i>

35:55.112 --> 36:00.162
Spring Rain features cinnamon, jasmine,
lily of the valley and rose.

36:01.536 --> 36:03.156
<i>"Sex is a commitment.</i>

36:03.246 --> 36:05.616

<i>and when you give yourself,</i>
both mentally and physically,

36:08.751 --> 36:10.381
<i>well, you're completely vulnerable."</i>

36:10.461 --> 36:13.171
All he cares about is his new wife,
and her birthday,

36:13.631 --> 36:15.471
and Christmas with her
and her family,

36:16.676 --> 36:19.006
and inviting all of her family to our...

36:26.060 --> 36:28.270
<i>"Of all the misconceptions about love,</i>

36:28.354 --> 36:29.984
<i>the most powerful and persuasive</i>

36:30.314 --> 36:32.324
<i>is the belief</i>
that falling in love is love,

36:34.277 --> 36:36.987
<i>or at least one of the</i>
manifestations of love."

36:38.239 --> 36:40.619
<i>Love is supposed to be</i>
a feeling that you feel.

36:41.075 --> 36:44.945
People say that they're falling in love,
but they're not actually falling in love.

36:46.247 --> 36:48.747
It's a fake connection
that you feel with someone...

36:49.375 --> 36:51.205
and marriage should never happen.

36:51.627 --> 36:55.127
You should have died.
It should have been you!

36:56.424 --> 36:57.474
Die!

37:40.426 --> 37:41.466
Hey, Julie.

37:42.261 --> 37:44.061
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:44.805 --> 37:47.595
So come on in. It's okay. Come in.

37:48.309 --> 37:51.269
He's not up yet. He, uh...
- Yeah.

37:51.354 --> 37:52.564
Yeah, he got in kinda late.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.439
Okay, you wanna help me
bring this stuff in?

38:01.364 --> 38:03.534
So is, uh, Jamie okay?

38:03.824 --> 38:06.294
Yeah, he's okay.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.293
Yeah, I... I heard him come in last night.

38:09.663 --> 38:11.463
- Oh.
- I was... I was awake.

38:12.291 --> 38:13.331
Right.

38:13.542 --> 38:16.842
Yeah, I was just...
Couldn't sleep, so I was...

38:18.589 --> 38:20.759
you know, listening for him.

38:35.064 --> 38:36.444
How was the show?

38:37.441 --> 38:38.731
It was good.

38:39.860 --> 38:42.820
Next time you take a trip
just let me know, okay?

38:42.905 --> 38:45.315
I won't make too much dinner.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.375
Hey, do the stocks with me?

38:59.672 --> 39:00.882
Here.

39:06.262 --> 39:07.892
Okay. IBM?

39:10.057 --> 39:12.937
IBM, 69.73.

39:13.477 --> 39:16.477
Xerox? You okay?

39:19.108 --> 39:21.398
Xerox, 53.92.

39:21.485 --> 39:22.525
- Stop.
- Okay.

39:23.279 --> 39:25.569
Fifty-three point nine two.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.405
Listen.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.473
Abbie has her appointment today
and I can't be here.

39:29.493 --> 39:30.543
I have to go to work,

39:30.661 --> 39:32.661
so I was hoping that maybe
you could be here

39:33.330 --> 39:36.210
when she gets back
in case she needs some support.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.590
She's going through a lot.

39:39.503 --> 39:43.423
Okay, well, like, what if it's,
like, bad news or something?

39:44.550 --> 39:45.680
Well, you can handle it.

39:46.135 --> 39:49.555
Or if you can't,
you have to start somewhere.

39:51.348 --> 39:53.638
Men always feel like
they have to fix things

39:53.726 --> 39:55.636
for women
or they're not doing anything,

39:55.728 --> 39:58.858
but some things just can't be fixed.

39:58.981 --> 40:00.321
Just be there.

40:01.233 --> 40:03.443
Somehow that's hard for all of you.

40:05.404 --> 40:08.954
Mom, I'm not "all men."
Okay? I'm just me.

40:09.950 --> 40:12.370
Well, yes and no.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.581
What if I have to have full-on chemo...

40:19.502 --> 40:21.632
or get a hysterectomy?

40:22.421 --> 40:24.301
Do you know what that is?

40:26.509 --> 40:28.889
Look, I should just
go with you, you know? I mean...

40:35.100 --> 40:38.150
Your mom did tell me
to share my life with you.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.188
Yeah, I know.

40:42.316 --> 40:44.356
You don't...

40:44.443 --> 40:45.903
Don't worry about her.
She's...

40:46.153 --> 40:47.783
she's from The Depression.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.540
Yeah.

40:57.623 --> 40:59.923
It's good news, Abbie.

41:01.627 --> 41:03.087
There were no malignant cells.

41:03.963 --> 41:05.633
Your biopsy's benign.

41:09.552 --> 41:12.472
And in the future?

41:13.973 --> 41:17.273
There was damage to the muscle wall,
from the surgery.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.765
You have an incompetent cervix.

41:30.739 --> 41:32.449
Incompetent?

41:33.701 --> 41:36.541
It may not be strong enough
to go full term during pregnancy.

41:37.496 --> 41:40.536
As the baby grows, the cervix widens.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.960
If it's weakened, it's likely
to open prematurely.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.047
I'm gonna be okay.

41:56.390 --> 41:59.230
He said that I probably
can't have kids.

42:05.858 --> 42:07.688
<i>Was having Jamie, like...</i>

42:08.777 --> 42:11.067
the biggest thing
that ever happened to you?

42:16.160 --> 42:17.620
I guess so.

42:19.913 --> 42:22.123
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

42:27.630 --> 42:29.670
You'll get through this.

42:31.675 --> 42:33.545
You will get through it.

42:34.595 --> 42:36.465
You will do it.

42:40.059 --> 42:43.729
You'll... This is the really hard part.
And then what happens is,

42:44.104 --> 42:47.114
there's a hard part
and then it gets better.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.569
And then it gets hard again,
but never mind.

42:54.156 --> 42:55.866
I shouldn't have told you that part.

42:56.742 --> 43:00.332
I should have just said it gets better
and then that's it, but...

43:01.121 --> 43:02.161
You got birds?

43:02.873 --> 43:03.923
Is that okay?

43:04.333 --> 43:05.383
Yeah.

43:08.420 --> 43:09.920
So did you name them?

43:10.506 --> 43:11.546
Not yet.

43:12.132 --> 43:14.222
They're a boy and a girl,
and...

43:14.301 --> 43:16.511
that they're monogamous
for life, so if...

43:18.639 --> 43:20.639
one of them dies, then the other one...

43:21.684 --> 43:23.694
will die like a week later.

43:23.977 --> 43:25.647
Wow.

43:27.356 --> 43:29.316
Well how 'bout
Maximilian and Carlotta?

43:30.567 --> 43:31.607
I... I...

43:32.403 --> 43:33.903
You know,
they deserve something grand

43:33.987 --> 43:37.317
if they're gonna be monogamous
their whole lives.

43:37.408 --> 43:39.868
Right?

43:41.787 --> 43:45.867
Aw.

43:48.794 --> 43:52.424
Max and Carlotta are really good names.

43:54.174 --> 43:57.264
So, um, you...

43:57.344 --> 44:00.514
you went to the doctor's
and you waited with her.

44:02.015 --> 44:03.385
Yeah.

44:04.685 --> 44:07.095
But I... I told you to wait here.

44:07.396 --> 44:08.436
I, um,

44:08.814 --> 44:10.774
I thought it'd be better to, uh, go and...

44:11.734 --> 44:12.784
really be there.

44:13.777 --> 44:15.147
Wow.

44:17.573 --> 44:19.493
She's really upset.

44:22.202 --> 44:24.002
That must have been a lot to deal with.

44:24.747 --> 44:26.167
I'm fine.

44:26.749 --> 44:27.999
I'm good.

44:29.126 --> 44:31.586
I... I learned a lot.

44:35.174 --> 44:36.384
Abigail Porter?

44:43.182 --> 44:44.682
<i>"Home pregnancy tests</i>

44:44.767 --> 44:46.477
<i>that women can do safely and easily.</i>

44:47.853 --> 44:51.363
<i>A small revolution for women</i>
seeking to take control of their lives."

45:11.710 --> 45:13.550
What the fuck is this?

45:14.296 --> 45:16.876
It's a pregnancy test.

45:22.471 --> 45:23.511
Um,

45:23.931 --> 45:25.391
Abbie's doctor said that, uh,

45:26.391 --> 45:28.941
she wouldn't be able to have kids.

45:31.230 --> 45:33.230
Why'd she take you?

45:37.820 --> 45:39.610
- Is that all of it?
- Yeah.

45:40.906 --> 45:42.316
That's a lot.

45:42.866 --> 45:45.036
- Now what?
- Um...

45:45.786 --> 45:47.786
"Shake for ten seconds."

45:56.839 --> 45:58.469
Okay, um...

46:03.804 --> 46:07.474
Um... "Leave undisturbed for two hours."

46:09.268 --> 46:11.228
Two hours?

46:12.771 --> 46:14.271
That's what it says.

46:18.277 --> 46:21.357
Okay, if it appears, then you're positive,

46:21.446 --> 46:24.906
and if no ring appears here,
then the test is negative.

46:30.289 --> 46:31.499
What do we do for two hours?

46:37.045 --> 46:38.335
Guys don't smoke like that.

46:38.797 --> 46:39.837
Don't hold it like that.

46:39.923 --> 46:42.893
Like... this,

46:43.260 --> 46:44.470
between your two fingers.

46:44.970 --> 46:46.930
- That?
- Yeah. That's better.

46:51.101 --> 46:52.391
Okay now walk. Do like a...

46:53.145 --> 46:55.355
a cool cigarette walk.

47:04.114 --> 47:05.434
Guys aren't supposed to look like

47:05.490 --> 47:07.830
they're thinking about
what they look like.

47:09.953 --> 47:11.333
Watch me.

47:19.212 --> 47:20.552
See?

47:21.173 --> 47:24.093
Smoking's gross.

47:24.509 --> 47:26.179
No, it's not.

47:28.013 --> 47:29.063
It gives you cancer.

47:31.391 --> 47:32.521
This is just my opinion.

47:32.726 --> 47:35.016
I think being strong
is the most important quality.

47:35.103 --> 47:38.693
It's not being vulnerable,
it's not being sensitive.

47:38.982 --> 47:41.742
It's not even...
Honestly, it's not even being happy.

47:42.653 --> 47:43.703
It's about strength

47:44.446 --> 47:47.736
<i>and your durability</i>
against the other emotions.

47:58.085 --> 47:59.745
No ring.

48:01.004 --> 48:02.804
No ring.

48:11.223 --> 48:13.353
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:15.686 --> 48:17.346
Thanks for coming with me.

48:17.980 --> 48:19.310
Yeah, totally.

48:20.357 --> 48:22.027
I made you this.

48:23.193 --> 48:24.323
- It's a mix tape.
- Yep.

48:25.612 --> 48:28.162
<i>These were a bunch of songs that...</i>

48:28.240 --> 48:31.240
<i>I think my life</i>
would have been better

48:31.576 --> 48:35.286
<i>if they had been around</i>
when I was a teenager.

48:35.580 --> 48:38.790
<i>So I'm hoping that</i>
if you listen to them now,

48:39.209 --> 48:42.169
<i>you will be a happier</i>
and more realized person

48:42.254 --> 48:45.844
<i>than I could ever hope to be.</i>

48:51.805 --> 48:53.305
<i>From that night on...</i>

48:53.390 --> 48:55.890
<i>Abbie started telling me everything.</i>

48:57.102 --> 49:00.112
<i>She grew up in Santa Barbara</i>
where everyone is happy,

49:00.355 --> 49:02.475
<i>but that just made her feel crazy.</i>

49:04.609 --> 49:08.069
<i>In 1973, she moved to New York City</i>
and went to art school.

49:09.156 --> 49:11.696
<i>New York City made her feel sane.</i>

49:11.867 --> 49:13.617
<i>It was so fucked up.</i>

49:14.536 --> 49:16.706
<i>She fell in love with photography.</i>

49:17.873 --> 49:19.673
<i>She learned to dance when she got sad.</i>

49:21.126 --> 49:24.916
<i>She saw</i> The Man Who Fell to Earth
<i>and dyed her hair red.</i>

49:25.047 --> 49:27.417
<i>I figured out how to be looked at</i>

49:27.966 --> 49:29.006
by men,

49:30.052 --> 49:34.432
and how to make them excited,

49:34.848 --> 49:36.888
<i>and uncomfortable.</i>

49:37.559 --> 49:38.599
<i>I was so cocky,</i>

49:39.061 --> 49:40.771
<i>and I was so angry</i>

49:41.313 --> 49:44.073
and I was so happy.

49:47.319 --> 49:49.739
<i>She fell in love with her teacher.</i>

49:56.661 --> 49:58.461
<i>Then she went</i>
to Planned Parenthood.

49:58.997 --> 50:00.457
Abigail Porter?

50:04.127 --> 50:07.047
<i>Her friends couldn't</i>
deal with her having cancer,

50:07.130 --> 50:09.050
<i>so she went home to her mom.</i>

50:09.132 --> 50:10.222
Hey, Mom...

50:11.051 --> 50:12.681
<i>Gail, did you ever take...</i>

50:12.761 --> 50:15.971
D.E.S. when you were pregnant with Abbie?

50:16.932 --> 50:18.102
Yes.

50:19.184 --> 50:24.024
I had two miscarriages before Abbie.
The doctor told me to take it.

50:25.107 --> 50:28.607
<i>D.E.S. was a fertility medication.</i>

50:28.693 --> 50:31.533
<i>Doctors prescribed it to women.</i>

50:31.655 --> 50:34.275
<i>Later they found out</i>
that the daughters

50:34.366 --> 50:37.736
<i>of the women who took it</i>
got cervical cancer.

50:38.286 --> 50:41.206
I didn't know that
you had miscarriages.

50:43.834 --> 50:44.924
<i>When her mom found out</i>

50:45.001 --> 50:46.631
<i>it was because she took that drug,</i>

50:47.212 --> 50:48.512
<i>she wouldn't talk about it.</i>

50:49.631 --> 50:52.721
<i>And everything Abbie did made her mad.</i>

50:53.927 --> 50:56.347
<i>So Abbie looked</i>
for another place to live.

50:58.598 --> 50:59.638
- Hi. Hello...
- Hi.

51:00.225 --> 51:03.225
<i>And she started renting the room upstairs.</i>

51:03.645 --> 51:04.725
I'm Abbie.

51:05.730 --> 51:07.690
<i>And she got a job at the news press.</i>

51:07.774 --> 51:08.824
...the landslide.

51:09.276 --> 51:11.066
It shows how erosion along the bluff,

51:11.611 --> 51:14.741
it causes instantaneous
loss of oceanfront property

51:14.823 --> 51:15.953
and... and construction.

51:17.033 --> 51:18.333
Over time, it gradually...

51:30.422 --> 51:31.972
Hi, Dorothea.

51:32.424 --> 51:34.224
Hey, Charlie.

51:40.140 --> 51:43.020
Hey... um...

51:45.228 --> 51:46.438
You wanna go out some time?

51:47.189 --> 51:48.819
Get a drink?

51:49.566 --> 51:51.736
Oh, um...

51:54.112 --> 51:55.782
Yeah.

51:57.199 --> 51:59.869
What the heck, Charlie?

51:59.951 --> 52:02.081
Sure. Okay.

52:02.245 --> 52:04.155
I wasn't sure.

52:04.247 --> 52:05.827
- Uh...
- What?

52:06.458 --> 52:09.418
Some... some of the guys
thought you were a lesbian.

52:09.502 --> 52:13.672
You know, which, look,
I don't have a problem with if you are,

52:13.924 --> 52:15.684
but you're not.

52:16.218 --> 52:18.178
Yeah, no, I am not.

52:22.390 --> 52:24.180
Um, should we go out then?

52:26.436 --> 52:28.306
Okay, yeah. Sure.

52:28.396 --> 52:32.436
You wanna come to dinner
at my house again some time?

52:34.194 --> 52:35.364
You could...

52:35.737 --> 52:37.277
We could do that.

53:11.231 --> 53:13.781
Shit. Julie.

53:27.414 --> 53:29.124
<i>It's really-It's nothing.</i>

53:29.291 --> 53:31.291
<i>I just end up there sometimes.</i>

53:32.669 --> 53:34.339
What do you guys do?

53:35.046 --> 53:36.296
I just sleep.

53:36.965 --> 53:38.165
We talk.

53:44.723 --> 53:46.143
Can I have one?

53:47.350 --> 53:48.810
No, they're really bad for you.

53:50.145 --> 53:51.345
You smoke all the time.

53:52.230 --> 53:54.360
You know when I started,
they weren't bad for you.

53:54.441 --> 53:56.741
They were just stylish, sort of edgy,

53:56.818 --> 53:59.698
so it's different for me.

54:05.952 --> 54:07.292
Okay.

54:16.546 --> 54:18.166
You're good at hiding stuff, huh?

54:19.424 --> 54:21.894
My mom calls it compartmentalizing.

54:22.552 --> 54:24.392
Apparently, I do that a lot.

54:29.142 --> 54:30.642
Are you helping him?

54:33.396 --> 54:35.516
- I'm trying.
- Really?

54:37.734 --> 54:38.784
What about you?

54:39.402 --> 54:41.992
Have you thought about your impact on him?

54:43.323 --> 54:45.413
It's always about the mother.

54:47.369 --> 54:48.409
Like...

54:48.578 --> 54:51.368
do you think you've moved on
since his dad?

54:52.749 --> 54:54.959
You know that you're
not actually a therapist?

54:58.755 --> 55:00.965
I've had new guys, okay?

55:03.468 --> 55:05.388
No one appropriate.

55:06.930 --> 55:08.310
Appropriate?

55:10.975 --> 55:13.685
Guys you're not
gonna risk anything with...

55:15.730 --> 55:17.400
men you don't even really like.

55:18.400 --> 55:20.990
Listen, you're 17, okay?

55:21.194 --> 55:23.744
Maybe you don't know
what's good about these guys

55:23.822 --> 55:25.492
that I really like.

55:27.575 --> 55:28.615
I'm talking about you.

55:29.953 --> 55:32.213
You never seem into it...

55:33.289 --> 55:35.169
except for with William.

55:37.127 --> 55:38.497
But...

55:39.546 --> 55:41.296
he's inappropriate.

55:43.842 --> 55:47.052
Okay, Jesus. Uh, yeah.

55:50.056 --> 55:52.556
It's hard to find someone that I like.

55:54.477 --> 55:56.267
I... I had my chance twice,

55:56.354 --> 55:59.614
but that part of life
just didn't work out for me.

56:09.701 --> 56:11.621
- Bye.
- Bye.

56:48.156 --> 56:49.486
Where were you?

56:51.659 --> 56:53.579
I had some errands.

56:56.539 --> 56:57.579
You did the whole list.

56:58.666 --> 56:59.786
You know all the stocks?

57:00.502 --> 57:01.752
Yeah.

57:03.713 --> 57:06.423
IBM is down, huh?

57:06.591 --> 57:07.931
Sorry. I'll fix it next time.

57:09.385 --> 57:11.755
That...
Good job on that.

57:27.779 --> 57:29.909
- William?
- Yes?

57:31.699 --> 57:33.619
Do I seem stuck to you?

57:37.580 --> 57:38.960
How do you mean?

57:43.044 --> 57:45.714
Well, I, I guess
I wouldn't know, would I?

57:51.970 --> 57:53.810
- Abbie?
- Yes?

57:54.973 --> 57:57.273
Let's go out tonight.

57:58.059 --> 58:00.979
I want to see this modern world.

58:04.190 --> 58:05.440
Can I come?

58:25.545 --> 58:28.755
I don't know if I'm gonna find
an appropriate man here.

58:29.966 --> 58:31.426
Thank you.

58:42.061 --> 58:43.651
What?

58:54.907 --> 58:55.947
What was that?

58:56.701 --> 58:58.331
What does that mean?

58:59.203 --> 59:03.293
Oh... Um... Uh...

59:03.708 --> 59:04.998
I mean you don't kiss a woman

59:05.209 --> 59:07.419
unless you know
what you mean by it.

59:13.426 --> 59:15.256
Aren't you sleeping with Abbie?

59:17.513 --> 59:20.603
That's not something serious.
It's...

59:22.644 --> 59:24.234
Then why do it?

59:57.136 --> 59:58.806
<i>It's 1979.</i>

59:59.097 --> 01:00:00.927
<i>I'm 55 years old.</i>

01:00:01.307 --> 01:00:03.307
<i>This is what my son believes in.</i>

01:00:04.268 --> 01:00:05.308
<i>These people...</i>

01:00:06.187 --> 01:00:07.977
<i>with this hair...</i>

01:00:08.272 --> 01:00:09.442
<i>and these clothes...</i>

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:13.282
<i>making these gestures,</i>
making these sounds.

01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:18.069
<i>It's 1979. I'm 55 years old,</i>

01:00:18.366 --> 01:00:19.406
<i>and in 1999,</i>

01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:22.371
<i>I will die of cancer from the smoking.</i>

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:29.088
Hey. Are you going?

01:00:29.794 --> 01:00:31.004
Yeah.

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:35.756
Do me a favor.
Just take care of Abbie.

01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:42.013
<i>They don't know this is the end of punk.</i>

01:00:42.181 --> 01:00:44.021
<i>They don't know</i>
that Reagan's coming.

01:00:45.393 --> 01:00:46.983
<i>It's impossible to imagine</i>

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:50.231
<i>that kids will stop</i>
dreaming about nuclear war,

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:52.653
<i>and have nightmares about the weather.</i>

01:00:53.985 --> 01:00:57.235
<i>It's impossible to imagine HIV,</i>

01:00:57.905 --> 01:00:59.905
<i>what will happen</i>
with skateboard tricks,

01:01:01.159 --> 01:01:02.909
<i>the internet.</i>

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:04.701
You have a good time?

01:01:05.163 --> 01:01:06.963
Yeah, it was interesting.

01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:11.134
So Abbie has your number, right?

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:14.052
- Yeah.
- Maybe you'll come over for dinner.

01:01:14.756 --> 01:01:15.796
I'd like that.

01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:25.430
Kid.

01:01:28.561 --> 01:01:29.851
It's late.

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:32.939
How was it?

01:01:33.274 --> 01:01:37.154
It was... life-changing.

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:53.632
<i>Before I die, I will prepare for Y2K.</i>

01:01:54.337 --> 01:01:57.337
<i>I put canned food and water</i>
in the garage.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.300
<i>I put $16,000 dollars' worth of gold coins</i>

01:02:01.385 --> 01:02:05.215
<i>into a safe deposit box</i>
at the Bank of Montecito.

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:12.154
<i>I died before the new year,</i>

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:16.032
<i>Dolphin shaped balloons</i>
floated over my head.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.490
<i>They were playing Louis Armstrong</i>
on a boom box.

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:35.038
Jamie?

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.510
Hey, sorry. Are you awake?

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.090
I just wanted to tell you...

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:48.139
that you have to get out of this town
if you want to have any chance

01:02:48.224 --> 01:02:50.104
of an interesting life moving forward.

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:52.226
What happened?

01:02:54.897 --> 01:02:56.687
Sorry. Shit.

01:02:57.483 --> 01:02:59.073
We don't have sex.

01:03:00.236 --> 01:03:01.896
I just sleep here.

01:03:04.282 --> 01:03:05.782
Okay.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:08.450
Can I lay down?

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.790
- We were sleeping.
- Just scoot over.

01:03:10.872 --> 01:03:13.962
It's okay. I'm just gonna
talk to Jamie for a second.

01:03:16.669 --> 01:03:19.919
So Lynette Winters spit on me,

01:03:20.006 --> 01:03:21.046
<i>so then I hit her.</i>

01:03:21.591 --> 01:03:22.761
<i>Why'd she spit on you?</i>

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:24.302
<i>Because I spit on her,</i>

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:25.904
<i>right before</i>
I was going to New York

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:27.888
<i>and I thought I was never</i>
gonna come back.

01:03:28.139 --> 01:03:29.719
<i>It felt very liberating at the time.</i>

01:03:29.807 --> 01:03:31.137
- Fucking bitch!
- All right.

01:03:31.225 --> 01:03:33.385
<i>And somehow I ended up breaking a chair.</i>

01:03:36.022 --> 01:03:37.732
Hey, Julian, I'm sorry.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.190
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:43.910
<i>And then William told me</i>

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:45.868
<i>he didn't want</i>
to sleep with me anymore.

01:03:46.032 --> 01:03:48.532
What are you saying?
I don't like you!

01:03:48.618 --> 01:03:50.158
I don't like you! I don't like...

01:03:51.621 --> 01:03:54.121
Just, just, I'm just gonna
talk to Jamie for a second.

01:03:55.416 --> 01:03:59.546
Um, you cannot let her sleep here

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:02.417
if she's not having sex with you.

01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:05.008
It's disempowering.

01:04:05.885 --> 01:04:07.595
Also, you need to get out of this town

01:04:09.305 --> 01:04:12.305
before you start working
at a sunglasses shop.

01:04:15.353 --> 01:04:16.733
I mean, it goes for you, too.

01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:37.003
Jamie, um, here's some books
from a feminism class I took.

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:38.423
I thought it would be helpful

01:04:38.751 --> 01:04:40.381
for you to get a woman's perspective.

01:04:40.461 --> 01:04:41.671
What happened to your lip?

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:43.337
Oh, I got in a fight.

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:44.882
- You want some apples?
- What?!

01:04:44.966 --> 01:04:47.256
There was a fight.
It was... it was ridiculous.

01:04:47.343 --> 01:04:49.223
Hold on, is that
<i>Our Bodies, Ourselves?</i>

01:04:49.804 --> 01:04:50.854
Yes, it is.

01:04:51.013 --> 01:04:52.453
This was a really, really good book.

01:04:53.683 --> 01:04:58.403
There's a really good chapter
on home... childbirths.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:03.530
Home birth actually stunts
the baby's growth personality.

01:05:03.693 --> 01:05:06.113
What is a growth personality?

01:05:06.195 --> 01:05:07.235
It's a real term.

01:05:07.613 --> 01:05:10.163
"And who knows what it means
for a newborn

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:14.448
to see wood walls and carpeted floor

01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:17.117
and to smell real human smells

01:05:17.206 --> 01:05:20.576
and to feel wool
and cotton and flannel clothes

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:25.838
instead of starchy, white, deodorized"
dot, dot, dot.

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:27.925
To me, that meant, like,
"And what else?"

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:38.436
<i>Women's sexuality,</i>

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:40.769
<i>defined by men to benefit men,</i>

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:43.145
<i>has been downgraded and perverted,</i>

01:05:43.232 --> 01:05:44.822
<i>repressed and channeled.</i>

01:05:45.693 --> 01:05:48.863
<i>Anatomically, all orgasms</i>
are centered in the clitoris,

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:50.866
<i>whether they result</i>
from direct manual pressure

01:05:50.948 --> 01:05:52.118
<i>applied to the clitoris,</i>

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:54.293
<i>indirect pressure resulting from...</i>

01:05:54.368 --> 01:05:56.078
Last night, I fucked Heather so hard,

01:05:56.162 --> 01:05:57.542
she came like, three times.

01:05:59.165 --> 01:06:01.455
How did you stimulate her clitoris?

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.050
With my dick.

01:06:06.005 --> 01:06:09.045
Women need
direct clitoral stimulation,

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:12.803
like with fingers or a vibrator
or something.

01:06:13.804 --> 01:06:16.144
She probably faked it.
Women fake it all the time.

01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:19.104
Talking Heads are a bunch of fags.

01:06:21.228 --> 01:06:23.058
Actually, there's a girl in their band,

01:06:23.147 --> 01:06:25.897
and she's dating the drummer,
so...

01:06:28.152 --> 01:06:30.032
Your name's Jamie, right?

01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:33.659
Fuckin' art fag.

01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:45.292
So what was the fight about?

01:06:48.339 --> 01:06:50.549
Clitoral stimulation.

01:06:54.136 --> 01:06:55.966
Why do you need to fight about that?

01:06:57.139 --> 01:06:58.179
I don't know. I...

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:00.979
I wanna be a good guy, okay?

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.730
I just... want to be able
to satisfy a woman.

01:07:13.572 --> 01:07:15.952
Kid, I'm sure you will.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:32.585
Shit.

01:07:34.051 --> 01:07:35.721
Jamie!

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:37.758
That's not cool.

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:42.018
Yeah. That's what Matt called me
for liking the Talking Heads.

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:44.517
Uh-huh.

01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:48.112
And what is "Black Flag?"

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.402
It's a hard core band,

01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:55.324
so the people who love Black Flag
hate the Talking Heads.

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:57.735
What?!

01:07:57.825 --> 01:08:00.995
The punk scene is very divisive.

01:08:01.453 --> 01:08:06.173
Hey! You're all so advanced, aren't you?

01:08:07.376 --> 01:08:10.126
The next time a dude
tells you a sex story,

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:13.762
you just have to agree
with everything he says

01:08:13.841 --> 01:08:15.801
and act like it's right, even if it's not,

01:08:16.969 --> 01:08:18.969
because they don't
wanna be contradicted.

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:21.854
They just wanna live
in their fantasy lands.

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:27.185
How are you doing... with everything?

01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:45.495
Whatever you think your life
is going to be like,

01:08:45.581 --> 01:08:49.421
just know it's not gonna be
anything like that.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:54.377
Right.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:11.895
Take me to that club.

01:09:17.321 --> 01:09:18.411
Tonight?

01:09:19.948 --> 01:09:22.198
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:23.327 --> 01:09:25.197
Wow, you look amazing.
Where you going?

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:28.120
We're just gonna go out.
Is that okay?

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:30.080
Well yeah, of course.
And, uh, where?

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.287
Just goin' out.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.221
- Bye.
- Bye!

01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:56.859
Put that down.

01:09:57.695 --> 01:10:00.315
Hey, could I get a beer?

01:10:02.992 --> 01:10:06.162
Now say, "I... I'm into older women."

01:10:06.537 --> 01:10:08.367
Just say it.

01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:10.576
I'm into older women.

01:10:10.666 --> 01:10:11.706
Oh...

01:10:13.419 --> 01:10:14.459
How old are you?

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:17.172
Age is a bourgeois construct.

01:10:18.465 --> 01:10:20.755
Age is a bourgeois construct.

01:10:21.427 --> 01:10:22.887
That's a good answer.

01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:25.142
Age is a bourgeois construct.

01:10:25.431 --> 01:10:26.561
Okay, okay. You get it.

01:10:26.974 --> 01:10:29.984
Um, so now
if she asks you any questions,

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:33.020
you just say as little as possible, okay?

01:10:34.023 --> 01:10:36.483
Now show me
your most inscrutable face.

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:50.287
I don't really make choices, when they...

01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:52.039
about...

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.210
about women. They just...

01:10:55.377 --> 01:10:56.377
They come to you.

01:10:57.504 --> 01:11:00.424
That... that's...
You could have more than that.

01:11:03.427 --> 01:11:05.217
But what about you? Why...

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.770
I mean, what happened to Jamie's dad?

01:11:11.435 --> 01:11:14.265
Well...

01:11:15.522 --> 01:11:19.232
He just, no... He just didn't turn out like
I thought he would.

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:22.402
I guess that happens.

01:11:23.405 --> 01:11:25.525
There must have been
something good about him.

01:11:28.535 --> 01:11:31.655
Um, he was left-handed.

01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:35.501
That's it? That's it?

01:11:35.584 --> 01:11:37.804
Yes, and I was right-handed.

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:39.512
And so in the morning,

01:11:41.382 --> 01:11:43.512
we would look at
the stock reports together,

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:45.508
and...

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:48.791
he could write with his left-hand

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:51.517
and scratch my back
with his right.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:56.438
And that's it?

01:11:58.315 --> 01:11:59.475
I loved that.

01:12:04.279 --> 01:12:05.319
Do you ever meditate?

01:12:08.659 --> 01:12:09.699
Uh...

01:12:10.702 --> 01:12:11.752
I feel the air,

01:12:12.413 --> 01:12:14.253
coolness of the air
goes through my nose.

01:12:15.707 --> 01:12:17.787
All I'm really doing is...

01:12:19.420 --> 01:12:20.630
bringing my attention

01:12:21.922 --> 01:12:24.172
back to my breath.

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:26.841
So when I take a breath in...

01:12:27.803 --> 01:12:29.353
there's a feeling.

01:12:30.305 --> 01:12:32.055
It's air going in.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.350
It's air going out.

01:12:36.061 --> 01:12:37.441
It's a good feeling.

01:12:43.861 --> 01:12:46.071
No, it's okay. Go ahead.
I'm just gonna...

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:50.406
Go ahead.

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:52.794
I'm just gonna smoke.

01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:55.411
I'm listening.

01:12:57.291 --> 01:12:59.501
All right, I wanna get
on the same page.

01:13:00.461 --> 01:13:01.501
You are such...

01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:05.262
How did you get to be
this person that you are?

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:08.760
It's so... You're so unusual.

01:13:10.929 --> 01:13:12.309
<i>William's dad managed</i>

01:13:12.389 --> 01:13:14.019
<i>an auto repair shop in Cleveland.</i>

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:18.694
<i>Engines always made sense to him.</i>

01:13:19.730 --> 01:13:21.650
<i>He tried</i>
to put himself through college,

01:13:21.732 --> 01:13:23.612
<i>but couldn't afford it.</i>

01:13:27.529 --> 01:13:30.489
<i>He met Theresa in 1963.</i>

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:33.454
<i>She was smart, brave, better off.</i>

01:13:33.535 --> 01:13:34.575
<i>They were in love.</i>

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.250
<i>They'd move to Oakland,</i>

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:38.785
<i>then to a commune in Sebastopol.</i>

01:13:38.874 --> 01:13:41.004
Well, I learned to be like them, you know?

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.134
And... as it turns out,

01:13:43.754 --> 01:13:45.844
it's a lot easier
than I thought it would be.

01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:48.883
But it wasn't really me
I was doing it for...

01:13:50.344 --> 01:13:53.064
so that I wouldn't lose Theresa.

01:13:54.306 --> 01:13:55.806
<i>He started talking like them,</i>

01:13:55.891 --> 01:13:56.931
<i>looking like them,</i>

01:13:57.434 --> 01:14:01.064
<i>but they made him feel old</i>
and uneducated and poor.

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:03.270
<i>Theresa started thinking</i>

01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:05.857
<i>William was uptight and possessive</i>
and she left him.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:08.357
<i>After Theresa,</i>

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:10.445
<i>women didn't have to look</i>
one way or the other,

01:14:10.531 --> 01:14:11.571
<i>or be a certain way.</i>

01:14:16.328 --> 01:14:17.368
<i>I think that I just...</i>

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:19.672
<i>I want to win them over</i>

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:21.627
<i>so that I won't be lonely.</i>

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:23.751
You live here?

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:25.459
I do.

01:14:25.587 --> 01:14:27.087
<i>But once I have them,</i>

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:30.011
<i>I don't really know</i>
what to do with them.

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:39.771
You wanna do something later?

01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:42.651
You're sweet.

01:14:43.605 --> 01:14:45.145
I should go.

01:14:46.608 --> 01:14:49.148
<i>What he likes is making bowls.</i>

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:51.360
<i>He doesn't smell like oil and grease.</i>

01:14:51.446 --> 01:14:53.776
<i>His hands don't look like</i>
dumb mechanic's hands.

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:56.289
<i>I was using the smaller bowls for a while.</i>

01:14:56.368 --> 01:14:58.538
<i>Um, and then I was kind of feeling</i>
like I needed

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:00.750
<i>to beat the crap</i>
out of some stuff, so...

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:05.460
And when it gets a little bit drier,

01:15:05.544 --> 01:15:07.424
you spray everything away.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.550
Wow.

01:15:10.257 --> 01:15:11.297
It's beautiful.

01:15:17.514 --> 01:15:18.684
What?

01:15:21.393 --> 01:15:22.443
Did you fix it?

01:15:22.769 --> 01:15:23.809
Um...

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:24.935
Well, maybe...

01:15:25.522 --> 01:15:29.442
It's, uh, part Vol... Volkswagen now.
I had to imp... improvise.

01:15:56.887 --> 01:15:59.507
And how are you gonna get to know
a person way over there?

01:16:01.016 --> 01:16:03.186
What am...
What am I supposed to do?

01:16:04.061 --> 01:16:06.651
Well, just make a little small talk

01:16:06.813 --> 01:16:09.863
and introduce yourself, ask her to dance.

01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:13.111
Okay. Hello, I'm William.

01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:14.912
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:17.409
- Um, I live downstairs.
- Oh, yeah.

01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:18.869
I'm the one with the cars.

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:21.503
Would you like to dance with me?

01:16:22.287 --> 01:16:24.957
- Yes. Sure.
- Okay.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:26.210
Put your hand out, right?

01:16:27.084 --> 01:16:28.214
Put the other hand here.

01:16:28.794 --> 01:16:30.634
And just be there.

01:16:31.672 --> 01:16:33.382
She just wants a little company.

01:16:34.383 --> 01:16:35.803
Oh.

01:16:36.802 --> 01:16:38.142
Okay.

01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:42.272
That's nice.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:17.880
I... I feel like I... I understand you.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:21.050
We should get away from here.

01:17:21.638 --> 01:17:23.138
Just... just me and you, you know?

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:26.597
Go up the coast, be alone somewhere.

01:17:28.353 --> 01:17:30.653
Jamie, you're in love with Julie.

01:17:35.777 --> 01:17:37.397
You can't let her push you around.

01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:40.533
You have to tell her what you want.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:53.207
...if you, if you were to listen to it...

01:17:53.295 --> 01:17:54.295
Right.

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:56.511
What does... what does that mean?

01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:58.430
"Art Fag?" I mean what does...

01:17:58.508 --> 01:18:03.258
If you were to think about it
from more like a sociological perspective,

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:05.596
what does that come from? "Art Fag."

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:06.743
- I think we...
- What is that?

01:18:06.767 --> 01:18:09.307
- Abbie understands it.
- Abbie does not understand it.

01:18:09.686 --> 01:18:11.726
She's just a part of it.

01:18:26.703 --> 01:18:28.623
You don't need to like it.

01:18:29.206 --> 01:18:30.866
Okay, what is he saying?

01:18:33.418 --> 01:18:35.498
"Head on my shoulders..."

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:38.879
"Going berserk..."

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.840
Right.

01:18:41.009 --> 01:18:42.049
Is that interesting?

01:18:42.427 --> 01:18:43.467
I don't know.

01:18:43.887 --> 01:18:44.927
I don't know either.

01:18:45.764 --> 01:18:47.724
I think we're maybe over-thinking this.

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:05.775
Let's try the Art Fag one.

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:10.331
Here come the Art Fags.

01:19:14.376 --> 01:19:15.376
Oh, yeah.

01:19:33.061 --> 01:19:34.561
All right, you ready?

01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:38.532
That's it.

01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:43.782
I guess we're more the Art Fag type.

01:19:44.739 --> 01:19:45.739
Uh-huh.

01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:47.284
I like that.

<i>I gave him beer,</i>

01:20:33.455 --> 01:20:38.205
<i>and then I... I taught him</i>
how to verbally seduce women,

01:20:38.293 --> 01:20:42.013
<i>and we drove drunk,</i>
but I stopped that,

01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.550
and then he kissed Trish.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:47.510
And then we walked home.

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:51.176
Ah.

01:20:57.270 --> 01:20:58.940
You're not mad?

01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:01.398
You're mad.

01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:12.116
You get to see him out in the world
as a person.

01:21:13.036 --> 01:21:14.826
I never will.

01:21:22.379 --> 01:21:23.669
Just...

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:33.135
There.

01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:07.470
<i>I can't believe Abbie gave you this book.</i>

01:22:09.384 --> 01:22:10.724
<i>It's interesting.</i>

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:16.636
What's it like... for girls?

01:22:16.808 --> 01:22:19.728
What? Sex?

01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:23.515
Orgasms.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.150
Do you really want to know
what it's like?

01:22:32.282 --> 01:22:33.622
Yeah.

01:22:35.076 --> 01:22:36.656
I don't have them.

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:40.121
What?

01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:43.042
None of my friends do.

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:47.462
Then why do you do it?

01:22:48.089 --> 01:22:49.219
There's other reasons.

01:22:50.592 --> 01:22:53.052
You know, like the way
that he looks at you...

01:22:56.473 --> 01:22:59.273
or the way they get a little
bit desperate at some point.

01:23:00.852 --> 01:23:03.732
And the little sounds that they make.

01:23:17.243 --> 01:23:19.203
And their bodies...

01:23:21.247 --> 01:23:24.327
'cause you don't exactly know
what they're gonna look like...

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.460
<i>or smell or feel like...</i>

01:23:30.673 --> 01:23:31.933
<i>until you do it.</i>

01:23:36.137 --> 01:23:39.057
<i>But, yeah...</i>
half the time I regret it.

01:23:42.852 --> 01:23:44.812
Then why do you do it?

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:49.070
'Cause half the time, I don't regret it.

01:24:00.787 --> 01:24:02.407
<i>"I am gregarious.</i>

01:24:02.497 --> 01:24:03.537
<i>Interested in others.</i>

01:24:04.123 --> 01:24:05.293
<i>And I think, intelligent.</i>

01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.470
<i>All I ask is to get to know people</i>

01:24:12.549 --> 01:24:14.549
<i>and to have them interested</i>
in knowing me.

01:24:15.176 --> 01:24:16.846
<i>I doubt whether I would marry again</i>

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:19.846
<i>and live that close</i>
to another individual,

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.271
<i>but I remain invisible.</i>

01:24:23.226 --> 01:24:25.266
<i>Don't pretend for a minute</i>
as you look at me,

01:24:26.187 --> 01:24:28.187
<i>that I am not as alive as you are,</i>

01:24:28.898 --> 01:24:31.898
<i>and I do not suffer from the category</i>
to which you are forcing me.

01:24:36.155 --> 01:24:38.365
<i>I think, stripped down,</i>
I look more attractive

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.620
<i>than my ex-husband...</i>

01:24:41.619 --> 01:24:45.869
<i>...but I am sexually and socially obsolete</i>
and he is not.

01:24:47.208 --> 01:24:49.588
I have a capacity now for
taking people as they are,

01:24:49.836 --> 01:24:50.876
which I lacked at 20.

01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:56.051
I reach orgasm in half the time
and I know how to please,

01:24:56.134 --> 01:25:00.014
yet I do not even dare show a man
that I find him attractive.

01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:03.980
If I do, he may react
as if I have insulted him.

01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:09.900
I'm supposed to fulfill my small functions
and vanish."

01:25:16.279 --> 01:25:17.319
Well...

01:25:18.239 --> 01:25:19.869
What do you think of all that?

01:25:23.411 --> 01:25:26.211
I don't know. Maybe I'm a feminist.

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:33.170
So...

01:25:38.343 --> 01:25:40.303
You think that's me.

01:25:41.054 --> 01:25:42.684
No, I don't know.

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:46.682
So you think you know me better
because you read that?

01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:48.476
No, no.

01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:54.319
Then why are you reading it to me?

01:25:57.153 --> 01:26:00.283
Um, I thought it was interesting.

01:26:06.245 --> 01:26:08.035
Okay, well...

01:26:10.708 --> 01:26:13.878
I... I don't need a book
to know about myself.

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:23.264
Sorry.

01:26:39.737 --> 01:26:42.197
<i>I mean, I appreciate you trying to help.</i>

01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:45.451
<i>I do. I just think</i>
you're taking it too far.

01:26:45.702 --> 01:26:46.742
This stuff with,

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:50.117
you know, the women's movement
I respect,

01:26:50.206 --> 01:26:52.576
but it's just, it's complicated

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:54.587
and I think it's too much for him.

01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:57.109
What are... I don't know what
it is that you're talking about.

01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:59.801
- Okay. He's a 15-year-old boy.
- I know.

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:02.262
You're giving him hard core
feminism, and it-it...

01:27:02.927 --> 01:27:04.607
But he really loves it, and it's really...

01:27:04.679 --> 01:27:06.559
- It's helping him...
- Helping him what?

01:27:07.306 --> 01:27:08.617
It's helping him
become a man, th...

01:27:08.641 --> 01:27:10.121
What you were talking about. It's like...

01:27:10.143 --> 01:27:12.693
Learning about a female orgasm
is helping him be a man?

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:15.435
Well, what man do you know
that cares anything about that?

01:27:15.523 --> 01:27:17.233
- Look, he's...
- I mean that's a miracle.

01:27:17.316 --> 01:27:18.856
But he is a high school kid, okay?

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:22.238
It's too much. I'm telling you.

01:27:25.324 --> 01:27:27.584
I think he seems really okay with it.

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.960
You know you don't actually know
what you're doing with him?

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:38.762
Okay? So... just...

01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:43.297
<i>As you know,</i>

01:27:43.384 --> 01:27:47.564
<i>there is a growing</i>
disrespect for government,

01:27:47.638 --> 01:27:49.968
<i>for schools, the news media</i>

01:27:50.141 --> 01:27:51.271
<i>and other institutions.</i>

01:27:52.518 --> 01:27:56.728
<i>This is not a message</i>
of happiness or reassurance.

01:27:57.315 --> 01:27:59.275
<i>But it is the truth</i>

01:27:59.567 --> 01:28:01.397
<i>and it is a warning.</i>

01:28:02.737 --> 01:28:04.277
It is a crisis... of confidence.

01:28:08.284 --> 01:28:09.334
<i>We can see this crisis</i>

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:12.826
<i>in the growing doubt</i>
about the meaning of our own lives

01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:15.116
<i>and in the loss of a unity of purpose</i>

01:28:16.459 --> 01:28:18.089
<i>for our nation.</i>

01:28:19.629 --> 01:28:20.669
<i>Too many of us now</i>

01:28:21.798 --> 01:28:26.588
<i>tend to worship self-indulgence</i>
and consumption.

01:28:27.386 --> 01:28:28.426
<i>But we've discovered</i>

01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:31.560
<i>that owning things</i>
and consuming things...

01:28:34.185 --> 01:28:35.225
<i>does not satisfy</i>

01:28:36.395 --> 01:28:39.265
<i>our longing for meaning.</i>

01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:42.899
<i>We always believed...</i>

01:28:43.945 --> 01:28:46.775
<i>that we were part</i>
of a great movement

01:28:46.864 --> 01:28:47.914
<i>of humanity itself...</i>

01:28:49.325 --> 01:28:52.365
<i>involved in a search for freedom.</i>

01:28:57.416 --> 01:29:00.876
<i>We are at a turning point</i>
in our history.

01:29:03.339 --> 01:29:07.469
<i>The path that leads to fragmentation</i>
and self-interest.

01:29:08.803 --> 01:29:12.683
<i>Down that road lies</i>
a mistaken idea of freedom.

01:29:14.642 --> 01:29:18.312
<i>It is a certain route to failure.</i>

01:29:20.898 --> 01:29:22.978
<i>Thank you and good night.</i>

01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:27.491
Wow. He is so screwed.

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:29.414
No shit.

01:29:29.866 --> 01:29:31.446
It's over for him.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.000
I thought that was beautiful.

01:29:36.455 --> 01:29:40.705
Well, why didn't you just say,
"I'm sorry, I'm done?"

01:29:41.085 --> 01:29:42.125
My pride.

01:29:42.503 --> 01:29:43.673
- I know.
- Yeah, it's...

01:29:43.796 --> 01:29:46.416
You didn't seem like a prideful person.
You seem humble.

01:29:46.507 --> 01:29:50.047
I left my pride outside today.

01:29:51.137 --> 01:29:53.307
Jamie, would you please wake up Abbie?

01:29:55.516 --> 01:29:58.766
- Yeah. Abbie?
- No, stop it. I'm menstruating.

01:30:00.354 --> 01:30:01.404
Abbie, you know what?

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:04.649
You're menstruating. Okay.
But do you have to say it?

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:09.030
Okay? And do we really need to know
everything that's going on with you?

01:30:09.447 --> 01:30:11.697
What? I'm menstruating.

01:30:12.325 --> 01:30:13.365
Why is that a big deal?

01:30:13.576 --> 01:30:16.246
We don't need to hear about that.
Thank you.

01:30:17.413 --> 01:30:20.003
If you ever want to have
an adult relationship with a woman,

01:30:20.082 --> 01:30:22.422
like if you want to have sex
with a woman's vagina,

01:30:22.627 --> 01:30:23.837
you need to be comfortable

01:30:24.253 --> 01:30:27.303
with the fact
that the vagina menstruates,

01:30:27.381 --> 01:30:29.551
and just say menstruation.
It's not a big deal.

01:30:29.634 --> 01:30:33.354
So start saying it now.
Menstruation.

01:30:34.388 --> 01:30:37.268
- Now?
- Yes. Menstruation.

01:30:37.975 --> 01:30:39.015
Menstruation.

01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:41.270
Jamie, no, you don't have to.

01:30:41.729 --> 01:30:43.040
You're saying it like you're scared.

01:30:43.064 --> 01:30:44.254
- Don't say it like you're scared.
- Abbie.

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:46.283
- Say it like it's normal.
- Menstruation.

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:48.105
- Menstruation.
- Menstruation.

01:30:48.194 --> 01:30:52.114
Not bad. Julian, menstruation.
You can say it. Right now.

01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:55.830
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, men... menstruation.

01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.910
Just keep eye contact with me.
What... Who are you looking at?

01:30:58.996 --> 01:31:01.206
- Menstruation.
- Menstruation.

01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:03.000
Yeah, that's right. Menstruation.

01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:05.997
Charlie, you're quiet. Menstruation?

01:31:06.087 --> 01:31:07.297
Menstruation?

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.670
No, not like a question. Menstruation.

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:13.009
- Menstruation.
- Now everybody say it together.

01:31:13.594 --> 01:31:15.224
Menstruation.

01:31:15.346 --> 01:31:18.596
Like gentle, happy, but casual.
And...

01:31:18.975 --> 01:31:20.015
Menstruation.

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:21.558
It's gross, Abbie.

01:31:21.769 --> 01:31:25.769
No, it's... it's not gross.
It's a very deep time creatively,

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:28.400
and it's emotionally transformative.

01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:30.650
And sex during menstruation

01:31:31.362 --> 01:31:33.072
can be very pleasurable for a woman.

01:31:33.239 --> 01:31:36.329
It can even, like,
relieve some of the cramps.

01:31:36.409 --> 01:31:39.579
Jamie, I also wanna say never
have sex with just the vagina.

01:31:39.662 --> 01:31:41.302
You have to have sex
with the whole woman.

01:31:42.957 --> 01:31:44.997
That's slightly off topic
of what I'm talking about.

01:31:45.042 --> 01:31:46.092
You too? You too, William?

01:31:46.168 --> 01:31:47.998
- I mean... Thank you.
- But that's okay.

01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:50.511
The first time that I got my period,

01:31:50.756 --> 01:31:51.796
I was watching

01:31:52.675 --> 01:31:54.135
<i>One That Flew</i>
Over the Cuckoo's Nest

01:31:54.218 --> 01:31:55.258
with some guy.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.140
And, um...

01:31:57.638 --> 01:31:59.518
Yeah, I just told him
that I had to leave,

01:32:00.224 --> 01:32:03.604
so I went to the market
and I bought a box of tampons,

01:32:03.686 --> 01:32:06.306
and I read the instructions
on the box and I put one in...

01:32:06.522 --> 01:32:08.212
- Julie?
- and I never told my mom about it,

01:32:08.232 --> 01:32:10.532
but she never asked, so it didn't matter.

01:32:11.694 --> 01:32:14.534
And I never saw the end
of the <i>Cuckoo's Nest.</i>

01:32:17.033 --> 01:32:20.293
Jack Nicholson got a lobotomy,
and so the big Indian guy

01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:22.576
smothered him with a pillow
so that he could,

01:32:22.663 --> 01:32:23.793
you know, be free and...

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:25.520
Okay, let's talk about
something else.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.170
- Would you mind?
- When I was 14,

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:28.591
I had sex for the first time.

01:32:28.753 --> 01:32:29.803
Julie!

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:31.380
Julie, please. You... Honey...

01:32:32.048 --> 01:32:34.838
I decided one night
that I was just gonna lose my virginity.

01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:36.261
I didn't care who it was to.

01:32:36.552 --> 01:32:39.012
- Julie, you gotta calm down.
- Stop it. Let her talk.

01:32:39.263 --> 01:32:41.563
I picked this guy that
I didn't know at a party...

01:32:42.308 --> 01:32:46.438
and we had fairly painful sex in his van.

01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:48.060
It was just parked on the street.

01:32:48.773 --> 01:32:50.443
He just used spit for lubrication.

01:32:53.694 --> 01:32:55.654
I made it home on time
for curfew, though.

01:32:55.821 --> 01:32:58.571
His carpet smelled
like spilled bong water.

01:33:04.246 --> 01:33:05.406
Okay, um...

01:33:06.499 --> 01:33:08.539
let's call it a night. All right?

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:10.707
Thanks all for coming.
Show's over, girls.

01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:14.048
Thank you so much for coming.

01:33:16.592 --> 01:33:18.262
Jamie, we need to talk.

01:33:19.011 --> 01:33:20.971
There's a lot of stuff happening, right?

01:33:21.639 --> 01:33:25.429
And I just would like to know
what's going on with you.

01:33:26.352 --> 01:33:28.902
I mean, I know this has all been
a lot for us to deal with.

01:33:30.648 --> 01:33:33.318
Mom, I'm dealing
with everything right now.

01:33:33.901 --> 01:33:36.281
You are dealing with nothing.

01:33:49.708 --> 01:33:51.838
I can't believe you told
everyone all that.

01:33:52.962 --> 01:33:54.962
I can say what I want to say.

01:33:57.174 --> 01:33:58.844
They're gonna think you're some...

01:33:59.802 --> 01:34:01.722
They're gonna get
the wrong idea about you.

01:34:01.804 --> 01:34:02.854
What?

01:34:03.389 --> 01:34:04.929
That I'm a slut?

01:34:07.518 --> 01:34:08.888
Is that what you think?

01:34:13.232 --> 01:34:15.402
You can't sleep here anymore...

01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:17.988
and just want to talk.

01:34:22.032 --> 01:34:23.452
Really?

01:34:26.162 --> 01:34:27.582
Yeah.

01:34:31.125 --> 01:34:32.745
Jamie.

01:34:37.965 --> 01:34:39.465
I'm sorry.

01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:46.181
I am sorry, okay?

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:53.649
Let's... let's just get out of here.

01:34:55.107 --> 01:34:58.737
Let's go up the coast like...
like you said that we would.

01:35:00.905 --> 01:35:01.945
Just the two of us.

01:35:10.789 --> 01:35:11.959
<i>Mom...</i>

01:35:12.917 --> 01:35:14.707
<i>Julie and I took the car.</i>

01:35:16.837 --> 01:35:18.587
<i>We're taking a trip up the coast...</i>

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.590
<i>just to get away.</i>

01:35:22.551 --> 01:35:24.091
<i>You don't need to worry about us.</i>

01:36:22.528 --> 01:36:24.358
Hey, do you think
that you could, um...

01:36:25.656 --> 01:36:27.366
buy us some, like, wine coolers?

01:36:27.992 --> 01:36:29.122
You can keep the change.

01:36:30.119 --> 01:36:32.869
Strawberry or anything berry, really.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:43.880
Hi. What's the matter?

01:36:44.258 --> 01:36:45.298
Hi.

01:36:45.593 --> 01:36:47.973
You changed lanes
in the intersection back there.

01:36:48.679 --> 01:36:50.219
Seriously? That's all?

01:36:51.223 --> 01:36:53.353
I need to see your license
and registration.

01:36:54.351 --> 01:36:57.021
Well, what if I don't have my license?

01:36:58.647 --> 01:37:00.750
Okay, well what's your name,
address and date of birth?

01:37:00.774 --> 01:37:01.824
Do you have that?

01:37:01.984 --> 01:37:04.154
You know,
those are very personal questions,

01:37:04.528 --> 01:37:05.568
and we've just met.

01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:09.368
What's your name?
What's your address, right?

01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:11.410
I mean, it's a little forward.

01:37:38.937 --> 01:37:41.397
I, uh, I love you.

01:37:49.406 --> 01:37:50.946
What's wrong?

01:37:51.867 --> 01:37:52.987
Nothing.

01:37:58.082 --> 01:37:59.172
Tell me.

01:38:05.047 --> 01:38:07.757
I think that I'm too close to you...

01:38:08.967 --> 01:38:10.677
to have sex with you.

01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:15.020
I know it's confusing.

01:38:17.059 --> 01:38:18.269
I'm sorry.

01:38:23.023 --> 01:38:24.363
I can...

01:38:25.150 --> 01:38:26.650
I can help you get over that.

01:38:29.905 --> 01:38:32.025
I don't want to get over that.

01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:36.040
Yes, you do.

01:38:37.871 --> 01:38:39.501
You're being like the other guys.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:42.250
I don't wanna just have sex with you.

01:38:43.252 --> 01:38:44.382
I want you.

01:38:45.087 --> 01:38:47.087
But it's your version of me.

01:38:49.216 --> 01:38:50.626
It's not me.

01:38:52.845 --> 01:38:55.005
It would be a lot better
if you just wanted sex.

01:38:56.140 --> 01:38:57.850
You are exactly like the other guys.

01:38:59.017 --> 01:39:01.477
You just seem like you're all modern.

01:39:14.408 --> 01:39:16.028
Jamie.

01:39:17.619 --> 01:39:19.079
Jamie.

01:39:19.913 --> 01:39:20.963
Jamie!

01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:54.990
These people have no sense of humor.

01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:15.760
Having a kid seems like...

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:18.965
the hardest thing.

01:40:20.682 --> 01:40:22.022
Yeah.

01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:25.480
How much you love the kid...

01:40:29.942 --> 01:40:32.492
You're just pretty much screwed.

01:40:44.748 --> 01:40:46.748
- Well, it's good for you.
- Hi. Uh...

01:40:46.834 --> 01:40:47.964
Hey.

01:40:48.877 --> 01:40:50.997
Julie just called me.
They're in San Louis Obispo.

01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:52.418
She doesn't know where he is.

01:40:52.673 --> 01:40:54.053
She can't find him.

01:40:55.217 --> 01:40:57.047
- I... Would you drive me...
- Yes, I will.

01:40:57.302 --> 01:40:58.762
- ...up there?
- Yep. Let's go.

01:40:58.929 --> 01:41:00.599
- Will you come?
- Yes.

01:41:45.142 --> 01:41:46.772
I'm sorry.

01:41:51.607 --> 01:41:53.187
He came back.

01:41:54.318 --> 01:41:55.988
He's right there.

01:41:57.863 --> 01:42:00.243
Okay. Okay.

01:42:04.286 --> 01:42:05.696
It's okay.

01:42:28.477 --> 01:42:29.727
Well...

01:42:30.228 --> 01:42:32.018
Julie's a pretty complicated woman.

01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:34.780
It's a lot to take on,

01:42:35.108 --> 01:42:37.028
but I'm impressed in a way.

01:42:39.237 --> 01:42:40.317
Whatever.

01:42:50.707 --> 01:42:52.077
Aren't you gonna get Julie...

01:42:52.876 --> 01:42:53.996
to come talk with me?

01:42:54.586 --> 01:42:56.086
Jamie!

01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:57.304
What?

01:42:57.756 --> 01:42:59.336
I... I thought they'd help.

01:43:00.801 --> 01:43:04.301
Well, it just seemed like you
couldn't deal with me anymore.

01:43:06.556 --> 01:43:07.926
Look.

01:43:08.725 --> 01:43:12.475
I wanted... I...
I...

01:43:13.313 --> 01:43:14.693
Look, I...

01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:19.239
I don't want you to end up
in the same place as me.

01:43:21.905 --> 01:43:23.365
What does that mean?

01:43:24.408 --> 01:43:26.738
Well, I wanted you to be happier.

01:43:28.912 --> 01:43:32.922
And I just didn't think
I could do it by myself. I...

01:43:36.378 --> 01:43:37.588
Okay.

01:43:39.631 --> 01:43:41.841
I thought we were fine, though,
just me and you.

01:43:48.974 --> 01:43:50.354
Yeah?

01:43:52.728 --> 01:43:54.098
Yeah.

01:44:27.304 --> 01:44:29.104
Okay. Come on.

01:44:29.222 --> 01:44:30.602
Come on. Dance with your mom.

01:45:29.825 --> 01:45:30.865
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:45:31.493 --> 01:45:32.623
Bye.

01:45:34.496 --> 01:45:35.536
- Be safe.
- Bye.

01:45:35.789 --> 01:45:37.499
Bye. Bye.

01:45:47.175 --> 01:45:49.505
So maybe we don't go back yet.

01:45:52.472 --> 01:45:53.522
Okay.

01:46:03.859 --> 01:46:05.939
Were you and Dad ever in love?

01:46:06.611 --> 01:46:08.031
Sure.

01:46:13.535 --> 01:46:15.115
Or, um...

01:46:16.413 --> 01:46:17.463
Maybe I was just...

01:46:19.791 --> 01:46:21.961
I felt I was supposed to be in love.

01:46:23.044 --> 01:46:25.964
Or I was...

01:46:26.172 --> 01:46:28.842
I was scared I'd never be in love...

01:46:30.927 --> 01:46:32.967
so I... I...

01:46:34.556 --> 01:46:37.386
I just picked
the best solution at the time.

01:46:48.361 --> 01:46:49.991
I wanna bleach my hair.

01:46:50.572 --> 01:46:53.532
Kid... really?

01:46:54.451 --> 01:46:55.871
Yeah.

01:47:04.419 --> 01:47:05.799
Okay.

01:47:10.967 --> 01:47:12.467
Are you lonely?

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:14.760
Well...

01:47:15.555 --> 01:47:18.635
I might marry Bogart in my next life.

01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.140
We'll see.

01:47:20.352 --> 01:47:21.392
I'm thinking about it.

01:47:22.604 --> 01:47:24.524
Uh, he's dead.

01:47:25.774 --> 01:47:27.284
Well...

01:47:27.901 --> 01:47:29.191
This is my next life, right?

01:47:30.195 --> 01:47:31.605
So...

01:47:32.656 --> 01:47:33.696
he may be there.

01:47:33.782 --> 01:47:36.992
He may be around
and we might meet and...

01:47:38.328 --> 01:47:40.828
something might happen between us.

01:47:42.415 --> 01:47:44.575
Okay, um...

01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.300
you can't have it in the real world?

01:47:47.921 --> 01:47:50.051
Hey. This is no time
to be rational, sweetie.

01:47:50.924 --> 01:47:52.094
Can you just go with this?

01:47:53.551 --> 01:47:54.591
Yeah. Keep going.

01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:56.600
Okay.

01:47:57.514 --> 01:47:59.144
So he... he knows what I'm thinking,

01:48:01.017 --> 01:48:03.017
and he makes me laugh...

01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:06.689
and he really sees me...

01:48:08.024 --> 01:48:11.864
and you know that he's gonna
do what he says he's gonna do,

01:48:11.945 --> 01:48:14.485
so that's easy.

01:48:15.448 --> 01:48:17.278
He sounds nice.

01:48:18.576 --> 01:48:19.616
Yeah.

01:48:27.335 --> 01:48:28.562
<i>I thought that was just the beginning</i>

01:48:28.586 --> 01:48:30.206
<i>of a new relationship with her...</i>

01:48:32.215 --> 01:48:34.425
<i>where she'd really tell me stuff...</i>

01:48:36.803 --> 01:48:39.563
<i>but maybe it was</i>
never really like that again.

01:48:41.307 --> 01:48:42.977
<i>Maybe that was it.</i>

01:48:44.728 --> 01:48:46.598
<i>In March of 1999,</i>

01:48:47.188 --> 01:48:49.478
<i>I'll start to feel tired and confused.</i>

01:48:50.608 --> 01:48:52.108
<i>When I finally go to the doctor,</i>

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.150
<i>he will say that the cancer</i>
in my lungs

01:48:54.946 --> 01:48:58.826
<i>had already traveled</i>
to my breast and brain.

01:48:59.492 --> 01:49:02.372
<i>I'll try to teach Jamie</i>
what to do with my stocks,

01:49:02.454 --> 01:49:06.174
<i>but my instructions will be</i>
impossible to understand.

01:49:11.963 --> 01:49:13.633
See you later.

01:49:20.055 --> 01:49:23.095
<i>Abbie will take me</i>
to Planned Parenthood...

01:49:23.892 --> 01:49:25.812
<i>and I will go on the pill.</i>

01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:31.824
<i>I will go to NYU</i>

01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:33.900
<i>and lose touch with Jamie</i>
and Dorothea...

01:49:35.737 --> 01:49:38.107
<i>and I will stop talking to my mom.</i>

01:49:39.657 --> 01:49:41.367
<i>I will fall in love with Nicholas...</i>

01:49:42.577 --> 01:49:44.497
<i>and we'll move to Paris...</i>

01:49:45.622 --> 01:49:47.332
<i>and choose not to have children.</i>

01:49:49.626 --> 01:49:51.956
<i>I will stay in Santa Barbara.</i>

01:49:52.462 --> 01:49:54.132
<i>In just two years,</i>
I'll marry Dave.

01:49:56.091 --> 01:49:57.381
<i>A month after I get married,</i>

01:49:58.468 --> 01:50:00.388
<i>Carlotta will die.</i>

01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:06.390
<i>A week later, Max will die, too.</i>

01:50:07.894 --> 01:50:09.564
<i>I will work out of my garage</i>

01:50:09.646 --> 01:50:12.516
<i>and show in local galleries.</i>

01:50:13.733 --> 01:50:15.073
<i>Against my doctor's advice,</i>

01:50:15.568 --> 01:50:16.608
<i>I will get pregnant.</i>

01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:18.610
<i>By the time I'm 34,</i>

01:50:19.405 --> 01:50:20.445
<i>I'll have two boys.</i>

01:50:25.286 --> 01:50:27.826
<i>I'll live with</i>
Dorothea for another year...

01:50:30.166 --> 01:50:34.626
<i>and then I'll open a pottery store</i>
in Sedona, Arizona.

01:50:37.590 --> 01:50:39.590
<i>I'll marry Laurie, a singer-songwriter.</i>

01:50:40.593 --> 01:50:42.353
<i>We'll get divorced in a year.</i>

01:50:43.138 --> 01:50:44.258
<i>Then I'll meet Sandy...</i>

01:50:45.557 --> 01:50:47.177
<i>and continue to do my pottery.</i>

01:50:50.395 --> 01:50:52.685
<i>My mom will meet Jim in 1983.</i>

01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:56.030
<i>They will stay a couple</i>
until she dies.

01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:58.820
<i>On her birthday each year,</i>

01:50:59.737 --> 01:51:02.657
<i>he will buy her a trip on a biplane.</i>

01:51:05.285 --> 01:51:07.655
<i>Years after she's gone,</i>
I will finally get married

01:51:07.745 --> 01:51:09.575
<i>and have a son.</i>

01:51:11.374 --> 01:51:12.584
<i>I will try to explain to him</i>

01:51:12.959 --> 01:51:15.129
<i>what his grandmother was like...</i>

01:51:16.629 --> 01:51:18.009
