WEBVTT

00:01.490 --> 00:04.200
PASTOR WEEKS: MY BELOVED
CRENSHAW COMMUNITY,

00:04.200 --> 00:06.200
WE'RE IN A CRISIS.

00:06.200 --> 00:11.870
THIS PAST WEEK, WE LOST ANOTHER
BLACK MAN TO THE STREETS.

00:11.870 --> 00:15.710
AND NOW AS A COMMUNITY,
WE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE.

00:15.710 --> 00:22.720
IS THIS DEATH GOING TO BRING US
TOGETHER OR TEAR US APART?

00:22.720 --> 00:27.720
I REMEMBER AS A YOUNG BOY
IN SUNDAY SCHOOL,

00:27.720 --> 00:31.730
TYRONE AND HIS SISTER MONIQUE
USED TO TALK NONSTOP

00:31.730 --> 00:34.400
ABOUT THEIR HOPES AND DREAMS--

00:34.400 --> 00:38.400
MORE DREAMS THAN REALITY
COULD DEFY.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.070
HE WAS ONCE A SON OF THIS
COMMUNITY, Y'ALL.

00:42.070 --> 00:46.910
SO IT'S OK TO MOURN THE LOSS OF
THIS YOUNG LIFE,

00:46.910 --> 00:51.410
IT'S OK TO MOURN THE LOSS OF
THOSE HOPES AND DREAMS...

00:51.410 --> 00:56.080
SPENCER, IF YOU DON'T
TURN YOUR HEAD AND
FACE THE PASTOR.

00:56.080 --> 00:58.630
SHAWN'S MOM'S HERE.

00:58.630 --> 01:02.090
WHEN SHE GET BACK
FROM LOUISIANA?

01:02.090 --> 01:04.970
GRACE: MY GUESS IS
SHE'S HERE
TO MAKE PEACE

01:04.970 --> 01:07.100
WITH THE MAN WHO HAD
HER SON KILLED.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.930
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT
I'D BE TRYING TO DO.

01:09.930 --> 01:14.940
WEEKS: BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS
DARK MOMENT TO DEFINE US.

01:14.940 --> 01:19.110
NOW IS THE TIME TO JOIN ARMS
AND HOLD EACH OTHER DOWN

01:19.110 --> 01:21.610
AS A COMMUNITY.

01:21.610 --> 01:25.450
LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBOR AND TELL
HIM, "I GOT YOU."

01:25.450 --> 01:26.780
CHURCHGOERS: I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU...

01:26.780 --> 01:29.450
BOTH: I GOT YOU.

02:18.330 --> 02:21.500
YOU BEEN A HARD PERSON
TO REACH THIS PAST WEEK.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.380
OH, MAN. MY PARENTS
GOT ME SO LOCKED DOWN,

02:23.380 --> 02:25.840
THEY MAKING PELICAN BAY
LOOK LIKE A DAMN DAY CARE.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.880
LOOK, YOU ARE A SUSPECT
IN TYRONE'S MURDER.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.680
-A PERSON OF INTEREST.
-WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

02:29.680 --> 02:31.720
I WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIM.
THERE AIN'T NO DENYING THAT.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.890
AND I'M STILL HERE
DROPPING THE SAME DATES
TYRONE GOT SHOT.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.850
IT DEFINITELY HAD
THE COPS SNIFFING. I--

02:35.850 --> 02:37.850
YOU KNOW WHY YOUR SONG'S
BLOWING UP, RIGHT?

02:37.850 --> 02:40.520
"YOU TOOK A SHOT AT
MY MANS, NOW I'M WAITING
ON YOU, GUN IN MY HAND"?

02:40.520 --> 02:41.860
EVERYBODY THINKS
YOU DID IT.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.360
MAN, THOSE IS
JUST LYRICS, SPENCE.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.030
AND THE COPS KNOW THAT NOW.

02:45.030 --> 02:47.240
THAT'S WHY THEY QUESTIONING
A GANG OF OTHER PEOPLE.

02:47.240 --> 02:50.740
FLIP, PREACH'S HOMEBOY
KWON, AND WHOEVER ELSE.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.370
BUT AS FAR AS MY
INVOLVEMENT, IT'S OVER WITH.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.580
ALL RIGHT? SO CHILL.

02:55.580 --> 02:58.040
TYRONE IS DEAD, AND THIS
WHOLE DAMN NEIGHBORHOOD,

02:58.040 --> 03:00.540
MYSELF INCLUDED,
IS MOVING ON.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.540
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

03:21.100 --> 03:25.610
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS
SANCTUARY ALWAYS
BRINGS ME PEACE.

03:25.610 --> 03:28.240
I'VE MISSED IT.

03:29.740 --> 03:32.070
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
YOU BACK, RUTH.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.280
IT FELT LIKE IT
WAS THE RIGHT TIME
TO COME BACK.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.240
MM-HMM.

03:36.240 --> 03:38.750
PLUS, TASTE OF CRENSHAW
IS THIS WEEK.

03:38.750 --> 03:42.750
I'VE BEEN CHIEF
ORGANIZER EVERY YEAR
SINCE SHAWN WAS BORN.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.630
HOW'D I LOOK LEAVING
YOU ALL HANGING?

03:44.630 --> 03:46.920
IT AIN'T NO TASTE
OF CRENSHAW WITHOUT
YOUR 7-UP CAKE.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.300
YEAH, MS. ETHEL OFFERED
TO MAKE IT.

03:50.300 --> 03:55.260
THERE'S A REASON WE CALL
HERS 7-DOWN CAKE, OK?

03:55.260 --> 03:57.270
OH, MY GOODNESS.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.140
GUESS IT'S A GOOD THING
I'M HERE, THEN.

03:59.140 --> 04:01.600
IT'S DEFINITELY A GOOD
THING THAT YOU'RE HERE.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.450
WHAT'S UP, COACH?

04:10.450 --> 04:11.820
WHERE'S THE REST
OF THE SQUAD AT?

04:11.820 --> 04:13.450
YOU TEXTED THERE
WAS A PRACTICE.

04:13.450 --> 04:15.120
HAVE A SEAT.

04:19.120 --> 04:25.790
UH, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
ONE CHANCE TO COME CLEAN.

04:30.970 --> 04:32.470
OLIVIA TOLD YOU.

04:32.470 --> 04:35.300
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH YOU? STEROIDS?

04:35.300 --> 04:39.350
WHY WOULD YOU RISK
EVERYTHING AND PUT
THAT MESS IN YOUR SYSTEM?

04:39.350 --> 04:41.180
-WHY?
-TELL ME WHY.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.310
PRESSURE.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.030
MY ENTIRE LIFE IS...

04:51.820 --> 04:54.160
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
PRESSURE, COACH.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.700
FOOTBALL WAS
THE ONE THING THAT
I ALWAYS GOOD AT.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.000
I WAS THE BEST PLAYER
ON THIS TEAM.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.330
AND THEN ONE DAY,
I WASN'T.

05:04.330 --> 05:07.340
AND I JUST FIGURED WITH
A BIG SENIOR SEASON,
I COULD--

05:07.340 --> 05:10.170
HMM. THIS AIN'T
THE WAY, SON.

05:13.010 --> 05:15.010
I KNOW. AND I'M SORRY.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.850
YOU SORRY YOU GOT CAUGHT?

05:18.680 --> 05:19.850
NO, SIR.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.060
SORRY I LET YOU DOWN.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.690
SORRY I LET MY TEAM
DOWN.

05:33.360 --> 05:36.200
AT LEAST
IT'S FINALLY OVER.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.870
IS IT?

05:37.870 --> 05:39.870
THERE'S NO REASON TO
KEEP DOING STEROIDS

05:39.870 --> 05:41.370
IF I'M
OFF THE TEAM, SO...

05:44.040 --> 05:47.210
ALL RIGHT. WHAT IF I TOLD
YOU THAT MAYBE YOU, UM...

05:48.420 --> 05:50.210
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO BE OFF THE TEAM?

05:50.210 --> 05:53.420
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THAT I

05:53.420 --> 05:56.380
WAS WILLING
TO MAKE YOU A DEAL?

05:56.380 --> 05:57.930
WHY?

05:57.930 --> 06:01.100
'CAUSE I KNOW A LITTLE
SOMETHING ABOUT PRESSURE.

06:01.100 --> 06:05.560
AND GOD KNOWS I'VE MADE
MY MISTAKES, SO...

06:08.060 --> 06:10.900
YOU STOP TAKING
THAT CRAP TODAY,

06:10.900 --> 06:12.730
AND YOU REPORT TO ME
DAILY FOR URINE TESTS,

06:12.730 --> 06:13.940
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

06:13.940 --> 06:15.570
YES. ANYTHING, COACH.

06:15.570 --> 06:18.070
LOOK, BEFORE YOU GO,
WHERE IS IT?

06:25.910 --> 06:28.420
ALL RIGHT. LEAVE IT HERE.
I'LL GET RID OF IT.

06:30.630 --> 06:33.460
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE DISMISSED.

06:33.460 --> 06:35.920
CHRIS: SET. HUT!

06:41.930 --> 06:43.600
DON'T GET
FRUSTRATED, BRO.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.930
YOU GOT THIS.
IT'S JUST REHAB.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.100
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
ON IT. COME ON.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.480
LET'S RUN IT BACK.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.600
YOU KNOW WE'D REHAB
A LOT FASTER

06:49.600 --> 06:50.940
IF YOUR BOY WOULD
QUIT PASSING TO
YOUR WEAK SHOULDER.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.610
LET ME WORRY ABOUT
MY PASSES, ALL RIGHT?

06:52.610 --> 06:54.480
WE'RE DOING CONCENTRATION
DRILLS FOR FOCUS.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.440
YOU DO REALIZE ONE BAD
HIT TO HIS SHOULDER AGAIN,

06:56.440 --> 06:58.280
AND IT'S LIGHTS OUT.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.620
WELL, COACH BAKER MOVING
HIM TO HALFBACK.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.280
HE AIN'T GONNA BE
EXTENDING LIKE
A WIDE RECEIVER ANYWAY.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.330
DARNELL: ALL RIGHT. FINE.

07:04.330 --> 07:05.620
SINCE YOU WANT TO PLAY
A LITTLE COACH, YOU DO YOU.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.000
I JUST CAME TO HELP OUT.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.830
I'LL STICK TO MY QB SPOT.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.290
YOU MEAN MY QB SPOT.

07:10.290 --> 07:12.130
YO, Y'ALL CHILL, MAN.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.630
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE WITH
YOU ALL GOING AT EACH OTHER

07:13.630 --> 07:16.460
LIKE THIS, ALL RIGHT?

07:16.460 --> 07:18.130
CHRIS: LOOK, MY BAD,
SPENCE.

07:18.130 --> 07:20.010
LOOK, MAN, IT'S
SQUASHED. LET'S TRAIN.

07:20.010 --> 07:22.640
NO, MAN, IT'S ALL GOOD.
WE SHOULD CALL IT ANYWAY.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.970
MY HEAD AIN'T IN IT,
AND I WANT TO CHECK ON COOP.

07:24.970 --> 07:27.180
YO, SPENCE,
FOCUS ON YOUR FUTURE

07:27.180 --> 07:28.850
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S
UP IN THE AIR RIGHT NOW.

07:28.850 --> 07:30.690
COOP CAN HANDLE
HERSELF. LET'S GO.

07:30.690 --> 07:32.480
LOOK, DAWG, I DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU ALL DO IT

07:32.480 --> 07:33.980
WHEREVER THE HELL
YOU FROM,

07:33.980 --> 07:35.150
BUT HERE WE LOOK OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.820
REHAB'S OVER.

07:36.820 --> 07:38.530
-COME ON, MAN. DON'T--DON'T--
-SPENCE, HOLD UP.

07:52.830 --> 07:55.880
YOUR NEW D.A. JOB
GOT YOU WORKING
ROUND THE CLOCK ALREADY?

07:55.880 --> 07:57.510
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

07:57.510 --> 07:59.670
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T
OFFICIALLY TAKE OVER

07:59.670 --> 08:02.680
FOR A COUPLE MORE WEEKS.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.220
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

08:06.220 --> 08:07.890
YEAH, OF COURSE.

08:09.390 --> 08:11.350
TYRONE'S MURDER.

08:11.350 --> 08:14.520
ARE THE COPS REALLY DONE
WITH COOP AS A SUSPECT?

08:14.520 --> 08:17.030
SHE AND EVERYBODY ELSE
SEEM TO THINK SO.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.240
I GUESS I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN'T LET THINGS GO.

08:20.240 --> 08:23.740
SPENCER, I HAD
TO RECUSE MYSELF
FROM THE INVESTIGATION

08:23.740 --> 08:27.040
BECAUSE OF MY CONNECTION
TO BOTH COOP AND TYRONE.

08:27.040 --> 08:33.420
AND EVEN IF I HADN'T,
I--I CAN'T DISCUSS
ACTIVE CASES.

08:33.420 --> 08:37.210
OK. MY BAD.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.260
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT
TO WORRY.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.770
HOW MUCH TROUBLE
IS SHE IN?

08:52.770 --> 08:58.570
IF I WERE COOP, I WOULD
GET A REALLY GOOD LAWYER

08:58.570 --> 09:00.070
AND FAST.

09:08.780 --> 09:13.450
OKEY-DOKEY. SO WE HAVE
ALMOND MILK, SPINACH,

09:13.450 --> 09:16.780
CHIA SEEDS, GINGER,
GARLIC, AND BASICALLY
ANYTHING HEALTHY

09:16.780 --> 09:18.830
I FOUND IN THE FRIDGE,
I JUST TOSSED IN THERE.

09:18.830 --> 09:21.120
MMM.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.500
OK, LOOK, I ADMIT
IT DOESN'T TASTE
OR SMELL GREAT,

09:23.500 --> 09:27.630
BUT IT'S A TOP-RANKED
POWER BREAKFAST FOR
PREGO WOMEN, SO...

09:27.630 --> 09:32.470
AND IT'S VERY SWEET,
BUT YOU REALLY DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO ALL THIS.

09:32.470 --> 09:35.640
I WANT TO.
IT'S WORTH IT.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.470
LAURA: OK, GORDON RAMSAY,

09:37.470 --> 09:39.470
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
GET READY FOR SCHOOL

09:39.470 --> 09:40.640
SO YOU'RE
NOT LATE?

09:40.640 --> 09:42.480
I WON'T BE, MOM.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.850
I'M JUST MAKING SURE
SIMONE AND THE BABY
ARE GOOD TO GO.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.020
YOUR MOM'S RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD GO GET READY.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.650
I'LL EAT.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.820
OK. MAKE SURE
SHE DOES.

09:50.820 --> 09:51.860
OK.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.990
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EAT THAT, RIGHT?

10:00.160 --> 10:04.040
UM, COULD I HELP
FIX YOU SOMETHING?

10:04.040 --> 10:06.710
I MEAN, ASSUMING
JORDAN LEFT ANY FOOD
IN THE FRIDGE.

10:06.710 --> 10:09.170
YEAH. HE CAN, UH,
GET CARRIED AWAY

10:09.170 --> 10:11.340
WITH PEOPLE HE
CARES ABOUT.

10:11.340 --> 10:15.510
UM, MS. BAKER, YOU KNOW

10:15.510 --> 10:18.720
JORDAN DOESN'T HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ME, RIGHT?

10:18.720 --> 10:20.350
HE'S JUST BEING
REALLY KIND.

10:20.350 --> 10:25.020
YEAH. IT'S HIS KINDNESS
THAT WORRIES ME.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.520
'CAUSE KIND PEOPLE
GET HURT EASILY.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.730
WELL, I WOULDN'T
HURT JORDAN.

10:31.730 --> 10:33.860
YOU MEAN AGAIN?

10:37.240 --> 10:41.700
I MADE A MISTAKE
LYING TO JORDAN
ABOUT THE BABY.

10:41.700 --> 10:46.870
LOOK, SWEETHEART...

10:46.870 --> 10:50.540
YOU CAN STAY HERE
AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

10:50.540 --> 10:53.760
BUT WHAT IS YOUR PLAN
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN?

10:56.550 --> 10:58.390
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.930
CAN I GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE?

11:02.930 --> 11:04.560
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE A MOM.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.100
AND YOU NEED TO START
THINKING LIKE A MOM.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.070
BECAUSE NOT HAVING A PLAN
IS ONLY GOING TO HURT YOU

11:11.070 --> 11:17.570
AND THE BABY AND JORDAN,
WHO IS VERY INVESTED
IN YOU BOTH.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.460
LAYLA: SERIOUSLY,
YOU NEED TO STOP.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.250
YOU'VE LEFT COOP, LIKE,
4 MESSAGES ALREADY.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.750
YEAH. AND SHE STILL
AIN'T HIT ME BACK.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.460
SHE NOT TAKING THIS
TYRONE STUFF SERIOUS.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.760
I'M SURE SHE IS. SHE'S
PROBABLY JUST OVERWHELMED.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.300
I HATE FEELING HELPLESS.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.970
I GOT TO DO SOMETHING,
LIKE, CALL HER PARENTS.

11:40.970 --> 11:42.760
WELL, MAYBE I CAN HELP.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.270
YOU KNOW, MY DAD KNOWS
A BUNCH OF GREAT LAWYERS.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.100
I APPRECIATE THAT,
LAYLA, BUT COOP

11:46.100 --> 11:47.810
AIN'T GOT DEEP ENOUGH POCKETS
FOR A LAWYER ON THAT LEVEL.

11:47.810 --> 11:50.440
ME NEITHER. AND, NO, YOU
ARE NOT PAYING FOR IT.

11:50.440 --> 11:52.610
I'M THE ONE WHO GAVE
COOP'S TRACK TO
THE RADIO STATION

11:52.610 --> 11:54.110
THE DAY TYRONE DIED.

11:54.110 --> 11:55.780
YEAH, BUT YOU AIN'T KNOW
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.320
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT IT DID,

11:57.320 --> 11:59.450
AND NOW THE SONG IS
EVIDENCE AGAINST HER.

11:59.450 --> 12:01.450
SO YOU CAN THINK ABOUT
IT ALL YOU WANT. I'M NOT
TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.120
OLIVIA: WELL,
SO THIS IS MY FAULT?

12:03.120 --> 12:04.290
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.660
YEAH, BUT YOU
WERE THINKING IT.

12:05.660 --> 12:07.460
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU TOLD YOUR DAD.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.460
I FELT SO BLINDSIDED.

12:09.460 --> 12:13.630
OK, WELL, SO DID I
WHEN YOU LIED TO ME.

12:13.630 --> 12:15.300
YOU SAID YOU STOPPED
USING, AND THEN YOU
STARTED AGAIN

12:15.300 --> 12:16.630
BEFORE THE SCRIMMAGE.

12:16.630 --> 12:17.840
I DIDN'T LIE.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.970
OK? I MEANT IT
WHEN I SAID IT.

12:23.470 --> 12:25.970
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST GIVEN
ME A HEADS-UP YOU WERE
TELLING HIM, LIV.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.520
WHY? SO YOU COULD LIE
TO HIM, TOO?

12:28.520 --> 12:30.640
YOU BETRAYED MY TRUST.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.810
YOU WERE RELYING ON
A DRUG AS A QUICK FIX.

12:32.810 --> 12:37.490
AND IN MY EXPERIENCE,
ASHER, THAT ONLY
LEADS TO TROUBLE.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.490
AND I CAN'T BE IN
A RELATIONSHIP WITH
SOMEONE WHO'S USING.

12:40.490 --> 12:44.330
I CAN'T BE NEAR
THAT SLIPPERY SLOPE.
THAT'S WHY I TOLD MY DAD.

12:44.330 --> 12:49.000
I GET IT, BUT, BABE,
HE'S NOT JUST YOUR DAD.
HE'S ALSO MY COACH.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.500
I COULD'VE LOST
EVERYTHING.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.670
LOOK, I GOT TO GO.
I'VE GOT MY CHECK-IN
WITH YOUR DAD.

13:12.850 --> 13:14.730
YOUR PARENTS FINALLY
LET YOU OUT THE HOUSE, HUH?

13:14.730 --> 13:16.520
THEY DAMN NEAR DIDN'T
THANKS TO YOU.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.690
WHY DID I COME HOME TO
A LAWYER IN MY LIVING ROOM?

13:18.690 --> 13:20.860
IT'S J.P.'s ATTORNEY.
LAYLA CALLED IN A FAVOR.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.700
MAN, MY PARENTS ARE
FREAKING THE HELL OUT.

13:22.700 --> 13:24.370
THEY THOUGHT THIS WHOLE
SITUATION WAS DEAD,

13:24.370 --> 13:25.870
BUT NOW, NO.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.370
THANKS TO YOU AND THIS
FANCY LAWYER--

13:27.370 --> 13:29.250
IT AIN'T DEAD. THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.250
ACCORDING TO MRS. BAKER,
THE POLICE JUST
GETTING STARTED.

13:31.250 --> 13:33.040
BRO, AIN'T NOBODY
KNOCKING DOWN MY DOOR.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.380
AND ME GETTING A LAWYER
ONLY MAKES ME LOOK GUILTY.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.210
LOOK, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY
GOT SOME SERIOUS EVIDENCE
AGAINST YOU, ALL RIGHT?

13:38.210 --> 13:40.550
HOW? BUT I DIDN'T
KILL HIM.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.050
LOOK, I GET MS. BAKER'S
TRYING TO BE
EXTRA CAUTIOUS

13:43.050 --> 13:45.220
'CAUSE SHE CARES
ABOUT ME,

13:45.220 --> 13:46.890
BUT WHATEVER EVIDENCE
THEY CLAIMING TO HAVE,
IT DON'T EXIST.

13:46.890 --> 13:48.890
SO STOP FREAKING OUT
MY PARENTS.

13:48.890 --> 13:50.100
I'M JUST TRYING
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.230
IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?

13:52.230 --> 13:54.560
AM I SERIOUSLY GETTING
IN TROUBLE FOR TRYING TO
HELP OUT MY BEST FRIEND?

13:54.560 --> 13:56.230
NO, YOU'RE GETTING IN
TROUBLE FOR CREATING
MORE PROBLEMS IN MY LIFE,

13:56.230 --> 13:57.900
TRYING TO HIDE
FROM YOUR OWN.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.110
LOOK, YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW THAT YOU WAKE UP

14:04.110 --> 14:05.910
EVERY MORNING
QUESTIONING

14:05.910 --> 14:07.240
IF YOU GONNA BE THAT
SAME BALLER AGAIN?

14:07.240 --> 14:08.910
WE AIN'T TALKING ABOUT
ME RIGHT NOW.

14:08.910 --> 14:10.450
LISTEN, I'MA SAY THIS
ONE LAST TIME.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.580
YOU DO NOT
HAVE TO SAVE ME,

14:13.580 --> 14:16.790

15:36.660 --> 15:38.330
OH, STOP IT.
JUST DOING WHAT I CAN.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.330
AND IT'S BEYOND
APPRECIATED.

15:40.330 --> 15:42.840
IT FELT GOOD TO POUR

SOUTH CRENSHAW HIGH.

15:44.510 --> 15:46.840
-AND OUR STOMACHS THANK YOU.
-HA HA!

15:46.840 --> 15:48.680
WEEKS: IN FACT, I THINK IT ONLY
RIGHT THAT I TASTE TEST

15:48.680 --> 15:50.180

15:50.180 --> 15:52.350
JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU
HAVEN'T LOST YOUR TOUCH.

15:52.350 --> 15:54.010
UH, PASTOR, IF YOU

15:54.010 --> 15:56.680
DON'T PUT THAT FORK DOWN
AND BACK AWAY FROM THE CAKE.

15:58.690 --> 16:01.190
HA HA!

16:01.190 --> 16:04.190
SHAWN LOVED THIS EVENT.

16:04.190 --> 16:08.860
IT'S OK, RUTH. THERE'S
NO TIME CLOCK ON HEALING.

16:08.860 --> 16:14.740
YOU KNOW, I LEFT HERE
THINKING THAT TYRONE
WAS SHAWN'S FRIEND.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.870
HE WAS SUCH A COMFORT TO
ME AT SHAWN'S FUNERAL,

16:17.870 --> 16:21.540
ONLY TO FIND OUT HE
HAD HIM KILLED.

16:21.540 --> 16:24.590
THAT'S A TOUGH PILL
TO SWALLOW.

16:24.590 --> 16:27.880
FOR YOU TO COME BACK
AND FACE EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED,

16:27.880 --> 16:30.050
THAT SHOWS REMARKABLE
STRENGTH, RUTH.

16:30.050 --> 16:32.890
I OWED IT TO
BOTH MY BOYS.

16:32.890 --> 16:35.220
I WAS GONNA GO
TO THE POLICE

16:35.220 --> 16:37.930
AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT
NOT LETTING MY SON'S
KILLER WALK FREE, BUT--

16:37.930 --> 16:40.560
BUT THE UNIVERSE GAVE YOU
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF JUSTICE.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.110
AND YET IT DOESN'T MAKE
ME FEEL ANY BETTER
KNOWING THAT HE'S DEAD.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.570
IT DOESN'T BRING
MY BOYS BACK.

16:58.250 --> 16:59.910
WE HAVE A PROBLEM,
COACH.

16:59.910 --> 17:01.290
I KNOW. IF YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE TIMING ROUTES

17:01.290 --> 17:04.130
FOR OUR RECEIVERS,
I'M ALL OVE--

17:04.130 --> 17:06.590
A CUSTODIAN FOUND IT
ROLLED UNDERNEATH
ONE OF THE TRASH CANS

17:06.590 --> 17:08.260
IN THE LOCKER ROOM
EARLIER THIS WEEK.

17:08.260 --> 17:09.760
HUH.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.300
IT MEANS YOU HAVE
A PLAYER USING

17:11.300 --> 17:12.760
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING
DRUGS.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.600
-YEAH.
-ANY IDEA WHO THAT WOULD BE?

17:14.600 --> 17:16.600
-NO.
-NO GUESSES?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.270
WELL, IT WOULDN'T BE
FAIR OF ME TO GUESS

17:18.270 --> 17:20.140
ABOUT SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, NOW, WOULD IT?

17:23.270 --> 17:25.270
NO. YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:25.270 --> 17:28.110
I MEAN, I DON'T
TOLERATE STEROIDS ON
THIS TEAM, LONDON.

17:28.110 --> 17:30.940
OK. YOU SAY YOU DON'T
KNOW WHO IT IS,

17:30.940 --> 17:32.950
I HAVE NO REASON
TO DOUBT YOU.

17:32.950 --> 17:34.490
OK.

17:34.490 --> 17:36.120
BUT I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO HELP ME FIND OUT

17:36.120 --> 17:37.620
WHO THIS BELONGS TO.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.120
I NEED TO KNOW
BY TOMORROW.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.460
AND IF I CAN'T?

17:45.460 --> 17:48.670
THEN I'LL BE FORCED
TO SUSPEND THE ENTIRE
FOOTBALL TEAM.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.520
WHOA, WHOA. WHOA. HEY.
HEY. SHOULD YOU, UH,

18:05.520 --> 18:07.150
SHOULD YOU BE
CARRYING THOSE?

18:07.150 --> 18:09.650
I AM PREGNANT,
NOT INCAPABLE, OK?

18:09.650 --> 18:12.820
-RIGHT. SORRY.
-IT'S FINE.

18:12.820 --> 18:15.990
UH, YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO ALL THIS.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.830
WE HAVE PLENTY OF
GROCERIES.

18:17.830 --> 18:22.660
HAD. BESIDES, IT WAS
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.540
SIMONE, IS EVERYTHING OK?
IS THE BABY OK?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.670
THE BABY'S FINE.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.010
COULD WE PLEASE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING OTHER
THAN THE BABY?

18:34.510 --> 18:38.350
I MEAN, WE'RE ALWAYS
SO FOCUSED ON ME.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

18:38.350 --> 18:41.060
-WHAT ABOUT ME?
-I DON'T KNOW.

18:41.060 --> 18:42.730
HOW'S FOOTBALL?

18:42.730 --> 18:45.850
IS VISUAL ARTS CLASS
STILL KICKING YOUR ASS?

18:45.850 --> 18:49.520
ARE YOU DATING?

18:51.530 --> 18:54.860
I THINK YOU WOULD KNOW
IF I WAS DATING
SOMEBODY, SIMONE.

18:56.360 --> 18:57.870
SO NO CRUSHES?

18:57.870 --> 19:01.540
WHAT? NAH. NO. OF COURSE NOT.

19:01.540 --> 19:08.040
JORDAN, YOU DO KNOW
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS
PLATONIC, RIGHT?

19:08.040 --> 19:12.050
PLATONIC. UH, SO YOU
MEAN, LIKE, OUR SIGNS
ARE COMPATIBLE.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.880
NO. JORDAN, I MEAN,
LIKE, YOU AND I ARE--

19:14.880 --> 19:18.220
I'M KIDDING, OK?
OF COURSE I DO.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.550
I JUST--I CARE ABOUT
YOU AND THE BABY.

19:20.550 --> 19:24.100
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP IS
IMPORTANT TO ME.

19:28.940 --> 19:30.560
WHY ARE YOU BRINGING
THIS UP NOW?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.570
NO REASON.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.230
JUST IGNORE ME
AND MY PREGNANCY BRAIN.

19:34.230 --> 19:38.110
UM, FORGET I
EVEN MENTIONED IT.

19:39.910 --> 19:43.410
♪ GONE, GONE, GONE, GONE, GONE ♪

19:46.910 --> 19:50.580
♪ GONE, GONE, GONE,
GONE, GONE... ♪

19:52.090 --> 19:55.420
UM, HEY, KIA, I THOUGHT
WE WERE MEETING AT THE CAFE.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.090
I'M NOT THAT LATE.

19:57.090 --> 20:00.590
UM, YEAH, HIT ME--HIT ME UP.

20:16.440 --> 20:18.280
HEY, YOU OK?

20:18.280 --> 20:22.280
HI. YEAH, UH, I'M FINE.

20:22.280 --> 20:24.120
THAT WAS JUST A CHAIR
FALLING OVER.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.620
I JUST--I THOUGHT
IT WAS SOMETHING--

20:25.620 --> 20:27.500
SOMETHING ELSE.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.790
YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT
THE SHOOTING.

20:29.790 --> 20:32.330
YEAH, I GUESS IT'S
STILL FRESH.

20:32.330 --> 20:33.960
NOW, THE FIRST TIME
I SEEN SOMEBODY GET SHOT--

20:33.960 --> 20:36.300
CHRIS, I'M FINE. REALLY.

20:36.300 --> 20:39.970
CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT
PEOPLE GETTING SHOT?

20:39.970 --> 20:42.800
YEAH. SORRY.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.470
IT'S REALLY NICE TO
SEE YOU WALKING AGAIN.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.640
AH.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.190
YEAH, IT IS, UM,
KIND OF NICE.

20:51.190 --> 20:54.860
LOOK, I THINK
I SHOULD JUST, UM,
RIP THE BAND-AID OFF.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.860
I THINK I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

20:56.860 --> 20:59.490
BREAKING UP WITH YOU
OVER TEXT WAS A LITTLE--

20:59.490 --> 21:02.160
SHADY?

21:02.160 --> 21:04.990
WE'RE PAST IT.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.830
AND YOU'RE WITH ASHER.

21:07.830 --> 21:10.000
HA HA! NO,
SPENCER TOLD ME.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I MEAN, I CAN'T SAY
I'M SURPRISED

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
SINCE YOU WAS DAMN
NEAR WITH ASHER WHEN WE
WERE TOGETHER, SO...

21:14.000 --> 21:15.710
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

21:15.710 --> 21:17.340
LIV, IT'S A LITTLE TRUE.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.840
ALL THE DAMAGE CONTROL YOU
USED TO DO IN HIS LIFE.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.550
-YEAH.
-YEAH.

21:21.550 --> 21:24.550
YEAH. APPARENTLY,
THAT'S A HABIT.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.720
OH SNAP. WHAT, TROUBLE
IN PARADISE ALREADY?

21:26.720 --> 21:28.890
I DON'T KNOW.

21:28.890 --> 21:31.690
HE'S BATTLING WITH
SOME STUFF THAT I CAN'T
REALLY TALK ABOUT.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.350
AND I JUST--I JUST HOPE
I DID THE RIGHT THING BY

21:34.350 --> 21:36.190
TRYING TO HELP HIM.

21:36.190 --> 21:38.230
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HELPING SOMEBODY
YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT

21:38.230 --> 21:40.360
IS NEVER A BAD CALL.

21:40.360 --> 21:43.070
JUST MAKE SURE IT'S NOT
AT THE EXPENSE OF YOU
TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.

21:44.530 --> 21:46.700
THANKS.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.040
WELL, I SHOULD GO
FIND KIA, BUT, UM...

21:52.040 --> 21:54.540
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND?

21:54.540 --> 21:56.540
YEAH.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.550
COOL. BYE.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.390
LAYLA: OK, YOU HAVE
GOT TO TRY THIS.

22:07.390 --> 22:10.220
THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST
PEACH COBBLER I'VE EVER HAD.

22:10.220 --> 22:11.930
APPARENTLY,
SINCE IT'S ALL GONE.

22:11.930 --> 22:14.060
DAMN.

22:14.060 --> 22:16.060
IS COOP STILL
NOT TALKING TO YOU?

22:16.060 --> 22:18.070
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SHE'S RIGHT.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.400
MAYBE THIS IS MORE
ABOUT ME NEEDING HER
TO HAVE A PROBLEM

22:20.400 --> 22:22.570
SO I CAN KEEP
HIDING FROM MINE.

22:22.570 --> 22:24.910
SPENCER, YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE IT BACK
ONTO THE FIELD.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.570
YOU FOUGHT TOO HARD
NOT TO.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.240
AND AS FOR COOP,
MY DAD SAID

22:28.240 --> 22:30.240
SHE DIDN'T FIRE
THE LAWYER,
SO THAT'S SOMETHING.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.410
HEY, Y'ALL.
YOU SEEN OLIVIA?

22:32.410 --> 22:35.250
UM, WEREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO MEET HER
AT SLAUSON CAFE?

22:35.250 --> 22:38.960
DAMN. OK.
I MUST'VE MISSED HER.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.920
HOW'S YOUR
SHOULDER HOLDING UP?

22:41.920 --> 22:44.090
IT'S GETTING THERE.
THANKS.

22:44.090 --> 22:46.590
ALL RIGHT. UH, I'LL
SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.430
HEY, WAIT. CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

22:48.430 --> 22:50.640
WHAT'S UP?

22:50.640 --> 22:52.270
THE COPS QUESTIONED
FLIP ABOUT TYRONE'S
MURDER, RIGHT?

22:52.270 --> 22:54.100
THINK HE DID IT?

22:54.100 --> 22:56.600
I LEARNED A LONG TIME
AGO TO STAY OUT OF
MY UNCLE'S BUSINESS.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.610
I JUST DON'T WANT
COOP GOING DOWN FOR
SOMETHING SHE AIN'T DO.

22:58.610 --> 23:00.770
ALL I KNOW IS WHEN
TYRONE CAME BACK...

23:00.770 --> 23:03.110
MY UNCLE MADE ME
AND MY FAM LEAVE TOWN
FOR A FEW DAYS.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.990
I MEAN, HE ONLY DOES
THAT WHEN STUFF'S
ABOUT TO POP OFF.

23:10.660 --> 23:12.160
WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

23:12.160 --> 23:15.000
WE NEED TO FIND
COOP NOW.

23:16.290 --> 23:19.460
-HEY, MAN, THOSE IS 4.50.
-4.50?!

23:19.460 --> 23:21.460
-YEAH.
-THE SIGN SAYS A SLICE IS $3.00.

23:21.460 --> 23:22.800
I DON'T CARE
WHAT THAT SIGN SAY.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.170
IT'S CALLED SUPPLY
AND DEMAND, BRO.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.970
YOU SEE THAT LONG LINE
YOU GOT BEHIND YOU?

23:25.970 --> 23:27.510
AND I ONLY GOT
A FEW PIECES LEFT.

23:27.510 --> 23:29.140
SO EITHER YOU WANT IT
OR YOU DON'T?

23:29.140 --> 23:31.810
ALL RIGHT.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.140
THERE YOU GO.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.640
YO--

23:43.150 --> 23:44.530
HEY, SPENCE,
EVERYTHING GOOD?

23:44.530 --> 23:46.700
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, HUH?

23:46.700 --> 23:49.660
WOMAN ON VIDEO:
A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE
AT THE LAPD HAS CONFIRMED

23:49.660 --> 23:54.200
THIS LEAKED VIDEO IS
CONNECTED TO THE TYRONE MOORE
MURDER INVESTIGATION.

23:57.330 --> 23:58.870
SPENCER: COOP, THAT'S YOU
WITH A GUN.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.680
JANELLE: INSIDE. NO, TAMIA,
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.890
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT
IT LOOKS LIKE,

24:12.890 --> 24:15.060
BUT I SWEAR I WAS JUST
GOING TO TALK TO TYRONE,

24:15.060 --> 24:17.850
BUT BEFORE I COULD,
SHOTS RANG OUT, SO I RAN.

24:17.850 --> 24:20.230
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
US YOU WERE ANYWHERE
NEAR THIS PLACE?

24:20.230 --> 24:21.690
WE COULD'VE GOT AHEAD
OF THIS THING.

24:21.690 --> 24:23.190
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
HAD A GUN?

24:23.190 --> 24:24.520
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO
EXPLAIN THAT RIGHT NOW.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.530
-MAKE TIME.
-ALL RIGHT.

24:26.530 --> 24:28.070
LOOK, LET'S JUST TAKE
A SECOND AND CALM DOWN,
ALL RIGHT?

24:28.070 --> 24:29.700
SPENCER, YOU NEED
TO STAY OUT OF THIS.

24:29.700 --> 24:31.200
COOP: LOOK, MA, I NEED
TO GO GET THAT GUN, OK?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.870
IT WASN'T USED
TO KILL TYRONE.

24:32.870 --> 24:35.370
THEY CAN TEST IT.
THEY CAN DO WHATEVER.

24:35.370 --> 24:37.410
WELL, YOU ARE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE,
AND NOT BY YOURSELF.

24:37.410 --> 24:40.370
REGGIE, CALL
THE ATTORNEY BACK.
SHE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

24:40.370 --> 24:41.880
OK.

24:43.540 --> 24:45.880
AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

24:48.090 --> 24:49.880
I CAN'T USE
THE BATHROOM NOW?

24:53.550 --> 24:55.890
JANELLE,
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.560
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.430
I DO 'CAUSE I KNOW
YOUR DAUGHTER.

24:59.430 --> 25:01.230
AND, LOOK, I KNOW HOW
THAT VIDEO LOOKS,

25:01.230 --> 25:02.900
BUT WE ALL KNOW COOP.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.610
SHE NOT CAPABLE OF
TAKING A LIFE.

25:04.610 --> 25:06.070
THANK YOU, SPENCER.

25:07.780 --> 25:09.070
WHERE THE HELL
IS COOP?

25:09.070 --> 25:11.240
IN THE BATHROOM.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.240
REGGIE: I JUST
WENT BY THE BATHROOM,
AND SHE AIN'T IN THERE.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.620
WHAT?

25:23.080 --> 25:24.920
NEED A SPOT?

25:24.920 --> 25:29.130
NO, THE STEROIDS
GAVE ME SUPER STRENGTH,
SO I'M GOOD.

25:34.090 --> 25:35.430
THAT WAS A JOKE.

25:35.430 --> 25:38.270
-BAD JOKE.
-I KNOW.

25:41.810 --> 25:43.940
I'M SORRY.

25:43.940 --> 25:48.280
WHATEVER.
YOU'VE TOLD WORSE.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.780
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE JOKE.

25:50.780 --> 25:53.660
I'M DONE USING THAT
STUFF, LIV. I PROMISE.

25:53.660 --> 25:56.830
IT WASN'T FAIR FOR ME TO
PUT YOU IN THAT POSITION.

25:56.830 --> 26:00.620
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
IT WASN'T FUN.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.120
BUT I'M SORRY, TOO.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.670
I SHOULD'VE GIVEN YOU
A HEADS-UP

26:05.670 --> 26:07.460
BEFORE TELLING MY DAD.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.130
NAH, I WOULD'VE JUST
TALKED YOU OUT OF IT.

26:12.630 --> 26:14.680
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.800
I JUST DON'T WANT
YOU TO THINK THAT
YOU CAN'T TRUST ME.

26:16.800 --> 26:17.970
HEY.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.690
I LOVE YOU,
AND I TRUST YOU.

26:23.690 --> 26:26.650
YOU NEVER HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR TRYING TO HELP ME.

26:26.650 --> 26:28.320
THANK YOU.

26:37.530 --> 26:41.830
-IS THAT 4 OLIVES?
-UH-HUH.

26:41.830 --> 26:44.160
WOW. BAD DAY.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.370
I ALMOST USED 5.

26:45.370 --> 26:47.170
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

26:48.880 --> 26:50.380
LOOK, LAURA,
YOU DON'T NEED TO--

26:50.380 --> 26:52.710
BILLY.

26:52.710 --> 26:56.380
JUST 'CAUSE WE'RE SEPARATED
DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T
BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER.

26:59.850 --> 27:02.560
PRINCIPAL LONDON FOUND
A VIAL OF STEROIDS

27:02.560 --> 27:04.390
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.520
-WHAT?
-YEAH.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.020
DO YOU KNOW WHO
THEY BELONG TO?

27:08.020 --> 27:10.360
ASHER.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.530
IF I DON'T TELL
HIM WHOSE IT IS,

27:12.530 --> 27:15.860
HE SAID HE WOULD SUSPEND
THE ENTIRE FOOTBALL TEAM.

27:15.860 --> 27:18.240
AND ASHER'S CLEAN NOW.
HE'S NOT USING.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.240
BUT HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO TURN HIM IN

27:20.240 --> 27:22.080
WHEN I HELPED JORDAN
CHEAT ON HIS DRUG TEST

27:22.080 --> 27:23.870
IN THE PLAYOFFS
JUST MONTHS AGO?

27:23.870 --> 27:26.870
YEAH, BUT THOSE ARE
TWO ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.

27:26.870 --> 27:29.210
NOT FROM WHERE
I'M STANDING.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.210
I KNOW ASH MADE
A MISTAKE,

27:31.210 --> 27:33.420
AND HE'S TRYING REALLY
HARD TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

27:33.420 --> 27:37.880
IF I TURN HIM IN,
THEN HE'LL LOSE
EVERYTHING.

27:37.880 --> 27:40.720
DAD, THANKS
FOR HELPING ASHER.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.600
HEY. YES, YES,
BABY GIRL.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.730
-HEY.
-HEY.

27:46.730 --> 27:48.560
LAURA: HOW WAS
THE TASTE OF CRENSHAW?

27:48.560 --> 27:50.230
OH, I NEVER QUITE MADE IT.

27:50.230 --> 27:52.270
BUT, UM, NO. WHAT'S
ALL THIS I'M HEARING

27:52.270 --> 27:55.280
ABOUT SURVEILLANCE
FOOTAGE OF COOP?

27:55.280 --> 27:59.450
YEAH. I'VE BEEN CHECKING IN
ON THE CASE.

27:59.450 --> 28:01.070
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.740
GOD. THIS IS GONNA RIP
SPENCER APART.

28:03.740 --> 28:06.620
I MEAN, COOP MEANS
EVERYTHING TO HIM.

28:06.620 --> 28:08.250
YOU KNOW, I BET
IF HE COULD,

28:08.250 --> 28:09.960
HE WOULD TRADE PLACES
WITH HER RIGHT NOW

28:09.960 --> 28:12.790
AND GIVE UP HIS FUTURE
FOR HERS.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.760
HEY. LOOK, I CHECKED
THE RESTROOM.
COOP'S NOT THERE.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.630
MY MOMS AND PASTOR WEEKS
IS STILL SEARCHING
THE TASTE OF CRENSHAW.

28:19.630 --> 28:21.590
BUT AIN'T
NO SIGN OF HER.

28:21.590 --> 28:22.800
AND HER PHONE JUST KEEPS
GOING STRAIGHT TO VOICEMAIL.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.430
LOOK, I'M WORRIED, LAYLA.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.100
HAS ANYONE TRIED
CALLING PATIENCE AGAIN?

28:26.100 --> 28:27.430
YEAH, SHE'S ON HER WAY BACK
FROM THE RECORDING STUDIO,

28:27.430 --> 28:29.100
BUT SHE AIN'T HEARD FROM
HER NEITHER.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.440
-THAT'S MY DAD. I'LL BE BACK.
-ALL RIGHT.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.810
HEY, MS. RUTH,
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

28:32.810 --> 28:34.440
I'M LOOKING FOR COOP.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.780
-YEAH, WE ALL ARE.
-SO SHE'S NOT HERE?

28:36.780 --> 28:38.610
SPENCER,
THAT VIDEO.

28:38.610 --> 28:40.280
I KNOW. IT'S BAD, BUT, LOOK,

28:40.280 --> 28:41.610
AS SOON AS WE FIND HER,
WE GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT.

28:41.610 --> 28:43.280
COOP WAS LIKE FAMILY
TO MY BOY.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.290
I HATE THAT SHE'S
CAUGHT UP IN ALL THIS.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.290
WHY COULDN'T TYRONE
JUST LEAVE EVERYONE BE?

28:47.290 --> 28:48.620
OK, LOOK, MAYBE YOU
GOT TO SIT DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

28:48.620 --> 28:50.120
LET ME GET YOU SOME WATER.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.130
NO, NO, NO. I'M FINE.
I SHOULD GO.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.960
IT'S ALL OVER
THE NEWS.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.960
POLICE ISSUED
A WARRANT FOR
COOP'S ARREST.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.480
I JUST
DON'T GET IT.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.480
HOW DOES SOMEBODY
SO SWEET, SO INNOCENT--

29:10.480 --> 29:11.640
HOW DOES SOMEBODY
LIKE THAT TAKE
SOMEBODY'S ELSE'S LIFE?

29:11.640 --> 29:13.190
YOU MEAN COOP?

29:13.190 --> 29:14.650
I JUST GOT TO GET
MY HEAD AROUND IT.

29:14.650 --> 29:16.190
THE MIND IS A FRAGILE
THING, SPENCER,

29:16.190 --> 29:17.980
ESPECIALLY A GRIEVING ONE.

29:17.980 --> 29:20.200
YOU KNOW, TYRONE
TOOK SHAWN FROM HER.
HE TOOK PREACH.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.820
HE TRIED TO HAVE YOU KILLED.

29:21.820 --> 29:24.030
THAT MUCH PAIN AND GRIEF
CAN MAKE ANYONE SNAP.

29:24.030 --> 29:26.700
IT HAPPENED TO ME
JUST IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.380
OK, LOOK, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

29:35.380 --> 29:38.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU WORKED THINGS
OUT WITH YOUR EX?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.170
I MEAN DANE AND I TALKED.

29:40.170 --> 29:42.010
WE STILL HAVE STUFF
TO WORK OUT,

29:42.010 --> 29:44.220
BUT HIS PARENTS SAID I
COULD STAY OVER THERE
WHILE WE DO.

29:44.220 --> 29:46.680
SIMONE, HE LEFT YOU
PREGNANT AND ALONE
AND DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.520
-AND HE'S SORRY.
-WHOA. WHOA. WHOA.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.680
JUST LIKE THAT?
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?

29:51.680 --> 29:54.850
NOTHING. I'M JUST GETTING
MY LIFE TOGETHER.

29:54.850 --> 29:56.360
AND I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE
ON YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

29:56.360 --> 29:57.860
YOU'RE NOT IMPOSING.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.690
JORDAN, I DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE WITH YOU, OK?

30:00.690 --> 30:02.530
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S THE TRUTH.

30:05.530 --> 30:10.040
GOT IT.
I'LL STAY OUT OF
YOUR WAY, THEN.

UP ANY SECOND.

32:27.510 --> 32:31.510
NO. I NEED TO SIT DOWN

32:36.350 --> 32:42.020
THE GUN THAT COULD'VE
CLEARED ME IS GONE.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.360
SO I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TURN MYSELF IN.

32:58.040 --> 33:00.370
YOU DIDN'T
KILL TYRONE.

33:00.370 --> 33:03.040
COME ON, MAN.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.590
THE SHOTS RANG OUT ON
THAT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO

33:05.590 --> 33:07.380
MOMENTS
AFTER YOU WALKED AWAY.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.880
YOU SAW THE SHOOTER,
DIDN'T YOU?

33:12.390 --> 33:15.560
YEAH. PLEASE DON'T ASK ME WHO.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.390
I ALREADY KNOW.

33:17.390 --> 33:18.890
THERE'S ONLY
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

33:18.890 --> 33:20.560
YOU'D BE WILLING TO
TAKE THE RAP FOR.

33:23.230 --> 33:26.230
SHAWN'S MOM
KILLED TYRONE.

33:29.070 --> 33:31.240
WHAT, ARE YOU PSYCHIC?

33:31.240 --> 33:34.070
THE MIND IS
A FRAGILE THING,

33:34.070 --> 33:35.740
ESPECIALLY
A GRIEVING ONE.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.250
IT TOOK ME A SECOND
TO CONNECT THE DOTS,

33:39.250 --> 33:42.790
BUT AFTER I RAN INTO HER
AT THE CAFE EARLIER--

33:42.790 --> 33:44.790
PANICKED,
LOOKING FOR YOU--

33:44.790 --> 33:46.750
IT ALL CLICKED.

33:48.590 --> 33:51.970
MAN, TYRONE TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM HER.

33:51.970 --> 33:56.600
I GUESS SOMETHING
IN HER JUST BROKE.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.930
YOU CAN'T TURN
YOURSELF IN FOR
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO.

33:58.930 --> 34:01.930
I'M NOT GONNA TURN

34:10.610 --> 34:12.780
