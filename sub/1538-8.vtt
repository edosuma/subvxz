WEBVTT

00:26.027 --> 00:29.028
I can't lose him.

00:31.065 --> 00:35.000
I won't have him committed.
I won't.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.336
No one is suggesting
an institution for dandy.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.905
I refuse to hear
that word uttered

00:39.907 --> 00:41.540
In the same sentence
with his name.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.342
It's an abdication
of responsibility,

00:43.344 --> 00:44.977
Dr. Feinbloom.

00:44.979 --> 00:47.846
Believe me, gloria,
it's the furthest thing

00:47.848 --> 00:49.681
From my mind, but

00:49.683 --> 00:51.750
Apparently not
from from yours.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.986
Dandy's always been
a willful child.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.957
I often thought of him
as a foreigner.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.195
A perfectly groomed
aristocratic boy

01:03.197 --> 01:05.264
Who could play the part

01:05.266 --> 01:07.833
But didn't quite understand
the language.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.702
<i>Because words had a different</i>

01:10.704 --> 01:11.837
<i>Meaning for him.</i>

01:13.941 --> 01:16.141
<i>Particularly the word "no."</i>

01:17.111 --> 01:20.679
<i>"no" was an affront.</i>

01:20.681 --> 01:24.083
<i>"no" was a battle cry.</i>

01:26.887 --> 01:30.889
<i>I had complained about</i>
<i>the cat digging up my azaleas.</i>

01:30.891 --> 01:33.025
<i>So he killed the poor animal.</i>

01:34.061 --> 01:35.761
From that moment on,

01:35.763 --> 01:38.097
I never let dandy
out of my sight.

01:38.099 --> 01:39.465
Of course,
i knew he had to

01:39.467 --> 01:42.067
Socialize with children.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.236
The boy never learned to play.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.571
(child's laugh echoes)

01:45.573 --> 01:47.706
<i>He found a perfect companion</i>

01:47.708 --> 01:49.908
<i>With the gardener's son, emil.</i>

01:49.910 --> 01:51.910
<i>Beautiful little boy.</i>

01:51.912 --> 01:54.746
<i>They would roam the grounds</i>
<i>together, happy as clams.</i>

01:54.748 --> 01:57.483
<i>I relaxed, thinking my vigil</i>

01:57.485 --> 01:59.952
<i>Had become unnecessary.</i>

01:59.954 --> 02:03.088
<i>One day, the boy vanished.</i>
(child's laugh echoes)

02:03.090 --> 02:06.125
They searched
everywhere for him.

02:11.332 --> 02:15.033
But... Emil
was never seen again.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.639
It's time, gloria.
I need to see him.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.008
He would never agree
to psychoanalysis.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.076
Then tell him
it's something else.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.311
I'll clear
my schedule.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.780
Gloria, were
there any

02:28.782 --> 02:31.016
Recent incidents...

02:31.018 --> 02:34.019
(screaming)
aah! Dandy!
Dandy: Mother!

02:34.021 --> 02:36.622
...That triggered this
anxiety about your son?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.690
Just a mother's intuition.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.397
Jimmy:
Ma petite!
(dogs barking)

03:52.399 --> 03:55.601
She's so tiny. She could be
in a hole somewhere,

03:55.603 --> 03:57.536
Screaming, and we wouldn't
hear her, let alone see her.

03:57.538 --> 04:01.106
Petite?
Jimmy: Ma petite.
Where are you?

04:01.108 --> 04:03.408
You head toward that clearing,

04:03.410 --> 04:06.511
I'll hug the riverbed.
Take dimaggio.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.181
Come on, boy.
Come on. Find, find.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.782
Ma petite!

04:10.784 --> 04:13.018
(barking continues)

04:13.020 --> 04:15.187
You got something, boy?
You got something?

04:15.189 --> 04:17.289
Ma petite!
Find it.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.658
Find it.
Ma petite!

04:22.930 --> 04:25.831
(screams)

04:43.951 --> 04:46.018
(gasps)
oh. (cries)

04:49.757 --> 04:52.658
No... No body?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.259
Dell:
Looks like an
animal took her.

04:54.261 --> 04:56.295
Maybe a coyote.

04:56.297 --> 04:59.331
Amazon eve:
Bones and all.

04:59.333 --> 05:03.201
Oh, no.
(crying)

05:12.613 --> 05:14.046
(sobbing):
Oh, no.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.450
Oh, no, no, no,

05:18.452 --> 05:21.586
No, no.
God.

05:21.588 --> 05:25.490
Oh, no, no.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.726
Oh.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.669
Thought you'd be high
as a limehouse whore

05:37.671 --> 05:39.504
By now.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.876
She was too good
for this place, you know?

05:48.549 --> 05:52.818
God put his very own light

05:52.820 --> 05:55.420
Into that little angel.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.993
It was as if he knew

06:01.995 --> 06:04.229
That the world could only handle

06:04.231 --> 06:07.699
A tiny bit of his love at once.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.204
Well, come on.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.272
Oh.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.877
Oh, edna.
Looks like

06:18.879 --> 06:20.746
You have already taken steps

06:20.748 --> 06:23.081
To dull your pain.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.549
A woman's entitled

06:24.551 --> 06:27.152
To a little nip or two

06:27.154 --> 06:29.988
On a dark night of the soul.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.557
Sit. Eat.

06:34.528 --> 06:37.095
We will mourn her.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.731
Christmas is canceled.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.800
I made mock turtle soup.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.507
That was quite a show
you put on in that tent.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.043
Regular joan fontaine.

06:52.045 --> 06:55.914
I've seen you bring a
full house to their feet,

06:55.916 --> 06:59.017
But you have never been better
than you were tonight.

06:59.019 --> 07:02.921
You have got it, elsa mars.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.691
The sobs over ma petite.

07:06.693 --> 07:10.228
Clutching her bloody dress--
that was a nice touch.

07:10.230 --> 07:14.032
Bit of a house
note, but damn...

07:14.034 --> 07:16.835
I almost believed
you meant it.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.372
(grunts)

07:20.374 --> 07:22.207
How dare you?

07:23.310 --> 07:26.511
She was my most precious one.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.483
All that's precious to you
is the roar of the crowd.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.420
And god forbid
someone comes along

07:35.422 --> 07:38.023
And steals your spotlight.
(drumroll, applause)

07:41.962 --> 07:45.063
(whooping, cheering)

08:06.987 --> 08:08.787
You know,

08:08.789 --> 08:12.190
I have seen the way whiskey
can ravage the mind,

08:12.192 --> 08:14.359
But you come in here tonight

08:14.361 --> 08:16.628
And you accuse me of what?

08:16.630 --> 08:20.165
Of killing innocence
itself? Huh?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.000
Get out!

08:22.002 --> 08:24.035
14 years.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.837
I've brought you your tray,

08:25.839 --> 08:27.873
Washed your hair,

08:27.875 --> 08:29.374
Listened to all those
tall tales

08:29.376 --> 08:31.209
About what was,

08:31.211 --> 08:33.278
What could have been.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.617
I heard those stories...

08:38.619 --> 08:41.286
Ten times over, elsa.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.188
I know you

08:43.190 --> 08:45.257
Better than you know yourself.

08:47.394 --> 08:51.062
I've always wondered why,

08:51.064 --> 08:55.166
When i loved you so much,

08:55.168 --> 08:59.004
It gave me such pain
to be around you.

08:59.006 --> 09:02.874
How when i'd leave here
at night i'd just...

09:02.876 --> 09:05.110
Felt like i lost something.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.014
A woman shouldn't dread...

09:09.016 --> 09:12.317
Spending time
with her best friend.

09:12.319 --> 09:15.687
Why'd i feel so uneasy?

09:15.689 --> 09:17.822
Now i know.

09:21.762 --> 09:22.894
Who am i,

09:22.896 --> 09:26.531
If not your savior, huh?

09:26.533 --> 09:28.833
And this is the thanks.

09:28.835 --> 09:31.169
You call me a murderer

09:31.171 --> 09:34.005
On a night
when i have already lost...

09:34.007 --> 09:36.575
So much?

09:38.111 --> 09:40.078
Damn you for this!

09:40.080 --> 09:42.981
Goddamn you for this!

09:43.917 --> 09:45.984
Damn you!

09:48.455 --> 09:50.589
You were our mother.

09:50.591 --> 09:53.592
There's people around here
who never even met theirs.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.126
You understand...

09:55.128 --> 09:58.964
The pain of being rejected
by your own mother?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.966
Of course you do.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.034
That's how you
sucked us all in here.

10:03.036 --> 10:07.205
Come one, come all,
suckle at elsa's bosom.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.473
All are welcome.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.041
Just don't ask for top billing.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.411
Enough of this.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.047
I have killed no one.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.149
What about the twins?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.718
I stood right there.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.253
I heard you talking
to that fella from hollywood.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.389
Wouldn't it be a better solution
if they could be

10:24.391 --> 10:26.091
Quietly and easily relieved

10:26.093 --> 10:27.659
Of their misery?

10:27.661 --> 10:28.760
What are you saying?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.395
A mercy killing.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.997
Elsa: Oh, that's
quite a solution.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.466
And you, you didn't even blink.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.901
"quite a solution,"

10:36.903 --> 10:38.336
You called it.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.805
I died when i heard you
say that.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.743
You killed me dead.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.083
It was a turn of phrase.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.084
(scoffs)

10:53.086 --> 10:54.285
But i will be judged

10:54.287 --> 10:56.621
On my actions,

10:56.623 --> 10:58.056
And not on my words.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.127
So now i am
going to go out,

11:02.129 --> 11:03.862
I'm going to find
those twins,

11:03.864 --> 11:05.997
I'm going to bring
them back here,

11:05.999 --> 11:08.933
So they can pronounce
my innocence to you

11:08.935 --> 11:10.335
One more time!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.003
No way.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.305
No, i made sure

11:14.307 --> 11:16.007
They were safe somewhere

11:16.009 --> 11:17.342
Away from you.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.210
My, my.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.279
Well, you got me, copper.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.014
Huh? (chuckles)

11:23.016 --> 11:25.016
Guilty as charged.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.187
Yes, i wanted them to be gone.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.057
But i never hurt anyone.

11:32.059 --> 11:35.226
I wanted to be rid of them.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.996
Put them on a bus to tampa.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.733
Although, for me, death would be
preferable to tampa.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.669
And i will no longer suffer

11:44.671 --> 11:48.239
Your insults and your insanity!

11:50.877 --> 11:54.879
Apparently, i have lost
two old friends tonight.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.115
No.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.089
(laughing)

12:04.091 --> 12:06.391
Oh, ethel...

12:06.393 --> 12:11.596
I am just like the rest
of my children.

12:11.598 --> 12:16.367
I love you
because i understand you.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.237
You think you know me, hmm?

12:21.575 --> 12:24.442
You... Don't know me at all.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.080
(speaking german)

12:29.082 --> 12:32.851
<i>A sweet young soldier</i>
<i>with a kind heart found me</i>

12:32.853 --> 12:35.086
<i>And brought me to my safety.</i>

12:35.088 --> 12:37.956
<i>His name was massimo dolcefino.</i>

12:37.958 --> 12:40.925
(speaking german)

12:40.927 --> 12:43.928
<i>He found his fame</i>
<i>in the first world war</i>

12:43.930 --> 12:46.131
<i>When grenades became</i>
<i>the great terror,</i>

12:46.133 --> 12:49.234
<i>Separating soldiers</i>
<i>from their limbs.</i>

12:49.236 --> 12:54.906
<i>With an almost unlimited supply</i>
<i>of clients for his prosthetics,</i>

12:54.908 --> 12:58.543
<i>Massimo elevated</i>
<i>his craft into art.</i>

12:58.545 --> 13:00.578
<i>But after the war,</i>

13:00.580 --> 13:04.315
<i>He fell on hard times.</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:08.787
(groans softly)

13:19.399 --> 13:22.600
(panting)

13:22.602 --> 13:25.136
(speaks quietly
in german)

13:26.840 --> 13:28.006
No.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.012
No.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.581
(speaking german)

13:51.431 --> 13:53.498
<i>Massimo emigrated to germany</i>

13:53.500 --> 13:55.934
<i>To work in the movies</i>

13:55.936 --> 14:00.004
<i>As a sculptor, a prop maker.</i>

14:02.008 --> 14:04.309
<i>And it was there</i>

14:04.311 --> 14:07.612
<i>He met his greatest challenge.</i>

14:07.614 --> 14:10.515
<i>Me.</i>

14:29.035 --> 14:30.969
(laughter echoing)

14:32.239 --> 14:35.373
So now you see.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.909
Why didn't you tell me all this?

14:39.512 --> 14:41.679
Why'd you keep it a secret
from me?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.915
I was humiliated, ashamed.

14:43.917 --> 14:47.585
Can't you see
how deep it is?

14:47.587 --> 14:51.589
Ethel... Put the gun away.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.158
No.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.831
Curtain comes down tonight.

14:59.833 --> 15:03.268
Do you think the others
will cover for your murder?

15:04.504 --> 15:07.305
The last bullet's for me.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.510
You broke my heart in two, elsa.

15:14.014 --> 15:17.115
I loved you.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.684
I gave my life to you.

15:19.686 --> 15:22.186
I defended you.

15:24.090 --> 15:27.091
For me, the only
pure things

15:27.093 --> 15:30.128
In the world was
little ma petite,

15:30.130 --> 15:33.564
And my love and
dedication for you.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.533
Now they're both gone.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.135
And jimmy, your own son?

15:37.137 --> 15:38.803
He'll survive.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.372
I left him a letter.
It's in the caravan.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.409
And the rest
of our children?

15:44.411 --> 15:47.712
Your descent into madness
can cross over my corpse,

15:47.714 --> 15:50.315
But you will not kill
my children.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.150
They are innocents.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.786
It's all over, elsa.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.324
For all of us.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.960
No one's innocent anymore.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.465
So be it.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.867
(laughs)

16:11.104 --> 16:13.504
But first...

16:13.506 --> 16:17.976
One last schnapps
for the road?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.410
Hmm?

16:19.412 --> 16:22.914
A toast to our history.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.356
Go on.

16:41.968 --> 16:45.403
We've never shared a drink
before, have we?

16:51.978 --> 16:54.979
I'm sorry, you won't be going

16:54.981 --> 16:57.148
To hollywood, elsa.
So, you won't be there

16:57.150 --> 16:58.950
With me.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.365
Is she hurt?
Not that
i could see.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.867
That richard spencer
fella found her

17:15.869 --> 17:18.236
Out by the ferris wheel,
blubbering.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.673
(maggie crying)
maggie?

17:22.675 --> 17:24.976
Oh, jimmy!

17:24.978 --> 17:26.644
What? What happened?

17:26.646 --> 17:29.213
That is what we are trying
to determine.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.151
I was out in the woods,

17:33.153 --> 17:36.854
Picking flowers for
ma petite's memorial grave.

17:36.856 --> 17:38.756
(car engine approaching,
crashing)

17:38.758 --> 17:41.159
<i>There was a crash.</i>

17:41.161 --> 17:42.560
<i>I went to see what it was,</i>

17:42.562 --> 17:45.563
<i>And there was a car,</i>
<i>and in the car...</i>

17:45.565 --> 17:48.066
(gasps, screams)

17:48.068 --> 17:50.268
I'm sorry, jimmy.
It was your mother.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.070
She's dead.
Elsa (gasps):
What?

17:52.072 --> 17:55.273
Not ethel. Oh, no,
that can't be.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.942
She was in an accident?

17:57.944 --> 17:59.010
It wasn't an accident.

17:59.012 --> 18:00.912
I think she killed herself.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.114
(people gasping)
shit!

18:03.116 --> 18:05.450
Come on.
Elsa:
Suicide?

18:05.452 --> 18:07.752
Oh, dear, no.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.220
Oh, but why?!

18:09.222 --> 18:11.222
She was sick.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.124
In a lot of
pain, too.

18:13.126 --> 18:16.094
No. My mom wasn't sick.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.062
Dell:
She was, though, son.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.098
No.
She told me so herself.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.766
(crying):
No.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.601
Guess she wanted
to go out on her own terms.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.138
Elsa:
Oh. My god.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.740
Where is she?
Take me to her.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.375
Desiree:
Her head's come off?

18:31.377 --> 18:33.978
Jesus.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.947
How hard did she hit that tree?

18:35.949 --> 18:38.216
(people gasping and exclaiming)

18:39.152 --> 18:40.751
Look!

18:40.753 --> 18:43.054
Oh!
She must have
wrapped this chain

18:43.056 --> 18:44.922
Around that tree, and then
wrapped it around her neck,

18:44.924 --> 18:46.958
Then hit the gas.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.960
I guess she wanted it
to be quick.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.094
Oh!

18:50.096 --> 18:52.430
Oh,<i> mein</i> god in heaven!

18:52.432 --> 18:53.731
Why?!

18:53.733 --> 18:55.433
What do you mean, "why?"

18:55.435 --> 18:58.836
Why can't we just hang her in
her caravan and be done with it?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.938
Because you chucked a knife
through her eye socket.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.607
Oh, god.
That's why.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.142
(groans)

19:04.144 --> 19:06.644
This accident is gonna
cover a whole host of sins,

19:06.646 --> 19:09.981
All of them yours.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.150
Where's your sense
of drama?
This is not theater!

19:12.152 --> 19:13.584
That's exactly what it is.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.753
This is a magic trick.
We have to divert

19:15.755 --> 19:18.689
The attention of the audience in
order to pull off the illusion.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.458
Oh, my god.

19:20.460 --> 19:24.095
No, don't.
My god, what have i done?

19:24.097 --> 19:26.931
(crying):
Oh, ethel.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.599
But you understand.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.168
I had to kill her.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.036
I had to protect
my precious angels.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.604
Horseshit.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.873
You had to
protect yourself.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.642
But you don't...

19:37.644 --> 19:40.044
Why are you doing
this for me, huh?

19:40.046 --> 19:41.979
Tell me, why are you
doing this for me?!

19:41.981 --> 19:45.483
This... This... This is what
we do in hollywood.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.051
You are my client.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.654
I have an obligation
to-to protect you,

19:49.656 --> 19:51.055
Protect your career.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.057
You have a destiny,

19:53.059 --> 19:55.993
Written in the stars,
to be a star.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.996
You're gonna win
an oscar one day.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.898
Do you really think so?

20:00.900 --> 20:03.167
I do. I do.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.102
(engine revving,
elsa whimpers)

20:07.073 --> 20:09.373
(engine revving)

20:09.375 --> 20:11.242
(metallic clang,
chain jangling)

20:14.514 --> 20:16.380
Oh, ethel, why?!

20:16.382 --> 20:18.382
Oh, my sweet sister!

20:18.384 --> 20:20.518
(crying):
Why? Why? Why? Why?

20:20.520 --> 20:24.055
I could have helped you.
I could have helped you.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.523
I could have helped you.

20:25.525 --> 20:28.059
(crying):
Oh, my god.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.994
(sobbing)

20:29.996 --> 20:33.864
Oh, my sweet,
sweet sister.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.200
(crying echoing)

20:36.202 --> 20:39.203
Gloria:
Dandy, where are you, darling?

20:39.205 --> 20:43.107
I have a surprise for you!

20:43.109 --> 20:44.675
Dandy!

20:44.677 --> 20:47.278
Dandy:
Mother, look
who came for a visit.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.782
Hello, mrs. Mott.

20:51.784 --> 20:54.685
I came to see my mother.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.787
Oh, dear, you just missed her.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.091
Regina's been peppering me
with questions all afternoon,

21:00.093 --> 21:03.694
But i told her that you were
the last one to speak to dora.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.197
And only you could
shine a light

21:06.199 --> 21:08.065
On the situation.

21:08.067 --> 21:11.702
Yes, well...

21:11.704 --> 21:14.805
Dora went to buy the squash.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.275
You understand, dear.

21:17.277 --> 21:21.579
These days, the only way
to procure a proper squash

21:21.581 --> 21:25.483
Is to venture down
to homestead, to the klingmans'.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.952
That horrid hurricane
completely destroyed

21:27.954 --> 21:30.388
The tabernathys' farm
in pompano,

21:30.390 --> 21:33.124
And it's been simply impossible
to consume the squash

21:33.126 --> 21:35.259
From that region ever since.

21:35.261 --> 21:39.130
My mother went to buy... Squash?

21:39.132 --> 21:41.932
And since she would be
passing coral gables,

21:41.934 --> 21:44.268
I asked her
to stop off

21:44.270 --> 21:46.103
To collect the
blackamoor candelabras

21:46.105 --> 21:48.072
I had purchased
at auction.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.407
So, you see, child,

21:49.409 --> 21:51.909
I could not
venture to guess

21:51.911 --> 21:53.644
When dora will return
from her expedition.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.350
I'll wait.

22:00.486 --> 22:03.587
Oh. My turn.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.189
(insects trilling)

22:05.191 --> 22:07.692
A flat tire,

22:07.694 --> 22:10.094
A leaky faucet.

22:10.096 --> 22:13.164
My mother could fix anything.

22:16.336 --> 22:20.071
She was famous
for her dirty jokes.

22:25.144 --> 22:28.346
But she was also
a woman of culture.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.981
¶ ¶

22:30.983 --> 22:32.550
¶ that's what i'm
talking about ¶

22:32.552 --> 22:33.884
But she loved poetry.

22:33.886 --> 22:35.986
She used to read it
to me as a kid

22:35.988 --> 22:37.021
When i was going to bed.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.356
¶ ain't it a shame ¶

22:38.358 --> 22:40.458
(crying):
Emily dickinson

22:40.460 --> 22:42.460
Was her favorite.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.995
"i'm nobody.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.997
"who are you?

22:46.999 --> 22:50.468
"are you nobody, too?

22:50.470 --> 22:52.436
"then there's a pair of us.
Don't tell.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.807
(crying):
They'd banish us, you know."

22:56.809 --> 23:00.344
(jimmy crying)

23:00.346 --> 23:03.013
You weren't nobody, ma.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.983
¶ sometimes i wonder, baby ¶

23:05.985 --> 23:07.418
(crying):
I'm sorry.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.886
It's okay, son.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.756
¶ lord, will i ever
get back home? ¶

23:14.427 --> 23:17.061
(crying)
all right.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.430
¶ sometimes i wonder ¶

23:19.432 --> 23:21.265
(crying)

23:21.267 --> 23:24.001
¶ hey, will i ever
get back home? ¶

23:29.041 --> 23:33.110
¶ you know, i've been gone
so long, pretty mama ¶

23:33.112 --> 23:36.347
¶ lord, i don't know
my right way home ¶

23:38.451 --> 23:40.751
All right. Let's
go get a drink.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.991
¶ yeah, now. ¶

23:56.569 --> 23:59.770
That woman
was my friend.

23:59.772 --> 24:03.140
She was
tough, funny.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.144
She didn't need a man to...

24:07.146 --> 24:09.914
Take care of her or her child.

24:09.916 --> 24:13.284
She was a survivor
from the day she was born.

24:13.286 --> 24:16.554
Nobody handed her nothing.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.957
We never had it easy.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.827
None of us.
Especially not us women.

24:22.829 --> 24:25.496
I know you all know
what i'm talking about.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.764
It's true.

24:26.766 --> 24:30.134
Look what my daddy
did to me.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.637
Because i dared
to live my own life.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.239
Love who i wanted.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.341
Suzi:
You think the law

24:37.343 --> 24:38.976
Would have anything
to say about it?

24:38.978 --> 24:41.145
Hell no.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.413
She's his property.

24:42.415 --> 24:44.014
Let me tell you
something, ladies.

24:44.016 --> 24:47.985
That girl,
she's every last one

24:47.987 --> 24:50.087
Of us.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.957
Well, i say no more.
Not in my house!

24:52.959 --> 24:55.626
Any man that
would do that,

24:55.628 --> 24:57.862
He needs to pay.

25:00.366 --> 25:02.433
Who's with me?

25:10.943 --> 25:12.943
I see a man.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.012
With his arms torn off.

25:15.014 --> 25:18.649
His insides are outside
for all the world to see.

25:18.651 --> 25:22.219
And... This one?

25:22.221 --> 25:24.054
Oh, that one's easy.

25:24.056 --> 25:25.823
A man is stabbing
a woman to death.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.625
Her blood is smeared
all over the wall.

25:27.627 --> 25:29.693
It's going to be
a very messy cleanup.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.128
I'm bored.

25:32.398 --> 25:34.498
(grunts)
what's my score?

25:34.500 --> 25:37.234
Mother said you wanted
to test my genius iq.

25:37.236 --> 25:40.004
It'll take more than one
visit to determine that.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.940
I'd like to see you
two times a week.

25:45.978 --> 25:49.680
I've been reading
in<i> national geographic</i>

25:49.682 --> 25:53.083
About the natives
of papua new guinea.

25:53.085 --> 25:56.086
They would go to war
with a neighboring tribe,

25:56.088 --> 25:58.255
And when they conquered them,

25:58.257 --> 26:00.024
The winners would eat

26:00.026 --> 26:02.259
The vanquished tribe's
best warriors,

26:02.261 --> 26:06.063
And then their medicine man,
and then their chief.

26:06.065 --> 26:09.066
Tell me, do you think
it's possible

26:09.068 --> 26:13.103
To take someone's power
by eating their flesh?

26:13.105 --> 26:16.106
Or could you do it just by...

26:16.108 --> 26:19.276
Bathing in their blood?

26:21.881 --> 26:24.114
You lied to me, mother.

26:24.116 --> 26:28.018
Dr. Feinbloom had no interest
in measuring my genius iq.

26:28.020 --> 26:31.088
All he wanted to do
was listen to me talk.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.023
I'm never
going back.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.592
Dandy, you must go back.

26:34.594 --> 26:37.127
Do you think
i'm sick, mother?

26:37.129 --> 26:39.129
Of course not.
You're spirited.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.198
Regina:
That's a laugh.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.100
Where...

26:43.102 --> 26:46.737
Is my mother?
She ain't out buying squash.

26:46.739 --> 26:49.807
I'm sure she'll be home in time
for dinner tomorrow night.

26:50.776 --> 26:52.943
She better be.

26:52.945 --> 26:56.013
Or i'm going to the police.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.919
I'll strike you
a bargain, mother.

27:01.921 --> 27:05.322
I'll go back
to see dr. Feinbloom.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.959
In fact, i'll go
for an entire month.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.661
That's wonderful,
dandy.

27:10.663 --> 27:14.365
All you have to do
is kill regina.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.768
You're a horrible
liar, mother.

27:17.770 --> 27:21.939
She can see through every one
of your stupid stories.

27:21.941 --> 27:26.777
Regina wants to send me
to the electric chair.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.013
And if i go,

27:29.015 --> 27:31.015
I'm bringing you

27:31.017 --> 27:33.417
To sit
on my lap.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.988
Isn't it beautiful?

27:48.367 --> 27:50.601
(birds chirping)

27:50.603 --> 27:53.537
(indistinct chatter)

27:56.275 --> 27:58.876
(coughing)

28:27.073 --> 28:28.972
What do they call you?

28:28.974 --> 28:30.507
Barbara.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.543
Can you switch
the machine back on?

28:32.545 --> 28:34.611
What's the point?
You look miserable.

28:35.881 --> 28:37.681
(whispers):
This place is the worst.

28:37.683 --> 28:39.683
You have a pretty face.

28:39.685 --> 28:42.052
I'm elsa mars. Come.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.520
Barbara:
<i>I'm a park avenue princess.</i>

28:43.522 --> 28:46.056
Upper east side townhouse.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.058
We summer in bedford.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.861
I despise
every minute of it.

28:50.863 --> 28:54.098
Debutante balls,
dressing for dinner.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.533
Do i look
like a debutante?

28:56.535 --> 28:58.736
So they sent
you down here

28:58.738 --> 29:00.704
To reduce?

29:00.706 --> 29:03.073
You should see mother
at thanksgiving dinner.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.342
Every time i take a bite,
she sees red.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.444
Last summer, she started telling
people that i was knocked up

29:07.446 --> 29:08.746
Because it was less shameful

29:08.748 --> 29:11.148
Than me being a big, fat pig.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.418
But i like me this way.

29:15.621 --> 29:18.021
You are a hedonist,

29:18.023 --> 29:21.024
A lover of the
physical world.

29:21.026 --> 29:23.193
But what if i told you...

29:26.098 --> 29:28.031
...That there
is a place

29:28.033 --> 29:32.035
(chuckles)
where every pound

29:32.037 --> 29:35.205
Of that glorious jiggle

29:35.207 --> 29:38.809
Would be cheered and celebrated?
(chuckles)

29:38.811 --> 29:40.144
Hmm?

29:44.049 --> 29:47.151
What do we do
if dell comes back before we do?

29:47.153 --> 29:49.286
Then he'll be next.

29:49.288 --> 29:53.123
This caravan's still
as much mine as it is his.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.392
Hey, who's got the rope?
I do.

29:55.394 --> 29:58.095
Hmm.
(chuckles)

30:01.567 --> 30:03.567
I'll take it from here.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.969
It means a lot
that you want to help.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.704
Truly.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.775
But this isn't your fight.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.443
Honey, you're family.

30:13.445 --> 30:16.180
We take care of our own.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.453
Evie,

30:23.455 --> 30:24.955
Put our soup
on simmer.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.224
Low flame.

30:28.427 --> 30:31.028
Let's go.

30:40.005 --> 30:42.072
(insects trilling)

30:45.945 --> 30:48.245
(dog barking in distance)

31:13.539 --> 31:15.606
¶ ¶

31:20.079 --> 31:22.045
(sighs)

31:22.047 --> 31:24.047
(clatter in distance)

31:24.049 --> 31:27.017
¶ and don't dare call me
daddy again ¶

31:27.019 --> 31:28.652
(creaking)

31:28.654 --> 31:32.322
¶ i just said,
"don't dare call me daddy ¶

31:32.324 --> 31:34.091
¶ da-da-daddy again" ¶

31:34.093 --> 31:38.061
¶ i just said, "don't dare
call me daddy again" ¶

31:41.033 --> 31:43.734
(creaking)

31:45.037 --> 31:49.339
¶ don't dare
call me daddy again... ¶

31:52.578 --> 31:54.578
You.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.681
How'd you get in here?
I changed the locks.

31:57.683 --> 32:00.851
Locks can't stop us.

32:00.853 --> 32:02.386
"us"?

32:02.388 --> 32:03.520
Who came here with you?

32:03.522 --> 32:04.922
My sisters.

32:07.059 --> 32:09.092
(shouts)

32:10.930 --> 32:14.398
(grunting)

32:14.400 --> 32:16.700
Let's beat it.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.370
(footsteps approaching)

32:31.150 --> 32:33.150
I ain't hungry.

32:33.152 --> 32:36.086
Of course.
You're drinking your dinner.

32:36.088 --> 32:39.122
What would your
mother say?
Nothing. She's dead.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.724
(bottle clatters, shatters)

32:40.726 --> 32:42.659
Give me a break, elsa.
I'm in mourning.

32:42.661 --> 32:43.994
You are not

32:43.996 --> 32:45.295
The only one
who has lost someone.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.465
She was my mother!
You had others!

32:48.467 --> 32:50.801
I raised you
as much as she did!

32:50.803 --> 32:53.403
Every woman
in this place

32:53.405 --> 32:55.672
Took turns
caring for you.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.775
I showed you how to hold
an audience and to be a leader,

32:58.777 --> 33:00.777
But clearly i failed
in that department.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.980
You're nothing
but a load of wind.

33:02.982 --> 33:05.349
How could you not come
to the funeral?

33:06.352 --> 33:09.987
I was in miami. Recruiting.

33:09.989 --> 33:12.155
You see her?

33:12.157 --> 33:14.024
This is barbara.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.693
Though i have given her
the stage name

33:16.695 --> 33:19.796
Of ima wiggles.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.431
Come in, dear.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.934
Nice to meet you.

33:23.936 --> 33:26.103
Sit down,
dear.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.038
Eat.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.041
Go on.
Eat up.

33:31.043 --> 33:35.979
You are no good to us
without your figure.

33:35.981 --> 33:40.851
She is named after the
greatest fat lady of all time,

33:40.853 --> 33:44.654
Ima waddler,
all 800 pounds of her.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.057
You see,

33:47.059 --> 33:49.559
That's how it works.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.661
Your mother lives

33:51.663 --> 33:54.431
Because the show
will always go on.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.236
You're late.

33:59.238 --> 34:02.172
This party is over.

34:02.174 --> 34:05.075
I've been telling you this
forever, elsa.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.676
This world is dying,

34:06.678 --> 34:09.379
And all the fat ladies
and lizard girls in the world

34:09.381 --> 34:10.814
Ain't gonna change that.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.816
I am trying to help you!

34:12.818 --> 34:14.484
To help this troupe!
Why can you not see that?

34:14.486 --> 34:17.721
(growls)
no! No. Wait, wait.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.023
Wait.

34:20.025 --> 34:23.427
Look at her.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.362
Such an ample bosom.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.764
What comfort
you can take there

34:27.766 --> 34:30.500
On nights you would
have taken comfort

34:30.502 --> 34:33.036
In your mother's embrace.

34:33.038 --> 34:35.605
You're sick, elsa.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.747
This pot pie is heaven.

34:43.749 --> 34:45.515
Eat up, darling.

34:47.052 --> 34:50.153
There's plenty more
where that came from.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.097
Oh!
(grunts)

35:00.099 --> 35:04.101
Look who ain't dead... Yet.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.936
What's going on?
What do you want?

35:05.938 --> 35:07.137
So many things.

35:07.139 --> 35:10.273
But today,
we gonna settle for

35:10.275 --> 35:11.575
A little payback.

35:11.577 --> 35:12.909
Penny, suzi...

35:12.911 --> 35:14.044
Grab them pillows.

35:14.046 --> 35:17.981
Evie, fetch the tar.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.816
Oh... Oh, god, no...

35:23.122 --> 35:24.421
No, no, no.

35:24.423 --> 35:25.755
(frustrated scream)

35:25.757 --> 35:27.724
(grunts)
god...

35:27.726 --> 35:29.960
No, no, no.
There is no god.

35:29.962 --> 35:32.062
You proof
enough of that.

35:32.064 --> 35:33.597
What you done

35:33.599 --> 35:35.499
To your little girl...

35:35.501 --> 35:37.067
That was chickenshit.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.971
We gonna make sure
you look the part.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.606
And after that,

35:42.608 --> 35:44.574
I'm gonna cut your dick off
with this knife,

35:44.576 --> 35:46.409
And then i'm gonna shoot you
in the head.

35:46.411 --> 35:49.446
After that, we gonna chuck you
in the loxahatchee river,

35:49.448 --> 35:52.249
See if the gators got
any use for what's left!

35:52.251 --> 35:53.250
(laughing)

35:53.252 --> 35:54.951
(grunts)

35:54.953 --> 35:56.253
No!

35:56.255 --> 35:57.521
Please, no!
Penny:
Wait!

35:57.523 --> 36:00.323
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.058
Penny...

36:03.195 --> 36:05.095
Let me.

36:06.431 --> 36:07.964
What...? Penny?

36:07.966 --> 36:08.999
Penny...

36:09.001 --> 36:10.800
No.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.602
Please, i'm sorry, penny.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.004
No!

36:14.006 --> 36:15.105
Penny, baby, i am sorry!

36:15.107 --> 36:16.973
No!
(desiree laughing)

36:16.975 --> 36:18.041
No!

36:18.043 --> 36:19.442
Penny! No!

36:19.444 --> 36:22.445
(screaming)

36:22.447 --> 36:24.514
(distant screaming)

36:25.884 --> 36:27.684
(screaming)

36:32.057 --> 36:35.659
(women squealing, whooping)

36:35.661 --> 36:37.527
(laughing)

36:37.529 --> 36:39.829
Desiree:
Evie, get behind him!

36:39.831 --> 36:41.131
Hold him
steady!

36:41.133 --> 36:42.332
Suzi,

36:42.334 --> 36:44.134
Drop his drawers.

36:44.136 --> 36:45.802
(women laughing)

36:45.804 --> 36:47.137
Maggie:
Stop!

36:49.041 --> 36:51.241
Holy shit.

36:51.243 --> 36:53.977
That's your father, isn't it?

36:53.979 --> 36:56.413
Well, goddamn.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.415
You really are a mind reader.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.083
Get out.

37:00.085 --> 37:02.185
This is freak women only.

37:02.187 --> 37:04.421
And is this what it means
to be a freak woman?

37:04.423 --> 37:06.590
What would you know
about it, anyway?

37:07.593 --> 37:09.426
I know that if you do this,

37:09.428 --> 37:11.094
It will change you.

37:11.096 --> 37:12.829
More even than he changed you.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.432
It will change me.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.033
It will free me.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.168
Maggie:
You'll get caught.

37:18.170 --> 37:20.403
Go to prison or worse.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.072
And what about paul?

37:22.074 --> 37:23.273
He loves you.

37:23.275 --> 37:24.541
And you're gonna
give all that up

37:24.543 --> 37:25.909
For him?

37:25.911 --> 37:27.244
Then he wins!

37:27.246 --> 37:28.545
Look at you.

37:28.547 --> 37:30.580
Pretty little white girl.

37:30.582 --> 37:33.116
You got no idea what it's like,

37:33.118 --> 37:34.551
Always living on the outside,

37:34.553 --> 37:36.086
Looking in through a window,

37:36.088 --> 37:38.188
Seeing all the things
you can never have

37:38.190 --> 37:40.357
Because they say so.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.691
You're right.

37:41.693 --> 37:42.959
I can't really
understand

37:42.961 --> 37:44.294
What it's like for you.

37:44.296 --> 37:47.130
And i do plan to have
all of those things.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.766
But, desiree,
what if you could, too?
Mm-mm.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.935
I've lost my chance.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.704
You don't know what chances
you might have left.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.407
And you never will,
if you do this.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.142
And neither will they.

38:01.380 --> 38:04.214
Penny...

38:16.094 --> 38:17.827
(moans)

38:19.064 --> 38:23.400
I am the astounding lizard girl.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.338
You get to live

38:28.340 --> 38:29.673
Only because i say so.

38:33.245 --> 38:36.980
But you come near me or mine

38:36.982 --> 38:40.350
Ever again...

38:40.352 --> 38:42.852
And i will kill you.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.354
(knife clatters on floor)

38:46.024 --> 38:47.357
Desiree:
Evie...

38:47.359 --> 38:49.759
Take him to the edge of camp

38:49.761 --> 38:51.795
And let him crawl home.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.597
(ripping sound, vince screams)

38:56.435 --> 38:58.268
Yes, doctor.

38:58.270 --> 39:02.172
I booked passage on
the<i> queen mary</i> out of new york.

39:02.174 --> 39:04.474
Open return.

39:04.476 --> 39:08.211
Doctor:
Mrs. Mott, i don't think
this is wise.

39:08.213 --> 39:10.747
I would recommend
temporary commitment.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.650
Oh, goodness, no.

39:13.652 --> 39:16.052
Dandy may seem durable,

39:16.054 --> 39:18.154
But he's actually quite fragile.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.522
Mrs. Mott...

39:19.524 --> 39:22.125
I fear for your safety.

39:24.162 --> 39:26.463
Thank you, doctor.

39:26.465 --> 39:29.299
We won't be needing
your services any longer.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.038
Dandy...

39:35.040 --> 39:36.740
You startled me.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.074
You think i'm
defective?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.643
Unbalanced?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.545
Fragile?

39:42.547 --> 39:45.148
I was only trying
to placate the doctor.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.917
We don't want him getting
proactive about your treatment.

39:47.919 --> 39:51.154
Well, if i am unbalanced,
it's your fault.

39:51.156 --> 39:55.425
Dora told me everything
when i was five.

39:55.427 --> 39:57.994
Your father was wiped out
by the crash of '29,

39:57.996 --> 40:01.164
And you would have done anything
to get back to a home like this.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.166
Even marrying
your second cousin.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.903
I loved your father.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.339
I was born of deadly sin.

40:09.341 --> 40:11.674
You knew what
father had done

40:11.676 --> 40:13.443
To those
little girls.

40:13.445 --> 40:15.879
You knew the risks

40:15.881 --> 40:18.948
Of breeding with your cousin.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.683
You're no better
than the roosevelts.

40:20.685 --> 40:23.086
How dare you say that name
in this house?

40:23.088 --> 40:25.021
I'm not going to europe.

40:25.023 --> 40:27.090
I'm not going anywhere with you.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.428
How can i possibly be
with a woman

40:31.430 --> 40:33.696
Who hates me so much?

40:36.435 --> 40:39.135
No, please, dandy...
(sobs)

40:39.137 --> 40:41.070
This is our
last chance.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.506
Can't you see that
you have a sickness?

40:47.446 --> 40:50.580
Your father wasn't
the love of my life.

40:50.582 --> 40:53.783
You were.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.985
From the second
you came out

40:55.987 --> 40:59.989
And looked at me with
that furrowed brow...

41:02.894 --> 41:05.562
...I loved all of you, dandy.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.366
Even the madness.

41:19.144 --> 41:23.079
But...

41:23.081 --> 41:26.082
I have no more love to give.

41:28.420 --> 41:30.920
You have tapped me out.

41:34.626 --> 41:35.925
You're right,
mother.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.494
I'm sorry

41:37.496 --> 41:39.529
I've caused you so much pain.

41:39.531 --> 41:42.832
It's time for this
madness to end.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.767
No, please, dandy.
Not this way.

41:46.438 --> 41:49.839
I can't go on
if you kill yourself.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.007
Okay.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.458
Oh...

42:08.460 --> 42:10.960
(shuddering inhale)

42:10.962 --> 42:13.263
(sighs)

42:23.041 --> 42:25.642
Maggie:
I thought you would have
sobered up by now.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.145
Why would i want to do that?

42:30.181 --> 42:31.881
Well, for one thing,

42:31.883 --> 42:33.816
You're supposed to be
in charge around here.

42:33.818 --> 42:35.218
Nothing makes sense.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.153
It's not making sense.

42:37.155 --> 42:38.988
The best way to honor ethel

42:38.990 --> 42:41.190
Is to take care
of business here.

42:41.192 --> 42:43.726
So we can leave.

42:43.728 --> 42:46.029
Start our own life.

42:46.031 --> 42:48.932
But you can't do that passed out
behind the ferris wheel

42:48.934 --> 42:52.168
Or wallowing over here.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.270
I mean, do you know
what almost happened last night?

42:54.272 --> 42:55.772
What's wrong with you?

42:57.342 --> 42:59.208
You sound like some
old schoolmarm.

42:59.210 --> 43:02.045
I'm the girl who fell in love
with a leader.

43:02.047 --> 43:03.580
A hero,
for christ sakes!

43:03.582 --> 43:05.682
Where is he?
Well, surprise!

43:05.684 --> 43:08.451
I can't just take my feelings
and roll 'em in a little ball

43:08.453 --> 43:10.086
And stuff 'em back inside!

43:10.088 --> 43:12.255
I'm not
general patton!

43:12.257 --> 43:13.590
Christ!

43:13.592 --> 43:15.191
Is that what
you want?

43:15.193 --> 43:17.794
'cause if that's the case,
then buzz off!

43:19.764 --> 43:22.131
That's not
what i said.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.135
Look...

43:26.137 --> 43:28.471
You need to eat something.

43:31.910 --> 43:33.309
Listen to me, jimmy.

43:33.311 --> 43:35.612
You didn't do
anything wrong.

43:35.614 --> 43:37.413
You're assuming that

43:37.415 --> 43:39.949
You could have saved
your mother, but...

43:39.951 --> 43:42.251
Just let the idea go, baby.

43:42.253 --> 43:44.787
You don't
understand anything.

43:46.558 --> 43:48.157
No.

43:48.159 --> 43:49.592
Give me!

43:49.594 --> 43:50.927
You shouldn't
burden yourself

43:50.929 --> 43:53.463
With the likes of me.

43:53.465 --> 43:54.964
Go have your beautiful life

43:54.966 --> 43:57.033
With someone else.

44:00.105 --> 44:02.105
(sniffs)

44:02.107 --> 44:04.273
All righty, then.

44:04.275 --> 44:06.042
Thanks for the clarity.

44:25.530 --> 44:28.031
You're still here?

44:30.268 --> 44:31.668
I am.

44:55.794 --> 44:58.094
(sobbing)

45:25.090 --> 45:29.158
