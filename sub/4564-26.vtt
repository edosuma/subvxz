WEBVTT

00:02.194 --> 00:05.020
( Screaming )

00:05.055 --> 00:08.373
Okay, Judy, what is wrong?

00:08.408 --> 00:12.018
Someone killed a tree.
I think they strangled it
with lights.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.096
Someone's trying
to send us a message.

00:14.131 --> 00:16.665
Yeah, yeah. And I think
that message is,

00:16.700 --> 00:18.383
"Merry Christmas!"

00:18.419 --> 00:20.401
Christmas trees are a tradition,

00:20.437 --> 00:22.729
like caroling
and hanging stockings.

00:22.764 --> 00:24.489
And don't forget giving gifts.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.483
When it comes to gift giving,

00:26.518 --> 00:28.868
people might say I have a gift.

00:28.904 --> 00:30.696
Yeah, the gift of retelling

00:30.731 --> 00:33.607
that same joke year after year.

00:33.642 --> 00:37.794
Look, okay, if there was,
like, a Christmas
gift-giving Olympics,

00:37.830 --> 00:40.497
I would win the gold,
the silver, and the bronze,

00:40.574 --> 00:42.574
and then I would take
that gold, silver and bronze,

00:42.601 --> 00:44.209
I would rewrap it
and give it away as a gift,

00:44.244 --> 00:45.244
because I am that good.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.064
Watch this.

00:49.099 --> 00:51.233
Hey, Dad, I know
it's Christmas Eve,

00:51.268 --> 00:52.543
but I just could not wait
to give you one of your gifts.

00:52.578 --> 00:54.636
Oh, a KC gift?

00:54.672 --> 00:56.922
Bring it on.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.807
All right, so you know,
Christmas is all about family,

00:58.842 --> 01:00.809
and I think everyone
should be together

01:00.811 --> 01:02.986
at this time of year,
but not everyone is here.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.639
Sure we are.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.791
Maybe for Christmas,
we need to get you
an eye exam.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.467
( Forced laughter )
No.

01:09.502 --> 01:10.777
Okay?

01:10.812 --> 01:12.645
Not everyone is here.

01:12.681 --> 01:16.358
At least, not for another hour,

01:16.393 --> 01:19.328
when Dad's dad Poppa Earl
arrives at the airport!

01:19.330 --> 01:21.638
That's right, score another
perfect gift from KC.

01:21.674 --> 01:27.760
Take that, Santa.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.516
Why aren't you
( angrily )umping up and down
Thanks a lot, KC.anking m

01:30.657 --> 01:32.941
Huh.

01:32.976 --> 01:36.653
Right words, wrong tone.

01:36.688 --> 01:40.031
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

01:40.066 --> 01:43.227
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

01:43.303 --> 01:46.396
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

01:46.431 --> 01:51.284
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

01:51.320 --> 01:54.988
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

01:55.023 --> 01:57.040
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

01:57.076 --> 02:01.194
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

02:01.229 --> 02:05.048
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

02:05.084 --> 02:07.158
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

02:07.193 --> 02:09.436
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

02:09.471 --> 02:11.871
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

02:11.907 --> 02:13.982
¶ But I always got your back ¶

02:14.017 --> 02:15.897
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

02:15.903 --> 02:18.111
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

02:18.146 --> 02:20.747
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

02:20.782 --> 02:21.848
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

02:21.883 --> 02:24.209
I keep it undercover.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.844
I keep it undercover.

02:29.124 --> 02:31.307
Wait, Dad,
why aren't you excited

02:31.342 --> 02:32.834
that your father's
visiting for Christmas?

02:32.869 --> 02:35.787
I don't wanna talk about it.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.657
Mom, why isn't he excited?

02:38.734 --> 02:40.500
Poppa Earl hasn't visited
in, like, three years.

02:40.536 --> 02:42.616
- Well, I guess...
- That's not a coincidence.

02:44.523 --> 02:45.880
So you two are
mad at each other?

02:45.916 --> 02:49.117
I don't wanna talk about it.

02:49.152 --> 02:51.728
- Why didn't I know
that they were in a fight?
- Well, we feel that...

02:51.763 --> 02:53.605
Children shouldn't
be burdened with
this kind of stuff.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.391
Is there any way
you two can make up?

02:56.426 --> 03:00.963
- I have been saying that...
- I don't wanna talk about it!

03:00.998 --> 03:03.790
My father thinks I'm
a very big disappointment,
and I'm tired of it.

03:03.825 --> 03:06.305
And I am tired of not
being able to get in
on this conversation.

03:08.088 --> 03:11.757
Dad, you are a super cool,
high-ranking secret agent.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.825
Who wouldn't be proud of...

03:13.860 --> 03:16.169
Oh, right.

03:16.204 --> 03:17.896
Someone who's not
allowed to know

03:17.931 --> 03:20.615
that you're a super cool,
high-ranking secret agent.

03:20.650 --> 03:22.775
Well, we could tell him,

03:22.811 --> 03:23.985
but then, I'd have to kill him.

03:24.021 --> 03:25.362
Ooh, maybe I should tell him.

03:25.397 --> 03:27.247
Dad!

03:27.282 --> 03:29.349
I'm sorry, but for 20 years,

03:29.384 --> 03:31.034
he's been putting me down,
and it's not right.

03:31.070 --> 03:33.178
A father should respect his son.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.294
- Good news, Dad, I found...
- Not now, Ernie.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.159
But now, thanks to
you and your gift,

03:40.195 --> 03:42.079
I gotta deal with
that man criticizing me

03:42.114 --> 03:44.034
under my own roof,
so thanks a lot

03:44.065 --> 03:45.365
for ruining my Christmas.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.958
How you like
your little gift now?

03:46.993 --> 03:48.718
I don't wanna talk about it.

03:52.490 --> 03:54.282
Hurry up and use
those x-ray eyes.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.558
I wanna see what
some of my gifts are.

03:58.096 --> 04:00.388
Hey!

04:00.424 --> 04:02.832
You know those fancy
headphones you wanted.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.628
- Yeah!
- You didn't get 'em.

04:07.097 --> 04:08.771
But you did get
some brand-new tighty-whities.

04:08.806 --> 04:11.583
Score!

04:11.618 --> 04:14.185
If you ask me,
this whole gift-giving thing

04:14.220 --> 04:16.129
is a big ol' waste
of time and effort.

04:16.164 --> 04:18.156
Don't bother getting
me anything.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.542
But gifts are
the best part of Christmas.

04:20.577 --> 04:22.469
Elves at the North Pole
spend all year making them.

04:22.504 --> 04:25.363
Really? Little elves?

04:25.399 --> 04:27.140
At the North Pole?

04:27.175 --> 04:28.383
Making tighty-whities?

04:32.439 --> 04:34.322
We're home.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.957
Push out the way, boy.

04:35.992 --> 04:38.026
I wanna see my grandkids.

04:38.061 --> 04:39.786
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.446
Ooh-whee, look at you,
my sweet angel.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.532
Poppa Earl.

04:45.276 --> 04:47.344
I bet you have to fight
theYeah, well, sticks... k.

04:47.379 --> 04:48.895
Rocks, nunchucks,
whatever it takes, really.

04:48.930 --> 04:50.664
Ernie.

04:50.699 --> 04:52.290
How the ladies treatin' you?

04:52.325 --> 04:57.187
- About the same.
- Sorry to hear that.

04:57.222 --> 04:59.382
You're a late bloomer,
kinda like your father.

05:00.275 --> 05:02.025
Well, maybe he was
just waiting for

05:02.060 --> 05:03.220
the right girl to come along.

05:05.439 --> 05:09.941
And when you did,
he clung on to you
like grim death.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.802
Oh, now, Earl, let's not
relive your wedding toast.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.781
You got a lot of nerve, Dad.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.716
Not saying hello to
your newest granddaughter.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.719
Judy.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.047
Oh, Princess, I've heard
so much about you.

05:24.082 --> 05:24.940
Aren't you
the cutest little doll?

05:24.975 --> 05:27.909
No, but close.

05:27.944 --> 05:29.978
Real cute, real cute.

05:30.013 --> 05:32.681
Oh, look at that.

05:32.716 --> 05:34.724
I see you quit in
the middle of taking
my bags upstairs

05:34.759 --> 05:36.318
just like you quit
at everything else.

05:36.353 --> 05:39.345
Dad, I'm asking you nicely.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.074
It's the holidays.
Can we please not go there?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.009
What? I didn't say
one word about you

05:44.044 --> 05:46.219
quitting your dream
of going to med school

05:46.296 --> 05:48.672
to become an accountant.
But since you brought it up,

05:48.707 --> 05:50.915
am I wrong for wishing
my son was saving lives
instead of saving pennies?

05:50.951 --> 05:53.434
Dad, I'm begging you.
Please stop talking.

05:53.470 --> 05:55.320
If you don't wanna talk,
why did you invite me
in the first place?

05:55.356 --> 05:56.370
If you must know,
this whole idea came from...

05:56.406 --> 05:58.648
His heart.

05:58.683 --> 06:02.076
The bottom of his heart.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.762
You see, he just kept saying,

06:03.797 --> 06:05.347
"Three Christmases
is way too long

06:05.382 --> 06:07.081
to go without
seeing my daddy."

06:07.117 --> 06:10.418
Look at you two,
reminiscing, having fun.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.753
Yeah, fun.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.371
Yeah, fun.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.631
Lots of fun.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.242
Junior, help me with my bags.

06:21.565 --> 06:23.231
Good thing you're so good
at giving gifts,

06:23.266 --> 06:27.051
or this could've really
been awkward.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.503
Listen here, Afro-puffs.

06:30.748 --> 06:32.348
I am going to turn this
into the best gift

06:32.383 --> 06:35.202
my dad has ever gotten.

06:35.237 --> 06:37.512
I just gotta do it
before they deck
each other's halls.

07:12.082 --> 07:13.890
Merry Christmas!

07:13.925 --> 07:15.809
ALL: Merry Christmas.

07:15.844 --> 07:18.561
A little present
from my parents.

07:18.596 --> 07:21.914
From the Millers to the Coopers.

07:21.950 --> 07:24.301
I don't think I've ever
seen such a beautiful
gingerbread house.

07:24.336 --> 07:27.086
My mom really
appreciates you guys.

07:27.121 --> 07:29.823
She said, sure,
it is a lot of trouble

07:29.858 --> 07:32.342
to make a gingerbread
house from scratch,

07:32.377 --> 07:35.478
but the Coopers
are totally worth it.

07:35.513 --> 07:36.905
Hey, look,
there's a card inside.

07:36.940 --> 07:39.940
No, there's not.

07:39.976 --> 07:41.801
"To the Millers.
We appreciate your business."

07:41.837 --> 07:43.653
Enjoy the gingerbread house.

07:43.688 --> 07:45.697
Merry Christmas
from your friends

07:45.732 --> 07:46.892
"at Shapiro Exterminators."

07:49.903 --> 07:51.644
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.240
I really thought
I threw that card away.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.757
- ( Bracelet chimes )
- It's mission time.

07:56.793 --> 07:57.908
Discreetly get
everyone upstairs.

07:57.944 --> 08:00.353
Oh, sugar.

08:00.388 --> 08:03.189
I forgot to get
those special ornaments

08:03.224 --> 08:05.950
from the attic.
I better go get them.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.652
Um, hey, Dad, I think
you should go help Mom.

08:07.687 --> 08:10.045
I know it's your<i> mission</i>
to be there for her.

08:10.081 --> 08:13.483
Oh, right.

08:13.518 --> 08:15.585
Hey, Ernie, I think
we're out of tinsel.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.245
Do you mind going up
to the attic and
getting some more?

08:17.280 --> 08:20.097
It only be a<i> brief</i> moment.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.600
So get it yourself.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.475
While you're at it,
get some eye drops, Blinky.

08:26.264 --> 08:29.974
But Ernie, it's
a tinsel emergency.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.993
Oh! Tinsel.

08:32.028 --> 08:34.186
I thought you said tonsils.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.064
So I was, like,
we don't keep tonsils...

08:36.099 --> 08:37.674
I'm gonna go upstairs.

08:40.044 --> 08:41.684
You know what, I'm gonna
go help them out.

08:41.712 --> 08:43.271
Marisa, do you mind
keeping my Pops company?

08:43.306 --> 08:44.746
- Sure.
- Thanks.

08:46.009 --> 08:47.925
So you're a doctor, right?

08:47.961 --> 08:50.603
Yes, and I have been
for the past 40 years.

08:50.638 --> 08:53.406
What is the grossest
thing you've ever seen,

08:53.441 --> 08:55.041
and where does this
fall on the spectrum?

08:59.514 --> 09:01.931
So the Organization needs us
for a surveillance mission

09:01.966 --> 09:03.041
at the National Archives
Museum this afternoon.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.318
There's chatter about someone
possibly breaking in

09:05.353 --> 09:07.704
and stealing the Bill of Rights.

09:07.739 --> 09:10.991
( Whining ) What about our right
not to work on Christmas Eve?

09:11.026 --> 09:12.817
Oh, relax,
it's a nothing mission.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.444
We just have to check it out.
We'll be home in an hour.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.438
We don't know that.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.023
I volunteer to do
the mission alone,

09:19.059 --> 09:20.333
even if it takes all week.

09:20.368 --> 09:22.577
But then you won't be able

09:22.612 --> 09:24.412
to spend any time
with Poppa Earl.

09:24.447 --> 09:27.114
Oh, darn,
I didn't think of that.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.833
Oh, well, what can you do?

09:28.868 --> 09:32.437
Dad, your mission
is to stay here

09:32.472 --> 09:35.314
and make fantastic
Christmas memories
with Poppa Earl.

09:35.349 --> 09:36.599
And then, later on,
you're gonna thank me

09:36.634 --> 09:37.914
for giving you
such a great gift.

09:37.944 --> 09:40.770
She's right. You and your dad
need to fix things.

09:40.805 --> 09:42.689
Ernie and I will do the mission.

09:42.724 --> 09:44.866
Craig, you be with your father,

09:44.901 --> 09:47.061
and KC, you make sure
they don't kill each other.

09:49.247 --> 09:51.848
Well, well, well, look here.

09:51.883 --> 09:55.217
I see you forgot to tell me
the party was moved upstairs.

09:55.253 --> 09:58.070
Like you forgot to tell me
you weren't cut out
for medical school.

09:58.106 --> 10:00.165
Yeah, Dad, you mind?

10:00.200 --> 10:00.965
We're having
a little family meeting.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.443
Are you trying to figure out
other ways to ignore me?

10:04.479 --> 10:06.104
If you don't wanna
spend time with me,

10:06.139 --> 10:08.523
why did you invite me?

10:08.600 --> 10:09.799
So we could all spend
time together as a family.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.250
Isn't that nice?

10:11.286 --> 10:12.777
I didn't invite you.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.612
KC did, as a gift to me.

10:14.647 --> 10:17.498
And what a gift it is.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.592
You know what else is a gift?

10:19.628 --> 10:22.711
The gift of music.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.667
¶ On the first day
of Christmas ¶

10:24.691 --> 10:25.832
¶ My true love gave to me ¶

10:25.867 --> 10:27.892
So you never wanted me here?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.986
Uh, everybody now.

10:30.021 --> 10:32.004
¶ A partridge in a pear tree ¶

10:32.040 --> 10:34.023
No, I did not.

10:34.058 --> 10:35.875
¶ On the second day
of Christmas ¶

10:35.911 --> 10:38.053
¶ My true love gave to me ¶

10:38.129 --> 10:39.871
Don't worry, because
this gift is being returned

10:39.906 --> 10:41.806
to its home in Atlanta.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.750
¶ Two turtle doves ¶

10:43.785 --> 10:46.145
Or to his home in the Caribbean,

10:46.154 --> 10:49.447
because I have two homes
because I am a doctor.

10:49.483 --> 10:53.868
¶ And a partridge
in a pear tree ¶

10:53.903 --> 10:56.421
I only have one home,
and you're no longer
welcome in it.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.689
That's fine, 'cause
I'm getting my bag

10:58.724 --> 11:00.564
and getting on
the next flight outta here.

11:01.745 --> 11:05.413
¶ On the third day
of Christmas ¶

11:05.448 --> 11:07.807
¶ My daughter gave to me ¶

11:07.842 --> 11:11.786
¶ The worst gift
I ever received ¶

11:14.391 --> 11:16.082
It's French hens.

11:18.586 --> 11:20.545
Three... French hens.

11:26.128 --> 11:28.561
- ( Whistling )
- You hear that?

11:28.638 --> 11:31.506
That's the sweet sound
of nobody criticizing me.

11:31.541 --> 11:33.466
So Merry Christmas to all,

11:33.501 --> 11:37.645
and to all,
a "leave me alone."

11:37.680 --> 11:40.648
I cannot believe you let
your father just walk out.

11:40.683 --> 11:43.359
Oh, I have a feeling
he'll be walking right back in.

11:43.395 --> 11:45.036
I wouldn't count on it.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.511
The Cooper men are stubborn.

11:48.265 --> 11:50.208
Earl?

11:50.243 --> 11:52.085
I couldn't get on a flight.

11:52.162 --> 11:54.829
The airline said I'm on
some kind of no-fly list.

11:54.864 --> 11:58.441
Probably annoyed the airline
the way you annoyed me.

11:58.476 --> 12:00.543
This whole thing
is making no sense.

12:00.578 --> 12:02.278
I wasn't on a darn list
when I flew in this morning.

12:02.314 --> 12:05.231
Hm. That is weird.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.016
I'm sure you'll be off
that no-fly list

12:07.051 --> 12:09.051
in time for
your original flight home.

12:09.086 --> 12:11.670
- Right, Ernie?
- Oh, I can guarantee it.

12:11.706 --> 12:14.056
Well, aren't you just
Santa's little helper?

12:16.311 --> 12:19.028
- ( Bracelet chimes )
- What was that?

12:19.064 --> 12:21.944
It's just a reminder that
I need to go to the store.
Let's go, Ernie.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.651
I might as well unpack
the gifts I brought.

12:25.686 --> 12:27.403
I've got the cutest
little gift for Judy.

12:27.439 --> 12:29.880
Dad, Judy doesn't need presents.

12:29.916 --> 12:30.681
What child doesn't need
a present on Christmas?

12:30.717 --> 12:33.034
Oh, let me guess.

12:33.069 --> 12:35.528
You were in the car, you were
about to get her toys,

12:35.563 --> 12:37.297
and then you decided to...

12:37.332 --> 12:39.190
Don't you say it.
Don't you dare say it.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.700
Okay, I won't say anything.

12:41.736 --> 12:44.103
Look at that.
Look at you two communicating.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.946
You know what, that is
the first step

12:45.982 --> 12:48.691
to getting along,

12:48.727 --> 12:50.593
and<i> that</i> is the true
spirit of Christmas.

12:50.628 --> 12:53.237
( Phone chimes )

12:53.273 --> 12:56.949
"Quit." He texted me
"Quit."

12:56.985 --> 13:00.628
( laughs )
Yeah, but I didn't say it.

13:00.663 --> 13:03.181
You know what?
I'm going to say it.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.041
You guys need to <i>quit</i> arguing.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.902
It is Christmas, okay?

13:07.937 --> 13:10.187
So what you're gonna do
is you're gonna get
your jackets,

13:10.222 --> 13:12.857
you're gonna put
a smile on your face
whether you like it or not,

13:12.893 --> 13:14.225
and we're gonna
go to the mall
and get Judy a present.

13:14.260 --> 13:16.310
- I'm not goin'
to the mall.
- Now!

13:16.346 --> 13:18.704
Move it.
Thank you.

13:18.739 --> 13:22.166
Man, this has gotta be
the worst gift I've ever given.

13:26.289 --> 13:28.540
I don't get it.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.324
If you want
to decorate something,

13:30.360 --> 13:31.360
why not yourself?

13:36.699 --> 13:38.459
Merry Christmas, everyone.

13:40.661 --> 13:42.581
Yeah, I still don't get
this holiday.

13:44.741 --> 13:45.981
( Knocking on door )

13:49.445 --> 13:53.514
¶ Si-i-lent night ¶

13:53.549 --> 13:54.949
It was until you got here.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.411
( Knocking )

14:00.548 --> 14:03.524
¶ Ho-o-ly night ¶

14:03.560 --> 14:05.251
What are you doing?

14:05.286 --> 14:07.419
I'm caroling.

14:07.455 --> 14:08.996
I'm spreading Christmas cheer.

14:09.032 --> 14:11.949
Well, go spread it
next door at the Goldfeders.

14:11.984 --> 14:13.826
They're Jewish.
They don't celebrate Christmas.

14:13.861 --> 14:16.462
- Why not?
- It's not a part
of Judaism.

14:16.497 --> 14:20.791
I'm sorry, did you say
Judy-ism?

14:20.827 --> 14:23.761
Come on in, girl.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.036
Tell me more about
this Judy-ism.

14:30.795 --> 14:34.722
( Horns honking )

14:34.757 --> 14:36.449
You know we wouldn't
be stuck in all this traffic

14:36.484 --> 14:39.535
if someone had put
a little more thought
into his life's choices.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.616
Wow! Just when I think
you can't make everything

14:44.651 --> 14:46.425
about me not going
to med school,

14:46.460 --> 14:48.494
you come up with
a gem like that.

14:48.529 --> 14:50.046
It's a Christmas miracle.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.509
What I think my dad is trying
to say here, Poppa Earl,

14:55.545 --> 14:57.503
is that there are other careers,

14:57.538 --> 14:59.455
careers that help people
every day.

14:59.490 --> 15:02.157
My son's a real help,
filing taxes.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.651
You know they have
computer software

15:03.686 --> 15:05.737
that does that for free.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.680
Look, I think what
Poppa Earl is trying to say...

15:07.716 --> 15:10.491
Let me tell you something.
I am not just an accountant.

15:10.526 --> 15:11.709
I do way more than that.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.202
The truth is, I'm...

15:13.237 --> 15:17.239
Also someone who creates

15:17.275 --> 15:21.060
limited liability corporations.

15:21.095 --> 15:24.672
And that is super cool.

15:24.708 --> 15:26.574
Right, Dad?

15:26.609 --> 15:29.227
Right.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.861
( Cell phone rings )

15:30.897 --> 15:33.172
What's up, Ernie?

15:33.207 --> 15:34.907
<i>Hey, Dad,
Mom could use your help.</i>

15:34.942 --> 15:39.270
<i>This thing has turned into
an accounting emergency.</i>

15:39.305 --> 15:41.481
An accounting emergency?

15:41.516 --> 15:45.075
What, somebody forgot
to carry a one?

15:45.111 --> 15:48.070
Sounds like a real
life-death situation to me.

15:48.105 --> 15:50.623
Sit tight, Ernie.
We'll be right there.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.908
( Tires screeching )

15:52.943 --> 15:54.602
Where you going, fool?

15:54.637 --> 15:55.970
The mall's the other way.

15:56.005 --> 15:58.706
What I think
Poppa Earl means is...

15:58.741 --> 16:00.725
Dang, Dad, did you quit

16:00.760 --> 16:02.760
in the middle of
driving school, too?

16:12.071 --> 16:14.071
What kind of errand takes place

16:14.106 --> 16:16.340
in the back of
the National Archives Museum?

16:16.375 --> 16:18.142
- I can't tell you.
- Because it's
a Christmas surprise.

16:18.177 --> 16:19.093
Just stay in the car.

16:19.128 --> 16:20.536
Stay in the car?

16:20.572 --> 16:22.513
Like I'm a puppy?

16:22.548 --> 16:24.682
Don't be silly.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.134
We would never leave
a puppy in the car.

16:27.170 --> 16:29.170
Now crack the window.
We'll be back soon.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.869
Thank goodness you're here.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.571
Mom saw two enemy agents
breaking into the Archives,

16:46.606 --> 16:48.397
but they overpowered her.

16:48.432 --> 16:49.815
Now they have her
tied behind that dumpster.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.609
- I'll go left.
- I'll flank right.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.310
- What do I do?
- Stay here and hide.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.146
I was hoping you'd say that.

17:07.977 --> 17:10.102
- What is going on?
- Poppa, get back.

17:17.486 --> 17:19.446
- Dad, I'm hit.
- KC, I'm coming, baby.

17:23.726 --> 17:26.160
What the heck kind of
accountant are you?!

17:33.269 --> 17:35.349
Craig, why are these people
shooting at you?

17:35.363 --> 17:37.938
Are they clients
that got audited?

17:37.974 --> 17:40.241
Dad, I'm not an accountant.

17:40.276 --> 17:42.236
- What?
- I'm actually
a secret government spy.

17:42.244 --> 17:44.737
What?

17:44.772 --> 17:46.297
The whole family is.

17:46.332 --> 17:48.882
What?!

17:48.918 --> 17:50.943
Dad, we do not have time
to talk about that right now.

17:50.978 --> 17:52.411
You need to rescue Mom,
and Poppa Earl,

17:52.446 --> 17:55.506
we know you're a doctor 'cause
you mentioned it 472 times,

17:55.541 --> 17:57.316
so do you mind
taking a look at this, please?

17:57.352 --> 18:00.002
Oh, my, my, my, my, my.

18:00.038 --> 18:03.280
Ooh, that's nastier
than Marisa's elbow.

18:27.123 --> 18:29.243
Whoo! Now that's how
you take out the trash.

18:30.785 --> 18:33.277
Hilarious, Craig.

18:33.312 --> 18:34.312
You wanna untie me now?

18:37.033 --> 18:38.732
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

18:38.767 --> 18:41.902
- KC, are you okay?
- Yeah, no, I'm good.

18:41.938 --> 18:44.113
Poppa Earl fixed me up.

18:44.148 --> 18:45.347
Good thing they didn't
hit me in the arm,

18:45.382 --> 18:47.115
'cause I unwrap
presents with it.

18:47.151 --> 18:49.535
Son, I don't know what to say.

18:49.570 --> 18:51.636
What with the kickin'
and the shootin',

18:51.672 --> 18:53.481
and the "hah"
and the "yah."

18:53.516 --> 18:56.350
This whole thing is just
hard for me to process.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.751
Maybe y'all can fill me in
at the mall gettin' Judy's gift.

18:57.787 --> 19:01.038
Uh, Dad, Judy is a robot.

19:01.073 --> 19:02.339
A robot?

19:06.245 --> 19:08.165
These two kids
are normal, right?

19:13.352 --> 19:16.345
So all this time,
you been busy saving the world.

19:16.381 --> 19:18.990
Well, I wouldn't exactly
say we're saving the world.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.150
Now, KC, Poppa's talking.
Don't interrupt.

19:23.612 --> 19:26.113
You were saying, Daddy.

19:26.148 --> 19:29.666
I just feel awful,
the way I've
been treating you.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.252
I should've been praising you
instead of putting you down.

19:31.287 --> 19:35.189
Go on, keep talking.
You got my attention.

19:35.224 --> 19:38.342
What I'm really
trying to say is,

19:38.377 --> 19:41.253
I'm really proud of you, son.

19:51.073 --> 19:55.125
Honey, I think it's time
for the memory spray.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.244
I know, I know.
Just one more second.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.239
So would you say
you were very impressed,

20:00.316 --> 20:02.908
or incredibly impressed
when you saw me rescue Kira?

20:02.943 --> 20:05.277
Man, when I saw you...

20:09.784 --> 20:12.309
Really, Mom?

20:12.344 --> 20:14.264
You couldn't let the guy
get one more compliment?

20:14.271 --> 20:16.191
Sorry, but I got
a turkey to cook.

20:18.108 --> 20:20.167
Come on.

20:20.203 --> 20:22.002
"You're my favorite son, Craig.

20:22.038 --> 20:23.896
You're a chip
off the old block."

20:23.931 --> 20:26.357
I love you, too, Pop.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.301
- Uh, Dad?
- Huh?

20:29.336 --> 20:31.587
I believe you have
something to say to me.

20:31.622 --> 20:34.239
Oh, right.
Merry Christmas, baby.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.408
That's not really
what I was thinking.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.228
Oh, yeah.

20:39.263 --> 20:40.445
Happy New Year.

20:40.481 --> 20:44.008
No.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.193
I was thinking something
more along the lines of,

20:46.229 --> 20:48.120
- "Thank you, KC."
- For what?

20:48.155 --> 20:51.273
- Dad...
- I'm just teasing you.

20:51.309 --> 20:53.075
You know it was
the best Christmas gift ever.

20:53.110 --> 20:56.052
Thank you, KC.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.039
Please.
No thanks necessary.

21:09.626 --> 21:12.244
I don't know how I overslept
on Christmas morning.

21:12.279 --> 21:15.431
I don't even remember
going to bed.

21:15.466 --> 21:18.199
Looks like someone had
too much eggnog last night.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.955
- Where's my present?
- Oh.

21:21.998 --> 21:24.264
Oh, look at that.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.442
It's just the gift that
keeps on re-giving.

21:26.477 --> 21:29.928
Tighty-whities.

21:29.963 --> 21:31.530
Dig a little deeper
in the box, Ernie.

21:34.410 --> 21:38.520
Noise-cancellation
super bass headphones!

21:38.555 --> 21:40.515
I don't know
how those elves do it.

21:43.435 --> 21:46.661
So, Craig, are you gonna
open a gift,

21:46.697 --> 21:48.697
or are you just gonna
quit in the middle?

21:50.084 --> 21:51.342
I love you, Dad.

21:53.337 --> 21:55.137
Here, Dad.
Open this one.

22:00.010 --> 22:01.685
Wow.

22:04.340 --> 22:07.265
I gotta say,
you outdid yourself.

22:07.301 --> 22:09.117
You do give the best
Christmas gifts ever.

22:09.152 --> 22:11.311
Well, you're my father.

22:11.347 --> 22:13.427
I don't wanna argue with you
on Christmas.

Well, this gift
is for Judy from me.

22:17.820 --> 22:19.661
No, thank you.

22:19.696 --> 22:21.513
Why wouldn't you want
a Christmas gift?

22:21.549 --> 22:23.582
Didn't I mention?
I don't celebrate Christmas.

22:23.617 --> 22:25.284
I'm Judy-ish.

22:25.319 --> 22:27.044
Oy vey.

22:30.632 --> 22:33.016
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
