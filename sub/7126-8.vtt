I'll probably just eat him.

<i>So okay: baby steps,</i>

20:08.375 --> 20:10.458

20:10.458 --> 20:12.625
<i>not everything is always in your grasp.</i>

20:12.625 --> 20:15.000
<i>That doesn't mean</i>

20:15.000 --> 20:18.500
<i>It's definitely better</i>

20:18.500 --> 20:21.166
- Get you up there, buddy.
- Mommy. Stranger.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.583
No, no, I was just helping with the--

20:21.333 --> 20:25.333
No touching.

[EXHALES]

20:31.041 --> 20:32.834
Am I a better person than I was before?

20:32.834 --> 20:35.709
Oh, please.
You're so disgustingly good,

20:35.709 --> 20:37.875
I'm surprised you don't live
with seven dwarves.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.750
- Really?
- I'd even let you babysit my dogs,

20:39.750 --> 20:42.417
and that's the biggest compliment
I can give anybody.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.583
Thank you, Dena.
That means a lot to me.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.208
- So would you?
- Would I what?

20:47.208 --> 20:50.041
Babysit my dogs? Because my therapist
wants Chase and I

20:50.041 --> 20:52.166
to go away for a couple of days
without them.

Okay.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.875
Look at this. Look at this. It worked.

20:56.875 --> 20:58.375
Tony's finally calling me.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.291
What are you waiting for?
Will you answer the phone?

21:01.291 --> 21:02.875
You think I should?

21:02.875 --> 21:04.709
- Definitely.
- Yes.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.959
You guys know nothing about men.

21:06.959 --> 21:08.417
Yes.

SAM: <i>Okay, so I couldn't make it work</i>

21:11.542 --> 21:13.709

21:13.709 --> 21:18.542

21:18.542 --> 21:20.041
<i>I think not.</i>
