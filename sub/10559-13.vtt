00:48.080 --> 00:49.274
It's all right, dear.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.118
- Whereabouts?
- Upstairs.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.631
- Oh, morning, Higgins.
- George.

01:03.080 --> 01:04.433
What have we...

01:04.760 --> 01:06.478
Sweet mother of...

01:07.000 --> 01:08.513
Is that a turtle costume?

01:08.600 --> 01:09.828
His name's Randolph Littlefair.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.273
He was a guest
of the Reda family last night.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.078
They had a costume party here.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.958
Has Detective Murdoch been notified?

01:15.040 --> 01:17.395
No. I telephoned his boarding house
and got no answer.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.754
Well, that's odd.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.874
Well, Henry, perhaps you'd best help
with the interviews.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.592
George, I just found Detective Murdoch.

01:40.680 --> 01:41.795
What?

01:52.400 --> 01:53.549
Sir?

01:56.160 --> 01:57.639
- Sir!
- Huh?

01:58.640 --> 01:59.755
What?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.070
- George...
- Sir.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.390
There's been a murder in the next room.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.559
What are you doing here?

02:09.160 --> 02:11.594
Are you all right?
Why are you dressed like that?

02:15.960 --> 02:18.474
George, did you say
someone's been murdered?

02:18.560 --> 02:21.199
Yes, sir, a Mr Littlefair.
He's been beaten to death.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.953
Just through here.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.509
No sign of the rest of it so far, sir.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.070
Perhaps the killer used
the mallet until it broke

02:36.160 --> 02:38.390
and then finished him off
using this clock.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.318
William! Are you all right?

02:41.560 --> 02:44.996
I'm not sure. I believe
I'm still experiencing the effects.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.593
More than eight hours later?

02:46.720 --> 02:49.837
- The effects of what?
- Something I drank last night, George.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.798
- Oh, my! It's the Mock Turtle.
- Yes.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.639
The Mock Turtle.

02:55.280 --> 02:57.555
Dr Ogden and I were attending
a party last night

02:57.640 --> 02:59.915
in honour of the late Lewis Carroll.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.632
<i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
I was the Mad Hatter.</i>

03:04.160 --> 03:05.309
Ah.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.149
Lividity suggests he died
roughly eight hours ago.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.875
I'd say 11:35 to be precise, Doctor.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.078
Which means Mr Littlefair died
while we were all here.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.315
Sir.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.635
I believe this is the handle
to the croquet mallet.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.598
Very good, Henry. Where did you find it?

03:22.680 --> 03:25.035
Sir, it was under the bed
you were sleeping in.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.628
How did part of the murder weapon get
under your bed?

03:34.720 --> 03:38.190
Oh, and why were you sleeping there
in the first place?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.038
It's a long story, sir.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.399
Bad news, I'm afraid, sirs.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.313
There were only two sets of fingerprints
on the mallet, the victim's...

03:45.400 --> 03:46.879
And the other set was mine.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.474
Bloody hell.
Someone's trying to pin this on you.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.238
That would appear to be the case, sir.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.276
Well, we'll get to the bottom of it.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.120
I can't be
a part of this investigation, sir.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.158
In fact, we should get someone
from outside the station.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.758
In the meantime, it would appear we have
our prime suspect in this murder case.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.189
Me.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.353
Giles. Why Giles?

04:11.400 --> 04:14.597
Yes. No, I understand. Yes, sir.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.313
Chief Constable Stockton is sending

04:18.399 --> 04:20.516
Inspector Giles
from Stationhouse Number Three.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.480
He's to have complete authority
over the investigation.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.315
I suppose there are worse fates, sir.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.834
Inspector Giles is
a thorough investigator.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.951
Thorough? He's like you, Murdoch.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.952
Once he sets his sights on a suspect,
that's usually the end of them.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.876
I'm sure you're overstating
the case, sir.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.473
Well, we'll see, won't we?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.633
How are you feeling, William?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.592
Somewhat more like myself.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.992
It goes to my theory.
I think you were drugged.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.750
I'd like to take
a blood sample to prove it.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.068
I would appreciate that.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.869
But with your wedding so close, I'm sure
you have more pressing concerns.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.320
More pressing than clearing you
of a possible murder charge?

04:58.400 --> 04:59.549
I think not.

05:05.240 --> 05:08.357
Doctor, did you come
into my room last night?

05:09.200 --> 05:12.431
I looked in on you at about 11:00,
but I didn't enter the room.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.476
That must be it, then.
I seem to remember someone...

05:17.640 --> 05:18.868
Did you speak to me?

05:19.400 --> 05:20.469
No.

05:20.960 --> 05:24.589
Sir, we found this
tucked into your hatband.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.029
It's the poem.
What was it doing in your hatband?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.314
It's written in reverse writing.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.994
I had to use a mirror to read it
and I still can't make any sense of it.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.152
Murdoch, Dr Ogden,
I believe you know Inspector Giles.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.872
Doctor, Detective.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.757
Well, I'm done here.
If you'll excuse me.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.478
Actually, Doctor,
I would appreciate a word.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.275
I understand you were also
at the Reda house last night.

05:45.760 --> 05:46.909
Yes, I was.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.399
Then, as a material witness, I would ask

05:48.480 --> 05:50.789
that you refrain from communicating
with the suspect.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.150
- Is that really necessary?
- Yes, it is.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.353
When you're ready, Detective.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.478
I conduct all my interviews in private,
Inspector, without exception.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.959
You're under my roof, Giles.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.669
Well, if you like, I could move the
interview to Stationhouse Number Three.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.118
Fine. But this is a waste of time.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.838
If you please, Inspector.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.953
Shall I start at the beginning?

06:32.200 --> 06:33.918
Let's start with the facts.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.870
Time of death has been established
as 11:35 pm. Where were you then?

06:38.920 --> 06:40.831
Sleeping in the room next door.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.831
You'd been invited to spend the night?

06:43.560 --> 06:44.675
No.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.478
I wasn't feeling well.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.074
And where was Mr Littlefair
when you last saw him?

06:50.520 --> 06:53.398
He was on the floor in the parlour.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.952
At least, I think so.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.992
It may have been a hallucination.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.669
Hallucination?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.196
Dr Ogden believes
I was drugged at some point.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.034
And who gave this drug to you?

07:08.360 --> 07:09.554
I don't know.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.952
They were coming around
with trays of drinks all evening.

07:13.360 --> 07:15.510
The frog footmen, that is.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.479
Frog footmen?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.558
I'll tell you what, Detective.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.158
Why don't you start from the beginning?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.149
Yes.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.357
<i>I received an invitation ten days ago.</i>

07:31.680 --> 07:33.113
Ah, thank you.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.598
"Mr and Mrs Jack and Alexandra Reda
request your presence as the Mad Hatter

07:46.680 --> 07:50.116
"at a costume party to be held
in honour of the late Lewis Carroll".

07:50.600 --> 07:52.716
How wonderful,
you get to be the Mad Hatter.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.839
Darcy was supposed to be the Hatter,

07:54.920 --> 07:57.309
but he'll be in Buffalo
visiting his family that night.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.391
Oh, you'll be attending as well?

07:59.480 --> 08:00.833
I'm to be Alice.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.672
I'm going as the White Rabbit.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.039
How did they get my name?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.678
Oh, that was my doing.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.955
I said you were the most
interesting conversationalist and...

08:10.040 --> 08:11.996
That's very flattering, Miss Ogden,
but...

08:12.080 --> 08:15.231
Oh, you have to go.
They'll have no Mad Hatter if you don't.

08:16.280 --> 08:18.840
I'm not much
for wearing costumes.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.718
What costume?
It's a top hat and a bowtie.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.915
Polka dot bowtie.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.354
Do come, William. It'll be fun.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.871
<i>Did you know anyone at the party?</i>

08:33.960 --> 08:36.554
<i>No.
I don't travel in those circles.</i>

08:36.640 --> 08:39.200
<i>So this was the first time you met
Randolph Littlefair?</i>

08:39.320 --> 08:40.548
<i>That's correct.</i>

08:42.559 --> 08:44.039
I feel ridiculous.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.351
Trust me when I tell you you'll be
the least ridiculous person here.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.274
A frog footman, how perfect!

08:50.960 --> 08:52.996
Julia! Ruby!

08:55.920 --> 08:58.673
Oh, how good to see you!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.912
And you must be Mr Murdoch.
I've heard so much about you.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.396
Jack Reda. Glad you could come.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.515
It's a pleasure.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.669
So are we playing croquet?

09:06.760 --> 09:09.399
You can't have a Wonderland party
without croquet.

09:14.680 --> 09:15.749
How lovely.

09:16.920 --> 09:21.596
Julia, Ruby Ogden,
this is our friend Constance Gardner

09:21.680 --> 09:23.352
and this is our son Bradley.

09:23.440 --> 09:25.749
This whole party was Constance's idea.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.269
Such a pleasure.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.272
Oh, and this is Mr Murdoch,
who so graciously agreed

09:30.360 --> 09:32.316
to take Mr Garland's place.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.750
Well, let me introduce you all
to our guests of honour this evening,

09:35.840 --> 09:39.150
Mr Randolph Littlefair
and his lovely wife Eleanor.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.234
Pleased to meet you.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.914
Say hello to Tweedledum
and Tweedledumber here.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.948
Ha! I believe he's mocking you.

09:47.040 --> 09:48.519
I believe he's mocking you!

09:49.040 --> 09:50.553
I am the Mock Turtle.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.758
Oh, I love it
when people get into character!

09:54.200 --> 09:55.599
Off with his head!

09:56.720 --> 09:58.438
Here, your turn.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.759
- Everyone, have fun.
- How delightful!

10:06.000 --> 10:08.912
<i>So that's how your finger marks
got onto the red mallet?</i>

10:10.000 --> 10:11.115
<i>Yes.</i>

10:13.520 --> 10:15.556
What was your impression
of Mr Littlefair?

10:16.960 --> 10:20.032
- I found him overbearing.
- You didn't like him.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.392
I'm not in the habit of killing
people I don't like, Mr Giles.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.035
Fair enough.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.953
And what happened next?

10:30.120 --> 10:31.872
<i>After that, we went inside.</i>

10:35.000 --> 10:36.956
"Drink me". How delightful.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.989
No, thank you.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.276
Come on, Detective,
one drink won't kill you.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.316
It's a Wonderland party, after all.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.115
All right.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.997
<i>Was your drink ever out of your sight?</i>

10:47.920 --> 10:49.035
I don't remember.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.188
So someone could have
slipped the drug in at any time?

10:52.960 --> 10:53.995
Possibly.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.198
Do you think you were
specifically chosen to receive the drug?

10:57.960 --> 11:00.155
I can't think of a reason
why that would be.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.719
Tell me more about Littlefair.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.993
<i>Frankly, I wasn't the only person
who found him objectionable.</i>

11:07.040 --> 11:09.110
You don't belong
with these people, do you?

11:09.480 --> 11:10.708
I'm sorry?

11:11.440 --> 11:13.078
I don't belong with them, either.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.831
Aren't you the hosts' son?

11:16.600 --> 11:18.113
I'm a Communist.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.113
I'm intellectually committed
to loathing them all.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.353
Especially Littlefair.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.074
Why him?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.958
Because my father,
also a despicable capitalist,

11:28.040 --> 11:30.554
is in debt to him
and he's taken full advantage.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.996
And he's an ignorant boor.
He's never read Lewis Carroll.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.992
The Mock Turtle is supposed to be
doleful, not mocking.

11:37.560 --> 11:38.754
The fool.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.600
And what did you make
of Bradley Reda's diatribe?

11:42.680 --> 11:44.238
The disquiet of youth.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.195
The passive intellectual variety.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.316
I'm told there was
some sort of parlour game.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.591
Yes, a word game.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.080
May I have your attention,
please, everyone?

11:55.200 --> 11:59.716
As we all know, Lewis Carroll enjoyed
inventing his own nonsense words.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.630
You'll be asked to invent
a nonsense word of your own

12:03.720 --> 12:06.029
describing the person
standing next to you.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.991
Then we'll put all the words into a hat
and invent a nonsense poem of our own.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.472
<i>And what was this poem about?</i>

12:20.600 --> 12:22.192
I'm not sure, exactly.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.431
That's when the drugs
started to take effect.

12:34.480 --> 12:38.678
Oh, oh, wonderful! Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

12:38.760 --> 12:40.318
We have our poem!

12:41.880 --> 12:45.077
I need to use a mirror
because it's written backwards, so...

12:45.680 --> 12:48.592
"Twas twilly, and the grumbly snifters

12:48.680 --> 12:51.433
"burbled in their moonly sned".

12:52.680 --> 12:55.433
"While the brilleautiful Noomava

12:55.520 --> 12:57.476
"lay smumfy in her bed".

12:58.400 --> 12:59.515
Julia.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.470
- What is it, William?
- I'm having the oddest sensation.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.194
Are you tipsy?

13:06.280 --> 13:10.159
No. Everything seems distorted.

13:10.960 --> 13:16.592
"Gone, he was, and so it was
the ophenfat came sneeling".

13:16.680 --> 13:18.318
Splendid, splendid!

13:18.440 --> 13:21.352
It's the maiden who slays the ogre.
Isn't that refreshing?

13:21.440 --> 13:24.591
Yes, and to think we made it up
all by ourselves.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.317
<i>From that point on,
the distortions grew more intense.</i>

13:29.440 --> 13:31.032
May I offer you another drink?

13:31.240 --> 13:32.958
How delightful.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.918
<i>Time no longer made sense.</i>

13:39.440 --> 13:40.634
Who am I?

13:44.480 --> 13:45.674
I have half a mind to...

13:45.760 --> 13:46.909
You hit him.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.354
I honestly don't know,
but I suspect I did.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.628
And what happened then?

13:54.560 --> 13:56.551
I believe I was helped up to bed.

13:59.560 --> 14:03.599
Ah, look. A smumfy room just for you.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.434
All right.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.555
Huh?

14:16.160 --> 14:17.275
Huh?

14:19.720 --> 14:20.755
Aah!

14:31.600 --> 14:32.635
Well?

14:32.720 --> 14:35.792
The murder weapon was in his room
with his finger marks, he has no alibi.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.075
- He has no motive!
- He had an altercation with the victim.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.195
Bloody hell, man.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.554
Inspector, I'd like to be
able to tell you

14:40.640 --> 14:43.313
that I don't believe
Detective Murdoch killed the man,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.516
but I'm subject
to the same prejudice as you.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.513
Normally with evidence like this,
charges would be laid.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.278
You lay a charge,
you know as well as I do

14:50.360 --> 14:52.396
the race will be on to find
evidence supporting that charge.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.198
Yes, I don't want that to happen.

14:54.720 --> 14:57.359
We should investigate the possibility
that he's being framed.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.593
But Detective Murdoch
must be incarcerated

15:00.680 --> 15:02.113
for the remainder of the investigation.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.515
This is just temporary
till we solve this thing.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.999
I understand, sir.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.275
"Twas twilly, and the grumbly snifters

15:25.800 --> 15:27.950
"burbled in their moonly sned

15:28.760 --> 15:32.355
"while the brilleautiful Noomava... "

15:32.440 --> 15:33.839
George, what does this mean?

15:33.920 --> 15:36.593
It doesn't mean anything, Higgins,
it's nonsense!

15:36.880 --> 15:38.313
Oh. Like your novel?

15:39.240 --> 15:41.356
<i>I'll have you know that I finished
Curse of the Lost Pharaohs,</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:43.112
and it's so good
I'm sure to write another.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.872
And when I do,
there will be a character based on you,

15:44.960 --> 15:46.632
and he will be the village idiot.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.153
Everyone gather round.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.272
Detective Murdoch has been
placed in custody

15:53.960 --> 15:56.758
and will remain there
until we can prove his innocence.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.233
It's up to us, lads.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.195
We have a time of death, 11:35 pm.

16:03.080 --> 16:04.957
I want to know
where everyone at that party was

16:05.040 --> 16:06.951
in the minutes before and after that.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.758
I want to know who had a motive.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.510
Crabtree, dig into Littlefair's past.
Find out who had a grudge against him.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.272
- Sir.
- Oh, one more thing.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.196
No one outside this stationhouse,
and I mean absolutely no one,

16:18.280 --> 16:21.033
can know that one of our own is
under suspicion of murder.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.231
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.190
Well, what are you all
standing around for?

16:28.200 --> 16:29.553
Inspector Giles.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.432
Allow me to be of assistance.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.034
- Do you mind?
- Oh.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.235
You have post-mortem results, Doctor?

16:43.360 --> 16:46.511
Yes. Mr Littlefair was struck twice
with the mallet.

16:46.720 --> 16:50.474
His entire temple area was shattered,
with shards of bone entering the brain.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.909
Hmm. That sounds decisively fatal to me.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.958
Yes. My feeling is the clock was just...

16:56.040 --> 16:57.234
For good measure.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.353
Quite so, yes.

16:59.680 --> 17:03.036
And have you found evidence of a drug
in Detective Murdoch's blood?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.234
Yes.

17:05.079 --> 17:09.153
His glucose levels were depressed,
suggesting the presence of mescaline.

17:09.599 --> 17:10.714
Mescaline?

17:11.040 --> 17:14.510
It's derived from the mescal cactus.
It was isolated quite recently.

17:14.720 --> 17:16.790
And does this drug make you violent?

17:17.319 --> 17:20.790
No, not at all. Its primary effect is
intense visual hallucinations.

17:21.359 --> 17:24.157
Nevertheless, Detective Murdoch did
become violent, did he not?

17:25.440 --> 17:27.317
There was an incident, yes, but...

17:27.400 --> 17:30.198
I apologise, this is the wrong venue
for this conversation.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.957
When you're finished here, I'd like to
interview you properly at the station.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.835
- Constable.
- What?

17:44.240 --> 17:46.470
- You're staring.
- No, Miss Gardner, I...

17:47.240 --> 17:48.275
Sorry.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.079
I was kicked by a horse in the face
as a young girl.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.996
Where were you at 11:35?

17:54.760 --> 17:58.548
We were playing a game in the parlour.
Well, most of us, anyway.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.474
...and he hit him.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.033
I'd gone to bed by then.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.157
I felt I'd fulfilled my obligations
as the son of the hosts.

18:05.240 --> 18:06.275
We had such high hopes.

18:06.360 --> 18:09.079
We were counting on Mr Littlefair
to buy a larger share of my company.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.835
We'd thrown the party in his honour.
It had all been going so well.

18:13.120 --> 18:18.148
My husband could be
overbearing at times, it's true.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.550
It's no reason to kill a man,
though, is it?

18:22.560 --> 18:25.199
We assumed William had been
the victim of a prank.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.509
I thought it might have been

18:26.600 --> 18:29.034
oil of hashish
or something harmless like that.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.790
It was a Wonderland party, after all.

18:31.920 --> 18:34.070
Oh, for the love of... I bent my nib.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.551
One moment, Miss Ogden,
I believe the detective keeps

18:36.640 --> 18:38.596
some extra nibs in here.

18:39.200 --> 18:40.394
Is that a ring?

18:40.480 --> 18:42.710
- A ring? What? Give me that back!
- It's beautiful.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.155
Miss Ogden, you can't just take
personal items out of the...

18:45.240 --> 18:47.834
"Julia, as long as you exist
in this world... "

18:47.920 --> 18:49.512
Oh, my.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.272
- It's a proposal!
- What?

18:51.600 --> 18:53.272
He was going to propose?

18:53.480 --> 18:56.597
I have no idea! I insist that you...
No, don't put them in there.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.671
Ruby, this is none of our business.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.273
I beg to differ, George.

19:03.400 --> 19:05.868
At first I assumed
he'd had a little too much.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.638
William was not used to liquor.

19:08.040 --> 19:10.713
But then, over the next hour,
he became more disoriented.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.597
And you saw a personality change?

19:12.960 --> 19:14.188
Rather, yes.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.437
Are you feeling any better, William?

19:17.040 --> 19:18.268
- No.
- Thank you.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.549
No.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.317
Hey, frogman!

19:22.840 --> 19:25.115
<i>Mr Littlefair had been
drinking heavily all evening,</i>

19:25.200 --> 19:26.394
<i>and it was beginning to show.</i>

19:26.480 --> 19:28.869
One more drop
and I'm sleeping in another room.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.951
You snore when you're drunk, Randolph.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.996
Fine. Froggy!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.679
I said no more!

19:37.720 --> 19:40.154
Everyone was in shock. And then...

19:40.240 --> 19:41.275
Hey!

19:44.680 --> 19:45.908
- I've half a mind to...
- Yes!

19:46.000 --> 19:48.036
Come now, Mr Turtle.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.916
Let's help you to your bed.

19:52.640 --> 19:53.789
Come on.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.472
What has come over you, William?

19:55.560 --> 19:57.949
I think we need to get
Mr Murdoch upstairs as well.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.156
- We can get him home.
- No, no, I insist.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.832
Believe me, Inspector Giles,

20:06.200 --> 20:09.192
William was in no condition
to leave his room,

20:09.280 --> 20:10.759
let alone kill someone.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.031
Well, thank you, Dr Ogden.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.592
I believe that's all for now.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.752
Would it be possible to see him?

20:21.320 --> 20:24.596
Doctor, do you have
a romantic interest in the detective?

20:25.200 --> 20:28.397
I've noticed that you sometimes
refer to him by his Christian name.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.311
We did have a relationship, yes,
but that isn't...

20:32.400 --> 20:34.994
Well, I wish you'd been
forthright with me about this.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.230
I mean, you must see
how a past relationship casts

20:37.320 --> 20:39.675
every statement you've made
in a different light.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.069
And no. No, you can't see him.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.312
What have you learned, Inspector?

20:52.680 --> 20:55.433
Well, between 11:30 and 11:45,

20:55.520 --> 20:57.795
most of the guests were gathered
in the parlour to play games.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.518
And who was not in the parlour?

20:59.600 --> 21:01.875
Well, the servants were
in various locations.

21:02.280 --> 21:05.317
Two were in the kitchen and one was
loading supplies onto a carriage.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.039
Jack Reda was in his study
and Bradley Reda was in his bed.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.348
Interesting.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.030
If Detective Murdoch's recollections
are truthful,

21:12.120 --> 21:14.953
then the Reda family has good reason
to dislike Randolph Littlefair.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.396
That's right. Littlefair had queered
a business deal on Jack Reda,

21:18.480 --> 21:21.517
and Sonny Boy was in the process of
letting the whole world know about that.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.033
Yes, this is promising.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.915
Let's bring them in.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.432
Am I seriously under suspicion?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.715
You expressed contempt
for Mr Littlefair.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.677
He was a contemptible man.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.194
And your Communist philosophy advocates

21:34.280 --> 21:36.874
the violent overthrow
of capitalist society, does it not?

21:37.120 --> 21:40.715
Through spontaneous revolution,
not one capitalist at a time.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.153
Bradley...

21:42.480 --> 21:44.835
You claim to loathe
your capitalist parents,

21:44.920 --> 21:49.072
but their financial future and yours
had been put at risk by Littlefair.

21:49.160 --> 21:50.718
I call that motive.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.828
Call it what you will.

21:53.640 --> 21:58.191
My son feels that any commercial venture
is, by definition, exploitive.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.957
The fact is,
we needed Mr Littlefair's money,

22:01.040 --> 22:02.917
and while he may have been
pressing his advantage,

22:03.000 --> 22:05.594
I stood to lose more by his death
than I could ever hope to gain.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.829
But not much more.

22:07.640 --> 22:10.757
Several speculative land deals of yours
had just fallen through.

22:10.840 --> 22:13.673
Your construction business is
bleeding badly.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.999
Oh, yes. I checked.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.029
You were using
Littlefair's money like a bank.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.278
But he held all your IOUs.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.592
In a short time,
you would have gone under,

22:24.680 --> 22:28.389
and Littlefair would have owned
every last thing that you owned

22:28.480 --> 22:29.993
for pennies on the dollar.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.469
He was a damned bastard is what he was.

22:32.600 --> 22:33.828
And that's why you killed him.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.149
No.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.472
Killing him is what I wish I'd done.

22:42.040 --> 22:45.237
"Julia, as long as you exist
in this world,

22:45.320 --> 22:47.231
"there will be no one for me but you.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.079
"We can adopt.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.794
"Julia Ogden,
please say you'll marry me".

22:53.680 --> 22:55.193
No, it can't be.

22:56.720 --> 23:00.429
He had every opportunity to say these
things to me before I left for Buffalo.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.837
I don't understand.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.275
- Jules...
- I love Darcy.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.035
I'm happy. I've made my choice.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.836
Doesn't the fact
that you're so upset about this tell you

23:10.920 --> 23:12.876
that your heart feels differently?

23:12.960 --> 23:14.916
Don't you see it's too late?

23:15.160 --> 23:17.913
I can't walk out on Darcy now,
it would break his heart.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.197
Heartbreak is temporary.
Marriage is for life.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.152
For the rest of your life.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.479
This receipt is dated a year ago.
He may not even feel that way anymore.

23:28.760 --> 23:32.355
Then why keep the engagement ring
and his thoughts on the proposal?

23:33.880 --> 23:36.713
- He would have said something.
- Would he have?

23:37.840 --> 23:40.752
The problem is that
he's a fine man who loves you,

23:41.080 --> 23:43.435
but he sees
how you've prepared your future.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.909
He's going to remain silent,
no matter how much it hurts him,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.275
and honour your choice
unless you talk to him.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.636
Jules, you have to say something,
you have to go to him.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.515
I can't.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.232
Inspector Giles has forbidden it.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.869
Well, as I see it,
you have to do something.

24:02.120 --> 24:03.872
My money's on the Communist son.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.518
I don't think so.

24:06.160 --> 24:08.196
He may well have expressed
a dislike for the man,

24:08.280 --> 24:09.315
but then so did Murdoch.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.152
- Have a seat, Giles.
- Oh, thank you.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.478
And who attacked Littlefair
minutes before he was killed?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.391
Whose bed was
the murder weapon found under?

24:16.480 --> 24:17.913
Whose finger marks were all over it?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.433
But what about the boy's father?

24:19.520 --> 24:21.715
Well, I would agree,
except by killing Littlefair,

24:21.800 --> 24:24.030
Jack Reda would only have hastened
his own financial collapse,

24:24.120 --> 24:25.758
throwing his family onto the street.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.519
So you're back on Murdoch, right?

24:28.120 --> 24:30.111
You've had that fixed in your head
from the start.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.713
Like a dog with a bone.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.357
Look, I appreciate your loyalty
to Murdoch, Inspector, I truly do.

24:36.360 --> 24:40.717
But don't ever question my objectivity
as an officer of the law.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.069
He's one of us, Giles.

24:44.160 --> 24:46.196
And that makes it
all the more difficult.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.117
But it doesn't mean that he's innocent.

24:51.360 --> 24:53.999
It's not looking good.
I need you to think.

24:54.440 --> 24:57.796
Someone must have come into your room
to plant the evidence against you.

24:58.360 --> 24:59.759
Do you remember anything?

25:00.440 --> 25:03.512
- Nothing clearly, sir.
- Well, that's not good enough.

25:04.520 --> 25:08.718
Someone may have come into my room,
but I can't be certain.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.590
Bloody hell, Murdoch,
you have to remember.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.034
Who was it?

25:14.160 --> 25:15.798
Your neck is on the line.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.590
Do you
remember me, William?

26:14.120 --> 26:16.588
Was it a dream you had or a memory?

26:17.640 --> 26:19.551
Perhaps a dream of a memory.

26:19.640 --> 26:20.834
Who was it?

26:21.600 --> 26:22.953
The Cheshire Cat.

26:25.120 --> 26:27.236
Mrs Littlefair, did you enter
Detective Murdoch's room

26:27.320 --> 26:28.912
on the night of the party?

26:29.960 --> 26:31.154
No, why would I?

26:31.240 --> 26:33.515
You were dressed
as the Cheshire Cat, correct?

26:33.680 --> 26:34.715
Yes.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.150
And were you in costume
the whole evening?

26:37.640 --> 26:41.189
Hmm... No, I had my mask off
for most of the time.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.077
And where did you leave the mask?

26:44.040 --> 26:45.155
Uh...

26:45.400 --> 26:47.152
On the table downstairs.

26:49.560 --> 26:51.755
Very well. Thank you, Mrs Littlefair.

26:55.200 --> 26:58.476
You and your husband weren't exactly
living in marital bliss, were you?

26:58.880 --> 27:02.589
And now here you are, newly single
and ready to inherit quite a few bob!

27:02.680 --> 27:03.795
Inspector.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.438
You think I killed my husband?

27:05.520 --> 27:07.988
Detective Murdoch saw you
come into his room, love.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.957
That's when you planted
the evidence under his bed.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.234
How dare you?

27:11.600 --> 27:13.670
I have just lost my husband!
I'm grieving!

27:13.760 --> 27:14.829
Grieving.

27:15.480 --> 27:18.199
- Grieving all the way to the bank!
- Inspector, that's enough!

27:18.440 --> 27:19.555
A word.

27:24.040 --> 27:27.589
I made it perfectly clear I conduct
my interviews without interference.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.999
You barely asked her the time of day.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.311
She was downstairs in the parlour
with witnesses at 11:35,

27:32.400 --> 27:33.469
or are you forgetting that?

27:33.560 --> 27:35.471
Someone came into Murdoch's room
with that mask on!

27:35.560 --> 27:38.996
So says Murdoch, and he's got
every reason to lie if he's the killer.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.308
This is Murdoch we're talking about.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.675
Oh, and policemen don't commit murder?

27:42.760 --> 27:45.274
Wasn't it Murdoch
who disproved that theory?

27:51.680 --> 27:53.557
I can't handle the evidence, sir.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.153
Then just look, all right?

27:56.240 --> 27:58.800
I don't need to remind you
that Giles is closing in.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.955
All right, then, George,
fit the pieces together.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.953
Now rotate it.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.032
It's broken to the side, sir.

28:10.800 --> 28:14.110
If the mallet had broken
from the force of striking the victim,

28:14.440 --> 28:16.635
the handle would've broken
back to front.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.151
So the mallet was broken deliberately.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.833
Part of you being framed.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.033
That would be my assumption.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.911
Now, then, what other evidence
might have been tampered with?

28:27.760 --> 28:29.159
This is a striking clock.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.959
Regardless of what the hands say,

28:31.040 --> 28:33.873
the striking mechanism must be set
to chime on the hour.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.236
Now, we can check
the status of the mechanism

28:36.320 --> 28:38.788
to see if it matches the displayed time.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.473
You see here?

28:43.600 --> 28:45.716
The position of the rack and snail cam.

28:46.080 --> 28:47.149
Rack and snail?

28:47.240 --> 28:49.390
It's what determines
the number of chimes.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.717
This clock had already struck midnight
by the time it was stopped.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.916
Can we tell what time
it actually stopped?

28:56.080 --> 28:59.231
Yes, by counting the number of notches
on the gear train.

28:59.800 --> 29:03.429
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

29:04.560 --> 29:06.710
This clock was stopped
at ten after midnight.

29:06.800 --> 29:08.074
12:10?

29:08.160 --> 29:11.038
That was the time of the murder,
not 11:35 pm.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.193
That puts Eleanor Littlefair
back on the suspect list.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.872
Bloody hell, that puts
everybody back on the list.

29:15.960 --> 29:17.154
We'll have to re-interview them all.

29:17.240 --> 29:20.630
So tell me, Inspector, how did you
figure out this clock business?

29:23.280 --> 29:24.599
It was Murdoch, wasn't it?

29:24.680 --> 29:25.874
Sir, you can rest assured

29:25.960 --> 29:28.633
that at no point did Detective Murdoch
come into contact with the evidence.

29:28.720 --> 29:30.392
No, he just told you where to look.

29:30.640 --> 29:32.358
And that didn't strike you
as suspicious?

29:32.480 --> 29:33.708
Suspicious how?

29:33.800 --> 29:35.518
Are you suggesting
that Murdoch framed himself?

29:35.600 --> 29:37.750
He plants evidence
pointing to himself as the killer

29:37.840 --> 29:40.434
knowing that when it's shown to be
false, it will help exonerate him.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.953
- It's brilliant.
- It's idiotic.

29:42.040 --> 29:43.917
It's brilliant, Inspector.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.197
And Murdoch is nothing if not that.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.236
- Sir, we have a problem.
- Now what?

29:56.320 --> 29:58.880
I've checked police and court records
going back more than a decade.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.032
It seems that Randolph Littlefair
changed his name some years back.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.599
He used to be Michael Cudmore

30:03.680 --> 30:06.353
and he had a few run-ins with the law,
including murder.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.478
Murder? Who did he kill?

30:08.560 --> 30:13.076
An innkeeper was found stabbed to death.
Cudmore was charged but later acquitted.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.513
So what's the problem?

30:15.280 --> 30:17.555
The arresting officer was
William H. Murdoch.

30:17.920 --> 30:19.239
Michael Cudmore.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.148
Do you recall the name?

30:21.240 --> 30:23.151
"Drink me!" How delightful!

30:24.160 --> 30:25.878
I'm the Mock Turtle.

30:25.960 --> 30:27.757
Do you
remember me, William?

30:27.920 --> 30:29.672
Murdoch, Cudmore!

30:30.840 --> 30:33.070
Does the name Michael Cudmore
ring any bells?

30:34.280 --> 30:35.713
Michael Cudmore, yes.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.997
I arrested him shortly after I started
with the constabulary.

30:40.800 --> 30:41.994
So you're saying it's coincidence

30:42.080 --> 30:44.674
that 12 years later, you just happened
to be at a party with Cudmore

30:44.760 --> 30:46.591
and someone frames you for his murder.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.470
That's the only explanation I have.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.438
- What do we tell Giles?
- Nothing. We don't say a bloody thing.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.318
Sir, I've spoken with Bradley Reda's
laboratory partner.

30:57.400 --> 31:00.312
- Laboratory partner?
- Apparently he's a chemistry major, sir.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.470
Turns out they've been
isolating mescaline.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.239
It was meant to be a prank.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.278
So it was just by chance that
the man you slipped this drug to

31:07.360 --> 31:09.032
ended up being framed for murder.

31:09.320 --> 31:12.357
I planned to spike the whole punch bowl,
but we couldn't produce enough in time,

31:13.000 --> 31:16.549
so I decided to slip the mescaline
into Randolph Littlefair's drink.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.719
Littlefair? Then how did it
end up in Murdoch's glass?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.911
He must have picked up the wrong glass.

31:22.360 --> 31:23.713
I wouldn't have done this
to your detective.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.394
He was the one person at the party
I actually liked.

31:30.400 --> 31:31.549
Bullocks.

31:31.640 --> 31:34.632
You interviewed Bradley Reda
without my permission, Inspector.

31:36.080 --> 31:39.152
If I hadn't, we wouldn't know
where the mescaline came from.

31:39.240 --> 31:41.470
I thought that might be important,
Inspector Giles.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.437
It is, marginally.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.913
But I've been doing my own digging.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.389
I was surprised to learn that your men
had already discovered

31:48.480 --> 31:51.153
these arrest reports
concerning Murdoch and Cudmore.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.276
Were you planning
on telling me about these?

31:54.360 --> 31:56.635
Of course, but we're
still following that line of...

31:56.720 --> 31:58.233
Save it, Inspector.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.234
You've interfered with my investigation,
and, frankly, I've had enough.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.154
I have no choice but to remove Murdoch
from your custody

32:04.240 --> 32:05.992
and conduct the remainder
of this investigation

32:06.080 --> 32:07.308
from Stationhouse Number Three.

32:07.400 --> 32:10.073
- But you can't!
- It's not a negotiation.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.679
Detective Murdoch...

32:19.280 --> 32:21.589
Have you any idea how that happened?

32:21.720 --> 32:23.039
Bloody hell if I know.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.155
Sir.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.953
He must have picked the lock.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.999
Why would he do it, Crabtree?
Why would he run?

32:38.760 --> 32:40.796
Maybe he lost his faith in us, sir.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.917
Maybe he thought the evidence
against him was so strong that...

32:48.680 --> 32:51.114
Well? Anything on the murder
of that innkeeper?

32:51.200 --> 32:54.272
Sir, I've gone over all the files
for Cudmore's murder charge.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.396
No one at the Wonderland party
connects to the trial.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.198
Well, I might have something here, sir.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.191
One of the witnesses at the trial
later claimed

33:00.280 --> 33:02.236
that Cudmore assaulted her
in the days following.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.639
What was the name?

33:03.920 --> 33:06.559
A Miss Ava Moon, sir. She's an actress.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.551
Cudmore was arrested but never charged.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.273
- Ava Moon?
- Yes.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.872
What? You heard that name before?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.714
Not heard it, seen it. The poem.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.917
Sir, this is the nonsense poem
from the Wonderland party.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.468
It tells the story of a maiden, Noomava.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.471
She's attacked by an ogre,
but she manages to fend him off

33:24.560 --> 33:25.834
and she slays him.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.275
- What are you showing me this for?
- Well, sir, look here.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.999
"Noomava" is Ava Moon backwards.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.395
Who wrote this?

33:34.800 --> 33:38.110
But we all wrote this.
We made up nonsense words.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.915
What about this Noomava
mentioned in the poem?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.514
Ava Moon? That wouldn't be you,
now would it, Mrs Reda?

33:43.600 --> 33:45.716
Inspector, there's no such person.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.553
So I'm not to read anything
into the fact that these nonsense words

33:48.640 --> 33:49.834
magically turned into a story

33:49.920 --> 33:52.150
about a maiden
who killed a beast that attacked her?

33:52.240 --> 33:54.470
Well, it wasn't magic,
we had to work at it a bit.

33:54.560 --> 33:56.551
- We?
- Constance and I.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.598
Well, it was all her idea, really.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.316
It was quite ingenious the way she
pieced a story together out of it all.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.913
- Constance?
- Yes.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.399
The woman who helped you with the party?

34:05.480 --> 34:06.515
Yes.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.712
You wouldn't happen to have
her address, would you?

34:12.440 --> 34:14.431
I didn't expect to see you in person.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.877
I assumed you'd be in jail.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.272
But I knew you'd figure it out.

34:19.920 --> 34:23.196
I was hoping to have been gone
by then, of course.

34:23.800 --> 34:26.678
I was never very lucky, was I?

34:27.040 --> 34:29.315
Ava, I needed to see you

34:30.880 --> 34:33.792
to tell you that I understand
why you framed me

34:34.280 --> 34:38.193
and how truly sorry I am
for what's happened to you.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.556
Well, it's a bit late for that,
isn't it?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.194
I suppose so.

34:45.560 --> 34:48.916
Now I'm afraid you'll have to come
with me to face the murder charge.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.839
You would do that to me?

34:50.920 --> 34:52.433
I'll argue for leniency.

34:52.520 --> 34:56.149
I'll tell the judge that Littlefair
hurt you deeply, savagely.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.110
Perhaps you didn't realise, Detective.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.637
I wasn't his last victim.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.231
Brigitte Marneau from Montreal.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.551
He held his knife against her cheek
while he raped her. She lived.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.673
Mavis Hedge from Belleville
wasn't so lucky.

35:13.400 --> 35:14.992
He was there, I checked.

35:15.080 --> 35:18.356
It was Cudmore or Littlefair,
whatever you want to call him.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.158
And this was just a month ago.

35:20.440 --> 35:22.510
How many others
that we don't know about?

35:23.480 --> 35:25.436
Why didn't you bring this to the police?

35:25.880 --> 35:27.871
Well, I tried that
once before, didn't I?

35:28.400 --> 35:29.958
Didn't work out so well for me.

35:30.240 --> 35:33.073
Taking the law into your own hands
has repercussions, Ava.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.115
So does raping and killing women.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.512
Or butchering them so badly
they cannot have children.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.680
But the law doesn't always work
the way it should.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.797
Haven't you seen that in the 12 years
since this happened to me?

35:50.560 --> 35:52.437
Have you not changed in that time?

35:54.160 --> 35:57.072
Is the letter of the law
still all you care about?

35:57.520 --> 35:58.794
Even when it's wrong?

36:00.040 --> 36:03.112
Michael Cudmore would have
kept on killing.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.599
He deserved his fate and worse.

36:08.840 --> 36:10.478
You know what I did was just.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.798
What choice do I have?

36:15.600 --> 36:17.318
Then will you watch my hanging?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.392
If that's the verdict, yes.

36:22.960 --> 36:24.075
It's my duty.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.231
Then I will see you on that day.

36:33.520 --> 36:34.714
Murdoch.

36:39.560 --> 36:40.913
She was an actress.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.118
She rented a room
at an inn along my beat.

36:45.240 --> 36:48.357
One night, she heard cries
coming from the innkeeper's room,

36:48.440 --> 36:50.192
and then saw a man leaving.

36:51.160 --> 36:55.278
She didn't see his face,
but she recognised his coat, his walk.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.279
I arrested Cudmore,

36:58.720 --> 37:01.314
and my inspector
at Stationhouse Number One

37:01.560 --> 37:02.834
beat a confession out of him.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.833
Ava was terrified of Cudmore
and refused to testify against him.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.590
But I convinced her it was her duty,

37:13.240 --> 37:15.310
that she should trust in the law.

37:16.240 --> 37:18.435
- But he wasn't convicted.
- No.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.593
That wasn't your fault.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.832
Actually, it was.

37:26.120 --> 37:29.476
My inspector testified
that the confession was voluntary,

37:30.720 --> 37:33.678
but I zealously told the truth.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.831
The confession was thrown out
and the case collapsed.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.034
And then Michael Cudmore
took revenge on Ava Moon.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.553
Why wasn't he arrested for that?

37:46.040 --> 37:47.553
Insufficient evidence.

37:48.240 --> 37:50.879
It was dark,
the middle of the night, etc.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.149
The prosecution didn't believe

37:53.240 --> 37:56.550
that Ava's identification of Cudmore
would stand up at trial.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.916
So you can see
why she doesn't trust in the law.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.754
Murdoch.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.518
What the devil's going on here?

38:07.640 --> 38:09.312
Cudmore took his knife to me.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.559
Not just my face.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.588
He did things

38:15.080 --> 38:16.957
I couldn't begin to describe to you.

38:18.560 --> 38:22.678
Everything I ever wanted in life,
marriage, children,

38:24.720 --> 38:27.234
ended the night he came into my room.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.475
He moved out of Ontario after that.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.160
Then a few months ago
I saw his picture in the newspaper.

38:36.240 --> 38:38.834
Oh, he'd changed his name
to Randolph Littlefair,

38:39.320 --> 38:40.514
but I knew it was him.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.279
So you plotted to kill him?

38:43.600 --> 38:46.751
I had friends in common
with Alexandra Reda,

38:47.360 --> 38:50.636
and when I learned the Redas were
going into partnership with Cudmore,

38:50.720 --> 38:53.314
a plan materialised.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.955
I suggested the party for that reason.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.156
And how did you know
Detective Murdoch would be there?

38:59.760 --> 39:00.909
I didn't.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.588
That was just one of those
strange things in life.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.389
I realised if I pointed
the suspicion on him,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.468
it would give me time
to make a clean break.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.318
But I wouldn't have let him hang.

39:17.080 --> 39:19.230
I was going to leave
a confession in my room.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.594
But he arrived
before I could make my escape.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.672
And now it's me who's going to hang.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.435
It seems the law
is finally done with me.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.518
Escaping from police custody is
a serious offence.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.990
I had to inform
Chief Constable Stockton,

39:47.480 --> 39:50.870
and, as you're no doubt aware,
there may well be consequences.

39:51.320 --> 39:52.912
I had to see Ava again.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.918
To make amends somehow.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.837
Bring her in with dignity.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.074
To get at the truth.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.352
The truth at all costs.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.639
She'll likely hang.

40:07.040 --> 40:09.315
Her sad story may sway the judge.

40:09.920 --> 40:13.037
But it was premeditated murder,
there's no getting around that.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.148
A lesser policeman than yourself
might have been

40:20.240 --> 40:22.515
inclined to look the other way.

40:23.920 --> 40:26.036
But you and I are not
arbiters of justice.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.277
We are merely servants of the law.

40:30.040 --> 40:33.350
It is no simple task
to remain incorruptible,

40:34.200 --> 40:36.668
especially in defiance
of one's own conscience.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.230
Cold comfort, eh, Inspector?

40:47.760 --> 40:50.433
Sir, good to see you a free man again.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.035
Thank you, George.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.394
This was left at my desk.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.277
I'm quite sure
that's Dr Ogden's handwriting.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.954
I didn't really have an opportunity
to get it to you until now.

40:58.360 --> 40:59.429
Thank you.

41:02.040 --> 41:04.315
Well, we're off to the wedding.
Will you be attending?

41:04.400 --> 41:06.709
There's something
that I need to take care of first,

41:06.800 --> 41:08.153
but, if there's time, yes.

41:08.840 --> 41:09.955
Well, sir, I...

41:11.520 --> 41:13.033
Should get going, I suppose.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.351
I do hope to see you there, sir.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.234
<i>Dearest William,</i>

41:42.880 --> 41:46.395
<i>I am writing this during what should be
the happiest time of my life,</i>

41:47.920 --> 41:50.354
<i>and yet my heart has never been
more troubled.</i>

41:54.520 --> 41:57.671
<i>I have learned of the marriage proposal
you intended to make to me.</i>

41:59.640 --> 42:01.073
<i>If your feelings are the same,</i>

42:01.160 --> 42:03.799
<i>you must let me know
before I make my vows.</i>

42:05.680 --> 42:10.231
<i>If they are not, then I will marry Darcy
and we will never speak of this.</i>

42:11.320 --> 42:14.073
<i>Either way,
I will know your true feelings</i>

42:14.240 --> 42:16.071
<i>and my heart will be in peace.</i>

42:16.880 --> 42:18.154
<i>Love, Julia.</i>

42:41.880 --> 42:44.440
Take the CP Rail
to Hamilton immediately.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.432
Don't stay on the train any longer,
or they will catch you.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.868
Here. Take a carriage from Hamilton,
find a boarding house,

42:52.280 --> 42:54.191
try not to draw any attention
to yourself.

42:54.560 --> 42:58.030
Wait a month and cross the border
at Windsor on an overnight train.

42:58.800 --> 42:59.949
- Detective, are you...
- The station watch is

43:00.040 --> 43:02.600
at a wedding ceremony.
They'll be back shortly.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.039
Why are you doing this?

43:07.440 --> 43:10.273
If I had acted
the way I should have back then,

43:10.360 --> 43:12.828
perhaps none of this
would have happened.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.954
It's one mistake I can set right.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.756
But this could cost you your career.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.038
You'll never know what it's cost me.

43:52.200 --> 43:54.395
...and forsaking all others,

43:54.480 --> 43:57.597
be faithful to him
as long as you both shall live?

43:58.960 --> 44:00.109
I do.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.279
You were missed at the wedding.

44:05.400 --> 44:06.435
Sir.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.999
I don't blame you, Murdoch.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.234
It's no secret how you feel
about Dr Ogden.

44:11.960 --> 44:13.473
I am sorry, me old mucker.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.878
I received this a few hours ago.

44:19.160 --> 44:21.958
Thought I'd hold off
until after the wedding celebrations.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.636
There's no two ways
to say this, Murdoch.

44:25.920 --> 44:27.194
The Chief Constable has determined

44:27.280 --> 44:29.510
the price you'll pay
for breaking out of jail.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.718
You're suspended three weeks
with a reprimand on record.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.998
Well, that's not so bad, right?

44:35.480 --> 44:37.869
Slap on the wrist
and you'll be right back at it.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.391
Actually, sir, it's going to be
much worse than that for me.

44:42.920 --> 44:44.751
There's something I need to tell you.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.756
Best pour us both a drink.
