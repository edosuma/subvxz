-(GASPS) That's such a good idea.

-Nope, just get the mouth on.

something of her own creation...

<i>from a giant robotic claw.</i>

<i>The aliens are made</i>
<i>of watermelon and fondant.</i>

32:44.295 --> 32:48.633

<i>he's just a big taffy man.</i>

<i>is cheese and popcorn.</i>

-Fifty.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.087
I hope I got that right!

33:26.796 --> 33:29.674
<i>I mean, not only does</i>
<i>the claw give you so much movement,</i>

33:29.757 --> 33:31.259
<i>and I'm not talking about when it's on.</i>

33:31.509 --> 33:33.302
I'm talking about right now.
It is in action,

33:33.386 --> 33:36.264
it is a snake serpent just trying
to attack with that claw.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.641
And then the last thing
that ties the movement

33:38.766 --> 33:41.602
through the flow of the piece altogether
is, of course, the cape.

33:41.769 --> 33:44.397
<i>It's also... Has the illusion of movement,</i>

33:44.564 --> 33:47.608
and I think that
the whole piece flows really beautifully.

33:47.942 --> 33:51.279
The painting techniques
on the cape, spot on.

33:51.612 --> 33:53.281
-Yeah, that was all her.
-That was her, she did that!

33:53.448 --> 33:54.532
-Really good on that.
-KEKE: Katherine.

33:54.782 --> 33:56.993

incredible job.

-Thank you.

Well, guys, I know you hate it
and you're tired of melting candy...

34:02.040 --> 34:03.666
-Yes!
-...but that's actually one of

34:03.750 --> 34:05.626
-the best part from this piece. I love it!
-KATHERINE: Oh good!

34:06.002 --> 34:08.296

<i>that that is actual plastic.</i>

34:08.379 --> 34:09.380
KEKE: <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

34:10.214 --> 34:12.008
BENNY:<i> But then the issue that I have</i>

34:12.216 --> 34:15.094
is that it looks
like two different pieces.

34:15.261 --> 34:17.513
Like, the bottom part
is really beautiful shining,

34:17.638 --> 34:21.267
and it's giving me the plastic effect,
while the top part

34:21.350 --> 34:22.560
-I know is buttercream...
-KRISTEN: <i>Yeah.</i>

34:22.643 --> 34:25.772
<i>...and it's a little more flat.</i>
<i>But as an overall, guys,</i>

34:25.855 --> 34:27.190
<i>you guys did an excellent job.</i>

34:27.273 --> 34:28.316
-Thank you.
-It was a blast.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.319

-Waiting for your train?
-JENN: We are.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.789
-Yeah.
-Like usual.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.499
How are you guys feeling?

34:45.208 --> 34:47.001
-Exhausted.
-Exhausted but relieved.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.046
I think we're surprised
that we pulled it off

34:50.505 --> 34:53.674
and, you know, we used food in a way
that we didn't know would work.

so we can save Friendly Bot 3000,

<i>in the world, New York City.</i>

<i>in the New York Subway</i>

<i>Rex is made from rice cereal treats,</i>

35:21.536 --> 35:24.914
<i>he is coated</i>
<i>in coconut pistachios and broccoli.</i>

35:25.081 --> 35:29.877
<i>His arms are made of broccoli stems,</i>
<i>we gave him garlic clove teeth.</i>

35:30.461 --> 35:35.174
<i>Hamm is made of cake</i>
<i>coated in Himalayan pink sea salt,</i>

35:35.591 --> 35:39.137
<i>we sculpted his tail and ears</i>
<i>out of pink bubblegum.</i>

<i>The rat is made out of rice cereal treats,</i>
<i>coated in buttercream, and coconut.</i>

<i>-He has cherry tomatoes for eyes...</i>
-KEKE:<i> So cool.</i>

35:48.020 --> 35:51.899
<i>...with LED lights on the inside,</i>
<i>to give him that mean look.</i>

35:52.400 --> 35:55.319
We also have things like
the very classic coffee cup

35:55.403 --> 35:57.947
from New York City
with some coffee spilled out of it.

35:58.364 --> 36:01.117
What I love about this piece
is the texture.

36:03.035 --> 36:07.123
I have never seen broccoli used
in this way, and I'm in love with it.

36:07.707 --> 36:10.835
When you mentioned broccoli, I was worried
in the beginning because the weight,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.713
<i>but you guys, the way</i>
<i>that you used the broccoli on Rex,</i>

36:14.422 --> 36:17.466
mixed with the pistachio,
which I love pistachio,

36:17.800 --> 36:19.468
it w... it was just genius.

36:19.552 --> 36:20.553
Thank you!

36:20.845 --> 36:25.391
The action of Hamm who's always, sort of,
making sure everything is under control

36:25.600 --> 36:31.230
and Rex who is terrified of everything,
is so spot on to their characteristics,

36:31.314 --> 36:34.233
<i>it's so </i>Toy Story.<i> The fact</i>
<i>that you actually color-matched</i>

36:34.525 --> 36:39.363
with real food, Himalayan salt,
broccoli, with pistachio.

36:39.614 --> 36:44.118
Using the stem of the broccoli to create
the hands that's really impressive,

36:44.285 --> 36:47.246
and creative thinking,
but something I would have done

36:47.496 --> 36:50.583
a little bit differently
is how you incorporated the plot thickens.

<i>the pizza for pizza.</i>

something just so creative, right.

The one thing that is very distracting
is the popcorn over here.

37:01.135 --> 37:04.889
I just wish that you incorporated it
not by just by tossing it around.

<i>Pufferfish made out of dragon fruit.</i>

<i>and then we've got lasagna noodles</i>
<i>for the planks of wood on the side,</i>

<i>And then the steering wheel is</i>
<i>the entire pizza and jerky sticks.</i>

38:45.740 --> 38:47.992
The challenge was to distract Andy.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.285
This is so distracting,

38:49.368 --> 38:51.495
-(ALL LAUGH)
-I think that... I think that I can spend,

38:51.620 --> 38:54.749
so much time just going
through every little detail.

38:55.666 --> 38:58.794
<i>Story-wise, when you guys said underwater,</i>
<i>I was thinking to myself,</i>

38:58.878 --> 39:00.838
"That's a big challenge,"
and you guys did it.

39:01.547 --> 39:03.007
<i>You have the bubbles going up,</i>

39:03.090 --> 39:05.051
<i>and it's just so creative,</i>
<i>how he's flipping</i>

39:05.134 --> 39:07.303
<i>because the bubbles are,</i>
<i>sort of, flipping him over</i>

39:07.428 --> 39:09.055
<i>and that's where you created movement.</i>

39:09.138 --> 39:11.432
The way that you guys used
the plot thickens

39:11.724 --> 39:15.478
with the pizza as the wheel
that is just so genius. I love it,

39:15.644 --> 39:18.105
you're using its natural shape,
but you are transforming it

39:18.230 --> 39:22.526
into something else, but I definitely
think that Buzz having a helmet,

39:22.651 --> 39:27.365
that would have just given so much more
to the illusion that they are underwater.

39:27.448 --> 39:28.491
Ran out of time.

39:28.824 --> 39:31.202
-For this type of element, do it first...
-KYLIE: Yes.

39:31.577 --> 39:33.621
...in the early hours,
so if something happen,

39:33.704 --> 39:35.373
-you have time to recover from that.
-KYLIE: Yeah.

BENNY: <i>There's so much fun</i>
<i>and so many details. Technically,</i>

39:41.295 --> 39:44.382
I love the way that you created the chest.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.385
<i>I love the old, rusty,</i>
<i>wooden look that you gave us.</i>

39:47.593 --> 39:49.136
The way that you guys used the pasta,

39:49.595 --> 39:52.306
<i>brilliant, because you used</i>
<i>the shape of the pasta</i>

39:52.431 --> 39:54.392
<i>to create the specific designs.</i>

39:54.725 --> 39:58.354
<i>Buzz and the Aliens,</i>
<i>they totally looks like</i>

39:58.646 --> 40:01.941

<i>I love the variation of colors</i>

-I mean, watermelon turtles.

-It's so hard,

40:21.544 --> 40:24.338
-I hate this part of the show.
-This is one of my favorite movies.

so many different mediums
is just incredible too.
