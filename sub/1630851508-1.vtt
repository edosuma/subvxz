01:15.476 --> 01:20.146
10, nine, eight, seven,

01:20.148 --> 01:24.150
six, five, four,

01:24.152 --> 01:27.453
three, two, one.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.790
This is
an important bust.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.025
We need it after Slater
fucked up that raid

01:34.027 --> 01:35.196
at the strip club.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.830
Say hi, Gary.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.132
Hi, Gary.

01:40.134 --> 01:42.201
First
drug raid, Gary?

01:42.203 --> 01:43.003
Yeah.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.572
We're coming up!

01:46.574 --> 01:49.007
I'll make the announcement
when we get inside!

01:49.009 --> 01:52.110
Police, search warrant, don't
move, show me your hands!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.513
Lab says that goopy
shit from the van

01:54.515 --> 01:56.715
is a monster of a compound.

01:56.717 --> 01:57.518
So what?

01:58.652 --> 02:02.421
Do you shoot it,
slurp it, or sniff it?

02:02.423 --> 02:05.257
Well, we're about to find out.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.226
Let's assume it's
very fucking potent

02:07.228 --> 02:08.494
and highly addictive!

02:08.496 --> 02:10.828
Well we all saw what
it did to that girl.

02:20.608 --> 02:21.442
Let's roll out!

02:39.293 --> 02:40.226
Listen up.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.394
Get down means get fucking down.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.129
10-26 means crime in progress,

02:44.131 --> 02:47.132
and 29-9 means erase
the fucking tape.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.368
Hey, you stay with me.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.339
Running out, going in!

02:53.106 --> 02:55.440
Police, search warrant!

02:55.442 --> 02:59.177
Police, search warrant!

02:59.179 --> 03:01.146
- Police!
- Police, search warrant!

03:01.148 --> 03:03.114
Police, police!

03:03.116 --> 03:04.983
- Search warrant!
- Coming up on your left.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.652
- Search warrant!
- Don't fucking shoot!

03:06.654 --> 03:08.787
- Search warrant!
- We're taking the lead!

03:08.789 --> 03:09.921
Get the fuck back!

03:09.923 --> 03:12.025
- Low to the left!
- Damn it!

03:14.328 --> 03:16.127
Where
are these fucks?

03:16.129 --> 03:17.596
Oursler,
Slater, check in.

03:17.598 --> 03:20.466
- Search warrant!
- We're seeing planes here.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.368
These guys could be
heavier-armed than we thought.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.502
Keep
this channel clear,

03:23.504 --> 03:25.337
you fucking professional!

03:28.175 --> 03:29.510
All are welcome.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.944
All are watching.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.580
Finally, followers,

03:34.582 --> 03:37.649
tonight is the night
you've been waiting for.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.751
Track my signal.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.920
- The signal is the stimulant.
- Clear!

03:41.922 --> 03:43.689
- The signal is the sedative.
- Clear!

03:43.691 --> 03:45.924
The
signal is salvation.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.393
What the
hell is that smell?

03:47.395 --> 03:51.029
- Forever starts right now.
- Birkhorn, don't move!

03:51.031 --> 03:52.266
Hands in the air, motherfucker.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.733
Fuck.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.369
Oh, those fucking eyes.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.972
Hey,
I know this guy.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.143
He owns the video
store on my block.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.612
This is
Brayberry, we founds some

04:06.614 --> 04:08.880
of that goopy shit
from the videotape.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.052
We've also got a 419,
could be self-inflicted.

04:13.053 --> 04:16.021
- Police, first squad!
- Police!

04:27.835 --> 04:29.301
Are you gonna
keep crying, Slater,

04:29.303 --> 04:33.073
or are you gonna find
me some drugs in there?

04:49.022 --> 04:51.091
Police, search warrant!

04:52.292 --> 04:53.759
Slater,
we've got bodies!

04:53.761 --> 04:55.894
Maybe get another
tac unit on standby.

04:58.699 --> 05:02.570
This is a crime scene,
do not touch anything.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.738
Don't fuck with
my scene, Slater!

05:06.740 --> 05:08.807
Slater, let's keep moving.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.275
Got a lot of building to clear.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.612
We'll take the upper level.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.347
Hey, I
don't think that girl

05:15.349 --> 05:17.150
from the videotape is in here.

05:18.719 --> 05:22.120
It's an information
superhighway that spans the globe,

05:22.122 --> 05:24.189
and it is called internet,

05:24.191 --> 05:26.992
or just the net
to frequent users.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.260
Today millions of Americans
have personal computers

05:29.262 --> 05:32.097
and can access the net
for a modest monthly fee.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.931
I think I'll stick to
my telephone for now.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.370
And in local news, a number
of Westerville residents

05:38.372 --> 05:41.507
have come forward with
stories of a mysterious figure

05:41.509 --> 05:43.475
they're calling the Rat Man.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.176
Sounds like a
superhero, Camille.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.013
That is no
superhero I'd want to meet, Mark.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.683
Eyewitnesses have said that
this man or man-animal hybrid

05:51.685 --> 05:53.852
lives in the sewers
and comes out at night,

05:53.854 --> 05:56.154
but if you shine a
light directly at it,

05:56.156 --> 05:58.123
it suddenly disappears.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.026
Channel Six's Holly
Marciano has more.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.161
Is he an urban legend?

06:03.163 --> 06:06.131
Or is there really a
creature of unknown origin

06:06.133 --> 06:07.966
lurking within the sewers?

06:07.968 --> 06:10.368
I was just out here
taking a walk at night

06:10.370 --> 06:13.240
and I heard it making
noises down there.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.845
And it looked up at me like a...

06:20.247 --> 06:21.980
A fucking clown.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.750
This amateur sketch
resembles what many of you say

06:24.752 --> 06:26.552
the Rat Man looks like.

06:26.554 --> 06:29.187
Almost everyone has come
up with their own theories

06:29.189 --> 06:31.492
and explanations for the image.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.926
Yeah, my theory is the
dude's from the fucking prison

06:34.928 --> 06:38.063
in Athens for like
the criminally insane.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.330
That's where my cousin went.

06:39.332 --> 06:41.733
Yeah, her crazy-ass
cousin was in there,

06:41.735 --> 06:44.703
so he's like an
escaped mental case.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.039
Oh, and he lives in the sewer
so that nobody can find him.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.577
Well, I believe it's
a sign from Jesus.

06:51.579 --> 06:54.780
It's time for
sinners and elitists

06:54.782 --> 06:56.249
to get what's coming to them.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.551
Mm-hm.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.053
So tell me, where did
you first see him?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.655
Right there.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.891
Behind me, that's
where I saw him.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.727
Right there.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.363
Okay, we're done.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.734
Thank you for your service.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.369
Fucking last time I need
to be in this forest.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.205
We could have picked
an easier path, you know.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.408
There are no paths.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.544
Yeah.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.116
So do you want more
B-roll of the forest?

07:31.184 --> 07:32.851
No, we have all
kinds of footage

07:32.853 --> 07:36.389
of the forest and the
mouth of the drain.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.292
Jesus, Barry, what, what
does he want us to do,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.228
walk through raw sewage?

07:43.230 --> 07:45.032
No, I'm not being
dramatic, I just...

07:48.401 --> 07:49.202
Yeah.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.070
Yep, no problem.

07:52.072 --> 07:52.971
Okay.

07:55.543 --> 07:56.942
Looking
a little stressed.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.579
You wanna get a
drink afterwards?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.047
- Jeff?
- Yeah?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.851
- Fuck you.
- Copy that.

08:11.424 --> 08:14.092
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

08:14.094 --> 08:15.527
- Westerville's very own...
- He said he might want it

08:15.529 --> 08:18.396
from inside the
drain, though, right?

08:18.398 --> 08:19.865
Yeah.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.935
I mean, it's a health
hazard, look at it.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.309
Where is it?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.379
That guy's creepy.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.283
Yeah, let's get
out of his eye line.

08:39.787 --> 08:42.988
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

08:42.990 --> 08:46.224
Westerville's very
own Loch Ness monster.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.627
It's a mystery that
can only be told

08:48.629 --> 08:52.063
inside the cavernous
tunnels beneath our feet.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.566
I'm Holly Marciano,
Channel Six News.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.641
Construction?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.511
- Let's go again.
- Yeah, going again.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.413
Hang on, just gotta get focus.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.684
And, all right.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.688
This is the remarkable
story of the Rat Man,

09:16.690 --> 09:19.658
Westerville's very
own Loch Ness monster.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.360
- It's a myst...
- Uh, the hell is that?

09:22.362 --> 09:23.595
Are you even,
what are you doing?

09:23.597 --> 09:26.297
No, no, no,
there's someone there.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.135
- Seriously.
- Oh my god.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.171
I don't have the time
for these shenanigans,

09:33.173 --> 09:35.306
can you with me
about something else?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.277
Gimme a sec,
Holly, just hold on.

09:39.913 --> 09:40.748
Hello?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.487
Excuse me.

09:48.756 --> 09:53.761
Oh man, are you fucking kidding?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.067
What is it?

10:02.069 --> 10:03.904
I don't know.

10:09.042 --> 10:09.877
Ah.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.413
Yeah, it's just a bunch of junk.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.619
You think kids live down here?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.020
I don't know if
you'd call this living,

10:22.022 --> 10:23.991
but yeah, I mean, it's possible.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.526
Jesus Christ.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.930
You know, we are the
richest country in the world

10:31.932 --> 10:34.465
and we treat people like this.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.402
It's shameful.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.540
We should record more of this.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.175
Right, evidence
of what it's like

10:44.177 --> 10:46.144
to actually live down here.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.746
Wow, you are
really selling this, Holly.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.280
Don't be a dick.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.182
I'm serious, this
is a good story.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.218
Don't you
have an AA meeting?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.753
Fuck, I don't
want to sit around

10:54.755 --> 10:56.454
and talk about my fucking
drinking problem, okay?

10:56.456 --> 10:57.723
Don't you want to do something

10:57.725 --> 10:59.457
that will make a
difference, Jeff?

10:59.459 --> 11:01.693
That will like, I don't
know, help people?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.594
Help you get
your Pulitzer, right?

11:03.596 --> 11:06.133
This is what we're
talking about.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.202
Holly!

11:11.204 --> 11:12.205
- Holly!
- Come!

11:14.374 --> 11:15.841
I need your light.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.709
Ah, fuck.

11:17.711 --> 11:19.212
Come on.

11:53.213 --> 11:57.148
What are you doing?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.285
What?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.756
What's going on?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.792
I think someone's here.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.627
Come on.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.634
Holy shit.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.810
Check, look behind you, check.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.082
This must be where he lives.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.350
Okay, so let's,

12:32.352 --> 12:34.219
I don't think we should be
messing with this right now.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.420
We don't have to
mess with anything,

12:35.422 --> 12:36.824
just get some footage.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.284
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff...

13:06.286 --> 13:07.652
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.753
- Just calm down, calm down.
- No, no, no, no.

13:08.755 --> 13:09.754
Take a deep breath.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.788
I'm not, fuck.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.390
fuck, is that him?

13:12.392 --> 13:14.392
It's okay, just
take a deep breath, all right?

13:14.394 --> 13:16.761
We didn't come this
far to get nothing.

13:16.763 --> 13:20.866
Just take a deep breath,
let me get your camera.

13:20.868 --> 13:21.701
It's okay.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.705
Okay.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.006
- Give me a sec.
- Okay, good?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.140
Yeah,
just give me a sec.

13:29.142 --> 13:29.977
Okay.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.953
I'm ready,
do you see him?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.288
Yeah.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.459
Just relax.

13:47.928 --> 13:48.761
Hi.

13:50.730 --> 13:51.564
Hello.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.301
We didn't mean to scare you.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.604
We're, we're friends, we just...

13:59.606 --> 14:01.808
We wanna ask you just
a couple of questions.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.543
Is that okay?

14:05.946 --> 14:08.181
Okay, I'm gonna come
a little bit closer.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.819
Okay, okay.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.859
Can I ask you what your name is?

14:21.728 --> 14:23.361
Bill.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.197
Bill.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.267
It's really nice
to meet you, Bill.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.071
I'm Holly, and that's Jeff.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.375
Do you have a last name, Bill?

14:40.780 --> 14:43.383
Are there other people that
live down here with you?

14:47.454 --> 14:49.222
Raatma.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.025
I'm sorry,
can you repeat that?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.027
Did you say Rat Man?

14:56.029 --> 14:58.565
Are, are you the Rat Man, Bill?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.202
Okay, uh...

15:06.539 --> 15:07.374
Thank you.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.542
I'm going to leave
you my business card,

15:11.544 --> 15:13.344
- right here.
- Holly!

15:13.346 --> 15:18.351
I'd love to follow up...

15:33.366 --> 15:35.333
Holly, Holly...

15:35.335 --> 15:36.169
Holly?

15:38.972 --> 15:39.806
Holly!

15:41.808 --> 15:43.174
Fuck this, I'm out,
I'm out of here.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.544
What...

16:23.783 --> 16:24.717
What the...

16:31.191 --> 16:32.025
Oh my god!

16:33.426 --> 16:34.261
What?

16:37.297 --> 16:38.798
What, I don't know

16:40.333 --> 16:42.102
what you want with...

16:46.005 --> 16:47.006
There are...

16:49.676 --> 16:51.578
There are people
that can help you,

16:52.712 --> 16:55.948
that can get you
on your feet, okay?

16:59.886 --> 17:03.823
I'm actually doing
a story on you.

17:05.558 --> 17:07.460
To show people that...

17:09.996 --> 17:11.929
That you're just, you're just...

17:11.931 --> 17:14.464
You're normal, just
you need some help,

17:14.467 --> 17:16.267
and I can help you.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.602
Okay, I can...

17:17.604 --> 17:19.436
If you just let me,
I can help you, okay?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.471
Just let me help you.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.108
- How?
- And I can help...

17:24.041 --> 17:25.078
How would you help?

17:29.782 --> 17:32.783
I wanted to tell
their stories.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.019
I would tell their
stories to the public.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.754
- Oh.
- I would help you.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.357
That's a very generous offer,

17:39.359 --> 17:41.861
but we're gonna
tell our own story.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.364
- Jeff?
- Holly?

17:46.366 --> 17:47.965
- Jeff, Jeff?
- Holly!

17:47.967 --> 17:49.500
Jeff!

17:49.502 --> 17:54.507
Stop, stop!

17:56.476 --> 18:00.245
No, turn that light
off, you're scaring him.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.013
Come on.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.781
Come on.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.352
That's it, come on.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.083
In the name of Raatma.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.355
No, no!

18:44.357 --> 18:47.126
Please, no, no!

18:48.027 --> 18:50.628
Help me, please, no!

18:50.630 --> 18:52.062
- Please, no!
- I thought you were

18:52.064 --> 18:55.266
gonna do one of your
little news stories on us.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.134
No, please.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.570
Now you might
not realize it yet,

18:59.572 --> 19:02.275
but you are witnessing the
beginning of a new era.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.912
Only the righteous shall rise.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.216
Your friend wasn't worthy,
but you, who knows?

19:11.218 --> 19:15.019
For all of your sins,
you could be saved.

19:15.021 --> 19:15.855
No!

19:16.989 --> 19:19.457
No, please, please!

19:19.459 --> 19:24.464
No!

19:25.332 --> 19:26.866
- No, please!
- Give me that.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.438
It's time to see if you're
welcome in the new world.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.274
It's not for me to
answer evil for evil.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.244
We leave that to the
wrath of our new god.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.920
Please, no, god!

20:12.945 --> 20:15.114
Why, God?

20:19.986 --> 20:21.452
Compression technology.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.854
The Veggie Masher turns your
ordinary drab vegetables

20:23.856 --> 20:27.858
into a tasty, mouthwatering
paste in mere seconds.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.827
Just mash and enjoy.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.195
With the Veggie Masher
from Wonder Health,

20:31.197 --> 20:33.498
you can finally unleash
the full vitamin

20:33.500 --> 20:35.500
and nutrient
potential of carrots,

20:35.502 --> 20:38.436
broccoli, peppers, peas.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.704
So why wait?

20:39.706 --> 20:41.772
Call this toll-free
number and order now.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.374
The Veggie Masher
from Wonder Health,

20:43.376 --> 20:46.143
a subsidiary of Mega
Tech Pharmaceuticals.

20:49.649 --> 20:52.283
Now I am very glad to
have our wonderful coworker

20:52.285 --> 20:55.453
Holly Marciano with us
following her incredible rescue

20:55.455 --> 20:58.523
after she got trapped
in a storm drain.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.458
Okay, come on.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.695
Come on, give me your hand.

21:15.375 --> 21:16.576
Gripping stuff.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.411
And as I'm sure our
viewers are by now aware,

21:20.413 --> 21:22.947
we are very sad to report
that cameraman Jeff Wohl

21:22.949 --> 21:24.882
has yet to be found.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.618
But Holly, we are so
happy to have you back.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.622
Thank you, Mark,
it's good to be back.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.557
It's the first day of fall,

21:32.559 --> 21:34.692
and there's no better way
to kick off the season

21:34.694 --> 21:38.729
than with Westerville's 94th
annual pumpkin festival.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.432
People are already lining
up to Raatma the hay rides,

21:41.434 --> 21:43.067
apple Raatma, and of course,

21:43.069 --> 21:46.072
to see who will be crowned
the festival's largest Raatma.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.545
Okay, why don't we
cut to commercial...

21:54.547 --> 21:56.547
Jesus fucking Christ!

22:16.235 --> 22:17.802
And in sports news,

22:17.804 --> 22:20.871
Ohio state plays the Indiana
Hoosiers tomorrow night.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.707
Good luck to our Buckeyes.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.612
I'm Holly Marciano,
Channel Six News.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.647
Hail Raatma.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.692
These super
labs can be booby-trapped,

22:41.694 --> 22:43.728
proceed with caution.

22:43.730 --> 22:47.031
Could be no
one left alive in here.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.536
You feeling
in over your head, Nash?

22:50.770 --> 22:52.839
Mind your own
fucking head, Slater.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.155
I've got people,
there's people in here.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.724
Blue Team,
we've got more DBs.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.394
Room full of bodies.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.404
Fuck me, I'm
calling for backup.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.441
No, not yet, let's
find the others.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.810
Hey Slater, what's your 10-20?

23:32.812 --> 23:34.078
Fuck if I know.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.380
Oursler and I got
fucking separated.

23:36.382 --> 23:41.285
Could be these bitches are
barricaded or got tipped off.

23:41.287 --> 23:42.855
Stay where you are.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.293
You know, if this thing
ever makes the news,

23:48.528 --> 23:50.029
and they ask for an interview,

23:51.831 --> 23:53.633
I can do it, I
got a face for TV.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.288
So with
these memorial videos,

24:18.290 --> 24:21.158
isn't it usually just
like home movies?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.794
We record our services
from time to time.

24:23.796 --> 24:28.801
You haven't yet met the family
of the deceased, have you?

24:29.969 --> 24:32.002
They are, well,
the main point is

24:32.004 --> 24:34.539
we never question the
request of the client.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.874
Grief is a personal matter.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.109
If the bereaved family
wants to include footage

24:39.111 --> 24:42.381
of the wake in their memorial
video, we are happy to oblige.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.015
I assume they're
paying extra for this.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.217
That also, yes.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.220
Hand me the battery.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.423
I've got it to program
for the cameras as well,

24:53.425 --> 24:55.325
so make sure you
keep this in CD mode,

24:55.327 --> 24:56.561
otherwise you'll eject a tape

24:56.563 --> 24:58.295
in the middle of
someone's eulogy.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.598
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, I parked out front.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.633
The wake's going to begin
at nine, so I would suggest

25:02.635 --> 25:03.801
- you open the doors...
- Yeah, I already know.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.402
- Why's the casket crooked?
- Hm?

25:05.404 --> 25:08.405
I didn't place it like that.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.307
You know I didn't go near it.

25:10.309 --> 25:11.676
Maybe I bumped it.

25:11.678 --> 25:12.511
Whatever.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.283
Oh, Jesus, that's heavy.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.985
Well he was a big boy.

25:20.987 --> 25:23.420
Parts of him that
were left, anyway.

25:23.422 --> 25:24.622
Ronald, he's joking, right?

25:24.624 --> 25:27.357
The deceased was
in a severe accident.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.693
It is a closed casket wake.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.828
- Yeah, I knew that, but...
- Don't worry.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.229
I was more or less
able to get him back

25:32.231 --> 25:33.798
into his original shape.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.803
Pity about his face and head.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.737
But the family wanted
him to put back together,

25:39.739 --> 25:42.439
and aside from that top part,
I'd say it's pretty good work.

25:42.441 --> 25:43.674
But don't take my word for it,

25:43.676 --> 25:46.143
why don't you have
a look for yourself?

25:46.145 --> 25:47.645
You're gonna do great, Hailey.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.413
I'll be in early tomorrow
morning to relieve you,

25:49.415 --> 25:51.749
so if anything serious
comes up, give me a call.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.620
And if it doesn't,
don't wake me up.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.357
Yes, I was just
about to switch out the tapes,

26:33.359 --> 26:36.827
but I feel dumb recording
myself just sitting here.

26:36.829 --> 26:37.697
I'm standing.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.798
Call me if
anything serious came up.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.700
Nothing happening,
it's not serious.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.636
It's a wake, he's
not going anywhere.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.971
Maybe they got
caught in the storm,

26:46.973 --> 26:49.475
or maybe nobody liked the guy.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.244
Okay, okay, sorry.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.479
Hey Sharon, it's me.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.049
I know it's late,
but if you're up,

27:32.051 --> 27:33.953
give me a call it
the funeral home.

27:35.287 --> 27:40.059
No one's here and I'm
working all night,

27:41.694 --> 27:43.462
and I had a quick
question for you.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.331
Bye.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.469
Hello?

28:25.471 --> 28:27.073
I mean, Jensen Funeral Home.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.109
Hey, Sharon, yeah.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.479
Your mom still saves
the newspaper, right?

28:34.881 --> 28:36.380
No, I...

28:36.382 --> 28:38.048
No, that's fine.

28:38.050 --> 28:41.485
Listen, would you mind
checking the obituary page

28:41.487 --> 28:44.957
in the last few issues for
a guy named Andrew Edwards?

28:46.025 --> 28:48.125
This is weird, but I'm supposed

28:48.127 --> 28:50.229
to be hosting his
wake tonight, and I...

28:51.330 --> 28:53.230
Something like that.

28:53.232 --> 28:56.266
Basically, just
in the past week.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.103
Yeah.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.239
Thanks, I appreciate it.

29:01.507 --> 29:02.341
Bye.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.741
Shit, shit.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.523
It's crooked?

31:30.889 --> 31:33.924
I am fucking telling
you he's alive in there.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.825
He fucking moved, I heard it.

31:35.827 --> 31:39.065
I promise you,
he is very dead, Hailey.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.400
If you can't handle one
under-attended wake...

31:43.402 --> 31:44.503
Hang on, here's Tim.

31:48.240 --> 31:52.609
Hailey, kid, I assure
you that body in that casket

31:52.611 --> 31:54.611
is not capable of moving.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.280
All those stories
about people waking up

31:56.282 --> 31:58.082
are just urban legends.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.549
It's just gas is escaping

31:59.551 --> 32:02.019
or one of the other
hundred chemical processes

32:02.021 --> 32:04.488
that can happen with embalmed
remains in the first 96.

32:04.490 --> 32:06.290
We talked about this.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.659
Gas is escaping.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.194
It's just
you there, right?

32:10.196 --> 32:12.596
So go crack the lid
and take a peek.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.898
Seriously, I mean it, Ronnie
and I will stay on the line

32:14.900 --> 32:17.834
and you'll see it's
just a person's remains.

32:17.836 --> 32:19.203
Might look a little gross,

32:19.205 --> 32:21.440
but that's all it is,
and you'll feel better.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.109
Hailey?

32:25.111 --> 32:26.843
No, you're right.

32:26.845 --> 32:29.679
It's just the remains
settling, I know that.

32:29.681 --> 32:30.549
Sorry, Tim.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.817
It's okay, kid.

32:33.819 --> 32:36.420
But don't call here again
tonight or Ron will fire you.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.256
Goodnight.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.823
This is
Andrew's wake, no?

33:13.825 --> 33:14.958
Yes, yes.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.096
My gosh, I am so
sorry, wait one second.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.499
We had a power outage, so...

33:24.736 --> 33:29.173
We met with a man
before, an old fellow.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.607
He's not here tonight?

33:30.609 --> 33:33.210
Oh, you must mean
Ronald, he's the manager.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.745
He'll be in tomorrow for
the funeral services itself,

33:35.747 --> 33:38.315
but I was given the
responsibility of the wake.

33:38.317 --> 33:39.718
Doesn't matter.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.886
Of course, I understand
very few could make it up

33:42.888 --> 33:44.088
in this storm.

33:44.090 --> 33:48.292
There's a tornado watch,
something like this.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.495
I listen to the weather.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.562
May I?

33:52.564 --> 33:53.865
My gosh, yes.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.303
Here.

33:59.071 --> 34:00.806
Are you family, or...

34:52.056 --> 34:53.956
Thank you very much.

34:53.958 --> 34:55.724
Oh, do you need anything else?

34:55.726 --> 34:58.197
No, I paid
my respects in full.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.590
Janssen Funeral Home.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.860
Hey, sorry,
I totally passed out.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.428
Don't sweat it, it's cool.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.830
No one showed up to
this wake tonight.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.865
It's been kind of creepy,

35:35.867 --> 35:38.768
so I wanted to know the
deal with the dead guy,

35:38.770 --> 35:43.540
but someone finally visited,
so now it's not as strange.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.875
Really,
someone showed up?

35:45.877 --> 35:46.878
What were they like?

35:49.080 --> 35:50.347
Why?

35:50.349 --> 35:51.548
I went and flipped
through the Tribune

35:51.550 --> 35:53.217
for Andrew Edwards
like you said,

35:53.219 --> 35:55.319
but I didn't need to
look in the obituaries.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.586
He was on the front page.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.322
What?

35:58.324 --> 36:00.089
Andrew Edwards
is the name of the guy

36:00.091 --> 36:02.592
who jumped off the roof of
that church down in Haysburg.

36:02.594 --> 36:04.294
You heard about that, right?

36:04.296 --> 36:07.063
He was on the roof for an
hour shouting crazy gibberish,

36:07.065 --> 36:08.532
and then he hit
the concrete steps

36:08.534 --> 36:10.702
right as families were
beginning to show up for...

36:11.937 --> 36:13.972
Hello, Sharon?

36:24.483 --> 36:27.085
Hello?

36:46.004 --> 36:46.838
What?

37:04.623 --> 37:05.657
Mr. Edwards?

37:16.835 --> 37:20.737
Mr. Edwards, you've been
in an accident, okay?

37:20.739 --> 37:22.839
And there was...

37:22.841 --> 37:25.875
There's some kind of a
mistake at the morgue...

37:49.535 --> 37:51.301
He can't see me.

40:16.414 --> 40:19.483
Petro, we're on
the move, where are you?

40:21.520 --> 40:23.254
We're
fucking lost in here.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.525
Oh god, there's
that smell again.

40:27.459 --> 40:28.860
It's worse than dead bodies.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.663
This is not the
same staircase.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.904
Watch your step, there's
something on the floor.

40:49.715 --> 40:51.683
What the fuck is that?

40:52.818 --> 40:55.151
Petro, where the fuck are you?

40:55.153 --> 40:58.622
We've got another 419,
definitely not self-inflicted.

40:58.624 --> 41:01.390
We don't need more tech,
we need a gravedigger!

41:01.392 --> 41:02.992
We're gonna need more
than just one gravedigger.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.330
This is gonna get nastier.

41:06.464 --> 41:07.298
Petro!

41:09.234 --> 41:10.600
Oursler!

41:10.602 --> 41:12.569
Fucking radio isn't working.

41:12.571 --> 41:13.404
Petro, Oursler!

41:14.873 --> 41:17.607
All officers
check in right fucking now!

41:17.609 --> 41:20.810
With radio interference,
this channel is not stable.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.748
We have to find
an exit right now.

41:26.217 --> 41:28.585
All are welcome.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.920
All are watching.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.822
Finally, followers,

41:32.824 --> 41:35.925
tonight is the night
you've been waiting for.

41:35.927 --> 41:38.394
Track my signal.

41:38.396 --> 41:40.664
The signal is the stimulant.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.632
The signal is the sedative.

41:42.634 --> 41:45.070
The signal is salvation.

41:46.404 --> 41:48.607
Forever starts right now.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:44.521
Hello.

01:03:49.994 --> 01:03:50.827
Hello.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:24.294
Hey!

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:30.167
Hello.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:31.853
I, I thought you
promised no one would get hurt.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:32.755
Oh, Gary.

01:11:36.092 --> 01:11:37.960
Someone always gets hurt.

01:11:40.496 --> 01:11:42.964
What the fuck
is going on in there?

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.766
If you cannot clear
the fucking place,

01:11:44.768 --> 01:11:47.569
then get the fuck
out of there now!

01:11:47.571 --> 01:11:49.873
Forever starts right now.

01:11:54.478 --> 01:11:56.778
Is Spivy here with you, Nash?

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.312
He got separated.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:11:59.749
Haven't laid eyes on him.

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:05.319
I want to get the
fuck out of here.

01:12:07.255 --> 01:12:08.756
Spivy?

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:09.593
Spivy.

01:12:11.127 --> 01:12:13.397
Spivy, Oursler!

01:12:20.068 --> 01:12:20.904
Spivy?

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.106
Spivy!

01:12:25.541 --> 01:12:27.710
Fucking hate this place.

01:12:28.812 --> 01:12:29.913
Spivy, come in.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:32.680
Brayberry.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.517
Fisher.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.119
Fucking anybody, come in!

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:40.121
Try not to
lose your head, Slater.

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:56.806
Attention!

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:39.549
Oh god!

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.620
No, no.

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:45.989
No.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.834
No.

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:04.139
No.

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:07.010
God, no, please.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.447
I'm rolling.

01:14:14.751 --> 01:14:16.551
Okay, ready?

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:17.885
You can go.

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:20.822
Happy shall he be
that taketh and dashest

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:23.092
thy little ones
against the stone.

01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:35.672
Yep, cool.

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:49.684
America is plagued
by a black cancer

01:14:49.686 --> 01:14:53.087
that has been allowed to
rot this once great land

01:14:53.089 --> 01:14:55.422
from within for far too long.

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:58.860
We, the last decent
men of America,

01:14:58.862 --> 01:15:01.596
are the true patriots who
have given blood oaths

01:15:01.598 --> 01:15:03.998
to defend our way of life.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.601
We will take back America.

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:09.103
Its rapists will be
put down in the gutter.

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:12.940
We will put boots to them
and squash this mongrel horde

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:14.842
like the rats they are.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:18.746
We, the First Patriots Movement
Militia, are coming for you.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:23.150
Our time of mass
cleansing is at hand.

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:25.519
And with this weapon

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:28.322
that Christ himself
in his infinite wisdom

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:31.292
has seen fit to bestow upon us,

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:35.663
we have become likened unto
a righteous fist of justice

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:38.966
that will smite the wickedness
from the face of this earth!

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:40.935
- Yeah!
- The United States

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:43.738
- of Fuckdom will fall!
- Yeah!

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.372
By god!

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:51.345
Bob, what do I, I
got it on standby.

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:52.479
Now do I just press the button?

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:53.314
Press the red button.

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:54.548
Just press it, okay.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.083
I don't wanna press, I
don't wanna fuck it up.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:59.320
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, roll, roll, roll!

01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:00.924
Business, business time.

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:03.457
Jesus fuck!

01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:05.028
Thanks for the puddle, Steve.

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:10.732
Do you copy, we got a
dash on this building.

01:16:10.734 --> 01:16:14.301
Looks like a security
entrance to the east side.

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:17.404
Employee parking lot,
and it's not open today,

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.173
but guarantee on the
day it's gonna be open.

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.242
Copy that.

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:22.976
I'm looking at...

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.679
Got one security camera.

01:16:24.681 --> 01:16:27.148
Two security
camera, three, four.

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:30.752
We got definitely two X-ray
analyzers in the lobby,

01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:32.485
and maybe a retinal scan.

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:36.658
I'll try to get some codes,
but if I don't, shit, guys.

01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.894
That was final.

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:44.766
- Good job, good job.
- Good job.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:45.601
Okay.

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.535
We can maybe walk the beast in,

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:52.506
but I don't think they're open
until well after sun's out.

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.307
Does the front of the
building even get sunlight?

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:55.743
If we miss our
weather window now,

01:16:55.745 --> 01:16:57.712
we're not gonna get sunlight
for a few months, Bob.

01:16:57.714 --> 01:16:59.046
No, no, no,
no, we have to go now.

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:00.247
Maybe a bit drastic.

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.548
We have to go in
there and hit them up

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:03.851
when the building's
full up, okay?

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:05.119
Hell yeah.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.087
They got a daycare.

01:17:06.089 --> 01:17:07.056
They got a daycare.

01:17:10.727 --> 01:17:13.096
Okay, um, pull out.

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:16.430
Oh shit, front door it is.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:19.667
You know, at least the street
runs past there, right?

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:21.769
Oh, hang on a moment
here, Commandant, the...

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:22.970
Via loading dock.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:24.771
Oh, it's the
maintenance entrance,

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.273
my cousin can get
us the passcode.

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:29.744
Oh, nice, and the sun is
there most of the day, too.

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:36.717
Well, gentlemen, this
is where we roll in

01:17:36.719 --> 01:17:38.387
and we detonate the abomination.

01:18:05.882 --> 01:18:06.883
Good shot.

01:18:10.219 --> 01:18:12.319
Tower one
to eagle's nest.

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:15.122
Go for eagle's nest.

01:18:15.124 --> 01:18:16.323
Package has landed.

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:17.827
Copy that, tower one.

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:29.237
Hope you weren't waiting long.

01:18:30.974 --> 01:18:33.009
Work as much, but
there's plenty of it.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:37.112
Greg.

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:43.384
Gotta say, you boys
don't fool around.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:46.087
I'm very impressed
with the security here.

01:18:46.089 --> 01:18:47.521
Dam right, we're tight as
a fucking drum, all right?

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:50.357
Shut the fuck up, Jimmy,
you're out of order.

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:51.761
My bad, sorry, Commandant.

01:18:53.196 --> 01:18:55.298
Well trained soldiers
you got there, Greg.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:59.903
It's Air Commandant
when we're in uniform.

01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:02.939
Copy that, Air Commandant.

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:08.244
Now your unit may be a
well-regulated militia.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.483
But you ain't nowhere
near well armed enough

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.453
for the very necessary fight
you've got coming your way.

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:22.289
My god, this is making
my fucking dick hard.

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:24.557
This is making
all our dicks hard.

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:26.260
Yeah, Bob, I
can see it from here.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:27.694
This will be more than enough

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:29.931
to hold off whatever authorities
come at you after the op.

01:19:29.933 --> 01:19:31.164
Now if those Waco numbnuts

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:33.000
would have had half
this hardware on hand,

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:35.101
ATF would still be out
there getting chewed up.

01:19:35.103 --> 01:19:36.403
Bet you these were
just drinking up

01:19:36.405 --> 01:19:38.105
- that fucking Iraqi blood, huh?
- Oh fuck yeah!

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.673
Fucking Desert Storm!

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:41.275
Oy, desert buttfuck, Talon!

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.476
No one at the police station

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:44.711
saw you taking
any of this stuff?

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:45.980
Nope.

01:19:45.982 --> 01:19:47.481
How's that?

01:19:47.483 --> 01:19:49.018
We got friends everywhere.

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:51.685
You know it.

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:53.619
Especially with a grease
stain like Clinton

01:19:53.621 --> 01:19:55.689
in the White House.

01:19:55.691 --> 01:19:58.392
Lots of cops are
ready for you patriots

01:19:58.394 --> 01:20:01.330
to take the feds down, hard.

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:08.101
Could you say
something, Air Commandant,

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.503
about how momentous this
moment is for the cause?

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:11.773
With the weapons and all.

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:14.844
Cut.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:30.093
This is but a earthly arsenal.

01:20:40.904 --> 01:20:42.271
Well met, fellow warrior.

01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:44.673
This man here...

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:49.243
This man heard Wu Tan's
clarion call to action

01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:50.313
and he did his part.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:54.715
He hath armed us for
conflict sure to come

01:20:54.717 --> 01:20:58.351
after the heroic act that
we have all given blood oath

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:00.054
to undertake.

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:04.926
We will topple the Patrick
V. McNamara Federal Building

01:21:04.928 --> 01:21:07.728
in the infested cesspit
of Detroit, Michigan.

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.232
- Fuck yeah.
- Fucking right.

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.868
And you're
certain the weapon works?

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:14.803
The creature?

01:21:15.771 --> 01:21:16.605
Of course.

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:19.407
So you tested it?

01:21:28.317 --> 01:21:32.153
Someone turn off
that fucking bell!

01:21:32.155 --> 01:21:33.722
- There.
- Please, no.

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:35.624
Please.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:39.327
Please.

01:21:40.696 --> 01:21:41.530
Please.

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:51.107
Jimmy.

01:21:57.713 --> 01:21:59.080
Bucket.

01:21:59.082 --> 01:22:01.983
Come on, take that bit.

01:22:01.985 --> 01:22:03.417
Don't get any on you,

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:03.987
you don't know what that
shit's gonna do to your scent.

01:22:06.522 --> 01:22:07.456
Yeah, drain him.

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:09.692
Come on, bitch.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:12.061
Yeah, here we go.

01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:15.429
That's probably good enough.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:17.198
Pretty cool eyes.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:18.599
This one looks pretty cool.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:19.666
Kinda evil looking.

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:21.135
Oh shit, those coyotes?

01:22:21.137 --> 01:22:22.636
Yeah.

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:24.905
Okay, let's do this.

01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:25.741
Good girl.

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.143
Good girl.

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:31.712
Okay, Phoebe, this
is the good stuff.

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:35.016
This is to redeem the soul
of the goddamn US of A.

01:22:35.018 --> 01:22:36.383
- Oh yeah.
- You understand me?

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:38.519
Okay, get this for posterity,
can you focus this?

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.087
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, let's get that.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.722
- Got it?
- Let's do this, yeah.

01:22:41.724 --> 01:22:44.860
Creature blood going
in, three, two, one.

01:22:49.832 --> 01:22:51.632
Say something,
Air Commandant,

01:22:51.634 --> 01:22:53.636
on what we're doing here.

01:22:55.038 --> 01:22:58.372
Well, uh, I got
to thinking, Bob,

01:22:58.374 --> 01:22:59.940
that it would probably
be a good idea

01:22:59.942 --> 01:23:03.677
to test the ultimate weapon
before we're fully committed

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:05.878
and running the mission.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.282
Smart, really smart.

01:23:09.618 --> 01:23:11.154
What's taking him so...

01:23:12.388 --> 01:23:13.587
Oh shit.

01:23:13.589 --> 01:23:15.556
Shit, here we go, here
we go, here we go.

01:23:15.558 --> 01:23:17.724
Run, boy, the sun is coming up!

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:18.861
Everyone down, down!

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:37.813
What in the actual fuck?

01:23:38.746 --> 01:23:40.314
- Jimmy!
- What?

01:23:40.316 --> 01:23:43.350
It's probably blocked
by the tree or something!

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.319
Get in there, don't
be such a fucking...

01:23:52.395 --> 01:23:54.860
Fucking Christ.

01:24:00.469 --> 01:24:02.836
First martyrs
of the cause, baby!

01:24:02.838 --> 01:24:04.371
- It happened, it worked!
- It's gone!

01:24:04.373 --> 01:24:05.672
- What'd you say?
- It's gone!

01:24:05.674 --> 01:24:07.441
- What?
- Phoebe!

01:24:07.443 --> 01:24:09.077
- It's gone!
- It works!

01:24:15.818 --> 01:24:17.684
Fuck you!

01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:18.521
Yeah!

01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:21.588
This fucking smoke!

01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:36.570
All right, I give
the go-ahead, and...

01:24:36.572 --> 01:24:38.874
And fucking boom!

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:46.915
Um...

01:24:48.916 --> 01:24:50.784
Fuck, Chuck, one second.

01:24:50.786 --> 01:24:53.187
- Fuck.
- Sorry, sorry.

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:54.621
They have to all go
down at the same time,

01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:56.056
- otherwise these fucking...
- Sensor's just not

01:24:56.058 --> 01:24:57.858
fucking going, Greg, I
don't know what's going on.

01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:00.661
Well then you go and
you get the part tomorrow.

01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:02.831
Guess what, we're going
the day after now.

01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:05.999
Fuck!

01:25:06.001 --> 01:25:07.668
Nothing can be left to chance,

01:25:07.670 --> 01:25:10.173
we are stepping onto
the world stage here.

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:14.643
God in his infinite wisdom has
given us a boon for the ages.

01:25:15.978 --> 01:25:20.483
A metaphysical super
weapon, living destruction.

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:26.955
I will not let
Christ the King down.

01:25:30.326 --> 01:25:33.960
We must do his good
work with honor!

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:34.797
Yes, sir.

01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:42.303
Well it looks like
it's one more day

01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:46.575
until the fall of the
unholy American Empire.

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.847
But tonight,

01:25:53.782 --> 01:25:56.318
tonight we will send off proper.

01:25:57.753 --> 01:26:02.155
We will cleanse ourselves
before the retribution.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:06.228
We will get cork
high and bottle deep!

01:26:09.865 --> 01:26:11.932
We're gonna get fucking wasted.

01:26:11.934 --> 01:26:13.166
Yeah!

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.269
All right, yeah!

01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:18.572
- Fucking...
- Commandant's private stash!

01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:19.940
Oh, get it!

01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:28.882
You gonna go piss?

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:30.182
- A piss?
- You taking a piss?

01:26:30.184 --> 01:26:31.985
Are you gonna come
watch me take a piss?

01:26:31.987 --> 01:26:33.387
Yeah, you
want me to film it,

01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:34.955
- you fucking perv?
- Yeah, fucking go ahead.

01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:36.990
Hey, we're going to
the pissing hole!

01:26:36.992 --> 01:26:40.294
- No, never rest, only pee!
- Yeah.

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:41.129
- Never rest, only pee!
- Only pee.

01:26:45.834 --> 01:26:49.235
Holy, ah, I tell you.

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:50.637
Fucking...

01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:53.173
Let me tell
you, these were fucking,

01:26:53.175 --> 01:26:55.141
these are $12.

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:57.610
Oh, Jessie, what the fuck?

01:26:57.612 --> 01:26:59.946
- I'll get, I'll get you.
- Oh shit!

01:26:59.948 --> 01:27:01.982
I know how to use this.

01:27:01.984 --> 01:27:04.585
Oy, oy, oy, you're good.

01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:09.256
Bob, we need you, Bob!

01:27:09.258 --> 01:27:11.557
- You need a drink, Bob.
- Bob's out!

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.094
- You need a drink.
- Bob!

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:16.797
Give it to him.

01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:19.164
Your
camera is your mask.

01:27:19.166 --> 01:27:21.234
- Camera is my mask?
- Why don't you have a drink?

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.735
You're wearing
a literal mask.

01:27:22.737 --> 01:27:24.204
- You have to have...
- I will have a drink.

01:27:24.206 --> 01:27:26.940
- A drink.
- I've been working hard.

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:29.175
- Oh, you first.
- You know what?

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:30.012
You're sick.

01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:43.392
Ow, ow.

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.632
There he is.

01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:52.335
Fucking fuck.

01:27:56.839 --> 01:27:58.005
Fucking pussy.

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:01.477
Steve.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.355
Steve.

01:28:14.357 --> 01:28:16.392
Where's the fucking monster?

01:28:23.332 --> 01:28:24.933
Let's fuck with him, man.

01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:27.803
- What?
- Let's fuck with him.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.771
You don't...

01:28:30.773 --> 01:28:32.305
You don't wanna piss on him?

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.841
The fuck, Bob, what the
fuck is wrong with you, man?

01:28:34.843 --> 01:28:36.677
The fuck
is wrong with you?

01:28:36.679 --> 01:28:39.846
Bob, just go back to the
fucking party, man, okay?

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:43.517
Let me do my thing, you go,
get the fuck out of here.

01:28:43.519 --> 01:28:44.353
The fuck?

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:50.190
Pussy, I fucking knew you'd
pussy out, you little bitch.

01:28:50.192 --> 01:28:51.894
Fucking Steve.

01:28:54.397 --> 01:28:57.297
Welcome to romance hour.

01:29:02.004 --> 01:29:03.770
Oh, oh, wow.

01:29:03.772 --> 01:29:05.508
Give him a kiss.

01:29:06.775 --> 01:29:08.043
- What?
- Kiss him!

01:29:11.547 --> 01:29:12.579
You fucking dare me?

01:29:12.581 --> 01:29:13.449
Fucking do it!

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:16.719
Fucking French him!

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:26.793
Oh my god.

01:29:26.795 --> 01:29:28.294
Give me that fucking thing.

01:29:28.296 --> 01:29:30.831
No, no, no, no, no.

01:29:30.833 --> 01:29:33.769
Bob!

01:29:37.239 --> 01:29:38.639
Oh god!

01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:40.441
You sick fuck!

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:47.850
Is that you?

01:29:49.151 --> 01:29:50.751
- What the fuck?
- Go, go, go!

01:29:50.753 --> 01:29:52.018
- Wait, who the fuck...
- Who's that with Bart?

01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:54.189
- I don't know.
- Who's on fucking duty?

01:29:55.458 --> 01:29:57.390
- Who's on duty?
- It's supposed to be me.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.525
- I'm sorry!
- What the fuck?

01:29:58.527 --> 01:29:59.726
I'm sorry,
Commandant, I'll fix it!

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:01.263
- Oh, fuck.
- Go!

01:30:02.565 --> 01:30:03.830
- What are you doing?
- I'll fix it!

01:30:03.832 --> 01:30:07.367
Who the fuck is that,
who the fuck is that?

01:30:07.369 --> 01:30:09.869
The fuck is that thing?

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:10.806
Is that Terry?

01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:15.776
- Is that Terry?
- Terry?

01:30:15.778 --> 01:30:18.211
- Who is that?
- Terry's fucking dead!

01:30:18.213 --> 01:30:19.214
Oh my god.

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:23.818
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:30:28.924 --> 01:30:29.958
Terry's fucking dead.

01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:35.360
Do not fire until
I give the order!

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:43.739
Who, who are we missing?

01:30:45.641 --> 01:30:46.940
- Um...
- Who?

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:48.642
- Fucking Reed.
- Steve.

01:30:48.644 --> 01:30:50.378
Steve was on desk last night.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:52.913
Has anyone seen him?

01:30:52.915 --> 01:30:55.414
Steve, is that you, boy?

01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:03.857
What the fuck!

01:31:03.859 --> 01:31:05.958
Stop, wait!

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.928
Wait, stop, stop, fucking wait!

01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:09.062
Fucking wait,

01:31:09.064 --> 01:31:10.864
take your hands off the trigger!

01:31:13.335 --> 01:31:18.340
Fucking...

01:31:19.074 --> 01:31:21.510
Judas fucking Priest!

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.110
- Greg?
- Steve!

01:31:24.112 --> 01:31:27.012
Steve, no, stop, stop,
you fucking idiot!

01:31:27.014 --> 01:31:29.349
You're covered in vampire blood!

01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:31.251
Stop moving, no, no, no, no!

01:31:36.659 --> 01:31:39.094
Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve!

01:31:42.898 --> 01:31:44.330
Come on, Greg.

01:31:44.332 --> 01:31:46.266
Mother fuck.

01:31:46.268 --> 01:31:48.467
Fuck, fuck this
evil abomination.

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:49.770
We are gonna go in there

01:31:49.772 --> 01:31:51.672
and we're gonna take
this creature down.

01:31:51.674 --> 01:31:53.273
We don't get in
there before sundown,

01:31:53.275 --> 01:31:54.708
we're not gonna be able
to do nothing noways.

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:57.778
This fucking thing's
unstoppable at night, come on.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.282
Well then lock
and fucking load then.

01:32:11.594 --> 01:32:12.427
Move in!

01:32:15.798 --> 01:32:17.831
Dude, what the fuck
was that, what the fuck?

01:32:23.505 --> 01:32:26.108
Over here, come here.

01:32:32.447 --> 01:32:33.614
Fuck!

01:32:33.616 --> 01:32:35.481
- Oh shit, fuck.
- What?

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:36.318
Fuck.

01:32:37.219 --> 01:32:39.321
Fucking thing, holy shit.

01:32:43.225 --> 01:32:44.059
Go.

01:32:45.227 --> 01:32:47.630
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:33:20.295 --> 01:33:21.129
Clear!

01:33:23.632 --> 01:33:25.365
Whoa, whoa!

01:33:25.367 --> 01:33:26.967
Oh fuck!

01:33:26.969 --> 01:33:28.333
Oh god!

01:33:28.335 --> 01:33:30.570
Oh my god, Tom!

01:33:30.572 --> 01:33:33.606
What the fuck!

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:38.612
Jesus Christ!

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.081
I think we got him.

01:33:41.083 --> 01:33:42.382
Shit.

01:33:42.384 --> 01:33:43.451
Get up there!

01:34:06.308 --> 01:34:08.408
Shit!

01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:09.776
- Greg!
- My leg, my leg!

01:34:09.778 --> 01:34:11.845
Fuck!

01:34:11.847 --> 01:34:14.047
No, no, no!

01:34:14.049 --> 01:34:18.418
Shit!

01:34:18.420 --> 01:34:19.652
My leg!

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:24.392
Okay, okay, okay.

01:35:03.598 --> 01:35:05.899
Christ is king,
Christ is king, Christ.

01:35:05.901 --> 01:35:09.169
Christ is king, Christ
is king, Christ is king,

01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:10.636
Christ, Christ is king.

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:14.039
Christ is king, Christ is
king, Christ, Christ is king.

01:35:14.041 --> 01:35:17.643
Christ is king, Christ
is king, Christ is king,

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:20.914
Christ, Christ, Christ
is king, Christ is king.

01:35:20.916 --> 01:35:23.616
Christ is
king, Christ is king.

01:35:23.618 --> 01:35:28.623
Christ is king!

01:35:49.978 --> 01:35:52.578
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.948
Get me out of here, god damn it!

01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:57.217
God can't
help you now, Slater.

01:35:57.219 --> 01:35:59.319
Didn't you see that
last videotape?

01:35:59.321 --> 01:36:01.556
I saw you in that last tape.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:04.891
Slater's got some
explaining to do.

01:36:04.893 --> 01:36:06.761
We've got some
explaining to do.

01:36:08.063 --> 01:36:10.163
Fucking untie me!

01:36:10.165 --> 01:36:12.400
We're lost in here
with fucking junkies.

01:36:13.568 --> 01:36:15.802
You still think
this is a drug ring?

01:36:15.804 --> 01:36:17.670
It's our videotapes
that are the villain.

01:36:17.672 --> 01:36:20.640
Our videotapes are
gonna fuck you up.

01:36:20.642 --> 01:36:22.077
It's more like a trance.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:29.715
Are you telling me that Spivy

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.885
is in a fucking trance!

01:36:31.887 --> 01:36:33.854
No, Spivy's dead.

01:36:38.493 --> 01:36:40.395
What the fuck is all of this?

01:36:41.529 --> 01:36:45.298
This is a far out
fetish film cult

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:49.269
of bootleggers pushing that
untouched, untouchable,

01:36:49.271 --> 01:36:51.704
nastiest of the nasties.

01:36:51.706 --> 01:36:55.307
Snuffing and fluffing,
cannibals, animals.

01:36:55.309 --> 01:36:58.945
Girls in white suits
fucking shit up!

01:36:58.947 --> 01:37:02.883
We deal in contraband
content, strictly VHS.

01:37:02.885 --> 01:37:03.952
Definitely illegal.

01:37:05.253 --> 01:37:06.987
Oh my god, I didn't
think we'd get busted

01:37:06.989 --> 01:37:08.590
by our own useless unit.

01:37:14.296 --> 01:37:17.663
Are you
ready for your closeup?

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.900
What the fuck
did you just say?

01:37:19.902 --> 01:37:21.734
We are the final girls.

01:37:21.736 --> 01:37:23.303
You're our final kill.

01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:53.166
Some help here, Nash?

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:55.337
My camera's fucking stuck!

01:38:15.557 --> 01:38:17.923
This tape's
gonna be our best one yet.

01:38:17.925 --> 01:38:19.261
Fans are gonna go crazy.

01:38:21.964 --> 01:38:23.130
What should we call it?

01:39:56.901 --> 01:40:01.901
