SGT. JJ SEFTON [on TV]:
'Cause we're busting out
of this stink hole

00:05.701 --> 00:08.486
in exactly one minute
and 20 seconds.

00:09.966 --> 00:11.794
Want some brandy?Yeah.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.578
Who doesn't?
Suppose we wait

00:13.622 --> 00:14.971
till we hit the Waldorf Astoria.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.494
[sound of dogs barking]

00:18.279 --> 00:19.497
It's on me.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.977
You won't
get off that cheap.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.457
Higgy.
What's up?

00:22.500 --> 00:24.720
The guest house is dark
and the Ferrari is gone.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.635
And you missing me?And the intercom

00:26.678 --> 00:28.202
at the front gate
is still broken.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.160
Did you ever call Rick's friend
to get it repaired?

00:30.204 --> 00:32.467
I did... not.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.772
Sorry about that.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.252
I'll do it first thing
in the morning, okay?

00:35.296 --> 00:36.514
DUNBAR:
What are the chances
of busting out of here?

00:36.558 --> 00:38.081
Is that Stalag 17I'm hearing?

00:38.125 --> 00:39.735
It is, indeed.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.171
That... Impressive.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.391
Where are you?Currently...

00:43.434 --> 00:46.089
I'm at the Makai Hotel's
luxurious honeymoon suite,

00:46.133 --> 00:49.179
having the most amazing
ice cream sundae I've ever had.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.399
You cannot seriously
be using that suite.

00:51.442 --> 00:54.619
Why not? They gave it
to us for free.Under false pretenses.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.839
Yeah, but they wanted us
to have it.Because we were pretending

00:56.882 --> 00:58.449
to be a couple
whose reservation was lost

00:58.493 --> 01:01.104
so that you could gain access
to their computer system.

01:01.148 --> 01:03.454
What was I supposed to do--
not use it, let it go to waste?

01:03.498 --> 01:05.935
You really don't see anything
wrong with this, do you?

01:05.978 --> 01:07.415
Look, I have an important
meeting with a client

01:07.458 --> 01:09.504
in the morning
and I-I don't want

01:09.547 --> 01:10.548
to drive all the way downtown.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.159
That is not an excuse, Magnum.

01:12.202 --> 01:13.464
Well, I-I can't leave now,

01:13.508 --> 01:14.770
I already left
a five-star review.

01:14.813 --> 01:17.425
I-I talked about the room,
the service,

01:17.468 --> 01:19.166
the sundae...
Plus that

01:19.209 --> 01:21.429
super awesome Japanese toilet
that does...

01:21.472 --> 01:22.995
everything for you, you know?

01:23.039 --> 01:25.302
Plus, there's a bunch of stuff
I haven't even tried yet.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.870
If I leave now,
it will all be a lie.

01:27.913 --> 01:30.699
You lied to get the room.

01:30.742 --> 01:33.180
No, welied to get the room.

01:33.223 --> 01:34.790
[alarm blaring]

01:34.833 --> 01:35.965
Hey, what's going on?

01:38.533 --> 01:40.448
It appears there's an intruder
on the property.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.885
You seeing anybody
on the surveillance system?

01:42.928 --> 01:44.626
[dial tone]

01:44.669 --> 01:47.411
Higgins.
Higgins!

01:47.455 --> 01:49.457
♪

02:16.527 --> 02:18.529
♪

02:43.293 --> 02:44.468
Higgins?

02:44.512 --> 02:47.558
It's okay, it's okay.[man groans]

02:47.602 --> 02:49.691
You shoot the intruder
and then you tend to his wounds?

02:49.734 --> 02:51.823
The wound came with me,
I'm afraid.

02:51.867 --> 02:53.521
It's all right, Magnum.
This is an old friend

02:53.564 --> 02:54.913
from back in the MI6 days.

02:54.957 --> 02:58.134
Had to, uh, jump the gate
because someone

02:58.178 --> 02:59.701
didn't fix the intercom.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.485
IAN:
Ian Pryce.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.618
Hope you don't mind
if I don't get up.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.142
Magnum's a private investigator,
he lives in the guest house.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.535
This Kalo poultice

03:07.578 --> 03:10.059
is my Auntie Keona's
go-to remedy.

03:10.102 --> 03:11.843
It should help with
the bleeding, after.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.454
After what?

03:13.497 --> 03:15.934
The bullet is still in his leg
and we have to remove it.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.632
Yeah, this man needs a hospital.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.329
No, no.
No hospitals.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.375
Bullet wounds get reported
to the authorities.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.072
And that is a bad thing why?

03:23.115 --> 03:24.682
HIGGINS:
Ian is here unofficially.
He's on a personal mission

03:24.726 --> 03:27.119
that's unsanctioned by MI6.

03:27.163 --> 03:29.948
Unsanctioned.
Oh, illegal. Great.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.080
What's the mission?

03:31.123 --> 03:32.603
Actually, we haven't
got that far yet.

03:32.647 --> 03:35.693
Although I am starting
to become rather curious myself.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.218
Perhaps you'd care to share.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.180
You can trust them.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.532
It's about Viper, Jules.

03:48.576 --> 03:51.361
An analyst in the
Far East office

03:51.405 --> 03:52.536
picked up some chatter.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.191
There's a person
on-on this island

03:55.235 --> 03:57.802
who claims to have information
about Viper's identity

03:57.846 --> 03:59.456
and they're offering it
to the highest bidder.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.893
Who's Viper?

04:01.937 --> 04:03.982
He's an assassin.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.636
We've been chasing
him for years.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.291
Viper's responsible
for the deaths

04:08.335 --> 04:10.293
of a number
of Western assets

04:10.337 --> 04:12.817
and other high-value
targets, but, uh...

04:12.861 --> 04:16.299
we've never been able to put
a name or a face to him.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.475
And I'm guessing

04:18.519 --> 04:20.390
you have some connection
with this guy.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.175
He, uh...

04:26.483 --> 04:28.398
He murdered the man I loved.

04:40.454 --> 04:41.498
[Ian groaning] HIGGINS: Hang on.

04:41.542 --> 04:44.414
Steady.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.850
Deep breath.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.853
Oh!

04:51.682 --> 04:53.031
Ooh.

04:53.075 --> 04:54.424
[chuckles]

04:55.469 --> 04:57.384
Okay, now your turn.Yeah.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.342
The, uh...

04:59.386 --> 05:02.127
person who can apparently
ID Viper is one...

05:02.171 --> 05:03.477
Fiona Mahoe.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.828
A local woman who peddles
stolen intelligence.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.699
Government secrets.

05:08.743 --> 05:10.962
She's rather like
WikiLeaks, except...

05:11.006 --> 05:13.225
she's in it for money.
Using a false identity,

05:13.269 --> 05:16.403
I went to visit Fiona
this evening

05:16.446 --> 05:18.579
to negotiate a price, but, uh,

05:18.622 --> 05:20.581
she sussed out
that I was MI6,

05:20.624 --> 05:22.757
and let's just say she didn't
appreciate being lied to.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.542
Actually, I was fortunate
to get away

05:25.586 --> 05:26.761
with just one
bullet wound.

05:26.804 --> 05:28.502
And where is
this Fiona Mahoe?

05:28.545 --> 05:31.156
She operates out of a warehouse
in, uh, Kalihi.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.332
Hope I'm saying that right.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.376
You nailed it.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.552
And how many men are with her?

05:35.596 --> 05:36.553
At least three.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.512
All armed?To the teeth.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.210
KUMU:
I think

05:41.253 --> 05:43.386
Mr. Pryce could use
some rest right now.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.215
Magnum, can I have
a word with you?

05:46.258 --> 05:47.564
Yeah.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.572
You're gonna go see
this Fiona woman, aren't you?

05:55.616 --> 05:57.922
If she has information
on the Viper,

05:57.966 --> 05:59.881
we have to know what it is.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.274
We may never
get this opportunity again.

06:02.318 --> 06:04.102
Now,

06:04.146 --> 06:07.062
about all these favors that I've
been doing for you recently...

06:07.105 --> 06:08.324
Sure.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.543
I'll help.

06:09.586 --> 06:12.023
Oh. Well, uh...

06:12.067 --> 06:13.416
that was easy.

06:15.026 --> 06:18.508
Uh, don't you have to see a new
client in the morning, or...

06:18.552 --> 06:20.205
This seems important.

06:20.249 --> 06:23.513
Can you really afford
to lose out on this job?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.123
No.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.473
But, uh...

06:26.516 --> 06:28.344
I'll figure it out.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.526
KAMEKONA:
What's up, Mr. M?

06:36.570 --> 06:38.528
Want your usual--
spicy garlic?

06:38.572 --> 06:40.704
Not right now, Kame,
I'm working a case.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.533
Hello there.Donald Stolper.
My wife, Lauren.

06:43.577 --> 06:45.535
The pleasure is all mine.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.669
Thank you for meeting us,
Mr. Magnum.

06:48.712 --> 06:51.976
Please... call me Tommy.

06:56.503 --> 06:58.461
You sure he bought it?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.245
[chuckles]
Completely.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.160
I think I do a better you
than you do.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.511
And the job?Piece of cake.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.816
Client's daughter just announced

07:05.860 --> 07:08.340
that she wants to marry
the boyfriend next week.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.473
He's freaking out, wants me
to run a check on the guy,

07:10.517 --> 07:12.519
make sure he's not
a psycho or anything.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.346
You just got to make sure
he doesn't have

07:14.390 --> 07:16.261
an arrest record, uh, run
a background check on the guy...

07:16.305 --> 07:18.481
Tommy. Baby. I got this.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.483
Okay. I'll call you later.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.180
All right.

07:24.008 --> 07:26.228
So, we need to talk about
what we're gonna do

07:26.271 --> 07:27.925
when we get to Fiona's place.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.232
We got to have a plan going in.
We can't just walk in there

07:30.275 --> 07:32.539
and say we're buyers interested
in the Viper's identity

07:32.582 --> 07:35.063
after the shootout last night.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.586
There's no way she'd see us.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.805
Agreed.

07:37.848 --> 07:38.806
So how do you
want to play this?

07:38.849 --> 07:40.634
We can pose as sellers.

07:40.677 --> 07:43.027
Say that we're in possession
of state secrets.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.986
That could work,
but you got to lose the accent.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.684
Uh, Fiona and her crew
just shot at a Brit yesterday,

07:47.728 --> 07:49.599
a Brit comes in...

07:49.643 --> 07:50.600
that could make them jumpy.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.384
[American accent]:
Copy that.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.082
Losing the accent.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.562
[scoffs]

08:06.181 --> 08:07.269
You shouldn't be here.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.184
Which one of
you is Fiona?

08:11.708 --> 08:13.623
Okay, I guess
none of you are.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.146
Where can we find her?

08:15.190 --> 08:16.931
There's no Fiona here.HIGGINS: Tell her we have

08:16.974 --> 08:18.889
details about
a false flag operation

08:18.933 --> 08:21.588
ordered by Arturo Palli.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.372
I don't know what your...[comm crackles]

08:23.415 --> 08:24.416
Yes.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.201
Understood.

08:26.244 --> 08:27.855
Fiona will see you.

08:35.776 --> 08:36.559
He's clean.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.430
Clear.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.171
[door opens, closes]

08:41.216 --> 08:43.392
Arturo Palli.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.526
You sure know how
to get my attention.

08:46.569 --> 08:49.050
But first, can I ask
who referred you to me?

08:49.093 --> 08:50.747
[English accent]: We were
referred by the gentleman

08:50.791 --> 08:52.880
from last night and we want
the same thing he did.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.447
Uh, whoa.
Relax, guys.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.625
And I suppose you're also MI6?

08:58.668 --> 09:00.627
Hardly. Look,

09:00.670 --> 09:02.585
we don't want
any trouble.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.719
All we want
is your intel on Viper.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.242
Name your price.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.940
I'm sorry, but that information
is no longer for sale.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.855
See them out.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.510
[grunting]

09:19.646 --> 09:21.082
It didn't have
to go this way.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.563
Just tell me
what you have on Viper.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.868
Sweetheart, I have been
threatened by people

09:24.912 --> 09:25.869
a lot scarier than...

09:25.913 --> 09:27.915
Oh!

09:27.958 --> 09:29.612
Next I'll take your ear off.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.571
And you can guess
where we go from there.

09:31.614 --> 09:33.355
Who the hell are you?

09:33.398 --> 09:34.835
Who we are is unimportant.

09:34.878 --> 09:37.838
Just give us
the information.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.840
Please.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.628
I have a source
who stumbled onto

09:45.672 --> 09:46.847
a Cayman Islands bank account.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.588
There's strong evidence

09:48.631 --> 09:50.938
to suggest it's controlled
by Viper.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.593
I want specifics.
I want the name of the bank.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.420
What's the
account number?

09:55.464 --> 09:57.640
My source hasn't given me
those details.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.511
Look, I-I'm just a broker.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.165
People come to me
with information

10:01.209 --> 10:03.646
and I help them monetize it
in exchange for a cut.

10:03.690 --> 10:04.995
In this case,

10:05.039 --> 10:06.867
my source was only
gonna reveal the details

10:06.910 --> 10:09.086
of that account
after the received payment.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.479
But after what happened
last night,

10:10.522 --> 10:12.220
they got skittish
and backed out.

10:12.263 --> 10:14.439
That's why the information
is no longer up for sale.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.398
I want the name of your source.

10:16.441 --> 10:17.573
I don't know that either.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.270
I swear.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.751
We communicate electronically,

10:21.795 --> 10:24.188
but their intel is always good.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.975
HIGGINS:
All Fiona could give us

10:28.018 --> 10:29.759
was her source's
IP address.

10:29.803 --> 10:32.588
Well, having the details
of that Cayman Islands account

10:32.632 --> 10:34.372
would be a tremendous lead.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.853
We could trace it back
to Viper and finally ID him.

10:36.897 --> 10:38.115
Agreed.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.552
But first we need
to ID Fiona's source.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.990
Do you think you'd
be able to manage that?

10:43.033 --> 10:44.469
If not, we'll find them
another way.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.777
Funny.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.692
That's the Juliet I know.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.608
This majordomo
living in paradise--

10:52.652 --> 10:54.436
that person's a stranger to me.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.264
Who was he?

10:58.266 --> 10:59.920
The man she lost?

10:59.963 --> 11:02.444
I suggest you ask her that.

11:02.487 --> 11:03.880
I'm asking you.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.537
His name was Richard Dane.

11:08.580 --> 11:11.714
I recruited him out of Oxford.
He was my protégé.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.716
He was on assignment
in Istanbul,

11:13.760 --> 11:16.327
attempting to
track down Viper, but...

11:16.371 --> 11:18.895
unfortunately,
Viper was waiting for him.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.071
Richard's body was washed up
on the banks of the Bosporus

11:21.115 --> 11:22.551
a week later.

11:22.594 --> 11:25.641
That's when, uh,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.252
that's when Juliet went rogue,
as they say.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.733
She tried to hunt down
Viper on her own,

11:30.777 --> 11:33.562
ignoring any recall orders
from her superiors.

11:33.605 --> 11:37.131
Her attempt to avenge Richard
led to her being disavowed.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.743
Which is ironic, in retrospect.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.353
Ironic how?

11:42.397 --> 11:45.400
Against my advice,

11:45.443 --> 11:49.360
Juliet and Richard had made
plans to resign from MI6.

11:49.404 --> 11:52.712
They were gonna be married,
start a family,

11:52.755 --> 11:54.714
just a week
before he was killed.

12:03.418 --> 12:05.768
I've traced the location
of the source's I.P. address.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.597
Let me guess--
the public library.

12:08.640 --> 12:09.990
Try the Taipei consulate.

12:10.033 --> 12:11.992
The I.P. is assigned to
a government computer there.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.211
Unfortunately,
there is no way of knowing

12:14.255 --> 12:16.431
which of the 75 people
who work at the consulate

12:16.474 --> 12:18.650
is the primary user
of that particular computer.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.218
Any way you can access
the computer's webcam?

12:21.262 --> 12:24.352
That's not a bad idea.
Yes, of course I can.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.138
Is there anything
in the background

12:28.182 --> 12:29.749
that can help ID this guy?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.796
Doesn't appear to be.

12:33.840 --> 12:34.884
Oh, hello.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.759
Come on, show your face.

12:42.065 --> 12:43.588
We don't have time for this.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.025
May-Maybe you can
lure him over.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.810
Can you send, uh, like,
a "whoosh" sound or a chime?

12:47.854 --> 12:49.681
Like the kind you get
when you're getting an e-mail.

12:49.725 --> 12:50.944
Yeah.

12:50.987 --> 12:53.424
That's brilliant.Well, if it works.

12:53.468 --> 12:54.686
[whoosh]

12:56.776 --> 12:57.777
Gotcha.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.126
[camera shutter clicks]

13:00.736 --> 13:03.217
The source is Jing Kuan.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.785
He's a reputable
cultural attaché

13:05.828 --> 13:07.047
for the Taipei government.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.049
Someone in that station
could easily parlay

13:09.092 --> 13:11.007
his connections
into selling secrets.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.617
According to Fiona,
he's been doing that

13:12.661 --> 13:14.141
quite a bit lately.Problem is that

13:14.184 --> 13:16.752
Jing works and lives
on the grounds of the consulate,

13:16.796 --> 13:18.580
so getting to him
is gonna be tricky.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.190
So what's the play?
Stake it out,

13:20.234 --> 13:21.626
wait for him to emerge, and then

13:21.670 --> 13:23.193
confront him
on what he has on Viper?

13:23.237 --> 13:24.629
Not so sure that's an option.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.588
After what happened to you,
Jing got a little jumpy.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.895
He might be holed up in that
consulate for quite some time.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.723
The point is that in order for
us to get close enough to Jing

13:31.767 --> 13:34.117
to question him,
we're gonna have to go in there.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.424
[chuckles] And how on Earth
will you manage that?

13:36.467 --> 13:38.426
They are having
a reception tonight.

13:38.469 --> 13:39.775
There's gonna
be a lot of guests.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.124
We're thinking maybe
that could be our way in.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.039
Yes, but our-our dear Mr. Kuan

13:43.083 --> 13:45.781
is unlikely to surrender
the information he has on Viper

13:45.825 --> 13:47.174
without some resistance,

13:47.217 --> 13:48.871
and, forgive me,

13:48.915 --> 13:50.873
but interrogating a
diplomatic official,

13:50.917 --> 13:52.440
without weapons,

13:52.483 --> 13:54.224
on what is essentially
foreign soil,

13:54.268 --> 13:55.617
with so much security around--

13:55.660 --> 13:57.837
well, it's hardly
what I'd call ideal.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.273
Well, then we're gonna
have to find a way

13:59.316 --> 14:01.101
to get Jing
outside the consulate

14:01.144 --> 14:02.711
in order to question him.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.061
You know what I'm thinking?

14:05.105 --> 14:07.759
Prague, 2014.The embassy.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.414
Yeah. But Houndworth
took weeks to set up.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.416
Well, you know what
you're always saying,

14:12.460 --> 14:13.678
"A good plan today is..."

14:13.722 --> 14:15.855
"Better than a perfect plan
tomorrow." Yeah.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.204
MAGNUM:
Okay, I don't-I don't
know what you guys

14:17.247 --> 14:18.509
are saying, but if you're
saying what I think

14:18.553 --> 14:19.771
you're saying,
you're talking about

14:19.815 --> 14:21.861
going into the Taipei
consulate uninvited,

14:21.904 --> 14:23.950
which is essentially
invading another country,

14:23.993 --> 14:27.040
and kidnapping
a foreign diplomat.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.737
Yes.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.479
That's precisely
what we're saying.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.056
RICK:
There he is-- my client's

14:43.099 --> 14:45.493
would-be son-in-law, Jeremy,

14:45.536 --> 14:48.104
taking his sweet time
deciding what to order.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.193
Boring? Maybe.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.195
But solving a case

14:52.239 --> 14:55.938
is a lot like solving
a jigsaw puzzle--

14:55.982 --> 14:57.853
you got to have patience.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.725
But once that
first piece fits,

15:00.769 --> 15:04.599
then the whole jigsaw puzzle
falls into place.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.035
Okay,

15:06.079 --> 15:08.820
nothing you just
said makes any sense.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.954
And that's not how puzzles
or private investigating works.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.825
You've obviously never seen me
solve a jigsaw puzzle.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.175
I'm very good.

15:15.218 --> 15:17.655
As good as you are
at being a P.I.?Yeah, why?

15:17.699 --> 15:18.787
'Cause your boy over there
just started

15:18.830 --> 15:20.354
flirting with that waitress...What?!

15:20.397 --> 15:21.616
and you totally missed it.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.834
RICK:
First of all,

15:22.878 --> 15:24.314
I was right on top of that.

15:24.358 --> 15:25.968
Second of all,
he's not flirting.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.927
He's probably just
ordering some food

15:27.970 --> 15:29.841
in a...

15:29.885 --> 15:32.670
very jokey way that has her

15:32.714 --> 15:36.500
laughing a lot and touching
his shoulder affectionately.Mm.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.503
Look, if there's anything going
on between the two of them,

15:39.547 --> 15:40.896
you need to hear
what's going on.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.508
You're right.
You're right.

15:44.552 --> 15:45.901
I got an idea.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.642
[beep]

15:47.685 --> 15:51.298
[phone rings]

15:51.341 --> 15:52.690
You're calling me.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.605
Yeah, yeah, pick it up
so it's an active line.

15:54.649 --> 15:57.434
Now, you see that potted plant
right next to Jeremy's table?

15:57.478 --> 15:59.915
I want you to go over there,

15:59.959 --> 16:02.265
drop the phone into it so
we can hear what they're saying.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.485
Unless, of course...

16:04.528 --> 16:06.617
you're not smooth enough
to pull that off.

16:06.661 --> 16:07.967
Am I smooth enough?

16:08.010 --> 16:09.272
[scoffs]
Please.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.621
All right.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.709
Watch me work.

16:11.753 --> 16:14.321
Let's see what
you got, daddy.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.366
[indistinct conversations]

16:32.730 --> 16:34.689
Hey, man, you just
dropped your cell phone.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.214
What phone?

16:38.258 --> 16:41.435
Uh, right there,
in the planter. See?

16:41.478 --> 16:43.654
[chuckles]
Oh.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.004
That's crazy, man.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.962
How'd that happen?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.616
[laughs]Good looking out, man.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.842
[sighs]

17:01.281 --> 17:02.499
Not a word.

17:02.543 --> 17:04.153
[phone rings]

17:04.197 --> 17:06.634
Magnum and Rick, P.I. Services.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.766
Rick speaking,
how may I help you?

17:08.810 --> 17:10.246
How's it going?Good, other than

17:10.290 --> 17:12.335
TC messing up
my surveillance.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.815
It was your plan.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.556
Thomas, it's not his fault.

17:15.599 --> 17:17.427
He doesn't have "pidna"
like me and you.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.603
Pidna?P.I. DNA.

17:19.647 --> 17:20.822
[scoffs]
Whatever, man.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.563
I'll let you guys
duke it out later.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.521
Right now, I need a favor.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.219
All right, hit me.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.090
Who do you know
at the state department?

17:37.621 --> 17:41.625
There are over 300 guests
with plus-ones.

17:41.669 --> 17:45.064
We need to figure out who
I could realistically pass as.

17:45.107 --> 17:48.110
That's easy enough, just
a simple process of elimination.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.460
First, cross off
all the females.

17:50.504 --> 17:53.768
Okay, that leaves us
with 157 guests.

17:53.811 --> 17:57.119
Now we'll zero in those...
35 to 40.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.600
35? I could definitely

17:59.643 --> 18:01.645
pass for somebody
in their late 20s.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.779
Don't flatter yourself.
35 to 40.

18:04.822 --> 18:07.564
All right, that leaves us
with 13 guests.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.914
Cross out the
obvious ethnicities.Mm-hmm.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.874
That leaves us with three.
Two of whom are public figures,

18:12.917 --> 18:14.702
who you couldn't
realistically pretend to be,

18:14.745 --> 18:15.920
which leaves us one.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.923
David Gomez,
scholar and a

18:18.967 --> 18:20.708
successful author.
That's nice.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.711
Someone smart, with a job?

18:23.754 --> 18:25.452
Reckon you can pull that off?

18:25.495 --> 18:28.411
Very funny. Yes,
I can be David Gomez.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.283
Right. Then I will be
his plus-one.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.806
Now all we need
is his invitation

18:31.849 --> 18:33.547
and a way to ensure
that the real David Gomez

18:33.590 --> 18:35.288
doesn't turn up at the party.

18:38.334 --> 18:39.901
I have an idea.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.946
[phone rings]

18:43.905 --> 18:45.863
Rick and Magnum,
P.I. Services.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.300
Rick speaking.
How can I help you?

18:47.343 --> 18:49.954
Rick and Magnum? What happened
to Magnum and Rick.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.739
Eh, management's restructuring.
What's up?

18:51.782 --> 18:52.957
I need a favor.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.481
[chuckles]
Again?

18:54.524 --> 18:55.873
Yeah, but not
from you, from TC.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.788
No, no, I'm sorry,
he's helping me out right now.

18:57.832 --> 18:59.660
I thought you said
he was getting in the way

18:59.703 --> 19:00.878
of your surveillance.

19:00.922 --> 19:03.577
I said no such thing.Yes, you did.

19:03.620 --> 19:04.752
Besides, I need his help.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.449
Yeah, I need his help
right now, too.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.495
Look, guys, guys, fellas,

19:08.538 --> 19:10.584
as much as it feels good
to be fought over,

19:10.627 --> 19:12.020
I'm not a piece of meat.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.675
[mutters][chuckles]

19:14.718 --> 19:17.808
Let me guess, Magnum--
you need a ride somewhere.

19:17.852 --> 19:20.681
Yes, but not in the chopper.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.602
Excuse me, is this
Diamond Head Road?

19:28.645 --> 19:30.386
The consulate's the other way.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.432
Sorry, Mr. Gomez,

19:32.475 --> 19:35.217
my navigation said
there's been an accident.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.524
This is the long way,
but we'll get there faster.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.265
You guys got your tickets?

19:39.308 --> 19:40.788
Yup, I got them right here.

19:40.831 --> 19:43.399
Perfect.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.057
Now what's going on?

19:49.100 --> 19:51.233
I'm real sorry.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.148
I feel awful about this.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.193
Awful about what?

19:56.282 --> 19:57.892
Almost forgot--
I got you guys

19:57.935 --> 19:59.850
some quarter waters,
some chips, some dip.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.635
I'll be back
in a few hours, okay?

20:01.678 --> 20:03.158

Is there a problem?

Look, just call
Detective Katsumoto,

32:29.295 --> 32:30.687
and he'll tell you who we are.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.037

KUMU:
TC, he's gone!

32:35.083 --> 32:36.519
Gone?

32:36.563 --> 32:37.868
What do you mean he's gone?

32:37.912 --> 32:40.001
I don't know.
He's not here.

32:40.045 --> 32:43.178
All right.
Call me if you hear from him.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.026
Please, can you just
call Katsumoto?

33:05.070 --> 33:07.115
Officers, I can assure you
there is a perfectly reasonable

33:07.159 --> 33:08.725
explanation for all of this.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.118
Look, no one's interested
in hearing anything

33:10.162 --> 33:11.598
you guys have to say.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.692
Central, 4-Adam-Henry.
We've been in an accident.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.086
Requesting backup and EMS.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.053
TC, what the hell
are you doing?

33:32.097 --> 33:35.013
You guys ain't
gonna believe this.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.841
Calling all units, suspects have
fled in our black and white.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.677
Are you sure it was Ian?Positive.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.506
Then, after he snuck inside,
I called Kumu back.

33:50.550 --> 33:53.727
She checked. She said the last
number called on the landline

33:53.770 --> 33:55.642
was to the security office
at the consulate.

33:55.685 --> 33:56.991
Your boy Ian made that call

33:57.035 --> 33:58.166
right before
the alarms went off.

33:58.210 --> 33:59.602
He gave us up.

33:59.646 --> 34:02.214
He used us as a distraction
so he can sneak in.

34:02.257 --> 34:04.390
TC:
Yeah. Any idea
what he's up to?

34:04.433 --> 34:05.826
He's got to be after Jing.

34:05.869 --> 34:07.045
Yeah, but why?

34:07.088 --> 34:08.437
You two already
had that covered.

34:08.481 --> 34:10.526
And how the hell
is he gonna get him out?

34:10.570 --> 34:12.920
I don't think
he's thinking about that.

34:12.963 --> 34:15.096
I think he's going
to silence him.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.098
What are you talking about?

34:17.142 --> 34:19.231
You think he's Viper.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.928
It's the only explanation.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.193
TC, turn the car around.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.239
You sure that's a good idea?Yeah.

34:27.282 --> 34:28.544
Take us back to the consulate.

34:40.469 --> 34:42.123
TC:
If Ian's going after

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
this Jing, why aren't we
calling the HPD?

34:44.169 --> 34:45.779
Think about it.
He's an assassin.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.128

when he gets cornered?

Yeah.

You all right?

I'm fine.
Let's just get there.
