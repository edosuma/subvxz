04:50.190 --> 04:51.857
This is the first one.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.061
It's the easiest one, you won't
need much time to get it.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.670
This one will be a little
longer.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.613
You have to be patient with this
one.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.716
It's just a matter of time.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.118
Any questions about the
cylinders?

05:20.354 --> 05:22.120
I'd like to see it now.

05:22.923 --> 05:23.923
Of course.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.174
Ready?

05:46.146 --> 05:47.146
Yes.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.752
What do you think?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.221
It's cool, right?

05:59.460 --> 06:02.160
Yes but don't want him...

06:02.696 --> 06:03.962
to see it.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.820
Don't worry.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.264
We're nearly there, ok?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.142
There.

06:53.981 --> 06:56.448
Finished. How does it feel?

06:58.786 --> 07:00.419
It's ok.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.855
Does it feel rough or does it
hurt at all?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.695
Shall we give it a try?

07:12.566 --> 07:13.665
Yes.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.720
First the blue one.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.529
You have to think that you can
move it.

07:54.875 --> 07:55.907
Good.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.779
Now close it.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.364
Can't do it.
How do I take it off?

08:19.533 --> 08:20.565
Ok.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.134
You wanna give it another go?
No.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.937
Right.

08:25.938 --> 08:28.138
I have to explain it to your
dad, ok? I have to do it.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.943
You can't have a shower with it,

08:31.945 --> 08:34.946
and it's not really comfortable
to sleep, ok?

08:38.051 --> 08:40.952
How long will it take me to use
it properly?

08:41.655 --> 08:46.291
That depends on you. If you're
patient, it will be quick.

08:48.529 --> 08:50.829
I'm gonna go talk to your dad,
ok?

09:02.509 --> 09:07.479
A little concerned of her
psychological impact... All right.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.137
So how did it go?

09:32.673 --> 09:34.539
Can I let mum out yet?

09:41.315 --> 09:42.315
Yeah.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.387
What are you hiding there?

10:24.057 --> 10:25.790
Nothing.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.760
You're hiding something, I can
smell it.

10:28.962 --> 10:33.632
Yes but you must promise me that
you're not going to be scared.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.233
I promise.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.041
Well, what do you think of it?

10:43.577 --> 10:45.910
It doesn't smell like you.

10:56.923 --> 11:00.959
- Better?
- Yes, it's better now.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.984
Let's start with the blue one,
shall we?

11:26.953 --> 11:28.086
Ok.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.233
How do you do that?

11:42.469 --> 11:44.536
Do you just have to think about
it?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.971
Yeah, kind of.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.274
It's difficult to explain.

11:52.612 --> 11:53.978
Try to drop it.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.482
Very good.

12:19.306 --> 12:22.474
Ok, ok, ok. Don't worry.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.510
Try again.

12:26.747 --> 12:27.979
No.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.714
Come on Alice.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.283
Don't give up so easy?

12:33.186 --> 12:35.220
I'm not gonna do it again.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.823
Just one more time. Come on.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.258
No.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.496
Alice, just do it.

12:45.499 --> 12:47.832
I said no!

12:48.401 --> 12:51.903
I'm going to take a walk with mum,
I'll be back later. Wait, wait.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.407
Alice sit down.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.211
She's not your mum.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.654
You know that I hate you,
don't you?

13:12.592 --> 13:13.792
Yes.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.461
Good.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.396
What is it?

13:55.836 --> 13:57.402
Don't know.

17:03.723 --> 17:05.423
Where is dad?

17:40.794 --> 17:42.693
Alice!

17:43.396 --> 17:45.163
Alice!

17:46.132 --> 17:47.799
Alice!

17:50.170 --> 17:52.136
Alice!

19:22.395 --> 19:23.895
What's your name?

19:28.101 --> 19:30.401
His name is Paul.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.938
I am Erika.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.141
He doesn't talk.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.244
Is he mute?

19:40.613 --> 19:43.047
Yes. Kind of.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.951
I'm Alice.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.620
He is my father, Adam.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.990
And she is my mother, Beatrice.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.229
Erika,

20:00.266 --> 20:01.799
who did this?

20:04.137 --> 20:07.939
If you don't tell us, we'll have
to call the police.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.775
David.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.278
He is my boyfriend.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.417
This morning he called me to go
make a picnic.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.021
I asked him if Paul could come
with us.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.824
"No".

20:28.027 --> 20:30.127
But Paul followed me,

20:30.830 --> 20:32.430
and he saw us.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.374
I asked him to stop,

20:43.943 --> 20:46.577
that Paul was there, but he
wouldn't.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.648
So I hit him.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.218
And he got very angry.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.289
I had never seen him like that
before.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.860
Where does David live?

21:06.232 --> 21:10.067
I don't know. He never took me
to his house.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.773
And where do you live?

21:17.343 --> 21:18.743
In town.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.778
With your parents?

21:23.283 --> 21:25.182
They're dead.

21:34.594 --> 21:36.427
I'm gonna prepare you a room.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.330
And tomorrow I'll take you home.

21:40.066 --> 21:47.405
And don't worry... the
house is shielded, the doors

21:47.407 --> 21:50.808
are double locked and they can't
be opened from the outside.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.814
Is that ok to you?

22:28.815 --> 22:31.048
Do you feel better now?

22:37.090 --> 22:39.557
Everything's going to be
alright.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.760
Don't think about David.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.075
What do you think about her?

23:01.714 --> 23:05.316
Do you like her?

23:50.563 --> 23:52.797
I just came to see if you were
alright.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.132
We are ok. Thanks.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.501
I'm glad to hear it.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.738
May I ask you a question?

24:01.974 --> 24:03.507
Yes, of course.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.477
What happened to Alice's arm?

24:07.213 --> 24:09.313
The dress you're wearing is
mine.

24:10.183 --> 24:13.050
But it doesn't matter. You can
keep it.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.165
I'm worried Alice. They don't
smell good to me.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.367
Neither they do to me mum.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.078
There's something out there.

25:48.481 --> 25:50.414
I'm sure you can see it.

25:53.052 --> 25:56.020
Alice, you really have to go
tell Adam.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.388
Why?

25:58.024 --> 26:00.624
Because he will protect us.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.672
Where did you see it?

26:18.544 --> 26:20.477
Behind these bushes.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.717
There's nothing there.

26:34.860 --> 26:38.729
There was something black behind
of those bushes in front of you.

26:41.601 --> 26:45.269
Wait, it's not there anymore.
It's... it's moved.

26:48.741 --> 26:53.811
What's that over there? That black
thing behind that bush over there.

26:58.217 --> 26:59.750
What happened?

27:01.554 --> 27:06.256
It's nothing. Don't worry, you
can go to bed.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.792
Are you sure?

27:50.870 --> 27:51.870
Dad.

27:53.472 --> 27:54.472
What?

27:59.578 --> 28:01.345
I know that you like her.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.683
Well...

28:05.685 --> 28:06.984
They're leaving today.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.089
Maybe they should stay one more
day.

28:13.559 --> 28:14.892
Just in case.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.481
Where is your sister?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.286
Where is your sister?

33:17.329 --> 33:20.297
Alice! Alice come back!

33:21.266 --> 33:22.632
Alice!

33:24.703 --> 33:25.902
Alice.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.041
How do you do it in front of
her?

33:31.910 --> 33:33.176
Do what?

33:33.645 --> 33:37.147
Touch her face! In front of mum!

33:37.649 --> 33:39.416
Touch that bitch!

33:42.321 --> 33:44.287
She's not your mum.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.992
You son of a bitch, yes she is!

33:50.229 --> 33:51.995
No baby, she's not your mum.

33:51.997 --> 33:56.566
Yes she is! You transformed her!
She's like that because of you!

33:56.769 --> 33:59.036
You transformed me too!

33:59.505 --> 34:02.139
Look at what you've done!

34:03.542 --> 34:04.574
Look!

34:06.311 --> 34:07.611
I'm sorry.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.947
Alice, Alice I'm sorry.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.552
We're not the same anymore.

34:16.422 --> 34:17.487
That's not...

34:17.489 --> 34:19.489
We're not the same anymore.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.760
Yes, we're different!

34:24.730 --> 34:27.531
No baby, no. You're not.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.567
You transformed us all!

34:31.335 --> 34:33.170
Don't deny it!

34:37.409 --> 34:38.909
I killed her.

34:39.678 --> 34:40.744
No.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.280
No, no, no, no!

34:43.282 --> 34:46.216
I killed her. No she's there!
She's right there!

34:46.217 --> 34:49.058
No, I killed her, I killed her, I
killed her, I killed her... No, look!

34:49.288 --> 34:53.824
No! No! No! Baby, baby, listen.

34:53.826 --> 34:58.795
Listen to me, listen to me,
honey, honey, honey... No!

35:00.933 --> 35:02.365
Forgive me.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.268
I can't, I'm sorry.

35:07.039 --> 35:11.108
Forgive me, please.
I swear I tried but I can't.

35:14.813 --> 35:18.181
Tell her you're sorry. Tell mum
that you're sorry.

35:18.851 --> 35:20.750
Go tell her now.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.321
I can't do that.

35:26.425 --> 35:29.226
Tell her you're sorry!
I can't do that.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.897
I can't do that baby.

35:35.534 --> 35:41.071
You didn't love her you fucking
murderer!

35:41.440 --> 35:45.675
You didn't love her, you're a
fucking murderer! Don't say that.

35:46.411 --> 35:47.677
Don't say that.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.415
Tell mum that you're sorry!

35:52.684 --> 35:53.684
No.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.418
Tell her!

35:55.420 --> 36:01.992
No, I won't! I won't tell her I'm sorry!
I won't tell her anything!

38:59.771 --> 39:01.171
Are you sure?

39:02.107 --> 39:03.373
Yes.

39:03.975 --> 39:07.811
But Alice, maybe the girl in the
listening is not you.

39:08.213 --> 39:10.714
It's me.

39:10.715 --> 39:13.216
And how is it that she is able
to use the cube and you're not?

39:15.587 --> 39:17.687
'Cause it hasn't happened yet.

39:17.989 --> 39:21.358
I don't think I would trust her.
It could be a trap.

39:22.627 --> 39:26.563
She will explain everything to
me. She will explain who they

39:26.565 --> 39:31.968
are and how the cube works. She
will help me fix everything.

39:33.572 --> 39:34.572
Mum?

39:35.173 --> 39:36.940
Yes sweetheart, tell me.

39:37.409 --> 39:38.942
Do you love me?

39:39.511 --> 39:43.346
I love you so much. More than
anything in this world.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.348
So do I.

40:06.338 --> 40:07.337
Hello.

40:07.339 --> 40:08.571
Hi.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.277
I know this is very weird.

40:14.279 --> 40:16.897
You said it.

40:16.898 --> 40:19.516
You have to prepare. If you're
sitting down, get up.

40:20.819 --> 40:23.186
First and foremost, don't get
nervous.

40:23.455 --> 40:25.688
No one must know I'm talking to
you.

40:26.191 --> 40:30.326
Erika and Paul might hear us. They might
even be listening to us right now.

40:30.529 --> 40:33.229
You have to be careful. You
mustn't trust them.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.031
I need you to do something.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.034
What? It's something important.

40:38.503 --> 40:41.671
We'll do it step by step.
It'll be easier. No.

40:41.673 --> 40:46.676
First, tell me what the cube is. First of all,
you have to go see dad. He's in the piano room.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.945
No!

40:48.946 --> 40:51.213
Tell him that you've seen David.
Make sure he goes outside the house.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.516
And above all, don't let him
call the police,

40:53.518 --> 40:55.718
It always goes wrong when he
does it.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.853
What?

40:58.089 --> 41:00.290
Go now and leave mum in the
room.

41:00.725 --> 41:03.259
She must not go with you, it'll
be easier.

41:03.261 --> 41:07.630
Hurry up, we don't have much time.
If they notice it'll be too late.

41:30.088 --> 41:36.259
Are you with dad yet? I hope I'm not going
too fast. It's difficult to calculate.

41:48.273 --> 41:49.273
Dad?

41:53.645 --> 41:55.378
I'm sorry baby.

41:58.049 --> 42:00.049
I think I've seen someone
outside.

42:03.255 --> 42:04.521
Where are they?

42:05.023 --> 42:07.357
They're ok. They're in their
room.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.963
Ok, I'm gonna call the police.

42:13.965 --> 42:17.233
Wait, wait, wait please don't,
don't, don't call them.

42:17.235 --> 42:18.501
Why not?

42:25.010 --> 42:29.946
Well... Erika told me that she
wouldn't report him because...

42:30.282 --> 42:35.051
she doesn't want that... for Paul... I'm
sure that a scare will be enough...

42:39.391 --> 42:41.658
Ok. Listen.

42:41.893 --> 42:45.261
Just go to them. Don't tell them
anything.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.664
- Ok?
- Ok.

42:47.666 --> 42:49.666
I'll go have a look around.

42:52.504 --> 42:53.504
Dad?

42:53.939 --> 42:54.938
Yeah?

42:54.940 --> 42:59.008
Now go to
the kitchen and look for Paul.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.545
Be careful.

43:05.417 --> 43:06.449
Yeah.

43:20.065 --> 43:24.233
When you find him be aware. He mustn't
know that you're listening to me.

43:43.054 --> 43:44.220
Paul?

44:03.074 --> 44:04.074
Hi.

44:09.948 --> 44:11.581
Are you hungry?

44:29.734 --> 44:31.734
I can make a sandwich for the
two of us.

44:31.736 --> 44:33.536
Alice...

44:33.538 --> 44:37.173
I suppose you're already with him.
Erika will be here at any time.

44:37.509 --> 44:39.475
We have to do it now.

44:39.911 --> 44:41.177
Sit down.

44:54.092 --> 44:55.992
You have to grab a knife...

44:57.195 --> 44:58.528
and kill him.

45:01.366 --> 45:03.766
I know you're scared.
I'm scared too.

45:04.269 --> 45:06.102
And I know it's difficult.

45:06.671 --> 45:09.772
But you have to trust me.
Kill him.

45:12.477 --> 45:15.945
And when Erika arrives, kill
this bitch too.

45:24.155 --> 45:27.757
Do it quickly. We've done this
before.

45:28.560 --> 45:33.062
I can't remember how many times. And
it always ends up the same way.

45:33.765 --> 45:36.666
The only thing we haven't tried
is killing them.

45:49.647 --> 45:50.780
No!

45:53.251 --> 45:54.550
I can do it.

45:56.888 --> 46:01.524
Alice, I'm very tired. I don't know
if I will be able to carry on.

46:01.960 --> 46:05.228
If you don't do it something
terrible will happen.

46:05.663 --> 46:09.265
And it's better for you not to
know it. Do it now.

46:36.828 --> 46:40.163
I know that you like him but
don't trust him. Please!

46:40.899 --> 46:42.498
Kill him please.

46:46.271 --> 46:47.503
Kill him.

46:48.273 --> 46:49.505
Please.

46:51.509 --> 46:52.875
Kill him!

47:03.087 --> 47:05.855
I have to go. Good luck.

47:22.774 --> 47:24.874
What are you listening to?

47:26.878 --> 47:27.878
Nothing.

47:31.749 --> 47:33.316
Let me listen to it.

47:34.485 --> 47:37.620
I'm making a sandwich. Do you
want one?

47:40.959 --> 47:42.491
No, thank you.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.898
Have you seen your father?

47:49.667 --> 47:50.933
He's gone.

47:51.870 --> 47:52.870
Where?

47:54.772 --> 47:56.205
I don't know.

49:27.999 --> 49:32.301
You know what you have to do.

50:42.440 --> 50:43.440
Dog?

50:45.309 --> 50:47.276
Well... wait here.

55:50.915 --> 55:52.314
Mum?

55:55.720 --> 55:57.252
Mum?

56:29.587 --> 56:30.753
Mum?

56:39.163 --> 56:40.329
Mum?

57:21.372 --> 57:22.671
Mum.

57:28.446 --> 57:29.812
Mum?

57:35.853 --> 57:37.252
Mum?

57:45.429 --> 57:46.862
Mum?

58:00.744 --> 58:02.377
Mum?

58:04.949 --> 58:06.215
Mum.

58:29.507 --> 58:31.073
Mum.

01:00:05.502 --> 01:00:06.668
Open!

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.818
Open!

01:00:34.665 --> 01:00:36.431
Open!

01:00:51.482 --> 01:00:52.948
Open!

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:20.609
I hate you.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.417
I hate you!

01:03:13.223 --> 01:03:14.723
Are you ready?

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.292
Where did you see it?

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:43.098
Behind those bushes.

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:53.275
Where?

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.445
There's nothing there.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:09.224
There was something black behind
those bushes in front of you.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:50.098
Alice, please help me.

01:08:40.584 --> 01:08:42.917
Is it you? Or is it Paul?

01:08:58.167 --> 01:09:00.268
Turn round sweetheart.

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:07.975
How long do I have to wait mum?

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:18.520
Just a few minutes.
Come inside the room.

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:05.733
Dad.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.172
I'm really sorry baby.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:14.275
I think I've seen someone
outside.

01:10:17.414 --> 01:10:18.279
Where are they?

01:10:18.281 --> 01:10:20.448
They're ok. They're in their
room.

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:28.756
I'm gonna call the police.

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:32.827
Wait. Why? No. Don't call them.

01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:34.063
Why not?

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:37.899
Well...

01:10:37.901 --> 01:10:41.769
Erika told me that she would
never report him because...

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:43.771
she doesn't want that for Paul.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:46.341
I'm sure that a scare
will be enough.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.280
Ok. Listen.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:55.250
Just go with them.
And wait with them.

01:10:55.785 --> 01:10:57.552
But don't tell them anything.

01:10:57.854 --> 01:10:58.920
Ok?

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:00.922
Ok. I'm going out
look around there.

01:11:02.492 --> 01:11:03.492
Dad?

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:05.261
Yeah.

01:11:09.032 --> 01:11:10.398
Be careful.

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:13.369
Yeah.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:14.803
Ok.

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:46.501
Paul?

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:02.217
Hi.

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:07.422
Are you hungry?

01:12:15.598 --> 01:12:18.032
I can make a sandwich for the
two of us.

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.007
Sit down.

01:13:07.784 --> 01:13:09.183
Can you help me?

01:19:29.265 --> 01:19:30.731
Alice!

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.033
Alice!

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:37.872
Alice!

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:14.008
What the fuck have you done?!

01:20:15.812 --> 01:20:19.113
Fuck you've done?! No!

01:20:19.282 --> 01:20:22.550
Fucking no! Fuck you've done?!

01:20:22.985 --> 01:20:25.586
Fuck you've done?!

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:32.426
Fuck you've done?!

01:20:33.396 --> 01:20:37.097
What have you fucking done?!

01:21:31.821 --> 01:21:32.821
Dad.

01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:37.725
Dad!

01:21:42.298 --> 01:21:43.464
Dad!

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:52.039
Dad!

01:23:02.912 --> 01:23:04.144
Okay...

01:23:09.285 --> 01:23:11.785
I'm gonna really try...

01:23:13.889 --> 01:23:15.456
and believe...

01:23:16.726 --> 01:23:19.026
everything you say.

01:23:22.631 --> 01:23:26.033
Every last word.

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:37.611
I found something in the woods.

01:23:43.786 --> 01:23:44.786
Ok.

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:49.423
What?

01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:57.464
I don't know what it is.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:13.981
What do you think it is?

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:26.560
I think it's a...

01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:33.567
some sort of a...

01:24:38.707 --> 01:24:40.908
time machine.

01:24:55.024 --> 01:24:56.024
Ok.

01:25:13.642 --> 01:25:14.642
Ok.

01:25:16.212 --> 01:25:17.845
Ok, I do too.

01:25:34.897 --> 01:25:37.131
What does it have to do with
them?

01:25:41.504 --> 01:25:42.636
I don't know.

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:48.575
I think it's a coincidence.

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:00.888
How does it work? I mean...

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:05.692
you didn't explain it in the...

01:26:07.196 --> 01:26:10.397
in the video... in the
recording.

01:26:12.468 --> 01:26:14.234
I don't know exactly.

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:26.813
I believe it works
just like my arm.

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:29.149
Mentally.

01:26:30.619 --> 01:26:32.019
Do you get it?

01:26:32.888 --> 01:26:34.788
You have to think.

01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:50.704
Show me.

01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:48.835
Are Erika and Paul alright?

01:31:52.608 --> 01:31:54.908
Yeah. They're fine.

01:31:57.379 --> 01:31:59.045
I thank you.

01:32:41.356 --> 01:32:43.223
My name is David.

01:32:44.092 --> 01:32:45.859
And you killed my parents.

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:50.730
You killed my mother.

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:54.034
You killed my father.

01:32:57.172 --> 01:33:00.040
My father's name was David,
like mine.

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:05.011
My mother's name was Margaret.

01:33:05.747 --> 01:33:07.614
Like her mother's.

01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:15.589
My father liked the color blue.

01:33:20.295 --> 01:33:22.228
And pizza.

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:30.804
And his favourite actor
was Tom Hanks.

01:33:34.643 --> 01:33:35.909
My mother...

01:33:37.012 --> 01:33:38.812
She loved travelling.

01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:44.084
She loves Paris.

01:33:46.588 --> 01:33:47.887
And dogs.

01:33:56.865 --> 01:33:59.799
She was the one that taught me
how to love.

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:06.306
They were just people.

01:34:08.377 --> 01:34:12.345
Working all their life so we
could have a future.

01:34:13.582 --> 01:34:16.516
They were important only for us.

01:34:16.752 --> 01:34:18.618
And for our friends.

01:34:25.694 --> 01:34:29.729
But I want to see them, I won't
be able to see them again.

01:34:32.234 --> 01:34:33.667
Touch them...

01:34:37.506 --> 01:34:41.441
If I have questions for them,
they're not there to answer...

01:34:43.812 --> 01:34:45.345
If I want a hug...

01:34:47.883 --> 01:34:48.982
What...

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:58.558
If I wanna see them again I have
to look at pictures on my phone...

01:35:24.486 --> 01:35:26.119
They took...

01:35:26.722 --> 01:35:28.455
They took the car...

01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:32.225
They took the car the same day
that you did.

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:36.863
Same day!

01:36:51.706 --> 01:36:53.840
My father's name is Adam.

01:36:56.211 --> 01:36:58.511
My mother's name is Beatrice.

01:37:00.916 --> 01:37:03.283
My father likes AC/DC.

01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:07.420
Even though he's never attended
a concert.

01:37:09.124 --> 01:37:10.124
Cooking...

01:37:11.059 --> 01:37:13.359
Even if he can't do it properly.

01:37:14.529 --> 01:37:16.162
Dogs and animals...

01:37:16.698 --> 01:37:18.932
And Star Trek movies.

01:37:20.902 --> 01:37:23.603
My mother loves classical music.

01:37:26.374 --> 01:37:29.142
The smell of the garden after
the rain...

01:37:30.612 --> 01:37:33.580
Pouring ketchup on everything...

01:37:35.050 --> 01:37:36.583
Reading books...

01:37:38.053 --> 01:37:39.853
Even bad ones...

01:37:41.423 --> 01:37:44.490
And she also loves Tom Hanks.

01:38:15.624 --> 01:38:17.857
We have to go back to this day.

01:38:18.526 --> 01:38:20.894
Prevent all this from happening.

01:38:23.331 --> 01:38:24.564
No.

01:38:26.635 --> 01:38:29.302
What are we going to do with
Erika and Paul?

01:38:30.071 --> 01:38:31.671
They're still in their bedroom.

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.907
We can't leave them there
forever.

01:38:57.132 --> 01:38:58.765
Concentrate.

01:39:09.678 --> 01:39:11.844
You'll need more than a day.

01:39:20.221 --> 01:39:22.622
You'll need more than a week.

01:39:25.327 --> 01:39:28.127
You already know how much time
you need.

01:39:29.698 --> 01:39:32.732
I need seven months
and twelve days.

01:39:33.902 --> 01:39:35.468
Close your eyes.

01:39:36.972 --> 01:39:38.805
When you get there...

01:39:39.741 --> 01:39:43.443
grab the car keys. They're in my
desk drawer.

01:39:44.079 --> 01:39:45.645
You know which one?

01:39:46.314 --> 01:39:48.081
In the piano room.

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:50.650
When you get there...

01:39:50.919 --> 01:39:52.652
what will you do?

01:39:54.122 --> 01:39:57.690
Throw them. Throw them away.

01:39:58.305 --> 01:40:04.642
