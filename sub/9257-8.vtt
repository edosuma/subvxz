WEBVTT

00:06.269 --> 00:09.781
Ronnie. Ronnie. Ronnie?

00:09.980 --> 00:12.183
Armadillo?

00:12.347 --> 00:14.321
–Armadillo, right?
–Uh-huh.

00:14.459 --> 00:16.978
No, no, no. Don't move, Ronnie.
They're comin'.

00:17.018 --> 00:19.384
All right,
here you go.

00:21.048 --> 00:23.382
You're gonna be okay,
Ronnie.

00:23.544 --> 00:24.973
Right.

00:31.414 --> 00:32.842
Don't move, buddy.

00:38.740 --> 00:40.587
–Take care of him, will ya?
–Yeah. Yeah.

00:40.627 --> 00:43.663
–We're gonna fix this, brother.
–Hang in, man.

00:50.577 --> 00:52.300
I'm sorry
about your guy.

00:52.496 --> 00:55.594
This was Armadillo,
wasn't it?

01:00.622 --> 01:02.858
Are you staying
at the hotel?

01:03.021 --> 01:05.860
No. Vic and I were discussing
a domestic abuse case.

01:05.900 --> 01:09.507
She's only been here a few minutes.
There's nothing she can tell you that I can't.

01:09.547 --> 01:12.583
–Give me a call if you need anything.
–I will.

01:15.626 --> 01:17.349
Jesus.

01:17.385 --> 01:20.035
What is it with this guy
and burning?

01:20.264 --> 01:25.348
First, traces of flesh
on the stove burners at his house.

01:25.671 --> 01:27.492
Now this.

01:27.686 --> 01:29.666
Armadillo
was looking for you.

01:29.670 --> 01:31.262
I know.

01:31.461 --> 01:33.184
Trust me.
One of ours?

01:33.380 --> 01:35.867
I'm gonna help you
take care of it.

01:37.764 --> 01:41.375
Claudette, don't take this
the wrong way…

01:41.666 --> 01:43.738
but I don't need your help.

01:47.457 --> 01:50.456
We gotta find Armadillo before somebody
matches his face up to Ronnie's.

01:50.496 --> 01:52.252
How you wanna
handle this?

01:52.447 --> 01:56.694
The way we should've weeks ago…
flush out every shithole in the
barrio until we find this prick.

01:56.734 --> 01:58.901
–Sounds like a plan.
–Then we end it.

01:58.941 --> 02:01.559
Once and for all.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.881
–Vic.
–Hey, no speeches.

02:06.075 --> 02:08.339
Armadillo burned my guy.
I'm gettin' him.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.258
I just talked
to the hospital.

02:10.299 --> 02:14.523
Looks like they're gonna
be able to graft most of Ronnie's face.

02:15.001 --> 02:16.789
Thanks.

02:18.808 --> 02:21.711
I'm gonna contact Justice, bring in
a surveillance team to watch your back.

02:21.751 --> 02:24.206
–You wanna baby-sit us?
–No, I just wanna keep you alive.

02:24.246 --> 02:26.094
We can take care
of ourselves.

02:26.134 --> 02:28.942
The last thing either one of us needs
is the feds thinking that we can't.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.883
Just let us do
what we do… sir.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.803
Hey, you didn't see Ronnie.

02:35.284 --> 02:37.072
I can imagine.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.274
Okay.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:50.383 --> 02:53.191
All right, pull 15, 20 grand
from the retirement fund.

02:53.231 --> 02:55.942
We're gonna need to grease some greasers
to get to Armadillo.

02:55.982 --> 02:59.047
Does this mean you're giving us back
our keys?

02:59.181 --> 03:01.450
We won't let you down.

03:23.398 --> 03:26.782
I went to see Ronnie.
He made a preliminary statement.

03:26.822 --> 03:30.716
–It's enough to put an all-points
out for Armadillo.
–Good.

03:30.980 --> 03:34.139
–Where's Mackey?
–He's trying to flush out Armadillo.

03:34.179 --> 03:36.600
You turned him loose
on this guy?

03:36.771 --> 03:39.066
One of his guys was maimed last night.
He wants to be involved.

03:39.106 --> 03:41.434
I know he's involved.
How involved are you?

03:41.474 --> 03:43.197
–Excuse me?
–With Mackey.

03:43.393 --> 03:45.976
I see what's in it for him.
What's in it for you?

03:46.016 --> 03:48.856
Stop looking for conspiracies
that don't exist.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.513
Just investigate
Ronnie's attack.

03:56.573 --> 03:59.222
You're taking T& A
to a whole new level, Van Bro.

03:59.262 --> 04:02.324
Inner-city realism wasn't sellin'.
People like to be titillated.

04:02.364 --> 04:05.203
–Ain't that the truth.
–What you need, Mackey?

04:05.243 --> 04:08.946
–One of my guys got hurt last night.
–Damn. Dangerous times, man.

04:08.986 --> 04:11.189
–Who did it?
–Armadillo.

04:11.353 --> 04:13.424
I been hearin' some impressive things
about that Mexican.

04:13.464 --> 04:15.155
Impressive how?

04:15.352 --> 04:17.200
Word is he don't trust
L.A talent.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.527
He's shipping his own folks
from Mexico City to run the consolidation.

04:20.567 --> 04:22.290
Some smart-ass C.E.O.

04:22.486 --> 04:25.805
Here. I want you to spread this around
and spread the word.

04:25.845 --> 04:28.301
I'm willing to pay for info
on Armadillo.

04:28.341 --> 04:30.250
All I need's a location.

04:31.347 --> 04:33.070
I'll do my thing, baby.

04:33.267 --> 04:34.990
You do that.

04:35.186 --> 04:36.818
Ready for
the big day?

04:36.852 --> 04:39.945
Oh, yes. I picked up the rings this morning.
I'm glad you're coming.

04:39.985 --> 04:41.773
Wouldn't miss it.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.040
Julien.

04:45.073 --> 04:47.879
I just wanted to tell you
in front of your training officer…

04:47.919 --> 04:51.622
that, based on your six-month review
and your performance lately…

04:51.662 --> 04:54.434
I've put your name in
for a P-2 promotion.

04:54.541 --> 04:56.712
Really?

04:56.844 --> 04:58.437
–Thank you.
–Good work.

04:58.636 --> 05:00.294
Keep it up.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.739
–Congratulations.
–Thank you.

05:04.874 --> 05:06.597
Wow.

05:06.793 --> 05:09.121
I'm just feeling
so blessed right now.

05:09.161 --> 05:12.001
I got a great job,
a wonderful wife, a new son.

05:12.041 --> 05:14.912
I just feel like God is
really looking out for me now.

05:14.952 --> 05:19.506
If you ever meet someone,
you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

05:21.990 --> 05:24.356
–This way. Hurry.
–What is it, sir?

05:26.852 --> 05:29.252
Oh, Christ.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.133
No, no, no. Don't touch him.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.942
One-Tango-13 requesting paramedics,
code three.

05:35.138 --> 05:36.861
Copy, One-Tango-13.

05:37.025 --> 05:39.193
–One-Tango-13, additional units requested.
–Copy that.

05:39.233 --> 05:40.955
Hey,
what do you got?

05:41.152 --> 05:42.875
Little Pop, Los Mags O.G.

05:43.071 --> 05:44.919
Just got out of Pelican Bay
last week…

05:44.959 --> 05:48.215
and he is not happy about Armadillo's
power restructuring neither.

05:48.255 --> 05:50.937
You got the bone.
He's got the pick.

05:55.165 --> 05:56.887
Yo!

05:57.084 --> 05:59.385
Welcome home,
Little Pop.

05:59.547 --> 06:03.639
I hear you're having some problems
with your Torruco brothers.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.194
I had it good inside.

06:06.329 --> 06:09.460
I was movin' drugs, smokes,
a little gambling.

06:09.529 --> 06:12.208
I made enough to keep my mom
straight out here.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.127
Armadillo moves
into Pelican Bay.

06:14.167 --> 06:16.850
I take his ink,
kick him back his cut…

06:17.047 --> 06:19.753
and then he promises me
a piece out here.

06:19.862 --> 06:21.552
So I took my parole…

06:21.749 --> 06:23.440
come on home.

06:23.636 --> 06:25.516
Armadillo had
a change of heart.

06:25.556 --> 06:29.324
That choco. He brings up these real
Mexicans from MC to run things.

06:29.364 --> 06:32.394
Suddenly I'm a goddamn wetback
in my own country.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.986
Errand boy, getting beers
for these pendejos.

06:35.026 --> 06:36.814
No money, no respect.

06:41.744 --> 06:43.980
I ain't got nothin'
out here…

06:44.143 --> 06:46.825
and I'm too old
to start over.

06:48.589 --> 06:50.890
I gotta get me
back inside.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.708
It's gonna take me months to get back
the respect and the juice that I had.

06:56.748 --> 06:59.911
I sympathize
with your situation.

07:01.482 --> 07:03.270
What can you tell me?

07:04.905 --> 07:08.737
There's this wiry Vato named Quazi,
works out of the back of his garage.

07:08.777 --> 07:11.903
He's Armadillo's personal paper boy
from down south.

07:11.943 --> 07:15.390
Prints his visas,
his green cards.

07:15.558 --> 07:18.459
You get him.
You get Armadillo.

07:21.381 --> 07:23.169
Thanks.

07:24.836 --> 07:26.624
Hey.

07:27.778 --> 07:30.712
Jail's too good for him.

07:42.686 --> 07:46.007
You fillin' out back orders
for Ellis Island, Quazi?

07:46.047 --> 07:48.118
Where's Armadillo?

08:01.754 --> 08:03.668
–Put your hand in here.
–Que?

08:05.337 --> 08:08.369
Do it.

08:10.039 --> 08:11.730
No, no, no!

08:11.926 --> 08:13.649
No, no, no!
Aaah!

08:13.846 --> 08:16.463
Armadillo, ¿dónde está?

08:17.877 --> 08:19.306
¿Dónde?

08:19.477 --> 08:22.640
¿Dónde?

08:22.772 --> 08:25.935
Well?

08:26.099 --> 08:30.189
He says he's in some house
in the Little Jewel.

08:31.793 --> 08:33.549
We need an address,
amigo.

08:33.744 --> 08:36.013
This was a message,
not a mugging.

08:36.176 --> 08:39.399
Tell me about it. They left the wallet,
a watch, 50 bucks.

08:39.438 --> 08:40.974
Witnesses?

08:41.008 --> 08:44.134
That guy saw an Asian teenage male
running down the alleyway…

08:44.174 --> 08:45.767
into the back
parking lot.

08:45.807 --> 08:48.612
Red hooded sweatshirt,
black pants, tennis shoes.

08:48.652 --> 08:51.622
–What about the victim?
–His name's Lee Kusa.

08:51.852 --> 08:53.924
He's Thai national.
He's legal.

08:56.138 --> 08:58.018
Doesn't sound like
a gang thing.

08:58.058 --> 08:59.972
Wasn't a robbery.
It's weird.

09:01.449 --> 09:04.448
Cameras. Find out who they belong to,
whether or not they're working.

09:04.488 --> 09:09.636
You'd better hurry. The cheap places
only have them on a one or two-hour loop.

09:22.883 --> 09:24.639
Hey!

09:24.834 --> 09:26.427
¡Vámonos!

09:26.626 --> 09:28.830
Hey! Hey! Hey!

09:28.961 --> 09:31.513
Get your ass down.
Down!

09:31.713 --> 09:33.916
–It's okay.
–On the ground!

09:42.686 --> 09:45.107
Aaah! Shit!
Holy shit!

09:45.277 --> 09:47.545
Aaah!
Holy shit!

09:50.683 --> 09:53.617
–You all right, man?
–Crazy bitch!

09:55.002 --> 09:57.587
–Jesus, man!
–What?

09:57.786 --> 09:59.094
Jesus God!

10:01.177 --> 10:03.792
Forget the dog.
Let's go talk to the soldiers.

10:03.832 --> 10:05.358
Let's go.

10:05.527 --> 10:08.366
Caught the guy on camera
getting into his car. Ran the DMV.

10:08.406 --> 10:11.089
Got a 19-year-old Asian.
Lives here.

10:11.285 --> 10:13.805
–Great.
–Everybody be careful.

10:16.660 --> 10:19.245
Trust me,
it's not always this easy.

10:30.736 --> 10:32.459
Yes?

10:32.655 --> 10:36.516
Uh, Detective Wagenbach.
We're looking for a Malcolm Rama.

10:36.654 --> 10:38.923
He in shower,
cleaning up.

10:40.718 --> 10:42.309
–Where's Armadillo?
–No sé nada.

10:42.349 --> 10:45.130
–¿No sé nada? Go.
–All right.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.453
Aah!

10:53.706 --> 10:56.546
Same thing for you, Juanita.
Get up. Get up!

10:56.586 --> 10:58.276
Where's your boss?

10:58.472 --> 11:00.960
–No sé nada. No sé nada.
–Same wrong answer.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.520
–All right, that's it. You ready?
–Hey, hey, hey!

11:03.560 --> 11:06.206
–He doesn't know anything.
–We're just trying to jar his memory.

11:06.246 --> 11:08.155
Bring 'em back to the barn.

11:11.941 --> 11:13.664
You're lucky.

11:16.451 --> 11:18.174
I'm looking for Vic.

11:18.371 --> 11:21.058
Uh, Foster.
He's not here.

11:21.092 --> 11:23.993
I tried calling him.
He's not answering his cell.

11:24.033 --> 11:26.587
He's out making some arrests.
Probably turned it off.

11:26.627 --> 11:28.825
Is there something
I can help you with?

11:28.865 --> 11:31.223
–Someone broke into our house.
–When?

11:31.263 --> 11:32.986
This morning.

11:33.055 --> 11:35.895
I was dropping Matthew off
at the occupational therapist's…

11:35.935 --> 11:38.519
and when I came home, um,
the police were there.

11:38.559 --> 11:41.859
They broke the window,
and they set off the alarm.

11:45.243 --> 11:47.867
Um, come on.
Let's talk in private.

11:47.900 --> 11:50.482
Uh, Paula. You ever do
any baby-sitting?

11:50.522 --> 11:52.049
I work here, don't I?

11:52.250 --> 11:54.224
What's going on?

11:54.361 --> 11:57.232
–Someone burned off half
of Ronnie Gardocki's face.
–What?

11:57.272 --> 12:00.054
–Ronnie?
–In your husband's motel room.

12:01.144 --> 12:03.023
We think
they were targeting him.

12:03.063 --> 12:06.126
–Why would somebody want to…
–Didn't Vic tell you?

12:06.166 --> 12:08.557
That Armadillo was greenlighting
his team?

12:08.597 --> 12:10.735
Who's Armadillo?

12:10.869 --> 12:12.592
Uh…

12:12.788 --> 12:14.636
you know,
maybe it'd be easier…

12:14.676 --> 12:17.675
if you answered
some of my questions first.

12:18.802 --> 12:20.591
Okay.

12:24.273 --> 12:25.996
Hey, I talked to Aceveda.

12:26.097 --> 12:29.544
He said I can snag you for a few hours
to help with my case, if you're interested.

12:29.584 --> 12:31.209
–Yeah.
–Great.

12:31.407 --> 12:33.286
Heard about
your promotion snafu.

12:33.326 --> 12:35.049
–Sorry.
–Thanks.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.605
Maybe I can steer you
toward detective work.

12:37.645 --> 12:40.362
You seem to have
a knack for it.

12:40.556 --> 12:43.687
Where were you this morning
at 10:40, Malcolm?

12:43.820 --> 12:45.543
Russell Park.
I run there.

12:45.835 --> 12:50.338
You happen to step into a puddle
of human blood at the park, Malcolm?

12:50.378 --> 12:52.166
You're making a mistake.

12:53.353 --> 12:57.379
Maybe you didn't set out
to hurt the guy, but he's in a coma.

12:57.671 --> 13:01.169
Did he disrespect you?
You dating his daughter? What?

13:01.607 --> 13:03.262
You're going to jail
for this…

13:03.302 --> 13:05.022
whether you confess
or not…

13:05.062 --> 13:09.850
so for our own, uh, morbid curiosity,
you know, why'd you do it?

13:10.148 --> 13:12.155
I didn't.

13:14.851 --> 13:17.119
–We've got a problem.
–What?

13:17.282 --> 13:19.005
–He could walk.
–Come on.

13:19.202 --> 13:21.470
The bloody clothes?
The videotape?

13:21.601 --> 13:24.953
You know how many hours the average juror
spends watching soap operas every week?

13:24.993 --> 13:26.715
I don't know.
Four?

13:26.912 --> 13:28.570
17.8.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.490
Per week.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.982
Jurors like simple stories
they can understand.

13:33.022 --> 13:36.309
–He did it. We caught him.
Doesn't get simpler than that.
–But why did he do it?

13:36.349 --> 13:39.188
Unless he confesses,
at trial we'll be expected to know.

13:39.228 --> 13:43.027
The victim's blood runs straight out of
that kid's car right up to the front door.

13:43.067 --> 13:46.419
Maybe the jury figures we planted it,
sets this guy free to caddy for O.J.

13:46.459 --> 13:50.815
–But he did it.
–Until you know why,
a detective's job isn't done.

13:51.928 --> 13:54.768
–How long has Vic been in the motel?
–A few weeks.

13:54.808 --> 13:57.807
Uh, we're spending
some time apart.

13:57.943 --> 13:59.606
Oh.

13:59.640 --> 14:04.128
I thought maybe he was trying to make it
safer for you and the kids.

14:05.812 --> 14:07.692
Does he have
a post office box?

14:07.732 --> 14:09.455
What?

14:09.620 --> 14:12.491
A place where he might get mail
other than his home address.

14:12.531 --> 14:14.254
I don't think so.

14:14.418 --> 14:17.289
You ever seen any statements
from bank accounts…

14:17.329 --> 14:19.177
that you never knew
existed…

14:19.249 --> 14:21.128
maybe in
a family member's name?

14:21.168 --> 14:22.891
No.

14:23.088 --> 14:24.936
Any big purchases
this year?

14:25.007 --> 14:27.055
–Cars? Jewelry?
–No.

14:27.089 --> 14:31.210
After Matthew's tuition,
it's all we can do just to scrape by.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.385
–Matthew?
–Our son.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.212
He's autistic.
We, um…

14:35.246 --> 14:37.895
We send him to a special needs school.

14:38.412 --> 14:40.135
How much does that cost?

14:40.331 --> 14:42.054
A lot.

14:42.251 --> 14:44.487
On a cop's salary?

14:44.651 --> 14:46.373
Yeah, uh…

14:46.537 --> 14:50.299
–Vic works a ton of overtime.
–Is that what he tells you?

14:59.238 --> 15:02.010
Why are you asking me
about bank accounts…

15:02.118 --> 15:03.840
and P.O boxes?

15:04.037 --> 15:05.760
I just want to find out…

15:05.924 --> 15:08.284
why Armadillo's
targeting Vic's team…

15:08.324 --> 15:11.228
and I wanna make sure
nobody else gets hurt.

15:11.299 --> 15:13.022
Has Vic done something?

15:16.737 --> 15:18.362
In you go.

15:20.672 --> 15:22.875
–Step back, asshole.
–Hey.

15:31.229 --> 15:34.294
Hey, is everything
cool with you?

15:34.428 --> 15:36.028
Yeah.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.163
You seem like
you're holdin' back a little bit.

15:40.826 --> 15:43.186
We got a thousand eyes
on us right now.

15:43.226 --> 15:46.856
Calling more attention
by cracking skulls doesn't help.

15:54.263 --> 15:56.683
–You wanna change the page?
–Cassie?

15:56.887 --> 15:58.766
What are you doing here,
honey?

15:58.806 --> 16:01.172
–Mommy brought us.
–Why?

16:01.333 --> 16:03.536
Someone
smashed our window.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.456
Where's Mommy now?

16:07.540 --> 16:10.986
Someone broke into the house?
Are you okay?

16:20.880 --> 16:22.570
All right.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.832
–Talk to me.
–Why don't you talk?

16:25.966 --> 16:28.807
Somebody's trying to kill you.
They came to our house.

16:28.847 --> 16:32.133
I had a security system
put in to protect you. It worked.

16:32.173 --> 16:35.364
What if I'd been picking one of them
up from school?

16:35.404 --> 16:38.051
I had a P.I watching you
and the children.

16:38.091 --> 16:39.814
–What?
–To be safe.

16:40.011 --> 16:42.465
–Without telling me?
–I didn't want to scare you.

16:42.505 --> 16:45.057
You just didn't want to admit
to what you've been doing.

16:45.097 --> 16:46.945
What did Claudette
tell you?

16:47.016 --> 16:49.856
Were you involved
with some drug dealer who died?

16:49.896 --> 16:51.684
–Jesus Christ…
–Were you?

16:52.775 --> 16:54.623
Sometimes
out on the street…

16:54.694 --> 16:57.086
you gotta make deals
to make bigger arrests.

16:57.126 --> 16:59.933
Now, Claudette got you
all worked up over nothin'

16:59.973 --> 17:02.364
I got more truth from her
in ten minutes…

17:02.404 --> 17:04.780
than I've gotten from you
in a year.

17:04.805 --> 17:07.378
How are we paying
for Matthew's school?

17:10.273 --> 17:13.022
You want me to go
find out from her?

17:14.848 --> 17:17.084
I love my kids…

17:17.248 --> 17:19.866
and I want
a future for them.

17:20.127 --> 17:24.382
So right now I really need you to step up
and be on my side.

17:31.772 --> 17:33.495
Mom,
did you see Daddy?

17:33.787 --> 17:36.531
Yeah. You know what?
Dad's busy with work right now.

17:36.571 --> 17:38.228
Okay? Um…

17:38.426 --> 17:40.868
Maybe we'll see him later.
All right?

18:01.332 --> 18:05.610
I've got a team member in the burn unit,
the guy who did it out on the street…

18:05.650 --> 18:08.171
and you think now is a good time
to screw with my family?

18:08.211 --> 18:11.273
I think Armadillo went to your house
looking for you, Vic.

18:11.313 --> 18:13.802
Lucky your wife and kids
didn't end up in the burn ward.

18:13.842 --> 18:17.637
–My family's off limits.
–You tell that to Armadillo.

18:18.159 --> 18:20.298
I'm telling you!

18:27.980 --> 18:30.663
I recommended,
weeks ago…

18:30.859 --> 18:34.627
that the Justice Department provide protective
surveillance for the Strike Team.

18:34.667 --> 18:36.866
They didn't want it.
It's a pride thing.

18:36.906 --> 18:39.713
My report to the city council
is due next month.

18:39.753 --> 18:42.459
And I'm sure you'll be
fair and accurate.

18:44.743 --> 18:46.466
You wanted to see me?

18:46.663 --> 18:48.386
I contacted Justice.

18:48.582 --> 18:50.686
Starting tomorrow,
they're assigned to your team…

18:50.726 --> 18:52.706
until Armadillo
is in custody.

18:53.605 --> 18:55.328
–What?
–Why?

18:55.557 --> 18:58.524
This is for your own good.
We can't see anyone else getting hurt.

18:58.564 --> 19:01.403
–Who are you to dictate how I work?
–Excuse me?

19:01.443 --> 19:03.166
Vic.

19:03.234 --> 19:06.202
If I were you, I'd be careful about
the next thing you say.

19:06.242 --> 19:09.401
I can't afford to be handcuffed
by some… part-timer…

19:09.441 --> 19:11.320
who thinks she knows
what's right.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.083
I am
a trained litigator…

19:13.280 --> 19:15.734
with a master's
in criminal justice.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.910
Then stay
in the classroom.

19:18.047 --> 19:19.769
The, uh, cripple called.

19:19.966 --> 19:21.880
I mean,
the handicapped… guy…

19:21.885 --> 19:23.608
called.

19:28.316 --> 19:30.039
Hey, Dutch.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.867
Dutch!

19:31.901 --> 19:35.538
City workers found this in a storm drain
a half a mile from the alley.

19:35.578 --> 19:37.266
Looks like our weapon
to me.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.985
–Prints?
–No, but there's a lot of hair and blood.

19:40.025 --> 19:41.906
Check out these etchings.
They're Thai.

19:41.946 --> 19:44.943
I checked out the Thai cultural center
where he volunteers at.

19:44.983 --> 19:48.782
This was stolen from there a couple
of days ago. Maybe that'll help with motive.

19:48.822 --> 19:50.545
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

19:54.581 --> 19:56.304
Damn it!

19:56.500 --> 19:58.223
What happened?

19:58.420 --> 20:00.619
I guess the boss
must've got my memo.

20:00.659 --> 20:02.382
Armadillo?

20:02.579 --> 20:06.281
Dude that did this had Mexican prison ink.
Thick dialect.

20:06.321 --> 20:08.076
One of them imports.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.624
–Took my goddamn wheelchair.
How wrong is that?
–Did you get a name?

20:11.664 --> 20:15.360
Better than that. Got the plate.
Blue Ford pickup truck.

20:16.655 --> 20:19.337
God, Van Bro.

20:19.534 --> 20:21.922
Nice work, Van Bro.
Sit tight.

20:22.093 --> 20:25.129
–Help is on the way.
–And a new set of wheels.

20:25.196 --> 20:27.367
Somethin' sporty.

20:31.946 --> 20:34.850
–Hands on the wheel. Now.
–Don't even twitch, bitch.

20:34.890 --> 20:37.889
–Out.
–On the head, Jose. Let's go. Let's go!

20:38.025 --> 20:40.129
Get up there.

20:44.807 --> 20:47.676
We're looking for Armadillo. Any tips?

20:47.782 --> 20:50.818
Oh, I'm gettin' so tired
of playing this game.

20:50.853 --> 20:53.373
Here.

20:53.572 --> 20:57.052
–Here.
–Okay, okay, okay! I know where he is.

20:57.284 --> 20:59.611
Lem, you ride with him.
We'll follow you.

20:59.651 --> 21:01.530
Enjoy the wheelchair,
asshole.

21:01.570 --> 21:03.261
Get in.

21:04.673 --> 21:06.305
He was in line.

21:06.338 --> 21:09.848
Guy behind him sprayed something
in his face with an aerosol can.

21:09.888 --> 21:11.583
Looked like bug spray.

21:11.616 --> 21:14.422
–Was there an argument?
–Well, he always takes forever to order.

21:14.462 --> 21:17.301
So, uh, so aerosol guy
wanted him to hurry up.

21:17.341 --> 21:20.181
When he didn't, the dude said,
“You're buggin' me.”

21:20.221 --> 21:22.612
Psst… right in the eyes.
Took off that way.

21:22.652 --> 21:26.707
–I was just trying to order.
–Every day you hold up my goddamn line.

21:26.747 --> 21:30.227
–I was reading the menu!
–Hot dogs, hamburgers. That's it, you idiot!

21:30.267 --> 21:31.990
Hey!

21:32.186 --> 21:34.574
–Jerk-off!
–Homo! Goddamn it!

21:39.512 --> 21:41.300
–You married?
–Yeah.

21:41.495 --> 21:44.814
–I'm gettin' ready
to take the plunge myself.
–Good for you.

21:44.854 --> 21:47.952
–You got any kids?
–Yeah, I got a boy.

21:48.085 --> 21:50.925
You don't want him
to see you in jail, do you?

21:50.965 --> 21:52.688
–No.
–Good.

21:52.724 --> 21:55.496
So, tell me about
the guy who sprayed you.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.763
He's on the top floor.
Back unit.

21:58.803 --> 22:01.546
He says Armadillo's got a few guys,
and they're probably packing.

22:01.586 --> 22:05.810
Get the collaterals out of here.
Take the truck, cover the back.

22:18.893 --> 22:21.227
¿Qué pasa?

22:21.388 --> 22:24.834
You, uh, know much
about Thai culture, Malcolm?

22:26.123 --> 22:27.842
I'm not really into
my roots.

22:27.882 --> 22:31.841
Yet you volunteer at the Thai
cultural center two nights a week.

22:31.881 --> 22:34.270
It's a good place
to meet girls.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.163
Yeah.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.228
And to, uh, pick up
antique artifacts.

22:41.254 --> 22:44.450
This was stolen from there
a couple of days ago…

22:44.837 --> 22:47.138
from a room
you had access to.

22:48.676 --> 22:52.024
You see these, uh,
ornate little symbols?

22:52.196 --> 22:53.984
They represent, uh…

22:56.035 --> 22:58.620
“fertility, family,
bloodlines.”

22:58.817 --> 23:00.475
Okay.

23:00.673 --> 23:02.553
–How come you never asked his name?
–Who?

23:02.593 --> 23:05.462
The old man you beat up.
You wanna hear it?

23:05.600 --> 23:07.323
His last name was Kusa.

23:07.519 --> 23:11.286
Came over from Thailand a couple of years ago.
Kusa. Am I pronouncing that right?

23:11.326 --> 23:13.173
–I guess.
–How would you say it?

23:13.213 --> 23:16.561
–I wouldn't.
–So you won't even say his name.

23:18.172 --> 23:20.680
We drop smoke,
head in the front door.

23:20.764 --> 23:23.998
Armadillo runs out the back,
Lem's there waiting.

23:24.123 --> 23:26.839
Let's go. Go…

23:27.034 --> 23:29.335
Wait a minute.

23:31.161 --> 23:34.029
What the hell is this?

23:34.168 --> 23:37.463
–What's goin' on?
–I'm unarmed!

23:41.590 --> 23:44.273
He called,
gave himself up!

23:44.469 --> 23:47.152
–Is that so?
–Turn around.

23:47.349 --> 23:50.121
Looks like he saw
the writin' on the wall.

23:56.626 --> 23:58.764
Somebody did a job
on his face.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.620
Well, it's an ugly world.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.343
More and more.

24:05.167 --> 24:07.207
I was attacked
by the bug spray guy.

24:07.247 --> 24:09.035
–When?
–Three days ago.

24:09.231 --> 24:12.070
I got your partner's card
from the hot dog stand.

24:12.110 --> 24:16.136
About the man who was attacked
with bug spray… he got me too.

24:16.492 --> 24:18.406
Serial sprayer?
That's weird.

24:18.412 --> 24:20.135
It's kind of a dumb case.

24:20.331 --> 24:22.054
He is hurting people,
but…

24:22.251 --> 24:24.130
No, same principle
as a killer.

24:24.170 --> 24:27.552
Driven by inadequacy
and frustration.

24:27.625 --> 24:31.040
One acts out with insecticide,
the other with deadly force.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.868
Why don't you run with it?

24:33.959 --> 24:35.682
–Me?
–We're swamped today.

24:35.879 --> 24:38.206
Be a while before a detective
can look into it.

24:38.246 --> 24:41.277
–I don't know.
–Sure you do. You've got great instincts.

24:41.317 --> 24:43.040
Really?

24:43.173 --> 24:45.532
Calling the cultural center
about that scepter?

24:45.572 --> 24:48.476
I think it's gonna be
the key to finding motive.

24:48.516 --> 24:50.430
Bug spray guy's yours,
right?

24:50.531 --> 24:52.254
Yeah.

24:52.450 --> 24:54.654
Where would you start?

24:56.225 --> 24:59.064
Both attacks took place
within a couple blocks.

24:59.104 --> 25:01.876
–He probably lives within the area.
–Good.

25:02.943 --> 25:05.366
I could call the drug stores,
hardware places…

25:05.406 --> 25:08.694
see if anyone matching our description
bought any bug spray lately.

25:08.734 --> 25:10.912
Sounds like
detective work to me.

25:12.797 --> 25:15.636
Come on, Claudette.
Let me go inside with you, back you up.

25:15.676 --> 25:18.515
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I don't need the help.

25:18.555 --> 25:20.435
We both been
working this case.

25:20.475 --> 25:25.491
–Between what you and I know,
we can trip him up.
–I'm gonna try this alone.

25:28.281 --> 25:30.517
If you can't
make up your mind…

25:30.680 --> 25:32.981
I'll ask Lanie
to make the call.

25:34.839 --> 25:37.140
Give her
the facts of the case.

25:46.356 --> 25:49.674
You've got a lot of your plate.
Where'd you find the time?

25:49.714 --> 25:51.437
Drug trafficking…

25:51.634 --> 25:53.994
consolidating a Mexican power base,
murder.

25:54.034 --> 25:56.040
Am I leaving anything out?

25:56.176 --> 25:58.445
Oh, yeah.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.615
Juvenile rape.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.338
So you say.

26:03.567 --> 26:07.725
Let's hope that genius I.Q
means you know how to help yourself.

26:07.853 --> 26:10.214
We've got you on tape
making a death threat.

26:10.254 --> 26:12.168
That could be anyone's voice.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.082
I'll challenge it in court.

26:14.188 --> 26:18.464
What about the testimony of a cop
with his own grill mark?

26:18.635 --> 26:21.384
You gonna challenge that too?

26:22.634 --> 26:24.706
What happened to your face?

26:24.841 --> 26:26.815
You used to be
so pretty.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.866
I'll only
give my confession…

26:28.968 --> 26:30.909
to Detective Mackey.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.291
You don't make demands.
Not to me.

26:35.238 --> 26:37.342
I speak to Mackey…

26:37.478 --> 26:39.266
or my lawyer.

27:10.717 --> 27:12.658
I want to talk alone.

27:22.553 --> 27:25.040
The first few weeks
are the worst.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.412
Then the skin gets hard.

27:28.535 --> 27:31.088
The stinging goes away.

27:31.286 --> 27:33.009
It's time for me to leave.

27:33.206 --> 27:36.374
You should have left
when I gave you the chance.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.536
My business here is done.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.423
Everything's in place.

27:41.620 --> 27:44.062
Now you're going to
help me get home.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.384
–Help you?
–You have no choice.

27:46.546 --> 27:50.123
The second you did this to me,
you gave me control.

27:50.385 --> 27:53.576
So, unless you and your men
want a cell next to mine…

27:53.616 --> 27:55.339
you'll do what I say.

27:55.535 --> 27:57.977
Get your man
to recant his statement…

27:58.095 --> 28:01.158
and get me out of here
long enough to cross the border…

28:01.198 --> 28:02.921
we'll call it even.

28:03.117 --> 28:05.189
What about
the people you burned…

28:05.229 --> 28:07.108
and that little girl
you raped?

28:07.148 --> 28:08.806
Sometimes…

28:09.004 --> 28:10.727
life isn't fair.

28:27.719 --> 28:30.336
You wanted me to hurt you.

28:31.430 --> 28:33.437
Every scar is a victory.

28:34.724 --> 28:36.513
This is just my biggest.

29:18.905 --> 29:20.628
What'd he say?

29:20.824 --> 29:22.547
He just wanted
to gloat.

29:22.744 --> 29:24.467
Guess it's my turn.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.451
He wants to
see his lawyer.

29:28.022 --> 29:29.931
The interrogation's over.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.329
Oh, there he is.

29:40.819 --> 29:42.542
Excuse me.

29:42.738 --> 29:45.966
–Mr Jarvis Stanley?
–Yeah.

29:47.249 --> 29:49.163
–Let me see your hands.
–Why?

29:49.296 --> 29:51.303
I said
let me see your hands.

29:54.095 --> 29:58.187
Put your hands on top of your head
and step away from the car.

30:05.964 --> 30:08.613
Got a pest problem.
It's illegal to carry bug spray?

30:08.653 --> 30:11.914
It is when you're trying
to blind people with it.

30:12.298 --> 30:14.021
They were all buggin' me.

30:14.218 --> 30:16.606
Ahh. It's not like
I killed anyone.

30:16.809 --> 30:19.648
Actually, it's an assault
with a deadly weapon.

30:19.688 --> 30:22.338
Bug spray's poison.
That's a felony.

30:22.568 --> 30:24.548
Now you're
startin' to bug me.

30:29.157 --> 30:30.880
–He's got me.
–No.

30:31.077 --> 30:33.340
No way.
This does not end like this.

30:33.380 --> 30:35.690
He's gonna play
the brutality card…

30:35.780 --> 30:38.619
if I don't get Ronnie to recant
and set him loose.

30:38.659 --> 30:40.570
–Then that's what we gotta do.
–No.

30:40.610 --> 30:43.293
I couldn't look Ronnie
in the eye.

30:48.991 --> 30:50.998
I did this.

30:53.919 --> 30:57.529
I'll take all the heat,
make sure you guys get a pass.

30:58.078 --> 31:00.916
Come on.
You could be lookin' at jail time.

31:02.908 --> 31:05.363
I barely saw my kids
today.

31:10.042 --> 31:12.343
I'm gonna go
give 'em a call.

31:20.567 --> 31:22.355
What are we gonna do?

31:23.991 --> 31:25.839
What are we gonna do,
Shane?

31:25.910 --> 31:27.600
I'm thinkin'.

31:27.830 --> 31:29.520
God!

31:29.749 --> 31:31.505
Shit!

31:36.499 --> 31:38.800
–Where we goin'?
–To make a deal.

31:42.226 --> 31:46.280
Your family comes from the area in northern
Thailand known as the Hilltribe region…

31:46.320 --> 31:48.719
known for its
tribal wars.

31:48.753 --> 31:53.222
In fact, your family's been feuding
with another clan for over 800 years.

31:53.262 --> 31:55.269
–Not me.
–Rape.

31:55.406 --> 31:56.834
Torture. Genocide.

31:57.005 --> 31:59.939
That's a pretty gnarly
family tree.

32:00.076 --> 32:02.147
The other family's name
is Kusa.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.995
And now I know why
you beat him into a coma.

32:05.035 --> 32:08.001
And now a jury's
gonna know it too.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.501
My dad was pissed.

32:15.944 --> 32:17.667
Your dad.

32:17.863 --> 32:21.955
Old guy comes into the center
and signed the guest book… Kusa.

32:23.686 --> 32:26.435
So I told my dad,
you know, as a joke.

32:28.676 --> 32:30.788
But he went crazy.

32:30.821 --> 32:35.045
Starts talking about killing this guy,
like, really killing him.

32:35.971 --> 32:37.661
So I figure…

32:37.890 --> 32:40.345
I'd scare Kusa away first…

32:40.385 --> 32:43.949
act like I was protecting
the family name or whatever.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.884
Get him to leave
the neighborhood.

32:48.511 --> 32:51.925
And the scepter was to…
drive the point home.

32:52.350 --> 32:56.310
I followed him outside the center,
and I told him who I was.

32:58.908 --> 33:00.756
Before I could say anything…

33:00.827 --> 33:02.675
the old freak
spits in my face.

33:02.715 --> 33:06.162
He starts whaling on me,
screaming at me in Thai.

33:08.985 --> 33:11.701
I only hit him back
to protect myself.

33:12.856 --> 33:16.051
He was half dead,
hanging from a pole.

33:16.215 --> 33:18.383
That's a pretty tough sell
for self-defense.

33:18.423 --> 33:20.331
It was, at first.

33:21.589 --> 33:23.503
But something happened
to me.

33:26.132 --> 33:27.593
Blood.

33:28.756 --> 33:31.472
I never stood up
for my family before.

33:33.555 --> 33:35.496
I know it was wrong…

33:37.937 --> 33:40.686
but somehow it made sense.

33:50.350 --> 33:52.073
Yo, what'd he do?

33:52.269 --> 33:54.532
The guy walked right past us
smokin' weed.

33:54.572 --> 33:58.756
We didn't want to haul him in,
but we asked him to put it out…
blew smoke right in our face.

33:58.796 --> 34:00.835
Idiot.

34:08.585 --> 34:11.137
–Now we know the “why.”
–Yeah.

34:11.335 --> 34:14.463
And I couldn't have done it without you.
Thanks.

34:14.503 --> 34:18.302
You know, up until now I was really
focused on getting ahead on the street.

34:18.342 --> 34:21.179
But after seeing
the whole detective angle…

34:21.188 --> 34:24.188
I don't know, it just kinda
felt like we were partners.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.748
There was a real connection there.
Good back and forth.

34:26.788 --> 34:28.511
–Yeah.
–You were great.

34:28.708 --> 34:31.128
Thanks.

34:31.297 --> 34:33.436
What?

34:37.985 --> 34:41.400
Um, K… Uh, Kim's making me dinner tonight.
I've got to, uh…

34:41.440 --> 34:44.090
I have a lot of…
Oh, shit.

34:48.862 --> 34:50.585
What's going on?

34:50.781 --> 34:52.570
–Oh, my God.
–What?

34:53.661 --> 34:56.148
I just…

34:56.315 --> 34:58.038
I almost kissed Dutch.

34:58.235 --> 34:59.958
Oh, my God.
Why?

35:00.123 --> 35:03.286
I don't know. It was a momentary lapse.

35:03.481 --> 35:05.204
Was he devastated?

35:05.401 --> 35:08.173
No. He's the one that
pulled away from me.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.483
–Oh, my God.
–I know. Shoot me.

35:13.399 --> 35:14.917
Keys!
Give me the keys!

35:15.062 --> 35:18.410
Hey, hey, hey!
Get away from him! Hey, hey!

35:18.581 --> 35:20.304
Hey, hey!
Get off of him!

35:22.388 --> 35:24.493
Hands up!
Hands up, everybody!

35:25.940 --> 35:28.273
Watch the knife!
Call a medic!

35:28.434 --> 35:29.994
I'm calling!

35:34.833 --> 35:36.556
On the wall.

35:36.753 --> 35:39.469
Let's search 'em nicely.
Let's go.

35:39.664 --> 35:41.354
Jesus Christ!

35:41.551 --> 35:43.493
Who searched that guy?

35:43.630 --> 35:45.702
–I did.
–How could you miss a knife that size?

35:45.742 --> 35:48.517
It wasn't on him when I frisked him
after the arrest.

35:48.557 --> 35:50.531
Upstairs.

35:57.066 --> 35:58.855
Nope.

36:14.502 --> 36:16.606
What happened?

36:16.741 --> 36:18.464
Los Mag O.G
with a grudge.

36:18.757 --> 36:21.855
Stabbed him nine times.
Won't say why.

36:23.108 --> 36:24.634
Jesus.

36:24.803 --> 36:26.526
Come on, let's go.

36:28.546 --> 36:30.171
Unbelievable, huh?

36:42.910 --> 36:45.053
Armadillo Quintero.

36:45.087 --> 36:48.596
I thought maybe you might like that
for your personal files.

36:48.636 --> 36:51.672
This case is closed.
File it where it belongs.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.653
You wanna know
what I think happened?

36:57.722 --> 37:00.721
Vic was Tio's drug landlord,
gave him protection.

37:00.761 --> 37:03.568
Tio gave him favors
and a cut of the business.

37:03.608 --> 37:06.928
When Armadillo killed Tio,
Vic fried his face on the grill…

37:06.968 --> 37:09.938
and that's why he didn't
want me to find him.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.937
Why'd you get in my way?

37:20.307 --> 37:22.608
I made a mistake.

37:23.891 --> 37:25.898
You just now
realizing that?

37:31.472 --> 37:33.512
Oops, sorry.

37:44.749 --> 37:46.729
I heard
about your suspension.

37:47.788 --> 37:50.853
I searched that guy
from head to toe.

37:50.987 --> 37:52.710
Call your P.B.A rep.

37:52.907 --> 37:55.349
Get your side of the story
on record.

37:56.234 --> 37:58.437
Is all of this a joke, Vic?

37:58.601 --> 38:00.673
–What?
–Everything.

38:02.025 --> 38:04.731
Everything that's
happening to me lately.

38:06.343 --> 38:08.611
You're a good cop, Danny.

38:14.341 --> 38:16.129
I miss you.

38:18.180 --> 38:20.416
I know.

38:20.579 --> 38:23.328
I just can't act on that
right now.

38:26.978 --> 38:28.984
Right.

38:39.742 --> 38:41.564
Did you get 'em
to sleep?

38:46.556 --> 38:48.947
I got a guy to replace
the window tomorrow.

38:48.987 --> 38:50.867
I've got things to do
tomorrow.

38:50.907 --> 38:53.746
I'll have 'em call ahead,
make sure you're at home.

38:53.786 --> 38:57.137
Just leave me his number.
I'll take care of it myself.

38:57.177 --> 38:58.965
Okay.

39:00.984 --> 39:03.823
Listen, I… I gotta have
more time with the kids.

39:03.863 --> 39:07.625
Not just dinners. I… I need some mornings,
some weekends.

39:10.229 --> 39:13.006
Hey, they're my kids too. If I wanna
see them more, I'm gonna see them.

39:13.046 --> 39:17.611
You can't even spend three dinners a week,
and now you want more time?

39:17.651 --> 39:19.439
Goddamn it,
don't do this.

39:22.834 --> 39:24.880
I'm gonna make more time.
Okay?

39:26.865 --> 39:29.003
I gotta get back to basics.

39:29.136 --> 39:32.169
Start by bein'
a good dad again.

39:34.447 --> 39:37.285
–You can't promise them that.
–I'm serious.

39:41.133 --> 39:42.921
I gotta make some changes.

39:49.611 --> 39:51.987
Leave the number
for the window guy.

39:54.473 --> 39:56.833
Little Pop heads back
to Pelican Bay…

39:56.873 --> 39:59.583
where he has more respect and business
than he ever did before.

39:59.623 --> 40:03.847
We're gonna cover his mom's expenses
until after the sentencing.

40:06.597 --> 40:09.373
I'll never forget
what you guys did for me.

40:09.413 --> 40:11.617
Don't worry.
We won't let you.

40:16.291 --> 40:18.170
Tell Ronnie
I'll see him tomorrow.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.868
Enjoy the painting.

40:20.066 --> 40:22.651
Not a problem.

40:22.850 --> 40:24.988
Take it easy.
Night, boss.

40:38.525 --> 40:40.313
We both know…

40:42.204 --> 40:44.691
what happened to Ronnie…

40:45.851 --> 40:47.639
that's on you.

40:48.826 --> 40:50.614
It's all on you.

41:17.714 --> 41:19.437
–Yeah.
–You sure?

41:23.825 --> 41:26.126
That's him.

09:00:00.000 --> 09:00:01.000
