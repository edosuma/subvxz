WEBVTT

00:22.898 --> 00:24.733
Hand him to me. Bless you.

00:28.654 --> 00:31.073
Alison, put that away, please.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.005
Come on.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.634
Come on.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.505
Why would you throw that thing at her?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.094
I didn't want to.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.723
I didn't want to kill her.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.685
I didn't know it was going to explode.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.189
A Molotov cocktail?

01:53.488 --> 01:54.948
I wanted you to love me.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.165
It sounds stupid, but you loved Nathalie.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.173
No.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.763
It was a mission.
Can't you understand that?

02:19.765 --> 02:22.226
It was the only way
to get you out of the group.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.770
Okay, we played...

02:26.021 --> 02:27.981
We played a dirty game with you guys.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.485
But you had to believe it.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.835
And you?

02:50.254 --> 02:51.672
What did you want?

04:44.493 --> 04:46.995
It's time to go to school.
You want to bring it to school?

04:46.995 --> 04:48.539
- Yes.
- Turn it off.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.541
You want to put it in your bag? Okay.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.585
You can play with it later.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.213
Which side do you want your bag?

04:57.089 --> 04:58.298
This side?

04:59.132 --> 05:01.468
All right, let's go. You coming?

05:03.178 --> 05:04.596
Is Elena over here?

05:05.389 --> 05:08.809
You're going to say goodbye to me
through the window, right?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.561
Blow me a kiss like this, okay?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.939
I'm sorry, madam.
He hid his coat somewhere.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.482
No worries. Let's go.

05:15.482 --> 05:17.568
- I hid it!
- Yes, you hid it.

05:17.568 --> 05:21.196
Come on. Let's go. Off to school.
Let me open that for you.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.156
- Have a good day, madam.
- Have a good day.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.372
Say bye to Mommy. See you soon.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.166
I'll wait for you by the window.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.728
We're off to school. Watch out
for your little feet. There you go.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.356
A tiger. Can you see the beautiful tiger?

05:57.357 --> 05:58.567
It's Daddy.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.028
What does he have? What a pretty tiger.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.571
- Oh, what a lovely tiger.
- A tiger.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.908
Do you like it? You like it? Come.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.621
- The driver will drop you off at school.
- Very well, sir. Very well.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.248
Be careful with the tiger.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.837
Pierre! Pierre!

06:19.546 --> 06:20.756
Elena!

06:21.798 --> 06:22.966
Elena!

06:25.552 --> 06:26.762
Didier!

06:34.019 --> 06:36.355
Pierre! Pierre!

06:36.355 --> 06:38.106
What are you doing?
Where are you taking him?

06:38.106 --> 06:39.983
- I sent him off to see the seaside.
- By himself?

06:39.983 --> 06:42.402
With his nanny.
Don't worry. It's only for a day.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.906
The two of us have a meeting in London.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.700
I already told you
I won't give you my passwords.

06:49.952 --> 06:51.328
It's out of the question.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.872
That was before Pierre was sent off
to the seaside.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.935
I'm okay.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.994
So you want to tell me what happened?

08:15.245 --> 08:16.288
I will.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.248
Where's Kim?

08:18.248 --> 08:21.418
Oh, she's gone back to her mother's.
It's not exactly the--

08:24.546 --> 08:25.756
Alison.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.222
Samir, Myriam, Albert.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.640
Hey.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.188
What the hell is he doing here?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.650
- Can you call Richard?
- Answer me.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.319
Albert, this is not the time.

08:47.319 --> 08:49.780
They're freezing cold.
Their baby needs changing.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.615
And it's not safe for us here.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.411
Take them to our room.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.247
Thank you.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.325
What about these?

09:35.325 --> 09:38.036
- Yeah, that's great. Thank you.
- Yeah.

09:39.705 --> 09:40.914
Here.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.833
This might work for the moment.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.252
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.216
So is this why you abandoned me?

11:15.217 --> 11:16.802
To steal my records?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.188
What you doing?

11:32.484 --> 11:33.735
Get the fuck out of my--

11:35.487 --> 11:37.781
Stop! Gabriel!

11:37.781 --> 11:39.575
Gabriel, stop!

11:40.826 --> 11:42.536
I can't take it anymore!
I can't take it anymore!

11:42.536 --> 11:43.453
Wait... It's...

11:43.453 --> 11:46.290
For the past 20 years,
I've seen you everywhere. Get out!

11:46.290 --> 11:48.834
Get out! Get lost!

11:48.834 --> 11:50.169
Get out of here!

11:54.590 --> 11:56.300
May God protect you.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.858
I think the road is clear.

12:45.516 --> 12:47.100
How did you get back in?

12:48.894 --> 12:51.104
I had men stationed
at every beach in Kent.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.732
Didn't go as planned.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.537
<i>Antropa's attack plans.</i>

13:09.540 --> 13:11.875
It's protected, but Samir can open it.

13:16.046 --> 13:18.215
How did you manage to get him back?

13:18.799 --> 13:19.800
Delage.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.179
The French were afraid
we wouldn't make it, so he came along.

13:24.763 --> 13:25.973
The French?

13:26.932 --> 13:30.018
DGSE. They made a copy of the key.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.689
Are you serious?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.819
You allowed the French
to have access to this?

13:38.819 --> 13:40.904
They told me we had a mole.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.782
Someone inside our government
is working with Antropa.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.326
Who?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.746
They don't know.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.416
But we have Samir.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.210
He said he'd help with everything.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.172
What does he want?

14:02.885 --> 14:04.011
Security.

14:07.139 --> 14:08.557
I can provide that.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.608
There's one more thing
the DGSE made me promise.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.423
What did you tell
the people working for Antropa?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.884
I don't have any passwords of value.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.595
- I only have minor access, that's it.
- Stop bullshitting.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.474
We only need an access point into
the EU cybersecurity shield, that's all.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.565
How could you involve your son
in this mess?

15:08.158 --> 15:10.160
I want to talk to Pierre. Right now.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.881
- It's Mom.
- Mommy!

15:22.881 --> 15:25.133
- Are you okay, sweetheart?
- Mommy!

15:25.133 --> 15:27.344
- Hello, Mommy!
- Hello, Mommy.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.512
Is everything all right?

15:28.512 --> 15:30.138
- Yes.
- We have to go now.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.557
Love you, my little man.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.851
- Bye! Okay!
- Thank you.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.232
Who was that?

15:42.860 --> 15:45.863
Didier, who is the man
with Elena and Pierre? I'm talking to you.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.242
A guardian angel.

15:53.704 --> 15:55.122
You disgust me.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.549
Spoke to your father.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.887
- How is he?
- He's better. He's been worried about you.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.391
I'm sorry about the French, Richard.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.936
- I really didn't have a choice.
- I know.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.231
I know.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.235
You did great.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.510
Ms. Saint Roch.

16:50.219 --> 16:52.137
Thank you for your cooperation.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.889
Dumas is the one you should thank.

16:54.431 --> 16:57.434
It was his idea to put a spyware
on Sabine's computer.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.480
This man works for you?

17:02.356 --> 17:05.150
On this operation, yes.

17:06.359 --> 17:10.531
These documents authorize us
to deport Louseau and Taraud.

17:10.531 --> 17:13.116
Taraud is very close to our president.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.243
We can't risk a public arrest.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.997
I've just spotted him and Louseau
entering the Antropa headquarters.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.709
Got a tap on their phones.
They're currently here.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.255
According to our intel,
they've stepped up security,

17:26.255 --> 17:29.174
and the French CEO, Francis Miller,
is flying in tonight.

17:29.675 --> 17:30.843
Who is that?

17:30.843 --> 17:33.262
Bob Foret.
He's the one who's organized the meeting.

17:33.262 --> 17:34.888
So what's the plan?

17:34.888 --> 17:38.684
We want the mole. At a meeting like this,
it's likely they'll show up too.

17:39.268 --> 17:41.728
If I understand correctly,
they won't make a move.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.527
So, you won't make a move
before they show up?

17:48.527 --> 17:50.070
We'll only get one shot at this.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.867
Under no circumstance
are you to intervene.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.034
Do you understand?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.413
Of course.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.843
We're not out of the woods yet.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.642
This isn't working.
That woman, Hobbs, is too young.

18:20.642 --> 18:23.061
It's her first big operation,
and she's scared of screwing it up.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.397
It's clear that she doesn't give a shit
about Taraud.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.482
But if we keep waiting,
he'll end up escaping.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.735
Okay.

18:31.737 --> 18:34.114
Get yourself equipped and head out.

18:34.865 --> 18:37.242
Oh, so I'm the one
that has to extract Taraud now?

18:54.009 --> 18:55.636
What are you going to tell the Brits?

18:57.304 --> 18:58.639
Nothing.

18:59.681 --> 19:03.185
Infiltrate Antropa. Scope out the place
and keep an eye on Taraud.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.687
As soon as there's an opening,
we get him out of there.

19:05.687 --> 19:08.273
Whatever happens, we've got your back.

19:10.025 --> 19:11.401
Yes.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.336
We won't see you again?

19:32.464 --> 19:33.882
You'll be happy here.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.468
I promise.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.182
Goodbye.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.272
Did you sleep with him?

20:32.691 --> 20:33.859
No.

20:35.194 --> 20:37.154
Then why didn't you ever tell me
about him?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.709
Because I'm not a good person.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.005
I tried to be,

20:55.756 --> 20:57.007
for you.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.426
I really did.

21:04.348 --> 21:07.226
Anyway, I'll leave.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.102
Don't do that.

21:11.522 --> 21:12.689
Don't cut me out.

21:17.236 --> 21:18.820
You know I love you.

21:22.533 --> 21:24.159
You can't love me.

22:05.993 --> 22:08.370
We're pleased
to have you here, Mr. Miller.

22:08.912 --> 22:10.122
This way.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.090
I have some bad news, Bob.

22:21.300 --> 22:24.678
- We won't be able to save Antropa.
- What? But we're about to sign.

22:26.305 --> 22:27.973
No. My associate called me.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.226
- The British can no longer sign with us.
- Why?

22:33.228 --> 22:35.898
Because the DGSE found the USB key,
unlike you.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.566
They even made a copy of it.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.776
Antropa's name is everywhere on it.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.279
On every attack, counterattack

22:42.279 --> 22:44.865
and "solution" we've sold
over the past ten years.

22:46.950 --> 22:51.538
We have 24 hours
to liquidate our assets and disappear.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.291
What about me?

22:55.542 --> 22:58.086
What about me?
What's going to happen to me?

23:02.841 --> 23:04.051
What about you?

23:05.135 --> 23:06.970
You're risking jail time, Bob.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.682
Your only option is an early retirement
in a tax haven.

23:10.682 --> 23:13.393
Once we're done with Taraud,
you're leaving with me.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.479
So all this for nothing?

23:15.479 --> 23:18.565
No. You're being overdramatic.
Don't be so pessimistic.

23:19.441 --> 23:22.236
We'll just transfer our assets
to another company name.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.948
The British will end up signing
without knowing it's us.

23:25.948 --> 23:28.325
And with the EU passwords,

23:30.077 --> 23:31.495
our future is guaranteed.

23:33.956 --> 23:35.666
So you're keeping him?

23:36.416 --> 23:38.585
No. He's been compromised.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.505
I would prefer he didn't know
until he's fulfilled his promises.

23:43.507 --> 23:48.887
I'm counting on you to transfer our assets
as quickly and as discreetly as possible.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.268
You'll be in charge until the end.

23:54.268 --> 23:56.186
Don't disappoint me, Bob.

23:58.647 --> 24:00.065
You can count on me.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.844
Richard.

24:28.844 --> 24:30.429
<i>Did you get some rest?</i>

24:30.929 --> 24:32.139
Yeah. Thanks.

24:32.139 --> 24:36.310
Thought you might want to know
Hobbs has got Antropa under surveillance.

24:36.852 --> 24:39.354
<i>But we're gonna wait for the mole
before moving in.</i>

24:39.354 --> 24:40.772
<i>Okay, I'll come in.</i>

24:40.772 --> 24:43.567
Meet me at the office.
Shahina's there with the lawyers.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.652
<i>We're going to nail these bastards.</i>

24:46.278 --> 24:47.487
On my way.

24:51.992 --> 24:53.660
I'll be back as quick as I can.

24:54.203 --> 24:55.412
What can I do to help?

24:55.412 --> 24:58.832
No, no. I don't want you caught up
in any of this.

24:59.333 --> 25:01.168
Darling, look...

25:03.587 --> 25:05.797
I guess we should postpone
the beach wedding, huh?

26:17.244 --> 26:19.079
- The Home Office, please.
- Certainly, ma'am.

27:01.330 --> 27:02.456
Let's go.

27:02.998 --> 27:06.627
I suppose Ms. Louseau would like
to return to Brussels as soon as possible

27:06.627 --> 27:08.587
to see her son, isn't that right?

27:09.171 --> 27:10.380
Absolutely.

27:11.048 --> 27:13.592
- Are you ready?
- Let's not waste time.

27:52.965 --> 27:54.424
I want to leave now.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.344
Wait. We have a problem.

27:57.845 --> 28:01.640
Ms. Louseau has just activated an alert
to the European Commission.

28:01.640 --> 28:02.724
How?

28:02.724 --> 28:05.811
That code she entered let them know
she was acting under duress.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.234
Did you stop it?

28:12.234 --> 28:15.445
Yes, but we have to start again
from scratch with a clean computer.

28:15.445 --> 28:17.072
This one's been tagged.

28:18.490 --> 28:19.491
- Take her.
- Go with her.

28:19.491 --> 28:20.826
Let go of me!

28:20.826 --> 28:23.662
- Don't leave me with them.
- Stop. You're making a fool of yourself.

28:23.662 --> 28:24.913
I don't care!

28:26.999 --> 28:28.876
- Go. I'll talk to them and join you later.
- Didier.

28:28.876 --> 28:30.460
- Go.
- Didier.

28:31.336 --> 28:32.629
You can't do this!

28:33.589 --> 28:34.840
Didier.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.801
Let go of me! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

28:37.801 --> 28:39.595
I know her. She'll calm down.

28:43.724 --> 28:44.975
Of course.

29:01.575 --> 29:03.202
We're good. I've found it.

29:03.202 --> 29:04.661
<i>Are you sure?</i>

29:13.462 --> 29:17.257
<i>All right. Get what we need
and get out as fast as you can. Got it?</i>

30:39.339 --> 30:40.799
Excuse me.

30:43.343 --> 30:45.554
The Home Office is in the other direction.

30:47.890 --> 30:48.891
Hey.

30:49.391 --> 30:50.475
Can you hear me?

30:53.353 --> 30:54.730
Hey!

31:09.244 --> 31:10.454
Fuck.

31:42.361 --> 31:43.695
The phone.

32:17.020 --> 32:19.314
They're moving out all their things.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.525
<i>What? Are you serious?</i>

32:24.278 --> 32:27.114
Tell the Brits to move their asses.
In two hours, there'll be no one left.

32:44.923 --> 32:46.800
Guys, I think we have the mole.

32:47.718 --> 32:49.011
It's Alison Rowdy.

32:49.720 --> 32:51.722
She just drove into Antropa.

32:55.350 --> 32:56.977
So are we good to go?

32:58.395 --> 33:00.189
I need to call the minister first.

33:12.242 --> 33:13.243
Hey, Gabriel.

33:14.161 --> 33:15.829
Wait. Something's going on.

33:23.504 --> 33:25.088
They're taking Sabine somewhere.

33:31.136 --> 33:32.596
Taraud isn't with them.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.057
<i>No, forget about Sabine.</i>

33:35.641 --> 33:37.851
What does that mean? I just let her die?

33:37.851 --> 33:40.479
No. Listen. Listen.
Guess who just showed up.

33:42.648 --> 33:43.941
Who?

33:43.941 --> 33:45.234
<i>Alison.</i>

33:45.817 --> 33:46.902
Stop messing around.

33:46.902 --> 33:50.197
<i>We're 100% sure.
She's the one ratting us out to Antropa.</i>

33:50.197 --> 33:53.408
<i>She just screwed you over again,
like always.</i>

34:04.086 --> 34:05.504
What is she doing here?

34:07.589 --> 34:09.757
Don't move.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.806
What are you doing here?

34:26.733 --> 34:28.610
No, nothing. I've lost contact with him.

35:33.217 --> 35:34.384
Who do you work for?

35:34.968 --> 35:36.220
Nobody.

35:40.641 --> 35:42.059
Answer me, fucker.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.062
How did you get in here?

35:52.444 --> 35:53.904
Okay. We're in.

35:56.448 --> 35:59.284
I want to see Mr. Taraud. Now.

35:59.826 --> 36:01.036
I'll walk you back.

36:01.036 --> 36:04.623
Mr. Hamza, your wife and son
are waiting for you downstairs.

36:14.550 --> 36:16.176
Okay, thank you.

36:17.928 --> 36:19.179
It worked.

36:22.057 --> 36:23.267
Bravo, Didier.

36:24.393 --> 36:25.853
Nice work.

36:30.357 --> 36:31.567
And Sabine?

36:40.075 --> 36:42.077
She decided to return to Brussels alone.

36:58.093 --> 36:59.720
Where are we going?

37:01.889 --> 37:03.432
Where they can kill us.

37:12.482 --> 37:13.817
Myriam. Myriam.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.403
Samir.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.408
Are you okay?

37:24.786 --> 37:26.663
- Did they do anything to you?
- No.

37:31.585 --> 37:34.046
Hicham, my son.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.194
- Escape, my love.
- No.

37:57.194 --> 37:58.820
- Are you listening to me?
- No.

38:02.658 --> 38:04.576
- Samir.
- Go, Myriam!

38:20.801 --> 38:22.553
Run, Myriam!

38:25.514 --> 38:27.933
Hey, you bastard! Don't move!

38:31.645 --> 38:32.980
Stop right there!

38:41.530 --> 38:42.906
Everyone on the ground!

38:50.789 --> 38:52.416
Come on, follow me!

38:52.416 --> 38:54.251
- Help!
- Move!

39:38.962 --> 39:40.547
What am I doing here?

39:44.051 --> 39:46.345
We're taking you on a trip, Ms. Rowdy.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.473
Where?

39:51.016 --> 39:52.434
Why?

39:52.434 --> 39:53.685
Well,

39:54.311 --> 39:56.772
you're now Antropa's mole
in the UK government.

39:58.106 --> 39:59.608
Nobody will believe that.

39:59.608 --> 40:02.486
The police have proof of your betrayal.

40:03.070 --> 40:06.949
And more will be found
after you disappear.

40:07.950 --> 40:09.117
Charges will be pressed,

40:09.117 --> 40:11.703
an international warrant put out
for your arrest,

40:12.579 --> 40:14.665
but you will never be found.

40:15.541 --> 40:18.001
Everyone will think
you've changed your identity

40:18.001 --> 40:19.294
and, eventually,

40:20.963 --> 40:23.298
you will just be forgotten.

40:25.759 --> 40:28.262
Get in there. Come on.

40:34.059 --> 40:35.561
There's a problem.

40:37.145 --> 40:39.147
There's a problem downstairs. I'll go see.

40:48.323 --> 40:49.950
I heard that you were French?

40:52.035 --> 40:53.453
Depends.

41:11.638 --> 41:13.724
You came to rescue Samir?

41:16.310 --> 41:17.603
Samir?

41:22.566 --> 41:24.651
Call your boss. I need to speak with him.

41:41.335 --> 41:44.087
Don't move. Anyone moves, I'll kill him.

41:44.087 --> 41:45.255
Calm down.

41:49.176 --> 41:50.677
We can talk this out.

42:30.092 --> 42:32.010
Still no response. It's not normal.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.095
Okay.

42:33.929 --> 42:36.932
I'll warn the British
that Delage is there. They won't be happy.

42:38.308 --> 42:40.143
Reports of gunfire over at Antropa.

42:40.143 --> 42:41.436
We're moving in.

42:56.201 --> 42:57.369
Gabriel.

43:00.289 --> 43:01.498
Gabriel.

43:09.715 --> 43:10.716
No, no, no...

43:18.390 --> 43:20.934
Help me get out of these.
Press hard on my thumb.

43:21.560 --> 43:24.354
Press on it. As hard as you can. Hurry up.

43:25.480 --> 43:26.523
Go ahead.

43:32.362 --> 43:35.741
Pull. Come on. Harder.

43:35.741 --> 43:36.867
Pull.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.787
Thanks.

43:51.673 --> 43:52.674
Gabriel.

44:02.768 --> 44:04.853
- You hold him.
- Okay.

44:13.195 --> 44:14.321
My dear.

44:22.913 --> 44:24.122
Here.

44:39.304 --> 44:41.139
Come on. We cannot lose them.

44:51.608 --> 44:53.944
- Come on, come on!
- That way.

44:53.944 --> 44:56.280
Yeah, check that room on the right.

45:01.076 --> 45:02.536
Please-- Please don't shoot.

45:02.536 --> 45:05.289
I have kids. Please.

45:38.739 --> 45:39.990
Please.

45:40.824 --> 45:42.826
Take care of him until we get help.

46:27.538 --> 46:28.830
He's coming.

46:54.189 --> 46:55.399
What?

47:02.155 --> 47:04.575
- Open the door and run.
- No.

47:05.284 --> 47:06.326
Leave!

47:06.952 --> 47:09.079
Come. You're coming too.

47:11.039 --> 47:12.791
Come. Come.

47:31.476 --> 47:32.936
Leave, Gabriel.

47:35.480 --> 47:36.565
Gabriel.

47:39.526 --> 47:42.529
Gabriel! Gabriel!

47:44.072 --> 47:45.282
Gabriel!

47:49.661 --> 47:51.330
Gabriel!

47:53.415 --> 47:54.541
Gabriel!

48:49.680 --> 48:51.807
Ronald, where the fuck are you?

48:51.807 --> 48:53.308
Richard, it's Alison.

48:54.059 --> 48:55.686
- Who?
- Alison.

48:57.437 --> 49:00.232
<i>Can you hear me? Can you hear me?</i>

49:00.232 --> 49:01.441
Alison?

49:01.441 --> 49:05.445
I'm by the river outside Antropa.
They're getting away.

49:07.072 --> 49:08.407
Okay, Alison...

49:10.367 --> 49:14.997
We have to switch to the encrypted line.
Press the hash key, Alison.

49:34.683 --> 49:37.811
Now get rid of the phone, Alison.

49:42.733 --> 49:45.277
- Alison.
- Right, move it! Move back!

49:47.613 --> 49:48.614
<i>Get rid--</i>

49:53.827 --> 49:55.329
Come on! Go, go!

50:08.425 --> 50:12.638
- This way, please. This way.
- Public area is secure...

50:13.680 --> 50:16.141
Turn around.

50:16.141 --> 50:17.434
Can we go that way?

50:17.434 --> 50:20.187
Ms. Rowdy,
the minister would like to see you.

50:21.104 --> 50:22.231
This way.

50:23.065 --> 50:25.609
Out of the way, please. Step back.

50:26.652 --> 50:27.778
Ms. Rowdy.

50:58.308 --> 50:59.726
You okay?

51:04.231 --> 51:06.024
I had to do it, Alison.

51:07.776 --> 51:09.194
I had to.

51:10.863 --> 51:12.072
Why?

51:13.907 --> 51:15.534
Did they not pay you enough?

51:17.369 --> 51:20.205
If it was about money,
they'd still be alive.

51:22.958 --> 51:27.880
I will work with anyone who best serves
the interests of this country,

51:27.880 --> 51:30.632
and I will eliminate them when they don't.

51:31.133 --> 51:32.384
It's pretty simple.

51:34.845 --> 51:37.514
History of the British fucking Empire, really.

51:40.809 --> 51:42.436
And how did that go?

51:50.152 --> 51:51.987
They always underestimate you.

51:53.697 --> 51:55.157
And you don't?

51:55.157 --> 51:56.700
No. Never.

51:58.285 --> 51:59.828
I've seen the video.

52:08.295 --> 52:09.505
Would you join me?

52:18.847 --> 52:20.724
Will you have me killed if I don't?

52:22.392 --> 52:23.810
No.

52:47.209 --> 52:49.628
Here you are. Yeah, she's fine.

52:50.379 --> 52:53.173
Come on. Okay.
You're gonna be all right, okay? You are.

53:10.566 --> 53:14.027
- Taping off the area now.
- Stretcher over here, please.

53:17.990 --> 53:22.578
You need to mind way, please.
Stretcher coming through. Thank you.

53:51.982 --> 53:53.400
You again?
