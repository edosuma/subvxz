00:14.167 --> 00:15.367
You still here?

00:16.400 --> 00:17.500
Morning!

00:17.533 --> 00:20.103
Blueberry and banana pancakes...

00:20.133 --> 00:21.533
Secret recipe.

00:21.567 --> 00:23.167
A coffee would have done.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.030
You can't just have coffee
on Holi.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.727
It's a festival, a time of joy,

00:26.767 --> 00:29.627
for friends, family...
loved ones.

00:29.667 --> 00:32.327
The only thing Holi is a time
for is abject bloody chaos.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.567
- So we're not having breakfast?
- No time. Sorry.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.370
- You can make time.
- And why would I do that?

00:38.500 --> 00:39.800
I just thought it would be nice

00:39.833 --> 00:43.033
to have some quality
one-on-one time.

00:43.067 --> 00:44.627
You and me. Us.

00:44.667 --> 00:47.427
We spent the night together.
What more do you want?

00:47.467 --> 00:50.767
Don't you think it would
be nice to actually...

00:50.800 --> 00:53.030
talk sometime?

00:53.067 --> 00:55.067
Talk? What on earth
would we talk about?

00:56.067 --> 00:57.527
I dunno.

00:57.567 --> 00:59.167
Life, death.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.303
I just don't get the rush.

01:02.333 --> 01:04.803
The hospital's not gonna
fall down without you.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.403
Yes, it will, actually.

01:06.433 --> 01:09.703
Because some of us have real
jobs with real responsibilities.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.400
Not again.

01:50.867 --> 01:52.727
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:52.767 --> 01:56.197
Today is, of course,
the Festival of Holi.

01:56.233 --> 01:58.803
The day when the entire
adult population of this state

01:58.833 --> 02:00.773
behave like children
for 24 hours.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.300
What to expect?
Everything -

02:03.333 --> 02:05.833
fractures, burns,
breaks, poisonings.

02:05.867 --> 02:08.067
You won't have heard of bhang,
Dr Walker.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.229
You have a treat in store.

02:09.267 --> 02:11.727
It's made from cannabis leaves.
They mix it into drinks.

02:11.767 --> 02:13.667
Then come to us to
have their stomachs pumped.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.130
Expect a lot of that.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.727
There's always
some bunch of idiots

02:16.767 --> 02:18.367
who fall off
a float somewhere

02:18.400 --> 02:20.300
and they all arrive
at the same time.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.403
- Any questions?
- Yes. Who's that?

02:22.433 --> 02:24.133
That is a good question.

02:24.167 --> 02:26.567
No idea. I found him
on my doorstep this morning.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.570
Someone just abandoned him?

02:28.600 --> 02:32.030
It does happen, Dr Walker,
in India and in England.

02:32.067 --> 02:34.597
I've notified the bovines
in the police department

02:34.633 --> 02:38.133
but, given the festival, I doubt
they'll be here any time soon.

02:38.167 --> 02:41.027
- Poor thing.
- Thank you for offering.

02:41.067 --> 02:42.767
But be careful.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.830
A weakness for babies has set
women's emancipation back

02:45.867 --> 02:47.727
at least 100 years.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.697
There you go.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.433
You're a natural, Dr Walker.

02:56.467 --> 02:58.727
Check him over
before the rush really starts.

02:58.767 --> 03:01.497
A foundling is the least of our
worries today, believe me.

03:01.533 --> 03:03.733
Now, where's AJ?

03:03.767 --> 03:06.167
Er...
He must be held up in traffic.

03:08.533 --> 03:10.333
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.197
Will you come visit me?

03:14.233 --> 03:16.803
You know what,
I would love nothing more.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.473
But I cannot.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.170
An Indian doctor
has many responsibilities.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.630
My patients rely on me.

03:22.667 --> 03:25.397
But not even for a holiday?

03:25.433 --> 03:27.703
Holidays are for amateurs.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.573
My work is my life.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.830
Do you think we'll ever
see each other again?

03:31.867 --> 03:34.197
My British butterfly...

03:34.233 --> 03:37.203
if it's meant to be,
the gods will take care of it.

03:39.367 --> 03:42.127
This has truly been
the best week of my life.

03:42.167 --> 03:46.227
- Mine too! Definitely.
- Come on, Josie.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.197
Let's hope that the gods
are listening.

03:49.233 --> 03:52.573
Goodbye, my British butterfly.
I will miss you!

03:52.600 --> 03:54.400
I will never forget you!

04:15.600 --> 04:17.700
Hey, not so fast.

04:17.733 --> 04:20.503
OK, well, girls,
I've got to go this way.

04:20.533 --> 04:22.473
- All the best. Take care.
- Bye.

04:30.667 --> 04:32.267
Er...excuse me.
Excuse me, guys.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.700
Hey. Hey.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.173
Hello? Can you hear me?
Are you OK?

04:36.200 --> 04:38.130
Did anybody see what happened?

04:43.267 --> 04:44.567
Well?

04:44.600 --> 04:46.530
Normal.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.627
So, how are you feeling?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.467
Never better, Dr Varma.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.730
I think India agrees with me.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.097
Well, I'm glad.

04:58.133 --> 05:00.233
But your condition
remains serious.

05:00.267 --> 05:03.767
Ssh. Not today.
It's Holi.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.370
Yes, I am aware of that.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.830
It can be quite...intense.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.527
Especially for a first-timer.

05:10.567 --> 05:11.667
Good.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.570
My mind is waiting to be blown.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.070
I may even try
some of this concoction

05:16.100 --> 05:17.770
everyone's talking about.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.170
Bhang?

05:20.200 --> 05:22.500
May as well go out with one?

05:22.533 --> 05:24.403
Excuse me. Hey...

05:24.433 --> 05:27.473
- I need some help here.
- One moment, please.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.200
Doctor! Doctor!

05:33.233 --> 05:34.603
- Hi.
- Excuse me!

05:34.633 --> 05:36.303
Please don't manhandle my staff.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.403
I'm sorry.
I just need someone to help me.

05:38.433 --> 05:40.303
You look fine.
Take a ticket and sit down.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.403
You don't understand.
I'm fine. It's my father.

05:42.433 --> 05:45.473
I think there's something wrong.
His name's Desmond Macintosh.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.500
He's around 60.

05:47.533 --> 05:48.633
Sunshine?

05:50.100 --> 05:52.100
You're Sunshine?

05:52.133 --> 05:54.133
I used to know his father
really well.

05:54.167 --> 05:55.497
Haven't seen him for years.

05:55.533 --> 05:57.273
You OK to hold the fort here?

05:57.300 --> 05:59.470
Of course.
I'm used to holding the baby.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.370
Confidence.
That's what I like to see.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.800
Never underestimate
your own abilities.

06:03.833 --> 06:05.733
One hour, no more.

06:05.767 --> 06:09.267
Make sure I have a functioning
hospital to return to, please.

06:35.067 --> 06:36.427
I can't believe you remember me.

06:36.467 --> 06:39.267
How can I forget the day
I met Sunshine Macintosh?

06:39.300 --> 06:40.470
I'd only been here a few weeks.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.500
You were burning up with a
fever, screaming blue murder.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.333
Your mother was sobbing

06:45.367 --> 06:48.027
and your father was chanting
some kind of Tibetan mantra

06:48.067 --> 06:49.197
into my right ear.

06:49.233 --> 06:51.233
And these days
people call me Sunny.

06:51.267 --> 06:55.427
OK, Sunny, so what are
you up to these days?

06:55.467 --> 06:58.327
I run a data processing
department in Reading.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.397
Actually, there
they call me Mr Macintosh.

07:00.433 --> 07:02.373
And what does
Desmond think about that?

07:02.400 --> 07:04.670
I've no idea. I haven't
seen him for ten years.

07:15.833 --> 07:18.633
Found her collapsed in the
street. Possible head injury.

07:18.667 --> 07:20.567
- Do we know her name?
- Nobody was with her.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.370
I don't recognise her.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.400
Hello, can you hear me?
What's your name?

07:26.433 --> 07:27.633
OK, she's not responding.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.597
Let's get a nasal airway in her,
please.

07:29.633 --> 07:32.103
Yes, I agree, looks like
a probable head injury.

07:32.133 --> 07:34.503
- Probably slipped and fallen.
- I don't think so.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.530
She's bleeding.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.500
You see, placenta fragments
have been retained.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.103
Which means the womb
can't contract.

07:48.133 --> 07:50.533
Which explains the bleeding
and the shock.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.027
Maybe we've found
our missing mother.

07:53.067 --> 07:54.597
Treatment?

07:54.633 --> 07:56.333
Resuscitate,
therapeutic D&C?

07:56.367 --> 07:59.197
Good.
You think you can handle that?

07:59.233 --> 08:01.573
- I'm not a gynaecologist.
- I know that.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.730
But you're here to learn,
aren't you?

08:03.767 --> 08:05.667
- Yeah, but...
- So learn.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.130
OK.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.170
Ready?

08:14.200 --> 08:16.830
You start with
the smallest dilator first.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.797
Then you move on up. OK?

08:25.167 --> 08:27.097
What are you waiting for?

08:31.700 --> 08:35.400
A few days ago I get this letter
asking me to come out here.

08:35.433 --> 08:38.633
No reason. Only that it's
a matter of life and death.

08:38.667 --> 08:42.467
So I fly half way across the
world and he won't let me in.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.370
It doesn't make sense.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.770
And you think he's unwell?

08:45.800 --> 08:47.570
Or deaf.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.430
Listen.

08:51.133 --> 08:54.203
- He's singing.
- He's wailing.

09:00.267 --> 09:03.627
Desmond? Desmond Macintosh.
It's Lydia Fonseca.

09:03.667 --> 09:06.467
Dad? Dad! Desmond!

09:08.600 --> 09:12.500
- See?
- In situations like these,

09:12.533 --> 09:17.073
I think it's essential to try
and think like one's opponent.

10:21.467 --> 10:23.097
Sunshine!

10:25.667 --> 10:27.697
Come here. Come here.
Come here.

10:29.467 --> 10:31.397
You're home!

10:32.700 --> 10:34.700
My boy...

10:34.733 --> 10:36.303
My boy.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.430
Aw...

10:54.133 --> 10:56.203
You don't get this
in Stourbridge?

11:03.833 --> 11:05.673
Come on.

11:23.633 --> 11:24.803
Thank you.

11:24.833 --> 11:27.373
There you go. Come on.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.330
Look, come here.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.370
Can I have two, please?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.800
You don't even know
what that is.

11:32.833 --> 11:36.233
It's traditional.
Something called bhang. Look.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.727
Smells like disinfectant.
What's in it?

11:39.767 --> 11:42.327
Better not to smell, sir.

11:42.367 --> 11:44.297
Just drink.

11:45.333 --> 11:47.533
Come on! One...two...

11:47.567 --> 11:49.667
If I go blind,
I'll come looking for you.

11:49.700 --> 11:51.130
..three!

12:06.667 --> 12:08.567
Pay the man.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.530
There you go, mate.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.670
Thank you.
That was strong.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.700
You should
put some clothes on.

12:34.733 --> 12:37.103
Never! I always work naked.

12:37.133 --> 12:39.473
Peels back the barriers
to perception.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.430
How long have you had
that cough?

12:45.333 --> 12:47.373
May 11th, 1981.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.370
It started the day
Bob Marley died.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.730
You're severely congested,
probably pneumonia.

12:51.767 --> 12:54.297
Desmond, you should have
called me.

12:54.333 --> 12:56.203
Sorry.
Quacks don't agree with me.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.733
I can't believe
you live like this.

12:57.767 --> 13:00.527
Priorities, Sunshine, dear boy!

13:00.567 --> 13:02.697
Art comes first. Life later.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.373
What the hell was that?

13:04.400 --> 13:06.170
Rat! God, there's a rat!

13:06.200 --> 13:08.200
That's not a rat.
It's Jimi Hendrix!

13:19.567 --> 13:22.527
Hey, I'm Dr Walker.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.573
What's your name?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.270
Shobha...

13:28.300 --> 13:31.430
- Where am I?
- You're in the hospital.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.097
You collapsed.

13:33.133 --> 13:35.073
You had to have a procedure.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.170
But it's OK. Really.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.130
You're going to be fine.

13:41.467 --> 13:43.397
Where's your baby?

13:45.467 --> 13:46.697
What baby?

13:47.700 --> 13:50.400
We know you gave birth recently.

13:50.433 --> 13:52.233
It's why you collapsed.

13:52.267 --> 13:55.527
Your body hadn't discharged
the placenta.

13:55.567 --> 13:59.367
I don't know what you're talking
about. I don't have a baby.

14:01.433 --> 14:04.833
I'm not going to
a bloody hospital!

14:04.867 --> 14:06.467
You need an X-ray.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.370
Probably
intravenous antibiotics.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.770
Plus this place is disgusting -
it's a health hazard.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.530
Sunny's right.
You can't stay here.

14:12.567 --> 14:14.727
I'm going nowhere.
This is exactly what happens

14:14.767 --> 14:16.097
when doctors get involved!

14:16.133 --> 14:18.103
Why the hell did you bring
her here anyway?

14:18.133 --> 14:20.073
The same reason I jumped
on a bloody plane.

14:20.100 --> 14:23.330
The letter you sent...
I was worried about you.

14:23.367 --> 14:24.797
God alone knows why.

14:32.867 --> 14:35.467
I don't know what's wrong
with him. He's changed.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.200
Should've seen him as a baby.

14:37.233 --> 14:39.203
So calm. Like a little Buddha.

14:39.233 --> 14:40.803
He's simply concerned about you.

14:40.833 --> 14:43.433
That chest needs treatment
or it'll get worse.

14:43.467 --> 14:46.327
So treat me here,
if you're so worried about it.

14:46.367 --> 14:49.667
Hospitals are for sick people.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.370
I would, but Jimi doesn't
sound too well either.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.400
- Jimi?
- That cough could be pneumonia.

14:57.433 --> 14:59.273
Which is pretty serious
in simians.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.770
Can kill them...like that.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.330
Or monkey pox.

15:03.367 --> 15:05.027
Or worse.

15:05.067 --> 15:06.767
Of course,
if we got him to hospital,

15:06.800 --> 15:10.370
we could confirm that diagnosis
and maybe save his life.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.697
But you probably
don't like that idea.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.330
Shobha is clearly the mother
of the baby

15:20.367 --> 15:22.097
but refuses to admit anything.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.773
Do you blame her? Abandoning
a baby is a criminal offence.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.670
No, it's not that.
She's terrified.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.200
- She needs help.
- She should have asked for it

15:30.233 --> 15:31.833
before she put her child
at risk.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.567
You need to inform
the authorities.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.630
Everything is black and white
with you.

15:35.667 --> 15:38.427
- She knows she's in trouble.
- I'm glad she understands

15:38.467 --> 15:39.567
how serious this is.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.400
She's virtually a child herself.

15:41.433 --> 15:43.203
She needs help,
someone she can trust.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.033
If you can't see that, you're
blind as well as arrogant.

15:50.433 --> 15:54.233
Dr Walker! Dr Varma!
Here... Now!

15:54.267 --> 15:56.597
And what can I do for you?

16:13.567 --> 16:16.267
So the powder must have
worsened your asthma. OK?

16:16.300 --> 16:17.470
No more today. OK?

16:17.500 --> 16:19.500
No! No!

16:19.533 --> 16:20.673
No!

16:29.667 --> 16:31.467
Come, come.
Breathe, breathe.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.370
Come with me.
Come, come, come.

16:43.267 --> 16:45.727
- It's not funny.
- Of course not.

16:55.533 --> 16:58.103
Mari.

16:58.133 --> 17:01.403
As predicted,
abject bloody chaos.

17:01.433 --> 17:03.503
Excuse me.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.403
Highly congested...

17:05.433 --> 17:07.373
It's Holi, Jimi.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.599
My favourite festival
of the year...

17:11.666 --> 17:13.567
..and I forgot.

17:13.599 --> 17:14.800
You've been sick.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.772
You don't understand, Sunshine.

17:18.666 --> 17:21.097
It's like Santa Claus
forgetting Christmas.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.369
I didn't remember.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.730
I've never missed Holi
in 20 years.

17:27.767 --> 17:29.667
Excuse me, this way, please.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.473
We've found the mother.
Well, at least I think we have.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.730
I just wanted somewhere
quiet for the baby till...

17:48.767 --> 17:50.767
And the police,
they've been informed?

17:50.800 --> 17:53.230
I wanted to talk about that.
In the circumstances...

17:53.267 --> 17:55.467
Abandoning a baby is a crime,
Dr Walker.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.270
Whatever the situation, the
authorities must be informed.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.830
- I don't think we should rush.
- And in England,

18:00.867 --> 18:03.597
a girl like this would be a
personal crusade, would she?

18:03.633 --> 18:06.233
Or would you be required
to inform social services

18:06.267 --> 18:08.267
whatever the circumstances?

18:08.300 --> 18:10.070
I thought so.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.700
I need to change.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.327
Fine. I'll call them.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.197
Haven't you
forgotten something?

18:33.067 --> 18:35.767
AJ! AJ!

18:37.267 --> 18:39.267
I think someone's
looking for you.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.570
AJ?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.630
Josie?

18:51.400 --> 18:54.630
Wow.
Was your flight delayed?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.497
So you'll get
the next flight out?

18:56.533 --> 18:59.033
I'm staying,
my handsome gorgeous doctor!

19:07.767 --> 19:10.167
She has to go home!

19:10.200 --> 19:12.330
Doesn't look like she's
going anywhere, mate.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.767
What the hell
did you say to her?

19:13.800 --> 19:16.330
Nothing! I simply told her
what I tell all of them.

19:16.367 --> 19:18.727
- Which is?
- That, you know,

19:18.767 --> 19:21.097
if it's meant to be,
the gods will take care of it.

19:21.133 --> 19:24.233
The gods usually make sure
they get back on the plane.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.067
This is such a disaster.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.730
Thanks.

19:29.767 --> 19:33.667
OK. So let's go snorkelling
at the weekend.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.330
Or get a boat to one of the
islands and have a picnic!

19:37.367 --> 19:39.267
That would be romantic,
wouldn't it?

19:39.300 --> 19:41.530
- You and me...dolphins!
- Yeah.

19:41.567 --> 19:43.767
Obviously I'm dying to
see your penthouse first.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.170
Er...no.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.530
- I have to go.
- Now?

19:49.567 --> 19:52.397
It's the hospital.
They just texted.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.173
I mean, I have it on vibrate.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.700
There's an emergency. So...

19:55.733 --> 19:57.473
When will you be back?

19:57.500 --> 19:59.430
As soon as I can.
Promise!

20:03.800 --> 20:05.730
See you later, Dr Nair!

20:07.300 --> 20:09.230
Yeah, later, doc.

20:12.367 --> 20:13.567
There you are!

20:13.600 --> 20:17.100
In your absence, I've been
holding the fort almost...

20:18.367 --> 20:20.297
Are we a veterinary practice
now?

20:20.333 --> 20:22.703
- I thought you hated monkeys.
- I do.

20:22.733 --> 20:26.003
But out of the two, the monkey
is the easiest to deal with.

20:28.867 --> 20:30.827
Lobar pneumonia.

20:30.867 --> 20:32.527
Looks nasty.

20:32.567 --> 20:34.027
Someone from the festival?

20:34.067 --> 20:36.067
No. Desmond Macintosh.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.300
The artist?

20:38.333 --> 20:40.233
- Is he still alive?
- Just.

20:40.267 --> 20:42.397
Although he's trying his best
to change that.

20:42.433 --> 20:44.133
He's here, but he
wants to go home.

20:44.167 --> 20:45.827
Home? With a chest like that?

20:45.867 --> 20:47.797
- Is he mad?
- Very possibly.

21:02.733 --> 21:03.733
Hi.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.773
Do you wanna hold him?

21:10.667 --> 21:11.727
It's easy.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.430
Let me help you.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.403
Come on.

21:23.400 --> 21:24.700
Shobha!

21:28.833 --> 21:31.233
Shobha? Shobha, come back!

21:32.367 --> 21:35.127
Shobha? Excuse me.
Shobha?

22:20.367 --> 22:22.797
Shobha, you need to
come back to the hospital.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.300
I'm not going there.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.473
You're going to call the police.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.530
No, we're not. I promise.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.430
I saw the way you looked at me.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.397
You think
I'm a terrible person...

22:42.267 --> 22:43.667
You're my patient.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.700
All I care about
is getting you well.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.673
Nobody's talking to the police.

22:50.633 --> 22:52.103
You have my word.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.670
Where's Dr Walker's patient?
This is her bed.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.570
She's post op,
the uterine bleed.

22:58.600 --> 23:00.730
OK, if you can't find her,

23:00.767 --> 23:03.567
call the police and make sure
they understand the situation.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.770
She's probably scared
and vulnerable.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.073
And find Dr Walker!

23:10.100 --> 23:11.530
OK, sorry to keep you.

23:11.567 --> 23:13.067
Right, as suspected,

23:13.100 --> 23:15.630
both you and Jimi Hendrix
have severe pneumonia.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.667
You'll need to stay a while
for monitoring.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.300
This is ridiculous!

23:19.333 --> 23:21.303
Dr Fonseca only
wants to help you.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.033
You won't be here for long.

23:23.067 --> 23:24.567
- Right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.830
It's just a temporary measure.
We have your antibiotics.

23:27.867 --> 23:29.467
Red for you. Yellow for Jimi.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.600
- Don't mix them up, OK?
- I'm not an idiot!

23:32.633 --> 23:36.033
Exactly how long do I have
to stay in this hell hole?

23:36.067 --> 23:37.567
I'll review you in a while.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.270
If you behave yourself,
we'll talk.

23:40.300 --> 23:43.500
Maybe you can
settle something for me.

23:43.533 --> 23:45.333
Dr Nair and I were just arguing.

23:45.367 --> 23:49.527
The Rolling Stones -
who was in the original line-up?

23:49.567 --> 23:52.027
Jagger, Richards, Wyman, Watts.

23:52.067 --> 23:54.027
And poor old Brian, of course.

23:54.067 --> 23:56.497
- Not Taylor?
- Joined in '69.

23:56.533 --> 23:59.233
- First played on Let It Bleed.
- Damn. I lose.

23:59.267 --> 24:01.797
Now remind me about those pills.
Which ones are yours?

24:03.667 --> 24:05.597
What pills?

24:14.133 --> 24:15.633
Have you finished with that?

24:15.667 --> 24:18.067
You think I should
go to the hospital?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.600
You know, surprise him?

24:19.633 --> 24:21.203
Or is that a bit stupid?

24:21.233 --> 24:25.673
Stupid? Are you crazy?

24:25.700 --> 24:29.430
Dr Nair loves surprises more
than my mum loves cake.

24:29.467 --> 24:31.097
- Really?
- Go.

24:31.133 --> 24:33.173
Go surprise him.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.130
What are you waiting for?

24:43.167 --> 24:45.367
Dementia?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.270
You're displaying
all the signs -

24:47.300 --> 24:49.670
short-term memory loss,
erratic behaviour.

24:49.700 --> 24:52.370
Then there's the weight loss.
When did you last eat?

24:52.400 --> 24:54.100
I eat when I'm hungry.

24:54.133 --> 24:57.073
I don't think you remember
to eat at all.

24:57.100 --> 24:59.170
This is ridiculous!

24:59.200 --> 25:01.830
If you poke and prod around,

25:01.867 --> 25:05.227
of course you're gonna find some
trouble in a man of my age.

25:05.267 --> 25:08.797
I'm just a little
under the weather, that's all.

25:08.833 --> 25:11.103
What about Sunny, then?
Why is he here?

25:13.500 --> 25:15.430
Dunno. Ask him.

25:18.367 --> 25:20.067
You wrote to me.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.200
You asked me
to come and see you.

25:24.267 --> 25:26.197
Nonsense.

25:27.533 --> 25:29.473
Then what's this?

26:21.500 --> 26:23.430
You said you wouldn't call them.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.130
Shobha Pereira...

26:35.067 --> 26:36.727
I gave her my word.

26:36.767 --> 26:39.027
You should have started
correct procedures.

26:39.067 --> 26:40.797
I told you to remain objective.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.833
That's not fair. I was trying to
make sure...

26:42.867 --> 26:45.827
If fairness came into it,
there'd be a cure for cellulite.

26:45.867 --> 26:47.397
I said to call the authorities.

26:47.433 --> 26:49.303
But clearly
Dr Walker preferred to

26:49.333 --> 26:50.833
take matters into her own hands.

26:50.867 --> 26:53.367
The fact remains we had a
vulnerable patient on our hands

26:53.400 --> 26:55.600
and we should all have been
watching her.

26:57.667 --> 26:59.667
So are you gonna
sort this mess out

26:59.700 --> 27:01.630
or will it, as usual,
fall to me?

27:04.067 --> 27:05.327
I'll call the parents.

27:19.833 --> 27:22.203
Hi, there.

27:22.233 --> 27:25.173
I'm here to see Dr Nair.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.400
He's busy.
You'll have to wait your turn.

27:40.733 --> 27:42.673
Buggeration.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.430
Surprise, Dr Nair.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.333
Urh!

28:00.400 --> 28:02.430
So, how long...

28:02.467 --> 28:04.327
before I go completely gaga?

28:05.700 --> 28:07.170
Impossible to say.

28:09.433 --> 28:12.173
I'm curious.
Why did you write to him?

28:14.333 --> 28:16.233
I just wanted to spend
some time with my boy.

28:16.267 --> 28:18.127
But why now,
after all these years?

28:18.167 --> 28:20.097
I don't know.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.533
He owes me nothing.

28:23.567 --> 28:25.567
He's still your son.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.470
Is he?

28:27.500 --> 28:29.800
Now I look him in the eye,
I'm not so sure.

28:29.833 --> 28:33.403
Talk to Sunny.
Tell him how you feel.

28:33.433 --> 28:35.203
Whilst I still remember
his name?

28:35.233 --> 28:37.303
Which is Sunshine, by the way.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.203
Always was.

28:39.233 --> 28:42.003
Just...Sunshine.

28:47.233 --> 28:50.233
Shobha's made a good recovery.
And the baby's great, healthy.

28:50.267 --> 28:51.367
I cannot believe it.

28:51.400 --> 28:54.270
How could she have hidden
this from us for so long?

29:09.133 --> 29:11.133
Everything is going to be
all right.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500
I never knew
you could dance like this.

29:34.533 --> 29:36.133
Me neither.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.230
Whoo.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.730
I feel a bit stoned.

29:47.267 --> 29:49.827
Stoned? No!

29:49.867 --> 29:51.797
I smoked a bit of weed
back in the day.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.173
I remember.

29:53.200 --> 29:57.400
Paul Smart, you bad boy!

29:58.767 --> 30:01.297
Come on!

30:18.867 --> 30:21.727
Hey.
Are you all right?

30:21.767 --> 30:24.227
Is it too much?
Should we go?

30:24.267 --> 30:26.527
No.

30:26.567 --> 30:28.567
It's amazing.

30:28.600 --> 30:30.700
I'm having the most
amazing time.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.730
What is it, then?

30:37.200 --> 30:39.130
I don't want it to end.

30:42.567 --> 30:44.497
I don't want to die, Paul.

30:47.633 --> 30:49.573
I don't want to die.

31:16.467 --> 31:19.527
The police understand
that Shobha panicked

31:19.567 --> 31:21.427
and made a mistake.
She's just a child.

31:21.467 --> 31:24.367
She can't be held
responsible for her actions.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.070
They can put the formal
adoption procedures in place.

31:28.100 --> 31:30.670
And you're sure that's
what Shobha wants?

31:30.700 --> 31:32.230
It is what is right.

31:32.267 --> 31:34.327
My daughter is
an excellent student.

31:34.367 --> 31:36.227
She has a bright future ahead.

31:36.267 --> 31:38.567
Must put all this
unpleasantness behind.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.100
I want to thank you again
for everything you have done.

31:49.433 --> 31:51.033
Thanks.

31:53.367 --> 31:55.227
- I'm sorry. You OK?
- Yeah. Just missed me.

31:55.267 --> 31:56.797
My fault.
Let me get you another.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.103
Erm...two teas, please.

31:59.133 --> 32:00.803
- Two teas?
- Yeah.

32:04.767 --> 32:06.327
How's your dad?

32:06.367 --> 32:09.367
Erm...it turns out
he's losing his mind.

32:09.400 --> 32:12.470
Although quite how anyone
can tell is a mystery to me.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.800
Thanks.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.773
It's almost funny.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.500
I'd finally managed to
forget him and now this.

32:20.533 --> 32:22.403
What would you do?

32:22.433 --> 32:24.373
A man I hardly know expects me
to drop everything

32:24.400 --> 32:25.700
to take care of him.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.797
I never knew my dad.

32:29.833 --> 32:31.573
Maybe you have a second chance?

32:36.500 --> 32:38.030
Thanks for the tea.

33:23.567 --> 33:24.697
Well?

33:24.733 --> 33:27.033
I suppose I can
take time off work.

33:27.067 --> 33:29.567
At least until
we figure things out.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.670
I need to make some calls,
tell work I'll be away a while.

33:32.700 --> 33:34.400
Thank you.

33:34.433 --> 33:35.703
You're a good son.

33:41.367 --> 33:43.167
For what it's worth, I agree.

33:44.467 --> 33:46.367
I need a couple of hours,

33:46.400 --> 33:48.770
and then I'll be back
to collect him.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.470
Can we make sure he's ready?

33:50.500 --> 33:52.170
Yeah, yeah, of course.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.500
Thanks.

34:03.400 --> 34:06.070
I've never been
so embarrassed in all my life!

34:07.300 --> 34:09.570
Clearly I've failed as a father.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.500
I've not imposed
enough discipline,

34:11.533 --> 34:14.003
allowed you too much freedom.

34:15.333 --> 34:16.773
If your mother were here...

34:22.699 --> 34:25.730
Well, things are going to
have to change.

34:26.632 --> 34:27.803
Beginning now.

34:38.100 --> 34:42.570
I want to apologise for my son's
poor behaviour towards you.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.730
He was not raised to be
so disrespectful to women.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.333
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

35:01.467 --> 35:03.367
Where is he now?

35:03.400 --> 35:05.530
With the police.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.497
They've come to collect him.

35:09.633 --> 35:12.673
Do you think I can see him,
say goodbye?

35:14.567 --> 35:17.567
I'm sorry,
it's against the rules.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.700
But they'll take
good care of him.

35:20.733 --> 35:21.733
So did I.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.430
I'd have never left him
on a doorstep.

35:31.233 --> 35:33.033
What do you mean?

35:33.067 --> 35:35.267
My mother. My father.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.670
They took him away
in the middle of the night.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.430
They didn't even tell me.

35:43.733 --> 35:45.703
So you don't want this?

35:45.733 --> 35:48.333
If I try to keep him,
my parents will disown me.

35:54.067 --> 35:56.067
What kind of life
would he have then?

35:58.867 --> 36:02.127
I can't take care of him on my
own. I don't have any money.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.273
My parents are right.

36:10.367 --> 36:11.797
This is the only way.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.730
I'm er...

37:25.500 --> 37:27.570
I'm sorry.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.770
I should have...listened to you.

37:32.167 --> 37:34.167
Imagine how she must have felt,

37:34.200 --> 37:36.000
waking up like that
to find him gone.

37:37.867 --> 37:41.597
And then they tell her
what they've done.

37:41.633 --> 37:46.233
One minute he's there and...
and the next he's gone.

37:46.267 --> 37:48.597
Disappeared out of her life
forever.

37:50.500 --> 37:55.400
Erm...I need a drink.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.370
Let's get out of here.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.130
I- I don't want a drink.

38:00.167 --> 38:02.667
I know... I know it's supposed
to be the default setting

38:02.700 --> 38:03.900
for the English doctor

38:03.933 --> 38:08.403
but I... I really, really
don't want to just forget this.

38:10.267 --> 38:12.567
- Not today.
- We're not going to the bar.

39:35.233 --> 39:37.173
What do I do?

39:38.533 --> 39:40.473
That's up to you.

39:56.533 --> 39:58.233
How often do you
come to your temple?

39:58.267 --> 40:00.697
Only when I need to.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.673
Or someone else does.

40:05.133 --> 40:08.403
You were right. I shouldn't
have let it get to me.

40:08.433 --> 40:10.603
It's easier said than done.

40:10.633 --> 40:12.573
Plus I've had more practice.

40:21.233 --> 40:22.573
I was pregnant.

40:24.367 --> 40:27.327
Three years ago.

40:27.367 --> 40:29.727
It wasn't planned.
I had exams.

40:29.767 --> 40:33.027
And I'd worked so hard
to get there.

40:34.500 --> 40:38.300
So I just kept on working,
kept on pushing,

40:40.233 --> 40:42.233
pretending nothing
was happening.

40:45.533 --> 40:48.033
Marcus was painting
the spare room and I...

40:53.067 --> 40:55.067
I was wishing it would
all just go away.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.330
And then it did.

41:04.333 --> 41:06.273
He did.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.130
They told me it was a boy.

41:12.067 --> 41:14.127
I think they thought
it would help,

41:14.167 --> 41:16.667
you know, with the process.

41:18.467 --> 41:22.367
And everyone kept saying,
"Don't worry.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.330
You can try again."

41:27.767 --> 41:30.067
But I knew I couldn't.

41:31.367 --> 41:33.297
I didn't deserve it.

41:36.567 --> 41:39.667
Because I'd had a baby...

41:39.700 --> 41:41.630
..and I'd just wished it away.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.730
I wished him away.

42:33.233 --> 42:35.833
Sunshine's not coming back,
is he?

42:35.867 --> 42:38.327
Sorry, Desmond.
I don't think he is.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.400
Then I want to go home.

42:45.433 --> 42:47.403
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

42:47.433 --> 42:49.203
Please.

42:52.233 --> 42:54.403
Just take me home.

43:08.233 --> 43:10.503
There should be enough there
to last the week.

43:10.533 --> 43:11.833
Here's my number.

43:11.867 --> 43:14.527
You can call me any time,
day or night, OK?

43:15.600 --> 43:17.400
And those are for Jimi.

43:19.867 --> 43:24.367
Guess you pays your money
and you takes your choice?

44:17.100 --> 44:19.730
Please tell me
you've still got alcohol.

44:23.133 --> 44:24.773
Sorry, after hours.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.730
It'd be illegal for me
to sell it to you.

44:36.300 --> 44:38.430
So...

44:38.467 --> 44:43.727
to what do I owe the honour
of this late-night visit?

44:43.767 --> 44:46.327
You said you wanted
to talk, didn't you?

44:46.367 --> 44:48.467
So let's talk.

44:50.100 --> 44:52.230
Just make it interesting.
