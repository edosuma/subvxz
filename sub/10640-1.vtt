03:23.301 --> 03:25.929
- You look awful!
- I had a late-night poker game.

03:26.179 --> 03:28.473
You should have at least shaved.

03:30.725 --> 03:34.438
This new Police Commissioner Blakelock
is very spit-and-polish.

03:34.689 --> 03:35.773
Fuck him.

03:35.982 --> 03:39.318
But, Jesus God, Ben!
You got to watch the way you look.

03:39.568 --> 03:42.363
You can't walk in on these
bigwigs without shaving.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.156
You just can't do that.

03:44.573 --> 03:47.034
You should've put on a tie.

03:47.285 --> 03:48.995
You should've shined your shoes.

03:49.245 --> 03:53.082
You should've made an effort
to spruce up a little bit.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.167
Mr. Feyderspiel.

03:55.418 --> 03:56.753
Shockley. How are you?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.422
Fine, sir.

04:00.215 --> 04:02.259
How's our Assistant D.A. these days?

04:02.509 --> 04:05.220
Shit! He couldn't convict Hitler.

04:06.179 --> 04:08.015
Don't use any profanity.

04:08.265 --> 04:10.017
And remember to say "sir" to him.

04:10.267 --> 04:13.145
When he speaks to you, say "sir."
Then stand up straight.

04:13.395 --> 04:15.606
And for God's sakes,
don't breathe on him.

04:15.814 --> 04:16.648
Here.

04:16.898 --> 04:18.483
Wait a minute, guy! Come on!

04:18.735 --> 04:20.236
Open your mouth.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.156
I wish I had time to shave you.

04:23.406 --> 04:24.907
Nag, nag, nag!

04:34.834 --> 04:35.877
E.A. Blakelock.

04:36.628 --> 04:38.171
Ben Shockley, sir.

04:39.006 --> 04:40.716
I've heard about you, Shockley.

04:43.260 --> 04:45.846
As Commissioner of the
police department...

04:46.180 --> 04:48.432
...considerable responsibility.

04:49.058 --> 04:51.393
Watchdog of the department,
so to speak.

04:51.644 --> 04:53.228
Policing the police.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.815
So that the need for
absolute secrecy is...

04:57.107 --> 04:58.275
I understand.

05:02.072 --> 05:03.156
Plane tickets.

05:03.490 --> 05:05.742
Extradite and subpoena.

05:06.451 --> 05:09.704
You're flying to Las Vegas,
coming back with...

05:09.996 --> 05:11.957
...a prisoner for us...

05:12.457 --> 05:15.961
...whom you will remand
to custody at County.

05:16.836 --> 05:19.839
And then you report, you know,
back here.

05:23.302 --> 05:27.264
Respectfully, sir,
I work for Metro squad. Why me?

05:28.557 --> 05:31.852
Your division commander says
you're a man who gets the job done.

05:34.689 --> 05:37.817
Is there anything special
I should know about this case?

05:41.153 --> 05:43.030
What it is, is this:

05:43.364 --> 05:45.909
It's a nothing witness
for a nothing trial.

05:48.578 --> 05:49.913
That'll be all.

05:54.209 --> 05:57.713
You represent the Phoenix P.D.
Get a shave.

05:59.715 --> 06:00.924
Yes, sir.

06:04.636 --> 06:08.141
15 years on the bricks together,
look what happens to us.

06:08.391 --> 06:11.728
I land a lousy desk job.
You get a freebie to Vegas.

06:11.978 --> 06:14.564
Big deal. A two-bit witness
for a two-bit trial.

06:14.814 --> 06:17.775
- Anybody I know?
- Name's Gus Mally. Heard of him?

06:17.984 --> 06:19.569
No. What's the charge?

06:19.861 --> 06:21.029
He wouldn't say.

06:21.279 --> 06:22.989
I'm just going there...
Hi, Shirley.

06:23.239 --> 06:25.867
And coming back. You won't
even have time to get laid.

06:26.075 --> 06:28.329
You won't have time.
Helen'd kill me.

06:28.579 --> 06:31.540
Listen, are you still
getting serviced by Shirley?

06:31.790 --> 06:35.127
Why not? You've got a
very shapely lady there.

06:36.795 --> 06:39.256
She was after me for my money.

06:41.675 --> 06:44.136
The trip to Vegas is 2 hours.
Have dinner with us.

06:44.386 --> 06:47.222
Not tonight. Say hello to Helen
and the kids, though.

06:47.473 --> 06:51.353
And thanks for the escort.
I know how busy you execs are.

06:51.603 --> 06:53.480
In your ear, Jim!

06:53.730 --> 06:55.941
Congratulations on the promotion.

06:57.400 --> 07:02.197
I don't know why they promoted me.
We're partners, for chrissake.

07:02.447 --> 07:04.240
You deserved the promotion.

07:04.491 --> 07:06.451
I hate paperwork, you know that.

07:06.701 --> 07:10.414
If it wasn't for the family,
I'd tell them to shove it.

07:10.665 --> 07:12.500
Why don't you quit bellyaching?

07:12.792 --> 07:15.878
- You're off the bricks, aren't you?
- I like the bricks.

07:16.462 --> 07:18.881
Relax and enjoy life.

07:25.262 --> 07:27.890
You and me been through
some doors together.

07:28.140 --> 07:29.350
We've had our times.

07:31.353 --> 07:33.563
We've had our times.

08:26.327 --> 08:28.370
Ever been to Las Vegas before?

08:34.668 --> 08:36.212
A lot of tourists in town.

08:36.462 --> 08:40.008
It's always this way, the Strip,
choked with traffic all the time.

08:40.258 --> 08:44.512
You can't drive. You can't go fast.
30 miles an hour all the way.

08:45.805 --> 08:46.973
The old days...

08:47.223 --> 08:49.267
Buddy, drop the tourist crap,
will you?

09:08.287 --> 09:10.122
What do you mean my man isn't here?

09:10.373 --> 09:12.249
You heard what I said, bud.

09:12.750 --> 09:16.796
I've got papers for one Gus Mally.
The address is this building.

09:17.046 --> 09:19.006
You better check again.

09:19.257 --> 09:21.927
I've got all kinds of fellas in here.

09:22.177 --> 09:25.222
I got a Smith.
I got a Gonzales.

09:25.472 --> 09:27.432
I got a McNaughton.
Take your pick.

09:27.683 --> 09:30.936
But I don't have a fella
named Gus Mally.

09:31.645 --> 09:35.232
He was to have been picked up
yesterday, held for extradition.

09:35.941 --> 09:38.110
Somebody screwed up.

09:39.486 --> 09:40.905
Wait a minute now!

09:41.155 --> 09:43.574
When you get back to
Phoenix empty-handed...

09:43.825 --> 09:46.077
...all I said was...

09:46.411 --> 09:49.580
...I ain't got no guy named Gus Mally.

09:50.873 --> 09:54.544
Augustina Mally I got
over in women's detention.

09:57.755 --> 09:58.965
Asshole.

09:59.215 --> 10:01.467
She's been spitting up since morning.

10:01.718 --> 10:04.596
I don't know.
She might have a fever or something.

10:05.139 --> 10:08.559
We called the prison doctor,
but he hasn't shown up yet.

10:13.355 --> 10:15.399
Hit the deck, Mally.

10:17.651 --> 10:18.569
Has she eaten?

10:19.236 --> 10:21.238
Just a cup of coffee this morning.

10:26.161 --> 10:28.955
Looks like she put
cigarette ashes in the coffee.

10:29.706 --> 10:30.790
Old army trick.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.627
She wanted to look sick.

10:34.836 --> 10:37.380
Let me go!
They're going to kill me!

10:37.631 --> 10:39.633
I want a fucking lawyer!

10:43.428 --> 10:44.429
Terrific!

10:44.679 --> 10:47.767
My life on the line and they
send me an on-the-ropes bum!

10:49.727 --> 10:50.853
What kind of record?

10:51.354 --> 10:52.688
Hooker.

10:55.107 --> 10:57.109
We've got a problem, you and me.

10:57.360 --> 11:00.279
We don't like each other,
but we're taking a trip together.

11:00.529 --> 11:03.491
You can come along peacefully
or be a pain in the ass.

11:03.699 --> 11:06.827
But I warn you, mess around
and I'll put cuffs on.

11:07.037 --> 11:09.790
Talk dirty, I gag you.
If you run, I'll shoot you.

11:10.040 --> 11:12.626
My name is Shockley.
We've got a plane to catch.

11:12.876 --> 11:14.920
They're still cutting her papers.

11:16.463 --> 11:17.297
Swell.

11:17.506 --> 11:19.591
Can you ask them to hurry it up, please?

11:19.841 --> 11:21.134
You...

11:22.219 --> 11:23.470
...think about what I said.

11:24.471 --> 11:26.056
You're a dead man, Shockley.

11:26.390 --> 11:27.474
They'll kill me.

11:27.683 --> 11:29.769
And if you're with me,
they'll kill you.

11:30.186 --> 11:31.312
Who's "they"?

11:32.480 --> 11:34.107
I don't know.

11:34.399 --> 11:36.776
Why are they going to kill you?

11:37.151 --> 11:38.319
I don't know.

11:39.696 --> 11:40.947
Pack your lipstick.

11:41.197 --> 11:42.657
Damn it, it's the truth!

11:42.865 --> 11:45.702
They've even got a line on it.
On us!

11:45.952 --> 11:49.122
They got a betting line on
everything in this town.

11:49.372 --> 11:50.916
Ponies, football, the fights.

11:51.166 --> 11:54.920
Nobody cares about a dumb-ass cop
and a two-bit hooker on Airwest.

11:55.170 --> 11:56.797
Shockley, listen to me.

11:57.047 --> 12:00.718
It's 50-to-1 we don't make it.
Ask any bookie.

12:00.968 --> 12:02.886
Don't drown in the sink.

12:06.223 --> 12:07.433
You big prick!

12:18.194 --> 12:19.487
That's a hooker?

12:19.738 --> 12:23.700
The kick now is the schoolgirl look.
She's on the high side.

12:23.950 --> 12:27.078
Finds it hard to maintain
those hundred-dollar tricks.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.456
On a scale of 10, I'd give her a 2.

12:29.706 --> 12:32.459
And that's only because
I've never seen a 1 before.

12:34.670 --> 12:38.716
Okay, sir. Here you are,
just what you ordered.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.217
How about another one?

12:40.468 --> 12:41.385
This is fine.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.596
- You sure?
- I've got a plane to catch.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.891
Holy gee!
No way you'd get me on a plane.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.935
Not after the airline pilots
I've dated.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.480
I wouldn't let those
assholes drive my car.

12:53.522 --> 12:54.733
Really?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.486
Just last week
I was reading this article.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.071
It talked about flying.

12:59.321 --> 13:01.490
Said we'd all become just like cattle.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.743
Trusting our lives
to people we don't even know.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.454
Like pilots.
Said we do it all the time.

13:07.704 --> 13:10.082
Then we get our heads bashed in...

13:10.332 --> 13:12.751
...like cattle,
for being so trusting.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.878
Did you ever think about that?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.090
Like those pilots I dated.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.844
They're so snockered
they don't know what button to push.

13:22.095 --> 13:24.764
One minute you're flying
30,000 feet in the air...

13:25.014 --> 13:27.308
...next you are splattered
all over the ground...

13:27.558 --> 13:31.312
...somebody's dachshund
nipping at your pancreas.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.988
Flying really sucks,
you know what I mean?

13:41.573 --> 13:43.534
How much on what, sport?

13:43.951 --> 13:45.035
Mally No Show.

13:45.285 --> 13:46.954
What's the score on her?

13:47.204 --> 13:48.372
50-to-1.

13:49.206 --> 13:51.625
I can read.
I mean, how does she run?

13:52.293 --> 13:55.170
I don't know shit from horses.
I just put up the names.

13:56.213 --> 13:57.840
She started out at 20-to-1.

14:01.052 --> 14:03.972
The smart money must figure
she ain't got a chance.

14:05.098 --> 14:06.308
You want to bet or not?

14:08.268 --> 14:09.853
Maybe later.

14:16.526 --> 14:18.278
<i>Ed's Pony Book.</i>

14:18.528 --> 14:21.699
You got a horse in the 10th race
called Mally No Show.

14:21.949 --> 14:24.285
<i>- Got a line on her?
- Hang on.</i>

14:25.911 --> 14:27.788
<i>We've got her, 70-to- 1.</i>

14:28.039 --> 14:30.875
70? It was 60-to-1
10 minutes ago.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.294
<i>So aren 't you glad you waited?</i>

14:33.544 --> 14:37.006
<i>But the odds are bound to go down.
No filly can be that bad.</i>

14:45.807 --> 14:48.185
You found out I was right, didn't you?

14:48.602 --> 14:49.978
I didn't find out dick.

14:50.187 --> 14:53.732
But a horse named Mally No Show's
in the 10th race at Santa Anita.

14:53.982 --> 14:57.402
Somebody's betting she'll
drop dead at the starting gate.

14:57.653 --> 14:59.488
And this is the gate right here!

14:59.738 --> 15:02.407
You see? They're saying
we haven't got a chance!

15:03.116 --> 15:05.495
For all I know,
it's just a coincidence.

15:06.037 --> 15:10.917
It's not a coincidence.
There isn't any 10th race at Anita!

15:12.585 --> 15:13.586
Wagon's outside.

15:14.963 --> 15:16.130
What about that horse?

15:16.422 --> 15:18.800
75-to-1.
Sounds like a real nag.

15:20.134 --> 15:22.887
Go back home. Leave me be.
Call it off. Please!

15:23.137 --> 15:25.056
We're splitting right now.

15:25.306 --> 15:28.310
One of you call Hertz or Avis.
I don't care which one.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.563
Have them leave me a car
between here and the airport.

15:31.814 --> 15:34.316
Leave the keys. I'll pay
once she's on the plane.

15:35.484 --> 15:38.278
If, and I say if,
what you're saying is true...

15:38.529 --> 15:41.949
...somebody's betting I can't do my job.
They're full of shit!

15:42.491 --> 15:46.495
These people laying these odds
will chew you up and spit you out!

15:46.745 --> 15:50.375
You're fucking crazy.
I'm not going anyplace with you.

16:05.473 --> 16:06.808
What about that car?

16:07.058 --> 16:10.771
'74 Plymouth, blue.
It's parked at the Christian Center.

16:11.022 --> 16:12.565
- Who's the driver?
- That's me.

16:12.815 --> 16:14.066
Let's go.

16:14.650 --> 16:16.027
- Just him.
- We're a team.

16:16.235 --> 16:17.570
Next time.

16:48.977 --> 16:50.937
You cheap-shot, gutless bastard!

16:51.188 --> 16:53.191
You get off roughing up girls,
don't you?

16:53.441 --> 16:55.902
Big man!
Big 45-caliber fruit!

16:57.737 --> 16:59.030
That's me.

16:59.572 --> 17:00.698
Macho mentality.

17:00.948 --> 17:04.577
You'll get us both killed
before we get out of here!

17:04.868 --> 17:06.244
Jesus!

17:08.247 --> 17:09.915
Breathe deeply.

17:16.214 --> 17:17.215
There it is.

17:24.348 --> 17:25.348
All right.

17:25.848 --> 17:28.686
Pull around in front.
I'll get her ready for transfer.

17:28.936 --> 17:30.229
Check for the keys.

17:52.377 --> 17:54.546
I'm hyperventilating, you bastard!

17:54.796 --> 17:58.259
Go die by yourself.
I won't get out of this ambulance.

18:27.622 --> 18:28.999
Come here.

18:32.461 --> 18:33.670
- Take this.
- What's that?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.088
It's a gun. Take it.

18:35.339 --> 18:37.799
- I don't want it.
- Take it!

18:38.550 --> 18:40.720
Anybody comes up behind us,
shoot him.

18:40.970 --> 18:43.056
You got to be kidding!

18:48.728 --> 18:50.313
Where the hell are you going?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.857
I'll take a less popular way
to the airport.

18:53.107 --> 18:56.444
After what happened back there?
They'll be waiting for us!

18:56.694 --> 18:59.781
By the time they sift through
that wreckage, we'll be gone.

19:12.378 --> 19:13.462
Pull over.

19:18.384 --> 19:22.304
Until you pull that trigger,
I'm headed to the airport.

19:23.014 --> 19:24.099
I mean it.

19:24.349 --> 19:27.227
I swear to Christ,
if you don't stop, I'll shoot.

19:30.146 --> 19:30.981
What's that?

19:31.189 --> 19:32.315
They're shooting!

19:35.735 --> 19:37.988
- Shoot at them!
- Stop! It's the police!

19:38.238 --> 19:40.031
It's not the police!
Shoot at them!

19:40.281 --> 19:41.366
I can't!

19:42.075 --> 19:44.119
You were ready to
shoot at me, damn it!

20:06.310 --> 20:07.769
Oh, my God!

21:20.053 --> 21:21.638
So we don't go to the airport.

21:21.888 --> 21:23.932
But I'll be damned
if I know where to go.

21:25.392 --> 21:27.519
Six blocks down, hang a left.

21:27.769 --> 21:29.145
Second house on the right.

22:07.394 --> 22:09.187
You got a telephone in this place?

22:09.438 --> 22:10.897
It's over there.

22:14.151 --> 22:15.862
This your house?

22:16.237 --> 22:17.447
Yeah.

22:20.074 --> 22:22.660
What kind of guys do you bring here?

22:23.161 --> 22:24.620
Locals, mostly.

22:24.871 --> 22:27.415
Married men cheating on their wives.

22:27.665 --> 22:30.376
<i>- Police Department.
- Commissioner Blakelock's office.</i>

22:30.585 --> 22:32.086
Ben Shockley.

22:38.135 --> 22:41.972
You were supposed to be
on the plane 15 minutes ago.

22:42.556 --> 22:44.600
Somebody doesn't want
your nothing witness...

22:44.850 --> 22:47.227
...to testify at your nothing trial.

22:47.436 --> 22:51.065
If I'm going to get her to Phoenix,
I'll need your help.

22:51.523 --> 22:54.360
Call the Vegas police
and send two squad cars...

22:54.610 --> 22:58.531
...one for a decoy, the other
to take her to the airport.

22:58.740 --> 22:59.908
Where are you?

23:00.367 --> 23:02.035
Where the hell is this place?

23:02.285 --> 23:04.037
316 Rothdale.

23:04.287 --> 23:05.580
316 Rothdale.

23:05.914 --> 23:08.917
You can't miss it.
There's an ambulance in front.

23:10.210 --> 23:11.336
Yeah, it's a cathouse.

23:12.003 --> 23:13.004
Stay there.

23:13.213 --> 23:16.549
<i>- Where the hell would I go?
- Don 't get smart, Shockley.</i>

23:17.092 --> 23:18.176
Yes, sir.

23:23.307 --> 23:26.644
You win, Shockley.
I'm through fighting it.

23:27.561 --> 23:30.022
I appreciate what you did
in the ambulance.

23:30.564 --> 23:31.774
If you hadn't pulled me back...

23:32.024 --> 23:35.486
My job's just to get you
back to Phoenix in one piece.

23:35.736 --> 23:37.113
I know.

23:37.363 --> 23:38.990
Still, I owe you.

23:39.615 --> 23:40.700
You married?

23:41.242 --> 23:42.661
What do you care?

23:43.328 --> 23:45.288
I'm interested in you.

23:47.541 --> 23:49.376
Want a glass?

23:50.293 --> 23:51.962
It's fine.

23:52.254 --> 23:54.756
Every woman has her thing about men.

23:55.007 --> 23:56.550
Something that turns her on.

23:57.134 --> 23:59.845
With me, it's hands.

24:00.512 --> 24:03.141
I love strong hands.

24:03.391 --> 24:04.892
Like yours.

24:09.647 --> 24:11.274
We have time.

24:15.194 --> 24:17.530
We'll have such a good time, baby.

24:17.780 --> 24:20.408
Such a good time.

24:20.658 --> 24:23.286
You're so beautiful.

24:23.536 --> 24:25.372
You just lie there now.

24:25.622 --> 24:27.082
Just lie there...

24:27.333 --> 24:30.252
...and momma will do all the work.

24:30.919 --> 24:34.298
Somehow I get the feeling
your heart isn't in your work.

24:34.548 --> 24:35.632
You bastard!

24:35.883 --> 24:37.760
Even if we do get to Phoenix...

24:38.010 --> 24:40.304
...I'm not testifying
at any lousy trial.

24:40.554 --> 24:43.390
That's your problem.
My job's to get you there.

24:43.599 --> 24:46.101
You'd risk your life
for something this stupid?

24:46.353 --> 24:47.854
All you've got's your job!

24:48.563 --> 24:50.106
I just do what I'm told.

24:50.357 --> 24:52.359
Yeah? So does an imbecile.

25:01.993 --> 25:04.120
<i>- Information.
- Number for Airwest.</i>

25:05.580 --> 25:07.457
We won't be here long.

25:12.213 --> 25:14.423
Do you mind?
Once we're in the air...

25:14.674 --> 25:17.385
...I'd hate you to worry
I'll leap out the washroom window.

25:17.635 --> 25:18.719
Go ahead.

25:18.969 --> 25:22.056
Air-worst has planes leaving
almost every hour.

25:24.058 --> 25:25.309
Airwest?

25:26.185 --> 25:28.854
When's your next flight to Phoenix?

25:29.105 --> 25:31.566
You have planes leaving every hour?

25:32.901 --> 25:36.196
I'd like to book a reservation
on your next flight for two.

25:41.368 --> 25:43.537
Two people, name's Smith.

25:43.787 --> 25:45.789
We'll be there. Thanks.

26:09.564 --> 26:10.732
Let's go.

26:10.940 --> 26:11.899
You, in the house!

26:12.275 --> 26:14.153
Come out with your hands up!

26:15.029 --> 26:17.072
We got the house surrounded.

26:17.323 --> 26:20.200
Throw out your guns.
Bring the girl.

26:21.118 --> 26:22.703
Fuck me!

26:27.374 --> 26:28.917
Come on, let's go.

26:32.254 --> 26:35.258
Come on, goddamn it!
They've got an army out there.

26:35.550 --> 26:37.052
You've got thirty seconds.

26:45.852 --> 26:46.853
They're shooting at us!

26:47.062 --> 26:48.104
Mally?

26:51.900 --> 26:53.401
Open fire!

28:54.904 --> 28:56.739
Hold your fire!

29:17.138 --> 29:19.599
Captain, they should've surrendered.

29:30.947 --> 29:34.409
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about that passageway?

29:35.284 --> 29:38.038
I'm your prisoner.
I was trying to escape.

29:38.288 --> 29:39.873
What happened?
I heard shooting.

29:40.165 --> 29:42.626
I damn near got cut to ribbons.

29:42.876 --> 29:44.796
Somebody set me up!

29:45.547 --> 29:48.759
Don't blame me.
It was your idea, calling the cops.

29:49.010 --> 29:51.138
Did you shoot at those guys?

29:51.388 --> 29:53.181
I didn't do jack shit!

29:53.432 --> 29:54.850
Then why? What happened?

29:55.100 --> 29:57.060
I don't know what happened.

29:57.269 --> 29:59.355
Let's get out of here.

30:00.023 --> 30:03.985
I don't suppose there's anybody
in this town you could trust?

30:04.235 --> 30:05.821
I don't know. I'm not sure.

30:06.071 --> 30:09.701
I guess in your line of work
you don't make many lifelong friends.

30:09.951 --> 30:11.286
What about you?

30:11.536 --> 30:14.123
Those were cops.
How many friends have you got?

30:14.373 --> 30:16.042
Get your ass in gear.

30:16.250 --> 30:17.084
Here.

30:17.293 --> 30:18.711
Look normal.

30:18.961 --> 30:20.922
I am normal.

30:36.816 --> 30:38.902
- There's a cop car.
- Shut up.

30:53.628 --> 30:56.547
- Do what I say and this won't go off.
- You got it!

30:56.798 --> 30:58.133
Get in the back.

31:09.145 --> 31:10.522
Now go.

31:21.452 --> 31:24.747
Don't get nervous with that cannon.
I ain't no trouble.

31:26.625 --> 31:29.169
Just head right on out there
to the left.

31:29.545 --> 31:32.673
We just left 50 of your buddies,
tried to blow me to hell.

31:32.923 --> 31:34.634
They were nothing but trouble.

31:34.884 --> 31:37.805
You two are them holed up
in that cathouse, ain't you?

31:38.055 --> 31:39.140
Do you know about that?

31:39.390 --> 31:41.392
Every cop in town knows about it.

31:41.643 --> 31:43.603
Just what do you know?

31:43.854 --> 31:46.189
Our dispatcher said
there was this hooker...

31:46.440 --> 31:50.445
...and three men, armed and dangerous,
holed up in a cathouse.

31:50.695 --> 31:54.490
Hell, half the units in this city
must have picked it up.

31:54.741 --> 31:57.077
I don't care what bullshit
came over that radio.

31:57.327 --> 32:00.498
There was just us two in that house,
and I'm a cop.

32:03.585 --> 32:05.880
You think that piece of tin
proves anything?

32:06.088 --> 32:08.299
You can get that out of
a box of Cracker Jacks.

32:08.507 --> 32:10.426
It's real. You look at it!

32:13.430 --> 32:15.974
The two fellas in the car said
you shot at them...

32:16.224 --> 32:17.476
...put them in a hospital.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.313
Why would a cop do that?

32:19.563 --> 32:21.607
They shot at us, that's why.

32:21.857 --> 32:23.150
That ain't their story.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.527
They said you fled
the scene of an accident.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.365
They tailed you
and you opened up at them.

32:28.573 --> 32:30.450
Well, they're full of shit.

32:30.825 --> 32:32.410
Sure as hell, somebody is.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.247
<i>Constable 3- 1-5.
This is dispatch.</i>

32:35.498 --> 32:38.959
You being a cop, you don't mind
if I tell them you're in the car?

32:39.210 --> 32:41.714
You just forget about that.

32:43.257 --> 32:45.134
What's your detail?

32:45.885 --> 32:49.181
You're compounding your problem,
kidnapping an officer.

32:49.431 --> 32:52.226
I said, what's your detail, cowboy?

32:52.476 --> 32:54.561
I got the west side shift.

32:54.812 --> 32:56.189
I just cruise.

32:56.439 --> 32:59.776
Come sundown, I turn in this car
and hang up the hat.

33:00.026 --> 33:04.449
You just cruise out this highway
towards the border, understand?

33:05.409 --> 33:06.701
I'll tell you what.

33:07.452 --> 33:08.912
I'll make you a deal.

33:09.162 --> 33:10.748
If you're really a cop...

33:10.998 --> 33:14.127
...let's turn this clit into the
people who are looking for her...

33:14.377 --> 33:17.798
...and I'll forget the liberties
you've been taking.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.216
You know who they are?

33:19.925 --> 33:22.803
The people looking for her.
You know who they are?

33:23.011 --> 33:25.850
Let's just say
that your story's true...

33:26.100 --> 33:29.311
...about them dudes in the car
shooting at you first.

33:29.687 --> 33:32.899
If them two are examples,
I'd say the folks hunting for her...

33:33.150 --> 33:35.026
...have the initials M-O-B.

33:38.155 --> 33:40.533
You didn't tell me
it was the Mob after us...

33:40.783 --> 33:42.118
...raising the odds.

33:42.827 --> 33:44.245
Who the hell are you protecting?

33:44.454 --> 33:46.874
I'm not protecting anybody.
I didn't know.

33:49.878 --> 33:51.171
Shit!

33:52.672 --> 33:55.509
Now you got the cops
on your ass too.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.095
The good guys and the bad guys.

33:58.345 --> 34:00.765
You're between a rock
and a hard place, boy.

34:01.015 --> 34:04.227
You ain't got a chance in hell.
No, sir!

34:05.520 --> 34:06.856
What do you say, colonel?

34:07.106 --> 34:10.985
Let's us get a taste of her
and turn her ass in. Okay?

34:14.489 --> 34:15.783
Pull over up here.

34:16.033 --> 34:17.284
Pull into this station right up here.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.043
Right here. Stop.

34:26.170 --> 34:28.172
Here, take these cuffs.

34:28.422 --> 34:31.761
Put one bracelet on her hand
and one over the roll bar.

34:32.678 --> 34:33.638
Tough guys!

34:33.888 --> 34:36.224
Big tin-star egomaniacs.

34:44.149 --> 34:46.902
Slide out this side.
Right over this side, here.

34:50.241 --> 34:52.076
Over by that booth.

35:00.293 --> 35:02.630
<i>I ask you under penalty of perjury,
Mr. DeLuca...</i>

35:02.880 --> 35:07.051
<i>... are there witnesses to corroborate
what you've told the jury?</i>

35:07.343 --> 35:09.972
<i>One, sir.
One that I can think of.</i>

35:10.347 --> 35:11.683
<i>Just one?</i>

35:17.565 --> 35:20.151
<i>Detective Shockley from Vegas, sir.</i>

35:21.235 --> 35:22.361
Jesus!

35:28.285 --> 35:29.619
I don't care what you heard.

35:29.870 --> 35:32.790
I'm telling you what happened
and who set me up.

35:33.667 --> 35:34.585
Proof?

35:34.835 --> 35:37.379
Proof against the Mob?
Come off of it, sir!

35:37.629 --> 35:40.133
I've got a scorched ass.
That's all the proof I need.

35:41.009 --> 35:45.013
<i>In the middle of nowhere with
a witness you said means nothing.</i>

35:45.263 --> 35:47.933
And everybody in this town's
shooting at me.

35:48.184 --> 35:50.311
And I'm slightly worried about it.

35:50.561 --> 35:52.021
You've got to bring me in.

35:52.313 --> 35:54.024
<i>I'd like an escort.</i>

35:54.441 --> 35:56.027
<i>A convoy of Arizona police...</i>

35:56.277 --> 35:58.571
<i>... to take me and the prisoner
back to Phoenix.</i>

35:58.821 --> 36:00.364
Where and when?

36:00.616 --> 36:02.993
The Arizona border's
an hour away from here.

36:03.243 --> 36:05.412
I'll be riding in a constable's car.

36:05.662 --> 36:06.705
You copy?

36:06.955 --> 36:07.791
<i>Affirmative.</i>

36:08.041 --> 36:10.627
You'll have your escort.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.463
You'll transfer from
the constable's vehicle...

36:13.713 --> 36:17.427
...to an escort car in 60 minutes.
Can you handle it...

36:17.677 --> 36:20.931
...or should I write it in braille
and shove it up your ass?

36:23.810 --> 36:24.936
Yes, sir.

36:26.896 --> 36:28.106
Take us to the border.

36:28.356 --> 36:31.902
I heard some of that phone stuff
so I guess you are a cop.

36:32.152 --> 36:35.197
So you know I got to call in
at quitting time, which is now.

36:35.447 --> 36:38.327
Call in, tell them you need
the car for another hour.

36:38.577 --> 36:40.788
Say your mother-in-law
was hit by a truck.

36:41.038 --> 36:44.083
Tell them anything,
just make believers out of them.

37:01.688 --> 37:04.149
You mind if I ask you a question?

37:04.983 --> 37:07.069
How many times a month
you spread your legs?

37:08.362 --> 37:10.489
Just drive the car, will you?

37:10.739 --> 37:13.242
I got a chance to learn
something, colonel.

37:13.451 --> 37:16.163
As long as I got to chauffer
the little strumpet.

37:16.413 --> 37:19.958
You mind if a country boy
picks up a little education?

37:22.921 --> 37:24.423
I got this buddy...

37:24.673 --> 37:27.593
...he had the idea we'd open
a string of whorehouses...

37:27.843 --> 37:30.430
...and advertise
like fried chicken places.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.640
"Finger-lickin' good!"

37:36.812 --> 37:38.355
How's it work with your kind?

37:38.606 --> 37:40.608
You go to some kind of special school?

37:41.442 --> 37:43.862
I have a B.A. From Finch College.

37:44.113 --> 37:45.948
Is that where you learned
how to give head?

37:46.199 --> 37:48.910
Will you shut up, for chrissake!

37:49.118 --> 37:51.914
Colonel, you coming to
the strumpet's rescue?

37:52.164 --> 37:55.542
I bet you had some ideas
of getting some gash yourself.

37:55.793 --> 37:58.212
Maybe you already had
a taste of it, huh?

37:58.797 --> 38:01.633
Ain't nothing like
a slice of the damp, is there?

38:02.634 --> 38:04.970
You can't fool Deke.
I seen you zip your fly...

38:05.221 --> 38:07.015
Will you shut up!

38:10.560 --> 38:11.603
Let him talk.

38:15.817 --> 38:18.653
Were you going to shoot
a fellow officer, colonel?

38:19.195 --> 38:22.908
What'll you tell them back home?
I was insulting your whore?

38:25.662 --> 38:27.789
Looks like you done lost
your hero-boy.

38:28.289 --> 38:30.167
I can take care of myself.

38:30.835 --> 38:33.212
Yeah, I bet you can at that.

38:33.504 --> 38:36.049
Let's me and you have a little talk.

38:38.385 --> 38:41.179
Did you ever go down on
another little girl?

38:41.596 --> 38:43.683
Ever have it done to you?

38:44.016 --> 38:46.102
Whores just don't make it with guys.

38:46.352 --> 38:48.355
They make it with anybody
with cash, right?

38:49.022 --> 38:50.650
Bet you do.

38:51.359 --> 38:52.902
Bet I'd like to watch you too.

38:53.111 --> 38:56.072
Yes, ma'am. I'd really dig
watching you.

38:56.364 --> 38:59.326
Them little melons
all pink and tight.

38:59.577 --> 39:02.997
That little ass a-humping
and a-jerking around.

39:03.247 --> 39:06.460
Them long legs
all jacked up juicy-like.

39:07.961 --> 39:10.339
I bet it don't take much
to get you all wet...

39:10.548 --> 39:13.051
...and hot to trot, does it?

39:17.431 --> 39:21.352
Talk to me. I want to know
what it's like being a whore.

39:23.938 --> 39:27.025
Actually, I always thought
it was rather like being a cop.

39:27.275 --> 39:28.611
You did?

39:32.032 --> 39:36.537
Not unlike being on the take at
two dozen bars in downtown Vegas.

39:36.913 --> 39:39.665
Taking money from
some politician each time...

39:39.874 --> 39:44.004
...you peel his drunken kid's Cadillac
off a telephone pole.

39:44.254 --> 39:48.050
Strong-arming the Chicanos
in the barrio on Saturday night.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.886
Busting kids for smoking grass...

39:50.094 --> 39:52.807
...then taking a kickback
from heroin dealers.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.434
Or those occasions
when you do bust a pusher...

39:55.684 --> 39:57.604
...and skim the haul
when you've made the collar.

39:57.813 --> 40:01.274
Sell it to your
dope addict buddies on the force.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.194
She's sure onto all our tricks.

40:05.780 --> 40:06.823
As I see it...

40:07.448 --> 40:10.618
...the only difference between us,
is that when I quit work...

40:10.827 --> 40:12.913
...I take a long hot bath...

40:13.122 --> 40:15.750
...and I'm clean
as the day I was born.

40:15.959 --> 40:17.460
But a cop...

40:17.710 --> 40:19.797
...especially a flunkie like you...

40:20.172 --> 40:22.842
...when sheriff whistles,
you squat.

40:23.092 --> 40:25.010
And what he does to you
rots your brain.

40:25.219 --> 40:27.764
No amount of water
can get you clean again.

40:28.557 --> 40:30.475
You going to take that crap?

40:31.226 --> 40:33.311
You were the one
that wanted her to talk.

40:33.728 --> 40:35.858
I know you don't like women like me.

40:36.066 --> 40:37.693
We're a bit aggressive.

40:37.943 --> 40:39.361
We frighten you.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.656
Because you've got
filth in your brain.

40:41.906 --> 40:44.284
The only way
you'll ever clean it out...

40:44.534 --> 40:46.244
...is to put a bullet through it.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.665
Does your wife know you masturbate?

40:59.469 --> 41:02.180
You've had your chat.
Now drive!

41:44.688 --> 41:47.107
What's going to happen at the border?

41:48.610 --> 41:51.530
We'll pick up an escort
to take us to Phoenix.

41:52.030 --> 41:53.198
Who?

41:54.533 --> 41:55.785
Police.

41:56.494 --> 41:58.371
Arizona police.

41:58.913 --> 42:00.498
How do you know?

42:00.790 --> 42:02.417
Because I asked for them.

42:03.795 --> 42:07.549
Did you call the same person
you telephoned from the house?

42:10.553 --> 42:14.807
When I saw you back in the culvert
you said you'd been set up.

42:17.351 --> 42:19.521
It seemed that way at the time.

42:20.438 --> 42:22.566
What's changed since then?

42:26.613 --> 42:28.157
What are you trying to say?

42:28.782 --> 42:30.534
Somebody's trying to kill me.

42:30.784 --> 42:33.121
Since you're along,
you're a target too.

42:34.622 --> 42:37.375
The car that blew up,
and the guys who shot at us...

42:37.625 --> 42:38.877
...could've been the Mob.

42:40.212 --> 42:43.090
But back at the house,
those were cops outside.

42:43.340 --> 42:46.011
Somehow they got the wrong message.

42:46.386 --> 42:49.724
Maybe it was a legitimate mistake.
Maybe not.

42:49.974 --> 42:51.350
But if it wasn't...

42:51.559 --> 42:54.020
...who would've given them
the wrong message?

42:54.604 --> 42:56.148
How would I know?

42:56.565 --> 42:57.649
Not my guys.

42:57.900 --> 43:00.736
Not the guys on my own force,
for chrissake!

43:01.361 --> 43:03.239
You're probably right.

43:03.948 --> 43:07.912
But let's just say that
there's a chance you're wrong.

43:08.245 --> 43:10.373
Just one chance in a thousand.

43:13.376 --> 43:16.213
The state line's a pretty
lonely place to find out.

43:18.299 --> 43:20.510
Hear what she said
about your own people?

43:20.760 --> 43:23.095
You going to sit there
and take that shit?

43:27.560 --> 43:29.437
How far is the state line?

43:29.687 --> 43:31.439
About 10 miles.

43:35.444 --> 43:38.155
I really do have a college degree.

43:53.841 --> 43:57.345
State line's just beyond
that next rise up there.

43:58.388 --> 44:00.056
Good thing you're out of here.

44:00.306 --> 44:02.309
I ever see you again,
you've had it.

44:21.248 --> 44:22.916
I may be wrong.

44:23.585 --> 44:24.878
But what if I'm right?

44:35.682 --> 44:36.600
Pull over here.

44:38.185 --> 44:39.103
Pull over and stop!

44:39.312 --> 44:40.229
The hell, you say!

44:53.661 --> 44:56.582
I'll leave your gun by the road.
You can pick it up later.

44:56.832 --> 44:57.958
Damn bet I will!

44:58.209 --> 45:00.211
You'll have some fast talking to do.

45:00.461 --> 45:03.298
They'll wonder why you bailed out,
and I'll tell them.

45:03.882 --> 45:04.966
You chose sides.

45:05.217 --> 45:07.761
Got yourself a little nookie
and chose sides!

45:16.481 --> 45:17.482
Shit!

45:17.732 --> 45:18.858
Better get a move on.

45:19.108 --> 45:22.320
If you're wrong,
I want to be there to explain...

45:22.570 --> 45:25.491
...before that asshole
starts spouting off.

46:03.953 --> 46:05.830
<i>Red Fox One, this is Kingman relay.</i>

46:06.080 --> 46:08.417
<i>Has Rabbit arrived yet?</i>

46:09.960 --> 46:11.128
Rabbit approaching.

46:11.378 --> 46:13.755
<i>Ten-four.
Will relay to Phoenix.</i>

46:27.731 --> 46:28.690
How y'all doing?

48:12.479 --> 48:14.107
If it's any consolation...

48:16.568 --> 48:17.652
Nothing.

48:19.529 --> 48:20.990
Shut up.

48:24.911 --> 48:28.790
Never saw a cop feeling sorry
for himself before.

48:29.041 --> 48:30.752
Mind if I watch?

48:34.172 --> 48:37.343
For 2 cents and a stick of gum
I'd kick the shit out of you.

48:37.801 --> 48:40.095
Whatever gets you off, butch.

48:42.682 --> 48:44.601
After I was through...

48:45.602 --> 48:47.771
...where would I leave the $20?

48:48.188 --> 48:51.902
I don't want your money.
I love you for your mind.

49:13.094 --> 49:14.178
Sorry.

49:14.428 --> 49:16.931
Just had to jog your thinking.

49:20.519 --> 49:22.062
You're a loser.

49:22.312 --> 49:23.355
I'm splitting.

49:28.987 --> 49:30.905
You'd shoot a woman in the back?

49:31.155 --> 49:33.157
How would that look on your record?

49:34.744 --> 49:37.038
You'd never make it
alone out there.

49:37.247 --> 49:39.666
With you I don't have a chance.

49:39.916 --> 49:41.501
On my own, I do okay.

49:41.752 --> 49:43.671
I saved you from that constable.

49:44.463 --> 49:46.048
I wouldn't take any bows.

49:46.299 --> 49:50.220
If not for me, you'd have let that
schmuck drive us into the guns.

49:50.429 --> 49:53.348
There wouldn't be guns
if they weren't try to kill you.

49:53.599 --> 49:56.060
It's both of us, you witless idiot!

49:56.311 --> 49:58.188
Haven't you figured that out?

49:58.397 --> 50:00.983
Why do you think
you drew this assignment?

50:01.191 --> 50:03.694
Because I get the job done!

50:03.945 --> 50:06.406
They don't want the job done!

50:06.656 --> 50:08.783
They picked you because
you're a drunken bum.

50:09.075 --> 50:11.871
And if they bump you off,
not a fucking soul...

50:12.079 --> 50:14.081
...is going to give a rat's ass!

50:14.332 --> 50:15.458
You're a nothing.

50:15.791 --> 50:16.709
A nobody.

50:16.959 --> 50:18.922
A faded number on a rusty badge.

50:19.172 --> 50:23.051
You've been set up by your own
people to take the fall with me.

50:23.468 --> 50:25.720
Wake up, for chrissake!

50:25.970 --> 50:30.351
At least that way you'll know
where the bullets are coming from!

50:35.774 --> 50:37.651
Watch out for the sidewinders.

50:40.071 --> 50:40.989
What?

50:41.198 --> 50:44.534
It's a type of rattlesnake
that comes out after dark.

50:45.744 --> 50:47.287
Horseshit!

50:47.663 --> 50:51.376
They're drawn by body heat.
You never know it till they hit you.

51:03.432 --> 51:04.892
I'll leave in the morning.

51:13.318 --> 51:14.653
I will!

51:15.070 --> 51:17.614
I'll make it too. You'll see.

51:26.418 --> 51:29.212
If we were in Vegas,
you'd be just going to work.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.551
Go polish your badge, Shockley.

51:34.218 --> 51:35.678
It's all you've got.

51:36.220 --> 51:37.597
Miserable bitch!

51:39.056 --> 51:42.477
Welcome to the ranks
of the disenchanted.

51:43.813 --> 51:45.607
Shut up and go to sleep.

51:48.485 --> 51:50.571
I'm a counter-puncher, Shockley.

51:51.238 --> 51:55.702
If you can't last the 12 rounds
then stay out of the ring.

52:32.537 --> 52:33.830
Who's DeLuca?

52:37.000 --> 52:40.463
Angelo DeLuca, as in the
State of Arizona vs. DeLuca.

52:40.713 --> 52:41.714
Who is he?

52:43.299 --> 52:45.301
Have you been sitting there all night?

52:46.094 --> 52:48.013
Cut the mother-hen crap, will you?

52:48.265 --> 52:51.059
You're supposed to be
a witness at this trial.

52:51.601 --> 52:53.103
Now who the hell is he?

52:53.353 --> 52:55.940
- Small time.
- Is he Mob?

52:56.565 --> 52:58.067
Who knows?

52:58.609 --> 53:00.319
Talk, for chrissake!

53:00.528 --> 53:03.031
Hell, I guess he is.
So what?

53:03.699 --> 53:07.119
A: The Mob's making book
you don't testify at the trial.

53:07.369 --> 53:11.000
And B: Somebody on the Phoenix P.D.
also doesn't want you testifying.

53:11.250 --> 53:13.544
A plus B equals a tie-in...

53:13.752 --> 53:15.963
...between the Mob
and the police force.

53:16.715 --> 53:19.342
You sit on your ass all night
figuring that out?

53:19.593 --> 53:21.052
Congratulations.

53:21.303 --> 53:22.637
Now, who's DeLuca?

53:22.887 --> 53:25.266
I only met the guy once! Jesus!

53:25.516 --> 53:27.768
I'm no good without coffee.
Lay off!

53:28.019 --> 53:29.979
The time you met him, what happened?

53:30.229 --> 53:32.025
I don't want to talk about it.

53:32.275 --> 53:34.569
Half my force is involved
and you won't talk.

53:34.819 --> 53:35.653
You heard me.

53:35.823 --> 53:37.742
- Who you protecting?
- Nobody.

53:38.034 --> 53:40.912
Me! I'm protecting me!
So lay off!

53:41.162 --> 53:42.412
From what? From me?

53:42.663 --> 53:45.624
Have I tried to kill you?
Or jump your bones?

53:45.874 --> 53:47.668
I'm not the enemy!

53:48.293 --> 53:49.837
Hurray for Mr. Clean.

53:50.045 --> 53:51.505
What did he do?

53:51.713 --> 53:53.674
I don't want to talk about it!

53:54.508 --> 53:55.509
You're the key.

53:55.717 --> 53:58.178
You're the proof
and both sides know it.

54:03.642 --> 54:04.892
Please.

54:15.695 --> 54:18.281
DeLuca set me up with this guy.

54:18.531 --> 54:20.867
Told me to be special nice to him.

54:21.075 --> 54:22.285
What guy?

54:23.286 --> 54:24.662
Someone on the force.

54:24.871 --> 54:25.705
Phoenix P. D?

54:27.581 --> 54:28.498
His name?

54:30.542 --> 54:32.502
I didn't ask.

54:33.044 --> 54:33.962
What happened?

54:41.428 --> 54:43.597
I went to this hotel room...

54:43.847 --> 54:45.265
...in Vegas.

54:48.685 --> 54:50.853
There was this guy there.

54:52.229 --> 54:54.690
He seemed like an okay guy.

54:57.318 --> 54:59.487
I asked him how he wanted it.

55:00.197 --> 55:01.989
He told me to take off my clothes...

55:02.239 --> 55:03.824
...lie down on the bed...

55:04.074 --> 55:05.910
...lie on my stomach.

55:08.495 --> 55:09.955
Told me to open up my legs.

55:11.081 --> 55:12.582
I couldn't see him.

55:13.875 --> 55:15.418
He had this gun.

55:16.920 --> 55:19.590
He took this gun with one hand...

55:19.882 --> 55:21.926
...and he held it there.

55:25.220 --> 55:28.139
I knew what he was doing
with his other hand.

55:31.100 --> 55:32.602
And he told me...

55:32.852 --> 55:35.145
...if I screamed,
he'd pull the trigger.

55:35.354 --> 55:36.188
Describe him.

55:39.525 --> 55:41.569
He was 55, 60.

55:43.071 --> 55:46.490
Blue eyes, gray hair.
Very distinguished.

55:49.201 --> 55:51.245
And he had this face...

55:52.829 --> 55:55.541
...that looked like it was
made out of stone.

55:56.291 --> 55:57.834
And his voice...

56:01.379 --> 56:03.882
...sounded like it came
from the bottom of a tomb.

56:08.512 --> 56:09.345
Blakelock.

56:17.144 --> 56:17.979
Hogs.

56:22.983 --> 56:24.318
You stay there.

56:54.513 --> 56:55.764
Oh, my God!

56:56.765 --> 56:58.100
You wait here.

56:58.350 --> 57:01.103
- Where you going?
- You just stay here.

57:09.612 --> 57:11.947
All right, mother-jumpers!
This is a bust!

57:16.618 --> 57:20.663
Everybody up against their bike.
Balls in your pockets.

57:21.498 --> 57:22.457
Come on!

57:28.713 --> 57:30.507
Don't do that, man! Don't!

57:39.306 --> 57:40.849
Son of a bitch!

57:41.517 --> 57:44.853
The next turkey who tries that,
I'll shoot him...

57:45.062 --> 57:48.273
...stuff him and stick
an apple in his ass.

57:48.649 --> 57:49.775
Any takers?

57:50.276 --> 57:51.944
You? You?

57:52.653 --> 57:53.987
You? You?

57:54.363 --> 57:55.197
Hey, man.

57:56.240 --> 57:57.908
You can't do this without a warrant.

57:58.700 --> 58:01.078
The man says I need a warrant.

58:01.537 --> 58:03.955
The man don't know jack shit!

58:04.330 --> 58:07.291
Anybody here know more
about the law here than me?

58:07.500 --> 58:09.168
Any lawyers here?

58:09.377 --> 58:12.631
Any lawyers want to tell me
why I don't need a warrant?

58:12.840 --> 58:14.799
Why don't you get off our case?

58:15.550 --> 58:17.635
You with the fucking hair.

58:17.885 --> 58:18.928
You look smart.

58:19.554 --> 58:22.640
Tell me why I'm entitled
to come in here anytime I please.

58:26.268 --> 58:27.477
Reasonable what?

58:28.562 --> 58:30.105
Reasonable suspicion.

58:30.355 --> 58:33.067
Exactly!
Reasonable suspicion.

58:33.484 --> 58:36.111
I can do as I please
if I have reasonable suspicion.

58:36.361 --> 58:39.155
If I have suspicion
a felony's been committed...

58:39.406 --> 58:42.409
...I can walk in here
anytime I feel like it.

58:42.659 --> 58:45.036
Because I got this badge, this gun...

58:45.287 --> 58:48.247
...and I got the love of Jesus
in my pretty green eyes.

58:48.455 --> 58:50.166
He must be high on something.

58:50.416 --> 58:52.042
He's just fucking crazy.

58:52.293 --> 58:54.170
Shockley, you idiot!

58:54.796 --> 58:58.591
Mindless, brainless,
stupid, fucking idiot!

58:59.008 --> 59:00.759
Maybe even one of you girls.

59:01.010 --> 59:02.469
Like what?

59:02.887 --> 59:05.973
I don't know what.
And personally I don't give a shit.

59:06.182 --> 59:09.435
The main thing is,
I'll have to bust you all.

59:09.726 --> 59:13.396
Of course, we do have a choice.
Wait a second. We have a choice.

59:13.813 --> 59:17.651
If you get on those bikes and
get out in the next 30 seconds...

59:17.860 --> 59:20.362
...I'll let you off with just a warning.

59:20.613 --> 59:22.739
However, if you give me any shit...

59:22.989 --> 59:24.282
...any shit at all...

59:24.532 --> 59:26.576
...then there's going to be more cops.

59:27.118 --> 59:30.455
More guns. More handcuffs.
More marijuana-sniffing dogs...

59:30.663 --> 59:33.582
...than you've ever seen
in your wildest hallucinations.

59:35.125 --> 59:36.001
Thirty seconds!

59:37.503 --> 59:38.755
Haul ass!

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:14.580
This bike stays with me.
You 3 can take a hike.

01:00:14.831 --> 01:00:17.041
Hey, man!
This is our choppers, Charlie!

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:19.334
This is my gun, Clyde!

01:00:19.584 --> 01:00:20.878
Come on, this game's dead.

01:00:21.128 --> 01:00:23.798
Let's get out of here.
This guy's nuts.

01:00:24.048 --> 01:00:25.883
- Fuck you!
- Take a hike, man.

01:00:26.133 --> 01:00:28.052
What else can you do?

01:00:30.303 --> 01:00:31.137
Pig!

01:00:31.388 --> 01:00:32.264
Asshole!

01:00:34.474 --> 01:00:35.642
You're crazy!

01:00:36.518 --> 01:00:37.602
Ridiculous!

01:00:38.478 --> 01:00:42.022
You're outrageous.
You're just completely outrageous.

01:00:42.524 --> 01:00:43.358
Thanks.

01:00:44.025 --> 01:00:47.028
- Hop aboard.
- Do you know how to drive this thing?

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.240
It's been a few years.

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:54.201
We'll fake it.

01:01:29.736 --> 01:01:32.197
Maynard Josephson, Metro squad.

01:01:32.447 --> 01:01:34.657
I'll get us something to eat.

01:01:38.744 --> 01:01:39.661
Josephson.

01:01:39.912 --> 01:01:42.039
<i>Josephson? It's me, Shockley.</i>

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:43.415
Ben?

01:01:43.749 --> 01:01:45.626
For chrissakes, Ben!

01:01:47.295 --> 01:01:49.588
There's an APB out on you.

01:01:49.796 --> 01:01:50.839
Why'd you do it?

01:01:51.048 --> 01:01:52.049
Do what?

01:01:52.257 --> 01:01:54.801
The constable last night.
Why'd you kill him?

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.679
I didn't kill anybody.
That's Blakelock, you hear me?

01:01:57.971 --> 01:01:58.889
It's who?

01:01:59.097 --> 01:02:00.723
It's Commissioner Blakelock.

01:02:00.973 --> 01:02:02.475
He's tied in with the Mob.

01:02:02.725 --> 01:02:04.810
He's trying to nail me and the girl.

01:02:05.061 --> 01:02:07.271
What girl are you talking about?

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:11.859
The witness at that trial.
Gus Mally's not a guy, it's a girl.

01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:16.155
And if she testifies,
Blakelock knows she'll torpedo him.

01:02:20.743 --> 01:02:21.744
Hear me, Josey?

01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:34.798
Come on!

01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:40.387
What's going on?

01:02:40.637 --> 01:02:42.597
Blakelock's buddies.

01:04:47.926 --> 01:04:49.260
Hold tight.

01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:42.843
Look out!

01:07:43.469 --> 01:07:44.928
Jesus, we're going to hit!

01:08:49.406 --> 01:08:50.533
Let's go.

01:08:57.413 --> 01:08:58.707
We'll never make it.

01:09:00.126 --> 01:09:02.086
Nag, nag, nag!

01:09:13.555 --> 01:09:15.014
Thanks, buddy.

01:09:30.488 --> 01:09:31.863
Hold him! Hold him!

01:09:32.363 --> 01:09:33.365
Stop!

01:09:35.993 --> 01:09:37.286
Let me kick him!

01:09:37.536 --> 01:09:40.205
- Move away from him!
- Let him alone!

01:09:41.206 --> 01:09:43.584
- Get off my hand!
- Get him up!

01:09:54.677 --> 01:09:56.762
Where's your gun, Clyde?

01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:07.064
I'll get his hand.
Hit him!

01:10:07.523 --> 01:10:08.524
Where's your gun?

01:10:08.774 --> 01:10:10.568
Get this bitch away!

01:10:13.237 --> 01:10:14.947
Get away from here!

01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:17.616
Give it to him!
Come on, hit him!

01:10:37.344 --> 01:10:40.513
What are you?
A bunch of goddamn fairies?

01:10:42.765 --> 01:10:44.308
You want to play with boys...

01:10:44.558 --> 01:10:47.354
...or show me if you got
anything between your legs?

01:11:32.105 --> 01:11:33.731
Get her pants off.

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.611
Hold still!

01:12:06.345 --> 01:12:07.388
Get her pants.

01:12:07.597 --> 01:12:09.265
You get her pants, man!

01:12:14.061 --> 01:12:15.438
Get off her.

01:12:42.839 --> 01:12:44.215
You wouldn't hit a lady.

01:13:02.691 --> 01:13:03.526
Mally?

01:14:20.348 --> 01:14:22.518
When's the next bus to Phoenix?

01:14:24.228 --> 01:14:27.147
Next express pulls in at 3 o'clock.

01:14:27.981 --> 01:14:28.899
Thanks.

01:14:29.107 --> 01:14:30.192
You want a ticket?

01:14:31.985 --> 01:14:33.987
I don't think that'll be necessary.

01:14:34.488 --> 01:14:36.490
I heard it's 3 o'clock.

01:14:39.533 --> 01:14:42.036
This whole idea's insane.

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.234
You first.

01:15:19.864 --> 01:15:21.741
Care for something to eat?

01:15:23.742 --> 01:15:25.244
What'll you have?

01:15:26.830 --> 01:15:28.039
Surprise me.

01:15:34.419 --> 01:15:36.296
<i>- Josephson here.
- Josephson?</i>

01:15:36.547 --> 01:15:37.673
Ben!

01:15:37.923 --> 01:15:39.424
Hold on, guy.

01:15:45.346 --> 01:15:46.305
You okay?

01:15:46.806 --> 01:15:48.350
I'm coming in.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:49.935
Coming in where?

01:15:50.978 --> 01:15:52.938
Phoenix. Right to City Hall.

01:15:53.647 --> 01:15:56.108
For chrissakes, that's nuts!

01:15:56.316 --> 01:15:57.608
Will you write this down?

01:15:57.984 --> 01:15:59.235
You can't!

01:15:59.527 --> 01:16:01.404
Please.
Will you write this down?

01:16:03.614 --> 01:16:05.575
All right, all right.
Go ahead.

01:16:06.367 --> 01:16:08.743
I'm taking the 7th Street off-ramp...

01:16:08.994 --> 01:16:11.164
...going down Central over Mesa...

01:16:11.414 --> 01:16:13.249
...straight down Adams to City Hall.

01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:14.750
<i>You got that?</i>

01:16:15.209 --> 01:16:18.463
Seventh, Central, Adams, Mesa.
I got it. But, Ben...

01:16:18.671 --> 01:16:20.506
Five minutes after I leave here...

01:16:20.756 --> 01:16:22.842
...Blakelock's going to hear I'm coming.

01:16:23.092 --> 01:16:24.760
He's going to try and stop me.

01:16:25.011 --> 01:16:29.056
I want you to give him my route.
Tell him to clear the streets.

01:16:29.307 --> 01:16:31.226
That way no innocent people get killed.

01:16:32.519 --> 01:16:33.479
This is crazy.

01:16:33.729 --> 01:16:35.564
<i>And give him this message:</i>

01:16:36.023 --> 01:16:38.525
Tell him I know why
he picked me for the job.

01:16:38.734 --> 01:16:40.110
Tell him he was wrong.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.822
Tell him I'm coming
and I'll nail his ass to the wall.

01:16:44.072 --> 01:16:45.115
You hear me?

01:16:46.325 --> 01:16:47.910
For chrissakes!

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.955
He'll have every cop on the force there.
You can't get in there!

01:16:52.164 --> 01:16:54.751
Thanks, partner.
My best to the family.

01:17:02.675 --> 01:17:04.052
Jesus Christ!

01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:11.226
<i>- Front desk.
- This is 14-A.</i>

01:17:12.393 --> 01:17:15.272
You have anything like room service
around this joint?

01:17:15.523 --> 01:17:17.191
<i>I can probably get you something.</i>

01:17:17.441 --> 01:17:21.028
Maybe you could send your kid out
and pick up some steaks...

01:17:21.278 --> 01:17:24.615
...fried chicken. Something like that.
Maybe a bottle of wine.

01:17:24.865 --> 01:17:26.659
<i>Yes, sir. Anything else?</i>

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:29.787
Is there anything like a florist
around this neighborhood?

01:17:38.547 --> 01:17:41.842
When I was a kid growing up,
I used to hate cops.

01:17:42.676 --> 01:17:45.220
Me and the other kids
in the neighborhood...

01:17:45.804 --> 01:17:48.056
...we'd always get in trouble, fights.

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:49.683
Gang fights.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.103
Always getting rousted by the cops.

01:17:54.146 --> 01:17:57.107
I suppose if we had guns
like gangs do nowadays...

01:17:57.358 --> 01:17:59.819
...I'd have shot every cop on sight.

01:18:02.738 --> 01:18:04.866
Parents never seemed to care.

01:18:05.116 --> 01:18:07.618
Teachers, they forgot how to care.

01:18:09.036 --> 01:18:13.666
As you grow older, you begin
to realize what cops are all about.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:18.797
They're just doing a job,
enforcing the law. Raising families.

01:18:20.299 --> 01:18:24.511
If you break the law you get busted.
That's about all there is to it.

01:18:24.761 --> 01:18:26.763
I learned to respect that.

01:18:28.765 --> 01:18:30.893
I even began to realize...

01:18:31.143 --> 01:18:34.813
...that the only people I knew
that stood for something were cops.

01:18:36.398 --> 01:18:39.067
So when I got old enough,
I joined up.

01:18:41.154 --> 01:18:43.448
I had this dream, boy.

01:18:44.616 --> 01:18:47.368
I had this dream
of meeting the right woman...

01:18:47.577 --> 01:18:48.912
...having kids.

01:18:50.914 --> 01:18:52.332
Most of all...

01:18:52.624 --> 01:18:54.793
...breaking that big case.

01:18:55.293 --> 01:18:58.671
I could just see them pinning
captain bars on me and...

01:19:00.548 --> 01:19:04.637
Well, the years went by, and
never did meet that right woman.

01:19:06.639 --> 01:19:10.142
Seemed like other guys
were always breaking the big case.

01:19:12.394 --> 01:19:15.022
After a while you get to the point
where you just...

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:18.108
...put in your 20
and wait for retirement.

01:19:23.615 --> 01:19:26.910
Now I got the big case
and I'm picked to go down with it.

01:19:28.453 --> 01:19:31.248
You don't have to.
Neither of us does.

01:19:31.498 --> 01:19:33.875
Nobody's forcing us
to go back to Phoenix.

01:19:34.126 --> 01:19:37.629
We could go to Canada or Mexico.
Anyplace!

01:19:37.921 --> 01:19:39.464
Sure. And live like kings.

01:19:39.673 --> 01:19:41.049
I've got some money.

01:19:41.299 --> 01:19:42.592
I've got my checkbook.

01:19:42.843 --> 01:19:45.138
$5000 back in Vegas.

01:19:45.388 --> 01:19:47.306
And when that runs out?

01:19:48.683 --> 01:19:51.727
Then let's take the money
and buy a pickup truck.

01:19:51.936 --> 01:19:54.313
An old sedan,
or something unobtrusive.

01:19:54.564 --> 01:19:57.817
We'll take back roads, turn ourselves
in to some precinct station.

01:19:58.067 --> 01:19:59.569
Anything but City Hall!

01:19:59.819 --> 01:20:01.821
We'll ask for protective custody.

01:20:02.071 --> 01:20:03.072
Talk to the D.A.

01:20:03.322 --> 01:20:05.741
That's exactly what I want you to do.

01:20:06.159 --> 01:20:07.369
What about you?

01:20:07.619 --> 01:20:09.288
Me? I'm going in.

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:10.497
Why?

01:20:10.914 --> 01:20:14.501
We know why Blakelock picked me
for this job. I'll prove he's wrong.

01:20:17.087 --> 01:20:19.006
Then I'm going with you.

01:20:19.298 --> 01:20:21.383
You're not my prisoner.
You can go.

01:20:21.633 --> 01:20:24.344
You get your money.
It's between me and Blakelock.

01:20:24.595 --> 01:20:28.141
You said yourself you didn't
think the whole thing would work.

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:30.143
At least someone'll know I tried.

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:32.312
- Who, Blakelock?
- No, me.

01:20:43.531 --> 01:20:46.284
<i>- Operator.
- Area 2-1-2, please.</i>

01:20:46.534 --> 01:20:48.661
684-6114.

01:20:48.912 --> 01:20:50.372
<i>Just a moment.</i>

01:20:54.752 --> 01:20:56.587
<i>- Hello.
- Hi. Mom?</i>

01:20:57.379 --> 01:20:59.131
<i>- It's me.
- Are you all right?</i>

01:20:59.548 --> 01:21:01.175
I'm okay. How are you?

01:21:02.468 --> 01:21:03.511
I'm in...

01:21:03.761 --> 01:21:04.845
...Wickenberg.

01:21:05.638 --> 01:21:06.597
Wickenberg.

01:21:06.847 --> 01:21:09.892
It's a small town halfway
between Vegas and Phoenix.

01:21:10.142 --> 01:21:13.104
<i>I thought you had
a nice job you liked.</i>

01:21:13.438 --> 01:21:14.981
I quit that job.

01:21:15.232 --> 01:21:17.526
Who wants to be
a secretary all her life?

01:21:17.776 --> 01:21:19.945
<i>That's what I've always said.</i>

01:21:20.195 --> 01:21:22.489
<i>Things always happen for the best.</i>

01:21:23.073 --> 01:21:25.200
Anyway, the big news is...

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.327
...I met this man.

01:21:28.328 --> 01:21:30.122
He's really special.

01:21:30.914 --> 01:21:32.207
You'd really like him.

01:21:32.457 --> 01:21:34.377
<i>If you like him,
that's what counts.</i>

01:21:35.753 --> 01:21:37.088
Shockley.

01:21:37.797 --> 01:21:39.423
Ben Shockley.

01:21:42.176 --> 01:21:46.430
Jesus! What difference does
it make what church he goes to?

01:21:46.681 --> 01:21:50.309
We love each other
and we're going to be married.

01:21:50.685 --> 01:21:51.853
We're going to...

01:21:52.103 --> 01:21:55.566
...settle down in Arizona
and have kids.

01:21:55.816 --> 01:21:57.943
<i>Where are you going to live?</i>

01:21:58.193 --> 01:21:59.444
I don't know.

01:22:00.654 --> 01:22:03.407
We hadn't really decided.
Probably...

01:22:03.657 --> 01:22:06.118
...Northern Arizona somewhere.

01:22:06.368 --> 01:22:08.620
Maybe up near the canyon.

01:22:08.912 --> 01:22:11.665
It's supposed to be
really beautiful there...

01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:14.793
...and you can still get land.

01:22:15.085 --> 01:22:16.671
<i>When are you getting married?</i>

01:22:18.006 --> 01:22:21.593
We've got business we have to
take care of in Phoenix first.

01:22:21.843 --> 01:22:23.761
Then we're going to do it.

01:22:23.970 --> 01:22:25.305
<i>What business is he in?</i>

01:22:25.555 --> 01:22:27.223
I just wanted you to know.

01:22:27.474 --> 01:22:29.976
Look, would you tell Dad?

01:22:30.226 --> 01:22:32.145
<i>What was the young man 's name again?</i>

01:22:32.395 --> 01:22:34.939
Shockley. Just like it sounds.

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.736
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too, dear.</i>

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:44.742
<i>What number, please?</i>

01:22:44.992 --> 01:22:48.662
Give me Las Vegas. 283-8779.

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.415
Up near the canyon, huh?

01:22:53.793 --> 01:22:54.752
<i>Bernie's Book.</i>

01:22:55.002 --> 01:22:56.837
Bernie? Gus Mally.

01:22:58.088 --> 01:23:01.551
Listen, what's the line on
that horse, Mally No Show?

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.221
100-to-1? Perfect.

01:23:04.513 --> 01:23:07.766
I want $5000 worth, on the nose.

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.476
You know I'm good for it.

01:23:11.269 --> 01:23:13.396
She's going to be a winner.

01:23:21.989 --> 01:23:23.407
Let's go.

01:23:38.089 --> 01:23:39.090
Move on out.

01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:40.883
What the hell
you think you're doing?

01:23:41.217 --> 01:23:42.761
What the hell's it look like?

01:23:43.554 --> 01:23:45.556
What's wrong with you?
This is the bus.

01:23:45.764 --> 01:23:47.307
I don't give a damn.

01:23:47.516 --> 01:23:49.184
Get away from that lever.

01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:53.105
Get out of here.

01:23:56.275 --> 01:23:58.527
Let's get the luggage
out of this thing.

01:24:00.028 --> 01:24:02.322
Sorry for this inconvenience...

01:24:02.573 --> 01:24:05.285
...but I'll have to ask you
to leave the bus.

01:24:05.535 --> 01:24:09.622
Please be sure to take your belongings.
Arrangements will be made...

01:24:09.873 --> 01:24:13.418
...for your continued journey
as quickly as possible.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.839
Haul ass!

01:24:26.849 --> 01:24:27.683
You, shorty!

01:24:27.933 --> 01:24:30.436
And you, give me a hand
with this luggage.

01:24:32.438 --> 01:24:34.148
My, this is so exciting!

01:24:34.398 --> 01:24:36.484
Just like on the news!

01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:40.196
Court stands to recess.

01:24:43.199 --> 01:24:44.200
Ralph, ten minutes.

01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:46.619
I don't know if you
remember me or not.

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:48.914
My name is Josephson, I'm Metro squad...

01:24:49.164 --> 01:24:51.166
I'm busy now.
Can you see me later?

01:24:51.416 --> 01:24:54.377
Yes, sir. But you see,
this is about Shockley.

01:24:54.628 --> 01:24:57.881
He and I talked together
just a little while ago.

01:24:58.131 --> 01:24:59.174
You spoke with him?

01:24:59.382 --> 01:25:03.178
Yes, sir. He's coming in.
He gave me his entire route.

01:25:03.428 --> 01:25:06.848
He said some very strange things
about Commissioner Blakelock...

01:25:07.057 --> 01:25:09.060
...and I didn't know who to approach.

01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:13.022
You've done absolutely the right thing
coming to me about this.

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.109
Why don't we go into my office
and talk there?

01:25:25.618 --> 01:25:29.413
There's some quarter-inch steel here.
Get this over by the bus.

01:25:31.583 --> 01:25:33.710
Here's what I'm looking for.

01:25:48.851 --> 01:25:51.061
What's this Josephson know?

01:25:52.188 --> 01:25:54.232
Nothing that can hurt us yet.

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:57.068
Why would Shockley give us his route?

01:25:57.318 --> 01:26:00.321
I don't know.
I haven't had time to melt it down.

01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:02.866
It's a ruse. It's a ploy.

01:26:03.116 --> 01:26:05.869
He's trying to manipulate us
into thinking some...

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.912
I think he's on the level.

01:26:11.749 --> 01:26:13.001
I'll call you.

01:26:13.252 --> 01:26:14.420
Do that, Feyderspiel.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:17.214
Before the whole bucket
blows up under our face.

01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:19.758
You get that trial postponed.

01:26:20.009 --> 01:26:22.094
Have a heart attack.
Perjure yourself.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:23.888
Shockley's got to be stopped.

01:26:24.138 --> 01:26:25.389
Stopped hard.

01:26:45.202 --> 01:26:46.578
So long, folks.

01:26:47.662 --> 01:26:48.872
Good luck.

01:26:55.962 --> 01:26:56.798
All set?

01:26:58.466 --> 01:26:59.300
Ready.

01:27:21.448 --> 01:27:23.158
Hijacked a what?

01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:35.796
Wickenberg-Phoenix.
That's 150 miles of goddamn desert.

01:27:36.046 --> 01:27:38.257
It's 3 hours on that road.

01:27:38.507 --> 01:27:39.676
We could...

01:27:40.718 --> 01:27:43.012
...blast that bus to hell.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.557
Sitting duck, you know?

01:27:45.807 --> 01:27:46.683
Call Vegas.

01:27:46.933 --> 01:27:49.978
Have the boys do it.
Blow the shit out of it, I mean.

01:27:50.186 --> 01:27:51.604
I could make that call.

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:54.149
But the boys don't
do that sort of job.

01:27:54.399 --> 01:27:55.859
It's a little high-profile.

01:27:56.067 --> 01:27:57.735
But they're with us, right?

01:27:58.903 --> 01:27:59.946
Yes, sir.

01:28:00.196 --> 01:28:03.784
But we're talking about
a large bus on a public highway.

01:28:04.034 --> 01:28:05.703
And that's big news.

01:28:05.953 --> 01:28:08.747
Our friends in Las Vegas
don't like...

01:28:09.165 --> 01:28:11.250
They're embarrassed by
that kind of coverage.

01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:15.004
Our boys, then. The cops,
deputy sheriffs, Highway Patrol.

01:28:15.254 --> 01:28:18.424
We've got heavy-duty weapons,
don't we? Bazookas?

01:28:18.674 --> 01:28:20.342
We have the assholes.

01:28:20.593 --> 01:28:23.013
Show some balls!
Blow them away, for chrissake!

01:28:23.221 --> 01:28:26.433
Sir, with all due respect,
this is a very well-traveled highway.

01:28:26.683 --> 01:28:29.769
We don't want blood and tennis rackets
all over the asphalt.

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:30.854
Screw it!

01:28:31.104 --> 01:28:32.856
A few casualties.

01:28:33.356 --> 01:28:36.735
If there are casualties,
other than Shockley and the girl...

01:28:36.985 --> 01:28:39.362
...someone will be answerable.
You.

01:28:39.821 --> 01:28:41.823
I make the decisions.

01:28:42.616 --> 01:28:45.244
Now what is it?
Are there any other options?

01:28:48.498 --> 01:28:50.875
I suggest we let Shockley
drive right in.

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:52.710
Now, we have his route.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.837
We then employ a two-phase plan.

01:28:55.087 --> 01:28:57.882
In phase one, we use his friend,
Josephson, to lay a trap.

01:28:58.216 --> 01:29:00.927
In phase two, we clear
the streets along his route...

01:29:01.177 --> 01:29:04.138
...deploy our men and create
an impassable barrier.

01:29:04.347 --> 01:29:06.183
A gauntlet, if you will.

01:29:06.433 --> 01:29:08.060
He won't have a chance.

01:29:09.937 --> 01:29:11.313
That would work, wouldn't it?

01:29:14.024 --> 01:29:14.942
I mean...

01:29:15.192 --> 01:29:18.612
...we could control
the media then too.

01:29:19.238 --> 01:29:22.991
We'd appear justified, getting him.
It'd be a feather in our caps.

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:26.745
- Excellent thinking.
- Then that's our plan.

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.835
Can you manage? Can you
arrange the thing with his friend?

01:29:32.126 --> 01:29:33.169
Josephson, sir?

01:29:33.419 --> 01:29:34.671
Yes, sir.

01:29:35.046 --> 01:29:37.257
I'll put it in the works right away.

01:29:40.176 --> 01:29:42.137
<i>I repeat to all units:</i>

01:29:42.804 --> 01:29:45.390
<i>Station yourselves as requested.</i>

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:50.479
<i>Battalion Captains will be taking
their orders from this office only.</i>

01:29:50.688 --> 01:29:52.481
<i>Contingency nine-one.</i>

01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:54.775
We're doing this to one of our own?

01:29:55.025 --> 01:29:56.735
You heard Blakelock, didn't you?

01:29:56.986 --> 01:29:58.279
But it don't make sense.

01:29:58.529 --> 01:30:01.991
I mean, if this guy's
the mad-dog killer Blakelock says...

01:30:02.241 --> 01:30:04.827
...why would he supply us
with his route?

01:31:30.208 --> 01:31:32.418
What do you think they'll do to us?

01:31:32.919 --> 01:31:35.421
Whatever Blakelock tells them to.

01:31:35.755 --> 01:31:39.468
Isn't there somebody who can stop him?
The Chief or the Mayor or...

01:31:39.718 --> 01:31:41.679
He's the Police Commissioner.

01:31:41.929 --> 01:31:43.973
He'll do whatever he wants to do.

01:31:44.515 --> 01:31:47.726
He can put an army on the streets
and nobody'd question it.

01:32:07.789 --> 01:32:09.875
You do want kids, don't you?

01:32:13.461 --> 01:32:17.382
Kids, a house, a car, swimming pool.
You name it.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.555
Someplace with trees.

01:32:23.598 --> 01:32:27.643
Someplace with neighbors
not too close by.

01:32:28.144 --> 01:32:30.313
With hills to walk in.

01:32:30.730 --> 01:32:33.357
Horses and a greenhouse, maybe.

01:32:35.234 --> 01:32:38.070
Maybe even a little
guesthouse out back.

01:32:38.321 --> 01:32:39.906
Maybe even a...

01:32:41.783 --> 01:32:42.951
What?

01:32:46.663 --> 01:32:47.956
Nothing.

01:33:06.226 --> 01:33:09.145
You don't even know
if I'm good in bed or not.

01:33:12.982 --> 01:33:15.318
I'll just take that on faith.

01:33:38.676 --> 01:33:39.885
What if he gets through?

01:33:40.177 --> 01:33:41.387
He can't get through.

01:33:41.804 --> 01:33:43.639
He's gotten this far, hasn't he?

01:33:43.889 --> 01:33:46.518
<i>Sir, how many units have you deployed?</i>

01:33:46.726 --> 01:33:48.311
Four dozen? Five dozen?

01:33:48.562 --> 01:33:51.273
And those marksmen
are the finest on the force.

01:33:52.023 --> 01:33:54.526
I know. But what happens if...

01:33:55.527 --> 01:33:58.321
I mean, there's going to be
hell to pay if something...

01:33:58.572 --> 01:34:00.031
...goes wrong.

01:34:00.866 --> 01:34:03.785
The only thing that can
go wrong is if your disciples...

01:34:04.035 --> 01:34:07.707
...decide they can't shoot down
one of their own officers.

01:34:07.957 --> 01:34:09.625
Jesus, they're cops.

01:34:09.876 --> 01:34:12.170
The bastards are paid to shoot,
not think.

01:34:13.421 --> 01:34:15.298
Then we have no problem.

01:34:29.938 --> 01:34:32.566
This is where our
welcoming committee will be.

01:34:35.402 --> 01:34:38.030
Why can't we just keep going?

01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.282
Maybe they won't stop us.

01:34:40.532 --> 01:34:42.326
We could just keep going and going...

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:44.203
Nag, nag, nag!

01:35:07.685 --> 01:35:08.811
What's that?

01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:11.064
Roadblock.

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:13.526
You get ready to hit the deck now.

01:35:20.908 --> 01:35:22.284
They're letting us through.

01:35:23.661 --> 01:35:25.913
Don't want innocent people
to get killed.

01:35:38.927 --> 01:35:40.095
Who's that?

01:35:40.846 --> 01:35:42.806
Jesus! That's Josephson.

01:35:53.692 --> 01:35:55.278
What the hell you doing here?

01:35:56.404 --> 01:35:58.406
Jesus Christ!

01:35:58.990 --> 01:36:01.284
You don't have to do this.

01:36:01.534 --> 01:36:03.286
We've got a friend at City Hall.

01:36:03.786 --> 01:36:05.955
- Who?
- Feyderspiel.

01:36:06.247 --> 01:36:08.583
He's the Assistant D.A.
on the DeLuca case.

01:36:09.167 --> 01:36:12.128
I told him about Blakelock.
He promised to help us.

01:36:12.378 --> 01:36:15.548
He promised to defend you
if you could prove your point.

01:36:15.798 --> 01:36:19.344
I don't trust anybody
connected with the DeLuca case.

01:36:19.678 --> 01:36:21.180
Damn it! Don't you hear me?

01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:23.640
The man is the Assistant D.A.

01:36:23.891 --> 01:36:26.143
The man prepared the whole case.

01:36:26.685 --> 01:36:30.022
Maybe he's the one with enough guts
to go up against Blakelock.

01:36:30.272 --> 01:36:31.899
And maybe they're in bed together.

01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:34.860
Maybe the whole thing's a smokescreen.

01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:36.695
Listen to me.

01:36:36.945 --> 01:36:40.116
I've talked to Feyderspiel.
He's okay, not like we thought.

01:36:40.366 --> 01:36:42.660
Besides, guy, you've got no choice.

01:36:42.911 --> 01:36:46.039
Blakelock's got half the
goddamn police force out there.

01:36:46.247 --> 01:36:48.583
Just waiting for
this elephant to roll in.

01:36:48.833 --> 01:36:49.667
Where?

01:36:49.918 --> 01:36:51.461
Seventh, Central...

01:36:51.711 --> 01:36:52.587
...Mesa...

01:36:52.837 --> 01:36:55.006
...Adams.
The whole route you gave me.

01:36:55.256 --> 01:36:57.967
The place is swarming with squad cars.

01:36:58.218 --> 01:37:02.223
Hell, even with this pig iron,
it's suicide.

01:37:02.765 --> 01:37:04.934
Please. Transfer to my car.

01:37:05.226 --> 01:37:07.186
Stay in the back.
Just stay down low.

01:37:07.436 --> 01:37:10.439
I'll smuggle you into City Hall.
The back door.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:13.442
Feyderspiel and I got it doped out.

01:37:13.692 --> 01:37:16.779
We'll take the service elevator.
He said keep your gun.

01:37:17.154 --> 01:37:19.031
If you think you're being crossed...

01:37:19.281 --> 01:37:22.786
...you can use him for a hostage
to get away again.

01:37:24.913 --> 01:37:28.250
For chrissakes! This man's laying
his life on the line for you!

01:37:32.504 --> 01:37:33.463
What do you think?

01:37:38.134 --> 01:37:40.303
I think it's worth a try.

01:37:44.725 --> 01:37:46.978
Maynard Josephson, meet Gus Mally.

01:37:47.395 --> 01:37:48.229
Hi, Gus.

01:37:48.479 --> 01:37:49.897
Let's go, partner.

01:38:11.044 --> 01:38:13.005
- Oh, my God!
- Get in the bus!

01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:20.304
Get in the bus!

01:38:20.554 --> 01:38:22.306
Son of a bitch!

01:38:29.397 --> 01:38:30.732
He's dead!

01:38:46.748 --> 01:38:48.834
The son of a bitches killed him!

01:38:49.084 --> 01:38:50.669
Blakelock and Feyderspiel.

01:38:51.003 --> 01:38:53.380
Goddamn, motherfucking...

01:39:02.473 --> 01:39:03.807
Stay down.

01:39:04.517 --> 01:39:05.518
We're going in.

01:40:02.619 --> 01:40:04.163
Keep glued to that floor.

01:40:10.544 --> 01:40:11.378
Commence firing!

01:41:16.196 --> 01:41:18.198
Unit 4, this is Unit 5.

01:41:18.448 --> 01:41:19.617
Stand by.

01:41:19.867 --> 01:41:22.411
We failed to stop him.
He's headed straight for you.

01:41:27.792 --> 01:41:30.127
Come here.
Drive this sucker.

01:41:30.419 --> 01:41:31.504
Get up.

01:41:31.796 --> 01:41:33.631
Drive this sucker.

01:41:42.266 --> 01:41:43.517
I don't know how!

01:41:43.725 --> 01:41:46.311
- Do what I tell you!
- Don't yell at me!

01:41:47.062 --> 01:41:48.438
Do what I tell you.

01:41:48.647 --> 01:41:50.023
Drive, please!

01:42:15.049 --> 01:42:16.259
Jesus Christ!

01:42:16.551 --> 01:42:18.219
Oh, my God! Look at this.

01:42:31.525 --> 01:42:32.985
Open fire!

01:43:43.684 --> 01:43:45.185
Just get down!

01:43:45.561 --> 01:43:46.937
Stay down!

01:43:55.530 --> 01:43:57.198
Watch out! Here he comes!

01:44:03.329 --> 01:44:04.414
Cease fire!

01:44:04.664 --> 01:44:06.332
Cease fire!

01:45:47.146 --> 01:45:49.691
I've got a witness here
for Courtroom "G."

01:45:50.108 --> 01:45:51.526
I gave orders!

01:45:51.776 --> 01:45:54.028
They were supposed to kill them!

01:45:54.279 --> 01:45:55.738
I gave orders!

01:45:56.364 --> 01:45:57.323
Shoot them!

01:45:57.532 --> 01:45:58.449
Shoot!

01:45:58.700 --> 01:45:59.660
Kill them!

01:45:59.910 --> 01:46:00.744
Shoot them!

01:46:01.036 --> 01:46:02.371
Kill them!

01:46:04.081 --> 01:46:05.332
Tell them.

01:46:06.292 --> 01:46:07.459
It was Blakelock!

01:46:07.668 --> 01:46:09.003
Tell them about Blakelock.

01:46:09.253 --> 01:46:11.088
Blakelock did the cover-up!

01:46:11.297 --> 01:46:13.799
- What cover-up?
- The DeLuca cover-up.

01:46:14.008 --> 01:46:15.885
He set you and the girl up!

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:39.284
Please speak to me!

01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:41.786
You know I love you.

01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:45.458
Goddamn it!

01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:49.045
Ben Shockley, don't you die on me!

01:46:50.796 --> 01:46:52.548
Open those fucking eyes!

01:46:55.885 --> 01:46:57.720
Nag, nag, nag!

01:47:00.056 --> 01:47:01.390
Get me up.

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.143
