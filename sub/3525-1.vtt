00:10.100 --> 00:13.000
# You woke up
this morning #

00:13.035 --> 00:15.465
# Got yourself a gun #

00:15.500 --> 00:20.600
# Your momma always said
you'd be the Chosen One #

00:20.700 --> 00:23.000
# She said you're...
you're one in a million #

00:23.035 --> 00:25.265
# You've got
to burn to shine #

00:25.300 --> 00:28.300
# But you were
born under a bad sign #

00:28.400 --> 00:31.150
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:31.185 --> 00:33.992
# When you
woke up this morning #

00:34.027 --> 00:36.800
# And all that love
had gone #

00:36.900 --> 00:40.000
# Your papa never
told you about #

00:40.035 --> 00:42.465
# Right and wrong #

00:42.500 --> 00:44.800
# But you're...
you're lookin' good, baby #

00:44.900 --> 00:47.200
# I believe that
you're feelin' fine #

00:47.300 --> 00:49.900
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

00:49.935 --> 00:52.365
# With a blue moon
in your eyes #

00:52.400 --> 00:55.665
- # So sing it now #
- # Woke up this morning #

00:55.700 --> 00:59.300
# Got a blue moon...
got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah #

00:59.335 --> 01:01.300
# Woke up this morning #

01:03.300 --> 01:06.000
# You say you woke up
this morning #

01:06.035 --> 01:08.700
# The world
turned upside down #

01:08.800 --> 01:11.000
# Lordy, well,
things ain't been the same #

01:11.035 --> 01:14.300
# Since the blues
walked in our town #

01:14.400 --> 01:16.700
# But you're... but you're
one in a million #

01:16.800 --> 01:19.500
# 'Cause you got that
shotgun shine #

01:19.535 --> 01:22.200
# Shame about it,
born under a bad sign #

01:22.300 --> 01:25.200
# With a blue moon
in your eyes, yeah #

01:25.300 --> 01:28.165
# Woke up
this morning #

01:28.200 --> 01:31.365
- # Uh-huh #
- # And got yourself a gun #

01:31.400 --> 01:34.400
- # Woke up this morning #
- # Got yourself a gun #

01:34.435 --> 01:37.000
- # Uh-huh #
- # Got yourself a gun. #

01:47.800 --> 01:51.100
# Every night
it's the same #

01:51.200 --> 01:54.400
# I hear your heart
turn cold as rain #

01:54.435 --> 01:57.600
# And although
you'll be gone again #

01:57.635 --> 02:01.300
# I hear
the front door close #

02:01.400 --> 02:04.600
# You say you
got to go downtown #

02:04.700 --> 02:07.500
# I guess there's
someone else you found #

02:07.600 --> 02:10.500
# So why you're
still comin' round #

02:10.600 --> 02:14.365
# Heaven only knows #

02:14.400 --> 02:17.600
# Heaven only
knows just why #

02:17.700 --> 02:21.100
# Lovin' you
should make me cry #

02:21.135 --> 02:24.500
# Make me feel
like I could die #

02:24.535 --> 02:27.867
# That's the way it goes #

02:27.902 --> 02:31.165
# Heaven only ever sees #

02:31.200 --> 02:34.165
# How love's made
a fool of me #

02:34.200 --> 02:37.200
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

02:37.235 --> 02:41.200
# But heaven only knows. #

03:00.800 --> 03:03.400
AJ!

03:07.500 --> 03:09.600
Jesus, Meadow,
chill out!

03:26.300 --> 03:29.300
Inevitably, Sukanya,
what goes in must comes out.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.800
And these people now being released
from prison were jailed

03:32.835 --> 03:35.300
during the big mafia
crackdowns of the 1980s?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.300
Seems like yesterday,
doesn't it?

03:37.400 --> 03:41.000
For years we heard how law enforcement
broke the back of the mob.

03:41.035 --> 03:42.865
Well, they've
served their time.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.100
"It's the old never-ending
battle against crime and corruption,"

03:46.200 --> 03:49.300
- to quote Superman.
- What do you think is gonna happen

03:49.335 --> 03:51.000
with this infusion
of new blood?

03:51.100 --> 03:54.300
We could be looking at a period
of potentially violent struggle.

03:54.335 --> 03:57.500
- They gonna paint everythin' the worst.
- How long till dinner?

03:57.600 --> 04:00.500
- Any familiar names?
- In New York, the only old-style boss

04:00.535 --> 04:03.465
still in place
is Carmine Lupertazzi.

04:03.500 --> 04:07.300
He'll soon be rejoined by Angelo Garepe,
his former consigliere.

04:07.335 --> 04:10.200
Also Philip Leotardo,
long-time Lupertazzi captain.

04:10.235 --> 04:12.600
Can you help me here?
Crush some ice?

04:12.700 --> 04:16.500
- I'll be right there.
- New Jersey's a better case in point.

04:16.535 --> 04:18.665
You've got
Michele "Feech" La Manna,

04:18.700 --> 04:21.200
released just this week,
a man greatly feared

04:21.300 --> 04:23.865
- and respected in the '70s.
- Amen to that.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.400
Similar situation with Anthony Blundetto
in that same

04:26.435 --> 04:28.565
- Jersey crime family, the Sopranos.
- Oh!

04:28.600 --> 04:31.500
- Let me see how he looks.
... still is as far as I know.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.365
28 years old when he went away.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.400
A rising star.
Thought to be the central suspect

04:35.500 --> 04:38.100
in the car-bomb killing
of Thomas Gilardi and his driver.

04:38.135 --> 04:40.700
That's the best picture they could find?
He was a fox.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.600
Will you pipe down?
We're tryin' to watch.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.265
It's my house, Tony.

04:45.300 --> 04:49.300
- What are you watching?
- Go call your brother for dinner.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.900
- Bobby!
- Be nice to have him back, huh?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.465
- Your cousin?
- Missed the shit out of him.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.800
The older you are, the more
you're entitled to eat.

04:58.835 --> 05:00.765
Hi, sorry.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.100
- Where the hell you been?
- Your mother didn't send anything?

05:04.135 --> 05:07.400
She wasn't even home. Her and Aunt Ro
went out to dinner, I think.

05:07.435 --> 05:09.300
Everybody sit!

05:10.300 --> 05:12.765
Now please.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.665
This is great of you,
Aunt Jan,

05:14.700 --> 05:16.800
keeping the Sunday dinner
tradition going.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.765
Can you get the roast
out of the oven?

05:19.800 --> 05:23.700
- Canned clam chowder?
- Go sit, God damn it.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.100
- Oh, shit.
- What?

05:31.200 --> 05:33.565
My wedding ring.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.665
- Goin' to strap on the bag, Ton'?
- Yeah.

05:35.700 --> 05:39.200
Would you say this is an interesting
point in the history of the mafia?

05:39.300 --> 05:42.600
I'd say we're looking at a great year
for crime reporters, Sukanya.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.500
- Anthony!
- What?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.400
I wanna say hello.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.600
Wh... can you stop
a minute?

06:24.800 --> 06:26.965
- How was dinner?
- Fine.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.465
- What'd you have?
- Roast beef.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.200
Did your father pick up his mail
when he dropped you off?

06:31.235 --> 06:34.065
No, he didn't come in.
He was tired.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.900
He said he just wanted to go to bed.
I'm trying to practice.

06:36.935 --> 06:38.700
I see you didn't bring
the power vac in

06:38.735 --> 06:40.200
from the pool house
like I asked.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.165
Why does that even
have to be done?

06:42.200 --> 06:44.665
Grandpa's still gonna
have to lift it into his truck.

06:44.700 --> 06:48.100
I don't want him to have to drag
it from all the way out back.

06:49.900 --> 06:52.800
# It's so nice to have
a man around the house. #

06:52.900 --> 06:56.000
You should've thought
about that before.

06:56.035 --> 06:58.300
What did you say?

07:02.400 --> 07:05.600
Go out and get
that vacuum, now!

07:05.635 --> 07:09.100
What did I
just say?! Go!

07:24.100 --> 07:27.100
Mommy!

07:27.200 --> 07:31.300
Oh my God.
Mommy, help!

07:31.335 --> 07:34.700
Mommy! Mom.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.700
Mommy.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.900
AJ, be quiet,
don't move.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.600
Mommy?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.400
Mommy!

07:51.000 --> 07:52.565
Go get Dad's gun!

07:52.600 --> 07:54.500
It's all the way
in the dining room!

07:54.535 --> 07:56.700
Hey, go away! Go!

07:59.000 --> 08:02.200
Hey! Get outta here!

08:02.235 --> 08:05.000
Go!

08:18.700 --> 08:20.600
How's the olive loaf?

08:20.635 --> 08:22.465
You know what I like?

08:22.500 --> 08:26.100
- I like the Gulden's Brown Mustard.
- Are you leaving?

08:26.135 --> 08:29.200
Yeah, I got a overseas
call comin' at home.

08:29.235 --> 08:31.200
Finish your sandwich,
at least, first.

08:31.235 --> 08:35.000
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no.
- Sheesh.

08:40.299 --> 08:43.100
Could be the same one
from Willow Drive.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.900
God. The most densely
populated state in the country,

08:46.935 --> 08:49.065
- and still this.
- Gone.

08:49.100 --> 08:52.300
He went through your neighbor's
garbage, though, the Kalcheims?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.900
It's been goin' on all over.
If my son had been alone...

08:54.935 --> 08:56.800
You're not gonna
put your trash cans out

08:56.900 --> 08:58.800
until as close
to pick-up time as possible.

08:58.835 --> 09:00.665
- You hear that?
- Put ammonia or bleach

09:00.700 --> 09:04.200
in the container and on the lid.
I posted a notice for your neighbors.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.100
If this had been
a category two,

09:06.135 --> 09:07.900
injury or serious
property damage,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.865
- we could set traps, but not for this.
- God.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.365
You should've busted a cap
in his ass with Dad's rifle.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.500
It's illegal to discharge firearms
within the borough limits.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.300
- You're gonna call Dad, aren't you?
- No.

09:19.335 --> 09:22.000
The great percentage
of them don't come back.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.800
If he does...
call us.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.200
Oh, do you have
bird feed back there?

09:31.300 --> 09:34.100
Ah, duck food,
yes, my husband's.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.200
It's probably what
attracted the animal.

09:36.235 --> 09:38.165
See, the corn's gotten
damp and aromatic.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.100
You might wanna tell
your husband to put it inside.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.100
Right.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.900
Setting up the equipment
is a complicated affair.

09:47.935 --> 09:51.717
Video cameras
with built-in recorders...

09:51.752 --> 09:55.500
- Then the car that he qualifi...
- Hello.

09:55.535 --> 09:57.565
Mmm.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.965
I'm Dr. Lowenstein.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.200
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back.
- What?

10:03.300 --> 10:05.200
- Come on.
- You're kidding.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.900
No, go back, please!

10:07.000 --> 10:09.965
- Why don't you come in?
- I like Nolte.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.500
- Why didn't you tell me last night?
- I'm sorry.

10:12.535 --> 10:14.500
That's a long story,
let's just skip it.

10:14.535 --> 10:16.065
I'll try to think
of a better one.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.100
- What's bothering you?
- Global warming, acid rain,

10:19.200 --> 10:21.700
the national debt?
Never even know what's goin' on.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.800
Look at her nails,
totally real.

10:24.900 --> 10:27.300
- You weren't paying attention.
- Let's face it,

10:27.400 --> 10:29.200
women are more
devious than men.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.200
One of my therapists
was a woman.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.300
Too bad you didn't get
all your talkin' done with her.

10:34.335 --> 10:36.400
You expect a man to be
a tower of strength.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.900
Then when it turns out he's got a few
weaknesses and some insecurities,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
what do you do?
You turn around and you betray him!

10:44.600 --> 10:46.600
So you feel that
your mother betrayed you?

10:46.700 --> 10:48.565
Doggone, I hate
this Freudian crap.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.000
It's not your job to listen
to my problems anyway!

10:51.100 --> 10:53.100
If you don't mind,
I'd like to go.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.400
- You're free to leave anytime you want.
- Good!

10:57.500 --> 10:59.465
Goddamn shrink.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.800
- Who was I kiddin'?
- What are you smiling at?

11:01.900 --> 11:03.965
- I was a champion...
- Nothin', I don't know.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.300
- You have this goofy look on your face.
- Come on.

11:07.335 --> 11:11.000
...until Susan Lowenstein
came along.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.600
Her questions makin' me
as dizzy as her perfume.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.800
- Jennifer Melfi?
- Yes?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
So we open
the fuckin' trunk,

11:52.100 --> 11:56.100
this suffocatin'
Russian cocksucker pops up!

11:56.200 --> 11:59.265
He's still alive!

11:59.300 --> 12:02.500
We lead him through the snow.
This asshole's shiverin'...

12:02.600 --> 12:06.400
he's wearin' fuckin' pajamas
and slippers in like 8° weather.

12:07.700 --> 12:09.365
- Hey!
- Ho!

12:09.400 --> 12:11.000
- Here he is.
- How you doin'?

12:11.100 --> 12:12.365
- Fellas?
- The B?

12:12.400 --> 12:15.165
- Hey, Ton'.
- Radio on the way in.

12:15.200 --> 12:19.000
- Another incident at the airport.
- Fuckin' assholes.

12:19.035 --> 12:21.500
I gotta make
a couple calls.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.300
Anyway, he starts
runnin', the Russian.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.000
Boom! I'm tellin' you the top of his
head came off like a fuckin' bad rug.

12:29.035 --> 12:32.800
What a beating we had to give
this prick, ooh Madonn'.

12:32.900 --> 12:35.500
- Where is he now?
- Who the fuck cares, right, Chrissie?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.265
- Who the fuck knows?
- Poor bastard.

12:37.300 --> 12:40.900
Never would've happened if Paulie
hadn't initially overreacted,

12:40.935 --> 12:42.717
but it's one
for the books.

12:42.752 --> 12:44.465
What do you mean
overreacted?

12:44.500 --> 12:47.165
You choked him with the lamp,
Paulie, or we could've got

12:47.200 --> 12:50.265
Silvio shcarole without havin'
to spend the night in the open.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.900
You let him jab you with that shovel
was the problem. Lets his guard down.

12:53.935 --> 12:55.865
We would've caught up
to the prick

12:55.900 --> 12:59.200
- if you didn't lose your fuckin' shoe!
- Wait, you lost your shoe?

12:59.235 --> 13:01.265
You didn't tell us about that.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.300
"Chrissie, please, don't leave
me out here. "

13:03.335 --> 13:05.000
You little cocksucker!

13:05.100 --> 13:07.400
I covered your ass with Tony
about that whole thing,

13:07.435 --> 13:09.667
and never a word
of fuckin' thanks, ever!

13:09.702 --> 13:11.951
Always playin' that
blood-relation card.

13:11.986 --> 13:14.200
- Tony's little favorite.
- Fuck you!

13:14.235 --> 13:17.100
- What?
- Come on! Come on.

13:17.135 --> 13:19.700
What the fuck?

13:27.700 --> 13:30.600
That was a good story,
damn it.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.817
Tellin' you right now...

13:32.852 --> 13:35.000
it's finished with us.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.100
- Goodbye, Dr. Melfi.
- See you next week.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.965
- Hello?
- Like the flowers?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
And yeah, before you ask,
I am takin' the medication.

13:51.035 --> 13:54.600
How are you, Anthony?
It's been a long time.

13:54.635 --> 13:56.900
I'm great,
actually. You?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.250
Thank you for that
beautiful arrangement.

13:59.285 --> 14:01.500
I see you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.000
You gotta have a sense of humor
in life, right?

14:04.035 --> 14:07.000
- You taught me that.
- And how is life?

14:07.035 --> 14:08.965
Good, good.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.400
Well, I'm separated,
me and Carmela.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.765
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't be,

14:15.800 --> 14:18.800
Well, I always thought
I saw some good things there.

14:18.835 --> 14:21.100
Two healthy kids,
other than that...

14:21.135 --> 14:23.865
look, the reason
I called...

14:23.900 --> 14:26.100
I'd like you to have
dinner with me.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.600
Since we're not in therapy no more
and I'm a bachelor again...

14:29.635 --> 14:31.665
That's very
thoughtful of you.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.700
Unfortunately, because of our prior
clinical relationship,

14:35.800 --> 14:38.600
- I just can't do it.
- What, eat?

14:38.700 --> 14:41.400
- You must be a toothpick.
- You know what I mean.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.600
See, I knew you were gonna say
somethin' like that.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.600
I can't, Anthony,
I'm sorry.

14:49.900 --> 14:53.000
You know, I waited
a respectable period or whatever

14:53.035 --> 14:55.817
- before makin' this call.
- Then you realize yourself

14:55.852 --> 14:58.600
there's something not
quite right about us dating.

14:58.635 --> 15:00.900
No, I'm not
undeterred by this.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.400
- We will talk again.
- Thank you for the flowers.

15:04.435 --> 15:07.300
- And the detergent.
- And the detergent.

15:07.335 --> 15:09.917
Of course,
what's wrong with me?

15:09.952 --> 15:12.500
I don't know,
but we'll find out.

15:12.535 --> 15:14.900
Leave it to Dr. Tony.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.200
- What's the matter?
- The bear. Stay there!

15:53.300 --> 15:55.300
Oh, right,
lock the door.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.800
What, do you think
he's gonna wipe his feet, too?

15:57.835 --> 15:59.300
He'll smash
through the glass.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.700
Now where is
that guy's card?

16:04.800 --> 16:07.100
I don't know.

16:15.700 --> 16:18.465
You've reached Fish and Game.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.400
- If you know the extension...
- Unbelievable.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.100
If not, press zero
for directory.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.900
Hello?!

16:27.000 --> 16:29.700
For hunting and fishing
licenses, press two.

16:29.735 --> 16:32.365
You get a letter from
my cousin in the can?

16:32.400 --> 16:35.600
Yes, Officer Zmuida, hi.
Yes, Mrs. Soprano from North Caldwell?

16:35.700 --> 16:38.100
- We had the bear in our yard.
- What the fuck?

16:38.200 --> 16:40.300
- You're the guys with the pool?
- Yes, it came back.

16:40.335 --> 16:42.000
- Was anybody hurt?
- No, thank God.

16:42.100 --> 16:45.200
- Property damage?
- No property damage either I could see,

16:45.235 --> 16:47.000
but I didn't really
wanna go out there.

16:47.100 --> 16:49.000
Oh, one of those
Eastern black bears?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.700
- We'll be up in about an hour.
- Yes, that'd be great,

16:51.735 --> 16:54.000
- Okay, we'll be here.
- All right, see you then.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.865
Jesus Christ,
when did this happen?

16:55.900 --> 16:59.200
The first time Sunday night,
and I saw it again just now.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.865
AJ didn't even
mention it to you

17:00.900 --> 17:02.800
- when you two went to the game?
- No!

17:04.200 --> 17:05.865
I have to warn
the Cusamanos.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.500
They keep Esterhaz chained up
along the side there.

17:08.535 --> 17:10.500
That bear will
rip him to pieces.

17:15.900 --> 17:19.200
Cusamanos weren't home.
Got the machine.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.400
Well, I don't
see Esterhaz.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.150
Why didn't you call me
when this first happened?

17:27.185 --> 17:29.292
I called the cops.
They called Fish and Game.

17:29.327 --> 17:31.365
Are you tryin'
to prove you're independent?

17:31.400 --> 17:34.465
This isn't "Little House on the
Prairie. " Those things are dangerous.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.700
The ranger, whatever, said it was your
duck food out there that attracted it.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.100
I never heard of that
happening before.

17:43.135 --> 17:45.300
Trapper Joe over here.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.165
Hmm.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.800
We didn't find a spoor.

17:56.900 --> 18:00.000
I was just tellin' the gentleman
the animal still doesn't meet

18:00.100 --> 18:02.100
- the parameters for removal.
- Oh, Jeez.

18:02.135 --> 18:04.365
So, when somebody's
leg is gone...

18:04.400 --> 18:06.800
Problem is it hasn't
really threatened anybody.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.400
Sorry.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.500
Whoa, whoa,
hold on a minute.

18:19.535 --> 18:21.900
You and your pal
buy some new...

18:21.935 --> 18:23.600
lanyards for
your whistles.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.650
Oh, we can't
accept that.

18:25.685 --> 18:27.600
And we don't
have whistles.

18:27.635 --> 18:29.600
Thanks, though.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.100
Ranger Rick's a little light
in the timberlands, huh?

18:39.135 --> 18:41.500
Everybody's always
gay with you.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.200
He's a good-looking guy,
that's all.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.900
I already put
the ammonia on the cans,

18:52.935 --> 18:54.900
I told you.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.200
Look, I came here
to give you your money, but...

19:17.235 --> 19:20.000
this bear thing,
though, I'm... I'm...

19:20.035 --> 19:21.965
I'm worried.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.500
You and AJ here
by yourselves.

19:24.535 --> 19:27.267
What can we do?
You want coffee?

19:27.302 --> 19:30.000
Last time it had
a weird taste.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.265
The coffeemaker
is shot.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.365
The heating element
is corroded, I told you.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.600
That's not the problem.
You don't need another one.

19:36.635 --> 19:40.200
Last month, it was
the upstairs toilet. Basta.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.600
He goes down the street
to Willow Drive, too,

19:42.700 --> 19:44.600
maybe he'll
stay down there.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.665
All right, look,

19:46.700 --> 19:49.465
you and AJ, you check
yourself into a hotel

19:49.500 --> 19:53.100
until this thing blows over. Here's
1,200 extra on top of our agreement.

19:53.135 --> 19:55.117
- I'm not going to a hotel.
- Why not?

19:55.152 --> 19:57.065
I don't wanna break
Anthony's routines.

19:57.100 --> 19:59.500
He'll get a kick out of it.
It's an adventure.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.665
God knows he loves
room service.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.400
Yeah, I'll give him room service...
the end of my foot.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.900
What's with the attitude?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.800
Well, he's an asshole,
that's what.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.700
- So what? It's his age.
- Yeah, thank you, I know.

20:12.735 --> 20:14.365
But you buy him
too much stuff,

20:14.400 --> 20:17.000
I think because you feel
guilty about the separation.

20:17.035 --> 20:19.865
Excuse me.
It wasn't my idea.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.900
There is more than one way
to ask for something.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.050
- Could we please not?
- Spend $5,000 on a set of drums...

20:26.085 --> 20:30.100
SAT tutor, coffeemaker,
I gotta fight you tooth and nail.

20:30.135 --> 20:32.017
All I said was
I wanna see statements

20:32.052 --> 20:33.900
from the tutor
or he doesn't get paid!

20:34.000 --> 20:36.500
He's a college kid, Tony,
he's not set up for that.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.800
You worried he's gonna
soak you for an extra pencil?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.100
Oh, rimshot!

20:41.200 --> 20:44.100
What I think, Tony, is you're
trying to make my life now

20:44.135 --> 20:46.100
as hard on me
financially as possible.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.900
- Oh, it should be easy.
- Unbelievable.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.300
What do you think,
you're the only Catholic here?

20:51.400 --> 20:55.400
I'm old school. I don't believe in this
separation shit and divorce,

20:55.435 --> 20:58.600
even if my wife was going
after some fucking immigrant!

21:00.200 --> 21:03.300
Yet you are modern enough to use
a cell phone to call Italy

21:03.335 --> 21:06.400
and every other fucking place
to threaten the guy's life.

21:06.435 --> 21:08.865
Oh, that's right.
Certain people see him,

21:08.900 --> 21:12.900
- he's a dead man.
- He had coffee here, Tony, that's all.

21:12.935 --> 21:14.817
And now
the coffeemaker sucks.

21:14.852 --> 21:16.700
How do you like
them apples?

21:19.700 --> 21:22.500
You don't wanna stay at a hotel,
you suit yourself.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.000
This is Anthony.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.650
Could you call me
at 973-555-1299?

21:33.685 --> 21:37.200
I'm thinking maybe
I gotta come back,

21:37.300 --> 21:41.000
you know,
for therapy.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.700
- Smells good, Feech.
- Yeah?

21:43.800 --> 21:47.265
- You want a taste?
- Nah, I'll wait.

21:47.300 --> 21:51.100
No offense, kid, but don't look to me
like you do a lot of waiting.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.465
Just like
his old man, huh?

21:53.500 --> 21:56.700
Lotta changes since
you went away, huh?

21:56.735 --> 21:58.765
20 years, Madonn'.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.400
Know what the biggest change for me is?
Broads shaving their bushes.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.500
I went over to Silvio's, it's like
the Girl Scouts over there.

22:05.535 --> 22:08.565
I think I'll let
this simmer a bit.

22:08.600 --> 22:12.100
Must be different in the can now,
not like the old days.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.065
Fuckin' animals.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.200
It's all about
setting a precedent.

22:17.300 --> 22:20.100
First day there,
I walk in a mess,

22:20.135 --> 22:22.900
I'm wearin' a puss,
a fuckin' scowl.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.200
I look around...

22:25.300 --> 22:27.200
My nephew.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.500
Right in the middle
of my story!

22:30.535 --> 22:32.700
There he is,
the man, the legend,

22:32.735 --> 22:34.465
Feech La Manna.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.800
Hey, my God
look at you!

22:36.835 --> 22:38.865
You big galoot!

22:38.900 --> 22:41.500
What'd you go straight
from the joint to Earl Scheib?

22:41.535 --> 22:45.165
Look at this fucking tan.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.365
You close the cellar door
when you came up?

22:47.400 --> 22:50.400
It's like the Bowery Boys in here
with this house arrest here.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.700
Code words
and secret passages.

22:52.800 --> 22:55.400
- He's in the middle of a story.
- When isn't he?

22:55.500 --> 22:58.500
Hey.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.900
It's day one,
I'm in the mess,

23:02.000 --> 23:04.765
I look around
and I spot

23:04.800 --> 23:08.465
the biggest, blackest motherfucker
that I can find.

23:08.500 --> 23:11.600
Everybody's looking at me
and I walk right up to him and I say,

23:11.635 --> 23:15.300
"What the fuck are you looking at?"
He says, "What?"

23:15.335 --> 23:17.267
I said, "You heard me,
motherfucker.

23:17.302 --> 23:19.165
What the fuck
are you looking at?!"

23:19.200 --> 23:22.500
With that, I hit him! Bam!
Right across the fucking coconut!

23:22.535 --> 23:24.300
He goes down,
I'm on top of him.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.700
Everybody around!
He gets some shots in.

23:26.735 --> 23:28.800
Everybody's going
fucking crazy!

23:28.900 --> 23:30.900
The screws,
this guy, everybody!

23:30.935 --> 23:33.000
"Motherfucker!"

23:33.100 --> 23:36.200
From that time on,

23:36.300 --> 23:38.150
nobody so much as
looks at me cross-eyed!

23:38.185 --> 23:40.000
- Well, welcome home, huh?
- Cent'anni.

23:40.100 --> 23:44.000
- Welcome home.
- Welcome home.

23:46.600 --> 23:50.000
The reason I wanted to see you,
Junior, Tony too,

23:50.100 --> 23:53.000
now that I'm out,
I'd like to get back in the game.

23:53.035 --> 23:55.065
What'd you
have in mind?

23:55.100 --> 23:56.900
You know me,
I'm an entrepreneur.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.900
Get my shy going,
sports book, whatever you say.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.400
As long as you don't
step on anybody's toes.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.600
Me?
I'm Fred Astaire.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.400
What's this
Feech tells me,

24:16.500 --> 24:18.500
you got a bear
up there at the house?

24:18.600 --> 24:22.265
What, it's on fucking CNN?

24:22.300 --> 24:25.250
No, it's just that your wife's up there,
and the kids...

24:25.285 --> 24:28.200
your ex-wife, whatever.
It's just that wild animals,

24:28.235 --> 24:30.400
they're dangerous.
People talk.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.200
What people? Who?

24:32.300 --> 24:34.300
I don't know.

24:38.300 --> 24:42.300
What am I supposed to do, go up there
personally and set fucking bear traps?

24:42.335 --> 24:45.400
We're separated,
for Christ's sake.

24:52.500 --> 24:55.200
So, where's the dinner at?

24:55.300 --> 24:58.000
Oh, I forget the name.
It's in the car.

24:58.035 --> 25:00.000
Who's gonna be there?

25:00.100 --> 25:03.100
What are you,
on the school paper? Guys.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.400
It's business.

25:06.400 --> 25:09.100
- You got any cash?
- Some.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.200
Hand me my bag.

25:17.700 --> 25:21.165
- That's all you got?
- It's like $400.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.850
I'm low man tonight,
I gotta pay for everybody.

25:23.885 --> 25:26.500
You know, this is fucking
ridiculous, Christopher.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.700
Why should you get stuck all the time?
You should make Paulie pay.

25:29.735 --> 25:32.300
What, I make the rules now?
Guy's a captain.

25:32.335 --> 25:35.565
I know, but when
he was in jail...

25:35.600 --> 25:38.400
All's I'm saying is if you get
the extra responsibilities,

25:38.500 --> 25:40.200
you should get
the benefits, too.

25:42.300 --> 25:44.100
You're right.

25:45.300 --> 25:47.900
I'll say hello
to the guys from you.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.600
Benny, hi!
Come on in.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.000
Tony sent me. He says he wants somebody
stationed in the yard.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.250
- He's worried the bear might come back.
- What?

26:14.285 --> 26:16.365
- No, I don't want this.
- We'll switch off,

26:16.400 --> 26:19.700
- me and Paulie Germani.
- This is silly, I'm gonna call him.

26:19.735 --> 26:21.800
Actually, it's not
that silly, Mrs. S.

26:21.900 --> 26:25.200
If it was my family, I'd wanna know
there was a male at the house, too.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.300
What can you do about it
if it does come back?

26:27.400 --> 26:29.165
Tony said you should
unlock the closet,

26:29.200 --> 26:32.400
- give me the "shkupit" he called it.
- Oh, for God's sake.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.100
We'll call
the Fish and Game, too.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.500
It's just... I'll have
the weapon in case.

26:36.535 --> 26:38.800
He's just worried
about you, that's all.

26:38.835 --> 26:41.300
And Anthony.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.000
Okay, I don't know.

26:46.200 --> 26:48.200
You're very nice
to do this.

26:48.235 --> 26:50.200
Nice got nothing
to do with it.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.700
Stay inside. You don't have to sit
out there like a fistful of dollars.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.700
Tony said not in the house.
I got my little Sony in the car.

27:00.200 --> 27:03.100
You want something to eat?
We were just about to sit down.

27:03.135 --> 27:06.100
Nah, I'm good.
I just stopped at Tio Pepe's.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.900
This freaking olive oil.
The food's drenched.

27:11.935 --> 27:13.565
That's the reason
it happened.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.600
As far as fucking bears
are concerned?

27:15.635 --> 27:17.465
I say get rid
of them all.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.900
They had their turn,
and now we got ours.

27:19.935 --> 27:22.265
That's why dinosaurs
don't exist no more.

27:22.300 --> 27:24.500
- Wasn't it a meteor?
- They're all meat eaters.

27:24.535 --> 27:27.467
- Meteor, meteor.
- Take it easy.

27:27.502 --> 27:30.400
Gentlemen,
whenever you're ready.

27:36.600 --> 27:39.000
- All right, are we set?
- Yeah, sure.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.500
What are you doing,
you ready?

27:42.535 --> 27:44.665
I gotta make
a pit stop.

27:44.700 --> 27:47.200
Eh, you forgetting
something?

27:47.235 --> 27:49.700
You get it.
I got the last one.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.800
Here, baby, have some
more cheesecake.

27:52.900 --> 27:56.600
The other thing with bears is: if you're
ever chased by one, run downhill.

27:56.635 --> 27:59.900
- For some reason, they can't do that.
- It's the moss.

27:59.935 --> 28:02.300
They attack when you're
having your period, too.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.600
No, no,
that's jungle cats.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.865
- So can we go?
- Hold your horses.

28:06.900 --> 28:09.800
- What's goin' on, we ready or what?
- Yeah.

28:15.900 --> 28:18.500
- Fine, I'll get it.
- Gimme the fucking thing.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.700
- I said I'll get it.
- Enough. It's done.

28:42.500 --> 28:44.800
- $860.00.
- What?

28:44.900 --> 28:47.300
You heard me.
That's what you owe from last night.

28:47.400 --> 28:49.565
You said, you got it.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.165
I only got like
$100 on me, anyways.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.900
Then get the rest by tonight
or you start paying points.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.400
I'm thinking of going
for the acupuncture.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.565
- What, your shoulder again?
- Those long drives.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.850
- It's already tender.
- Next time, we get you out there.

29:09.885 --> 29:13.100
After 18 years in the can,
I'm just happy to be outside.

29:13.135 --> 29:15.800
What, they don't have
a golf course at Leavenworth?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.300
Still a smart ass,
this one.

29:19.335 --> 29:21.165
Carmine,
you all right?

29:21.200 --> 29:23.750
You barely touched
your egg salad.

29:23.785 --> 29:26.300
Too much gherkins.
You smell that?

29:26.335 --> 29:28.200
- What?
- Burning hair.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.200
I smell cut grass.

29:32.300 --> 29:36.000
- Any word on your cousin getting out?
- Who's your cousin again?

29:36.035 --> 29:38.500
- Tony Blundetto.
- Oh, yeah, good guy.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.800
Right, right.
He was my best buddy inside.

29:41.900 --> 29:45.500
- So you gonna give him a party?
- When he get home, get him laid.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.900
What's the matter,
Carmine?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.500
- Carmine?
- Jesus Christ!

29:49.600 --> 29:51.100
- Call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.765
Is he breathing?

29:52.800 --> 29:55.000
- Get that egg salad out of his mouth.
- Hurry up!

30:06.000 --> 30:08.400
- Lupertazzi residence.
- Carmine, it's John.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.100
Hey, John boy,
how's the weather?

30:11.200 --> 30:14.350
Look, I got some bad news.
Your dad's had a stroke.

30:14.385 --> 30:17.500
- Oh my God, how bad?
- There's some paralysis.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.000
It's too early to tell yet.
They're doing everything they can.

30:20.100 --> 30:23.000
- Is my mom there?
- I just called her, she's on her way.

30:23.100 --> 30:24.500
We're over
at St. Vincent's.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.600
Anything, John,
anything he needs.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.300
I'm on the next plane.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.600
Sad, this shit, huh?

30:35.300 --> 30:38.200
I wonder if I can
smoke in here.

30:38.300 --> 30:42.200
You know, I haven't forgotten
our arrangement last year,

30:42.235 --> 30:44.565
you leaving me
in the lurch like that.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.800
It was the right thing to do, John.
Taking out a boss? Come on.

30:47.835 --> 30:50.000
- Even still.
- What do you want, an apology?

30:50.035 --> 30:52.000
Fucking Whitman Sampler,
what?

30:58.700 --> 31:01.600
Boy, imagine if his
fucking speech is affected.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.800
Poor bastard.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.600
When you're up at the house,
who comes to visit? Anybody?

31:16.635 --> 31:20.000
Mostly Rosalie Aprile,
Sil's wife.

31:20.035 --> 31:21.665
Who calls on the phone?

31:21.700 --> 31:23.800
Most of the calls seem
to be for Anthony.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.000
So...?

32:15.100 --> 32:17.600
Look, the real
reason I'm here

32:17.700 --> 32:19.765
is to confront you

32:19.800 --> 32:23.300
in a positive way about
taking our relationship

32:23.335 --> 32:25.965
in that other direction.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.650
Why did you have
to be underhanded?

32:28.685 --> 32:31.265
I don't find that
appealing, frankly.

32:31.300 --> 32:33.500
I was gonna ask you out
for coffee or something,

32:33.600 --> 32:35.100
but I didn't think you'd go.

32:35.200 --> 32:37.500
I'll pay for the hour,
that goes without saying.

32:37.535 --> 32:39.100
Forget that.

32:39.200 --> 32:43.200
I was listening
to that guy on TV, Dr. Phil?

32:43.300 --> 32:45.800
And he was talking about
a similar situation

32:45.900 --> 32:48.665
and he said that you could,
if you wanted to.

32:48.700 --> 32:52.000
There's no set rules.
It's basically about malpractice,

32:52.100 --> 32:55.100
- and you probably couldn't get sued.
- That's not the point.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.100
Look, I was thinking about
all kinds of moves...

33:07.135 --> 33:09.065
"Buy her a piece
of jewelry.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.065
Pay the guy to close down
the restaurant

33:11.100 --> 33:13.500
where she eats lunch
and hire a mandolin player. "

33:13.535 --> 33:15.400
This is the place
where we've been

33:15.500 --> 33:17.565
most honest
with each other.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.400
And that's the way
I always liked it.

33:20.435 --> 33:22.365
So that being said,

33:22.400 --> 33:25.300
if you don't like me
personally,

33:25.400 --> 33:28.100
or the cut of my jib,
or my face, or whatever,

33:28.200 --> 33:31.600
then the matter will end here
and I will never ask you again.

33:32.900 --> 33:35.600
You can be honest.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.800
I like you, Anthony.

33:40.900 --> 33:43.450
And, no, you have
a very nice face.

33:43.485 --> 33:46.000
- Working on the weight, too.
- Good.

33:48.100 --> 33:51.000
Explain to me, okay,

33:51.100 --> 33:54.800
why this is a matter
of such importance to you.

33:54.835 --> 33:56.867
There must be plenty
of women out there.

33:56.902 --> 33:58.900
You're different
from what's out there,

33:59.000 --> 34:01.100
not to mention being
drop-dead beautiful.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.465
My training teaches me
to go fairly quickly

34:04.500 --> 34:08.400
to the idea that what you really
want is to come back to therapy.

34:08.500 --> 34:10.699
Jesus Christ Almighty,
come on, will you?!

34:10.800 --> 34:14.800
Your marriage of 20-something
years has collapsed,

34:14.835 --> 34:17.065
no doubt there are issues
with your children.

34:17.100 --> 34:19.900
Why can't I do something that's just
for me for a change?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.100
It would be for you.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.864
All right,
well, I want you.

34:25.900 --> 34:28.600
And not just for the smart things
you say. I-I-I want...

34:28.635 --> 34:32.900
I want your skin.
I want your mouth.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.900
I want your eyes.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.800
You project all these
qualities onto me.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.300
You don't know me.

34:41.400 --> 34:45.199
This is what happens
between doctor and patient.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.800
Don't do that.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.200
Outta respect
for this office.

35:20.500 --> 35:22.465
You know,
forget about the way

35:22.500 --> 35:24.900
that Tony Soprano
makes his way in the world,

35:24.935 --> 35:27.200
that's just
to feed his children.

35:27.235 --> 35:29.265
There's two Tony Sopranos.

35:29.300 --> 35:31.400
You've never seen
the other one.

35:31.435 --> 35:33.500
That's the one
I wanna show to you.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.465
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:17.500 --> 36:20.900
- I... I wonder if I could use the WC?
- Of course, come on in.

36:20.935 --> 36:23.600
- Yeah, okay.
- Is it cold out?

36:23.700 --> 36:27.000
Yeah, a little,
but I got a fleece.

36:47.300 --> 36:52.000
I know him, he'll just keep coming
back and coming back.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.000
How to let him
down easy, I...

36:54.100 --> 36:57.200
- Think it's worth telling the police?
- What?

36:57.300 --> 36:59.600
Jesus, Elliot.

36:59.700 --> 37:02.000
I don't want to paint
in somber tones here,

37:02.035 --> 37:03.565
but the man is a sociopath,

37:03.600 --> 37:06.700
unpracticed in not
getting what he wants.

37:06.735 --> 37:09.100
And now, since
the therapy is kaput,

37:09.200 --> 37:12.500
what use are you to him
except for sex?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.400
Thank you, Elliot.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.700
Your depth of feeling is
really quite extraordinary here.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.200
All you could come up with
was this weak borscht

37:21.300 --> 37:23.800
about professional ethics,
because you are worried

37:23.900 --> 37:26.300
about how this thug
will handle rejection.

37:27.900 --> 37:30.100
You know, at first

37:30.200 --> 37:33.000
I did find him a little sexy...

37:33.035 --> 37:35.367
dangerous, alpha male...

37:35.402 --> 37:38.201
but as year followed year,

37:38.236 --> 37:41.000
the ugliness I saw, I heard...

37:41.100 --> 37:43.665
You kept him
a long time, though.

37:43.700 --> 37:48.600
There's a mutual sympathy
there of some kind, I guess.

37:48.635 --> 37:50.900
Maybe it's just
the Italian thing.

38:02.100 --> 38:05.200
- Sil said you were looking for me?
- Sit down.

38:10.100 --> 38:12.250
This about
the Easter baskets?

38:12.285 --> 38:14.400
I don't even
know what that is,

38:14.500 --> 38:16.750
and, to tell you the truth,
I don't wanna know.

38:16.785 --> 38:19.000
Now what's this shit
between you and Paulie?

38:19.100 --> 38:22.100
- You chiseled him out of a dinner?
- I chiseled him?

38:22.135 --> 38:25.300
- He said that?
- I asked you a question.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.865
Can I say something
in my own defense?

38:27.900 --> 38:30.600
It's not right that
I have to pay all the time.

38:30.700 --> 38:32.800
I've been paying
for fucking years.

38:32.900 --> 38:36.200
You done? Good.

38:36.300 --> 38:39.600
You pay till I tell you
you don't have to pay no more.

38:39.635 --> 38:42.265
And don't give me
that face.

38:42.300 --> 38:45.500
You know how many tabs, how many
dinners I picked up over the years?

38:45.535 --> 38:47.800
I got Richie Aprile,
fat fucking Jerry Anastasia.

38:47.835 --> 38:50.365
Those guys killed me
at Benihana's.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.900
And forget it, if they want a steak.
I put a new wing on Peter Luger's.

38:53.935 --> 38:56.665
Brandy, cigars, champagne.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.500
Could've bought
a fucking plane.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.800
I hear you, Ton',
but that was before inflation...

39:00.835 --> 39:03.000
Whatever.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.400
It's tradition.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.600
It's like in ancient times,
the samurais,

39:07.635 --> 39:09.400
they had these pages...

39:09.500 --> 39:11.550
young boys that
did their errands,

39:11.585 --> 39:13.600
washed their clothes,
shit like that.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.200
It's a sign of respect.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.865
Why don't you cheer up?

39:19.900 --> 39:22.800
One day, some kid'll be
paying for your dinners.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.600
Atlantic City loves
its oldies on Oldies 98.3.

39:28.635 --> 39:31.300
# Now that you're gone... #

39:33.000 --> 39:35.700
So the Pope says,
"Just-a one-a more thing:

39:35.800 --> 39:37.900
She gotta have-a
big-a tits. "

39:38.000 --> 39:40.800
Oh, man!

39:41.800 --> 39:43.200
That was good!

39:43.300 --> 39:45.600
You okay, Ton'?
You're being like a little quiet.

39:45.700 --> 39:48.000
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just... I'm full, that's all.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.600
Calm before the storm. Get him near
those crap tables and look out.

39:51.700 --> 39:55.500
Jesus, I'm stuffed. I can't remember
the last time I ate this much.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.300
Sure youse don't
want no dessert?

39:57.335 --> 40:00.500
- Not for me.
- I'm good.

40:00.535 --> 40:02.600
Thank you.

40:02.700 --> 40:05.600
- Thanks.
- Enjoy it, girls.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.800
I been enjoying looking
at youse the whole night.

40:09.700 --> 40:12.800
- Get some fucking glasses.
- We gotta go.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.100
All right, I'll see you over
at the $100 table.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.900
- Yeah.
- Right.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.200
Ton', you sure you're all right?
You got a big moose on.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.200
It's a fucking broad,
believe that?

40:34.235 --> 40:36.500
Really?
You mean...?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.700
- It's the real deal, I think.
- No shit, huh?

40:39.900 --> 40:42.400
See? The thing is,

40:42.500 --> 40:45.100
we got this
platonic thing going.

40:45.135 --> 40:46.865
We have had
for many years.

40:46.900 --> 40:50.165
She thinks that's what it is,
but it's not,

40:50.200 --> 40:53.100
and no amount of convincing
will change her mind.

40:54.900 --> 40:59.400
- So she was a... friend.
- Yeah.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.300
They're wrapping up a lobster roll
for me to take to Ginny.

41:04.335 --> 41:06.000
- We'll see you's over there.
- Yeah.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.000
- Anything else, gentlemen?
- We're good.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.800
My friend here'll
take the check, though.

41:15.900 --> 41:17.900
Have a wonderful evening.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.700
# Let's get it on #

41:23.900 --> 41:25.965
1184.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.865
Oh... babe.

41:27.900 --> 41:30.600
I gotta play that number.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.600
Hmm, I'm gonna go wash up.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.600
# We're all
sensitive people #

41:35.700 --> 41:40.300
# With so much
love to give. #

41:40.400 --> 41:42.750
I'll tell you,
after a meal like that,

41:42.785 --> 41:45.100
what I could use is
a nice piece of ass.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.700
Who knows,
maybe I'll call down,

41:46.800 --> 41:48.300
have them send
one up to the room.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.100
Why don't you just fuck yourself?
Save a little money.

41:51.135 --> 41:53.465
- What's your problem?!
- Stop trying to bait me.

41:53.500 --> 41:56.600
- You know what my fucking problem is!
- No, why don't you tell me?

41:56.635 --> 42:00.017
You want me to tell you? Fine!
Steaks, 3 Ib. -lobsters,

42:00.052 --> 42:03.400
the shrimp fucking cocktails
you made everybody get.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.800
Then on top of everything else, you send
those skanks a bottle of Cristal?

42:06.835 --> 42:09.565
I was being a gentleman.
You oughtta try it some time.

42:09.600 --> 42:13.400
Not to mention the Lyonnaise fucking
potatoes you didn't even touch.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.100
- What?! I lost my appetite.
- Fuck you!

42:16.135 --> 42:18.700
- Excuse me?
- You fucking heard me!

42:18.800 --> 42:22.100
I'm telling you, I don't give a fuck
anymore who you're related to.

42:22.135 --> 42:23.700
Go ahead, Paulie.
Go for it.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.365
Your big fucking moment.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.000
- You little fuck...
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

42:29.100 --> 42:30.865
Was there a problem
with the service?

42:30.900 --> 42:34.200
- What are you talking about?
- You left me $16, sir.

42:34.235 --> 42:37.500
- Perhaps you miscounted.
- There's 1200 bucks in there.

42:37.535 --> 42:41.400
That's correct,
and the bill was $1184.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.900
Assuming you don't tip
on tax or alcohol, 15%...

42:43.935 --> 42:46.465
I'm tapped out.

42:46.500 --> 42:49.150
You think this job is easy?
I have kids.

42:49.185 --> 42:51.765
Then go back inside
before you get hurt.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.900
- I have a goddamn family to support.
- Fuck off.

42:54.935 --> 42:58.400
Yeah, right.
Go piss it away at blackjack,

42:58.500 --> 43:01.500
- fucking assholes!
- Oh!

43:04.900 --> 43:07.600
What do you
gotta say now?

43:12.400 --> 43:14.465
Chrissie, he's fucked up.

43:14.500 --> 43:18.700
Don't they have medicine they're
supposed to take, these assholes?

43:18.800 --> 43:20.600
I don't know.

43:20.700 --> 43:23.000
He'll say we hit him
with a brick.

43:23.035 --> 43:25.300
He's still going,
this asshole.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.600
That's my money,
Paulie!

44:05.700 --> 44:07.800
How's he doing?

44:07.900 --> 44:10.600
I love him so much
and I can't do shit.

44:14.500 --> 44:17.100
We're all praying
for him.

44:21.700 --> 44:24.700
You know, you were
another son to him.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.600
- Yeah?
- You get some sleep?

44:38.635 --> 44:40.700
Yeah, a little,
you know.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.600
- Fucked up, huh?
- What are you gonna do?

44:43.700 --> 44:45.900
I'm not too worried
about the cops.

44:45.935 --> 44:47.300
Nobody knows us down there.

44:48.600 --> 44:50.400
The reason I called.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.600
Let's bury the hatchet,
you and me.

44:52.700 --> 44:54.300
All this bullshit
with us.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.850
I know, I know,
it's stupid.

44:55.885 --> 44:57.300
Life's too short,
Chrissie.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.100
You can't waste it
fighting with your friends.

45:00.135 --> 45:02.200
Look what could've
happened last night.

45:02.300 --> 45:05.300
One of us could've got hurt
or even killed for Christ's sake.

45:05.335 --> 45:08.100
- I know.
- You're special to me, you know.

45:08.200 --> 45:12.100
- Always have been.
- You, too, Paulie... to me.

45:12.135 --> 45:14.900
We'll split the tab.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.300
I'm sorry, Paulie.

45:17.335 --> 45:19.600
I apologize too, kid.

45:19.700 --> 45:21.400
I'll talk to you later.

45:30.900 --> 45:34.400
When you say that,
you make me feel...

45:34.435 --> 45:36.700
less than.

45:40.300 --> 45:42.300
Next week, everyone.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.100
Good luck.

45:55.900 --> 45:58.500
- I'm going outta town next week.
- Okay.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.600
Good night.

46:07.700 --> 46:10.200
Anthony.

46:11.900 --> 46:14.500
- Hello.
- Hey.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.000
A friend of mine
had these.

46:19.700 --> 46:21.800
I'll see you
next week.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.800
Like I was saying, a friend of mine
had these and couldn't use them.

46:29.900 --> 46:31.800
I figured, well...

46:31.900 --> 46:33.900
maybe we could.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.800
Tickets, Bermuda, lodging
at the Elbow Beach Hotel.

46:41.000 --> 46:44.000
I turned down a wonderful
dinner invitation,

46:44.035 --> 46:46.300
and you think
I'll go away with you?

46:46.400 --> 46:49.100
Well, the guy couldn't
use them and...

46:49.200 --> 46:53.000
you know, he gave them to me. What do
you want me to do, throw them away?

46:55.200 --> 46:58.700
Come on, I'm breaking
out the big guns here.

46:58.735 --> 47:01.200
You're turning me
into half a stalker.

47:04.600 --> 47:06.965
Listen, Anthony, I'm...

47:07.000 --> 47:09.700
I'm not going to
go out with you, okay?

47:09.735 --> 47:12.400
And it's not because
you're unattractive

47:12.500 --> 47:14.650
or I don't think I
would have a good time,

47:14.685 --> 47:17.492
it's just something
I'm not going to do.

47:17.527 --> 47:20.265
And I would like you
to respect my decision,

47:20.300 --> 47:24.000
and just try to feel that
I know what's right for me.

47:26.500 --> 47:28.600
Okay?

47:36.900 --> 47:38.865
But it's not
just the...

47:38.900 --> 47:42.300
psychiatric ethics
stuff, is it?

47:42.400 --> 47:45.365
I wanna preserve
the option for you

47:45.400 --> 47:47.600
that you could always
come back to our work,

47:47.635 --> 47:49.265
if you wish.

47:49.300 --> 47:52.000
And that we could pick up
where we've left off.

47:52.035 --> 47:54.200
I don't think you
get this, I want you!

47:54.300 --> 47:56.400
And that's very
flattering to me.

47:56.435 --> 47:58.465
I'm not interested
in flattering you.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.700
- I know you're not.
- All right, then what is it?

48:00.735 --> 48:03.467
Okay, what is it?
Just...

48:03.502 --> 48:06.200
help me
understand it, okay?

48:10.300 --> 48:14.000
You know, Anthony,
during therapy I...

48:14.100 --> 48:17.200
I never judged you
or your behavior.

48:17.300 --> 48:19.900
It's not the place
of a therapist to do so.

48:19.935 --> 48:21.900
All right,
I get all this. Go, go.

48:23.300 --> 48:25.300
In a personal relationship,

48:25.400 --> 48:28.600
I don't think
I could sit silent.

48:29.600 --> 48:31.700
About what?

48:33.600 --> 48:35.665
Our values are...

48:35.700 --> 48:39.400
- just very different.
- You don't like my values?

48:39.500 --> 48:41.500
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

48:43.300 --> 48:45.800
No.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.765
Okay. Like what?

48:51.800 --> 48:55.000
- It's getting late, I...
- No, no, no. Come on.

48:55.100 --> 48:57.100
It's okay, it's okay.

49:00.900 --> 49:03.300
Well...

49:03.400 --> 49:06.600
you're not
a truthful person.

49:06.700 --> 49:08.865
You're not
respectful of women.

49:08.900 --> 49:10.865
You're not really
respectful of people.

49:10.900 --> 49:14.000
- I don't love people?
- Maybe you love them, I don't know.

49:14.035 --> 49:16.665
You take what you want
from them by force

49:16.700 --> 49:20.400
or the threat of force.
I couldn't live like that.

49:20.435 --> 49:24.100
- I couldn't bear witness to violence...
- Fuck you!

49:28.100 --> 49:30.100
You're a fucking cunt!

49:48.700 --> 49:50.300
Oh.

49:56.300 --> 49:58.200
How come Benny's
not outside?

49:58.300 --> 50:00.400
He just got here,
he's going out.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Where is he?

50:04.100 --> 50:07.100
He's in your office on the phone
with his girlfriend.

50:10.400 --> 50:12.700
Hey, Ton',
how's it going?

50:14.200 --> 50:17.065
You can take the night off.
I'll spell you.

50:17.100 --> 50:19.700
No, no, no, Ton',
that's all right, it's okay, really.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.700
I'll take over,
okay, for tonight.

50:21.735 --> 50:24.067
Okay, well...
night, Mrs. S.

50:24.102 --> 50:26.400
Good night, Benny,
thank you.

51:31.800 --> 51:35.500
- You want coffee?
- No.

51:55.200 --> 51:58.765
# I'm gonna turn
and walk away #

51:58.800 --> 52:01.900
# There's nothing left
for me to say #

52:01.935 --> 52:05.000
# It wouldn't
change things anyway #

52:05.100 --> 52:08.765
# Oh, I suppose #

52:08.800 --> 52:12.200
# The love I gave
was always true #

52:12.235 --> 52:15.417
# Well, I don't know
what else to do #

52:15.452 --> 52:18.600
# And how I'll
ever get over you #

52:18.635 --> 52:22.300
# Heaven only knows #

52:22.400 --> 52:25.750
# Heaven only
knows just why #

52:25.785 --> 52:28.892
# Loving you
should make me cry #

52:28.927 --> 52:32.000
# Make me feel
like I could die #

52:32.100 --> 52:35.800
# That's the way it goes #

52:35.900 --> 52:38.665
# Heaven only ever sees #

52:38.700 --> 52:42.465
# How love's
made a fool of me #

52:42.500 --> 52:44.900
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

52:45.000 --> 52:49.300
# But heaven only knows #

52:54.400 --> 52:57.600
# Heaven only knows
just why #

52:57.635 --> 53:00.800
# Loving you
should make me cry #

53:00.900 --> 53:04.350
# Make me feel
like I could die #

53:04.385 --> 53:07.800
# But that's
the way it goes #

53:07.835 --> 53:10.665
# Heaven only ever sees #

53:10.700 --> 53:14.465
# How love's
made a fool of me #

53:14.500 --> 53:17.400
# I guess that's how
it's meant to be #

53:17.500 --> 53:21.300
# But heaven only knows. #
