[rock music playing on radio]

01:18.539 --> 01:21.417
That shit is disgusting, man.
I don't know how you drink it.

01:21.501 --> 01:23.628
[Luschek chuckles] Yum.

01:23.711 --> 01:26.589
If I could tell five-year-old me
that one day he'd be able to get drunk

01:26.672 --> 01:29.884
off the liquid equivalent
of Werther's Originals for $5.98 a bottle,

01:29.967 --> 01:32.845
he'd be fucking psyched.

01:32.928 --> 01:34.514
[laughs]

01:34.597 --> 01:37.099
Or, actually, really confused
about what drunk means.

01:37.183 --> 01:38.768
[scoffs] Lucky you.

01:38.851 --> 01:41.687
Five-year-old me knew
exactly what being drunk meant.

01:46.776 --> 01:50.070
-Want a nibble?
-Nah, man. I-- I gotta work.

01:50.155 --> 01:51.614
So?

01:51.697 --> 01:53.658
Ah, my manager's up my ass, you know?

01:53.741 --> 01:55.326
He's gonna know I'm high
the second he sees me.

01:55.410 --> 01:56.786
You didn't listen to me, man.

01:56.869 --> 01:59.622
I told you, you gotta show up high
on your first day, man.

01:59.705 --> 02:01.582
That way they think
that's who you are.

02:01.666 --> 02:03.626
[mockingly] But no, you had to go
and make a good impression,

02:03.709 --> 02:05.253
get off on the right foot.

02:05.336 --> 02:06.671
Now, you're screwed.

02:09.215 --> 02:11.259
[garbled] Can't let other people
define you, man.

02:12.218 --> 02:13.969
When are you getting
the boot off your truck?

02:15.346 --> 02:17.182
After I get my bike out of impound.

02:20.100 --> 02:22.019
[sniffs] Thanks for the ride.

02:22.102 --> 02:24.147
[woman talking indistinctly on PA]

02:27.733 --> 02:28.901
Boom!

02:34.574 --> 02:36.826
Mmm! Hey, um, Joel?

02:38.244 --> 02:39.912
-Me?
-Sorry, did I get that wrong?

02:39.995 --> 02:41.164
I thought it was Joel.

02:41.247 --> 02:44.167
I saw it on your mailbox,
uh, which is overflowing.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.753
I just think you might wanna
take care of that before Piscatella sees.

02:47.837 --> 02:51.090
[mimicking Piscatella]
Keep things orderly and in order!

02:54.760 --> 02:57.597
-Uh, what's your, uh, first name?
-Baxter.

02:57.680 --> 03:01.934
[giggles] Your parents
named you Baxter Bayley?

03:02.017 --> 03:03.644
That sounds like a cartoon dog name.

03:03.728 --> 03:06.481
My dad's really into dogs,
actually, so...

03:07.106 --> 03:08.190
Uh, it's weird.

03:08.274 --> 03:11.694
-Yeah.
-Here's the thing, Baxter Bayley, uh...

03:11.777 --> 03:14.614
I don't really like to pay too much
attention to anything around here,

03:14.697 --> 03:18.200
especially if it requires me
to do something as a result.

03:18.284 --> 03:20.661
So, uh, if you're gonna
point something out to me,

03:20.745 --> 03:24.499
it should be something awesome,
like cake or pie in the break room.

03:24.582 --> 03:27.167
Yeah. Got it, Joel.

03:27.252 --> 03:29.379
Uh... it's, uh... Luschek.

03:29.462 --> 03:31.171
Sorry.

03:31.256 --> 03:34.925
Look, I just... I really think
you need to deal with your letters.

03:38.971 --> 03:41.474
-What the hell?
-Told you.

04:09.627 --> 04:11.086
[gulps] Oh!

04:12.630 --> 04:14.131
"Caputo's dingleberries"?

04:14.214 --> 04:15.341
I gotta go.

04:16.301 --> 04:18.886
Hmm? Okay.

04:18.969 --> 04:21.971
Well, I will let you know
if I see cake or pie.

04:22.055 --> 04:24.642
[chuckles] Great.

04:25.518 --> 04:27.270
-Thanks.
-Have fun.

04:27.353 --> 04:29.355
[indistinct chatter]

04:29.439 --> 04:32.066
Oh, hey, morning, sugar.

04:32.149 --> 04:33.734
-[chuckles]
-Inmate. [sighs]

04:33.818 --> 04:36.111
[sniffs] Do I smell butterscotch?

04:36.195 --> 04:38.281
[gasps] Ah.

04:38.364 --> 04:40.325
Do I look like my 92-year-old nana?

04:40.408 --> 04:42.785
Ooh, boy. Somebody's
in a mood this morning.

04:42.868 --> 04:44.370
So, what have you got there?

04:45.455 --> 04:47.122
-Fan mail.
-Ah! Oh, wait.

04:47.206 --> 04:48.583
All right, little advice.

04:48.666 --> 04:50.501
You wanna get yourself
a signature stamp,

04:50.585 --> 04:51.627
save you hours.

04:51.711 --> 04:53.588
Aren't you full of time-saving tips?

04:53.671 --> 04:56.591
Mmm. So, you got yourself
an overzealous pen pal?

04:57.842 --> 05:00.135
Uh... former inmate here.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.805
And I thought I was special.

05:04.264 --> 05:05.975
Wasn't like that.

05:06.058 --> 05:07.893
[cell door slams]

05:07.977 --> 05:10.521
[Karen] That must've taken
a lot of courage.

05:10.605 --> 05:14.149
Remember, you have
a community that serves you.

05:14.233 --> 05:16.486
Thank you for your honesty today.

05:16.569 --> 05:18.821
[inmates applauding]

05:18.904 --> 05:21.031
Now, before
I distribute today's chips,

05:21.115 --> 05:23.242
join me in the Serenity Prayer.

05:24.201 --> 05:29.374
[all] God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

05:29.457 --> 05:32.627
the courage to change
the things I can,

05:32.710 --> 05:35.880
and the wisdom to know the difference.

05:35.963 --> 05:37.006
Okay.

05:37.923 --> 05:41.260
So it looks like I only have
one chip to celebrate today,

05:41.343 --> 05:42.470
and it's a goody.

05:43.095 --> 05:44.514
Nichols.

05:45.515 --> 05:46.932
Care to come up here?

05:47.016 --> 05:48.267
[chuckles softly]

05:51.061 --> 05:53.981
-Three years. Well done.
-[softly] Thank you.

05:54.064 --> 05:56.108
[inmates applauding]

05:57.735 --> 06:00.988
[chuckling] Hey! Well, shit, man,

06:01.071 --> 06:03.533
if I knew you guys were gonna clap,
I would've brought my tap shoes.

06:03.616 --> 06:05.034
[all chuckle]

06:05.117 --> 06:06.118
Uh, you know, to be honest,

06:06.201 --> 06:07.953
I never really believed in this bullshit
before, you know?

06:08.037 --> 06:09.997
I'd go to rehab
and no one told me

06:10.080 --> 06:11.666
that you guys give it away
for free in here.

06:11.749 --> 06:14.126
I should've just gotten locked up,
like, a decade ago,

06:14.209 --> 06:16.086
saved my mom a suitcase of cash.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.713
[all chuckle]

06:17.797 --> 06:19.298
Although, I do miss the cigarettes.

06:19.381 --> 06:20.800
-[inmates murmuring]
-[inmate 1] Aw.

06:20.883 --> 06:23.886
-Really miss the cigarettes.
-[inmate 2] Damn.

06:23.969 --> 06:28.641
Hey... and like, how the fuck
do you have AA with no smokes?

06:28.724 --> 06:30.142
-[inmates chuckling]
-It's nuts.

06:30.225 --> 06:32.687
And it's criminal.
You know, so to speak.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.313
Anyway... [sighs]

06:35.481 --> 06:36.732
[sighs]

06:37.942 --> 06:41.403
This valueless piece of crappy plastic
really means a lot to me.

06:42.404 --> 06:44.114
Uh...

06:44.198 --> 06:47.117
symbolism, et cetera.

06:49.161 --> 06:51.581
Well, screw it, you know,
I'm fucking proud of myself, so...

06:51.664 --> 06:53.290
[inmates applauding]

06:54.249 --> 06:57.462
[Karen] All right, everyone.
So, I'll see you tomorrow.

06:57.545 --> 06:58.588
Keep coming back.

06:58.671 --> 07:02.132
[all] It works if you work it.

07:02.216 --> 07:03.342
[Karen] Okay.

07:15.605 --> 07:17.690
-You fucking kidding me?
-Contraband.

07:20.901 --> 07:22.402
Shit.

07:22.487 --> 07:23.613
[panting]

07:24.530 --> 07:25.823
[Sankey] Morning, sister.

07:28.618 --> 07:31.829
Sorry, I, uh...
I have a thing...

07:33.163 --> 07:34.206
over here.

07:37.543 --> 07:39.462
[panting]

07:53.476 --> 07:55.394
I would've asked,
but since we're sneaking

07:55.478 --> 07:57.312
into each other's bunks
in the middle of the night,

07:57.396 --> 07:59.857
I thought it was... safe to assume.

08:00.733 --> 08:02.568
I was sleepwalking.

08:02.652 --> 08:05.404
Climbing... whispering.

08:06.446 --> 08:09.324
-What's going on with you?
-Nothing. I'm great. [scoffs]

08:09.408 --> 08:13.245
I'm just sitting here...

08:13.328 --> 08:15.414
enjoying the prison breeze.

08:15.498 --> 08:17.291
I'm worried about you.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.044
The other night
was really out of character.

08:20.127 --> 08:22.630
Maybe it's entirely in character,
but you wouldn't know

08:22.713 --> 08:23.798
because we haven't
talked in so long.

08:23.881 --> 08:24.924
Fine.

08:25.883 --> 08:27.092
I will leave you alone.

08:28.052 --> 08:29.136
[Alex sighs]

08:29.219 --> 08:32.139
But I'm here if you ever wanna
drop the sarcasm and talk to me.

08:32.222 --> 08:33.599
Oh, my God.

08:33.683 --> 08:34.683
How generous!

08:35.851 --> 08:38.688
Now you have time for me?
Now you wanna talk?

08:39.354 --> 08:42.107
Where were you before?
When I needed you?

08:43.150 --> 08:45.235
I begged you to listen to me,

08:45.319 --> 08:47.237
and you were too busy
fucking that tattooed kangaroo

08:47.321 --> 08:48.656
and calling me paranoid.

08:48.739 --> 08:52.868
I spent months thinking that
I was crazy because of you!

08:52.952 --> 08:54.411
And you know what?
I was right.

08:54.494 --> 08:57.122
Right? What do you mean,
you were right?

08:58.833 --> 09:01.711
Nothing. Never mind.
I have to go.

09:02.753 --> 09:03.879
[sighs]

09:04.839 --> 09:06.173
[inmates laughing]

09:06.256 --> 09:10.595
Most likely to be
an undercover baller goes to...

09:11.846 --> 09:13.388
-Maritza.
-[squeals]

09:13.472 --> 09:15.140
-[cheering]
-[laughing]

09:15.224 --> 09:16.726
[Maria clapping]

09:16.809 --> 09:19.937
I have dreamt about this moment
my whole life.

09:20.020 --> 09:21.772
-[inmates chuckling]
-No, but for real, though,

09:21.856 --> 09:23.816
that was, like,
some James Bond-level shit.

09:23.899 --> 09:26.819
-Ooh!
-Panty Galore. Hi.

09:26.902 --> 09:28.988
[laughing]

09:29.071 --> 09:30.656
No, but seriously,
when do we get paid?

09:30.740 --> 09:32.992
Alonso's gonna let me know
when all the inventory's sold.

09:33.075 --> 09:35.285
[scoffs] Yo, this is a real shame.

09:35.369 --> 09:37.162
-Hmm?
-[Ouija] We got a group here, right?

09:37.246 --> 09:38.956
We got a system. So...

09:39.039 --> 09:41.083
Oh, why we ain't going
after the hard stuff?

09:41.166 --> 09:43.919
That's true. How much
we ever gonna make off panties?

09:44.003 --> 09:46.005
Yo, we gotta be patient, all right?

09:46.088 --> 09:49.216
Our crew ain't about
nothing illegal, you hear me?

09:49.299 --> 09:50.550
-This is the game in here right now.
-Why?

09:50.635 --> 09:52.762
So we're gonna play the game
and we're gonna win.

09:54.221 --> 09:56.431
On behalf of
the Litchfield Safety Task Force,

09:56.515 --> 09:57.975
you need to halt your gathering.

09:58.058 --> 09:59.685
What the fuck you saying?

09:59.769 --> 10:01.145
Congress...

10:01.228 --> 10:02.772
[stammers] Shit. No, that's not it.

10:02.855 --> 10:04.732
-Um, conga--
-[inmates snickering]

10:04.815 --> 10:07.860
-Ca-- Conga. Conga. This shit?
-[inmates chuckling]

10:08.611 --> 10:10.738
"Congregating."
It's "congregating."

10:10.821 --> 10:13.783
-Yeah. Congregating...
-[Maria chuckling]

10:13.866 --> 10:17.494
...in a group of four or more
is no longer allowed.

10:17.577 --> 10:18.704
-[scoffs] What?
-[chuckles]

10:18.788 --> 10:22.207
-Man, get the fuck outta here. Stupid.
-[Maria laughing] So stupid.

10:22.291 --> 10:23.542
Look, you dirt taco.

10:23.626 --> 10:24.710
[inmates] Whoa!

10:24.794 --> 10:27.672
You move along or I'll call a CO over here
and get y'all some shots.

10:27.755 --> 10:28.798
What'd you just call her?

10:28.881 --> 10:31.842
-What's the problem?
-They're gathering, sir.

10:31.926 --> 10:34.386
Oh, gathering, huh?

10:34.469 --> 10:36.096
Well, I guess that's some shots.

10:36.180 --> 10:38.182
-[Pidge] What?
-Oh! Are you serious, man?

10:38.265 --> 10:39.892
-[Dixon] Yeah.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

10:39.975 --> 10:41.101
Really?

10:41.185 --> 10:42.436
[typing]

10:45.439 --> 10:47.482
It's like he's in my head.

10:47.566 --> 10:50.319
-It's like he's talking right to me.
-That's good.

10:51.361 --> 10:52.362
[sighs]

10:54.990 --> 10:56.366
Can I pitch you a crazy idea?

10:57.076 --> 10:59.161
You wanna make me breakfast.

10:59.244 --> 11:00.454
That is very sweet. [chuckles]

11:00.537 --> 11:03.165
Stick with me for just a second.

11:03.248 --> 11:05.710
We have all these issues
because of the overcrowding, right?

11:05.793 --> 11:08.337
We have lack of space,
unemployment, bad behavior,

11:08.420 --> 11:11.506
but you know what I think
the biggest problem we have is?

11:11.590 --> 11:12.717
My hunger?

11:12.800 --> 11:14.051
Boredom.

11:14.134 --> 11:15.469
The inmates are restless.

11:15.552 --> 11:17.387
They have nothing
to fill up their time, so they're...

11:17.471 --> 11:18.973
they're picking fights
and they're acting out,

11:19.056 --> 11:20.224
and you can't really blame 'em,

11:20.307 --> 11:22.392
and we don't have the money
to give them jobs,

11:22.476 --> 11:24.394
but we can give 'em something else.

11:24.478 --> 11:26.688
Something that gives them a reason to...

11:26.772 --> 11:28.357
to get dressed in the morning.

11:29.358 --> 11:31.777
That makes them
more productive members of society,

11:31.861 --> 11:33.112
in and out of prison.

11:34.613 --> 11:35.781
[sighs]

11:36.531 --> 11:38.492
We can give 'em classes.

11:40.786 --> 11:41.912
That sounds expensive.

11:41.996 --> 11:43.663
But it wouldn't have to be.

11:43.748 --> 11:45.582
MCC would never let one of those

11:45.665 --> 11:47.584
fruity liberal arts schools
inside our walls.

11:47.667 --> 11:48.794
I know that.
That's why I was thinking

11:48.878 --> 11:50.545
we can train the guards
to lead the classes.

11:50.629 --> 11:52.006
We don't have to teach calculus,

11:52.089 --> 11:55.259
just some more concrete life skills.

11:55.926 --> 11:57.594
We can call them...

11:57.677 --> 11:58.971
enrichment classes.

11:59.889 --> 12:02.850
This can make a real difference
in some of these women's lives.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.643
And maybe ours, too.

12:04.726 --> 12:07.062
If I can get this off the ground...

12:07.729 --> 12:10.524
it has the potential
to be career-defining.

12:11.483 --> 12:12.484
Right?

12:13.861 --> 12:14.904
I can help.

12:15.737 --> 12:16.989
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:17.072 --> 12:18.908
I know how to pitch things to MCC.

12:18.991 --> 12:21.660
It's all about using
the right language with them,

12:21.743 --> 12:23.037
putting things in their terms.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.288
When I'm in my flow,
they don't even realize

12:24.371 --> 12:25.414
what they're saying yes to.

12:25.497 --> 12:26.832
You think that's the right approach?

12:26.916 --> 12:29.084
Absolutely. You let me handle them.

12:29.168 --> 12:32.712
You focus on your legacy.
Go, team.

12:32.797 --> 12:34.589
-[both chuckling]
-Go, team!

12:34.673 --> 12:36.050
[chuckles] And go omelet, maybe?

12:36.133 --> 12:37.176
Like, a scramble?

12:37.259 --> 12:39.136
-Scramble? You're hungry?
-Love a scramble.

12:39.219 --> 12:40.762
-[laughing] I'm hungry. I'm starving.
-You need to eat.

12:40.846 --> 12:42.597
This is good, Joe.
This is so good.

12:42.681 --> 12:45.309
-I'm gonna make you an omelet.
-Great. Go, team!

12:46.018 --> 12:48.395
This week we seen
two sets of titties on the walls,

12:48.478 --> 12:50.815
which is less than
four the week before,

12:50.898 --> 12:53.108
and only one pussy.

12:53.192 --> 12:55.360
Uh, but to be honest,
it wasn't really drawed that well,

12:55.444 --> 12:57.988
so I don't think anybody knew
it was supposed to be a pussy, anyway.

12:58.072 --> 13:00.615
Yeah, chalking that up
as a win all around.

13:00.699 --> 13:02.367
Been breaking up groups
of border niggers

13:02.451 --> 13:03.618
and plain niggers, too.

13:03.702 --> 13:07.206
Spooking spooks.
Crunching nachos. Ain't nothing.

13:08.123 --> 13:09.249
[hands slap]

13:09.333 --> 13:12.377
This has been moderately
to minimally helpful.

13:12.461 --> 13:13.587
Thank you, inmates.

13:13.670 --> 13:14.922
[Sankey] Wait, we got more.

13:15.464 --> 13:18.008
Some of us girls
have also been noticing panties.

13:19.093 --> 13:23.055
[laughs] Why don't you just, uh,
leave the strip-searching up to us?

13:23.138 --> 13:26.058
Not the regular panties.
The fancy ones from the sewing job.

13:26.141 --> 13:27.434
Slutty panties.

13:27.517 --> 13:28.768
Well, I think they're pretty.

13:28.853 --> 13:31.355
Shouldn't we be focusing
on gang activity?

13:31.438 --> 13:34.358
Girls wearing panties
sounds pretty harmless to me.

13:34.441 --> 13:35.650
For perverts.

13:35.734 --> 13:39.238
-Cash money. Crotch sniffing.
-Yeah.

13:39.321 --> 13:41.866
It's a business. We heard.

13:41.949 --> 13:45.369
You're telling me that somebody's
making money off of dirty panties?

13:45.452 --> 13:50.582
Yeah, they're selling for, like,
$700 to Chinamen in China.

13:50.665 --> 13:52.042
That's what we heard.

13:52.126 --> 13:53.377
[Angie] Oh, we heard that. Yeah.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.463
[Dixon] Thank you for your intel.

13:56.546 --> 13:57.839
[inmate 1] Keep it steady.

13:59.216 --> 14:00.968
[whirs]

14:01.051 --> 14:02.552
[inmate 2] All right, I got it.

14:03.803 --> 14:05.555
[drill whirring]

14:05.639 --> 14:07.307
[Coates] Yeah, see, if you wanted
to be the United States,

14:07.391 --> 14:09.476
you should've been the women,
because they're good at soccer.

14:09.559 --> 14:11.270
Whereas the men,
not so much.

14:11.353 --> 14:13.480
I'm not gonna be
some chick team, dude.

14:13.563 --> 14:16.441
-Oh, damn it!
-[Coates] Yeah, that's offsides.

14:16.525 --> 14:18.360
[drilling]

14:18.443 --> 14:21.280
I can't concentrate with all the noise
from the idiots out there.

14:21.363 --> 14:22.865
You want a soda?

14:22.948 --> 14:25.617
-Anything harder?
-Aren't you on the clock?

14:25.700 --> 14:27.452
[mockingly imitates Coates]
"Aren't you on the clock?"

14:27.536 --> 14:29.413
-[hammering]
-[inmates exclaiming]

14:29.496 --> 14:32.041
Maybe I should just call
the cable company instead.

14:32.124 --> 14:33.708
-If you wanna pay for it, sure.
-[inmate exclaiming]

14:34.626 --> 14:38.422
Teaching them to install illegal cable
doesn't exactly sound like rehabilitation.

14:38.505 --> 14:40.132
-[inmates clamoring]
-[Luschek sighs]

14:40.215 --> 14:42.759
Hey, it's a practical skill
in the real world, my friend.

14:43.468 --> 14:44.594
I'm bleeding.

14:44.678 --> 14:46.096
-What the fuck did you do?
-Jesus.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.558
I cut myself with that shitty,
rusty wire cutter you gave us.

14:49.641 --> 14:51.685
-Come on, run.
-What? No, I need to go to medical!

14:51.768 --> 14:53.437
At halftime, just...

14:53.520 --> 14:55.230
-wrap a sock around it or something.
-[Gina scoffs]

14:55.314 --> 14:56.773
One more scar's
not gonna change your world.

14:56.856 --> 14:59.651
-[exclaims] Fucking asshole.
-[cheering on TV]

14:59.734 --> 15:02.612
Oh, goal! Take that, fucker!

15:02.696 --> 15:04.156
I wasn't even playing, man.

15:04.239 --> 15:06.075
You're such a piece of shit.

15:06.158 --> 15:07.367
What did you say, inmate?

15:08.243 --> 15:10.704
I said, you're a piece of shit!

15:10.787 --> 15:13.540
-You wanna spend some time in the SHU?
-Hey, man, she needs to go to medical.

15:13.623 --> 15:16.001
-Are you defending her?
-If she's telling you she needs something,

15:16.085 --> 15:17.294
you need to listen to her.

15:17.377 --> 15:19.171
They're people, for Christ's sake.

15:19.254 --> 15:21.256
It's our job to take care
of these women.

15:21.340 --> 15:24.634
Do your fucking job!
You're not listening to her.

15:25.177 --> 15:26.261
Are you joking?

15:28.430 --> 15:29.639
Get out of my house.

15:30.640 --> 15:32.851
No? Not joking?

15:33.643 --> 15:35.020
It's been a real buzzkill.

15:35.104 --> 15:36.438
[inhales sharply]

15:37.314 --> 15:38.523
Let's go, tetanus.

15:39.733 --> 15:41.610
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

15:41.693 --> 15:43.237
[Gina] What?

15:43.320 --> 15:44.529
Can you give us a ride?

15:46.365 --> 15:47.366
[sighs]

15:56.208 --> 15:57.417
[birds chirping]

15:59.669 --> 16:02.214
-[clattering]
-[hinges squeaking]

16:02.297 --> 16:04.841
[male CO] Hey, get a move on, inmate.

16:12.057 --> 16:14.018
-[indistinct conversations]
-[cell doors slam]

16:20.482 --> 16:21.483
What's your business?

16:21.566 --> 16:23.360
Well, I figured I'd bust out of here

16:23.443 --> 16:26.780
and sell generic disinfectant and
cleaning rags on the street for pennies.

16:28.490 --> 16:30.492
Man, come on. It's me.

16:30.575 --> 16:31.743
Answer the question.

16:32.619 --> 16:34.829
I am a cleaning porter,

16:34.913 --> 16:37.166
as my giant accomplice here
might indicate.

16:41.086 --> 16:43.047
Take a left down hallway A,

16:43.130 --> 16:45.382
a right down hallway 21...

16:46.383 --> 16:48.010
and then report to the SHU gate.

16:49.511 --> 16:50.679
Oh, hey, let me ask you a question.

16:50.762 --> 16:53.348
Uh, at what point
do I get to meet the wizard?

16:58.228 --> 16:59.813
Oh, thank you.

17:00.605 --> 17:01.648
See ya.

17:01.731 --> 17:04.068
-[SHU inmates speaking indistinctly]
-[Nicky] Michigan, Lansing.

17:05.402 --> 17:07.487
Minnesota, Jackson.

17:08.696 --> 17:11.700
Missouri, Jefferson City.

17:11.782 --> 17:14.743
[Sophia] Mississippi.
You forgot Mississippi.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.123
Mississippi.

17:18.207 --> 17:19.374
God damn.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.044
I always do that.

17:27.132 --> 17:28.883
[SHU inmate] Shut that motherfucker!

17:30.177 --> 17:32.887
-What, you a Peeping Tom now?
-[clears throat]

17:38.602 --> 17:39.936
Hi, Burset.

17:40.854 --> 17:42.064
Be honest with me.

17:42.856 --> 17:44.816
Ever seen me
look this ravishing?

17:44.899 --> 17:46.526
Uh...

17:46.610 --> 17:51.115
if we're using "ravishing"
as a synonym for "horrendous," never.

17:51.865 --> 17:53.117
Nichols, right?

17:54.784 --> 17:56.578
You're on this hallway a lot?

17:56.661 --> 17:59.289
Maybe once a week.

17:59.373 --> 18:01.833
And I never really know
where they're gonna assign me.

18:01.916 --> 18:02.917
[softly] Listen.

18:04.086 --> 18:06.045
Can you get me a blanket?

18:06.130 --> 18:08.465
Bring it in next time you come through?

18:08.548 --> 18:11.760
[stammers] I'd love to help you,
I just, uh...

18:11.843 --> 18:13.678
I'm really trying to keep
on the straight and narrow.

18:13.762 --> 18:16.348
Please. I'm not sleeping.

18:17.266 --> 18:19.726
I'm gonna lose my mind
if I don't get some rest.

18:19.809 --> 18:23.105
And we both know what happens
if you go insane in this place, right?

18:23.188 --> 18:26.441
[sighs] Hey, uh, I feel you.
I really do.

18:26.525 --> 18:28.902
But think about it,
I don't even know where to find a spare.

18:28.985 --> 18:31.613
Even if I did,
they'd just spot it in a second.

18:31.696 --> 18:33.532
You'd be fucked.
I'd be fucked.

18:36.201 --> 18:38.036
I get it.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.371
Sorry I asked.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.500
[softly] Hold on.

18:49.714 --> 18:51.133
Here.

18:53.468 --> 18:55.345
At least that'll keep
your mind occupied.

18:55.429 --> 18:59.098
All right, so just go slowly, all right?

18:59.183 --> 19:02.477
Read every word,
even the ads. [chuckles]

19:03.853 --> 19:06.815
Reciting the capitals helps me
if that doesn't work.

19:07.524 --> 19:09.193
[chuckles]

19:09.276 --> 19:10.819
[cell door slams]

19:12.487 --> 19:15.324
-I gotta go. I gotta go. Okay.
-What's it like outside today?

19:15.407 --> 19:17.284
Is it raining?

19:20.454 --> 19:21.538
[Humphrey] Go.

19:21.621 --> 19:23.122
Whoa, Snow White and her high hoes.

19:23.207 --> 19:24.291
Why don't you get in
the back of the line?

19:24.374 --> 19:25.667
-[Humphrey] Next.
-What's going on?

19:25.750 --> 19:27.419
Oh, it's a stop-and-frisk.

19:27.502 --> 19:29.921
[Humphrey] Over here. Next.

19:31.923 --> 19:33.175
Over here.

19:33.258 --> 19:34.426
Thank you.

19:34.509 --> 19:35.510
-Next.
-Are you wearing?

19:35.594 --> 19:36.595
Mmm-hmm.

19:36.678 --> 19:38.263
-[Humphrey] Here.
-Fuck.

19:38.347 --> 19:39.598
[Humphrey] Next.

19:41.140 --> 19:42.434
Over here, please.

19:43.477 --> 19:45.479
Oh, yeah, hustle.

19:45.562 --> 19:46.855
Next.

19:51.193 --> 19:52.277
Right over here.

19:55.989 --> 19:57.115
Go.

19:58.742 --> 19:59.868
Next.

20:02.746 --> 20:03.872
Go.

20:05.332 --> 20:06.833
You.

20:06.916 --> 20:08.001
No.

20:09.002 --> 20:10.128
You.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.547
You look interesting.

20:13.965 --> 20:16.426
-Where are you from, inmate?
-Hawaii.

20:16.510 --> 20:17.802
Ooh.

20:18.845 --> 20:20.013
Well, over here.

20:22.307 --> 20:23.392
<i>Aloha.</i>

20:25.101 --> 20:28.146
-Next.
-Well, hello there, CO, sir.

20:28.230 --> 20:29.523
How are you today?

20:30.690 --> 20:31.691
Go.

20:33.192 --> 20:34.403
Come on.

20:38.657 --> 20:39.658
And next.

20:40.325 --> 20:41.493
[CO] Next.

20:44.288 --> 20:45.289
Shit.

20:54.756 --> 20:55.757
[CO] Next.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.841
[Taystee] <i>Look at this.</i>

20:59.052 --> 21:00.887
Oh, shit.
That's Betty Cracker herself.

21:00.970 --> 21:03.139
I was in that grass this morning.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.308
That exact grass.

21:04.391 --> 21:08.061
Damn. We could've been in this pic.
Been all prison famous.

21:08.144 --> 21:10.355
You know what's better than being famous?

21:10.439 --> 21:13.191
Uh... pizza, daisies, smelly markers,

21:13.275 --> 21:15.819
any animal, a really good dream,
a warm bath,

21:15.902 --> 21:17.487
-picking a booger, a dry one...
-Ugh!

21:17.571 --> 21:20.156
...pizza, graham crackers
and icing sandwiches,

21:20.239 --> 21:22.200
the feeling you get
when you make a really good joke

21:22.284 --> 21:25.704
and someone laughs, in a nice way,
not a mean way, and they--

21:25.787 --> 21:27.789
-Money!
-Money?

21:27.872 --> 21:30.375
-Cash money, y'all.
-[laughs]

21:30.459 --> 21:32.961
Yo, do you know how much
these paparazzi people make

21:33.044 --> 21:35.297
off of one of these celebrity pictures?

21:35.380 --> 21:37.549
If they be flying
these robocops over Litchfield

21:37.632 --> 21:40.760
just to get this janky-ass picture...

21:40.844 --> 21:44.973
imagine how much a close-up could be.

21:45.056 --> 21:46.808
That's what those drones are doing?

21:47.434 --> 21:49.143
The aliens aren't coming?

21:49.227 --> 21:50.604
Yo!

21:50.687 --> 21:52.731
Focus!

21:52.814 --> 21:54.649
-My bad. My bad.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:54.733 --> 21:56.318
I got the Internet.

21:58.111 --> 22:00.405
-Where?
-You got on Caputo's computer.

22:00.489 --> 22:03.199
Yo! That's a game changer!

22:03.282 --> 22:05.744
I know! I know, I know, I know!
Okay, okay, okay.

22:05.827 --> 22:08.955
So, all we got to do now
is find ourselves a cell phone,

22:09.038 --> 22:11.375
and we got ourselves a retirement plan.

22:11.458 --> 22:13.377
[Suzanne gasps] Yo...

22:13.460 --> 22:19.383
I'm gonna retire in that hotel
with the indoor water park in Ohio.

22:19.466 --> 22:21.217
Lord, give me strength.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.802
[Lolly] You got kids?

22:22.886 --> 22:24.471
[Healy] No.

22:24.554 --> 22:25.805
Wasn't in the cards.

22:26.723 --> 22:28.057
Didn't have the genetics.

22:28.141 --> 22:30.226
[chuckling]
Well, that don't stop most people.

22:30.309 --> 22:34.188
[chuckles] Well, there was some
family medical history

22:34.272 --> 22:35.565
I didn't wanna pass on.

22:36.858 --> 22:38.067
You?

22:38.151 --> 22:41.029
Well, the... Okay, the me
that I used to be wanted 'em...

22:41.112 --> 22:43.740
but considering my present situation...

22:43.823 --> 22:47.368
it's probably good that I didn't make
any more little Lolly-pops.

22:48.036 --> 22:49.663
Hey, have you ever seen <i>The Twilight Zone?</i>

22:49.746 --> 22:52.624
-Up here every day.
-[laughs]

22:52.707 --> 22:54.918
You know, my mother loved it.

22:55.001 --> 22:56.127
And there was an episode

22:56.210 --> 22:59.213
where this couple
wakes up in a strange house.

22:59.297 --> 23:01.382
So they go downstairs,
and they're looking for other people.

23:01.466 --> 23:02.967
They can't find any other people.

23:03.051 --> 23:05.136
They try to make a call,
and all the phones are fake.

23:05.219 --> 23:06.345
-No!
-Yes.

23:06.430 --> 23:08.014
[both laugh]

23:08.097 --> 23:10.308
And outside,
there are fake squirrels,

23:10.391 --> 23:14.646
stuffed... posed on fake trees.

23:15.439 --> 23:18.567
So, at the end...

23:18.650 --> 23:23.154
this really huge hand
reaches down from the sky

23:23.237 --> 23:24.781
and picks them up.

23:25.824 --> 23:27.867
And it's a young girl...

23:28.952 --> 23:30.119
but she's a giant...

23:30.745 --> 23:34.040
and the couple are stuck
in her play world,

23:34.123 --> 23:36.250
so she can make them do
whatever she wants.

23:37.293 --> 23:38.837
Whoa.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.129
My mother...

23:41.297 --> 23:43.675
was... like you.

23:45.635 --> 23:46.970
Similar issues.

23:48.304 --> 23:52.350
And she would always say...
that that's how it felt,

23:52.433 --> 23:56.480
like she was locked...
in a fake world...

23:56.563 --> 23:58.231
that no one else was part of...

23:59.398 --> 24:01.943
even though it looked exactly the same.

24:04.654 --> 24:06.823
Yeah, I got a lot of prisons
in my life, sir.

24:08.783 --> 24:10.284
I got the literal one, duh.

24:12.078 --> 24:16.541
I got the one where I'm on my meds
and I can't feel anything.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.543
That is not so great.

24:18.627 --> 24:20.128
Then, I have the worst one...

24:20.211 --> 24:23.464
the prison where I'm usually living in,

24:23.548 --> 24:25.049
and there's all these people, right,

24:25.133 --> 24:26.551
and they're talkin'
and talkin' and talkin'.

24:26.635 --> 24:28.344
And they cannot agree
on what is the truth.

24:28.427 --> 24:29.721
That's like that episode.

24:29.804 --> 24:31.097
That's exactly right.

24:33.349 --> 24:34.518
How's your mom?

24:35.143 --> 24:36.352
She's fine.

24:37.812 --> 24:39.105
I'm glad.

24:39.188 --> 24:40.314
Thank you.

24:46.530 --> 24:48.573
I need the dead man's keys.

24:48.657 --> 24:51.450
[scoffs] Warm a girl up a little,
would ya?

24:52.368 --> 24:55.329
I would very much like to return
your witty banter,

24:55.413 --> 24:58.207
but I am too exhausted to be clever.

24:58.291 --> 24:59.292
The keys.

24:59.375 --> 25:00.459
Now.

25:02.796 --> 25:04.255
[sighing]

25:08.342 --> 25:09.385
Are you all right?

25:09.468 --> 25:13.222
I haven't had
a decent night's sleep in weeks.

25:17.310 --> 25:20.063
Hoping to escape to the Motel 6
down the street?

25:20.146 --> 25:24.693
A more practical escape than that,
my friend. [clicks tongue]

25:24.776 --> 25:26.903
How the fuck are you not
freaking out right now?

25:26.986 --> 25:28.529
-About the panty raid?
-Yes.

25:29.072 --> 25:31.616
-You saw that stop-and-frisk today.
-Mmm-hmm.

25:31.700 --> 25:35.203
They're not even looking in our direction,
and they're never going to.

25:35.745 --> 25:37.163
We're good.

25:37.246 --> 25:40.834
I'm playing those guards like a flute.
Like a group of flutes, many flutes.

25:40.917 --> 25:41.960
I'm the flautist.

25:42.043 --> 25:44.337
Okay, I get it.
You play a mean flute.

25:44.420 --> 25:47.966
But tell me, what's gonna happen
when they stop one of the brown girls...

25:48.049 --> 25:49.383
who's wearing panties?

25:49.968 --> 25:51.886
You think she's gonna give up Maria?

25:51.970 --> 25:53.680
Fuck, no.
She's gonna point right at you,

25:53.763 --> 25:56.683
because... well, it's the truth,
so she won't be lying.

25:56.766 --> 25:59.185
[laughs] And also,
everyone hates you.

25:59.268 --> 26:01.520
If they are coming for me,
I will be here.

26:01.605 --> 26:03.648
That is precisely my point.

26:03.732 --> 26:06.860
You're just sitting, waiting.
Chapman, make a move. Be a shark.

26:06.943 --> 26:09.779
I am not tearing down
everything that I have built.

26:09.863 --> 26:12.531
This business is important to me.
It gives me purpose.

26:12.616 --> 26:16.327
Oh... honey bear.
[chuckles]

26:16.410 --> 26:19.455
See... now we come
to the point in our journey

26:19.538 --> 26:22.541
where it's time for you to think about
someone other than yourself.

26:23.251 --> 26:25.378
You brought people into this.

26:26.921 --> 26:29.007
You're responsible for us.

26:29.090 --> 26:30.549
If you wanna wear the crown,
you gotta be willing

26:30.634 --> 26:31.676
to fall on your sword.

26:31.760 --> 26:35.304
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm not worried.

26:35.847 --> 26:39.308
Someone is going to go down
for this, Chapman...

26:40.393 --> 26:42.020
and for my sake...

26:42.103 --> 26:43.562
I hope it isn't you.

26:46.650 --> 26:49.068
When you say that everybody hates me,

26:49.152 --> 26:51.070
you're being a little hyperbolic, right?

26:53.322 --> 26:55.033
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to wrap it up, ladies.

26:55.116 --> 26:56.492
-[inmates] Aw!
-Have a good day,

26:56.575 --> 26:58.787
and remember our theme.

26:58.870 --> 27:00.830
[inmates] Use what you've got!

27:00.914 --> 27:02.874
-[cheering]
-[Judy] Thank you.

27:05.584 --> 27:07.378
-Oh, good, good.
-[indistinct chatter]

27:09.338 --> 27:11.716
-Yes. Yes.
-All right. See you later. Thank you.

27:14.218 --> 27:15.344
Oh, Lord.

27:15.428 --> 27:18.306
Are you gonna keep dancing over there
like a little girl who has to pee

27:18.389 --> 27:20.308
or are you gonna come over here
and tell me what's wrong?

27:23.477 --> 27:24.603
[sing-song] Look.

27:25.271 --> 27:28.858
-What's this?
-That is freshly whipped butter.

27:28.942 --> 27:31.110
And Bill puts this Maldon salt

27:31.194 --> 27:33.404
in my care package.
This is my heroin.

27:33.487 --> 27:36.282
Now, I'm not supposed to tell anybody,
so keep quiet about it.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.201
There we go. Cheers.

27:40.912 --> 27:42.080
[Judy] Mmm!

27:42.163 --> 27:43.664
[garbled] Holy fuck.

27:43.748 --> 27:44.833
That's good.

27:44.916 --> 27:46.667
Better than a good shit in the morning.

27:46.751 --> 27:48.211
That's my favorite thing.

27:48.294 --> 27:50.964
[chuckling] Oh, sweetie,
that's everybody's favorite thing.

27:51.047 --> 27:52.631
Don't go thinking that makes you original.

27:53.299 --> 27:55.468
Now, what are you
moping about around here?

27:55.551 --> 27:57.470
Did your girlfriend write to you again?

27:57.553 --> 27:59.806
Well, she's not my girlfriend,
first of all...

27:59.889 --> 28:00.932
Right.

28:01.891 --> 28:02.934
I don't know, it's weird.

28:03.017 --> 28:05.269
I, like, care or something.

28:05.353 --> 28:07.731
-Oh.
-'Cause normally, I do not give a shit.

28:07.814 --> 28:09.858
-Mmm-hmm.
-About anything...

28:10.942 --> 28:12.235
and especially this.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.780
Maybe the chocolate I had was bad.

28:16.364 --> 28:19.492
It doesn't make sense, because...
she fucked up.

28:20.910 --> 28:23.454
Man, did she fuck up. But...

28:24.497 --> 28:26.332
[sniffs] I knew it was bad for her

28:26.415 --> 28:29.627
and I got involved anyway,
and now she's worse off than before.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.339
Really gotta suck ass down there.

28:33.422 --> 28:34.715
[sighs]

28:35.591 --> 28:37.593
God, what was that, like,
sympathy or something?

28:37.676 --> 28:39.053
Mr. Luschek...

28:39.137 --> 28:42.891
I believe that what you are
referring to is called guilt.

28:44.225 --> 28:46.435
[groans] But I don't have anything
to feel guilty about.

28:46.519 --> 28:48.104
Well, guilt is tricky that way.

28:50.148 --> 28:51.941
Yeah, look, I need an honest opinion.

28:54.778 --> 28:57.030
-Am I a piece of shit?
-Do you want it straight?

28:57.655 --> 28:59.073
-No.
-Mmm. All right.

28:59.157 --> 29:00.491
From what I've observed,

29:00.574 --> 29:04.245
you're lazy,
you're selfish as all get-out...

29:04.328 --> 29:07.749
you don't care about much,
you don't seem to shower that often.

29:07.832 --> 29:11.419
But you are funny as hell,
and I think you're genuine,

29:11.502 --> 29:13.712
which is hard to come by.
So, all in all,

29:13.797 --> 29:17.175
I think that makes you...
Hmm... What?

29:17.258 --> 29:18.426
Half a piece of shit.

29:19.427 --> 29:21.846
But there's always time for change.

29:22.972 --> 29:24.473
That's the thing. [clears throat]

29:24.557 --> 29:26.434
There's literally nothing for me to do.

29:29.312 --> 29:32.941
She's in max.
I can't do anything for her.

29:33.024 --> 29:35.568
And maybe she doesn't even deserve it,
even if I could do something.

29:35.651 --> 29:37.821
Well, everybody deserves kindness.

29:40.323 --> 29:41.490
[sighs]

29:41.574 --> 29:44.202
[laughs] Oh, God,
I really got you on that one.

29:44.285 --> 29:47.413
[chuckles] "Everybody deserves kindness"?

29:47.496 --> 29:48.790
What do you think I am?

29:48.873 --> 29:52.251
Some black granny knitting
on a porch in Savannah?

29:52.335 --> 29:53.586
Come on.

29:53.669 --> 29:56.923
Stop whining in my kitchen
and go figure this out.

29:57.006 --> 29:58.007
Oh...

29:59.133 --> 30:00.802
You are a straight, white man.

30:00.885 --> 30:02.636
You don't get to be the victim, sweetie.

30:03.304 --> 30:05.431
Yeah, that whole thing's
gonna flip at some point, right?

30:06.099 --> 30:07.100
[scoffs]

30:09.560 --> 30:11.520
-[buzzer blares]
-[indistinct chatter]

30:19.737 --> 30:21.364
[inmate speaking indistinctly]

30:22.198 --> 30:23.241
Hey.

30:38.047 --> 30:39.548
[Stella] Care if I join you?

30:48.557 --> 30:49.851
All right, what are you doin'?

30:49.934 --> 30:51.727
You're not in a very lovey mood, I see.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.062
"Lovey"?

30:53.146 --> 30:56.024
What is that? Is that, like,
an acceptable word where you come from?

30:56.107 --> 30:59.193
No, hey, 'cause here in America...
Yeah, that makes us barf.

31:00.528 --> 31:03.281
Okay, well, how would you describe
the other night in the bathroom then?

31:03.364 --> 31:05.283
'Cause the way you were
screaming my name...

31:05.366 --> 31:06.993
it was pretty hot.

31:07.076 --> 31:10.621
I was just doing my very best
<i>Streetcar Named Desire</i> impression.

31:12.957 --> 31:15.501
"Stella!"

31:15.584 --> 31:17.503
That's the, uh, the Meryl Streep one?

31:19.380 --> 31:21.590
Yeah, I hate it when you talk sometimes.

31:21.674 --> 31:22.800
No... [inhales sharply]

31:22.884 --> 31:24.010
all the time.

31:24.093 --> 31:25.553
Jesus.

31:27.055 --> 31:28.139
What's wrong?

31:29.140 --> 31:30.391
Nothing.

31:32.685 --> 31:34.478
You know, rough day.

31:40.693 --> 31:42.736
I thought I told you
to stay the fuck away from me

31:42.820 --> 31:44.572
if you were back on that shit.

31:45.864 --> 31:47.325
You're disgusting.

31:52.788 --> 31:53.831
Fucking hell.

31:53.915 --> 31:56.334
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

32:00.421 --> 32:01.797
Heard you need a thing I have.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.507
[Alison chuckles]

32:03.591 --> 32:07.136
A religion that'll stone me to death
if I get raped?

32:07.220 --> 32:08.930
Mmm, no thanks, I'm good.

32:09.805 --> 32:11.515
I'll go ahead and assume

32:11.599 --> 32:15.894
Bernie Madoff speaks
for your entire religion, too.

32:15.979 --> 32:17.730
Ignorant asshole.

32:19.898 --> 32:22.401
All right. Okay.

32:23.902 --> 32:25.071
Now...

32:28.199 --> 32:29.408
what you talkin' 'bout?

32:32.286 --> 32:33.997
[man speaking indistinctly on PA]

32:39.127 --> 32:41.629
Shit! Wait a minute.

32:42.588 --> 32:43.714
How'd you know I need that?

32:43.797 --> 32:47.760
You make the mistake of assuming
anything is private in here.

32:47.843 --> 32:49.095
All right, what you want for it?

32:49.887 --> 32:51.472
Box of tampons for 15 minutes.

32:51.555 --> 32:54.183
Oh, hell, no.

32:54.267 --> 32:57.478
Look, I'll give you
one tampon for an hour.

32:57.561 --> 32:59.272
That's unreasonable.

32:59.355 --> 33:01.107
[scoffs] So is God,
but that don't stop him.

33:01.190 --> 33:03.401
Are you comparing yourself to God?

33:03.484 --> 33:04.818
I mean, do you even have, like,

33:04.902 --> 33:07.738
one teeny-tiny, itty-bitty
bit of humor left in you?

33:07.821 --> 33:10.366
Or does your headscarf
numb that part of your brain?

33:11.242 --> 33:12.994
Offer's off the table.

33:13.077 --> 33:14.953
[smacks lips] Yeah.

33:15.038 --> 33:17.665
That's what I thought.

33:17.748 --> 33:20.626
You know you just lost, right?

33:20.709 --> 33:23.087
[scoffs] Winnin', losin'.

33:23.171 --> 33:27.175
I'm so enlightened, those words
don't mean nothin' to me.

33:30.469 --> 33:31.762
[Black Cindy sighs]

33:31.845 --> 33:33.056
[sighs]

33:38.686 --> 33:40.229
[Nicky] <i>Hey, I'm telling you,</i>
<i>you made a mistake.</i>

33:40.313 --> 33:42.148
[stammering] I don't get visitors.

33:48.112 --> 33:49.113
[chuckles softly]

33:49.197 --> 33:50.323
[chuckles]

33:51.782 --> 33:53.909
[indistinct conversations]

34:11.344 --> 34:12.803
Hello, sunshine.

34:12.886 --> 34:14.847
Oh, hey, fuckwad.

34:14.929 --> 34:17.225
Thanks for your sappy love letters.

34:17.308 --> 34:19.601
I wanted you to know I cared.

34:20.311 --> 34:22.438
You know, in my family,
"fuck you" meant, uh,

34:22.521 --> 34:24.690
"you really get me," so, joke's on you.

34:26.234 --> 34:27.735
What the fuck are you doin' here?

34:27.818 --> 34:29.152
I was in the neighborhood.

34:30.196 --> 34:32.156
Came to say hi,
thought you could use some company.

34:32.239 --> 34:34.408
Yeah, 'cause I'm really lonely, uh...
[chuckles]

34:34.492 --> 34:36.327
with my five roommates
and 400 other people

34:36.409 --> 34:38.579
that I gotta shit and eat with
on a daily basis.

34:38.661 --> 34:39.996
-[slams phone]
-Wait!

34:41.290 --> 34:42.416
[scoffs]

34:44.960 --> 34:48.214
You know, you put me
in a really crappy position, Nichols.

34:48.297 --> 34:49.757
I almost lost my job because of you.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.509
You're shitting me right now, right?

34:52.967 --> 34:54.344
Just gimme a second to work up to it.

34:55.053 --> 34:56.139
[breathes heavily]

34:56.222 --> 34:57.598
Look...

34:58.516 --> 35:00.893
I wanted to say that I'm sorry...

35:01.519 --> 35:02.561
-[scoffs]
-...that things

35:02.645 --> 35:04.062
ended up the way that they did.

35:04.147 --> 35:06.857
Now, I'm sure it's not great down here.

35:08.401 --> 35:09.485
There.

35:10.611 --> 35:12.321
-That's it.
-Wow!

35:13.906 --> 35:15.491
Are you the symbol of empathy.

35:15.574 --> 35:17.951
No, Luschek, things aren't great.

35:18.035 --> 35:22.998
[scoffs] Let's see, uh...
I'm sober, so that's something.

35:23.081 --> 35:26.335
All right, like, uh,
intentionally sober,

35:26.419 --> 35:29.713
not barely-skating-by sober,
for the first time in my life.

35:29.797 --> 35:32.508
Um... hardest fuckin' thing I've ever done

35:32.591 --> 35:34.760
and, oh, yeah,
I picked a hell of a time to do it

35:34.843 --> 35:37.680
considering that anything you want
down here is available to you

35:37.763 --> 35:39.932
and less than a foot away
at practically all times.

35:40.015 --> 35:43.186
Uh, what else, what else?
Let me catch you up, uh...

35:43.269 --> 35:47.356
I have no family, uh...
[sobs] I am completely alone.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.275
I have no friends.

35:49.358 --> 35:52.820
And, uh, yeah, yeah!
It's all my fault, so...

35:52.903 --> 35:57.032
thank you for coming all the way down here
and, uh, reminding me of all that,

35:57.115 --> 36:01.119
while also managing to conveniently
clear your own conscience, you know.

36:01.204 --> 36:03.080
-I fuckin' really appreciate it!
-[guard] Hey. Hey.

36:03.164 --> 36:04.498
I'm sorry. Uh...

36:04.582 --> 36:06.875
Hey, next time,
do me a favor, right,

36:06.959 --> 36:08.126
just do it the old-fashioned way

36:08.211 --> 36:11.214
and cum all over my face
and then leave, okay?

36:11.297 --> 36:12.923
Fuck you!

36:13.006 --> 36:14.758
-[sighs]
-[buzzer sounds]

36:14.842 --> 36:16.051
[door opens]

36:19.722 --> 36:21.349
[sighs]

36:21.432 --> 36:22.433
[door closes]

36:22.516 --> 36:24.518
[Brook moaning]

36:44.705 --> 36:46.207
[Poussey sniffs]

36:46.290 --> 36:47.375
[kisses]

36:50.669 --> 36:51.795
[Brook] Mmm.

36:54.089 --> 36:56.174
-[exhales]
-[chuckles]

36:56.259 --> 36:57.551
You okay?

37:01.805 --> 37:04.642
Does it bother you that I, like...

37:06.018 --> 37:07.102
I never...

37:08.145 --> 37:11.315
-Nah, girl. I'm good.
-You know... [sighs]

37:11.399 --> 37:13.150
But it's so one-sided.

37:13.234 --> 37:15.236
You admittin' you're a pillow princess?
[chuckles]

37:15.319 --> 37:17.280
-Okay, what is that? [chuckles]
-[laughs]

37:18.697 --> 37:20.408
-Oh.
-[both chuckle]

37:20.491 --> 37:21.909
You know, like, um...

37:21.992 --> 37:25.621
Your head's always on the pillow,
and you don't really do much else.

37:26.539 --> 37:29.667
-[laughs] Stop.
-That is totally what I am!

37:29.750 --> 37:32.002
Oh, no! [chuckling]

37:32.085 --> 37:34.338
See? I don't even know the lingo.

37:34.422 --> 37:36.424
You don't need to know the lingo.

37:38.884 --> 37:40.093
Look.

37:41.094 --> 37:42.179
[sighs]

37:43.306 --> 37:44.848
We'll ease into it, okay?

37:46.016 --> 37:48.561
All right? You don't have to do
anything you don't wanna do.

37:51.272 --> 37:52.815
You're ready when you're ready.

37:53.691 --> 37:54.942
[chuckles softly]

37:56.109 --> 37:57.152
[Brook chuckles]

37:59.029 --> 38:00.489
[Brook] You taste like vagina.

38:00.573 --> 38:02.491
[snoring loudly]

38:20.468 --> 38:22.803
[snoring continues]

38:37.401 --> 38:38.444
[exhales]

38:42.448 --> 38:45.784
So, did you figure it out yet,
you piece of shit?

38:47.578 --> 38:49.997
Rub my nose in it. Thanks.

38:50.748 --> 38:52.040
What happened?

38:53.542 --> 38:55.002
-I went to visit her.
-Mmm-hmm.

38:55.544 --> 38:56.545
Made it worse.

38:56.629 --> 39:00.257
Well, did you make it about her?
Or did you make it about yourself?

39:00.924 --> 39:02.050
I apologized to her.

39:02.134 --> 39:03.511
I thought you didn't do anything wrong.

39:04.928 --> 39:07.180
[chuckling] Yeah.
Well, I didn't.

39:07.890 --> 39:10.476
That makes my apology
even more meaningful.

39:10.559 --> 39:11.810
Only if it's genuine.

39:12.645 --> 39:14.688
-Who made up all these rules?
-[scoffs]

39:14.772 --> 39:16.649
Do you want me to call you
a piece of shit again?

39:16.732 --> 39:18.275
Would that be more helpful?

39:19.777 --> 39:21.028
[sighs]

39:22.112 --> 39:25.157
I gotta tell Caputo
how everything went down.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.450
That's the only way
to get her out of there.

39:26.534 --> 39:28.118
Won't you lose your job?

39:29.578 --> 39:30.621
Most definitely.

39:30.704 --> 39:34.833
[scoffs] Well, that is the most
idiotic plan that I have ever heard.

39:34.917 --> 39:38.671
Now, this is comin' from a lady who once
tried to sell her own line of ketchup.

39:39.505 --> 39:42.425
But... Heinz is the only ketchup.

39:42.508 --> 39:44.510
Nobody wants fancy ketchup.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.762
Where were you in '96?

39:47.680 --> 39:50.599
-I was 14.
-Oh, go fuck yourself. [laughs]

39:52.059 --> 39:54.562
Honey, you can't confess.

39:54.645 --> 39:57.314
It's not gonna do you or her
a lick of good.

39:57.398 --> 40:00.776
And besides, nobody ever confesses
because it's the right thing to do.

40:00.859 --> 40:03.028
They confess out of self-interest.

40:03.946 --> 40:05.322
-Yes, exactly!
-Hmm.

40:05.406 --> 40:07.491
I can't keep carrying around
all this guilt!

40:07.991 --> 40:10.578
Well, sounds like
you're gonna have to, my friend.

40:11.537 --> 40:12.955
[sighs]

40:13.038 --> 40:14.873
Now, can I get me some of that?

40:15.999 --> 40:18.752
Come on, butterscotch is my favorite.

40:21.964 --> 40:23.090
Thank you.

40:26.552 --> 40:28.011
Mmm!

40:29.179 --> 40:31.264
I really don't like feelings.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.975
[chuckles]

40:33.684 --> 40:34.893
Uh-uh.

40:34.977 --> 40:36.394
Puff, puff, pass.

40:41.233 --> 40:43.777
Charleston, West Virginia.

40:43.861 --> 40:45.112
-[inmate shouts indistinctly]
-[buzzer sounds]

40:45.195 --> 40:47.823
Madison, Wisconsin.

40:47.906 --> 40:49.450
[cell door slams]

40:49.533 --> 40:52.327
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

40:53.161 --> 40:55.456
Montgomery, Alabama.

40:55.539 --> 40:56.582
You, cleaning lady.

40:56.665 --> 40:58.416
We need a mop in room 12.

40:59.417 --> 41:04.923
Well, I prefer Ms. Cleaning Lady,
but sure, demean me.

41:06.258 --> 41:07.425
[sighs]

41:26.820 --> 41:28.030
Where's Burset?

41:29.031 --> 41:30.658
Shut up and do your work...

41:30.741 --> 41:33.243
Ms. Cleaning Lady.
We need that cell.

41:43.546 --> 41:44.588
[Poussey chuckles]

41:46.214 --> 41:48.258
-Good morning to you, too.
-[chuckles]

41:48.341 --> 41:50.177
[Poussey chuckles]

41:50.260 --> 41:51.386
[Brook clears throat]

41:53.221 --> 41:54.222
What's up?

41:54.306 --> 41:56.016
[Brook] Mmm-mmm. [giggles]

41:56.099 --> 41:57.350
[both chuckle]

41:59.520 --> 42:00.646
What?

42:03.941 --> 42:06.109
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey.

42:07.235 --> 42:08.696
You don't have to do that.

42:08.779 --> 42:11.323
-But--
-Look, I don't want you to do that

42:11.406 --> 42:13.826
'cause you think that's what I want.

42:13.909 --> 42:16.954
I want you to want to do it.
You feel me?

42:17.788 --> 42:19.372
[softly] I don't wanna
screw this up again.

42:20.165 --> 42:21.416
[scoffs]

42:23.794 --> 42:25.503
What's... what's going on up there?

42:28.131 --> 42:29.257
[sighs]

42:32.928 --> 42:35.097
What if I never want to?

42:35.848 --> 42:39.017
I just have all these questions, you know?
Like...

42:39.101 --> 42:40.728
what does this mean?

42:41.854 --> 42:44.147
What would happen if we both got out?

42:48.986 --> 42:49.987
I...

42:52.364 --> 42:54.366
I don't know
if this would be enough for me.

42:55.784 --> 42:58.746
You mean, you don't know
if I would be enough for you.

42:58.829 --> 43:03.375
But... No, it's not you.
You are amazing.

43:04.126 --> 43:06.962
But you're a girl. [sighs]

43:07.045 --> 43:09.006
So you're saying
you don't wanna be with me.

43:09.089 --> 43:10.090
No.

43:11.091 --> 43:12.092
I...

43:13.135 --> 43:14.970
I just don't know...

43:16.013 --> 43:19.516
if I'll ever be
what you need me to be.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.393
You gotta let me handle that.

43:22.352 --> 43:23.687
[softly] What do you mean?

43:25.939 --> 43:29.401
[inhales deeply] Look, maybe...

43:30.986 --> 43:33.405
this challenges what you thought you were.

43:36.033 --> 43:40.746
And... maybe I'm gonna get my heart broken
in a thousand different pieces.

43:41.789 --> 43:43.290
But those are maybes.

43:45.626 --> 43:47.836
You can't live your life
accordin' to maybes.

43:49.797 --> 43:50.881
[chuckles softly]

43:52.841 --> 43:53.842
I love you.

43:58.681 --> 43:59.682
[whispering] You do?

44:02.142 --> 44:03.226
[chuckles]

44:05.896 --> 44:07.773
I love you, too.

44:10.483 --> 44:11.526
[chuckles]

44:18.450 --> 44:20.118
[clattering]

44:20.202 --> 44:22.830
She can see us. Move over.
[chuckles]

44:22.913 --> 44:24.331
[indistinct chatter]

44:27.918 --> 44:30.420
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

44:31.714 --> 44:33.340
[Lolly] I have 11 cards.

44:33.423 --> 44:34.925
[Alex] You're supposed
to have 11 cards.

44:35.008 --> 44:36.760
-[Lolly] Okay, good. That's good.
-[Alex laughs]

44:36.844 --> 44:38.553
Then, that... No, this is awesome.

44:39.221 --> 44:40.305
Hey, Alex.

44:41.389 --> 44:42.683
Can I talk to you for a sec?

44:43.767 --> 44:45.643
-Alone?
-Whatever you need to say to me,

44:45.728 --> 44:47.604
you can say in front of
my good friend, Lolly, here.

44:47.687 --> 44:49.314
That's me.
I'm the good friend.

44:49.397 --> 44:51.149
I didn't know you two were so close.

44:51.233 --> 44:53.526
Oh, you didn't get the, uh,
friend announcement that we sent out?

44:53.610 --> 44:54.694
[chuckles]

44:54.778 --> 44:58.031
I'm kind of in a rush,
but I would really like to talk to you.

44:58.115 --> 44:59.699
It's not laundry day.

45:00.533 --> 45:03.120
Well, I've got a lot of dirty stuff, so...

45:05.247 --> 45:08.125
Okay. [scoffs]
Cool.

45:09.042 --> 45:11.169
What did you mean when you said
you were right?

45:14.506 --> 45:16.466
Nothing, I just...

45:16.549 --> 45:19.261
I just knew you were gonna get
swept up in all that.

45:21.554 --> 45:22.639
Oh.

45:23.640 --> 45:27.978
Well, they say hindsight is 20/20, so...

45:28.061 --> 45:29.271
See you later.

45:31.774 --> 45:36.820
Okay, that was like watching
a really bad play.

45:39.907 --> 45:41.199
[indistinct chatter]

45:55.088 --> 45:56.714
What the hell is this mess doin' here?

45:56.799 --> 45:58.884
[stammering] We had it cleared
20 minutes ago, sir.

45:58.967 --> 46:01.469
I left to go on rounds,
and by the time I came back,

46:01.553 --> 46:03.471
it was up again.
We can't keep on top of it.

46:03.555 --> 46:06.058
Well, take care of it. Now.

46:07.642 --> 46:10.562
-Hey, you have a place to sleep.
-[Pidge] Ow! What the fuck?

46:10.645 --> 46:13.023
Rouse it up!
You have quarters.

46:13.106 --> 46:16.443
-Who the fuck just kicked me?
-[Piscatella] Wake-up time.

46:16.526 --> 46:18.320
-I was just-- [gasps]
-[inmates exclaim]

46:18.403 --> 46:20.948
[Piscatella] Get these pillows,
get these sheets, fold them.

46:21.031 --> 46:22.615
It hasn't even healed yet!

46:22.699 --> 46:24.201
[Piscatella] Come on.

46:24.284 --> 46:28.455
You don't need your own tepee.
This is a prison, not a sleepover.

46:28.538 --> 46:30.958
[Ouija] Oh, shit! Yo, warden!

46:31.041 --> 46:33.751
Hey, yo. Long time no see, man.

46:33.836 --> 46:35.170
Yo, how's it hanging?

46:35.253 --> 46:38.548
-Hey, looking sharp, huh?
-Step back, inmate.

46:38.631 --> 46:39.757
We have this handled, sir.

46:39.842 --> 46:41.551
-[sighs]
-[Pennsatucky] Hey, Mr. Caputo.

46:41.634 --> 46:44.512
Look at this.
It's a basket I've been making.

46:44.596 --> 46:45.848
You wanna know how?

46:45.931 --> 46:48.391
-Sure.
-I've been unraveling all the socks

46:48.475 --> 46:49.809
that people throw away.

46:49.893 --> 46:54.272
Individually dyeing each strand
with the pink soap in the bathroom,

46:54.356 --> 46:58.110
or the green mush, I think it's peas,
and other stuff with color.

46:58.193 --> 47:03.448
Then, I took the string
and I weaved it over trash bags.

47:03.531 --> 47:06.118
Three hundred hours.
Still not done.

47:06.201 --> 47:08.453
Yeah, idle time is the devil's workshop.

47:08.536 --> 47:10.205
When do we get to work?

47:10.288 --> 47:13.125
[Zirconia] Yeah, I can't pay
for nothin' at commissary.

47:13.208 --> 47:15.418
Age discrimination.
That's what I'm calling it.

47:15.502 --> 47:18.213
Inmates, back up.

47:18.296 --> 47:19.839
I'll have this under control
in five minutes--

47:19.923 --> 47:21.091
I've got this.

47:23.343 --> 47:27.597
Ladies, I have heard your complaints...

47:27.680 --> 47:31.101
and trust me,
they have not fallen on deaf ears.

47:31.726 --> 47:33.770
In fact, I can't tell you much yet,

47:33.853 --> 47:39.151
but we have an exciting new educational
program that will be announced soon.

47:39.234 --> 47:41.153
Bringin' back the GED program?

47:41.236 --> 47:43.405
[inmate 1] Yeah, remember that one?
[inmate 2] Mmm.

47:43.488 --> 47:45.532
I think you'll all be very satisfied.

47:45.615 --> 47:48.201
In the meantime, hang in there.

47:48.285 --> 47:50.828
Keep your heads up, okay?
And...

47:52.039 --> 47:55.375
take care of each other.
This is beautiful work.

47:55.458 --> 47:58.545
Thanks. [smacks lips]
And I'll believe it when I see it.

47:58.628 --> 48:00.880
-You'll see it.
-All right, let's go. Make a path.

48:00.964 --> 48:02.424
Let's make a path.

48:02.507 --> 48:04.092
[inmates speaking indistinctly]

48:04.176 --> 48:05.427
Caputo!

48:05.510 --> 48:09.681
[inmates chanting] Caputo! Caputo! Caputo!

48:13.643 --> 48:15.853
-What happened to you?
-I'm not sure.

48:18.523 --> 48:21.068
-She's still out?
-Goin' on hour 19 now.

48:25.530 --> 48:27.365
Guess she really needed to sleep.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.202
I'm sorry, okay?

48:30.285 --> 48:32.412
God, why is everyone always so mad at me?

48:33.413 --> 48:34.581
[Maritza] <i>You think she's dead?</i>

48:35.707 --> 48:38.418
I don't like her that much, but I wouldn't
want her to be dead or nothin'.

48:38.501 --> 48:41.588
We'd have heard if she was dead.
Ain't no secrets in this place.

48:41.671 --> 48:45.258
But if she is dead, I call dibs on those
little glasses she wears on a string.

48:45.342 --> 48:47.135
I think my eyes are starting to go.

48:47.219 --> 48:49.262
Looks like it's your lucky day, inmate.

48:50.180 --> 48:51.806
Yo, what the fuck are you doing?

48:51.889 --> 48:54.351
-Get off me, man. Ouch!
-Nah, I don't think I will.

48:54.434 --> 48:55.602
We searched your bunks.

48:55.685 --> 48:57.479
Found some interesting evidence
under your bed.

48:57.562 --> 48:59.189
-What? What?
-Underwear evidence.

48:59.272 --> 49:00.690
Dude, you blew the mystery.

49:00.773 --> 49:03.068
Oh, come on. Like she doesn't know
what's under her own bunk?

49:09.324 --> 49:11.159
What the fuck?

49:12.410 --> 49:16.331
As I understand,
Cindy, you need a cell phone.

49:16.414 --> 49:19.334
-Mmm-hmm.
-Abdullah, you have a cell phone.

49:19.417 --> 49:23.463
I am sure we can reach
some sort of agreement for this problem.

49:23.546 --> 49:26.549
No, the problem is she gobblin' up
all my real estate

49:26.633 --> 49:28.176
like some hateful <i>Monopoly</i> shoe.

49:28.260 --> 49:32.389
I am always the car in <i>Monopoly.</i>

49:33.181 --> 49:34.391
You know...

49:34.474 --> 49:38.978
I never did shit to you
except claim what was rightfully mine.

49:39.854 --> 49:42.607
They gave me a bed, I slept in it.

49:42.690 --> 49:45.818
And ever since, you been makin'
this bunk an unsafe place.

49:45.902 --> 49:47.779
[Black Cindy laughs sarcastically]

49:47.862 --> 49:51.158
See, that's funny, 'cause I think
nine out of ten experts would agree

49:51.241 --> 49:54.119
that you made shit unsafe
when you put a bomb in here.

49:54.202 --> 49:58.206
I retaliated against actions you took.

49:58.290 --> 50:00.417
-Oh, hell, no...
-[indistinct arguing]

50:00.500 --> 50:04.754
Ladies! Ladies. Let's remember
to use "I" statements, please.

50:04.837 --> 50:08.425
Seems like diggin' up the past
ain't gonna get us nowhere.

50:08.508 --> 50:14.056
Let's try to remember to stay focused
on moving forward.

50:15.223 --> 50:16.766
Fine.

50:16.849 --> 50:18.810
I... want in.

50:18.893 --> 50:22.105
You can use the phone
for however long you want,

50:22.189 --> 50:25.483
if I get 25% of the payday
you get from that magazine.

50:25.567 --> 50:26.776
[snorts]

50:26.859 --> 50:28.945
-Seems fair to me. Cindy?
-[scoffs]

50:31.323 --> 50:32.657
I don't trust her.

50:33.408 --> 50:36.578
So? You think people trusted
L. Ron Hubbard?

50:37.370 --> 50:39.664
Fuck, no.
But that don't stop Scientologists

50:39.747 --> 50:41.958
from handing over
fistfuls of money to him.

50:42.041 --> 50:44.627
I know! Hold...

50:44.711 --> 50:47.672
-You read <i>Going Clear?</i>
-Of course!

50:47.755 --> 50:50.717
How about when
that crazy psycho told his wife

50:50.800 --> 50:52.969
to kill herself
so he wouldn't have to get divorced?

50:53.052 --> 50:54.887
-I know, man! I know!
-Mmm-hmm.

50:54.971 --> 50:56.848
You know them fuckers
don't even pay taxes?

50:56.931 --> 50:59.351
-Oh, girl!
-And we're the criminals?

50:59.434 --> 51:02.104
I heard that.
Oh, I got a theory!

51:02.187 --> 51:03.313
-What's your theory, dawg?
-[blows raspberries]

51:03.396 --> 51:05.982
What if he like Tupac?
Not really dead.

51:06.065 --> 51:07.567
-Mmm.
-Still alive?

51:07.650 --> 51:09.486
-Alive!
-[laughs]

51:11.529 --> 51:14.449
-They're not mine.
-I should hope not.

51:14.532 --> 51:17.285
That's a lot of dirty underpants
for one girl...

51:17.369 --> 51:19.954
-in a lot of different sizes.
-Yeah, I didn't do nothing.

51:20.037 --> 51:23.416
See, that's where our perspectives
start to diverge, Ruiz...

51:23.500 --> 51:25.918
because the evidence says otherwise.

51:26.002 --> 51:27.254
Come on.

51:28.588 --> 51:30.257
Everyone knows that's Chapman's gig.

51:30.923 --> 51:32.425
-Chapman?
-[scoffs]

51:32.509 --> 51:36.221
Who started the very task force
that uncovered your illegal operation?

51:36.304 --> 51:38.890
[chuckles] I don't think so.

51:38.973 --> 51:41.559
That's it, isn't it, right?

51:41.643 --> 51:43.811
If I was white and blonde,

51:43.895 --> 51:47.064
you wouldn't think so about me, either.
[clicks tongue]

51:47.149 --> 51:50.693
Well, that's some corrupt racist bullshit
you're runnin' 'round here.

51:51.819 --> 51:55.365
In light of your crimes...
I will be recommending

51:55.448 --> 51:59.369
that the judge add three to five years
to your sentence.

52:00.787 --> 52:02.705
Uh... what?

52:03.873 --> 52:06.668
Are you--
[stammers] You can't do that.

52:07.669 --> 52:11.381
Come on, just send me to the SHU for
a couple of weeks and get it over with.

52:11.464 --> 52:15.218
It's fucking underwear!
We're not talking about drugs here! Jesus!

52:15.968 --> 52:17.053
That would be easy, right?

52:17.136 --> 52:19.847
Send you away for a couple weeks,
forget this ever happened.

52:20.723 --> 52:23.518
Well, that's not how things work
around here anymore, inmate.

52:24.018 --> 52:25.562
-You stole property...
-[scoffs]

52:25.645 --> 52:29.232
...from a private company
and started a for-profit business.

52:29.316 --> 52:31.901
You organized inmates.

52:31.984 --> 52:33.445
You ask me,

52:33.528 --> 52:36.113
-looks a whole lot like gang activity...
-Oh, come on.

52:36.198 --> 52:39.201
...which you would know a lot about,
wouldn't you?

52:39.284 --> 52:40.535
Isn't that the family business?

52:41.911 --> 52:44.414
You know what we do
with gang leaders, Ruiz?

52:45.498 --> 52:47.209
We make examples of 'em.

52:48.626 --> 52:51.671
So get back down there
and tell your <i>muchachas</i>

52:51.754 --> 52:53.673
how poor choices...

52:53.756 --> 52:54.799
can ruin a life.

52:56.259 --> 52:57.719
Maybe cry...

52:58.428 --> 52:59.762
'cause it's so sad.

53:04.392 --> 53:05.560
[sighs]

53:09.439 --> 53:10.898
[knocking on door]

53:13.610 --> 53:17.905
Just say thank you, and then get back
to being your cute, gruff self.

53:19.407 --> 53:22.410
-Excuse me?
-I solved your problem. Say thank you.

53:23.620 --> 53:26.539
-What problem?
-[scoffs] With your little friend?

53:27.164 --> 53:28.165
I don't understand.

53:28.250 --> 53:30.209
Oh, honey.

53:30.293 --> 53:33.004
A little money and a good lawyer
go a long way.

53:33.087 --> 53:35.757
[scoffs] Then why are you in prison?

53:35.840 --> 53:37.216
[chuckles]

53:37.300 --> 53:39.886
You don't wanna fuck with the IRS,
that's all I can tell you.

53:41.220 --> 53:42.264
So she's really comin' back?

53:42.347 --> 53:45.892
Ugh. Don't look at me
like I am some kind of saint.

53:46.726 --> 53:48.978
You're my only friend in here.

53:49.061 --> 53:51.731
I was not about to let you make
some kind of stupid decision

53:51.814 --> 53:54.191
and leave me here all by myself.

53:54.276 --> 53:56.319
Nor could I take your bellyaching anymore.

53:56.403 --> 53:58.613
-[chuckles]
-Two birds, one stone.

53:58.696 --> 54:01.240
Now, get over here.

54:01.324 --> 54:02.742
Have a seat.

54:03.826 --> 54:04.994
I'm-- I really shouldn't.

54:05.077 --> 54:08.247
If you close that door,
nobody will know you're in here.

54:12.335 --> 54:13.795
[laughs]

54:15.505 --> 54:16.756
[Judy] Oh, I'm sorry.

54:16.839 --> 54:18.841
Did I make it sound like you had a choice?

54:20.843 --> 54:22.345
I took care of you.

54:23.888 --> 54:26.766
Now you are gonna take care of me.

54:27.850 --> 54:29.811
[whispers] Butterscotch.

54:30.978 --> 54:32.439
[chuckles]

54:32.522 --> 54:33.648
[sighs]

54:50.582 --> 54:52.750
-Stay cool.
-What's happening?

54:52.834 --> 54:54.377
I was a shark.

54:54.461 --> 54:55.503
I made a move.

54:56.170 --> 54:57.797
[breathing heavily]

55:00.800 --> 55:04.095
I am going to bury you!

55:04.178 --> 55:07.640
You're never coming back from this.
Never.

55:14.731 --> 55:15.857
What did you do?

55:15.940 --> 55:19.026
[breathing shakily]
I had to protect my people.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.530
I had to.

55:26.701 --> 55:28.077
You okay?

55:29.412 --> 55:31.456
[breathes deeply]

55:33.040 --> 55:35.251
They're giving me more time.

55:35.334 --> 55:38.337
This bitch frames me,
and they're stealing my life.

55:38.421 --> 55:39.756
What? Over fucking panties?

55:39.839 --> 55:41.424
Yo, my baby girl's gonna be
in kindergarten

55:41.508 --> 55:43.134
by the time I get outta here now.

55:44.010 --> 55:45.219
That bitch is mine.

55:51.643 --> 55:53.770
Fuck it. [sniffles]

55:54.771 --> 55:56.856
-We goin' legit.
-Fuck, yeah.

55:56.939 --> 55:58.190
You talkin' 'bout drugs?

55:58.274 --> 56:00.234
-Yes, you idiot.
-All right.

56:00.317 --> 56:01.861
It's about time we was for real.

56:10.036 --> 56:11.496
[indistinct chatter]

56:27.679 --> 56:28.930
I'm here about the thing.

56:33.142 --> 56:34.436
You understand the payment?

56:54.747 --> 56:56.666
[sighs] Need your signature on this.

57:02.505 --> 57:03.548
Nichols?

57:05.091 --> 57:06.300
Huh.

57:07.218 --> 57:10.012
Well, my prodigal daughter returneth.

57:23.693 --> 57:25.361
Payment first.
