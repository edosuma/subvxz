00:23.291 --> 00:27.461
What's up? This is K107,
broadcasting on New Year's Eve.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.930
Why don't you all scribble
down those New Year's
resolutions,

00:29.997 --> 00:33.467
dial me up, tell us those lies
you're telling yourself--

00:33.534 --> 00:35.569
promises you know
you won't keep.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.838
I don't believe
in New Year's resolutions.

00:37.905 --> 00:41.041
They're stupid.
I promise this year
I will not--

00:41.109 --> 00:42.610
No matter what John says,

00:42.676 --> 00:44.912
this year I'm starting
my catering business.

00:44.978 --> 00:47.981
And if I do
ever let Russell come back,

00:48.048 --> 00:50.218
I'm gonna whip something
on him so tough.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.286
I'm gonna lose 10 pounds
and eat right.

00:52.353 --> 00:55.856
Fifteen pounds.
Okay, 35.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.391
Thirty-five pounds.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.694
**

01:02.296 --> 01:04.532
Do you know where
you want to be tonight...

01:04.598 --> 01:07.067
and where you want to be
next year?

01:07.135 --> 01:10.604
Think about it.
'Cause we're getting close
to that final hour.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.441
So if you haven't finished
those New Year's resolutions,

01:13.507 --> 01:15.909
you better jump on it
before it's too late.

01:15.976 --> 01:19.347
I've made mine.
How about you?

01:19.413 --> 01:22.383
This is brand-new
from the beautiful
ChantÃ© Moore.

01:22.450 --> 01:26.086
"Wey U." K107.
Check it out.

01:26.154 --> 01:30.324
**

01:38.366 --> 01:41.202
The deal is,
the men in Denver are dead.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.971
No wonder
I'm changing towns again.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.240
It's got to be better
in Phoenix.

01:49.310 --> 01:53.181
**

02:04.425 --> 02:06.194
I gotta pick up the babysitter,

02:06.260 --> 02:08.762
pick up my gown,
stop and get John's tux.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.365
Ooh, I'd clone myself,

02:11.432 --> 02:13.401
but I wouldn't have time
for the surgery.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.643
I don't know
why I always pick the wrong men
to fall in love with.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.247
My weakness is pretty boys
with big sticks.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.787
I don't know
why Tarik has to spend
New Year's Eve with his homeys.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.756
He sees them every day.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.527
Plus there are gonna be
all these drunk fools
in the streets.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.430
He'd have more fun at home
with me watching videos.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.632
I just want you to know...

02:44.698 --> 02:48.001
that if you're searching,
somewhere there's
a love for you.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.638
**

02:50.704 --> 02:55.008
and I'm geeked up
for a blind date
that's not even all that.

02:55.075 --> 02:58.779
Just some party
this guy's voice invited
my answering machine to...

02:58.846 --> 03:01.449
when we got worn out
playing phone tag.

03:03.083 --> 03:08.121
A long time ago, I asked God
to send me a decent man.

03:08.188 --> 03:12.460
I got Robert, Cedric,
Darrell and Kenneth.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.929
God's got some
serious explaining to do.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.065
So my prayers got more detailed.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.434
Like, how about some compassion?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.436
Could he have
a sense of purpose?

03:22.503 --> 03:24.672
A sense of integrity?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.407
Could he listen?

03:26.474 --> 03:28.876
The truth is,
most men are deaf.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.413
They prefer to guess
what you need.
But they don't guess worth shit.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.082
They lie without a conscience.

03:35.148 --> 03:39.086
What they're best at
is convincing us
we should feel desperate.

03:39.152 --> 03:41.188
Thank God I don't fall
for that shit.

03:41.255 --> 03:44.725
**

03:44.792 --> 03:47.361
If I had the nerve,
I'd get me some real breasts.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.303
Oh, I know
that's gotta be Mama.

03:55.369 --> 03:58.138
She's the only one knows
I'm staying in a hotel.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.610
I love you, Ma,
but tonight--

04:05.613 --> 04:07.581
I'll call you
in the morning, Ma.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.986
**

04:16.089 --> 04:20.260
I do not feel
like going to another one
of these boring affairs.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.535
Bernie?
Yes?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.540
Would you be
terribly disappointed...

04:32.606 --> 04:35.008
if we didn't go
to the party tonight?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.747
Crushed.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.717
What?

04:45.353 --> 04:50.591
I guess there's no
appropriate time
to tell you this, but...

04:50.658 --> 04:53.761
I'm going to the party,
just not with you.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.231
She--
She?

04:58.298 --> 05:00.401
Yes.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.770
She doesn't want
to be alone tonight,

05:02.836 --> 05:04.772
and I was thinking,
"Why should she be?"

05:10.744 --> 05:13.481
It's that bitch who keeps
your books, isn't it?

05:14.748 --> 05:16.984
And you picked tonight
to flaunt your whore...

05:17.050 --> 05:20.320
in front of all your business
partners and your friends.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.857
What the hell are they
supposed to think, John?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.325
The truth.

05:25.393 --> 05:26.960
Finally, the truth.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.764
I'm leaving you for her.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.134
This is a test of
the Emergency Broadcast System.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.704
This is only a test.
Don't worry.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.406
You can have the house.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.340
And you know
I'll take care of my kids.

05:40.408 --> 05:42.376
You wait a minute.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.311
I give you 11 fuckin' years
of my life,

05:44.378 --> 05:46.747
and you're telling me
that you're leaving me
for a white woman?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.916
Would it be better
if she were black?

05:48.982 --> 05:51.519
No. It'd be better
if you were black.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.527
Thank you, Bernadine,

06:01.395 --> 06:03.397
for making this easier...

06:03.464 --> 06:04.998
for me.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.474
I'll be back next week
for my things.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.178
[ Emergency Tone
Continues, Stops ]

06:18.245 --> 06:21.949
This concludes this test of
the Emergency Broadcast System.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.451
All right.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.053
Time to get your groove on.
"All Night Long."

06:26.119 --> 06:29.623
I don't believe I'm spending
New Year's Eve by myself.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.860
Now, this is
definitely a first.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.864
Finally gave up on Russell.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.867
A lyin', sneaky,
whorish Pisces.

06:41.469 --> 06:44.104
Russell was so fine.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.675
Probably...

06:47.741 --> 06:50.544
every woman in America
wanted to be with him.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.782
But you know what, Achey?

06:54.848 --> 06:57.718
Oh, I knew
he was mine...

06:57.785 --> 06:59.152
till--

07:00.521 --> 07:03.557
till I found that half slip
in his gym bag.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.259
**
**

07:06.326 --> 07:08.195
Phone's ringing
off the hook tonight...

07:08.261 --> 07:11.264
from women wondering
where all the real men are.

07:11.331 --> 07:13.801
So, for all you
fellows out there
running the streets...

07:13.867 --> 07:16.504
looking for love
in all the wrong places,

07:16.570 --> 07:18.506
there's something
you should know.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.008
Love might be waiting
right there at home.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.156
Ma, I wish you were
going out tonight.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.791
Hmm.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.994
I'm just fine,
thank you.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.512
You're coming in
at a decent hour tonight.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.348
Ma, it's New Year's Eve.
Things don't start
jumping off until midnight.

08:01.414 --> 08:03.951
You ought to be
praising God I'm letting
you go out at all,

08:04.017 --> 08:05.653
the grades
you bringing in here.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.387
You know, you best get busy.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.890
You're gonna be using Morse code
to contact them little
girlfriends of yours.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.192
Look, I'm doing the best I can,
so just ground me now.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.170
You know your father's
coming on Tuesday.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.938
And?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.508
First of all,
he's not my father.
He's my daddy.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.211
- And there's a big
damn difference.
- Now, you watch your mouth.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.381
Look, I see the bastard
once every two years,
and I'm supposed to get excited?

08:34.447 --> 08:36.683
You get excited.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.787
I can't believe this, man.
Why's she doing this?

08:39.852 --> 08:42.623
What is that
supposed to mean?

08:43.791 --> 08:45.593
Where'd he sleep
the last time he was here?

08:49.329 --> 08:52.132
Oh, man.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.768
Ma, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

08:54.835 --> 08:58.405
Ma, I'm sorry.
Ma, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.907
I'm really-- I'm sorry.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.575
That's none
of your business.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.176
I'm sorry.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.915
**

09:07.981 --> 09:11.218
This is K107, broadcasting live
from the Hermosa.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.154
And this is where
the party's going down.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.757
Why are you sitting there
when you could be sitting here
in my room?

09:16.824 --> 09:19.927
Let Brandy tell you.
Check it out. K107.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.529
**

09:22.596 --> 09:25.398
* Seems like ever since *

09:25.465 --> 09:27.935
- * The first day we met *

09:28.001 --> 09:29.870
* There is no one else *

09:29.937 --> 09:32.940
* I think of more than you *

09:33.006 --> 09:35.709
* Can't seem to forget *

09:35.776 --> 09:38.445
* Can't get you
out of my head *

09:38.511 --> 09:40.380
* Guess the verdict's in *

09:40.447 --> 09:43.684
* I'm crazy over you *

09:43.751 --> 09:46.019
* How can one be down? *

09:46.086 --> 09:48.421
* Tell me where to start *

09:48.488 --> 09:50.658
* 'Cause every time you smile *

**

09:54.895 --> 09:56.730
Excuse me,
is anyone sitting here?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.866
No. Please, join us.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.702
She has her nerve,
sitting down here.

10:01.769 --> 10:02.970
Hell yeah.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.505
I'm single and desperate
and have no morals.

10:05.572 --> 10:07.607
And as soon as one of you
turns your back,

10:07.675 --> 10:09.376
I'm gonna flirt my butt off...

10:09.442 --> 10:11.945
and then take your man.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.250
Can't stand women
like her.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.585
Please.
Mmm.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.220
**

10:20.287 --> 10:24.658
* I'm just a mess
with a thing for you *

* Pray that you'll invest *

Savannah?

10:28.696 --> 10:29.730
Lionel?

10:29.797 --> 10:33.066
Hi. How are you?

10:35.635 --> 10:38.171
God, if this man
isn't the one,

10:38.238 --> 10:40.173
at least let me dance
till I sweat.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.009
Would you like to dance?
I'd love to.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.811
All right.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.513
God, you look
so beautiful tonight.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.881
Thanks.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.783
I'm certainly glad
we finally met.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.752
You made it here safely
in one piece.

10:51.819 --> 10:55.155
Well, our answering machines
almost moved in with each other.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.457
Glad we met too.

10:57.524 --> 11:00.994
**

11:15.575 --> 11:20.848
* I'm gonna make you my wife *

11:20.914 --> 11:24.517
* 'Cause you're my everything *

11:24.584 --> 11:28.221
* All my hopes and dreams *

11:28.288 --> 11:30.958
* Come true *

11:32.092 --> 11:35.729
* I can live my life *

11:35.796 --> 11:39.066
* With you *

11:40.801 --> 11:44.071
Mmm. You feel so good.

11:44.137 --> 11:48.641
* I'm gonna buy you
some rings *

11:48.708 --> 11:51.078
Thank you, Jesus.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.182
And then I did it.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.317
I closed my eyes...

11:57.384 --> 12:00.053
and I exhaled--

12:01.789 --> 12:06.994
* What you make me feel *

12:07.060 --> 12:10.163
and pretended
this man was mine.

12:10.230 --> 12:14.434
That he was everything
I ever dreamed of.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.569
That he was the one...

12:16.636 --> 12:18.906
I'd been waiting for
all my life.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.009
Lionel.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.012
Lionel.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.980
You haven't danced
with me all night.

12:30.984 --> 12:34.487
Uh, Savannah,
this is my friend
Denise.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.296
* Cross my heart
and hope to die *

12:43.363 --> 12:45.765
If I hurry, I can still
catch Dick Clark.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.036
**

12:49.102 --> 12:51.138
What's up, Joseph?
I like them pants.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.473
Well, thank you, girl.
Hey, Joseph, did he show up?

12:53.540 --> 12:55.008
Hmm! You think he didn't?

12:55.075 --> 12:57.144
Come on, honey, you next.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.246
Ooh, Gloria,
look at this.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.150
Oh. That's nice.
It's very nice.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.018
Looks just like
in the book too--

13:05.085 --> 13:06.586
Hey, Gloria, do you
like this color?

13:06.653 --> 13:08.721
I'm charging you 25 cents
for each finger, Robin.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.457
You're gonna
charge me what?

13:10.523 --> 13:13.126
Robin, why don't you just
come on out of my shop,

13:13.193 --> 13:16.029
go back to that little
hot-shit insurance company
you working for?

13:16.096 --> 13:18.065
Because, baby doll,
I don't punch in or out.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.666
I got it like that.
Remember?

13:19.732 --> 13:21.334
Lunch hour is over.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.770
So I guess you guys
have heard, huh?

13:23.837 --> 13:25.238
What?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.107
John left Bernie.

30:23.789 --> 30:26.058
* My world *

30:26.125 --> 30:30.796
* Is filled
with so much pleasure *

30:30.863 --> 30:34.266
So, where's Tarik?

30:35.201 --> 30:37.569
He's not here right now.

30:41.207 --> 30:43.609
I don't know why
I continue to do this.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.544
He's almost grown.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.447
Yes, he is.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.652
Would you like some wine?
No.

30:53.719 --> 30:55.321
No, thanks.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.822
Sure?
Mmm.

30:56.889 --> 31:01.127
* Nothing else matters *

31:01.193 --> 31:04.997
* You're my heart *

31:05.064 --> 31:07.833
When exactly
are you expecting him?

31:07.900 --> 31:10.169
Mmm! Tomorrow.

31:15.942 --> 31:17.543
Wait!

31:17.609 --> 31:19.145
David.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.816
You know you can
always stay here.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.285
Here?

31:26.352 --> 31:28.921
Yeah. Uh--

31:28.988 --> 31:31.958
I thought that maybe we--
you know.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.493
We could--
Well, like last time.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.762
I should be honest with you.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.065
About what?
About me.

31:39.131 --> 31:42.168
What about you?

31:42.234 --> 31:43.402
Hmm?

31:46.338 --> 31:48.640
Do you remember how I didn't
respond to you last time?

31:48.707 --> 31:52.178
Of course I remember.
I--

31:54.713 --> 31:56.949
I thought it was because
I gained weight and--

31:57.016 --> 32:00.252
I have been
bisexual for years.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.523
What

32:04.590 --> 32:06.158
You heard me right.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.261
But I'm not anymore.
I'm gay.

32:10.396 --> 32:11.697
David!

32:11.763 --> 32:14.633
David, you don't have to go
to this extreme just because--

32:14.700 --> 32:17.769
Look, Gloria, I don't
have to lie about this.

32:17.836 --> 32:21.240
I-I've lied
too long as it is.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.610
I am.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.312
I'm staying at the Biltmore.

32:26.378 --> 32:30.116
And if...
he ever wants to see me,

32:30.182 --> 32:32.551
he has to make
the first move.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.955
If I don't hear from him
by noon, I'm checking out.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.957
And I mean just that.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.898
Oh--

32:46.965 --> 32:49.001
Come on.
It's an offer you can't refuse.

32:49.068 --> 32:52.471
Okay.

32:52.538 --> 32:56.475
Ooh! Onika, honey,
put that one over there too.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.080
Ma, are we just
selling daddy's stuff?
Yes, honey.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.415
Here you go.
Thank you.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.683
Why come?

33:04.750 --> 33:07.919
Ooh! "Why come?"
Oh, Onika.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.222
"Why."
Why?

33:10.289 --> 33:13.292
Because he asked me.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.961
Yes.
It's just collecting dust.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.697
Oh, uh, bring the wine.
Hurry. Come on.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.500
I'll get it.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.203
She told me to get it!
No, she told me to!

33:24.270 --> 33:26.272
She told me!
Give it to me!
No!

33:26.338 --> 33:29.308
Oh, man.

33:29.375 --> 33:34.180
Look what you did.

33:34.246 --> 33:37.383
- That's right, sir.
Thank you.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.386
Enjoy your skis.

33:45.924 --> 33:48.327
Mmm!

33:48.394 --> 33:51.063
**

34:05.010 --> 34:10.782
* My funny valentine *

34:12.918 --> 34:18.489
* Sweet comic valentine *

34:19.690 --> 34:21.993
* You make me *

34:22.060 --> 34:24.963
* Smile *

34:25.030 --> 34:27.132
* With my heart *

34:27.199 --> 34:29.400
**

34:29.467 --> 34:31.770
I didn't think
I'd ever see him again.

34:31.837 --> 34:34.840
But he did call to apologize.

34:38.043 --> 34:41.079
That's my toothbrush!
Is he crazy?

34:41.147 --> 34:44.616
Turns out this guy
has no real income.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.318
Chain-smokes reefer.

34:46.385 --> 34:49.821
Brags about being a vegetarian,
then inhales three hot dogs...

34:49.888 --> 34:53.125
like it's the last time
somebody's gonna buy him a meal.

34:53.192 --> 34:57.229
I gave him $20 for gas,
which came to $7.18,

34:57.296 --> 34:59.331
and he didn't even
give me my change.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.202
My fantasy was to get myself
a little piece.

35:03.269 --> 35:06.605
You know, get my feet wet
in a new town.

35:06.672 --> 35:09.375
Well, not exactly my feet.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.579
Hell, it's been five months.

35:14.546 --> 35:18.384
And he has gotten
on my last nerve.

35:19.518 --> 35:23.021
But I don't have to be
in love with him to do it.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.357
Hell, my body needs this.

35:25.424 --> 35:29.795
**

35:29.861 --> 35:31.663
* Don't, baby, don't *

35:31.730 --> 35:35.801
* Don't you change your hair
for me *

35:37.536 --> 35:40.306
Lionel, baby, um,
we've got all night.
You can take your time.

35:40.372 --> 35:42.073
I'm just so excited.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.943
I've been thinking about
what I'd do to you
since New Year's.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.148
Hold on, baby.
I'm on my way.
What?

35:51.883 --> 35:54.019
"Grr"?

35:56.054 --> 35:57.856
"Grr," huh?

36:08.567 --> 36:11.503
Now I'm a keeper
at the damn zoo.

36:17.243 --> 36:19.311
Kathleen.
John,
the year-end reports...

36:19.378 --> 36:20.979
on the Geary account
are right here.

36:21.046 --> 36:24.350
Everyone have a copy?
Thank you.

36:25.851 --> 36:29.488
If you examine the profile
on the Geary report,
you'll find--

36:29.555 --> 36:31.623
Bernadine,
I'm in a meeting here.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.592
If you need something,
I suggest--

36:33.659 --> 36:36.595
Would you mind terribly
if I had a few words
with my husband?

36:36.662 --> 36:39.398
- No--
- What the hell
are you doing?

36:39.465 --> 36:42.401
I've been to the bank.
Thank you!

36:42.468 --> 36:44.336
Thank you for thinking
of your children!

36:44.403 --> 36:46.638
Everybody out!
Yes, out! Out!

36:46.705 --> 36:49.040
You don't come
into my office...

36:49.107 --> 36:52.444
and start throwing
some tantrum because you can't
finish what you started.

36:52.511 --> 36:54.546
What am I supposed
to do for money?

36:54.613 --> 36:56.282
I gave you the house.
Now sell it!

36:56.348 --> 36:58.216
I hate you!

36:59.751 --> 37:02.354
I'm really sorry
to hear that, Bernadine.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.923
But I'm not playing games
with you anymore.

37:04.990 --> 37:09.795
Who do you think started
this damn company, huh?

37:09.861 --> 37:11.997
Let's not start that again,
all right?

37:12.063 --> 37:15.401
And now you think you can
just take the money and run!

37:15.467 --> 37:17.969
Business hasn't been
good for years.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.472
But don't you worry about it.
You'll get what's coming to you.

37:20.539 --> 37:23.475
Hell, I'm not worried.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.412
You, on the other hand,
should be.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.282
Okay. Look.

37:30.349 --> 37:35.521
Let's not let this thing get
any uglier than it already has.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.589
Is everything all right
in here, Mr. Harris?

37:37.656 --> 37:38.857
Fine.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.192
Now, I'm willing--
I'm more than willing--

37:41.259 --> 37:42.728
What, you gonna
put me out, Joe?

37:42.794 --> 37:45.631
to give you $300,000
cash today!
You here to put me out?

37:45.697 --> 37:48.700
Your children
aren't for sale.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.371
One more thing
before you go.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.973
I'm coming for my kids
on Saturday.

37:56.074 --> 37:57.743
Yeah?

37:57.809 --> 38:01.913
And if I hear you had them
anywhere near
that tramp bitch,

38:01.980 --> 38:05.551
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life!

38:10.989 --> 38:15.594
**

38:22.668 --> 38:23.769
Tarik?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.339
Get out of my goddamn house!

38:27.406 --> 38:29.641
I'm-I'm sorry.
Get out!

38:29.708 --> 38:31.643
I'm sorry.
Ma, I'm so sorry.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.412
I told you
you was grounded.
I know.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.780
That's why
I invited her over, Ma.
I'm sorry.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.247
You know, I'm about
sick of this shit!

38:36.314 --> 38:38.049
If your daddy wasn't gay,
I swear to God,

38:38.116 --> 38:40.452
I'd send your black ass
straight to him!

38:41.687 --> 38:43.522
Shit.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.557
You saying
my father's a faggot?

38:50.596 --> 38:52.197
I don't like
to use that word.

38:52.263 --> 38:54.400
Ma.

38:54.466 --> 38:57.969
Faggot, gay, homo--
it's all the same.

38:59.905 --> 39:01.940
So my daddy's a queer.

39:04.209 --> 39:06.144
My daddy--
My daddy's a queer.

39:06.211 --> 39:08.013
My daddy's a queer.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.549
Yo, my father's a queer!

39:10.616 --> 39:13.151
He's a fucking queer!
My father's a fucking queer!

39:13.218 --> 39:15.053
I said stop it!

39:15.120 --> 39:18.857
One thing's for sure.
It ain't running in the family.
'Cause, you know--

39:20.058 --> 39:21.860
You best watch your mouth.

39:26.432 --> 39:29.701
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
You're sorry?

39:29.768 --> 39:31.703
You're sorry
about everything,
aren't you, Tarik?

39:31.770 --> 39:34.640
You're sorry about lying to me!
You're sorry about your grades!

39:34.706 --> 39:39.010
Sorry about letting some
little girl in here to suck on
your little 17-year-old dick!

39:39.077 --> 39:42.047
How can I trust you in Spain
if I can't trust you
here, huh?

39:43.281 --> 39:44.783
You just get out
of my face.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.853
Ma, will you just let me--
You better get
out of my face.

39:57.095 --> 40:00.499
Now, this is something
we should definitely focus
our attention on this quarter.

40:00.566 --> 40:03.201
This account comes up
for renewal June 1.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.704
The workers' comp premium
is about a million and a half,

40:05.771 --> 40:07.973
and the loss experience
has been excellent.

40:08.039 --> 40:11.109
What does
the engineering report show?

40:14.546 --> 40:17.148
It shows an active
safety environment.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.817
Well, actually,

40:18.884 --> 40:21.787
I, uh, found a discrepancy
in the report.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.522
Oh, really? Hmm.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.056
Now, if everyone could
turn to page 20,

40:25.123 --> 40:26.758
we can look
at the graph.

40:26.825 --> 40:29.828
Page 20.
If you'll excuse me.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.865
So you want to do your job?

40:33.932 --> 40:36.134
Well, you will never
get another whiff of this.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.969
Yes?

40:38.036 --> 40:40.639
So it appears that everything
he's purchased...

40:40.706 --> 40:44.009
in the last 10 years
is in his name only--

40:44.075 --> 40:45.711
including the business.

40:47.045 --> 40:50.482
Look, I'm not trying
to get rich here.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.718
But I want to be able
to pay my mortgage...

40:52.784 --> 40:55.120
and take care
of my children.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.689
Their education.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.758
I just want to be okay.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.760
All right?

41:01.827 --> 41:06.431
Look. I'm not gonna lie to you.
We're in for a fight.

41:06.498 --> 41:09.801
But I promise you,
I will do my best.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.273
Bernie, this is the stupidest
move you've made yet.

41:15.340 --> 41:17.308
Just because you're upset
with your husband--
I love you, Gloria,

41:17.375 --> 41:19.010
but I'm not gonna debate
this with you.

41:19.077 --> 41:22.113
I'm not here for a lecture.
But I've been doing
your hair for 11 years.

41:22.180 --> 41:25.584
One ignorant move by your
husband, you gonna come in
and chop off all of your hair?

41:25.651 --> 41:27.953
Now come on, Gloria.
Do it.
I'm not doing this.

41:28.019 --> 41:31.089
What is the fuckin' big deal?
Just cut it, Gloria!
No, I'm not!

41:31.156 --> 41:33.124
You gonna wake up tomorrow
feelin' stupid--
All right! Fuckin' fine!

41:33.191 --> 41:37.829
You don't wanna cut this
fuckin' shit off my head,
I'll do it my goddamn self!

41:37.896 --> 41:40.065
Fine. Fine.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.768
You want me to cut it,
I'll cut it. How short
do you want it, huh?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.936
You want it
shorter than mine
or short as mine?

41:45.003 --> 41:48.940
You know, I can always
use a razor too.
I can't believe you.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.309
Eleven years of growing
your hair out, and look
at what you doing.

41:51.376 --> 41:53.545
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Fine.

41:53.612 --> 41:56.715
**

42:06.858 --> 42:09.861
I don't know why they call
this mess "happy hour."

42:09.928 --> 42:11.763
Well, it's still
early yet, girl.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.799
Oh, sweetie,
that's not it.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.634
Is this your first time
hanging out?

42:15.701 --> 42:20.005
I hate to be the one
to break it to you, but...
this is as good as it gets.

42:21.172 --> 42:23.208
Mmm.

42:24.576 --> 42:26.311
I feel like dancing.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.980
All right, girl.
Don't hurt yourself
or nobody else.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.951
Mmm! You go, girl!

42:33.885 --> 42:35.654
How you like
that new haircut?

42:35.721 --> 42:37.756
I don't like it.
I don't either.

42:37.823 --> 42:40.425
I like it.
You like it?
Yeah, it look all right.

42:40.491 --> 42:42.961
It's nice.
It's sharp on her.

42:43.028 --> 42:45.363
Hello, stranger.
Bernadine, how are you?

42:45.430 --> 42:46.798
Wonderful, thank you.

42:46.865 --> 42:49.067
Ooh, that's
Herbert Webster.

42:49.134 --> 42:51.637
Used to be a pro
football player.

42:51.703 --> 42:54.205
Now he's a newscaster
or a sports agent.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.374
And fine as hell.

42:56.441 --> 43:00.378
And if she don't want him? Mmm!
I'll slam-dunk him tonight.

43:00.445 --> 43:02.447
He's also very married.

43:02.513 --> 43:04.249
And?

43:04.315 --> 43:07.285
She's only dancing
with him, y'all.
Damn.

43:07.352 --> 43:09.688
Are you blind?
Look at her.

43:09.755 --> 43:12.390
Mm-mmm. She flirtin'
with that man.

43:12.457 --> 43:13.591
Mmm!

43:16.094 --> 43:19.230
Shoot, I could be home
watching Good Times.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.299
Why aren't you deadbeats
out here dancing?

43:21.366 --> 43:24.502
Now, you can drink
and talk at home.
Girl, you're too hot for me.

43:24.569 --> 43:26.237
You better watch out
for that man.

43:26.304 --> 43:30.942
Who
Oh, he's harmless.

43:31.009 --> 43:34.245
Besides,
if his wife's at home,
he better watch out for me.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.047
Ooh! Give me some.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.850
Ooh! You're bad.

43:40.118 --> 43:42.821
Well, I guess that means
he's available.

43:43.855 --> 43:45.891
You know you wanna dance.

43:47.893 --> 43:50.028
Why, thank you.
Yeah.

43:50.095 --> 43:53.598
* Baby, baby *

43:53.665 --> 43:55.967
Oh, I don't even
believe this shit.

43:56.034 --> 43:58.036
Uh-oh.
What's the deal?

43:58.103 --> 44:00.171
Who is it this time?
What's going on?

44:00.238 --> 44:03.742
I mean, it's only been
a week since I fired him,
and he was talking marriage.

44:04.943 --> 44:06.611
Well, don't forget
you dropped him.

44:06.678 --> 44:09.915
And please don't
embarrass yourself.
And please don't embarrass us.

44:09.981 --> 44:10.982
Please.

44:12.718 --> 44:15.687
Oh, I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction.

44:15.754 --> 44:17.723
Little fat fuck.

44:19.124 --> 44:21.626
Robin,
did you see Michael?

44:21.693 --> 44:23.328
Oh, she saw him.

44:23.394 --> 44:24.595
Michael who?

44:24.662 --> 44:26.998
* Just the other day *

44:27.065 --> 44:31.102
* And your own sister told me *

44:31.169 --> 44:33.438
* Someone was taking my place **

44:33.504 --> 44:37.375
I've only known Troy
for three days, but already
I feel close to him.

44:37.442 --> 44:40.712
I wish he didn't smoke,
but I can live
with one bad habit.

44:40.779 --> 44:42.914
Yeah, he's real cool people.

44:42.981 --> 44:45.516
He's a lawyer,
but he's down to earth.
You'll like him.

44:45.583 --> 44:47.518
Mmm.
**

44:47.585 --> 44:50.922
**

44:52.523 --> 44:56.161
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Whoo! Whoo!

44:56.227 --> 45:00.899
Oh, shit!

45:00.966 --> 45:03.969
Oh! My favorite
Caucasian, Wild Bill!
Troy.

45:04.035 --> 45:06.671
The good stuff is here.

45:06.738 --> 45:09.674
Oh, man.
Check out my honey, huh?
Mmm.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.442
Bill, Robin.
Robin, Bill.

45:11.509 --> 45:13.078
Hey, would you like
some wine?

45:13.144 --> 45:15.180
No. I don't think
we have time.

45:15.246 --> 45:19.284
You just got here.
Oh, come on, woman,
we got time for a glass of wine.

45:19.350 --> 45:20.952
Go and relax yourself.

45:21.019 --> 45:24.389
* Make a brother moan
No need to stop, baby
That shit turns me on *

45:24.455 --> 45:26.091
Stop!

45:26.157 --> 45:29.627
Whoo! Ha!
Don't let the smooth taste
fool you!

45:29.694 --> 45:31.062
* That shit turn you on? *

45:31.129 --> 45:33.198
* That shit turns me on *

45:33.264 --> 45:36.401
* That shit turns me on *
* That shit turn you on? *

45:36.467 --> 45:39.070
**

45:39.137 --> 45:40.906
* That shit turn you on? *

45:40.972 --> 45:43.474
* That shit turns me on *

45:43.541 --> 45:45.376
**

45:45.443 --> 45:47.112
Excuse me.

45:47.178 --> 45:49.347
* You can be my sonic
and, baby, I'll be your boom *

45:49.414 --> 45:51.516
* Just a little bump and a grind
That's fine *

45:51.582 --> 45:53.618
**

45:56.521 --> 45:58.656
* It's better
when it's me and you
doing the double do *

45:58.723 --> 46:01.459
* So, uh,
forget the problems-- *

46:01.526 --> 46:04.495
* Hoochie-coochie mama
'Cause that shit turns me on *

46:06.297 --> 46:09.300
Might as well be with Russell
if I'm gonna deal
with this shit.

46:09.367 --> 46:13.271
Baby! Got that wine.

46:13.338 --> 46:14.940
Troy, I'm ready to go.

46:15.006 --> 46:17.843
Come on, woman,
these are my--
No! I'm ready to go now.

46:20.745 --> 46:22.447
Oh, that shit turns me on.

46:22.513 --> 46:25.450
* That shit turns me on
Yeah, yeah **

46:25.516 --> 46:27.285
Hey, Vannah, this is Mike.

46:27.352 --> 46:29.754
I got a few questions
on the Colin Powell episode.

46:29.821 --> 46:32.723
Ring me at extension 455.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.759
Miss Jackson, this is Doreen.

46:34.826 --> 46:38.964
I've got a few messages for you
at the front desk, along with
a FedEx package. Thank you.

46:40.966 --> 46:43.568
Savannah, this is Kenneth.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.104
Hope you haven't forgotten me.

46:46.171 --> 46:48.907
I'll be out your way next month
for a medical conference.

46:48.974 --> 46:50.976
It would mean a lot to me
to see you.

46:51.042 --> 46:52.743
Hope you're well.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.412
Bye now.

46:54.479 --> 46:56.982
God, I used to crave this man.

46:57.048 --> 46:58.850
He treated me like a lady.

46:58.917 --> 47:02.954
And once you get used to
being treated well,
you can't go back to bullshit.

47:04.655 --> 47:07.092
No mystery
how he got my number.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.159
Hello?

47:08.226 --> 47:09.827
Hi, Mama.
How you doing?

47:09.895 --> 47:13.564
Well, since you ask,
my hair ain't been dyed
in so long,

47:13.631 --> 47:15.133
my roots are green.

47:17.035 --> 47:19.537
Mama, why did you give
Kenneth my number?

47:19.604 --> 47:22.874
'Cause he asked for it.
Why? Is he coming
out there or something?

47:22.941 --> 47:26.311
You tell me.
Girl, he gonna be
out there on the 26th.

47:26.377 --> 47:30.015
Ain't you excited?
Mama, the man is married.

47:30.081 --> 47:34.419
Well, how happy can he be
if he went out of his way
to find me to get to you?

47:34.485 --> 47:35.653
Mama, please.

47:35.720 --> 47:37.255
Please my behind, girl.

47:37.322 --> 47:39.690
I'll be so glad when you
get up off that high horse.

47:39.757 --> 47:43.028
And stop trying to act like you
don't need nothing or nobody.

47:43.094 --> 47:47.298
Every woman needs a man.
And you ain't no exception.

47:47.365 --> 47:51.269
Mama, I love you,
and I'll talk to you soon.
Good-bye.

47:54.705 --> 47:57.142
I won't squeeze him back
when he hugs me.

47:57.208 --> 48:00.145
I will not look him
in the eyes.

48:00.211 --> 48:03.281
And I'm definitely
not gonna give him any.

48:05.616 --> 48:09.520
Hey. Hey. Hey. See?
Told you about all that.

48:09.587 --> 48:11.389
Ol' feisty thing.

48:11.456 --> 48:15.193
See, you making
too much about all this.
It ain't even about nothin'.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.666
Girl, am I gonna have to
whip it out and tame you?

48:23.068 --> 48:26.104
Am I gonna have to
tame you?

48:26.171 --> 48:28.339
Hey, you feel that?
See how hard that is?

48:28.406 --> 48:30.775
You did that, girl.
It's got your name on it.

48:30.841 --> 48:34.112
Troy, you know what?
I think we should
cool out for a while.

48:34.179 --> 48:36.114
This is not working.

48:36.181 --> 48:38.516
Well, you know, this comes
at sort of a bad time.

48:39.684 --> 48:41.852
And why is that,
because you want some tonight?

48:41.919 --> 48:44.522
No, I'm not talking
about tonight.
I'm talking about Sunday.

48:45.890 --> 48:48.593
My mother wanted me
to invite you over
for a barbecue.

48:48.659 --> 48:52.063
Oh, you think I'm making
all this up 'cause you mad?

48:52.130 --> 48:55.333
You mad
Huh?

48:55.400 --> 48:57.468
Well, here.
Why don't you call her?

48:57.535 --> 48:59.570
Why don't you call her?

48:59.637 --> 49:02.307
555-1467.

49:07.412 --> 49:10.015
Troy, why do you want me
to meet your mother?

49:10.081 --> 49:13.218
I have only known you
for three days.

49:13.284 --> 49:16.054
Maybe it's because
I feel a little different
about you...

49:16.121 --> 49:18.323
than you seem to feel
about me.

49:19.157 --> 49:21.292
But I can't help that.

49:23.328 --> 49:24.996
Robin.

49:31.002 --> 49:34.472
No man ever asked me
to meet his mother before.

49:34.539 --> 49:37.275
Maybe he's not into
the stuff all that much.

49:37.342 --> 49:40.211
And maybe if we got to know
each other better,

49:40.278 --> 49:43.114
I might be a good influence
on him.

49:43.181 --> 49:46.017
**

49:47.918 --> 49:49.754
He thinks he's gonna
get away with it?

49:49.820 --> 49:52.523
I'm not gonna
let him get away with it.
That's right.

49:52.590 --> 49:54.592
You know he has a whole
apartment building,

49:54.659 --> 49:56.927
200 acres of farmland
in California...

49:56.994 --> 49:59.397
and a vineyard
right here in Arizona?

49:59.464 --> 50:01.799
And did you know they
made wine in Arizona?
Yeah.

50:01.866 --> 50:05.536
Huh? Well, I didn't.
Girl, this mess will get you
a week on Sally Jessy.

50:05.603 --> 50:08.973
I'm tellin' you, Glo.
This is how women
get screwed.

50:09.040 --> 50:12.310
Too lazy to look out for
yourself, so you put all
your trust in your husbands.

50:12.377 --> 50:15.213
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
But I finally
got the answer.

50:15.280 --> 50:18.216
Just never
get fuckin' married.

50:18.283 --> 50:21.286
Hmm. Lots of us
got that answer.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.354
I thought you had
the answer to something.

50:23.421 --> 50:26.324
You had the answer to that one,
honey, you'd be on the cover...

50:26.391 --> 50:31.796
of Cosmo, Newsweek,
Psychology Today,
Jet, Essence, Ebony!

50:33.264 --> 50:35.200
Don't make me laugh.
I'm mad.

50:35.266 --> 50:36.901
Mad magazine!

50:36.967 --> 50:39.637
**

50:39.704 --> 50:42.673
And they're off, in the first
race of the ostrich festival!

50:42.740 --> 50:45.810
- And it's Swift Kicker
in the blue takes the lead.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.278
Bern, if I ask you
something,

50:47.345 --> 50:48.846
will you promise
you won't get mad?

50:48.913 --> 50:51.015
What is it?

50:51.082 --> 50:52.883
You been messing around
with Herbert?

50:52.950 --> 50:57.655
Swift Kicker and Exactly,
and it's Swift Kicker by a nose!

50:57.722 --> 50:59.257
Bernie!

51:00.291 --> 51:02.493
I spent one evening
with him.

51:04.795 --> 51:06.831
Look, I didn't want
to marry him.
I just--

51:07.832 --> 51:10.201
I-I wanted to, you know--

51:10.268 --> 51:12.303
I needed to get laid,
so I did.

51:12.370 --> 51:14.339
Now how you gonna say
something like that?

51:14.405 --> 51:17.442
Easy. Men been doing
this shit for years.

51:17.508 --> 51:19.544
Hmm.

51:19.610 --> 51:21.946
I'm telling you, it was
like watchin' paint dry.

51:28.853 --> 51:33.358
Girl, now he callin'
and pagin' me all hours
of the day and night.

51:33.424 --> 51:34.959
Showed up at my house
unannounced.

51:35.025 --> 51:37.728
My child answers the door.
Now, you know that
freaked me out.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.164
Uh-huh.

51:39.230 --> 51:41.499
I don't know
what he's thinking.
Mmm.

51:41.566 --> 51:43.568
I tap-danced for a man
for 11 years.

51:43.634 --> 51:46.971
I'm not about to go out
and get me a new owner.
Mmm.

51:47.037 --> 51:49.574
Yeah, Bernie,
but you know you're wrong.

51:49.640 --> 51:53.144
Now, see, that's why
I didn't want to tell you.

51:53.211 --> 51:55.680
I'm not like you, Gloria.

51:55.746 --> 51:59.150
I... need somebody
to hold me.
Hmm.

52:01.919 --> 52:03.888
Even if it is a damn lie.

52:05.723 --> 52:07.124
Hmm.

52:07.192 --> 52:10.995
Lady Lydia, Fancy Nancy
and Patty's Pucker...

52:11.061 --> 52:12.997
coming up
in that lady llama race.

52:13.063 --> 52:15.800
Don't forget about the arts
and craft fair next weekend.

52:15.866 --> 52:19.003
Girl, Russell's
been paging me all day,
but I'm through with him.

52:19.069 --> 52:22.072
I'm seeing Troy now.
Yeah, yeah. But you know
what he does, Robin.

52:22.139 --> 52:24.975
He says he only
does it sometimes.

52:25.042 --> 52:28.546
Girl, what do you
expect him to say?
"I'm a crackhead"?

52:28.613 --> 52:32.950
So, you think I shouldn't
go to the barbecue?

52:33.017 --> 52:35.420
Robin, let me put it
to you this way.

52:35.486 --> 52:39.123
What have you done
in three days
with this man,

52:39.190 --> 52:43.628
besides screw him,
that would make
knowing you so deep...

52:43.694 --> 52:46.831
that now he wants
to take you home
to meet his mama?

52:46.897 --> 52:50.735
A barbecue?
Please, girl.

52:50.801 --> 52:54.171
Yeah. I can't call him though.
I put his card in my wallet.

52:54.239 --> 52:56.674
Now I can't seem to find
my wallet anywhere.

52:56.741 --> 52:59.244
Oh, that really
surprises me, Robin.

53:00.245 --> 53:02.447
Hold on.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.148
Mm-hmm.

53:04.215 --> 53:06.651
Hello?

53:09.854 --> 53:11.789
I been missing you, baby.
Since when?

53:11.856 --> 53:14.759
Since I been gone.
Want some company?
Yes.

53:14.825 --> 53:17.928
I'll see you in 15.
Bye, Russell.

53:20.365 --> 53:21.566
Savannah?
Yes.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.701
I gotta go.
Something I gotta do.

53:23.768 --> 53:25.236
Is it Russell?

53:25.303 --> 53:27.104
No, it's not Russell.

53:27.171 --> 53:29.307
Mm-hmm. I bet.

53:29.374 --> 53:31.509
So what if it is?

53:31.576 --> 53:34.245
Well, enjoy the lowlife
while you can, girlfriend.

53:34.312 --> 53:36.281
Good-bye.

53:38.082 --> 53:39.884
That girl is something.

53:39.950 --> 53:45.456
**

53:45.523 --> 53:52.363
* Anytime that you
feel the need *

53:52.430 --> 53:56.334
* And I'll be there
in a hurry *

53:56.401 --> 53:57.968
Come on, baby.

53:58.035 --> 54:00.070
Troy is such
a waste of my time.

54:00.137 --> 54:02.273
Come on now.
Come over here.

54:02.340 --> 54:04.742
Russell's the only man
I really loved.

54:04.809 --> 54:06.577
Look at him.

54:06.644 --> 54:08.713
What are you acting
like you don't wanna
come over here?

54:08.779 --> 54:10.648
Damn.

54:10.715 --> 54:12.082
Mmm.

54:12.149 --> 54:16.186
Last time we were together,
he wanted to spend
the whole night.

54:16.253 --> 54:18.289
And he would have--

54:18.356 --> 54:21.859
except he had to take
his mama to church
early the next morning.

54:24.962 --> 54:27.532
People change.

54:27.598 --> 54:30.901
And you can't hold a few
mistakes against someone
for the rest of their life.

54:30.968 --> 54:33.538
**

54:34.639 --> 54:37.475
**

54:58.896 --> 55:02.099
God bless you and your family.

55:02.166 --> 55:03.834
Sister Gloria,
you're looking good.

55:03.901 --> 55:05.736
Have a good day now, Deacon.
God bless you, sister.

55:05.803 --> 55:08.973
Deacon Scott.
God bless you.
Take care.

55:09.039 --> 55:10.708
Hi.

55:13.243 --> 55:15.446
Savannah, let's go
have breakfast.

55:15.513 --> 55:17.682
Let's go get something.

55:17.748 --> 55:20.485
What? I'll cook.
You know I'll cook.

55:21.452 --> 55:25.022
**

55:29.394 --> 55:32.463
* Everything's gonna *

55:32.530 --> 55:35.966
* Be all right *

55:36.033 --> 55:39.604
* Everything's gonna *

55:39.670 --> 55:41.806
* Be all right *

55:41.872 --> 55:44.074
Give me a hug.

55:45.042 --> 55:47.378
Hey, John Jr.--

55:47.445 --> 55:50.481
What's up, Ma?
Hey.

55:50.548 --> 55:52.383
Mmm! I missed you.

55:55.786 --> 55:58.889
Enjoy the doll, okay?
Bye, Daddy.
Thank you.

55:58.956 --> 56:00.124
Bye.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.161
Hi, Mama.
Hi, sweetie.

56:04.228 --> 56:06.464
Two days
is too long, huh?

56:16.707 --> 56:19.877
Come on.
Let's go inside, huh?

56:25.249 --> 56:27.918
**

56:33.491 --> 56:36.927
Whew!
Shit, it's hot.

56:36.994 --> 56:39.930
Damn.

56:39.997 --> 56:41.932
Hey! Hey! Yoo-hoo!

56:41.999 --> 56:43.668
Robin! Hey!

56:46.704 --> 56:48.573
You ready, baby?

56:49.540 --> 56:51.175
I'm not going.

56:53.844 --> 56:55.012
Why not?

56:56.280 --> 56:58.182
Because, Troy,

56:59.617 --> 57:01.285
I don't like this.

57:08.358 --> 57:10.728
Y

57:16.066 --> 57:17.468
Okay.

57:17.535 --> 57:19.470
All right.

57:19.537 --> 57:23.908
So-So what am I supposed
to tell my mother and my son
and the rest of my family?

57:23.974 --> 57:27.512
Your son?
How old is this son?

57:27.578 --> 57:30.848
He's almost 13.
What's your point?

57:30.915 --> 57:34.985
My point is,
I don't think we're ready
for family reunions yet.

57:35.052 --> 57:37.522
What am I supposed
to tell them, Robin?

57:39.323 --> 57:40.725
Tell them
whatever you want to.

57:40.791 --> 57:43.227
Oh, so I'm just
supposed to accept this?

57:43.293 --> 57:47.164
You don't have a choice.
You should have asked me
before committing me.

57:47.231 --> 57:50.267
- I did ask!
- No, you told me!

57:50.334 --> 57:52.903
You come here
two hours late, and I'm
supposed to go with you?

57:52.970 --> 57:55.305
Oh, I don't think so.
Robin!

57:55.372 --> 57:57.107
Robin!

57:57.174 --> 57:58.709
It's locked, Troy.

58:01.712 --> 58:03.648
Baby, it's too hot
for this shit.

58:03.714 --> 58:06.551
Can you come get the door?
No.

58:06.617 --> 58:09.520
Can I use your bathroom?
Hell no!

58:11.689 --> 58:15.125
Do you have any idea how many
women would love for me...

58:15.192 --> 58:18.095
to take them to my house
so they can meet my mother?

58:18.162 --> 58:20.297
Oh, I can just about guess.

58:20.364 --> 58:24.368
Man, you black bitches
is all the same.

58:24.434 --> 58:26.837
"Bitch"?
You complain
all the time...

58:26.904 --> 58:30.841
about don't nobody
want your asses,
don't know how to treat ya!

58:30.908 --> 58:33.077
As soon as a man--
a brother--

58:33.143 --> 58:36.981
show you genuine interest,
you bitches act simple.

58:37.047 --> 58:40.718
Then you wonder why
we go out with white women.

58:40.785 --> 58:44.288
A white woman can have
your sorry ass.

58:46.924 --> 58:49.293
Don't you throw that
up here!

58:51.562 --> 58:54.364
You raggedy bitch.

58:54.431 --> 58:58.168
You better be more careful
who you pick up
in grocery stores next time!

58:58.235 --> 59:01.338
Troy, take your drunk-ass,

59:01.405 --> 59:03.240
leather-wearing-
in-the-summertime,

59:03.307 --> 59:05.643
need-a-shave,
stinky-ass home.

59:05.710 --> 59:07.745
I'm not going.

59:07.812 --> 59:10.480
Have a fruit bowl, tramp!

59:10.547 --> 59:12.650
Punk!
Forget you!

59:13.784 --> 59:15.586
Forget you!

59:15.653 --> 59:17.622
All right.
It's like that?

59:17.688 --> 59:19.323
It's like that then.
Bye.

59:19.389 --> 59:20.658
**

59:20.725 --> 59:23.894
So, Robin, I guess you know
who's got your wallet?

59:23.961 --> 59:25.495
What?

59:25.562 --> 59:27.431
You think he stole it?

59:27.497 --> 59:29.399
Robin,
I don't believe you.
Good-bye.

59:29.466 --> 59:31.602
I got to hang up.

59:33.503 --> 59:35.039
Whew.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:07.938
Hi. I'm Gloria Matthews
from across the street.

01:00:08.005 --> 01:00:10.240
I was wondering--

01:00:10.307 --> 01:00:13.110
What do you know about
these people moving in here?

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:18.248
Well, uh, the guy,

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:22.219
in my opinion, seems to be
nasty and, uh, ignorant.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.488
And bossy.

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:27.124
Oh. What about his wife?

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:31.628
Well, she-- she died
a couple of years ago.

01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:34.932
But this is one of the many
precious items that
she bought for him...

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:37.201
that I'm makin' sure
don't get broken.
Oh, that's nice.

01:00:39.403 --> 01:00:41.171
Why is he trusting you
with it?

01:00:42.506 --> 01:00:44.842
Well, I'm Marvin King.

01:00:44.909 --> 01:00:46.744
Yeah. I'm your new neighbor.

01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:49.446
I was just
foolin' around.
Oh.

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:50.881
Nice to meet you,
Gloria.

01:00:50.948 --> 01:00:52.549
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

01:00:52.616 --> 01:00:56.420
Well, I'd just like
to welcome you and your family
to the neighborhood.

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:58.355
Thank you.

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:06.063
Unpacking
can be hard work.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.465
Yeah.
Yeah, it certainly is.

01:01:08.532 --> 01:01:11.001
I got a lot more
to do tomorrow too.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:21.178
Would you like to have
dinner with us tonight?

01:01:21.245 --> 01:01:23.080
It's just leftovers.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:25.582
Collard greens and corn bread,
some candied yams,

01:01:25.649 --> 01:01:29.553
a little potato salad,
fried chicken, peach cobbler,
few slices of ham.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:32.790
Mmm. Yum-yum.

01:01:32.857 --> 01:01:36.093
Yeah, I-I would love to,
Gloria, but, uh--

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.930
I just got too much
work to do here.
Maybe another time.

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.833
Yeah. Well,

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.871
to be honest, I don't have
no business eating it
myself, big as I am.

01:01:46.937 --> 01:01:49.639
Mmm.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.675
Yeah, well, my wife
was a big woman.

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:53.243
Oh.

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.112
I like that.

01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:57.882
I like a woman
with a little meat
on her bones, you know.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:02.286
Oh.

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:03.453
Well,

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:07.925
I could send a plate over
by my son Tarik for you.

01:02:07.992 --> 01:02:11.261
Great. Yeah.
I'd appreciate that.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:12.897
How old's your boy?

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:16.466
Seventeen.
Teenager.

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.235
He's gonna be leaving
in June,

01:02:18.302 --> 01:02:20.771
I think.

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:37.354
Excuse me.
What did you ask me?

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:41.325
I said, uh, Tarik--
Tarik-- he's going
to college, huh?

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.961
Oh.

01:02:44.028 --> 01:02:46.363
Um, he wants to
travel around the world...

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.398
with this organization
called Up With People.

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:52.269
I'm just not sure I--
Yeah. Let him go.
He's young.

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:54.104
Up with the people.

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:55.973
Yeah.
Uh, where's his daddy?

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:59.243
In California somewhere.

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.346
Look, um, Marvin.
I'll let you get back
to your work.

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:05.515
And, um,
I'll send that plate
right on over.

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:07.918
Thank you.
Thanks, Gloria.

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:10.420
Yeah.
Yeah. Nice meetin' ya.

01:03:10.487 --> 01:03:12.890
Hope to see you again
real soon.

01:03:19.329 --> 01:03:22.967
Oh, God, I hope he's not
watching me walk away.

01:03:24.234 --> 01:03:27.104
All right.
He's watching. Oh!

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:46.857
...grant the petitioner
$3,000 per month...

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:51.728
until such time as we're
fully able to review all
newly submitted documentation.

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:53.297
Next.

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:56.533
This is only round one.
Stay strong, Bernadine.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.602
Stay strong.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.605
Look. I want this to be over
and done with. Handle it.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.740
Let's just take it
step by step.

01:04:03.807 --> 01:04:05.609
It's taking a toll
on my kids.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:08.812
You sorry son of a bitch, John.
You know the mortgage
is 5,000 a month.

01:04:08.879 --> 01:04:11.015
How are your children
supposed to live, huh?

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:13.117
I told you to settle
for the 300,000,

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.119
but you want to
play hardball.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.354
All dogs don't
go to heaven, John.

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:19.689
You think you can
get away with this, huh?

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:22.792
You lowlife ass-kissing
Uncle Tom.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.629
You know, this--

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:29.466
This "Uncle Tom" stuff--

01:04:29.533 --> 01:04:32.903
It's really becoming
a bit redundant,
don't you think, Bernadine?

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:36.240
Excuse me.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:44.481
**

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.343
Scotch and soda, please.

01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:14.945
Yes, ma'am.

01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:21.385
Here you go.
Thank you.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.661
**

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:45.375
Excuse me.
Is anybody sitting here?

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:49.346
No. No one's
sitting there.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:54.251
Uh, cognac, please.

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:56.153
Yes, sir.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.722
**

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.170
My name is James Wheeler.
How do you do?

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:16.440
Your cognac, sir.

01:06:17.041 --> 01:06:18.708
Thank you.

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:30.520
So do you have a name?

01:06:35.092 --> 01:06:37.061
Bernadine.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.563
Bernadine.

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:48.305
My, this is a...
pretty place.

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:52.709
But I have to admit,

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:56.513
I haven't seen anything
as splendid as you
since I've been here.

01:07:01.585 --> 01:07:05.289
Okay. Oh, hold on now.
Hold on.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.591
You don't have to
give me that look.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.593
Just look.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.529
I haven't seen the sun
for four days now.

01:07:12.596 --> 01:07:16.600
I mean, it's been one meeting
after the other,
after the other.

01:07:16.666 --> 01:07:19.369
And now I am finished.

01:07:19.436 --> 01:07:24.508
So, I decided
to come downstairs,
have myself a drink,

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:29.113
and in the morning
I look forward
to returning home...

01:07:29.179 --> 01:07:31.581
to my lovely wife.

01:07:35.619 --> 01:07:37.454
Salud.

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:45.762
So, why are you
sitting here all alone?

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:48.798
Okay. Wait.
Hold on now.

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:51.301
You don't have to answer that.
You don't know me.

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:53.837
You know? I mean,
you don't know me
from a can of paint.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:56.506
Here I am, all in your Kool-Aid
and don't know the flavor.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:59.643
I'm getting a divorce,
James.
Ah. I'm sorry to hear that.

01:08:01.145 --> 01:08:04.814
Yeah, well,
it happens, huh?

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:12.322
And you know,
it just occurred to me
that, uh,

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:17.761
I've lost something
that once meant everything,

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.497
and it hurts.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:24.434
And right now,
I'm just-- I'm really
pissed about it.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:27.171
Mm-hmm.

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:29.606
But you know
what really gets me?

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:34.144
I didn't have plan "B."

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:38.314
My marriage
was supposed to last.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:41.185
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:43.553
So I guess that's why
I'm here. Hmm?

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.626
I can tell you one thing though.

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:51.428
Yeah

01:08:51.495 --> 01:08:56.899
Well, you are one
brave woman.

01:08:57.734 --> 01:08:59.502
You're bad.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.973
No.
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.577
I hope you recognize that.
No, I don't really
feel like that, James.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:11.415
Well, I mean,
you're sitting here
all alone.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:15.984
Ain't a black person in sight,
and you're sitting here looking
like everything is all right.

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.787
You know,
your makeup is flawless.

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:21.457
Oh, come on now.

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:25.694
I mean,
you've taken his best shot,
and you're still here.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.197
Mmm.

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.299
Splendid.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:31.368
You just know me so well.

01:09:31.435 --> 01:09:34.770
No, no, no, no.
I don't know you.

01:09:34.837 --> 01:09:38.642
But I do know a fighter
when I see one.

01:09:44.281 --> 01:09:48.885
And I could tell that
with one look in your eyes.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.692
What are you,
a, um--

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:59.529
a psychiatrist
or something?

01:09:59.596 --> 01:10:01.931
No. No.

01:10:01.998 --> 01:10:05.402
I am a civil rights attorney.

01:10:05.469 --> 01:10:07.704
My practice is
in Washington, D.C.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:12.742
I'm going through
something similar.

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:18.214
My wife is dying.

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:21.285
Oh.
Of breast cancer.

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.953
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.756
It's--

01:10:28.392 --> 01:10:31.628
Bernadine,
have you ever watched
someone dying?

01:10:33.897 --> 01:10:38.067
I tell ya.
I mean, watching her suffer
just kills...

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.937
a bit of me every day.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:46.676
And the worst part is
that I can't help but remember
all the plans we made.

01:10:46.743 --> 01:10:51.881
You know, like we were
supposed to retire
in Saint Thomas, you know.

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:55.652
Out there by the beach.
And she loves the water.

01:10:55.719 --> 01:10:59.856
Get the coconut oil
and rub it all over her.

01:11:04.561 --> 01:11:06.996
She is definitely a--

01:11:12.235 --> 01:11:14.804
I tell you, I just--

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:19.743
I just wish I could have
a piece of her that I could
keep safe, you know.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:21.945
Just something.

01:11:23.246 --> 01:11:25.515
Something more
than a bunch of memories.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.722
Anyway.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:37.026
You look like you're out.
Mmm.

01:11:38.395 --> 01:11:40.664
How about a, uh--

01:11:41.798 --> 01:11:43.733
a refill?

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.839
Yeah. Okay.
Okay.

01:11:49.906 --> 01:11:52.942
Uh, she'll take another
whatever it is she got.

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:55.379
Scotch and soda.
Ooh.

01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:58.314
I'm scared of you.

01:12:00.484 --> 01:12:04.521
* Everyone falls *

01:12:04.588 --> 01:12:08.091
* In love sometimes *

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:11.361
* Sometimes it's wrong *

01:12:11.428 --> 01:12:15.064
* And sometimes it's right *

01:12:15.131 --> 01:12:18.301
* For every win *

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:21.738
* Someone must fail *

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:25.409
* But there comes
a point when *

01:12:25.475 --> 01:12:27.343
* When we exhale **

01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:29.679
- Well, hello.
- Hello.

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:33.349
You look better
than I remembered.

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:36.586
It's funny. You don't.

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:42.025
But I guess you couldn't.

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:47.431
Oh, it's good to see you.
You too.

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:54.704
Well, I'm producing
my first segment.
Mm-hmm.

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:57.340
Uh, it's only
three minutes long,

01:12:57.407 --> 01:13:00.176
but it is a start.

01:13:00.243 --> 01:13:02.746
That's good.
That's real good.
I'm proud of you.

01:13:04.514 --> 01:13:06.483
All right, all right.
Let's cut the bull.

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:08.317
Are you gonna
talk to me for real,
or what?

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.754
You know, I have to apologize
for thinking I could just...

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.623
pop back into your life
after all these years.

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:16.125
"Pop back" in my life?

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:18.428
Yeah.
Oh.

01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:21.465
I needed to see you.

01:13:21.531 --> 01:13:24.534
All right. So you've seen me.
Now I can leave, right?
I can go.

01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:28.838
Oh, man.
There's so many things
I want to say to you.

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.740
Is that right?

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:33.342
Things I've wanted to say
ever since--

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:35.545
Well,

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:38.014
ever since you
dumped me.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:40.984
Dumped you?

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:44.420
Can we revisit the real world
here for a minute, Kenneth?
Yeah.

01:13:44.488 --> 01:13:46.823
You stopped calling me.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:49.893
Oh, yeah.
Well, took me a while
to get the hint.

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:51.628
The hint?
Yeah.

01:13:51.695 --> 01:13:53.563
What hint is that?

01:13:54.898 --> 01:13:56.900
You never called me--
I never called you.

01:13:56.966 --> 01:14:00.303
to go anywhere,
not even once.
Kenneth.

01:14:00.369 --> 01:14:02.271
You're the man.

01:14:02.338 --> 01:14:05.509
And that wasn't the nature
of our relationship,
and you know that.

01:14:05.575 --> 01:14:07.944
Mm-hmm. I know.

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:11.447
The nature of our relationship
was that I was in love
with a woman...

01:14:11.515 --> 01:14:14.050
who was too nice
to hurt my feelings.

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:18.622
You were in love with who?

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:20.957
And what?

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.458
Look.

01:14:22.526 --> 01:14:24.761
I know I'm married,

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:27.964
and I love my daughter
with all my heart.

01:14:30.366 --> 01:14:32.902
You see,

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:36.139
her mother was five months
pregnant when we married.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:39.976
Now that was my choice.
I went in
with my eyes open,

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:42.812
and I've lived with it
for seven years now.

01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:46.249
Now I don't want this
to come off like
some kind of come-on,

01:14:46.315 --> 01:14:51.087
but you are the only woman
that I have ever loved.

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.025
And I still
love you, Savannah.

01:15:15.712 --> 01:15:20.650
* And I can't believe
it's real *

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:24.888
* Can't believe it's you *

01:15:24.954 --> 01:15:29.392
* I can't believe
it's happening *

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:33.329
* I can't believe it's true *

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:39.903
* And I can't believe
that you are here with me *

01:15:39.969 --> 01:15:43.072
* And I am here with you *

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:45.074
* Kissing you *

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:47.410
* Softly kissing you *

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.613
* Kissing you *

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:52.248
* Forever kissing you *

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:54.183
* Kissing you *

01:15:54.250 --> 01:16:00.523
* Kissing you *
* You *

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:04.728
* I can't believe
that you took me *

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:09.198
* When I was choosing you *

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:11.868
* Kissing you *

01:16:11.935 --> 01:16:14.370
* Forever kissing you *

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:16.472
* Kissing you *

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:21.310
* Oh, gently kissing you *
* Kissing you *

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:25.915
* Kissing you *
* Kissing you *

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:29.986
* Kissing you *
* Kissing you *

01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:31.688
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh **

01:16:31.755 --> 01:16:34.557
You okay?

01:16:34.624 --> 01:16:37.193
Yeah, I'm just--
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.895
Nervous.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.798
Oh. I'm-- I'm a little nervous.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.269
Well, I mean, if you're
having second thoughts
about me being up here.

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.738
No, no. I'm--

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:50.974
I'm having
all kinds of thoughts.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:17:00.016
Well, I mean,
if it's any consolation,

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.617
Bernie,

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:04.654
I've never
done this before.

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:14.698
You sure?

01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:16.966
I haven't made love
to a woman
in over a year.

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:21.370
Lauren stopped
wanting to, so--

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.784
Um--

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.388
Look.

01:17:41.557 --> 01:17:45.261
I got two things
I want to say to you. No, no.
No. You don't have to...

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:48.331
say anything.
I do, because you may
kick me out afterwards.

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:55.839
Remember how you were saying
that the woman your husband,
uh, was marrying--

01:17:55.905 --> 01:17:57.841
I mean, ex-husband--

01:17:57.907 --> 01:18:00.443
that she was white?

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.078
Yes.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:05.114
Well--

01:18:07.951 --> 01:18:10.453
Well, so is my wife.

01:18:20.663 --> 01:18:23.466
Look, Bernie.
I mean, I can sit here,

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:28.037
and I can say that
the reason I'm staying with her
is because she's dying...

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:33.476
or that it's my obligation
or a whole bunch of
st-- stuff,

01:18:35.845 --> 01:18:38.114
but the truth
of the matter is--

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:42.986
I love her.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.891
She's the only woman
I have ever loved.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.798
And I would never leave her
under any circumstances.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.342
It hurts like hell.

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.347
Yeah.

01:19:33.837 --> 01:19:36.873
Someone felt that way
about me once.

01:19:40.576 --> 01:19:42.278
But he stopped.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.187
What do you
want to do tonight?

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:02.866
Make tonight beautiful.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.173
Beautiful.

01:20:19.082 --> 01:20:22.785
* I know if there is
any chance *

01:20:22.852 --> 01:20:27.356
* For us to find
our happiness *

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:31.861
* We've got to learn
to let it go *

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:36.632
* Oh, forget all the pain
we knew *

01:20:36.699 --> 01:20:39.435
* Sometimes *

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:44.307
* Sometimes
it hurts so bad, baby **

01:20:44.373 --> 01:20:47.610
Marvin, please eat
this sandwich.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.312
Mmm.

01:20:49.378 --> 01:20:51.180
Yes. Yes indeed.

01:20:51.247 --> 01:20:53.716
Ah, come on now.
I'm just kidding.

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:55.484
No, you weren't.
I wouldn't do that.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:57.486
You were not.
Can you hold that for me?

01:20:57.553 --> 01:20:59.889
Don't throw that
away now.

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:03.092
Ain't got no cheese
on this sandwich.

01:21:03.159 --> 01:21:05.328
You don't like cheese.
I brought the paint.

01:21:05.394 --> 01:21:07.730
Good. Sit it right down
there, Tarik.

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:11.200
You want a bite
of this sandwich, Tarik?
It got cheese in it?

01:21:13.636 --> 01:21:15.404
Here. Take a bite.

01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:20.543
**

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:31.120

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:36.926
Oh!

01:21:36.993 --> 01:21:41.230
* Happy birthday to you **

01:21:41.297 --> 01:21:45.134
- Oh!

01:21:45.201 --> 01:21:47.136
Thank you.

01:21:47.203 --> 01:21:51.007

beautician

01:21:59.215 --> 01:22:01.084
Happy birthday.

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:04.853
- Oh. Thanks.
- Weak!

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.957
Gloria, I hope
you find true love...

01:22:08.024 --> 01:22:10.326
and get you some
that's so electric...

01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:12.828
you ain't gonna need
no blow-dryer.
Oh, please.

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:17.266
And so juicy,
it's gonna put an end
to your 10-year drought.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.868
Oh!

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:22.538
Nasty. Ooh.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:27.443
Oh, come on, y'all.
Raise 'em up one more time.
Let's get serious now.

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:31.847
Girlfriend, here's
to peace of mind...

01:22:31.914 --> 01:22:35.184
and all the happiness
that your heart
and hand can hold.

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:37.886
'Cause Lord knows
you deserve it.
Aw.

01:22:37.953 --> 01:22:39.955
Oh!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

01:22:40.023 --> 01:22:41.991
Oh, thank you.

01:22:42.058 --> 01:22:44.527
Happy birthday.

01:22:45.394 --> 01:22:47.463
Okay. I can do this.
All right.

01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:50.433
All right. Now come on.
Make your wish first.
Make your wish.

01:22:50.499 --> 01:22:52.968
Um, okay.

01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.475
- Get serious! Go on.

01:23:01.177 --> 01:23:04.747
Oh, this is pitiful. Come on.
Let's help this old lady.
Just help me out.

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.150
You need some help.
Come on. Let's help her out.

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:14.323
* Love was always
supposed to be *

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:18.694
* Something wonderful to me *

01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:23.332
* To watch it grow
inside yourself *

01:23:23.399 --> 01:23:28.071
* To feel your heart
beside itself *

01:23:28.137 --> 01:23:33.242
* Sometimes it hurts *
Why do they write
these damn songs?

01:23:33.309 --> 01:23:36.745
To make you think
and believe and dream...

01:23:36.812 --> 01:23:38.714
you could feel like this?

01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:41.484
Hmm.
Shit.

01:23:41.550 --> 01:23:44.587
Somebody had to go through
this shit in order
to write it.

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:46.655
Don't you think?

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:49.325
* Sometimes the pain *

01:23:49.392 --> 01:23:52.861
* Is just too much *
Shoot.

01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:55.164
You know what?

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:57.566
You know what we all
have in common?

01:23:57.633 --> 01:23:59.468
What?

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:04.440
None of us--
not none of us...

01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:06.575
have a man.

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.814
Some sad shit.

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:18.421
* Always there inside of you *
That lying asshole.

01:24:19.622 --> 01:24:21.657
* Oh *

01:24:21.724 --> 01:24:23.559
Messed up my life.

01:24:23.626 --> 01:24:28.931
* Sometimes it hurts
to love so bad *

01:24:28.997 --> 01:24:33.068
* When you know you've
given it your best *
I should call him right now.

01:24:33.136 --> 01:24:37.940
* Sometimes it hurts
to even laugh *

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:42.745
* You feel a thousand miles
from happiness *
And I wanna talk to that bitch.

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.713
* Sometimes the pain *

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:49.652
* Is just too much *

01:24:49.718 --> 01:24:51.954
* And it hurts like hell *

01:24:53.989 --> 01:24:56.392
Hand me the phone.
I'll talk to that ho.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.361
Oh, wait a minute. Hold on.
Dial her number, Bernie.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.229
Wait, wait. Wait.

01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:01.964
Dial her number.
What are y'all doing?

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.566
- No.

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:05.868
Put the phone down.
Johnny

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.003
No, it's not John, bitch.

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:10.673
Robin.
Savannah, talk to her.

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:13.108
What happened?
Bernie. Bernie, don't do this.

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.578
Bernie.

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:18.281
Bernie, don't do this.
Gloria, I gave him
two babies,

01:25:18.347 --> 01:25:21.350
and she thinks
she can just take
my fuckin' husband.

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:24.520
Bernie! Bernie, cut.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.493
It's stupid.

01:25:30.559 --> 01:25:32.695
It's stupid, and it's childish.

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.699
Thank you.

01:25:39.034 --> 01:25:42.605
Gloria, I had some shit
I wanted to get off my chest.

01:25:43.339 --> 01:25:45.374
I'm hurt.

01:25:46.942 --> 01:25:49.345
Why'd you unplug the phone?

01:25:51.079 --> 01:25:55.318
Wh-What-- What happened
to the music?

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:58.020
I thought this was
supposed to be a party.

01:25:58.086 --> 01:26:00.423
**
All right. Come on, baby.

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:02.991
* Yeah *

01:26:03.058 --> 01:26:05.961
* Just keep it
on the down low **
Ah!

01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:08.564
**

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.969
You already know.

01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:16.939
I'm sick
of this shit now.

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:19.342
Wait a minute.

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:21.810
The one man
I love...

01:26:21.877 --> 01:26:25.448
is married
with a kid.

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:28.751
And there's my life
in one little
sad nutshell.

01:26:28.817 --> 01:26:32.555
Mmm. Men do leave
their wives.

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:35.624
At least he told you
he was married.

01:26:35.691 --> 01:26:38.761
Yeah, but, see,
I'm not your average
24-year-old girl...

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:40.996
who's willing to
wait around
and count the days, see.

01:26:41.063 --> 01:26:43.899
Mm-mmm.
Uh-uh.
I'm 33 years old.

01:26:43.966 --> 01:26:45.534
Ooh!
Good!

01:26:45.601 --> 01:26:48.904
And I still look good.

01:26:51.173 --> 01:26:52.641
I still look good.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.543
You do.
You do look good, girl.

01:26:54.610 --> 01:26:57.145
You said it, fly diva.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:59.682
Mm-hmm.
Freak mama.

01:26:59.748 --> 01:27:01.850
The hoochie-coochie diva.

01:27:01.917 --> 01:27:04.353
No.
All y'all go to hell.

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.855
Savannah, you know
you look good.
You look good, girl.

01:27:06.922 --> 01:27:10.259
Whatever happened
to the good old days?

01:27:10.326 --> 01:27:12.194
Oh.
Good old days.

01:27:12.261 --> 01:27:13.796
What good old days?
What good old--

01:27:13.862 --> 01:27:16.332
Jinx.
You know,
the days when...

01:27:16.399 --> 01:27:19.302
men actually
flirted with you...

01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:23.306
and-and-and asked you out
for a real date, you know.

01:27:23.372 --> 01:27:25.107
Where are they hidin'?

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:29.211
They're not hidin'.
They're too damn scared
to make a commitment.

01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:31.280
Mm-mmm.
They're with white women.

01:27:31.347 --> 01:27:33.248
- They're gay.
- Or married.

01:27:33.316 --> 01:27:35.984
- They're ugly.
- They behind bars.

01:27:36.051 --> 01:27:37.653
Got bad credit.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.756
Got little dicks
and can't fuck.
That's what it is.

01:27:40.823 --> 01:27:43.326
Or they got big ones
and still can't fuck.
Ooh!

01:27:45.428 --> 01:27:47.563
Wait, wait.
They want to spank it.

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.031
What?
They want to--

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.066
What?
They want to what?

01:27:51.133 --> 01:27:52.835
Now that's not
a bad thing, Gloria.

01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:54.269
Oh, Robin.
Come on.

01:27:54.337 --> 01:27:56.472
They're too possessive.

01:27:56.539 --> 01:27:58.407
They want you to be
their mama.

01:27:58.474 --> 01:28:00.208
And their daddy.

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:03.346
And they're ugly.
Baby, we already said
they was ugly.

01:28:03.412 --> 01:28:05.781
Yes. Good and ugly.

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:07.516
Inside out ugly?

01:28:07.583 --> 01:28:09.685
If you're ugly inside,
you're ugly outside.

01:28:09.752 --> 01:28:11.053
Inside out.

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.688
Geez. Who asked her?

01:28:22.598 --> 01:28:24.967
Happy birthday, Ma.

01:29:30.633 --> 01:29:32.501
Hi, Ma.
Did I wake you?

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:36.505
What difference
does it make?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.908
I'm up now.

01:29:41.276 --> 01:29:42.811
What's wrong?

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.649
Why you talkin' so low?

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:50.719
Savannah?
Are you there?

01:29:52.655 --> 01:29:55.991
Yeah. Yeah, Ma.
I'm still here.

01:29:58.193 --> 01:30:00.128
Nothing's wrong.

01:30:00.195 --> 01:30:01.897
How are things with you?

01:30:01.964 --> 01:30:06.134
Well, they cut my food stamps
to $57 a month.

01:30:06.201 --> 01:30:09.371
Ma, how the hell
have you been getting by?
What have you been eating?

01:30:09.438 --> 01:30:12.875
Oh, baby, see,
I knew you would
get upset,

01:30:12.941 --> 01:30:15.578
and I've been trying
to deal with it on my own.

01:30:16.812 --> 01:30:18.747
The check, it's--
goes so fast,

01:30:18.814 --> 01:30:21.484
and things are
so high nowadays.

01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:24.186
Ma, how much money
do you have?

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:27.490
Mmm. Sixty-seven dollars.

01:30:33.962 --> 01:30:36.298
Ma, be down at Western Union
first thing in the morning.

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:38.100
Okay?

01:30:40.869 --> 01:30:42.871
Baby.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:45.073
You know, Kenneth called,
and, uh,

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:47.776
he said that he was gonna be
trying to come out there, with--

01:30:47.843 --> 01:30:50.145
with him filing
for his divorce and all.

01:30:51.246 --> 01:30:53.415
Well, did he call you?

01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:55.751
N-No. No, he hasn't.

01:30:56.885 --> 01:30:59.955
Well, then pick up the phone
and call him.

01:31:01.056 --> 01:31:03.025
Because, Ma,

01:31:03.091 --> 01:31:04.760
I just don't know.

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:07.062
I don't know if I can
trust him, you know.

01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:09.798
Oh, girl, you're so crazy.

01:31:13.636 --> 01:31:15.504
Mama, do me a favor, okay?

01:31:15.571 --> 01:31:16.905
Yes?

01:31:18.373 --> 01:31:22.578
I don't care if it's a--
a knitting class
or a new girdle--

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:24.813
Anything.
I don't care what it is.

01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.583
You just pick up the phone
and you call me, okay?

01:31:29.151 --> 01:31:30.953
All right, baby.

01:31:31.019 --> 01:31:34.757
And only me, Ma.
Only you, precious.

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:39.127
Bye.

01:31:49.672 --> 01:31:51.506
Hi.

01:31:51.574 --> 01:31:54.943
Yeah, sorry I didn't call
after I got in.

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:59.615
Oh, continuous introductions
after a very long
and tedious meeting.

01:31:59.682 --> 01:32:01.516
I was whipped.

01:32:01.584 --> 01:32:04.553
Yeah. One thing is certain.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:07.956
I'm gonna have to come out here
a few more times
before this deal's in place.

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:09.558
Yeah.

01:32:10.458 --> 01:32:12.527
How's my baby girl?

01:32:12.595 --> 01:32:16.665
Well, you tell her
that her daddy loves her.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.735
Yeah.

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:22.370
Me too.

01:32:22.437 --> 01:32:24.006
Bye.

01:32:28.944 --> 01:32:31.680
Well, good morning.
Well, good mornin'.

01:32:31.747 --> 01:32:33.749
And how are you today?

01:32:33.816 --> 01:32:36.785
I'm here with you.
It's all good.

01:32:42.124 --> 01:32:45.460
Have your breakfast.
I'll be back.
I'll be here.

01:32:47.262 --> 01:32:50.265
**

01:32:53.435 --> 01:32:59.441
* Inside yourself it's bad *

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:03.178
This is gonna broaden
his horizons,
make him more worldly.

01:33:03.245 --> 01:33:06.815
He'll be fluent in Spanish.
I know that.

01:33:06.882 --> 01:33:09.752
I just don't see why
he has to go
all the way to Spain...

01:33:09.818 --> 01:33:11.820
when he's already
been accepted
at Arizona State.

01:33:11.887 --> 01:33:15.624
I'm gonna miss him too.
Who's talking about
missing him?

01:33:15.691 --> 01:33:17.793
Look. He's a man, Gloria.

01:33:18.794 --> 01:33:21.229
He knows what he wants.

01:33:21.296 --> 01:33:24.299
Be proud you raised him
that way.
I am proud.

01:33:24.366 --> 01:33:26.068
It's just--

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:29.204
He's my baby.
You just don't understand.
I understand.

01:33:29.271 --> 01:33:31.173
I un--

01:33:31.239 --> 01:33:33.742
Why you telling me all this?

01:33:33.809 --> 01:33:36.912
Well, I thought that since
you've been coming over
all these months,

01:33:36.979 --> 01:33:39.014
showing him how to
fix things--

01:33:39.081 --> 01:33:41.616
He's-- He's never known
what it's like
to have a father.

01:33:41.684 --> 01:33:44.252
You took him fishin'.
He looks up to you.

01:33:44.319 --> 01:33:47.022
I thought maybe
you could talk
some sense into him.

01:33:48.824 --> 01:33:51.994
It seems to me Tarik
isn't the one who needs to
come to his senses.

01:33:53.228 --> 01:33:56.164
I-If you don't mind
my saying so.

01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:59.567
Well, everybody's entitled
to their own opinion.
Good night.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.369
Gloria.

01:34:02.504 --> 01:34:04.139
Good night.

01:34:04.206 --> 01:34:07.776
* Feel so sad *

01:34:07.843 --> 01:34:11.613
* I thought I was over you *

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.482
It's getting late.
I better--
* But I keep crying *

01:34:14.549 --> 01:34:17.686
* When I don't love you *

01:34:17.753 --> 01:34:20.155
Good night.

01:34:20.222 --> 01:34:26.428
* So why does it
hurt so badly **

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.530
**

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:31.934
Russell called
and said he's leaving his wife
for sure this time.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.770
Okay. So what's
taking him so long?

01:34:39.775 --> 01:34:41.409
Russell?

01:34:50.452 --> 01:34:52.420
Russell,
what took you so long?

01:34:52.487 --> 01:34:54.656
I wasn't gone that long.

01:34:54.723 --> 01:34:58.160
* Some just learn it
on the way *

01:34:59.828 --> 01:35:01.730
Well, what happened?

01:35:01.797 --> 01:35:03.431
We talked.

01:35:07.102 --> 01:35:09.237
Well, I assumed that much.

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:11.073
So?

01:35:11.139 --> 01:35:15.878
* Make it smooth
Take your time *

01:35:15.944 --> 01:35:19.081
Is she gonna sign
the divorce papers,

01:35:19.147 --> 01:35:20.749
or what?

01:35:20.816 --> 01:35:24.652
You just don't decide
to divorce somebody and sign
on the dotted line, baby.

01:35:24.719 --> 01:35:26.922
It doesn't work that way.

01:35:26.989 --> 01:35:28.991
I wish it did,
but it doesn't.

01:35:30.993 --> 01:35:33.495
**

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:36.198
Why don't you get
my pajamas?

01:35:36.264 --> 01:35:40.869
Pajamas?
Now that's the first time
you ever asked for those.

01:35:45.607 --> 01:35:47.442
Russell,
did you sleep with her?

01:35:49.845 --> 01:35:54.382
I can't take comin' here
and bein' pressured about what
I'm doin' with my own wife.

01:35:57.953 --> 01:36:01.189
Well, you know we're not
gonna have very much time
to spend together.

01:36:03.091 --> 01:36:06.494
* Everybody knows
how to make you scream *

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:13.401
It's Troy.

01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:16.371
I can't talk right now.
What, you can't talk now?

01:36:16.438 --> 01:36:19.875
Hey, look. Why don't you just
say somethin' sexy to me
so I can go to sleep?

01:36:21.543 --> 01:36:23.378
Who was that?

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:26.381
Savannah.

01:36:27.883 --> 01:36:32.754
I suggest you tell
your boyfriends not to
call here after 11:00.

01:36:32.821 --> 01:36:35.958
He's jealous.
What a joke.

01:36:36.024 --> 01:36:39.027
What the hell
am I doin' anyway?

01:36:39.094 --> 01:36:41.763
* Said I shall not be moved *

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:43.798
**

01:36:43.866 --> 01:36:46.634
* Said I shall not be moved *

01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:51.439
* Just like a tree
that's planted by the water *

01:36:51.506 --> 01:36:53.375
* Just like a tree *

01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:56.678
This Up With People's choir
that's goin' to Spain--

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:59.047
is it this good?

01:36:59.114 --> 01:37:01.149
You mean the one
you won't let me join?

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:05.820
Nah.
* Shall not be moved **

01:37:05.888 --> 01:37:08.490
But they're close.

01:37:13.095 --> 01:37:16.098
After that selection,
after that song--

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:18.200
After that song,
somebody ought to say
thank you.

01:37:18.266 --> 01:37:20.268
Thank you!
Say "Praise the Lord."

01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:22.304
Praise the Lord!
Say "Praise the Lord!"

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:23.838
Praise the Lord!

01:37:23.906 --> 01:37:26.574
Turn to your neighbor,
right where you're sitting,
and say "The Lord"--

01:37:26.641 --> 01:37:28.376
The Lord--
"is blessing me"--

01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:29.577
is blessing me.

01:37:29.644 --> 01:37:31.213
"right now."
right now.

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:33.181
Amen.
Amen.

01:37:33.248 --> 01:37:38.620
At this time, our prayers go out
to Sister Lulu Mae Preston,
who just had hip surgery.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:41.423
Church,
I want you to know
this morning that...

01:37:41.489 --> 01:37:43.558
God is able!

01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:48.897
And because we know that
he's able, we will continue to
pray her strength in the Lord.

01:37:48.964 --> 01:37:50.966
Amen.
Amen.

01:37:51.934 --> 01:37:54.236
Sister Gloria Matthews...

01:37:54.302 --> 01:37:56.471
would like the congregation
to send their prayers out...

01:37:56.538 --> 01:37:59.474
for the safe journey
of her son Tarik,

01:37:59.541 --> 01:38:02.344
who'll soon be on his way
to Spain for a year...

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:06.915
to play the saxophone
in the Up With People
International Orchestra.

01:38:06.982 --> 01:38:09.217
Hallelujah! Amen!

01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:13.288
Amen. Oh!

01:38:16.224 --> 01:38:18.326
- Brother Tarik--
- Mm-hmm.

01:38:18.393 --> 01:38:20.895
Hold on to the Lord's
unchanging hand.

01:38:20.963 --> 01:38:25.033
As you go on your journey,
continue to trust in the Lord
with all your heart.

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.135
Amen.
Amen.

01:38:31.273 --> 01:38:33.341
I mean,
so what do you think, Robin?

01:38:33.408 --> 01:38:36.711
I've loved this man forever,
and now that we've got
another chance,

01:38:36.778 --> 01:38:40.048
I don't want to blow it
by making him think
I don't have any faith in him.

01:38:40.115 --> 01:38:42.117
Do you know what I mean?

01:38:42.184 --> 01:38:46.221
I mean,
don't we hear this on Sally
and Oprah every day?

01:38:46.288 --> 01:38:48.590
That's what you sound
like, you know.

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:52.127
Yeah, I know.
Is that where you get
your advice from

01:38:54.462 --> 01:38:58.066
Well, you know,
there was this one woman
in your same situation.

01:38:58.133 --> 01:39:02.404
Mmm.
This man kept saying
he was gonna leave too.

01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:05.140
She got her hopes all up
and everything,

01:39:05.207 --> 01:39:08.343
quit her job,
even moved to the city
he lived in.

01:39:08.410 --> 01:39:11.079
Right after
she got there,

01:39:11.146 --> 01:39:14.049
she found out she was
three months' pregnant.

01:39:14.116 --> 01:39:16.251
He ended up
dumping the woman.

01:39:17.719 --> 01:39:20.355
He said his kids would be
too hurt if he left now.

01:39:24.259 --> 01:39:26.094
So what about the baby?

01:39:26.161 --> 01:39:28.563
So she had an abortion.

01:39:29.931 --> 01:39:32.167
She never, ever told a soul.

01:39:32.234 --> 01:39:34.136
Not even her mama.

01:39:36.238 --> 01:39:37.605
Hmm.

01:39:37.672 --> 01:39:41.009
She never looked at men
quite the same again.

01:39:48.983 --> 01:39:51.086
So he left his wife
in the end, right?

01:39:54.489 --> 01:39:56.491
Take a wild guess,
Savannah.

01:39:59.127 --> 01:40:01.396
What show
did you hear this on?

01:40:01.463 --> 01:40:02.997
Sorry.

01:40:04.766 --> 01:40:06.734
I've never been
on Oprah.

01:40:08.770 --> 01:40:10.638
Where's my mom?

01:40:10.705 --> 01:40:14.176
I think my mommy left me.
Have you seen my mom?

01:40:29.524 --> 01:40:31.959
Guess what I got.

01:40:32.026 --> 01:40:34.562
Uh,

01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:36.398
some tea.

01:40:36.464 --> 01:40:38.333
Guess.

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.668
Picture you drew for me?

01:40:40.735 --> 01:40:43.171
I don't know, honey.
I give. What is it?

01:40:43.238 --> 01:40:46.508
I got the mail, Ma.
Oh, thank you.

01:40:46.574 --> 01:40:49.277
You're welcome.
I'll be right back, okay?

01:40:49.344 --> 01:40:50.678
Okay.

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:04.659
Hmm.

01:41:06.961 --> 01:41:08.563
Mama?

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:15.803
I've waited as long
as I could to contact you.

01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:18.039
Mommy, is "freak"
a bad word?

01:41:18.106 --> 01:41:20.342
I've been thinkin' about you
a lot, Bernie.

01:41:21.209 --> 01:41:23.178
Every day.

01:41:23.245 --> 01:41:25.280
All the time.

01:41:26.348 --> 01:41:28.883
I'm embarrassed to even
write that down.

01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:32.120
But... it's true.

01:41:33.188 --> 01:41:36.258
Bernie, I fell in love--
in one night.

01:41:36.324 --> 01:41:38.393
Mama, I asked you
a question.

01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:40.828
No, honey.
No, it's not.

01:41:40.895 --> 01:41:43.898
You know what's even harder
for me to understand...

01:41:43.965 --> 01:41:45.767
is that what I feel for you...

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:49.171
has never undercut
the love I have for my wife.

01:41:49.237 --> 01:41:51.806
Now how is that possible?

01:41:51.873 --> 01:41:53.908
Tabitha said
it was a bad word.

01:41:53.975 --> 01:41:56.043
I still watch her every day.

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:59.347
So beautiful.
So brave.

01:42:00.515 --> 01:42:03.751
I just wanna give her everything
I've got in me.

01:42:03.818 --> 01:42:05.287
Every moment.

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:07.889
It's-It's--
It's not a nice word.

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.757
She's hanging on,

01:42:09.824 --> 01:42:12.394
fighting to be here for me.

01:42:13.595 --> 01:42:17.699
And when she sleeps,
I cry...

01:42:17.765 --> 01:42:20.134
over how amazing she is...

01:42:20.202 --> 01:42:22.770
and how lucky I've been
to have her in my life.

01:42:22.837 --> 01:42:24.472
Can I say it?

01:42:24.539 --> 01:42:27.074
No. No.

01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:31.413
You're the only person
in this world I ever knew
I could tell this to.

01:42:31.479 --> 01:42:34.148
And even if
this never finds you...

01:42:34.216 --> 01:42:37.452
and we never speak again,

01:42:37.519 --> 01:42:41.723
you've... changed...
my... life.

01:42:42.624 --> 01:42:45.227
You know what inspiration is?

01:42:45.293 --> 01:42:48.796
It's someone who lets you know
life will go on...

01:42:48.863 --> 01:42:53.668
and something beautiful
can be waiting somewhere.

01:42:53.735 --> 01:42:56.838
Somewhere,
when you least expect it.

01:42:57.539 --> 01:43:00.107
Mommy, what does it mean?

01:43:00.174 --> 01:43:02.076
What does what mean?
Freak.

01:43:02.143 --> 01:43:04.812
It means "weird."

01:43:04.879 --> 01:43:07.515
You let me say "weird,"
so why can't I say "freak"?

01:43:12.186 --> 01:43:14.256
Because.

01:43:14.322 --> 01:43:15.890
Look, Mama.

01:43:15.957 --> 01:43:17.559
Mmm?

01:43:20.795 --> 01:43:22.697
Look at you.

01:43:22.764 --> 01:43:24.232
What?

01:43:24.299 --> 01:43:26.534
God stopped crying.

01:43:27.802 --> 01:43:30.505
I don't think those were
God's tears at all.

01:43:31.773 --> 01:43:34.809
Just his way of making sure
everything keeps growin'.

01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:49.190
Very romantic.
And the food.

01:43:49.257 --> 01:43:50.892
I love the food.
Mmm.

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:55.196
Oh! We have to start planning.
Your wedding.

01:43:55.263 --> 01:43:56.631
Hi, darling.

01:43:56.698 --> 01:43:58.533
So many plans.
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:01.503
Well--
My daughter's had a hundred
and four temperature...

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:03.571
for the past two days.
Really?

01:44:03.638 --> 01:44:06.308
Turns out
she's got the chicken pox.
Oh, gosh.

01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:11.279
I mean, Paula's been beeping me
on the hour, every hour,
all damn day.

01:44:11.346 --> 01:44:14.649
Mmm.
I told her all she had to do
was give the girl an ice bath.

01:44:14.716 --> 01:44:16.718
Right.
Or rub her down
with some alcohol.

01:44:16.784 --> 01:44:20.254
Mmm.
Jesus,
you'd think she had malaria.

01:44:20.322 --> 01:44:23.024
So why'd you even come?
Why?

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:26.794
Because you are the most
important thing in my life.

01:44:26.861 --> 01:44:29.497
Excuse me.
Can I get you something
to drink?

01:44:29.564 --> 01:44:33.100
No, thanks, for me.

01:44:33.167 --> 01:44:35.570
One of these days...

01:44:35.637 --> 01:44:38.005
she's not gonna have me around
to bug about this shit.

01:44:38.072 --> 01:44:39.807
Mmm.

01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:46.948
You know,
every trip I make out here,

01:44:47.014 --> 01:44:48.883
I dread going home.

01:44:50.151 --> 01:44:51.953
And the longer
I think about it,

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:55.757
the more I'm convinced
that this is
what I want to do...

01:44:56.591 --> 01:44:58.593
when the time is right.

01:45:00.395 --> 01:45:02.964
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:06.067
I mean, it's more financial
than anything right now.
Ah.

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:08.670
And there's still
a lot of things
that need to be worked out.

01:45:08.736 --> 01:45:11.573
- Mmm.
- I know if I left right now,

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:14.642
it would be the wrong time
for my daughter.

01:45:14.709 --> 01:45:17.612
She thinks she's having
a baby sister.

01:45:17.679 --> 01:45:19.447
A baby?

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:21.849
So,

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:24.719
we're going to have to wait
a little bit longer
than I expected.

01:45:24.786 --> 01:45:26.454
Yeah.

01:45:27.822 --> 01:45:30.692
But I know the kind of person
that you are...

01:45:30.758 --> 01:45:33.327
that you wanna do
the right thing as much as I do.

01:45:34.228 --> 01:45:35.663
Mmm.

01:45:35.730 --> 01:45:38.833
I do, Kenneth.
I really do.

01:45:40.402 --> 01:45:42.537
You see, the more
I think about it,

01:45:43.505 --> 01:45:45.540
the more I look at you,

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.376
you look like...

01:45:48.443 --> 01:45:50.445
the scum
of the fucking earth.

01:45:51.813 --> 01:45:53.715
You see,
the good news is, Kenneth,

01:45:53.781 --> 01:45:56.751
is that I was never,
ever in danger of you
getting a divorce.

01:45:58.119 --> 01:46:00.287
Oh, no. I'm the lucky one.

01:46:00.354 --> 01:46:02.824
"The most important thing"
in your life,

01:46:02.890 --> 01:46:05.493
meaning you'll abandon
your wife and your child...

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.462
to get laid
every chance I give you.

01:46:07.529 --> 01:46:10.031
And you think--

01:46:10.097 --> 01:46:13.935
you think the brass ring
is some bogus promise to put me
into Paula's shoes?

01:46:14.001 --> 01:46:16.671
So you can do the same
fucking thing to me next year?

01:46:16.738 --> 01:46:20.475
It's pretty close
to irresistible, lover man.

01:46:20.542 --> 01:46:23.010
What the hell's
wrong with you?

01:46:23.077 --> 01:46:26.714
I mean, you and my wife
working for the same
fucking firm or something?

01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:32.353
You weren't this
self-righteous when you were
fucking my brains out.

01:46:32.420 --> 01:46:35.423
You weren't worried about
my poor little wife then,
now were you?

01:46:35.490 --> 01:46:38.693
You're right.
You're absolutely right,
Kenneth.

01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:41.162
I couldn't see past
what I wanted.

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:43.531
So that made me an asshole.

01:46:43.598 --> 01:46:46.233
But the difference
between you and me...

01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.803
is I'm not anymore.

01:46:50.705 --> 01:46:52.874
Wait a minute.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is it?

01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.476
Now look.

01:46:55.543 --> 01:46:57.579
I'm sorry,

01:46:57.645 --> 01:46:59.547
but we need to talk
about this some more.

01:46:59.614 --> 01:47:01.649
I mean, without all the anger.

01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:05.252
Look. I'm not mad.
Really.

01:47:05.319 --> 01:47:07.955
Neither am I, baby.
I'm not mad.

01:47:08.022 --> 01:47:10.892
And to prove it,
the drinks are on you.

01:47:11.559 --> 01:47:13.528
Hey! Damn it.

01:47:13.595 --> 01:47:16.130
* Kissing you *

01:47:16.197 --> 01:47:18.800
* Kissing you *

01:47:18.866 --> 01:47:20.802
Excuse me, Savannah.
You have a phone call.

01:47:20.868 --> 01:47:23.471
Thanks, Edy.
Excuse me for a sec.
Hello?

01:47:23.538 --> 01:47:25.773
Have you lost your mind?

01:47:27.341 --> 01:47:28.843
Ma?

01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:32.880
Kenneth just called me
and told me how simple
you acted.

01:47:33.815 --> 01:47:36.484
He was actually cryin'.

01:47:36.551 --> 01:47:39.854
And men don't be cryin'
over no woman
unless they love 'em.

01:47:39.921 --> 01:47:42.524
How can you be
so insensitive?

01:47:42.590 --> 01:47:44.492
Could you excuse me
for a minute, please?

01:47:44.559 --> 01:47:46.594
No problem.
Thank you.

01:47:51.733 --> 01:47:56.003
First of all, Ma,
I am sick of you telling me
how I should live my life,

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:58.005
who you think
I should love, marry.

01:47:58.072 --> 01:47:59.607
Ma, I'm sick of it.

01:47:59.674 --> 01:48:01.442
Don't you raise
your voice at me.

01:48:01.509 --> 01:48:03.711
Mama, I'm 33 years old,
and I live alone.

01:48:03.778 --> 01:48:05.647
Mmm. Yeah.
Tell me about it.

01:48:05.713 --> 01:48:09.450
Yes, and I may have to accept
the fact that I may live alone
for the rest of my life.

01:48:09.517 --> 01:48:12.086
It ain't too late,
Savannah.

01:48:12.153 --> 01:48:15.089
He's begging on his damn knees,
and you're letting him get away.

01:48:15.156 --> 01:48:19.260
Mama, do you hear me?
I have a job.
I have friends.

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:22.096
Ma, I have interests that
you don't even ask about...

01:48:22.163 --> 01:48:24.165
because only one thing
counts with you, Mama.

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:27.334
With any damn woman
unless they lyin'
to themself.

01:48:27.401 --> 01:48:30.137
Well, I'm being honest
with myself, Ma.

01:48:30.204 --> 01:48:33.675
I'm smart, I work hard,
and I'm a good person.

01:48:33.741 --> 01:48:36.377
Ma, if I allowed myself
to think like you,

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:38.245
I guess I'd be a dead woman.

01:48:38.312 --> 01:48:41.082
Ma, you should be proud
I'd rather live alone...

01:48:41.148 --> 01:48:43.918
than crawl up behind
some two-timing loser
like Kenneth.

01:48:46.788 --> 01:48:49.223
He's a good man, Savannah.

01:48:49.290 --> 01:48:51.258
A good man.

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.062
He's just in a bad
situation right now,

01:48:55.129 --> 01:48:57.231
and he's trying
to get out of it.

01:48:57.298 --> 01:49:00.134
Mama, I tell you what.
Why don't you fuckin'
marry him then?

01:49:19.921 --> 01:49:21.623
Ma.

01:49:22.590 --> 01:49:25.059
I was wrong to yell.
I'm sorry.

01:49:25.126 --> 01:49:27.294
But I meant what I said
about my life.

01:49:28.462 --> 01:49:30.231
But I didn't mean
to disrespect you.

01:49:31.599 --> 01:49:33.801
I'll never do that again.

01:49:33.868 --> 01:49:36.037
It's all right, baby.

01:49:37.071 --> 01:49:39.006
It's all right.

01:49:40.174 --> 01:49:43.577
I just don't want to
see you end up like me.

01:49:44.345 --> 01:49:46.013
Alone.

01:49:47.749 --> 01:49:49.851
I know, Ma.

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:52.353
And I love you.

01:49:55.222 --> 01:49:56.991
I love you too, sugar.

01:49:57.058 --> 01:50:00.795
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:08.970
After fully reviewing
all the newly submitted
documentation,

01:50:09.036 --> 01:50:11.272
the settlement
will go as follows:

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:16.443
One and a half million dollars
in the Phoenix Municipal
Savings and Loan Association,

01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:22.884
ownership of the residence
at 1985 Ohio Drive
in Pinnacle Peak, Arizona,

01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:25.787
a second house
in Acapulco, Mexico--
Mmm.

01:50:25.853 --> 01:50:28.189
500,000
in stocks and bonds...

01:50:28.255 --> 01:50:31.625
and an E320-S
Mercedes station wagon.

01:50:37.131 --> 01:50:39.033
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:41.202
You're welcome.

01:51:06.928 --> 01:51:10.431
Did you hear that?
Whoo!

01:51:14.468 --> 01:51:17.104
Whoo-hoo!

01:51:26.447 --> 01:51:29.083
Hey, baby.
Surprised to see me?

01:51:30.484 --> 01:51:33.788
I finally got
that bitch off my back
like I told you I would.

01:51:33.855 --> 01:51:36.724
If that's what you want,
I'm happy for you.

01:51:36.791 --> 01:51:39.226
Then why are we standing here
in the hallway
talking about it?

01:51:39.293 --> 01:51:41.896
Because I haven't
invited you in.

01:51:44.732 --> 01:51:47.068
Come on, baby.

01:51:47.134 --> 01:51:48.469
It's me.

01:51:49.737 --> 01:51:51.973
It's Russell.

01:51:52.039 --> 01:51:53.908
Why you want to
do this to us...

01:51:53.975 --> 01:51:55.642
after all we've
been through, huh?

01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:58.780
Come on now.
I said stop.

01:52:01.783 --> 01:52:03.785
What you readin'?

01:52:03.851 --> 01:52:06.053
Childbirth Choices.

01:52:08.489 --> 01:52:10.557
What's that about?

01:52:10.624 --> 01:52:12.493
Yeah.

01:52:12.559 --> 01:52:15.162
It's yours.
And I'm keeping it.

01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:18.265
So what you expect
me to do?
What you do best.

01:52:18.332 --> 01:52:20.634
Disappear.

01:52:20.701 --> 01:52:22.669
Go home to your wife.

01:52:22.736 --> 01:52:24.772
Or better yet,
go get some help.

01:52:24.839 --> 01:52:26.740
I don't want anything
from you.

01:52:26.808 --> 01:52:30.677
I want you to read my lips.

01:52:30.744 --> 01:52:34.215
We don't need you
in our lives.

01:52:56.503 --> 01:52:57.504
Yes!

01:53:02.209 --> 01:53:03.845
It's open.

01:53:06.347 --> 01:53:08.382
How you been doing?

01:53:13.087 --> 01:53:15.389
I haven't seen
much of you lately.

01:53:25.499 --> 01:53:29.536
I, um-- I acted silly,
when all you did
was tell me the truth.

01:53:31.372 --> 01:53:34.141
I guess I didn't
wanna hear it.

01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:38.245
I've been real busy.

01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:40.915
Um,

01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:44.085
I came over
for two reasons.

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:48.890
I know I shut you out,

01:53:49.823 --> 01:53:52.526
and, um,
I miss you in our life.

01:53:52.593 --> 01:53:54.395
My life.

01:53:58.866 --> 01:54:03.704
Marvin, I have no doubt
in my mind everything you said
was true, and I-I apologize.

01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:06.307
I just came over
to say that.

01:54:06.373 --> 01:54:08.075
Wait a minute. Wait.

01:54:10.677 --> 01:54:12.779
Come on in.

01:54:12.846 --> 01:54:14.515
Sit down.

01:54:30.364 --> 01:54:32.266
He just left.

01:54:34.468 --> 01:54:37.104
He wouldn't even let me
take him to the airport.

01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:48.282
He's been the man
in my life, you know.

01:54:48.349 --> 01:54:51.618
My companion.
More than just my baby.

01:54:54.455 --> 01:54:56.023
Now he's gone.

01:54:57.424 --> 01:54:58.993
I, uh--

01:55:02.529 --> 01:55:04.365
I gave up, and I--

01:55:08.769 --> 01:55:12.639
a long time ago on any hope
I had of finding
someone for myself, and--

01:55:14.141 --> 01:55:16.978
It's a terrible thing
to do to Tarik.

01:55:17.044 --> 01:55:21.115
Tarik's gonna be fine. Yeah.
Yeah.

01:55:22.283 --> 01:55:25.119
I'm grateful to you though
for opening my eyes.

01:55:25.186 --> 01:55:27.921
I miss you too.
You, uh--

01:55:27.989 --> 01:55:30.057
You wouldn't allow
my fear of being alone...

01:55:30.124 --> 01:55:33.694
to get in the way
of him growing up and doing
what he has to do, and--

01:55:34.828 --> 01:55:37.398
I was so unfair to him.
No, no.

01:55:37.464 --> 01:55:39.366
Yes, I was.
No.

01:55:39.433 --> 01:55:41.402
You haven't been unfair
to Tarik.

01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:44.571
You've been unfair to you.

01:55:44.638 --> 01:55:46.173
To us.

01:55:47.741 --> 01:55:49.510
It's like--

01:55:49.576 --> 01:55:52.279
It's like you don't feel
you're worthy to have
someone to love you.

01:55:52.346 --> 01:55:54.148
No, I--

01:55:54.748 --> 01:55:56.250
I love you.

01:55:57.318 --> 01:55:59.053
I love you.
No, don't say--

01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:01.055
Yes.
You don't mean--

01:56:01.989 --> 01:56:04.158
Yes, I love you.

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.229

01:56:40.761 --> 01:56:43.630

our New Year's Eve countdown.
