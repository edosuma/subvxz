WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.403
So what's it
gonna be, Brian?

00:02.436 --> 00:04.405
You ready to become
somebody who matters?

00:04.438 --> 00:06.740
DENNIS:
Brian is lost in the world...
Don't move. Hands in the air.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.310
...and I can believe that
he is mixed up with this drug.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.844
Excuse me, everyone,
I'm robbing the place.

00:10.878 --> 00:13.281
REBECCA: Your dad used to be
an attorney, right?
BRIAN: Yeah.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.183
If you want to talk to him,
why don't you hire him?

00:15.216 --> 00:17.518
You made a deal with us,
but you're still entitled
to an attorney.

00:17.551 --> 00:20.754
Did you think Dad
was acting strange last night?

00:20.788 --> 00:23.157
I... think he's
a little suspicious

00:23.191 --> 00:24.558
about how you got here.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.394
Dad?

00:26.427 --> 00:28.262
It is dangerous if
I tell you the truth.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.731
I don't care.
I would die for you.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.400
There is a drug,

00:32.433 --> 00:34.235
and it's called NZT.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.707
And when I take it,
my brain is, like...

00:39.740 --> 00:43.211
Aw, Dad, I'd have to be on
it to describe it to you.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.646
Why don't you try.

00:48.182 --> 00:52.220
I'm the version of myself that
I've always wanted to be.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.323
I'm the version of
myself that you've
always wanted me to be.

00:55.356 --> 00:57.391
I'm unlocked...
We talked for...

00:57.425 --> 00:59.560
I don't know how long
it was, actually.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.229
I lost track of time.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.696
I told him a lot,

01:02.730 --> 01:04.832
but he's still in the dark
about Senator Morra,

01:04.865 --> 01:06.834
which is definitely better
for both of us.

01:06.867 --> 01:10.838
It felt so good to have him
back in my life in a real way.

01:10.871 --> 01:14.342
It felt good, that is...
right up until the end.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.777
Brian, we need to get
you out of this.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.180
Well, they kind of have me
over a barrel.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.781
That's the whole point.

01:20.814 --> 01:25.153
No. No, they want you to believe
that you're over a barrel.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.522
So let's just take a look
what's happening here, okay?

01:28.556 --> 01:30.391
You're the sole subject
of a secret

01:30.424 --> 01:32.660
and probably illegal
clinical trial.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.163
God knows what that drug
is doing to your body.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.697
I feel fine.
But you know
what, Brian?

01:36.730 --> 01:38.166
This is not gonna
work out well.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.201
It's gonna work out badly.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.236
Because nothing stays secret.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.539
And you're probably
gonna wind up...

01:45.573 --> 01:48.542
you're probably
gonna wind up in jail.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.711
Or if any those
guys whose...

01:50.744 --> 01:52.313
asses are on the line...

01:52.346 --> 01:54.848
think that they can nip
this problem in the bud,

01:54.882 --> 01:57.551
you'll wind up dead.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.288
Think of this as a ladder,
and you're at the bottom

02:00.321 --> 02:01.722
of this ladder.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.557
Once all this
information comes out,

02:03.591 --> 02:08.229
once it comes to light,
every rung on that ladder

02:08.262 --> 02:11.565
is gonna disavow
the rung below...

02:11.599 --> 02:15.169
and nobody is gonna give a damn
about Brian Finch.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.205
*

02:21.975 --> 02:24.278
(distant gunfire)

02:29.583 --> 02:31.319
Come on, what's
the hold up now?

02:31.352 --> 02:33.521
Aw, Dietz wants us
on that rooftop by nightfall.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.323
We keep getting
held up like this,

02:35.356 --> 02:36.924
we ain't never gonna get there.

02:36.957 --> 02:37.925
What's going on
up there?!

02:37.958 --> 02:39.860
MAN: Checking something out--
bag on the road.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.529
Let's go!

02:46.367 --> 02:47.835
(booming explosion)

02:47.868 --> 02:49.803
(debris clattering)

02:52.973 --> 02:55.209
(quiet laughter)

02:55.243 --> 02:57.211
Holy crap, man.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.380
You're really
a full-blown agent?

02:59.413 --> 03:02.916
Special agent,
thank you very much.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.953
(chuckles)
Congrats, brother--
you deserve it.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.758
They taking applications
from the... differently abled?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.895
Relax, man.
I already know they don't.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.797
You already have a job anyway.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.567
Packing shelves.
$12 an hour.

03:21.269 --> 03:24.305
Mm. At least Kristen's...

03:24.338 --> 03:26.574
pulling extra shifts
at the hospital.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.909
Only way we can afford
this palace.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.511
You're gonna find your thing.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.814
Seriously.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.256
(faint whirring)

03:45.793 --> 03:48.629
(chuckles softly)

03:48.662 --> 03:51.365
So you just think
and it moves?

03:51.399 --> 03:54.502
It's got a wireless connection
to my motor cortex, so I...

03:54.535 --> 03:57.371
I just think about
what I want it to do...

03:58.372 --> 04:00.341
(chuckles):
That's incredible.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.376
Not even the best part.

04:02.410 --> 04:05.513
Look, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

04:05.546 --> 04:09.417
Go ahead and...
touch one of my fingers.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.889
It's the ring finger.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.393
There are pressure sensors
on the arm and hand

04:19.427 --> 04:21.061
connected to my sensory cortex.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.331
So you can feel things?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.032
It's a brave new world, brother.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.635
Look, I...
I know you pulled strings

04:27.668 --> 04:29.637
to get me into the beta test.

04:29.670 --> 04:30.971
Thank you.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.640
I wrote a letter.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.808
After that, it was all you.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.010
(sighs):
Well, I was, uh...

04:37.044 --> 04:39.079
I was talking to Kristen
last night.

04:39.112 --> 04:42.450
I think I might...
go back to school,

04:42.483 --> 04:44.051
get a degree in teaching.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.787
Imagine what
those kids will think,

04:46.820 --> 04:49.557
new teacher walks in
the room with a Terminator arm?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.559
(clicking tongue)

04:51.592 --> 04:54.728
(faint whirring)

04:58.499 --> 04:59.800
*

04:59.833 --> 05:01.535
(phone line ringing)

05:01.569 --> 05:05.373
OPERATOR: 911. What is the exact
location of your emergency?

05:05.406 --> 05:07.875
I'm in my apartment.
I think she's dead.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.910
Kristen's dead.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.115
I think we should look into
24-hour surveillance.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.519
(cell phone buzzing)
Get Martinez on the horn,
make sure he has the resources

05:18.552 --> 05:21.689
to go round the clock.
This might be him.
This is Boyle.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.425
What?

05:24.458 --> 05:26.394
Wait, wait, wait.
Slow down.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.996
No. Tell me exactly
what happened.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.834
A favor for
Boyle, you say?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.403
Do tell.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.408
Okay. This is serious.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.876
Boyle served with a ranger
named Aaron Shaw.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.679
Last night, Shaw was arrested
for murdering his wife.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.416
The NYPD claims
he choked her to death.

05:48.449 --> 05:51.118
Aaron claims he didn't
do it. He has...

05:53.621 --> 05:55.923
...I guess what
you could call an alibi.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.591
What is it?

05:57.625 --> 05:59.393
The NYPD detectives

05:59.427 --> 06:01.729
who arrested him are apparently
laughing at his story,

06:01.762 --> 06:04.632
so... Boyle wants
to see if you can help.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.933
Well, what's his alibi?

06:05.966 --> 06:09.002
I think you should hear it
straight from Aaron.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.405
Hmm. Ike. Chaser.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.510
Hey, brother.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.481
So, this is the guy
I was telling you about--

06:20.514 --> 06:22.483
Brian Finch.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.118
He's good with...
complicated stuff,

06:25.152 --> 06:27.488
and I think he might be able
to help you out.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.023
Okay. (panting)

06:30.057 --> 06:31.425
What's going on?

06:31.459 --> 06:32.860
My wife died
last night.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.562
Kristen died last night.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.029
What happened?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.599
I was standing right there
when it happened.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.535
I watched the light...
go out of her eyes.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.504
So there was someone else
in your apartment?

06:43.537 --> 06:44.705
Did you try to stop him?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.774
It was just-just me and her.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.045
My hand was wrapped
around Kristen's throat.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.147
Then when
it was over,

06:54.181 --> 06:56.984
I called 911.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.690
I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw...

07:02.723 --> 07:04.692
it sounds like you're saying

07:04.725 --> 07:06.794
you killed your wife.
No. Look,

07:06.827 --> 07:09.229
I was attached to the thing
that killed Kristen.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.599
I didn't do it--
it was this thing.

07:11.632 --> 07:12.833
My arm.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.968
It went crazy or something.
It strangled Kristen to death,

07:15.002 --> 07:17.505
but I wasn't controlling it--
it was acting on its own.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.206
I tried to-to pry
the fingers off,

07:19.239 --> 07:20.608
I tried to-to power

07:20.641 --> 07:22.242
the thing down--
nothing worked.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.977
So you're saying
that you're innocent

07:24.011 --> 07:27.080
but your arm...
your arm is guilty?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.482
Yes.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.983
I know how it sounds--
believe me--

07:30.017 --> 07:31.652
but it's what happened.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.253
I did not kill Kristen.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.255
I would never kill her.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.558
It was my...

07:37.591 --> 07:38.726
arm.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.162
(faint whirring)

07:42.195 --> 07:45.198
*

08:06.754 --> 08:08.656
So you're saying
that your arm...

08:08.689 --> 08:10.558
came to life on its own?

08:10.591 --> 08:13.293
I know it sounds insane.
We-we were washing dishes.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.629
That's exactly what happened.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.598
And has anything like this
ever happened before?

08:17.631 --> 08:18.699
I mean, not like this...

08:18.732 --> 08:20.934
Never, not so much a twitch.
I would've told someone.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.637
I tried to pull the Jake arm
off-- that's what they call it--

08:23.671 --> 08:25.573
I tried to pull it off,
but it was...

08:25.606 --> 08:27.741
locked onto Kristen's throat
like a vice.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.544
(sighs)

08:32.145 --> 08:34.582
Aaron, is there
anything else

08:34.615 --> 08:36.316
you can tell us,
anything at all

08:36.349 --> 08:38.051
that can back up your story?

08:38.085 --> 08:39.787
I have no idea what happened.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.723
Maybe, uh...

08:42.756 --> 08:44.224
someone hacked it.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.193
Maybe it just went crazy
on its own.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.997
I need help.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.969
I get it, I do.
It sounds insane, but...

08:56.003 --> 08:58.672
I've been through a lot
with this guy, and...

08:58.706 --> 09:01.341
sure as hell the NYPD's
not gonna bother
investigating his story.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.943
I'll help.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.745
He's your friend.
I'll help.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.351
There's no way.

09:11.384 --> 09:14.955
In my opinion,
it'd be close to impossible.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.762
BRIAN:
Whoa. What is this place?

09:21.795 --> 09:23.230
We're called CRAFT.

09:23.263 --> 09:27.134
The Center for the Research
of Advanced and Future Threats.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.902
We were funded to
keep our military

09:28.936 --> 09:31.138
at the vanguard
of technology.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.140
Our job is to imagine threats

09:33.173 --> 09:35.142
that don't exist yet.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.647
We predict the way wars
will be fought in the future,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.649
and...

09:41.682 --> 09:43.283
we're ready
when the time comes.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.185
Is that a jet pack?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.788
It's not a jet pack the way
you're thinking jet pack.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.356
It's called
the Vayu Project,

09:49.389 --> 09:52.125
after the Hindu god of wind.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.161
It's designed to help
anyone in reasonable shape

09:54.194 --> 09:57.698
to run like a jaguar.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.032
That is awesome!

09:59.066 --> 10:01.368
Do you guys rent
that out by the hour?

10:01.401 --> 10:02.235
Nah.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.170
No.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.839
All right, let me see
if I got this right.

10:05.873 --> 10:08.008
So you guys invent
cool gadgets,

10:08.041 --> 10:11.178
and then you hand them out
to people to use on missions?

10:13.180 --> 10:14.782
You're basically Q.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.216
You're, like,
the real-life Q.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.350
Quentin, actually.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.252
Uh, but... it's
not the first time

10:19.286 --> 10:22.155
(clearing throat loudly)
that comparison
has been made.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.926
BRIAN:
That's because
it's totally legit.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.161
I mean, your name
even starts with a Q.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.863
So you really think
it's impossible

10:29.897 --> 10:32.666
for someone to hack
one of the arms you designed?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.068
I'm a scientist,
so I could never say

10:35.102 --> 10:37.204
anything is 100% certain.

10:37.237 --> 10:40.240
But in this case,
I'm willing to bet...

10:40.273 --> 10:43.176
almost everything I have
that the arm

10:43.210 --> 10:46.079
fitted to Aaron Shaw...
wasn't breached.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.948
How can you be so sure?

10:47.981 --> 10:50.150
Everyone knows that anything
with an operating system

10:50.183 --> 10:52.986
and a signal can,
in theory, be hacked.
(ringtone playing)

10:55.022 --> 10:56.323
That's why the arms
fabricated here

10:56.356 --> 10:58.425
use a wireless tech

10:58.458 --> 11:00.694
from a company called
Carreon Technologies.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.329
Their defense
strategies

11:02.362 --> 11:05.132
are deeply multilayered.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.101
We got the best
people out there

11:08.135 --> 11:11.204
to go after each of the 30 arms
in the beta program.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.241
Not one could make
an inch of progress.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.043
Excuse...
Hey, can...

11:16.076 --> 11:17.177
Thank you.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.915
I understand that you wrote
a letter of recommendation

11:21.949 --> 11:23.116
for Aaron Shaw

11:23.150 --> 11:25.953
to the beta program.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.387
I did.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.024
I wish I could tell you
that there was a decent
chance that your friend

11:31.058 --> 11:33.093
didn't murder his wife...

11:33.126 --> 11:34.995
but I can't.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.466
We-we hired the smartest
people on the planet

11:39.499 --> 11:41.201
to try to hack
this project.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.170
No one could do it.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.742
BRIAN:
"Smartest people on the planet"

11:48.776 --> 11:50.077
couldn't do it, man!

11:50.110 --> 11:52.112
Sounds like Quentin
just threw down the gauntlet.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.414
Spelman, I'm gonna prove
that there's at least a chance

11:54.447 --> 11:56.183
that your friend
is telling the truth.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.086
I'm gonna get past the security
on one of those arms.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.288
I'm gonna hack
the un-hackable.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.290
I appreciate
the help.
One thing.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.258
What is hacking?

12:05.292 --> 12:06.526
Seriously?

12:06.559 --> 12:08.428
Well, I mean,
I know in the movies

12:08.461 --> 12:11.031
there's usually a montage where
they play really serious music,

12:11.064 --> 12:12.499
even though you're
just watching somebody type

12:12.532 --> 12:13.666
really, really fast,
and then it says, like,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.936
"server acquired," and then
boom, something's hacked.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.370
Did it for the lulz,

12:17.404 --> 12:19.439
all that good stuff.
I just don't know

12:19.472 --> 12:21.809
what happens
during the typing part.

12:21.842 --> 12:25.278
Or even what the word
"hacking" means exactly.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.785
BRIAN:
So as it turns out,
the reason movies

12:31.819 --> 12:33.787
just show a montage,
they do it that way

12:33.821 --> 12:36.323
because hacking is boring.

12:37.825 --> 12:39.359
I mean, I could tell you

12:39.392 --> 12:41.328
about programming languages
or how I got in touch

12:41.361 --> 12:43.330
with Everywhere,
a hacker collective

12:43.363 --> 12:45.532
that schooled me
in basics, but really?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.500
Wouldn't you just rather be
watching some Vines

12:47.534 --> 12:49.536
of things blowing up instead?

12:49.569 --> 12:52.005
My new hacktivist friends
at Everywhere

12:52.039 --> 12:53.506
said there was
absolutely no way

12:53.540 --> 12:55.375
I could hack into
Quentin's prosthetic arm.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.846
But.. those guys were good
for the basics.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.481
I left them behind
with about a week of practice.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.316
Eventually, it was up to me.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.152
Well, me and NZT.
(rapid typing)

13:05.185 --> 13:08.521
I started timing my doses
so I'd get hack time at night.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.891
And finally,
after a bunch of time

13:10.924 --> 13:13.093
practicing
in between everything else,

13:13.126 --> 13:16.196
I think
I finally got somewhere.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.366
(knocking)

13:19.399 --> 13:20.834
(sighs)

13:21.869 --> 13:23.837
Dad. What are
you doing here?

13:23.871 --> 13:25.605
You haven't answered
your phone for days, Brian.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.876
I know. It's because
I was busy doing...

13:28.909 --> 13:30.844
computer stuff.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.280
So, do you remember
Rick Lindgren?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.116
We used to do pro bono work
for the ACLU

13:36.149 --> 13:37.584
back in the old days.

13:37.617 --> 13:39.086
So, he's in private
practice now,

13:39.119 --> 13:41.588
and he does work occasionally
with guys like you--

13:41.621 --> 13:44.424
people who work
for military contractors

13:44.457 --> 13:46.626
or law enforcement-- so...

13:46.659 --> 13:48.929
I told him about your situation.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.530
Dad...

13:50.563 --> 13:52.032
I told you that in confidence.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.101
I don't know what...
Why would you do that?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.003
I trust him, Brian.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.637
Rick thinks that

13:57.670 --> 14:01.308
there's a way for you to get out
of this contract with the FBI.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.542
How? I did those things.

14:02.575 --> 14:06.013
I ran from the police.
I held up a bank.
But you wouldn't

14:06.046 --> 14:07.915
have done those things
if you weren't in fear

14:07.948 --> 14:09.182
for your life,
isn't that right?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.418
You didn't know
who was chasing you.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.454
You didn't know if the guy
who killed Eli Whitford
was gonna come after you.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.556
You did all those things
under duress.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.625
What does that... does that mean
that they can't charge me?

14:18.658 --> 14:20.660
No, no. It means
that you'll have

14:20.693 --> 14:24.097
a legal defense if they do--
not to mention that drug
that you've been taking,

14:24.131 --> 14:25.665
which certainly interfered
with your judgment.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.534
Mm... that's not how NZT works.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.202
How do you know
how this drug works?

14:29.236 --> 14:31.138
Nobody knows how
this drug works,

14:31.171 --> 14:32.539
not even the government.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.208
Or they wouldn't be
using you as a guinea pig.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.277
And if they decide
to go after you

14:37.310 --> 14:39.446
for walking away,
we will see them in court.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.914
We will depose

14:40.948 --> 14:42.049
every last one of them

14:42.082 --> 14:43.917
and make them admit
that they are running

14:43.951 --> 14:47.054
a secret medical experiment
on a scared kid

14:47.087 --> 14:48.688
who actually hasn't hurt anyone.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.556
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:49.589 --> 14:53.093
I don't want to burn
the place down, Dad.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.461
Right.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.197
This is a fight,
Brian, a fight.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.466
You remember what
I told you about fighting?

14:59.499 --> 15:01.601
Mm... if I had
to get in one,

15:01.634 --> 15:03.937
to be sure to throw
the first punch. I get that.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.505
But...
That's right.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.274
You can be sure
they're gonna back off

15:07.307 --> 15:08.641
once they know
that we're serious

15:08.675 --> 15:10.443
about this.
But we're gonna need

15:10.477 --> 15:12.645
some real, tangible leverage
to make this work,

15:12.679 --> 15:14.614
so you're gonna have
to go on record

15:14.647 --> 15:16.516
with the details of your
agreement with the FBI--

15:16.549 --> 15:17.951
NZT and everything.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.619
On record?

15:19.652 --> 15:20.687
We need video.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.690
And we need the government
to know that we have it.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.326
Okay, so Rick wants you
to go to his office tomorrow

15:26.359 --> 15:27.160
and make the tape.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.529
I know it's scary.
Believe me, I know.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.731
This is how it's got to go.
This is the only way

15:31.764 --> 15:33.733
we'll be able
to get you out of this.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.037
When my dad said
he'd get me free of the FBI,

15:37.070 --> 15:40.307
I didn't think he'd
actually find a way to do it.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.342
(faint whirring)

15:51.751 --> 15:53.953
You hacked my arm.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.623
How?

15:56.656 --> 15:58.058
How did you do it?

15:58.091 --> 16:01.061
Well, Q, it wasn't easy,
I'm not gonna lie.

16:01.094 --> 16:05.465
Um... let's see, basically,
I started by...

16:05.498 --> 16:09.069
(emergency signal's blare
drowning out Brian's voice)

16:13.573 --> 16:15.475
That is how I
did it, my friend.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.344
And it turns out...

16:17.377 --> 16:20.247
your mind-control robot arm
is hackable after all.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.749
And it looks like someone
took advantage of that

16:22.782 --> 16:25.018
to murder Kristen Shaw.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.320
Who are you?

16:28.355 --> 16:30.723
Wow. That's...
(chuckles)

16:30.757 --> 16:33.026
kind of a complicated question.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.462
I like to think I'm
somewhat of a late bloomer.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.730
There are...

16:37.764 --> 16:39.532
a handful of minds

16:39.566 --> 16:42.469
out there who could do
what you did.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.238
What are you doing working
at an FBI field office?

16:45.272 --> 16:47.140
Well, I work at the CJC, man.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.808
It's not just
any old field office.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.610
I have nothing
against civil service,

16:50.643 --> 16:53.113
but what you do,
at its core, is...

16:53.146 --> 16:54.547
reactive.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.051
If you worked here,

16:58.085 --> 17:00.320
with me...

17:00.353 --> 17:03.723
the world would react
to what you did.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.261
Damn, man, that is...

17:08.295 --> 17:10.363
it's flattering.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.300
I'm not exactly
on the open market, though.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.469
The FBI has got me
pretty well... locked down.

17:16.503 --> 17:17.637
Ah-ah-ah.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.073
I'll give you
whatever terms you want.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.143
Jet pack privileges?

17:23.176 --> 17:26.446
We are living
in the age of marvels, Brian.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.548
A lot of that starts right here.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.284
Wow.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.685
It's tempting.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.155
It is tempting.
But I don't know,

17:35.188 --> 17:38.125
I got a pretty good gig
where I am-- the perks
are pretty great.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.592
I'll match it.

17:39.626 --> 17:43.430
Ah, see? That is the one
thing that you cannot do.

17:46.333 --> 17:48.168
BOYLE:
So if you

17:48.201 --> 17:50.170
could hack that arm,
so could anyone else.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.438
I wouldn't say anyone else.

17:51.471 --> 17:56.176
But yes, it is at least possible
that Aaron didn't kill his wife.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.411
Here's to hunting hackers.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.115
I think you guys should
take a look at something.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.583
NEWSMAN:
Earlier this morning,

18:03.616 --> 18:05.118
a U.S. Postal Service van

18:05.152 --> 18:07.554
swerved violently
across several lanes of traffic,

18:07.587 --> 18:10.190
causing serious injuries and
closing all southbound lanes.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.892
The driver of the van,
who escaped with minor injuries,

18:12.925 --> 18:14.261
is making bizarre claims

18:14.294 --> 18:15.695
about what caused
the 20-car pileup.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.131
WOMAN: I know what it sounds
like, but I'm telling you,

18:18.165 --> 18:19.132
it wasn't me.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.834
The arm just... grabbed
the wheel and took over.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.371
It was so sudden,
I couldn't stop it.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.139
It wasn't me.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.874
It was the arm.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.148
BRIAN:
So... the accident on the BQE,

18:35.182 --> 18:37.750
that wasn't the only arm
that went crazy.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.486
Not even close.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.321
(mechanical whirring)

18:43.390 --> 18:45.625
I'm s-sor...
I'm not doing this.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.627
This piece was influenced

18:47.660 --> 18:51.264
by Roy Lichtenstein,
the artist cited...

18:51.298 --> 18:52.565
(whirring)
(gasps)

18:52.599 --> 18:54.934
BRIAN:
Over and over again that day,

18:54.967 --> 18:56.436
people from the beta test
at CRAFT

18:56.469 --> 18:57.937
lost control of their arms.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.340
I have it on
good authority

19:00.373 --> 19:01.741
the reviewer from the Times
is coming tonight.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.244
So I want you guys
on the top of your game.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.545
(screams)

19:05.578 --> 19:07.714
You chopped off my fingers!

19:07.747 --> 19:10.783
So if I may coin
a phrase...

19:10.817 --> 19:12.419
it's basically

19:12.452 --> 19:13.720
Arm-ageddon out there.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.790
Oh, come on, guys,
that's basic.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.559
Arm-ageddon.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.893
Come on, that's...
We get it.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.696
I'll laugh later.
Promise.
Mm.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.365
Fortunately,

19:25.398 --> 19:27.567
CRAFT powered down the rest
of the prosthetic arms remotely.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.835
So the incident--

19:28.868 --> 19:30.570
whatever you want
to call it--

19:30.603 --> 19:31.638
is over.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.506
So now it's a case for the CJC.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.874
But if there is
someone out there

19:34.907 --> 19:36.376
that can hack into those arms,

19:36.409 --> 19:38.278
then God knows what
all he could do.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.646
So we will coordinate with Cyber

19:39.679 --> 19:41.614
to figure out
who did it and why.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.551
It's the "why" that
I can't get my head around.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.253
The attacks seem so random.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.620
On the one hand,
you've got the murder

19:47.654 --> 19:49.956
of Kristen Shaw
and a 20-car pileup,

19:49.989 --> 19:53.260
and on the other, you've got
a bunch of juvenile pranks.

19:53.293 --> 19:55.628
But the pranks suggest
a cyber-collective, no?

19:55.662 --> 19:56.763
Mm, I don't know about that.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.398
I mean, I spent
a bunch of time

19:58.431 --> 20:00.600
with Everywhere when they
were teaching me how to hack,

20:00.633 --> 20:03.470
and not any of them know how
to get past CRAFT's security.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.537
We've got a murder...

20:04.571 --> 20:07.340
and a guy who's pressing
a bunch of elevator buttons.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.642
The only thing that connects
the attacks is the arms,

20:09.676 --> 20:11.611
so the only motives
I can think of

20:11.644 --> 20:14.547
are to taint
the Prosthetics Project or...

20:14.581 --> 20:17.650
one of the contractors
that they hired.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.952
Someone with a grudge--
that means inside knowledge.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.654
Let's find him.

20:22.922 --> 20:25.692
BRIAN: So Boyle and Rebecca
interviewed everyone at CRAFT,

20:25.725 --> 20:27.527
along with all
the major contractors

20:27.560 --> 20:29.929
who worked on the Jake Project.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.998
While they did that,
I got the pleasure of reading

20:32.031 --> 20:33.633
all their employee files.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.602
But I kept one ear
on the interviews.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.570
It was an endless stream
of confused denials.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.572
After all, why would they
sabotage a project

20:39.606 --> 20:40.907
they'd all devoted years to?

20:40.940 --> 20:43.610
I was just about ready
to pack it in,

20:43.643 --> 20:45.044
and that's when I heard it.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.915
WOMAN:
Let me put something out there
and see if the cat licks it up.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.617
BRIAN:
Strange expression, right?

20:50.650 --> 20:53.386
I've heard it before.
Very recently.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.389
Do you remember when you were
watching Vines of explosions

20:56.423 --> 20:57.990
and I was learning
how to hack?

20:58.024 --> 21:00.393
I was talking to
the code jockeys in Everywhere,

21:00.427 --> 21:01.728
and there was this one user--

21:01.761 --> 21:04.297
the screen name
was BlackFlagBaby,

21:04.331 --> 21:06.633
and they used that phrase
all the time.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.570
Let me put something
out there and see
if the cat licks it up.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.572
WOMAN:
I'd love to help,

21:12.605 --> 21:14.774
but I don't see how this
came from one of us.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.078
Hey. Who was that?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.681
Ellen Kang-- she's
the head engineer at Carreon.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.751
They put the wireless tech
in those prosthetics. Why?
(cell phone ringing)

21:24.784 --> 21:27.554
I'm pretty sure
she leads a double life.
Excuse me.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.822
Okay, I'd be willing
to bet that Ellen Kang

21:29.856 --> 21:33.893
is also a hacker who goes
by the name BlackFlagBaby,

21:33.926 --> 21:35.762
she's part of Everywhere,

21:35.795 --> 21:38.030
and she's got some
pretty radical beliefs.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.832
You know, like anarchy
in the streets,

21:39.866 --> 21:41.634
rivers run red with
capitalist blood,

21:41.668 --> 21:43.636
all that fun stuff.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.472
If Kang really is...

21:45.505 --> 21:47.440
you said BlackFlagBaby...

21:47.474 --> 21:49.842
is she capable of pulling off
what happened this morning?

21:49.876 --> 21:51.077
I mean, I'd check
her computers.

21:51.110 --> 21:54.681
She could definitely be the
one behind Arm-pocalypse Now.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.684
Give it to me.
No way.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.119
That was Aaron Shaw's brother.
Aaron was originally

22:00.152 --> 22:02.021
denied bail, but based
on what happened today,

22:02.054 --> 22:03.656
he's been granted a new hearing.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.592
Now, it's a good
first step,

22:05.625 --> 22:07.093
but if we want the charges
dismissed outright,

22:07.126 --> 22:09.529
we need to find the person
responsible for the hack.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.930
Well, good news--
there's a decent chance

22:10.963 --> 22:12.665
you were just talking to her.

22:12.699 --> 22:13.900
(ringtone plays)
Let me explain.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.835
Brian thinks the woman
we were just talking to...

22:15.868 --> 22:18.838
BRIAN:
I didn't make the decision
to blow off my dad all at once.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.740
I just kind of deferred to it

22:20.773 --> 22:22.442
until I was home
in front of Sinbad.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.012
I texted an excuse
and shut off my phone.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.481
(object whistling through air)

22:28.515 --> 22:29.749
(explosion)

22:29.782 --> 22:32.819
I figure that'd buy me
a night of peace.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.654
(squeaky cartoon voices,
weapons firing)

22:34.687 --> 22:36.055
(cartoon character laughing)

22:36.088 --> 22:39.426
REBECCA:
Why did you turn your phone off?

22:39.459 --> 22:40.760
Oh, hey.

22:43.496 --> 22:45.732
I've been trying to get in
touch with you for two hours.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.734
Yeah, I've been dodging
a call from my dad.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.836
Isn't that what
caller I.D. is for?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.572
Well, in my experience, I've
learned that some situations

22:52.605 --> 22:55.742
are best weathered entirely
off the grid. What's up?

22:55.775 --> 22:58.177
You were right about Ellen Kang.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.178
Carreon gave
us access

22:59.211 --> 23:00.447
to her computers.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.614
We found the source code

23:01.648 --> 23:02.915
for the program
used to hack CRAFT

23:02.949 --> 23:04.451
right there
in her files.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.786
What, you just found it
out in the open?

23:06.819 --> 23:08.688
Well, she used
the same computer to log on

23:08.721 --> 23:11.691
to Everywhere-affiliated sites
under the name BlagFlagBaby.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.860
We have her in custody.
She's denying everything,

23:13.893 --> 23:16.429
but if we can get
a statement out of her,

23:16.463 --> 23:18.197
this will all be over soon.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.699
Hmm.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.668
Hmm?
I don't know,

23:21.701 --> 23:24.203
it just seems really easy,
doesn't it?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.705
A sophisticated hacker

23:25.738 --> 23:28.174
just leaving her code out
for us to find?

23:28.207 --> 23:30.743
Maybe she never thought
we'd come looking for her.

23:30.777 --> 23:32.745
I thought you could dig around
those sites tonight,

23:32.779 --> 23:35.715
see if there's anything else
that can link her to...

23:35.748 --> 23:38.117
You know you wanted to say
"Arm-ageddon."

23:38.150 --> 23:39.786
I saw it.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.554
I saw you almost say it.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.822
Just say it.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.223
...the crimes.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.793
Hey, what's the rush?

23:46.826 --> 23:48.461
Do you have
to be anywhere?

23:48.495 --> 23:50.129
It's, you know..

23:50.162 --> 23:51.798
beer o'clock.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.666
Or we have smokables.

23:56.068 --> 23:59.105
Which, as a federal agent,
probably doesn't interest you.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.009
What is it?

24:03.042 --> 24:04.744
Uh... what do you mean?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.145
You usually say "beer o'clock"

24:06.178 --> 24:09.682
when you want to talk
about something.

24:09.716 --> 24:12.218
(sets beer down)
I told my dad about all this.

24:12.251 --> 24:15.254
My gig at
the FBI, NZT,

24:15.287 --> 24:16.523
the whole shebang.

24:16.556 --> 24:20.660
You told me that I could hire
him as my attorney, remember?

24:20.693 --> 24:21.828
Mm-hmm.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.663
Well...

24:23.696 --> 24:25.765
he did not react
like I had expected.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.967
I mean, he thinks
that I need out.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.836
He thinks that

24:29.869 --> 24:31.137
he can make that happen.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.806
(sighs heavily):
I just have to...

24:33.840 --> 24:36.809
go on video and talk
about everything.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.779
Are you looking for a way out?

24:39.812 --> 24:40.913
No. That's the thing.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.915
I'm not.

24:42.949 --> 24:46.619
Well, just tell him that.

24:46.653 --> 24:47.854
I can't. We'll be back...

24:47.887 --> 24:49.956
I mean, he's so
gung ho on this.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.692
And that'll put us back...
right at square one,

24:52.725 --> 24:54.927
where things are
weird and...

24:54.961 --> 24:56.563
and estranged...

24:56.596 --> 24:58.197
No, this is different.

24:58.230 --> 25:01.768
Things were estranged
because you were lying to him.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.936
Now he knows the truth.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.906
That's right, I guess.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.611
Oh.

25:11.644 --> 25:14.914
You're not used to disagreeing
with your father, are you?

25:16.949 --> 25:18.317
Brian,
you're an adult.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.653
If he's gonna be
in your life,

25:20.687 --> 25:23.556
he has to respect
your choices.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.957
He'll come around.

25:29.962 --> 25:32.098
BRIAN:
She made it sound so simple.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.335
Almost as simple
as figuring out that Ellen Kang

25:36.368 --> 25:39.005
was the one behind Arm-ageddon.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.007
Ike, have you
spent much time

25:41.040 --> 25:43.576
thinking about the
idea of a patsy?

25:51.017 --> 25:52.919
I know how it looks.

25:52.952 --> 25:56.188
The code was on my computer,
but I swear I didn't do it.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.592
IKE:
I'm sorry.
He, uh,

25:59.626 --> 26:01.560
insisted I pass you this
right away.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.801
It was about the money--
quite a bit of it, actually.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.336
I mean, I just couldn't
get over the fact

26:10.369 --> 26:12.071
that catching Ellen Kang
seemed so easy.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.206
It was, like, too easy. Right?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.943
I mean, wouldn't she have
done a better job hiding

26:16.976 --> 26:18.611
or encrypting her work?

26:18.645 --> 26:21.147
It was almost as if we caught
the tail end of an alley-oop.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.950
So I started to wonder
if it was possible to profit

26:23.983 --> 26:25.818
from the events
of Arm-ageddon.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.086
I had a little look-see

26:27.119 --> 26:30.589
behind yesterday's
trading activities...

26:33.292 --> 26:35.061
Did you hack
the New York Stock Exchange?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.863
I just took a little peek
behind the curtain.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.164
No harm, no foul.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.032
Uh...
Okay?

26:40.066 --> 26:41.701
Okay. So,

26:41.734 --> 26:44.003
as you'd expect,
most stock of companies

26:44.036 --> 26:45.872
affiliated
with the Prosthetics Project

26:45.905 --> 26:48.007
took a huge hit
after Arm-ageddon.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.942
But the shell company,

26:49.976 --> 26:51.243
Eve's Mother,

26:51.277 --> 26:53.780
made a handsome profit
by shorting the stock

26:53.813 --> 26:55.314
of the conglomerate
that owns Carreon.

26:55.347 --> 26:57.083
About $40 million.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.686
It's almost as if
the person behind Eve's Mother

26:59.719 --> 27:01.688
knew what was gonna happen.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.723
Who's that?

27:03.756 --> 27:04.957
Normally it'd be
impossible to say,

27:04.991 --> 27:06.926
since the shell corporation
is based in the Cayman Islands,

27:06.959 --> 27:09.662
and by default not subject
to any of our laws...

27:09.696 --> 27:11.263
But you had
a little look-see?

27:11.297 --> 27:12.364
I didn't have to.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.200
Yesterday, when I read
all the employee

27:14.233 --> 27:16.969
and contractor files at CRAFT,
I noticed one of them

27:17.003 --> 27:19.038
had an application essay
that mentioned

27:19.071 --> 27:21.173
the applicant's
very first programming effort--

27:21.207 --> 27:23.042
Eve's Mother.
(taps keyboard)

27:23.075 --> 27:26.312
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Kenny Sumida,

27:26.345 --> 27:30.282
progenitor of Eve's Mother and
midlevel employee at Carreon.

27:30.316 --> 27:33.720
So you think this guy set up his
boss and made millions doing it?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.054
(sighs):
I do.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.823
Then he's Kristen's killer, too.

27:36.856 --> 27:37.924
Where is he?

27:37.957 --> 27:39.959
I poked around behind
Kenny's firewall-- he stole

27:39.992 --> 27:42.128
five different identities
over the past few days,

27:42.161 --> 27:44.997
and you know what
they all have in common?

27:45.031 --> 27:48.034
They all had flights
departing JFK last night,

27:48.067 --> 27:50.136
each to non-extradition
countries.

27:50.169 --> 27:52.104
That's why Kenny picked them.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.973
REBECCA:
Working under
your theory that

27:54.006 --> 27:54.941
he assumed
one of these identities,

27:54.974 --> 27:56.976
he could be
in any one of these countries.

27:57.009 --> 27:59.011
And then if you add in
connecting flights...

27:59.045 --> 28:01.113
He could be anywhere
in the world right now.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.983
Where in the world
is Kenny Sumida?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.389
BRIAN: So it turns out
the only thing worse

28:10.422 --> 28:12.759
than trying
to catch a flight at JFK

28:12.792 --> 28:13.926
is trying to catch a suspect

28:13.960 --> 28:15.962
trying to catch a flight
at JFK.

28:15.995 --> 28:17.363
The place is a madhouse,

28:17.396 --> 28:20.099
and finding Kenny Sumida
in last night's crowd

28:20.132 --> 28:22.501
really is like playing
Where's Waldo?

28:22.534 --> 28:25.504
I did spot three out of the
five passengers Kenny hacked,

28:25.537 --> 28:28.841
so that ruled out
three of the five cities.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.977
Okay, Kenny's headed
to Cape Verde or Dubai.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.245
Now, Cape Verde is beautiful
this time of year,

28:33.279 --> 28:36.148
but my guess is Kenny's
gonna blow some of his new cash

28:36.182 --> 28:38.050
in the shopping capital
of the world.

28:38.084 --> 28:40.519
We just heard from the passenger
who was headed to Dubai.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.289
The airline texted him that
the flight was canceled.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.291
(groans) I'll bet you
Kenny sent that text.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.393
Pause that!

28:49.829 --> 28:51.463
Hello, Kenny.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.901
Why do you think
that's Kenny Sumida?

28:54.934 --> 28:57.136
He's wearing a keffiyeh,
but he has the bottom corners

28:57.169 --> 28:58.370
tucked into his headband.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.972
That's not how they do it

29:00.006 --> 29:02.308
in Qatar, the Emirates
or Saudi Arabia.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.476
That is... made up.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.913
Also, he's wearing
New Balance shoes.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.915
Kenny just bought
super wide shoes online--

29:08.948 --> 29:10.449
Cyber told me that.

29:10.482 --> 29:13.485
New Balances are
the best shoes on the market

29:13.519 --> 29:16.789
for people who have wide...

29:16.823 --> 29:18.024
feet.

29:18.057 --> 29:19.491
Kenny.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.527
What?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.963
I have total recall,
and my brother has flat feet.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.465
Even if that is him,
that footage is from last night,

29:26.498 --> 29:28.434
so his flight would have landed
hours ago.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.203
We've got no legal way
to get him back here.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.406
What if we have a slightly...

29:34.440 --> 29:36.809
extra-legal way of doing it?

29:39.045 --> 29:40.813
Don't worry. I'm not hacking.
(rapid typing)

29:40.847 --> 29:42.148
I'm talking to my new
hacktivist friends

29:42.181 --> 29:43.883
in Everywhere about Dubai.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.184
It's a consumer paradise,

29:45.217 --> 29:46.919
located in one
of the most desirable

29:46.953 --> 29:48.921
non-extradition countries
in the world.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.257
But it's also one of the most
socially restrictive places

29:51.290 --> 29:53.826
in the world-- which makes it
easy to get kicked out of.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.228
Lots of people had ideas.
Toad To Hell.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.865
What if we frame him
for sleeping with
the prince's wife?

29:58.898 --> 30:01.868
We're trying to get him
deported, not beheaded.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.870
Andrew Jackson's Goiter
had a point.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.838
We had to zero in on a crime

30:05.872 --> 30:07.907
that would get Kenny deported,
not killed.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.176
(ringtone playing)

30:10.209 --> 30:12.611
Ah, not now.

30:12.644 --> 30:16.215
It took a while-- everyone
in Everywhere likes to argue--

30:16.248 --> 30:19.018
but eventually they got down
to the technical stuff.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.386
My mom always sends me Vines

30:20.419 --> 30:21.687
of kittens doing
really cute stuff.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.423
Here, you can look at those
while we get this sorted out.

30:24.456 --> 30:27.126
* Raindrops are falling
on my head *

30:27.159 --> 30:30.930
* And just like the guy
whose feet are too big... *

30:30.963 --> 30:33.465
When we were done,
we had settled on a strategy.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.635
Now, it had a few steps,
and it took a few days.

30:36.668 --> 30:40.106
First, we hacked a bunch
of digital ads and billboards.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.941
Then we Photoshopped
some pictures of Kenny doing

30:41.974 --> 30:43.309
a bunch of stuff you're not

30:43.342 --> 30:46.845
supposed to be doing
in the UAE.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.649
It's a really long list.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.618
So stage one was designed
to get authorities

30:52.651 --> 30:53.752
to take a look at Kenny.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.923
In stage two, we sent
a package in Kenny's name

30:56.956 --> 30:59.125
to every resort in the country.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.492
12 pounds of bacon--

31:00.526 --> 31:02.461
enough to be considered
intent to sell.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.296
And we also threw in
a few vibrators

31:04.330 --> 31:05.898
in each package.
(woman moaning)

31:05.932 --> 31:07.566
Now, I'm not aware
of any specific provisions

31:07.599 --> 31:09.568
against sex toys in the UAE,
(women laughing)

31:09.601 --> 31:12.004
but I figured, hey,
there's no way they're fans.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.974
The upshot? Within 72 hours
of those packages landing,

31:15.007 --> 31:18.144
Kenny Sumida was back
on American soil.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.579
Okay, so yeah, you got me
deported from the Emirates.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.681
I shorted some Carreon stock.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.650
Sounds like other than that...

31:24.683 --> 31:26.919
(sighs)
I should walk out of here.

31:26.953 --> 31:29.321
Kenny, we have so
much more than that.

31:29.355 --> 31:30.957
We have the source code

31:30.990 --> 31:32.558
from the hacking program
you tried to delete

31:32.591 --> 31:34.326
from your desktop;
we have the research

31:34.360 --> 31:36.662
that you did into the people
whose arms you hacked;

31:36.695 --> 31:39.365
we have the fact that
you stole the identities

31:39.398 --> 31:41.600
of five people heading to
non-extradition countries;

31:41.633 --> 31:44.303
and we have you,
who, frankly,

31:44.336 --> 31:47.573
in front of a jury looks like
a walking guilty verdict to me.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.708
REBECCA:
You're facing
charges of theft,

31:49.741 --> 31:52.144
assault, dozens of cyber crimes,

31:52.178 --> 31:54.646
and now the murder
of Kristen Shaw.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.682
You should have stuck
to pranks, Kenny.

31:56.715 --> 31:59.418
You care to tell us why you
added murder one to the mix?

32:01.453 --> 32:03.089
What happens if I talk?

32:03.122 --> 32:06.959
We tell the U.S. Attorneys
that you were cooperative,

32:06.993 --> 32:08.995
and it makes a
huge difference.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.972
Can I help you with something?

32:20.006 --> 32:22.975
Well, maybe you can.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.978
I'm looking for my son.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.615
Okay. I hacked the arms.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.318
I shorted the stock.
I set up Ellen Kang.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.386
But you have
to understand one thing--

32:34.420 --> 32:37.189
I did not kill anyone.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.425
REBECCA:
Why should we believe you?
(door opens)

32:39.458 --> 32:40.626
Your story's not
coming together.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.161
It's not making sense.

32:42.194 --> 32:44.696
Brian. You have
a visitor upstairs.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.568
Dad.
Ah.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.670
What's going on?
What are you doing here?

32:51.703 --> 32:53.739
You've been
avoiding me, Brian,

32:53.772 --> 32:56.975
so I thought I'd come
down and find out why.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.618
*

33:09.588 --> 33:12.724
I know when you're trying
to ditch me, Brian.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.593
I'm always
gonna find you.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.728
You think you'd
know that by now.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.564
I'm not avoiding you, Dad.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.566
(chuckles):
I'm avoiding this conversation.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.801
Well, isn't that
the same thing?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.270
No. No.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.139
Dad...

33:27.173 --> 33:28.774
(groans):
Oh...

33:28.807 --> 33:31.110
Okay. This drug--

33:31.143 --> 33:34.546
and this is gonna be hard for
you to get your head around--

33:34.580 --> 33:39.218
but... this drug, I think
it's making me a better person.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.123
I mean, it's a
work in progress.

33:44.156 --> 33:46.225
I'm still confronting my fears--

33:46.258 --> 33:48.727
the fear of confrontation
being one of them,

33:48.760 --> 33:52.198
and definitely the fear
of confrontation with you.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.633
Just say it, Brian.
Come on, out with it.

33:56.102 --> 33:58.404
I don't want to sue the FBI.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.506
I definitely don't want them
to sue me.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.742
Is it because
you're worried about...

34:03.775 --> 34:05.077
I'm not.

34:05.111 --> 34:07.579
No, I just...

34:07.613 --> 34:08.747
(sighs)

34:08.780 --> 34:11.283
As weird as all this is,

34:11.317 --> 34:13.819
I don't think I want out of it.

34:13.852 --> 34:15.354
I brought you into all this

34:15.387 --> 34:17.323
because I wanted you
back in my life,

34:17.356 --> 34:20.259
not because I wanted you
to rescue me from it.

34:20.292 --> 34:24.363
You are being held hostage
by the FBI, Brian,

34:24.396 --> 34:26.798
and you're telling me
that you're fine?

34:26.832 --> 34:30.502
As much as I can say
that about my life,

34:30.536 --> 34:32.371
yeah.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.140
Yeah.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.575
And people figure out
what they're supposed to do

34:36.608 --> 34:38.810
in all kinds
of weird ways, right?

34:38.844 --> 34:41.213
Yes, but there's
a difference between
Yeah.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.115
complacency and contentment.

34:43.149 --> 34:46.285
Now, what I can't distinguish
and what I am positive

34:46.318 --> 34:49.121
that you can't distinguish
is how much of this decision

34:49.155 --> 34:50.556
is being driven
by the drug.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.225
I mean, if your passion
is law enforcement,

34:53.259 --> 34:54.760
you can have a career
in law enforcement.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.562
No, I can't. Not like this.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.864
Yeah, because you want
to take the easy route.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.799
You just want to skip
honest, hard work.

35:00.832 --> 35:04.670
No, Dad. It's because the only
reason they want me is NZT.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.671
Oh, come on.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.340
That drug is what made me
someone who matters.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.776
Oh, please. You mattered
way before any of this.

35:10.809 --> 35:14.180
I can't show you something
that you don't want to see.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.315
I can't help you
if you won't let me help you.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.317
I don't need your help.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.252
I got this.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.323
Look, what I want
more than anything,

35:24.356 --> 35:25.924
what I've always wanted
more than anything,

35:25.957 --> 35:28.327
is to make you proud.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.562
If you don't agree
with my decision,

35:30.596 --> 35:34.366
if you think I'm doing
the wrong thing...

35:34.400 --> 35:37.869
I'll just have to find
a way to live with that.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.575
I'll tell Rick Lindgren
to stand down.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.349
All right,
at least I got the truth.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.650
Okay.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.321
All right.
Yeah.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.329
So between all three transfers,

36:03.362 --> 36:06.198
we're looking at a total
of $200,000?

36:06.232 --> 36:09.368
That would corroborate
his story.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.902
Thank you.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.671
Who was that?

36:12.704 --> 36:14.306
Long story.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.642
And I want to hear yours first.
How'd it go with your dad?

36:16.675 --> 36:19.411
Uh... can I fill
you in tomorrow?

36:19.445 --> 36:22.281
I'm, like, all talked
out for tonight.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.350
Yeah. Okay. Well, we just
spent the last hour

36:24.383 --> 36:26.252
getting a statement
from Kenny Sumida.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.288
Long-winded, but not
without a point.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.622
He recruited someone
from the Prosthetics Project

36:30.656 --> 36:33.392
to be a practice dummy
for the hack.

36:33.425 --> 36:37.229
Paid $200,000 to have
regular access to the Jake arm.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.730
Wow. So Kenny had an accomplice.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.866
A right-hand man.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.234
Is that, like, the same thing?

36:42.268 --> 36:43.769
I was trying to do a pun.

36:43.802 --> 36:44.870
"Do" a pun?

36:44.903 --> 36:46.872
Brian, the point is

36:46.905 --> 36:49.341
that his recruit caught wind
of what he was doing

36:49.375 --> 36:51.277
and he took advantage
of the timing.

36:51.310 --> 36:54.746
By blending in
with Sumida's army. Arm-ee.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.882
See? Short. Fun.

36:56.915 --> 36:57.783
It's reaching.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.351
Reaching. That's good, too.

36:59.385 --> 37:00.686
You're getting better.

37:01.487 --> 37:02.788
All right, Kenny's recruit.

37:02.821 --> 37:05.424
Was it who I think it is?

37:08.427 --> 37:09.795
It was looking bad for a while,
but I really think

37:09.828 --> 37:11.663
I have a good chance now.
Thank you.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.665
Congratulations,
Aaron.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.034
You made bail!

37:16.067 --> 37:18.570
Seems like a waste
of hard-earned money,

37:18.604 --> 37:20.539
considering you're gonna
be heading right back.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.808
What are you
talking about?

37:22.841 --> 37:24.976
We know Sumida hired you
so he could practice.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.478
What he didn't know was

37:26.512 --> 37:27.879
you must've wanted
out of your marriage

37:27.913 --> 37:30.048
and he had just given you
the perfect exit ramp.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.784
You killed Kristen,
then you blamed it

37:32.818 --> 37:35.621
on the mass hack.
That's absurd.

37:35.654 --> 37:38.457
Ah. Well, the one thing
I can't figure out...

37:38.490 --> 37:40.692
is why you did it
a day before

37:40.726 --> 37:42.394
the other attacks.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.396
She must have found the
money Sumida gave you,

37:44.430 --> 37:47.599
started asking questions.
You're gonna try
to prove that in court?

37:47.633 --> 37:50.769
My word-- a decorated vet--
against some hacker?

37:50.802 --> 37:52.938
Best of luck with that, buddy.

37:52.971 --> 37:55.607
Yeah, I have a blind
spot when it comes to
people I served with.

37:55.641 --> 37:58.310
Otherwise, I would have
figured out what you
are a lot sooner.

37:58.344 --> 38:01.713
(sighs)
But it's not just gonna be
your word against Kenny's.

38:01.747 --> 38:05.784
You see, at the scene of
every attack Sumida planned...

38:05.817 --> 38:07.719
there was a camera.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.555
The museum,

38:09.588 --> 38:11.723
the restaurant,
the elevator...

38:11.757 --> 38:13.592
even inside the
post office van,

38:13.625 --> 38:15.794
there was a security cam
on the dashboard--

38:15.827 --> 38:18.597
but at your house, where
you murdered Kristen,

38:18.630 --> 38:20.632
guess what we couldn't find.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.802
How in the hell was
Kenny Sumida supposed

38:23.835 --> 38:26.972
to control your arm if he
couldn't see what he was doing?

38:28.640 --> 38:31.076
Boom! Boyle for the win!

38:31.109 --> 38:33.011
Yeah, I don't think
your trial's gonna go down

38:33.044 --> 38:34.680
the way you think it's going to.

38:34.713 --> 38:37.516
Well, whatever happens,
in the meantime, have fun

38:37.549 --> 38:39.385
getting punched in the face.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.553
What the hell?

38:41.587 --> 38:42.921
I know, it's annoying, right?

38:42.954 --> 38:44.456
Man, my brothers
used to do that

38:44.490 --> 38:46.024
to me all the damn time.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.559
(grunts)

38:47.593 --> 38:49.428
I passed the code
I hacked your arm with

38:49.461 --> 38:51.763
to my new buddies
at Everywhere.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.599
Yeah. So if you hit yourself
from now to the end

38:53.632 --> 38:54.733
of the trial,

38:54.766 --> 38:56.435
that's just them saying hello.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.069
(grunting)

39:01.707 --> 39:03.442
Ah.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.744
Hello, Mr. Finch.
Agent Pouran,

39:05.777 --> 39:08.547
I promise you
this won't take long.
Mm-hmm.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.682
So, I think you know
that I recently

39:10.716 --> 39:13.084
have taken on my son
as a client.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.421
I'm a lawyer.
Oh.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.689
Should I be calling mine?

39:17.723 --> 39:21.760
We were considering legal
action against the CJC,

39:21.793 --> 39:24.095
but Brian decided
not to press charges.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.998
I suspected that he
would back down, so...

39:27.032 --> 39:29.401
I started filing
for conservatorship

39:29.435 --> 39:31.503
on the grounds that
he wasn't capable

39:31.537 --> 39:33.572
of making clear
decisions right now.

39:33.605 --> 39:36.475
So I should be calling
my lawyer.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.644
No, I don't want to expose
Brian to the courts

39:38.677 --> 39:40.712
if he doesn't want me to.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.014
And I figured I'd
have a better chance

39:43.048 --> 39:47.686
appealing to you as
one parent to another.

39:49.655 --> 39:50.556
You're familiar

39:50.589 --> 39:52.658
with the doctrine
of parens patriae?

39:52.691 --> 39:54.826
Mm-hmm.
The notion
of the state

39:54.860 --> 39:57.829
having an obligation
to act as a parent

39:57.863 --> 40:01.533
when dealing with those who
require special protection.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.969
The young and the mentally ill.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.871
And the drug-addicted.

40:05.904 --> 40:09.107
And no matter how you slice
it, that's what Brian is.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.443
By your hand.

40:11.477 --> 40:14.179
And if I don't have
the civil right to...

40:14.212 --> 40:16.682
take care of my son,

40:16.715 --> 40:20.786
and if my son won't
let me protect him...

40:20.819 --> 40:23.722
I need to know
that someone will.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.023
Well, we'll look after Brian.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.725
I will look after Brian.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.961
But, Mr. Finch, I think
you underestimate your son.

40:29.995 --> 40:31.763
From everything I've seen

40:31.797 --> 40:35.501
since I first crossed paths
with Brian...

40:35.534 --> 40:38.570
he does a pretty good job
looking after himself.

40:38.604 --> 40:41.740
Well, that's good and fine,
but let me be clear.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.909
If my son is hurt...

40:43.942 --> 40:46.812
or, God forbid,
if he's killed...

40:46.845 --> 40:48.747
I'm holding you responsible.

40:50.048 --> 40:52.618
I know who you are,
I know you come from money,

40:52.651 --> 40:54.786
and I know that people
like you tend to feel safe

40:54.820 --> 40:57.022
from the consequences
of their action.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.760
Examine that feeling.

41:01.793 --> 41:04.162
Get nervous.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.565
Because let me tell
you, Agent Pouran,

41:06.598 --> 41:10.201
if my son doesn't
survive this intact...

41:10.235 --> 41:12.203
you're going to jail.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.113
(knocking)

41:22.147 --> 41:23.815
Hey.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.917
Hey. Can you come out and play?

41:25.951 --> 41:28.920
What? What's going on?
I thought we were
done for the day.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.055
Oh, we are.
There's just...

41:30.088 --> 41:31.623
there's something
I want you to see.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.726
Oh, come on, Brian, I know
you had a really big talk

41:34.760 --> 41:36.027
with your father
last night, and...

41:36.061 --> 41:37.228
it's complicated--
complicated enough

41:37.262 --> 41:39.130
to make you want
to take a break

41:39.164 --> 41:41.166
from being a grown-up,
you want to...

41:42.768 --> 41:43.969
Come on.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.948
No way! D-Don't even tell me!
Is that what I think it is?

41:56.982 --> 41:58.917
Remember that guy
from CRAFT, Quentin?

41:58.950 --> 42:01.787
Yes!
Well, he came by the office
the other day to ask me out.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.622
Just, uh, coffee.
Not a big deal.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.256
But after I told him
I was seeing someone,

42:05.290 --> 42:07.158
he asked if I would
give you this.

42:07.192 --> 42:07.926
Ha!

42:09.628 --> 42:11.863
Q.
He said to call him if
you ever want to dabble

42:11.897 --> 42:13.331
in the interesting stuff
in your free time.

42:13.364 --> 42:17.603
And in the meantime, he
said you could spend the
whole weekend with this.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.037
BRIAN:
What?!

42:19.070 --> 42:20.872
That's amazing!
(laughs)

42:20.906 --> 42:22.073
Oh, my God!

42:22.107 --> 42:24.109
*

42:26.244 --> 42:28.246
*

42:35.153 --> 42:36.922
Whoo!
