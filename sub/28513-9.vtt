WEBVTT

00:08.296 --> 00:09.967
You have anyone
watching the town?

00:10.011 --> 00:12.762
I got a couple deputies
monitoring the trains.

00:12.806 --> 00:15.598
Horseback over the border's
the more likely way to go.

00:15.642 --> 00:17.475
Well,
she's not going to Mexico.

00:17.519 --> 00:20.812
What makes you so sure?
She wants blood.

00:20.856 --> 00:24.316
Running away isn't gonna
get her what she wants.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.151
Oh, morning.

00:26.195 --> 00:29.196
Where you been all night?
We were worried.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.865
Well, I got drunk.

00:30.908 --> 00:32.992
Did you now?

00:33.036 --> 00:35.453
What we did, that don't
shake off like it used to.

00:35.497 --> 00:38.915
Well, while you were
out drinkin',

00:38.959 --> 00:40.834
your daughter ran away.

00:47.217 --> 00:48.550
Jeannie?

00:48.594 --> 00:50.469
Come on. Open up.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.739 --> 01:09.281
Hey Daddy.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.536
Are you all right?

01:14.580 --> 01:15.829
I'm fine.

01:18.835 --> 01:21.585
Start talkin'.

01:27.302 --> 01:28.635
I don't know.

01:35.185 --> 01:39.396
I just...
I didn't wanna be here.

01:42.568 --> 01:44.318
I understand, Bug.

01:48.575 --> 01:52.035
I wanted you to grow up
in a better place.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.996
That you'd never have to see
the things I saw at your age.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.540
What kinda things?

01:59.253 --> 02:02.629
Your Uncle Phineas and I grew up
doing terrible harm to people.

02:04.174 --> 02:05.299
Bad people?

02:05.342 --> 02:06.342
Sometimes.

02:08.054 --> 02:09.845
The only thing
that let us sleep nights

02:09.889 --> 02:11.430
was the Colonel
whispering in our ear,

02:11.474 --> 02:12.765
telling us
it was normal.

02:12.809 --> 02:14.642
Well, it's not.

02:14.686 --> 02:16.853
This place, it's poison.

02:19.608 --> 02:22.525
You know...

02:22.569 --> 02:25.612
I think that's the real reason
you ran to Mexico.

02:28.242 --> 02:30.492
You just couldn't take
being here.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.334
Tell me the truth.

02:46.970 --> 02:49.346
Our family
killed the Garcías

02:49.389 --> 02:51.014
and we stole their land.

02:52.518 --> 02:54.643
If I hadn't taken Maria
across the border,

02:54.687 --> 02:56.770
she'd be dead too.

02:56.814 --> 02:59.356
I can't lie about it
anymore.

03:02.737 --> 03:05.488
Now...

03:05.532 --> 03:09.576
there's no way to bring
all those people back.

03:09.619 --> 03:12.036
So I'm doing one last thing,
to try and make it right.

03:15.626 --> 03:16.626
What?

03:19.546 --> 03:22.840
I'm gonna help Miss García
win her court case.

03:25.595 --> 03:26.677
And after that?

03:49.078 --> 03:51.203
Nt t that.

03:51.247 --> 03:53.122
Now, I don't know
where I'm gonna go next,

03:53.166 --> 03:55.207
or what I'm gonna do.

03:55.251 --> 03:57.543
A future with me,
that's a hard, uncertain road.

03:57.587 --> 03:59.587
Do you understand that?

04:01.424 --> 04:02.549
Yes.

04:09.975 --> 04:11.141
All right.

04:13.396 --> 04:20.151
Pack a bag,
and keep it hidden.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.791
She can't hide forever.

04:34.835 --> 04:36.043
We'll get her, Colonel.

04:36.086 --> 04:38.003
My men understand
the urgency...

04:39.757 --> 04:41.006
How is she?

04:41.050 --> 04:42.800
She'll be all right.
Why's he here?

04:42.844 --> 04:45.052
I'm helping your daddy
with something.

04:48.016 --> 04:49.807
She's in Dallas.

04:58.986 --> 05:02.738
She wanted me to meet her
up there, talk to her lawyers.

05:02.781 --> 05:04.948
Lobby of the Adolphus.

05:04.992 --> 05:06.867
6PM, Wednesday.

05:06.911 --> 05:09.370
Found it in my saddlebag. Huh.

05:09.414 --> 05:11.080
How'd it get into
your saddlebag?

05:11.124 --> 05:16.252
I don't know. Maybe she bribed
one of the vaqueros.

05:16.296 --> 05:18.379
You're both lucky
I didn't burn it.

05:32.021 --> 05:34.230
Am I going
to Dallas now?

05:36.442 --> 05:38.526
No.

05:38.570 --> 05:40.278
Dart.
Yes?

05:40.321 --> 05:41.946
Make a few calls,

05:41.990 --> 05:43.990
put a man or two
in that lobby.

05:44.034 --> 05:45.492
You're the boss.

05:47.537 --> 05:50.747
I want you and I
to stay close to home,

05:50.791 --> 05:52.791
keep an eye on things.

05:52.835 --> 05:54.251
Things like Pete?

07:21.137 --> 07:23.388
Hey.

07:23.431 --> 07:27.350
If we can't
beat the whites,

07:27.394 --> 07:30.520
maybe we could
live with them.

07:30.564 --> 07:32.397
I could wear a dress.

07:32.441 --> 07:34.066
You'd look like
a pea hen.

07:34.109 --> 07:35.526
Well, you looked like
a baby deer

07:35.569 --> 07:37.861
when you started wearing
your numupikapu.

07:42.452 --> 07:45.870
You can take me
to the white world.

07:45.914 --> 07:46.914
Huh?

07:48.750 --> 07:51.042
I speak the language,

07:51.086 --> 07:52.544
though maybe
I won't say nothing.

07:52.587 --> 07:55.755
I'll just let you
walk me around.

07:55.799 --> 08:01.553
I want to see
the looks on people's faces.

08:01.597 --> 08:04.390
Why are we talking about
the white world all of a sudden?

08:33.548 --> 08:34.548
Tiehteti.

08:45.811 --> 08:48.103
We found signs of buffalo.

08:48.147 --> 08:50.772
North of here, I think.

08:50.816 --> 08:52.065
We have to follow.

08:55.529 --> 08:58.114
Tiehteti, come on.

08:58.157 --> 09:00.074
I'm tired
of moving.

09:03.747 --> 09:06.456
You don't sound
like yourself.

09:06.499 --> 09:08.124
We need you.

09:08.168 --> 09:10.710
More months of hardness
ahead.

09:10.754 --> 09:13.380
Every warrior
has to do their part.

09:13.424 --> 09:15.382
So then what?

09:15.426 --> 09:18.010
We can keep running from
new things that are chasing us?

09:19.722 --> 09:23.390
Our people always move.
You know this.

09:23.434 --> 09:25.184
Do you like that?

09:25.228 --> 09:27.645
Never sitting still?

09:27.689 --> 09:29.772
Never having a place
you can call home.

09:36.615 --> 09:39.825
Every numunuu
has lost someone they love.

09:39.868 --> 09:42.202
Your sadness
can't be the end.

09:42.246 --> 09:44.455
You have to look forward.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.250
And hunt buffalo?

09:48.294 --> 09:50.336
Yes.

09:50.380 --> 09:52.380
And make arrows?

09:52.423 --> 09:53.464
Yeah.

09:55.218 --> 09:58.678
Help find another camp
so we can keep moving?

10:04.895 --> 10:06.019
Get up.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.272
Everyone's waiting
for you.

10:37.763 --> 10:38.721
Hey.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.056
Hola.

10:40.099 --> 10:42.391
Any luck?

10:42.435 --> 10:44.560
Turns out
it's not my imagination.

10:44.604 --> 10:46.938
The foreman
at Two Rivers says

10:46.982 --> 10:49.399
the old lady's man Eduardo
called him,

10:49.443 --> 10:51.901
told him
not to hire me.

10:51.945 --> 10:53.737
I have been...

10:57.034 --> 10:58.867
Blacklisted.

11:24.313 --> 11:25.395
No.

11:42.499 --> 11:45.625
I'd miss you.

11:48.923 --> 11:50.672
What'd you do,
anyway?

11:50.716 --> 11:52.466
Hmm?

11:52.510 --> 11:53.968
To the old lady.

11:55.513 --> 11:57.013
It's one thing
to fire you,

11:57.056 --> 12:00.349
but why have her man
spread lies about you?

12:00.393 --> 12:03.811
It's... I dunno...
Rencoroso.

12:03.855 --> 12:07.983
I was asking too many questions
about my grandfather,

12:08.026 --> 12:09.526
Peter McCullough.

12:09.570 --> 12:11.069
As in...?

12:14.700 --> 12:18.369
Baby, you got about as much
McCullough blood in you as I do.

12:18.412 --> 12:21.038
I'm telling the truth.

12:21.082 --> 12:24.375
Jeanne Anne McCullough's father
is my grandfather.

12:28.423 --> 12:30.924
You're serious.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.176
I was working my way
up to tell her.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.679
Well,
it's good you didn't.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.514
If she thought
you were sniffing around

12:37.558 --> 12:39.349
after all that oil money,

12:39.393 --> 12:42.269
she'd have done a lot worse
than fire you.

12:42.313 --> 12:44.605
You don't know her.

12:44.649 --> 12:47.191
Do you have any idea
how many Mexicans

12:47.235 --> 12:50.361
her people have buried
on that ranch?

12:50.405 --> 12:53.906
Her people are my people.

12:53.950 --> 12:55.575
And that's my ranch.

12:56.995 --> 12:59.746
That's some dangerous talk
there.

12:59.790 --> 13:02.416
I promised my Abuela Maria
before she died

13:02.459 --> 13:04.710
that I would come here.

13:04.753 --> 13:07.045
That I would walk
on her land,

13:07.089 --> 13:11.258
land that has been in her family
for 200 years.

13:11.302 --> 13:13.219
She wanted me to see it
with my own eyes,

13:13.262 --> 13:17.724
to learn the sounds,
the smells.

13:18.935 --> 13:20.894
Well,
you did that much.

13:20.937 --> 13:22.437
It's not enough.

13:24.274 --> 13:27.901
I know that she would've
wanted me to fight.

13:36.370 --> 13:38.537
Mm-hmm.

13:40.041 --> 13:42.500
You heard something?

13:42.544 --> 13:44.335
Yes, I thought.

13:44.379 --> 13:47.213
There's a bobcat
that comes around.

13:48.675 --> 13:50.342
We can't wait here
forever.

13:51.637 --> 13:54.262
Endicott is sending men.

13:54.306 --> 13:55.347
Yeah.

13:55.391 --> 13:56.932
That's all well and good,

13:56.976 --> 14:00.603
but I wonder what they'll find
when they get here.

14:00.646 --> 14:01.979
What do you mean?

14:02.023 --> 14:04.607
What if the McCulloughs
get here first?

14:04.651 --> 14:06.442
Oh, they don't know
this place.

14:06.486 --> 14:07.777
One of them does.

14:07.821 --> 14:09.112
He wouldn't.

14:09.155 --> 14:12.657
If the Colonel
pushes him hard enough,

14:12.701 --> 14:15.076
trots out
the wife and kids?

14:16.705 --> 14:17.871
Who knows what he'll do?

14:17.915 --> 14:20.040
Do you have to do that?

14:20.084 --> 14:21.291
Do what?

14:21.335 --> 14:24.378
Expect the worst
of folks.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.130
I'm being realistic.

14:26.173 --> 14:29.884
Well, I don't like it.

14:29.927 --> 14:33.054
Bad outlooks
beget bad outcomes.

14:34.432 --> 14:36.766
Why are you doing this
anyway?

14:38.353 --> 14:40.061
What are you hoping
to get out of it?

14:42.107 --> 14:47.820
Well, a job working
for Standard, for starters.

14:47.863 --> 14:49.571
Keeping you alive,
like I've done,

14:49.615 --> 14:52.324
keeps Mr. Endicott's lawsuit
alive.

14:52.368 --> 14:54.326
He's liable
to be grateful.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.829
And if everything
lines up just right,

14:56.873 --> 14:58.831
I might earn enough
to build myself

14:58.875 --> 15:03.378
a fine limestone house
on this very spot.

15:06.091 --> 15:07.591
Get married again.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.678
You...

15:14.141 --> 15:17.726
You could have
a brand new start again too.

15:17.770 --> 15:19.228
If you wanted it.

15:23.651 --> 15:26.069
I'll never have
another family.

15:54.559 --> 15:55.559
Hi.

16:02.943 --> 16:03.984
We should talk.

16:06.697 --> 16:08.322
About what you saw.

16:13.037 --> 16:15.413
It'd be normal
if you hate me a little.

16:21.546 --> 16:22.712
I don't.

16:26.593 --> 16:28.343
You and Daddy
don't love each other.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.845
It's been plain awhile.

16:29.889 --> 16:32.222
You say it
like it doesn't hurt you.

16:34.101 --> 16:35.976
Can't change it.

16:36.020 --> 16:39.647
Honey, I wish I could.

16:39.691 --> 16:41.107
God, it would be easier

16:41.151 --> 16:44.777
if your father and I
were right for each other.

16:44.821 --> 16:48.698
Honey, I spent a lot of years
trying to make that so.

16:50.244 --> 16:52.160
I don't know
how to spend one more.

17:05.385 --> 17:08.678
I know being a mother
is all I am to you.

17:10.515 --> 17:14.267
But there are other pieces
of who I am.

17:14.310 --> 17:17.813
And those pieces,
they've been missing,

17:17.856 --> 17:21.191
broken for awhile.

17:21.234 --> 17:23.444
And I'm trying
to get 'em back.

17:23.487 --> 17:28.115
You gonna go off wandering,
looking for some other family?

17:29.953 --> 17:31.494
No.

17:31.538 --> 17:33.663
Honey.

17:33.707 --> 17:34.914
No.

17:36.918 --> 17:42.255
Men get to go off
and chase their dreams

17:42.299 --> 17:45.008
and make mistakes
that no one will ever see.

17:47.722 --> 17:50.055
And we have to stay here

17:50.099 --> 17:52.975
and make mistakes
in front of the people we love.

17:56.272 --> 17:58.356
Or at least I do.

18:00.235 --> 18:03.903
And I hope when you're my age,
the world is kinder.

18:10.162 --> 18:11.537
My child.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.281
Have some buffalo.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.741
No.

18:46.784 --> 18:49.077
Come on,
you need to eat.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.954
I don't want it.

18:53.959 --> 18:57.002
I know Toshaway
came to talk to you.

18:57.045 --> 18:59.046
I know he said things.

18:59.089 --> 19:00.589
Tough things.

19:00.633 --> 19:03.634
Things he thinks
you need to hear.

19:03.677 --> 19:06.387
I don't think anyone knows
what you need to hear.

19:07.890 --> 19:10.892
Toshaway is
a great chief.

19:10.935 --> 19:13.478
He doesn't know
everything.

19:13.521 --> 19:16.481
Do what you have to.

19:16.525 --> 19:17.816
Now, here.

19:17.859 --> 19:19.693
You eat some,
I'll eat the rest.

19:24.658 --> 19:26.283
Why'd we stop?

20:09.206 --> 20:10.914
Hey asshole.

20:17.673 --> 20:19.131
Hey.

20:19.175 --> 20:21.091
Hey, come on, now.
Come...

20:22.094 --> 20:23.677
Oh, shit.

20:25.264 --> 20:26.430
Not again.

20:26.474 --> 20:27.807
Who are you?

20:27.851 --> 20:30.268
Your English
is good.

20:30.311 --> 20:31.769
Better than yours.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.815
Looking for this?

20:35.859 --> 20:38.193
Oh, no. That thing's
a piece of shit.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.112
Only works
half the time.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.532
This... This, my friend,
works every ti...

20:44.618 --> 20:46.201
Awww come on.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.912
White man,
we're gonna kill you.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.330
Torture you first.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.831
Aw, don't do that.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.792
My people already think
you're savages.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.461
Why give 'em
any more fodder?

20:55.505 --> 21:01.968
By the way, your English,
also very good.

21:02.012 --> 21:05.347
Answer my questions
and I'll kill you quick.

21:05.391 --> 21:08.350
Well,
progress is progress.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.145
What questions?

21:11.188 --> 21:12.771
How many of you
are there?

21:15.067 --> 21:16.108
He asked you a question.

21:16.152 --> 21:17.443
I was thinking.

21:20.365 --> 21:22.573
I don't know, there are about
a dozen or so in my group.

21:22.617 --> 21:25.368
But there are
hundreds of groups of us

21:25.412 --> 21:27.871
scattered all across
the damn state.

21:27.915 --> 21:29.372
How far?

21:29.416 --> 21:32.459
Well, I can't really tell
exactly 'cause, sorry.

21:32.503 --> 21:35.254
But I get to walkin'
when I drink,

21:35.297 --> 21:37.506
but if I'm not mistaken

21:37.550 --> 21:40.259
I think we made camp
a couple miles due east.

21:40.303 --> 21:42.720
You sell out your people
real fast, Mister.

21:42.764 --> 21:44.096
Captain.

21:46.434 --> 21:48.017
Hey, are you white?

21:49.980 --> 21:52.939
Oh, you are, aren't you?

21:55.402 --> 21:57.319
You know
what you're worth, son?

21:57.363 --> 22:00.989
Anything else I need to know
before my friend kills you?

22:01.033 --> 22:02.219
I think
it's about ten o'clock.

22:02.243 --> 22:03.492
Nocona.

22:03.536 --> 22:05.453
Which means.

22:05.496 --> 22:07.121
I haven't been back
to the camp all night

22:07.165 --> 22:08.539
and I wasn't there
for breakfast.

22:08.583 --> 22:10.708
Which means.

22:10.752 --> 22:12.293
My men are looking for me.

22:14.506 --> 22:17.340
They have a standing order
to find my gin puckered asshole

22:17.384 --> 22:18.925
if I'm not back
by nine.

22:20.554 --> 22:24.014
So while you fellas
were playing poke the drunk,

22:24.058 --> 22:26.934
about a half a dozen or so
highly trained

22:26.977 --> 22:29.520
and very irritable
United States cavalry officers

22:29.564 --> 22:31.272
have been searching
for me.

22:31.315 --> 22:35.318
We are not far
and I do cut a wide trail.

22:35.361 --> 22:36.652
So...

22:36.696 --> 22:38.029
You're a liar.

22:38.073 --> 22:40.490
Sometimes.

22:40.534 --> 22:44.953
But right now I got supplies
and you got things to trade.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.371
What things?

22:46.415 --> 22:47.831
The boy.

22:51.086 --> 22:52.419
And that girl.

22:54.715 --> 22:57.258
U.S. Army
pays a handsome bounty

22:57.301 --> 22:59.385
for the return
of white captives.

22:59.429 --> 23:02.388
Army officers aren't allowed
to keep ransom for themselves.

23:02.432 --> 23:05.850
Well, you are a smart one,
ain't ya?

23:05.894 --> 23:07.811
Why don't you
leave the details to me?

23:11.525 --> 23:12.733
We have a trade?

23:16.530 --> 23:18.322
They're not for sale.

23:20.201 --> 23:21.534
Hyah!

23:21.577 --> 23:24.453
Toshaway.
They're coming.

23:25.915 --> 23:27.498
Now, why don't you
let me talk to my men

23:27.542 --> 23:28.916
before they see you here?

23:28.960 --> 23:31.419
I got tracks.
I think we found him.

23:32.714 --> 23:34.756
Nobody needs to die today.

23:39.054 --> 23:40.387
Hyah!

23:45.226 --> 23:48.020
Our orders are
to relocate you Comanches.

23:49.524 --> 23:52.275
Which is a shit job,
friends.

23:52.318 --> 23:55.445
You ever try
rounding up bands of natives

23:55.488 --> 23:58.406
and herding 'em
like cattle?

23:58.450 --> 24:00.909
Relocate us?
To where?

24:00.953 --> 24:02.619
Oklahoma Territory.

24:02.663 --> 24:05.330
You have
a patch of land.

24:05.374 --> 24:07.624
A place that is
reserved for you.

24:07.668 --> 24:10.336
We go
where we want.

24:10.379 --> 24:11.754
Sure you do,
my friend,

24:11.797 --> 24:13.547
but not for long.

24:15.301 --> 24:18.636
My job is to put you
behind a fence.

24:18.680 --> 24:23.641
But lucky for you,
I am terrible at my job.

24:23.685 --> 24:28.271
Now, you gimme the captives
and I'll forget we ever met.

24:28.315 --> 24:30.649
On top of that,
I'll throw in

24:30.693 --> 24:33.318
two crates
of tin beef,

24:33.362 --> 24:36.155
three horses

24:36.198 --> 24:37.781
and a rifle.

24:40.119 --> 24:42.078
That's a bad trade.

24:44.374 --> 24:47.083
I wouldn't say this in front of
your people out of due respect.

24:47.127 --> 24:52.881
But you need everything
that I have here and more.

24:55.344 --> 24:56.635
Toshaway.

25:10.235 --> 25:11.651
You can have the girl.

25:14.197 --> 25:15.572
I want them both.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.198
You can't have both.

25:17.242 --> 25:19.868
You can have the girl.
She's a captive.

25:19.912 --> 25:22.246
The other one
is a Comanche.

25:22.289 --> 25:25.165
Well, that's gonna cost you
two horses and a crate of beef.

25:25.209 --> 25:28.460
No, it's gonna cost me one horse
and a crate of beef.

25:29.797 --> 25:32.548
You're lucky you caught me
with my pants down.

25:32.592 --> 25:34.342
- Teddy!
- Sir.

25:34.385 --> 25:36.427
Bring the horses.
Yes, sir.

25:39.599 --> 25:41.766
Darling?

25:41.810 --> 25:43.143
You ready to go?

25:44.730 --> 25:46.355
Yes sir.

25:53.197 --> 25:54.738
- Ready, sir.
- Come on.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.098
It's a beautiful day.

26:59.476 --> 27:00.559
Yessir.

27:02.229 --> 27:04.104
Let's go out shootin'.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.275
Yessir.

27:14.868 --> 27:16.743
Good girl.

27:22.376 --> 27:26.962
You heard the story
of how I left the Comanches.

27:27.005 --> 27:29.172
Well, I know
that you had to leave

27:29.216 --> 27:30.507
so that
you could save them.

27:30.551 --> 27:32.217
Mm-hmm.

27:32.261 --> 27:34.887
Everyone was starvin'.

27:34.931 --> 27:38.140
Small pox, cholera,

27:38.184 --> 27:41.811
other diseases they'd never seen
and couldn't even name.

27:43.189 --> 27:46.441
There was no way
they were gonna make it.

27:46.485 --> 27:48.193
I traded myself
and Ingrid

27:48.236 --> 27:51.863
so the band could get
supplies and medicines.

27:51.907 --> 27:55.075
You were a hero.

27:55.119 --> 27:58.245
In the story, yeah.

27:58.289 --> 27:59.747
You're saying
it's not true?

27:59.790 --> 28:02.833
Oh, parts of it are,
parts of it are not.

28:04.295 --> 28:08.005
Survivors write the history
that suits them, Jeanne Anne.

28:08.049 --> 28:11.968
We fight hard
for that right.

28:12.012 --> 28:16.556
One day it will be you
who writes my story.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.266
What do you mean?

28:18.310 --> 28:20.519
This will all be yours.

28:20.563 --> 28:22.730
The ranch.
The oil business.

28:22.773 --> 28:25.107
All of it.

28:25.151 --> 28:30.154
After your father and your uncle
and I have passed,

28:30.198 --> 28:35.076
it will be you who build
on whatever we leave behind.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.077
Me?

28:36.121 --> 28:38.455
Yup.

28:38.498 --> 28:40.999
Not Charles.
Or Jonas.

28:41.043 --> 28:45.420
Oh, they'll own shares,

28:45.464 --> 28:47.631
but you'll be the one
who's in charge.

28:47.675 --> 28:49.008
But I'm a girl.

28:49.051 --> 28:51.343
I have noticed.

28:51.387 --> 28:52.762
Yes.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.434
Why are you
telling me this?

28:58.478 --> 28:59.686
Why now?

28:59.729 --> 29:01.980
It's time you understood
where you fit

29:02.023 --> 29:05.400
into the greater scheme
of things.

29:05.444 --> 29:08.195
Your place
in this family.

29:10.074 --> 29:11.074
Oh.

29:12.326 --> 29:14.660
Why do you seem scared?

29:21.002 --> 29:22.043
Granddaddy...

29:22.086 --> 29:23.169
Mm-hmm.

29:26.383 --> 29:28.842
I have something
to tell you.

29:32.305 --> 29:36.308
It is my honor to be here today,
to open this center

29:36.352 --> 29:41.897
for future generations of Texans
to understand our history.

29:41.941 --> 29:43.858
As my grandfather said,

29:43.901 --> 29:45.860
no matter what side you're on,

29:45.903 --> 29:48.196
there is one thing
that never changes:

29:48.239 --> 29:52.408
Everyone will lay it on the line
for the home they love.

29:52.452 --> 29:54.911
If...
If this motley world of man

29:54.955 --> 29:57.038
has one thing in common,
it's that.

29:58.584 --> 30:01.793
My grandfather was the sort of
man God doesn't make anymore.

30:04.131 --> 30:08.133
He was fearless, loyal,

30:08.177 --> 30:09.844
endlessly innovative.

30:09.887 --> 30:12.847
He could teach himself any skill

30:12.891 --> 30:14.932
and survive any hardship...

30:17.979 --> 30:20.563
...succeed at any endeavor.

30:20.607 --> 30:22.274
He was my hero.

30:24.403 --> 30:27.905
No story does him justice.

30:30.451 --> 30:35.913
In his later life, he learned
that he had lung cancer.

30:35.957 --> 30:40.293
It was not in his nature
to fade away,

30:40.336 --> 30:43.087
lying limp and frail
in a hospital bed.

30:43.131 --> 30:44.547
No.

30:44.591 --> 30:49.302
He put on his best boots
and a beaver felt hat.

30:49.346 --> 30:53.223
He pulled a Winchester 1886
from the gun closet

30:53.267 --> 30:55.559
and a couple hundred shells,

30:55.603 --> 30:58.145
and he drove to East Texas

30:58.189 --> 31:02.483
where the forests
are thick with game.

31:02.527 --> 31:07.572
My granddaddy was
the finest tracker.

31:07.616 --> 31:11.493
He cultivated the skill
his whole life.

31:11.536 --> 31:18.876
So he marched into
the thick, humid woods

31:18.919 --> 31:24.381
to track...
a grown... male... bear.

31:26.260 --> 31:28.219
The largest one he could find.

31:28.263 --> 31:31.472
And he could tell
from the tracks.

31:31.516 --> 31:34.767
He followed it for days,

31:34.811 --> 31:39.147
letting the bear
pick up the scent of him.

31:39.191 --> 31:44.736
You see, he wanted the bear to
know he was a formidable enemy.

31:44.780 --> 31:47.197
That they were matched.

32:07.554 --> 32:13.684
The most dangerous bear
is an injured bear.

32:21.778 --> 32:24.404
He chose to die...

32:25.615 --> 32:28.450
...in the Texas wilderness

32:28.493 --> 32:30.368
at the hands of the fiercest

32:30.412 --> 32:33.080
and most powerful animal
in our state.

32:34.583 --> 32:37.543
Because he wanted to die
with honor.

32:39.881 --> 32:44.425
And he chose to die that way
to inspire us to live...

32:52.686 --> 32:56.021
To live more boldly.

32:56.064 --> 33:01.819
So we carry his spirit into
the 21st century and beyond.

33:01.862 --> 33:03.070
Thank you.

33:05.741 --> 33:07.533
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, Ma'am?

33:07.577 --> 33:09.452
You see that Mexican?

33:09.495 --> 33:11.370
He doesn't belong here.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.042
Mexican kid with cropped hair
at the back by the columns.

33:16.086 --> 33:17.460
Shouldn't be here...

33:48.662 --> 33:50.412
I need to talk to you.

34:10.393 --> 34:13.103
No.
We're not doing that.

34:13.147 --> 34:15.306
Now you want to speak English
so they don't understand?

34:16.650 --> 34:17.940
I understand.

34:30.415 --> 34:33.081
I'm saving you
from shaming yourself.

34:33.126 --> 34:36.628
You said every warrior
has to do their part.

34:36.672 --> 34:38.964
This is how
I can do mine.

34:39.007 --> 34:41.300
What are you doing,
Tiehteti? Hmm?

34:42.887 --> 34:46.013
I pushed you too hard
to recover quickly.

34:46.056 --> 34:47.973
You can take more time.

34:48.016 --> 34:49.725
There'll never be enough.

34:51.312 --> 34:54.188
You're sad because of
your dead wife, so you leave?

34:54.232 --> 34:56.900
This talk
isn't like you.

34:56.943 --> 34:59.444
You think because
you brought me here,

34:59.488 --> 35:02.030
because you forced me
to live with you,

35:02.074 --> 35:03.824
you think you know me?

35:03.867 --> 35:04.908
Well, you don't!

35:04.952 --> 35:06.243
Be careful, Tiehteti.

35:06.287 --> 35:08.620
I did
everything you wanted.

35:08.664 --> 35:10.289
And it didn't matter.

35:12.084 --> 35:14.126
I feel like...

35:14.170 --> 35:15.378
What?

35:15.421 --> 35:17.296
Say it.

35:17.340 --> 35:20.049
I feel like I lost my family
all over again.

35:22.304 --> 35:24.804
We are your family.

35:24.848 --> 35:27.724
You're my son.

35:27.768 --> 35:30.852
And you're wrong,
Tiehteti.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.312
I do know you.

35:32.356 --> 35:34.189
You want to leave
because everywhere you look,

35:34.233 --> 35:37.192
you see reminders
of what you lost.

35:37.236 --> 35:40.362
But you can't run from that.

35:40.406 --> 35:42.657
All the shadows
that we don't want to see

35:42.700 --> 35:45.201
are scattered
across this whole world.

35:49.624 --> 35:54.085
If you go,
you're no longer a warrior.

35:55.172 --> 35:58.465
If you go, you lose honor.

36:49.271 --> 36:50.729
Hey!

36:50.773 --> 36:52.356
Come here a minute.

37:04.871 --> 37:06.830
You got anything
you want to tell us?

37:06.873 --> 37:09.749
Such as?

37:09.793 --> 37:10.750
Where you're hiding
not. Maria García.

37:10.794 --> 37:12.961
Stop for a second

37:13.005 --> 37:15.047
and think
about your answer again.

37:18.010 --> 37:19.218
What's going on here?

37:23.182 --> 37:25.766
You tried to take
my granddaughter away.

37:28.480 --> 37:32.482
I was trying
to save my daughter from you.

37:34.194 --> 37:36.153
You killed
Maria's whole family.

37:36.196 --> 37:37.821
No, you did.

37:37.865 --> 37:40.324
You banged on that family's door
in the middle of the night

37:40.367 --> 37:42.826
and stirred up
a good ol' panic.

37:42.870 --> 37:44.870
You got Pedro García
itching for a fight

37:44.914 --> 37:46.664
like a back alley
game cock.

37:46.707 --> 37:49.792
You are one crazy old man.
You gave them false hope.

37:49.836 --> 37:52.170
You gave them time
to prepare forces

37:52.213 --> 37:55.507
and marshal for a siege
that was never meant to happen.

37:55.550 --> 37:57.342
If you hadn't gone there,

37:57.386 --> 37:59.052
they would've
surrendered quietly

37:59.096 --> 38:00.846
and still be alive today.

38:00.889 --> 38:03.849
Their blood is on your hands
as much as it is on mine.

38:03.892 --> 38:05.183
No. No!

38:09.398 --> 38:10.898
Enough!

38:10.942 --> 38:13.025
Enough!

38:13.069 --> 38:15.361
Enough. Enough.

38:20.577 --> 38:22.285
I'm gonna be a witness
in her case.

38:24.206 --> 38:27.499
Tell them
everything you did.

38:27.543 --> 38:33.338
And take away
your children's birthright?

38:33.382 --> 38:34.798
Their home?
Their land?

38:36.761 --> 38:38.678
I'm... I'm done, Daddy.

38:38.721 --> 38:40.596
Do your worst.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.889
It doesn't hurt me
anymore.

38:41.933 --> 38:43.891
Go on, son.

38:43.935 --> 38:47.520
You take whatever horse you like
from the barn and run.

38:49.566 --> 38:51.858
I will find you
wherever you go.

39:26.981 --> 39:28.564
Eli!

39:30.777 --> 39:31.901
You came.

39:34.823 --> 39:37.448
I thought you'd stay
with them forever.

39:37.492 --> 39:40.118
Well, lookie here.

39:40.162 --> 39:41.661
I guess
Ol' Chief Toshaway

39:41.705 --> 39:43.955
really wanted
that crate of beef, huh?

39:43.999 --> 39:45.749
You can
collect the reward for me

39:45.793 --> 39:47.626
in exchange
for two horses,

39:47.670 --> 39:49.837
the rest of the blankets
you have to trade,

39:49.880 --> 39:51.672
one rifle, and a colt.

39:51.716 --> 39:55.301
A princely sum, that.

39:55.345 --> 39:56.761
You worth it?

40:01.518 --> 40:04.686
I've been living with the
Comanches for almost four years.

40:04.730 --> 40:08.148
I learned their way.
I learned their language.

40:08.192 --> 40:11.026
I know all their trails,
all their campsites.

40:11.070 --> 40:12.945
I'm worth more
than what I'm asking.

40:12.988 --> 40:14.822
Where you from, son?

40:14.865 --> 40:16.198
Near the Pedernales.

40:16.242 --> 40:18.826
Right across
the settlement line.

40:18.870 --> 40:21.621
House burned down now.

40:21.664 --> 40:28.253
What's your Christian name?

40:29.714 --> 40:31.172
Do you even remember it.

40:45.398 --> 40:47.940
Why did you lie
about your name?

40:50.236 --> 40:53.404
It's a fresh start
for both of us.

40:53.448 --> 40:55.198
Eli.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.912
My real father's
still out there.

41:00.956 --> 41:03.665
I don't want them
taking me back to him.

41:19.601 --> 41:21.059
What happened?

41:21.103 --> 41:22.394
They know everything.

41:23.438 --> 41:24.729
I'm fine.

41:25.941 --> 41:27.065
Is that your father?

41:29.111 --> 41:31.403
I don't know.
Get inside.

41:33.074 --> 41:36.200
Why don't you let me
do the talkin', Pete?

41:48.465 --> 41:52.926
I'm Niles Gilbert
and you are on my land.

41:52.970 --> 41:57.097
State your name and business
or I will exercise my rights.

41:57.141 --> 41:59.767
Mr. Gilbert, my name
is Joseph Dickerson

41:59.810 --> 42:02.436
and I'm an employee of
Standard Oil of Pennsylvania.

42:02.480 --> 42:05.481
We're here to offer
protection services

42:05.525 --> 42:07.942
for yourself
and Miss García.

42:07.986 --> 42:08.986
Is she present?
