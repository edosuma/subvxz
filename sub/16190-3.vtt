00:42.802 --> 00:44.002
Huh?

00:44.037 --> 00:45.737
Just, it's on him now,

00:45.772 --> 00:47.204
so I need you to surprise him

00:47.240 --> 00:49.541
because he's, he's too controlled now.

00:49.576 --> 00:51.108
- Okay.
- Do you mind?

00:51.144 --> 00:53.444
No. Totally, I, I think I got it.

00:53.479 --> 00:54.678

This is on you, this is real close.

01:03.022 --> 01:04.622
We want to see this
thing hit you, right?

01:04.657 --> 01:05.756
Yeah, I got it.

01:05.791 --> 01:08.059
And, and... the feeling.

01:08.094 --> 01:09.126
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09.162 --> 01:11.995
- Hey, uh...
- Thanks, Kunta.

01:12.031 --> 01:15.231
Are you, uh, above
this? Because I want to...

01:15.267 --> 01:16.733
You're tight. You're tight.

01:16.769 --> 01:17.737
All right, all right.

01:17.846 --> 01:20.256
- WOMAN: All right, finishing up.
- Here we go.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.207
WOMAN 2: All right, and
let's roll sound, please.

01:24.242 --> 01:25.442
WOMAN 3: Rolling, rolling.

01:25.477 --> 01:26.709
MAN: Quiet, please.

01:26.744 --> 01:28.578
WOMAN 2: Sound speed. Marker.

01:28.613 --> 01:30.346
Uh... Cameras are set.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.914
Action.

01:33.017 --> 01:34.717
So I'm really sorry.

01:34.752 --> 01:36.119
There's nothing I can do.

01:36.154 --> 01:38.654
You lost custody of Maggie.

01:38.690 --> 01:40.190
Oh, my God, Maggie.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.258
Yeah.

01:42.294 --> 01:43.759
You're never gonna see her again,

01:43.795 --> 01:45.360
and it's all your fault.

01:49.366 --> 01:50.332
What?

01:50.367 --> 01:51.601
Cut!

01:51.636 --> 01:53.168
Why did you say that? That's...

01:53.204 --> 01:54.648
- Sorry.
- That's, that's not in the script.

01:54.672 --> 01:56.016
- Sorry.
- That's not in the script.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.272
That felt... That felt weird.

01:57.308 --> 01:58.908
Big man, that was... That was amazing.

01:58.943 --> 02:00.709
- Yeah?
- It's a great, great day.

02:00.744 --> 02:01.776
(chuckles)

02:01.812 --> 02:02.911
It's a great, great day.

02:02.946 --> 02:04.679
You're doing... Yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:04.715 --> 02:06.681
- Oh, okay.
- Right.

02:07.985 --> 02:09.618
Thank you.

02:12.823 --> 02:13.888
Hey.

02:13.924 --> 02:15.056
Hey.

02:15.092 --> 02:16.290
How are you holding up?

02:16.326 --> 02:19.227
I'm all right. You know, it's, uh,

02:19.262 --> 02:21.496
- this is work, but, uh,
- Yeah.

02:21.531 --> 02:23.464
I'm blessed to be working.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.666
That is right.

02:24.701 --> 02:26.134
I just want to say

02:26.653 --> 02:27.885
I'm a fan from way back.

02:27.921 --> 02:30.155
- I mean, you are great.
- Oh, no, no.

02:30.190 --> 02:31.323
You are so...

02:31.358 --> 02:33.290
You don't have to say
that, Mel, but I do.

02:33.326 --> 02:34.826
I love your movies.

02:34.861 --> 02:38.329
Well, I used to, too, when
they were my movies.

02:38.364 --> 02:39.831
I know, but you're great,

02:39.866 --> 02:42.399
and it's an honor to be
working with you, really.

02:42.435 --> 02:43.935
Oh, thanks, Sammy.

02:43.970 --> 02:46.270
Well, then it's only fair to tell you

02:46.305 --> 02:49.306
that my brother and I used to say

02:49.342 --> 02:52.184
"Oh, stop it" all the time.

02:52.296 --> 02:53.688
Oh, my God, that's a nightmare.

02:53.712 --> 02:54.945
No, no. Seriously,

02:54.980 --> 02:55.780
that show killed us.

02:55.814 --> 02:57.348
And when you did the sad episodes,

02:57.383 --> 02:59.150
we'd both pretend not to be crying.

02:59.185 --> 03:00.384
Aw.

03:00.419 --> 03:01.985
Yeah, the sad shows were the best.

03:02.021 --> 03:04.555
I don't need you. I don't need anybody.

03:04.590 --> 03:05.956
(chuckles)

03:05.991 --> 03:07.824
Well,

03:07.860 --> 03:09.926
not to jerk each other off too much,

03:09.962 --> 03:13.630
but Move Down is my Bible.

03:13.666 --> 03:16.700
And it formed me.

03:16.735 --> 03:19.002
- Really?
- Yeah. It did.

03:19.038 --> 03:20.937
A little bit. It did a little bit.

03:20.973 --> 03:23.306
Well, that's... That's all right.

03:23.341 --> 03:24.641
DAVID: Melly Mel!

03:24.676 --> 03:27.009
Mel, I found these,
uh, Tibetan prayer beads

03:27.045 --> 03:29.078
over at, uh, props, and
I-I want to wear them.

03:29.113 --> 03:30.558
Teak's, uh, Teak's going to wear these.

03:30.582 --> 03:31.981
I know it doesn't match,

03:32.016 --> 03:33.727
- but continuity's for pussies, right?
- Uh...

03:33.751 --> 03:35.818
So Teak's a Buddhist
now. Right? It's cool.

03:35.853 --> 03:37.720
- Or Hindu.
- Prayer-prayer beads?

03:37.755 --> 03:39.188
Yeah.

03:39.223 --> 03:41.023
He's...

03:43.627 --> 03:45.761
(laughing)

03:45.797 --> 03:49.464
Well... we used to
both do our own thing,

03:49.500 --> 03:51.901
and, uh, now we're doing his thing.

03:51.936 --> 03:55.171
Yeah, but it's good to
work with good people, though,

03:55.206 --> 03:56.538
along the way.

03:56.574 --> 03:59.575
Well, that's what keeps me going.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.176
You doing okay?

04:01.212 --> 04:02.844
Yeah. I mean,

04:02.879 --> 04:04.646
it's hard for me being out here.

04:04.682 --> 04:07.949
I mean, I-I need my-my
home comforts

04:07.984 --> 04:09.818
and, uh...

04:09.853 --> 04:11.687
living in a hotel for a month,

04:11.722 --> 04:13.221
you know, gets old, but, uh,

04:13.256 --> 04:15.289
Yeah, of course it does.

04:15.325 --> 04:16.690
I'm whining.

04:16.726 --> 04:19.793
No, no. Everybody needs to be home.

04:19.829 --> 04:21.750
You should come to my house for dinner.

04:21.868 --> 04:23.776
Come have dinner with me and my girls.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.600
And my mom. Just be

04:25.635 --> 04:27.180
with a family for a
night. You could have

04:27.204 --> 04:30.238
some home-cooked food or
some home-ordered takeout.

04:30.273 --> 04:31.872
Come on, Mel, we're bros.

04:31.907 --> 04:33.006
Seriously?

04:33.042 --> 04:35.443
Because, I mean, I
mean, I'm-I'm tempted.

04:35.478 --> 04:36.910
Yeah, you want to come tomorrow?

04:36.946 --> 04:38.812
Um, I could swing tomorrow.

04:38.848 --> 04:40.314
Good. You're coming.

04:42.017 --> 04:43.284
Tomorrow.

04:43.319 --> 04:44.918
You bet.

04:44.954 --> 04:47.554
Wait. I'm sorry. Was that Mel Trueblood?

04:47.589 --> 04:49.556
Yeah.

04:49.591 --> 04:51.424
Are you having dirty with Mel Trueblood?

04:51.460 --> 04:53.093
Oh, my God, I love your life.

04:53.129 --> 04:55.796
You love what you pretend my life is.

04:55.831 --> 04:57.765
And no, we're not
doing any dirty things.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.366
You are. You totally are.

04:59.401 --> 05:00.834
How would I not tell you?

05:00.870 --> 05:02.636
On what planet am I not telling you?

05:02.671 --> 05:04.537
Okay, so you're hoping.

05:04.573 --> 05:05.772
No.

05:05.807 --> 05:07.907
No, he's a nice guy.

05:07.942 --> 05:11.244
And, uh, he's also a genius.

05:11.280 --> 05:13.880
(deep gasping)

05:13.915 --> 05:16.516
Sunny, stop. That's gross.

05:16.551 --> 05:19.152
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for being gross.

05:20.288 --> 05:21.520
Yeah. I mean,

05:21.555 --> 05:24.290
he's cute, he's sexy.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.659
And I'm pretty sure he's married.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.928
Let's find out.

05:28.963 --> 05:30.797
What are you doing? Don't.

05:30.832 --> 05:32.832
I'm googling your genius new boyfriend.

05:32.867 --> 05:34.733
No, no. Not while you're driving.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.302
We're gonna get into an accident.

05:36.337 --> 05:37.803
- I hate this!
- Dummy...

05:37.838 --> 05:40.105
- This is nervous...
- A Tesla.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.139
It drives itself.

05:41.175 --> 05:44.677
Can you please put your
hands on the wheel?

05:44.712 --> 05:46.945
This gives me a
terrible feeling in my stomach.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.011
I hate it.

05:48.131 --> 05:49.493
Aw, man, he's wicked married.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.783
Okay, good.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.750
Now you driving and
not the robot doing it.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.252
- Thank you.
- Okay.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.722
Do you have to go right home?

05:57.757 --> 05:59.457
Yeah, honey. I don't want to go out.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.993
No, just come over for a little bit.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.728
Fine.

06:07.483 --> 06:09.392
You know, you still
could sleep with him.

06:09.393 --> 06:10.506
Who?

06:10.541 --> 06:12.841
Mr. Mo' Money Farouk back there.

06:12.877 --> 06:13.975
(groans)

06:14.011 --> 06:15.076
(quietly): No.

06:15.112 --> 06:17.578
You just have to
promise to tell me if you do.

06:18.615 --> 06:20.248
You promise to tell me if you do.

06:20.283 --> 06:22.450
Pinky swear right now before
we go into the house.

06:22.486 --> 06:24.052
I'm not gonna do it. He's married.

06:24.087 --> 06:26.154
- Uh-huh.
- Will you make me a lemon drop?

06:26.189 --> 06:27.588
Totally.

06:27.624 --> 06:30.024
MAN: Hey, Sammy.

06:30.059 --> 06:32.292
Hi, Jeff.

06:33.029 --> 06:34.161
SUNNY: Hey, hon.

06:34.196 --> 06:37.965
Hey, baby. Your I, uh,
deal keeps making noise.

06:38.001 --> 06:39.667
Yeah, I know.

06:39.702 --> 06:42.102
Can you look at it like I asked you?

06:42.138 --> 06:43.804
All my stuff is broken.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.906
Oh, Jesus, I'm so tired.

06:44.941 --> 06:46.407
You know what, though? Later, maybe.

06:46.442 --> 06:51.311
So are you wasted right now?

06:51.347 --> 06:52.913
JEFF: Okay, eat shit.

06:52.948 --> 06:53.947
Kidding.

06:53.982 --> 06:56.517
You know, but eat you some shit, though.

06:56.552 --> 06:58.152
Right? (laughing)

07:00.256 --> 07:02.056
(laughing): What?

07:02.091 --> 07:04.257
Baby!

07:04.292 --> 07:06.492
(sighs)

07:06.528 --> 07:08.962
Eh, women, huh?

07:08.997 --> 07:11.330
SAM: Yeah.

07:11.366 --> 07:12.532
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

07:12.568 --> 07:14.367
Seriously, though,

07:14.402 --> 07:16.169
she's often a psycho.

07:16.204 --> 07:17.303
Right, Sam?

07:17.338 --> 07:19.105
Yeah.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.107
I mean... (chuckles)

07:21.142 --> 07:22.486
I don't want to preach to the choir.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.277
No, totally. I get it.

07:24.312 --> 07:25.545
You're awesome, Sammy.

07:25.580 --> 07:27.080
Yeah.

07:27.115 --> 07:28.714
Hey, seriously, for a second, though,

07:28.749 --> 07:30.950
like, what would she do without me?

07:30.985 --> 07:31.817
You know?

07:31.852 --> 07:33.786
Or you, for that matter.

07:33.821 --> 07:36.722
I mean, I know I don't have to tell you.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.591
It's like you know...
You know her forever.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.459
You guys go, like, way back.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.261
Yeah. We go way, way back.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.731
You know this.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.634
My dad and I got in a fight, and, uh,

07:48.669 --> 07:49.780
he kicked me out of the house,

07:49.804 --> 07:51.770
and I was so scared,

07:51.806 --> 07:54.973
and she took me in,
and she got me a job.

07:55.008 --> 07:55.974
Whoa.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.576
Yeah, she was

07:57.611 --> 08:00.612
19, she was already taking
care of people.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.481
She was amazing.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.648
She was full of confidence.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.750
She was so beautiful.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.988
I mean, I never knew
anybody who had so much potential.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.625
And then she met you, Jeff.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.292
Jesus, did she love you.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.527
Yeah.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.429
And here's Sunny...

08:18.464 --> 08:20.564
All right, this woman who

08:20.600 --> 08:22.500
loves so hard and she tries so hard,

08:22.535 --> 08:25.036
and she just ends up

08:25.071 --> 08:28.071
pouring all of that
love into you for years.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.941
Jeff, do you know what that's like

08:30.976 --> 08:33.644
to watch your friend, someone you love,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.779
someone who is like a goddess

08:35.813 --> 08:38.448
with the power to fly to the moon

08:38.484 --> 08:40.851
and shine a light on the world,

08:40.885 --> 08:43.820
and she ends up using all of that power

08:43.856 --> 08:46.690
just to keep her fat, shit,

08:46.725 --> 08:48.925
useless, boring

08:48.961 --> 08:51.662
stoner husband barely afloat?

08:51.697 --> 08:53.997
It's just a shame, Jeff.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.032
(scoffs)

08:55.067 --> 08:57.567
Well, here's the thing.

08:57.602 --> 09:00.903
I know that you have...

09:00.938 --> 09:04.374
sucked your share of dicks, huh?

09:04.409 --> 09:06.876
I've heard about you.

09:06.911 --> 09:08.611
That's okay, buddy. Don't bother.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.180
I don't care what you know.

09:10.215 --> 09:12.848
Okay, well, here's the thing.

09:12.884 --> 09:14.850
I'm gonna have to
say that I cannot believe

09:14.886 --> 09:18.453
that you just said all of that to me.

09:18.489 --> 09:20.990
Jesus, I'm offended.

09:21.025 --> 09:22.858
Serious.

09:22.894 --> 09:24.160
Don't worry about it.

09:24.195 --> 09:25.394
You won't remember.

09:25.429 --> 09:26.729
You know why I know that?

09:26.764 --> 09:28.798
Because I said all of this to you

09:28.833 --> 09:31.667
five years ago, and you don't remember

09:31.702 --> 09:34.503
because you've smoked 10,000
joints since then,

09:34.538 --> 09:37.872
so... good night, Jeff.

09:37.908 --> 09:40.309
See you at the next thing.

09:43.714 --> 09:45.914
All right, good night, Sammy.

09:49.116 --> 09:51.423
Hello. I'm home.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.349
Mama, you're home. I missed you.

09:54.385 --> 09:55.384
Hi.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.386
- Oh!
- Where were you?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.021
Mommy had to work today, remember?

09:59.056 --> 10:00.456
- FRANKIE: Hi, Mom.
- I told you.

10:00.491 --> 10:02.757
Hey, come meet our guest!

10:02.793 --> 10:04.726
Mel, this is Max,

10:04.761 --> 10:07.195
and this little one I'm holding is Duke.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.297
She's very small.

10:08.332 --> 10:10.198
- Hiya, Duke.
- Hi.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.066
Sam?

10:11.101 --> 10:13.568
Oh, this is my sitter Lauren.

10:13.603 --> 10:14.702
It's Mel.

10:14.738 --> 10:16.571
Can I talk to you?

10:16.606 --> 10:18.740
Yeah. What's up?

10:18.775 --> 10:20.219
It's just getting really
difficult the way

10:20.243 --> 10:21.976
your girls talk to
me when you're not here,

10:22.011 --> 10:24.256
- and I just think that they should
learn some respect, - Oh, okay.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.091
- And I don't know anything about...
- Okay, I have

10:26.115 --> 10:28.182
to cook good dinner, and
so thanks for coming.

10:28.217 --> 10:30.151
I love you. Bye.

10:30.186 --> 10:31.218
Frankie, come here.

10:31.254 --> 10:33.988
Mel, this is Frankie.

10:34.023 --> 10:35.589
Hi.

10:35.624 --> 10:37.291
Hi.

10:37.327 --> 10:38.926
Hi.

10:38.962 --> 10:40.094
Hi.

10:40.129 --> 10:41.195
Oh.

10:41.230 --> 10:42.496
Hi.

10:42.531 --> 10:43.564
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.066
Hi.

10:45.101 --> 10:46.200
Hi.

10:46.235 --> 10:47.501
Wait, one more hi.

10:47.536 --> 10:48.569
Hi.

10:48.604 --> 10:49.681
Oh, then I got to do this again

10:49.705 --> 10:51.772
to make it even. Hi.

10:54.810 --> 10:59.012
Put on pants.

11:00.983 --> 11:01.882
What?

11:01.917 --> 11:04.184
Are you gonna marry him?

11:04.219 --> 11:05.285
Hey, Duke?

11:05.320 --> 11:07.488
(whispers): You need
to learn how to whisper.

11:07.523 --> 11:10.690
Wait, so you're, like, an actor
in the movie Mom's in?

11:10.725 --> 11:11.958
No, I'm the director.

11:11.994 --> 11:13.360
- PHYLLIS: Hello!
- Oh.

11:13.395 --> 11:14.127
There's my mom.

11:14.162 --> 11:15.561
You're about to meet my mother.

11:15.597 --> 11:17.330
Hi, Mom.

11:17.366 --> 11:19.232
Hello, sweetheart.

11:19.267 --> 11:20.433
Mom, this is Mel.

11:20.469 --> 11:22.602
Mel, this is my mother Phyllis.

11:22.637 --> 11:25.337
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Fox.

11:25.373 --> 11:26.739
It's very nice to meet you.

11:26.774 --> 11:27.940
Yes, well.

11:28.429 --> 11:30.195
Mom, did you take our phone book?

11:30.230 --> 11:31.574
Because I noticed all the neighbors

11:31.598 --> 11:32.842
- have their phone books.
- No, no.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.010
Why would I take your phone book?

11:34.034 --> 11:35.100
I took my phone book,

11:35.135 --> 11:36.212
which was left at your step.

11:36.236 --> 11:37.744
No, that's mine.

11:37.918 --> 11:39.515
I always ask for two phone books,

11:39.539 --> 11:40.605
and they only brought one,

11:40.640 --> 11:42.474
so the one at your step must be mine.

11:42.509 --> 11:43.541
Mom!

11:43.577 --> 11:45.610
I learned a piano song, come listen.

11:48.014 --> 11:50.147
Come with me to the kitchen.

11:50.183 --> 11:52.951
Okay, off you go.

11:54.153 --> 11:56.554
♪ ♪

11:56.590 --> 11:59.857
(humming "Sleeping Beauty Waltz")

11:59.892 --> 12:02.293
I know this one.

12:02.328 --> 12:05.062
Um, did you not tell your mother

12:05.098 --> 12:06.541
that you were bringing home a black man?

12:06.565 --> 12:09.333
What? Oh, no. Of course not.

12:09.369 --> 12:10.468
That's not... No.

12:10.503 --> 12:11.969
- I mean...
- What? No!

12:12.005 --> 12:13.337
You should've told her.

12:13.373 --> 12:14.405
No, no, no, no, no.

12:14.440 --> 12:15.817
I'm telling you, that's not a thing.

12:15.841 --> 12:18.809
My mother is just insane. She
makes people feel weird.

12:18.844 --> 12:19.877
It's like her hobby.

12:19.912 --> 12:20.978
No, Sam.

12:21.013 --> 12:22.846
She's over 70, okay?

12:22.882 --> 12:25.749
You warn her that a
black man's coming over,

12:25.784 --> 12:27.618
even if it's to fix the cable box.

12:27.653 --> 12:29.887
Oh, my God. I'm telling you,

12:29.922 --> 12:31.154
My mother is not like that.

12:31.189 --> 12:32.989
She marched for integration.

12:33.025 --> 12:34.190
It doesn't matter, okay?

12:34.226 --> 12:35.892
I'm not calling your mother racist.

12:35.927 --> 12:37.660
I'm calling her over 70.

12:37.695 --> 12:41.331
You tell an old white
lady ahead of time, okay?

12:41.366 --> 12:43.566
You warn her. It's the right thing to do

12:43.601 --> 12:46.336
for the old lady and the
black guy coming over.

12:46.371 --> 12:49.438
Okay. No. I think you're wrong.

12:49.473 --> 12:51.206
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm hearing you,

12:51.242 --> 12:53.676
and I know you feel certain of this,

12:53.711 --> 12:57.146
but I think that this is your thing.

12:57.181 --> 13:00.750
That's not real. It's not.

13:00.785 --> 13:02.317
Oh, yeah, we don't have a mezuzah.

13:02.353 --> 13:03.597
- What's up with that?
- We're not that.

13:03.621 --> 13:05.387
- Yeah.
- FRANKIE: Mm-mm! One time,

13:05.423 --> 13:07.056
Max was going to dance class,

13:07.091 --> 13:09.224
and she had this awful stomach virus.

13:09.260 --> 13:11.771
- Frankie, don't tell that story.
- It was like a dress rehearsal

13:11.795 --> 13:13.628
- for a dance concert.
- MEL: Right.

13:13.664 --> 13:15.264
And she was wearing this white leotard.

13:15.299 --> 13:17.399
- Okay, stop it.
- SAM: Frankie?

13:17.435 --> 13:18.412
- MAX: Stop.
- DUKE: No, let her tell it.

13:18.436 --> 13:19.535
- Come on. What?!
- Mm-mm.

13:19.570 --> 13:22.270
So she misses the, the dress rehearsal.

13:22.305 --> 13:24.839
She's gonna be
dropped out of the concert.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.274
- MEL: Mm-hmm.
- MAX: Mom!

13:26.309 --> 13:27.520
But she has this stomach virus...

13:27.544 --> 13:28.788
Frankie, you can't tell this story

13:28.812 --> 13:30.979
- 'cause we're eating.
- Oh, come on. Mom...

13:31.014 --> 13:32.547
MAX: No! Shut up!

13:32.583 --> 13:33.815
Frankie, you're stopping.

13:33.850 --> 13:35.283
Fine. Fine. Fine.

13:35.318 --> 13:36.429
- Thank you.
- Okay, I'm done.

13:36.453 --> 13:37.985
- You're welcome.
- I'm done.

13:40.623 --> 13:42.468
And then, right in the
middle of doing a big split,

13:42.492 --> 13:43.702
brown poop squirted out of her butt

13:43.726 --> 13:45.259
all over the perfect white leotard!

13:45.295 --> 13:46.660
(laughter)

13:46.696 --> 13:47.895
Mom!

13:47.930 --> 13:50.864
(laughter continues)

13:50.900 --> 13:52.533
SAM: Sorry, Mel.

13:52.569 --> 13:55.302
We like that kind of humor at dinner.

13:55.337 --> 13:57.137
Oh, no, no, no. It's-it's fine.

13:57.172 --> 13:58.338
(quietly) What are you doing?

13:58.373 --> 14:00.140
MEL: Are you, uh, still studying dance?

14:00.175 --> 14:01.541
MAX: I do this thing.

14:01.577 --> 14:02.710
It's-it's a modern class.

14:02.745 --> 14:04.778
It's based on this
thing called Alvin Ailey.

14:04.814 --> 14:05.646
I don't know if...

14:05.681 --> 14:07.948
Sure, I-I-I studied there, actually.

14:07.984 --> 14:09.382
You did?

14:09.418 --> 14:11.351
Yeah, in New York when
I was in high school.

14:11.386 --> 14:13.653
That's great that you're doing that.

14:13.688 --> 14:15.388
Even if you don't dance, which,

14:15.424 --> 14:17.290
you know, I gave it up when I was 19,

14:17.326 --> 14:19.092
but you'll never regret it.

14:19.128 --> 14:20.860
I mean, it's still a part of me.

14:20.895 --> 14:22.295
Yeah?

14:22.331 --> 14:23.997
Thanks.

14:24.032 --> 14:25.520
No, you're lucky,

14:25.522 --> 14:27.712
because when I was your age
and I was aching to be an artist,

14:27.736 --> 14:30.136
I had to explain that to my parents.

14:30.171 --> 14:32.005
My father was a janitor.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.273
My mom's still a nurse.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.709
But they didn't know from art.

14:36.745 --> 14:40.079
You're lucky because your
mother is an artist.

14:40.115 --> 14:41.881
Well, she's not, like, an artist.

14:41.916 --> 14:45.451
Yes, she is. She's, like, an artist.

14:45.486 --> 14:47.386
Well, thank you, Mel.

14:47.421 --> 14:49.288
That's very nice of you, Mel.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.823
The last time I was in London,

14:51.859 --> 14:55.161
I went to Harrods to
buy pantyhose, and so,

14:55.196 --> 14:58.464
I go to the lingerie department,

14:58.499 --> 15:00.732
and Harrods had their
own brand of pantyhose,

15:00.768 --> 15:02.901
and they're the only ones I wear,

15:02.936 --> 15:05.137
and you can only buy
them at that counter.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.972
And their hose has three colors,

15:07.741 --> 15:10.642
Nude, White, and Nigger Brown.

15:10.678 --> 15:13.111
That was the name of the color.

15:13.147 --> 15:15.080
And that's the color I always buy.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.781
So I go to the counter,

15:16.816 --> 15:18.916
and the young woman
who was working there

15:18.951 --> 15:20.518
happened to be black.

15:20.554 --> 15:23.588
And I said to her, "I
would like medium-size hose."

15:23.623 --> 15:25.790
And she says, "What color, please?"

15:25.825 --> 15:28.059
and so I said, "Nigger Brown."

15:28.094 --> 15:29.994
And she was shocked.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.197
I said it just like that.
I could see she was upset.

15:33.232 --> 15:35.299
I said to her, "I did you the honor

15:35.334 --> 15:36.801
"of not noticing your color.

15:36.836 --> 15:40.171
Would you do me the honor
of getting my item for me?"

15:40.206 --> 15:41.371
So she went and got them,

15:41.407 --> 15:44.374
and after that, I paid for the hose.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.043
Just so you know.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.746
Oh, I need to use the loo.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:03.667 --> 16:05.518
You know, you're are really nice fimily.

16:05.519 --> 16:07.457
Thank you. They love you,

16:07.547 --> 16:09.780
and I am sorry about my mom.

16:09.816 --> 16:11.456
No, no, no. Don't be
sorry about your mom.

16:11.484 --> 16:12.883
Never be sorry about your mom.

16:12.919 --> 16:16.721
No, Mel. I'm very
sorry about my shitty mother.

16:16.756 --> 16:19.156
Okay, well, I don't know her.

16:19.192 --> 16:21.592
No, you don't.

16:22.829 --> 16:24.929
Um...

16:24.964 --> 16:26.030
Yeah.

16:26.065 --> 16:27.664
I...

16:29.301 --> 16:30.667
You know, I have a friend

16:30.703 --> 16:35.239
who is very invested in
wanting us to have sex.

16:35.274 --> 16:36.707
Really?

16:36.742 --> 16:39.743
She needs us to do it. It's pretty bad.

16:40.946 --> 16:42.145
Well...

16:44.082 --> 16:46.583
But I'm not about to get
into a thing with a married guy.

16:46.619 --> 16:49.686
That's just not, that's not me.

16:52.257 --> 16:55.792
Well, I mean, I'm going through
a divorce right now,

16:55.827 --> 16:58.061
and I've been going through a divorce,

16:58.096 --> 17:00.797
and we've been separated for months.

17:02.267 --> 17:04.367
But I, uh, you know,

17:04.402 --> 17:05.969
am going back to New York tomorrow.

17:06.003 --> 17:07.237
Yeah.

17:07.271 --> 17:09.739
And as much as my brother

17:09.773 --> 17:12.540
would want me to throw
down with Sammy Fox, I mean...

17:12.577 --> 17:15.411
- Hey.
- Hey. You know.

17:15.445 --> 17:18.079
I don't know. I mean...

17:18.115 --> 17:20.249
I mean, I like you.

17:21.486 --> 17:23.952
But I don't want to hook up with you.

17:23.988 --> 17:27.321
I mean, actually, I really like you.

17:27.357 --> 17:29.324
Yeah, me, too.

17:29.359 --> 17:30.893
I mean, there's...

17:30.928 --> 17:31.994
No. Yeah.

17:32.029 --> 17:34.596
...a feeling there. Uh, it's...
