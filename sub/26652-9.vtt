Legends Of Tomorrow...

00:03.560 --> 00:04.560
<i>Hello, John.</i>

00:04.640 --> 00:07.997
You opened a door, love. And Mallus
wasn't the only thing that got out.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.355
Now, there's magic.

00:09.440 --> 00:12.592
The damage that these supernatural
fugitives can cause is unfathomable.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.876
- How much money do you need?
- $4.2 billion a year.

00:14.960 --> 00:15.960
Done.

00:16.040 --> 00:17.376
<i>I'm gonna green light
additional funding</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:19.756
<i>to fast track the completion
of your containment facility.</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:21.877
Hi. I'm your magical caretaker.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.400
Your creature handler, she's great.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.999
- Mona.
- Konane.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.355
<i>Did someone hurt you?</i>

00:26.440 --> 00:28.318
<i>These creatures are controllable.</i>

00:28.440 --> 00:30.432
Project Hades is go.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.637
Stop! Where are you taking him?

00:41.040 --> 00:42.080
Oh, thank God you're back.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.390
What is going on?

00:43.680 --> 00:45.512
Long story. Lots of twists and turns.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.910
- Some dramatic irony.
- Cliff notes, Gary.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.832
- The Kaupe is out.
- Director Sharpe.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.992
Gary, take him down to lockup.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.590
Aw!

00:54.680 --> 00:56.319
What an adorable little puppet.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.196
Eat my fuzzy dung, you dick!

01:00.160 --> 01:01.719
Well, well, well.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.720
Look who finally decided
to show up for work.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.918
Nice of you to grace us
with your presence, Director Sharpe.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.595
One of your employees
let a creature loose,

01:10.680 --> 01:13.400
and then not surprisingly
got attacked by it.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.069
Wait. Mona let him out?
Why would she...

01:20.160 --> 01:23.790
I want that wolfman back in his cell,
or you're done.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.234
And fire that girl.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.279
Of all the days this could happen.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.696
All right, everyone.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.712
Screen all calls
to animal control and 911.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.520
Pull CCTV from every corner
in a ten-mile radius.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.800
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.637
- Don't listen to him.
- Sara, he's right.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.230
I never should've left Mona
in charge of those fugitives.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.678
I should've been here, and instead,
I was off gallivanting like a...

01:44.760 --> 01:45.876
Like a Legend?

01:47.920 --> 01:49.513
Look, we're on this.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.035
That Kaupe doesn't stand a chance.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.515
I'll fix this.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.157
- Our potty mouth puppet is locked up.
- Wonderful.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.920
Because I've got
another job for you, Gary.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.553
But you're not gonna like it.

02:10.919 --> 02:11.920
Ow!

02:16.480 --> 02:17.709
Mom? Dad?

02:18.480 --> 02:19.596
What's going on?

02:19.680 --> 02:21.637
You were in a cycling accident.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.799
I wasn't on a bike.
I was scratched by...

02:30.400 --> 02:31.595
Konane, let go!

02:35.880 --> 02:38.190
Oh, no. He's out there alone.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.350
Who?

02:39.440 --> 02:42.751
I can't talk about it.
It's work-related. Top secret.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.320
We have failed as parents.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.074
It's all your fault.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.274
Gary.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.192
Oh, my God. I'm happy to see you.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.715
My parents won't believe
what I really do for work.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.880
Oh, you mean betraying the people
that gave you a chance?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.396
Ava believed in you
and you let her down.

03:12.480 --> 03:13.755
You let us all down.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.998
Gary, what are you talking about?

03:16.080 --> 03:19.232
You released a dangerous beast,
and now, he's out there running free.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.596
Wait. You think I let the Kaupe out?

03:21.720 --> 03:23.120
It was the men in black.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.431
- Didn't you see the bodies?
- No.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.355
There was only footage of you
letting the hairy hunk man out.

03:29.440 --> 03:32.035
Now, there's me telling you...

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
You're fired.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.240
You can't fire me.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.876
I swear there were two men who came
for Konane, but he killed them.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.076
Sorry, Mona.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.056
I really liked you, you know,
and I know it hurts now,

03:42.080 --> 03:44.276
but in a few seconds
you won't remember a thing.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.272
Don't you dare. I need my mind!

03:46.360 --> 03:48.096
You do not have clearance
to handle this device.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.554
You can't take my memories!

03:58.320 --> 03:59.834
What was I doing here?

03:59.920 --> 04:02.355
You're here to give me your jacket.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.920
Right, right, right.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.311
And also, you were gonna
give me your time courier.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.196
Oh, yeah.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.200
Now, take my place,
it's almost lunchtime.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
Oh...

04:17.040 --> 04:18.394
Ooh!

04:18.480 --> 04:19.480
Jell-O.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.153
I know you're there.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.153
Stop following me,
or I'll turn your brain into pudding!

04:56.960 --> 04:58.076
Konane?

05:00.560 --> 05:01.914
You're alive.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.832
I was so worried they'd find you.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.277
Don't worry about that.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.919
I know you didn't mean to hurt me.

05:16.200 --> 05:17.714
It's them! Run!

05:24.880 --> 05:26.109
I won't let them get you.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.760
I'll close this behind you,
so, they won't be able to follow.

05:28.840 --> 05:31.116
- Mona.
- I have to keep you safe. Go!

05:33.560 --> 05:36.280
Mona! Mona.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.432
You're safe. We're the good guys.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.273
Oh, yeah? Who sent you?

05:41.400 --> 05:43.551
Was it the Bureau,
or the men in black?

05:43.640 --> 05:44.994
Where is the wolfman?

05:45.320 --> 05:46.720
He's gone. It's too late.

05:46.840 --> 05:49.355
You'll never find him because
I don't even know where he went.

05:49.480 --> 05:51.472
So, grill me all you want. You...

05:57.640 --> 05:58.790
What kind of gun is this?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.957
Did you just try to
"shoot her" shoot her?

06:03.320 --> 06:04.390
Any hits?

06:04.840 --> 06:07.480
I tried to isolate the portal
from today's courier activity

06:07.560 --> 06:08.914
but so far, no dice.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.832
It would help
if I had the actual courier.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.434
Sure. Here you go.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.030
Okay, never mind.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.952
So, we have a vicious monster
on the loose,

06:17.040 --> 06:19.191
and no idea
where it might have disappeared to.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.634
He's not a vicious monster.

06:20.800 --> 06:23.554
People just assume that
because of the way he looks.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.720
He's a demigod. He used to be a king.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.989
Hey, what are you doing?

06:27.080 --> 06:28.753
Seeing if this thing
works on her mouth.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.316
Or how about we just give our guest

06:31.440 --> 06:33.159
the dignity of hearing her story first.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.041
I'm telling you.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.077
The men in black are behind all of this.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.119
They're framing me, so, they can
keep hurting the magical creatures.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.435
Hurting them how?

06:43.520 --> 06:46.433
I don't know, but Konane was
terrified when they came for him.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.749
I was just trying to help him.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.038
Mona, we saw
the security footage and...

06:51.840 --> 06:54.309
There were no men in black, just you.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.113
Well, they must have altered
the footage to hide the truth.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.350
I'm like Mulder,

06:59.480 --> 07:02.154
and those guys are the shadow
government covering their tracks.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.709
It's a conspiracy.
The truth is out there!

07:04.800 --> 07:06.632
Okay, Fox, okay, Fox! Take a breath!

07:07.200 --> 07:08.475
We believe you.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.476
Right, Sara?

07:12.560 --> 07:14.756
Yes. We do.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.456
And we're gonna
get to the bottom of this,

07:16.480 --> 07:20.599
but first, we need to find the Kaupe
before he hurts himself.

07:20.760 --> 07:21.989
Can you help us do that?

07:26.240 --> 07:28.311
So, I'll head to the Bureau
and do some digging?

07:28.400 --> 07:29.516
What? No.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.512
I need you on the hunt
for that monster.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.240
- But you said...
- Exactly what I needed to say.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.551
That girl is clearly bonkers,
but the Kaupe trusts her

07:36.640 --> 07:38.199
and we need her as bait.

07:38.280 --> 07:40.112
What if she's not crazy?

07:40.200 --> 07:41.896
What if there really is
a cover-up at the Bureau?

07:41.920 --> 07:44.515
Then Ava would know about it
and she wouldn't allow it.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.035
<i>Captain, I have found
a lead on our missing Kaupe.</i>

07:47.120 --> 07:48.998
<i>In Mexico City, 1961,</i>

07:49.080 --> 07:51.436
<i>an unidentified drug cartel
member was found dead,</i>

07:51.520 --> 07:53.034
<i>apparently, the work of a wild animal</i>

07:53.160 --> 07:54.514
<i>non-indigenous to the region.</i>

07:54.600 --> 07:55.716
That must be him.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.680
All right, fine.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.160
Do some digging through the footage,
but keep your head down.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.436
- We don't wanna raise any red flags.
- Got it.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.957
Gideon, rally the troops.
We are going to Mexico.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.674
I'm picking up
a magical signature this way.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.151
As far as hiding places go, smack
bang in the center of a major city

08:17.240 --> 08:18.594
would not be my top choice.

08:19.280 --> 08:20.760
What is this place?

08:29.840 --> 08:31.991
It sounds like a real party.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.719
As long as there's beer.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.234
The detector must be wrong.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.357
There's no way Konane
could hide in a place like this.

08:38.440 --> 08:39.715
Are you sure about that?

08:40.240 --> 08:43.711
"El Lobo." The Kaupe isn't hiding.
He is the main event.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.110
Ooh!

08:55.200 --> 08:56.240
<i>Blimey.</i>

08:56.360 --> 08:57.936
How'd our hairy friend end up
with that lot?

08:57.960 --> 08:59.560
It doesn't surprise me in the slightest.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.317
Lucha libre wrestling is all about
character and charisma.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.870
The modern day morality play.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.714
Good versus evil.
The people versus the man.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.071
Well, according to
the altered historical record,

09:12.160 --> 09:13.958
El Lobo arrived on the scene
six months ago

09:14.040 --> 09:15.474
and quickly rose to the top.

09:15.560 --> 09:16.976
The mystery surrounding
his true identity

09:17.000 --> 09:19.356
inspired novels, movies and TV shows.

09:19.440 --> 09:22.512
Oh, bollocks. This is the one
that I get sidelined for?

09:22.800 --> 09:23.840
All right, let's split up.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.536
Ray and Charlie stay on the comms,
John and I will cover the arena.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.776
You guys watch from the stands.

09:30.480 --> 09:34.315
Tonight, you will witness
a spectacular match,

09:34.400 --> 09:38.076
one that you will tell your
grandchildren of in vivid detail.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.696
Hey, we're working.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.360
We can't afford any screw-ups
on this one.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.675
We gotta bag this guy quick.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.353
Gotta stay sharp, you mean.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.120
Oh, chillax, love.
El Lobo ain't going nowhere.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.472
It's true.
He's impossible to get rid of.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.917
I tried over and over. He won't go away.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.753
Hold the bloody phone.

10:05.640 --> 10:07.040
Are you El Cura?

10:07.160 --> 10:08.514
You know this guy?

10:08.600 --> 10:11.195
Anyone who knows anything
about Mexican culture knows El Cura

10:11.280 --> 10:14.352
the legendary luchador
and movie star.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.440
No.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.796
You know, I loved
your monster movies, mate.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.155
Whoever wrote those gems

10:19.240 --> 10:20.799
had a better handle on magic

10:20.880 --> 10:22.792
than any of those tosspots
up in Hollywood.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.358
I haven't been in any movies,
<i>mi amigo.</i>

10:26.000 --> 10:27.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's all this?

10:28.080 --> 10:29.992
You're the warrior of piety
and goodness.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.958
You don't drink,
not that I'm one to judge.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.874
I didn't.
Until this hairy <i>tonto</i> showed up

10:34.960 --> 10:36.120
and stole everything from me.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.072
And finally, the man... No,

10:38.160 --> 10:40.800
the legend you have
all come here to see...

10:40.880 --> 10:41.950
You mean the thief.

10:42.040 --> 10:44.509
...the undefeated champion.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.640
The hero of the people!

10:48.080 --> 10:49.594
El Lobo!

11:12.960 --> 11:15.794
We don't have eyes
on the Kaupe. He's lying low.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.714
I need this wrapped up
before tonight, Nathaniel.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.275
I can't have it hanging
over my head during the benefit.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.360
It's going to be fine.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.736
You guys have been
throwing this fundraiser

11:23.760 --> 11:25.353
since the first Bush administration.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.437
Oh, is that Nathaniel?

11:27.640 --> 11:28.856
Yes, dear. But this is a work matter.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.075
- Yes, I need...
- I...

11:30.160 --> 11:31.256
Please. Thank you. Thank you.

11:31.280 --> 11:32.475
Hello, sweetie.

11:32.560 --> 11:34.517
So, don't forget the benefit is tonight.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.016
Mom, I don't know
if I'm gonna make it this year.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.110
I have a work emergency.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.317
- Work can wait. Right, Hank?
- No.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.629
Yeah, your father is nodding.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.240
Okay, darling. See you here at 7:00.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.356
Bye.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.800
I... No...

11:44.801 --> 11:46.481
<i>The lilies go on the stage...</i>

11:56.960 --> 11:58.189
Damn, he's good.

11:58.320 --> 11:59.320
He's too good.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.351
In lucha libre,
every match tells a story.

12:03.440 --> 12:06.717
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose,
so you can rise again.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.519
But there are rules. There is a plan.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.077
With this guy, there's no rules,
there's no plan.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.640
He just wins every time.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.594
So, that's why you're here, eh,
drowning your sorrows,

12:16.680 --> 12:19.593
rather than being up there
where you belong.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.594
Listen, mate. I've had my fair share
of defeats these past days,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.110
but lying on your ass,

12:25.640 --> 12:28.075
it's no way to get your mojo back.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.516
Look at him.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.319
This is what he's always wanted.

12:46.440 --> 12:49.638
To be worshipped and admired
like the demigod he is.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.474
Not feared and shunned
like some monster.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.279
He better make the most of it.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.114
The second he gets backstage,
it's lights out

12:57.200 --> 12:58.714
and back to the Time Bureau.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.480
That wasn't the plan.
He can't go back to the Time Bureau.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.479
- It's not safe.
- Not my call. Don't care.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.239
Oh, good, it's just you.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.040
What are you doing here?

13:22.120 --> 13:23.793
I was digging.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.349
Mona claims the footage
you saw earlier was doctored.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.875
That there's a cover-up
around the creature's escape.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.639
And you believe this tiny cuckoo?

13:31.400 --> 13:32.800
Maybe you should, too.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.435
According to these deleted access logs,

13:35.520 --> 13:37.352
security footage
was removed and replaced

13:37.440 --> 13:39.160
earlier this morning
from a wireless device.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.599
Now all I have to do is figure out
who that phone number belongs to.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.514
You don't have to. I know the number.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.074
It belongs to my dad.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.632
El Lobo triumphs again!

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
<i>Okay, Mona.</i>

13:53.720 --> 13:56.456
Make sure he sees you as he leaves
the ring, then bring him backstage,

13:56.480 --> 13:57.596
and we'll meet you there.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.032
Konane!

14:13.560 --> 14:16.439
El Lobo! You thief!

14:16.600 --> 14:17.716
You cheat!

14:19.640 --> 14:21.597
You have disgraced this ring.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.040
You have stolen victories
from too many of us.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.153
And I'm going to put a stop to it.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.835
I challenge you
to a <i>lucha de apuestas!</i>

14:34.160 --> 14:36.197
The loser will take off his mask

14:36.280 --> 14:40.115
and forfeit and never set foot
in the ring ever again.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.356
You heard it here,
ladies and gentleman.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.432
The gauntlet has been thrown.

14:48.440 --> 14:52.195
Do you accept this match
and its conditions, <i>seÃ±or?</i>

15:03.840 --> 15:05.593
Then the fight is on!

15:05.680 --> 15:09.469
Tomorrow night. Same time, same place.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.836
This will be one for the history books.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.880
Get your tickets now!

15:16.840 --> 15:18.911
So, he's back on track,
historically-speaking.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.673
Now, how's that
for a bang-up job, Lancey?

15:22.240 --> 15:24.630
- Excuse me. Coming through.
- Hey, get back here.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.915
What is going on?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.390
Out of my way, fanboys. Get out!

15:31.680 --> 15:33.911
Damn it!
Mona's gonna get herself trampled.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.675
You can say what you will,
but that Kaupe,

15:46.880 --> 15:48.553
he's a real gent in my book.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.910
So, this is where you've been living.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.271
Wow!

16:02.640 --> 16:04.757
I like what you've done with the place.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.991
It's, um... It's homey.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.999
It's like you're back on the island.

16:11.280 --> 16:14.159
You miss Hawaii, don't you?

16:14.240 --> 16:15.515
Home.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.956
You miss home?

16:17.920 --> 16:18.920
Home.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.076
Mona home.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.560
Do I miss home?

16:24.960 --> 16:26.394
Eh, you know.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.149
Guilt-tripping parents, lack of a job.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.357
No one who understands me.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.678
Wow, that's beautiful.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.116
Mona.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.716
There has to be a logical reason
why Hank replaced the footage.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.950
So, let's think about it.

16:58.040 --> 17:00.475
Look, I get that you
and your dad are in a good place

17:00.560 --> 17:01.835
for the first time in a while,

17:01.920 --> 17:04.310
but we just can't ignore
that this is happening.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.960
But can we please reserve judgement
until we see the footage?

17:07.640 --> 17:10.314
Sure, uh, the original footage
can only be restored

17:10.400 --> 17:12.278
from the device used to delete it.

17:12.359 --> 17:14.875
- You mean my dad's phone?
- Yeah.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.069
We gotta go for it tonight.

17:17.640 --> 17:18.835
He's gonna be distracted.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.816
He's gonna be boozing and schmoozing
at the benefit gala.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.752
I have a plus one. Are you in?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.633
Yeah. Okay.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.296
Uh... As long as
we don't have to do that thing

17:28.319 --> 17:29.800
where we act like we're dating.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.880
You and I dating would be totally weird.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.320
Totally weird. Yeah.

17:34.400 --> 17:35.516
Um...

17:36.080 --> 17:38.834
Text me the details
and I will meet you there.

17:38.920 --> 17:39.920
Yeah.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.560
Bye.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.637
I must be really hungry because
that actually looks kind of good.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.229
What is it?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.517
Where is he, Mona?

18:07.040 --> 18:08.759
He's gone. You scared him off.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.000
We just want to make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone, love.

18:11.520 --> 18:12.749
He isn't like that.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.679
He's sweet and gentle.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.910
He won't hurt any...

18:22.520 --> 18:24.193
Eat this, you furball.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.554
Konane, stop!

18:50.240 --> 18:52.835
You got one messed-up
definition of sweet.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.713
Hey, Gideon said you...

19:01.800 --> 19:02.836
Wow.

19:03.760 --> 19:07.071
- You got a date?
- No. It's not a date.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.960
I am dressed like this

19:10.200 --> 19:12.590
because the footage
you saw at the Bureau earlier,

19:12.680 --> 19:15.957
was definitely altered. By Hank.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.112
Okay, before I do the math on this,
are you sure?

19:22.200 --> 19:24.317
Yeah, Mona was telling the truth.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.392
There is a cover-up at the Bureau.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.995
What are the chances
that Ava's wrapped up in this?

19:29.080 --> 19:33.120
Honestly, I don't know yet,
but if she's not a part of it then...

19:33.200 --> 19:34.793
She's probably in a lot of danger.

19:44.920 --> 19:45.920
Gary!

19:47.400 --> 19:50.040
Close that hospital gown,
or I will report you to HR.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.256
Where the hell have you been all day?

19:51.280 --> 19:52.919
I don't know who I am.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.952
I don't know why anything is things.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.113
I don't know where my nipple went.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.520
Where is my nipple?

19:58.600 --> 20:01.115
- Where is my nipple?
- Gary.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.200
He was so scared.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.590
I had to do something to stop them.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.674
- Where were they taking him?
- Somewhere terrible.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.558
That's why he can't
go back to the Bureau.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.280
The men in black are gonna
hurt him again or worse.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.232
Well, he can't stay in Mexico.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.757
So, take him back home.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.317
Back to ancient Hawaii,
to his old kingdom.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.194
You saw him in the arena.
He's meant to be a king.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.636
- Mona, it is not that simple.
- Why?

20:29.720 --> 20:32.110
<i>Captain, you're being
hailed by Director Sharpe.</i>

20:32.200 --> 20:33.316
That is why.

20:33.480 --> 20:34.960
Gideon, I'll take it on the bridge.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.839
<i>I'm afraid she's overridden
my security protocols.</i>

20:39.720 --> 20:42.315
Ava! Wow, look at you.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.278
- You look great.
<i>- Yeah, thanks.</i>

20:44.360 --> 20:47.398
<i>But listen, Sara, the situation
with the Kaupe has gotten much worse.</i>

20:47.480 --> 20:49.551
<i>He now has an accomplice, Mona Wu.</i>

20:49.640 --> 20:51.996
<i>Now, she may not look it,
but she is extremely dangerous.</i>

20:52.080 --> 20:53.336
<i>She completely wiped Gary's mind.</i>

20:53.360 --> 20:54.760
Um...

20:58.280 --> 21:00.696
<i>Wait, you've had Mona in custody
this whole time and you didn't...</i>

21:00.720 --> 21:03.792
It's a long story, but I need
to explain to you in person.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.080
This line might not be secure.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.998
<i>The line isn't secure, Sara,
what are you...</i>

21:10.400 --> 21:11.675
<i>You have the Kaupe, too?</i>

21:11.760 --> 21:13.479
Look, I can't explain right now.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.200
<i>Okay, then I'm sending
an extraction team.</i>

21:15.240 --> 21:16.993
Gideon, mask our location.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.151
<i>Sara, you need to bring in
that fugitive now.</i>

21:19.720 --> 21:20.790
I'm sorry.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.033
<i>Don't you dare hang up on...</i>

21:26.360 --> 21:27.555
Whoa!

21:27.680 --> 21:29.831
Did you just hang up
on your girlfriend?

21:30.800 --> 21:33.793
Mona, you better not be wrong
about this.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.357
I need to go to that benefit,
so, I can talk to Ava face-to-face.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.592
Before you leave, I have a petition
to become interim captain

21:47.680 --> 21:49.034
of the <i>Waverider</i> in your absence.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.590
I have a John Hancock from every
Legend except you.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.395
It looks like you crossed out
part of Rory's signature.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.596
Really?

21:56.160 --> 21:57.719
The team is to keep a low profile.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.634
Radio silence and absolutely
no time travel.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.834
Captain Palmer has got it covered.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.434
Interim captain.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.751
After your recent, unfortunate
misadventures in time travel,

22:11.960 --> 22:14.555
I created a team-building card game

22:14.680 --> 22:17.957
to help you learn the dos and don'ts
of our prior missions.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.473
I'm calling it...

22:23.160 --> 22:24.992
Fun way to learn
from your mistakes, right?

22:25.160 --> 22:27.800
Oh, you got to be joking.
"Vandal Savage."

22:27.920 --> 22:29.036
That's a real name.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.896
And here's me thinking that
Damien Darhk's moniker

22:30.920 --> 22:31.920
was a touch on the nose.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.376
<i>Sorry to interrupt,</i>

22:33.400 --> 22:35.596
<i>but I'm detecting
a disturbance in the timeline.</i>

22:35.680 --> 22:37.080
- Yes!
- Oh, thank God.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.736
<i>In the wake of
El Lobo's sudden disappearance</i>

22:39.760 --> 22:41.160
<i>from the lucha libre scene,</i>

22:41.240 --> 22:43.232
<i>rumors spread of government censorship.</i>

22:43.320 --> 22:44.834
<i>Country-wide protests erupted</i>

22:44.920 --> 22:47.435
<i>and dozens were killed
in the ensuing riots.</i>

22:47.520 --> 22:49.876
I'm sure we can figure
something out once Sara gets back.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.998
In the meantime, it's game time.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.469
- Oh!
- Come off it.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.672
I mean, weren't you just nattering on
about team-building experiences?

22:58.760 --> 23:01.992
Well, let's go out there
and actually fix something.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.520
Well, yeah,
but Sara said to stay put.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.914
Oh, come on, Raymundo.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.959
This isn't just important
for some dusty old history book.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.952
This is important
for the people of Mexico.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.389
All we need to do is make sure

23:12.480 --> 23:14.597
that the <i>luchas de apuesta</i>
fight goes on.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.355
And make sure that El Cura
comes out on top.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.830
- Grand finale.
- Yeah.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.995
- Oh, come on, Rage.
- Come on, Rage.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.719
Let's give the people what they want.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.638
Let's give 'em what they need.

23:31.680 --> 23:35.356
Let's prepare ourselves to wrestle!

23:39.120 --> 23:40.190
Or we could just go.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.793
Why throw such a big fancy party

23:45.920 --> 23:47.840
if you're only going to have
tiny, little treats?

23:48.200 --> 23:49.953
Nathaniel, darling.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.077
Hello. Yes.

23:54.120 --> 23:55.918
Is this your new girlfriend?

23:56.320 --> 23:58.516
- Um, yeah. This is Zari.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:58.600 --> 24:02.071
Zari. What a beautiful name
for a beautiful woman

24:02.160 --> 24:04.072
with excellent child-bearing hips.

24:04.240 --> 24:08.712
Not to put a clock on it or anything,
but grandchildren would be so lovely.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.320
Anyhoo, I'd better go make sure
everything is good

24:11.360 --> 24:12.794
with your father's speech.

24:13.720 --> 24:17.430
Oh, my God. That went well.
Are you...

24:17.560 --> 24:19.074
Are you blushing right now?

24:19.160 --> 24:22.153
No, shut up. Take my toothpick.
Stay on task.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.631
We are here to get your dad's phone.
That's it.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.155
You better have a damn good reason
for hanging up on me.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.391
Where is the Kaupe
and why isn't he in Bureau custody?

24:41.640 --> 24:44.030
- What are you doing?
- Making sure we're not overheard.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.429
By who?

24:48.320 --> 24:50.152
Sara, my ass is already on the line.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.074
Feeling me up in front of my boss
is not a good idea right now.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.112
- He didn't plant anything on you.
- What?

24:55.200 --> 24:56.759
That's good.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.677
Please tell me that nutcase Mona
hasn't gotten to you.

25:01.880 --> 25:04.031
Just dance.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.799
I think Mona was onto something

25:05.880 --> 25:08.111
about secret agents trying
to infiltrate the Bureau.

25:10.640 --> 25:11.915
That is insane.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.870
- Sara...
- Just listen to me.

25:16.280 --> 25:19.751
The security footage was altered
and I think Mona was framed.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.473
Even if that was true, which I doubt,

25:24.560 --> 25:26.313
you are still harboring a fugitive.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.517
- Ava...
- Hand him over now.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.512
We can deal with the rest of this later.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.110
You know

25:32.200 --> 25:34.078
I can't do that.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.073
Then this conversation is over.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.077
Hey, could you help me out, <i>amigo?</i>

25:43.240 --> 25:44.833
I think I might be stuck.

25:45.160 --> 25:48.517
It's time to whip you back
into fighting shape, eh, mate?

25:48.600 --> 25:50.557
Okay, you need to shake off
that ring rust

25:50.640 --> 25:52.240
by tomorrow night, so, that you can win.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.914
What the hell is he doing here?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.469
Whoa! Be nice. Be nice.

25:56.560 --> 25:58.756
Look, just as you're here
to practice winning,

25:58.880 --> 26:00.837
he's here to practice losing, all right?

26:00.920 --> 26:02.149
I don't trust him.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.879
He's never done choreography.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.356
For the people to accept me
as their hero again,

26:06.440 --> 26:08.193
my victory must be absolute.

26:08.720 --> 26:10.871
Well, you'd better get to work then,
hadn't you?

26:18.720 --> 26:20.837
Gentle, El Lobo, gentle.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.437
That's what I'm talking about, El Cura.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.396
You think he could still pull off
his finishing move?

26:47.480 --> 26:49.517
Sure, muscle memory will kick in.

26:55.640 --> 26:56.676
Konane!

27:01.200 --> 27:02.919
You can't train the mutt.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.870
Konane.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.632
I know you don't like losing,

27:07.720 --> 27:09.712
but it doesn't make you
any less of a king.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.554
In fact, it makes you a hero.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.799
Like Buck,
in my favorite Rebecca Silver book.

27:16.720 --> 27:17.836
Wait, wait, wait.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.674
Where Buck crash lands
on Garima's home planet

27:20.760 --> 27:23.798
and then is forced into mortal combat.
That one?

27:24.200 --> 27:26.157
Yeah, you've read it?

27:26.360 --> 27:27.396
Heard of it.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.711
Konane...

27:35.240 --> 27:38.358
Buck loved Garima,
and he didn't wanna hurt her sister.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.159
So, he threw the contest

27:40.280 --> 27:43.637
and the two star-crossed lovers
escaped into the night.

27:44.040 --> 27:47.670
If you lose tomorrow,
me and you can escape, too.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.399
I'll take you back to Hawaii.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.557
We can make a life together

27:51.720 --> 27:53.473
just like Buck and Garima.

27:57.640 --> 27:58.640
Let's clear out.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.030
Ava.

28:02.840 --> 28:03.876
Where are you going?

28:05.320 --> 28:07.312
Mexico City, 1961.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.113
What, you didn't think I'd find out?

28:09.400 --> 28:11.198
The Bureau is running just fine, Sara,

28:11.280 --> 28:14.318
and we will catch that damn Kaupe.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.998
On behalf of
the American Hemophilia Foundation,

28:27.080 --> 28:28.639
I am honored to introduce

28:28.760 --> 28:32.037
tonight's recipient
of the Altruistic Angel Award,

28:32.120 --> 28:33.839
Henry Heywood.

28:34.560 --> 28:36.040
Hey, Pops, Pops, Pops.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.793
How about a quick pic?

28:37.880 --> 28:40.839
You know, for Facebooks or whatever
you old people overshare on.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.513
- Come on, Mom.
- Yep.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.715
Okay, say "grandbabies."

28:51.480 --> 28:54.393
Damn it, Ray. What happened
to keeping a low profile?

28:54.480 --> 28:56.472
It's a long story,
but this fight must happen

28:56.560 --> 28:58.279
in order to protect history,

28:58.360 --> 28:59.919
so, just trust us, okay?

29:00.200 --> 29:02.256
All right, so entering through
the north and south wings

29:02.280 --> 29:04.176
is the best chance of catching
the Legends off guard.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.200
- If you...
- Oh...

29:07.840 --> 29:10.056
Uh... Should I transfer
to your private line in case it's,

29:10.080 --> 29:12.879
- you know... Bom chica wow-wow...
- Gary, move.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.117
<i>Ava, I know you're mad,
but can we please just talk</i>

29:18.200 --> 29:20.136
about this like adults
before doing something rash.

29:20.160 --> 29:21.913
I will put a stop to that fight.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.753
<i>Sara, now is not the time</i>

29:23.840 --> 29:25.656
for one of your crazy
fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants plans.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.751
Hand over the fugitive
before someone gets hurt.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.753
I know this sounds crazy,
but there is no way around it.

29:30.840 --> 29:33.719
Letting the Kaupe wrestle
is important to Mexico's history.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.031
<i>No, allowing
an escaped fugitive to fight</i>

29:36.120 --> 29:37.474
<i>is endangering all of history.</i>

29:37.560 --> 29:39.040
Extraction team, move out.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.271
<i>Introducing the fallen hero.</i>

29:41.360 --> 29:44.239
Once beloved, now disgraced,

29:44.360 --> 29:47.751
a man clawing for a comeback,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.720
El Cura!

29:56.760 --> 29:59.070
El Cura! El Cura!

30:01.080 --> 30:03.197
They're fairweather fans, mate.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.840
Don't worry, you'll prove them wrong.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.912
And now,
the man you are all here to see,

30:09.000 --> 30:11.879
the undefeated champion of the people,

30:12.640 --> 30:14.393
El Lobo!

30:26.720 --> 30:27.836
Bring it in, gentlemen.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.790
Now, I want a good, clean fight.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.998
No biting, no scratching.
Nothing below the belt.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.549
All right, to your corners.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.359
The strongest of us will never know

30:39.480 --> 30:42.075
what it's like to live
with this disorder.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.856
And that's why I called my work...

30:43.880 --> 30:46.270
Okay, moment of truth.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.472
Because victory is possible.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.439
In fact, it's inevitable.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.351
I don't accept this
Altruistic Angel Award for myself

30:58.440 --> 30:59.999
as some pat on the back.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.515
I receive it as a call to arms.

31:03.880 --> 31:07.271
Let's all come together
and end this fight.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.280
Oh!

31:11.760 --> 31:13.592
All right, take it easy, remember?

31:13.680 --> 31:15.478
Come on, shake it off, mate,
shake it off.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.336
Look, I know you feel like throwing
in the towel right now, but trust me,

31:18.360 --> 31:21.432
there's nothing people like more
than a good comeback. Now go.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.472
You're losing so good. Keep it up.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.074
Play dead, furball.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.713
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is an emergency evacuation.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.712
Please exit the building
in an orderly fashion.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.590
We have some
uninvited guests here, Sara.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.631
Give them hell. That's an order.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.274
No outside interference.

32:32.360 --> 32:33.999
Finally, a real fight!

32:45.240 --> 32:47.516
These fools are trying to censor us.

32:47.600 --> 32:50.434
But we ain't gonna stand
for that, are we?

32:54.880 --> 32:56.030
On your left, mate.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.760
Nice one, Raymundo.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.752
Now, El Cura and his mates

33:06.040 --> 33:08.236
they fight for the people.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.872
The people!

33:11.320 --> 33:14.392
Now, this is what I call
a bloody good show.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.194
He didn't abandon you!

33:16.280 --> 33:17.280
Have a towel, mate.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.000
So, don't you dare abandon him!

33:22.960 --> 33:24.997
Whoa!

33:25.080 --> 33:26.514
Come on!

33:46.240 --> 33:47.720
Yeah!

33:48.880 --> 33:49.996
Yeah! Yeah!

33:53.600 --> 33:54.716
Cura!

33:59.880 --> 34:02.190
Cura! Cura! Cura!

34:18.440 --> 34:22.228
I reckon we should team-build
like this more often, Legends.

34:24.920 --> 34:28.231
<i>Well, looks like you've saved
history again.</i>

34:28.600 --> 34:30.114
Congratulations, Sara.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.676
- Ava, just let me explain...
- No need.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.119
It's all very clear to me.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.516
Ava, please don't hang up...

34:39.360 --> 34:40.679
On me.

34:51.719 --> 34:52.995
Some night, huh?

34:53.080 --> 34:56.357
We just raised over $500,000.

34:56.440 --> 34:57.510
Roaring success.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.760
I saw the footage, Hank.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.636
The real footage.

35:07.360 --> 35:11.559
Nathaniel, it was you who convinced
me to fund the Bureau.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.915
Don't...

35:13.320 --> 35:14.720
Please don't remind me.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.673
I went out on a limb for you.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.072
I need you to trust me on this.
There's a purpose to what you saw.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.278
Of course, I trust you.

35:34.480 --> 35:37.757
I just need you to bring me in
on these sort of things.

35:38.560 --> 35:40.836
In due time, son.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.590
I got to take this.

35:42.680 --> 35:43.796
Yeah.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.277
You cloned all the data
off that phone, right?

35:49.320 --> 35:50.470
Uh-huh.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.755
Good.

35:52.600 --> 35:53.750
Keep digging.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.360
I wanna know everything.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.351
What do you mean
you couldn't capture the asset?

36:01.440 --> 36:04.000
<i>Blame it on your son's
time-traveling pals, sir.</i>

36:04.080 --> 36:05.514
<i>How would you like us to proceed?</i>

36:14.720 --> 36:16.871
Kid, come here.

36:21.800 --> 36:24.395
There's something about Buck
and Garima you should know.

36:24.640 --> 36:26.233
They didn't live happily ever after.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.757
They came from two different worlds.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.594
Worlds that needed them.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.200
They didn't belong together,

36:36.160 --> 36:37.355
but they loved one another...

36:38.680 --> 36:39.796
A lot.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.310
How do you know?

36:42.400 --> 36:45.040
The next book in the series
hasn't even been published yet.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.270
I just do!

36:48.560 --> 36:49.560
Here.

36:51.920 --> 36:53.274
Don't do anything stupid.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.240
I'm gonna take a leak.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.633
I brought snickerdoodles.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.754
I'll just, um, put them here.

37:26.920 --> 37:29.992
Ava, look, I'm sorry.
I didn't come here to fight.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.559
I know things got ugly between us today,

37:34.960 --> 37:36.838
but I just wanna put it behind us.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.995
I needed one thing
from you today, Sara.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.117
For you to be in my corner.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.316
That's all I asked.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.030
Well, I'm here now.

37:45.120 --> 37:46.713
Well, that's great.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.400
Just in time for my meeting with Hank,

37:48.480 --> 37:50.597
where I'll probably be fired,
thanks to you.

37:51.280 --> 37:55.194
Ava, Hank is the real problem here.

37:55.280 --> 37:58.034
I mean, he's been
torturing prisoners off-site...

37:58.160 --> 37:59.276
Who cares?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.591
A few weeks ago, the Legends
were sending them to hell.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.791
I mean, since when
is protecting magical creatures,

38:03.880 --> 38:05.696
things that shouldn't even be
in our world in the first place,

38:05.720 --> 38:07.279
more important than protecting me?

38:07.360 --> 38:08.953
And when have you become so callous

38:09.040 --> 38:10.793
about the prisoners in your care?

38:10.880 --> 38:14.590
My priority is to protect history, Sara.

38:14.680 --> 38:16.034
Human history.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.550
If Hank has to experiment
on a few creatures

38:18.640 --> 38:20.880
to try to find a better way
to fight them, then so be it.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.677
Ava, you do not believe that.

38:23.960 --> 38:26.031
Come on, I know you.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.474
You're not like Hank.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.914
Look, this is your Bureau

38:29.000 --> 38:30.600
and he's doing
something twisted with it.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.839
You don't understand
how any of this works.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.912
No, Hank is the reason
that this Bureau is here.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.456
If we piss him off, it all goes away.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.551
Think of how many people,
how many human people

38:38.640 --> 38:41.200
- would get hurt if that happened.
- Well, he can't shut us down.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.031
Oh, my God!
Sara, everything is not about you.

38:45.120 --> 38:48.318
Do you understand you're asking me
to risk everything?

38:48.400 --> 38:51.677
For what? For some conspiracy theory?
For a bunch of monsters? I'd...

38:53.160 --> 38:54.355
For me.

38:57.080 --> 39:00.835
Well, I've already given you
everything I have to give. So...

39:02.960 --> 39:04.633
Today, I asked you for one thing.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.560
Ava, don't do this.

39:06.640 --> 39:07.710
Just go.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.152
I'm done.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.876
Well, Konane,
it's time for our new adventure.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.754
Konane, I, uh...

39:53.280 --> 39:54.475
I can't.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.752
I wanna live in your world.

39:58.040 --> 40:01.033
I mean, look at it.

40:02.160 --> 40:03.753
It's beautiful.

40:05.560 --> 40:07.517
But I don't belong there.

40:10.480 --> 40:13.871
If I went, I'd just be
running away from my world,

40:14.240 --> 40:17.836
and that's not the right reason
to leave everything behind.

40:40.360 --> 40:43.114
- You murdered him.
- Step away from the creature, miss.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.240
No.

40:44.320 --> 40:47.119
I said step away.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.476
You murdered him!

41:46.320 --> 41:47.436
What the...

41:53.600 --> 41:55.796
You were right.

41:55.880 --> 41:59.191
There's no such thing
as happily ever after.
