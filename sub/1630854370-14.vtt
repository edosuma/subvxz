WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:12.103 --> 00:14.586
This show has
touched so many hearts.

00:14.586 --> 00:18.758
And it's been my privilege to
play Anne for the last 25 years.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.517
Do you want
another angle?

00:21.517 --> 00:22.275
Yeah?

00:25.724 --> 00:27.517
Hey
Tegan, over here!

00:27.517 --> 00:30.172
Why'd you make the jump
from reality TV to theatre?

00:30.172 --> 00:30.965
Oh!

00:30.965 --> 00:32.310
I just always
wanted to try it.

00:32.310 --> 00:34.172
Now make sure
you get one of the girls

00:34.172 --> 00:37.310
with our brilliant director!

00:39.517 --> 00:40.413
And our Thursday show-

00:40.413 --> 00:42.931
is almost sold out.

00:42.931 --> 00:44.206
I put it in
your piece

00:44.206 --> 00:47.896
that people should get their
tickets while they still can.

00:47.896 --> 00:48.655
All right, now-

00:48.655 --> 00:52.344
one of just me
and Tegan, yeah?

00:52.344 --> 00:54.448
You can't be serious.

00:54.448 --> 00:57.724
I'm being upstaged by
a reality show reject?

00:59.068 --> 01:00.275
Actors.

01:02.034 --> 01:02.827
Thanks everybody!

01:02.827 --> 01:03.793
That's it
for photo call.

01:04.724 --> 01:05.413
Are you ready?

01:05.413 --> 01:06.275
LX three
going out!

01:06.275 --> 01:07.413
Yeah.

01:07.827 --> 01:10.034
Dress rehearsal
starts in fifteen.

01:10.034 --> 01:11.827
Mr. Frecker,
before you go-

01:11.827 --> 01:13.724
who's this week's
celebrity walk-on?

01:13.724 --> 01:15.310
Well I don't want to
give away our secrets.

01:15.310 --> 01:17.103
But if you
buy a ticket-

01:17.103 --> 01:19.931
I promise you that you
will not be disappointed.

01:19.931 --> 01:20.827
See you Thursday.

01:21.689 --> 01:22.724
Thank you.

01:22.724 --> 01:24.172
Can we just get another
shot of the house here?

01:24.172 --> 01:26.413
The tip of the
tongue the teeth and the lips.

01:26.413 --> 01:28.137
The tip of the tongue
the teeth and the lips.

01:28.137 --> 01:29.689
The tip of the tongue
the teeth and the-

01:29.689 --> 01:31.379
Don't mind me!

01:31.379 --> 01:34.724
Got to replace that burnt
out bulb now the once.

01:34.724 --> 01:35.758
Sure.

01:36.586 --> 01:38.310
The tip of the tongue
the teeth and the lips.

01:38.310 --> 01:39.862
The tip of the tongue
the teeth and the-

01:50.172 --> 01:51.344
You take your time.

01:57.379 --> 01:58.068
Oh!

01:58.068 --> 01:58.862
Good luck!

01:58.862 --> 01:59.758
Actually, Jesse-

01:59.758 --> 02:01.482
we don't say good luck
in the theatre.

02:01.482 --> 02:02.586
We say
break a leg.

02:02.586 --> 02:03.241
Oh right!

02:03.241 --> 02:03.931
Sorry.

02:03.931 --> 02:05.068
Yeah break a leg.

02:05.068 --> 02:06.034
Obviously.

02:06.034 --> 02:06.724
Could have been worse.

02:06.724 --> 02:07.655
I could have
said Macbeth.

02:10.482 --> 02:11.379
Rex says
break a leg.

02:11.379 --> 02:12.517
Oh thanks buddy!

02:14.827 --> 02:16.034
Joe.

02:16.034 --> 02:18.000
It's so cool that they invited
you to take part in this.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.896
Yeah it's actually great to
get back to my theatre roots-

02:19.896 --> 02:22.206
and just do a little bit
of PR for the department.

02:22.206 --> 02:24.344
Well if you're photographed
with Tegan Mansfield-

02:24.344 --> 02:25.620
you'll be in all
the gossip blogs.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.620
You say that
like it's a good thing.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.137
I seriously hope
she doesn't ruin it.

02:29.137 --> 02:30.793
Jesse's obsessed
with the show.

02:30.793 --> 02:31.862
He goes like
every year.

02:31.862 --> 02:32.827
Yeah I don't understand.

02:32.827 --> 02:34.586
Why do they do the
same show every year?

02:34.586 --> 02:35.413
It's tradition okay?

02:35.413 --> 02:36.551
It's tradition.

02:36.551 --> 02:37.689
It's like the Anne of Green
Gables of Newfoundland.

02:37.689 --> 02:39.482
It's the first show I saw
when I moved here.

02:39.482 --> 02:41.620
He's going to
see it again next week.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.482
I think-

02:42.482 --> 02:43.689
he's got a crush
on the leading lady.

02:43.689 --> 02:44.448
I do not!

02:44.448 --> 02:45.862
Jesse, you know
all the lines.

02:45.862 --> 02:48.586
Oh, I doubt he knows
all these ones!

02:48.586 --> 02:49.793
It's a good few
changes this year.

02:51.310 --> 02:52.620
You're in for a
surprise, my son.

02:53.482 --> 02:54.689
What does he
mean by changes?

02:54.793 --> 02:55.689
Uh- just-

02:55.896 --> 02:57.103
This is your
five minute call.

02:57.206 --> 02:58.620
Five minutes please.

02:58.620 --> 02:59.827
Thank you.

02:59.827 --> 03:01.551
Okay, we should
take our seats!

03:01.551 --> 03:02.931
Why are you dressed
like a pirate too?

03:02.931 --> 03:04.448
I'll see you after
the show Jesse.

03:04.448 --> 03:05.137
Okay.

03:06.275 --> 03:07.103
Come on pal.

03:08.137 --> 03:09.689
The tip of the tounge
the teeth and the lips

03:12.758 --> 03:13.620
Excuse me, sorry.

03:17.896 --> 03:21.034
Friends, family, press.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.724
Welcome to our sneak
peek dress rehearsal

03:23.724 --> 03:28.379
of The Shipwreck of the
Despatch's 25th year!

03:28.379 --> 03:30.448
I am producer
Samuel Frecker.

03:30.448 --> 03:34.344
And this is our
director, Lois Labonte.

03:37.206 --> 03:40.275
You privileged few
are first to see

03:40.275 --> 03:43.827
the new, untold story
of the Despatch.

03:43.827 --> 03:47.068
And even more
interestingly is that

03:47.068 --> 03:48.344
after this year's
local run-

03:48.344 --> 03:52.275
we will be taking the show on
its first ever national tour!

03:54.551 --> 03:56.344
Would you like to
say a few words?

03:59.068 --> 04:00.379
Chekhov would say-

04:00.379 --> 04:04.379
there is nothing new
in art except talent.

04:06.172 --> 04:06.862
Right.

04:06.862 --> 04:08.655
Well, without further ado-!

04:19.172 --> 04:20.655
Londonderry.

04:20.655 --> 04:23.172
1828.

04:23.172 --> 04:25.103
Two hundred
souls set sail

04:25.103 --> 04:26.586
in search of a better
life in Quebec.

04:26.586 --> 04:27.275
Ah!

04:27.862 --> 04:29.103
He's good!

04:29.103 --> 04:33.862
But little did they know that
I would cause them to wreck.

04:56.137 --> 04:57.000
Wow.

04:59.034 --> 05:01.758
Um- so this is the
show you love?

05:02.206 --> 05:03.482
Definitely not.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.965
Stirring choreography isn't it?

05:13.620 --> 05:14.275
Sure!

05:22.758 --> 05:23.827
Deep-!

05:23.827 --> 05:26.517
in the belly of
this terrible gale-

05:26.517 --> 05:30.172
let dread Pirate Lancaster
tell you a tale.

05:30.172 --> 05:34.137
For never a more compelling
tale will you catch

05:34.137 --> 05:38.000
than that of the shipwreck
of The Despatch!

05:40.448 --> 05:44.172
One household in
the Isle of the Dead

05:44.172 --> 05:48.034
saved hundreds from
an ocean grave-bed!

05:52.931 --> 05:54.000
Anne!

06:00.275 --> 06:02.000
And Thomasina!

06:03.551 --> 06:04.965
With Hairy Man,
her dog-

06:08.172 --> 06:11.758
will guide us through
this story's fog.

06:15.137 --> 06:17.103
Okay well at least they
still have Hairy Man.

06:19.275 --> 06:20.793
Thomasina!

06:20.793 --> 06:22.862
There's been a big
wreck offshore!

06:22.862 --> 06:24.551
Ready the rowboat!

06:25.344 --> 06:26.827
I said, ready the
rowboat, Tommy!

06:26.827 --> 06:28.413
Oh, readying the rowboat!

06:32.241 --> 06:32.896
Shhh.

06:32.896 --> 06:33.793
Not now pal.

06:44.793 --> 06:45.827
Oh my God!

06:57.517 --> 06:58.689
Oh my- !

07:11.896 --> 07:13.517
I can't believe
she's gone!

07:15.517 --> 07:17.482
She was such
a sweet girl-

07:17.896 --> 07:19.862
even if she didn't
know her lines!

07:20.793 --> 07:21.413
Here.

07:21.413 --> 07:22.103
Oh!

07:22.103 --> 07:22.793
It's just awful.

07:22.793 --> 07:23.931
Thank you!

07:25.206 --> 07:26.586
There was nothing
we could have done.

07:26.586 --> 07:27.965
She was killed instantly.

07:28.827 --> 07:30.172
Hmmm.

07:31.206 --> 07:31.827
Find it.

07:31.827 --> 07:32.655
Come on.

07:33.310 --> 07:34.448
Excuse me.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.586
Do you have any idea
what happened?

07:37.586 --> 07:39.034
It was working
perfectly this morning!

07:39.034 --> 07:40.241
But when I called
the cue tonight-

07:40.241 --> 07:42.137
it's like the boat
had a mind of its own.

07:42.137 --> 07:43.724
It just crashed!

07:43.724 --> 07:45.620
You ever have a problem
like this before?

07:45.620 --> 07:47.034
Never!

07:47.034 --> 07:49.206
I check everything
before every run!

07:49.206 --> 07:50.551
You did a
check tonight?

07:52.103 --> 07:53.758
Not since the tech
run this morning!

07:53.758 --> 07:57.275
Frecker had me changing
lighting cues all day!

07:57.275 --> 08:00.586
And with all of his changes
I just didn't have time to-

08:00.586 --> 08:02.862
It's been a bit of a
disorganized process.

08:02.862 --> 08:04.655
That's not an excuse!

08:04.655 --> 08:06.931
These actors trust me
to keep them safe!

08:08.000 --> 08:09.310
I failed them!

08:13.172 --> 08:14.172
You know Charlie-

08:14.172 --> 08:17.000
Frecker's been changing
things all the time.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.172
I've been
rehearsing all week

08:18.172 --> 08:20.310
for what was supposed to
have just been a walk on part.

08:23.310 --> 08:25.275
Tegan died.

08:25.275 --> 08:26.620
Died doing
what she loved.

08:27.827 --> 08:30.103
In light of
this tragedy-

08:30.103 --> 08:31.103
We're cancelling the show?

08:31.103 --> 08:32.413
Somebody's dead.

08:32.413 --> 08:34.068
We need to do
an investigation.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.275
I don't want anybody
on the stage.

08:35.275 --> 08:36.482
I don't want anybody
touching the fly

08:36.482 --> 08:37.482
until we give
the go ahead.

08:37.482 --> 08:38.448
Of course.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.655
Nothing will be touched
on the fly system

08:39.655 --> 08:40.689
until we do
a full check.

08:40.689 --> 08:42.896
But the show
must go on!

08:42.896 --> 08:44.517
We open
in two days!

08:44.517 --> 08:46.137
I don't think you
understand Mr. Frecker.

08:46.137 --> 08:47.793
What Detective Hudson
is trying to tell you

08:47.793 --> 08:49.793
is that this show does not
go on without our say-so.

08:49.793 --> 08:52.103
We shall prepare
for the best.

08:53.413 --> 08:56.137
Rehearsal starts
at ten tomorrow.

08:56.137 --> 08:57.862
It's what Tegan
would have wanted.

09:00.827 --> 09:03.379
I think Tegan would
have wanted to live.

09:11.517 --> 09:12.655
Can I come
through with you?

09:12.655 --> 09:14.379
I need to take a
look at the fly lines.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.241
I'm afraid this area is
off-limits for now.

09:16.241 --> 09:17.655
It just-

09:18.206 --> 09:19.517
I don't know how
this happened!

09:20.310 --> 09:22.896
We're going to figure out
what went wrong, I promise.

09:27.551 --> 09:29.724
Uh- do you know
what this is?

09:29.724 --> 09:32.068
It's a record of the install
and my safety checks-

09:32.068 --> 09:33.655
how many weights
on each line-

09:33.655 --> 09:34.689
the time I last
checked them-

09:34.689 --> 09:36.241
the condition they're in.

09:36.344 --> 09:39.344
Okay I'm going to
need to borrow this.

09:39.344 --> 09:40.551
How much did the
rowboat weigh?

09:40.551 --> 09:43.310
317 pounds.

09:44.034 --> 09:44.965
And the counterweights

09:44.965 --> 09:46.413
are supposed to
balance the set piece.

09:46.413 --> 09:47.413
Right?

09:47.413 --> 09:48.689
Yes.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.862
They make it so the line doesn't
move unless you pull on it-

09:50.862 --> 09:52.344
even if you
release the brake.

09:52.344 --> 09:53.862
Who would have
been in this area

09:53.862 --> 09:55.517
between the safety
check and the dress?

09:55.517 --> 09:57.551
Anyone in the
theatre has access.

09:57.551 --> 09:59.517
And where were you?

09:59.517 --> 10:01.758
Running lighting cues
with the designer.

10:01.758 --> 10:04.344
And then the
photo call.

10:04.344 --> 10:05.034
Why?

10:06.379 --> 10:07.517
You've had
quite a shock.

10:07.517 --> 10:09.068
You should
get some rest.

10:09.068 --> 10:10.241
Thank you
for your help.

10:23.068 --> 10:23.724
Hey Sarah.

10:24.689 --> 10:25.793
You find anything?

10:25.793 --> 10:29.137
Yeah the line holding
the rowboat was unbalanced.

10:29.137 --> 10:30.241
I think that's
why it crashed.

10:32.172 --> 10:33.379
That's a pretty
big oversight.

10:33.482 --> 10:34.655
Unless it's not.

10:34.655 --> 10:35.896
There's 150
pounds less here

10:35.896 --> 10:38.000
than is listed
in these records

10:38.000 --> 10:39.241
from the install
and safety check.

10:39.241 --> 10:40.379
So if that's correct-

10:40.379 --> 10:41.724
Then someone
removed the weights

10:41.724 --> 10:42.931
between this morning
and tonight?

10:42.931 --> 10:44.206
Pretty hard to remove

10:44.206 --> 10:45.413
150 pounds-

10:45.413 --> 10:46.241
Yeah.

10:46.241 --> 10:47.379
by accident.

10:49.379 --> 10:50.827
So what we're
looking at is murder.

11:03.206 --> 11:04.931
Well I don't care
if nobody likes me.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.206
I'm not here
to make friends.

11:06.206 --> 11:07.758
I'm here to win.

11:07.758 --> 11:09.413
You don't win
by making friends-

11:09.413 --> 11:10.172
and being sweet-

11:10.172 --> 11:12.482
and making alliances.

11:12.482 --> 11:15.206
You win by pretending
to make alliances.

11:15.206 --> 11:17.482
And then at the
perfect moment-

11:17.482 --> 11:18.551
stabbing them
in the back-

11:18.551 --> 11:19.827
so that I
go further.

11:19.827 --> 11:21.034
This is right after
the episode

11:21.034 --> 11:22.379
where Tegan tries to
steal Krissy's boyfriend

11:22.379 --> 11:23.758
in the hot tub
by taking off her-

11:24.448 --> 11:25.344
Morning!

11:25.344 --> 11:27.586
Hi, we're just
researching the victim.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.758
She seems like someone who
may have had a few enemies.

11:29.758 --> 11:31.689
Don't make
assumptions, Jesse.

11:31.689 --> 11:33.689
Reality shows
are not real.

11:33.689 --> 11:35.413
Producers and editors pump
up the drama for ratings.

11:35.413 --> 11:36.517
Everyone has a persona.

11:36.517 --> 11:37.206
I'm not assuming!

11:37.206 --> 11:38.172
I'm just-

11:38.172 --> 11:40.310
you know- identifying
potential suspects.

11:40.310 --> 11:41.655
Right.

11:41.655 --> 11:43.034
Do you have fingerprints
on the fly system?

11:43.034 --> 11:44.103
No.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.448
I'm going to meet Charlie
and Rex at the theatre-

11:45.448 --> 11:47.172
see if I can find the
weights that are missing.

11:47.172 --> 11:48.586
And take a look at
Tegan's dressing room.

11:48.586 --> 11:50.137
Okay- she may have had
a few enemies there.

11:50.137 --> 11:51.103
On that note-

11:51.103 --> 11:54.206
the sound technician
recorded some rehearsals

11:54.206 --> 11:55.724
to help Tegan
learn her lines.

11:55.724 --> 11:58.655
So I am going to see
what sort of juicy gossip-

11:58.655 --> 11:59.344
I mean leads-

12:00.655 --> 12:02.172
I can find
on it.

12:02.172 --> 12:03.241
Okay.

12:03.241 --> 12:04.793
In the meantime, I'm going
to go back to rehearsal

12:04.793 --> 12:06.413
while they train
Tegan's understudy.

12:06.413 --> 12:08.275
I just want to keep
an eye on things.

12:08.275 --> 12:09.793
The show's not cancelled?

12:09.793 --> 12:12.206
I mean social media is blowing
up about Tegan's death.

12:12.206 --> 12:13.620
No not yet.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.000
And I don't want
it to get out

12:15.000 --> 12:16.172
that this is a murder investigation.

12:16.172 --> 12:18.068
Last thing I want is the
media jumping all over that.

12:19.310 --> 12:20.379
Okay, let's go.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.793
Well that's thorough.

12:35.793 --> 12:39.310
Marly's got a real
penchant for safety.

12:39.310 --> 12:42.206
Sin she couldn't enforce
the same attention for detail

12:42.206 --> 12:44.620
when it comes to
historical accuracy.

12:44.620 --> 12:45.310
I know!

12:45.310 --> 12:45.965
I know, right?

12:45.965 --> 12:46.620
I mean Thomasina?

12:46.620 --> 12:47.448
Come on!

12:47.448 --> 12:48.413
Anne's supposed
to have a brother!

12:49.310 --> 12:51.103
And you only saw
the first five minutes.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.103
Yeah, 48 people died.

12:52.103 --> 12:54.896
It just changes the
story so much, I mean-

12:54.896 --> 12:55.931
I hear you.

12:56.620 --> 12:57.620
Some shockin'

12:57.620 --> 12:59.034
Can I ask you
something?

12:59.034 --> 13:01.758
Did you see anyone backstage
near the fly yesterday

13:01.758 --> 13:02.896
before the accident?

13:02.896 --> 13:04.413
It was a dress rehearsal.

13:04.413 --> 13:06.000
Sure, everybody was there.

13:08.724 --> 13:10.172
So everyone's a suspect.

13:16.172 --> 13:16.931
Track it.

13:22.689 --> 13:24.310
Guys, you've got
to hear this.

13:24.310 --> 13:25.000
You find something?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.068
Oh did I!

13:26.068 --> 13:27.758
Yeah the sound technician
left the actors' mics on

13:27.758 --> 13:28.724
for twenty minutes

13:28.724 --> 13:29.689
after rehearsal ended.

13:29.689 --> 13:30.724
It's like its own
reality show!

13:31.413 --> 13:32.172
Listen to this.

13:32.896 --> 13:33.965
No Sam.

13:33.965 --> 13:34.862
I'm done waiting.

13:34.862 --> 13:36.413
We've
talked about this.

13:36.413 --> 13:37.241
You need
to tell her!

13:37.241 --> 13:37.931
I will.

13:37.931 --> 13:39.655
Just not yet.

13:39.655 --> 13:40.724
You have to
give me time!

13:41.724 --> 13:43.241
That's Tegan's voice.

13:43.241 --> 13:44.000
She said Sam.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
She's talking to Frecker.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.172
Yeah but who's her?

13:46.172 --> 13:47.655
And what does
she need to know?

13:54.241 --> 13:55.310
Sarah?

13:59.068 --> 14:01.241
That's an odd spot
to keep a script.

14:03.413 --> 14:05.620
I can
see why.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.068
Tegan has all of Anne's
lines highlighted.

14:07.068 --> 14:09.931
You think Tegan was trying
to take over Joy's role?

14:09.931 --> 14:11.379
Could Tegan have
been pushing Frecker

14:11.379 --> 14:13.689
to tell Joy that he was taking
the lead role away from her?

14:13.689 --> 14:14.689
If that's the case-

14:14.689 --> 14:18.413
maybe Joy decided it
was curtains for Tegan.

14:21.896 --> 14:23.413
I killed the captain!

14:23.724 --> 14:25.206
And he was
my brother!

14:25.206 --> 14:27.413
You think I won't
kill you too, maiden?

14:28.137 --> 14:30.103
I think it
can go bigger.

14:30.103 --> 14:30.965
Are you serious?

14:30.965 --> 14:31.896
Bigger than that?

14:31.896 --> 14:34.517
Just do what feels right
for the character.

14:34.517 --> 14:35.586
Yes but-

14:35.586 --> 14:36.310
pump up the drama.

14:36.310 --> 14:36.965
This is theatre-

14:36.965 --> 14:37.620
Right.

14:37.620 --> 14:38.344
after all!

14:38.344 --> 14:39.448
But remember
to act natural!

14:41.551 --> 14:42.448
Oh I didn't know-

14:42.448 --> 14:43.862
it was bring your
pet to work day!

14:45.068 --> 14:46.172
He's not a pet.

14:46.172 --> 14:48.275
He's a highly-trained
law enforcement animal.

14:48.275 --> 14:49.413
Anyway.

14:49.413 --> 14:51.172
You guys have had a lot
of change in the production.

14:51.172 --> 14:52.275
I thought maybe
you could Rex-

14:52.275 --> 14:54.241
instead of the
stuffed dog.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.827
Right!

14:55.827 --> 14:56.655
Yes, I think

14:56.655 --> 14:59.206
having a real-life
scene partner

14:59.206 --> 15:02.586
would really make my
performance more realistic.

15:02.586 --> 15:04.758
Interesting!

15:04.758 --> 15:06.586
Can he take direction?

15:06.586 --> 15:08.103
Can he?

15:08.103 --> 15:08.793
Rex!

15:10.517 --> 15:11.379
Save the passengers.

15:21.931 --> 15:22.758
He's perfect!

15:24.034 --> 15:25.758
You know what?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.206
Whatever you want!

15:27.206 --> 15:29.862
Let slip the
dogs of war!

15:31.551 --> 15:33.034
Got her all
fixed up!

15:33.034 --> 15:35.413
Now there will be
absolutely no flying!

15:35.413 --> 15:37.448
The boat is just
going to glide in!

15:37.448 --> 15:39.172
Now Joe, we're going to have
to change your blocking.

15:41.034 --> 15:42.448
Good job partner.

15:44.896 --> 15:46.931
People are going to be careful
what they say around Joe.

15:46.931 --> 15:50.620
So you've got to be our
extra eyes and ears.

15:54.517 --> 15:55.413
Okay?

16:04.344 --> 16:05.413
Excuse me, Ms. Jamieson?

16:05.413 --> 16:06.413
Can I have
a word?

16:06.413 --> 16:08.034
Anything for a fan.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.241
Especially a handsome one.

16:13.241 --> 16:14.655
Oh wow.

16:14.655 --> 16:16.034
Our 20th performance.

16:16.034 --> 16:17.103
That was a
good one!

16:18.310 --> 16:19.000
You were there?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.379
Yeah yeah,
you know what?

16:20.379 --> 16:21.689
I have been
every year since.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.586
I really can't imagine anyone
else in the role of Anne.

16:24.586 --> 16:25.758
Oh.

16:25.758 --> 16:27.517
Well you won't
have to soon.

16:28.724 --> 16:30.689
They're replacing me
after the local run.

16:32.172 --> 16:33.241
I-

16:34.551 --> 16:35.482
I can't believe they'd do that
to you after all these years!

16:36.862 --> 16:39.034
All these years
playing a 17-year-old?

16:39.034 --> 16:41.000
Tegan would have been

16:41.000 --> 16:43.034
a more age-
appropriate Anne.

16:43.034 --> 16:43.965
Well, I mean-

16:43.965 --> 16:45.103
she's no Joy Jamieson!

16:45.103 --> 16:45.758
Well-

16:45.758 --> 16:46.724
Come on!

16:48.344 --> 16:49.758
And you're okay
giving up the part?

16:49.758 --> 16:50.413
Mm-hmm.

16:50.413 --> 16:51.827
I am.

16:52.620 --> 16:53.620
I mean I
wasn't thrilled

16:53.620 --> 16:55.068
they were giving it to
someone so green, but-

16:55.068 --> 16:59.000
Yeah I mean Tegan did
seem inexperienced.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.379
Yeah.

17:00.379 --> 17:02.310
I noticed you pushed
her last night.

17:03.724 --> 17:05.241
She couldn't
find her mark.

17:07.724 --> 17:10.137
Honestly, I don't
want to tour.

17:10.137 --> 17:12.655
I love my life
in Newfoundland.

17:12.655 --> 17:14.137
My family is here.

17:14.137 --> 17:17.034
And I have a new
show coming up.

17:19.586 --> 17:20.517
I'm sorry.

17:20.517 --> 17:21.689
I um-

17:23.103 --> 17:24.310
I've love this show.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.000
And-

17:26.793 --> 17:28.068
to leave-

17:28.068 --> 17:31.724
like after all this time, with
this just terrible tragedy-

17:31.724 --> 17:33.068
It's-

17:36.310 --> 17:38.068
Sneaking out
of rehearsal early?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.137
Frecker can finish it.

17:41.482 --> 17:43.000
I wanted to ask you
a couple of questions.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.344
Um-

17:44.344 --> 17:47.862
What did you think
of Tegan as an actor?

17:48.655 --> 17:50.448
That's of concern
to the SJPD?

17:50.448 --> 17:52.000
It's of
concern to me.

17:53.137 --> 17:57.137
I felt she had a lot
of water in her soul.

17:57.137 --> 17:59.275
What does that mean?

17:59.275 --> 18:00.827
It's the
opposite of fire.

18:01.137 --> 18:02.862
Oh so if people
were thinking

18:02.862 --> 18:04.448
that you cast her
in a national tour-

18:04.448 --> 18:06.448
that would be
pretty frustrating.

18:06.448 --> 18:08.413
Yeah, it was.

18:08.413 --> 18:11.000
But my opinion on the subject
didn't seem to matter.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.103
It's Frecker's
world after all.

18:12.103 --> 18:13.517
The rest of us
just live in it.

18:13.517 --> 18:15.206
How very
Zen of you.

18:17.103 --> 18:18.724
Has Frecker always been
such a hands-on producer?

18:18.724 --> 18:20.241
Hardly.

18:20.241 --> 18:23.034
He's taken a sudden interest
since he was bewitched.

18:23.034 --> 18:27.206
You mean by the lure
of Tegan's celebrity?

18:27.206 --> 18:30.413
Call it that
if you want.

18:30.413 --> 18:31.586
I'm not one
for television.

18:31.586 --> 18:33.379
But I've seen
the girl's show.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.068
She had ways

18:34.068 --> 18:35.586
of getting
what she wanted.

18:35.586 --> 18:36.862
And besides-

18:36.862 --> 18:39.068
Frecker's always had
a thing for blondes.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.379
TV Announcer: This fall-

18:47.379 --> 18:53.379
we're getting ready to shack
up on Bungalow of Love.

18:53.379 --> 18:54.551
Sarah.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.827
Hey, you find anything out
about the counterweights?

18:56.827 --> 18:59.517
The missing 150 pounds
from the rowboat

18:59.517 --> 19:00.896
are still unaccounted for.

19:00.896 --> 19:02.620
Maybe the killer
took them off site?

19:02.620 --> 19:04.034
Mmm.

19:04.034 --> 19:07.137
All these hours of
watching Tegan on screen-

19:07.137 --> 19:09.034
only for her story to
end right in front of us.

19:09.034 --> 19:10.586
I mean it's just
hard to believe.

19:10.586 --> 19:11.793
And from what
I can tell-

19:11.793 --> 19:12.793
behind the scenes-

19:12.793 --> 19:14.413
her Bungalow co-stars
seemed to liked her.

19:14.413 --> 19:17.379
I wonder who she was when
she wasn't playing a part?

19:17.379 --> 19:20.310
Well she wasn't as well-liked
by her co-stars in the theatre.

19:20.310 --> 19:21.206
Did Joy tell
you that?

19:21.206 --> 19:22.310
Yeah.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.724
But she has a one-woman
musical opening next month.

19:25.793 --> 19:27.862
Oh so she must have
been planning for months!

19:27.862 --> 19:28.724
Right.

19:28.724 --> 19:30.034
But I don't think
the conversation

19:30.034 --> 19:31.000
between Tegan
and Frecker

19:31.000 --> 19:32.379
was about her
taking over Joy's role.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.206
I mean Frecker
had to know

19:34.206 --> 19:36.000
that she wasn't planning
on touring with the show.

19:36.862 --> 19:37.862
Frecker's married, right?

19:37.862 --> 19:39.103
I think so.

19:39.103 --> 19:40.172
Yeah why?

19:40.172 --> 19:42.620
Well Lois told Charlie that
Tegan bewitched him

19:42.620 --> 19:43.724
into giving her
the lead role.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.275
She seems to think
that they were an item.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.689
Okay I will look into
Tegan's phone records

19:48.689 --> 19:50.517
for conversations with Frecker.

19:50.517 --> 19:52.896
See if they were closer
than producer-actor.

19:52.896 --> 19:53.620
Okay.

20:00.344 --> 20:02.758
One household
on the isle of the dead-

20:04.827 --> 20:07.241
One 'ouse'old on
the isle of the dead-

20:09.827 --> 20:12.137
One 'ouse'old on
the isle of the dead!

20:13.655 --> 20:15.379
Which one do
you prefer huh?

20:18.620 --> 20:20.241
You know, I can't rely
on you for anything.

20:23.137 --> 20:24.896
Am I interrupting something?

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Uh- no!

20:27.000 --> 20:29.413
I was just on
my lunch break.

20:29.413 --> 20:30.413
Oh right, sorry.

20:30.413 --> 20:31.655
Well look-

20:31.655 --> 20:33.655
Frecker's all over the news
urging people to buy tickets

20:33.655 --> 20:35.103
after the theatre's
terrible tragedy.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.655
I mean they're selling
like hotcakes.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.586
We didn't even given him
the okay to go ahead yet.

20:39.620 --> 20:41.034
Hey.

20:41.034 --> 20:42.448
Jesse, you pull anything
off Rex's collar mic?

20:42.448 --> 20:43.620
No not yet.

20:43.620 --> 20:44.724
But I did find something

20:44.724 --> 20:45.689
in Tegan's phone records.

20:45.689 --> 20:46.517
Calls with Frecker.

20:46.517 --> 20:47.206
Okay?

20:47.206 --> 20:47.931
Oodles of them.

20:47.931 --> 20:48.586
All hours.

20:48.586 --> 20:49.793
Long ones.

20:49.793 --> 20:51.034
That sounds like more than
a professional relationship.

20:51.034 --> 20:53.137
Well maybe the recording was
Tegan trying to convince Frecker

20:53.137 --> 20:54.172
to tell his wife
about her.

20:54.172 --> 20:55.758
Which he wouldn't want
to have wanted to do.

20:55.758 --> 20:57.620
And now he's capitalizing
off her death.

20:57.620 --> 20:58.793
Sounds like motive.

20:59.827 --> 21:00.931
Rex, come on!

21:05.793 --> 21:10.103
We're are fighting
through our grief.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.344
The show will be dedicated
to Tegan's memory.

21:13.344 --> 21:14.172
As you can imagine-

21:14.172 --> 21:16.103
the cast is
very shaken.

21:16.103 --> 21:16.862
Ah!

21:17.620 --> 21:19.724
Here's our latest
cast member!

21:19.724 --> 21:22.241
Rex will be
playing Hairy Man-

21:22.241 --> 21:23.310
who was the
heroic dog

21:23.310 --> 21:26.689
who helped pull victims
of the shipwreck to shore.

21:26.689 --> 21:28.310
Say hello, Rex!

21:30.827 --> 21:32.034
Rex is working.

21:32.034 --> 21:34.931
And you and I need to have
a word down at the station.

21:34.931 --> 21:35.862
What's this about?

21:37.448 --> 21:39.655
Your affair with
Tegan Mansfield.

21:39.655 --> 21:41.448
Please, shut off
the camera.

21:44.655 --> 21:46.137
Detective, you don't understand.

21:47.413 --> 21:49.068
We weren't
having an affair.

21:49.068 --> 21:50.379
Oh really?

21:51.448 --> 21:52.758
Tegan was my daughter.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.275
No, Sam.

22:04.275 --> 22:05.482
I'm done waiting.

22:05.482 --> 22:07.413
We've
talked about this.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.586
You need
to tell her.

22:08.586 --> 22:09.275
I will.

22:09.275 --> 22:11.517
Just not yet.

22:11.517 --> 22:12.586
You have to
give me time.

22:15.068 --> 22:17.206
That was you and Tegan,
three days before she died.

22:17.206 --> 22:19.172
What were you
talking about?

22:19.172 --> 22:22.206
Tegan was tired
of being a secret.

22:22.206 --> 22:24.655
She wanted people to know
that she was my daughter.

22:24.655 --> 22:28.620
But I just didn't know
how to break it to my wife.

22:28.620 --> 22:31.379
She didn't know
you'd had an affair?

22:31.379 --> 22:33.310
Gloria knew there
were dalliances.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.655
But a child?

22:35.655 --> 22:38.344
That's a whole
other thing.

22:38.344 --> 22:40.034
I just didn't
want to rush it.

22:40.034 --> 22:42.758
But Tegan was
pressuring you to.

22:44.620 --> 22:45.896
And that's why
you killed her.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.310
To keep her from
telling your wife herself.

22:47.310 --> 22:47.965
Kill her?

22:47.965 --> 22:49.448
No, I would never- !

22:51.862 --> 22:54.241
Tegan's death-

22:54.241 --> 22:55.965
it was an accident.

22:55.965 --> 22:57.793
An equipment malfunction.

22:59.482 --> 23:02.068
Our investigation says
that's not the case.

23:04.413 --> 23:06.275
I loved Tegan.

23:06.275 --> 23:09.758
I would never do
anything to hurt her.

23:09.758 --> 23:12.344
This last day has
been unbearable.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.551
Not so unbearable
that it kept you

23:15.551 --> 23:18.275
from doubling down on
promoting your show.

23:21.965 --> 23:26.620
Do you have any idea how tenuous
producing theatre can be?

23:26.620 --> 23:29.689
There was a real
chance that

23:29.689 --> 23:31.896
the tour would fall apart
after Tegan's death.

23:32.862 --> 23:36.896
I couldn't face losing both
my babies on the same day.

23:42.448 --> 23:44.655
Anyone in the company
have an issue with Tegan?

23:44.655 --> 23:45.793
Of course not.

23:45.793 --> 23:46.965
Everyone loved her.

23:46.965 --> 23:51.000
Somebody meant for that
rowboat to come crashing down.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.827
What about your wife?

23:52.827 --> 23:54.793
Is it possible she found
out about your secret

23:54.793 --> 23:57.758
and took matters
into her own hands?

24:00.379 --> 24:02.344
Absolutely not!

24:02.344 --> 24:03.655
Gloria's been
away all month.

24:04.896 --> 24:06.827
Plus she never steps
foot in the theatre.

24:06.827 --> 24:08.862
She's been on me
to sell it for years.

24:13.172 --> 24:15.551
If only I'd listened
and sold it

24:15.551 --> 24:17.689
when I had an
offer in the spring.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.586
Tegan would still
be alive today.

24:26.827 --> 24:28.793
One household on
the Isle of the dead-

24:28.793 --> 24:31.482
saved hundreds from
an ocean-grave bed.

24:31.482 --> 24:33.551
You in for
rehearsal again?

24:33.551 --> 24:34.620
Yeah.

24:34.620 --> 24:36.344
Yeah, just
a small one.

24:36.344 --> 24:37.862
Lois wants to make
a few adjustments

24:37.862 --> 24:39.931
now that we're
using a real dog!

24:40.586 --> 24:41.620
Oh!

24:42.413 --> 24:43.344
Hey.

24:45.620 --> 24:49.000
It's nice to
have a pup around.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.620
But he doesn't look
a thing like the dog

24:50.620 --> 24:52.413
from the actual story.

24:52.413 --> 24:53.137
What do you mean?

24:54.068 --> 24:55.724
A Newfoundland,
Hairy Man was.

24:55.724 --> 24:57.655
You don't know that-

24:57.655 --> 24:59.241
I'm guessing that means

24:59.241 --> 25:01.689
you don't know the real story
of First Mate Lancaster either.

25:01.689 --> 25:03.482
I just know what
the script tells me.

25:03.482 --> 25:05.310
Ughh.

25:05.310 --> 25:07.517
Well he wasn't a
pirate, for starters.

25:07.517 --> 25:09.965
And he didn't
cause the wreck.

25:09.965 --> 25:11.965
He tried to help
the passengers!

25:14.068 --> 25:15.724
Your pup alright?

25:15.724 --> 25:17.448
What is it, buddy?

25:17.724 --> 25:18.655
Rex?

25:27.310 --> 25:28.344
Oh no!

25:28.448 --> 25:29.241
Stay there buddy.

25:31.793 --> 25:32.413
Jeez.

25:32.413 --> 25:33.206
Hold on.

25:34.344 --> 25:37.206
Oh, give me
a second here.

25:39.034 --> 25:39.862
Okay.

25:40.517 --> 25:41.379
That's a
good job, Rex.

25:41.379 --> 25:43.586
We almost had a
fire on our hands.

25:43.586 --> 25:44.931
That's the second
time this month

25:44.931 --> 25:47.206
we've had problems
with our wiring.

25:47.206 --> 25:48.413
This doesn't look
like an accident.

25:48.413 --> 25:50.103
Looks like somebody
tampered with that.

25:50.103 --> 25:51.896
Where
the hell is Lois?

25:51.896 --> 25:53.103
And why is the
generator running?

25:53.103 --> 25:54.931
Well the fuse box
was just on fire.

25:54.931 --> 25:56.482
I think you guys need
to call an electrician.

25:56.482 --> 25:57.896
I'll take
care of it.

25:57.896 --> 25:58.724
Wait hold on.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.758
You said this was
the second time

25:59.758 --> 26:00.793
in two months?

26:00.793 --> 26:01.896
Have there been other
issues at the theatre?

26:01.896 --> 26:03.448
It's an old building.

26:03.448 --> 26:04.689
Things are always going.

26:04.689 --> 26:05.448
Like what?

26:05.448 --> 26:06.655
Flood last month.

26:06.655 --> 26:08.172
Damaged a ton
of costumes.

26:08.172 --> 26:09.206
Don't forget the
air conditioning

26:09.206 --> 26:11.448
up and dying in the
middle of a heat wave.

26:11.448 --> 26:14.103
It's almost as if someone
upset the theatre ghost.

26:14.103 --> 26:15.103
Yeah, something tells me

26:15.103 --> 26:16.965
a theatre ghost is not
responsible for this.

26:16.965 --> 26:18.931
We were supposed to go over
Frecker's new sound cues

26:18.931 --> 26:20.068
at 9:30.

26:20.068 --> 26:22.172
You know I do morning
pages between nine and ten.

26:22.172 --> 26:24.206
And if Frecker wants
more changes-

26:24.206 --> 26:25.862
he can discuss them
with you himself.

26:25.862 --> 26:27.517
Well I don't think
he can, actually.

26:27.517 --> 26:30.586
Last I saw, he was on his way
to be questioned by the police.

26:31.275 --> 26:33.034
Why's that?

26:33.034 --> 26:34.034
Is this about
Tegan's death?

26:34.034 --> 26:35.275
Has he been arrested?

26:35.275 --> 26:36.793
Frecker is not being
detained at this time.

26:38.482 --> 26:40.103
Then I'm sure
he'll be in soon-

26:40.103 --> 26:41.137
to discuss strobe lights-

26:41.137 --> 26:43.724
or whatever nonsense
he's cooked up this time.

26:43.724 --> 26:45.241
In the meantime,
we have work to do.

26:45.241 --> 26:46.413
Let's go.

26:48.103 --> 26:49.206
Come on buddy.

26:53.827 --> 26:56.448
The fuse box was
definitely tampered with.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.413
Well thank goodness
Rex was there.

26:58.413 --> 26:59.724
Yeah well
that's not all.

26:59.724 --> 27:01.655
Apparently there's been a
whole host of other issues

27:01.655 --> 27:02.517
at the theatre.

27:02.517 --> 27:03.448
Marly seems to think

27:03.448 --> 27:04.655
it has to do with
the building's age.

27:05.793 --> 27:06.793
You don't sound convinced.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.517
Well, given Tegan's death-

27:08.517 --> 27:10.655
Those problems
aren't accidents either.

27:10.758 --> 27:11.862
But who'd
have reason

27:11.862 --> 27:13.482
to tamper with equipment
at the theatre?

27:13.482 --> 27:16.068
Well Frecker was saying that
he wanted to sell the building

27:16.068 --> 27:17.034
before Tegan showed up.

27:17.034 --> 27:18.103
Maybe-

27:18.103 --> 27:19.310
the buyer wasn't happy
with his change of heart.

27:19.310 --> 27:20.862
So they tried
a few acts of vandalism

27:20.862 --> 27:23.655
in order to get
Frecker to reconsider.

27:23.655 --> 27:25.034
And when that
didn't do the trick-

27:25.034 --> 27:26.655
they upped the ante
and tampered with the fly?

27:26.655 --> 27:29.551
Tegan was the big
draw for the show.

27:29.551 --> 27:31.689
It would make sense that
somebody would think

27:31.689 --> 27:33.310
that killing her would
slow ticket sales.

27:33.310 --> 27:35.137
We need to figure out who
this potential buyer is.

27:35.137 --> 27:36.862
I might be able
to help with that.

27:42.827 --> 27:43.655
It looks like
the buildings

27:43.655 --> 27:44.689
on either side
of the theatre

27:44.689 --> 27:45.655
were sold six
months ago

27:45.655 --> 27:47.758
to a developer
named Theo Schwab.

27:50.517 --> 27:52.034
I recognize
that face.

27:52.034 --> 27:53.655
He was at the
dress rehearsal.

27:53.655 --> 27:54.758
That gives him opportunity.

27:54.758 --> 27:56.206
Jesse, can you get
me an address?

27:56.206 --> 27:56.862
Oh yeah.

27:56.862 --> 27:57.931
I can do you
one better.

27:57.931 --> 27:58.931
His cell phone
just pinged

27:58.931 --> 28:00.379
west of Quidi Vidi
lake in Pleasantville.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.068
Great.

28:02.172 --> 28:02.827
Rex.

28:25.310 --> 28:27.758
Ah, he looks like
he's up to no good.

28:27.758 --> 28:28.827
Let's check it out.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.931
Well that sure looks like
breaking and entering to me.

29:11.931 --> 29:13.068
You know
what to do pal.

29:23.758 --> 29:24.931
Ahhh!

29:26.689 --> 29:27.344
Aghh!

29:29.448 --> 29:30.379
Aghhh!

29:31.137 --> 29:32.275
That's enough pal.

29:37.241 --> 29:38.137
Theo Schwab?

29:40.620 --> 29:41.655
We need to
have a talk.

29:50.172 --> 29:52.620
Look, this is all a big misunderstanding.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.034
Oh so you weren't breaking
into private property?

29:55.034 --> 29:56.172
Sit down.

30:00.758 --> 30:03.275
Now what were
you planning to do

30:03.275 --> 30:05.068
with all of this?

30:05.068 --> 30:06.689
It's not what
you think.

30:06.689 --> 30:08.000
I'm a developer.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.724
Tundra Properties?

30:08.724 --> 30:10.379
I'm sure you've
heard of us.

30:11.275 --> 30:12.000
Here.

30:14.206 --> 30:15.103
No?

30:15.103 --> 30:17.482
Well, I'm in talks
to buy the building.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.275
I was inspecting the
condition of the property.

30:19.275 --> 30:20.586
Were you inspecting
the condition

30:20.586 --> 30:22.068
of the Calvert
Theatre as well?

30:23.103 --> 30:24.413
No idea what you're
talking about.

30:24.413 --> 30:26.344
Oh you were planning
to buy that too.

30:26.344 --> 30:27.482
But Sam Frecker-

30:27.482 --> 30:29.206
he changed his mind.

30:29.931 --> 30:31.310
Not the end
of the world.

30:31.310 --> 30:33.310
There's lots of other
properties out there.

30:33.862 --> 30:34.689
Yeah.

30:34.689 --> 30:36.655
But that's the only
one keeping you

30:36.655 --> 30:39.241
from building an entertainment
complex on that block.

30:39.241 --> 30:41.931
Coincidentally, they've been
having a few issues lately.

30:41.931 --> 30:42.689
There was a flood.

30:43.241 --> 30:44.620
Somebody was-

30:44.620 --> 30:46.068
tampering with the wiring.

30:49.103 --> 30:50.137
Look.

30:51.344 --> 30:53.000
We have your fingerprints
on the fuse box.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.241
You're on
the hook here.

30:57.275 --> 30:58.413
Okay.

30:58.413 --> 31:01.758
Maybe I did a little futzing
to give Frecker a nudge.

31:01.758 --> 31:03.310
I thought if bills
started piling up-

31:03.310 --> 31:05.068
maybe he'd be
persuaded to sell.

31:05.068 --> 31:06.310
Mmm.

31:07.206 --> 31:08.965
But when he
wasn't persuaded-

31:08.965 --> 31:11.034
you decided to go
after Tegan Mansfield?

31:12.931 --> 31:13.793
What are you
talking about?

31:13.793 --> 31:14.655
That was an
accident, right?

31:14.655 --> 31:15.793
No no no.

31:15.793 --> 31:17.172
That was murder.

31:17.172 --> 31:20.482
See, somebody tampered
with the fly system.

31:20.482 --> 31:21.655
Wait and you think-?

31:22.034 --> 31:22.931
It wasn't me!

31:22.931 --> 31:24.241
I don't even know
what a fly system is!

31:24.241 --> 31:25.620
You were at the
theatre that night.

31:25.620 --> 31:26.724
Along with thirty
other people!

31:26.724 --> 31:28.275
You had reason to
want the show to fail.

31:28.275 --> 31:29.586
I could care less
about the show!

31:29.586 --> 31:30.655
It's the
building I want!

31:30.655 --> 31:32.793
Look.

31:32.793 --> 31:34.827
I messed with the
fuses, I admit it.

31:34.827 --> 31:36.827
But I did not
hurt that girl.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.068
Aghhhh!

31:44.068 --> 31:45.344
Bark all ye want!

31:45.344 --> 31:49.827
Not one passenger is getting in
to shore until I get me gold!

31:52.413 --> 31:54.689
Remind me not to
get on his bad side.

31:54.689 --> 31:56.172
Joe or Rex?

31:56.172 --> 31:57.586
Oh both, for sure.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.620
Hey take
it easy pal.

32:00.689 --> 32:03.827
Hey what did Theo
Schwab have to say?

32:03.827 --> 32:06.379
He copped to
the vandalism.

32:06.379 --> 32:08.517
But he claims he doesn't
even know what a fly is.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.793
Do you believe him?

32:10.793 --> 32:11.448
Well, I mean-

32:11.448 --> 32:12.275
he's slippery.

32:12.275 --> 32:13.482
But I don't think
he's a killer.

32:13.482 --> 32:15.137
Besides, he cares
about the building.

32:15.137 --> 32:16.586
He's not interested
in the show.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.827
Yeah I wish more people
had that attitude.

32:18.827 --> 32:20.689
Uh, what do
you mean?

32:27.931 --> 32:30.448
This year's
Despatch is a wreck.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.206
If you thought drowning
at sea was bad-

32:32.206 --> 32:34.034
wait until you
see this show.

32:34.034 --> 32:35.241
Oh, Joe.

32:35.241 --> 32:36.206
I'm sure-

32:36.206 --> 32:38.137
they don't mean
your performance.

32:38.137 --> 32:39.103
There are
comments like this

32:39.103 --> 32:41.103
on every single article
about the show.

32:41.103 --> 32:43.137
I'd throw myself overboard
if I were this cheesy pirate

32:43.137 --> 32:45.689
they've added to this
revisionist history.

32:46.689 --> 32:48.000
So insensitive.

32:49.862 --> 32:51.068
The show is not
even open yet.

32:51.068 --> 32:52.896
How can so many people
have an opinion on it?

32:52.896 --> 32:54.448
Well they're
sock puppets.

32:54.551 --> 32:55.172
Sorry?

32:55.172 --> 32:56.275
Yeah yeah.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.448
They're fake online personas
create by a single user

32:58.448 --> 33:01.241
to influence public opinion.

33:01.241 --> 33:02.551
So someone with
an axe to grind.

33:02.551 --> 33:05.517
Maybe the same someone
who tampered with the fly?

33:05.517 --> 33:06.344
The question is who.

33:06.344 --> 33:07.448
You know, a
handful of these

33:07.448 --> 33:08.793
were posted this morning

33:08.793 --> 33:09.862
before 10:00 am

33:09.862 --> 33:11.620
from an IP address
belonging to Dunne's Donuts.

33:11.620 --> 33:13.000
I'll see if I can
get the CCTV.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.206
No there's
no need Jesse.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.896
I think I know
who posted them.

33:20.862 --> 33:23.034
Miss Labonte
won't like this.

33:23.034 --> 33:24.448
Well if she has
an issue with it-

33:24.448 --> 33:26.482
she can take it up with
Superintendant Donovan.

33:30.758 --> 33:31.827
Come on pal.

33:33.620 --> 33:34.482
Okay Rex.

33:56.620 --> 33:57.344
Yeah?

34:05.172 --> 34:06.000
Sarah.

34:06.103 --> 34:07.241
The missing counterweights.

34:07.241 --> 34:09.068
This doesn't
make any sense.

34:09.068 --> 34:09.931
Why would Lois

34:09.931 --> 34:10.827
try and sabotage
the show?

34:10.827 --> 34:12.172
She's been directing
it for years.

34:12.172 --> 34:14.172
Well maybe it has
something to do with this.

34:14.172 --> 34:15.965
The Seagull.

34:17.482 --> 34:19.000
It's full of notes.

34:21.137 --> 34:24.068
A rehearsal schedule,
proposed set designs.

34:26.724 --> 34:30.758
Yeah, according to this
rehearsal schedule-

34:30.758 --> 34:33.551
this show is supposed
to be playing right now.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.000
Excuse me.

34:40.620 --> 34:41.551
Excuse me.

34:42.206 --> 34:43.620
Do you know
anything about this?

34:43.620 --> 34:44.310
Ugh.

34:44.310 --> 34:46.000
It's a right shame.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.758
Miss Labonte had been waiting
years to direct that show.

34:48.758 --> 34:50.620
And what happened?

34:50.620 --> 34:51.655
Frecker cancelled it.

34:51.655 --> 34:54.965
Said the Despatch needed
extra rehearsal time-

34:54.965 --> 34:56.275
because of the tour.

34:59.655 --> 35:02.034
You're not hitting your
mark for your monologues.

35:02.034 --> 35:03.758
If you don't hit your
mark, I can't see you.

35:03.758 --> 35:04.655
Okay?

35:04.655 --> 35:06.482
Uh, yeah.

35:06.482 --> 35:08.689
You're not grounded in
the penultimate scene.

35:08.689 --> 35:11.724
So why don't you try
rocks in your shoes again?

35:11.724 --> 35:12.758
Okay?

35:12.758 --> 35:13.827
Take the air
out of it.

35:13.827 --> 35:14.862
Just take it out.

35:14.862 --> 35:15.965
Everyone please.

35:15.965 --> 35:17.517
Pick up your cues!

35:18.241 --> 35:19.241
No!

35:19.241 --> 35:20.724
No no no, we don't
need you today!

35:20.724 --> 35:21.655
We're working
with the puppet!

35:23.896 --> 35:25.551
You're work's done
for the day, Lois.

35:26.172 --> 35:27.551
And why is that?

35:27.551 --> 35:29.724
You're under arrest for the
murder of Tegan Mansfield.

35:41.344 --> 35:42.862
Frecker has been
calling non-stop

35:42.862 --> 35:45.206
to see if the show can
still open as planned.

35:45.206 --> 35:47.000
Hey, where are
we at with Lois?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.896
She admits to writing
the negative comments-

35:48.896 --> 35:51.034
but swears she had
nothing to do with the fly.

35:51.034 --> 35:52.413
Claims that somebody
must've planted the weights

35:52.413 --> 35:53.103
in her office.

35:53.103 --> 35:53.827
But she had motive.

35:54.724 --> 35:56.310
Her cancelled
Seagull show.

35:56.310 --> 35:57.655
And it was obvious

35:57.655 --> 35:58.517
she didn't like Tegan.

35:58.517 --> 35:59.827
Was there a window

35:59.827 --> 36:01.068
where she could've removed the
counterweights from the arbour?

36:01.068 --> 36:03.482
Yeah, cell phone records put
her at the theatre for an hour

36:03.482 --> 36:05.551
the day of the accident when
she was the only one there-

36:05.551 --> 36:06.724
according to the
security logs.

36:06.724 --> 36:10.482
And listen to what I picked
up from Rex's collar mic.

36:10.482 --> 36:13.448
No, this has got to be
the end of the Despatch.

36:13.448 --> 36:16.241
Between Tegan and
those comments I posted-

36:16.241 --> 36:18.310
there's no way the
show can continue.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.586
So hopefully we can start
rehearsing as soon as next week.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.551
Taken together
it's pretty damning.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.275
I don't know.

36:26.275 --> 36:27.310
I wish I had
a confession.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.448
But under the circumstances-

36:29.448 --> 36:31.103
I'm comfortable with
letting the show go on.

36:31.103 --> 36:31.965
Oh yes!

36:33.620 --> 36:35.793
What- I'm excited to
see Joe in his big scene.

36:37.758 --> 36:38.896
Yeah you too, Rex.

36:38.896 --> 36:39.551
You too.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.103
Could I have everyone's
attention please?

36:44.344 --> 36:46.103
Uh-

36:46.103 --> 36:47.689
I know it's been
a hard few days.

36:47.689 --> 36:51.896
And I appreciate
all your perseverance.

36:51.896 --> 36:55.482
Tegan wasn't just
a company member.

36:56.172 --> 36:57.172
She-

36:59.000 --> 37:00.551
she was my daughter.

37:02.517 --> 37:04.000
Didn't see that
one coming.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.379
Tegan would want
the tour to go on.

37:08.379 --> 37:09.172
And so it will-

37:09.172 --> 37:10.551
with our wonderful
Joy Jamieson

37:10.551 --> 37:11.724
continuing
on in the role-

37:11.724 --> 37:12.965
she originated.

37:12.965 --> 37:14.241
Yes, Joy.

37:14.241 --> 37:16.862
We dedicate
tonight to Tegan-

37:16.862 --> 37:22.137
and to the Newfoundlanders whose
lives we honour with our show.

37:22.137 --> 37:25.551
I want to pay special
tribute to the descendants

37:25.551 --> 37:28.241
of this tragedy who
work alongside us.

37:28.241 --> 37:28.965
Aislinn.

37:28.965 --> 37:31.620
Billy.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.137
Justina.

37:33.137 --> 37:34.172
And of course, Sean-

37:34.172 --> 37:36.862
whose great-great-
great grandfather

37:36.862 --> 37:39.482
will be played tonight by
Superintendent Joe Donovan.

37:44.655 --> 37:46.034
All right everyone.

37:46.034 --> 37:48.034
This is your
fifteen minute call.

37:48.034 --> 37:50.000
Fifteen minutes till showtime!

37:59.517 --> 38:02.034
Uh, here we
go again.

38:07.413 --> 38:08.413
Cue light four.

38:09.689 --> 38:10.448
Go.

38:18.793 --> 38:19.965
Cue Donovan.

38:19.965 --> 38:20.896
Go.

38:20.896 --> 38:26.413
Deep in the heart
of this terrible gale-

38:26.413 --> 38:31.413
let dread pirate
Lancaster tell ya a tale.

38:31.413 --> 38:35.068
For never a more epic
tale will you catch

38:35.068 --> 38:39.413
than this of the
shipwreck of The Despatch!

38:43.310 --> 38:46.896
One household on
the Isle of the Dead

38:46.896 --> 38:50.068
saved a hundred lives
from an ocean grave-bed.

38:51.758 --> 38:52.931
Anne!

38:55.931 --> 38:56.655
What's going on?

38:56.655 --> 38:57.931
They can't find Joy!

38:57.931 --> 38:58.586
Cue Joy!

38:58.586 --> 38:59.275
Go!

39:06.413 --> 39:08.206
Anne Harvey!

39:09.413 --> 39:11.689
She was only
seventeen years old!

39:22.689 --> 39:23.862
Fire!

39:29.689 --> 39:31.379
Everybody stay calm!

39:31.379 --> 39:33.000
Stay in your seats while
we contain the fire!

39:47.689 --> 39:48.965
Joy, can you
hear me?

39:51.724 --> 39:52.379
What happened?

39:52.379 --> 39:53.275
Who did
this to you?

39:53.275 --> 39:55.413
I was checking my
props in the cabin.

39:55.413 --> 39:56.344
He was there.

39:56.344 --> 39:57.137
Who?

39:57.137 --> 39:58.034
Who was there?

39:58.034 --> 39:58.689
He said-

39:58.689 --> 39:59.793
we have to stop
the show.

39:59.793 --> 40:02.793
That we're not telling
the real story anymore.

40:02.793 --> 40:03.620
The real story-

40:03.620 --> 40:04.448
what are you
talking about?

40:04.448 --> 40:06.137
Wait wait.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.793
Whoever did this was motivated
by the changes in the show.

40:08.793 --> 40:10.000
It wasn't Lois.

40:11.241 --> 40:11.931
Sean.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.413
The maintenance guy.

40:13.413 --> 40:14.586
Why would Sean do
something like this?

40:14.586 --> 40:15.724
Jesse said-

40:15.724 --> 40:17.931
Frecker changed his ancestor
from victim to villain.

40:17.931 --> 40:19.275
The pirate captain.

40:19.275 --> 40:21.000
He was furious.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.206
Easy there pup.

40:45.275 --> 40:47.241
Nice pup.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.655
Ah ah ah!

40:59.655 --> 41:01.034
Looks like the
jig is up Sean.

41:03.206 --> 41:04.379
Good boy.

41:09.172 --> 41:11.482
I didn't want
to kill Tegan.

41:11.482 --> 41:13.931
I just needed Frecker
to cancel the tour!

41:14.655 --> 41:16.689
I couldn't let the country
think that this was

41:16.689 --> 41:17.379
the real story!

41:17.379 --> 41:18.586
Okay, that's enough Sean.

41:18.586 --> 41:19.931
Let's go.

41:19.931 --> 41:22.655
He turned my great-
great-great grandfather

41:22.655 --> 41:24.758
from a hero
to a pirate!

41:24.758 --> 41:27.413
A man who killed
his brother!

41:27.413 --> 41:29.275
He made a mockery

41:29.275 --> 41:30.206
of our history!

41:30.206 --> 41:31.413
And you let him!

41:31.413 --> 41:33.310
Liars!

41:33.310 --> 41:34.000
Vultures!

41:34.000 --> 41:34.689
All of you!

41:35.689 --> 41:38.413
Who gave you the right
to change our story?

41:40.068 --> 41:40.724
Take him.

41:40.724 --> 41:41.827
Come on.

42:07.310 --> 42:08.241
Hey.

42:18.931 --> 42:20.931
You know, I thought
updating the Despatch

42:20.931 --> 42:22.310
was going to
make Tegan a star.

42:22.310 --> 42:24.310
But all it did
was get her killed.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.482
And now Joy.

42:27.689 --> 42:28.344
How is she?

42:28.344 --> 42:29.793
She's going
to be fine.

42:29.793 --> 42:31.344
She's going to be released
from the hospital tomorrow.

42:31.344 --> 42:33.344
Thank goodness.

42:33.448 --> 42:34.965
Will the tour
still go on?

42:34.965 --> 42:38.758
If it does, there's not
going to be any pirates.

42:38.758 --> 42:40.931
I've learned my lesson.

42:40.931 --> 42:42.379
Truth makes
the best story.

42:44.482 --> 42:45.413
As a long time fan-

42:45.413 --> 42:46.827
I'm very happy
to hear that.

42:46.827 --> 42:48.620
Well we'll be first
in line to buy tickets.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.344
Well there won't be
any need for tickets.

42:50.344 --> 42:51.379
I want you
two on stage-

42:51.379 --> 42:52.241
opening night!

42:53.827 --> 42:54.724
What do you
say, Rex?

42:56.275 --> 42:59.344
I think Rex and I have
had enough of the spotlight

42:59.344 --> 43:00.448
for the time being.

43:03.000 --> 43:03.689
Isn't that right pal?

43:05.344 --> 43:06.655
Ah.
