02:17.537 --> 02:18.670
- What's the matter?

02:20.440 --> 02:21.540
What's the matter?

02:23.343 --> 02:24.443
- Bulb must be out.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.588
- Do you have me?
- Always.

02:39.726 --> 02:42.461
- Can you see anything?
- Yes. Remember the stairs?

02:43.396 --> 02:45.931
- No. I don't remember
anything about this house,

02:46.733 --> 02:48.167
except that I don't like it.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.903
- What are you talking about?
This is a great place.

02:51.571 --> 02:54.206
- No, it's cold,
and it's so dark.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.448
- You'll light it up, princess.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.511
- Yeah, right, especially now.
- Don't say that.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.649
- Look, I'm bearing
the burden here.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.284
All right?

03:05.286 --> 03:06.451
This is all my fault.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.586
Everything's my fault.

03:08.354 --> 03:10.822
I just wanna disappear.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.825
- I can't leave
everything I've built.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.394
We'll stay here.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.495
We'll figure it out.

03:16.729 --> 03:18.230
Come on.

03:34.314 --> 03:35.747
- Get ready for bed.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.882
You'll feel better.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.818
- I doubt that.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.553
- Helen,
what you have is temporary.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.959
- You keep saying that.
- Everything will pass.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.360
The feelings will pass too.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.628
I know they will.

03:49.630 --> 03:53.398
And the past will become
more distant until one day...

03:53.400 --> 03:54.833
- I'll never
forget what happened.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.902
- You will.
- I won't.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.404
- Some day, you'll see.

04:01.274 --> 04:02.874
You'll realize that
it wasn't your fault.

04:08.815 --> 04:09.915
Take these.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.683
Help you sleep.

06:07.433 --> 06:08.934
- Princess...
- Mm.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.769
- I'm leaving.
- Mm?

06:11.738 --> 06:15.006
- I have to go to work.
- Mm? Where are you going?

06:15.008 --> 06:16.708
- I won't be late.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.777
- No. No, I can't be alone.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.612
- You won't be alone.
Rosa will be here.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.148
- No. Who?
- My old housekeeper.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.850
I called her.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.585
She'll stay with you,
take care of things.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.867
- Oh, no. I want you.
I want you.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.721
- Mm.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.790
- Don't go.
- Rosa will be here.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.625
Anything you need.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.592
- Hey, stranger.

07:12.532 --> 07:13.632
- Morning, Leela.

07:14.834 --> 07:16.802
- When did you get in?
- Last night.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.807
- Are you staying
or just checking the place?

07:21.809 --> 07:23.842
- Probably be here for a while.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.211
- Good.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.580
Why don't you stop in later?

07:31.784 --> 07:32.884
- I gotta get to work.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.720
- 'Kay.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.558
Oh! Bye.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.884
- Buenos dias, señora.

08:09.021 --> 08:12.190
- Have you seen my scarf?
- I'll find it, señora.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.261
- So, have you ever taken care
of anyone like me before?

08:17.763 --> 08:19.898
I mean, this is temporary

08:19.900 --> 08:21.233
but...

08:21.235 --> 08:23.034
- I take care of lots
of people, señora.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.269
I clean.
I cook.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.005
- Great.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.977
- Señora, Mila, my cousin,
he got runned over by a tractor.

08:33.044 --> 08:35.547
Both the legs
caught off, no good.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.616
And I take care of him.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.619
- Wonderful.

08:41.621 --> 08:42.754
- He's good now, señora.

08:43.688 --> 08:44.723
Mila, he find better work

08:45.825 --> 08:47.826
with no legs
than when he was complete.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.596
He find a job in computadoras

08:51.598 --> 08:52.598
in big company.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.666
No problem.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.767
No problem, señora.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.705
- I get it.
It's okay.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.607
It's okay.
Señora, it's okay.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.042
I clean it.
I clean it, señora.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.277
I clean it.
It's not broken.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.547
It's no broken, señora.

09:09.582 --> 09:10.982
Señora, it's okay.

09:12.251 --> 09:13.552
It's okay, señora.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.587
You'll be okay, señora.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.124
It's okay, señora.

09:20.993 --> 09:22.327
- Breathe.

09:27.867 --> 09:28.967
And again.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.273
And one more time.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.713
Her vitals are fine, Arthur.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.148
- Psychosomatic?

09:43.150 --> 09:44.310
- Well, the symptoms are real

09:48.788 --> 09:51.022
but she is responding
to some stimulation,

09:51.924 --> 09:53.592
which is a good sign.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.893
- She told me
she could see some shapes

09:54.895 --> 09:56.127
on occasion, some light.

09:57.029 --> 09:59.097
But nothing clear.
- I'm sitting right here.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.034
- You're acting
like I'm not sitting here.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.003
- I'm just trying
to explain the situation.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.339
Derrell was kind enough to come
over, given the circumstances.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.907
- But I can answer
my own questions.

10:09.642 --> 10:10.976
- Then please tell him.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.780
- Things are dark
and hazy and unfocused.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.382
I don't know.
It fluctuates.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.918
- The prognosis isn't clear.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.121
You may see again,
and you may not.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.823
It's hard to say.

10:24.825 --> 10:27.392
- I can't see a goddamn thing.
All right?

10:27.394 --> 10:30.028
Won't you just tell me
what this thing is, please?

10:30.863 --> 10:32.163
- Helen, you are...

10:32.932 --> 10:36.167
Although clinically your vision
is considered low,

10:36.802 --> 10:38.703
your exam results
are inconclusive.

10:39.171 --> 10:41.172
Right now, with your vision
acuity as it is,

10:41.174 --> 10:43.675
you're considered legally blind.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.012
Now, I understand that
it's hard to live with,

10:47.014 --> 10:48.413
but you just need to accept it
and move on.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.248
It's not the end of the world.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.450
There are some great programs
for the visually impaired.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.854
- Rosa!
- Helen, calm down.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.156
Do not... You told me
this thing was gonna pass,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.191
and now you're saying
that it's gonna last forever?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.093
- What happened?
- Princess, you...

11:02.095 --> 11:03.395
- Don't princess me.

11:03.397 --> 11:04.729
Get me out of here, Rosa.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.801
- Si, señora.
- I didn't mean to be harsh,

11:09.803 --> 11:11.136
but right now you'll just
have to live

11:11.138 --> 11:13.071
as though you'll never
see again.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.205
- Shut up, okay?

11:14.974 --> 11:16.174
Do you hear me?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.109
All of you doctors are the same.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.744
You say you know everything.

11:19.746 --> 11:21.186
But when it counts,
you know nothing.

11:25.685 --> 11:30.422
- There's a step
in front of you.

11:33.959 --> 11:34.993
Good.
- I'm sorry, Derrell.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.829
Sometimes she just
acts like a child.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.830
- It's to be expected.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.952
She's had a hard time of it.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.000
We only do what we know.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.369
Listen, call me
if you need anything, Arthur.

12:07.326 --> 12:08.426
- It's okay, señora.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.928
It's okay.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.090
You're gonna be okay, señora.

12:12.331 --> 12:13.465
It's okay.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.931
- Come on! Come on!

12:49.368 --> 12:50.535
- Hold on.
I'm right there.

12:53.873 --> 12:54.906
Okay.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.457
- No!

14:20.259 --> 14:21.259
- It's okay, señora.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.094
Portfolio favor, señora.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.429
Please don't move.
Don't move, señora, por favor.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.898
- I'm blind! I'm fucking blind.
- It's okay, senora.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.167
- I help you, señora,
put some more.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.401
- I'm worthless.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.537
I can't even do my makeup.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.139
- No. No, I call a doctor.
I call a doctor.

14:35.141 --> 14:37.575
- What can they do?
What... what can he do?

14:39.979 --> 14:41.246
- Oh, señora.
It's okay.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.414
It's okay.

14:44.516 --> 14:45.650
- I don't know what to do.

14:48.587 --> 14:52.123
- I'm being punished.
- I messed up really bad.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.259
I really was stupid.

14:55.294 --> 14:56.628
I was.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.297
- Well, I wouldn't be
too worried about it.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.899
I'll come back any minute.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.234
So, look, if you'd
change for me, okay?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.236
- All right.
- Thanks.

15:10.309 --> 15:11.442
Yes?

15:13.078 --> 15:14.512
All right.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.980
No, it's okay.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.586
I will be home as soon as I can.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.994
Okay. Let's see
what we have here.

15:40.406 --> 15:41.506
There she is.

15:49.148 --> 15:51.015
- I'm blind, Arthur.
Is this some kind of joke?

15:51.017 --> 15:52.617
- Oh, come on.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.153
We'll have a nice dinner, relax.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.556
Nothing's changed for me, Helen.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.692
You're still
my beautiful wife, you know?

16:03.228 --> 16:04.348
Can I tell you how you look?

16:08.634 --> 16:10.401
You have gorgeous shoulders,

16:13.305 --> 16:16.975
a long graceful neck

16:18.277 --> 16:19.377
like a swan.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.515
- Will you put one in my hair?

16:57.549 --> 16:58.683
- You win.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.618
I'll get ready.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.719
- Can't wait.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.528
- Honey, did you see my scarf?
- No.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.030
Last I saw it, it was on the end

17:21.507 --> 17:22.607
table.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.288
- Arthur?

18:13.759 --> 18:14.859
Is that you?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.564
Arthur?

18:21.166 --> 18:22.166
Is that you?

18:22.168 --> 18:23.334
- Not quite ready!

18:29.274 --> 18:30.674
- I think
there's something up here!

18:38.450 --> 18:40.218
- Don't come down.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.220
I'm almost finished.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.115
- Damn it, Arthur!
There's something up here!

18:46.158 --> 18:47.391
- One more minute.

18:57.603 --> 18:58.903
What are you doing?

18:58.905 --> 19:02.673
- There's something in the
wall. I just heard something.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.208
- What are you talking about?

19:04.210 --> 19:07.879
- I just heard something in...
- I didn't hear anything.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.681
- I could've sworn I did.
- It's probably the wind.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.484
Come on. I made us a feast.

19:17.523 --> 19:18.656
You look wonderful.

19:19.925 --> 19:23.494
- I did my best.
- You're perfect.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.396
Come on.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.429
It's your favorite.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.864
Have as much
as you want, princess.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.439
There's plenty.

20:29.328 --> 20:30.608
You're just so beautiful, honey.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.763
Here's something else,

20:35.534 --> 20:37.301
something you want.

20:43.542 --> 20:45.509
- What is this?
- Oh, a little something.

20:46.845 --> 20:47.979
- What is it?

20:55.387 --> 20:57.521
- It's an outfit for bed.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.328
- Is this for me or for you?

21:05.464 --> 21:06.744
- It's from your favorite store.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.703
- What does it look like?

21:13.438 --> 21:16.841
- Oh, it's pink and...

21:18.710 --> 21:21.012
- It's silky, huh?
- It's very nice.

21:22.514 --> 21:23.614
Try it on.

21:25.584 --> 21:26.684
- Okay.

21:50.375 --> 21:51.542
- Still too soon?

22:01.586 --> 22:03.020
- I just need a little bit
more time.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.555
- I know.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.560
- I love you.
- Me too.

24:05.877 --> 24:08.846
- Is Athur here?
- Un momento, por favor.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.983
Señora, it's a señora here,

24:12.985 --> 24:14.084
a visitor.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.054
- It's just me, my dear.

24:19.991 --> 24:23.727
Well, I was not expecting
to see this.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.530
- What?
- I came to see Arthur.

24:26.532 --> 24:28.032
Who are you?

24:28.034 --> 24:30.601
- Excuse me.
- I am Leela.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.869
I live next door.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.704
Didn't Arthur tell you about me?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.073
- Um, no.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.035
And apparently he didn't
tell you about me either.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.578
Must have forgotten
we were married.

24:41.513 --> 24:42.613
I'm Helen.

24:44.716 --> 24:48.486
- Oh, well,
you know how men are.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.821
They're all pigs when it comes
to thinks like that.

24:51.523 --> 24:54.225
You know, that's why us women
have to stick together.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.495
- Sure.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.597
- You seem upset, darling.

24:59.599 --> 25:00.731
How's your day going?

25:03.835 --> 25:05.169
- My day?

25:06.204 --> 25:07.671
Well, besides being blind

25:08.607 --> 25:12.576
and tripping
over everything, really good.

25:19.150 --> 25:20.684
I don't know.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.586
I just wanna know
if I'm ever gonna see again.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.157
- I don't know
how you feel about this.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.294
I know we just met,

25:30.996 --> 25:32.730
but I can read the cards.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.633
- Cards?
- Yes.

25:36.768 --> 25:38.168
- What, do you mean
like tarot cards?

25:38.170 --> 25:42.139
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

25:43.241 --> 25:44.575
- I'll go get them.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.556
Cut.

26:11.336 --> 26:14.738
Hmm. Interesting.

26:14.740 --> 26:19.910
- According to the cards,
you will see again, my darling.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.246
- I will?
Well, when?

26:22.248 --> 26:24.214
When does it say?
Look at me, Leela.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.616
I can't keep living like this.

26:25.618 --> 26:28.786
- That I can't tell, because
the cards never tell time.

26:30.188 --> 26:31.322
- Well, this is a waste.

26:32.123 --> 26:33.657
- No, it's not.

26:34.125 --> 26:38.896
Because here says that you need
to accept your moment,

26:38.898 --> 26:40.664
learn your surroundings.

26:41.299 --> 26:42.633
- Well, no kidding.

26:43.835 --> 26:46.971
- Ooh, I gotta go.
- No. I'm sorry.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.372
Please don't.
Please stay.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.240
I'll make you a cup
of tea or something.

26:50.242 --> 26:51.709
- I'd love to, darling,

26:53.211 --> 26:55.713
but the energy here's really
getting heavy.

26:55.715 --> 26:56.715
- It is bad, isn't it?

26:59.184 --> 27:00.284
- It's almost like...

27:02.153 --> 27:04.254
I don't know.
It's a dark presence.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.325
This place has been in
my husband's family for years,

27:08.327 --> 27:10.728
but I had to go somewhere.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.050
I had to get
away from everything.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.332
- It's not it.
I'm reading something else.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.203
It's a spirit of a child.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.038
Does that make any sense to you?

27:27.345 --> 27:31.315
- It was a little girl,
and she died.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.650
And it was my fault.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.120
- Still not it.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.223
This is a spirit
of an unborn child.

27:42.761 --> 27:43.861
Did you have an abortion?

27:55.840 --> 27:59.677
- I can't have kids.
- Oh, sweetie.

27:59.679 --> 28:00.744
It's gonna be okay.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.148
You'll see better than before.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.683
I know it.

28:06.151 --> 28:10.220
Until then, you need to live
like if you won't.

28:11.756 --> 28:12.856
Okay?

28:12.858 --> 28:13.924
It will only benefit you.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.401
You'll be fine.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.276
- Good, señora.
- Ah, si,.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.477
Yes, yes.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.112
That's what therapy
tells you to do:

28:35.114 --> 28:36.146
mark the room.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.448
Okay.
Walk.

28:37.450 --> 28:41.218
One, two, three.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.253
Abre. Open, open.

28:44.089 --> 28:46.256
Open. Close it.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.859
Close it.
There you go.

28:48.861 --> 28:49.893
Okay. We're gonna do it again.

28:49.895 --> 28:50.994
Turn around, turn around.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.263
Good.
One.

28:53.265 --> 28:59.002
Two, three, four, five.

29:03.341 --> 29:04.975
Open.

29:04.977 --> 29:06.410
Keep closed.

29:08.379 --> 29:11.381
- New document.
- New document opened.

29:12.784 --> 29:14.218
- My name is Helen.

29:15.186 --> 29:16.520
- My name is Helen.

29:18.823 --> 29:21.859
- Save document.
- Document saved.

29:24.796 --> 29:28.165
- Close document.
- Document closed.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.057
- Four, five!

29:54.893 --> 29:56.293
Touch.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.394
One, two.

30:08.973 --> 30:10.274
Step slowly.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.413
Remember if they big.

30:18.516 --> 30:20.918
Uno, dos,

30:22.954 --> 30:26.323
tres, cuatro.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.560
Feel the grass.
Feel the grass. Okay.

30:29.562 --> 30:32.095
Now, they're complete.
That's it.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.364
That's it. No more.
No, no, no.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.334
Stand, stand, stand.
Go to the concrete.

30:37.336 --> 30:42.072
Then down.
Then down.

30:42.074 --> 30:43.207
Then down, then down.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.075
Feel the water.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.176
Feel the agua, the agua.

30:48.546 --> 30:49.847
Stand.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.415
- Rosa, can you get that?

31:53.278 --> 31:55.612
- Oh, darling!
- Leela.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.694
I was just listening to that CD
that you made for me.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.583
- Have you seen Lovey?

31:59.585 --> 32:01.652
I can't find her anywhere.

32:01.654 --> 32:03.186
She's such a bad dog!

32:04.155 --> 32:05.222
- I haven't seen Lovey.

32:05.224 --> 32:08.058
But then again, I don't see
much of anything these days.

32:08.559 --> 32:10.494
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.628
It's a figure of speech.

32:12.563 --> 32:14.064
But, um, I haven't heard
from her either.

32:14.066 --> 32:18.368
- Uh, she's the only thing
in my life I can count on.

32:18.370 --> 32:21.071
You know, I mean,
I go on dates, believe me.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.974
The latest, well,
what a piece of work.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.709
Take you to Paris
on one weekend.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.211
And on the other one,
he stands me up for dinner.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.548
Really? Who am I
to take such behavior?

32:33.418 --> 32:35.285
I think he's seeing
someone else too.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.322
I mean, it's not
like I ask him to be exclusive.

32:38.324 --> 32:41.158
It's just, he should be honest.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.160
None of them are.

32:44.395 --> 32:47.631
They all have their little
deep, dark secrets.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.467
Is Arthur like that too?

32:51.502 --> 32:52.636
- I hope not.

32:54.205 --> 32:56.039
- Well, I carry on too much.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.307
If you see Lovey,
please be a dear

32:57.309 --> 32:58.375
and let me know.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.743
- Yeah, of course.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.212
- The little devil,
worrying me to pieces!

33:02.680 --> 33:04.120
- Don't worry.
She's gonna come back.

33:10.355 --> 33:11.488
- Are you okay, darling?

33:14.559 --> 33:15.993
If you see Lovey, call me.

33:18.296 --> 33:22.065
You remember, just
press the nine.

33:25.069 --> 33:26.103
Okay, I gotta go.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.323
- Six twenty-three p.m.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.229
Six twenty-four p.m.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.300
The time is...

33:58.736 --> 34:00.771
The time is 6:24p.m.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.475
- What's that?

34:08.079 --> 34:09.179
- It's a talking watch.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.149
You program it
and it tells you the time.

34:13.117 --> 34:14.418
It's kind of hard
to know what time it is

34:14.420 --> 34:15.685
when it's always dark.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.521
- Can't be that dark
with your natural glow.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.393
- What is this?

34:25.263 --> 34:26.563
- It's a bear.

34:28.466 --> 34:29.666
- You got me a bear?

34:29.668 --> 34:31.188
- Yeah, it's supposed
to be a surprise.

34:31.502 --> 34:33.335
- Honey, that's really sweet.

34:33.338 --> 34:34.438
- That's me.

34:45.583 --> 34:48.318
- Are you coming?
- Be there in a minute.

34:51.789 --> 34:52.822
Lovey!
- What?

34:54.324 --> 34:55.659
- Leela's dog!

34:55.661 --> 34:59.496
- What are you talking about?
- Come on. Leela lost her dog.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.597
I think I hear her.

35:04.368 --> 35:06.736
Come on.
C'mon.

35:06.738 --> 35:07.838
C'mon.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.381
- Oh...
- Shh. Lovey!

35:22.587 --> 35:24.488
- What are you doing?
- Shh! Lovey!

35:25.356 --> 35:26.289
I know you're in here, baby.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.291
Come here!
Come here!

35:28.293 --> 35:29.293
Come here!
Come here!

35:31.195 --> 35:32.829
- Jesus...
- My gosh, what're you...

35:32.831 --> 35:34.397
Told you I heard her.

35:34.399 --> 35:35.499
I knew it.

35:35.501 --> 35:37.300
Oh. Oh, baby.

35:37.802 --> 35:40.270
Oh. How'd you get in here?

35:40.272 --> 35:41.671
- How did you know?

35:41.673 --> 35:43.073
- I told you
that I heard something.

35:44.675 --> 35:45.775
What is this?

35:45.777 --> 35:47.210
- Oh, it looks like a dog toy.

35:50.248 --> 35:52.482
- No. This is a doll.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.584
- Mm, Leela's a strange bird.

35:54.586 --> 35:55.886
She came by the house again?

35:55.888 --> 35:58.155
You two buddies now?
- Yeah.

35:58.157 --> 36:00.257
She seems to be
very fond of you.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.458
Mm...
- Aw, she's just...

36:01.460 --> 36:02.926
She's lived here a long time.

36:02.928 --> 36:06.196
I've seen her around when I came
by to work on the place.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.831
- Uh-huh. Ooh.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.766
Here, we need to get you home.
Mommy's missing you.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.301
Here.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.770
Take that.

36:15.873 --> 36:17.507
Oh, don't forget the doll.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.642
- Oh, come on.

36:43.801 --> 36:44.901
- I love the bear.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.133
- What have you and Leela
been talking about?

36:51.876 --> 36:53.543
- Mm, just girl stuff.

36:54.679 --> 36:55.779
Don't worry about it.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.282
- Yeah.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.480
- Don't let me go!

38:12.456 --> 38:14.376
- No, no, no! No, no, no...
- What is it, honey?

38:14.692 --> 38:16.526
Oh, it's okay.
Shh. It's okay.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.761
It was just a bad dream.

38:18.429 --> 38:19.796
- How could I let that happen?

38:19.798 --> 38:22.499
- Oh, she shouldn't
have been wandering off.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.536
- I have to get some water.
- I'll get it for you.

38:26.538 --> 38:28.505
- No, I have to do it myself.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.508
- But you're upset.
- I'm okay.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.957
Arthur, I told you
that I can do it myself.

39:34.638 --> 39:35.772
Is anybody out here?

39:42.646 --> 39:43.780
Arthur?

39:51.055 --> 39:52.655
- Easy.

39:52.657 --> 39:53.890
What are you doing?

39:53.892 --> 39:56.826
- I heard something.
- Oh, again?

39:56.828 --> 39:58.628
Come on. Let's go to bed.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.529
- No, I heard it.
It was right...

39:59.531 --> 40:00.597
I heard...
- Stop!

40:00.599 --> 40:01.831
There is nothing out here.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.066
I took the dog back.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.702
You could've really
hurt yourself this time.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.771
- Oh, believe me, I did.
- Look, I just...

40:08.773 --> 40:13.109
I think you're just making
too much out of nothing.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.478
Okay? You have to let it go.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.613
It was an accident.

40:44.141 --> 40:45.542
I left you some extra money.

40:46.143 --> 40:49.012
Go out. Get a massage,
or go on a picnic.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.780
You need to relax.

40:56.053 --> 40:57.187
I'll see you later.

41:15.706 --> 41:16.706
- This was Arthur's idea.

41:17.241 --> 41:18.908
- Mm-hmm.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.643
Si, señora.

41:20.645 --> 41:22.645
You y el doctor
have a very nice property.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.015
- Well, as long as I'm out
here, will you tell me

41:26.017 --> 41:27.550
what I'm missing?

41:29.253 --> 41:30.954
- The trees, the grass...

41:31.755 --> 41:32.889
The usual things.

41:34.191 --> 41:38.161
- Describe it.
- We have sun.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.662
We have the flores.

41:40.564 --> 41:41.965
Señora, all is good.

41:48.873 --> 41:49.973
I bring you the food now.

41:51.542 --> 41:52.582
- Tell me about the birds.

41:55.546 --> 41:56.613
- No. No birds.

41:57.948 --> 41:59.015
Donde, aquí.

42:01.886 --> 42:03.219
Ah, maybe one over there,

42:03.221 --> 42:04.554
a black one.

42:05.222 --> 42:06.890
Just one.

42:06.892 --> 42:08.024
Ooh.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.059
Ay, señora.
I'm tired.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.561
I sit.

42:19.803 --> 42:21.604
- Rosa?

42:21.606 --> 42:25.808
Hey.
Rosa.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.610
- Hmm?

42:27.612 --> 42:28.892
- How long have you
known Arthur?

42:32.082 --> 42:33.650
- I'll tell you if you tell me.

42:33.652 --> 42:34.784
Que tal?

42:36.554 --> 42:37.687
- Deal.

42:39.323 --> 42:40.623
- I don't know.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.452
Whenever he needs something,
he call me.

42:46.163 --> 42:47.597
- How often does he come here?

42:48.098 --> 42:49.599
- Your turn.

42:51.869 --> 42:53.749
- Well, my father was ill
for a couple of years.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.072
And Arthur was his doctor,

42:56.074 --> 42:59.242
and used to come
by the house once a week

42:59.244 --> 43:00.577
to check on him.

43:02.913 --> 43:05.214
- Sometimes...
- Sometimes what?

43:06.083 --> 43:07.951
- Sometimes he come,
sometimes he go.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.240
- Does he ever
bring anybody here?

43:13.123 --> 43:14.657
- Where's your father?

43:16.594 --> 43:19.662
- He died 2 years ago.

43:20.965 --> 43:22.965
And then Arthur and I got
married right after that.

43:23.901 --> 43:25.001
- Hmm.

43:25.903 --> 43:27.070
I don't know, Señora.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.371
I never see anybody.

43:28.373 --> 43:29.672
I just clean.

43:35.245 --> 43:37.285
- Rosa, do you ever hear
weird noises in this house?

43:42.886 --> 43:43.987
Rosa?

43:47.191 --> 43:48.224
- Sometimes...
- You do?

43:49.159 --> 43:50.293
What kind of noises?

43:54.698 --> 43:55.978
- Sometimes I cannot
find things.

43:58.102 --> 43:59.168
- Do you think that maybe
this house could be haunted?

43:59.170 --> 44:00.403
- It's late, Señora.

44:01.171 --> 44:02.672
Let's go inside.

44:04.742 --> 44:06.109
I have to do the laundry.

44:06.111 --> 44:08.277
Y el doctor likes
all of his shirts to be ironed.

44:10.781 --> 44:12.215
- He likes things
the way he likes them.

44:12.217 --> 44:13.349
- Si, vamono.

44:14.885 --> 44:16.185
Up.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.286
There's a pool in front.

44:19.256 --> 44:20.390
Slowly.

44:25.763 --> 44:26.896
Good.

44:34.805 --> 44:36.305
- What is this?
- It's a doll.

44:41.979 --> 44:44.447
- This is Lovey's doll.
What's it doing here?

44:44.449 --> 44:46.182
- I don't know.

44:46.184 --> 44:47.717
Maybe he drop it?

44:48.185 --> 44:49.585
- Nobody told me
he brought it back.

44:51.088 --> 44:52.689
- I don't know, señora.
Maybe he drop it.

44:54.458 --> 44:55.758
Vamono.

45:12.009 --> 45:13.309
- Hi, honey.

45:13.311 --> 45:15.378
- Hey. You look good.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.813
Did you get out like I told you?

45:16.815 --> 45:18.147
- I did.

45:18.149 --> 45:19.282
I found something.

45:23.020 --> 45:24.700
You said that
you brought it back to Leela.

45:25.155 --> 45:26.756
- I don't know.
I guess I forgot.

45:26.758 --> 45:27.957
I got a lot on my mind.

45:27.959 --> 45:29.192
You know, patients,

45:30.194 --> 45:32.228
you and what you're
going through...

45:32.230 --> 45:34.030
- But I handed it to you.
- I don't know.

45:34.032 --> 45:35.164
I guess I forgot.

45:36.834 --> 45:38.334
- Well, we need
to give it back to her.

45:38.336 --> 45:39.368
The dog's going
to come back for it.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.070
- Okay.
I'll take it back later.

45:41.805 --> 45:43.245
- No.
You need to call her right now.

45:45.342 --> 45:47.310
- Okay. I'll call her.

45:47.312 --> 45:48.411
- Okay. Put it on speaker.

45:52.883 --> 45:54.016
- She's not home.

45:54.985 --> 45:56.352
- Hi, there.
- Leela!

45:56.354 --> 45:58.387
- Yes, it's me,
but I'm not here.

45:58.389 --> 45:59.756
So you know what to do.

46:01.058 --> 46:02.225
- Guess she's not home.

46:02.227 --> 46:03.359
We'll try again later.

48:34.144 --> 48:35.177
- It's my doll.

48:37.281 --> 48:38.414
- Arthur, where are you?

48:39.483 --> 48:40.549
- What happened?
- Oh, my god.

48:40.551 --> 48:43.953
I saw a little girl. Oh, no.

48:43.955 --> 48:47.056
- It was just a dream.
- No. No, she was here.

48:47.058 --> 48:48.691
I was awake.
I was not in bed.

48:48.693 --> 48:53.195
- You were sleepwalking.
- No. It was real. It was real.

48:53.197 --> 48:55.531
- Helen, you have got
to stop this.

48:55.533 --> 48:57.099
- No. No, you...
- You're going insane...

48:57.101 --> 49:00.136
- No...
- And you're driving me crazy.

49:00.138 --> 49:01.938
- Why don't you believe me?
- You're upset.

49:01.940 --> 49:03.506
- No, I'm not.
- You need to calm down.

49:03.508 --> 49:05.308
- No! I saw her!

49:05.310 --> 49:07.576
- I'll get you something.
- No, I don't want anything!

49:07.578 --> 49:09.946
It was real!
Please, no.

49:09.948 --> 49:11.647
I don't want anything.

49:11.649 --> 49:12.715
No, no, no, no.

49:12.717 --> 49:14.183
Please.

49:15.419 --> 49:16.619
- Sit...
- No, no...

49:16.621 --> 49:18.721
- And wait for me here.
- It was the girl.

49:18.723 --> 49:20.056
She was here.

49:21.058 --> 49:22.425
She won't let me be free.

49:27.597 --> 49:29.231
- Put it in your mouth
and swallow.

49:29.233 --> 49:31.267
- No, I don't...
- Do it, or I'll do it for you.

49:32.269 --> 49:33.536
- It happened.
- I know.

49:35.539 --> 49:36.572
That's a good girl.

49:42.079 --> 49:44.981
- When's it going to stop?
- When you forgive yourself.

49:44.983 --> 49:46.215
Now, lie down.

49:46.217 --> 49:47.350
- How can I forgive myself?

49:48.218 --> 49:49.552
I was such an idiot.

49:50.287 --> 49:52.688
Trying to take care
of a bunch of little girls

49:52.690 --> 49:54.323
when I can't even be a real mom.

49:55.258 --> 49:56.658
- You were just
trying to give back.

49:57.427 --> 49:58.507
- I was playing with dolls.

49:59.763 --> 50:01.464
- Just get some sleep, princess.

50:01.466 --> 50:02.598
You'll feel better
in the morning.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.500
- Doll... The doll.
She took the doll.

50:04.502 --> 50:06.535
- No, no, no. Lie down.

50:06.537 --> 50:08.537
- She did. She took it.
- Get some rest.

50:12.542 --> 50:13.642
That's a good girl.

50:17.681 --> 50:19.015
- Good morning, señora.

50:19.017 --> 50:20.583
You sleeping late today.

50:20.585 --> 50:23.486
El doctor, he left.
- Did he say anything?

50:23.488 --> 50:25.654
- He say he want
me to wash the patio.

50:26.323 --> 50:29.058
- No, I mean about last night.
- No, señora.

50:29.060 --> 50:31.160
Mira. These come for you today.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.632
- Is there a card?
- Si, señora.

50:36.634 --> 50:37.767
Tenga.

50:39.736 --> 50:43.072
- Well, what does it say?
- Oh, no, señora.

50:43.540 --> 50:45.207
No, no. My English
is no good for reading.

50:45.209 --> 50:46.108
- No, no, no...
- Talking, yes,

50:46.110 --> 50:47.376
pero reading, no.

50:47.378 --> 50:50.146
- Please try.
- Okay. I try.

50:52.516 --> 50:55.117
"For gift, you silly Helen.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.186
I love you.

50:57.721 --> 50:58.821
Arthur."

50:59.556 --> 51:00.656
I take this.

51:00.658 --> 51:04.093
- I think this has all
been a lot for him too.

51:04.095 --> 51:05.828
Don't you think?

51:05.830 --> 51:07.229
- I don't know, señora.

51:07.231 --> 51:08.631
Mira.

51:08.633 --> 51:11.300
My mother always say that
if you do something

51:11.302 --> 51:14.637
to make your husband sad,
make him a nice dinner.

51:15.405 --> 51:16.772
He forget about everything.

51:20.110 --> 51:22.178
- Let's do it.
- Yes?

51:22.180 --> 51:23.512
- Mm-hmm.
- Vamono.

51:26.450 --> 51:27.583
Hola, señora.

51:28.718 --> 51:29.819
I'm setting the table.

51:34.825 --> 51:37.259
- I think we need some wine.
- Oh, el doctor has wine.

51:38.562 --> 51:40.496
- Where is it?
- In the basement.

51:41.431 --> 51:42.765
- He keeps wine in the basement?

51:42.767 --> 51:45.634
- When the boxes come, I just
put 'em in the front door.

51:46.336 --> 51:47.856
He likes to put
the wine there himself.

51:48.639 --> 51:51.507
Will you take me down there
so I can see what we have?

52:12.529 --> 52:13.629
Is this it?

52:13.631 --> 52:15.831
- Si, señora.
- Well, open the door.

52:15.833 --> 52:17.533
- No, señora.

52:17.535 --> 52:19.235
El doctor say to me
never to go in.

52:19.237 --> 52:21.504
I don't want to do something
to make him upset with me.

52:21.506 --> 52:22.605
- Okay, fine.
I get it.

52:23.273 --> 52:24.406
I'll be the bad girl.

53:24.834 --> 53:27.403
- What happened, señora?
- Nothing. I just got scared.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.640
- Let's go, señora, before...

53:31.642 --> 53:33.642
Let's go.
- You know what?

53:33.644 --> 53:34.777
You go.
You go.

53:37.781 --> 53:39.281
- Okay.

53:57.767 --> 54:05.767
- No! Call Arthur work.

54:12.649 --> 54:13.749
- Doctor Boto's office.

54:15.785 --> 54:17.319
Hello?

54:17.321 --> 54:18.454
Can I help you?

54:19.889 --> 54:21.023
Hello?

54:44.514 --> 54:45.648
- This was really nice.

54:50.387 --> 54:51.787
I'll get us some more wine.

54:52.555 --> 54:55.891
- Oh, that's not necessary.
- It's not a problem.

54:55.893 --> 54:58.294
I can just get more
in the basement. We have plenty.

54:58.296 --> 55:00.729
- No, really. I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

55:00.731 --> 55:03.065
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I just thought...

55:04.000 --> 55:05.501
That's fine.

55:09.072 --> 55:10.773
- Are you still in love with me?

55:10.775 --> 55:12.608
- What kind
of silly question is that?

55:13.610 --> 55:14.890
- Do you sleep with me at night?

55:15.545 --> 55:16.845
- What are you talking about?

55:17.681 --> 55:18.881
- Are you sleeping
in the basement?

55:18.883 --> 55:20.382
- What?

55:20.384 --> 55:22.024
- I found pillows
and blankets down there.

55:22.752 --> 55:25.721
- This is absurd.
- Well, then what's going on?

55:25.723 --> 55:27.456
What's that stuff
doing down there?

55:27.458 --> 55:28.924
- I don't know.
This place hasn't been lived in

55:28.926 --> 55:30.359
for a long time.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.594
Maybe someone came in,
a squatter.

55:32.596 --> 55:34.496
- But you've been down there.
You've put away wine.

55:34.498 --> 55:37.533
- Maybe I stored some stuff
and forgot about it.

55:37.535 --> 55:38.634
What's the difference?

55:40.337 --> 55:41.737
I thought you were
moving on, Helen.

55:42.639 --> 55:44.573
I thought that's
what this dinner was about.

55:45.475 --> 55:46.608
- It was.

55:47.577 --> 55:49.511
Something's not right.

55:49.513 --> 55:50.553
- You're not right, Helen.

55:51.715 --> 55:52.715
I've had enough.

57:14.764 --> 57:16.665
- And you sit there.

57:18.034 --> 57:19.601
And maybe...

57:21.938 --> 57:23.439
Good.

57:23.873 --> 57:26.074
Now, wait.

57:26.076 --> 57:28.644
Everyone's going
to get their turn.

57:31.981 --> 57:33.015
The tea's almost ready.

57:34.217 --> 57:35.551
Who's been good?

57:41.191 --> 57:43.058
You're being very good,

57:43.893 --> 57:46.028
sitting straight and quiet.

57:48.531 --> 57:49.531
You can have your tea.

57:52.035 --> 57:54.870
Careful, it might be hot.

58:02.779 --> 58:07.516
Dolly, I have something
special for you.

58:09.052 --> 58:10.152
It's a surprise.

58:12.222 --> 58:19.161
Introducing Teddy the bear.

58:21.130 --> 58:22.598
Doctor brought us a new friend.

58:25.101 --> 58:26.535
He's so good when he tries.

58:33.776 --> 58:35.844
Teddy, meet Dolly.

58:38.515 --> 58:39.948
Well, how do you
do, Mr. Bear?

58:41.584 --> 58:42.584
Very well, thank you.

58:43.520 --> 58:45.621
Please, call me Teddy.

58:47.557 --> 58:48.991
He's a pretty cool bear.

58:48.993 --> 58:50.526
Right, Dolly?

58:51.160 --> 58:52.294
Oh, yes.

58:53.162 --> 58:54.663
I love teddy bears.

58:56.266 --> 58:57.566
I started to worry, though,

58:58.968 --> 59:01.036
when you brought
that woman here, Agnes.

59:06.009 --> 59:08.810
Oh, you don't need
to worry about that.

59:10.813 --> 59:14.249
Doctor said
she means nothing to him.

59:16.553 --> 59:22.257
Besides, she's blind, useless

59:23.826 --> 59:26.061
and going cuckoo,

59:28.231 --> 59:29.331
he said.

59:30.667 --> 59:32.034
But what if she stays?

59:38.107 --> 59:40.609
Then I'll take care of her.

59:44.714 --> 59:46.615
Now, let's stop
this boring conversation.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.821
Doctor said he's
going to bring us

59:52.823 --> 59:55.691
something really special
for our tea parties.

59:55.693 --> 59:56.725
What is it?
What is it?

59:57.961 --> 01:00:02.030
It's a real bell
to call for tea.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.033
Hooray!

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:08.937
Let's cheer for the doctor.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.609
Hip hip hooray!

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:36.331
- What's the matter?

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:42.304
- Oh, I'm just thirsty.
- Everything okay?

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.140
- Yeah.

01:00:46.142 --> 01:00:47.422
- You don't look so good, Helen.

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:51.413
We have to do something
about these nightmares,

01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:53.649
put an end to them.

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:54.691
- Yeah, they have to stop.

01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:00.722
- Let's get back to bed.

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.085
- I think I'm going
to take a bath.

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:05.394
- You really need...

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.864
- Yeah. Yeah, I need to relax.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.300
- Whatever you need.

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:18.006
- Ooh!

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:19.841
- You okay in there?

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.444
- I'm fine.

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.683
- You need me
to turn on the water?

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.687
- No, I got it.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:35.357
- Let me help you.

01:01:37.293 --> 01:01:41.463
- I'm okay.
- You sure?

01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:43.799
- I'm just going
to be a while, okay?

01:01:43.801 --> 01:01:44.801
Just get some rest.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.490
The time is 11:31.

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:11.393
- Rosa?

01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:15.330
Rosa.

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:27.409
Call Rosa.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.814
Rosa, where are you?

01:02:34.016 --> 01:02:35.117
Why aren't you here?

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.054
He told you not to come?

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.224
No, no, no.
That's not true.

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:45.227
I need you here.
Can't you get a bus?

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:48.497
Or... Okay, forget it.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.932
Come tomorrow, okay?

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.511
Call Leela.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.782
Leela!

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:08.884
Something's going on.

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.060
Oh, no.
- What's the matter?

01:03:19.062 --> 01:03:20.062
What's wrong, sweetie?

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:24.566
- I need to have you look
in the basement for me, okay?

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:26.134
- Okay.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:27.435
Why?

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:29.557
- There's something strange.

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.373
- Strange?

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:40.315
- What do you see?

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.584
- Wine.

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:45.821
- No. What else?
- Nothing.

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:51.359
- What about blankets
and pillows and stuff like that?

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:54.863
- What are you talking about?

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:56.565
This is a basement.

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:59.534
It's full of boxes.

01:03:59.536 --> 01:04:01.837
- But it was here.
I know it was.

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.606
- Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:05.941
Of course I'm sure.

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.379
- So, you're saying
you think I imagined it?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:15.150
- I think the mind
is a funny thing, darling,

01:04:15.152 --> 01:04:16.551
especially after trauma.

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:18.920
Believe me, I know.

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:21.489
My friend, Susie, she had
this brain thing going on.

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.491
She could swear
she was Diana Ross.

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:25.227
- No, no, no.
I felt it.

01:04:25.229 --> 01:04:26.528
I heard a little girl, okay?

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:27.896
She was talking
and she was playing.

01:04:27.898 --> 01:04:29.264
It was so real.

01:04:29.266 --> 01:04:30.546
- I think
you should tell Arthur.

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.602
- No.
- He is a doctor.

01:04:33.604 --> 01:04:36.605
On some kind
of drug or something.

01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:39.007
That's what he thinks,
is that drugs fix everything.

01:04:39.009 --> 01:04:40.689
But they don't,
and they didn't fix my dad.

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:43.011
- Honey, relax.

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:44.913
- Arthur used to come
to my house every week

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.948
to check on my dad,
always saying that the drugs

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.550
he was giving him
were making him better.

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:50.585
And then, 2 years later,
my dad died.

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:53.622
- I think you should
give him a chance.

01:04:53.624 --> 01:04:55.523
It's also a stressful time
for him too.

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:58.260
- Maybe.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:04:59.628
- Sweetie, I gotta go.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:02.097
I have this big showing
this afternoon.

01:05:02.099 --> 01:05:04.432
But I can come back later
if you need me.

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:05.934
Do not worry.

01:05:05.936 --> 01:05:06.968
Relax.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.436
Everything's going to be fine.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:38.633
- Helen?

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:45.974
Honey, I'm home.

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.682
- What are you doing home?
- I came home early.

01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:55.150
I wanted to spend
some time with you.

01:05:56.152 --> 01:05:57.452
- Well, I don't.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:05:59.521
That was a joke.

01:05:59.523 --> 01:06:01.156
- Huh. Funny.

01:06:01.158 --> 01:06:02.490
I'm going to change.

01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:11.700
Did you fall?

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:13.468
- No, I just...
- What are you doing?

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:16.104
- I just... What is this?

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.205
- Nothing.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:20.041
Come on.

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.744
We've had such a time.

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:24.746
I know it's been hard.
I want to make it up to you.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.016
- No, I'm fine.
- I'm taking you out.

01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:29.117
Get dressed.

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:30.518
- I'm...

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.386
You know, I'd really
rather not, Arthur.

01:06:31.388 --> 01:06:32.654
- It'll be fun.

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.255
I'm going to take a shower.

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:35.537
You get yourself all
prettied up.

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:11.292
Aren't you getting ready?

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:13.495
- Yeah. I'm almost ready.

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.293
- You look amazing.

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:50.498
- You would never keep anything
from me, would you?

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.133
- Let's not get too deep.

01:07:52.135 --> 01:07:53.468
Let's just go.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:54.469
- No, I don't really
want to go anywhere.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:57.372
Can we just order something in?

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:58.374
- It'll do you good.

01:07:58.841 --> 01:07:59.961
You've been inside too much.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:05.346
- Please?
- Okay.

01:08:24.466 --> 01:08:25.834
You're just funny as all.

01:08:25.836 --> 01:08:29.504
That's just a little bit more.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.407
What a year.

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.541
This whole year.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.544
Nothing...

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:06.908
- What was that?
- Just an animal outside.

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:08.609
- No, something just
broke in the kitchen.

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:11.513
- Yeah, somethin' broke.
- No. Arthur, somebody's here.

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:13.180
- It's nothing.

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:14.816
It's nothing.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:17.417
Let's go upstairs.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.765
Will you put that outfit
on for me?

01:10:52.982 --> 01:10:54.282
Are you coming?

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:04.559
Come on, already.
I'm waiting.

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:10.431
Looking for the dog again?

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:12.533
- No. I just fell.

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:28.549
- Okay.

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:29.951
One last toast.

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:47.869
To a new start.

01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:52.840
What's wrong?

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:54.842
- I don't know.
I think I had too much already.

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.244
- Well, one more.
It's good for you.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:01.783
The wine's good, isn't it?

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.585
- I have to call Rosa.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:06.321
- Now?

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:08.123
- I have to make sure
that she comes tomorrow.

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:10.217
Why did you say
you dismissed her today?

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:13.428
Have you seen my phone?

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:14.529
- We don't have to do this now.

01:12:14.531 --> 01:12:15.763
We can call her tomorrow.

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.567
- Wait. So why did you...

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:23.037
I think I need to lay down.

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:26.774
- That's a good idea.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:28.776
Lay down.

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:30.978
Have some more wine.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.113
Get some rest.

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:36.351
- No. I just want to rest.

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.490
- Okay.

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.727
You get some rest.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:49.964
I'll be back.

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:23.791
- She stays, or I stay.

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:28.930
She stays.

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:31.999
I stay.

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:35.570
She stays.

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:39.574
I stay.

01:14:42.678 --> 01:14:43.778
She stays.

01:14:47.883 --> 01:14:49.183
I stay.

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.488
I will stay in this house.

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.595
You promised you'd get
rid of her soon.

01:15:01.997 --> 01:15:03.531
- She's done.

01:15:03.533 --> 01:15:04.665
Trust me.

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:08.102
Drink some milk.

01:15:09.137 --> 01:15:10.505
Stop it!

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.641
Drink some milk.

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:21.182
Now eat the cookie.
- No.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:22.984
- Do you want
to go back to that place?

01:15:22.986 --> 01:15:24.519
I got you out of there.

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:25.586
I can send you back
to that hell.

01:15:25.588 --> 01:15:26.687
Is that what you want?

01:15:28.156 --> 01:15:31.859
You will stop
making these noises.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:36.163
- You will stop
appearing in places

01:15:36.165 --> 01:15:37.832
that you do not belong.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.268
You will stay in the cellar
like a good little girl

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:41.969
until I have figured this out.

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:58.272
- You love me
more than her, don't you?

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.621
- Of course I do.

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:02.790
I love you the most.

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:07.695
You just have to listen
to what I say.

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:14.669
After tonight, it'll just
be you and me.

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:17.972
- I'm tired of hiding.

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:20.942
I love you.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:28.182
- Promise me you'll do as I say.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:30.651
- Promise.

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:38.192
- I love you too, princess.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:22.303
We have to find her.

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:31.245
Helen, darling, where are you?

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:33.214
You can't hide from me.

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:48.896
- Lila.
- Hello?

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:50.798
- Hello? Hi, there.

01:17:51.266 --> 01:17:53.200
- Hello?
- It's Helen. I...

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:56.103
- Helen?
- Helen?

01:17:57.272 --> 01:17:58.406
Hello?

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:09.417
- Doctor?

01:18:10.919 --> 01:18:13.821
Is that you?
Doctor, she's here!

01:18:17.793 --> 01:18:19.226
- Listen to me.
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:20.461
I'm not going to hurt you.
I have a secret to tell you.

01:18:20.463 --> 01:18:21.583
I have a secret to tell you.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:24.131
Quiet. Shh.
I swear.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:25.766
The doctor's not good, okay?

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:27.328
- Shut up!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:28.836
Shh.
Shh. Shh.

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:31.839
So the bear, the bear, the bear,

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:33.140
it was for you, wasn't it?

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:34.942
Wasn't it?
But he gave it to me.

01:18:36.745 --> 01:18:38.105
You had to come get it,
didn't you?

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:42.717
What's your name?

01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:46.353
- Agnes.

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:48.355
- Agnes, what the doctor's
doing to you...

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.026
He's sick, okay?
He's really sick.

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:55.396
He got close to me
when I lost my dad

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.065
and I needed someone.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.300
Now, I'm no good
for him anymore.

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:00.935
He's just gonna do
the same thing to you.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:03.904
- He loves me!
- Oh! No, stop it!

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.439
You have to believe me.

01:19:05.441 --> 01:19:07.141
He's going to hurt you, okay?

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:08.442
- You're right.

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:11.345
I'm prettier than you.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.380
That's why he loves me more.

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:17.985
He says my kisses
are like strawberries.

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.421
He calls me his princess.

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:24.225
- Of course he does.
- We don't need you.

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:26.460
We'll get rid of you.

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:27.394
- He can't be trusted, okay?

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:29.330
He lies.
- You're the liar.

01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:31.405
- Did he tell you
that we're married?

01:19:35.303 --> 01:19:39.106
- No. He's married to me.

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:44.078
- At your age, you should be
playing with other girls,

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.780
not thinking
about being married.

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:53.233
I don't want to go back there.
They're so mean to me.

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.569
- I'm going
to help you find another place.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.294
- You can't even help yourself.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:04.932
- Agnes, you have
to trust me, okay?

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:06.033
We have to get out of here.

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:28.088
- Helen?

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.963
Darling?

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:08.395
- Hey, handsome. Busy?
- Yes, very.

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:11.365
- I came to see Helen.
Where is she?

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:13.434
- She's out.
- Out?

01:21:13.436 --> 01:21:16.437
She just called me, sounded
like she needed some help.

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:18.239
- What the hell
are you talking about?

01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:20.040
- Take a chill pill, mister.

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:22.509
She probably just
wanted some girl talk.

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.345
- Sure.

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.147
I think she's taking a shower.

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:28.916
- No problem.

01:21:28.918 --> 01:21:30.050
I can wait.

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:32.253
Fix me a drink?

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:35.956
- No.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:43.230
- Do you want to join me?

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:49.103
You know, Arthur, you should be
playing with girls your own age.

01:21:49.105 --> 01:21:50.237
- Doctor, I found her!

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.940
- Hey!
- She's in the bedroom.

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:54.408
I found her.
- Not now!

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:57.945
- Oh.

01:21:57.947 --> 01:22:00.214
That's a very
dangerous-looking knife.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:05.052
- I was just doing something
in the kitchen.

01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:08.222
- Who's the girl?
- My niece, visiting.

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:14.995
- Isn't she a little princess?

01:22:17.032 --> 01:22:18.098
- My name's Agnes.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:20.267
And I'm not his niece.

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:22.169
I'm his wife.

01:22:22.171 --> 01:22:23.938
- Shut up, Agnes.

01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:25.272
Go play.

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:27.641
She's funny.

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:31.858
- What the hell's going on here?

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:35.282
- She's a spoiled brat.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:37.518
She's not actually my niece,

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.087
just a girl trying to help out.

01:22:40.089 --> 01:22:41.155
She's from a broken home.

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:44.358
- Helen, where are you?

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:46.627
Get out of my way, Arthur.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:48.395
- I told you she's busy!

01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:50.965
- Are you out of your mind?

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.167
Helen?

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:57.071
You know what?

01:22:58.206 --> 01:22:59.640
I'm calling the police.

01:22:59.642 --> 01:23:02.710
- You're not calling anyone.
- The hell I'm not!

01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:13.153
- Doctor!

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.193
- Where did you say Helen was?

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:25.366
Forget about this bitch
and answer my question.

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:30.070
Get back here, you little slut.

01:24:01.036 --> 01:24:03.404
Helen, I know you're in here.

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:07.708
Come out, my darling.

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:11.478
I won't hurt you.

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.517
The time is 11:31 p.m.

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:29.690
- Time's a-ticking.

01:25:31.226 --> 01:25:32.426
Time to face the music.

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:38.465
You have been running
from one thing

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:40.701
or another all your life, Helen.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:43.504
Time to be free of all that.

01:25:47.675 --> 01:25:48.775
There you are.

01:25:56.251 --> 01:25:58.651
You didn't have to do anything,
just sit there and be pretty.

01:25:59.854 --> 01:26:01.321
Isn't that what you wanted,

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:04.892
a knight in shining armor

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:08.795
to take you away
and put you in a castle?

01:26:12.267 --> 01:26:16.537
- Doctor, Teddy wants to say hi.

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:32.686
- Now, I got you both.
- Leave her alone, Arthur.

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:33.968
- You did it to yourself, Helen!

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:37.524
You fucking did it to yourself!

01:26:42.297 --> 01:26:45.465
- Arthur, do
whatever you want to me.

01:26:45.467 --> 01:26:46.700
But do not hurt her.

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:51.338
- Ah!

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.521
- Hey. Don't do that.

01:27:07.523 --> 01:27:09.256
Wait. Stop.
Don't go that close.

01:27:09.258 --> 01:27:10.290
Hey. Don't do that. Stop.

01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:11.892
When are they going to stop?

01:27:11.894 --> 01:27:13.014
- When you forgive yourself.

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:25.472
- Ah!
- Helen!

01:27:26.474 --> 01:27:27.608
Pull me up!

01:27:34.449 --> 01:27:35.749
Helen!

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.552
- Don't let me fall!
- Don't let me fall!

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:19.426
- You looked pretty today.
- So do you.

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.496
I like that pink ribbon.

01:28:28.670 --> 01:28:29.703
Got You
