00:20.253 --> 00:22.877
Will you please turn
your shirt off?

00:22.911 --> 00:24.055
What?

00:24.090 --> 00:25.733
I'm giving myself
dramatic entrance music.

00:25.768 --> 00:28.857
People will know I'm awesome
and to be feared.

00:28.891 --> 00:30.470
Right.

00:30.505 --> 00:32.822
There's nothing more awesome
and frightening than a man

00:32.856 --> 00:35.912
who's got music blasting
from between his nipples.

00:37.557 --> 00:39.941
Hey, Stuart,
what's going on?

00:39.975 --> 00:42.156
Well, you might want to mark
your Google calendars.

00:42.191 --> 00:44.742
Stan Lee is coming to do
a signing on Thursday.

00:44.776 --> 00:47.594
Did he finally write a sequel
to his autobiography?

00:47.629 --> 00:51.455
I'm sure ages 79 through 87
were just action-packed.

00:51.489 --> 00:54.274
No, just a regular
comic signing.

00:54.309 --> 00:57.801
My uncle is his dermatologist
and Stan's doing him a favor.

00:57.835 --> 01:00.151
Oh, I don't want
to know that!

01:00.186 --> 01:02.572
How can I possibly discuss
with Stan Lee

01:02.606 --> 01:04.183
the scientific foundations

01:04.218 --> 01:06.030
for interstellar flight
on a silver surfboard

01:06.066 --> 01:08.114
when part of my brain
will be scanning his face

01:08.148 --> 01:11.707
for signs of contagious
skin disease?

01:11.741 --> 01:15.199
Stan Lee does not have
a contagious skin disease.

01:15.233 --> 01:19.230
Well, look who thinks
he's Stuart's uncle now.

01:19.264 --> 01:20.438
Can't believe it.

01:20.472 --> 01:22.922
We're going to meet Stan Lee!

01:31.921 --> 01:34.671
I'm sad to say
I taught him those moves.

02:02.128 --> 02:03.035
I can't decide

02:02.969 --> 02:04.243
whether I want Stan Lee
to autograph

02:04.278 --> 02:06.895
<i>my Journey into Mystery 83,
first appearance of Thor</i>

02:06.931 --> 02:08.743
<i>or my Fantastic Four
number five,</i>

02:08.776 --> 02:11.698
first appearance of Dr. Doom.

02:20.832 --> 02:23.081
Alex, I'm going to go
with what is...

02:23.115 --> 02:25.263
you're a dumbass?

02:30.300 --> 02:33.690
I've decided I'm going to
have Mr. Lee sign my copy

02:33.724 --> 02:35.739
<i>of this month's Batman.</i>

02:35.773 --> 02:36.880
That's crazy.

02:36.915 --> 02:38.928
<i>Stan Lee had nothing
to do with Batman.</i>

02:38.963 --> 02:41.412
Yes, which is why no one else
will ask him to sign one,

02:41.447 --> 02:44.534
and I will be the possessor
of a unique, albeit
confusing, artifact,

02:44.569 --> 02:48.093
which will set me apart from
hoi polloi of comic book fandom.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.946
That's a great idea.

02:50.981 --> 02:54.170
<i>I'm going to get him
to sign a Batman as well.</i>

02:54.205 --> 02:57.964
What is it about the word
"unique" you don't understand?

02:57.999 --> 02:59.408
Ow!

02:59.442 --> 03:00.549
Damn, paper cut.

03:00.584 --> 03:01.792
Nothing worse than a paper cut.

03:01.826 --> 03:05.015
Well, obviously you don't
remember your circumcision.

03:07.366 --> 03:09.884
There's Neosporin and Band-Aids
in my top desk drawer.

03:09.918 --> 03:13.207
Why don't you keep that stuff
in the bathroom?

03:13.241 --> 03:14.617
He does. And in the kitchen.

03:14.652 --> 03:16.867
And in the car.
And in his pocket.

03:16.901 --> 03:19.384
Yeah, but the ones in
my pocket are mine.

03:20.527 --> 03:22.608
Hi!
Hey.

03:22.642 --> 03:24.622
Guess who's going to be at the
comic bookstore on Thursday?

03:24.656 --> 03:26.435
Um... can you give me a hint?

03:26.470 --> 03:28.282
Stan Lee.

03:28.316 --> 03:30.296
Um... Stanley...

03:30.330 --> 03:32.546
Stanley... Stanley Tucci?

03:32.580 --> 03:34.090
No.

03:34.125 --> 03:36.441
No, Stan... Lee.

03:36.475 --> 03:38.892
Oh, oh, Stan Lee!

03:38.927 --> 03:41.780
Cool!

03:41.815 --> 03:44.231
You have no idea
who he is, do you?

03:44.265 --> 03:46.179
Of course I do.

03:46.213 --> 03:48.058
You're an important
part of my life

03:48.093 --> 03:50.577
and I pay attention to the
things you are interested in.

03:50.611 --> 03:52.254
Oh, good.

03:52.289 --> 03:53.631
Good.

03:53.666 --> 03:54.873
So, who's Stan Lee?

03:54.908 --> 03:58.331
<i>Um... he was on Star Trek.</i>

04:01.253 --> 04:02.898
Nope.

04:02.932 --> 04:05.047
<i>Star Wars?
No.</i>

04:05.081 --> 04:06.860
Um... uh, Stan Lee.

04:06.894 --> 04:10.350
Ooh, he was in those goofy
kung fu movies you love so much?

04:10.386 --> 04:12.969
That's Bruce Lee.

04:13.004 --> 04:14.178
Oh.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.065
So, is this Bruce Lee's
nerdy brother, Stan?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.757
Sheldon, why do you have
all these unopened

04:20.793 --> 04:22.404
paychecks in your desk?

04:22.439 --> 04:24.519
Because most of the things
I'm planning to buy

04:24.554 --> 04:27.138
haven't been invented yet.

04:27.172 --> 04:29.823
There-there must be thousands
of dollars here.

04:29.857 --> 04:31.570
Why don't you put it
in the bank?

04:31.604 --> 04:33.047
I don't trust banks.

04:33.081 --> 04:34.961
I believe that when
the robots rise up,

04:34.995 --> 04:37.646
ATMs will lead the charge.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.199
You've also got something

04:40.233 --> 04:42.180
from the Pasadena
Municipal Court.

04:42.214 --> 04:45.067
Undoubtedly another
snide response

04:45.102 --> 04:46.779
to my repeated letters
complaining

04:46.814 --> 04:48.458
that the flags in front
of the courthouse

04:48.492 --> 04:49.565
are flying in the wrong order.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.209
From left to right,
it's supposed to be

04:51.245 --> 04:54.063
federal, state,
and then city of Pasadena.

04:54.097 --> 04:57.286
I'm sorry. You sent more
than one letter about that?

04:58.260 --> 05:00.878
It bothers me.

05:02.457 --> 05:03.799
Sheldon, this is a summons.

05:03.833 --> 05:05.443
A summons for what?

05:05.478 --> 05:09.003
Looks like you ran a red light
on Marengo Avenue

05:09.037 --> 05:12.495
at 9:30 p.m.
on November 16.

05:12.530 --> 05:13.737
They got you
on a traffic camera.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.860
Nice picture.

05:20.185 --> 05:22.367
November 16?

05:22.401 --> 05:24.884
Penny, that's the evening
you fell in your bathtub

05:24.920 --> 05:27.034
and I had to drive you
to the emergency room.

05:27.068 --> 05:28.478
No, it isn't.

05:28.512 --> 05:30.156
Yes, it is.

05:30.191 --> 05:31.768
No, it isn't.

05:31.802 --> 05:33.312
Penny, I have an
eidetic memory.

05:33.346 --> 05:35.494
Also, that's a picture of
you in the passenger seat

05:35.529 --> 05:37.173
holding your dislocated
shoulder.

05:37.207 --> 05:39.523
Mmm, no, it isn't.

05:41.170 --> 05:44.694
Okay, then why is a summons
for a traffic violation

05:44.729 --> 05:47.246
committed in your car,
bearing your license plates,

05:47.281 --> 05:49.026
coming to me?

05:54.332 --> 05:55.708
Okay, look, they sent me
the ticket.

05:55.742 --> 05:56.950
I told them
I wasn't driving

05:56.985 --> 05:58.830
and they were all,
"If it wasn't you, who was it?"

05:58.864 --> 06:00.844
So you betrayed me?

06:00.879 --> 06:01.986
No!

06:02.021 --> 06:03.463
It wasn't a betrayal.

06:03.498 --> 06:06.149
It was more of a "I can't afford
any more points on my license."

06:06.183 --> 06:07.526
I already have
to buy my insurance

06:07.560 --> 06:10.010
from this place
in the Cayman Islands.

06:10.044 --> 06:12.595
But the only reason
I was driving your car

06:12.629 --> 06:15.583
was because you were in distress
and I was rescuing you.

06:15.617 --> 06:16.758
Yes, yes, look, and now

06:16.793 --> 06:19.611
you have a photo to remember
that heroic day.

06:20.385 --> 06:22.632
It's not that big a deal.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.881
You just go down to the court
on Thursday

06:24.916 --> 06:25.956
and you pay the fine.

06:25.990 --> 06:27.835
I'm not going
to pay a fine.

06:27.870 --> 06:29.380
That would imply
I'm guilty.

06:29.414 --> 06:31.026
You are guilty.

06:35.458 --> 06:38.412
That one I liked.

06:40.428 --> 06:41.467
I am not guilty.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.079
I only have a
learner's permit.

06:43.114 --> 06:44.322
Penny was the teacher.

06:44.356 --> 06:46.437
When the light turned yellow
she said "Go, go, go."

06:46.471 --> 06:49.224
So I went, went, went.

06:49.258 --> 06:50.332
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.211
I'll be happy to reimburse you
for the fine.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.058
You know, as soon
as I get a part in a movie

06:54.092 --> 06:55.938
or my own TV series.

06:55.972 --> 06:58.490
You don't need to reimburse
me because I'm not paying.

06:58.524 --> 07:00.806
On Thursday, I will
have my day in court

07:00.841 --> 07:02.552
and justice will be done.

07:02.587 --> 07:05.809
In fact, I'm going to begin
preparing my defense right now.

07:07.421 --> 07:09.938
Okay, he's going to jail.

07:09.972 --> 07:12.020
Oh, that's right.

07:12.054 --> 07:14.168
Thursday is Stan Lee Day.

07:16.050 --> 07:18.197
Now you see what you've done?

07:19.441 --> 07:22.529
Because of you, we're all
going to miss Stan Lee.

07:22.563 --> 07:24.912
Whoa!

07:25.853 --> 07:27.463
What do you mean "all?"

07:27.497 --> 07:29.209
Well, you're my friends.

07:29.243 --> 07:31.760
You'll be standing
by my side, supporting me,

07:31.795 --> 07:33.271
feeding me
legal precedents,

07:33.306 --> 07:34.949
and if you had the
upper body strength,

07:34.984 --> 07:38.374
carrying me out on your
shoulders when I'm victorious.

07:39.315 --> 07:41.663
Yeah, okay. No.

07:41.697 --> 07:43.744
Are you saying that you
will not stand beside me

07:43.779 --> 07:45.222
as I plead my case?

07:45.256 --> 07:47.303
That's what I'm saying.

07:47.337 --> 07:48.714
Howard?

07:48.748 --> 07:49.754
Wow.

07:49.788 --> 07:52.742
Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court.

07:52.777 --> 07:54.791
<i>Uh, if this was Sophie's Choice</i>

07:54.825 --> 07:56.906
it would've been a much
shorter movie. No.

07:56.940 --> 07:58.853
Raj?

07:58.888 --> 08:00.162
You'll be there, won't you?

08:03.118 --> 08:05.501
All right, then.

08:05.535 --> 08:07.951
My so-called friends
have forsaken me.

08:07.986 --> 08:11.308
So, I guess it'll just be me
and my eyewitness.

08:11.343 --> 08:14.732
Oh, balls.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.008
Please try to wear something
appropriate.

08:16.042 --> 08:17.283
It won't help my case

08:17.317 --> 08:19.331
if the judge is busy trying
to read the word "Juicy"

08:19.366 --> 08:21.043
scrawled across your buttocks.

08:27.355 --> 08:28.831
Penny.

08:28.865 --> 08:30.241
Penny.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.390
Penny.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.712
That's just wrong.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.458
All right, let's go.

08:37.494 --> 08:38.501
Wait, hold on.

08:38.534 --> 08:40.179
Before we get to
the courthouse,

08:40.214 --> 08:43.201
I'd like to call on
your skills as an actress.

08:43.236 --> 08:44.510
What is this?

08:44.545 --> 08:45.686
I've taken the liberty

08:45.720 --> 08:47.634
of scripting your appearance
on the witness stand

08:47.668 --> 08:50.017
because, let's face it, you're
somewhat of a loose cannon.

08:50.052 --> 08:52.603
Now, don't worry; it's written
in your vernacular.

08:52.637 --> 08:54.013
So shall we rehearse?

08:54.048 --> 08:55.188
Do I have a choice?

08:55.223 --> 08:56.867
Well, of course
you have a choice.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.419
Although we live
in a deterministic universe,

08:59.454 --> 09:00.863
each individual has free will.

09:00.898 --> 09:02.912
Now, sit down.

09:02.947 --> 09:05.699
I call your attention

09:05.733 --> 09:07.713
to the events of November 16.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.157
Do you remember that date?

09:09.191 --> 09:12.850
"Darn tootin', I do.

09:14.026 --> 09:16.442
"If the court will excuse
my homespun,

09:16.476 --> 09:19.263
corn-fed Nebraskan
turn of phrase."

09:19.297 --> 09:21.479
That's excellent. Go on.

09:21.513 --> 09:23.963
"The reason that date is, like,

09:23.997 --> 09:26.414
"so totally fixed in my memory

09:26.448 --> 09:28.294
"is that I had the privilege
to be witness

09:28.328 --> 09:32.053
to one of the most heroic acts
I've ever seen in, like, ever."

09:33.833 --> 09:37.155
"And who performed
that heroic act?"

09:37.190 --> 09:38.800
"Why, you did, sir.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.117
"You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

09:41.152 --> 09:44.306
And may I add, it is
a privilege to know you."

09:45.650 --> 09:47.328
"There's no need
for compliments.

09:47.363 --> 09:49.309
This court is only interested
in the facts."

09:49.343 --> 09:53.303
"But it is a fact that
it's a privilege to know you.

09:53.338 --> 09:55.452
Totally."

09:56.695 --> 10:00.152
A teardrop rolls down my cheek?!

10:00.188 --> 10:01.631
Only a suggestion.

10:01.665 --> 10:04.115
A catch in your throat
would work just as well.

10:06.097 --> 10:08.077
"But it is a fact

10:08.111 --> 10:10.830
"that it's a privilege
to know you.

10:10.864 --> 10:13.012
Totally."

10:16.236 --> 10:19.256
Maybe you should put on
your "Juicy" pants again.

10:21.843 --> 10:23.352
Pay the cashier.

10:23.387 --> 10:26.273
Sheldon Cooper.

10:28.490 --> 10:30.436
Good morning, Your Honor.

10:30.471 --> 10:32.114
Dr. Sheldon Cooper

10:32.149 --> 10:33.826
appearing in pro se.

10:33.862 --> 10:36.042
That is to say,
representing himself.

10:36.077 --> 10:37.453
I know what it means.

10:37.487 --> 10:38.762
I went to law school.

10:38.797 --> 10:41.314
And yet you wound up
in traffic court.

10:42.557 --> 10:44.101
Anyway,

10:44.135 --> 10:45.276
if it would please the court,

10:45.310 --> 10:46.954
I'd like to begin
with an opening statement.

10:46.988 --> 10:48.095
The court would

10:48.130 --> 10:49.640
advise you to make it quick,

10:49.675 --> 10:52.427
as the court had a dicey-looking
breakfast burrito this morning

10:52.461 --> 10:54.340
and just took an Imodium.

10:55.382 --> 10:56.489
Very well.

10:56.524 --> 10:58.806
A quick opening statement.

10:58.841 --> 11:00.955
Like a milking stool,

11:00.989 --> 11:02.534
my case rests on

11:02.568 --> 11:03.776
three legs.

11:03.811 --> 11:05.153
I will demonstrate

11:05.187 --> 11:07.034
that I was improperly
instructed in driving

11:07.068 --> 11:09.451
by a woman whose lack of respect
for society

11:09.486 --> 11:10.928
borders on the sociopathic.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.841
I will argue

11:12.875 --> 11:15.292
that the emergency met
the legal doctrine

11:15.327 --> 11:17.374
<i>of quod est necessarium
est licitum--</i>

11:17.408 --> 11:19.624
that which is necessary
is legal.

11:19.658 --> 11:20.866
But first,

11:20.901 --> 11:22.814
I will raise
a Sixth Amendment issue.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.264
I'm unable
to confront my accuser,

11:25.299 --> 11:27.345
a non-human
entity, to wit,

11:27.381 --> 11:28.723
a camera.

11:28.757 --> 11:30.065
So, to sum up:

11:30.099 --> 11:31.106
improper instruction;

11:31.141 --> 11:33.154
<i>quod est necessarium
est licitum;</i>

11:33.189 --> 11:34.329
Sixth Amendment.

11:34.365 --> 11:36.243
My milk stool is complete.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.486
Impressive.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.190
Thank you.

11:38.224 --> 11:39.130
Guilty.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.111
Pay the cashier.

11:41.146 --> 11:42.454
I object.

11:42.488 --> 11:44.267
You're completely ignoring
the law.

11:44.302 --> 11:46.013
<i>No, I'm following the law.</i>

11:46.047 --> 11:47.859
<i>I'm ignoring you.</i>

11:47.895 --> 11:49.169
Really?

11:49.204 --> 11:52.593
I would point out that I am
at the top of my profession,

11:52.628 --> 11:55.514
while you preside
over the kiddy table of yours.

11:56.556 --> 11:58.602
Dr. Cooper,
before I find you in contempt

11:58.637 --> 12:01.793
and throw you in jail,
I'm going to give you a chance

12:01.827 --> 12:03.639
to apologize
for that last remark.

12:03.674 --> 12:05.351
I am a scientist.

12:05.385 --> 12:07.701
I never apologize for the truth.

12:14.183 --> 12:16.365
That's my spot.

12:22.646 --> 12:24.457
<i>♪
I can't wait to ask Stan Lee</i>

12:24.492 --> 12:27.748
why he insists on giving all his
characters first and last names

12:27.783 --> 12:29.426
that start with the same letter.

12:29.461 --> 12:31.877
Oh, come on.
Why would you do that?

12:31.911 --> 12:33.925
Bruce Banner, Reed Richards,

12:33.960 --> 12:35.603
Sue Storm, Stephen Strange,

12:35.638 --> 12:37.281
Otto Octavius,
Silver Surfer,

12:37.316 --> 12:39.531
Peter Parker, oh,
and worst of all,

12:39.565 --> 12:44.232
J. Jonah Jameson, Jr.

12:44.266 --> 12:46.113
Okay, I'm cutting.

12:46.147 --> 12:49.839
I'm not gonna talk to Stan Lee
after you cheese him off.

12:54.406 --> 12:55.749
Hey.

12:55.784 --> 12:57.193
Sheldon's in jail.

12:57.227 --> 12:58.536
Sheldon's in jail?!

12:58.570 --> 13:01.826
You called it.

13:01.860 --> 13:03.572
What do you think?
For what?

13:03.606 --> 13:05.686
For doing the same crap
he always does,

13:05.721 --> 13:07.062
except to a judge.

13:07.098 --> 13:09.949
He has to stay in there
until he apologizes.

13:09.984 --> 13:11.997
So tell him to apologize.

13:12.032 --> 13:13.340
Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard.

13:13.374 --> 13:15.253
That didn't occur to me.

13:15.288 --> 13:16.898
If he doesn't apologize by 5:00,

13:16.932 --> 13:18.878
he is going to spend the night
in jail.

13:18.912 --> 13:21.262
Oh, no, that's terrible.

13:21.296 --> 13:23.275
Ooh, the line's moving.
Got to go. Bye.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.025
Excuse me?

13:35.060 --> 13:36.469
Excuse me, jailor?

13:37.410 --> 13:38.785
What?

13:38.819 --> 13:40.498
I need to use the restroom.

13:40.532 --> 13:42.310
Knock yourself out.

13:44.996 --> 13:47.312
That's the toilet?

13:47.347 --> 13:49.527
Well, it ain't
a wishing well.

13:51.005 --> 13:53.959
Please tell the judge
I'm ready to apologize.

13:56.746 --> 13:58.591
Look at that.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.672
"To my friend, Leonard.

14:00.707 --> 14:03.626
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"

14:05.072 --> 14:06.111
Awesome.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.159
Mine says,
"To my friend, Howard.

14:08.193 --> 14:10.945
From Stan Lee, Excelsior!"

14:12.390 --> 14:15.410
Mine says,
"To Raj, from Stan Lee."

14:19.775 --> 14:21.990
That's 'cause you pissed him off
about his character names.

14:22.025 --> 14:23.266
Hey,

14:23.301 --> 14:26.187
I didn't even mention
Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin,

14:26.221 --> 14:27.966
Matt Murdock,
Pepper Potts,

14:28.001 --> 14:29.510
Victor Von Doom,

14:29.544 --> 14:31.558
oh, and worst of all,

14:31.593 --> 14:34.042
Millie the Model.

14:34.077 --> 14:35.888
We're home.

14:35.923 --> 14:37.769
Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go?

14:37.803 --> 14:39.716
You know very well
how it went.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.904
Yeah, but we all want
to hear it from you.

14:45.290 --> 14:47.706
I was found guilty
and fined $533.

14:47.740 --> 14:50.157
I'm going to write you
a check for that.

14:50.191 --> 14:52.171
As long as you promise
to put it in your drawer

14:52.206 --> 14:55.563
and never cash it,
like the others.

14:57.075 --> 14:58.954
I also now have
three points

14:58.989 --> 15:01.641
on a driver's license
I do not yet possess,

15:01.675 --> 15:04.024
and I was forced
to issue an undeserved apology,

15:04.058 --> 15:06.039
simply because
I refuse to urinate

15:06.073 --> 15:10.134
in a stainless steel bowl
in front of criminals.

15:10.169 --> 15:12.820
Plus, you didn't get
to meet Stan Lee.

15:13.728 --> 15:15.405
Okay, that's enough, Howard.

15:15.439 --> 15:17.453
The poor guy's
had a tough time.

15:17.487 --> 15:19.870
He had to spend
the entire afternoon in jail

15:19.904 --> 15:21.951
wearing that suit.

15:21.986 --> 15:25.006
You're right,

15:25.041 --> 15:26.484
so it would be cruel to mention

15:26.518 --> 15:27.794
that after he finished
signing autographs,

15:27.829 --> 15:31.420
Stanley took Stuart and us out
for gelato.

15:32.261 --> 15:35.516
You had gelato
with Stan Lee?

15:35.551 --> 15:37.866
He said we could call him Stan.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.988
Except for Raj.

15:45.354 --> 15:48.006
Well, I hope you're
satisfied, Penny.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.348
You are responsible

15:49.383 --> 15:52.908
for all the evil that
has befallen me today.

15:52.942 --> 15:54.687
Okay, I realize that...
Not finished.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.097
It is because of you

15:56.131 --> 15:57.843
that I now have
a criminal record,

15:57.877 --> 16:00.227
and it is because of you
that I missed out

16:00.261 --> 16:01.972
on having gelato
with Stan Lee.

16:02.008 --> 16:04.290
Okay, maybe you'll have
another chance to have...
No, no.

16:04.324 --> 16:07.479
I will never have another chance
to have gelato with Stan Lee

16:07.513 --> 16:09.024
because
opportunities to have

16:09.059 --> 16:12.046
gelato with Stan Lee come
but once in a lifetime.

16:12.081 --> 16:16.747
"The moving finger writes,
and having writ, moves on!"

16:21.314 --> 16:25.612
Did he just somehow
give me the finger?

16:25.646 --> 16:27.223
Not just the finger.

16:27.257 --> 16:29.908
The moving finger.

16:32.293 --> 16:34.910
Hey, Stuart.

16:34.945 --> 16:37.630
Oh, hey, Penny.

16:37.665 --> 16:40.685
Wow. Hi.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.262
What's going on?
Nothing.

16:42.296 --> 16:45.821
I'm just getting ready to
close up and... head out.

16:45.855 --> 16:47.265
Ah.

16:47.299 --> 16:49.111
Cool. Got any fun plans?

16:49.146 --> 16:51.999
Oh, yeah. Big night tonight.

16:52.033 --> 16:54.685
Gonna share a can of tuna

16:54.720 --> 16:56.934
with the cat.

16:56.968 --> 16:58.982
Oh, nice.

16:59.016 --> 17:00.425
Not even my cat.

17:00.460 --> 17:02.205
I just feed it.

17:02.239 --> 17:05.394
Some nights it
doesn't even show up.

17:05.428 --> 17:06.871
Oh, okay.

17:06.906 --> 17:08.887
Well, I was hoping, um,

17:08.921 --> 17:10.262
you could do me a favor.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.673
Sure, yeah, name it.

17:11.707 --> 17:14.022
Well, I'm kind of responsible
for Sheldon missing Stan Lee,

17:14.057 --> 17:16.105
and I really want
to make it up to him.

17:16.138 --> 17:18.422
So I was hoping you could
give me his phone number

17:18.457 --> 17:20.101
so maybe I can arrange
for them to meet.

17:20.135 --> 17:22.384
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, I don't
have his phone number.</i>

17:22.417 --> 17:23.727
Hmm. Damn.

17:23.761 --> 17:25.102
Mm.
All right. Thank you.

17:25.137 --> 17:26.579
Mm-hmm.

17:26.614 --> 17:29.299
Wait.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.910
I have his address.

17:30.945 --> 17:32.354
Really?

17:32.388 --> 17:33.629
Great!

17:33.664 --> 17:36.751
But I can't give it to you.

17:36.786 --> 17:38.665
Then why did you tell me
you had it?

17:38.700 --> 17:41.518
I don't know.
Just chatting.

17:42.493 --> 17:43.769
You're looking at a guy

17:43.803 --> 17:45.614
who could very well
get stood up

17:45.650 --> 17:46.924
by a stray cat tonight.

17:46.959 --> 17:48.670
I'm sorry, Stuart.

17:48.705 --> 17:49.946
Thanks anyway.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.793
Mm-hmm.

17:51.828 --> 17:53.841
Wait.

17:53.876 --> 17:55.722
Yeah?

17:55.756 --> 17:57.502
Maybe we can make a deal.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.583
What kind of deal?

17:59.618 --> 18:01.564
I will give you the address

18:01.599 --> 18:04.687
if you go to my
cousin's wedding with me.

18:04.721 --> 18:06.096
You're extorting
a date out of me?

18:06.131 --> 18:07.170
I kind of have to.

18:07.205 --> 18:08.782
The cousin
who's getting married

18:08.816 --> 18:11.233
is the cousin I usually
go to weddings with.

18:11.267 --> 18:13.649
Can I bring Leonard?

18:13.683 --> 18:15.965
Sure. What the hell.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.274
Deal.

18:17.309 --> 18:19.456
We'll tell people
he's your cousin.

18:21.472 --> 18:23.921
This is Stan Lee's
front door.

18:23.956 --> 18:25.668
We were on Stan
Lee's curb,

18:25.702 --> 18:27.313
then we were on
Stan Lee's walk,

18:27.347 --> 18:28.958
and now we're
at Stan Lee's

18:28.993 --> 18:30.032
front door.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.014
Yup.

18:32.048 --> 18:34.499
Oh, Lord, you just rang
Stan Lee's doorbell.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.043
At Stan Lee's house.

18:36.078 --> 18:38.628
We're about to go in and have
milk and cookies with Stan Lee.

18:38.664 --> 18:40.778
Okay, sweetie, I don't know
if we're gonna have cookies,

18:40.812 --> 18:41.986
or he's just gonna say hi,

18:42.021 --> 18:43.866
or really what's gonna happen,
so just let me

18:43.902 --> 18:45.780
talk, and we'll... ?

18:45.814 --> 18:47.929
Yeah?

18:49.944 --> 18:51.487
Are you Stan Lee?

18:51.522 --> 18:54.240
Oh, damn.

18:54.274 --> 18:56.354
Hi. I'm Penny.
This is my friend, Sheldon.

18:56.389 --> 18:57.899
We're not friends
at the moment.

18:57.933 --> 18:59.242
Depends on
how this goes.

18:59.276 --> 19:01.122
Right, right. Anyway,

19:01.156 --> 19:03.202
Sheldon here is a huge fan
of yours, and he was supposed

19:03.238 --> 19:05.419
to meet you the other day
at the comic book store,

19:05.453 --> 19:09.583
but he kind of ended up in jail.

19:09.617 --> 19:10.858
I see. And you thought

19:10.893 --> 19:13.645
you'd just come over
to my house uninvited?

19:13.680 --> 19:15.593
<i>You said we
were invited.</i>

19:15.627 --> 19:17.305
Oh, no, no, I said
I'm inviting you

19:17.339 --> 19:19.219
to come with me
to Stan Lee's house.

19:20.664 --> 19:23.348
You know,
you fan boys are unbelievable.

19:23.383 --> 19:24.657
Do you think
you can just

19:24.692 --> 19:27.108
ring my doorbell
any time you want?

19:27.142 --> 19:29.156
I mean, why don't you
just come on in

19:29.191 --> 19:30.700
and watch the Lakers game
with me?

19:30.735 --> 19:33.621
Well, I'm not much
of a sports fan,

19:33.657 --> 19:35.838
but thank you.

19:36.879 --> 19:38.154
I'm sorry.

19:38.189 --> 19:40.169
He doesn't really
understand sarcasm.

19:40.204 --> 19:42.788
Well, I'll give him something
he'll understand.

19:42.822 --> 19:44.466
Joanie, call the police!

19:44.500 --> 19:46.413
Nice to meet you.

19:50.710 --> 19:53.228
Fantastic Four,
Daredevil,

19:53.262 --> 19:54.772
Invincible Iron Man,

19:54.808 --> 19:56.620
Happy Hogan,
Curt Connors...

19:56.654 --> 19:58.433
Would you just let it go?

19:58.467 --> 20:02.631
And worst of all,
Fin Fang Foom.

20:05.686 --> 20:07.264
Hey, where've you been?

20:07.298 --> 20:08.942
I'll tell you where I've been.

20:08.978 --> 20:12.165
You boys may have had gelato
with Stan Lee

20:12.199 --> 20:13.608
and gotten
autographed comics,

20:13.643 --> 20:15.723
but I saw the inside
of his house

20:15.757 --> 20:17.972
and got an autographed
application

20:18.007 --> 20:21.061
for a restraining order.

20:22.303 --> 20:24.049
Sweet.

20:24.486 --> 20:27.675
Plus, I get to hang out
with him again at the hearing.

20:30.425 --> 20:32.103
This is going
to look great hanging next

20:32.138 --> 20:34.185
to my restraining order
from Leonard Nimoy.
