[Scott] Last season on The Santa Clauses…

00:03.795 --> 00:05.171
[laughs] Ho ho ho!

00:05.255 --> 00:07.632
My kids don't have any magic powers.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.300
You sure about that?

00:09.384 --> 00:12.804
Your Santa ghost friends were right.
We do have powers.

00:12.887 --> 00:15.557

[Betty] The Secessus Clause states that

00:17.642 --> 00:20.437
you may step down once
you've chosen a proper successor.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.398
So, the Secessus Clause has
a successor subsection.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.358
We could keep it in the family.

00:25.442 --> 00:26.651
I'm gonna do this with my team.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.403
-You want us to go with you?
-All of us?

00:28.486 --> 00:30.739
Cal, I want you to make sure
that bag's filled with gifts.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.115
These things still work, right?

00:32.198 --> 00:34.492

00:34.576 --> 00:35.744
-[librarian] Yes.
-[Cal] Sweet.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.912

-Yeah. I-I remembered.
-What could go wrong?

08:59.956 --> 09:01.499
that I like up here to the North Pole.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.209

-No, my dear. That was magic.
-Aw.

And besides, Riley didn't seem surprised
that she was here.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.592

09:11.676 --> 09:13.386
It's fine. She won't tell anyone.

for their ability to keep secrets.

is cut out for this job, or even wants it.

He just turned 18.

09:29.318 --> 09:31.654
-He loves the real world.
-Okay, what are his options?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.781
Let's say he goes to college
to be with Riley,

09:33.864 --> 09:36.784
he gets a CPA degree, they get married,

09:36.867 --> 09:40.663
he never makes partner,
vacations twice a year, retires at 65.

09:40.746 --> 09:45.835
[stammers] Is it easier to blame Riley
than to even contemplate

09:45.918 --> 09:48.462
that maybe your son
doesn't wanna be exactly like you?

09:49.046 --> 09:51.090
I think he's destined to be Santa Claus,
that's it.

09:51.173 --> 09:54.176
Remember, if you love something,
let it go.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.345
You might as well,
because Betty is never gonna go for this.

10:01.892 --> 10:04.437
[Betty] Who does Santa Scott think
makes the decisions around here?

10:05.187 --> 10:08.691
Cal would be the worst Santa
since the last guy he tried to make Santa.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.318
This is a tough one.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.154
You're perfect. Santa's perfect.

10:13.237 --> 10:15.615
You're perfect. Santa's perfect.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.575
I don't really know what to think here.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.244
Tomorrow I'll make him think
it was my idea, so he hates it.

10:21.370 --> 10:22.622
Dinner's ready.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.999
I like my popcorn and cranberries
slightly warm.

10:25.082 --> 10:26.542
No, no, no! Don't!

10:28.169 --> 10:29.503
[Noel] What's all this?

10:30.546 --> 10:32.214
It's my time to go on Kribble Krabble.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.592
[gasps] Honeybuns, that's fantastic!

10:34.675 --> 10:38.137
A year in the real world
to experience all life has to offer.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.973
I wish I could go with you,
but you know the rules.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.600
I'm so happy for you, crumb cake.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.727
I don't have time for frivolity.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.103
They can't make me go.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.229
[knocks]

10:49.899 --> 10:51.567
We're here to make you
go on Kribble Krabble.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.737
"The Kribble Krabble Clause."

10:54.820 --> 10:57.031
"In accepting position of Head Elf,

10:57.114 --> 10:59.450
you agree to take a leave of absence
from the North Pole

10:59.533 --> 11:04.705
for education and rejuvenation purposes,
whether you wish to or not."

11:05.414 --> 11:06.749
You're way overdue.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.250
I can't go now.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.335
I'll defer.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.089
"No exceptions."

11:13.881 --> 11:15.341
I know, but in this case--

11:18.260 --> 11:19.720
"That includes you, Betty."

11:20.221 --> 11:22.348
These clauses are so specific.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.392
You know the penalty
for those who don't go.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.018
Fine.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.690
I can't believe you brought security.
Did you really think I was going to run?

11:30.773 --> 11:32.066
No. [chuckles]

11:37.655 --> 11:39.281
-[static on radio]
-I've got eyes on her.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.450
[Sandra] We've been here for hours.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.577
And he's not being unreasonable, Do--

11:44.578 --> 11:45.621
-Prettyboy.
-Okay.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.415
All he's saying is to cut back
on the peppermint

11:47.498 --> 11:50.584
'cause he has to fly behind you,
where your butt is.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.753
I feel ganged up on, Animal Girl.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.297
W-- Where did you hear that name?

11:55.381 --> 11:56.507
-I don't know.
-[Riley] Wow.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.801
[gasps] This place is so unreal.

11:58.884 --> 12:01.554
I know. And one day, it'll all be mine.

12:02.471 --> 12:04.640
You can't tell anyone,
but I'm gonna be the next Santa.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.600
[laughing] OMG.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.519
-Yeah.
-I am dating the next Santa Claus.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.354
-[laughs] My dad is gonna be so happy.
-Yeah.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.690
He's so tired of me
always bringing bikers home.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.734
-What?
-[gasps] Santa's reindeer?

12:14.817 --> 12:16.402
-No way.
-[grunts]

12:16.485 --> 12:19.780
Yeah, my sister can talk to the animals,
but I have the magic touch.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.073
-No.
-[both gasp]

12:21.157 --> 12:22.366
[screaming]

12:22.450 --> 12:24.535
-You okay, Swizzle Stick?
-[chuckles]

12:24.618 --> 12:25.870
Sorry.

12:25.953 --> 12:29.081
-It was a weird sort of spasm.
-It's oka-- It's okay.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.624
[stammers] I know you didn't mean to.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.918
That's why my dad put Sandra
in charge of the reindeer.

12:33.002 --> 12:37.006
-In charge of us? [giggles]
-[laughs] No one tells us what to do.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.674
Nice going, big mouth.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.676
-Wait, wait, h-hold on.
-[reindeer grumbling]

12:40.760 --> 12:44.430
You can actually understand them?
All I hear is super angry grunts.

12:44.513 --> 12:48.976
Well, if you're in charge,
Blitzen's been eating my grain.

12:49.059 --> 12:53.147
Well, only because Donner
has been eating my grain.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.400
Both of you are giving me a migraine.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.027
Be thankful you don't speak animal.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.821
Ever since we got back to the North Pole,
it's gotten worse.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.449
-And now I can hear all of them.
-Wait, like, all the reindeer?

13:03.532 --> 13:04.617
And their fleas!

13:04.700 --> 13:07.077
-I think they're unionizing.
-[flea] We have rights too!

13:07.161 --> 13:09.205
Believe it or not,
animals complain more than humans,

13:09.288 --> 13:10.915
which I did not think was possible.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.917
-Wow. Hurtful.
-Wow. So hurtful.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.001
-Rude.
-Very hurtful.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.961
-Tell it to the fleas!
-[reindeer grunts]

13:16.545 --> 13:20.841
[Kris] Hey, Dad.
So, uh, did you get a snow globe?

13:21.634 --> 13:25.012
I was wondering what, uh,
old Christmas memory it showed you.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.348
You know, maybe the non-believers…
[stammers]

13:27.431 --> 13:28.557
…they didn't get 'em.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.809
I didn't think of that.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.354
But it's gonna be real hard
to deny Santa after this.

13:33.437 --> 13:37.483
So, who knows?
Maybe Santapolis can rebound.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.527
The snow globes are so cool.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.570
You know
everyone is still talking about them?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.948
The magic only lasts for a week
before they shut down,

13:44.031 --> 13:46.909
but hopefully, people will carry it
in their hearts for a long time.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.118
That is so hot.

13:48.202 --> 13:51.997
Well, Riley, I hope you enjoyed your tour.
Probably not gonna remember a lot of this.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.250
Um, Dad, can we not dust Riley, please?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.335
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Oh, I'm sorry. What's dusting?

13:56.418 --> 13:57.795
It's like a memory eraser,

13:57.878 --> 14:00.339
but it's just one
of those dumb ancient rules.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.007
There's so much I can't wait to change.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.468
They just updated the manual
200 years ago.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.303
-But you know what I was thinking?
-Uh-uh.

14:06.387 --> 14:09.431
What if instead of flying,
Santa took a train?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.226
-Where would you-- But you can't-- No.
-[laughs] That is so cool.

14:12.309 --> 14:15.354
And instead of a sack,
Santa had a cool messenger bag, you know.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.356
-[Riley] Ah.
-Oh, I really wanna update the hat.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.775
-Uh…
-Uh, one of those is a really great idea.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.987
[sighs] You know why I envy Sandra?

14:23.070 --> 14:24.738
She only has to talk to critters.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.115
-Right?
-Ooh. Uh-uh. Mm-mmm.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.992
-How are the reindeer doing?
-Blah, blah, blah!

14:28.075 --> 14:30.911
Why can't everyone
just stop talking to me? Gosh, Dad!

14:32.830 --> 14:34.665
We don't yell at the North Pole, Sandra.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.709
-Carol!
-Why are you yelling?

14:36.792 --> 14:40.713
'Cause somebody, not important who,
said something Sandra didn't like.

14:40.796 --> 14:43.007
Mom, Dad wants to erase Riley's memory,

14:43.090 --> 14:45.718
but erasing someone's memory
is like erasing someone's life.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.636
-No, it's not.
-Our first kiss is in there.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.554
-Aw.
-[Riley] Aw.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.223
Wait, if we stay kissing,
then the memory can never go away.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.433
-That's not necessarily--
-[gasps]

14:52.516 --> 14:53.767
-You don't have to--
-Yeah, okay.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.020
Oh. Aw. Ew.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.897
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

14:57.980 --> 15:00.900
No dusting, and for the record,
this was my idea.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.153
Mm-hmm. [clears throat] I'm proud of you.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.655
Yeah, we'll get
the Gaslighting Department on this.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.992
They can monitor her behavior and
adjust her memory if she starts blabbing.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.661
-I did the same thing to Simon.
-Now I'm less proud.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.373
Okay. You guys, Riley's gotta go home,
and she's gotta go home now. I mean it.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.000
But she can come back, right?

15:19.543 --> 15:21.587
Maybe somebody could dust me.

but he's not Head Elf material.

I mean, he's just gonna do
everything you want him to.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.954
So, it's decided then.

18:48.293 --> 18:52.256

for you to see and do on Kribble Krabble.

I still think it's a terrible idea
to make me Head Elf.

19:15.696 --> 19:19.366
When things go wrong, I scream.
Head Elves can't scream.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.329
Santa Scott making wild decisions
on his own is very Magnus Antas.

-Uh, a p-past-- past Santa.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.969
And?

21:44.052 --> 21:46.847
A thousand years ago,
Christmas was based in Europe,

21:46.930 --> 21:49.808
but when humans started stealing
the magic for themselves,

21:49.891 --> 21:51.184
Magnus Antas moved the elves

21:51.268 --> 21:53.478
and his operation to the North Pole.
[giggles]

21:53.562 --> 21:55.939
Wait a minute. I was in the Yule-Verse,
and I met all the Santas.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.692
I never met one
with a great name like that.

21:58.775 --> 22:01.278
Magnus Antas.
That's almost like a superhero Santa.

22:01.361 --> 22:04.406
'Cause you could just shorten it
into Mega Santa.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.908
Look at my power! I'm Mega Santa.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.536
I don't bring the gifts.
I throw them at the children.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.122
-[laughs] Spot on, Santa.
-[Scott] Ho ho ho.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.458
You know,
I don't know enough about Santa lore.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.377
We gotta make North Pole history
part of Cal's training.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.046
-All right? This is good stuff.
-Yeah.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.048
-See you guys.
-[Noel] We can do that. [chuckles]

22:21.131 --> 22:22.382
[groans] This is bad.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.760
If Santa hears the truth
about Magnus Antas,

22:24.843 --> 22:26.887
he'll never trust any elf ever again.

22:26.970 --> 22:31.433
He might even get rid of us.
The one thing we can't do is panic.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.644
Noel, it's against the rules
to destroy official records.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.772
I know. I shouldn't have this job.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.065
[groans]

22:38.148 --> 22:41.610
We have to hide all evidence of
the last years of the Magnus Antas reign.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.570
-When he became…
-[sighs]

22:43.653 --> 22:44.780
The Mad Santa.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.366
What did I ever do to you?

22:47.449 --> 22:49.951
Was it the torture? The bedlam?

22:50.535 --> 22:54.581
Me threatening to turn
the world's children into nutcrackers?

22:54.664 --> 22:58.210
I admit it, yes.
Sometimes I can go a little--

22:58.293 --> 22:59.503
I can go a little far.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.257
But is it a crime to be a little moody?

23:04.841 --> 23:09.513
Remember you all said
I was the best Santa Claus ever.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.725
You said it.
It was a while ago, but you said it.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.853
Fine.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.648
Fine. But make it your best shot.

you better hope it's everlasting.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.715

23:45.799 --> 23:49.136
Uh, just some old artifact. It's weird.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.347
Betty had a report
on missing North Pole artifacts.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.183
Oh, this might be our first case.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.144
It sounds unsolvable.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.064
-Let's go.
-I don't know where she's going.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.942
Hey, this was the Mad Santa nutcracker.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.319
You know what happens
if it gets into the wrong hands.

24:06.403 --> 24:10.407
It only works if it comes in contact
with North Pole magic.

24:10.490 --> 24:12.117
What are you so scared of?

24:13.869 --> 24:15.495
[Kris] Dad. Please don't use that to--

24:15.579 --> 24:16.746
-Crack nuts?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.331
It's a nutcracker.

like everything else in this museum.

and Cal is sad that Riley isn't here.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.605

26:05.689 --> 26:07.482
It's getting in the way
of his training, honey.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.361
Okay. Here's my advice
on the whole Cal/Riley situation.

26:11.444 --> 26:13.530
Just let it go.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.908
You know what's the worst thing
you can give a child?

-[sighs] Expired pudding?
-It's not as bad as you think it is.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.082
It's a little tang to it,
actually makes it more interesting.

26:24.165 --> 26:26.876
No, worst thing you can give a kid
is a balloon.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.754
You know, 'cause kids like the balloon,
they wanna see it fly.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.465
So, they let it go.
The balloon doesn't come back.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.427
You got a screaming kid
and a stressed-out parent

26:35.510 --> 26:37.304
because they let it go.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.308
I'm not really sure if you're the kid
or the parent in this story,

26:41.391 --> 26:43.310
but I'm pretty clear
that Cal is the balloon.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.562
I don't wanna lose Cal.

a normal relationship, like--

-If I could, it'd still be a no. [grunts]
-Well, you know what?

I-I think I speak for the whole world
when I say thank you.
