00:12.912 --> 00:17.315
Tonight, Audi's dynamic ride control
tested to the limit in the Alps.

00:17.851 --> 00:21.844
Variable torque split transmissions
given a workout on our track.

00:22.489 --> 00:27.017
And Merc's 190mph Black
on the edge in Wales.

00:32.332 --> 00:35.665
Thank you, thank you.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.838
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:40.940 --> 00:44.774
Hello, and yes,
tonight and for one night only,

00:44.844 --> 00:48.575
we've accidentally made a show
all about cars.

00:48.648 --> 00:53.745
Yeah, for the whole show, not one of us
falls over or catches fire or anything.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.153
No. That said, later on
we are gonna do the Cool Wall.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.282
It's back.

00:59.359 --> 01:03.921
It's back, but...
but we're kicking off with these two.

01:03.997 --> 01:08.991
See, in the not too distant past,
you had a very simple choice

01:09.069 --> 01:13.699
if you wanted a fast four-seater rally car
for the road.

01:13.773 --> 01:18.506
Yeah, for one lap of the NÃ¼rburgring,
you wanted the super-sharp Mitsubishi Evo.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.911
For the journey home, you wanted
the more comfortable Subaru Impreza.

01:21.981 --> 01:26.315
Anyway, there are now new versions
of both these cars.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.018
Let's try the Subaru first.

01:33.193 --> 01:36.890
Right, so it's got a gear lever
and a steering wheel and a key,

01:36.963 --> 01:38.487
so it all seems very normal...

01:39.666 --> 01:45.298
...but it isn't. Because, before I set off, I have
to choose how much traction control I'd like.

01:45.371 --> 01:48.829
That means going into
the vehicle dynamics control system.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.034
When you've done that,

01:50.110 --> 01:54.046
you have to choose where you want
the power from the engine to go -

01:54.114 --> 01:56.275
front wheels or back wheels.

01:57.917 --> 01:59.441
You can have it in auto,

01:59.519 --> 02:04.081
or, you can put it into manual -
six settings for this.

02:04.157 --> 02:05.852
When you've done all that,

02:05.925 --> 02:09.360
you have to choose
what kind of throttle response you'd like.

02:11.998 --> 02:16.992
Sort of quite sporty, in sport,
very sporty in sport sharp,

02:17.070 --> 02:21.530
or intelligent. This is more complicated
than my daughter's mobile phone.

02:21.608 --> 02:25.442
Honestly, I am surprised you don't drive it
with one of these.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.040
But you don't.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.551
This car isn't an anorak.

02:33.620 --> 02:38.023
It's where people who make anoraks go
to buy their anoraks.

02:40.793 --> 02:45.890
And life isn't much better
in the new Mitsubishi Evo 10.

02:47.834 --> 02:52.066
I have even had to resort to the handbook.
Here it is.

02:52.138 --> 02:55.130
Because there's a button here
that says ASC Off.

02:55.208 --> 02:59.440
Now, chapter four, verse 56.

02:59.512 --> 03:03.915
And lo, "an operation noise may be emitted
from the engine compartment

03:03.983 --> 03:05.644
"in the following situations -

03:05.718 --> 03:09.484
"the sound is associated with
checking the operations of the ASC.

03:09.556 --> 03:12.320
"At this time you may feel a shock..."

03:16.963 --> 03:21.229
"...driving force and steering performance
as the vehicle turns...

03:21.301 --> 03:24.065
"...while pressing the acceleration pedal."

03:24.137 --> 03:26.128
Who writes this?

03:27.073 --> 03:30.008
If you push this one... I don't understand.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.737
Oh, no, wait - no, no, look.

03:31.811 --> 03:33.972
Now I see!

03:35.114 --> 03:41.519
This is to tell it whether we're driving
on Tarmac or gravel or snow.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.590
So, both these cars are complicated,

03:46.659 --> 03:48.092
both are Japanese,

03:48.161 --> 03:49.788
both have four seats,

03:49.862 --> 03:51.830
both have turbos,

03:51.898 --> 03:54.560
both have four-wheel drive,

03:54.634 --> 03:57.831
both were born in the world of rallying,

03:57.904 --> 04:01.271
both will get from naught to 60
in under five seconds,

04:01.341 --> 04:05.243
and both have a top speed of 155.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.941
So, to try and split them up a bit,

04:10.016 --> 04:15.352
I've devised a simple test involving
a small group of rally enthusiasts.

04:16.389 --> 04:19.950
So what I'm gonna do is see how close
I can get to them in each of the cars,

04:20.026 --> 04:24.087
flat out,
without mowing any of them down.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.763
0K, Mitsubishi first.

04:28.368 --> 04:31.667
I've had a 14-year-old
set up all the computers for me...

04:34.040 --> 04:36.270
...so let's see what's what.

04:43.283 --> 04:47.117
0n the very first attempt,
I came within half an inch

04:47.186 --> 04:51.384
and that put a huge smile
on the rally fans' faces.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.949
So now, here comes the Subaru.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.689
Here we go.

05:03.202 --> 05:07.036
00h, sadly the teenager
had set the car up all wrong,

05:07.106 --> 05:11.008
and it had under-steered wide.
The spectators were livid.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.137
I therefore decided to have another go.

05:16.382 --> 05:19.146
Turn in, no power on,
the back'll come round. Yup.

05:23.556 --> 05:25.956
That's the face of a man
who's lost his Bovril.

05:26.025 --> 05:29.654
So, to cheer him up,
I had one last attempt.

05:29.729 --> 05:31.356
Turn in, no power.

05:33.599 --> 05:37.660
This went so badly,
it's not really suitable for family viewing.

05:38.471 --> 05:42.703
In the olden days it was very close
between the Evo and the Impreza -

05:42.775 --> 05:45.073
it was like Chelsea and Manchester United,

05:45.144 --> 05:49.945
but... but, now, with these new models,
it's like Chelsea and...

05:51.517 --> 05:54.486
I don't know enough about football.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.250
What team plays in red
that isn't as good as Chelsea?

05:57.323 --> 06:00.121
- Nottingham Forest.
- Nottingham Forest.

06:04.397 --> 06:09.232
And it's not just my close-quarters rally test
either, where the Subaru falls down.

06:09.302 --> 06:12.829
Let's be honest, shall we?
It is uglier than a war wound.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.507
It's far too soft and wallowy.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.448
It sounds...

06:26.986 --> 06:29.318
...like it's running on Mogadon.

06:32.959 --> 06:37.225
The only reason they can sell it for L25,000
is because it has fewer luxuries than...

06:38.331 --> 06:40.526
I dunno, an Egyptian's lavatory.

06:47.340 --> 06:50.969
So, let's concentrate on the Mitsubishi.

06:54.714 --> 06:57.547
This is not an Egyptian's khazi.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.950
Its TV screen is a satnav.

07:03.022 --> 07:08.517
It's a graph showing your average speed and
fuel consumption over the last two hours.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.992
But don't think this car
is aimed at an audience

07:12.064 --> 07:14.498
which isn't old enough to drive yet.

07:22.241 --> 07:26.041
It will, quite literally,
run rings round the Subaru.

07:26.112 --> 07:31.277
It's so much sharper, so much more focused.
Better-looking as well.

07:34.020 --> 07:39.014
And the engine in this FQ360 model
is such a tower of power,

07:39.091 --> 07:42.686
it can keep all four wheels spinning endlessly.

07:52.538 --> 07:58.340
I know the entry speed for this corner
in a Ferrari or a Lamborghini is 65.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.311
I've just gone in at 100.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.011
It's just so easy.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.515
It is genuinely incredible,
and I do mean that.

08:13.593 --> 08:16.061
There is no car that handles like this one.

08:17.797 --> 08:21.164
Even if you have a crash,
it'll still keep going.

08:23.803 --> 08:26.670
I thought it would be impossible
to make a four-door saloon

08:26.739 --> 08:29.572
more exciting than the old Evo 9,

08:29.642 --> 08:32.975
but with the 10... they have.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.981
- James May never exploded. Didn't get lost.
- That's what matters.

08:41.053 --> 08:44.147
- Just cars.
- Just two cars.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.288
- So?
- Yeah.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.225
This is the one to buy.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.856
Oh, no! You'd have to be drunk and mad
to buy this.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.924
- Oh, God!
- No, seriously, OK, it's brilliant on the track.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.766
Unlike old Evos,
it's also quite comfortable on the road,

08:58.838 --> 09:01.329
and you don't have to service it
every 700 yards,

09:01.407 --> 09:05.343
but, instead of a fuel tank,
they've fitted a pipette.

09:05.411 --> 09:07.379
I've actually worked this out -

09:07.446 --> 09:11.610
that if you drive flat out,
you'll empty the tank in 48 miles.

09:11.684 --> 09:14.949
- Ah.
- So, what I'd do is buy this one,

09:15.021 --> 09:17.251
which is the less powerful version.

09:17.323 --> 09:19.518
- Sorry, less powerful?
- Less powerful.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.787
Is there a doctor in here?

09:21.861 --> 09:26.059
Bear with me, OK? This has got
300 horsepower, rather than 360,

09:26.132 --> 09:30.091
so you go further on a tank. OK?
It's got a six speed gearbox, not five.

09:30.169 --> 09:32.694
It looks exactly the same,
has the same top speed,

09:32.772 --> 09:34.933
- handles exactly the same...
- Yeah, but...

09:35.007 --> 09:38.568
No, and, this is L6,000 less than that.

09:38.644 --> 09:42.637
Yeah, but the Subaru
is L7,000 less than that.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.910
There's lots of things cheaper than that.

09:44.984 --> 09:48.010
Would you like to have keyhole surgery
on your scrotum?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.351
That's very cheap. Do you want that?

09:50.423 --> 09:52.789
- No!
- There you are, I've won the argument.

09:52.858 --> 09:56.851
Now we must find out
which is the fastest round our track.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.830
If it's the Subaru,
you're gonna look like such a knob now.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.161
I am a bit nervous about that,
but nevertheless,

10:04.236 --> 10:06.636
we shall now hand them over
to our tame racing driver.

10:06.706 --> 10:12.144
Some say that each of his toenails
are exactly the same as a woman's nipples...

10:13.946 --> 10:18.383
...and that he thinks the credit crunch
is some kind of breakfast cereal.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.012
All we know is, he's called the Stig.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.856
Subaru first, and he's off.

10:24.924 --> 10:29.054
No, wait, he's still setting it up.
Bear with him.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.119
There he goes, start the clockl

10:31.197 --> 10:34.894
0K, I suspect the Stig will have it set
with most of the power going to the back,

10:34.967 --> 10:36.901
so, basically, it's a Mark II Escort.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.737
Yeah, you see, the back's stepping out slightly
there, into the first corner.

10:41.807 --> 10:45.174
That will undoubtedly arouse the rally fans.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.907
00h, Stig seems to have got into
Elton John. Not literally, obviously.

10:50.216 --> 10:53.310
Chicago. Neat, not that quick.

10:53.386 --> 10:57.117
The Impreza's a hatchback, you'll note,
rather than a saloon, for the first time.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.384
Still looks like
a butchered bull terrier though.

10:59.458 --> 11:03.360
There's a fair bit of understeer through there
and tire squeal - that's not good.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.421
#...Daniel waving goodbye... #

11:06.499 --> 11:11.732
0K, follow-through, a chance
to really stretch that 2.5 liter Boxer engine.

11:11.804 --> 11:14.568
Brisk through the tire wall.
Two corners left.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.042
He's getting a bit sideways there.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.476
And now, he's coming up to Gambon.

11:20.546 --> 11:25.006
More sideways stuff, just like
a 1970s rally car and across the line.

11:25.084 --> 11:26.449
Now, the Evo.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.612
What's he doing?

11:28.688 --> 11:30.485
0h, he's readyl

11:30.556 --> 11:31.887
And he's off, there we go.

11:31.957 --> 11:34.551
Now, for fairness,
we're using the less powerful model.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.926
Has the same 300 horsepowers
as the Subaru.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.397
0bviously, of course, the Evo's better,
as I've said.

11:40.466 --> 11:43.264
Through the first corner,
taking it quite wide,

11:43.335 --> 11:45.166
but it is looking good.

11:45.237 --> 11:50.470
And of course, unlike the Impreza,
this doesn't resemble a smashed buttock.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.840
Chicago was very neat.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.379
Hammerhead.
Subaru wasn't very good here.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.778
Can the Evo do better?

11:55.848 --> 11:58.009
He's bang on the lines.

11:58.084 --> 12:03.420
That is stunning. Tidier, on the correct line,
little drift toward the exit.

12:03.489 --> 12:07.118
0K, he's really cracking
that two liter turbocharged engine.

12:07.193 --> 12:08.820
Now through the follow-through.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.260
Come on, Stig, quickerl Hurry up.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.661
Second to last corner.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.133
Stig's hands all over the wheel
like a crazed Japanese robot.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.500
Through Gambon, four-wheel drift,

12:18.571 --> 12:20.004
and across the linel

12:21.440 --> 12:22.566
So?

12:24.210 --> 12:25.700
- Well, come on.
- Got the times here.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.006
Yeah.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.745
Subaru -

12:29.815 --> 12:32.613
1:28.2.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.347
So, that goes there.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.389
See, look, quicker than the Evo VIII.

12:37.456 --> 12:38.787
Yeah, good, good.

12:38.858 --> 12:42.294
So, how much quicker or otherwise
is the Evo?

12:42.361 --> 12:44.625
Oh, no, it's all smudged!

12:44.697 --> 12:47.689
- You did that.
- No, I didn't. I can't read it.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.496
- You smudged it.
- I think what it says...

12:49.568 --> 12:52.833
Yes, 1:17.1, ladies and gentlemen!

12:52.905 --> 12:54.873
- No, it didn't!
- Yes, it did.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.807
What did it say?

12:57.877 --> 12:59.742
- 1:20...
- Eight.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.803
- Two.
- 1:28.22?

13:01.881 --> 13:03.348
- 1:28.22?
- Yeah.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.713
It's slower than the Subaru!
The Subaru's faster.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.514
- It isn't.
- No, it is.

13:07.586 --> 13:08.985
- It isn't.
- It is.

13:09.054 --> 13:11.022
It isn't! Stop saying this!

13:11.090 --> 13:12.921
You're wrong. No, it isn't.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.557
Right, let's do the news.

13:15.628 --> 13:19.394
Round where I live there's a new system
for paying for your parking,

13:19.465 --> 13:20.591
using your mobile phone,

13:20.666 --> 13:23.430
but the difference is,
it responds to voice commands,

13:23.502 --> 13:26.369
and the really amazing thing is, it works,

13:26.438 --> 13:33.002
until you get to the bit that says
"In one word, describe the color of your car."

13:33.078 --> 13:35.911
- In one word?
- Yeah.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.006
Everyone would go "Erm"
and then it'd be Erm.

13:38.083 --> 13:45.114
Exactly. I paid for 20 minutes parking
in a fiat Panda 1.2 Eleganza in Erm...

13:46.358 --> 13:48.849
You've gotta describe the color
in one word.

13:48.928 --> 13:52.125
So, if they asked me... "Lovely."

13:52.198 --> 13:55.565
Now, anyone see Dr. Who
a couple of weeks ago?

13:55.634 --> 13:57.431
Yeah.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.768
Stig's been moonlighting.
We've got a clip of it here.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.330
Check it out.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.110
It's worrying.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.979
The thing is, though,
he is such a professional.

14:12.051 --> 14:16.579
He realized there was gonna be a shot where
you'd be able to see through his visor,

14:16.655 --> 14:21.683
so, rather than reveal his identity,
he tore his own face off.

14:23.963 --> 14:26.261
It was quite disturbing to watch,
but, dedication.

14:26.332 --> 14:30.496
Yeah.
Now, good news, Jaguar has found a pound,

14:30.569 --> 14:36.530
and has decided to spend it tarting up the XK.
This is it, the XKRS.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.510
It's essentially the same,
just with different suspension,

14:39.578 --> 14:42.046
and, it's got a Bluetooth system in it, OK?

14:42.114 --> 14:46.676
Now, have you ever connected
anything up using Bluetooth?

14:46.752 --> 14:48.811
- No.
- Has anyone managed to?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.015
- Yes.
- It's easy.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.250
It is not easy!

14:52.324 --> 14:57.626
You're driving it along and it says, "Do you
want to dock your phone to the dashboard?"

14:57.696 --> 15:01.097
It says "Enter the pin code 1547"

15:01.166 --> 15:03.157
So you put in 1547,
it says "No, that's wrong."

15:03.235 --> 15:06.295
Technically, in that Jag it says,
"Do you want to mate your phone?"

15:06.372 --> 15:09.273
- It does.
- If you're trying to encourage them to mate,

15:09.341 --> 15:12.674
I think a box of chocolates and some nice music
would work better than a pin code.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.908
No, it is, it's just impossible,
absolutely impossible.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.779
So, you're encouraging your phone
to have sex with the dash.

15:18.851 --> 15:22.412
What is it they do to encourage farm animals
to mate? Cos they do, don't they?

15:22.488 --> 15:26.356
They do. You have to wait for the lady cow
to be on heat.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.892
Then you put the bull in there.

15:27.960 --> 15:31.760
You can't wait for your dashboard to have
a period before you make a phone call.

15:31.830 --> 15:36.028
How can you possibly know when
your dashboard's having its period?

15:36.101 --> 15:39.036
Because the satnav would lose its temper
for no reason.

15:39.104 --> 15:43.006
I said left!

15:44.977 --> 15:47.445
Applause, sonny. That's what it is.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.345
I think you'll find after a few years,

15:51.417 --> 15:54.181
your dashboard
had been faking all its connections.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.380
"I was putting it on!"

15:56.455 --> 15:58.946
With your best mate's mobile phone.

15:59.024 --> 16:02.892
Good news - the Vauxhall Vectra is dead.
It's gone.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.658
Here is the replacement.
It's called the Insignia.

16:05.731 --> 16:09.758
You've gotta say straightaway,
that is a good-looking car.

16:09.835 --> 16:12.565
There's no arguing with that.
Have you seen the new Ford Fiesta?

16:12.638 --> 16:15.539
- Yeah.
- Look at this, everyone.

16:15.607 --> 16:16.733
That's unbelievably good.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.369
That's terrific.
Am I right in saying, do you think,

16:19.445 --> 16:22.243
that the good-looking cars these days
are the mainstream ones?

16:22.314 --> 16:26.410
Have you seen, for example,
that Renault Laguna CoupÃ©?

16:26.485 --> 16:31.013
- Or the CitroÃ«n C5, have you seen that?
- Is that the Sat CC, the coupÃ© version?

16:31.090 --> 16:32.352
I know, they are.

16:32.424 --> 16:33.948
- Bad news!
- What?

16:34.026 --> 16:36.586
The Dacia Sandero, it's delayed.

16:36.662 --> 16:37.720
Oh, no!

16:37.796 --> 16:43.860
Anyway, last week we introduced a campaign
to rid Britain of its signposts

16:43.936 --> 16:47.235
and it seems to have struck a bit
of a chord with the country.

16:47.306 --> 16:50.935
Been sent loads and loads of stupid signs
that need taking down.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.705
One of my favorites is this one.

16:52.778 --> 16:57.715
Now, quite apart from the fact
the sign cost 500 quid,

16:57.783 --> 17:01.879
how long was the meeting and involving
how many people and how many biscuits,

17:01.954 --> 17:05.481
before they said, "No, we can't put ten miles,
people will think we're making it up"?

17:05.557 --> 17:09.653
So, what, after 11 miles,
are the squirrels just gray again?

17:09.728 --> 17:11.992
It's very precise, isn't it?

17:12.064 --> 17:14.328
What if one day,
you got a really brave red squirrel,

17:14.400 --> 17:17.130
that said "I'm gonna go to the 12!"

17:17.202 --> 17:18.931
Or, he was reaching over for a nut.

17:19.003 --> 17:21.700
Can I show you another really stupid sign -
look at this one.

17:21.773 --> 17:25.938
Now, I live in the countryside and I know...

17:26.545 --> 17:28.342
...squirrels don't have antlers.

17:28.414 --> 17:31.406
I have been tossed by a squirrel like that.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.644
I'm sorry?

17:33.719 --> 17:36.244
I mean head-butted.
Not tossed.

17:38.023 --> 17:41.720
I wouldn't be surprised if one of your clubs
offered squirrel tossing.

17:41.794 --> 17:46.993
Anyway, look, I went on the internet
this week and I found this.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.400
I also found this.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.770
What that should say is
"Lane closed

17:59.845 --> 18:03.906
"so that we can impose a preposterously low
speed limit on the lane that isn't closed,

18:03.982 --> 18:07.543
"and then put average speed cameras up
so we can catch you speeding and fine you

18:07.619 --> 18:11.316
"and spend the money on signs
with squirrels on them with antlers."

18:11.390 --> 18:13.358
That's what that should say.

18:14.126 --> 18:18.927
Right, moving on. Until recently,
if you wanted a very, very fast estate car,

18:18.997 --> 18:23.730
well, you had two choices -
BMW M5 or Mercedes E63 -

18:23.802 --> 18:27.033
a difficult decision, and it just got harder,

18:27.106 --> 18:30.405
because there is now a third way,
from Audi.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.996
This is what they've come up with.

18:59.204 --> 19:01.001
The new RS6.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.743
And straightaway,
there's a problem with it.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.574
Take this boot space -

19:08.647 --> 19:13.710
at 1,660 liters,
it's a lot less than the Mercedes,

19:13.785 --> 19:17.983
and the BMW
has seven speeds in its gearbox.

19:18.056 --> 19:20.547
This has to make do with a miserable six.

19:22.461 --> 19:25.988
Still, the RS6
does have some feathers in its cap.

19:31.803 --> 19:36.137
You see, the Merc and the BMW
have around 500 horsepower apiece.

19:37.209 --> 19:38.506
This has more.

19:38.577 --> 19:41.478
572 horsepower.

19:42.314 --> 19:43.906
5-7-2.

19:45.350 --> 19:50.287
This is an estate car with more power
than a Ferrari F430.

19:51.723 --> 19:54.817
It's got more power than a Ferrari F50,
for crying out loud!

19:59.798 --> 20:04.667
What you have here then,
is the most powerful estate car in the world.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.041
Naught to 60 takes 4.6 seconds.

20:14.146 --> 20:17.582
Top speed is limited to 155 miles an hour.

20:18.784 --> 20:20.809
But on the unlimited autobahn,

20:20.886 --> 20:25.789
Audi test pilots have had more than
200mph out of this thing.

20:27.926 --> 20:30.360
Hardly surprising when you see the engine.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.497
It's an enormous five liter V10,

20:34.566 --> 20:37.865
which is boosted by two turbochargers.

20:45.143 --> 20:49.170
The whole car is awash with evidence
it means business.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.479
The Gene Hunt wheel arches,
the angry grilles,

20:52.551 --> 20:53.950
the rally car pedals,

20:54.019 --> 20:57.750
the very un-estate-like Recaro seats,

20:57.823 --> 21:00.451
and finally, the ceramic brakes.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.696
They cost six grand, which is a bit painful,

21:04.763 --> 21:07.391
but then the whole car isn't exactly a bargain.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.663
It costs L77,000.

21:10.736 --> 21:14.934
Almost ten grand more than the Mercedes
or the BMW M5.

21:16.575 --> 21:19.510
Now, as Jeremy found out in the last series,

21:19.578 --> 21:22.376
those cars are both pretty special to drive,

21:22.447 --> 21:26.178
so how does this big missile stack up?

21:28.353 --> 21:33.848
Well, that's why we're in the skiing town
of Les Arcs in the French alps to find out.

21:36.995 --> 21:39.930
I'm gonna drive from here, which is here,

21:39.998 --> 21:43.695
and then drive down the mountain, a very
winding road all the way down here -

21:43.769 --> 21:47.068
down, down, down and then along
and up a little bit at the end,

21:47.139 --> 21:49.164
to get to Le Bar FermÃ© at Villaroger.

21:49.241 --> 21:52.938
And predictably,
there's an improbable race involved.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.911
Against these two.

21:56.315 --> 22:01.252
They are Antoine Montant and Francois Bon,
two top level skiers,

22:01.320 --> 22:05.950
who are also capable of seducing
up to seven chalet girls at any one time.

22:07.426 --> 22:11.726
I'm not a petty man,
but I sort of dislike them already.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.197
Anyway, while I'm driving
all the way down the mountain,

22:14.266 --> 22:18.794
they shall attempt to beat me by taking
a more direct and dangerous route.

22:18.870 --> 22:22.033
That means taking a ski lift
and climbing to the top of the mountain,

22:22.107 --> 22:26.703
and then sort of skiing straight down
to finish at the bar.

22:26.778 --> 22:28.746
With a bit of luck, they'll both crash,

22:28.814 --> 22:32.978
and several hundred chalet maids will return
to England with their honor preserved.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.487
Before the off, we discussed tactics.

22:36.555 --> 22:40.184
Their English was poor,
but luckily, I speak French.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.110
- OK.
- OK!

23:01.179 --> 23:02.578
OK!

23:07.052 --> 23:08.679
Right, this is it.

23:08.754 --> 23:12.155
Into the car's computer -
a lot easier to use than the BMW's.

23:12.224 --> 23:17.127
I've got three options for the ride settings -
sport, dynamic or James May.

23:17.195 --> 23:19.720
I think today, sport.

23:19.798 --> 23:21.663
- OK, chaps, you ready?
- Yeah.

23:23.602 --> 23:26.298
Here we go, three, two, one, go!

23:28.039 --> 23:33.534
Now, it's 22 miles to Villaroger and
Le Bar FermÃ©, which is our finishing line.

23:35.247 --> 23:37.977
But this race
isn't just Top Gear tomfoolery.

23:39.551 --> 23:43.248
This route has a lot of bends,
twists, turns and straights,

23:43.321 --> 23:47.018
so it should give us the opportunity
to see if it's got what it takes.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.960
Come on, big fella,
let's see what you've got.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.588
Back up the mountain,

23:53.665 --> 23:57.863
the skiers were in the first of three lifts
it would take to get them to the top.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.739
The thrust of this thing!

24:03.008 --> 24:04.737
Concentrate, Hammond, concentrate.

24:04.810 --> 24:08.007
One patch of ice
and I'll be falling for weeks.

24:10.482 --> 24:14.851
One thing I have to remember
hurtling down this hill - this is a heavy car.

24:17.222 --> 24:21.784
It's 145kg heavier
than the BMW M5 estate.

24:21.860 --> 24:25.455
That's like driving around with Chris Moyles
permanently in the boot.

24:26.531 --> 24:30.627
With this much power and this much mass,
on this sort of road,

24:30.702 --> 24:34.365
the four-wheel-drive system
is working overtime.

24:34.439 --> 24:37.602
But then, in the RS6, it does have help.

24:37.676 --> 24:41.305
Nerd moment -
it's got a very sophisticated suspension.

24:41.379 --> 24:44.405
When a car goes into a bend,
say a right-hander,

24:44.483 --> 24:46.041
it starts to lean to the left.

24:46.117 --> 24:50.679
They've pumped more oil into the shocks on
that side to prop it up and stop it doing that.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.789
Hairpin!

24:56.094 --> 24:57.459
Yes, it can handle it.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.157
Six miles down.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.221
Where are they?

25:01.299 --> 25:04.928
They were still climbing in the cable car.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.470
Leaning on the brakes, again, again, again!

25:11.543 --> 25:13.704
I think six grand is cheap.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.640
I'd pay a lot more.

25:17.849 --> 25:20.716
The finish line was now 12 miles away.

25:20.785 --> 25:25.017
Up on the mountain, the two skiers
were in their final cable car.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.990
Only the tiniest window to get past.
That might be it.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.061
Wow!

25:39.271 --> 25:41.466
Ten miles to go, ten miles. Come on!

25:41.540 --> 25:44.839
If they're still going uphill, they've had it.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.271
In fact, they were still climbing,

25:48.346 --> 25:50.974
even though they'd now run out of ski lifts...

25:53.084 --> 25:58.351
...because these guys had no intention
of using normal ski runs.

26:05.297 --> 26:06.321
Listen to that!

26:06.398 --> 26:10.027
With just five miles of driving left...

26:12.504 --> 26:15.302
...the skiers were now at 11,000ft...

26:15.373 --> 26:17.170
Come on!

26:17.242 --> 26:20.336
...and ready to come down the fast way.

26:42.167 --> 26:44.294
30kph limit. 30.

26:44.369 --> 26:45.859
Fair enough, it's a town.

27:00.418 --> 27:03.251
Get on with it!
Turn left, for God's sake!

27:25.977 --> 27:31.916
The skiers had plummeted 6,000ft
in the time it had taken me to do two miles.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.247
It was getting close.

27:37.689 --> 27:40.681
It's a left, I'm going uphill.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.319
This is where I have all of the advantages.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.792
572 of them, in fact.

27:51.903 --> 27:55.999
Then, with the village in sight,
the skiers hit some global warming.

27:59.911 --> 28:04.314
I was moments away
but the skiers weren't beaten yet.

28:10.321 --> 28:11.913
Go, go, go!

28:16.261 --> 28:18.456
Where do I go?
Where do I go?

28:22.167 --> 28:25.694
The bar was hidden
in a mass of narrow streets.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.772
Oh, God, I'm lost.

28:32.844 --> 28:35.506
Not now, please not now.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.445
Any channels, this is Hammond,
where are you?

28:43.421 --> 28:45.252
Le Bar, which way?

28:53.631 --> 28:55.599
Oh, bugger!

28:55.667 --> 28:59.831
Well done! Good. Been here long?

28:59.904 --> 29:03.203
Now, go to a bar
and pursue some of our English women.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.448
All right...

29:14.385 --> 29:18.014
...which is best, the Audi,
the Mercedes or the BMW?

29:18.089 --> 29:20.182
James, in your world,
I'm guessing none.

29:20.258 --> 29:24.888
On Planet Earth, if what you really want
is a bonkers estate car,

29:24.963 --> 29:27.761
it's the most bonkers of them all,
you have to have the Audi.

29:27.832 --> 29:30.164
Well, you say that, but you just lost that race.

29:30.235 --> 29:31.998
That was only cos I got lost at the end.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.267
If I'd bothered to find out where the bar is
before I set off, I'd have won.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.706
So, thanks to your incompetence, frankly,

29:37.776 --> 29:42.145
we have to conclude that if you want
a powerful German estate car,

29:42.213 --> 29:44.875
- buy two small Frenchmen.
- Yes.

29:46.684 --> 29:51.280
Right, it's time now to put some stars
in our reasonably priced car.

29:51.356 --> 29:55.588
My guests tonight played
government agents in the hit series Spooks.

29:55.660 --> 29:58.220
Not a very realistic program,
if I'm honest,

29:58.296 --> 30:01.288
cos none of the spies
have ever left a laptop on a train,

30:01.366 --> 30:06.303
and they've never lost an entire town
full of illegal immigrants.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.704
Still, I am a huge fan,
so I'm delighted, please, to welcome

30:09.774 --> 30:12.766
Rupert Penry-Jones and Peter Firth!

30:16.881 --> 30:19.349
I see you got dressed up.

30:19.417 --> 30:21.544
You, on the other hand...

30:21.619 --> 30:23.450
Have a seat, gentlemen.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.821
So, have we enjoyed ourselves today?

30:27.892 --> 30:29.018
- So far.
- Absolutely.

30:29.093 --> 30:31.254
- Was the Stig nice to you?
- We're both knackered.

30:31.329 --> 30:33.729
It's very hard,
you have to concentrate for so long.

30:33.798 --> 30:36.266
We're not used to that -
normally it's a few seconds.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.131
A minute and 50 seconds.

30:38.203 --> 30:41.934
We've got attention spans of about
seven seconds, so it's a bit of a stretch.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.439
- What, as actors?
- Yeah.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.739
It didn't go well in your practices,
did it, if we're honest, Rupert?

30:46.811 --> 30:48.836
Some went well and some didn't go so well.

30:48.913 --> 30:51.313
Who'd like to see Rupert trying to practice?

30:51.382 --> 30:52.542
Yes!

30:52.617 --> 30:56.644
Let's just have a look. Here we go.
This is, I think, lap number three.

30:56.721 --> 30:59.815
Second to last corner, inevitably,
and, oh, dear!

31:00.859 --> 31:03.384
Oh!

31:03.461 --> 31:06.123
Would you like to see
what the car looked like after that?

31:09.234 --> 31:10.963
I had to get out of the passenger window.

31:11.035 --> 31:15.131
I'm not bothered where you had to get out of it,
you broke our precious Lacetti.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.107
That's what you're supposed to do, isn't it?
It's entertaining.

31:18.176 --> 31:21.612
It is entertaining. Well done, well crashed.
We enjoyed that.

31:21.679 --> 31:24.113
Now, can we just talk about Spooks,
do you mind?

31:24.182 --> 31:26.514
It really is a fantastic series.

31:26.584 --> 31:29.348
I'm completely hooked.
One of the things I really like about it

31:29.420 --> 31:33.083
is that there's no guarantee
when you sign up,

31:33.157 --> 31:35.216
that you're gonna be in there for a long time.

31:35.293 --> 31:37.693
It's a great dramatic device to kill heroes.

31:37.762 --> 31:42.597
It doesn't happen in television and Spooks
is the only show that does it regularly.

31:42.667 --> 31:46.433
Every time he asks for more money
or five-day weeks,

31:46.504 --> 31:49.064
they start giving him scenes
where he might die.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.005
Putting the silencer
on the end of the gun.

31:51.075 --> 31:54.010
I nearly died about six times
in the last series.

31:54.078 --> 31:57.138
And there's always a mole, isn't there?
There's always a spy.

31:57.215 --> 32:00.309
Why don't you ever notice that?

32:00.385 --> 32:02.353
- When's it coming back?
- End of September.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.878
Because presumably each of the episodes
is gonna be a lot longer this time,

32:05.957 --> 32:08.016
now you've got 42 days
to question everybody.

32:10.461 --> 32:12.452
OK, let's talk about cars if I may.

32:12.530 --> 32:15.465
You first of all - first car?

32:15.533 --> 32:19.299
First car, my parents bought me
a Volkswagen Polo, olive green,

32:19.370 --> 32:22.100
which, when my dad gave it to me,
it was on my birthday,

32:22.173 --> 32:23.970
he gave me the keys and it had the VW sign.

32:24.042 --> 32:25.976
I thought it was a Beetle
and got very excited,

32:26.044 --> 32:30.845
and he could see the look on my face
and he said "No, it's not a Beetle, it's a Polo."

32:30.915 --> 32:35.409
You were disappointed that you got a Polo
instead of the Hitlermobile?

32:35.486 --> 32:37.818
It's got character.
When you've got no money for a car.

32:37.889 --> 32:39.481
Horse manure's got character.

32:41.059 --> 32:43.550
And then you, Peter,
your car history.

32:43.628 --> 32:48.122
I understand you once emigrated to Australia
and left a car in a car park?

32:48.199 --> 32:49.564
Not Australia, I mean America.

32:49.634 --> 32:57.166
I parked my car in a car park in St John's Wood
for what I thought was a couple of days,

32:57.241 --> 33:00.472
and then I went to New York to do a play
and I stayed two years.

33:02.280 --> 33:07.684
Effectively forgot really that I'd left it in the
charge of this car park in St John's Wood,

33:07.752 --> 33:12.815
and when I got back, they wanted L5,000
for parking charges, which I didn't have.

33:12.890 --> 33:16.519
- I suspect a lot of actors...
- Exactly.

33:16.594 --> 33:19.324
...wouldn't have L5,000.
- So they took the car.

33:19.397 --> 33:24.664
- What was it?
- It was a Mercedes 300 CE CoupÃ©, 1966.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.966
- Oh, my God!
- Nice car.

33:27.038 --> 33:29.199
Did you not think to ring someone up
in England

33:29.273 --> 33:32.140
and say "I've left my car,
I've decided to stay here."

33:32.210 --> 33:34.974
No, you don't.
This is the man who runs Ml5.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.473
- You're from Yorkshire, aren't you?
- I am.

33:39.550 --> 33:43.145
I've got this thing about actors
who aren't from Yorkshire,

33:43.221 --> 33:45.849
who get jobs playing Yorkshiremen,
people like him, right.

33:45.923 --> 33:47.982
- I'd never played one.
- No, you wouldn't

33:48.059 --> 33:51.119
because they always
put a T in - I'm going to t'pub.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.062
Thank God somebody else has noticed!
I thought it was me.

33:54.132 --> 33:59.570
Emmerdale, Coronation Street -
I'm going to t'foot o't'bloody t'stairs.

34:00.772 --> 34:03.002
It's implying the T, isn't it?

34:03.074 --> 34:05.201
They don't actually say it.

34:05.276 --> 34:06.937
I'm going... pub.

34:07.011 --> 34:09.206
- You remember the band The The?
- Yeah.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.545
They could never play in Yorkshire.
"I'm going to see..."

34:14.351 --> 34:17.583
Now, I've got this poll,
have you seen this?

34:17.655 --> 34:21.091
New Woman's top 100 sexy men.

34:21.958 --> 34:24.393
You, 57th.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.522
The annoying thing about those
is you never look who's behind you,

34:27.598 --> 34:31.261
you look at who's in front of you. There's
always "I can't believe that person's..."

34:31.335 --> 34:35.032
Yes, in 32nd place there's some little
fridge magnet called Richard Hammond.

34:35.106 --> 34:37.540
Where?

34:37.608 --> 34:39.199
You see?

34:39.277 --> 34:41.609
You are one behind Gordon Ramsay.

34:43.313 --> 34:45.612
See, that just ruins the whole thing.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.947
I'd love to get you and Richard Hammond
sharing a flat.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.850
"I want the mirror." "No, me!"

34:53.157 --> 34:56.786
We can get one for him.
Didn't you once try to chat up Jenny Agutter?

34:58.329 --> 34:59.819
How do you know that? I did.

35:01.232 --> 35:04.099
We did a film together
years and years ago,

35:04.168 --> 35:06.728
and then went on the road
doing publicity for it,

35:06.804 --> 35:10.205
and at yet another opening
and another party afterwards,

35:10.274 --> 35:13.300
I did say to her,
having had a few drinks,

35:13.377 --> 35:16.813
"Can you give me one good reason
why we don't go back to my hotel room?"

35:16.881 --> 35:20.009
She said, "I can give you several."

35:20.084 --> 35:21.676
That was the end of it.

35:21.752 --> 35:23.982
It's such a killer, that.
"I can give you several."

35:24.055 --> 35:28.992
Um, I wanna get some rivalry going now.
Who's got the most interesting car now?

35:29.060 --> 35:31.824
I've got an R8 at the moment.

35:31.896 --> 35:33.420
Not bad and you've got a...

35:33.498 --> 35:35.625
I've got a Maserati Cambiocorsa.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.567
- The Cambio, that's the flappy paddle.
- Yeah.

35:38.636 --> 35:41.696
That's pretty good,
so you've actually quite interesting cars.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.263
- They are.
- You both had SLs in the past?

35:44.342 --> 35:46.037
I've still got my SL.

35:46.110 --> 35:50.706
I don't think I'll ever get rid of it.
It was the first decent car I bought.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.806
Which one was it -
the Bobby Ewing or the next one?

35:52.884 --> 35:54.749
- The '86.
- They were very good.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.550
It's lovely. It costs a lot in bodywork,
because I didn't have a garage until recently.

35:58.623 --> 36:01.387
Well, we've seen your bodywork.

36:01.459 --> 36:05.327
Right, so the laps -
who do you think was the fastest?

36:05.396 --> 36:07.421
- I don't know. It's close.
- You think?

36:07.498 --> 36:11.628
I have to say, both of you
looked like you were trying.

36:11.702 --> 36:12.760
Isn't that the point?

36:12.837 --> 36:16.739
Yes, but some people don't look like
they're trying. You two do look like.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.934
We've started to see,
if we have two people a week,

36:19.010 --> 36:21.171
cos it does sort of make you...

36:21.245 --> 36:23.645
- Shall we see the laps? Here we go.
- Yeah!

36:23.714 --> 36:27.548
One of you is first and it is? Who's that?
We'll have to go inside.

36:27.618 --> 36:30.485
- On guard!
- It's you, Peter.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.386
Did you like the Lacetti?

36:32.456 --> 36:34.583
- Wonderful car.
- Isn't it just?

36:35.493 --> 36:37.051
Yeah, who's the daddy?

36:39.630 --> 36:41.928
# Yes, that's the way

36:41.999 --> 36:44.058
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it #

36:45.102 --> 36:48.868
0h dear, madness - the breeze of insanity
is blowing through your head.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.306
Come on, you have some power in there!

36:52.410 --> 36:54.037
We come into the Hammerhead.

36:54.979 --> 36:56.310
Oo-er, missus.

36:56.380 --> 37:00.043
- Yes, that's a man on...
- You stayed in the lines.

37:00.117 --> 37:01.778
He did well there.

37:01.852 --> 37:07.256
I've got the air conditioning off. It gives me
two extra horsepower apparently. It's worth it.

37:07.325 --> 37:10.385
And it's kinder to the environment
and you use less petrol.

37:11.629 --> 37:14.291
And we don't care about that.
Look at thatl

37:14.365 --> 37:16.765
That was good, you moved the camera -
always important.

37:16.834 --> 37:18.768
Second to last corner. 0ff the road a bit.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.728
And through Gambon...

37:22.807 --> 37:24.707
...and there we are, across the line.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.539
Now, who wants to see Rupert's lap?

37:31.616 --> 37:35.484
- Yes!
- OK, play the tape. Here we go.

37:35.720 --> 37:37.517
Here we go. Rupert's under way.

37:40.224 --> 37:43.022
Yeah, we can bleep that out.

37:43.094 --> 37:48.657
You're saying "Fancy that, bother"
is what he said there behind the pixels.

37:48.733 --> 37:53.033
That was a sudden turn, got a bit...
That was quick. That is quick.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.698
Oh, my heart's racing. Whoo!

37:56.807 --> 38:00.903
That's wide,
and then getting tight again.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.843
Not bad, not bad.

38:02.913 --> 38:04.244
Does it look as fast as it feels?

38:04.315 --> 38:07.113
- No, it looks really slow.
- That looks really slow.

38:07.184 --> 38:08.879
But it isn't.

38:08.953 --> 38:14.084
That's understeer. It does... No, wait, you stay
between the lines brilliantly as well.

38:15.026 --> 38:17.290
Come on, come on, this has got nothing!

38:17.361 --> 38:20.421
It has, it's got racing seats and a roll cagel

38:21.799 --> 38:24.233
It's a good job we have a spare car, isn't it?

38:24.302 --> 38:25.894
0therwise this wouldn't work very well.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.962
Second to last corner,
this catches people out. It's got you againl

38:29.040 --> 38:30.064
Ooh!

38:31.008 --> 38:35.308
That's off-roading, that's off-roading
and more off-roading, but there we are!

38:44.422 --> 38:46.356
So, where do we think we've come?

38:46.424 --> 38:49.018
Let's have a look. Let's do Peter first.

38:49.093 --> 38:50.856
Where do you reckon, Peter?

38:50.928 --> 38:53.795
No, wait, I've changed my mind. Rupert.

38:53.864 --> 38:56.025
- Me?
- You don't know why I've done that.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.692
No.

38:57.768 --> 39:00.532
Rupert, where do you think you've come?

39:00.604 --> 39:02.162
Above James Blunt?

39:02.239 --> 39:05.606
- Where's James Blunt? What time is he?
- You're looking very low.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.076
- Above James Blunt?
- Around the middle.

39:08.145 --> 39:10.170
1:48.3.

39:10.247 --> 39:13.705
You did it in 1...

39:13.784 --> 39:15.046
40...

39:16.087 --> 39:19.352
...8.1,

39:19.423 --> 39:22.790
so, yes, above James Blunt.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.021
What a good guess!

39:26.097 --> 39:28.964
So, do you reckon you've beaten him?

39:29.033 --> 39:30.898
I think I might have edged it.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.094
I've got the time here.

39:32.169 --> 39:34.228
My two boys said
"As long as you come in the top half,

39:34.305 --> 39:37.138
"then it won't be embarrassing in school."

39:37.208 --> 39:39.938
You did it... in 1...

39:41.512 --> 39:42.945
40...

39:44.682 --> 39:46.309
Look at his little face!

39:46.384 --> 39:48.909
...7.1.
- No!

39:48.986 --> 39:52.080
Yes, you did!
Give him a round of applause, he's there!

39:59.263 --> 40:00.389
That's a grimace.

40:00.464 --> 40:03.365
That is a grimace. Well done.

40:04.468 --> 40:07.665
That's an impressive time.
You've beaten the Well Spoken Man.

40:07.738 --> 40:10.332
But wait...

40:10.408 --> 40:13.571
...you're the fastest Welshman!

40:13.644 --> 40:15.578
Oh, great!

40:17.114 --> 40:21.414
And you are easily
the fastest person from Yorkshire.

40:21.485 --> 40:24.477
So, there we are.
It's been a pleasure having you here.

40:24.555 --> 40:27.422
Thank you so much for coming.
Best of luck with the new series.

40:27.491 --> 40:29.391
Best of luck with everything else you're up to.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.826
Ladies and gentlemen,
the chaps from Spooks.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.227
Thank you.

40:35.966 --> 40:39.595
Now, you know how Fifth Gear
burned down our Cool Wall?

40:39.670 --> 40:43.470
Well, we've got a new one -
here it is, the Cool Wall is back.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.873
Yeah, we have a Cool Wall.

40:47.044 --> 40:49.808
That feels better. It does feel better.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.212
It's back and it all needs rearranging.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.342
It's all wrong.

40:54.418 --> 40:56.613
There's a lot to do.
The CitroÃ«n C5.

40:56.687 --> 40:59.178
CitroÃ«n C5, very good-looking.

40:59.256 --> 41:01.451
- Beautiful car.
- Beautiful looking car.

41:01.525 --> 41:02.924
I've made my mind up on this one.

41:02.993 --> 41:05.723
So have I - it's large and French,
therefore it's uncool.

41:05.796 --> 41:07.195
You're wrong, it's cool.

41:07.264 --> 41:09.255
No, it's large and French. OK?

41:09.333 --> 41:12.166
Certain nationalities do certain things.
The French cook.

41:12.236 --> 41:16.172
How many people have ever said
"I fancy going out tonight, darling,

41:16.240 --> 41:17.639
"do you fancy eating German?"

41:17.708 --> 41:19.767
No, I grant you that.

41:19.844 --> 41:22.677
How many people have ever said
"I want some flat pack furniture,

41:22.746 --> 41:25.613
"so what I'm gonna do is go see
Mr. Phopolopoulos in Athens."

41:25.683 --> 41:27.014
No, you've got this wrong.

41:27.084 --> 41:32.283
A large French car is like
a Tunisian fitted kitchen, it doesn't work.

41:32.356 --> 41:34.153
- Is it?
- Yes, in my mind.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.193
No, you're wrong for that exact reason.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.694
Everybody thinks if they want
a large car, buy German.

41:38.762 --> 41:42.596
To buy French, when it's a very handsome car
as well, that's a more clever decision.

41:42.666 --> 41:43.826
Oh, go on then.

41:43.901 --> 41:45.960
- What?
- Go on then. I can't be bothered to argue.

41:46.036 --> 41:47.697
You can put it in Cool.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.500
- Is this a trap?
- Yes, we put it in Cool?

41:49.573 --> 41:52.508
- No!
- Don't say that, he's never given in before!

41:52.576 --> 41:54.601
Watch this. Do it.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.612
There's no chainsaw coming out the wall?

41:56.680 --> 41:58.614
- No.
- OK.

41:58.682 --> 42:03.142
Now, we have a momentous
Cool Wall moment.

42:03.220 --> 42:06.053
BMW M3, here it is.

42:07.658 --> 42:09.626
Been in Uncool for a long time, as we know.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.456
This is cock central.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.465
It's the only car we've ever had
that broke the Top Gear cockometer.

42:16.667 --> 42:18.259
The thing is, OK?

42:18.335 --> 42:23.102
The cocks who had these, have become
fed up with being labeled a cock,

42:23.173 --> 42:25.971
even before they've opened their mouths, OK?

42:26.043 --> 42:27.977
So they've moved on,

42:28.045 --> 42:33.506
leaving the people who were prepared
to weather the storm of hate behind.

42:33.584 --> 42:35.779
So, the only people driving M3s now,

42:35.853 --> 42:38.617
are the people who appreciate
just what a damn good car it is.

42:38.689 --> 42:42.853
- This is therefore now cool.
- Annoyingly, I think you're right.

42:42.927 --> 42:45.293
BMW have made a cool car.

42:45.362 --> 42:47.626
Here's the big question for you all -

42:47.698 --> 42:50.132
if the cocks have moved out of the M3,

42:50.200 --> 42:53.431
where do you think they've ended up?

42:53.504 --> 42:56.029
- Oh, God, Hedgehog Man.
- Audi.

42:56.106 --> 42:59.098
He's there.
Hedgehog Man has got it right.

42:59.176 --> 43:01.872
Well done, Hedgehog Man.

43:01.946 --> 43:05.347
All Audis... Where are they all?
They're all hovering around up here.

43:05.416 --> 43:10.251
Specifically, they've ended up in that one,
the RS4.

43:10.321 --> 43:14.815
You get some idiot now, an eighteenth
of an inch off your back bumper,

43:14.892 --> 43:20.057
I guarantee he's in an Audi.
These are now seriously uncool cocks' cars.

43:20.130 --> 43:21.688
Anyone got an Audi?

43:21.765 --> 43:25.257
Cock, cock, cock...

43:25.336 --> 43:28.965
And they've all got those Breitling watches -
have you seen them, with the button?

43:30.407 --> 43:34.173
Has this got the button that if I push it,
the helicopter comes?

43:34.244 --> 43:35.268
It is, it's out there now.

43:35.346 --> 43:38.440
- This is the watch. You don't have an Audi?
- I used to have an Audi.

43:40.784 --> 43:44.880
This is chief cock with his St Tropez tan.
What have you got now?

43:44.955 --> 43:48.413
- Land Rover.
- Land? What do you mean, "Yeah!"?

43:48.492 --> 43:50.517
Whoo!

43:51.962 --> 43:53.224
James owns one of those.

43:53.297 --> 43:56.562
James May owns one of these -
what's it doing up...

44:09.013 --> 44:13.382
They are the rules. You've taken it to the limit,
but they are the rules.

44:13.450 --> 44:15.611
You can't get much less cool that that.

44:15.686 --> 44:18.382
You know how we just got the Cool Wall back?
I'd like to do some changes.

44:18.455 --> 44:22.448
I've got an important one I wanna do which is,
bear with me on this,

44:22.526 --> 44:27.554
all Aston Martins, all of them,
are now rendered uncool.

44:27.631 --> 44:28.962
They've all moved down the board.

44:29.033 --> 44:31.558
Bear with me.

44:31.635 --> 44:35.537
- I've given this some thought.
- What do you mean they're uncool?

44:35.606 --> 44:40.509
For instance, there is a sort of natural
cosmopolitan cockometer in the world,

44:40.577 --> 44:42.135
called the King's Road in London,

44:42.212 --> 44:46.239
and it used to be jammed full of 911s,
all of them.

44:46.316 --> 44:49.979
Now, every single one
is a cock in an Aston Martin.

44:50.054 --> 44:52.488
Every single one,
all you see is Aston Martins.

44:52.556 --> 44:55.753
- Rubbish!
- I know it's a big leap, it's a big leap.

44:55.826 --> 44:58.590
- It's a big leap.
- Have you any evidence that they are cocks?

44:58.662 --> 45:00.152
- A lot of evidence.
- Where is it?

45:00.230 --> 45:03.222
Right, hang on a second.
For instance, all of these people -

45:03.300 --> 45:05.791
Frank Lampard, Paolo Maldini,
Thierry Henry,

45:05.869 --> 45:10.169
Beckham, Wayne Rooney...
Lan Wright, Shaun Wright-Phillips...

45:10.240 --> 45:12.902
- have all got Aston Martins.
- The coolest footballers.

45:12.976 --> 45:14.671
- The coolest what?
- Footballers.

45:14.745 --> 45:16.610
- It's a footballers' car.
- It's not.

45:16.680 --> 45:19.148
- Wayne Rooney's got one!
- That is a letdown.

45:19.216 --> 45:20.774
- He crashed it.
- Yes, he did.

45:20.851 --> 45:22.842
It was crashed by a plank
who looks like Shrek.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.319
Yes.

45:24.388 --> 45:27.084
- They're all terrible.
- No, you're completely wrong.

45:27.157 --> 45:29.125
You're not having the DB9.

45:29.193 --> 45:30.387
I tell you what.

45:30.461 --> 45:34.761
- You touch the DB9...
- I can't. It's locked.

45:36.366 --> 45:38.994
There, it's gone, it's down here.

45:40.637 --> 45:43.071
Whoo!

45:43.140 --> 45:48.578
I'm right. None of you believe me now.
One day you will come round and realize...

45:48.645 --> 45:50.943
Oh, thanks, yeah, all right.

45:52.416 --> 45:54.111
That's always your solution.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.046
Right, Fridge Magnet.

46:00.224 --> 46:03.022
- BMW X6. What?
- Ah, yes!

46:03.093 --> 46:04.060
- Cool?
- Wrong.

46:04.128 --> 46:05.459
- No, it is.
- More...

46:06.363 --> 46:10.959
No, that is actually a cool... No!
That's my microphone!

46:11.034 --> 46:12.399
It is your microphone,

46:12.469 --> 46:13.595
and now you can't argue.

46:13.670 --> 46:17.800
This is... a truly shocking car.

46:17.875 --> 46:22.471
They said "No, it's a four-wheel drive car.
"No, let's make it look like a coupÃ©."

46:22.546 --> 46:25.982
That's saying "I want a Wellington
that looks like a ballet shoe."

46:26.049 --> 46:29.416
It's really uncool and that's an end of it.

46:30.187 --> 46:34.715
Now listen, when was the last time
you just got up and went for a drive?

46:34.792 --> 46:38.956
Not to anywhere, not for anything,
just for a drive.

46:39.029 --> 46:43.432
See, motorcyclists do it all the time,
so why don't human beings?

46:46.036 --> 46:49.631
The price of petrol has something to do with it,
but I think it's more than that.

46:49.706 --> 46:53.665
Could it be that cars
just aren't exciting enough these days?

47:00.417 --> 47:06.253
This, however, might just be enough
to get you out of bed before the dawn.

47:06.323 --> 47:10.851
It's a special version of the AMG CLK.

47:10.928 --> 47:13.897
It's more powerful, it's more pumped up.

47:13.964 --> 47:16.762
They call it The Black.

47:28.412 --> 47:30.312
This is brilliant.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.910
No phone, no kids,

47:32.983 --> 47:35.076
no interruptions.

47:35.152 --> 47:39.987
It's just... me in my little metal shell.

47:40.624 --> 47:43.320
Time to think, time to work stuff out.

47:45.195 --> 47:47.629
Small wonder crabs are so wise.

47:52.135 --> 47:56.003
And this really is an ideal car
for when it's four in the morning

47:56.073 --> 48:02.103
and you've got the whole 400,000-mile
British road network all to yourself.

48:04.882 --> 48:08.909
What they've done
to create this L100,000 monster,

48:08.986 --> 48:13.286
is remove the rear seats,
the electric motors for the front seats,

48:13.357 --> 48:16.918
the electric motor for the steering column,
the satnav, some of the airbags.

48:16.994 --> 48:19.121
They've fitted carbon-fiber door panels

48:19.196 --> 48:20.686
and carbon-fiber spoilers,

48:20.764 --> 48:23.892
and the result of all this weight saving is

48:23.967 --> 48:28.666
that it weights just a little bit more
than when they started.

48:35.779 --> 48:40.443
That's because, underneath,
it has a wider, industrial-strength rear axel.

48:40.517 --> 48:43.850
It has a differential
made from a blend of lead and granite.

48:44.721 --> 48:47.622
It's a weapons-grade car this,
and it needs to be,

48:47.691 --> 48:51.593
to contain the fury
of what's under the bonnet.

48:58.135 --> 49:01.901
There's so much fury, in fact,
that if you were to unleash it all,

49:01.972 --> 49:04.304
pretty soon you'd be...

49:05.309 --> 49:06.742
...very far from home.

49:17.254 --> 49:21.748
They're used to monsters and dragons
in this part of Wales,

49:21.825 --> 49:26.524
but I bet they've never heard one
that sounds like this.

49:31.201 --> 49:34.534
This thing really is the kin of Cain.

49:40.978 --> 49:46.245
The standard 6.2 liter engine
that Mercedes uses in its AMG models,

49:46.316 --> 49:47.874
is already bonkers enough.

49:47.951 --> 49:51.079
If it had a tongue,
it would go around licking windows.

49:52.322 --> 49:55.485
But in this, they fiddled with the electronics
and the exhaust,

49:55.559 --> 50:00.622
and the result
is a dollop of full-bore savagery.

50:02.466 --> 50:05.333
In fact, this car is so fast and so mad,

50:05.402 --> 50:09.361
it was even delivered with a warning letter
from the people who made it.

50:11.041 --> 50:15.501
I've been road-testing cars nearly 25 years now
and that has never happened before,

50:15.579 --> 50:21.711
but, I've got it here and it says, "Ensure the oil
is warm before driving enthusiastically."

50:23.587 --> 50:24.747
Well, it will be now.

50:25.288 --> 50:29.554
"The car is savage, it's very aggressive
and racy in its setup."

50:30.260 --> 50:32.285
This is Mercedes themselves.

50:32.362 --> 50:36.025
"On anything other than dry roads
it is extremely lively.

50:36.733 --> 50:39.827
"Quite tail happy,
even under partial throttle.

50:39.903 --> 50:42.303
"The traction control must stay on."

50:43.006 --> 50:45.474
Sounds dangerous.

50:53.450 --> 50:58.444
It isn't dangerous, though,
it's just incredibly good fun.

50:59.689 --> 51:04.991
I thought it was gonna be like a BMW M3
but it's in a completely different league.

51:06.229 --> 51:11.098
It's just so much more noisy
and powerful and exciting.

51:12.035 --> 51:16.529
It even slows down more violently,
thanks to its carbon brakes.

51:19.743 --> 51:25.443
I only had three hours' sleep last night,
but I have never felt more awake than this.

51:27.484 --> 51:29.714
It's like a Saturn 5 rocket.

51:29.786 --> 51:31.583
Whoa!

51:32.823 --> 51:36.691
I've often wondered why they call these
the Black mountains,

51:36.760 --> 51:39.820
because they're not black,
they're sort of green and brown.

51:39.896 --> 51:42.091
Now, I know, though.

51:42.165 --> 51:44.656
They were named... for this car.

51:51.975 --> 51:53.567
Hurry up, sunshine.

51:54.478 --> 51:56.139
Here we go.

52:03.186 --> 52:04.585
Christ, it's fast!

52:18.768 --> 52:23.728
Don't get me wrong, though,
that is not... a racing car with number plates.

52:23.807 --> 52:27.971
It's not superstiff, supertaut,
set up for the track.

52:28.044 --> 52:31.673
Because if it was, I'd be sitting here now
with blood pouring out of my ears

52:31.748 --> 52:35.479
and a smashed skeleton,
thinking "Why did I go for a drive?

52:35.552 --> 52:38.646
"Why didn't I just get up
and play table tennis?"

52:45.061 --> 52:48.428
Even though it has a racing car's
flared wheel arches

52:48.498 --> 52:51.262
and even though
some of the luxuries are gone,

52:51.334 --> 52:54.201
it still has an automatic gearbox,

52:54.271 --> 52:56.796
it's still got cruise control
and air -conditioning.

52:56.873 --> 52:59.706
It's still totally civilized.

52:59.776 --> 53:03.837
Which means you can sit back and indulge
yourself in what this show's all about -

53:03.914 --> 53:07.509
the absolute joy of driving a great car...

53:08.818 --> 53:10.217
...on a great road.

53:30.173 --> 53:35.110
What The Black does then, is blend
genuine red-eyed supercar madness

53:35.178 --> 53:37.578
with drip-dry everyday practicality.

53:46.656 --> 53:48.453
I'm completely in love with it.

53:48.525 --> 53:52.621
The only thing that's stopping me
from plowing on... is that.

53:56.099 --> 53:59.068
I've run out of British Isles.

54:07.143 --> 54:09.703
It's a good job they didn't film
Thelma And Louise in Britain.

54:09.779 --> 54:11.804
It would only have been four minutes long.

54:11.881 --> 54:13.849
"Bah, we've gone into Cheddar Gorge!"

54:14.884 --> 54:17.352
It's all I could find!

54:17.420 --> 54:19.388
So, is it really that good?

54:19.456 --> 54:21.788
Yes, Simon Bates, this is...

54:21.858 --> 54:25.316
...this is my new favorite car,

54:25.395 --> 54:27.022
and I'm not alone either.

54:27.097 --> 54:29.122
Don't look at me.

54:29.199 --> 54:30.723
I wasn't actually.

54:30.800 --> 54:34.930
No, the Stig drove this last week, said it's
the most entertaining car he's driven in years.

54:35.005 --> 54:40.136
That really is enough of cars now. Next week,
normal accident-prone service is resumed.

54:40.210 --> 54:42.542
We spend the entire program falling over.

54:42.612 --> 54:44.204
- Breaking down.
- Crashing.

54:44.281 --> 54:47.011
So, we'll see you then.
Thanks for watching. Take care.
