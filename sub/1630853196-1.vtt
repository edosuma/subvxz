00:06.000 --> 00:09.880
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.960 --> 00:15.320
<i>It was in Amsterdam, 1989.</i>

00:15.920 --> 00:17.760
<i>And this is Frank Stigter.</i>

00:18.440 --> 00:22.280
<i>He's about to drive his brand-new</i>
<i>Ferrari Testarossa into the water.</i>

00:23.000 --> 00:26.800
<i>Frank always says, "Turnover</i>
<i>is profit and VAT is holiday pay."</i>

00:28.280 --> 00:32.680
<i>And when he earned his first million,</i>
<i>he treated himself to a new car.</i>

00:32.760 --> 00:35.840
<i>But he couldn't choose</i>
<i>between a Ferrari and a Porsche.</i>

00:36.400 --> 00:38.360
<i>So he just bought them both.</i>

00:38.440 --> 00:42.200
<i>And he drove the Ferrari on even days</i>
<i>and the Porsche on odd days.</i>

00:43.280 --> 00:44.600
I can't wait any longer.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.920
<i>Frank was my boss,</i>
<i>the founder of Teledutch,</i>

00:48.000 --> 00:49.920
<i>together with his younger brother, Ramon.</i>

00:50.000 --> 00:51.440
-Go on.
-<i>Also a millionaire.</i>

00:52.040 --> 00:56.600
<i>Teledutch was the first</i>
<i>Dutch company to have telephone sex lines.</i>

00:59.240 --> 01:01.800
-Yes, come on!
-<i>Here, this is me.</i>

01:01.880 --> 01:03.040
<i>Marly Salomon.</i>

01:03.560 --> 01:05.760
I'm actually quite the prude.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.280
<i>Yes, even then.</i>

01:09.880 --> 01:13.000
<i>This was</i>
<i>New Year's Eve, 1989, in the RoXY.</i>

01:13.080 --> 01:17.720
<i>And that DJ there is Mischa Brandt.</i>
<i>He was my best friend Janna's boyfriend.</i>

01:23.640 --> 01:25.320
<i>By the way, this isn't Janna.</i>

01:25.840 --> 01:26.880
<i>The blonde.</i>

01:27.520 --> 01:28.480
<i>That's Janna.</i>

01:29.480 --> 01:31.240
<i>She gave me my first little pill.</i>

01:31.320 --> 01:32.840
Seven, six,

01:32.920 --> 01:34.800
five, four,

01:34.880 --> 01:38.200
three, two, one!

01:40.920 --> 01:42.520
Hey, DJ! Music!

01:43.040 --> 01:43.920
Oh, yeah.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.200
<i>I swear,</i>

01:51.280 --> 01:53.880
<i>it was the best time of my life.</i>

01:54.520 --> 01:56.680
<i>The crisis of the '80s was over</i>

01:56.760 --> 02:00.080
<i>and everyone at Teledutch</i>
<i>was making a ton of money.</i>

02:01.120 --> 02:04.080
<i>So how come Frank,</i>
<i>the boss of this empire,</i>

02:04.160 --> 02:06.480
<i>was about to throw it all away?</i>

02:25.240 --> 02:27.360
<i>Things could only get better.</i>

02:29.360 --> 02:30.200
<i>Right?</i>

02:35.400 --> 02:40.200
THREE YEARS EARLIER

02:41.560 --> 02:44.760
<i>Who would've thought</i>
<i>that a story about telephone sex lines</i>

02:44.840 --> 02:48.840
<i>would start with a prudish student</i>
<i>from a sleepy suburb of Amsterdam?</i>

02:53.040 --> 02:54.000
<i>Take a look.</i>

02:55.040 --> 02:57.600
<i>This is what we called dancing back then.</i>

02:58.720 --> 03:02.120
<i>The most important thing</i>
<i>was to not show you were having fun.</i>

03:17.040 --> 03:19.800
-I have to go.
-Already? This is so much fun.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.720
You can stay over at my place.

03:23.320 --> 03:26.360
I think I'll have space in my bed tonight.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.320
My parents will worry. I need to go.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.160
There's going to be
a room available at our place,

03:33.240 --> 03:36.440
and you should come live with us!

03:36.520 --> 03:38.040
That would be awesome.

03:38.120 --> 03:41.640
I know what my mother will say.
"What do you want with that dirty city?"

03:41.720 --> 03:45.240
"You like it here. I feed you well."
She's not going to pay for it.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.960
You can get a job, right?

03:47.040 --> 03:49.320
-Recording sex tapes.
-Yes.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.240
That's 50 guilders, right?
Just 15 minutes of work.

03:52.320 --> 03:53.800
I'm not much of a dirty talker.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.040
But you'd never
have to take the last bus again.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.160
Fuck, my bus.

03:58.240 --> 04:00.440
-See? This is what I mean.
-I've got to go.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.840
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

04:08.840 --> 04:09.840
-Bye.
-Bye.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.680
-Hashish?
-No thanks.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.880
-Coke?
-No thanks.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.720
<i>Amsterdam as you know it didn't exist yet.</i>

04:28.640 --> 04:31.000
<i>Hookers were soliciting</i>
<i>behind Centraal Station,</i>

04:31.520 --> 04:33.760
<i>entire neighborhoods were crumbling,</i>

04:34.280 --> 04:36.920
<i>coke was being sold openly on Dam Square,</i>

04:37.600 --> 04:40.480
<i>and if you couldn't find</i>
<i>a house, you'd squat.</i>

04:41.600 --> 04:46.000
<i>Until the owner sent over some vigilantes</i>
<i>to force you out with baseball bats.</i>

04:51.840 --> 04:55.920
<i>But I lived in a suburb</i>
<i>five kilometers away.</i>

04:56.000 --> 04:57.920
<i>In another universe.</i>

04:58.000 --> 05:01.080
<i>Light years away</i>
<i>from where everything happened.</i>

05:15.360 --> 05:16.440
Did you have fun?

05:16.520 --> 05:18.880
Dad, you don't always need to wait up.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.800
Yeah.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.240
It was really fun.

05:22.760 --> 05:23.600
Good.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.040
-Good night.
-Sleep tight.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.040
Dad? What do you think…

05:35.440 --> 05:36.640
I want to move out.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.880
It's more convenient
if I live close to the university.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.600
I can study in my room
in between lectures.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.960
-How much is it?
-Three hundred guilders.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.320
-But I can get a job.
-What kind of job?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.200
Just a job. Waitressing.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.960
No, I don't want that.
You're not waiting on anyone.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.160
What kind of filth is this?

06:02.440 --> 06:05.440
-The syllabus for the next term.
-And?

06:06.280 --> 06:07.960
I'm taking sexology classes.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.000
What's that good for?

06:12.520 --> 06:15.840
As a therapist, you also need
to help people with sexual problems.

06:15.920 --> 06:18.720
She would've been better off
going to law school.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.440
Marly wants to move out.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.080
What do you want with that dirty city?
You like it here. I feed you well.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.080
I need to move out at some point, don't I?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.840
Why? We never had our own place.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.680
I could just move in with Janna and Eva.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.200
This is what students do.
I'll just work for it.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.360
Work is good. If you want to be happy,
you have to make money.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.240
-But you're not moving out.
-Bye, sweetheart. Bye, darling.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.880
-But Mom, I--
-No.

06:59.160 --> 07:00.000
<i>Good.</i>

07:00.880 --> 07:05.040
For years, it was believed that sexuality

07:05.120 --> 07:09.000
stems from an innate instinct or a drive

07:09.880 --> 07:11.600
for the main reason of--

07:12.400 --> 07:13.320
Sorry.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.400
Yes. You're late, miss.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.920
Yes, sorry.

07:21.000 --> 07:26.400
My research on the male sex organ
ran over a little bit.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.240
Yes.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.280
My field requires
a serious approach, young lady.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.480
Take a seat.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.440
Within the reproductive theory,
lust would…

07:39.520 --> 07:41.720
Has he ever had sex himself?

07:42.240 --> 07:44.640
I've heard good things
about men with beards.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.360
What? You've heard good things?

07:46.440 --> 07:47.320
…this concept…

07:47.920 --> 07:51.360
Ladies, is my lecture
interrupting your conversation?

07:51.440 --> 07:55.320
Oh, no. We're discussing
the advantages of facial hair

07:55.400 --> 07:57.200
when performing cunnilingus.

07:57.840 --> 07:58.680
Yes.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.600
Can I ask you and your neighbor
to leave the lecture hall?

08:02.680 --> 08:03.560
-Me?
-Yes.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.560
Perhaps you should apply to drama school.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.640
Yes.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.600
I spoke to the landlord,
by the way. The room's yours.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.640
-You can move in next week.
-Jan.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.680
My mother won't let me, just like I said.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.120
And it's her decision?

08:22.880 --> 08:24.200
How old are you?

08:24.720 --> 08:27.520
-She doesn't want to pay.
-But you have a student loan, right?

08:27.600 --> 08:29.680
-Yes.
-You can make up the rest.

08:32.120 --> 08:33.600
I don't know if I can.

08:37.680 --> 08:41.560
Your hard cock
slides deep inside me. And my…

08:41.640 --> 08:43.400
my lips are getting so wet!

08:43.480 --> 08:45.360
-I'm so wet! Take me!
-Jan.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.560
-Fuck me!
-Jan!

08:48.760 --> 08:49.840
Behave yourself.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.680
Think of it
as an investment in your sex life.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.800
What sex life?

08:57.360 --> 08:59.040
Exactly, that's what I mean.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.120
How will you ever take a guy
to your room if you don't have a room?

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
You can at least try, right?

09:08.560 --> 09:11.880
<i>It's a normal office downtown,</i>
<i>nothing gross.</i>

09:11.960 --> 09:14.280
<i>Within half an hour,</i>
<i>you'll have 50 guilders.</i>

09:14.360 --> 09:16.720
<i>If you do it once</i>
<i>or twice a week, you're done.</i>

09:20.360 --> 09:21.560
<i>There I stood.</i>

09:22.200 --> 09:24.440
<i>On the day</i>
<i>that would change my life forever.</i>

09:25.640 --> 09:27.080
<i>And not just mine.</i>

09:27.160 --> 09:30.080
-Does it look good?
-Yes. All ready.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.520
<i>Is my hair okay?</i>

09:32.040 --> 09:34.440
-Is his hair okay? Yes, right?
-Yeah, it's okay.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.960
-Well, then I go there…
-Yup.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.360
Good luck.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.240
Good. Come on.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.480
-What I--
-Look.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.720
It's all about libido.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.400
Men are always up for sex.

09:57.240 --> 10:00.560
This is simple biology.
It's one egg per month versus

10:00.640 --> 10:04.480
billions of sperm every day
eager to go on an adventure.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.240
There's no way for women to do that.
So, at Teledutch,

10:08.320 --> 10:10.400
we offer a service that helps men

10:11.040 --> 10:12.880
<i>to do something with that drive.</i>

10:13.800 --> 10:16.560
<i>What Frank is saying is complete bullshit.</i>

10:16.640 --> 10:20.440
<i>There's no such thing as libido.</i>
<i>Janna, please explain.</i>

10:20.960 --> 10:23.800
<i>"Libido" was invented by Freud.</i>

10:23.880 --> 10:26.840
<i>But there's no research to show</i>
<i>that there really is such a thing</i>

10:26.920 --> 10:29.520
<i>as a pent-up lust that forces men to hunt.</i>

10:29.600 --> 10:32.920
<i>-But what can I say?</i>
<i>-It's 1987.</i>

10:33.000 --> 10:36.840
<i>It's the time where scientists</i>
<i>still think that the clitoris</i>

10:36.920 --> 10:38.520
<i>is a tiny pea,</i>

10:39.600 --> 10:41.160
<i>rather than the tip of a</i>

10:42.360 --> 10:43.600
<i>gigantic pyramid.</i>

10:43.680 --> 10:47.000
<i>It will be another seven years</i>
<i>before Janna, with her doctorate research,</i>

10:47.080 --> 10:49.520
<i>proves that women</i>
<i>are physiologically aroused</i>

10:49.600 --> 10:51.880
<i>just as easily as men.</i>

10:51.960 --> 10:55.000
<i>From a young age, men see</i>
<i>a penis hanging between their legs</i>

10:55.080 --> 10:57.720
<i>that gets hard</i>
<i>at appropriate and inappropriate times.</i>

10:57.800 --> 10:58.680
<i>So, what do you do?</i>

11:01.280 --> 11:02.800
<i>You give it a tug.</i>

11:10.520 --> 11:11.360
Anita?

11:12.040 --> 11:13.360
You can go to the studio.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.520
Hi.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.880
Sorry, I had an appointment.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.320
Marly Salomon. Janna signed me up.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.680
Take a seat on the bench.
We'll call you through.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.600
Sorry, but it's my first time, so…

11:38.280 --> 11:42.080
How exactly does it work?
Don't I need to audition or something?

11:42.160 --> 11:43.120
Do you speak Dutch?

11:44.200 --> 11:45.840
-Yes.
-Then you're hired.

11:46.360 --> 11:50.640
Now, take a seat
and wait till you hear your name. 

11:59.480 --> 12:00.400
Which do you have?

12:02.080 --> 12:04.800
Ah yes, the racing bike.
I had that last week. 

12:04.880 --> 12:06.720
Can you picture me on a racing bike?

12:13.440 --> 12:16.520
-Do you have to read this word for word?
-No.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.160
You can improvise.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.440
Drama school. She studied for this.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.280
But you have to moan, okay?
That's important. You know?

12:32.280 --> 12:34.120
-Like that, okay?
-Yes.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.560
How do you explain
the success of the sex lines?

12:39.640 --> 12:41.320
That's a good question.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.520
I'd say anonymity.

12:45.600 --> 12:50.800
Many men are still embarrassed
to rent a film, buy a magazine,

12:50.880 --> 12:53.640
but there's no need for that with us.
You can just call.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.960
At home, at work, on the toilet, wherever.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.160
Always completely anonymous.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.920
But the possibilities
of commercial telecommunications

13:05.520 --> 13:06.480
are endless.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.920
<i>Six months ago,</i>
<i>Ramon Stigter was just a cable installer.</i>

13:14.280 --> 13:15.400
Do you want a coffee?

13:16.320 --> 13:18.480
<i>A job which also had its advantages.</i>

13:20.800 --> 13:21.760
I don't like coffee.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.120
For many men, the step

13:25.200 --> 13:28.720
to having a real conversation
with a woman is still far too big.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.360
And it's more expensive
and you get a separate invoice.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.400
With us, the costs are simply added
to your regular telephone bill.

13:36.480 --> 13:37.520
Nobody sees it.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.040
But the possibilities

13:39.120 --> 13:41.600
of commercial telecommunications
are endless.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.280
-Very smart.
-Right, Ramon?

13:44.160 --> 13:46.160
Yes, let's start the tour.

13:46.240 --> 13:50.360
Well, I just have one more question.
How did you come up with the idea?

13:55.680 --> 13:58.240
Indeed. Let's start the tour.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.800
Hi. Sorry.

14:03.360 --> 14:04.400
Can I perhaps…

14:05.520 --> 14:07.600
Can I perhaps get a different story?

14:08.640 --> 14:10.560
I'm not much into cycling.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.080
Thank you.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.400
-You can go to the studio.
-Now?

14:21.560 --> 14:22.760
Can't I just…

14:24.600 --> 14:25.440
Okay.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.920
This is the epicenter.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.360
The beating heart of Teledutch.
Do you see all these red lights?

14:34.960 --> 14:37.240
-Oh, yes.
-Those are the men calling in.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.320
And as you can see, we have room to grow.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.520
Yes. So if each call
is 50 cents per minute

14:44.600 --> 14:48.120
and 20 lines are open 24 hours a day,
that's a lot of money.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.960
It's not too bad. Ninety percent
of the income goes to the PTT.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.400
But that means it goes to every taxpayer.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.320
<i>The Netherlands jerks itself rich.</i>

14:57.400 --> 15:00.440
-Okay, shall we continue?
-You got that, right? Because I can just…

15:01.280 --> 15:03.680
-The Netherlands jerks itself rich.
-Let's move on.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.400
-Yes.
-Yes, right? Good.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.320
Now, Kees…

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
Shall we continue?

15:08.800 --> 15:09.640
Going well, eh?

15:10.360 --> 15:14.160
Frank, we should present ourselves as
a professional telecommunications company.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.160
-Ramon.
-Yes.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.400
We want people to talk about us.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.600
Okay?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.000
Okay, Marly. When you're ready.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.040
-Can I just start?
-Yes. Go ahead.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.440
Sauna.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.360
It's so peaceful in the sauna.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.600
Sweat drips down my neck
between my breasts.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.560
I open my towel and lie down.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.960
I run my hands over my body.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.080
Yes, Marly.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.840
We'll do that again.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.440
It could be a little more… sultry.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.240
-Sultry?
-Less dry.

15:57.760 --> 15:58.600
Less dry?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.200
-Less dry, yes.
-Okay.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.120
-Okay.
-Yes.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.120
It's so peaceful in the sauna.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.800
Sweat… Sorry.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.680
-I'll try again, okay?
-That's…

16:16.240 --> 16:17.200
It's so

16:18.240 --> 16:19.080
peaceful

16:19.720 --> 16:21.000
in the sauna.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.800
Sweat drips down my neck
between my breasts.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.200
RECORDING IN PROGRESS

16:27.280 --> 16:30.920
We're now recording
for the Horny Student Line.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.560
It's very popular.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.920
Oh, yeah. That feels so good.

16:42.840 --> 16:46.680
I bend over so you can come
inside me with that hard rod…

16:50.000 --> 16:52.080
Okay, well, that was it.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.400
No. I just want to show them upstairs.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.840
-Yes. Come on.
-Yes.

16:59.640 --> 17:00.480
Upstairs?

17:01.600 --> 17:02.960
Yes, I'm coming. Are you?

17:03.040 --> 17:07.040
Just spray it on my back.
Come on. Oh, yeah. Come on.

17:07.120 --> 17:08.760
-Come on.
-Okay, Marly. Stop.

17:09.360 --> 17:11.280
We've got it. Thank you.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.160
UNUSABLE

17:17.240 --> 17:22.200
<i>Well, downstairs we mainly record stories,</i>
<i>but up here, we do the real work.</i>

17:22.280 --> 17:23.160
<i>Okay.</i>

17:29.480 --> 17:31.520
Oh, yeah! Keep going!

17:34.400 --> 17:36.240
Yes!

17:40.000 --> 17:40.840
Yes!

17:42.920 --> 17:43.760
Oh, yes!

17:44.560 --> 17:46.360
Yes!

17:46.880 --> 17:47.760
Jesus.

17:48.280 --> 17:50.400
This is where we record the Orgy Line.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.760
-The Orgy Line?
-Johnny's idea.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.240
<i>Johnny Santini</i>
<i>was one of Frank's clubbing buddies.</i>

17:58.320 --> 18:00.680
<i>He was allowed</i>
<i>to call himself a quarter shareholder</i>

18:00.760 --> 18:03.720
<i>because he had invested</i>
<i>10,000 guilders in the company.</i>

18:04.960 --> 18:07.560
<i>Johnny was the adopted son</i>
<i>of Mario Santini,</i>

18:07.640 --> 18:10.200
<i>from the famous</i>
<i>Amsterdam ice cream parlor, Santini's,</i>

18:10.280 --> 18:12.800
<i>and lived by</i>
<i>his father's three golden rules.</i>

18:12.880 --> 18:13.720
One…

18:14.600 --> 18:16.520
<i>One: you close in winter.</i>

18:16.600 --> 18:17.560
Two…

18:17.640 --> 18:20.600
<i>Two: you don't sell sandwiches. And three:</i>

18:20.680 --> 18:23.320
There's no such thing as yogurt gelato.

18:23.840 --> 18:24.680
Bravo.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.160
-Hey.
-Hey. That face of yours.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.920
<i>At that time, there was only one bar</i>
<i>you went to if you wanted to be seen.</i>

18:32.000 --> 18:33.320
-Hey.
-Enjoy.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.320
Yes, nice man. Yes. Right away…

18:35.400 --> 18:36.240
't Rijk.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.360
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.320
<i>The Teledutch guys went there every day.</i>

18:44.400 --> 18:45.400
Tsjibbe.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.000
A bottle of ice-cold chablis, please.
We're celebrating.

18:49.080 --> 18:52.000
-You're celebrating every day.
-I know.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.800
Just add a dozen oysters to that.
You'll never guess what we did.

18:57.840 --> 19:01.920
<i>Tsjibbe Veenstra, the owner,</i>
<i>was the first to be given the opportunity</i>

19:02.000 --> 19:04.720
<i>to invest in Teledutch six months ago.</i>

19:04.800 --> 19:06.160
-Okay.
-Yes.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.040
So I call an 06 number.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.160
-Yes.
-And then?

19:09.240 --> 19:12.880
Then you get to hear a tape
with a female voice on it.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.760
-And panting…
-And I can order that girl?

19:15.840 --> 19:18.280
No, because it's a tape. Do you get it?

19:18.360 --> 19:20.720
It's a recording of people banging.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.040
Why would I want to listen to that?
I'd rather do it myself, wouldn't I?

19:24.120 --> 19:26.680
You work in a bar
and have someone to bang every day.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.560
Think about the average man.
Why do people watch porn?

19:29.640 --> 19:30.680
-Yes.
-Yes.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.160
Yes, but then
you've got something to look at.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.680
I'm not going to pay 50 cents
per minute to jerk myself off.

19:36.760 --> 19:37.960
I can do that for free.

19:38.040 --> 19:41.200
I think there are a lot of men
who get excited

19:41.280 --> 19:43.440
when they can listen
to a woman while doing it.

19:43.960 --> 19:44.800
Yes.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.360
-Yes.
-Yes.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.240
But you can't talk to the chick?

19:51.320 --> 19:54.760
No. All those men are listening
to the same recording at the same time.

19:54.840 --> 19:56.200
Do you get it? It's big money.

19:56.720 --> 20:00.560
If you put in 10,000 guilders now,
you get 25 percent of the shares.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.200
It'll be doubled within a month.
Do it for me.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.120
Shit idea.

20:06.760 --> 20:07.920
This is nice too.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.920
-Yes.
-You have a beautiful place.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.080
-It'll still be here in a year.
-Look at this.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.960
Yes. New watch? So what?

20:14.040 --> 20:16.840
No. Take a look. See that second hand?

20:16.920 --> 20:19.720
-Ping.
-Yeah?

20:19.800 --> 20:22.800
Another guilder.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.720
-Another guilder.
-Yes, great.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.520
Pretty good idea actually, isn't it?
The Orgy Line.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.760
-I think it's a shit idea.
-You have to admit, it was a nice stunt.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.760
The cameraman had a bulge in his pants.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.280
We should present ourselves as
a professional telecommunications company.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.200
Not as some second-rate whorehouse.

20:43.280 --> 20:47.400
-It's called free publicity, Ramon.
-Do you think the PTT agrees?

20:47.480 --> 20:50.240
So long as they're taking 90%,
they won't do a thing.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.320
The PTT is a state-owned company.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.160
A lot is allowed
as long as they don't see it.

20:56.520 --> 20:59.160
They'll soon be giving our license
to a more respectable company.

21:00.680 --> 21:02.720
I'll ask them to cut that bit out.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.640
Thank you.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.240
No chance, Frank.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.880
That's Robine van Eeghen.
She's not into tramps.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.360
You're a tramp yourself.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.960
I'm respectably married.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.280
Jan?

22:14.880 --> 22:15.920
How much is this?

22:16.400 --> 22:19.320
-Oh, just take it. No one will notice.
-Okay.

22:19.400 --> 22:23.160
I'm curious about those lectures
by Paulus the Wood Gnome.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.800
Did you know that women

22:24.880 --> 22:28.200
can have an orgasm
from visual stimulation alone?

22:28.280 --> 22:29.360
No comment.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.320
You're such a prude.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.200
I'm not a prude.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.600
Okay, I'll admit, I'm a prude.

22:41.320 --> 22:44.800
In summer, everyone was topless
on the beach except for me.

22:46.880 --> 22:47.760
Hello?

22:49.400 --> 22:50.480
Someone's there.

22:51.920 --> 22:52.760
Hello?

22:57.560 --> 22:58.600
Hello.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.400
Who's there?

23:01.480 --> 23:05.160
I'm looking for a light.
Can you open the door?

23:05.240 --> 23:07.640
That's not a door. That's a cabinet.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.400
-This is a shop.
-That explains it.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.240
Hi.

23:17.880 --> 23:20.080
I… Do you have a flashlight?

23:20.160 --> 23:21.960
I want to take a look around.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.960
There are flashlights up there.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.880
-How did you get there?
-Through the window.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.040
That's called breaking in.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.040
It's empty.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.600
Are you going to squat?

23:34.120 --> 23:35.960
Maybe. That depends.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.480
Hi.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.680
Hi.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.400
Thank you. I'll bring it back.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.280
Goddamn it. Wow.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.280
Holy shit.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.200
Look at this.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.760
The universe is trying
to tell you something, huh?

24:08.480 --> 24:09.320
What?

24:10.640 --> 24:12.600
"One hour of Tyrol sexual pleasure"?

24:29.560 --> 24:30.960
Yes. Found it.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.800
Welcome to club RoXY.
You're the first guests.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.280
What's club RoXY?

24:45.760 --> 24:47.680
The hottest nightclub in Amsterdam.

24:47.760 --> 24:52.360
<i>Mischa was a DJ when the profession</i>
<i>meant nothing and paid even less.</i>

24:53.400 --> 24:55.480
<i>He'd been dreaming</i>
<i>of his own club for years</i>

24:55.560 --> 24:58.200
<i>to turn the Amsterdam nightlife</i>
<i>upside down.</i>

24:58.720 --> 25:01.600
<i>And this abandoned sex theater</i>
<i>is just what he was looking for.</i>

25:03.200 --> 25:06.200
Oh, Franz. No, don't touch me. 

25:06.280 --> 25:10.120
Heidi, your breasts are so big.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.600
Oh yes, Franz.

25:12.680 --> 25:13.720
Mar, your turn.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.800
No, you guys go ahead.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.040
Oh, Franzi.

25:18.120 --> 25:19.840
What's "dick" in German?

25:22.960 --> 25:24.280
Franz Schwanz.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.680
Where's your dick? I want to see it.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.640
I'm leaving.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.760
I need your dick. Where is--

25:33.840 --> 25:35.040
Don't you need to go too?

25:35.120 --> 25:38.560
-They'll be stripping that store bare.
-It's all old stuff.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.400
Heidi.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.200
Yes, Franzi.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.480
It's hiding.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.480
Okay, bye.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.960
-Bye.
-Bye. Heidi.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.360
-Oh, Franz. Franzi.
-Stand up, please.

25:52.920 --> 25:54.760
Oh, Franzi. Come…

25:54.840 --> 25:58.080
<i>It wasn't just that bizarre porn movie</i>
<i>that made me clamp up.</i>

25:58.840 --> 26:01.560
<i>It actually happened</i>
<i>every time I saw a nice boy.</i>

26:02.600 --> 26:05.080
<i>Why couldn't I be as free as Janna?</i>

26:05.160 --> 26:07.080
HALL

26:13.600 --> 26:14.520
Where's Janna?

26:14.600 --> 26:15.960
Asleep.

26:18.280 --> 26:20.280
She was with some DJ all night.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.560
You don't want to know
how much noise they made.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.240
And I'm not just talking about the music.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.640
-Good morning, everyone.
-Good morning.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.200
Who's that?

26:43.360 --> 26:44.680
What do we see here?

26:51.120 --> 26:52.080
A cunt.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.200
Exactly. A cunt.

26:56.320 --> 26:59.320
If there's one thing
that's important in sexology,

26:59.400 --> 27:01.760
it's that we call things by their names.

27:02.760 --> 27:06.280
My name is Leon DeWolff,
and I'm replacing Professor Van Beuren,

27:06.360 --> 27:09.560
who is unable to continue this term
due to private circumstances.

27:09.640 --> 27:14.240
I would love
to give him a sexology lesson.

27:15.880 --> 27:20.200
Why is a subject
that is such a natural part of life

27:20.280 --> 27:22.880
surrounded by so much shame?

27:24.760 --> 27:27.200
<i>No one had ever told me about sex.</i>

27:28.400 --> 27:29.600
<i>Why we do it,</i>

27:30.120 --> 27:31.560
<i>why we crave it,</i>

27:32.120 --> 27:34.720
<i>and why it's so difficult to talk about.</i>

27:34.800 --> 27:35.840
SEXUALITY

27:35.920 --> 27:38.880
<i>The subject had been kept from me</i>
<i>as if it were harmful.</i>

27:38.960 --> 27:40.120
SEX

27:43.960 --> 27:48.280
<i>And according to my mother,</i>
<i>it served only one purpose: reproduction.</i>

27:48.360 --> 27:52.920
So Ramon is giving her a CD player.
I find that quite unromantic.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.640
Kind of like
he's giving himself a present.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.800
Why not give Natas something she likes?

27:58.880 --> 28:01.000
Earrings or a weekend in Paris
or something.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.040
Ramon is asking us all to give her CDs

28:06.120 --> 28:10.080
and I still wonder,
does he want us to buy brand-new CDs

28:10.680 --> 28:13.560
or to give her ones
they already have on record?

28:13.640 --> 28:16.200
Will they still use their record player?

28:16.280 --> 28:17.960
No, don't come yet, babe.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.800
-It's not the right position.
-Yes.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.440
You bought the Prince CD, right?

28:23.520 --> 28:26.840
What if we also give them tickets
to that concert in Antwerp?

28:26.920 --> 28:30.240
We can make it
a fun weekend with the four of us.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.920
I mean,
money's not an issue anymore, is it?

28:36.280 --> 28:38.440
-Oh, that was nice.
-Good, honey.

28:50.880 --> 28:54.160
-Are you doing gymnastics now?
-Yes, otherwise it'll leak out.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.440
Did they say anything about your speed?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.720
-Who?
-At the clinic.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.560
<i>Anouk had told Frank</i>
<i>to go to the fertility clinic</i>

29:05.640 --> 29:07.240
<i>to get tested.</i>

29:07.320 --> 29:11.560
<i>Not that he really wanted to be a father.</i>
<i>That was more an obsession of hers.</i>

29:11.640 --> 29:12.480
Mr. Caan?

29:12.560 --> 29:14.040
Room three.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.320
<i>Frank had an entirely different obsession.</i>

29:19.840 --> 29:23.880
<i>His whole life</i>
<i>was one big quest for success.</i>

29:30.600 --> 29:32.280
<i>First, it was sneakers.</i>

29:35.120 --> 29:36.600
<i>Then it was the Lolo ball.</i>

29:36.680 --> 29:37.960
BUY ONE GET FIVE

29:38.040 --> 29:41.880
<i>But the Philips Video2000 recorder</i>
<i>was going to be the next big thing.</i>

29:41.960 --> 29:44.200
…is the best video recorder in existence.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.920
But this has something special:
this symbol. See?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.240
DTF. That stands for
Dynamic Track Following.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.280
So if you pause or fast forward,

29:51.360 --> 29:55.200
you won't get those annoying track marks
that you do with VHS and Betamax.

29:55.280 --> 29:59.880
I'll give you ten percent off
and you get two free Video2000 cassettes.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.720
Will porn be released on that?

30:02.520 --> 30:03.360
Porn?

30:05.440 --> 30:09.720
<i>Today, Phillips has stopped</i> <i>production</i>
<i>of the Video2000 recorder,</i>

30:09.800 --> 30:13.520
<i>so it seems that VHS</i>
<i>has won the battle for the video consumer.</i>

30:19.400 --> 30:22.880
<i>Mr. Stigter?</i>

30:23.760 --> 30:25.000
Mr. Stigter?

30:25.080 --> 30:26.840
Yes, that's me.

30:26.920 --> 30:27.920
Room one.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.800
NAME: FRANK STIGTER

31:22.040 --> 31:22.920
Come on.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.120
Fucking VHS.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.600
PTT STARTS PAY LINES

31:47.400 --> 31:52.160
PTT STARTS TELEPHONE PAY LINES

31:54.880 --> 31:58.360
<i>The idea that would finally</i>
<i>make him a fortune was born.</i>

31:58.440 --> 32:01.440
-No luck?
-Get some decent equipment first.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.120
<i>What did they say about your sperm?</i>

32:04.640 --> 32:07.920
Best sperm in the world.
They'd never seen anything like it.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.400
The sperm bank even specially requested

32:11.480 --> 32:12.800
for me to be a donor.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.240
Frank.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.000
It was okay. Yes, just…

32:19.960 --> 32:20.840
All okay.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.720
Hey.

32:35.600 --> 32:36.440
Yes.

32:40.400 --> 32:41.320
Hi.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.360
-Hey.
-Hello.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.680
How are you?

32:49.760 --> 32:50.920
-All okay? Yeah?
-Good.

32:51.440 --> 32:52.880
Hey, Frank. Everything okay?

32:53.720 --> 32:55.640
-Everything okay?
-Very nice.

32:55.720 --> 32:56.560
Sugar?

33:02.240 --> 33:05.120
That's so sweet of you. Ramon, look.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.240
-Another CD.
-Yes.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.240
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.400
-Get yourself a drink.
-Will do.

33:12.480 --> 33:14.160
-Hello.
-Hey.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.360
-Hi. Thank you.
-Happy birthday, darling.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.480
-Thank you.
-Come to your aunt.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.600
-Go to Aunt Anouk.
-You're so big.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.160
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.800
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

33:26.880 --> 33:29.160
Well. What could that be? Ramon.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.280
Look.

33:39.840 --> 33:40.800
Nice.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.480
You are absolutely insane.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.240
-How beautiful.
-Here. Look.

33:47.480 --> 33:49.480
From you? How sweet.

33:50.360 --> 33:53.040
-Thank you. How sweet.
-Yes.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.640
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you. Thanks.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.120
How's it going?

34:01.080 --> 34:02.120
Hey, nice.

34:02.200 --> 34:03.120
Chardonnay?

34:03.640 --> 34:04.840
No, I'll have juice.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.480
No. I'm ovulating today.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.200
That's why you were so late.

34:15.200 --> 34:19.920
Enjoy. When you eventually have kids,
you won't have the energy.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.040
I hope so.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.840
Shit, I'm so nervous.

34:24.120 --> 34:26.560
-Oh, yes.
-Shall we just put it on?

34:27.360 --> 34:28.960
I don't want to miss it.

34:29.040 --> 34:32.120
-Is everything okay between you and Ramon?
-Yes. Absolutely.

34:32.200 --> 34:33.680
All hunky dory.

34:35.120 --> 34:37.720
-Why? How's everything with you?
-Very good.

34:38.800 --> 34:42.440
I just get things stuck in my head
sometimes, with the business and all.

34:42.520 --> 34:46.000
I know it's all fake, but they're
always in there with those girls.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.560
Well, I'm fine in that regard.

34:49.200 --> 34:51.960
Ramon only gets turned on
by things with a plug.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.320
I…

34:54.400 --> 34:56.000
I'm gonna be on <i>TROS Aktua.</i>

34:57.000 --> 34:57.840
Yes.

34:57.920 --> 35:00.720
Not on Natas' birthday. I'll record it.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.000
-Don't be stupid.
-I'll record it.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.400
Of course we'll watch it.

35:07.600 --> 35:11.160
<i>Telephone sex is becoming</i>
<i>increasingly popular in the Netherlands…</i>

35:12.600 --> 35:15.080
This is good, yes. Now here's me.

35:15.160 --> 35:18.440
<i>…of special sex lines,</i>
<i>and there are more and more.</i>

35:19.520 --> 35:21.920
<i>The 06 lines, as they are called,</i>

35:22.000 --> 35:25.000
<i>instantly light up in red.</i>

35:25.520 --> 35:27.600
<i>Ah, I'm coming!</i>

35:29.280 --> 35:31.360
<i>It's all about libido.</i>

35:32.480 --> 35:35.440
<i>Men are always up for sex.</i>

35:37.800 --> 35:40.960
<i>This is simple biology.</i>
<i>It's one egg per month versus</i>

35:41.040 --> 35:44.160
<i>billions of sperm cells.</i>
<i>Women simply can't keep up.</i>

35:45.760 --> 35:48.120
<i>And 90% of the income goes to the PTT.</i>

35:48.720 --> 35:53.240
<i>But that means it goes to every taxpayer.</i>
<i>The Netherlands jerks itself rich.</i>

35:56.400 --> 35:57.480
That's a good joke.

35:58.280 --> 36:02.880
<i>Well, downstairs we mainly record stories,</i>
<i>but up here, we do the real work.</i>

36:17.200 --> 36:21.960
<i>The Netherlands is the first country</i>
<i>where paid sex lines gain a foothold.</i>

36:23.400 --> 36:27.600
<i>What a great way to earn extra income</i>
<i>for this diligent student.</i>

36:35.240 --> 36:37.640
We'll never be able
to show our faces again.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.960
You said
you weren't having real sex there!

36:49.040 --> 36:52.320
Stop it.
That whole recording was Johnny's joke.

36:52.400 --> 36:56.800
-There is no Orgy Line. It's fake.
-Then where did the women come from?

36:56.880 --> 36:58.520
Babe, I don't know those chicks.

36:59.280 --> 37:02.280
Believe me, no one has sex
in our office. And even if they did,

37:02.360 --> 37:04.760
with the amount we're at it,
I wouldn't be able to.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.240
Chill. Those are expensive.

37:09.320 --> 37:12.080
Probably not as expensive
as Natasja's bracelet!

37:12.160 --> 37:13.640
That's enough, damn it!

37:16.520 --> 37:17.440
That's enough.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.200
Anouk. You really have to cut it out.

37:24.760 --> 37:28.240
Hey. Natas and I,
that was a long time ago.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.000
-No, you still want her back.
-No, Poekie. I don't.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.400
-Well.
-I want you. Hey.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.600
I only want you.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.920
Come on.

37:44.040 --> 37:44.880
Hey.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.640
Look. I only want you.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.080

38:24.920 --> 38:27.640
Sorry, but I don't think
you can sleep over tonight.

38:46.920 --> 38:48.240
This is "house."

38:49.080 --> 38:52.320
It's the next big thing.
According to Mischa.

38:52.840 --> 38:54.560
No. Surely not.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.720
Hey, DJ. What kind of crap is this?

38:58.320 --> 38:59.880
Okay, let's go.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.240
I like it, actually.

39:04.880 --> 39:06.880
-Sorry, what?
-I quite like it.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.520
No…

39:19.560 --> 39:20.720
Alright.

39:41.560 --> 39:44.560
-It was a good party, wasn't it?
-Yes, a great party.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.080
Can you hear that?

39:56.840 --> 39:59.600
Crystal clear. Not a scratch.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.000
Hey. Sorry.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.680
-Tomorrow, I'll buy you a real present.
-Yeah?

40:11.760 --> 40:12.600
Yeah.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.920
What are you thinking?

40:16.040 --> 40:19.200
Such a beautiful CD player
naturally requires beautiful speakers.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.120
No.

40:21.160 --> 40:22.520
No.

40:23.640 --> 40:24.480
No.

40:25.560 --> 40:30.640
No.

40:30.720 --> 40:35.000
You're going to buy me something
that doesn't need to be plugged in.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.360
And no batteries either.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.760
Not even little penlight batteries?

40:41.320 --> 40:43.280
No. I want to go away for a weekend.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.040
With you, in a nice hotel

40:46.120 --> 40:47.560
with no children.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.880
Sounds more like a good present for me.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.680
No. I'm going
to make you work really hard.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.720
Ow, Natas.

42:04.160 --> 42:07.280
-I hope you're proud of yourself.
-You scared me to death.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.840
What is it? I went dancing, I told you.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.000
I thought I raised a decent girl.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.800
Disgrace. You're a disgrace.

42:16.480 --> 42:19.480
-What is it?
-Grandma rang. "Is that our Marly?"

42:20.080 --> 42:21.680
-Everyone's seen it.
-What?

42:21.760 --> 42:23.800
-Did you think about my work?
-Seen what?

42:23.880 --> 42:26.040
I have to show up at City Hall on Monday.

42:26.120 --> 42:28.480
I'm going crazy here.
What have I done, Mom?

42:30.040 --> 42:32.080
-You were on TV.
-On TV?

42:33.280 --> 42:35.600
-Why was I on TV?
-You can't deny it.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.840
I saw it myself. Everyone saw it.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.960
Recording dirty tapes.
Is that the example I set for you?

42:44.320 --> 42:45.680
Why was that on TV?

42:46.960 --> 42:50.400
Mom, I went there once.
I thought it was awful.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.920
If this is how you want to make a living,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.880
you better pack your things.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.400
Joyce.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.600
-What?
-You wanted to move out so badly.

42:59.600 --> 43:00.440
Go then.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.520
I don't want to see you here again.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.560
Dad?

43:12.120 --> 43:12.960
Daddy.

<i>All the lines are down.</i>

43:48.080 --> 43:48.920
What do you mean?

43:49.000 --> 43:52.600

I can't call any of the 06 lines either.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.520
<i>The PTT has cut us off.</i>

43:54.600 --> 43:55.880

<i>Telephone sex is becoming</i>
<i>increasingly popular in the Netherlands.</i>

<i>of special sex lines</i>

<i>turned into a blaze that caused</i>

<i>And all because so many men that evening</i>

<i>were all jerking off</i>
<i>at the same time while on the line.</i>

44:50.600 --> 44:55.280
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>Teledutch's lines were closed immediately.</i>

44:55.360 --> 44:57.960
What do I care
about that stupid submarine, man?

44:59.080 --> 45:01.760
Have you ever heard

Capitalism is winning.

45:04.480 --> 45:08.040
But only if we make money. Lots of money!

45:20.120 --> 45:22.840
<i>I'd imagined it all a little differently,</i>

45:23.360 --> 45:27.000
<i>but my new life in the big city</i>
<i>could finally begin.</i>

45:34.400 --> 45:36.760
-Hey.
-I'm looking for a room.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.880
<i>Teledutch was down.</i>

45:39.960 --> 45:43.320
<i>If it were up to me,</i>
<i>I'd have nothing to do with it ever again.</i>

45:44.040 --> 45:46.640
Good afternoon.
You're speaking to Anouk Stigter.

45:46.720 --> 45:50.360
My husband had his sperm tested
with you a few months ago.

45:50.440 --> 45:52.080
I had a question about the results.

45:52.160 --> 45:55.160
-<i>What was the name again?</i>
-Stigter. Frank Stigter.

45:55.240 --> 45:58.000
-<i>One moment, please.</i>
-Sure, I'll wait.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.520
<i>But as Frank would soon discover,</i>

46:02.600 --> 46:06.480
<i>one simple phone call</i>
<i>can change your whole life.</i>

46:07.640 --> 46:10.040
<i>We have no records of Mr. Stigter's semen.</i>

46:10.120 --> 46:11.560
What do you mean?

46:11.640 --> 46:14.720
<i>He came here,</i>
<i>but he didn't leave a sample.</i>

48:31.560 --> 48:33.240
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

48:34.720 --> 48:36.200
<i>Oh, that's so good.</i>

48:39.400 --> 48:40.640
<i>Go on.</i>

48:46.000 --> 48:46.920
<i>Yeah.</i>

48:47.960 --> 48:49.240
<i>That's so hot.</i>

48:49.320 --> 48:50.640
<i>Oh, deeper.</i>

48:51.400 --> 48:52.480
<i>So good.</i>

48:53.240 --> 48:54.720
<i>Yeah!</i>

48:59.200 --> 49:00.320
<i>I'm coming.</i>

49:00.400 --> 49:03.280
