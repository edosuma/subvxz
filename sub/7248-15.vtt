WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.711
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

00:03.753 --> 00:06.130
I want to know
why you won't paint this place.

00:06.214 --> 00:10.551
It's a pain. I'd have to close the place,
which I can't afford, or paint it at night...

00:10.635 --> 00:13.512
which I don't want to do
because I hate painting.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.847
How about this?

00:14.930 --> 00:16.639
I'll help you. I love to paint.

00:16.724 --> 00:19.143
I guess maybe, if I had help.

00:19.935 --> 00:23.021
- He's so cute. What's his name?
- Case Study Number 12.

00:23.105 --> 00:24.314
Show yourself.

00:24.398 --> 00:27.192
Molt or chirp or something.

00:27.609 --> 00:29.068
This is so not funny.

00:29.611 --> 00:33.322
Luke, Stella got out.
Could you come over and help me?

00:33.407 --> 00:34.491
I'll be right over.

00:34.574 --> 00:36.742
Out of all the people
you could have called...

00:36.785 --> 00:40.204
that would have come and dropped
what they were doing, you called Luke.

00:40.288 --> 00:42.248
Do you have feelings for this man?

00:42.332 --> 00:43.416
Maybe I do.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.460
- Don't you meet your folks on Friday?
- Yes.

00:45.543 --> 00:48.295
But I can get out early
for a special occasion.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.173
- Friday it is.
- Good.

00:53.885 --> 00:54.927
Dad!

00:57.930 --> 01:01.016
On the way, I thought I'd stop by
and surprise the Gilmore Girls.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.142
Are you surprised?

01:02.226 --> 01:04.227
The teeniest feather could knock me out.

01:04.312 --> 01:06.689
Where would somebody find
a place to stay here?

01:06.772 --> 01:08.899
- You're staying?
- I'm thinking about it.

01:08.983 --> 01:11.360
- Stay with us.
- Why not stay with us for a few days?

01:11.444 --> 01:13.112
Thanks. You won't even know I'm there.

01:13.195 --> 01:14.362
Hey, hop on.

01:16.991 --> 01:18.242
Christopher.

01:26.917 --> 01:29.210
- He looks good, don't you think?
- He looks good.

01:29.294 --> 01:31.421
- I like his hair shorter.
- Shorter's nice.

01:31.505 --> 01:33.882
- Do you think he'll stay long?
- Wouldn't bet on it.

01:33.965 --> 01:35.841
Maybe we make him stay
a couple of weeks.

01:35.926 --> 01:38.553
Absolutely, by weighting
him down with blankets.

01:38.637 --> 01:40.221
I just want him to be comfortable.

01:40.305 --> 01:42.473
He's gonna come and go
as he pleases, babe.

01:42.515 --> 01:45.643
- I know.
- No amount of bedding will change that.

01:45.810 --> 01:47.770
But he's never been
to Stars Hollow before.

01:47.854 --> 01:48.854
I know.

01:48.938 --> 01:51.648
That means something's
gotta be different, right?

01:51.733 --> 01:55.027
Why don't you just enjoy
the time you've got, okay?

01:55.862 --> 01:57.196
Yeah, okay.

02:00.116 --> 02:02.117
I still think something's different though.

02:02.201 --> 02:04.870
That is the worst shower I've ever had.

02:04.954 --> 02:07.456
Water pressure keeps changing
every two seconds.

02:07.540 --> 02:08.999
I'm fixing it tomorrow.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.251
You stay away from my shower.

02:11.335 --> 02:13.503
We ordered Chinese food.
It should be here soon.

02:13.545 --> 02:15.588
- Good, I'm starving.
- Here.

02:17.257 --> 02:18.716
How is Diane?

02:19.426 --> 02:21.302
Diane is ancient history.

02:21.386 --> 02:24.138
When I met her at Easter,
you said she could be the one.

02:24.222 --> 02:26.265
The one to be gone by Memorial Day.

02:26.350 --> 02:28.310
- You're worse than Mom.
- Low blow.

02:28.393 --> 02:32.021
- Can't keep a fella happy?
- I keep them very happy.

02:32.063 --> 02:34.523
- Okay, don't get gross.
- You're upsetting us.

02:34.566 --> 02:36.442
I'm gonna go study
before the food arrives.

02:36.526 --> 02:38.486
- What? Tomorrow's Saturday.
- I know.

02:38.570 --> 02:41.364
I like to get my weekend homework done
by Saturday night...

02:41.406 --> 02:44.408
so then I can do extra-credit stuff
on Sunday.

02:46.244 --> 02:47.870
Don't look at me.

02:49.747 --> 02:51.373
She's a great kid.

02:51.582 --> 02:53.750
I wish I could say
I saw more of myself in her...

02:53.835 --> 02:55.711
other than we have similar left earlobes...

02:55.795 --> 02:59.006
but she's all you.
Chip off the old perfect block.

02:59.090 --> 03:00.382
Why the hell are you here?

03:00.466 --> 03:03.343
- Behold the queen of the subtle transition.
- Why are you here?

03:03.427 --> 03:06.304
You're gonna force me
to lawyer up, Officer.

03:06.805 --> 03:08.640
Okay, look...

03:09.266 --> 03:11.559
I've been making changes,
especially in my career...

03:11.643 --> 03:13.227
and I've got all my ducks in a row.

03:13.312 --> 03:14.771
You're opening a shooting gallery.

03:14.855 --> 03:18.358
- I was tying up the loose ends of my life.
- Do they make that much string?

03:18.442 --> 03:21.069
You've always had that quick mind.
It's annoying.

03:21.111 --> 03:22.779
So you've been tying up loose ends.

03:22.863 --> 03:24.572
I don't know what your dad told you...

03:24.614 --> 03:27.366
but I'm on the verge
of a big success. It's for real.

03:27.450 --> 03:29.577
I've got a company with actual cash flow.

03:29.661 --> 03:32.997
I've got employees.
I've got an accountant, for God's sake.

03:33.081 --> 03:36.417
He wears a tie and says words
like 'fiduciary' and 'ironically. '

03:36.459 --> 03:40.004
- It's for real this time.
- I would love to believe it is.

03:41.464 --> 03:44.508
Why does your dad
have more faith in me than you?

03:44.592 --> 03:47.678
My father hit his head surfing Rincon
a couple of years ago.

03:47.762 --> 03:50.472
- His judgment's a little off.
- So you have zero faith?

03:50.556 --> 03:52.224
I've known you since I was six.

03:52.308 --> 03:54.351
You're that guy
who crashed his new Porsche...

03:54.435 --> 03:56.937
two hours after he got it
on his sixteenth birthday.

03:57.021 --> 03:59.815
You were the girl
in the Pinky Tuscadero T-shirt next to me.

03:59.899 --> 04:01.108
- Horrified.
- Think again.

04:01.150 --> 04:03.860
- All right. Having a blast, then horrified.
- Listen to me.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.404
I am. Your life is back on track,
that's great...

04:06.488 --> 04:09.240
and I appreciate you coming here
for the very first time...

04:09.324 --> 04:10.700
might I add, to tell us that.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.828
- I didn't come here just to tell you that.
- No?

04:16.623 --> 04:19.875
There's some things I need to do,
to take care of.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.253
Like?

04:22.712 --> 04:25.631
I haven't been enough a part of Rory's life.

04:26.925 --> 04:30.428
So I wanna be around more,
to be another pal she can depend on.

04:30.512 --> 04:33.556
I'm not crazy. I know there's already
a life going on here...

04:33.640 --> 04:36.809
and God knows she doesn't need
anyone besides you.

04:38.019 --> 04:39.728
But if you give me a chance...

04:39.812 --> 04:41.813
I've always had the door
to Rory open for you.

04:41.898 --> 04:43.733
- I know.
- You've hardly ever used it.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.567
I wanna use it now.

04:46.485 --> 04:48.820
- Is that okay?
- Of course it is.

04:50.865 --> 04:51.991
Good.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.953
I forgot to ask you. Tomorrow morning,
I'm going to a softball game.

04:56.036 --> 04:58.663
- Do you wanna come?
- You play softball?

04:59.540 --> 05:00.582
No.

05:01.250 --> 05:03.877
- 'You play softball?' That's good.
- Okay.

05:03.961 --> 05:06.296
- Whose game is it?
- It's my friend Dean's.

05:06.380 --> 05:09.007
- Dean?
- Yeah, it starts at 9:00.

05:09.967 --> 05:11.635
Sure, it's a date.

05:14.137 --> 05:16.347
- She has a Dean?
- She has a Dean.

05:16.431 --> 05:17.849
How did this happen?

05:17.891 --> 05:20.810
A single-celled organism
crawled out of the primordial ooze...

05:20.894 --> 05:23.271
and that pretty much led to Dean.

05:24.147 --> 05:25.648
I need a beer.

05:28.443 --> 05:29.777
Yes, dear?

05:31.362 --> 05:34.698
There's a lot more
than an earlobe resemblance there.

05:35.658 --> 05:38.660
Good. Thanks for the door thing.

05:39.745 --> 05:41.621
Thanks for wanting it.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.074

06:47.978 --> 06:50.271
You got the next one, don't worry about it.

06:50.356 --> 06:52.816
- So, which is your Dean?
- That's him over there.

06:52.900 --> 06:54.735
Okay, we got two down.

06:55.194 --> 06:57.279
- That's Luke.
- Luke's the diner guy?

06:57.362 --> 07:00.114
Yes, we eat there practically every day.

07:00.782 --> 07:03.826
Looks like we got out Number Three
coming to the plate, guys.

07:03.910 --> 07:06.537
I'd send your boys a little farther
into the field, Luke.

07:06.621 --> 07:09.623
Why? Will they have
a better view of you whiffing?

07:09.708 --> 07:13.294
The only way I'm not hitting it
is if you don't get it over the plate.

07:13.378 --> 07:17.632
The truth of the matter is that
you can't pitch and you can't hit.

07:17.674 --> 07:19.467
So this'll be a terrific matchup.

07:19.509 --> 07:22.053
- Knock it off, Kirk.
- A historic lack of action.

07:22.136 --> 07:24.179
Don't you have anything better to do?

07:24.263 --> 07:26.431
What can I say, I'm addicted to comedy.

07:26.516 --> 07:29.602
Half an hour they've been playing,
and it's tied zero-zero.

07:29.685 --> 07:32.395
If you take this show on the road,
I've got a name for you.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.941
Zero and Zero.
Dean Zero and Luke Zero, get it?

07:36.233 --> 07:39.778
- Doesn't even resemble clever.
- I'm dumbing it down for you, Alfalfa.

07:39.862 --> 07:42.948
- How long do these games last?
- Till they get tired.

07:43.032 --> 07:45.325
Then they say
the first team to get a run wins.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.660
Yeah, it's really professional down there.

07:47.703 --> 07:50.080
Luke, does your husband
play softball, too?

07:50.164 --> 07:51.957
All right, that's it.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.293
I'm getting a page. I've gotta go.

08:01.675 --> 08:03.968
Dean, this is my dad. Dad, this is Dean.

08:04.386 --> 08:06.179
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

08:06.304 --> 08:08.180
So, do you live in the area?

08:08.264 --> 08:11.016
No, I had some time,
so I rode my bike out from Berkeley.

08:11.101 --> 08:12.644
Really? What do you got?

08:12.727 --> 08:15.229
- A 2000 Indian.
- I got an '86 Suzuki.

08:15.313 --> 08:16.522
- Nice.
- Yeah.

08:16.606 --> 08:18.107
Dean, come on!

08:18.566 --> 08:22.027
I gotta go. I'll see you later.
It was nice meeting you.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.827
- So that was a Dean?
- That was a Dean.

08:33.456 --> 08:35.457
Next run wins, all right?

08:36.125 --> 08:37.751
Yeah, all right.

08:48.345 --> 08:50.722
- Wow!
- Wow what?

08:51.098 --> 08:54.976
Wow, I have never seen you two
enjoy a pleasant moment together.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.102
Come on.

08:56.186 --> 08:58.730
You have seen us
enjoy a pleasant moment.

08:58.813 --> 09:01.315
- No, not ever.
- You're being absurd.

09:01.441 --> 09:04.443
You have to admit,
they are few and far between.

09:04.527 --> 09:06.070
Through no fault of mine.

09:06.154 --> 09:09.949
I'm just saying it's refreshing.
It's not the usual'grr,'that's all.

09:10.033 --> 09:13.494
Through no fault of yours?
I'm sorry, but you're the one that's so...

09:13.578 --> 09:14.578
I don't know.

09:14.662 --> 09:17.206
You do know,
or you wouldn't have started saying it.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.583
- Just yourself, caustic.
- You mean obnoxious?

09:19.625 --> 09:22.085
- Your words, not mine.
- Go to hell.

09:22.628 --> 09:26.339
I'm just saying it is refreshing
to see the two of you just...

09:26.424 --> 09:29.260
You, get in here and tell me
about the happenings at home.

09:29.301 --> 09:32.220
I assume you mean,
'Did we get our toaster fixed?'

09:32.304 --> 09:34.597
And no,
it's been cold Pop-Tarts for a week.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.266
It's like a damn Dickens' novel.

09:36.350 --> 09:40.020
I'm not talking about the toaster.
I'm talking about the man.

09:40.104 --> 09:42.981
What's it like having him
around the house all the time?

09:45.442 --> 09:47.193
It's a little weird.

09:47.736 --> 09:50.113
We have fewer clean towels than usual.

09:50.155 --> 09:53.408
Give me something.
Tell me how you feel. I'm dying here.

09:53.491 --> 09:57.077
Honestly, I've been trying to figure out
how this makes me feel...

09:57.120 --> 09:59.664
since he asked me
to take my shirt off the other day.

09:59.748 --> 10:03.751
- Excuse me?
- No, it was a 'hello' kind of thing.

10:03.835 --> 10:06.045
- Wow, he's smooth.
- Yeah.

10:06.129 --> 10:08.965
I've not seen this man
since last Christmas, right?

10:09.007 --> 10:11.259
We hear from him maybe once a week.

10:11.342 --> 10:13.719
Then, all of a sudden,
he's here in my town...

10:13.803 --> 10:16.972
and Rory's running around all excited.
He's sleeping on the couch.

10:17.014 --> 10:19.933
I'm thinking,'Should I be mad?
Should I send him to a hotel?'

10:19.976 --> 10:21.811
But then he smiles...

10:22.061 --> 10:23.896
and it's Christopher.

10:24.980 --> 10:27.816
No matter how many years go by
or how long I don't see him...

10:27.858 --> 10:31.152
whenever I do, it's always Christopher.

10:31.904 --> 10:34.740
- What do I do with this?
- Dunk. Go on.

10:35.991 --> 10:37.992
This man knows all my secrets.

10:38.076 --> 10:41.120
All of my bad-girl moments
happened with him.

10:41.371 --> 10:44.332
My worst fashion choices,
my big-hair days...

10:44.416 --> 10:46.835
wearing the Bonne Bell Lip Smackers
around my neck...

10:46.877 --> 10:48.503
it was all with Christopher.

10:48.587 --> 10:51.006
So, do you think you two will...

10:51.715 --> 10:52.757
No.

10:52.882 --> 10:55.259
- That's convincing.
- I don't know.

10:57.095 --> 10:59.388
He wants to be more involved with Rory.

10:59.472 --> 11:01.849
He wants to spend more time with her
and be a pal.

11:01.933 --> 11:04.226
- It's about time.
- Yeah, that's good.

11:04.310 --> 11:05.477
Yes.

11:05.561 --> 11:07.688
- Lf it's true.
- And if it's not?

11:07.730 --> 11:11.483
Then it's... Christopher.

11:12.568 --> 11:14.736
This is the town flower shop.

11:14.904 --> 11:18.449
Over there is a good pizza place.
That's the stationery store.

11:18.532 --> 11:21.493
- And that's Al's Pancake World.
- Good pancakes?

11:21.577 --> 11:24.162
- He doesn't serve pancakes.
- Okay.

11:24.622 --> 11:27.708
He switched to international cuisine
a couple of years ago...

11:27.791 --> 11:29.292
and dropped the pancakes.

11:29.376 --> 11:32.545
He had already printed a million napkins
with the original name...

11:32.588 --> 11:35.674
- so he just kept it.
- What kind of international cuisine?

11:35.757 --> 11:38.843
He kind of hops around.
Last month, it was his salute to Paraguay.

11:38.927 --> 11:41.220
- Anyone salute back?
- Not really.

11:41.555 --> 11:44.432
Rory, honey.

11:44.766 --> 11:46.976
- How are you, sweetie?
- Great.

11:47.185 --> 11:50.938
- Miss Patty, this is my dad, Christopher.
- Your dad.

11:51.022 --> 11:53.732
- Nice to meet you.
- You're Rory's father.

11:53.817 --> 11:56.152
Well, well, well.

11:56.945 --> 12:00.865
You know, Christopher,
we're all like Rory's parents around here...

12:00.948 --> 12:03.033
and I'm one of her mothers.

12:03.451 --> 12:05.452
And since you're her father...

12:05.536 --> 12:08.747
that would make us... a couple.

12:09.790 --> 12:12.042
Couple of what, I don't know!

12:12.293 --> 12:15.337
- Okay, well, we gotta be going.
- Yes.

12:16.422 --> 12:18.757
- Come back and see me.
- I will.

12:20.175 --> 12:21.259
Bye.

12:30.811 --> 12:32.854
You must be Rory's father.

12:34.439 --> 12:37.775
- Yes, I am.
- Taylor Doose, grocer to Stars Hollow.

12:37.818 --> 12:39.694
Very nice to meet you.

12:40.153 --> 12:43.197
- News travels fast around here.
- Yes, it does.

12:48.203 --> 12:50.163
Bookstore. Good. Come on.

12:54.292 --> 12:56.711
Christopher, Jackson Melville.

12:57.295 --> 12:58.337
Hello.

12:58.421 --> 13:01.215
I gotta tell you,
did they get your description wrong.

13:01.299 --> 13:02.425
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:02.466 --> 13:04.384
Much more George Clooney than Brad Pitt.

13:04.468 --> 13:07.345
Don't you think he's much more
George Clooney than Brad Pitt?

13:07.430 --> 13:09.640
I'm going with
the Billy Crudup comparison myself.

13:09.682 --> 13:11.058
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:11.142 --> 13:14.603
I don't see it.
Maybe from the side. Do you mind?

13:14.687 --> 13:17.481
What? No, not at all.

13:17.690 --> 13:20.067
There's a little Crudup in there.

13:21.151 --> 13:23.486
It's nice to meet you,
whoever you look like.

13:23.529 --> 13:25.405
Nice to meet you, too.

13:26.698 --> 13:29.075
I'm kidnapping you
and getting you out of here.

13:29.159 --> 13:30.326
They all mean well.

13:30.368 --> 13:32.870
I'm sure all lunatics
have the best intentions.

13:32.954 --> 13:35.498
- I hear you like books.
- Why, yes, I do.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.209
I would like you to pick something out
and let me buy it.

13:38.293 --> 13:39.794
You don't have to buy me anything.

13:39.878 --> 13:42.338
Come on, what's the book of your dreams
right now?

13:42.547 --> 13:46.133
That would definitely be
The Compact Oxford English Dictionary...

13:46.175 --> 13:49.636
Excuse me, one Compact
Oxford English Dictionary, please.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.556
Dad, no. It costs a fortune.

13:52.640 --> 13:55.559
You need something
to remember this visit by.

13:57.061 --> 13:59.521
- Here you go.
- Holy mother!

13:59.563 --> 14:01.940
This is the monolith from 2001.

14:02.149 --> 14:04.859
It has every word ever recorded
in the English language...

14:04.902 --> 14:07.070
plus origins and earliest usage.

14:07.154 --> 14:10.573
Wouldn't you rather have a car?
They weigh about the same. Here.

14:10.658 --> 14:12.284
This is so nice of you.

14:12.368 --> 14:15.329
Yeah, I've got a lot of things
to make up for.

14:15.662 --> 14:17.663
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.919
I'm sorry, but your card's been rejected.

14:23.003 --> 14:26.756
- Rejected? What are you talking about?
- I can run it through again if you like.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.841
- Yes.
- No.

14:29.843 --> 14:32.553
He doesn't need to run it through again.

14:33.805 --> 14:36.891
Could you hold that for us?
I'll come back with another card.

14:36.975 --> 14:39.852
- Sure, Chris. No problem.
- Thanks. Come on.

14:46.943 --> 14:51.072
- Now you'll really remember me.
- I didn't want it that much anyway.

14:54.158 --> 14:56.910
Listen, don't tell your mom
about this, okay?

14:56.994 --> 14:58.495
- Okay.
- Thanks.

14:59.121 --> 15:02.082
Yes, it is her real dad. He seems very nice.

15:02.249 --> 15:05.335
Kind of a folkie, poppy,
urban, scruffy look to him.

15:05.419 --> 15:07.379
Obviously there's
some money mixed in there...

15:07.463 --> 15:10.299
because he's got that, you know,
money nose.

15:28.733 --> 15:30.985
- Rory was at the game today.
- Yeah.

15:31.069 --> 15:33.237
- She was with some guy.
- Dean.

15:33.279 --> 15:35.823
No, I know that punk. Some older guy.

15:36.407 --> 15:39.660
- That would've been her dad.
- Really? So that's...

15:40.286 --> 15:43.080
The guy who impregnated me
with Rory, yes.

15:43.664 --> 15:45.248
He did a good job.

15:45.333 --> 15:49.170
- Impregnating me with Rory?
- This has taken a very weird turn.

15:53.257 --> 15:55.133
Hi, where were you?

15:55.176 --> 15:57.469
We saw Al's Paraguayan Pancake House.

15:57.511 --> 16:01.097
We were stalked by townspeople,
and apparently, I look like Billy Crudup.

16:01.181 --> 16:03.766
- You do not.
- Take it up with Jackson.

16:10.065 --> 16:11.065
Hello?

16:12.317 --> 16:13.484
Emily!

16:14.152 --> 16:16.529
- It's your mother.
- Hi, Grandma.

16:19.491 --> 16:22.452
Actually, I'm sitting here with your girls.

16:22.827 --> 16:25.663
Sure. She wants to speak to you.

16:26.456 --> 16:27.456
Hi, Mom.

16:27.540 --> 16:29.917
Lorelai, Christopher is in town.

16:30.335 --> 16:31.794
What? I didn't know.

16:31.836 --> 16:35.798
Coincidentally, I'm sitting across
from an amazing Christopher hologram.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.967
I just had this wonderful idea.

16:38.050 --> 16:39.843
Christopher's parents are in town, too.

16:39.886 --> 16:41.846
You remember Straub and Francine,
don't you?

16:41.929 --> 16:43.847
Yes, the Schnickelfritzes.

16:43.931 --> 16:45.599
- The who?
- The Haydens.

16:45.891 --> 16:48.059
I called them up
and invited them to dinner.

16:48.227 --> 16:51.646
They said that they are free
to join us all on Friday night.

16:51.814 --> 16:53.607
- Join us all?
- Yes.

16:53.691 --> 16:56.068
You, Rory, Christopher, your father.

16:56.151 --> 16:59.070
- That's quite a gathering, Mom.
- I should say so.

16:59.154 --> 17:01.614
We haven't been together
since you both were children.

17:01.698 --> 17:04.659
Straub and Francine haven't seen Rory
since she was a baby.

17:04.701 --> 17:07.954
- Yeah, I know, but...
- It'll be like a wonderful reunion.

17:08.038 --> 17:11.082
All of us together again.
I never thought it would happen.

17:12.125 --> 17:14.126
Yeah. Me either.

17:25.430 --> 17:28.975
I've gotta see my parents.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.186
Ladies and gentlemen,
the drama king and queen of Connecticut.

17:41.737 --> 17:43.488
Hello, anybody home?

17:43.864 --> 17:45.532
Oh, my God, you're here.

17:45.699 --> 17:47.700
Christopher, look at you.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.870
Emily, as always, perfect.

17:49.912 --> 17:52.497
I am so glad to see you.
I didn't hear the doorbell.

17:52.581 --> 17:54.666
We didn't ring the doorbell.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.919
- You let yourselves in?
- It's okay. Look, not a rapist among us.

17:57.961 --> 17:59.045
Hi, Grandma.

17:59.087 --> 18:01.631
- You usually knock.
- Not since you gave us a key.

18:01.715 --> 18:05.510
- That's for emergencies.
- Mom, I'm starving to death.

18:05.594 --> 18:08.263
Is that enough of an emergency for you?

18:08.305 --> 18:12.016
Richard's in the living room.
Come on in. He's dying to see you.

18:12.434 --> 18:16.271
It's a setup, giving me that key. It's meant
to be used. It's my parents' house.

18:16.354 --> 18:17.688
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

18:17.856 --> 18:18.982
Here they are!

18:19.065 --> 18:20.941
- Hi, Grandpa.
- Hello, Rory.

18:20.984 --> 18:23.444
Lorelai. Christopher, old boy, how are you?

18:23.528 --> 18:24.987
My gosh, it's good to see you.

18:25.071 --> 18:27.114
- How are you, Richard?
- Better than most.

18:27.198 --> 18:29.742
- Not as good as some.
- And annoyed with all.

18:29.826 --> 18:31.661
You speak the truth, young man.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.829
I have made martinis.

18:33.955 --> 18:36.874
So, Christopher,
tell me about your business.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.668
Richard, let the poor boy relax.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.421
I simply want to find out how it's going.

18:42.463 --> 18:43.797
It's going great.

18:43.881 --> 18:46.591
I'm afraid to jinx it
by telling you how good it's going.

18:46.634 --> 18:49.511
That is wonderful.
I always knew you had it in you.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.180
You have a splash of greatness,
as my mother would say.

18:52.264 --> 18:54.974
You always had that splash of greatness.

18:55.309 --> 18:58.478
I'd like another splash of greatness
if you don't mind.

18:58.562 --> 19:01.481
Richard, isn't Rory
the spitting image of Christopher?

19:01.565 --> 19:04.943
I just hope you inherit
your father's business sense also, dear.

19:04.985 --> 19:06.111
I know one thing for sure.

19:06.194 --> 19:08.988
You certainly have
your father's musical talent.

19:10.156 --> 19:12.157
- Wait just a minute.
- What?

19:12.242 --> 19:14.619
Neither of these two
have any musical talent.

19:14.661 --> 19:17.330
- I play guitar.
- The opening lick to Smoke On The Water.

19:17.413 --> 19:19.957
And I've mastered the opening lick
to Jumpin' Jack Flash.

19:20.041 --> 19:22.251
I'm a Chuck Berry man myself.

19:24.170 --> 19:25.296
Something wrong?

19:25.379 --> 19:28.965
I'd never have guessed that last sentence
would ever come out of your mouth.

19:29.008 --> 19:30.843
- And why not?
- Chuck Berry?

19:30.885 --> 19:34.179
Yes, Chuck Berry. He was all the rage
when I was in school.

19:34.221 --> 19:38.350
- So we're talking pre My Ding-A-Ling?
- I believe I am.

19:38.517 --> 19:41.019
Do you remember
when the two of you were ten...

19:41.061 --> 19:43.646
and you put on that adorable show for us?

19:43.689 --> 19:44.815
What show, Mom?

19:44.857 --> 19:47.276
Lucy, Schroeder,
you laying on the coffee table.

19:47.359 --> 19:50.570
You pretending it was a piano.
God, why is that remembered?

19:50.654 --> 19:53.031
Because it was
such a wonderful production.

19:53.073 --> 19:56.159
I don't know if it was a production.
It was just one song.

19:56.201 --> 19:58.536
- Suppertime.
- Did you write that?

19:58.578 --> 19:59.912
That was really very good.

19:59.996 --> 20:03.499
Dad, that's from You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown. It's a famous musical.

20:03.541 --> 20:05.626
I thought Christopher
might have written it.

20:05.710 --> 20:07.670
He's a very talented man.

20:08.546 --> 20:11.006
That would be Straub and Francine.

20:11.674 --> 20:12.883
Your turn.

20:12.926 --> 20:15.428
Haven't seen your parents
in quite a number of years.

20:15.511 --> 20:18.096
We were practically inseparable
for a while.

20:18.181 --> 20:19.807
I remember that.

20:20.558 --> 20:21.976
This is weird.

20:22.101 --> 20:24.686
These are my other grandparents.
I don't even know them.

20:24.770 --> 20:27.856
- What do I call them?
- Call them what I call them.

20:28.232 --> 20:29.900
Sorry, my tie's too tight.

20:29.942 --> 20:32.444
Just call them Straub and Francine.

20:32.903 --> 20:35.196
Call them Mr. And Mrs. Hayden.

20:35.406 --> 20:38.492
Sir and ma'am?
Just avoid calling them anything.

20:38.575 --> 20:40.159
Look who's here.

20:40.953 --> 20:44.039
- Hello, Mother, Pop.
- Christopher.

20:44.081 --> 20:45.707
Christopher, hello.

20:45.791 --> 20:47.626
Mr. And Mrs. Hayden, long time no see.

20:47.709 --> 20:51.921
- Lorelai, you look well.
- I am, thanks.

20:52.130 --> 20:54.507
You remember Rory.
You haven't seen her in a while.

20:54.591 --> 20:55.675
No, we haven't.

20:55.759 --> 20:58.219
She was just beginning to speak
in complete sentences.

20:58.303 --> 21:00.346
So not for two years then.

21:02.724 --> 21:04.058
She's been talking a long time.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.228
I was making a humorous comment
sometimes referred to as a joke.

21:07.312 --> 21:10.314
- I see you haven't changed, Lorelai.
- No, not at all.

21:10.398 --> 21:12.691
- Rory, hello.
- Hi.

21:16.112 --> 21:17.947
- Did you just curtsy?
- Shut up.

21:18.030 --> 21:19.156
Sorry, milady.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.785
- Straub, Francine, how about a martini?
- Please.

21:25.496 --> 21:27.247
How is retirement treating you?

21:27.289 --> 21:29.374
Yes, do tell us about the Bahamas.

21:29.458 --> 21:32.836
You can get an entire island there
for the cost of a decent house here.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.046
Really?

21:34.254 --> 21:37.048
How about you?
Any thoughts of retirement on your mind?

21:37.132 --> 21:40.760
Straub, if only you could talk him into it.
I've given up.

21:41.011 --> 21:45.265
We're very pleased about Christopher's
business success out in California.

21:45.307 --> 21:49.394
Yes, it's taken a while, but it seems
to be finally coming together.

21:49.478 --> 21:52.397
- Seems to be.
- Christopher, your tie, please.

21:53.523 --> 21:55.316
Straub and...

21:56.151 --> 21:57.777
Mr. And Mrs...

21:58.194 --> 22:01.572
Are you enjoying your time here...

22:01.948 --> 22:03.449
you two?

22:03.533 --> 22:04.867
That she got from you.

22:04.951 --> 22:07.370
- How old are you, young lady?
- 16.

22:07.453 --> 22:09.162
A dangerous age for girls.

22:09.664 --> 22:13.542
Rory is a very special child.
Excellent student, very bright.

22:13.668 --> 22:17.254
You should have a talk with her.
She could give you a run for your money.

22:17.338 --> 22:19.339
- Is that so?
- That's right.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.016
I think my money is safe.

22:30.100 --> 22:32.143
- I hate President Bush.
- What?

22:32.603 --> 22:34.187
- Oh, boy.
- He's stupid.

22:34.271 --> 22:37.315
His face is too tiny for his head.
I just wanna toss him out.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.026
- That is the leader of our country.
- Ignore her.

22:40.068 --> 22:43.529
'His face is too tiny for his head,'
what kind of a thing is that to say?

22:43.613 --> 22:46.073
I see your daughter's
just as out of control as ever.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.200
Pop, please. Let's try to keep it civil.

22:48.285 --> 22:50.745
What have you been doing
with your life, anyway...

22:50.829 --> 22:53.831
besides hating successful businessmen?
I'm just curious.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.708
Why don't we go to the dining room?

22:56.626 --> 22:59.086
I run an inn near Stars Hollow.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.379
- Really?
- Yes, really.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.756
- Dad, come on.
- Nice to see you found your calling.

23:02.840 --> 23:03.840
Dinner's ready.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.509
- Christopher, your tie.
- Mom, please.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.345
- Is your life all you hoped it would be?
- Yes, it is.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.306
You might not want to take
quite such a haughty tone...

23:11.390 --> 23:14.100
when you announce to the world
that you work in a hotel.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.936
There's nothing wrong with where I work.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.563
Please, I'm getting a headache.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.190
Come on, Richard,
lead us into the dining room now.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.608
If you'd attended university...

23:21.692 --> 23:24.945
as your parents had planned,
and as we had in vain for Christopher...

23:25.029 --> 23:27.781
you might have aspired
to more than a blue-collar position.

23:27.865 --> 23:30.200
- Don't do this.
- I wouldn't give a damn about you...

23:30.242 --> 23:32.952
derailing your own life
if you hadn't swept my son along.

23:33.036 --> 23:35.246
Honey, go in the next room. Go, go.

23:35.622 --> 23:38.708
I'm going to have to echo
Christopher's call for civility here.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.878
A mutual mistake was made
many years ago by these two.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.671
But they've come a long way since.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.591
A mutual mistake?
This whole evening is ridiculous.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.094
We're supposed to sit here
like one big family...

23:49.177 --> 23:51.596
and pretend the damage
that was done is over?

23:51.638 --> 23:54.640
I don't care about how good
a student you say that girl is.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.101
Our son was bound for Princeton.

23:57.143 --> 23:59.937
Every Hayden male attended Princeton,
including myself.

23:59.979 --> 24:02.064
But it all stopped with Christopher.

24:02.106 --> 24:04.316
It's a humiliation we've had to live with...

24:04.400 --> 24:07.611
all because you seduced him
into ruining his life.

24:07.695 --> 24:09.780
She had that baby and ended his future.

24:09.864 --> 24:11.824
- You recant that.
- You're spilling my drink.

24:11.907 --> 24:14.617
- You owe my daughter an apology.
- An apology? That is rich.

24:14.702 --> 24:16.870
- How dare you?
- Richard, what are you doing?

24:16.954 --> 24:19.414
- How dare you insult my daughter!
- Let go of me!

24:19.540 --> 24:20.958
What is going on here?

24:21.041 --> 24:24.335
- Shame on you for opening all this again.
- Get your purse, Francine.

24:24.419 --> 24:26.504
My daughter's very successful
at what she does.

24:26.588 --> 24:29.841
- We're leaving.
- You're not leaving, I'm kicking you out!

24:31.218 --> 24:32.469
Come on.

24:40.393 --> 24:42.895
And you brought up Bush because...

24:43.146 --> 24:45.773
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

24:48.026 --> 24:50.486
I feel 16.

24:58.953 --> 25:00.037
Dad.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.543
Can I get you something to eat?

25:06.669 --> 25:09.171
- I'm not hungry.
- Okay.

25:11.298 --> 25:13.633
Look, thank you.

25:14.510 --> 25:16.261
Thank me? For what?

25:17.137 --> 25:19.180
For what you did in there.

25:19.723 --> 25:23.059
I'm just unbelievably touched
and grateful for what you said to him...

25:23.143 --> 25:25.019
for defending me like that.

25:25.103 --> 25:27.730
I know it was hard for you because...

25:28.523 --> 25:30.274
But thank you.

25:31.526 --> 25:33.569
Why do you think I did it?

25:33.695 --> 25:36.072
- What?
- Why do you think I did it?

25:36.865 --> 25:39.826
I don't know.
Out of protectiveness, I guess.

25:41.161 --> 25:43.371
You don't need to be protected, Lorelai.

25:43.413 --> 25:46.249
You've made it very clear
that you can look after yourself...

25:46.332 --> 25:49.418
- and that you need nothing from anyone.
- That's not...

25:49.502 --> 25:52.212
A member of my family
was being attacked.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.298
The very Gilmore name
was being attacked.

25:54.382 --> 25:57.343
I will not stand for that,
not under any circumstances.

25:57.426 --> 26:00.303
Okay, it doesn't really matter
why you did it.

26:00.388 --> 26:03.724
Yes, it does matter why I did it.
It matters greatly!

26:03.849 --> 26:05.725
What are you going to take away
from this?

26:05.768 --> 26:10.063
That everything that happened in the past
is suddenly fine because I defended you?

26:10.105 --> 26:12.398
That the hell
you put your mother and me through...

26:12.441 --> 26:14.901
for the past 16 years
is suddenly washed away?

26:14.943 --> 26:17.236
- It's not!
- We've all been through hell.

26:17.321 --> 26:19.865
I had to tell my friends, my colleagues...

26:19.948 --> 26:23.076
that my only daughter,
the brightest in her class...

26:23.160 --> 26:25.036
was pregnant and was leaving school.

26:25.078 --> 26:26.621
That must have been devastating.

26:26.705 --> 26:29.457
Then you run away and treat us as lepers.

26:29.582 --> 26:33.043
Your mother couldn't get out of bed
for a month. Did you know that?

26:33.545 --> 26:36.923
We did nothing to deserve that.
Nothing to earn that.

26:36.965 --> 26:38.758
I get it, I'm horrible.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.470
So why don't you disown me
and adopt Christopher? You love him.

26:42.553 --> 26:45.430
Don't be a martyr, Lorelai.
And don't be naive.

26:45.515 --> 26:48.434
Do you think I love the boy
who got my daughter pregnant?

26:48.518 --> 26:51.812
I wanted to kill him.
I would have, too, with my bare hands.

26:51.896 --> 26:55.482
But there was a proper procedure
to be followed in a situation like this.

26:55.566 --> 26:56.650
Marriage.

26:56.734 --> 26:59.611
Christopher was willing to follow
the procedure we laid out.

26:59.653 --> 27:02.447
- You weren't.
- What about what I wanted?

27:02.531 --> 27:05.200
Dad, didn't that matter to you at all?

27:05.409 --> 27:06.785
Sometimes...

27:07.119 --> 27:11.373
one has to sacrifice something
in order to do what is right.

27:13.250 --> 27:16.544
I feel indescribably sad
for you right now, Dad.

27:17.421 --> 27:21.049
Save your emotions.
I've had my fill of them tonight.

27:21.758 --> 27:24.177
So we just end it here?

27:25.261 --> 27:27.137
Nothing resolved?

27:30.433 --> 27:31.809
I'm tired.

27:34.604 --> 27:35.688
Okay.

27:42.487 --> 27:44.989
There you are.
I was wondering where you went.

27:45.072 --> 27:47.991
- Sorry.
- No, it's nothing to be sorry about.

27:48.284 --> 27:50.786
- Can I get you something?
- I'm fine.

27:51.620 --> 27:53.413
That's hardly dinner.

27:55.332 --> 27:57.959
That was quite a bit of excitement tonight.

27:58.002 --> 27:59.211
Oh, yeah.

27:59.461 --> 28:01.462
- Not the good kind.
- Nope.

28:02.589 --> 28:05.508
- None of this means anything, Rory.
- I know.

28:06.426 --> 28:09.387
Straub is actually a good man, very smart.

28:10.138 --> 28:12.932
He was one of the top lawyers in his field.

28:13.016 --> 28:16.102
A very arcane aspect of international law.

28:16.686 --> 28:19.814
And he's always been so active
in his community.

28:19.856 --> 28:23.234
His charity work
has never diminished over the years.

28:25.153 --> 28:27.405
Let's face it, he's a big ass.

28:30.908 --> 28:34.327
I know you heard a lot of talk
on various disappointments this evening.

28:34.370 --> 28:37.206
I know you've heard a lot of talk
about it in the past.

28:37.290 --> 28:40.709
But I wanna make this very clear.
You, young lady...

28:40.751 --> 28:44.796
your person and your existence have never
ever been, not even for a second...

28:44.880 --> 28:46.715
included in that list.

28:47.550 --> 28:50.928
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, I do.

28:51.887 --> 28:53.930
Good. Now eat up.

29:06.902 --> 29:08.445
You look great.

29:09.237 --> 29:11.906
Yeah, I look the way I feel, wise guy.

29:16.745 --> 29:21.207
- That was a memorable evening.
- Yes, it was beautiful in there.

29:21.916 --> 29:25.002
We should commemorate it
with an oil painting...

29:25.128 --> 29:27.088
or a severed head or something.

29:27.130 --> 29:30.967
Next time we get this group together,
we're gonna have to frisk for weapons.

29:31.050 --> 29:34.970
- Hand out gags.
- Employ six individual cones of silence.

29:40.434 --> 29:42.769
The old balcony's still the same, isn't it?

29:42.853 --> 29:45.605
In all its beautiful away-from-them-ness.

29:45.648 --> 29:48.108
Perfect hideout, totally private.

29:49.193 --> 29:51.528
We spent a lot of time out here.

29:51.945 --> 29:55.031
Sneaking Dad's telescope,
scanning the skies for alien ships.

29:55.115 --> 29:56.699
Never found any.

29:56.909 --> 30:00.996
Then when we were older, scanning
the neighbors' houses for naked people.

30:01.496 --> 30:04.582
- Found a couple of those.
- Mrs. Dominski...

30:06.126 --> 30:10.213
undulating in her big, fat underalls
is forever carved into my brain.

30:10.297 --> 30:14.467
And in mine.
Here's to Mrs. Dominski's underalls.

30:16.219 --> 30:17.887
Holding out on me.

30:19.639 --> 30:20.848
Take it.

30:23.184 --> 30:26.270
And in an effort to further chronicle
this balcony's history...

30:26.312 --> 30:28.731
we are now in the immediate vicinity...

30:28.814 --> 30:32.108
of the spot upon which
was Rory's initial emanation.

30:33.319 --> 30:36.155
Yes, we are. Here's to Rory.

30:37.364 --> 30:40.825
- The bright spot in all the darkness.
- And how.

30:44.913 --> 30:49.083
Even if you hadn't gotten pregnant
and everything had gone as planned...

30:49.168 --> 30:51.753
I still would've never made it
through Princeton.

30:51.837 --> 30:53.630
I don't believe that.

30:55.007 --> 30:57.467
That's why you're you and I'm not.

31:42.052 --> 31:43.011
Wow.

31:44.847 --> 31:47.015
- You wigged?
- Yeah, I'm a little wigged.

31:47.057 --> 31:48.766
- Why?
- Are you kidding me?

31:48.850 --> 31:52.687
This is the next-to-last thing
I thought would happen tonight.

31:52.729 --> 31:56.357
The last thing being a saint
riding down on a chariot from Heaven...

31:56.441 --> 31:57.525
to announce Armageddon.

31:57.609 --> 32:01.195
Hartford's the place he chooses to make
his announcement? I don't think so.

32:01.237 --> 32:03.822
Yes, it was unexpected, but it was great.

32:03.907 --> 32:07.702
- God, I can't believe this.
- Fine. You know what? We should go.

32:07.744 --> 32:10.413
Yeah, we should go, like, 30 minutes ago.

32:11.039 --> 32:12.373
I'm sorry.

32:13.124 --> 32:16.085
Don't apologize. It was the both of us.

32:19.589 --> 32:23.676
God, my parents have got to seal
these windows up, I swear to God.

32:27.096 --> 32:29.306
- So, where were you guys?
- Nowhere.

32:29.390 --> 32:31.725
- Where's nowhere?
- Where we were.

32:40.651 --> 32:43.111
- Good night, you.
- Good night, Dad.

32:45.989 --> 32:48.574
- Good night, Lor.
- Good night, yeah...

32:49.034 --> 32:51.286
You have a really good night.

32:55.749 --> 32:58.626
You've got some dirt
or some schmutz on your...

32:58.710 --> 33:00.586
- Where did you...
- It's been a long night.

33:00.628 --> 33:03.505
There's just been a lot
of schmutzing going on.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.925
Come on, we haven't really had
a chance to talk.

33:05.967 --> 33:07.968
- About the schmutzing?
- No.

33:08.011 --> 33:11.097
About all the warm and fuzzy
family moments that went on tonight.

33:11.180 --> 33:13.265
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:13.307 --> 33:17.519
All those crazy people saying horrible
things were directing them at me, not you.

33:17.603 --> 33:19.938
They were directing them to you
because you had me.

33:19.980 --> 33:22.690
No, they were directing them at me
because I screwed up...

33:22.775 --> 33:25.611
their big Citizen Kane plans, that's all.

33:25.653 --> 33:28.655
- They don't even wanna know me.
- That is not true.

33:28.739 --> 33:31.408
They are just so full of anger
and stupid pride...

33:31.492 --> 33:35.662
that stands in the way of them realizing
how much they wanna know you.

33:35.704 --> 33:36.788
Yeah.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.582
Their loss, and it's a pretty big one.

33:39.666 --> 33:41.459
I'm going to bed now.

33:44.171 --> 33:46.464
No regrets from me or your dad.

33:46.673 --> 33:49.509
- Yeah?
- No regrets about you.

33:49.801 --> 33:53.763
There's a misspelled-tattoo incident that
I'm sure he'd like to erase from his bio.

33:53.847 --> 33:55.390
But you, that's a no-brainer.

33:55.473 --> 33:57.641
Where does dad have a misspelled tattoo?

33:57.684 --> 34:01.604
Another story for another time,
possibly before your first trip to Mazatlan.

34:01.688 --> 34:04.148
- Good night, babe.
- Good night, Mom.

34:23.708 --> 34:24.918
Oh, no.

34:34.969 --> 34:36.596
- I feel horrible.
- Don't.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.848
- I stood you up. I didn't even call.
- It's okay.

34:38.931 --> 34:42.893
- I'm a rat. We had a date. I stood you up.
- It wasn't a date. It was just to paint.

34:42.936 --> 34:44.771
- I'm a rat. I need cheese.
- Forget it.

34:44.853 --> 34:47.606
- Let's reschedule.
- I didn't wanna do it in the first place.

34:47.690 --> 34:51.860
Come on, don't change your mind.
We can do it tonight or right now.

34:52.779 --> 34:54.697
- Was it an emergency?
- Yes.

34:54.739 --> 34:58.784
You would not believe what happened.
I slipped, and I busted my...

34:59.452 --> 35:01.412
It wasn't an emergency.

35:01.996 --> 35:03.956
It was just me being a rat.

35:04.040 --> 35:05.749
- Something came up?
- Yeah.

35:05.791 --> 35:07.792
Something, someone.

35:08.961 --> 35:11.588
- Am I right?
- I'm sorry.

35:12.673 --> 35:16.218
Yeah, okay. Well, I'm late.

35:27.396 --> 35:28.730
Where were you?

35:28.772 --> 35:31.858
Fruitlessly trying to rectify
a ratty transgression.

35:31.942 --> 35:33.943
- You want some coffee?
- No.

35:34.277 --> 35:35.361
What?

35:35.612 --> 35:38.698
I know you well enough to know
that when you say no to coffee...

35:38.782 --> 35:41.659
- all is not right in Whoville.
- Very astute.

35:41.785 --> 35:43.453
So, last night...

35:44.079 --> 35:46.664
Last night was Chernobyl
and the Hindenburg combined.

35:46.748 --> 35:49.625
- Right, just checking.
- My father almost hit someone.

35:49.709 --> 35:52.878
He's probably only hit someone
in college wearing boxing gloves...

35:52.962 --> 35:55.798
and one of those Fred Mertz,
Golden Gloves pullover sweaters.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.508
- Fred Mertz?
- I Love Lucy, Fred Mertz.

35:57.592 --> 36:00.386
Landlord to Ricky, husband to Ethel.
It's a weird reference.

36:00.469 --> 36:02.596
- Hello, pajamas.
- Right, continue.

36:02.680 --> 36:05.724
- My dad had a meltdown with your dad...
- He was asking for it.

36:05.808 --> 36:09.436
...and then with me.
And then, you and me.

36:09.812 --> 36:11.647
- Oh, boy.
- Don't say it like that.

36:11.689 --> 36:13.649
- Stupid. Dumb.
- Much better.

36:13.732 --> 36:16.860
And to top off the whole fabulous fiasco...

36:16.944 --> 36:19.363
I stood up a friend
who was counting on me.

36:19.446 --> 36:22.740
He just stood there looking hurt
with the paint and the chairs.

36:22.824 --> 36:24.784
And it hurt me. It's not your fault.

36:24.868 --> 36:27.203
But in this parade of stupid and dumb...

36:27.287 --> 36:29.997
I am the one twirling the flaming baton.

36:30.082 --> 36:31.333
- Lor?
- What?

36:31.458 --> 36:33.167
I wanna marry you.

36:34.669 --> 36:37.713
And the hits just keep on coming.

36:37.797 --> 36:39.673
Just think about it
before you make a rash...

36:39.758 --> 36:43.386
You are completely insane.
You have flipped your lid!

36:43.470 --> 36:45.847
Charlie Manson is freaked out
by you right now!

36:45.889 --> 36:48.349
- Come on, we're already a family.
- Who's a family?

36:48.391 --> 36:49.683
Us. You, me, and Rory.

36:49.767 --> 36:52.603
- You don't know what a family is.
- People living together.

36:52.687 --> 36:56.565
No, it's a big commitment.
It's responsibility and hard work.

36:56.649 --> 37:00.152
It's coming home at the same time
to the same place every day.

37:00.236 --> 37:02.112
What do you want, financial statements?

37:02.196 --> 37:04.531
I can be a family man.
I'm responsible now.

37:04.573 --> 37:09.077
Honey, you can't even buy a book
without having your credit card declined.

37:09.244 --> 37:12.121
I told Rory not to rat me out.
I can't believe she did that.

37:12.206 --> 37:13.332
She didn't.

37:13.415 --> 37:16.376
Andrew from the bookstore called,
and Jackson, and the UPS guy.

37:16.418 --> 37:18.795
It was the lead story
on the Stars Hollow web page.

37:18.879 --> 37:21.673
Then I asked Rory,
and she very reluctantly confirmed it.

37:21.715 --> 37:24.467
- 'Rat me out. ' What are you, 16?
- I'm sorry.

37:24.551 --> 37:27.345
What are you doing telling my daughter
to lie to me, anyway?

37:27.387 --> 37:29.847
- She's my daughter, too.
- More like your playmate.

37:29.890 --> 37:32.267
I don't deserve that. I'm as mature as you.

37:32.350 --> 37:35.895
What? The Offspring is your favorite band.

37:35.979 --> 37:37.897
So? You're into Metallica.

37:37.939 --> 37:40.524
Metallica is way more substantial
than The Offspring.

37:40.567 --> 37:43.194
It's the same Black Sabbath riff
all over again.

37:43.236 --> 37:46.614
The Offspring have one chord progression.
They use it over and over.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.782
They pop on new words
and call it a single.

37:48.866 --> 37:50.534
I don't wanna talk about this anymore!

37:50.576 --> 37:52.911
I'm the immature and irresponsible one.

37:52.995 --> 37:55.247
I was willing to get married
when you got pregnant.

37:55.331 --> 37:58.083
We were too young
and wouldn't have made it. You know that.

37:58.167 --> 38:00.127
We're not too young now.

38:00.586 --> 38:02.796
Okay, now I need some coffee.

38:07.134 --> 38:10.845
What about last night?
What did our having sex mean to you?

38:11.096 --> 38:14.557
It meant that Jose Cuervo
still has amazing magical powers.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.101
You're funny.

38:20.272 --> 38:24.067
We can't get married, Christopher.
We don't even know each other as adults.

38:24.109 --> 38:26.903
Let's get married
and get to know each other as adults.

38:27.279 --> 38:29.572
That's very Fiddler on the Roof of you.

38:29.614 --> 38:32.450
Let's get to know each other.
What do you wanna know?

38:32.492 --> 38:34.911
How's your business really doing?

38:41.167 --> 38:42.501
I knew it.

38:42.794 --> 38:46.380
I was gonna tell you
if it didn't pick up soon. I swear.

38:46.464 --> 38:49.300
You just sat there last night,
just smiling and nodding...

38:49.342 --> 38:51.552
while my dad and your dad
went on and on...

38:51.635 --> 38:54.971
about Christopher and his
great big business success in California.

38:55.014 --> 38:56.557
I didn't wanna upset anybody.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.641
- I wanted last night to be nice.
- It was.

38:58.726 --> 39:00.853
It would've been better
if I would've announced:

39:00.936 --> 39:03.438
'On top of everything you're upset about,
I wanna add...

39:03.522 --> 39:05.982
'I'm the world's biggest loser. '
Would that be festive?

39:06.066 --> 39:08.151
- You're not a loser.
- Please.

39:08.235 --> 39:10.278
You're a liar, but you're not a loser.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.447
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:12.990 --> 39:16.368
We're arguing like an old married couple.
Doesn't that show potential?

39:16.451 --> 39:18.744
Christopher, I swear to God...

39:20.747 --> 39:24.375
I've been looking for the one.
That elusive soul mate. I really have.

39:24.459 --> 39:27.003
I just believe it's you. It's always been you.

39:27.087 --> 39:30.256
- Chris, come on.
- Rory might be my only child.

39:30.590 --> 39:34.093
That's not true. If Tony Randall
can crank one out in his 70s...

39:34.177 --> 39:36.470
you have decades left to spawn.

39:36.679 --> 39:40.641
I don't know how much I miss Rory
until I see her like this.

39:42.018 --> 39:43.853
It's easier staying away.

39:43.936 --> 39:46.813
No, don't stay away.

39:48.524 --> 39:49.650
Don't.

39:51.944 --> 39:53.695
Rory needs her dad.

39:56.156 --> 39:57.824
Or her pal, right?

39:59.576 --> 40:01.661
I think she'd take a combo.

40:07.417 --> 40:09.961
- Call us when you get home.
- I will.

40:10.337 --> 40:13.047
- And call more.
- I will.

40:17.844 --> 40:19.053
See you.

40:23.266 --> 40:25.851
Dad wants to know if you'll reconsider.

40:34.443 --> 40:37.904
She says, 'Nope, Offspring sucks
and Metallica rules. '

40:39.615 --> 40:41.033
Fair enough.

40:45.121 --> 40:46.539
Drive safe.

40:59.134 --> 41:02.428
- He wanted you to marry him, didn't he?
- Spy.

41:02.888 --> 41:04.764
You know, crazier things have happened.

41:04.806 --> 41:06.766
Crazier than having
your mom and dad married?

41:06.850 --> 41:08.434
- Yes.
- I don't think they have.

41:08.518 --> 41:10.519
- Why is that so crazy?
- Because it is.

41:10.604 --> 41:13.982
Because he wants things
he is not ready for.

41:14.149 --> 41:18.027
- How do you know?
- I know him so well, you have no idea.

41:18.361 --> 41:20.863
Maybe he can change. Maybe it's different.

41:20.947 --> 41:23.908
He did come here this time.
He's never done that before.

41:23.950 --> 41:25.284
- Stop.
- Why?

41:25.368 --> 41:27.787
I don't want you
getting all worked up over this.

41:27.829 --> 41:29.580
- He loves you.
- He does love me.

41:29.622 --> 41:31.582
- Do you love him?
- Honey, come on.

41:31.624 --> 41:32.958
Answer me.

41:33.125 --> 41:34.668
- Honestly?
- Yes.

41:35.086 --> 41:37.963
- I will probably always love him.
- Okay, so?

41:38.005 --> 41:39.589
But that doesn't change the fact...

41:39.632 --> 41:43.844
that he still has a long way to go
before he is ready to take us on full time.

41:43.928 --> 41:45.804
I mean, you are a handful, missy.

41:45.888 --> 41:48.390
While I'm pure joy and sunshine
every waking hour...

41:48.474 --> 41:51.643
I still have my own set of needs
that must be met.

41:52.186 --> 41:55.772
It just wasn't right, babe.
You have to trust me on that.

42:01.153 --> 42:02.612
Talk, please.

42:03.280 --> 42:06.116
I still think
there was a little something different.

42:06.157 --> 42:08.284
- Maybe you're right.
- Really?

42:08.576 --> 42:11.328
- It would be nice.
- Yeah, it would.

42:12.205 --> 42:15.875
I'll tell you what,
let's not put all the blankets away just yet.

42:15.959 --> 42:18.294
- Really?
- You never know.

42:35.936 --> 42:37.354
What the...

42:39.189 --> 42:42.233
- How'd you get in here?
- Your bread guy let me in.

42:42.318 --> 42:44.153
I'm switching bread guys.

42:44.194 --> 42:47.030
- What do you think?
- I think you shouldn't break and enter.

42:47.114 --> 42:48.740
So what do you think?

42:48.824 --> 42:51.826
I've got to admit it looks pretty good.

42:52.577 --> 42:54.912
- I knew you'd like it.
- Thanks.

42:54.996 --> 42:57.164
Anytime. It's fun.

43:00.293 --> 43:02.044
So, where's the guy?

43:03.004 --> 43:05.256
- He's gone.
- Too bad.

43:05.757 --> 43:07.258
We'll be fine.

43:10.011 --> 43:11.178
- Luke?
- Yeah?

43:11.679 --> 43:14.306
- Can I make one more suggestion?
- Nope.

43:14.390 --> 43:15.891
- Curtains.
- No.

43:16.351 --> 43:18.227
- Manly curtains.
- Oxymoron.

43:18.311 --> 43:20.020
- What did you call me?
- No curtains.

43:20.062 --> 43:21.313
Come on!

43:21.397 --> 43:23.857
You got to give a little.
How about a tablecloth?

43:23.899 --> 43:26.151
No, we don't do tablecloths here.
