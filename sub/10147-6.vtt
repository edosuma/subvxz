WEBVTT

01:21.666 --> 01:22.500
Ah.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.543
The T7 Chip,

01:24.627 --> 01:26.254
digital gold.

01:26.337 --> 01:27.630
Sweet.

01:32.468 --> 01:33.886
Not this time, guys.

01:47.900 --> 01:48.900
Aah!

02:10.089 --> 02:11.089
Huh?

02:17.555 --> 02:19.015
What's your hurry, handsome?

02:19.598 --> 02:20.598
Aah!

02:43.289 --> 02:44.874
Relax, I've got you.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.525
Scratch three losers.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.070
Did you see that? Amazing!

03:14.153 --> 03:15.196
Terrific!

03:23.913 --> 03:25.456
Who are those guys?

03:26.540 --> 03:29.418
<i>Magma,</i> Freon and the 2-D <i>Man.</i>

03:29.502 --> 03:31.379
<i>Who is this Terrific Trio?</i>

03:31.462 --> 03:34.382
<i>Tonight, we've got
the exclusive inside story.</i>

03:34.465 --> 03:36.485
<i>Several months ago,
at the Bay Ridge Research Center,</i>

03:36.509 --> 03:39.053
<i>prize-winning physicist Dr. Mike Morgan</i>

03:39.136 --> 03:42.264
<i>his fianc√©e Mary Michaels,
and lab assistant Stuart Lowe</i>

03:42.348 --> 03:45.309
<i>were accidently exposed
to dangerous levels of radiation</i>

03:45.393 --> 03:47.228
<i>during a particle fusion experiment.</i>

03:47.311 --> 03:49.647
<i>We warn viewers
that the tape we're about to show</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:51.107
<i>may be too intense for children.</i>

03:51.399 --> 03:52.441
Turn it up.

04:02.493 --> 04:03.494
- Cool.
- Cool.

04:03.786 --> 04:06.914
The <i>result...
Their</i> bodies underwent dramatic changes.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.686
<i>Now, these heroes have promised</i>

04:28.769 --> 04:32.189
<i>to use their incredible
abilities to clean up Gotham.</i>

04:32.273 --> 04:34.108
<i>The government has spared no expense</i>

04:34.191 --> 04:36.318
<i>in establishing their
new base of operations.</i>

04:36.402 --> 04:37.820
<i>The Trio Tower.</i>

04:39.864 --> 04:41.949
<i>United in their war on crime,</i>

04:42.199 --> 04:44.368
<i>here comes the Terrific Trio.</i>

04:46.871 --> 04:49.540
Looks like I'll be having a lot more
time to do my homework now.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.041
We'll see.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.889
Wait, just a little more time.
That's all I'm asking.

05:06.474 --> 05:08.851
Hope you have better luck.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.102
This is Gordon.

05:10.186 --> 05:13.189
Finally, someone with
a real line of credit.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.610
No deals until I know
the hostages are safe.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.988
Sweetheart, I've already
been through this with your cub scouts.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.990
I'm lookin' at
my foreign account right now

05:23.073 --> 05:24.742
and still no donations.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.368
You better hurry, love.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.954
<i>Telethon's over in five minutes.</i>

05:29.038 --> 05:30.838
- Should we go in?
- We can't take the chance.

05:30.915 --> 05:32.708
That's Councilman Green's
family in there.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.379
- She'll cave.
- And if she don't?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.340
Plan B.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.850
Guess who?

05:52.478 --> 05:53.478
Hey!

06:01.153 --> 06:03.489
What's the matter, boys?
Cold feet?

06:07.576 --> 06:09.370
Wrong door, Einstein.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.461
- Move in!
- Let's go!

06:28.389 --> 06:29.390
Freeze!

06:32.142 --> 06:33.644
Been there, done that.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.867
Don't let him hurt me!

06:50.536 --> 06:51.704
We'll take it from here.

06:54.999 --> 06:56.041
Right.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.597
- Hey, that's police property.
- You tell him.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.727
You saw the way
she looked at me.

07:17.813 --> 07:18.813
We're freaks.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.525
Michael, please.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.699
I can't even hold you
in my arms anymore.

07:30.868 --> 07:34.163
- It's hard for all of us.
- I can imagine, my dear.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.457
You wouldn't have to imagine
if you'd been there.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.709
Yeah,
I'm still trying to figure out

07:38.792 --> 07:40.472
that budget meeting
you went to that night.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.379
What are you implying?

07:42.463 --> 07:43.672
Calm down, Mike.

07:43.756 --> 07:46.133
It's not like he knew
this was going to happen.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.469
Mary, you know how much I care for you.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.721
All of you.
And we're doing everything we can

07:50.804 --> 07:51.889
to find a cure.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.390
You should let me help.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.101
Michael, you can't even
touch a test tube without melting it.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.562
Better you stay here
where you can do some real good.

08:17.748 --> 08:18.832
How are they?

08:18.916 --> 08:21.460
Angry, frustrated, confused...

08:21.669 --> 08:23.712
You promised you could control them.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.131
Give them time.
It's a big adjustment.

08:26.215 --> 08:27.800
I hope you're right, Dr. Hodges.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.762
'Cause heaven help us if you're not.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.955
- Hey, peg it, Magma underwear.
- Schway.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.749
Yeah, it's great to finally
have some clean wholesome heroes

09:00.833 --> 09:02.376
that kids can look up to.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.129
Ah, those guys are twips.
Batman rips.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.005
- You think?
- Big time!

09:07.089 --> 09:08.924
How about an ice cream?
My treat.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.175
Sure!

09:10.384 --> 09:11.552
What's the catch?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.363
These are the Trio's latest DNA scans.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.417
- Has anyone seen this?
- No, sir.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.710
Well, run them again.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.378
We've gotta be absolutely certain.

09:46.462 --> 09:47.463
Yes, sir.

09:57.139 --> 09:58.974
General Norman, we've got a problem.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.773
I don't know why
you even bothered to send me out.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.048
With the Terrific Trio around

10:31.131 --> 10:33.175
there's not even
a purse snatcher in sight.

10:33.509 --> 10:36.094
Hold on. I'm picking up
a hot spot on the infrared.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.930
- <i>A fire?</i>
- Or a weenie roast.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.348
I'll check it out.

10:51.985 --> 10:52.985
Uh-oh.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.571
What is it?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.365
It ain't Smokey the Bear.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.677
Magma, working solo tonight?

11:16.760 --> 11:17.760
Out of my way.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.734
How about showing a fellow civil servant

11:32.818 --> 11:34.152
some professional courtesy?

11:36.029 --> 11:37.029
Aah! Oh.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.179
And I thought
he was one of the good guys.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.413
I can't believe you broke into the lab.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.415
Why would you take such a risk?

12:28.498 --> 12:30.000
I had to know the truth.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.169
- But, Hodges said-
- Hodges lied.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.587
See for yourself.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.108
- We'II be like this forever.
- No. It's worse than that.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.245
What happened?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.165
We're under attack!

13:13.210 --> 13:15.545
It's General Norman!
We've been double-crossed!

13:21.176 --> 13:22.970
Hit 'em hard.
Don't let 'em get away!

13:28.350 --> 13:29.851
Now the army's attacking.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.495
I thought they were the good guys, too.

13:34.231 --> 13:35.983
McGinnis, get out of there, now!

13:39.695 --> 13:40.696
Fire!

14:00.090 --> 14:01.090
Terry!

14:21.862 --> 14:22.946
Fire!

15:03.945 --> 15:04.946
After 'em!

15:31.807 --> 15:32.808
Stand back!

15:42.442 --> 15:43.735
They're heading for the hangar!

15:45.445 --> 15:46.571
I see them.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.824
Let's take them down, Major.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.294
This is Eagle One.
Target has been eliminated.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.088
<i>Station your men at all the entrances.</i>

16:03.171 --> 16:05.006
<i>I want that tower secured.</i>

16:05.090 --> 16:07.551
You heard the general.
Those freaks are history.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.722
I don't think so.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.184
The car was just a decoy?

16:16.268 --> 16:17.435
See for yourself.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.729
It's not over yet.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.733
<i>I know
they</i> were <i>your friends, Dr.</i> Hodges.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.319
<i>But you yourself said
their condition was deteriorating</i>

16:26.403 --> 16:29.322
<i>and eventually they would have
become dangerously psychotic.</i>

16:35.912 --> 16:37.080
Hello, Howard.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.252
We have to talk.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.174
We've been reviewing the data

16:47.257 --> 16:49.009
on the particle fusion experiment.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.555
According to your notes,
you knew about the danger.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.057
No! I had no idea this would happen.

16:56.141 --> 16:59.436
- Just a freak accident?
- Yes. One in a million.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.567
Wait! What are you doing?

17:05.650 --> 17:07.944
- Finishing what we started.
- But you can't.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.863
- Why not?
- You'll kill us all!

17:09.946 --> 17:12.824
Once it reaches critical mass,
the radiation can't be contained.

17:12.908 --> 17:15.327
- Then you knew all along.
- Yes.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.579
That's why you weren't there that night.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.581
Yes, and you weren't
supposed to be either.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.166
- What?
- Michael had it all.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.127
The brains, the success, your affection.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.504
I figured, with him out of the way,
I'd have a chance.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.131
You figured wrong.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.677
Please turn it off.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.013
No.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.848
But the whole city
will become a hot zone.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.308
You're crazy!

17:38.391 --> 17:41.269
I believe your words were
"dangerously psychotic."

17:41.353 --> 17:43.313
We are what you made us.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.481
Party's over.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.130
Finish him. Now!

18:21.351 --> 18:22.477
No!

18:39.035 --> 18:40.035
Michael!

18:52.507 --> 18:54.134
I gotta shut that thing off.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.885
Thousands of people will die.

18:56.261 --> 18:59.180
Mag... Dr. Morgan,
you can't let that happen.

18:59.264 --> 19:01.433
- You're a hero, remember?
- No.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.601
I'm an accident.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.061
Real heroes, they make a choice.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.813
I never did.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.778
No. You're staying for this.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.406
- Satisfied?
- No.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.784
You don't understand.
I was their friend.

20:01.743 --> 20:02.744
Right.
