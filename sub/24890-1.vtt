02:16.678 --> 02:18.643
Nice, Jameson,
let them hands go!

02:20.214 --> 02:21.380
There we go.

02:21.382 --> 02:22.447
Come on!

02:22.449 --> 02:24.416
Uh-huh, there you go, nice work.

02:24.418 --> 02:27.420
There you go Jameson,
nice, baby, nice!

02:29.323 --> 02:30.959
Hey, check it out.

02:33.027 --> 02:33.894
Pete!

02:36.597 --> 02:39.332
That's Marco Reign, man!

02:39.334 --> 02:40.198
Yeah, like that.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.735
Hey, Pete, good to see ya!

02:42.737 --> 02:44.269
How you doin'?

02:44.271 --> 02:46.873
Are you still trainin'
the riff-raff I see, huh?

02:46.875 --> 02:48.808
You haven't
changed much, Green.

02:49.811 --> 02:51.476
Welcome to the mat!

02:51.478 --> 02:54.880
Well thanks, I'd like to
introduce you to Marco Reign.

02:54.882 --> 02:56.781
It's an honor.

02:56.783 --> 02:58.718
What can I do for you?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.518
What's he doing here?

03:00.520 --> 03:01.887
I don't know.

03:01.889 --> 03:03.488
Uh well, you know, I
just wanted to show him

03:03.490 --> 03:06.559
the old stompin' grounds,
we got a match coming up.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.394
That big fight whether
Del Toro coming up, right?

03:09.396 --> 03:11.064
I got a lotta
money on that match.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.864
Oh yeah, who you got?

03:12.866 --> 03:14.233
What do you think?

03:14.235 --> 03:15.368
And
well, we were looking

03:15.370 --> 03:16.972
for a sparring partner.

03:18.005 --> 03:19.172
I'm just saying man.

03:19.174 --> 03:20.106
I'd make a better champion

03:20.108 --> 03:21.506
than that fool any day.

03:21.508 --> 03:22.774
How 'bout
that guy back there?

03:22.776 --> 03:23.875
Which one?

03:23.877 --> 03:25.511
The one hittin' the pad?

03:25.513 --> 03:27.049
That's Jameson.

03:28.114 --> 03:30.416
Hey, he's pointin' at you!

03:30.418 --> 03:32.650
You might get that
shot after all.

03:32.652 --> 03:34.420
'Bout time!

03:34.422 --> 03:38.323
Think the other guy holding
the bag would be perfect.

03:38.325 --> 03:40.893
He's about the same
size as Del Toro.

03:40.895 --> 03:43.561
A little older, but seasoned.

03:43.563 --> 03:45.932
My favorite fighter in the gym.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.333
Come on, come on!

03:47.335 --> 03:48.400
Let's go!

03:48.402 --> 03:50.236
He just wants
somebody to dance around

03:50.238 --> 03:52.471
for a few rounds, you know.

03:52.473 --> 03:54.273
I'm sorry to make it
such short notice,

03:54.275 --> 03:56.676
but, if you can give him a try?

03:56.678 --> 03:57.642
Sure.

03:57.644 --> 03:59.378
Yeah, yeah, Jameson!

03:59.380 --> 04:00.546
Come on.

04:00.548 --> 04:01.915
Rip through 'em!

04:01.917 --> 04:03.815
Rip through 'em,
baby, rip through 'em!

04:03.817 --> 04:05.086
There you go!

04:05.819 --> 04:07.089
There you go!

04:07.822 --> 04:09.324
Hey, Ty!

04:11.258 --> 04:12.126
Come!

04:13.293 --> 04:14.195
Come here!

04:18.798 --> 04:20.365
Seriously, man?

04:20.367 --> 04:21.368
Seriously.

04:28.576 --> 04:30.944
Okay, we got a
photo shoot at three,

04:30.946 --> 04:32.444
so I'm thinking you
shouldn't change,

04:32.446 --> 04:35.814
you should just go dressed
as you are, alright?

04:35.816 --> 04:36.848
How are you feelin'?

04:36.850 --> 04:38.218
Alright?

04:38.220 --> 04:39.585
Okay, let's make
this short and sweet.

04:39.587 --> 04:42.958
Just, show this kid
who ya are, right?

04:52.133 --> 04:53.932
They want someone
to warm Reign up

04:53.934 --> 04:56.337
before his fight this week.

04:58.905 --> 05:00.475
You know Marco?

05:02.742 --> 05:05.178
I know his manager, Green.

05:06.280 --> 05:10.118
Long story short, Ben
and I work together.

05:10.919 --> 05:13.087
He poached my fighters.

05:14.756 --> 05:17.025
That was a long time ago.

05:18.859 --> 05:21.530
Listen, don't hurt him too bad.

05:22.496 --> 05:23.899
Keep it simple.

05:24.965 --> 05:28.136
Remember, this is
good for business.

05:30.071 --> 05:33.038
I'll make you look good.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.108
I promise.

05:36.943 --> 05:38.412
You always do.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.996
Careful.

05:56.998 --> 05:59.165
Watch your face, we
got that photo shoot.

05:59.167 --> 06:00.400
Do your thing, Marco.

06:00.402 --> 06:03.138
Let's make this quick, now.

06:06.508 --> 06:08.807
That kid's built
like a freight train.

06:08.809 --> 06:10.076
Work that!

06:10.078 --> 06:13.011
Alright,
do your thing.

06:13.013 --> 06:14.149
Nice feint.

06:16.184 --> 06:18.386
Stay in his face, Marco.

06:19.955 --> 06:22.821
Hey, your work on
looking for, Marco.

06:26.895 --> 06:28.427
Down, down!

06:28.429 --> 06:29.297
Yes, yeah!

06:30.597 --> 06:32.097
Get him down!

06:47.282 --> 06:49.217
Round one is over.

06:56.790 --> 06:58.624
How you holding up?

06:58.626 --> 06:59.661
Nice throw.

07:00.727 --> 07:04.098
I got him right
where I want him.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.137
Just another day
in the office, man.

07:12.039 --> 07:13.237
Do what you do.

07:13.239 --> 07:14.773
Do it out there, man.

07:14.775 --> 07:16.110
Okay.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.015
Let's go, Marco.

07:21.849 --> 07:23.251
Let's go, baby!

07:29.590 --> 07:32.523
Four minutes,
left, hold on, now.

07:32.525 --> 07:35.026
Take it, take it, hold
in there, for four.

07:35.028 --> 07:37.095
- Come on, Marco.
- Relax.

07:37.097 --> 07:38.362
Focus.

07:38.364 --> 07:40.398
That's right, that's it.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.403
Yeah, focus.

07:46.806 --> 07:48.040
Go Marco!

07:56.051 --> 07:58.518
Tap out,
motherfucker, tap out.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.654
Yeah, tap out.

08:01.054 --> 08:02.920
Tapped out!

08:02.922 --> 08:03.788
Fuck, man!

08:03.790 --> 08:04.655
Bullshit!

08:04.657 --> 08:05.391
Easy!

08:05.393 --> 08:06.891
Marco, it's over!

08:06.893 --> 08:08.927
That's it, that's it!

08:08.929 --> 08:10.061
That's over!

08:10.063 --> 08:11.097
Hey, Marco,

08:11.099 --> 08:12.434
- it's over!
- Punk!

08:14.301 --> 08:15.566
- Punk ass shit, boy!
- It's okay.

08:15.568 --> 08:17.703
It's practice,
practice, it's practice.

08:17.705 --> 08:19.103
Shaun get our stuff,
meet us in the car.

08:19.105 --> 08:20.573
Bullshit, man!

08:20.575 --> 08:24.076
Yeah, come on, come
on, come on, let's go.

08:24.078 --> 08:25.714
I'm sorry, Green!

08:30.083 --> 08:31.449
Holy!

08:31.451 --> 08:34.620
I thought it was just practice!

08:39.960 --> 08:41.595
You are something!

08:44.797 --> 08:47.668
You are.

09:10.858 --> 09:12.958
That might not have
been good for business,

09:12.960 --> 09:15.496
but it sure was fun to watch.

09:17.764 --> 09:20.401
Can't believe you
pulled that off.

09:21.168 --> 09:23.504
I learned from the best.

09:25.105 --> 09:26.441
Here you go.

09:27.675 --> 09:28.777
You earned it.

09:30.076 --> 09:31.145
Thanks.

09:35.516 --> 09:39.254
You should head home
and get some rest.

09:40.086 --> 09:41.155
Hey, Pete.

09:44.325 --> 09:45.656
You think I could've
pulled that off

09:45.658 --> 09:47.059
in front of a thousand
screaming fans

09:47.061 --> 09:49.027
and a bunch of TV cameras?

09:49.029 --> 09:50.562
I don't know, Ty.

09:50.564 --> 09:53.698
I mean, to him it
was just practice.

09:53.700 --> 09:58.239
Plus there is something to
be said for home advantage.

10:03.110 --> 10:05.312
You're probably right.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.388
Hey, Ty.

10:16.858 --> 10:20.795
I think you'd beat him
if it really counted.

10:21.829 --> 10:22.830
I really do.

10:26.968 --> 10:28.800
See you tomorrow, Pete.

10:28.802 --> 10:29.671
See you.

10:42.950 --> 10:43.818
Oh, Ty.

10:45.418 --> 10:47.319
Dude, that was incredible.

10:47.321 --> 10:48.420
It was just a good work out.

10:48.422 --> 10:50.389
No, no, no, no.

10:50.391 --> 10:52.056
That was fire, bro.

10:52.058 --> 10:53.594
I mean pure fire.

10:55.128 --> 10:56.194
Watch, check it out.

10:56.196 --> 10:58.429
I got it right here, watch.

11:01.768 --> 11:03.102
Being all that.

11:03.104 --> 11:04.737
Come on.

11:04.739 --> 11:06.038
You know, this is something
you could show your kids.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.107
Whatever, man.

11:08.109 --> 11:09.274
You know, let's get a drink.

11:09.276 --> 11:10.342
I'm buying, come on, celebrate.

11:10.344 --> 11:11.142
Look, I'm tired, alright?

11:11.144 --> 11:12.176
I'm headed home.

11:12.178 --> 11:13.712
Rain check on that drink.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.846
Yeah.

11:14.848 --> 11:17.716
Alright, whatever
you say, champ.

11:17.718 --> 11:18.553
Hey.

11:20.253 --> 11:21.987
Send me that video.

11:21.989 --> 11:23.389
You liked it.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.556
Trying to be all cool,
but you liked it.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.992
Alright, you got it.

11:43.811 --> 11:44.679
Whitney!

11:53.053 --> 11:53.922
Whitney!

12:06.066 --> 12:07.131
Whitney, come here.

12:07.133 --> 12:09.734
You never guessed what happened.

12:09.736 --> 12:12.136
I can see what happened.

12:12.138 --> 12:12.974
Jesus, Ty.

12:14.441 --> 12:15.940
Look at your face.

12:15.942 --> 12:17.976
You should see
what I did to him.

12:17.978 --> 12:19.044
Come here.

12:19.046 --> 12:21.449
I wanna show you something.

12:31.492 --> 12:33.824
Is that, what's his name?

12:33.826 --> 12:35.493
Yes it is.

12:35.495 --> 12:36.630
Look at me.

12:37.798 --> 12:38.865
Damn, baby.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.200
Look, I made
Marco Reign tap out.

12:43.202 --> 12:44.736
I went toe to toe with the best.

12:44.738 --> 12:49.073
I could tell my kids
that I beat the best.

12:49.075 --> 12:50.942
Tell whose kids?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.043
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:52.045 --> 12:52.944
Did I say my kids?

12:52.946 --> 12:53.779
I heard my kids.

12:53.781 --> 12:56.017
I meant to say our kids.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.421
I gotta go.

13:03.423 --> 13:07.126
Kim called in sick today
so I gotta work tonight.

13:07.128 --> 13:09.895
You're not gonna be
working that job as longer.

13:09.897 --> 13:11.429
Well look, I'm
telling you Whitney,

13:11.431 --> 13:15.003
things are really
about to change for us.

13:17.236 --> 13:18.703
You know I love you baby.

13:18.705 --> 13:21.240
And I'm so proud of you.

13:21.242 --> 13:22.310
I just.

13:23.810 --> 13:27.246
I wish you would think
about getting a real job.

13:27.248 --> 13:28.213
Ty.

13:28.215 --> 13:29.647
Come on, here we go.

13:29.649 --> 13:31.717
Here we go with that
real job stuff again.

13:31.719 --> 13:35.657
Can we not have that
conversation right now?

13:48.902 --> 13:49.771
Hey.

13:52.773 --> 13:53.641
Hey.

14:13.125 --> 14:14.661
You smile for me?

14:15.896 --> 14:16.764
Stop.

14:17.864 --> 14:18.865
Come here.

14:21.234 --> 14:22.537
Smile for me.

14:29.474 --> 14:29.775
- Stop.
- Yes.

14:29.777 --> 14:31.109
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

14:31.111 --> 14:33.046
That smile right there.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.347
I hate you.

14:35.349 --> 14:36.417
I know.

14:41.088 --> 14:45.089
I just want us to
think about our future.

14:45.091 --> 14:46.026
That's all.

14:51.431 --> 14:53.433
This is our future.

15:02.508 --> 15:04.275
I gotta close tonight so,

15:04.277 --> 15:05.613
don't wake up.

16:22.489 --> 16:23.454
Hello.

16:23.456 --> 16:24.655
Hello, Ty Matthews.

16:24.657 --> 16:26.257
This is Ben Green.

16:26.259 --> 16:28.660
We didn't get a chance to be
properly introduced early today

16:28.662 --> 16:30.931
but I manage Marco Reign.

16:32.465 --> 16:34.900
Yeah, I know who you are.

16:35.801 --> 16:39.306
Thanks for recommending
Jameson to our gym.

16:40.273 --> 16:42.940
Yes, but I have
a proposal for you.

16:42.942 --> 16:47.545
If you could come by my
house tomorrow morning.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.647
I'll text you my address.

16:49.649 --> 16:50.548
Yeah.

16:50.550 --> 16:51.817
Yeah, what time?

16:51.819 --> 16:53.184
First thing in the morning.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.987
And by the way, it
goes without saying,

16:55.989 --> 16:57.555
no mention of what
happened earlier

16:57.557 --> 17:00.159
to anyone today, alright?

17:00.161 --> 17:02.361
Yeah, yeah, of course.

17:02.363 --> 17:03.694
Bye bye.

17:03.696 --> 17:06.800
Alright, well, I
see you tomorrow.

17:40.801 --> 17:42.600
Hi, may I help you?

17:42.602 --> 17:44.034
Hey, my name is Ty Matthews.

17:44.036 --> 17:45.971
I'm here to see Benjamin Green.

17:45.973 --> 17:47.875
Great, come here.

17:52.012 --> 17:54.378
Please wait for Mr.
Green in the office.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.949
Thank you.

18:02.656 --> 18:03.925
Yes, ready?

18:04.791 --> 18:06.894
Okay, thank you, dear.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.168
Ty Matthews!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.905
Have a seat, take a load off.

18:19.907 --> 18:22.741
This is a really,
really nice place

18:22.743 --> 18:23.808
you have here, Mr. Green.

18:23.810 --> 18:24.876
Thank you.

18:24.878 --> 18:26.177
You got a little butterfly there

18:26.179 --> 18:27.712
when he did a
little work on you.

18:27.714 --> 18:29.414
Yeah, it's just
part of the game.

18:29.416 --> 18:30.715
It is, yeah.

18:30.717 --> 18:33.818
Have you given any
thought to your future?

18:33.820 --> 18:35.252
I haven't yet.

18:35.254 --> 18:37.588
Well, I think you're
hell of a fighter.

18:37.590 --> 18:42.394
You got a lot to learn but
you got great potential.

18:42.396 --> 18:43.694
What are you saying?

18:43.696 --> 18:46.801
I'm saying I
like to manage you.

18:47.533 --> 18:48.369
Wow.

18:49.703 --> 18:51.839
I'm honored, Mr. Green.

18:53.439 --> 18:55.240
I think I'm gonna have
to stick with Pete.

18:55.242 --> 18:57.075
You know, I mean he's been
like a father figure to me

18:57.077 --> 19:00.712
and I think I'm gonna have
to roll with him on this.

19:00.714 --> 19:02.446
You sure about that?

19:02.448 --> 19:04.415
Yeah, I mean I'm
very appreciative

19:04.417 --> 19:07.585
but just feel like I
need to be loyal to Pete.

19:07.587 --> 19:09.553
No, I get that.

19:09.555 --> 19:13.625
Alright that just, so
there's no misunderstanding,

19:13.627 --> 19:16.364
here's $10,000 and there you go.

19:19.899 --> 19:21.199
What's that?

19:21.201 --> 19:22.899
Well, if you're
not on my team,

19:22.901 --> 19:24.269
you're against me.

19:24.271 --> 19:27.505
So, that's a
non-disclosure agreement.

19:27.507 --> 19:30.174
No lawsuits, no bullshit.

19:30.176 --> 19:33.744
That's it, you keep your
mouth shut about yesterday.

19:33.746 --> 19:34.814
Alright?

19:36.750 --> 19:38.482
Alright, what if I don't?

19:38.484 --> 19:40.152
Now.

19:40.154 --> 19:43.924
Then I'll say you got kicked
in the head once too often.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.292
What are you gonna benefit by
saying you got a sucker move

19:48.294 --> 19:52.030
that you used to get
Marco in a headlock?

19:52.032 --> 19:54.532
Rear naked choke
is a sucker move?

19:54.534 --> 19:58.537
I mean Marco used that in his
last title fight against Lake.

19:58.539 --> 20:01.173
Now listen to me, son.

20:01.175 --> 20:04.809
This is a billion
dollar industry.

20:04.811 --> 20:06.110
This is a business model.

20:06.112 --> 20:08.646
Now, Marco is up here

20:08.648 --> 20:11.284
and you, Ty, are way down here.

20:12.452 --> 20:14.752
And I can't have you
me meddling in things

20:14.754 --> 20:18.693
that are way, way beyond
your comprehension.

20:20.160 --> 20:23.627
Now, I don't care how
good a fighter you are.

20:23.629 --> 20:25.763
I can't have you
hemorrhage in my business

20:25.765 --> 20:28.867
over a stupid sparring match.

20:28.869 --> 20:30.434
Now, just sign that

20:30.436 --> 20:34.841
and I don't wanna hear
about yesterday ever again.

20:37.811 --> 20:39.312
How old are you?

20:40.379 --> 20:41.279
Hm?

20:41.281 --> 20:42.680
34.

20:42.682 --> 20:47.418
34, well I understand, I
see you're almost at the,

20:47.420 --> 20:49.087
the end of your prime.

20:49.089 --> 20:51.557
And you got something to prove

20:51.559 --> 20:53.090
and you haven't had a chance.

20:53.092 --> 20:56.029
But this can be your chance now.

20:56.696 --> 20:58.364
See, you just that.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.969
And I never wanna
hear about this again.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.741
Now, take the money, enjoy it.

21:24.558 --> 21:25.624
There are two copies.

21:25.626 --> 21:27.795
One for you, one for me.

21:32.599 --> 21:33.868
There you go.

21:38.504 --> 21:39.971
I'll take that one.

21:39.973 --> 21:41.673
Sign the other.

21:41.675 --> 21:42.542
Okay.

21:49.748 --> 21:50.817
Aisha!

21:51.551 --> 21:53.084
Who is this?

21:53.086 --> 21:55.319
You emailed
me about a story.

21:55.321 --> 21:56.855
Victoria?

21:56.857 --> 21:58.623
Are
we meeting or not?

21:58.625 --> 22:00.524
How about at Maly's, 10 o'clock?

22:00.526 --> 22:01.859
I can do that.

22:01.861 --> 22:03.494
Better
not be bullshitting me.

22:03.496 --> 22:05.563
I made Marco
Reign tap out.

22:05.565 --> 22:10.136
I'll see you
at Maly's, 10 o'clock sharp.

22:14.707 --> 22:18.876
I wish you would think
about getting a real job.

22:22.014 --> 22:24.749
Now, Marco is up here

22:24.751 --> 22:27.388
and you, Ty, are way down here.

22:31.992 --> 22:33.324
You think I
could've pulled that off

22:33.326 --> 22:34.658
in front of a thousand
screaming fans

22:34.660 --> 22:36.528
and a bunch TV cameras?

22:36.530 --> 22:38.061
I don't know, Ty.

22:38.063 --> 22:41.267
I mean, to him it
was just practice.

22:50.410 --> 22:54.347
I think you'd beat him
if it really counted.

23:24.077 --> 23:25.109
Ty.

23:25.111 --> 23:26.411
- Victoria.
- Yes.

23:26.413 --> 23:27.980
I didn't think
you gonna show up.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.079
I know, I am so
sorry that I'm late.

23:29.081 --> 23:31.449
Here, let's get a table.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.151
You wanna drink?

23:33.153 --> 23:34.421
Yeah, sure.

23:39.091 --> 23:40.325
Hi, what can I get you?

23:40.327 --> 23:41.492
Hi.

23:41.494 --> 23:44.796
I'll have a Scotch, neat
and whatever he wants.

23:44.798 --> 23:45.864
Buck on the rocks.

23:45.866 --> 23:46.731
Got it.

23:46.733 --> 23:47.967
Thank you.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.506
Thank you for waiting.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.243
No problem.

23:59.346 --> 24:01.279
I'm gonna be really honest.

24:01.281 --> 24:03.315
I know there are
a lot of fighters

24:03.317 --> 24:05.282
that are better
than the big names

24:05.284 --> 24:07.284
but they don't have
managers like Ben Green

24:07.286 --> 24:09.753
giving kickbacks to the league.

24:09.755 --> 24:12.624
He and I had a very
interesting conversation today.

24:12.626 --> 24:13.657
Yeah?

24:13.659 --> 24:14.527
Yeah.

24:26.807 --> 24:29.773
I think this story
is the first step

24:29.775 --> 24:32.111
to change the entire game.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.519
For the record.

24:43.122 --> 24:44.190
Cool.

24:47.060 --> 24:48.359
Here you go.

24:48.361 --> 24:49.493
Thank you.

24:49.495 --> 24:50.363
Thanks.

24:54.701 --> 24:56.303
So, Ty Matthews.

24:57.471 --> 25:01.039
Now that was a sparring
session, not a real fight?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.607
No, I'd beat him
in a real fight.

25:02.609 --> 25:04.809
Oh yeah, what
makes you think so?

25:04.811 --> 25:06.211
Look, there are guys

25:06.213 --> 25:07.811
that don't even wanna
lose in practice.

25:07.813 --> 25:09.350
He's one of them.

25:10.650 --> 25:12.216
Got a little too cocky.

25:12.218 --> 25:14.118
I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.953
That must've felt good.

25:16.955 --> 25:18.990
Better than sex.

25:18.992 --> 25:21.425
Could you describe that?

25:21.427 --> 25:23.296
The fight or sex?

25:24.230 --> 25:25.829
Whatever you prefer.

25:28.267 --> 25:31.703
Well, I prefer not
to talk about sex.

25:31.705 --> 25:32.606
Why not?

25:33.674 --> 25:37.008
I don't think my girlfriend
would like it too much.

25:37.010 --> 25:39.546
Ah, so you've a girlfriend.

25:41.982 --> 25:43.050
Yeah.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.620
You don't seem too
happy about that.

25:48.655 --> 25:50.588
No, I love her.

25:50.590 --> 25:53.857
It just we're not on the
best terms right now.

25:53.859 --> 25:55.292
Okay.

25:55.294 --> 25:58.096
So, we have to talk
about something else.

25:58.098 --> 26:02.636
Let's talk about how I think
you need another drink.

26:10.342 --> 26:13.144
Yeah, I don't know
where I'd be without him.

26:13.146 --> 26:14.479
How did you two meet?

26:14.481 --> 26:17.284
Have you known him
most of your life?

26:19.185 --> 26:21.655
My mom died when I was 13.

26:22.789 --> 26:27.194
Pete took me when I ran
away from a foster care.

26:30.129 --> 26:34.667
Well, he sounds more like
a father than a trainer.

26:37.102 --> 26:38.502
Yeah.

26:38.504 --> 26:40.437
When I had nowhere
to go, he took me in.

26:40.439 --> 26:42.542
Gave me job at the gym.

26:43.476 --> 26:46.280
And he taught me how to fight.

26:48.215 --> 26:51.648
I'll probably in jail
if wasn't for him.

26:51.650 --> 26:52.652
I'm sorry.

26:55.888 --> 26:57.090
It's okay.

27:00.627 --> 27:04.697
I think you should show
me how you beat Marco.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.732
I can't show
people that video.

27:08.734 --> 27:11.569
But I can have my guy
from the gym show you.

27:11.571 --> 27:13.271
Well, I don't
wanna see the video

27:13.273 --> 27:15.940
and I don't want your friend
at the gym to show me either.

27:15.942 --> 27:17.845
I want you to show me.

27:20.446 --> 27:21.378
Right here?

27:21.380 --> 27:23.180
Yeah, right here.

27:23.182 --> 27:24.048
No.

27:24.050 --> 27:25.081
Yeah.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.186
I want you to show me.

27:31.823 --> 27:33.324
You know you gonna
get me thrown in jail

27:33.326 --> 27:34.759
for doing it
especially like this?

27:34.761 --> 27:38.465
You know I'll keep
your ass out of jail.

27:42.568 --> 27:46.104
Don't be a pussy, you can do it.

27:46.106 --> 27:46.971
Don't be a pussy?

27:46.973 --> 27:47.840
Mm-hm.

27:49.609 --> 27:52.245
I knew that would do to you.

27:56.750 --> 28:01.286
So, I slid my arm
around his neck like this.

28:01.288 --> 28:04.655
This is called a
rear naked choke.

28:04.657 --> 28:07.461
Well, I like the name of it.

28:08.994 --> 28:10.994
Then I grab my own bicep.

28:10.996 --> 28:12.496
Uh-huh.

28:12.498 --> 28:14.598
And lock my hand behind
his head like this.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.265
Yeah?

28:15.267 --> 28:16.335
Yeah.

28:17.136 --> 28:19.302
Just like this?

28:19.304 --> 28:21.374
Just like this.

28:22.675 --> 28:25.913
So, is this as
hard as you can go?

28:29.148 --> 28:30.751
I can go harder.

29:52.232 --> 29:53.463
I want you to choke me.

29:53.465 --> 29:55.265
- Yeah.
- Here.

29:55.267 --> 29:56.934
Harder.

29:56.936 --> 29:58.101
Harder.

34:05.784 --> 34:07.119
You're home.

34:08.353 --> 34:09.822
What time is it?

34:16.728 --> 34:18.598
12:30, something.

34:22.768 --> 34:23.969
Come here.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.371
Ugh.

34:28.373 --> 34:30.775
Baby, you stink like booze.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.179
Where were you?

34:35.047 --> 34:37.581
I went out with
Pete for a drink.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.451
And he got wasted and
spilled vodka all over me.

34:40.453 --> 34:41.819
I mean how you that old

34:41.821 --> 34:44.355
and you still can't
hold your liquor?

34:44.357 --> 34:45.621
That's crazy, right?

34:45.623 --> 34:46.659
Crazy.

34:50.196 --> 34:52.529
I don't even recognize
this face anymore

34:52.531 --> 34:54.766
without cuts and bruises.

34:59.272 --> 35:00.306
I love you.

35:03.076 --> 35:03.944
I know.

35:06.846 --> 35:08.844
I'm gonna take a shower.

35:08.846 --> 35:10.583
Yeah.

35:57.529 --> 35:59.496
Beneath your
head from like that.

35:59.498 --> 36:00.367
Yeah.

36:25.525 --> 36:27.661
I can still smell it.

36:49.848 --> 36:51.114
Hey.

36:51.116 --> 36:53.585
Where can I find Peter Mack?

36:54.520 --> 36:56.487
You could find him
in the back somewhere.

36:56.489 --> 36:58.623
Alright,
what's he look like?

36:58.625 --> 37:01.226
Black guy, red jacket.

37:03.161 --> 37:05.061
What happened to your ear?

37:05.063 --> 37:08.098
Man, I was getting down
with this chick, right.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.400
She's hot too she used
to being grab my ear

37:10.402 --> 37:11.768
and scratch my shit.

37:11.770 --> 37:13.369
Maybe you shouldn't been
put in on her like that.

37:13.371 --> 37:15.072
Come on now, you know
how I gotta rip with zip

37:15.074 --> 37:16.139
for the team, right?

37:16.141 --> 37:17.042
Come on.

37:20.679 --> 37:21.815
Who's that?

37:23.882 --> 37:25.284
I don't know.

37:27.185 --> 37:29.955
Probably that's your boyfriend.

37:30.723 --> 37:32.588
Your Peter Mack?

37:32.590 --> 37:33.791
Yeah, why?

37:33.793 --> 37:35.192
You own this place?

37:35.194 --> 37:37.061
How can I help you?

37:37.063 --> 37:39.128
I'm looking for Ty Matthews.

37:39.130 --> 37:42.099
He working out here today?

37:42.101 --> 37:44.235
What did he do?

37:44.237 --> 37:47.103
Oh, I can't say
but off the record,

37:47.105 --> 37:50.273
I think it has to
do with a lady.

37:50.275 --> 37:53.744
I think a lady has a gripe
and I gotta follow through.

37:53.746 --> 37:56.112
So Ty, my goodness.

37:56.114 --> 37:57.547
Ty and the ladies.

37:57.549 --> 37:58.648
Yeah, well.

37:58.650 --> 38:00.016
Come on, I'll introduce you.

38:00.018 --> 38:03.223
Don't tell me don't
miss those days.

38:04.556 --> 38:05.390
Yeah.

38:06.525 --> 38:09.759
Hey Ty, this mas has a
few questions for you.

38:09.761 --> 38:12.164
Ty Matthews, how are you?

38:12.998 --> 38:14.933
Yeah, who are you?

38:16.335 --> 38:18.536
I'm Detective John Beckett.

38:18.538 --> 38:20.837
I just got a couple
of questions.

38:20.839 --> 38:22.374
If you don't mind.

38:23.076 --> 38:25.108
Pete, what's this all about?

38:25.110 --> 38:26.476
You tell me.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.114
No, it's alright.

38:29.114 --> 38:30.646
I'd rather not talk here.

38:30.648 --> 38:32.016
I'd rather go to somewhere
a little more private

38:32.018 --> 38:33.583
like down in my office.

38:33.585 --> 38:35.453
I'll be back inside an hour.

38:35.455 --> 38:38.958
If you wanna come
talk to me, 'right.

38:42.161 --> 38:43.963
You don't have to.

38:44.630 --> 38:46.099
It's unofficial.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.101
But you'll help me out.

38:53.572 --> 38:55.041
Fucking asshole.

38:57.042 --> 38:58.277
Not you, me.

39:00.712 --> 39:02.579
You can't have this up here.

39:02.581 --> 39:06.319
I was supposed to
check it in downstairs.

39:10.922 --> 39:13.690
Have your permission
to look inside?

39:13.692 --> 39:17.927
Otherwise, I gotta go
downstairs and check it up.

39:17.929 --> 39:19.031
Sure.

39:22.567 --> 39:25.069
Are there scissors
here or anything sharp?

39:25.071 --> 39:26.936
Knife or razor blade
and where you cut?

39:26.938 --> 39:27.973
No.

39:29.708 --> 39:30.877
You know.

39:31.810 --> 39:34.478
I got this ex-partner, Jimmy.

39:34.480 --> 39:37.748
He's obsessed with
Asian culture, you know.

39:37.750 --> 39:42.288
Like tai chi, martial arts,
married an Asian girl.

39:43.389 --> 39:47.560
Anyway, he's got me drinking
32 ounces of warm water

39:49.228 --> 39:51.128
everyday when I wake up.

39:51.130 --> 39:54.834
I've been doing it for
like four weeks now.

39:55.735 --> 39:59.036
The philosophy or the
ideology behind it

39:59.038 --> 40:02.072
is that your body
has been sleeping

40:02.074 --> 40:05.208
for four, six, eight,
10 hours a night, right?

40:05.210 --> 40:08.478
You're completely
dehydrated when you wake up.

40:08.480 --> 40:10.380
So, this, when you
drink the water,

40:10.382 --> 40:12.616
it kick starts your
system and reboots it

40:12.618 --> 40:14.317
and I'm telling you,

40:14.319 --> 40:15.985
it flushes your whole system
because nothing in your body,

40:15.987 --> 40:18.355
nothing there, it's like a
plunger, the water goes down,

40:18.357 --> 40:20.190
everything out,
everything clean.

40:20.192 --> 40:24.128
Hey, what is this
have to do with me?

40:24.130 --> 40:25.198
Nothing.

40:26.531 --> 40:27.864
I figured since you
were an athlete,

40:27.866 --> 40:30.102
maybe you heard of that.

40:33.272 --> 40:35.340
You're a boxer, right?

40:37.643 --> 40:39.875
No, I practice MMA.

40:39.877 --> 40:41.313
Practice MMA.

40:42.214 --> 40:45.351
You hit people
for a living, yeah?

40:46.317 --> 40:47.985
You could say that.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.688
Would you say that
you're a violent person?

40:50.690 --> 40:52.188
But man, what's
this all about?

40:52.190 --> 40:54.824
Do I need a attorney
or something?

40:54.826 --> 40:56.694
I don't know.

40:56.696 --> 40:57.563
Do you?

41:05.170 --> 41:07.971
So, Ty Matthews.

41:07.973 --> 41:12.141
So that was just a sparring
session, not a real fight?

41:12.143 --> 41:13.511
I would beat
him in a real fight.

41:13.513 --> 41:15.478
Oh yeah,
what makes you think so?

41:15.480 --> 41:17.081
Look, there's some guys

41:17.083 --> 41:18.315
that don't even wanna
lose in practice.

41:18.317 --> 41:20.349
He's one of them.

41:20.351 --> 41:21.719
He got a little too cocky.

41:21.721 --> 41:24.154
I saw an opportunity
and I took it.

41:24.156 --> 41:27.190
That
must've felt good.

41:27.192 --> 41:29.227
Better than sex.

41:33.331 --> 41:35.467
That's Victoria Mata,

41:36.802 --> 41:40.036
was voice you heard on the tape.

41:40.038 --> 41:41.707
You know her right?

41:42.975 --> 41:44.074
Yeah.

41:44.076 --> 41:47.009
What time was the interview?

41:47.011 --> 41:48.378
10 p.m.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.047
What did you do
after the interview?

41:50.049 --> 41:51.014
I went home.

41:51.016 --> 41:52.282
What time was that?

41:52.284 --> 41:53.150
Fuck, man.

41:53.152 --> 41:54.150
I don't know.

41:54.152 --> 41:55.554
Think.

41:56.822 --> 41:58.657
I go home at 12:30.

42:00.692 --> 42:03.960
You can ask my girl,
she'll vouch for me.

42:03.962 --> 42:06.963
But the meeting with
Victoria start was at 10 p.m.

42:06.965 --> 42:09.666
She was a little late.

42:09.668 --> 42:10.933
Tell me.

42:10.935 --> 42:12.335
The tape's only 30 minutes long,

42:12.337 --> 42:15.741
what did you do in
the rest of the time?

42:19.377 --> 42:21.411
She's a good looking girl.

42:21.413 --> 42:24.415
Have a predilection
for fighters.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.552
Maybe she added you up.

42:28.520 --> 42:32.889
Flirted with you a little
bit, touched your leg.

42:32.891 --> 42:35.726
You guys got a little
liquored up, maybe.

42:35.728 --> 42:38.594
And she takes ya home
back home to her place

42:38.596 --> 42:40.529
and things get out of hand.

42:40.531 --> 42:43.368
One thing leads to another and.

42:45.337 --> 42:48.137
What are you talking about?

42:48.139 --> 42:50.174
Well, a predilection
for fighters

42:50.176 --> 42:51.141
means that she liked you.

42:51.143 --> 42:52.009
She had a thing for...

42:52.011 --> 42:53.409
No, no man.

42:53.411 --> 42:56.815
What do you mean things
things got out of hand?

43:06.225 --> 43:08.358
She was
strangled to death.

43:08.360 --> 43:09.226
She's dead?

43:12.297 --> 43:14.598
Do you think I killed her?

43:14.600 --> 43:16.233
I don't know.

43:16.235 --> 43:17.601
Why would I kill her?

43:17.603 --> 43:18.771
I don't know.

43:20.605 --> 43:24.574
What was that thing
you said on the tape?

43:24.576 --> 43:28.414
You said winning a fight
is better than sex.

43:31.083 --> 43:32.351
Is that true?

43:38.456 --> 43:42.328
Speaking of hydration,
I gotta take a piss.

43:44.196 --> 43:46.299
Can I get you anything?

43:52.069 --> 43:53.171
No.

43:58.344 --> 44:01.777
Emmy set time of death
somewhere around 3 a.m.

44:01.779 --> 44:03.079
Cause of death?

44:03.081 --> 44:04.348
She was strangled.

44:04.350 --> 44:05.616
The guy's an MMA fighter.

44:05.618 --> 44:06.951
Anything
else like DNA,

44:06.953 --> 44:08.351
tissues, semen in the victim?

44:08.353 --> 44:09.418
We'll have it later tonight.

44:09.420 --> 44:11.454
Forensics is working on it.

44:11.456 --> 44:12.621
How about
the girlfriend?

44:12.623 --> 44:14.558
She works at a nail salon,

44:14.560 --> 44:16.326
I'm gonna go talk to her now.

44:16.328 --> 44:17.194
You know it just works.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.264
Get to it.

44:25.103 --> 44:27.103
I know what you did.

44:27.105 --> 44:28.505
You know what you did

44:28.507 --> 44:31.144
so let's just cut the shit.

44:34.078 --> 44:35.612
I didn't do anything.

44:35.614 --> 44:38.150
You at least fucked her.

44:38.984 --> 44:40.884
That much is for sure.

44:40.886 --> 44:42.219
What do you mean?

44:42.221 --> 44:43.587
Are you gonna sit
here and tell me

44:43.589 --> 44:46.255
that nothing happened
between you two?

44:46.257 --> 44:47.690
I mean she interviewed me.

44:47.692 --> 44:49.092
That's about it.

44:49.094 --> 44:51.061
How'd you do it?

44:51.063 --> 44:52.561
Huh?

44:52.563 --> 44:53.864
You get to do things to her

44:53.866 --> 44:57.170
that your girlfriend
won't let you?

44:58.804 --> 45:01.840
That's how it
happened, isn't it?

45:04.275 --> 45:07.009
I'm not saying
another word to you.

45:07.011 --> 45:08.978
And where's my phone call?

45:08.980 --> 45:10.512
I wanna call my trainer.

45:10.514 --> 45:13.451
You can call whoever you want.

45:18.156 --> 45:20.424
But just so you know, Ty,

45:21.659 --> 45:25.931
I will find out exactly
what happened eventually.

45:30.302 --> 45:32.405
Enjoy your phone call.

45:39.310 --> 45:40.412
Yeah?

45:41.779 --> 45:42.781
Hanged up.

45:47.319 --> 45:49.251
Whitney?

45:49.253 --> 45:50.320
Yeah.

45:50.322 --> 45:52.188
I need to speak with you?

45:52.190 --> 45:53.523
I'm on my break, actually

45:53.525 --> 45:55.025
but one of the other
girls can help you out.

45:55.027 --> 45:59.432
This is regarding your
boyfriend, Ty Matthews.

46:05.770 --> 46:08.572
So you said he was home
right around 12:30.

46:08.574 --> 46:12.675
So, would you say
definitely before 1 a.m.?

46:12.677 --> 46:15.344
Yeah, he was definitely home.

46:15.346 --> 46:16.448
Okay.

46:18.350 --> 46:20.018
Is he in trouble?

46:21.119 --> 46:22.455
He might be.

46:31.330 --> 46:32.665
Is that blood?

46:33.364 --> 46:34.466
What?

46:35.232 --> 46:36.701
On your shirt.

46:39.036 --> 46:40.503
Oh, yeah.

46:40.505 --> 46:44.541
I always get blood on
me from patching up Ty.

46:44.543 --> 46:46.076
It's old.

46:46.078 --> 46:48.779
Does Ty have any
new cuts on his face

46:48.781 --> 46:51.748
or anywhere on him last night?

46:51.750 --> 46:54.918
Ty has new cuts every night.

46:54.920 --> 46:58.020
Have you told in there
what you just told me?

46:58.022 --> 47:00.824
What, that I slept
with the reporter?

47:00.826 --> 47:01.694
No.

47:03.094 --> 47:03.962
Not yet.

47:05.998 --> 47:07.864
But Whitney's my girl.

47:07.866 --> 47:09.302
And I love her.

47:10.469 --> 47:11.768
But it felt good to
have somebody care

47:11.770 --> 47:14.507
'bout what I do for a change.

47:17.342 --> 47:21.913
Do you want me to drive
you home or somewhere else?

47:29.888 --> 47:30.822
Not home.

47:31.755 --> 47:35.393
Listen, you have to
open up to Whitney.

47:40.264 --> 47:44.233
Well, thank you very much,
Whitney, for your time.

47:44.235 --> 47:48.773
Give me a call if you think
you have anything else.

48:33.152 --> 48:34.019
3:36.

48:35.920 --> 48:36.754
3:36?

48:37.656 --> 48:40.726
You got home
last night at 3:36.

48:44.996 --> 48:47.630
Some detective came
to my job today.

48:47.632 --> 48:51.101
Want to know what
time you got home.

48:51.103 --> 48:52.402
What did you say?

48:52.404 --> 48:53.672
I lied, Ty.

48:54.505 --> 48:55.804
To the police.

48:55.806 --> 48:58.243
Trying to protect your ass.

48:59.143 --> 49:03.380
So won't you tell me
where you really where?

49:03.382 --> 49:05.117
Oh, just sit down.

49:07.152 --> 49:09.186
I think I'm gonna
stand right here

49:09.188 --> 49:13.459
and let you tell me what
the fuck is going on.

49:18.029 --> 49:19.661
I met with a reporter
that wanted to do

49:19.663 --> 49:21.931
a story on me beating Marco.

49:21.933 --> 49:24.867
You beating Marco in practice?

49:24.869 --> 49:25.770
Yeah.

49:26.471 --> 49:28.337
Then Ben Green gave me $10,000

49:28.339 --> 49:30.540
not to post the video
of me beating Marco.

49:30.542 --> 49:32.409
Who the hell is Ben Green?

49:32.411 --> 49:34.547
He's Marco's manager.

49:38.417 --> 49:40.185
Check the dresser.

49:41.685 --> 49:43.655
Go on, bottom drawer.

50:14.652 --> 50:17.219
Why didn't you just tell me?

50:17.221 --> 50:20.590
Well, Green paid
me to shut my mouth.

50:20.592 --> 50:23.025
Okay, I even had
to sign this thing.

50:23.027 --> 50:24.860
This does not change the fact

50:24.862 --> 50:28.332
that I had to lie to
the police for you.

50:29.301 --> 50:31.900
And what is this
thing you signed?

50:31.902 --> 50:35.107
We can't take this
guy suing us, Ty.

50:36.208 --> 50:37.876
She was murdered.

50:39.043 --> 50:44.047
Alright baby, the reporter
I talked to, she's dead.

50:44.049 --> 50:44.917
God.

50:47.485 --> 50:49.955
Police think I killed her.

50:58.630 --> 51:00.329
Come on, Whitney.

51:00.331 --> 51:02.498
I've done a lot of
fucked up shit in my life

51:02.500 --> 51:04.302
but I'm not a killer.

51:08.072 --> 51:11.777
But something happened
between you two.

51:13.511 --> 51:14.580
Right?

51:28.259 --> 51:29.793
I gotta go.

51:29.795 --> 51:32.865
Alright, I gotta
go clear my head.

51:35.199 --> 51:38.937
Look, when I come
back, we can talk more.

51:40.772 --> 51:42.775
Just know I love you.

51:44.676 --> 51:45.777
Very much.

51:48.212 --> 51:52.348
I will never do anything
to hurt our relationship.

51:52.350 --> 51:53.217
Okay?

52:08.634 --> 52:09.833
And here we are.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.867
Here we are, the final fight.

52:11.869 --> 52:14.471
The final round, round five.

52:14.473 --> 52:16.708
Del Toro and Marco Reign.

52:17.810 --> 52:20.610
Fighters, they're at it again.

52:20.612 --> 52:22.348
They're at it again.

52:25.850 --> 52:27.983
Where
are you from, baby?

52:27.985 --> 52:32.554
Yeah she worked hard
for that much, she worked hard.

52:32.556 --> 52:33.723
Yeah baby.

52:33.725 --> 52:35.860
Give her that teaser.

52:37.328 --> 52:38.397
Whoa, whoa.

52:40.632 --> 52:42.632
Oh, we got it.

52:42.634 --> 52:43.498
Alright boys, shots?

52:43.500 --> 52:44.599
More rounds?

52:44.601 --> 52:46.138
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:47.339 --> 52:48.737
I'll get that.

52:48.739 --> 52:50.708
Be right back, boys.

52:53.110 --> 52:55.076
Let me get out three
shots of whiskey

52:55.078 --> 52:57.547
for that losers over there.

52:57.549 --> 52:58.947
Get the fuck outta here!

52:58.949 --> 52:59.815
Of course.

52:59.817 --> 53:01.152
Just a minute.

53:02.621 --> 53:05.054
Can you believe this fight?

53:05.056 --> 53:08.757
Those guys over there,
they bet for the other guy.

53:08.759 --> 53:10.793
Nobody beats Marco Reign.

53:10.795 --> 53:12.998
It's my guy right there.

53:16.835 --> 53:18.367
I did.

53:18.369 --> 53:20.038
What did you say?

53:24.042 --> 53:26.110
Did you say somethin'?

53:30.482 --> 53:31.817
Speak up, boy.

53:36.788 --> 53:38.857
That's what I thought.

53:43.527 --> 53:44.897
I said I did.

53:46.498 --> 53:47.596
Hold up, boys, hold up.

53:47.598 --> 53:48.766
I got this.

53:50.935 --> 53:55.206
Take your fucking drink,
get the fuck outta here.

54:01.212 --> 54:04.145
Talking shit talkers, boys.

54:04.147 --> 54:06.815
Think they can hit the gym,

54:06.817 --> 54:09.085
think they can fight.

54:09.087 --> 54:10.152
I would whoop up his ass.

54:10.154 --> 54:11.621
Talk smart, Boomer.

54:11.623 --> 54:14.991
Trying to mess up
our festivities here.

54:14.993 --> 54:16.358
Nah, not
tonight, Boomer.

54:16.360 --> 54:18.829
Doesn't he know
this is what we do?

54:18.831 --> 54:21.130
He sustained wounds,
his first puck.

54:21.132 --> 54:25.069
Come on, now get the
fuck outta here, man.

54:27.505 --> 54:30.873
Let me ask you something,
you work on Tuesdays?

54:30.875 --> 54:34.643
Yeah, I work here
almost every night.

54:34.645 --> 54:37.246
You have to see her before?

54:37.248 --> 54:39.049
Yeah, she was here
the other night,

54:39.051 --> 54:42.054
sitting over there
with some guy.

54:43.788 --> 54:44.956
This guy?

54:57.634 --> 54:58.803
Boy, huh?

54:59.737 --> 55:00.936
Fucking cocksucker!

55:02.340 --> 55:03.471
Fuck you boy.

55:03.473 --> 55:04.976
Motherfucker-doo.

55:12.150 --> 55:15.016
I'm not giving this
gym rat a fight on TV.

55:15.018 --> 55:18.256
Five million
dollars said you will.

55:20.023 --> 55:21.090
You think?

55:21.092 --> 55:22.425
You'll make more on this fight

55:22.427 --> 55:23.994
than the last three
fights combined.

55:23.996 --> 55:27.866
Where are you gonna
make that kind of money?

55:28.766 --> 55:30.235
I got an idea.

55:31.969 --> 55:33.501
Oh shit!

55:33.503 --> 55:36.338
I couldn't help but the
notice the kinky shud.

55:36.340 --> 55:37.572
A kinky shud?

55:37.574 --> 55:38.442
Kinky how?

55:39.377 --> 55:41.643
Like at one point,
he came from behind her

55:41.645 --> 55:43.679
and like had his
arm around her neck.

55:43.681 --> 55:46.248
It's a little weird but
didn't make anything other,

55:46.250 --> 55:48.586
and it looked she like it.

55:49.786 --> 55:51.520
They leave together?

55:51.522 --> 55:52.755
Yeah.

55:54.692 --> 55:56.826
If you hear anything else,

55:56.828 --> 55:59.163
if you remember something,

56:01.565 --> 56:03.000
please call me.

56:05.636 --> 56:06.504
Ugh.

56:39.203 --> 56:40.969
Hey Jameson,
what are you doing?

56:40.971 --> 56:42.605
Look
at you superstar.

56:42.607 --> 56:43.840
Almost a million views.

56:43.842 --> 56:44.907
Yeah, I sign
something that's saying

56:44.909 --> 56:46.375
I couldn't post that video.

56:46.377 --> 56:47.744
Oh man, my bad.

56:47.746 --> 56:49.978
Just want people to know
who the real champ is.

56:49.980 --> 56:52.116
You ain't mad, are you?

56:54.685 --> 56:56.154
I woke you up?

56:56.955 --> 56:58.023
I'm sorry.

56:58.857 --> 57:00.489
Kit came back.

57:00.491 --> 57:04.226
Yeah, Ty's DNA matches
the semen found in Mata.

57:04.228 --> 57:06.295
What time did they
leave the bar that night?

57:06.297 --> 57:07.862
The server said late.

57:07.864 --> 57:09.965
So they flirted pretty heavily.

57:09.967 --> 57:12.170
He's our guy, I know it.

57:12.871 --> 57:15.107
His woman is lying to us.

57:16.007 --> 57:18.007
Let me go talk to her.

57:18.009 --> 57:20.076
You know, girl to girl.

57:20.078 --> 57:21.146
Okay.

57:28.386 --> 57:29.117
Hey.

57:29.119 --> 57:30.989
Hey Ty, Ty Matthews?

57:31.922 --> 57:33.021
Can I help you?

57:33.023 --> 57:34.623
Sure and you certainly can.

57:34.625 --> 57:36.391
I am doing a piece on you
for the National Tribune.

57:36.393 --> 57:39.427
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

57:39.429 --> 57:41.431
May take a few
minutes of your time?

57:41.433 --> 57:42.665
Hey Ty!

57:42.667 --> 57:43.733
Yeah?

57:43.735 --> 57:44.666
Please forget about the woman.

57:44.668 --> 57:45.601
Come, come with me!

57:45.603 --> 57:46.969
Comin' now, Pete.

57:46.971 --> 57:48.237
Hey, you know, maybe we
should this another time.

57:48.239 --> 57:49.304
Okay, well here's my contact.

57:49.306 --> 57:51.574
Just call me, stay in touch.

57:51.576 --> 57:52.340
Okay.

57:52.342 --> 57:53.141
Promise?

57:53.143 --> 57:54.312
Ty!

57:58.382 --> 58:01.986
Close the door
behind you, would you?

58:07.657 --> 58:09.127
Liked the video.

58:11.161 --> 58:13.429
Well, I guess you
want your money back.

58:13.431 --> 58:16.065
No, not necessarily.

58:16.067 --> 58:17.866
Marco liked it.

58:17.868 --> 58:20.604
So the two million other people.

58:24.241 --> 58:26.677
Thank you for meeting me.

58:27.645 --> 58:28.612
Have a seat.

58:31.049 --> 58:34.052
Can I get you
something to drink?

58:35.520 --> 58:39.054
Are you trying to tell
me that I'll need one?

58:39.056 --> 58:39.924
Maybe.

58:41.025 --> 58:45.094
So how does a hundred
thousand dollars sound to you?

58:45.096 --> 58:46.929
Sounds like a lot of money.

58:46.931 --> 58:48.297
Well, congratulations.

58:48.299 --> 58:50.701
This is your lucky day, Ty.

58:52.536 --> 58:56.574
They want you to fight
Marco for the title.

58:58.476 --> 59:00.509
Finally get your
fight with Marco.

59:00.511 --> 59:01.242
When?

59:01.244 --> 59:02.478
Two weeks.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.681
Our event, our rules.

59:04.683 --> 59:07.116
You know that's not
enough time for anyone

59:07.118 --> 59:09.018
to be ready for a
fight like this.

59:09.020 --> 59:10.253
Yes, it is.

59:11.255 --> 59:14.523
You think Ty
killed that reporter?

59:14.525 --> 59:16.728
I don't know if he did.

59:17.527 --> 59:20.498
He maybe has a legitimate alibi.

59:21.933 --> 59:26.505
I will beat him anytime, any
rules, any place, whenever.

59:27.973 --> 59:30.574
I was hoping you'd day that.

59:32.842 --> 59:34.446
Do we have a deal?

59:37.681 --> 59:38.549
Whitney.

59:42.987 --> 59:45.753
I know this isn't easy for you.

59:45.755 --> 59:48.958
But you know why I
brought you here?

59:48.960 --> 59:53.429
I brought you to this bar
because this is the last place

59:53.431 --> 59:56.368
Victoria was seen alive with Ty.

59:58.034 --> 59:59.136
Right here.

01:00:00.804 --> 01:00:02.808
This seat in particular.

01:00:05.476 --> 01:00:10.079
This is where Ty sat the
night she died and you,

01:00:10.081 --> 01:00:14.449
Whitney, you were seating
where Victoria sat.

01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:16.518
I'll have to send
the details over later.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:19.121
Pete, I assume
you're his manager.

01:00:19.123 --> 01:00:20.857
Well, I have to discuss...

01:00:20.859 --> 01:00:21.726
Yeah.

01:00:23.661 --> 01:00:25.130
He's my manager.

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:27.462
Well, good.

01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:29.200
I will leave you.

01:00:31.536 --> 01:00:34.606
You guys have a
lot of work to do.

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:41.146
Got a title fight, Pete.

01:00:43.581 --> 01:00:46.184
And then he reached over.

01:00:47.685 --> 01:00:49.186
Kinda like this.

01:00:51.288 --> 01:00:54.758
And he brushed the
hair off of her face.

01:00:57.161 --> 01:00:59.494
He had sex with her.

01:00:59.496 --> 01:01:03.768
His DNA matches the semen
we found inside of her.

01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:10.341
This man, he isn't
who you think he is.

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.679
He's dangerous.

01:01:18.014 --> 01:01:20.482
The man that you sleep next to,

01:01:20.484 --> 01:01:22.487
that man is a killer.

01:01:24.288 --> 01:01:26.157
So let me help you.

01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:31.495
Are you sure that Ty
was home by 12:30?

01:02:09.299 --> 01:02:12.535
What's
the matter, baby?

01:02:13.737 --> 01:02:18.276
I'm getting a hundred
thousand dollars to fight Marco.

01:02:24.181 --> 01:02:25.516
You serious?

01:02:30.054 --> 01:02:31.654
I can't leave it, babe.

01:02:31.656 --> 01:02:32.556
Yeah.

01:02:45.002 --> 01:02:48.672
I've been waiting
my whole life,

01:02:49.473 --> 01:02:51.308
for a title fight.

01:02:59.949 --> 01:03:00.884
It's crazy.

01:03:51.368 --> 01:03:52.904
Are you scared?

01:03:54.038 --> 01:03:54.906
Ty.

01:04:01.779 --> 01:04:04.179
This is what you want?

01:04:04.181 --> 01:04:05.449
Yeah, harder.

01:04:07.118 --> 01:04:07.985
Harder.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.522
Choke me.

01:04:11.956 --> 01:04:15.694
Choke me like you
choked that white girl.

01:04:18.395 --> 01:04:20.064
What did you say?

01:04:56.299 --> 01:04:57.368
Whitney.

01:04:59.203 --> 01:05:00.538
What was that?

01:05:05.409 --> 01:05:07.479
You know I love you.

01:05:13.016 --> 01:05:16.020
More than anything
in this world.

01:05:17.355 --> 01:05:18.887
I love you too, baby.

01:05:18.889 --> 01:05:21.590
Then why would you fuck her?

01:05:21.592 --> 01:05:22.660
Jesus, Ty.

01:05:31.969 --> 01:05:34.973
They found your
semen inside her.

01:05:36.773 --> 01:05:38.676
And now she's dead.

01:05:41.078 --> 01:05:42.413
I messed up.

01:05:44.514 --> 01:05:47.315
Okay, I just wanted
her to do a story on me

01:05:47.317 --> 01:05:48.416
and she kept comin' on to me.

01:05:48.418 --> 01:05:50.955
Right, it's poor fucking Ty!

01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:53.023
Right?

01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:57.561
It's always somebody
else's fault.

01:06:01.264 --> 01:06:03.600
I wish you had killed her.

01:06:06.369 --> 01:06:07.235
Come on, Whitney.

01:06:07.237 --> 01:06:08.103
No.

01:06:08.105 --> 01:06:08.973
Funny, no!

01:06:11.141 --> 01:06:12.043
Don't.

01:06:18.415 --> 01:06:20.651
Good luck on your fight,

01:06:22.786 --> 01:06:26.420
and just stay the
fuck away from me.

01:06:26.422 --> 01:06:27.524
Just.

01:06:59.723 --> 01:07:01.992
How do you get in here?

01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:08.063
Pete, I've been breaking in
this place since I was a kid.

01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:09.199
Take a rest.

01:07:12.469 --> 01:07:14.270
I'ma beat Reign.

01:07:17.808 --> 01:07:20.241
I already beat him once.

01:07:20.243 --> 01:07:23.744
Green tried to scare
me but I don't care.

01:07:23.746 --> 01:07:25.313
I'm gonna beat that fool again,

01:07:25.315 --> 01:07:27.616
but this time, the whole
world's gonna see it.

01:07:33.223 --> 01:07:34.489
But I need your help.

01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:37.125
You know I will help you.

01:07:37.127 --> 01:07:38.128
I really do.

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:42.831
But I have to know
something first.

01:07:42.833 --> 01:07:44.167
Did you do it?

01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:46.003
Not you.

01:07:47.371 --> 01:07:48.235
Are you serious?

01:07:48.237 --> 01:07:49.837
Not you too.

01:07:49.839 --> 01:07:52.107
I have to know, Ty.

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:55.476
How can you ask me
something like that?

01:07:55.478 --> 01:07:58.947
I mean do you really
think I killed this girl?

01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:01.583
You got to see
this from my side.

01:08:01.585 --> 01:08:04.719
I have the cops comin' in
here telling me one thing,

01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:05.820
Green, telling me another.

01:08:05.822 --> 01:08:08.625
What the fuck did Green say?

01:08:09.493 --> 01:08:12.328
I just have to hear from you.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:13.665
What happened?

01:08:15.767 --> 01:08:17.399
What do you think happened?

01:08:17.401 --> 01:08:19.533
Just can't imagine
you would kill that girl

01:08:19.535 --> 01:08:20.667
but I don't know.

01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:22.069
This is crazy!

01:08:22.072 --> 01:08:24.642
So fucking thing is crazy!

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:27.710
Listen, Ty.

01:08:27.712 --> 01:08:28.877
You've been like
a son to me but...

01:08:28.879 --> 01:08:31.645
Go fuck yourself, Pete.

01:08:31.647 --> 01:08:33.183
Go fuck yourself.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:36.988
Ty!

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.350
Unless she ask me
what I had on him.

01:09:10.353 --> 01:09:11.420
I had it hard on him.

01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:12.755
And I know you can smell it.

01:09:13.857 --> 01:09:15.424
Crazy bitches these days, huh.

01:09:15.426 --> 01:09:17.094
Yeah, Joey.

01:09:22.532 --> 01:09:24.099
Joey!

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.734
Hey, what's up, Ty.

01:09:26.736 --> 01:09:28.904
What are you doing here?

01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:31.308
I wanna fight.

01:09:33.444 --> 01:09:34.312
Sure.

01:09:37.747 --> 01:09:39.613
Alright guys, we

01:09:41.017 --> 01:09:42.283
Who wants to fight this
monster right here, huh?

01:09:42.285 --> 01:09:43.149
What do you got?

01:09:43.152 --> 01:09:44.385
Place your bets or go home.

01:09:44.386 --> 01:09:45.586
Joey, let me have him.

01:09:45.587 --> 01:09:46.956
I want to fight.

01:09:46.957 --> 01:09:47.756
You wanna
fight this guy, huh?

01:09:47.758 --> 01:09:48.756
Yeah, why not?

01:09:48.759 --> 01:09:49.823
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:09:49.826 --> 01:09:50.759
Alright, place your bets guys.

01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:51.693
What do you got on him?

01:09:51.694 --> 01:09:52.627
Bets guys, come on!

01:09:52.629 --> 01:09:53.426
We got a fight to start.

01:09:53.429 --> 01:09:54.229
We got a fight.

01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:55.096
What do you got?

01:09:55.098 --> 01:09:56.265
Come on.

01:09:56.267 --> 01:09:57.832
Alright, alright, we got
a fight tonight guys.

01:09:57.834 --> 01:09:59.467
Hey, let's keep it
real nasty tonight.

01:09:59.469 --> 01:10:00.435
Dirty.

01:10:00.437 --> 01:10:01.970
We fight till we drop.

01:10:01.972 --> 01:10:03.905
Nobody call the cops,
nobody calls an ambulance.

01:10:03.907 --> 01:10:05.774
Let's get this fight
going right, guys.

01:10:05.776 --> 01:10:07.175
Let's go, let's
see what you got!

01:10:07.177 --> 01:10:10.081
Let's see what you got, player.

01:10:11.281 --> 01:10:12.150
Come on.

01:10:13.717 --> 01:10:15.117
Get in, get in.

01:10:15.119 --> 01:10:17.155
Who wants to get paid?

01:10:18.789 --> 01:10:19.653
Ooh!

01:10:19.655 --> 01:10:21.023
Get up,

01:10:21.025 --> 01:10:22.090
- get up.
- It's alright, it's alright.

01:10:22.092 --> 01:10:24.195
Get back in it, get back in it.

01:10:27.365 --> 01:10:29.965
Come on, that
don't hurt, that don't hurt.

01:10:42.679 --> 01:10:45.282
There you go, whiz ball, baby.

01:10:56.793 --> 01:10:57.926
Come on, man.

01:10:57.928 --> 01:10:58.792
You wanna go home?

01:10:58.794 --> 01:11:00.197
You wanna quit?

01:11:04.834 --> 01:11:06.103
Come on, man.

01:11:11.607 --> 01:11:13.006
That hurt, huh?

01:11:13.008 --> 01:11:13.876
What you got, man?

01:11:13.878 --> 01:11:15.743
What you got?

01:11:21.884 --> 01:11:22.954
Stay down!

01:11:24.187 --> 01:11:24.853
Come on!

01:11:25.923 --> 01:11:28.689
Get my cash in here.

01:11:28.691 --> 01:11:31.361
I wanna see your fight.

01:12:08.798 --> 01:12:09.765
Okay, that's enough man.

01:12:09.767 --> 01:12:12.100
That's enough, hey!

01:12:12.102 --> 01:12:13.167
That's enough, man.

01:12:13.169 --> 01:12:14.903
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:12:14.905 --> 01:12:16.770
What are you fucking thinking?

01:12:16.772 --> 01:12:17.975
Take a rest.

01:12:19.677 --> 01:12:20.545
Hey.

01:12:26.549 --> 01:12:27.418
Ty!

01:12:47.103 --> 01:12:48.903
He alright?

01:12:48.905 --> 01:12:50.508
Still breathing.

01:12:54.710 --> 01:12:56.877
Alright, so you got my money?

01:12:56.879 --> 01:13:01.451
You nearly kill a man and
now you care about his money?

01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.022
It's all there.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:13.197
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:17.535
This is it?

01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:19.434
What do you mean?

01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:20.234
This is it.

01:13:20.236 --> 01:13:22.403
Everybody saw the video.

01:13:22.405 --> 01:13:26.041
Everybody knew
you was gonna win.

01:13:26.043 --> 01:13:28.342
We're you talking about me?

01:13:28.344 --> 01:13:30.615
You're a celebrity now!

01:13:31.947 --> 01:13:33.848
Enjoy that shit.

01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:34.986
Good fight.

01:13:57.973 --> 01:13:59.239
Ty?

01:13:59.241 --> 01:14:00.574
Ty, I never back heard from you.

01:14:00.576 --> 01:14:02.211
All you said that
you will call me.

01:14:02.213 --> 01:14:03.679
Yeah, I've been busy, okay?

01:14:03.681 --> 01:14:07.815
Yeah, well I'll have
this just one question.

01:14:07.817 --> 01:14:11.821
I was really good friends
with Victoria Mata.

01:14:13.022 --> 01:14:17.460
And I was wondering if you
knew what happened to her.

01:14:19.728 --> 01:14:23.431
I don't know what
happened to Victoria.

01:14:23.433 --> 01:14:26.436
Alright, I'm sorry
for your loss.

01:14:41.918 --> 01:14:44.021
Get him out of here.

01:14:49.826 --> 01:14:50.792
Yo, my man.

01:14:50.794 --> 01:14:52.196
Can I help you?

01:14:53.396 --> 01:14:55.729
Yeah, I wanna buy a ring.

01:14:55.731 --> 01:14:56.765
Now, do I know you?

01:14:56.767 --> 01:14:58.265
You look really familiar.

01:14:58.267 --> 01:15:01.168
Nah, you don't know me.

01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:03.671
Hey, well, I'm sorry but,

01:15:03.673 --> 01:15:07.442
I gotta ask you to take
your business elsewhere.

01:15:07.444 --> 01:15:08.810
Why?

01:15:08.812 --> 01:15:11.113
I just gotta ask you to leave.

01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:13.415
I told you I'm
tryna buy a ring.

01:15:14.151 --> 01:15:15.449
No man, wait a minute.

01:15:15.451 --> 01:15:17.185
That's why you look familiar.

01:15:17.187 --> 01:15:19.020
You're the dude from
the fight video.

01:15:19.022 --> 01:15:20.988
Yeah, yeah that's me.

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:22.290
And I'm fighting him again

01:15:22.292 --> 01:15:23.690
but this time it's
gonna be on TV.

01:15:23.692 --> 01:15:24.525
Yeah, man.

01:15:24.527 --> 01:15:26.127
Hey, I'm rooting for you.

01:15:26.129 --> 01:15:28.329
Oh sir, we have an
excellent selection

01:15:28.331 --> 01:15:30.398
of gold chains over here.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.100
I don't want a gold chain.

01:15:32.102 --> 01:15:33.635
Okay.

01:15:33.637 --> 01:15:35.603
I wanna buy my girlfriend
an engagement ring.

01:15:35.605 --> 01:15:37.639
Oh, of course.

01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:39.076
Right this way.

01:15:41.343 --> 01:15:42.943
We just got these in.

01:15:42.945 --> 01:15:44.681
Like to take a look?

01:15:50.253 --> 01:15:51.418
I want that one.

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:53.020
It's a beautiful choice.

01:15:53.022 --> 01:15:55.493
It is a very expensive ring.

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:02.499
Okay.

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:05.636
I'll wrap it up for you.

01:16:24.487 --> 01:16:26.557
Where are you going?

01:16:28.359 --> 01:16:31.161
Jesus Christ, you scared me.

01:16:32.495 --> 01:16:35.099
I just need some time away.

01:16:36.133 --> 01:16:39.270
Gonna stay with my
mom for a while.

01:17:47.771 --> 01:17:50.808
You are not doing
this right now.

01:17:53.776 --> 01:17:54.744
Marry me.

01:17:58.248 --> 01:17:59.316
I can't.

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:01.819
I can't.

01:18:04.254 --> 01:18:05.890
Please marry me.

01:18:12.862 --> 01:18:17.400
I've waited almost my
whole life for this moment.

01:18:20.303 --> 01:18:22.639
But I can't even enjoy it.

01:18:27.477 --> 01:18:31.579
Out of all the times
in my life I needed you,

01:18:31.581 --> 01:18:33.750
you gonna leave me now?

01:18:36.652 --> 01:18:38.019
Whitney!

01:18:38.021 --> 01:18:39.287
No, Ty.

01:18:39.289 --> 01:18:40.555
Let me go!

01:18:40.557 --> 01:18:43.491
- Listen to me!
- I'm not fucking Marco.

01:18:43.493 --> 01:18:45.529
Don't you ever touch me!

01:18:49.165 --> 01:18:51.267
That look in your eyes.

01:18:54.003 --> 01:18:55.539
You did kill her.

01:20:20.757 --> 01:20:23.357
Turn the back
foot all the way.

01:20:23.359 --> 01:20:24.692
All the way.

01:20:24.694 --> 01:20:26.694
'Cause really the whole
body working, right?

01:20:26.696 --> 01:20:27.528
Show me.

01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:28.796
Alright, okay.

01:20:28.798 --> 01:20:30.931
- I got you.
- Hey, what's up man?

01:20:30.933 --> 01:20:32.234
I really wished you
would've check on me

01:20:32.236 --> 01:20:34.402
before you posted that video.

01:20:34.404 --> 01:20:36.438
I'm sorry, dude.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.140
Look, everything's
not a game, Jameson.

01:20:40.142 --> 01:20:43.211
I wasn't tryna make it a game.

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:44.578
You know, you're right.

01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:48.116
I should've asked your
permission first, right?

01:20:48.118 --> 01:20:49.350
You know, I gotta
take a piss right now.

01:20:49.352 --> 01:20:50.318
You good with that?

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.089
Hey, don't do that.

01:20:56.692 --> 01:21:01.065
You're my boy, I'm just
trying to look out for you, bro.

01:21:05.936 --> 01:21:06.969
Nice watch.

01:21:08.538 --> 01:21:09.938
I gotta thank
you for that too.

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.273
Put some money in
the Marco fight.

01:21:12.275 --> 01:21:13.841
They offer well.

01:21:13.843 --> 01:21:14.677
Nice.

01:21:18.581 --> 01:21:20.314
Where's Pete.

01:21:20.316 --> 01:21:21.785
In the office.

01:21:22.819 --> 01:21:26.052
Tryna get some work in late?

01:21:26.054 --> 01:21:27.023
Yeah, man.

01:21:52.315 --> 01:21:56.853
I know a great way you can
take care some of those bills.

01:21:59.889 --> 01:22:01.389
Oh yeah?

01:22:01.391 --> 01:22:02.459
Yeah.

01:22:04.727 --> 01:22:07.996
I know a fighter who's
looking for a manager.

01:22:07.998 --> 01:22:10.363
Heard he's got a big
payday coming too.

01:22:10.365 --> 01:22:12.065
Is that right?

01:22:12.067 --> 01:22:12.936
Yeah.

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.877
Fight's comin' up soon.

01:22:37.526 --> 01:22:40.630
I know you didn't
kill that girl.

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.866
I'm sorry for even asking.

01:22:50.205 --> 01:22:51.775
Whitney's gone.

01:22:53.543 --> 01:22:56.112
This fight's all I have left.

01:23:00.284 --> 01:23:02.785
Well, let's get to it then.

01:23:03.953 --> 01:23:07.891
We got a lot of work to do and
not a lot of time to do it.

01:23:14.329 --> 01:23:15.465
Yes, sir.

01:25:23.959 --> 01:25:26.961
Marco
Undefeatable Reign.

01:25:26.963 --> 01:25:28.931
Ty The Tiger Matthews.

01:25:29.932 --> 01:25:32.936
The fighter whose
video went viral.

01:25:33.736 --> 01:25:35.905
In an unknown location.

01:25:37.641 --> 01:25:40.574
The battle the
internet demanded.

01:25:40.576 --> 01:25:41.645
No crowds.

01:25:42.579 --> 01:25:43.647
No rules.

01:25:44.312 --> 01:25:45.348
No nonsense.

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:49.084
This time, it's official.

01:25:49.852 --> 01:25:52.655
Exclusively tonight at 10 p.m.

01:25:58.494 --> 01:26:01.231
Can you lose the glasses, sir?

01:26:05.768 --> 01:26:08.970
So take me through
what happened.

01:26:08.972 --> 01:26:10.840
I have witnesses.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:14.876
Why would he do this to you?

01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:18.181
He was angry over
some fight on TV.

01:26:19.615 --> 01:26:22.051
He was upset that Marco won.

01:26:23.185 --> 01:26:26.186
How was I suppose to know
the guy was a fighter?

01:26:26.188 --> 01:26:28.221
What do you say to him?

01:26:28.223 --> 01:26:29.092
Nothing.

01:26:30.026 --> 01:26:33.461
He was upset I was
rooting for Marco

01:26:33.463 --> 01:26:36.029
and he savagely attacked me.

01:26:36.031 --> 01:26:38.565
The man is a danger to society.

01:26:38.567 --> 01:26:41.802
You guys need to do something.

01:26:41.804 --> 01:26:44.037
Were you hitting on him?

01:26:44.039 --> 01:26:45.172
Hitting on him?

01:26:45.174 --> 01:26:46.674
No.

01:26:46.676 --> 01:26:47.640
No.

01:26:47.642 --> 01:26:49.042
We're at a strip club.

01:26:49.044 --> 01:26:51.244
I was hitting on a woman.

01:26:51.246 --> 01:26:51.979
Okay.

01:26:51.981 --> 01:26:52.846
I thought you.

01:26:52.848 --> 01:26:53.948
Uh-huh.

01:26:53.950 --> 01:26:55.349
That's ridiculous.

01:26:55.351 --> 01:26:58.088
Okay, we'll be back
in just a second.

01:27:05.061 --> 01:27:07.431
There's no smoking here.

01:27:11.734 --> 01:27:16.072
Either he's a bullshit artist
or Matthews' attacked him.

01:27:17.272 --> 01:27:18.307
Kick him up.

01:27:19.642 --> 01:27:20.541
Take his name.

01:27:20.543 --> 01:27:21.643
Do you guys see

01:27:21.645 --> 01:27:23.914
- what he did to my face?
- Yes.

01:27:25.182 --> 01:27:26.213
- Alright.
- Would be known

01:27:26.215 --> 01:27:27.614
I'd like to press charges.

01:27:27.616 --> 01:27:29.683
I was thinking of that
would be the next thing

01:27:29.685 --> 01:27:31.254
outta your mouth.

01:27:32.454 --> 01:27:34.787
To the fullest extent.

01:27:34.789 --> 01:27:36.258
Fill this out.

01:27:37.526 --> 01:27:39.193
I'm sorry, can you
help me fill it out?

01:27:39.195 --> 01:27:42.732
I have a splint on
my hand right here.

01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:48.469
What's your name?

01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:49.940
Boomer Craveli.

01:27:52.174 --> 01:27:53.674
Two Os.

01:27:53.676 --> 01:27:54.878
Seriously?

01:30:27.730 --> 01:30:29.232
Come on, babe.

01:30:46.615 --> 01:30:47.681
Center up.

01:30:47.683 --> 01:30:49.449
To
millions have joined us.

01:30:49.451 --> 01:30:53.489
Tonight, you're watching
these two go head to head.

01:30:56.092 --> 01:30:57.725
Alright gentlemen,
obey all the rules,

01:30:57.727 --> 01:31:00.327
protect yourself at all
times, follow my instructions.

01:31:00.329 --> 01:31:01.761
Let's have a clean fight.

01:31:01.763 --> 01:31:04.064
Touch gloves and let's do this.

01:31:04.066 --> 01:31:06.132
Come on, Ty!

01:31:06.134 --> 01:31:08.170
Hey, baby.

01:31:10.873 --> 01:31:11.738
You got him, Ty.

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:13.042
Come on, baby.

01:31:19.315 --> 01:31:20.948
You ready to fight?

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:21.881
Are you ready?

01:31:21.883 --> 01:31:22.718
Do it!

01:31:24.253 --> 01:31:26.653
Come on, baby.

01:31:26.655 --> 01:31:27.657
Come on, Ty.

01:31:31.561 --> 01:31:32.429
Watch out!

01:31:36.865 --> 01:31:38.200
Come on, baby.

01:31:42.804 --> 01:31:44.240
Get up, get up.

01:31:51.246 --> 01:31:54.249
Get him off you,
get him off you!

01:32:00.889 --> 01:32:01.854
Come on baby!

01:32:01.856 --> 01:32:03.592
You got it, let's go!

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:19.707
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:20.573
Get him, baby!

01:32:20.575 --> 01:32:21.444
Come on!

01:32:53.241 --> 01:32:55.110
Hold him, hold him!

01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.516
Come on, Ty!

01:33:02.718 --> 01:33:04.053
Come on, baby!

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:09.055
That's it, Marco!

01:33:29.544 --> 01:33:31.177
Back to your corner.

01:33:31.179 --> 01:33:32.246
To your corner!

01:33:44.192 --> 01:33:45.695
Come on, babe.

01:34:21.730 --> 01:34:22.732
Get him, Ty!

01:34:29.271 --> 01:34:30.503
Hang onto his feet!

01:34:30.505 --> 01:34:32.275
Nice feet, Marco!

01:34:46.021 --> 01:34:48.491
Come on, Marco!

01:34:57.499 --> 01:34:59.833
Hold
him, hold him tight.

01:34:59.835 --> 01:35:00.904
Get on him!

01:35:04.405 --> 01:35:06.172
Ty, that's it, yes!

01:35:06.174 --> 01:35:07.274
Yeah!

01:35:07.276 --> 01:35:08.842
Come on, boy, go!

01:35:08.844 --> 01:35:11.177
He's going
for the rear naked choke!

01:35:11.179 --> 01:35:13.749
Get him, hold it!

01:35:17.919 --> 01:35:18.788
Yeah.

01:35:29.432 --> 01:35:30.463
Hold him, Ty!

01:35:30.465 --> 01:35:32.634
Hold him, Ty, you got him!

01:35:38.173 --> 01:35:39.073
Yes!

01:35:39.075 --> 01:35:40.239
Yes!

01:35:40.241 --> 01:35:41.311
Yes!

01:35:42.143 --> 01:35:43.743
Ty!

01:35:45.379 --> 01:35:46.548
Yes!

01:35:47.984 --> 01:35:49.582
I can't
believe my eyes!

01:35:49.584 --> 01:35:52.252
Ty Matthews has choked
out the champion!

01:35:52.254 --> 01:35:54.290
The champion is down!

01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:40.533
Ty Matthews,
you're under arrest

01:36:40.535 --> 01:36:43.502
for the assault
on Boomer Carveli.

01:36:43.504 --> 01:36:44.904
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:36:44.906 --> 01:36:46.974
Anything you say can and
will be held against you

01:36:46.976 --> 01:36:48.074
in the court of law.

01:36:48.076 --> 01:36:49.676
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:36:49.678 --> 01:36:50.777
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

01:36:50.779 --> 01:36:51.744
one will be provided to you by...

01:36:51.746 --> 01:36:53.313
What are you doing?

01:36:53.315 --> 01:36:54.381
Back up.

01:36:54.383 --> 01:36:55.783
What's this all about?

01:36:55.785 --> 01:36:57.150
You'll be arrested for
obstruction of justice.

01:37:00.856 --> 01:37:04.424
Do you understand them rights
that I just sentenced to you?

01:37:04.426 --> 01:37:05.492
- Ty?
- You have the right if might

01:37:05.494 --> 01:37:08.331
you wish to waive these rights.

01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:20.410
Ty?

01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:22.876
Ty, what's happening?

01:37:22.878 --> 01:37:24.277
What did he do?

01:37:24.279 --> 01:37:25.647
What did he do?

01:37:29.517 --> 01:37:31.685
What the hell happened?

01:37:31.687 --> 01:37:33.286
This man at a bar.

01:37:33.288 --> 01:37:36.290
He started a fight with me.

01:37:36.292 --> 01:37:39.091
You're gotta be kidding me.

01:37:39.093 --> 01:37:40.661
With everything that's
going on right now,

01:37:40.663 --> 01:37:44.096
you couldn't just ignore
some asshole at a bar?

01:37:44.098 --> 01:37:45.899
I know, baby.

01:37:45.901 --> 01:37:47.434
You're right.

01:37:47.436 --> 01:37:50.673
There's always
an excuse with you.

01:37:51.807 --> 01:37:55.944
Always some reason why the
whole world is against you.

01:37:57.111 --> 01:38:00.882
This time, you really
did it to yourself.

01:38:04.453 --> 01:38:06.989
Got the money for your fight.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:10.493
It's all going to the lawyer.

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:15.528
Who you gonna blame for that?

01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:16.598
Whitney.

01:38:18.333 --> 01:38:19.835
I love you, baby.

01:38:27.042 --> 01:38:28.511
I love you too.

01:38:31.413 --> 01:38:34.314
It's just not enough, sometimes.

01:38:34.316 --> 01:38:35.451
I gotta go.

01:38:39.021 --> 01:38:42.021
I'll try to come
and visit you soon.

01:38:42.023 --> 01:38:45.628
I just need some time
to clear my head.

01:39:09.451 --> 01:39:12.385
You're a trained killer
who brutally assaulted a man

01:39:12.387 --> 01:39:13.722
outside a bar.

01:39:14.856 --> 01:39:17.090
And now you're going
to jail for it.

01:39:17.092 --> 01:39:20.092
And while you're
doing time for that,

01:39:20.094 --> 01:39:23.499
I'm gonna get you
for Victoria Mata.

01:39:28.036 --> 01:39:30.839
You have a visitor.

01:39:54.062 --> 01:39:57.532
You're making
yourself comfortable.

01:39:58.366 --> 01:39:59.966
What are you doing here?

01:39:59.968 --> 01:40:04.206
I came here to see the
fighter that turned me down.

01:40:05.039 --> 01:40:07.976
You should've
honored our contract.

01:40:09.145 --> 01:40:11.845
But like I said before,
if you're not on our team,

01:40:11.847 --> 01:40:13.846
you're against us.

01:40:13.848 --> 01:40:16.716
But I wanna thank you for
a great show.

01:40:16.718 --> 01:40:19.121
You're a hell of a fighter.

01:40:20.155 --> 01:40:21.521
I won that fight.

01:40:21.523 --> 01:40:26.061
Yeah, I know you won the
fight and lost the war.

01:40:28.330 --> 01:40:31.264
Hey, if you wanna be a winner,

01:40:31.266 --> 01:40:35.204
you gotta know the game,
your plan and the rules.

01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:38.070
Like your buddy.

01:40:38.072 --> 01:40:38.975
Jameson?

01:40:40.476 --> 01:40:42.809
Ah, he's a winner.

01:40:42.811 --> 01:40:44.847
And young and strong.

01:40:46.481 --> 01:40:48.117
He knows the game.

01:40:59.828 --> 01:41:03.699
Oh, he would do anything
the be a champion.

01:41:07.835 --> 01:41:08.902
You know, there's a lot of money

01:41:08.904 --> 01:41:10.470
to be made in this business.

01:41:10.472 --> 01:41:14.310
And I make my money by
any means necessary.

01:41:34.362 --> 01:41:38.131
You killed her, didn't
you, you motherfucker.

01:41:38.133 --> 01:41:42.605
Some have a shelf life
just longer than others.

01:42:12.734 --> 01:42:14.203
Like I told you.

01:42:16.304 --> 01:42:17.503
Don't fuck with things

01:42:17.505 --> 01:42:20.676
that are way beyond
your comprehension.

01:42:21.942 --> 01:42:23.676
I'm gonna get outta here.

01:42:25.114 --> 01:42:28.150
And when I do, I'm
gonna kill you.

01:42:30.119 --> 01:42:32.752
I don't think
you're taking this in.

01:42:32.754 --> 01:42:35.555
See, this is your home now.

01:42:35.557 --> 01:42:36.924
This cage is the only place

01:42:36.926 --> 01:42:40.096
you're gonna be
fighting for a while.

01:42:41.996 --> 01:42:43.895
Why'd you do this to me?

01:42:43.897 --> 01:42:45.634
I hate to lose.

01:42:46.735 --> 01:42:48.771
I take it personally.

01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:54.776
You take care, champ.

01:43:14.596 --> 01:43:17.898
We have here this
evening, Marco Reign.

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:19.498
Of course, I'm still champ.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:21.001
That punk got lucky.

01:43:21.003 --> 01:43:24.070
I'll fight that guy
again anytime, any place.

01:43:24.072 --> 01:43:26.275
That's including prison.

01:44:08.084 --> 01:44:09.783
What happened
to your ear?

01:44:09.785 --> 01:44:13.185
Man, I was getting down
with this chick, right.

01:44:13.187 --> 01:44:15.421
She's hot too she used
to being grab my ear

01:44:15.423 --> 01:44:16.924
and scratch my shit.

01:44:16.926 --> 01:44:18.125
I really wished
you would've check on me

01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:20.862
before you posted that video.

01:44:21.829 --> 01:44:23.229
You're my boy,

01:44:23.231 --> 01:44:24.564
I'm just trying to
look out for you, bro.

01:44:24.566 --> 01:44:26.202
Nice watch.

01:44:29.303 --> 01:44:30.936
I gotta thank
you for that too.

01:44:30.938 --> 01:44:32.971
Put some money in
the Marco fight.

01:44:32.973 --> 01:44:34.841
They offer well.
