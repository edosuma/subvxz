00:01.401 --> 00:02.902
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:02.969 --> 00:05.905
<i>I'm not mad, I'm hurt.
I'm on this rollercoaster ride with you.</i>

00:05.972 --> 00:08.441
So, when you decide to jump off,
I feel the scrapes, too.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.010
I would like to formally welcome

00:11.077 --> 00:13.947
"Great Day USA's"
newest correspondent, Dani Hollins.

00:15.515 --> 00:16.549
<i>There was a guy.</i>

00:16.616 --> 00:18.818
<i>He only wanted help
getting his art out there.</i>

00:18.885 --> 00:20.687
You came to New York
to find a sugar daddy

00:20.754 --> 00:22.655
to solve your problems
and take care of you?

00:22.722 --> 00:24.791
Maybe it's time
to get real with yourself

00:24.858 --> 00:26.993
and find what makes you wanna get up.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.995
You two are involved, romantically.

00:29.062 --> 00:31.264
I'm taking you off her stories.
And there's more.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.333
Justin, I'm sending you to Kansas.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.883
Stay focused. Here we go.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.388
Let's see what's what.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.741
Amsterdam. Istanbul.

01:48.808 --> 01:49.943
Berlin.

01:50.009 --> 01:51.311
A typical producer.

01:51.878 --> 01:54.047
Kabul? Who'd you go to Kabul with?

02:05.525 --> 02:07.393
That's what I thought.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.628
Okay.

02:17.303 --> 02:18.838
One little look around won't hurt.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.444
Sorry not sorry, girl.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.353
You know that's right.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.669
Well...

02:49.736 --> 02:53.139
you can't fault a brother
for being prepared for the Apocalypse.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.109
Dork. Okay.

04:03.509 --> 04:04.844
Good morning.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.346
Hey, morning.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.686
What's got you going this early
and dressed up to boot?

04:13.753 --> 04:15.855
You know that old saying...

04:15.922 --> 04:17.724
the early bird gets the worm.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.627
Nobody's gonna help me be successful,

04:20.693 --> 04:22.695
so, I've gotta go get it.

04:23.529 --> 04:24.731
Is this about some guy?

04:24.797 --> 04:26.299
No, it's not about some guy.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.234
A job?

04:28.835 --> 04:31.037
Not just a job, a career.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.474
And what sparked this new attitude?

04:34.540 --> 04:36.676
I don't know. I guess...

04:36.743 --> 04:38.978
seeing New York,
spending time with Auntie.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.414
It just gave me a whole new perspective.

04:41.914 --> 04:43.416
I'm stepping into my destiny.

04:45.251 --> 04:48.821
Well, when you get to destiny,
pick up more half and half, this is bad.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.259
Hey, girl, guess what?

04:53.326 --> 04:56.129
That bullied cub scout that fought back,
I told his parents

04:56.195 --> 04:58.064
that he deserves to tell his story.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.267
We've got a full-fledged
social commentary on our hands now.

05:01.334 --> 05:02.535
Yes, mama!

05:04.303 --> 05:05.405
Okay.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.274
I mean, I'm all about more eyes on me,
but why the sudden push?

05:08.341 --> 05:10.343
Since Ronda dispelled those nasty rumors,

05:10.410 --> 05:12.679
they wanna promote GDU
as one big, happy family.

05:12.745 --> 05:14.681
I mean, we all can be related,

05:14.747 --> 05:15.982
except for Mary Jane.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.184
She could be our adopted
sister from Malawi.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.786
Your social media will blow up that.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.460
A closed-door conversation.
Am I being let go?

05:27.527 --> 05:29.262
No. No.

05:29.328 --> 05:32.231
- Then what did you want to talk about?
- Snooping.

05:32.298 --> 05:33.599
How far is too far?

05:34.734 --> 05:37.870
Lord. What did you do?

05:37.937 --> 05:41.340
I may have taken a box of keepsakes
from Justin's apartment.

05:41.407 --> 05:43.710
You didn't start
with misdemeanor snooping,

05:43.776 --> 05:45.311
you went to grand larceny.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.681
I only looked at, like, an eighth of it.

05:49.949 --> 05:51.117
Perhaps a third.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.486
- Perhaps.
- And what did you find?

05:53.553 --> 05:56.055
Okay, so, he dated this girl
named Simone for years,

05:56.122 --> 05:58.424
and he saved all
of the birthday cards she sent him.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.093
I didn't peg him as a romantic.

06:00.159 --> 06:03.629
I know, but he also may have
slept with his therapist.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.632
There was a letter. It was cryptic.
I'm not supposed to know this.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.869
You took a man's private belongings
and now you feel guilty.

06:09.936 --> 06:13.039
We have been together for weeks,
and I still feel like I don't know him.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.908
Put the box back and talk to him.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.177
- I will.
- When?

06:18.244 --> 06:20.379
- After you've looked everything?
- Basically.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.681
Immediately.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.418
And by the way, Mary Jane,
if you don't book my bartender Lorenzo,

06:25.485 --> 06:27.787
he won't be available
for your house warming.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.124
Right. Yeah. I can't do that party.

06:31.190 --> 06:32.291
Why not?

06:32.358 --> 06:35.561
You know how GDU is trying to sell
the whole one big happy family thing?

06:35.628 --> 06:38.164
And I thought, great,
I can invite my friends from work.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.767
Except now Justin's gone
and Kara's not talking to me,

06:40.833 --> 06:43.803
and my brother, PJ,
is trapped in Dubai somewhere.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.671
I have no buffers. I can't do it.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.840
It's a work party now. You can't cancel.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.275
Suck it up, girl.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.511
And it won't kill you
to plaster on that fake smile

06:51.577 --> 06:53.913
and play hostess for one night.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.084
- You do it every day at GDU.
- I sure do.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.154
- Watch me work.
- Right, then.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.997
I never expected to see you
back here, Niecy.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.298
I know, Claudia.

07:13.399 --> 07:14.867
I was wondering if we could talk.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.711
I don't have much time.

07:25.778 --> 07:29.282
That's okay.
Look, I just came here to apologize.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.918
I screwed up, major bad.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.953
Our agreement
was that you give me a booth

07:34.020 --> 07:35.788
while I go to school for my license.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.523
Not everybody gets that deal.

07:37.590 --> 07:38.991
I realize that now.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.561
And I never should have dropped out.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.895
You have the talent,

07:42.962 --> 07:44.831
so, I thought
I could take a chance on you.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.465
Well, since you feel that way,

07:46.532 --> 07:49.035
I was hoping
that you would give me my job back.

07:49.101 --> 07:52.305
Look, I even paid to enroll in classes.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.006
I've got the receipt right here.

07:54.073 --> 07:57.443
Honestly, Niecy, I don't feel comfortable
taking another chance.

07:57.510 --> 07:58.678
I can't afford to.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.315
Look...

08:03.216 --> 08:05.051
this is important to me.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.953
When something is truly important,

08:07.019 --> 08:09.755
we do the work and we don't make excuses.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.457
It's not an excuse.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.761
You were a single mother.
You know how hard it is.

08:15.828 --> 08:17.496
Yes, I do,

08:17.563 --> 08:20.566
and I still found a way
to be a mom and go to school.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.768
If this is what you want
for you and your kids,

08:22.835 --> 08:24.871
you'll find a way to do both...

08:24.937 --> 08:26.105
at some other salon.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.507
Now, if you will excuse me,

08:28.574 --> 08:30.509
I have to get ready for my first client.

08:36.382 --> 08:38.451
Protest is telling the truth in public,

08:38.517 --> 08:41.787
that we use our bodies and our voices
to tell the truth in the street.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.624
Be mindful that we aren't born woke.
Something wakes us up.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.927
It's important to remember
that activism, that protest,

08:47.994 --> 08:49.195
is not only in the street.

08:49.262 --> 08:52.231
It's not only retweeting a hashtag
or wearing a t-shirt,

08:52.298 --> 08:53.799
or standing outside,

08:53.866 --> 08:55.835
but a movement is many things.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.503
- And as we move forward...
- Faggot.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.840
As we... move forward,

09:01.440 --> 09:04.243
it's important to remember
that we take the truth everywhere,

09:04.310 --> 09:06.913
to the dinner table,
in our schools, in our churches...

09:06.979 --> 09:09.015
Nah, what we need is a real leader.

09:09.081 --> 09:10.516
Yeah.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.586
Thank you, Patrick Patterson,
for the invitation.

09:18.190 --> 09:21.460
DeRay Mckesson, a powerful voice
from the Black Lives Matter movement,

09:21.527 --> 09:25.164
coming here from Baltimore to mobilize,
motivate us and help us speak our truth.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.133
Let's all show him some more gratitude.

09:36.175 --> 09:39.512
Tying that workout story
to chronic back pain...

09:39.578 --> 09:40.980
that was fresh.

09:41.547 --> 09:42.949
It was Justin's idea, wasn't it?

09:44.483 --> 09:47.687
I suppose that's why
he's a senior producer, the fresh ideas.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.389
I thought he got the job
'cause Ronda wanted another black.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.892
I think they knew each other.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.293
But you know...

09:55.061 --> 09:57.196
Justin's a smart producer.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.265
Yeah. Isn't his mother white?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.834
I don't... know.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.503
Excuse me, Dani?

10:04.570 --> 10:07.373
I'm sure that a woman
with your elite background

10:07.440 --> 10:10.176
doesn't mean to suggest
that Justin's intelligence

10:10.242 --> 10:13.145
is attributable to his mother
being Caucasian, right?

10:13.212 --> 10:16.182
Because that comment
would be incendiary,

10:16.248 --> 10:17.516
and flat-out racist.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.720
No, that's not what I meant at all.
I was referring to his blue eyes.

10:20.786 --> 10:23.522
You know, for once,
I really wish that I could make

10:23.589 --> 10:25.358
an observation about a person of color

10:25.424 --> 10:26.926
and it not be labeled as racist.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.227
Bullshit!

10:28.294 --> 10:29.862
Yeah, I'm gonna call it.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.630
I'm gonna go ahead and call bullshit!

10:31.697 --> 10:35.334
And not that his racial background
is any of your concern,

10:35.401 --> 10:37.937
but both
of Justin Talbot's parents are black.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.673
So, contrary to what your narrow mind
might believe,

10:40.740 --> 10:43.309
white people do not have
a monopoly on unique eye color

10:43.376 --> 10:45.111
any more than they do on intelligence,

10:45.177 --> 10:48.247
which is a fact that you drive home
on a regular basis.

10:48.314 --> 10:52.218
So, the next time you get the urge
to exercise "free speech,"

10:52.284 --> 10:54.587
by unclogging
that verbal diarrhea factory

10:54.653 --> 10:57.189
you call a mouth and spewing
your partisan bullshit

10:57.256 --> 10:59.091
all over this studio,

10:59.158 --> 11:02.028
do us all a favor and shut the hell up,

11:02.094 --> 11:04.764
you ill-mannered, over-privileged,

11:04.830 --> 11:07.066
under-educated simpleton!

11:07.133 --> 11:08.434
Shut up!

11:33.325 --> 11:36.295
The fall-out from this mess
is going to cost us viewers,

11:36.362 --> 11:39.131
which means lower ratings,
which means lower revenue.

11:39.198 --> 11:42.735
So, when I get upstairs,
we need to talk to Legal.

11:48.707 --> 11:49.875
How bad is it?

11:49.942 --> 11:52.545
Girl, first tell me... are you okay?

11:52.611 --> 11:55.414
No. No. You know, I never thought
I would actually miss

11:55.481 --> 11:58.184
the days when racism
was administered covertly,

11:58.250 --> 12:01.454
you know,
'cause this president, he has...

12:01.520 --> 12:03.989
he has encouraged
the dim-witted radicals

12:04.056 --> 12:06.625
to just walk on over
and start shit with me.

12:06.692 --> 12:09.995
And you know what really sucks
is when you're branded unreasonable,

12:10.062 --> 12:13.532
or "the angry black woman,"
or, "gosh, she's so overly sensitive,"

12:13.599 --> 12:16.836
when you are actually offended
when someone is spouting off

12:16.902 --> 12:18.471
with their racist opinions.

12:18.537 --> 12:22.241
But we live in a free country
where everyone is able to just...

12:22.308 --> 12:24.376
speak their truth, right?

12:25.511 --> 12:27.646
By all accounts, you are correct.

12:27.713 --> 12:32.284
And Justin and I just had
a fricking win with Garrett

12:32.351 --> 12:34.186
with that last story and now...

12:35.821 --> 12:36.856
I go and do this.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.625
I'll go to Garrett's office
to assess right now.

12:40.359 --> 12:43.796
Girl, while I'm there,
regain your composure,

12:44.697 --> 12:48.100
then step out of here
like you're the anchor of this show.

12:51.537 --> 12:52.571
Thank you.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.843
- Great hearing you live.
- It's great to see you.

12:57.910 --> 13:01.046
I've heard so much about the work
you're doing in Atlanta, keep it up.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.283
I know there's a lot of work to do.
Black tutors have been talking you up.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.385
I don't know what that means,
but I thank you.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.255
Just trying to do my part.
Excuse me for a minute.

13:13.225 --> 13:14.760
What's your name, man?

13:15.394 --> 13:16.762
Jovan.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.532
It looked like you had an issue
with today's speech.

13:19.598 --> 13:23.035
- It's still a free country, right?
- If we are vigilant, it'll stay that way.

13:23.102 --> 13:25.337
There's a right and wrong way
to voice opposition.

13:25.404 --> 13:26.438
Nah, I get it.

13:26.505 --> 13:29.241
You think I'm just some thug
you can school about tactics.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.777
No, I'd actually like to hear
what you have to say.

13:31.844 --> 13:35.247
No, I would. How about we go grab
a bite to eat and we can talk about it?

13:35.848 --> 13:37.016
Get some real food.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.685
- You buying?
- Yeah, I'm buying.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.857
All right. What are we talking,
pizza or burgers?

13:44.924 --> 13:46.492
Whatever you prefer.

13:47.259 --> 13:51.397
Niecy, you're good at hair,
so just do hair.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.933
But I don't wanna do my friends' weaves

13:53.999 --> 13:55.701
in my grandmother's basement.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.637
A chair at a salon would make me legit,

13:59.138 --> 14:00.506
get me clientele.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.374
Well, doesn't your mother do hair?

14:02.441 --> 14:03.776
Why don't you just ask her?

14:03.842 --> 14:05.711
You know, I wanted to see

14:05.778 --> 14:08.047
how long it would take her to reach out

14:08.113 --> 14:09.882
if I stopped calling,

14:09.949 --> 14:11.317
just as an experiment.

14:11.383 --> 14:12.651
And how long has it been?

14:12.718 --> 14:14.153
Going on three months now.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.822
Damn. Sorry, girl.

14:17.856 --> 14:21.660
- Your mom's starting to act like mine.
- I know, it's just so frustrating

14:21.727 --> 14:22.928
'cause I need this job.

14:22.995 --> 14:26.265
Now Claudia's starting to look at me
like I'm some screw-up like my dad.

14:26.332 --> 14:29.235
- What? She said you were a screw-up?
- She didn't have to.

14:29.902 --> 14:32.071
She knows about my dad's drug trouble.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.407
Niecy, from where I'm sitting,

14:35.474 --> 14:36.909
you're not a screw-up.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.644
You've gotta get that out of your head.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.513
That's where it is, in your head.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.916
- I know.
- You sure?

14:44.783 --> 14:48.554
'Cause it seems like the only person
that thinks you're a screw-up is you.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.860
Wait. Wait a minute.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.495
What happened? What?

14:58.597 --> 15:01.400
Well, when are you gonna know more?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.505
I can't, honey. I'm at work right now.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.475
You can use my office,
if you need some privacy.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.244
Okay.

15:21.120 --> 15:25.024
Hey. So, I just left Garrett's office.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.926
- What do you wanna hear first?
- Let's start with the good news.

15:27.993 --> 15:30.529
Garrett and I are smoothing
things over with HR.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.697
Thank God.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.166
Okay... The bad?

15:34.233 --> 15:37.569
Garrett's most concerned
about a potential PR problem.

15:37.636 --> 15:40.572
We just got out of hot water
with the whole Ronda debacle,

15:40.639 --> 15:42.374
and an hour after shooting a spot

15:42.441 --> 15:45.711
promoting the GDU family,
you and a new colleague are going at it.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.514
But what happened
was within the GDU walls,

15:48.580 --> 15:51.517
- there's no pictures or video, so...
- People talk.

15:53.185 --> 15:54.987
That, they do.

15:55.954 --> 15:59.625
Okay, well, let's... Let's put our heads
together and strategize a solution.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.294
I already offered Garrett one
and he's down.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.962
Do I even wanna know?

16:04.029 --> 16:05.964
Your upcoming house warming party.

16:06.031 --> 16:08.133
Garrett wants me to get a photographer

16:08.200 --> 16:10.035
from "Entertainment Weekly" to be there

16:10.102 --> 16:12.504
to promote the GDU family thing.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.940
That means everyone
would be there, including Dani.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.844
Garrett will be in Silicon Valley
meeting with Zuckerberg for "Tech Week,"

16:18.911 --> 16:20.446
but everyone else, yes.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.748
It'll be a party full of people
that I don't like.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.084
And it's not like they'd come
after what happened.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.353
That brings me
to the second part of the deal.

16:27.419 --> 16:28.654
God, there's more.

16:28.721 --> 16:31.290
You're gonna have
to apologize, in public,

16:31.357 --> 16:33.058
to the entire crew.

16:34.426 --> 16:37.062
You need to convince everybody
you're genuinely sorry.

16:40.899 --> 16:44.103
- Who DeRay gets with is his business.
- Nah, he's in the front lines.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.538
He's making it my business.
How we gonna mobilize,

16:46.605 --> 16:48.741
like MLK when we got some homo
running the show?

16:48.807 --> 16:50.008
You really believe that?

16:50.075 --> 16:53.712
With the challenges facing Black people
today, the stakes are too high.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.547
If we wanna mobilize the masses,

16:55.614 --> 16:57.516
we can't afford
someone like that leading.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.619
Do you know the brainchild
behind the March on Washington?

17:00.686 --> 17:03.222
- Martin Luther King.
- Wrong, it was Bayard Rustin.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.358
Rustin was one
of Dr. King's closest advisors.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.760
He was also openly gay.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.831
If he was so open,
how come I never heard of him?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.234
Dr. King needed to keep that under wraps.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.469
But if Dr. King thought
like you and your boys,

17:17.536 --> 17:19.304
there wouldn't have even been a march.

17:19.371 --> 17:23.876
See, it'll be a great day when we can
convince everyone to support the cause,

17:23.942 --> 17:26.044
even if they don't agree
with their sexuality.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.013
But that day ain't here yet, so...

17:28.080 --> 17:30.549
you may not like it,
but that's how it is.

17:31.950 --> 17:35.721
Listen, we have an old saying in NA.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.656
- NA?
- Narcotics Anonymous.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.292
Take what you like, and leave the rest.

17:41.026 --> 17:42.161
What's that mean?

17:42.227 --> 17:45.030
There are tons of people involved
with "Black Lives Matter,"

17:45.097 --> 17:47.032
so many others you can identify with.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.301
If you don't like DeRay,
find someone else.

17:49.368 --> 17:52.171
You said it yourself,
there's important work to be done.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.406
So, you're gonna let DeRay
stop you from doing it?

17:55.441 --> 17:59.044
A white woman, like Dani, gets to say
whatever she wants and get away with it,

17:59.111 --> 18:01.113
but the black woman has to apologize?

18:01.180 --> 18:04.450
You're not just any black woman,
you're the co-anchor.

18:04.516 --> 18:07.553
You're a leader, so lead by example.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.656
And Dani makes off-color remarks,
but she's harmless.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.991
You are too young
to have encountered real racism.

18:13.058 --> 18:15.260
Once you've lived a little,
you'll know what I mean.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.930
Please. I grew up
on the South Side of Chicago,

18:17.996 --> 18:21.934
and moved to Boston, which is
like traveling back in time to 1842.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.469
I know racism.

18:23.535 --> 18:26.038
But I have a trick
to help me bite my tongue.

18:26.104 --> 18:27.306
I don't need any tricks.

18:27.372 --> 18:30.909
Really? You could have gotten fired
for that clap-back at Dani.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.846
If you don't figure out a way
to be civil to this woman,

18:33.912 --> 18:36.448
it's your image that suffers, not hers.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.051
Point taken.

18:40.085 --> 18:41.386
What are your tricks?

18:41.453 --> 18:44.957
You know how when someone
is dealing with stage fright,

18:45.023 --> 18:47.059
they imagine everybody naked?

18:48.060 --> 18:49.828
That's how I deal with racism.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.431
You imagine racists in their panties.

18:52.498 --> 18:55.834
No. I treat racism
as a disease of the mind.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.537
When you feel a rant coming on,

18:58.604 --> 19:01.039
imagine they're a bag lady on 5th Avenue

19:01.106 --> 19:02.608
spewing all the crazy.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.409
Ignore it and move on.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.381
I might be able to learn
something from you.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.350
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

19:11.416 --> 19:13.785
Take what you just learned
and apply it to the apology

19:13.852 --> 19:16.255
you're gonna give to everybody
before tomorrow's show.

19:18.156 --> 19:19.324
Geez.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.427
God, what now?

19:22.494 --> 19:24.530
It's not work related.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.498
I'm going to see
Chance the Rapper tonight.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.301
Wow, I didn't even know
he was performing.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.771
Yeah, a secret show in Brooklyn.
He dropped a hint about it on Whatsagwan.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.574
- You're taking your man.
- Nah, just some friends.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.142
Okay.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.444
Well, you know, I've...

19:39.511 --> 19:42.381
I have never seen him live.

19:42.447 --> 19:43.949
That would be amazing.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.817
Girl, you have no idea.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.290
Well, you know, go. Have a good time.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.759
Thanks. You know what?

19:53.825 --> 19:57.296
If you need help with the apology,
just give me a call, okay?

20:04.436 --> 20:06.204
You still haven't returned his things?

20:06.271 --> 20:07.606
It took me hours

20:07.673 --> 20:10.442
to put back everything
the way I found it.

20:10.509 --> 20:14.012
I had to match everything, exactly.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.181
I was not taking no chances. Look.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.450
You took photos of the content.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.118
Look, this ain't my first rodeo.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.219
Obviously.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.121
Wait, but why did it take you so long,

20:23.188 --> 20:25.290
if you only looked through a third of it?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.692
Okay, maybe it was half.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.061
But you have to see
this one thing, please?

20:29.127 --> 20:30.395
Please? Please? Okay.

20:31.363 --> 20:34.633
Justin, he was doing
this health story, right?

20:34.700 --> 20:37.803
And he got the insurance company
to pay for a little girl's operation,

20:37.869 --> 20:42.507
and this little angel,
she made him a homemade card.

20:43.542 --> 20:45.010
To thank him.

20:45.077 --> 20:48.347
Are you not dying?

20:48.413 --> 20:50.649
Okay, fine, I'll put it back,
I'll put it back.

21:00.392 --> 21:01.526
All right, no stress.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.663
Can you help me gather all this stuff
and we'll organize it later?

21:04.730 --> 21:05.797
We?

21:05.864 --> 21:09.167
Yes, the party planner's coming
and I can't have all of this. Please?

21:10.268 --> 21:11.670
Thank you.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.006
Okay.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.447
Is this a pair of stockings?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.816
You know what? Just put it away.

21:24.883 --> 21:26.151
Just put it away.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.953
No, let me see. Let me see.

21:33.325 --> 21:34.926
Never speak of this again.

21:34.993 --> 21:36.461
Are you kidding?

21:37.262 --> 21:39.297
This is perfect party banter.

21:39.364 --> 21:41.466
I'm sure everyone will have an opinion.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.468
"I think Justin's a crossdresser."

21:43.535 --> 21:46.004
"Well, I heard he was a cat burglar."

21:46.071 --> 21:48.407
"I bet he uses
the stockings as a dew rag."

21:48.473 --> 21:52.377
You just leave
Justin's special stockings alone.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.480
Relax. I'm not even gonna be here.

21:56.114 --> 21:57.416
What do you mean?

21:57.983 --> 22:00.185
I get enough of you people
during business hours.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.854
I am newly single. My nights are my own.

22:02.921 --> 22:05.223
No, no. I won't have anyone to talk to.

22:05.290 --> 22:06.558
I mean, Aaliyah's amazing,

22:06.625 --> 22:08.660
but she's on the company payroll.

22:08.727 --> 22:09.995
So am I.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.263
You know what I mean, Ty.

22:11.329 --> 22:12.798
Do you have any idea how hard it is

22:12.864 --> 22:15.667
for a 40-year-old woman
to make new friends?

22:15.734 --> 22:17.969
It's sad and creepy.

22:18.036 --> 22:20.539
Fine. Count me in.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.974
But between this mess, and the party?

22:23.608 --> 22:25.477
You owe me favors
for the rest of the year.

22:25.544 --> 22:26.678
I'll take it.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.780
Can you hand me that crucifix?

22:34.386 --> 22:36.088
Hey, everyone.

22:36.154 --> 22:37.589
Sorry. I'm sorry to interrupt.

22:37.656 --> 22:39.725
I just wanted to apologize

22:39.791 --> 22:42.194
for my unprofessional behavior yesterday.

22:42.861 --> 22:46.565
When faced with the opposing view
of a fellow colleague, I...

22:47.999 --> 22:51.703
handled the situation very poorly,

22:52.437 --> 22:54.439
and reacted out of anger.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.376
You know, one of my goals,
while sitting at the anchor desk

22:58.443 --> 23:02.547
is to make sure that GDU
feels like a true family operation,

23:02.614 --> 23:04.916
where everyone
has a voice to speak their truth,

23:04.983 --> 23:07.619
and that everyone's point of view
is respected,

23:07.686 --> 23:09.154
even when others disagree with it.

23:09.888 --> 23:13.225
That being said, the invitation
to my home is still open,

23:13.291 --> 23:16.862
and I truly hope to see
you all there tonight.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.065
Thank you for the apology, Mary Jane.
It was well said.

23:20.899 --> 23:25.437
And I have faith that the photographers
will capture how truly close we all are.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.206
All right?
Let's have a good show, everyone.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.811
Two of my favorite things...

23:32.878 --> 23:35.814
when someone can admit they're wrong
and a good party.

23:36.681 --> 23:37.949
See you.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.820
Great.

23:43.288 --> 23:47.025
As soon as I wrap up with work,
I'm on my way. Okay. Bye.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.028
Hey...

23:51.563 --> 23:53.999
I know we're in a weird place right now,

23:55.333 --> 23:56.935
but since my party's a work party,

23:57.002 --> 24:00.472
I was hoping that we could put
our differences aside and you could come.

24:01.072 --> 24:03.575
No, I'm sorry, I cannot come,

24:03.642 --> 24:06.444
and even if I could, I wouldn't go
to your stupid party, okay?

24:06.511 --> 24:08.113
Hasn't this gone on long enough?

24:08.180 --> 24:09.948
- Come on.
- No, Mary Jane.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.751
You've got to stop expecting this
to blow over, all right?

24:12.818 --> 24:15.520
I meant every single word I said to you.
I am done!

24:22.160 --> 24:24.296
- Hey, Jovan.
- Hey, what's up?

24:24.362 --> 24:25.997
Come on in. Come on in.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.800
You told me to meet you if I wanted
to go to the council meeting?

24:28.867 --> 24:30.836
- Right.
- You still going?

24:30.902 --> 24:33.438
- I am, yeah.
- Is it okay if I tag along?

24:33.505 --> 24:34.806
Yeah, of course.

24:34.873 --> 24:37.108
- All right, let me grab my keys.
- All right, man.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.385
Hey, I'm Jovan.

24:47.452 --> 24:49.855
- You're Patrick's daughter.
- Yeah, Niecy.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.357
Yeah, me and your dad
are going to a meeting together.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.293
- What kind of drugs are you on?
- What?

24:55.360 --> 24:59.064
- You said a meeting.
- Nah, not that type of meeting.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.433
Patrick, you know,
he's been giving speeches

25:01.499 --> 25:04.336
and talking at city council meetings
and rallies,

25:04.402 --> 25:06.872
and answering questions
about "Black Lives Matter".

25:06.938 --> 25:08.773
He's out to mobilize the community.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.042
Well, he ain't told me
nothing about all that.

25:11.109 --> 25:12.911
He's been helping a lot of people.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.082
Niecy, I'm about to step out for a bit.

25:17.148 --> 25:18.383
Did you and Jovan meet?

25:18.450 --> 25:19.618
Yeah, we just met.

25:20.151 --> 25:22.320
Okay, I'll be home a little later. Bye.

25:22.387 --> 25:24.456
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.409
Hey, Emma.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.844
A quick question.

25:47.545 --> 25:49.180
Do you know what's going on with Kara?

25:50.315 --> 25:53.251
- No idea.
- Something happening with her kids?

25:53.318 --> 25:56.288
You know, honestly, if it's not
about work, it's not on my radar.

25:56.354 --> 25:57.989
But given her lack of focus,

25:58.056 --> 26:01.226
I think I should have Garrett
sign off the research for this segment.

26:01.293 --> 26:02.360
Did she not approve it?

26:02.427 --> 26:05.563
She did, but I heard
how she screwed up that Ronda story.

26:05.630 --> 26:07.332
That wasn't her fault, Emma.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.634
I just started here.
I'm trying to keep this job.

26:09.701 --> 26:10.902
Your research.

26:14.339 --> 26:17.108
Okay, well, if Kara turned this in,

26:17.175 --> 26:19.144
it has been fully vetted
and it's good to go,

26:19.210 --> 26:22.414
and if anyone has any questions,
they can ask me personally.

26:32.724 --> 26:33.892
<i>Operation failed.</i>

26:33.959 --> 26:35.160
No, no.

26:35.927 --> 26:38.363
Damn it, what is it? What is it?

26:42.567 --> 26:45.103
<i>- Operation failed.
- No! Shit!</i>

26:45.170 --> 26:47.005
Tell me he didn't change the code on me.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.774
Okay, okay.

26:50.342 --> 26:53.912
Zero, four, one, nine, seven, six.

26:54.512 --> 26:55.580
<i>Unlocked.</i>

26:55.647 --> 26:57.515
Thank you. Okay.

27:01.519 --> 27:03.288
Hey, Dad. You got a minute?

27:03.355 --> 27:04.756
I've got a question for you.

27:04.823 --> 27:06.291
Sure. What's going on?

27:07.392 --> 27:10.562
When I met Jovan,
he told me that you've been speaking

27:10.628 --> 27:13.298
at city council meetings and rallies.

27:13.365 --> 27:16.001
- Is that true?
- Yeah, it is.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.103
After I wrote that statement for you,

27:18.169 --> 27:20.638
community leaders reached out
and asked me to speak.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.240
How come you never invited me?

27:23.341 --> 27:26.244
Well, after the tasing,

27:26.311 --> 27:28.213
you wanted to put everything behind you.

27:28.680 --> 27:30.982
You weren't interested
in hearing that statement.

27:31.049 --> 27:34.119
- But I did. I listened.
- Yeah, only after we forced you to.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.558
To be honest, Niecy,

27:41.559 --> 27:44.295
I didn't think you wanted
to relive it all again, that's all.

27:44.362 --> 27:47.065
I did feel like that,
but this is different.

27:47.499 --> 27:49.768
There's nothing wrong
with letting me know about it.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.371
- Okay.
- Okay?

27:53.438 --> 27:54.739
Okay, I will.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.914
Hey, let's get this party started.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.916
I'm so glad you could come.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.485
And Justin's box?

28:07.552 --> 28:09.988
- Back safely where it belongs.
- Good girl.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.158
Look who else is here.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.760
I told you she's on
a strictly business kick with me.

28:15.827 --> 28:17.762
Please. I'm sure by the end of the night,

28:17.829 --> 28:20.799
you'll be braiding each other's hair
and sharing your dick pics.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.100
Stop it.

28:22.167 --> 28:26.304
And, if not, Kara can't keep giving you
the cold shoulder forever, boo.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.907
- Let's hope not.
- Now, what can I help with?

28:28.973 --> 28:31.176
You know?
You can man the door while I change.

28:31.242 --> 28:32.944
- Gotcha.
- Thank you.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.695
Here we go.

28:51.696 --> 28:53.665
- Yes.
- You like?

28:54.566 --> 28:57.168
Don't worry,
you are going to rule this party.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.137
You are absolutely right.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.138
Yes.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.510
I'll be... damned!

29:05.577 --> 29:07.112
Come... come on.

29:07.612 --> 29:08.913
Are you kidding me?

29:08.980 --> 29:12.484
This ditzy bitch
let her friend come into my home

29:12.550 --> 29:14.385
with a racist billboard on her head.

29:14.452 --> 29:15.987
Mary Jane, remember.

29:16.988 --> 29:19.357
She's a crazy bag lady on 5th Avenue.

29:19.858 --> 29:22.293
She's a crazy bag lady on 5th Avenue.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.864
- A crazy bag lady on 5th Avenue.
- The photographer's here.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.766
Are you okay if I leave you alone?

29:28.833 --> 29:30.368
Yeah, no, it's...

29:30.935 --> 29:32.871
It's time to take
the training wheels off.

29:33.771 --> 29:35.039
I promise.

29:36.975 --> 29:39.644
- Hey, Mary Jane.
- Hi, Dani.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.312
Your loft is gorgeous.

29:41.379 --> 29:43.882
You must earn a fortune
to be able to afford this.

29:43.948 --> 29:46.417
Well, I do all right,
you know, for a diversity hire.

29:46.484 --> 29:47.986
You really do.

29:48.553 --> 29:50.722
Okay, I've gotta ask a question.

29:50.788 --> 29:52.590
I was looking at that bookshelf,

29:52.657 --> 29:54.526
and I saw an award
you got in high school.

29:54.592 --> 29:55.994
Your last name is Patterson?

29:56.060 --> 29:58.296
Yeah, my stage name is "Mary Jane Paul."

29:58.363 --> 30:01.766
Right. Well, my given name
is Daniella Hollingsworth,

30:01.833 --> 30:04.102
but I like to keep it
short and simple, you know,

30:04.169 --> 30:06.037
like my idol Glenn Beck.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.139
Well, that makes perfect sense.

30:08.206 --> 30:09.474
So, what's your first name?

30:09.541 --> 30:12.710
Is it one of those exotic names
that's kind of hard to pronounce?

30:12.777 --> 30:16.414
No, it's Pauletta, after my father.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.484
Oh, my God, best story ever.

30:24.689 --> 30:26.090
Wait. Wait.

30:28.626 --> 30:30.461
Why'd you give Dani the finger?

30:30.528 --> 30:32.964
Everything that she says
is racist and incendiary.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.432
What happened to your mantra?

30:34.499 --> 30:36.434
I tried to picture her
as a crazy bag lady,

30:36.501 --> 30:39.504
but those 1000-dollar Louis Vuitton
didn't go with the vision.

30:39.571 --> 30:40.838
Okay...

30:41.406 --> 30:45.577
I know that you took a picture of me

30:45.643 --> 30:47.745
flipping the bird to my co-worker.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.316
- Gonna need you to delete that.
- Not a chance.

30:51.382 --> 30:52.383
Excuse me?

30:52.884 --> 30:55.086
That picture could be
a career-changer for me.

30:55.153 --> 30:58.022
I'm gonna tell you
how this is gonna work.

30:58.089 --> 31:00.625
Real plain, real simple.

31:00.692 --> 31:04.329
If you don't delete
the photo, I'm gonna...

31:04.395 --> 31:06.130
What Mary Jane means is...

31:06.197 --> 31:10.168
you're here to capture
the comradery of the GDU crew.

31:10.235 --> 31:13.638
We don't feel the image
really represents that.

31:15.306 --> 31:17.275
- No.
- What you've got to do...

31:18.509 --> 31:22.313
Go entertain your guests. I got this.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.719
Hi.

31:28.353 --> 31:29.520
What's it gonna take?

31:29.587 --> 31:33.591
Look, I'm freelance.
This picture's my golden ticket.

31:33.658 --> 31:37.562
My firm runs hundreds of accounts
in New York City alone.

31:37.629 --> 31:41.899
I personally book those events
and I control all the celebrity access.

31:41.966 --> 31:44.936
You want your golden ticket?
You gotta go through me.

31:45.003 --> 31:46.404
We're talking A-list?

31:47.038 --> 31:50.975
Benny Medina is throwing a surprise party
for JLo next week.

31:51.042 --> 31:53.511
Tons of A-list celebs.

32:00.952 --> 32:02.153
Thank you.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.458
Who the hell are those guys?

32:07.959 --> 32:09.560
Mary Jane, they're my friends.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.729
I invited them.
I didn't think that you'd mind.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.666
This is turning into a Deploraball.

32:14.732 --> 32:16.901
Okay, what this party
needs right now is music.

32:16.968 --> 32:18.569
I am feeling that idea.

32:18.636 --> 32:21.005
Okay, what about that one?

32:21.072 --> 32:22.640
Nope. That ain't the one.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.976
This song is on every brother's playlist.

32:25.043 --> 32:28.112
Exactly. White folks
haven't discovered that yet.

32:28.179 --> 32:29.614
Girl, gimme your phone.

32:31.182 --> 32:33.384
- Yeah, here we go.
- Really?

32:34.519 --> 32:37.455
My God, y'all, I love this song!

32:39.324 --> 32:41.592
Bring those moves in
so everybody can see them.

32:41.659 --> 32:42.593
All right.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.616
My turn.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.658
Do you think that we satisfied the media,

33:13.725 --> 33:16.694
convinced them
that we are "The Brady Bunch"?

33:16.761 --> 33:19.964
Ronda would have never subjected herself
to this kind of stunt.

33:20.031 --> 33:24.135
Well, I see that you are playing the role
of the angry drunk in the family, Aaron.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.237
Come on, Aaron, it's time for shots.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.040
There you go.

33:29.107 --> 33:30.541
- Cheers!
- Salut!

33:32.276 --> 33:33.644
Get in the shot.

33:41.386 --> 33:44.822
Well, we had to extinguish some fires,

33:44.889 --> 33:48.860
- but I think it's shaping up all right.
- You think so?

33:48.926 --> 33:52.430
Yeah. Definitely time for you
to get off the clock, you hear me?

33:52.497 --> 33:55.433
- I insist.
- If you insist.

33:55.500 --> 33:56.901
I do.

33:56.968 --> 33:58.736
Major throwback.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.539
This was the theme
to my 25th birthday party.

34:01.606 --> 34:05.109
Wow. I don't think I even had
my driver's license yet.

34:07.578 --> 34:09.447
Ty? Ty?

34:10.715 --> 34:11.883
Ty?

34:12.450 --> 34:14.752
Ty! What are you doing?

34:14.819 --> 34:16.354
Making America great again.

34:16.421 --> 34:18.556
One closeted Republican at a time.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.658
I can't...

34:32.036 --> 34:33.371
Where's Mary Jane?

34:33.438 --> 34:34.572
I have no idea.

34:35.173 --> 34:36.941
Everybody, come on, gather around.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.458
Kara?

34:54.392 --> 34:55.593
Mary Jane...

34:58.763 --> 35:00.131
It's my dad.

35:01.199 --> 35:02.533
It's okay.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.202
This is the end for him.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.506
I'm so sorry.

35:22.086 --> 35:23.754
You're still here?

35:25.189 --> 35:27.158
Somebody had to lock up.

35:31.028 --> 35:32.864
Wow, by the looks of this place,

35:32.930 --> 35:36.400
I'd say Operation
"Make GDU the Perfect Family"

35:36.467 --> 35:38.102
appears to be a success.

35:38.169 --> 35:39.937
Yeah, I'm sorry I ducked out.

35:40.004 --> 35:42.173
Kara's dad is dying and...

35:42.240 --> 35:43.608
I just went to be with her.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.877
I apologize for leaving you here.

35:45.943 --> 35:48.045
No, no, that's sweet.

35:48.112 --> 35:50.181
So, everything turned out okay here?

35:50.248 --> 35:52.750
I managed to deal with Dani

35:52.817 --> 35:55.520
and my sanity is still intact.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.223
When did you become this wise sage?

35:59.290 --> 36:01.025
No, seriously, are you a Buddhist?

36:01.092 --> 36:03.160
No, no, I'm not Buddhist.

36:03.227 --> 36:06.230
My mom was bipolar, actually.

36:06.297 --> 36:10.368
She taught me how to have
empathy for people who suffer.

36:10.434 --> 36:12.069
So, you can see somebody like Dani

36:12.136 --> 36:14.472
and have compassion.

36:14.539 --> 36:18.142
Exactly. And the truth is,
it's more for me than them,

36:18.209 --> 36:20.211
'cause it makes my life so much easier.

36:20.278 --> 36:22.380
Mad props to you, girl, cause...

36:22.980 --> 36:25.883
you are wise beyond your years.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.318
Stop.

36:27.385 --> 36:28.920
No, I'm serious.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.655
With people like you leading the way,

36:30.721 --> 36:33.257
future generations might
actually have some hope.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.826
- Preach, queen.
- You know.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.964
Well, I should get going.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.099
You know, hey, Aaliyah.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.637
I hope this doesn't sound weird
or anything, but...

36:47.538 --> 36:49.941
would you wanna hang out some time?

36:50.007 --> 36:52.176
I mean, nothing work related
or anything,

36:52.243 --> 36:53.978
like, not like this, but...

36:55.146 --> 36:58.082
just like, pure,
unadulterated socializing?

36:58.149 --> 37:00.151
I swear I'm not a creeper.

37:00.217 --> 37:01.852
You're being serious right now?

37:01.919 --> 37:02.954
Yeah.

37:03.020 --> 37:06.757
Yes, I would totally love
to hang out with you.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.059
Cool.

37:11.429 --> 37:14.832
No. What are you doing?

37:15.700 --> 37:16.734
Care to join me?

37:21.505 --> 37:24.075
- Would you like to do the honors?
- Sure.

37:24.141 --> 37:25.910
Wait, but first...

37:30.314 --> 37:31.616
Later, sucker.

37:35.953 --> 37:38.255
If I was gonna tell you
how we need to build trust

37:38.322 --> 37:40.191
between our neighborhoods
and the police,

37:40.992 --> 37:42.827
it needed to start right here with me.

37:43.561 --> 37:48.032
When I overcame my drug addiction,
I learned to listen and to trust myself.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.703
It wasn't until then
that I could listen to others.

37:54.438 --> 37:58.609
Listening and understanding,
one person at a time.

37:58.676 --> 38:01.579
That's how we build trust
between ourselves and our community

38:01.646 --> 38:03.347
between our youth and the police,

38:03.414 --> 38:05.149
by really listening to each other.

38:07.852 --> 38:11.155
Yeah, I'll do your color through here.
I think we could do that.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.425
Niecy.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.460
I thought I was clear before.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.396
There's nothing more
I can do to help you.

38:19.463 --> 38:20.631
No, you were clear.

38:21.565 --> 38:24.168
But I have a proposition
for you now, if you will listen.

38:24.235 --> 38:26.070
Girl, five minutes.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.573
It's been hard for me to face up
to the mess that I made of my life.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.443
But I have two kids depending on me now.

38:32.510 --> 38:34.612
You said if something is truly important,

38:34.679 --> 38:39.016
you do the work
and you don't make excuses.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.751
Well, I'm ready to do the work,

38:40.818 --> 38:43.054
and I'm done making excuses.

38:43.587 --> 38:46.424
So, if you will please
give me a second chance,

38:47.158 --> 38:48.626
and give me my booth back.

38:50.428 --> 38:52.196
I don't have any more room, Niecy.

38:52.263 --> 38:53.230
I'm sorry.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.301
All right, well...

38:57.368 --> 38:58.803
I appreciate the opportunity

38:58.869 --> 39:01.739
and thank you for your time, Claudia.

39:03.074 --> 39:04.175
Take care.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.813
Wait, Niecy.

39:10.414 --> 39:14.018
Okay, how about you be
my new shampoo and sweep girl?

39:14.085 --> 39:15.686
You can build up hours in the salon,

39:15.753 --> 39:18.255
and we'll revisit
getting your booth back.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.558
All right. It's a deal. It's a deal.

39:21.292 --> 39:22.259
Great.

39:25.162 --> 39:26.430
You can start today.

39:27.765 --> 39:29.200
Okay.

39:30.735 --> 39:31.769
Thank you.

39:35.272 --> 39:36.707
<i>¿Cómo estás, Lupe?</i>

39:36.774 --> 39:39.143
<i>Muy bien, Miss Mary Jane.
I made coffee for you.</i>

39:39.210 --> 39:42.780
Before I go, I found this
under your couch. It looked important.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.048
<i>Gracias.</i>

39:48.652 --> 39:50.821
Nope, nope. I'm not gonna do it.

39:50.888 --> 39:52.690
I'm gonna leave it there with the others.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.892
I will return it when I can.

39:54.959 --> 39:58.129
I'm not gonna look at you.
I'm not gonna do it.

40:02.266 --> 40:03.501
Damn it.

40:08.806 --> 40:11.175
Justin's worth 30 million dollars?
