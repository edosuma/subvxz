00:02.800 --> 00:04.500
- WHY, HUH?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.100
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE
JOANNE'S CARD?

00:06.100 --> 00:07.733
- WHAT?
I CAN TAKE HER CARD.

00:07.733 --> 00:10.033
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN
I'M GOING TO NEED SOME...

00:10.033 --> 00:12.867
DENTAL INSURANCE.

00:12.867 --> 00:16.000

A REASON SHE'S YOUR EX-WIFE.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.667

[grunts]
WHY DO I EVEN--

00:24.333 --> 00:27.200
WEREN'T YOU TRYING
TO MAKE IT WORK WITH AMY?

00:27.200 --> 00:29.500
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE
HAPPY WITH AMY

00:29.500 --> 00:33.233
AND UNHAPPY
WITH JOANNE THE NUTCRACKER.

00:33.233 --> 00:34.400
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:34.400 --> 00:35.800
YOU AND RAY

00:35.800 --> 00:38.833
- ME?

00:38.833 --> 00:41.200
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.867
YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO--

00:43.867 --> 00:45.567
I DON'T KNOW.

00:45.567 --> 00:47.967
- I SAID ANNOUNCE ME,
FRANK.

00:47.967 --> 00:50.267
WHAT KIND OF ANNOUNCING
IS THAT?

00:50.267 --> 00:51.600
- OH, JUST DO IT.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.333
EVERYTHING HAS
TO BE A BIG DEAL.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.667
- DO YOU HAVE
TO RUIN EVERYTHING?

00:54.667 --> 00:55.767
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE HERE?

IT IS A BIG DEAL.

01:19.533 --> 01:22.700
AS YOU KNOW, MY BIRTHDAY
IS COMING UP,

01:22.700 --> 01:25.767
AND I HAVE SECRETLY
BEEN PUTTING ASIDE MONEY

01:25.767 --> 01:27.833
FOR 45 YEARS.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.700
AND THIS IS WHAT I WANT.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.600
- I WANT HALF THAT MONEY.
- OH.

01:31.600 --> 01:32.633
- I WANT ALL THAT MONEY.

01:32.633 --> 01:34.567
THAT MONEY'S MINE.
- QUIET.

01:34.567 --> 01:36.833
SO I'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH
MY MOTHER'S COUSIN COLLETTA,

01:36.833 --> 01:39.400

AND THE KIDS TOO!

01:59.200 --> 02:00.833
EVERYONE.

02:00.833 --> 02:04.333
- YOU KNOW, MAYBE I CAN TELL
MY LADY TROUBLES TO THE POPE.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.967
- LOOK AT IT.
IT'S A LITTLE, TINY VILLAGE--

02:05.967 --> 02:08.267
- OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

02:08.267 --> 02:09.600
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

02:09.600 --> 02:11.600
ALL RIGHT, STOP DANCING.
STOP, STOP. LISTEN.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.867
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
IS A VACATION WITH MY FAMILY?

02:13.867 --> 02:15.267
OKAY?
- YEAH.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.200
- DON'T WE WANT A VACATION
FROM MY FAMILY?

02:17.200 --> 02:18.667
- IF THEY'RE GOING
TO BOTHER ME ANYWAY,

02:18.667 --> 02:22.000
I'LL TAKE BOTHERED IN ITALY.
[laughs]

02:22.000 --> 02:25.667

02:34.467 --> 02:38.100
I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED
IN OTHER CULTURES.

02:40.467 --> 02:42.867
- [laughing]
OKAY.

02:42.867 --> 02:44.667
YOU KNOW,
IN THE PAST,

02:44.667 --> 02:49.600
YOUR...DUMBNESS
HAS GOTTEN IN THE WAY

02:49.600 --> 02:51.633

02:51.633 --> 02:56.633
THE BOOK CLUB, THEATER,
HAVING CONVERSATIONS.

02:56.633 --> 02:58.767
BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY
THIS ONE THING,

02:58.767 --> 03:01.400
AND WE WON'T
HAVE TO DISCUSS IT ANYMORE.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.233
YOU'RE NOT BLOWING THIS
FOR ME, PAL!

03:05.233 --> 03:07.467
WE'RE GOING TO ITALY!

03:07.467 --> 03:09.200

I CAN'T TASTE ANYTHING.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.833
I GOT A COLD FROM THAT
DAMN AIR CONDITIONER ON THE VAN.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.400
IT'S FREEZING IN THERE.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.767
UH.

13:48.733 --> 13:51.800
YOU GOT TO CHANGE MONEY.
THAT'S A SCAM.

13:51.800 --> 13:55.467
NOBODY SEES THAT?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.667
- I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO FIT IN THERE EITHER.

15:19.667 --> 15:23.067

AND PUSH WITH YOUR ARMS.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.733

20:55.800 --> 20:58.167
BUT NOW I'M HERE...

20:58.167 --> 21:02.733

21:02.733 --> 21:06.133
IT'S LIKE A DREAM.

21:06.133 --> 21:09.733
I'M FROM LYNBROOK.
I WORKED MY WHOLE LIFE.

21:09.733 --> 21:13.067
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE

21:15.667 --> 21:16.967
- I WAS JUST WONDERING,

21:16.967 --> 21:21.067
COULD YOUR LEG
BE IN ANOTHER PLACE?

21:27.567 --> 21:30.333
- I HAPPEN
TO BE SERIOUS.

21:30.333 --> 21:33.467
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

21:35.433 --> 21:40.300
