WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:09.107
Just so you know, Morgan, Roxie
and the cat drank out of that carton.

00:09.278 --> 00:13.442
Ick. Well, that explains the lipstick,
the crumbs and the fur.

00:13.616 --> 00:14.947
So, Louisa, what's going on?

00:15.118 --> 00:17.814
I mean, I haven't heard from you
since the 1-cent frame sale.

00:17.987 --> 00:20.353
The phone works both ways.

00:20.523 --> 00:22.423
Anyhoo, I wanted to warn you

00:22.592 --> 00:26.153
that since so little magic
has been used around here lately,

00:26.329 --> 00:30.231
the house is about to undergo
a magical systems check.

00:30.399 --> 00:33.129
What? I can't have magic
shooting off willy-nilly.

00:33.302 --> 00:35.361
Mortals live here,
and they don't know I'm a witch.

00:35.538 --> 00:38.302
Oh, that's going to be tricky.

00:38.474 --> 00:40.635
Lots of luck to you.

00:40.810 --> 00:42.334
No, wait, you can't go.
I need to know...

00:42.512 --> 00:45.879
- Who are you talking to?
- Uh, to you, heh, obviously.

00:46.048 --> 00:48.949
- Good morning.
- Friendly but unconvincing.

00:49.352 --> 00:51.252
- I know I heard voices.
- Voices?

00:51.420 --> 00:53.081
Roxie, really,
the things you come up with.

00:54.457 --> 00:57.392
- What in the heck is that?
- I'm sterilizing the mail.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.893
I mean, you never know where
the mailman's hands have been.

01:01.063 --> 01:02.291
Juice?

01:04.000 --> 01:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.670 --> 01:43.730
What is taking them so long?
Roxie, Morgan, come on!

01:43.907 --> 01:47.308
I gotta keep them out until this
whole magical systems check is over.

01:47.477 --> 01:49.775
You can't keep them
at the diner forever.

01:49.946 --> 01:51.413
What's your plan
if something happens

01:51.581 --> 01:54.345
while Laverne and Shirley
are actually in the house?

01:54.517 --> 01:56.508
Let's just say I'll be making good use
of the phrase

01:56.686 --> 01:57.880
"It must have been the cat. "

01:58.054 --> 02:00.955
<i>- Qu√©?
- Ladies, while I'm still young!</i>

02:01.124 --> 02:03.217
I wanna get to the diner
before the soup hardens.

02:03.393 --> 02:06.453
What's the hurry?
I've only got one eye lined.

02:06.630 --> 02:08.222
Yeah, we just had breakfast
two hours ago.

02:08.398 --> 02:09.626
The juice might have gone bad.

02:09.799 --> 02:12.768
Oh, well, uh, nothing soothes
the stomach like chili cheese fries.

02:12.936 --> 02:14.369
Okay, let's get a move on.

02:14.537 --> 02:17.938
Yep, let's go or the day will be over
before we even get out the door.

02:18.708 --> 02:23.168
So then she says,
"I left my harp in Sam Clam's disco. "

02:23.346 --> 02:25.746
- Get it?
- Got it, and I'm gone.

02:25.915 --> 02:28.281
- I got a million of them.
- And we've heard every one.

02:28.451 --> 02:29.713
- See you.
- Where are you going?

02:29.886 --> 02:32.377
- You're going, uh, shopping, right?
- No, home.

02:32.555 --> 02:33.579
Uh, well, that's cool.

02:33.757 --> 02:37.022
You know, I just assumed, you know,
with the stores open, having big sales

02:37.193 --> 02:39.161
and you in last season's jeans,
maybe...

02:39.329 --> 02:40.796
I'll be at the mall. Don't wait up.

02:41.798 --> 02:44.266
Well, now that Morgan's gone
over the wall, I'm taking off too.

02:44.434 --> 02:46.561
I've got an appointment.
I wanna stop by the house.

02:46.736 --> 02:48.567
Wait, when did you two
become such homebodies?

02:48.738 --> 02:51.832
Okay, so this appointment, um,
sounds pretty mysterious.

02:52.008 --> 02:53.908
- It's no big deal.
- Well, it is to me.

02:54.077 --> 02:56.739
Sit. Tell. Order something.

02:56.913 --> 02:59.040
You're not leaving here
until you tell me all about it.

02:59.215 --> 03:01.775
Sabrina, it's kind of personal.

03:01.951 --> 03:04.283
So personal
you can't tell your best friend?

03:04.454 --> 03:05.921
Okay, but it's a little embarrassing.

03:06.089 --> 03:08.284
You've gotta promise
not to tell anyone.

03:08.958 --> 03:10.721
- Promise.
- I'm seeing a doctor.

03:11.094 --> 03:14.461
- That's great. Congratulations.
- No, I'm not dating him.

03:14.631 --> 03:18.397
I'm seeing a doctor about possibly
having a tattoo removed.

03:18.568 --> 03:21.128
- Wow, I didn't know you had a tattoo.
- That's the secret part.

03:21.304 --> 03:23.772
I got it when I was in high school
and have regretted it since.

03:23.940 --> 03:25.703
I just want it gone.

03:26.276 --> 03:29.370
Uh, does it have some long,
seedy story behind it?

03:29.546 --> 03:32.845
I wish, heh. It says...

03:33.016 --> 03:34.847
This is just between us, right?

03:36.186 --> 03:38.416
You know when you're young
and get obsessed with a band?

03:38.588 --> 03:41.148
Oh, totally. I had a wall
full of Nine Inch Nails posters.

03:41.324 --> 03:43.451
Which, ironically,
I put up with thumbtacks.

03:43.626 --> 03:46.186
So, what band left
a "permanent" impression on you?

03:46.362 --> 03:48.023
Hanson.

03:48.198 --> 03:50.860
My tattoo says "I heart Hanson. "

03:51.401 --> 03:55.201
- I'm guessing you lost a bet.
- Mm, if only that were true.

03:55.371 --> 03:58.238
Great, now I'm late and I'm not gonna
have a chance to go home.

03:58.408 --> 04:00.933
Excellent...
Decision to have that tattoo removed.

04:01.111 --> 04:05.138
Yeah, so when you're at the doctor's,
um, take your time.

04:05.315 --> 04:06.373
Get to know him.

04:06.549 --> 04:08.449
You know,
maybe you'll get that date after all.

04:14.090 --> 04:17.286
Okay, I've successfully
capped the geyser of Sparkle Farkle

04:17.459 --> 04:19.860
and managed to put out the fire
in the number-six cauldron.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.589
- How are things going up here?
- All clear.

04:22.766 --> 04:25.792
The armchair started to talk,
but I threatened to shred its dust ruffle.

04:26.736 --> 04:28.795
Good cat. So how are our girls?

04:28.972 --> 04:30.496
Back, but not to worry.

04:30.673 --> 04:32.971
They're in the kitchen,
still none the wiser.

04:33.143 --> 04:34.576
Perfect.

04:36.513 --> 04:37.741
Not so perfect.

04:39.682 --> 04:41.081
Aah, stop.

04:41.251 --> 04:43.742
No. Open.

04:44.354 --> 04:48.916
Oh, good. No, stop, stop.
Close, close, close!

04:49.092 --> 04:51.026
Sabrina, we have a problem.

04:51.194 --> 04:53.958
Uh, the cat did it. He's crazy.
I'm thinking of having him put down.

04:54.130 --> 04:55.722
No, not Salem, Roxie.

04:55.899 --> 04:57.696
Uh, fine,
then we'll have her put down too.

04:57.867 --> 04:58.891
That's the problem.

04:59.068 --> 05:01.400
I think something
is seriously wrong with her.

05:01.571 --> 05:03.505
I just overheard her on the phone
to a doctor.

05:03.673 --> 05:06.198
She's scheduling an appointment
to have something removed.

05:06.376 --> 05:09.777
I think that she may be dying,
or worse.

05:09.946 --> 05:11.413
I'm really kind of busy right now.

05:11.581 --> 05:14.141
I know,
and you're doing that all wrong.

05:14.317 --> 05:17.684
This exercise is meant
for toning the thighs and the glutes.

05:17.854 --> 05:20.846
I'm sure if there were anything wrong,
Roxie would've let us know.

05:21.024 --> 05:22.457
No, I asked her about it,

05:22.625 --> 05:26.356
and all she said
was something about a MYOB.

05:26.529 --> 05:28.690
- "Mind your own business"?
- Great.

05:28.865 --> 05:32.357
Now you're shutting me out too.
You know, I am just worried about her.

05:32.535 --> 05:35.026
Look, Morgan, you have to trust me.
It's gonna be okay.

05:35.205 --> 05:37.435
There's nothing to worry about.
It's a simple procedure.

05:37.607 --> 05:41.304
Procedure? Oh, poor Roxie.

05:41.477 --> 05:45.345
I wish I'd been nicer to her.
What does she have, like six months?

05:45.515 --> 05:49.474
No, no, no, it's gonna be fine, really.
It's just, she's having a tattoo removed.

05:49.986 --> 05:54.389
Oh, is that all? Oh, I am so relieved.

05:54.557 --> 05:57.822
- I could do this for hours.
- Really? Great.

05:58.628 --> 05:59.686
Knock yourself out, ha, ha.

05:59.863 --> 06:01.797
Hey, and don't repeat what I told you
about Roxie.

06:01.965 --> 06:03.557
She's really kind of sensitive about it.

06:03.733 --> 06:05.826
I promise.
You don't have to worry about me.

06:07.871 --> 06:11.102
Come on, just let me see it, please?
Just a peek.

06:11.274 --> 06:12.502
Get away from me.

06:13.509 --> 06:14.908
I can't believe you told her.

06:15.078 --> 06:16.978
- But she promised.
- So did you.

06:17.747 --> 06:19.647
Well, I'm sorry. It wasn't malicious.

06:19.816 --> 06:21.681
Look, I was just trying
to put her mind at ease.

06:21.851 --> 06:23.842
- She thought you were dying.
She's right.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.419
And believe me, I'd wanna die too

06:25.588 --> 06:27.886
if I had "I heart Hanson" on my butt.
Ha-ha-ha.

06:28.424 --> 06:30.016
You gave her details?

06:30.193 --> 06:32.684
Now, see, that's probably
where I crossed the line.

06:33.062 --> 06:35.360
The first time I ask you
to promise me something.

06:35.531 --> 06:37.931
Thanks a lot, Sabrina.
I thought I could trust you.

06:38.568 --> 06:40.832
Thanks a lot, Morgan.
I thought I could trust you.

06:41.004 --> 06:43.268
I'm not exactly sure why.

06:43.439 --> 06:44.463
Roxie, I'm sorry.

06:44.641 --> 06:46.666
I never should've told Morgan
about your tattoo.

06:46.843 --> 06:48.936
I shouldn't be surprised
you couldn't keep my secrets.

06:49.112 --> 06:51.376
The only secrets you're able to keep
are your own.

06:51.547 --> 06:54.107
What are you talking about?
I don't keep secrets from you.

06:54.284 --> 06:56.149
Give me a break.
Ever since I've known you,

06:56.319 --> 06:59.152
I've always felt there was something
you were hiding from everyone.

06:59.322 --> 07:01.984
You're always covering things up
and acting all cagey.

07:02.158 --> 07:04.319
I can't believe this.
I am so not cagey.

07:04.494 --> 07:06.223
Oh, please,
you're always being evasive

07:06.396 --> 07:08.660
or darting out of the room
unexplained.

07:08.831 --> 07:10.662
Then you come up
with these weird, lame excuses

07:10.833 --> 07:13.393
that couldn't possibly be true.

07:13.569 --> 07:15.196
Just changing the bag.

07:15.371 --> 07:18.067
That's right up there
with sterilizing the mail.

07:18.241 --> 07:21.210
Bottom line,
I just don't trust you anymore.

07:22.578 --> 07:24.443
Hey, you try to come up
with a decent excuse

07:24.614 --> 07:27.981
while you're wrestling an upright.
Stop it.

07:30.019 --> 07:32.419
Trust is very important, Sabrina.

07:32.588 --> 07:35.148
Without it,
you can't run the really big cons.

07:35.758 --> 07:38.886
Did I ever tell you about the Bible scam
I ran in Kansas City back in the '20s?

07:39.062 --> 07:42.190
You don't know how horrible it feels
to have your best friend not trust you.

07:42.365 --> 07:43.730
Boo-hoo.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.425
Talk to me when you have
to groom yourself with your tongue.

07:47.603 --> 07:50.436
- Ooh. What about that one?
- "Elixir of Trust.

07:50.606 --> 07:54.406
Whoever serves this tonic will instantly
gain the trust of whomever drinks it. "

07:54.577 --> 07:56.135
I guarantee it.

07:56.312 --> 07:59.110
Jeez, is there anyone who's not doing
an endorsement these days?

08:02.118 --> 08:04.052
You know,
I don't know if I should do this.

08:04.220 --> 08:06.245
Well, with magic going off
left and right,

08:06.422 --> 08:08.219
I don't think you have a choice.

08:08.391 --> 08:10.916
Well, and 10 percent of the profits
goes to preserving the union.

08:11.094 --> 08:12.288
I'm sold.

08:15.031 --> 08:17.932
Hey, Roxie, I made smoothies.

08:18.101 --> 08:20.501
That certainly takes the sting
out of being betrayed.

08:20.670 --> 08:23.901
Come on, it's my sweet, nutritious way
of apologizing.

08:24.073 --> 08:25.370
Don't waste your breath.

08:25.541 --> 08:28.635
There's no way
that I'm accepting your apology.

08:35.551 --> 08:37.644
Because you have nothing
to apologize for.

08:37.820 --> 08:40.914
You're my best friend
in the whole wide world,

08:41.090 --> 08:42.182
and I totally trust you.

08:42.357 --> 08:45.156
If you say you had a good reason
for telling Morgan about my tattoo

08:45.328 --> 08:48.661
or slapping around the vacuum,
then I believe you.

08:48.831 --> 08:51.391
Wow, I gotta say,
Abe really knows his stuff.

08:51.567 --> 08:53.296
Hi, Sabrina. Just wanted to check...

08:53.469 --> 08:55.494
Not now.
- Did that painting just talk?

08:55.671 --> 08:57.730
Yeah, it's one of those, uh,
you know, gag pictures,

08:57.907 --> 08:59.238
like the fake flounder that sings.

08:59.409 --> 09:02.401
Yeah, you should hear her belt out
"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy. " Ha, ha.

09:02.845 --> 09:04.813
- That's cool.
- You bought that?

09:04.981 --> 09:07.643
I mean,
you're okay with that explanation?

09:07.817 --> 09:08.841
Of course.

09:09.018 --> 09:11.919
I know you'd never, ever lie
or keep secrets from me.

09:12.088 --> 09:14.750
I just feel bad
that I keep so many secrets from you.

09:14.924 --> 09:18.087
Well, never, ever is a little...
You keep secrets from me?

09:18.261 --> 09:19.819
Come on. I'll show you.

09:22.698 --> 09:26.134
Roxie, this place is so not you.

09:26.302 --> 09:27.860
That's why I've kept it a secret.

09:28.037 --> 09:30.164
I know I'm always railing
against the beauty myth,

09:30.339 --> 09:33.502
but even the most eco-friendly,
post-feminist, vegan girl in the world

09:33.676 --> 09:34.700
wants pretty toes.

09:34.877 --> 09:37.744
Hey, that goes for us meat-eating,
paper-wasting girls too.

09:37.914 --> 09:39.245
Thanks for sharing this with me.

09:39.415 --> 09:41.849
If I can't trust you with my secrets,
who can I trust?

09:42.018 --> 09:43.485
True, but let's not get carried away.

09:43.653 --> 09:46.087
You know, there are some things
better left unsaid.

09:48.624 --> 09:50.592
I miss my binkie.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.954
Aah! Too much information.

09:52.128 --> 09:54.358
<i>La-la-la, la-la-la</i>

09:56.065 --> 09:58.226
Oh, you silly, silly witch,

09:58.401 --> 10:00.869
leaving me with the Elixir of Trust.

10:01.037 --> 10:03.198
If I had thumbs,
I'd be twirling my whiskers right now

10:03.372 --> 10:04.805
and laughing maniacally.

10:05.942 --> 10:08.376
Perfect. Ha-ha-ha.

10:12.715 --> 10:18.585
Hmm, I feel like something
cold and fruity.

10:18.754 --> 10:21.018
Meow. Meow.

10:21.190 --> 10:23.852
Oh, hi, kitty. Oh, maybe a banana.

10:26.762 --> 10:29.560
Whatever you're hacking up,
take it outside.

10:29.732 --> 10:33.793
Oh, smoothies.
This should hit the spot.

10:36.839 --> 10:40.798
- Mm.
- Hey, Red, way to take a hint.

10:40.977 --> 10:45.277
- How are you talking to me?
- Trust me, all cats talk.

10:45.448 --> 10:47.712
- Would I lie to you?
- Oh, of course not.

10:47.884 --> 10:50.944
- I trust you.
- Enough to do whatever I want?

10:51.120 --> 10:52.883
- Of course.
- Excellent.

10:53.055 --> 10:55.785
Now twirl my whiskers
while I laugh maniacally.

11:00.062 --> 11:02.724
Yes, I'm serious, and...
- No, no, just hang up. Hang up.

11:02.899 --> 11:05.959
Look, you can't just call your boss
and quit out of the blue.

11:06.135 --> 11:08.035
You said if I wasn't
being creatively fulfilled...

11:08.204 --> 11:09.296
All right, Roxie, stop.

11:09.472 --> 11:10.939
You can't entrust me
with your secrets

11:11.107 --> 11:13.234
and ask me
to make life-altering decisions for you.

11:13.409 --> 11:17.778
I know, it's just that I have
such complete and total faith in you.

11:17.947 --> 11:20.040
I know you'd never let any harm
come to me.

11:20.216 --> 11:22.013
Not knowingly,
but you're getting carried...

11:22.185 --> 11:24.415
No! What are you doing?

11:24.587 --> 11:27.522
See? I knew you'd never, ever
let anything bad happen to me.

11:27.690 --> 11:30.352
Okay, you know what?
This is getting a little out of hand.

11:30.526 --> 11:31.720
We gotta get you home before...

11:31.894 --> 11:34.727
- Catch me, Sabrina!
- Roxie!

11:43.339 --> 11:45.136
Oh, dang!

11:46.709 --> 11:47.869
Oh, come on.

11:49.412 --> 11:50.845
Oh, so close.

11:52.248 --> 11:53.806
I knew I could trust you.

11:55.585 --> 11:58.019
A friend's undying devotion
and I didn't even break a nail.

11:58.187 --> 12:00.018
You'd think I'd feel all warm
and fuzzy inside.

12:01.490 --> 12:03.014
Roxie. Get out of the street!

12:03.926 --> 12:06.190
That bus came so close
to hitting my head,

12:06.362 --> 12:08.353
it was almost spiritual.

12:08.531 --> 12:11.466
Yeah, about as life-affirming
as when you were taunting that pit bull.

12:11.634 --> 12:14.501
All right, sit here
and count the floorboards...

12:14.670 --> 12:17.400
It's fun... While I go beat the tar
out of an ex-president

12:17.573 --> 12:19.871
and make sure the house
isn't inflicting itself on Morgan.

12:20.509 --> 12:21.771
Uh, what's going on here?

12:21.944 --> 12:25.209
Uh, nothing you need to furrow
your pretty little brow about.

12:25.381 --> 12:27.611
Just carry on
with whatever you were doing.

12:27.783 --> 12:30.513
Salem, I can't believe
that you're talking,

12:30.686 --> 12:33.177
because it is totally freaking me out.

12:33.356 --> 12:35.847
Oh, all cats talk. Salem told me so.

12:36.525 --> 12:37.583
I bet he did.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.421
Morgan, don't you have to use
the bathroom?

12:39.862 --> 12:42.160
- I don't think so.
- Salem.

12:42.798 --> 12:45.164
- You do.
- Now that you mention it...

12:46.335 --> 12:48.997
Salem, I cannot believe
you fed her the trust elixir.

12:49.171 --> 12:51.799
I'm this close to turning you over
to creepy Jimmy down the street.

12:51.974 --> 12:53.839
He has firecrackers
and very little supervision.

12:54.010 --> 12:56.171
Hey, you left the stuff out
on the counter.

12:56.345 --> 12:59.872
Besides, how is this any different
than what you did to Roxie?

13:00.049 --> 13:02.711
Oh, it's totally different.
I did it to fix a friendship.

13:02.885 --> 13:04.580
You did it to get a free tummy rub.

13:04.754 --> 13:06.221
As soon as I figure out the antidote,

13:06.389 --> 13:08.448
you can say sayonara
to your little geisha with...

13:08.624 --> 13:12.151
Wait a minute, did you say
I left it on the counter? Oh, man.

13:12.328 --> 13:14.694
Morgan, chop-chop!

13:14.864 --> 13:17.389
These grapes
aren't gonna peel themselves.

13:17.566 --> 13:18.726
No. No more.

13:18.901 --> 13:22.359
- I told you to count the floorboards.
- Did it. One hundred and eleven.

13:22.538 --> 13:24.233
Yes, but how many of them
have knots?

13:24.874 --> 13:28.241
One, two, three...

13:29.078 --> 13:30.102
"Do not pour down drain.

13:30.279 --> 13:32.179
May cause severe damage
to septic tank. "

13:32.348 --> 13:35.010
It's always a little scary
when it's bad for the sewage system.

13:35.184 --> 13:37.812
Oh, perfect. I'll just boil it away.

13:44.593 --> 13:45.651
Excellent.

13:45.828 --> 13:49.389
- Now that that's done...
- Thirty-four, 35...

13:49.565 --> 13:52.625
All right, you and I have
an appointment with a musty book,

13:52.802 --> 13:55.430
which, ironically, gets me
in more trouble than it gets me out of.

13:55.604 --> 13:56.832
Come on.

14:02.712 --> 14:06.409
- What in the?
- A pretty kitty is a happy kitty.

14:06.582 --> 14:08.072
This is part
of Cat-Appreciation Week.

14:09.452 --> 14:11.716
It comes right before
Selling-Them-on-eBay Week.

14:14.423 --> 14:16.186
- What?
- Hi, I'm your neighbor.

14:16.359 --> 14:18.759
Do these pants make me look fat?

14:18.928 --> 14:21.021
Why are you asking me?
Oh, no, don't say it.

14:21.197 --> 14:22.892
I just know I can trust you.

14:23.065 --> 14:25.590
- Oh, you said it.
- I trust her too.

14:25.768 --> 14:29.727
So do I.
I'm entrusting you with my life savings.

14:29.905 --> 14:31.202
Oh, no. Please go.

14:31.374 --> 14:34.400
Please, I don't want your money, sir.
And those pants are very slimming, sir.

14:35.778 --> 14:38.804
There she is.
That's the woman you'll be living with.

14:38.981 --> 14:41.415
I mean, who else
am I gonna trust them with?

14:41.584 --> 14:43.711
Okay, could you hold down the fort?
I'll be right back.

14:43.886 --> 14:46.855
And I think
she needs to be changed.

14:48.023 --> 14:50.218
Okay, how come
I didn't see that there?

14:51.927 --> 14:54.395
And who's playing with the lights?

14:57.066 --> 14:59.398
- Hello.
- Hi. Hi.

14:59.568 --> 15:01.058
If you're here
about the systems check,

15:01.237 --> 15:04.070
let's just say "Now is a bad time"
is the understatement of the century.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.105
I'm not here
about any systems check.

15:06.275 --> 15:09.972
What's going on with my eyes?
And when did this print get smaller?

15:10.146 --> 15:12.614
You're not gonna find the answer
to your problem in there.

15:12.782 --> 15:15.512
- How do you know?
- Perhaps I should introduce myself.

15:15.684 --> 15:18.915
- I'm Blind Faith.
- Oh, I so don't like where this is going.

15:19.455 --> 15:21.946
I don't suppose you're here
to help with my problem, hope, hope?

15:22.124 --> 15:24.024
No, I'm here to hand over the reins,
so to speak.

15:24.193 --> 15:26.525
Now that you've got all of Boston
worshipping at your feet,

15:26.695 --> 15:28.322
you're the new Blind Faith.

15:28.497 --> 15:29.623
I don't wanna be Blind Faith.

15:29.799 --> 15:31.790
I can never find sunglasses
that work with my face.

15:31.967 --> 15:35.368
And most importantly,
I just wanted Roxie to trust me.

15:35.538 --> 15:37.733
But you used magic
to make her trust you.

15:37.907 --> 15:41.138
That's not real trust, that's blind faith.

15:41.310 --> 15:42.641
Instead of arguing over semantics,

15:42.812 --> 15:45.246
how about you tell me
how to get people to stop trusting me?

15:45.414 --> 15:47.678
I mean,
short of running for political office.

15:47.850 --> 15:48.874
Mm, no clue.

15:49.051 --> 15:50.985
Here, you're going to need
my Seeing Eye dog.

15:51.153 --> 15:52.279
But that's a goat.

15:53.656 --> 15:55.248
Where are you going?
Don't disappear yet.

15:55.424 --> 15:58.257
I'm not going anywhere.
You're just losing your sight.

15:58.727 --> 16:00.092
That's better.

16:00.262 --> 16:03.754
Wow, ha, ha, this really is a goat.
Ha, ha.

16:04.533 --> 16:07.900
- These look terrible on me, don't they?
- Hmm.

16:09.071 --> 16:12.165
- Is anybody there?
Hi, Sabrina.

16:12.341 --> 16:15.777
Okay, everybody listen up.
This is very important, okay?

16:15.945 --> 16:18.971
Now, I need you all to trust me
when I say this:

16:19.148 --> 16:20.308
Don't trust me.

16:21.517 --> 16:23.382
I don't hear anybody leaving.

16:23.552 --> 16:25.577
We know you're just
testing our faith.

16:25.754 --> 16:28.222
No, I'm not, really. Trust me.

16:28.390 --> 16:30.722
We trust you, Sabrina.

16:30.893 --> 16:32.451
Okay, as long as we're clear on that.

16:32.628 --> 16:35.256
By the way, there's something
very strange going on in the kitchen.

16:35.431 --> 16:36.955
Of course there is.
Everybody hang here.

16:37.132 --> 16:38.724
Goat, take me to the kitchen.

16:38.901 --> 16:41.529
- Oh, wait, is my cat here?
- Nope.

16:41.704 --> 16:44.229
Figures, the one time
he might actually be useful.

16:47.776 --> 16:49.607
I understand
you have to soak your hip,

16:49.778 --> 16:52.144
but why do I need to be in here?

16:52.314 --> 16:55.715
Because this crummy tub
doesn't have any jets.

16:55.885 --> 16:57.352
Keep pedaling, Red.

17:01.123 --> 17:02.317
Whatever's going on in here,

17:02.491 --> 17:04.321
I'm warning you,
I'm armed with an attack goat.

17:04.492 --> 17:07.189
Don't worry, Sabrina,
everything's fine.

17:07.363 --> 17:10.025
- I took care of it for you.
- Thanks, Louisa.

17:10.199 --> 17:11.461
I thought maybe I'd come in here

17:11.634 --> 17:14.364
and find some of the Horsemen of
the Apocalypse defrosting my freezer.

17:15.738 --> 17:19.435
Nothing so dire.
Just a man with a summons.

17:19.608 --> 17:23.567
A summons? For me?
Why would I be getting a?

17:24.179 --> 17:26.739
...a summons?
Order in the court.

17:26.915 --> 17:30.443
Your Honor, sir, I think this has all
been a big misunderstanding.

17:30.619 --> 17:34.077
- Over here.
- Oh, sorry. Uh...

17:34.456 --> 17:37.823
If I'd been given any warning
about a magical systems check,

17:37.993 --> 17:40.291
I would have made sure
my roommates were out of the house.

17:40.462 --> 17:41.656
Do you swear to tell the truth,

17:41.830 --> 17:43.559
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth?

17:43.732 --> 17:45.393
What? Oh, yeah. I mean I do.

17:45.568 --> 17:48.162
Well, obviously you don't
or you wouldn't be here.

17:48.337 --> 17:50.771
Is this about the trust thing
and not about the house thing?

17:50.940 --> 17:51.964
It's hard to keep up.

17:52.141 --> 17:55.872
Why else would you be standing
before Naked Truth?

17:56.378 --> 17:57.572
No good reason comes to mind,

17:57.746 --> 18:00.943
and I don't suppose the "Naked" part
is just a metaphor?

18:01.116 --> 18:05.246
Nope, I'm completely open
and honest about everything.

18:05.421 --> 18:10.222
I have absolutely nothing to hide,
unlike some people.

18:10.392 --> 18:12.292
Well, of course I have things to hide.

18:12.461 --> 18:14.929
Of course I have to tell lies.
I live with mortals.

18:15.097 --> 18:18.089
And I gotta tell you, you're not helping
the trust factor, Your Nakedness.

18:18.267 --> 18:21.828
Trust is, as I like to say,
a two-way street.

18:22.004 --> 18:25.565
What reason does your friend Roxie
have to really trust you?

18:25.741 --> 18:28.710
In my defense,
she really, really trusts me now.

18:30.646 --> 18:32.477
I bet you're giving me a look, huh?

18:32.648 --> 18:35.116
All right, I guess she doesn't have
a reason to trust me.

18:35.284 --> 18:37.650
I guess she's always willing
to share her secrets with me,

18:37.820 --> 18:40.311
but I have gone the extra mile
not to share mine with her.

18:40.489 --> 18:42.753
Then I think you know
what you have to do.

18:42.925 --> 18:46.793
There's gotta be another way.
I mean, I can't just tell her I'm...

18:47.763 --> 18:49.526
- a witch.

18:49.898 --> 18:51.024
Hello?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.395
- Anybody?
- Hey, Sabrina.

18:53.569 --> 18:55.400
- Am I in the kitchen?
- Yes, you are.

18:55.571 --> 18:58.870
Do we have any Wasa crackers?
Little Sabrina is teething.

19:00.943 --> 19:02.410
Are you still sterilizing the mail?

19:02.578 --> 19:06.446
Uh, no, this is the warranty.
Yeah. It's good to keep it close.

19:06.615 --> 19:09.778
- Okay.
- No, wait, Roxie. That's a lie.

19:09.952 --> 19:12.079
Actually, most of the things
I tell you are lies.

19:12.254 --> 19:13.312
But you have to understand,

19:13.489 --> 19:15.650
it's because I didn't feel
like I have any other choice.

19:16.859 --> 19:20.420
The only way I can tell you my secret
is if I completely trust you.

19:20.596 --> 19:22.029
Don't you trust me?

19:22.731 --> 19:24.665
Yeah, I do.

19:25.100 --> 19:28.433
Roxie, I'm a witch.

19:29.004 --> 19:30.301
A witch?

19:33.442 --> 19:34.966
What am I doing here and?

19:36.278 --> 19:40.305
- Aah! I'm soaking in cat water.
- Ah!

19:41.650 --> 19:43.777
Yay! Ah, I can see again.

19:43.952 --> 19:47.080
A witch?
That's the weakest lie you've ever told.

19:47.690 --> 19:49.715
Roxie, wait.

19:51.326 --> 19:52.987
Don't walk away from me.
This is important.

19:53.162 --> 19:54.186
A witch, huh?

19:54.363 --> 19:56.331
Is that some kind of metaphor
for something?

19:56.498 --> 19:58.227
Yeah, maybe it is.

19:58.400 --> 20:01.927
It means a girl who's afraid of people
finding out who she really is.

20:02.104 --> 20:03.935
It means a girl
who's willing to hide the truth

20:04.106 --> 20:05.471
from those she loves the most.

20:05.641 --> 20:09.600
And it means a girl who feels different
and strange every moment of the day.

20:10.279 --> 20:13.771
Look, I wish I could share more things
with you, but sometimes I just can't.

20:13.949 --> 20:15.041
I'm sorry.

20:16.118 --> 20:20.248
Sabrina, I'm sorry too.
I think I've been a little unfair.

20:20.422 --> 20:23.084
Of course you have secrets.
We all do.

20:23.258 --> 20:25.522
Yeah, but you're a little better
about sharing yours.

20:25.694 --> 20:26.718
That's okay.

20:26.895 --> 20:28.886
I just have to trust
that when you feel comfortable,

20:29.064 --> 20:30.361
you'll share yours with me.

20:30.933 --> 20:33.493
I will. Thanks.

20:34.970 --> 20:37.200
A witch? That was pretty good.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.568
Salem! I'll get you.

20:41.744 --> 20:43.939
Have your lunch with me
in the bathtub.

20:44.113 --> 20:46.274
Come back here,
you mangy little fur ball.

20:47.015 --> 20:48.039
What's that all about?

20:48.217 --> 20:51.618
Oh, uh, you don't wanna know.
Trust me.

20:57.192 --> 20:59.422
Woo-hoo!
I passed my magical systems check.

21:05.901 --> 21:06.925
Hell hath no fury

21:07.102 --> 21:09.900
like a woman who's been tricked
into bathing with a cat.

21:10.072 --> 21:11.562
Where is that stupid cat?

21:12.941 --> 21:15.671
Quick, close the door.
You gotta help me.

21:15.844 --> 21:18.938
Don't worry,
I know exactly how to handle this.

21:19.915 --> 21:23.146
- Sabrina, have you seen Salem?
- Yeah, bottom cabinet on the right.
