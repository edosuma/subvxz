Things change, and you need
to change with them by 15%.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.184
but what makes him
good for us?

10:20.228 --> 10:22.230
Street's changed
since Hondo cut him.

10:22.273 --> 10:25.276
He seriously has.All right, well...

10:25.320 --> 10:29.672
if you're right,
might take a while,

10:29.716 --> 10:31.761
but you won't be
the only one to see it.

10:31.805 --> 10:32.936
What about in the meantime?

10:32.980 --> 10:35.417
That's my best free advice.

10:36.940 --> 10:38.942
Yeah.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.208
Brie, maybe he just forgot
where he parked it.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.341
Come on, we both know
he's got memory issues.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.343
No, no, don't do that,
don't do that.

10:48.386 --> 10:52.390
Look, if it's missing,
he's got to file a report.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.871
What are you talking about?
That's a terrible idea.

10:54.915 --> 10:57.047
Look, just don't let him
head out on his own.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.877
Okay, okay, fine, fine.
I get it, I get it.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.314
Brie, it's not your fault.
I'll take care of it.

11:03.358 --> 11:06.709
Brie, I said I'll handle it,
okay?

11:06.753 --> 11:08.493
[sighs]

11:08.537 --> 11:10.713
Black-and-whites
got their assignments?

11:10.757 --> 11:13.237
Yeah. Every juror's house
has a protection detail.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.848
We'll, uh, make the rounds,
fill in where needed.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.240
You want to head to
Petrosian's house,

11:16.284 --> 11:18.199
wait for that search
warrant to come down?

11:18.242 --> 11:19.722
Cortez says it might take
an hour or two.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.245
I got to make a pit stop.
There's a chance my pops

11:21.289 --> 11:22.246
might have gotten
his car stolen.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.857
We gonna go talk to him?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.207
[chuckles] If I can find him.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.471
You telling me I finally get
to meet Papa Harrelson?

11:29.514 --> 11:32.256
[chuckles] This could be
that magical day, Deac.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.955
Well, I'll try not
to embarrass you.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.479
Trust me, you're
not the problem.

11:48.969 --> 11:50.927
Well, this ain't
no coincidence.

11:50.971 --> 11:53.277
So Brie called you, huh?

11:53.321 --> 11:55.323
Now I got twocops
in the family.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.542
Way she watches me
just don't make no sense.

11:57.586 --> 12:00.937
Pop, let me introduce you to
Sergeant Kay. Deac, my old man.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.286
Daniel Harrelson.
David Kay.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.071
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.
Mm.

12:04.114 --> 12:06.203
Hondo hasn't told us much
about you, so... great to put

12:06.247 --> 12:08.031
a face to the name.HONDO: We're just waiting

12:08.075 --> 12:10.077
on a warrant.
What's up with you, man?

12:10.120 --> 12:11.469
You're the one that's rolling up
on your old man.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.471
What's up with you?Where's your car?

12:13.515 --> 12:16.126
I'm on my way
to get it back right now.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.301
Brianna told me it got stolen.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.955
You know who's got it?

12:18.999 --> 12:21.218
Bail bondsman... snatched it
out of my garage.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.264
That's private property, right?

12:23.307 --> 12:25.179
Sounds like.Okay, hold
up, hold up.

12:25.222 --> 12:27.311
What bail bondsman?Why don't we go together
and we bust him?

12:27.355 --> 12:29.574
As a matter of fact,
let's take your car.Hey, slow down. Slow down.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.576
Pop, you got arrested?
No.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.274
Remember Miss Williams?

12:33.317 --> 12:36.538
No, but knowing you,
I'm sure she's a looker.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.280
Yeah, well, she got a grandson.
His name is Andre.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.064
Now, he's the one
that got arrested.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.805
It was some bogus,
nothing charge.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.981
He was afraid he was gonna lose
his job if he didn't

12:45.025 --> 12:46.809
show up at work
'cause he was in the lock-up,

12:46.853 --> 12:48.245
so I bailed him out.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.856
And you put your car
up as collateral?

12:49.899 --> 12:52.380
What was the charge?Being black and poor. What else?

12:52.423 --> 12:54.034
Oh, here we go.

12:54.077 --> 12:57.167
Do you realize
that 70% of the people

12:57.211 --> 12:58.821
in this country that are in jail

12:58.865 --> 13:00.605
have never been
convicted of a crime?

13:00.649 --> 13:02.085
They just couldn't make bail.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.087
Seven-oh percent!

13:04.131 --> 13:06.524
Pop, you love that car.The boy was 19 years old, Hondo.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.831
And he was gonna take
a guilty plea for something

13:08.875 --> 13:11.921
that he didn't do, just so
that he would not lose his job.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.575
I mean, that's just wrong.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.533
I'm pretty sure there was a code
violation in there somewhere.

13:15.577 --> 13:18.623
Nobody should go to jail
for jaywalking.No, it's just a ticket.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.625
Something else had
to go down, man.Okay, so maybe

13:20.669 --> 13:23.280
he mouthed off at one of
the cops, and then that turns

13:23.324 --> 13:26.457
into resisting arrest.
Imagine that.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.111
So, what, the kid didn't
make it to his court day?

13:28.155 --> 13:29.504
The court date is a month away.

13:29.547 --> 13:31.332
But the bondsman--

13:31.375 --> 13:33.377
he wanted to make sure
that nothing happened

13:33.421 --> 13:35.902
with his collateral,
that it didn't get damaged,

13:35.945 --> 13:37.425
so he snatched my car.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.209
He's the one
that committed the crime.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.558
All right, look, we're gonna
take you home, all right?

13:40.602 --> 13:42.256
You think I can't
handle him by myself?

13:42.299 --> 13:45.041
I ain't never too old
for justice.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.260
Okay. Easy, tough guy.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.957
Just give me a name.

13:48.001 --> 13:50.307
Y'all gonna roll up on him?

13:50.351 --> 13:51.874
No, Pop. I'm gonna
talk to someone

13:51.918 --> 13:53.310
I know at the D.A.'s office.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.617
That's the belly
of the beast, son.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.924
It makes them people happy
to ruin people's entire lives

13:57.967 --> 13:59.490
just to make themselves
look good.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.927
Well, this one doesn't
believe in overcharging

14:00.970 --> 14:02.624
just because
she can. Come on.

14:02.667 --> 14:06.410
Well, if that's the case, she's
playing for the wrong side.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.109
Watch your head, Mr. Harrelson.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.938
I know how to do that.
Thank you very much.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.113
[chuckles softly]

14:15.245 --> 14:16.681
Okay.

14:16.725 --> 14:19.597
♪

14:19.641 --> 14:21.034
NIA:
These are new crimes.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.426
Judge, we're looking

14:22.470 --> 14:24.298
for any evidence of contact

14:24.341 --> 14:25.603
between Mr. Petrosian and
the suspect in custody.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.431
I understand that,

14:27.475 --> 14:29.433
but speculation doesn't qualify
as probable cause.

14:29.477 --> 14:31.087
What's your basis?

14:31.131 --> 14:33.437
Imminent danger, Your Honor.
Two arsonists...

14:33.481 --> 14:35.483
Hit men.
...are still
out there and active.

14:35.526 --> 14:36.484
While we're sitting
on our asses.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.920
You have the jurors' families

14:37.964 --> 14:39.443
under protection, correct?

14:39.487 --> 14:41.054
Yes, but that doesn't guarantee
their safety 100%, sir.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.664
This all looks

14:42.707 --> 14:46.276
more like reasonable suspicion
than probable cause.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.279
I'm worried about admissibility,
whatever you find.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.151
How about the risk of
bodily harm, Your Honor?

14:51.194 --> 14:53.327
I'm trying to save lives.

14:53.370 --> 14:54.676
You know last night's
victims, Judge.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.243
And you know the
next victims.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.461
If we don't
stop this.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.376
The rule of common
sense applies.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.943
Supported by your training

15:00.987 --> 15:03.163
and personal field experience,
Captain?

15:03.206 --> 15:05.382
Absolutely.

15:10.126 --> 15:12.041
Should've never released
the alternates.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.958
Good luck.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.655
Thank you.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.574
PETROSIAN:
My attorney advised me
to cooperate.

15:23.618 --> 15:25.620
Then you got your
money's worth.
Not really.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.144
He should be here.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.320
How are you allowed
to raid my house

15:30.364 --> 15:32.148
during the trial?Because this is

15:32.192 --> 15:34.498
about your next trial.DEACON: Murder for hire,

15:34.542 --> 15:36.109
arson murder,
multiple attempted murders...

15:36.152 --> 15:38.111
Busy night
last night.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.764
It wasn't my fault
what happened.Okay, then there won't be

15:39.808 --> 15:41.462
any evidence against you, so
what are you so worried about?

15:41.505 --> 15:43.072
Because I look guilty as hell!

15:43.116 --> 15:45.422
Three people from my trial?

15:45.466 --> 15:47.468
I never understood
why Andrea would

15:47.511 --> 15:49.035
lie about me like she did.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.037
I thought I was a
pretty good boss.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.213
But to die like that, in
front of her husband...

15:53.256 --> 15:54.431
DEACON:
We were there.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.520
I sat with him myself,

15:56.564 --> 15:59.001
waiting for the coroner
to move his wife's body.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.655
What was left of it.Coordinated attacks

16:00.698 --> 16:02.570
in different parts of town.
That's pro, not personal.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.615
Somebody is trying
to fix that jury for you,

16:04.659 --> 16:06.182
and don't you front
like you don't know who.

16:06.226 --> 16:07.575
I don't.The D.A. says

16:07.618 --> 16:09.533
she can charge you
with five separate

16:09.577 --> 16:12.188
special circumstances.Only takes one for
life without parole.

16:12.232 --> 16:13.537
And like is a long time
in San Quentin.

16:13.581 --> 16:17.193
You should really try
to help yourself.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.152
I am.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.592
Nice teamwork
last night.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.463
Is the guy we grabbed
willing to roll over

16:26.507 --> 16:27.856
about who threw the other
firebombs, who paid them?

16:27.899 --> 16:30.990
Not yet.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.165
Got a minute, Cap?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.080
Sure.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.386
A lot of chatter around here
about these budget cuts.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.736
Possiblecuts.
It's all gossip at this point.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.304
I'm hearing there's a list of
names already, to move off SWAT,

16:41.348 --> 16:43.132
back to patrol, put more
faces on the street

16:43.176 --> 16:45.743
where the taxpayers
can see them?No, that's not true.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.310
I'm hearing my
name's on the list.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.746
There's no list.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.445
You'd tell me if
there was, right?

16:51.488 --> 16:53.099
I promise, there's no list.

16:58.191 --> 17:00.149
How'd the budget meeting go?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.369
At least we looked good
on the 11:00 news.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.675
Always helps negotiations
with City Hall.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.113
Would've been a disaster
if that suspect had escaped.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.115
Status?

17:09.158 --> 17:11.160
RHD's going through evidence
from the search this morning.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.596
The jury's been transported
from the hotel.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.163
Unis are protecting
the families,

17:14.207 --> 17:17.210
and we're protecting the unis.Watch the overtime.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.689
I didn't have a choice
last night, sir.I know.

17:18.733 --> 17:20.039
It wasn't a criticism.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.259
We already have
a morale problem.

17:23.303 --> 17:25.653
Officers think they're gonna
get bumped off SWAT

17:25.696 --> 17:27.698
and sent down to patrol.

17:27.742 --> 17:30.353
I even heard a crazy rumor
that there's a list of names

17:30.397 --> 17:32.703
for reassignment.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.750
Which there isn't, right?

17:40.233 --> 17:42.191
There's a list.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.410
Nothing's final.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.281
When were you gonna tell me?

17:45.325 --> 17:46.717
You got enough hate

17:46.761 --> 17:48.371
from pushing those proposals
through last year.

17:48.415 --> 17:51.722
I could've given you better
support, I know that.

17:51.766 --> 17:54.551
So now I was just trying to
insulate you as long as I could.

17:54.595 --> 17:57.119
I thought we'd be able
to negotiate our way out of it.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.165
They want more cops
on the streets,

17:59.208 --> 18:01.689
from wherever they
harvest them, including us.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.778
Deputy chief's
rolling over.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.085
So this is real?

18:06.128 --> 18:08.087
I hate politics.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.134
So the juror's wife went
to stay with her mom?

18:12.178 --> 18:13.483
You blame her?
I wouldn't hang around

18:13.527 --> 18:15.355
waiting to get burned out.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.488
She packed her bag as soon
as she heard why we're here.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.404
On your six.

I was wrong.

as good as you are.

and focus on the job,

35:33.827 --> 35:35.916

which car you stole last night?

35:50.844 --> 35:54.543
When I hold the pink slip,
I own the car, sir.

35:54.587 --> 35:57.546
I moved my car out of
your garage. That's not theft.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.374
In whose world?HONDO:
All right, listen here.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.724
I'm gonna give you
my credit card for your fee.

36:01.768 --> 36:04.379
Then you give my father his car
and his pink slip.

36:04.423 --> 36:05.554
It's not that simple.Why not?

36:05.598 --> 36:07.817
Car wasn't worth
as much as I thought.

in cherry condition.

around the odometer?

36:12.735 --> 36:14.911
At least one more
than you swore and signed.

36:14.955 --> 36:16.826
Okay, hold up, hold up, Pop.You hear what he's
trying to do, son.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.915
He trying to keep my car.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.308
I don't have your car!

36:20.352 --> 36:22.267
I sold it to cover my fee.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.920
You owed me
the money, sir.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.748
I am gonna refund you
the difference.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.576
That's what I was checking
on the computer.

36:27.620 --> 36:29.839
You didn't call me and tell me
you were selling my car.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.841
Blue Book's $700.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.933
I ain't done with you!

36:36.977 --> 36:38.239
Have a good evening.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.762
Pops, stop.
You're a hothead.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.982
Yeah, well, it used
to run in the family.

36:42.025 --> 36:44.332
Look, the new owners have had
your car for less than a day.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.291
We're gonna buy it back.How we gonna find it?

36:48.380 --> 36:50.251
I installed a tracker.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.297
When?

36:54.473 --> 36:56.649
So that you and Brie
could spy on me?

36:58.999 --> 37:00.957
That's just shameful, son.

37:04.047 --> 37:06.485
It means we can
find your car, Pop.

for nothing.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.821

37:48.135 --> 37:50.572
Peter?

37:50.616 --> 37:52.357
I'll call you tomorrow.

37:53.706 --> 37:55.403
You don't have to.

37:55.447 --> 37:57.318
I know.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.893

38:12.594 --> 38:13.900
You think it's in there?

38:15.684 --> 38:17.947
Signal don't lie, Pop.

38:19.514 --> 38:22.300
When I first got that car,
I showed it to your Mom.

38:22.343 --> 38:23.779
Man, she was red hot.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.781
Yeah, she was
because you broke her budget.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.698
We could drive that car
anywhere.

38:29.742 --> 38:32.353
Any part of town,
and we were always in style.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.616
We could even drive it
to the Westside,

38:34.660 --> 38:36.575
which we sometimes
called "the white side."

38:36.618 --> 38:38.403
[chuckles]

38:38.446 --> 38:40.187
But people would look
at you like...

38:40.230 --> 38:42.320
like you were somebody,
you know what I mean?
Mm-hmm.

38:42.363 --> 38:45.279
And your mom-- she loved it.What are you talking about?
She hated that car.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.280
Really?
Yeah.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.673
Did she ever mention to you

38:47.716 --> 38:49.370
that your life started
in the back seat of that car?

38:49.414 --> 38:52.286
Okay, whoa,
whoa. What?!
[chuckles]

38:52.330 --> 38:54.114
Yeah. Well, when we got married,

38:54.157 --> 38:56.290
we were still living
with her folks,

38:56.334 --> 38:58.466
and sometimes that car was
the only privacy that we had.

38:58.510 --> 39:00.468
Okay, I'm really not trying
to hear this right now.

39:00.512 --> 39:02.296
A lot of good memories
in the back seat.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.429
Oh, come on, Pops.
Stop, man. Stop.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.474
What I'm trying
to tell you, son, is,

39:06.518 --> 39:08.215
it's more than just a car to me.

39:08.258 --> 39:10.348
Okay, and I got that,
but are we done?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.262

Hey.

39:18.791 --> 39:21.228
Hmm?
Here comes your seller.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.317
What if he refuses?

39:28.366 --> 39:30.759
He kept the car
for himself.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.293
You gentlemen know

39:43.337 --> 39:45.470
stalking's a crime, don't you?

39:45.513 --> 39:47.472
How about fraud?

39:47.515 --> 39:50.605
Why didn't you tell me
you were a cop before?

39:50.649 --> 39:52.651
Because I was off-duty,

39:52.694 --> 39:54.740
and I don't use my badge
to ask for any favors.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.698
Now might be a good time
for you to start

39:56.742 --> 39:58.352
to repent for your actions,
partner.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.485
See my boy here--
he's a SWAT team leader.

40:02.922 --> 40:04.706
There's been
a misunderstanding here.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.316
So, why don't we
rectify that?

40:06.360 --> 40:08.449
I think you said a fair price
for my father's car

40:08.493 --> 40:10.408
was $700 over
your fee.

40:11.626 --> 40:13.585
That's $700.

40:13.628 --> 40:15.587
You want to count it?

40:15.630 --> 40:18.720
No need.Where's the pink slip?

40:18.764 --> 40:20.940
Glove compartment.You better not have
damaged my starter

40:20.983 --> 40:22.376
when you hotwired my car.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.726
[chuckles softly]

40:24.770 --> 40:27.033
My father will
take his car now.

40:30.776 --> 40:33.343
Thank you, son.

40:40.699 --> 40:43.484
I'll follow you home, Pop.No, won't be
no need for that.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.877
It's just a waste of gas.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.487
Besides, ain't you got
nothing better to do?

40:46.531 --> 40:48.663
Don't worry about it.
It's still early.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.059
[car door closes,
engine starts]

40:57.716 --> 40:59.674
Hey.

40:59.718 --> 41:01.502
No rolling stops, you hear me?

41:01.546 --> 41:03.983
I have no idea
what you talking about.
