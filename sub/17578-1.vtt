00:53.640 --> 00:56.473
Shit. There's an immobilizer.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.353
Someone doesn't want us to leave.

00:58.440 --> 00:59.759
Oh, man.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.110
I've got a bad feeling about this.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.007
You're not going to
believe this shit.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.159
- They've got one in my truck too.
- Well, now what?

01:09.440 --> 01:13.399
What now is,
we wait for bravo unit,

01:14.800 --> 01:16.597
then we all walk out
of here together.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.675
Victor! Victor! Victor!

01:49.960 --> 01:51.279
It's not gonna work.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.310
Don't sweat it.
Stay sharp, fellas.

02:01.280 --> 02:02.679
Contact, ten o'clock!

02:02.960 --> 02:04.313
Victor! Victor! Victor!

02:04.440 --> 02:06.158
Hold your fire!

02:08.360 --> 02:11.238
Calm down. What's going on
out there? What's the damage?

02:11.320 --> 02:13.754
We got hit hard.
There are no other survivors.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.354
Okay. Continue on to base,

02:16.440 --> 02:18.078
find Chernov
and tell her what's happened.

02:18.240 --> 02:19.468
Get back-up. Got it?

02:19.840 --> 02:21.319
- We got slaughtered.
- Got it!?

02:21.680 --> 02:23.432
- Yes, sir.
- Get moving!

02:27.440 --> 02:30.637
Hit the lights!
Position around the humvee.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.719
Fire!

03:05.040 --> 03:07.474
Cease fire! Cease fire!

03:40.720 --> 03:44.030
Is that it!
Is that all you've got!?

04:42.960 --> 04:44.279
Chernov!

04:45.320 --> 04:47.515
Chernov! We need help!

04:48.240 --> 04:49.468
Chernov!

05:04.760 --> 05:06.637
That was the last one, Dr. Krieger.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.312
Outstanding.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.553
Absolutely outstanding.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.311
Where are the whales, Jack?

05:51.640 --> 05:54.074
This is a whale
watching tour, right?

05:54.160 --> 05:56.151
Well that's funny,
because we scheduled them

05:56.240 --> 05:59.391
to breach over our
boat exactly at 2:45 and...

05:59.520 --> 06:02.478
You promised me whales,
George.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.795
You hear that?
You go get us some whales

06:05.880 --> 06:07.359
or you get us our money back.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.353
I told you, we don't guarantee
you see any whales.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.754
You get your three hours out

06:11.840 --> 06:13.671
like everyone else
and take your chances.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.677
Oh, we're staying out here until
we see some whales.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.079
You might be,

06:17.200 --> 06:18.872
but this boat's going
to be back in the harbor...

06:18.960 --> 06:20.552
at the three hour mark exactly.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.076
What's that accent?
You're German, right?

06:24.320 --> 06:28.199
Well let me tell you something
about American customer service.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.279
We're staying out.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.673
Okay.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.672
Can you come over here?

06:38.080 --> 06:39.957
Can you hold on to this for a sec?

06:44.040 --> 06:45.393
Where are you going?

06:46.880 --> 06:48.359
Anybody want some beer?

06:53.760 --> 06:56.433
George,
what are you doing driving?

06:56.640 --> 06:57.675
What?

07:02.600 --> 07:06.752
Hey, and watch out for those rocks.
They're pretty sharp and big.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.679
We're alright, Jack.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.514
Take us back.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.200
But, George,
what about the whales?

07:19.320 --> 07:21.151
You wanna see a damn whale,
you drive the boat

07:22.720 --> 07:25.314
- George.
- This was your idea.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.752
This was not my idea.
You blame everything on me.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.512
You're the one who bought all
that picture-book stuff

07:31.640 --> 07:34.234
with whales on it for Christmas.
You gave it to me,

07:34.320 --> 07:35.435
but you wanted it for yourself...

07:35.520 --> 07:37.238
You blame everything on me.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.548
- You couldn't stop...
- You're the one who made us...

07:38.680 --> 07:40.830
- talking about the whales.
- sign up for Greenpeace.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.719
Chernov.

08:00.320 --> 08:03.630
- Good work last night, Katia.
- Thank you, doctor.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.712
And they were some
of your best men.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.514
The best money can buy.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.993
Doctor,

08:11.080 --> 08:12.559
why wasn't I informed about
the maneuvers...

08:12.680 --> 08:13.954
outside the perimeter?

08:14.560 --> 08:16.357
Because it was part of research.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.472
Anything that takes place
outside on this island

08:19.600 --> 08:21.716
is a security matter
that concerns me.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.956
Captain,
I didn't want to trouble you.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.671
I knew how you
would feel about testing.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.719
Testing?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.197
Yes.
Our subject engaged live targets.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.597
You mean you tested him
on my men.

08:37.919 --> 08:41.390
One unarmed,
genetically modified soldier

08:41.600 --> 08:44.239
eliminated ten
heavy-armed men.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.799
This is, um...

08:49.120 --> 08:52.192
This is way beyond anything
the command would authorize.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.551
Captain,
they're not even your men.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.672
They're Chernov's people.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.359
All of those genetically
modified soldiers,

09:02.480 --> 09:04.596
or whatever you want
to call those creatures,

09:05.480 --> 09:07.471
were all once human.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.751
Yes, that's right.

09:11.160 --> 09:13.754
Now, if you would excuse me,

09:14.040 --> 09:15.996
I have to finish my painting.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.678
Chernov,
is he back in his holding pen?

09:31.040 --> 09:33.474
Yes. The time-released tranquilizer
worked perfectly.

09:33.560 --> 09:37.439
Good. You know, if Parker wants
to get that much involved,

09:37.800 --> 09:41.998
why don't you have him and
his men clean up all the mess?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.194
I'm not sure how much more
of this I can stomach.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.990
You mean having that hard bitch
as your boss?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.558
You know well enough
what I mean.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.632
Yeah, well I have my orders,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.513
but you have a choice, Max.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.638
Why don't you just leave?

09:59.720 --> 10:03.156
I keep thinking I can do more
good by staying. We'll see.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.396
Not much of a killer instinct
for a soldier.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.034
Yeah, well maybe he'll send you
out there next time.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.350
Don't you think
it's a little far-fetched

10:17.480 --> 10:20.756
- genetically modified soldiers?
- I've got it from a good source.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.433
Nice.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.600
You know, it looks like something
from your sasquatch file.

10:27.720 --> 10:28.948
Very funny.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.231
It's a surveillance photo taken
outside Krieger's research facility.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.631
I don't need to tell you
how much trouble you can...

10:34.720 --> 10:37.280
get into snooping around
military affairs, do I?

10:37.480 --> 10:39.789
That's just the thing. All my
usual sources say there's no...

10:39.880 --> 10:41.996
official military installation
on that island.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.192
This is from another source.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.551
Gorgeous shot of a lumber mill.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.434
Who are these guys?

10:51.080 --> 10:52.035
Okay,

10:52.400 --> 10:54.470
so maybe it's super covert.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.188
That's all the more reason not
to go snooping around.

10:57.320 --> 10:58.958
Paul, Krieger has been known

10:59.040 --> 11:00.678
to perform genetic experiments
on humans.

11:00.880 --> 11:03.348
Now he resurfaces on an island
secured by soldiers.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.439
Valerie, I trust your intuition,

11:06.520 --> 11:08.272
but I am not going to have you
follow up on this lead.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.628
Do you understand?

11:10.720 --> 11:12.631
Fine, I'll do it on my own time.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.553
What time? You work
fourteen hours a day on this paper.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.153
I'll take some vacation then

11:17.800 --> 11:19.711
You? Vacation?

11:19.800 --> 11:21.597
I must have a few
weeks banked, right?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.034
Why are you so determined
to follow this lead?

11:25.120 --> 11:27.111
Because it's too good
of a story to pass up.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.029
Paul.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.991
Besides,
I've got a personal interest.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.959
General.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.878
- General.
- Doctor.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.996
I'm assuming you've got
something interesting to show me.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.549
See for yourself. Parker.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.638
Please.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.754
Please.

12:33.000 --> 12:36.595
As you can see, General,
your money was put to good use.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.513
Doctor, I couldn't care
about fancy facilities.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.035
What I care about is your results.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.593
I'm positive
that you'll be satisfied.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.073
We'll see about that.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.438
See for yourself.

12:57.160 --> 12:58.639
He looks fit.

13:00.600 --> 13:04.115
We have ten holding cells.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.110
And now I have to show you
something really incredible.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.315
Here's one we took the liberty
of field testing ourselves.

13:21.280 --> 13:22.599
Chernov,

13:22.720 --> 13:24.312
the gun.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.748
- Shoot him.
- Shoot him?

13:29.880 --> 13:32.235
Yes, but be careful.
Not in the eyes...

13:32.320 --> 13:33.753
and not in the mouth.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.039
- Subcutaneous armor?
- The skin itself,

13:51.160 --> 13:54.232
twenty times more resistant
to puncture than Kevlar.

13:54.320 --> 13:58.677
His muscles absorb the blows
and protect his organs.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.709
Let him loose.
Let's see how he moves.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.473
I cannot do that
without sedating him.

14:04.600 --> 14:07.273
He would kill everybody
in this room including me.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.958
Are you saying
that you can't control him?

14:09.080 --> 14:11.469
I can control him,
but I have to work on his?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.114
What good is that,
a weapon that we can't control?

14:14.240 --> 14:16.708
You can use him under certain
circumstances for...

14:16.800 --> 14:19.553
That's not what we commissioned
from you, doctor.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.108
You asked me to create
an invincible soldier.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.191
That's what I'm presenting
to you today.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.878
Basically bulletproof,

14:26.320 --> 14:27.878
no need for sleep,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.470
and he can fight harder and longer
than any human soldier.

14:31.560 --> 14:36.475
A soldier? You're making
brainless monsters!

14:44.760 --> 14:46.352
Sedate him!

14:47.360 --> 14:48.634
More!

14:54.520 --> 14:58.069
If he can't take orders then he's
no better than a vicious animal.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.033
But some more time

15:00.160 --> 15:02.230
- and some more money.
- No more funding...

15:02.320 --> 15:04.356
until you produce something
that we can use.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.593
Chernov.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.319
Working late, Max?

15:35.320 --> 15:36.673
Hey, Uncle Max, it's me.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.279
I thought I'd leave you
a voice mail

15:38.360 --> 15:40.316
just in case you were
picking up your messages.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.550
I responded to your last email,
but I never heard anything back.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.908
I just wanted to check...

15:44.040 --> 15:47.237
if we were still meeting
at that spot that you sent me.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.199
Anyway, I'm heading up now,
so I'll see you soon.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.230
Hi, this is...
Valerie Cardinal calling.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.436
I'm calling to confirm that
you were able to get that...

16:02.560 --> 16:04.994
boat captain that
I requested... Jack Carver.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.033
That's right.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.548
Terrific.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.278
I'll be up there in a few hours.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.277
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.473
- Ralph,
- What?

16:14.560 --> 16:17.518
you made sure to tell jack
about the client today, right?

16:17.600 --> 16:19.591
- He knows.
- He should be on the dock,

16:19.680 --> 16:21.557
fueling up and preparing by now.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.720
I thought I saw him going
in to the Golden Spruce last night.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.036
That wouldn't be too unlike him.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.238
Well his boat is just sitting
out over there.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.356
Do you see him on deck?

16:34.240 --> 16:35.229
No, pet, I don't.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.629
Which means he's probably
sleeping it off.

16:37.720 --> 16:38.789
He could be.

16:39.120 --> 16:40.633
Well, aren't you going
to go get him up?

16:40.720 --> 16:41.994
Hey, look, he'll be here.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.190
I'm not going to have a captain
represent us,

16:44.280 --> 16:46.840
showing up unshaven
and hung over for a client!

16:46.920 --> 16:48.069
Get him up!

16:48.200 --> 16:49.633
Yes, Pet.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.598
Medusa, Medusa,
this is Day Beacon, over.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.355
Medusa, Medusa, wakey-wakey.
This is Day Beacon, over.

17:07.520 --> 17:09.112
Shit.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.159
Turn his head.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.038
Slowly, slowly.

18:13.480 --> 18:15.152
Max,

18:16.280 --> 18:18.271
can you hear me?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.710
- Camera's working.
- Yes, sir, it is.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.548
Max,

18:27.040 --> 18:29.474
can you hear me?

18:32.040 --> 18:33.473
Light.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.192
Max,

18:40.680 --> 18:42.398
what color?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.038
Red.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.759
Perfect.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.478
And now?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.719
- Green.
- Perfect. Perfect.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.558
Take the light.

18:58.440 --> 19:01.591
Max. Max, I think
you're going to earn us...

19:01.720 --> 19:03.631
the rest of our funding.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.079
Good, good, good, good.

19:07.360 --> 19:09.430
- Stitch him up.
- Yes, doctor.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.272
She'll be here soon.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.714
Maybe you should take
the skiff out and check in on him.

19:22.520 --> 19:25.273
You know he doesn't like
people dropping in on him.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.356
Ralph, you're his boss.

19:27.480 --> 19:29.516
Well, technically,
he's a contractor.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.831
What? Are you scared of him?

19:31.960 --> 19:35.475
Pet, you've heard all the stories.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.795
That's all they are, stories.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.110
Special army my ass.
He's a drunk.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.270
Just because he drinks
doesn't mean he's a drunk.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.710
It's special forces, pet,
not special army.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.114
Whatever.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.955
If you're not going to do anything,
I will. I'm gonna go get my gun.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.238
Menopause.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.273
Reload.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.109
I don't think you should be
playing with him like this Pat.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.276
Well, if he's as tough
as you all think...

20:36.360 --> 20:38.316
he is he should be able to handle
a little shooting.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.118
Someone could get hurt.

20:40.240 --> 20:44.392
I mean you could take out
an eye or something.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.275
Special army my ass.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.195
Hi. Is this...
Day Beacon Boat Charters?

20:58.320 --> 21:02.154
- Yes it is and you must be Valerie.
- Hi.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.073
Hi. I hope I won't be needing one
of those where I'm going.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.032
Hey, we've got some
paperwork to do. Come on in.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.959
Keep flipping those, will ya?

21:54.440 --> 21:58.035
I didn't realize the tour
came with a meal.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.719
We head straight
back after lunch.

22:01.400 --> 22:03.152
How much to charter
your boat for the night?

22:03.280 --> 22:06.272
For the night?
We are not that kind of operation.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.351
You chartered me for six hours,
okay?

22:09.160 --> 22:10.513
Jack, did you serve in Germany

22:10.640 --> 22:12.710
with a man by the name
of Max Cardinal?

22:16.040 --> 22:19.237
- Who said I was in the services?
- Max is my uncle.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.439
Very sorry, but I don't know
anybody by that name.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.679
He said he was really glad to run
into you after he came out here.

22:26.800 --> 22:31.032
Did he? I really don't know
the guy you're talking about.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.232
Tischtennis.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.519
What?

22:35.640 --> 22:37.949
Tischtennis.
That was your safe word.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.158
So you're his niece, huh?

22:41.720 --> 22:43.756
That would make you
the hotshot reporter.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.276
I prefer journalist.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.039
Right.
What brings you out here?

22:49.120 --> 22:50.553
I'm meeting with Max.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.756
- Where, on that island?
- Yeah.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.270
That island's off limits
to the public.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.954
Everyone around here knows
to stay well away from it.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.195
They're expecting me.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.629
Right. That's why you
chartered your own boat

23:02.760 --> 23:04.398
for a little night landing, huh?

23:04.520 --> 23:06.351
It's a personal visit.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.080
- Are you going to take me or not?
- No I won't.

23:12.360 --> 23:14.112
Max would understand why.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.798
Did Max tell you what
they're doing over there?

23:15.920 --> 23:18.354
- No.
- You're not curious?

23:18.640 --> 23:21.154
I'm curious how that fish
is going to turn out.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.550
It's almost done.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.112
I think Max might be in trouble.

23:27.240 --> 23:30.038
That man is perfectly capable
of taking care of himself.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.633
He set up this meeting.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.280
He sent me a message and
I haven't heard from him since.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.874
He found out that his client...

23:37.000 --> 23:38.718
was doing something
that he didn't like.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.396
Your uncle doesn't like things,
he'd quit.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.198
I asked him to stay on.

23:44.560 --> 23:46.710
You're writing a little story, huh?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.591
That money will buy you
a ride exactly...

23:59.720 --> 24:01.517
to the island and back.
That's it.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.708
So much for camaraderie
between soldiers.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.238
Hey, your fish is cooked.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.392
Let's see.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.991
This is burnt.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.954
- They're crispy.
- Crispy?

25:09.160 --> 25:10.479
No sign of anyone.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.758
Max wanted me to meet him up
on the landing, in the woods.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.117
Why didn't he want
to meet you up on the pier?

25:16.320 --> 25:19.073
I don't know. Like I said,

25:19.200 --> 25:21.156
all I got was the last message.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.593
Wanna come with me?

25:24.720 --> 25:28.679
No. I can take you to the shore,
but that's about it.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.000
- Okay.
- You sure you wanna go?

25:32.320 --> 25:35.278
Yeah. Max is waiting for me.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.678
Fine.

25:45.360 --> 25:48.477
- I can take you back.
- No. Let's go.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.388
Here, take this.

27:00.040 --> 27:03.077
- Thank you.
- I'm giving you exactly six hours.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.991
You better be
here when I get back.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.270
You better be
here when I get back.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.072
Max?

27:36.520 --> 27:38.158
Max?

27:40.200 --> 27:41.633
Max?

27:46.200 --> 27:49.476
Miss Cardinal,
welcome to the party.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.108
Let's go.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.753
- Get rid of the boat.
- My pleasure.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.078
You're late.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.638
Check her body.

28:54.680 --> 28:57.478
I hope you didn't leave anything
important on that boat.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.077
You just killed a man.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.276
I'd be more concerned
about yourself.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.720
- What have you done with Max?
- You'll see soon enough.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.636
I don't know why we're bothering.
The guy's dead. Bitch.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.390
You go that way.
I'll check over here.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.469
- Chernov.
- Doctor I have her.

29:42.800 --> 29:43.949
Good.

29:44.080 --> 29:47.197
I'm checking for survivors. I'll be
back with the reporter shortly.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.952
Russell.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.268
Russell.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.472
Where are those guys?

30:48.880 --> 30:50.552
Check the wood line, nine o'clock.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.712
- Yes sir. Go.
- Move! Move! / clear.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.551
We've lost contact
with Russell and Kyle.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.996
- Send a backup team.
- 10-4. Backup team on the way.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.037
Go after them!

31:36.640 --> 31:39.950
- Go! Go!
- Go!

31:43.760 --> 31:46.115
Go! Go! Go! Here we up.

31:46.280 --> 31:48.874
- I'm handcuffed.
- Wait a second.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.640
- Universal handcuff key.
- Where'd you get that?

31:52.960 --> 31:55.474
Never leave home without one.
Turn around.

31:59.720 --> 32:02.393
- Uh-oh. Here they come.
- Stop them.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.951
- Here, do it yourself.
- Great. Thanks.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.274
Are you okay?

32:14.320 --> 32:16.356
- Okay.
- I'm great.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.278
Come on.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.513
Let's go.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.033
Got it!

33:13.560 --> 33:15.118
Holy shit!

33:16.080 --> 33:18.310
- How about pitching in a little?
- I'm trying.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.551
Try harder, please.

33:42.560 --> 33:43.754
More help?

33:47.840 --> 33:49.637
- What are these?
- Well that's sweet.

33:49.960 --> 33:52.110
It's called a hand grenade.
Try throwing one.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.477
- It didn't work.
- Did you pull the pin?

33:59.960 --> 34:01.678
They're useless with the pin.

34:05.320 --> 34:06.753
Hurry up!

34:10.719 --> 34:13.280
- Did you throw it?
- Uh, yeah.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.150
Wooo! Yeah.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.396
- What's happening?
- Oh no.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.150
Please tell me you have something
else back there.

34:38.239 --> 34:39.389
I'm trying.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.349
Hey, what's this thing?

34:51.920 --> 34:54.559
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

34:54.679 --> 34:56.159
What do you mean
you don't know?

34:57.320 --> 34:58.469
Look out!

35:07.560 --> 35:09.278
You've gotta be kidding me.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.031
Come on. Come on.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.313
Start the search.
I want confirmation they're dead.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.230
Let's go inside.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.672
Are you hurt?

37:31.480 --> 37:32.629
You've been shot.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.592
That's just a scratch.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.673
You better get out
of those wet clothes.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.679
Okay.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.272
Turn around.

38:32.280 --> 38:35.192
Okay,
you can turn around now.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.274
Thanks.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.710
I told you Max is in trouble.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.398
It's my fault he stayed though.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.395
I convinced him I could take
the story public.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.272
It was his decision to stay.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.628
What do we do now?

38:54.160 --> 38:56.958
That's easy.
Get off this island.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.715
I told you, I'm not leaving
without finding Max.

39:01.360 --> 39:04.511
You can get us into the mill
to look for him

39:04.640 --> 39:07.632
No. You hired me
as a water captain.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.109
Shore excursions aren't
part of the deal.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.636
Don't you ever think
about anybody...

39:12.720 --> 39:14.472
except yourself and money.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.678
Did I mention you owe me a boat.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.318
Oh, it's cold.

39:29.640 --> 39:31.517
I think I'm getting hypothermia.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.958
Can I come in?

39:39.560 --> 39:41.039
Okay.

39:41.160 --> 39:46.314
Good. I have to take off
my wet pants, you know.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.559
Turn around.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.234
This bed's very uncomfortable,

40:20.360 --> 40:23.636
- itchy.
- Sorry, the Hyatt was booked out.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.473
- It's cold.
- Yeah.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.430
You know what we used
to do in the military?

40:42.560 --> 40:44.596
No. What?

40:46.240 --> 40:50.950
It was called shared body heat.

40:54.120 --> 40:55.439
like spooning?

40:56.960 --> 41:00.589
- You could say so.
- Okay.

41:13.600 --> 41:15.955
Much better.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.359
Is that your gun.

41:24.280 --> 41:28.432
Well I never
go to bed without it.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.673
Gone.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.078
So, how was I?

41:56.120 --> 41:57.394
Where are we headed?

41:58.720 --> 42:00.915
There's a dock by the mill
on the other side of the island.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.189
We're going to grab a boat there.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.992
I told you,
I'm not leaving without Max.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.559
Don't start again.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.830
We're going to get a boat
and leave this island.

42:12.040 --> 42:13.473
You didn't answer my question.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.315
What do you mean?

42:15.640 --> 42:16.755
What do I mean?

42:17.400 --> 42:19.868
On a scale from one to ten,
how would you rate me?

42:24.160 --> 42:25.115
Two.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.755
Two? A two?

42:28.080 --> 42:29.274
What?

42:36.040 --> 42:37.473
Am I seeing this?

42:42.360 --> 42:43.759
I'm gonna check it out.

42:54.280 --> 42:55.508
Get your hands up.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.039
Get 'em up.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.519
You're coming back
to base camp.

43:16.600 --> 43:17.999
Undress.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.514
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to her.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.560
You wish, huh? I was kidding.

43:40.640 --> 43:41.959
Keep going.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.312
I was really only a two.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.678
Okay, a three.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.433
Hat.

44:17.640 --> 44:19.471
Yes sir.

44:21.560 --> 44:23.278
Parker,
we need two of your trucks.

44:23.520 --> 44:26.512
Yeah? Well I heard
what happened last night.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.149
Why don't you leave
island security to us

44:29.240 --> 44:31.356
and you just stick
to what you're good at,

44:31.680 --> 44:34.478
- whatever that is.
- Just give me those trucks.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.755
- I need a word with you.
- Oh.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.435
Being cannon fodder for mutants
was never part of the deal

44:40.560 --> 44:42.232
and there have been
a lot of us dying lately.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.438
We compensate you well enough,

44:44.760 --> 44:46.671
so you'll whatever
we tell you to do.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.236
And if we're dead,
you won't have to pay us at all.

44:50.600 --> 44:51.874
You don't like it you can leave.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.195
Yeah? Well I'll take
what I know with me.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.276
You'll be sorry for this.

45:08.720 --> 45:10.312
Anymore complaints?

46:21.760 --> 46:23.273
Come on. It's clear.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.636
- Oww.
- You're my prisoner.

46:54.280 --> 46:56.157
Okay. Inside.

46:59.440 --> 47:01.317
You wait here
and I'll get us a boat.

47:01.440 --> 47:02.714
I told you, I'm not going.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.468
Your ride is leaving now, whether
you're on it or not.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.028
I mean it.

47:07.200 --> 47:08.428
Not without Max.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.393
I'm going to bring the boat here

47:11.480 --> 47:13.152
and you better be
here when I'm back.

47:15.360 --> 47:17.396
You better be
here when I'm back.

47:39.640 --> 47:40.993
Dr. Krieger,

47:41.080 --> 47:42.354
you might want to see this.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.079
Look at this.

47:51.520 --> 47:52.999
Is that her?

47:53.400 --> 47:54.674
Yes.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.158
I thought she was dead.

47:58.440 --> 48:00.670
- She soon will be.
- Chernov,

48:01.880 --> 48:03.438
I want to speak to her.

48:03.800 --> 48:05.472
Yes, sir.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.319
Up.

48:34.520 --> 48:36.556
Take her to the cell
until the doctor's ready.

48:41.760 --> 48:44.433
Why couldn't they load
this up on the main dock,

48:44.520 --> 48:47.478
huh? Tell me that. Then we
could have used the forklift.

48:47.800 --> 48:51.076
Now we have to hump
all these ourselves.

48:51.160 --> 48:52.559
This is ridiculous!

48:54.760 --> 48:56.398
Oh, my back.

48:56.720 --> 49:00.508
Oh, my back.
I think I compressed a disc.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.039
Forget this.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.353
I'm taking a break.

49:06.320 --> 49:11.997
Oh. Oh.

49:13.640 --> 49:15.631
I wouldn't be sitting down
if I were you.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.517
You don't want the commandant
to catch you. Come on.

49:17.800 --> 49:22.032
What the hell do I care?
Because of that tight-ass?

49:22.160 --> 49:25.357
- What, am I a soldier?
- No!

49:25.680 --> 49:28.114
- Whatever, man.
- Whatever, man.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.117
Oh, shit.

49:42.520 --> 49:48.390
I've been thinking about
you all day, all day.

49:54.040 --> 49:55.598
That's good.

50:03.560 --> 50:05.232
Okay?

50:05.600 --> 50:08.034
Okay? Okay?

50:18.760 --> 50:21.479
Oh, my back! Oh, my back! Oh.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.359
I was a goner.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.318
Oh my god. You saved my life!
You saved my life!

50:27.440 --> 50:29.829
- Oh my god. I was...
- It's okay.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.196
Who the hell are you anyway?

50:31.280 --> 50:32.998
What are you doing sneaking up
on me like that?

50:33.080 --> 50:36.038
Hey! What are you two doing?

50:38.520 --> 50:39.555
Who are you?

50:40.640 --> 50:42.756
Answer me.
I said who are you?

50:43.160 --> 50:47.153
I'm the food guy.
I'm the food guy

50:47.440 --> 50:50.477
- I came for a friend, one of yours.
- Who?

50:50.560 --> 50:51.754
Max Cardinal.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.190
He's a good man, but he's gone.

50:54.320 --> 50:55.673
What do you mean he's gone?

50:56.320 --> 50:58.709
He got caught spying
and he's as good as dead.

51:00.520 --> 51:01.714
Get back.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.954
Oh, my back. Oh. My back.

51:06.680 --> 51:08.318
- Get him off the boat.
- Hey,

51:08.440 --> 51:10.954
there's someone down here!
He's got Parker!

51:15.600 --> 51:16.669
Oh my god!

51:20.320 --> 51:23.232
Where are we going?

53:15.080 --> 53:16.433
Keep going!

53:22.400 --> 53:24.595
- We got him.
- Oh, no.

53:43.480 --> 53:45.516
Hold! Stop the boat!

53:55.440 --> 53:58.512
- What's your name?
- Jack.

53:58.920 --> 54:00.399
I'm Emilio.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.594
Nice to meet you.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.390
You owe me a meatball sandwich.

54:16.440 --> 54:18.510
So, you are the cause
of our recent troubles.

54:18.840 --> 54:21.513
Tell you what. Replace my boat
and we'll call it even.

54:21.840 --> 54:23.034
Who sent you?

54:24.000 --> 54:25.399
I'm just a driver.

54:25.520 --> 54:28.398
I see.
You're just a simple boatman.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.113
Is that your story?

54:30.280 --> 54:32.430
I haven't said anything
about being simple.

54:32.520 --> 54:33.589
Whatever.

54:33.920 --> 54:34.989
We have your colleague

54:35.080 --> 54:37.196
and I'm sure
she will have much more to say.

54:37.560 --> 54:40.233
That's great. So you won't
be needing me then.

54:40.360 --> 54:42.271
That's correct. I don't need you,

54:42.600 --> 54:45.478
but as you're here
I may as well use you

54:45.800 --> 54:48.075
to be part of my new experiment.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.428
See you then.

54:56.720 --> 54:59.109
Well I think that went quite well,
don't you?

54:59.240 --> 55:01.117
He wasn't looking at me,
was he?

55:01.440 --> 55:03.396
He was just talking
about you, right?

55:11.440 --> 55:14.273
You mind if we sit?

55:14.640 --> 55:16.995
I have a feeling this
is going to take a while.

55:17.080 --> 55:18.274
Sure.

55:18.640 --> 55:21.359
On three. I used to do this
in dance camp.

55:21.520 --> 55:24.273
One, two, three.

55:27.920 --> 55:30.559
Except we weren't cuffed
in dance camp.

55:39.760 --> 55:41.239
So, uh...

55:43.440 --> 55:45.749
you ever have anything
like this ever happen

55:45.840 --> 55:48.638
to you and you get out
of the situation or

55:48.800 --> 55:52.475
anything remotely like this?

55:57.440 --> 56:01.274
I wanted to die fast, you know,
like by a shark.

56:07.840 --> 56:09.193
Get up.

56:11.080 --> 56:12.672
Take her to Dr. Krieger's office.

56:38.000 --> 56:39.433
Leave us.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.036
Sorry about the rough treatment,

56:56.560 --> 57:00.075
but these people only know
one way to deal with intruders.

57:02.120 --> 57:03.439
Sit down.

57:08.520 --> 57:09.999
Dr. Krieger,
you should know that

57:10.120 --> 57:11.473
the newspaper
is aware that I'm here

57:11.560 --> 57:13.118
and will be alerting
the authorities.

57:13.280 --> 57:14.759
It's all been taken care of.

57:16.120 --> 57:19.510
The coast guard reported
you lost at sea.

57:19.720 --> 57:20.994
What you don't know
is my bodyguard

57:21.080 --> 57:22.798
is on his way to the mainland
in a boat.

57:23.080 --> 57:24.274
Strange.

57:24.760 --> 57:27.274
He told me that
he was just your driver.

57:28.520 --> 57:31.114
You know, if he wouldn't
have turned around,

57:32.320 --> 57:34.197
we would have never caught him.

57:34.520 --> 57:38.115
Us being without
a helicopter these days.

57:38.920 --> 57:41.388
You know that you
owe me a helicopter.

57:41.520 --> 57:42.714
Where's Max?

57:43.720 --> 57:47.918
Looking at you, you don't look
at all like your Uncle Max.

57:48.200 --> 57:51.590
I want to see him
or I'm not saying another word.

57:52.640 --> 57:56.428
You will see him
and you will say another word,

57:56.760 --> 57:58.432
when the time has come.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.358
Applying the foundation?

58:15.720 --> 58:19.633
Sit down.
Go back and sit down.

58:30.200 --> 58:32.031
You ever play I spy?

58:32.520 --> 58:36.752
- Nah. You wanna play I spy?
- Yeah, let's play I spy.

58:37.400 --> 58:40.437
Well, now, we can if you want.

58:40.520 --> 58:42.033
Let's play I spy.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.192
Okay. I'll go first.

58:44.840 --> 58:47.229
- Okay. You got it?
- Yeah.

58:47.320 --> 58:52.155
Okay. Is it a freaky doctor?

58:54.480 --> 58:56.038
My creations.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.591
You are looking at
the deadliest ground troop...

58:58.680 --> 58:59.999
to ever walk the planet.

59:00.120 --> 59:01.599
Have a look for yourself.

59:09.040 --> 59:12.316
You won't find a more technically

59:12.440 --> 59:13.919
advanced facility anywhere
in the world.

59:17.760 --> 59:19.398
Max!

59:24.120 --> 59:27.635
He can't hear you.
He just finished his treatment.

59:27.720 --> 59:29.836
He's still coming out
of his sedation.

59:29.960 --> 59:31.029
What have you done to him?

59:31.360 --> 59:33.715
Made him a better soldier
than he ever was before.

59:34.600 --> 59:38.309
Max is right. You're a sick,
egotistical maniac.

59:38.680 --> 59:40.477
Let's not go over the top.

59:40.640 --> 59:42.278
I'm just greed.

59:42.600 --> 59:43.953
You can't imagine
how much money...

59:44.080 --> 59:46.389
the government is paying
for research like that.

59:46.520 --> 59:48.158
How can you live like that?

59:48.240 --> 59:51.118
I live fine, thank you.

59:51.280 --> 59:53.157
Let's continue the tour.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.748
Jack!

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.192
Are you okay?

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.678
- Make them pay.
- Happy reunions.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.035
He turned Max into one
of his creatures.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.035
We like to refer
to them as genetically

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.838
modified soldiers around here.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.072
Your two friends will be
undergoing the same process.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.072
Your friend Jack
has real potential.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.232
Did he say friends? Yeah, hi.
...

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.072
I don't know these people.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:32.196
I've never even seen her before.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.556
Then why did you try
to help them escape?

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.591
Escape? No, no, no.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:38.751
He hijacked the boat,
and then he hijacked me.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.031
I don't like him.
I don't even know him.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:47.271
My process
will be a waste on you.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.316
Yeah, that's right.
I'm covered in flab.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:50.509
What should we do with him, sir?

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.549
May be just kill him.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:55.633
No. no. no. no.
You don't want to kill me!

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.438
Come on.
I'll be your personal valet.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.672
I can help you in many ways.
I'm the food guy! Oh,

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.031
Oh! No! Goddammit.

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:07.590
Come on! Will you shut up?

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.030
We've gotta escape.
Stop choking, you big baby.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.473
Come on. Spit it out. Spit it out.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.431
- Pick it up.
- Pick up what?

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.469
- What does it look like?
- Holy tomato.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.834
Where'd you get that?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.037
Come on. Let me get it.
Let me get it. That's pretty good.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.596
That's very good. Buddy...

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.110
I... I got it.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.512
Okay. Okay. Open the cuffs.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.031
There it goes.
Now I missed it. You do it.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.229
Okay up.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.469
- Up like dance camp.
- One!

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.198
- Up like dance camp.
- Two! Three!

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:54.674
Okay. You do it. I can't do it.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.273
You do it. You got it?

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.753
Come on. Just do it.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.679
- Where is it?
- It's right there. Got it?

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.116
Okay, good. Nice. Nice.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.470
- Hey, what about me?
- Come on.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.392
Let's see if my work
on Max has been successful.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.070
Release GMS nine.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.033
Yes, doctor.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.675
This room is making me
claustrophobic.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.316
Whatever happens, I got your
back you got mine, okay?

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.714
Max.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.910
You know this guy?
Man, he looks rough.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.275
Good thing he doesn't know
you're banging his niece.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.079
Hey, he used to be a nice guy,
okay?

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.395
- Max?
- I don't know, man.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:12.152
He doesn't look so nice.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.029
If I've done my job correctly,

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:18.038
your Uncle Max won't rip
the arms off your friends yet,

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.318
unless I give the command.

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.635
Max, remember me? I'm Jack.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.435
I'm going to let you two sort
this out, okay?

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.719
Max,

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.997
- execute.
- Max, no! Don't do it.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.150
Let's not get carried away,
please.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.510
Max, remember me?
I'm Jack.

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:50.108
- Remember?
- Max!

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.518
Max! Kill them!

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:00.269
- Max.
- It's a dead end.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.153
Max,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.713
tischtennis. Remember?
Tischtennis

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.350
There's Valerie, up there.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.471
Max, kill them!

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.432
Come on. Come on

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.159
- What are you doing?
- He wised up.

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.555
Release GMS 7 and 8.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.435
Go! Go! Go!

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:16.037
Same team. Same team.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:19.034
That's it? That's your plan,
stay here and paint?

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.029
- I can't get a clean shot!
- Get him! Take him down!

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.593
Stop.

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:26.952
We still looking for that broad?

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.993
Holy shit. They must
do a lot of humping here,

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.553
because those things
breed like rabbits.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.234
Go.

01:08:39.319 --> 01:08:40.752
Where are we going?

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.519
Run, hide.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.595
I'm just a food guy.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.312
Asshole.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.153
Everybody, drop down!
Be aware!

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.310
Remember, eyes and mouth!

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.317
Mr. Masaki, it's Dr. Krieger.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.074
I'm ready to deliver.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.673
Are you still interested?

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.996
Good. We agree to the terms?

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.359
Wonderful.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.193
I'll see you in Shanghai.
What day?

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.391
See you then.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.032
- What is it?
- Doctor, the perimeter is overrun.

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:42.276
We are sustaining
heavy casualties.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.472
I'm going to sound
an evacuation.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.114
Let's make one thing clear.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.036
You're holding your position.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.510
My men are getting slaughtered.
I'm going to order a fallback.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.278
You're not falling back.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.198
You are holding your position.
Is that clear?

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.595
Sir, with all due respect...

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:04.674
go shove your civilian orders...
up your civilian ass.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.192
Cover me!

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.554
Chernov.

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:15.470
- Doctor.
- Some problems.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.992
- Eliminate Parker.
- Yes, doctor.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.749
Chernov.

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.674
I need an escort to the pier.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.275
- Copy that.
- Get back! Come on!

01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:39.032
Sir, Dr. Krieger's personal
boat is readying for launch.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.635
Of course. The biggest rat
is first off the sinking ship.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.036
We sure as hell ain't
going to cover his retreat.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.238
If we get there first,
we take his boat.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.754
Get all remaining units...

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.758
to rendezvous
at rally point bravo.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:56.234
All units, this is Claw Zero Six.

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.479
All claw units rendezvous at rally
point bravo. Confirm. Over.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:02.312
Copy. Rally point bravo.

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:05.079
Come on. Pull back.
Pull back!

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.117
- We lost him, sir.
- We're going to have to leave him.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.111
You are one persistent son
of a bitch.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.272
Yes I am. Let me pass.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.148
We're leaving.
Why don't you come with us?

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:20.072
Krieger still has my colleague.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.673
Well Krieger's about to leave.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:24.436
I won't let him leave with her.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.513
I admire your loyalty.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.035
It's something
in short supply around here.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.116
But once Krieger gets
on that boat,

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.473
he's no longer our concern.

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.675
Okay. I'm going to put
my weapon down.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.553
How do I find his boat?

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.672
Passageway,
back the way you came.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.629
Follow it, the stairs down
to the ground floor

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.190
and head straight to the far
end of the building.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.239
Thanks.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.030
Wait a second.
Your gun is empty.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.239
Take that.

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:19.393
Happy hunting.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.672
Remember, aim for the eyes
or the mouth.

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.473
Thank you.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.673
Parker.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.595
Get everyone back to the boats
and leave immediately.

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:47.073
- But, sir.
- It's okay. Now move.

01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.432
Where are they going?

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.829
They're withdrawing,
on my orders.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.156
Traitor. Get out.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.475
Parker! Parker!

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.392
Oh, shit.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.118
Bitch.

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.398
Chernov.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.277
- Chernov.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.759
What's going on down there?

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.110
- I'm on it.
- I'm waiting.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:35.992
Give me two minutes.

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:38.197
I'm waiting!

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.991
- I'm waiting!
- Good.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.272
You first.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.038
Chernov,

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.478
let's go to the boat.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:30.555
Tell your men to hold exactly
where they are.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:33.235
Don't move.
Stay exactly where you are.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.998
Let her go.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.517
Let the girl go.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.668
Chernov, let the girl go!

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:47.270
- Gun down.
- Dream on.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.593
Let her go.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.473
Gun down.

01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:00.394
Kill him.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.358
Max!

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:25.432
Max.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.154
Let's go.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.235
Jack! Jack! Jack!

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.390
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.278
Those freaky things
are following you.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.198
- Come on. Let's go.
- Can anybody hear me?

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.478
Can anybody hear me?

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.675
Captain, where's the boat?!

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:28.671
You must be joking.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:35.073
Step back!

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:13.152
As my editor expected, we got...

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:15.549
a visit from the men
in black suits.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.037
No story can run that
jeopardizes national security.

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.639
So what are you going to do?

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.154
I'll keep working on it.

01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.748
That's good.
So, here she is.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.033
Where'd you get that?

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.559
Insurance bought it for me.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.508
- Wait a minute. Is that Emilio?
- Yeah.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.589
He's my new deckhand
and my new cook.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.755
- A pretty decent cook.
- Wow.

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.150
Well, I should probably
get back to work.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.038
Hey, uh...

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.156
the day when you rated me two
out of ten you were joking, right?

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.352
Will I see you tomorrow?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.319
Yes.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.989
Two points.
She wouldn't see me...

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.236
if I was only two points.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:24.389
Jack,
we got our first customers.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:26.358
That's great.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.313
Hey, Jack.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.668
I think you owe
us some whales, Jack.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.392
Yeah, we wanna see whales.

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.472
You hear that? The little lady
wants to see some whales.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:35.352
They wanna see whales.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.158
Come on, Jack.
This is boat looks like...

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.639
it's faster than your last one.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.790
Where?

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.831
Wait...
Where are you going, Jack?

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:44.915
Jack?

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:47.508
- Jack?
- You do it, Emilio.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.828
- What? I don't know...
- It's all yours.

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.592
- anything about the whales!
- I don't care.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.631
He's just having a little hissy-fit.
He'll come right back.

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:57.272
Just shut up.
You're scaring him. Jack! Jack!

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.396
He's German. He's emotional.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.675
Come on.
I'm making franks and beans!

01:26:01.676 --> 01:26:02.676
