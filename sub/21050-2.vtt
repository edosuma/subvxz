00:18.960 --> 00:23.493
Ah! Good morning, you
gleaming bit of bounty.

00:25.945 --> 00:29.391
- Beakley?
- I feel I should prepare you.

00:29.426 --> 00:31.126
For what's out there.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.986
How bad can it be?

00:33.022 --> 00:34.909
Lid left off the peanut butter.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.542
Errant roller skate
left on the stairway.

00:40.690 --> 00:43.127
An elaborate series
of cutthroat war games.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.673
Take that.

00:47.703 --> 00:50.328
Dewey, don't yell at your target

00:50.354 --> 00:51.888
before you fire.

00:51.915 --> 00:53.815
You lose the element of surprise.

00:59.348 --> 01:02.105
Good hands, Beakley.

01:02.138 --> 01:04.355
When I said you should spend
more time with your family,

01:04.381 --> 01:06.151
I did not mean move them in.

01:06.180 --> 01:08.047
Whoo hoo!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.455
Target acquired.

01:22.004 --> 01:24.967
You set traps? It's just a game.

01:24.993 --> 01:27.382
You're not a player, you're a pawn.

01:27.417 --> 01:30.070
Webby, maybe take it down a notch.

01:30.096 --> 01:32.910
- Tell that to my men you captured in Peking.
- What?

01:32.940 --> 01:34.596
It's part of my character's backstory.

01:34.626 --> 01:36.050
Grizzled ex-special forces

01:36.069 --> 01:38.656
pulled out of retirement
for revenge. What's yours?

01:38.662 --> 01:41.202
My guy has a dart gun?

01:41.228 --> 01:42.889
Not anymore.

01:47.395 --> 01:48.469
Ha ha!

01:58.399 --> 02:00.716
The foyer's a safe zone. The foyer's...

02:00.751 --> 02:02.268
This is no foyer.

02:02.303 --> 02:04.495
This is a tomb.

02:04.530 --> 02:05.984
Oh, my tailbone!

02:06.017 --> 02:07.836
A tomb.

02:07.856 --> 02:10.056
Sir, this is out of control.

02:10.086 --> 02:11.352
Kids will be kids.

02:11.387 --> 02:12.656
For everyone's happiness,

02:12.678 --> 02:15.449
we've all got to make sacrifices.

02:15.474 --> 02:18.650
Um, ocupado.

02:18.691 --> 02:22.175
House meeting now!

03:20.325 --> 03:22.421
_

03:26.487 --> 03:29.749
All right. Time for some house rules.

03:31.017 --> 03:34.442
Rule one: My space is my space.

03:34.478 --> 03:37.496
My study, my sleeping quarters.

03:37.532 --> 03:40.193
My washroom.

03:40.219 --> 03:43.640
Rule two: Defer to Mrs. Beakley
for all subsequent rules.

03:43.662 --> 03:44.946
I'm pleased to have you here,

03:44.959 --> 03:47.146
as long as it in no
way inconveniences me.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.160
Good day.

03:49.452 --> 03:51.410
This may be Mr. McDuck's mansion,

03:51.445 --> 03:52.753
but it's my house.

03:52.779 --> 03:55.646
So... my house rules.

03:55.666 --> 03:59.740
Exhaustive. Comprehensive.
Where are you going?

03:59.770 --> 04:02.604
I got unmentionables to wash.

04:02.639 --> 04:04.965
Rule 58: If you need something,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.551
ask for permission first.

04:07.570 --> 04:10.612
Did you hear that, boys? Ask permission.

04:10.647 --> 04:13.554
Rule #23: No one is above the rules...

04:13.574 --> 04:14.629
Donald.

04:14.657 --> 04:16.423
If you had simply asked for assistance,

04:16.428 --> 04:18.250
we could've avoided
what I'm referring to as

04:18.261 --> 04:20.226
the "Undergarment Incident."

04:21.697 --> 04:23.945
I can take care of myself.

04:23.978 --> 04:26.732
That is not your decision to make.

04:26.758 --> 04:28.880
You live here, you answer to me.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.208
I answer to no one!

04:33.481 --> 04:35.904
- Wait, are they gonna kiss?
- Eww!

04:35.940 --> 04:37.874
Outside now.

04:42.345 --> 04:44.380
Death Darts was fun.

04:44.415 --> 04:46.289
Again, just supposed to be darts.

04:46.324 --> 04:47.824
What do you wanna play next?

04:47.860 --> 04:50.402
Mystery Murder Island, Cannonball Fury?

04:50.437 --> 04:53.371
How about a nice, safe nap?

04:53.407 --> 04:55.250
Oh, how about Sacky Sack?

05:01.265 --> 05:04.850
Or we could go have some real fun.

05:04.885 --> 05:07.903
- You mean...
- I do, dear Dewford.

05:07.938 --> 05:11.172
It's time for Funso's Fun Zone!

05:11.208 --> 05:12.340
What's that?

05:12.375 --> 05:13.913
Only the greatest place

05:13.938 --> 05:15.854
one could ever imagine imagining!

05:15.888 --> 05:17.560
Where your dreams become reality,

05:17.579 --> 05:20.253
and reality becomes some
crazy kind of hyper-dream.

05:20.271 --> 05:22.640

Oh. Well, have fun.

You coming?

05:36.999 --> 05:38.417
What? Yeah!

05:38.452 --> 05:39.651
Let me get my stuff.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.965
I don't know. Webby's
great for treasure hunting

05:45.000 --> 05:46.083
and mine cart chases,

05:46.118 --> 05:49.110
but she's not exactly built
for every-day kid stuff.

05:49.137 --> 05:51.148
I still see the darts
when I close my eyes.

05:51.177 --> 05:53.144
She's been cooped up in
a mansion her whole life.

05:53.175 --> 05:55.175
Of course she's gonna
be a little... off.

05:55.197 --> 05:57.435
But we can help her. She'll be fine.

05:57.471 --> 05:59.588
All right, Webby, just
a totally casual hang-out

05:59.623 --> 06:02.774
in the real world. Like regular kids do.

06:02.810 --> 06:04.584
Play it cool, play it cool.

06:04.619 --> 06:09.264
Whooooo!

06:18.934 --> 06:20.200
Hmm.

06:32.305 --> 06:35.568
Howdy, neighbor. Kielbasa?

06:35.596 --> 06:38.264
I'll just live on the
boat while I fix it.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.229
Out of your house, out of your way.

06:41.265 --> 06:43.198
Causing several fire hazards.

06:43.233 --> 06:44.621
If you had checked with me,

06:44.638 --> 06:47.500
I could've provided
safe electrical hook-ups.

06:47.515 --> 06:48.546
I'm good.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.742
And how would you like
to split the water bill?

06:51.776 --> 06:55.310
Richest duck in Duck
Burg can't spare a dime.

06:55.345 --> 06:56.687
Keep your water.

07:14.973 --> 07:16.568
You've been on a bus before, right?

07:16.608 --> 07:18.465
Absolutely.

07:18.498 --> 07:20.811
So is it assigned seating or...

07:23.788 --> 07:25.612
Don't talk to anybody,
don't touch anything,

07:25.629 --> 07:27.789
don't lick anything, don't
go near the emergency brake.

07:33.692 --> 07:38.541
Ooh, ooh. Ha ha! I'm Webby.

07:38.551 --> 07:41.765
Have you ever jumped a ravine in
this baby? Can I try? I'm Webby.

07:48.983 --> 07:52.451
Look, a dog, wearing a bow tie.

07:52.477 --> 07:53.825
Did he tie it himself?

07:53.862 --> 07:55.070
Stop the bus!

08:03.330 --> 08:05.180
It was a nice bow tie.

08:05.215 --> 08:07.446
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

08:07.470 --> 08:09.354
It's just a short walk to Funso's.

08:09.382 --> 08:11.449
Through the sketchiest
neighborhood in town.

08:14.436 --> 08:16.916

08:16.919 --> 08:18.777
Bet it's a faster run. Race ya!

08:18.812 --> 08:20.562
Wrong way.

08:20.588 --> 08:21.521
Whoop.

08:24.868 --> 08:27.443
Hey, is that the McDuck brats?

08:27.479 --> 08:29.637
- Let's get 'em.
- Uh-uh.

08:29.672 --> 08:31.580
Burger's right. Ma told us

08:31.609 --> 08:33.592
we's only supposed to
take down the truck.

08:33.626 --> 08:36.140
Forget the truck. That's the payday.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.408
Think big.

08:39.851 --> 08:42.187
Sorry, Carl. Same time next month?

If you wanna get by in this world,

09:16.371 --> 09:19.208
you gotta know the
people who make it spin.

Josie, new token apron?

Nice.

Your usual table, sir.

09:26.021 --> 09:28.129
Merci, Toby.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.848
Webby, your money is no good here.

09:33.877 --> 09:37.112
What do they take? I have
pounds, pesos, rubles.

09:37.133 --> 09:39.541
The oldest currency in the world.

09:39.568 --> 09:40.901
Ancient obsidian rune stones?

09:40.921 --> 09:42.244
No, flattery.

09:42.279 --> 09:44.065
Ahem. I can't tell.

09:44.085 --> 09:46.515
Is that the heat lamps
or your natural glow?

09:46.550 --> 09:48.750
Oh, Mr. Duck, the usual?

09:48.786 --> 09:51.818
Yep. One free cup for water, please.

09:54.825 --> 09:57.192
- That's not water.
- It's all part of the system.

09:57.227 --> 09:59.469
You try.

09:59.504 --> 10:01.455
Hey, you.

10:06.768 --> 10:09.228
I was hoping you could hook a gal up

10:11.542 --> 10:13.613
You know, fruit punch.

10:14.953 --> 10:17.971
You sure you don't want it for water?

10:18.006 --> 10:19.514
Yes, for water.

10:19.549 --> 10:21.400
Fruity water...

10:21.427 --> 10:23.354
that really packs a punch.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.719
Am I right?

10:24.754 --> 10:26.621
I don't know what you mean.

10:26.656 --> 10:27.822
I mean fruit punch.

10:27.857 --> 10:29.632
There a problem here?

10:36.141 --> 10:39.993
What did I tell you about
handing out freebies, Jane?

10:40.029 --> 10:41.556
You pay for that punch, Duck?

10:41.576 --> 10:43.430
I was just about to.

10:43.456 --> 10:44.756
Yeah.

Welcome to Funso's.
There's no place finer.

Behold, the best game ever created!

11:47.921 --> 11:49.177
Japanese import.

11:49.203 --> 11:50.670
There's only one in the U.S.

11:50.698 --> 11:52.497
and I have the top ten score,

11:52.536 --> 11:54.586
so I'm pretty much the
best in the country.

11:54.619 --> 11:56.110
You gotta try this.

11:56.146 --> 11:57.787
I don't know. I've never actually

11:57.822 --> 12:00.431
played a computer game.

12:00.466 --> 12:01.733
Do you play an instrument?

12:01.773 --> 12:03.242
I took seven years of cello.

12:03.266 --> 12:04.891
Same thing.

12:10.183 --> 12:11.557
Oh!

12:15.173 --> 12:17.757
Your first strum. Cherish it.

12:22.013 --> 12:24.731
Yes, yes, be one with the flow.

12:26.902 --> 12:30.213
I am both uking and puking.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.080
- Time for...
- Strangers are danger!

12:32.115 --> 12:33.513
Webby, no!

12:39.597 --> 12:41.871
I killed Funso.

12:41.911 --> 12:44.389
No, no. Don't you die on me!

12:49.141 --> 12:52.935
My scores. No!!

12:52.961 --> 12:55.525
It's like I don't even know you anymore.

13:24.126 --> 13:26.118
Perhaps we could put
your nephew up in a hotel.

13:26.153 --> 13:27.942
In New Zealand.

13:27.983 --> 13:29.482
No time. Guest bath's a-callin'.

13:29.511 --> 13:30.569
Beakley problem.

13:33.760 --> 13:35.955
- Ow.
- Room for three more?

13:37.981 --> 13:40.123
You guys aren't mad I ruined Funso's?

13:40.158 --> 13:42.348
Please. Funso's is a place of magic

13:42.375 --> 13:44.182
and wonder and light.

13:44.208 --> 13:45.720
Think fast!

13:48.558 --> 13:50.374
Wait. What's happening?

13:50.410 --> 13:51.834
Nope, you're fine.

13:51.869 --> 13:53.645
It's a trap. I'm sinking.

14:08.119 --> 14:10.119
I'm Webby.

14:13.675 --> 14:16.064
You are banned from Funso's for life.

14:16.097 --> 14:19.154
No, please. I've never
been kicked out of anything.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.722
And this is why I said
we shouldn't bring her.

14:21.758 --> 14:23.174
Thanks, Dewey.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.362
Funso, take them out.

14:27.379 --> 14:29.254
With pleasure.

14:29.281 --> 14:30.548
Call Ma.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.342
You can't come in without a child.

14:44.147 --> 14:46.552
Everybody out!

14:50.987 --> 14:52.779
This is it, Ma.

14:52.814 --> 14:55.560
The big payday. The perfect scam.

14:55.593 --> 14:57.842
Save it. What's so
important that I don't see

14:57.877 --> 14:59.652
an armored car parked out front?

14:59.687 --> 15:02.347
May I present our new meal ticket?

15:04.217 --> 15:06.091
Scrooge McDuck's family.

15:10.524 --> 15:12.822
And how did you manage this?

15:12.850 --> 15:15.396
Well, we cornered 'em, we captured 'em,

15:15.415 --> 15:17.020
and we sent him a ransom note.

15:17.055 --> 15:18.876
You did what?

15:28.634 --> 15:32.098
How did someone so
brilliant raise such morons?

15:32.120 --> 15:34.587
I think she's talking about you.

15:34.622 --> 15:36.163
But Scrooge will pay a fortune

15:36.199 --> 15:37.406
to get them ankle biters back.

15:37.442 --> 15:40.551
Do you think he got to be
the richest duck in Duck Burg

15:40.586 --> 15:42.329
by paying people off?

15:42.348 --> 15:45.369
You just painted four
twerp-size targets on our backs.

15:45.405 --> 15:47.876
Bouncer, Burger, go wait outside.

15:48.737 --> 15:50.456
What about me, Ma?

15:52.411 --> 15:54.908
You're on a time-out, mister.

15:54.943 --> 15:56.457
Who are these guys?

15:56.477 --> 15:58.504
The Beagle boys. They hate your uncle.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.370
Try to break into the
mansion all the time.

16:00.406 --> 16:01.631
Are they gonna ransom us?

16:01.653 --> 16:04.252
Scrooge will never
pay for all four of us.

16:04.277 --> 16:06.674
You're right. He'll probably
throw one of us off a cliff

16:06.687 --> 16:07.925
to send Scrooge a message.

16:14.638 --> 16:16.079
Scrooge, the kids!

16:16.114 --> 16:17.677
The Beagle Boys!

16:19.850 --> 16:22.384
Wait. Something's wrong.

16:24.381 --> 16:26.297
Much better.

16:29.561 --> 16:31.842
Mrs. B., a brick, a note.

16:31.868 --> 16:34.169
Look who's finally
coming to ask for my...

16:34.202 --> 16:35.252
Help!!

16:36.801 --> 16:39.360
What is a Funso?

16:39.395 --> 16:41.667
Don't capture Scrooge's brats, Big Time.

16:41.689 --> 16:44.086
Don't stick up the
policeman's ball, Big Time.

16:44.108 --> 16:46.150
Tanks don't float, Big Time.

16:46.185 --> 16:48.165
She always treats me
like the odd man out

16:48.183 --> 16:50.591
- because my ideas are too...
- Intense?

16:50.618 --> 16:52.340
Visionary.

16:52.375 --> 16:53.766
Well, I'll show her.

16:53.802 --> 16:55.473
I'll show 'em all.

16:55.502 --> 16:56.902
That's not something you wanna hear

16:56.918 --> 16:59.936
- when you're tied up in a meat locker.
- Startin' with you.

17:01.134 --> 17:02.532
Webby?!

17:02.572 --> 17:04.392
Oops. Sorry. I'll just...

17:04.417 --> 17:06.776
You could slip out of
those ropes the whole time?

17:06.797 --> 17:08.319
Well, yeah. That's, like,

17:08.358 --> 17:09.990
Being Captured 101.

17:10.026 --> 17:12.292
So why didn't you?

17:12.329 --> 17:14.729
Because I don't want
you to think I'm weird.

17:14.755 --> 17:17.078
I've been stuck in the
mansion for so long,

17:17.099 --> 17:19.009
and I'm trying really hard to be normal.

17:19.036 --> 17:22.996
But everything I do is, you know, not.

17:23.031 --> 17:25.106
Normal's overrated.

17:25.142 --> 17:27.400
We need you to be Webby-normal.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.252
I'm gonna break every bone in her body.

17:40.272 --> 17:43.018
Or maybe just tie her up.
We'll see how it plays out.

17:53.953 --> 17:55.986
All right, boys.

17:56.022 --> 17:58.467
McDuck's high-falutin' hooligan Beakley

17:58.499 --> 18:00.524
is coming here to take you down.

18:00.534 --> 18:01.888
Are you gonna let her?

18:01.921 --> 18:03.520
Mmm...

18:03.555 --> 18:05.694
No, you are not.

18:05.714 --> 18:08.491
Beakley may be strong,
ruthless and unforgiving,

18:08.526 --> 18:10.376
but you are the Beagle Boys.

18:10.402 --> 18:11.536
My boys.

18:11.572 --> 18:14.256
It's time to mark your territory.

18:17.249 --> 18:19.833
Do it for your dear old ma.

18:22.952 --> 18:25.223
"Dear Ma Beagle, if you ever want to see

18:25.260 --> 18:26.625
your son again..."

18:26.645 --> 18:28.179
Oh, for cryin' out loud.

18:33.501 --> 18:35.067
You take care of them.

18:35.103 --> 18:37.350
I'll deal with the squirts.

18:44.036 --> 18:45.835
Beagle Boys are slow but quite large.

18:45.868 --> 18:47.710
I'll take the big one and... Donald?

18:49.233 --> 18:51.401
Give me back my boys!

18:57.993 --> 18:59.119
Get off me.

19:03.965 --> 19:05.639
I guess he can take care of himself.

19:11.206 --> 19:13.406
Come on, kids.

19:13.441 --> 19:15.110
I don't have time for games.

19:15.123 --> 19:17.277
Then you're in the wrong place.

19:17.312 --> 19:20.174
Funso's Fun Zone.

19:20.194 --> 19:22.828
Where the fun is in the zone...

19:54.423 --> 19:57.502
Oh! You can't outrun me.

19:57.528 --> 19:59.435
You know how many two-foot terrors

19:59.455 --> 20:01.579
I chased around the junkyard?

20:01.614 --> 20:03.214
But I'm not outrunning you.

20:03.249 --> 20:07.006
Whee! I'm leaving you.

20:09.998 --> 20:11.789
Hi, Ma.

20:11.824 --> 20:13.754
Seriously, Big Time?

20:16.710 --> 20:19.296
What the... Stupid plastic garbage.

20:19.332 --> 20:21.971
Wait, no, stop. It's a trap!

20:23.252 --> 20:25.391
I know, right? Now!

20:35.614 --> 20:37.038
Boys!

20:39.902 --> 20:41.769
A slipstitch. Good choice, dear.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.092
Thanks, Granny.

20:43.131 --> 20:44.897
It's okay, Ma.

20:44.932 --> 20:46.936
I tried, and that's what matters, right?

20:46.956 --> 20:48.815
Shut up, Big Time.

20:48.833 --> 20:51.333
Why can't we have what they have?

20:52.453 --> 20:55.289
Now flip the circuit on the
boat's panel and you'll have power.

20:56.686 --> 20:59.044
Thanks, Mrs. B.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.739
So how does a housekeeper know so much

21:01.775 --> 21:04.250
about electricity and Tae Kwon Do?

21:04.285 --> 21:05.681
Oh, simple. I'm a spy.

21:13.607 --> 21:15.148
Nice of Funso's to lift the ban

21:15.185 --> 21:16.577
and give us all those free tokens,

21:16.612 --> 21:18.417
you know, to keep us from suing them.

21:18.449 --> 21:19.754
Yep, the system works.

21:19.782 --> 21:21.322
So what should we do next?

21:21.332 --> 21:23.574
I don't know. Webby?
What do you wanna play?

21:23.603 --> 21:26.414
- Really? You mean it?
- Any crazy thing you want.

21:26.447 --> 21:28.421
Oh, how about a nice game of...

21:28.450 --> 21:31.381
Medieval Dungeon of Eternal Screaming?

21:31.414 --> 21:32.583
I'm on Webby's team.
