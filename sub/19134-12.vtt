00:00.291 --> 00:01.613
<i>Previously on The Magicians.</i>

00:01.738 --> 00:03.835
Hey, can you help me
find some information?

00:03.952 --> 00:04.716
What are you looking for?

00:04.830 --> 00:08.535
Well, say a... a being with
an enormous amount of power.

00:08.655 --> 00:12.023
I'm looking for how someone
might, you know, defeat them.

00:13.659 --> 00:15.159
"The art of killing gods."

00:15.228 --> 00:16.427
Any word on the Poison Room?

00:16.495 --> 00:17.673
Believe me,
I wanna get in there.

00:17.697 --> 00:19.196
- It's... it's above my pay grade.
- It's... it's above my pay grade.

00:20.700 --> 00:22.399
- You really don't need my help?
- With what?

00:22.468 --> 00:24.034
Trying to break into
the Poison Room.

00:24.103 --> 00:26.971
I am telling you the truth
because you are the one I trust,

00:27.039 --> 00:29.440
and I really just need
your support right now.

00:29.508 --> 00:31.108
<i>I controlled their minds.</i>

00:31.177 --> 00:32.576
Of course, honey.

00:32.645 --> 00:34.778
<i>Just like you have,
many, many times.</i>

00:34.847 --> 00:36.747
<i>They said they were
just trying to summon</i>

00:36.816 --> 00:38.048
<i>a little help
from some kind of god.</i>

00:38.117 --> 00:40.084
They were summoning
an evil bitch.

00:40.152 --> 00:41.986
The benevolent
Our Lady Underground.

00:42.054 --> 00:43.254
It is all about her.

00:43.322 --> 00:45.356
Grinding men men and gods
into the fucking dirt,

00:45.424 --> 00:46.523
and then she leaves!

00:46.592 --> 00:47.858
That's Miss Persephone.

00:47.927 --> 00:49.393
That's Our Lady Underground.

00:49.462 --> 00:51.562
Julia, why do you look
like a 12-year-old?

00:51.631 --> 00:52.830
Because I'm her shade.

00:52.898 --> 00:55.132
Shades go to the underworld.

00:55.201 --> 00:57.067
- Alice.
- Quentin.

00:57.136 --> 00:58.168
I missed you so much.

00:58.237 --> 01:00.537
Is there any way
we can take her with us?

01:02.541 --> 01:03.874
- Jules, what the hell?
- I know.

01:03.943 --> 01:05.242
<i>This is my one shot,
and this is what</i>

01:05.311 --> 01:06.410
<i>I want to do with it.</i>

01:07.680 --> 01:11.682
No one has ever brought
niffin back to life.

01:11.751 --> 01:14.218
Many try, but all...

01:19.859 --> 01:22.726
We have something that
no one else has ever had.

01:22.795 --> 01:24.795
We have Alice's shade.

01:24.864 --> 01:27.298
The meta-math has never
added up before,

01:27.366 --> 01:28.766
but with this...

01:30.569 --> 01:32.369
Still tremendously bad idea.

01:32.438 --> 01:33.937
Fine, fuck him.

01:34.006 --> 01:36.740
He won't help us.
We'll take it to Dean Fogg.

01:36.809 --> 01:39.843
With one morning fart,
I release more magic

01:39.912 --> 01:42.346
than Henry Fogg has
in his whole life.

01:42.415 --> 01:43.814
But you can't
get it up for this?

01:43.883 --> 01:46.817
No, you can't.
I won't.

01:46.886 --> 01:52.990
The energy we would need would
take a hundred Master Magicians.

01:58.164 --> 01:59.797
That's a battery.

01:59.865 --> 02:02.866
That holds magical current.

02:02.935 --> 02:04.668
That is the biggest one
that I've ever seen.

02:04.737 --> 02:06.370
How many of those do you have?

02:06.439 --> 02:07.604
Not enough to spare.

02:07.673 --> 02:09.639
Took years to make,
and I need it.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.241
- No.
- What's more important

02:11.310 --> 02:12.409
than a life?

02:12.478 --> 02:13.777
You talk like life
means something.

02:13.846 --> 02:15.286
If it doesn't,
then what's the point?

02:15.348 --> 02:16.747
This is what magic is for.

02:16.816 --> 02:19.616
Boldly spoken for a student
who lacked the balls

02:19.685 --> 02:21.151
to control a flea.

02:21.220 --> 02:25.255
Look, I survived your abuse,
and I got off my ass,

02:25.324 --> 02:26.590
and I went
into the goddamn world.

02:26.659 --> 02:27.659
What have you done?
You--

02:27.727 --> 02:29.560
you've sat around and drank.

02:29.628 --> 02:31.462
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

02:31.530 --> 02:33.597
Do you know why Alice
went to Brakebills?

02:33.666 --> 02:35.099
To find out what happened
to her brother.

02:35.167 --> 02:38.202
What happened was his friend
Emily had the bad sense

02:38.270 --> 02:40.671
to fall in love with you,
and it destroyed her.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.240
And when he tried to help,
it turned him into a niffin.

02:43.309 --> 02:47.845
Now tell me that you hold
zero responsibility for that.

02:47.913 --> 02:51.782
You can't erase any of that,
but you can help Alice.

02:51.851 --> 02:53.951
You can help Alice now.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.733 --> 03:10.367
You look worried.

03:10.436 --> 03:12.870
Just thinking about Alice.

03:12.938 --> 03:15.239
She's gonna be
really pissed at me.

03:15.307 --> 03:19.877
Yeah, but when she has
her Shade back, she'll get it.

03:19.945 --> 03:21.612
Trust me.

03:21.680 --> 03:25.849
Um...speaking of Shades,
since this is probably

03:25.918 --> 03:27.518
the last time I'm going
to have one...

03:27.586 --> 03:31.488
Look, you do not
have to do this.

03:31.557 --> 03:33.056
Yes, I do.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.593
You're a good friend,
better one than I deserve.

03:36.662 --> 03:37.594
Not true.

03:37.663 --> 03:39.596
Blah, blah, feelings bullshit.

03:39.665 --> 03:41.064
Let's begin.

03:41.133 --> 03:45.202
First we separate Shade,
which will pull niffin here.

03:45.271 --> 03:46.603
- You memorize?
- Yeah.

03:46.672 --> 03:49.273
- You can handle it?
- Yes.

04:33.085 --> 04:36.887
I'm going to fix you,
but I just have to lock you

04:36.956 --> 04:39.456
in here for a minute, okay?

04:44.230 --> 04:46.230
Thank you.

04:49.235 --> 04:52.069
Julia, lock the cage.

05:16.495 --> 05:17.628
She's coming.

05:35.881 --> 05:37.814
Quentin!

05:37.883 --> 05:39.950
I'll burn you alive for this!

05:40.019 --> 05:41.718
When you're ready, Coldwater.

05:41.787 --> 05:42.719
It's gonna be okay.

05:46.926 --> 05:48.592
Please, please, Quentin, don't.

06:15.054 --> 06:26.378
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

06:26.498 --> 06:28.265
Hey.

06:30.135 --> 06:33.370
I brought you some clothes
if you, um...

06:35.741 --> 06:37.774
Okay.

06:46.352 --> 06:47.784
Why don't I go
get you some food?

06:47.853 --> 06:50.287
You haven't eaten in, um...

06:52.391 --> 06:57.394
Mayakovsky said to start
with really bland food,

06:57.463 --> 07:00.597
so I thought oatmeal.

07:00.666 --> 07:02.899
Why?

07:02.968 --> 07:06.603
Why bland food?
Or why...

07:06.672 --> 07:08.138
Why did I bring you back?

07:08.207 --> 07:11.341
Mm.

07:11.410 --> 07:14.044
I couldn't leave you like that.

07:19.184 --> 07:20.984
Alice.

07:23.188 --> 07:25.222
Fuck you.

07:30.529 --> 07:32.462
<i>So, the Poison Room.</i>

07:32.531 --> 07:37.067
The code to the door
changes every couple hours.

07:37.136 --> 07:39.603
The door itself
is warded, alarmed.

07:39.672 --> 07:41.204
And don't forget
booby-trapped.

07:41.273 --> 07:44.274
So instead of going through
the magical dismemberment door,

07:44.343 --> 07:47.044
let's go through the back way.

07:47.112 --> 07:49.946
That door isn't just a door.

07:50.015 --> 07:51.815
It's a portal to another world.

07:51.884 --> 07:54.351
That's where the Poison Room is.

07:54.420 --> 07:55.919
So if we find
the right fountain...?

07:55.988 --> 07:57.387
We can walk right in.

07:57.456 --> 07:59.623
I heard a couple librarians
whispering about it.

07:59.692 --> 08:02.859
The Poison Room fountain has
a stack of books for a statue.

08:02.928 --> 08:05.429
If we split up,
we could probably find it

08:05.497 --> 08:06.763
within a matter of weeks.

08:06.832 --> 08:09.866
Weeks?
No, no, no, I got this.

08:09.935 --> 08:10.935
Think hours.

08:10.969 --> 08:12.009
What makes you so cocky?

08:12.037 --> 08:13.437
'Cause I'm a traveler.

08:13.505 --> 08:16.206
And, for once, it's not
totally fucking me.

08:22.314 --> 08:25.682
It is customary to bow in
the presence of your High King.

08:25.751 --> 08:29.319
I--wh--
How are you here?

08:29.388 --> 08:32.155
I think, and by that,
I mean I'm absolutely certain,

08:32.224 --> 08:35.325
that I was banished.
Had to be.

08:35.394 --> 08:39.496
So in the books, Ember and Umber
before Martin offed him,

08:39.565 --> 08:41.932
they did this to the Chatwins
all the time, right?

08:42.000 --> 08:46.937
Mm-hmm, um, yeah.

08:47.005 --> 08:50.507
When their adventure
was done, or...

08:50.576 --> 08:51.775
Or what, Q?

08:51.844 --> 08:53.977
My pregnant wife
is locked up in Fairy Gitmo.

08:54.046 --> 08:55.746
I'm betrothed to a rat.

08:55.814 --> 08:58.115
My Pinot noir grapes
are nearly ripe.

08:58.183 --> 09:03.820
My adventure's just begun, so
why else would Ember banish me?

09:03.889 --> 09:06.523
Because I'm a fuck up.
That's it.

09:06.592 --> 09:08.959
So the button.
Gimme.

09:09.027 --> 09:12.329
Uh, about that, um,
we kind of bargained it away

09:12.397 --> 09:15.966
to a dragon in exchange
for tickets to the Underworld.

09:16.034 --> 09:19.669
You gave our only means
of traveling to Fillory

09:19.738 --> 09:22.372
to fucking Trogdor?

09:30.649 --> 09:31.782
Oh.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.292
Both the high king and queen
have vanished

09:40.339 --> 09:42.566
leaving you the only
Child of Earth in Fillory.

09:42.686 --> 09:44.007
Oh, my God.

09:45.112 --> 09:46.403
They were my ride home.

09:46.523 --> 09:50.211
Um, yes, also
it makes you High King.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.316
You can go to the Rainbow Bridge
to be crowned.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.761
Meh, let's skip the ceremony.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.930
On to business, then.

10:05.999 --> 10:07.465
Half the court are still rats.

10:07.534 --> 10:09.601
The talking beavers
are in revolt.

10:09.669 --> 10:11.169
They're demanding
dental coverage.

10:11.238 --> 10:13.118
And the Measly Mountains,
they've disappeared.

10:13.173 --> 10:15.440
Completely just--
Stop!

10:15.508 --> 10:18.376
The thrones are cursed.

10:18.445 --> 10:21.813
Okay, is anything not fucked?

10:21.882 --> 10:25.884
Your High Kingliness, perhaps
this is all too much for you.

10:25.952 --> 10:29.187
There was a great king
on Earth who had a philosophy:

10:29.256 --> 10:31.222
"Hakuna matata."

10:31.291 --> 10:34.092
Roughly translated,
it means, "no worries."

10:34.160 --> 10:35.693
That's my philosophy too.

10:35.762 --> 10:38.062
Who gives a shit
about a few Measly Mountains?

10:38.131 --> 10:39.664
- But--
- Erase them.

10:39.733 --> 10:41.900
Bring in the talking rats
to translate for the rat people,

10:41.968 --> 10:44.769
and we are giving
all those beavers braces

10:44.838 --> 10:47.105
because they deserve it.

10:47.173 --> 10:48.673
Say it, Tick.

10:51.177 --> 10:53.211
Hakuna matata.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.480
That's what I'm talking about.

12:11.157 --> 12:14.492
And then I lost it
again for good,

12:14.561 --> 12:18.196
but I also discovered
that I don't have to be

12:18.264 --> 12:19.364
like The Beast.

12:19.432 --> 12:21.065
With the right help,
I can do good.

12:21.134 --> 12:22.500
I just have a chip missing.

12:22.569 --> 12:25.136
What do you want from me, Julia?

12:25.205 --> 12:27.438
To be the missing chip.

12:27.507 --> 12:29.707
Tell me when
to tap on the brakes.

12:29.776 --> 12:31.776
Tap?

12:31.845 --> 12:34.245
Slam on them.

12:34.314 --> 12:36.247
I trust you.

12:36.316 --> 12:39.384
I need you.

12:39.452 --> 12:42.887
Shit.

12:44.991 --> 12:48.259
Okay, we can try it.

12:48.328 --> 12:53.331
The thing is, I think I kind of
need you too right now.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.933
There's something
you need to know.

12:56.002 --> 12:57.869
Does Reynard
know that you're here?

12:57.937 --> 12:58.669
No.

12:58.738 --> 12:59.937
Okay, that's good.

13:00.006 --> 13:01.472
It's important that
we keep up appearances.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.874
I know.
I've seen what he can do

13:02.942 --> 13:03.841
when he's angry.

13:03.910 --> 13:08.212
John, tell her what you told me

13:08.281 --> 13:10.581
about Our Lady Underground.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.417
Reynard's obsessed with her.

13:12.485 --> 13:14.018
I think they were lovers,
but she left him.

13:14.087 --> 13:17.188
Everything that he's done
to her followers, to you--

13:17.257 --> 13:19.323
It's not random.

13:19.392 --> 13:23.027
- It's to get back at her.
- Yeah.

13:23.096 --> 13:25.530
Holy shit.

13:32.038 --> 13:34.772
Persephone is
Our lady Underground.

13:34.841 --> 13:36.974
I saw her icons
when I was down there.

13:37.043 --> 13:39.811
Maybe we can use her
to lure Reynard.

13:39.879 --> 13:41.646
Didn't you just say
that she disappeared?

13:41.714 --> 13:43.434
Well, we just need
to make Reynard believe

13:43.483 --> 13:44.916
that it's her.

13:44.984 --> 13:46.984
If he thinks that she's here,
he'll come.

13:47.053 --> 13:48.419
Well, okay, and then?

13:48.488 --> 13:50.455
We still don't have a weapon.

13:50.523 --> 13:51.589
We have him.

13:51.658 --> 13:53.658
- What do you--?
- No, no, no,

13:53.726 --> 13:55.760
we are not killing you
for your power, John.

13:55.829 --> 13:57.328
- That's insane.
- Agreed.

13:57.397 --> 13:58.529
Off the table.

13:58.598 --> 14:01.199
What we are gonna do
is teach you magic.

14:01.267 --> 14:02.467
I'm not a Magician.

14:02.535 --> 14:04.869
No, you're more,

14:04.938 --> 14:06.737
which is why it should be
easy for you to learn.

14:06.806 --> 14:10.775
I mean, we don't have the juice
to take Reynard on, but you do.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.980
Can you tell me again
what the dragon said?

14:16.049 --> 14:19.717
You know Mayakovsky banned me
from seeing Alice for 48 hours?

14:19.786 --> 14:21.919
He said that I am upsetting her.

14:21.988 --> 14:23.588
Well, he's not exactly wrong.

14:23.656 --> 14:24.922
Trying to help.

14:24.991 --> 14:27.091
You did.
Now maybe you can help

14:27.160 --> 14:28.893
- by letting it run its course.
- What if she--?

14:28.962 --> 14:33.498
Q, the greatest Magician
on Earth is watching her.

14:33.566 --> 14:35.833
I know Mayakovsky can be
a massive asshole,

14:35.902 --> 14:40.438
but he's not gonna actually
let anything happen to her,

14:40.507 --> 14:45.376
not after what it cost him
to bring her back.

14:45.445 --> 14:47.912
All right, let's do that.

14:54.954 --> 14:59.223
I know it's hard right now,
but it's gonna be okay.

14:59.292 --> 15:00.725
I think.

15:00.793 --> 15:02.927
Now will you please tell me
what Puff the Magic Dragon

15:02.996 --> 15:05.730
said to you?

15:05.798 --> 15:09.901
"The first portal
is still open."

15:11.738 --> 15:14.372
I thought that might mean
Stonehenge.

15:14.440 --> 15:17.842
The kids go there in Book Three.

15:17.911 --> 15:20.244
How many times
was that portal open?

15:20.313 --> 15:21.579
Once.

15:21.648 --> 15:24.982
It's always
some new, unexpected...

15:26.553 --> 15:29.921
Except the first one
that they used.

15:29.989 --> 15:33.124
They went back and forth
through that clock

15:33.193 --> 15:34.193
all summer, right?

15:34.260 --> 15:36.327
- Mm-hmm.
- Until their mother died

15:36.396 --> 15:39.130
and their uncle
sold all their stuff.

15:39.199 --> 15:42.833
Um, I think I saw it.

15:42.902 --> 15:45.503
<i>At my Yale interview.</i>

15:45.572 --> 15:49.874
It was the same one
as the one on the cover.

15:49.943 --> 15:54.812
I mean, the guy died.
They--they probably sold it off,

15:54.881 --> 15:58.649
but what if, um,
what if the clock I saw

15:58.718 --> 16:00.985
was <i> the</i> clock?

16:04.591 --> 16:08.893
Why the --ck are you taking
a nap instead of looking for me?

16:08.962 --> 16:11.229
Margo?

16:11.297 --> 16:12.830
I-I thought you were banished.

16:12.899 --> 16:16.133
No, dumbass, I'm stuck
in the Fairy Realm.

16:16.202 --> 16:19.136
How can I see you?

16:19.205 --> 16:22.440
Oh, shit, she must've
mixed in the wrong strain.

16:22.508 --> 16:24.208
We wanted
"bang like happy pandas,"

16:24.277 --> 16:25.943
not "see other worlds."

16:26.012 --> 16:28.212
Never let an amateur
pack your bong, okay?

16:28.281 --> 16:31.148
Listen, dipshit,
you have to find Rafe,

16:31.217 --> 16:33.618
the squirrely little prick
who works for the sloth.

16:33.686 --> 16:36.621
He got me here.
He can get me back.

16:36.689 --> 16:37.622
You could say "please."

16:37.690 --> 16:39.557
No, I literally could not.

16:39.626 --> 16:40.891
I'm gonna go find Fen.

16:40.960 --> 16:44.195
You find a goddamn way
to get me back.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.963
Okay.

16:46.032 --> 16:47.164
Pretty sure this is it.

16:47.233 --> 16:48.366
Book statue.

16:48.434 --> 16:50.234
Not the most imaginative,
those librarians.

16:50.303 --> 16:52.803
Yeah, but not stupid.
Look at this cover.

16:55.341 --> 16:56.641
And locked.

16:56.709 --> 16:58.809
I've never seen
anything like this.

16:58.878 --> 17:02.947
Six-stage Vermel
anti-tampering enchantment.

17:03.016 --> 17:04.582
I can crack it.

17:15.361 --> 17:16.993
Pretty varsity...

17:17.063 --> 17:18.496
For a kid.

17:18.564 --> 17:20.097
My dad's a good teacher.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.266
All right,
so who pissed him off?

17:22.335 --> 17:24.602
You're going to a lot of trouble
to get at some of the most

17:24.671 --> 17:26.704
powerful battle magic
in the universe.

17:26.772 --> 17:28.372
Somebody's about to
have a bad day.

17:28.441 --> 17:30.074
I know it's hard for men
to imagine women

17:30.143 --> 17:32.476
having their own reasons
for doing anything,

17:32.545 --> 17:35.012
but I'm looking for my own book.

17:35.081 --> 17:37.748
I've been hidden away
in a library for the last year.

17:37.817 --> 17:40.451
No TV, no Wi-Fi,
had to find some way

17:40.520 --> 17:44.221
to entertain myself, so
I started reading Kanye's book.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.357
By the way,
he's really misunderstood.

17:46.426 --> 17:48.559
Anyway, right in the middle
of a sex scene,

17:48.628 --> 17:50.294
the book just stopped.

17:50.363 --> 17:51.762
Kanye dies during sex?

17:51.831 --> 17:53.030
That's the weird part.

17:53.099 --> 17:56.033
There were 20 more pages,
all blank.

17:56.102 --> 17:57.601
It's a glitch, right?

17:57.670 --> 18:00.971
But then, every other book
I checked of somebody alive

18:01.040 --> 18:04.342
right now
ends in 20 blank pages.

18:06.579 --> 18:08.813
The Order's known about it
for years--they call it

18:08.881 --> 18:12.416
the Great Blank Spot, some kind
of cataclysmic badness.

18:12.485 --> 18:13.918
Well, what causes it?

18:13.986 --> 18:15.553
They don't know,
just that it happens soon,

18:15.621 --> 18:18.055
like, weeks.

18:21.928 --> 18:23.361
How is reading
your book gonna help?

18:23.429 --> 18:25.229
Something happens
that affects the library,

18:25.298 --> 18:28.265
it'll be in a librarian's book,
but right now,

18:28.334 --> 18:30.000
they're moving
all the librarians' books

18:30.069 --> 18:32.336
to the Poison Room,
including mine.

18:32.405 --> 18:34.772
The Order thinks that
once your book is written,

18:34.841 --> 18:36.073
your fate is sealed.

18:36.142 --> 18:37.475
Well, I've never seen
a book be wrong.

18:37.543 --> 18:39.677
- You?
- No, but I saw them

18:39.746 --> 18:42.880
reshelve your book 39 times.

18:42.949 --> 18:44.949
Time loops exist,
then I'm team Sarah Connor:

18:45.017 --> 18:46.317
"No fate but what we make."

18:46.386 --> 18:48.419
Fine,
I'll grab your book for you.

18:48.488 --> 18:49.787
I can get it myself.

18:49.856 --> 18:51.655
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're not coming.

18:51.724 --> 18:55.159
How are you gonna get back?
I can't travel anyone with me.

18:55.228 --> 18:58.028
Think this is my first time
fountain spelunking?

19:10.510 --> 19:14.312
Well, fountain didn't
drop us in a lava pit,

19:14.348 --> 19:18.016
so we've got that going for us.

19:30.764 --> 19:32.430
When they named it
the Poison Room, how literal

19:32.466 --> 19:34.599
do you think they were being?

19:34.635 --> 19:37.068
Let's just do this fast.

19:37.104 --> 19:38.104
Yeah.

19:43.810 --> 19:45.143
Coming in on the weekend.

19:45.178 --> 19:47.112
Now, that is work ethic.

19:48.282 --> 19:51.082
I was hoping to run into you,
actually.

19:51.118 --> 19:55.420
I, uh, have questions,
and I would appreciate

19:55.455 --> 20:00.325
some fatherly guidance.

20:00.360 --> 20:03.094
I'd like that too.

20:03.130 --> 20:05.597
Here.

20:05.632 --> 20:08.600
It struck me that I've missed
a lot of birthdays.

20:08.635 --> 20:09.935
Open it.

20:16.176 --> 20:18.443
N--what is--?

20:18.478 --> 20:21.513
You went back to the witches.

20:21.548 --> 20:22.881
Where is she?

20:22.916 --> 20:24.849
Where's my wife?

20:24.885 --> 20:29.054
Oh, here and there.

20:29.089 --> 20:31.656
I saved you the biggest piece.

20:38.131 --> 20:39.965
Are you still trying
to be a good person?

20:40.000 --> 20:42.133
As if there is such a thing.

20:42.169 --> 20:47.038
Left alone, you would fight
and fight against your nature.

20:47.074 --> 20:50.241
And you would waste so much
of what you really are.

20:50.277 --> 20:55.747
If you think doing this
is going to turn me into you,

20:55.782 --> 20:58.683
you don't understand
people at all.

20:58.719 --> 21:01.319
I've been at it a long time.

21:01.355 --> 21:03.588
Well, look at Julia.

21:03.623 --> 21:06.157
I put a tiny black spot
on her soul,

21:06.193 --> 21:10.562
and she scrubbed at it so much
she put a hole in it.

21:10.597 --> 21:13.031
She can never go back
to who she is.

21:13.066 --> 21:14.566
Now...

21:14.601 --> 21:16.568
neither can you.

21:18.905 --> 21:23.274
This is an investment

21:23.310 --> 21:25.710
in our future, son.

21:25.746 --> 21:27.245
Someday,

21:27.280 --> 21:32.450
when you've embraced
what you really are,

21:32.486 --> 21:35.253
you'll come find me.

21:58.011 --> 21:59.878
Can I help you?

21:59.913 --> 22:03.982
Hi, we're looking for a clock.

22:04.017 --> 22:06.184
It belonged to my grandfather.

22:06.219 --> 22:09.854
The auction website,
it listed this address.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.556
Auction websites don't do that.

22:11.591 --> 22:13.024
Ugh, fine.

22:13.060 --> 22:16.027
We bribed the webmaster.

22:16.063 --> 22:18.630
The clock's got a lot
of sentimental value, so.

22:18.665 --> 22:20.532
Sorry, there's no clock here.

22:20.567 --> 22:24.536
"The clock was an unremarkable
thing on its surface.

22:24.571 --> 22:27.072
"To keep his mind off
the troubles of war and family,

22:27.107 --> 22:30.875
"Martin set out to repair
its inner workings,

22:30.911 --> 22:34.712
"and in place
of a mechanical heart..."

22:35.749 --> 22:38.950
"He found a new world."

22:38.985 --> 22:41.519
That's my favorite chapter
in the book.

22:45.258 --> 22:47.025
Holy shit, there are two of you.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.460
- Don't touch that.
- Oh.

22:48.495 --> 22:49.461
Please, put that down.

22:49.496 --> 22:51.963
Sorry, okay.

22:53.867 --> 22:55.633
Is that...?

22:55.669 --> 22:59.637
A screenplay for the failed
1983 feature film adaptation.

22:59.673 --> 23:01.306
There was a "Fillory" movie?

23:01.341 --> 23:03.741
No, the studio wouldn't
pay for the talking bears,

23:03.777 --> 23:06.311
so the director,
he quit in protest.

23:06.346 --> 23:08.813
Can I?

23:08.849 --> 23:10.715
Yeah.

23:10.750 --> 23:15.153
Q, uh, I found Grampy's clock.

23:15.188 --> 23:17.122
Wait, they changed
the Chatwins...

23:17.157 --> 23:18.723
Skateboarding Americans.

23:18.758 --> 23:20.291
I know, a travesty.

23:20.327 --> 23:22.026
And they got Jane
completely wrong.

23:22.062 --> 23:25.663
A girl that timid could never
grow up to be a Watcherwoman.

23:25.699 --> 23:28.633
Okay, real talk, I'll give you
$1,000 for the clock.

23:28.668 --> 23:29.901
It's a collector's item.

23:29.936 --> 23:32.003
- $20,000.
- It's not for sale.

23:32.038 --> 23:36.975
Wait, the books never said
who the Watcherwoman is.

23:39.446 --> 23:43.414
Well, it's--
it's not hard to deduce.

23:43.450 --> 23:46.050
Anyone who's always wearing
a hood is clearly

23:46.086 --> 23:49.554
a character you've met before.

23:49.589 --> 23:51.823
You know, don't you?

23:51.858 --> 23:56.728
That it's all real.
You--you've been to Fillory.

23:58.632 --> 24:00.298
Been to Fillory.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.467
Even in Fillory
the Watcherwoman's identity

24:02.502 --> 24:03.635
is a secret.
Who are you?

24:03.670 --> 24:06.204
Oh, my God, Q.

24:06.239 --> 24:08.773
He has horns.

24:08.808 --> 24:11.242
Like Ember, like,
just like Ember.

24:11.278 --> 24:12.844
What?

24:12.879 --> 24:15.013
Oh.

24:18.885 --> 24:22.320
Holy shit.

24:22.355 --> 24:23.321
Umber?

24:23.356 --> 24:25.523
In the flesh.

24:27.449 --> 24:31.274
Are they in the eye of...
What even is that?

24:31.342 --> 24:32.742
Lightning storm, huge.

24:32.810 --> 24:36.579
Happened every time Persephone
ascended from the Underworld.

24:36.647 --> 24:38.013
She used to come every spring.

24:38.082 --> 24:41.584
Now, decades, no pattern,
no trace.

24:41.652 --> 24:45.287
Except these modern accounts
show four storms stretch across

24:45.356 --> 24:47.723
the entire swath
of Southern Europe,

24:47.792 --> 24:51.227
and, smack in the center,
Murs, France.

24:52.730 --> 24:55.030
So we just need
to kick up a light storm,

24:55.099 --> 24:56.966
- a few twisters.
- And Reynard will think

24:57.034 --> 24:58.434
Our Lady is on Earth.

24:58.503 --> 25:00.035
He'll come running.

25:00.104 --> 25:01.036
Yeah.

25:04.809 --> 25:05.741
Are you okay?

25:05.810 --> 25:09.645
I...I need a drink.

25:19.590 --> 25:21.457
How was spell practice?

25:21.526 --> 25:23.859
I can barely make a spark.
I thought you said it'd be easy.

25:23.928 --> 25:25.461
You know, no pressure
or anything--

25:25.530 --> 25:28.564
Do you ever think about
where you'd be if he hadn't--

25:28.633 --> 25:30.900
Raped me?

25:31.903 --> 25:35.704
No, I try to focus on who I was.

25:35.773 --> 25:39.442
It's getting harder, though.

25:39.510 --> 25:42.411
Reynard thinks he broke you,
that there's no coming back

25:42.480 --> 25:43.646
from what he did.

25:43.714 --> 25:45.848
Do you think that's true?

25:45.917 --> 25:47.516
I hope not.

25:47.585 --> 25:52.755
Well, whatever happens,
don't let him be right.

25:58.763 --> 26:03.032
I think you should
go get some pizza.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.401
Okay.

26:12.477 --> 26:13.876
Food run.

26:13.945 --> 26:18.047
Listen, I wish we had time
to talk this through,

26:18.115 --> 26:20.449
but ultimately,
I know you'd agree with me.

26:20.518 --> 26:22.818
What are you talking about?

26:22.887 --> 26:25.521
Ahh, ahh, oh, my wards.

26:25.590 --> 26:26.789
I'm sorry.

26:26.858 --> 26:29.925
Why, why are you
doing this to me?

26:29.994 --> 26:33.128
After everything
Julia's been through,

26:33.197 --> 26:34.663
I can't make her do this.

26:34.732 --> 26:36.832
Do what?

26:39.003 --> 26:42.304
This is very good.

26:42.373 --> 26:43.105
Tea?

26:43.174 --> 26:47.042
I don't have time.

26:47.111 --> 26:49.678
Ah, brilliant,
the shortcut there--

26:49.747 --> 26:52.047
I don't have time.

26:54.051 --> 26:57.686
I understood everything,
and now it's fading like a dream

26:57.755 --> 26:59.989
that you woke me from.

27:00.057 --> 27:01.590
Why can't I do magic?

27:01.659 --> 27:03.158
You're newborn again.

27:03.227 --> 27:05.127
You must crawl then walk.

27:05.196 --> 27:06.529
How long?

27:06.597 --> 27:08.163
What's the rush?

27:09.567 --> 27:13.736
I'm stuck in this--
this oily, disgusting cage,

27:13.804 --> 27:16.305
and I--I can't even fucking see.
I can't do anything.

27:16.374 --> 27:18.214
On the contrary,
you're finally in a position

27:18.242 --> 27:20.676
- to do something interesting.
- Fuck you, what do you know?

27:20.745 --> 27:25.915
I know, as niffin, you care
about nothing but your own mind,

27:25.983 --> 27:28.684
so congratulations,
a perfect life

27:28.753 --> 27:33.122
with zero meaning.
Now as human--

27:33.190 --> 27:35.791
Humans are weak pieces of shit.

27:45.236 --> 27:48.938
Do you know what magic is?

27:49.006 --> 27:51.974
Energy capable of making
this shithole world

27:52.043 --> 27:55.878
one fractional speck
less unbearable

27:55.947 --> 27:59.882
because we shits
try so fucking hard,

27:59.951 --> 28:04.353
and that--that is not weakness.
Believe me.

28:04.422 --> 28:07.489
You don't like this world?
Good, you see its faults.

28:07.558 --> 28:13.162
It gives you focus and solitude
to actually fix it.

28:19.470 --> 28:21.737
Adderall, to fortify you.

28:21.806 --> 28:24.506
Makes you write like Tolstoy.

28:24.575 --> 28:27.910
Don't make face.

28:27.979 --> 28:30.079
Drugs are fun.

28:40.191 --> 28:42.291
Hey, I wasn't sure
what kind you wanted,

28:42.360 --> 28:45.294
so, I don't know, I--

28:50.368 --> 28:52.001
Oh, my God.

28:56.007 --> 28:58.374
He made--he made me.

28:58.442 --> 28:59.775
What?

28:59.844 --> 29:02.578
He made me do the ritual.

29:02.647 --> 29:04.780
Collect his--his power.

29:06.851 --> 29:08.283
Oh, my God.

29:10.021 --> 29:13.756
Hey, you get yourself
cleaned up,

29:13.824 --> 29:16.925
and I'll handle the rest, okay?

29:23.968 --> 29:26.201
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

29:26.270 --> 29:27.503
Ah.

29:37.281 --> 29:39.148
Sylvia, where are you?
Sylvia!

29:39.216 --> 29:40.416
Sylvia, read it
when you get back.

29:40.484 --> 29:42.117
We gotta go.

29:43.921 --> 29:45.020
You betrayed Ember.

29:45.089 --> 29:46.588
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

29:46.657 --> 29:48.057
I just had no choice.

29:48.125 --> 29:49.658
It was a matter of survival.

29:49.727 --> 29:52.494
A condition of the agreement
I made with Martin Chatwin.

29:52.563 --> 29:54.363
He had Fillory
booby-trapped to the gills.

29:54.432 --> 29:55.864
He was about to fillet me.

29:55.933 --> 29:59.435
So you faked your own death,
and you moved to Vancouver?

29:59.503 --> 30:01.103
Well, if I had to leave Fillory,

30:01.172 --> 30:03.105
Canada was the obvious
second choice.

30:03.174 --> 30:07.376
What is it that
you enjoy about Fillory?

30:07.445 --> 30:11.180
Uh...it reminds me of a time

30:11.248 --> 30:13.716
before I realized
how shitty being an adult is.

30:13.784 --> 30:15.184
And there's opium in the air.

30:15.252 --> 30:17.653
And how do you feel
about turtles?

30:17.722 --> 30:19.388
Indifferent, I guess.

30:19.457 --> 30:20.689
Not a fan.

30:20.758 --> 30:23.158
Would you sleep easier
knowing that your entire world

30:23.227 --> 30:25.894
rested on the back
of one or several?

30:25.963 --> 30:28.063
What--why are you asking?

30:28.132 --> 30:30.532
Because as visitors
to my previous work,

30:30.601 --> 30:35.137
you make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

30:35.206 --> 30:38.107
It's something
I've been building.

30:38.175 --> 30:39.775
Testing a few things out.

30:39.844 --> 30:43.011
It's more of a pocket world,
really.

30:44.715 --> 30:47.149
I call it Cuba.

30:47.218 --> 30:48.650
That's already a place.

30:48.719 --> 30:49.752
- Is it?
- Yes.

30:49.820 --> 30:51.620
- You're sure?
- Absolutely sure.

30:51.689 --> 30:54.490
Oh, damn it.

30:54.558 --> 30:57.259
Look, this is all
very interesting-ish,

30:57.328 --> 30:59.628
but I have a kingdom to fix.

31:06.670 --> 31:08.904
You were never
meant to fix Fillory.

31:08.973 --> 31:10.005
Of course I was.

31:10.074 --> 31:11.274
No, you were meant to entertain

31:11.308 --> 31:14.076
like some reality TV star.

31:14.145 --> 31:16.845
Oh, Ember must've
found you so boring.

31:16.914 --> 31:18.480
Boring?

31:18.549 --> 31:22.785
Fillory was created out of
the unification of opposites.

31:22.853 --> 31:26.255
Ember is a creature
of entropy and chaos--

31:26.323 --> 31:29.158
And you have every season
of "Law & Order" on DVD.

31:29.226 --> 31:32.494
The most perfect show
in creation.

31:32.563 --> 31:35.831
When Ember and I were together,
there was balance.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.900
Without me, chaos reigns.

31:37.968 --> 31:39.935
Give up, Children of Earth.

31:40.004 --> 31:42.004
Fillory cannot be ruled.

31:50.948 --> 31:51.980
Whoa.

31:52.049 --> 31:53.549
Come on.

31:53.617 --> 31:55.417
Stop worrying about me.
Fucking travel out already.

31:55.486 --> 31:57.252
Look, I will carry
your ass back by--

31:57.321 --> 31:59.221
You don't get it!

32:00.324 --> 32:03.725
I don't make it
back to the rope.

32:03.794 --> 32:05.828
My book didn't have
a blank spot.

32:05.896 --> 32:07.429
So what?

32:07.498 --> 32:09.231
What happened to "there's
no fate but what we make"?

32:09.300 --> 32:12.034
If you carry me back,
you die too, Penny.

32:12.102 --> 32:13.535
I read it.

32:13.604 --> 32:16.805
Leaving me is the only way
you have a chance.

32:26.817 --> 32:28.183
- Penny.
- I got your book.

32:28.252 --> 32:29.885
What the hell?

32:29.954 --> 32:31.220
Penny?
Oh, my--

32:31.288 --> 32:33.188
Help!

32:33.257 --> 32:34.857
Give me good news, Rafe.

32:34.925 --> 32:37.659
Unfortunately, returning
from the Fairy Realm

32:37.728 --> 32:39.828
is, uh, problematic.

32:39.897 --> 32:43.498
All I have is this tincture
that takes you there.

32:43.567 --> 32:44.967
Why would I drink this?

32:45.035 --> 32:47.002
Then I'm stuck there
with Margo, and you can't

32:47.071 --> 32:48.303
get either of us out.

32:48.372 --> 32:50.138
Prince Ess of Loria,
Your Majesty.

32:50.207 --> 32:51.640
Where's my father?

32:51.709 --> 32:54.042
Hey, I don't think
we've formally met.

32:54.111 --> 32:55.410
Cut the shit.

32:55.479 --> 32:57.479
I will tear this place apart
if I have to.

32:57.548 --> 33:03.285
So uh, funny story, uh,
your--your dad is actually

33:03.354 --> 33:04.920
a rat person now.

33:04.989 --> 33:07.089
- Do it.
- He's--

33:20.804 --> 33:22.537
Break it down.

33:23.941 --> 33:25.908
Hakuna matata has failed me.

33:28.900 --> 33:31.945
It pains me, but I simply
cannot go back to Fillory.

33:32.452 --> 33:36.555
So you're just gonna let Ember
turn Fillory into a telenovela?

33:36.590 --> 33:39.057
Well, you don't understand
how he is.

33:39.092 --> 33:41.193
He pitted animals
against each other

33:41.228 --> 33:44.296
by offering only the sexiest
the ability to speak.

33:44.331 --> 33:46.865
Centaurs?
Drunk off his chair, obviously.

33:46.900 --> 33:50.535
When he gets snacky, he talks
about turning humans into rats.

33:50.571 --> 33:53.071
Holy shit.

33:53.106 --> 33:54.873
Ember turned everybody
into rats.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.308
Oh, he finally did it.

33:56.343 --> 33:58.476
That's been on his bucket list
for centuries.

33:58.512 --> 34:00.612
Ember cock-blocked me.

34:00.647 --> 34:03.582
You are a god of Fillory.

34:03.617 --> 34:05.884
Why are you just sitting here
and letting your brother

34:05.919 --> 34:07.385
shit all over it?

34:07.421 --> 34:08.954
You let The Beast happen.

34:08.989 --> 34:12.389
You shut out a child
who needed shelter,

34:12.426 --> 34:16.293
and when he became a monster,
you ran.

34:16.330 --> 34:18.295
You hate chaos?

34:18.331 --> 34:22.467
Then fix the chaos
that you created.

34:27.741 --> 34:29.241
You're right.

34:29.275 --> 34:32.210
But some mistakes
cannot be repaired.

34:32.246 --> 34:34.779
And from those,
we must move forward.

34:34.815 --> 34:36.848
And I shall try
to avoid repeating

34:36.884 --> 34:40.252
such mistakes in my new world.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.020
Fine...

34:44.091 --> 34:45.422
Then give us the clock.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.692
Why do you care?

34:47.728 --> 34:49.594
Fillory's on its last legs.

34:49.630 --> 34:52.664
Everything you've said tells me
Ember is tired of the game.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.233
He's likely to smash the place
like a toddler.

34:55.268 --> 34:58.203
Trust me, that'll be it.
End of Fillory.

34:58.238 --> 34:59.971
And don't get sentimental.

35:00.007 --> 35:01.606
We aren't ready
to walk away yet.

35:01.642 --> 35:03.775
We know you still love Fillory.

35:03.810 --> 35:07.879
You literally have
every memento to prove it.

35:07.915 --> 35:09.614
If you can't fix it
or won't save it,

35:09.650 --> 35:13.351
then let us try.

35:13.387 --> 35:15.320
Please.

35:16.890 --> 35:18.924
You love Fillory.

35:18.959 --> 35:21.159
It's my home.

35:23.230 --> 35:27.365
Then the clock is yours,
Your Majesty.

35:27.401 --> 35:30.435
But heed my warning.

35:30.470 --> 35:35.640
Nothing entertains Ember more
than a whimsical death.

35:58.999 --> 36:00.765
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:00.801 --> 36:04.202
How's Penny?
Still alive?

36:04.237 --> 36:06.905
I could've worded that better.

36:06.940 --> 36:10.275
Yeah.

36:10.310 --> 36:12.978
They cleared out
the whole infirmary.

36:13.013 --> 36:15.013
Something about radiation.

36:15.048 --> 36:16.314
That can't be good.

36:16.350 --> 36:18.049
And not much I can do about it
right now.

36:18.085 --> 36:20.185
So you've got time.

36:20.220 --> 36:23.355
Kill it with me killing Reynard.

36:24.324 --> 36:26.257
Good news,
found a spell in here.

36:26.293 --> 36:29.861
Turns metal objects
into god-piercing weapons.

36:29.896 --> 36:34.299
And if it can
be anything, gun, right?

36:34.334 --> 36:39.037
But it took everything John
gave us just to make one bullet.

36:39.072 --> 36:42.540
So we've got one shot.

36:56.523 --> 36:57.355
Fall back.

36:57.391 --> 37:00.825
Don't inhale the...smoke...

37:16.009 --> 37:21.212
Oh, shit.

37:21.248 --> 37:24.349
Luckily, I'm a pro.
Come on, come on.

37:27.421 --> 37:28.319
Fen?

37:28.355 --> 37:30.922
- Josh, you can see me?
- Fen!

37:30.957 --> 37:33.892
Josh, help me!
Help me, please, hurry!

37:37.097 --> 37:40.665
Tick, tell my story.

38:01.688 --> 38:03.088
Well, this is it.

38:04.391 --> 38:06.724
The sign Reynard's
been waiting for.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.793
Come on out, asshole.

38:08.829 --> 38:14.065
Something feels so right about
tricking him with goddess omens.

38:14.101 --> 38:15.200
Amen.

38:15.235 --> 38:16.534
Let's get scarce.

38:16.570 --> 38:18.069
Let's go.

38:33.487 --> 38:35.153
I know you're here.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.021
There he is.

38:37.057 --> 38:40.024
The lightning, the wind...

38:40.060 --> 38:43.027
Always were a drama queen.

38:44.197 --> 38:47.065
I can't get a clear shot.

38:52.339 --> 38:53.671
Go on the other side.

38:53.707 --> 38:56.674
- I'll get you a clear shot.
- Kady!

38:56.710 --> 38:58.109
Hey!

38:59.913 --> 39:01.646
I should have known.

39:01.681 --> 39:02.780
Where's Julia?

39:02.816 --> 39:06.151
Why don't you ask me
where John is?

39:08.121 --> 39:09.954
What did you do?

39:09.990 --> 39:11.923
Nothing he wasn't asking for.

39:11.958 --> 39:14.859
Hated you so much,
he begged me to kill him.

39:14.895 --> 39:16.161
You bitch!

39:16.196 --> 39:17.162
You liar!

39:29.075 --> 39:31.509
Kady, what...?

39:47.265 --> 39:50.800
It's you.

39:50.835 --> 39:55.271
You ignored us,
and now you're here?

39:55.307 --> 39:57.974
All of a sudden?

39:58.009 --> 39:59.942
Why?

39:59.978 --> 40:03.446
To ask you to spare his life.

40:03.481 --> 40:04.781
I don't understand.

40:04.816 --> 40:07.650
Why do you care?

40:07.686 --> 40:09.986
He's my son.

40:14.259 --> 40:16.859
Did you know what he was doing?

40:19.964 --> 40:22.799
Of course you did.

40:22.834 --> 40:25.234
He raped me.

40:25.270 --> 40:27.136
Your son.

40:27.172 --> 40:30.973
I'd be sobbing
and telling you every detail,

40:31.009 --> 40:33.009
but I lost my Shade
in the abortion,

40:33.044 --> 40:37.347
so you're just gonna have to
take my word for it.

40:37.382 --> 40:38.948
Let me deal with him.

40:38.983 --> 40:41.150
Why would I trust you?
Come the fuck on, lady.

40:41.186 --> 40:43.720
There are consequences
to killing a god, Julia.

40:43.755 --> 40:46.823
I lost my friends.
I lost everything.

40:46.858 --> 40:50.560
He turned me into a monster.

40:50.595 --> 40:53.196
You're a survivor.

40:55.834 --> 40:58.201
You're still capable of mercy,
Julia.

40:58.236 --> 41:01.738
Don't let him rob you of that.

41:10.849 --> 41:13.216
It's your choice.

41:38.510 --> 41:44.180
I am so disappointed
with what you've done.

41:44.215 --> 41:48.317
You left me.
<i>You</i> left me.

41:48.353 --> 41:51.521
Well, I am back.

41:51.556 --> 41:54.290
And it's time to go.

41:55.627 --> 41:58.327
No, no!

41:58.363 --> 42:03.533
How could you do this after
everything we've been through?

42:03.568 --> 42:05.868
I killed John for this.

42:05.904 --> 42:07.136
It was the right thing.

42:07.172 --> 42:10.306
How the hell
would you know that?

42:11.476 --> 42:13.276
Sorry, Kady.

42:37.969 --> 42:40.570
Our Lady sent me.

43:00.658 --> 43:03.125
Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

43:07.799 --> 43:10.266
I tried to do the right thing.

43:14.239 --> 43:15.905
But I'm not sorry
that you're alive,

43:15.940 --> 43:18.774
and maybe that makes me selfish,
but I...

43:20.245 --> 43:23.913
The world's a better place
when you're in it.

43:26.351 --> 43:29.852
Say the word, and I'll stay.

43:32.624 --> 43:35.291
If you want me to leave you
alone for a while

43:35.326 --> 43:37.827
and figure this out on your own,
I mean, let's face it.

43:37.862 --> 43:40.096
There's probably nothing
that you can't figure out.

43:40.131 --> 43:42.832
You are Alice Quinn.

43:52.877 --> 43:56.612
Okay, so the plan so far is,

43:56.648 --> 43:59.048
find a way to stay in Fillory

43:59.083 --> 44:01.150
and never get banished again.

44:01.185 --> 44:05.054
Find a way to stop Ember or
drive him out or, I don't know,

44:05.089 --> 44:08.157
anything but letting him
get so bored he decides

44:08.192 --> 44:10.693
to just shake the Etch A Sketch
and end our kingdom,

44:10.728 --> 44:13.296
everyone I care about, and
the well spring in the process.

44:13.331 --> 44:16.098
So, thoughts?

44:16.134 --> 44:19.368
You're talking about
conquering Fillory.

44:19.404 --> 44:20.736
For its own good.

44:20.772 --> 44:25.508
Your plan is the exact same
as The Beast's was.

44:25.543 --> 44:27.443
Shit.

44:30.949 --> 44:33.007
Do you got a better idea?

44:33.267 --> 44:35.187
