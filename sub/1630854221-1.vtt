00:52.687 --> 00:53.851
- Lucy?

00:53.886 --> 00:56.161
Lucy, I need to
borrow your phone.

00:56.196 --> 00:56.995
- What, why?

00:58.396 --> 00:59.725
I said, why do you
need to borrow it.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.924
- Mine's dead.

01:00.959 --> 01:02.200
- So charge it.

01:02.235 --> 01:03.696
- I am, but it's
taking too long,

01:03.731 --> 01:06.567
and I need to know how many
likes I've got on my post.

01:06.602 --> 01:08.272
- Oh my God, you're obsessed.

01:08.307 --> 01:10.340
- Says the one with
10,000 followers.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.869
I'm surprised you're
not on there, anyway.

01:11.904 --> 01:13.772
- I'm waiting for a
phone call actually.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.807
- Fine, please, can
you check it for me?

01:20.517 --> 01:24.156
- It's had 78 likes, so far.

01:24.191 --> 01:24.849
- Not bad.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.787
- While my latest
post has over 3,000.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.459
- Shut up.

01:30.494 --> 01:32.263
Who are you waiting for
a phone call from anyway,

01:32.298 --> 01:33.759
that game show?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.464
- Yes, the game show.

01:35.499 --> 01:36.894
It's called The Game of Love.

01:36.929 --> 01:38.797
- So you think
you're gonna get in?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.304
- I think so.

01:40.339 --> 01:41.833
Anyway, you're not
allowed to watch.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.571
- Why not?

01:43.606 --> 01:46.772
- Well, because I might be
enjoying some activities,

01:46.807 --> 01:48.741
which I'd rather my
sister didn't see.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.281
- You're actually
willing to do stuff

01:50.316 --> 01:51.942
while people are watching?

01:51.977 --> 01:52.976
- Ah, yeah.

01:53.011 --> 01:54.351
If it helps me win.

01:56.014 --> 01:57.420
- But why?

01:57.455 --> 01:59.917
- Because I can't stay
at home forever, can I?

02:02.328 --> 02:03.162
- Oh.

02:06.024 --> 02:07.199
- Hello?

02:08.026 --> 02:09.630
Yes, speaking.

02:12.569 --> 02:13.964
Oh, wow.

02:15.737 --> 02:17.506
That is such a shock.

02:18.377 --> 02:20.509
Uh, yes.

02:20.544 --> 02:21.741
Yeah.

02:21.776 --> 02:22.610
Okay.

02:24.581 --> 02:27.549
I'll see you next
week, okay bye.

03:20.703 --> 03:21.537
- Thanks.

04:04.747 --> 04:06.813
- Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

04:07.717 --> 04:08.518
- Oh, hello.

04:08.553 --> 04:09.453
- I'm Jasmine.

04:09.488 --> 04:10.718
- Lucy, nice to meet you.

04:11.721 --> 04:13.083
- I'm Naomi.

04:13.118 --> 04:14.755
- Oh hi, Lucy.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.824
- You're really pretty.

04:17.859 --> 04:19.595
- Oh, thank you.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.597
- Naomi was hoping
you'd be a boy.

04:21.632 --> 04:23.093
- I wasn't hoping.

04:23.128 --> 04:25.304
I just thought they might
mix it up a little bit.

04:26.538 --> 04:27.999
- Well, this place
definitely looks bigger

04:28.034 --> 04:29.737
from the outside, doesn't it?

04:29.772 --> 04:30.672
- Yeah.

04:30.707 --> 04:31.739
I thought so, too.

04:32.874 --> 04:35.710
- Well, you ladies
found the bedrooms yet?

04:35.745 --> 04:37.316
- Oh yeah, they're upstairs.

04:38.550 --> 04:39.747
- Let's show you.

04:39.782 --> 04:40.616
- Cool.

04:43.456 --> 04:46.358
- Well, Jasmine and I have
already chosen our rooms,

04:46.393 --> 04:48.085
'cause well, I got here first,

04:48.120 --> 04:50.120
so I thought I'd
pick the one I like.

04:52.432 --> 04:54.058
- Well, which ones are free?

04:55.127 --> 04:56.401
Are there any more upstairs?

04:56.436 --> 04:58.700
- Yeah, I'm sure
there's more upstairs.

04:58.735 --> 04:59.569
- Okay.

05:08.173 --> 05:11.944
- You don't even
have a proper window.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.981
- Oh, it's okay, I'm
not here for the views.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.985
- So how many of us do
you think will be playing?

05:21.186 --> 05:23.054
- There's gonna be a few, right?

05:23.089 --> 05:26.728
- Well, if there's 10 rooms,
maybe there's 10 of us.

05:28.226 --> 05:30.798
- What kind of tasks do you
think they'll want us to do?

05:32.230 --> 05:35.374
- Well, all sorts I expect.

05:36.542 --> 05:39.103
- Is the show being
screened on TV?

05:39.138 --> 05:40.907
- I heard
it was only online.

05:40.942 --> 05:42.645
- Well for the money
we were playing for,

05:42.680 --> 05:44.383
I don't care where they show it.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.419
- You're playing win then?

05:47.454 --> 05:48.211
- Aren't we all?

05:48.246 --> 05:49.619
- Anyone up there.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.149
Hello?

05:53.185 --> 05:55.823
- The first boys,
right?

05:55.858 --> 05:57.990
- Wait, two boys at once.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.630
- Oh my God.

06:00.665 --> 06:01.796
This is so exciting.

06:01.831 --> 06:04.601
- But there's three of us.

06:04.636 --> 06:06.229
What does that mean?

06:06.264 --> 06:08.506
- I don't care, come on.

06:08.541 --> 06:11.168
Let's go and say
hello.

06:19.717 --> 06:21.211
Hello boys.

06:21.246 --> 06:22.421
- Hi.

06:23.281 --> 06:25.985
- God, this is so
exciting, isn't it?

06:26.020 --> 06:27.118
Hi, I'm Jasmine.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.725
- Hey I'm James, it's
nice to meet you.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.155
- Naomi.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.499
If you need help remembering
it's I moan backwards.

06:35.667 --> 06:36.996
- This is nice.

06:38.901 --> 06:40.901
- This is Luce.

06:40.936 --> 06:43.200
- Yeah hi, I'm Lucy.

06:43.235 --> 06:44.872
Nice to meet you.

06:44.907 --> 06:47.204
- Any more of you
girls upstairs?

06:47.239 --> 06:49.206
- It's just us.

06:49.241 --> 06:51.516
- Must be our lucky day, James.

06:51.551 --> 06:52.209
- Must be.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.521
- How come you both
arrived at the same time?

06:56.556 --> 06:58.050
- We were told to.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.183
- Producers said
that we are last ones

06:59.218 --> 07:00.954
to arrive today as well, so.

07:00.989 --> 07:02.824
- That means we're
all here then.

07:02.859 --> 07:06.498
- Today, more may
arrive tomorrow.

07:06.533 --> 07:07.532
- Great, let's have fun then,

07:07.567 --> 07:09.226
not stand around like lemons.

07:09.261 --> 07:10.964
- You are so right.

07:10.999 --> 07:13.164
- Well, bedrooms are upstairs
if you wanna drop your stuff,

07:13.199 --> 07:16.266
and while you do that, I'm
gonna find the alcohol.

07:16.301 --> 07:19.511
- Yeah, I could use a drink.

07:19.546 --> 07:22.206
- You girls go and
find the drinks,

07:22.241 --> 07:25.143
'cause I'm gonna take
the boys upstairs

07:25.178 --> 07:27.244
and show them their rooms.

07:29.820 --> 07:30.753
- Sounds good.

07:30.788 --> 07:32.249
- See you guys later.

07:33.285 --> 07:35.989
- I think the
kitchen's through here.

07:36.024 --> 07:38.794
- Perfect, must
be in the fridge.

07:40.666 --> 07:41.500
Oh.

07:44.868 --> 07:46.197
Hmm, jackpot.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.968
How do we feel about champagne?

07:48.806 --> 07:49.970
- I'll get the glasses.

08:05.757 --> 08:07.251
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:12.599 --> 08:15.028
Oh, that's nice.

08:15.063 --> 08:16.293
- Yeah.

08:16.328 --> 08:17.965
- Hey, you found the booze then.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.869
- It's not Dom Perignon or
anything, but it will do.

08:22.037 --> 08:23.707
- I wouldn't know,
I've never tried it.

08:23.742 --> 08:25.775
- Oh my
God, you should.

08:25.810 --> 08:29.614
- Just think I'll stick
to a beer to be fair.

08:29.649 --> 08:30.879
- The fridge behind you.

08:32.278 --> 08:35.213
- Do you drink a lot of
champagne then, do you, or?

08:36.414 --> 08:39.217
- Christmas, birthdays
usually, that sort of thing.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.826
- And where are you from?

08:44.994 --> 08:45.993
- Surrey.

08:46.028 --> 08:47.390
You?

08:47.425 --> 08:50.030
- Nottingham, where'd
you go to school?

08:51.066 --> 08:52.065
- You wouldn't know.

08:53.365 --> 08:54.606
- Try me.

08:54.641 --> 08:56.267
- Wisely School for Girls.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.005
- You went to an
all girls school?

08:58.040 --> 08:59.237
- Yeah, I mean, it's not like

08:59.272 --> 09:01.338
what you think in the
movies or anything.

09:01.373 --> 09:03.846
- It's like a private
school though, right?

09:05.311 --> 09:06.343
- Yeah, why?

09:06.378 --> 09:07.377
Are you-

09:08.688 --> 09:10.248
- Yes, champagne.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.723
Just what we need
to liven things up.

09:12.758 --> 09:14.318
Callum, champagne?

09:14.353 --> 09:15.352
- Can be very sure.

09:26.805 --> 09:27.903
- Here you go.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.369
- Here's to us,
first ones to arrive.

09:32.404 --> 09:33.337
- The OGs.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.371
- Woo.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.310
- Don't you look adorable?

09:39.345 --> 09:41.917
- I thought you said you
the last ones to arrive?

09:41.952 --> 09:44.722
- Oh, I'm not playing,
I'm the presenter.

09:44.757 --> 09:48.154
- Oh my God, is the
game starting now?

09:48.189 --> 09:50.794
- Actually the game started
the moment you walked in,

09:50.829 --> 09:54.094
but there are a few
things we need to go over.

09:54.129 --> 09:55.227
Join me in the lounge?

10:06.240 --> 10:09.879
To start, I want to
say how glad we are

10:09.914 --> 10:13.751
that you all decided to be
part of our little show.

10:13.786 --> 10:17.722
It's so exciting to have
you all here for our debut.

10:17.757 --> 10:22.023
As you know, the Game of Love
is being streamed online.

10:22.058 --> 10:24.487
There are cameras hidden
throughout the house,

10:24.522 --> 10:26.192
in all the rooms.

10:26.227 --> 10:28.161
Yes, even the washrooms.

10:28.196 --> 10:30.735
These have already
started recording.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.396
But as I said,

10:32.431 --> 10:35.003
there are a few details
that we need to go over

10:35.038 --> 10:37.368
before things really get going.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.876
One of those is these.

10:48.150 --> 10:50.381
These phones will be
incredibly important

10:50.416 --> 10:52.317
during your stay in the manor.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.992
They will be giving
you instructions
throughout the game.

10:57.027 --> 11:00.325
To help our viewers, these
phones have been set up

11:00.360 --> 11:03.460
with an automatic text
to speech service.

11:03.495 --> 11:08.498
So any messages you do
receive will be read out loud.

11:09.237 --> 11:10.533
Also, as you know,

11:10.568 --> 11:13.404
the Game of Love has

11:13.439 --> 11:18.310
a 250,000 pound cash prize
for the winning couple.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.917
It's a lot of cash.

11:22.349 --> 11:26.120
But, we wanna give you guys
a chance to increase that.

11:26.958 --> 11:28.353
As the game progresses,

11:28.388 --> 11:32.357
you will be given a variety
of tasks to complete.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.931
These will come
through to your phones.

11:34.966 --> 11:36.328
To mix things up,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.264
we are giving our
viewers the chance

11:38.299 --> 11:41.036
to send through
ideas and requests

11:41.071 --> 11:44.039
for you to complete
as these tasks.

11:44.074 --> 11:47.240
Viewers, make sure you click
on the link below the screen,

11:47.275 --> 11:49.506
have your credit card
available at hand,

11:49.541 --> 11:51.112
if you wanna send
through a request.

11:51.147 --> 11:54.115
The more challenging
the requests,

11:55.019 --> 11:57.514
the more money you will win.

11:57.549 --> 11:59.857
Finally, there will
be several couplings

11:59.892 --> 12:01.584
throughout the show.

12:01.619 --> 12:03.322
During these, you
have the chance

12:03.357 --> 12:08.360
to become an official
couple or stay a singleton,

12:09.528 --> 12:11.594
but here's where
things get tricky.

12:11.629 --> 12:14.300
There will be internal voting

12:14.335 --> 12:16.973
to see who stays in the manor.

12:17.008 --> 12:21.241
Singletons are safe
from elimination,

12:22.244 --> 12:23.848
but

12:23.883 --> 12:26.345
only a couple

12:26.380 --> 12:27.577
can win the game.

12:29.119 --> 12:30.118
Everyone with me?

12:31.550 --> 12:35.354
The last couple standing
is the winner of the game.

12:36.588 --> 12:41.459
So, before I go, we are
gonna do our first coupling.

12:42.198 --> 12:43.868
Callum, what will it be?

12:46.400 --> 12:47.432
- Singleton.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.841
- Naomi, what will it be?

12:49.876 --> 12:52.536
Couple up, or stay a singleton?

12:52.571 --> 12:53.504
- Singleton.

12:53.539 --> 12:56.177
- James, what will it be?

12:56.212 --> 12:58.850
Would you like to couple
up or stay a singleton?

12:58.885 --> 13:00.478
- I think I'll
stay at singleton.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.545
- Jasmine?

13:01.580 --> 13:02.579
What will it be?

13:02.614 --> 13:04.889
Couple up, or stay a singleton?

13:04.924 --> 13:06.121
- Singleton.

13:06.156 --> 13:07.584
- And Lucy?

13:08.895 --> 13:09.993
- Singleton.

13:10.028 --> 13:11.159
- Excellent.

13:11.194 --> 13:13.260
My work here is done.

13:13.295 --> 13:16.659
Welcome to The Game of Love.

13:16.694 --> 13:19.365
The game has officially begun.

13:34.118 --> 13:37.119
- That's a really cool, Callum.

13:37.154 --> 13:40.122
- Yeah, I mean, it's
really .

13:40.157 --> 13:44.489
Lot of people a lot of
businesses .

13:49.727 --> 13:51.100
- So why do you think

13:51.135 --> 13:52.563
they haven't given us
our challenges yet?

13:52.598 --> 13:55.940
- Dunno, just easing us in,
I guess, like warming us up.

13:55.975 --> 13:58.943
- I mean we could play
a game ourselves, guys.

14:00.210 --> 14:01.011
- I know.

14:02.278 --> 14:04.443
Spin the bottle.

14:04.478 --> 14:08.216
- No, certainly
not, what are we, 14?

14:15.720 --> 14:16.895
- Okay.

14:24.465 --> 14:25.266
- Me next.

14:33.144 --> 14:33.978
- Oh.

14:35.674 --> 14:36.607
- Hey guys.

14:47.719 --> 14:48.718
- My turn.

15:01.205 --> 15:02.336
- No.

15:02.371 --> 15:03.205
- What?

15:04.043 --> 15:05.339
- I'm not gonna kiss you.

15:05.374 --> 15:07.308
- Come on, mate.

15:07.343 --> 15:10.278
- What, she's not my type.

15:10.313 --> 15:11.543
- It's a game.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.346
- Yeah, well they're
not offering us cash

15:12.381 --> 15:13.347
for it now, are they?

15:13.382 --> 15:14.678
So what's the point?

15:15.914 --> 15:18.352
- All players,
please go to the games room.

15:22.061 --> 15:24.622
- Oh, I was in here
earlier, that wasn't there.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.723
Oh, somebody must've
came in and set it out

15:26.758 --> 15:28.329
while we were eating.

15:28.364 --> 15:30.397
- I am so excited.

15:30.432 --> 15:32.498
- Nice, this is together.

15:37.340 --> 15:38.539
Play strip poker.

15:38.575 --> 15:42.475
1000 pounds added to the prize
fund for each person playing.

15:42.510 --> 15:43.674
- Strip poker?

15:43.709 --> 15:45.280
Oh, what's that Callum?

15:45.315 --> 15:48.052
Scared you're gonna lose?

15:48.087 --> 15:49.218
- Not at all.

15:49.253 --> 15:50.681
Looking forward to
seeing you girls strip.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.320
- Go easy on me.

15:52.355 --> 15:54.619
- I'm not gonna
promise, darling.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.686
All right.

15:55.721 --> 15:56.720
I'll deal.

15:58.196 --> 16:03.133
All right.

16:06.435 --> 16:10.140
- Go on, go on Callum.

16:26.257 --> 16:27.091
- Three.

16:28.292 --> 16:33.295
No, come on.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.462
Okay.

17:00.324 --> 17:01.125
Can we?

18:04.586 --> 18:05.420
- Right.

18:05.455 --> 18:06.388
I'm done.

18:06.423 --> 18:07.818
I need to go to bed.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.391
- Oh, come on.

18:09.426 --> 18:11.789
Come on and finish it,
I want to see your tits.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.633
- Okay.

18:40.919 --> 18:41.819
- Come on.
- Take 'em off.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.524
- What's going on?

18:45.594 --> 18:48.265
- Socks do not
count in the game.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.365
- Of course they do.

18:49.400 --> 18:50.234
- No.

18:52.337 --> 18:54.832
- For fuck sakes then, I'm done.

18:58.277 --> 18:59.342
- Another round then?

19:01.907 --> 19:03.412
- Deals.

19:04.679 --> 19:05.678
Hey.

19:08.650 --> 19:13.653
Take them off, take
them off, take them off.

19:13.985 --> 19:14.450
- Hey.

19:18.924 --> 19:20.330
- 15,000
Pounds added to the prize fund

19:20.365 --> 19:21.694
if you have a threesome.

19:22.664 --> 19:24.730
- No fucking around.

19:24.765 --> 19:26.864
- I've never had a threesome.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.371
- Oh, don't worry.

19:28.406 --> 19:29.900
We'll take it slow.

19:33.873 --> 19:34.707
Come here.

21:55.619 --> 21:57.487
- What's going on?

21:57.522 --> 21:58.389
- I don't know.

22:03.528 --> 22:05.022
- Look who's just arrived.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.089
- Hey mate, you all right?

22:06.124 --> 22:07.090
- Hi.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.696
- How are we doing?

22:21.139 --> 22:23.073
- Hey, you okay?

22:23.108 --> 22:24.877
- Yeah, last night was fun.

22:25.946 --> 22:26.813
- Yeah. Yeah.

22:26.848 --> 22:29.717
It was. It was.

22:29.752 --> 22:31.180
- What do you make of Harry?

22:31.215 --> 22:34.590
- Yeah, he seems nice, but
haven't spoken to him much.

22:35.461 --> 22:37.153
- I think Naomi likes him.

22:37.188 --> 22:38.924
- Exotic place in
anyway.

22:39.894 --> 22:40.794
- A coupling

22:40.829 --> 22:42.191
will take place this afternoon.

22:43.535 --> 22:44.930
Harry will choose first,

22:44.965 --> 22:47.163
after spending time
with all the girls.

22:47.198 --> 22:51.541
Lucy and Harry, please go
into the garden for your date.

22:51.576 --> 22:53.004
- That was quick.

22:57.208 --> 23:00.946
- Would you reckon there
Lucy, fancy a bit of that?

23:00.981 --> 23:02.046
- Yeah, sure.

23:03.588 --> 23:05.654
- Makin', cool.

23:05.689 --> 23:06.721
Sorry about that.

23:08.252 --> 23:10.593
I don't think everyone
does wear them to be fair.

23:10.628 --> 23:11.957
- What's that?

23:11.992 --> 23:13.057
- Oh.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.058
- Ooh.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.829
- How about that?

23:15.864 --> 23:17.160
Where do you wanna sit, Lucy?

23:17.195 --> 23:18.194
Yeah?

23:19.164 --> 23:20.801
- You're very charming.

23:20.836 --> 23:22.066
- Maybe a bit old fashioned.

23:23.872 --> 23:25.069
- Yeah, I like it.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.170
- Aw, what a great
way to start the day.

23:27.205 --> 23:28.875
Well, great day at the office.

23:29.779 --> 23:30.943
Evil work, isn't it?

23:30.978 --> 23:32.142
- Yeah.

23:32.177 --> 23:33.715
- Thanks for booking
this.

23:33.750 --> 23:34.947
- You're welcome.

23:34.982 --> 23:37.851
So Harry, tell me
about yourself.

23:37.886 --> 23:39.248
- What do you wanna know?

23:39.283 --> 23:42.724
- Something, something you've
never told anyone else.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.127
- You and Harry
getting it rolling.

23:50.162 --> 23:50.996
- Yeah, why?

23:52.230 --> 23:53.229
Yes.

23:54.331 --> 23:55.264
- Maybe.

23:56.971 --> 23:59.510
- Naomi, please go upstairs
to bedroom eight alone.

24:03.879 --> 24:06.209
- Well, certainly can't
go to Redding anymore,

24:06.244 --> 24:07.551
that's for sure.

24:07.586 --> 24:08.684
- You're pulling my leg.

24:08.719 --> 24:09.553
- Am I?

24:18.696 --> 24:19.926
- 3000
Pounds will be added

24:19.961 --> 24:21.158
to the prize fund

24:21.193 --> 24:23.259
if you touch yourself
in front of the mirror.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.686
- Do it faster.

24:50.596 --> 24:51.254
- Oh.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.190
- Okay, all right.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.763
Well what about you?

24:54.798 --> 24:56.567
Have you ever done anything
crazy along the way?

24:56.602 --> 24:57.766
- Mm.

24:57.801 --> 25:00.802
Probably, this show.

25:00.837 --> 25:01.737
- Fair.
- Yeah?

25:01.772 --> 25:02.969
- Yeah.

25:03.004 --> 25:06.775
- It's only been 24
hours and it's crazy.

25:06.810 --> 25:08.007
- Really?
- It's wild, yeah.

25:08.042 --> 25:10.174
- It's not always
as calm as this?

25:10.209 --> 25:12.209
Is that bringing that wildness?

25:12.244 --> 25:13.144
- You're in for a treat.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.684
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

25:23.926 --> 25:26.993
- Naomi is that, oh God, sorry.

25:28.293 --> 25:29.666
- 10,000
pounds will be added

25:29.701 --> 25:31.635
to the prize fund if
you help Naomi finish.

25:43.011 --> 25:44.648
Take off Jasmine's top.

26:55.754 --> 26:57.182
- Have you seen Jasmine?

26:57.217 --> 26:59.855
She's supposed to be going
on a date with Harry.

26:59.890 --> 27:00.724
- Nope.

27:02.354 --> 27:03.188
- Okay.

27:07.799 --> 27:11.031
- What was all of that about
last night, by the way?

27:12.397 --> 27:14.331
- What?

27:14.366 --> 27:16.806
- When we were playing
spin the bottle.

27:16.841 --> 27:18.236
Why didn't you kiss me?

27:19.778 --> 27:23.010
- Well, I told you,
you're not my type.

27:25.751 --> 27:28.147
- I think we've gotten
enough on the wrong foot.

27:29.150 --> 27:29.984
- No.

27:31.185 --> 27:34.153
- You clearly have
a problem with me.

27:34.188 --> 27:37.156
- As hard as it may
be for you to believe,

27:37.191 --> 27:39.994
not everything revolves
around you, all right?

27:41.558 --> 27:44.163
Look, I don't have
a problem with you,

27:44.198 --> 27:46.396
just every thing you
fucking stand for.

28:28.308 --> 28:29.142
- Please
go into the kitchen

28:29.177 --> 28:30.473
for the next coupling.

28:46.359 --> 28:47.160
- Yeah.

28:47.195 --> 28:48.458
Have again.

28:49.868 --> 28:51.461
Time for the coupling.

28:51.496 --> 28:55.498
Harry, will you couple
or stay a singleton?

28:55.533 --> 28:56.367
- Ooh.

28:58.206 --> 29:00.470
I would like to couple please

29:02.243 --> 29:04.441
with Jasmine, if you fancy?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.817
- I agree to couple with Harry.

29:08.282 --> 29:09.820
- Callum,
what is your decision?

29:09.855 --> 29:12.988
- I'd like to couple with Lucy.

29:13.023 --> 29:13.857
- Huh?

29:17.324 --> 29:20.292
- I agree to couple with Callum.

29:21.526 --> 29:23.097
Naomi, will you couple

29:23.132 --> 29:25.396
or stay at singleton?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.035
- Singleton.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.467
- James,
what is your decision?

29:30.502 --> 29:31.534
- Flooded with choice,

29:31.569 --> 29:34.372
but guess I'll stay
a singleton, then.

29:35.375 --> 29:36.539
- The
coupling is complete.

29:39.115 --> 29:39.949
- Oh my God.

29:40.644 --> 29:45.086
A new person.

29:49.521 --> 29:50.487
A box.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.027
- Well yeah, thanks.

29:54.658 --> 29:58.429
- All right, tonight, there
will be a dress up party.

29:58.464 --> 30:02.367
Please make sure you wear
the costume assigned to you.

30:02.402 --> 30:03.236
- Amazing.

30:04.536 --> 30:05.469
- Oh wow.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.141
- You got to be kidding me.

30:12.016 --> 30:12.916
Beautiful.

30:12.951 --> 30:14.247
Jesus, this is a shit show.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.580
- Oh yes.

30:17.615 --> 30:18.955
Come on, naughty boy.

30:29.462 --> 30:32.496
- Cheers to the sexiest
ladies I've ever met.

30:32.531 --> 30:33.937
And to James.

30:33.972 --> 30:36.269
See you swaggerin'
and all in that mate.

30:36.304 --> 30:37.105
- Fuck you.

31:04.332 --> 31:07.366
- Feels like you've got
a bit of a temperature.

31:07.401 --> 31:08.235
- What?

31:09.238 --> 31:12.470
- I'm gonna have to give
you a full examination.

31:12.505 --> 31:13.306
- Oh,

31:15.079 --> 31:15.913
cracking.

31:46.671 --> 31:50.541
- Touch him.

31:50.576 --> 31:55.546
- What an interesting scar.

32:00.421 --> 32:02.586
- Touch her.

32:12.235 --> 32:14.235
- Does that feel better?

32:17.636 --> 32:18.734
- 3000
pounds added to the prize fund

32:18.769 --> 32:20.604
if you touch yourself.

32:26.150 --> 32:27.545
- What about now?

32:27.580 --> 32:28.414
- Yeah.

33:57.802 --> 33:59.604
- Hey, how are you doing?

33:59.639 --> 34:02.640
- Oh, you know, just
making some cash.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.685
- Looks like they've been
making some cash too.

34:16.689 --> 34:17.721
- Oh yeah.

34:19.164 --> 34:20.691
Play truth or dare.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.760
500 pounds will be
added to the prize fund

34:23.795 --> 34:28.171
for every honest answer
or completed dare.

34:28.206 --> 34:31.240
- Well, that's settled then.

34:31.275 --> 34:33.704
Naomi, truth or dare?

34:33.739 --> 34:34.540
- Dare.

34:35.776 --> 34:37.873
- - Nibble
Callum's earlobe for 15 seconds.

34:37.908 --> 34:41.745
- Wait, the viewers
are playing, too?

34:41.780 --> 34:46.783
- I don't mind.

34:56.201 --> 34:56.859
Lucy,

34:57.763 --> 34:58.762
truth or dare?

35:00.469 --> 35:01.270
- Truth.

35:02.207 --> 35:03.371
- Why are you you here?

35:06.277 --> 35:07.771
- Because I was invited to be.

35:08.576 --> 35:09.740
- But why?

35:09.775 --> 35:11.841
To find love or, or what?

35:13.647 --> 35:15.746
- Yeah, to couple with someone.

35:15.781 --> 35:16.780
Yeah.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.618
- Not to win?

35:19.653 --> 35:22.456
Do you actually care who
you're coupled up with?

35:23.558 --> 35:25.591
- Isn't it
someone else's turn now?

35:25.626 --> 35:26.823
- No, no.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.396
I think just let Lucy
answer the question.

35:29.465 --> 35:31.267
- She answered, mate.

35:31.302 --> 35:33.401
- Do you really think
she cares about you?

35:33.436 --> 35:34.831
- How fucking dare you.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.438
- It's an easy enough
question to answer, Lucy.

35:37.473 --> 35:38.703
- You look healthy.

35:38.738 --> 35:40.639
- Naomi, just because
you're a slut.

35:40.674 --> 35:41.607
- So jealous!

35:46.416 --> 35:47.976
- Take it easy,
what are you doing?

35:48.011 --> 35:50.011
Come on, I think we've all just
had a bit too much to drink.

35:50.046 --> 35:52.651
Yeah, let's just, why don't
we just call it a night, eh?

35:52.686 --> 35:53.487
Hey whoa.

35:54.655 --> 35:55.489
- Fine with me.

35:58.824 --> 35:59.658
- Wow.

36:12.904 --> 36:13.903
- Morning.

36:15.907 --> 36:16.906
- Morning.

36:18.042 --> 36:22.219
- Look Lucy, I think, I think
I owe you an apology for,

36:23.453 --> 36:24.914
for how I acted like what.

36:27.853 --> 36:28.852
Just,

36:30.856 --> 36:32.823
what I said was
that out of order.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.331
I mean we're all in for
different reasons and.

36:39.337 --> 36:41.865
- You know, saying,
I owe you an apology

36:41.900 --> 36:46.639
isn't actually saying, sorry,
you know that don't you?

36:46.674 --> 36:49.070
- That's fair.

36:49.105 --> 36:51.776
No, I know I've been a dick.

36:51.811 --> 36:55.351
And for, for last
night and before,

36:55.386 --> 36:56.517
everything that I've said,

36:56.552 --> 36:59.487
the way that I've
acted, I am truly sorry.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.989
- You know, next time,

37:07.024 --> 37:08.397
try getting to know somebody

37:08.432 --> 37:12.830
before you accuse them
of being a shit person.

37:12.865 --> 37:13.864
I mean.

37:14.768 --> 37:16.966
- I know, I know, I will.

37:17.001 --> 37:18.869
I'm sorry I've been such a dick.

37:23.843 --> 37:24.677
- Good.

37:32.588 --> 37:33.422
So,

37:34.590 --> 37:36.953
do you want some breakfast?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.559
- Yeah, of course, come on.

37:38.594 --> 37:40.429
I'll help you make it.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.774
- Mayo and scrambled
egg together?

38:29.876 --> 38:31.172
That's horrible.

38:31.207 --> 38:32.910
- What's your problem with
Mayo and scrambled eggs?

38:32.945 --> 38:34.945
It's no different
from egg salad.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.716
- They're completely different.

38:37.851 --> 38:39.983
- Am I interrupting something?

38:40.018 --> 38:43.019
- Fucking hell, where's
Naomi when you need her?

38:43.054 --> 38:43.987
- What?

38:44.022 --> 38:45.857
- Don't worry, he's distracting.

38:45.892 --> 38:47.793
Hi, I'm Lucy.

38:47.828 --> 38:48.860
Nice to meet you.

38:48.895 --> 38:50.400
- Liam.

38:50.435 --> 38:52.160
- So you are beautiful.

38:53.196 --> 38:56.032
- Oh thank you.

38:57.101 --> 39:00.003
- Oh my
God, a new arrival!

39:00.038 --> 39:04.975
- There it is.

39:05.846 --> 39:06.944
- There's four of them, now.

39:06.979 --> 39:08.044
We haven't had
anymore girls arrive.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.981
- Oh, that's fine by me.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.917
Especially if they
all look like Liam.

39:15.757 --> 39:16.987
Time for a game.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.890
Play, guess who.

39:18.925 --> 39:21.992
Girls are blindfolded
and must guess the order

39:22.027 --> 39:24.060
of the boys kissing them.

39:24.095 --> 39:27.668
250 pounds for
each correct guess.

39:28.968 --> 39:32.541
- Now that's my kind
of game.

39:37.581 --> 39:39.548
- Jasmine,
you will now be kissed

39:39.583 --> 39:41.011
by the four boys.

40:21.020 --> 40:24.087
- Jasmine,
what are your predictions?

40:27.730 --> 40:30.258
- Callum, Liam,

40:30.293 --> 40:33.030
Harry, of course, and James.

40:34.033 --> 40:35.934
- You
have won 500 pounds.

40:35.969 --> 40:37.001
- Yay.

40:37.036 --> 40:38.035
- Smashed it.

41:09.068 --> 41:11.101
- Naomi,
what are your predictions?

41:13.941 --> 41:15.908
- Harry, then James,

41:18.275 --> 41:19.945
Liam, then Callum.

42:12.428 --> 42:13.295
- Mm,

42:15.739 --> 42:19.840
Callum, James,

42:19.875 --> 42:21.105
Harry, Liam.

42:22.075 --> 42:25.109
You have won 250 pounds.

42:25.144 --> 42:25.945
- What?

42:30.215 --> 42:31.115
There will now be

42:31.150 --> 42:32.380
a girl's choice coupling.

42:32.415 --> 42:36.725
Naomi, will you couple
or stay a singleton?

42:36.760 --> 42:40.388
- I'm gonna couple with Callum.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.327
- I agree to couple with Naomi.

42:46.770 --> 42:48.770
- Lucy,
what is your decision?

42:53.469 --> 42:55.403
- I would like to
couple with Liam.

42:55.438 --> 42:56.239
- Hmm?

42:57.209 --> 42:58.747
I agree to couple with Lucy.

43:02.379 --> 43:03.884
Jasmine, will you couple

43:03.919 --> 43:05.380
or stay a singleton?

43:05.415 --> 43:07.283
- I'd like to couple
up with Harry.

43:07.318 --> 43:08.658
- Nice.

43:08.693 --> 43:10.319
I would love to
couple with Jasmine.

43:12.862 --> 43:14.158
- James,
you are a singleton

43:14.193 --> 43:16.061
and safe from elimination.

43:16.096 --> 43:19.801
All players must now text
in the names of the couple

43:19.836 --> 43:21.935
they think should
leave the manor.

43:23.708 --> 43:24.740
- What?

43:24.775 --> 43:25.906
Literally right now?

43:47.028 --> 43:47.928
Jasmine and Harry,

43:47.963 --> 43:50.095
you have been eliminated.

43:50.130 --> 43:52.361
You must leave the
manor immediately.

43:54.167 --> 43:55.166
- No way, man.

44:00.437 --> 44:01.469
- See you guys.

44:01.504 --> 44:02.877
- Good luck everyone.

44:02.912 --> 44:04.043
- Take it easy.

44:07.818 --> 44:11.149
- Well, at least they
got to leave together.

44:11.184 --> 44:13.151
- At least I'm only
the fifth wheel now.

44:17.960 --> 44:19.223
- Good luck.

44:19.258 --> 44:20.257
- Be good.

44:27.101 --> 44:29.299
- It feels weird that
they've left, doesn't it?

44:29.334 --> 44:32.973
- Yeah well, guess
it's a game isn't it?

44:33.008 --> 44:34.810
- Yeah, but I mean
we're still here,

44:34.845 --> 44:36.075
and Liam's joined us now.

44:37.309 --> 44:41.146
I'm excited to get started,
and to get to know you.

44:44.151 --> 44:45.821
- What about you, James?

44:45.856 --> 44:48.351
Mister Always a Singleton.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.122
You think there'll be
another girl arriving soon?

44:50.157 --> 44:51.255
- I might fucking hope so.

44:51.290 --> 44:54.060
Haven't had much
luck so far, have I?

44:54.095 --> 44:56.128
- The man's been abusive.

44:56.163 --> 44:57.360
We still have fun.

44:58.264 --> 44:59.967
- Yeah, well.

45:00.002 --> 45:02.530
- Actually, does anyone know
how much we've won so far?

45:04.204 --> 45:08.206
- Current
prize fund is 285,750 pounds.

45:09.308 --> 45:11.275
- She sure answered
that question.

45:12.211 --> 45:14.146
James, Liam and Lucy,

45:14.181 --> 45:16.445
please go into the garden.

45:16.480 --> 45:21.153
Naomi, please go to your
bedroom with Callum.

45:21.188 --> 45:23.892
- Oh my God.

45:25.522 --> 45:29.458
When will you be coming
up there?

45:37.270 --> 45:39.468
Callum, hurry up.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.014
- The prize
fund will be increased to

45:47.049 --> 45:49.412
650,000 pounds

45:49.447 --> 45:50.281
if you-

45:51.284 --> 45:53.053
- Well, this is gonna be fun.

45:54.617 --> 45:57.057
- So where are you from, Liam?

45:58.423 --> 45:59.862
- Oxford.

45:59.897 --> 46:01.457
Italian on my mom's side.

46:01.492 --> 46:03.558
- Oh, that's interesting.

46:04.429 --> 46:05.296
- Hello, big boy.

46:27.386 --> 46:29.452
- 10,000
pounds added to the prize fund

46:29.487 --> 46:31.454
if you have sex on this bed.

46:33.359 --> 46:34.226
- Surely.

46:34.261 --> 46:35.590
- We're gonna win.

46:37.066 --> 46:37.900
Come on.

46:39.398 --> 46:41.530
- So did you watch
the show before you came?

46:41.565 --> 46:44.104
- No, I mean, I tried to,

46:44.139 --> 46:45.908
but I couldn't find
the right link.

46:50.211 --> 46:51.045
- Oh.

46:53.247 --> 46:54.983
- So where are you from?

46:55.018 --> 46:56.182
- Surrey.

46:56.217 --> 46:57.117
Do you know it?

46:57.152 --> 46:58.415
- Yeah, about an hour away.

46:58.450 --> 46:59.449
- From where?

47:00.353 --> 47:01.616
- From Oxford.

47:01.651 --> 47:02.584
- Oh, okay.

47:09.032 --> 47:10.196
please don't stop.

47:10.231 --> 47:12.231
- Yeah, oh yes, don't
stop, don't stop!

47:18.239 --> 47:19.304
- Yeah, they thought

47:19.339 --> 47:21.273
I was crazy.

47:21.308 --> 47:22.174
- Naomi?

47:22.209 --> 47:23.440
- Naomi's having a
good time as always.

47:23.475 --> 47:26.080
- Must be a new arrival.

47:26.115 --> 47:27.609
- Naomi!

47:27.644 --> 47:29.017
- Something's not right.

47:34.453 --> 47:36.123
- Oh my God.

47:36.158 --> 47:39.720
Naomi, can you hear me, Naomi?

47:39.755 --> 47:41.491
No, no, no, no, no.

47:46.498 --> 47:48.168
No no no no no no.

47:49.567 --> 47:54.570
She's not breathing.

47:57.245 --> 47:58.673
She's not breathing.

47:58.708 --> 48:00.950
- The hell she's not.

48:00.985 --> 48:02.281
- What do we do?

48:03.152 --> 48:04.448
What do we do?

48:04.483 --> 48:06.516
- Call an ambulance Liam, quick.

48:06.551 --> 48:07.715
- I'm on it.

48:07.750 --> 48:09.156
- Naomi, can you hear me?

48:12.029 --> 48:12.687
Naomi?

48:15.494 --> 48:17.164
- There's something
wrong with these phones.

48:18.299 --> 48:20.398
They're blocking outbound calls.

48:20.433 --> 48:24.006
- We've gotta do something,
they must be fucking watching.

48:24.041 --> 48:25.205
What happened?

48:35.679 --> 48:37.514
- Help us please.

48:37.549 --> 48:38.548
She's dying.

48:39.782 --> 48:40.957
She's dying.

48:43.258 --> 48:44.521
Please, quickly, she's dying.

48:50.298 --> 48:52.298
- That's a lot of blood.

48:54.665 --> 48:55.499
This is bullshit.

49:00.044 --> 49:01.406
- They told me to do it.

49:15.554 --> 49:18.720
- Okay guys, so Callum's
journey ends here.

49:18.755 --> 49:23.461
He was involved in the
accident that led to Naomi's,

49:23.496 --> 49:26.035
well, you know, such tragedy.

49:28.732 --> 49:30.732
- I mean, what happens now?

49:30.767 --> 49:33.075
Is someone coming to pick us up?

49:33.110 --> 49:36.045
- No sweetie no, not
unless you want 'em to.

49:36.080 --> 49:38.047
The producers want you to stay.

49:38.082 --> 49:41.050
After all, we've yet to
find a winning couple,

49:41.811 --> 49:43.448
and for your trouble,

49:43.483 --> 49:47.617
we've agreed to increase the
cash prize to 650,000 pounds.

49:50.556 --> 49:51.588
How does that sound?

49:51.623 --> 49:52.754
Would you like to stay?

50:00.203 --> 50:01.367
Excellent, well,

50:01.402 --> 50:04.634
let's head back
inside and as always

50:04.669 --> 50:07.505
any information will come
through to your phones,

50:07.540 --> 50:08.506
and goodnight.

50:16.846 --> 50:17.680
- Well,

50:19.651 --> 50:20.650
goodnight guys.

50:22.621 --> 50:24.621
- Guess I should
call it a night, too.

50:25.921 --> 50:30.561
- Would you, could you
maybe stay with me tonight?

50:30.596 --> 50:32.728
I don't know if I can
be on my own after that.

50:33.929 --> 50:35.566
- Sure.

50:35.601 --> 50:36.435
- Okay.

50:52.585 --> 50:56.521
- You don't think
Callum meant it, do you?

50:56.556 --> 50:57.687
- Hmm?

50:57.722 --> 50:59.623
- You know, before, outside,

51:00.758 --> 51:03.792
he said something about
them making him do it.

51:05.862 --> 51:06.696
What?

51:07.699 --> 51:09.204
- I dunno.

51:09.239 --> 51:10.898
- It just feels weird.

51:12.176 --> 51:13.769
- He's probably in shock.

51:13.804 --> 51:15.507
Didn't know what he was sayin'.

51:16.444 --> 51:17.278
- Yeah.

51:18.611 --> 51:19.577
Maybe.

51:21.383 --> 51:23.581
- Do you want to talk about it?

51:23.616 --> 51:26.716
- You're right, I
mean, it's the shock.

51:31.954 --> 51:33.657
You should probably
get some sleep.

51:34.924 --> 51:37.199
Well, I should
probably get a shower.

55:51.015 --> 55:52.520
- Oh shit, Liam.

55:53.754 --> 55:55.754
What are you staring at?

55:57.153 --> 55:58.427
- Just looking at you.

56:02.961 --> 56:04.466
- What time is it?

56:05.799 --> 56:06.963
- Almost noon.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.473
Why don't you put
on some clothes,

56:11.508 --> 56:12.837
and I'll make us breakfast.

56:14.071 --> 56:14.905
- Oh,

56:16.480 --> 56:17.138
okay.

56:25.852 --> 56:26.686
Morning.

56:27.821 --> 56:28.655
- Morning.

56:30.890 --> 56:31.889
You sleep all right?

56:33.794 --> 56:35.860
- Yeah, all things considered.

56:37.699 --> 56:38.764
What's for breakfast?

56:39.932 --> 56:41.162
- Green smoothie.

56:42.935 --> 56:44.869
- Oh, thanks.

56:51.581 --> 56:52.943
- Hello, darling.

56:52.978 --> 56:56.650
- Georgia, what
are you doing here?

56:56.685 --> 56:58.113
- I'm the new arrival, aren't I?

57:00.557 --> 57:03.954
- Sorry, do you two
know each other?

57:03.989 --> 57:04.988
- We're acquainted.

57:07.256 --> 57:08.563
Hi, I'm Georgia,

57:10.534 --> 57:11.632
Jamie's ex-girlfriend.

57:15.033 --> 57:16.538
- Sorry, what is this?

57:16.573 --> 57:19.002
- I can, I can
explain everything.

57:19.037 --> 57:22.005
You know, it's just, we-

57:23.173 --> 57:24.975
- Jamie broke up
with me last week,

57:27.078 --> 57:29.947
and then a few days ago I
found out he's on this show,

57:30.884 --> 57:31.718
getting fucked.

57:33.051 --> 57:35.084
- Look, I just,

57:35.988 --> 57:37.922
I can explain everything.

57:37.957 --> 57:39.253
I, I.

57:39.288 --> 57:40.958
- Don't worry Jamie.

57:40.993 --> 57:41.992
I forgive you.

57:42.995 --> 57:44.830
- You, you do?

57:44.865 --> 57:46.260
- Yeah, of course I do.

57:46.295 --> 57:48.999
And I can completely
understand why you did it too.

57:51.872 --> 57:52.673
- Really?

57:52.708 --> 57:53.707
- Yeah, absolutely.

57:53.742 --> 57:55.236
The producers called and well,

57:55.271 --> 57:57.106
they offered me a role
in the show and they said

57:57.141 --> 57:59.174
we don't actually
have to be broken up.

58:01.046 --> 58:02.551
We can be in this together.

58:03.378 --> 58:04.982
So what'd you say?

58:06.084 --> 58:08.986
You wanna get back
together and couple up?

58:09.021 --> 58:11.659
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

58:11.694 --> 58:12.528
Yeah.

58:13.223 --> 58:14.024
- Mm.

58:18.866 --> 58:21.328
- James
and Georgia are now coupled.

58:21.363 --> 58:24.573
- Mm, isn't this exciting?

58:26.005 --> 58:27.004
- Yeah.

58:27.908 --> 58:29.006
So exciting.

58:32.715 --> 58:33.747
- I think it's great.

58:34.409 --> 58:35.617
I'm Liam, by the way.

58:37.181 --> 58:39.588
So when did you arrive?

58:39.623 --> 58:40.919
- Literally, just now.

58:42.219 --> 58:44.054
- So you've not seen
the rest of the estate yet.

58:46.663 --> 58:48.190
We'll give you the tour.

58:48.225 --> 58:49.928
- That'll be amazing.

58:49.963 --> 58:52.095
I just need to drop
my bags off upstairs.

58:52.130 --> 58:54.031
- I'll help you.

58:57.707 --> 58:59.971
Lucy, you coming?

59:00.006 --> 59:01.236
- Yeah, of course.

59:01.271 --> 59:03.271
I just need to
finish my breakfast.

59:06.078 --> 59:06.912
- Jamie?

59:08.014 --> 59:09.013
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

59:09.048 --> 59:10.784
I'll just, I'll
just clean these up.

59:10.819 --> 59:11.653
All right?

59:15.318 --> 59:16.988
- You have some fucking nerve.

59:18.057 --> 59:19.386
- Don't start.

59:19.421 --> 59:20.728
- Don't start?

59:20.763 --> 59:21.960
How dare you.

59:21.995 --> 59:23.797
You judged me on the
spot the day I arrived,

59:23.832 --> 59:26.393
saying something like,
everything I stand for

59:26.428 --> 59:29.264
when you've just done that?

59:29.299 --> 59:31.035
- Look, you know nothing
about this situation.

59:31.070 --> 59:32.135
You know nothing about me.

59:32.170 --> 59:33.301
So.

59:33.336 --> 59:34.434
- You are a selfish
fucking prick.

59:34.469 --> 59:36.106
- Oh I'm, I'm selfish?

59:36.141 --> 59:37.305
- Yes.

59:37.340 --> 59:39.076
- Says the one who
coupled up with Callum

59:39.111 --> 59:41.012
to get close to the prize.

59:41.047 --> 59:43.080
- Oh my God, we're
all here to win.

59:43.115 --> 59:45.049
At least I'm not a hypocrite.

59:45.084 --> 59:47.755
- Oh, I'm a
hypocrite as well now, okay.

59:47.790 --> 59:48.954
- Yes.

59:48.989 --> 59:50.021
I mean, do you even
wanna get back with her?

59:50.056 --> 59:51.451
- Yes, obviously.

59:51.486 --> 59:53.090
- Seriously?

59:53.125 --> 59:54.729
Okay, or are you just
doing it because you know

59:54.764 --> 59:57.061
you're gonna end up
a singleton again.

59:57.096 --> 1:00:00.394
- Oh God, like I say, you know,
absolutely nothing about me.

1:00:00.429 --> 1:00:02.869
- What, are you scared
she's just gonna find out

1:00:02.904 --> 1:00:05.707
you're in it for the
cash? Or I don't know.

1:00:05.742 --> 1:00:06.939
I don't know, James.

1:00:06.974 --> 1:00:08.072
- I'm warning you.

1:00:08.107 --> 1:00:09.172
- What?

1:00:09.207 --> 1:00:12.439
- If you say
anything to Georgia.

1:00:12.474 --> 1:00:14.144
- What are you gonna do
when all this is over?

1:00:14.179 --> 1:00:17.785
Are you just gonna, are you
gonna finish with her again and.

1:00:17.820 --> 1:00:19.787
- Just, you know, nothing
about the situation?

1:00:19.822 --> 1:00:21.822
Just, just, shut up.

1:00:21.857 --> 1:00:23.054
- What?

1:00:23.089 --> 1:00:25.694
We aren't so high and
mighty now, are we, eh?

1:00:25.729 --> 1:00:26.354
- Why?

1:00:26.389 --> 1:00:27.861
- What James? What?

1:01:40.067 --> 1:01:41.231
- Are you

1:01:41.266 --> 1:01:42.804
going to let her
get away with that?

1:01:47.140 --> 1:01:49.140
25,000 pounds will be
added to the prize fund,

1:01:49.175 --> 1:01:52.539
if you get revenge,
instructions will follow.

1:02:14.332 --> 1:02:15.232
- Jamie?

1:02:16.268 --> 1:02:17.267
Where are you?

1:02:24.881 --> 1:02:25.539
- Coming.

1:02:42.261 --> 1:02:44.195
- Yeah, some of these.

1:02:54.042 --> 1:02:54.975
- I think this
hedge works its way

1:02:55.010 --> 1:02:56.009
all the way around the estate.

1:02:57.111 --> 1:02:58.077
Seems pretty secure.

1:02:59.278 --> 1:03:00.079
You think it is?

1:03:01.016 --> 1:03:02.312
- Oh yeah.

1:03:02.347 --> 1:03:03.214
I think so.

1:03:05.251 --> 1:03:06.083
- What a cute sound.

1:03:08.122 --> 1:03:09.990
It's a nice day, we
should do something.

1:03:11.158 --> 1:03:12.586
- There's a pool
on the other side.

1:03:12.621 --> 1:03:14.258
- A pool?

1:03:14.293 --> 1:03:16.029
- Why didn't you
say so? Let's go.

1:03:22.565 --> 1:03:23.399
- Coming, Luce?

1:03:26.404 --> 1:03:28.239
- Yeah, yeah.

1:03:28.274 --> 1:03:31.473
I just need to check
something really quickly.

1:03:31.508 --> 1:03:32.881
I'll be there in a minute.

1:04:15.288 --> 1:04:16.386
- I'm assuming.

1:04:26.431 --> 1:04:28.464
- I reckon we could do
find some purpose here.

1:04:28.499 --> 1:04:29.597
- Mm, really?

1:04:30.699 --> 1:04:32.468
Me and Jamie against
you and Luce.

1:04:35.275 --> 1:04:37.440
- Maybe, I mean,
everyone's been eliminated.

1:04:37.475 --> 1:04:40.443
It's only me and Lucy left
from the original five.

1:04:40.478 --> 1:04:43.083
- Mm, getting the original five.

1:04:44.647 --> 1:04:46.284
- Some how it's sane.

1:04:47.188 --> 1:04:48.352
- Who knows?

1:04:48.387 --> 1:04:49.617
A whole new group
could arrive tomorrow.

1:04:49.652 --> 1:04:51.289
- Or tonight.

1:04:51.324 --> 1:04:52.422
- Yeah.

1:04:52.457 --> 1:04:53.753
For tonight.

1:04:53.788 --> 1:04:55.062
- Anything can happen.

1:04:56.296 --> 1:04:58.098
- Time
for a treasure hunt.

1:04:58.133 --> 1:05:00.969
Work as a couple to find
the manor's secret room,

1:05:01.004 --> 1:05:03.235
and enjoy the delights within.

1:05:03.270 --> 1:05:06.370
You have 30 seconds
to discuss strategies.

1:05:10.178 --> 1:05:11.375
- I know exactly what to do.

1:05:11.410 --> 1:05:14.081
- Good, because I
do not have a plan.

1:05:14.116 --> 1:05:15.742
- We need to split up.

1:05:15.777 --> 1:05:17.414
- Huh?

1:05:17.449 --> 1:05:18.415
The instructions says that
we've gotta work as a couple

1:05:18.450 --> 1:05:19.284
to find the room.

1:05:20.485 --> 1:05:22.056
- We will be.

1:05:22.091 --> 1:05:23.783
We'll cover more
ground that way, right?

1:05:23.818 --> 1:05:25.323
- Yeah.

1:05:25.358 --> 1:05:26.357
I guess.

1:05:26.392 --> 1:05:28.194
- Just trust me.

1:05:28.229 --> 1:05:29.162
- Okay, well, what if
one of us finds the room?

1:05:29.197 --> 1:05:31.263
Do we need a meeting point or?

1:05:34.169 --> 1:05:36.631
- One that finds it gives a
shout to the other from there.

1:05:36.666 --> 1:05:41.042
- Okay, I've got .

1:05:42.309 --> 1:05:43.704
- The
treasure hunt has begun.

1:06:02.857 --> 1:06:04.032
- This way.

1:06:04.067 --> 1:06:05.495
- How do you know ways?

1:06:07.136 --> 1:06:08.300
Well, doesn't really feel like

1:06:08.335 --> 1:06:09.499
much of a treasure
hunt, does it?

1:06:09.534 --> 1:06:11.204
- Are you complaining?

1:06:11.239 --> 1:06:12.403
- No, I'm set.

1:06:12.438 --> 1:06:13.337
- Go, because we can
always let Liam and Lucy

1:06:13.373 --> 1:06:16.407
enjoy the delights, but
then instead of you.

1:06:16.442 --> 1:06:17.441
- No, sorry.

1:06:18.873 --> 1:06:20.147
I think it's better to find
it so quickly, that's all.

1:06:20.182 --> 1:06:21.181
- Wow.

1:06:21.216 --> 1:06:23.183
I have a surprise for you.

1:06:23.218 --> 1:06:24.811
You're gonna love it.

1:06:33.525 --> 1:06:35.195
What do you think?

1:06:41.236 --> 1:06:42.433
- 10,000
pounds will be added

1:06:42.468 --> 1:06:44.138
to the prize fund
if you use the room.

1:06:45.834 --> 1:06:48.406
- I think that can be
arranged, don't you Jamie?

1:06:49.343 --> 1:06:50.210
- Yes.

1:06:51.477 --> 1:06:52.410
Georgia is the dom.

1:06:52.445 --> 1:06:54.445
- Get down on your knees.

1:06:57.648 --> 1:06:58.548
- Punish James.

1:07:02.125 --> 1:07:02.783
- I will.

1:07:20.605 --> 1:07:22.374
Who's been a bad boy?

1:07:23.806 --> 1:07:24.640
- I have.

1:07:27.315 --> 1:07:29.513
- Who needs to be punished?

1:07:29.548 --> 1:07:31.449
- I do.
- Louder.

1:07:31.484 --> 1:07:32.780
- I do, Mistress.

1:07:45.498 --> 1:07:46.497
- Yes.

1:07:47.368 --> 1:07:48.202
You do.

1:07:54.441 --> 1:07:56.837
Take off your clothes,
get on the bed.

1:07:58.214 --> 1:07:59.543
- Yes, Mistress.

1:08:44.656 --> 1:08:46.392
- Liam?

1:08:46.427 --> 1:08:47.327
- Yeah?

1:08:47.362 --> 1:08:48.592
- Have you found anything yet?

1:08:49.595 --> 1:08:50.660
- No.

1:08:50.695 --> 1:08:51.694
- Oh.

1:09:02.443 --> 1:09:04.443
- Can you free yourself?

1:09:21.759 --> 1:09:22.593
Now wait.

1:09:53.725 --> 1:09:54.592
- Go slower.

1:10:43.104 --> 1:10:48.008
- Liam, where have you
found ?

1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:12.835
- You deserve this.

1:11:17.743 --> 1:11:19.809
- What's happening?

1:11:25.454 --> 1:11:26.849
- Do you like this?

1:11:28.886 --> 1:11:30.820
- Yes.

1:11:44.099 --> 1:11:46.440
- Do you think I
should keep going?

1:11:47.168 --> 1:11:49.036
- Yes.

1:11:51.678 --> 1:11:53.480
- I've got a wild one.

1:11:56.452 --> 1:11:57.649
- Kill Naomi.

1:12:14.635 --> 1:12:15.700
- The
prize fund will be increased

1:12:15.735 --> 1:12:20.166
to 650,000 pounds,
if you kill Naomi.

1:12:31.245 --> 1:12:32.750
- Georgia.

1:12:38.659 --> 1:12:42.793
- James, James.

1:12:42.828 --> 1:12:43.827
James.

1:12:48.163 --> 1:12:49.063
You can't save him.

1:12:49.098 --> 1:12:50.636
Finish the treasure hunt.

1:12:57.843 --> 1:12:59.612
- Fuck you.

1:12:59.647 --> 1:13:03.143
Fuck you, fuck you
and your fucking game.

1:13:14.497 --> 1:13:16.497
- Get off him you bitch.

1:13:19.898 --> 1:13:20.798
Come here bitch.

1:13:46.661 --> 1:13:47.891
James?

1:13:47.926 --> 1:13:49.728
James, are you okay?

1:13:49.763 --> 1:13:51.664
- She tried to kill me.

1:13:53.162 --> 1:13:54.832
- I know, I know.

1:13:56.132 --> 1:13:57.296
- I can't believe
it, she tried to kill me.

1:13:57.331 --> 1:13:57.967
- I know they sent
me a recording of it.

1:13:58.002 --> 1:14:00.134
- What the fuck?

1:14:00.169 --> 1:14:01.542
- I know, I'm just,

1:14:01.577 --> 1:14:03.170
I'm glad I got here
before, I don't know.

1:14:04.976 --> 1:14:06.008
I thought you were dead.

1:14:14.590 --> 1:14:15.215
Okay.

1:14:15.250 --> 1:14:16.117
Right.

1:14:17.186 --> 1:14:18.020
Okay.

1:14:19.595 --> 1:14:22.629
Put on some pants and then
we'll talk to your girlfriend.

1:14:23.731 --> 1:14:24.829
- Ex-girlfriend.

1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:30.032
- So what the fuck
was that about?

1:14:31.706 --> 1:14:34.300
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:14:34.335 --> 1:14:37.006
- Georgia, you just
tried to kill me.

1:14:37.041 --> 1:14:40.581
- You dumped me via text,

1:14:40.616 --> 1:14:43.584
to come on a
fucking dating show.

1:14:43.619 --> 1:14:45.916
- You said you understood.

1:14:45.951 --> 1:14:47.148
- No, it doesn't mean,

1:14:47.183 --> 1:14:48.281
I thought it was a
good in .

1:14:50.956 --> 1:14:54.727
Oh poor little Jamie

1:14:54.762 --> 1:14:56.960
with all of his debts.

1:14:58.227 --> 1:15:01.129
Just get a payment plan like
any normal fucking person.

1:15:01.164 --> 1:15:02.328
- Oh, fuck you.

1:15:02.363 --> 1:15:03.769
- All right.

1:15:03.804 --> 1:15:06.365
Look, while I agree
it was a dick move,

1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:09.104
but I don't think it's
reason to murder someone.

1:15:09.139 --> 1:15:10.974
- Just one of the reasons.

1:15:11.009 --> 1:15:13.581
- One of the reasons, what
other reasons are there?

1:15:13.616 --> 1:15:14.714
- They told me to.

1:15:15.948 --> 1:15:16.947
- Who?

1:15:17.917 --> 1:15:19.015
- They did.

1:15:19.050 --> 1:15:19.884
- Why?

1:15:21.624 --> 1:15:25.725
- They called me, and said the
viewers needed more twists,

1:15:27.124 --> 1:15:29.894
and I could get my revenge
with no consequences.

1:15:30.831 --> 1:15:31.896
- You're lying.

1:15:31.931 --> 1:15:33.029
- And why would I lie?

1:15:33.064 --> 1:15:34.294
- Because you have to be.

1:15:35.902 --> 1:15:39.035
- So what happened to Naomi
was just an accident, was it?

1:15:39.070 --> 1:15:42.302
- Well, yeah, of course
it was, she fell.

1:15:42.337 --> 1:15:44.205
- No, No.

1:15:45.208 --> 1:15:46.273
Callum pushed her.

1:15:47.375 --> 1:15:49.210
- What the fuck?

1:15:49.245 --> 1:15:51.982
- While I was searching in
the treasure hunt earlier,

1:15:52.017 --> 1:15:55.051
I found Callum's phone and
there was a message on there.

1:15:55.086 --> 1:15:57.691
They, they said something
to him asking him do.

1:16:01.059 --> 1:16:01.959
- And how exactly did you know

1:16:01.994 --> 1:16:03.994
to come looking for Miss Lucy?

1:16:06.031 --> 1:16:06.898
- This should be recording.

1:16:06.933 --> 1:16:07.932
- Exactly.

1:16:09.001 --> 1:16:10.231
They're watching everything.

1:16:11.674 --> 1:16:12.937
They love it when we fuck.

1:16:15.370 --> 1:16:17.007
And they love it when we fight.

1:16:21.981 --> 1:16:23.310
Which reminds me Lucy.

1:16:27.756 --> 1:16:28.381
Where's Liam?

1:16:33.256 --> 1:16:34.992
- Liam
is waiting for you.

1:16:40.934 --> 1:16:41.768
- Liam?

1:16:44.432 --> 1:16:45.266
Oh my God.

1:16:46.170 --> 1:16:48.005
- What the fuck, now?

1:16:49.041 --> 1:16:50.678
Quick, we just find him before.

1:16:53.276 --> 1:16:54.110
- Come on.

1:16:56.345 --> 1:16:57.179
Liam?

1:17:06.058 --> 1:17:07.057
- Lucy?

1:17:15.771 --> 1:17:19.069
- What do we do?

1:17:19.104 --> 1:17:19.905
- Help me find him.

1:17:21.139 --> 1:17:22.237
Time for another game.

1:17:22.272 --> 1:17:24.107
Play murder in the dark.

1:17:25.946 --> 1:17:29.310
- James, James, I'm
scared, I'm scared.

1:17:29.345 --> 1:17:31.048
- It's fine, it's
fine, it's fine.

1:17:31.083 --> 1:17:34.183
Listen, now then, there's
a torch in your phone.

1:17:34.218 --> 1:17:35.052
Okay, it's gonna be all right.

1:17:35.087 --> 1:17:36.086
Come on.

1:17:38.090 --> 1:17:38.924
Come on.

1:17:42.391 --> 1:17:43.390
Let's do it.

1:18:02.576 --> 1:18:04.510
- What if he's outside?

1:18:17.129 --> 1:18:18.832
- Where is it?

1:18:18.867 --> 1:18:20.262
- The hedges, they go
all the way around.

1:18:20.297 --> 1:18:21.934
How are we supposed to get out?

1:18:21.969 --> 1:18:24.167
- Well through the
front gate, surely.

1:18:24.202 --> 1:18:25.300
- It'll be locked.

1:18:25.335 --> 1:18:26.873
It'll be locked by now.

1:18:26.908 --> 1:18:28.171
- Just.

1:18:28.206 --> 1:18:29.909
I dunno, through the forest?

1:18:29.944 --> 1:18:31.504
- Yeah, okay.

1:18:31.539 --> 1:18:33.814
James, James, no.

1:18:35.147 --> 1:18:36.179
- Lucy, run.

1:18:36.214 --> 1:18:37.213
- James, no!

1:19:40.212 --> 1:19:41.541
- Where are you?

1:19:46.482 --> 1:19:49.252
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:58.063
You actually thought
I wouldn't find out

1:19:58.098 --> 1:19:59.163
about you and James?

1:20:01.233 --> 1:20:02.067
Yeah.

1:20:03.301 --> 1:20:05.268
I saw you in the kitchen.

1:20:11.078 --> 1:20:13.144
- Just don't
understand it though.

1:20:13.179 --> 1:20:15.014
We were gettin'
on so well, Luce.

1:20:16.314 --> 1:20:17.313
Never mind.

1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:28.060
Never mind.

1:20:29.294 --> 1:20:32.196
You made your choice and now

1:20:34.332 --> 1:20:35.265
you can pay for it.

1:20:41.669 --> 1:20:44.175
- Please Liam, please please.

1:20:44.210 --> 1:20:45.572
It's just a game,
it's just a game.

1:20:45.607 --> 1:20:47.145
Please let me go, please.

1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:48.641
- A game journey?

1:20:48.676 --> 1:20:50.280
- What else could it be?

1:20:50.315 --> 1:20:52.447
I wasn't meaning it like that.

1:20:52.482 --> 1:20:55.351
- You go around
fucking everyone?

1:20:56.651 --> 1:20:57.584
Humiliate me in front of
all these fucking cameras.

1:20:57.619 --> 1:20:59.520
- It wasn't like that, I swear.

1:20:59.555 --> 1:21:01.060
Please Liam, I'm sorry.

1:21:01.095 --> 1:21:01.929
I'm sorry.

1:21:01.964 --> 1:21:03.095
I'm sorry.

1:21:03.130 --> 1:21:04.327
- Sorry. Sorry.

1:21:04.362 --> 1:21:05.361
Shut up.

1:21:36.625 --> 1:21:39.065
- I fucking hate smoothies.

1:21:40.794 --> 1:21:42.068
Are you okay?

1:21:42.103 --> 1:21:42.937
- Yeah.

1:21:44.237 --> 1:21:45.038
- Can you stand?

1:21:45.073 --> 1:21:46.105
- Yeah.

1:21:46.140 --> 1:21:47.007
I think so.

1:21:51.079 --> 1:21:53.409
- Let's get the fuck
out for real this time.

1:21:58.515 --> 1:22:00.218
- James, James.

1:22:00.253 --> 1:22:01.318
We have to go.

1:22:04.059 --> 1:22:04.717
It's okay.

1:22:19.701 --> 1:22:20.601
- Wow.

1:22:20.636 --> 1:22:21.701
Well done, you two.

1:22:21.736 --> 1:22:23.373
What a show!

1:22:24.376 --> 1:22:25.507
- What?

1:22:25.542 --> 1:22:26.442
- Gosh, it was
getting really tense

1:22:26.477 --> 1:22:28.246
toward the end there, wasn't it?

1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:32.679
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet your winning couple.

1:22:34.056 --> 1:22:36.452
Congratulations, Lucy and James.

1:22:39.589 --> 1:22:41.292
- What are you talking about?

1:22:44.264 --> 1:22:47.364
- You have just won
the Game of Love.

1:22:49.236 --> 1:22:51.731
Woo!

1:23:04.515 --> 1:23:05.349
Woo!

1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:19.165
- We're here now.

1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:20.067
- Lucy, James.

1:23:20.102 --> 1:23:21.365
Hi.
- Hello.

1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:22.201
- Hi.

1:23:22.236 --> 1:23:23.136
- Sorry we're late.

1:23:23.171 --> 1:23:24.236
The traffic was horrible.

1:23:24.271 --> 1:23:25.402
- No problem.

1:23:25.437 --> 1:23:26.436
Although, you can't
really be late

1:23:26.471 --> 1:23:27.371
arriving at your
own house, can you?

1:23:27.406 --> 1:23:28.405
- Oh yeah.

1:23:28.440 --> 1:23:29.406
- Guess not.

1:23:29.441 --> 1:23:30.737
- True, anyway,

1:23:30.772 --> 1:23:33.707
here are the keys and the
final bits of paperwork.

1:23:33.742 --> 1:23:37.315
I guess all that's left to
say is, congratulations.

1:23:37.350 --> 1:23:39.251
- So what are we
unpacking first, love?

1:23:39.286 --> 1:23:41.187
- Well, the bedroom, obviously.

1:23:42.817 --> 1:23:44.289
- You make a sweet couple.

1:23:44.324 --> 1:23:45.224
I hope you'll be
very happy here.

1:23:45.259 --> 1:23:46.654
It's a very safe neighborhood.

1:23:47.822 --> 1:23:49.459
- Yeah, thanks.

1:23:49.494 --> 1:23:52.429
- Actually, if you don't
mind me asking, it's just,

1:23:52.464 --> 1:23:56.202
you're also the youngest cash
buyers our agency's ever had.

1:23:56.237 --> 1:23:57.533
And how did you
afford the profit?

1:23:57.568 --> 1:23:59.139
Do you both work in finance?

1:24:00.670 --> 1:24:03.803
- We kind of came into
some money last year.

1:24:03.838 --> 1:24:05.343
- Win the lottery, did you?

1:24:06.214 --> 1:24:07.246
- Something like that, yeah.

1:24:07.281 --> 1:24:08.742
- Oh, right.

1:24:08.777 --> 1:24:10.381
Anyway, I'd better be going.

1:24:10.416 --> 1:24:12.614
Any questions at all,
you know where we are?

1:24:13.716 --> 1:24:14.517
- Thanks.

1:24:15.685 --> 1:24:17.388
- Oh, let's get
these boxes in, eh?

1:24:17.423 --> 1:24:18.356
- Finally.
- Yeah.

1:24:18.391 --> 1:24:20.160
- Sweet home, baby.

1:24:20.195 --> 1:24:20.820
- Hi there.

1:24:20.855 --> 1:24:22.492
- Oh, hello mate.

1:24:23.429 --> 1:24:24.725
- Moving in, are you?

1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:25.660
- Yeah, yeah.

1:24:25.695 --> 1:24:27.596
We just bought at the house.

1:24:27.631 --> 1:24:29.466
- Congratulations.

1:24:29.501 --> 1:24:30.896
Welcome to the neighborhood.

1:24:30.931 --> 1:24:32.733
- Thanks, oh you, you
live around here, do you?

1:24:32.768 --> 1:24:34.867
- Oh yeah, sorry,
I should have said.

1:24:34.902 --> 1:24:36.341
I'm across the road there.

1:24:36.376 --> 1:24:37.540
- Oh.

1:24:37.575 --> 1:24:39.509
- It's lovely street.

1:24:39.544 --> 1:24:40.642
Fairly safe.

1:24:41.975 --> 1:24:43.546
- Oh wow.

1:24:43.581 --> 1:24:45.185
That's good.

1:24:45.220 --> 1:24:48.914
- I just wanted to say, I loved
you in the show last year.

1:24:51.787 --> 1:24:52.621
- Really?

1:24:54.196 --> 1:24:55.426
- Yeah, yeah.

1:24:55.461 --> 1:24:58.330
I was rooting for both
of you the whole time.

1:24:58.365 --> 1:25:01.564
- You watched the whole thing?

1:25:01.599 --> 1:25:03.599
- Absolutely. I was hooked.

1:25:03.634 --> 1:25:05.271
I even sent some request in.

1:25:05.306 --> 1:25:09.407
Couldn't believe it when I
heard the messages read out.

1:25:09.442 --> 1:25:10.606
I felt famous.

1:25:13.006 --> 1:25:15.512
Anyway, hope you settle in.

1:25:15.547 --> 1:25:17.382
Well, have a good day.

1:25:37.404 --> 1:25:38.238
- Oh fuck.
