WEBVTT

02:22.910 --> 02:24.846
The key's under the rock.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.585
How are you doing?

03:05.419 --> 03:06.087
Fine.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.724
I'm gonna call my agent and let
him know I'm here.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.457
Okay.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.525
I'm at my family's house
upstate.

03:44.559 --> 03:45.358
- And how's that?

03:45.392 --> 03:46.493
It's musty and dusty.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.663
It's completely off the map.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.566
- Dennis, the studio is very
angry with you.
-Okay.

03:51.966 --> 03:53.467
What are they saying, how bad is
it?

03:54.135 --> 03:54.969
- It's bad.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.607
And the other movie?

03:59.640 --> 04:00.541
- It's gone.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.005
Hey, buddy.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.484
You really can't hear a damn
thing out here.

06:04.966 --> 06:05.700
Hello?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.652
You know, I don't have to drink
if you don't want me to.

06:25.253 --> 06:25.987
No.

06:26.821 --> 06:27.688
I'm fine.

06:28.022 --> 06:29.857
You enjoy. Please.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.996
Thanks for sticking it out with
me.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.464
I love you.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.834
To the moon.

07:44.699 --> 07:45.733
Can't sleep?

07:46.600 --> 07:47.868
Another nightmare?

07:48.602 --> 07:49.236
Yeah.

07:49.904 --> 07:50.905
It's my own fault.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.641
Is it strange being back here?

07:58.546 --> 07:59.714
All my life ...

08:02.016 --> 08:03.985
I feel like I've been forcing
myself

08:04.018 --> 08:05.453
to be someone I wasn't.

08:09.357 --> 08:11.258
You were the first person who
made me

08:11.292 --> 08:12.760
not hate who I was.

08:15.129 --> 08:16.897
I didn't have to pretend
anymore.

08:27.141 --> 08:29.143
How did we get here?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.081
Come here.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.585
I'm not leaving you.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.155
I would kill for you. You know
that, right?

08:51.632 --> 08:53.134
I wanna try again.

08:54.135 --> 08:56.404
Mia ... are you sure?

08:57.138 --> 08:58.606
The doctor said we can start

08:58.639 --> 09:00.841
in three months, and it's been
four.

09:44.452 --> 09:45.820
What the ...

09:45.853 --> 09:46.587
Is that your ...

09:46.620 --> 09:47.321
- Brother?
- Brother.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.723
I thought he was somewhere out
west.

09:49.757 --> 09:50.691
So did I.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.064
Should I be nervous?

09:57.631 --> 09:58.632
I hope not.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.168
Well, he must have gotten in
when we were asleep,

10:01.202 --> 10:02.369
did you hear anything?

10:02.837 --> 10:03.804
Not a thing.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.524
What are you doing here?

10:56.023 --> 10:57.057
Wow.

10:58.692 --> 10:59.860
It's nice to see you, too.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.532
Wasn't expecting anyone.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.134
Surprise.

11:08.570 --> 11:10.804
- He was scratching at the door,
I didn't want to wake you.

11:15.276 --> 11:16.578
You look like hell, brother.

11:17.546 --> 11:18.547
Trust me, I've been there.

11:19.980 --> 11:20.681
Yeah, well ...

11:20.714 --> 11:21.415
Hi!

11:21.782 --> 11:22.483
This is my wife.

11:22.716 --> 11:23.585
Mia!

11:23.618 --> 11:24.718
Pleasure to meet you.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.655
Heard about the wedding. It
sounded ...

11:27.454 --> 11:28.255
really nice.

11:28.489 --> 11:30.457
We wanted you to be there, but
we didn't have

11:30.491 --> 11:32.193
a number or an address.

11:32.226 --> 11:33.595
You fell off the side of the
earth.

11:34.295 --> 11:35.564
It's probably for the best.

11:35.829 --> 11:36.997
I wasn't, uh ...

11:37.364 --> 11:39.266
... an optimal version of myself
then.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.438
I just made some breakfast if
you want
to come in and join us.

11:45.674 --> 11:46.740
I don't want to intrude.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.442
No intrusion at all.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.680
All right, well ...

11:52.246 --> 11:53.781
... I'll finish up here and I'll
come right in.

11:54.114 --> 11:54.915
Great!

11:54.949 --> 11:56.150
I'll bring the dog back in.

12:17.539 --> 12:18.806
Beautiful family, brother.

12:31.352 --> 12:32.687
Beautiful morning, huh?

12:34.556 --> 12:35.422
Terrific.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.793
Peach moonstone!

12:40.662 --> 12:42.062
The woman's stone!

12:43.964 --> 12:45.266
What do you know about crystals?

12:45.299 --> 12:46.900
I know a lot about ...

12:47.669 --> 12:48.435
... a lot.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.373
Peach moonstone is the woman's
stone

12:52.574 --> 12:54.643
combats depression, promotes
fertility.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.977
Yeah. Well, I just like to have
it close by.

12:57.011 --> 12:58.412
It helps me feel balanced.

13:00.548 --> 13:03.083
What was that you were doing
before? Some type of yoga?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.820
Oh. That's just my little
morning routine.

13:07.321 --> 13:09.658
Helps me get enlightened.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.527
And the chanting - was that
Haka?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.663
Dennis and I were abroad in New
Zealand

13:14.696 --> 13:16.598
for a few months while he shot a
movie.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.198
Oh! Which one?

13:19.033 --> 13:20.568
You haven't seen it, it was a
bomb.

13:21.001 --> 13:21.869
Tell me, which one?

13:26.675 --> 13:28.175
"Shallow Lies The Bone."

13:31.412 --> 13:35.115
"Looks like this meat's gone
bad."

13:35.750 --> 13:36.551
Holy shit!

13:36.584 --> 13:37.885
Oh, so you're the one who saw
it.

13:38.385 --> 13:42.256
Well, we had a few film reels at
the hospital.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.559
Yours was the only one with
nudity so

13:44.592 --> 13:46.226
we watched that til it melted!

13:47.127 --> 13:48.429
Are you an actress too?

13:49.096 --> 13:49.863
Uh, no.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.300
She's actually a very talented
figure skater.

13:53.735 --> 13:56.103
She competes and everything,
she's very well known.

13:56.136 --> 13:56.937
Not anymore.

13:57.471 --> 13:58.707
Why not?

14:02.209 --> 14:04.411
What other movies did you have
out there?

14:04.779 --> 14:06.880
Uh, a lot of black and white ...

14:07.649 --> 14:08.750
pig slop.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.385
Nothing comparing to this guy
right here!

14:14.789 --> 14:17.257
Must be nice to be able to watch
your little brother onscreen.

14:17.525 --> 14:19.326
There's no greater pleasure in
the world.

14:20.662 --> 14:21.596
I'm proud of you, Dennis.

14:22.262 --> 14:22.896
I really am.

14:25.800 --> 14:26.433
Thank you.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.608
So Roger, that was Haka?

14:34.007 --> 14:36.544
Oh right, sorry. It's uh ...

14:37.344 --> 14:39.480
a combination of ...

14:40.180 --> 14:41.115
sounds ...

14:41.148 --> 14:42.449
that I ...

14:44.952 --> 14:45.754
made up.

14:46.654 --> 14:48.122
Mostly coming from Aramaic.

14:48.823 --> 14:50.324
Jesus's native tongue.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.024
That's right!

14:51.659 --> 14:53.260
You familiar with the big man?

14:54.461 --> 14:55.764
I've seen some of his work.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.931
You never told me he was
religious.

14:58.132 --> 15:00.100
How would I know? We haven't
talked in years.

15:00.134 --> 15:01.536
I, uh ...

15:02.469 --> 15:03.971
tramped around for a bit.

15:04.873 --> 15:07.441
which gave me an opportunity to
reflect and ...

15:08.543 --> 15:10.377
rearrange my life.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.549
Religion gave me a path to stay
on.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.351
Our grandmother was quite
religious.

15:17.719 --> 15:19.521
And it gives me a ...

15:20.187 --> 15:22.389
way to reconnect with her every
day.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.024
Clear my head ...

15:25.292 --> 15:26.126
get back to earth.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.962
I think that's really sweet.

15:29.864 --> 15:31.599
It's nice to believe in
something.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.202
I miss her.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.378
I'm sorry.

15:46.380 --> 15:50.217
I shouldn't be ruining your good
time with my tears.

15:50.885 --> 15:52.186
It's okay to cry.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.788
Hey.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.088
Why don't you ...

15:55.590 --> 15:57.090
teach me what you were doing out
there.

15:57.491 --> 15:58.827
I could use some enlightenment.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.696
Yeah, I think that's a great
idea. I'll join too.

16:02.630 --> 16:03.430
You would?

16:04.364 --> 16:06.835
Let me put something warmer on.

16:14.876 --> 16:16.076
You're going to enjoy this.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.078
It's very cleansing.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.748
- Let's bring our hips back.

16:21.649 --> 16:23.551
To remind ourselves that

16:23.585 --> 16:25.854
we exist as much behind our
bodies

16:25.887 --> 16:28.121
as we do before our bodies.

16:30.558 --> 16:32.392
Reach our hands up to heaven ...

16:33.862 --> 16:36.564
and bring them back down to our
heart centers ...

16:39.233 --> 16:43.571
and then explore the space
around you to remind yourself

16:44.939 --> 16:46.574
that your life is a sphere.

16:47.775 --> 16:50.879
It exists all around you, not
just on one line.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.449
So let's go up to heaven ...

16:56.283 --> 16:57.685
back to our hearts ...

16:58.485 --> 16:59.687
through the sphere.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.422
Arms up to heaven ...

17:03.892 --> 17:05.158
back to our hearts ...

17:06.694 --> 17:08.228
around in a sphere.

17:09.263 --> 17:10.430
You want to breathe

17:11.398 --> 17:12.266
from your gut.

17:29.817 --> 17:30.618
You got it.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.319
You can do this.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.857
Now, to really ground ourselves
into the earth

17:36.991 --> 17:40.028
we're going to push down into
the earth with both hands

17:40.662 --> 17:41.729
and with our knees.

17:52.507 --> 17:54.141
These grounds are sacred.

17:55.009 --> 17:56.109
Spiritual even.

17:57.612 --> 18:00.048
That might explain the guy in
the robe at the lake.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.151
What guy in a robe? You didn't
tell me about that.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.621
The monks.

18:07.655 --> 18:10.758
There's a monastery just on the
other side of the lake.

18:12.660 --> 18:15.063
Sometimes they wander onto our
trails over here.

18:15.530 --> 18:16.831
They're totally harmless.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.733
Those little monks.

18:19.667 --> 18:22.537
They really give you the creeps
the first time you see them.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.525
Okay.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.527
Can I ...

18:46.828 --> 18:49.262
can I show you guys something
really, really cool?

18:49.931 --> 18:50.932
Sure!

18:54.234 --> 18:55.503
Close your eyes and open your
mouth.

18:56.738 --> 18:57.505
Excuse me?

18:57.538 --> 18:58.673
Just trust me, please.

18:58.706 --> 19:00.240
This is gonna help you with your
withdrawals.

19:01.009 --> 19:01.876
How did you know?

19:03.945 --> 19:04.912
I can smell it.

19:05.713 --> 19:07.081
I'm very intuative.

19:07.115 --> 19:08.883
This is nature's aid, just trust
me, please.

19:09.617 --> 19:11.586
Close your eyes, stick our your
tongues.

19:11.953 --> 19:12.954
It's totally harmless.

19:36.544 --> 19:38.880
Mmm. What is that?

19:38.913 --> 19:41.214
I call these "Benedictine
Berries."

19:41.549 --> 19:43.117
I don't remember these being
here.

19:43.551 --> 19:46.054
I know, they must have started
growing here the past few years.

19:46.087 --> 19:48.188
I'll make you a tea later, binds
the stomach

19:48.221 --> 19:49.590
really helpful for what you're
going through.

19:50.958 --> 19:51.726
Appreciate it.

19:53.127 --> 19:55.429
Okay. Can I show you our
favorite spot?

20:05.807 --> 20:06.674
You hear that?

20:07.975 --> 20:08.743
Hear what?

20:11.278 --> 20:11.979
Nothing.

20:14.916 --> 20:16.316
Close your eyes. Just ...

20:18.251 --> 20:18.920
be.

20:23.658 --> 20:25.492
Feels like you're in outer
space.

20:50.618 --> 20:52.486
Do the monks ever come to the
house?

20:53.788 --> 20:56.724
Not sure. It's good to have them
around, though.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.960
This area's so desolate.

20:59.794 --> 21:02.496
Mostly summer homes people
abandon
for ten months out of the year.

21:02.530 --> 21:05.066
It's not uncommon to find
squatters living in your house.

21:05.833 --> 21:06.834
It's happened here.

21:08.169 --> 21:12.173
You'd hope the monks act a bit
like scarecrows in that sense.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.110
Is that why you don't skate
anymore?

21:51.112 --> 21:52.280
I thought I was alone.

21:54.215 --> 21:56.250
That's the piece of you that's
missing.

21:56.717 --> 21:57.585
Excuse me?

22:01.856 --> 22:03.356
I sensed that ...

22:04.792 --> 22:06.961
You're not ... full.

22:08.095 --> 22:09.230
Dennis is obvious.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.933
You are ...

22:13.100 --> 22:14.467
tougher to crack.

22:16.537 --> 22:17.370
What happened?

22:19.240 --> 22:20.407
It happened last year.

22:21.474 --> 22:24.444
I ... had a partner and ...

22:25.478 --> 22:28.649
We were practcing one day, doing
an overhead lift

22:29.817 --> 22:30.785
And he just ...

22:31.786 --> 22:32.553
dropped me.

22:34.255 --> 22:35.923
He said it was an accident, but...

22:38.726 --> 22:41.629
Anyway, I haven't been able to
stand on one foot ever since.

22:54.441 --> 22:58.145
I can't even imagine how hard it
is

22:58.179 --> 23:01.148
to trust anyone after something
like that.

23:03.517 --> 23:06.453
We have to be at peace ...

23:07.989 --> 23:09.257
in ourselves ...

23:10.691 --> 23:11.759
if we want to ...

23:13.361 --> 23:15.696
be able to help somebody else to
heal.

23:22.336 --> 23:23.037
Mia.

23:26.040 --> 23:30.678
The road to recovery, it's not
... it's not a solo journey.

23:35.549 --> 23:36.651
Can we try something?

23:37.985 --> 23:39.053
Relax your neck.

23:43.157 --> 23:44.158
And close your eyes.

23:47.328 --> 23:48.495
You're in charge here.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.402
Mia, I can see a ...

23:55.569 --> 23:56.837
tiny, little ...

23:58.172 --> 24:00.041
soul. A spirit.

24:01.809 --> 24:03.177
Floating around you.

24:05.079 --> 24:07.181
Trying to reconnect with your
soul.

24:11.152 --> 24:12.586
Put your hands on my shoulders.

24:17.224 --> 24:18.392
Now repeat after me.

24:20.528 --> 24:22.897
"Abatur, Abathur."

24:23.664 --> 24:26.033
"Abatur, Abathur."

24:26.600 --> 24:30.504
"Bukra, Ahrima, Buzrana."

24:31.038 --> 24:34.342
"Bukra, Ahrima, Buzrana."

24:34.775 --> 24:37.912
"Shiruna, Niaka."

24:38.746 --> 24:41.048
"Shiruna, Niaka."

24:45.619 --> 24:46.454
Okay.

24:49.056 --> 24:50.624
Okay, come here.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.402
It's all a process.

25:05.106 --> 25:06.574
We can't hold onto this.

25:07.141 --> 25:09.110
You can't keep all this inside
of you.

25:09.977 --> 25:10.945
Give me your arms.

25:13.280 --> 25:14.115
Lean back.

25:16.417 --> 25:17.218
Lie down.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.153
Rest.

25:23.391 --> 25:24.325
Fall

25:26.127 --> 25:27.094
into

25:28.629 --> 25:30.164
your emotions.

25:34.435 --> 25:35.236
Why'd you do that?

25:36.070 --> 25:37.004
You looked comfortable.

25:37.304 --> 25:38.272
And that bothered you?

25:39.840 --> 25:41.510
Wanted to catch you away from
the lady.

25:43.411 --> 25:44.645
How long have you been off the
stuff?

25:46.947 --> 25:47.648
About a week.

25:49.350 --> 25:51.185
Seems like it doesn't want to
let me go this time.

25:51.819 --> 25:52.853
Shakes and shivers?

25:54.121 --> 25:54.855
Vomiting.

25:55.923 --> 25:56.824
Nightmares.

25:58.259 --> 25:59.794
Never lasted this long before.

26:00.861 --> 26:02.696
Well, no two times could be
alike.

26:05.132 --> 26:09.170
You know, sometimes, cold turkey
isn't the way to go.

26:10.104 --> 26:11.372
Your body is weak

26:12.339 --> 26:13.474
and so is your spirit.

26:15.676 --> 26:17.011
This little retreat?

26:18.879 --> 26:21.215
Isn't gonna bring you back
together, the damage is done.

26:21.482 --> 26:23.117
What the fuck are you talking
about?

26:26.487 --> 26:27.721
You wanna hit me?

26:28.122 --> 26:29.356
What?

26:30.458 --> 26:32.326
Do you want to kill me?

26:35.129 --> 26:36.163
Here.

26:37.031 --> 26:37.798
Take these.

26:40.334 --> 26:41.503
Mia doesn't have to know.

26:42.803 --> 26:44.705
You can keep on ruining her
life.

27:05.025 --> 27:08.729
Thank you Lord for this
bounteous meal, for your
everlasting grace,

27:08.762 --> 27:10.764
for reuniting our family.

27:11.499 --> 27:14.135
To you we give our greatest
sacrifice.

27:14.168 --> 27:19.206
May our great grandchildren tell
stories of our love.

27:19.707 --> 27:21.576
May they know us, may you know
us, amen.

27:22.076 --> 27:22.743
Amen.

27:26.914 --> 27:27.715
Amen.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.762
When did your grandfather build
this place?

27:45.065 --> 27:47.536
You haven't told her much of the
family history, have you?

27:48.302 --> 27:49.638
Only the greatest hits.

27:50.204 --> 27:53.007
Well, this place used to be a
hunting lodge

27:53.040 --> 27:54.708
all alone on the land.

27:55.042 --> 28:00.714
Our grandfather was doing some
legal work
for the monastery back in the
1940s.

28:00.915 --> 28:02.617
He wanted a little place that

28:02.651 --> 28:05.085
the whole family could be
together in.

28:06.220 --> 28:07.955
But you know how life goes,

28:07.988 --> 28:09.723
people grow up, get better lives
and ...

28:10.791 --> 28:12.627
forget about those they love.

28:13.562 --> 28:17.566
Dennis! Boy oh boy would he be
proud of the life you're living.

28:23.337 --> 28:27.107
Mia, do you think you'll make it
back out on the ice?

28:27.975 --> 28:29.310
Not anytime soon.

28:30.811 --> 28:33.147
Well, I bet you're an angel out
there.

28:33.747 --> 28:34.748
She is.

28:35.650 --> 28:37.985
And she will be. Again.

28:40.254 --> 28:41.255
Excuse me.

28:51.832 --> 28:52.933
Did I say something?

28:53.367 --> 28:54.802
Stop bringing it up, all right?

28:58.506 --> 28:59.173
Okay.

29:11.653 --> 29:12.353
You okay?

29:13.020 --> 29:14.855
Sure. Just needed a refill.

29:17.692 --> 29:22.396
So Dennis - anything on the
horizon? Any movies coming up?

29:22.896 --> 29:23.864
Who knows, man.

29:26.568 --> 29:27.569
Well, geez.

29:28.202 --> 29:31.372
Y'all sure don't wanna talk
about too much.

29:31.573 --> 29:33.708
Can I just sit here and enjoy a
meal with my family

29:33.742 --> 29:35.843
and not talk about my career for
once?

29:38.513 --> 29:39.813
Are you hiding something?

29:39.847 --> 29:40.981
Shut up, Roger.

29:41.015 --> 29:43.284
Don't tell him to shut up, it's
not nice.

29:43.317 --> 29:45.587
We're trying to relax, he keeps
making us uncomfortable.

29:47.421 --> 29:49.658
If something I'm saying is
making you uncomfortable

29:49.691 --> 29:51.458
I invite you to look inside
yourself

29:51.492 --> 29:52.727
and see why that might be.

29:53.662 --> 29:54.562
Why don't we just start over?

29:55.329 --> 29:56.531
Everyone play nice.

29:57.231 --> 29:58.332
Fine.

30:04.673 --> 30:07.174
You know, I find fear of
inadequacy is a common--

30:07.207 --> 30:08.677
You think I feel inadequate?

30:09.076 --> 30:10.110
All right.

30:10.512 --> 30:13.247
From my perspective, what you
do, your job ...

30:13.515 --> 30:16.984
You've gotta convince yourself
you're special enough

30:17.017 --> 30:19.086
that people are gonna want to
pay money

30:19.119 --> 30:23.357
to sit and look at your face for
two or more hours at a time.

30:23.390 --> 30:25.459
Constantly hoping that people
like you?

30:26.460 --> 30:28.429
It's enough to make anybody feel
inadequate.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.270
I'm not trying to be offensive!
I'm just trying to help you

30:37.271 --> 30:39.273
understand why you might feel
the way that you do.

30:39.306 --> 30:40.742
I can see you struggling with
it.

30:41.241 --> 30:42.409
Thanks for the help, Roger.

30:53.153 --> 30:55.489
You wanna slice them as thin as
possible.

30:56.223 --> 30:58.926
No, not like that. You have to
be gentle.

30:59.493 --> 31:01.161
Nice and slow.

31:02.831 --> 31:04.632
And don't lose any of the seeds

31:04.666 --> 31:06.568
cause that's where magic comes
from.

31:17.244 --> 31:18.847
What are you looking for,
ghosts?

31:19.581 --> 31:20.749
Thought I saw something.

31:23.183 --> 31:24.318
Here.

31:41.201 --> 31:42.102
Tart.

31:42.136 --> 31:44.037
The properties change when you
boil 'em.

31:44.539 --> 31:45.939
But the effects are more
beneficial.

31:45.973 --> 31:47.374
Coats the stomach lining.

31:51.011 --> 31:52.112
I need a cigarette.

32:05.058 --> 32:08.663
It must be tough for you to see
him like this.

32:09.329 --> 32:10.364
He'll get through it.

32:14.569 --> 32:19.139
Well, he's certainly lucky to
have a woman like you by his
side.

32:21.709 --> 32:22.777
Ow!

32:23.010 --> 32:23.778
Are you all right?

32:23.812 --> 32:25.479
Yeah, I just burned myself.

32:26.413 --> 32:27.481
Come here.

32:33.721 --> 32:35.222
You really didn't have to make
this for us.

32:36.858 --> 32:37.892
It's my pleasure.

32:38.593 --> 32:40.060
I had a buddy who was trying to
get off dope

32:40.093 --> 32:41.763
I made this for him three times
a day.

32:42.831 --> 32:43.565
It's the best.

32:44.866 --> 32:46.166
I'd try anything at this point.

32:48.903 --> 32:50.538
Ooh! I love this song!

33:54.067 --> 33:55.135
Sorry.

33:57.170 --> 33:58.740
Don't stop on my account.

34:00.173 --> 34:02.309
Please. Continue dancing with my
wife.

34:03.011 --> 34:04.311
It's fine. Come here.

34:11.451 --> 34:12.921
Sorry. I'm sorry.

34:21.029 --> 34:22.296
We were just having some fun.

34:22.697 --> 34:23.497
What'd I do?

34:37.011 --> 34:37.812
What do you want?

34:38.111 --> 34:39.614
I just want to apologize.

34:39.647 --> 34:41.281
You should be apologizing to
your brother.

34:41.849 --> 34:42.884
Why?

34:43.150 --> 34:46.020
Because he's been so kind and
you embarassed him.

34:46.353 --> 34:47.655
I was just sitting there.

34:48.188 --> 34:49.857
Yeah. With that look on your
face.

34:50.558 --> 34:52.694
He was dancing with you without
my permission.

34:52.727 --> 34:54.796
Don't you think he's the one who
should be apologizing?

34:55.195 --> 34:57.966
And you. I've never seen you act
that way with a stranger before.

34:58.332 --> 35:00.400
Well, he's not a stranger. He's
your brother.

35:01.536 --> 35:04.338
Can I just have a little fun for
once? For one night?

35:09.978 --> 35:12.379
If I go apologize to him, will
that make you feel better?

35:13.047 --> 35:14.147
Might make him feel better.

35:14.649 --> 35:15.817
Great.

35:16.416 --> 35:17.585
He's going to ruin this whole
trip.

35:18.485 --> 35:19.654
Watch.

35:24.692 --> 35:25.492
Hey, man.

35:25.526 --> 35:26.326
Give me one second!

35:46.914 --> 35:47.682
Sorry.

35:48.916 --> 35:49.884
It's fine.

35:52.419 --> 35:57.091
I was actually coming to
apologize to you if I was rude
earlier.

36:01.428 --> 36:02.597
You're not mad at me?

36:03.531 --> 36:04.766
No.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.268
I'm not feeling well. You know?

36:14.474 --> 36:16.911
Can I have a hug? I need a good
one.

36:17.145 --> 36:18.245
What?

36:22.449 --> 36:25.553
Reconnection has to happen
physically as well as
emotionally.

36:28.790 --> 36:29.423
That's good.

36:30.625 --> 36:32.660
That's good, that's good.

36:39.767 --> 36:40.434
Goodnight.

36:48.576 --> 36:49.242
Well?

36:50.144 --> 36:51.646
Did he accept your apology?

36:53.480 --> 36:54.982
That he did.

36:55.482 --> 36:56.249
Good.

36:56.283 --> 36:58.052
I'm getting hot flashes.

36:58.086 --> 37:01.122
Yeah, you look pale. You want
some water?

37:01.155 --> 37:01.956
No.

37:02.355 --> 37:04.625
Let's just lay and be together.

37:14.702 --> 37:16.771
Sorry if I made you
uncomfortable earlier.

37:18.139 --> 37:19.974
Sorry if I ever make you
uncomfortable.

37:20.942 --> 37:21.776
I love you.

37:22.777 --> 37:23.511
I know you do.

37:27.515 --> 37:29.316
It's just weird being in the
house with him.

37:30.184 --> 37:30.985
Why?

37:31.953 --> 37:33.121
It's been a long time.

37:34.021 --> 37:35.656
He has this new persona.

37:36.824 --> 37:39.627
It's different. You wouldn't
understand.

37:40.728 --> 37:43.363
He used to be such a malevolent
person when we were younger.

37:44.832 --> 37:46.466
Well, maybe he's changed.

37:47.235 --> 37:49.237
You should give him the benefit
of the doubt.

37:49.871 --> 37:51.672
Tigers don't change their
stripes.

37:52.405 --> 37:54.208
Is that what you want people to
think about you?

38:00.181 --> 38:02.216
What's going to happen when we
go back to the city?

38:03.017 --> 38:03.885
What do you mean?

38:05.987 --> 38:07.722
I just want to know where your
head's at.

38:09.322 --> 38:11.692
I really can't be thinking of
that right now.

38:14.195 --> 38:14.862
Fine.

38:15.530 --> 38:17.532
But I want to have a plan before
we leave.

38:17.999 --> 38:20.601
Okay, I'm just not going to be
of any use right now.

38:21.569 --> 38:22.904
Okay?

38:22.937 --> 38:24.105
Okay.

39:15.756 --> 39:17.959
- Dennis hates animals.

39:17.992 --> 39:24.632
- Dennis with his fake life and
his fake hair and his fake
friends.
- Dennis with his fake career.

39:24.999 --> 39:26.267
What are you doing?

39:26.300 --> 39:28.102
Shh!

39:32.573 --> 39:33.641
Did you not just hear that?

39:34.075 --> 39:35.475
I didn't hear anything.

39:35.509 --> 39:36.611
Shh! Listen!

39:40.915 --> 39:42.049
I don't hear anything.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.651
I just heard my brother and some
other people

39:43.684 --> 39:44.952
talking about me in his room.

39:45.253 --> 39:47.188
What other people? It's just us
here.

39:48.022 --> 39:49.690
- You need to come back to bed.
- No. No I don't.

39:50.791 --> 39:51.424
Come here.

40:01.535 --> 40:02.169
Listen.

40:08.175 --> 40:12.046
It sounds like a deviated
septum. He's snoring.

41:34.061 --> 41:35.696
You were talking in your sleep.

41:38.966 --> 41:39.734
I was?

41:41.135 --> 41:44.271
I could hear you. I wanted to
make sure you're all right.

41:45.206 --> 41:47.608
Oh yeah. Just tired I guess.

41:49.944 --> 41:50.978
I'm sure you were.

41:52.213 --> 41:53.881
After everything you've been
through.

41:55.816 --> 41:58.119
Where are you? I can't see you.

42:05.793 --> 42:07.962
We've been waiting for someone
like you.

42:12.666 --> 42:14.235
You're so warm.

42:16.404 --> 42:18.639
I can smell the heat from your
blood.

42:20.007 --> 42:20.775
Mia?

42:21.909 --> 42:22.743
I swear.

42:23.344 --> 42:24.178
Take this.

42:28.082 --> 42:30.317
I'm really tripping bad, here.

42:32.186 --> 42:34.355
You're the reason we lost the
child.

42:34.789 --> 42:35.623
What?

42:36.323 --> 42:37.925
It's all your fault.

42:38.926 --> 42:40.795
I'm so sorry, baby.

42:40.828 --> 42:42.296
Saying that isn't enough.

42:57.378 --> 42:58.279
Dennis.

43:01.315 --> 43:02.517
Baby, are you all right?

43:02.950 --> 43:04.985
I don't understand. What?

43:05.486 --> 43:07.188
You were just having a
nightmare. It's okay.

43:09.824 --> 43:11.992
- I'm gonna run you a shower,
okay? You need to wake up.
- Okay.

43:12.561 --> 43:13.327
Okay.

43:23.572 --> 43:25.239
That's some booby trap you
built.

43:30.845 --> 43:33.582
It's my house too, you know. It
was a 50/50 split.

43:34.081 --> 43:35.082
No, I just ...

43:36.684 --> 43:38.419
I thought I heard something. I
got spooked.

43:42.156 --> 43:45.693
You know, it's normal to enter a
state of psycosis when going
through withdrawals.

43:48.429 --> 43:49.897
Hope it doesn't become
permanent.

43:53.934 --> 43:56.538
Come outside when you're ready.
Could use your help with
something.

44:43.083 --> 44:44.251
What are you hiding from me?

44:44.885 --> 44:45.753
What do you mean?

44:45.786 --> 44:47.054
What do I mean?

44:48.889 --> 44:49.857
What's this?

44:49.890 --> 44:50.758
It's just a book.

44:51.058 --> 44:52.459
It's a pregnancy book I found.

44:58.265 --> 44:59.568
Maybe I should have a look at
it.

45:04.438 --> 45:05.507
You seem a lot better.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.076
The whole point of this weekend
is for us to reconnect.

45:09.109 --> 45:11.580
Can we please do something just
the two of us?

45:11.912 --> 45:12.647
Okay.

45:13.781 --> 45:14.915
Let me put on a sweater.

45:27.428 --> 45:28.663
Where are you lovebirds headed?

45:28.996 --> 45:30.798
Just going to get some fresh air
on our own for a bit.

45:31.799 --> 45:33.602
Don't let the dog out. Okay?

45:35.169 --> 45:36.036
Groovy.

45:36.937 --> 45:38.038
What are you thinking about?

45:39.306 --> 45:41.875
Just how we were before
everything.

45:42.476 --> 45:43.310
How so?

45:45.112 --> 45:46.280
Before the success.

45:47.047 --> 45:48.683
How we used to spend all day at
the movies

45:48.717 --> 45:50.150
without a care in the world.

45:51.285 --> 45:54.221
Eating oatmeal for every single
meal.

45:54.656 --> 45:55.789
The oatmeal days.

45:56.658 --> 45:57.791
That was something then.

46:00.127 --> 46:02.363
Well ... had to grow up at some
point.

46:03.897 --> 46:06.467
Tell me about the film. I wanna
hear about it.

46:07.201 --> 46:09.638
I don't know. Something about...

46:10.337 --> 46:12.473
rangers in Colorado or ...

46:13.708 --> 46:16.143
I don't know. I don't know.

46:16.176 --> 46:17.444
Your agent says it's good?

46:17.478 --> 46:18.680
Yeah. Yeah.

46:21.415 --> 46:22.149
All right.

46:24.251 --> 46:24.985
Sorry.

46:28.322 --> 46:31.492
I want to focus on us right now.
You know, be in the moment?

46:32.594 --> 46:33.327
Okay.

46:33.994 --> 46:36.230
Well right now, we're sitting on
this bench

46:36.263 --> 46:39.433
and I'm thinking about how
peaceful it is here.

46:40.434 --> 46:42.102
Maybe it's time we moved out of
the city.

46:42.604 --> 46:44.004
Laid some roots somewhere.

46:44.338 --> 46:45.272
Like where?

46:45.707 --> 46:46.541
Anywhere.

46:47.908 --> 46:50.244
What about when I have work?
Meetings?

46:51.078 --> 46:53.347
There's commuter towns. You can
hop on a train.

46:53.881 --> 46:56.083
I'm not going to be one of those
women lugging

46:56.116 --> 46:59.621
three children onto a crowded
subway in 100 degree weather.

47:01.255 --> 47:03.857
It's stressful enough as it is
living in the city.

47:04.124 --> 47:07.361
I want our kids to wake up in
the morning and breathe fresh
air

47:07.861 --> 47:11.065
and I want them to be able to
look up at the stars when they
go to sleep.

47:11.965 --> 47:14.468
There's just too many dangers in
the city.

47:16.103 --> 47:16.904
What do you mean?

47:18.238 --> 47:19.039
You know what I mean.

47:19.541 --> 47:21.275
You don't want them to end up
like me?

47:22.943 --> 47:23.944
That's not what I said.

47:23.977 --> 47:25.446
Well then what are you saying?

47:25.479 --> 47:27.549
I'm saying there's a lot of
temptation in the city.

47:27.816 --> 47:29.983
You're exposed to a lot, it's
not normal.

47:33.087 --> 47:34.254
Why are you being this way?

47:34.288 --> 47:36.056
We've always talked about moving
out to the country.

47:36.090 --> 47:38.025
I just don't think we're exactly
there yet.

47:38.058 --> 47:38.793
How so?

47:39.627 --> 47:42.129
In case you forgot, I just got
fired from my TV show

47:42.162 --> 47:44.031
so that money's not coming in
anymore.

47:44.064 --> 47:45.800
Okay, well you have this new
film.

47:45.834 --> 47:47.836
I told you, I don't want to talk
about that!

47:48.335 --> 47:49.937
Why are you being like this?

47:52.574 --> 47:53.273
Dennis.

47:54.007 --> 47:54.642
Look at me.

47:55.844 --> 47:56.477
Look at me!

47:59.781 --> 48:00.414
It's me.

48:01.081 --> 48:02.149
I'm your best friend.

48:03.016 --> 48:05.787
If there's something bothering
you, you need to tell me.

48:06.019 --> 48:07.287
That way, I can help you.

48:08.088 --> 48:10.290
I can't help you if you dont let
me in.

48:12.694 --> 48:13.595
I love you.

48:15.195 --> 48:16.029
To the moon.

48:22.369 --> 48:24.506
Damnit, I told him not to let
him out!

48:30.377 --> 48:32.814
Looks like that fresh air did
you some good!

48:33.648 --> 48:34.816
What is he barking at?

48:35.182 --> 48:37.484
I don't know. He's been going at
it for a while, though.

48:45.693 --> 48:46.528
Panny?

48:47.060 --> 48:48.663
Panny, boy, whatcha got there,
bud?

48:50.197 --> 48:50.899
Dennis?

48:59.808 --> 49:00.775
What is this?

49:00.809 --> 49:01.910
- What do you mean?
- Is this yours?

49:02.209 --> 49:03.310
What is that thing?

49:04.311 --> 49:05.412
Dennis!

49:05.647 --> 49:07.114
Are you messing with me?

49:07.147 --> 49:08.348
I'm not fucking around here!

49:08.382 --> 49:09.551
Mia, what is he talking about?

49:09.584 --> 49:10.484
He had a nightmare.

49:10.518 --> 49:11.686
You were wearing this last
night!

49:11.719 --> 49:13.353
I was in my room all night last
night!

49:13.387 --> 49:15.355
You set up those traps,
remember?

49:15.723 --> 49:16.758
You would have heard something!

49:18.593 --> 49:19.393
Lemme look at it.

49:23.163 --> 49:25.399
Nothing has ever been solved
with violence!

49:28.035 --> 49:29.236
Where did this come from?

49:34.408 --> 49:35.209
Let me show you something.

49:42.550 --> 49:43.350
See, look at this.

49:45.118 --> 49:46.588
There's a college nearby.

49:48.923 --> 49:51.793
These college kids are out here
every weekend.

49:52.894 --> 49:54.294
Having beer parties ...

49:55.362 --> 49:56.363
Look at this!

49:56.598 --> 49:57.397
Is that ...

49:57.431 --> 49:59.868
That's the same hair from that
wig.

50:14.147 --> 50:15.382
Fuck!

50:20.320 --> 50:21.623
Am I going crazy?

50:22.155 --> 50:23.457
No, baby.

50:27.094 --> 50:29.296
I need to take a walk. Clear my
head.

50:30.665 --> 50:32.065
I'll see you back at the house.

50:37.739 --> 50:38.840
He'll be fine.

51:35.563 --> 51:36.330
Thirsty?

51:38.365 --> 51:39.299
No, thank you.

51:51.178 --> 51:52.647
Are you trying to ...

51:53.246 --> 51:54.181
get pregnant?

51:56.483 --> 51:57.417
Sorry, what?

51:58.720 --> 52:00.088
I noticed a book missing.

52:01.154 --> 52:02.056
Oh.

52:09.496 --> 52:11.766
That's ... it's fine. You keep
it.

52:23.111 --> 52:24.177
You're young.

52:28.916 --> 52:31.519
Seeds get pollinated

52:32.754 --> 52:33.955
when they're ready.

52:36.456 --> 52:37.692
When the time is right ...

52:39.594 --> 52:40.695
it'll be right.

52:43.765 --> 52:45.533
You think the timing wasn't
right?

52:46.734 --> 52:49.103
You're walking around with

52:49.137 --> 52:51.405
an anvil on your back.

52:52.874 --> 52:54.042
You need to ...

52:55.076 --> 52:56.077
let go ...

52:56.944 --> 52:58.579
and put your faith in order.

53:00.048 --> 53:01.582
Stop weighing yourself down.

53:09.590 --> 53:10.290
Keep the book.

54:07.014 --> 54:07.715
How are you feeling?

54:08.950 --> 54:09.650
Much better.

54:11.052 --> 54:12.120
Could we talk?

54:13.154 --> 54:14.021
Sure. What's up?

54:14.822 --> 54:16.190
I just want to apologize.

54:16.724 --> 54:19.326
For my behavior ... and
everything.

54:21.394 --> 54:22.362
From here on out ...

54:23.731 --> 54:24.632
fresh start.

54:27.201 --> 54:29.203
I'm all about fresh starts.

54:30.037 --> 54:31.404
You got yourself a deal,
partner.

54:35.342 --> 54:36.077
Why are you digging?

54:36.811 --> 54:40.548
We've got a bad case of Castor
canadensis out here.

54:41.015 --> 54:43.251
- Castor cana-dance?
- North American beaver.

54:43.684 --> 54:46.087
Man, you've really forgotten
your roots.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.857
Hollywood's changed you. You
city people ...

54:50.992 --> 54:54.028
you've got no idea how
troublesome a beaver could be.

54:54.061 --> 54:56.697
- Uh huh.
- I trap 'em, and I poison 'em.

54:57.231 --> 54:58.431
You can sell their tails.

54:59.767 --> 55:00.868
They're using them for ...

55:02.069 --> 55:03.938
food flavoring? Something like
that.

55:06.107 --> 55:08.709
Hey, how about we switch spots
for a little bit?

55:09.376 --> 55:11.344
Not so sure you want to be me
right now.

55:12.914 --> 55:14.582
You could use a little time in
the earth.

55:17.285 --> 55:18.119
All right.

55:23.591 --> 55:25.392
You think you can dig as deep as
I did?

55:26.359 --> 55:27.695
I think I can handle a foot.

55:28.596 --> 55:29.462
You look pretty weak.

55:30.531 --> 55:31.899
I'm not as weak as I look.

55:32.900 --> 55:33.701
You wanna bet?

55:34.235 --> 55:34.902
How much?

55:35.703 --> 55:37.038
I don't like to bet with money.

55:37.404 --> 55:39.040
Well, that's all I got, beaver
boy.

55:40.407 --> 55:41.242
Is it?

55:42.710 --> 55:43.410
Fifty bucks?

55:44.111 --> 55:44.979
Think you can handle that?

55:46.547 --> 55:48.549
Fifty bucks'll last you a long
time out here.

55:48.583 --> 55:49.217
You won't have to ...

55:50.117 --> 55:51.319
sell any beaver tail.

55:53.453 --> 55:54.088
All right.

55:54.655 --> 55:55.422
Deal.

56:28.856 --> 56:30.958
What's the matter, Mr.
Hollywood?

56:31.325 --> 56:32.660
Need your stunt double?

56:33.361 --> 56:34.962
Knock it off!

56:38.966 --> 56:41.202
Whoa, dude! What are you,
fucking nuts?

56:41.501 --> 56:42.603
That's poison!

56:42.970 --> 56:43.971
What?

56:44.005 --> 56:45.039
Drop it!

56:47.708 --> 56:48.976
Go wash your hands!

56:53.681 --> 56:54.949
I was just playing.

58:05.786 --> 58:06.887
Anything interesting?

58:08.289 --> 58:09.256
Weird book.

58:10.725 --> 58:11.892
Come lay down with me for a
minute.

58:13.260 --> 58:14.195
All right.

58:29.944 --> 58:30.945
How are you feeling?

58:31.912 --> 58:32.613
Better.

58:36.650 --> 58:39.453
Do you want to continue our
conversation?

58:40.921 --> 58:43.057
I don't want to think about real
life right now.

58:44.291 --> 58:44.992
All right.

58:48.596 --> 58:49.330
You mad at me?

58:50.297 --> 58:51.098
Nope.

58:52.166 --> 58:53.834
You sure you're not mad at me?

58:54.935 --> 58:55.803
I'm sure.

59:01.142 --> 59:03.611
I just had to get away from the
house to think.

59:04.745 --> 59:08.149
I acted like a real jerk
earlier. And I'm sorry.

59:10.251 --> 59:12.319
Dinner's ready! Come get it
while it's hot!

59:13.154 --> 59:14.055
What?

59:14.088 --> 59:14.822
He made us dinner?

59:17.324 --> 59:18.325
What a sweetheart.

59:20.628 --> 59:22.129
What's all this for?

59:22.363 --> 59:25.266
I feel terrible that I wasn't
able to be at your wedding.

59:25.699 --> 59:29.837
So I thought we could have our
own little celebration here and
now.

59:30.137 --> 59:31.705
I don't know what to say.

59:32.273 --> 59:33.474
I wish I had nicer clothes.

59:34.642 --> 59:35.643
You look perfect.

59:37.344 --> 59:38.513
Is that Grandma's handkerchief?

59:39.514 --> 59:40.147
Yes.

59:41.782 --> 59:42.716
Looks good on you, Rog.

59:44.185 --> 59:45.186
Thanks.

59:50.224 --> 59:51.560
Thank you, Roger.

1:00:03.304 --> 1:00:04.506
Is something wrong with the
food?

1:00:05.372 --> 1:00:06.006
No.

1:00:06.508 --> 1:00:08.642
It's strange, I just don't have
much of an appetite.

1:00:10.311 --> 1:00:11.378
Can I ask you something?

1:00:12.313 --> 1:00:13.013
Shoot.

1:00:14.248 --> 1:00:16.383
We're not eating beaver, are we?

1:00:20.555 --> 1:00:21.989
No. Of course not.

1:00:22.423 --> 1:00:23.558
What are you guys talking about?

1:00:24.258 --> 1:00:27.795
Apparently, Roger's been hunting
and selling beavers in town.

1:00:27.828 --> 1:00:30.030
Really living off the land.

1:00:31.332 --> 1:00:32.399
Does that make you happy?

1:00:33.701 --> 1:00:34.435
I don't mind it.

1:00:35.570 --> 1:00:37.705
Well, if that makes you happy
then I think that's great.

1:00:37.738 --> 1:00:42.176
Speaking of happiness, there's
an ice rink not far from here.

1:00:42.511 --> 1:00:45.479
I bet you could teach lessons.
Heck -

1:00:45.514 --> 1:00:47.915
With your expertise, you could
be running the joint.

1:00:48.716 --> 1:00:50.885
We're actually going back to the
city.

1:00:52.019 --> 1:00:53.988
You should think about coming
with us, I mean, I could

1:00:54.021 --> 1:00:56.223
probably set you up with
something, make some real money.

1:00:56.457 --> 1:00:58.459
You know, not be living off of
dead animals.

1:00:58.926 --> 1:01:00.294
Does that make you happy?

1:01:01.128 --> 1:01:01.862
Does what?

1:01:02.296 --> 1:01:03.931
Making lots of money.

1:01:04.698 --> 1:01:08.903
Oh, I don't think it's
everything but I think it
certainly helps.

1:01:09.236 --> 1:01:10.804
I'm not like you, Dennis.

1:01:12.072 --> 1:01:14.141
I've got everything I need right
here.

1:01:14.708 --> 1:01:15.943
Shelter, food ...

1:01:16.911 --> 1:01:19.079
- ... comfort.
- Yeah, I agree with Roger.

1:01:20.915 --> 1:01:22.750
I'm just saying I could help
you.

1:01:24.985 --> 1:01:27.121
I didn't ask for your help,
Dennis.

1:01:28.122 --> 1:01:29.558
I don't want to be ...

1:01:30.424 --> 1:01:32.893
... in debt. To my little
brother.

1:01:32.927 --> 1:01:34.596
You wouldn't be indebted to me,
man.

1:01:35.496 --> 1:01:37.031
Am I being out of line?

1:01:37.064 --> 1:01:38.332
I know who my savior is.

1:01:40.167 --> 1:01:41.001
And it ain't you.

1:01:41.035 --> 1:01:42.403
Here we go with the religious
shit.

1:01:42.436 --> 1:01:45.806
Look Dennis, I have my own
identity.

1:01:46.974 --> 1:01:50.144
I've worked really hard to
become this person

1:01:50.177 --> 1:01:52.746
and I'm happy with myself.

1:01:53.781 --> 1:01:56.250
You think you've got me fooled
with this new, reformed

1:01:56.283 --> 1:01:58.620
hippie-dippy woo-woo act you've
got going on?

1:01:58.852 --> 1:02:01.488
Cause I know the real you,
Roger. Don't forget that.

1:02:02.189 --> 1:02:02.923
Dennis.

1:02:03.257 --> 1:02:05.527
He was the complete opposite
when we were kids.

1:02:06.293 --> 1:02:09.163
Tell her about when I was six
and you threw me off the
treehouse.

1:02:09.531 --> 1:02:11.232
I broke my arm in three places.
Or what about

1:02:11.265 --> 1:02:13.300
after Grandpa passed and you
pawned off

1:02:13.334 --> 1:02:15.769
all the jewelry Grandma managed
to save from Hungary?

1:02:15.803 --> 1:02:17.404
What about that? Tell her about
that.

1:02:17.438 --> 1:02:20.441
You're clearly making your wife
uncomfortable. It's all right,
Mia.

1:02:20.474 --> 1:02:21.842
Don't tell her "it's all right!"

1:02:23.177 --> 1:02:24.878
What are you really doing here?

1:02:26.213 --> 1:02:30.317
You magically reappear after
years and years of silence?

1:02:30.685 --> 1:02:31.785
What do you want?

1:02:32.419 --> 1:02:34.656
I don't know if you've looked
around but there's nothing else
for you to sell here.

1:02:34.689 --> 1:02:35.624
I'll sell you.

1:02:36.190 --> 1:02:37.626
- What?
- Look, I came here

1:02:37.659 --> 1:02:41.095
because I was answering a call
to a higher existence.

1:02:41.128 --> 1:02:43.797
What are you doing here, Dennis?

1:02:44.965 --> 1:02:47.368
You are an infantile know-it-all

1:02:47.669 --> 1:02:50.170
who can't see two feet in front
of his face.

1:02:52.973 --> 1:02:54.709
You try to do something nice.

1:02:56.243 --> 1:02:58.979
See where it gets you. What a
wonderful wedding.

1:03:08.822 --> 1:03:10.190
It's all right. Don't--

1:03:16.997 --> 1:03:19.166
- Mia, what are you doing?
- Looking for a flashlight.

1:03:19.867 --> 1:03:20.901
Don't be silly.

1:03:22.336 --> 1:03:23.837
- Why do you have to do that?
- Do what?

1:03:24.338 --> 1:03:26.840
Push everyone away when they're
just trying to help.

1:03:28.042 --> 1:03:29.410
You're not going out there!

1:03:30.311 --> 1:03:31.378
Why not?

1:03:31.412 --> 1:03:33.047
Because it's dark and I don't
want you getting hurt.

1:03:33.682 --> 1:03:35.082
Get out of my way, please.

1:03:37.084 --> 1:03:39.853
Dennis, please move. I'm scared.

1:03:40.087 --> 1:03:41.155
Of what?

1:03:41.188 --> 1:03:43.090
That he's going to do something
stupid.

1:03:43.424 --> 1:03:45.593
He's hurt, Dennis. He's very
fragile.

1:03:46.226 --> 1:03:47.261
Fragile?

1:03:48.028 --> 1:03:49.564
He's probably just clearing his
head.

1:03:50.732 --> 1:03:52.534
You don't even know who you're
trying to protect!

1:03:52.933 --> 1:03:56.236
He has been absolutely kind to
me from the start and that's all
I need to know.

1:03:56.538 --> 1:03:58.272
I don't care about his past.

1:03:59.273 --> 1:04:00.775
You're not going out there.

1:04:14.221 --> 1:04:15.289
Roger!

1:04:27.301 --> 1:04:28.302
Roger!

1:04:51.458 --> 1:04:52.326
Where is he?

1:04:53.427 --> 1:04:54.763
What are you talking about?

1:04:55.496 --> 1:04:56.598
I just saw him!

1:04:57.866 --> 1:04:58.833
Why are you crying?

1:04:58.867 --> 1:04:59.768
What did he do to you?

1:05:02.469 --> 1:05:03.505
Why do you have this?

1:05:04.539 --> 1:05:05.607
I, uh ...

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:08.676
I watched you get rid of
everything in the apartment.

1:05:09.476 --> 1:05:10.978
When did you get this?

1:05:11.613 --> 1:05:12.279
Baby ...

1:05:12.847 --> 1:05:13.782
I can explain.

1:05:14.148 --> 1:05:15.115
I just found that in my--

1:05:15.149 --> 1:05:15.817
Stop!

1:05:16.518 --> 1:05:18.853
Stop lying!

1:05:20.187 --> 1:05:23.123
How are we supposed to have a
family when you're like this?

1:05:28.797 --> 1:05:31.498
I think we should take some time
apart while you shoot the movie.

1:05:36.838 --> 1:05:37.938
What?

1:05:44.712 --> 1:05:46.380
There's no movie, Mia.

1:05:48.048 --> 1:05:48.750
There's nothing.

1:05:51.686 --> 1:05:52.620
See?

1:05:54.221 --> 1:05:56.858
All you do is lie.

1:06:00.562 --> 1:06:01.161
Mia.

1:06:01.195 --> 1:06:02.262
Don't follow me.

1:06:41.301 --> 1:06:42.202
Mia?

1:06:48.810 --> 1:06:49.711
Mia?

1:06:58.786 --> 1:06:59.921
Mia, open the door.

1:07:02.957 --> 1:07:04.258
Mia, open the door!

1:07:06.594 --> 1:07:07.729
Open the door!

1:07:11.231 --> 1:07:12.000
What are you doing?

1:07:12.499 --> 1:07:13.902
What are you doing?

1:07:14.134 --> 1:07:15.235
I wanted to feel it.

1:07:46.034 --> 1:07:47.134
Hey.

1:07:50.004 --> 1:07:51.204
Hey, hey, hey.

1:07:54.141 --> 1:07:55.175
You need to wake up.

1:07:57.277 --> 1:07:58.478
I don't feel good.

1:08:00.882 --> 1:08:02.016
I don't like it.

1:08:02.316 --> 1:08:02.984
I know.

1:08:03.618 --> 1:08:04.953
You're gonna be okay.

1:08:06.219 --> 1:08:07.055
All right. I'm gonna ...

1:08:07.789 --> 1:08:09.289
call for a car in the morning....

1:08:09.791 --> 1:08:11.059
and get us back to the city.

1:08:12.159 --> 1:08:13.962
Put your arms around me. Come
here.

1:08:15.228 --> 1:08:16.196
It's okay.

1:08:25.138 --> 1:08:26.074
Drink this.

1:08:40.487 --> 1:08:42.255
I'm a good person.

1:08:43.091 --> 1:08:44.092
Yes, you are.

1:08:47.361 --> 1:08:48.997
You're a liar.

1:08:53.768 --> 1:08:54.736
I know.

1:09:27.467 --> 1:09:28.069
What?

1:10:36.336 --> 1:10:37.237
How you feelin--

1:10:40.608 --> 1:10:41.441
What are you doing?

1:10:46.681 --> 1:10:48.149
Where are you going?

1:10:48.182 --> 1:10:51.351
I'm going to "clear my head."
Call me when the car's here.

1:11:08.401 --> 1:11:09.203
Hey.

1:11:10.303 --> 1:11:11.139
Jesus.

1:11:11.572 --> 1:11:12.807
Roger, you scared me.

1:11:20.214 --> 1:11:21.816
Can I talk to you about
something?

1:11:29.023 --> 1:11:31.092
Dennis isn't the right one for
you.

1:11:31.726 --> 1:11:33.194
He doesn't appreciate you.

1:11:34.762 --> 1:11:36.664
You can't trust somebody like
that.

1:11:37.098 --> 1:11:39.033
Yeah. It's Dennis Lotz, is he
in?

1:11:40.268 --> 1:11:41.334
Okay, thanks.

1:11:41.769 --> 1:11:43.237
I know how you feel about it.

1:11:44.672 --> 1:11:46.073
I can see it in your eyes.

1:11:47.241 --> 1:11:49.043
He's in a meeting? Really?

1:11:49.877 --> 1:11:51.512
Don't play possum with me.

1:11:53.114 --> 1:11:54.682
Oh you can give him a message?

1:11:54.949 --> 1:11:56.250
Okay, give him this message:

1:11:56.284 --> 1:11:57.685
You're fucking fired!

1:12:00.555 --> 1:12:02.422
It's about that time someone ...

1:12:04.025 --> 1:12:05.259
lived for you.

1:12:14.367 --> 1:12:16.103
The properties change when you
boil 'em.

1:12:17.939 --> 1:12:21.542
It's normal to enter a state of
psychosis when going through
withdrawals.

1:12:24.477 --> 1:12:25.713
Beautiful family, brother.

1:12:40.127 --> 1:12:40.795
Mia!

1:12:43.164 --> 1:12:43.831
Mia!

1:12:46.801 --> 1:12:47.467
Mia!

1:12:53.107 --> 1:12:53.774
Mia!

1:13:00.982 --> 1:13:02.016
Mia!

1:13:03.517 --> 1:13:04.552
Mia!

1:14:41.349 --> 1:14:42.216
He's back!

1:14:43.617 --> 1:14:46.354
Look who's back!

1:15:00.434 --> 1:15:01.802
Hmm. Okay.

1:15:02.603 --> 1:15:03.738
Oh, I love this song!

1:15:04.405 --> 1:15:07.274
This could be our song!

1:15:14.482 --> 1:15:16.250
You had a nervous break,
brother.

1:15:17.752 --> 1:15:21.489
I hear it happens to lots of
actors.

1:15:22.923 --> 1:15:23.791
It's all right.

1:15:25.926 --> 1:15:27.628
It's gonna be ...

1:15:28.129 --> 1:15:28.896
easy.

1:15:32.900 --> 1:15:34.101
Would you look at that girl.

1:15:35.903 --> 1:15:37.171
Look at that beautiful girl.

1:15:38.139 --> 1:15:39.140
You had it all.

1:15:40.274 --> 1:15:41.609
But you just kept ...

1:15:42.410 --> 1:15:44.145
shoving junk ...

1:15:45.079 --> 1:15:46.247
up your arm ...

1:15:47.748 --> 1:15:49.383
up your nose ...

1:15:50.785 --> 1:15:51.952
up any ...

1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:55.289
hole you could find.

1:16:00.795 --> 1:16:04.165
You think anybody's gonna ...

1:16:04.765 --> 1:16:06.967
wonder what happened when they
find you?

1:16:07.001 --> 1:16:09.270
Pancake, run!

1:16:13.607 --> 1:16:14.308
Yeah.

1:16:14.341 --> 1:16:15.376
I doubt it too.

1:16:16.677 --> 1:16:18.012
What's the matter, need a hand?

1:16:42.803 --> 1:16:44.071
I love you.

1:16:45.906 --> 1:16:46.707
I ...

1:16:48.642 --> 1:16:50.077
love you.

1:16:51.212 --> 1:16:53.347
She doesn't know who you are
right now.

1:16:53.582 --> 1:16:55.483
She ate a lot of berries.

1:17:04.191 --> 1:17:05.926
It was great seeing you,
brother.

1:17:08.863 --> 1:17:09.663
To ...

1:17:11.499 --> 1:17:12.266
the ...

1:17:15.402 --> 1:17:16.571
moon.

1:17:18.573 --> 1:17:20.407
To the moon.

1:19:22.830 --> 1:19:24.098
Where is he?

1:19:24.131 --> 1:19:25.634
Who?

1:19:25.667 --> 1:19:26.500
My brother.

1:19:26.534 --> 1:19:27.201
Your brother?

1:19:28.369 --> 1:19:29.970
- What are you talking about?
- He tried to kill me.

1:19:30.572 --> 1:19:31.606
And you.

1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:33.575
Baby, you're just having a
nightmare.

1:19:34.174 --> 1:19:36.844
It's okay. Me and Pan are right
here.

1:19:38.345 --> 1:19:39.514
It's okay.

1:19:39.547 --> 1:19:41.215
You're going through
withdrawals.

1:19:41.650 --> 1:19:44.151
We've been through this before,
you're gonna be fine.

1:19:46.420 --> 1:19:47.421
I'm so hot.

1:19:48.255 --> 1:19:50.824
I'm right here. I'm gonna take
care of you.

1:19:53.394 --> 1:19:55.195
This is the last time, Mia.

1:19:56.665 --> 1:19:57.331
I swear.

1:19:58.032 --> 1:19:58.866
I know.

1:20:00.401 --> 1:20:01.168
I love you.

1:20:02.202 --> 1:20:03.037
To the moon.

1:20:05.072 --> 1:20:06.940
Let me get you something to
drink, okay?
