01:16.160 --> 01:19.118
Today is a great day for the Bundys.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.838
Daddy paid the water bill.
How do you do it, Al?

01:24.040 --> 01:29.034
As overseer of the vast Bundy fortune,
I came up with a bold financial plan.

01:29.240 --> 01:31.310
I sold my blood.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.033
All right. It is time to cut
the ceremonial ribbon.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.037
Peg, as someone who's been...

01:44.240 --> 01:46.879
...symbolically cutting
things off for years...

01:47.080 --> 01:49.116
...will you do the honours?

01:49.320 --> 01:52.471
I declare this the Al Bundy faucet...

01:52.680 --> 01:58.596
...which, like its namesake, has been
dry lo these many months, open.

02:07.040 --> 02:09.270
Okay, here we go.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.756
It's the water! It's the water!

02:15.960 --> 02:19.509
Oh, Al, it's so brown on the first day.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.280
And crunchy too.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.318
Now, don't waste any of this stuff.

02:24.520 --> 02:30.072
This crunchy stuff is life-giving
vitamins, minerals and asbestos.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.273
All right, who wants Bundy iced tea?

02:33.480 --> 02:35.232
I do! I do!

02:35.440 --> 02:37.829
Okay, here we go.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.473
Oh, boy.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.878
It's like Christmas, our birthdays
and the Fourth of July all in one.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.354
Toast.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.913
To Dad's blood.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.588
And the poor sap who got it.

03:01.760 --> 03:04.149
Well, it's brown, just like I like it.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.954
I think I broke my tooth.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.595
- There you go.
- God is good to us.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.030
Yes, he is.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.876
Must have been a washer.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.520
- Lucky duck.
- Yeah, lucky indeed.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.598
I got lumpy water
and you're the family that loves me.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.234
Who could ask for anything more?

03:34.440 --> 03:36.431
I could.

03:36.640 --> 03:41.668
And I believe it's time for one of you
ingrown toenails to get a job.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.677
So can I have a volunteer?

03:45.240 --> 03:47.515
No one? Gee, really?

03:47.720 --> 03:50.234
Wait a second. Something's missing.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.159
Pretend I have money.
Everyone put their hands out.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.390
Yep, there's a hand missing.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.676
I'm late.

04:06.480 --> 04:10.439
Congratulations, pumpkin.
You just volunteered.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.551
Come on, kid. This could get ugly.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.069
We're going to the park
to pick up some chicks.

04:15.280 --> 04:18.954
You know the routine. Find a girl,
tell her I saved your life in Nam...

04:19.160 --> 04:22.072
...and I no longer have
any feelings left in my hands.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.114
The only thing that could bring it back
is the touch of a beautiful woman.

04:26.320 --> 04:31.348
That's "woman. " Let's not have any
stupid mistakes like last week, okay?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.679
Hey, I'm 6.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.189
- You should know better.
- So should you.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.518
He was carrying a cat and singing
show tunes, for God's sakes.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.788
Al, don't do this to my baby.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.476
Oh, my God.
He's gonna ask me to get a job.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.479
Don't do this, Al.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.955
Throughout history,
Wanker women have done nothing.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.752
And we're proud of it.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.953
Why, we sat on pioneer couches
at the backs of wagon trains.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.230
We slept late during Indian attacks...

05:02.440 --> 05:06.558
...and had our hair done while
our husbands had theirs scalped.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.713
You know, the West is speckled
with graveyards...

05:09.920 --> 05:13.037
...filled with the bodies of men
who died before their time...

05:13.240 --> 05:15.231
...supporting Wanker women.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.477
Don't break the chain, Al.
Don't break the chain.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.233
Pumpkin, I have something
that I have to tell you.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.233
Oh, my God,
he is gonna ask me to get a job.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.640
- It's okay, it's okay. Come on, sit down.
- Yes, yes, yes.

05:28.840 --> 05:33.595
There, there, there,
my little leech, there, there.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.397
Now, honey, let me explain this
to you by telling you...

05:37.600 --> 05:40.398
...about the plough horse
that had to pull the heavy wagon.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.156
- What was the horsey's name, Daddy?
- Al.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.959
The horsey in your story
has your name, Daddy.

05:48.160 --> 05:50.833
Yes, he did, pumpkin.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.350
Anyway, he pulled and he pulled.

05:54.560 --> 05:59.793
And then on the road,
a big red cow jumped onto the cart.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.595
Wouldn't it be funny
if the cow's name was Peggy?

06:07.520 --> 06:12.355
And before he knew it, little horsey
after little horsey jumped on the cart...

06:12.560 --> 06:17.714
...until poor Al collapsed in a heap
and died a horrible, twitching death.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.108
That was a good story, Daddy.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.832
Indeed.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.998
But, honey, the story doesn't
have to end that way.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.997
If a little horsey would help out...

06:29.200 --> 06:31.509
...maybe the Al horse
could save a few bucks...

06:31.720 --> 06:35.156
...and then go
to the nudie horsey bar.

06:38.320 --> 06:43.758
So in fact, your little story
is just a thinly veiled allegory...

06:43.960 --> 06:46.633
...a Metamucil, if you will...

06:47.360 --> 06:50.955
...to convince me by imagery
to get a job.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.074
How coincidental
that it should come now...

06:54.280 --> 06:57.716
...while I have been so busy thinking
about the emptiness of my existence.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.956
I know I must have
a greater purpose.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.798
Maybe I should get a job.

07:04.760 --> 07:08.355
Now, now, red cow.

07:09.840 --> 07:14.197
Sweetheart, all I can tell you is
you're gonna love work.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.038
I do.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.150
I really don't.

07:28.440 --> 07:33.195
So you think you got what it takes
to be a burger waitress?

07:35.040 --> 07:37.349
Let's see your application.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.152
It's blank.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.716
Well, you got what it takes
to be a burger waitress.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.154
So is there any training
that I have to do?

07:50.360 --> 07:54.433
Well, let's see.
Do you know what a plate looks like?

07:57.160 --> 07:59.435
Excellent!

07:59.640 --> 08:01.631
Do you know
what a table looks like?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.758
Excellent!

08:06.960 --> 08:10.350
Now, you take one to the other.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.755
Do you know which one?

08:15.840 --> 08:19.753
Well, the table would be too heavy
to take to the plate.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.869
Ergo, as Shakespeare said,
the plate's the thing.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.429
You are a find.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.996
Feel good about yourself, missy.
You have chosen a profession...

08:31.200 --> 08:34.953
...in which many great Americans
have rotted away their youth.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.515
Now, smile.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.996
- What was that for?
- That's a " before" picture.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.719
- What is " harginher"?
- That's hamburger.

10:35.920 --> 10:40.072
The H is silent, you illiteral.

10:42.160 --> 10:44.913
Well, I assume "flies" means fries.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.671
Now, what is this?
"Two balls and a chick quacker"?

10:50.320 --> 10:52.880
That's two bowls of chicken soup...

10:53.240 --> 10:55.071
...and quackers.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.436
Well, " ugg" on my face, eh?

10:58.600 --> 11:00.830
Well, listen...

11:01.040 --> 11:04.999
...I just want to tell you, you're the
stupidest girl I've had working here.

11:05.200 --> 11:08.909
And that says a lot,
that says an awful lot.

11:09.120 --> 11:12.908
In fact,
you are one whopping moron.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.310
So you wanna go out with me later?

11:18.520 --> 11:21.114
I would rather stick my nose
in the deep fryer.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.630
That is, if there's enough room for it
with the mouse in there.

11:25.040 --> 11:29.318
Hey, I worked an hour
to get half of that out of there.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.272
Besides, the people seem to like it.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.756
We call them Cajun fries.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.633
We're almost out.
Could you set a couple of traps?

11:37.840 --> 11:40.195
And set them on "stun,"
they stay fresher.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.352
There she is! There's my little girl.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.074
The first Bundy woman
to have ever worked.

11:48.320 --> 11:53.758
Jefferson, get a picture of me
and my little girl in her place of work.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.389
Okay. Say " ptomaine. "

11:57.960 --> 12:00.997
Hey, didn't you take my picture once
when I was on a cruise?

12:01.200 --> 12:03.873
I think I was
with Florence Henderson.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.272
<i>You think if I was that good-looking
guy from The Love Boat...</i>

12:08.480 --> 12:10.675
...I'd be doing this?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.677
No, I'd be rich.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.394
Another picture, captain?

12:15.600 --> 12:18.353
I mean, Fonzie? Al.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.718
Yes, yes, one right over here.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.639
Oh, look at this.
This is my baby's first tip.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.990
Get a picture of this.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.270
Now get a picture of this.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.388
Pumpkin, I want you to know that
this is the proudest day of my life...

12:36.600 --> 12:39.239
...and will remain so until the day
your mother leaves me.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.910
Let's go, Jefferson. I'll bet you can't
wait until your firstborn gets a job.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.111
Well, by the time
my first kid is born...

12:46.320 --> 12:49.232
...I'll have already been gone
eight months.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.915
Children, this is the last stop for
our school program "Scared Smart"...

12:58.120 --> 13:02.033
...in which we learn that being cool
in high school does not mean success.

13:02.720 --> 13:06.156
To demonstrate, I give you
the former queen of our high school.

13:06.360 --> 13:10.194
She was so pretty and so popular...

13:10.400 --> 13:14.871
...and she dated all the male teachers
and my husband...

13:15.080 --> 13:20.950
...and my boyfriend, who was only 16,
but God, did he earn that A.

13:21.680 --> 13:25.309
Anyway, she learned nothing
in five years of high school...

13:25.520 --> 13:27.954
...and you worshipped her for it.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.991
You used to know her
as Kelly Bundy...

13:30.200 --> 13:34.876
...but now she answers to the name
she'll carry for the rest of her life.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.274
Hey, waitress!

13:40.600 --> 13:42.477
- It is Kelly Bundy!
- Oh, my God.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.194
I've got to get to the library!

13:45.440 --> 13:49.115
Well, Ms. Bundy,
now that you're a waitress...

13:49.320 --> 13:52.756
<i>...I'd like to give you a tip:
Stay away from my new husband.</i>

13:52.960 --> 13:56.635
He's 18 and still peaking.

13:58.080 --> 14:01.550
Well, he'd have to peek.
He wouldn't want to look at it dead on.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.479
- I'm hungry!
- You know the rules.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.716
Never eat
until your sister gets home.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.070
Now we eat!

14:17.840 --> 14:20.354
Man, look at the grease on this bag.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.313
Always the sign of a fine restaurant.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.359
Come on there, get in there.

14:27.640 --> 14:32.077
Oh, man. Look how much some guy
left over from his hamburger.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.516
The sap.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.310
- Dad, want some mashed potatoes?
- Yes, I would.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.829
Well, we'll get rid of that.

14:44.880 --> 14:48.270
Buck, will you bring me
my fuzzy slippers?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.588
Thanks, boy.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.076
Hey, I'm sorry.
I didn't bring you anything.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.552
God, I did him a favour.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.991
The only thing worse
than serving the food is eating it.

15:15.240 --> 15:16.912
Well, these fries are delicious.

15:17.120 --> 15:21.079
Look, this one's curly
like a mouse's tail.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.235
I want my mommy. Where is she?

15:29.840 --> 15:32.877
Well, your mother's
kind of sad about something.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.479
I don't know what it's about.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.240
I didn't ask her
because then she'd tell me.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.033
Say hello to your daughter.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.633
I don't have a daughter.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.593
If I had a daughter,
she would never work.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.791
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.151
Nobody knows the sorrow.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.189
Hey, food!

16:02.800 --> 16:05.519
Daddy, I'm thinking
of quitting my job.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.436
Pumpkin, no!

16:12.200 --> 16:13.792
You can't quit your job.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.878
And I say that not because
I'm giddy with nutrients...

16:17.080 --> 16:19.310
...and starting to get feeling
in my right foot.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.834
It goes deeper than that.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.833
- Well, then why?
- For one reason, pumpkin.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.634
Because Bundys are losers,
not quitters.

16:27.440 --> 16:32.434
And I like to think that I recognize
a little bit of loser in you.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.279
Oh, Daddy.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.958
So that's it then, I'm a waitress.

16:39.160 --> 16:40.673
Oh, God.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.518
So pumpkin...

16:42.720 --> 16:45.518
...you thought you were meant
for something more, didn't you?

16:45.720 --> 16:48.188
- Yes.
- Me too.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.677
But we weren't.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.872
Hey, Bundy, wanna go
to a movie with me later?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.071
Maybe. What's playing?

17:10.319 --> 17:12.880
<i>Hot Buttered Me.</i>

17:15.480 --> 17:17.277
That's a good one.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.234
Oh, my God. What am I saying?

17:22.440 --> 17:24.635
What did I almost just do?

17:24.839 --> 17:28.230
What have I become?
What is to become of me?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.192
What am I sitting in?

17:30.400 --> 17:33.631
What is the meaning of life?
What is being and nothingness?

17:33.840 --> 17:35.273
Why is everyone staring at me?

17:36.760 --> 17:40.469
Oh, that's right. Because when
I talk like this, people can hear me.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.915
When I talk like...

17:46.120 --> 17:47.519
<i>...I'm talking now...</i>

17:47.720 --> 17:50.234
...people don't hear me.
I have to remember that.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.798
Hi, honey.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.754
I came to tell you that I have forgiven
you for the terrible thing you've done.

17:58.000 --> 18:02.551
- You mean working?
- Now, we don't have to say that word.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.239
Save that kind of bad language...

18:04.440 --> 18:07.273
...for when you're hanging around
street corners with the boys.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.153
It's enough to say,
"A mother forgives. "

18:11.760 --> 18:13.910
Oh, great hair.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.515
No, no, no, honey,
what you're doing now is thinking.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.838
When thinking makes sounds
in your throat, then you're talking.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.632
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.189
You weren't supposed to,
I was thinking.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.352
Oh, you have really grown up.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.277
Excuse me, aren't you Kelly Bundy?

18:43.520 --> 18:46.114
Actually, I'm her younger sister.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.796
Wow, you must have had a wild life.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.032
Not lately.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.675
I'm Kelly Bundy.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.917
Wow, you must have had a wild life.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.315
Well, not lately.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.956
- So, what can I do for you?
- Well, you were always my idol.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.513
I thought you might help me.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.154
I've been grounded
and I've got this party to go to...

19:10.360 --> 19:13.113
...and every kid in town with a tattoo
is gonna be there.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.557
- The Rodriguez affair.
- Yeah.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.429
But I can't go, and if I don't,
I'll be socially dead.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.119
You must go.

19:22.320 --> 19:27.678
Mom, she's grounded. And it is wrong
to openly defy your parents.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.310
You're gonna have to sneak out.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.759
But what if they check my room?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.510
Well, before you sneak out,
tell your mother...

19:35.720 --> 19:38.393
...she's looking like your father,
then tell your father...

19:38.600 --> 19:41.956
...it's that time of the month, you've
got cramps and you wanna talk.

19:42.160 --> 19:46.597
No one's gonna check your room,
talk to you or look at you for days.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.709
Oh, wow, you're a genius.
How do you know all this?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.633
How does the turkey
know how to fly?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.870
He just knows.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.353
I am so proud of you.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.755
- Why?
- Well, two reasons.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.598
First of all, during all this...

20:06.800 --> 20:11.555
...these people have been starving
for food and you've just ignored them.

20:11.760 --> 20:15.514
I think I see
a little bit of Peggy in you.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.036
Second thing, honey, is I think
you have finally found your calling.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.038
Why, this diner
is like a husband to you.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.958
It gives you shelter and money...

20:24.160 --> 20:27.914
...and you don't have to do anything
to earn either.

20:29.320 --> 20:33.279
So this just might be the answer
to my quest for the holy pail.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.791
My purpose is to pass on
my experience and knowledge...

20:38.000 --> 20:39.274
...to the young.

20:39.480 --> 20:42.597
Serving a burger
with a side of wisdom, if you will.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.792
It's nice to know that despite
the fact that you've got parents...

20:46.000 --> 20:48.230
...and teachers and brothers
and sisters...

20:48.440 --> 20:51.477
...friends and guidance counsellors,
policemen and priests...

20:51.680 --> 20:55.878
...that there is somebody that
you can go to when you need help.

20:56.080 --> 21:00.517
And that someone is Kelly Bundy,
philosopher waitress.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.038
Hey, where's my food?

21:08.240 --> 21:10.549
Drop dead.

21:10.760 --> 21:12.751
And stay in school.

21:14.960 --> 21:17.315
Okay, I'm gonna answer
your questions in order.

21:17.520 --> 21:20.034
Sandy, always bring a toothbrush...

21:20.240 --> 21:24.313
...because you can cheat on your
boyfriend, but not on your gums.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.035
Miss Parker, if you insist
on going out with 18-year-olds...

21:28.240 --> 21:31.437
...have enough sense
to bring along your own protection.

21:31.640 --> 21:34.108
Safety is everyone's responsibility.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.157
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.669
Good luck, girls.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.272
Here you go, sir.
