NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:34.088 --> 00:39.088
<i>Now let me tell you the tale</i>
<i>Of a team who played volleyball</i>

00:39.505 --> 00:43.963
<i>A sport a bit like tennis</i>
<i>But the rackets are your hands</i>

00:44.213 --> 00:48.713
<i>The players on this team</i>
<i>Were all kind of hot</i>

00:49.172 --> 00:53.005
<i>Another thing they have in common</i>
<i>Is that they die before the end</i>

00:53.130 --> 00:57.338
<i>Oh, the Falcons, the Falcons</i>

00:57.713 --> 01:04.297
<i>Oh, the Falcons, the Falcons</i>
<i>Oh, the Falcons</i>

01:04.755 --> 01:06.588
<i>Listen to this...</i>

01:11.088 --> 01:12.213
Come on!

01:13.963 --> 01:15.047
Crush those bitches!

01:20.422 --> 01:22.755
Come on, girls! Let's win this cup!

01:22.838 --> 01:24.297
Go, Falcons!

01:30.172 --> 01:32.255
Go, Falcons! Go, Falcons!

01:32.338 --> 01:34.338
We need to change our strategy,
flip 6-3-0.

01:34.672 --> 01:37.963
Morgane, you go into defense.
Jeanne, to the net and hit them hard!

01:38.047 --> 01:40.547
-Wait, what the fuck?
-Shut up! Do as I say. OK?

01:44.422 --> 01:45.297
OK, Jeanne?

01:45.422 --> 01:48.130
-Uh, yeah, sure, I'll try.
-No, buddy, don't try. Do it!

01:48.338 --> 01:49.797
-OK.
-Kick their asses!

01:49.880 --> 01:50.713
OK.

01:50.963 --> 01:53.922
Tatiana, Dany, now's the time. OK?
Give it your all!

01:54.005 --> 01:54.838
You, M.A...

01:54.922 --> 01:58.130
I know, Hazuki, I wasn't great.
But, I swear, I'll give it everything!

01:58.422 --> 01:59.922
OK, you do that.

02:04.422 --> 02:05.630
Is that your boyfriend?

02:06.338 --> 02:08.713
Oh, hon, I had no idea. I'm sorry...

02:09.338 --> 02:11.963
Because I gave him a quick hand-job
behind the gym earlier.

02:12.047 --> 02:14.297
So, the whore's name
tattooed on his leg is yours!

02:14.672 --> 02:18.422
OK, now I get it. I wasn't sure
if it was his mom's or his chick's.

02:20.422 --> 02:21.255
Thanks!

02:21.630 --> 02:24.755
-Momo, I thought we said we'd play fair.
-She's the one asking for it.

02:49.047 --> 02:50.505
Got it! Wait, no, no, I don't...

02:52.547 --> 02:53.630
Nice one, M.A.!

02:57.255 --> 02:58.213
This point is ours!

03:07.255 --> 03:08.213
Yes!

03:11.630 --> 03:13.797
Now I'm bleeding, and it hurts!

03:15.755 --> 03:18.880
Sorry, my little Jeannette.
I just had to do it. No hard feelings...

03:18.963 --> 03:21.130
What were you thinking?
You could've hurt her!

03:21.213 --> 03:22.755
-I'm...
-You could have hurt them.

03:22.838 --> 03:25.047
I'm sorry, I know,
I should've stuck to the plan.

03:25.130 --> 03:26.172
Yeah, you should have!

03:26.255 --> 03:28.422
But, come on. We fucking won, didn't we?

03:28.713 --> 03:31.463
We're the champions! Come on, girls!

03:33.463 --> 03:35.255
-You were great, sweetie.
-Thanks. Stop!

03:35.338 --> 03:36.547
-What?
-No. Not here!

03:37.630 --> 03:40.130
Hey, hey, hey! Is this new?

03:40.380 --> 03:43.130
-As a champion, you're even hotter!
-Stop! It's embarrassing.

03:43.213 --> 03:45.172
-I really want you!
-I know, I can see that!

03:45.838 --> 03:48.047
Why am I always
the last one to know everything?

03:49.963 --> 03:50.797
Serge...

03:51.005 --> 03:53.338
Sorry, it's my job.
I have to go. I'll call you.

03:53.922 --> 03:54.922
Hope you're OK, Jenny!

04:03.047 --> 04:04.880
-Who was that?
-I don't know.

04:08.172 --> 04:10.005
Hey, girls, time to go. I smell trouble.

04:10.088 --> 04:11.130
-Jeanne...
-Yeah?

04:11.505 --> 04:12.463
We need to go.

04:12.588 --> 04:13.755
-Huh?
-We need to go.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.755
Say bye, girls. Say bye!

04:20.713 --> 04:21.547
<i>Gracias, </i>ma'am!

04:23.588 --> 04:24.422
Girls!

04:53.922 --> 04:55.797
<i>Oh, oh, oh... Pam, Pam, Padam</i>

04:56.005 --> 04:58.672
<i>Pam, Pam, Padam</i>
<i>Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam</i>

05:17.172 --> 05:19.380
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

06:14.505 --> 06:19.213
<i>It's called "Girls With Balls"</i>
<i>Because they've got bigger balls than you</i>

06:19.297 --> 06:23.547
<i>Turn off your cell, you bastard</i>
<i>This is a movie theater</i>

06:23.630 --> 06:25.963
<i>The show's about to begin</i>

06:26.047 --> 06:28.088
<i>The girls are going to get done in</i>

06:28.380 --> 06:30.797
<i>In a match without a prize</i>

06:30.880 --> 06:33.047
<i>Almost everybody dies</i>

06:33.130 --> 06:36.630
<i>Oh, the Falcons, Falcons</i>

06:36.880 --> 06:39.005
<i>The Falcons...</i>

06:45.213 --> 06:46.213
Holy shit!

06:47.338 --> 06:49.797
-It exploded.
-That's not very safe. Seriously.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.172
-Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.
-Easy, Coach.

06:52.255 --> 06:53.630
This road's full of animals!

06:54.172 --> 06:56.255
Hello? Can you hear me?

06:56.380 --> 06:58.963
No, it's because I hardly get
any signal out here.

06:59.255 --> 07:00.297
What? Ah.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.672
Yeah, me too. I love you, too.

07:05.088 --> 07:06.047
Hello? Hello?

07:06.547 --> 07:07.755
Hello? Hello?

07:08.838 --> 07:10.047
Damn it!

07:10.505 --> 07:12.963
Jenny and Serge took the train.
We'll see them tonight.

07:14.463 --> 07:15.713
This RV sucks...

07:16.047 --> 07:18.380
What's it like
now that you and Serge are official?

07:18.630 --> 07:19.963
Are you going to make babies?

07:21.838 --> 07:23.213
Oh, come on. Please!

07:23.547 --> 07:24.713
That made me sick.

07:25.088 --> 07:26.338
Don't be jealous, Morgane.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.880
Me? Jealous?
She doesn't have anything I don't have.

07:30.963 --> 07:33.630
Is that right?
You're playing in the Nationals, too?

07:34.255 --> 07:35.130
She needs to know.

07:35.213 --> 07:38.463
The guy in the suit at the game,
he was a scout for the Nationals!

07:38.963 --> 07:41.088
He talked to Jeanne
and it went really well.

07:41.380 --> 07:44.005
-What the hell are you on about?
-He just gave me his card.

07:44.088 --> 07:46.713
I have to call him. It's not set in stone.

07:48.463 --> 07:51.130
Don't laugh! It's your fault.
If you could pass the ball,

07:51.213 --> 07:55.422
-people would see I'm the best spiker.
-It's not my fault Jenny got injured.

07:55.630 --> 07:58.922
Anyway, maybe he's more interested
in team spirit.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.005
Watch out!

08:02.463 --> 08:03.797
-Fucking hell, Coach!
-Fuck!

08:03.880 --> 08:05.505
Bad news - the water's not working.

08:05.588 --> 08:08.255
I tried to fix it,
but the whole thing is busted.

08:08.713 --> 08:10.797
-No way!
-It stinks in here. Everything stinks.

08:11.338 --> 08:14.880
No water, no shower.
I'm sick of this shit! For fuck's sakes...

08:15.172 --> 08:16.422
Come here, you!

08:19.005 --> 08:22.088
Hey, if you're feeling dirty,
I'd be happy to lick you clean.

08:22.213 --> 08:25.672
Stop! Don't touch me with your tongue!
At least wash your mouth out first!

08:26.297 --> 08:28.130
Enough! Stop pissing me off! Get off me!

08:28.463 --> 08:30.005
-Shut up!
-It's them!

08:30.088 --> 08:32.172
Can you just shut up? Seriously?

08:32.255 --> 08:35.172
Stop thinking of yourself
and start thinking of the team.

08:35.588 --> 08:37.047
-This is great for Jeanne.
-Yeah.

08:37.130 --> 08:39.047
She deserves it. We should support her.

08:39.963 --> 08:41.297
We're fucking sisters!

08:42.005 --> 08:42.880
Don't I deserve it?

08:47.088 --> 08:48.380
Yeah... Yeah.

08:49.380 --> 08:51.463
-But it's alphabetical order.
-Yeah.

08:51.547 --> 08:53.755
See! "J" for Jeanne, is about here.

08:53.838 --> 08:55.713
You, "M" for Morgane, are here.

08:55.797 --> 08:58.630
First Jeanne, then Morgane.
See? It's all very logical.

08:59.547 --> 09:02.380
Anyway, we're the champions, are we not?
Come on! Go, Falcons!

09:02.505 --> 09:04.547
Yeah, Falcons!

09:04.630 --> 09:06.130
Yeah, Falcons!

09:06.463 --> 09:08.213
Yeah...

09:08.338 --> 09:10.172
Go, Falcons! Yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:49.672 --> 09:51.922
Am I the only one
who finds this disgusting?

10:00.505 --> 10:02.172
What the fuck is that, M.A.?

10:02.255 --> 10:04.963
It looks like the floor of a hair salon.
Look! Like a baby!

10:05.213 --> 10:07.380
No, come on! That is sick!

10:07.463 --> 10:09.338
-Coach, that's gross.
-Calm down.

10:09.422 --> 10:11.880
-Check out my pussy.
-Aw, you have a lovely pussy.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.047
Morgane, don't go too far!

10:14.130 --> 10:15.755
OK! Screw you.

10:16.755 --> 10:18.047
-Stop it!
-Look at that, M.A.

10:19.422 --> 10:20.338
That's what blew.

10:21.213 --> 10:23.005
-All fixed!
-How do you know how to do that?

10:23.088 --> 10:24.547
I did a jungle rally once.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.005
Three weeks surviving
in a hostile environment.

10:28.047 --> 10:29.547
-Going to show me?
-Show you what?

10:29.630 --> 10:30.463
Your pussy!

10:30.547 --> 10:32.422
You're disgusting. Stop it!

10:32.880 --> 10:33.963
That's not funny.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.713
It's fixed, Coach,
but easy on the roadkill.

10:40.547 --> 10:41.588
M.A., come here.

10:42.255 --> 10:43.088
-Coach...
-Yes?

10:43.172 --> 10:44.213
-No.
-No, it's...

10:44.380 --> 10:45.463
-It's just...
-No.

10:46.588 --> 10:47.797
-Hold on.
-Hey, Jeanne!

10:49.297 --> 10:50.880
Hold on, I need to load the gear.

10:53.755 --> 10:54.755
Morgane?

11:25.797 --> 11:27.088
Dammit, Morgane!

11:33.088 --> 11:34.005
Morgane?

11:34.380 --> 11:36.005
Yeah! I'm coming! Give me a second!

11:36.672 --> 11:37.505
I'm coming!

11:37.588 --> 11:40.422
Can't I take a dump in peace?
It's nice, then it's not.

11:41.505 --> 11:43.672
Morgane, move your ass! OK?

11:43.838 --> 11:44.838
Yeah, I'm here.

11:45.213 --> 11:47.338
-I'm here!
-About time!

12:02.963 --> 12:05.172
I have no idea where we are.
There are no road signs.

12:05.380 --> 12:07.630
Seriously, what kind of dumb-ass
steals road signs?

12:08.463 --> 12:09.297
Well...

12:09.713 --> 12:10.588
A collector!

12:11.755 --> 12:13.380
-What?
-You're an idiot.

12:14.005 --> 12:14.880
Hand me that map.

12:16.713 --> 12:19.713
OK. What road were we on? The D312.

12:20.713 --> 12:21.630
That's here.

12:22.172 --> 12:24.713
That's odd. We should've
crossed the highway an hour ago.

12:24.797 --> 12:26.713
Now we're on the D366. Here.

12:26.797 --> 12:28.047
Hey, did you see that?

12:38.463 --> 12:39.422
"Hell-Jeim"?

12:40.713 --> 12:41.630
It's not on the map.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.630
Well, we're not turning back.
That's for sure.

12:45.797 --> 12:47.797
Sorry, girls,
we won't be going home tonight.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.672
-No!
-It is what it is.

12:49.755 --> 12:51.672
We'll find a hotel
and leave in the morning.

12:51.755 --> 12:53.547
It's OK, Jeanne.
You'll get ravaged tomorrow!

12:54.130 --> 12:56.505
It's not my fault,
so there's no point in shouting!

12:57.463 --> 12:59.880
-Nobody's shouting, Coach.
-True.

13:59.755 --> 14:00.672
There's no one here.

14:01.047 --> 14:03.130
Or they all shot themselves
out of depression.

14:03.630 --> 14:06.172
I don't want to sound like a brat,
but it doesn't look very cozy.

14:06.255 --> 14:08.005
-For once, I agree with the brat.
-Hey!

14:14.422 --> 14:15.588
-Morgane?
-Yeah?

14:15.672 --> 14:16.963
I'm watching you.

14:38.755 --> 14:39.588
Stop it.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.630
Over here. Howdy, sir.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.505
These lovely ladies and I
would like a room for the night, please.

15:00.755 --> 15:01.880
FULL

15:01.963 --> 15:03.213
Ah, <i>"completo."</i>

15:03.922 --> 15:06.297
Yes, you're fully booked, I see. It shows.

15:06.380 --> 15:09.172
I can tell it's the busy season.
School vacation, is it?

15:09.797 --> 15:11.422
Right, let's speed things up.

15:13.963 --> 15:16.880
We have to go here.<i></i>Here. Look.

15:17.463 --> 15:19.547
We're here. OK? And we want to go here.

15:26.838 --> 15:27.672
Well...

15:28.213 --> 15:29.047
Thank you.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.838
It's OK. He's being nice.

15:34.922 --> 15:36.088
But that is horrible.

15:37.047 --> 15:39.297
Looks like he's got a problem
with his eyelid, eh?

15:39.380 --> 15:40.213
Disgusting.

15:42.338 --> 15:43.672
Sausages aren't her thing.

15:44.088 --> 15:45.380
And they're not mine either.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.213
I like it.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.172
Stop messing around!

16:43.755 --> 16:44.922
Aw, the cutie.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.463
How are you, darling?
What's wrong, Forrest Gump?

16:47.547 --> 16:49.255
Mommy drop you on your head as a baby?

16:52.130 --> 16:54.047
Touch my woman
and I'll cut off your balls!

16:54.213 --> 16:55.880
-Got it?
-OK, nobody move.

16:55.963 --> 16:57.380
Everyone stay calm, OK?

16:57.463 --> 16:59.713
If anyone moves,
my fist will be up your ass. Got it?

16:59.922 --> 17:02.255
Right up your ass like a dummy
and I'll make you talk.

17:02.338 --> 17:03.713
You won't see my lips moving.

17:03.797 --> 17:06.088
I'll talk, but your lips will be moving.
Got it?

17:06.172 --> 17:07.797
Stay back, Tom Sawyer! I'm a nutcase!

17:08.213 --> 17:09.088
Right, girls?

17:09.588 --> 17:10.422
Girls?

17:10.505 --> 17:11.380
Shit!

17:27.297 --> 17:29.172
Fuck!<i></i>Fucking hillbillies!

17:29.380 --> 17:32.672
They're lucky I don't have my digger,
or I'd have smashed their heads in!

17:33.213 --> 17:34.963
So much for no trouble!

17:36.130 --> 17:37.088
Come on, girls!

17:37.338 --> 17:40.255
-Nobody touches my woman.
-The guy licked my cheek.

17:42.963 --> 17:43.797
Proud of yourself?

17:44.005 --> 17:45.922
-Calm down.
-I'm the captain.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.255
-You follow my orders.
-Oh, I don't know.

17:50.088 --> 17:52.297
Maybe I'm just not cut out
to follow your orders.

17:54.422 --> 17:56.463
Maybe you're just not cut out
for this team.

18:01.255 --> 18:03.255
Or maybe you're not cut out to be captain.

18:03.338 --> 18:04.172
No?

18:07.713 --> 18:09.213
Shut the fuck up now! All of you!

18:09.338 --> 18:12.797
You, you, you! All of you, shut up!
Do you hear yourselves?

18:12.922 --> 18:15.005
We are a family. We're a group, a team!

18:15.505 --> 18:16.422
Right? We're one!

18:16.880 --> 18:19.338
God dammit! Do you know
what we looked like back there?

18:19.422 --> 18:21.672
Shall I say?
We looked like a bunch of bitches.

18:21.755 --> 18:22.588
And I am not a bitch!

18:22.672 --> 18:24.672
You might be a bitch.
I don't know, maybe you are.

18:24.755 --> 18:25.880
Maybe you too.

18:25.963 --> 18:28.422
Who's a bitch here?
Come on, hands up! Who's a bitch?

18:28.963 --> 18:31.880
Fucking hell! I'm not a fucking bitch, OK?
You get it?

18:32.338 --> 18:33.713
You get it? So, answer me!

18:33.880 --> 18:35.713
Question, answer. Do you understand?

18:35.838 --> 18:36.922
-Yes!
-Yes, who?

18:37.005 --> 18:38.047
-Yes, Coach!
-Yes, boss!

18:38.130 --> 18:39.005
Coach!

18:40.213 --> 18:43.713
Now, we're going to calm down
because you're all worked up.

18:43.797 --> 18:44.963
Come on, let's calm down.

18:46.213 --> 18:47.547
You think it's fucking funny!

18:47.630 --> 18:50.088
We'll drive to the next town,
find a hotel to stay in,

18:50.172 --> 18:52.630
and leave first thing tomorrow morning
after a good rest. OK?

18:54.505 --> 18:55.713
Great.

18:56.630 --> 18:57.630
And I forgot to say...

18:57.713 --> 19:00.672
The first one of you
to open your fucking mouth

19:00.755 --> 19:01.588
is out of here.

19:01.672 --> 19:03.463
She will be doing 500 push-ups!

19:03.547 --> 19:06.380
Five hundred! With broken glass
under your knees for all I care!

19:06.463 --> 19:08.588
Shit! I didn't want to get angry!
I didn't, honestly.

19:08.672 --> 19:09.922
But I think I am a bit now.

19:11.297 --> 19:12.130
Thank you.

19:18.672 --> 19:21.047
-Touch my lady again and I'll cut...
-I can hear you!

19:21.172 --> 19:22.588
I'm here. I'm not deaf!

19:26.005 --> 19:27.880
I'll cut off your balls...

19:38.838 --> 19:40.838
Turns out knowing how to hunt
comes in handy.

19:41.588 --> 19:42.922
-Everyone eaten enough?
-Yeah.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.130
Last time I was this full was when
I chanced upon a boys' locker room!

19:46.213 --> 19:47.672
-Ew! You're disgusting!
-Gross.

19:51.338 --> 19:52.297
No dessert?

19:52.380 --> 19:54.547
I'm so hungry I could eat anything!

19:55.005 --> 19:56.963
Really? You're hungry? Weird.

19:57.047 --> 19:57.922
Give her a break!

19:58.005 --> 19:59.505
I've got nothing against fatsos!

19:59.588 --> 20:01.422
She's the one who complains
she can't jump.

20:01.630 --> 20:03.755
-Right, chubs?
-I could easily be a spiker.

20:03.838 --> 20:05.797
Come on, give us a break!

20:06.213 --> 20:08.213
You're about as likely to get a boyfriend!

20:08.297 --> 20:09.380
No chance of either!

20:09.463 --> 20:11.630
At the same time,
look on the bright side, it...

20:11.838 --> 20:14.088
It means at least something about you
is balanced!

20:16.422 --> 20:17.630
Morgane, too far!

20:17.755 --> 20:19.505
Oh, come on, I'm only having a laugh.

20:19.755 --> 20:21.755
Without a sense of humor,
there's not much left.

20:23.088 --> 20:24.088
What?

20:25.297 --> 20:26.380
I hate her!

20:27.422 --> 20:29.672
She's always putting me down,
no matter what I do!

20:29.755 --> 20:31.547
Morgane is just a bitch.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.338
We know that. She can't help it.

20:34.672 --> 20:37.338
You're better than her.
You're smarter than her.

20:37.505 --> 20:39.213
No, seriously, no!

20:39.672 --> 20:42.338
I'm sick of being the one
who always puts in the work,

20:42.422 --> 20:44.047
the one who always takes the blame.

20:44.213 --> 20:45.130
That's enough!

20:45.963 --> 20:49.422
I'm done! No more Miss Nice M.A.!

20:52.213 --> 20:54.672
Want to tell me what you're thinking
or is it a secret?

20:58.047 --> 20:59.838
I managed to call the Nationals scout.

21:02.588 --> 21:03.713
And he told me that...

21:05.005 --> 21:08.588
with a few more months of training,
I could be in the Nationals.

21:08.672 --> 21:09.505
Yes!

21:09.588 --> 21:11.297
-Yeah!
-Go you!

21:11.755 --> 21:14.380
Yeah, but he wants an answer in two days.

21:14.463 --> 21:15.630
So, if I accept...

21:16.922 --> 21:18.172
I have to leave the team.

21:21.547 --> 21:23.213
Don't worry, you won't be gone long.

21:24.338 --> 21:25.172
What?

21:26.755 --> 21:27.755
What will they need?

21:28.505 --> 21:31.130
Five minutes to realize
that you're not Nationals material?

21:31.755 --> 21:34.297
-You don't have it in you, darling...
-And you do?

21:35.713 --> 21:37.255
Oh, there she is!

21:37.422 --> 21:39.005
So, have you calmed down?

21:39.255 --> 21:40.422
Screw you!

21:42.297 --> 21:43.297
Shit!

21:43.588 --> 21:45.047
Wait. What did you just say?

21:46.838 --> 21:47.838
Say it again, fatso.

21:48.713 --> 21:50.880
-I didn't hear you!
-Drop it, Morgane. Drop it.

21:50.963 --> 21:52.963
-OK, girls, time for bed!
-Yes, Mom.

21:53.047 --> 21:54.880
-Come on, Morgane, help.
-Come on.

21:54.963 --> 21:59.213
In my head, I was going to say "get lost,"
but it came out as "screw you."

22:00.713 --> 22:03.172
It was great. "Screw you" is perfect.

22:07.838 --> 22:10.380
-No, not here.
-I'm a bit scared now.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.005
Thanks.

22:13.588 --> 22:14.463
Oh, my God.

22:17.922 --> 22:21.005
-Who just put their finger in my ass?
-Can we stop talking about sex?

22:21.880 --> 22:23.630
-Good night.
-Good night.

22:34.088 --> 22:37.588
<i>Sleep with clenched fists</i>

22:38.047 --> 22:41.047
<i>Tomorrow, your faces will take the hit</i>

22:41.713 --> 22:43.630
<i>Sleep, but with ears open wide</i>

22:44.088 --> 22:47.422
<i>Tomorrow, your ears will be</i>
<i>A hunter's prize</i>

22:47.630 --> 22:50.172
<i>The end of summer camp is near</i>

22:50.505 --> 22:53.838
<i>Tonight's the last night you'll spend here</i>

22:54.297 --> 22:59.630
<i>Sweet dreams and say a prayer</i>
<i>Tomorrow, you'll wake up in a nightmare</i>

23:00.463 --> 23:03.713
<i>Sleep like a bird</i>
<i>That's no longer flying</i>

23:03.797 --> 23:06.797
<i>Or one that's nearly dying</i>

23:07.172 --> 23:10.547
<i>Go to sleep, little Falcons</i>

23:10.963 --> 23:13.297
<i>For tomorrow, you'll die too</i>

23:31.005 --> 23:31.838
OK.

23:32.297 --> 23:34.213
Can you just tell us who the fuck you are?

23:38.797 --> 23:39.713
Coffee?

23:53.297 --> 23:54.547
I should have guessed.

23:55.130 --> 23:56.088
Right, uh...

23:56.172 --> 23:59.005
Now we know who you are,
can you tell us what the costumes are for?

24:02.088 --> 24:04.463
-What do you want? Do you want to rape us?
-Stop it!

24:04.547 --> 24:05.422
What?

24:06.505 --> 24:09.130
There's no risk, we're not related!
He won't be interested.

24:09.213 --> 24:10.088
Great joke.

24:13.755 --> 24:15.213
No, really, what do you want?

24:15.297 --> 24:17.338
Do you want us to apologize?
OK, girls, say sorry.

24:17.922 --> 24:19.838
I'm sorry about your mouth.

24:20.047 --> 24:21.838
-Sorry.
-We're really sorry, honestly.

24:21.922 --> 24:22.755
We're so sorry.

24:23.297 --> 24:27.505
-Come on.
-I'm sorry about your little numbskull.

24:27.922 --> 24:28.880
OK, all good?

24:29.130 --> 24:31.505
Are we done here?
Because we need to get going.

24:33.088 --> 24:33.963
Hold on a minute.

24:34.588 --> 24:36.005
No, guys, seriously?

24:36.505 --> 24:37.880
Inbred hunters are old news.

24:37.963 --> 24:40.297
It doesn't scare anyone anymore, OK?
No, it's true.

24:40.380 --> 24:42.713
You need to find something new,
honestly, there's...

24:44.422 --> 24:45.380
I'm scared!

24:59.880 --> 25:01.213
Fuck me!

25:01.547 --> 25:03.005
Run, girls, run!

25:04.422 --> 25:05.463
Get out of here!

25:07.672 --> 25:10.422
Come back! I'm going to stick
all your arrows in your asses!

25:10.755 --> 25:11.880
In your ass!

26:13.088 --> 26:13.963
Help me!

26:33.588 --> 26:34.422
No!

26:41.380 --> 26:42.213
Stop pushing me!

26:42.297 --> 26:44.130
I'm not!
You're just not moving fast enough!

26:49.005 --> 26:51.713
Oh, my God, they're shooting!
Did they just kill someone?

26:51.797 --> 26:53.838
Morgane, calm down! Calm down!

26:53.922 --> 26:55.755
It could be nothing for all we know.

26:55.838 --> 26:57.380
How can I calm down, dumb-ass?

26:57.463 --> 27:00.088
"It could be nothing."
How do you come up with this shit?

27:00.213 --> 27:02.630
Are you a paid counselor
or just volunteering? Bitch!

27:02.755 --> 27:04.047
Right, stop it!

27:04.838 --> 27:07.255
That's the last time
you're going to speak to me like that!

27:07.338 --> 27:08.630
Yeah? Or you'll what?

27:08.713 --> 27:10.672
Shut the fuck up! Dammit, girls!

27:10.838 --> 27:12.297
Do you really think this is the time?

27:13.047 --> 27:14.838
Yeah, you think this is the time?

27:25.797 --> 27:27.672
-Let's see your hand.
-It's fine.

27:28.755 --> 27:29.630
It's nothing!

27:32.130 --> 27:34.088
Breathe, breathe, breathe...

27:34.172 --> 27:36.005
I'm in my garden. I'm in my garden.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.047
I'm in... This is all your fault!

27:38.505 --> 27:40.463
If you hadn't hit him,
we wouldn't even be here!

27:40.672 --> 27:42.547
You're a fucking psycho!

27:42.755 --> 27:43.880
What?

27:46.088 --> 27:47.922
I'm... I'm sorry. She was hysterical!

27:49.963 --> 27:51.213
Are you OK? Did I hurt you?

27:52.338 --> 27:54.672
We must leave the forest
and find the road.

27:55.797 --> 27:58.047
Listen to me!
I know how to survive in forests.

27:58.130 --> 27:59.547
I know what I'm talking about.

27:59.630 --> 28:01.755
We're all going to get out of here
safe and sound.

28:02.422 --> 28:04.505
I promise, everything will be all right.
I promise.

28:06.588 --> 28:07.630
The first rule...

28:08.088 --> 28:09.922
The most important rule, is to always...

28:41.713 --> 28:43.213
Run! Fucking run!

29:01.130 --> 29:02.672
OK, girls, you stay here.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.213
-And don't make a sound, OK?
-Why?

29:04.297 --> 29:06.005
-You're leaving?
-To scope the place out.

29:06.088 --> 29:07.588
I'll be more discreet on my own.

29:07.672 --> 29:09.005
-OK?
-No way!

29:09.838 --> 29:11.505
No way! I am not a babysitter.

29:11.672 --> 29:13.047
-I don't need you!
-Enough!

29:13.380 --> 29:14.255
Stay here!

29:15.088 --> 29:16.005
Don't make a sound.

29:16.880 --> 29:18.088
I'll have a look and come back.

29:18.547 --> 29:20.255
OK? OK?

29:22.672 --> 29:23.505
OK, Captain.

29:27.505 --> 29:28.672
Yeah, OK. We'll be fine!

29:44.213 --> 29:45.463
OK, we need to get out of here.

29:45.547 --> 29:47.338
Let's find the road,
find a car and leave. Go!

29:47.422 --> 29:49.172
-I'll never make it, Jeanne...
-No, no!

29:49.255 --> 29:51.047
Look at me! Lise, you must trust me.

29:51.130 --> 29:53.380
-I won't leave you. We'll be OK, OK?
-I'll go.

29:54.047 --> 29:55.713
-What?
-Dany needs me.

29:56.088 --> 29:57.255
-What?
-She's dead!

29:57.338 --> 29:59.505
I'll find the road, find Dany,
and come back for you.

30:00.713 --> 30:01.880
No, Tatiana. No, no, no!

30:01.963 --> 30:03.797
Come back, Tatiana. Come back! Fuck!

30:05.380 --> 30:07.380
-Take that off! Take it off!
-Why?

30:07.463 --> 30:08.380
Just take it off!

30:09.422 --> 30:11.880
-Run and make noise!
-But if we make noise, they'll follow us!

30:11.963 --> 30:13.005
Run!

30:13.713 --> 30:17.713
Shitty idea! Shitty idea! Shitty idea!

30:34.130 --> 30:35.255
Tatiana pisses me off.

30:35.963 --> 30:36.797
Huh?

30:37.213 --> 30:39.797
If she hadn't flipped out at the bar,
we wouldn't be here!

30:40.172 --> 30:42.672
Hold on, what about the kid
you punched in the face?

30:43.005 --> 30:45.463
Oh, so it's my fault now, is it?
Of course, silly me.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.880
It's always nasty Morgane's fault,
isn't it?

30:47.963 --> 30:50.297
Oh, stop playing the victim for once!

30:50.380 --> 30:51.297
The victim?

30:52.922 --> 30:54.755
Keep it up! You'll be the victim!

31:09.630 --> 31:11.755
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

31:11.963 --> 31:13.088
You'd better be careful!

31:14.380 --> 31:15.255
Hold on.

31:15.797 --> 31:17.047
Am I supposed to be scared?

31:18.213 --> 31:20.505
-You're pathetic!
-Stop it right now!

31:23.005 --> 31:24.588
-It's a fake!
-What?

31:25.172 --> 31:26.505
OK, girls, let's go.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.422
-Get off me!
-Let's go!

31:33.505 --> 31:34.672
Why are they doing that?

31:35.672 --> 31:36.547
It's pretty smart.

31:37.005 --> 31:40.463
Because not only does it freak us out,
but it makes us stay in the same area.

31:41.213 --> 31:42.505
What are we going to do now?

31:42.630 --> 31:44.963
She just said it.
We're getting out of here, idiot!

31:45.047 --> 31:47.005
-Stop it!
-Morgane!

31:47.088 --> 31:48.380
What? It's her, too.

31:50.047 --> 31:50.880
Pain in the ass!

31:51.797 --> 31:52.672
Crybaby!

32:39.755 --> 32:42.172
You left us, Coach. Why did you leave?

32:42.713 --> 32:43.588
I didn't mean to.

32:44.047 --> 32:46.588
It was... It was a reflex to run away.

32:47.047 --> 32:49.797
I was in front.
When the coach leaves, you follow.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.588
They stayed, they stayed.
That's their problem!

32:53.338 --> 32:56.588
If someone wants to die, they'll die.
It's the same with training.

32:56.672 --> 33:00.047
When I say "girls, get into position,"
they don't always get into position.

33:00.130 --> 33:02.672
And it's the same here -
if you see me leave, you follow!

33:02.797 --> 33:03.838
You don't stay behind,

33:04.297 --> 33:06.588
leaning on the van,
when there are guys with guns.

33:09.422 --> 33:10.255
Jeanne?

33:10.463 --> 33:11.797
-What?
-I need to talk to you.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.380
OK, but now's not the time. OK?

33:18.672 --> 33:19.547
But it's important.

33:20.130 --> 33:21.005
OK.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.088
Go on, tell me.

33:24.505 --> 33:25.422
Uh, I...

33:27.922 --> 33:28.755
I...

33:29.130 --> 33:30.047
You, you what?

33:32.213 --> 33:33.088
What is it?

33:34.922 --> 33:35.797
I slept with Serge.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.588
-What?
-I can explain.

33:39.588 --> 33:41.380
<i>I'm a moron</i>

33:41.463 --> 33:42.380
Stop that, Morgane.

33:42.505 --> 33:44.422
No, Captain, it's fine. I'm not listening.

33:57.338 --> 33:59.672
-What are you doing?
-That one isn't a fake.

34:05.172 --> 34:07.547
-What is he doing?
-I don't know!

34:22.588 --> 34:23.505
What was that?

34:24.130 --> 34:25.630
A prairie falcon, I think.

34:29.588 --> 34:30.630
Oh, fuck, he's seen us!

34:35.838 --> 34:39.297
I didn't leave them behind.
Think about it - I didn't abandon them.

34:39.380 --> 34:41.922
I wasn't being a coward,
it wasn't cowardly. It's just...

34:42.088 --> 34:45.005
Maybe I'm not that brave...
OK, think... think....

34:45.130 --> 34:47.755
You're the coach, you strategize!
How many of us are there?

34:47.922 --> 34:49.130
OK, there's one of me.

34:49.213 --> 34:51.297
I'm out of ideas, I'm out of ideas...

34:52.338 --> 34:53.213
Hey...

34:54.380 --> 34:55.838
What if I did leave them behind?

35:02.088 --> 35:02.963
Where are we?

35:03.047 --> 35:05.255
Up your ass!
With any luck, we'll run into Serge.

35:07.922 --> 35:09.463
It was an accident! An accident...

35:09.547 --> 35:11.255
An accident is when you slip
and break a leg!

35:11.338 --> 35:13.672
Did you slip and fall
on my boyfriend's dick?

35:14.130 --> 35:15.672
No, it wasn't like that.

35:15.755 --> 35:18.838
I mean, I was sweating
and I went into the changing rooms...

35:19.047 --> 35:20.172
Shut your fucking mouth!

35:20.255 --> 35:22.213
Spare me the details!
You're something else!

35:22.338 --> 35:23.463
You were my best friend!

35:25.922 --> 35:27.297
I've always wanted to be like you.

35:33.672 --> 35:34.755
It only happened twice.

35:36.255 --> 35:38.005
-OK. Five times max!
-Shut the fuck up!

35:38.255 --> 35:40.130
Morgane's right - you really are a moron!

35:58.588 --> 35:59.463
Fuck!

36:04.380 --> 36:08.088
-I'm sorry. Please, forgive me!
-Screw you.

36:20.338 --> 36:21.172
I hate you!

36:26.130 --> 36:27.463
-I'm sorry!
-Shut up!

36:36.880 --> 36:38.630
-I think they're gone.
-Shut up!

36:46.338 --> 36:47.422
Jeanne, wait for me!

36:51.838 --> 36:52.880
Got any chewing gum?

36:53.422 --> 36:54.588
How's that for an answer?

36:54.838 --> 36:56.380
No, but I think I swallowed some pee.

36:58.547 --> 36:59.380
Jeanne!

37:00.130 --> 37:01.047
I'm sorry!

37:02.463 --> 37:05.797
-Stop!
-Mr. Hunter! Please don't kill me.

37:05.880 --> 37:06.922
Do it, now!

37:28.713 --> 37:29.588
Fuck!

37:29.672 --> 37:31.922
What the fuck did you do? We had a plan!

37:41.713 --> 37:42.588
Help me!

37:46.963 --> 37:47.797
Help me!

38:05.547 --> 38:06.838
Did he knock your teeth out?

38:06.922 --> 38:08.797
No. They're not mine.

38:09.797 --> 38:10.630
Hazuki...

38:11.047 --> 38:12.505
Sorry, I didn't understand...

38:17.880 --> 38:18.838
You're fired.

38:20.422 --> 38:21.297
Come on, M.A.

38:28.255 --> 38:29.130
Jeanne?

38:29.463 --> 38:30.922
-Jeanne!
-What?

38:31.547 --> 38:33.755
I'll go that way.
They can't follow both of us.

38:33.838 --> 38:34.672
OK, on you go.

38:35.172 --> 38:36.755
-I'm going.
-Great! Go on then!

38:36.838 --> 38:38.255
-I am!
-Yeah, off you go.

38:38.422 --> 38:41.463
-Help me! Help!
-No, Lise, wait. Hold on, Lise...

38:41.963 --> 38:42.963
Fuck!

38:57.005 --> 38:58.463
Good luck, then!

39:00.922 --> 39:02.838
Help! Somebody help!

39:10.130 --> 39:11.713
Shit plan, shit plan!

39:39.630 --> 39:43.880
<i>There's nothing better than Jesus</i>

39:46.547 --> 39:50.755
<i>There's nothing better than Him</i>

39:50.838 --> 39:51.838
Please help me!

39:51.922 --> 39:53.630
Excuse me, you're interrupting the song!

39:53.713 --> 39:56.005
Sorry, sir, I'm really sorry but...

39:56.172 --> 39:58.755
I'm being followed by some freaks
who are trying to hunt us down.

39:58.838 --> 40:00.588
They've got hoods on and guns.

40:00.672 --> 40:02.797
They'll kill you all!
You're all going to die!

40:03.130 --> 40:04.672
Yeah, well, we'll all die someday!

40:04.755 --> 40:07.005
And the Lord will welcome us
to His house...

40:07.088 --> 40:08.838
-Yes!
-No, no, not like that. Please!

40:08.922 --> 40:10.255
-Everyone, together.
-No, sir...

40:10.338 --> 40:13.005
<i>And the Lord will welcome us</i>

40:13.588 --> 40:16.422
Listen to me, dammit!
You are really going to die, I swear!

40:16.672 --> 40:17.797
They'll kill all of you!

40:18.047 --> 40:19.797
You're all going to die!
Come with me, kids.

40:20.713 --> 40:22.047
Hey, hey! That's enough.

40:22.130 --> 40:23.172
Stop it!

40:24.713 --> 40:26.047
Fucking hell!

40:26.547 --> 40:27.463
That's enough!

40:28.005 --> 40:28.922
Are you nuts?

40:29.005 --> 40:30.255
-Fuck!
-Hey, come on.

40:30.338 --> 40:32.505
-Fuck!
-Here, Raymond. Catch.

40:32.630 --> 40:34.630
Oh, sorry. Sorry. I forgot...

40:35.172 --> 40:36.088
Are you ready?

40:36.255 --> 40:39.088
<i>The Lord will welcome us</i>

40:59.755 --> 41:02.713
I want to go home, far from here. Please.

41:02.797 --> 41:04.797
No, no, don't kill me.
Please, don't kill me!

41:05.088 --> 41:06.755
I'll do anything you want. Anything!

41:06.922 --> 41:07.963
We can make a deal, OK?

41:14.838 --> 41:15.672
Yeah!

41:27.588 --> 41:29.880
Do you want me to put the head on? OK!

41:52.005 --> 41:52.838
Hey!

41:54.172 --> 41:55.463
Hey! I'm over here!

42:23.130 --> 42:25.213
Hazuki. I know, I screwed up.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.838
You can't kick me out.

42:31.213 --> 42:33.880
What you did is really serious.
We're a team, we're united.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.588
It's not every person for themselves.

42:38.255 --> 42:39.672
You only think of yourself!

42:43.047 --> 42:44.172
You're not a Falcon anymore.

43:42.588 --> 43:43.672
Thanks!

43:46.672 --> 43:47.588
I'm sorry...

43:48.088 --> 43:49.005
I didn't mean to!

43:49.213 --> 43:50.630
It's not my fault, it's not me!

43:53.088 --> 43:53.922
Are you OK?

43:55.297 --> 43:56.130
Hazuki?

43:58.297 --> 43:59.130
What's going on?

44:14.713 --> 44:16.380
Oh, my God. I couldn't do anything.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.213
He killed her, he killed her!

44:19.422 --> 44:21.255
He took the machete and killed her!

44:21.505 --> 44:22.338
He killed her!

44:22.880 --> 44:23.713
Hazuki?

44:24.838 --> 44:26.713
I didn't do anything. It was an accident!

44:26.797 --> 44:28.505
Calm down, Morgane. Don't worry!

44:29.172 --> 44:30.672
You're going to be OK. I'm here!

44:31.130 --> 44:33.297
We're going to make it out of here -
both of us!

44:42.088 --> 44:42.922
You were...

44:43.922 --> 44:45.880
the best captain I've ever had.

44:47.547 --> 44:48.838
You never put me down.

44:49.797 --> 44:51.255
She never called me "fat ass."

44:52.755 --> 44:55.297
Hazuki, I will never forget you.

44:57.130 --> 44:59.588
I hope your successor
will be as nice as you were.

46:49.505 --> 46:50.463
Yes!

46:51.547 --> 46:52.422
OK.

47:55.547 --> 47:56.380
Hey, you.

47:56.797 --> 47:57.755
Hey, doggy!

47:58.422 --> 48:00.213
Come here. Come here. Yes.

48:00.505 --> 48:01.755
Do you want to eat a stone?

48:01.838 --> 48:03.172
Come on, there you go...

48:03.547 --> 48:05.838
Are you eating stones?
Yes, you are, little guy!

48:09.963 --> 48:11.380
Get off me! Get off my dick!

48:11.672 --> 48:12.588
Get off me!

48:21.172 --> 48:22.213
Not so smart now, are you?

48:49.130 --> 48:50.047
M.A.?

48:50.588 --> 48:52.255
M.A.!

48:52.588 --> 48:54.047
Jeanne! It's Jeanne!

48:58.797 --> 49:01.172
And the others? Where are they?

49:02.088 --> 49:03.088
Tatiana...

49:04.088 --> 49:05.255
She went to get help.

49:06.672 --> 49:07.505
Dany...

49:13.047 --> 49:14.588
And Lise, I don't know...

49:15.630 --> 49:17.297
We were arguing and she ran off.

49:17.380 --> 49:18.213
She told me...

49:20.838 --> 49:22.963
She told me she slept with Serge.

49:26.755 --> 49:27.713
And you?

49:29.755 --> 49:30.880
Hazuki is dead.

49:32.505 --> 49:33.505
They killed her.

49:34.588 --> 49:35.922
But she put up a good fight.

49:49.880 --> 49:50.713
Hold on.

49:59.922 --> 50:00.755
Fuck.

50:01.922 --> 50:03.005
It's out of gas.

50:06.547 --> 50:08.588
Hey, I think our RV's over there.

50:09.547 --> 50:12.130
My cell is inside. We need to go, guys.

50:56.130 --> 50:57.130
All clear.

51:00.672 --> 51:03.505
Wait! I'll keep a lookout out here, OK?

51:03.797 --> 51:06.255
If they come, imitate the prairie falcon.

51:06.755 --> 51:07.672
Remember?

51:13.172 --> 51:14.088
OK.

51:22.380 --> 51:24.088
Yeah, yeah. Yes! Yes!

51:24.963 --> 51:25.922
Go, go!

51:26.213 --> 51:28.047
-M.A., have you found a weapon?
-No.

51:28.130 --> 51:29.713
No, but I've got chips!

51:31.922 --> 51:34.547
-OK, good, I've got signal!
-Call the police.

51:41.547 --> 51:43.213
Yes, Jeanne, sweetie. Everything OK?

51:43.297 --> 51:46.005
<i>Motherfucker! You motherfucker!</i>
<i>I'm going to cut off your balls.</i>

51:46.088 --> 51:48.713
<i>You lying piece of shit.</i>
<i>You're dead! I swear, you're dead!</i>

51:52.172 --> 51:53.047
I got cut off!

51:53.130 --> 51:55.463
I haven't done anything wrong.
Is she crazy or what?

51:55.672 --> 51:57.672
Here. Leave it to me.

52:00.922 --> 52:02.130
Did you get the cops?

52:03.005 --> 52:04.838
No, my battery died.

52:05.130 --> 52:06.380
Oh, shit!

52:08.547 --> 52:09.838
-Well?
-Battery died.

52:09.922 --> 52:11.172
-Shit!
-Yeah.

52:11.255 --> 52:13.422
-What do we do now?
-I don't know.

52:13.838 --> 52:16.797
-I don't care. I'm out of here.
-No! We need to stick together!

52:16.880 --> 52:17.713
Hey!

52:21.672 --> 52:22.588
It's over.

52:23.297 --> 52:24.422
We're screwed.

52:25.797 --> 52:26.630
We're not screwed.

52:27.838 --> 52:28.922
We're a team.

52:29.505 --> 52:30.672
We're the Falcons.

52:31.380 --> 52:33.380
I mean... part of them.

53:41.213 --> 53:42.505
Spiker, spiker!

53:42.922 --> 53:44.047
Spiker, spiker!

53:44.380 --> 53:46.505
Spiker, spiker! Yeah!

53:59.213 --> 54:00.088
Jeanne! Jeanne!

54:00.505 --> 54:02.213
Help me! Help me!

54:02.963 --> 54:04.130
Don't leave me!

54:05.588 --> 54:09.047
Don't leave me! Please!
Don't leave me. Don't go.

54:23.338 --> 54:24.297
I'll come back.

54:24.380 --> 54:26.380
-I'll come back, I promise.
-No! No!

54:26.797 --> 54:28.922
I promise, I'll come back. I promise.

54:30.130 --> 54:31.255
I'll come back for you.

54:48.755 --> 54:49.588
Jeanne!

54:50.130 --> 54:50.963
Come on.

55:16.588 --> 55:18.672
-Let's get out of here!
-Jeanne!

55:19.755 --> 55:20.797
We can't leave.

55:22.213 --> 55:23.422
We have to go back.

55:25.713 --> 55:27.047
We're Falcons, right?

55:27.630 --> 55:30.963
If there's a chance that our friends
are still alive, we can't leave them.

55:31.463 --> 55:33.297
We can't just give up on them like that.

55:35.297 --> 55:36.172
Jeanne...

55:49.422 --> 55:50.880
Let's split up into two groups.

55:52.005 --> 55:54.505
So, you mean two groups of one person?

55:55.130 --> 55:56.588
We'll have a better chance that way.

56:24.213 --> 56:25.047
I'm begging you!

56:26.588 --> 56:29.213
No! I haven't done anything.
Let me go, please.

56:29.630 --> 56:31.797
-Please! Let me go!
-Morgane!

56:32.005 --> 56:34.547
-I want to go home!
-Don't scream. That's what they want.

56:34.630 --> 56:36.797
I haven't done anything.
I won't tell anyone. Please.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.630
Morgane, Morgane!

56:38.963 --> 56:41.005
Calm down. It's going to be OK.

56:41.172 --> 56:42.755
I'm here, I'm here.

56:44.088 --> 56:47.963
They're going to kill us!
I won't give them satisfaction.

56:48.172 --> 56:50.338
They're going to kill us?
I don't want to die!

56:50.422 --> 56:53.172
No! I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

56:58.797 --> 57:00.463
Please!

57:17.963 --> 57:19.797
Please!

57:23.130 --> 57:24.213
Please!

57:59.672 --> 58:00.630
My Dany...

58:01.297 --> 58:03.672
My darling, she is beautiful.

58:04.130 --> 58:05.630
She's so beautiful.

58:06.630 --> 58:07.963
My love.

58:10.297 --> 58:11.672
I missed you so much!

58:17.297 --> 58:18.505
Her ear.

58:18.588 --> 58:20.422
What did you do to her ear?

58:23.880 --> 58:25.755
No.

58:26.338 --> 58:27.505
No. No!

58:27.880 --> 58:30.755
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill all of you!

58:31.297 --> 58:34.505
I'll rip your heads off
and put them where your asses are!

58:34.588 --> 58:35.922
Get off me!

58:36.380 --> 58:37.547
Untie me!

58:37.713 --> 58:39.005
Untie me!

58:39.172 --> 58:41.922
Untie me! You fuckers!

58:45.588 --> 58:46.505
No!

59:48.380 --> 59:49.505
Please!

59:55.255 --> 59:57.047
Untie me!

59:57.130 --> 59:59.297
I don't believe it. No!

1:00:34.588 --> 1:00:35.880
I don't believe it!

1:01:17.338 --> 1:01:19.255
What is that? What's he doing?

1:01:21.672 --> 1:01:22.755
No, no!

1:01:43.088 --> 1:01:44.005
No.

1:01:44.838 --> 1:01:45.713
No.

1:01:50.755 --> 1:01:53.422
No, no. Why me? Why me?

1:01:53.505 --> 1:01:55.838
No, no, no. Mister! No, not me!

1:01:55.922 --> 1:01:57.713
No. Listen to me, mister. Stop!

1:01:57.797 --> 1:02:00.297
No, mister, I don't want to die.
I don't want to die!

1:02:00.380 --> 1:02:01.630
No!

1:02:01.963 --> 1:02:03.422
Please, no!

1:02:04.963 --> 1:02:06.672
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Stop!

1:02:07.047 --> 1:02:07.880
No!

1:02:09.380 --> 1:02:10.713
Take this one. Her. Yes, yes!

1:02:11.213 --> 1:02:12.130
Take her, mister. Yes!

1:02:12.213 --> 1:02:14.588
-Her, she's better! That's better.
-Fucking bitch!

1:02:15.588 --> 1:02:16.547
Take her!

1:02:18.005 --> 1:02:18.838
Bitch!

1:02:19.130 --> 1:02:21.130
-Her, she's better. Take her!
-Morgane, stop!

1:02:22.130 --> 1:02:24.088
You bitch, look at me!

1:02:25.005 --> 1:02:26.255
Look at me!

1:02:28.172 --> 1:02:29.963
You're a traitor!

1:02:30.547 --> 1:02:31.755
You bitch!

1:02:53.380 --> 1:02:55.297
The first one to move
will get his head blown off!

1:02:57.922 --> 1:03:01.047
Need a spiker, you fuckers?

1:03:01.130 --> 1:03:02.422
Don't mess with the Falcons!

1:03:22.297 --> 1:03:24.505
Stay back, or I'll fucking shoot!
I'll shoot!

1:03:29.213 --> 1:03:31.047
-Come on.
-M.A.! Help me, dammit!

1:03:45.338 --> 1:03:46.422
Yeah! Yeah!

1:04:46.755 --> 1:04:48.630
Motherfucker! Get out of here!

1:05:06.005 --> 1:05:07.755
Forrest, stop right there!

1:05:18.005 --> 1:05:20.755
Stay back, I said!

1:05:26.380 --> 1:05:29.630
M.A., get a fucking move on!
What are you doing?

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:32.005
Oh, what was that noise?

1:05:47.297 --> 1:05:48.130
Shit!

1:05:52.338 --> 1:05:53.338
Shit!

1:05:56.130 --> 1:05:57.297
I'm coming!

1:06:14.713 --> 1:06:16.755
-Coach?
-Sorry, girls, I was stuck in traffic.

1:06:18.630 --> 1:06:20.130
Come on! Come on!

1:06:25.088 --> 1:06:26.380
Come here, you!

1:06:28.755 --> 1:06:29.755
Let's go!

1:06:30.005 --> 1:06:32.547
Sorry, girls, I shouldn't have left you.
I'm a piece of shit.

1:06:32.630 --> 1:06:33.963
But I did tell you to run.

1:06:35.380 --> 1:06:37.588
Dammit, can't you see I'm talking?

1:06:39.463 --> 1:06:40.880
When I say no, I mean no!

1:06:51.130 --> 1:06:52.088
Watch out!

1:07:34.380 --> 1:07:35.755
Are you still here?

1:07:41.422 --> 1:07:43.297
Come on! What, are you giving up?

1:07:45.797 --> 1:07:47.088
Where are you going?

1:07:47.588 --> 1:07:49.213
Fuck, get off me!

1:07:56.172 --> 1:07:57.088
No!

1:07:58.922 --> 1:08:01.297
Get out of here! Come on, come here!

1:08:03.380 --> 1:08:04.213
What's wrong?

1:08:06.755 --> 1:08:09.338
So, you care about us, eh?
You care about the team?

1:08:22.213 --> 1:08:23.338
There isn't a team left.

1:08:26.422 --> 1:08:27.255
Lise!

1:08:32.130 --> 1:08:33.588
No! No!

1:08:37.005 --> 1:08:38.713
No! Lise!

1:08:45.088 --> 1:08:46.130
I love you.

1:08:47.088 --> 1:08:48.713
Me, too. I love you, too.

1:08:48.797 --> 1:08:50.047
I'm sorry about Serge.

1:08:50.463 --> 1:08:54.130
Who cares?
I don't care about Serge. Who cares?

1:08:59.422 --> 1:09:00.963
Fuck her up!

1:09:03.630 --> 1:09:05.047
No, no, no! Stay with me!

1:09:08.755 --> 1:09:11.255
Please, stay with me. Stay with me.

1:09:13.213 --> 1:09:14.547
No!

1:09:14.630 --> 1:09:16.213
Again? Come on!

1:09:17.713 --> 1:09:20.297
No, no, no, no, no.

1:09:21.422 --> 1:09:23.588
Morgane!

1:10:05.797 --> 1:10:06.630
Come on!

1:10:24.130 --> 1:10:26.255
Your boyfriend also prefers it
when I'm on top.

1:10:40.172 --> 1:10:41.422
I fucking love you, girls!

1:10:42.797 --> 1:10:44.297
Get out of here! Off you go!

1:10:44.380 --> 1:10:45.797
Jeanne! Jeanne! We need to go!

1:10:48.630 --> 1:10:50.422
Is that all you have, mate? Come on!

1:10:51.213 --> 1:10:54.172
-Where's Coach? Where's the coach?
-He's gone into overtime.

1:10:59.422 --> 1:11:00.255
Come here!

1:11:08.547 --> 1:11:09.463
Is that it?

1:11:10.380 --> 1:11:12.588
Get out of here! Go!

1:11:13.213 --> 1:11:14.422
And what about you?

1:11:15.297 --> 1:11:16.130
So?

1:11:25.338 --> 1:11:26.588
No!

1:11:43.380 --> 1:11:47.172
<i>The moral of our tale</i>
<i>You may well have understood</i>

1:11:47.547 --> 1:11:51.422
<i>Play volleyball well</i>
<i>And your chances of survival are good</i>

1:11:51.547 --> 1:11:55.213
<i>But a second moral says</i>
<i>Never give up hope</i>

1:11:55.380 --> 1:11:59.755
<i>If someone cuts your leg off</i>
<i>You'll probably still cope</i>

1:11:59.922 --> 1:12:03.880
<i>Now I've finished my storytelling</i>
<i>It's time to return to your dwelling</i>

1:12:04.255 --> 1:12:08.005
<i>Try and find yourself some work</i>
<i>Get a shrink or go beserk</i>

1:12:08.255 --> 1:12:11.797
<i>One more piece of advice, girls</i>
<i>I hope it's understood</i>

1:12:12.005 --> 1:12:15.797
<i>Never tell your life story</i>
<i>To weird guys in the woods</i>

1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:18.505
<i>Oh, oh, oh, Falcons, Falcons</i>

1:12:18.797 --> 1:12:20.380
<i>Falcons, Falcons</i>

1:12:20.755 --> 1:12:24.297
<i>Falcons, Falcons, Falcons, Falcons...</i>

1:12:26.297 --> 1:12:28.463
-Sweetheart?
-Something you'd like to tell me?

1:12:28.797 --> 1:12:29.963
Yes. I...

1:12:31.213 --> 1:12:33.005
Is there something different about you?

1:12:40.963 --> 1:12:42.213
Too bad for your balls!
