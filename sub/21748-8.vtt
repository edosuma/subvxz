WEBVTT

00:11.970 --> 00:14.973
So I send in the form,
and if my mom wants to meet me too,

00:15.056 --> 00:16.266
-then we meet?
-Yeah.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.726
And if she doesn't want to meet me,

00:17.809 --> 00:21.187
then I get to feel that hot sting
of rejection all over again.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.273
What a fun adventure this all is.

00:23.356 --> 00:27.610
You know what <i>is </i>fun? You coming with me
to my first day on my new show.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.613
"BoJack Horseman
in <i>F.H.B.A. Los Angeles,</i>

00:30.697 --> 00:33.575
starring BoJack Horseman
as 'the Judge.'"

00:33.658 --> 00:35.118
What is <i>F.H.B.A.</i>?

00:35.201 --> 00:38.329
I think it's one of those shows
about Navy sex crimes that have gone cold?

00:38.413 --> 00:41.916
And there may be numbers or something?
Then, they call "the Judge."

00:42.000 --> 00:43.918
I'm just excited to get out of the house.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.421
I've been getting really fidgety
cooped up on that hill.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.214
Like I got tiny little bumps
crawling around

00:48.298 --> 00:49.716
on the inside of my skin, you know?

00:49.799 --> 00:53.094
Totally. Look at this guy,
texting in the middle of the intersection.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.139
You have been judged
to be a shitty driver.

00:56.222 --> 00:59.559
I'm the Judge.
I sentence you to kiss my ass.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.560
Boom!

01:00.643 --> 01:01.978
You got "judged."

01:03.897 --> 01:06.399
It feels good
to be a dramatic actor again.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.276
To make someone laugh
is a craft, to be sure,

01:08.359 --> 01:11.696
but to make someone cry, on purpose,
that is a precious gift.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.616
Hey, I'm Miles, the production intern.
Can I get you anything? Water?

01:14.699 --> 01:16.034
That's so sweet of you.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.911
Actually, that's so his job of him.

01:17.994 --> 01:21.372
-Hey, PA, whose name I already forgot.
-It's Miles, and I'm an intern.

01:21.456 --> 01:24.167
Still not interested. Can you take
my daughter to "video village"?

01:24.250 --> 01:26.503
I wanna make sure she sees me
at my most awesome,

01:26.586 --> 01:29.422
which is with a slightly high angle
to avoid appearance of a double chin.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.340
Note to director.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.716
-Right this way.
-Okay.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.635
-[bell rings]
-[assistant director] Quiet!

01:33.718 --> 01:34.552

On <i>Booty Academy,</i>
we're here to find out

03:06.352 --> 03:10.315
who's got the right behind
and who's going to be left behind.

03:10.398 --> 03:14.319
BoJack, do you have anything
you'd like to say to the contestants

03:14.402 --> 03:16.237
before we give our verdict?

03:16.946 --> 03:18.406
No, I'm good.

03:18.489 --> 03:21.993
Very well.
Calliope, you are "ready for this jelly."

03:22.076 --> 03:23.661
You can stay another week.

03:23.745 --> 03:26.998

03:27.081 --> 03:28.958
Cover up your bottom and go.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.044
No!

03:31.127 --> 03:33.504

-Callin' my manager!
-Remind me what this show is?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.803
-I know, remind me?
-[Tasha] ...my publicist!

03:40.887 --> 03:42.931
<i>Felicity Huffman's Booty Academy.</i>

03:43.014 --> 03:44.057
It was supposed to be

03:44.140 --> 03:46.684
<i>Felicity Huffman's</i>
<i>Future Leaders of America,</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:49.062
but it got retooled a little
by the network.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.147
So are we judging who has the best booty?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.359
Whoa, BoJack, no.
That is so degrading.

03:54.442 --> 03:57.862
So if it's not about their butts,
then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot?

03:57.946 --> 04:00.114
Because I'm an honest and impartial judge.

04:00.198 --> 04:04.077
And if there's one thing I'm famous for,
it's that I cannot lie.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.954
Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.455
Hey, can we go home now?

04:07.538 --> 04:10.875
Being around all these skinny L.A. ladies
makes me feel like a blob.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.003
Well, I gotta shoot
for, like, ten more hours.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.129
Are you serious?

04:15.213 --> 04:19.759
Apparently, it takes three hours to set up
the "badonka-donka-dobstacle course."

04:19.842 --> 04:23.429
So making TV is like a full-time job?
Then why is it so bad?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.682
I just assumed people weren't trying.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.018
Uh, I don't mean to butt in here,
but shouldn't your daughter be in school?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.896
Shouldn't you be
"Sir Minding-Your-Own-Business-A-Lot"?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.315
I graduated early and took a gap year.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.609
My friend Maryssa is backpacking
through Europe,

04:36.693 --> 04:40.321
but lucky me, I get to hang out
in this butt-infested warehouse.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.239
Oh. All right.

04:41.322 --> 04:43.533
Someone better be checking
the pH levels of that Jacuzzi

04:43.616 --> 04:45.118
because these bitches are basic.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.036
Hey, you wanna explore the back lot?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.706
They got a whole area that was built
to look like downtown Toronto.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.749
That's where they shoot the stuff
set in New York.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.626
Are you allowed to just leave the set?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.169
What are they gonna do? Dock my pay?

04:55.253 --> 04:57.547
I'm an intern. They don't pay me.
I got all the power!

04:57.630 --> 04:58.464
[laughing]

05:02.093 --> 05:06.764
Princess Carolyn,
you are going to love Stilton Acres.

05:06.848 --> 05:10.268
We have a sauna and a tennis court
and a giant hedge maze.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.521
And if you make it all the way through
the maze, you get some sugar water.

05:13.604 --> 05:16.024
And you're gonna love
the Feast of Saint Squeaky.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.067
It's the holiest of all mouse holidays.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.402
We prepare a feast of Swiss--

05:19.485 --> 05:21.237
Because it's the holiest of all cheeses?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.614
Because it was all our ancestors
could carry

05:23.698 --> 05:26.117
when they were trying to escape
for their lives.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.535
Oh-- because it has <i>holes!</i>

05:27.618 --> 05:28.786
-That's very funny.
-Thanks.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.747
I really want you and my parents
to get along.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.708
They can be kind of a lot,
especially around the holidays.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.543
I'm sure I'm going to love them.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.463
And they're gonna love me.
I'm Princess Carolyn!

05:38.546 --> 05:39.464
I'm sure they will too.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.174
But let's wait
until after they love you

05:41.257 --> 05:43.342
to tell them about, you know, Philbert.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.261
Of course. But what about her?

05:45.344 --> 05:46.679
Don't worry. She's on her phone.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.307
Unless Ralph and Princess Carolyn's
secret baby starts to trend,

05:49.390 --> 05:51.476
she won't notice anything we do or say.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.729
-Stefani? Stefani?
-[phone clicking]

05:55.563 --> 05:57.482
-[squishes]
-Whoa.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.113
Katrina!
Just the person I wanted to talk to!

06:04.197 --> 06:05.990
<i>-How's hotel life?</i>
-Marvelous!

06:06.074 --> 06:09.494
Room service, tiny ketchup bottles,
handy list of cable channels.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.246
Now I know why so many people
like being homeless.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.499
-Mr. Peanutbutter, that's not--
-On the phone, darling.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.585
Well, I just found you
the perfect new campaign headquarters.

06:17.668 --> 06:18.920
I'm gonna sign the lease now,

06:19.003 --> 06:20.630
unless you think of a reason
I shouldn't.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.589
Nothing comes to mind.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.383
Great! It's done.
Now, what did you wanna talk to me about?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.469
-I'm dropping out of the race.
-What?!

06:26.552 --> 06:28.554
Woodchuck's a better leader
than I'll ever be.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.933
This election is about bigger things
than just you and Woodchuck.

06:32.016 --> 06:32.975
What is it about then?

06:33.059 --> 06:35.603
It's about hope, and freedom,
and powerful lobbyists

06:35.686 --> 06:37.730
who pay me to elect
a governor I can control

06:37.814 --> 06:41.317
so we can get legislation passed
that allows them to build private prisons

06:41.400 --> 06:43.236
on what are now protected wetlands.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.030
Well, hopefully those evil lobbyists
can find some other puppet

06:46.114 --> 06:47.115
to do their bidding.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.199
Why would you hope that?

06:48.282 --> 06:50.535
I'm done running for governor,
so you're fired.

06:50.618 --> 06:51.869
No hard feelings, right?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.372
You idiot. I will end you!

06:54.455 --> 06:56.040
-Bye, Cruella!
-[Katrina screams]

06:59.919 --> 07:01.379
-[mother] Hello.
-[father] Stefani!

07:01.462 --> 07:02.922
-Hello.
-Oh, darling, you're home.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.507
-Nice to meet you.
-Princess Carolyn!

07:04.590 --> 07:07.385
-Hello.
-I'm Poppy! This is my wife, Mimi.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.345
And this is our son, Sissy.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.638
And this is my wife, Missy.

07:10.721 --> 07:13.474
And the boys,
Tweeds, Nantucket, and Loophole!

07:13.558 --> 07:14.392
Ugh.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.519
It's so wonderful to meet you all!

07:16.602 --> 07:18.771
-Can I get you a cocktail?
-Oh. No, thank you.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.939
-Wine?
-That's all right.

07:20.022 --> 07:23.317
I will consider it a personal affront
if you won't at least have a beer.

07:23.401 --> 07:25.528
-I shouldn't.
-What about a very caffeinated coffee?

07:25.611 --> 07:26.612
-No.
-Raw shellfish?

07:26.696 --> 07:27.864
-Not tonight.
-Cigarette?

07:27.947 --> 07:29.198
-I don't smoke.
-That's okay.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.075
You can just stand around me
while I smoke.

07:31.159 --> 07:31.993
No, I don't want to.

07:32.076 --> 07:32.910
Cocaine, then?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.996
I so appreciate that,
and I hate to be rude,

07:35.079 --> 07:36.831
but I really don't think it's a good idea.

07:36.914 --> 07:39.083
Would you like me to punch you
in the belly real quick

07:39.167 --> 07:41.169
so you remember
what it's like to be alive?

07:41.252 --> 07:42.628
That's a rich person thing.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.547
Oh, I know.
I grew up around rich people.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.675
But I'm actually good,
as far as belly-punchings go.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.344
Well, can I at least offer you a ride
on our private rollercoaster?

07:50.428 --> 07:52.805
Surely, there's no reason
you wouldn't want to do that.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.974
-So if you decline, I will be offended.
-Oh.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.434
Also, not that it's relevant,

07:56.517 --> 07:58.561
but the rollercoaster
is specifically discouraged

07:58.644 --> 08:00.396
for children under five
and pregnant women.

08:00.563 --> 08:02.106
But since you are neither of those,

08:02.190 --> 08:04.317
obviously, there's no reason
you will not want to ride

08:04.400 --> 08:06.736
on our family's really fun rollercoaster.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.113
-Okay, look, the truth is--
-Hey, Dad!

08:09.197 --> 08:11.991
Why don't you tell Princess Carolyn
one of your great golf stories?

08:12.074 --> 08:13.659
-Say, there's an idea.
-Yes!

08:13.743 --> 08:17.121
So here I am with a mashie
when what I need is a niblick.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.706
[all laughing]

08:18.789 --> 08:21.584
Wow, golf. Fore! Am I right?

08:21.667 --> 08:24.545
Yes, that's exactly right. Golf.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.088
[camera shutters clicking]

08:27.006 --> 08:30.259
Californians, this is an endorsement!

08:30.343 --> 08:31.677
My message is simple.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.598
If you want to vote Peanutbutter,
vote Coodchuck-Berkowitz

08:35.681 --> 08:38.976
because a vote for Coodchuck-Berkowitz
is a vote for Peanutbutter.

08:39.060 --> 08:39.894
Uh--

08:39.977 --> 08:42.813
Since Peanutbutter
likes Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

08:42.897 --> 08:46.776
So if you like Coodchuck-Berkowitz,
vote like Mr. Peanutbutter...

08:46.859 --> 08:49.612
-Excuse me--
-...for Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

08:49.695 --> 08:53.157
So if we want to vote for Woodchuck,
we should vote for you?

08:53.241 --> 08:54.075
-No.
-Yes.

08:54.158 --> 08:56.452
-By voting for Woodchuck.
-Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.246
I look forward to moving past

08:58.329 --> 09:00.498
the political divisiveness
of this campaign

09:00.665 --> 09:03.125
and <i>finally </i>focusing on the issues.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.502
What's with the gorilla feet?

09:04.585 --> 09:05.962
[sighs]

09:06.045 --> 09:07.088
As I've explained before,

09:07.171 --> 09:09.257
my hands were crushed
during the fracking incident.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.509
There were no hand transplants
readily available,

09:11.592 --> 09:14.011
but gorilla feet are somewhat hand-like.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.097
So I am using them temporarily

09:16.180 --> 09:19.642
while my doctors
find me more suitable replacements.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.436
[laughs]
They sure made a monkey out of you, huh?

09:22.520 --> 09:24.188
-[reporters laugh]
-They did no such thing.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.273
Gorillas are apes.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.566
I feel that went pretty well.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.277
Yes, well, thank you
for dropping out of the race.

09:29.360 --> 09:33.239
Rest assured, under my stewardship,
the state will be in good--

09:33.322 --> 09:35.616
-You were gonna say "hands," weren't you?
-Ugh.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.785
So, what's next for us two amigos?

09:37.868 --> 09:40.830
Mr. Peanutbutter,
we don't need your help on the campaign.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.000
We are running virtually unopposed.
I think our team can handle it from here.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.209
Wha-wha-wha-what?

09:45.293 --> 09:48.796
The best way you can help us
is to go back to your regular life

09:48.879 --> 09:51.215
and stay out of politics forever.

09:51.299 --> 09:56.053
So this chapter of my life is over?
Doggy, doggy. What now?

09:56.637 --> 09:57.763
Coochy-coochy-coochy...

09:57.847 --> 09:59.599
Hey, Mom.
You got something in the mail.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.810
Have I received
any gentleman callers today?

10:02.893 --> 10:05.980
I'm expecting a visit
from Corbin Creamerman.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.231
You know what? I'll check.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.067
You could learn a thing or two
from him, Henrietta!

10:10.151 --> 10:10.985
Mm-hmm.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.113
-Hey, where have you been?
-I'll make coffee.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.531
Oh, uh...

10:15.615 --> 10:18.242
well, Miles actually took me
to check out UCLA.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.911
He took me to a party,
and I got to sleep in a dorm room, and...

10:20.995 --> 10:23.414
Wow, look at the time.
That's enough questioning of me,

10:23.497 --> 10:25.916
and where I've been,
and what I've been doing. See ya later!

10:26.000 --> 10:28.044
Hold up.
Did you and that PA hook up last night?

10:28.127 --> 10:30.504
BoJack! We didn't just hook up.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.465
Miles is a really interesting soul,

10:32.548 --> 10:34.925
-and I feel like we connected.
-Oh, boy. Okay. Sit down.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.637
Hollyhock, you are never gonna hear
from that guy again.

10:37.720 --> 10:38.971
Okay, actually, I am,

10:39.055 --> 10:41.098
because when I left his dorm
he said he would,

10:41.182 --> 10:43.351
and I quote, "Definitely text me."

10:43.434 --> 10:44.935
Oh, wow, I didn't realize.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.646
Should we plan the wedding for you

10:46.729 --> 10:49.523
and teenage-boy-you-slept-with
who-said-he-would-definitely-text-you"?

10:49.607 --> 10:50.608
Very funny.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.860
Believe me, I take no pleasure
in telling you this,

10:52.943 --> 10:55.780
-but that kid is never, ever, ever--
-[phone chimes]

10:55.863 --> 10:58.616
-Ooh! BoJack--
-Hollyhock, it is very rude to interrupt.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.659
Now, where was I?

10:59.742 --> 11:03.537
Right. You'll never <i>ever</i>
hear from this guy again.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.622
-But, I--
-Ba-ba-ba!

11:04.705 --> 11:07.833
In fact, if he texts you,
I will do a hundred pushups.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.462
That's how sure I am,
since there is no possible way--

11:11.545 --> 11:13.798
"Had a great time last night. Kilometers."

11:13.881 --> 11:14.715
"Kilometers"?

11:14.799 --> 11:17.093
It's an inside joke between me and Miles.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.136
Not inside enough.
I figured it out and it's dumb.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.139
-[phone chimes]
-He wants to take me to a party tonight.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.058
-Shouldn't you be doing pushups?
-[sighs]

11:25.393 --> 11:26.644
Nope, can't. Impossible.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.437
Anyone who says
they did a pushup is lying.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.481
-[phone chimes]
-That him canceling? Classic move.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.525
No, he wants to spend the day together.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.527
Oh. Well, you wanna
have breakfast first?

11:34.610 --> 11:36.529
I got a box of crullers,
of which one remains.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.030
Nah, I'm good with this coffee.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.907
I'll be home for dinner, though. Bye!

11:40.908 --> 11:41.742
Okay.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.121
Forty-six, 47...

11:45.204 --> 11:48.833
-Ah! I could do this all day.
-[groans]

11:49.959 --> 11:52.294
-[horn honking]
-[gasps, whimpers]

11:53.295 --> 11:58.050
We have gathered in Todd's new apartment
to discuss the future of PB Livin'.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.635
You told me this was an intervention

11:59.718 --> 12:02.138
to get Todd to stop coming up
with awful ideas.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.014
That was a pretense
to get you to show up.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.808
-What?
-It was Todd's idea.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.101
What else you got, Todd?

12:07.184 --> 12:11.147
Well, I got this one thing.
I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.441
-You bite your tongue.
-Yes, bite it all the way off!

12:13.524 --> 12:15.985
All your ideas are beyond terrible.

12:16.068 --> 12:19.363
Well, in that case, I guess I must have
"terrible" business instincts.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.990
-You do!
-Because I wanna hear it.

12:21.073 --> 12:24.285
They say "the devil's in the details,"
so let's summon the devil!

12:24.368 --> 12:26.036
Okay, so you know how hard it is

12:26.120 --> 12:28.664
-to get your kids to go to the dentist?
-I don't.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.709
But what if dentists
had a friendlier face?

12:31.792 --> 12:33.002
Ooh!

12:33.085 --> 12:35.629
What if you could take your kids
to a dentist's office

12:35.713 --> 12:38.090
where all the dentists were clowns?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.259
-What?!
-Kids love clowns!

12:40.342 --> 12:42.136
-Do kids love clowns?
-Actually--

12:42.219 --> 12:44.972
Don't they?
Who else would clowns be for?

12:45.055 --> 12:46.932
Because adults don't love clowns.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.768
That is true.
Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.480
So kids <i>must </i>love clowns,

12:52.563 --> 12:55.065
because otherwise,
why would there be clowns?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.442
That is sound logic. Okay.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.153
I want these clown dentists
laughing maniacally

12:59.236 --> 13:02.823
as they drill into the teeth
of America's children, starting yesterday!

13:02.907 --> 13:06.160
As someone who <i>does </i>have children,
I have to say,

13:06.243 --> 13:09.663
a lot of kids
are actually <i>terrified </i>of clowns!

13:09.747 --> 13:10.748
Are they? Hm.

13:10.831 --> 13:13.375
That would have been helpful information
before I committed.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.587
But my word is my bond
and I already said yes, didn't I?

13:16.670 --> 13:19.757
Okay, so do we find dentists
and train them to be clowns,

13:19.840 --> 13:22.301
or do we get clowns
and train them to be dentists?

13:22.384 --> 13:25.888
Why don't we get clowns and dentists
and they can train each other?

13:25.971 --> 13:29.725
Oh, somebody call the police department,
because you are <i>on fire!</i>

13:29.808 --> 13:32.019
[groans] Aw, jeez.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.020
[all chuckling]

13:33.103 --> 13:34.688
And without missing a beat, I say,

13:34.772 --> 13:37.733
"Well, when life gives you lemons,
make an Arnold Palmer."

13:37.816 --> 13:39.193
[all laughing]

13:39.276 --> 13:42.321
It's been so wonderful getting
to know you all these last few days.

13:42.404 --> 13:46.283
We're so happy to have you.
Now, let the festivities begin.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.119
-Sissy, hand out those cat ears.
-Cat ears?

13:49.203 --> 13:51.038
-And this is for you.
-I want those.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.540
See, the feast is about remembering

13:52.623 --> 13:55.000
the ancient tale of a heroic mouse
named Squeaky.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.587
And we always start by wearing cat ears
and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.631
the cat tyrant, King Pusspuss.

14:00.714 --> 14:05.344
Looks like Princess Carolyn
won't need any cat ears to look evil.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.470

<i>♪ I'm a stinky cat</i>
<i>Who never takes a bath ♪</i>

14:18.524 --> 14:21.694
Okay, that's actually a stereotype.
Cats do take baths.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.238
Darling, licking yourself
does not qualify.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.447
[family laughing]

14:25.531 --> 14:27.950

Oh! Right in the cat gut!

14:38.419 --> 14:39.628
Hooray!

14:39.712 --> 14:41.338
Sorry, it gets a little graphic.

14:41.422 --> 14:45.593
I really wish you'd told me
your family's holiday was so anti-cat.

14:45.676 --> 14:49.805
It's just an old story about one bad cat.
It's not about every cat.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.266
-Death to all cats!
-Whoo-hoo!

14:52.349 --> 14:54.310
-[Stefani] All right!
-I forgot about that part.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.352
It's kinda like church.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.022
You say the words so many times,
you forget what they mean.

14:58.522 --> 14:59.732
Oh-hh...

15:04.069 --> 15:06.071
-[yelps] Agh!
-Hello, Hollyhock.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.948
[clicks]

15:08.032 --> 15:10.951
Oh, come on. Wait there.
There's a spare bulb in the kitchen.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.871
I've been sitting in that chair
for five hours waiting to do this.

15:15.289 --> 15:18.292
-[crashing]
-Agh, damn it! Son-of-a--! What?

15:18.375 --> 15:19.668
[huffing]

15:20.544 --> 15:21.378
[clicks]

15:21.462 --> 15:23.881
-Hello, Hollyhock.
-What are you trying to do?

15:23.964 --> 15:27.343
I'm trying to keep you out of trouble
with a showman's flair for the dramatic.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.178
I texted you I was gonna be home late.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.971
You don't tell me when
you're home late.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.098
This is my house.
You need to ask permission.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.935
-What? You're not my dads.
-I'm just looking out for you.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.020
You spent four days
with this kid, I'm worried--

15:38.103 --> 15:40.731
There's nothing to worry about!
We like each other.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.983
Yeah, now. But come on, Hollyhock.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.568
[stammers, sighs]

15:44.652 --> 15:45.903
He's a teenage boy

15:45.986 --> 15:49.031
whose job is to be around hot women
in skimpy outfits all day.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.658
You think he's gonna want--

15:50.741 --> 15:51.575
What?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.202
No, I just mean that...

15:53.285 --> 15:55.245
What, you think
I'm not attractive enough for him?

15:55.329 --> 15:58.374
Well, you're the one
who said you were a blob.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.501
-Do you think I'm a blob?
-No.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.212
What kind of person
calls his own daughter a blob?

16:03.295 --> 16:05.547
-You said "blob."
-I said I "felt" like a blob.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.591
Do <i>you </i>think I'm a blob?

16:07.675 --> 16:08.676
I just-- [sighs]

16:08.759 --> 16:12.805
I just think L.A. is a superficial town
and you need to be careful.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.140
Well, Miles likes me just the way I am.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.893
And that's the kind of person
that I want to spend my time with.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.854
Hollyhock, wait. Wait. Wait!

16:20.938 --> 16:23.565
I get it! It's my weight!

16:28.529 --> 16:30.948
Yeah... I'm sorry about all that.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.574
Why didn't you tell me they hate cats?

16:32.658 --> 16:33.534
They don't hate cats.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.495
Now I get why you didn't want
to tell your family about the baby.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.789
Okay, I was a little nervous.
But they'll come around.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.917
Besides, what am I supposed to do?
They're my family.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.087
-And what are me and Philbert?
-[sighs] Oh...

16:50.300 --> 16:51.635
Can't believe she's still pissed.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.303
You shouldn't have called her a "blob."

16:53.387 --> 16:56.056
I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!

16:56.140 --> 16:59.184
How about just as a general rule,
don't ever call a woman a blob?

16:59.268 --> 17:03.022
Never! What if I meet a woman
whose name is Barbara Lob?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.399
And I call her "B" for short. "B. Lob."

17:05.482 --> 17:08.068
Maybe instead of figuring out
the woman blob workaround,

17:08.152 --> 17:09.987
you should just tell Hollyhock
you're sorry.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.031
I still think Miles is up to something.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.532
Why is it so hard for you to believe

17:13.615 --> 17:15.367
someone could genuinely
like your daughter?

17:15.451 --> 17:17.202
Because she's like me!

17:17.286 --> 17:22.708
Okay. Do you think maybe this could be
more about <i>you </i>than it is about her?

17:22.791 --> 17:25.878
Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work
to do on myself. Everyone knows that.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.881
But the important thing right now
is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.591
Try to stay on topic, Diane.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.010
Well, an open conversation
about your concerns with--

17:33.093 --> 17:35.637
No, that's too Diane-y.
She'd never buy it was coming from me.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.014
Then why do you want my advice?

17:37.097 --> 17:40.184
I got it. If I can somehow prove to her
what a jerk Miles is,

17:40.267 --> 17:42.352
then she'll have to like me more
by default.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.645
That's the BoJack way.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.231
BoJack, no--!
Oh-- oh...

17:46.315 --> 17:48.358
Ooh, that's... that's nice.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.903
Goldie, how would you like
to advance to the final round?

17:50.986 --> 17:55.240
I would do anything, and I mean, anything.

17:55.949 --> 17:59.244
-So I did it. I had sex with the PA.
-You had sex with him?

17:59.328 --> 18:00.913
That's what you wanted, right?

18:00.996 --> 18:02.998
I just said "seduce" the PA.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.708
Doesn't that mean have sex with him?

18:04.792 --> 18:08.378
No, I just wanted you to,
like, get him all hot and bothered.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.506
-Eh...?
-And <i>ready </i>to sleep with you.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.216
Then once you get him on audiotape

18:12.299 --> 18:14.093
-saying that he would sleep with you...
-What?

18:14.176 --> 18:16.762
...come up with some excuse to get
out of there with virtue intact.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.640
That's a lot of specifics
you just assumed I would know.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.851
Okay, well, the important thing is,
we got him now.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.020
Tell Miles what you told me.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.439
-I had sex with the PA.
-What PA?

18:27.523 --> 18:30.651
I think his name was "Eggberg"?

18:30.734 --> 18:32.694
-What? Not him?
-That's the intern.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.823
-You said "PA."
-Did you think I was a PA? Nice!

18:35.906 --> 18:37.407
Why'd you want her to sleep with me?

18:37.491 --> 18:38.492
Not sleep with.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.788
You told a contestant
you would advance her to the final round

18:42.871 --> 18:44.289
if she slept with a PA?

18:44.373 --> 18:46.667
I said "seduce." There is a distinction.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.294
We make a show about empowering women
and lifting them up,

18:49.378 --> 18:52.297
and you cheapen it
with this coarse vulgarity.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.633
I cannot lie. You disgust me.

18:54.716 --> 18:56.218
This was all a big misunderstanding.

18:56.301 --> 18:58.804
Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.

18:58.887 --> 19:03.225
You're not fit to judge
anyone's character, or their booties.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.436
So it <i>is </i>about judging booties.

19:07.020 --> 19:07.855
[groans]

19:07.938 --> 19:09.356
-Hey, BoJack.
-Miles.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.567
Don't want me dating your daughter,
you could have told me.

19:11.650 --> 19:12.693
I'm sorry.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.070
Maybe we could've worked out
some sort of deal.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.321
What do you mean?

19:16.405 --> 19:19.408
All right, so I got this screenplay,
and I think it's a really fresh area.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.035
It's about a production intern
who wants to be a writer.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.120
Oh, wow.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.039
I think it could go somewhere
if it got in front of the right person.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.584
So if you have like an agent
or a manager you could give it to,

19:28.667 --> 19:31.837
that would be awesome,
and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.

19:31.920 --> 19:32.921
I promise.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.927
So you were right. He <i>was </i>a dirtbag.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.847
Yeah. I was kinda hoping
I was wrong for once.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.265
If it makes you feel any better,

19:43.348 --> 19:45.475
you were wrong
about all the other parts of this.

19:45.559 --> 19:48.478
Diane, you are so bad
at making people feel better.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.855
Are you gonna tell Hollyhock?

19:49.938 --> 19:52.566
She's a smart girl.
She'll figure it out eventually.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.528
But for now, if she believes someone
can love her for who she really is,

19:56.612 --> 19:58.197
then why would I take that
away from her?

19:58.280 --> 20:02.492
BoJack, you gotta get
one of these massages.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.119
-Oh-hh!
-Okay.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.247
-[Mimi] Goodbye, darling.
-[Sissy] It was good seeing you.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.500
-It was so much fun seeing you both.
-Thank you for hosting us.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.252
It was so nice to get away for the week

20:12.336 --> 20:14.338
and learn all about
your charming little traditions

20:14.421 --> 20:16.173
that didn't freak me out at all. Bye-bye!

20:16.256 --> 20:19.009
Did our little city mouse
have a nice time in the country?

20:19.092 --> 20:20.093
Everything was wonderful.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.639
And your little companion was darling--
for a week.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.433
But I do hope the next one you bring home
knows how to appreciate

20:26.516 --> 20:28.435
a good Feast of Saint Squeaky.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.978
Well, for your information,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.022
there's not gonna <i>be </i>a "next one,"
because...

20:32.105 --> 20:35.692
I love Princess Carolyn and we're having
a baby and I couldn't be happier!

20:35.776 --> 20:37.110
[Mimi] Oh, my God.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.158
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, I am so relaxed.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.410
I didn't realize
how much tension I'd built up in my--

20:45.494 --> 20:49.039
Oh, my God! Um...

20:49.122 --> 20:54.002
Mr. Peanutbutter, why is our hotel room
filled with dentist clowns?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.921
Don't be ridiculous, Diane.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.798
They're not all dentist clowns.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.675
Half of them are clown dentists.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.969
Just try to ignore them
and go about your business.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.929
-Okay.
-So, this is the incisor.

21:04.012 --> 21:05.764
Doc, if this is what's incisor,

21:05.847 --> 21:08.517
I'd hate to see what's outsides 'er.
Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk!

Well, there's no way

22:03.488 --> 22:05.324
No? Because I almost beat him
