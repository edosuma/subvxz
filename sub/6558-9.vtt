WEBVTT

01:23.459 --> 01:26.504
Say, Scooby,
kind of a spooky night, huh?

01:28.839 --> 01:30.508
Yeah, spooky.

01:33.135 --> 01:37.807
The aroma of this pizza is, like,
driving me wild.

01:40.184 --> 01:43.187
You wanna eat it now?
Like, right this minute?

01:43.354 --> 01:46.732
- Yeah, yeah!
- Man, this is gonna be delicious.

01:46.941 --> 01:51.362
After all, we only had two
blockbuster pizzas at the Pizza Palace.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.197
That's hardly even a snack.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.828
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

01:59.078 --> 02:04.000
I always wanted to be a pizza chef.
Watch this.

02:08.504 --> 02:12.550
Well, thanks for leaving my finger.

02:12.967 --> 02:16.887
Maybe that's the gang
in the Mystery Machine.

02:29.025 --> 02:31.610
Hey, mister! You lost something!

02:31.777 --> 02:33.237
Hey! Hey!

02:34.196 --> 02:37.575
I guess he didn't hear me.
Let's go see what it is.

02:40.745 --> 02:45.291
It's a violin case.
It feels kind of heavy.

02:52.798 --> 02:57.595
Heh, yeah, I know, and you never had
a lesson in your life.

02:57.762 --> 03:01.766
Holy moly! What's this?
It's full of money!

03:03.017 --> 03:07.313
- There must be thousands of dollars.
- Millions.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.482
- Here, hold this.
- Me?

03:09.648 --> 03:13.152
Yes, you. Guard that
while I 90 phone the gang.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.610
Uh-oh.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.987
Trouble.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.448
What's wrong?

04:16.298 --> 04:20.302
Yipes! It's gone! I goofed.

04:21.387 --> 04:25.641
What happened, Scooby?
Where's the violin case full of money?

04:26.183 --> 04:29.562
I got you.
You put the case on the curb.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.648
- Yeah.
- Then what?

04:32.815 --> 04:37.486
- Girl dog.
- A girl dog with big eyelashes.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.033
She was in trouble.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.496
You put the violin case down
and went over to see her.

04:47.663 --> 04:52.168
And while you were gone,
someone took the case.

04:52.334 --> 04:56.338
- Show us where the girl dog was.
- Okay.

04:56.881 --> 04:58.382
Here.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.343
Let's look around.
There might be a clue.

05:01.510 --> 05:04.847
It'd be better if we knew
what we were looking for.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.891
What's this?

05:07.433 --> 05:11.103
It's a puppet control.
I wonder what it's doing here.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.773
Let me see it.
Something is written on this control.

05:15.524 --> 05:20.029
"Pietro's Puppets." That must be
the puppet show at the Strand.

05:20.196 --> 05:22.781
You think the other dog was a puppet?

05:22.948 --> 05:24.033
Yeah, yeah.

05:24.200 --> 05:28.746
So it was the girl-dog puppet
that lured you away from the violin case.

05:28.913 --> 05:32.249
- Right! Right!
- We have ourselves a little mystery.

05:32.416 --> 05:37.046
Let's examine the clues:
A puppet dog, a violin case...

05:37.213 --> 05:41.425
packs of brand-new bills.
Very strange.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.720
They don't seem to hold together.
Unless...

05:44.887 --> 05:46.764
- You've got it.
- That's it.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.558
Counterfeiters!

05:56.440 --> 06:00.945
The thing to do is get in the Strand
Theater and look around. But how?

06:01.111 --> 06:04.281
How about getting an audition
for a trained dog act?

06:04.448 --> 06:07.368
- "Trained dog"?
- That's a great idea.

06:07.952 --> 06:10.120
Trained dog?

06:13.290 --> 06:18.671
Don't look now, fans, but I think
a star is about to be born.

06:21.799 --> 06:25.386
- There's someone inside.
- Likely a watchman or a doorman.

06:25.928 --> 06:28.347
Look, he's working a puppet.

06:28.514 --> 06:32.059
Could be another clue for us, all right.
Let's go inside.

06:33.352 --> 06:37.940
- Hello.
- Well, hello. What can I do for you?

06:38.107 --> 06:42.111
We're inquiring about arranging
an audition for our trained dog.

06:42.319 --> 06:46.824
He's a great talent. Do a bit, Scooby.

06:52.121 --> 06:56.041
Well, that was pretty good.
What do you say, Johnny?

06:56.208 --> 07:01.422
No. Sorry, chum, but you can't
work this show unless you're a puppet.

07:01.589 --> 07:07.761
- You're very good. You a puppet master?
- No, I just fiddle with them as a hobby.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.265
You're okay with me, Pop.

07:12.725 --> 07:16.353
Well, you certainly seem professional.

07:17.396 --> 07:22.443
Well, why not?
The great Pietro has helped me.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.570
Uh-oh!
- How long have...?

07:28.782 --> 07:33.787
- What's with him?
- Yeah, what's with you, Scooby-Doo?

07:34.663 --> 07:37.499
A Witch! A Witch!

07:37.666 --> 07:43.672
A witch? I get it. One of the puppets
scared you. Okay, let me up.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.716
You'll have to excuse him.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.969
That's okay. I'll go put Johnny away.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.723
Shaggy, look.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.938
Look what I got. A brand-new bill,
just like in the violin case.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.940
Quick, hide it.

08:02.483 --> 08:06.945
- Now, about that audition-
- Not right now. We've really got to go.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.697
- What?
- What's the rush?

08:08.906 --> 08:11.283
Freddy's right. We really gotta go.

08:11.450 --> 08:15.287
Well, we sure enjoyed the puppets.
Goodbye.

08:15.454 --> 08:19.708
Anytime. Anytime. Goodbye.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.919
Hmm.

08:24.922 --> 08:28.926
Well, why the rush?
We didn't get a chance to look for clues.

08:29.093 --> 08:35.182
- Show them the clue, Shaggy.
- It was in the doorman's desk drawer.

08:35.349 --> 08:39.853
- A brand-new $20 bill.
- And I'll bet you a doughnut it's a phony.

08:40.020 --> 08:44.358
- It sure looks real.
- Let's change it into a blockbuster pizza.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.193
Yeah!

08:46.360 --> 08:51.657
Be serious. My expert opinion
on the authenticity of this bill is:

08:51.824 --> 08:56.829
- It's absolutely genuine.
- That 20 was planted to throw us off?

08:56.995 --> 08:59.415
- How come?
- Yeah, like, why?

08:59.581 --> 09:02.543
To make us think nothing fishy
was going on there.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.962
So we wouldn't think of going back.

09:05.129 --> 09:09.133
- I get it. But now what do we do?
- We go back.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.009
Huh?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.554
Oh, no.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.475
We're in luck. The doorman's asleep.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.854
Come on, the door's unlocked.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.839
Let's give this stage
a good going-over.

09:49.006 --> 09:53.385
- What are we looking for?
- Clues, of course. Any kind of clues.

09:53.552 --> 09:57.931
Why not start here
in the clues closet?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.435
Nope.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.313
Nothing here.

10:06.565 --> 10:09.943
Shaggy, that's the worst joke
I ever heard.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.737
Be serious, you guys.

10:11.904 --> 10:15.824
Let's split up and start searching.
Everybody know the signal?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.744
- Do you know the signal, Scooby?
- Sure.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.461
- Quiet.
- Sorry.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.798
Yeah, like, watch it.

10:31.298 --> 10:36.637
You stay close to Scooby. We don't
want any more noise. Okay? Let's go.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.849
Wow. There's a lot of
searching to do around these old sets.

10:41.058 --> 10:44.812
- We better split up and look around.
- Right.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.190
Don't forget,
if you see anything suspicious...

10:48.357 --> 10:50.776
bark three times.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.113
Huh?

10:55.280 --> 10:59.868
- Scoob, watch what you bump into.
- I didn't do it.

11:00.077 --> 11:05.332
A guy could get hurt around here.
Come on, let's look somewhere else.

11:10.921 --> 11:14.341
Gee, Velma,
I wish we had a clue to a clue.

11:14.508 --> 11:20.138
Don't worry, Daphne. If we stick around
here, we're bound to find something.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.352
Wow, we almost got hit
by that sandbag!

11:25.519 --> 11:28.188
Yeah, I guess the rope
must have broke.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.234
Broke, nothing.
Look. It's been cut with a knife.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.612
And ropes don't cut themselves.

11:41.493 --> 11:45.205
- Let's look in the dressing room area.
- Okay, Shaggy.

11:45.372 --> 11:49.668
There should be a lot of junk
in here to check over.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.720
- Let's browse around here a bit.
- Right.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.399
Ooh.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.946
Hmm?

12:31.543 --> 12:34.379
- What's with you, Scooby-Doo?
- He's after me!

12:34.546 --> 12:37.591
- He's after you?
- Yeah, yeah!

12:37.758 --> 12:39.384
Aww.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.387
It's only a jack-in-the-box.

12:50.354 --> 12:55.275
- Stop clowning around and keep looking.
- Right.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.446
Wow. Funny faces.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.617
Hey, Scooby, check this.
Pretty heroic, huh?

13:05.911 --> 13:07.579
Yeah, yeah.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.581
Watch this.

13:14.086 --> 13:17.255
That's great. Hold it a sec. Aha!

13:17.422 --> 13:19.758
The cloaked cavalier.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.177
That's a doozy.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.771
Uh-oh!

13:37.651 --> 13:42.322
- There were two of you!
- There were two of me? I don't get it.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.449
Give me.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.326
Two of you.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.121
You saw somebody dressed like me?

13:49.287 --> 13:53.291
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let's get out of here!

13:56.712 --> 13:59.131
I wish I knew what we were looking for.

13:59.297 --> 14:04.177
- We'll know when we find it.
- Yeah, if we find it.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.471
Daphne. Velma. Come over here.

14:12.811 --> 14:15.814
I saw him!
He was in that prompter's box!

14:15.981 --> 14:18.316
Run! Get out of here!

14:18.483 --> 14:23.655
- There's a guy in a black cape around.
- He was in that prompter's box.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.825
We ought to see what's in there.
Right, Scooby?

14:26.992 --> 14:28.702
Not me.

14:28.869 --> 14:33.999
Here's a Scooby Snack.
No strings attached. Just catch.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.170
Dirty trick.

14:38.336 --> 14:40.839
What's down there, Scooby?

14:44.718 --> 14:48.722
- Violin cases.
- Violin cases?

14:49.347 --> 14:53.769
Well, come on.
Let's get down below stage. Quick.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.525
- What now? They're all empty.
- Not even violins in them.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.195
Maybe this thing
is a wild-goose chase.

15:03.361 --> 15:06.740
How about that man in the black cape?
Explain him.

15:06.907 --> 15:12.037
And Scooby, he saw that man
in the black too, didn't you?

15:14.748 --> 15:18.919
Somebody's playing the big organ
on the stage.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.223
He's gone!

15:31.723 --> 15:33.725
It must have been our imagination.

15:33.892 --> 15:36.728
Well, that was the first time
I ever heard mine.

15:43.902 --> 15:48.240
- What was that?
- I don't like looking for clues anymore.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.168
That's the one.

16:05.841 --> 16:08.760
Look, Scooby has a dog puppet.

16:09.094 --> 16:12.597
So this is the canine Mata Hari.

16:14.266 --> 16:17.811
What's sticking out
of that puppet's stuffing?

16:19.688 --> 16:24.442
What a clue! It's the front
engraving plate for a $20 bill.

16:24.609 --> 16:28.321
Time to wake that doorman up
and tell him what's going on.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.866
Good idea. Let's go.

16:31.992 --> 16:37.664
Mr. Doorman, wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

16:38.123 --> 16:39.958
It... It...

16:40.125 --> 16:44.838
- He's a puppet too!
- That's all for me, fans.

16:46.798 --> 16:50.343
We're locked in! But good.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.138
But we've got to get out
with this important Clue.

16:57.851 --> 17:01.646
- There goes the plate, our only clue!
- What will we do now?

17:01.813 --> 17:08.195
We're going back to that violin case
room and give it another going-over.

17:13.825 --> 17:17.954
- Okay, how do we start?
- Look for something out of the ordinary.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.832
Take a good look around.

17:22.709 --> 17:27.339
- That harp case could hide something.
- I wonder if it's empty too.

17:29.299 --> 17:33.261
It's sure not empty.
It's got a whole room in it!

17:33.637 --> 17:37.140
Wow! We hit the jackpot.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.851
Look at that printing press!

17:40.018 --> 17:43.271
And all those new
$20 bills on the table.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.942
You were right, Freddy,
it's a big counterfeit operation.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.948
It's him!

17:55.533 --> 18:00.121
- Yipes!
- Double yipes! Let's get out of here!

18:04.668 --> 18:07.045
There's a door up ahead!

18:15.136 --> 18:18.348
You know my secret!

18:18.515 --> 18:22.811
- Golly! Where's that voice coming from?
- In this tunnel. Who knows?

18:25.313 --> 18:27.148
It's a dead end!

18:27.315 --> 18:30.902
This ladder's our only way.
But I can't see where it goes.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.530
We got no Choice. Start climbing.

18:42.664 --> 18:46.334
- Where are we?
- I'm not sure.

18:48.837 --> 18:54.009
You have learned
my secret. Now you can never go!

18:54.759 --> 18:57.012
Come on, think of something.

18:58.680 --> 19:02.350
Look, one man isn't too heavy.
If we all push together...

19:02.517 --> 19:05.687
- maybe we can throw him off.
- Okay, let's go.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.608
Where did he go?

19:10.775 --> 19:14.404
- Where are we?
- Back on the stage.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.782
Careful, everybody.
He's around here some place.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.784
Wait for me.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.544
- Wait a minute.
- Me, wait? Why?

19:29.711 --> 19:33.715
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Remember the doorman?

19:33.882 --> 19:36.968
- He was a life-sized puppet, wasn't he?
- Yes.

19:37.135 --> 19:40.805
- What do you think these are?
- You're right: Puppets.

19:41.014 --> 19:44.559
Then there must be a puppet master.

19:53.068 --> 19:57.113
- There he is! We've got to catch him!
- Look at Scooby-Doo!

20:03.411 --> 20:08.041
How do you like that?
Old Scooby-Doo's got him on the run!

20:14.756 --> 20:18.093
Good work, Scooby!
I'll give you a hand!

20:30.605 --> 20:36.444
You deserve a lot of credit. This town's
been flooded with phony 203 for weeks.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.279
It was nothing, really.

20:38.446 --> 20:41.449
But old Mr. Pietro,
posing as the doorman...

20:41.616 --> 20:44.119
sure had us fooled for a while.

20:44.285 --> 20:48.289
