My signatures are all over those boxes.

00:13.990 --> 00:15.703
I cannot be audited.

00:15.823 --> 00:18.080
Circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.621
And I need your help.

00:19.741 --> 00:21.828
No one needs to go to Mexico.

00:21.851 --> 00:23.999
The cartel wants your formula.

00:26.879 --> 00:29.663
Now get the fuck out of here
and never come back.

and I-- I guess I'm going to have
to go ahead without you,

03:20.562 --> 03:23.626
so call me.

03:27.498 --> 03:32.436
Oh. Hey, happy birthday,
sweet sixteen.

03:32.471 --> 03:33.905
Mwah.

03:33.939 --> 03:35.206
[giggles]
Thanks, Mom.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.308
Of course, I thought
you might sleep through it.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.010
Ha ha.
[chuckles]

03:39.045 --> 03:42.848
So since it's almost--
oh, noon,

03:42.882 --> 03:45.250
I think your first
big birthday decision

03:45.284 --> 03:48.086
is breakfast or lunch.

03:48.121 --> 03:49.688
Um, pancakes?

03:49.722 --> 03:52.223
Pancakes it is.

03:52.258 --> 03:54.292
Okay, could you do me a favor?

03:54.327 --> 03:55.360
I forgot to get the paper.

03:55.394 --> 03:56.528
Can you go out
and grab it for me?

03:56.562 --> 03:58.730
Sure.
Thanks.

04:12.013 --> 04:13.447
[Skyler]
Surprise!

04:15.150 --> 04:17.051
It's from me and your dad.

04:17.084 --> 04:18.687
It's pretty slick, huh?

04:19.689 --> 04:21.822
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

04:21.857 --> 04:24.358
It's-- It's great.

04:25.727 --> 04:28.028
You know, I really did
a lot of research,

04:28.063 --> 04:29.597
and, I don't know,

04:29.631 --> 04:31.165
this car just really
stood out to me.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.668
It's got a ton
of great features--

04:33.702 --> 04:35.703
power everything, solid engine,

04:35.737 --> 04:36.971
It's really roomy,

04:37.005 --> 04:39.940
so you can carpool
with all your friends,

04:39.975 --> 04:41.575
and of course it is safe

04:41.609 --> 04:43.310
because I am still your mother.

04:43.344 --> 04:45.512
Oh, and it has a CD player,

04:45.547 --> 04:47.414
so you can listen to some tunes
while you're cruising around,

04:47.449 --> 04:48.716
so you know what?

04:48.750 --> 04:50.418
Breakfast can wait.

04:50.452 --> 04:52.687
You want to take it for a spin?

04:52.721 --> 04:55.123
Um, m-m-maybe later.

04:55.157 --> 04:57.158
I'm kind of starving.

04:57.192 --> 04:59.161
Yeah, okay.
Well, let's--

04:59.195 --> 05:02.197
let's get those pancakes going.

Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

05:26.756 --> 05:28.924
Yeah. Hi.

05:28.958 --> 05:30.292
Have a seat, please.

05:31.661 --> 05:33.829
I--

05:33.863 --> 05:35.631
I don't really understand
why I'm here.

05:35.665 --> 05:37.266
Is it something to do
with my creditors?

05:37.300 --> 05:40.268
Creditors? No.

05:40.303 --> 05:41.970
I'll cut right to the chase.

05:42.005 --> 05:44.373
Mr. Beneke,
I have some bad news.

05:44.408 --> 05:46.042
Uh...

05:46.076 --> 05:47.510
nothing but, lately.

05:47.544 --> 05:49.912
Your great-aunt Birgit
passed away.

05:50.914 --> 05:52.081
I'm sorry, who?

05:52.115 --> 05:53.815
Uh...

05:53.850 --> 05:56.017
Apparently, she passed away

05:56.052 --> 05:57.252
in Diekirch, Luxembourg,

05:57.286 --> 05:59.821
and this was, wow,
eight years ago.

05:59.855 --> 06:01.589
I just assumed
you two were close,

06:01.623 --> 06:02.790
given that--

06:03.892 --> 06:06.560
Well, maybe this is good news.

06:06.594 --> 06:07.628
[chuckles]

06:07.662 --> 06:09.697
Birgit left behind
a sizable estate,

06:09.731 --> 06:13.133
of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

06:13.168 --> 06:16.670
- What? - Yeah, well, seems she had
no immediate relatives,

06:16.704 --> 06:18.605
so the estate's
just been sitting

06:18.640 --> 06:19.973
while the folks over in the EU

06:20.007 --> 06:22.175
searched for a living heir.

06:23.912 --> 06:28.082
I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg,

06:28.117 --> 06:30.118
definitely no one who
would name me in their will.

06:30.153 --> 06:31.353
Huh.

06:33.390 --> 06:34.624
Well...

06:36.594 --> 06:37.928
Ah, here you go.

06:37.963 --> 06:39.463
She left no will,

06:39.498 --> 06:41.933
so that's probably
why it took so long.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.001
They traced the inheritance
through to your father,

06:44.036 --> 06:45.203
but his having passed--

06:45.237 --> 06:46.371
my condolences--

06:46.405 --> 06:48.473
you are the next in line

06:48.508 --> 06:54.581
to the tune
of $621,552.33.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.121
Wow.

[vehicle rumbling]

08:15.730 --> 08:19.633

09:03.448 --> 09:05.249
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

09:16.995 --> 09:18.429
They synthesize their own.

09:19.764 --> 09:21.365
What?

09:23.135 --> 09:24.869
I don't-- I don't do that.

09:27.707 --> 09:30.709
Look, I get
my phenylacetic acid

09:30.743 --> 09:32.244
from the barrel
with the bee on it.

09:32.278 --> 09:34.347
That's how I know how to do it.

09:52.032 --> 09:53.299
What is he saying?

09:53.334 --> 09:54.468
We're working it out.

09:54.502 --> 09:55.702

10:02.076 --> 10:06.880
Tell this asshole if he wants to
learn how to make my product,

10:06.914 --> 10:10.083
he's got to do it my way,
the right way.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.691
I speak English.

10:17.725 --> 10:21.061
So you understand
what asshole means.

10:21.095 --> 10:24.997
Now, go get me my
phenylacetic acid, asshole.

10:26.634 --> 10:29.335
How long is it going to take you
to get him what he needs?

10:29.369 --> 10:31.638
I don't know.
I have no idea.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.107
Several hours at least.
I can wait.

about the state of this lab.

Don't you have standards?

10:40.781 --> 10:43.215
I mean, this place
is disgusting.

10:43.249 --> 10:46.050
All right, we're going to scour
every vat, every tank,

10:46.085 --> 10:48.018
every cook surface,

10:48.053 --> 10:51.154
and then we're going to clean up every
possible source of contamination,

10:51.188 --> 10:55.057
and only then we cook.

Okay?
What is it?

20:21.351 --> 20:24.953
I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke,

20:24.987 --> 20:29.257
which I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

20:29.291 --> 20:33.127
Yes, but it is better
than prison. Correct?

20:33.161 --> 20:34.461
Marginally,

20:34.496 --> 20:36.830
which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

20:36.865 --> 20:38.332
All right, good.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.835
Yeah, I can't believe
he actually bought it--

20:40.869 --> 20:42.470
"Great-aunt Birgit."

20:42.505 --> 20:45.107
What?
But you called it.

20:45.141 --> 20:47.610
I guess people see those zeroes
dance before their eyes,

20:47.644 --> 20:49.112
it's kind
of like highway hypnosis.

20:49.146 --> 20:50.213
All right,
so what's the problem?

20:50.247 --> 20:52.215
Let's just say you and I

20:52.249 --> 20:54.317
don't wear the same
rose-colored glasses

20:54.351 --> 20:56.486
where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned,

20:56.520 --> 20:58.087
so I kept an eye
on his bank accounts,

20:58.121 --> 20:59.822
and I pulled his credit report.

20:59.856 --> 21:02.958
If you would,
note the time on that.

21:06.296 --> 21:10.567
3:54 p.m. yesterday.

21:10.601 --> 21:12.536
Three hours
after leaving my office.

21:12.570 --> 21:15.940
He bought a Mercedes SL550.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.343
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4,500 down.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.078
He's going to pay
1,830 a month--

21:20.112 --> 21:21.546
fully loaded.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.548
I mean, he even got
the heated steering wheel,

21:23.583 --> 21:25.484
but that's upwards of 6,300

21:25.519 --> 21:28.421
that won't be going to the IRS.

21:28.455 --> 21:29.589
I just thought
you might like to know,

21:29.623 --> 21:32.926
loath as I am to say
I told you so.

21:38.900 --> 21:40.134
Where is he now?

22:07.295 --> 22:08.462
[chuckles]

22:24.979 --> 22:26.680
[sighs]

22:38.828 --> 22:39.994
Hey.

22:40.996 --> 22:42.930
[groans]

22:44.066 --> 22:45.399
How you doing?

22:48.203 --> 22:49.937
Good.

22:57.512 --> 22:59.480
How are you?

23:01.049 --> 23:04.753
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

23:06.655 --> 23:07.956
I called her last night.

23:11.327 --> 23:15.163
I told her I was spending
the night at Louis'.

23:15.197 --> 23:17.231
It's cool.

23:17.266 --> 23:21.703
So h-h-how are you?

23:24.773 --> 23:26.240
I'm fine, son.

23:26.274 --> 23:27.475
I--

23:31.046 --> 23:32.379
I--

23:34.082 --> 23:38.585
I took these painkillers

23:38.620 --> 23:40.620
that I had left over
from my surgery,

23:40.655 --> 23:43.490
and I made
the brilliant decision

23:43.525 --> 23:45.892
to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

23:48.329 --> 23:51.397
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit,

23:51.432 --> 23:54.800
but I'm fine.

23:55.802 --> 23:58.204
I wish I could take back
last night.

23:58.238 --> 24:00.406
It was your birthday.
This shouldn't be on your mind.

24:00.441 --> 24:02.074
It's okay.

24:02.109 --> 24:03.242
No, it's not okay.

24:03.277 --> 24:04.844
I'm your father,

24:04.878 --> 24:06.613
and I don't want

24:06.647 --> 24:09.082
last night to be--

24:09.116 --> 24:14.054
I mean, you really--

24:14.088 --> 24:17.257
you can't think of me like...

24:18.759 --> 24:20.094
Like what?

24:23.932 --> 24:27.101
I don't understand.

24:39.381 --> 24:41.749
My father died when I was 6.

24:41.783 --> 24:42.983
You knew that, right?

24:43.018 --> 24:44.218
Yeah.

24:47.055 --> 24:49.023
He had Huntington's Disease.

24:49.057 --> 24:51.926
It's--

24:51.960 --> 24:55.397
destroys portions of the brain,

24:55.431 --> 24:58.867
affects muscle control,
leads to dementia.

24:58.901 --> 25:01.102
It's just a nasty disease.

25:01.137 --> 25:03.305
It's genetic.

25:03.339 --> 25:05.473
It terrified my mother
that I might have it,

25:05.507 --> 25:08.977
so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid,

25:09.012 --> 25:10.745
but I came up clean.

25:12.481 --> 25:18.487
My father fell very ill
when I was 4 or 5.

25:18.521 --> 25:20.355
He spent a lot of time
in the hospital.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.525
My--

25:25.394 --> 25:26.728
[chuckles]

25:26.762 --> 25:29.297
My mother would tell me
so many stories

25:29.331 --> 25:31.766
about my father.

25:31.801 --> 25:33.735
She would talk about him
all the time.

25:35.271 --> 25:38.072
I knew about his personality,

25:38.107 --> 25:40.008
how he treated people.

25:40.042 --> 25:42.143
I even knew how he liked
his steaks cooked--

25:42.177 --> 25:43.411
medium rare.

25:43.445 --> 25:45.279
[both chuckle]
Just like you.

25:47.749 --> 25:51.319
I knew things about my father.

25:51.353 --> 25:52.887
I had a lot of information.

25:52.921 --> 25:56.690
It's because people
would tell me these things.

25:56.724 --> 26:00.227
They would paint this picture

26:00.261 --> 26:03.631
of my father for me,

26:03.665 --> 26:05.800
and I always pretended

26:05.834 --> 26:08.403
that was who I saw, too,

26:08.437 --> 26:09.804
who I remembered,

26:09.839 --> 26:12.207
but it was a lie.

26:12.242 --> 26:19.315
In truth, I only have one real,
actual memory of my father.

26:22.719 --> 26:25.487
It must've been
right before he died.

26:25.521 --> 26:28.222
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him,

26:28.257 --> 26:31.292
and I remember
the smell in there,

26:31.326 --> 26:32.660
the chemicals.

26:32.694 --> 26:35.429
It was as if they use up

26:35.464 --> 26:38.032
every single cleaning product
they could find

26:38.066 --> 26:39.667
in a 50-mile radius...

26:41.237 --> 26:44.106
like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

26:45.842 --> 26:47.576
Oh, there was this stench

26:47.610 --> 26:49.111
of Lysol and bleach.

26:49.145 --> 26:51.146
You could just feel it
coating your lungs.

26:52.249 --> 26:56.719
Anyway, there,
lying on the bed,

26:56.753 --> 26:58.221
is my father.

27:00.891 --> 27:04.559
He's all--
He's all twisted up.

27:07.597 --> 27:13.335
And my mom,
she puts me on her lap.

27:13.369 --> 27:14.937
She's sitting
on the bed next to him

27:14.971 --> 27:17.839
so I can get
a good look at him...

27:19.041 --> 27:21.543
but really he just scares me...

27:25.014 --> 27:27.682
and he's looking right at me...

27:29.651 --> 27:33.253
but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

27:38.827 --> 27:41.028
And your grandmother

27:41.062 --> 27:42.696
is talking,

27:42.730 --> 27:46.833
trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does,

27:46.868 --> 27:49.936
but the only thing
I could remember

27:49.971 --> 27:52.940
is him breathing.

27:55.243 --> 27:57.411
Oh, th-- this--

27:59.513 --> 28:03.182
this rattling sound,

28:03.217 --> 28:06.919
like if you were shaking
an empty spray-paint can.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.420
Huh?

28:13.192 --> 28:15.560
Like there was nothing in him.

28:20.966 --> 28:22.267
Anyway...

28:25.505 --> 28:29.341
that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

28:34.114 --> 28:38.183
I don't want you to think of
me the way I was last night.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.821
I don't want that

28:42.855 --> 28:44.789
to be the memory you have of me

28:44.823 --> 28:46.324
when I'm gone.

28:48.127 --> 28:51.029
R-Remembering you that way...

28:53.198 --> 28:55.166
wouldn't be so bad.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.839
The bad way to remember you
would be the way--

29:02.241 --> 29:05.310
the way you've been
this whole last year.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.781
At least last night
you were--

29:09.815 --> 29:12.149
you were real.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.751
You know?

29:20.725 --> 29:21.925
Bye.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.791
Somewhere you should be?

29:57.563 --> 30:00.265
Basically it was
a temporary hiatus,

30:00.299 --> 30:01.466
but you give us two weeks,

30:01.501 --> 30:04.636
we will be up and running 100%.

30:04.671 --> 30:07.239
All right, you talk to your
people and get back to me. Okay?

30:09.709 --> 30:11.710
Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

30:11.744 --> 30:13.111
Okay, you bet.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.513
Say hi to the kids for me.

30:14.547 --> 30:16.615
Hey.
Hi.

30:17.651 --> 30:18.951
Nice surprise.

30:18.986 --> 30:20.286
What's up?

30:20.320 --> 30:22.789
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things were going.

30:22.823 --> 30:24.324
Well, things are--

30:24.358 --> 30:26.260
[chuckles]
...things took a turn.

30:26.294 --> 30:27.361
It's kind of crazy.

30:27.395 --> 30:28.728
Oh, yeah?

30:28.763 --> 30:30.130
I think the universe is trying
to tell me something.

30:30.165 --> 30:32.633
I've got some good news,
some very good news,

30:32.667 --> 30:36.236
and getting
the business going again.

30:38.306 --> 30:39.639
Wow.
[chuckles]

30:39.674 --> 30:41.975
Yeah, I figure
we haven't been down long,

30:42.010 --> 30:43.744
so we should be able to get
most of our old contracts back.

30:43.778 --> 30:45.012
Sit down.

30:45.046 --> 30:46.413
Oh, thank you.

30:46.447 --> 30:50.050
That's-- gosh, that's--

30:51.419 --> 30:52.952
that's wow.
[laughs]

30:52.987 --> 30:55.221
How is that even possible?

30:55.255 --> 31:01.361
I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

31:01.395 --> 31:02.562
Huh.

31:02.597 --> 31:04.932
Guess someone's
looking out for me.

31:04.966 --> 31:07.234
I guess so.

31:07.269 --> 31:10.872
Is that yours outside?

31:10.906 --> 31:14.176
Oh, yeah, you know.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.679
Can't be driving a piece of
crap to customer meetings.

31:16.713 --> 31:18.180
You've got to present
that successful image.

31:18.214 --> 31:19.481
Yeah, right, right.

31:19.516 --> 31:23.653
So the IRS stuff--
that's resolved?

31:23.687 --> 31:25.388
Yeah, it's in progress.

31:25.422 --> 31:26.756
So you paid them?

31:26.790 --> 31:28.258
Well, not yet, but I will.

31:29.727 --> 31:30.994
When?

31:31.028 --> 31:34.298
Well, it's not that simple.

31:34.332 --> 31:37.067
Um, here's the thing.

31:37.101 --> 31:39.302
I never had
proper legal counsel,

31:39.337 --> 31:40.770
so I was thinking

31:40.805 --> 31:43.640
I should hire someone good

31:43.674 --> 31:44.974
who can maybe hammer out
a better deal.

31:45.008 --> 31:48.077
There will never be
a better deal, Ted.

31:48.111 --> 31:50.645
The deal is you pay
your back taxes,

31:50.680 --> 31:51.847
you pay your penalty,

31:51.881 --> 31:53.781
and you don't go to prison.

31:53.816 --> 31:55.249
That's a good deal,

31:55.283 --> 31:58.686
so let's keep our priorities
straight here, right?

31:58.720 --> 32:03.924
Well, my priority
is getting my business back

32:03.958 --> 32:05.726
and putting my employees
back on the payroll

32:05.760 --> 32:08.529
so they can pay
their mortgages.

32:08.563 --> 32:12.198
Right, but I think
your employees would agree

32:12.233 --> 32:15.335
that you need to get your
financial situation in control

32:15.369 --> 32:16.603
before you can help them.

32:17.638 --> 32:20.373
Boy, IRS got you on commission?

32:20.408 --> 32:22.509
No, I'm just saying that,
though I really do--

32:22.544 --> 32:26.113
I understand the temptation
to restart the business,

32:26.147 --> 32:27.448
maybe the universe
is telling you

32:27.482 --> 32:30.384
that you need
to pay what you owe.

32:33.555 --> 32:36.257
Skyler, this is my money...

32:40.162 --> 32:41.529
and why are we having
this conversation?

32:41.563 --> 32:43.497
You're no longer
a part of my life--

32:43.532 --> 32:47.234
a decision you made,
by the way--

32:47.268 --> 32:49.869
so I don't understand why
you're hectoring me about this.

32:51.906 --> 32:53.372
Ted, this affects both of us.

32:53.407 --> 32:54.673
No, it doesn't.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.141
I'm telling you,
you need to drop this.

32:56.176 --> 32:59.044
You need to use that money
to pay your bill

32:59.079 --> 33:00.679
by the end of this month,

33:00.714 --> 33:02.515
which you promised the IRS,
in writing,

33:02.549 --> 33:03.849
that you would do.

33:03.883 --> 33:06.085
It is that simple.

33:07.921 --> 33:09.088
Okay.

33:10.791 --> 33:12.359
Okay, duly noted.

33:12.393 --> 33:14.061
What does that mean?

33:14.095 --> 33:17.197
Does that mean yes?
Because I really need a yes here, Ted.

33:17.232 --> 33:20.000
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means.

33:20.034 --> 33:22.836
It means, in the most
respectful way possible,

33:22.870 --> 33:24.104
there's the door,

33:24.138 --> 33:26.773
and I'm inviting you to,
you know--

33:26.808 --> 33:28.542
and thank you for your concern,

33:28.576 --> 33:30.210
but I'm done talking
about this.

33:47.761 --> 33:49.295
[clicks pen]

33:49.329 --> 33:50.696
[writing]

33:58.805 --> 34:03.241
From whom exactly do you think you got
that 600,000, Ted?

34:05.578 --> 34:07.278
Great-aunt Birgit?

34:09.281 --> 34:10.447
That was you?

34:12.217 --> 34:13.384
<i>Ja.</i>

34:17.199 --> 34:18.734
[water trickling]

34:48.197 --> 34:49.732
[sighs]

34:49.766 --> 34:52.400
What is this shit?

34:52.435 --> 34:53.601
What, I don't get a vote?

34:53.963 --> 34:56.031
I'm supposed to just stay
down here forever?

34:58.168 --> 34:59.668
I promise you this--

35:00.871 --> 35:03.640
either we're all going home,
or none of us are.

35:05.642 --> 35:06.976
Now settle down.

35:12.616 --> 35:14.250
On your feet.

35:56.629 --> 35:57.963
[speaks Spanish]

36:12.845 --> 36:13.978
Gustavo.

36:14.013 --> 36:15.580
[speaking Spanish]

36:33.967 --> 36:35.568
[Gus]
This is your new employer.

36:35.602 --> 36:37.936
You address him as Don Eladio.

36:37.971 --> 36:39.405
It's a term of respect.
