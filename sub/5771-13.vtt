07:11.999 --> 07:13.834
OKAY, THAT'S THE OLD CASEY.
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.869
YOU SAID, "PICK SOMETHING
AND STICK WITH IT."

07:15.903 --> 07:19.807
SO I DID, AND GUESS WHAT.
I GOT A HOUSE ON THE BEACH NOW.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.042
WAIT.
WAIT, WHAT?

07:22.075 --> 07:23.043
UH-HUH.
SERIOUSLY?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.211
YEAH.
LIKE WITH A MORTGAGE?

07:24.244 --> 07:25.713
YUP. IT'S INSANE.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.582
THE SEALS WILL SWIM UP
TO MY BEDROOM WINDOW

07:28.616 --> 07:31.485
AND GO, "HEY, YO, CASEY,
IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP, DOG.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.886
[laughs]
LATER."

07:32.920 --> 07:34.955
ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE LIKE...
[barking like a seal]

07:34.988 --> 07:35.789
AND IT'S REALLY ANNOYING.
[laughs]

07:35.823 --> 07:37.691
WHATEVER,
IT'S A BEACH HOUSE PROBLEM.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.892
GOD, YOU EVEN LOOK TALLER.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.494
I AM TALLER.
WHAT?

07:40.528 --> 07:42.963
I HAD AN ADULT-ONSET
GROWTH SPURT.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.499
I--THE DOCTOR SAID IT'S RARE,
BUT I GUESS IT CAN HAPPEN

07:45.533 --> 07:47.000
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE
REALLY HAPPY.

07:47.034 --> 07:47.935
YOU'RE REALLY HAPPY NOW.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.970
I GOTTA SAY YEAH, I AM.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.773
WELL, I'M ACTUALLY
SEEING SOMEBODY.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.577
OKAY, I HAD A BUNCH
OF AFTER-YOU HOOKUPS MYSELF.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.012
I MEAN, A DANGEROUS AMOUNT,
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY

07:59.046 --> 08:00.147
BE MORE CAREFUL,
GET TESTED AND STUFF.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.949
THIS IS A REAL GUY.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.851
OH.
IT'S A REAL THING.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.952
WE'RE MOVING IN TOGETHER.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.788
REALLY?
THE MOVE IN?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.890
OH, IS IT, UM,
THE GUY YOU WORK WITH?

08:09.923 --> 08:11.825
SORT OF HANDSOME?

08:11.859 --> 08:12.826
MORGAN?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.595
ARE YOU INSANE?

08:14.628 --> 08:15.596
[laughs] YOU TWO--
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

08:15.629 --> 08:16.964
WHAT?
NO, HE'S A HOT LAWYER

08:16.997 --> 08:18.131
NAMED CLIFF.
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.267
HOT LAWYER, CLIFF,
I'M VERY EXCITED FOR YOU.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.201
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TONIGHT?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.571
DOPE FEET'S THROWING
THIS, LIKE, POOL PARTY.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.738
WE'RE LAUNCHING
A NEW LINE OF SHOES.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.307
THEY'RE UGLY, BUT ON PURPOSE.
IT'S CRAZY.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.009
YOU GOTTA ROLL THROUGH.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.044
WOW, HOLLYWOOD POOL PARTY?
YEAH.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.981
THAT SOUNDS FUN.
YEAH.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.916
I SHOULDN'T GO, THOUGH.
WHAT?

08:35.949 --> 08:36.850
I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
GO OVER MY NOTES

08:36.884 --> 08:39.019
FROM THIS REALLY INTERESTING
COURSE I TOOK

08:39.052 --> 08:41.021
ON VAGINAL REJUVENATION
FOR THE OBESE.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.990
OKAY,
THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE,

08:43.023 --> 08:44.858
BUT IF YOU DECIDE
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND,

08:44.892 --> 08:46.827
THE PASSWORD
TO GET INTO THE PARTY IS,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.662
"I THINK MY FRIEND'S
IN THERE."

08:48.696 --> 08:49.663
[laughs]

08:49.697 --> 08:51.932
[cell phone chimes]

08:56.837 --> 09:00.841
GETTING YOUR PRE-BABY BODY
BACK IS A NIGHTMARE

09:00.874 --> 09:01.909
FOR A LOT OF NEW MOMS.

09:01.942 --> 09:05.913
WE CAUGHT UP WITH NEW MAMACITA
JAMIE-LYNN SIGLER,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.781
WHO INVITED ME TO HER HOME
FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS...

09:07.815 --> 09:09.216
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, PETER.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.284
AND SHE TOLD--
PAT, IS MARIA MENOUNOS HERE?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.921
NO, SHE'S NOT, SHE'S IN HAWAII
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.690
(Pat)
WE TALKED TO JAMIE-LYNN
FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS

09:16.724 --> 09:18.025
ABOUT GETTING HER BODY BACK,
AND YOU KNOW--

09:18.058 --> 09:19.893
PAT, I THINK THERE'S BEEN
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE,

09:19.927 --> 09:21.629
BECAUSE WE--ME AND MARIA HAD,
LIKE, A LITTLE BIT OF A--

09:21.662 --> 09:23.063
DO I COME TO YOUR OFFICE
AND BOTHER YOU?

09:23.096 --> 09:24.765
WHAT? NO, I DON'T--
NO. WE SAW--

09:24.798 --> 09:25.866
I WORK IN NEW YORK.
UGH!

09:25.899 --> 09:27.100
OH, MY GOD.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.637
PAT, COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND JUST GIVE HER THIS, PLEASE?

09:29.670 --> 09:30.871
HE'S GOT A GUN!

09:30.904 --> 09:32.072
I DON'T HAVE A GUN!
[people screaming]

09:32.105 --> 09:33.106
I DON'T HAVE A--
GET ON THE GROUND!

09:33.140 --> 09:34.675
OH, MY GOD!
YOU'RE A MALL COP!

09:34.708 --> 09:35.743
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT!

09:35.776 --> 09:39.146
ALL RIGHT, GOIN' DOWN.
GOIN' DOWN NICE AND SLOW.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.849
(Mindy)
YOU KNOW, PETER, I WASN'T GONNA
GO TO CASEY'S PARTY TONIGHT,

09:41.882 --> 09:43.083
BUT IF IT'LL CHEER YOU UP...

09:43.116 --> 09:46.019
THANKS, MIN.
THIS PARTY IS LEGIT.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.856
THEY HAVE A POOL,
SLIDER BAR.

09:48.889 --> 09:49.923
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

09:49.957 --> 09:51.859
TO EAT A HAMBURGER
WHILE I WAS SUBMERGED IN WATER.

09:51.892 --> 09:52.993
YOU KNOW WHAT THOUGH?
CHECK TO MAKE SURE

09:53.026 --> 09:54.862
THAT IT'S A FULL TOPPINGS BAR...
[phone line trilling]

09:54.895 --> 09:55.863
AND NOT JUST SHRED LED.
MM-HMM.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.631
I'VE BEEN BURNED
ON THAT BEFORE.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.632
(Cliff)
[on phone] HEY, MINDY.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.900
OH!
HEY, CLIFF.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.169
HEY!
YOU WANNA HEAR SOME GREAT NEWS?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.337
MY CO-WORKER CAME OUT
OF THE CLOSET TO HIS WIFE,

10:04.371 --> 10:05.906
AND SHE KICKED HIM OUT.

10:05.939 --> 10:06.974
OH, MY GOD.
IS HE OKAY?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.876
HE'S NEVER BEEN BETTER,
BUT GET THIS.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.811
SHE CAN'T STAND TO LIVE
IN THEIR APARTMENT ANYMORE

10:10.844 --> 10:12.846
BECAUSE OF HOW
ALL THEIR MEMORIES ARE LIES,

10:12.880 --> 10:15.248
SO...
THE APARTMENT'S AVAILABLE.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.852
OH.
OKAY, COOL, COOL.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.889
UM, NOW, IS THIS, SAY--

10:21.922 --> 10:23.691
IS THIS AN APARTMENT
FOR TWO PEOPLE?

10:23.724 --> 10:26.894
OR IS IT FOR ONE PERSON
TO LIVE BY HIMSELF?

10:26.927 --> 10:29.162
I'M--I'M STILL THINKING
ABOUT THAT.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.898
YEAH.
I STILL THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.833
I JUST NEED TO THINK
ABOUT IT SOME MORE, YOU KNOW?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.802
BUT...I'M THINKING HARD.

10:34.835 --> 10:35.936
HMM.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.906
HEY, SO HOW'S L.A.?
HOW'S THE 90210?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.808
DID YOU GET BREAST IMPLANTS?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.175
NOPE, I STILL HAVE
MY NATURAL "Ds."

10:42.209 --> 10:43.977
AH.
OH, BUT SOMETHING REALLY CRAZY

10:44.011 --> 10:44.778
DID HAPPEN.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.113
WHEN PETER AND I
WERE OUT SHOPPING,

10:46.146 --> 10:47.948
GUESS WHO WE RAN INTO?
CASEY.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.182
ISN'T THAT SO RANDOM?

10:49.216 --> 10:52.853
APPARENTLY, HE STARTED THIS
SHOE COMPANY CALLED "DOPE FEET."

10:52.886 --> 10:54.221
[muttering]
"DOPE FEET."

10:54.254 --> 10:56.023
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
ARE YOU MUMBLING SOMETHING?

10:56.056 --> 10:57.825
NO, NO.
WHAT--NO, GO AHEAD.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.292
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT, SWEETHEART.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.794
HE'S WAY TOO TAN RIGHT NOW.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.129
YOU KNOW I LIKE MY MEN
MILKY WHITE.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.465
ALL RIGHT, JUST...
HUMOR ME, OKAY,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.836
AND DON'T HAVE DINNER WITH HIM
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.904
[rock music playing]

11:10.938 --> 11:12.740
WE GOTTA GO TO THIS PARTY.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.908
*

11:14.942 --> 11:16.043
MINDY?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.978
DINNER? NO!

11:18.011 --> 11:22.049
I WOULD NEVER GO TO A RESTAURANT
AND HAVE DINNER WITH HIM.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.083
ARE YOU CRAZED?

11:23.116 --> 11:24.918
OKAY. THANKS.

11:24.952 --> 11:28.121
'KAY. BYE.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.422
WHO DID YOU JUST LIE TO?
WHAT?

11:32.392 --> 11:33.894
(Mindy)
I THINK I KNOW SOMEONE
IN THERE.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.362
[giggles]

11:35.395 --> 11:38.732
(Peter)
OH, MY GOD, THIS PLACE
WAS ON ENTOURAGE.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.267
THE GUYS CAME HERE...

11:40.300 --> 11:42.469
(Mindy and Peter)
AFTER "E" HAD
THAT PREGNANCY SCARE.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.004
HEY, THERE'S CASEY.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.339
HEY.
HEY.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.240
HE WANTS US TO GO OVER THERE.
LET'S GO.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.810
I--WHY DON'T WE TAKE A LAP,
YOU KNOW?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.745
JUST--YOU HANG OUT.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.313
HI.
NO, SORRY.

11:53.346 --> 11:54.848
I'M GONNA GET A DRINK FIRST,

11:54.882 --> 11:57.117
MAYBE GET SOME SLIDERS.
[chomping]

11:57.150 --> 11:58.218
YEAH, OKAY.
WE'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.420
MINDY, YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE A FUN MOM.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.155
I'M GONNA GO SKEEZ
ON SOME MODELS.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.257
HEY, CASEY, WHAT UP, DUDE?
PETER!

12:04.291 --> 12:07.260
(Morgan)
AND NOW, DR. "C," THE BEST PART
OF THE STUDIO TOUR,

12:07.294 --> 12:08.528
OLD WEST TOWN.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.497
HEY, GOT SOMETHING FOR YA.
WHAT?

12:10.530 --> 12:14.067
I STOLE THIS OFF THE TED TURNER

12:14.101 --> 12:15.135
OH.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.870
AH, YOU LOOK
LIKE A MOGUL.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.305
OKAY, THANK YOU, MORGAN.
YAY.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.874
THAT WAS REALLY NICE
OF YOU.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.811
OH, MY GOD, MORGAN,
THAT IS THE WHOREHOUSE

12:23.844 --> 12:26.346
THAT JOHN WAYNE GOT KICKED OUT
OF IN ROOSTER COGBURN.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.316
"HOWDY, PILGRIM."

12:29.349 --> 12:31.785
IS THAT OBAMA?

12:31.819 --> 12:33.320
NO, IT'S JOHN WAYNE.
"HOWDY, PILGRIM."

12:33.353 --> 12:36.056
OH, GOD, YEAH.
IT'S--IT'S REALLY GOOD.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.390
THANKS, AND YOU KNOW WHAT,
THIS IS A LOT OF FUN.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.458
YES, GOOD.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.427
IT'S SO MUCH MORE FUN
THAN SITTING IN THE HOTEL,

12:40.460 --> 12:42.529
HIDING, AVOIDING MY DAD.
THANK YOU.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.297
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
MM-HMM.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.398
WELL, THEN YOU'RE GONNA
REALLY LOVE

12:45.432 --> 12:47.334
THE NEXT EXCURSION
WE HAVE PLANNED.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.303
ARE WE GOING TO THE
CAPTAIN PHILLIPS STUNT SHOW?

12:50.337 --> 12:51.939
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,
IF YOU THINK

12:51.972 --> 12:53.540
I'M GONNA SIT IN THE
SPLASH ZONE, YOU'RE DREAMING.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.008
[laughs]
YOU'RE DREAMING.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.977
YEAH, NO,
I CALLED YOUR DAD,

12:57.010 --> 13:00.013

13:00.047 --> 13:01.448

13:03.250 --> 13:05.986
I JUST DON'T GET IT, MAN.
IT'S SO INSENSITIVE.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.489
HOW DO YOU SERVE SLIDERS
TO PEOPLE LIKE US, YOU KNOW?

13:09.522 --> 13:11.024
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"PEOPLE LIKE US"?

13:11.058 --> 13:13.426
IF YOU TAKE
A NORMAL HAMBURGER,

13:13.460 --> 13:17.264
IT LOOKS LIKE A TINY SLIDER
IN OUR OVERWEIGHT, PUDGY HANDS.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.866
OKAY, WE'RE NOT THE SAME.
WE'RE NOT THE SAME.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.400
I'M LIKE--I'M LIKE AN ANTHILL,
AND YOU'RE LIKE A VOLCANO.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.334
[text alert]

13:23.436 --> 13:24.471
(Kevin)
HEY, MAN,

13:24.504 --> 13:27.074
I THINK I WAS PROFILED
WITH FOOD.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.108
IS THAT MOLD?

13:28.141 --> 13:30.343
COULD BE MOLD.
BREAD'S GOOD THOUGH.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.379
[text alert]

13:35.215 --> 13:36.884
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I'M RIGHT--

13:36.917 --> 13:39.319

13:39.352 --> 13:41.021
(Kevin)

13:41.054 --> 13:42.022
(Mindy)
SHH! EAT YOUR SLIDER.

13:42.055 --> 13:44.624
WHY DID YOU CALL MY DAD?
HOW DID YOU CALL MY DAD?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.259
WELL, I THOUGHT
IT'D BE GOOD FOR YOU,

13:46.293 --> 13:47.594
AND I GOT HIS NUMBER
FROM RICHIE,

13:47.627 --> 13:49.329
'CAUSE RICHIE AND I
ARE IN AN EMAIL CHAIN.

13:49.362 --> 13:53.300
WE TRADE SLOW COOKER RECIPES.
HE MAKES UNBELIEVABLE CARNITAS.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.868
OH, RICHIE PUT YOU UP
TO THIS?

13:56.436 --> 13:57.504
[beep]

13:57.537 --> 13:58.972
IT'S OLD WEST.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.107
HEY, RICHIE,
IT'S YOUR BROTHER, DAN.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.310
DID YOU TELL MORGAN THAT
I SHOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH DAD?

14:03.343 --> 14:04.411
(Danny)
DID YOU PUT HIM UP TO THAT?

14:04.444 --> 14:06.279
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

14:06.313 --> 14:07.414
I'M IN A NIGHTCLUB.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.482
IT'S A TAYLOR LAUTNER
APPRECIATION PARTY.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.884
OKAY, LOOK,

14:10.918 --> 14:12.352
DANNY, YOU GONNA SEE HIM,

14:12.385 --> 14:14.587
STOP PUSHING IT, RICHIE.
STOP PUSHING IT.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.623
I DON'T CARE ABOUT DAD.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.926
I DON'T CARE ABOUT HIM.
HOW MANY TIMES I GOTTA TELL YOU?

14:18.959 --> 14:20.293
DANNY,
IF YOU DON'T CARE SO MUCH,

14:20.327 --> 14:21.294
WHY ARE YOU LETTING IT
RUIN YOUR TRIP?

14:21.328 --> 14:23.964
OKAY, I THINK YOU NEED
TO REFRESH YOUR INBOX.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.232
I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME.
I JUST--

14:25.265 --> 14:27.400
I JUST TRIED A B.L.T.
WITH AVOCADO.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.859
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT'S
MORE PROBABLE.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.494
CASEY JONES

I DON'T KNOW ANY
FAMOUS "CLIFFS." WHATEVER.

17:43.230 --> 17:46.433
NO, IT JUST--HE'S REAL,
BUT WE DON'T LIVE TOGETHER.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.101
I ASKED HIM
TO MOVE IN WITH ME,

17:48.135 --> 17:49.369
AND HE SAID
HE WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.

17:49.402 --> 17:52.439
WHAT? HE HIT YOU
WITH THE "I'LL THINK ABOUT IT,"

17:52.472 --> 17:53.673
AND YOU STOOD FOR THAT?

17:53.706 --> 17:56.309
WE WERE LIVING TOGETHER
IN A TENT IN HAITI,

17:56.343 --> 17:57.677
AND WE HAD BEEN DATING,

17:57.710 --> 17:59.379

I'M SORRY,
