compared to them,

to be an engineer.

to be good at math.

My sister and I actually began
singing when we were babies.

We began to make music
together and record,

"Let's do this band thing.

My full name is Uchechi, and
"Uchechi" means "God's wish."

11:49.793 --> 11:53.213
Both of my parents came to
the United States for college.

very much, like, a double life.

I'm just gonna say
one more thing...

Here we go. Look at this.

18:29.984 --> 18:33.655
People that have technical,
perfect voices like yours,

18:33.697 --> 18:36.741
sometimes their uniqueness
can get lost.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.160
And I think that one
of the things that I feel like

18:39.202 --> 18:42.914
I could help you with is trying
to get inside of your heart

18:42.956 --> 18:44.457
and find the personality

18:44.499 --> 18:47.335
so that you're not getting lost
just in your voice.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.920
You know what I mean? But, yeah.
Yeah.

one more word in there,

and mess up the song after that.

beaten me to it,

This one,
because it matches my jacket.

I'm gonna go green,

you're going to win.

You won. It's the last --
Thanks for playing.

* 'Cause I'm a super girl,

28:50.271 --> 28:53.358
When I started singing,
I auditioned for a talent show

28:53.400 --> 28:55.193
my sophomore year
of high school,

28:55.235 --> 28:57.278
and my teacher was like,
"You know,

28:57.320 --> 28:59.072
you have a little twang
when you talk."

28:59.114 --> 29:00.365
Being from Pennsylvania,
I'm like,

29:00.407 --> 29:02.242
"What are you talking about?"

29:02.283 --> 29:04.619
So he was like,
"Try a Carrie Underwood song."

29:04.661 --> 29:07.455
And as soon as I sang it,
like I could get used to this.

29:07.497 --> 29:10.542
So I just started going to open
mic nights, going to Nashville,

29:10.583 --> 29:12.711
and it all just kind of
fell into place.

29:12.752 --> 29:15.755

and want to perform,

make people feel beautiful

29:35.400 --> 29:37.235

about themselves.

That's a huge song. There's
a lot of big notes in it,

31:26.428 --> 31:28.013
and if you miss
one of those big ones,

31:28.054 --> 31:30.015
it's just kind of takes it away
from the performance.

31:30.056 --> 31:31.266
And I feel like
if you connected

31:31.307 --> 31:32.517
to the lyric
just a little bit more,

31:32.559 --> 31:35.145
the pitch is not
as much of an issue.

But there's an amazing voice

31:36.855 --> 31:38.189

Thank you. Thank you.

your performance,

31:42.068 --> 31:44.529
but I agree you did have
some pitch problems.

Sometimes when you don't
get enough air

31:47.282 --> 31:49.701
in your diaphragm
to help push that out,

different directions sometimes.

32:04.716 --> 32:06.301
is, like, centered
around your vibrato.

in your low register,

the entire time.

doing a record once,

kept being like,

"Stop doing it." I was like,
"I don't know how to stop it.

No, honestly.

37:17.904 --> 37:21.616
That's what makes your
performance more special to me,

37:21.658 --> 37:24.786
because you were
vulnerable enough to say,

at your restaurant?

No. If I remember correctly,
it was a salad.

55:17.984 --> 55:19.778
in this whole competition
right now.

55:19.819 --> 55:21.863
America loves
that kind of a voice.

55:21.905 --> 55:24.199
And I think you're gonna
get, like, a lot of eyes

55:24.240 --> 55:27.702
on you on this show.
You have a lot of raw talent,

55:27.744 --> 55:29.287

than anything else

around as far as on my team

I am rambling now.

55:33.875 --> 55:35.960
I think I caught
your disease.

It's contagious.
Yeah. It happens to people.

* Lord, I was born
a ramblin' man*

I'm in shock.

Niall: I love Noah's voice.
He's got a bit of country.

56:21.673 --> 56:24.050
He's got a bit
of folk Americana.

56:24.092 --> 56:25.427
He could do the pop stuff.

56:25.468 --> 56:27.721
Oh, my God. Could listen
to that voice all day.

56:27.762 --> 56:29.055
There's a lot of big voices
out there,

56:29.097 --> 56:30.890
but none with the grit
and gravel.

56:30.932 --> 56:33.143
He's definitely a standout voice
in the competition.

So happy to get him
on Team Niall.

Sometimes you play this trick
on your fellow coach

56:43.695 --> 56:45.155
and you try and defeat them.

56:45.196 --> 56:48.241
It didn't work on Niall.
He won. Maybe it backfired.

56:48.283 --> 56:51.828
Maybe he was picked because
I played the trick on him.

Hey, John. Sorry to interrupt.

to get the last word in.

how I feel about it.

of all time

Um, I'm gonna get
that man back.

57:40.627 --> 57:43.338
Yes, he rambles, but I feel like
people kind of like it

57:43.380 --> 57:44.547

New Hartford, New York.

58:00.980 --> 58:02.941
My grandparents
introduced me to Motown.

58:02.982 --> 58:04.901
My father introduced me
to country music.

58:04.943 --> 58:07.612
So, I am ultimately
a country artist,

into country,

58:13.201 --> 58:15.120
Both my parents were
in the military,

58:15.161 --> 58:17.247
and that 100%
sparked my interest

58:17.288 --> 58:18.998
to join the military myself.

58:19.040 --> 58:22.752
I served in Afghanistan
from 2012 to 2013.

58:22.794 --> 58:26.297
In Afghanistan, I took a mortar
round over the top of my head

58:26.339 --> 58:32.846
that came up the side of my --
my leg and my arm right here,

58:32.887 --> 58:34.305
and then TBI.

58:34.347 --> 58:36.182
It's a traumatic brain injury.

58:36.224 --> 58:38.852
I don't remember
too much what happened,

58:38.893 --> 58:41.855
but I was awarded
the Purple Heart.

58:41.896 --> 58:43.148
And to watch him grow

58:43.189 --> 58:45.150
and what he has done
for his country,

58:45.191 --> 58:47.318
I mean, it's the greatest
feeling in the world

58:47.360 --> 58:51.114
to be a grandfather
and have a grandson like that.

58:51.156 --> 58:54.200
Being in the military
made me resilient,

58:54.242 --> 58:57.328
and it definitely made me
put things in perspective.

58:57.370 --> 58:59.456
I absolutely love playing music.

The music has been
his dream forever.

Well, you know
what's funny?

When I was listening
to you sing,

01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:25.500
I was thinking he's putting,
like, a country twist

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:27.919
on the way he's executing
some of the Stevie stuff,

01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:29.295
'cause it was
very soulful,

01:00:29.337 --> 01:00:31.589
but it also had, like,
a little twang to it.

01:00:31.631 --> 01:00:34.300
And I was like, "Is he
a country singer singing...?"

You were?

thought that.

turned, it shows a lot

about how incredible of a coach
she's gonna be.

I'm Talakai.

01:03:32.687 --> 01:03:35.565
I am 34, and I'm from
Sacramento, California.

01:03:35.607 --> 01:03:37.650
And no, I'm not related
to John Legend.

01:03:39.444 --> 01:03:42.322
Talakai is my last name
from my Polynesian side.

01:03:42.364 --> 01:03:44.115
I'm actually
a Tongan and Samoan.

01:03:44.157 --> 01:03:47.494
I was raised by my grandparents,
but with their passing,

01:03:47.535 --> 01:03:49.662
I ended up going to foster care.

01:03:49.704 --> 01:03:54.626
* Take my hand
and understand *

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:57.337
I was about 10 years old
when I lost my family

01:03:57.379 --> 01:03:59.631
and my heritage, my culture.

01:03:59.673 --> 01:04:02.092
It was definitely
traumatic for me.

01:04:02.133 --> 01:04:04.511
I've been in about 10 homes.

01:04:04.552 --> 01:04:07.180
I went through physical
and mental abuse.

01:04:07.222 --> 01:04:09.974
Throughout that time,
I would always turn to music,

01:04:10.016 --> 01:04:12.727
and that helped me
through those dark times.

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:15.522
I remember the first time
that I actually performed

01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:17.565
was for a talent show
in high school.

01:04:17.607 --> 01:04:22.612
I ended up doing really good,
but I ended up not making curfew

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:27.117
and unfortunately, I got
kicked out of my foster home.

01:04:27.158 --> 01:04:28.743
I had to call a friend of mine

01:04:28.785 --> 01:04:31.538
and I asked his mom if I could
come and spend the night.

01:04:31.579 --> 01:04:33.998
Oh, bye. I'm gonna be
cheering for you.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.336
That was the start of our --
our lives together.

01:04:38.378 --> 01:04:41.214
He was friends with my son that
went to the same high school,

01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:44.676
and he was always part of
what was going on at our house.

01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:47.512
So, we never went back
to that family

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:49.931
and he just became
part of ours.

01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:51.516
She ended up adopting me.

01:04:51.558 --> 01:04:53.351
Her support changed me

01:04:53.393 --> 01:04:55.645
by showing me
I was worthy of love.

01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:57.397
I'm so excited
for you.

01:04:57.439 --> 01:04:59.399
I feel lucky to be
part of his life.

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:01.776
I feel lucky
to be his mom.

01:05:01.818 --> 01:05:05.405
I don't have the most
extensive background

01:05:05.447 --> 01:05:06.948
with doing a lot of shows,

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.242
so got a little bit of nerves,
but I'm excited.

01:05:09.284 --> 01:05:12.412
Today I'm gonna be singing
Sam Smith's "Stay With Me."

01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:14.497
Those words
hit different for me.

01:05:14.539 --> 01:05:15.957
I always had that mentality,

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:18.877
wanting a home
and knowing it'll never work.

01:05:18.918 --> 01:05:21.212
Man: Our next artist
is entering now.

01:05:21.254 --> 01:05:23.089
So, walking onto that stage,

01:05:23.131 --> 01:05:24.924
I'll be thinking
about my family.

01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:27.427
And to someone that's
in the foster care system --

01:05:27.469 --> 01:05:30.055
Keep strong.
Believe in yourself.

this beautiful little studio
called Glassnote Productions,

my own studio

to write my own music,

as an engineer and producer.

01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:14.397
I was very impressed
with your performance.

01:20:14.439 --> 01:20:16.274
And when I was looking
the other way,

01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:18.568
you really convinced me
you meant that.

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:22.030
You're very persuasive
when you're singing.

01:20:22.072 --> 01:20:23.656
And I love
a story song.

01:20:23.698 --> 01:20:27.702
I love a song that when I listen
to it, it touches my heart.

01:20:27.744 --> 01:20:30.538
And you're a great singer,
and you touched my heart.

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.374
That's a true gift,
and you have it.

01:20:32.415 --> 01:20:34.709
Thank you so much.
Congratulations on that.

01:20:34.751 --> 01:20:37.587
I think I'm dreaming!
Well, Rudi, I'm Gwen.

01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:40.924
Oh, I know who you are, girl.
I know who you are!

01:20:40.965 --> 01:20:45.261
It's really amazing to hear
someone that is so in control.

01:20:45.303 --> 01:20:47.097
And then on top of it,
I was so blessed

01:20:47.138 --> 01:20:50.600
that I turned around quickly
because of my great instinct,

01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:51.935
because I got
to see you, too.

01:20:51.976 --> 01:20:53.687
And you really know
how to work the stage

01:20:53.728 --> 01:20:56.481
and you've got amazing style
and you're gorgeous.

01:20:56.523 --> 01:20:58.733
And I think I need
to be your coach.

01:20:58.775 --> 01:21:00.944
Like, don't you think that me
and you could, like,

01:21:00.985 --> 01:21:03.029
rule the world?
Rudi: I mean, I'm not gonna lie.

01:21:03.071 --> 01:21:05.031
I'm literally
such a huge fan of yours.

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:07.742
Tell me, like, a little bit
about what music you like.

01:21:07.784 --> 01:21:10.453
So, I'm a musician --
obviously, I'm here --

01:21:10.495 --> 01:21:12.664
but I was not making
a lot of money,

01:21:12.706 --> 01:21:14.708
so I literally needed
to just go back home

01:21:14.749 --> 01:21:17.377
and work at my dad's
auto body shop, so...

01:21:17.419 --> 01:21:18.503
Oh, my God!

01:21:18.545 --> 01:21:20.088
I can clean your car
if you need.

01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:21.965
Just kidding. I don't want
to do that. That's why I'm here.

01:21:22.007 --> 01:21:24.300
Gwen: I lived with my parents
till I was 26,

01:21:24.342 --> 01:21:27.971
and I was in No Doubt nine years
before we got on the radio,

01:21:28.013 --> 01:21:29.514
so I relate to that.

01:21:29.556 --> 01:21:32.475
I just think it's amazing that
you're already so far along.

01:21:32.517 --> 01:21:35.061
I feel like there's things that
we can learn from each other,

01:21:35.103 --> 01:21:36.396
so pick me!

01:21:36.438 --> 01:21:38.314
Rudi: Thank you, Gwen.
Thank you so much.

01:21:38.356 --> 01:21:40.025
Niall: Hello, Rudi.
Oh, my gosh. Hi.

01:21:40.066 --> 01:21:42.944
God, that was so good.
I was just trying to block John,

01:21:42.986 --> 01:21:44.779
so I was just waiting
for as long as I could.

01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:46.489
I'm so proud of you
right now.

01:21:46.531 --> 01:21:47.991
Literally so proud.
He's already gotten me.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:50.326
And to think -- And to think
it will all be for naught.

01:21:50.368 --> 01:21:51.703
That's what's sad about it.

01:21:51.745 --> 01:21:53.329
You're obviously
a big fan of Gwen.

01:21:53.371 --> 01:21:55.373
I just want to let you know
that that was just insane.

01:21:55.415 --> 01:21:57.834
I mean, the fact, you know,
you got a four-chair turn,

01:21:57.876 --> 01:21:59.753
and they're
for special singers.

01:21:59.794 --> 01:22:01.629
It was such a good song choice
for you.

01:22:01.671 --> 01:22:03.506
Oh, thank you so much.
Niall: Now that we can see,

01:22:03.548 --> 01:22:05.008
you already look like
a little star,

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:07.469
and you're gonna go
all the way, in my eyes.

01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:10.597
It would be a dream, you know,
to work with a voice like that.

01:22:10.638 --> 01:22:13.183
Thank you so much.
Oh, my God.

01:22:13.224 --> 01:22:16.394
I'm so sad I was deprived
of the opportunity

01:22:16.436 --> 01:22:18.688
to have you
on my team.

01:22:18.730 --> 01:22:20.398
I would never
do it to him.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.858
No, no.
He'd never do that to me.

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:24.527
I would never -- I really think
you should not pick him,

01:22:24.569 --> 01:22:25.820
is all I have to say.

01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:27.364
[ Laughter ]

01:22:27.405 --> 01:22:28.907
I'm also sad I've used
my block, though,

01:22:28.948 --> 01:22:30.950
'cause she just looked
at Gwen.

01:22:30.992 --> 01:22:33.370
Well, we are locking eyes
this whole time.

01:22:33.411 --> 01:22:35.580
I mean, it's crazy, and I know
that you really want this.

01:22:35.622 --> 01:22:37.832
Look, look.
[ Laughter ]

01:22:37.874 --> 01:22:40.794
I don't want Niall to get
the last word, whatever we do.

01:22:40.835 --> 01:22:42.962
So I'm gonna ask
the question now

01:22:43.004 --> 01:22:44.589
so that you can
pick Gwen.

01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:47.300
Oh, yay!
I got an endorsement.
Hey!

01:22:47.342 --> 01:22:49.636
Rudi, who do you pick
as your coach?

Come on, Rudi!
Come home to me...Mama!

01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:00.438
Oh, my God.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.940
Come on!

01:23:01.981 --> 01:23:03.775
Thank you guys, again,
so much, seriously.

01:23:03.817 --> 01:23:06.444
This is not even registering in
my brain, what's going on.

01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:11.199
Um, but I think
I'm gonna have to go...

01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:12.409
with my girl Gwen.

01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:14.911
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:23:14.953 --> 01:23:17.539
Let's go! Yes!

[ Laughs ]

01:23:18.832 --> 01:23:21.918
I got a good one!
I got such a good one!

01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:24.004
That's another
four-chair for me.

01:23:24.045 --> 01:23:25.213
Hello!

01:23:25.255 --> 01:23:26.673
Rudi is so amazing.

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:28.758
She's a full package deal.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.135
Wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow!

01:23:30.176 --> 01:23:31.177
You're so beautiful.

01:23:31.219 --> 01:23:32.721
This is so cool.

01:23:32.762 --> 01:23:34.723
Gwen: I'm getting excited
to pick songs

01:23:34.764 --> 01:23:36.182
and take it to the next level.

01:23:36.224 --> 01:23:37.517
What a waste!

01:23:37.559 --> 01:23:39.019
Niall: I knew
John was gonna go for it,

01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:41.771
so I was literally sat
looking down the line.

01:23:41.813 --> 01:23:44.899
Got him.
And then it didn't work out.

01:23:44.941 --> 01:23:47.652
You get one per season.
What a waste!

01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:50.947
Listen, Niall had some
beginner's luck last season,

01:23:50.989 --> 01:23:53.241
but I think he still has
a lot to learn.

01:23:53.283 --> 01:23:56.703
I lost big-time to Gwen Stefani,
but I'm glad I got John.

01:23:56.745 --> 01:23:59.831
That was really great.
90 seconds like this.

01:23:59.873 --> 01:24:01.708
Put my hand over John's.
Yeah.

01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:03.043
And what a waste of time
that was.

01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:05.170
What a waste of a block.
I love it.
