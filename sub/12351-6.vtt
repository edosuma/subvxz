WEBVTT

00:02.028 --> 00:04.486
- I'm looking for a new job.
- "Part-time cater-waiters."

00:04.656 --> 00:06.942
Lana. What's it take for
a guy to get your number?

00:07.067 --> 00:09.032
The staff phone sheet.
Too bad you quit.

00:09.202 --> 00:10.896
Do you think you
could trust him again?

00:11.079 --> 00:12.350
I think I want to try.

00:12.539 --> 00:14.454
I used to have so much fun with you.

00:14.624 --> 00:16.190
Whenever I'm around you, it just

00:16.323 --> 00:19.057
reminds me of all the bad crap
I did to you

00:19.182 --> 00:20.877
I'm not used to
giving second chances.

00:21.047 --> 00:22.270
And you won't regret it.

00:22.395 --> 00:25.089
She's back with fisher
and i'm still in the doghouse?

00:25.260 --> 00:26.765
Jordan seems a little down.

00:26.970 --> 00:29.149
I don't think she's
very excited about school.

00:38.933 --> 00:41.046
Can you help me carry some stuff in?

00:41.247 --> 00:42.274
Of course.

00:43.812 --> 00:44.818
Let me get that.

00:47.482 --> 00:48.492
Awesome.

00:53.379 --> 00:54.161
Got it.

00:54.707 --> 00:56.246
Look like you need some help.

00:56.993 --> 00:58.582
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no problem.

00:59.374 --> 01:01.110
Flowers, muffins,

01:01.235 --> 01:03.408
and a map of the us?
OK, let me guess.

01:03.533 --> 01:04.688
You are...

01:04.822 --> 01:07.456
...having a giant
geography tea party?

01:07.635 --> 01:09.648
Worse. It's ZBZ founder's weekend.

01:09.777 --> 01:12.364
You know, that special time
of year where former cru ZBZS

01:12.557 --> 01:15.807
come from far and wide return to their
alma mater to wax nostalgic about

01:15.977 --> 01:17.290
our shared history

01:17.591 --> 01:20.117
and sing multiple bonding songs.

01:20.315 --> 01:22.435
And get hit up for cash
on their way out the door.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.155
The joys of sisterhood.

01:24.962 --> 01:27.521
Laura? Could you,
help me with some more stuff?

01:27.739 --> 01:29.467
You guys really went
all out this year.

01:29.675 --> 01:32.835
Well, we seem to have
been slipping in the

01:33.109 --> 01:34.480
campus rankings a little.

01:34.605 --> 01:36.912
What? That's crazy.
I hadn't heard anything about that.

01:39.054 --> 01:42.493
- I hate that I know when you're lying.
- Sorry. So how bad is it?

01:43.132 --> 01:44.586
Fourth... Ish.

01:45.405 --> 01:48.147
So we're hoping to bring
in some extra cash to

01:48.685 --> 01:51.480
help with some bigger
mixers and socials.

01:51.971 --> 01:54.377
You know.
Money certainly doesn't hurt, right?

01:54.785 --> 01:56.698
- Sounds familiar.
- Anyway,

01:56.966 --> 01:58.405
Ashleigh and I are

01:58.530 --> 02:01.519
committed to leaving ZBZ
the way we found it: back on top.

02:01.644 --> 02:04.196
Well, if there's anything
the Omega Chis can do to help out...

02:04.401 --> 02:05.354
Thanks.

02:06.663 --> 02:08.876
I can't believe
you knew about fourth-ish.

02:09.001 --> 02:11.946
It's getting harder and harder
keeping secrets on this campus, right?

02:12.193 --> 02:13.203
I guess...

02:14.054 --> 02:16.136
Watch where you're going,
Evan keller!

02:16.261 --> 02:18.936
You watch where you're going,
Cappie... Keller.

02:22.581 --> 02:24.596
Really gotta come up with
some snappier comebacks.

02:24.721 --> 02:28.213
Or maybe you two'll just disengage from this
pissing contest and actually become friends again.

02:28.972 --> 02:30.580
Yeah, like that'll ever happen.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.556
So we're definitely on for operation:
secret double date tonight?

02:35.681 --> 02:37.758
Jordan and I can't wait
to finally meet grant.

02:37.883 --> 02:40.700
You know, I've never gone out with
any of your boyfriends before.

02:41.141 --> 02:43.812
- That came out wrong.
- Does Dale want to join us?

02:44.148 --> 02:46.606
He turned in all his work early
and went home for the weekend.

02:47.097 --> 02:49.704
His parents flew him home after
he told them he was an atheist.

02:49.829 --> 02:53.363
He said they totally accepted his newfound
belief that there's no point to existence.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.358
Ambush?

02:54.617 --> 02:56.769
Personally,
I think they're gonna crucify him.

02:56.898 --> 02:59.976
Ladies and Gentlemen,
let's prepare to dive

03:00.526 --> 03:04.038
headfirst into our innermost id

03:04.377 --> 03:06.976
as we roam over the lascivious

03:07.101 --> 03:09.728
paint strokes
of artists who conspire

03:09.853 --> 03:13.852
to arouse our beings
in undeniable pleasure.

03:14.129 --> 03:16.812
Thirty seconds into class
and I'm already creeped out.

03:17.015 --> 03:18.932
- A new record.
- What's wrong?

03:19.418 --> 03:20.765
- Jordan's not here.
- So

03:21.067 --> 03:23.891
let's complete the journey through
the eroticism of modernism

03:24.397 --> 03:26.931
with the final two presentations.

03:27.357 --> 03:29.516
Reed and Rutherford.

03:29.641 --> 03:31.787
Starting with Ms. Reed.

03:32.283 --> 03:33.479
This is bad.

03:34.161 --> 03:35.425
Jordan Reed?

03:40.180 --> 03:41.328
Ms. Reed?

03:41.543 --> 03:44.039
No, I'm Rusty.
Her boyfriend.

03:44.852 --> 03:46.851
I think she's just
running a little late.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.090
Art does not wait.

03:49.864 --> 03:51.072
Neither do i.

03:51.257 --> 03:53.279
If we can just wait five minutes...

03:53.468 --> 03:54.557
In five minutes,

03:54.682 --> 03:58.428
she will get the same grade
i'm giving her now.

04:17.942 --> 04:20.434
Aren't we overdoing
it on kitty spirit?

04:20.728 --> 04:23.120
Each cat represents a year
of ZBZ's history

04:23.245 --> 04:25.268
as well as a great way
to change conversation

04:25.393 --> 04:29.393
should any of our alumnae ask
about our recent downturn on campus.

04:31.489 --> 04:33.760
You really think we shouldn't
tell them we're fourth-ish?

04:33.885 --> 04:36.015
Cause we could really use
their help now more than ever.

04:36.140 --> 04:40.009
And run the risk of them thinking
we're responsible? Not a chance.

04:40.385 --> 04:42.298
This weekend is all about charm,

04:42.476 --> 04:44.695
flattery and shameless butt-kissing.

04:44.878 --> 04:47.405
Right. And I'm keeping
my sights on Doris Mcgovern,

04:47.530 --> 04:50.320
class of 1966 and our wealthiest alumna.

04:50.445 --> 04:52.166
I've spent the last week
researching her.

04:52.308 --> 04:55.645
She could single-handedly
fund next year's entire rush.

04:55.918 --> 04:57.554
In one year, ZBZ could be back on top.

04:58.602 --> 04:59.911
Isn't that right?

05:01.413 --> 05:03.738
About the cats...
Well, I'm

05:03.956 --> 05:07.278
worried one day you'll end up surrounded
by dozens of them in

05:07.403 --> 05:10.267
a small apartment with newspapers
stacked against the door.

05:10.737 --> 05:13.047
Sorry, it's just,
you have no real social life anymore.

05:13.172 --> 05:15.218
Fisher's been trying to set you
up with some of his friends...

05:15.348 --> 05:18.494
Between pan-hellenic, the pledges,
my classes and this house,

05:18.619 --> 05:20.150
I have too much on my plate already.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.807
Why can't you have more than one plate?
You could have two plates,

05:22.932 --> 05:25.290
- maybe a chafing dish?
- No time to chafe.

05:25.460 --> 05:29.337
This weekend I have one job, and that's
to keep my attention on Doris Mcgovern.

05:33.218 --> 05:36.221
And her stupid hot grandson.

05:46.085 --> 05:47.267
There you are.

05:47.396 --> 05:49.708
Here I am.
Here, come check these out.

05:49.848 --> 05:52.025
I took these photos this
morning on main street.

05:52.422 --> 05:55.987
You should've seen the light, it was
all Dusty and diffused. It was perfect.

05:56.344 --> 05:59.626
The light was pretty great in
art history this morning, too.

06:00.555 --> 06:03.265
Gosh, I totally forgot.

06:03.732 --> 06:06.449
Maybe I can talk to professor
summerfield about turning it in late.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.731
It's OK, I took care of it.
After class, I told him

06:08.880 --> 06:11.188
you were involved
in a pretty bad hair dryer accident.

06:11.631 --> 06:15.253
You can return your report in on monday,
?????????????????????

06:15.983 --> 06:17.152
Thank you.

06:19.806 --> 06:22.841
You helped me get into the lab
to do my o-chem extra credit.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.430
- It's the least I can do.
- OK, look at this one.

06:26.312 --> 06:28.023
This one is my favorite.

06:31.619 --> 06:35.093
As soon as I put xavier down for his
nap, then Brianna's up running around.

06:35.218 --> 06:37.581
Then I put her down
and then he's up running around.

06:37.710 --> 06:39.843
I mean, I get so exhausted.

06:39.968 --> 06:43.330
Yeah, I'm exhausted just hearing
about it. Would you excuse me?

06:47.412 --> 06:48.422
Excuse me.

06:52.642 --> 06:53.665
Hello.

06:54.570 --> 06:57.035
- You're talking to me now?
- Just for the weekend.

06:57.160 --> 07:00.084
Remember, this is all about sisterhood.
And their money.

07:00.729 --> 07:02.988
Thanks for the refresher
course on sisterhood, Ash.

07:03.125 --> 07:05.723
Super helpful.
Not to mention hypocritical.

07:06.013 --> 07:07.661
What's that supposed to mean?

07:08.387 --> 07:09.811
How about we start with Fisher?

07:09.996 --> 07:12.272
You've already forgiven him for
something he and I both did.

07:12.442 --> 07:15.969
It's a total double-standard, yet you're
giving me lessons on being good sister.

07:16.094 --> 07:17.643
Because you're the one that started

07:17.768 --> 07:19.863
when you decided to play&tongue
twister with Fisher.

07:20.033 --> 07:22.688
Which makes you the worst sister...
In the whole world.

07:24.262 --> 07:26.435
- You want to put that to a test?
- What kind of a test?

07:26.560 --> 07:27.513
A bet.

07:27.638 --> 07:31.046
The house needs money, so the sister
who raises more money this weekend wins.

07:31.171 --> 07:33.710
And if I do, you have to
give me a second chance, too.

07:34.887 --> 07:38.882
Fine. And if I win, you have to be
sober sister for the rest of the year.

07:39.052 --> 07:42.472
And spend every ZBZ event at the house,
waiting for drunk distress calls?

07:43.668 --> 07:44.668
Super.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.141
Look at the plus side, at least
we'll both know what you're doing.

07:50.732 --> 07:52.729
At least we'll both
know what you're doing.

07:59.071 --> 08:01.650
I want it yesterday I was 15
and now i'm 16.

08:01.824 --> 08:04.858
Isn't that weird?
It's just so weird, right?

08:06.116 --> 08:08.077
Totally weird.
Here's your cake.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.338
Can you get me a different piece?

08:12.946 --> 08:15.043
- What's wrong with this one?
- It's cut weird.

08:23.117 --> 08:25.830
That cake looks delicious.
Did you make that yourself?

08:25.955 --> 08:28.099
Are you warming up to use
that line on a 16 year-old?

08:28.224 --> 08:29.941
'cause it might need a little work.

08:30.066 --> 08:31.957
Please I'm here for the cake,
although I'm more

08:32.082 --> 08:34.303
of a pie man, but we can
discuss that later over drinks.

08:34.428 --> 08:37.188
The only drinks i'm dealing with
later are the ones i'm cleaning up.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.626
Great! Tomorrow night?

08:38.751 --> 08:40.902
You really aren't clear on
the meaning of "no", are you?

08:41.076 --> 08:44.899
No. But I'm very good with yeses, as in:
"yes, I find you insanely hot"

08:45.242 --> 08:47.067
and "yes,
I was hoping you felt the same",

08:47.192 --> 08:49.035
and "yes,
tomorrow night sounds great."

08:49.205 --> 08:51.463
- And what if I still said no?
- No to which "yes"?

08:51.636 --> 08:52.579
The first two.

08:52.726 --> 08:55.711
Then I'll pick you up at eight,
and won't take no for an answer.

08:55.973 --> 08:57.302
No to which "yes?"

09:02.713 --> 09:05.636
- Hey man, is she going out with you?
- I don't know.

09:05.857 --> 09:08.669
So... That was weird, running into
you and casey this morning. Literally.

09:08.864 --> 09:11.596
Yeah. She and I are friends again.

09:11.769 --> 09:13.838
A Psi Phi brownie was involved.

09:14.648 --> 09:17.061
I've heard of their psychedelic
healing powers.

09:17.399 --> 09:18.686
You're OK with that, right?

09:19.380 --> 09:20.695
Yeah, completely.

09:21.458 --> 09:22.536
Friends are fun.

09:23.091 --> 09:24.571
I think plato said that.

09:24.938 --> 09:26.032
Or...

09:26.337 --> 09:27.337
Elmo.

09:28.545 --> 09:31.318
The birthday brat just put in a special
request for you to serve them...

09:31.443 --> 09:33.069
- ...shirtless.
- What?

09:37.378 --> 09:39.912
I'll make you mine, Mrs. Mcgovern,
I just wanted to say how honored

09:40.037 --> 09:43.179
- I am to have you back here at ZBZ.
- Of course you are, dear.

09:44.063 --> 09:45.405
Boy on the floor!

09:46.415 --> 09:48.209
We never bothered to use towels.

09:49.545 --> 09:52.036
Well, with your figure,
you didn't need to.

09:52.620 --> 09:53.620
Right.

09:54.144 --> 09:58.144
So, I bet the study lounge looked
different without the computers.

09:58.483 --> 10:00.969
Are you implying that I'm old?

10:01.234 --> 10:04.626
No, I just wanted to
point out the computers.

10:04.751 --> 10:07.274
That they're a little outdated...

10:07.399 --> 10:09.178
I've always said,
"if it ain't broke."

10:09.303 --> 10:10.620
I always say that, too!

10:10.745 --> 10:13.162
But of course, if it is
broke, it takes money...

10:13.331 --> 10:16.497
Right.
I'm going to find my old room.

10:19.349 --> 10:21.446
She's warm.

10:22.065 --> 10:23.265
A word of advice?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.497
She spends her life
getting hit up for money,

10:25.622 --> 10:26.924
so stop sucking up.

10:27.174 --> 10:28.978
Am I coming across
a little desperate?

10:29.103 --> 10:30.469
A little, yeah.

10:30.594 --> 10:32.388
For what it's worth,
i'm enjoying the tour.

10:32.639 --> 10:34.058
I'm glad to see that someone is.

10:34.227 --> 10:36.038
So what do you think
of the house so far?

10:36.163 --> 10:39.154
Honestly, I'm a little surprised
you girls are such slobs.

10:39.279 --> 10:41.474
You do know you're only
getting the second floor tour

10:41.599 --> 10:43.887
- because you're with doris.
- Yeah, I know.

10:44.012 --> 10:46.354
Traveling with her sometimes
does have its perks.

10:49.359 --> 10:50.941
Don't be nervous.

10:51.066 --> 10:52.782
What if he recognizes me?

10:53.604 --> 10:56.447
He won't. Just trust me,
it was over a year ago.

10:59.095 --> 11:01.431
Grant, this is rusty
and this is jordan.

11:01.556 --> 11:03.806
- Great finally meeting you guys.
- Yeah, absolutely.

11:03.931 --> 11:05.604
I feel like we've met before.

11:06.619 --> 11:08.842
No. Probably not.

11:09.010 --> 11:12.178
So jordan, what happened
to you this morning?

11:12.882 --> 11:14.807
I was taking pictures
on main street.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.321
You should see her pictures.
She is really good.

11:18.508 --> 11:20.322
Are you sure we haven't met?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.737
Are you taking any photography
classes this semester?

11:22.862 --> 11:25.183
No, I've never thought
about taking it in school.

11:25.527 --> 11:28.487
A friend of mine from back home is
a professional photographer in new york.

11:28.656 --> 11:31.144
Twenty-three and she's already
shooting spreads forvogue.

11:32.118 --> 11:33.156
Teen vogue.

11:33.841 --> 11:36.161
If you want, you could call her.

11:36.789 --> 11:39.858
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love
to hear how she got started.

11:40.126 --> 11:42.793
She must be really talented if
she's doing all that just out of school.

11:42.962 --> 11:46.130
Actually, she dropped out and
she got a job as an intern,

11:46.255 --> 11:49.341
paid her dues, and now
she's working on her own.

11:49.716 --> 11:51.759
Really?
I had no idea you could do that.

11:52.032 --> 11:53.536
It's pretty risky though.

11:53.899 --> 11:56.512
Seems like you need a college degree to
do anything these days.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.283
- Not necessarily in the arts.
- Exactly!

11:59.683 --> 12:01.680
She was telling me that...

12:03.299 --> 12:04.148
Stuff.

12:05.308 --> 12:08.152
- School's not for everyone.
- It should be.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.035
You're one of the omega chis

12:11.160 --> 12:13.489
that taped me to the wall last year.

12:16.829 --> 12:19.989
You guys should try this corn bread,
it's really... Fresh.

12:24.124 --> 12:26.674
With our country torn asunder,

12:26.799 --> 12:29.791
it pains me that we are
engaged in battle as well.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.419
<i>You are my sister,
and have betrayed me.</i>

12:34.278 --> 12:35.900
<i>If only a magical wood nymph.</i>

12:36.025 --> 12:37.965
Someone got herself a chafing dish.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.024
- He's really sweet.
- But don't you think it's kinda weird

12:42.149 --> 12:44.746
that doris brought him
to a sority function?

12:44.871 --> 12:46.418
He's the only boy here.

12:46.804 --> 12:48.585
He's helping his grandma out.

12:48.710 --> 12:50.100
I think it's really nice.

12:50.225 --> 12:52.040
<i>An injured wood nymph approaches.</i>

12:52.769 --> 12:56.566
<i>Be calm and quiet so we
do not scare the injured.</i>

13:03.795 --> 13:05.326
Wood nymph?

13:05.451 --> 13:07.906
- Really?
- Come on, it's zbz history.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.167
How's it going with doris?

13:11.292 --> 13:15.272
I've tried professional,
gracious, nonchalant...

13:15.397 --> 13:17.496
But I'm not any closer
than I was with desperate.

13:17.621 --> 13:20.049
Don't give up.
She loved her time here.

13:20.218 --> 13:22.170
That's the problem.
She loves zbz of the past.

13:22.295 --> 13:24.090
Not really zbz of the present.

13:24.347 --> 13:26.809
- So, focus on the past.
- Nostalgia...

13:30.894 --> 13:33.645
We could brainstorm
more later. Grab a drink?

13:34.597 --> 13:38.490
I provided that you ditch the
bayonet and the mustache.

13:39.821 --> 13:41.611
I'm sure I could manage to...

13:41.736 --> 13:43.974
your stupid brother is
waiting for you in the kitchen.

13:46.972 --> 13:48.911
I'm sorry, I have to...

13:49.283 --> 13:51.523
No excuses. It's a soldier's duty.

13:53.752 --> 13:55.987
But what can eugenia and I offer yee.

13:56.112 --> 13:58.842
In return, ensorcelled nymph?

14:01.843 --> 14:03.008
You need a shave.

14:03.271 --> 14:05.845
And you need to stop
eating our food.

14:06.014 --> 14:08.694
What's up? You just interrupted
some serious.

14:08.819 --> 14:10.143
Networking.

14:10.268 --> 14:12.489
It's jordan. Has she talked
to you about school lately?

14:12.614 --> 14:14.199
Like if she's having any problems?

14:14.324 --> 14:16.716
She's mentioned she has
an 8:00am class she hates.

14:16.841 --> 14:18.644
But I mean, who could blame her?

14:18.769 --> 14:20.151
Brains don't work that early.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.777
No, I mean academically.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.924
I just get the feeling
she's not that into school.

14:24.199 --> 14:25.989
Like she doesn't see
the point to any of it.

14:26.209 --> 14:27.927
Yeah, with an 8:00am, who would?

14:28.052 --> 14:30.559
OK, unfortunately, unlike you,

14:30.684 --> 14:32.890
we all didn't know what we
wanted to do when we were born.

14:33.015 --> 14:34.773
Most of us are still
figuring it out.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.048
<i>I said,</i>

14:36.173 --> 14:39.476
"does he not see
how devotedly I love him?"

14:39.601 --> 14:41.367
Crap, that's my cue.

14:41.492 --> 14:43.591
You're saying there's
nothing I can do about it?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.996
Isn't the question "what is
jordan going to do about it?"

14:46.121 --> 14:47.513
What affects jordan affects me.

14:47.638 --> 14:50.723
You love studying polymer
science, what does she have?

14:51.033 --> 14:53.926
I don't know. She's been
really into photography lately.

14:54.145 --> 14:55.599
Then maybe that's her direction.

14:55.724 --> 14:59.157
"Does he not see how
devotedly I love him?"

14:59.817 --> 15:01.698
Sorry, I gotta go storm atlanta.

15:05.974 --> 15:09.262
According to the undergrad catalogue,
all you need is professor belski

15:09.387 --> 15:11.922
to approve your portfolio
and then you're in the major.

15:12.047 --> 15:14.043
- But I don't even have a portfolio.
- Yet.

15:14.632 --> 15:16.822
We'll worry about that
after she agrees to look at it.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.190
Thank you for doing this for me.

15:20.429 --> 15:22.326
You can thank me if it works.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.966
Hi, professor belski...

15:30.264 --> 15:31.781
What do you think of this?

15:32.432 --> 15:33.432
It's an eye?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.439
They say that eyes are
the windows to the soul.

15:35.564 --> 15:38.272
But windows are clear, transparent,
merely a framing device.

15:38.397 --> 15:41.282
So what does a well-exposed
close-up of an eye,

15:41.407 --> 15:43.452
a frame within a frame, mean?

15:45.762 --> 15:48.575
Nothing? If there's no context.

15:48.700 --> 15:50.406
Exactly.

15:50.531 --> 15:52.037
What's your name?

15:52.767 --> 15:53.828
Jordan reed.

15:54.174 --> 15:57.329
I'm actually interested in majoring in
photography and I was wondering...

15:57.454 --> 16:00.002
We're wondering if you could
take a look at her portfolio.

16:01.847 --> 16:03.724
May you take a look
at her portfolio?

16:03.849 --> 16:07.541
The month. I look at portfolios
the month of may for next fall.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.692
I was hoping to start
sooner than that.

16:09.817 --> 16:11.540
Do you think you could
make an exception?

16:11.665 --> 16:13.582
May. No exceptions.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.427
And no eyeballs, please.

16:19.656 --> 16:21.387
May isn't that far away.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.119
But the program doesn't
start'til next fall.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.811
And that's if I even get in.

16:25.936 --> 16:27.554
What if she doesn't
like my pictures?

16:27.949 --> 16:30.015
She'll love them.
You just have to wait.

16:30.140 --> 16:31.888
Another year?

16:35.818 --> 16:38.025
We used to roast marshmallows here

16:38.150 --> 16:40.457
but the cost of cleaning
the chimney became too great.

16:41.242 --> 16:43.553
My kids love to roast marshmallows.

16:43.678 --> 16:45.139
They're six and four.

16:45.264 --> 16:46.812
It's the first time I've been away.

16:47.949 --> 16:50.039
- You must really Miss them.
- What?

16:50.164 --> 16:51.815
My kids, sure.

16:53.743 --> 16:55.357
But I Miss this house.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.100
And the sisters, and the gossip...

16:58.268 --> 17:00.247
Come on, gimme some gossip.

17:02.553 --> 17:04.541
Caroline is failing german.

17:04.666 --> 17:07.415
And jamie wears invisible braces.

17:08.429 --> 17:10.445
Come on, give me some real dirt.

17:10.741 --> 17:11.821
I won't tell.

17:17.613 --> 17:19.224
See that girl over there?

17:19.349 --> 17:21.703
She kissed my boyfriend
at a kt party.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.240
You're hanging out with kts?

17:26.138 --> 17:28.003
B: what a skank!

17:28.471 --> 17:30.983
Yeah. We're in a bet.

17:31.268 --> 17:34.314
And if she raises more money than me,
I actually have to forgive her.

17:35.796 --> 17:37.710
I just don't know what I can do.

17:38.835 --> 17:41.050
We can make damn
sure she doesn't win.

17:41.175 --> 17:42.795
Hand me my purse.

17:47.698 --> 17:49.429
Are there always this
many people here?

17:49.554 --> 17:52.304
This is a slow night. You go for
a table and i'll get us some drinks.

17:52.429 --> 17:54.185
But I was hoping to treat.

17:54.547 --> 17:57.702
Girls get served way faster
than guys. So, this one's on me.

18:00.384 --> 18:02.214
<i>- Two drafts please.
- You got it.</i>

18:02.339 --> 18:03.730
Girls always get served faster.

18:04.002 --> 18:05.620
It's probably because of the boobs.

18:06.235 --> 18:08.057
Do you want me to get you one?

18:08.298 --> 18:09.630
Two, actually.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.508
I just saw these
girls in pink sweaters

18:13.797 --> 18:16.411
almost throw down over
an empty bathroom stall.

18:18.563 --> 18:19.764
Hey, I'm lana.

18:19.934 --> 18:21.100
I'm casey.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.687
So... How do you
two know each other?

18:25.942 --> 18:28.189
Fight club. Damn.
I broke the first rule.

18:28.481 --> 18:30.020
And the second one.

18:31.408 --> 18:33.172
Do you know each other from class?

18:33.297 --> 18:34.821
I don't go to school here.

18:35.045 --> 18:36.407
Where do you go?

18:36.762 --> 18:38.450
To work. That's about it.

18:41.864 --> 18:44.159
<i>- Here you go.
- You look thirsty.</i>

18:44.451 --> 18:45.551
No.

18:46.227 --> 18:49.005
I'm here with... nate.
He's this guy...

18:49.130 --> 18:51.046
That I'm seeing. He's over there.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.845
<i>He got a table. He's a keeper.</i>

18:56.194 --> 18:57.571
Does he share?

18:58.886 --> 19:00.555
Do you want to join us?

19:03.310 --> 19:04.970
Sure, yeah.

19:13.215 --> 19:15.241
Nate, this is lana.

19:15.366 --> 19:16.739
<i>And cappie.</i>

19:17.636 --> 19:19.241
That's a funny name.

19:19.597 --> 19:21.301
Yeah, it makes me laugh, too.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.271
So how do you two know each other?

19:23.539 --> 19:26.678
We just met actually.
At zbz founder's weekend.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.149
Funny. You look awfully young
and male to have founded zbz.

19:30.338 --> 19:34.069
No, he's accompanying his
grandmother. Isn't that sweet?

19:34.258 --> 19:36.591
Actually,
doris is not my grandmother.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.177
She's not?

19:38.542 --> 19:40.350
No, I'm more of her helper.

19:40.475 --> 19:42.254
Her helperish friend.

19:42.599 --> 19:45.226
What does a helperish friend do?

19:45.405 --> 19:47.734
Other than make great
meals out of hamburger?

19:49.216 --> 19:51.457
When doris's husband died,

19:51.582 --> 19:53.849
she had to run
the company by herself,

19:54.202 --> 19:55.930
and she needed
an extra set of hands.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.838
And what exactly do those hands do?

19:58.032 --> 19:59.739
They help, OK?

19:59.947 --> 20:02.910
I think taking care of the
elderly is a wonderful thing.

20:03.121 --> 20:04.794
Sure. Helping is great.

20:04.919 --> 20:07.970
I think elmo said that. Or plato.

20:09.725 --> 20:12.610
So what kind of name
is cappie? Dutch?

20:27.103 --> 20:30.452
After all this work, I really feel like
I've "urned" this wine.

20:31.461 --> 20:33.642
- That's funny, right.
- No.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.334
- So I was with casey last night...
- Really?

20:36.503 --> 20:39.012
- You guys hung out?
- Yeah.

20:39.461 --> 20:43.201
She was with this guy, nate.
Something's not right with him.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.728
Not to mention i'm 99 percent sure
he lifted a tip off the table.

20:45.853 --> 20:47.190
Why didn't you say something?

20:47.315 --> 20:49.324
I can't. She'll just accuse
me of being jealous.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.880
- Are you?
- No. I want her to move on.

20:52.005 --> 20:54.155
- Just not with a douche bag.
- Right.

20:54.960 --> 20:58.258
But... Someone could talk to her.

20:58.602 --> 21:00.013
A friend?

21:00.550 --> 21:03.236
Yeah, all right.
I'll warn casey off your douche bigalow.

21:03.572 --> 21:05.078
"Douche bigalow", that's funny.

21:05.203 --> 21:07.370
- I must be wearing off on you.
- That's what he said.

21:07.495 --> 21:08.743
The streak ends at one.

21:09.087 --> 21:10.968
- So, you'll talk to casey?
- Yes.

21:11.663 --> 21:13.451
Just one question.

21:13.576 --> 21:15.915
How am I supposed to warn her
about somebody I've never met?

21:17.753 --> 21:19.283
If I don't do something soon,

21:19.408 --> 21:21.465
I have a feeling jordan
might leave school.

21:21.590 --> 21:22.853
So what if she does?

21:22.978 --> 21:25.306
It's possible that college
might not be right for her.

21:25.431 --> 21:27.888
She would be making a
massive mistake if she quit.

21:28.013 --> 21:31.012
- And I have to stop that.
- What does that mean?

21:31.137 --> 21:33.329
It means you should drop
your jacket back at the house,

21:33.454 --> 21:35.191
'cause you're not going to need it.

21:35.316 --> 21:37.346
This isn't one of your
really bad ideas, is it?

21:37.471 --> 21:39.107
This is one of
my really great ideas.

21:43.879 --> 21:45.986
It's amazing how fast the years go.

21:46.111 --> 21:48.264
It seems like only yesterday.

21:48.909 --> 21:50.450
All the more reason we need zbz

21:50.575 --> 21:52.624
to remain a part of our lives now.

21:52.749 --> 21:54.494
I'm rebecca logan.

21:55.388 --> 21:57.826
- You kissed ashleigh's boyfriend.
- Excuse me?

21:58.168 --> 22:01.212
- That's not what zbz sisters do.
- Excuse me?

22:01.381 --> 22:04.118
I'm donating to the house, but
i'm giving my money to ashleigh.

22:04.243 --> 22:05.503
Excuse me.

22:08.373 --> 22:10.481
What in the hell have
you been telling people?

22:10.606 --> 22:12.932
- B The truth.
- I suppose she neglected to mention

22:13.057 --> 22:15.603
that she's forgiven her boyfriend,
but she won't forgive me.

22:15.728 --> 22:16.685
Is that true?

22:17.255 --> 22:20.716
She has a completely different
standard for boyfriends than sisters.

22:20.841 --> 22:22.766
That's a little
hypocritical, don't you think?

22:22.891 --> 22:24.722
- No. I don't. Because...
- Well I do.

22:24.847 --> 22:26.845
I think it's time people
found out the whole story.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.656
We have a lot to discuss.

22:33.306 --> 22:34.785
Some group?

22:34.910 --> 22:37.167
Wait, this is your year, isn't it?

22:37.478 --> 22:39.246
I didn't know we brought that down.

22:40.168 --> 22:43.976
Sometimes it helps when
you're being terribly obvious

22:44.101 --> 22:45.731
to just admit it.

22:46.318 --> 22:48.236
I brought it down on purpose.

22:48.636 --> 22:51.195
And you should,
it was a stellar year.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.690
- We won greek week...
- Sports banner,

22:53.815 --> 22:56.341
top gpa, greek blue ribbon.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.727
You know what they say,
the more things change.

22:58.906 --> 23:00.535
The more they stay the same.

23:00.660 --> 23:02.898
This doesn't look the same.

23:03.067 --> 23:05.366
Actually,
this place looks like hell.

23:05.491 --> 23:07.187
It is the same.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.806
Zbz, number one.

23:10.372 --> 23:14.289
<i>The men of omega chi have
courage to always fight</i>

23:14.414 --> 23:16.524
and here are omega
chis serenading us

23:16.649 --> 23:19.538
like they always do, because we're the
number one house.

23:20.245 --> 23:23.418
<i>Where fraternal bonds make us strong</i>

23:23.705 --> 23:27.212
<i>a sword to our chest on the field</i>

23:32.004 --> 23:34.879
<i>the men of omega chi</i>

23:35.004 --> 23:37.197
<i>stout hearts brave and true</i>

23:38.330 --> 23:40.962
just in the nick of time.
You are the best!

23:41.354 --> 23:44.708
Hopefully this'll stir up
some rewarding memories.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.477
Who's the new guy?
I don't recognize him.

23:52.513 --> 23:54.825
He's just here for the weekend.

23:56.774 --> 23:58.473
Do I detect a cartwright crush?

23:58.873 --> 24:00.039
He's all right.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.004
Hey man, I'm evan chambers.

24:03.129 --> 24:04.168
Nate radcliffe.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.150
- Where you from?
- Baltimore.

24:06.275 --> 24:07.762
Balti-more.

24:08.340 --> 24:10.025
Would you excuse us for a minute?

24:10.509 --> 24:11.740
Sure.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.733
- I don't know. I don't like him.
- What? You just met him.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.727
But I got a really
bad feeling about him.

24:20.852 --> 24:22.770
- From a handshake?
- Sweaty palms.

24:24.940 --> 24:26.456
Wait a minute. Are you jealous?

24:26.859 --> 24:27.798
What?

24:28.240 --> 24:30.926
Jealous? No, I'm
not jealous. I'm concerned.

24:31.051 --> 24:33.072
- I thought we were friends.
- We are friends.

24:33.197 --> 24:35.172
And as your friend, i'm telling you,

24:35.615 --> 24:37.785
I don't like douche
bigalow over there.

24:40.447 --> 24:42.385
And that sounds like cappie.

24:49.687 --> 24:52.186
You guard the door, I'll get
the pictures from the computer.

24:52.907 --> 24:54.176
And then what?

24:56.555 --> 24:58.973
Then I'll get her pictures
in front of professor belski.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.564
It's just one of those things
boyfriends do for

25:01.689 --> 25:03.580
their girlfriends
because they love them.

25:03.705 --> 25:06.188
Are you sure you're doing this
for jordan, or for you?

25:07.526 --> 25:10.025
OK, I don't think that's really...

25:18.619 --> 25:19.451
Surprise!

25:20.421 --> 25:22.037
Rusty! What are you doing here?

25:23.498 --> 25:26.202
I thought since we had
that afternoon free...

25:26.327 --> 25:29.169
That we would play Stephen Hawking

25:29.337 --> 25:31.238
and the naughty
scientist girl again?

25:32.804 --> 25:34.998
C'mon, say it.
Say it. Say it for me!

25:36.011 --> 25:37.222
Rusty, say it!

25:39.765 --> 25:41.571
Take off your clothes.

25:44.436 --> 25:45.450
Actually...

25:47.898 --> 25:49.864
I thought first
we could actually go...

25:50.401 --> 25:52.151
We could study somewhere else.

25:52.319 --> 25:53.610
You surprised me to study?

25:54.140 --> 25:55.362
As foreplay.

26:06.619 --> 26:07.982
Straight people...

26:15.425 --> 26:17.284
I had fun tonight.

26:17.795 --> 26:21.078
To be honest, I haven't really
done much dating lately.

26:21.203 --> 26:22.193
Me either.

26:22.612 --> 26:24.324
Doris tends to take up
a lot of time.

26:25.481 --> 26:26.602
I can only imagine.

26:27.735 --> 26:29.521
What do you do for her, anyway?

26:29.931 --> 26:32.608
- I'm a friend who helps her out.
- Helps her out how?

26:32.776 --> 26:34.305
Crossing the street? Opening jars?

26:34.430 --> 26:37.390
Aiding and abetting sorority girls
who dare cross her path?

26:38.574 --> 26:39.734
It's complicated.

26:41.463 --> 26:42.749
So in the interest of

26:43.171 --> 26:44.499
keeping this simple.

26:55.731 --> 26:56.754
By the way,

26:57.175 --> 26:58.258
I talked to doris.

26:58.426 --> 27:00.269
She's gonna write ZBZ
a nice big check.

27:00.394 --> 27:02.763
That's amazing, thank you!

27:02.931 --> 27:06.223
Even after you slip me my percentage,
you're gonna have a lot for the house.

27:06.905 --> 27:08.577
- Your what?
- My cut.

27:09.899 --> 27:11.257
I was thinking 20 percent,

27:11.812 --> 27:14.277
but since you're so incredibly hot,
I'll take 15.

27:15.709 --> 27:17.348
That money is supposed to be

27:17.473 --> 27:19.696
a charitable donation
to the sorority.

27:19.864 --> 27:22.074
And it will be.
Most of it, anyway.

27:22.780 --> 27:24.660
And what if I tell doris?

27:27.099 --> 27:28.121
Be smart, Casey.

27:28.315 --> 27:29.245
No offense,

27:29.370 --> 27:31.875
you don't want to do anything
that you're gonna regret later.

27:33.449 --> 27:34.553
I already did.

27:43.815 --> 27:46.557
I still can't believe
you wanted to come to an art show.

27:47.002 --> 27:48.831
I didn't think this was your thing.

27:49.395 --> 27:50.604
I've got a feeling.

27:50.729 --> 27:52.943
We'll both find something
to enjoy here tonight.

27:56.279 --> 27:58.190
If taking pictures makes you happy,

27:58.315 --> 28:00.988
then you belong here at CRU
in the photography department.

28:01.156 --> 28:04.210
And if professor Belski
doesn't look at your portfolio,

28:04.915 --> 28:07.457
maybe she'll look at
your first public showing.

28:10.941 --> 28:12.170
Oh, my God!

28:14.211 --> 28:15.473
My photos...

28:26.053 --> 28:27.389
You remember Jordan Reed?

28:27.999 --> 28:30.972
Of course. I'm looking forward
to seeing your portfolio in may.

28:31.286 --> 28:33.854
We don't have to wait that long.
These are her photos.

28:49.437 --> 28:50.537
What do you think?

28:50.705 --> 28:51.664
Amateurish.

28:52.373 --> 28:55.088
But there is some interesting
composition, depth.

28:55.213 --> 28:56.396
And no eyeballs.

28:56.586 --> 28:59.630
Are you gonna keep annoying me
until I let her into the program?

28:59.798 --> 29:01.008
You can count on it.

29:02.418 --> 29:03.997
I'll probably regret this.

29:04.507 --> 29:06.503
You can begin classes next semester.

29:08.276 --> 29:09.533
It's a three-year program.

29:09.658 --> 29:12.518
Culminating in an art show
you won't have to crash.

29:12.686 --> 29:14.695
- And then?
- You'll have to do what everyone else

29:14.820 --> 29:17.569
does after they graduate
with a degree in photography,

29:18.150 --> 29:19.733
hunt for a job as an assistant.

29:19.901 --> 29:22.444
And if you're good,
you work your way up.

29:34.884 --> 29:36.083
What are you doing here?

29:36.251 --> 29:38.330
I was on a date. With Nate.

29:38.455 --> 29:39.545
It ended early.

29:39.713 --> 29:43.382
I guess I need two dates to figure out
what you got just from shaking his hand.

29:46.108 --> 29:47.845
Sorry I accused you
of being jealous,

29:48.013 --> 29:49.798
you were just looking out for me.

29:57.931 --> 30:00.995
Anyway, he got Doris
to donate money to the house,

30:01.120 --> 30:03.360
then expected a percentage
for himself.

30:03.819 --> 30:04.878
You're kidding.

30:05.714 --> 30:09.620
I should've known. Money has a real
knack for turning guys into jerks.

30:10.901 --> 30:12.202
I didn't mean...

30:12.505 --> 30:13.964
I meant Nate.

30:14.089 --> 30:15.924
No, I get it. It's OK.

30:19.568 --> 30:22.320
I shouldn't have started dating.
I guess I'm not ready.

30:22.445 --> 30:23.366
After...

30:23.687 --> 30:24.810
Max and...

30:26.391 --> 30:27.739
... everything.

30:31.764 --> 30:33.092
I think you're ready.

30:35.174 --> 30:37.621
I just don't think you're ready
to date jerks like him.

30:43.902 --> 30:45.402
Can I walk you home?

30:47.331 --> 30:49.052
I'm good, but...

30:49.488 --> 30:50.425
Thanks.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.069
What was all that about?

31:12.642 --> 31:15.523
I think you were right
about her new douche.

31:18.509 --> 31:19.779
First Max then Nate.

31:20.793 --> 31:22.788
I swear it's all been downhill
since me.

31:25.610 --> 31:26.985
Thanks. Yeah...

31:31.350 --> 31:33.951
We should take pictures
of your pictures.

31:34.733 --> 31:35.911
Is that weird?

31:37.577 --> 31:39.236
Thank you for everything today.

31:39.361 --> 31:41.062
God, it was amazing.

31:47.258 --> 31:48.529
I turned it down.

31:49.554 --> 31:50.547
What? Why?

31:53.174 --> 31:56.142
Rusty, do you know how many classes
I took in community college,

31:56.267 --> 31:57.913
in every possible subject?

31:58.318 --> 32:01.412
How I wanted to believe
that moving here would make me happy?

32:01.537 --> 32:04.410
Even the whole study abroad thing,
it was just another way to buy time

32:04.535 --> 32:07.192
until I figured out
what it was I wanted to do.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.170
- And what is that?
- I want to be a photographer.

32:10.853 --> 32:14.032
I want to be an artist,
not spend my time studying art.

32:14.200 --> 32:17.403
Look, rusty, school is
where you belong, but not me.

32:19.882 --> 32:21.470
And if I want to do this,

32:22.097 --> 32:23.584
I gotta do this for real.

32:25.966 --> 32:27.358
You're dropping out.

32:30.008 --> 32:33.037
So we'll just find you a job here,
you can get an apartment.

32:33.162 --> 32:35.262
There's one in my building,
I was actually...

32:35.430 --> 32:37.309
You know Grant's friend?

32:37.586 --> 32:38.682
The photographer?

32:40.657 --> 32:42.517
I talked to her earlier today.

32:44.969 --> 32:47.350
Rus, this is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

32:51.809 --> 32:53.439
She offered me an internship.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.866
In New York.

33:05.288 --> 33:07.085
Carry the one...

33:08.592 --> 33:12.059
I'm ahead by four-hundred dollars.
And that's just from six alums.

33:12.467 --> 33:15.260
I guess rich people are more comfortable
with cheating than with hypocrisy.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.771
Not so fast. I got more

33:18.167 --> 33:19.778
alums to donate than you.

33:20.291 --> 33:22.960
- So I'm going with the popular vote.
- You're changing the rules?

33:23.333 --> 33:25.896
- I'm winning!
- Anyway, I can't forgive you.

33:26.064 --> 33:27.022
That's not...

33:29.149 --> 33:31.759
You know what? Forget it.
I'm done and I've had it.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.965
With you, with everyone!
Because no matter what I do,

33:34.090 --> 33:35.882
I guess I'll always be
the house slut.

33:40.541 --> 33:42.246
What is wrong with Rebecca?

33:42.812 --> 33:44.086
You floozy!

33:45.870 --> 33:48.001
- Me?
- She must mean rebecca.

33:48.876 --> 33:50.434
I just talked to Nate

33:50.559 --> 33:53.340
and he told me
how you threw yourself at him.

33:53.647 --> 33:54.342
What?

33:54.718 --> 33:55.957
I want... No.

33:56.286 --> 33:58.122
I demand a kitty passing!

34:04.657 --> 34:06.894
You forced yourself on Nate.

34:07.019 --> 34:08.606
With all due respect,
Mrs. McGovern,

34:08.731 --> 34:11.972
Nate tried to squeeze us for 20 percent
of your donation to this house.

34:12.097 --> 34:14.460
At least try to lie convincingly.

34:14.629 --> 34:17.589
Sorry, he said 15 percent
because I'm so incredibly hot.

34:17.757 --> 34:20.175
Someone has an awfully
high opinion of herself.

34:20.342 --> 34:23.511
Oh my god, this is insane.
What is he to you, anyway?

34:23.679 --> 34:26.024
What he is to me
is none of your business.

34:26.545 --> 34:29.559
So yes or no,
do you deny kissing him?

34:29.962 --> 34:33.146
Yes, I mean no...
Yes, I did kiss him.

34:33.313 --> 34:35.255
So you admit it.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.359
You're nothing
but a player and a strumpet.

34:38.527 --> 34:40.402
I didn't know Casey
played the strumpet.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.463
Never mind. I don't care what you think.
And I'm done kissing your ass.

34:44.588 --> 34:47.994
If you don't trust me, I don't want your
money, I don't want you as my sister.

34:48.533 --> 34:49.391
May I?

34:52.958 --> 34:55.697
I don't remember half
the college boys I slept with.

34:56.556 --> 34:59.588
Although there was one Lambda Sig...

35:00.174 --> 35:03.042
It was like he had
the hindenburgin in shorts.

35:06.394 --> 35:08.056
You don't by chance have a point?

35:09.932 --> 35:12.244
My point is that after the boys
in your life have gone,

35:12.369 --> 35:14.646
you'll still have your ZBZ sisters.

35:14.814 --> 35:17.524
- Not the one who kissed my boyfriend.
- Or the one who's a total hypocrite!

35:17.692 --> 35:19.859
Neither one of you is holding pussy.

35:20.928 --> 35:23.006
When all is said and done,
we're sisters.

35:23.131 --> 35:24.864
That's why you always used to say

35:25.033 --> 35:26.828
"Sisters before misters".

35:27.201 --> 35:30.484
- Is that like bros before hos?
- Sisters before misters, damn it!

35:30.871 --> 35:32.757
That's why
we have founder's weekend,

35:32.882 --> 35:35.291
to remind us that men come and go

35:35.459 --> 35:38.860
but our ZBE family is forever.

35:42.883 --> 35:46.604
And families should be honest
with each other and I...

35:47.117 --> 35:47.994
We all,

35:48.119 --> 35:51.571
spent the weekend trying
to get money from our older sisters

35:52.350 --> 35:55.562
using all kinds of methods.
Because the truth is...

35:57.315 --> 35:58.576
We're in trouble.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.900
We're not number one anymore.

36:01.481 --> 36:03.444
We're sort of fourth. Ish.

36:05.830 --> 36:08.572
We were hoping to raise enough money
to make some improvements on the house,

36:08.697 --> 36:10.910
throw some killer mixers
and eventually have

36:11.035 --> 36:13.545
the best rush
this campus has ever seen.

36:14.081 --> 36:15.582
Sisters before everything else.

36:15.909 --> 36:17.971
It's a shame
that's so easy to forget.

36:20.004 --> 36:21.087
I have to pee.

36:35.188 --> 36:38.552
You want coffee, milk, soda?

36:38.677 --> 36:42.625
- I got some leftover kettlewell corn...
- How about talking to me about tonight.

36:53.850 --> 36:55.785
I can't believe
that you're really going

36:56.671 --> 36:59.167
I helped you, and I encouraged
and supported you,

37:00.598 --> 37:02.153
and now you're just gonna leave?

37:03.952 --> 37:04.920
I'm sorry.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.566
I'm sorry too,

37:07.186 --> 37:10.252
If this is how you get repaid
for being a good boyfriend.

37:12.261 --> 37:15.606
You do stuff for someone
because you love them,

37:17.496 --> 37:20.271
then they wake up one morning
and then they say "So long".

37:21.653 --> 37:24.114
You've always known
what you wanted to do

37:24.964 --> 37:27.435
and that's why I love
being with you because

37:28.066 --> 37:31.067
you made me feel like one day
I'd figure out my thing, too.

37:32.165 --> 37:35.912
And it's because of you that I'm finally
doing what's right for me.

37:43.657 --> 37:45.363
Excuse me if...

37:46.590 --> 37:49.624
- I'm not all smiley about it.
- Neither am I,

37:50.340 --> 37:52.973
because the one thing
I don't want is for us to end.

37:54.587 --> 37:56.121
I don't think we have to.

37:57.331 --> 38:00.092
I mean, plenty of people
do the whole long-distance thing.

38:00.982 --> 38:03.007
What about
when I was gonna go to Europe?

38:03.441 --> 38:06.633
There's a difference. If you were going
to Europe, you were coming back.

38:22.281 --> 38:24.127
I think pussy-willow is dead.

38:26.816 --> 38:28.424
I have the final tally.

38:31.074 --> 38:32.302
How much did I won by?

38:32.470 --> 38:34.061
Apparently, that kitty passing made

38:34.496 --> 38:35.871
everyone come together

38:35.996 --> 38:37.779
and we raised another 900 dollars,

38:38.585 --> 38:40.841
but it became a popularity contest.

38:41.793 --> 38:43.104
They liked me more.

38:43.272 --> 38:44.630
Then sober sister, it is.

38:47.380 --> 38:49.013
I want to know why you did it.

38:50.122 --> 38:51.446
Why did you kiss him?

38:55.396 --> 38:57.135
I was just lonely and drunk.

38:58.709 --> 39:00.038
You're my best friend,

39:00.206 --> 39:02.332
and you weren't around
because you were with Fisher.

39:02.981 --> 39:04.459
So you were jealous of me?

39:04.799 --> 39:06.782
I guess I wanted
what I couldn't have,

39:07.279 --> 39:10.423
and I haven't had what I wanted
in a really long time.

39:10.591 --> 39:11.902
What do you want?

39:12.583 --> 39:13.588
To be happy.

39:15.430 --> 39:17.053
But every single time,

39:17.401 --> 39:18.904
something gets in the way.

39:20.340 --> 39:22.693
You get in the way.
You know that, right?

39:23.306 --> 39:25.671
When life gets too comfortable,
I screw things up.

39:26.767 --> 39:28.566
I'm comfortable
in the uncomfortable.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.750
It's just what I do.

39:35.569 --> 39:36.972
Forget sober sister,

39:37.097 --> 39:38.577
That's for the pledges

39:39.537 --> 39:40.895
I think we're good now.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.378
- Really?
- On a probationary basis.

39:46.687 --> 39:48.101
Because if you do it again,

39:48.585 --> 39:50.046
you'll end up like pussy-willow.

40:06.689 --> 40:07.688
For the house.

40:12.027 --> 40:14.487
Does this have anything to do
with kitty passing?

40:15.740 --> 40:16.836
Nate caved.

40:16.961 --> 40:19.033
He told me he tried
hitting you up for money.

40:19.201 --> 40:20.976
15 percent.

40:23.987 --> 40:26.999
So if you know Nate lied,
why is he still with you?

40:27.167 --> 40:27.959
I mean...

40:28.315 --> 40:31.045
What exactly does he do for you?

40:42.126 --> 40:43.403
You confessed?

40:43.892 --> 40:46.278
Don't play dumb.
You sicced your two thugs on me.

40:46.892 --> 40:47.993
My two what?

40:48.814 --> 40:49.772
That Cappie guy.

40:52.276 --> 40:56.101
Him and the ass in the iron man audi.
The two of them were waiting at my hotel

40:56.226 --> 40:58.531
and they told me
to stay away from you.

41:09.634 --> 41:12.590
I guess I finally get to cash in
on my gotcha win.

41:13.839 --> 41:16.466
It's too bad that's a
going-away party though.

41:17.717 --> 41:20.553
Thank you so much for everything,
for always being there helping me

41:20.721 --> 41:21.929
feel like I belonged.

41:22.097 --> 41:24.348
I couldn't have
asked for a better big sis.

41:25.161 --> 41:29.145
You'll have a lot of people waiting here
for you if you ever need us.

41:29.313 --> 41:31.260
Enough of the schmaltz.
Come on.

41:32.098 --> 41:33.441
Good luck in New York.

41:33.609 --> 41:35.656
Put your money in your sock,
don't eat from a cart,

41:35.781 --> 41:38.738
and never ever trust anyone
remotely like me.

41:41.557 --> 41:42.742
As I always say:

41:42.910 --> 41:44.541
be cool, stay in school.

41:44.666 --> 41:46.438
I can't believe
she's actually going.

41:48.033 --> 41:48.998
Nate left too.

41:49.166 --> 41:50.666
He turned out to be a total jerk.

41:50.834 --> 41:52.668
But you knew that already.

41:52.836 --> 41:54.420
I still say he's doing the old lady.

41:54.588 --> 41:59.383
Before he left he told me that
you and some guy in an iron man audi

41:59.551 --> 42:01.552
told him to stay away from me.

42:03.461 --> 42:04.896
Isn't that crazy?

42:05.182 --> 42:08.392
What would I be doing with iron man?
He's not even a real guy.

42:08.560 --> 42:10.061
Evan has an iron man audi.

42:10.229 --> 42:10.978
Does he?

42:11.939 --> 42:13.981
I'd be more likely
to hang out with iron man.

42:16.936 --> 42:18.903
Rebecca an I are friends again.

42:19.071 --> 42:19.802
Why?

42:22.736 --> 42:23.574
Sisterhood.

42:30.207 --> 42:31.657
Maybe it won't work out?

42:33.378 --> 42:35.231
Maybe I'll be back in a month.

42:35.962 --> 42:37.083
You never know.

42:37.658 --> 42:38.856
You never know.

42:39.520 --> 42:41.801
Stay here.
I wanna get a picture.

42:47.474 --> 42:48.474
Don't worry.

42:48.642 --> 42:49.809
You'll see her again.

42:53.021 --> 42:54.043
Sure I will.
