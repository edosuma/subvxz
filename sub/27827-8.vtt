00:46.005 --> 00:47.651
- Are you gonna cum, babe?
- Yeah.

00:47.675 --> 00:48.675
Yeah.

01:02.755 --> 01:05.625
- You didn't cum again.
- Yeah, I did.

01:05.715 --> 01:09.125
No, you didn't.

01:11.335 --> 01:13.965
I did.

01:16.545 --> 01:17.545
No, you didn't.

01:27.465 --> 01:28.625
Uh, stop, stop.

01:28.715 --> 01:30.965
St... stop.

01:31.045 --> 01:32.795
I haven't showered.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.085
I don't care.

01:37.545 --> 01:40.465
Tastes good to me.

01:40.545 --> 01:42.085
Close your eyes.

01:48.295 --> 01:51.175
Rafi, stop.

01:51.255 --> 01:53.715
No, Rafi, stop, stop. I
keep thinking about my mom.

01:53.795 --> 01:55.675
I just... I can't do this.

01:55.755 --> 01:57.255
You're thinking about your mom?

01:58.686 --> 02:01.440
She's not coming until
the afternoon, babe. Relax.

02:01.475 --> 02:03.538
Just stop thinking about your mom.

- How much you pay?

02:32.505 --> 02:34.505
What? No, I use... 
used Ally's credit card.

02:34.585 --> 02:35.795
- What?
- Hang on.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.915
Let me turn the music down.

02:38.005 --> 02:39.731

02:41.005 --> 02:42.335
I said I used Ally's credit card,

but I am going to pay her back.

02:43.990 --> 02:45.665
Taking the rich people's money.

02:45.690 --> 02:47.534
- No.
- That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

02:47.559 --> 02:49.585
I really gotta give it back to her.

02:49.675 --> 02:50.965
This is becoming a problem.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.585
Yeah, I see. What else you get, then?

02:52.675 --> 02:54.335
Um, I got pussy stuff.

02:54.425 --> 02:57.335
This is comedy. Pussy straws.

02:57.360 --> 02:59.000
I also got a stripper
coming from Groupon.

02:59.025 --> 03:01.235
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Mm-hmm.

03:01.425 --> 03:02.875
You sure about the stripper, though?

03:02.900 --> 03:04.980
What? Rafi loves strippers.

03:05.005 --> 03:07.101
- His mom was a stripper.
- Exactly. Stripper, alcohol...

03:07.125 --> 03:08.835
- I don't know.
- You know what? Actually,

03:08.915 --> 03:10.561
We should probably order
her before it gets too late.

03:10.585 --> 03:12.191
I need your help, 'cause
we can customize her.

03:12.215 --> 03:13.821
- Okay.
- Get a blonde.

03:13.846 --> 03:16.072
"Get a blonde"? No.
A blonde's so boring.

03:16.127 --> 03:17.351
- Yuck. Gross.
- You're a hater.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.625
No. Nelson's a blonde.

03:18.650 --> 03:20.210
We gotta get a girl he could never get.

03:20.445 --> 03:21.678
What he can't get?

03:21.703 --> 03:23.263
There's a lot of girls he couldn't get.

03:23.539 --> 03:24.869
Like a girl from Long Island

03:24.949 --> 03:26.345
who had One Direction
play at her bat mitzvah.

03:26.369 --> 03:28.079
Couldn't get her.

03:28.159 --> 03:29.879
A Scottish lady who's
into Highland dancing.

03:29.949 --> 03:31.568
- Hmm?
- A Native American

03:31.593 --> 03:32.811
who's never been off the res.

03:32.843 --> 03:34.497
- I could keep going.
- That's mad specific.

03:34.521 --> 03:35.521
Is that even an option?

03:35.546 --> 03:37.256
No, but you can pick a hair color.

03:37.510 --> 03:39.420
"Blonde, black, red, bald, 'fro."

03:39.510 --> 03:40.750
- Red.
- Red.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.510
Okay. Breasts.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.090
- I like Bs.
- I like Cs.

03:44.170 --> 03:45.630
- What about Ds?
- Ds is cool.

03:45.710 --> 03:48.420
- What about double Ds?
- Double Ds!

03:48.510 --> 03:50.170
Fs!

03:50.260 --> 03:51.800
- F is the wave.
- F would be wild.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.670
- Let's get the wild.
- Okay. F.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.260
Oh, no. F is extra.

03:55.340 --> 03:56.460
Oh. Get the Ds.

03:56.550 --> 03:59.010
Get the Ds. On it!

03:59.090 --> 04:01.420
"Searching."

04:01.510 --> 04:03.670
"Ember"!

04:03.750 --> 04:06.340
"An Ember to remember."

04:06.420 --> 04:08.750
She knows when to hold 'em.
She knows when to fold 'em,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.146
"She knows when to sit on your dick."

04:10.170 --> 04:11.750
- That's a great brand.
- Great brand.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.050
Order her.

04:23.340 --> 04:25.840
Come on.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.670
Come on. Come on.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.920
Shit.

04:31.010 --> 04:35.050
Oof.

04:40.130 --> 04:41.810
- Hi!
- Come in, come in, come in.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.630
Hello. Hi, beauty.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.800
Hi. Oh, my God.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.460
Winnie, you look so different.

04:47.550 --> 04:49.050
Can you move back a bit, please?

04:49.130 --> 04:50.690
My personal space bubble's quite large.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.920
But you're not anymore.

04:53.010 --> 04:54.630
Doesn't she look amazing?

04:54.710 --> 04:56.750
Mm-hmm. Hey, who wants some wine?

04:56.840 --> 04:58.630
I do. What's the Wi-Fi?

04:58.710 --> 05:00.340
Oh, um, it's #blessed,

05:00.420 --> 05:03.130
smiley face, smiley face.

05:03.210 --> 05:05.010
- What do you think?
- I like it.

05:05.035 --> 05:06.606
- Of the house?
- But as you get older,

05:06.630 --> 05:09.000
you realize that less is more, you know?

05:09.124 --> 05:10.414
Uh-huh.

05:10.439 --> 05:12.876
- I almost died.
- Yes, she did.

05:12.901 --> 05:15.768
But there's always a silver
lining to every story.

05:16.589 --> 05:18.760
My kidneys nearly completely shut down.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.615
Yeah, but look what you got out of it.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.848
You dropped 30 pounds.

05:21.896 --> 05:23.646
I had to wear diapers for a month,

05:23.726 --> 05:25.976
which actually, I quite liked.

05:26.066 --> 05:28.016
I never had to get up
to go to the bathroom.

05:28.106 --> 05:29.556
Thank you.

05:29.646 --> 05:32.016
So Dad's not... Dad's not coming in?

05:32.106 --> 05:34.396
Maybe I should start a
line of adult diapers.

05:34.476 --> 05:38.378
But not for old people.
For, like, cool young adults.

05:38.941 --> 05:40.325
Black for evening.

05:40.350 --> 05:41.596
Dad is not coming

05:41.605 --> 05:43.405
because he doesn't wanna
see you in your dress

05:43.475 --> 05:45.435
before the big day.

05:45.515 --> 05:46.515
That's the groom, Mum.

05:46.555 --> 05:50.105
Would you shut up, Winnie?

05:50.185 --> 05:52.765
Ew. That's so gross.

05:55.515 --> 05:56.935
Wait, will you rub my feet?

05:57.015 --> 05:58.765
So catch up. Tell me about Bali.

05:58.855 --> 06:02.105
Oh, my God. I met this
guru, Ravana Shiva.

06:02.185 --> 06:05.015
Oh, he's amazing. He's
a spiritual healer.

06:05.105 --> 06:08.855
- Yeah?
- He opened me up completely.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.355
I mean, I was really stuck before.

06:11.435 --> 06:15.015
Like, he massaged my eyes
for, like, 20 minutes,

06:15.105 --> 06:17.776
and if he just touched my hair,

06:17.823 --> 06:19.339
I would have an orgasm.

06:19.395 --> 06:22.515
I would be laying on
the table and just, like,

06:22.605 --> 06:25.855
shaking with this full-body vibration.

06:25.935 --> 06:28.765
He would just... he
could... he sucked my toes.

06:30.145 --> 06:33.515
It was amazing. It was so freeing.

06:33.605 --> 06:36.895
Oh, God.

06:36.975 --> 06:40.765
- It's hot.
- Yes, it is!

06:40.855 --> 06:44.315
- It's effin' hot.
- I know.

06:44.395 --> 06:46.605
Maybe you shouldn't wear
a sweater on your neck.

06:46.685 --> 06:48.291
- Come on. What are you doing?
- I'm just saying.

06:48.315 --> 06:50.315
- No, what are you doing?
- This is a will packet.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.340
- I got it at the post office.
- Oh, God.

06:52.475 --> 06:54.555
It's always so effing
depressing when I come in here.

06:54.645 --> 06:55.951
What's depressing about a will packet?

06:55.975 --> 06:57.291
Every time I come in
here, somebody's dead

06:57.315 --> 06:58.531
or somebody's taking their meds

06:58.555 --> 06:59.935
or somebody's asleep on the couch.

07:00.015 --> 07:01.685
Well, jeez, I'm sorry that Joe died

07:01.765 --> 07:03.065
when it wasn't your timetable.

07:03.145 --> 07:04.917
No, come on. You don't
have to do all this, Coll.

07:04.934 --> 07:07.807
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
And besides, it said right here

07:07.832 --> 07:10.738
that maybe I've got a good
five or ten more years in me

07:10.763 --> 07:13.013
- and that's it. That's it.
- Oh, Coll! Who said that?

07:13.093 --> 07:14.649
- A computer said... 
- They said it right there

07:14.673 --> 07:16.513
- on the computer.
- That's a computer program!

07:16.553 --> 07:19.223
So that's it. I'm staying here.
I am not moving, all right?

07:19.303 --> 07:21.053
And I'm going upstairs to take a shower.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.173
I'm so hot.

07:23.263 --> 07:24.763
You have psoriasis?

07:24.843 --> 07:26.343
Five to ten years left!

07:26.423 --> 07:27.903
Gross.

07:27.962 --> 07:29.528
So you'd go to Hawaii
to go get a kombucha?

07:29.552 --> 07:31.362
Why don't you just go to Puerto Rico

07:31.387 --> 07:32.792
and do, like, the ayahuasca shit?

07:32.817 --> 07:34.237
My cousin does it all the time...

07:34.317 --> 07:35.997
Okay, guys! He-he's
here. Hide, hide, hide.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.043
Quick, quick. Before he comes in.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.737
Come on, come on.

07:41.897 --> 07:43.107
Yo, Carlos.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.447
Yo, 'Los!

07:44.527 --> 07:46.817
Surprise!

07:46.897 --> 07:48.447
Ay! Whoa!

07:49.987 --> 07:51.897
Teta! Teta!

07:51.987 --> 07:53.663
Titties in your face!
Titties in your face!

07:53.687 --> 07:55.817
Teta! Teta!

07:55.897 --> 07:57.987
This is your bachelor party

07:58.067 --> 07:59.987
in my house, courtesy of Bridge.

08:00.067 --> 08:01.987
- It's all her.
- Thank you!

08:02.067 --> 08:03.737
- You did this?
- Yep.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.397
- Coca Cola... 
- Bachelor party!

08:05.487 --> 08:07.327
- A cup for my big brother.
- A cup? All right.

08:07.357 --> 08:09.357
No, I have this for
you. It's a pink penis

08:09.447 --> 08:11.197
filled with coconut water.

08:11.277 --> 08:13.817
- Oh, thank you.
- Okay. Let's get started.

08:15.447 --> 08:18.987
Nelson, why won't these things work?

08:19.067 --> 08:20.715
- Oh.
- Mum, do you really

08:20.740 --> 08:23.637
need to charge every single
one of your devices right now?

08:23.662 --> 08:25.202
Nelson's wearing the dress.

08:25.306 --> 08:27.306
Yeah, I do.

08:27.527 --> 08:29.676
- It's very tight.
- How is that possible?

08:29.701 --> 08:32.080
You're like a skeleton with a wig on.

08:32.105 --> 08:33.113
- Hey.
- Sorry.

08:33.168 --> 08:34.806
I'm very tired from the flight.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.371
Mom was in first class,
but I was in economy.

08:38.451 --> 08:41.160
No, you were in economy plus.

08:41.241 --> 08:43.621
Gratitude, Winnie.

08:44.741 --> 08:48.699
Oh! You look so beautiful.

08:48.724 --> 08:51.779
- Whee.
- Look at her.

08:51.873 --> 08:53.459
Yeah, you look like a painting.

08:53.483 --> 08:55.773
Actually, you look just like me.

08:55.863 --> 08:59.193
I was tiny.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.944
I wish your father was here to see you.

09:02.117 --> 09:03.947
- Don't you think?
- Mm.

09:04.037 --> 09:05.867
One big, happy family.

09:05.947 --> 09:07.828
I think I know what he would say.

09:07.853 --> 09:10.657
- What?
- "I am so honored

09:10.737 --> 09:14.217
to hand off my prettiest"...

09:14.242 --> 09:15.287
Stop.

09:15.367 --> 09:17.787
... "sweetest, straightest"...

09:17.867 --> 09:19.617
Don't do this.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.040
... "blondest daughter"...

09:21.065 --> 09:22.423
Oh, come on.

09:22.448 --> 09:23.751
"The one who, if she died,"

09:23.776 --> 09:25.660
it would really mess me up for a while,

09:25.685 --> 09:27.632
"and she does have a
job, which is good."

09:27.657 --> 09:29.577
Stop it.

09:29.657 --> 09:31.697
You are so funny, Winnie.

09:31.722 --> 09:34.592
But you know that we love
you both exactly the same.

09:34.737 --> 09:36.787
Mm-hmm. Fuck, it's hot in here.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.947
Can you turn the air con up?

09:39.037 --> 09:42.447
Ugh, I can feel my fat flaps chafing.

09:42.527 --> 09:44.367
My thighs are all wet and sweaty.

09:44.447 --> 09:45.947
Here, let me fix this.

09:46.037 --> 09:47.527
Ooh.

09:47.617 --> 09:50.157
You are so gorgeous.

09:50.237 --> 09:52.077
- I'm excited.
- You are?

09:52.157 --> 09:54.867
Yeah, I'm excited to... to wear this.

09:54.947 --> 09:57.827
- Yeah?
- And get married.

09:57.907 --> 10:01.947
I know! My baby, you're
gonna get married.

10:02.037 --> 10:03.697
- Mm-hmm. -
My little one.

10:05.407 --> 10:07.237
You're so beautiful.

10:07.327 --> 10:10.617
You really are so pretty.

10:10.697 --> 10:12.737
You're gonna be a bride, yeah?

10:14.577 --> 10:16.737
Don't you feel sexy?

10:16.827 --> 10:18.787
So feminine and sensual.

10:18.867 --> 10:20.447
Get off. It's hot.

10:20.527 --> 10:22.447
- Yeah?
- Told you it was hot in here.

10:22.527 --> 10:24.327
It is kind of hot in here.

10:27.117 --> 10:29.577
I feel like I can't breathe.
Can you help me get out?

10:29.657 --> 10:31.013
- I need to take it off.
- What?

10:31.037 --> 10:32.617
- I need to take it off.
- Really?

10:32.697 --> 10:34.237
Um, I don't wanna wear this anymore.

10:34.327 --> 10:36.617
Okay. We're gonna...

10:36.697 --> 10:38.617
- Can you take it off?
- Yes, I'm doing it.

10:38.697 --> 10:40.787
- Please hurry.
- It's a really old zipper.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.367
Winnie! Can you come and help me?

10:43.447 --> 10:45.657
It's stuck in the lining. See?

10:45.737 --> 10:48.527
- Let me try.
- Can you hurry?

10:48.617 --> 10:51.037
Oh, shit. Fuck, it's really stuck.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.697
Can we just pull it off really hard?

10:52.787 --> 10:54.327
No, 'cause you'll rip it.

10:54.407 --> 10:57.077
Hold on. Don't do that
breathing thing like that.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.987
- I can't... 
- Hang on.

10:59.077 --> 11:00.867
I once stretched out a pair of jeans

11:00.892 --> 11:02.602
by soaking them in some hot water.

11:02.682 --> 11:03.713
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:03.738 --> 11:05.447
Just...

11:07.157 --> 11:08.447
One, two, three.

11:08.527 --> 11:10.617

Her mood swings

11:38.671 --> 11:40.987
ranging from elation to despair,

11:41.077 --> 11:43.037
she describes dying as an art.

11:43.117 --> 11:45.197
- Mm.
- In her famous poem

11:45.287 --> 11:47.138
Lady Lazarus, written shortly

11:47.169 --> 11:48.761
after she and Ted separated...

11:48.827 --> 11:50.197
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:50.287 --> 11:52.077
- What are you doing now?
- Oh, thank you.

11:52.157 --> 11:53.553
... Sylvia speaks about her depression...

11:53.577 --> 11:55.907
That thing just said
I'm gonna live to 120.

11:55.987 --> 11:58.447
I bet you will.

11:58.527 --> 12:00.367
Oh, fuck, it's hot.

12:00.447 --> 12:02.367
... physical aggression, and many say

12:02.447 --> 12:03.803
this abusive relationship
ultimately led...

12:03.827 --> 12:05.447
Oh, shit.

12:05.527 --> 12:06.843
... to Sylvia's suicide.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.947
Oh, shit, no. Not that again.

12:09.037 --> 12:10.327
- What again?
- Depressing stuff.

12:10.407 --> 12:13.157
It's real life, Jackie. Open your eyes.

12:13.237 --> 12:14.593
I know it's real life.
It's also real boring.

12:14.617 --> 12:15.987
It's real depressing.

12:16.077 --> 12:17.737
Oh, come on.

12:17.827 --> 12:19.287
It's mother's milk to me, honey.

12:19.367 --> 12:20.787
Oh, please.

12:20.867 --> 12:23.157
She was a local, you know? Boston.

12:23.237 --> 12:25.077
"I rise with my red hair",

12:25.157 --> 12:26.907
and I eat men like air."

12:28.527 --> 12:30.287
What the fuck is she talking about?

12:30.367 --> 12:32.447
Oh, she's talking about
she's underappreciated,

12:32.527 --> 12:34.527
and you know what?

12:34.617 --> 12:37.284
She's still got it in her to
rip their heads off, you know?

12:37.417 --> 12:38.947
Oh, yeah, you got that from the poem.

12:39.037 --> 12:41.058
- I did.
- Oh, God, it's hot.

12:41.245 --> 12:43.237
It is hot. Oh, Jackie.

12:43.327 --> 12:44.803
- We're going to the beach.
- We're what?

12:44.827 --> 12:46.303
- Let's go to the beach.
- No, Jackie.

12:46.327 --> 12:48.197
- Yeah.
- Come on. I don't wanna go

12:48.287 --> 12:49.963
- to the beach now, Jackie.
- I'm getting your swimsuit.

12:49.987 --> 12:51.117
The sand sticks everywhere.

12:51.197 --> 12:52.697
You get it in your hoo-ha. Forget it.

12:52.787 --> 12:54.407
Where's your swimsuit? Coll?

12:54.487 --> 12:56.907
It's in my luggage right there.

12:56.987 --> 12:59.737
Your luggage? Where you going?

12:59.827 --> 13:01.077
It's from the river cruise.

13:01.157 --> 13:03.367
I haven't been able to unpack it.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.577
We can unpack it together.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.737
... drawn to Hughes, who she described...

13:10.827 --> 13:13.787
You want me to do it?

13:13.867 --> 13:15.077
Sure.

13:15.157 --> 13:16.787
- Yeah.
- You know what I'll do?

13:16.867 --> 13:18.037
I'll go out on the back porch

13:18.117 --> 13:20.657
and I'll fill up Larry's kiddy pool.

13:20.737 --> 13:23.527
You come out when you're done.

13:25.407 --> 13:26.807
Ay!

13:26.867 --> 13:30.197
Oh!

13:30.287 --> 13:32.487
Let's go!

13:32.577 --> 13:34.197
Ay! Ay!

13:37.617 --> 13:39.197
No!

13:39.287 --> 13:40.577
Ah!

13:43.157 --> 13:44.503
You should be wearing this shit, though.

13:44.527 --> 13:46.117
"Hola, wife. Adiós, life." Hola, wife.

13:46.197 --> 13:48.037
Okay, everyone. Listen up.

13:48.117 --> 13:49.303
It's time to give Rafi advice.

13:49.327 --> 13:51.466
You gotta give Rafi
some advice as he embarks

13:51.491 --> 13:53.407
- on this journey.
- No. Boo. Nah.

13:53.487 --> 13:55.367
- You're first.
- Uh...

13:55.447 --> 13:57.697
now that you're getting married,

13:57.787 --> 14:00.577
next time, don't send a
picture of Nelson's tits,

14:00.657 --> 14:02.327
because I can't unsee these no more.

14:02.407 --> 14:03.883
What? That's not...

14:03.907 --> 14:05.001
- I don't like that shit.
- Stop.

14:05.025 --> 14:07.987
- That's so fucked up.
- We weren't serious yet.

14:08.077 --> 14:09.463
- I mean, you're kind of right.
- Yo, delete that shit.

14:09.487 --> 14:11.867
I mean, I masturbated to
those tits so many times.

14:11.947 --> 14:13.327
- You what?
- What?

14:17.237 --> 14:18.237
I'm just kidding.

14:19.827 --> 14:23.327
Ay!

14:23.407 --> 14:24.947
- They ain't even that nice.
- Stop.

14:25.037 --> 14:26.383
No, they're nice. She's so beautiful.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.987
Yo, Carlos, you see what you did?

14:28.077 --> 14:29.263
- Change the subject.
- Yeah, she's beautiful.

14:29.287 --> 14:31.327
She's hot. She's hot, but, like...

14:31.407 --> 14:33.673
I like Nelson, but just... 
nah, y'all are laughing at shit,

14:33.697 --> 14:35.737
but, like, if that
white South African bitch

14:35.827 --> 14:37.047
do some shit to you, I'll, like...

14:38.867 --> 14:40.263
Like, I'll fucking kill
that bitch like it's no...

14:40.287 --> 14:42.037
- She's South African?
- Australian.

14:42.117 --> 14:44.144
Whatever, but, like, I support you,

14:44.169 --> 14:46.947
and you, you...

14:47.037 --> 14:48.287
you're worth love.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.617
That's all I gotta
say. You're worth love.

14:50.697 --> 14:52.284
- That means so much to me.
- I love you, Rafi.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.628
- I love you, sis. All right?
- Okay, I'll go next.

14:54.652 --> 14:55.924
- My turn.
- Oh, no.

14:55.940 --> 14:57.860
I feel like I'm giving away the bride.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.940
Um...

15:00.701 --> 15:01.911
no, for real, though.

15:01.936 --> 15:03.436
I was thinking about it earlier,

15:03.461 --> 15:05.052
and I was thinking about the time

15:05.076 --> 15:06.560
when I was eight months pregnant,

15:06.585 --> 15:08.682
you were passed out on the
one piece of furniture we had

15:08.706 --> 15:10.576
and you told me you had the flu.

15:10.656 --> 15:13.116
But really, you were high on syrup.

15:13.206 --> 15:15.996
Uh, and I was thinking about the time

15:16.076 --> 15:19.116
you needed to go get
that OxyContin or whatever

15:19.206 --> 15:21.406
from that guy in Maryland... Baltimore,

15:21.496 --> 15:23.066
and you were begging
me to come with you,

15:23.090 --> 15:24.604
but my grandma was in the hospital.

15:24.629 --> 15:25.874
You were like, "Baby, I
need you. I just need you."

15:25.898 --> 15:27.174
I can't be away from you,"

15:27.206 --> 15:29.916
and so I went with you instead
of visiting my grandmother.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.996
Remember?

15:34.786 --> 15:37.366
And then she died.

15:37.456 --> 15:39.342
And then I was thinking about the time

15:39.366 --> 15:43.189
that... I mean, the many times,

15:43.214 --> 15:45.111
but this one stood out in particular,

15:45.136 --> 15:48.706
where I locked myself in our
room with all that takeout

15:48.831 --> 15:50.976
and hundreds of dollars'
worth of groceries.

15:51.056 --> 15:53.056
And you dragged me out

15:53.136 --> 15:54.869
and you made me go to
the Museum of Fine Arts

15:54.893 --> 15:56.516
even though you hate art

15:56.596 --> 15:59.136
'cause you knew that was what I needed.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.936
And so we've seen each
other at our worst,

16:02.016 --> 16:03.976
at our shittiest,

16:04.056 --> 16:06.096
and yet, here we are...

16:06.176 --> 16:09.476
you know, doing the boob race
and pin the hair on the pussy

16:09.556 --> 16:11.686
and all of us here together.

16:11.766 --> 16:13.585
Just, my point is that

16:13.695 --> 16:15.085
we've been through some shit

16:15.110 --> 16:18.528
and never gave up on each other.

16:18.626 --> 16:20.956
And... you're such a good dad.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.441
You need some tissue?

16:22.466 --> 16:23.843
Cheers.

16:23.868 --> 16:25.828
- Salud!
- Yeah, salud, salud, salud.

16:25.853 --> 16:27.931
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

16:27.968 --> 16:30.628
- I'm here for you forever.
- Cheers. Me too.

16:30.718 --> 16:33.088
But I wanna tell y'all about the time...

16:33.178 --> 16:36.810
that he shit his pants
in fucking Target.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.152
- Get the fuck out of here.
- In Target!

16:38.176 --> 16:39.677
- You wish.
- It's 'cause of

16:39.702 --> 16:42.154
all the supplements you
take. It's not good for you.

16:42.179 --> 16:43.665
Yo, Raf, you had white
tighty-whities on...

16:45.479 --> 16:47.559
- That shit is real.
- I did not hear that story.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.825
- The fuck, Raf?
- You need some more?

16:49.849 --> 16:52.019
Um, I need to slow down.
I need to slow down.

16:52.099 --> 16:53.575
Yeah, slow it down,

16:53.599 --> 16:55.769
slow it down.

17:43.179 --> 17:44.700
Coll?

17:44.725 --> 17:45.889
Yeah?

17:45.979 --> 17:47.849
I found this in your suitcase.

17:47.939 --> 17:49.639
Oh, yeah? What's that?

17:49.729 --> 17:51.439
It's from Joe.

17:54.439 --> 17:56.889
Oh, Jack. I don't know if I can do it.

17:59.939 --> 18:01.599
I can't, Jack.

18:01.689 --> 18:03.639
You read it.

18:14.389 --> 18:16.059
Jackie! Read it out loud.

18:16.139 --> 18:18.729
Well, I wanted to make sure
that there wasn't anything

18:18.809 --> 18:20.139
in it that would upset you, or...

18:20.229 --> 18:22.479
"Dear Colleen"...

18:22.559 --> 18:26.849
"Imagine a happy group of
morons carrying brick"...

18:28.809 --> 18:30.889
... "day in and day out.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.179
One day, one of the morons realizes

18:34.269 --> 18:36.809
he can't carry his bricks anymore,

18:36.889 --> 18:41.769
so another moron generously
takes on his load.

18:41.849 --> 18:44.889
We are the morons.

18:44.979 --> 18:48.559
I read that in a book once, Coll.

18:48.639 --> 18:52.229
I'm sorry you had to take
care of me all these years.

18:52.309 --> 18:54.889
The truth is, I've
been planning to do this

18:54.979 --> 18:59.099
since the second time I
got out of the hospital.

18:59.179 --> 19:01.269
But I selfishly wanted

19:01.349 --> 19:05.689
to spend more time with you.

19:05.769 --> 19:07.559
But you're free now.

20:17.019 --> 20:19.099
And I'm not talking about ones!

20:19.179 --> 20:20.889
All right, you're... 
you're almost there.

20:20.979 --> 20:23.455
You're almost there.
Whoo! There it goes.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.641
- Get it, Bridgette!
- A girls gotta live, right?

20:26.666 --> 20:28.689
Nah. You gonna get all my money, Bridge.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.769
Oh! Abuelita panties is on!

20:30.849 --> 20:32.935
- Granny panties!
- I got 20 for that. Yeah!

20:32.960 --> 20:34.943
Where's your money, huh?
Huh? Where's your money?

20:34.968 --> 20:37.639
Oh, but you're broke as fuck, huh?

20:37.729 --> 20:39.285
Yeah, you want some of this?

20:39.309 --> 20:41.639
I'm putting on a show for you.

20:41.729 --> 20:43.519
- Oh, yeah!
- You said you'd give me

20:43.599 --> 20:45.439
everything I need, right?

21:19.019 --> 21:20.689
Bridgette.

21:20.769 --> 21:22.229
Bridgette. Stop.

21:22.309 --> 21:24.939
Oh! Are you okay?

21:25.019 --> 21:27.439
Get the fuck away from me.

21:27.519 --> 21:29.729
A girl's gotta do what
she's gotta do, right?

21:29.809 --> 21:31.389
- Right.
- Who wants a dance?

21:31.479 --> 21:32.939
Stop it, Bridge.

21:33.019 --> 21:34.495
What? I'm just trying to make a living.

21:34.519 --> 21:37.309
I'm just trying to put
my kid through preschool.

21:37.389 --> 21:39.389
- Stop.
- What?

21:39.414 --> 21:41.374
- Bridgette, stop.
- You stop.

21:41.399 --> 21:42.455
- Stop it, Bridgette.
- Stop what?

21:42.479 --> 21:43.660
- Bridgette.
- Stop what?

21:43.685 --> 21:44.934
Oh, why? You wanna buy a ring

21:44.959 --> 21:46.210
instead of sending Larry to preschool?

21:46.234 --> 21:48.296
You want our kid not to
go to the good preschool...

21:48.349 --> 21:49.719
- Bridgette, you're drunk!
- So you can buy a fucking diamond ring?

21:49.743 --> 21:51.203
What the fuck was that? I just saw!

21:51.328 --> 21:52.983
- Stop it. You're drunk.
- I just fucking saw.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.207
- Turn that music off.
- Four thousand dollars?

21:55.240 --> 21:56.400
You're so fucked up.

21:56.425 --> 21:57.885
You're fucked up.

21:57.910 --> 21:59.910
Fuck you.

22:05.797 --> 22:07.507
- Hi!
- Hi.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.627
- This the bachelor party?
- They're inside.

22:09.717 --> 22:10.837
- Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.507
Hey!

22:12.587 --> 22:15.749
- Hey!
- Hey, baby.

22:15.828 --> 22:17.408
Feeling lucky today?

22:17.488 --> 22:19.328
Pick a card, any card.

22:19.408 --> 22:21.538
Why don't you pick a card? Don't be shy.

22:21.563 --> 22:23.358
Let me see what's under that pillow.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.973
- Oh, yeah!
- It's my lucky day.

22:25.998 --> 22:28.168
Oh, stop that shit. You
make me blush and shit.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.083
I'll see you later. Hey!

22:30.108 --> 22:31.698
No, thank you. I'm out.

22:31.788 --> 22:33.408
Bridgette?

22:33.488 --> 22:35.328
Oh, my God. Jill, hi!

22:35.353 --> 22:37.954
- Bridgette?
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

22:37.979 --> 22:39.502
- Oh, my God. What the fuck?
- You have no idea.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.276
I've had such a fucked up day.

22:42.095 --> 22:43.845
Oh, you guys, this is my friend Jill.

22:43.925 --> 22:46.175
We were in the same incest
survivors group in rehab.

22:46.255 --> 22:48.845
- Don't.
- It was just a workshop.

22:48.925 --> 22:51.215
I'm on the clock, so...

22:51.305 --> 22:53.129
time to dance for you guys, right?

22:53.154 --> 22:55.123
- Yeah!
- Are you ready for some dancing?

22:55.154 --> 22:57.349
- Ember!
- Empty those pockets!

22:57.374 --> 22:59.544
Who wants to see a sexy dance?

22:59.598 --> 23:02.098
- All right, Ember.
- Ember!

23:02.123 --> 23:04.703
You don't have to do it, you know.

23:05.215 --> 23:07.595
You don't have to get married.

23:07.675 --> 23:11.255
I mean, you're amazing.
You have this amazing career

23:11.345 --> 23:13.718
and you love what you're doing.

23:13.743 --> 23:14.874
And look at Winnie.

23:14.899 --> 23:17.070
She's saving all those street dogs

23:17.095 --> 23:20.255
and being gay.

23:20.345 --> 23:22.595
You have to make yourselves happy.

23:22.675 --> 23:24.095
Honestly.

23:26.135 --> 23:29.135
Is that my phone? Did
I... do you hear my phone?

23:29.215 --> 23:30.595
Yeah.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.505
Okay, I'm gonna go face with Dad.

23:33.595 --> 23:35.215
Facetime.

23:41.635 --> 23:44.305
So I've been thinking...

23:44.385 --> 23:45.965
we should kill Mom.

23:46.045 --> 23:47.805
Or...

23:47.885 --> 23:50.845
you could just get yourself
the fuck out of that dress.

23:55.845 --> 23:58.215
Don't be a fake.

24:33.135 --> 24:36.255
You're still here?

24:36.345 --> 24:38.175
Yeah, I have to stay out of the house

24:38.255 --> 24:40.925
until Nelson's mom leaves

24:41.005 --> 24:44.255
so I don't see her in her wedding dress.

24:44.345 --> 24:47.095
- Well, that's stupid.
- So stupid.

24:47.175 --> 24:50.555
So you just waited here?

24:50.635 --> 24:52.965
I'm so stupid.

24:53.045 --> 24:55.385
No, you're not.

24:55.465 --> 24:59.675
It's just a lot of money
to spend on nothing.

25:04.005 --> 25:06.345
Did you even look at the website?

25:06.425 --> 25:10.345
The preschool has telescopes
in every classroom.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.885
It's, like, state-of-the-art.

25:12.965 --> 25:15.845
Yeah, they got this whole science lab

25:15.925 --> 25:19.095
and this whole gymnasium
and, like, fields for days.

25:19.175 --> 25:22.135
They even do camping trips twice a year.

25:22.215 --> 25:24.045
They even have an elephant.

25:24.135 --> 25:26.345
- They have a elephant?
- Well, no,

25:26.425 --> 25:28.065
but... it's the type
of school that would.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.845
That would have an elephant.

25:29.925 --> 25:33.095
It's really cool.

25:33.175 --> 25:37.635
I want all that for Larry.

25:37.715 --> 25:40.385
I don't want him to be a fuckup like me.

25:49.345 --> 25:51.595
I want you to go to our wedding.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.885
You should be there.

26:10.385 --> 26:13.135
Bye, Rafi.

27:04.675 --> 27:07.005
Supahsmaht.
