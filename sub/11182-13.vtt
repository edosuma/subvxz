WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.305
* Well, we're movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:04.372 --> 00:07.208
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:07.275 --> 00:11.545
* To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.612 --> 00:14.615
* Movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:14.682 --> 00:17.785
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:17.851 --> 00:23.391
* We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.457 --> 00:26.026
* Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.094 --> 00:28.662
* Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.729 --> 00:31.265
* Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.332 --> 00:33.867
* Just to get up that hill

00:33.934 --> 00:36.470
* Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.537 --> 00:39.039
* Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.107 --> 00:41.542
* As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.609 --> 00:43.277
* There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.344 --> 00:46.080
* We're movin' on up
* Movin' on up

00:46.147 --> 00:49.117
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:49.183 --> 00:53.487

* Movin' on up

00:56.557 --> 00:59.560
* To the East Side
* Movin' on up

00:59.627 --> 01:04.064
* We finally got
a piece of the pie *

01:11.372 --> 01:14.475
One-third pineapple juice,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.677
and one-third rum.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.485
Hmm, better make that
one-fifth rum.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.758
Florence, what are you doing?

01:30.824 --> 01:32.626
I'm making punch
for the surprise party.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.362
But why are you
doing it now?
Weezy's still here.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.029
Well, you better get her
out of here.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.266
The Willis' and Mr. Bentley
will be down here
in a minute.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.534
Yeah, well I tried to
get her to go to the movies,
but she wouldn't do it.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.370
-Why not?
-Well, she said every time

01:42.436 --> 01:44.672
women go to the movies
by themselves, men are
always trying to pick them up.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.641
Hmm, yeah? Maybe I oughta
go to more movies.

01:47.708 --> 01:51.679
I can't wait to see the
expression on Weezy's face
when she sees her sister.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.715
That's right. She ain't
seen her sister in 30 years!
Has she?

01:54.782 --> 01:57.685
Right. And Weezy's always
complaining about me
not giving her no surprises.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.788
So when she sees Maxine
today, she can't say that
no more. (LAUGHS)

02:00.854 --> 02:03.357
You know, I've been
working for you for
almost four years,

02:03.424 --> 02:05.793
and this is the second
biggest surprise
I can think of.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.461
Oh, yeah? What's the first?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.930
-That I could put up with you
for four years.
-Oh...

02:10.731 --> 02:12.766
Oh, oh, Miss Jefferson!

02:12.833 --> 02:15.102
Weezy! Hey!
Hold it! Hold it!

02:15.169 --> 02:17.037
-What...
-Shh!

02:17.104 --> 02:18.806
What's wrong with Florence?

02:18.872 --> 02:21.675
-Shh! I don't want her
to find out.
-Find out what?

02:21.742 --> 02:25.413
Look... Uh, uh, look.
Today is Florence's
anniversary.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.982
Anniversary? Florence
isn't married.

02:29.049 --> 02:33.020
No, Weezy. Today is
the fourth anniversary of
Florence working for us.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.988
It is?

02:35.055 --> 02:37.625
Yeah, that's why
she's acting so funny.
She thinks we forgot.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.361
-We did.
-Maybe you did,
but I didn't.

02:40.428 --> 02:43.964
-You didn't?
-No. Poor Florence.
Nobody even got her anything.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.499
You mean a present?

02:45.566 --> 02:46.767
Hey, Weezy,
that's a great idea.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.068
Why don't you go out
and get her a present?

02:48.135 --> 02:49.737
Well, what should I get her?

02:49.803 --> 02:51.572
Look, shopping for
Florence should be easy.

02:51.639 --> 02:54.475
Just get something
for the woman who
has nothing. (LAUGHS)

02:55.576 --> 02:56.910
Louise... Oh!

02:56.977 --> 03:02.049
Oh, hi, Tom, Helen.
Well, those look delicious.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.817
What are they for?

03:03.884 --> 03:05.686
For? They're,
they're for, the, the...

03:05.753 --> 03:07.621
They're for the party!

03:07.688 --> 03:10.023
I thought the party
was a surprise.

03:10.090 --> 03:13.594
It is! Florence doesn't
know a thing about
the surprise party

03:13.661 --> 03:15.663
we're having
for Florence's anniversary.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.598
Florence's anniversary?

03:17.665 --> 03:20.368
Yes. She's been working
here four years today.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.802
Yes, Tom. Remember?

03:21.869 --> 03:24.538
That's why we're here,
for Florence's anniversary.

03:24.605 --> 03:30.778
Huh? Oh... Of course.
Oh, how can I be so stupid?

03:30.844 --> 03:31.912
It comes naturally.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.918
How come I don't know about
this surprise party?

03:37.985 --> 03:40.688
Well, I didn't tell you
because I didn't want
Florence to find out.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.790
George, I can keep a secret.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.292
No, you can't.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.726
You're always
telling everybody
how much you love me.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.194
George!

03:47.261 --> 03:49.463
Look, Weezy, will you hurry up
and go get Florence's present?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.732
But don't take too long.
You don't wanna
miss the party.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.838
Oh, that was a clever
idea, George,

03:57.905 --> 04:00.708
sending Louise out to buy
a present for Florence.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.175
A present for me?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.678
Yeah. I told Weezy
it was your anniversary.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.315
So act surprised when she
comes back with a bottle of
perfume or something.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.450
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
I didn't think you cared.

04:09.517 --> 04:12.052
I don't.

04:12.119 --> 04:15.289
-Okay now, let's get
set-up for the real surprise.
-Okay...

04:19.026 --> 04:20.661
Weezy! Hold it! Hold it!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.898
I left my wallet
in the bedroom.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.667
Don't worry, Weezy.
I want you to buy a cake.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.268
But I don't have any money.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.404
Oh, here, take my checkbook.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.406
-But, George, I...
-Florence will hear you!

04:32.473 --> 04:36.477
Oh, Mrs. J, you're home.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.913
Yes.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.784
Uh, well, now that I know
you're safe, I'm, uh, I'll...

04:49.423 --> 04:50.791
What was that all about?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.960
Who knows with Bentley?
Now get going, Weez.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.295
Come on, let's get...

04:55.363 --> 04:56.797
George, I'm so excited.

04:56.864 --> 05:00.468
Yes, George.
I think this surprise
is a wonderful idea!

05:00.534 --> 05:04.037
Well, you know,
when George Jefferson does
something, he does it big.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.907
I hope you remember that
the next time you write
my paycheck.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.910
(DOORBELL RINGS)

05:09.977 --> 05:11.278
Man, I hope that ain't
Weezy again.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.914
-Maybe it's Maxine.
-Who is it?

05:13.981 --> 05:17.418
MALE: It's Harry-hey
en-tlee Bay.

05:17.485 --> 05:21.154
-Oh, the door was op-flay.
-Look, Bentley, will you
cut the pig Latin?

05:21.221 --> 05:24.425
Oh, certainly. I have
some Gamay Rose.

05:24.492 --> 05:25.959
Bentley, I told you to
cut the pig Latin.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.597
Oh no, I did, Mr. J.
That's the name of
the wine. It's French.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.265
I brought it so that Mrs. J's
sister could feel at home.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.935
New York is her home.
She only lives in Paris.

05:35.002 --> 05:39.072
Ooh, I'd love to go to Paris.
I hear they call that
the city of romance.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.441
Oh, yeah?
Well, you better not go.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.942
You might give the city
a bad name.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.846
So when's Maxine
supposed to be here?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.881
Any minute.

05:47.948 --> 05:51.351
I can hardly wait.
Louise and Maxine are gonna
have so much to talk about.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.753
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I almost forgot.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.988
I found this old
photo album of Weezy's.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.257
It's got pictures of
Maxine and Weezy
when they were kids.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.492
See?

05:58.559 --> 06:04.064
Oh, look at Louise
in pigtails. Isn't she cute?

06:04.131 --> 06:07.535
I wonder if Mrs. J's sister
always wanted to be
a jazz singer?

06:07.601 --> 06:10.137
Well, they sure took
different paths in life.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.673
Not really. One sister
makes money with her mouth,

06:12.740 --> 06:14.675
and one sister married
a mouth who makes money.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.850
Is, is Maxine much like
your wife, Mr. J?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.217
I don't know.
I never met her.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.986
She left home
just before I met Weezy.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.521
Mmm. She must have
seen you coming.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.993
If you don't shut your mouth,
you're gonna be seen going.

06:33.060 --> 06:37.330
When Maxine called from Paris,
did she say why she decided
to come for a visit?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.467
Well, she said she had
a big surprise for Weezy.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.935
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Now, hope that ain't Weezy.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.507
It ain't.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.277
-Maxine?
-George?

06:50.343 --> 06:51.612
Maxine!

06:51.679 --> 06:56.116
George! Oh, it's so good
to see you.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.250
It's good to see you,
Maxine.

06:57.317 --> 07:01.021
Oh, just call me Maxie.
And I'll call you Mini.

07:03.991 --> 07:08.996
-Mini, that's funny.
-That's our maid, Florence.
She don't look like much,

07:09.062 --> 07:12.933
-and she does even less.
-Hi, Miss Mills.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.369
-Hello.
-And this is our neighbor,
Harry Bentley.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.106
-How do you do, Miss Mills?
-Enchantee!

07:19.172 --> 07:21.742
Hey, you hear that, Bentley?
She speaks pig Latin, too.

07:23.711 --> 07:27.748
-Hello. I'm Tom Willis.
And this is my wife, Helen.
-Bonjour, Maxine.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.750
Oh, you speak French!

07:29.817 --> 07:33.186
A little. Tom and I lived in
Paris for a couple of years,
right after we were married.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.456
Yes, the racial climate
was a little better
over there, you know.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.759
Oh, that's one of the
reasons I went there.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.794
Oh, you mean you married
a honky, too?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.330
No, I was never married.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.566
Oh, right.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.801
Hey, Florence, why don't you
put Maxine's bags away
before Louise gets here.

07:47.868 --> 07:48.902
Thank you.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.638
Oh, I'll help you, Florence.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.747
Well, where, where's Louise?

07:59.813 --> 08:01.314
I sent her out.
We wanna surprise her.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.951
-Oh, wonderful.
-Hey, how about
a drink, Maxie?

08:04.017 --> 08:08.556
Oh, I could use one.
You know, I forgot how
New York cabbies drive.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.124
Oh, la, la... Oh...

08:11.825 --> 08:12.993
How does bourbon sound?

08:13.060 --> 08:17.064
It sounds great.
In fact, let's hear it twice.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.767
Bourbon, bourbon,
you got it.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.769
George tells us that
you're a singer.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.606
Oh, yes, well some people
might disagree with him,
but I do all right.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.240
How did you get
started in that?

08:27.307 --> 08:31.812
I was born singing.
In fact, Louise and I
sang together a lot.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.080
Really?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.683
We had a very
original name for our act.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.686
We called ourselves
the Mills Sisters.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.521
Where did
the two of you perform?

08:41.589 --> 08:42.723
In the john.

08:45.593 --> 08:51.131
Our favorite song was
Georgia On My Mind,
Ray Charles. Look out!

08:52.566 --> 08:55.402
-Here you go, Maxie.
-Thanks, Mini.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.638
Now, what's the surprise
you got for Weezy?

08:57.705 --> 09:01.108
-Now if I told you,
it wouldn't be a surprise.
-Oh...

09:01.174 --> 09:03.577
But I do have a surprise
for you, too.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.313
-Oh, you do?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:08.782 --> 09:14.554
Ah! Voila! Magnifique.

09:16.924 --> 09:22.996
Hey, oui, oui,
mademoiselle. Fifi...
How do I look?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.499
-Like Toulouse-Lautrec.
-Only shorter.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.939
Oh, I say, Mr. J,
what an interesting chapeau.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.407
It ain't no chapeau, Bentley.
It's a hat.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.811
Direct from the Left Bank.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.614
You mean to tell me
they give away hats
in the banks of Paris?

09:40.681 --> 09:43.283
All they give away
in my bank is calendars.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.753
-George, what I mean
is that...
-Oh, Weezy.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.655
-Oh, quick, in here.
-Oh my...

09:47.721 --> 09:48.922
WEEZY: George!

09:48.989 --> 09:50.557
Oh, hold it, Weezy,
I think it's stuck.

09:50.624 --> 09:53.426
Oh, I'm so excited,
I can hardly stand it.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.963
Oh, Miss Jefferson's gonna
get the thrill of her life.

09:56.029 --> 09:57.430
Oh, hold it, Weezy.
I think I got it.

09:57.497 --> 10:02.135
What was wrong with the door?

10:02.202 --> 10:05.272
Come over here, Weezy.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.476
-Where you going?
-Here, Florence.
Happy anniversary.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.079
-Thank you.
-Oh, you got her a card.
That's nice.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.515
Now do what
Mr. Jefferson says.

10:15.582 --> 10:16.850
George, what's going on?

10:16.917 --> 10:19.019
Look, Weezy,
I got a confession to make.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.888
We're not having
a party for Florence.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.355
-We're not?
-Nope.

10:22.422 --> 10:26.359
-We're having a party for you!
-(ALL CHEERING)

10:26.426 --> 10:28.595
-For me?
-That's right, Miss Jefferson.

10:28.662 --> 10:33.701
That's wonderful. Why?

10:33.767 --> 10:37.570
Well, Weezy, look,
I want you to think back to
when you were a little girl.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.572
(VOCALIZING)

10:43.210 --> 10:45.779
There was someone special
in your life.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.247
Oh, I can't wait.

10:47.314 --> 10:52.152
Helen, please.
Someone very special.
Someone who...

10:52.219 --> 10:55.055
Willis, please.
Look, I know you
ain't gonna believe this,

10:55.122 --> 10:57.090
but that person is
right in this apartment.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.393
George, are you all crazy?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.996
No, no, Mrs. J,
we're quite serious.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.398
-I think I'm gonna burst!
-Not yet, Helen.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.403
Well, guess who it is,
Miss Jefferson!

11:10.470 --> 11:13.273
Is it someone I haven't
seen in a while?

11:13.340 --> 11:15.142
(COLLECTIVELY)
Yeah. Uh-huh.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.676
-Someone special?
-(COLLECTIVELY)
Uh-huh... Yeah...

11:16.744 --> 11:20.247
-Someone I knew in Harlem?
-You're getting warmer, girl!

11:20.313 --> 11:21.849
I have no idea.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.419
Weezy, it was somebody
you knew before you met me.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.588
Dennis Walker?

11:30.223 --> 11:31.324
Who?

11:31.391 --> 11:33.593
Dennis Walker.
My first boyfriend.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.729
I thought I was
your first boyfriend!

11:35.796 --> 11:38.799
-George, the surprise,
the surprise!
-Yeah...

11:38.866 --> 11:41.468
Oh, oh, yeah.
Okay, look, Weezy,
I'll give you a clue.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.671
Georgia.

11:44.738 --> 11:48.375
Georgia? I don't think I know
anybody named Georgia.

11:48.441 --> 11:54.114
* Georgia
Georgia

11:54.181 --> 11:58.051
* No peace I find

11:58.118 --> 12:02.856
-Oh, my God... Maxine!
-Louise!

12:02.923 --> 12:05.125
Oh, isn't this wonderful?

12:05.192 --> 12:08.095
I always cry at times
like this.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.130
Me, too...

12:13.801 --> 12:15.803
Well, Weezy, ain't you
gonna say something?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.642
Oh... I bet Weezy's
all choked up.

12:22.709 --> 12:24.277
I really
surprised her this time.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.820
Oh, Weezy, I know
just how you feel.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.554
Ain't it nice seeing
someone you love?

12:36.990 --> 12:40.160
Love? George,
I can't stand her!

12:42.529 --> 12:45.365
I want that woman
out of my house this minute!

12:54.774 --> 12:57.677
But, Weezy, your sister
came all the way from
Paris to surprise you.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.312
You're supposed to be happy!

12:59.379 --> 13:02.182
You wanna make me happy?
Ask her to leave.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.617
What? I don't believe this!
All the years
I've been knowing you,

13:04.684 --> 13:06.653
I never heard you say
a bad word about anybody.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.689
Okay, then I won't
say another word.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.559
Look, Weezy, that's your
sister sitting out there.
And you're telling me

13:12.625 --> 13:14.794
that you can't stand her?
Don't I get an explanation?

13:16.296 --> 13:19.799
Look, I'm sorry I yelled.

13:19.867 --> 13:23.703
Will you at least tell me
why you're mad at Maxine?

13:23.770 --> 13:26.406
Okay, damn it, then you
stay in the kitchen till
she leaves Monday morning.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.308
She came here
for the whole weekend?

13:28.375 --> 13:30.844
Yeah. We're putting her up
in Alan's room.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.580
-Why?
-Cause he's away
on a camping trip.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.984
I mean, why did she
come back
after all these years?

13:37.050 --> 13:38.685
Well, she said she had
a surprise for you.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.888
What kind of surprise?

13:40.954 --> 13:44.024
I don't know.
Damn, I don't know
nothing anymore!

13:44.091 --> 13:46.559
I try to do something
to make you happy, and
this is the thanks I get.

13:47.895 --> 13:50.430
No, you're right, George.
I'm sorry.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.765
Okay. Now tell me
what's wrong?

13:52.832 --> 13:56.469
Oh, it's nothing.
It's all in the past anyway.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.939
-Come on, George.
-That's my Weez.
I knew you'd come around.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.974
Oh, let's see a smile...

14:05.312 --> 14:06.880
There. How do I look?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.215
Like Jimmy Carter.

14:09.716 --> 14:13.586
Hey! Okay, let's get this
party on the way!

14:13.653 --> 14:17.090
Okay, Weezy, why don't you sit
right here beside your
wonderful sister?

14:17.157 --> 14:22.829
Yes, Louise. Now tell me
everything you've been doing.

14:22.896 --> 14:25.165
Oh, nothing much.

14:25.232 --> 14:29.102
Oh, my! Isn't this exciting?
You two have
so much to talk about.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.204
You hardly know
where to begin!

14:31.271 --> 14:32.572
Well, here's some
punch I made.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.174
This'll loosen up
your tongues.

14:34.241 --> 14:38.045
Mmm-hmm.
If you made it, it'll probably
loosen up their teeth.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.616
(CLEARS THROAT) May I have
your attention, please?

14:43.683 --> 14:46.486
I'd like to propose a toast.

14:46.553 --> 14:49.889
-To, Maxine.
-May she enjoy
her stay here in New York.

14:49.957 --> 14:51.658
I'll drink to that.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.195
To Mrs. J, may she always
remember the joy
of this reunion

14:55.262 --> 14:56.663
I'll drink to that.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.732
And to George,
Louise's
wonderful husband.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.368
You all can drink to that.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.339
(ALL CHOKING)

15:27.160 --> 15:30.197
I, I, I've never tasted
punch like that before.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.965
Oh, well, let me
get you some more.

15:32.032 --> 15:40.040
No! I'll just fix myself
a drink, and save
the punch for everyone else.

15:40.107 --> 15:44.544
Oh! Hey, Maxine,
here's something that might
bring back some memories.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.480
Oh, pictures. Good!

15:47.547 --> 15:51.218
Good idea, George.
Tom and I love to look
through our family album.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.120
Oh, yes, we've got some
great pictures.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.722
They can't be that great.
All your pictures
are in black and white.

15:58.525 --> 16:03.463
Do you believe
I don't have one single
picture of us together.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.964
Yes, I'd believe it.

16:05.032 --> 16:08.535
Oh, look, Louise and I in
the church choir.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.803
Oh, what lovely choir robes.

16:10.870 --> 16:15.942
Yes. Louise made ours
all by herself.
Remember, Louise?

16:16.009 --> 16:19.612
Yes, I remember.
All by myself.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.415
And you were always
so great at sewing.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.518
Well, I had plenty of
time to practice.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.754
You know, while you were
at dancing class.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.524
-Oh, you dance, too?
-Of course she can dance.

16:31.591 --> 16:35.628
With all the money Mama
spent on her classes.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.499
I had a great uncle who
was a professional dancer.
He was quite famous in London.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.702
-Really?
-Yes, well, actually
he was famous

16:42.769 --> 16:45.705
for having once danced
naked in Trafalgar Square.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.841
What happened to him?

16:48.908 --> 16:52.745
Oh, he was arrested,
and the magistrate
had him incarcerated.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.247
Oh, that must have hurt.

16:57.484 --> 17:03.056
Here. This is me
the night Duke Ellington
played at the Savoy Ballroom.

17:03.123 --> 17:06.093
Oh my, you look lovely!

17:06.159 --> 17:08.961
I bet you had a lot of fun
that night, Miss Jefferson.

17:09.028 --> 17:14.434
Oh, I didn't go.
Maxine was the only one
who had an evening gown.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.669
Uh, Weezy, can I see you
in the kitchen a minute?

17:16.736 --> 17:19.106
We'll be right back.
You all just go ahead
and have fun.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.241
Oh, yes, by all means,
have fun.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.844
What are you doing?

17:24.911 --> 17:26.879
I was being nice
to my sister.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.481
Nice? You call that
being nice?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.783
"Maxine was the only one
who had an evening gown."

17:32.619 --> 17:34.887
It was the truth and
Maxine knows it.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.590
Weezy, I'm ashamed
of the way you're
treating your sister.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.326
Me? What about her?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.527
She thinks you're great!

17:40.593 --> 17:43.463
Oh, yeah?
Then why did she...

17:46.566 --> 17:48.368
Why did she what?

17:50.002 --> 17:51.704
Why did she what?

17:51.771 --> 17:53.773
Why did she run away?

17:53.840 --> 17:56.243
Run away? What are you
talking about?
She's sitting right out there.

17:56.309 --> 17:59.512
I don't mean now.
I mean, 30 years ago.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.415
She just took off
like a shot! Disappeared.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.118
Didn't even have the decency
to say goodbye.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.454
And who was the one left to
take care of Mama,

18:07.520 --> 18:12.825
struggle through high school,
work weekends to help pay
the bills? Me! That's who!

18:12.892 --> 18:15.428
And while I was working
my butt off at home,

18:15.495 --> 18:19.065
she was having the time of
her life in Paris!

18:19.132 --> 18:21.201
How come you never
told me this before?

18:21.268 --> 18:26.973
Well, there was no reason to.
And I didn't think
I'd ever see Maxine again.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.477
If I had known all that
I would have told her to stay
in Paris where she belongs.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.078
Where are you going?

18:32.145 --> 18:35.682
I'm gonna throw that jazz
jive singer out the door.

18:35.748 --> 18:40.787
Wait a minute.
Maybe it would be best
to let sleeping dogs lie.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.922
No way. That dog ain't
sleeping in my house.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.927
Okay. But let me tell her.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.129
Okay. But look,
if you don't, I will.

18:54.501 --> 18:59.071
This, this is me singing
at the Apollo Theater
on Amateur Night.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.909
Louise, I never knew
your sister sang
at the Apollo Theater.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.011
There are a lot of things
you don't know about
Weezy's sister.

19:05.077 --> 19:06.846
Go on, tell her, Weez.

19:06.913 --> 19:10.450
-Later, George, not with
everyone here.
-Oh, right.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.084
Hey! You know,
I just realized something.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.354
Now, Weezy hasn't seen
her sister in a long time.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.955
Maybe we should
leave them alone.

19:16.022 --> 19:18.225
I think they'd like to talk
about the good old days.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.260
Oh, oh, of course.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.962
Oh, he's right.
You two must have
an awful lot to catch up on.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.832
-Maxine, we'll see you later.
-Yes. Au revoir.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.701
-Au revoir.
-Au revoir.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.103
Well, now let's see...
Where were we, Maxine?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.105
Florence, what are you doing?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.874
I like hearing about
the good old days.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.709
Then go in your room
and read your diary!

19:40.046 --> 19:45.718
Well... Hmm, some
anniversary present.
Au revoir.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.324
Well, Weezy, do your stuff.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.526
-Uh, George, I...
-You want me to do it?

19:53.593 --> 19:58.130
Louise, I knew that
after all these years,
it might be awkward.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.232
Awkward?
Now listen, Maxine...

19:59.299 --> 20:00.633
Uh, George, ferme ta bouche.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.536
Look, don't try to
sweet talk me.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.105
George, ferme ta bouche
means shut up.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.381
Louise, the only
reason I came,

20:14.447 --> 20:18.385
was because I have
something very special
to share with you.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.187
So if there's anything
bothering you,
please, tell me.

20:23.656 --> 20:26.393
Come on, Louise.
We're sisters.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.862
And it's time we stopped
keeping things from
each other.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.398
She's right.

20:31.464 --> 20:34.467
Uh, there is something.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.403
But it's hard for me to say.

20:36.469 --> 20:40.072
Mama always said
you did have trouble
speaking your mind.

20:40.139 --> 20:43.042
-How would you know
what Mama said?
-That's telling her, Weezy!

20:46.245 --> 20:50.450
Okay, lady, you asked for it.
I want you to know...

20:50.517 --> 20:52.251
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Maxine Mills.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.820
Jason! Darling!

20:56.656 --> 21:02.028
Louise, this is my surprise.
I want you to meet Jason.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.431
You haven't changed
a bit, Maxine.

21:04.497 --> 21:08.100
I suppose your surprise is
that the two of you
are getting married.

21:08.167 --> 21:11.203
(LAUGHS) No,
we're not
getting married.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.206
I see. Living together?

21:14.273 --> 21:18.110
Hmm. Not any longer.
Jason lives in Washington now.

21:18.177 --> 21:21.681
He just drove up to be
with me over the weekend.

21:21.748 --> 21:24.351
I'm surprised at you.
She's old enough
to be your mother.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.354
She is my mother.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.323
She's what?

21:30.390 --> 21:32.425
You told me
you'd never been married.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.060
I haven't.

21:34.126 --> 21:38.798
Mom told me a lot of
wonderful things
about you, Aunt Louise.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.801
And you must be Uncle George.
It's nice to meet you.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.840
But I don't understand.

21:47.907 --> 21:52.545
Louise,
I've wanted to tell you
since I ran away from home.

21:52.612 --> 21:56.082
But it's taken me 30 years
to work up the courage.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.986
The reason I left home
when I did was
because I was pregnant.

22:02.121 --> 22:03.890
Yes, Louise.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.726
Why didn't you tell us?

22:06.793 --> 22:08.528
I was too ashamed.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.497
But you could have come to me.

22:10.563 --> 22:14.200
As the older sister,
I was supposed to
set the good example.

22:14.266 --> 22:17.604
-Maxine...
-But instead it was you who
got the good grades in school,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.205
helped out at home.

22:19.271 --> 22:23.175
You did everything
just right.
And what did I do?

22:23.242 --> 22:25.211
I got myself pregnant.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.314
Hey, Mom, don't be
so hard on yourself.

22:28.381 --> 22:32.652
Aunt Louise,
my mother worked
every night in those clubs

22:32.719 --> 22:35.054
just to put me
through law school.

22:35.121 --> 22:39.058
And she raised me
better than anyone else
could have.

22:42.962 --> 22:45.064
Isn't your nephew
something, Louise?

22:45.965 --> 22:48.901
He certainly is.

22:48.968 --> 22:52.539
Now, was there something
you wanted to say, Louise?

22:53.305 --> 22:54.407
Say?

22:58.177 --> 23:03.382
Oh, yes. I just want to say...

23:04.316 --> 23:07.319
I'm glad we're sisters again.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.200
Welcome to the family, Jason.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.535
Thanks, Uncle George.

23:22.602 --> 23:25.037
Oh, you can call me
Uncle Mini.

23:26.806 --> 23:30.743
Oh way! This gift
certificate makes this
the best present of my life!

23:30.810 --> 23:33.112
-What gift certificate?
-For my anniversary present.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.114
What are you talking about?
What did you give her anyway?

23:35.181 --> 23:38.851
Exactly what my room needs.
A new color T.V. set!

23:40.419 --> 23:43.089
But, George,
you're the one who said
to get her something.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.091
I didn't mean
that kind of something!

23:47.026 --> 23:49.161
Boy, I can hardly wait
till two months from now.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.898
-Two months from now for what?
-That's my real anniversary.

24:25.565 --> 24:30.436
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:30.503 --> 24:33.540
