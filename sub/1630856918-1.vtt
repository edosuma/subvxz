WEBVTT

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:48.525
Uh, Sweden.

00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:51.994
I'm... I'm... Swedish

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:53.764
but I speak a little English.

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:54.831
We're coming on board.

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:05.108
All are welcome.
All are welcome.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.279
Even the little one.
He can come too.

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:10.748
Welcome.

00:02:16.084 --> 00:02:18.085
Why are you here?

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:19.921
Just a little sailing holiday.

00:02:19.922 --> 00:02:21.136
A jolly boys trip.

00:02:21.137 --> 00:02:22.351
Take your hands off.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400
Papers?

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:28.761
Passport?

00:02:31.331 --> 00:02:33.128
Here you go.

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:39.970
Any other people on the boat?

00:02:40.945 --> 00:02:42.137
Just the two of us.

00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:45.613
Nein.

00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:50.118
Come, come,
we have lots to eat...

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.045
Take your dirty hands off me!

00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:54.561
Back off!

00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:58.488
And you,

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.630
put your hands in the air!

00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:13.810
Ooh!

00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.491
You're in trouble now!

00:03:15.492 --> 00:03:17.172
You've been a naughty boy!

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.444
I'll give you 100 francs
to shoot him.

00:03:22.445 --> 00:03:23.512
Don't shoot me!

00:03:25.454 --> 00:03:28.685
He hates Germans.
You should really shoot him.

00:03:28.787 --> 00:03:32.259
I... I'm sorry.
You are very scary.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.696
Make him walk the plank.

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.029
He loves wood.

00:03:39.168 --> 00:03:41.372
Dirty drunken animal!

00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:44.339
Guilty as charged.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:00.848
I always take
a can of kerosene

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.459
for just
these sort of occasions.

00:04:05.061 --> 00:04:06.525
It's been a while,

00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:08.525
but the last time
someone laughed at me

00:04:08.526 --> 00:04:10.097
when I boarded their vessel,

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.967
I gave them the choice.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.863
Either swim to shore

00:04:13.864 --> 00:04:16.531
or take their chances
on a burning ship.

00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:21.978
Hans and I wondered
which option they'd choose,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.877
death by water or death by fire.

00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:27.451
Oddly, they chose both.

00:04:35.692 --> 00:04:37.225
They waited
until the very last moment,

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:38.726
until their hair was on fire,

00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:43.927
and their blistered skin
peeled from their fingers,

00:04:43.928 --> 00:04:46.528
before they immersed
themselves in water

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:47.936
in the vain hope

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:49.341
of reaching shore.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.838
One of them

00:04:52.869 --> 00:04:54.903
sank immediately and perished.

00:04:54.904 --> 00:04:57.272
But to our amazement,
the big one,

00:04:58.775 --> 00:04:59.775
he showed great spirit.

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:02.752
In spite of all the odds...

00:05:04.288 --> 00:05:06.188
...he painstakingly
made it to shore.

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.555
We followed and cheered him on

00:05:08.556 --> 00:05:11.154
and rewarded
this impressive achievement

00:05:12.326 --> 00:05:13.326
with a bullet

00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:16.467
to the back of his head.

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:20.399
Isn't that funny?

00:05:21.908 --> 00:05:22.908
Why aren't you laughing?

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:12.589
Nice work, Lassen.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:15.778
There's more
where that came from.

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:17.729
Yes.

00:06:24.362 --> 00:06:25.364
Ah...

00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:28.405
Not sure it's working, Lassen.

00:06:29.572 --> 00:06:31.366
The captain
looks rather agitated.

00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:38.640
They're bringing their guns
to bear.

00:06:43.014 --> 00:06:44.912
They'll find their range
soon, sir.

00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:46.984
Freddy, should we be worried?

00:06:46.985 --> 00:06:48.956
Oh, I don't think so, sir.

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.692
It's a rather large explosive,
so I set a rather large fuse.

00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:53.931
I located the outside
of the powder room,

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:55.065
so when it goes bang,

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:56.294
it really should go bang.

00:06:59.223 --> 00:07:00.631
Closer...

00:07:00.632 --> 00:07:01.968
Should be any second now, chaps.

00:07:07.604 --> 00:07:08.835
Freddy?

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:15.410
Good work, Frederick.

00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:17.747
Thank you, Captain.

00:07:17.849 --> 00:07:18.904
Now, any chance you can tell us

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:19.985
what we're doing here, sir?

00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:32.164
The war in Europe rages on

00:07:32.165 --> 00:07:35.601
as Hitler and his Nazi horde
sweep aside all in their path.

00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:38.266
Poland, Belgium and now France

00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:41.510
have all fallen
to Hitler's fascist regime,

00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:43.694
leaving Britain
holding up the final hopes

00:07:43.695 --> 00:07:45.878
of liberation
for all of Europe.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:48.416
So, come on, Blighty,
get ready for a fighty.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:50.420
But we cannot do it alone.

00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:52.436
And any hope
for our American brothers

00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:54.453
to join us
from across the Atlantic

00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:56.019
remains frustrated

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.857
by Germany's secret weapon,
the U-boat.

00:07:58.858 --> 00:08:01.694
These deadly little submarines

00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:03.557
hunt at will
in the North Atlantic.

00:08:03.558 --> 00:08:07.295
Undetectable, the U-boat
sinks ships indiscriminately,

00:08:07.296 --> 00:08:10.074
whether carrying
munitions, provisions

00:08:10.075 --> 00:08:11.705
or civilians heading

00:08:11.706 --> 00:08:13.905
from our companions
across the pond.

00:08:13.906 --> 00:08:16.641
So long as the U-boats
rule the Atlantic,

00:08:16.642 --> 00:08:18.109
it remains impossible

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.980
for America's brave troops
to reach our shores.

00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:24.185
Will Britain be forced
to appease Hitler's plans

00:08:24.186 --> 00:08:27.037
or face devastation
from his offensive?

00:08:27.038 --> 00:08:29.889
London burns
and her seas run red,

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.921
as bombs from above
and torpedoes from below

00:08:32.922 --> 00:08:34.488
grind the Brits down.

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:37.300
And with no defense
against these lethal U-boats,

00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:39.253
it appears all hope may be lost

00:08:39.254 --> 00:08:41.206
for peace in Europe.

00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:46.501
The Germans cut off
our supply chain with U-boats,

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:50.406
we cut off the supply chain
to the U-boats.

00:08:51.976 --> 00:08:53.256
Through our intelligence agents,

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:54.647
we've found a way.

00:08:59.717 --> 00:09:01.589
The entire

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.923
servicing, repairing,
and rearming

00:09:04.924 --> 00:09:07.794
of Hitler's
Atlantic U-boat fleet...

00:09:07.795 --> 00:09:10.632
is operated
by two Nazi tug boats...

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:13.704
and an Italian supply ship
in Fernando Po.

00:09:13.806 --> 00:09:18.673
I need men who are willing
to go and sink those ships.

00:09:18.674 --> 00:09:20.869
Why don't we just
air-raid Fernando Po

00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.044
and sink the ships?

00:09:23.778 --> 00:09:28.311
Because crafty Germans,
being crafty Germans,

00:09:28.312 --> 00:09:30.784
have positioned themselves
in a Spanish colony.

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:33.068
Fernando Po
is neutral territory.

00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:35.351
If we attack that colony,

00:09:35.352 --> 00:09:37.890
the rest of unoccupied Europe
will join the Nazis,

00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:39.060
and it's only
a question of time

00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:40.229
before we find ourselves

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.693
frying big pink sausages

00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:42.934
wearing nothing but lederhosen.

00:09:44.767 --> 00:09:46.770
Hitler is not
playing by the rules

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:48.602
and neither are we.

00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:52.310
This will of course be
an unsanctioned,

00:09:52.412 --> 00:09:53.975
unauthorized
and unofficial mission.

00:09:56.207 --> 00:09:57.907
If they're captured
by the British,

00:09:58.009 --> 00:09:59.049
they'll be thrown in jail.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:02.040
But if the Nazis find them...

00:10:04.883 --> 00:10:06.053
it's torture and death.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.222
Somewhat contentiously,

00:10:09.223 --> 00:10:10.854
I may have just the man,

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.686
but rather inconveniently,

00:10:12.687 --> 00:10:15.260
he's currently incarcerated
at His Majesty's pleasure.

00:10:16.435 --> 00:10:17.595
We may not like his attitude,

00:10:18.436 --> 00:10:20.595
but he's bold, he's a killer,

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:24.246
and the men
will follow him anywhere.

00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:27.470
Are we sure this is a good idea?

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:30.861
Of course we're not.

00:10:30.862 --> 00:10:32.244
But we're desperate.

00:10:33.584 --> 00:10:35.218
Send him in.

00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:36.685
Forward!

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.980
Stand there, Major.

00:10:54.637 --> 00:10:55.637
Thank you, Sergeant.

00:11:00.477 --> 00:11:01.707
Gus March-Phillips,

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:02.873
this is Lieutenant Commander...

00:11:02.874 --> 00:11:05.339
Fleming. Ian Fleming.

00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:06.777
He used to be
at Naval Intelligence,

00:11:06.778 --> 00:11:07.780
now he works for me.

00:11:11.157 --> 00:11:12.753
Why am I here, M?

00:11:12.754 --> 00:11:15.358
I have a mission
I want you to lead.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.495
Why are you asking me, M?

00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:19.936
Help yourself
to a cup of tea, Major.

00:11:33.675 --> 00:11:36.847
We both know that I'm...

00:11:38.947 --> 00:11:42.850
not very popular
with the administration.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.215
The reason
they find you unattractive

00:11:45.317 --> 00:11:47.990
is the very reason
I find you attractive.

00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:50.491
Mission?

00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:52.153
Operation Postmaster.

00:11:52.154 --> 00:11:53.593
To neutralize the German U-boats

00:11:53.695 --> 00:11:54.695
in the North Atlantic.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.372
And, uh, what's the plan?

00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:04.070
The U-boats need

00:12:04.071 --> 00:12:05.769
- fuel and torpedoes.
- Oh.

00:12:05.871 --> 00:12:06.939
But they also need

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.538
carbon dioxide filters
for oxygen.

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:11.499
Without them, they can't dive
and they can't hunt.

00:12:12.817 --> 00:12:14.379
Stuck on the surface,
they're obsolete.

00:12:18.882 --> 00:12:20.521
Target?

00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:22.386
The Duchessa d'Aosta.

00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:24.526
She's an Italian ship
the Germans have been using...

00:12:30.964 --> 00:12:33.262
...to refuel,
re-arm and replenish

00:12:33.364 --> 00:12:36.035
the CO2 filters
for the entire fleet.

00:12:36.036 --> 00:12:38.741
She's hidden
off the coast of West Africa.

00:12:38.742 --> 00:12:41.379
A small island
called Fernando Po.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.980
We want you to, um, sink her.

00:12:43.981 --> 00:12:46.582
You'll be posing as fishermen

00:12:46.583 --> 00:12:48.015
sailing down the west coast

00:12:48.016 --> 00:12:49.716
on board a trawler
loaded with enough explosives

00:12:49.717 --> 00:12:51.818
to destroy the Duchessa.

00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:54.218
This is Agents
Heron and Stewart.

00:12:54.219 --> 00:12:57.023
They'll be working
undercover on the island.

00:12:57.024 --> 00:12:58.594
Mr. Heron's
already established there,

00:12:58.595 --> 00:13:00.460
running various businesses.

00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:02.028
What businesses?

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:05.463
A casino bar,
and illegal exports game.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.901
Profitable?

00:13:07.902 --> 00:13:09.839
I do quite well.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.404
High-ranking Nazis
are my most valued clients.

00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:13.971
Good for you.

00:13:17.573 --> 00:13:19.508
Miss Stewart,
an actress and singer,

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:21.416
has been training with us
for the last two years.

00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:22.617
She'll be posing

00:13:22.618 --> 00:13:24.280
as a gold trader from New York.

00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:26.119
Her mission is
to seduce and distract

00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:28.120
the island's Commanding
Officer Heinrich Luhr.

00:13:28.222 --> 00:13:30.994
She's very capable
and somewhat motivated.

00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:33.860
Motivated how, sir?

00:13:33.963 --> 00:13:35.867
My mother's side
were German Jews.

00:13:37.602 --> 00:13:39.019
They were the first to go.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.475
Very sorry to hear that.

00:13:40.476 --> 00:13:41.932
I'm sure you'll recover.

00:13:41.933 --> 00:13:43.706
We have 44 days

00:13:43.808 --> 00:13:45.673
before the Nazis
move their operation.

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:46.801
We won't find them again.

00:13:50.508 --> 00:13:53.059
If I'm to do this,
I'll need my own team.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.612
You won't like them.
They're all, uh...

00:13:58.256 --> 00:14:00.086
mad.

00:14:00.087 --> 00:14:02.817
They'll need to be.
Give us their names.

00:14:06.694 --> 00:14:08.062
Henry Hayes.

00:14:08.063 --> 00:14:11.601
A smart, young Irishman
who hates the Nazis

00:14:11.602 --> 00:14:12.997
because his older brother,

00:14:12.998 --> 00:14:15.268
who was a close friend of mine,

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:18.170
drowned after a U-boat
sank his fishing trawler.

00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:21.072
I've taken him under my wing
ever since.

00:14:21.073 --> 00:14:23.138
He's cunning, quiet and wily.

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:24.506
More to the point,

00:14:24.507 --> 00:14:27.347
Hayes is a magnificent sailor
and I trust him.

00:14:28.888 --> 00:14:31.282
If we're going
to try and sink a large ship,

00:14:31.283 --> 00:14:34.454
we'll need
Freddy "The Buzz" frogman.

00:14:34.455 --> 00:14:37.492
He can swim across the channel
with his feet tied together.

00:14:37.493 --> 00:14:39.292
Admittedly,

00:14:39.293 --> 00:14:41.028
he's a convicted arsonist
and a terrible misery

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:43.096
unless he's destroying something.

00:14:43.097 --> 00:14:45.497
But he's very good
at blowing things up.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.336
Next, we'll need
the Danish hammer.

00:14:50.508 --> 00:14:52.508
Anders Lassen.

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:53.777
Grew up wrestling bears

00:14:53.778 --> 00:14:55.511
and hunting elk
on his family estate.

00:14:55.512 --> 00:14:56.780
He's a legend

00:14:56.781 --> 00:14:58.981
with a Bowie knife
and a bow and arrow.

00:14:58.982 --> 00:15:01.182
He ran away at 18
to fight the Nazis

00:15:01.183 --> 00:15:03.968
after the Gestapo tortured
his brother to death.

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:06.754
He gave up filleting game
for gutting Nazis.

00:15:06.856 --> 00:15:08.624
He then turned up on our shores

00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:10.622
ready to fight alongside us.

00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:12.559
He is an uncontrollable mad dog

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.496
who knows
a hundred creative ways

00:15:14.497 --> 00:15:15.593
to kill a man.

00:15:16.698 --> 00:15:18.397
And finally,

00:15:18.398 --> 00:15:21.401
and most importantly,
we'll need Geoffrey Appleyard.

00:15:22.542 --> 00:15:25.409
Yes, we thought you might.

00:15:25.511 --> 00:15:27.306
That's why we sent him

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:28.741
on a reconnaissance mission
to Fernando Po.

00:15:28.742 --> 00:15:29.812
Unfortunately,

00:15:29.914 --> 00:15:31.344
the Nazis nabbed him
on his return.

00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:34.546
All the more reason.
He knows what we need to know.

00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:36.985
He's a master planner,

00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:40.623
a master survivor,
a chess grand master

00:15:40.725 --> 00:15:42.092
and a surgeon with the blade.

00:15:44.921 --> 00:15:48.759
We spent two weeks together
in a Dunkirk foxhole

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.926
and if it wasn't for Apple,
I would still be there today.

00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:54.929
No Apple, no mission.

00:15:55.806 --> 00:15:57.174
I'm afraid that's impossible.

00:15:57.175 --> 00:15:58.201
Why?

00:15:58.202 --> 00:16:00.338
Because he's being held

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:03.006
by an entire German garrison
on La Palma.

00:16:05.947 --> 00:16:07.483
La Palma's on the way.

00:16:08.945 --> 00:16:10.865
- That's insanity.
- You let me worry about that.

00:16:14.761 --> 00:16:16.852
I must get me
one of those coats.

00:16:44.789 --> 00:16:45.955
Now, any chance you can tell us

00:16:45.956 --> 00:16:47.121
what we're doing here, sir?

00:16:47.122 --> 00:16:49.288
Dry yourself off, frogman,
and I'll tell you.

00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:51.359
The curiosity is
eating us all up, sir.

00:16:55.628 --> 00:16:57.662
I apologize
for all the secrecy, chaps.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.170
But this is

00:17:00.272 --> 00:17:05.532
an unsanctioned, unofficial
and unauthorized mission.

00:17:05.634 --> 00:17:07.302
If we're picked up by the Brits,

00:17:07.303 --> 00:17:08.305
we will all go to jail.

00:17:10.212 --> 00:17:11.877
If we're picked up
by the Germans,

00:17:11.979 --> 00:17:13.007
torture and death.

00:17:15.118 --> 00:17:16.422
So, it's just
the four of us then?

00:17:16.446 --> 00:17:18.714
And Captain Appleyard.

00:17:18.816 --> 00:17:21.650
He's responsible
for securing this information.

00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:24.928
He is, however,
in a spot of bother.

00:17:24.929 --> 00:17:27.765
He is being held
by the Germans on La Palma.

00:17:27.867 --> 00:17:29.294
Our first job
is to liberate him.

00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:30.935
- Oh, so, that's all, is it?
- No.

00:17:31.037 --> 00:17:33.002
We need to confirm
Appleyard's intelligence.

00:17:33.003 --> 00:17:34.731
That's why
there are two more agents

00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:37.299
on their way to Fernando Po
by train, as we speak.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.769
Doing what, exactly?

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.240
They'll be ensuring

00:17:40.342 --> 00:17:42.375
that those ships
are filled with supplies,

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.445
so they're worth blowing up
in the first place.

00:17:49.484 --> 00:17:52.385
It's one thing
taking over the world,

00:17:52.487 --> 00:17:54.287
but do they have to
take over the kitchen too?

00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:58.961
It's all sausage,
cabbage and black bread.

00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:00.791
Who would
you have preferred?

00:18:00.893 --> 00:18:04.627
The French offer
the refined classical take.

00:18:04.628 --> 00:18:08.202
Cote de boeuf,
fromage, le beurre...

00:18:08.203 --> 00:18:10.536
ca suffit!

00:18:10.537 --> 00:18:13.067
What about the rustic
spontaneity of the Italians?

00:18:14.772 --> 00:18:19.214
Their oils, the linguine,
the tomatoes.

00:18:19.215 --> 00:18:21.717
I'd climb over the linguine
to get to the fettucine.

00:18:21.718 --> 00:18:23.348
But the cinghiale.

00:18:23.349 --> 00:18:24.980
Mmm.

00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:27.785
You have me with the wild boar.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.693
But then again,
the Spanish offer

00:18:31.694 --> 00:18:32.994
the smorgasbord

00:18:33.097 --> 00:18:36.360
of the regional paella
and tapas.

00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:38.565
And Jamon Iberico Andalucia.

00:18:39.537 --> 00:18:41.729
So?

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.103
We're between
a rock and a hard place.

00:18:44.104 --> 00:18:45.632
If the Brits win the war,

00:18:45.734 --> 00:18:47.101
we're stuck with fish and chips.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:49.190
If the Germans win the war,

00:18:50.915 --> 00:18:52.315
we're stuck with this menu.

00:18:53.485 --> 00:18:54.515
So?

00:18:56.318 --> 00:18:58.292
We'll have the sausage,
the cabbage

00:18:58.293 --> 00:19:00.267
and the black bread please.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.320
Tres bien. Merci.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:20.810
Our situation?

00:19:21.612 --> 00:19:22.972
Steady.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:33.719
Steady.

00:19:40.994 --> 00:19:42.156
Now.

00:19:54.977 --> 00:19:56.005
Mmm.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.016
I'm exhausted.

00:20:24.843 --> 00:20:26.409
Entschuldigung, bitte.

00:20:35.085 --> 00:20:36.165
Halt!

00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:53.613
Is there a problem?

00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:06.234
I can manage
myself, thank you.

00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:10.785
Allow me, Miss Stewart.

00:21:25.365 --> 00:21:26.365
Allow me.

00:21:26.903 --> 00:21:27.936
Thank you.

00:21:29.769 --> 00:21:31.600
Prost!

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:48.788
Door.

00:21:49.958 --> 00:21:50.988
Locked.

00:21:57.835 --> 00:21:59.235
Case?

00:21:59.236 --> 00:22:00.637
Working on it.

00:22:25.931 --> 00:22:26.931
Sir, contact.

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:30.324
Contact.

00:22:30.967 --> 00:22:32.128
Standing by.

00:22:37.408 --> 00:22:39.538
Duchessa's manifest. Ready?

00:22:39.539 --> 00:22:41.669
- Ready.
- 400 B-grade torpedoes. Check.

00:22:44.575 --> 00:22:46.408
400 B-grade torpedoes.

00:22:46.409 --> 00:22:47.593
Check.

00:22:47.594 --> 00:22:48.778
Check.

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:50.610
5,000 tons of diesel. Check.

00:22:54.618 --> 00:22:56.257
5,000 tons of diesel.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.154
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir?

00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:58.424
Check.

00:22:58.527 --> 00:23:00.097
Check.

00:23:00.199 --> 00:23:02.164
10,000 carbon dioxide filters.
Check.

00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:06.360
End of message from Stork, sir.

00:23:07.004 --> 00:23:08.334
Confirm receipt.

00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:10.808
Receipt confirmed.

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:12.207
Urgent, Chequers.

00:23:12.208 --> 00:23:14.636
Get the car ready.
Inform Fleming.

00:23:14.637 --> 00:23:15.639
Let's pack it up.

00:23:17.247 --> 00:23:18.443
No point robbing the bank

00:23:18.545 --> 00:23:20.115
if there's no gold in the vault.

00:23:27.023 --> 00:23:28.057
Thank you.

00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:29.358
It's truly comforting to know

00:23:29.359 --> 00:23:31.187
there's at least one gentleman
in the world.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.100
Ah!
Idiot!

00:23:37.398 --> 00:23:38.634
Good day.

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:56.454
Sausage, cabbage
and black bread.

00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:04.356
Hitler
has made us an offer.

00:24:04.357 --> 00:24:05.688
An appeasement.

00:24:05.689 --> 00:24:07.693
But we must step down our army,

00:24:07.694 --> 00:24:10.825
surrender our Navy
and accept Nazi rule.

00:24:10.826 --> 00:24:12.765
Otherwise, he promises

00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:16.565
total destruction of Britain
and her empire.

00:24:16.566 --> 00:24:18.538
Our best option

00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:20.610
is to take Hitler's deal
while we can.

00:24:22.245 --> 00:24:24.347
The Air Marshal agrees.

00:24:24.348 --> 00:24:28.942
He has more bombs,
more men, more machines.

00:24:29.044 --> 00:24:30.981
We won't survive much longer.

00:24:31.083 --> 00:24:34.291
You have to make
the only decision you can make

00:24:34.292 --> 00:24:36.020
in good conscience,
Prime Minister.

00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:38.428
Good God, girls.
Listen to yourselves.

00:24:38.429 --> 00:24:40.925
It's not appeasement,
it's surrender.

00:24:40.926 --> 00:24:43.424
You still fail to realize
who we're up against.

00:24:43.425 --> 00:24:47.137
With respect, Prime Minister,
it's you who doesn't realize.

00:24:47.138 --> 00:24:48.539
We cannot hope to defeat him.

00:24:50.342 --> 00:24:53.368
Hitler is
the mainspring of evil,

00:24:54.177 --> 00:24:55.444
a guttersnipe.

00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:57.445
This is not a man
that we can negotiate with.

00:24:57.446 --> 00:24:59.383
I've read his book,
Admiral Pound.

00:24:59.485 --> 00:25:02.348
The man is a vicious,
victimized ideologue.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:03.477
He cannot be trusted.

00:25:06.316 --> 00:25:07.290
If I thought that
we could've achieved peace

00:25:07.291 --> 00:25:08.803
through surrendering,

00:25:08.804 --> 00:25:10.316
I'd have done it already.

00:25:10.317 --> 00:25:12.620
We need to stop our country
from starving.

00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:15.039
We need
three million tons of supplies

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.457
to cross the Atlantic
every month.

00:25:17.458 --> 00:25:19.828
We are currently losing
50% of that to U-boat attacks.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.569
Another reason to take the deal.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.806
I've not finished,
Algernon, darling.

00:25:26.375 --> 00:25:28.069
We need the Americans,

00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:29.841
and they will
never enter the war

00:25:29.842 --> 00:25:31.808
if we already appear
to be a losing side.

00:25:31.809 --> 00:25:34.113
Ending hostilities with Germany

00:25:34.114 --> 00:25:36.418
is the best path
out of this mess.

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.381
We are all in agreement,
Prime Minister.

00:25:40.554 --> 00:25:41.554
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:25:46.024 --> 00:25:47.197
Yes,
thank you, gentlemen!

00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:55.236
M, Fleming,
this better be good news.

00:25:55.237 --> 00:25:56.337
Prime Minister,

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:58.207
we have the manifest here, sir.

00:25:58.208 --> 00:25:59.773
It's been confirmed

00:25:59.774 --> 00:26:01.824
the Duchessa
is fully laden with supplies

00:26:01.825 --> 00:26:03.875
to keep the U-boats
operational indefinitely.

00:26:03.977 --> 00:26:07.611
If we're going to sink her,
now is the time.

00:26:07.713 --> 00:26:09.015
They're on their way.

00:26:10.352 --> 00:26:11.550
And their chances?

00:26:11.551 --> 00:26:14.548
Well, if anyone can, they can.

00:26:19.164 --> 00:26:20.825
But if we're discovered,

00:26:20.826 --> 00:26:22.798
parliament will remove you
from office.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.932
Well,

00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:28.798
we'd better make sure
we're not discovered then.

00:26:32.268 --> 00:26:33.375
We'll take it
from the cliffside.

00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:35.705
It's an 85-foot sheer climb.

00:26:35.706 --> 00:26:36.840
No one should notice

00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:39.012
a small, innocuous
fishing vessel.

00:26:39.013 --> 00:26:41.448
We'll set up in the woods
and see what we're up against,

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.551
then we'll go for a night raid.

00:26:43.552 --> 00:26:46.250
Slip in quietly,
find Apple, come out fast.

00:26:46.859 --> 00:26:48.118
Numbers?

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.584
Intelligence suggests
a garrison of 50 to 60.

00:26:52.022 --> 00:26:53.862
That should be about 15 each.

00:26:53.863 --> 00:26:57.431
Lassen, try not to be greedy.
You do have a reputation.

00:26:57.432 --> 00:26:59.898
My killing days are over.

00:26:59.899 --> 00:27:02.136
I'm just here
as a peacekeeping observer.

00:27:04.235 --> 00:27:06.901
Freddy, bag the kit,
silence the weapons.

00:27:51.487 --> 00:27:52.912
When do we go?

00:27:52.913 --> 00:27:54.757
0200.

00:27:54.758 --> 00:27:57.484
Take the towers first,
then move onto the radio room,

00:27:57.485 --> 00:27:59.653
barracks and end up
in the control room...

00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:03.847
What do we have here?

00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:05.463
Gestapo.

00:28:05.464 --> 00:28:07.199
How'd you know?

00:28:07.301 --> 00:28:10.199
The badder they are,
the better they're dressed.

00:28:10.301 --> 00:28:12.374
I really must get me
one of those coats.

00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:13.975
They must be here for Apple.

00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:18.176
It's either torture
or, uh, extraction, sir.

00:28:18.177 --> 00:28:20.482
If they extract him,
it'll be the end of Apple.

00:28:20.483 --> 00:28:21.675
We won't be seeing him again.

00:28:22.716 --> 00:28:23.982
I'm afraid, gentlemen,

00:28:23.983 --> 00:28:25.653
we're not going
to have the luxury of night.

00:28:25.654 --> 00:28:26.982
We're going
to have to go in now.

00:28:40.034 --> 00:28:41.281
So,
what's happened there then?

00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:42.528
It looks like

00:28:42.529 --> 00:28:43.681
they've been plugged
full of arrows, Haysey.

00:28:43.705 --> 00:28:44.905
Well, where did the arrows go?

00:28:45.971 --> 00:28:47.171
Straight through them.

00:28:50.614 --> 00:28:53.216
There were
two more round the other side.

00:28:53.318 --> 00:28:54.415
Where are they now?

00:28:54.517 --> 00:28:56.350
Same place as these two.

00:28:56.351 --> 00:28:57.817
Nazi heaven.

00:28:57.818 --> 00:28:59.453
Well, we've got
less than seven minutes

00:28:59.555 --> 00:29:00.785
before they're missed.

00:29:00.887 --> 00:29:03.016
Alarms, dogs. None of it good.

00:29:04.152 --> 00:29:05.726
Go undercover of the engine.

00:29:05.727 --> 00:29:07.556
Only break cover
when things go bang.

00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:12.568
I have a great idea, Lassen.

00:29:12.569 --> 00:29:14.229
Why don't you march off
by yourself

00:29:14.331 --> 00:29:15.811
and fill those Germans
full of arrows?

00:29:26.447 --> 00:29:28.579
Freddy, grab the scissors
and help him with that fence.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.649
Aye, sir.

00:29:49.971 --> 00:29:51.573
Haysey, you're with me.
We go left.

00:29:51.574 --> 00:29:54.402
Freddy, Lassen, you go right.

00:29:54.403 --> 00:29:56.123
Fill your boots, gentlemen,
and bon appetit.

00:30:00.146 --> 00:30:01.750
See you at the tower.

00:30:01.751 --> 00:30:03.551
And remember, gentlemen,
try to have fun.

00:30:42.618 --> 00:30:44.992
So far, so good.

00:30:45.094 --> 00:30:46.770
Doing rather well, Haysey.

00:30:46.794 --> 00:30:47.892
Oh, why thank you, sir.

00:31:05.682 --> 00:31:06.980
It's very good.

00:31:44.854 --> 00:31:47.015
Sounds like
stealth mode's over.

00:31:47.016 --> 00:31:48.090
Haysey, down!

00:32:54.923 --> 00:32:56.257
Nein! Nein!

00:33:29.091 --> 00:33:30.451
Do we know each other?

00:33:30.794 --> 00:33:32.557
No.

00:33:49.207 --> 00:33:51.008
Is that a heart, Lassen?

00:33:51.009 --> 00:33:52.811
For the avoidance of doubt.

00:33:52.812 --> 00:33:55.114
Apple, old boy.

00:33:55.115 --> 00:33:56.647
- Gus.
- I see you two have met.

00:33:57.687 --> 00:33:59.351
This is Haysey.

00:33:59.453 --> 00:34:01.921
- Pleasure, Haysey.
- Pleasure's mine.

00:34:02.023 --> 00:34:03.263
I thought you might need these.

00:34:04.222 --> 00:34:06.090
Jolly thoughtful of you.

00:34:06.192 --> 00:34:07.192
You all find him?

00:34:08.697 --> 00:34:09.858
Oh, goody.

00:34:12.036 --> 00:34:13.716
Bloody hell,
what happened to your nipples?

00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.867
You all right?

00:34:19.868 --> 00:34:22.277
Couldn't unplug me, could you?
Battery's still on.

00:35:40.287 --> 00:35:41.950
Did you see the Duchessa,

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:44.750
the tug boats?

00:35:44.751 --> 00:35:47.021
And rather
a lot of Nazi soldiers.

00:35:48.228 --> 00:35:49.965
Why wasn't that in your report?

00:35:49.966 --> 00:35:54.033
Because those soldiers
and those guns,

00:35:54.135 --> 00:35:56.701
and those S-Boats are all new.

00:35:58.605 --> 00:36:01.637
That's a lot more
than the boys are expecting.

00:36:01.739 --> 00:36:03.811
A month ago,
it was a dozen mechanics.

00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:05.043
Six drunk sailors.

00:36:05.044 --> 00:36:06.275
Two fat Spaniards.

00:36:06.276 --> 00:36:07.976
And a Nazi in a pear tree.

00:36:10.516 --> 00:36:12.453
I'd say,
we're gonna need more help.

00:36:14.616 --> 00:36:16.055
You leave that to me.

00:36:16.056 --> 00:36:17.419
Of course.

00:36:20.196 --> 00:36:21.856
But right now...

00:36:21.958 --> 00:36:24.027
...you need to meet that man.

00:36:27.234 --> 00:36:29.471
Your man.
The reason you're here.

00:36:29.472 --> 00:36:31.302
Ah.

00:36:31.303 --> 00:36:33.375
The only thing
worse than a Nazi...

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.740
is him.

00:37:03.537 --> 00:37:05.437
I'm very disappointed, Heron.

00:37:05.438 --> 00:37:07.735
There are 16 crates
in my warehouse

00:37:07.837 --> 00:37:10.341
you have not yet
shipped to the mainland.

00:37:10.342 --> 00:37:12.478
No need to fret, Herr Luhr.

00:37:12.479 --> 00:37:13.681
They'll still be delivered
by the agreed date.

00:37:13.682 --> 00:37:15.114
That may be.

00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:17.445
But they take up valuable space.

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:18.514
For this, I expect

00:37:18.515 --> 00:37:20.686
a significant reduction
in your fee.

00:37:22.324 --> 00:37:23.893
I can do 5%...

00:37:23.894 --> 00:37:25.524
...as a gesture of goodwill.

00:37:25.525 --> 00:37:29.064
Twenty. And don't waste
my precious time haggling.

00:37:29.065 --> 00:37:30.207
Well,
strictly speaking,

00:37:30.231 --> 00:37:31.596
there should be no reductions,

00:37:31.699 --> 00:37:34.964
since there's not yet been
any breach of contract.

00:37:34.965 --> 00:37:38.231
Five is more than polite,
20 rings like a sour note,

00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:40.035
it jars.

00:37:40.611 --> 00:37:42.538
It jars?

00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:44.993
Am I being
accused of disharmony?

00:37:44.994 --> 00:37:47.449
I take that
as a personal affront.

00:37:50.684 --> 00:37:53.920
And I am supposing
you are not the secretary.

00:37:53.921 --> 00:37:57.157
Miss Stewart is the contact
I said I'd arrange.

00:37:57.158 --> 00:37:59.626
Ah, your New York gold contact?

00:38:00.896 --> 00:38:01.955
I told you,

00:38:02.057 --> 00:38:04.257
I already have
a satisfying arrangement.

00:38:05.032 --> 00:38:06.181
Have a seat.

00:38:06.182 --> 00:38:07.331
Thank you.

00:38:12.475 --> 00:38:14.267
Well,
I hope I don't disappoint.

00:38:17.546 --> 00:38:19.514
I can't make a decision
on this presentation.

00:38:20.245 --> 00:38:21.545
Early days.

00:38:21.546 --> 00:38:23.532
Well, if early days
do come too soon,

00:38:23.533 --> 00:38:25.520
and seasons change
with a Hunter's Moon.

00:38:33.565 --> 00:38:34.565
Hmm.

00:38:35.094 --> 00:38:37.033
Hmm.

00:38:37.135 --> 00:38:37.933
I have to say, Heron,

00:38:37.934 --> 00:38:39.632
for all your flaws,

00:38:39.734 --> 00:38:41.701
you do have a habit
of pulling rabbits from hats.

00:38:46.406 --> 00:38:48.517
So, how much gold
do you wish to move,

00:38:48.518 --> 00:38:50.629
Miss Stewart?

00:38:52.807 --> 00:38:54.879
As much as you can find.

00:39:00.023 --> 00:39:02.390
As I mentioned before,

00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:05.389
I do already have
a very profitable arrangement.

00:39:05.491 --> 00:39:07.954
And despite of your commentary,

00:39:07.955 --> 00:39:10.400
I pride myself
on maintaining harmony.

00:39:11.695 --> 00:39:14.371
Now, why should I entertain you?

00:39:17.475 --> 00:39:19.599
Because you'll make more money
and have lots of fun

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.602
whilst doing so.

00:39:22.478 --> 00:39:25.811
If I'm not good for my word,
don't pay me.

00:39:41.996 --> 00:39:42.996
Bravo.

00:39:44.667 --> 00:39:47.261
I will talk to my people
and then we'll rendezvous.

00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:49.065
Lovely.

00:39:53.475 --> 00:39:55.376
When the sly red cat
barks at dawn,

00:39:55.377 --> 00:39:57.279
and kills just for her pleasure,

00:39:57.381 --> 00:40:00.214
who shares the meal
the cat did steal

00:40:00.215 --> 00:40:01.583
when both looked on in pleasure?

00:40:04.482 --> 00:40:05.482
Auf wiedersehen.

00:40:52.895 --> 00:40:54.296
The riddle was a nice touch.

00:40:58.107 --> 00:40:59.272
The hook's in.

00:41:02.379 --> 00:41:04.140
Now be careful
how you reel him in.

00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:16.718
I'll make sure
the harbor's empty

00:41:16.719 --> 00:41:17.923
when the boys arrive.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.360
How are you going to do that?

00:41:21.462 --> 00:41:23.728
I'll throw a party at my club.

00:41:23.729 --> 00:41:25.995
A costume party for the officers

00:41:26.098 --> 00:41:27.978
and a second party at the dock
for the soldiers.

00:41:29.766 --> 00:41:30.771
People like my parties.

00:41:31.976 --> 00:41:33.136
Everyone but Luhr.

00:41:33.935 --> 00:41:35.706
That will be your job.

00:41:35.707 --> 00:41:37.514
All the rats
will follow the piper.

00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:46.487
So,
if I understand correctly,

00:41:46.489 --> 00:41:47.983
we're currently
here in La Palma.

00:41:48.085 --> 00:41:49.925
We'll sail around
German-controlled Africa

00:41:49.926 --> 00:41:50.985
to Fernando Po,

00:41:51.087 --> 00:41:52.789
which is just
north of the Equator,

00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:54.709
just off the West African coast.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.628
So that's the shortest route?

00:41:56.629 --> 00:41:58.199
Yes, but we don't
want to go shorter.

00:41:58.301 --> 00:42:00.200
Our priority is not to be seen.

00:42:00.302 --> 00:42:02.768
You mean, be seen again.

00:42:02.769 --> 00:42:05.965
Again? Getting a little sloppy
on us now, Gussy?

00:42:05.966 --> 00:42:07.340
Had a run-in already?

00:42:07.341 --> 00:42:09.073
Never mind us, Apple, old boy.

00:42:10.014 --> 00:42:11.470
Remind me again

00:42:11.471 --> 00:42:12.948
how you found your nipples
attached to a car battery.

00:42:14.316 --> 00:42:15.946
Yes. Wasn't my fault.

00:42:15.947 --> 00:42:17.649
Bad intelligence.
Plus it was almost worth it

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.050
to watch
the heart-snatcher at work.

00:42:19.149 --> 00:42:21.054
I'm better known as a lover
than a fighter.

00:42:21.157 --> 00:42:22.414
Jesus Christ!

00:42:22.517 --> 00:42:23.986
If that's how you fight,
I'd hate to see you love.

00:42:23.987 --> 00:42:25.353
You don't have
to worry about that,

00:42:26.626 --> 00:42:28.574
you're too pretty for me.

00:42:28.575 --> 00:42:30.523
Freddy, on the other hand...

00:42:31.994 --> 00:42:33.526
You'd have to catch me first.

00:42:34.335 --> 00:42:35.572
I do love to hunt.

00:42:37.008 --> 00:42:38.036
You'd be lucky.

00:42:39.034 --> 00:42:40.499
I'm really getting quite hot.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.343
Anyway, my suggestion is
that we take this wider route.

00:42:43.344 --> 00:42:44.811
It's obviously longer

00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:46.711
but it should avoid
any awkward conversations

00:42:46.712 --> 00:42:48.611
with German U-boats
or British warships.

00:42:48.612 --> 00:42:49.780
Weather-dependent,

00:42:49.781 --> 00:42:51.544
we should make it there
in 15 days.

00:42:52.582 --> 00:42:53.818
Agreed.

00:42:53.819 --> 00:42:55.548
Haysey, do you think
you could manage that?

00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:57.620
Leave it to me, sir.

00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:23.210
Just do as you're told

00:43:23.211 --> 00:43:24.713
and get me another drink!

00:43:24.714 --> 00:43:25.913
Captain, sir.

00:43:26.015 --> 00:43:27.320
Can I get you something to eat?

00:43:27.422 --> 00:43:28.688
May I... Come this way.

00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:29.817
Take your hands off me.

00:43:32.557 --> 00:43:33.586
You know,

00:43:35.231 --> 00:43:36.231
I like you, Femi.

00:43:38.065 --> 00:43:41.002
But you touch me again
and you're going to jail.

00:43:41.003 --> 00:43:42.067
Femi.

00:43:47.376 --> 00:43:48.436
I'll deal with him.

00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:50.891
Please take care
of Miss Stewart.

00:43:53.616 --> 00:43:55.480
You know what you need,
Captain Binea?

00:43:55.582 --> 00:43:56.609
I know what I need.

00:43:57.386 --> 00:44:00.283
But do you, Ricardo?

00:44:01.786 --> 00:44:03.319
You need another drink.

00:44:06.095 --> 00:44:07.127
Marty,

00:44:07.229 --> 00:44:08.692
good stuff.

00:44:08.794 --> 00:44:11.143
Ricardo, that's why I love you.

00:44:11.144 --> 00:44:13.494
You understand.

00:44:14.503 --> 00:44:15.628
This is Fernando Po.

00:44:16.933 --> 00:44:17.938
Everybody's welcome.

00:44:19.276 --> 00:44:21.271
Si... Everybody.

00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:24.144
Too many body I think.

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.150
Armando?

00:44:30.753 --> 00:44:32.651
Have you fallen out
with our new friends?

00:44:32.652 --> 00:44:34.482
It's not fair, Ricardo.

00:44:35.291 --> 00:44:36.649
This is my harbor.

00:44:37.656 --> 00:44:39.327
I am in charge.

00:44:39.328 --> 00:44:40.708
Are they stepping on your toes?

00:44:40.709 --> 00:44:42.403
They don't step, they stamp!

00:44:42.404 --> 00:44:44.099
They tell Captain Binea nothing.

00:44:47.831 --> 00:44:49.065
Only now do I hear

00:44:49.066 --> 00:44:50.645
the Duchessa
is leaving the harbor early.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.310
Well, good riddance.

00:44:55.676 --> 00:44:57.076
The harbor will be yours again.

00:44:59.342 --> 00:45:01.674
When will you be free
of that ugly vessel?

00:45:02.352 --> 00:45:03.676
Three days earlier.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.679
Then we should
have another drink.

00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:09.986
To celebrate. Marty...

00:45:09.987 --> 00:45:11.926
Another round
for our Harbor Master.

00:45:13.622 --> 00:45:17.160
So, Captain, do you know
where they wish to relocate?

00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:20.528
It's neither cat nor dog
that kills for fun,

00:45:21.537 --> 00:45:23.696
it's the vixen, not another.

00:45:24.806 --> 00:45:27.241
There's only two
that kill for fun,

00:45:27.343 --> 00:45:29.542
my pretty friend,

00:45:29.543 --> 00:45:32.612
the fox and his human brother.

00:45:49.425 --> 00:45:51.724
I believe I have
resolved your little riddle.

00:45:53.469 --> 00:45:56.203
Chapeau. You play well.

00:45:59.408 --> 00:46:00.909
Speaking of foxes,

00:46:02.537 --> 00:46:05.738
Horowitz and Meyer,
West 47th Street.

00:46:06.614 --> 00:46:07.614
Have you heard of them?

00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:09.918
I don't believe I have, no.

00:46:43.982 --> 00:46:45.518
They're the largest gold traders

00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.422
in Midtown New York

00:46:47.423 --> 00:46:48.781
and you haven't heard of them?

00:46:49.988 --> 00:46:51.652
I'm afraid I haven't, no.

00:46:54.228 --> 00:46:56.324
I am familiar, of course,
with Horowitz and Haim.

00:46:56.426 --> 00:46:58.659
But they're in the west side
of the city.

00:47:01.404 --> 00:47:02.627
But then again,

00:47:02.628 --> 00:47:04.368
I'm sure you already
knew that, didn't you?

00:47:10.808 --> 00:47:11.808
I'm curious,

00:47:13.244 --> 00:47:15.379
how do you find
dealing with the Jew?

00:47:16.486 --> 00:47:18.684
Oh, dear.

00:47:18.786 --> 00:47:20.200
I've slipped from one snare

00:47:20.201 --> 00:47:21.616
only to find myself in another.

00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:24.625
How shall I put this?

00:47:25.463 --> 00:47:26.795
I fear your brilliant leader

00:47:26.796 --> 00:47:28.865
has mischaracterized
the ancient tribe of Jahuda.

00:47:29.698 --> 00:47:31.063
Their ability to not only

00:47:31.064 --> 00:47:33.732
survive 3,000 years
with a boot on their neck,

00:47:33.834 --> 00:47:37.136
but to prosper in spite of it...

00:47:37.137 --> 00:47:39.832
I suspect it inspired
satanic jealousy within him.

00:47:40.938 --> 00:47:42.076
In conclusion,

00:47:43.006 --> 00:47:44.479
it looks as though

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.048
the lady doth protest too much.

00:47:51.989 --> 00:47:54.752
Is there a cherry to go
on this blasphemous cake,

00:47:54.854 --> 00:47:56.125
or have you finished?

00:48:00.694 --> 00:48:03.194
I must confess,

00:48:03.296 --> 00:48:05.726
not only do I respect
and admire the Jew...

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:09.701
I am one.

00:48:31.318 --> 00:48:32.318
Kidding!

00:48:33.728 --> 00:48:34.887
They're greedy rats.

00:48:38.898 --> 00:48:40.031
I think this could be

00:48:40.032 --> 00:48:41.938
the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

00:48:43.907 --> 00:48:46.233
Then I shall throw a party
to celebrate.

00:48:46.335 --> 00:48:48.204
I don't care for parties.

00:48:48.205 --> 00:48:51.745
Oh, spoilsport!
Everybody loves a party.

00:48:53.479 --> 00:48:55.210
The Duchessa's leaving

00:48:55.211 --> 00:48:56.963
three days earlier
than we thought.

00:48:56.964 --> 00:48:58.717
If we don't tell
the Maid Honor,

00:48:59.787 --> 00:49:00.913
they'll arrive too late.

00:49:11.593 --> 00:49:12.828
Incoming.

00:49:14.402 --> 00:49:15.404
Contact.

00:49:16.865 --> 00:49:18.931
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

00:49:20.239 --> 00:49:21.769
Tin of corned beef's
out of pantry

00:49:22.644 --> 00:49:23.644
three days early.

00:49:27.550 --> 00:49:29.015
I'll take that.

00:49:29.016 --> 00:49:30.776
It's confidential,
sir. For M only.

00:49:32.822 --> 00:49:33.786
When it comes
to make the extraction,

00:49:33.787 --> 00:49:34.851
it needs to be a very...

00:49:34.953 --> 00:49:35.953
Sir. Message, sir.

00:49:40.093 --> 00:49:43.197
More Jerries
on the island than expected.

00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:46.830
Corned beef's out of the pantry

00:49:46.932 --> 00:49:47.960
three days early.

00:49:48.966 --> 00:49:51.062
Move faster.

00:49:51.063 --> 00:49:53.438
Yes, but there's increased
U-boat sightings in the area.

00:49:54.003 --> 00:49:55.003
Sir.

00:50:02.183 --> 00:50:03.743
The mission's
still proceeding.

00:50:06.683 --> 00:50:08.722
So, there's more
soldiers on the island

00:50:08.824 --> 00:50:09.818
and the boat's leaving earlier?

00:50:09.819 --> 00:50:11.155
Yes.

00:50:11.257 --> 00:50:12.627
Well, how are
we meant to move faster?

00:50:12.628 --> 00:50:13.826
We can't move faster.

00:50:13.827 --> 00:50:15.622
We're going as fast as we can.

00:50:15.623 --> 00:50:17.660
This is a fishing boat,
it's not a speedboat.

00:50:18.426 --> 00:50:19.892
Prime Minister,

00:50:19.893 --> 00:50:21.768
the Duchessa's leaving
Fernando Po in 12 days.

00:50:21.769 --> 00:50:23.398
On our current schedule,

00:50:23.399 --> 00:50:24.997
they'll arrive
three days too late.

00:50:26.808 --> 00:50:28.535
Can it still be done?

00:50:28.536 --> 00:50:30.270
We're still
awaiting a response

00:50:30.271 --> 00:50:31.271
from Major Phillips.

00:50:33.214 --> 00:50:35.246
If we can't move faster,
we'll go shorter.

00:50:35.247 --> 00:50:36.863
We can get to Fernando Po
in 12 days.

00:50:36.864 --> 00:50:38.574
Hold on, you said
we couldn't go shorter.

00:50:38.575 --> 00:50:40.831
No, I said
we don't want to go shorter.

00:50:40.832 --> 00:50:43.088
He said we'll get
mowed down by a U-boat.

00:50:43.089 --> 00:50:46.456
Or worse,
picked up by the Brits.

00:50:46.457 --> 00:50:48.359
Their armada of destroyers
are crossing there.

00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:50.924
We will literally
be sailing over U-boats.

00:50:51.966 --> 00:50:54.103
Sorry, lads, we go shorter.

00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:20.294
Drei, zwei, eins...

00:51:42.515 --> 00:51:44.582
Gentlemen,
as I speak to you now,

00:51:45.447 --> 00:51:47.188
London once again

00:51:47.189 --> 00:51:49.917
shudders beneath a Nazi
onslaught from the skies.

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.257
And at such times,

00:51:52.258 --> 00:51:55.359
the hearts of men
are stirred to duty.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.840
But you are not such men.

00:51:57.195 --> 00:51:58.494
You were not chosen

00:51:58.495 --> 00:52:01.669
for your conspicuous honor
or high ideals.

00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:02.728
You were chosen

00:52:02.729 --> 00:52:04.664
because you are
the last resort.

00:52:04.665 --> 00:52:05.864
The mission
you have been given

00:52:05.865 --> 00:52:09.440
is of a sort
never before undertaken.

00:52:09.441 --> 00:52:13.629
It demands ruthless men,
who will not hesitate

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:17.818
to stoop beneath
the conventions of war.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.914
Men who do not keep clean hands.

00:52:21.625 --> 00:52:23.554
Men like you.

00:52:23.555 --> 00:52:25.356
And yet, who still conspire

00:52:25.357 --> 00:52:27.955
in their own
discordant harmony.

00:52:27.956 --> 00:52:32.759
Who know and yet do not care
that they may never return.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.034
And who press onward
not for glory,

00:52:36.035 --> 00:52:38.402
or for duty, or for me,

00:52:38.403 --> 00:52:41.071
but because you are men
who will not stop

00:52:41.072 --> 00:52:42.134
until it is done.

00:52:43.307 --> 00:52:44.609
Godspeed, gentlemen.

00:52:54.856 --> 00:52:56.654
Uh... Chaps...

00:52:58.653 --> 00:53:00.152
That's a British destroyer.

00:53:03.832 --> 00:53:05.668
We should move.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:07.159
We can't outrun that, sir.

00:53:09.666 --> 00:53:13.165
Well, we've seen them,
they've seen us.

00:53:19.412 --> 00:53:21.080
Hold fast, Maid Honor.

00:53:21.183 --> 00:53:22.882
We're preparing
a boarding party.

00:53:22.984 --> 00:53:24.176
Hello, Captain!

00:53:25.613 --> 00:53:27.514
Nothing exciting here.

00:53:27.616 --> 00:53:29.517
We're just Swedish fishermen.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.183
Step forward, Jorgensen!

00:53:32.995 --> 00:53:34.326
Jorgensen, you're Swedish.

00:53:34.327 --> 00:53:35.967
Ask them where
they're heading, would you?

00:53:41.201 --> 00:53:42.197
Not you, Lassen.

00:53:42.198 --> 00:53:43.198
Uh...

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:47.243
I want to hear March-Phillips
have a go.

00:53:48.039 --> 00:53:49.069
Ah.

00:53:50.977 --> 00:53:52.880
Fair enough.

00:53:52.881 --> 00:53:55.113
Game's up, Commander.

00:53:55.215 --> 00:53:56.685
Can't blame a girl for trying.

00:53:56.686 --> 00:53:58.110
Good effort, Major.

00:53:58.212 --> 00:54:00.284
But I'm afraid you are going
to have to come with us.

00:54:00.285 --> 00:54:02.086
May I ask under whose authority

00:54:02.188 --> 00:54:03.748
we've been waylaid?

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:05.217
On the orders of Admiral Pound.

00:54:10.197 --> 00:54:11.226
First Lieutenant.

00:54:11.227 --> 00:54:12.297
You are pursuing

00:54:12.399 --> 00:54:15.067
an unsanctioned
criminal enterprise

00:54:15.068 --> 00:54:17.531
in international waters.

00:54:17.532 --> 00:54:19.570
You're going to cause an upset.

00:54:19.672 --> 00:54:23.142
I think we're a little
past upset, Commander.

00:54:23.143 --> 00:54:24.475
Stevens, what have you got?

00:54:24.476 --> 00:54:25.809
I had a ping, sir.

00:54:26.883 --> 00:54:28.150
The greedy little Nazi

00:54:28.252 --> 00:54:30.784
won't be satisfied
with holding most of Europe,

00:54:30.785 --> 00:54:33.317
he's after our own
green and pleasant land.

00:54:33.318 --> 00:54:34.714
Well, thank God you're here

00:54:34.715 --> 00:54:36.000
with your little
wooden battleship

00:54:36.024 --> 00:54:38.255
and your five-man army.

00:54:38.256 --> 00:54:40.327
U-boat, bearing 273.

00:54:40.328 --> 00:54:42.400
Sound the alarm.

00:54:42.424 --> 00:54:43.891
Come aboard.

00:54:43.892 --> 00:54:45.812
U-boat approaching.
Starboard side, sir.

00:54:45.901 --> 00:54:47.795
Battle stations!

00:54:47.897 --> 00:54:50.398
Major, if you know
what's good for you,

00:54:50.399 --> 00:54:52.153
- you'll head home.
- Very good, Commander.

00:54:52.154 --> 00:54:53.908
Haysey, get us away
from that torpedo magnet

00:54:53.909 --> 00:54:55.239
as quickly as possible.

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.703
Aye, sir. Apple, man the stern.

00:54:57.704 --> 00:54:59.246
Freddy, on the main sail.

00:54:59.247 --> 00:55:01.540
Lassen to the bow, now.
Untie that station!

00:55:01.541 --> 00:55:02.916
Aye.

00:55:02.917 --> 00:55:05.384
Quickly now, lads!

00:55:05.385 --> 00:55:07.488
Hoist that foresail for us,
will you, boys?

00:55:09.157 --> 00:55:10.590
Main sail ready to haul!

00:55:15.762 --> 00:55:17.423
All right, Freddy,
now raise that main sail!

00:55:17.424 --> 00:55:18.760
Aye.

00:55:18.761 --> 00:55:20.244
Report sounding.

00:55:20.268 --> 00:55:21.667
Bearing 163.

00:55:30.611 --> 00:55:31.715
Lassen, trim the main sail

00:55:31.739 --> 00:55:33.211
and then tie it off!

00:55:33.313 --> 00:55:34.614
How do you expect good?

00:55:36.481 --> 00:55:37.576
Report sounding.

00:55:37.577 --> 00:55:39.285
Bearing 115.

00:55:39.286 --> 00:55:40.381
Fire depth charges.

00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:17.489
So, this is your man
that gets things done?

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:20.352
His name is Kamp Billy...
with a K.

00:56:23.465 --> 00:56:25.105
And he went
to an English boarding school?

00:56:26.502 --> 00:56:29.537
Not just any boarding school.
He went to Eton,

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.364
the boarding school.

00:56:33.842 --> 00:56:34.872
Right...

00:56:38.807 --> 00:56:39.847
Then what's he doing here?

00:56:40.246 --> 00:56:41.839
He's a prince.

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.285
A prince of what, exactly?

00:56:44.387 --> 00:56:47.384
The Prince of Fernando Po!

00:56:47.385 --> 00:56:50.382
So, he's part pirate,
part aristocrat?

00:56:51.552 --> 00:56:53.457
Chic.

00:56:53.458 --> 00:56:55.387
He's also
a part of our solution.

00:56:57.767 --> 00:56:59.030
RH.

00:56:59.866 --> 00:57:00.964
KB.

00:57:01.663 --> 00:57:02.902
He's back in town.

00:57:03.004 --> 00:57:04.004
Chief.

00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:14.406
Seems like
you always come bearing gifts.

00:57:16.084 --> 00:57:17.911
Is she for me?

00:57:18.013 --> 00:57:19.411
Good luck with that.

00:57:20.517 --> 00:57:21.517
I'm not for you,

00:57:22.519 --> 00:57:24.089
but these are.

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:26.425
Mmm. Goodies. Yummy.

00:57:29.429 --> 00:57:30.589
- Ade...
- Chief.

00:57:31.794 --> 00:57:32.866
Come on, come on.

00:57:36.434 --> 00:57:37.836
Someone has taste.

00:57:39.075 --> 00:57:42.192
Rarer than hens' teeth.

00:57:42.193 --> 00:57:45.310
Well, RH tells me that KB

00:57:45.412 --> 00:57:46.907
is the only man to talk to

00:57:46.908 --> 00:57:49.096
when it comes
to getting things done.

00:57:49.097 --> 00:57:51.358
Why do I feel like
I've gone from being

00:57:51.359 --> 00:57:53.621
the predator to the prey?

00:58:00.887 --> 00:58:02.958
Quite an entrance, young lady.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:04.780
It's on the condition
that we sample them...

00:58:05.802 --> 00:58:06.832
now.

00:58:10.271 --> 00:58:11.535
Ade, set the table.

00:58:11.536 --> 00:58:12.800
Chief.

00:58:12.903 --> 00:58:15.208
And then the Duke said,

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:16.911
"Push it in till it stops!"

00:58:22.581 --> 00:58:25.180
You are quite the weapon.

00:58:25.955 --> 00:58:26.955
I was right,

00:58:27.925 --> 00:58:29.052
I was the prey.

00:58:32.319 --> 00:58:35.761
I'll help you
because I don't like Nazis.

00:58:35.762 --> 00:58:38.796
Not because they're Nazis
but because they're gauche.

00:58:38.797 --> 00:58:40.793
I'll give you a tug
and 12 of my best men,

00:58:40.794 --> 00:58:42.329
including yours truly.

00:58:43.936 --> 00:58:46.834
But if I'm gonna help you,
who's gonna help me?

00:58:46.937 --> 00:58:48.742
Because you're
not a soldier, RH.

00:58:50.013 --> 00:58:52.306
No, but she is.

00:58:55.548 --> 00:58:57.014
She'll outshoot your best man.

00:59:34.188 --> 00:59:35.188
I told you.

00:59:38.753 --> 00:59:40.293
- No!
- No!

00:59:42.562 --> 00:59:43.962
Stork delivery. Check.

00:59:45.033 --> 00:59:46.299
Check.

00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:47.966
Twenty-three boys. Check.

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.639
Stork delivery.

00:59:53.241 --> 00:59:56.240
Twenty-three boys.

00:59:56.343 --> 00:59:59.679
Seventeen girls.

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.882
Meeting point 20 kilometers
outside Fernando Po.

01:00:04.452 --> 01:00:05.492
The rendezvous with Heron.

01:00:06.684 --> 01:00:07.868
Can you get us there?

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:09.053
If the weather holds,

01:00:10.257 --> 01:00:11.291
I can, sir.

01:00:28.808 --> 01:00:30.328
Twenty quid says
this doesn't end well.

01:00:31.145 --> 01:00:32.175
For who?

01:00:32.774 --> 01:00:34.275
For them.

01:00:34.276 --> 01:00:36.608
You can't bet on yourself,
Haysey. That's match-fixing.

01:00:38.615 --> 01:00:39.615
Let's do it.

01:00:40.884 --> 01:00:42.256
Heron, it's been too long.

01:00:42.257 --> 01:00:44.090
Good to see you, Gus.

01:00:44.091 --> 01:00:45.188
Apple.

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:49.665
This is Kamp Billy,
the Prince of Fernando Po.

01:00:50.628 --> 01:00:51.933
Your Highness.

01:00:52.235 --> 01:00:53.427
He's agreed to help us.

01:00:54.731 --> 01:00:57.099
Forgive me, but...

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:00.921
I have a peculiar feeling
that we've met before.

01:01:00.922 --> 01:01:04.032
I get that a lot.
I'm extremely well-traveled.

01:01:04.033 --> 01:01:07.144
No, no.
It's a particular sense.

01:01:09.949 --> 01:01:13.317
I don't suppose
you played cricket, did you?

01:01:15.523 --> 01:01:18.192
Captained Eton. '21 to '22.

01:01:18.294 --> 01:01:20.526
I knew I knew your face!

01:01:20.629 --> 01:01:22.528
Right next
to the trophy cabinet.

01:01:22.631 --> 01:01:25.298
An eight-foot-tall
huge portrait.

01:01:25.299 --> 01:01:28.203
Yes, exactly that!

01:01:28.305 --> 01:01:29.567
One eye on the boundary...

01:01:29.669 --> 01:01:31.162
...one eye on the pub.

01:01:31.264 --> 01:01:32.738
Bloody glad to have you aboard.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.560
Bloody good
to be here, old boy.

01:01:35.035 --> 01:01:36.809
I'm very bored

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:38.809
with these Nazis making
a nuisance of themselves.

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:40.346
I mean,
it's terrible for business.

01:01:40.448 --> 01:01:42.176
I'm only too pleased

01:01:42.278 --> 01:01:45.353
to help you
serve them a bloody nose.

01:01:45.354 --> 01:01:47.145
That's a commendable attitude.

01:01:47.146 --> 01:01:48.923
So, what's your plan?

01:01:49.025 --> 01:01:50.055
Apple.

01:01:51.561 --> 01:01:52.523
We're going
to sink the Duchessa,

01:01:52.525 --> 01:01:54.189
plus the two tugs.

01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:56.360
Crippling Hitler's
Atlantic fleet of U-boats.

01:01:56.361 --> 01:01:57.895
Very good.

01:01:57.997 --> 01:02:00.368
The thing is,
our old friends the Nazis

01:02:00.369 --> 01:02:01.832
aren't making it the easiest.

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:04.067
We're outnumbered
two hundred to five.

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:06.050
There's a few more soldiers
than we anticipated.

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:08.169
I think that we're gonna have

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:10.207
to find ourselves
a few more strapping lads.

01:02:11.047 --> 01:02:12.278
Ade...

01:02:22.325 --> 01:02:23.715
Right...

01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:28.896
Yes, I think that will do.

01:02:30.534 --> 01:02:32.796
We brought some weapons
if you need.

01:02:32.797 --> 01:02:35.059
You hold onto those.
We brought our own.

01:02:37.938 --> 01:02:40.275
Oyah!
Show them the iron!

01:02:43.236 --> 01:02:44.941
Marvelous.

01:02:44.942 --> 01:02:46.471
You do know
the Duchessa is

01:02:46.573 --> 01:02:49.028
more than 200 feet
from the harbor side?

01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:51.484
And she's in full glare
of the lights.

01:02:51.586 --> 01:02:53.411
She's not gonna be easy to sink

01:02:53.412 --> 01:02:55.480
without attracting
unwanted attention.

01:02:55.582 --> 01:02:58.824
Yes. That's why Heron
will plant a bomb

01:02:58.926 --> 01:03:01.220
to blow the lights,
before we paddle in

01:03:01.221 --> 01:03:04.092
and rig the hull
with explosives.

01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:06.465
By the time
the explosives detonate,

01:03:06.567 --> 01:03:07.768
we'll be heading home.

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:09.933
If I had it my way,
a shot'll never be fired.

01:03:10.035 --> 01:03:12.505
And how often
do you have it your way?

01:03:12.607 --> 01:03:14.506
Depends on who you ask, old boy.

01:03:16.741 --> 01:03:18.007
Gentlemen...

01:03:18.008 --> 01:03:19.274
- Ade.
- Chief.

01:03:19.376 --> 01:03:21.342
Prepare the men.

01:03:21.445 --> 01:03:23.412
I'll take that 20
whenever you're ready, Freddy.

01:03:42.268 --> 01:03:44.268
The Duchessa
will be gone by the morning.

01:03:45.004 --> 01:03:46.564
Can you manage that?

01:03:48.478 --> 01:03:50.802
It's two wires and a tick-tock.

01:03:52.107 --> 01:03:53.508
I'm sure I can cope.

01:03:55.279 --> 01:03:57.182
It's not me you should be
worried about.

01:03:59.788 --> 01:04:01.813
I've never
taken a Nazi to a party.

01:04:04.959 --> 01:04:07.621
Just don't end up
at one of his parties.

01:04:11.698 --> 01:04:12.824
Don't worry about me.

01:04:14.099 --> 01:04:15.904
I'm gonna have
my own little party.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.354
Drink for the boys,
on His Majesty's government.

01:04:28.047 --> 01:04:30.982
Ordinarily,
I'd bite your hand off,

01:04:30.983 --> 01:04:33.321
as I have been known
to love a pound note.

01:04:37.152 --> 01:04:38.472
But on this occasion,

01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:41.853
the drinks are on me.

01:04:43.232 --> 01:04:44.657
However,

01:04:44.658 --> 01:04:46.902
if His Majesty's government
was handing out titles...

01:04:48.033 --> 01:04:50.700
You're already a prince,
old boy.

01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:53.369
There's Prince
of Fernando Po, but...

01:04:53.471 --> 01:04:56.241
a Knight of the Realm
has a certain antiquity to it.

01:04:58.877 --> 01:05:01.114
Arise, Sir Kamp Billy.

01:05:03.585 --> 01:05:04.876
You're a good man, Gus.

01:05:05.916 --> 01:05:06.916
Good luck, Billy.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:18.725
Hola!

01:05:20.196 --> 01:05:21.970
Buenas tardes, companeros!

01:06:59.392 --> 01:07:00.992
My Herr, you have a visitor.

01:07:04.373 --> 01:07:05.832
Ta-da!

01:07:10.707 --> 01:07:13.004
Cleopatra needs her Caesar.

01:07:13.548 --> 01:07:14.577
Put it on.

01:07:18.277 --> 01:07:19.318
Thank you, Timothy.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.280
One second.

01:07:21.853 --> 01:07:22.882
Timothy...

01:07:24.693 --> 01:07:26.551
I have a counter offer.

01:07:26.654 --> 01:07:28.929
Let's put
this dressing up aside.

01:07:29.031 --> 01:07:31.660
It's for children.
And we are not children.

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.236
Let's make our own party.

01:07:37.474 --> 01:07:38.667
A dark party.

01:07:39.641 --> 01:07:42.943
A dark Nazi party.

01:07:42.944 --> 01:07:47.214
With music, lubrication
and a handsome Nazi.

01:07:48.651 --> 01:07:50.017
Since I've been here,

01:07:50.018 --> 01:07:53.218
I've been bitten by things
that croak and slither,

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.337
scorpions nest in my boots
and I can't sleep

01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:57.356
for the relentless howl
of jungle entropy.

01:07:58.053 --> 01:07:59.322
Tonight,

01:07:59.323 --> 01:08:03.362
I'm going to that party,
and you are taking me.

01:08:05.095 --> 01:08:07.135
Now, put it on.

01:08:08.572 --> 01:08:09.572
Oh.

01:08:10.704 --> 01:08:11.968
Very well.

01:08:52.109 --> 01:08:53.610
Ah! Hola!

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.261
We move when the lights go out.

01:09:27.783 --> 01:09:29.140
All right, Ricardo,

01:09:30.544 --> 01:09:33.683
today you're El Capitan.

01:09:33.684 --> 01:09:36.371
Armando, the bar is yours.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.059
Use it. Abuse it at your will.

01:09:39.161 --> 01:09:41.860
That's why I love you.

01:09:41.962 --> 01:09:43.664
Come with me, handsome.

01:09:47.532 --> 01:09:49.204
I need you
to keep the men happy.

01:09:51.706 --> 01:09:52.735
How happy?

01:10:11.386 --> 01:10:12.386
Mmm.

01:10:14.963 --> 01:10:17.461
Are the rats in the nest?

01:10:17.462 --> 01:10:21.064
You won't find a German,
Spanish or Italian officer

01:10:21.166 --> 01:10:22.497
anywhere else tonight.

01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.987
Between the beer fest
at the harbor

01:10:30.011 --> 01:10:31.674
and this little get-together,

01:10:31.675 --> 01:10:34.040
that'll be 90% of the soldiers
away from the dock.

01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:37.551
The charge is set
to blow the harbor lights

01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:38.654
in 30 minutes.

01:10:40.186 --> 01:10:42.552
Can you keep him here that long?

01:10:42.654 --> 01:10:45.216
Silly boy, silly question.
Look at the dress.

01:10:55.736 --> 01:10:56.771
Hi.

01:10:56.873 --> 01:10:59.030
So, you call this a party?

01:10:59.031 --> 01:11:00.702
This is just
the thin end of the wedge.

01:11:00.703 --> 01:11:03.405
I've created a performance
just for you.

01:11:03.406 --> 01:11:06.109
Well, I could show you
a real party.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:34.850
Why do I care, Spaghetti?

01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:37.076
Pizza.

01:11:37.077 --> 01:11:39.177
Excuse me
while I powder my nose.

01:11:39.178 --> 01:11:41.071
What, again?

01:11:41.072 --> 01:11:43.544
Don't panic, Caesar.
Brush up on your Italian.

01:11:43.545 --> 01:11:46.185
Your gift needs to be wrapped.

01:11:46.186 --> 01:11:48.133
Keep those officers
drinking, please.

01:11:48.134 --> 01:11:50.080
- Of course. Okay.
- Thank you, Femi.

01:11:50.081 --> 01:11:51.953
The Duchessa's hull
has been reinforced.

01:11:52.993 --> 01:11:53.993
It won't sink.

01:11:55.096 --> 01:11:56.358
We need to stop the mission.

01:12:03.104 --> 01:12:04.431
That's going to be hard to do.

01:12:04.432 --> 01:12:06.037
Listen to me.

01:12:06.139 --> 01:12:07.437
Our mission will fail.

01:12:07.438 --> 01:12:08.736
The explosives won't work

01:12:08.737 --> 01:12:11.302
because he's reinforced it
to be unsinkable.

01:12:13.015 --> 01:12:14.055
You have to stop them now.

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:19.984
But the charge is about
to blow the lights.

01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:23.131
Well, if you can't
stop the lights,

01:12:23.155 --> 01:12:24.188
stop the men.

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.020
Luhr must not leave this party.

01:12:27.128 --> 01:12:28.957
I'll keep him busy. Go, now.

01:13:08.531 --> 01:13:10.068
And we're off.

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:11.432
Gus, wait.

01:13:31.227 --> 01:13:33.560
Stork to Maid,
Stork to Maid, come in.

01:13:35.029 --> 01:13:36.285
Channel five.

01:13:36.286 --> 01:13:38.166
This is Maid. Switching to 20.

01:13:40.561 --> 01:13:42.136
Go ahead.

01:13:42.238 --> 01:13:44.263
Tin of corned beef
can't be cracked.

01:13:45.206 --> 01:13:46.606
The ship cannot be sunk.

01:13:47.570 --> 01:13:49.235
Explosives will fail.

01:13:50.275 --> 01:13:51.868
It's Stork, sir.

01:13:51.869 --> 01:13:52.876
Put him on open speaker.

01:13:54.207 --> 01:13:55.978
Corned beef
can't be cracked.

01:13:56.611 --> 01:13:57.911
Stork, this is M.

01:13:58.013 --> 01:13:59.977
Never mind the corned beef.
Just find a way.

01:14:00.079 --> 01:14:02.178
- Over.
- Pound incoming, sir.

01:14:02.179 --> 01:14:03.452
- Repeat...
- Switch that off.

01:14:03.453 --> 01:14:04.727
We must...

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:08.390
Stop this immediately.

01:14:08.391 --> 01:14:11.432
What you are doing ends now,

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:13.724
or every last one of you
will be subject to a tribunal.

01:14:13.725 --> 01:14:15.566
Is that clear?

01:14:15.567 --> 01:14:17.604
I don't know what
you're talking about, sir.

01:14:19.042 --> 01:14:21.432
Is that correct, Sergeant?

01:14:25.314 --> 01:14:26.541
Hold position.

01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:28.842
How long, Stork?

01:14:28.843 --> 01:14:29.917
- Awaiting orders.
- Give me that.

01:14:29.918 --> 01:14:30.920
Stand by.

01:14:31.954 --> 01:14:33.343
March-Phillips,

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:36.187
this is Admiral Pound
giving you a direct order.

01:14:36.289 --> 01:14:37.917
Abort this mission now.

01:14:37.918 --> 01:14:39.117
I will make sure that

01:14:39.118 --> 01:14:41.052
none of you see
the light of day again.

01:14:41.053 --> 01:14:42.526
You will spend
the rest of your lives

01:14:42.527 --> 01:14:44.428
locked up
at His Majesty's pleasure.

01:14:44.429 --> 01:14:45.779
That includes all of you.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:47.040
Geoffrey Appleyard,

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:48.301
Anders Lassen,

01:14:48.302 --> 01:14:49.302
- Freddy Buzz...
- I'm sorry...

01:14:49.303 --> 01:14:50.551
...and Henry Hayes.

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:51.804
Can't quite make out

01:14:51.903 --> 01:14:53.783
what you're saying.

01:14:54.469 --> 01:14:56.036
Bye.

01:14:56.138 --> 01:14:57.340
Is... Is that clear?

01:14:57.341 --> 01:14:59.037
Sorry? What?

01:14:59.038 --> 01:15:00.914
I can't...
I can't quite hear you.

01:15:01.939 --> 01:15:03.474
Please... fuck off.

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:11.152
You and your operation
are reckless, Brigadier.

01:15:12.427 --> 01:15:14.219
I will personally
advise parliament

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:17.394
to have the Prime Minister
removed from office.

01:15:17.496 --> 01:15:19.127
And I am going to shut you down.

01:15:20.534 --> 01:15:23.362
Message received
loud and clear, sir.

01:15:30.006 --> 01:15:32.806
I suggest you also
fuck off, Sergeant.

01:15:32.807 --> 01:15:34.505
Fleming, contact March-Phillips.

01:15:38.949 --> 01:15:40.436
Lily, get me
the Prime Minister on hotline.

01:15:40.437 --> 01:15:41.924
- Right away, sir.
- Come in, 01.

01:15:41.948 --> 01:15:43.254
Come in, do you receive?

01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:49.857
- Yes?
- Prime Minister,

01:15:49.858 --> 01:15:51.522
I'm afraid
we've been discovered.

01:15:54.432 --> 01:15:55.827
There was a mole in our midst

01:15:55.828 --> 01:15:57.062
and Admiral Pound

01:15:57.164 --> 01:15:58.968
has ordered the mission
to be aborted.

01:15:58.969 --> 01:16:01.532
He wants to have parliament
remove you from office.

01:16:02.673 --> 01:16:04.158
The mission must continue.

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:05.643
01, this is base. Over.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.007
Tell Pound
if he has a problem,

01:16:07.008 --> 01:16:09.150
to take it up with me.
He knows where I live.

01:16:09.151 --> 01:16:10.880
Tell the men to press on.

01:16:10.982 --> 01:16:13.214
I'm afraid we've lost
all communication, sir.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:18.342
There must be
something that we can do.

01:16:18.394 --> 01:16:21.261
The only thing
I can do is remind you,

01:16:21.364 --> 01:16:23.462
the reason
we chose March-Phillips

01:16:23.463 --> 01:16:25.798
is because
he doesn't follow orders.

01:16:28.831 --> 01:16:30.363
Then let's hope we chose well.

01:16:35.368 --> 01:16:38.068
The Duchessa's hull
has been reinforced.

01:16:38.170 --> 01:16:40.043
Which means she can't be sunk.

01:16:40.044 --> 01:16:43.375
At least not with the amount
of explosives we're carrying.

01:16:43.376 --> 01:16:45.717
Just wondering how and when
exactly this took place.

01:16:45.718 --> 01:16:47.585
It's not important
how and when, it's happened.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:49.721
Well, it is
kind of important, Gus.

01:16:49.722 --> 01:16:51.757
I don't care
about the prison time,

01:16:51.859 --> 01:16:53.654
but I do care about finishing
what we've started.

01:16:53.655 --> 01:16:55.021
Thank you, Freddy.

01:16:55.022 --> 01:16:56.208
There must be
some sort of mistake.

01:16:56.232 --> 01:16:57.661
You can't just reinforce...

01:16:57.662 --> 01:16:59.092
There's no mistake, Haysey.

01:16:59.194 --> 01:17:00.860
I'm just lost about
how and when exactly...

01:17:00.861 --> 01:17:02.098
Enough!

01:17:10.708 --> 01:17:12.108
Why don't we sink the tug boats?

01:17:13.647 --> 01:17:15.127
Get rid of the shuttle
to the U-boats.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.108
It's not enough.

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:19.450
They'll replace them in a week.

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:30.493
Why don't we steal them?

01:17:30.595 --> 01:17:31.894
We can use Billy's boat

01:17:31.895 --> 01:17:33.597
to drag the Duchessa
out of the harbor

01:17:33.598 --> 01:17:35.301
and steal the other two
German tug boats

01:17:35.302 --> 01:17:36.634
that service the U-boats.

01:17:36.736 --> 01:17:38.529
And how are
we supposed to do that?

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:42.137
Not only is she double-plated,
weighing twice as much,

01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:43.936
but you'd need a full crew
to move a ship that size.

01:17:43.937 --> 01:17:45.676
The tug boats are the crew.

01:17:45.677 --> 01:17:47.341
We tow the Duchessa
out to the ocean

01:17:48.515 --> 01:17:50.714
and, well, steal the lot.

01:17:50.715 --> 01:17:53.314
Then what?
We still can't sink them.

01:17:54.453 --> 01:17:55.784
We don't need to.

01:17:55.785 --> 01:17:57.381
We sail
into international waters

01:17:57.483 --> 01:17:58.951
and hand everything
over to the Navy.

01:17:58.952 --> 01:18:00.318
They're following us anyway,

01:18:00.319 --> 01:18:01.492
so they'll be more than happy
to see us again.

01:18:01.493 --> 01:18:03.027
And what about the anchor?

01:18:04.366 --> 01:18:05.565
Have you seen the size of it?

01:18:05.667 --> 01:18:07.599
If we're gonna
actually start to move her,

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.533
their S-boats
will catch us in seconds.

01:18:09.635 --> 01:18:10.900
Well, what are you going to do

01:18:10.901 --> 01:18:12.621
with all the explosives
you brought, Freddy?

01:18:13.971 --> 01:18:15.905
We'll use them
to blow the anchor.

01:18:15.906 --> 01:18:18.238
We'll rig the S-boats
so they can't follow,

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:20.412
rig the fuel reserve
that supplies the U-boats,

01:18:20.514 --> 01:18:24.176
and then, well, blow the lot up.

01:18:24.278 --> 01:18:25.850
That fuel explosion's
gonna bring

01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:27.497
everyone and their mother
down to the harbor.

01:18:27.521 --> 01:18:29.152
We set the fuse,

01:18:29.153 --> 01:18:31.588
so that the fuel dump blows
once we're outside the harbor.

01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:34.091
Then we sneak out quietly.

01:18:35.723 --> 01:18:36.723
Not bad.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.998
It's very greedy.

01:18:41.866 --> 01:18:44.431
- Well, I'm in.
- Well,

01:18:44.533 --> 01:18:47.772
I'm not leaving until I have
a barrel full of Nazi hearts.

01:18:47.773 --> 01:18:49.876
I'll do whatever
you tell me to do, sir.

01:18:52.576 --> 01:18:53.605
Gentlemen,

01:18:58.716 --> 01:19:00.216
let's steal some boats.

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:12.723
Turns out she's double-plated,
so change of plans.

01:19:14.593 --> 01:19:16.233
We're going
to steal the boats instead.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:20.731
Is that even possible?

01:19:22.575 --> 01:19:23.734
I'm not entirely sure.

01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:28.140
But if you're up for it,
so are we.

01:19:29.374 --> 01:19:30.534
And you know what that means.

01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:34.454
A lot more blood
and a lot more sweat.

01:19:34.557 --> 01:19:36.153
Hopefully not any of ours,
old boy.

01:19:38.388 --> 01:19:40.322
I don't think we can do this
without you, Billy.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.169
Well, I'm up for it if you are.

01:19:54.401 --> 01:19:55.737
I think we're gonna
need your tug.

01:19:58.914 --> 01:20:00.845
Haysey and I will
take a stroll along the harbor

01:20:00.947 --> 01:20:03.749
and take out
any soldiers still patrolling.

01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:05.484
Freddy will bring
his dinghy around

01:20:05.586 --> 01:20:06.807
and take care of the S-boats.

01:20:06.808 --> 01:20:08.088
We'll meet you by the tug boats.

01:20:09.448 --> 01:20:10.752
And the Duchessa?

01:20:10.753 --> 01:20:12.319
That's Apple and me.

01:20:12.422 --> 01:20:14.891
We'll take care of any crew
and blow the anchor.

01:20:14.892 --> 01:20:16.212
And destroy their comms.

01:20:17.996 --> 01:20:20.264
Not sure
what you'll meet on board.

01:20:20.265 --> 01:20:22.533
Take my top boy
and two more of my men.

01:20:24.638 --> 01:20:26.467
Gentlemen, let's prepare.

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:37.812

Yes.

01:23:53.878 --> 01:23:54.911
He made a crash!

01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:12.330

01:25:29.074 --> 01:25:30.841
- Commander.
- All good, Freddy?

01:25:30.943 --> 01:25:32.240
Charges are set to go

01:25:32.241 --> 01:25:33.561
once we're out
of the harbor, sir.

01:25:34.914 --> 01:25:36.440
Let's carry on then.

01:25:51.758 --> 01:25:53.123
Did you enjoy your gift?

01:25:53.965 --> 01:25:54.993
Mmm.

01:25:57.299 --> 01:26:00.303
I think now it's time

01:26:00.405 --> 01:26:04.134
that the fox shows his den
to the vixen.

01:26:38.772 --> 01:26:41.006
Heron, why are
the lights still on?

01:26:42.378 --> 01:26:43.841
I lit the room with oil lamps,

01:26:43.842 --> 01:26:45.722
so they wouldn't notice
when the power went out.

01:27:28.125 --> 01:27:29.428
Look out!

01:27:47.343 --> 01:27:48.740
Freddy, rig this 88,

01:27:48.842 --> 01:27:50.242
then take the first tug
with Haysey.

01:27:54.055 --> 01:27:55.887
- Gute nacht.
- Guten abend.

01:28:00.993 --> 01:28:02.458
Guten abend.

01:28:28.454 --> 01:28:29.695
Terribly sorry, old boy.

01:28:29.719 --> 01:28:31.639
Do you mind? I seem to...

01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:33.560
...have misplaced my knife.

01:29:37.959 --> 01:29:39.349
Bugger!

01:29:46.791 --> 01:29:47.791
Thank you, Billy.

01:29:56.208 --> 01:29:58.274
Oh!

01:30:54.467 --> 01:30:56.129
I hope that's
not your blood, Lassen.

01:30:57.235 --> 01:30:58.895
I hope so too.

01:31:05.275 --> 01:31:06.870
Okay, boys, cast off.

01:31:06.871 --> 01:31:08.151
Let's get this ship out of here.

01:31:15.915 --> 01:31:19.317
Go on. Go on...

01:31:19.794 --> 01:31:21.253
Go on!

01:31:25.127 --> 01:31:27.628
There's three
more rooms just like this one.

01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:30.130
That should stop the U-boats
for the next six months.

01:31:31.967 --> 01:31:33.369
Let's get this thing
towed out of here.

01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:34.997
We are here, boys.

01:31:35.099 --> 01:31:36.675
Quietly. Let's set a warning.

01:31:42.845 --> 01:31:44.008
I need you to go
to the front of the boat

01:31:44.009 --> 01:31:45.977
and attach the Vulcan
to the Duchessa,

01:31:46.079 --> 01:31:47.283
Lassen and I
will head to the bridge.

01:31:47.284 --> 01:31:49.149
Okay.

01:31:50.754 --> 01:31:52.789
Take the right side.

01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:54.710
And you, get up there
and get this thing started.

01:32:06.974 --> 01:32:08.003
It's Gus.

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:10.740
Everyone's in place.

01:32:13.606 --> 01:32:14.975
What,

01:32:14.976 --> 01:32:16.896
you didn't actually think
it would work, did you?

01:32:17.986 --> 01:32:18.986
It was your plan.

01:32:20.011 --> 01:32:21.043
Well, let's make sure

01:32:21.145 --> 01:32:22.779
we keep our end of the bargain.

01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:24.415
Signal back and I'll heave off.

01:32:27.128 --> 01:32:28.789
So, what happens now?

01:32:28.790 --> 01:32:30.427
We wait for
the anchor chain to blow.

01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:32.265
When do
we expect that to happen?

01:32:32.367 --> 01:32:34.332
Shortly, I hope.

01:32:34.333 --> 01:32:36.625
And then we're free to take her.

01:32:36.626 --> 01:32:41.102
However, the real race begins
once the fuel depot goes.

01:32:41.204 --> 01:32:43.434
Then we'll have every soldier
on the island turning up.

01:32:45.678 --> 01:32:47.779
We don't wanna
be around to witness that.

01:32:49.348 --> 01:32:50.645
How long was that fuse

01:32:50.646 --> 01:32:51.926
you attached
to the anchor chain?

01:32:53.221 --> 01:32:54.296
We'll find out soon enough.

01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.333
Wait for it,
you're gonna catch the rope.

01:33:08.679 --> 01:33:09.694
Come on.

01:33:29.619 --> 01:33:30.954
First domino falls.

01:33:32.890 --> 01:33:34.368
- Hitch up the other line.
- Yes, boss.

01:33:34.392 --> 01:33:35.420
Pick up the slack.

01:33:37.722 --> 01:33:39.962
They need to move her
before the fuel dump blows.

01:33:41.433 --> 01:33:43.180
Heron, we need Marjorie.

01:33:43.181 --> 01:33:44.928
Leave Marjorie to me.

01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:46.167
We'll catch you up.

01:33:47.041 --> 01:33:48.070
Very good.

01:33:48.768 --> 01:33:49.921
Let's go!

01:34:34.412 --> 01:34:35.953
I have to say, Fraulein,

01:34:38.621 --> 01:34:39.649
you were good.

01:34:41.085 --> 01:34:42.652
And you were sly.

01:34:43.861 --> 01:34:45.561
There are only
two types of people

01:34:45.663 --> 01:34:47.657
that are as sly as the fox.

01:34:48.828 --> 01:34:49.828
The German

01:34:51.138 --> 01:34:52.464
and the Jew.

01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:59.537
And you are not German.

01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:02.344
I think now it's time...

01:35:04.509 --> 01:35:06.348
...for a real party.

01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:19.224
That wasn't
supposed to happen yet.

01:35:23.962 --> 01:35:25.101
Shackle her!

01:35:25.998 --> 01:35:26.998
And follow me.

01:35:30.576 --> 01:35:32.178
The harbor is under attack!

01:35:52.498 --> 01:35:53.525
They're coming.

01:35:58.604 --> 01:35:59.905
We need power on the engine.

01:36:04.536 --> 01:36:06.736
- She's too heavy!
- Pick up the slack!

01:36:18.624 --> 01:36:20.405
Wait...

01:36:24.190 --> 01:36:25.670
She's not moving!

01:36:26.731 --> 01:36:29.300
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:36:29.402 --> 01:36:30.368
Wait for it.

01:36:51.417 --> 01:36:53.553
We need
more power on the engine.

01:36:53.554 --> 01:36:55.691
Give me more power! More power!

01:36:57.222 --> 01:36:58.590
That's it, it's working!

01:36:59.731 --> 01:37:00.776
That's it!

01:37:27.924 --> 01:37:29.004
Ready!

01:37:50.508 --> 01:37:52.268
Haysey!

01:38:52.008 --> 01:38:53.705
We're out of range now.

01:38:55.607 --> 01:38:57.115
I'm no expert.

01:38:57.217 --> 01:38:59.650
But you've got a big old hole
in your shoulder, Haysey.

01:39:47.766 --> 01:39:49.395
Captain,

01:39:49.396 --> 01:39:51.664
would you explain to me
what's going on here?

01:39:52.902 --> 01:39:54.872
The power is gone.

01:39:54.974 --> 01:39:57.302
The fuel depot
has been sabotaged.

01:39:57.405 --> 01:39:58.555
And no one knows
what's happening.

01:39:58.579 --> 01:39:59.675
But this is your fault.

01:39:59.777 --> 01:40:01.014
Where is my ship?

01:40:02.948 --> 01:40:04.543
The Duchessa, where did it go?

01:40:04.645 --> 01:40:06.811
Someone's taken him
while you weren't looking.

01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:09.280
You idiot!

01:40:09.281 --> 01:40:10.820
You always have to say something

01:40:10.821 --> 01:40:12.652
at the very wrong time.

01:40:13.927 --> 01:40:16.557
There is never
a right time with you!

01:40:17.632 --> 01:40:18.896
Your greed and perversion

01:40:18.897 --> 01:40:20.962
has distracted you
from your duties.

01:40:20.963 --> 01:40:22.732
Now my harbor is destroyed.

01:40:22.834 --> 01:40:24.169
And my ship is gone!

01:40:28.007 --> 01:40:30.839
And now you're gone too.
Thank you.

01:40:59.035 --> 01:41:00.035
Impressive.

01:41:03.142 --> 01:41:04.267
Sounds like
your detonators worked.

01:41:41.506 --> 01:41:43.611
Chapeau, mademoiselle.

01:41:43.713 --> 01:41:46.944
You play well.
You really are the vixen.

01:41:48.279 --> 01:41:49.279
Am I?

01:41:51.088 --> 01:41:52.752
Well, my hand's been revealed.

01:41:56.564 --> 01:41:58.795
So, what now?

01:41:58.897 --> 01:42:02.792
Now, I possess your hand

01:42:02.894 --> 01:42:04.896
and for everything
you have done to me,

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:09.639
I will visit
a thousand fold upon you.

01:42:16.914 --> 01:42:17.942
Yeah.

01:42:25.316 --> 01:42:26.316
But no.

01:42:40.005 --> 01:42:41.438
Lie down.

01:42:45.241 --> 01:42:48.137
Gus, we can't wait much longer.

01:42:51.751 --> 01:42:52.847
They're coming.

01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:54.479
If we stay here,

01:42:54.582 --> 01:42:56.622
we'll lose contact
with the others.

01:42:56.623 --> 01:42:58.584
Hold fast, Billy.

01:42:58.585 --> 01:43:01.221
Heron has a way of surviving
and Marjorie,

01:43:01.323 --> 01:43:03.988
well... good luck with that.

01:43:09.301 --> 01:43:11.061
That's a patrol boat
coming towards us.

01:43:15.604 --> 01:43:17.284
Gus, we need to leave. Now.

01:43:18.436 --> 01:43:19.575
Hold on...

01:43:31.988 --> 01:43:33.017
It's them.

01:43:34.453 --> 01:43:35.855
RH.

01:43:36.995 --> 01:43:39.163
- KB.
- Marjorie.

01:43:39.164 --> 01:43:41.432
Overdressed and underdressed
at the same time.

01:43:44.469 --> 01:43:46.229
Come on, let's get you
out of those shackles.

01:43:51.776 --> 01:43:53.976
Come in, Violet.

01:43:53.977 --> 01:43:55.204
Calling H.M.S. Violet.

01:43:56.817 --> 01:43:58.039
Come in, Violet.

01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.378
This is Maid Honor.

01:43:59.379 --> 01:44:00.385
Go ahead, Maid Honor.

01:44:01.416 --> 01:44:03.377
Loudspeaker.

01:44:03.378 --> 01:44:05.027
Sorry to bother you
at this time of the night,

01:44:05.051 --> 01:44:06.652
but we've found ourselves
with one or two items

01:44:06.653 --> 01:44:07.933
that might be
of interest to you.

01:44:09.163 --> 01:44:10.593
Shall we rendezvous
for a handover?

01:44:12.195 --> 01:44:13.657
Get me Admiral Pound.

01:44:23.371 --> 01:44:25.001
- Yes?
- Sir,

01:44:25.002 --> 01:44:27.308
- good news and bad news.
- Yes, yes. Get to it.

01:44:27.309 --> 01:44:29.040
Bad news, they didn't sink her.

01:44:29.848 --> 01:44:30.910
Good news,

01:44:31.686 --> 01:44:32.686
they stole her.

01:44:34.119 --> 01:44:36.182
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

01:45:04.577 --> 01:45:05.577
Hold it there!

01:45:06.753 --> 01:45:08.019
Commander.

01:45:08.121 --> 01:45:09.579
You were ordered
by Admiral Pound

01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:10.722
to cease activities.

01:45:10.723 --> 01:45:12.751
You did not.

01:45:12.752 --> 01:45:14.254
Therefore, you are
to be returned to England

01:45:14.255 --> 01:45:16.822
to face a tribunal. You.

01:45:16.925 --> 01:45:20.264
Return to your tug
with the rest of your militia.

01:45:20.265 --> 01:45:21.593
- Take them to the brig.
- Sir!

01:45:21.594 --> 01:45:24.361
Good to see you too, Commander.

01:45:24.464 --> 01:45:26.316
Separate cells.

01:45:26.317 --> 01:45:28.170
Follow me!

01:45:28.272 --> 01:45:29.804
Let's go! Let's get moving!

01:45:31.679 --> 01:45:32.941
- RH.
- KB.

01:45:32.942 --> 01:45:34.204
Come on.

01:45:35.683 --> 01:45:37.046
Go on, move.

01:45:37.148 --> 01:45:38.148
One moment, seaman.

01:45:42.282 --> 01:45:43.312
Billy.

01:45:45.751 --> 01:45:46.791
One eye on the boundary...

01:45:48.522 --> 01:45:49.522
One eye on the pub.

01:45:51.759 --> 01:45:53.322
They'll thank you
for this one day.

01:45:54.196 --> 01:45:55.597
I'm not sure

01:45:55.598 --> 01:45:57.438
that's what we were
really looking for, was it,

01:45:58.366 --> 01:45:59.366
Your Highness?

01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.904
Shop's open
for you anytime, Major.

01:46:14.816 --> 01:46:16.452
Sorry to intrude,
Prime Minister,

01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:17.819
but M thought
you should see this.

01:46:23.459 --> 01:46:24.619
Thank you, Gloria.

01:46:34.737 --> 01:46:37.234
Line up. Face front!

01:46:38.473 --> 01:46:43.276
Line up. Face front!

01:46:43.378 --> 01:46:44.450
No need to shout.

01:46:47.889 --> 01:46:49.647
Stand still!

01:46:49.648 --> 01:46:51.380
Any chance of a cup of tea?

01:46:52.356 --> 01:46:53.716
You, back up to the wall.

01:46:53.818 --> 01:46:54.955
Off the cloth, moth.

01:46:56.194 --> 01:46:57.287
Stand straight!

01:47:08.838 --> 01:47:10.736
Never before
have the senior Military

01:47:10.838 --> 01:47:12.807
and Navy Commanders
of this country

01:47:12.808 --> 01:47:14.777
been so united
in their condemnation.

01:47:15.707 --> 01:47:17.080
It is their view

01:47:17.182 --> 01:47:18.841
that the discipline

01:47:18.842 --> 01:47:21.715
on which
our armed forces depends

01:47:21.716 --> 01:47:24.720
has been undermined
by men serving no master

01:47:24.721 --> 01:47:27.724
but their own thirst
for blood, murder and mayhem.

01:47:30.097 --> 01:47:31.559
Men who disobeyed a direct order

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.040
from the Admiral
of the fleet himself,

01:47:34.935 --> 01:47:35.935
and chose instead

01:47:36.895 --> 01:47:38.427
to trust the whim and intuition

01:47:39.865 --> 01:47:41.430
of the man standing beside him.

01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:44.433
How dare they.

01:47:47.113 --> 01:47:49.613
When only this morning,

01:47:49.715 --> 01:47:52.911
the first American soldiers
arrived on British soil,

01:47:52.912 --> 01:47:54.260
ready to stand
shoulder to shoulder

01:47:54.284 --> 01:47:55.312
with us in Europe.

01:47:57.052 --> 01:47:59.250
Allies who risked death
crossing the North Atlantic,

01:48:00.951 --> 01:48:02.627
and only by some miracle

01:48:04.598 --> 01:48:08.094
found their crossing
untroubled by Nazi U-boats.

01:48:10.568 --> 01:48:12.461
A happy circumstance,
I might add,

01:48:13.833 --> 01:48:16.167
which cannot be accounted for,

01:48:16.269 --> 01:48:18.769
but which has cleared the way
for the United States

01:48:18.770 --> 01:48:20.770
to enter the European war.

01:48:20.771 --> 01:48:22.480
And for which I know

01:48:22.583 --> 01:48:26.277
President Roosevelt
to be immeasurably grateful.

01:48:29.913 --> 01:48:31.047
But setting aside

01:48:31.149 --> 01:48:34.392
this stroke
of unexplained fortune,

01:48:34.494 --> 01:48:37.557
what is to be done
with this unruly company

01:48:37.558 --> 01:48:39.143
who do not obey orders?

01:48:39.144 --> 01:48:40.728
Who seem to have formed

01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:44.631
their own ministry
of ungentlemanly warfare.

01:48:49.539 --> 01:48:51.203
From now on, they work for me.
