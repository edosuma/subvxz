WEBVTT

01:25.127 --> 01:28.046
Here. Eat it while it's hot.

01:30.883 --> 01:33.051
- I had fun last night.
- Me too.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.054
I was talking about the movie, obviously.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.222
Yeah, of course.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.312
So…

01:43.395 --> 01:45.856
first day back at the hospital.
You nervous?

01:46.481 --> 01:47.733
A bit.

01:47.816 --> 01:52.070
Hey. I'm proud of you for doing this.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.033
Thanks. I mean it.

01:57.784 --> 02:01.663
Okay. I will see you later tonight.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.499
I've got that dinner thing with Caroline.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.668
Right. Right. Say hi for me.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.882
You're gonna be great.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.849
Love you.

02:20.933 --> 02:21.934
I love you.

03:06.103 --> 03:09.523
<i>Next stop, Civic Center.
Civic Center is the next stop.</i>

03:11.900 --> 03:14.194
<i>I am so glad
you decided to come back, Sophie.</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:17.239
You know most
of the rich philanthropists' wives

03:17.322 --> 03:20.409
we get around here just want to brag
about getting their hands dirty,

03:20.909 --> 03:24.121
but you always took the time to connect
with the patients. Hear their stories.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.415
They all felt like they knew you,
right away.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.084
That's so nice of you to say.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.503
You seem like
you're in a much better place.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.507
All right, can you go in here?

03:35.591 --> 03:37.634
Yep. It's self-inflicted.
Pulse weak and thready.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.282
Sir, which way are you taking us?

04:05.537 --> 04:07.873
You need to get out of this lane.

04:07.956 --> 04:11.251
- This is the best way. Don't worry.
- No, but-- No, you don't understand.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.171
This way goes over the bridge.
I can't go over the water.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.007
Just pull over, please.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.303
Let me out.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.767
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Let me out of the car!

04:26.850 --> 04:29.269
All right. There. All right.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.771
Unlocked. Go.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.444
Get out of the road.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.364
- Bitch, move.
- Fuck you!

04:40.447 --> 04:41.990
…hell out the way!

04:56.922 --> 04:58.549
I had the dream again last night.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.425
It's the first memory you have.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.594
You're gonna come back to it
again and again,

05:02.678 --> 05:04.721
however painful it may be.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.015
If I could just get back that one moment.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.978
Sophie, you know that
your injuries make that impossible.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.856
This is part of your condition.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.900
You have to accept
that most of your memories

05:16.984 --> 05:18.235
will never be recovered.

05:21.780 --> 05:26.118
Do you know what it feels like
to not remember anything?

05:27.786 --> 05:30.706
It's like I've woken up
in someone else's life

05:32.416 --> 05:36.253
and everyone around me is walking around
as though nothing's changed.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.797
Have you told James how you feel?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.550
I couldn't even tell him
what happened today.

05:42.885 --> 05:46.096
There is a new therapy,
something called neurofeedback.

05:46.638 --> 05:50.309
It could help with these panic attacks.
I could get you in.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.102
Sure, can't hurt.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.481
I wanna tell you something

05:56.565 --> 05:58.984
but I don't want you to take it
the wrong way.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.321
Okay.

06:05.490 --> 06:08.660
There are a lot of ways
to try to kill yourself.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.915
You jumped off of a boat
into the middle of the fucking ocean.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.418
The fact that you survived is a miracle.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.045
You set out to do something

06:18.128 --> 06:22.716
and you did it in the most intense,
deliberate way possible.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.427
That tells me something about you.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.347
You are determined.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.476
That determination,
that's what's gonna help you

06:32.559 --> 06:33.644
move on from this.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.479
But how can I move on

06:35.562 --> 06:37.731
when I don't even remember
making that choice?

06:38.357 --> 06:40.025
Let's try this.

06:40.108 --> 06:44.321
Tell me,
what's so wrong with your situation?

06:44.821 --> 06:50.410
You have a beautiful home,
friends, a husband who wants to love you.

06:50.494 --> 06:53.038
Exactly. That's what I don't understand.

06:53.121 --> 06:57.459
If my life was so perfect,
why did I try to end it?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.775
Is that the second bottle or the third?

08:04.276 --> 08:05.485
Who's counting?

08:07.196 --> 08:10.282
I mean, being married is nice and all,
but the whole thing's a little monotonous.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.366
If you catch my drift.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.784
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

08:12.868 --> 08:13.952
Yeah, that's it. Thank you.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.788
Sophie, I can't believe you're here.
It's just so nice to see you.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.749
- You look gorgeous.
- Honestly.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.292
Have you lost weight?

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
She got a Peloton.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.925
A Peloton? Oh, my God!

08:28.008 --> 08:29.635
You have a Peloton, right?

08:29.718 --> 08:31.553
- Oh, my God. I had to get one.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

08:31.637 --> 08:34.847
So, is this who I used to spend time with,
these women?

08:35.474 --> 08:36.475
Yeah. Why?

08:37.934 --> 08:41.313
I just don't feel a connection.
That's all.

08:41.938 --> 08:46.276
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but you don't have any other friends.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.572
Nobody likes you. You're very pretty.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.703
Okay, there is this guy at the bar

08:56.787 --> 08:59.164
that has been scoping you out
the entire night.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.128
You're being ridiculous.

09:05.671 --> 09:06.797
I don't think so.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.049
You think you know him?

09:15.681 --> 09:16.974
No.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.012
You're up early.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.389
Couldn't sleep.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.019
What's that?

10:45.729 --> 10:46.813
I don't know.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.149
Had it in the back.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.027
You like it?

10:55.489 --> 11:01.537
I'm just not used to seeing you
in something so daring.

11:04.831 --> 11:08.252
You know, I always loved…

11:10.254 --> 11:11.463
this one.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.301
It really suits you.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.179
What's this for?

11:20.472 --> 11:22.015
The investors event at the firm.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.059
I found the invitation.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.353
I figured you wouldn't be up for it.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.021
Let's go.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.190
Really?

11:30.274 --> 11:34.027
Yeah. You were right.
I need to get back out there.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.823
This is gonna be fun, I promise.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.910
You know--
You probably don't remember this

11:41.994 --> 11:46.290
but… I'm a fantastic dancer.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.709
You want to see?

11:49.793 --> 11:53.922
It's like a shoulder dance.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.510
Wear the one with the flowers, okay?

11:59.553 --> 12:00.637
I'll see you tonight.

13:02.866 --> 13:03.867
Sophie.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.788
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

13:08.622 --> 13:09.623
Yeah.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.167
You were at the restaurant.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.044
We need to talk.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.380
Who are you?

13:16.964 --> 13:18.173
Your husband's coming.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.344
Look, he's not who you think he is, okay?

13:24.263 --> 13:25.806
He's not telling you everything.

13:26.515 --> 13:27.766
What are you talking about?

13:27.850 --> 13:30.310
You ever think there's more
to what happened on the boat that day?

13:35.190 --> 13:37.442
Left on Fremont Street, yeah? Thanks.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.405
Who was that?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.451
Soph, who were you talking to?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.955
Just some guy wanted directions.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.333
Okay. Come on.

14:12.936 --> 14:13.979
You okay?

14:18.150 --> 14:19.359
Yeah. Why?

14:20.027 --> 14:22.696
Well, you just seem a little shaken up.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.407
I'm fine.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.534
- Yeah?
- Let's go.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.049
How about a drink?
You want some champagne?

14:42.716 --> 14:45.928
James. Sophie. You made it.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.513
It's been a long time.

14:49.765 --> 14:51.391
This place is so beautiful.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.977
Yes. Of course.

14:55.562 --> 14:59.066
What a lovely idea to have a party here.
I never would have thought of it.

15:03.445 --> 15:05.697
I'm just going to excuse myself.

15:05.781 --> 15:08.909
I'm sure you guys
want to talk business, anyway.

15:08.992 --> 15:09.993
You okay?

15:17.000 --> 15:19.127
Didn't you guys get married here?

15:21.129 --> 15:22.172
Yes.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.584
Can't believe you showed.

15:58.667 --> 15:59.668
How you holding up?

16:00.377 --> 16:03.630
Good. I know this sounds crazy, but…

16:04.423 --> 16:07.634
sometimes I feel like
this whole thing was our second chance.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.469
- You know?
- Uh-huh.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.555
Well, we get to reinvent ourselves.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.516
You know, forget all the mistakes
we made before and start again, it's--

16:14.600 --> 16:15.434
I don't know, man.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.853
I would have gotten the fuck out
a long time ago, but--

16:17.936 --> 16:20.063
- Yeah, well…
- Hey, I'm an asshole.

16:20.147 --> 16:21.023
Yep.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.402
Hey.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.155
Sophie. Love the dress.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.201
You're looking at me funny. What did I do?

16:32.284 --> 16:33.285
What? No, I'm not.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.330
Your champagne. I'm sorry.

16:36.914 --> 16:37.998
Excuse me.

18:24.605 --> 18:25.981
What happened?

18:27.649 --> 18:30.444
You jumped, dear. You jumped.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.812
Sophie, I heard you were back.
How are you?

19:46.895 --> 19:47.938
Good, thanks.

19:48.021 --> 19:52.067
744. 602.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.113
Long night?

19:56.196 --> 19:58.448
Back-end of a double. I'm a zombie.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.661
It's dead up here. Go get a coffee.
I'll watch the desk.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.580
Thank you.

21:17.152 --> 21:20.364
Jesus, Sophie.
Didn't you see that call light going off?

21:21.198 --> 21:22.950
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.326
Don't worry about it.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.578
It's probably just Mr. Greene
wanting more juice.

21:26.662 --> 21:28.956
I'll go check on him. Sorry again.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.715
How was the hospital?

21:43.428 --> 21:44.429
Fine.

21:45.848 --> 21:49.434
Boring, actually. Slow day.

21:52.646 --> 21:54.147
You want some more?

21:57.734 --> 21:59.486
I need to talk to you about something.

22:04.116 --> 22:05.868
Victoria called yesterday.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.913
Needed your driver's license number.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.417
Said you were going to Seattle.

22:14.251 --> 22:18.172
Well, they wanted me to go, but I said no.

22:18.255 --> 22:22.509
It's been five months, James.
You can't babysit me forever.

22:22.593 --> 22:25.012
I just don't think
that now is the right time.

22:29.308 --> 22:30.976
I need you to know something.

22:32.394 --> 22:37.566
What happened before will never,
ever happen again.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.988
The girl who did that,
I don't even recognize.

22:44.448 --> 22:48.827
However fucked up I might be,
I don't want to die.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.793
I know.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.795
Then you should go.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.722
You would call Caroline, right?

23:08.805 --> 23:10.224
If anything happened.

23:11.558 --> 23:15.229
It's a two-hour flight, James.
I'll be okay.

23:18.649 --> 23:21.527
Okay. I'll tell Victoria.

23:28.325 --> 23:30.702
There's a flight in the morning.
I'll have her book it.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.177
Neurofeedback therapy
isn't going to replace

23:47.261 --> 23:51.014
your other coping mechanisms,
like exercise and talk therapy.

23:51.098 --> 23:53.600
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

23:53.684 --> 23:55.853
Great. There's no drugs involved.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.563
It's all mental and physiological,

23:57.646 --> 24:01.066
so what I need from you, Sophie,
is to answer honestly.

24:02.276 --> 24:03.277
Of course.

24:03.861 --> 24:05.237
Okay.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.739
So, Sophie, how are you feeling today?

24:08.574 --> 24:09.575
Fine.

24:10.284 --> 24:11.952
On a scale of one to ten,

24:12.035 --> 24:14.413
what would you say
your level of anxiety is?

24:17.583 --> 24:18.584
Three.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.713
Let's revisit the last time
you experienced a trigger.

24:23.922 --> 24:26.008
What was it that brought on the anxiety?

24:30.095 --> 24:33.265
I was revisiting the trauma.

24:34.183 --> 24:35.017
Don't look.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.644
What would you say
your level of anxiety is now?

24:38.478 --> 24:39.605
You jumped.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.566
Five.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.276
Okay, great.

24:46.111 --> 24:47.362
Now close your eyes.

24:48.864 --> 24:53.994
Imagine yourself in a garden.
Flowers. Birds chirping.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.964
- What are you seeing there?
- Sorry?

25:07.508 --> 25:10.302
Are you able to tell
what's going on inside my head?

25:10.886 --> 25:12.137
Not exactly.

25:12.221 --> 25:15.724
It's more like
a visual representation of activity.

25:18.727 --> 25:19.728
Too bad.

25:25.150 --> 25:30.072
All right. I'm in a garden, flowers--

25:31.156 --> 25:32.157
What else was it?

25:32.241 --> 25:35.786
- Birds.
- Right. Birds.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.686
Hi.

26:00.769 --> 26:02.938
Caroline, what are you doing here?

26:03.021 --> 26:05.190
I thought you'd be bored,
so I brought booze.

26:06.942 --> 26:08.485
Sorry, is it too late?

26:10.529 --> 26:13.156
Did James ask you to check up on me?

26:13.949 --> 26:14.950
No.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.703
Yes.

26:17.786 --> 26:21.206
Sorry, I can't lie to you.
Come on. Come eat.

26:21.290 --> 26:24.626
So, what have you been doing
with the house all to yourself?

26:24.710 --> 26:27.421
I don't know. Trying to relax.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.343
Can I ask you something?

26:34.845 --> 26:35.846
Yeah, sure.

26:39.141 --> 26:41.602
I was at this doctor's appointment
the other day

26:41.685 --> 26:44.521
and you know how they run through
your medical history and all that?

26:44.605 --> 26:48.108
Well, she asked me how my arm was healing.

26:48.942 --> 26:49.985
Okay.

26:50.068 --> 26:53.780
Turns out I broke it
maybe a year and a half ago.

26:54.364 --> 26:56.617
Of course, I have no memory of it at all.

26:59.703 --> 27:01.038
Do you?

27:01.705 --> 27:03.373
Sure, I do. I was there.

27:04.499 --> 27:05.501
You were?

27:05.584 --> 27:11.048
You and I were shopping,
and we'd had a couple of drinks at brunch.

27:11.673 --> 27:16.720
And we were strolling down Maiden Lane,

27:16.803 --> 27:20.974
and you tripped right in front of Chanel.

27:21.808 --> 27:22.976
Seriously?

27:23.060 --> 27:26.438
Yeah, the manager was in quite a state.
He thought you'd sue.

27:26.939 --> 27:30.817
Anyway, I took you in for the X-ray.
And then by the time they put the cast on,

27:30.901 --> 27:33.278
you forced me to leave
and tend to the gallery and--

27:34.071 --> 27:35.739
and swore me to secrecy.

27:38.075 --> 27:40.285
I mean, it's such a silly story really.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.210
Sophie, is something wrong?

27:49.586 --> 27:54.174
No, it's nothing, really.

28:02.641 --> 28:05.435
Sometimes it's hard
not knowing your own secrets.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.527
<i>Hey, babe.</i>

28:13.610 --> 28:16.989
<i>I know it's late. It's been a long day
and I just got back to the hotel.</i>

28:18.031 --> 28:22.077
<i>It's weird going to bed without you.
I hate it.</i>

28:22.911 --> 28:26.164
<i>I left you something by the record player.
Take a look.</i>

28:26.874 --> 28:30.335
<i>Anyway, two more days. Love you, Soph.</i>

31:44.446 --> 31:45.739
The usual.

32:10.264 --> 32:11.431
Are you following me?

32:13.725 --> 32:15.936
Tell me who you are, right now.

32:23.193 --> 32:24.778
You really don't remember, do you?

32:24.862 --> 32:26.738
Remember what?

32:31.743 --> 32:35.372
I'm Officer Thomas Baden.
I was assigned to your case.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.252
I didn't realize the police were involved.

32:40.878 --> 32:42.087
Routine investigation.

32:42.171 --> 32:44.590
All suicides gotta get cleared
for foul play.

32:50.262 --> 32:53.265
Why did you say that about my husband?

32:54.391 --> 32:57.352
It's usually the person who's closest
to the victim that's responsible.

32:57.436 --> 32:58.937
But I'm not a victim.

32:59.021 --> 33:01.023
That's only because you survived.

33:02.900 --> 33:05.360
You know, I realized something
the other night when I saw you.

33:05.444 --> 33:10.574
There's just this feeling I have
about your case, something I can't shake.

33:11.408 --> 33:12.409
What feeling?

33:12.492 --> 33:16.580
People with perfect lives
don't usually jump off of ferries.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.373
My life is far from perfect.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.001
I know.

33:29.051 --> 33:30.928
You used to love this place.

33:33.722 --> 33:35.766
You said it was named after a famous poet.

33:36.475 --> 33:39.228
A guy who spent his whole life drinking,
until he drowned.

33:41.146 --> 33:44.775
He jumped off a boat into the river.

33:47.319 --> 33:49.154
You seem to know quite a lot about me.

33:52.574 --> 33:56.161
Thank you, Officer,
but I don't need your help.

34:11.260 --> 34:13.804
How was the neurofeedback?

34:13.887 --> 34:15.472
Do you think it could be helpful?

34:17.891 --> 34:20.893
Maybe. Can't hurt, right?

34:24.648 --> 34:27.150
Lately, I've been having memories.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.612
New ones. Things I haven't seen before.

34:31.697 --> 34:35.993
It's natural for details to come back,
especially around the trauma.

34:38.996 --> 34:43.625
What I saw happened right before.

34:46.170 --> 34:48.964
Do you remember when I told you
about the ictus,

34:49.047 --> 34:50.716
way back when we started?

34:50.799 --> 34:56.972
The catalyst. The moment that your injury
essentially rebooted your brain.

34:57.054 --> 35:01.476
When you opened your eyes in that water,
you were reborn.

35:02.186 --> 35:07.316
Anything that comes back
before that moment, you can't trust.

35:07.399 --> 35:11.862
So there's never a chance,
not even the tiniest sliver,

35:11.945 --> 35:14.281
that I will ever get back that moment?

35:14.364 --> 35:16.325
The moment before I jumped?

35:16.408 --> 35:19.578
Someday, maybe. Probably not.

35:19.661 --> 35:22.164
The oldest memories have the best chance,

35:22.247 --> 35:26.210
the newest, close to impossible.

35:30.631 --> 35:35.969
Sophie, it's time to move forward.
Face your fears.

35:36.053 --> 35:39.431
You have to stop focusing on the trauma,

35:39.515 --> 35:42.017
you're giving it more power
than it deserves.

35:42.100 --> 35:44.311
But don't you think knowing
what really happened

35:44.394 --> 35:45.395
would change everything?

35:45.479 --> 35:46.730
We do know.

35:46.813 --> 35:51.985
No, we think we know,
based on what we think happened.

35:52.069 --> 35:58.116
You had been hurting for a long time,
you said so yourself.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.662
Whatever made you this way,
it happened a long time ago.

36:02.329 --> 36:04.331
Those are your own words.

36:04.414 --> 36:06.124
And now you're using them against me.

36:10.629 --> 36:13.257
Maybe you need to stop
being so afraid of them.

36:19.388 --> 36:22.891
"Whatever made me this way
happened a long time ago.

36:24.059 --> 36:28.146
I don't know what happens after today,
after I cross the sea alone.

36:28.981 --> 36:30.941
<i>But it's a chance I've got to take.</i>

36:32.276 --> 36:37.030
<i>Go find a new life without me.
This one just isn't mine.</i>

36:38.740 --> 36:40.325
<i>This one just isn't mine."</i>

36:54.631 --> 36:58.552
There you are. I got the last flight home.

36:59.428 --> 37:01.388
I didn't want to spend
another night without you.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.099
Sophie?

37:06.560 --> 37:09.980
You're reading the suicide note.
Where'd you find it?

37:11.857 --> 37:12.858
I don't know.

37:14.193 --> 37:16.904
I thought we agreed to put that behind us.

37:23.869 --> 37:26.455
Maybe that's easier for you than for me.

37:27.831 --> 37:30.792
You know what happened. You were there.

37:32.961 --> 37:36.840
For me, it's all… a blur.

37:46.892 --> 37:48.644
You wanna know what happened,
I'll tell you.

37:50.771 --> 37:52.523
It was the shittiest day of my life.

37:55.192 --> 37:59.029
I got a call that my wife
was in critical condition,

37:59.821 --> 38:02.574
that she tried to end her own life.

38:04.868 --> 38:07.204
A life I thought was pretty damn good.

38:10.749 --> 38:15.587
I was just praying that I would
make it back home before you died

38:15.671 --> 38:18.590
so I could at least say goodbye.

38:23.178 --> 38:24.304
You weren't here?

38:24.388 --> 38:27.933
No. I was in Portland, working.

38:30.435 --> 38:31.645
You know that, Soph.

38:49.538 --> 38:52.040
I spent that first night
holding your hand.

38:56.211 --> 38:58.922
Thinking that if I just kept holding on…

39:02.885 --> 39:04.011
maybe you'd be okay.

39:05.137 --> 39:06.680
You never told me that.

39:08.223 --> 39:09.766
No, of course not.

39:15.230 --> 39:16.940
Because I wanted to forget it.

39:25.199 --> 39:28.911
Look, whatever happened,

39:30.162 --> 39:34.583
whatever made you feel like
that was the only way out, it's done now.

39:35.918 --> 39:36.919
It's over.

39:40.047 --> 39:43.300
It doesn't matter anymore.
It never did, okay?

41:52.846 --> 41:54.264
<i>What are you doin'?</i>

41:55.807 --> 41:57.601
<i>Get over here. Come on.</i>

41:59.061 --> 42:00.771
<i>This is a terrible idea.</i>

42:00.854 --> 42:04.942
<i>It's no big deal.
No one's ever gonna see it but us.</i>

42:16.495 --> 42:18.580
<i>You're no fun at all.</i>

42:33.053 --> 42:34.805
<i>Have you thought about what I said?</i>

42:36.557 --> 42:39.476
<i>You and me,
just the two of us somewhere warm.</i>

42:42.020 --> 42:43.188
<i>What am I supposed to do,</i>

42:43.272 --> 42:46.400
<i>just pack up and leave, write him a note?</i>

42:49.278 --> 42:51.613
<i>Just the two of us somewhere warm.</i>

42:55.492 --> 43:00.205
"Go find a new life without me.
This one just isn't mine."

43:01.123 --> 43:03.959
<i>You're no fun at all.</i>

43:28.692 --> 43:30.277
<i>You know the camera's still on?</i>

43:32.863 --> 43:34.072
<i>I know.</i>

44:21.286 --> 44:22.329
Sophie?

44:26.083 --> 44:27.251
What are you doin' here?

44:33.257 --> 44:35.551
When exactly were you gonna tell me
that we were fucking?

44:35.634 --> 44:38.053
Or was that piece of information
not relevant to your investigation?

44:38.887 --> 44:40.305
What was I supposed to do, walk up to you

44:40.389 --> 44:42.391
in the middle of the street,
outta nowhere,

44:42.474 --> 44:45.435
- and tell you we were having an affair?
- Is that what it was? An affair?

44:47.437 --> 44:50.566
Whatever we had is done.
Stay out of my life.

44:51.900 --> 44:52.901
I can't.

44:55.195 --> 44:56.196
What are you doing?

44:56.864 --> 45:00.450
Trying to frame my husband
for a crime that never happened?

45:00.534 --> 45:02.494
- So you can have a second chance?
- You don't know what happened.

45:02.578 --> 45:04.872
I jumped, that's it.

45:05.455 --> 45:09.543
That's the sad fucking truth.
I have to live with that, so do you.

45:10.836 --> 45:11.962
Leave me alone.

45:13.088 --> 45:14.131
Sophie!

46:04.473 --> 46:07.559
Excuse me. Hi, sorry to bother you.

46:08.477 --> 46:10.354
But do you remember me?

46:11.688 --> 46:14.691
It was a coast guard rescue
about five months ago.

46:15.943 --> 46:17.152
You're alive.

46:18.904 --> 46:21.323
We always wondered what happened.

46:24.535 --> 46:26.161
I just wondered…

46:28.330 --> 46:31.333
was there anything unusual about that day?

46:32.626 --> 46:33.627
What do you mean?

46:35.712 --> 46:39.675
Did I say anything strange?

46:42.386 --> 46:45.305
Listen, you were saying
all kinds of crazy things.

46:46.640 --> 46:48.350
A man pushed you from the boat.

46:49.935 --> 46:51.436
Your ID said one name,

46:51.520 --> 46:53.438
and you kept insisting
it was something else.

46:54.690 --> 46:58.151
Tess, you said your name was Tess.

46:59.361 --> 47:02.447
I never forgot that.
It's my daughter's name.

47:04.575 --> 47:07.035
Anyway, I wouldn't put
too much stock in it.

47:07.828 --> 47:10.080
You weren't in your right mind.
You know what I mean?

47:12.124 --> 47:16.962
It's so nice to see you looking so good.
A real fresh start.
