14:02.592 --> 14:03.752
How is that relevant?

14:04.219 --> 14:05.208
(SCOFFS)

14:06.638 --> 14:07.753
It's not.

14:12.436 --> 14:15.348
There's no powder residue.
Not on anybody's hands.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.851
Can't find Cantor's
shell casings either.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.021
That's not right.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.863
Does this fee! a little
Kent State to you?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.567
Failed student revolution?

14:25.949 --> 14:28.440
(SCOFFS) Never mind,
I don't even know
why I brought it up.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.780
(SIRENS BLARE)

14:34.499 --> 14:35.614
Mr. Randol.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.746
Do you have any reaction
to the shootings at
Lion's Gate University?

14:38.962 --> 14:40.748
Several of the victims
were your followers.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.462
Where's your outrage?

14:45.218 --> 14:47.174
You're gonna
twist this anyway.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.800
LGU students face a curriculum
driven by corporate needs,

14:51.141 --> 14:52.221
not by educational ones.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.800
When the students
try to point this out,
the police roll in.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.476
Where's my outrage?

14:57.856 --> 14:59.312
Where’s yours?

15:03.153 --> 15:07.146
Did you walk in there,
do your adorkable
boy genius thing,

15:07.240 --> 15:09.982
and the board of directors
was less than impressed?

15:10.327 --> 15:11.487
I bet you had notes.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.364
How far did you get?

15:13.789 --> 15:14.824
First card. (CHUCKLES)

15:15.290 --> 15:16.279
(GROANS)

15:17.459 --> 15:19.916
Alec, did you really think
they were gonna let you
march in here

15:20.003 --> 15:22.335
and play Steve Jobs
without a fight?

15:22.964 --> 15:24.249
Do you even own
a turtleneck?

15:24.674 --> 15:27.802
You need a shark to
take on these sharks.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.593
I suppose you
have a suggestion?

15:31.556 --> 15:34.343
Well, I wouldn't presume,

15:35.519 --> 15:37.680
though itwould be
nice to be asked.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.469
All right, look.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.346
The board has a weak hand.

15:41.817 --> 15:44.149
You know what you do
when you have a weak hand?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.275
You front.
You bully.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.070
You do anything
you need to convince
the other guy to fold.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.022
And stop buying

15:51.785 --> 15:54.276
suits off the rack.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.739
Listen to me.
I've read the dossiers
on these board members.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.246
There's no Kirk.
There's no Picard.

16:01.336 --> 16:02.951
They barely have a Geordi.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.286
Stop playing their game.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.588
How?

16:08.385 --> 16:12.253
Iguessthatsforyou
to figure out, genius.

16:13.557 --> 16:14.797
You're the one
with the oil.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.139
Convince them. Or

16:17.936 --> 16:20.348
find yourself a shark.

16:23.358 --> 16:26.646
No lead on the missing gun
or proof of Liber8 plots.

16:26.736 --> 16:27.896
Early days.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.650
The witnesses deny any shots
came from the crowd.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.735
Who's taking the lead
on Cantor's debrief?

16:32.826 --> 16:35.613
I am. One of the dead girls
was definitely Liber8?

16:35.704 --> 16:37.740
Yes, I can confirm
that personally.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.742
That's terrible, but it's
something at least.

16:39.958 --> 16:43.667
And I canvassed for
cell phone video and photos
from the scene, but...

16:43.753 --> 16:45.254
They were all disabled.

16:47.090 --> 16:49.251
I mean, that's
what it looks like.

16:49.759 --> 16:50.714
You're right.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.258
CARLOS: How would
somebody do that?

16:53.263 --> 16:55.174
Well, you can thank Piron.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.473
It's an experimental
geo-fencing solution.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.093
When the orders got given
to break up the demonstration,

17:05.984 --> 17:08.100
Huh. Well, that's
a nice trick.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.106
It seemed like
a good idea at the time.

17:10.906 --> 17:13.943
These are more names
from the university.
Iwant you back there.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.274
We're widening the net.

17:15.577 --> 17:16.692
I want that gun.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.614
Let's clear our man.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.722
Hey. Hey-

17:39.893 --> 17:41.929
You want me to book that in?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.802
Uh, no.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.388
No, I got it.
Okay, well, I'm just gonna

17:46.483 --> 17:48.314
try to narrow those
names for ya.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.904
Yeah.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.617
How many?

18:07.504 --> 18:08.744
They won't tell me.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.745
Three.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.749
Two at the scene.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.926
One was taken to
the trauma center but

18:17.305 --> 18:18.886
he didn't make it.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.553
What happens now?

18:24.020 --> 18:25.726
You haven't been
debriefed yet?

18:25.814 --> 18:27.896
Lieutenant said he wanted
to talk to me first.

18:41.413 --> 18:43.620
I need you to
give me the room.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.543
Yes, sir.

18:57.679 --> 18:59.169
I think Cantor was about
to tell me something.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.800
Stop right there.

19:01.683 --> 19:04.425
I can see the struggle
you're going through, Carlos.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.225
It doesn't have to
be like this.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.803
And how's it supposed to be?

19:10.191 --> 19:12.022
The system protects
the people, right?

19:12.694 --> 19:16.403
It's supposed to.
Then in order to
protect the people,

19:16.489 --> 19:18.229
we must protect the system.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.576
(CHUCKLES)
What about the truth?

19:23.997 --> 19:25.658
Where does that fit in?

19:25.749 --> 19:27.614
In 2077, when you're
on a CPS call,

19:27.751 --> 19:29.241
the whole thing
is recorded, right?

19:29.336 --> 19:31.122
Everything you see,
start to finish?

19:31.296 --> 19:33.127
Sent straight into
evidence and judgment.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.539
Well, we don't have
that certainty here.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.507
(SIGHS) Believe me,
that kind of certainty

19:38.803 --> 19:40.339
creates its own problems.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.669
(SCOFFS)

19:42.098 --> 19:45.966
Cantor has a family
and a future,

19:46.436 --> 19:50.020
and there are consequences
for what he did or didn't do.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.721
Now, whatever you suspect,

19:52.067 --> 19:55.230
before you run it up
the ladder, you have to be
sure of what you believe in.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.940
A slogan from 2077?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.275
Or what's in here.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.469
Aren't you tired of
being distorted?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.511
Why don't you have
a little bit of respect?

20:30.480 --> 20:32.141
I don't have anything to say.

who you're talking to.

Of course you have,

to the fire.

What if I wanted to say that
the victims this morning
were murdered?

20:58.341 --> 21:00.423
Because that's exactly
what it would be

21:00.552 --> 21:02.713
if the shooter wasn't
wearing a uniform.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.511
Are you suggesting
Officer Cantor was
ordered to kill them?

lot easier for you

much trouble you're in.
Okay.

it belongs to you.

a cop yesterday.

People died.
Hell of a video, though.

I found that in
the common room.

under his pillow.

seen that before.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.252
There's residue on it.
It's been fired twice.

Got any priors, PJ?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.000

Please, I swear,
I haven't done anything!

Get him out of here.
What?

22:32.227 --> 22:33.558
He didn't do anything, bro!

Heard you were at the scene
when they apprehended
the suspect.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.455
And just now I found out from

22:55.708 --> 22:59.246
Officer Cantor that you,
Fonnegra and Dillon were
the first to debrief him.

22:59.337 --> 23:00.952

with him very long.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.203
How did he seem?

23:02.799 --> 23:05.006
Fine.
Sure of his story?

the other officers
at the scene

23:07.971 --> 23:10.462
practically word for word.

you're getting at.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.589

One of the victims was Liber8,

23:15.812 --> 23:18.349
we got some cover
there, but still.

such a tidy story.

decided to lawyer-up.

We're gonna
keep him overnight.

23:48.511 --> 23:51.344
I saw him at the demo,
I scanned him with my CMR

residue on his hands.

can't be proved.

What's your take
on that report?

I think you're turning a
murderer into a hero and the
bodies aren't even cold yet.

Murderer's a strong word.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.455
Yeah, so is hero.

One of the victims,
Rebecca Barton,

25:45.461 --> 25:46.997
a follower of yours, correct?

25:47.964 --> 25:49.420
I wouldn't call her that, no.

25:49.507 --> 25:50.792
Why not?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.792
Because it takes courage
to think for yourself.
She did.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.634
Maybe she was there
as an agent provocateur.

25:55.722 --> 25:58.088
Maybe she was there
getting her master's degree.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.685
Are you seriously
suggesting Rebecca Barton
was assassinated?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.853
Yes, I am.
But they have
someone in custody.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.272
(SCOFFS) Come on.

26:08.818 --> 26:11.776
Of course they do. See?
It changed the entire
conversation.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.485
Hero cop,
roll to commercial.

26:13.573 --> 26:17.532
Rebecca Barton dared to
say that corporations
aren't people.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.154
They killed her for that.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.991
More with Julian Randol
after this.

26:24.834 --> 26:26.574
We're gonna have him back.

26:27.336 --> 26:28.837
You've got the gift, son.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.828
Oh, you are electric.

27:16.594 --> 27:19.677
I don't even know
what I'm doing half
the time anymore.

27:24.268 --> 27:25.257
(SIGHS)

27:26.479 --> 27:30.063
I sure as hell don't know
why I trust you more
than I do her.

27:31.359 --> 27:32.394
You?

27:33.736 --> 27:35.067
(CHUCKLES)

27:44.497 --> 27:46.078
(GIRL SOBBING)

27:47.792 --> 27:49.202
Agent Cameron?

27:49.794 --> 27:52.331
Thank you for meeting me.
Can we walk?

27:52.964 --> 27:56.047
You said you had information
vital to the case.

27:56.133 --> 27:59.170
We can't debate Liber8's aims
because it upsets endowments.

27:59.262 --> 28:03.255
Lobbyists write the laws,
companies drive the research.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.256
Isn't that inevitable?

28:05.393 --> 28:06.929
(SIGHS) That's
a good question.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.429
Look at the history
of your profession.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.637
I'm not getting out of here
without a lecture, am I?

28:11.732 --> 28:16.066
London, 1829, Robert Peel
forms the Metropolitan Police,

28:16.195 --> 28:18.982
the first modern force
responsive to the people.

28:19.073 --> 28:20.688
The whole 19th
century is a story

28:20.783 --> 28:23.900
of the police freeing
themselves from
political machines.

28:24.161 --> 28:25.537
Only when they're
independent

28:25.621 --> 28:29.034
are they free to ask
the right questions.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.788
Research is the same,
that's what we're
fighting for.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.123
That's why Liber8 finds
a sympathetic ear.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.671
(SIGHS) The answers
that you're looking for?

28:38.801 --> 28:40.086
They're right over there.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.425
He has something to tell you.

28:47.310 --> 28:50.973
I found the gun.
I thought I'd hold
onto it, maybe sell it.

28:51.314 --> 28:53.475
Becca told me
I had to get rid of it.
Did you?

28:53.816 --> 28:55.147
He brought it to me.

28:55.276 --> 28:58.359
I dumped it here, called
the police, tipped them off
and waited for them to arrive.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.611
DUNCAN: Look, I know
you two had history.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.481
But Becca wasn't bad,
she was an idealist,

29:03.868 --> 29:05.483
and now she's
a dead terrorist.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.494
She only gets to be
that one thing.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.326
I'm sorry for your loss.

29:15.963 --> 29:20.172
The gun didn't find its way
under that boy's pillow
until they put it there.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.688
Why did you call me?

29:37.526 --> 29:41.519
Something about you
tells me that you want
to ask the right questions.

30:25.533 --> 30:26.648
Carlos, do you have any idea

30:26.742 --> 30:29.654
why there's a bunch
of reporters outside
looking for us?

30:29.745 --> 30:31.906
I had to come through
the prisoner dock.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.492
Uh... Yeah, I meant to
call you about that.

30:34.583 --> 30:35.743
Julian's been busy.

30:36.293 --> 30:37.908
Thanks for the heads-up.

30:38.963 --> 30:42.547
(SIGHS) The gun was a plant.
Batista's innocent.

30:42.842 --> 30:45.208
I have to re-evaluate
my position.

30:45.302 --> 30:47.429
We need to do
the right thing here, I...

30:48.180 --> 30:49.716
Cados?
Hmm?

30:50.391 --> 30:51.380
What is it?

30:52.476 --> 30:55.513
There was a calling pattern
on Rebecca Barton's phone.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.390
Same number kept cropping up.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.104
Untraceable.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.806
Check out the dates.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.941
(CLEARS THROAT)
I took it back a year.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.692
This was when we were looking
for a mole in the department.

31:07.283 --> 31:10.116
And, more recently,
when Liber8 took Jim Martin.

31:10.411 --> 31:11.400
Yeah.

31:11.495 --> 31:13.451
Betty found his
location pretty quickly.

31:14.749 --> 31:15.955
I don't know what to do.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.473

You ran it last year.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.640
Said it was a dead end.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.734
I switched the SIM card
in your phone to make
sure it matched.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.150
Why were you in contact
with Rebecca Barton?

31:52.328 --> 31:53.864
Carlos, please.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.240
Some tech
genius you are.

31:56.832 --> 32:00.120
You used the same
secret SIM card
for a year.

32:00.211 --> 32:02.372
Listen, Liber8 wanted me
on the hook and I...

32:02.463 --> 32:04.169
Save it, Betty.

32:06.008 --> 32:08.670

to give me this one...

32:20.856 --> 32:22.471
Standard until
the case is closed.

32:24.193 --> 32:26.184
Do you have any idea
what's going on in there?

32:28.072 --> 32:30.688
Betty was caught in a big lie.

32:31.033 --> 32:32.443
A life-changer.

32:32.576 --> 32:36.194
Can you imagine that?
Lying to your brothers and
sisters in blue every day.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.495
I didn't ask for any of it.

32:40.376 --> 32:42.367
I'm gonna ask you
one question, okay?

32:45.214 --> 32:46.624
Are you going to
tell the truth?

32:51.011 --> 32:52.751
KlERA: Cantor admitted
he was confused.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.213
It was a tragic mistake.
He shot first,

32:55.391 --> 32:56.801
there was no gun
in the crowd.

32:58.936 --> 33:02.394
This is one of Cantor's
friends planting the evidence.

33:02.565 --> 33:04.556
They could have just
recovered the gun,

33:04.775 --> 33:07.517
but they wanted to corroborate
Cantor's version of events.

33:08.404 --> 33:11.646
Nora and internal
investigation are going
to be all over this.

33:11.949 --> 33:14.235
They're gonna say
I put people up to
cover for Cantor.

33:14.743 --> 33:16.119
Did you?

33:16.579 --> 33:17.739
Excuse me?

33:17.913 --> 33:22.247
Okay, we have been
asking the wrong questions.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.499
So concerned with
this Liber8 hotbed

33:24.587 --> 33:26.953
that we missed the traitor
in our own department?

33:27.047 --> 33:28.912
Are we gonna compound
that mistake now?

33:29.091 --> 33:31.798
Just tell Cantor to
come clean, make the
other statements go away.

33:32.094 --> 33:33.254
So throw him to the wolves.

33:33.470 --> 33:36.257
KlERA: I think he wants to
take responsibility for
what he did.

33:36.557 --> 33:39.344
And then we get to let
an innocent man go free.

33:39.685 --> 33:40.800
Okay.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.478
I want a statement
from the Professor,

33:44.690 --> 33:45.930
the pictures will
go to Nora,

33:46.108 --> 33:47.769
she'll be thrilled
to get scalps.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.442
Obviously none of
this means anything

33:50.654 --> 33:52.610
if Cantor doesn't admit fault.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.531
What about Betty?

34:18.224 --> 34:19.634
What's going on?

34:19.934 --> 34:22.471

use you as bait.

to contact you.

When you're here,
you work as normal.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.999

you're under house arrest.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.377
You know me, Carlos.

34:54.718 --> 34:57.004
You know I would never...
You did.

be only that one thing.

I’d like to hear what
Mr. Sad/er has to say.

35:23.664 --> 35:24.870
Uh...

35:25.916 --> 35:27.827
I've reviewed 96
active projects,

35:28.043 --> 35:30.420
52 in which are
military-focused.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.714
I suppose you think
that's too many.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.582
Too many that haven't
been exploited properly.

35:37.052 --> 35:41.091
Now, I propose that we
fast-track civilian versions
of 33 of these technologies

35:41.181 --> 35:44.548
and provide law enforcement
with advanced prototypes
for field testing and

35:44.893 --> 35:46.633
eventually for sale.

35:46.729 --> 35:49.812
Frontline policing
is the new military.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.602
The advance troops,
so to speak.

35:52.735 --> 35:54.566
And every police force
around the globe

35:54.653 --> 35:57.861
will need new solutions
for crime and civil unrest.

35:58.032 --> 36:01.320
Piron is ready to grow that
market with technology that
we already own.

36:01.702 --> 36:02.908
We increase our profits,

36:02.995 --> 36:04.531
positively affect
community values

36:04.621 --> 36:07.784
and free up capital
that we can use to make
people's lives better.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.995
Now, should we discuss
the affected projects?

36:15.257 --> 36:17.589
So we'll talk later.
Good job.

36:20.888 --> 36:22.799
Dillon will make
a powerful ally.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.929
First time I've seen
your father in you.

36:25.017 --> 36:26.177
Is that a good thing?

36:26.393 --> 36:27.382
Very.

36:27.561 --> 36:28.801
Listen.

36:28.896 --> 36:32.434
I need your help with
the insurance claim for
the anti-matter lab.

36:32.733 --> 36:36.817
They're denying payment
because of video evidence
of your experiment.

36:36.904 --> 36:38.360
My experiment?

36:57.841 --> 36:58.830
What's this?

36:58.967 --> 37:02.835
Oh, well, you see, you're
actually part of an argument
I'm having with myself.

37:03.806 --> 37:07.390
Cantor, Batista, Rebecca.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.220
I mean, you certainly
talk the talk, Detective,

37:09.311 --> 37:11.302
butlhavent
seen any walking.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.390
You're lecturing me.

37:14.483 --> 37:17.816
Some may see me as
misguided, revolutionary even,

37:17.903 --> 37:21.896
but nobody, nobody can
call me a hypocrite.

37:22.366 --> 37:23.731
So go ahead, you keep
doing what you're doing,

37:23.826 --> 37:25.566
but the next conversation
that we have

37:25.953 --> 37:27.784
is not gonna be
so friendly.

37:55.023 --> 37:56.524
I'm happy to see you here.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.566
You are doing the right thing.

37:59.653 --> 38:03.942
I was taught to believe
we all had a responsibility
to protect the system,

38:04.199 --> 38:06.861
but I'm starting to think
that's the wrong way
to look at it.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.865
Each of us has our own
responsibility to the truth.

38:12.583 --> 38:13.868
I changed my mind.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.117
I'm not gonna
say anything.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.999
They told me they'd
probably rule it
"inconclusive."

38:21.049 --> 38:22.129
I got a family.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.712
I'm sorry, Agent Cameron.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.393

You two can go and
join the others over there.

be here really soon, okay?

39:06.303 --> 39:07.668

39:09.932 --> 39:12.969

didn't make it.

39:13.101 --> 39:16.138
They're calculating sunk
costs for education
and projected output.

39:16.522 --> 39:18.228
It'll be added to

39:19.191 --> 39:21.557
Yes, sir.
Now, muster up!

39:25.405 --> 39:28.272
The suppression system
was deliberately compromised.

39:28.825 --> 39:30.690
This was a Liber8 job.

39:30.786 --> 39:34.495
Now they're worried about
heat damage to your CMRs, so
they're doing a diagnostic...

39:48.011 --> 39:49.262
How about you, Cameron?

39:50.389 --> 39:51.925
Ship-shape, sir.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.155
I disabled your tracking app.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.404
It's what I would
have done, too.

40:19.459 --> 40:23.168
Wow! This is very
Marty McFly right now.

Did you see a light?

40:32.514 --> 40:34.015
Did it hurt?

40:35.267 --> 40:36.973
Wait, hold on.

40:45.235 --> 40:46.611
Yeah.
Yeah.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.693
Okay, so what do you
want to talk about?

40:49.531 --> 40:51.237
Uh, you first.

40:51.325 --> 40:52.940
Fine. What do you want?

the right to know?

41:14.681 --> 41:16.922
Where's the device you used?
It's safe.

41:17.184 --> 41:18.549
It's safe from who,
from me?

41:20.020 --> 41:21.726
You're really not gonna
tell me anything.

41:23.482 --> 41:25.894
You know, ifthis was
Star Trek, we'd fight now.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.269
Except it isn't.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.690
How'd you get that?

41:31.073 --> 41:32.609
Uh...
BOTH: Shaving.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.948
You see?
You and me,

41:36.161 --> 41:37.617
we're the same.

41:37.704 --> 41:39.945
I promise you,
we're not.

41:40.874 --> 41:43.456
Emily is a liar, and a crook.

41:43.543 --> 41:46.159
I mean, you didn't travel
through time for that.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.245
You're not half as smart
as you think you are.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.622
Oh, that's real rich
coming from you.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.093
Real burn there, Alec.

41:52.177 --> 41:53.508
Don't push me, Alec.

41:53.804 --> 41:55.760
I've seen things
that you wouldn't...

41:56.848 --> 41:57.837
(SIGHS)

41:58.934 --> 42:01.391
So I guess we're not
gonna be pals then, huh?

42:02.771 --> 42:04.682
I don't see how.

42:05.941 --> 42:07.522
Have it your way.

42:20.455 --> 42:21.706
(SHOWER CURTAIN RATTLING)

42:30.882 --> 42:32.213
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

42:34.803 --> 42:36.134
You scared me.

42:36.221 --> 42:37.336
I know what you mean.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.555
Hey, that's my shirt.

42:41.309 --> 42:42.970
Do you mind?
Do I mind?

42:52.571 --> 42:53.651
Hi.
Hi.

43:05.584 --> 43:06.699
You.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.496
I choose you.
