WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:03.769
Right?

00:03.805 --> 00:06.305
<i>It's the choices that
get us where we're going.</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:08.707
Put your hands up! Don't move!

00:08.743 --> 00:10.876
<i>Me, I took a deal
to stay out of jail.</i>

00:10.912 --> 00:12.111
Falco? Yeah.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.279
Koz.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.458
How much you know
about the vagos?

00:14.482 --> 00:15.714
Not much.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.149
<i>Always looking
for the easy ride.</i>

00:17.185 --> 00:18.729
Well, what I need is
for you to gather evidence.

00:18.753 --> 00:21.754
<i>The cops called me
a confidential informant.</i>

00:21.789 --> 00:24.156
<i>The vago motorcycle club
I infiltrated.</i>

00:24.192 --> 00:26.559
<i>Called me a snitch.</i>

00:32.467 --> 00:34.166
<i>Who cares what they think?</i>

00:34.202 --> 00:36.635
<i>They're mostly in jail now.</i>

00:36.671 --> 00:38.137
<i>I left california
and I disappeared.</i>

00:38.172 --> 00:40.406
<i>Into witness protection.</i>

00:40.441 --> 00:43.809
<i>Charlie falco's dead.
Long live charlie conner.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.747
<i>No one ever mentioned
my new home in virginia.</i>

00:48.783 --> 00:50.816
<i>Just happens to be ground zero.</i>

00:50.852 --> 00:53.652
<i>For one of america's
biggest biker wars.</i>

01:38.499 --> 01:39.843
<i>Virginia's home
to more biker gangs.</i>

01:39.867 --> 01:41.534
<i>Than I can list,</i>

01:41.569 --> 01:44.703
<i>All of them fighting for
a slice of the territory.</i>

01:44.739 --> 01:47.740
<i>And presiding over this war
is one guy.</i>

01:47.775 --> 01:51.410
<i>Well, let's just say
his reputation precedes him.</i>

01:51.445 --> 01:53.812
You called this parley.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.748
So what d'you want?

01:55.783 --> 01:58.651
I thought we
had a truce going, devil.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.487
I mean, we stay out of
your territory,

02:01.522 --> 02:04.223
And you stay out of ours.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.758
That includes petersburg.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.228
I got friends in petersburg.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.430
You saying I have to ask
permission to visit?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.932
Come on.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.600
Just cut the bullshit.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.735
We seen your boys
muscle their way.

02:16.771 --> 02:19.738
Into our bars to move your dope.

02:19.774 --> 02:22.741
We see you there again,
you know how it's gonna end.

02:22.777 --> 02:25.578
I'll tell you how it ends.

02:25.613 --> 02:29.848
From now on,
I'm gonna lift my leg.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.952
And I'm gonna mark
any territory I want.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.988
And I ain't gonna let
no maggot stop me.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.458
Follow him!
Don't let him get away!

03:12.493 --> 03:13.626
Go!

04:43.117 --> 04:46.885
Devil? C'mon, man.

04:46.921 --> 04:49.154
Devil...

04:49.190 --> 04:53.492
You got no one
to blame but yourself.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.175
Devil!

05:10.211 --> 05:13.112
What kind of man are you?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.441
Bag him up.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.144
And mop this place down.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.215
<i>Sometimes I feel like
i've been to hell and back.</i>

05:50.251 --> 05:52.484
<i>But there are circles
of hell in america,</i>

05:52.520 --> 05:55.087
<i>Just waiting for
lost souls like me.</i>

06:43.871 --> 06:46.839
Conner?

06:46.874 --> 06:48.073
Charlie!

06:49.543 --> 06:52.044
Yeah?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.213
How much longer
on that fan-belt?

06:54.248 --> 06:56.548
I'm done, but the
engine's still vibrating.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.717
Don't worry about that.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.686
Can pick it up
in half an hour, mam.

07:00.721 --> 07:01.854
Thank you.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.033
Mike, if it's the engine mounts,

07:03.057 --> 07:04.523
That's a pretty big job.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.291
Charlie, pull it out of the bay.

07:06.327 --> 07:07.726
It's alright, she'll pick it up.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.127
Just saying
it doesn't make sense.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.829
What doesn't make sense
is the fact.

07:10.865 --> 07:13.532
That I'm still paying you
off the books.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.034
You know anything about that
social security number yet?

07:16.070 --> 07:17.536
Still waiting on it.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.849
Yeah, well,
I can't keep you going.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.539
Like this forever, charlie.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.013
<i>So this is the new me...</i>

07:28.048 --> 07:30.015
<i>Charlie conner.</i>

07:30.050 --> 07:33.051
<i>No passport,
no birth certificate,</i>

07:33.087 --> 07:35.721
<i>No driver's license.</i>

07:35.756 --> 07:37.990
<i>Trying to put
the past behind me,</i>

07:38.025 --> 07:40.926
<i>But always looking over
my shoulder.</i>

07:40.961 --> 07:43.896
<i>Witness protection is
supposed to be a new start.</i>

07:43.931 --> 07:46.042
<i>Turns out even the little things
like finding an apartment.</i>

07:46.066 --> 07:49.201
<i>Are tough when you got no id,
no bank account,</i>

07:49.236 --> 07:50.569
<i>No history.</i>

07:58.779 --> 08:00.779
<i>I gotta make this work.</i>

08:00.814 --> 08:04.016
<i>I need to make this work.</i>

08:04.051 --> 08:05.884
<i>What else am I gonna do?</i>

08:09.890 --> 08:11.356
<i>I fill my days with routine,</i>

08:11.392 --> 08:14.927
<i>But it's hardly a life.</i>

08:16.797 --> 08:17.807
<i>It used to take something big.</i>

08:17.831 --> 08:19.598
<i>To get under my skin.</i>

08:19.633 --> 08:22.768
<i>These days, it's the little
things that set me off.</i>

08:44.325 --> 08:46.792
<i>Where does this come from?</i>

08:46.827 --> 08:51.330
<i>Hating who I was?
Hating who I've become?</i>

08:53.300 --> 08:55.834
<i>Maybe I'd rather not know.</i>

08:59.540 --> 09:02.274
<i>Sometimes the pain feels good.</i>

09:07.014 --> 09:10.983
<i>I guess one day
i'll connect the dots.</i>

09:11.018 --> 09:14.152
<i>But part of me knows I might not
like what I'll find.</i>

09:22.162 --> 09:24.162
Well, look who's back.

09:24.198 --> 09:25.697
Hey, yeah, I'll have the large...

09:25.733 --> 09:29.034
Large greek
with chicken and fries?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.203
'Cause you, sir,
are a man of habit.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.438
Yeah, you know,
the president has a closet.

09:33.474 --> 09:35.273
Filled with the exact same suit,

09:35.309 --> 09:38.310
So that he has one less decision
to make on a busy day.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.711
Is that right?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.346
So this means you
and the president.

09:41.382 --> 09:44.116
Are both busy and decisive?

09:44.151 --> 09:45.984
Or predictable and boring?

09:46.020 --> 09:48.320
Well, I can't speak
for the president personally,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.122
But I myself am trying to quit.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.425
The whole unpredictable
and exciting thing.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.895
<i>Feels better to be out,</i>

09:56.930 --> 09:59.197
<i>Even though I can't be myself.</i>

09:59.233 --> 10:01.333
<i>But I'm not only loner
trying to get a toe hold.</i>

10:01.368 --> 10:02.467
<i>In this state.</i>

10:25.392 --> 10:28.060
What's up, dirtbag?

10:28.095 --> 10:30.896
I got a sit-down with crowbar.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.388
Bullet.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.456
Crowbar.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.760
You gonna leash that thing?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.106
Baby's just lettin'
you know that she don't.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.364
Care for your patch.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.101
Well, I can't say
I care for baby's attitude.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.471
We doin' this or what?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.108
Come on.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.375
Come on.

11:32.159 --> 11:35.460
I thought this was
a deal with you and stubby.

11:35.496 --> 11:37.829
But I only see you.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.331
Stubby's out bad.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.501
From now on, you deal
straight with me.

11:42.569 --> 11:48.340
So you're the
president of a chapter of one.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.476
Doesn't that scare you, bullet?

11:51.512 --> 11:53.311
A mongol from california,

11:53.347 --> 11:57.082
Riding all alone
in a pagan state?

11:57.117 --> 12:00.485
Well, I met a biker
from up near richmond.

12:00.521 --> 12:03.155
Calls himself the devil.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.892
He tells me virginia's
an outlaw state.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.195
Maybe I should take
my business to him.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.169
As promised...

12:17.204 --> 12:20.338
9 glock clone, untraceable.

12:20.374 --> 12:21.840
Takes standard mag
all the way up.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.509
To 100 round barrel.

12:36.390 --> 12:37.390
What's this for?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.557
Your bonus.

12:38.592 --> 12:42.527
Well, I like your style.

12:42.563 --> 12:45.363
If you can get me 20 more.

12:45.399 --> 12:47.232
20 more?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.167
As a first order.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.203
Well, well, well...

12:51.238 --> 12:52.649
Our mongol friend isn't
foolin' around,

12:52.673 --> 12:55.173
Is he, dirtbag?

12:55.209 --> 12:56.541
Why so many?

12:56.577 --> 12:57.876
That's my business.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.511
Well, if I'm gonna
sell you 20 pieces,

12:59.546 --> 13:01.513
It's my business.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.882
You starting an army
or something?

13:03.917 --> 13:05.884
I'm sending 'em west to my club.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.185
Boys can't get their own guns?

13:07.221 --> 13:08.587
It's way too hot.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.923
Atf, fbi; Every damn agency's
got their eyes on us.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.359
It's better to buy 'em here
and send 'em back.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.627
Hmph...

13:16.597 --> 13:17.662
And if this works out,

13:17.698 --> 13:19.431
Maybe we turn it into
a regular thing.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.066
How regular?

13:21.101 --> 13:22.501
Let's see how you do
the first time.

13:22.536 --> 13:24.569
You get the cash,
I'll make the deal.

13:24.605 --> 13:27.105
I'll get the cash,

13:27.140 --> 13:30.375
You take me to the guns,
and I make the deal.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.210
No, that kinda
cuts me out, don't it?

13:32.246 --> 13:34.379
You'll get your cut.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.947
But I make the deal.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.149
In or out?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.094
I'll call my guy.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.708
Hit the spot?

14:03.744 --> 14:06.077
I'd... I'd hate you to think

14:06.113 --> 14:07.946
I was fishing for better tips,

14:07.981 --> 14:10.649
But I know most
of my regulars by name.

14:10.684 --> 14:15.320
It's, um, charlie.
Charlie conner.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.454
Charlie...

14:16.490 --> 14:20.125
Well, I, of course, am...

14:20.160 --> 14:22.394
Sarah jane.

14:22.429 --> 14:25.330
It's nice to finally
put a name to a tag.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.965
Anything else I can get you?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.134
I, I wouldn't
know where to begin.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.103
You can start with this.

14:37.678 --> 14:39.277
Something wrong with your phone?

14:39.313 --> 14:40.478
Donny...

14:40.514 --> 14:41.579
You won't take my calls.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.092
Where else am I
supposed to talk to you?

14:43.116 --> 14:45.317
We've talked, we're done.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.485
Maybe I'm not done.

14:47.521 --> 14:49.688
Donny, can you please just go?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.456
I just said I'm not done here.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.659
She asked you to go.

14:54.695 --> 14:56.027
Who the hell are you?

14:56.063 --> 14:57.996
He's nobody, he's just customer.

14:58.031 --> 14:59.331
Donny...

14:59.366 --> 15:00.777
Buddy, you don't know
who you're talking...

15:00.801 --> 15:02.701
Whoa!

15:02.736 --> 15:05.170
Was that totally necessary?

15:05.205 --> 15:06.471
Hey, hey!

15:06.506 --> 15:07.539
Stop it! Stop it!

15:09.476 --> 15:11.176
I'm calling the cops!

15:11.211 --> 15:12.711
No, no! No cops!

15:18.685 --> 15:21.486
Get out! Get out!

15:22.389 --> 15:25.190
Next time
mind your own business.

15:27.461 --> 15:29.527
Yeah... Next time?

15:34.368 --> 15:36.468
What is the matter with you?

15:36.503 --> 15:39.037
I ask myself that every day.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.887
<i>Tick, tick, tick...</i>

15:48.923 --> 15:54.226
<i>Seconds turn into minutes,
minutes into days...</i>

15:54.261 --> 15:56.795
<i>Days into years.</i>

15:56.831 --> 15:58.697
<i>When there's nothing to aim for,</i>

15:58.733 --> 15:59.865
<i>Life's aimless.</i>

16:05.272 --> 16:07.172
<i>We can choose to do
what we want,</i>

16:07.208 --> 16:09.341
<i>But we pay our own tab.</i>

16:10.778 --> 16:11.877
Yeah?

16:11.912 --> 16:14.947
Charlie, it's sherri.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.719
You forget our appointment?

16:20.755 --> 16:22.755
Sorry.

16:31.098 --> 16:32.765
Have you been in another fight?

16:32.800 --> 16:35.033
I just slipped
on some grease at work.

16:35.069 --> 16:37.903
If you're having
problems, I need to know.

16:37.938 --> 16:39.416
The marshal service
can't protect you.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.906
I know, I signed a pledge.

16:40.941 --> 16:43.742
'Stay out of trouble.' got it.

16:43.778 --> 16:46.412
How's the job coming?

16:46.447 --> 16:47.924
Well, let's just say
charlie conner's.

16:47.948 --> 16:49.259
Not gonna be employed
much longer.

16:49.283 --> 16:50.749
Unless he gets a number...

16:50.785 --> 16:51.950
I know... To match the name.

16:51.986 --> 16:53.252
It always takes a while.

16:53.287 --> 16:54.753
A while?

16:55.890 --> 16:58.757
Hmph. It's been over a year.

16:58.793 --> 17:00.859
Look, I'll check in
on that number,

17:00.895 --> 17:03.028
But if you can't keep
yourself out of trouble.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.297
We can't do our job
and protect you.

17:44.505 --> 17:47.172
Can you not get
into a car like a normal person?

17:47.208 --> 17:50.142
What's your problem?

17:50.177 --> 17:51.410
That's it?

17:51.445 --> 17:53.312
Mexican clone.
No serials, untraceable.

17:53.347 --> 17:55.981
We're ready for a full order.

17:56.016 --> 17:57.182
How soon?

17:57.218 --> 17:58.917
As soon as you
can get me the cash.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.486
Well, I'll need a few days.

18:00.521 --> 18:02.488
Okay.

18:02.523 --> 18:04.957
I'll tell him three days.
That enough time?

18:04.992 --> 18:06.125
Alright.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.327
Hey, bullet? Your pagan buddy.

18:08.362 --> 18:10.028
What about him?

18:10.064 --> 18:12.097
He wouldn't
set you up, would he?

18:12.133 --> 18:15.000
Y'know, that gum's
not the answer.

18:15.035 --> 18:16.535
Excuse me?

18:16.570 --> 18:18.537
Nicotine gum.

18:18.572 --> 18:20.105
All it does is
reinforce the idea.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.007
That you're trying to quit.

18:22.042 --> 18:23.208
I am trying to quit.

18:23.244 --> 18:25.010
Nobody likes
a quitter, meredith.

18:25.045 --> 18:26.512
I don't see how
insulting me helps.

18:26.547 --> 18:27.513
See, what you gotta do.

18:27.548 --> 18:29.047
Is you gotta shift
your identity.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.949
Stop being a smoker
trying to quit,

18:30.985 --> 18:32.229
And tell yourself
you don't smoke.

18:32.253 --> 18:34.019
Over and over.

18:34.054 --> 18:35.320
'I don't smoke.'

18:35.356 --> 18:36.955
Did I ask for your advice?

18:36.991 --> 18:37.956
'I don't smoke.'

18:37.992 --> 18:39.236
I don't smoke.
Why don't I smoke?

18:39.260 --> 18:40.626
'Cause I'm a nonsmoker.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.227
Tell yourself 'til
you believe it,

18:42.263 --> 18:43.896
And that's who you'll be.

18:48.269 --> 18:49.269
Dick.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.374
<i>Drinking again...</i>

18:55.409 --> 18:58.310
<i>Not that it helps.</i>

19:00.915 --> 19:03.882
<i>I'm like a negative space.</i>

19:03.918 --> 19:06.218
<i>I'm only here because I'm not.</i>

19:29.210 --> 19:32.244
<i>I need to talk to someone.</i>

19:32.279 --> 19:34.079
<i>But there's only one person
who understands.</i>

19:34.114 --> 19:36.582
<i>What I'm going through.</i>

19:36.617 --> 19:40.085
Of course you're not there.

19:40.120 --> 19:44.056
Nobody is anywhere.

19:44.091 --> 19:46.425
Koz...

19:46.460 --> 19:48.393
You 'member when you said
there's no checkmate...

19:48.429 --> 19:50.362
There's no checkmate
in this game, only check.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.030
Only check?

19:52.066 --> 19:54.933
Well, I'm down to my king,

19:54.969 --> 19:58.937
And all I can do is move
one square at a time,

19:58.973 --> 20:01.206
And check.

20:06.347 --> 20:08.413
Move forward, check,
move backwards, check,

20:08.449 --> 20:10.082
Move sideways, check.

20:10.117 --> 20:12.384
Check, check, check,
check, check...

20:13.487 --> 20:20.092
Anyway, you understand, right?

20:20.127 --> 20:21.660
Call me.

20:41.348 --> 20:44.650
Charlie...
How many times is this?

20:44.685 --> 20:46.652
I know, mike, I'm sorry.

20:46.687 --> 20:48.487
We got a brake job waiting.

20:48.522 --> 20:51.456
You think you can handle it?

21:06.040 --> 21:07.205
Koz?

21:07.241 --> 21:09.274
Hey, sorry I missed
your call, charlie.

21:09.310 --> 21:11.510
You know how
I love to talk chess.

21:11.545 --> 21:12.644
What call?

21:12.680 --> 21:16.181
Yeah, that's the one.

21:16.216 --> 21:17.293
I don't think I'd
remember it either.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.051
If I was in your condition.

21:19.086 --> 21:20.485
Good time?

21:20.521 --> 21:22.654
You mean like right now,
or my life in general?

21:22.690 --> 21:25.290
It's like that?

21:25.326 --> 21:27.292
Listen, I'd love to
hold your hand and talk about.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.695
Your feelings but I haven't
got time right now.

21:29.730 --> 21:32.397
Whatever. Neither do i.

21:32.433 --> 21:33.732
Okay, let me get right to it.

21:33.767 --> 21:35.500
Listen, you know why
you're having.

21:35.536 --> 21:37.803
Such a hard time adjusting?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.538
You're still fighting yourself.

21:39.573 --> 21:40.717
The question is, how long
before you go back.

21:40.741 --> 21:42.040
To your old ways?

21:42.076 --> 21:44.042
Come on, man,
I'm not going back.

21:44.078 --> 21:45.388
Okay, well, I'm
just saying that I've seen.

21:45.412 --> 21:46.823
A lot of guys in your
position, charlie,

21:46.847 --> 21:48.380
And the stats aren't pretty.

21:48.415 --> 21:50.060
Yeah, look, if you're
done tearing me down,

21:50.084 --> 21:51.516
I got a brake job to get to.

21:51.552 --> 21:53.251
I'm not... I'm not
tearing you down, buddy.

21:53.287 --> 21:54.553
I'm trying to help you.

21:54.588 --> 21:56.221
Listen, I'm calling
to offer you a job.

21:56.256 --> 21:58.423
What job?

21:58.459 --> 22:00.559
As a paid ci. Part time.

22:00.594 --> 22:02.539
Buddy of mine in the agency
is running an operation.

22:02.563 --> 22:03.428
Out of petersburg.

22:03.464 --> 22:04.596
I told him about you,

22:04.631 --> 22:07.532
And he's willing to talk
if you are.

22:13.774 --> 22:16.742
There'd be a bike in it for ya.

22:16.777 --> 22:19.544
Is that a yes?

22:22.216 --> 22:24.616
No, man. I can't go backwards.

22:24.651 --> 22:27.285
Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

22:27.321 --> 22:29.121
You take care?

22:37.690 --> 22:40.625
<i>You'll get a free
$10 bonus card.</i>

22:49.302 --> 22:51.102
Hey.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.637
Hey, sarah jane.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.672
Cook's just left.
We close early on weekends.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.175
Actually,
that's not why I'm here.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.509
It's not fight-day either,

22:58.545 --> 23:01.179
If that's what you came for.

23:01.214 --> 23:02.613
I came to apologize.

23:02.649 --> 23:03.681
For what?

23:03.716 --> 23:05.450
For making things worse for you,

23:05.485 --> 23:07.118
If that's what I did.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.619
No worse. No better.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.188
It's nothing I can't handle.

23:10.223 --> 23:14.125
And for future reference,
I don't need rescuing.

23:16.162 --> 23:19.530
Got it.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.233
Still... I'm sorry.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.171
Well, I better let you go.

23:27.207 --> 23:29.674
Why, you in a hurry?

23:29.709 --> 23:32.443
Aren't you?

23:32.478 --> 23:36.247
I got time
for a smoke if you do.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.819
It's been a while
since I've done this.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.554
Must interfere
with your fight training.

23:45.525 --> 23:47.558
How long you gonna
make me wear that?

23:47.594 --> 23:49.527
How long you gonna deserve it?

23:50.763 --> 23:52.797
You don't worry
your boss will notice?

23:52.832 --> 23:55.499
I buy it off her.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.207
You're new in town, right?

24:03.243 --> 24:04.442
More or less.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.711
So where was
our charlie before here?

24:06.746 --> 24:08.412
La, mostly.

24:08.448 --> 24:11.182
What were you doing there?

24:11.217 --> 24:12.617
Little bit of this and that.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.585
Rode with a biker club
for a bit.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.555
Oooh. A bad boy.

24:17.590 --> 24:21.259
So what, you came here
from southern california?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.427
On purpose?

24:23.463 --> 24:25.763
What's so wrong with here?

24:25.798 --> 24:28.533
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just biased,

24:28.568 --> 24:31.302
Seeing as it's the home
of my biggest mistakes.

24:31.337 --> 24:35.106
You mean like,
um, what's his name?

24:35.141 --> 24:37.108
Donny?

24:37.143 --> 24:38.476
Doesn't really matter.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.545
I'm not planning on being here
much longer anyway.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.113
Yeah? Where you going?

24:42.148 --> 24:44.448
Savannah.
Going to art school there.

24:44.484 --> 24:47.151
Well, I applied, anyway.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.626
Somehow I knew
there was more to you.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.121
Than what, the hash-slinger

24:50.156 --> 24:52.390
I'm disguised as?

24:52.425 --> 24:56.160
Finally, I meet a man who
can see my true potential,

24:56.195 --> 24:57.762
Just as I'm planning on leaving.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.797
So how long 'til you go?

24:59.832 --> 25:03.501
Couple months, if all goes well.

25:03.536 --> 25:06.470
A lot can happen
in a couple months.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.172
Maybe.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.826
What are you doin' there?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.761
Nothin'.

25:39.539 --> 25:42.540
We're here to see paco.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.745
Hey, hey, paco! My brother!

25:49.315 --> 25:51.315
So this is bullet.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.321
Gonna show me the cash?

25:57.357 --> 25:59.890
Show me what I'm buying.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.193
A mongol from so cal.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.562
You're long way
from home, amigo.

26:04.597 --> 26:07.732
Well, I could say
the same for you, amigo.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.869
I got lots of friends out there.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.706
Sure friends. Mongol friends.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.974
Anyone I know?

26:17.010 --> 26:19.210
No one that knows who you are.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.512
Well, maybe you
just know the wrong people.

26:23.383 --> 26:27.351
Maybe you don't know
the right ones.

26:27.387 --> 26:28.597
Look, if you
wanna know about me,

26:28.621 --> 26:30.321
Talk to somebody who matters.

26:30.356 --> 26:31.722
I'll get miles on the phone.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.491
You know, miles torres.

26:33.526 --> 26:36.861
International president of
the mongols motorcycle club.

26:44.871 --> 26:48.839
Fellas...

26:48.875 --> 26:53.444
H-how did we get here?

26:53.479 --> 26:57.682
I'm not gonna shoot
you with my phone, paco.

26:58.651 --> 27:01.252
I'm calling miles for you.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.587
By the way, I texted
him your address on the way in,

27:03.623 --> 27:05.322
So he knows I'm here.

27:05.358 --> 27:08.959
Forget it.
Just show me the cash.

27:10.630 --> 27:15.399
Like I said,
show me what I came for.

27:32.652 --> 27:37.054
Yep, we are all good.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.959
Count it if you want.

27:41.994 --> 27:44.829
I know where to
find you if it's short.

27:47.533 --> 27:51.001
Somebody tell me
we're all good here?

27:51.037 --> 27:54.538
Yeah, we good.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.845
So we'll do this again sometime.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.283
Charlie.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.418
Hey, mike.

28:16.453 --> 28:17.764
I told you, I'm still
waiting on it.

28:17.788 --> 28:19.287
I know, you'll tell me.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.567
I just wanted to know
how you feel about.

28:20.591 --> 28:22.791
Doing some overtime.

28:22.826 --> 28:23.959
Sure.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.461
You know bikes, right?

28:26.496 --> 28:27.796
Yeah, I know a little.

28:27.831 --> 28:28.930
Came in at lunch.

28:28.966 --> 28:30.632
Customer wants it back
in a hurry.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.468
I said we'd get to it
soon as possible.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.636
What's wrong with it?

28:34.671 --> 28:36.872
Pshht. You tell me.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.479
Could be dirt
in the cylinders...

28:44.514 --> 28:49.584
Could be the fuel injectors
need replacing.

28:54.625 --> 28:56.524
Go ahead, mike, I got this.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.626
I'll close up.

28:57.661 --> 28:58.827
I'll see you later.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.897
Yes, sir, bright and surly.

29:04.801 --> 29:07.936
Alright, moment
of truth, charlie.

29:09.740 --> 29:13.642
<i>It's been 784 days
since I rode one of these.</i>

29:17.681 --> 29:20.348
<i>But you know what
they say about riding bikes.</i>

29:38.468 --> 29:43.405
<i>I might not be free,
but I can feel free,</i>

29:43.440 --> 29:45.874
<i>Even if only for a moment.</i>

29:51.748 --> 29:54.149
<i>Falco is no snitch...</i>

29:59.056 --> 30:02.057
<i>What's it gonna be like
for me in witness protection?</i>

30:02.092 --> 30:03.591
<i>You'll begin a new life,</i>

30:03.627 --> 30:07.395
<i>With a new identity
in a new location.</i>

30:12.102 --> 30:13.168
<i>Falco, he's got a gun!</i>

30:22.713 --> 30:24.779
<i>You're dead.</i>

30:32.055 --> 30:33.755
<i>Not everyone
finds it easy to let go.</i>

30:33.790 --> 30:36.124
<i>Of the past...</i>

31:01.818 --> 31:03.618
Brought your cut.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.960
Well, here's
to a lucrative future.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.229
Sure. Have a good one.

31:15.532 --> 31:17.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

31:17.634 --> 31:19.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:19.536 --> 31:22.837
Nobody said it was time to go.

31:22.873 --> 31:26.141
It's time to celebrate!

31:26.176 --> 31:27.709
Dirtbag, why don't you load up.

31:27.744 --> 31:31.012
Our new mongol friend
a bowl of smiley-smile?

31:34.117 --> 31:35.950
You see this here, tina?

31:35.986 --> 31:38.253
The shit is gonna put
the pagans on the map.

31:38.288 --> 31:41.656
In this state.

31:43.527 --> 31:46.161
Let me ask you
something, the outlaws...

31:46.196 --> 31:47.762
What about 'em?

31:47.798 --> 31:50.131
You're allies, right?

31:50.167 --> 31:53.535
We work together
against the maggots.

31:55.238 --> 31:58.173
I heard they killed
a maggot boss awhile back.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.008
Creatively.

32:00.043 --> 32:03.144
What did you hear, exactly?

32:03.180 --> 32:06.948
Outlaws' boss, the guy
who calls himself the devil,

32:06.983 --> 32:08.683
Well, he goes medieval
on this maggot.

32:08.718 --> 32:10.985
And has him pulled apart...

32:11.021 --> 32:13.922
Like an insect.

32:13.957 --> 32:21.029
True story?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.997
Sure.

32:23.033 --> 32:26.868
You could call it
a farewell to arms...

32:26.903 --> 32:28.269
And legs.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.310
So this devil, he's...

32:35.345 --> 32:37.879
He's your ally?

32:37.914 --> 32:42.550
Well, the devil and us,
we got an understanding.

32:42.586 --> 32:46.087
He respects our territory.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.728
What's it to you, anyway?

32:53.763 --> 32:54.996
If we're gonna be allies,

32:55.031 --> 32:57.665
I just want to know
which ones I can trust.

32:57.701 --> 33:00.702
I don't like you.

33:00.737 --> 33:02.337
I don't like him.

33:03.974 --> 33:05.907
Well, shit, dirtbag.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.276
No one asked you to.

33:10.280 --> 33:13.915
Nah, I'm good. I got business.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.083
If you want to be our ally,

33:15.118 --> 33:17.085
Your business is right here.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.154
That is a valid point.

33:20.190 --> 33:23.791
You really gonna turn down
pagan hospitality?

33:31.935 --> 33:34.936
<i>Being back on a bike feels good.</i>

33:34.971 --> 33:37.972
<i>It reminds me who I am.</i>

33:38.008 --> 33:39.774
<i>Maybe koz is right...</i>

33:39.809 --> 33:43.611
<i>Maybe I've been fighting myself.</i>

33:43.647 --> 33:46.214
<i>It's like trying
to escape gravity.</i>

33:46.249 --> 33:48.917
<i>The pull is too great.</i>

33:52.113 --> 33:54.880
I told you,
I don't smoke that shit.

33:54.915 --> 33:58.917
Is that what you
call our hospitality?

33:58.953 --> 34:02.087
Shit?

34:04.959 --> 34:07.292
You remember desert storm?

34:07.328 --> 34:11.230
Gulf war, '91?

34:11.264 --> 34:13.076
Well, one night those hajjis
launch a scud attack.

34:13.100 --> 34:14.266
Into saudi.

34:14.301 --> 34:16.268
One of 'em hits
the us army base.

34:16.303 --> 34:19.071
Kills 27 servicemen
and wounds over 100 more.

34:19.106 --> 34:20.773
Yeah. What's your point?

34:20.808 --> 34:22.206
I was there.

34:22.243 --> 34:24.321
Chemical fire from that
shitstorm raked out my lungs.

34:24.344 --> 34:25.889
I spent the next six months
in walter reed.

34:25.913 --> 34:27.346
Learning how to breathe again.

34:27.380 --> 34:32.618
So when I tell you, again,
that I don't smoke that shit,

34:32.652 --> 34:35.053
You gonna keep on insulting me?

34:35.089 --> 34:37.688
'Cause that'd be a mistake.

34:40.094 --> 34:43.395
Respect, brother.

34:43.431 --> 34:45.297
I did not know you served.

34:45.331 --> 34:47.331
Now you do.

34:53.340 --> 34:55.808
Yeah, yeah.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.911
Crush him up a line.
You can snort that.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.660
That's what I'm talkin' about!

35:14.695 --> 35:17.830
Dirtbag, crush him up another.

35:17.865 --> 35:21.266
Already told you,
I got business.

35:21.302 --> 35:23.368
The sooner I get to it,
sooner we can do this again.

35:23.404 --> 35:25.003
Yeah, when?

35:25.039 --> 35:27.206
I'll call you.

35:30.878 --> 35:32.411
Don't look at me like that,

35:32.446 --> 35:34.746
And load us up another bowl.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.727
You know where you are?

35:48.762 --> 35:50.929
Yeah, sure. Why?

35:50.965 --> 35:52.831
Watch out for the dog.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.818
Could I get
a tequila and a beer?

36:26.133 --> 36:27.277
Just because you don't like him.

36:27.301 --> 36:29.434
Doesn't mean
we can't do business.

36:29.470 --> 36:31.103
You should've seen him
with paco.

36:31.138 --> 36:33.038
His game is tight.

36:33.073 --> 36:34.406
He should be riding with us.

36:34.441 --> 36:35.908
He ain't like us.

36:35.943 --> 36:37.409
That's for damn sure.

36:37.444 --> 36:39.111
When's the last time
you walked in.

36:39.146 --> 36:43.115
And dropped a wad like this?

36:54.795 --> 36:56.028
Hey...

36:56.063 --> 36:58.130
Can I get that beef jerky?

37:10.978 --> 37:13.512
Never let it be said
that I don't share the wealth.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.919
I think our friend is back.

37:21.989 --> 37:24.122
What a cutie.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.960
You're so pretty.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.172
Hey, this your dog?

37:40.207 --> 37:42.808
Are you lost?

37:42.843 --> 37:43.942
Nope.

37:43.978 --> 37:45.477
Then what are you doing here?

37:45.512 --> 37:48.213
Just enjoying a beverage.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.918
Baby, get! Baby!

37:57.057 --> 38:00.292
So listen now, son...

38:00.327 --> 38:04.296
I think it might be best
that you just...

38:04.331 --> 38:07.132
Move on down the road.

38:09.136 --> 38:12.537
Soon as I'm done my beverage.

38:12.573 --> 38:14.206
Is this your beverage?

38:14.241 --> 38:15.374
Yeah.

38:29.556 --> 38:30.856
Looks like you're finished.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.891
Bartender, same again.

38:41.101 --> 38:44.302
Are you gonna make me
dare you to pick that up?

38:58.986 --> 39:03.355
Charlie, what is wrong with you?

39:11.140 --> 39:12.239
Here.

39:12.274 --> 39:14.274
Thanks.

39:18.414 --> 39:20.581
So how'd it happen this time?

39:22.451 --> 39:25.185
Another unruly customer.

39:25.221 --> 39:27.287
There some
kind of unruly customer.

39:27.323 --> 39:28.956
Epidemic out there?

39:28.991 --> 39:30.691
Or you just get off
on picking fights?

39:30.726 --> 39:33.026
Your stalker buddy donny,

39:33.062 --> 39:34.461
He had it coming.

39:34.496 --> 39:37.431
What about tonight's customer?

39:37.466 --> 39:39.600
Hard to explain.

39:39.635 --> 39:43.437
I'm sure I can grasp the basics.

39:43.472 --> 39:47.708
You ever felt so numb that...

39:47.743 --> 39:51.945
You just wanna feel...
I dunno... Something?

39:51.981 --> 39:53.447
I can't say fighting was ever.

39:53.482 --> 39:56.116
My go-to cure for that feeling.

39:56.151 --> 39:57.985
Where was this bar, exactly?

39:58.020 --> 40:01.121
Just west of here. Biker bar.

40:02.191 --> 40:03.457
Dumbass!

40:03.492 --> 40:05.459
You could have
got yourself killed.

40:05.494 --> 40:07.427
I had it under control.

40:18.741 --> 40:22.209
Until his friends
piled on top of me...

40:28.584 --> 40:33.353
So... Make sure
that I never see you again.

40:37.359 --> 40:40.160
Asshole.

40:43.365 --> 40:46.199
You enjoyed it, didn't you?

40:46.235 --> 40:47.779
I just wanted to
remember what it feels like.

40:47.803 --> 40:50.270
To be alive.

40:51.807 --> 40:56.443
And? Did it work?

40:56.478 --> 41:00.347
You feelin' alive there,
charlie?

41:00.382 --> 41:03.517
I'm feeling something.

41:03.552 --> 41:06.353
And instead of
going for medical attention.

41:06.388 --> 41:09.222
Like a sensible person,
you come here?

41:11.493 --> 41:15.696
There something you think I
can do for you, charlie?

41:15.731 --> 41:18.565
I just want to talk.

41:19.635 --> 41:22.402
Thanks for the ice.
And the coffee.

41:24.773 --> 41:28.308
No, don't worry,
it's on the house.

41:28.344 --> 41:30.410
What's that?

41:33.182 --> 41:35.515
Your prescription.

41:45.260 --> 41:47.294
See you around.

41:47.329 --> 41:50.197
I'm here 'til I'm not.

42:29.671 --> 42:33.273
<i>So... Who do I wanna be?</i>

42:38.747 --> 42:39.880
<i>In the end, it's all about.</i>

42:39.915 --> 42:42.783
<i>The choices we make, right?</i>

42:42.818 --> 42:46.119
<i>It's the choices that
make us who we are.</i>

42:47.322 --> 42:51.124
Yeah koz, is that
ci job still available?

42:51.160 --> 42:53.627
'Cause if it is...
