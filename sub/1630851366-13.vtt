00:02.230 --> 00:04.830
>> Probst: FROM DAY ONE, THE

00:04.900 --> 00:05.530
PACE HAS BEEN RELENTLESS.

00:05.600 --> 00:06.030
THEY'VE SURVIVED ON VERY LITTLE

00:06.100 --> 00:07.270
FOOD.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.070
THEY'VE HAD TO NAVIGATE THE MOST

00:08.140 --> 00:10.410
DANGEROUS TWIST WE'VE EVER PUT

00:10.470 --> 00:11.470
IN THE GAME.

00:11.540 --> 00:15.080
THEY'RE ON FUMES.

00:15.140 --> 00:15.780
BUT THIS IS "SURVIVOR," AND

00:15.840 --> 00:16.410
EVERY EPIC BATTLE NEEDS THAT ONE

00:16.480 --> 00:18.110
FINAL PUSH.

00:18.180 --> 00:19.280
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THEIRS.

00:19.350 --> 00:19.910
ONCE AGAIN, THEY'RE STARTING

00:19.980 --> 00:22.420
OVER-- NEW ISLAND, NO FOOD,

00:22.480 --> 00:23.450
NO SHELTER.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.290
THERE WILL BE TWO IMMUNITY

00:26.350 --> 00:27.460
CHALLENGES, TWO TRIBAL COUNCILS,

00:27.520 --> 00:28.390
ONE FIRE-MAKING SHOWDOWN.

00:28.460 --> 00:31.460
AND WE HAVE ONE LAST TWIST THAT

00:31.530 --> 00:34.400
THEY WILL<i> NEVER</i> SEE COMING.

00:34.460 --> 00:39.470
SUMMER OF 2000, 21 YEARS AGO,

00:39.530 --> 00:40.400
WE'RE GOING TO READ THE VOTES

00:40.470 --> 00:42.400
AND ANNOUNCE THE WINNER OF

00:42.470 --> 00:43.470
"SURVIVOR" RIGHT HERE ON

00:43.540 --> 00:46.410
LOCATION.

00:46.470 --> 00:47.440
THEN, WE'RE GOING TO DO A

00:47.510 --> 00:49.680
"SURVIVOR" AFTER-SHOW AND KEEP

00:49.740 --> 00:50.780
EVERYBODY THERE TO TALK ABOUT

DESHAWN, XANDER, ERIKA, RICARD

00:55.520 --> 00:58.350
AND HEATHER.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.450
THREE OF THEM WILL GET TO THE

00:59.520 --> 01:01.190
END AND HAVE A CHANCE TO PLEAD

01:01.260 --> 01:02.620
THEIR CASE ABOUT WHY THEY

01:02.690 --> 01:03.460
DESERVE THE TITLE OF "SOLE

01:03.530 --> 01:04.390
SURVIVOR" AND THE $1 MILLION

01:04.460 --> 01:07.260
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.430
THIS IS THE FINALE OF "SURVIVOR

01:09.500 --> 01:10.500
41."

01:25.710 --> 01:27.050

I CAN SEE MYSELF WINNING IF I

01:28.720 --> 01:29.580
CAN JUST CONQUER THIS LAST PART

01:29.650 --> 01:32.250
OF IT.

01:32.320 --> 01:32.850
>> THIS IS HERE RIGHT NOW.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.490
I JUST GOT TO FIGHT TO THE

01:35.560 --> 01:36.190
BITTER END.

01:36.260 --> 01:36.720

01:36.790 --> 01:39.890
AND PULLING MYSELF UP.

01:39.960 --> 01:40.630
AND, I WANT TO BE THE OLDEST

01:40.700 --> 01:43.260
FEMALE TO WIN "SURVIVOR."

01:43.330 --> 01:44.630

01:44.700 --> 01:46.270
THIS GAME.

01:46.330 --> 01:47.570
>> THE GAME'S GOING TO GET

01:47.640 --> 01:48.400
REALLY INTENSE.

01:48.470 --> 01:48.940
IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF

01:49.000 --> 01:50.640
SCRAMBLING.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.640
IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF BROKEN

01:52.710 --> 01:53.580
PROMISES.

02:22.700 --> 02:23.570
JEFF THROWS US ANOTHER

02:23.640 --> 02:25.540
CURVEBALL, AND IT'S STARTING

02:25.610 --> 02:27.680
OVER ON A NEW BEACH AND GETTING

02:27.740 --> 02:28.610
THE BARE MINIMUM SUPPLIES.

WE GOT TO START OVER, AND, OOH,

THEY'RE GOING TO BE CRUMBLING AS

02:47.630 --> 02:48.630
I RISE TO THE TOP.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.000
>> THERE ARE DIFFERENT BUGS ON

02:51.070 --> 02:51.630
THIS ISLAND THAN OUR OLD ISLAND.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.800
>> ABSOLUTELY.

02:52.870 --> 02:53.570
>> LISTEN, ERIKA, WE SHOULD

02:53.640 --> 02:54.870
TALK.

02:54.940 --> 02:55.800
>> I-- I...

02:55.870 --> 02:56.500
>> I'M SORRY.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.110
>> I'M NOT READY TO TALK TO YOU

02:57.170 --> 02:58.040
RIGHT NOW.

02:58.110 --> 02:59.040
>> NO?

02:59.110 --> 02:59.670

03:00.710 --> 03:02.880

03:02.940 --> 03:04.650
BOLD STATEMENT.

03:04.710 --> 03:05.450
AND I LOVE YOU, GIRL.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.010
IT WAS JUST HAIL MARY ON MY

03:06.080 --> 03:07.180
PART.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.420
I HAD TO DO WHAT I HAD TO DO.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.050
>> I MEAN, I'M SURPRISED I WAS

03:09.120 --> 03:11.590
THE TARGET OF THE HAIL MARY.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.620
>> I MEAN, TRIBAL WAS ANOTHER

03:12.690 --> 03:14.020
MESS, MAN, THANKS TO-- TO YOUR

03:14.090 --> 03:15.390
BOY.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.620
I HAD TO CAUSE SOME CHAOS

03:16.690 --> 03:17.560
TONIGHT, SO I DECIDED TO BLOW UP

03:17.630 --> 03:19.060
ERIKA'S SPOT, AND THAT'S EXACTLY

03:19.130 --> 03:19.990
WHAT HAPPENED.

03:20.060 --> 03:20.660
I'M SAYING IT IN FRONT OF

03:20.730 --> 03:21.830
EVERYBODY SO YOU KNOW IT'S THE

03:21.900 --> 03:23.200
TRUTH, BUT ERIKA WILL NOT BE

03:23.260 --> 03:23.870
TAKING YOU TO THE END, HEATHER.

03:23.930 --> 03:26.300
SHE TOLD ME AT THE WATER WELL.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.540
LIKE, "I CAN'T BRING HEATHER

03:27.600 --> 03:28.400
TO THE END OF THE GAME BECAUSE

03:28.470 --> 03:29.040
IF I DO, SHE MIGHT STEAL SOME OF

03:29.100 --> 03:29.670
MY VOTES."

03:29.740 --> 03:32.540
>> I'VE ALWAYS JUST COULDN'T

03:32.610 --> 03:33.210
UNDERSTAND WHY I COULDN'T 100%

03:33.270 --> 03:35.580
TRUST YOU, AND NOW I<i> KNOW.</i>

03:35.640 --> 03:37.950
>> HEATHER WAS A LITTLE BIT

03:38.010 --> 03:38.910
THROWN OFF BY THAT, AND ERIKA

03:38.980 --> 03:40.280
WAS PISSED.

03:40.350 --> 03:40.920
RIGHTFULLY SO.

03:40.980 --> 03:41.620
BUT, I MEAN, WHAT CAN I DO?

03:41.680 --> 03:43.120
YOU GUYS ARE ON THE TOP, I'M ON

03:43.180 --> 03:44.390
THE BOTTOM, AND I'M TRYING TO

03:44.450 --> 03:45.090
BRING YOU DOWN TO MY LEVEL.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.590
IT'S ROUGH ON THE BOTTOM, DUDE.

03:47.660 --> 03:48.620
IT'S A ROUGH ROAD.

03:48.690 --> 03:50.860
GIVE PEOPLE A SHOVE.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.630
AND THAT-- THAT WAS THE GOAL,

03:52.690 --> 03:53.560
WAS TO SHAKE THE TABLE A LITTLE

03:53.630 --> 03:54.730
BIT BECAUSE IT COULD MAYBE CAUSE

03:54.800 --> 03:55.700
A RIFT IN Y'ALL'S LITTLE

03:55.760 --> 03:56.630
FOURSOME ALLIANCE.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.230
AND I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE.

03:58.300 --> 03:59.370
>> I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT.

03:59.430 --> 04:00.030
>> YEAH, NOT ONE BIT.

04:00.100 --> 04:00.640
THAT'S WHY I'M, LIKE, I CAN'T

04:00.700 --> 04:02.700
EVEN TALK TO HIM.

04:02.770 --> 04:03.740
I KNEW HE SAYS IT'S NOT

04:03.810 --> 04:04.370
PERSONAL, BUT, LIKE, IT WAS.

04:04.440 --> 04:04.870
>> IT REALLY WAS.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.410
>> IT WAS PERSONAL.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.680
IT WAS SO STUPID.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.580
DANNY WENT HOME, WHICH WAS

04:10.650 --> 04:11.210
COMPLETELY MY DECISION, BUT I'M

04:11.280 --> 04:11.780
NEVER GOING TO TRUST DESHAWN

04:11.850 --> 04:12.610
AGAIN.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.320
UGH.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.750
IT JUST, LIKE, DRIVES ME CRAZY

04:15.820 --> 04:16.620
BECAUSE I DID SO MUCH WORK TO

04:16.680 --> 04:18.520
TRY TO PROTECT HIM TODAY, AND

04:18.590 --> 04:20.120
THEN HE JUST, LIKE, POOPED ALL

04:20.190 --> 04:20.760
OVER IT.

04:20.820 --> 04:21.360
>> YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINAL

04:21.420 --> 04:21.690
FOUR...

04:21.760 --> 04:23.160
>> MM-HMM.

04:23.220 --> 04:23.760
>> ...AND NOT HIM BECAUSE YOU

04:23.830 --> 04:24.360
MADE A GOOD MOVE.

04:24.430 --> 04:24.990
>> MM-HMM.

04:25.060 --> 04:26.090
>> BUT HE WANTS TO EMBARRASS

04:26.160 --> 04:27.660
YOU.

04:27.730 --> 04:28.630
>> AS LONG AS I'M STILL IN IT,

04:28.700 --> 04:30.330
I STILL GOT A SHOT.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.570
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS HOW, LIKE,

04:31.630 --> 04:32.630
YOU BOUNCE BACK.

04:32.700 --> 04:33.530
>> SO, LITERALLY, HE HAS TO GO.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.340
LIKE, HE...

04:34.400 --> 04:35.070
>> HE JUST, LIKE...

04:35.140 --> 04:35.740
>> LIKE, HE CAN'T BE HERE.

04:35.800 --> 04:36.640
>> IT JUST, LIKE, DOESN'T MAKE

04:36.700 --> 04:39.840
ANY SENSE TO ME WHEN I'M, LIKE,

04:39.910 --> 04:40.640
I'VE LITERALLY TRIED TO, LIKE,

04:40.710 --> 04:43.280
PROTECT HIM SO MANY TIMES.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.610
>> DESHAWN THINKS HE MADE SOME

04:44.680 --> 04:47.080
BIG MOVE, BUT ALL HE WAS DOING

04:47.150 --> 04:47.780
WAS MAKING IT MORE IMPOSSIBLE

04:47.850 --> 04:48.620
FOR ANYBODY TO WORK WITH HIM IF

04:48.680 --> 04:51.350
HE WAS THE ONE THAT STAYED.

04:51.420 --> 04:52.120
IT WAS<i> PERFECT!</i>

04:52.190 --> 04:53.550
>> I KNOW.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.220
IT'S...

04:54.290 --> 04:54.690
>> AND NOW, LOOK WHO'S ON THE

04:54.760 --> 04:55.360
BOTTOM?

04:55.420 --> 04:56.290
HIM.

04:56.360 --> 04:56.920
>> IT'S-- I KNOW.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.690
>> I REALLY WANT DESHAWN TO

04:58.760 --> 04:59.560
CONTINUE TO BE THE FOCUS SO,

04:59.630 --> 05:00.630
FIRST OF ALL, I'M<i> NOT,</i> AND

05:00.700 --> 05:04.600
IN FINAL FOUR AT ALL.

05:04.670 --> 05:19.550
>> ALL RIGHT!

05:19.610 --> 05:20.420
>> ALL RIGHT!

05:20.480 --> 05:20.980
>> WELCOME TO THE "SURVIVOR"

05:21.050 --> 05:23.180
FINAL FIVE SHOW...

05:23.250 --> 05:23.850
>> NO.

05:23.920 --> 05:24.620
>> ...WITH YOUR HOST, DESHAWN

05:24.690 --> 05:26.550
RADDEN.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.620
RICARD, HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE

05:28.690 --> 05:29.560
THE LAST STANDING MEMBER OF UA?

05:29.620 --> 05:31.160
>> UM, NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE SINCE

05:31.230 --> 05:32.430
I ALWAYS KNEW I WOULD BE.

05:32.490 --> 05:33.060
>> OOH!

05:33.130 --> 05:34.760
OKAY, SO, THIS GUY-- HE'S A

05:34.830 --> 05:35.360
BEAST, AND HE KNEW IT FROM THE

05:35.430 --> 05:35.830
BEGINNING.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.630
ALL RIGHT, RICARD.

05:37.700 --> 05:38.630
I MEAN, LISTEN, WE'VE WATCHED

05:38.700 --> 05:39.730
ALL SEASON LONG.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.640
WE THINK YOU'RE A GREAT PLAYER.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.570
I'VE BEEN AMPLIFYING RICARD

05:41.640 --> 05:43.240
AS THIS HUGE TARGET THE ENTIRE

05:43.300 --> 05:44.470
SEASON FOR A REASON-- FOR THIS

05:44.540 --> 05:45.170
VERY MOMENT, ACTUALLY.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.170
AND HE HAS PLAYED A REALLY GOOD

05:46.240 --> 05:47.310
GAME.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.010
AND MAYBE THESE PEOPLE ARE SMART

05:48.080 --> 05:48.710
ENOUGH TO HAVE SEEN RICARD AS A

05:48.780 --> 05:49.280
THREAT ANYWAY, SO I DIDN'T HAVE

05:49.340 --> 05:51.210
TO DO ALL OF THAT.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.610
WE WANT TO SEE YOU WINNING.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.580
WE'RE ROOTING FOR YOU.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.150
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S SOME OTHER

05:55.220 --> 05:56.350
PLAYERS IN THE GAME WHO PROBABLY

05:56.420 --> 05:56.980
<i>AREN'T</i> ROOTING FOR YOU.

05:57.050 --> 06:00.620
COMPETITIONS, AND SO, IF HE

06:00.690 --> 06:03.060
DOESN'T WIN THE NEXT IMMUNITY

06:03.120 --> 06:03.890
CHALLENGE, RICARD<i> HAS</i> TO GO.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.160
THIS GOES.

06:05.230 --> 06:05.730
ANY LAST WORDS FOR-- FOR THE

06:05.790 --> 06:07.960
SHOW?

06:08.030 --> 06:10.230
>> ALL RIGHT.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.570
WE LOVE YOU.

06:11.630 --> 06:12.500
GOOD LUCK, BUDDY.

06:12.570 --> 06:13.130
OH, THAT WAS DOPE.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.100
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

06:14.170 --> 06:17.840
>> FINE.

06:17.910 --> 06:18.770
>> SO, ON THE SCALE OF ONE TO

06:18.840 --> 06:21.810
TEN, HOW PISSED ARE YOU AT ME?

06:21.880 --> 06:28.650
>> THANKS TO DESHAWN, NOW

06:28.720 --> 06:29.820
HEATHER'S, LIKE, SO UPSET WITH

06:29.880 --> 06:30.720
ME.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.390
LIKE, DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO

06:31.450 --> 06:32.490
ME.

06:32.550 --> 06:33.820
BUT FOR ME, IT'S REASONABLE FOR

06:33.890 --> 06:35.060
EVERYBODY TO START THINKING

06:35.120 --> 06:36.760
ABOUT WHO THEY NEED TO SIT

06:36.820 --> 06:37.830
BESIDE AT THE END.

06:37.890 --> 06:39.760
SO, I'M SURPRISED THAT SHE'S SO,

06:39.830 --> 06:41.100
LIKE, PERSONALLY HURT BY IT.

06:41.160 --> 06:41.830
AND IT SUCKS THAT, LIKE, SHE

06:41.900 --> 06:42.760
DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO HAVE A

>> AND THAT WAS NOT MY INTENT.

06:53.010 --> 06:53.840
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU FEEL

06:53.910 --> 06:54.740
THAT WAY.

06:54.810 --> 06:55.340
MY THOUGHT PROCESS IS, I'M ON

TH BOTTOM.

06:56.580 --> 06:57.650

USED, WHATEVER YOU WANT, I'M--

07:06.820 --> 07:08.560
I'M HERE.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.560
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT ANY OF IT,

07:09.620 --> 07:10.060
I UNDERSTAND THAT, TOO.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.230
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

07:11.290 --> 07:12.760
LIKE, I GET IT.

07:12.830 --> 07:13.730
>> DESHAWN SUNK HIS GAME.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.430
I KNOW THAT HE'S ON THE BOTTOM.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.830
HE'S TRYING TO GRASP AT STRAWS,

07:16.900 --> 07:17.830
BUT HE'S JUST THROWING GRENADES

07:17.900 --> 07:18.770
AND SEEING WHAT YOU CAN BREAK

07:18.830 --> 07:20.000
UP, AND JUST, LIKE, BLOWING MY

07:20.070 --> 07:20.970
GAME.

07:21.040 --> 07:21.770
THE CRAZY THING IS, I WAS ALSO

07:21.840 --> 07:23.700
HOPING TO, LIKE, KEEP HIM

07:23.770 --> 07:24.770
AROUND.

07:24.840 --> 07:25.840
NOW, LIKE, I DON'T SEE HOW WE'RE

07:25.910 --> 07:28.710
SUPPOSED TO, LIKE, MOVE FORWARD

07:28.780 --> 07:29.480
HERE.

07:29.540 --> 07:30.080
>> OH, THIS LOOKS INTERESTING!

07:30.140 --> 07:30.780
OH!

07:30.850 --> 07:31.350
OH!

07:31.410 --> 07:32.650
OH.

07:32.710 --> 07:33.780
WHAT?!

07:33.850 --> 07:36.780
>> OH, I'M DOWN.

07:36.850 --> 07:40.990
>> GUYS, WE HAVE TREE MAIL.

07:41.060 --> 07:41.820
IT'S CRAZY, BUT THERE-- THERE'S

07:41.890 --> 07:42.760
ONE FOR EVERY PERSON.

07:42.820 --> 07:43.460
>> MORE CHAOS.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.130
>> XANDER.

07:44.190 --> 07:45.830
>> CHAOS IN AN ENVELOPE.

07:45.890 --> 07:47.960
>> HEATHER.

07:48.030 --> 07:48.730
>> RIGHT.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.530
>> OH!

07:49.600 --> 07:49.900
LET'S GO FOR IT.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.170
ALL RIGHT!

07:52.230 --> 07:53.600
>> WOW.

07:53.670 --> 07:54.240
THE CLUE SAYS, "SOLVE THE PHRASE

07:54.300 --> 07:57.710
TO FIND THE ADVANTAGE.

07:57.770 --> 07:58.410
FIRST, YOU MUST UNSCRAMBLE THE

07:58.470 --> 08:00.780
WORDS, THEN DECIPHER THE PHRASE.

08:00.840 --> 08:01.840
YOU CANNOT SEARCH FOR THE

08:01.910 --> 08:04.250
ADVANTAGE UNTIL YOU HAVE

08:04.310 --> 08:05.810
CORRECTLY SOLVED THE ENTIRE

08:05.880 --> 08:06.780
PHRASE."

08:06.850 --> 08:08.420
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH BECAUSE

08:08.480 --> 08:09.420
WE DON'T KNOW THIS PLACE.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.120
I LITERALLY DON'T EVEN KNOW

08:10.180 --> 08:12.790
WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO PEE HERE.

08:12.850 --> 08:13.820
>> EVERYBODY'S HARD AT WORK,

08:13.890 --> 08:18.760
FIGURING OUT HOW TO DESCRAMBLE

08:18.830 --> 08:20.460
THESE WORDS, BECAUSE WHOEVER

08:20.530 --> 08:21.830
GETS THIS ADVANTAGE LIKELY HAS A

08:21.900 --> 08:23.300
SHOT OF WINNING $1 MILLION.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.500
>> IN MY HEAD, I HAD STARTED

08:24.570 --> 08:25.070
UNSCRAMBLING THE WORDS WHILE

08:25.130 --> 08:25.830
READING IT.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.100
I JUST LOVE PUZZLES!

08:28.170 --> 08:29.670
LOOK, I HAVE WON FOUR INDIVIDUAL

08:29.740 --> 08:30.270
CHALLENGES.

08:30.340 --> 08:33.270
I LOVE THIS KIND OF STUFF

08:33.340 --> 08:33.880
BECAUSE I'M GREAT AT PUZZLES.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.780
>> GOT IT.

08:36.840 --> 08:41.180
>> THE FINAL PHRASE IS:

08:41.250 --> 08:44.450
I'M THINKING, THEY DANCE BY THE

08:44.520 --> 08:45.790
OCEAN, THEY DANCE IN THE WIND.

08:45.850 --> 08:46.550
IT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR EGG HUNT

08:46.620 --> 08:47.520
RIGHT NOW.

08:47.590 --> 08:48.220
>> ALL OF A SUDDEN, XANDER GETS

08:48.290 --> 08:48.790
IT, RICARD GETS IT, DESHAWN GETS

08:48.860 --> 08:49.820
IT.

08:49.890 --> 08:51.130
LIKE, IN AN INSTANT, I'M IN LAST

08:51.190 --> 08:52.630
PLACE.

08:52.690 --> 08:56.660
YEAH.

08:56.730 --> 08:57.900
>> TRULY ALL THAT'S GOING

08:57.970 --> 08:58.570
THROUGH MY MIND IS, DON'T LET

08:58.630 --> 08:59.470
DESHAWN GET IT.

08:59.530 --> 09:00.170
THAT IS ALL I CARE ABOUT BECAUSE

09:00.230 --> 09:00.740
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ADVANTAGE

09:00.800 --> 09:01.440
IS.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.470
ITCOULD BE AN IDOL, IT COULD BE

09:02.540 --> 09:03.640
A TWIST AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

09:03.700 --> 09:04.670
I FEEL LIKE WE ALL KNEW WE

09:04.740 --> 09:07.070
NEEDED TO BEAT DESHAWN.

09:07.140 --> 09:07.740
>> THE GOAL HERE IS JUST TO MAKE

09:07.810 --> 09:08.710
SURE THAT RICARD DOESN'T FIND

09:08.780 --> 09:10.480
THIS ADVANTAGE.

09:10.540 --> 09:11.580
DANCING TREES, DANCING TREES.

09:11.650 --> 09:16.650
>> OF COURSE I'M THE LAST ONE TO

09:16.720 --> 09:17.620
GET THE PHRASE.

"YOUR TREASURE HANGS WHERE THE

09:20.720 --> 09:22.490
TREES LOVED TO DANCE."

09:22.560 --> 09:23.590
WHERE ARE THEY DANCING?

09:23.660 --> 09:24.660
OH, MY GOSH!

09:24.730 --> 09:26.160
I HATE DOING SCAVENGER HUNTS!

09:26.230 --> 09:27.190
>> I LOVE THIS.

09:27.260 --> 09:28.660
IT'S A LOT LIKE A CROSS COUNTRY

09:28.730 --> 09:29.630
OR TRACK RACE.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.870
EVERYBODY'S FEELING PAIN OUT

09:31.930 --> 09:32.670
THERE, BUT, WHEN YOU LOOK OVER

09:32.730 --> 09:34.940
AND YOU SEE THE GRIMACE OF YOUR

09:35.000 --> 09:35.640
OPPONENT, IT FUELS YOU.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.670
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUSH A

09:36.740 --> 09:40.640
LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THAT.

13:28.770 --> 13:32.570
MIGHT HELP YOU GET TO THREE.

13:32.640 --> 13:32.970
SURVIVORS, READY.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.610
GO!

13:35.680 --> 13:40.010
FIRST PHASE OF THIS CHALLENGE

13:40.080 --> 13:40.650
IS, YOU'VE GOT TO COLLECT ALL

13:40.710 --> 13:47.420
OF YOUR ROPE RUNGS.

13:47.490 --> 13:50.360
ERIKA HAS A BIG HEAD START

13:50.420 --> 13:52.460
BECAUSE FOUR OF HER ROPE RUNGS

13:52.530 --> 13:52.990
ARE ALREADY OFF.

13:53.060 --> 13:56.360
THEY'RE ON THE LADDER.

13:56.430 --> 13:56.960
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GOT TO GET

13:57.030 --> 13:58.800
ALL SEVEN.

13:58.870 --> 13:59.630
SO, IT'S ERIKA OUT IN THE EARLY

13:59.700 --> 14:03.500
LEAD.

14:03.570 --> 14:04.470
ERIKA HAS HER THREE.

14:04.540 --> 14:05.040
SHE'S OFF TO BUILD HER FIRST

14:05.110 --> 14:08.680
LADDER.

14:08.740 --> 14:12.650
RICARD WHACKING AT 'EM.

14:12.710 --> 14:14.780
DESHAWN DOING A NICE JOB.

14:14.850 --> 14:15.950
THERE GOES XANDER.

14:16.020 --> 14:16.650
IT IS HEATHER IN LAST, A

14:16.720 --> 14:17.620
FAMILIAR SPOT.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.650
BUT WHAT IS ALSO FAMILIAR IS,

14:20.720 --> 14:23.620
HEATHER<i> NEVER</i> STOPS TRYING.

14:23.690 --> 14:27.600
HAVING HER FIRST FOUR ROPE RUNGS

14:27.660 --> 14:28.660
ALREADY UP THERE.

14:28.730 --> 14:29.630
BUT HERE COMES RICARD.

14:29.700 --> 14:33.500
NOW XANDER.

14:33.570 --> 14:35.640
HEATHER'S GOT ALL SEVEN DOWN.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.670
NOW, SHE'S GOT TO COLLECT THEM.

14:36.740 --> 14:40.670
DESHAWN WORKING ON HIS LAST TWO.

14:40.740 --> 14:41.640
ONCE YOU BUILD THAT, ERIKA, GET

14:41.710 --> 14:44.580
ON UP AND START WORKING ON YOUR

14:44.650 --> 14:45.250
<i>SECOND</i> LADDER.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.850
RUNG, XANDER WITH ANOTHER ROPE

14:47.920 --> 14:51.190
RUNG, AND ANOTHER ADVANTAGE FOR

14:51.250 --> 14:52.250
ERIKA.

14:52.320 --> 14:52.920
THE FIRST FOUR RUNGS OF HER

14:52.990 --> 14:53.650
SECOND LADDER ARE ALSO ALREADY

14:53.720 --> 14:56.160
COMPLETED.

14:56.220 --> 14:56.720
HERE COMES DESHAWN, AND HERE

14:56.790 --> 14:59.630
COMES HEATHER.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.600
WE GOT A CHALLENGE!

15:02.660 --> 15:04.670
IT IS ERIKA ALL ALONE UP HERE

15:04.730 --> 15:08.240
ON THE SECOND STAGE.

15:08.300 --> 15:08.770
XANDER HAS GOT TO GO BACK.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.640
HE IS ONE RUNG SHORT.

15:11.710 --> 15:12.670
HE LEFT ONE HANGING, A

15:12.740 --> 15:16.580
POTENTIALLY FATAL MISTAKE ON DAY

15:16.640 --> 15:17.280
24 AND FINAL FIVE.

15:17.340 --> 15:19.180
NOW XANDER'S GOT TO REALLY WORK

15:19.250 --> 15:20.650
TO GET BACK IN THIS.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.550
HERE COMES RICARD.

15:22.620 --> 15:23.650
HE HAS WON THREE INDIVIDUAL

15:23.720 --> 15:25.690

15:28.720 --> 15:29.660
SHE WILL GET TO THE PUZZLE

15:29.720 --> 15:31.630
FIRST.

15:31.690 --> 15:32.660
QUESTION IS, WILL HER ADVANTAGE

15:32.730 --> 15:34.260
BE ENOUGH?

15:34.330 --> 15:34.930
IT'S ERIKA UP TOP.

15:35.000 --> 15:35.630
SHE CAN START WORKING ON THAT

15:35.700 --> 15:36.660
PUZZLE.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.700
XANDER MADE QUICK WORK OF THAT

16:40.530 --> 16:41.030
SHE EARNED AN ADVANTAGE THIS

16:41.100 --> 16:43.100
MORNING.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.160
SHE PUT THAT ADVANTAGE TO QUICK

27:11.460 --> 27:13.390
BY PLAYING IT FOR RICARD, KEEP

27:13.460 --> 27:14.460
RICARD BECAUSE HE'S SOMEONE

27:14.530 --> 27:15.400
THAT'S LOYAL TO ME.

27:15.460 --> 27:17.060
IF ANYTHING, THAT WOULD MAKE IT

27:17.130 --> 27:18.530
LOOK LIKE I'M THE ONE

27:18.600 --> 27:19.200
CONTROLLING THE VOTE.

27:19.270 --> 27:19.730
>> YOU WOULD PUT ANOTHER THING

27:19.800 --> 27:20.470
ON YOUR RESUME.

27:20.530 --> 27:22.540
(<i> CHUCKLES</i> )

27:22.600 --> 27:23.840
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO

27:23.900 --> 27:25.770
KNOW IS THAT, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

27:25.840 --> 27:26.370
I'M STILL UNDECIDED RIGHT NOW.

27:26.440 --> 27:27.370
>> OF COURSE.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.040
>> RIGHT, LIKE, I JUST GOT TO

27:28.110 --> 27:29.040
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST FOR MY

27:29.110 --> 27:30.040
GAME.

27:30.110 --> 27:31.410
AND, GOING INTO TONIGHT'S

27:31.480 --> 27:34.050
TRIBAL, IF I WANT TO SAVE HIM, I

27:34.110 --> 27:34.750
CAN.

27:34.810 --> 27:35.380
AND I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A BIG

27:35.450 --> 27:38.420
STATEMENT.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.490
>> AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT

27:39.550 --> 27:42.420
CHANGING YOUR MIND ON ME.

27:42.490 --> 27:43.390
>> BUT DO I WANT TO MAKE THAT

27:43.460 --> 27:44.460
$1,000,000 GAMBLE THAT I WOULD

27:44.520 --> 27:47.390
BEAT HIM IN A FINAL TRIBAL?

27:47.460 --> 27:50.460
IT'S HARD TO SAY.

27:50.530 --> 27:51.400
THIS IS MY SHOWCASE TO THE JURY.

27:51.460 --> 27:54.130
THIS IS WHEN I FINALLY SEND MY

27:54.200 --> 27:55.400
MESSAGE THAT I'M THE ONE WHO'S

27:55.470 --> 27:56.800
TAKING THE REINS IN THIS GAME.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.940
>> Probst: ALL RIGHT.

28:29.000 --> 28:29.570
SO, DESHAWN, LAST TRIBAL

28:29.640 --> 28:31.140
COUNCIL, YOU SAID, "NEED TO

28:31.200 --> 28:32.470
TAKE OUT RICARD.

28:32.540 --> 28:33.410
KEEPS WINNING."

28:33.470 --> 28:34.970
TODAY, ERIKA WINS, AND RICARD'S

28:35.040 --> 28:35.780
VULNERABLE.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.180
SO, WERE YOU AT CAMP, GOING, "WE

28:37.240 --> 28:39.380
GOT TO TAKE OUT RICARD BECAUSE

28:39.450 --> 28:42.580
HE'S GOING TO KEEP WINNING"?

28:42.650 --> 28:43.280
>> I MEAN, SO THAT WAS THE

28:43.350 --> 28:45.750
PREMISE OF LAST TRIBAL COUNCIL,

28:45.820 --> 28:46.420
TO KIND OF PLANT THAT SEED.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.960
SO, I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY A LOT

28:49.020 --> 28:50.760
OF THAT.

28:50.820 --> 28:51.420
I THINK EVERYBODY HERE WAS KIND

28:51.490 --> 28:53.790
OF ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT,

28:53.860 --> 28:54.930
AND BECAUSE THE SEED WAS ALREADY

28:54.990 --> 28:55.600
PLANTED.

28:55.660 --> 28:56.960
>> Probst: XANDER, THAT FEELS

28:57.030 --> 28:58.060
LIKE IT'S DONE, ACCORDING TO

28:58.130 --> 28:59.000
DESHAWN.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.630
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

29:00.700 --> 29:01.940
I CAN ATTEST TO THE FACT THAT

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
I WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF

29:03.070 --> 29:04.070
DESHAWN AND RICARD, AND IT

29:04.140 --> 29:05.640
FELT A LOT LIKE HIGH NOON IN THE

29:05.710 --> 29:06.810
WILD WEST.

29:06.870 --> 29:07.410
AND, YOU KNOW, DRAW!

29:07.470 --> 29:09.380
I WAS LIKE THE TUMBLEWEED

29:09.440 --> 29:10.080
BOUNCING AWKWARDLY IN THE

29:10.140 --> 29:11.480
MIDDLE.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.810
AND THEY BOTH KNOW THEY'RE ON

29:13.880 --> 29:14.480
THE CHOPPING BLOCK FOR DIFFERENT

29:14.550 --> 29:15.080
REASONS, SO THEY WERE GUNNING

29:15.150 --> 29:16.080
FOR EACH OTHER.

29:16.150 --> 29:18.220
>> Probst: SO, HEATHER, XANDER

29:18.280 --> 29:19.020
DESCRIBES IT AS HIGH NOON.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.350
THE WILD, WILD WEST.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.120
WERE YOU OPEN TO HEARING BOTH

29:21.190 --> 29:21.750
THEIR STORIES?

29:21.820 --> 29:22.320
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY.

29:22.390 --> 29:23.020
I'M OPEN TO LISTENING TO

29:23.090 --> 29:24.620
EVERYTHING.

29:24.690 --> 29:25.890
I MEAN, THE MORE INFORMATION YOU

29:25.960 --> 29:26.790
HAVE, THE MORE CHOICES.

29:26.860 --> 29:27.490
YEAH.

29:27.560 --> 29:28.190
>> Probst: HOW ABOUT YOU, ERIKA?

29:28.260 --> 29:30.860
>> YEAH, WE'RE AT THAT POINT IN

29:30.930 --> 29:31.530
THE GAME NOW WHERE IT'S, LIKE,

29:31.600 --> 29:33.700
THINGS THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE

29:33.770 --> 29:34.370
A COMPLIMENT IN REAL LIFE--

29:34.430 --> 29:35.170
LIKE, OH, SOMEONE IS A TRUSTED

29:35.240 --> 29:39.010
ALLY-- COULD BE, LIKE, A BAD

29:39.070 --> 29:40.070
THING ON "SURVIVOR."

29:40.140 --> 29:41.440
AND THINGS THAT COULD BE A BAD

29:41.510 --> 29:43.010
THING IN REAL LIFE-- LIKE

29:43.080 --> 29:44.440
SOMEBODY CANNOT BE TRUSTED--

29:44.510 --> 29:45.280
COULD BE A GOOD THING ON

29:45.350 --> 29:46.080
"SURVIVOR."

29:46.150 --> 29:47.010
IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHAT'S GOOD

29:47.080 --> 29:50.520
AND BAD GET FLIPPED AROUND,

29:50.580 --> 29:51.220
AND ANY DECISION IS A TOUGH ONE.

29:51.280 --> 29:54.150
>> Probst: SO, RICARD, YOU HAVE

29:54.220 --> 29:55.020
BEEN THE TOPIC QUITE A FEW TIMES

29:55.090 --> 29:57.060
ABOUT "HE'S GOING TO WIN IF HE

29:57.120 --> 29:58.090
GETS TO THE END," AND HERE YOU

29:58.160 --> 29:59.030
ARE NOW, VULNERABLE.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.830
ALL IT TAKES IS THREE OF THESE

30:00.890 --> 30:02.060
PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR YOU, AND IT'S

30:02.130 --> 30:03.030
OVER.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.060
>> WELL, I THINK I'VE PLAYED A

30:04.130 --> 30:07.030
REALLY GOOD GAME.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.230
IT'S HARD, YOU KNOW?

30:08.300 --> 30:09.640
WE GET BACK TO CAMP LAST NIGHT,

30:09.700 --> 30:10.340
THEY ARE RATTLED.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.810
SHE'S ALMOST IN TEARS FROM WHAT

30:13.870 --> 30:15.010
HE SAID AT TRIBAL.

30:15.070 --> 30:19.010
IT'S REALLY HARD.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.080
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE, TO DO SO

30:22.150 --> 30:22.980
WELL IN THE GAME, IT'S JUST...

30:23.050 --> 30:24.350
I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING, AND NOBODY

30:24.420 --> 30:25.390
EVEN KNOWS IT.

30:25.450 --> 30:27.020
AND IT'S JUST-- IT'S-- IT'S

30:27.090 --> 30:28.090
REALLY HARD.

30:28.150 --> 30:29.320
>> Probst: YOU'VE BEEN

30:29.390 --> 30:30.120
STRUGGLING WITH THINGS IN THE

30:30.190 --> 30:31.020
GAME THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

30:31.090 --> 30:34.990
ABOUT?

30:35.060 --> 30:39.000
>> LAST YEAR, MY HUSBAND AND I,

30:39.070 --> 30:40.070
WE HAD-- GOT PREGNANT AGAIN,

30:40.130 --> 30:42.000
AND I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS

30:42.070 --> 30:43.000
GOING TO BE OKAY AND EVERYTHING

30:43.070 --> 30:44.300
WAS GOING TO BE FINE.

30:44.370 --> 30:45.440
AND "SURVIVOR" KEPT GETTING

30:45.510 --> 30:46.070
PUSHED BACK, AND COVID AND

30:46.140 --> 30:48.270
EVERYTHING.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.180
AND THEN, I FINALLY GET THE

30:50.240 --> 30:51.010
CALL, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

30:51.080 --> 30:54.980
DO BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE, MY DREAM

30:55.050 --> 30:58.080
TO BE HERE, BUT MY BABY IS DUE

30:58.150 --> 30:58.990
NEXT WEEK.

30:59.050 --> 30:59.650
LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL

30:59.720 --> 31:00.450
ANYONE BECAUSE WHAT WOULD THEY

31:00.520 --> 31:01.550
THINK OF ME?

31:01.620 --> 31:02.620
LIKE, "OH, YOU'RE LEAVING."

31:02.690 --> 31:03.320
LIKE, MY BABY, LITERALLY, COULD

31:03.390 --> 31:06.330
ALREADY BE BORN RIGHT NOW, AND I

31:06.390 --> 31:07.060
DON'T KNOW.

31:07.130 --> 31:10.060
I'VE BEEN REALLY STRUGGLING.

31:10.130 --> 31:14.530
AND I'M STILL SO PROUD OF MYSELF

31:14.600 --> 31:15.300
THAT I MADE IT THIS FAR, AND I

31:15.370 --> 31:19.010
DID A<i> REALLY</i> DAMN GOOD JOB.

31:19.070 --> 31:22.080
FOR YOU?

31:22.140 --> 31:23.010
BECAUSE YOU ARE SIMILAR TO

31:23.080 --> 31:25.910
RICARD IN THAT YOU'RE VERY

31:25.980 --> 31:27.010
HONEST AND OPEN WITH YOUR

31:27.080 --> 31:28.080
EMOTIONS, AND YOU WILL SAY WHEN

31:28.150 --> 31:30.480
YOU'RE HURTING OR WHEN YOU'RE

31:30.550 --> 31:31.180
FRUSTRATED.

31:31.250 --> 31:32.190
AND RICARD IS HAVING THAT MOMENT

31:32.250 --> 31:33.150
RIGHT NOW.

31:33.220 --> 31:34.090
HE'S BEING VERY OPEN.

31:34.150 --> 31:35.020
"I DON'T LIKE THIS, IT HURTS MY

31:35.090 --> 31:36.460
HEART."

31:36.520 --> 31:37.520
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I DEFINITELY

31:37.590 --> 31:39.030
UNDERSTAND RICARD.

31:39.090 --> 31:40.090
I THINK RICARD AND I HAVE HAD A

31:40.160 --> 31:43.030
VERY TUMULTUOUS "FRENEMY-SHIP,"

31:43.100 --> 31:45.370
I GUESS YOU'D CALL IT, OUT HERE.

31:45.430 --> 31:46.100
AND HE SEES MY HEART, I THINK,

31:46.170 --> 31:46.970
WHEN WE TALK.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.300
AND I SEE HIS.

31:48.370 --> 31:49.000
I KNOW HE'S A GOOD DUDE.

31:49.070 --> 31:50.440
I CAN HEAR THE HURT IN HIS

31:50.500 --> 31:51.040
VOICE, AND I FEEL BAD.

31:51.100 --> 31:51.900
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

31:51.970 --> 31:52.540
THAT'S MY FRIEND, AND I WISH HIM

31:52.610 --> 31:54.610
THE BEST OF LUCK.

31:54.670 --> 31:55.280
>> Probst: XANDER, IF A GROUP OF

31:55.340 --> 31:56.880
PEOPLE HAVE ENOUGH NUMBERS AND

31:56.940 --> 31:57.980
THEY WANT TO GET RID OF YOU, YOU

31:58.040 --> 31:58.610
CAN'T STOP THEM UNLESS YOU HAVE

31:58.680 --> 32:00.610
AN IDOL OR THE NECKLACE.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.120
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT IN

32:02.180 --> 32:03.020
TERMS OF, "BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT

32:03.080 --> 32:04.080
GOES-- WE HAVE THE NUMBERS, YOU

32:04.150 --> 32:06.720
ARE GOING HOME, AND YOU CAN'T

32:06.790 --> 32:07.420
STOP IT"?

32:07.490 --> 32:10.090
>> YEAH, I MEAN, RICARD'S FOUGHT

32:10.160 --> 32:11.020
SO HARD THIS ENTIRE GAME, AND

32:11.090 --> 32:14.630
HE'S JUST BEEN PEGGED AS THIS

32:14.690 --> 32:15.330
GUY WHO'S IN CHARGE AND, YOU

32:15.400 --> 32:18.530
KNOW, CHOOSING WHO'S GOING HOME.

32:18.600 --> 32:19.230
BUT RICARD AND I TALK BECAUSE

32:19.300 --> 32:20.400
WE'VE GROWN SO CLOSE OVER THESE

32:20.470 --> 32:21.300
DAYS.

32:21.370 --> 32:22.100
>> BROMANCE!

32:22.170 --> 32:23.000
>> IT, YEAH-- TH-- THERE'S A BIT

32:23.070 --> 32:24.270
OF A BROMANCE.

32:24.340 --> 32:24.900
IT'S KIND OF GREAT.

32:24.970 --> 32:26.510
I LOVE IT!

32:26.570 --> 32:27.210
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

32:27.270 --> 32:31.010
REALLY HARD TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE

32:31.080 --> 32:33.450
HAVE JUST PUT HIM IN THIS

32:33.510 --> 32:34.080
POSITION WHERE HE'S GOT HIS BACK

32:34.150 --> 32:35.010
AGAINST THE WALL AND THERE'S

32:35.080 --> 32:38.950
NOTHING THAT HE CAN DO.

32:39.020 --> 32:39.820
AND I FEEL FOR HIM.

32:39.890 --> 32:40.450
>> CAN I JUST SAY ONE LITTLE

32:40.520 --> 32:43.020
THING WHICH IS FUNNY TO ME?

32:43.090 --> 32:44.460
EVERYONE'S SAYING, "RICARD RUNS

32:44.520 --> 32:45.590
THE SHOW."

32:45.660 --> 32:46.190
IF I<i> WAS</i> RUNNING THE SHOW,

32:46.260 --> 32:48.730
WOULD BE IN FINAL FOUR.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.430
I THINK DESHAWN'S GOING TO GET

32:49.500 --> 32:51.000
MORE VOTES THAN ANY OF THE THREE

32:51.060 --> 32:52.100
OF THEM.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.000
>> NOW, ERIKA, IT'S RICARD WHO'S

32:55.070 --> 32:56.440
GOT THE GUNS OUT, SAYING, "I GOT

32:56.500 --> 32:58.100
NOTHING TO LOSE."

32:58.170 --> 32:59.010
THE TRUTH BOMBS.

32:59.070 --> 33:00.710
>> LIKE, I-- I DON'T BLAME HIM

33:00.770 --> 33:01.870
FOR HAVING THE GUNS OUT, BUT

33:01.940 --> 33:03.010
BECAUSE PERCEPTION IS SO

33:03.080 --> 33:05.650
IMPORTANT AND BECAUSE OF THE

33:05.710 --> 33:07.050
PERCEPTION THAT PEOPLE HAVE

33:07.110 --> 33:08.510
WHEN IT COMES TO RICARD,

33:08.580 --> 33:10.080
UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE, THAT'S A--

33:10.150 --> 33:14.020
A BIG CONSIDERATION OF THE GAME.

33:14.090 --> 33:15.020
>> Probst: SO, RICARD, WHY DON'T

33:15.090 --> 33:16.090
<i>YOU</i> WRITE THE LAST PARAGRAPH?

33:16.160 --> 33:19.160
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU CAME

33:19.230 --> 33:21.460
OUT HERE WITH A LOT OF EMOTION

33:21.530 --> 33:22.130
THAT YOU HAD TO KEEP BOTTLED UP,

33:22.200 --> 33:25.300
AND THAT YOU'VE LEARNED THINGS

33:25.370 --> 33:26.470
ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOU'RE GOING

33:26.530 --> 33:27.130
TO GO HOME TO BE A DIFFERENT

33:27.200 --> 33:28.100
PERSON THAN WHEN YOU CAME OUT

33:28.170 --> 33:31.000
HERE.

33:31.070 --> 33:34.110
>> YEAH.

33:34.170 --> 33:35.010
I JUST DIDN'T THINK I WOULD DO

33:35.070 --> 33:35.940
SO WELL.

33:36.010 --> 33:39.010
I DID NOT THINK THAT I WAS

33:39.080 --> 33:39.850
CAPABLE.

33:39.910 --> 33:40.480
AND I'M ACTUALLY, LIKE, REALLY,

33:40.550 --> 33:41.850
KICK-ASS AT "SURVIVOR."

33:41.910 --> 33:42.650
(<i> CHUCKLES</i> )

33:42.720 --> 33:44.350
>> YES.

33:44.420 --> 33:45.550
YEAH.

33:45.620 --> 33:46.150
>> Probst: AND, RICARD, I CAN

33:46.220 --> 33:47.020
SEE THE PRIDE YOU HAVE IN

33:47.090 --> 33:48.890
<i>YOURSELF.</i>

33:48.960 --> 33:51.260
AND IT'S COOL TO WITNESS BECAUSE

33:51.320 --> 33:54.660
EVEN YOU ARE FINDING MOMENTS OF

33:54.730 --> 33:55.330
VULNERABILITY WHERE YOU WANT TO

33:55.400 --> 33:56.860
SHARE A LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHO

33:56.930 --> 33:57.860
YOU ARE.

33:57.930 --> 33:58.460
THAT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU'VE

33:58.530 --> 34:00.530

43:24.430 --> 43:25.000

43:48.150 --> 43:52.930

43:52.990 --> 43:54.090
IN ADDITION, YOU HAVE POWER.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.160
YOU WILL DECIDE WHICH PERSON

43:56.230 --> 43:57.000
SITS NEXT TO YOU IN THAT SECOND

43:57.060 --> 44:00.000
SPOT AND WHO YOU FORCE TO MAKE

44:00.070 --> 44:00.600

44:00.670 --> 44:03.100

44:03.170 --> 44:05.000
BIG POWER, BIG DECISIONS.

44:05.070 --> 44:06.110
FIRST, YOU GOT TO WIN.

44:06.170 --> 44:07.410

44:09.040 --> 44:12.040
>> OKAY.

44:12.110 --> 44:19.590
>> Probst: HERE WE GO.

44:19.650 --> 44:20.990
FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE OF THE

44:21.050 --> 44:23.460
SEASON GUARANTEES YOU A SPOT IN

44:23.520 --> 44:24.090
THE FINAL THREE, THE PLACE YOU

44:24.160 --> 44:28.990
WANT TO BE.

44:29.060 --> 44:30.100
SURVIVORS, READY.

44:30.160 --> 44:33.000
GO.

44:33.070 --> 44:35.970
OUT OF THE GATE, YOU CAN MOVE

44:36.040 --> 44:36.540
QUICKLY, PUTTING THAT FIRST

44:36.600 --> 44:37.170
BLOCK.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.700
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SPELLING

44:38.770 --> 44:39.470
"FINAL 3" FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE

44:39.540 --> 44:40.640
TOP.

44:40.710 --> 44:41.270
THE LONGER THIS CHALLENGE GOES,

44:41.340 --> 44:42.110
THE PACE WILL SLOW DOWN

44:42.170 --> 44:46.550
<i>DRAMATICALLY.</i>

44:46.610 --> 44:48.980
AN IDEA OF HOW THIS WORKS.

44:49.050 --> 44:52.320
XANDER DROPS, TOO.

44:52.380 --> 44:53.020
THAT'S PART OF IT.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.820
YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT

44:55.890 --> 44:57.020
BALANCE OF TENSION ON THE ROPE

44:57.090 --> 45:00.030
VERSUS HOW FAST YOUR FEET ARE

45:00.090 --> 45:00.990
MOVING BECAUSE YOU WANT BOTH.

45:01.060 --> 45:03.430
YOU WANT TO MOVE QUICKLY, BUT

45:03.500 --> 45:04.760
YOU WANT TO MOVE WITH SOME

45:04.830 --> 45:05.400
CERTAINTY THAT YOU ARE KEEPING A

45:05.460 --> 45:08.330
BALANCE POINT.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.000
WITH EVERY BLOCK YOU ADD,

45:09.070 --> 45:10.800
OBVIOUSLY, IT GETS MUCH MORE

45:10.870 --> 45:12.100
DIFFICULT BECAUSE THAT STACK

45:12.170 --> 45:16.640
STARTS TO GROW, AND THAT BALANCE

45:16.710 --> 45:17.280
BECOMES<i> REALLY</i> IMPORTANT.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.980
SO, YOU COULD MAKE A LOT OF

45:21.050 --> 45:24.050
PROGRESS AND HAVE ONE LITTLE

45:24.120 --> 45:24.980
SLIPUP, AND YOU'RE<i> BACK</i>

45:25.050 --> 45:28.990
SO, A BIG DECISION IN THIS

45:29.050 --> 45:32.890
CHALLENGE IS, WHAT DO YOU FAVOR?

45:32.960 --> 45:33.590
PACE, WHERE YOU'RE MOVING

45:33.660 --> 45:37.000
A LITTLE FASTER, LITTLE RISKIER?

45:37.060 --> 45:39.430
OR DO YOU SLOW IT DOWN AND HOPE

45:39.500 --> 45:40.730
SOMEBODY ELSE DROPS AND YOU TRY

45:40.800 --> 45:41.430
TO GET THROUGH THIS ENTIRE

45:41.500 --> 45:45.000
CHALLENGE WITHOUT EVER DROPPING?

45:45.070 --> 45:47.770
HEATHER LOSES EVERYTHING.

45:47.840 --> 45:48.440
SHE'S GOT TO START OVER.

45:48.510 --> 45:49.140
THAT MEANS YOU GOT TO TAKE ALL

45:49.210 --> 45:52.740
THE BLOCKS BACK, GRAB THE FIRST

45:52.810 --> 45:53.380
ONE, HEAD BACK OUT.

45:53.450 --> 45:54.110
HERE COMES DESHAWN WITH HIS

45:54.180 --> 45:56.820
THIRD BLOCK.

45:56.880 --> 45:57.480
DESHAWN IS IN IT.

45:57.550 --> 46:00.120
HERE COMES XANDER HEADING BACK

46:00.190 --> 46:02.520
WITH HIS FOURTH LETTER, THE "N."

46:02.590 --> 46:04.720
ERIKA READY TO REACH FOR THAT

46:04.790 --> 46:05.420
FOURTH BLOCK.

46:05.490 --> 46:06.130
SHE'S GOT TO KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT

46:06.190 --> 46:08.990
SHE'S BUILT SO FAR.

46:09.060 --> 46:12.130
YOU GOT TO BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO

46:12.200 --> 46:16.800
REACH IT WITHOUT TIPPING IT.

46:16.870 --> 46:17.270
XANDER PLACES THE "N."

46:17.340 --> 46:20.440
HE HAS FOUR.

46:20.510 --> 46:21.140
XANDER'S NOW IN THE LEAD.

46:21.210 --> 46:23.340
HERE COMES ERIKA WITH HER FOURTH

46:23.410 --> 46:24.110
LETTER.

46:24.180 --> 46:24.980
IT IS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS ENTIRE

46:25.040 --> 46:28.980
CHALLENGE AND NEVER DROP, BUT IT

46:29.050 --> 46:32.990
REQUIRES PRECISION.

46:33.050 --> 46:36.120
YOU CANNOT MAKE A MISTAKE.

46:36.190 --> 46:36.990
DESHAWN DROPS.

46:37.060 --> 46:39.020
HE'S GOT TO START AGAIN.

46:39.090 --> 46:40.390
THERE COMES XANDER WITH HIS

46:40.460 --> 46:41.060
FIFTH BLOCK.

46:41.130 --> 46:42.130
ERIKA'S STILL HEADING BACK FOR

46:42.190 --> 46:45.000
HER FIFTH BLOCK, SO XANDER IS

46:45.060 --> 46:47.500
INCREASING HIS LEAD RIGHT NOW.

46:47.570 --> 46:48.130
XANDER NOW HEADING BACK FOR HIS

46:48.200 --> 46:50.440
SIXTH AND FINAL BLOCK.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.540
THIS IS WHERE IT GETS VERY

46:52.600 --> 46:53.110
DANGEROUS.

46:53.170 --> 47:03.050
HE'S GOT A LOT OF TIME.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.980
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO PANIC,

47:05.050 --> 47:06.120
KNOWING HE HAS A ONE-BLOCK LEAD.

47:06.190 --> 47:08.150
AND ERIKA DROPS, AND THAT OPENS

47:08.220 --> 47:08.990
THE DOOR FOR XANDER TO CONTROL

47:09.050 --> 47:12.120
THE ENTIRE PACE OF THIS

47:12.190 --> 47:12.990
CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.

47:13.060 --> 47:16.560
A<i> HUGE</i> MISTAKE BY ERIKA.

47:16.630 --> 47:19.600
AND NOW HEATHER DROPS.

47:19.670 --> 47:20.800
<i>SHE'S</i> GOT TO START AGAIN.

47:20.870 --> 47:23.000
IS DESHAWN, WITH ONLY TWO

47:23.070 --> 47:24.140
LETTERS.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.000
THIS IS XANDER'S CHALLENGE TO

47:25.070 --> 47:30.110
WIN, BUT HE'S GOT TO WIN IT.

47:30.180 --> 47:38.280
XANDER NOW HEADING BACK OUT WITH

47:38.350 --> 47:39.350
HIS SIXTH AND FINAL BLOCK.

47:39.420 --> 47:40.650
YOU CAN SEE HEATHER'S PACE

47:40.720 --> 47:41.350
MOVING FASTER NOW.

47:41.420 --> 47:43.360
ERIKA TRYING TO GET BACK IN IT.

47:43.420 --> 47:44.260
EVERYBODY IS HOPING THAT XANDER

47:44.320 --> 47:44.990
DROPS BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR ONLY

47:45.060 --> 47:53.000
SHOT.

47:53.070 --> 47:54.130
XANDER PLACES THE LAST LETTER.

47:54.200 --> 47:56.700
HE HAS SPELLED "FINAL 3."

47:56.770 --> 47:57.340
NOW, HE JUST HAS TO GET BACK TO

47:57.400 --> 47:59.970
THE FINISH.

48:00.040 --> 48:00.540
ERIKA, MOVING QUICKLY NOW,

48:00.610 --> 48:02.540
PLACES HER THIRD BLOCK.

48:02.610 --> 48:04.240
DESHAWN COMING BACK WITH HIS

48:04.310 --> 48:04.980
FOURTH BLOCK.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.140
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THIS

48:06.210 --> 48:07.310
CHALLENGE.

48:07.380 --> 48:08.980
YOU GOT TO KEEP FIGHTING AS IF

48:09.050 --> 48:12.120
YOU<i> GOT</i> A SHOT.

48:12.180 --> 48:17.420
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH WITH SIX

48:17.490 --> 48:26.370
BLOCKS TO LOSE IT ALL.

48:26.430 --> 48:28.600
THIS COULD BE A MILLION-DOLLAR

48:28.670 --> 48:29.000
CHALLENGE.

48:29.070 --> 48:30.140
>> OH, MY GOD.

48:30.200 --> 48:31.370
>> Probst: HEATHER DROPS.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.970
GOT TO START OVER.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.670
IT'S ERIKA WITH FOUR, DESHAWN

48:35.740 --> 48:36.340
WITH FOUR, XANDER WITH ALL SIX,

48:36.410 --> 48:40.980
AND HE IS ABOUT TWO FEET AWAY

48:41.050 --> 48:42.110
FROM EARNING A SPOT IN THE FINAL

48:42.180 --> 48:44.220
THREE.

48:44.280 --> 48:44.980
GOT TO HAVE BOTH FEET BEHIND

48:45.050 --> 48:48.120
THAT TAPE.

48:48.190 --> 48:51.960
CAN HE GET THOSE LAST FEW STEPS?

48:52.020 --> 48:52.590
HEATHER PLACES HER SECOND BLOCK.

48:52.660 --> 48:53.130
ERIKA HEADING BACK FOR HER

FIFTH.

48:54.190 --> 48:57.000
DESHAWN HEADING BACK FOR HIS

48:57.060 --> 48:58.360
FIFTH.

48:58.430 --> 48:59.530

48:59.600 --> 49:00.130
HE'S GOT ONE FOOT HALFWAY OVER

49:00.200 --> 49:02.930
THE LINE.

49:03.000 --> 49:04.540
VERY CLOSE.

49:04.600 --> 49:05.240
THE FIRST FOOT IS OVER.

49:05.300 --> 49:06.140
JUST GOT TO GET THAT SECOND FOOT

49:06.200 --> 49:08.970
OVER.

49:09.040 --> 49:12.110
HALF AN INCH BACK.

49:12.180 --> 49:24.320
XANDER DOES IT!

WOW!

49:49.010 --> 49:57.020

GAME, AND I JUST GOT TO TAKE

50:06.230 --> 50:08.270
THAT FIRST BREATH OF AIR, YOU

50:09.070 --> 50:12.140
IT'S-- IT'S, LIKE, BREATHING.

AROUND ME AT FINAL FOUR, AND--

50:21.580 --> 50:22.550
AND THAT'S JUST, LIKE, THE

50:22.610 --> 50:23.420
CRAZIEST SENTENCE I'VE EVER

50:24.220 --> 50:24.980
LIKE, WAY CRAZIER THAN THE

50:51.540 --> 50:52.980
WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO BE ON

50:53.040 --> 50:54.150
'SURVIVOR' ONE DAY."

50:54.210 --> 50:56.850
HE WAS THE KID WHO WAS LIKE, "I

COULD NEVER BE ON 'SURVIVOR.'"

50:57.580 --> 51:00.150

51:33.050 --> 51:34.250
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.820
>> YOU DID GOOD.

51:35.890 --> 51:36.520
>> THANKS.

51:36.590 --> 51:39.190
>> I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR XANDER,

51:39.260 --> 51:40.490
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, IT IS A

51:40.560 --> 51:41.190
BIT OF A HEARTBREAKER FOR ME

51:41.260 --> 51:43.400
BECAUSE I REALLY, REALLY WANTED

51:43.460 --> 51:45.000
TO WIN THIS ONE SO I COULD

51:45.060 --> 51:47.800
CONTROL MY FATE.

51:47.870 --> 51:48.430
BUT XANDER WON, AND I'M NERVOUS

51:48.500 --> 51:49.000
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN A BIT OF A

51:49.070 --> 51:51.840
WILD CARD.

51:51.900 --> 51:53.000
SO, I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW THIS

51:53.070 --> 51:54.410
ONE'S GOING TO GO.

52:05.250 --> 52:11.320
(<i> BIRDS SQUAWKING</i> )

52:11.390 --> 52:13.630
>> THANKS, GUYS.

52:13.690 --> 52:14.560
>> IT'S MAJOR, BRO.

52:14.630 --> 52:15.190
>> GOOD JOB.

52:15.260 --> 52:19.130
YOU GOT THE WISH, XANDER.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.030
>> FINAL IMMUNITY CHALLENGE.

52:20.100 --> 52:21.200
I PULLED IT OFF.

52:21.270 --> 52:23.070
FROM A GAME STANDPOINT, THIS

52:23.130 --> 52:24.040
MEANS THAT I'VE GOTTEN TO THE

52:24.100 --> 52:25.500
FINAL THREE AND THAT I'VE GOT MY

52:25.570 --> 52:26.810
CHANCE AT THE MILLION.

52:26.870 --> 52:27.440
BUT ON A MUCH MORE PERSONAL

52:27.510 --> 52:32.010
LEVEL, HAVING THIS NECKLACE

52:32.080 --> 52:33.210
AROUND ME IS BIGGER THAN THAT.

52:33.280 --> 52:39.220
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED ANYTHING ABOUT

52:39.280 --> 52:43.360
PUSHING MYSELF IN COMPETITION

52:43.420 --> 52:44.020
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I

52:44.090 --> 52:46.790
WAS INSECURE.

52:46.860 --> 52:48.030
I WAS CHUBBY.

52:48.090 --> 52:50.000
I WAS NOT PROUD OF WHO I WAS,

52:50.060 --> 52:51.200
BUT I WANTED TO CHANGE.

52:51.260 --> 52:52.030
I WANTED TO BE THE VERSION OF

52:52.100 --> 52:56.030
MYSELF THAT I DREAMED OF.

52:56.100 --> 52:57.200
SO, IN NINTH GRADE, I DECIDED

52:57.270 --> 53:00.040
THAT I WOULD GO OUT FOR THE

53:00.110 --> 53:01.470
CROSS COUNTRY TEAM.

53:01.540 --> 53:02.740
AT FIRST, EVERYBODY SAW ME AS

53:02.810 --> 53:03.310
THE CHUBBY KID WHO WANTED TO

53:03.380 --> 53:06.140
LOSE WEIGHT ON THE TEAM.

53:06.210 --> 53:07.610
BUT AFTER THREE RACES, I HAD

53:07.680 --> 53:08.280
DROPPED TWO MINUTES AND KNOCKED

53:08.350 --> 53:11.620
SOMEONE OFF THE TOP 50 BOARD.

53:11.680 --> 53:12.250
I WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE

53:12.320 --> 53:15.220
NATIONALS, AND WE BECAME THE

53:15.290 --> 53:16.020
BEST TEAM IN FLORIDA HISTORY.

53:16.090 --> 53:17.990
AND I LEARNED THAT THROUGH

53:18.060 --> 53:20.030
HARD WORK AND DISCIPLINE,

53:20.090 --> 53:21.190
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN'T DO.

53:21.260 --> 53:24.030
SO, TO HAVE THIS NECKLACE AROUND

53:24.100 --> 53:25.960
ME MEANS THAT I GOT THERE, THAT

53:26.030 --> 53:27.200
I'M THAT MAN THAT I DREAMED I

53:27.270 --> 53:29.430
COULD BE.

53:29.500 --> 53:30.370
WE MADE THE WHOLE SEASON IN,

53:30.440 --> 53:31.640
LIKE, THE HARDEST SEASON OF ALL

53:31.700 --> 53:32.040
TIME.

53:32.100 --> 53:33.200
>> I KNOW.

53:33.270 --> 53:35.140
>> CRAZY.

53:35.210 --> 53:36.040
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BE THE

53:36.110 --> 53:38.110
FIRST ONE, BUT, XANDER, I JUST

53:38.180 --> 53:39.210
WANTED TO TALK AND SEE WHERE

53:39.280 --> 53:40.010
YOUR HEAD'S AT SO I CAN PREPARE

53:40.080 --> 53:41.910
MY MIND FOR WHATEVER'S COMING.

53:41.980 --> 53:42.950
>> YEAH, IT MAKES SENSE.

53:43.010 --> 53:43.580
>> AND I'LL GO NEXT.

53:43.650 --> 53:44.050
>> LET'S DO SOME INDIVIDUAL

53:44.120 --> 53:45.180
TALKS.

53:45.250 --> 53:46.850
>> TONIGHT, XANDER IS 1,000%

53:46.920 --> 53:48.020
IN THE FINAL THREE.

53:48.090 --> 53:49.290
AND SO, NOW, THE MAJOR TOPIC IS,

53:49.350 --> 53:50.420
WHO ARE YOU GOING TO BRING IN

53:50.490 --> 53:51.190
AND WHO'S DOING FIRE?

53:51.260 --> 53:52.020
I'VE TRIED TO MAKE FIRE EARLY

53:52.090 --> 53:54.760
ON, AND I STRUGGLED A LOT.

53:54.830 --> 53:55.560
AND SO, I'M HOPING AND PRAYING I

53:55.630 --> 53:56.190
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THIS FREAKING

53:56.260 --> 53:57.200
FIRE.

53:57.260 --> 53:59.160
>> I WANT TO HEAR YOUR PITCH.

53:59.230 --> 54:00.030
LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHY SHOULD I

54:00.100 --> 54:00.730
KEEP YOU AROUND?

54:00.800 --> 54:02.130
>> OH, THANKS, DUDE.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.100
>> YEAH.

54:03.170 --> 54:03.770
>> OKAY, SO, I WOULD SAY THAT

54:03.840 --> 54:04.470
YOU STAND A REALLY GOOD CHANCE

54:04.540 --> 54:07.010
OF WINNING, BUT I THINK THAT YOU

54:07.070 --> 54:08.010
KIND OF WOULD DECREASE YOUR

54:08.070 --> 54:09.210
CHANCES JUST A BIT IF YOU

54:09.270 --> 54:10.910
BROUGHT ERIKA TO THE END.

54:10.980 --> 54:12.010
SHE WOULD BE A TOUGH PERSON TO

54:12.080 --> 54:13.040
BEAT.

54:13.110 --> 54:14.880
>> THIS DECISION IS ABOUT

54:14.950 --> 54:15.510
PERCEPTION.

54:15.580 --> 54:18.550
I HAVE THE POWER TO SHOW THE

54:18.620 --> 54:19.880
JURY HOW I'M PLAYING MY GAME

54:19.950 --> 54:20.490
AND SHOW THEM THAT ALL MY

54:20.550 --> 54:23.020
DECISIONS WERE CALCULATED.

54:23.090 --> 54:24.020
I'M A SMART PERSON, AND THEY

54:24.090 --> 54:26.020
NEED TO KNOW THAT.

54:26.090 --> 54:26.990
>> I'M WILLING TO MAKE FIRE,

54:27.060 --> 54:27.630
AND IF I CAN'T, I GO HOME, AND I

54:27.690 --> 54:30.860
GO HOME HAPPY.

54:30.930 --> 54:36.070
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

54:36.130 --> 54:37.170
AT THE SAME TIME, INTUITION IS

54:37.240 --> 54:38.570
SOMETHING THAT'S POWERFUL AND

54:38.640 --> 54:39.240
OFTEN OVERLOOKED.

54:39.300 --> 54:42.640
SO, WHATEVER MY HEART RESTS ON

54:42.710 --> 54:43.270
AND MY HEAD AGREES WITH IS

54:43.340 --> 54:44.010
SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO GO

54:44.080 --> 54:45.210
WITH.

54:45.280 --> 54:48.010
>> IF YOU THINK THAT IT'S BETTER

54:48.080 --> 54:50.150
TO THROW ME IN, I'LL GO IN.

54:50.220 --> 54:51.220
IF YOU THINK YOU WANT TO TAKE

54:51.280 --> 54:53.390
ME, I THINK THERE'S, LIKE, MERIT

54:53.450 --> 54:55.120
TO YOU TAKING ME.

54:55.190 --> 54:56.020
>> OKAY.

54:56.090 --> 54:56.760
I THINK YOU CAN GO BACK UP

54:56.820 --> 54:57.320
BECAUSE I THINK I'VE MADE MY

54:57.390 --> 54:57.920
MIND.

54:57.990 --> 54:58.460
>> OH, REALLY?

54:58.520 --> 54:59.260
>> YEAH.

54:59.320 --> 54:59.920
I'M TAKING YOU.

54:59.990 --> 55:00.430
>> YOU'RE TAKE-- ARE YOU

55:00.490 --> 55:01.560
KIDDING?

55:01.630 --> 55:03.190
WHAT?

55:03.260 --> 55:03.660
>> YEAH, YEAH.

55:03.730 --> 55:05.400
>> OH, MY GOD.

55:05.460 --> 55:06.530
REALLY?

55:06.600 --> 55:07.130
>> YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE GOOD.

55:07.200 --> 55:08.030
>> THAT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS

55:08.100 --> 55:09.200
EXPECTING AT ALL.

55:09.270 --> 55:10.570
I THOUGHT I WAS 100% GOING INTO

55:10.640 --> 55:12.040
FIRE WITH DESHAWN, SO I WAS

55:12.100 --> 55:13.140
SHOCKED.

55:13.200 --> 55:14.010
BUT INSIDE, I'M LIKE, "WAIT, DO

55:14.070 --> 55:15.010
I SUCK?

55:15.070 --> 55:15.670
AM I BEATABLE?

55:15.740 --> 55:16.010
LIKE, WHY DOES HE WANT TO TAKE

55:16.070 --> 55:18.510
<i>ME?"</i>

55:18.580 --> 55:20.050
THE END AND AT LEAST PLEAD MY

55:20.110 --> 55:22.050
CASE, THEN I'LL TAKE IT.

55:22.110 --> 55:23.080
>> YOU MIGHT WANT TO PRACTICE

55:23.150 --> 55:23.520
JUST IN CASE.

55:23.580 --> 55:24.020
LIKE...

55:24.080 --> 55:25.080
>> YEAH.

55:25.150 --> 55:26.220
OH, YEAH, YEAH.

55:26.280 --> 55:27.220
>> NO, I'LL RESPECT THE-- THE

55:27.290 --> 55:28.020
PROCESS AND PRACTICE.

55:28.090 --> 55:29.750
>> YEAH.

55:29.820 --> 55:31.260
>> I THINK ERIKA HAS BUILT A

55:31.320 --> 55:32.020
GOOD RESUME, SO, WHY WOULD I

55:32.090 --> 55:33.190
GIVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE

55:33.260 --> 55:35.530
A FLASHY, FIRE-MAKING MOVE

55:35.590 --> 55:36.190
AT THE END?

55:36.260 --> 55:38.360
SHE'S THE ONLY PERSON HERE WHO

55:38.430 --> 55:39.200
I KNOW FOR SURE CAN MAKE FIRE

55:39.260 --> 55:40.030
BECAUSE SHE DID IT SO MANY TIMES

55:40.100 --> 55:43.030
IN EXILE.

55:43.100 --> 55:44.040
SO, I WAS SAYING THAT I THINK

55:44.100 --> 55:45.200
YOU AND HEATHER ARE GOING TO

55:45.270 --> 55:46.670
FACE OFF.

55:46.740 --> 55:47.010
>> OKAY.

55:47.070 --> 55:49.270
FOR SURE.

55:49.340 --> 55:51.640
>> YEAH, BUT I-- I TOLD ERIKA TO

55:51.710 --> 55:53.810
ALSO PRACTICE JUST BECAUSE IT'S

55:53.880 --> 55:54.680
A HUGE DECISION AND, YOU KNOW?

55:54.750 --> 55:56.010
>> OKAY.

55:56.080 --> 55:57.180
BEING IN THE FIRE-MAKING

55:57.250 --> 55:58.580
CHALLENGE WAS THE LAST THING

55:58.650 --> 56:00.020
I WANTED TO DO.

56:00.090 --> 56:01.150
BUT, ALL SEASON LONG, WE'VE GOT

56:01.220 --> 56:01.750
INGRAINED IN OUR HEAD, YOU'RE

56:01.820 --> 56:03.050
GOING TO HAVE TO WORK FOR

56:03.120 --> 56:03.720
EVERYTHING.

56:03.790 --> 56:06.160
AND SO, ME HAVING TO EARN THIS

56:06.220 --> 56:07.230
SPOT AT THE FINAL TRIBAL COUNCIL

56:07.290 --> 56:08.030
IS, LIKE, PICTURE-PERFECT FOR

56:08.090 --> 56:10.030
THIS SEASON.

56:10.100 --> 56:12.030
SO, GIVE ME A KNIFE, GIVE ME A

56:12.100 --> 56:14.070
FLINT, AND LET ME GO TO WORK.

56:14.130 --> 56:15.200
LIKE, LET ME FIGURE OUT HOW THE

56:15.270 --> 56:16.030
HELL I'M GOING TO PULL THIS OUT,

56:16.100 --> 56:19.370
AND I'M NOT GOING TO STOP UNTIL

56:19.440 --> 56:20.040
I DO BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT

56:20.110 --> 56:21.210
HEATHER CAN PULL OUT OF HER

56:21.270 --> 56:22.410
POCKET.

56:22.470 --> 56:23.740
SHE MAY GO OUT THERE WITH A

56:23.810 --> 56:24.380
FREAKING PIECE OF FLINT AND--

56:24.440 --> 56:27.210
AND KNIFE AND STRIKE IT ONE

56:27.280 --> 56:27.980
TIME, AND-- AND POOF!

56:28.050 --> 56:35.250
>> I CAME INTO THIS GAME AS AN

56:35.320 --> 56:36.050
ABSOLUTE UNDERDOG, THE UNDERDOG

56:36.120 --> 56:38.820
OF ALL UNDERDOGS.

56:38.890 --> 56:39.460
BUT I WORKED HARD TO GET HERE,

56:39.520 --> 56:40.130
AND MY SOCIAL GAME HAS BEEN

56:40.190 --> 56:44.030
REALLY GOOD.

56:44.100 --> 56:45.200
HERE WE GO.

56:45.260 --> 56:46.930
AND NOW, I'M GOING TO EARN MY

56:47.000 --> 56:48.030
SPOT IN THE TOP THREE BY WINNING

56:48.100 --> 56:51.200
THIS FIRE-MAKING CHALLENGE.

56:51.270 --> 56:52.000
IT'S HAPPENING.

56:52.070 --> 56:53.200
>> THERE YOU GO.

56:53.270 --> 56:54.640
>> YOU GOT IT.

56:54.710 --> 56:55.840
THAT WAS, LIKE, SIX SECONDS.

56:55.910 --> 56:56.510
>> WOW.

56:56.570 --> 56:57.210
>> I'D LOVE TO SEE HEATHER IN

56:57.280 --> 57:00.010
THE END BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO

57:00.080 --> 57:01.810
TALK ABOUT THE EXACT SAME THINGS

57:01.880 --> 57:03.210
THAT ERIKA IS GOING TO BRING UP,

57:03.280 --> 57:04.020
BECAUSE THEY WORKED TOGETHER

57:04.080 --> 57:07.050
THIS ENTIRE GAME.

57:07.120 --> 57:08.020
SO, TO HAVE HER COME OUT ON TOP

57:08.090 --> 57:09.220
WOULD TAKE OUT DESHAWN.

57:09.290 --> 57:12.020
IT'LL MAKE ERIKA JUST LOOK WEAK.

57:12.090 --> 57:13.960
YEAH!

57:14.030 --> 57:15.190
AND IF THAT HAPPENS, I DON'T SEE

57:15.260 --> 57:19.230
HOW I<i> COULDN'T</i> WIN.

57:19.300 --> 57:24.040
>> OH!

57:24.100 --> 57:26.640
I'M DEFINITELY FRUSTRATED.

57:26.700 --> 57:27.270
I CAN GET SPARKS WITH THE FLINT

57:27.340 --> 57:28.010
AND-- AND THE KNIFE

57:28.070 --> 57:31.440
CONSISTENTLY.

57:31.510 --> 57:32.080
LIKE, MY SPARK GAME IS CRAZY.

57:32.140 --> 57:33.210
BUT THERE'S NO HEIGHT ON MY

57:33.280 --> 57:34.980
FIRE, AND IT'S REALLY

57:35.050 --> 57:36.050
FRUSTRATING ME BECAUSE IT'S LIKE

57:36.110 --> 57:38.020
ME DOING A SIX-INCH FIRE IS NOT

57:38.080 --> 57:38.750
GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE.

57:38.820 --> 57:39.350
ALL THESE STICKS, AND NOTHING

57:39.420 --> 57:40.020
CAN-- ARE YOU JOKING?

57:40.080 --> 57:43.560
IS THIS A JOKE?

57:43.620 --> 57:44.160
FOR ME, THIS FIRE-MAKING

57:44.220 --> 57:45.190
CHALLENGE MEANS THE WORLD.

57:45.260 --> 57:47.860
I SEE THE MILLION DOLLARS.

57:47.930 --> 57:48.460
I CAN, LIKE, ALMOST REACH OUT

57:48.530 --> 57:50.230
AND TOUCH IT.

57:50.300 --> 57:51.200
BUT IF I CAN'T START A FIRE,

57:51.260 --> 57:52.030
I'LL NEVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

57:52.100 --> 57:54.400
TO GRAB WHAT'S RIGHTFULLY MINE.

57:54.470 --> 57:56.000
SO, IT SUCKS.

57:56.070 --> 58:10.950
>> IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME ON

58:11.020 --> 58:12.020
>> IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME ON

58:12.080 --> 58:15.220
EXILE.

58:15.290 --> 58:19.160
A LONG TIME.

58:19.220 --> 58:20.020
>> OH, MAN!

58:20.090 --> 58:21.230
I THOUGHT, SINCE SHE SPENT SO

58:21.290 --> 58:23.060
MUCH TIME ON EXILE, THAT SHE

58:23.130 --> 58:24.030
KNEW HOW TO MAKE FIRE!

58:24.100 --> 58:26.260
WHAT THE HELL!

58:26.330 --> 58:27.200
SHE CAN'T MAKE FIRE?

58:27.270 --> 58:30.240
OH, MY GOD!

58:30.300 --> 58:31.440
IT'S LIKE, "WHAT?"

58:31.500 --> 58:32.040
AW, MAN!

58:32.100 --> 58:38.280
I-- OH!

58:38.340 --> 58:39.210
SHE'S JUST ADVERTISING THE FACT

58:39.280 --> 58:40.010
THAT I COULD TAKE HER OUT AND

58:40.080 --> 58:43.650
MAKE A BIG MOVE!

58:43.720 --> 58:48.020
>> THANK YOU.

58:48.090 --> 58:49.290
IS THIS A PLOY?

58:49.350 --> 58:50.690
IS SHE JUST DOING THIS TO, LIKE,

58:50.760 --> 58:51.390
TEMPT ME?

58:51.460 --> 58:54.660
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS FIGURED

58:54.730 --> 58:55.660
OUT, BUT I<i> CANNOT</i> BELIEVE SHE

58:55.730 --> 58:59.800
MAKE FIRE.

58:59.860 --> 59:00.500
ALWAYS SAID, UNTIL SHE CAME UP

59:00.570 --> 59:02.630
AND STARTED PRACTICING, AND SHE

59:02.700 --> 59:03.300
CAN'T DO IT.

59:03.370 --> 59:06.100
SO, I CAN EASILY STEP DOWN AND

59:06.170 --> 59:07.670
JUST DO THE FIRE AND GET HER

59:07.740 --> 59:08.270
OUT.

59:08.340 --> 59:11.110
AFTER A WHOLE DAY OF SOLID

59:11.180 --> 59:11.780
DECISION-MAKING AND FEELING

59:11.840 --> 59:15.080
CONFIDENT, SUDDENLY, I GO BACK

59:15.150 --> 59:15.680
TO BEING THAT KID WHO'S NOT

59:15.750 --> 59:18.250
CONFIDENT IN HIMELF AND SO

59:18.320 --> 59:19.980
UNSURE OF HIMSELF.

59:20.050 --> 59:28.030
>> IN THIS SITUATION, ALL YOU

59:28.090 --> 59:31.560
CAN DO IS STRESS.

59:31.630 --> 59:32.200
I EITHER LIVE WITH THE REGRET

59:32.260 --> 59:33.200
OF KNOWING THAT I COULD HAVE

59:33.260 --> 59:36.070
DONE MORE, OR I LEAVE IT ALL OUT

59:36.130 --> 59:39.200
THERE AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT I

59:39.270 --> 59:42.210
GET SENT HOME PACKING.

59:42.270 --> 59:43.910
IT'S TRICKY, BUT, OF COURSE,

59:43.980 --> 59:44.610
IT'S GOING TO BE.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.710
IT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR DECISION.

1:00:19.780 --> 1:00:20.980
>> Probst: SO, XANDER, ARE YOU

1:00:21.050 --> 1:00:22.480
AWARE, AS YOU'RE WALKING UP,

1:00:22.550 --> 1:00:24.350
THAT THE JURY IS GOING TO BE

1:00:24.420 --> 1:00:25.480
CRANING THEIR NECKS TO SEE WHO

1:00:25.550 --> 1:00:26.450
HAS THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:27.650
NECKLACE?

1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:28.950
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.

1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:30.490
I MEAN, FROM A STRATEGIC POINT

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:33.660
OF VIEW, THIS MEANS THAT I GET

1:00:33.730 --> 1:00:34.460
TO MAKE A MAKE-OR-BREAK DECISION

1:00:34.530 --> 1:00:36.760
THAT DETERMINES A LOT IN THIS

1:00:36.830 --> 1:00:37.860
GAME.

1:00:37.930 --> 1:00:38.500
>> Probst: SO, DESHAWN, WHAT DID

1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:39.660
YOU SEE GO DOWN?

1:00:39.730 --> 1:00:41.130
BECAUSE NOW, EVERYBODY'S GOT TO

1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:42.470
WANT TO TALK TO HIM AND PITCH

1:00:42.530 --> 1:00:43.530
THEIR CASE.

1:00:43.600 --> 1:00:45.240
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO HAVE

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:45.900
HAPPEN?

1:00:45.970 --> 1:00:46.600
>> MY IDEAL FINAL THREE WOULD

1:00:46.670 --> 1:00:49.240
HAVE BEEN TO SIT NEXT TO XANDER

1:00:49.310 --> 1:00:50.480
AND HEATHER AT THE END.

1:00:50.540 --> 1:00:51.680
SO, MY RECOMMENDATION TO XANDER

1:00:51.740 --> 1:00:53.810
WAS, "HEY, THROW ERIKA INTO

1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:54.480
FIRE, AND LET THE BEST MAN OR

1:00:54.550 --> 1:00:56.710
WOMAN WIN."

1:00:56.780 --> 1:00:57.680
UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T WIN THE

1:00:57.750 --> 1:00:58.480
NECKLACE, SO I HAVE TO ROCK WITH

1:00:58.550 --> 1:01:00.020
WHATEVER HE HAS PLANNED TONIGHT.

1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:00.920
>> Probst: HOW ABOUT YOU,

1:01:00.990 --> 1:01:01.620
HEATHER?

1:01:01.690 --> 1:01:02.450
>> OUR CONVERSATION WAS A LITTLE

1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:03.690
DIFFERENT.

1:01:03.760 --> 1:01:04.890
IT WAS, "THROW ME INTO FIRE-

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:05.790
MAKING BECAUSE I'M UP FOR THE

1:01:05.860 --> 1:01:06.460
CHALLENGE.

1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:07.560
SO, NO HARD FEELINGS.

1:01:07.630 --> 1:01:09.660
WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO, I'M

1:01:09.730 --> 1:01:10.460
READY."

1:01:10.530 --> 1:01:11.900
>> Probst: XANDER, WERE YOU

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:12.960
SURPRISED BY ANY OF THE THREE IN

1:01:13.030 --> 1:01:14.300
TERMS OF THEIR APPROACH OR THEIR

1:01:14.370 --> 1:01:14.700
ATTITUDE?

1:01:14.770 --> 1:01:15.700
>> NOT REALLY.

1:01:15.770 --> 1:01:17.900
I MEAN, THEY'VE GOT THEIR OWN

1:01:17.970 --> 1:01:18.500
BIASES IN IT, AND I WASN'T

1:01:18.570 --> 1:01:21.570
PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:22.240
BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY BEEN TRYING

1:01:22.310 --> 1:01:24.810
TO MAKE MY DECISION BEFORE IT

1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:26.180
EVEN HAPPENED.

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:26.840
AND A LOT OF THAT ACTUALLY

1:01:26.910 --> 1:01:30.450
STEMS FROM DESHAWN OVER HERE.

1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:32.150
HIS TRUTH BOMB REALLY TOLD ME A

1:01:32.220 --> 1:01:33.680
LOT.

1:01:33.750 --> 1:01:36.590
WHEN HE CRITICIZED ERIKA'S GAME,

1:01:36.650 --> 1:01:38.460
THE JURY SEEMED TO APPLAUD AND

1:01:38.520 --> 1:01:39.690
AGREE WITH HIM, SO THAT'S

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:41.430
SOMETHING THAT I TOOK TO NOTE.

1:01:41.490 --> 1:01:42.460
>> Probst: AND SO, XANDER,

1:01:42.530 --> 1:01:44.360
YOU'RE SAYING, "I'M LOOKING AND

1:01:44.430 --> 1:01:45.630
TRYING TO GET PERCEPTIONS OF

1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:46.460
WHAT I'M HEARING AND WHAT I'VE

1:01:46.530 --> 1:01:48.830
BEEN HEARING OVER THE DAYS,"

1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:50.400
WHICH IS A VERY SMART MOVE

1:01:50.470 --> 1:01:51.670
BECAUSE THIS IS A GAME<i> OF</i>

1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:54.470
AND THE JURY TOMORROW NIGHT IS

1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:57.010
GOING TO TAKE THEIR PERCEPTIONS

1:01:57.080 --> 1:01:57.680
AND PUT THEM SMACK DAB ON TOP OF

1:01:57.740 --> 1:02:00.040
YOU WITH MILLION-DOLLAR VOTES.

1:02:00.110 --> 1:02:02.450
THAT'S WHY THAT POSITION YOU'RE

1:02:02.510 --> 1:02:03.680
IN IS POWERFUL BUT ALSO RISKY.

1:02:03.750 --> 1:02:06.280
>> EXACTLY.

1:02:06.350 --> 1:02:06.950
SO, IT SEEMS THAT THE JURY

1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:09.390
DOESN'T RESPECT ERIKA'S GAME,

1:02:09.450 --> 1:02:10.020
AND THEY DON'T RESPECT HEATHER'S

1:02:10.090 --> 1:02:12.990
GAME.

1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:14.360
AND I GET IT.

1:02:14.430 --> 1:02:14.930
THEY'VE PLAYED VERY SIMILAR

1:02:14.990 --> 1:02:15.690
GAMES.

1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:18.500
BUT I FEEL LIKE HEATHER IS

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:21.700
SOMEONE THAT THEY'VE PINNED AS

1:02:21.770 --> 1:02:22.470
THIS GOAT, YOU KNOW, THIS PERSON

1:02:22.530 --> 1:02:24.070
WHO'S BEEN DRAGGED TO THE END.

1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:25.240
THEY DON'T RESPECT HOW SHE'S

1:02:25.300 --> 1:02:25.870
PLAYED.

1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:26.440
BUT I DON'T THINK HEATHER'S

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:27.670
A GOAT.

1:02:27.740 --> 1:02:29.970
I DISAGREE COMPLETELY.

1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:30.640
I THINK THAT SHE'S SOMEONE WHO

1:02:30.710 --> 1:02:33.440
DEFIES WHAT PEOPLE PIN HER TO

1:02:33.510 --> 1:02:34.150
THE STEREOTYPE OF BEING THE OLD,

1:02:34.210 --> 1:02:37.180
FRAIL LADY, WHEN SHE'S ACTUALLY

1:02:37.250 --> 1:02:38.450
SO STRONG AND SHE'S GOT THIS

1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:39.680
YOUTHFUL VIGOR TO HER.

1:02:39.750 --> 1:02:42.020
AND I THINK THAT SHE MIGHT PROVE

1:02:42.090 --> 1:02:42.550
PEOPLE WRONG, THAT SHE'S A

1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:45.160
BADASS.

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:45.820
>> Probst: ERIKA, ONE OF THE

1:02:45.890 --> 1:02:48.860
TOUGHEST THINGS ABOUT BEING IN

1:02:48.930 --> 1:02:50.460
THE SPOT XANDER IS IN IS THAT

1:02:50.530 --> 1:02:51.700
THE JURY, EVEN UNINTENTIONALLY,

1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:54.470
CAN GIVE A SIGNAL THAT MIGHT BE

1:02:54.530 --> 1:02:56.770
TRUE, MIGHT NOT BE TRUE.

1:02:56.830 --> 1:02:57.670
>> OH, OF COURSE.

1:02:57.740 --> 1:02:58.470
I THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH WE

1:02:58.540 --> 1:03:00.340
CAN'T TALK TO THE JURY, LIKE,

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:01.910
THERE IS STILL INFORMATION WE

1:03:01.970 --> 1:03:02.610
CAN GET FROM HOW THEY REACT.

1:03:02.670 --> 1:03:03.670
BUT IN THE END, LIKE, "HEY, YOU

1:03:03.740 --> 1:03:04.940
WON.

1:03:05.010 --> 1:03:06.010
I RESPECT WHATEVER DECISION YOU

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:06.640
MAKE.

REMAINING PLAYERS WILL HAVE TO

1:03:21.190 --> 1:03:21.830
BATTLE FOR FIRE?

1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:33.670
DESHAWN AND HEATHER ARE GOING TO

DECISION.

ERIKA, YOU'RE GOING TO THE FINAL

COMPLICATED IS, XANDER IS GIVING

1:12:22.530 --> 1:12:26.400
ALSO<i> SO</i> PROUD THAT I'VE MADE IT

1:12:26.470 --> 1:12:29.840
I GOT TO SEE HOW ALL OF THIS

1:12:29.910 --> 1:12:30.510
WORKS AND BE A PART OF SOMETHING

1:12:30.570 --> 1:12:31.610
THAT I'VE LOVED FOR 20 YEARS.

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:33.640
I HOPE I INSPIRE SOME PEOPLE TO

1:12:33.710 --> 1:12:36.050
TRY SOMETHING NEW AND OUTSIDE

1:12:36.110 --> 1:12:37.680
THEIR COMFORT ZONE BECAUSE THE

1:12:37.750 --> 1:12:38.420
REWARD IS<i> SO</i> GREAT.

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:40.720
INDESCRIBABLE.

1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:41.790
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

1:12:56.930 --> 1:12:58.470
>> BEAUTIFUL DAY.

1:12:58.540 --> 1:13:00.270
>> OUR LAST SUNRISE.

1:13:00.340 --> 1:13:00.740
>> ARMS OUT, YOU GUYS.

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:02.470
ARMS OUT!

1:13:02.540 --> 1:13:03.870
SOAKING IT UP.

1:13:03.940 --> 1:13:04.640
YES.

1:13:04.710 --> 1:13:07.910
>> WE DID IT.

1:13:07.980 --> 1:13:08.650
>> YES.

1:13:08.710 --> 1:13:09.810
>> BEING IN THE FINAL THREE IS

1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:10.250
JUST BEAUTIFUL.

1:13:10.310 --> 1:13:11.980
I'M SO GRATEFUL.

1:13:12.050 --> 1:13:12.650
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS

1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:14.080
THE HARDEST SEASON OF

1:13:14.150 --> 1:13:14.750
"SURVIVOR," EVER.

1:13:14.820 --> 1:13:15.890
I THINK I'VE LOST, LIKE, 20 OR

1:13:15.950 --> 1:13:16.650
30 POUNDS.

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:19.420
I-- THESE USED TO BE MUSCLES.

1:13:19.490 --> 1:13:20.660
THIS IS-- WHAT<i> IS</i> THIS?

1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:24.660
LOVED EVERY MOMENT.

1:13:24.730 --> 1:13:26.700
(<i> EXCITED CHATTER</i> )

1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:28.670
(<i> OVERLAPPING CHATTER</i> )

1:13:28.730 --> 1:13:34.300
>> OH, MY GOD!

1:13:34.370 --> 1:13:34.910
>> MY STORY'S BEEN AN UNDERDOG

1:13:34.970 --> 1:13:37.340
STORY.

1:13:37.410 --> 1:13:39.180
I HAD TO WORK MY ASS OFF!

1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:40.510
I WAS ON THE BOTTOM, AND I GOT

1:13:40.580 --> 1:13:41.310
MYSELF HERE.

1:13:41.380 --> 1:13:43.480
"CONGRATULATIONS!

1:13:43.550 --> 1:13:44.750
YOU FOUND A THREE-WAY SHARED

1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:45.320
IMMUNITY."

1:13:45.380 --> 1:13:46.550
I FOUND AN IDOL.

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:48.390
I HAD AN ADVANTAGE.

1:13:48.450 --> 1:13:49.320
I RISKED MY VOTE.

1:13:49.390 --> 1:13:50.790
I<i> DIDN'T</i> HAVE A VOTE FOR A

1:13:50.850 --> 1:13:52.720
THE WAY UP UNTIL THE MERGE.

1:13:52.790 --> 1:13:54.060
(<i> APPLAUSE</i> )

1:13:54.120 --> 1:13:57.260
INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY!

1:13:57.330 --> 1:13:58.060
<i>HUGE</i> EFFORT!

1:13:58.130 --> 1:13:59.400
CHALLENGES.

1:13:59.460 --> 1:14:00.430
I GOT TO CHOOSE WHO GOES TO

1:14:00.500 --> 1:14:01.330
FIRE.

1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:02.970
I MADE JEFF LAUGH.

1:14:03.030 --> 1:14:04.570
I CRIED.

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:05.300
EVERY SINGLE CHECKPOINT ON THE

1:14:05.370 --> 1:14:07.540
"SURVIVOR" BUCKET LIST IS

1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:08.640
CHECKED.

1:14:08.710 --> 1:14:09.340
EXCEPT FOR ONE.

1:14:09.410 --> 1:14:10.540
IT'S WINNING THE $1 MILLION AND

1:14:10.610 --> 1:14:12.980
THE TITLE OF "SOLE SURVIVOR."

1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:13.540
>> TO BE ABLE TO GRILL BACON

1:14:13.610 --> 1:14:16.510
ON THE LAST DAY...

1:14:16.580 --> 1:14:19.520
>> IF I WIN THIS GAME, I WOULD

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:20.680
BE THE YOUNGEST WINNER OF ALL-

1:14:20.750 --> 1:14:21.350
TIME.

1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:25.060
THIS IS MY CHANCE TO BE ONE OF

1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:25.720
THE GREATS, SO I'VE GOT TO GIVE

1:14:25.790 --> 1:14:28.290
EVERY INCH, EVERY FIBER OF MY

1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:28.860
BODY TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN

1:14:28.930 --> 1:14:33.060
SECURE THE WIN.

1:14:33.130 --> 1:14:33.700
>> THIS IS THE BEST BREAKFAST

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:34.570
I'VE EVER HAD.

1:14:34.630 --> 1:14:37.200
>> I FINALLY FEEL MY STOMACH.

1:14:37.270 --> 1:14:37.900
>> I KNOW!

1:14:37.970 --> 1:14:40.540
I FEEL, LIKE, A BIT MORE ALIVE.

1:14:40.600 --> 1:14:41.310
I PLAYED A HELL OF A GAME, BUT I

1:14:41.370 --> 1:14:44.070
GET UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE OF,

1:14:44.140 --> 1:14:46.040
LIKE, HOW I LOOK AND MY SIZE.

1:14:46.110 --> 1:14:47.280
BUT INSIDE, LIKE, I KNOW THAT

1:14:47.340 --> 1:14:50.050
I'M A FIERCE COMPETITOR, A LION

1:14:50.110 --> 1:14:53.280
THAT DRESSED LIKE A LAMB.

1:14:53.350 --> 1:14:54.050
NOW, I HAVE TO BE ROARING.

1:14:54.120 --> 1:14:57.090
IT'S TIME TO SHOW EVERYONE THAT

1:14:57.150 --> 1:14:57.920
I ACTUALLY HAVE TEETH BECAUSE I

1:14:57.990 --> 1:14:58.490
KNOW I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO

1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:00.390
WIN.

1:15:00.460 --> 1:15:02.060
>> Probst: ERIKA WINS INDIVIDUAL

1:15:02.130 --> 1:15:04.190
IMMUNITY.

1:15:04.260 --> 1:15:05.300
>> I WON TWO CHALLENGES, AND I

1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:06.030
FLIPPED THE GAME WHEN I BROKE

1:15:06.100 --> 1:15:09.930
THE HOURGLASS.

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:10.530
I'M PLAYING FOR ME.

1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:14.040
AND, BEHIND THE SCENES, I

1:15:14.100 --> 1:15:16.540
CREATED THE ALLIANCE THAT

1:15:16.610 --> 1:15:17.270
DOMINATED THE ENDGAME, AND I WAS

1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:18.040
ALWAYS MAKING SURE THAT THE

1:15:18.110 --> 1:15:20.280
BIGGEST THREAT TO ME

1:15:20.340 --> 1:15:21.410
WENT HOME.

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:22.080
SO, NOW IS THE TIME FOR THE

1:15:22.150 --> 1:15:26.050
LITTLE FILIPINO IMMIGRANT, THE

1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:27.990
CANADIAN CITIZEN TO TAKE OFF

1:15:28.050 --> 1:15:29.290
THAT LAMB COSTUME AND FIGHT FOR

1:15:29.350 --> 1:15:31.790
THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE.

1:15:31.860 --> 1:15:33.760
NO MATTER WHAT GETS THROWN AT ME

1:15:33.820 --> 1:15:34.360
TONIGHT, I HAVE EVERYTHING IT

1:15:34.420 --> 1:15:37.530
TAKES TO WIN.

1:15:37.590 --> 1:15:38.100
>> I FEEL LIKE I'VE GROWN BY

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:39.900
BEING HERE.

1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:41.300
SO, EVEN THOUGH TONIGHT'S NOT MY

1:15:41.370 --> 1:15:42.030
NIGHT, LIKE, I FEEL GOOD ABOUT

1:15:42.100 --> 1:15:45.800
WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO.

1:15:45.870 --> 1:15:46.470
SO, I'M HAPPY.

1:15:46.540 --> 1:15:47.300
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'VE SURVIVED

1:15:47.370 --> 1:15:49.910
ONE OF THE CRAZIEST SEASONS OF

1:15:49.970 --> 1:15:50.510
"SURVIVOR."

1:15:50.570 --> 1:15:52.410
BUT I DIDN'T ONLY SURVIVE;

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:53.280
LIKE, I THRIVED.

1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:54.040
THIS IS "SURVIVOR," BUT I FEEL

1:15:54.110 --> 1:15:55.480
LIKE A THRIVER.

1:15:55.550 --> 1:15:56.350
>> YEAH, NO, I GOT YOU.

1:15:56.410 --> 1:15:57.850
I GOT YOU.

1:15:57.920 --> 1:15:58.320
>> WAY TO GO, BROTHER!

1:15:58.380 --> 1:15:59.280
LIKE, COME ON!

1:15:59.350 --> 1:16:01.050
>> MY SOCIAL SKILLS GOT ME HERE.

1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:02.050
THIS JOURNEY TAUGHT ME SO MUCH

1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:03.450
ABOUT MYSELF AND RESILIENCE AND

1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:04.960
CONFIDENCE, AND WHO I AM AS A

1:16:05.020 --> 1:16:05.660
PERSON.

1:16:05.720 --> 1:16:06.360
I DIDN'T WIN IMMUNITY, I DIDN'T

1:16:06.420 --> 1:16:08.630
FIND ADVANTAGES, BUT I ACTUALLY

1:16:08.690 --> 1:16:10.060
WORKED MY ASS OFF TO BE HERE.

1:16:10.130 --> 1:16:11.300
>> OH, MY GOD!

1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:14.060
>> Probst: DESHAWN GOT FLAME.

1:16:14.130 --> 1:16:15.930
YOU ARE SAFE, MY FRIEND.

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:17.070
>> OH, MY GOD.

1:16:17.130 --> 1:16:17.670
WINNING THE GAME WOULD BE EPIC

1:16:17.730 --> 1:16:18.370
TO ME.

1:16:18.440 --> 1:16:19.540
THE MONEY WOULD LITERALLY CHANGE

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:21.070
MY LIFE, SO I GOT TO KEEP MY

1:16:21.140 --> 1:16:22.010
FOOT ON THE GAS.

1:16:22.070 --> 1:16:26.040
>> I DON'T REALLY GET NERVOUS.

1:16:26.110 --> 1:16:26.980
>> I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:27.880
(<i> CHUCKLES</i> )

1:16:27.950 --> 1:16:29.280
THREE.

1:16:29.350 --> 1:16:30.050
EVERYBODY HAS A CHANCE TO WIN

1:16:30.110 --> 1:16:31.880
THE $1 MILLION.

1:16:31.950 --> 1:16:33.020
THIS SEASON HAS BEEN A BATTLE

1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:34.050
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:35.290
IT WOULD BE SHAMEFUL IF IT

1:16:35.350 --> 1:16:37.520
DIDN'T END THAT WAY.

1:16:37.590 --> 1:16:38.190
I'M EXCITED FOR IT, AND I'M

1:16:38.260 --> 1:16:40.960
READY TO DO WHAT I GOT TO DO.

1:16:41.020 --> 1:16:41.530
GIVE ME THE BELT.

1:16:41.590 --> 1:16:44.660
I WANT TO BE THE CHAMP.

1:16:44.730 --> 1:16:59.610
>> Probst: ALL RIGHT!

1:16:59.680 --> 1:17:12.760
>> Probst: ALL RIGHT!

1:17:12.820 --> 1:17:14.060
HERE WE ARE, THE LAST DAY OF

"SURVIVOR 41."

1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:18.000
DESHAWN, ERIKA, XANDER, YOU DID

1:17:18.060 --> 1:17:22.030
WHAT YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WHEN

1:17:22.100 --> 1:17:23.300
YOU DREAM OF PLAYING THIS GAME:

1:17:23.370 --> 1:17:24.840
PUT YOURSELF INTO A POSITION TO

1:17:24.900 --> 1:17:26.040
WIN.

1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:27.200
THIS IS THE LAST PHASE.

1:17:27.270 --> 1:17:27.800
THE LAST STAGE OF THE GAME IS,

1:17:27.870 --> 1:17:29.270
YOU'VE GOT TO CLAIM YOUR

1:17:29.340 --> 1:17:30.040
VICTORY.

1:17:30.110 --> 1:17:33.240
WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT "SURVIVOR"

1:17:33.310 --> 1:17:34.040
IS, A GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT YOU

1:17:34.110 --> 1:17:35.280
HELPED TO VOTE OUT ARE THE ONES

1:17:35.350 --> 1:17:37.550
IN CONTROL.

1:17:37.610 --> 1:17:38.250
SO, TONIGHT, THEY'RE GOING TO

1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:41.280
INTERROGATE YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE

1:17:41.350 --> 1:17:43.550
MAKING A MILLION-DOLLAR VOTE.

1:17:43.620 --> 1:17:44.290
SO, THEY'RE GOING TO ASK YOU

1:17:44.350 --> 1:17:45.190
QUESTIONS AT TIMES MAY SEEM

1:17:45.260 --> 1:17:45.860
TOUGH.

1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:46.390
THEY MAY PUSH YOU AROUND A

1:17:46.460 --> 1:17:47.290
LITTLE BIT.

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:49.260
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET YOU

1:17:49.330 --> 1:17:50.090
TO STAND UP AND PROVE TO THEM

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:52.060
WHY<i> YOU</i> DESERVE THE TITLE OF

1:17:52.130 --> 1:17:54.970
MILLION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT.

1:17:55.030 --> 1:17:56.930
SO, I'M GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY

1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:57.600
A MINUTE, COMPOSE THEMSELVES.

1:17:57.670 --> 1:17:58.140
JURY WILL GET READY WITH THEIR

ANSWER.

1:18:01.570 --> 1:18:03.570
AND THEN, WE WILL GO.

1:18:17.890 --> 1:18:18.590
>> Probst: ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME

1:18:18.660 --> 1:18:20.690
TO GET TO OUR FINAL TRIBAL

1:18:20.760 --> 1:18:23.130
COUNCIL Q&A FROM THE JURY.

1:18:23.190 --> 1:18:24.960
WHO WANTS TO GET US STARTED?

1:18:25.030 --> 1:18:25.800
EVVIE, HAND UP.

WANT TO START BY SAYING<i> HUGE</i>

1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:32.540
OF YOU.

1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:34.400
I THINK WE ALL CAN ATTEST THAT

1:18:34.470 --> 1:18:35.570
THIS IS ONE OF THE TOUGHEST

1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:36.540
SEASONS "SURVIVOR'S" EVER HAD,

1:18:36.610 --> 1:18:37.810
AND THE THREE OF YOU ARE SITTING

1:18:37.870 --> 1:18:39.940
HERE AT THE VERY, VERY END.

1:18:40.010 --> 1:18:40.610
SO, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

1:18:40.680 --> 1:18:42.480
SHOULD BE EXTREMELY PROUD OF.

1:18:42.550 --> 1:18:43.650
AND GIVEN, YOU KNOW, THE

1:18:43.710 --> 1:18:44.350
BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY THAT

1:18:44.410 --> 1:18:46.250

1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:48.290
IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL FINAL THREE

1:18:48.350 --> 1:18:48.950
THAT REFLECTS THAT.

1:18:49.020 --> 1:18:51.490
HOWEVER, THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:52.560
BEING A WONDERFUL FINAL THREE

1:18:52.620 --> 1:18:54.120
IS THAT EACH OF YOU IS UP

1:18:54.190 --> 1:18:55.290
AGAINST TWO PEOPLE THAT HAVE A

1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:55.890
VERY GOOD SHOT OF GETTING SOME

1:18:55.960 --> 1:18:57.790
VOTES TONIGHT.

1:18:57.860 --> 1:18:58.430
SO, GOOD LUCK.

1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:00.000
KEEP MAKING ME PROUD.

1:19:00.060 --> 1:19:00.700
IT'S ALL YOU.

1:19:04.700 --> 1:19:07.440
KNOWS NOW THAT I HAVE A HISTORY

1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:08.070
OF-- OF BEING A PROFESSIONAL

1:19:08.140 --> 1:19:12.540
ATHLETE, SO I TEND TO BREAK

1:19:12.610 --> 1:19:13.810
THINGS DOWN, ESPECIALLY COMPLEX

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:16.280
GAMES AND COMPETITIONS, INTO

1:19:16.350 --> 1:19:16.950
PHASES OR QUARTERS.

1:19:17.010 --> 1:19:19.380
AND "SURVIVOR'S" NO DIFFERENT.

1:19:19.450 --> 1:19:20.020
THIS GAME CAN BE BROKEN DOWN

1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:22.250
INTO PRE-MERGE, POST-MERGE,

1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:23.290
FINAL EIGHT.

1:19:23.350 --> 1:19:24.550
WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU ALLOW

1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:25.820
YOURSELF TO HAVE A GAME PLAN.

1:19:25.890 --> 1:19:28.390
SO, I'D REALLY LIKE TO HEAR YOU

1:19:28.460 --> 1:19:29.060
EXPLAIN YOUR GAME PLAN COMING

1:19:29.130 --> 1:19:31.760
INTO THE GAME, AND HOW YOU'VE

1:19:31.830 --> 1:19:32.530
ADAPTED IT TO GET HERE.

1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:34.800
LET'S START WITH XANDER.

1:19:34.870 --> 1:19:36.170
>> SO, GOING INTO THIS GAME,

1:19:36.230 --> 1:19:36.830
I KNOW A LOT OF FANS LIKE TO SAY

1:19:36.900 --> 1:19:37.800
THEY WANT TO PLAY A TONY-STYLE

1:19:37.870 --> 1:19:39.640
GAME, OR THEY WANT TO PLAY A

1:19:39.700 --> 1:19:40.540
SPENCER-STYLE GAME.

1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:42.540
I REALLY WANTED TO PLAY A

1:19:42.610 --> 1:19:43.810
XANDER-STYLE GAME.

1:19:43.870 --> 1:19:46.440
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

1:19:46.510 --> 1:19:47.840
DIFFERENT, AND GO WITH MY GUT,

1:19:47.910 --> 1:19:48.550
TAKE BIG RISKS.

1:19:48.610 --> 1:19:49.810
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID.

1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:52.550
AND GOING INTO QUARTER ONE,

1:19:52.620 --> 1:19:54.380
I KNEW THAT FROM MY BACKGROUND

1:19:54.450 --> 1:19:55.820
IN ATHLETICS, IN RUNNING

1:19:55.890 --> 1:19:56.550
CROSS COUNTRY AND TRACK, I KNOW

1:19:56.620 --> 1:20:00.460
THAT TEAM DYNAMIC IS STRONG.

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:01.090
SO, IN YASE, I WANTED TO BE THE

1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:03.330
WORKHORSE FOR THE TRIBE.

1:20:03.390 --> 1:20:04.460
I WANTED TO SHARE ADVANTAGES.

1:20:04.530 --> 1:20:05.130
I WANTED TO SAY THAT WE COULD

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.800
WORK TOGETHER AND STAY STRONG.

1:20:07.860 --> 1:20:08.530
SO, THAT WAS QUARTER ONE, WAS

1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:10.200
TEAM DYNAMIC.

1:20:10.270 --> 1:20:11.130
AND...

1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:12.540
(<i> CHUCKLES</i> )

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:15.710
WE WERE DOWN IN NUMBERS.

1:20:15.770 --> 1:20:16.570
EVERYBODY KNEW I HAD AN IDOL,

1:20:16.640 --> 1:20:18.280
BECAUSE I HAD TO SAY THE

1:20:18.340 --> 1:20:19.040
BUTTERFLY THING, AND A LOT

1:20:19.110 --> 1:20:19.840
OF PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT THE

1:20:19.910 --> 1:20:20.540
EXTRA VOTE.

1:20:20.610 --> 1:20:23.210
I WAS THE LONE SOLDIER.

1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:24.310
SO I MARKET MYSELF.

1:20:24.380 --> 1:20:24.780
I SAY, "I'M A NUMBER.

1:20:24.850 --> 1:20:25.820
YOU CAN USE ME.

1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:27.450
<i>PLEASE."</i>

1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:30.150
STARTED CRUMBLING, THE SIDE

1:20:30.220 --> 1:20:31.820
THAT I FELT MOST COMFORTABLE

1:20:31.890 --> 1:20:32.560
WITH WAS GOING WITH RICARD.

1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:36.490
SO, THIRD QUARTER: FINAL EIGHT.

1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:37.130
THIS WAS THE PHASE OF MY GAME

1:20:37.190 --> 1:20:37.830
THAT WAS KEEPING RICARD AS A

1:20:37.890 --> 1:20:39.930
SHIELD.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:40.630
HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON THAT

1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:43.830
EVERYBODY WAS SO VEHEMENT ABOUT

1:20:43.900 --> 1:20:44.530
GETTING OUT INSTEAD OF ME.

1:20:44.600 --> 1:20:47.300
BUT IT WAS A GAMBLE, AND I HAD

1:20:47.370 --> 1:20:48.540
TO TURN ON HIM EVENTUALLY, EVEN

1:20:48.610 --> 1:20:49.840
THOUGH I LOVED HIM, BECAUSE I

1:20:49.910 --> 1:20:52.140
HAD AN IDOL AND I KNEW I WAS

1:20:52.210 --> 1:20:52.640
SAFE TO GET TO THE END.

1:20:52.710 --> 1:20:54.080
>> GOT YOU.

1:20:54.140 --> 1:20:55.050
THANKS-- THANKS, MAN.

1:20:55.110 --> 1:20:55.810
>> AND ALSO, XANDER, YOU STEPPED

1:20:55.880 --> 1:20:59.050
FORWARD TO GET RICE POST-MERGE

1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:00.550
FOR THE ENTIRE TRIBE.

1:21:00.620 --> 1:21:01.820
AND ALSO, THE REWARD CHALLENGE,

1:21:01.890 --> 1:21:03.020
YOU SWAPPED THE SPOT WITH ERIKA.

1:21:03.090 --> 1:21:03.990
>> YEAH.

1:21:04.050 --> 1:21:04.590
>> I FELT THAT-- THAT WAS YOUR

1:21:04.650 --> 1:21:07.820
SOCIAL ASPECT OF THE GAME.

1:21:07.890 --> 1:21:10.090
IN-- IN ADDITION TO THAT,

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:11.330
ONE DAY, I WAS REALLY THINKING

1:21:11.390 --> 1:21:12.530
ABOUT MY FAMILY AND EVERYTHING.

1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:13.830
THEN, YOU CAME AND TOLD ME,

1:21:13.900 --> 1:21:16.530
"IF YOU NEED TO HUG IT OUT,

1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:17.830
BROTHER, I'M THERE FOR YOU."

1:21:17.900 --> 1:21:19.840
THAT WAS SO KIND.

1:21:19.900 --> 1:21:20.540
YOU-- YOU HAVE VERY KIND HEART.

1:21:20.600 --> 1:21:23.510
YOU ARE VERY SOCIAL THERE.

1:21:23.570 --> 1:21:24.540
I'M PROUD OF YOU FOR THAT.

1:21:24.610 --> 1:21:25.840
>> THANK YOU, NASEER.

1:21:25.910 --> 1:21:28.550
>> MY BUDDY DESHAWN, YOUR GAME

1:21:28.610 --> 1:21:30.910
PLAN TO GET YOU TO THIS POINT?

1:21:30.980 --> 1:21:31.820
>> YEAH, SO, COMING INTO

1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:32.550
"SURVIVOR," LIKE, I'M A

1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:34.550
HUGE FAN, SO I KNOW THAT

1:21:34.620 --> 1:21:36.120
THE FOUNDATION OF "SURVIVOR" IS

1:21:36.190 --> 1:21:36.720
THE SOCIAL GAME.

1:21:36.790 --> 1:21:37.820
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY

1:21:37.890 --> 1:21:38.760
COMPETITIONS YOU WIN, IT

1:21:38.820 --> 1:21:39.520
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MANY

1:21:39.590 --> 1:21:40.560
ADVANTAGES YOU FIND.

1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:42.530
AND SO, FIRST HALF, FIRST

1:21:42.590 --> 1:21:43.830
QUARTER OF MY GAME, IT WAS ABOUT

1:21:43.890 --> 1:21:44.560
BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.

1:21:44.630 --> 1:21:46.960
SO, I TALKED TO PEOPLE LIKE

1:21:47.030 --> 1:21:47.860
HEATHER, AND WE BECAME REALLY,

1:21:47.930 --> 1:21:48.530
REALLY CLOSE.

1:21:48.600 --> 1:21:49.830
I TALKED TO PEOPLE LIKE ERIKA.

1:21:49.900 --> 1:21:51.200
WE BECAME CLOSE.

1:21:51.270 --> 1:21:52.540
NASEER AND I WERE LIKE BROTHERS

1:21:52.600 --> 1:21:54.140
BY THE END OF THE JOURNEY.

1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:55.610
SO, MOVING ON TO THE SECOND

1:21:55.670 --> 1:21:56.310
QUARTER OF THE GAME WHERE WE'RE

1:21:56.370 --> 1:21:58.810
TALKING ABOUT POST-MERGE, LIKE,

1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:00.240
I SOON FOUND OUT THAT I WAS ON

1:22:00.310 --> 1:22:00.940
THE BLOCK, WHICH CLUED ME IN

1:22:01.010 --> 1:22:01.810
THAT I WAS PROBABLY A BIG THREAT

1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:03.050
IN THIS GAME.

1:22:03.110 --> 1:22:04.550
AND SO, IT'S AMAZING THAT I'M

1:22:04.610 --> 1:22:05.520
SITTING HERE, BUT IT'S BECAUSE

1:22:05.580 --> 1:22:06.650
OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS FROM THE

1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:07.820
FIRST HALF.

1:22:07.880 --> 1:22:08.550
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE PLAYED A

1:22:08.620 --> 1:22:10.750
PIVOTAL ROLE IN BEING THE GLUE

1:22:10.820 --> 1:22:11.760
OF PEOPLE TO VOTE TOGETHER, YOU

1:22:11.820 --> 1:22:12.560
KNOW-- JUST KEEPING THAT

1:22:12.620 --> 1:22:13.820
CAMARADERIE ALIVE, ALWAYS

1:22:13.890 --> 1:22:15.860
SHUTTING DOWN NEGATIVITY, FOR

1:22:15.930 --> 1:22:16.560
SURE.

1:22:16.630 --> 1:22:17.230
AND, YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GOING TO

1:22:17.290 --> 1:22:18.760
TALK ABOUT THE LAST QUARTER OF

1:22:18.830 --> 1:22:19.800
THE GAME, THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL

1:22:19.860 --> 1:22:20.400
SOCIAL CAPITAL.

1:22:20.460 --> 1:22:20.930
AND THAT, IN THIS GAME, IS

1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:22.570
INVALUABLE.

1:22:22.630 --> 1:22:23.430
SO, FOR ME, I KNOW IT'S GOING TO

1:22:23.500 --> 1:22:24.530
BE TOUGH TO GET TO THE END, AND

1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:25.840
THAT'S HOW I DID IT.

1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:27.240
>> THANK YOU.

1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:28.510
>> MAY I INTERJECT SOMETHING IN

1:22:28.570 --> 1:22:30.370
REGARDS TO KEEPING EVERYBODY

1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:31.110
TOGETHER AND CAMARADERIE WITH

1:22:31.170 --> 1:22:31.840
LUVU?

1:22:31.910 --> 1:22:35.850
>> MM-HMM.

1:22:35.910 --> 1:22:36.550
>> THAT SOUNDS<i> NICE.</i>

1:22:36.610 --> 1:22:38.150
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THE FIRST

1:22:38.210 --> 1:22:40.350
DAY OF THE MERGE...

1:22:40.420 --> 1:22:41.050
>> MM-HMM.

1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:43.820
>> ...YOUR INTENTION WAS TO PULL

1:22:43.890 --> 1:22:44.550
ALL OF US ASIDE AND SAY HOW SHE

1:22:44.620 --> 1:22:47.960
NEEDS TO GO; SYDNEY SHOULD LEAVE

1:22:48.020 --> 1:22:48.630
SO THAT DANNY WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT

1:22:48.690 --> 1:22:49.830
TO DO WITH HIS GAME; THAT YOU

1:22:49.890 --> 1:22:51.860
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A DEEP

1:22:51.930 --> 1:22:52.530
CONNECTION WITH HEATHER, YOU

1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:54.260
WERE JUST TRYING TO BE NICE TO

1:22:54.330 --> 1:22:55.500
HER?

1:22:55.570 --> 1:22:56.170
BASICALLY, YOU THREW<i> EVERYONE</i>

1:22:56.230 --> 1:22:59.600
REALLY TIE INTO WHAT YOU JUST

1:22:59.670 --> 1:23:00.540
SAID?

1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:01.840
>> SO, I REALLY RESPECT YOUR

1:23:01.910 --> 1:23:04.510
QUESTION A LOT, BUT I DON'T

1:23:04.570 --> 1:23:06.510
THINK THAT EVERYTHING THAT YOU

1:23:06.580 --> 1:23:07.810
MENTIONED THERE WAS TRUE.

1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:08.550
WHAT I CAN DEFINITELY SAY IS

1:23:08.610 --> 1:23:10.580
THAT I DID SEE ERIKA AS A BIG

1:23:10.650 --> 1:23:11.950
THREAT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

1:23:12.020 --> 1:23:12.580
THAT'S TRUE.

1:23:12.650 --> 1:23:13.280
DANNY, I ACTUALLY DEFINITELY

1:23:13.350 --> 1:23:14.880
REMEMBER SAYING, LIKE, HE HASN'T

1:23:14.950 --> 1:23:15.620
HAD MUCH OF A GAME, AND HE

1:23:15.690 --> 1:23:16.590
WANTED TO PLAY THE GAME A LITTLE

1:23:16.650 --> 1:23:18.960
BIT MORE SLOW.

1:23:19.020 --> 1:23:19.820
BUT FOR ME, MY<i> TRUEST</i>

1:23:19.890 --> 1:23:22.560
HONEST HERE-- I NEVER WANTED

1:23:22.630 --> 1:23:23.390
DANNY OUT OF THE GAME.

1:23:23.460 --> 1:23:24.490
I NEVER ACTUALLY WANTED HEATHER

1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:25.130
OUT OF THE GAME.

1:23:25.200 --> 1:23:25.430
DID I WANT ERIKA OUT OF THE

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:25.830
GAME?

1:23:25.900 --> 1:23:28.530
I KIND OF DID.

1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:30.330
SO, IF THOSE COMMENTS CAME OUT,

1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:31.840
I 1,000% APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

1:23:31.900 --> 1:23:33.600
AND THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH.

1:23:33.670 --> 1:23:34.370
>> AND THEN, ER-- ERIKA,

1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:35.310
PLEASE.

1:23:35.370 --> 1:23:36.540
>> OH, YEAH!

1:23:36.610 --> 1:23:37.840
I MEAN, I HAD A LOT OF

1:23:37.910 --> 1:23:40.280
EXPECTATIONS ON HOW THIS SEASON

1:23:40.340 --> 1:23:40.980
WAS GOING TO GO FOR ME.

1:23:41.040 --> 1:23:43.410
AND I THOUGHT, I'M GOING TO COME

1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:44.110
IN, BE A SWEET LAMB, JOIN THE

1:23:44.180 --> 1:23:46.580
BOTTOM OF THE MAJORITY ALLIANCE,

1:23:46.650 --> 1:23:48.120
VOTE WITH THEM FOR THE FIRST

1:23:48.180 --> 1:23:48.720
VOTE, AND THEN SLOWLY START TO

1:23:48.790 --> 1:23:49.820
WORK MY WAY UP.

1:23:49.890 --> 1:23:52.560
BUT THE BLESSING AND THE CURSE

1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:54.620
OF LUVU IS WE KEPT WINNING, SO

1:23:54.690 --> 1:23:55.830
WE NEVER<i> HAD</i> TO VOTE.

1:23:55.890 --> 1:23:58.130
AND ELIMINATING PEOPLE, BUT WE

1:23:58.190 --> 1:23:59.900
WERE STARTING TO SEE

1:23:59.960 --> 1:24:00.600
RELATIONSHIPS SHIFT.

1:24:00.660 --> 1:24:01.830
AND WHEN IT CAME TO HEATHER AND

1:24:01.900 --> 1:24:04.530
I, WE BECAME THE UNLIKELY

1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:06.370
DYNAMIC DUO THAT DECIDED, YOU

1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:07.840
KNOW, "LET'S GO KICK ASS AT THE

1:24:07.900 --> 1:24:08.540
MERGE."

1:24:08.610 --> 1:24:10.670
AND, OF COURSE, I DON'T EVEN GO

1:24:10.740 --> 1:24:11.370
TO THE MERGE; I GO LIVE ALONE ON

1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:13.840
EXILE, AND SOCIALLY I'M DOWN AND

1:24:13.910 --> 1:24:15.950
OUT OF THE GAME.

1:24:16.010 --> 1:24:16.650
I COME BACK, I FLIP OVER THE

1:24:16.710 --> 1:24:19.850
GAME, AND WHAT I REALLY NOTICED

1:24:19.920 --> 1:24:22.320
WAS THE OPPORTUNITY WITH THE

1:24:22.390 --> 1:24:24.550
PEOPLE WHO WERE EITHER ON THE

1:24:24.620 --> 1:24:25.560
BOTTOM, FELT LIKE THEY WERE ON

1:24:25.620 --> 1:24:26.260
THE OUTS.

1:24:26.320 --> 1:24:28.220
SO, I STARTED SOCIALLY TO SOW MY

1:24:28.290 --> 1:24:28.890
SEEDS WITH THOSE PEOPLE AND

1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:31.490
BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM

1:24:31.560 --> 1:24:32.100
NOW SO THAT I CAN REAP THIS

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:34.460
HARVEST LATER IN THE GAME,

1:24:34.530 --> 1:24:35.530
MAYBE UNNOTICED.

1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:36.530
I THINK SOME PEOPLE NOTICED.

1:24:36.600 --> 1:24:37.470
I KNOW SHAN NOTICED, AND THAT'S

1:24:37.530 --> 1:24:38.100
WHY I REALLY WANTED TO TAKE OUT

1:24:38.170 --> 1:24:40.540
SHAN.

1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:42.710
AND THEN, I FOUND MYSELF IN THE

1:24:42.770 --> 1:24:43.840
MAJORITY ALLIANCE THAT DOMINATED

1:24:43.910 --> 1:24:46.240
THE LATE STAGE OF THE GAME.

1:24:46.310 --> 1:24:47.580
WHEN I LOOKED AT THE FINAL SIX,

1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:48.550
I KNEW, NO MATTER WHAT

1:24:48.610 --> 1:24:51.480
COMBINATION OF FINAL FIVE, I HAD

1:24:51.550 --> 1:24:52.550
SET MYSELF UP WITH ENOUGH

1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:54.980
POTENTIAL ALLIES TO KNOW THAT I

1:24:55.050 --> 1:24:55.820
HAD A SHOT TO SIT IN THE FINAL

1:24:55.890 --> 1:24:56.550
THREE.

1:24:56.620 --> 1:24:58.390
>> GOT YOU.

1:24:58.460 --> 1:24:59.390
THANK YOU.

1:24:59.460 --> 1:25:00.520
>> ERIKA, YOU HAD A VERY

1:25:00.590 --> 1:25:01.830
FANTASTIC GAME.

1:25:01.890 --> 1:25:03.730
>> THANK YOU.

1:25:03.790 --> 1:25:04.530
>> I ADORE YOU.

1:25:04.590 --> 1:25:07.560
I REALLY TRUST YOU.

1:25:07.630 --> 1:25:08.200
AND WHAT'S UNFORTUNATE IS, YOU

1:25:08.260 --> 1:25:10.330
LACKED THAT SOCIAL GAME WITH

1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:12.540
MOST OF THE JURY, AND SO THEY

1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:13.840
DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO.

1:25:13.900 --> 1:25:15.210
AND I'M JUST LIKE, "OH, I WISH

1:25:15.270 --> 1:25:16.210
YOU COULD ALL SEE IT!"

1:25:16.270 --> 1:25:16.870
>> I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

1:25:16.940 --> 1:25:18.140
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S UNFORTUNATE.

1:25:18.210 --> 1:25:19.210
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:19.840
SAID ABOUT HAVING A RELATIONSHIP

1:25:19.910 --> 1:25:20.540
WITH EVERYBODY, LIKE DESHAWN

1:25:20.610 --> 1:25:22.510
DID, BECAUSE THAT ALSO MADE IT

1:25:22.580 --> 1:25:24.250
EASIER FOR HIM TO BETRAY

1:25:24.310 --> 1:25:24.950
EVERYBODY.

1:25:25.010 --> 1:25:27.420
SO, DID YOU CHOOSE TO ONLY HAVE

1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:28.550
RELATIONSHIPS WITH CERTAIN

1:25:28.620 --> 1:25:30.150
INDIVIDUALS?

1:25:30.220 --> 1:25:31.690
CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN THAT?

1:25:31.750 --> 1:25:32.360
>> THIS IS A GREAT DISCUSSION

1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:33.960
BECAUSE, FOR ME, WHAT KIND OF

1:25:34.020 --> 1:25:35.530
DRIVES ME CRAZY WATCHING

1:25:35.590 --> 1:25:36.560
"SURVIVOR" IS THE PERCEPTION

1:25:36.630 --> 1:25:37.830
THAT HAVING A STRONG SOCIAL

1:25:37.890 --> 1:25:40.300
GAME IS FEELING LIKE YOU HAVE

1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:40.960
STRONG TIES WITH EVERYONE.

1:25:41.030 --> 1:25:43.470
BUT I THINK THAT HAVING A-- A

1:25:43.530 --> 1:25:44.170
STRONG COMMAND OF THE SOCIAL

1:25:44.230 --> 1:25:46.800
GAME IS KNOWING WHERE YOU STAND

1:25:46.870 --> 1:25:48.300
AND WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF

1:25:48.370 --> 1:25:48.970
DOING.

1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:49.840
SO, I KNEW I WANTED TO BE KIND

1:25:49.910 --> 1:25:52.540
TO EVERYBODY, BUT I KNOW THAT I

1:25:52.610 --> 1:25:54.380
DO BETTER IN ONE-ON-ONE

1:25:54.440 --> 1:25:55.450
CONNECTIONS AND, LIKE, SMALLER

1:25:55.510 --> 1:25:56.110
CONNECTIONS.

1:25:56.180 --> 1:25:57.680
SO, I'M NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON

1:25:57.750 --> 1:25:58.480
WHO'S GOING TO BE BEST FRIENDS

1:25:58.550 --> 1:26:00.220
WITH ALL OF YOU, EVEN THOUGH

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:00.780
I THINK IT<i> COULD</i> HAPPEN.

1:26:00.850 --> 1:26:04.290
FACETIME.

1:26:04.350 --> 1:26:04.950
AND I THINK A BIG PART OF MY

1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:07.060
SOCIAL GAME IS MY RELATIONSHIP

1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:07.820
WITH HEATHER.

1:26:07.890 --> 1:26:09.890
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE SAW MY

1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:11.030
RELATIONSHIP WITH HEATHER, I WAS

1:26:11.090 --> 1:26:12.530
LIKE-- I WAS THE BRAINS OF THE

1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:13.830
OPERATION, OR HEATHER WAS JUST,

1:26:13.900 --> 1:26:15.230
LIKE, AN EXTRA VOTE THAT I

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:16.570
DRAGGED AROUND.

1:26:16.630 --> 1:26:18.100
BUT THAT WAS<i> NOT</i> TRUE.

1:26:18.170 --> 1:26:20.540
HOW THIS DUO COULD WORK TOGETHER

1:26:20.600 --> 1:26:23.310
EVEN WHEN THERE IS A PUBLIC

1:26:23.370 --> 1:26:23.940
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO SPLIT US UP,

1:26:24.010 --> 1:26:24.540
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE TRUTH

1:26:24.610 --> 1:26:25.840
BOMB.

1:26:25.910 --> 1:26:28.480
IT'S WILD TO ME THAT WE WERE A

1:26:28.550 --> 1:26:30.050
KNOWN PAIR, AND WE STILL WERE

1:26:30.110 --> 1:26:31.810
ABLE TO MAKE IT INTO THE TOP

1:26:31.880 --> 1:26:32.550
FOUR, WHICH IS SO RARE.

1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:35.520
I WISH I GOT TO KNOW MORE

1:26:35.590 --> 1:26:36.550
PEOPLE, BUT I KNEW SOCIALLY,

1:26:36.620 --> 1:26:37.520
LIKE, WHAT I WAS CAPABLE OF IN

1:26:37.590 --> 1:26:38.120
THIS GAME, AND I PLAYED WITHIN

1:26:38.190 --> 1:26:40.260
THAT.

1:26:40.320 --> 1:26:40.920
>> WELL, THANK YOU, AND I HOPE

1:26:40.990 --> 1:26:43.660
YOU'RE ABLE TO PROVE YOUR GAME

1:26:43.730 --> 1:26:44.360
TO THIS JURY.

1:26:44.430 --> 1:26:47.000
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR XANDER.

1:26:47.060 --> 1:26:48.400
WHAT WAS YOUR PERCEPTION OF

1:26:48.460 --> 1:26:49.100
WHERE YOU STOOD WITH YASE GOING

1:26:49.170 --> 1:26:49.830
INTO THE MERGE, AND HOW DID THAT

1:26:49.900 --> 1:26:52.540
SPEAK TO YOUR OVERALL SOCIAL

1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:53.840
GAME?

1:26:53.900 --> 1:26:55.610
>> GOING INTO THE MERGE, I WAS

1:26:55.670 --> 1:26:56.270
GOING TO LOOK LIKE SOMEONE WHO

1:26:56.340 --> 1:26:58.170
IS MAYBE AN YASE-TYPE, SOMEONE

1:26:58.240 --> 1:26:59.510
WOULD BE GOOD AT CHALLENGES

1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:00.540
AND THOSE PEOPLE, THEY JUST

1:27:00.610 --> 1:27:01.840
DON'T MAKE IT FAR.

1:27:01.910 --> 1:27:03.080
BUT WE SANG IN THE RAIN

1:27:03.150 --> 1:27:04.550
TOGETHER.

1:27:04.610 --> 1:27:05.720
IT WAS-- IT WAS CUTE.

1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:07.050
(<i> LAUGHS</i> )

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:08.550
YOU GUYS WOULD KEEP ME AROUND.

1:27:08.620 --> 1:27:10.720
AND I-- I GENUINELY DID WANT TO

1:27:10.790 --> 1:27:12.360
PROTECT YOU GUYS.

1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:13.060
IT'S JUST, AT A CERTAIN POINT,

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:16.560
IT WAS SO DETRIMENTAL TO MY GAME

1:27:16.630 --> 1:27:18.490
THAT I HAD TO ADAPT.

1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:19.130
AND YEAH, IT HURT, BUT THERE WAS

1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:19.830
NOTHING I COULD DO AT THAT

1:27:19.900 --> 1:27:20.530
POINT.

1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:22.170
MY HANDS WERE TIED.

1:27:22.230 --> 1:27:23.200
>> BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY, I

1:27:23.270 --> 1:27:24.170
WANTED TO ASK, WAS THERE A POINT

1:27:24.230 --> 1:27:24.830
IN THE GAME WHERE YOU HAD A GOOD

1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:25.840
READ IN TERMS OF SOCIAL

1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:27.240
AWARENESS WHERE YOU USE THAT TO

1:27:27.300 --> 1:27:28.540
YOUR ADVANTAGE TO MAKE A MOVE IN

1:27:28.610 --> 1:27:29.140
THE GAME?

1:27:29.210 --> 1:27:31.840
>> YEAH.

1:27:31.910 --> 1:27:35.950
I WOULD SAY--

1:27:36.010 --> 1:27:36.550
I WOULD SAY MY SOCIAL

1:27:36.610 --> 1:27:42.490
AWARENESS...

1:27:42.550 --> 1:27:43.820
>> LIKE, AN EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL

1:27:43.890 --> 1:27:44.550
AWARENESS IS, I KNEW ABOUT YOUR

1:27:44.620 --> 1:27:46.320
ADVANTAGE THE MINUTE THAT YOU

1:27:46.390 --> 1:27:47.490
HAD IT, BUT YOU ASSUMED THAT I

1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:48.120
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT, AND I USED

1:27:48.190 --> 1:27:48.690
THAT TO MY ADVANTAGE IN THE

1:27:48.760 --> 1:27:49.830
GAME.

1:27:49.890 --> 1:27:51.560
SO, I'M ASKING, WAS THERE EVER A

1:27:51.630 --> 1:27:52.530
MOMENT LIKE THAT FOR YOU?

1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:54.660
AND IF NOT, THAT'S COOL, TOO.

1:27:54.730 --> 1:27:55.830
>> YEAH, YEAH, SO DURING THE

1:27:55.900 --> 1:27:56.530
TIFFANY VOTE, I WAS FED

1:27:56.600 --> 1:28:00.040
DIFFERENT STORIES.

1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:00.600
SUDDENLY, IT WAS HEATHER.

1:28:00.670 --> 1:28:01.840
SUDDENLY, IT WAS NASEER.

1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:04.540
AND SO, THAT'S HOW I WAS ABLE TO

1:28:04.610 --> 1:28:06.140
FIGURE OUT I WAS LIKELY GETTING

1:28:06.210 --> 1:28:07.340
DUPED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO

1:28:07.410 --> 1:28:07.940
PLAY MY IDOL.

1:28:08.010 --> 1:28:08.440
>> SO, YOU WERE-- YOU WERE

1:28:08.510 --> 1:28:08.850
READING THE ROOM?

1:28:08.910 --> 1:28:09.680
>> YES.

1:28:09.750 --> 1:28:10.710
>> THANK YOU.

1:28:10.780 --> 1:28:12.080
>> YEAH, YEAH.

1:28:12.150 --> 1:28:12.750
>> A QUESTION RELATED TO THAT.

1:28:12.820 --> 1:28:13.820
AN AMAZING THING FOR YOUR GAME

1:28:13.880 --> 1:28:15.250
WAS THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO HOLD

1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:15.990
ONTO THAT IDOL EVEN THOUGH

1:28:16.050 --> 1:28:16.590
EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT IT POST-

1:28:16.650 --> 1:28:18.350
MERGE.

1:28:18.420 --> 1:28:19.690
WAS THAT, YOU KNOW, LUCK?

1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:20.360
OR WAS THAT YOUR SOCIAL GAME WAS

1:28:20.420 --> 1:28:23.030
GOOD ENOUGH THAT YOU ACTUALLY

1:28:23.090 --> 1:28:24.560
KNEW FROM PEOPLE THAT YOU DIDN'T

1:28:24.630 --> 1:28:25.360
NEED TO PLAY IT EACH TIME?

1:28:25.430 --> 1:28:25.960
>> I THINK IT WAS A MIXTURE OF

1:28:26.030 --> 1:28:27.260
BOTH.

1:28:27.330 --> 1:28:28.530
I WANTED TO PLAY THIS GAME A

1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:29.900
LITTLE PARANOID BECAUSE THE

1:28:29.970 --> 1:28:31.370
PARANOID PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS

1:28:31.430 --> 1:28:31.970
THINKING OF EVERY OPTION.

1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:33.770
SO, WHEN I WENT INTO EVERY

1:28:33.840 --> 1:28:35.040
TRIBAL COUNCIL, I WAS NERVOUS AS

1:28:35.100 --> 1:28:35.870
HELL, YOU KNOW.

1:28:35.940 --> 1:28:36.540
DO I PLAY IT?

1:28:36.610 --> 1:28:37.840
DO I<i> NOT</i> PLAY IT?

1:28:37.910 --> 1:28:40.680
WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO THE POINT

1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:43.310
WHEREWHEN HE SAID, "PLAY YOUR

1:28:43.380 --> 1:28:43.950
IDOL," HE MEANT THAT PEOPLE WERE

1:28:44.010 --> 1:28:45.950
VOTING FOR ME.

1:28:46.020 --> 1:28:47.920
BUT I KNEW THAT WITH THE CHAOS

1:28:47.980 --> 1:28:48.550
OF TRIBAL, PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE

1:28:48.620 --> 1:28:49.850
THE UNITY TO TAKE ME OUT.

1:28:49.920 --> 1:28:52.560
SO, A MIX OF BOTH.

1:28:52.620 --> 1:28:55.860
>> XANDER, WE HAD A<i> REALLY</i> SOLID

1:28:55.930 --> 1:29:00.230
I'VE NEVER HAD THIS, LIKE,

1:29:00.300 --> 1:29:00.900
BROMANCE WHERE I WAS LIKE, "OH,

1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:01.860
MY GOD, THIS IS UNCLE XANDER!

1:29:01.930 --> 1:29:02.700
HE'S GOING TO BE MEETING MY

1:29:02.770 --> 1:29:03.430
DAUGHTER.

1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:04.530
THIS IS AMAZING."

1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:07.840
LIKE, WE WERE<i> TIGHT.</i>

1:29:07.900 --> 1:29:12.540
IDEA OF VOTING ME OUT IN A

1:29:12.610 --> 1:29:14.810
STRATEGIC LIGHT, BUT WHAT

1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:15.810
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME IS,

1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:16.580
YOU TAKE OUT THE NUMBER ONE

1:29:16.650 --> 1:29:19.280
THREAT, ME, BUT THE NUMBER TWO

1:29:19.350 --> 1:29:19.880
THREAT, ERIKA, IS HERE.

1:29:19.950 --> 1:29:22.150
AND I KNOW, AT SOME POINT,

1:29:22.220 --> 1:29:23.750
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ASK YOU

1:29:23.820 --> 1:29:24.550
ABOUT THE FIRE-MAKING DECISION

1:29:24.620 --> 1:29:28.020
BECAUSE IT'S ALL-- IT'S CRAZY.

1:29:28.090 --> 1:29:28.560
I'M NOT GETTING INTO THAT,

1:29:28.620 --> 1:29:30.330
NECESSARILY.

1:29:30.390 --> 1:29:31.590
I'M JUST CONFUSED.

1:29:31.660 --> 1:29:32.430
WERE YOU ALWAYS LYING TO ME?

1:29:32.500 --> 1:29:34.700
WAS THAT A<i> FAKE</i> RELATIONSHIP?

1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:36.770
THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T GO

1:29:36.830 --> 1:29:37.870
TOGETHER.

1:29:37.930 --> 1:29:39.570
>> OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS

1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:40.540
COMPLETELY REAL.

1:29:40.600 --> 1:29:42.470
LIKE, I LOVE PEOPLE, AND I LOVE

1:29:42.540 --> 1:29:43.510
TO MAKE THESE CONNECTIONS.

1:29:43.570 --> 1:29:44.170
AND OUR CONNECTION<i> WAS</i>

1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:46.840
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE WON AGAINST

1:29:46.910 --> 1:29:48.540
ANYONE, AND...

1:29:48.610 --> 1:29:51.250
>> SO, WHY DID YOU KEEP HER?

1:29:51.310 --> 1:29:52.550
>> I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

1:29:52.620 --> 1:29:54.450
THAT ERIKA<i> WASN'T</i> THE BIGGEST

1:29:54.520 --> 1:29:56.550
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT DESHAWN

1:29:56.620 --> 1:29:59.660
SAID DURING HIS TRUTH BOMB, AND

1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:00.560
I FELT LIKE THE JURY REACTED

1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:01.860
POSITIVELY TO IT.

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.530
AND THAT COULD BE A FALLACY IN

1:30:04.590 --> 1:30:06.860
MY GAME, SO I-- I'M WILLING TO

1:30:06.930 --> 1:30:07.860
ADMIT THAT.

1:30:07.930 --> 1:30:08.530
>> I-- I WOULD INTERJECT.

1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:11.570
I SAID TO XANDER ON THE LAST

1:30:11.630 --> 1:30:12.540
DAY, "THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S

1:30:12.600 --> 1:30:13.240
LEFT HERE THAT COULD POSSIBLY

1:30:13.300 --> 1:30:16.570
TAKE YOUR GAME AWAY FROM YOU IS

1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:19.610
MY FRIEND ERIKA," AND YOU CHOSE

1:30:19.680 --> 1:30:20.310
TO TAKE HER WITH YOU.

1:30:20.380 --> 1:30:24.180
EXPLAIN WHY THIS WAS BENEFITING

1:30:24.250 --> 1:30:24.880
<i>YOUR</i> GAME, TAKING HER BESIDE

1:30:24.950 --> 1:30:28.050
>> I AGREE WITH YOU IN THE SENSE

1:30:28.120 --> 1:30:28.650
THAT SHE'S SOMEONE WHO'S VERY

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:31.250
STRATEGIC, BUT I FEEL LIKE

1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:31.950
I'VE GOT AN EDGE ON HER BECAUSE

1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:34.890
I'VE HAD A MORE WHOLESALE GAME.

1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.560
SO, I DIDN'T GIVE HER THE

1:30:36.630 --> 1:30:37.860
OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT SOMEONE IN

1:30:37.930 --> 1:30:40.030
FIRE BECAUSE IF SHE BEAT SOMEONE

1:30:40.100 --> 1:30:40.730
IN FIRE, I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE

1:30:40.800 --> 1:30:43.170
TIPPED THE BALANCE IN HER FAVOR.

1:30:43.230 --> 1:30:43.800
SO, I DIDN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

1:30:43.870 --> 1:30:44.100
>> OKAY.

1:30:44.170 --> 1:30:46.500
>> HMM.

1:30:46.570 --> 1:30:47.400
>> THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.

1:30:47.470 --> 1:30:48.270
>> SO, MY QUESTION'S FOR YOU,

1:30:48.340 --> 1:30:48.570
DESHAWN.

1:30:48.640 --> 1:30:49.870
>> YEAH.

1:30:49.940 --> 1:30:51.810
>> I FELT LIKE YOU LISTED A FEW

1:30:51.870 --> 1:30:52.540
DIFFERENT MOVES WHICH SOUND LIKE

1:30:52.610 --> 1:30:53.640
IT'S STRATEGIC...

1:30:53.710 --> 1:30:55.110
>> YEAH.

1:30:55.180 --> 1:30:55.880
>> ...BUT IT FELT MORE LIKE

1:30:55.950 --> 1:30:56.550
TEMPER TANTRUMS.

1:30:56.610 --> 1:30:57.410
>> HMM.

1:30:57.480 --> 1:30:57.980
>> LIKE, THERE WAS A LOT OF

1:30:58.050 --> 1:30:59.250
EMOTION INVOLVED.

1:30:59.320 --> 1:30:59.880
>> MM-HMM.

1:30:59.950 --> 1:31:00.450
>> AND EMOTION IS NOT A BAD

1:31:00.520 --> 1:31:00.780
THING AT ALL.

1:31:00.850 --> 1:31:01.420
>> YEAH.

1:31:01.480 --> 1:31:01.880
>> IT'S VERY POWERFUL.

1:31:01.950 --> 1:31:03.850
>> YEAH.

1:31:03.920 --> 1:31:04.550
>> BUT IF I LOOK AT EVERY TURN

1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:06.590
WHERE YOU HAD AN EMOTIONAL

1:31:06.660 --> 1:31:07.720
BREAKDOWN, I HAD TO COME TO YOU

1:31:07.790 --> 1:31:08.360
AND, LIKE, FIGURE OUT HOW I

1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:10.460
COULD TALK TO YOU BECAUSE I

1:31:10.530 --> 1:31:12.130
WANTED THIS FOUR-WAY ALLIANCE,

1:31:12.200 --> 1:31:12.830
YOU KNOW, TO WORK WITH,

1:31:12.900 --> 1:31:14.930
YOU KNOW, MYSELF, YOU AND LIANA

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:15.930
AND DANIEL.

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:16.600
>> YEAH.

1:31:16.670 --> 1:31:18.300
>> AND, AT EVERY TURN WHERE WE

1:31:18.370 --> 1:31:19.500
HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS, YOU RE-

1:31:19.570 --> 1:31:20.100
LOCKED US IN WITH THIS SOCIAL

1:31:20.170 --> 1:31:20.670
MOVEMENT THAT WAS REALLY

1:31:20.740 --> 1:31:22.310
IMPORTANT TO US, THAT'S

1:31:22.370 --> 1:31:23.540
HAPPENING IN THE REAL WORLD.

1:31:23.610 --> 1:31:24.440
AND WE WERE ALL WANTING TO BRING

1:31:24.510 --> 1:31:24.940
HOME A WIN FOR THE BLACK

1:31:25.010 --> 1:31:25.880
COMMUNITY, RIGHT?

1:31:25.940 --> 1:31:27.410
>> YEAH.

1:31:27.480 --> 1:31:28.540
>> AND I FELT LIKE THAT HIJACKED

1:31:28.610 --> 1:31:30.410
ME EMOTIONALLY A LOT OF THE

1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:31.610
TIMES BECAUSE I WAS<i> REALLY</i>

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:32.780
WHERE I WAS GOING TO PUT MY

1:31:32.850 --> 1:31:33.850
GAME.

1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:35.320
I WOULD HAVE COME IN FOURTH FOR

1:31:35.380 --> 1:31:36.420
ALL THREE OF YOU TO TAKE ONE,

1:31:36.490 --> 1:31:37.120
TWO, AND THREE, YOU KNOW.

1:31:37.190 --> 1:31:37.890
AND I SAID THAT TO YOU TIME AND

1:31:37.950 --> 1:31:39.460
TIME AGAIN.

1:31:39.520 --> 1:31:40.190
>> MM-HMM.

1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:40.820
>> IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MY

1:31:40.890 --> 1:31:42.790
VOTE TONIGHT TO KNOW WHAT

1:31:42.860 --> 1:31:43.890
HAPPENED.

1:31:43.960 --> 1:31:46.430
WERE YOU CAPITALIZING ON A

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:47.960
SOCIAL MOVEMENT BACK HOME AND

1:31:48.030 --> 1:31:48.630
USING THAT TO HIJACK ME AND

1:31:48.700 --> 1:31:49.900
MAYBE THE OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR

1:31:49.970 --> 1:31:50.600
ALLIANCE?

1:31:50.670 --> 1:31:52.740
OR WERE YOU SERIOUS ABOUT THAT?

1:31:52.800 --> 1:31:55.100
BECAUSE THAT FEELS LIKE, TO ME,

1:31:55.170 --> 1:31:55.810
OUT OF BOUNDS.

1:31:55.870 --> 1:31:58.140
>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT VERY,

1:31:58.210 --> 1:31:59.640
VERY CLEAR RIGHT NOW: I DON'T

1:31:59.710 --> 1:32:00.340
EVEN CARE ABOUT HOW THIS-- GIVE

1:32:00.410 --> 1:32:01.680
ME THIRD.

1:32:01.740 --> 1:32:04.350
I WOULD NEVER, EVER SELL OUT MY

1:32:04.410 --> 1:32:06.050
PEOPLE FOR A GAME.

1:32:06.120 --> 1:32:07.520
THAT WAS NEVER MY INTENTIONS,

1:32:07.580 --> 1:32:08.150
<i>EVER.</i>

1:32:08.220 --> 1:32:11.150
POINT OF, YOU KNOW, WERE THE

1:32:11.220 --> 1:32:12.090
MOVES THAT HAPPENED AT TRIBAL

1:32:12.150 --> 1:32:12.560
EMOTIONAL?

1:32:12.620 --> 1:32:13.690
>> NOT EMOTIONAL.

1:32:13.760 --> 1:32:15.360
NOT EMOTIONAL.

1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:16.230
TEMPER TANTRUMS, SULKING, AND

1:32:16.290 --> 1:32:16.790
POUTING, YEAH.

1:32:16.860 --> 1:32:18.430
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

1:32:18.490 --> 1:32:19.560
YEAH, SO I HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT

1:32:19.630 --> 1:32:20.200
THAT'S THE WAY IT WAS PERCEIVED,

1:32:20.260 --> 1:32:20.730
BUT I WORE MY HEART ON MY

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:22.470
SLEEVE.

1:32:22.530 --> 1:32:23.130
AND SO, IF I FELT LIKE PEOPLE

1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:24.230
WEREN'T LISTENING, THAT'S THE

1:32:24.300 --> 1:32:24.630
WAY I RESPONDED.

1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:25.530
AND I'M YOUNG.

1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:26.170
I HAVE TO ADMIT, I HAVE A LOT TO

1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:27.440
LEARN.

1:32:27.500 --> 1:32:28.340
SO, THAT'S JUST THAT.

1:32:28.400 --> 1:32:29.940
IT DOES HURT MY HEART A LITTLE

1:32:30.010 --> 1:32:31.240
BIT THAT IT WOULD EVEN BE

1:32:31.310 --> 1:32:31.910
CONSIDERED THAT I WILL USE A

1:32:31.970 --> 1:32:34.540
SOCIAL MOVEMENT IN THIS GAME,

1:32:34.610 --> 1:32:35.950
BUT I UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR

1:32:36.010 --> 1:32:36.610
VANTAGE POINT HOW YOU FEEL.

1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:38.810
YOU AND I HAVE A VERY PERSONAL

1:32:38.880 --> 1:32:39.980
RELATIONSHIP.

1:32:40.050 --> 1:32:40.550
I THINK OF YOU AS MY SISTER.

1:32:40.620 --> 1:32:41.550
AND THAT'S WHY I WAS SO

1:32:41.620 --> 1:32:43.690
EMOTIONAL AT TRIBAL COUNCIL.

1:32:43.750 --> 1:32:44.390
LIKE, I WAS<i> HURTING</i> SHAN.

1:32:44.450 --> 1:32:47.460
TRIBAL COUNCILS HAVE TO VOTE YOU

1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:48.360
OUT, AND ALL I CAN DO IS

1:32:48.420 --> 1:32:49.690
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

1:32:49.760 --> 1:32:51.090
IT-- IT IS SOMETHING I HAVE TO

1:32:51.160 --> 1:32:52.360
BEAR THE WEIGHT OF.

1:32:52.430 --> 1:32:55.700
LIKE, I FEEL-- I WOULD NEVER

1:32:55.770 --> 1:32:56.330
HAVE DONE THAT.

1:32:56.400 --> 1:32:58.030
IT WAS HARD, SHAN, SO I'M

1:32:58.100 --> 1:32:58.800
SORRY.

1:32:58.870 --> 1:33:00.340
>> RIGHT, IT'S ALL FORGIVEN, FOR

1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:01.670
SURE.

1:33:01.740 --> 1:33:03.870
AND I-- I'M SUPER PROUD OF YOU

1:33:03.940 --> 1:33:04.570
FOR SITTING THERE TONIGHT, AND I

1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:05.640
THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE

1:33:05.710 --> 1:33:06.480
TONS OF PEOPLE PROUD.

1:33:06.540 --> 1:33:07.240
SO...

1:33:07.310 --> 1:33:07.910
>> THANK YOU.

1:33:07.980 --> 1:33:08.240
>> ...CONGRATULATIONS ON FINAL

1:33:08.310 --> 1:33:10.050
THREE.

1:33:10.110 --> 1:33:11.710
>> THANK YOU.

1:33:11.780 --> 1:33:14.380
>> Probst: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

1:33:14.450 --> 1:33:15.420
>> YEAH.

1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:16.120
SO, I REALLY JUST WANTED TO TAKE

1:33:16.190 --> 1:33:17.720
A CHANCE TO ADDRESS ERIKA FOR A

1:33:17.790 --> 1:33:18.650
SECOND.

1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:19.360
FROM A COMPETITOR, AND

1:33:19.420 --> 1:33:20.620
COMPETITIVELY SPEAKING, I THINK

1:33:20.690 --> 1:33:24.290
YOU DID ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IN

1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:24.930
THE INDIVIDUAL IMMUNITY

1:33:24.990 --> 1:33:28.230
CHALLENGES AND THE PUZZLES.

1:33:28.300 --> 1:33:28.860
AND INTENTIONALLY OR

1:33:28.930 --> 1:33:31.970
UNINTENTIONALLY, YOU ALLOWED

1:33:32.030 --> 1:33:32.600
PEOPLE TO UNDERESTIMATE YOU AND

1:33:32.670 --> 1:33:34.600
NOT SEE WHAT YOU WERE REALLY

1:33:34.670 --> 1:33:35.710
CAPABLE OF DOING.

1:33:35.770 --> 1:33:36.610
>> DANNY!

1:33:36.670 --> 1:33:37.970
COMING THROUGH!

1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:39.580
I MEAN, THE REALITY IS, I'VE

1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:40.610
SPENT, LIKE, ALMOST TEN YEARS,

1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:42.910
LIKE, GOING INTO BOARDROOMS;

1:33:42.980 --> 1:33:43.850
PEOPLE TREAT ME LIKE THE INTERN,

1:33:43.910 --> 1:33:44.410
BUT I'M REALLY THE ONE WHO'S

1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:47.550
RUNNING THE MEETING.

1:33:47.620 --> 1:33:48.180
AGAIN, I WAS NEVER OUT IN FRONT,

1:33:48.250 --> 1:33:48.750
BUT I WAS NEVER QUITE AT THE

1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:49.990
BOTTOM.

1:33:50.050 --> 1:33:52.150
AND AT EVERY TRIBAL COUNCIL I

1:33:52.220 --> 1:33:52.790
WENT TO, I WAS ON THE RIGHT SIDE

1:33:52.860 --> 1:33:54.860
OF THE VOTE.

1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:55.990
SO, I WASN'T SURE WHAT THE PATH

1:33:56.060 --> 1:33:56.630
FOR ME WAS GOING TO BE<i> TO</i> THE

1:33:56.690 --> 1:34:00.600
KNEW IF I GOT THERE I'D BE A

1:34:00.660 --> 1:34:01.900
DARK HORSE.

1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:02.600
>> AND I-- I SAY THAT BECAUSE I

1:34:02.670 --> 1:34:04.600
ENVY YOU BECAUSE YOU PLAYED THE

1:34:04.670 --> 1:34:07.240
GAME THAT I REALLY WANTED TO

1:34:07.300 --> 1:34:07.970
PLAY AND-- AND TRIED TO.

1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:08.600
SO, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU.

1:34:08.670 --> 1:34:11.270

1:34:11.340 --> 1:34:12.610
>> ME, TOO.

1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:13.980
>> XANDER, I HAVE ONE QUESTION

1:34:14.040 --> 1:34:16.650
FOR YOU: DO YOU HAVE AN IDOL?

1:34:16.710 --> 1:34:24.590
(<i> LAUGHTER</i> )

1:34:24.650 --> 1:34:25.820
>> YEAH, REALLY.

1:34:25.890 --> 1:34:26.460
>> GOOD JOB!

1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:27.420
>> EVERYONE DID A GOOD JOB.

1:34:27.490 --> 1:34:28.620
>> VERY TOUGH DECISION.

1:34:28.690 --> 1:34:29.930
(<i> APPLAUSE</i> )

1:34:29.990 --> 1:34:31.990
NICE JOB.

1:34:32.060 --> 1:34:34.200
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A MINUTE

1:34:34.260 --> 1:34:36.430
NOW TO THINK ABOUT YOUR VOTE.

1:34:36.500 --> 1:34:37.030
AND WHEN WE COME BACK FOR THE

1:34:37.100 --> 1:34:38.430
LAST TIME, WE WILL VOTE.

INTENSE-- INTENSE DAYS OF GAME

1:34:55.150 --> 1:34:58.090

1:35:12.030 --> 1:35:26.920
TIFFANY, YOU'RE UP.

1:35:26.980 --> 1:35:28.650
TIFFANY, YOU'RE UP.

1:35:31.050 --> 1:35:45.940
YOU DID IT.

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:50.140
YOU DID IT.

1:35:50.210 --> 1:35:51.710
>> YOUR GAME WAS MORE

1:35:51.770 --> 1:35:54.240
INTENTIONAL, MORE RISK-TAKING,

1:35:54.310 --> 1:36:08.960
AND GOOD LUCK.

1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:19.000

>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S OVER.

1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:31.010
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, THE THEME OF

1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:35.820
THIS SEASON REALLY DID

1:36:35.890 --> 1:36:36.990
BECOME-- FIRST TIME WE EVER

1:36:37.050 --> 1:36:38.890
PLAYED 26 DAYS FORCED A

1:36:38.950 --> 1:36:40.420
RELENTLESS PACE AND ALSO WE

1:36:40.490 --> 1:36:42.730
INTRODUCED THE MOST DANGEROUS

1:36:42.790 --> 1:36:47.930
TWIST WE HAVE EVER DONE.

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:49.400
SO A LITTLE HISTORY CHECK, THE

1:36:49.470 --> 1:36:50.800
ONLY TIME WE HAVE EVER DONE THIS

1:36:50.870 --> 1:36:52.230
WAS THE LAST TIME WE DID IT

1:36:52.300 --> 1:36:57.470
WHICH WAS THE THE SUMMER OF 2

1:36:57.540 --> 1:36:58.110
THOUSAND WHEN-- 2000 WHEN WE

1:36:58.170 --> 1:37:00.740

1:37:00.810 --> 1:37:03.450
RICHARD HATCH AS THE FIRST

1:37:03.510 --> 1:37:05.150
WINNER, I THINK IT ST TIME TO DO

1:37:05.210 --> 1:37:10.750
IT AGAIN 21 YEARS LATER.

1:37:10.820 --> 1:37:13.020
WE ARE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE

1:37:13.090 --> 1:37:15.120
WINNER OF SURVIVOR 41 RIGHT NOW.

ARE YOU READY?

1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:18.630
I'M NOT JOKING.

1:37:18.690 --> 1:37:18.930
>> WOW.

1:37:18.990 --> 1:37:19.600

CONGRATULATIONS.

1:38:15.320 --> 1:38:16.420
I'M GOOD FOR THE MONEY, BUT

1:38:16.490 --> 1:38:18.520
LOOK, THIS IS AN AWKWARD MOMENT,

1:38:18.590 --> 1:38:19.320
ISN'T IT.

1:38:19.390 --> 1:38:20.020
>> YEAH.

1:38:20.090 --> 1:38:21.120
>> LIKE WE'RE RIGHT HERE, THERE

1:38:21.190 --> 1:38:23.190
ARE USUALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

1:38:23.260 --> 1:38:23.760
YELLING.

1:38:23.830 --> 1:38:24.890
LET'S MAKE A LITTLE MORE

1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:25.690
HISTORY.

1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:28.330
LET'S DO SOMETHING WE'VE NEVER

1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:30.330
DONE BEFORE, LET'S KEEP

1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:31.030
SHOOTING.

1:38:31.100 --> 1:38:31.770
LET'S BRING IT IN.

1:38:31.830 --> 1:38:33.500
LET'S BRING IN SOME-- LET'S

1:38:33.570 --> 1:38:35.200
BRING IN OUR CAMPAIGN, WE'LL DO

1:38:35.270 --> 1:38:36.910
SOMETHING WE HAVE NEVER DONE

1:38:36.970 --> 1:38:37.570
BEFORE, WE ARE GOING TO CALL IT

1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:40.510
IT THE SURVIVOR AFTERSHOW AND

1:38:40.580 --> 1:38:42.140
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW

1:38:42.210 --> 1:38:43.810
HERE IN THE MOST RAW WAY

1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:44.510
POSSIBLE.

1:38:44.580 --> 1:38:46.920
LET'S MOVE THE CAMERA OPERATORS,

1:38:46.980 --> 1:38:50.390
READJUST SOME OF THE THINGS

1:38:50.450 --> 1:38:52.890
INCLUDING YOU COMING OVER AND

1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:54.220
CONGRATULATING THE THREE YOU PUT

1:38:54.290 --> 1:38:54.990
THROUGH THE GRILL.

1:38:55.060 --> 1:38:56.790
I HAVE WANTED TO DO THIS FROM

1:38:56.860 --> 1:38:57.730
ALMOST THE BEGINNING.

1:38:57.790 --> 1:39:01.100
BECAUSE THIS IS AS ABOUT AS RAW

1:39:01.160 --> 1:39:03.130
AS YOU CAN GET, LET'S LIGHT UP

1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:04.670
THE TORCHES, WE WILL BE HERE FOR

1:39:04.730 --> 1:39:05.170
AWHILE.

1:39:05.230 --> 1:39:05.870
MOVE A FEW CAMERAS.

1:39:05.930 --> 1:39:07.270
THINK OF IT TASK THE LAST NIGHT

1:39:07.340 --> 1:39:11.010
OF SURVIVOR SUMMER CAMP, IT IS

1:39:11.070 --> 1:39:13.680
THE SURVIVOR 41 AFTERSHOW, GIVE

1:39:13.740 --> 1:39:15.440
US TWO MINUTES AND WE'LL BE

1:39:15.510 --> 1:39:16.280
RIGHT BACK.

1:39:16.350 --> 1:39:18.010
LET ME GET SOME CHAMPAGNE.

1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:31.960
>> ALL RIGHT, SO WE'VE NEVER

1:39:32.030 --> 1:39:33.100
DONE THIS BEFORE.

1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:34.400
THE CHAMPAGNE IS REAL, ANY TIME

1:39:34.460 --> 1:39:36.330
YOU NEED MORE PIZZA YOU LET ME

1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:37.100
KNOW.

1:39:37.170 --> 1:39:38.930
THIS IS THE, WHAT WOULD NORMALLY

1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:40.600
BE THE REUNION SHOW.

1:39:40.670 --> 1:39:42.540
BECAUSE AS MUCH FUN AS IT IS TO

1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:44.540
IT BE BACK IN LOS ANGELES AND

1:39:44.610 --> 1:39:47.180
THE LIGHTS AND BIG CROWD AND

1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:48.880
YOUR FAMILY AND ALL THAT HOOPLA,

1:39:48.940 --> 1:39:52.950
WHAT IT MISSES IS THE IMMEDIATE

1:39:53.020 --> 1:39:54.480
SEE AND THE TRUTH.

1:39:54.550 --> 1:39:56.420
SO LET'S JUST TALK, AND IF YOU

1:39:56.490 --> 1:39:58.220
WANT SOMETHING ELSE TO DRINK, WE

1:39:58.290 --> 1:39:59.590
HAVE A TEAM OVER HERE TO BRING

1:39:59.660 --> 1:40:02.420
IT TO YOU, AND SOME CHAMPAGNE.

1:40:02.490 --> 1:40:03.890
>> WHILE WE ARE DOING THIS,

1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:05.430
ERIKA, I WANT TO START WITH YOU,

1:40:05.490 --> 1:40:07.330
WHATEVER YOU NEED YOU JUST ASK,

1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:08.860
WE'LL GET IT.

1:40:08.930 --> 1:40:09.500
THERE WAS AN INTERESTING THEME

1:40:09.570 --> 1:40:10.800
THAT IN YOUR CAREER THAT YOU

1:40:10.870 --> 1:40:12.400
WOULD GO INTO A ROOM AND NOBODY

1:40:12.470 --> 1:40:13.400
WOULD EVER GUESS THAT YOU WERE

1:40:13.470 --> 1:40:14.940
THE ONE IN CHARGE.

1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:15.570
>> YEAH.

1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:17.140
>> THAT BECOMES A SKILL IN A

1:40:17.210 --> 1:40:18.470
GAME LIKE SURVIVOR.

1:40:18.540 --> 1:40:19.410
WHERE YOU WERE ABLE EVEN WITH

1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:21.410
YOUR EGO TO SAY I DON'T HAVE TO

1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:22.610
HAVE THEM THINK I AM IN CHARGE.

1:40:22.680 --> 1:40:24.910
I JUST NEED A PATH TO IT THE

1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:25.580
END.

1:40:25.650 --> 1:40:26.680
HOW MUCH OF THAT GOING IN WAS

1:40:26.750 --> 1:40:27.520
SOMETHING YOU KNEW YOU COULD

1:40:27.580 --> 1:40:29.150
COUNT ON?

1:40:29.220 --> 1:40:31.450
>> THE WAY THAT I LEFT REALLY

1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:32.650
AFFECTS THE WAY PEOPLE TREAT

1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:33.490
MEOWS OF THE GAME, WHENEVER I GO

1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:35.220
TO THE AIRPORT BY MYSELF EVEN

1:40:35.290 --> 1:40:36.790
THOUGH I AM A FREQUENT TRAVELER

1:40:36.860 --> 1:40:38.960
PEOPLE ASK ME IF I AM AN

1:40:39.030 --> 1:40:39.630
UNACCOMPANIED MINE ERR AND HAVE

1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:42.870
I TO GO THROUGH ALL THE EXTRA

1:40:42.930 --> 1:40:43.530
STEPS BECAUSE I'M A KID.

1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:44.730
SO I KNEW THAT WAS SOMETHING

1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:46.000
THAT I HAD UP MY SLEEVE.

1:40:46.070 --> 1:40:47.900
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT

1:40:47.970 --> 1:40:49.440
YEAH, I HAD NO EGO ABOUT HOW I

1:40:49.510 --> 1:40:50.310
WOULD PLAY IT.

1:40:50.370 --> 1:40:52.010
I KNEW THAT IT MADE MORE SENSE

1:40:52.070 --> 1:40:53.280
FOR HEATHER TO TALK TO SOMEONE,

1:40:53.340 --> 1:40:54.080
SHE COULD DO IT.

1:40:54.140 --> 1:40:56.580
I DON'T NEED TO HAVE THE FULL

1:40:56.650 --> 1:40:57.280
CREDIT FOR ANYTHING.

1:40:57.350 --> 1:40:59.280
AND I KNEW THAT THE PATH TO THE

1:40:59.350 --> 1:41:01.420
END, IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE

1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:02.080
PRETTY.

1:41:02.150 --> 1:41:02.790
I THINK TIFFANY MIGHT TALK TO

1:41:02.850 --> 1:41:04.090
THAT, IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE

1:41:04.150 --> 1:41:05.550
PRETTY, I JUST HAD TO GET HERE,

1:41:05.620 --> 1:41:07.260
I DIDN'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THE

1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:09.290
ONE IN CHARGE, I JUST NEEDED THE

1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:10.290
CHANCE TO PROVE MY CASE.

1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:11.430
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DON'T

1:41:11.490 --> 1:41:13.460
KNOW IS THAT I VISITED YOU WHEN

1:41:13.530 --> 1:41:15.460
YOU WERE OUT ALONE ON THAT

1:41:15.530 --> 1:41:16.400
ISLAND, I WAS THE ONE THAT

1:41:16.470 --> 1:41:17.800
DELIVERED THE TWIST THAT DANNY

1:41:17.870 --> 1:41:18.700
ADORED SO MUCH.

1:41:18.770 --> 1:41:20.970
AND I GOT TO SAY, WHEN I SAW YOU

1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:23.540
OUT THERE, I ASKED YOU HOW IT

1:41:23.610 --> 1:41:24.240
WAS.

1:41:24.310 --> 1:41:26.340
AND YOU SAID YOU KNOW, THE FIRST

1:41:26.410 --> 1:41:28.940
TIME WAS KIND OF TOUGH, I WAS

1:41:29.010 --> 1:41:30.950
ALONE, IT'S WET, HARD TO LIVE ON

1:41:31.010 --> 1:41:32.980
AN ISLAND, BUT I SEPTEMBER

1:41:33.050 --> 1:41:35.250
STRIKING THE FLINT AND KEPT

1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:36.750
SAYING I AM GOING TO GET FIRE,

1:41:36.820 --> 1:41:38.990
WHAT I SAW WHEN I SAW YOU WAS A

1:41:39.050 --> 1:41:40.660
DIFFERENT PERSON THAN THE FIRST

1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:41.360
HALF OF THE GAME.

1:41:41.420 --> 1:41:43.560
YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU BELONGED ON

1:41:43.630 --> 1:41:44.630
THAT ISLAND.

1:41:44.690 --> 1:41:45.860
>> OH, 100 PERCENT.

1:41:45.930 --> 1:41:48.660
LIKE BEING ON EKES IL-- EXILE

1:41:48.730 --> 1:41:49.630
FELT LIKE THE TURNING POINT OF

1:41:49.700 --> 1:41:52.070
MY GAME, TWO DAYS BEFORE I WAS

1:41:52.130 --> 1:41:54.100
ON EXILE I HAD A BREAKDOWN, I

1:41:54.170 --> 1:41:55.840
WAS ON THE WINNING SHALL LOSING

1:41:55.900 --> 1:41:56.970
SIDE YOU WOULD THINK EVERYTHING

1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:58.810
WAS GREAT AND I WAS CRYING AND

1:41:58.870 --> 1:42:00.840
THINKING HOW WILL I WIN THIS

1:42:00.910 --> 1:42:01.980
GAME, I HAVEN'T HAD TO VOTE FOR

1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:03.980
ANYONE, HOW WILL I HAVE THE CRED

1:42:04.050 --> 1:42:04.880
AT THE END OF THE GAME.

1:42:04.950 --> 1:42:06.980
AND THEN WHEN I HAD TO FACE MY

1:42:07.050 --> 1:42:08.250
GREATEST FEAR, ONE NIGHT ALONE

1:42:08.320 --> 1:42:10.090
ON EXILE AND REALIZING THAT I

1:42:10.150 --> 1:42:11.550
COULD DO IT, LIKE THE REST OF

1:42:11.620 --> 1:42:13.520
THE GAME WAS TOTALLY POSSIBLE.

1:42:13.590 --> 1:42:14.960
AND I WAS LOOKING AT MY FIRE

1:42:15.020 --> 1:42:17.190
THAT TOOK ME NEARLY TWO HOURS TO

1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:19.530
BUILT, SO MAYBE XANDER SHOULD

1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:20.960
HAVE SET ME A INTO FIERKS I

1:42:21.030 --> 1:42:22.970
DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE THAT

1:42:23.030 --> 1:42:24.730
MOMENT, I REALIZED IT WAS GOING

1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:26.740
TO BE HARD BUT AS LONG AS I KEEP

1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:27.700
GOING I KNOW I HAVE WHAT IT

1:42:27.770 --> 1:42:29.440
TAKES TO GET TO THE END.

1:42:29.510 --> 1:42:31.110
>> WELL DONE, CONGRATULATIONS.

1:42:31.170 --> 1:42:31.770
>> THANK YOU.

1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:33.480
>> TO OUR FIRST CANADA WINNER.

1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:34.480
>> TO ERIKA.

1:42:34.540 --> 1:42:35.410
>> TO ERIKA.

1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:36.710
>> THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY IN

1:42:36.780 --> 1:42:38.680
CANADA, SO THANK YOU.

1:42:38.750 --> 1:42:40.780
>> SO XANDER, I WANT TO TALK TO

1:42:40.850 --> 1:42:41.450
YOU.

1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:42.180
BECAUSE IT IS A VERY HARD GAME

1:42:42.250 --> 1:42:45.620
TO PLAY, YOU ARE VERY YOUNG TO

1:42:45.690 --> 1:42:46.620
GET HERE.

1:42:46.690 --> 1:42:47.320
THAT WAS THE THEME THE JURY,

1:42:47.390 --> 1:42:49.160
MOST OF WHOM ARE OLDER PICKED UP

1:42:49.220 --> 1:42:50.960
ON IS IF THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU

1:42:51.030 --> 1:42:53.600
WERE MISSING, IT WAS A SOCIAL

1:42:53.660 --> 1:42:54.630
AWARENESS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS

1:42:54.700 --> 1:42:56.160
HAPPENING IN THE GAME THAT YOU

1:42:56.230 --> 1:42:56.970
ARE NOT SEEING.

1:42:57.030 --> 1:42:58.230
SO WHEN YOU HEAR THAT, WHAT IS

1:42:58.300 --> 1:42:59.570
YOUR TAKE ON IT?

1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:02.100
>> YEAH, I MEAN HONESTLY, I'M

1:43:02.170 --> 1:43:04.440
VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE WHOLE

1:43:04.510 --> 1:43:04.970
EXPERIENCE.

1:43:05.040 --> 1:43:06.910
IT'S BEEN LIKE A TRIP.

1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:08.310
I DID EVERYTHING THAT I WANTED

1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:09.140
TO DO.

1:43:09.210 --> 1:43:10.650
I ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH.

1:43:10.710 --> 1:43:12.210
AND I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE

1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:13.720
SOMETHING THAT WAS EASY.

1:43:13.780 --> 1:43:15.180
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE-- IT

1:43:15.250 --> 1:43:16.320
WASN'T ABOUT THE WIN FOR ME.

1:43:16.390 --> 1:43:18.090
IT WAS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO COME

1:43:18.150 --> 1:43:20.320
OUT HERE AND STRUGGLE AND GET

1:43:20.390 --> 1:43:21.420
THIS EXPERIENCE.

1:43:21.490 --> 1:43:22.790
YEAH, I DID SO MANY THINGS.

1:43:22.860 --> 1:43:23.760
I MADE YOU LAUGH.

1:43:23.830 --> 1:43:24.890
I WON A CHALLENGE.

1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:26.260
I FOUND AN IDOL.

1:43:26.330 --> 1:43:28.630
A RISKED MY VOTE, I HAD AN EXTRA

1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:29.330
VOTE.

1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:30.600
I MADE IT TO THE FINAL THREE AND

1:43:30.670 --> 1:43:32.700
YEAH, I MEAN I'M SO PROUD.

1:43:32.770 --> 1:43:34.640
I THINK GOING IN THAT NO MATTER

1:43:34.700 --> 1:43:35.870
WHAT HAPPENED, I WOULD BE SO

1:43:35.940 --> 1:43:37.340
PROUD OF MYSELF.

1:43:37.410 --> 1:43:39.510
AND NOT GETTING ANY VOTES, AS

1:43:39.580 --> 1:43:41.380
MUCH AS I KNEW ERIKA WAS A

1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:43.410
THREAT, AND I WAS TRYING TO

1:43:43.480 --> 1:43:44.850
UNDERPLAY THAT, I DIDN'T SEE

1:43:44.910 --> 1:43:46.620
EXACTLY HOW MUCH PEOPLE

1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:48.580
RESPECTED HER GAME PLAY. SO

1:43:48.650 --> 1:43:49.790
THAT WAS COMPLETELY ON ME.

1:43:49.850 --> 1:43:51.750
AND NOW I GET TO TAKE THIS

1:43:51.820 --> 1:43:53.090
INFORMATION, I GET TO GROW FROM

1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:54.390
IT, AND LEARN.

1:43:54.460 --> 1:43:55.920
AND I LOVE THAT I'M NOT, YOU

1:43:55.990 --> 1:43:57.460
KNOW, A COMPLETE PERSON, THAT I

1:43:57.530 --> 1:44:00.260
DO HAVE MORE THINKS-- THINGS TO

1:44:00.330 --> 1:44:00.960
WORK ON.

1:44:01.030 --> 1:44:01.560
> AND WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT

1:44:01.630 --> 1:44:03.400
YOUR STORY IS YOU SAID SO

1:44:03.470 --> 1:44:05.230
CLEARLY, I WASN'T THE KID THAT

1:44:05.300 --> 1:44:06.300
WATCHED SURVIVOR AND DREAMED OF

1:44:06.370 --> 1:44:07.170
BEING ON.

1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:08.770
I WAS THE KID WHO LAMENTED I

1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:09.810
WOULD NEVER BE ON BECAUSE I

1:44:09.870 --> 1:44:12.010
DIDN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

1:44:12.070 --> 1:44:13.180
WHAT DID YOU LEARN THAT YOU CAN

1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:14.880
CONNECT BACK TO THAT LITTLE KID

1:44:14.940 --> 1:44:16.450
TO SAY I HAD IT ALL ALONG.

1:44:16.510 --> 1:44:18.250
>> I MEAN I WISH I COULD GO BACK

1:44:18.310 --> 1:44:20.320
AND TIME AND TELL HIM THAT THE

1:44:20.380 --> 1:44:21.750
ONLY LIMITS THAT EXIST IN THIS

1:44:21.820 --> 1:44:23.620
WORLD ARE THE LIMITS YOU PLACE

1:44:23.690 --> 1:44:24.250
ON YOURSELF.

1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:25.690
DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYBODY

1:44:25.750 --> 1:44:26.860
SAYS BECAUSE YOU CAN DO

1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:27.560
ANYTHING.

1:44:27.620 --> 1:44:29.690
JUST WANT IT, IF IT IS HARD AND

1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:31.230
YOU FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU WANT,

1:44:31.290 --> 1:44:33.000
THEN YOU CAN ACHIEVE IT.

1:44:33.060 --> 1:44:34.530
>> WELL, HUGE CONGRATULATIONS TO

1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:37.330
YOU TO GET THIS DEEP IN THE

1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:38.230
GAME.

1:44:38.300 --> 1:44:40.300
AND DESHAWN, THE STORY WITH YOU

1:44:40.370 --> 1:44:42.400
WAS BEING TEMPERMENTAL,

1:44:42.470 --> 1:44:43.570
EMOTIONAL, REACTION, WHATEVER

1:44:43.640 --> 1:44:46.170
YOU WANT TO CALL IT, SHAN,

1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:46.910
DANNY, A LOT OF PEOPLE BROUGHT

1:44:46.980 --> 1:44:47.440
IT UP.

1:44:47.510 --> 1:44:48.780
DID THAT SURPRISE YOU?

1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:51.510
>> I THINK IT DID SURPRISE ME.

1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:55.250
I THINK MAYBE I HAD A HUGE

1:44:55.320 --> 1:44:56.620
PERCEPTION OF MYSELF OUTSIDE OF

1:44:56.690 --> 1:44:58.650
THIS, MAYBE SURVIVOR BROUGHT OUT

1:44:58.720 --> 1:44:59.320
THAT.

1:44:59.390 --> 1:45:00.260
IN THE REAL WORLD I DIDN'T SEE

1:45:00.320 --> 1:45:00.890
MYSELF LIKE THAT.

1:45:00.960 --> 1:45:02.560
BUT THIS IS ALL DOCUMENTED.

1:45:02.620 --> 1:45:03.860
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN RECORDED.

1:45:03.930 --> 1:45:07.400
AND YOU KNOW, WHEN MULTIPLE

1:45:07.460 --> 1:45:08.060
PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU

1:45:08.130 --> 1:45:08.660
SOMETHING, THERE MUST BE TRUTH

1:45:08.730 --> 1:45:09.330
TO THAT.

1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:11.400
SO I AM REALLY EXCITED FOR AN

1:45:11.470 --> 1:45:13.170
OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT AND GROW

1:45:13.240 --> 1:45:13.840
FROM THIS EXPERIENCE.

1:45:13.900 --> 1:45:16.070
I THANK YOU YOU GUYS FOR BEING

1:45:16.140 --> 1:45:17.270
WILLING TO EDUCATE ME ON THE

1:45:17.340 --> 1:45:17.910
PERSON THAT I AM.

1:45:17.970 --> 1:45:19.710
AND IT IS JUST LIKE NO, YOU

1:45:19.780 --> 1:45:21.710
STILL GOT SOME ROOM TO GROW,

1:45:21.780 --> 1:45:22.340
MAN.

1:45:22.410 --> 1:45:23.950
SO I AM EXCITED TO DO THAT.

1:45:24.010 --> 1:45:24.650
>> AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR, I DID

1:45:24.710 --> 1:45:25.950
NOT GET THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY

1:45:26.010 --> 1:45:27.350
THOUGHT YOU WERE A DISASTER.

1:45:27.420 --> 1:45:29.720
IT WAS JUST ONE ELEMENT OF YOUR

1:45:29.790 --> 1:45:30.420
PERSONALITY.

1:45:30.490 --> 1:45:32.320
I FOUND YOU THIS ENTIRE TIME TO

1:45:32.390 --> 1:45:35.220
BE REALLY LIKABLE, FUNNY AND YOU

1:45:35.290 --> 1:45:38.260
MADE IT DEEP INTO THIS GAME.

1:45:38.330 --> 1:45:40.230
YOU GOT A VOTE, GETTING ANY

1:45:40.300 --> 1:45:41.660
VOTES IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

1:45:41.730 --> 1:45:44.630
AND FOR ME YOUR TURNING POINT

1:45:44.700 --> 1:45:46.370
SEEMED TO BE THE FIRE MAKING

1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:47.070
CHALLENGE.

1:45:47.140 --> 1:45:48.300
WHEN YOU WERE OUT OF IT, I MEAN

1:45:48.370 --> 1:45:50.570
HEATHER WAS SECONDS AWAY FROM

1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:51.070
WINNING.

1:45:51.140 --> 1:45:51.740
I WAS WATCHING YOU.

1:45:51.810 --> 1:45:53.140
YOU NEVER ONCE LOOKED OVER.

1:45:53.210 --> 1:45:54.910
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU EVER LOOKED

1:45:54.980 --> 1:45:55.880
AT HER FLAME.

1:45:55.940 --> 1:45:59.110
YOU JUST KEPT TRYING IT TO

1:45:59.180 --> 1:46:01.450
RESUSCITATE A DEAD FIRE AND YOU

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:02.020
DID.

1:46:02.080 --> 1:46:02.650
>> YEAH.

1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:03.890
>> I KNOW IT'S JUST MAKING A

1:46:03.950 --> 1:46:06.050
LITTLE FIRE BUT IT SEEMED TO

1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:07.160
REPRESENT A LOT TO TU.

1:46:07.220 --> 1:46:09.320
>> YEAH, NO, THAT WAS A MAJOR

1:46:09.390 --> 1:46:10.460
MOMENT, I MEAN, AND AT A CERTAIN

1:46:10.530 --> 1:46:11.660
POINT IN THE GAME AFTER I

1:46:11.730 --> 1:46:13.360
STARTED, LIKE I WAS ON THE

1:46:13.430 --> 1:46:14.030
BOTTOM.

1:46:14.100 --> 1:46:15.060
AND I HAD THE DO OR DIE THING

1:46:15.130 --> 1:46:17.800
HAPPEN AND SO THERE WAS GOING TO

1:46:17.870 --> 1:46:20.000
IT BE FLEET CHANCES OF ME MAKING

1:46:20.070 --> 1:46:20.700
IT TO THE END.

1:46:20.770 --> 1:46:22.540
SO THE CHANCE I COULD COME MAKE

1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:23.910
A FIRE, MY LAST OPPORTUNITY TO

1:46:23.970 --> 1:46:26.040
DO OR DO, PUT UP OR SHUT UP, YOU

1:46:26.110 --> 1:46:27.280
KNOW, I COMPLETED THE TASK.

1:46:27.340 --> 1:46:28.680
IT IT WAS AMAZING.

1:46:28.740 --> 1:46:30.080
DEFLG SOMETHING I WILL NEVER

1:46:30.150 --> 1:46:31.550
FORGET IT DEFINITELY REMINDED ME

1:46:31.610 --> 1:46:33.320
TO NEVER QUIT, NEVER GIVE UP ON

1:46:33.380 --> 1:46:34.820
MYSELF AND KEEP LOOKING FORWARD.

1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:36.320
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MIGHT

1:46:36.380 --> 1:46:38.890
LOOK LIKE BUT I AM SO HAPPY TO

1:46:38.950 --> 1:46:40.320
BE HERE AND SO THANKFUL THAT I

1:46:40.390 --> 1:46:41.920
HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY.

1:46:41.990 --> 1:46:43.890
IT WAS AMAZING.

1:46:43.960 --> 1:46:44.530
AND THANK YOU-- JUST THANK YOU

1:46:44.590 --> 1:46:45.730
GUYS FOR EVERYTHING.

1:46:45.790 --> 1:46:47.900
APPRECIATE IT.

1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:48.560
>> KUDOS.

1:46:48.630 --> 1:46:50.800
>> YOUR FIRE MAKING CHALLENGE.

1:46:50.870 --> 1:46:52.300
>> DOES ANYBODY NEED PIZZA OR

1:46:52.370 --> 1:46:52.930
CHAMPAGNE.

1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:54.140
>> I WILL TAKE ANYTHING.

1:46:54.200 --> 1:46:56.910
>> LET'S BRING IN SOME MORE.

1:46:56.970 --> 1:46:58.470
LET'S GET SOME REFILLS IN HERE.

1:46:58.540 --> 1:46:59.710
QUICK BREAK, WE'LL BE RIGHT

1:46:59.780 --> 1:46:59.910
BACK.

1:46:59.980 --> 1:47:01.380
7.

1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:02.510
>> UP NEXT, PLAYERS SHARE THEIR

1:47:02.580 --> 1:47:05.050
REACTIONS TO THE BEWARE

1:47:05.110 --> 1:47:07.420
ADVANTAGE AND LIANA RECOUNTS THE

1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:09.120
KNOWLEDGE OF POWER ADVANTAGE

1:47:09.180 --> 1:47:09.790
THAT BACK FIRED.

1:47:09.850 --> 1:47:10.350
PLUS LATER YOUR FIRST LOOK AT

1:47:10.420 --> 1:47:11.290
SURVIVOR 42.

1:47:17.390 --> 1:47:18.160
>> ALL RIGHT, WE ARE BECOME WITH

1:47:18.230 --> 1:47:20.860
SURVIVOR 41 AFTERSHOW, LET'S

1:47:20.930 --> 1:47:22.030
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS

1:47:22.100 --> 1:47:24.100
THAT MADE THIS SEASON UNIQUE.

1:47:24.170 --> 1:47:25.630
IF WE LOOK AT THE BIG THINGS IT

1:47:25.700 --> 1:47:27.470
WOULD BE 26 DAYS WHICH I'M SURE

1:47:27.540 --> 1:47:28.970
IN THE BEGINNING SOME OF YOU

1:47:29.040 --> 1:47:31.040
WERE LIKE OH, THAT DOESN'T FEEL

1:47:31.110 --> 1:47:31.740
LIKE A FULL SEASON.

1:47:31.810 --> 1:47:32.970
IS ANYBODY FEELING LIKE YOU DID

1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:35.280
NOT GET A FULL SEASON.

1:47:35.340 --> 1:47:35.680
>> NO!

1:47:35.740 --> 1:47:36.410
>> NOPE.

1:47:36.480 --> 1:47:37.110
>> NO.

1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:39.250
>> BECAUSE WE OFFSET THE 26 DAYS

1:47:39.310 --> 1:47:41.080
BY TRYING TO APPROXIMATE WHAT A

1:47:41.150 --> 1:47:42.620
39 DAY MIGHT FEEL LIKE.

1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:44.350
AND THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS

1:47:44.420 --> 1:47:45.050
SAID NO FOOD.

1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:47.560
AND THEN WE PUT THESE NEW TWISTS

1:47:47.620 --> 1:47:48.220
IN.

1:47:48.290 --> 1:47:49.890
SO LET'S START WITH THE BEWARE

1:47:49.960 --> 1:47:50.530
ADVANTAGES.

1:47:50.590 --> 1:47:51.530
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU FOUND AN

1:47:51.590 --> 1:47:55.200
IDOL, SHAN FOUND ONE AND NASSEER

1:47:55.260 --> 1:47:56.300
FOUND ONE.

1:47:56.360 --> 1:47:58.030
WHEN YOU FIRST FIND THIS NEW

1:47:58.100 --> 1:47:59.570
ADVANTAGE AND IT SAYS ON THE

1:47:59.630 --> 1:48:01.200
OUTSIDE YOU BETTER WANT THIS IF

1:48:01.270 --> 1:48:03.510
YOU OPEN IT, WAS THERE ANY HESS

1:48:03.570 --> 1:48:04.910
TABLING FROM YOU XANDER.

1:48:04.970 --> 1:48:06.640
>> NO, THIS IS MY SURVIVOR

1:48:06.710 --> 1:48:07.340
EXPERIENCE.

1:48:07.410 --> 1:48:08.880
AND I GET TO BE THE FIRST PERSON

1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:09.950
TO UNFOLD THIS CLOTH AND FIGURE

1:48:10.010 --> 1:48:12.080
OUT WHAT THE TWIST IS.

1:48:12.150 --> 1:48:13.150
I HAVE GOT TO TAKE THAT.

1:48:13.220 --> 1:48:14.680
>> HOW ABOUT YOU SHAN.

1:48:14.750 --> 1:48:17.190
>> IT WAS FOR SURE HESITATION,

1:48:17.250 --> 1:48:19.190
LIKE I LEFT THAT RIGHT WHERE IT

1:48:19.250 --> 1:48:19.860
WAS.

1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:20.520
I ACTUALLY HAD THE INFORMATION

1:48:20.590 --> 1:48:22.020
ABOUT WHAT IT WAS BEFORE HAND

1:48:22.090 --> 1:48:23.330
BECAUSE SOMEONE WHO THOUGHT I

1:48:23.390 --> 1:48:24.730
WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE SHARED A

1:48:24.790 --> 1:48:25.830
LOT OF INFORMATION WITH ME.

1:48:25.890 --> 1:48:28.460
AND THEN THEY GAFER ELED IT OUT.

1:48:28.530 --> 1:48:30.030
AND SO I KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT

1:48:30.100 --> 1:48:31.000
WITHOUT HAVING TO OPEN IT.

1:48:31.070 --> 1:48:32.130
SO I DEFINITELY WENT BACK AND

1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:33.540
FORTH FOR AWHILE.

1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:35.740
BUT THEN LIKE I WAS LIKE I JUST

1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:37.510
WANT IT.

1:48:37.570 --> 1:48:39.570
AND THEN GENIE FOUND IT AND TOLD

1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:41.980
ME SHE FOUND IT.

1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:42.940
>> RICARD AND I WENT AND LOOKED

1:48:43.010 --> 1:48:45.450
AT IT AND CON VINES-- CONVINCED

1:48:45.510 --> 1:48:47.220
GENIE NOT TO OPEN IT, AND WHEN

1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:49.650
NO ONE WAS LOOKING I KIND WENT

1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:50.320
AND OPENED IT.

1:48:50.390 --> 1:48:53.590
I WAS HOPING THAT ENOUGH LUVU

1:48:53.660 --> 1:48:56.420
WOULD FIND THEIRS AND THEY DID.

1:48:56.490 --> 1:48:57.460
>> NASEER, THE PHRASES WERE

1:48:57.530 --> 1:48:59.490
FUNNY SO WHEN YOU HAD TO SAY IT

1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:00.030
AND YOU ARE NOT SURE THAT

1:49:00.100 --> 1:49:01.100
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT IS

1:49:01.160 --> 1:49:02.830
HAPPENING, HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT

1:49:02.900 --> 1:49:04.400
HOW TO DO THAT.

1:49:04.470 --> 1:49:06.700
>> FIRST THING FIRST, WOW, I HAD

1:49:06.770 --> 1:49:09.100
TO MEMORIZE THE PHRASES.

1:49:09.170 --> 1:49:11.070
>> WHICH ONE WAS YOUR PHRASE.

1:49:11.140 --> 1:49:16.980
>> SO I AM AS CONFUSED AS A GOAT

1:49:17.050 --> 1:49:22.050
ON-- SO I'M LIKE, SO I HAD MY--

1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:24.050
I WOULD SAY I TAKE A COUPLE

1:49:24.120 --> 1:49:26.220
COCONUTS WITH ME, GO SIT DOWN

1:49:26.290 --> 1:49:28.560
AND, YOU KNOW, REPEATING AGAIN,

1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:29.260
TRYING TO REMEMBER.

1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:32.390
BUT IT TOOK ME AT LEAST LIKE 50

1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:34.030
TO 60 TIMES.

1:49:34.100 --> 1:49:34.860
>> REALLY?

1:49:34.930 --> 1:49:35.560
>> YEAH.

1:49:35.630 --> 1:49:36.100
AGAIN, YOU KNOW THAT ENGLISH IS

1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:38.170
NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE.

1:49:38.230 --> 1:49:41.140
AND I'M PROUD TO SAY I LEARNED

1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:41.670
ENGLISH WATCHING SURVIVOR.

1:49:41.740 --> 1:49:42.740
>> I LOVE THAT.

1:49:42.800 --> 1:49:43.440
>> AWESOME.

1:49:43.510 --> 1:49:45.710
>> SO TO LEARN A NEW PHRASE FROM

1:49:45.770 --> 1:49:47.810
SURVIVOR, IT IT IS EVEN MORE

1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:49.510
EXCITING, YOU KNOW.

1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:51.850
>> WHAT A GREAT PHRASE.

1:49:51.910 --> 1:49:53.750
>> LET'S GET SOME REFILLS IN

1:49:53.820 --> 1:49:54.250
HERE.

1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:55.080
>> THIS IS SO CRAZY.

1:49:55.150 --> 1:49:57.520
>> ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GETTING A

1:49:57.590 --> 1:49:59.550
LITTLE MORE REFRESHED.

1:49:59.620 --> 1:50:00.860
TIFFANY, AS WE DO THIS, QUESTION

1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:04.890
FOR YOU, DOES EVERYONE KNOW

1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:06.290
ABOUT THE KNIFE CAKE.

1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:08.160
>> XANDER DOES NO.

1:50:08.230 --> 1:50:09.530
>> WHEN YOU DO THAT WHAT WE LIKE

1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:12.900
ABOUT PLANNING A NIGHT SNEAK IS

1:50:12.970 --> 1:50:14.600
THE MISSION IMPOSSIBLE OF IT

1:50:14.670 --> 1:50:15.300
ALL.

1:50:15.370 --> 1:50:16.710
WHICH IS YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF

1:50:16.770 --> 1:50:17.010
CAMP.

1:50:17.070 --> 1:50:17.670
>> YEAH.

1:50:17.740 --> 1:50:18.270
>> YOU ARE AWAY FROM CAMP, YOU

1:50:18.340 --> 1:50:19.770
HAVE TO GET BACK TO CAMP.

1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:21.240
WHICH IS THE SCARIEST PART, IS

1:50:21.310 --> 1:50:23.180
ST LEAVING, BEING GONE, COMING

1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:23.780
BACK.

1:50:23.850 --> 1:50:24.450
>> HE DIDN'T KNOW, AT THAT

1:50:24.510 --> 1:50:26.050
MOMENT, THAT I HAD GOTTEN THAT

1:50:26.110 --> 1:50:26.720
ADVANTAGE.

1:50:26.780 --> 1:50:28.620
AND LIANA AND EVVIE KNEW I HAD

1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:29.680
TO DO IT.

1:50:29.750 --> 1:50:31.120
SO THE MOST DANGEROUS PART WAS

1:50:31.190 --> 1:50:32.420
COMING BACK BECAUSE IT STARTED

1:50:32.490 --> 1:50:34.860
TO LOOK LIKE IT WAS GOING TO

1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:35.520
RAIN.

1:50:35.590 --> 1:50:36.560
AND THAT IS THE ONLY TIME THAT

1:50:36.620 --> 1:50:37.860
XANDER WOULD HAVE WOKEN UP.

1:50:37.930 --> 1:50:39.190
IT IT IT WAS SUPER STRESSFUL BUT

1:50:39.260 --> 1:50:42.800
IT WAS REALLY FUN, IT WAS FUN.

1:50:42.860 --> 1:50:44.400
>> EVVIE, LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE

1:50:44.470 --> 1:50:45.530
OF THE BIG MOVES OF THE SEASON

1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:48.700
WAS LIANA HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF

1:50:48.770 --> 1:50:49.240
POWER.

1:50:49.300 --> 1:50:52.740
>> SHE SURE DID, YES.

1:50:52.810 --> 1:50:55.780
>> YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ASK ONE

1:50:55.840 --> 1:50:56.640
PLAYER THE FOLLOWING TWO

1:50:56.710 --> 1:50:57.510
QUESTIONS, DO YOU HAVE AN

1:50:57.580 --> 1:51:00.850
ADVANTAGE, DO YOU HAVE AN IDOL.

1:51:00.920 --> 1:51:02.350
>> LIANA WENT ON THE JOURNEY AND

1:51:02.420 --> 1:51:04.090
WE STHOWT SHE GAVE AN ADVANTAGE

1:51:04.150 --> 1:51:05.520
TO SHAN BUT IT TURNED OUT SHE

1:51:05.590 --> 1:51:07.320
HAD RECEIVED THE KNOWLEDGE OF

1:51:07.390 --> 1:51:09.520
POWER VAC, AND SHAN REVEALED TO

1:51:09.590 --> 1:51:11.090
TIFFANY WHO THEN TOLD ME THAT

1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:11.730
LIANA HAD AN ADVANTAGE.

1:51:11.790 --> 1:51:15.160
SO THEN I WILLA-- LIANA FELT

1:51:15.230 --> 1:51:16.870
COMPELLED TO TELL ME SHE DOES

1:51:16.930 --> 1:51:20.200
HAVE AN ADVANTAGE, AND WE SAT

1:51:20.270 --> 1:51:21.900
DOWN AND SHE SHOWED MY THE PAPER

1:51:21.970 --> 1:51:23.270
AND I COULD READ HOW IT WORKED.

1:51:23.340 --> 1:51:24.940
SO IT BECAME WHREER THAT LIANA

1:51:25.010 --> 1:51:27.540
WAS NO LONGER WITH US AND XANDER

1:51:27.610 --> 1:51:29.440
HAD BEEN FELLING PEOPLE I'M

1:51:29.510 --> 1:51:30.880
GOING TO PLAY MY IDOL FOR EFI.

1:51:30.950 --> 1:51:31.780
>> SO WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO

1:51:31.850 --> 1:51:33.880
FORMULATE A PLAN, DO YOU HAVE TO

1:51:33.950 --> 1:51:38.020
SAY HEY, MEET ME BY THE TREE, I

1:51:38.090 --> 1:51:39.450
HAVE AN IDEA.

1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:40.560
>> THE AMAZING THING WITH YASE

1:51:40.620 --> 1:51:41.520
IS WE HAD BEEN WORKING TOGETHER

1:51:41.590 --> 1:51:42.920
FOR SO LONG THAT QUICKLY I

1:51:42.990 --> 1:51:44.690
FLASHED TO TIFFANY, WE HAVE TO

1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:45.430
THREUS THE IDOL.

1:51:45.490 --> 1:51:46.960
SHE SAYS WE HAVE TO MOVE THE

1:51:47.030 --> 1:51:48.900
IDOL SO WE RUN INTO THE WOODS,

1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:51.270
XANDER GRABS HIS BACK, REALLY

1:51:51.330 --> 1:51:53.070
QUICKLY WE SHOVE EVERYTHING

1:51:53.130 --> 1:51:55.670
DOWN, AND PUT THE FAKE IDOL IN

1:51:55.740 --> 1:51:57.510
HIS CROTCH RIGHT AS LIANA SHOWS

1:51:57.570 --> 1:51:58.010
UP.

1:51:58.070 --> 1:52:00.880
>> IT IT WAS CHAOS.

1:52:00.940 --> 1:52:02.340
>> YOU HAVE TO PROTECT THIS.

1:52:02.410 --> 1:52:07.150
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1:52:07.220 --> 1:52:07.720
>> FOR SURE.

1:52:07.780 --> 1:52:09.350
>> 100 PERCENT.

1:52:09.420 --> 1:52:10.050
>> OKAY.

1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:11.220
>> AND THE TIMING COULD NOT HAVE

1:52:11.290 --> 1:52:12.750
BEEN MORE PER SPECT BECAUSE SHE

1:52:12.820 --> 1:52:14.820
FELT SHE WALKED IN OP HIM

1:52:14.890 --> 1:52:16.560
PUTTING THE REAL IDOL IN HIS

1:52:16.620 --> 1:52:19.090
PANTS, SHE REALLY BELIEVED THAT

1:52:19.160 --> 1:52:20.600
WE STILL TRUSTED HER EVEN THOUGH

1:52:20.660 --> 1:52:22.000
WE REALLY DIDN'T AND REALLY SAW

1:52:22.060 --> 1:52:23.200
THE WRITING ON THE WALL.

1:52:23.260 --> 1:52:25.170
AND GOT TO GIVE IT TO XANDER, HE

1:52:25.230 --> 1:52:27.140
ACTED THE HELL OUT OF THAT.

1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:28.700
AND TO BE HONEST, YOU KNOW, IT

1:52:28.770 --> 1:52:30.170
WAS A REALLY SCARY MOMENT

1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:31.640
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY I

1:52:31.710 --> 1:52:32.970
STILL ALMOST WENT HOME BUT TO

1:52:33.040 --> 1:52:35.540
KNOW THAT WE HAD THIS ADVANTAGE,

1:52:35.610 --> 1:52:37.450
WE USED OUR RELATIONSHIP, OUR

1:52:37.510 --> 1:52:38.150
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE WERE SHARING

1:52:38.210 --> 1:52:39.550
AS A GROUP TO REALLY THWART THE

1:52:39.610 --> 1:52:40.480
FIRST TIME EVER THAT THIS

1:52:40.550 --> 1:52:42.050
AVANTAGE WAS PLAYED, IT IT IT

1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:44.950
WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT.

1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:45.650
>> XANDER, WHEN YOU WATCH A

1:52:45.720 --> 1:52:46.820
MOMENT LIKE THAT AS AN AUDIENCE

1:52:46.890 --> 1:52:49.560
MEMBER, YOU FORGET YOU ARE

1:52:49.620 --> 1:52:50.260
WATCHING REAL PEOPLE.

1:52:50.330 --> 1:52:52.060
ST KIND OF STARTS TO FEEL LIKE A

1:52:52.130 --> 1:52:53.360
DRAMA THAT YOU ARE WATCHING.

1:52:53.430 --> 1:52:55.760
BUT WHERE IS THE HEARTBEAT,

1:52:55.830 --> 1:52:57.500
WHERE IS THE ADRENALINE RUSH

1:52:57.570 --> 1:53:01.100
BECAUSE AS EFI DESCRIBED IT,

1:53:01.170 --> 1:53:02.600
LIANA IS SECONDS AWAY FROM

1:53:02.670 --> 1:53:03.270
SHOWING UP.

1:53:03.340 --> 1:53:04.670
>> IT IS SUCH A RUSH THAT YOU

1:53:04.740 --> 1:53:05.840
HAVE TO FORMULATE THIS PLAN AND

1:53:05.910 --> 1:53:07.840
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT TO DO

1:53:07.910 --> 1:53:09.040
BASED OFF OF INFORMATION THAT

1:53:09.110 --> 1:53:10.810
I'M NOT EVEN SURE IS TRUE.

1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:11.780
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST

1:53:11.850 --> 1:53:13.950
BUT WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO FOR

1:53:14.020 --> 1:53:16.020
IT ANYWAY AND SNAP, SHE'S HERE

1:53:16.080 --> 1:53:17.320
SO WE JUST GOT TO DO IT.

1:53:17.390 --> 1:53:20.690
SO I GUESS WE'VE GOT A PLAN.

1:53:20.760 --> 1:53:22.020
>> AND LIANA WHEN YOU ARE

1:53:22.090 --> 1:53:23.420
SITTING AT TRIBAL AND READY TO

1:53:23.490 --> 1:53:26.030
MAKE THIS BIG MOVE AND FLIP THE

1:53:26.090 --> 1:53:26.930
GAME UPSIDE DOWN, WALK ME

1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:28.430
THROUGH WHAT YOU WERE FEELING

1:53:28.500 --> 1:53:30.330
AND THEN HOW IT FELT WHEN YOU

1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:31.700
REALIZED YOU HAD BEEN HAD.

1:53:31.770 --> 1:53:32.830
>> YEAH, SO IT IT WAS A REALLY

1:53:32.900 --> 1:53:35.270
BIG DEAL THAT I EVEN GOT THE

1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:35.970
ADVANTAGE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1:53:36.040 --> 1:53:38.440
AND I GOT IT, I'M LIKE WOW, THE

1:53:38.510 --> 1:53:39.540
KNOWLEDGE OF POWER ADVANTAGE,

1:53:39.610 --> 1:53:41.680
LIKE THAT SOUNDS LIKE MY ENTIRE

1:53:41.740 --> 1:53:44.110
EXPERIENCE BEING AT YASE BECAUSE

1:53:44.180 --> 1:53:45.950
THIS WHOLE TIME THE GUY IS LIKE

1:53:46.010 --> 1:53:47.380
I'M THE ONLY ONE NOT IN IT, I

1:53:47.450 --> 1:53:48.920
KNEW IT THE WHOLE TIME SO THIS

1:53:48.980 --> 1:53:50.150
IS GREAT, THIS IS LIKE THE

1:53:50.220 --> 1:53:51.520
PERFECT ADVANTAGE FOR ME, THE

1:53:51.590 --> 1:53:53.820
MOST POWERFUL EVER.

1:53:53.890 --> 1:53:56.120
SO I TOLD EVVIE THE ADVANTAGE,

1:53:56.190 --> 1:53:58.190
AND I KNEW IT WAS SUPER RISKY

1:53:58.260 --> 1:54:01.260
GOING IN, I GO TO SHAN, I REALLY

1:54:01.330 --> 1:54:01.900
THINK THEY MOVED IT.

1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:03.970
I'M NOT SO SURE, AND I SAID

1:54:04.030 --> 1:54:06.030
SOMETHING WAS OFF, LIKE MY

1:54:06.100 --> 1:54:07.000
SPIEDY SENSES WERE GOING.

1:54:07.070 --> 1:54:08.470
THIS IS A RISKY GAME, HE WASN'T

1:54:08.540 --> 1:54:10.040
TO MAKE THIS BIG MOVE, I AM JUST

1:54:10.100 --> 1:54:11.470
GOING TO TRUST NIE SELF.

1:54:11.540 --> 1:54:14.010
>> I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR

1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:14.980
ONE PLAYER.

1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:20.080
DO YOU HAVE AN IDOL XANDER.

1:54:20.150 --> 1:54:22.050
>> NO, BUT YOU CAN HAVE THE

1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:22.680
STICK.

1:54:22.750 --> 1:54:24.720
>> IT BLEW UP IN MY FACE BUT

1:54:24.790 --> 1:54:26.050
ALSO IT WAS ALSO ONE OF THE

1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:26.820
PROUDEST MOMENTS IN TERMS OF THE

1:54:26.890 --> 1:54:28.660
GAME FOR ME IN TERMS OF HOW I

1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:29.290
RESPONDED.

1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:30.260
>> DID YOU HANDLE IT REALLY

1:54:30.330 --> 1:54:30.890
WELL.

1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:31.760
>> YEAH, THAT IS WHAT IS SO

1:54:31.830 --> 1:54:33.160
BEAUTIFUL ABOUT SURVIVOR FOR ME,

1:54:33.230 --> 1:54:35.460
AND THIS EXPERIENCE IS THAT I

1:54:35.530 --> 1:54:38.030
FELL ON MY FACE.

1:54:38.100 --> 1:54:39.170
>> SORRY.

1:54:39.230 --> 1:54:40.900
>> I LIKE FACE PLANTED FOR SURE

1:54:40.970 --> 1:54:43.740
BUT LIKE HONESTLY, IN MY, I FEEL

1:54:43.810 --> 1:54:46.270
LIKE I'M REALLY A PES MIST A LOT

1:54:46.340 --> 1:54:48.110
OF TIME AND DON'T REALLY BELIEVE

1:54:48.180 --> 1:54:48.740
IN MYSELF.

1:54:48.810 --> 1:54:49.640
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TALK TO

1:54:49.710 --> 1:54:51.280
PEOPLE AFTER THAT BECAUSE THEY

1:54:51.350 --> 1:54:53.880
SAW ME FALL ON MY FACE, I AM

1:54:53.950 --> 1:54:55.550
KIND OF WORTHLESS, YOU KNOW, AND

1:54:55.620 --> 1:54:56.720
THERE WERE THESE VOICES IN MY

1:54:56.780 --> 1:54:59.290
HEAD OF SAYING LIKE IT'S OKAY TO

1:54:59.350 --> 1:54:59.850
FAIL.

1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:01.660
LIKE IT'S OKAY TO FAIL.

1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:03.120
AND HONESTLY, LIKE THAT WAS THE

1:55:03.190 --> 1:55:04.560
PROUDEST MOMENT FOR ME BECAUSE

1:55:04.630 --> 1:55:05.960
IT COULD HAVE GONE SO DIFFERENT

1:55:06.030 --> 1:55:06.660
IN MY MIND.

1:55:06.730 --> 1:55:08.130
LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THIS

1:55:08.200 --> 1:55:10.000
PERSON IS RIGHT NOW THAT KIND OF

1:55:10.060 --> 1:55:11.870
JUST GOT BACK UP AND IS LIKE,

YOU KNOW, TRYING TO PICK UP THE

1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:14.570
PIECES.

1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:15.270
AND SO IT IT WAS JUST REALLY

1:55:15.340 --> 1:55:18.710
SPECIAL FOR ME BEING LIANA AFTER

1:55:18.770 --> 1:55:19.470
THAT MOMENT.

1:55:19.540 --> 1:55:20.880
>> DO YOU THINK THAT IS

1:55:20.940 --> 1:55:21.580
PERMANENT?

1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:23.950
>> I HOPE SO, YEAH, I WANT IT TO

1:55:24.010 --> 1:55:24.610
BE.

1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:25.310
AND THAT IS THE THING, LIKE I

1:55:25.380 --> 1:55:27.150
THINK LEAVING THIS GAME I AM AN

1:55:27.220 --> 1:55:27.750
ENTIRELY NEW PERSON.

1:55:27.820 --> 1:55:29.920
I FEEL LIKE I WAS KIND OF

1:55:29.980 --> 1:55:30.550
REBORN.

1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:32.490
I DO IF I DO FAIL, LIKE JUST

1:55:32.550 --> 1:55:33.690
COME BACK TO THIS MOMENT, WHERE

1:55:33.760 --> 1:55:36.290
THERE IS THIS VOICE IN YOUR

HEADLINING I DID BUT YOU CAN GET

YOU GO GET THROUGH IT, YOU

1:55:47.470 --> 1:55:48.540
REQUEST GET THROUGH ANYTHING.

1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:51.540
I WAS SO PROUD THE NEXT MORNING,

1:55:51.610 --> 1:55:52.710
TALKING TO I WAS LIKE I KNOW

1:55:52.770 --> 1:55:54.580
THA WAS HECIAL BUT THAT IS THE

1:55:54.640 --> 1:55:56.140
MOVE THAT I THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR

1:55:56.210 --> 1:55:56.810
ME AT THAT TIME.

1:55:56.880 --> 1:55:59.950
IT ST KIND OF LIKE OWNING THAT

1:56:00.010 --> 1:56:01.520
MOMENT.

1:56:01.580 --> 1:56:03.150
AND HONE-- HONESTLY, THAT WAS MY

1:56:03.220 --> 1:56:04.220
PROUDEST MOMENT IN THIS GAME.

1:56:04.290 --> 1:56:05.790
>> AND HOW IRONIC IS KNOWLEDGE

1:56:05.850 --> 1:56:07.720

IN A MOMENTS WE'LL TAKE A BREAK

>> YEAH, I MEAN I AM STRUGGLING.

1:59:42.840 --> 1:59:44.140
I HAD AN IMAGE OF MY HEAD OF

WHAT MY JOURNEY WAS GOING TO IT

1:59:45.940 --> 1:59:46.540

BUT SHOW EVEN THOUGH THE END

1:59:53.180 --> 1:59:55.480
POINT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR

1:59:55.550 --> 1:59:57.690
ME AND I'M WORKING THROUGH IT,

1:59:57.750 --> 2:00:02.060
IT WAS BIGGER AND MORE BEAUTIFUL

2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:04.060
AND INTENSE AND I'M MORE PROUD

2:00:04.130 --> 2:00:05.590
OF MYSELF THAN I THOUGHT WAS

2:00:05.660 --> 2:00:07.300
POSSIBLE EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T

2:00:07.360 --> 2:00:09.030
ACHIEVE MY GOAL.

2:00:09.100 --> 2:00:10.930
LIKE I DID AWESOME.

2:00:11.000 --> 2:00:12.130
SHAN AND I DID AWESOME.

WE WERE LIKE A POWER COUPLE THIS

2:00:15.370 --> 2:00:15.970
WHOLE DAMN TIME.

2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:19.240
AND IT IS AMAZING TO ME, LIKE

2:00:19.310 --> 2:00:20.140
WHAT I AM CAPABLE.

2:00:20.210 --> 2:00:22.580

2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:24.110
LIKE TO SAY TOO.

2:00:24.180 --> 2:00:24.810
>> DANNY.

2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:26.080
>> JUST BECAUSE I THINK I GOT A

2:00:26.150 --> 2:00:27.580
LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING

2:00:27.650 --> 2:00:28.250
DIFFERENT OUT HERE THAN POSSIBLY

2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:29.080
EVERYBODY ELSE.

2:00:29.150 --> 2:00:31.050
I CAME OUT HERE THINKING THAT I

2:00:31.120 --> 2:00:32.120
JUST WANTED TO COMPETE, TRY TO

2:00:32.190 --> 2:00:35.420
FIND SOMETHING TO COMPETE AT AND

2:00:35.490 --> 2:00:36.120
WIN.

2:00:36.190 --> 2:00:37.060
AND I ACTUALLY CAME OUT HERE AND

2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:39.030
FOUND OUT THAT I HAD A 25 YEAR

2:00:39.090 --> 2:00:41.400
OLD DEMON THAT I THOUGHT I WAS

2:00:41.460 --> 2:00:44.170
USING TO PROPEL ME FORWARD IN

2:00:44.230 --> 2:00:45.130
COMPETITIONS, AND LIFE.

2:00:45.200 --> 2:00:47.100
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I FUND

2:00:47.170 --> 2:00:49.200
OUT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I

2:00:49.270 --> 2:00:49.840
NEEDED TO RELEASE.

2:00:49.900 --> 2:00:50.540
>> HAVE YOU SHARED WHAT THAT

2:00:50.610 --> 2:00:53.910
DEMON IS OR MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT

2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:54.540
TO.

2:00:54.610 --> 2:00:56.010
>> MY DAD PASSED WHEN I WAS

2:00:56.080 --> 2:00:56.640
EIGHT.

2:00:56.710 --> 2:00:58.310
AND WE HAD THIS, I HAVE THIS

2:00:58.380 --> 2:00:59.650
HISTORY WITH CAR ACCIDENTS.

2:00:59.710 --> 2:01:02.150
AND AS AN EIGHT YEAR OLD BOY I

2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:03.220
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE

2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:05.690
COULDN'T BE STILL ALIVE.

2:01:05.750 --> 2:01:08.060
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE I WAS UPSET

2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:09.790
AND I WAS MAD AT EVERYBODY WHO

2:01:09.860 --> 2:01:10.760
HAD THEIR DAD THERE.

2:01:10.830 --> 2:01:12.160
THEN I STARTED TO BECOME A

2:01:12.230 --> 2:01:14.600
CHANGE IN ASHAMEDDED AT MYSELF

2:01:14.660 --> 2:01:15.860

2:01:15.930 --> 2:01:17.130
MAY 4th WAS THE 25th

2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:18.770

WE WERE ALL OUT HERE.

2:01:20.700 --> 2:01:24.140
AND IT WAS, IT WAS HARD.

2:01:24.210 --> 2:01:26.140
BUT THEY KEPT ME LAUGHING.

2:01:26.210 --> 2:01:28.040
AND I REALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

2:01:28.110 --> 2:01:30.110
TO SIT BACK AND THINK THAT THIS

2:01:30.180 --> 2:01:32.150
HAS BEEN HOLDING ME BACK, NOT

2:01:32.210 --> 2:01:32.980
PROPELLING ME FORWARD.

2:01:33.050 --> 2:01:36.150
AND I LET IT GO AND AMAZINGLY I

AND HE GAVE ME JUST ENOUGH TIME

2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:50.800
TO WIN THAT CHALLENGE.

2:01:50.870 --> 2:01:53.430

2:03:20.590 --> 2:03:21.590

2:03:21.660 --> 2:03:23.120

THE TOUGHEST PEOPLE OUT HERE.

2:03:32.070 --> 2:03:34.030
AND I WAS JUST REFLECTING THAT

2:03:34.100 --> 2:03:35.270
IF I WAS 20, I COULD NEVER LOOK

2:03:35.340 --> 2:03:37.910
