WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.536
I'm gonna miss you so much,

00:02.570 --> 00:04.638
but we can speak on the computer
so you'll see my face.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.707
But we won't be able
to touch you.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.209
Hey, look.
You'll still have me.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.179
-Just you?
-Yes. Just-- Your father. Hi.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.259
* My whole life I just wanted
to be a rapper *

00:25.293 --> 00:28.596
* Then I grew'd up
and the boy became a rapper *

00:28.629 --> 00:31.832
* And my older sister made me
wear the golden wrapper *

00:31.865 --> 00:33.701
* She said, "Watch out,
'cause you know *

00:33.734 --> 00:35.002
* The hos will trap ya." *

00:35.035 --> 00:37.037
Hello there.
I'm Dr. Mecklebaum.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.240
-I'm Dave Burd. How are you?
-Good. Good to see you.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.742
So, uh...
what brings you in today?

00:41.775 --> 00:43.411
So, a few days ago
I was shaving,

00:43.444 --> 00:45.513
and I noticed these red bumps
on my pubiscus,

00:45.546 --> 00:47.615
-and I just wanted...
-P-Pubiscus?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.917
That's probably
not the medical term for it.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.719
Uh, like, where
your pubic hair would be

00:51.752 --> 00:53.687
if you didn't shave it
all the way.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.888
-Oh. Oh, copy that. All right.
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:54.922 --> 00:56.424
So, well, let's take a look.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.093
Yes, and I know this
is gonna sound so absurd,

00:59.127 --> 01:00.961
but before I can just
show you my penis,

01:00.994 --> 01:02.430
I do have to kind of explain

01:02.463 --> 01:04.798
-a few things about it to you.
-Okay.

01:04.832 --> 01:08.236
I just have, like,
a very bizarre situation down--

01:08.269 --> 01:10.471
okay, when I was born,

01:10.504 --> 01:12.140
I came out of the womb
with a tangled urethra,

01:12.173 --> 01:13.741
so immediately they had to go in

01:13.774 --> 01:15.309
-and do all types
of surgery to it.
-Mm-hmm.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.044
As a result, there's so much
scarring down there.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.479
-Sure.
-And then, I mean,

01:18.512 --> 01:19.947
you know how the skin
on your testicles

01:19.980 --> 01:22.082
is a different type of skin
than the skin on your penis?

01:22.116 --> 01:25.286
It's more...
chicken-skinned or ribbed.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.887
Yeah?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.622
So my dick skin
is actually made of

01:28.656 --> 01:30.624
that exact same style
of ribbing.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.626
All the way up my shaft-- ribs.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.762
So my theory is:
when they had to replace

01:34.795 --> 01:36.164
the hacked-off dick skin,

01:36.197 --> 01:38.599
they used my testicle skin
to replace it.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.934
Which would mean that my dick

01:40.968 --> 01:43.304
is made of balls.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.907
I couldn't be more precious
about this information.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.842
My own girlfriend doesn't know
anything about this

01:48.876 --> 01:50.978
because I'm so good at
controlling the lighting and...

01:51.011 --> 01:52.246
Well, if-if you're comfortable,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.182
I'm-I'm more than happy
to take a look.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.916
I just had to explain all that,
'cause I didn't want you

01:55.949 --> 01:57.385
to look at it and be like...

01:58.486 --> 01:59.587
-You know? Yeah.
-Yeah. Sure.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.754
-Okay.
-Okay.

02:00.788 --> 02:01.989
Okay.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.260
(quietly):
Yeah.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.662
Those look like
razor bumps to me.

02:08.696 --> 02:12.166
Okay. I mean, but can't genital
herpes look like razor bumps?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.801
Who's to say
that it's razor bumps?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.836
I'm to say. It's my job.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.339
Well, you should know
there's a very big disconnect

02:18.372 --> 02:20.107
between the online
medical community

02:20.140 --> 02:21.342
and the brick-and-mortar
establishments,

02:21.375 --> 02:22.343
-like...
-Brick-and-mortar?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.844
You mean... doctors.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.112
While I have you here,
real quick,

02:25.145 --> 02:27.348
I know this is a totally
different field of medicine.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.883
I have all this acne on my back
that came out of nowhere...

02:29.917 --> 02:31.018
-Yeah, not me.
-Cystic.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.386
Yeah, not it.
No, it's not me.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.489
I just figured you must know
more than, like, the common man.

02:35.523 --> 02:36.524
I could refer you to somebody.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.993
-Not my field.
-Thank you.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.129
-You're welcome, Dave.
-Hey, where do I pay?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.531
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* I'm Lil Dicky *

02:43.564 --> 02:44.665
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* Who's Dave? *

02:44.698 --> 02:45.699
* Hi, I'm Dave. *

02:47.601 --> 02:49.603
(hip-hop music pulsing inside)

02:53.241 --> 02:54.742
Oh.

02:54.775 --> 02:55.809
*

02:55.843 --> 02:56.844
Is this the right room?

02:56.877 --> 02:58.312
-(music stops)
-Uh, is this Studio A?

02:58.346 --> 03:00.180
The fuck is that smell, man?

03:00.214 --> 03:03.150
Oh, man, this dude
always coming in here

03:03.183 --> 03:05.018
-with this tuna fish shit.
-Okay, are we leaving?

03:05.052 --> 03:06.720
I'm gonna be right back.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.590
Why the fuck would you just walk
into a session like that?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.259
You said "come anytime,"
those were your words.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.026
Yeah, come by, kick it
in the lounge and, like,

03:13.060 --> 03:15.429
I don't know, meet people, talk
to people, make connections.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.398
Don't come into a fucking
studio session

03:17.431 --> 03:20.000
with tuna fish.
It smells crazy.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.902
Well, forgive me for not knowing
this incredibly specific rule.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.437
-That's...
-Is that YG? Oh, my God.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.605
They're-- Yep, that's YG.
They're coming. Wow.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.673
YG:
Whup their ass
when you see 'em,

03:25.706 --> 03:26.940
straight like that.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.175
-Yeah.
-What's up?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.511
Studio smell like tuna, man.
This shit stank.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.612
Fuck going on?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.414
(indistinct chatter)

03:33.447 --> 03:34.548
That's a scary group of men.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.417
He had tattoos
on the creases of his neck.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.019
I'm so scared. I don't know
if I'm supposed to speak

03:39.052 --> 03:40.754
or not speak
when I'm spoken to or...

03:40.788 --> 03:42.756
Doesn't sound like a very
collaborative setting to me.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.926
-Not at all.
-Is there any window
for you to show them my video?

03:45.959 --> 03:49.563
No. These gang members obviously
do not like dick jokes.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.432
Know your audience, my dude.
I love you like a sister.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.466
I have to leave.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.936
-Text me.
-Nope.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.483
* My dick sucks,
my dick sucks. *

04:11.118 --> 04:12.085
Hold up.

04:12.119 --> 04:13.220
Hold the fuck up.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.254
Ain't you the YouTube rapper

04:14.288 --> 04:15.289
with the small dick
and all that?

04:15.323 --> 04:17.391
-I've seen that video.
-Did you like it?

04:17.425 --> 04:18.826
Yeah, that shit go hard.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.962
You have no idea how happy
this makes me.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.431
Like, I live my entire life

04:23.464 --> 04:26.900
trying to impress people
of your... pedigree.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.902
-I'm Dave.
-Ha, Dave, you a fool.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.404
I'm Gata, like alligator.

04:30.438 --> 04:31.772
I just rolled this chopstick.

04:31.805 --> 04:33.240
You trying to smoke some weed?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.509
Smoke weed?
Uh, do I want to smoke wee...?

04:35.543 --> 04:37.277
I don't think--
No, no, thank you.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.179
So you a rapper,
and you don't blow bud?

04:39.212 --> 04:40.481
I didn't say that, I smoke.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.650
I treat it like a glass of wine
at the end of the day.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.185
If I smoked this early, I'd feel
like a total waste of life.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.122
But did you see that YG's here?

04:49.156 --> 04:50.358
Yeah, why you think I'm here?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.159
My nigga Bino sell him tree
all the time.

04:52.192 --> 04:54.528
How would I go about
getting a rapper like YG

04:54.562 --> 04:56.430
on one of my songs?
Because I feel like,

04:56.464 --> 04:58.666
until I do that, no one's
gonna take me seriously.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.434
Everyone's just gonna think
I'm a YouTube rapper.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.670
Shit. It's all about the gander.

05:02.703 --> 05:03.704
The gander?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.506
The gander, nigga.
You got to wiggle,

05:05.539 --> 05:08.108
set yourself up, make a play.
Right now you're in the studio,

05:08.141 --> 05:10.277
all these rappers
in here popping,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.145
and you talking about,
"Hi, my name is Dave."

05:12.179 --> 05:13.847
Like, what the hell?
Like, you should be, like,

05:13.881 --> 05:17.017
"What's up? It's Lil Dicky."
Like, own that shit, bro.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.486
I do think it's gonna be
the biggest name

05:18.519 --> 05:20.287
in hip-hop, honestly.
Lil Dicky.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.522
Ride your own dick, man.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.857
Can we get some food?
YG hungry.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.959
Oh. I don't know why
you're asking me.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.160
I don't work here.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.663
I, uh-- I'm Lil Dicky.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.198
-Lil Dicky?
-Yes.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.300
Can we get some food?
YG hungry.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.335
Okay. You know,
I respect you, I just think

05:35.369 --> 05:37.371
-you're going about it
all kind of wrong.
-Hey-hey-hey, chill-chill-chill.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.972
Hey, bro, there's a store
right around the corner;

05:39.006 --> 05:40.374
we gonna bend the block
real fast

05:40.408 --> 05:41.509
and get whatever you need.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.710
Come on, man.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.877
He look hot.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.345
I hope these are
the right snacks, Gata.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.814
Man, if you don't stop tripping,

05:46.847 --> 05:48.482
I'm a real nigga. If I tell you
there's cheese on the moon,

05:48.516 --> 05:49.683
bring your crackers, man.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.652
You Gucci. You're gonna
go in there, show your face,

05:51.685 --> 05:52.986
apply the gander, wiggle up.

05:53.020 --> 05:56.490
How can this possibly
get me closer to a YG verse?

05:56.524 --> 05:58.426
Check this out. I used to be
in Miami all the time,

05:58.459 --> 06:00.661
-at the Hit Factory.
It's a studio.
-Yeah?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.262
I'm in there with my boys.
We chilling with some dudes

06:02.295 --> 06:04.732
from New Orleans. You know
how they dress already, right?

06:04.765 --> 06:07.034
-No.
-Big T-shirts, baggy jeans.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.437
We're in they studio session
and Wayne walk in, bro.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.204
-I'm in there dripping.
-Lil Wayne?

06:11.238 --> 06:12.873
Weezy! What other Wayne
you know?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.875
-Brady.
-I'm in there
sauced down, though.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.911
-Gretzky.
-Skinny jeans, Cali swag,
all that-- lip ring.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.380
And they on my swag, bro.
Wayne like, "What you do?"

06:20.414 --> 06:22.783
And I end up getting three songs
off the drip alone.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.518
You have three songs
with Lil Wayne?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.186
Yes, that's what I'm trying
to tell you.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.421
They're on my laptop;
they ain't never came out,

06:27.455 --> 06:28.856
but you know how that go.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.224
This is very useful information.
If I would've known all this,

06:31.258 --> 06:33.894
I would've certainly
dressed differently today.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.464
The swag ain't on you,
it's in you.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.566
Like, what is that, peach?

06:38.599 --> 06:39.867
They gonna fuck with that,
that's hard body.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.235
You got a lot of heart
for wearing that color.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.804
Well-- great.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.238
Do I just knock or what?
What do you think?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.807
Yeah, just knock in
on that shit, man.

06:46.840 --> 06:47.941
(hip-hop music playing inside)

06:47.975 --> 06:50.811
I feel like they're not
ever gonna...

06:52.613 --> 06:54.715
Why are you wearing
your sunglasses inside?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.249
Bro, you know I got
to drip, bro.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.551
-We're going to the studio
right now.
-Should I just...?

06:57.585 --> 06:58.952
YG, you're about
to get a verse, okay?

06:58.986 --> 07:00.954
-Should I walk in?
-Man, go in there, man.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.390
Snack time. I...

07:03.423 --> 07:04.658
Okay.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.093
You're welcome.

07:06.126 --> 07:08.962
I feel like that did nothing
for my career.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.164
Bro, "snack time"?
Did you really just say

07:11.198 --> 07:13.233
that corny-ass shit, bro?
What the fuck?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.434
Give me your phone, man.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.769
My phone? Why?

07:15.803 --> 07:18.572
Listen, if you want to get
that verse from YG, bro,

07:18.606 --> 07:20.574
you're gonna have to holler
at Nutti, man.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.409
-Who is Nutti?
-Nutti.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.111
That's YG manager.
I'm the plug, bro.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.780
-I'm putting his number
in your phone.
-This couldn't be more helpful.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.749
So, what do I do? I text him
and say, "Hi, it's Lil Dicky..."

07:28.782 --> 07:30.250
Yeah, he probably gonna want
some money or something

07:30.283 --> 07:31.585
-for the verse.
-Money? Okay.

07:31.619 --> 07:32.686
Well, I'll figure that out.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.987
You have to bring that bag.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.023
I just saved mine, too, bro.
We got to get up, man.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.190
Huh.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.159
Let me get you on my Gram, man.
If you don't mind.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.128
Yeah. Okay, hold on,
let me think for a second.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.262
You ready? Uh...

07:42.295 --> 07:44.364
Early morning studio,
LD reporting for...

07:44.397 --> 07:46.033
Nigga, this is just
a picture, bro.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.706
(hip-hop music playing faintly)

07:52.740 --> 07:56.276
Ugh, there's so much lettuce
on this.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.778
No, I told them no lettuce.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.013
Oh, he told me you made him
try a grape for the first time.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.716
I did. But he did not like it.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.718
He reported it was "too gushy."

08:04.752 --> 08:06.787
-Who eats those things?
-MIKE: Most people.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.322
-Are you gonna
grade papers right now?
-Yeah.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.825
I've told you how much
this fully turns me on, right?

08:11.859 --> 08:13.360
-Yeah.
-I've expressed that?

08:13.393 --> 08:15.395
-Wow.
-Yeah.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.964
You want me to teach you?

08:16.997 --> 08:18.465
-Everything that you know.
-You want me to

08:18.498 --> 08:20.668
tell you when to nap
on your cot?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.803
My dick wants to rip out
of its skin

08:22.836 --> 08:25.005
and run laps
around the playground.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.408
I don't know...
where to go with that.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.211
-You can go into Dave's room,
where this shit belongs.
-ALLY: I'm sorry.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.980
That's on me, coach.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.848
It's-it's easy.

08:34.882 --> 08:38.552
Yeah. But every now
and then I just... I guess,

08:38.586 --> 08:41.254
-lose my grip on reality.
-Dave? Don't.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.923
Really can't even
be tamed, stopped...

08:42.956 --> 08:45.893
Don't do it.
Don't, I'm serious. Don't!

08:45.926 --> 08:47.327
Okay. You sealed your fate.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.362
I'm gonna finish
Handmaid's Tale without you.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.731
-Stop.
-Yep, I will.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.566
Girlfriend, what?
Get away from me, freak.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.867
-You gross me out.
-(chuckles)

08:53.901 --> 08:55.936
-That's better.
-ALLY: The assignment

08:55.969 --> 08:58.438
is to draw what you want to be
when you grow up,

08:58.471 --> 09:00.874
and nobody drew a day trader.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.343
No? Did any of them draw
a kindergarten teacher?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.444
-(chuckles): No.
-No.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.013
I bet a lot of them
said they wanted to be

09:06.046 --> 09:07.615
-a musical artist, right?
-A few.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.782
I mean, that was always

09:08.816 --> 09:10.283
-my dream growing up.
-I think you're right.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.453
Some young, bright,
wet-behind-the-ears kid

09:13.486 --> 09:15.388
that's like,
"I want to be an unemployed Jew

09:15.422 --> 09:17.224
who pretends to be a rapper."

09:17.257 --> 09:19.526
-(chuckles)
-And then you're
the inspiration.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.928
Or...

09:20.961 --> 09:23.096
I'm a "once in a generation"
artist...

09:23.130 --> 09:24.464
Oh.

09:24.497 --> 09:25.532
...who just got verified
on Twitter

09:25.565 --> 09:27.234
about, what, nine days ago?

09:27.267 --> 09:29.536
I'm glad you feel good that a
robot told you you're worth it.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.271
Actually, I'm gonna go
back there and just see

09:31.304 --> 09:32.572
what's going on-- tap in--
because I feel like

09:32.606 --> 09:33.807
there's people all over trying
to get ahold of me,

09:33.841 --> 09:35.943
-ask me questions. You know.
-Mm-hmm.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.410
-Do you want a hit of this?
-No.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.112
Last time I got stoned,
I talked to our neighbor Gary

09:39.146 --> 09:40.247
for an hour about cement.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.782
He calls it see-ment.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.451
-I hate parent-teacher night.
-Mm.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.486
Like, Jordan Beyers's parents
are riding me

09:46.519 --> 09:49.122
about his reading comprehension,
but the kid literally eats sand.

09:49.156 --> 09:52.092
-(phone chimes)
-Fistfuls of sand.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.560
Every day of his life.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.328
Holy moly.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.730
What?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.932
(grunting rhythmically)

09:58.966 --> 10:00.634
(Ally laughs)

10:00.668 --> 10:02.836
Huge turning point moment
in my career just occurred.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.438
-What?
-I was in the studio

10:05.472 --> 10:06.573
with YG today.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.108
-YG?
-Yes.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.342
Yes, I've heard of them.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.577
It's one guy, it's not a group.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.412
-Okay. Still cool.
-Yeah.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.814
What was he like?
What did he say?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.248
(stammers)
Well, we didn't really--

10:15.282 --> 10:16.817
I mean, when you're
in the studio,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.585
you don't really talk that much.
You just, like, vibe

10:18.618 --> 10:20.120
-and listen to music.
-Okay.

10:20.153 --> 10:23.323
But the really cool thing is,
his manager just texted me

10:23.356 --> 10:25.759
and said that YG will get
on one of my songs.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.661
-Dave.
-I kn-- uh, yeah,
I'm very excited.

10:27.695 --> 10:30.330
That's so cool.
Wait, what song?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.765
-(laughs): What...?
-Uh, what song?

10:31.799 --> 10:32.866
Can I hear it?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.602
You can hear it when it's done.
It's not done.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.138
I know. I don't like having
too many cooks in the kitchen...

10:38.171 --> 10:40.540
-But I won't cook.
I'm just excited.
-Bless your soul.

10:40.573 --> 10:42.810
No, though, 'cause I just,
you know-- trust the process.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.944
-Dave.
-What?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.512
You always do this.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.480
Do you realize
that I'm dating a rapper

10:47.514 --> 10:49.616
who I've never heard
rap out loud?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.218
Oh, my God,
will you rap for me?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.887
Will you rap for me right now?
Oh, my God, rap for me.

10:53.921 --> 10:56.690
Rap for me.
This is a kindergarten beatbox.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.159
Throw down.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.961
* Look... *

11:00.994 --> 11:02.963
-I don't know.
-(laughs): Please.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.832
-Please.
-I don't know-- I know,
I'm sorry. I don't know.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.700
No, it's my job.
I-I don't ask you to come home

11:06.734 --> 11:08.135
and teach me things.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.171
Oh, you just asked me
if pork was beef.

11:11.204 --> 11:15.308
There are a lot of people that
don't know that distinction.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.178
Okay, can I at least know
the name of the song?

11:18.211 --> 11:21.014
"Girth."

11:21.048 --> 11:22.215
Hmm.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.318
*

11:25.352 --> 11:28.155
(line ringing)

11:28.188 --> 11:29.556
CAROL:
Hello, my sweetheart.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.324
-Hi, Mama. How are you?
-I'm good.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.861
I texted Ally yesterday.
She hasn't texted me back.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.863
-Hey, wait until we get
into the car.
-I was just wondering--

11:35.896 --> 11:37.564
-Don, I'm talking.
-I-I know,

11:37.597 --> 11:38.932
-but it has to switch over.
-I was...

11:38.966 --> 11:40.667
-DON: Can you hear us?
-I can hear you.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.870
I think he can hear us now.
Can you hear us?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.404
I'm not gonna beat
around the bush.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.406
I'm calling because I'm about
to access my bar mitzvah money

11:46.439 --> 11:47.674
and I thought you should know.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.910
-What?
-Oh, my God. What's wrong?

11:49.943 --> 11:51.678
DAVE:
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's great.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.346
I'm actually getting, like,
a very big rapper

11:53.380 --> 11:55.415
on one of my songs,
but to do that,

11:55.448 --> 11:57.885
I have to pay him his fee,
which is $10,000 in this case.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.519
$10,000?

11:59.552 --> 12:00.921
Are you crazy? What-- David,

12:00.954 --> 12:03.623
you haven't made a single dollar
off of this and now you want...

12:03.656 --> 12:05.292
How come we never talk
about the 15 million views

12:05.325 --> 12:06.693
that I've gotten
in three months, Mom?

12:06.726 --> 12:08.628
It's a huge accomplishment.
We never talk about that.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.697
But why can't you profit
off those views?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.266
Isn't there money
in the stream these days?

12:13.300 --> 12:14.634
It's called the cloud, Don.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.904
I can't profit off of it
because it's not my beat.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.371
It's just a beat I stole online.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.639
-So I can't even...
-You stole it?

12:19.672 --> 12:20.941
Wait a minute, what?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.910
-Did you steal it?
-DON: What did he steal?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.312
-He stole his--
his beat was stolen.
-He stole something?

12:25.345 --> 12:26.646
Oh. Oh, my God.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.648
Guys, it's not at all
how it sounds.

12:28.681 --> 12:31.051
It couldn't be more commonplace
in rap music for people

12:31.084 --> 12:32.585
to jump on other people's beats.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.821
DON:
You know, David,

12:33.854 --> 12:37.791
who is this rapper that
you are paying $10,000 to?

12:37.825 --> 12:39.259
YG.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.894
YG? I'm gonna look this up.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.629
-Do you-- do you have a pen?
-Is it-- is it

12:42.662 --> 12:45.332
"Why, G?" with a question mark?

12:45.365 --> 12:47.434
Or the-the letters "Y-G"?

12:47.467 --> 12:48.902
Google will answer
any question you have.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.570
I have to go.
I love you both.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.939
-Is it Korean?
-I mean...

12:51.972 --> 12:53.573
-It-- you know, it sounds...
-Like Wai Chi?

12:53.606 --> 12:54.674
Guys, I'm leaving right now.
I'm hanging up.

12:54.707 --> 12:55.775
-Is he...?
-Okay, but is it Korean?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.344
Is he a Korean rapper?

12:57.377 --> 13:00.280
Hello. Um, so I have
to wire $10,000

13:00.313 --> 13:03.817
to a company called
Blood Gang Entertainment LLC.

13:03.851 --> 13:07.921
Attention or whatever: Nutti.

13:07.955 --> 13:11.458
*

13:11.491 --> 13:13.660
Hold on, wait a minute.
Slow down.

13:13.693 --> 13:15.795
So YG is getting on "Girth"?

13:15.829 --> 13:17.364
Yeah.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.032
Just sent him all the money.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.333
-Is that your "Girth" dance?
-Totally official.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.468
Yeah, it's my "Girth" dance.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.937
We did it. We've done it.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.438
You think that's a good idea?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.673
It's probably the best idea
I've ever had.

13:26.706 --> 13:27.875
It's a complete no-brainer.

13:27.908 --> 13:31.211
-(ringtone playing)
-Oh, my...

13:31.244 --> 13:33.446
It's my boss. Dude,

13:33.480 --> 13:35.782
the market's been closed
for an hour now.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.617
I don't get any time off.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.886
Bring him everywhere, please.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.653
Like, he's a delight
to have around.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.956
Honestly, you will like him,
he's just high-strung right now

13:42.990 --> 13:44.824
'cause of his work.
He's a really good person.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.860
-(ball drops in cup)
-So you think YG,

13:46.894 --> 13:48.295
which stands for
"Young Gangster,"

13:48.328 --> 13:49.729
is going to get on a song

13:49.762 --> 13:51.398
rapping about the girth
of his dick?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.733
I got a seven, dude. (scoffs)

13:53.766 --> 13:56.336
"Girth" has so many
applications. What do you mean?

13:56.369 --> 13:59.039
The girth of his
girlfriend's breasts.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.308
The girth of his home--
I bet it's a huge home.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.911
No. Well, why can't you just rap
about normal things, like,

14:03.944 --> 14:05.312
I don't know,
getting head in the club

14:05.345 --> 14:07.547
and, like, having orgies
with your friends.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.848
Oh, yeah, I'll rap
about having orgies.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.417
I'll sound like the biggest
loser on planet Earth.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.153
You could always rap about,
like, the struggles

14:13.186 --> 14:15.923
of a young Jewish man.
(chuckles)

14:15.956 --> 14:18.058
You're gonna make fun of me
'cause I have no struggles?

14:18.091 --> 14:19.559
I literally met you
at overnight camp;

14:19.592 --> 14:20.860
your father is a dentist.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.896
And I'm not a rapper.
I'm a sound engineer.

14:22.930 --> 14:23.997
You're not gonna trick YG

14:24.031 --> 14:25.999
into rapping about the girthness
of his dick.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.200
There's no trick here.

14:27.234 --> 14:28.601
He's a businessman, bro.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.203
He sells shit at Barneys.
He's not an idiot.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.739
You know, I read the other day
that YG is actually vegan.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.207
Which shocked me.

14:34.241 --> 14:35.742
I would have expected
that guy to be

14:35.775 --> 14:37.677
fully carnivorous.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.912
-(ball clangs)
-(laughter)

14:59.332 --> 15:00.767
Hey.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.535
Can you please knock
when you walk in here?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.636
Did you tweet this?

15:04.671 --> 15:07.807
"Just got head." Yeah.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.276
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:09.309 --> 15:11.244
-What?
-Dave, my mom just called

15:11.278 --> 15:13.313
and asked why you're telling
everyone on Twitter

15:13.346 --> 15:15.115
that I gave you head.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.385
Well, I didn't say that
Ally Wernick gave me head.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.587
I was very nonspecific.
It just said, "Just got head."

15:20.620 --> 15:24.757
Oh, cool. Um, so who's
giving you head, then?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.961
Nobody, Al. It's fictitious
head. It's a joke.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.829
I'm happy to jump on the phone
with your mom

15:29.862 --> 15:31.598
and explain how Twitter works
and how

15:31.631 --> 15:33.233
everything that's tweeted isn't
a real thing necessarily.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.467
Oh, it's a very real thing

15:34.501 --> 15:38.238
that my very real principal
at my real job can read.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.073
You guys need to stop
thinking about this

15:40.107 --> 15:42.142
like it's Dave Burd's Twitter.
This is Lil Dicky tweeting.

15:42.175 --> 15:43.843
They are
totally different things.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.278
Okay, then explain to me
the difference,

15:45.312 --> 15:46.746
just so we're clear.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.281
Dave Burd takes your feelings
into account

15:48.315 --> 15:49.849
at every waking moment.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.452
Lil Dicky, on the other hand,
can never do that.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.188
I'm sorry. I can't worry
about what my girlfriend

15:55.222 --> 15:57.024
and her kindergarten class
are gonna think

15:57.057 --> 15:59.026
as I rap lyrics about, like,

15:59.059 --> 16:01.961
69-ing a girl on her period.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.431
I mean,
that's a terrible example.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.034
But think of me as, like,
a corporation.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.769
Like, when Wendy's tweets,
for example,

16:09.802 --> 16:12.472
I don't think anybody thinks
that it's actually Wendy.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.275
No! Because Wendy
is not a real person.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.510
Okay? And-and Wendy's
isn't tweeting

16:17.544 --> 16:20.213
that Wendy sucked
Dave Thomas's dick.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.117
Wendy is a real person,
it's Dave Thomas's daughter.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.885
-You're not gonna want
to hear that, but...
-Oh, my God.

16:25.918 --> 16:29.789
Okay. I-I don't want my mom
knowing that I give you head.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.291
You can wrap your brain
around that.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.825
Your mom knows you give me head.
My mom--

16:32.859 --> 16:34.561
everybody's giving
everybody head at our age.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.896
-I didn't give you head!
-I know, Al!

16:36.929 --> 16:38.565
That's my-- you're making
my point for me.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.200
I don't even know what
we're talking about here!

16:40.233 --> 16:43.236
*

16:46.239 --> 16:48.241
(door closes)

16:58.551 --> 17:02.021
I wired YG's manager
$10,000 today.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.093
I didn't tell you that yet.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.329
And as soon as I did that,

17:09.362 --> 17:12.399
he stopped responding to all
of my text messages, so...

17:12.432 --> 17:15.435
-$10,000?
-Yep.

17:15.468 --> 17:16.903
I have no idea
where the money is.

17:16.936 --> 17:18.205
I don't even know
who this guy is

17:18.238 --> 17:20.006
or even if he's a real person.
I've never met him.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.109
You've never met him?

17:22.142 --> 17:23.843
No.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.179
All I know about him is that
his name is Nutti.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.880
Oh, Dave.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.283
Al, I'm sorry
for being an asshole.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.718
I should never have said that.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.087
But I love you so much.
You're my moon, you're my rock,

17:34.121 --> 17:35.722
you're my favorite person
in the world.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.290
Tied with my parents.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.726
But I'm a wreck right now.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.428
I've never been more stressed
in my life.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.096
Before you came,
I was actually crying.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.098
-You were crying?
-Yes.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.070
Do you want a belly rub?

17:51.104 --> 17:53.240
Really? Yes.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.142
Oh, my God.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.446
(sighs)

18:01.481 --> 18:03.116
I'm putting the weight
of the world on you.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.752
-It's on me;
I need to get it off me.
-(laughing)

18:05.785 --> 18:07.254
*

18:09.856 --> 18:11.591
MIKE:
So let me get this straight.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.060
There were absolutely
no contracts at all?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.629
(scoffs)
No, there's no contracts

18:16.663 --> 18:18.898
at this phase-- it's laughable
you'd even suggest such a thing.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.800
Stupid guy over here.
I just work with people

18:20.833 --> 18:22.435
on Wall Street all the time.
I don't know about money

18:22.469 --> 18:23.936
or business
or any of that kind of stuff.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.605
It's a totally different world.
What are you talking about?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.940
Did you ever think for a second
that perhaps this guy

18:27.974 --> 18:30.277
who introduced you to Nutsi
maybe set you up

18:30.310 --> 18:31.644
just to take your money?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.746
Gata?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.082
Gata? That's a man's name?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.285
I didn't even think about that
as a possibility.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.320
Of course you didn't. Your brain
is basically pulled pork.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.021
Come on, dude, you got scammed.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.190
If I go and talk
to this guy Gata,

18:43.223 --> 18:44.291
-will you come with me?
-(scoffs)

18:44.324 --> 18:46.193
No. Why me?

18:46.226 --> 18:48.861
You were just lecturing him
about business and money.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.263
DAVE:
Mike, you're my best friend.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.199
I'm asking you to come, please.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.433
MIKE:
I love you.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.601
Take Ally.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.668
-Weekends are for me.
-No.

18:55.702 --> 18:56.969
You're a pussy. I'll go.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.672
Call a Lyft.
I don't give a fuck.

18:59.706 --> 19:00.940
DAVE:
I'm not gonna bring
my girlfriend

19:00.973 --> 19:02.509
with me to get the m--
it just feels like

19:02.542 --> 19:03.976
such a weird thing to do.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.545
I know that's sexist,
probably, but...

19:05.578 --> 19:07.113
-It is.
-It's even weirder

19:07.146 --> 19:08.515
to take me, 'cause then
it looks like you went

19:08.548 --> 19:10.550
and got your muscle, and they're
just gonna be like...

19:10.583 --> 19:11.784
You're the muscle?

19:11.818 --> 19:13.386
You're laughing at me?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.655
You have sex with a man
with no muscle on his body.

19:15.688 --> 19:16.656
That's bone and tendon.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.024
You're a marionette.
You know that.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.859
Okay, why do we need to go?
You just go.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.863
-Yeah.
-Y... you guys
haven't met this guy.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.032
You have no context. Never mind,
I'll figure something out.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.066
Dicky.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.868
Lil Dicky. Holy shit, man.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.738
-Hi.
-Hey. Gosh, can I get a pic?

19:31.771 --> 19:33.306
-Yeah, of course.
-MIKE: Definitely.

19:33.340 --> 19:36.509
Sweet. Um, you know, uh,
I'm a rapper, too.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.711
Um, I go by Nuance.

19:38.745 --> 19:39.746
Cool.

19:39.779 --> 19:40.847
-Nuance?
-Yeah.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.881
Send him all your stuff.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.149
You guys could collab
or something.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.317
-Three, two...
-(camera clicks)

19:44.351 --> 19:45.685
G-Get a few, just in case.

19:45.718 --> 19:46.819
-I got it.
-Very tight.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.521
Um, so, is this your girl?

19:48.555 --> 19:51.090
-(quietly): Still here.
-Yeah.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.659
I just think it's so sick
how you tweet after you, like,

19:52.692 --> 19:53.693
get head and shit.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.763
(Mike chuckling)

19:56.796 --> 19:57.764
You're my hero, man.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.899
(chuckling continues)

19:59.932 --> 20:02.402
I think that happens
to most couples.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.337
* Shots at your kickback *

20:04.371 --> 20:05.872
* Bitch, get back *

20:05.905 --> 20:08.174
* I said, bro, get back... *

20:08.207 --> 20:10.677
Thank you for coming with me.
I appreciate it.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.211
Yeah, of course.
Obviously, you know,

20:12.245 --> 20:15.615
you got to have me around
sometimes.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.116
What does that mean?

20:17.149 --> 20:20.052
It-it means that
we're in the hood

20:20.086 --> 20:21.754
and you had no other friends
to bring...

20:21.788 --> 20:23.923
Wait, this is the hood
right now?

20:23.956 --> 20:25.425
There's no line that defines,
like, "We're in the hood,"

20:25.458 --> 20:27.527
or a sign that says,
"Welcome to the hood."

20:27.560 --> 20:29.762
-But, like, we are in the janky.
-Right.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.799
Song with YG worked out, right?

20:32.832 --> 20:34.534
-(chuckles)
-Please stop.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.036
-Mr. Nuts took everything
from you.
-I need-- I need you-- I...

20:37.069 --> 20:39.306
-His name is Nutti.
-(laughs): Oh...

20:39.339 --> 20:41.274
-"His name is Nutti."
-And we're not even going

20:41.308 --> 20:42.709
to Nutti's house,
we're going to Gata's house.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.210
Oh! Gata!

20:44.243 --> 20:47.647
ELZ:
"Yeah, Mr. Gator, Mr. Nuts,
your 10:00 is here."

20:47.680 --> 20:49.282
-DAVE: Shut the fuck up.
-(laughing)

20:51.318 --> 20:54.287
Lil Dicky poppin' out
in South Central?

20:54.321 --> 20:56.222
-I can't believe this.
-Oh, is this South Central?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.624
Like Don't Be a Menace?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.258
Hey, you the engineer that be
at the studio, right, bro?

20:59.292 --> 21:00.893
-Yeah, papi, Elz.
-Papi?

21:00.927 --> 21:02.562
Man, save that gay shit
for New York, bro.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.631
-We on the west right now, cuh.
-Oh.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.299
I'm messing with you, man.
My uncle gay.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.301
And he a cold-ass nigga.
Come on in, y'all.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.269
Okay.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.639
-Hey, we got company.
-Hi. Catherine.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.173
Moms, we don't just got anybody
in the spot right now.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.274
We got Lil Dicky in here.

21:15.308 --> 21:17.344
He one of the best new rappers
in the game.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.646
Oh, what's up, Lil Dicky?

21:19.679 --> 21:20.947
Oh, no, I'm a normal person.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.949
That thing right there
is Lil Dicky.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.618
DAVE:
I'm the rapper,
isn't that funny?

21:25.652 --> 21:27.920
I'm Lil Dicky.
But call me Dave. I prefer that.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.022
Oh. Well, why you
call yourself Lil Dicky?

21:30.056 --> 21:31.458
You got a Lil Dicky?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.192
Soft, it's never even
grown at all,

21:33.225 --> 21:35.695
-since I was a child, but...
-Uh, mm-mm.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.830
No, it's just kind of like a...
play on a rap name.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.666
The opposite of
what you'd expect.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.468
So, you're a satirical rapper.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.036
Jackpot. See? I told you people
understand what I'm doing.

21:46.339 --> 21:49.776
Um... So, Gata, I have something
relatively serious

21:49.809 --> 21:52.211
I need to talk with you about.
Remember that guy Nutti

21:52.244 --> 21:54.280
-that you set me up with
for the YG verse?
-Mm-hmm.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.349
So, they said "yes"
to doing a song.

21:56.383 --> 21:58.284
I sent him $10,000.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.152
As soon as the money
went through,

22:00.186 --> 22:03.022
he completely stopped responding
to all my text messages.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.025
And the whole thing
feels very...

22:06.058 --> 22:08.060
-coincidental and...
-Wait, wait, wait.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.096
Coincidental how?

22:11.364 --> 22:14.901
You know, I have to assume
that my money's gone,

22:14.934 --> 22:17.837
and Gata set the whole thing up,
so I don't mean

22:17.870 --> 22:18.871
-to be accusing...
-Hold up, bro.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.573
Ain't nobody run off
with nothing, man.

22:20.607 --> 22:22.842
Nutti changed his number.
You got to kill that energy

22:22.875 --> 22:25.244
-in my house, though. For real.
-Nutti changed his
cell phone number?

22:25.277 --> 22:27.980
-That's what I just said.
-Who would change their number
in the middle of

22:28.014 --> 22:30.850
-a $10,000 wire exchange?
-I'm sending you his new line
right now. Relax.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.052
Okay, I'm gonna text him
right now.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.987
GATA:
Come on, bro,
you got me looking crazy.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.089
No, I wasn't saying that I was
certain it was you, by the way.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.358
I was just trying
to think about what happened

22:39.392 --> 22:42.328
and replaying everything and
thinking about who the suspects

22:42.361 --> 22:45.064
-could even be and...
-Oh, and you thought of my son.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.066
Gee, I wonder why that is.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.501
GATA:
Small things to a giant.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.069
I ain't even tripping,
this shit regular.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.939
People size me up all the time
and stereotype me.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.508
Putting me in a box like
I'm some thug. Just like you.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.445
You look like a nerd, all corny.
But you rap hard, though.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.179
Like, people play they self
when they do that shit, man.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.881
How you gonna do me like that?

23:04.283 --> 23:06.085
I hear you.

23:06.118 --> 23:09.756
And... it seems
I have made a fool of myself

23:09.789 --> 23:11.424
and I'm very sorry.

23:11.458 --> 23:14.393
-You should be.
-I know. And I'm...

23:14.427 --> 23:16.228
-(phone chimes)
-...embarrassed.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.798
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.
Nutti just responded.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.468
-Uh, he says if we go right now,
we can do the verse.
-YG in the studio right now?

23:21.501 --> 23:23.636
-Yeah.
-Oh, I got to go with you, bro.
We got to get this sorted out.

23:23.670 --> 23:25.271
-Please come. You'll come?
-Yeah, I'm going.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.080
-(hip-hop beat playing)
-What's up?

23:34.113 --> 23:35.782
(quiet chatter)

23:35.815 --> 23:37.049
Hi.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.150
Lil Dicky, remember?

23:38.184 --> 23:41.320
-Lil Dicky. What up, bro?
-(dog growling)

23:41.353 --> 23:43.490
-Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Balmain, down.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.992
-DAVE: Aah!
-Try to control your fear.
He can smell fear.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.326
-(growling)
-Control my fear?
How do I do that?

23:47.359 --> 23:48.394
-I reek of fear.
-(barking)

23:48.427 --> 23:49.829
-Just chill, man. Relax.
-(shouting)

23:49.862 --> 23:50.863
-Balmain.
-Ah!

23:53.299 --> 23:55.668
Damn, even the dog Balmain?
That's hard.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.571
-Yo, what you doing here, bro?
-Oh, man, you know me.
I'm just in here, chilling.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.640
You know what I'm saying, seeing
what's good. What's good, Nutti?

24:00.673 --> 24:03.442
-Nah, nah,
you got to skate, man.
-Bro, I'm the one that set this

24:03.476 --> 24:05.678
-whole little verse thing...
-Yeah, I don't
give a fuck, bruh.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.947
Hey, man, it's like...
Man, you being extra, too, man.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.516
-You burnt out, bro.
-(scoffs)

24:09.549 --> 24:11.951
Come on, man.

24:11.984 --> 24:13.085
Hate broke niggas.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.087
Shit make me nervous.
(sips drink)

24:15.121 --> 24:16.288
For sure.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.957
YG, Lil Dicky.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.692
What up, man?

24:19.726 --> 24:21.327
Good to meet you.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.762
So...

24:22.795 --> 24:25.131
I don't know what
Nutti has told you,

24:25.164 --> 24:27.433
but I've got this one song
called "Girth" that I really

24:27.466 --> 24:29.536
-think would be a huge...
-Hey, D, hey, hey.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.704
Turn the bass up, bro.

24:31.738 --> 24:34.841
* Beggars with dough, she fuck
it up, she know I got knots *

24:34.874 --> 24:37.176
* The money come, the money go,
man, this shit don't stop *

24:37.209 --> 24:39.546
* White Ferrecci 'cause she with
it, she a top-notch broad *

24:39.579 --> 24:40.880
* Steady lookin'
over my shoulder *

24:40.913 --> 24:42.549
* Man, this shit don't stop *

24:42.582 --> 24:44.551
* Tryin' to get that money
till this shit don't stop *

24:44.584 --> 24:47.620
* I'm tryin' to pull up foreign,
tryin' to pull up drop *

24:47.654 --> 24:49.656
* I'm buyin' all designer,
tryin' to hit your thot *

24:49.689 --> 24:52.391
* Ghetto YG, these Glocks,
tell 'em hit your block *

24:52.424 --> 24:54.994
* You see this old watch,
you see the diamond clock *

24:55.027 --> 24:57.564
* You see this a drop,
you know it cost a lot *

24:57.597 --> 25:00.166
* She see me, she gonna thot,
I see you, we gonna box *

25:00.199 --> 25:02.635
* Need to let my Eagle drop,
need to let my Eagle drop *

25:02.669 --> 25:05.171
* Yeah, yeah, I don't care,
war gear, I declare... *

25:05.204 --> 25:06.505
Guns! Wow.

25:06.539 --> 25:08.407
Could've used
a heads-up about that.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.409
-Lot of guns over here.
-(music stops)

25:10.442 --> 25:11.844
Oh.

25:11.878 --> 25:13.880
Sorry, I just noticed
all the weaponry.

25:13.913 --> 25:17.249
I didn't know
if something was afoot,

25:17.283 --> 25:18.551
or if the safeties were on,
or what.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.553
(snickering)

25:20.587 --> 25:22.021
Hey, 'Rell,
you know he a rapper?

25:22.054 --> 25:23.590
Thought he was a new intern.

25:23.623 --> 25:26.092
No, 'Rell.
You've got me all wrong.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.595
I'm actually
one of the best rappers alive.

25:28.628 --> 25:30.863
-(all scoffing)
-Yeah. And in five years,
you're gonna replay

25:30.897 --> 25:34.066
this entire moment and be like,
"Wow, not only was he right,

25:34.100 --> 25:36.669
"but I was so lucky to spend
that quality time with him

25:36.703 --> 25:38.504
before he really took off."

25:38.537 --> 25:41.774
That's what every rapper say.
The same shit.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.843
Well, every good rapper
has to feel that way.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.878
Do you want to pull up the
session that I want to work on

25:45.912 --> 25:47.914
-with you and see if
I'm just like every other...
-You be fucking black bitches,

25:47.947 --> 25:49.115
-Lil Dicky?
-(chuckles)

25:49.148 --> 25:51.083
You said,
"Do I fuck black bitches?"

25:51.117 --> 25:52.652
Do you fuck black bitches,
Lil Dicky?

25:53.786 --> 25:56.088
Well, statistically,
I certainly skew white.

25:56.122 --> 25:59.225
-(laughter)
-So, what kind of hos
you fuck with, then, Lil Dicky?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.293
What type of hos? Well,
you know, I've got a girlfriend.

26:01.327 --> 26:04.263
So, I typically fuck with her.
Fuck on her. All that.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.798
-(chuckling)
-Real cute girl.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.735
-Honestly,
the sex is very solid.
-(laughter)

26:08.768 --> 26:11.704
Uh, she has recently just
switched birth controls, though,

26:11.738 --> 26:15.107
-which-- her vagina
gets dryer faster, which...
-Damn.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.309
-I'm giving way too much
information.
-Bruh.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.045
-Her pussy really dry?
-(others groan)

26:19.078 --> 26:21.213
-Sometimes.
-Oh, yo.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.884
I will keep my ear to the pussy
the next time I'm in that ass,

26:24.917 --> 26:28.788
or... pussy, I guess,
'cause I've never done anal.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.623
-Don't think
I'd like it very much.
-(chuckles)

26:30.657 --> 26:32.458
Are you guys going to Coachella
this year or what?

26:32.491 --> 26:34.661
-(laughter)
-Hey, man. Hold up, man.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.629
I got to get you
on my Instagram, bruh.

26:36.663 --> 26:39.732
-Oh, is it a video or a picture?
-It's a video, bruh.
Spit some shit.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.101
-You funny as fuck.
Rap to the fans, Lil Dicky.
-(excited chatter)

26:42.134 --> 26:44.804
Oh, I don't know
about that, I don't...

26:44.837 --> 26:46.806
Spit some shit, Lil Dicky. Rap!

26:46.839 --> 26:47.940
You know, I'm really, I...

26:47.974 --> 26:49.676
wasn't prepared at all
for this type of thing.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.678
Don't film yet. Are you filming?
I don't, uh...

26:51.711 --> 26:54.480
-I don't know.
-Man, I thought this dude
was a rapper.

26:54.513 --> 26:57.449
Man, yo, Peter Parker's
scared to rap. Hey, D.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.418
Fuck it, man. Hey,
let's make a beat from scratch.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.820
Fuck this nigga.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.855
(playing drumbeat)

27:06.158 --> 27:07.426
Wait.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.762
(metronome beeping)

27:09.796 --> 27:12.765
* Allow me to tell y'all
what I'm 'bout *

27:12.799 --> 27:14.466
-(laughter)
-* Like a dinner,
you got reservations *

27:14.500 --> 27:16.335
* But I'm 'bout to eat up
all the doubt *

27:16.368 --> 27:18.671
* Hey, come on,
I'm a flower, let me sprout *

27:18.705 --> 27:20.439
* Lookin' like
I'm straight out of Comic-Con *

27:20.472 --> 27:21.841
* Scrawny Don, hungry, Ramadan *

27:21.874 --> 27:24.376
* My mama wrong,
she don't think I got a job *

27:24.410 --> 27:26.813
* But I'm-a make great cheese
like Parmesan, I'm hardly on *

27:26.846 --> 27:28.514
* But the rent paid *

27:28.547 --> 27:30.449
* 'Cause you know the pussy
flow good, I menstruate *

27:30.482 --> 27:32.218
* If we got off
on the wrong foot like Bengay *

27:32.251 --> 27:34.186
* It's because I'm higher
than a bitch, men's pay *

27:34.220 --> 27:36.288
* Rappers thinkin'
that they hot, blow your nose *

27:36.322 --> 27:38.657
* Motherfuckers, it's not,
I ain't never fought a man *

27:38.691 --> 27:40.693
* In my life,
I have only slept with *

27:40.727 --> 27:42.528
* Four different girls, still
you could get it, though *

27:42.561 --> 27:44.396
* Get every crevice, though,
come on some chicken *

27:44.430 --> 27:46.298
-* Like fresh mozzarella,
hella good Ebonics *
-(oohing)

27:46.332 --> 27:48.000
* I think like a comic,
my females got bombs *

27:48.034 --> 27:50.069
* On their body
like they were jihadists *

27:50.102 --> 27:53.339
* And my libido is scary like
Magic Johnson near mosquitoes *

27:53.372 --> 27:55.674
* Mm, I'm tactical,
I'm back and forth *

27:55.708 --> 27:57.744
* From actin' dull to rappin'
for you, attractin', lurin' *

27:57.777 --> 27:59.578
* The faction formin', the
track's recorded, it's about *

27:59.611 --> 28:01.247
* To put me on the racks
like a fashion store *

28:01.280 --> 28:02.815
* I just want a girl
let me hit it on a workday *

28:02.849 --> 28:04.650
* I don't think
my dick has grown at all *

28:04.683 --> 28:06.152
* Since the first grade,
I'm-a get the cake *

28:06.185 --> 28:07.553
* With my gifts
like a birthday *

28:07.586 --> 28:09.889
* Separatin' with my lines
like two lanes *

28:09.922 --> 28:11.690
* I don't want a Grammy, bro,
I got two *

28:11.724 --> 28:13.726
* And they're fairly old, stay
with more bars than a graph *

28:13.760 --> 28:15.661
* I'm on top of the class,
hop in a bath with a bad *

28:15.694 --> 28:17.930
* Little lady with ass, I'm
makin' her laugh, the neck *

28:17.964 --> 28:19.866
* Like a baby giraffe, shakin'
it fast, makin' it last *

28:19.899 --> 28:21.868
* Haters amass, sayin' I'm bad,
it's like an eighth grader *

28:21.901 --> 28:23.535
* Trainin' the class,
it's crazy and blasphemous *

28:23.569 --> 28:25.271
* I'm 'bout to break 'em
in half, I'm makin' my path *

28:25.304 --> 28:27.106
* I'm waitin' on my break like
a cast, somebody get a boy *

28:27.139 --> 28:28.875
* A gig,
he got drive and flash. *

28:28.908 --> 28:31.043
Like a flash drive.

28:31.077 --> 28:34.881
(all gasping, laughing)

28:34.914 --> 28:37.083
-He kind of tight. Yeah.
-Damn.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.185
Hey, Lil Dicky bitch,
if you listening,

28:39.218 --> 28:41.754
hit him
with that slickness tonight!

28:41.788 --> 28:43.956
-Oh-oh-oh. Uh...
-None of that dry shit.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.959
Don't take that birth control
till tomorrow, baby.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.360
-(laughter)
-DAVE: Did you post that
already?

28:48.394 --> 28:49.762
Please don't post that.
Did you post it?

28:49.796 --> 28:51.363
Yeah.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.099
-Oh.
-Hey, I'm tired, bro.

28:53.132 --> 28:55.367
-I'm going. Let's go.
-(laughing)

28:55.401 --> 28:57.103
Wait, where are you guys going?

28:57.136 --> 28:58.771
Oh, we got a quick Europe run.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.439
We'll be back in a few weeks.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.708
A few weeks? What do you mean?
What about the verse?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.276
Oh. Oh, nah, nah.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.112
We'll take care of that
when I get back.

29:06.145 --> 29:08.614
-Well, I would love
to settle up right now.
-Yo, yo, yo.

29:08.647 --> 29:09.816
Why you pressin' me, bro?

29:09.849 --> 29:12.251
I don't like that shit. Twin.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.552
DAVE:
Wait.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.254
Wait a minute.
Just... slow down. I don't--

29:15.287 --> 29:17.256
Are you gonna change your number
between now and then?

29:17.289 --> 29:19.658
I said I got you.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.293
W-Wait a minute. Hold on.

29:21.327 --> 29:23.562
Hold the phone.
Hold on, hold on.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.597
(engine rumbling)

29:27.533 --> 29:29.635
Yo, yo.

29:29.668 --> 29:32.504
Hey, man, uh, so, I paid

29:32.538 --> 29:35.274
you guys my life savings
to get on one of my songs,

29:35.307 --> 29:36.843
and we were supposed
to work on it tonight,

29:36.876 --> 29:38.244
and that did not happen.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.246
Damn, bro.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.580
My bad.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.816
-You know, I don't...
-Bro, don't trip.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.651
When I get back,
we gonna do something crazy.

29:45.684 --> 29:47.653
-A'ight?
-You promise?

29:47.686 --> 29:49.021
I got you.

29:49.055 --> 29:50.857
We good?

29:50.890 --> 29:52.324
Yeah, we're good.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.961
(sighs)

29:54.994 --> 29:57.396
(phone vibrating)

29:58.797 --> 30:00.266
(tires screech)

30:00.299 --> 30:02.301
(car departing)

30:06.705 --> 30:08.875
(sighs)

30:08.908 --> 30:12.144
Man, YG get a couple hits,
go all Hollywood.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.812
Had me out here
for an hour, bro.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.281
Did he do the verse or what?

30:15.314 --> 30:17.116
No, he didn't do the verse.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.986
He did put me on his Instagram
rapping for, like, two minutes.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.054
-He put you
on his Instagram rapping?
-Yeah, and it's going viral.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.056
-I can't believe that.
-Yeah, look.
-(Dave rapping on phone)

30:24.090 --> 30:26.392
Dang, that-- This is way sicker
than a verse.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.895
He basically directed
a music video for you, bro.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.397
Gata, I am incredibly high.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.831
Would you drive my car?

30:32.865 --> 30:34.400
I got you, bro. Let's wiggle.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.102
Okay.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.305
Hey, be honest with me.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.474
Were you just using me to get
into the studio with them?

30:42.508 --> 30:45.044
(scoffs) Man, you know I got
to do what I got to do, bro.

30:45.077 --> 30:47.479
-I'm a positive opportunist. You
know how I gander and wiggle.
-I know.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.481
We 'posed to be like Kobe and
Shaq, bro. I got to get mine.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.317
You 'posed to throw it
off the glass, bro. I rap, too.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.486
-Like, what's good? I ain't...
-No, I'm not mad. I...

30:54.520 --> 30:57.056
I'm honored to be a part of your
gander, as you would put it.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.224
I think it's cool.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.225
I think we're gonna be
telling this story at,

30:59.258 --> 31:00.259
like, our 50th birthday parties.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.593
50th birthday party?

31:01.627 --> 31:02.694
What's really good
with this weekend?

31:02.728 --> 31:04.931
-What's the plot, fool?
-(engine starts)

31:04.964 --> 31:07.033
I'm not doing anything
this weekend.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.767
I need to rest.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.938
* My dick sucks, my dick sucks *

31:11.971 --> 31:15.541
* My dick sucks, fuck! *

31:15.574 --> 31:19.045
* My dick sucks,
my dick sucks *

31:19.078 --> 31:21.747
* My dick sucks, fuck! *

31:21.780 --> 31:23.749
* Hey, girl, hey, girl *

31:23.782 --> 31:25.451
* Hey, girl, what you tryin'
to say, girl? *

31:25.484 --> 31:26.919
* When you see my dick,
you may hurl *

31:26.953 --> 31:28.620
* But I'm still kind of hot
like May, girl *

31:28.654 --> 31:30.356
* Whoa, girl, whoa, girl *

31:30.389 --> 31:31.857
* I'm just tryin'
to let you know, girl *

31:31.890 --> 31:33.459
* My dick sucks fo' sho', girl *

31:33.492 --> 31:34.961
* But I make up for that *

31:34.994 --> 31:36.562
* Like, even though my dick
is shorty *

31:36.595 --> 31:38.230
* It sit there like it's Gotti *

31:38.264 --> 31:39.798
* And it do good work
like Gandhi *

31:39.831 --> 31:41.934
* And it might grow more
like Brawny, probably not *

31:41.968 --> 31:45.071
* Got bitches in the lobby,
their body language obvi *

31:45.104 --> 31:47.974
* If five-inches the over-under,
I'm underdog like Rocky *

31:48.007 --> 31:49.641
* They don't care
about my cock *

31:49.675 --> 31:51.410
* I could use a pussy mop *

31:51.443 --> 31:53.045
* In the scene like I'm a prop *

31:53.079 --> 31:54.746
* She saw me and went in shock *

31:54.780 --> 31:56.815
* Technically
I'm unemployed... *

Do I just knock, or what?
What do you think?

32:14.933 --> 32:16.935
I feel like
they're not ever gonna...

32:18.870 --> 32:20.906
Why are you wearing
your sunglasses inside?

32:20.939 --> 32:23.509
Bro, you know I gotta drip, bro.
We're goin' to the studio
right now.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.178
Snack Time. I didn't--

32:26.212 --> 32:28.647
Okay. You're welcome.

32:29.982 --> 32:32.151
I feel like that did nothing
for my career.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.519
* Hi, I'm Dave *

32:41.360 --> 32:42.694
Oh, damn!

32:42.728 --> 32:44.063
(classical music playing)

32:54.973 --> 32:57.943
Do me a favor?
Never look me in the eye again.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.946
Okay? 'Cause your stare
is way too intense.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.748
It's starting to make
my hair fall out.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.657
MAN: This is your station.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.793
But... what am I
actually doing here?

33:14.826 --> 33:16.628
I'm not gonna tell you.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.065
Don't worry.
You're gonna figure it out.
