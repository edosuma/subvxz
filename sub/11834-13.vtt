00:00.967 --> 00:03.369
DOLE: <i>Previously</i>
<i>on "The Practice"...</i>

00:03.403 --> 00:05.506
His name is William Hinks.
He's a serial

00:05.539 --> 00:07.641
psycho head-chopper we just
successfully got acquitted.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.510
Now he's obsessed or something
with Lindsay.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.512
I just want you
to scare him.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.279
I'll take care of it, Bobby.

00:13.313 --> 00:16.617
The man you killed was a bit
of a security freak.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.752
He also managed
to activate his phone machine,

00:18.785 --> 00:20.787
which partially recorded
an exchange between you two.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.823
What exactly
do they have on tape?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.525
Me telling Hinks

00:24.558 --> 00:26.560
-that you sent me.
-I never sent you
to kill him.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.428
Look, we're in deep here.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.330
-Bobby Donnell?
-What's going on?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.265
You're under arrest
for the murder of William Hinks.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.134
MARTIN: The reason
for this assemblage --

00:34.167 --> 00:36.369
I do not want this one
slipping away.

00:36.402 --> 00:39.439
Robert Donnell is an enemy
to this department.

00:39.472 --> 00:41.207
They're giving Neel
manslaughter.

00:41.241 --> 00:42.676
In exchange for
his testimony against me.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.445
I'm bringing a motion
to kick a couple of counts,

00:45.478 --> 00:47.581
the most serious
being felony murder.

00:47.614 --> 00:50.751
Whether or not Mr. Donnell
actually did instruct Mr. Neel,

00:50.784 --> 00:54.320
that is a jury question.

00:54.354 --> 00:56.690
The defendant's motion to
dismiss the felony murder count

00:56.723 --> 00:58.592
is therefore denied.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.193
They've offered a plea --

01:00.226 --> 01:03.530
Aiding and abetting
a felonious assault.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.366
2 1/2 years,
one suspended, disbarment.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.668
Right.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.703
If you get convicted
of felony murder,

01:09.736 --> 01:11.404
you get life.

01:13.239 --> 01:18.679
There is no way
I'm pleading guilty.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.324
How did you know
I was here?

01:31.357 --> 01:34.661
You always
used to come here.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.330
Me too, for that matter.

01:37.363 --> 01:39.533
I remember,
what was it--

01:39.566 --> 01:41.668
10, 11 years ago,

01:41.702 --> 01:44.404
you and I sat
in this very room

01:44.437 --> 01:47.874
dreaming of the day we'd argue
before the supreme court.

01:49.676 --> 01:52.445
Listen...

01:52.478 --> 01:55.248
We talked about introducing
character evidence.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.183
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:57.217 --> 01:58.619
It'll open the door
on the drug bust

01:58.652 --> 02:00.721
where those police officers
got killed.

02:00.754 --> 02:04.290
I'm not missing anything,
am I?

02:04.324 --> 02:06.292
It's my word
against Neel's.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.427
He's a felon.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.562
What's his word?

02:09.596 --> 02:11.765
We got to be able
to make reasonable doubt.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.233
All they have
is a convicted felon

02:13.266 --> 02:14.768
with a huge motive to lie.

02:14.801 --> 02:19.573
The audiotape.
That precedes his motive.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.681
Can we win, Eugene?

02:27.714 --> 02:30.416
An outright acquittal?

02:30.450 --> 02:31.918
I don't know.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.855
The felony murder count --
All they have to prove

02:34.888 --> 02:36.857
is that you sent him there
to break in, Bobby.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.559
That's what scares me.

02:43.296 --> 02:46.733
Their offer
is still on the table.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.906
No.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.343
♪ (theme)

03:45.358 --> 03:47.894
The thing about Toomey --
He stays very neutral.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.495
He doesn't get emotional.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.031
Don't try pushing
any of his buttons.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.566
He hasn't got any.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.035
Don't figure him
to object too much, either.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.370
He doesn't need to preserve
something for appeal,

03:57.403 --> 03:59.573
he stays quiet.

03:59.606 --> 04:02.375
And juries tend to like him
because he seems objective.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.977
Great.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.612
We better get going.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.848
Good luck.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.352
Bags packed?

04:12.385 --> 04:13.854
Packed and ready.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.589
Um, Eugene,
I'm on call

04:15.622 --> 04:17.457
for my rape crisis center
today.

04:17.490 --> 04:19.325
Is that going to be okay?

04:19.358 --> 04:21.894
I thought you were just
in training.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.664
I thought you were
volunteering nights.

04:23.697 --> 04:24.765
I finished training
this weekend

04:24.798 --> 04:26.533
and I am
volunteering nights.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.669
This is a one-time thing.
A counselor got sick.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.937
Lucy, we need you
on call here.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.539
It's this one day only.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.040
I probably
won't even get called.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.909
-Come on, it's 8:30.
-Let's go.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.277
REBECCA: Bobby...

04:40.080 --> 04:41.782
I want to be there,
you know.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.350
So do I.

04:44.384 --> 04:45.686
EUGENE:
We can't have an army.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.087
If we sit in the gallery --

04:47.120 --> 04:48.789
Somebody's
got to earn money.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.558
I appreciate the support.

04:51.592 --> 04:53.760
Let's go.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.001
EUGENE: There's press
on the sixth floor.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.803
We just walk through it.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.605
I'll give you the advice
you give all your clients --

05:04.638 --> 05:06.673
Look humble,
but look like a winner.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.491
Thanks a lot, Mike.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.527
Bobby.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.561
We're friends.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.562
-Bobby --
-I said --

05:28.595 --> 05:30.496
Don't.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.571
You were first approached
by the defendant's wife?

05:37.604 --> 05:39.506
Yes, she came to us saying
she was being stalked

05:39.540 --> 05:40.941
by Mr. Hinks.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.943
-And what did you do?
-We arrested him.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.445
-And those charges
were dismissed?
-That's correct.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.480
Detective,
how many times

05:47.514 --> 05:50.050
did you detain or arrest
William Hinks at the request

05:50.083 --> 05:52.052
of the defendant
or the defendant's wife?

05:52.085 --> 05:53.720
I believe
it was three times.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.522
And for the record,
Detective,

05:55.556 --> 05:57.090
Bobby Donnell
and Lindsay Dole

05:57.123 --> 05:59.025
are friends of yours,
isn't that correct?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.461
We've always been
on friendly terms, yes.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.063
I imagine
it's not easy for you,

06:03.096 --> 06:05.165
sitting here today,
accusing your friend of murder.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.634
-Objection.
-Sustained.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.070
Could you describe
your last conversation

06:10.103 --> 06:12.806
with the defendant
regarding William Hinks?

06:12.839 --> 06:14.975
He was very upset.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.443
He and Lindsay
came to us saying

06:17.477 --> 06:19.412
Mr. Hinks was the driver
of the cab she was in.

06:19.445 --> 06:22.816
Both she and Bobby
were agitated and in fear.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.052
Bobby said something
like, "Get this guy."

06:26.086 --> 06:27.654
What was your response?

06:27.688 --> 06:29.656
I didn't know how to respond,
to be honest.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.025
-I was a little thrown.
-Why is that?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.628
The tenor wasn't
"Arrest him."

06:34.661 --> 06:36.530
It was "Get him."

06:36.563 --> 06:37.998
And by "Get him,"

06:38.031 --> 06:40.734
What did you
understand him to mean?

06:40.767 --> 06:42.536
I really wasn't sure.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.071
I just didn't read it
as "Arrest him."

06:45.105 --> 06:47.107
Thank you, Detective.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.480
-Well, what did you read it as?
-I wasn't sure.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.183
Are you in the business of
roughing people up, Detective?

06:57.217 --> 06:58.484
No.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.653
Killing them?

06:59.686 --> 07:00.754
No.

07:00.787 --> 07:01.922
Arresting them?

07:01.955 --> 07:04.024
I arrest people, yes.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.560
Yes. Well, couldn't
Mr. Donnell possibly
have been saying,

07:06.593 --> 07:07.961
"Do what you do"?

07:07.994 --> 07:09.963
I don't know, Eugene.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.833
Prior to this conversation,
had Mr. Donnell

07:12.866 --> 07:15.702
ever asked you to do
anything illegal, Detective?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.938
-No.
-So, it is possible, sir,

07:17.971 --> 07:20.574
that when he said
"Get this guy,"

07:20.607 --> 07:22.576
He meant "Arrest him."

07:22.609 --> 07:24.578
As I said,
I couldn't tell.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.213
You couldn't tell,
so it's possible.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.782
I suppose.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.617
And you described
Mr. Donnell

07:30.651 --> 07:32.218
as being agitated
when he said this,

07:32.252 --> 07:33.954
is that correct?

07:33.987 --> 07:37.157
-Yes.
-Well, his wife had just
been threatened again

07:37.190 --> 07:38.792
by a serial killer.

07:38.825 --> 07:41.261
He responded
by coming to the police

07:41.294 --> 07:43.597
and saying,
"Get this guy."

07:43.630 --> 07:46.199
Yes.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.802
I don't even know
why they called him.

07:48.835 --> 07:50.804
They called him
to bolster Neel.

07:50.837 --> 07:53.239
McGuire just made him
a little more believable,

07:53.273 --> 07:55.742
made the jury a little more
predisposed to believe him.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.678
And he's next,
right?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.046
He's next.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.648
(vibrating)

08:04.184 --> 08:06.820
Aren't you going
to get that?

08:06.853 --> 08:09.255
That's my rape center pager.

08:09.289 --> 08:12.192
Well, it seems
you have a call, Lucy.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.296
WOMAN (on P. A.): Dr. Davis,
telephone, please.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.600
Dr. Davis,
telephone, please.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.638
Lucy Hatcher?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.272
From the rape crisis center.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.174
I'm Caroline.
Treatment room 3.

08:28.208 --> 08:31.277
Name's Maddie Werner.
22 years old.

08:31.311 --> 08:32.779
Did the police
bring her in?

08:32.813 --> 08:33.980
I think so.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.280
There's trauma
to the face and neck,

08:35.315 --> 08:37.583
defensive wounds
on the hands.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.586
We haven't done
the pelvic yet.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.054
She's in there.

08:41.087 --> 08:43.123
I'll be in with the doc
in a few for the full exam.

08:44.991 --> 08:48.729
WOMAN (on P. A.):
Dr. Jay Hamilton,
Dr. Jay Hamilton.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.735
Hi, Maddie.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.138
My name's Lucy Hatcher.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.674
I'm a counselor
from the rape crisis center.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.843
I'm here
to help you through this.

09:05.912 --> 09:08.882
Is there anybody
that you'd like me to call?

09:08.915 --> 09:11.217
A friend
or a family member?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.722
So, when he gets here,

09:15.756 --> 09:18.091
the doctor's going to do
two things.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.994
First he's going to make sure
that you're okay --

09:21.027 --> 09:22.729
Medically okay --

09:22.763 --> 09:25.365
And -- And then, to help
the police catch this guy,

09:25.398 --> 09:27.968
he'll do
some evidence collection.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.238
You don't have to do
the rape kit

09:32.272 --> 09:34.274
if you don't want to...

09:43.750 --> 09:47.053
But it'll really help
if you ever want to prosecute.

09:54.695 --> 09:57.330
Can I get you anything?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.836
A blanket, maybe?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.204
No! No!

10:04.237 --> 10:05.739
No!

10:05.772 --> 10:07.107
No! (sobbing)

10:07.140 --> 10:08.875
I'm sorry.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.879
I'm so sorry.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.769
I've been a client for
about ten years or so.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.270
Though not lately
'cause, you know,

10:37.303 --> 10:39.239
I'd been law abiding.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.142
When did Mr. Donnell
last defend you, Mr. Neel?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.143
About eight years ago.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.244
The charges were?

10:44.277 --> 10:45.846
Double homicide.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.914
-You were acquitted?
-Yes, I was.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.049
Could you describe
for the court

10:49.082 --> 10:51.752
your relationship
with Mr. Donnell?

10:51.785 --> 10:53.153
Well, mainly lawyer-client,

10:53.186 --> 10:55.455
but I was
very indebted to him.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.424
You know, when you
allegedly kill people

10:58.458 --> 11:00.126
and get charged for it,

11:00.160 --> 11:01.995
the man who gives you back
your freedom --

11:03.897 --> 11:06.199
Well, I felt I owed him
my life, basically.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.969
Now, turning your attention
to the day of December 5th,

11:09.002 --> 11:10.436
Did you meet
with Mr. Donnell?

11:10.470 --> 11:12.372
Yes, I got a call
from his assistant

11:12.405 --> 11:14.174
saying there's
a big emergency

11:14.207 --> 11:15.876
and he needed to see me.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.178
-You went to his office.
-I did.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.046
Could you tell the court
what happened there?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.447
Well, he was upset.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.917
Told me he got married
and he had a problem.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.786
I figured he just wanted me
to kill his wife,

11:25.819 --> 11:27.721
but that wasn't it.

11:27.754 --> 11:30.323
He said this psycho
was threatening her,

11:30.356 --> 11:32.292
and that he could harm her,

11:32.325 --> 11:34.728
and he wanted me
to take care of him.

11:34.761 --> 11:36.329
And by "Take care of him,"

11:36.362 --> 11:38.331
What did you interpret that
to mean?

11:38.364 --> 11:40.066
Kill him.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.467
Kill him.

11:41.502 --> 11:43.069
Yes.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.039
Did you and Mr. Donnell
discuss a price?
$50,000.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.473
Did he pay you this money?

11:47.508 --> 11:50.376
Well, no. I figured
he was good for it.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.113
Did he indicate when he
wanted you to kill Mr. Hinks?

11:53.146 --> 11:56.116
Immediately, and he gave me
the guy's address.

11:56.149 --> 11:58.218
So what happened next,
Mr. Neel?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.954
Well, I went
to this Hinks guy's house,

12:00.987 --> 12:03.089
I broke in,
and I waited.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.893
When Hinks got there,
I...

12:06.927 --> 12:10.163
I cut his head off
and I put it in the freezer.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.971
I'd like to play for you
and audio tape

12:18.004 --> 12:22.408
that was recorded from within
William Hinks' house.

12:22.442 --> 12:26.012
NEEL: Bobby Donnell's
a friend of mine.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.914
That your voice, Mr. Neel?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.550
Yes.

12:29.583 --> 12:32.052
It's me and that Hinks
right before I killed him.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.055
I-I didn't know I was
being taped, of course.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.422
That was unfortunate.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.159
Of course.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.327
NEEL: We got kind of
an arrangement going.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.997
I kill people,
he gets me off.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.867
Over the years,
I'm in his debt pretty good,

12:46.900 --> 12:48.902
so when he calls in
a favor --

12:48.935 --> 12:50.270
HINKS:
I have a silent alarm.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.239
The police are on their way
as I speak.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.041
NEEL: Then I'd better not
waste time.

12:55.075 --> 12:57.177
HINKS:
Before you touch me,
you should know --

12:57.210 --> 12:58.945
I have cooties.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.581
NEEL: Oh, you're a funny boy.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.049
HINKS: Please --

13:03.083 --> 13:06.186
(choking)

13:06.219 --> 13:08.021
(beep)

13:08.054 --> 13:11.558
WOMAN: You have
exceeded the time allotted --

13:16.062 --> 13:18.364
Does this tape represent
an accurate account

13:18.398 --> 13:21.201
of the events
as they happened that night?

13:21.234 --> 13:25.038
Pretty much.

13:29.109 --> 13:31.444
Takes
some getting used to.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.214
You should have told me
it was your first.

13:34.247 --> 13:35.949
The doctor's almost ready
for the exam.

13:35.982 --> 13:36.983
You coming back in?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.252
Um...

13:39.285 --> 13:41.622
Look, tell me if I need
to call the crisis center,

13:41.655 --> 13:43.524
get another counselor
down here.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.327
Unh-unh. I'm okay.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.297
I don't mean to be brutal,

13:51.331 --> 13:52.398
but you're not going
to do her any good

13:52.432 --> 13:54.234
if you run
out of the room again.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.236
I'm fine.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.404
How old are you?

14:00.173 --> 14:01.407
Let's go.

14:03.544 --> 14:05.378
You made a deal
with the prosecution

14:05.411 --> 14:06.980
in exchange
for your testimony,

14:07.013 --> 14:08.048
didn't you, Mr. Neel?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.249
We covered that.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.384
Yes. It bears repeating

14:11.417 --> 14:14.921
because in all my years
as a criminal defense attorney,

14:14.955 --> 14:18.391
I've never seen a case
where a man goes to a house,

14:18.424 --> 14:22.896
breaks in, lies in wait,
decapitates his victim,

14:22.929 --> 14:24.430
then gets off
with manslaughter.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.132
Objection.
Sustained.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.602
They have you on videotape
entering Mr. Hinks' house,

14:28.635 --> 14:29.603
is that correct?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.171
It is.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.639
And we heard the audiotape
of you killing him?

14:32.673 --> 14:33.940
Yes.

14:33.974 --> 14:37.043
So, basically they had you.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.946
You were looking at murder,
life with no parole,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.014
weren't you, Mr. Neel?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.215
I know
what you're thinking.

14:42.248 --> 14:44.250
I'm fingering Bobby
to help myself.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.186
Why would I think that?

14:46.219 --> 14:48.021
Look, I'm telling
the truth here.

14:48.054 --> 14:52.626
How many times have you
been convicted of murder, sir?

14:52.659 --> 14:53.627
Convicted once.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.661
Armed robbery?

14:54.695 --> 14:56.162
I'm not sure.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.631
According to your record,
twice. Assault?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.165
Look, I didn't bring
my resumé.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.267
Three times.
Possession of drugs?

15:01.301 --> 15:02.969
I'm telling the truth
what happened that day.

15:03.003 --> 15:04.137
Rape?

15:04.170 --> 15:06.439
I still maintain
my innocence on that.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.074
-Perjury?
-Once, and that --

15:08.108 --> 15:12.112
Murder, rape, armed robbery,
assault, and perjury.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.181
Have we left out anything,
Mr. Neel?

15:16.983 --> 15:18.985
This deal you made
to get manslaughter,

15:19.019 --> 15:21.688
instead of spending
every day

15:21.722 --> 15:24.324
for the rest of your life
in prison,

15:24.357 --> 15:26.159
you're going
to get out again, aren't you?

15:26.192 --> 15:27.193
Look --

15:27.227 --> 15:29.129
I asked you
a question, sir.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.564
Under this deal,

15:30.597 --> 15:33.667
just by coming to court
and accusing Bobby Donnell,

15:33.700 --> 15:36.202
you get out again,
true or false?

15:36.236 --> 15:39.405
True.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.042
Thank you, Mr. Neel.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.210
Nothing further.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.356
Maddie, I need
to do the pelvic exam now,

15:56.389 --> 15:59.225
see if you have
any injuries, okay?

15:59.259 --> 16:01.061
I don't know.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.496
It's really important that we
make sure you're okay.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.065
Try to relax
your muscles.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.499
This won't be
too uncomfortable.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.535
Do you want
to hold my hand?

16:08.569 --> 16:11.271
I'm just going to put
my hand on your knees.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.508
Wait, wait.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.342
I'm sorry.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.378
Maybe we could get
a different doctor.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.581
I-I mean, can we still
get a female doctor?

16:20.614 --> 16:24.017
No. I can do it.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.386
I can do it.

16:26.419 --> 16:31.357
DOCTOR: Okay, I don't see
any signs of tearing.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.793
This is good.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.195
If you want,
I could...

16:35.228 --> 16:37.130
I just need to take
a couple of swabs,

16:37.163 --> 16:38.264
and we're done.

16:38.298 --> 16:43.403
Get... some cream.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.671
Lucy,

16:44.705 --> 16:46.673
go to the nurses' station,

16:46.707 --> 16:49.643
and what you want
to ask them for is sulfa cream.

16:51.612 --> 16:55.315
The sulfa cream,
would you get that for me?

17:05.826 --> 17:07.828
DOCTOR: All right,

17:07.861 --> 17:09.695
Caroline is going
to finish the rape kit,

17:09.730 --> 17:11.231
comb for pubic hairs

17:11.263 --> 17:14.601
and take scrapings
from under your fingernails.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.217
Okay, we have
a decision to make --

17:31.251 --> 17:33.186
Whether or not
you testify.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.155
What are you talking about?
How do I not testify?

17:35.188 --> 17:36.557
Well --

17:36.590 --> 17:38.725
I'm the only one
to refute Neel 's story.

17:38.759 --> 17:40.093
Bobby, if you get up there,
you'll be saying

17:40.126 --> 17:41.628
that you sent Alan Neel
to scare him,

17:41.662 --> 17:43.363
and under
the felony murder rule,

17:43.396 --> 17:44.731
that may be all
the prosecution needs.

17:44.765 --> 17:46.099
If we rest now,

17:46.132 --> 17:47.601
we could just
argue reasonable doubt.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.103
All the prosecution has to show
you sent him there at all

17:50.136 --> 17:51.738
is the word
of a convicted felon

17:51.772 --> 17:53.874
looking to avoid
a life sentence.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.209
The jury will assume
Bobby sent him there.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.243
Why else would they --

17:57.277 --> 17:58.278
An assumption
isn't proof.

17:58.311 --> 17:59.713
But if you say
you sent him...

17:59.746 --> 18:01.615
That is proof.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.855
Look, the question is
where do you stand now?

18:08.889 --> 18:10.423
Was Neel convincing?

18:10.456 --> 18:12.258
He wasn't terrible.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.360
Look, if Bobby
doesn't testify,

18:14.394 --> 18:17.163
how do we explain Neel
going to Hinks' house?

18:17.197 --> 18:18.498
What I'm saying --

18:18.532 --> 18:19.866
We may be handing them
their case.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.467
If Bobby says
he sent him,

18:21.502 --> 18:23.336
we remove reasonable doubt
on that issue.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.638
It could be case over.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.872
And what I'm saying is

18:25.906 --> 18:27.440
we've already lost
on that issue.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.676
Everybody in that courtroom
knows Bobby sent him.

18:29.710 --> 18:31.344
They don't know it,
Lindsay.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.346
Come on, Eugene.
If Bobby doesn't deny

18:33.379 --> 18:35.181
that he sent him there
to kill Hinks,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.883
which is what Neel
just testified to --

18:36.917 --> 18:39.185
Plus, I never said
break and enter,

18:39.219 --> 18:40.420
let's not forget that.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.462
He has to testify.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.164
He has to.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.766
Can I say something?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.769
It seems,
under the felony murder rule,

18:55.802 --> 18:56.937
you lose.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.939
The only way to win is,
basically,

18:58.972 --> 19:01.842
the jury has to want
to let you go.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.545
For that to happen,
you have to take the stand

19:04.578 --> 19:07.814
and say you never
sent the guy there to kill him.

19:07.848 --> 19:09.583
I agree.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.553
So do I.

19:21.795 --> 19:23.163
Okay.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.700
I'm testifying.

19:34.975 --> 19:36.843
Bobby Donnell is scheduled
to take the stand

19:36.877 --> 19:38.444
any second.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.847
He is likely to be
the only defense witness,

19:40.881 --> 19:43.283
which means this could
go to jury

19:43.316 --> 19:44.785
as early as tomorrow.

19:44.818 --> 19:46.820
In other news,
Governor Salucci was --

19:46.853 --> 19:49.690
Talk about
rush to judgment.

19:49.723 --> 19:51.925
Lucy, how did your thing go
at the clinic yesterday?

19:51.958 --> 19:53.560
Fine.

19:53.594 --> 19:55.662
Did you have a client?

19:55.696 --> 19:57.798
I'm not allowed
to talk about that.

19:57.831 --> 20:00.934
Not even
whether you had a client?

20:00.967 --> 20:02.669
No.

20:10.611 --> 20:12.846
Lindsay had become
increasingly scared,

20:12.879 --> 20:15.782
first when he started
showing up at the office...

20:15.816 --> 20:17.283
EUGENE:
William Hinks?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.285
Yes. He showed up
saying things like

20:19.319 --> 20:21.287
he wanted
to appeal his acquittal

20:21.321 --> 20:24.490
for the purpose of continuing
his relationship with Lindsay.

20:24.525 --> 20:25.692
Then he showed up asking

20:25.726 --> 20:27.493
if there was a good place
to walk a dog.

20:27.528 --> 20:30.263
All his victims,
he met them walking a dog.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.798
Did you respond to that?

20:31.832 --> 20:34.434
We called the police
and the district attorney.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.604
We got a restraining order
to keep him 1,000 feet away.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.606
Well, did that work?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.575
No. He showed up
where she gets coffee

20:41.608 --> 20:43.610
saying he didn't know
she'd be there.

20:43.644 --> 20:46.680
Then she hailed a cab.
He was in the cab, driving.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.781
He was stalking her.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.950
Did you tell this
to the police?

20:49.983 --> 20:51.752
They said
they couldn't prove it

20:51.785 --> 20:53.720
and there was nothing
they could do.

20:53.754 --> 20:55.889
What happened next?

20:55.922 --> 20:57.558
Next he murdered
his therapist.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.759
Objection.
There's no evidence.

20:58.792 --> 21:00.627
His therapist was murdered,

21:00.661 --> 21:02.629
who was also a friend
of Lindsay's.

21:02.663 --> 21:04.965
Then he showed up
at the hospital again

21:04.998 --> 21:06.600
to taunt Lindsay.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.769
Again, the police claimed
they couldn't prove it,

21:08.802 --> 21:10.871
so they let him go.
He's out there killing people.

21:10.904 --> 21:12.506
He's obsessed
with my wife --

21:12.539 --> 21:14.007
What did you do?

21:17.811 --> 21:19.713
I called Alan Neel.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.682
Why?

21:23.850 --> 21:26.352
Because...

21:26.386 --> 21:29.690
I needed somebody
who was capable

21:29.723 --> 21:31.457
of scaring Hinks.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.994
Hinks knew the police
were bound by rules and laws

21:34.027 --> 21:35.929
which he could manipulate.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.365
I wanted somebody
who didn't know those bounds,

21:39.399 --> 21:42.903
somebody who could
genuinely scare Hinks.

21:42.936 --> 21:45.539
That's why
I called Alan Neel.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.908
And you met
with Mr. Neel?

21:47.941 --> 21:49.676
I did.

21:49.710 --> 21:51.011
What did you say?

21:51.044 --> 21:54.047
I asked him to put
the fear of God in him.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.482
Did you ask him
to kill him?

21:56.517 --> 22:00.486
No. In fact,
I explicitly told him not to.

22:00.521 --> 22:02.556
Well, did you ask him
to physically hurt him?

22:02.589 --> 22:03.590
Never.

22:03.624 --> 22:05.058
I only asked him
to scare him,

22:05.091 --> 22:06.960
and that's all
he said he would do.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.395
Well, what happened then?

22:09.429 --> 22:11.131
I gave him Hinks' address,

22:11.164 --> 22:12.999
and he said
he would take care of it.

22:13.033 --> 22:14.968
Is it possible
Mr. Neel thought

22:15.001 --> 22:17.037
you wanted him
to kill William Hinks?

22:17.070 --> 22:18.905
No, because
he asked me that,

22:18.939 --> 22:21.041
and I said "I-I'm not
hiring you to kill him,

22:21.074 --> 22:22.509
just scare him."

22:22.543 --> 22:24.978
Isn't that a little risky,
Mr. Donnell,

22:25.011 --> 22:28.549
sending one of your clients
out to scare a serial killer?

22:28.582 --> 22:30.651
We had been to the police.

22:30.684 --> 22:33.720
We had been
to the district attorney.

22:33.754 --> 22:35.488
I had a wife
7 months pregnant.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.857
I didn't know what else --

22:43.429 --> 22:48.502
I got a psycho
obsessed with my wife,

22:48.535 --> 22:50.170
a man who chops off heads,

22:50.203 --> 22:54.508
a man who probably
just murdered his own doctor,

22:54.541 --> 22:58.879
who is now turning
all his attention to Lindsay.

22:58.912 --> 23:01.915
Was it risky
to send a man to confront him?

23:01.948 --> 23:04.084
Yes.

23:04.117 --> 23:07.053
But I was not going
to do nothing.

23:12.125 --> 23:13.560
That's my wife over there,

23:13.594 --> 23:16.763
carrying my child.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.002
I was not going
to do nothing...

23:25.005 --> 23:28.842
But I never, ever asked him
to kill anybody.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.224
Something obviously
didn't go well

23:44.257 --> 23:45.959
yesterday at the clinic.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.227
I can't discuss
cases, Rebecca.

23:47.260 --> 23:49.029
Rape counselor
privilege.

23:49.062 --> 23:51.765
I was talking
about you.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.467
How did it go
for you?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.870
I'm quitting.

23:56.903 --> 23:58.071
Why?

23:58.104 --> 24:00.173
I'm just not cut out
for it.

24:00.206 --> 24:03.644
Oh, and-- And you know this
after your very first day?

24:08.048 --> 24:10.483
I gave the victim
a blanket.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.485
And is that wrong?

24:12.519 --> 24:14.020
The first thing
they teach you,

24:14.054 --> 24:15.589
never approach a victim

24:15.622 --> 24:17.223
without getting
permission first,

24:17.257 --> 24:20.026
and I went at her
with an open blanket.

24:20.060 --> 24:21.494
She panicked.

24:21.528 --> 24:23.229
She totally panicked.

24:23.263 --> 24:25.031
Well, you won't
do that next time.

24:25.065 --> 24:27.200
There's not going to be
a next time.

24:27.233 --> 24:30.070
There are going
to be more victims.

24:32.573 --> 24:34.140
When I saw
what happened to her,

24:34.174 --> 24:36.577
I freaked.

24:36.610 --> 24:40.581
Lucy,
the woman was raped.

24:40.614 --> 24:42.683
So you got emotional.

24:42.716 --> 24:44.985
I would wonder about you
if you didn't.

24:45.018 --> 24:46.653
I ran out of the room,

24:46.687 --> 24:49.690
and then I threw up
in the hall.

24:51.291 --> 24:54.294
Did you go back in?

24:54.327 --> 24:56.196
Yeah.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.532
And?

24:58.565 --> 25:00.066
And I just wanted
to run out again.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.835
I mean, the only reason
I didn't

25:01.868 --> 25:03.036
was because the victim
grabbed my hand

25:03.069 --> 25:04.204
before I could.

25:04.237 --> 25:07.608
Lucy, this was
your very first call.

25:07.641 --> 25:08.975
I think you can
allow yourself --

25:09.009 --> 25:11.512
I'm just not
cut out for it, Rebecca.

25:13.747 --> 25:16.817
I bet you are.

25:24.257 --> 25:27.761
You know, I really
don't have any questions.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.730
As I understand
your testimony,

25:29.763 --> 25:31.965
you were afraid
of this Mr. Hinks.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.567
You called in a client

25:33.600 --> 25:35.702
you once got acquitted
for a double homicide.

25:35.736 --> 25:37.003
After your meeting,

25:37.037 --> 25:38.572
Mr. Neel went
to visit Mr. Hinks,

25:38.605 --> 25:40.974
and Mr. Hinks ended up
with his head in a freezer.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.277
I never sent
Alan Neel to kill him.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.112
He just got that idea
all by himself?

25:46.146 --> 25:47.614
I don't know.

25:47.648 --> 25:49.750
He either did,
or maybe there was a scuffle,

25:49.783 --> 25:51.351
I don't know.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.219
I do know I never
sent him there to kill him.

25:53.253 --> 25:54.788
So all you did

25:54.821 --> 25:56.623
was send a known killer
with instructions

25:56.657 --> 25:59.292
to be sure
not to kill this time.

25:59.325 --> 26:00.661
Yes.

26:00.694 --> 26:02.262
When you were first called

26:02.295 --> 26:04.665
to the scene of William Hinks'
house a month ago

26:04.698 --> 26:06.600
and you saw
his headless body,

26:06.633 --> 26:08.602
did you know
who had killed him?

26:08.635 --> 26:10.604
Yes.

26:10.637 --> 26:12.272
Did you tell your friend
Detective McGuire?

26:12.305 --> 26:13.273
No.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.641
Why not?

26:14.675 --> 26:16.910
There was certainly
no privilege here.

26:16.943 --> 26:20.146
Why didn't you tell the police
who had killed William Hinks?

26:20.180 --> 26:23.283
I was in shock.
I wasn't thinking well.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.886
So you were content to let
this killer stay at large,

26:25.919 --> 26:27.821
this killer who murders people
without being asked?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.189
Objection.

26:29.222 --> 26:32.893
Wasn't your real fear
incriminating yourself?

26:34.394 --> 26:36.129
Mr. Donnell,

26:36.162 --> 26:38.131
when you declined
to tell the police

26:38.164 --> 26:39.833
who had killed
William Hinks,

26:39.866 --> 26:43.336
was it because you didn't want
to incriminate yourself?

26:43.369 --> 26:46.640
Partly, maybe.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.041
Prior to the discovery

26:48.074 --> 26:49.776
of William Hinks'
decapitated body,

26:49.810 --> 26:50.944
had you told anybody

26:50.977 --> 26:52.679
you'd sent Mr. Neel
to visit him?

26:52.713 --> 26:53.680
No.

26:53.714 --> 26:55.015
None of your colleagues?

26:55.048 --> 26:56.016
No.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.283
Not even your wife?

26:57.317 --> 26:59.385
No.

26:59.419 --> 27:01.421
Mr. Donnell,
your wife is terrified.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.757
She's being stalked
by this serial killer.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.158
You didn't think
to tell her

27:05.191 --> 27:06.960
you'd sent somebody
to threaten him?

27:06.993 --> 27:09.195
You didn't try to give her
some peace of mind, Mr. Donnell?

27:09.229 --> 27:12.766
She was on the verge
of miscarrying.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.802
I didn't want her
any further involved.

27:15.836 --> 27:17.403
That's exactly
the case, isn't it?

27:17.437 --> 27:19.740
You didn't want her
any further involved.

27:19.773 --> 27:21.908
You were afraid
that by telling her the truth

27:21.942 --> 27:23.810
about what you'd
sent Alan Neel to do,

27:23.844 --> 27:26.046
you might incriminate her, too.
Isn't that right?

27:26.079 --> 27:29.382
I only sent him there
to threaten him.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.884
Yes.

27:30.917 --> 27:34.287
His ending up dead,

27:34.320 --> 27:35.989
just a big mix-up.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.783
What happened?

28:02.816 --> 28:04.217
It went okay.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.152
Bobby did pretty good
on direct.

28:06.186 --> 28:08.421
He was crossed all right,
but he held up.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.424
It did not
go okay, Eugene.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.493
It was --

28:13.527 --> 28:16.229
They just put
in their case uncontested

28:16.262 --> 28:18.699
while you just
sat on your hands and --

28:20.534 --> 28:22.268
Both of you.

28:22.302 --> 28:25.438
If nothing else, you should
have at least objected --

28:25.471 --> 28:27.107
There was nothing to --

28:27.140 --> 28:29.475
You do it to break up
their momentum, Ellenor.

28:29.510 --> 28:32.178
You don't just sit around

28:32.212 --> 28:35.215
and wait for something
objectionable before --

28:38.351 --> 28:42.255
It was like
you both went to sleep.

28:44.224 --> 28:47.794
I don't want to be
having this baby alone.

28:47.828 --> 28:51.064
I want him
in the room with me, Eugene.

29:19.392 --> 29:21.828
I thought
they were terrible.

29:21.862 --> 29:24.831
There was nothing
they could do, Lindsay.

29:26.900 --> 29:30.937
Toomey had an easy cross
because he had the facts.

29:33.473 --> 29:35.509
The truth hurts me.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.314
Let's face it,

29:41.347 --> 29:44.851
the line between my innocence
and guilt here

29:44.885 --> 29:46.286
is a thin one...

29:47.854 --> 29:50.524
And I probably crossed it.

30:02.068 --> 30:03.403
I would have so loved

30:03.436 --> 30:05.939
to have extended
that look of pain

30:05.972 --> 30:07.541
in their faces,

30:07.574 --> 30:09.409
that look of horror.

30:09.442 --> 30:11.444
It's a thing of beauty --

30:11.477 --> 30:14.280
The look on the face
of a woman

30:14.314 --> 30:17.317
who knows
she's about to die.

30:17.350 --> 30:18.952
FINLEY: You think
you'll kill again?

30:18.985 --> 30:20.020
Oh, yes.

30:20.053 --> 30:21.922
I'll get out of this,

30:21.955 --> 30:24.324
you just watch,

30:24.357 --> 30:29.329
and I'll know the joy
of that look again.

30:34.968 --> 30:37.037
That's what we
were dealing with --

30:37.070 --> 30:39.573
A psychotic man
who cut the heads off women,

30:39.606 --> 30:43.109
who pulled out their fingernails
and kept them as souvenirs,

30:43.143 --> 30:44.945
and the police
couldn't stop him.

30:44.978 --> 30:46.880
Even after they caught him,

30:46.913 --> 30:48.882
he was smart enough
to convince his therapist

30:48.915 --> 30:52.052
that he was a sick
serial-killer wannabe.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.987
She testified to that
at his trial,

30:54.020 --> 30:56.590
the jury bought it,
he got off,

30:56.623 --> 30:58.559
then he killed his therapist.

30:58.592 --> 31:02.228
And then
he turned his attention

31:02.262 --> 31:04.931
to his lawyer,
Lindsay Dole.

31:04.965 --> 31:06.667
Still the police
couldn't stop him.

31:06.700 --> 31:09.169
He'd show up at her office,
where she buys coffee.

31:09.202 --> 31:10.604
He picked her up in a cab.

31:10.637 --> 31:12.639
He gave her a dog,
then he strangled the dog.

31:12.673 --> 31:14.608
They got
a restraining order,

31:14.641 --> 31:16.109
but it didn't stop him.

31:16.142 --> 31:18.244
See, he wasn't threatened
by the courts.

31:18.278 --> 31:20.947
He could fool a jury.
He wasn't scared of the police.

31:20.981 --> 31:22.516
Why should he be?

31:22.549 --> 31:25.986
He killed 10 women,
everybody knew it,

31:26.019 --> 31:28.321
and he was still out there.

31:28.354 --> 31:31.291
I'll tell you
who was scared --

31:31.324 --> 31:33.560
Bobby Donnell.

31:33.594 --> 31:36.196
See, Lindsay Dole,
that's his wife,

31:36.229 --> 31:39.700
pregnant 7 months,
their first child.

31:39.733 --> 31:41.434
You don't think
this man was terrified?

31:41.467 --> 31:43.169
Would you be?

31:43.203 --> 31:46.272
A man who cuts off heads
is after your spouse.

31:46.306 --> 31:48.575
The police shake their heads,
"Nothing we can do."

31:48.609 --> 31:51.111
How would you react?

31:51.144 --> 31:53.279
How he reacted,

31:53.313 --> 31:55.081
he called an old client --

31:55.115 --> 31:56.983
Yes, a goon --

31:57.017 --> 31:58.585
To put the fear of God
in this Hinks

31:58.619 --> 32:00.353
'cause that's all
he could think of,

32:00.386 --> 32:01.522
try to scare the guy,

32:01.555 --> 32:03.690
and that's all
Bobby Donnell did,

32:03.724 --> 32:07.060
ladies and gentlemen,
that's all he did.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.062
He never said,
"Go kill him."

32:09.095 --> 32:11.031
That was a flat-out lie
told by a murderer

32:11.064 --> 32:13.366
with a rap sheet
longer than the Callahan tunnel,

32:13.399 --> 32:14.701
a murderer caught,

32:14.735 --> 32:18.071
a murderer trying
to avoid a life sentence.

32:18.104 --> 32:20.340
Alan Neel
flipped Bobby Donnell

32:20.373 --> 32:22.543
in exchange for manslaughter
and a shot at parole.

32:22.576 --> 32:27.213
The chief prosecutorial witness
is a murderer, a rapist,

32:27.247 --> 32:29.750
with a motive to lie,
and it's on his word alone

32:29.783 --> 32:32.619
that the district attorney
is asking you

32:32.653 --> 32:35.021
to believe Bobby Donnell
ordered a hit.

32:36.657 --> 32:40.093
Alan Neel's word doesn't
satisfy reasonable doubt,

32:40.126 --> 32:41.662
and I think you know that.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.778
Mr. Donnell
was scared.

32:57.811 --> 32:59.713
I don't dispute that.

32:59.746 --> 33:02.749
Who wouldn't be?

33:02.783 --> 33:06.386
The man on that videotape
after somebody you love?

33:06.419 --> 33:08.388
But being scared

33:08.421 --> 33:10.657
doesn't give you the right
to become a vigilante,

33:10.691 --> 33:13.660
it doesn't justify
breaking the law,

33:13.694 --> 33:15.796
and it doesn't
excuse murder,

33:15.829 --> 33:18.398
not for me,
not for you,

33:18.431 --> 33:21.367
and especially
not for Mr. Donnell.

33:21.401 --> 33:25.138
This is an experienced
criminal defense lawyer.

33:25.171 --> 33:26.507
He knows the law.

33:26.540 --> 33:28.675
He uses the law,
when it suits him,

33:28.709 --> 33:31.645
to make money defending people
like William Hinks,

33:31.678 --> 33:34.581
but the minute Mr. Donnell's
family is at risk,

33:34.615 --> 33:36.683
the minute Mr. Donnell
is scared,

33:36.717 --> 33:38.685
forget the law.

33:38.719 --> 33:41.187
He goes out
and hires a killer.

33:41.221 --> 33:43.757
That is not just hypocrisy,
ladies and gentlemen,

33:43.790 --> 33:46.560
that is the most knowing
and intentional criminal act

33:46.593 --> 33:48.094
you can imagine.

33:48.128 --> 33:51.497
Mr. Young says Alan Neel
had a motive to lie

33:51.532 --> 33:52.799
to spare himself
a life sentence.

33:52.833 --> 33:56.503
That might be true
after he was caught,

33:56.537 --> 33:57.771
but Alan Neel

33:57.804 --> 34:00.173
gave the same story
to William Hinks

34:00.206 --> 34:01.575
before he was caught,

34:01.608 --> 34:03.677
before there was
any such motive.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.378
You heard the tape.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.581
The clear inference was
he was sent by Mr. Donnell

34:08.614 --> 34:10.183
to kill Hinks.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.652
There was nothing self-serving
about that statement

34:12.686 --> 34:14.454
at the time it was made.

34:14.487 --> 34:17.658
Of course Mr. Donnell
sent Mr. Neel to kill Hinks.

34:17.690 --> 34:20.360
Why else would Alan Neel
have done so,

34:20.393 --> 34:22.495
for extra credit?

34:22.529 --> 34:23.764
Do we really think,

34:23.797 --> 34:25.831
"Oops, he must
have misunderstood"?

34:25.866 --> 34:29.735
A price of $50,000 was set.

34:29.770 --> 34:31.838
Bobby Donnell
was in that frame of mind

34:31.871 --> 34:33.639
when he asked
Detective McGuire

34:33.674 --> 34:35.475
to "Get this guy."

34:35.509 --> 34:37.377
He was in that same
state of mind

34:37.409 --> 34:39.112
when he dispatched
Alan Neel,

34:39.145 --> 34:40.681
and think about this --

34:40.714 --> 34:44.384
If Mr. Donnell is the innocent
man he claims to be,

34:44.417 --> 34:47.152
why, when the police
found Hinks dead,

34:47.187 --> 34:49.523
did he not tell them
who did it?

34:49.556 --> 34:53.126
Why didn't he tell
his own wife?

34:53.159 --> 34:55.696
Because he knew
he was guilty,

34:55.728 --> 34:57.598
and even if
for some reason,

34:57.631 --> 34:59.232
perhaps out of sympathy,

34:59.265 --> 35:01.234
you are to believe
Mr. Donnell,

35:01.267 --> 35:04.437
that he only sent Alan Neel
to scare Hinks,

35:04.470 --> 35:06.807
under the felony
murder rule,

35:06.840 --> 35:08.609
you still must convict.

35:08.642 --> 35:10.544
If you send a person

35:10.577 --> 35:12.546
to break
into somebody's home,

35:12.579 --> 35:15.448
and a murder results,
whether intended or not,

35:15.481 --> 35:17.518
the felony murder rule applies.

35:17.551 --> 35:20.687
The reason for this rule
is to deter suspects

35:20.721 --> 35:23.890
from doing something
so inherently dangerous

35:23.924 --> 35:26.627
that it could foreseeably
lead to violence,

35:26.660 --> 35:27.794
perhaps murder.

35:27.828 --> 35:30.731
Here, Mr. Donnell
sent a killer

35:30.764 --> 35:34.167
to break into the home
of a psycho.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.602
Think about that.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.472
It is no different

35:39.506 --> 35:41.908
than if he lit
the fuse of a bomb

35:41.942 --> 35:43.577
and threw it at Hinks.

35:43.610 --> 35:47.614
One way or another,
Hinks was going to die...

35:50.216 --> 35:54.855
And that's exactly
what Mr. Donnell wanted.

36:06.800 --> 36:08.702
The judge is
giving instructions.

36:08.735 --> 36:10.236
The jury will have it
within the hour.

36:16.743 --> 36:18.411
Maddie?

36:18.444 --> 36:20.246
Are you Lucy?

36:21.615 --> 36:23.784
Yeah.

36:23.817 --> 36:26.319
I didn't get that clear
a look at you before,

36:26.352 --> 36:28.354
and I know I'm supposed
to wait

36:28.388 --> 36:30.924
to see you
at the clinic, but I --

36:30.957 --> 36:34.628
Without your help...

36:38.364 --> 36:40.634
Thank you.

36:40.667 --> 36:43.269
Sure.

36:43.303 --> 36:47.240
Uh, I'm going to see you
at the clinic, right?

36:47.273 --> 36:49.576
I'll be there.

37:12.398 --> 37:14.835
(knock on door)

37:16.937 --> 37:18.572
Eugene?

37:21.341 --> 37:23.409
No.

37:25.045 --> 37:27.781
We're all lawyers here.

37:30.383 --> 37:31.985
The offer's on the table.

37:32.018 --> 37:34.387
Aiding and abetting
a felonious assault,

37:34.420 --> 37:35.556
2 1/2 years.

37:42.028 --> 37:43.964
Give us a second.

37:55.341 --> 37:57.611
I think
we should take it.

38:08.789 --> 38:11.291
Can I go take it,
Bobby?

38:17.363 --> 38:19.499
No.

38:19.533 --> 38:21.935
I just can't, Lindsay.

38:28.909 --> 38:30.877
Ellenor?

38:30.911 --> 38:32.679
I don't know, Bobby.

38:32.713 --> 38:36.049
I feel good
on murder one and conspiracy,

38:36.082 --> 38:39.753
but on felony murder
I--I just don't know.

38:48.595 --> 38:50.330
(knock on door)

38:51.932 --> 38:54.535
Look, we --
We need another minute.

38:54.568 --> 38:56.436
Well, we haven't got it.
The jury's back.

38:56.469 --> 38:59.005
They have a verdict,

38:59.039 --> 39:01.141
so either you
take the deal now

39:01.174 --> 39:03.944
or we go in there.

39:11.117 --> 39:13.620
We go in there.

40:00.734 --> 40:03.069
Mr. Donnell,
will you please rise?

40:08.108 --> 40:11.177
Mr. Foreman, have you
rendered a unanimous verdict?

40:11.211 --> 40:12.813
We have, your honor.

40:12.846 --> 40:14.047
What say you?

40:14.080 --> 40:17.584
"Commonwealth
vs. Robert Donnell --

40:17.618 --> 40:21.522
"On the count
of murder in the first degree,

40:21.555 --> 40:23.890
"We find the defendant
Robert Donnell

40:23.924 --> 40:27.561
"Not guilty.

40:27.594 --> 40:29.495
"On the count of conspiracy
to commit murder,

40:29.530 --> 40:32.766
"We find the defendant
Robert Donnell

40:32.799 --> 40:35.068
"Not guilty.

40:35.101 --> 40:37.938
"On the count
of felony murder,

40:37.971 --> 40:41.975
"We find the defendant
Robert Donnell...

40:42.008 --> 40:43.577
Not guilty."

40:45.912 --> 40:47.548
JUDGE: The jury is dismissed

40:47.581 --> 40:48.782
with the thanks
of the court.

40:48.815 --> 40:50.450
We're adjourned.

40:56.923 --> 40:58.258
Get me out of here.

40:58.291 --> 40:59.926
Come on.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.728
MAN: Mr. Donnell,
how do you feel?

41:01.762 --> 41:04.130
MAN #2: Did you ever
think you'd lose?

41:04.164 --> 41:06.567
MAN #3: Please, Bobby,
just one question.

41:06.600 --> 41:08.234
Will you continue
to practice law?

41:08.268 --> 41:09.970
Do you have
any comment?

41:10.003 --> 41:11.572
WOMAN: If you had it to do
all over again,

41:11.605 --> 41:13.473
what would you
do differently?

41:17.911 --> 41:20.747
That, uh...

41:20.781 --> 41:22.883
That went well.

41:32.158 --> 41:34.094
Oh, I knew he'd win.
I just had this feeling.

41:34.127 --> 41:35.295
I didn't.

41:35.328 --> 41:36.930
Did they say,
are they coming back here?

41:36.963 --> 41:38.632
Yeah. Oh, gosh.

41:38.665 --> 41:40.634
Well, I guess this means
we're back in business, huh?

41:40.667 --> 41:43.269
Which means you can go about
distributing that mail,

41:43.303 --> 41:44.270
if that's not
too much trouble.

41:44.304 --> 41:45.872
Funny. Oh, yeah, here.

41:45.906 --> 41:47.240
You can have that.

41:47.273 --> 41:49.009
What's this?

41:49.042 --> 41:51.612
Some cheapo recorder,
probably from a cheapo client.

41:51.645 --> 41:53.279
There wasn't a card
or anything.

41:53.313 --> 41:55.148
Huh. There's a cassette.

41:55.181 --> 41:56.950
Really?

41:56.983 --> 41:58.985
HINKS: Hello, Lindsay.

41:59.019 --> 42:00.854
If you're getting this,

42:00.887 --> 42:02.222
it's at the instructions
of my probate attorney,

42:02.255 --> 42:04.591
which means
I must be dead.

42:04.625 --> 42:08.128
That's unfortunate.

42:08.161 --> 42:11.698
I usually like
to have the last laugh.

42:11.732 --> 42:16.937
This is my little
insurance policy on that.

42:16.970 --> 42:18.839
See you soon.

42:18.872 --> 42:20.206
Get out!

42:20.240 --> 42:21.542
-What?
-Go!

42:44.197 --> 42:46.166
♪ (theme)

43:09.956 --> 43:11.758
You stinker!
