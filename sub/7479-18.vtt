00:01.068 --> 00:03.400
Previously on
NCIS: Los Angeles:

00:03.570 --> 00:07.166
- Who did this to you?
- His name is Abdul Habaza.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.740
Moe?

00:09.510 --> 00:12.343
Is this about taking down a terrorist,

00:12.513 --> 00:16.506
or about protecting Moe
because you feel responsible for him?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.618
When the time comes,
I will contact you.

00:18.819 --> 00:22.118
I will arrange for a passport so you
can leave the country, join our cause.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.851
That's Abdul's Overwatch signature.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.892
He just got off a plane in Sana'a.

00:28.062 --> 00:31.554
There will be a time and a place
for what you want.

00:31.732 --> 00:35.395
And I promise you, you'll have it.

01:20.881 --> 01:21.939
Shoot him.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.820
You're late.

02:00.988 --> 02:02.853
Too many margaritas
at happy hour last night?

02:03.023 --> 02:04.285
I don't drink margaritas.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.018
- Deeks is back today?
- So he said.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.661
You get carried away at yoga class?

02:10.030 --> 02:11.224
I don't do yoga.

02:11.432 --> 02:14.663
A big crowd at the farmer's market?
I know you do the farmer's market.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.232
The farmer's market is on Sunday.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.867
What did you do,
sleep through your alarm?

02:22.076 --> 02:23.737
Hetty parked in your space again.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.037
We talked about this.
You gotta be nice to her.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.477
Hetty did not park in my spot.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.082
I was checking on Deeks, okay?

02:31.018 --> 02:32.849
- Checking?
- Just watching his back.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.248
You were trying to catch him.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.087
The guy gets shot
because he doesn't alter his routine.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.749
I wanted to make sure he got
the memo on personal security.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.724
- Being this is his first day back and all.
- And?

02:42.897 --> 02:44.387
Got tired
of waiting for him to leave.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.726
I guess
he slept through his alarm clock.

02:46.901 --> 02:49.062
Better call him then.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.412
That's my bag.

03:05.085 --> 03:06.712
What the?

03:07.388 --> 03:09.219
That would be for me.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.525
- Marty Deeks.
- Hey, it's Kensi.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.093
- Hey.
- How'd your phone get in Sam's bag?

03:15.262 --> 03:18.459
I must have slipped it in there
while he was waiting in line for coffee.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.862
Medium triple, low fat,
hold the foam.

03:24.271 --> 03:27.468
You didn't follow me to the coffee
shop. I would have spotted you.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.131
I staked out the coffee shop.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.609
I go to three different coffee shops.
A different one each day.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.575
You've staked out
that same coffee shop

03:38.752 --> 03:40.811
every morning this week, didn't you?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.284
He did get his phone into your bag.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.290
- I would have seen him.
- But you didn't.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.792
You hear the shrill,
you know the drill.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.829
- Welcome back, partner.
- Thanks.

03:57.805 --> 04:01.536
- Who did you pay and how much?
- School kid, 20 bucks.

04:03.811 --> 04:06.803
Mr. Deeks, you've been missed.

04:06.981 --> 04:11.918
Mr. Hanna, your alias, Hakeem Fayed,
has been contacted via e-mail.

04:12.086 --> 04:16.182
It was sent to the address given to you
by Abdul Habaza

04:16.357 --> 04:18.257
before he fled to Yemen.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.154
- Eric?
- Sender is untraceable.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.694
No prior activity
on either e-mail account.

04:23.864 --> 04:27.800
Message consists of an address
in West Hollywood, a date and a time.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.698
Date is today. Time, this afternoon.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.532
Setting up a meeting.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.333
What's the latest on Abdul Habaza?

04:34.508 --> 04:37.671
We've been able to monitor
his movements since he left the U.S.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.279
He flew to Yemen via Egypt.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.110
He's been back for nearly a month and
has yet to leave the capital of Sana'a.

04:44.285 --> 04:49.222
It was our hope that Abdul Habaza
would lead us to his brother, Saadat,

04:49.390 --> 04:51.517
the leader of the Warriors for Islam.

04:51.692 --> 04:55.560
But as far as we've ascertained,
that hasn't yet happened.

04:55.729 --> 04:58.892
The Egyptian revolution
has made that entire region unstable.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.363
Saadat
is on a dozen different terrorist lists.

05:01.535 --> 05:04.129
He went underground
about 18 months ago,

05:04.305 --> 05:07.536
and believed to be hiding somewhere
in the south of the country.

05:07.708 --> 05:11.144
Now, cell phone intercepts suggest
that Abdul and Saadat

05:11.312 --> 05:14.247
may be planning a meeting
for sometime in the next two weeks.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.248
They also prove Saadat is still alive.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.318
Why do we keep losing the signal?

05:19.486 --> 05:22.580
The chemical marker Sam sprayed
on Abdul is breaking down.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.747
Narrow streets
in a built up area don't help,

05:24.925 --> 05:26.893
and it no longer works
when he's indoors.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.926
So how long
until we lose him completely?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.531
Several days. Week at the most.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.929
I need to take that meeting, Hetty.

05:34.134 --> 05:38.036
One step at a time, Mr. Hanna.
Don't lose sight of the bigger picture.

05:38.639 --> 05:43.167
Our prize is Saadat,
and not just his brother.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.836
So how do you wanna reply
to Abdul's e-mail?

06:02.663 --> 06:03.891
Comms check, Eric?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.555
- Loud and clear, Sam.
- What do we have, Eric?

06:06.734 --> 06:11.194
All right, address is a short-term rental
serviced apartment, cash transaction.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.203
- Guest's name is...
- Smith?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.638
Close. Jones.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.037
No relation.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.738
- Could be a meet, could be a trap.
- Could be anything.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.634
Door's unlocked. I'm going in.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.742
Anybody here?

07:03.023 --> 07:05.583
- G, got a body.
- Coming in.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.126
Wait, somebody might be
watching the apartment.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.870
It's clear.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.135
What do you got, Sam?

07:24.978 --> 07:26.775
Dead end.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.147
Maybe not.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.864
I got a fake passport
and a one-way ticket to Yemen.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.533
Business or coach?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.377
Coach.

08:10.322 --> 08:12.051
Dead guy was Freddie John Fanning.

08:12.224 --> 08:14.215
He served time in the '90s for forgery.

08:14.393 --> 08:18.090
The go-to guy if you need a new
identity and the paper to back it up.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.925
Preliminary forensics
puts time of death

08:20.099 --> 08:22.567
a couple of hours
before Sam arrived for his meeting.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.134
Single gunshot, back of the head.

08:24.703 --> 08:27.900
- Executed.
- After he delivered your fake passport.

08:28.073 --> 08:30.007
How did Fanning get your photo?

08:30.209 --> 08:33.508
It was taken when I was being
processed at Oakville Prison.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.441
Somebody might have supplied it,

08:35.614 --> 08:37.582
or he hacked
into the prison database himself.

08:37.750 --> 08:41.583
The question is, has your real identity
been compromised?

08:41.754 --> 08:44.917
A question we ask ourselves every
time we pretend to be somebody else.

08:45.090 --> 08:46.489
True.

08:46.659 --> 08:51.028
But this man Fanning
was a dealer in identities.

08:51.230 --> 08:55.166
And the last identity
he was dealing in was yours.

08:55.334 --> 08:57.268
Not mine, Hakeem Fayed.

08:58.137 --> 08:59.695
Abdul wants me in Yemen.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.364
In a few days time we'll lose him.
We lose him, we'll never get to Saadat.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.867
News out of Saudi Arabia.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.808
Warriors for Islam
is demanding the release

09:07.980 --> 09:10.676
of a dozen al Qaeda members
imprisoned in Riyadh...

09:12.551 --> 09:16.282
In exchange for a Saudi hostage
that they took seven days ago.

09:16.455 --> 09:20.152
Saudis don't negotiate with terrorists.
That hostage is as good as dead.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.294
The hostage is 7 years old.

09:24.063 --> 09:28.056
He's the son of a Saudi prince,
who's a close confidant with the king.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.564
It's started, Hetty.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.669
Warriors for Islam
is trying to put itself on the map.

09:32.838 --> 09:37.036
And we received an e-mail.
Or, at least, Hakeem Fayed did.

09:37.209 --> 09:40.804
It's the name of a hotel
in the capital Sana'a.

09:40.980 --> 09:44.040
The Blue Oasis.
They're holding a room for Hakeem.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.521
E-mail them back.

09:51.590 --> 09:54.081
Thank them for their hospitality.

09:56.862 --> 10:00.229
Tell them that Hakeem
is on his way.

10:00.899 --> 10:02.594
Mr. Callen will go as backup.

10:02.801 --> 10:06.897
I'll shift assets in the region to Yemen
for additional support.

10:07.072 --> 10:10.064
Miss Blye and Mr. Deeks
can focus on finding out

10:10.242 --> 10:13.803
if Mr. Hanna's identity
has been compromised.

10:19.752 --> 10:23.779
Mr. Hanna,
any evidence, no matter how slight,

10:23.956 --> 10:26.015
that suggests
that your cover's been blown

10:26.191 --> 10:30.218
and I want you out of there
on the next possible flight.

10:30.396 --> 10:31.624
Understood?

10:32.097 --> 10:33.962
Understood.

10:48.714 --> 10:50.705
- Director Vance, please.
- Yes?

10:51.250 --> 10:54.151
- Leon, it's Hetty.
- Yes, Henrietta.

10:54.353 --> 10:57.584
Are we still on speaking terms
with that fellow from the CIA

10:57.756 --> 11:00.224
who runs operations in Yemen?

11:00.392 --> 11:02.223
Yes, we are.

11:02.394 --> 11:05.329
Then you should send him
a bottle of bourbon.

11:05.497 --> 11:08.398
- I think we're going to need him.
- Consider it done.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.634
Confirmed your alias, Mr. Callen?

11:17.776 --> 11:19.243
Ray Haymes.

11:19.411 --> 11:22.005
A textile buyer
for a department store chain.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.617
Ooh. Maybe you can bring me back
a nice futah.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.185
And Sam.

11:29.955 --> 11:31.286
All set.

11:31.457 --> 11:32.685
Is he?

11:36.929 --> 11:38.829
You'd prefer to send someone else.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.593
You wouldn't?

11:46.138 --> 11:49.164
Sam will do what needs to be done.

11:49.641 --> 11:52.838
And nothing more, Mr. Callen.

11:53.011 --> 11:55.377
And if necessary, much less.

11:55.547 --> 12:00.109
I need to know that he can walk away,
if that's what's required.

12:00.285 --> 12:03.186
This is not about
avenging Moe's death.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.153
I know that.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.855
Well, please make sure
that he does.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.299
Bright colors, Mr. Callen.

12:20.005 --> 12:21.438
The futah.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.567
Reservations? Hakeem Fayed.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.605
Of course. Just one second, sir.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.440
Single room for one night.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.979
- Is that correct, Mr. Fayed?
- Guess so.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.707
If you don't mind, please,

13:38.884 --> 13:43.116
be so kind as to fill
all the details out here, please.

13:43.555 --> 13:47.616
- Hey, my room key, please, 409.
- Of course, Mr. Haymes.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.054
Here you go.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.722
It will be room 615.

13:55.767 --> 13:59.498
By the way, this was left for you, sir.
Thank you.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.951
This was left for me.

14:23.328 --> 14:24.693
Anyone in the foyer?

14:24.863 --> 14:28.162
The busboy's on someone's payroll.
He didn't miss a beat.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.096
Guess Abdul knows I've checked in.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.635
There's a number to call,
probably a burn cell phone.

14:35.007 --> 14:37.134
I'll give it to Eric.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.337
GPS tracking device.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.880
Turn it on when you're moving.

14:43.081 --> 14:46.983
Three clicks if you need me.
I'll only ever be two minutes away.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.217
- How long is the room booked for?
- One night.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.383
He's gonna move you.

15:02.834 --> 15:07.032
- Take it easy, Sam.
- You too.

15:38.937 --> 15:42.532
So how does it feel
to be Hetty's asset in Yemen?

15:46.411 --> 15:48.242
Dangerous.

16:04.895 --> 16:08.262
Hetty had me back in Yemen
within a week of Abdul arriving.

16:08.432 --> 16:10.127
Got some contacts here.

16:10.301 --> 16:12.394
People inside the government
who know a little more

16:12.570 --> 16:14.800
than they're letting on
about the Warriors of Islam.

16:14.972 --> 16:16.439
They've been feeding me the intel.

16:18.375 --> 16:21.742
- Where did you get the hardware?
- Don't ask.

16:24.982 --> 16:28.679
- Got an uplink yet?
- It's coming online right now.

16:29.987 --> 16:31.511
Send that to Eric.

16:31.689 --> 16:34.180
It's the contact number
Abdul left for Sam.

16:34.658 --> 16:36.626
Tell me about
the boy they're holding hostage?

16:36.794 --> 16:38.193
They chose him well.

16:38.395 --> 16:41.887
He's the only son of one of the most
powerful princes in Saudi government.

16:42.099 --> 16:43.589
And he was kidnapped
over a week ago,

16:43.767 --> 16:46.668
but they only went public
with the abduction yesterday.

16:47.805 --> 16:49.966
It's possible
that the father kept the news quiet

16:50.140 --> 16:52.335
to try to negotiate privately
with the terrorists.

16:52.509 --> 16:55.307
But the government
won't give in to their demands.

16:55.479 --> 16:57.447
Contacts on the ground
think Saadat's behind it?

16:57.615 --> 16:59.947
Nothing happens
without Saadat's approval,

17:00.117 --> 17:02.142
but it's more likely
Abdul planned this.

17:02.353 --> 17:04.617
And you're sure
they haven't linked forces yet?

17:04.788 --> 17:07.882
Sure as I can be. Abdul
hasn't left the city since he arrived.

17:08.058 --> 17:11.117
And my sources are confident
that if Saadat had met with him,

17:11.295 --> 17:13.194
they'd have heard about it.

17:15.699 --> 17:16.961
You okay?

17:17.166 --> 17:19.192
Abdul thinks I'm dead.

17:19.369 --> 17:23.204
Chances of me running into him
are negligible, but we can't risk it.

17:23.374 --> 17:26.172
I only move around at night,
stay out of sight during the day.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.367
Which means

17:29.046 --> 17:30.638
you're on the lunch run.

17:45.663 --> 17:47.927
Assalamu alaikum, Hakeem.

17:48.098 --> 17:49.895
Walaikum assalam, Abdul.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.900
Welcome, my friend.
Is everything well?

17:53.103 --> 17:55.367
Everything's great.
I'm excited to be here.

17:55.539 --> 17:56.836
As I am, Hakeem.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.909
So when can we meet?

18:03.480 --> 18:06.506
We could meet now, Hakeem.

18:15.793 --> 18:17.590
Good to see you.

18:18.729 --> 18:21.254
You had no problems
leaving America?

18:21.432 --> 18:24.265
Well, the guy I collected
my paperwork from was dead.

18:24.501 --> 18:26.731
Yes, well,
he demanded more money.

18:26.904 --> 18:29.930
Threatened to withhold your papers.
He left us no choice.

18:35.879 --> 18:38.905
Welcome to the cause, brother.

18:40.217 --> 18:42.082
So, what's the plans for me?

18:43.120 --> 18:45.816
Well, to begin with,
there is no need to unpack.

18:46.023 --> 18:47.115
We're leaving right now.

18:47.791 --> 18:49.952
Going where? Another hotel?

18:53.297 --> 18:55.561
You must be patient, Hakeem.

18:55.766 --> 18:59.167
In time, Allah reveals everything.

19:02.806 --> 19:06.071
Get your things.
I have a car waiting.

19:07.544 --> 19:10.069
We have a long way to drive.

19:11.448 --> 19:12.938
Ready?

19:13.851 --> 19:15.284
Let's go.

19:20.758 --> 19:22.089
Sam's on the move.

19:22.292 --> 19:25.159
- Abdul must have contacted him.
- He would've warned you if he could.

19:25.329 --> 19:27.126
- Someone must be with him.
- Car?

19:27.297 --> 19:29.697
Light brown SUV
in the alley behind the hotel.

19:29.933 --> 19:31.764
Tell Eric.

21:17.574 --> 21:18.598
Talk to me, Eric.

21:18.775 --> 21:20.367
Sam's GPS is coming online now.

21:20.577 --> 21:24.809
Your sat phone GPS puts you
three and a half miles behind him.

21:25.048 --> 21:26.982
They're headed south
on Taizz Road.

21:27.217 --> 21:29.777
- You're gonna have to close the gap.
- I'm working on that.

21:31.054 --> 21:33.420
Callen, Abdul is with him.

21:33.624 --> 21:36.149
I know. Had a little problem
with one of Abdul's guys.

21:36.326 --> 21:38.556
Has Sam been compromised,
Mr. Callen?

21:38.729 --> 21:39.957
No, I don't think so.

21:40.197 --> 21:43.633
He's a hotel employee.
He didn't have time to warn Abdul.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.461
I'm bringing the body with me.

21:45.702 --> 21:49.934
- Eric, don't lose him.
- Trying not to.

21:50.774 --> 21:52.708
They're heading south
out of the city.

21:52.910 --> 21:55.344
Saadat's rumored hiding out
in the south of the country.

21:55.579 --> 21:58.104
Maybe Abdul's finally
going to meet his brother.

21:58.282 --> 21:59.749
And he's bringing Sam with him.

21:59.950 --> 22:02.748
It's not all bad then.

22:10.928 --> 22:12.828
We headed south?

22:13.530 --> 22:17.022
Why are you so interested in what
direction we're travelling, Hakeem?

22:17.234 --> 22:20.169
I'm trying to ascertain
the direction of Mecca.

22:21.305 --> 22:23.239
It's time for noon prayer, brother.

22:45.062 --> 22:50.193
A short pilgrimage to Mecca across
the border into Saudi Arabia, Hakeem?

22:50.367 --> 22:52.665
One day soon, maybe.

22:55.372 --> 23:00.139
You must be pleased
to be back in Yemen, see your family.

23:01.211 --> 23:03.372
You told me in prison
you had a brother.

23:03.547 --> 23:05.344
Saadat.

23:05.515 --> 23:07.710
He is with me wherever I travel.

23:10.587 --> 23:12.885
You're very proud of him.

23:15.392 --> 23:18.156
My brother is a leader of men,
Hakeem.

23:18.328 --> 23:22.059
When you meet him you'll understand
why our cause cannot fail.

23:23.900 --> 23:27.233
We are putting into play a plan

23:27.804 --> 23:31.934
that will show the West the true power
of the Warriors for Islam.

23:33.810 --> 23:36.404
That great day will come very soon.

23:52.829 --> 23:54.353
Re-establish contact, Eric.

23:54.564 --> 23:56.759
- I'm gonna stay two minutes ahead.
- Copy that.

23:56.967 --> 23:58.229
Callen's back in the game.

24:07.711 --> 24:09.474
Stop the car.

24:10.347 --> 24:12.212
Hakeem, grab the boy.

24:41.912 --> 24:43.607
Shoot him.

24:58.995 --> 25:01.020
If you want me to do this, then,

25:01.198 --> 25:03.598
you should trust me
and give me a loaded weapon.

25:09.439 --> 25:13.136
- You test me, Abdul?
- I test everybody, Hakeem.

25:15.212 --> 25:17.203
You passed.

25:25.522 --> 25:26.853
He failed.

25:28.925 --> 25:32.452
Let this be a lesson to all of you,
of the importance of this boy.

25:41.438 --> 25:43.030
He is now in your charge, Hakeem.

25:45.675 --> 25:47.836
Guard him with your life.

26:31.486 --> 26:34.649
- Where is the boy?
- He's with Rafiq.

26:34.823 --> 26:36.984
I came to get him some food.

26:38.393 --> 26:40.588
What makes this boy so valuable?

26:40.796 --> 26:42.593
He is the son of a Saudi prince.

26:42.798 --> 26:45.665
There are a lot of Saudi princes.
They count them by the thousands.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.324
That's true.

26:47.502 --> 26:51.131
But this one is a favorite.
As is his father.

26:52.274 --> 26:53.468
Holding him for ransom?

26:54.109 --> 26:56.907
No, Hakeem, not for ransom.

26:57.412 --> 26:59.539
A prisoner exchange?

27:01.550 --> 27:03.142
No.

27:23.805 --> 27:25.466
Why then?

27:26.675 --> 27:30.577
You'll see, Hakeem. Very soon.

27:31.580 --> 27:33.639
Go back to the boy.

27:33.815 --> 27:37.581
Take him his food.
Do not leave his side.

27:38.086 --> 27:40.350
You said the world would soon learn

27:40.522 --> 27:43.320
how powerful
the Warriors for Islam really are.

27:45.260 --> 27:50.493
You think we measure the power
of our cause by the life of a small boy?

27:51.667 --> 27:53.032
Then tell me why.

27:54.736 --> 27:56.203
Soon, my brother.

28:36.044 --> 28:37.944
You're Amir.

28:42.651 --> 28:44.084
Listen, Amir.

28:45.654 --> 28:49.090
I won't hurt you and I won't let anybody
else hurt you, you understand?

28:55.797 --> 28:57.662
Soup and bread.

29:04.272 --> 29:06.297
If you don't eat it, I will.

29:09.444 --> 29:12.413
It's good. Mm.

29:18.854 --> 29:20.685
Exactly.

29:34.836 --> 29:40.069
If anything happens, I want you
to stay by my side, you understand?

29:42.611 --> 29:44.078
Good.

29:53.588 --> 29:56.113
- Keeping warm?
- Barely.

29:56.291 --> 29:59.624
They've posted guards.
I'm counting five guys, could be more.

30:00.195 --> 30:02.720
Mr. Callen,
can you confirm Mr. Hanna?

30:02.964 --> 30:05.728
- Confirmed, Abdul's with him.
- Saadat?

30:05.967 --> 30:08.401
Not yet, but it seems
they're waiting for something.

30:09.404 --> 30:10.462
Or someone.

30:10.672 --> 30:13.163
The minute you can confirm
Saadat's presence,

30:13.341 --> 30:16.174
I want the two of you
out of harm's way.

30:16.378 --> 30:18.175
The boy is here, Hetty.

30:18.346 --> 30:20.337
Your primary mission, Mr. Callen,

30:20.549 --> 30:23.416
is to confirm
that Saadat has joined his brother.

30:23.652 --> 30:26.644
Not leaving without the boy.

30:30.725 --> 30:34.559
Freddie John Fanning... Hmm.

30:36.064 --> 30:37.361
We're missing something.

30:37.566 --> 30:39.659
- A suspect.
- A murder weapon.

30:39.868 --> 30:42.200
And witnesses, don't forget witnesses,
we're missing them.

30:42.370 --> 30:44.600
Witnesses can be very valuable,
you know.

30:44.773 --> 30:47.571
Maybe even tell us
if Sam's been compromised.

30:48.643 --> 30:50.235
And evidence.

30:50.445 --> 30:52.413
And a clue.

30:52.581 --> 30:54.378
A clue would be good too.

30:58.253 --> 30:59.584
What we know.

30:59.754 --> 31:02.780
- Fanning is hired to forge a passport.
- Check.

31:03.024 --> 31:06.221
Fanning completes that and delivers it
to Mr. Jones at his rental apartment.

31:06.795 --> 31:07.853
Check.

31:08.063 --> 31:09.394
There's a dispute over money,

31:09.564 --> 31:11.725
or maybe Jones wants
to tie up loose ends.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.061
Either way, Fanning is shot.

31:14.536 --> 31:16.561
Fanning checks out checkless.
Check.

31:16.771 --> 31:19.604
- We're missing something.
- Check.

31:19.808 --> 31:21.241
No, no, no. Deeks.

31:23.078 --> 31:24.409
We are missing something.

31:25.213 --> 31:27.807
- Okay.
- All right.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.582
- Jones works for Abdul.
- Go on.

31:30.785 --> 31:32.810
What if Abdul met with Jones

31:32.988 --> 31:35.923
before he left for Yemen
to give him Sam's details?

31:36.124 --> 31:38.319
Jones' apartment
had only been rented out for a week.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.618
Right.

31:39.794 --> 31:43.992
- So if Abdul did meet with Jones...
- It wasn't at the apartment.

31:44.499 --> 31:47.730
- It could have been at Jones' house.
- Check.

31:47.936 --> 31:51.201
Abdul flew out to Yemen
the day after he broke out of prison.

31:51.406 --> 31:53.931
- He flew on fake passport.
- Jones must have given it to him.

31:54.109 --> 31:55.576
Where did Abdul stay that night?

31:55.777 --> 31:58.109
We were tracking him
on Overwatch.

31:58.313 --> 32:00.611
Stayed at the West Hollywood
Motor Inn on Wilton.

32:01.583 --> 32:04.313
- A clue?
- Maybe even witnesses.

32:04.519 --> 32:07.818
- It's always quiet midweek.
- How quiet?

32:08.590 --> 32:10.820
- No new bookings that night.
- None?

32:11.726 --> 32:14.286
- Not a one.
- Nell said he definitely stayed all night.

32:14.496 --> 32:16.828
Maybe shared with somebody
that was already staying here.

32:16.998 --> 32:18.295
Do you mind if I take a look?

32:23.772 --> 32:26.639
All right, three guests.
Married couple from Idaho.

32:26.841 --> 32:28.138
Married. Hmm.

32:28.310 --> 32:30.005
She was young enough
to be his daughter.

32:30.445 --> 32:31.469
Well, scratch Idaho.

32:32.113 --> 32:33.671
Single woman from Texas.

32:33.882 --> 32:37.340
- Regular, same time every month.
- For how long?

32:38.253 --> 32:41.017
Long as I've owned the place.
Going on 27 years.

32:41.523 --> 32:43.889
And scratching Texas.

32:44.359 --> 32:47.795
What about this? It was occupied all
week, but there's no name against it.

32:47.996 --> 32:50.829
That's not a guest.
That's the night manager, Felix.

32:58.473 --> 33:00.134
Felix.

33:00.976 --> 33:02.910
Cops wanna have a word with you.

33:03.078 --> 33:05.410
- Witness or suspect?
- Suspect.

33:12.387 --> 33:13.479
Make that prime suspect.

33:15.290 --> 33:16.382
Go!

33:22.063 --> 33:25.032
Ready? Three, two, one, go.

33:40.181 --> 33:41.808
Scratch Felix.

33:47.756 --> 33:49.417
For a guy that lived here
for 18 months,

33:49.591 --> 33:51.957
he sure doesn't have much
to show for it.

33:52.127 --> 33:54.618
He's got
no big-screen flat plasma TV.

33:57.399 --> 33:59.230
Computer's configured for Arabic.

34:01.603 --> 34:03.537
No beer.

34:07.342 --> 34:10.038
No funky week-old clothes
in the corner.

34:12.347 --> 34:15.407
No pizza boxes.
This is very un-American.

34:16.150 --> 34:17.743
"Felix Attino."

34:18.652 --> 34:19.949
Colombian.

34:20.155 --> 34:24.216
That explains why he's un-American,
but not why he speaks Arabic.

34:27.128 --> 34:29.960
This would. Yemeni passport.

34:33.168 --> 34:34.260
Look at the name.

34:36.804 --> 34:39.774
We just found Abdul's brother.

34:50.885 --> 34:53.478
No wonder Saadat hasn't been seen
in Yemen. Been here all along.

34:53.687 --> 34:56.032
How hard is it to run a terrorist group
from the other side of the world?

34:56.056 --> 34:57.580
It's virtually impossible.

34:57.758 --> 34:59.555
I think Saadat was a misdirect.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.160
With this new intel, I went back
and analyzed what we knew,

35:02.329 --> 35:03.591
or what we thought we knew.

35:03.764 --> 35:05.925
I think the true leader of the group
is Abdul.

35:08.102 --> 35:10.161
And the news doesn't get any better.

35:10.337 --> 35:12.134
Warriors for Islam
have released a deadline

35:12.306 --> 35:13.796
for the Saudis
to meet their demands.

35:14.008 --> 35:16.238
- How long?
- One hour.

35:17.244 --> 35:20.611
But the Saudis have already rejected
a hostage exchange for the boy.

35:20.814 --> 35:22.975
Why would Abdul think
they would change their mind?

35:23.217 --> 35:24.343
I don't think he does.

35:25.119 --> 35:28.145
Guys, you better take a look at this.

35:32.526 --> 35:36.519
I broke the password to Saadat's
laptop, accessed his e-mails.

35:36.730 --> 35:37.754
Found this.

35:39.533 --> 35:41.501
Miss Jones, how's your Arabic?

35:41.669 --> 35:45.127
Well, it looks like the e-mails
are between Saadat and Abdul.

35:45.339 --> 35:48.866
Saadat was tipped off
by a State Department e-mail

35:49.109 --> 35:53.773
to the U.S. Embassy in Yemen
of Nate's presence in Sana'a.

35:53.948 --> 35:56.508
Saadat confirms
that the attached photos

35:56.684 --> 35:59.482
were taken
a week after Abdul's escape.

35:59.687 --> 36:03.179
And after Abdul saw
Nate stabbed by Sam.

36:03.357 --> 36:04.619
Nate's been compromised.

36:04.792 --> 36:06.783
Which means
Sam's been compromised.

36:08.529 --> 36:11.123
Why give Sam a fake passport
and an airline ticket to Yemen

36:11.298 --> 36:13.163
if you know
he's an undercover federal agent?

36:13.367 --> 36:15.028
It's a trap.

36:15.869 --> 36:21.865
A captured U.S. Federal agent
is a powerful propaganda tool.

36:24.411 --> 36:28.211
And much more leverage
than a 7-year-old boy.

36:28.983 --> 36:31.281
Eric, I need to talk to Callen.

36:31.485 --> 36:34.318
Miss Blye, alert Nate.

36:34.488 --> 36:36.718
Tell him
to get the hell out of that hotel.

36:36.890 --> 36:39.154
And, Nell,
get Director Vance on the phone.

36:39.326 --> 36:42.727
Tell him we need that authority
and we need it now.

36:52.106 --> 36:55.075
- Yeah?
- Callen's on speaker.

36:56.210 --> 36:57.575
Mr. Callen?

36:57.811 --> 36:59.870
Abort the mission.

37:00.447 --> 37:03.177
Sam's been compromised.

37:03.350 --> 37:05.841
Confirm, Mr. Callen.

37:06.020 --> 37:09.547
Confirmed. Aborting mission.

37:26.140 --> 37:27.198
Wait.

37:31.612 --> 37:33.477
I'll go with you.

38:08.582 --> 38:11.176
Which federal agency
do you work for?

38:16.523 --> 38:17.922
NCIS.

38:18.959 --> 38:20.290
I know of them.

38:20.494 --> 38:24.089
Then you know it's best you surrender
now while you still have a chance.

38:25.933 --> 38:27.423
You know, I like you, Hakeem.

38:30.904 --> 38:34.431
- Sam.
- Sam.

38:34.775 --> 38:38.211
I'm not going to kill you. Yet.

38:38.545 --> 38:43.209
But a display to your country
and their foreign allies of our resolve

38:43.450 --> 38:46.146
should be enough to bring them
to the negotiating table.

39:28.695 --> 39:30.356
Abdul!

39:37.704 --> 39:40.195
Need that authority, Hetty.
Need it now.

39:41.775 --> 39:43.003
Director?

39:43.911 --> 39:46.539
- Authority granted, Mr. Callen.
- Green light, Sam.

39:49.483 --> 39:51.280
Sam, green light.

39:54.221 --> 39:56.189
Target painted.

41:13.867 --> 41:14.993
Let's go home.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.330
I'm staying.

41:19.006 --> 41:20.803
There's work to do in Dubai.

41:21.341 --> 41:22.968
Or Oman.

41:23.143 --> 41:24.974
Hetty wasn't sure which.

41:27.381 --> 41:29.281
We'll see you around, Nate.

41:48.535 --> 41:50.093
What?

41:51.405 --> 41:52.736
Why did you hesitate?

41:56.009 --> 41:57.636
Targeting Abdul?

42:00.213 --> 42:02.408
Wanted to be sure
why I was squeezing the trigger.

42:05.185 --> 42:06.209
Moe?

42:12.926 --> 42:15.224
Revenge or justice?

42:17.397 --> 42:18.728
Justice.

42:22.569 --> 42:24.161
I hope.

42:38.952 --> 42:42.251
- This isn't the way home.
- Nope.

42:42.422 --> 42:44.947
Promised Hetty I'd get her a futah.

42:45.392 --> 42:47.952
Bright colors.

42:48.295 --> 42:50.388
Better get her two.
