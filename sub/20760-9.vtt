00:00.478 --> 00:02.205
Previously, on "12 Monkeys"...

00:02.230 --> 00:05.086
I used to blame myself
for what happened that day.

00:05.111 --> 00:06.711
This is the part where you run.

00:08.690 --> 00:11.570
No, this isn't for me! This is for her!

00:11.595 --> 00:13.071
You're locked up with
nothing but the voices

00:13.096 --> 00:14.610
in your head to keep you company.

00:14.635 --> 00:17.782
The serpent eats it
tail. Return to Titan.

00:17.807 --> 00:19.782
- He's primary.
- Word of the Witness.

00:19.807 --> 00:21.805
Grow back through time
with expiration dates.

00:21.830 --> 00:23.397
His whole history.

00:23.422 --> 00:25.454
A world without death, without time.

00:25.479 --> 00:27.290
- It's unstoppable.
- He can choose his own fate.

00:27.315 --> 00:29.090
1919 Islington.

00:29.115 --> 00:30.215
You'll find the answers you seek.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.813
Our son lived here.

00:40.771 --> 00:42.165
Is that it?

00:42.396 --> 00:45.095
No. This one's different.

00:46.739 --> 00:49.339
Sebastian said we'd find answers here.

00:49.922 --> 00:51.322
Then let's find them.

00:55.884 --> 00:59.338
"Arrived amongst the fleeing masses.

00:59.363 --> 01:03.221
"Met a man named Owens
who wanted to die here.

01:03.246 --> 01:06.043
"We drank whiskey until the
air turned thick with soot

01:06.137 --> 01:08.604
and the trees burned red with fire."

01:09.821 --> 01:12.039
These are all things he's witnessed.

01:12.157 --> 01:13.757
They're journal entries.

01:15.024 --> 01:16.757
There's hundreds of these.

01:18.617 --> 01:20.421
Rome, 1610.

01:21.687 --> 01:23.436
Paris, 1840.

01:24.206 --> 01:25.206
New York, 2020.

01:25.237 --> 01:27.570
He's moving randomly through time.

01:42.009 --> 01:42.818
Sorry?

01:42.878 --> 01:44.544
Switch off the light!

01:44.708 --> 01:46.074
It isn't safe.

01:46.185 --> 01:48.419
I assure you, we are quite safe enough.

01:48.521 --> 01:49.691
The bombs will never reach this inn.

01:59.465 --> 02:01.766
Cancer, age 47.

02:01.868 --> 02:04.212
Automotive accident, 53.

02:04.977 --> 02:07.766
Homicide, 31.

02:08.842 --> 02:11.576
My days are spent living amongst ghosts.

02:11.678 --> 02:14.345
Tedious. Predictable.

02:14.447 --> 02:16.180
I'm just an observer.

02:16.282 --> 02:18.583
Connoisseur.

02:18.685 --> 02:19.803
Traveler.

02:22.555 --> 02:24.689
I've seen society rise...

02:24.791 --> 02:27.792
and fall.

02:30.096 --> 02:33.497
And as I'm Primary...
or some variation of...

02:33.600 --> 02:34.699
I have visions.

02:37.704 --> 02:40.438
Often of how those I'm
closest to will meet their end.

02:44.310 --> 02:46.244
I find that freedom is the best way

02:46.346 --> 02:48.479
to cope with my particular affliction.

02:48.581 --> 02:51.282
Without this freedom, those visions

02:51.384 --> 02:53.084
that have plagued me... My demons...

02:53.186 --> 02:55.486
my curse of foresight...

02:55.588 --> 02:57.555
I fear I might go mad.

03:00.026 --> 03:01.859
Fortunate for me,

03:01.961 --> 03:04.028
I possess the means to stay sane.

03:04.130 --> 03:05.730
The ability to travel anywhere...

03:05.832 --> 03:08.099
Any when... At will.

03:15.675 --> 03:17.975
Well, that's unfortunate.

03:40.766 --> 03:44.935
I have never seen
pieces like this before.

03:45.037 --> 03:47.238
I make clocks, watches.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.507
Well, it belongs to something
very similar to a watch.

03:50.610 --> 03:53.611
A timepiece. Intricate, precise,

03:53.713 --> 03:56.480
and I need you to
recreate it for me exactly.

03:56.582 --> 03:58.983
This is gonna take weeks to tool.

03:59.085 --> 04:00.707
And a considerable amount of money.

04:00.848 --> 04:02.481
The price is not a concern.

04:02.583 --> 04:03.916
Only its perfection.

04:04.018 --> 04:06.152
I have every faith in your ability...

04:06.254 --> 04:07.953
I want your bits of gold.

04:08.055 --> 04:10.523
The pieces that Enslow
Carver brings you.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.324
The ones that he steals.

04:12.426 --> 04:15.194
I saw him drop some off this
morning, so let's have it.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.563
Are you sure you want to
steal from Enslow Carver?

04:17.665 --> 04:20.099
I'll be having the pieces or your head.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.166
Only I'd kindly ask you not to take...

04:30.260 --> 04:31.610
that one.

04:31.712 --> 04:33.812
Excuse me.

04:36.217 --> 04:38.350
Stop that woman!

04:40.087 --> 04:41.453
Stop, thief!

05:14.188 --> 05:16.956
More water, sir?

05:18.392 --> 05:20.229
Sir?

05:20.327 --> 05:22.260
Water, please.

05:36.510 --> 05:37.843
The pain.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.578
It will go soon.

05:41.816 --> 05:44.550
You're misplaced, sir.

05:44.652 --> 05:46.652
You have no idea.

05:46.754 --> 05:49.455
You've no fear of a pistol at your back.

05:49.557 --> 05:53.492
In my experience, they're
inconvenient from any direction.

05:58.032 --> 05:59.732
You stole something from me, thief.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.101
- Best live without it.
- I'm far better with it.

06:02.203 --> 06:04.903
Hmm, is it worth your life, then?

06:05.006 --> 06:07.406
Your manhood?

06:07.508 --> 06:10.376
Like my manhood, it has far
greater value to me than to you.

06:10.478 --> 06:12.711
I pity the woman for whom
that statement holds true.

06:14.282 --> 06:16.815
I have no interest in what
you stole from the watchmaker.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.784
Aside from curiosity.

06:18.886 --> 06:22.321
Save for one piece.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.490
Round.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.558
Golden in color.

06:26.661 --> 06:29.094
If you please.

06:44.512 --> 06:45.844
Why the mask?

06:45.946 --> 06:49.232
If you're promising death,
best to look the part.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.518
Must be dreadful to wake
up on the table and wonder

06:52.620 --> 06:54.653
whether it's a demon or
a doctor tending to you.

06:54.755 --> 06:56.555
Worse for them not to wake at all.

06:56.657 --> 06:57.877
So you're a doctor yourself, then.

06:57.955 --> 07:00.659
Oh, right, we are.

07:00.761 --> 07:03.228
Only men-folk for the
sawbones, women only fit

07:03.331 --> 07:04.997
for cleaning up the shite and piss.

07:05.099 --> 07:07.266
Please don't make assumptions.
The history I've seen

07:07.368 --> 07:11.637
is one of great women
sung badly by clumsy men.

07:11.739 --> 07:13.205
Still,

07:13.307 --> 07:15.708
why would a healer play the thief?

07:15.810 --> 07:18.277
The poor are expected to just die here,

07:18.379 --> 07:20.145
on the streets, penniless.

07:20.247 --> 07:23.549
Medicines, well, they cost money.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.625
It's a real shame about the mask.

07:28.389 --> 07:31.514
You have a face Lazarus
himself would rise to see.

07:33.361 --> 07:36.095
See, of the two of us,
I suspect that your mask

07:36.197 --> 07:39.465
is older, more finely crafted.

07:41.736 --> 07:43.836
But no man's charm is so practiced

07:43.938 --> 07:47.206
who knows himself well.

07:50.411 --> 07:52.316
Right you are, then.

07:54.348 --> 07:56.615
Good day, ma'am.

08:06.404 --> 08:08.068
_

08:10.131 --> 08:12.064
It needs to be stronger.

08:12.166 --> 08:13.332
If the pieces seize together

08:13.434 --> 08:15.734
while the mechanism is initiating...

08:18.205 --> 08:20.172
Keep trying.

08:20.274 --> 08:22.674
Are you staying in the city for a while?

08:22.777 --> 08:25.110
London's not a terrible place.

08:25.212 --> 08:27.546
I'm sure a wealthy gentleman like you

08:27.648 --> 08:30.082
could find ways to pass his time.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.297
Ah. Excuse me.

08:45.399 --> 08:47.666
I'm looking for the, uh...

08:47.768 --> 08:50.869
The woman? The doctor?

08:53.174 --> 08:54.473
Why are you here?

08:54.575 --> 08:55.774
I realized I neglected

08:55.876 --> 08:57.309
to introduce myself the other day...

09:27.308 --> 09:29.079
Miss Goines?

09:31.178 --> 09:33.078
What is this?

09:33.180 --> 09:35.180
It's what I see.

09:37.084 --> 09:39.718
It's all I see.

09:41.755 --> 09:46.725
You have no idea what
it's like for me in here.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.260
Maybe we should get her outside

09:48.362 --> 09:49.878
and get her some fresh air.

09:49.972 --> 09:53.866
No. In here.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.869
Oh...

09:56.971 --> 09:59.505
Miss Goines...

09:59.607 --> 10:01.373
Then help me.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.309
Help me understand
the mind of a Primary.

10:04.411 --> 10:06.245
This image you see.

10:06.347 --> 10:09.715
Is it the past?

10:09.817 --> 10:11.183
The present?

10:11.285 --> 10:13.785
The future?

10:13.888 --> 10:16.878
It's the end of the story, Jonesy.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.392
Look around.

10:20.494 --> 10:23.095
We all play a part.

10:33.292 --> 10:35.682
They haven't jumped since
we lost them in London.

10:35.814 --> 10:37.580
So they're either still there, or...

10:37.682 --> 10:40.383
They've found a way to
conceal their movements.

10:40.485 --> 10:42.552
Jennifer have anything useful?

10:42.654 --> 10:44.487
Yeah, she calls it "the end."

10:44.589 --> 10:47.023
The Witness's return to Titan.

10:47.125 --> 10:48.791
What do you make of it?

10:48.893 --> 10:52.562
Prophecy or bullshit?

10:52.664 --> 10:54.497
You're a scientist.

10:54.599 --> 10:56.999
Your mind marches in
a logical direction.

10:57.102 --> 10:59.469
Jennifer's thought
process is more random.

10:59.571 --> 11:02.772
Past, present, future, all at once.

11:02.874 --> 11:05.375
Primaries are driven to insanity by it.

11:05.477 --> 11:07.229
They don't see the gift.

11:09.314 --> 11:10.880
Do I detect envy?

11:10.982 --> 11:14.917
Wouldn't you like to see
the puzzle from above?

11:31.002 --> 11:32.279
Stay calm.

11:34.105 --> 11:35.185
You are quite safe.

11:36.497 --> 11:38.431
Eliza.

11:39.244 --> 11:40.933
Where am I?

11:40.958 --> 11:42.937
My home.

11:43.681 --> 11:45.848
I told the nurses I'd take
you to a proper hospital.

11:45.950 --> 11:48.593
Oh, no, this is no hospital.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.903
A hospital, by my definition, is a place

11:50.957 --> 11:53.524
where you have the
least chance of dying.

11:53.689 --> 11:55.020
Here.

11:56.327 --> 11:58.361
How am I here?

11:58.463 --> 12:01.998
There will come a
time... one imagines...

12:02.100 --> 12:03.933
when even the simplest
grocer will stock medicines

12:04.035 --> 12:07.236
that could have saved
a millennia of corpses.

12:07.338 --> 12:09.114
You, um...

12:11.209 --> 12:12.642
You had a staph infection.

12:12.744 --> 12:15.244
A simple infection. Nothing more.

12:15.346 --> 12:16.822
How long have I been here?

12:16.862 --> 12:18.395
Couple of days.

12:18.716 --> 12:21.117
I had to give you a sedative.

12:21.219 --> 12:23.219
You were lucid briefly.

12:23.321 --> 12:25.254
You put up a hell of a fight.

12:25.356 --> 12:27.323
And did you have your way with me?

12:27.425 --> 12:29.625
No, that's not part of the cure.

12:29.727 --> 12:33.162
And I find you far more
interesting conscious.

12:33.264 --> 12:35.324
May I?

12:36.668 --> 12:40.102
A funny sod, you are.

12:40.205 --> 12:44.507
You know, if you're
so learned in medicine,

12:44.609 --> 12:46.442
why don't you help me in the hospital?

12:46.544 --> 12:47.871
Be of some use to others?

12:48.019 --> 12:52.415
Alas, my travels keep
me suitably useless.

12:52.517 --> 12:54.784
To none but yourself.

12:59.157 --> 13:01.290
Hmm.

13:04.596 --> 13:06.963
My apologies, sir.

13:07.065 --> 13:08.211
May I try again?

13:08.279 --> 13:09.712
Please.

13:11.836 --> 13:15.338
If you don't let me take
it out, it will fester.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.743
Now, stop this bloody foolishness!

13:17.798 --> 13:19.308
Hold him down!

13:21.246 --> 13:22.812
Huh? Ah!

13:22.914 --> 13:25.414
My journey's been delayed.

13:25.517 --> 13:28.102
I thought I might like
to dine with you tonight.

13:28.990 --> 13:30.423
No.

13:30.955 --> 13:33.813
I thought you'd say that.

13:38.663 --> 13:39.929
And who are they?

13:40.031 --> 13:41.664
These are five highly-qualified nurses

13:41.766 --> 13:43.499
I've hired to give you the night off.

13:43.601 --> 13:45.501
Since I knew you wouldn't
rescind your duties

13:45.603 --> 13:49.472
unless you were adequately
compensated for here.

13:49.574 --> 13:52.341
God, I hate the way you talk.

13:59.117 --> 14:01.914
Did you bring me here to embarrass me?

14:02.121 --> 14:04.355
Not you, them.

14:07.992 --> 14:10.092
You should have more pride
in your simple nurse's apron

14:10.194 --> 14:12.628
than they have in their
hats and petticoats.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.530
Anyway, who cares what they think?

14:14.632 --> 14:16.663
I think you look charming.

14:19.304 --> 14:21.137
Have you dined here before?

14:21.239 --> 14:22.872
Of course not.

14:22.974 --> 14:24.407
Why?

14:24.509 --> 14:26.409
You feign ignorance.

14:26.511 --> 14:27.743
But I decipher from your carriage

14:27.845 --> 14:30.613
that you are not from
the slums that you serve.

14:30.715 --> 14:33.249
The past is merely a shadow

14:33.351 --> 14:36.085
that the present cannot hide.

14:36.187 --> 14:39.055
It stalks us.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.774
Shall we, uh...

14:44.262 --> 14:45.294
shall we order?

14:45.396 --> 14:46.762
The food here is middling.

14:46.864 --> 14:48.297
Is that meant to entice me?

14:48.399 --> 14:49.599
- What, the menu?
- No, no.

14:49.701 --> 14:52.969
Your insight. How about the truth?

14:53.071 --> 14:54.870
All right, the food here is terrible.

14:54.973 --> 14:56.739
About why I'm here.

14:56.841 --> 14:58.874
You know, since I was a little girl,

14:58.977 --> 15:01.210
I've known two types of gentlemen.

15:01.312 --> 15:02.411
Have you, now?

15:02.513 --> 15:03.579
Sir?

15:03.681 --> 15:06.225
The madam's attire, it's...

15:06.486 --> 15:07.819
um...

15:07.968 --> 15:09.467
Affordable.

15:09.569 --> 15:11.056
Piss off.

15:12.457 --> 15:14.590
I'm so sorry. You were saying?

15:14.692 --> 15:17.994
Uh, two types of gentlemen?

15:18.096 --> 15:20.229
I'm an educated, learned woman,

15:20.331 --> 15:22.031
blessed with a pretty face,

15:22.133 --> 15:24.734
and most men wish to
either strike me or bed me.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.169
Now, despite all
opportunity and provocation,

15:27.271 --> 15:29.372
you didn't attempt the
first, which makes me believe

15:29.474 --> 15:30.673
you desire the latter.

15:30.775 --> 15:32.208
- Well...
- But you're right.

15:32.310 --> 15:34.610
I did escape my privilege
with just enough education

15:34.712 --> 15:36.545
to help those who had none.

15:36.648 --> 15:38.014
And with a little bit o' the old cockney

15:38.116 --> 15:40.850
so they'd trust me with a needle.

15:40.952 --> 15:43.152
So given the choices
that I've made in my life,

15:43.254 --> 15:44.920
you should understand that your...

15:45.023 --> 15:46.722
your lifestyle doesn't interest me.

15:46.824 --> 15:49.859
Your ways of purchase do not impress me.

15:49.961 --> 15:51.360
But I do rightly thank
you for the nurses,

15:51.462 --> 15:54.230
and I shall return them
to you filthy and haggard.

15:54.332 --> 15:55.865
- Oh...
- Please.

15:55.967 --> 15:59.201
Enjoy the beauty of your decadence.

16:01.673 --> 16:04.140
Ladies and gentlemen,
I crave your indulgence.

16:04.242 --> 16:06.736
A moment of your time, if you please.

16:06.982 --> 16:08.948
Or, rather, a game.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.113
In three rounds.

16:11.215 --> 16:14.083
For the price of removing your jackets,

16:14.185 --> 16:16.989
I will absorb the cost of your starters.

16:20.591 --> 16:22.525
Anyone?

16:26.148 --> 16:28.581
Anyone at all. Come on.

16:32.315 --> 16:34.382
Ah, thank you.

16:41.145 --> 16:44.647
Wonderful. A room full of economists.

16:44.749 --> 16:49.618
And secondly, but for the
austerity of your vests,

16:49.721 --> 16:52.021
the main courses.

16:54.892 --> 16:57.793
And lastly, to prove to m'lady here

16:57.895 --> 16:59.495
that I damn well didn't invite her here

16:59.597 --> 17:01.197
to impress her by appearances,

17:01.299 --> 17:05.101
but for the honor of
your shoes and socks,

17:05.203 --> 17:06.502
the bar tab.

17:15.179 --> 17:17.213
Splendid.

17:17.315 --> 17:20.616
"Since I was a child, I would
see the end of everything.

17:20.718 --> 17:23.219
"Every person's death.

17:23.320 --> 17:24.787
"Their last moment.

17:24.888 --> 17:29.091
"Such a thing could drive
one to isolation or madness.

17:29.193 --> 17:31.794
"But I cannot see this woman's death.

17:31.896 --> 17:34.597
"She is a mystery.

17:34.699 --> 17:36.988
"Strong. Ahead of her time.

17:37.019 --> 17:38.619
"Defying it.

17:41.858 --> 17:44.892
"I steal her as often as I can.

17:44.994 --> 17:48.028
When she refuses, I resort
to more desperate measures."

18:02.879 --> 18:07.014
"I've learned that love
knows nothing of time.

18:07.116 --> 18:09.416
"I've consumed my days with a woman

18:09.519 --> 18:12.253
"who lives to defy destiny.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.991
What better way to defy my own."

18:48.637 --> 18:50.506
Hey, you.

18:51.874 --> 18:53.607
Hola, senorita.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.809
Keep your cool, Three Face.

18:55.911 --> 18:57.377
They're watching.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.901
Whatever.

18:58.926 --> 19:00.392
You're not really here.

19:00.417 --> 19:02.918
- No shit.
- Go away!

19:03.252 --> 19:05.519
Okay? I have enough voices in my head.

19:05.621 --> 19:07.621
That's the problem.

19:07.723 --> 19:09.323
You're not listening to any of them.

19:09.425 --> 19:11.658
Because they're all you!

19:11.761 --> 19:14.628
Thousands of whispering, ranting yous.

19:14.730 --> 19:15.996
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer!

19:16.098 --> 19:19.199
Uh, but they're not.

19:19.301 --> 19:20.200
Listen.

19:21.771 --> 19:23.771
Those voices aren't just us, kiddo.

19:23.873 --> 19:26.173
Who are they, then?

19:26.275 --> 19:28.088
The others like us.

19:28.358 --> 19:29.624
Primaries.

19:29.694 --> 19:31.622
They're trying to tell you something.

19:31.647 --> 19:33.580
Could they do it in English, please?

19:33.682 --> 19:36.116
Yeah, that was always annoying.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.986
You've got everything you need already.

19:39.088 --> 19:41.421
Think.

19:41.524 --> 19:43.023
What do you see?

19:43.125 --> 19:44.491
The end.

19:44.593 --> 19:46.915
The dying man.

19:48.097 --> 19:50.664
And this place. The mausoleum.

19:50.766 --> 19:53.320
Oh. Huh.

19:54.937 --> 19:56.637
But I don't know when this is.

19:56.739 --> 19:58.005
Yes, you do.

19:58.107 --> 19:59.473
It's not in the future.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.975
And I'm gonna go ahead and say

20:02.077 --> 20:03.377
it's not in the past.

20:03.479 --> 20:04.385
My present.

20:04.702 --> 20:05.400
Ding!

20:06.081 --> 20:08.415
So what do the voices say?

20:08.517 --> 20:11.919
What is time trying to tell you?

20:12.021 --> 20:14.321
Save the dying man.

20:14.423 --> 20:17.658
But I'm stuck here!

20:17.760 --> 20:19.493
Got to think outside the box.

20:19.595 --> 20:20.761
Psst.

20:20.863 --> 20:23.297
Hey. Use your head.

20:25.682 --> 20:26.930
No!

20:31.772 --> 20:33.538
No...

20:49.081 --> 20:50.832
Is this all you can do?

20:52.115 --> 20:55.283
Kill yourself?

20:55.386 --> 20:57.553
Instead of helping us?

20:57.655 --> 20:59.154
This is your choice?

20:59.255 --> 21:01.255
Jonesy,

21:01.358 --> 21:04.459
it's all you ever wanted.

21:04.562 --> 21:07.228
What's in my head.

21:08.399 --> 21:10.532
I don't want it anymore.

21:10.634 --> 21:12.734
And I'm giving it to you.

21:12.836 --> 21:15.404
Drop by drop.

21:18.542 --> 21:19.708
What are you doing?

21:19.810 --> 21:22.177
We are done.

21:26.917 --> 21:29.017
I killed her once.

21:29.119 --> 21:31.920
I am not gonna let you... or her...

21:32.022 --> 21:34.256
do it again.

21:34.358 --> 21:37.426
Jennifer, listen.

21:37.528 --> 21:39.561
Where do you want to go?

21:39.663 --> 21:42.297
Anywhere but here. Any when.

21:42.399 --> 21:45.500
Just tell me.

21:47.371 --> 21:49.438
I want to go home.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.440
Home... home...

21:56.313 --> 21:58.880
Athan.

22:00.517 --> 22:02.818
Nightmares?

22:02.920 --> 22:06.588
What dream is so terrible
to knock your resolve?

22:06.690 --> 22:07.422
Hmm?

22:07.524 --> 22:09.458
I see a thing.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.326
A creature.

22:11.428 --> 22:13.735
Something I'm meant to become.

22:14.665 --> 22:17.394
And it is lost and lonely.

22:18.335 --> 22:20.863
Melancholy beyond words, angry.

22:21.505 --> 22:24.640
It doesn't feel like me.

22:26.510 --> 22:29.282
I don't want to become it.

22:29.747 --> 22:31.980
Then you won't.

22:37.054 --> 22:39.111
Who's this?

22:40.424 --> 22:42.291
My father.

22:42.393 --> 22:44.960
"I've only met my father twice.

22:45.062 --> 22:46.728
- "Once when..."
- ...I was very young."

22:46.830 --> 22:49.164
The second time when I was much older...

23:15.693 --> 23:19.013
Hardly seems worth it, huh?

23:20.331 --> 23:22.964
All that effort for a bag of junk.

23:23.067 --> 23:24.968
What do you want?

23:26.170 --> 23:29.132
A trade, perhaps?

23:30.007 --> 23:32.380
Conversation.

23:33.544 --> 23:35.349
One traveler to another.

23:46.623 --> 23:48.090
Why do you think they were carrying

23:48.192 --> 23:49.725
all this around with them?

23:49.827 --> 23:52.394
Surely would have slowed them down.

23:52.496 --> 23:54.996
People try to stay what they were.

23:55.099 --> 23:56.565
Before.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.433
But not you.

23:58.535 --> 24:00.602
I didn't have a before.

24:00.704 --> 24:03.171
Child of the apocalypse.

24:03.273 --> 24:06.274
But your parents?

24:06.377 --> 24:09.044
No memories there?

24:09.146 --> 24:12.080
Happiness?

24:12.182 --> 24:13.886
Sadness?

24:16.286 --> 24:18.543
Never knew my mother.

24:19.390 --> 24:22.924
Only have a few memories of my dad.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.924
Well, we've got that in common.

24:25.389 --> 24:27.757
Do we?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.566
How many people have you killed?

24:31.668 --> 24:34.102
What do you care?

24:34.204 --> 24:36.471
What, are you telling me
you haven't done things?

24:36.573 --> 24:39.197
Things you wish you could take back?

24:40.778 --> 24:43.378
That's not what haunts me.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.414
I fear...

24:45.516 --> 24:48.183
what I will become.

24:50.921 --> 24:53.488
Well, we have that in common.

25:02.366 --> 25:03.865
What do you reckon?

25:03.967 --> 25:06.134
More junk?

25:06.236 --> 25:08.218
They were happy once.

25:09.206 --> 25:11.807
And then it was all gone.

25:11.909 --> 25:14.117
That's all that's left.

25:15.479 --> 25:18.547
Well, I suppose then we're
the fortunate ones, aren't we?

25:18.649 --> 25:21.436
Can't mourn what you never had, can you?

25:23.020 --> 25:25.515
If I ever had anything like that,

25:26.723 --> 25:28.565
even for a minute,

25:29.860 --> 25:32.394
I'd give up a lifetime of anything else.

25:40.504 --> 25:41.970
Ah!

25:42.072 --> 25:43.238
What is it?

25:43.340 --> 25:44.673
Ah!

25:44.775 --> 25:46.274
Oh, it's just a pain.

25:46.376 --> 25:47.430
In my leg.

25:47.634 --> 25:50.250
No, it's nothing. It's just a cramp.

25:51.048 --> 25:54.683
Oh, you're still not sleeping.

25:56.553 --> 25:57.992
No.

26:03.527 --> 26:05.510
I've been thinking.

26:06.597 --> 26:10.999
There are other places besides London.

26:11.101 --> 26:11.967
Besides now.

26:12.069 --> 26:14.236
What are we running from, Athan?

26:14.338 --> 26:16.371
Your past? Your future?

26:16.473 --> 26:17.906
I'm not running from anything.

26:18.008 --> 26:20.475
I'm just saying that there are

26:20.577 --> 26:22.377
other places where...

26:23.347 --> 26:25.080
where a woman like
yourself would never be made

26:25.182 --> 26:28.316
- to feel less than anything...
- Oh, fantasies.

26:28.418 --> 26:29.917
If I could show you...

26:31.822 --> 26:34.691
If I could take you there,

26:35.926 --> 26:38.059
would you come with me?

26:39.730 --> 26:41.796
We have no world, Athan, no hour,

26:41.899 --> 26:43.965
but the one that we're given.

26:44.067 --> 26:47.655
And only here are we meant
to serve and be tested.

26:48.705 --> 26:52.107
Oh, yes, but...

26:52.209 --> 26:55.710
what if you could see
the puzzle from above?

26:55.812 --> 26:57.979
And then...

26:58.081 --> 27:00.248
and then you could
rearrange all those pieces?

27:00.350 --> 27:02.551
Then you would be a
god, and no man or woman

27:02.653 --> 27:04.852
were ever meant to be such.

27:05.656 --> 27:07.923
Yet there's another fantasy here.

27:08.025 --> 27:11.126
- Oh.
- Where reality doesn't exist.

27:15.032 --> 27:17.632
You know I love being with you, Athan,

27:17.734 --> 27:20.848
but I have patients to tend to.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.471
Those without warm beds.

28:13.357 --> 28:14.823
Get off me!

28:17.628 --> 28:19.794
Good evening, Miss.

28:19.896 --> 28:22.497
My name is Enslow Carver.

28:22.599 --> 28:24.853
I'm sure you've heard of me.

28:26.870 --> 28:30.238
To my beautiful thief.

28:30.340 --> 28:33.408
Never in my years have I
chosen to confide in someone

28:33.510 --> 28:35.510
as I am about to with you.

28:35.612 --> 28:40.115
I was willing to ignore
your petty thievery.

28:42.319 --> 28:45.854
But then you started stealing from me.

28:45.956 --> 28:48.356
I am a man haunted by destiny.

28:48.458 --> 28:50.458
One based on destruction.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.846
One that I have fled
from my entire life.

28:53.830 --> 28:55.597
Yet, for the first time, with you,

28:55.699 --> 28:57.799
I see a life that is my own.

28:57.901 --> 29:00.101
- Miss...
- Wonderfully undefined.

29:00.203 --> 29:01.636
Without fear, or flight...

29:01.738 --> 29:03.538
No...

29:58.757 --> 29:59.723
You lying bastard!

29:59.825 --> 30:01.758
Ah!

30:01.860 --> 30:03.527
Such craftsmanship.

30:03.629 --> 30:05.829
Such skill.

30:10.169 --> 30:12.702
Surely you could have
done what I asked by now,

30:12.805 --> 30:15.238
unless you have merely
enjoyed taking my money.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.708
Under the counter.

31:24.743 --> 31:27.911
Get off me!

31:28.013 --> 31:30.147
Good evening, Miss.

31:30.249 --> 31:32.949
My name is Enslow Carver.

31:33.051 --> 31:37.454
I was willing to ignore
your petty thievery.

31:37.556 --> 31:40.450
But then you started stealing from me.

31:41.793 --> 31:43.110
Please...

31:43.135 --> 31:44.335
No...

31:46.151 --> 31:47.350
Ah!

32:07.719 --> 32:10.854
You were going to draw
your blade across her neck.

32:17.429 --> 32:19.329
Athan, stop.

32:27.894 --> 32:29.476
Athan...

32:31.543 --> 32:35.245
What have you done?

32:39.117 --> 32:41.318
It was the only way.

32:41.420 --> 32:44.487
These men were going to murder you.

32:44.590 --> 32:47.224
I couldn't let that happen. Not again.

32:47.326 --> 32:49.292
Again?

32:49.394 --> 32:53.196
I have been at your funeral, Eliza.

32:53.298 --> 32:58.068
I have laid jasmine and
lavender on your coffin.

32:58.170 --> 33:00.303
Don't be afraid.

33:00.405 --> 33:02.572
I killed them to save you.

33:15.380 --> 33:16.846
I am not a monster.

33:17.222 --> 33:19.656
And you speak of what?

33:19.758 --> 33:20.924
The future?

33:21.026 --> 33:23.360
Manipulating time? Changing it?

33:23.462 --> 33:26.763
It was wrong of me to
expect you to understand.

33:30.002 --> 33:32.669
Please, Eliza. Please.

33:32.771 --> 33:34.704
Do not look at me that way.

33:54.393 --> 33:56.793
I want to give you something.

34:00.632 --> 34:02.947
My father gave it to me.

34:03.568 --> 34:05.802
It's all that I have of him.

34:10.542 --> 34:12.574
It's broken.

34:12.678 --> 34:13.943
I don't understand...

34:14.045 --> 34:15.745
It's broken.

34:15.847 --> 34:17.380
It cannot be set.

34:17.482 --> 34:20.684
The hands cannot be
rewound or moved forward.

34:20.786 --> 34:22.252
There's only now.

34:22.353 --> 34:25.088
There's only today.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.257
And from this moment
on, you are reminded

34:27.359 --> 34:30.960
that time is never to be manipulated.

34:31.063 --> 34:33.027
It is ungodly.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.068
I couldn't let you die.

34:40.605 --> 34:43.062
I would do anything for you.

34:47.478 --> 34:50.080
Then you'll never do it again.

35:14.906 --> 35:17.640
Eliza?

35:17.743 --> 35:20.276
Eliza, look.

35:26.084 --> 35:28.351
Eliza?

35:35.527 --> 35:36.693
Eliza.

35:43.068 --> 35:44.834
Eliza.

35:54.946 --> 35:56.179
Ah...

35:56.281 --> 35:57.680
Ah!

35:57.783 --> 35:59.182
What is it?

36:05.424 --> 36:08.491
She died again.

36:15.734 --> 36:18.668
These are all the times
he tried to save her.

36:19.938 --> 36:21.738
607.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.542
That is how many times
I tried to save Eliza.

36:25.644 --> 36:29.179
No matter what I did,
on the 26th day of June,

36:29.281 --> 36:32.615
1891, she dies.

36:44.042 --> 36:45.541
Cole.

36:58.210 --> 37:01.144
Dr. Railly.

37:01.246 --> 37:03.313
May I have a word?

37:09.242 --> 37:11.199
I thought I'd met every doctor here.

37:13.323 --> 37:15.456
I was on leave.

37:15.559 --> 37:17.259
I spent some time back in London.

37:17.354 --> 37:19.588
Hmm.

37:21.331 --> 37:23.906
Is that the first patient you've lost?

37:24.955 --> 37:26.109
Yes.

37:28.772 --> 37:30.727
I'm sorry.

37:32.242 --> 37:34.275
I had a similar scenario.

37:34.377 --> 37:36.878
Recently, a patient,

37:36.980 --> 37:40.315
a young woman.

37:40.417 --> 37:42.517
She only had a staph infection.

37:42.619 --> 37:45.820
So I prescribed Dicloxacillin.

37:45.922 --> 37:47.522
And wouldn't you know, it produced

37:47.624 --> 37:50.024
a deep vein thrombosis,
which eventually led to...

37:50.126 --> 37:51.326
An aneurysm.

37:51.428 --> 37:53.494
Cerebral aneurysm.

37:53.597 --> 37:57.799
So I thought if I tried
Warfarin to thin the blood...

37:57.901 --> 37:59.701
After the aneurysm?

37:59.803 --> 38:01.769
Mm... no...

38:01.871 --> 38:05.607
No, obviously not after the aneurysm.

38:05.709 --> 38:07.742
What I mean to say is
I was certain if I had

38:07.844 --> 38:09.277
tried the Warfarin,

38:09.379 --> 38:13.081
it would have caused a
reaction equal to an aneurysm.

38:14.384 --> 38:17.251
Some people, they just can't be saved.

38:17.354 --> 38:20.321
No matter what you do. You can't win.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.558
Like, if you could, hypothetically,

38:23.660 --> 38:28.196
say, if you could try
hundreds and, um...

38:29.699 --> 38:31.815
Hundreds of times.

38:33.803 --> 38:36.693
You'd still end up with the same result.

38:38.475 --> 38:41.609
My patient, the night he came in,

38:41.711 --> 38:44.746
there was an H1N1 panic
in the garment district.

38:44.848 --> 38:47.115
200-plus people in the ER.

38:47.217 --> 38:49.017
Everyone with a cough thought

38:49.119 --> 38:51.486
they were gonna die of the flu.

38:51.588 --> 38:54.255
When you're busy like that, it feels

38:54.349 --> 38:58.262
like time is running from you.

38:59.329 --> 39:02.044
And you just need it to stop.

39:03.566 --> 39:05.633
You just need everything to stop.

39:05.735 --> 39:08.302
You need people to stop bleeding,

39:08.405 --> 39:10.538
stop choking, for their lungs

39:10.640 --> 39:13.107
to stop filling with
fluid, to stop crying,

39:13.209 --> 39:16.010
to stop screaming...

39:18.181 --> 39:19.614
Dr. Railly?

39:19.716 --> 39:22.216
Your patient's parents are here.

39:28.892 --> 39:31.080
It doesn't.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.162
It doesn't stop.

39:34.264 --> 39:36.364
No, it doesn't stop.

39:36.466 --> 39:38.804
It takes, and it runs.

39:41.871 --> 39:44.335
Like a thief.

39:50.346 --> 39:53.577
You speak about time
as if it were an enemy.

39:54.484 --> 39:57.351
We can call ourselves
healers all we want,

39:57.454 --> 40:00.154
but all we're really doing
is just fighting the clock.

40:03.259 --> 40:05.626
And it always wins.

40:14.537 --> 40:19.140
I'm sorry, did I answer the
question you came to ask?

40:22.912 --> 40:24.912
Yes.

40:27.117 --> 40:31.252
And now, I finally
understand what I must do.

40:32.822 --> 40:34.922
Return to the place of my birth,

40:35.024 --> 40:37.925
and become the demon
I have always feared.

40:40.196 --> 40:42.196
And I will create others.

40:43.867 --> 40:46.167
The Army of the 12 Monkeys.

40:48.104 --> 40:51.405
And then shall come a plague

40:51.508 --> 40:54.742
so that time itself can be broken.

40:54.844 --> 40:58.946
So that one day, we will have forever.

40:59.048 --> 41:01.048
When the Forest is Red.

41:02.819 --> 41:05.219
Don't. Don't. This isn't on you.

41:05.321 --> 41:07.355
He came to me for help. In pain.

41:07.457 --> 41:10.558
When you know someone
you love is gonna die,

41:10.660 --> 41:12.460
and there's nothing
you can do about it...

41:12.562 --> 41:15.596
- James.
- He was looking for an excuse.

41:15.698 --> 41:17.398
He didn't just lose her once.

41:17.500 --> 41:19.467
He watched her die again and again.

41:19.569 --> 41:22.973
All those times he
stood over her body...

41:24.073 --> 41:26.073
I know how to find him.

41:38.249 --> 41:40.817
Miss Goines, you will be instrumental

41:40.919 --> 41:43.052
in rescuing my daughter.

41:43.154 --> 41:45.088
I will have her because of you.

41:45.190 --> 41:48.057
I want you to know that...

41:48.159 --> 41:51.561
I will always be
grateful to you for that.

41:51.663 --> 41:53.596
Ah... ah...

41:56.634 --> 42:00.470
Climb the steps... ring the bell...

42:00.572 --> 42:04.107
Climb the steps, ring the bell.

42:04.209 --> 42:06.542
Oh, well. Oh, well.

42:06.644 --> 42:08.111
I... oh...

42:08.213 --> 42:10.947
Initiate splinter sequence.

42:15.186 --> 42:17.120
I'm sorry.

42:25.830 --> 42:28.464
Like a fox.

42:29.968 --> 42:32.001
Katarina?

42:38.276 --> 42:40.443
I want this to end.

42:44.816 --> 42:46.849
All of it.

42:48.820 --> 42:52.055
The pain, the...

42:52.157 --> 42:55.058
suffering...

42:57.695 --> 43:00.063
It's time.

43:00.165 --> 43:03.066
Only you can bring it.

43:03.168 --> 43:04.700
I couldn't.

43:04.803 --> 43:08.071
No matter how much I tried.

43:08.173 --> 43:10.339
But you...

43:10.442 --> 43:12.809
You're better than me.

43:12.911 --> 43:16.946
Every way.

43:17.048 --> 43:19.315
It all began with you.

43:23.621 --> 43:26.189
Finish it.

43:44.576 --> 43:46.042
Mother.

43:46.144 --> 43:47.910
Father.

43:50.281 --> 43:53.371
After all this time,

43:55.120 --> 43:57.019
here we are together.

44:01.926 --> 44:03.049
At the end.
