is answer your questions

19:17.823 --> 19:19.458
- Let me think.

19:19.525 --> 19:20.492
No.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.628
- Well, maybe need
a little make out

19:22.694 --> 19:24.696
with the champ
to cheer you up.

19:24.763 --> 19:28.300
- Oh, so, you want
to make out with me?

19:28.367 --> 19:30.602
- Just trying to do
a girl a favor.

19:30.669 --> 19:31.803
- Ok.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.205
Close your eyes.

19:35.574 --> 19:36.542
- [groans]

19:37.876 --> 19:39.511
She so wants me.

20:01.733 --> 20:05.504
- Look, I'm sorry.
What I did was really wrong.

20:05.571 --> 20:07.573
- Yeah, it kinda was.

20:07.639 --> 20:13.078
- I don't know,
I was just being dumb.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.847
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

20:15.914 --> 20:17.349
- Why would you
go through all that trouble

20:17.416 --> 20:19.318
just to go with me
to a stupid dance?

20:19.384 --> 20:23.822
- Uh, 'cause I wanted
to protect you.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.524
- Protect me?

20:25.591 --> 20:27.559
- Well, yeah.
I mean, you're my friend

20:27.626 --> 20:30.662
and you're a girl,
and, you know guys,

20:30.729 --> 20:33.565
a lot of guys are jerks
and I just didn't want you

20:33.632 --> 20:35.267
going to the dance
with a jerk.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.902
- So to protect me
from going to the dance

20:36.969 --> 20:38.337
with a jerk--

20:38.403 --> 20:40.939
- I know,
I acted like a jerk.

20:41.006 --> 20:42.474
Oh, the irony.

20:44.776 --> 20:47.045
Guess it wasn't the best plan,
huh?

20:47.112 --> 20:48.513
- No.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.881
But it was sweet.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.183
- Sweet?

20:51.249 --> 20:52.484
- Yeah.

20:53.652 --> 20:54.686
But...

20:54.753 --> 20:55.787
- But?

20:55.854 --> 20:57.022
- You're lame
at throwing rocks.

20:57.089 --> 20:58.023
- What?

20:58.090 --> 20:59.524
- Here.

20:59.591 --> 21:01.493
You gotta
snap your wrist and then...

21:03.128 --> 21:04.596
- Nice.
