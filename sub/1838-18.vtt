CRAZY THINGS TO YOU, RAE,

19:24.667 --> 19:26.600
YOU STILL TRIED
TO SAVE US.

19:26.600 --> 19:27.200
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.300
LOOK WHAT THIS COMPETITION
HAS DONE TO US.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.500
IT'S TURNED US
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.567
WELL, LET'S NEVER
LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN,
OK, YOU GUYS?

19:34.567 --> 19:38.133
OK, WE'RE BEST FRIENDS,
AND LET'S STAY THAT WAY.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.100
YEAH.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.500
I LOVE HAPPY ENDINGS.

19:40.500 --> 19:44.767
WELL, I GUESS
WE'LL NEVER KNOW
WHO MESSED US UP THEN.

19:44.767 --> 19:48.300
AAH!

19:50.100 --> 19:53.033
OH, I DID NOT
SEE THAT COMING!

19:53.033 --> 19:54.400
AAH! AAH!

19:54.400 --> 19:55.400
Eddie: REG?

19:55.400 --> 19:58.300
REG? WHAT ARE YOU
DOING UNDERNEATH THERE?

19:58.300 --> 20:00.100
YOU GUYS DIDN'T
DESERVE TO WIN!

20:00.100 --> 20:01.867
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT BUSINESS!

20:01.867 --> 20:02.500
SO IT WAS YOU, HUH?

20:02.500 --> 20:07.734
EVERYONE, REPORT
TO THE FLUB CLUB
IMMEDIATELY.

20:10.567 --> 20:12.200
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.233
I JUST CAN'T STAND...
LOSING.

20:15.233 --> 20:16.767
REG, YOU CAN THINK
ABOUT THAT

20:16.767 --> 20:19.834
WHEN YOU'RE CLEANING UP
THE POPCORN.

20:21.233 --> 20:22.033
AND FOR THE REST OF YOU,

20:22.033 --> 20:24.867
I THINK WE LEARNED
TWO VALUABLE LESSONS TODAY.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.300
COMPETITION CAN BRING OUT
THE WORST IN PEOPLE,

20:27.300 --> 20:33.667
AND NEVER EAT POPCORN
OUT OF AN ITCHING CAP.

20:34.667 --> 20:37.367
SO, UM, SEÑORITA,

20:37.367 --> 20:39.233
WHO'S GETTING
THE SHOPPING SPREE?

20:39.233 --> 20:41.100
WELL, I THINK
THE ONLY FAIR THING

20:41.100 --> 20:43.934
WOULD BE FOR THE 3 OF YOU
TO SHARE IT.

20:43.934 --> 20:44.700
ALL RIGHT.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.734
BUT THERE'S
ANOTHER TWIST.

20:47.734 --> 20:51.900
UNFORTUNATELY,
MOST OF THE MERCHANTS
REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.200
THEY SAID I TOOK
TOO MANY FREEBIES.

20:54.200 --> 20:57.233
BUT I DID MANAGE
TO GET YOU A GIFT CERTIFICATE

20:57.233 --> 21:00.300
TO ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR
STORES IN THE MALL.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.400
AAH!

21:01.400 --> 21:03.600
All: POPCORN TOWN?!

21:03.600 --> 21:06.967
<i>HASTA LA VISTA.</i>

21:07.400 --> 21:09.200
MAN!

21:09.200 --> 21:13.033
WELL, AT LEAST
IT'S FREE.

21:14.867 --> 21:18.200
HEY! I WONDER
WHAT THEY SELL THERE?

21:24.300 --> 21:27.467
DAD, COME ON! YOU'VE BEEN
IN THE HOT TUB FOR 3 DAYS!

21:27.467 --> 21:30.200
YOU'RE GONNA SHRIVEL UP
INTO NOTHING!

21:31.400 --> 21:33.200
TOO LATE!

21:34.400 --> 21:35.800
AAH!

21:35.800 --> 21:37.600
AAH!

21:37.600 --> 21:39.400
AAH! AAH!

21:39.400 --> 21:44.467
OK, IT WAS
JUST A BAD DREAM.

21:44.467 --> 21:46.300
IT WASN'T A DREAM!

21:46.300 --> 21:50.500
AAH! MOMMY!

21:50.867 --> 21:53.367
SON, I WAS JUST CLEANING
UP SOME WATER.

21:53.367 --> 21:56.200
WELL, BACK TO THE TUB.

22:30.100 --> 22:31.100
