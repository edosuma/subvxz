00:03.580 --> 00:06.210

DIRECTION AS THE CONVEYOR BELT.

00:06.250 --> 00:07.590

00:07.630 --> 00:09.000

00:14.140 --> 00:15.390
[WALTER] YEAH, THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN MAN.

00:15.430 --> 00:16.720
[JAKE] ALRIGHT.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.850
A PLANE RIGHT? IT DOESN'T
NEED WHEELS TO TAKE OFF.

00:18.890 --> 00:20.350
[WALTER] YEAH, SO WHAT'S THE
WHOLE POINT OF THAT CHARADE

00:20.390 --> 00:21.270

FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING

00:24.600 --> 00:26.400

[WALTER] YEAH YOU KNOW,
LET ME ASK YOU?

03:05.680 --> 03:10.400
SEE IF YOU HAD A PLANE ON A
CONVEYOR BELT, DO YOU THINK A

03:10.440 --> 03:13.690
PLANE COULD TAKE OFF,
OFF A CONVEYOR BELT?

03:13.730 --> 03:15.820
[JOHNNY] WHAT?

03:15.860 --> 03:18.990
[WALTER] YOU KNOW LIKE IF THE
PLANE AND THE BELT WERE MOVING

03:19.030 --> 03:21.740
[JOHNNY] YEAH, I GUESS.

MOVE TO TAKE OFF. SO YEAH.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.750
IT MIGHT FEEL GOOD TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

04:13.790 --> 04:16.090
I MEAN WE GOT YOU WITH THE BODY.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.670
YOU'RE HOLDING THE GUN, YOU'RE
COVERED IN THE VICTIM'S BLOOD.

04:18.710 --> 04:20.720

04:25.890 --> 04:27.680
[JAKE] ALRIGHT.
[LESLEY] MAYBE YOU WANNA WAIT,

04:28.680 --> 04:29.850
[PIKE] WHAT? YOU--

04:29.890 --> 04:31.850
[LESLEY] JUST DON'T GO AND SAY

04:35.520 --> 04:39.110
[JAKE] LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

04:39.150 --> 04:43.780
YOU GOT THIS AIRPLANE,
TAXIED ON A CONVEYOR BELT.

04:43.820 --> 04:47.780
NOW THE QUESTION IS,
WILL THE AIRPLANE TAKE OFF

04:47.830 --> 04:48.870
OR NOT?

04:48.910 --> 04:51.250
I MEAN IN YOUR
PROFESSIONAL OPINIONS.

04:51.290 --> 04:54.540
NO NEED TO RUSH,
TAKE YOUR TIME.

04:54.580 --> 04:57.590
[PIKE] THE CONVEYOR BELT, IT'S
RUNNING OPPOSITE THE PLANE?

05:07.470 --> 05:10.930
[JAKE] PLANE DOESN'T NEED
STACEY TO TAKE OFF.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.930
[MALACHY] YOUNG LADY HERE
TO SEE YOU.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.690
[JAKE] WHAT?
[MALACHY] STACEY LAYDEN.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.190
[JAKE] OH.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.230
[MALACHY] YEAH.
"OH!"

05:20.570 --> 05:22.650
[STACEY] I'M SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU LIKE THIS.

05:22.690 --> 05:26.610
[JAKE] OH GOD, DON'T BE SO
FOOLISH. HERE PLEASE SIT DOWN.

05:26.660 --> 05:31.290
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO, YOU KNOW,
GO FOR A RUN ANYWAY. SO--

05:31.330 --> 05:33.290
[STACEY] IT'S JUST YOU KNOW,
AFTER I SAW YOU LAST NIGHT,

05:33.330 --> 05:37.670
I UM I-- I COULDN'T SLEEP.
[JAKE] OH YEAH?

05:37.710 --> 05:38.580
WHY?

05:38.630 --> 05:41.380
[STACEY] WELL IT'S JOHNNY.

05:41.420 --> 05:44.800
SOMETHING--
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.220
[JAKE] WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE
WRONG WITH JOHNNY?

05:46.260 --> 05:49.390
[STACEY] WELL IT'S-- YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING "WAS" PERFECT AND

05:49.430 --> 05:51.970
THEN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
I MEAN HE'S DIFFERENT.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.560
AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST NERVES, YOU KNOW.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.150
BUT HE'S BEEN SNEAKING AROUND
MAKING SECRET PHONE CALLS AND

05:59.190 --> 06:01.570
THERE'S PERFUME ON HIS CLOTHES.

06:01.610 --> 06:03.570
[JAKE] WHAT DO YOU THINK, THAT
JOHNNY IS GOING OUT ON YOU?

06:03.610 --> 06:05.820
[STACEY] I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I NEED TO KNOW.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.410
YOU KNOW, BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.070
[JAKE] TOO LA-- TOO LATE?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.490
STACEY YOU KNOW,
YOU MARRIED HIM LIKE YESTERDAY.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.410
[STACEY] I KNOW. BUT I NEED
TO BE SURE, YOU KNOW,

06:14.450 --> 06:16.710
BEFORE THE HONEYMOON.

06:16.750 --> 06:19.920
[JAKE] OKAY.
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:19.960 --> 06:21.670
[STACEY] YOU'RE A
PRIVATE DETECTIVE.

06:21.710 --> 06:26.720
[JAKE] &lt;LAUGHS&gt;
YOU WANNA HIRE ME TO FIND OUT

06:26.760 --> 06:28.630
IF JOHNNY'S GOING OUT ON YOU?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.760
[STACEY] WELL THAT'S
WHAT YOU DO, RIGHT?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.050
[JAKE] YEAH IT'S WHAT I DO.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.600
BUT I DON'T DO IT YOU KNOW,
WITH OLD FRIENDS.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.180
I MEAN I DON'T HAVE
OLD FRIENDS AS CLIENTS.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.230
YOU KNOW LIKE YOU OLD FRIENDS.

06:39.190 --> 06:42.770
[STACEY] I REALIZE
YOU MIGHT STILL HATE ME.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.480
[JAKE] I DON'T HATE YOU. WHY
WOULD I HATE YOU?

06:44.530 --> 06:45.490
I DON'T HATE YOU.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.900
SO...

06:46.940 --> 06:49.450
[STACEY] THAT WAS A LONG TIME
AGO JAKE. LONG TIME AGO

06:49.490 --> 06:51.820
AND I'VE CHANGED.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.870
I NEED YOUR HELP.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.620
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME MONEY,

06:58.660 --> 07:01.580
I WAS SAVING IT FOR
THE DUTY FREE, BUT--

07:01.630 --> 07:03.000
[JAKE] NO, NO, NO, LOOK--

07:03.040 --> 07:04.170
[STACEY] IT-- THERE'S--

07:04.210 --> 07:05.670
[JAKE] I HAVE ANOTHER RULE
OF THUMB, OKAY?

07:05.710 --> 07:08.470
I NEVER STEAL A YOUNG LADIES
DRINKING MONEY.

07:19.390 --> 07:21.020
[MALACHY] IN YOUR SHORT HISTORY
AS A HUMAN BEING,

07:21.060 --> 07:23.440
ONE THING HAS REMAINED TRUE.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.400
EVERY TIME YOU'RE WITHIN
50 YARDS OF STACEY LAYDEN

07:25.440 --> 07:27.490
YOU END UP BROKEN HEARTED
AND A COMPLETE JACKASS!

07:27.530 --> 07:28.950
[JAKE] WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.030
[MALACHY] THE FIRST TIME SHE
DUMPED YOU AT THE TENDER AGE

07:31.070 --> 07:33.950
OF 13, YOU BURNED DOWN THE
GOULD'S REC. CENTER? REMEMBER?

07:33.990 --> 07:36.410
[JAKE] YEAH, BUT THAT WAS AN
ACCIDENT. IT WAS LIKE FAULTY

07:36.450 --> 07:39.250
WIRING OR SOMETHING.
[MALACHY] WHEN SHE BROKE UP WITH

07:39.290 --> 07:41.580
YOU TO GO OUT WITH KEN HYNES
YOU WERE 15. YOU SMASHED

07:41.620 --> 07:43.290
OUT ALL THE SCHOOL WINDOWS.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.130
[JAKE] THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH HER.

07:45.170 --> 07:48.710
[MALACHY] THE LAST TIME SHE
CALLED IT OFF, YOU WERE 18.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.590
YOU STOLE A CAR AND DROVE IT
INTO DEADMAN'S POND.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.640
[JAKE] OH NO! NO ONE EVER
PROVED THAT WAS ME.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.220
[MALACHY] NO PATTERN HERE
FOR YOU?

07:54.260 --> 07:55.560
[JAKE] WOULD YOU MIND YOUR OWN
BUSINESS.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.760
[MALACHY] FINE.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.100
BUT I'M NOT BAILING YOU OUT OF
JAIL AGAIN.

07:58.140 --> 08:01.100
[JAKE] LOOK THAT WAS A LONG
TIME AGO, ALRIGHT?

08:01.140 --> 08:02.520
WE'RE ADULTS NOW.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.570
&lt;JAKE REVS THE CAR ENGINE&gt;

08:08.110 --> 08:09.490
&lt;TIRES SCREECH&gt;

08:15.660 --> 08:18.700
&lt;RAIN&gt;

09:03.370 --> 09:04.790

09:04.830 --> 09:07.130
[BARMAID] CAN I HELP YOU?
[JOHNNY] YEAH, YOU CAN.

09:07.170 --> 09:08.670
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET
A GIRL HERE.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.760
PRETTY, BLONDE.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.460

12:02.930 --> 12:05.350
[MALACHY] JAKE? WHAT ARE YOU AT?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.310
[MALACHY] IF YOU'RE GONNA
DRINK ALONE,

12:08.350 --> 12:11.810
DRINK ALONE IN THE BASEMENT
LIKE THE REST OF US.

12:11.850 --> 12:12.940
[JAKE] I'LL BUY YOU A PINT.

12:12.980 --> 12:15.110
MAKE UP FOR BEING SUCH
A JERK EARLIER TODAY.

12:15.150 --> 12:17.320
[MALACHY] IT'S A
SHADE EARLY BUT...

12:17.360 --> 12:18.730
OKAY!

12:23.990 --> 12:26.950
AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU
JUST WANTED TO SHARE A PINT
WITH THE OLD MAN.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.330
[JAKE] WHAT, DID YOU HIT
YOURSELF IN THE HEAD?

12:28.370 --> 12:29.750
WHY WOULD I EVER WANT
TO DO THAT?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.000
[MALACHY] FALSE PRETENSES,
THIS IS.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.460
[JAKE] YEAH, I KNOW.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.710
IT'S A REAL TWIST OF THE ARM
TO GET YOU UP FOR A PINT.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.300
LOOK, I'M GONNA FOLLOW THE GIRL.

12:39.340 --> 12:41.340
YOU STAY ON JOHNNY.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.930
[MALACHY] AND THAT'S
WHAT I WON'T.

12:46.510 --> 12:49.520
&lt;♪♪&gt;

13:03.400 --> 13:04.990
[JAKE] AH!

13:05.030 --> 13:06.200
[SHEILA] WHY ARE YOU
FOLLOWING ME?

13:06.240 --> 13:08.660
[JAKE] EASY. BUY A GUY DINNER
FIRST AT LEAST.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.000
[SHEILA] YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.660
[MALACHY] JAKE?

13:13.410 --> 13:14.790
[JAKE] &lt;GROANS&gt;

13:21.210 --> 13:22.210
AH!

13:24.050 --> 13:25.550
WHERE THE HELL WERE YOU?

13:25.590 --> 13:27.600
[MALACHY] I HAD TO FINISH
ME PINT.

13:29.970 --> 13:32.020
[STACEY] JAKE, JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.060
[JAKE] STACEY IT'S COMPLICATED.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.140
IT'S VERY COMPLICATED I THINK.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.270
[STACEY] WELL,
WHO WAS HE WITH?

13:37.310 --> 13:39.360
[JAKE] YOU KNOW, JUST GIVE ME
SOME TIME TO FIGURE THIS OUT

13:39.400 --> 13:40.900
AND YOU'LL KNOW BEFORE YOU GO
ON YOUR HONEYMOON.

13:40.940 --> 13:45.400
[STACEY] JUST TELL ME IF HE
WAS WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.990
[JAKE] SORT OF.
[STACEY] SORT OF?

13:48.030 --> 13:48.950
[JAKE] YEAH.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.990
I FOLLOWED HIM TO A MOTEL.

13:54.330 --> 13:57.250
[STACEY] I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
[JAKE] I KNOW, THAT'S--

13:57.290 --> 14:00.210
YOU DID HIRE ME THOUGH TO
FIND OUT IF HE WAS CHEATING
ON YOU RIGHT? SO...

14:00.250 --> 14:02.250
[STACEY] I KNOW. I JUST...

14:04.170 --> 14:06.340
THOUGHT ME AND JOHNNY WAS
DIFFERENT.

14:06.380 --> 14:07.970
[JAKE] YOU AND JOHNNY WAS
DIFFERENT FROM?

14:08.010 --> 14:10.890
[STACEY] DIFFERENT FROM
EVERYBODY ELSE.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.930
[JAKE] I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE,
YOU KNOW THAT?

14:12.970 --> 14:16.600
WE DID GO OUT AT ONE POINT
AND...

14:16.640 --> 14:18.650
I HAVE FEELINGS.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.280
[STACEY] YOU STILL GOT THE
SAME CAR, HUH?

14:24.320 --> 14:26.070
[JAKE] ACTUALLY IT'S A
DIFFERENT CAR, BUT...

14:26.110 --> 14:28.700
[STACEY] IT'S DIFFERENT?
[JAKE] YEAH.

14:28.740 --> 14:30.910
IF YOU WANT WE CAN GO IN THE
BACK SEAT, JUST LIKE OLD TIMES?

14:30.950 --> 14:32.580
[STACEY] YOU WISH.

14:33.910 --> 14:36.250
[JAKE] I THINK WE
SHOULD HAVE A DRINK.

14:36.290 --> 14:38.290
[STACEY] A DRINK WILL BE GOOD.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.110
[STACEY] I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO,
YOU KNOW? I CAN'T GO ON MY

15:02.150 --> 15:06.110
HONEYMOON.... STAY HERE.
[JAKE] YOU COULD YOU KNOW,

15:06.150 --> 15:07.030
GO BACK TO MONTREAL.

15:07.070 --> 15:09.070
[STACEY] I CAN'T GO BACK
TO MONTREAL.

15:10.780 --> 15:13.780
[JAKE] WHY IS THAT?
[STACEY] WELL, I...

15:16.450 --> 15:19.330
STOP ASKING ME QUESTIONS.

15:19.370 --> 15:22.790
I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.130
[JAKE] YOU'RE TROUBLE.

15:25.170 --> 15:27.340
[STACEY] WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO NICE TO ME?

15:27.380 --> 15:29.170
[JAKE] 'CAUSE YOU PAID CASH.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.180
[STACEY] SO WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO ME AND JAKE DOYLE?

15:32.220 --> 15:35.600
[JAKE] AH, YOU MEAN
WHAT EVER HAPPENED BETWEEN
ME AND STACEY LAYDEN?

15:38.060 --> 15:40.060

16:51.420 --> 16:52.930

16:52.970 --> 16:56.050
WHO IS SHE SUPPOSED TO BE?

16:56.090 --> 16:59.260

17:25.580 --> 17:27.040
[JAKE] YEAH, I'M BEGINNING TO
WONDER THAT MYSELF.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.540

PRIVATE DETECTIVE

17:28.590 --> 17:29.590

[FRANK] YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO
HAVE ANYTHING FROM THIS CENTURY,
DO YOU?

19:43.800 --> 19:46.140
[FINN] YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO FIND A GUN IN THIS TOWN?

19:46.180 --> 19:49.980
SHE STILL WORKS FINE.
IN FACT, SHE'S A BIT OF
A TREASURE, YOU KNOW.

19:50.020 --> 19:52.560
THAT GUN SAW ACTION AT
GALLIPOLI WITH THE OLD
NEWFOUNDLAND REGIMENT.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.100
[FRANK] FASCINATING.

19:54.150 --> 19:55.690
[FINN] YEAH WELL, IF YOU DON'T

20:07.160 --> 20:10.160
&lt;♪♪&gt;

20:15.840 --> 20:17.920
[JAKE] WHAT'S ALL THIS?

20:17.960 --> 20:22.380
[LESLIE] THE CAR WAS RENTED IN
ST. JOHNS TO A JOHNNY KILGALLON.

20:22.430 --> 20:23.930
[JAKE] WHERE IS HE?

20:23.970 --> 20:26.430
[LESLIE] DIVERS FOUND HIS WALLET
AND ONE OF HIS SHOES SO FAR.

20:26.470 --> 20:30.230
THE REST OF HIM WAS
PROBABLY CARRIED OUT TO SEA
BY THE CURRENT.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.350
WHERE IS YOUR OLD FRIEND
STACEY, JAKE?

20:32.390 --> 20:34.190
[JAKE] SO JOHNNY KILLED
HIMSELF?

20:34.230 --> 20:36.190
[LESLIE] WELL THAT'S
WHAT I'D BE INCLINED TO THINK,

20:36.230 --> 20:39.860
IF I HADN'T SEEN HIS WIFE
CHASING AFTER HIM AND
ATTACKING HIM IN THE STREET.

20:39.900 --> 20:40.650
[JAKE] IT'S A LITTLE EXTREME.

20:40.690 --> 20:41.900
[LESLIE] I WANT TO TALK TO HER.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.160

20:54.420 --> 21:03.340
[JAKE] YEAH.
[LESLIE] WHERE SHE TO, JAKE?

21:03.380 --> 21:05.720
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW.
[LESLIE] THIS IS A SUSPECT IN

21:05.760 --> 21:07.430
A POTENTIAL HOMICIDE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

21:07.470 --> 21:09.770
[JAKE] OH C'MON! THERE'S NO
WAY THAT STACEY LAYDEN IS

21:09.810 --> 21:11.560
GUILTY OF THROWING SOMEONE OFF
A CLIFF, ALRIGHT?

21:11.600 --> 21:12.600
THAT MUCH I'M SURE OF.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.060
[LESLIE] YEAH, HOW SURE?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.560
[JAKE] WELL YOU KNOW,
PRETTY SURE...

21:16.610 --> 21:19.110
ALMOST... FAIRLY SURE.

21:19.150 --> 21:21.440
LOOK, IF THIS IS ABOUT THIS
MORNING, BECAUSE...

21:21.490 --> 21:24.530
[LESLIE] JAKE FORGET ABOUT
THAT. I GOT EVERYTHING I EVER

21:24.570 --> 21:28.450
WANTED FROM YOU, I'M GOOD.
[JAKE] SO YOU DON'T EVEN WANNA

21:28.490 --> 21:31.200
TALK ABOUT IT?
[LESLIE] YOU SEE YOUR CLIENT,

AND ONLY THEN.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.500

MY CLIENT, I'LL BRING HER TO

21:36.370 --> 21:37.330
I PROMISE.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.900
[MALACHY] YEAH.

RECORD AS YOUR FATHER THOUGH.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.360
[JAKE] UH... NO SIR.

27:41.070 --> 27:44.240
[SHEILA] THE LAST FIVE YEARS
I WAS WORKING ON
JOHNNY KILGALLON,

27:44.280 --> 27:46.830
AND HE'S FINALLY SET TO FLIP
ON FRANK GILLEY.
YOU FAMILIAR WITH HIM?

27:46.870 --> 27:49.040
[JAKE] YEAH,
WE ACTUALLY MET EARLIER.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.460
[SHEILA] BIG FISH IN
THE MONTREAL MAFIA.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.250
JOHNNY WAS
FRANK'S RIGHT HAND MAN.

27:53.290 --> 27:57.130
MY WHOLE CASE WAS JOHNNY
UNTIL HE DECIDED TO FALL
IN LOVE WITH FRANK'S WIFE

27:57.170 --> 27:58.720
AND COMPLETELY LOST HIS MIND.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.260
[MALACHY] YEAH,
THAT'LL HAPPEN WITH HER.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.260
[SHEILA] NOW THEY GOT IT IN HIS
HEAD THAT HE WAS GOING TO

28:03.300 --> 28:06.890
STEAL THE BOSS' WIFE,
STEAL THE BOSSES MONEY,
AND RUN OFF TO IRELAND.

28:06.930 --> 28:08.480
[JAKE] WELL YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

28:08.520 --> 28:10.140
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF
RO-- ROMANTIC.

28:10.190 --> 28:14.230
[SHEILA] INDEED. AND ALL
THAT TROUBLE JUST TO KILL
YOURSELF IN THE END?

28:14.270 --> 28:15.730
FUNNY ISN'T IT?

28:15.770 --> 28:17.690
[JAKE] YEAH IT IS FUNNY,
ISN'T IT?

28:17.730 --> 28:19.860
[SHEILA] SO IN LIEU OF POOR
JOHNNY, I WAS THINKING THAT

28:19.900 --> 28:23.490
FRANK'S ARM CANDY WOULD MAKE
A GOOD SUBSTITUTE STAR WITNESS,

28:23.530 --> 28:26.530
AND SINCE ALL YOU TOWNIES ARE
SO COZY WITH EACH OTHER,

28:26.580 --> 28:28.700
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP
IN FLIPPING HER.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.920
[JAKE] YOU'RE A LITTLE OUT OF
YOUR JURISDICTION THERE,
AREN'T YOU SERGEANT?

28:31.960 --> 28:33.460
[SHEILA] OH...

28:33.500 --> 28:35.540
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

28:35.590 --> 28:38.710
AND TRUST ME,
OUR EYES ARE ON YOU.

28:38.760 --> 28:42.300
AND IF I FIND OUT
YOU'RE WITHHOLDING
ANY DIRT ON MS. STACEY,

28:42.340 --> 28:46.300
I WILL COME DOWN ON

28:46.350 --> 28:49.020
IT'LL SET YOUR CLOCKS
BACK HALF AN HOUR.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.680
CAPEESH?

28:54.350 --> 28:57.110
[MALACHY] WHY GO THROUGH
ALL THAT TROUBLE JUST TO
KILL YOURSELF?

28:57.150 --> 28:58.360
[JAKE] YEAH,
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.570

29:10.160 --> 29:12.460
[LESLIE] THEN TELL ME WHAT
THAT HUGE FIGHT WAS ABOUT?

29:12.500 --> 29:14.210
[STACEY] IT WAS ABOUT ME
AND JAKE.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.790
[LESLIE] WERE YOU HAVING
RELATIONS WITH JAKE DOYLE?

29:15.830 --> 29:17.790
[STACEY] IN HIGH SCHOOL, SURE.

29:17.840 --> 29:18.420
BUT NOT NOW.

29:18.460 --> 29:20.500

29:20.550 --> 29:22.760
[LESLIE] IF YOU AND JAKE WERE
NOTHING THEN WHAT WOULD JOHNNY
BE SO UPSET ABOUT?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.010
[STACEY] HE WAS JEALOUS.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.800
JOHNNY LOVED ME.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.680
I WAS THE SAME WAY ABOUT HIM.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.020
[LESLIE] STILL THAT JEALOUS
HAD TO COME FROM SOMETHING?

29:32.060 --> 29:35.230
[STACEY] WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
[LESLIE] YOU ROLL INTO TOWN,

29:35.270 --> 29:37.230

MAYBE YOU GET A TOUCH OF
THE COLD FEET, AND ALONG COMES
GOOD OLD JAKE FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

29:41.400 --> 29:43.860
ALWAYS GOOD FOR

29:43.900 --> 29:45.030
[STACEY] IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

29:45.070 --> 29:46.570
[LESLIE] IT'S OKAY.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.530
I UNDERSTAND WE ALL HAVE SECOND
THOUGHTS FROM TIME TO TIME.

29:49.580 --> 29:52.000
[STACEY] NO, I NEVER HAD
ANY SECOND THOUGHTS.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.910
NOT ABOUT JOHNNY.
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.920
[LESLIE] NO, EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.960
[MALACHY] I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THIS SUICIDE THING.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.210
IT DOESN'T ADD UP.

30:02.260 --> 30:07.140

LOVEBIRDS OUT OF CLASS.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.060
[AMANDA] WE'RE NOT LOVEBIRDS
OKAY?

30:59.100 --> 31:00.560
[JAKE] OH YEAH?

31:00.600 --> 31:02.440
THEN WHY AM I SEEING YOUR

31:02.480 --> 31:04.230
[JEFF] WE ENDED THINGS THIS

31:04.280 --> 31:05.940

31:05.990 --> 31:08.360
[JAKE] OKAY, WELL EITHER WAY
YOU BOTH WERE CLIFF SIDE

31:08.400 --> 31:10.990
DRINKING A BOTTLE OF PEACH

31:11.030 --> 31:13.740
[JEFF] MAYBE.
[MALACHY] BOOZE...

31:13.790 --> 31:15.080
TRUANCY...

31:15.120 --> 31:18.120
FIRE IN AN UNLICENSED AREA,
LEAVING THE SCENE OF A CRIME.

31:18.160 --> 31:22.170
[JAKE] DEFACING HISTORIC ROCKS.

31:22.210 --> 31:23.920
[MALACHY] THE DNA RESULTS ARE ON
THE WAY BACK FROM THE LAB

31:23.960 --> 31:26.300
RIGHT NOW, J.Z.
[AMANDA] I WANT TO MAKE A DEAL.

31:26.340 --> 31:27.130
[JEFF] SHUT UP.

31:27.170 --> 31:28.220
I'M TELLING HIM.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.800
[JAKE] WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.140
THERE'S NO NEED FOR COMPETITION
HERE. YOU'LL ALL BE FINE IF YOU

31:32.180 --> 31:33.300
BOTH COOPERATE ALRIGHT?

31:33.350 --> 31:35.970

INTERESTING?

31:36.020 --> 31:39.100
[MALACHY] LIKE A FLYING CAR?
[JEFF] WE SAW IT.

31:39.140 --> 31:44.650
[AMANDA] WE SAW EVERYTHING.
[DES] WHERE YOU BEEN?

31:44.690 --> 31:46.190
[JAKE] JOHNNY KILGALLON NEVER
WENT OFF THAT CLIFF,

31:46.230 --> 31:49.280
IN FACT HE'S NOT EVEN--

31:49.320 --> 31:50.950
DEAD.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.040
[JAKE] STUNNED IS NOT EVEN A
WORD I'D USE TO DESCRIBE YOU,

31:58.080 --> 31:59.290

[JAKE] I GOTTA GET STACEY

32:03.040 --> 32:04.960
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL THEM
THAT YOU'RE NOT DEAD?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.050
BOOM! THEY LET HER OUT OF JAIL.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.050
[JOHNNY] IF I TELL THE COPS
THEY'RE GONNA PUT ME IN JAIL.

32:08.090 --> 32:10.300
IF I'M IN JAIL, FRANKS GONNA
MAKE SURE I DON'T LIVE THROUGH
THE FIRST NIGHT.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.510
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
[MALACHY] MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE
THOUGHT THAT THROUGH

32:12.550 --> 32:15.180
BEFORE YOU FAKED YOUR OWN DEATH.
[JOHNNY] YOU GUY'S AREN'T
LISTENING TO ME.

32:15.220 --> 32:18.350
JAIL, WITNESS PROTECTION,
FRANK'S GONNA FIND ME, OKAY?

32:18.390 --> 32:21.480
[JAKE] FRANK GOT HIS MONEY
BACK.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.400

32:35.530 --> 32:37.490
HOLD ON TO IT.

32:37.540 --> 32:41.000
NOW...

32:41.040 --> 32:42.790
SMILE.

32:42.830 --> 32:45.000
[STACEY] JOHNNY WAS THE ONE.

32:45.040 --> 32:48.500
HE MADE ME WANNA CHANGE,
HE WAS DIFFERENT.

32:48.550 --> 32:53.180
[LESLIE] THE QUESTION REMAINS,
IF NOT YOU,

32:53.220 --> 32:57.010
THEN WHO COULD HAVE KILLED
YOUR HUSBAND MS. LAYDEN?

32:58.930 --> 33:00.310

33:24.040 --> 33:26.250
[ROSE] I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.

33:26.290 --> 33:27.040
[MALACHY] OH?

33:27.080 --> 33:29.920
THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

33:29.960 --> 33:33.220
[ROSE] I'M MARRIED.
[MALACHY] SORRY?

33:33.260 --> 33:37.050
[ROSE] HIS NAME IS MARTIN POOLE.
HE JUST GOT OUT OF PRISON.

33:37.090 --> 33:43.020
WE HAVEN'T BEEN TOGETHER
IN YEARS, BUT WE'RE STILL
TECHNICALLY MARRIED.

33:43.060 --> 33:45.190
[MALACHY] RIGHT.
[ROSE] YEAH.

33:45.230 --> 33:48.020
[MALACHY] NICE OF YOU
TO WAIT UNTIL HE'S OUT
OF PRISON TO LET ME KNOW.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.860
[ROSE] WELL HE WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO GET OUT THIS SOON.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.030
MAL, I MEANT TO GET A DIVORCE.

33:53.070 --> 33:58.280
THEN WEEKS WENT BY, AND MONTHS,
AND YEARS AND THEN I MET YOU.

33:58.320 --> 34:00.450
[MALACHY] I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
BELIEVE IN MARRIAGE?

34:00.490 --> 34:03.000
[ROSE] YEAH, MARTIN POOLE IS
THE REASON WHY.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.290
[MALACHY] SUPPOSE A PROPOSAL
NOW WOULD BE IN BAD TASTE.

34:06.330 --> 34:07.960
[ROSE] MALACHY?

34:14.880 --> 34:17.890
&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

34:24.270 --> 34:25.810
[STACEY] JAKE, IS JOHNNY
DEAD OR ALIVE?

34:25.850 --> 34:27.190

[STACEY] OH JAKE WAIT.

34:47.330 --> 34:50.250
WHY ARE YOU DOING

34:50.290 --> 34:52.340
[JAKE] YOU KNOW THAT'S AN
EXCELLENT QUESTION STACEY

34:52.380 --> 34:55.260

35:06.930 --> 35:08.440

NEW YEAR'S EVE,

35:10.230 --> 35:12.860
YOU STOOD ME UP.
WHY?

35:12.900 --> 35:13.770
[STACEY] I WAS 16 JAKE.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.320
I DON'T REMEMBER.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.030
[JAKE] I LOOKED LIKE A TOOL
STACEY! YOU KNOW?

35:18.070 --> 35:20.160
I PAID 20 BUCKS FOR THOSE
TICKETS. MIDNIGHT COMES AROUND

35:20.200 --> 35:21.870
ALL I HAD TO KISS WAS WALTER.

35:21.910 --> 35:24.490
