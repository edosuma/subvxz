WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:02.966
A monastery, 13th century.

00:03.045 --> 00:04.718
Oh, we've gone all medieval.

00:04.963 --> 00:07.182
They're pumping something nasty
off this island.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.722
I think I liked it best
when they were being noisy.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.805
You're a factory.
A 22nd century Army-owned factory.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.141
We Te contractors
and you Te trespassers.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.771
1 need to see your critical systems.I.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.851
Which one?

00:17.935 --> 00:18.936
You know which one.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.989
They have to be destroyed.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.820
It's alive, so alive.
You're piling your lives,

00:23.899 --> 00:25.776
your personalities directly into it.

00:30.822 --> 00:34.167
You gave them your lives.
Human lives are amazing.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.291
Are you surprised
they walked off with them?

00:36.495 --> 00:37.496
This is...

00:37.913 --> 00:39.005
You're telling me.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.424
Why are you really here?

00:40.499 --> 00:42.342
They're monsters. Mistakes.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.716
They have to be destroyed.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.932
If we want to live,
then it's time to go to war.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.430
They're coming back.
In a big way.

00:51.510 --> 00:55.606
Yes, It's insane. And It 's about to get
even more insanerer.

00:55.681 --> 00:57.103
Trust me.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.186
I'm the Doctor.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.901
What's happening?

01:08.485 --> 01:12.740
One day we will get back? Yes, one day.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.953
Reverse the polarity
of the neutron flow.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.504
The Flesh is struggling to cope
with our past regenerations. Hold on!

01:22.374 --> 01:23.876
Would you like a jelly baby?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.091
Why? Why?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.214
- Why?
- Why? Why? What?

01:29.715 --> 01:31.217
Hello, I'm the Doctor.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.678
No, let it go. If we've moved on...

01:34.136 --> 01:35.979
Hold on, hold on! You can stabilise.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.773
I've reversed the jelly baby
with the neutron flow.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.567
And now, would you like a...

01:40.642 --> 01:42.940
- Doctor, Doctor...
- No!

01:43.020 --> 01:45.899
I'm the... I'm the...

01:47.566 --> 01:50.445
- I can't...
- No, listen, hold on, hold on.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.700
Nooo!

02:45.874 --> 02:47.467
I think I liked it best
when they were being noisy.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.627
Mmm-hmm.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.893
Doctor, we need you, get over here.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.679
Hello.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.102
- Doctor.
- Cybermats.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.774
- Do we have time for this?
- We make time.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.227
- I'd like more proof that you're me.
- Cybermats.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.779
Created by the Cybermen.
They kill by feeding off brain waves.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.856
Are you sure there aren't any weapons
they could get to,

03:09.940 --> 03:11.283
like big guns with bits on?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.826
Yeah, big guns would be good right now.

03:12.901 --> 03:16.246
Why would we have guns?
We're a factory, we mine...

03:21.159 --> 03:22.251
Acid.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.377
Rory and Amy,
they may not trust both of us.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.428
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Inevitably.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.007
- You see, I'm glad we're on the same...
- Wavelength. See? Great minds.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.842
Exactly. So, what's the plan?

03:36.925 --> 03:39.428
- Save them all, humans and Gangers.
- Tall order, sounds wonderful.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.185
- Is that what you were thinking?
- Yes, it's just so inspiring

03:42.222 --> 03:43.348
to hear me say it.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.517
- I know.
- Doctor, come on!

03:46.893 --> 03:50.568
- So, what now, Doctor?
- Well, time to get cracking, Doctor.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.367
Hello! Sorry.

03:54.443 --> 03:57.413
- But we had to establish a few...
- Ground rules. Formulate a...

03:57.487 --> 03:59.410
- Protocol.
- Protocol. Very posh.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.162
No, no. A protocol between us,
otherwise...

04:01.241 --> 04:03.744
- It gets horribly embarrassing.
- Potentially confusing.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.330
Okay. Well, I'm glad you solved
the problem of confusing.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.879
- That's sarcasm.
- She's very good at sarcasm.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.050
- Breathe.
- What?

04:11.126 --> 04:12.799
- We have to get you outside.
- And the Gangers, too.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.721
Sorry. Would you like a memo
from the last meeting?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.548
- They are trying to kill us!
- They're scared.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.132
Doctor, we're trapped in here.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.310
Right. See, I don't think so.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.059
The Flesh Bowl is filled by cabling
from above.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.765
But where are
the earthing conduits, hmm?

04:24.848 --> 04:28.898
All this piping must go down
into a tunnel or a shaft or something.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.604
Yes? With us?

04:32.898 --> 04:35.572
Yowza! An escape route.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.529
You know, I'm just starting to get
a sense of just how impressive it is

04:38.612 --> 04:39.989
to hang out with me.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.416
- Do you tend to say "yowza"?
- That's enough. Let it go, okay?

04:44.075 --> 04:45.622
We're under stress.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.607
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.349
The Army will send a recon team out.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.055
We need to find a way
to contact the mainland.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.731
What about Rory and Jen?
They are both out there.

05:48.807 --> 05:49.979
No, this place is a maze.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.401
Takes a long time to find someone
in a maze.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.353
I bet you lot have got
a computer map, haven't you?

05:53.436 --> 05:55.814
If we can get power running and
scan for them, it'll be a lot quicker.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.906
Doctor, you said earlier to breathe.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.363
Very important, Pond, breathe.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.118
Yeah, well, I'm struggling to.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.373
Acid interacting with the stone.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.500
Creating an asphyxiant miasma.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.249
- A what?
- Chokey gas.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.460
Extra heavy. If we can get above it...

06:16.626 --> 06:18.424
The evac tower. This way!

06:22.757 --> 06:25.135
Damned headaches.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.683
So tired.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.269
They could be anywhere.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.230
- How are we going to find them?
- Think about it.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.904
With all that gas out there,
my guess would be the evac tower.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.856
Get above it, try to get power up.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.651
So, let's stop them.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.829
It's a narrow doorway.
I could defend it easy enough.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.739
So can she.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.714
I think I've coughed so hard
I've pulled a muscle or something.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.259
It's okay. It's easing off. Whoo! Okay.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.217
Midnight.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.845
It's Adam's birthday.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.430
My son's five.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.517
Happy birthday, bud.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.818
Happy birthday, Adam.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.535
He'll be so excited.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.321
Out of bed at the crack of dawn.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.495
It's funny.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.453
He's got this wee dance he does
when he gets over-excited.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.965
Listen to me.
I tried to block the memories,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.509
but now I know, I must remember.

07:39.918 --> 07:43.889
It's the eyes.
The eyes are the last to go.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.594
What are you talking about?

07:45.674 --> 07:49.224
When they destroy us,
the eyes are the last things to melt.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.013
And there's one question in those eyes.

07:52.097 --> 07:53.098
Why?

07:54.641 --> 07:58.236
Why should we suffer
for the sake of human beings?

08:00.021 --> 08:02.365
I heard in India there's over
10 million Gangers.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.409
We can reach out.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.949
Inspire them to rise up.

08:07.028 --> 08:11.033
Revolution? Look, I just...

08:11.616 --> 08:14.039
I just want to be left
to live in peace, Jen.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.047
They will melt you.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.052
Have you become so human
that you've forgotten the truth?

08:22.419 --> 08:25.047
Don't you remember all the times
you were decommissioned?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.349
- Or should I say executed?
- No.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.308
We don't remember.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.887
Well, I do.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.269
It's us or them.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.684
She's right.

09:02.959 --> 09:03.960
I have a plan.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.723
And it'll destroy them all.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.225
Can you really get the power back?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.230
There's always some power
floating around...

09:16.306 --> 09:18.434
Sticking to the wires like bits of lint.

09:18.516 --> 09:21.235
- Can you stop finishing each other's...
- Sentences?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.738
- No probs.
- Yes.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.280
No, but hang on. You said that
the Tardis was stuck in acid.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.405
So won't she be damaged?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.203
- Nah...
- She's a tough old thing.

09:30.278 --> 09:33.157
Tough, old, sexy.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.662
No, tough, dependable, sexy.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.247
- I can't get it out of there.
- Come on.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.671
Okay, how can you both be real?

09:39.746 --> 09:43.216
Well, because we are. I'm the Doctor.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.173
Yeah, and so am I.
We both contain the knowledge

09:45.251 --> 09:46.878
of over 900 years of
memory and experience.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.713
We both wear the same bow tie,
which is cool.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.424
- Because bow ties are...
- And always will be.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.351
But how did the Flesh read you?
Because you weren't linked up to it.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.928
Well, it must have been
after I examined it.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.605
- Thus a new, genuine Doctor was created.
- Ta-da!

09:57.972 --> 10:00.646
No getting away from it.
One of you was here first.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.154
Well, okay, after the Flesh scanned me,
I had an accident with a puddle of acid.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.572
Now new shoes,

10:05.897 --> 10:08.616
a situation which did not confront
me learned self here.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.446
That satisfy you, Pond?

10:13.530 --> 10:14.952
Don't call me Pond, please.

10:18.910 --> 10:19.957
What?

10:20.036 --> 10:22.585
Interesting. You definitely feel
more affection for him than me.

10:23.123 --> 10:27.424
No. No, I... Look, you're fine
and everything, but he's the Doctor.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.340
No of fence. Being almost the Doctor
is pretty damn impressive.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.430
Well, being almost the Doctor is like
being no Doctor at all.

10:34.509 --> 10:35.601
Don't overreact.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.891
- You might as well call me Smith.
- Smith?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.770
- John Smith!
- Yes! Communication a go go.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.111
Find Rory, show me the scanning
tracking screen.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.443
Come on, Rory, let's be having you.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.944
There's no sign of him
anywhere.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.530
Come on, come on, baby, show yourself.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.161
You're right. There's power.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.624
Now, boys, I don't know much,
but I know my own minds.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.701
She'll be straight on the comm link
to the mainland.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.754
St john's calling. Emergency Alpha...

11:02.829 --> 11:04.297
Let's see if we can intercept.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.592
St John's is calling the mainland
Are you receiving me, Captain?

11:08.084 --> 11:09.085
Come in.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.381
We'll never get a signal
through this storm.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.260
St john's calling the mainland...

11:17.927 --> 11:19.850
Come in, this is urgent.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.061
We 're just about
reading you, St John's.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.141
How are you doing?

11:23.224 --> 11:24.646
We've had all kinds of trouble here.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.650
Request immediate evacuation.
We Te under attack.

11:27.729 --> 11:30.448
The storm's affected our Gangers.
They're running amok.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.406
- Your Gangers?
- Yes, our Gangers are attacking us.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.862
We need you to take us
off the island immediately

11:35.945 --> 11:37.538
and wipe them out.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.338
Copy that, St John's.
Shuttle is dispatched Hang on.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.837
You'll need to airlift us off the roof
of the evac tower.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.753
And, Captain, any further transmission
sent by me

11:51.836 --> 11:55.010
must come with the following code word,
I'm typing It

11:55.882 --> 11:57.225
in case there listening in!

11:57.300 --> 11:59.268
Oof, see how smart I am?

11:59.344 --> 12:00.812
That's why I'm paid the big bucks.

12:00.887 --> 12:05.108
Got it. We 'll swing in,
get you out and decommission the Flesh.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.111
Jennifer's right.

12:12.190 --> 12:15.285
We're going to have to fight
if we want to survive.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.876
Thermostatic override rejected.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.128
Can only be operated
by a recognised source.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.424
I am recognised.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.423
I'm Jennifer Lucas.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.007
Oh!

12:37.757 --> 12:39.885
We're going to get out of here.
We are, we're going to get out.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.311
But we're not leaving without them.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.480
I want him found, too,
but it's about casualties, isn't it?

12:43.554 --> 12:44.555
Can't be helped.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.475
What are you doing?

12:47.558 --> 12:48.605
- Making a phone call.
- Who to?

12:48.685 --> 12:49.811
No one yet. It's on delay.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.773
Right. Not getting it.
Why exactly are you making a phone call?

12:52.855 --> 12:55.904
Because, Amy, I am
and always will be the optimist.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.705
The hoper of far-flung hopes
and dreamer of improbable dreams.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.417
Wheels are in motion. Done.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.211
Do you know, really,
there could be only one.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.964
- Hmm?
- Ah, nothing. Carry on.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.419
Be amazing.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.832
Amy, what happened?

13:49.370 --> 13:51.714
- It's her again.
- It's who again?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.209
There's a woman I keep seeing,
a woman with an eye patch.

13:54.292 --> 13:57.887
And she has this habit of sliding
walls open and staring at me.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.048
- Doctor?
- Nothing.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.473
Doesn't seem like nothing.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.472
It's time memory, like a mirage.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.269
It's nothing to worry about.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.896
It's in my head.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.477
- Hey, hold on.
- Don't go!

14:12.560 --> 14:14.233
No, leave it to me.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.629
I'm sorry.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.750
What I said about you being
almost the Doctor, it's just...

14:36.292 --> 14:40.297
It's just really hard because
I've been through so much with him.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.215
I've even seen...

14:43.341 --> 14:45.890
I've even seen the moment of his...

14:47.387 --> 14:48.809
Can you die?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.733
If you really are the same,
then you can die,

14:51.808 --> 14:54.027
you can be killed and...

14:56.020 --> 14:58.193
I might have seen that happen.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.653
- Why?
- Why?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.659
Because you invited us to see it.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.453
Your death...

15:09.075 --> 15:11.043
- Why?
- You're hurting me.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.247
It's all the eyes say. Why?

15:14.163 --> 15:15.756
I can feel them.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.051
As they work each day, knowing the time
was coming for them

15:18.126 --> 15:19.423
to be thrown away again!

15:19.460 --> 15:21.838
Not again! Please!

15:21.921 --> 15:24.094
And then they are destroyed
and they feel death.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.847
And all they can say is, "Why?"

15:40.940 --> 15:42.066
Why?

15:43.609 --> 15:45.737
Keep him away from me!

15:46.946 --> 15:48.368
Did you sense it?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.121
Briefly, not as strong as you.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.789
Amy, I'm sorry.

15:52.869 --> 15:55.213
No! Hey, you keep away.
We can't trust you.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.757
It would appear
I can connect to the Flesh.

15:57.832 --> 15:58.833
No, you are Flesh.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.213
I'm beginning to understand what
he's been through,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.136
- what he needs.
- What you want. You are it!

16:02.253 --> 16:05.177
It's much more powerful than we thought.
The Flesh can grow, correct?

16:05.256 --> 16:07.054
Its cells can divide.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.435
Well, now it wants to do that at will.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.016
It wants revenge.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.644
It's in pain, angry.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.771
It wants revenge.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.319
I was right, you're not the Doctor,
you can't ever be.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.068
- You're just a copy.
- Doctor?

16:25.651 --> 16:28.780
It might be best if you stayed
over there for now. Hmm?

16:28.821 --> 16:30.243
Hold on a minute. Hold your horses.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.246
I thought I'd explained this,
I'm him, he's me.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.204
Doctor, we have no issue with you.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.959
But when it comes to your Ganger...

16:37.038 --> 16:39.257
Don't be so absurd.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.251
Buzzer.
- Sure, boss.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.638
Take a seat, mate.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.266
Nice barrel, very comfy.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.805
Why not?

16:54.388 --> 16:55.890
Is this really what you want?

17:04.690 --> 17:07.443
Help me! No! Get away!

17:07.527 --> 17:08.618
Jen?

17:11.239 --> 17:12.240
Jen!

17:15.284 --> 17:16.410
Rory?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.330
I'm sorry, she found me.

17:20.623 --> 17:23.172
- Rory, listen to me.
- Don't listen to her.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.003
I'm Jennifer Lucas, this woman is Flesh.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.852
7' his is the shuttle.
We 're right above you.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.186
But we can't get low enough.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.314
Gamma static could fry our nav controls.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.437
Sit tight we 'll get you. Just...

17:41.060 --> 17:43.358
Hello? Can you hear me?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.319
I can't find Row. I'm going out there.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.615
We could use the sonic to track him.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.944
Humans and Gangers give off
slightly different signals,

17:49.026 --> 17:50.494
the sonic needs to tell the difference.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.538
Oh, so the sonic knows
Gangers are different.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.741
- So the other Doctor is different.
- He is the Doctor.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.701
Not to me, I can tell.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.293
Sure you're not prejudiced?

17:58.369 --> 17:59.495
Nice try. But I know, okay?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.957
We've been through too much.
You're my Doctor, end of.

18:02.206 --> 18:03.503
So, one of you is human.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.420
And one of you
I sat with and talked with.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.429
Why can't you just tell me the truth?

18:09.422 --> 18:12.016
The Doctor wants you to live
and I'm with him all the way.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.552
That's a lovely idea, Rory.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.722
But the Flesh want to kill us now.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.475
You're limping. You're not.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.560
So?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.486
So what? You think a Ganger
can't put on a limp?

18:24.562 --> 18:26.064
Show me your leg.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.946
It got burnt while I was in the harness.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.654
She's lying.
She's telling you what you want to hear.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.239
Look, you can't fake a burn.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.373
No! No! You don't...

18:38.743 --> 18:41.747
Stop it! Stop it!

18:41.829 --> 18:43.923
Fighting each other is pointless.
Come on!

18:44.915 --> 18:46.917
Please, please, stop!

18:47.668 --> 18:51.593
Jen! Both Jens, stop it!

18:53.633 --> 18:54.634
No!

19:00.431 --> 19:03.150
She attacked me. I didn't...

19:10.024 --> 19:12.152
I knew you'd find me.

19:12.234 --> 19:16.159
We're in this together, Row.
And we've got to trust each other.

19:16.739 --> 19:20.744
Okay. Come on, let's go.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.843
Hey, there's a camera up.
We've got a visual.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.046
That's Rory and Jennifer.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.387
They're heading
for the thermostatic room.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.801
Let's go get them.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.013
Hang on.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.148
You can't let him go.
Are you crazy?

19:43.224 --> 19:45.773
Am I crazy, Doctor?

19:46.060 --> 19:48.483
Well, you did once plumb your brain
into the core of an entire planet

19:48.562 --> 19:50.656
just to hold its orbit and win a bet.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.654
He can't go rescue them. I'm going.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.361
Do you know, I want him to go.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.579
And I'm rather adamant.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.501
Well, then, they'll need company.
Right, boss?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.128
It's fine. I'll handle it.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.718
Thank you, Buzzer.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.174
It'll be all right.

20:16.257 --> 20:17.850
I'll find him.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.143
Can't explain it to you now,
but I need you to trust him.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.853
Can you do that for me, Amy?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.354
And what if you're wrong?

20:30.479 --> 20:34.484
This is the thermostatic chamber.
We can stir the oxygen supply from here.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.568
Uh, what?

20:36.277 --> 20:38.826
We're going to choke to death
if we don't clean this air.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.781
Keep a look out in case of Gangers.

20:48.122 --> 20:49.669
JENNIFER; Rory!

20:50.875 --> 20:51.967
What's wrong?

20:52.042 --> 20:55.216
It's this wheel, it's just too tough
for a girl to turn.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.014
You feeling strong?

20:57.465 --> 20:59.342
I'll break out the big guns.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.889
This first.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.392
Human source recognised.

21:13.230 --> 21:15.699
Thermostatic override granted.

21:17.860 --> 21:20.079
These temperature gauges are rising.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.579
Jennifer and Rory must've shut off
the underground cooling vents.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.125
Why do that? It'll kill us.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.875
There's a million gallons
of boiling acid under our feet.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.170
I know, it's heating up
the whole island.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.294
How long until it blows?

21:34.168 --> 21:36.842
Gangers or no Gangers,
we need to get the hell out of here.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.680
Shuttle, we need evac.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.846
Where are you? Can you hear me?

21:40.925 --> 21:42.552
- Can you...
- Cleaves?

21:42.635 --> 21:45.013
- Cleaves? Cleaves, sit down.
- I'm fine.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.938
You don't look good.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.736
Monsters never do.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.148
I'm fine.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.450
I remember medics doing tests.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.323
I'm waiting for results, so let it go.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.654
It's a very deep parietal clot.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.114
How can you possibly...

22:06.200 --> 22:07.747
Inoperable?

22:07.827 --> 22:08.919
On Earth, yes.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.792
Well, seeing as Earth's all that's on...

22:12.873 --> 22:15.672
.offer. Hmm.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.422
I'm no healthy spring chicken
and you're no weatherman, right?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.426
Something just cracked, I heard it.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.852
Yeah, we can't stay here. Let's go!

22:24.927 --> 22:27.350
- He's right, let's shift!
- Cleaves to shuttle, respond.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.148
We need to move and we can't be
collected from the evac tower.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.355
- Give us the code word.
- The code word is...

22:36.438 --> 22:40.068
Cleaves, Cleaves, it's dead! It's dead.
We need to get out of here.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.653
We need to get back downstairs
and get those vents back on! Come on!

22:43.904 --> 22:47.124
This is our chance. How can we route
the shuttle to the courtyard?

22:47.199 --> 22:48.576
You can't guess the code word.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.912
Yes, I can, jimmy,
because I created the code word.

22:50.995 --> 22:53.498
Shuttle, do you read me?
This is Foreman Cleaves.

22:54.582 --> 22:58.007
Cleaves you... You got cut off
Say again. What is the request?

22:58.085 --> 22:59.928
You need to reroute and pick us up
from the courtyard.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.051
Courtyard?

23:01.255 --> 23:03.508
As soon as we can.
Give me the code word.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.935
Shuttle, the code word is Bad Boy.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.058
I repeat, Bad Boy.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.523
Copy that. The courtyard.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.525
Still want us
to take care of those Gangers?

23:16.604 --> 23:19.403
Negative. They've all been incinerated.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.904
Bad Boy.

23:22.067 --> 23:23.068
Good call.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.114
Yeah, well, it wasn't luck.

23:26.196 --> 23:28.039
We're the same person.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.506
This room's always sealed.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.175
Power surge must've thrown the bolts.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.390
What is that?

23:48.052 --> 23:50.896
Discarded Flesh. Faulty, probably.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.224
Just thrown away. Look at them.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.442
One of my old Gangers.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.491
Left to rot, fully conscious.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.664
Can you imagine
what kind of hell they're in?

24:08.948 --> 24:12.828
But Cleaves...
The company, how could they do this?

24:13.202 --> 24:14.704
How could they?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.755
Who are the real monsters?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.878
We can't let this carry on.

24:22.378 --> 24:24.756
Jen, we have to make people see.

24:26.757 --> 24:29.055
Okay, Rory, I have an idea.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.887
You came for me. We have a bond, right?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.814
We trust each other.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.192
- Yeah.
- So, trust me on this.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.735
I'm getting something.

24:42.815 --> 24:43.941
- Is it human?
- Yeah, it's human.

24:44.024 --> 24:47.244
But it's fading, it's fading!
This is bad. Fading is very...

24:47.361 --> 24:48.908
bad.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.367
- The signal's gone.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.492
She's dead.

24:54.034 --> 24:55.877
She was hanging to
the edge of life

24:55.953 --> 24:58.752
but she just, just slipped away.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.842
Jennifer, I'm so sorry.

25:03.252 --> 25:06.256
Oh, she's been out here for hours.

25:06.380 --> 25:09.259
But if the real Jen's been
lying out here...

25:10.217 --> 25:11.469
Rory's in trouble.

25:15.139 --> 25:19.861
Sorry, pal. It's boss' orders.
Us and them, innit?

25:26.191 --> 25:27.238
Ah.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.154
The eyes have it.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.287
Why are they here?

25:35.242 --> 25:39.042
To accuse us.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.958
Ignore them, it's not far.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.019
I should've been a postman like me dad.

26:00.100 --> 26:03.900
I'm here, I'm here.

26:06.190 --> 26:07.567
I'm with you.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.912
I know, it hurts.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.871
I'm sorry.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.543
Go to sleep.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.045
Sleep.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.920
You killed her.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.793
You killed our Jen.

26:28.837 --> 26:31.135
And I'm stronger, Buzz.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.432
I can grow.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.824
It's a chemical chain reaction now.
I can't stop it.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.989
This place is going to blow sky high.

26:56.073 --> 26:57.495
Exactly how long have we got?

26:57.574 --> 27:00.919
An hour? Five seconds?
Somewhere in between.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.547
Out!

27:07.876 --> 27:09.219
Oh, all right.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.422
- Oh, Rory, oh, Row.
- Oh.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.007
There's a way out, Jennifer found it.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.763
A secret tunnel under the crypt.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.015
From the crypt?
It's not on the schematics.

27:17.094 --> 27:20.143
It leads right out of the monastery,
maybe even under the Tardis, Doctor.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.272
Follow me.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.150
Ah.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.664
Got anything for a sore head?

27:38.782 --> 27:43.083
This is how they'll always treat us.
Do you see now?

27:43.954 --> 27:46.377
After all, you're one of us,

27:46.456 --> 27:47.457
Doctor.

27:49.126 --> 27:51.629
Call me Smith.

27:52.713 --> 27:53.714
John Smith.

27:57.467 --> 27:59.265
We can't leave without Buzzer!

27:59.344 --> 28:01.062
I'll go back for him.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.312
Uh, Doctor, look, I'd better tell you,
I haven't been quite straight with you.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.392
Rory!

28:06.351 --> 28:07.773
Hang on, Jen, we don't want to
lock them out.

28:07.853 --> 28:09.150
We should just show them
what we've found.

28:09.229 --> 28:10.731
I don't think so.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.409
1 0 (D. 0 0 C 0 -v 0 DC

28:15.986 --> 28:19.331
They've been throwing away
old Flesh and leaving it to rot

28:19.406 --> 28:20.407
alive!

28:20.616 --> 28:21.959
I think the world should see that.

28:22.034 --> 28:25.163
Rory, there is no time.
This factory's about to explode!

28:25.245 --> 28:26.963
Are you sure about this?

28:27.456 --> 28:28.878
'Cause I'm not. Let them out.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.211
- The little girl got strong.
- What?

28:32.502 --> 28:35.051
The little girl lost on the moors
in her red wellies,

28:35.130 --> 28:36.803
looking for a way home.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.677
Well, she got strong, Rory.

28:41.470 --> 28:44.269
- I told you, remember?
- But that wasn't...

28:45.432 --> 28:47.560
It was the other Jennifer that told me
about being a little girl.

28:47.643 --> 28:48.690
Oh?

28:49.853 --> 28:51.730
What other Jennifer?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.741
Well, the...

28:55.442 --> 28:56.489
The, uh...

28:56.860 --> 28:59.409
Wait, you tricked me. Let me go,
I'm opening the door, let me...

28:59.488 --> 29:00.580
I'm sorry!

29:02.407 --> 29:03.408
No!

29:10.207 --> 29:11.834
We have to be free.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.803
I'm sorry, too, Miranda.

29:14.878 --> 29:18.257
Of all the humans in all the world,
you had to pick the one with the clot.

29:21.176 --> 29:25.022
But hey, them's the breaks!
Welcome to the human race.

29:36.692 --> 29:38.911
This is going to overheat
and fill the room with acid.

29:39.027 --> 29:40.153
Just as a point of interest.

29:40.946 --> 29:43.199
- And we can't stop it?
- Just as a point of interest?

29:43.282 --> 29:44.875
- No.

29:46.827 --> 29:50.548
You created another Ganger
just to trick me. You tricked me!

29:50.580 --> 29:53.083
When I found you, you were both Flesh.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.045
And you tricked me into trusting you!

29:58.463 --> 29:59.931
Jen's dead.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.015
- Isn't she?
- She's gone, Rory! Gone!

30:04.094 --> 30:06.688
Shuttle. We Te dropping down
on our approach.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.606
Stand by for evac.

30:08.890 --> 30:11.234
The humans will be melted,
as they deserve.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.404
And then the factory will be destroyed.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.482
Once we get to the mainland,
the real battle begins.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.659
The humans won't stand a chance.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.863
You're one of us, Doctor.
Join the revolution.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.623
I've got to go and get them out!

30:33.290 --> 30:34.542
It'll never hold her.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.460
If you have a better plan, I'm all ears.

30:36.585 --> 30:39.134
In fact, if you have a better plan,
I'll take you to a planet

30:39.212 --> 30:41.306
where everyone is all ears.

30:42.716 --> 30:44.343
Doctor, we can't just let them die.

30:46.053 --> 30:48.147
- Ring ring.
- Doctor!

30:48.221 --> 30:49.848
Ring ring!

30:51.767 --> 30:52.814
Oh...

30:53.727 --> 30:55.570
The acid's eating through.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.407
- Stay!
- Okay.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.242
Ah, that'll be the phone.
Somebody get the phone.

31:08.325 --> 31:11.499
Jimmy, get the phone.
No, fine, I'll get the phone. Stay put.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.462
Thank you for booking
your holo-call with Morpeth Jetsan.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.219
Ah! Hello, madam.

31:23.340 --> 31:27.015
I'm the Doctor. Well, other Doctor.
Well, Smith.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.893
It's complicated and boring.
Anyway, who cares? It's your birthday!

31:30.972 --> 31:32.349
1 0 1 - L,

31:32.557 --> 31:35.060
Now, have you been getting up
very early and jumping on the bed?

31:35.143 --> 31:36.486
Yes; really high.

31:36.561 --> 31:37.983
I expect chocolate for breakfast.

31:38.021 --> 31:40.524
If you don't feel sick by mid-morning,
you're not doing it right.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.656
Now, I think you want to speak to Dad.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.736
Yes yes yes yes yes.

31:45.821 --> 31:46.822
Daddy?

31:49.116 --> 31:50.368
You'll do, jimmy.

31:51.368 --> 31:54.497
What does the other jimmy matter now?
You're both the same dad, aren't you?

31:58.041 --> 31:59.384
Come on. Adam's waiting.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.134
Daddy..

32:04.381 --> 32:07.851
Daddy what's that rumbly noise?

32:08.009 --> 32:10.182
What? Going on, Daddy?

32:10.762 --> 32:11.809
Daddy?

32:11.888 --> 32:14.732
You tricked him into an act
of weakness, Doctor.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.024
No, I've helped him
into an act of humanity.

32:18.895 --> 32:22.149
Anyone else like the sound
of that act of humanity?

32:22.315 --> 32:25.785
Dicken, drain the acid well
in Crypt One.

32:25.861 --> 32:28.284
- Don't you dare!
- I've had it with this.

32:28.363 --> 32:31.242
What's the point in this ridiculous war?

32:32.367 --> 32:33.994
Look at you, Jen.

32:34.161 --> 32:37.290
You were a sweet kid. Look at you now.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.716
The stuff of nightmares.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.304
I don't want my world
populated by monsters.

32:46.381 --> 32:50.682
You can't stop the factory
from melting down, boss.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.555
I'll take revenge on humanity
with or without you.

32:53.638 --> 32:55.515
It doesn't have to be about revenge.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.442
It can be so much better than that.

33:24.044 --> 33:25.341
Let me through!

33:29.799 --> 33:32.427
There's nothing we can do.
The acid's reached his heart.

33:35.096 --> 33:38.475
- Hang in there, mate.
- I'm quite handsome from this angle.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.524
I'm sorry.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.239
I'm the fake.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.164
Adam deserves his real dad.

33:52.322 --> 33:55.075
- Shut up.
- What do you want me to do?

33:56.409 --> 33:57.456
Anything.

33:58.995 --> 33:59.996
Just say.

34:01.331 --> 34:03.333
The way things are, mate,

34:04.960 --> 34:06.712
it's up to you now.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.264
Be a dad.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.149
You remember how.

34:35.699 --> 34:39.875
Jimmy Wicks, you're a dad.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.938
Daddy? Where Cs' my daddy?

35:21.077 --> 35:22.545
Daddy it's me.

35:24.581 --> 35:28.302
Hey, sunshine.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.302
What are you up to?

35:30.420 --> 35:32.263
Opening all my presents.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.174
Ah, good lad.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.975
You have fun today.

35:37.010 --> 35:41.436
And remember your dad,
he loves you very, very much.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.683
When are you coming home?

35:45.852 --> 35:48.901
- Daddy's coming home today, Adam.
- Yay!

35:54.486 --> 35:55.612
Now we need to move.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.011
Run. Run!

36:12.087 --> 36:13.259
Run!

36:20.929 --> 36:22.772
Ooh, roof's going to give.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.977
We have to stop her!
This door doesn't lock!

36:27.060 --> 36:29.028
No, but the far one does.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.473
- No!

37:00.510 --> 37:01.978
Here she comes.

37:06.683 --> 37:07.855
Whoa!

37:08.935 --> 37:11.563
Oh! She does like to make an entrance!

37:14.232 --> 37:15.324
Get on the move!

37:16.901 --> 37:19.780
- Go, go, go!
- Get aboard! Go!

37:19.821 --> 37:20.822
I'm not leaving.

37:24.242 --> 37:25.334
Go!

37:31.583 --> 37:33.426
Hey, hey. Now's our chance.

37:33.501 --> 37:35.754
I have to stay, hold this door closed.
Give you time to dematerialise.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.931
Oh, don't be crazy.
Okay, what happens to you, hmm?

37:38.006 --> 37:40.179
Well, this place
is just about to explode.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.384
But I can stop her.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.682
Both of you can survive this.
I mean, there has to be a way.

37:43.762 --> 37:47.141
Or perhaps you think
I should stay instead, Mr Smith?

37:49.058 --> 37:50.480
No, of course not.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.312
But look, this man, I've flown with him.

37:52.645 --> 37:55.319
You know? And you are amazing,
and yeah, I misjudged you.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.867
But you're not him, I'm sorry.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.696
Amy, we swapped shoes.

38:02.489 --> 38:05.117
- I'm the Doctor.
- And I'm the Flesh.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.702
You can't be. You're the real him.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.754
No, I'm not
and I haven't been all along.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.086
- What?
- I'm the original Doctor, Amy.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.667
We had to know
if we were truly the same.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.798
It was important, vital we learn
about the Flesh.

38:15.877 --> 38:18.801
And we could only do that
through your eyes.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.401
I never thought it possible.

38:32.018 --> 38:33.019
What?

38:33.937 --> 38:36.736
You're twice the man I thought you were.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.738
Push, Amy.

38:43.947 --> 38:46.325
But only when she tells you to.

38:48.618 --> 38:49.619
Amy, come on!

38:54.541 --> 38:56.134
Well, my death arrives, I suppose.

38:56.209 --> 38:58.382
- But this one we're not invited to.
- Pardon?

38:58.461 --> 39:01.340
Nothing. Your molecular memory
can survive this, you know,

39:01.381 --> 39:03.804
it may not be the end.

39:05.134 --> 39:06.681
Well, if I turn up to nick
all your biscuits,

39:06.761 --> 39:07.887
then you'll know you were right,
won't you?

39:12.642 --> 39:15.065
Doctor! No, please...

39:17.814 --> 39:19.987
- You too, Cleaves, off you pop.
- I'm staying here.

39:20.191 --> 39:21.443
This is not the time for grand gestures.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.698
Says the king of grand gestures.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.029
This is my factory,
I'm not going anywhere.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.537
Foreman Miranda Cleaves! Marvellous.
Beware of imitations.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.868
Clear off out of here, the lot of you.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.552
- This will dissolve her.
- And us, too.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.724
- There may be a way back from this.
- From being vaporised? How?

39:44.799 --> 39:47.302
Don't know. Let's find out, eh?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.432
Geronimo.

40:03.610 --> 40:05.203
Uh, the energy from the Tardis

40:05.361 --> 40:08.456
will stabilise the Gangers for good.
They're people now.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.910
And what happens to me?

40:11.993 --> 40:14.121
Um...I still have this.

40:14.203 --> 40:16.422
Ah! That's not a problem,
I have something for that.

40:16.497 --> 40:20.877
It's small and red
and it tastes like burnt onions.

40:21.002 --> 40:24.097
Ha! But it'll get rid of
your blood clot.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.472
Happy endings.

40:38.269 --> 40:41.193
Hey! Hello, bud.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.445
- Hey!
- Daddy, you're back.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.824
Hello, my boy. How are you doing?

40:58.498 --> 41:00.125
You really want us to do this?

41:00.625 --> 41:03.720
Your company's telling telling the world
that the situation is over.

41:03.795 --> 41:07.720
You need to get in there and tell them
that the situation has only just begun.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.431
Make them understand what
they're doing to the Flesh.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.103
Make them stop.

41:12.261 --> 41:15.982
Dicken, remember, people are good,
in their bones, truly good.

41:16.057 --> 41:19.186
- Don't hate them, will you?
- How can I hate them?

41:19.686 --> 41:21.108
I'm one of them now.

41:21.187 --> 41:24.441
Yeah. And just remember, people died,
don't let that be in vain.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.743
Make what you say in that room count.

41:28.528 --> 41:29.529
Ready?

41:36.536 --> 41:38.083
Side by side.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.294
You got it, boss.

41:49.257 --> 41:50.509
You okay?

41:51.676 --> 41:53.019
I said breathe, Pond...

41:53.094 --> 41:54.391
Remember? Well, breathe.

41:55.096 --> 41:56.518
- Why?
- Breathe.

41:56.639 --> 41:57.731
- Oh!
- Good.

41:58.558 --> 41:59.684
Whoa! Whoa.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.310
What's wrong with her?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.692
Get her into the Tardis.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.959
Doctor, what is happening to her?

42:17.035 --> 42:18.628
Contractions.

42:18.661 --> 42:20.880
- Contractions?
- She's going into labour.

42:21.122 --> 42:24.877
Did he say...
No, no, of course he didn't.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.303
Rory, um, I don't like this.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.379
Ow!

42:28.421 --> 42:30.469
You're going to have to start explaining
some of this to me, Doctor!

42:30.548 --> 42:32.095
What, the birds and the bees?
She's having a baby.

42:32.175 --> 42:33.597
I needed to see the Flesh
in its early days,

42:33.676 --> 42:34.677
that's why I scanned it.

42:34.761 --> 42:35.808
That's why we were there
in the first place.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.730
I was going to drop you off
for fish and chips first

42:37.805 --> 42:41.480
but things happened,
and there was stuff and shenanigans.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.733
Beautiful word, shenanigans.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.814
- It hurts.
- You'll be okay.

42:46.898 --> 42:47.945
Breathe.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.576
I needed enough information
to block the signal to the Flesh.

42:51.194 --> 42:52.195
What signal?

42:52.820 --> 42:54.163
The signal to you.

42:55.364 --> 42:57.332
Doctor, Doctor...

42:58.826 --> 43:00.544
Stand away from her, Rory.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.631
Why? No! And why?

43:03.706 --> 43:05.629
Given what we've learned,
I'll be as humane as I can.

43:05.708 --> 43:08.928
But I need to do this
and you need to stand away!

43:25.394 --> 43:26.941
No...

43:34.070 --> 43:35.868
Doctor, I am frightened.

43:36.656 --> 43:38.579
I'm properly, properly scared.

43:38.658 --> 43:42.083
Don't be. Hold on.
We're coming for you, I swear.

43:42.161 --> 43:45.335
And whatever happens, however hard,
however far, we will find you.

43:45.414 --> 43:47.007
I'm right here.

43:48.084 --> 43:53.682
No, you're not. You haven't been here
for a long, long time.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.468
Oh, no.

44:08.229 --> 44:11.904
Well, dear,
you're ready to pop, aren't you?

44:12.233 --> 44:14.156
Little one's on its way.

44:22.118 --> 44:23.745
Here it comes!

44:25.079 --> 44:29.255
Push.
