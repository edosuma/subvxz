WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:02.960
Gunshot wounds
to the abdomen
and left chest.

00:03.128 --> 00:04.170
He's my brother.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.755
Previously on
Chicago Fire...

00:05.923 --> 00:08.800
If this was all about gangs,
there is one cop who could
have helped out.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.218
Don't even think about it.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.680
This conversation
becomes about favors.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.848
Sometimes you got
to dance with the devil.

00:16.016 --> 00:17.475
Voight tried
to take me out.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.103
You know,
Daniel's planning
on using the fact

00:20.270 --> 00:22.897
that I was on anti-depressants
as proof that
I'm mentally unstable.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.107
Well, screw Daniel.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.067
You have two weeks
to find a new place.

00:26.235 --> 00:27.819
What?

00:27.986 --> 00:30.029
Where am I going to live?
Where am I going to go?

00:30.197 --> 00:31.322
I got no right
to ask this, but...

00:31.490 --> 00:32.865
I think if you
reached out to her,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.451
it could go a long
way towards turning
things around.

00:35.619 --> 00:36.828
Renee?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.538
I'm doing fine.

00:39.164 --> 00:40.331
Thanks for your concern.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.833
I just got a call
from a hospital.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.084
She took
a bunch of pills.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.463
Cruz!
I'm coming in!

00:47.631 --> 00:49.215
Dammit, Cruz!

00:49.383 --> 00:51.843
Are you a fireman
or a kamikaze pilot now?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.302
Fire's out.
That's all that matters.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.722
It matters if you get
yourself killed.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.647
Thanks, Mom.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.065
Matt...
I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.859
We can talk then.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.905
Oh, oh, oh. Jeez.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.578
Mom, why are you
hiding from
your parole officer?

01:18.746 --> 01:20.496
I went out last night.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.748
If she tests me,
I won't pass.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.207
Just please
get rid of her.

01:29.298 --> 01:32.091
Ms. Kendrick.
Hi, Matt. I'm here
to check in on Nancy.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.886
Yeah, you just
missed her.
She's out for a walk.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.345
I can wait.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.141
Uh, my shift
is about to start.
I, uh...

01:41.393 --> 01:42.852
Fine.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.355
I'll try later.
Thank you.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.652
Leslie.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.946
Ms. Larocque,
so sorry.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.573
This is just how it is
when I'm on shift.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.784
My apologies.
Um, look,

01:58.410 --> 02:00.453
Daniel's rejected
her offer.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.330
He wants
full custody.

02:03.499 --> 02:04.957
I thought you said
he'd take the deal.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.585
It was a good deal,
but the father has
a strong case.

02:08.337 --> 02:12.423
Does he?
Let's look at it from
his lawyer's perspective.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.884
We've got
a switch hitter

02:15.052 --> 02:17.386
who married a man,
conceived a child
with him,

02:17.554 --> 02:18.930
then left him
and took the child

02:19.097 --> 02:21.641
to go live with her
former lesbian lover,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.559
a woman with a
time consuming

02:23.727 --> 02:25.603
and very
hazardous occupation.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.688
Oh, come on.
I'm just looking
for ways

02:27.856 --> 02:29.357
to normalize
this scenario

02:29.525 --> 02:31.192
as much
as possible.
Normalize?

02:31.360 --> 02:34.028
For instance,
you two shacking up with
a skirt-chasing firefighter

02:34.196 --> 02:35.530
is not helping
our cause.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.991
I was just trying
to tell her how Kelly
has been so helpful.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.577
Ladies, you want me
to convince a judge

02:41.745 --> 02:43.621
that you're serious
about being a family?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.541
Then you need to get
Clarice and this baby

02:46.708 --> 02:51.671
into a warm, loving,
nurturing, and yes,
normal home.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.178
Okay.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.181
We'll get our
own place.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.353
All companies be aware,

03:07.521 --> 03:09.689
we have lightweight
truss construction

03:09.857 --> 03:10.982
with heavy
structure fire.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.067
We can't get
down the stairs!
It's too hot!

03:13.235 --> 03:15.987
All companies,
third floor rescue.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.030
Casey, get me
two ladders.
Got it!

03:25.080 --> 03:27.081
Keep it flowing!
Herrmann, Mills, Cruz,

03:27.249 --> 03:28.791
up the second ladder!

03:34.381 --> 03:36.382
Come on.
Got you.

03:38.468 --> 03:39.635
Come on.
I got you man.
All right?

03:41.388 --> 03:42.430
You're doing
good, man.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.015
Have a seat, sweetheart.

03:44.182 --> 03:46.142
Good job, man.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.018
You okay?
Yeah.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.103
What about Hudson?
You have to get him.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.772
- The dog.
- Hudson! Hudson!

03:51.940 --> 03:55.151
Cruz! Stay put, Cruz.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.528
Wait a minute!
I can hear him!

03:57.696 --> 03:59.113
Come here, boy!

03:59.281 --> 04:01.407
Cruz! Get out of there!

04:02.701 --> 04:05.077
Cruz! Cruz!

04:07.247 --> 04:08.247
Cruz!

04:10.542 --> 04:11.667
Hudson!

04:13.211 --> 04:14.337
Hudson!

04:15.756 --> 04:17.465
Where are you, boy?

04:26.975 --> 04:28.351
Come here! Come on!

04:34.274 --> 04:35.650
Man down!
Man down!

04:35.817 --> 04:37.318
I'm going!

05:03.637 --> 05:05.262
Cruz! Call out!

05:06.765 --> 05:13.104
Cruz!

05:13.855 --> 05:16.232
Cruz, you okay buddy?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.943
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.321
All right.
We've gotta move.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.703
Watch out! Mouch!

05:29.287 --> 05:30.663
Whoa!

05:30.831 --> 05:32.999
Mouch!
Mouch!

05:34.793 --> 05:36.419
I'm okay!

05:37.170 --> 05:38.629
Mouch!

05:38.797 --> 05:41.132
This way! Follow me!

05:42.134 --> 05:43.134
Watch the flames!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.553
I got you!
Let's go.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.396
Mouch, you okay?
Yeah.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.148
You sure, man?
Let 'em check you out.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.191
Yeah, I'm fine!

05:59.359 --> 06:00.860
Hey Casey,
how about you?
You all right?

06:02.112 --> 06:03.612
Yeah.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.491
You've got
a second degree
burn here.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.119
Take him
to the hospital.
It's nothing, Chief.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.912
Take him to the hospital.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.878
You okay?
Good boy.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.390
This is out of control.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.404
Hey, Whaley.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.406
Any new updates
on Renee?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.075
She's okay,
physically.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.243
But they're going
to keep her in
a 72-hour hold.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.621
Psychiatric
observation.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.331
Did you talk to her?

06:56.625 --> 06:57.958
She wouldn't see me.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.088
I, uh, I don't know
what to do.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.513
Thank you.
Hey.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.098
Hey.

07:12.641 --> 07:14.100
How long are you
going to freeze
me out?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.185
I'm not freezing
you out.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.024
I got to talk
to Boden.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.777
Yeah, sure.
Cruz is still
in the E.R.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.239
He's telling the doctors
he wants to come back
and finish his shift.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.700
Did you happen to notice
if Cruz's bunker gear had
a cape sewn into it?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.536
No, Chief.

07:33.703 --> 07:34.870
It definitely does not.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.748
Then please dissuade
your man of the notion
that he is invincible.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.584
Sure.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.675
And that's how our fellow
firefighter was saved today.

07:47.843 --> 07:50.219
Fifty-six hits
in less than an hour.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.972
Just tell me this thing's
not going to go viral.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.015
Glad to see Mouch's
near-death experience

07:55.183 --> 07:57.017
can help drive traffic
to your podcast.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.312
The whole point of
the podcast is to show
people what we really do.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.899
You're supposed to be
looking up how-to videos
on taping drywall.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.651
All right.
We got to get
back to

08:05.819 --> 08:07.695
fixing up
the Bombardier,
all right?

08:07.863 --> 08:09.989
We're behind schedule.
Oh, stop calling it
the Bombardier.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.324
That name has
poisoned the well
with the locals.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.784
We've got to...

08:13.952 --> 08:15.327
Re-christen it
something else.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.329
May I propose

08:17.497 --> 08:18.998
Mustache Pete's?

08:19.166 --> 08:20.708
No, you may not.

08:20.876 --> 08:21.917
We need
something simple.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.879
A single,
evocative word,
like, uh...

08:25.046 --> 08:27.840
"Solstice," or
"Perception," or, um

08:28.008 --> 08:30.968
"Pretentious."
Or we could call it
something fun,

08:31.136 --> 08:31.886
like "Mustache Pete's."

08:32.053 --> 08:33.345
You can name the place
"Out Of Business"

08:33.513 --> 08:35.014
if we don't get
back on schedule.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.724
Okay, okay,
here we go.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.018
"How To
Tape Drywall.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.645
"Part One of...
Fifteen."

08:43.940 --> 08:47.234
Gee, you know
who I bet's really
good at drywall?

08:47.402 --> 08:48.485
Casey.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.863
Too bad somebody
got on his bad side

08:51.031 --> 08:53.991
by fraternizing with
one Detective Voight.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.954
Hey, uh, listen,
I need to...
Hey!

08:59.122 --> 09:02.082
Have I thanked you
lately for opening
your trap about Renee?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.001
Because she's currently
in a psych ward.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.087
Kelly, she needs help.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.048
How fun do you think
this is for her?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.928
Yeah. What,
what'd you want
to talk about?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.599
Ambulance 61, person down.
Later.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.351
Michigan
and Upper Wacker.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.151
Hey, Christie.

09:30.111 --> 09:33.113
I have a new proposal
regarding Mom.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.949
Give me a call
when you can. Bye.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.410
Hey, Mouch.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.079
You okay?

09:40.580 --> 09:43.832
I came to you
a while back
about Cruz.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.253
How there's
something off
about him.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.130
And you told
me to shut up.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.967
In so many words,
I guess.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.221
So, are you still
in charge of our truck,

09:58.223 --> 10:01.225
or do I have to
go around you
and talk to Boden?

10:11.486 --> 10:13.362
Watching you and Kelly
move back in and out
of that place

10:13.530 --> 10:15.155
is like watching
a ping-pong match.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.032
I know. I get it.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.242
I just hope
he understands.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.246
I tried to get him
to come inside a store,
but he won't move.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.249
Hey, it's too cold
for you to be
out here, hon.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.959
What's your name?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.003
Mick.
Mick, can you stand up?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.088
You think you can
walk over to that
ambulance?

10:31.256 --> 10:34.174
Come on, Mick.
Oh, yeah.
We got you.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.305
Whoa!
Seventy over fifty.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.473
What are you on?
Mmm.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.600
Okay, fine.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.936
But it looks like
you might be suffering
from exposure,

10:46.104 --> 10:47.771
so we're going to
get you to the hospital.
All right?

10:47.939 --> 10:49.898
Nah.
Yeah.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.900
It's nice and warm at the
hospital, Mick.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.028
You'll like it.
Lots of pretty nurses.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.988
Prettier than you two?

10:56.156 --> 10:57.740
C'mon, be realistic.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.908
Hey, don't worry
about Severide.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.994
He'll totally understand
why you need
to move out.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.954
I know,
but just...

11:04.122 --> 11:07.041
After all the drama,
it just sucks.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.461
Having a lawyer
make decisions
about your living situation.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.087
Okay, Mick,
just a little pinch.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.756
Ahhh!

11:34.486 --> 11:37.071
We'll keep trying
to convince him to
consent to a blood draw,

11:37.238 --> 11:38.947
but we can't
force him to.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.741
And unless he does,

11:40.909 --> 11:43.702
we can only guess
at what transmittable
diseases he's carrying.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.579
And judging from
this cocktail
of anti-virals

11:45.747 --> 11:47.873
you must think this guy
is a walking petri-dish.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.000
Hep B is always
a big risk,

11:50.168 --> 11:51.251
also Hep C.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.380
The interferon therapy
should protect you
against those.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.174
But, given the tracks
on his arms and symptoms,

11:57.884 --> 11:58.884
I think we need
to treat you as though

11:59.052 --> 12:00.511
you've been
exposed to H.I.V.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.940
How soon can
we test for H.I.V?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.026
Not for three months
after exposure.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.195
Here's the first one.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.992
Hey, you're
going to be fine.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.744
The statistics are way
in your favor.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.247
I mean, it's like
Russian Roulette.
Large bore needle,

12:28.415 --> 12:30.207
filled with this
guy's blood.
If he has the hiccups,

12:30.375 --> 12:31.625
I'm going
to catch them.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.093
Hey, uh, Lieutenant.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.803
I was hoping to ask
you a question.

12:42.971 --> 12:46.140
Um, I was looking
at the list of upcoming
classes at the academy,

12:46.307 --> 12:48.392
and I'm trying
to figure out
which ones to take to,

12:48.560 --> 12:51.019
if possible,
make the move
to Squad.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.898
Let me eat
my Corn Flakes first.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.234
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.322
We can finish
the exposure
paperwork later.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.117
Don't worry, Shay.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.161
You're getting
the best care available.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.455
Thanks, Chief.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.626
What's wrong with her?

13:14.794 --> 13:15.836
Needle stick.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.422
Oh! Was he sick?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.049
Yellow, track marks.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.093
And he didn't agree
to a blood panel.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.102
You okay?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.189
I just want
this shift to end.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.942
Casey hates me.
Now my partner
gets stuck.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.195
Casey?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.322
Yeah, forget it.
It's fine.

13:44.491 --> 13:45.824
Screw him.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.285
He doesn't
understand you,
it's his problem.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.830
Yeah. Yeah,
thanks Mills.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.758
Even if it's
just Hep C, it's...

14:03.343 --> 14:06.136
You know,
80%o of infections
are chronic,

14:06.304 --> 14:08.847
and um, I'd be
on disability for months.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.516
And if Daniel's
lawyer finds out...

14:10.683 --> 14:12.476
You're getting ahead
of yourself.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.021
Wait for the tests
to come back.

14:16.648 --> 14:18.357
Yeah.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.319
Um...

14:23.446 --> 14:26.782
The lawyer said that
living with you isn't
normal enough,

14:28.785 --> 14:31.328
So I have to move out.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.497
I'm sorry.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.629
You do whatever it takes
to keep you, Clarice
and that baby together.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.757
Yeah.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.843
Thanks.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.146
Hey, Mouch.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.232
How's the arm?

15:00.858 --> 15:02.568
Burned, but fine.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.196
Hey, man, I wanted
to thank you again.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.365
It's in the job
description, right?

15:10.285 --> 15:11.577
Yeah.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.380
Hey, also,
I think I owe you
an apology.

15:37.395 --> 15:40.522
I realize you may
not understand
why I went to Voight.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.942
I didn't have
another choice

15:44.110 --> 15:46.612
and it made
all the difference
in Antonio's case.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.573
He threatened me
and my fiancee.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.908
He saved
my brother, Casey.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.455
Cruz is back in case
you're interested.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.301
I screwed up,
Lieutenant.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.761
It won't happen again.
Believe me.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.471
I tried that
once already.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.307
When you told me
you could live with
your sins.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.601
That turned out
to be a lie.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.729
Lieutenant,
you got to believe...
This is not a conversation!

16:22.690 --> 16:24.816
If you've come
to hate yourself,

16:25.318 --> 16:27.569
if you've decided
that you don't
deserve to live,

16:27.737 --> 16:29.363
that's your problem.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.740
Do you want to stand
at the ceremony

16:31.908 --> 16:34.368
where we pin
Mouch's badge
next to Darden's

16:34.535 --> 16:36.244
because he burned
to death trying to
save someone

16:36.412 --> 16:37.746
who's already dead inside?

16:40.416 --> 16:43.126
If your badge isn't
on Boden's desk
by next shift,

16:44.379 --> 16:46.254
I'll go to the police
about Flaco.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.007
It'll mean the end
of my career, too,
but hey,

16:49.175 --> 16:51.009
I'll pound nails
for a living.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.345
What I can't do
is stand by

16:53.513 --> 16:56.306
and watch you endanger
one more of my men.

17:10.405 --> 17:11.822
The kitchen's
just been redone.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.074
New cabinets,
new appliances.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.743
Laundry hookups
are right over there.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.745
Great.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.914
Um,

17:21.666 --> 17:24.710
school-wise, I know
Wesley's young, but...

17:24.877 --> 17:26.670
Oh, it's never too early
to think about that.

17:26.838 --> 17:30.006
We're in the very desirable
Bell Elementary
School District.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.550
But, I have to be
honest with you.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.927
I've got a lot of people
interested in this unit.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.847
Okay, can you
just give us,
like, a second?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.473
Sure.
Thank you.

17:42.145 --> 17:43.979
Uh, okay, thank you.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.898
So, the, uh,
the lawyer says

17:47.066 --> 17:49.776
that Daniel's attorneys
could find out about
the needle stick

17:49.944 --> 17:51.778
during discovery.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.114
Look, Daniel's lawyer
can say whatever he wants.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.867
What that judge
is going to see
is a family,

17:57.034 --> 17:59.911
ready to provide
Wesley with a warm
and loving home

18:02.874 --> 18:06.501
in a very desirable
school district.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.879
You're right.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.589
I'm sorry.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.842
We'll take it!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.563
What, you expected
a strait jacket?

18:27.690 --> 18:29.316
Why are you here,
exactly?

18:30.401 --> 18:31.860
Because your brother
asked me to come.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.987
Poor Eric.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.823
He thinks he's
finally cracked
the puzzle that is Renee.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.828
All this nonsense
about me sleeping
with Dean.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.413
I'm not here
to argue about that.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.332
Oh, right, because
as my life turned to ashes

18:45.500 --> 18:47.834
you just coasted on
and forgot all about me.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.628
You don't know anything
about my life.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.758
I know that Kelly
Severide is doing
just fine.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.763
We're done.
Take me back.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.848
Open the door.
Renee

19:09.148 --> 19:12.150
Dawson, you have
absolutely no idea
what you're doing, huh?

19:12.944 --> 19:14.110
What are you
talking about?

19:16.864 --> 19:18.073
Call Casey.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.621
What the hell?

19:33.756 --> 19:34.965
Whoa.

19:35.132 --> 19:37.843
Stephanides didn't
say anything about a safe.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.512
What do you
think's inside?
Nothing good.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.889
My luck don't run
that way.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.267
Well, let's open it
and find out!

19:45.434 --> 19:47.060
Worse-case scenario,
it's empty.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.563
What if it contains
a decomposed head

19:49.730 --> 19:51.940
of some gangster
that went missing
in the twenties?

19:52.108 --> 19:55.610
Next thing you know,
this bar gets wrapped
in crime scene tape

19:55.778 --> 19:57.779
and we can't
get back in here.

19:57.947 --> 20:00.031
If there's a mobster's
head in there,

20:00.199 --> 20:01.825
Mustache Pete's
is going to be famous.

20:01.993 --> 20:04.244
We're not calling it
Mustache Pete's.
Yes we are.

20:06.038 --> 20:06.830
Forget it.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.999
That safe is bad news.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.459
- Look out.
- Hey, Herrmann!

20:11.627 --> 20:13.920
Each week, my shift
moves up a day.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.714
Tuesday and Friday
this week,

20:15.882 --> 20:16.965
Monday and Thursday
next week.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.633
I've drawn up a list
of house rules

20:18.801 --> 20:20.093
that Mom would
have to agree to.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.346
Uh, curfews, when
she can have visitors,

20:23.514 --> 20:24.931
you can add whatever
you want to the list.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.975
Matt, no.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.019
Christie, I need you.

20:29.186 --> 20:29.978
Please.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.105
At least on the days
that I'm on shift.

20:33.149 --> 20:36.067
Will I have to learn
how to lie to her
parole officer, too?

20:41.198 --> 20:42.198
Mom.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.162
Christie.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.000
You look wonderful.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.588
Mom...

20:57.548 --> 21:00.300
Well, do you realize
this is the first time

21:00.468 --> 21:04.304
we've all been together
as a family in 15 years?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.309
Yeah.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.691
I guess the real purpose
of this meeting

21:16.859 --> 21:20.236
is to discuss
the Mom problem.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.827
Okay, fine.
I'll talk to Jim.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.373
Okay. Now let's eat.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.125
The chicken sandwich
is great, by the way.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.962
I'm a vegan.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.506
Since when?

21:39.674 --> 21:41.299
Going on 10 years, Matt.

21:42.093 --> 21:43.677
I did not know that.
I...

21:44.261 --> 21:46.054
Wow. Is that like
a vegetarian?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.014
Or is it
the eggs thing
you can't eat...

21:48.182 --> 21:49.766
- Oh my gosh.
- What?

21:49.934 --> 21:52.018
Do I seriously have to
explain this to you?

21:56.023 --> 21:58.024
Hey, did you get
my message?
Yeah.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.359
What'd she say?

22:00.277 --> 22:02.070
Nothing that matters.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.822
She's angry.
At me?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.740
At me.
At, at everything.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.285
Look,
I'm sorry, but...

22:09.453 --> 22:11.329
All this
was against my
better judgment

22:11.497 --> 22:14.165
and now she's
spinning out. So...
No, I get it. I get it.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.126
Thanks, Kelly.

22:18.421 --> 22:21.798
This is, uh,
it's my last shift at 51.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.761
I'm glad we got
the chance to
work together.

22:38.149 --> 22:41.317
Is Cruz going to grace us
with his presence today?

22:42.945 --> 22:44.195
I don't know.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.240
Did you talk to him?
I did.

22:47.408 --> 22:50.535
How'd that talk go?
Don't worry
about it, Mouch.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.203
I talked to him.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.289
That's all you
need to know.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.170
You brood of vipers!

23:00.337 --> 23:03.798
Who warned you
to flee from
the coming wrath?

23:04.925 --> 23:07.302
Produce good fruit

23:07.470 --> 23:09.763
as evidence of
your repentance.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.767
Even now the ax lies

23:13.934 --> 23:15.477
at the root
of the trees.

23:16.020 --> 23:19.314
Therefore every tree
which does not
bear good fruit

23:19.482 --> 23:21.399
will be cut down

23:21.859 --> 23:24.194
and thrown
into the fire.

23:25.654 --> 23:29.115
I am baptizing you
with water,
for repentance,

23:30.117 --> 23:33.036
but the one who is
coming after me
is mightier than I.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.790
I am not worthy
to carry his sandals.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.793
He will baptize you

23:39.960 --> 23:43.338
with the Holy Spirit
and fire.

23:44.590 --> 23:48.301
And do not presume
to say to yourselves,

23:48.469 --> 23:50.804
we have Abraham
as our father.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.139
Look, Mom! A fireman!

23:53.307 --> 23:57.268
To raise up
children to Abraham
with these stones.

23:58.354 --> 24:01.564
Then Jesus came
from Galilee
to John at the Jordan

24:01.732 --> 24:03.608
to be baptized
by him.

24:04.568 --> 24:09.030
John tried to prevent it,
saying I need to be
baptized by you.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.594
I read the whole thing,
front to back.

24:31.762 --> 24:34.681
There's no codicil
in this deed
about any safe.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.933
We bought the bar lock,
stock and barrel.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.018
That means the safe
rightly belongs to you,
me and Otis.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.813
Along with whatever's
inside, whether it's
an old stamp collection

24:41.981 --> 24:45.233
or bearer bonds
or gold doubloons!

24:45.818 --> 24:47.569
You're outvoted,
Herrmann.
Two to one.

24:47.736 --> 24:50.822
We didn't buy
that bar hoping
to find buried treasure.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.032
We bought it as
an honest investment.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.369
And for the first time
in my life, I feel like

24:56.537 --> 24:58.955
I'm onto something
good and real.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.499
Now, whatever
is in that safe,

25:01.667 --> 25:05.420
somebody put it in there
and locked it away
for a reason.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.089
Why don't we
leave it alone

25:08.591 --> 25:10.842
and get on
with our plan?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.013
Yeah, we're going
to open the safe.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.307
Seconded.

25:17.474 --> 25:19.726
Truck 81, Ambulance 61,

25:19.894 --> 25:23.062
Battalion 25.
Bomb squad assist,
Wrightwood and Kedzie.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.940
C.P.D. Be advised
to divert all traffic.

25:26.108 --> 25:28.359
Bomb disposal unit
on site at Lincoln Square.

25:33.908 --> 25:38.036
So, what exactly
is our role in
a bomb squad assist?

25:39.705 --> 25:40.955
Nothing.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.208
Not unless the
bomb tech snips
a wrong wire.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.293
What's the story, Chief?

25:45.461 --> 25:47.712
A tenant committed
suicide in his car
around back,

25:47.880 --> 25:49.297
shot himself in the head.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.841
But the police are suspect
because the deceased
was turned down

25:52.009 --> 25:56.221
four times by the C.P.D.
And there is a gasoline smell
coming from inside.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.268
Zoom in.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.400
Our mast camera
confirmed the place
is wired.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.445
We should cut our way in.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.030
We have access
to the apartment above?

26:34.927 --> 26:37.136
That'll do it.
Great. We'll get
out of your way.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.933
Whoa...

26:43.269 --> 26:45.019
There's a woman
down there.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.861
The neighbors say
it's his ex-wife.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.863
My guy will go in
and see if
it's secure,

26:56.031 --> 26:57.782
and your guys
can bring her out.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.911
Severide,

27:02.079 --> 27:03.329
you sure
you want
to do this?

27:07.001 --> 27:08.209
We're here, right?

27:08.377 --> 27:09.836
Going to need
a jump bag, though.

27:10.004 --> 27:11.671
Copy that.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.684
All right. Okay.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.146
Carpet's wet.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.064
Gasoline.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.446
She's been stabbed.

27:36.613 --> 27:37.739
Come on down.

27:52.796 --> 27:53.713
Dawson, Shay.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.757
She's got a steak knife
stuck in her abdomen.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.592
- Pulse?
- Weak.

27:57.760 --> 27:59.844
Hey! Can you get us
out that door?

28:00.346 --> 28:02.305
There's quick
and there's safe.
Which do you want?

28:02.473 --> 28:04.098
I want to save
this woman's life.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.227
Huh.
"Huh?" What, "Huh"?

28:08.729 --> 28:11.064
A small,
incendiary device,

28:11.231 --> 28:13.316
set to spark
the gasoline.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.276
This will take
a few minutes
to disarm.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.694
She doesn't have
a few minutes.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.905
I got two more wires
splitting here.

28:21.492 --> 28:23.242
It's wired here, too.

28:23.827 --> 28:24.786
Headed...

28:36.799 --> 28:37.840
Here we go.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.803
I've got at least
five pounds of mixed
ammonium nitrate.

28:42.805 --> 28:45.348
That plus the gasoline
is a fertilizer bomb.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.687
Hey, Chief,
is everyone back?

28:51.855 --> 28:53.314
You just get yourself
down here, Kelly.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.152
How's she doing,
Severide?

28:58.779 --> 29:00.988
Weaker.
How much blood
is on the floor?

29:01.156 --> 29:02.865
Uh, it's not that much.

29:04.785 --> 29:06.536
Then she's
bleeding internally.
You got to move.

29:06.954 --> 29:08.830
Pack that knife so
it doesn't shift
when you move her.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.332
Where the hell's
that jump bag?

29:12.751 --> 29:13.835
Whaley's here.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.254
Use all the gauze
and tape he's got to
keep it secure.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.050
Someone's always
got it worse.

29:21.552 --> 29:22.718
Ain't that right.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.263
We're packing
around the knife.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.098
Hey, we need
that door open now.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.518
Attempting to disarm
the door.

29:32.896 --> 29:34.564
Kelly.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.023
Kelly!

29:46.952 --> 29:48.995
We're good.
Door's open.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.247
Woman's coming out.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.808
Who says Engine
only knows how
to put out a fire?

30:47.221 --> 30:48.846
Okay.

30:51.892 --> 30:53.017
I'll talk to Boden.

31:25.968 --> 31:28.636
What happened, Joe?

31:38.063 --> 31:39.355
I kicked in that door,

31:40.983 --> 31:42.942
convinced Leon
was in there.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.195
I even knew
I was too late.

31:48.282 --> 31:49.824
But it wasn't Leon.

31:50.492 --> 31:51.826
It was Flaco.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.203
Dead.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.706
It was Flaco
and you were
too late.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.499
All I could think
was if I pull him
out of those flames,

31:58.667 --> 32:00.001
I might as well
throw Leon back in.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.920
You don't know that.
I thought that God
was just handing

32:03.088 --> 32:05.089
me the answer
to my problems.

32:08.135 --> 32:09.594
But now I know
it was the Devil.

32:12.014 --> 32:13.806
I thought I could
run from him,

32:13.974 --> 32:16.601
nonstop, first one in,
last one out,

32:19.605 --> 32:21.480
and then
I almost killed you.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.317
I could've
killed Otis

32:24.484 --> 32:26.652
or Herrmann
or Casey.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.446
All because
I'm weak.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.163
Well, now I know.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.374
I'm the one that
has to suffer,

32:41.084 --> 32:42.251
not you.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.131
Joe...

32:47.299 --> 32:48.633
I forgive you.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.552
It's not right for me

32:51.720 --> 32:53.638
to bring my sins
into this house

32:54.598 --> 32:56.932
and have my brothers
sacrifice for what I did.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.101
Joe. Listen to me.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.689
I forgive you.

33:22.084 --> 33:23.459
What can I do
for you, Casey?

33:24.336 --> 33:26.045
Lieutenant!

33:26.213 --> 33:27.088
Can I have
a minute?

33:27.255 --> 33:29.715
Now's not
a good time, Mouch.
Yes it is.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.057
You don't have
to do this to him.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.267
There's more to it
than you know, Mouch.

33:41.061 --> 33:42.228
He told me
everything.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.232
Now, I don't know
if he was waiting
for God,

33:46.400 --> 33:50.444
or Flaco's ghost,
or just somebody
to say it,

33:51.488 --> 33:53.906
but he needed to know
what he did was okay.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.828
He screwed up.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.454
He knows it.

34:00.622 --> 34:03.165
But he was taking
care of his family.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.129
How far would you go
for the ones you love?

34:08.880 --> 34:10.589
How far
have you gone?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.112
Hello?

35:15.280 --> 35:16.822
Yes, this is
Leslie Shay.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.618
He consented to
a blood draw.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.369
That's good.
Isn't it?

35:23.246 --> 35:25.456
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

35:25.874 --> 35:27.291
Okay, thank you.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.919
He's clean.
He tested negative
for everything.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.004
God...

35:41.556 --> 35:43.766
Good luck, Renee.
Yeah, thanks.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.233
For real?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.735
Come get in the car.
Something we need to see.

35:54.903 --> 35:56.445
Go to hell.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.490
You're full of it,
you know that?

35:59.658 --> 36:01.200
Oh I am, huh?

36:01.368 --> 36:03.118
Is that going to
get me into your car?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.287
Ignore everything
that's real.
Go ahead.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.247
Whatever.

36:08.416 --> 36:10.334
Your brother
was a hero today.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.629
That is so low.

36:14.965 --> 36:15.881
You stopped,
didn't you?

36:17.050 --> 36:18.509
Thirty minutes,

36:18.677 --> 36:20.344
then I take you
anywhere you want to go.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.773
It's just a box.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.199
We never should
have opened this.

36:46.580 --> 36:49.331
Mom's just getting
her things.
Okay.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.749
Thanks for agreeing
to this, Christie.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.084
I really think
it'll work.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.545
Yeah, well tomorrow
morning at 8:01,

36:54.713 --> 36:56.547
she's all yours again.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.173
Understood.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.219
- Friend of yours?
- Nope.

37:04.598 --> 37:05.973
That's Cheyenne.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.143
Your old cell mate?
Yeah.

37:10.103 --> 37:12.187
You two
gave me back
my freedom.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.690
But I don't want
to be your problem anymore.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.943
So, I'm going to go
stay with Cheyenne

37:18.111 --> 37:20.321
until I figure out
what's next.

37:20.488 --> 37:21.822
Mom, I don't think
your P.O. Is going...

37:21.990 --> 37:24.074
Oh, don't worry.
I'll sort things out
with Kendrick.

37:25.118 --> 37:25.868
But I'm not going
to be the wedge

37:26.036 --> 37:27.995
that drives you two
apart anymore.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.001
Oh...

37:35.128 --> 37:37.838
Be a brother
and sister again, okay?

37:38.006 --> 37:40.174
You know, be there
for each other.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.968
Hey,
how's it going?
Good.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.563
Are we going to
sign a lease or not?

37:54.731 --> 37:55.773
Yes, we are.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.525
We definitely are.
I'm sorry, I can't
get a hold of her.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.277
Um...

38:00.445 --> 38:02.154
Oh. Hey!
Hey...

38:02.322 --> 38:03.822
Did you get
my message?

38:03.990 --> 38:05.532
Yeah, that's, uh...

38:06.117 --> 38:07.076
Great news.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.620
We should sign the lease.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.790
Uh, actually, would you
mind giving us a second?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.422
So, um,

38:21.675 --> 38:23.258
Daniel offered
to settle.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.095
Yeah. Split custody,

38:26.554 --> 38:28.764
I mean, if I move
to New York
with the baby.

38:30.558 --> 38:32.726
Good! That's great!

38:33.228 --> 38:35.562
He blinked!
I took the deal.

38:37.607 --> 38:40.859
What?
I just, I can't keep
fighting him anymore, Les.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.697
So I'm going to go
to, uh, I'm going
to go to New York.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.824
No. Clarice,
just stand up to him.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.243
We can win this.
I'm leaving tonight.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.873
Shay...

39:05.677 --> 39:07.428
Okay, I get it.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.680
Come on.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.374
It's quieter
than I remember.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.043
Please, don't.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.340
You're the one
who said, "Life
never looked simpler

39:45.508 --> 39:47.134
"than it did
from right here."

39:48.011 --> 39:50.387
Well, that was crap.
Sometimes a view
is just a view.

39:56.644 --> 39:59.980
You know? I never had
anything close to a real
relationship since you.

40:03.985 --> 40:05.402
Really?

40:07.739 --> 40:10.282
One girl I liked,
really liked,

40:11.284 --> 40:12.659
but she left.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.119
Or I let her leave.

40:15.789 --> 40:17.247
I should've made
it work, but sometimes

40:17.415 --> 40:19.625
it's easier just to
let things fall apart.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.138
I slept with Dean.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.602
And now I see you,

40:40.396 --> 40:44.983
and I see my family,
and all I can see
is what I lost.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.363
Sometimes a view
is just a view.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.084
I've missed you.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.129
I figured you hated me.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.713
Oh, I did...

41:09.592 --> 41:11.260
But not anymore.
