What up, my lovely females! This is
your boy, Costa, your host for the evening.

00:33.133 --> 00:37.194
Behind me is Thomas Kub's house.
Today is Thomas Kub's birthday.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.567
And this is Project X, yo.

00:48.581 --> 00:51.448
<i>Hey, we want some pussy</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:59.282
<i>Hey, we want some pussy</i>

00:59.459 --> 01:02.189
Birthday cake. Mm.

01:03.129 --> 01:05.893
- Dax, my dick is gonna get so wet tonight.
- Excuse me.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.967
Shit. Um, Mrs. Kub,
I thought you guys left already.

01:09.135 --> 01:13.128
- So, what's getting wet tonight?
- Uh...

01:13.306 --> 01:15.900
Nothing. I'm sorry about that, Mrs. Kub.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.806
- Who's your friend?
- Don't worry about him.

01:18.978 --> 01:21.071
We're shooting this birthday movie
for Thomas.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.579
Like this day-in-the-life type thing.
No big deal.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.877
He's still in the shower.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.219
See you later.

01:32.058 --> 01:34.288
Fuck me, that was close.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.257
Dax.

01:48.374 --> 01:49.841
Happy birthday, motherfucker!

01:50.009 --> 01:52.170
Whoa, shit! What the fuck, dude?

01:53.279 --> 01:55.509
- What the fuck?
- I'm jerking off to your mom.

01:55.682 --> 01:59.277
So, dude, it's your last day
of being a loser. How does it feel?

01:59.452 --> 02:01.750
You're such a dick, Costa.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.650
Shit never gets old.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.492
<i>Wait for another day</i>

02:07.660 --> 02:10.253
What's up, Dax?
How'd they rope you into this?

02:10.430 --> 02:12.295
He's one of J.B.'s guys from Gay-V Club.

02:12.465 --> 02:15.025
He's a fucking weirdo, I know,
but he's a solid shooter.

02:15.201 --> 02:17.829
And he's gonna make us look pimp,
and you fucking better.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.267
Thomas, get down here!

02:20.440 --> 02:22.271
Oh, shit. Let's go.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.578
You said your parents would be gone by 7.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.611
I don't wanna go talk to your fucking dad.

02:33.186 --> 02:36.849
No food in the living room. Your mother
will kill me and I'll have to kill you.

02:37.023 --> 02:39.116
- Here's 40 bucks for pizza, okay?
- Oh, cool.

02:39.292 --> 02:42.159
You guys can have that.
Knock yourself out.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.262
Back door or turn the alarm system off.

02:44.430 --> 02:47.922
And look, Thomas, I'm not an idiot.
I know you're gonna have friends over.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.968
- Dad, what do you think is gonna happen?
- Mr. Kub, honestly, we have no...

02:51.137 --> 02:53.332
Mm-mm. I'm sorry. Who are you?

02:53.506 --> 02:54.803
This is Dax.
What is this?

02:54.974 --> 02:58.034
He's shooting a movie
for my birthday, you know, a little present.

02:58.211 --> 03:01.271
Didn't know you had Goth friends.
He's just a friend from school.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.846
Four or five friends, tops.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.814
I'm just asking that you please
respect my house, okay?

03:05.985 --> 03:07.452
All right, fine.

03:07.887 --> 03:09.855
So leave the gate open for the gardener.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.083
And I know I don't need to tell you,
but my car is off limits.

03:13.259 --> 03:15.284
- Yeah, Dad, I know.
- Good. Okay.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.759
The pool heater, don't touch it.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.661
And also, guys,
do not go in my office, right?

03:20.833 --> 03:24.599
I have three projects I'm working on.
I don't want anybody in there, clear?

03:24.771 --> 03:27.103
- Get out, out, out.
- Dad...

03:27.774 --> 03:30.004
Nothing goes in here, right?

03:30.310 --> 03:33.837
Where's your mom?
I'm gonna get the bags.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.610
What's going on? What's the matter?

03:37.784 --> 03:39.479
- I'm just worried.
- About what?

03:39.652 --> 03:42.177
I don't know.
Thomas, leaving him alone all weekend.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.916
Oh, please, stop it. Come on, honey.
He's 17 years old.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.491
That's what I'm worried about.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.754
Let's be realistic here, okay?

03:50.930 --> 03:54.161
This is Thomas we're talking about.
He's not exactly Mr. Popular.

03:54.334 --> 03:58.065
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying that he's not that type of kid.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.299
He's got a couple of friends. They're gonna
hang out, but they're not gonna do anything.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.705
He's a sweet kid, but...

04:05.812 --> 04:07.803
...he's a loser.

04:10.316 --> 04:12.784
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

04:14.354 --> 04:16.322
- Happy birthday, Thomas.
- Whoo! Yay!

04:16.488 --> 04:17.820
All right, honey, car is here.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.583
- Boys, gotta get to school.
- Cool.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.250
Hold on. We gotta give Thomas
his birthday present.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.192
How cool is it that Thomas
was born on your anniversary?

04:25.365 --> 04:27.731
What a great anniversary gift, a baby.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.993
Happy birthday, sweetie.
Ahh.

04:30.169 --> 04:32.137
- Mom's minivan? Nice.
- Yeah.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.500
It's just for school and back.
That's it, right?

04:34.674 --> 04:37.336
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Cool, right? You have a car now.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.102
I know.
- Okay.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.908
And, Milo, you take good care of Thomas,
okay? Momma's gonna miss you.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.277
- Okay, bye.
- All right, see you guys.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.715
Every one of my phone calls
gets answered, right?

04:47.887 --> 04:49.650
- Yeah, I know.
- Every one. Okay.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.380
- All right, have fun.
- Bye.

04:51.557 --> 04:53.821
Happy anniversary.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.519
Get off me, you little faggot dog.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.186
- Yeah!
- It's on, motherfuckers!

04:58.398 --> 05:01.834
- Whoo!
- Dude, chill out. Goddamn.

05:02.535 --> 05:06.096
It was really cool of your mom and dad
to clean it out and wash it for you.

05:06.272 --> 05:09.036
It's a free car.
I'm not about to complain about a free car.

05:09.208 --> 05:12.803
It's not even a car. It's a fucking minivan.
We can't even roll in this.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.278
Dude, too bad your dad didn't give you
the Benz. That'd have been sick.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.782
You know what, you're right, Costa.
Let's just take your car.

05:19.952 --> 05:23.388
- Oh, you don't have one.
- Good fucking joke, good fucking joke.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.957
So, dog, you ready for tonight?

05:26.125 --> 05:30.186
I actually wanna talk to you
about that, you know, before we jump into it.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.797
I knew it. You're bitching out.
What?

05:34.033 --> 05:35.557
What? Dude, I'm not bitching out.

05:35.735 --> 05:38.295
Thomas is bitching out
like the little bitch that he is.

05:38.471 --> 05:41.599
- Fuck you.
- Oh, my God.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.338
- Oh, shit.
- We need this party. You need this party.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.481
I'm just nervous.
What if nobody shows up? What if it sucks?

05:49.649 --> 05:52.948
That's not an option.
People will show up.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.553
Look at J.B. He's like a little fat
Rain Man, texting away.

05:56.923 --> 05:59.949
Dude, stop.
You're telling me he doesn't need this?

06:05.298 --> 06:08.358
Holy shit, dude. Your parents gave
you the minivan? That's awesome!

06:08.534 --> 06:11.094
- Yeah.
- Hey, Costa. Hey, Dax.

06:12.472 --> 06:15.737
That isn't happening. That's not real.

06:15.908 --> 06:18.001
Uh, excuse me...
Sorry.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.441
Hey, can I get to my locker right there?

06:20.613 --> 06:22.706
Dude, why are you staring at my dick?

06:24.250 --> 06:26.343
I wasn't. My locker's there.
Can I get to it?

06:26.519 --> 06:30.956
- Whatever, you fucking weirdo.
- Dude, just let it go. Just come on.

06:33.326 --> 06:37.023
- Hey, that's a sweet minivan, soccer mom.
- See? See what I told you?

06:38.598 --> 06:40.862
Is it true what I heard about you
at Zam's party?

06:41.033 --> 06:42.500
You got a blowjob from his mom?

06:42.668 --> 06:45.296
That party was so sick.
Everyone got laid.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.336
Wheelchair Robert even got a handjob.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.168
- Nice.
- Are you kidding me?

06:49.342 --> 06:51.674
Why the fuck weren't we
at that party, man?

06:51.844 --> 06:53.607
So we missed a party, dude. Big deal.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.078
It is a big deal. We miss every party.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.616
I mean, did you hear that guy?
Wheelchair Robert got beat off.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.153
I wanna show you something.
See this? Check this out.

07:03.322 --> 07:06.189
That's Stasia. Gorgeous, right?
That's my girl back in Queens.

07:06.359 --> 07:09.487
We could be crushing this kind of ass,
but we need a game changer.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.721
I mean, no one even knows who we are.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.958
If we want to be bigtime players,
we need to make a bigtime play.

07:15.468 --> 07:16.696
You feel me?

07:16.869 --> 07:19.337
J.B., what the fuck, man?
Why do you have a boner?

07:19.505 --> 07:22.167
- I don't, it's just my underwear sitting funny.
- Cover up.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.002
That's absolutely disgusting.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.078
It's easy to talk shit when
the party's not even at your house.

07:27.246 --> 07:32.309
Dude, please don't back out.
This party is gonna change everything for us.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.454
Okay. Well, I mean,
I'm the one taking the whole risk.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.384
All you do is show up and drink.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.821
You think we'd ditch you
if something went wrong?

07:39.992 --> 07:41.983
- I'm fucking offended, man.
- Yeah, me too.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.425
The idea behind tonight is
to get these bitches...

07:44.597 --> 07:46.565
...to recognize us as large-scale ballers.

07:46.732 --> 07:49.895
Back in Queens,
I had hoes blowing me on the reg.

07:50.069 --> 07:54.062
- I started hanging out with you two. Zero!
- I just don't really see the point anymore.

07:54.240 --> 07:57.641
How do you not see the point?
There's the point. There's the point.

07:57.810 --> 07:58.834
Okay.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.138
There's two more fucking points
right there! It's all around you.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.338
Dude, I get it.

08:02.782 --> 08:06.309
If you fuck this up, I will stab you.
I'm not kidding.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.716
- Okay, no more than 20 people.
- Twenty people?

08:08.888 --> 08:10.719
- All right, 30 people.
- Thirty people?

08:10.890 --> 08:15.224
- To make sure my house doesn't get fucked.
- Thirty people won't change anything for us.

08:15.394 --> 08:18.124
All right, look, okay, 50 people,
absolute max.

08:18.297 --> 08:21.562
Fine, 50 people, absolute max.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.929
You know, just big enough to be cool.

08:24.837 --> 08:29.536
<i>Sand, an adversary in many ways
more dangerous than those carrying weapons.</i>

08:33.513 --> 08:36.004
Mass marketing, handled.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.490
- Shh.
- Yeah, of course, Jack. Anything.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.859
And if you guys get there
before we get there...

08:54.033 --> 08:56.297
...you can just get in the backyard
and set up...

08:56.469 --> 09:01.304
...and do what you gotta do.
- Dax, Dax. Go film over the top.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.034
Okay. Really, we appreciate that.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.111
Oh, uh... I have to call you back, sir.
I'm sorry.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.475
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out of here!

09:09.649 --> 09:13.050
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Guys. Hey, guys, what the fuck?

09:14.654 --> 09:16.781
Are you fucking with me right now?

09:16.956 --> 09:19.254
Look.
That was a business call for your party.

09:19.425 --> 09:21.393
Who takes a shit and makes a business call?

09:21.561 --> 09:23.688
Are you kidding?
Now you can shit in peace.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.798
Come on, dude. I can't see a thing.
It's dark as fuck in here.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.498
Dax, come on. Let's get closer.

09:32.705 --> 09:35.674
Heh, heh.
It should be pretty cool, I think.

09:35.841 --> 09:37.274
Basically chill.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.104
I'm letting Costa plan most of it.

09:39.278 --> 09:42.645
Oh, that sounds like a really
brilliant idea.

09:42.815 --> 09:46.683
No, he's doing a good job. He's getting,
like, a bunch of booze and then...

09:46.852 --> 09:48.615
...I think, like, a DJ.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.621
- A DJ. Super chill.
- Ha.

09:51.824 --> 09:55.555
Guess what Mama Kub
and Papa Kub got for...

09:55.728 --> 09:58.891
- Baby Kub?
... Baby Kub for his birthday.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.056
- What?
- The Kub Mobile.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.531
- They gave you the minivan?
- For my birthday, yes.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.534
Your parents give the worst gifts ever.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.332
- Where's your present?
- You serious?

10:07.506 --> 10:09.701
You haven't gotten me a present
in 10 years.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.274
So?

10:12.678 --> 10:16.637
But since I am a better friend than you,
I did get you something.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.444
- Oh.
- I'll bring it tonight. Hey, I have to go run.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.951
- Happy birthday, loser.
- Ow.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.887
- Don't trip.
- Ow!

10:25.057 --> 10:27.685
Oh, shit!
I'm okay! Heh.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.522
Thomas, suck my cock.
What?

10:30.696 --> 10:34.257
- "Mama Kub and Papa Kub"? Jesus.
- Yeah, those are my parents, asshole.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.760
Damn, she's so fucking hot, dude.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.798
- Think she'll come tonight?
- I'm not inviting her. You do this one.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.603
Alexis won't come.
She fucks college dudes.

10:50.683 --> 10:54.119
"Lamel"? What? I don't know any Lamel.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.446
No, he's cool.

10:55.621 --> 10:58.590
Guys, the last thing I want in my house
is a bunch of randoms.

10:58.758 --> 11:01.591
Wrong. Last thing you want
is nobody at your fucking house.

11:01.761 --> 11:05.663
The more word gets around, the more likely
these chicks will show up at our party.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.795
Watch and learn how
Captain Big Dick does it.

11:12.705 --> 11:15.367
Hey, girls. Just remember,
wear something tight.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.903
What's up, sisters?
Thomas Kub's house, 8:00.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.207
Come get a piece of this white chocolate.

11:23.382 --> 11:26.044
Are you gonna be going to
Thomas's birthday party tonight?

11:26.218 --> 11:28.345
- Thomas? Who's that?
- Who's Thomas?

11:32.091 --> 11:35.060
That thing that dick in
the sweater vest was telling us about?

11:35.227 --> 11:37.058
What's up, baby? Eight o'clock.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.200
What are your expectations
for the party?

11:43.369 --> 11:46.099
Get high, fuck bitches, you already know.

11:46.272 --> 11:49.400
- I think we'll come. Can we bring people?
- Can I bring people?

11:49.575 --> 11:51.702
Thomas Kub's house, 8:00.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.379
Oh, shit!

12:01.220 --> 12:02.244
Ahh!

12:04.056 --> 12:07.457
What we are witnessing is truly
a breathtaking moment...

12:07.626 --> 12:09.617
...in the life of young Thomas.

12:09.795 --> 12:14.698
The helpless fetus is growing
a tiny, tiny penis...

12:15.067 --> 12:20.232
...a penis he may someday insert
into this female's vagina...

12:20.539 --> 12:26.136
...should he survive his first encounter
without her eating him.

12:39.825 --> 12:41.816
Paper towels. Get long.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.985
- Don't!
- Dude, get a ton.

12:44.163 --> 12:47.564
Oh, shit. Extra-large condoms.
I'm not paying for that shit.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.528
Attention, valued shoppers.

12:51.704 --> 12:52.728
Oh, my God.

12:52.905 --> 12:56.341
Join us for an evening of balls-deep
entertainment at Thomas Kub's house.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.999
Dude, stop.

13:01.213 --> 13:05.274
Hey, little buddy.
Want something to drink? Hey.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.648
He's gonna catch him
and he's gonna get his ass kicked.

13:13.025 --> 13:15.152
You guys, we good on OJ?
Sunny D, dude.

13:15.327 --> 13:17.625
Grab it. Throw it in. I love...

13:17.797 --> 13:19.162
How are we doing on eggs?

13:21.133 --> 13:23.567
Holy shit, dude. It's Miles Teller.

13:24.904 --> 13:27.702
- Dude, it is. That's him. Holy shit.
- He's so badass.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.239
Yeah, my boy's starting
at second base for USC.

13:30.409 --> 13:32.877
He got sent to detention once
and banged the teacher.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.036
Mi-Tell, what's cracking, bro?

13:35.214 --> 13:37.808
- We go to North Pass.
- Yeah, dude, big fans.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.645
- Huge fans.
- Cool. Awesome.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.720
Look, we're making a movie.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.320
Invite him, man. Come on.
All right. Okay. Um...

13:46.492 --> 13:51.691
We're having a soirée at my place tonight.
If you wanna swing by, it should be...

13:51.864 --> 13:54.059
My boy is underselling this
like a motherfucker.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.599
This shit's gonna be legit.
You should swing by.

13:56.769 --> 14:00.205
Yeah, I can't. I actually got other plans
tonight, so I might not make it.

14:00.372 --> 14:04.365
Dude, think about it. It's on Dickens Street.
We'd love to have you.

14:04.543 --> 14:06.443
- Uh, Dickens Street?
- Yeah.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.477
That's your party? You're throwing that?

14:08.647 --> 14:10.911
That's where I'm going.
Heard it's gonna be crazy.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.847
That's my party. I'm Thomas Kub.
It's my birthday today.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.579
Yeah, I heard it's gonna be unlimited
high-school pussy.

14:16.755 --> 14:19.053
Dude, high-school pussy for days.

14:19.225 --> 14:22.126
What? Mind your own business, lady.

14:22.294 --> 14:24.319
How you guys doing on liquor?
You got liquor?

14:24.496 --> 14:25.520
Uh...

14:25.698 --> 14:28.963
Don't even worry about it, man.
I'll bring it, call my boys up.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.625
- Don't want you to sweat anything.
- Thank you so much.

14:31.804 --> 14:34.238
Hey, it's your day. Cool.
See you guys tonight, then.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.237
- All right, cool.
- Dickens Street.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.275
- Teller, bring your mitt. We'll play catch.
- No.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.436
- Fuck.
- "Bring your mitt"? The fuck?

14:41.614 --> 14:43.605
<i>Nothing like black pussy on my dick</i>

14:43.782 --> 14:45.545
<i>Word to the motherfucking DJ Quik</i>

14:45.718 --> 14:48.152
Okay, here's what I want.

14:48.687 --> 14:51.349
Party's limited to the backyard, okay?

14:51.523 --> 14:54.424
The house'll be locked
and the alarm'll be set.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.355
- No one is going inside, all right?
- Stop.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.656
- Throw down in the bushes?
- I don't care.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.995
If I don't fuck a girl with big tits tonight,
I'm drowning myself.

15:03.168 --> 15:06.228
Don't care if she's 300 pounds.
I have to fuck a girl with big tits.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.305
Oh, my God.
Feel my drift, J. B?

15:08.474 --> 15:09.566
Sure do.

15:09.742 --> 15:14.179
I mean, I'd love to get some oral or,
you know, at least do some finger-banging.

15:14.346 --> 15:17.110
What? Finger-banging?
Can you please elaborate?

15:17.316 --> 15:20.342
You take your first finger,
your thumb and your middle finger.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.451
Make a "come here" motion. "Come here. "

15:22.621 --> 15:25.181
This is called "machine guns"
or "friendly scissors. "

15:25.357 --> 15:27.791
The "circle of pleasure. "
The "itsy-bitsy spider. "

15:27.960 --> 15:29.928
Tapping and circling. Tap, tap, tap.

15:30.095 --> 15:32.359
Keep telling her how pretty
she is the whole time.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.998
Shut the fuck up!

15:34.166 --> 15:36.634
- Your loss, man. It's good knowledge.
- Oh, my God.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.965
Straight up here, then take a right again.
All right, listen.

15:40.139 --> 15:43.939
The three of us will have full access
to the house for sex and finger-banging.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.304
Yes.
But no one else, okay?

15:46.478 --> 15:48.469
Of course, bro, we got your back.

15:48.647 --> 15:50.012
- Hey, take a right.
- Here?

15:50.182 --> 15:52.878
You're gonna want to lock your doors.
Are you serious?

15:53.052 --> 15:55.714
Yes, I'm serious.
Where the fuck are we going?

15:55.888 --> 15:58.789
T- Rick's.
Gotta score some of that chronic shit.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.449
Are you sure this guy's cool?
T- Rick's the coolest.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.824
He's ex-military. Wait till you see
his gun collection. Fucking insane.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.328
This place is ghetto as fuck.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.831
Why do we have to come
all the way here? We can't just get it at school?

16:10.002 --> 16:12.800
Where do you think the school gets it?
This is wholesale.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.440
You are literally retarded.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.802
Ah, shut the fuck up.

16:18.243 --> 16:20.177
Ah! Fuck.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.938
T- Rick, open up.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.649
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, what's up, bro?

16:27.820 --> 16:30.550
- I haven't seen you in a minute, Costa.
- Yeah.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.419
- Nice to see you.
- How are you doing? Everything copacetic?

16:33.592 --> 16:36.152
Everything's great. You upgraded the dish.
Looks great.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.296
Yeah, I fucking did, upscaled it.

16:38.464 --> 16:40.125
- Upscaled it. I fucking did.
- Yeah.

16:40.299 --> 16:42.233
- These are my boys, J.B. And Thomas.
- Hi.

16:42.401 --> 16:45.029
All right, yeah, yeah.
Come on in, come on in.

16:50.109 --> 16:54.341
Oh, yeah, that was a 12-millimeter
semi-automatic Mossberg Maverick.

16:54.513 --> 16:57.914
- I'd love to go to the range with you.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

16:58.083 --> 17:01.348
Going on the range,
get it all out of your system.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.888
Pretend you're killing cops, if you want.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.990
<i>You're beautiful</i>

17:06.825 --> 17:09.953
<i>You're beautiful, it's true</i>

17:11.829 --> 17:14.195
<i>I saw your face</i>

17:14.867 --> 17:16.858
<i>In a crowded place</i>

17:17.036 --> 17:20.267
All right, well, I'll get your stuff.
Here, stoke up the fires, buddy.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.339
Oh, man, you the man.
Fuck, yeah, T-Rick.

17:22.508 --> 17:24.407
Yeah, kick ass with that.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.734
Hey, can we get going?

17:28.847 --> 17:31.714
Costa, come sit down, dude.
He's about to fucking...

17:31.884 --> 17:34.853
Check it out.
What are you doing?

17:35.020 --> 17:36.453
Fucking stop.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.820
That's technically a homosexual act.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.351
I'm coming on Santa Claus's face.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.258
Costa, he's coming back.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.831
- Dax, take it, take it.
- What the fuck are you doing?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.662
Dude, are you stealing it?
No, we're just borrowing it.

17:50.836 --> 17:53.100
We need a fucking mascot for the party.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.338
Jesus Christ.

17:56.508 --> 17:58.032
Here you go.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.542
Let's do this, I gotta be at the dojo by 5.

18:00.712 --> 18:02.111
- Absolutely.
- Cool.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.383
See, I told you guys,
T- Rick's just a sweetheart. Mm.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.948
Smell it, J.B.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.955
- You little fucking cocksuckers!
- Oh, fuck!

18:13.125 --> 18:15.218
- Give me back my fucking gnome!
- Fuck!

18:15.394 --> 18:18.192
Give him the gnome back.
Give him the fucking gnome back.

18:18.363 --> 18:20.388
No, fuck that! Just go.
Get out of here!

18:20.566 --> 18:22.591
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!

18:23.669 --> 18:27.036
Holy shit, Thomas, he's fucking wild!
He's a fucking crazy man!

18:27.206 --> 18:29.606
Holy shit! He's gone! He fell off!

18:32.578 --> 18:34.603
- Holy shit, man!
- Holy shit!

18:38.083 --> 18:39.550
Shit, shit, shit!

18:39.718 --> 18:43.119
That's my boy Tom! That was
some serious fucking shit right there!

18:43.288 --> 18:44.721
What in the fucking world?

18:44.890 --> 18:47.450
Fuck. Shit.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.924
Oh, my God.
Shit.

18:50.262 --> 18:53.197
God, dude,
he fucking cracked my windshield.

18:53.365 --> 18:57.563
Fuck it, my cousin owns a body shop.
He can fix it, no problem, man.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.936
The kung fu no good here.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.938
- Oh, fuck! Holy shit!
- Give me back my gnome!

19:03.108 --> 19:06.839
Holy shit!
Guy's like the fucking Terminator! Jesus!

19:07.012 --> 19:10.641
- No, he was super pissed though.
- Dude scares the shit out of me.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.249
Hey, boss.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.783
What the fuck?

19:14.953 --> 19:17.717
There he is.
This is Everett and his boy Tyler.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.721
They're running security for the night.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.383
Are you serious? Are those nunchucks?

19:22.561 --> 19:23.721
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.989
- Look like ninjas.
- Ninjas are fucking pussies!

19:26.165 --> 19:27.598
- I love this kid.
- You know it.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.893
With these two,
we got nothing to worry about.

19:30.068 --> 19:31.899
- We're outside the Kub house.
- Hey.

19:32.070 --> 19:34.061
- We have bogeys.
- What up, Costa?

19:34.239 --> 19:35.638
Do I know you guys?

19:35.807 --> 19:38.071
We heard about your shindig tonight.
We want in.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.335
- You freshmen?
- Yeah.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.071
- Get the fuck out of here, man.
- Come on, dude.

19:42.247 --> 19:45.478
Are you still talking?
Get the fuck out of here.

19:45.884 --> 19:46.908
Dick!

19:49.488 --> 19:52.218
J.B., drop those bags.
We got work to do.

19:57.763 --> 20:00.027
Hi. Good evening, Mrs. Stillson.
My name's Oliver.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.723
This is my friend Jonathan.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.368
- And we're both friends of Thomas Kub's.
- Oh.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.096
Yeah, we're hosting a little birthday party
for Thomas.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.968
And we wanted to give you
the courtesy of informing you...

20:10.142 --> 20:12.770
...that there'd possibly be
a bit of party-related noise.

20:12.945 --> 20:16.176
I wanted to give you my number
in case you had problems or concerns.

20:16.348 --> 20:19.283
You're a very beautiful woman.
Call me anytime you want.

20:19.451 --> 20:22.545
- Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
- I mean that when I say that.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.915
You are very beautiful.

20:24.089 --> 20:26.148
A little party for Thomas. He lives there.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.587
Am I invited?

20:27.759 --> 20:29.954
- Yeah, dude, fine. Yeah, you can come by.
- Nice.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.528
Thank you very much.
Have a good time at your party.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.258
Thank you, I appreciate this.
Come by anytime you want.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.095
- All right, see you.
- All right.

20:37.269 --> 20:38.736
- Bye, baby.
- See you guys.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.247
DJ's over there.
Cool.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.284
- Um, got the bar set up over here.
- Nice.

20:55.454 --> 20:57.012
- Karaoke in the pool house.
- Nice.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.488
Holy shit, dude!
Where'd you get a bouncy-house?

21:00.659 --> 21:02.957
- Costa hooked it up.
- You know it, baby.

21:03.462 --> 21:07.057
Fifty bucks extra with the port-a-potty.
And they threw these in for free.

21:07.232 --> 21:10.599
Nice touch.
Why not? It's a birthday party.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.134
You wanna help? Do something.

21:12.304 --> 21:15.296
- Hey, Chubs, grab your twin brother there.
- Fucking dick.

21:15.474 --> 21:18.102
- Hey, dudes, check it out.
- Yeah, like that's gonna work.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.542
Yes, it is gonna work. Next time
your pool guy's here, he'll be like:

21:21.713 --> 21:24.978
"Excuse me, Mr. Kub. I seem
to have found some water in your semen. "

21:25.150 --> 21:26.879
That's fucking disgusting.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.157
J.B., I thought I told you to pick up ice.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.657
I did. It's in the freezer in the garage.

21:35.827 --> 21:38.694
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Getting in shape for the party.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.697
- The party's in three hours.
- It's mostly water weight.

21:41.867 --> 21:44.995
- Wrestlers do it all the time.
- Wrestlers also wrestle all the time.

21:45.170 --> 21:46.330
- Crank this thing up.
- No.

21:46.505 --> 21:48.837
It's not gonna work
unless you crank it up.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.474
Stop. Stop. Stop.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.737
- Let's go, come on.
- Dax. Dax, help me.

21:54.913 --> 21:57.347
- No, Dax, you're here to observe.
- Help me! Dax! Aah!

21:57.516 --> 22:02.681
Jesus Christ! Are you all right, dude?
Oh, my God, J.B., are you all right?

22:02.854 --> 22:06.119
An hour from now,
this place is a fucking madhouse.

22:06.291 --> 22:09.385
Not a madhouse, just gonna be a fun,
decent-sized party.

22:09.561 --> 22:12.860
Relax. For you. You.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.726
Me. Dax.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.834
Thank you, I don't drink alcohol.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.765
Okay, faggot.

22:18.937 --> 22:22.737
- To one sick fucking night.
- Cheers.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.874
<i>Come on over, over</i>

22:35.454 --> 22:36.478
Shit! Come on!

22:36.655 --> 22:39.522
Yes. How are you so fucking bad
at this game, Costa?

22:39.691 --> 22:42.216
Shut up, Kirby.
You're killing my concentration right now.

22:42.394 --> 22:44.362
Ha, ha! Thomas, come here!
Fucker!

22:44.529 --> 22:46.429
I'm kicking Costa's ass!

22:46.998 --> 22:48.522
Oh, watch this.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.691
Shit!
It looks like I win.

22:50.869 --> 22:53.201
- Fuck you.
- You guys, it's like 9:20 already.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.840
Dude, relax.
People are gonna show up. I promise, bro.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.703
- Getting late.
- I'll look like such a dick if no one shows.

22:58.877 --> 23:02.813
Shut the fuck up. It's pissing me off that
you don't trust me to know what I'm doing.

23:02.981 --> 23:06.212
I'm the hub of a large social circle.
I put the word out, it goes out.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.875
Okay, cool.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.419
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck are you wearing?

23:10.589 --> 23:13.114
My God.
Nice.

23:14.326 --> 23:17.853
- You're gonna get laid, dude.
- Ladies love a guy with class.

23:18.029 --> 23:20.293
Are you retarded?

23:21.266 --> 23:24.394
Jesus Christ, man.
Where do you even get shit like that?

23:24.569 --> 23:27.129
- Men's Wearhouse.
- Men's Wearhouse? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.440
What is it?

23:30.609 --> 23:34.045
Wow, dude, this is fucking...
I can't believe it fucking worked.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.442
What did I say?
Don't doubt the master, bitches!

23:50.061 --> 23:51.688
Dude, we done good.

23:51.863 --> 23:53.694
Jesus, all those chicks are really hot.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.856
They're coming in packs.
This is insane.

23:57.235 --> 24:00.204
<i>Beat it, I bet she let me

24:00.372 --> 24:03.068

24:03.241 --> 24:05.937
<i>Got my Smith and Wessie to protect me
So respect me</i>

24:08.280 --> 24:10.009
What up, baby girl?

24:10.215 --> 24:12.149
<i>Andretti on Pirelli
Make a movie out the getty</i>

24:12.317 --> 24:14.842
<i>Where my ring and my confetti?
I'm Kobe Bryant ready</i>

24:15.020 --> 24:16.647
<i>Pink rosé and chronic smelly</i>

24:16.855 --> 24:18.982
Dude, this is way more than 50 people.

24:19.157 --> 24:20.681
Of course it is, it's plus-one.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.052
That's fucking Alexis, dude.
She came, man.

24:25.230 --> 24:27.391
Damn, dude.
Whoa.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.102
Thomas, this is your party,
and she's the hottest girl here.

24:31.269 --> 24:34.261
- That better be yours tonight.
- Damn.

25:53.652 --> 25:56.746
<i>White trash party
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear</i>

25:56.922 --> 25:58.549
<i>And walk around the party without a care</i>

25:58.723 --> 26:01.658
- Where the fuck is your drink, Thomas?
- I'm between beverages.

26:01.826 --> 26:05.091
What the fuck does that even mean?
J.B., get this bitch a drink.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.753
Yeah, all right.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.900
<i>Everybody in the club gettin' tipsy</i>

26:11.670 --> 26:13.297
Who's that dude with the mustache?

26:13.471 --> 26:15.905
Oh, that's LaRosa. He graduated.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.474
When, in 1986?

26:18.643 --> 26:21.111
Hey, will you at least try
and have a good time?

26:21.279 --> 26:22.974
Whoo!

26:23.248 --> 26:24.715
Got it? You tie it?

26:24.883 --> 26:27.647
He's good. Ready to go.
Blast off.

26:32.123 --> 26:34.648
<i>Pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies</i>

26:34.826 --> 26:36.623
That is not fucking cool.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.422
Oh, my God, it's a flying dog!

26:38.597 --> 26:40.895
<i>'Cause, homey
That hood is tighter than Kenny's</i>

26:42.400 --> 26:44.197
<i>It's just like Up.</i>

26:44.369 --> 26:46.530
It's my fucking dog.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.002
I gotta record this.

26:48.173 --> 26:49.868
Are you serious right now?

26:50.041 --> 26:53.010
- Fuck this, I'm putting him inside.
- Let me help you.

26:54.312 --> 26:55.711
Hey.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.609
Can you imagine
if your mom ever saw that?

27:02.020 --> 27:03.282
<i>It's my fucking dog.</i>

27:03.455 --> 27:04.945
Poor Milo.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.792
I don't know. It's pretty funny.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.293
- Maybe I'll post it on YouTube.
- No, don't, don't, don't.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.761
Seriously, stop. Stop.

27:13.932 --> 27:17.129
Come on, you're way too easy. I love it.

27:17.302 --> 27:18.769
I hate you.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.003
You'll be okay, Milo. I promise.

27:27.412 --> 27:31.746
All right, well, um,
we better get back out there.

27:33.918 --> 27:35.681
Hey, yo, Kub. Hey, yo, what up, dog?

27:35.854 --> 27:37.378
Yo, what's up, bro?

27:37.555 --> 27:40.820
<i>Let me see what you got
Now shake that thing</i>

27:40.992 --> 27:43.017
- Hey, man, what's up?
- Nice party, man.

27:43.194 --> 27:45.992
Hey, thanks. Would you guys mind
getting off my dad's car?

27:46.164 --> 27:48.530
It's just he'll go crazy
if anything happens to it.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.065
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- All right.

27:50.235 --> 27:52.567
- Thanks, man, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, no problem.

27:52.737 --> 27:55.001
Thomas! You're taking a bullet
from me right now.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.403
- What is that?
- Tequila. Just fucking take it.

27:57.575 --> 27:59.440
- All right. Fuck, dude.
- Come here. Come on.

27:59.611 --> 28:02.136
Ladies, who wants to take a shot
with the birthday boy?

28:02.313 --> 28:04.372
- Hell, yeah.
- Whoa, uh... Oh.

28:04.549 --> 28:06.779
Careful.
She's a professional. Open up.

28:06.951 --> 28:09.317
Take it. Oh, my God,
she's got a deep throat.

28:09.487 --> 28:13.548
- Okay, open up, open up. Now.
- Yeah!

28:14.559 --> 28:16.857
<i>Say what
Bitch, I'm about to blow up</i>

28:18.363 --> 28:21.093
Pardon? Oh, hey.
Hey.

28:21.599 --> 28:24.033
- What's up, guys?
- Well, we did it.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.966
This is amazing. How did we get
all these people to show up?

28:27.138 --> 28:30.369
<i>Check it out, guys.
I'm pretty sure it's that girl from Playboy.</i>

28:30.542 --> 28:31.975
Who?
Oh, my God, it is her.

28:32.143 --> 28:35.340
<i>She graduated three years ago.
She's in Playboy's Pac-10 issue.</i>

28:35.513 --> 28:37.845
- Dibs.
- Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.745
Well, I want to declare it, just in case.

28:41.352 --> 28:43.217
- Whoa.
- Oh, shit.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.083
We're fucked!

28:46.257 --> 28:47.884
What? Oh, hey, what's going on?

28:48.059 --> 28:50.823
- There's people in the house!
- Oh, shit.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.428
- Hey, Costa.
- I'm understaffed.

28:52.597 --> 28:55.259
- Come on, I need your fucking help, man.
- Goddamn it.

28:55.433 --> 28:57.458
Wow. Whoa.

28:59.304 --> 29:02.899
Hey. Hey, hi. Hi. Welcome.
Welcome to party. Welcome, welcome.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.098
- Yo!
- Miles!

29:04.275 --> 29:06.266
Little dude. What's up, man?
How we doing?

29:06.444 --> 29:08.503
- That's Ashley, Rachel, Sarah.
- Hi, hi.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.945
I brought all these people to your party.
Fucking camera creeps me out.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.608
- Yeah, it's... Don't worry.
- Let's go.

29:14.786 --> 29:17.346
I'm talking about the fucking people
in the house.

29:17.522 --> 29:20.821
My parents are gonna crucify me
if anything gets fucked up.

29:20.992 --> 29:25.258
I don't care if everyone thinks I'm a dick.
I'm getting them out of the house. Now.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.625
Fuck, hey, stop, seriously.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.393
Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

29:31.102 --> 29:33.570
- Please don't embarrass me like this.
- Hey, listen up!

29:33.738 --> 29:35.399
Yeah, Thomas! Whoo!

29:38.877 --> 29:43.177
Yeah, bro! Birthday boy on the table!
That's what I like to see, baby.

29:43.348 --> 29:44.747
- You having a good time?
- Yeah.

29:44.916 --> 29:49.250
Come on, guys, let's start making
some drinks. Let's get crazy in this bitch.

29:56.161 --> 29:57.822
Can I help you, sir?

29:57.996 --> 30:00.464
- I'm here to see Thomas.
- First and last name, please.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.623
I'm Rob, the neighbor.
Who the fuck are you?

30:02.801 --> 30:05.861
- I'll ask the questions, sir.
- Exactly. Get the hell out of my way.

30:16.214 --> 30:18.205
- Rob, hey. What can I do for you, man?
- Hey.

30:18.383 --> 30:21.045
Look, man, I don't mean to be
a dick here or anything.

30:21.219 --> 30:24.677
Oliver came over earlier and told me
you guys were having a little party...

30:24.856 --> 30:26.118
...but this is too much.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.749
Yeah, we actually should be winding down,
like midnight, I mean, maybe 1.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.225
- Is that okay?
- No, it's not.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.728
The baby can't sleep,
Melinda works early tomorrow.

30:33.898 --> 30:36.765
Fuck, yeah!
My boy Rob is here to rage! Mwah!

30:36.935 --> 30:39.130
- Good to see you.
- Actually, I'm not raging.

30:39.304 --> 30:41.363
I'm telling Thomas
it's time to shut it down.

30:41.539 --> 30:43.530
You can't be serious.
This is a great party.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.768
I am serious, because it's 11:30 at night.
It's time to wrap it up.

30:46.945 --> 30:48.776
Hey, hey, hey.

30:48.947 --> 30:51.609
Why don't we bring everyone to the back,
lower the volume?

30:51.783 --> 30:54.115
Guys, this isn't a request.
The party's over.

30:54.285 --> 30:57.516
I guess we're just gonna have to
agree to disagree, then, aren't we?

30:57.689 --> 31:00.624
Listen to me, Thomas.
Either shut it down or I'm calling the cops.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.350
Ahh.

31:02.527 --> 31:04.757
Fine. Fuck it.
I'm calling the fucking cops... Aah!

31:04.929 --> 31:06.794
Fuck!
Oh, shit!

31:06.965 --> 31:09.593
Jesus fucking Christ!
What'd you do that for?

31:09.767 --> 31:12.600
Are you kidding me?
I will fucking kill you!

31:12.770 --> 31:15.637
The little fuck Tased me!
I'm definitely calling the cops now!

31:15.807 --> 31:18.503
You punched a kid in the face!
I'm calling the cops on you.

31:18.676 --> 31:22.009
Do it, genius. It's all on tape.
I just saw this motherfucker record it.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.705
All I got was you punching
that little child's face.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.180
Fuck you.

31:26.351 --> 31:27.613
Go home, Robert!

31:27.785 --> 31:29.844
It was just a kid, man!

31:31.489 --> 31:33.582
- Are you all right, man?
- Is he okay?

31:33.758 --> 31:35.225
You're a fucking champion.

31:35.393 --> 31:38.624
He sucker-punched you.
You'd own that bitch in a real fight.

31:38.796 --> 31:39.990
- You think so?
- I know so.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.155
Fuck that asshole. You're killing it, bro.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.893
- Yo, Costa, what's up?
- Yo, go in the back.

31:45.069 --> 31:48.835
I need you to dial back like 10, 15 percent.
You can't hard-charge all the time.

31:49.007 --> 31:51.066
All right? And lose the Taser, okay?

31:51.242 --> 31:53.472
- Got it.
- Get down here.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.875
We need a post
up at the cockbiter's house.

31:56.047 --> 31:59.574
If he calls the cops,
I want you to radio it over to me, okay?

32:02.487 --> 32:04.512
Get out of here. Go.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.730
Alexis was eye-fucking you,
and you got college girls on your dick.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.663
- You're golden!
- Dude, I'm so fucked.

32:17.835 --> 32:20.929
- Relax, man, everything's going great.
- Shit.

32:21.105 --> 32:24.097
Are you fucking kidding me?
Didn't I tell you two to fuck off?

32:24.275 --> 32:26.971
- Get down here now.
- Come on, there's like 200 people here.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.636
I don't care.
T, get these freshmen out of here.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.510
This is a party for grownups.
Let's fucking go.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.811
Makes no sense.
This kid's younger than we are.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.454
- How the hell did they get up there?
- Move it, fellas.

32:37.622 --> 32:40.386
- You too, get out of here.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.

32:40.558 --> 32:42.958
See, the kid's a pro.
We got nothing to worry about.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.618
Dude, you heard Rob, man.
What if he calls the cops?

32:45.797 --> 32:48.857
The guy isn't gonna do shit.
He punched a 12-year-old in the face.

32:49.033 --> 32:52.764
Thomas, everything's under control.
Let's just have some fun.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.030
I got this, okay?

32:58.409 --> 33:00.536
Cannonball, bitches!

33:08.920 --> 33:12.617
<i>I don't care for fancy things</i>

33:12.790 --> 33:16.749
<i>Or to take part in the vicious race</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:19.387
This is the Thomas Kub pool cam.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.498
Dude, check it out. Check it out.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.892
Whoa, whoa, whoa, read the sign, honey.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.696
Sorry, I don't make the rules.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.930
<i>Ray-Ban vision, these ain't no prescription</i>

33:30.541 --> 33:32.532
No fucking way.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.007
Dude, go over there.

33:34.178 --> 33:36.112
Do you fucking believe this?

33:43.021 --> 33:47.958
<i>In this, feelin' tremendous
Lenses darker than the tint on my Benzes</i>

33:48.126 --> 33:49.388
Yeah! Ha, ha!

33:58.903 --> 33:59.961
Whoo-hoo!

34:04.909 --> 34:07.400
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit! Fucking insane!

34:12.617 --> 34:15.848
Oh, my God.
Dude, that sign fucking worked.

34:16.020 --> 34:17.317
You gotta have faith, son.

34:17.487 --> 34:19.388
Would you like a glass of wine?

34:19.556 --> 34:23.186
We've got red, we've got white.
You know, Cabernet, Merlot.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.885
Just another beer would be great.

34:25.063 --> 34:26.530
Uh...

34:26.964 --> 34:28.362
Here we are.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.393
Whoa.

34:40.344 --> 34:43.141
Wow. Okay.

34:49.253 --> 34:50.514
J.B!

34:52.489 --> 34:55.618
How did this thing get up here?
Was someone in my parents' room?

34:55.793 --> 34:58.819
It's a gnome. I guess he gets around.
Who cares, man?

34:58.996 --> 35:00.987
Well, I just don't want people up here.

35:01.165 --> 35:03.133
Besides, it's creepy. Look at him.

35:04.869 --> 35:07.861
- J.B., what are you looking for?
- To see if your dad has condoms.

35:08.039 --> 35:09.199
I'm working on something.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.898
Only thing you're working on
is diabetes, you fat fuck.

35:12.076 --> 35:16.035
- Oh, dude, Alexis just texted me.
- What? What's it say?

35:16.214 --> 35:18.842
"Body shots for the birthday boy
right now"?

35:19.016 --> 35:21.814
- Dude, it's fucking on!
- Check it out.

35:21.986 --> 35:24.682
- J.B., seriously, what are you doing?
- Your dad is a freak.

35:24.856 --> 35:29.054
Stop. Give me that. Costa, stop, wait.
Costa, what are you doing?

35:29.227 --> 35:31.422
- Replying.
Don't. Here, don't send that.

35:31.596 --> 35:34.997
- Sent. Too late, man.
- What did you write?

35:35.733 --> 35:38.224
"I want your ass too, Mommy"?

35:38.402 --> 35:40.597
"I want your ass, Mommy"?
Who talks like that?

35:40.771 --> 35:42.762
I do. The shit works.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.807
Go. Go talk to her.

35:46.911 --> 35:47.935
Oh.

36:03.461 --> 36:06.430
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

36:14.472 --> 36:18.272
Wait. No, wait. What are you doing?
Not like that. Not like that.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.405
Like this.

36:24.148 --> 36:25.877
Put this in your mouth.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.605
Your turn.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.269
Kub! House phone! House phone!

36:58.416 --> 37:00.850
Shit. Sorry. Um...

37:01.419 --> 37:05.685
Excuse me. Sorry. Look out.
Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me.

37:05.856 --> 37:08.120
Oh, shit. Sorry.

37:15.266 --> 37:17.427
Dax, close that behind you.

37:17.602 --> 37:19.365
Shit! Dax, find the phone.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.638
Um, right, you know what?
Fuck it, just be quiet.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.267
<i>- Hello.
Thomas. Are you there?</i>

37:26.444 --> 37:27.911
<i>- Dad, hey.
- Where have you been?</i>

37:28.079 --> 37:29.842
<i>We've been trying your cell all night.</i>

37:30.014 --> 37:33.916
<i>- We agreed all my calls would be answered.
- I know. Yeah, I'm sorry about that.</i>

37:34.085 --> 37:36.553
We were out in the hot tub,
so I didn't have it on me.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.985
<i>I don't want to find wet towels
when we get home.</i>

37:39.156 --> 37:42.023
<i>- I want to come home to a clean house.
- Of course, definitely.</i>

37:42.193 --> 37:45.219
<i>- We were just calling... What was that?
- Dude, look at her.</i>

37:45.396 --> 37:47.364
<i>What was that? Thomas?</i>

37:47.531 --> 37:50.591
Nothing. That was Costa.
You're on speakerphone.

37:50.768 --> 37:53.566
<i>We just wanted to call one last time
before going to bed...</i>

37:53.738 --> 37:56.366
<i>...make sure you're all set for the night.</i>

37:56.540 --> 37:58.667
Yep, all good.

37:58.843 --> 38:02.301
I'm actually about to
go to sleep right now, so...

38:02.480 --> 38:05.244
<i>Great. Well, we'll see you Sunday.
Happy birthday, Thomas.</i>

38:05.416 --> 38:07.976
<i>- Thanks, Dad. Good night.
- Good night.</i>

38:16.294 --> 38:17.693
Holy shit.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.393
Fuck, yeah!

38:26.570 --> 38:28.299
Oh, shit, I think that's his dad.

38:28.472 --> 38:31.703
What? I'm not here to bust anybody.
I'm just here to party.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.537
- Ew!
- Come on, "Ew. "

38:33.711 --> 38:35.201
Give me a break. You got a ball?

38:35.379 --> 38:37.176
- Yeah, man.
- Let's do this.

38:37.348 --> 38:40.317
Here we go. Paxson for three.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.008
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

38:42.186 --> 38:46.213
Up high!
Come on, dude, right here. Yeah!

38:46.390 --> 38:48.415
Let me have that.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.358
<i>Hey</i>

38:59.070 --> 39:00.503
<i>Nasty, kid</i>

39:01.205 --> 39:02.399
<i>Hey</i>

39:02.573 --> 39:06.168
What's that, dude? Hold on,
I can't fucking hear a thing you're saying.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.106
Speak up, E.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.875
What? E...
What the fuck are you doing here?

39:13.050 --> 39:16.110
- What you gonna do about it, bitch?
- You're not invited, dickhead.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.551
Fucking asshole.

39:23.561 --> 39:24.585
Bro, what's happening?

39:24.762 --> 39:27.822
<i>Subject is arguing with
an overweight woman, most likely his wife.</i>

39:27.998 --> 39:30.933
<i>She wants him to call the police.
He wants to handle it himself.</i>

39:31.102 --> 39:33.229
<i>He's drinking. They're in the kitchen.</i>

39:33.404 --> 39:35.770
<i>I'm upstairs. Kids are asleep. Over.</i>

39:35.940 --> 39:37.339
Wait, you're in their house?

39:39.243 --> 39:41.939
Are you fucking kidding me?
E, get the fuck out now!

39:43.114 --> 39:45.309
Negative. I'm a ghost. Out.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.344
What the fuck am I gonna do with this kid?

39:48.519 --> 39:49.952
E! E!

40:19.717 --> 40:22.413
Are you having fun?
Yeah, I'm having a good time.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.520
It's pretty fucking crazy.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.350
Oh, my God.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.893
What was wrong with me?

40:32.062 --> 40:34.997
Wow, this was before Costa.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.634
Yeah, the good old days.

40:37.802 --> 40:40.430
Yeah, back when you were
still in the crew, right?

40:42.106 --> 40:43.937
You used to be so cute. What happened?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.336
Shut the fuck up.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.501
Still looks like me.

40:53.751 --> 40:56.845
Was that weird? I'm sorry.
Shit, that was weird, wasn't it?

40:57.021 --> 40:59.888
- No, it... It was a little weird. Heh.
- Fuck. Um...

41:05.463 --> 41:07.397
Cops on the way.
Get out, everybody! Now!

41:07.565 --> 41:10.056
Everybody in the back!
Get in the back now!

41:10.234 --> 41:13.829
What, are you over there? Get in the back!
Cops are coming! Hurry, let's move!

41:14.004 --> 41:18.100
Move it, move it! Let's go! Hurry up!
Cops are coming! Everybody in the back!

41:18.275 --> 41:20.869
Costa. Hey, Costa.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.478
Everybody get in the back!

41:22.646 --> 41:23.908
Hey, what's going on?

41:24.081 --> 41:27.414
The cops are on their way right now!
Oh, shit.

41:27.585 --> 41:32.113
Get in the back now!
Everybody move! Let's go!

41:33.390 --> 41:35.654
Keep going! Get in the back now!

41:36.126 --> 41:38.117
Get out, police.
They're on their way now.

41:38.295 --> 41:40.820
How do you know that?
Don't ask. My boy's in deep.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.296
Gotta clear this fucking beer out of here.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.264
Damn it.

41:46.070 --> 41:48.971
- Is that everything?
- Yeah. I got your chalice.

42:11.127 --> 42:13.061
Law enforcement currently on scene.

42:13.229 --> 42:16.096
Standing down, for now.

42:23.806 --> 42:27.367
- I don't hear anything.
- No, it doesn't sound like a party.

42:28.477 --> 42:31.275
Not a party that's still going, anyway.

42:39.989 --> 42:41.616
Here they come.

42:41.791 --> 42:44.225
- Evening, officers.
- Fellas having a party?

42:44.393 --> 42:47.521
Yeah, we're having a small little
birthday gathering for my friend.

42:47.696 --> 42:50.324
I'm the friend, my birthday.

42:50.499 --> 42:52.433
Lot of cars for a small party.

42:52.601 --> 42:55.593
Shh.

42:56.906 --> 42:58.874
Shh.

43:04.447 --> 43:06.278
The house? Whose is it?

43:06.449 --> 43:08.212
Is there a problem here, officers?

43:08.384 --> 43:10.318
We have a noise complaint.

43:10.486 --> 43:13.216
- You mind if we look around?
- I'd prefer if you didn't.

43:13.389 --> 43:16.222
- We're not asking.
- Excuse me, I'm not a lawyer or anything.

43:16.392 --> 43:18.485
Doesn't the law state that
you cannot enter...

43:18.661 --> 43:20.925
...through a private residence
without permission?

43:22.198 --> 43:24.462
Is there an adult here
we might speak with?

43:24.633 --> 43:27.397
You're speaking with one.
I'm 18 and a half years old, sir.

43:27.570 --> 43:31.165
And, of course, in my culture
I've been a man since my 13th birthday.

43:31.340 --> 43:33.706
So you're telling us we cannot come in?

43:33.876 --> 43:36.538
With all due respect,
technically the law says you cannot.

43:36.712 --> 43:38.771
But what we're saying is, you may not.

43:38.948 --> 43:42.611
I guess both are true. The law says
you cannot because we say you may not.

43:42.785 --> 43:46.448
All right, all right. Props on
the "can/may" bullshit. Very good.

43:46.622 --> 43:48.055
No doubt. Thank you, sir.

43:48.224 --> 43:51.489
Just keep the noise down
to a minimum, okay?

43:51.660 --> 43:53.184
Yes, sir. Of course.

43:53.696 --> 43:56.392
Don't make us come back.
You know what I mean?

43:56.565 --> 43:59.125
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh. Of course.

43:59.301 --> 44:00.393
- Good night.
- Officers.

44:00.569 --> 44:01.934
Night.

44:02.805 --> 44:06.866
"Technically the law states... "
Damn Internet.

44:07.276 --> 44:09.676
Everybody's a fucking attorney.

44:22.558 --> 44:25.550
- Fuck you.
- Dude, Costa. Seriously?

44:25.728 --> 44:26.820
- Fuck you.
- Come inside.

44:26.996 --> 44:29.556
Just come inside. Just forget about it.

44:40.943 --> 44:43.241
To the break of dawn, yo!

45:52.848 --> 45:55.180
Holy shit!
What the fuck are you doing?

45:57.186 --> 46:01.122
Thomas, my cousin can replace the window,
no problem. It's all good, man. I promise.

46:14.036 --> 46:17.631
- Where did you get this? It's my mom's.
- Come on, bro. I'm not gonna break it.

46:27.716 --> 46:29.684
Throw it in here, nice and low.

46:42.931 --> 46:44.023
They're pills!

46:44.199 --> 46:45.860
It's Ecstasy, bro!

46:58.447 --> 47:00.176
You heard about this on Craigslist?

47:00.349 --> 47:03.216
Craigslist, yeah. It's on the thing,
on the page, right there.

47:03.385 --> 47:05.615
Whoa, we are so fucked.

47:05.788 --> 47:08.052
Relax, man.
We need to tell Thomas.

47:08.223 --> 47:10.987
T- Rick's so burned out,
he probably forgot about it already.

47:11.160 --> 47:12.320
This is bad.

47:13.295 --> 47:16.526
Mom, Dad, it's me, Thomas.

47:16.699 --> 47:17.893
Um...

47:18.067 --> 47:20.661
I'm drunk. I mean, that's not an excuse.

47:20.836 --> 47:25.933
Hopefully we'll meet again,
so I can explain things.

47:26.608 --> 47:28.337
I don't really have an explanation...

47:28.510 --> 47:31.206
...other than fucking Costa
made me do it. So...

47:33.115 --> 47:34.776
- Fuck off!
- Dude, it's us.

47:34.950 --> 47:36.247
I know.

47:38.053 --> 47:40.521
What are you doing in here?
The whole party's outside.

47:40.689 --> 47:42.213
Have you seen my fucking house?

47:42.391 --> 47:44.951
We have a whole day
to fix this place up. It's all good.

47:45.127 --> 47:49.962
No, it's not all good, okay? I mean,
what about this? What if my parents see it?

47:50.132 --> 47:52.896
Nobody's gonna see this shit but us.
I promise.

47:54.803 --> 47:56.862
Where did all these people
even come from?

47:57.039 --> 47:58.700
You know a guy down there told me...

47:58.874 --> 48:01.866
...he found out about the party
on fucking Craigslist?

48:02.845 --> 48:05.143
My dad met my stepmom on Craigslist.

48:05.314 --> 48:07.475
So you put my address
on the fucking Internet?

48:07.649 --> 48:10.345
- Well, not just the Internet.
- Shut the fuck up, J. B!

48:10.519 --> 48:12.384
Wait, what the fuck is he talking about?

48:12.554 --> 48:16.581
I had Jesse Marco put out an e-mail blast
and I may have called a radio station or two.

48:16.759 --> 48:18.056
You motherfuckers!

48:18.227 --> 48:20.491
You were so nervous
about people not showing up.

48:20.662 --> 48:23.893
Dude, people are spilling shit,
breaking shit, probably stealing shit.

48:24.066 --> 48:25.727
It's out of control.

48:25.901 --> 48:28.961
I wasn't nervous. I wanted the party
to be big enough to be cool.

48:29.138 --> 48:32.505
- Dude, look, back in Queens...
- I'm fucking sick of hearing about Queens.

48:32.674 --> 48:35.336
We get it. Queens is awesome.
We're pussies. I don't fucking care.

48:35.511 --> 48:37.103
<i>I'm doin'me</i>

48:37.279 --> 48:41.113
<i>I'm livin'life right now, man
And this what I'm gonna do</i>

48:41.650 --> 48:43.550
Whatever happens, we can make this right.

48:43.719 --> 48:46.916
I'll fix this whole house myself if I have to.

48:47.089 --> 48:50.581
Your parents don't even come home
till Sunday. You just need to relax, man.

48:50.759 --> 48:53.785
- You want a massage, bro?
- No, no. Just, stop.

48:53.962 --> 48:55.930
This is my favorite song, guys.

48:56.098 --> 48:57.998
<i>But my body</i>

48:58.167 --> 48:59.896
<i>My body's</i>

49:00.068 --> 49:02.798
I can't believe, like,
you guys just did this to me.

49:02.971 --> 49:04.836
We did this for you.

49:05.974 --> 49:09.535
Look, man, I know you're not a drug guy,
and I respect that about you.

49:09.711 --> 49:12.179
- But right now, this is what you need.
- What is it?

49:12.347 --> 49:15.874
It's Ecstasy. It'll put the brakes
on your little freak-out. Just take it.

49:18.420 --> 49:21.355
All right. This won't totally,
like, fuck me up, will it?

49:21.523 --> 49:24.788
Of course it will, dude.
That's the whole point.

49:26.328 --> 49:27.625
Here.

49:28.730 --> 49:31.290
- Hey.
- You get half of one.

49:32.534 --> 49:35.059
<i>Baby</i>

49:35.270 --> 49:37.238
All right, just give me like 10 minutes.

49:38.607 --> 49:40.404
No fucking way, man!

49:40.809 --> 49:43.039
Ow! Get off me.
This is your night.

49:43.212 --> 49:47.581
Cut the music. Cut it.
How's everybody doing? It's your host, Costa.

49:47.749 --> 49:50.582
I'm gonna bring up my best friends,
Thomas and J.B.

49:50.752 --> 49:52.379
Get your asses up here right now.

49:52.554 --> 49:54.283
Come on, move your asses.

49:54.823 --> 49:56.552
Come on, J.B., move your fat ass.

49:56.725 --> 50:00.593
The reason you guys are here tonight
is because it's Thomas Kub's birthday.

50:00.762 --> 50:04.823
And we're gonna sing a little
"Happy Birthday" for him. One, two, three.

50:05.234 --> 50:09.694
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

50:09.872 --> 50:14.571
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

50:14.743 --> 50:20.045
<i>Happy birthday dear Thomas</i>

50:20.749 --> 50:24.446
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

50:26.822 --> 50:29.689
Thanks, everybody, for coming.
Let's get the music rocking!

50:29.858 --> 50:31.883
<i>Let's fucking lose it</i>

50:32.060 --> 50:34.255
<i>Get out of your mind</i>

50:34.429 --> 50:36.659
<i>Get out of your mind</i>

50:36.832 --> 50:39.665
<i>Get out of your mind
Fuck that shit</i>

50:39.835 --> 50:43.635
Fuck, yeah! What's up in this bitch?
Fuckers.

50:43.805 --> 50:46.273
Hey, baby, what's up?
Want some of this?

50:46.441 --> 50:49.501
Yeah!
The fuck you guys looking at?

50:50.279 --> 50:52.270
Whoa!

50:52.447 --> 50:54.881
- You got something to say?
- Buddy, what...? What the...

51:01.056 --> 51:03.616
Let me go! Goddamn it!

51:04.026 --> 51:05.653
Don't shut that...

51:05.827 --> 51:08.625
<i>Scuffin'shell-toes
Is that nigga dead?</i>

51:08.797 --> 51:10.856
Hey, have you seen Thomas?

51:11.033 --> 51:12.694
We're looking for him.

51:12.868 --> 51:16.099
Well, when you find him, can you tell him
I've got something for him?

51:16.838 --> 51:18.066
Jump in.

51:18.240 --> 51:20.538
You're breaking the rules, you know.

51:22.544 --> 51:24.171
Ew. Heh.

51:24.346 --> 51:26.712
Why won't you get in with me?

51:26.882 --> 51:30.443
It's just, like, I already went
swimming once against my will.

51:30.986 --> 51:32.647
Wetness.

51:33.055 --> 51:35.114
Ha, ha. Whoa.

51:35.290 --> 51:37.224
So, Thomas, are you having fun?

51:38.393 --> 51:39.587
- No.
- Not at all?

51:39.761 --> 51:42.423
- Yes.
- You look pretty fucked up.

51:42.598 --> 51:45.089
- I'm a little fucked up.
- But you look good.

51:45.267 --> 51:47.997
- Have you gotten lucky at all?
- I'm pretty lucky right now.

51:48.170 --> 51:49.501
Slow down, dude.

51:49.671 --> 51:51.536
Fine. Give me that.

51:51.707 --> 51:54.039
- Are you having fun at this party?
- So much fun.

51:54.209 --> 51:57.838
It's just that it's a small get-together.
It should be basically chill.

51:58.013 --> 52:01.210
Look how chill this is.
It's no big deal. I mean, there's two DJ's.

52:01.383 --> 52:04.511
That's not a big deal, right?
When do your parents get home?

52:04.686 --> 52:06.677
- I don't know.
- J.B., get your fat ass up!

52:06.855 --> 52:10.052
There's a midget in the oven.
Let's go. Come on.

52:10.225 --> 52:11.886
What?
What? What did he say?

52:12.060 --> 52:13.322
I heard, "midget in oven. "

52:16.798 --> 52:19.596
Move the fuck out of the way!

52:19.768 --> 52:21.201
Move the fuck out of the way!

52:21.370 --> 52:24.339
- I'm so sorry, sir. I'm so sor...
- Fuck!

52:24.506 --> 52:26.303
Hey, wrong guy. Wrong guy.

52:26.475 --> 52:29.535
- My God. Jesus Christ.
- No.

52:29.711 --> 52:35.877
Motherfucker! Motherfuckers!
You fucking cunt!

52:40.589 --> 52:42.454
Yo, yo, yo, hey!

52:42.624 --> 52:46.754
I just heard a rumor that all your balls
got attacked by a midget. Is it true?

52:46.928 --> 52:49.988
Please, please, just tell me it is.
I'm praying it fucking is.

52:50.165 --> 52:52.725
Dude, I can't believe I missed it.

52:54.336 --> 52:57.066
Look at your fucking pupils.

53:00.909 --> 53:02.774
- I love you guys.
- Ha, ha.

53:02.944 --> 53:04.343
No, seriously.

53:04.513 --> 53:07.277
Look, I realize I can be,
like, a huge dick sometimes...

53:07.449 --> 53:09.280
...and I'm really sorry for that.

53:09.451 --> 53:12.079
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

53:13.355 --> 53:17.758
J.B., I'm sorry for buying you a bra
on your birthday. That wasn't cool.

53:17.926 --> 53:19.860
It wasn't cool, man.

53:20.028 --> 53:23.156
And I'm sorry for all the times
I called you Fat Fuck.

53:23.331 --> 53:24.821
Mm.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.628
- Chubby Bitch.
- Yeah.

53:27.803 --> 53:30.465
- Fudgy the Whale.
- Okay.

53:30.639 --> 53:33.199
I'm sorry for that time
at your brother's Bar Mitzvah...

53:33.375 --> 53:36.833
...where I told everyone you look like
Rosie O'Donnell, because you don't.

53:37.012 --> 53:39.071
- I don't.
- Hey, guys?

53:39.247 --> 53:40.942
- What?
- Um...

53:41.616 --> 53:43.743
I hooked up with Kirby.

53:45.387 --> 53:47.878
I'm, like, really into her.

53:50.492 --> 53:53.723
Okay, seriously, Thomas,
that's, you know, cool and all.

53:53.895 --> 53:56.830
But she's kind of always been around.

53:56.998 --> 53:59.523
It's like hooking up with J.B.

54:00.202 --> 54:01.669
But her tits are smaller.

54:01.837 --> 54:04.397
- Hey.
- I'm just saying.

54:04.573 --> 54:07.201
Kirby's sort of like one of us.

54:07.375 --> 54:10.344
You know, tonight's about the girls
we never had a shot at.

54:10.512 --> 54:14.107
Tonight's about changing the game.

55:57.586 --> 55:59.019
<i>Heads will roll</i>

55:59.187 --> 56:00.916
<i>Heads will roll</i>

56:01.089 --> 56:02.522
<i>Heads will roll</i>

56:03.892 --> 56:05.484
It's crazy out there.

56:05.660 --> 56:07.321
I haven't seen Tyler in an hour.

56:12.033 --> 56:14.058
We were slightly out of our league
on this mission.

56:19.641 --> 56:21.438
- Cool room.
- Thanks.

56:22.811 --> 56:24.403
It's a bit messy right now.

56:25.747 --> 56:27.578
Here, let me...

56:32.387 --> 56:34.582
So it's your birthday.

56:34.756 --> 56:37.748
Yeah, it's my birthday.

57:07.122 --> 57:08.646
Oh.

57:11.293 --> 57:13.727
<i>I know where they build 'em</i>

57:13.895 --> 57:17.353
<i>I know where they're selling long</i>

57:21.303 --> 57:25.467
<i>Wider than the worst ones
Wider than the one I know</i>

57:26.841 --> 57:28.968
Oh, my God. Thomas?

57:29.144 --> 57:30.509
Kirby.

57:30.679 --> 57:32.510
- Fuck off.
- I'm sorry. Hey, hey, Kirby...

57:32.681 --> 57:35.115
Thomas, what the fuck?

57:35.884 --> 57:37.613
Asshole.

57:41.723 --> 57:44.886
- Would you like a hand with that?
- How long have you been in there?

57:45.060 --> 57:46.687
- Fucking shit!
- What are you doing?

57:58.573 --> 57:59.597
Kirby!

58:00.408 --> 58:01.534
Kirby!

58:52.327 --> 58:54.488
Alexis, are you having a good time?

58:54.662 --> 58:55.959
No. I'm leaving.

59:13.581 --> 59:17.108
<i>Hi. You've reached
the Kub residence. Please, leave a message.</i>

59:17.285 --> 59:19.446
<i>Thomas, it's me again.
I'm fucked, dude.</i>

59:19.621 --> 59:23.921
<i>I just got another call.
I'm sure the neighbors are exaggerating.</i>

59:24.092 --> 59:26.652
<i>- Please call me.
- Fuck.</i>

59:32.734 --> 59:34.463
<i>Your style and your physique</i>

59:34.636 --> 59:37.969
<i>And I ain't tryin' to critique
But you deserve a good drink, so, what's up?</i>

59:38.139 --> 59:40.164
<i>What you sippin'on?
It's no problem</i>

59:40.341 --> 59:43.367
<i>Black and gold bottles
Like I'm pro-New Orleans</i>

59:43.545 --> 59:48.573
<i>But, shorty, I'm far from a saint
But I got two AmEx's that look the same way</i>

59:48.750 --> 59:53.653
<i>Wale, D.C., that's me, huh
My Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fila</i>

59:53.822 --> 59:56.313
<i>I ain't gotta tell you
They know about me, huh</i>

59:56.491 --> 59:59.085
<i>Come to D.C. And I can make you a believer</i>

59:59.260 --> 01:00:02.024
<i>See, baby, I'm a leader
Day away from a Libra</i>

01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:04.688
<i>I ain't tryin' to lead you wrong, sugar
I need you</i>

01:00:04.866 --> 01:00:07.130
<i>So would you please listen
To what I'm gonna need from you</i>

01:00:07.302 --> 01:00:09.600
<i>Live for tonight
Before tomorrow's amnesia</i>

01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:14.470
<i>Pretty girls
I ask them do they smoke</i>

01:00:15.376 --> 01:00:17.367
Holy shit!

01:00:18.346 --> 01:00:19.973
It's fucking insane.

01:00:37.065 --> 01:00:41.024
Thomas, look at what we did. Epic.

01:00:44.339 --> 01:00:46.899
Is this big enough to be cool?

01:00:48.176 --> 01:00:49.609
Game changer.

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:53.240
Holy shit, it's the news.

01:01:00.822 --> 01:01:01.914
Dude, that's Thomas!

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:05.059
<i>Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</i>

01:01:05.226 --> 01:01:07.160
Are you hearing this?

01:01:07.328 --> 01:01:12.027
<i>Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</i>

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.895
This is your fucking party, man.

01:01:14.869 --> 01:01:17.064
You're right, dude. I needed this.

01:01:21.276 --> 01:01:22.470
Fuck, yeah!

01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:34.284
Look at me now, bitches!
My party is the shit!

01:01:34.856 --> 01:01:37.484
My party is legendary!

01:01:39.994 --> 01:01:42.428
<i>Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</i>

01:01:42.597 --> 01:01:44.258
- Watch this.
- Watch what?

01:01:44.432 --> 01:01:48.425
Are you kidding me?
Hey, all you bitches. Aah!

01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:52.705
<i>Know me from the you know
Boss in my Hugo</i>

01:01:55.677 --> 01:01:58.145
Thomas, you crazy motherfucker!
I love you!

01:02:01.516 --> 01:02:05.953
<i>Jump! Jump! Jump!</i>

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.884
Fuck that shit. I'm not jumping.
Fuck that.

01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:11.690
<i>Jump! Jump! Jump!</i>

01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:17.420
To my family members,
all my friends on Facebook...

01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:19.123
- What?
- It's been a great ride.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.394
- Costa, hold on to these.
- J.B., don't do it, man.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.299
- You're way too fat.
- Shut up.

01:02:30.945 --> 01:02:32.310
Yeah!

01:02:40.288 --> 01:02:42.279
Oh, my God!

01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:47.423
J.B., you all right, man?

01:02:48.129 --> 01:02:50.529
- J.B., you all right?
- Ha-ha-ha!

01:03:01.542 --> 01:03:02.600
This is Falcon One.

01:03:02.777 --> 01:03:05.746
I was just attacked
by this really sexy woman.

01:03:05.913 --> 01:03:08.541
We've lost all control.
The house was breached hours ago.

01:03:08.716 --> 01:03:10.183
Chaos has spread to the streets.

01:03:10.351 --> 01:03:13.115
And the police are returning in force.
We're clearly outnumbered.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:23.156
God, help us.

01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:30.328
Assholes!

01:03:38.913 --> 01:03:42.815
<i>Cops go home! Cops go home! Cops go home!</i>

01:03:42.984 --> 01:03:44.918
This is the police.

01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:48.715
Disperse peacefully and immediately
or you will be subject to arrest.

01:03:59.667 --> 01:04:01.430
In need of immediate assistance.

01:04:03.504 --> 01:04:04.698
Drive, drive, drive!

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:09.673
Requesting backup, all units...

01:04:27.428 --> 01:04:28.486
Holy shit!

01:04:28.663 --> 01:04:30.563
I jumped off the house on purpose.

01:04:34.435 --> 01:04:36.630
<i>Chaos has broken out in the Southland...</i>

01:04:36.804 --> 01:04:41.332
<i>...where this normally quiet residential
street has turned into anarchy.</i>

01:04:50.985 --> 01:04:54.284
<i>I'm joined now by Captain Reesman
of the Police Department.</i>

01:04:54.455 --> 01:04:57.583
<i>We'll have to let this thing burn out
before we even think about moving back in.</i>

01:05:28.189 --> 01:05:30.248
Shit, that's my dad's car.
Shit, dude.

01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:32.751
Oh, shit.

01:05:39.333 --> 01:05:41.392
Oh, shit!

01:05:52.914 --> 01:05:55.144
Are you kidding me?

01:05:58.152 --> 01:06:00.416
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:06:00.588 --> 01:06:02.180
Fuck your car!

01:06:05.059 --> 01:06:06.151
Motherfuckers!

01:06:07.962 --> 01:06:10.988
Oh, my God, Thomas, we're fucked.

01:06:11.165 --> 01:06:13.133
I don't know how to fix this.

01:06:14.368 --> 01:06:16.893
I don't know how to fix any of this shit.

01:06:17.071 --> 01:06:21.167
I'm sorry, Thomas.
I just wanted to get some pussy.

01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:27.844
<i>And something's just happening right now.
I've heard a commotion.</i>

01:06:29.884 --> 01:06:31.351
Holy shit!

01:06:35.223 --> 01:06:37.020
What the fuck is that?

01:06:37.191 --> 01:06:38.522
Whoa!

01:06:41.729 --> 01:06:42.923
<i>Outside visual on subject with...</i>

01:06:43.097 --> 01:06:44.655
Everybody, back!

01:06:47.835 --> 01:06:49.393
Fuck! You guys, come on!

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:52.038
- Come on, get the fuck out of here! Move!
- Come on!

01:06:52.206 --> 01:06:54.834
Go! Shit!
Come on!

01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:58.034
Whoa! What the fuck, dude! Get down!

01:06:58.212 --> 01:07:00.180
- Holy shit! Look out.
- Shit! What the fuck?

01:07:01.749 --> 01:07:05.549
<i>Subject is armed and active.
Oh, my fucking God.</i>

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.850
<i>Police are on scene in riot gear.
SWATofficers are rushing forward.</i>

01:07:10.024 --> 01:07:12.117
<i>All units hold for SWAT team arrival.</i>

01:07:15.396 --> 01:07:17.364
Fuck!
Holy shit, dude, it's T-Rick!

01:07:17.532 --> 01:07:21.366
- What the fuck is he doing?
- Costa!

01:07:21.536 --> 01:07:24.869
Give me back my fucking gnome!

01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:28.304
- Give it to him. Where is it?
- It was full of Ecstasy. Everyone ate it!

01:07:28.476 --> 01:07:31.343
Where the fuck is Costa?

01:07:31.512 --> 01:07:33.343
<i>Subject is advancing.</i>

01:07:37.251 --> 01:07:39.378
Whoa, shit!

01:07:41.055 --> 01:07:42.079
This is the police...

01:07:42.256 --> 01:07:43.951
<i>Approach with extreme caution.</i>

01:07:44.125 --> 01:07:47.424
Put down your weapon
and put your hands in the air.

01:07:47.595 --> 01:07:50.291
Get down! Show me your hands!
Put down your weapon!

01:07:50.464 --> 01:07:52.694
<i>Police are now firing rubber bullets.</i>

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:54.266
Drop it now!
Back up, back up!

01:07:54.435 --> 01:07:55.459
Get back!

01:07:56.571 --> 01:07:58.266
<i>Suspect is firing at officers.</i>

01:07:58.773 --> 01:08:01.537
- Fuck this.
- Where are you going? Get back here!

01:08:01.709 --> 01:08:02.835
Dude, Thomas, no!

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.501
Look, T-Rick, we can fix this.
Okay, man?

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.704
Fuck you!

01:08:06.881 --> 01:08:10.180
You burn me, I burn you!

01:08:10.351 --> 01:08:12.012
Thomas, get back here, dude!

01:08:12.186 --> 01:08:13.710
Costa, you motherfucker!

01:08:13.888 --> 01:08:16.118
Put down your weapon.
Put your hands in the air.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:17.416
- Go, go, go!
- Shit!

01:08:17.591 --> 01:08:19.457
Put down your weapon.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:21.457
Yeah. Now. Take the shot!

01:08:21.629 --> 01:08:22.857
Get the fuck out of here!

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:24.497
Go!

01:08:26.033 --> 01:08:27.466
Get back. Get back!

01:08:28.202 --> 01:08:29.328
Fuck. Oh, my God.

01:08:29.502 --> 01:08:31.163
<i>Still active and on the move.</i>

01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:34.865
<i>Heading toward residence.</i>

01:08:37.211 --> 01:08:39.042
Holy shit!

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:43.741
This is the police.

01:08:44.618 --> 01:08:46.712
Disperse immediately.

01:08:47.455 --> 01:08:48.546
Oh, my God.

01:08:48.723 --> 01:08:51.385
Disperse immediately
or you will be subject to arrest.

01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:53.685
This is the police.

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:00.867
- We gotta get out of here.
- I can't leave my house.

01:09:01.035 --> 01:09:02.935
The house is gone, man.
It's fucking over.

01:09:03.104 --> 01:09:05.834
- Where's Milo?
- This is the police.

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:15.372
Disperse immediately.

01:09:20.354 --> 01:09:21.514
Go, go!

01:09:22.622 --> 01:09:24.750
I hear him here.

01:09:24.925 --> 01:09:27.984
What the fuck are you doing?
The dog's not gonna be in that drawer.

01:09:28.162 --> 01:09:30.493
Here he is! I got him! Motherfuckers!

01:09:30.665 --> 01:09:32.189
Come on, let's go. Move!

01:09:39.774 --> 01:09:41.765
It's complete chaos out here.

01:09:41.942 --> 01:09:45.844
Police are using flash-bang grenades
to try and disperse this crowd.

01:09:46.013 --> 01:09:47.274
This is the police.

01:09:47.448 --> 01:09:49.746
Disperse immediately.

01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:53.444
If you do not disperse immediately,
you will be subject to arrest.

01:09:55.256 --> 01:09:56.621
Go! Go!

01:09:56.791 --> 01:10:00.227
<i>Police are now mobilizing.
Fire helicopters have been brought in.</i>

01:10:00.394 --> 01:10:03.227
<i>They're dropping water
to put this blaze out.</i>

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:16.004
<i>Scene in progress,
50 yards ahead of IC. Officers need assistance.</i>

01:10:16.177 --> 01:10:17.974
Holy shit!

01:10:18.145 --> 01:10:20.579
Tyler, I need you! Pull it together!

01:10:23.551 --> 01:10:25.644
<i>Civilians 50 yards ahead on Dickens.</i>

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:30.120
<i>- Officers engaged with riot...
- What is going on?</i>

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:32.521
- Stay down. Stay down.
- Fuck! Shit!

01:10:34.361 --> 01:10:35.851
Milo!

01:10:36.764 --> 01:10:38.459
- Dude, Milo!
- Hey, Oliver!

01:10:38.632 --> 01:10:40.259
Great party, buddy.

01:10:40.434 --> 01:10:42.163
You owe me a tree, you piece of shit.

01:10:42.336 --> 01:10:46.705
All we're doing is trying to have a good time,
you cocksucking motherfucker!

01:10:46.874 --> 01:10:50.105
You know where you're going?
You're going to jail, you motherfucker!

01:10:50.277 --> 01:10:55.044
Yeah! That's my boys! Suck my dick, Robert!
Suck my fucking dick!

01:11:00.688 --> 01:11:01.780
Fuck! Shit!

01:11:01.956 --> 01:11:05.016
<i>Black sedan. License plate...
We've got a hit-and-run.</i>

01:11:05.192 --> 01:11:08.457
Go, go, go!
Run! Run!

01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:10.460
<i>Unit 23, what's your status?</i>

01:11:15.269 --> 01:11:18.705
<i>Skirmish line, be advised,
officer down, officer down.</i>

01:11:37.458 --> 01:11:41.485
He's home alone. He's been up
all night, so he's probably gonna crash soon.

01:11:41.662 --> 01:11:45.393
We wait about an hour to make sure
he's asleep, then we make our move.

01:11:45.566 --> 01:11:48.433
We go in the back, break Rob's door down,
and torch the house.

01:11:48.602 --> 01:11:50.661
- Yeah.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:11:50.838 --> 01:11:54.001
The guy has a wife and a baby.
You're not gonna burn his house down.

01:11:54.175 --> 01:11:56.302
He called the cops on us.
He ruined everything.

01:11:56.477 --> 01:12:00.846
It's 6 in the morning, man.
Let it go. It's over.

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:03.312
Just go home.

01:12:09.757 --> 01:12:11.384
What about our money?

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:16.693
The house is trashed.
You're the worst security ever.

01:12:28.042 --> 01:12:29.703
You guys should go home too.

01:12:31.979 --> 01:12:33.947
You gonna be okay, man?

01:12:34.448 --> 01:12:37.281
Yeah, I'm just gonna hang here
with Milo for a bit.

01:12:42.923 --> 01:12:43.947
All right.

01:12:44.692 --> 01:12:46.592
I'm gonna go home...

01:12:47.561 --> 01:12:51.361
...have a good cry,
and start calling some lawyers.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.967
Thomas, whatever happens, man...

01:12:57.037 --> 01:12:59.904
...that was one fucking hell of a night.

01:13:00.407 --> 01:13:02.773
Come on, J.B., let's bounce.

01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:29.565
You can go too, Dax.

01:13:32.606 --> 01:13:34.403
Thanks, Thomas.

01:13:34.775 --> 01:13:37.209
I had a really fun time.

01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:41.079
You'll be all right.

01:13:56.897 --> 01:13:58.922
<i>Kevin and Bean
from the world-famous KROQ.</i>

01:13:59.099 --> 01:14:03.035
<i>Can we talk about this insanity
in Pasadena last night?</i>

01:14:03.203 --> 01:14:05.034
<i>It looked like the greatest party ever.</i>

01:14:05.205 --> 01:14:07.036
<i>Big Boy's neighborhood, beautiful day.</i>

01:14:07.207 --> 01:14:09.607
<i>It is going down.
I don't know if you seen the news.</i>

01:14:09.777 --> 01:14:13.873
<i>But some cats had a party in Pasadena
and took this thing to the whole next level.</i>

01:14:14.048 --> 01:14:18.007
<i>I'm talking about, they trashed the
neighborhood. They trashed the house.</i>

01:14:18.185 --> 01:14:20.244
<i>We heard that Kanye
made an appearance there.</i>

01:14:20.421 --> 01:14:23.913
<i>Yeah, so if you were there at the party
in Pasadena last night, hit us up...</i>

01:14:24.091 --> 01:14:27.788
<i>...because we're gonna be talking about it
all morning long in the neighborhood.</i>

01:14:32.099 --> 01:14:35.591
- I really am sorry.
- You said that already.

01:14:38.339 --> 01:14:42.400
Do you have any idea how much
all this is gonna cost, Thomas?

01:14:44.845 --> 01:14:47.507
Your college fund is gone,
I can tell you that.

01:14:49.483 --> 01:14:52.043
- Yeah. Dad, I'm sorry.
- You had so much going for you...

01:14:52.219 --> 01:14:56.553
...and you just pissed it all away
for one night?

01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:03.093
I just didn't think you had it in you.

01:15:05.799 --> 01:15:09.326
Well, I know. I'm sorry I let you down.

01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:11.128
No.

01:15:11.405 --> 01:15:17.401
I literally didn't think
that you had this in you.

01:15:20.948 --> 01:15:24.440
So, uh, how many people were here?

01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:26.552
Uh...

01:15:28.155 --> 01:15:29.645
Fifteen hundred.

01:15:31.025 --> 01:15:33.186
Couple thousand, maybe.

01:15:33.927 --> 01:15:35.292
Wow.

01:15:36.797 --> 01:15:38.731
You should've seen it.

01:15:42.036 --> 01:15:43.901
It was awesome.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.432
Well, you're still fucked, Thomas.

01:16:03.724 --> 01:16:05.191
<i>It's the motherfucking D-O-double-G</i>

01:16:10.964 --> 01:16:12.932
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know who's back...</i>

01:16:14.368 --> 01:16:16.393
Well, at least the van
looks gangster now.

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:19.937
Dude, don't even start, okay?
My dad's making me drive it as punishment.

01:16:20.107 --> 01:16:21.836
That sucks.

01:16:22.009 --> 01:16:25.172
Yeah, and I'm being brought up on
like six different charges.

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:27.438
My mom hasn't stopped crying.

01:16:27.614 --> 01:16:30.014
We're living at a Courtyard Marriott
right now.

01:16:30.184 --> 01:16:32.311
I'm basically on house arrest
until my hearing.

01:16:32.486 --> 01:16:34.215
I'm not supposed to talk to you guys.

01:16:34.388 --> 01:16:37.846
My parents are convinced this is totally
gonna be fucking my college plans.

01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:40.220
Your grades are fucking up
your college plans.

01:16:40.394 --> 01:16:43.386
My dad got me a lawyer.
Even that Jew thinks we're fucked.

01:16:43.564 --> 01:16:46.362
- Thinks we could actually do time for this.
- Jesus.

01:16:46.533 --> 01:16:48.763
What about you, Dax?
What did your parents say?

01:16:48.936 --> 01:16:51.496
Oh, I live alone, actually.

01:16:52.773 --> 01:16:55.264
You're really starting
to fucking scare me.

01:16:57.377 --> 01:16:59.345
Yo, what up, Kub?

01:17:02.015 --> 01:17:03.710
What's going on, man?

01:17:03.884 --> 01:17:05.476
That's him.

01:17:09.389 --> 01:17:10.447
Hey, Costa.

01:17:10.624 --> 01:17:13.058
- Hi, Thomas.
- Thank you.

01:17:13.227 --> 01:17:15.058
Thank you.

01:17:17.097 --> 01:17:20.225
Yo, you guys, Thomas.
That party was dope.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.391
Thank you, man.
No, thank you, man.

01:17:22.569 --> 01:17:24.059
You guys rock.

01:17:29.376 --> 01:17:30.468
Thank you.

01:17:32.112 --> 01:17:33.636
J. B!

01:17:34.648 --> 01:17:37.811
<i>Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!</i>

01:17:55.602 --> 01:17:57.126
Kirby, wait.

01:17:58.472 --> 01:17:59.905
Kirby.

01:18:00.774 --> 01:18:03.834
- Hey.
- Hey, look, I just wanted to talk to you.

01:18:04.011 --> 01:18:07.674
- There's really nothing to talk about.
- Wait. Please, can I just explain?

01:18:08.048 --> 01:18:09.447
It's not that complicated.

01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:14.046
What you did was really not cool.

01:18:15.355 --> 01:18:17.186
It really hurt me.

01:18:17.558 --> 01:18:19.549
Kirby, I'm really sorry about
what happened.

01:18:20.027 --> 01:18:22.222
I didn't know how to handle it.

01:18:23.864 --> 01:18:26.924
But I think I do now
and that's why I'm here.

01:18:29.703 --> 01:18:32.934
My life right now, it's totally ruined.

01:18:33.106 --> 01:18:36.564
Okay? I practically burned down
my whole neighborhood.

01:18:37.211 --> 01:18:40.612
Probably bankrupt my parents.
I'll be in debt until I die.

01:18:40.781 --> 01:18:43.944
But the only thing that I care about
fixing right now is this.

01:18:44.117 --> 01:18:45.414
So, I'm sorry.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.545
If you're still mad, I get it...

01:18:49.756 --> 01:18:53.556
...but if you are talking to me
by my next birthday...

01:18:53.727 --> 01:18:56.662
...I'd really like to spend it with just you.

01:19:05.272 --> 01:19:06.762
Oh, you're...

01:19:13.814 --> 01:19:15.907
So we're cool again?

01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:18.449
I never said you were cool.

01:19:31.531 --> 01:19:35.126
So you know this high school party
in Pasadena that turned into a riot, right?

01:19:35.302 --> 01:19:38.465
The kid actually burned his parents'
house down. Can you imagi...?

01:19:38.639 --> 01:19:41.267
Do you know how many chores
it's gonna take to make up for...

01:19:42.943 --> 01:19:46.344
He'll be taking the trash out
nine times a day for the rest of his life.

01:19:46.546 --> 01:19:50.778
<i>The person who caused
the early morning fire and explosion here...</i>

01:19:50.951 --> 01:19:54.682
<i>...has survived his injuries...
Costa!</i>

01:19:54.855 --> 01:19:57.653
<i>We moved to a place like Pasadena
to avoid stuff like this.</i>

01:19:57.824 --> 01:20:00.918
<i>Some asshole puked all over
my front door.</i>

01:20:01.094 --> 01:20:05.155
<i>Do these kids even have parents?
It's ridiculous, right?</i>

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.630
Have you seen the footage?
Let me tell you.

01:20:08.802 --> 01:20:13.000
I haven't seen that many teenage boobs
since R. Kelly's birthday party.

01:21:00.554 --> 01:21:06.049
<i>Joining us now live is one Pasadena teen
who's recently drawn a lot of notice...</i>

01:21:06.226 --> 01:21:08.126
<i>...for throwing what people
are calling...</i>

01:21:08.295 --> 01:21:11.355
<i>...possibly the most epic
high-school party of all time.</i>

01:21:11.531 --> 01:21:15.399
<i>Costa, before we begin, is there anything
that you would like to say to the viewers?</i>

01:21:15.569 --> 01:21:16.729
<i>In fact, I would.</i>

01:21:16.903 --> 01:21:20.031
<i>You said it was perhaps
the most epic party of all time.</i>

01:21:20.207 --> 01:21:22.539
<i>It was the most epic party of all time.</i>

01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:26.201
<i>Okay. I was thinking more along
the lines of an apology.</i>

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.779
<i>Would you like to apologize?</i>

01:21:27.948 --> 01:21:30.974
<i>I got a better idea.
How about I invite you to my next party?</i>

01:21:31.451 --> 01:21:33.476
<i>- What?
- Yeah, you heard me, sugar-tits.</i>

01:21:33.653 --> 01:21:35.484
<i>Just make sure
you wear something tight.</i>
