00:06.965 --> 00:09.759
Man, we killed that
all-you-can-eat buffet.

00:09.843 --> 00:10.760
Yup.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.060
What? It says, "All you can eat."
I will eat all of it.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.061
This is on them.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.272
Oh, I'm with you.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.400
[laughs]

00:25.483 --> 00:27.110
What else you got in there?

00:29.154 --> 00:31.531
That's not what I...
Never mind. Don't answer.

00:31.948 --> 00:34.242
Hey, so, Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.286
We should do something, right?

00:37.037 --> 00:39.581
Look, I like flowers, chocolates,

00:39.664 --> 00:41.708
and a stupid teddy bear
I'm gonna throw in the trash

00:41.791 --> 00:43.460
as much as the next girl.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.421
But we've both been married before.
We know that Valentine's Day sucks.

00:46.504 --> 00:47.338
Let's just skip it.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.257
I have been married before.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.592
This smells like a trap.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.635
It's not a trap.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.887
My family is going out.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.472
I'm taking the day for myself,

00:55.555 --> 00:57.932
and you should do all the stuff
that you like to do.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.267
Whatever that is.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.811
-We don't know each other that well.
-[chuckles]

01:01.895 --> 01:03.063
Okay.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.024
Although, I was going use
the occasion to make my big move

01:06.107 --> 01:07.317
since we haven't kissed yet.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.402
No, no, don't talk about it.
What are you doing?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.530
Just making sure
that I'm safely out of the friend zone.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.449
You are out of the friend zone

01:14.532 --> 01:17.535
and you soon will have access
to other zones.

01:19.454 --> 01:21.247
-Okay, get out of here. Get out.
-[chuckles]

01:24.250 --> 01:25.126
[together] Bye.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.013

we have ever heard.

Let's get this bocce ball rolling.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.433
You're really this excited
about watching lawn bowling?

03:03.516 --> 03:06.144
I've been grounded for three weeks
with no phone or TV.

03:06.477 --> 03:09.063
Last week, I read a Jane Austen book...

03:09.314 --> 03:10.148
for fun.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.859
Yeah, remember you're still grounded,

03:12.942 --> 03:15.445
and the only reason I'm letting you go
is 'cause this seems worse.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.411
What do you think?

03:24.120 --> 03:26.998
I think I'm glad you two found each other.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.293
We are celebrating.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.170
This is our first Valentine's together,

03:32.253 --> 03:34.422
and my first time
acknowledging Valentine's

03:34.505 --> 03:37.342
since all the other years
I was at home making fun of it

03:37.425 --> 03:39.177
'cause, really, I was sad.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.972
Why does your head look like a butt?

03:47.852 --> 03:48.978
They're hearts.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.190
We are not doing
the typical corporate Valentine's Day.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.442
I have planned an amazing day of service.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.237
Syd and I are doing
the Heart Healthy fun run.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.989
Did you know that heart disease
is the number one killer of women?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.075
Second only to these dimples.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.621
Papito, you are
the number one lady killer. [chuckles]

04:07.372 --> 04:10.833
You are the lady serial killer.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.962
Okay, Mami, getting weird.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.549
Anyway, what we're doing is perfect.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.635
Yeah. What else are we gonna do?

04:20.718 --> 04:25.223
Have an amazing time at Benihana

Yeah, right.

Oh, good, you're all here.
Everybody, huddle up. I need advice.

Listen, I'm begging you. Make this quick.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.067

04:36.985 --> 04:40.029
-The Schneiders arrived in the New World.
-Quicker.

04:40.113 --> 04:44.075
We got rich, but I told Avery,
the girl that I'm dating, that I'm poor.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.370
So... how does that whole nightmare work?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.291
We're not poor, we're middle-class.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.501
Yeah, that's good.
Tell me other things poor people say.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.969
Just take her to your apartment.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.554
Then she'll know I'm rich.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.097
It's a shame, too,

05:06.180 --> 05:09.267
'cause I just installed a hot tub
and a high-tech Japanese toilet.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.477
When you flush, it says, "Arigato."

05:12.979 --> 05:14.397
Take her to the Burbank Airport,

05:14.480 --> 05:17.483
watch the planes take off
while eating Taco Bell drive-through.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.194
Get her cinnamon twists if you
want to go south of the border. Bye!

05:23.823 --> 05:25.700
Damn, now I want Taco Bell.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.289

Oh, God. It's so nice to see you.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.032
What are you two doing here?

06:06.115 --> 06:09.118
Well, there we were
at the Burbank Airport,

06:09.202 --> 06:10.578
watching planes and...

06:11.954 --> 06:13.498
eating chalupas.

06:15.041 --> 06:20.380
I believe it was Jenny from my block
who said, "Love don't cost a thing."

06:21.464 --> 06:22.924
It was so fun.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.051
Whenever a private plane
would fly over us,

06:25.134 --> 06:27.095
the pilot would wave at Schneider
like he knew him.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.392
I got one of those faces.

06:32.475 --> 06:37.188
Okay. Anyway, um, I'm kind of doing
an alone thing for Valentine's Day.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.690
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.652
It gets better.

06:43.486 --> 06:47.156
No. No, no, no. This...
It's by choice, obviously. I mean...

06:47.240 --> 06:49.325
Well, I usually dress better.
[chuckles]

06:49.409 --> 06:51.619
I'm sorry. We can...
we can totally head out.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.080
[stammering] It's just that... Hmm.

06:54.163 --> 06:58.960
I live in one of those tiny houses,
and my roommate wants to lie down.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.546
So...

07:02.130 --> 07:05.258
-And we don't feel like fighting the rain.
-What? Is it raining out there?

07:05.341 --> 07:08.177
Oh, yeah. It's coming down
like a waterfall in Bali.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.887
I imagine.

turned into the veijitas
wet T-shirt contest.

[groaning] No.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.442
It was so beautiful on the outside.

07:23.234 --> 07:24.861

07:26.237 --> 07:28.156
-Wait. Where's Mami?
-[groans]

07:35.246 --> 07:36.706

A horrible truth has been revealed.

07:42.170 --> 07:45.756
Papito, get me a straightening iron
and the Bible.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.261
Can't we just get an umbrella
and go back out there?

07:50.344 --> 07:51.512
Are you crazy?

07:52.889 --> 07:55.391
Everybody knows that going outside
with wet hair

07:55.475 --> 07:59.270
is almost as deadly as walking barefoot
in your own home.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.523
Ay, Mami, a little rain never hurt anyone.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.858

Don't be silly, Miss Alvarez.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.537
I don't have telekinetic powers...

08:17.246 --> 08:19.582
no matter how hard I try.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.711
The rain ruined the fun run.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.296
And all those hypocrites bailed,

08:25.379 --> 08:28.549
so Syd and I finished the whole thing,
just to prove a point.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.635
Yeah, you really showed them.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.304
You look ridiculous.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.265
Hmm. Look who's talking, Chia Pet.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.857
You know what's crazy?

08:44.941 --> 08:48.778
We ran right past Benihana.

08:49.403 --> 08:53.741
See all those people catching shrimp
in their mouths and laughing?

08:53.824 --> 08:55.826
Yeah, all of those people having fun.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.787
I am so glad we're beyond that.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.669
Oh, hello.

09:06.128 --> 09:08.798
I see there are more than six peoples
in our home.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.842
Well, that settles it.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.970
We must have a party.

09:15.054 --> 09:17.056
I will get my box of decorations.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.643
-Leslie, get the box of decorations.
-No, no. Guys, no!

09:20.726 --> 09:24.021
This is LA. Rain lasts only five minutes.
It's gonna clear up.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.107

09:26.983 --> 09:28.859
Ay, fine. We'll have a fun party.

Head Over Heels."

09:52.967 --> 09:54.302
Well, what are they?

09:56.053 --> 09:58.055
Ooh. This looks fun.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.557
Question one.

Uh...

10:08.441 --> 10:10.192
Have you ever seen Forrest Gump?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.320
-No.
-Oh.

10:12.403 --> 10:15.323
Well, in that case, let me tell you
something Mama always said.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.119
Wow, Mom, you clean up nice.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.121
Oh, thank you. You're still grounded.

10:23.205 --> 10:25.583
But I'll admit it's nice
to have an excuse to dress up.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.169
Come on. If you want
to get out of the apartment,

10:28.252 --> 10:30.338
help me find the champagne flutes
in the garage

10:30.421 --> 10:34.467
because we are having a party!

10:35.926 --> 10:37.053
You're having a party?

10:37.136 --> 10:38.638
We are having a party.

10:38.721 --> 10:43.643
[vocalizes mambo music]

10:47.063 --> 10:48.898
Nah, man, we ain't having no party.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.319
Okay. I was just going
to leave these at your door...

10:53.402 --> 10:55.154
No. Listen, don't be mad.

10:55.237 --> 10:59.367
I, really... I was supposed to be alone
having a romantic time with myself.

11:01.619 --> 11:03.329
Let me start that over.

11:03.412 --> 11:06.290
Uh, the rain ruined everything,
and everybody came back,

11:06.374 --> 11:08.501
and we're Cuban,
so now we're having a party.

11:08.584 --> 11:10.920
Well, I'm Colombian,
so I actually get that.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.464
Except with my mom, it's not...
[vocalizes mambo music]

11:14.548 --> 11:16.550
It's...
[vocalizes Colombian music]

11:18.135 --> 11:19.553
Do I hear a Colombian?

11:24.141 --> 11:25.685
Thank you for my flowers.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.061
You should stay.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.938
-But my socks are wet.
-You can take them off.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.483
Barefoot on a cold floor?
My Tío Paco died that way.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.568
They said it was the cancer,
but we all knew.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.781
Mami, you're gonna love him.

11:41.742 --> 11:42.785
Hey, Sam's dad.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.787
What's the news from the outside?

11:45.996 --> 11:47.665
Do they still have the Internet?

11:48.666 --> 11:49.834
Still grounded, huh?

11:50.751 --> 11:52.712
I'd kill for a cat video right now.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.841
Why don't you invite Sam over?

11:56.924 --> 11:59.301
Maybe being around someone his own age
will take the edge off.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.388
Oh, I would but he's spending
the night at his mother's.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.347
Maybe next time.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.475
We didn't have a dime to our name...

12:07.059 --> 12:08.978
but I needed those leg braces.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.734
So Mama marched up those stairs
and did what she had to.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.028
This was years
before I met the president.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.532
Wow, that is just...

12:21.615 --> 12:23.492
Can you believe this guy?

12:24.493 --> 12:25.703
I really can't.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.208
Hey, I'm so sorry
that our plans turned into this.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.878
But we can still do something
socially aware.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.714
Like, did they ever free Tibet?
We should check on that.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.676
Or we could just keep hanging out
at the party.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.430
I'm kind of curious to find out what
happened to Schneider's friend, Bubba.

12:46.015 --> 12:49.101
There's pineapple shrimp,
coconut shrimp...

12:51.145 --> 12:52.396
[Leslie sighs]

12:52.980 --> 12:55.357
Leslie, your breathing is so sad.

12:57.651 --> 12:58.694
Stop breathing.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.035
I'm sorry. This day gets in my head.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.954
My wife left me on Valentine's Day.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.374
[gasps]
Pobrecito.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.503
And the divorce papers arrived
on April Fool's.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.800
You can imagine the confusion.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.431
Wow! I was sad about my life
until just now.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.059
Thanks, Doc.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.353
Hey, Leslie,

13:32.436 --> 13:35.898
you cannot go through life
like there's a cloud over your head.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.026
[Lydia gasping]

13:41.111 --> 13:43.489
I am a bruja. I knew it.

13:45.574 --> 13:46.951
-Mom, there's a leak!
-What?

13:47.034 --> 13:48.536
All right. Don't worry, everybody.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.703
The super will fix it.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.457
Schneider, fix it!

13:53.541 --> 13:55.668
I'm on it!
Let me just go get my tool belt.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.545
Ooh. Is it in your apartment?

13:57.795 --> 14:02.675
No. It's next to the trash-can fire
I use to keep warm.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.722
Let's finish the questions.

14:08.806 --> 14:12.017
I thought of a lot more
dream vacation spots.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.687
Reno, the biggest little city
in the world.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.731
Can we please not?

14:17.815 --> 14:20.901
I'm so tired of looking at happy girls
in tampon ads.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.987
PMS is a thing and it's okay to feel it.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.575
Fine, let's just do
what you want to do, again.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.159
Hold on.

14:29.493 --> 14:30.578
What do you mean by that?

14:31.036 --> 14:34.081
You think everything I want to do
is stupid or a joke.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.583
When did I say that?

14:35.666 --> 14:38.961
Only the three times I said
I wanted to go to Benihana.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.629
I thought that was a stupid joke!

14:42.089 --> 14:43.132
Oh.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.719
I've been dropping hints left and right.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.263
Maybe you should pay
a little less attention to the world

14:49.346 --> 14:50.806
and a little more attention to me.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.058
Or maybe you should be
a little less passive-aggressive

14:53.142 --> 14:54.351
and just tell me what you want!

14:54.435 --> 14:56.186
Fine! I want to leave!

14:57.730 --> 15:01.400
But I can't because my dad
isn't picking me up for two hours.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.905
So instead, I want to find out
what color makes my eyes pop.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.448
[grunts]

15:08.574 --> 15:11.577
Great news, I made an important discovery.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.580
You guys don't live on the top floor.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.249
So this can't be rainwater.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.792
Oh.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.797
It got in my mouth.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.094
So, where is this water coming from?

15:29.178 --> 15:30.638
That's as far as I got.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.266
Well, let's ask the water
where it's coming from.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.480
Um, it's warm,

15:40.731 --> 15:44.193
and it smells like bergamot and hibiscus.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.277
[sniffs]

15:45.361 --> 15:48.030
Ooh. That's nice.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.866
It is your stupid hot tub!

15:52.159 --> 15:53.077
It's leaking.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.662
Wait. You have a hot tub?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.330
No.

15:56.413 --> 16:01.877
That would be crazy
for a simple boy from Alabama...

16:03.128 --> 16:04.713
Okay, I'm rich!

16:06.507 --> 16:08.801
Like, really rich. I own this building.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.762
I'm sorry I lied to you.

16:11.845 --> 16:15.641
I just thought you'd think less of me
if you knew I had a lot of money.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.688
[sighs] I don't...
I don't think less of you.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.779
What's happening?

16:30.739 --> 16:32.658
Is that a Dries Van Noten blouse?

16:32.992 --> 16:33.826
Yes.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.120
I'm rich too.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.003
But it's family money.
I didn't make it on purpose.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.964
No, no, no. I know that pain.

16:47.047 --> 16:51.093
You spend and you spend and you spend,
and there's always more.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.555
Oh, this is some bull.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.936
Look, I... I do have a tiny house.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.939
I just keep it in the ballroom
of my giant house.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.568
I just wanted you to like me.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.196
I just wanted you to like me.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.493
Leak!

17:16.577 --> 17:18.037
Right. Right.

17:19.663 --> 17:21.457
Let's go fix my hot tub.

17:22.624 --> 17:26.170
Or better yet,
let's pay someone else to do it.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.969
Oh! Que romántico! Whoo!

17:35.220 --> 17:37.222
Is it always like this over here?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.560
Come dance with me.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.645
[dance music plays]

17:49.443 --> 17:50.277
Hey.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.074
I just want to tell you that
I'm really glad you came over tonight.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.075
Me too.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.368
I feel very much at home here.

17:59.203 --> 18:03.791
My mom's crucifixes are a lot bloodier,
but same All-Star team of Popes.

18:06.251 --> 18:07.169
It's pretty great.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.757
[cellphone rings]

18:12.966 --> 18:14.301
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.260
My son.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.513
Everything okay?

18:19.056 --> 18:21.600
First, unload the dishwasher,
then PlayStation.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.769
All right. I'll see you when I get home.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.858
I thought you said Sam was with his mom.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.859
What?

18:32.653 --> 18:33.570
Oh.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.197
Right.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.241
You lied to me?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.370
Why don't want Sam to come over?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.123
Does he not know we're dating?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.208
Are you embarrassed of me?

18:46.667 --> 18:47.501
It's not you.

18:47.584 --> 18:48.836
It's Elena, isn't it?

18:48.919 --> 18:50.129
I know she's a lot.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.967
No, Elena is great.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.427
Alex?

19:01.431 --> 19:02.516
What's wrong with Alex?

19:06.061 --> 19:07.271
Sam's only 15.

19:08.397 --> 19:13.068
I just want to keep him away from
certain things for as long as possible.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.404
This is about the weed thing?

19:16.071 --> 19:20.367
Alex... made a mistake
like every teenager who's ever lived.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.451
He's a good kid.

19:21.535 --> 19:25.330
And if you haven't noticed,
he's being punished by a really on-it mom.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.666
Look, I'm not gonna apologize
for being overprotective,

19:27.749 --> 19:29.835
or as we Colombians call it, "Colombian."

19:29.918 --> 19:32.880
Oh, please. Cubans invented it.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.465
-You know what Colombians are known for?
-Don't you say it!

19:35.549 --> 19:37.426
We also have coffee and Shakira.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.013
Look...

19:41.889 --> 19:43.557
I did what I thought was right.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.269
I didn't even let him go
on sleepovers till he was 14.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.312
Fourteen?

19:48.854 --> 19:52.107
You let a baby sleep over
at a stranger's house?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.026
You call that overprotective?

19:54.484 --> 19:57.988
We didn't even have furniture
with corners on it until Alex was 12.

19:58.780 --> 20:01.533
My son's never been in a public pool!

20:01.617 --> 20:04.119
I make my kids wear flip-flops
in our own shower

20:04.203 --> 20:05.746
'cause I don't know where we've been.

20:07.497 --> 20:10.209
We are both very overprotective people!

20:10.292 --> 20:11.627
I guess so!

20:31.855 --> 20:34.149
-It's nice to be with someone who gets it.
-Right?

20:35.609 --> 20:37.319
I mean, it's not like we're crazy.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.655
No, everybody else is crazy
for not being like us.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.038
I can see what a great kid Alex is.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.335
And when his grounding is up, I'd like to
have him come over and hang with Sam.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.048
Have you tested your paint for lead?

21:03.470 --> 21:04.388
Of course.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.391
I tested your paint for lead.

21:10.644 --> 21:11.770
That is so hot.

21:17.526 --> 21:18.402
Hey.

21:19.069 --> 21:19.987
Hey.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.366
-Are you going to break up with me?
-What?

21:24.449 --> 21:27.119
No, I'm here to tell you
that green makes my eyes pop.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.872
I could have told you that.

21:37.045 --> 21:40.090
I'm really sorry that
I didn't take your ideas seriously.

21:40.173 --> 21:43.343
And I'm sorry I wasn't more direct
about what I wanted.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.639
Mmm. Our first fight. [chuckles]

21:47.723 --> 21:50.892
It was a real knock-down,
drag-out emotional brawl.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.688
How do you make sure
we never have one of those again?

21:54.980 --> 21:57.524
Just take me to Benihana.
How can I be clearer?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.695
Look.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.407
I love that you're woker
than a barnyard rooster.

22:06.908 --> 22:12.247
But... sometimes you just want to hang out
with your best gal at a restaurant

22:12.331 --> 22:13.999
that's not just a meal.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.584
It's an experience.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.420
I made you something.

22:20.339 --> 22:24.259
I... bailed on giving it to you 'cause
I thought it was kind of corny, but...

22:25.093 --> 22:25.927
Get it?

22:26.011 --> 22:29.348
It's binary code, zeros and ones,
except for the heart,

22:29.431 --> 22:31.308
which is all the other numbers.
So it's a--

22:31.391 --> 22:33.393
A non-binary heart!

22:34.686 --> 22:36.605
Oh, my God. I love you.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.485
I mean... I hope that's okay.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.445
But I do.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.739
Of course it's okay.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.033
I love you too.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.251
Sorry, we're such a cliché
saying I love you

22:58.335 --> 23:00.796
for the first time on Valentine's Day.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.631
I'm too happy to care.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.011
This is the best thing
anyone's ever gotten me.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.304
That is until we go--

23:09.388 --> 23:11.390
I get it! I'll take you to Benihana.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.565
The leak stopped.

23:21.650 --> 23:22.734
[gasps]

23:22.818 --> 23:25.028
Thank you, Schneider!

23:25.445 --> 23:27.030
Whoo! Ha-ha!

23:28.073 --> 23:29.282
Hey.

23:31.701 --> 23:32.702
Hey.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.082
Hey.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.293
Hey.

23:42.045 --> 23:42.963
Hey.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.092
Thought we'd come back to the party

23:47.175 --> 23:49.177
instead of heading
to some fancy restaurant.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.847
We're not too elite
to hang with the real peeps.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.515
Late reservation?

23:53.598 --> 23:55.142
10:30 was the earliest we could get.

23:57.894 --> 24:01.523
It's nice to have so many happy couples
under one roof.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.484
Yeah. I'm your classic ninth wheel.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.652
[babbles]

24:05.735 --> 24:06.611
Just for the record,

24:06.695 --> 24:08.655
Abuelita and I are not together.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.494
Leslie.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.998
I want to tell you something.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.127
Valentine's Day...

24:22.752 --> 24:24.754
was Berto's day to shine.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.883
Every detail was perfect.

24:28.508 --> 24:35.348
Every piece of chocolate,
every petal on every flower... impecable.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.351
But... after Berto,

24:39.102 --> 24:43.482
I knew that there was no way that I would
ever have a date with someone else

24:43.940 --> 24:45.442
on Valentine's Day.

24:46.651 --> 24:47.486
Because...

24:49.029 --> 24:51.031
it would dishonor his memory.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.075
I understand.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.953
But...
[inhales]

24:57.162 --> 25:01.666
...I figured if I spent the day
with my grandson,

25:02.125 --> 25:04.211
and we had a chaperone...

25:06.046 --> 25:07.088
that would be okay.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.218
Yeah?

25:14.554 --> 25:17.349
We should share a kiss.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.816
I'm going to eat this...

25:27.526 --> 25:29.361
even though I'm highly allergic.

25:32.697 --> 25:36.076
This isn't how I saw
Valentine's Day going. [chuckles]

25:36.535 --> 25:37.827
But I'm glad it happened.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.579
Salud.

25:40.163 --> 25:41.122
Salud.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.918
The rain has stopped,
things are finally starting to look up.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.254
[Penelope screams]

25:55.428 --> 25:58.765
I don't know how
but I'm sure this is my fault.

26:01.309 --> 26:03.687
I thought you said you fixed the hot tub!

26:03.770 --> 26:04.604
I did!

26:05.647 --> 26:08.066
Oh, my Japanese toilet!

26:11.027 --> 26:12.153
[automated voice]
Arigato.
