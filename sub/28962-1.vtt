00:36.308 --> 00:38.476
Drea, did you see that?

00:39.945 --> 00:41.812
'Drea!'

00:41.814 --> 00:43.379
What is it?

00:43.381 --> 00:45.581
I think
it was an alien spaceship.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.050
Don't be weird, Phillip.

00:47.052 --> 00:49.952
I'm not being weird.
Come down here and see.

00:49.954 --> 00:52.621
'It was headed
towards the park.'

00:52.623 --> 00:56.526
It was probably just like
a plane flying low or something.

00:56.528 --> 00:58.698
Oh, I think there may be two.

01:38.136 --> 01:40.071
What the?

02:44.969 --> 02:46.104
Hello?

04:27.472 --> 04:28.905
Drea!

04:28.907 --> 04:30.907
Turn that thing down right now.

04:42.753 --> 04:44.386
Uncle Lou.

04:44.388 --> 04:45.955
Hey, Phillip. Hi.

04:45.957 --> 04:48.323
Did the UFO pass by your office
last night?

04:48.325 --> 04:49.825
UFO?

04:49.827 --> 04:51.561
Unidentified Flying Object?

04:51.563 --> 04:54.998
Y-yeah, I-I know what UFO means.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.434
You do know
aliens don't exist, right?

04:57.436 --> 05:00.436
Yes, they do. And they're here.

05:00.438 --> 05:02.241
- Really?
- Yeah. Look.

05:04.741 --> 05:06.977
The UFO started on its way
to the park.

05:06.979 --> 05:09.212
Well, actually,
I think there's two of them.

05:09.214 --> 05:12.047
Two? What, two little green guys
or, uh, two ships?

05:12.049 --> 05:13.616
Were they butt-naked?

05:13.618 --> 05:15.719
Uh, you know, if they're
butt-naked, it's quite funny.

05:15.721 --> 05:18.821
I.. Phillip,
I'm just messing with you, man.

05:18.823 --> 05:21.726
Phillip, I'm just messing.
Phillip.

05:30.736 --> 05:32.402
Drea!

05:32.404 --> 05:34.770
Come on, you gotta keep
the music down in the mornings.

05:34.772 --> 05:37.106
- I mean, I work night shifts...
- Yup, got it.

05:37.108 --> 05:39.008
- Hey, what's wrong?
- Everything's fine.

05:39.010 --> 05:42.044
- I just gotta get to work.
- Drea..

05:45.150 --> 05:46.719
What's wrong?

05:48.020 --> 05:51.020
I thought I got into Leroy,
but I didn't, so..

05:51.022 --> 05:53.489
- Aw, geez.
- I got waitlisted again.

05:53.491 --> 05:55.357
So I thought this is it.

05:55.359 --> 05:57.393
But, nope, not happening, so..

05:57.395 --> 06:01.765
Hey. Who needs those
fancy colleges anyways, eh?

06:01.767 --> 06:03.965
I mean,
I-I didn't go to any college.

06:03.967 --> 06:06.802
Yeah. You always say that.

06:06.804 --> 06:09.205
You know,
I'm only trying to help you.

06:09.207 --> 06:11.407
- 'Sometimes you get so...'
- Please, Uncle Lewis.

06:11.409 --> 06:13.376
I'm not in the mood
to argue with you right now.

06:13.378 --> 06:15.010
I really gotta get to work.

06:15.012 --> 06:18.314
I'll try again next year,
it'll be fine. Please.

06:18.316 --> 06:21.885
Okay, before you go to work,
can I give you some advice?

06:21.887 --> 06:24.888
You can get
into any college you want.

06:24.890 --> 06:27.924
I know you wanna go to Leroy
'cause your mom went there.

06:27.926 --> 06:30.994
No. Nope, nope, that is not
the only reason I want...

06:30.996 --> 06:33.063
Let me finish, alright?

06:33.065 --> 06:35.868
Your mom was very smart,
you are very smart.

06:37.269 --> 06:38.967
And, you know, she was able
to get a scholarship

06:38.969 --> 06:40.236
to go to Leroy and you weren't.

06:40.238 --> 06:43.373
Sometimes
smart just is not enough.

06:43.375 --> 06:47.212
Sometimes it's like, you know,
people you know in the world.

06:49.714 --> 06:51.049
Right.

06:54.051 --> 06:56.287
Okay, well,
thanks for the pep talk.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.724
- You can drive safe.
- Thanks.

07:01.726 --> 07:02.926
Please move back, officer.

07:02.928 --> 07:04.960
I don't wanna roll over
your foot.

07:04.962 --> 07:07.729
- Step away from the car.
- Yeah. That.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.165
Whatever you guys say.

08:57.375 --> 08:59.042
Crites.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.878
'Hey,
where did you learn to do that?'

10:09.880 --> 10:11.980
Uh, I just, um

10:11.982 --> 10:14.617
just kinda figured it out,
I guess.

10:14.619 --> 10:17.720
Plus, we have the best blades
in the business.

10:17.722 --> 10:20.690
- Best blades, huh?
- Oh, and YouTube videos.

10:20.692 --> 10:23.859
Oh. You know,
I got my own YouTube channel.

10:23.861 --> 10:26.495
- Nice.
- OutdoorDougie.com.

10:26.497 --> 10:29.665
That's cool. I'll try
to check it out sometime.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.337
I just got some new merch
for my online store.

10:35.606 --> 10:36.906
OutdoorDougie stress ball.

10:39.343 --> 10:40.877
- Hey, Drea.
- Hey.

10:40.879 --> 10:42.512
I need you to deliver this.

10:42.514 --> 10:43.946
What happened to Kevin?

10:43.948 --> 10:46.349
He took off
with a delivery last night

10:46.351 --> 10:47.950
and I never heard from him.

10:47.952 --> 10:50.353
Sounds like Kevin.

10:50.355 --> 10:53.325
Hey, I thought you might enjoy
this delivery, Drea.

10:55.092 --> 10:57.225
It's your dream place.

10:57.227 --> 10:58.661
Yeah, where is that?

11:08.706 --> 11:10.142
Oh, boy.

11:11.076 --> 11:12.141
Drea!

11:12.143 --> 11:14.543
- Hi, Shawn.
- Wow!

11:14.545 --> 11:17.312
Uh, you're finally taking me up
on that personalized tour?

11:17.314 --> 11:19.715
We can get in a-any building
on campus you want.

11:19.717 --> 11:22.851
Oh, wow, I mean, I'd love to,
but I'm just here to make

11:22.853 --> 11:26.455
a delivery and then I gotta
head back to work, so, bummer.

11:26.457 --> 11:28.157
Yeah. Ha-ha.

11:28.159 --> 11:30.926
I don't have to sign in, do I?

11:30.928 --> 11:34.162
Oh. Um, uh, no, no, it's fine.

11:34.164 --> 11:35.665
Yeah. I know you. You..

11:35.667 --> 11:38.234
Oh, hey, did you, uh,
get a chance

11:38.236 --> 11:40.668
to listen to that cassette?

11:40.670 --> 11:42.672
Oh. Yes, I love it.

11:42.674 --> 11:45.106
Uh, uh, I don't know how
it's not in my player right now.

11:45.108 --> 11:47.244
That's crazy. I've been..

11:49.347 --> 11:50.615
Got it!

12:02.361 --> 12:04.561
Right?

12:04.563 --> 12:07.430
You, you're hittin' it.
You're really hittin' it.

12:07.432 --> 12:09.331
You're really hitting
those notes.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.133
I can't believe
you really love it. I mean..

12:11.135 --> 12:13.335
You know,
I wrote all those pieces myself.

12:13.337 --> 12:16.839
Wow! Yeah, it-it,
it is something.

12:16.841 --> 12:18.209
Do you wanna hear it live?

12:19.274 --> 12:21.176
- I'm sorry, what?
- Yeah!

12:21.178 --> 12:24.880
I always come prepared.

12:24.882 --> 12:26.416
Wow! Okay.

12:26.418 --> 12:28.984
You know, I'm, I'm good
with this one right here.

12:28.986 --> 12:31.620
I, I gotta go
drop this food off, though.

12:31.622 --> 12:34.422
Like, I don't wanna keep
the customer waiting, so..

12:34.424 --> 12:35.724
- Drive safe now, alright?
- Alright, thanks.

12:35.726 --> 12:37.158
- Have a great one.
- You, too.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.729
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:42.467 --> 12:44.403
Oh, my God.

13:01.952 --> 13:03.321
Hi, mommy.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.342
What is this?

13:25.110 --> 13:26.544
Hall?

13:27.212 --> 13:29.380
Leroy Hall?

13:31.182 --> 13:33.749
♪ Leroy University
we stand tall ♪

13:33.751 --> 13:36.185
♪ Leroy University
won't let fall ♪

13:36.187 --> 13:40.922
♪ There's no adversity that
we can't handle and that's ♪♪

13:40.924 --> 13:42.624
And that's the Leroy way.

13:42.626 --> 13:45.460
- Oh, my God.
- Ah, don't be embarrassed.

13:45.462 --> 13:48.433
That was a lovely rendition
of the "Leroy Fight Song."

13:49.433 --> 13:50.266
Oh..

13:50.268 --> 13:53.234
- Hello.
- Hey.

13:53.236 --> 13:56.940
- Hi. Okay, uh, sorry.
- Yeah.

13:56.942 --> 13:58.606
Uh, I have some sushi here for...

13:58.608 --> 14:00.409
- Gregory Sax.
- Yeah, that's you.

14:00.411 --> 14:02.043
I believe you're looking for me.

14:02.045 --> 14:05.114
- I've been looking for you.
- You take card, right?

14:05.116 --> 14:06.617
No.

14:07.718 --> 14:09.417
Okay. Cash?

14:09.419 --> 14:11.253
Mm-hmm, that's all we take.

14:11.255 --> 14:12.654
Okay, well,
then if you come with me

14:12.656 --> 14:14.255
I can get some cash from inside
and we can...

14:14.257 --> 14:16.325
I'd love to come with you.

14:16.327 --> 14:17.796
Okay. Just this way.

14:19.197 --> 14:21.363
You know, my mom actually
went to this school.

14:21.365 --> 14:22.864
- Really?
- Yeah, but..

14:22.866 --> 14:24.066
Only for one semester 'cause

14:24.068 --> 14:25.401
then she got pregnant with me.

14:25.403 --> 14:28.403
So I guess you can kinda say
I ruined her plans.

14:28.405 --> 14:31.542
Oh, come on. I'm sure
you didn't ruin anything.

14:35.779 --> 14:37.379
Yeah, I'm just messing.

14:37.381 --> 14:41.283
Well, she should come
back and finish up, though.

14:41.285 --> 14:44.987
I saw older people in a few
of my classes last year, so..

14:44.989 --> 14:46.221
She'll be fine.

14:46.223 --> 14:47.790
She died two years ago, so..

14:47.792 --> 14:49.358
- Oh, God.
- Oh, no, no, no.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.593
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- It's fine.

14:50.595 --> 14:52.027
I'm gonna go to school here
one day.

14:52.029 --> 14:54.964
It's just, I just got
my second rejection letter.

14:54.966 --> 14:58.334
But you know what they say,
third time's the charm.

14:58.336 --> 14:59.701
- Yeah, I bet it will be.
- Sorry.

14:59.703 --> 15:01.571
Uh, sorry, we got
a few more flights to go

15:01.573 --> 15:03.973
and then I'm sure somebody's
gonna have cash for you, so..

15:03.975 --> 15:05.574
Oh, yeah, for sure, no worries.

15:09.414 --> 15:11.480
Hey. What do you think, Mandy?

15:11.482 --> 15:14.182
Mm, yeah, looks good.

15:14.184 --> 15:16.320
You didn't even look at it.

15:19.423 --> 15:21.690
Wait, what is this font?

15:21.692 --> 15:24.426
- I thought you liked it.
- Hey, Mandy!

15:24.428 --> 15:26.963
You got any cash for, um..

15:26.965 --> 15:28.564
I'm sorry,
what was your name, again?

15:28.566 --> 15:32.033
- 'It's, uh..'
- Drea.

15:32.035 --> 15:35.037
Oh. What, you've ordered
from this place before or...

15:35.039 --> 15:38.242
- No.
- That'll be, uh, 16.40.

15:40.278 --> 15:41.844
Okay. Great.

15:41.846 --> 15:44.413
Well, you two can, um,
do your little..

15:44.415 --> 15:46.447
You do have cash on you, right?

15:46.449 --> 15:50.521
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Thank you.

15:51.356 --> 15:52.691
Yeah.

15:57.627 --> 16:01.229
Geez, I feel like I haven't
seen you in a long time.

16:01.231 --> 16:04.868
So I'm just gonna give a..

16:06.437 --> 16:08.470
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:08.472 --> 16:11.407
Well, you got into
our dream school and I didn't.

16:11.409 --> 16:14.409
So there's that.

16:14.411 --> 16:18.413
- Are you and, like..
- Oh, yeah. We're..

16:18.415 --> 16:20.716
- Oh. Cool.
- Yeah.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.017
Yeah, it's cool.

16:22.019 --> 16:26.022
Um, did you hear back about
your admissions for this year?

16:26.024 --> 16:29.224
Yeah, i-it's a no for me, again.

16:29.226 --> 16:31.661
- So..
- Well..

16:31.663 --> 16:33.229
The head
of the history department

16:33.231 --> 16:35.398
is looking to fill
a job position.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.133
You-you think getting a job here

16:37.135 --> 16:38.901
would really help me
with admissions?

16:38.903 --> 16:41.273
Yeah. Totally.

16:41.773 --> 16:42.907
Here.

16:44.107 --> 16:46.407
Her name is Professor Lacy.

16:46.409 --> 16:47.777
You'd have to start tomorrow,
though.

16:47.779 --> 16:49.545
That's perfect.
I'm off tomorrow. Let's..

16:49.547 --> 16:51.113
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

16:51.115 --> 16:52.848
Cool.

16:52.850 --> 16:55.149
I'll give her a call
and let her know

16:55.151 --> 16:57.019
that she'll see you tomorrow.

16:57.021 --> 17:01.824
Thanks, Mandy. This is really,
really, really nice of you.

17:01.826 --> 17:02.992
Oh, um..

17:02.994 --> 17:05.460
I appreciate it
more than you know, like..

17:05.462 --> 17:08.532
Yeah, the, um, uh,
the job, it's..

17:09.900 --> 17:12.901
Well, it's babysitting her kids.
It's..

17:12.903 --> 17:14.035
Babysitting?

17:14.037 --> 17:15.637
- Yeah, but Professor Lace...
- Yeah, no.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.704
I'm, I'm too old
to be babysitting.

17:17.707 --> 17:19.608
What, is this a joke?

17:19.611 --> 17:22.877
She's on
the board of admissions, though.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.984
She could seriously help you.
It's all about who you know.

17:28.051 --> 17:30.054
Thanks.

18:29.580 --> 18:33.116
'And we've Fred from New Jersey.
Fred, you're on the line.'

18:33.118 --> 18:35.716
'Uh, hey.
I'm a big fan of the show.'

18:35.718 --> 18:37.889
'Yeah, listen,
I-I-I've been getting..'

18:40.024 --> 18:42.127
Hey, kiddo. Time for bed.

18:50.734 --> 18:51.903
Hey.

18:53.236 --> 18:56.138
It's fine, I like this spot.

18:56.140 --> 18:59.641
I know,
but this is Uncle Lewis' favorite chair

18:59.643 --> 19:01.343
and I don't want him
yelling at me about it.

19:01.345 --> 19:04.413
So please, just go to your room.

19:04.415 --> 19:06.618
Can you get me mom's blanket?

19:09.821 --> 19:10.955
Yeah.

19:23.935 --> 19:25.870
'Goodnight, weirdo.'

20:23.093 --> 20:24.895
Oh. What is that?

20:26.429 --> 20:30.565
Oh, my! What is that?

20:34.371 --> 20:36.608
I can't believe I'm seeing this.

20:37.341 --> 20:39.340
Wow, amazing!

20:41.713 --> 20:44.015
Aren't you a beautiful bird?

20:44.849 --> 20:45.950
Ah..

20:47.985 --> 20:49.053
Oh.

21:00.931 --> 21:02.863
- 'Did you read this, um..'
- 'Mm?'

21:02.865 --> 21:06.036
- 'This thing here about, uh..'
- 'About what?'

21:10.006 --> 21:12.176
What the hell happened to you,
Bob?

21:13.744 --> 21:15.778
I don't wanna talk about it.

21:15.780 --> 21:19.548
No disrespect, Bob,
but you kind of stink.

21:19.550 --> 21:21.317
My apologies.

21:21.319 --> 21:22.618
I didn't have a napkin on me

21:22.620 --> 21:24.386
and I-I didn't wanna ruin
my uniform.

21:24.388 --> 21:27.222
On the plus side,
I read somewhere that, uh

21:27.224 --> 21:30.093
it's a sign of good luck
if a bird poops on you.

21:31.629 --> 21:34.329
- Really?
- That's what I read.

21:34.331 --> 21:35.600
Oh..

21:36.934 --> 21:39.868
Well, then, things are
looking up for me for a change.

21:39.870 --> 21:42.739
Still, you should shower.

21:44.275 --> 21:45.342
Copy that.

21:58.188 --> 22:01.758
Ooh, I wonder if that's
my little porcupine friend.

22:13.737 --> 22:15.340
Daryl?

22:18.508 --> 22:21.945
Daryl the porcupine, is that you
out there, little buddy?

22:27.484 --> 22:28.820
No, sir.

23:36.621 --> 23:38.453
What the hell is that?

23:38.455 --> 23:40.390
What the hell is that?

23:41.458 --> 23:43.692
Oh, my God!

23:51.067 --> 23:54.302
Well, guys, that was
my babysitting 101 video.

23:54.304 --> 23:58.173
Just remember, your main job
is to take care of those kids.

23:58.175 --> 24:00.841
So if you're constantly
anticipating potential problems

24:00.843 --> 24:02.377
you'll always be prepared.

24:02.379 --> 24:05.080
Please, don't forget to have fun
and subscribe to my channel.

24:05.082 --> 24:07.251
It's easy now. Got it.

24:15.159 --> 24:17.495
Come on, we gotta go. I am late.

24:20.430 --> 24:21.562
What?

24:21.564 --> 24:25.033
Oh. Sorry,
I was listening to a podcast.

24:25.035 --> 24:27.034
God. Was it about aliens again?

24:27.036 --> 24:28.403
Yeah. What if it was?

24:28.405 --> 24:31.372
Okay, loser,
well, please hurry up

24:31.374 --> 24:33.809
because I have to go babysit.
We discussed this.

24:33.811 --> 24:36.177
Yeah, but you agreed to babysit,
not me.

24:36.179 --> 24:39.214
Well, you know, the Lacys
do have a really big house.

24:39.216 --> 24:41.116
Maybe you could, like, bring
your telescope or whatever.

24:41.118 --> 24:43.985
'Or, you know, stay here,
listen to your podcast.'

24:43.987 --> 24:45.986
Wait. Lacy?

24:45.988 --> 24:48.890
- Like, like, Trissy Lacy?
- Yeah.

24:48.892 --> 24:50.859
You're-you're babysitting
Trissy Lacy.

24:50.861 --> 24:52.095
I am.

24:53.429 --> 24:57.064
Oh, my gosh. My-my hair,
is my hair messed up?

24:57.066 --> 24:58.800
Phillip,
will you please hurry up?

24:58.802 --> 25:01.337
Yeah, I know.

25:01.339 --> 25:03.304
- What's taking you so long?
- Nothing, nothing.

25:03.306 --> 25:04.907
Oh, my gosh.
Did you fix your hair?

25:04.909 --> 25:06.175
- Yes.
- You still got a little...

25:06.177 --> 25:07.509
- Don't. Don't touch it.
- Okay, fine, fine.

25:07.511 --> 25:09.043
- Thank you.
- What were you doing?

25:09.045 --> 25:10.646
Like, putting cologne on
in the car or something?

25:10.648 --> 25:12.414
Don't-don't worry about
what I was doing.

25:12.416 --> 25:15.984
Let me see. You look cool.

25:17.021 --> 25:18.719
The door's open.

25:18.721 --> 25:19.987
I love you.

25:19.989 --> 25:23.995
Be good
and do what Drea says, okay?

25:25.329 --> 25:27.227
- Hi, Drea.
- Hi, Professor Lacy.

25:27.229 --> 25:29.097
You're a lifesaver.
Thank you for babysitting.

25:29.099 --> 25:30.499
- 'On such short notice.'
- 'Yes, of course.'

25:30.501 --> 25:32.167
Okay,
so the low-down on my kids.

25:32.169 --> 25:34.469
Trissy, smart, but sometimes
too smart for her own good.

25:34.471 --> 25:37.038
So be prepared.
I gave Jake your number.

25:37.040 --> 25:40.175
He insists
on only communicating by text.

25:40.177 --> 25:42.744
I know, it's weird,
I was hoping it was just a phase

25:42.746 --> 25:44.079
but maybe that's just how

25:44.081 --> 25:45.813
the next generation
communicate, huh?

25:45.815 --> 25:47.782
Who knows?

25:48.819 --> 25:49.984
Okay, taxi's here, gotta go.

25:49.986 --> 25:52.156
Thank you again so much, Drea.

25:53.591 --> 25:55.193
Actually, I, um..

26:06.937 --> 26:08.438
Hi.

26:22.186 --> 26:24.355
Anybody know any good jokes?

26:26.523 --> 26:27.555
I've got one.

26:27.557 --> 26:30.625
What does sushi A
say to sushi B?

26:30.627 --> 26:31.926
Wasabi!

26:31.928 --> 26:34.364
Like, what's up, B? You know?

26:40.236 --> 26:44.140
Okay, um, uh,
anybody wanna play a card game?

26:45.075 --> 26:46.974
A card game?

26:46.976 --> 26:49.280
What is this, 1986?

26:50.213 --> 26:53.451
Yeah, what is this, 1986?

26:57.920 --> 27:01.324
Okay. No card games,
no jokes, um..

27:03.361 --> 27:06.061
How about we watch a movie?
Everybody loves movies, right?

27:06.063 --> 27:08.096
We could do a movie night,
order pizza.

27:08.098 --> 27:11.233
Do you like scary movies?
I love scary movies.

27:11.235 --> 27:13.437
No, they're too violent.

27:17.041 --> 27:18.376
Right.

27:29.519 --> 27:33.353
Oh, my God, Jake.
This meme is so funny.

27:33.355 --> 27:36.190
Ooh, another text coming in
from Jake.

27:36.192 --> 27:38.926
Oh. You wanna go to the park?

27:38.928 --> 27:40.462
That's a great idea!

27:40.464 --> 27:43.432
Actually, that idea
doesn't sound half bad.

27:43.434 --> 27:47.034
I mean, I can pack us a picnic.

27:47.036 --> 27:50.039
Nice. What do you think?
Picnic, yes?

27:50.041 --> 27:52.005
Well, yeah,
if, uh, Trissy wants to do that

27:52.007 --> 27:53.710
a picnic sounds great.

27:55.278 --> 27:57.611
Should we reconfirm here
with Jake?

27:57.613 --> 28:01.215
Yeah? Ah, blow it up?
No, put the pin back in.

28:01.217 --> 28:04.619
It's not time.
Okay. Let's do this.

28:10.628 --> 28:13.896
I can't believe all the
plant life we've seen so far.

28:13.898 --> 28:16.067
Can anyone else believe it?

28:17.633 --> 28:21.101
- No, I-I can't believe it.
- Me either.

28:21.103 --> 28:23.370
Jake, look! Cloudberries.

28:23.372 --> 28:25.340
They have very distinct lobes.

28:25.342 --> 28:27.510
Do you see the distinct lobes,
Jake?

28:30.046 --> 28:32.414
Licorice fern.

28:32.416 --> 28:35.149
Guys, come on, check this out!

28:35.151 --> 28:37.651
Wow, this cannot be real.

28:37.653 --> 28:39.222
Someone pinch me.

28:44.227 --> 28:46.764
She sure is, uh, talkative.

28:49.132 --> 28:51.736
Hey. What you thinking about?

28:52.669 --> 28:55.035
Nothing.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.173
You nervous
about talking to her?

28:58.208 --> 29:00.975
I don't know. I guess. I just..

29:00.977 --> 29:02.511
I just feel like an idiot
every time

29:02.513 --> 29:04.682
I think of something
to say to her.

29:05.881 --> 29:07.517
You're not an idiot.

29:08.619 --> 29:11.255
More of a moron, really.

29:12.622 --> 29:14.455
- Wow, thanks.
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

29:14.457 --> 29:16.593
Come on, don't be nervous.

29:26.636 --> 29:28.072
What was that?

29:32.075 --> 29:34.376
I think it's some wildlife.

29:34.378 --> 29:35.579
Come on.

29:37.046 --> 29:39.249
Hey, kids, wait up! Uh..

29:52.161 --> 29:53.730
What is that?

29:58.134 --> 30:01.638
I think it's some sort of animal
or something.

30:07.142 --> 30:09.577
Hey! Don't get too close
to that thing.

30:09.579 --> 30:13.184
Did you get your, you know,
rabies shot?

30:14.384 --> 30:16.516
We have our shots.

30:16.518 --> 30:19.390
- Don't worry so much.
- Okay..

30:22.926 --> 30:23.958
Hi.

30:27.063 --> 30:29.930
Aw.. She's so cute.

30:29.932 --> 30:32.167
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:32.169 --> 30:33.936
Here. Come take a look.

30:33.938 --> 30:35.206
Actu..

30:38.874 --> 30:40.210
See?

30:41.244 --> 30:44.178
What do you think it is?

30:44.180 --> 30:48.282
I don't really know, which
is kind of troubling to me.

30:48.284 --> 30:50.521
What if it was an alien?

30:54.457 --> 30:56.293
'That would be cool.'

30:58.861 --> 31:01.398
Wait-wait a second.
I think she's hurt.

31:03.999 --> 31:05.966
Drea, what do we do?

31:05.968 --> 31:08.302
Just leave it there.

31:08.304 --> 31:11.005
Leave it there?
We're not leaving her there.

31:11.007 --> 31:13.809
Okay, Trissy.
That's-that's a wild animal.

31:13.811 --> 31:15.475
You don't take
wild animals home.

31:15.477 --> 31:17.245
You don't know
where that thing has been.

31:17.247 --> 31:20.749
But she's cute, and-and
she really needs our help.

31:20.751 --> 31:22.984
C-come on, please.

31:22.986 --> 31:24.487
Please, Drea.

31:27.290 --> 31:29.891
Okay.

31:29.893 --> 31:32.426
You know what, actually, let's
take her to the park ranger.

31:32.428 --> 31:33.594
They'll know what to do with her

31:33.596 --> 31:35.362
and then maybe they can, like

31:35.364 --> 31:37.300
donate her to a zoo.

31:39.602 --> 31:41.804
Uh, be careful, guys. She'll..

31:47.777 --> 31:49.546
Okay. She's cute, right?

31:51.015 --> 31:52.414
Sure.

31:52.416 --> 31:54.552
'Come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.'

32:04.326 --> 32:08.330
Aunt Dee,
you still haven't told me

32:08.332 --> 32:10.165
how long
you're gonna be gone for.

32:10.167 --> 32:13.434
Oh, not too long, I don't think.

32:13.436 --> 32:15.669
'Which one needs
the insulin shot?'

32:15.671 --> 32:19.507
- Little Herrick.
- 'And which one's Herrick?'

32:19.509 --> 32:23.512
Wrote it all down for you,
and there's pictures.

32:23.514 --> 32:25.280
Okay.

32:25.282 --> 32:27.013
Oh, you need any help?
That looks heavy.

32:27.015 --> 32:29.917
Got it.

32:29.919 --> 32:33.253
Oh, if you don't hear from me
for a little while

32:33.255 --> 32:34.656
just know I'm okay.

32:34.658 --> 32:36.392
- 'Okay?'
- Okay.

32:37.393 --> 32:38.861
Bye, babies.

32:40.997 --> 32:42.999
Have fun with your friends.

32:48.438 --> 32:50.905
Here we go.

32:50.907 --> 32:52.474
Come on, guys.

32:52.476 --> 32:54.841
Oh, Phillip, how's she doing?

32:54.843 --> 32:56.144
Oh, um..

32:57.547 --> 33:01.183
Yeah, she-she seems fine,
I guess.

33:01.185 --> 33:03.484
Thanks for checking.
Come on, Jake!

33:03.486 --> 33:06.053
No, no problem.

33:15.265 --> 33:16.566
Hello?

33:20.169 --> 33:22.005
Maybe no one's here.

33:25.374 --> 33:28.011
Hello? Is anyone inside?

33:29.312 --> 33:31.512
Please,
we have an injured animal.

33:31.514 --> 33:34.815
'A really weird-looking animal
that we've never seen before.'

33:34.817 --> 33:37.953
'Someone, open the door!'

33:37.955 --> 33:40.120
'Can you help us out, please?'

34:07.816 --> 34:08.951
So weird.

34:10.085 --> 34:11.518
Hey, um, Phillip, is she okay?

34:11.521 --> 34:14.425
Is she doing something weird?

34:20.228 --> 34:23.263
Looks like she's
sniffing at something.

34:23.264 --> 34:24.664
Sniffing?

34:24.666 --> 34:27.300
Oh, she is not happy.

34:27.302 --> 34:29.504
Yeah, maybe we should just
take it to a vet or something.

34:32.242 --> 34:33.643
Alright.

35:13.215 --> 35:16.783
So Shawn is still giving you
these mix-tapes, huh?

35:16.785 --> 35:19.120
Hey, can you roll down
your window for a sec?

35:19.122 --> 35:20.657
Sure. Why?

35:25.061 --> 35:26.561
That's why.

35:26.563 --> 35:29.166
- That was rude.
- You like bagpipe music?

35:32.934 --> 35:35.870
'Hi, you've reached
the Clark County Veterinary Office.'

35:35.872 --> 35:39.407
'Our hours are 10 a.m. to
6 p.m., Monday through Friday'

35:39.409 --> 35:41.041
'10 a.m. to 2 p.m..'

35:41.043 --> 35:43.211
The vet is closed.

35:43.213 --> 35:45.979
Actually, we have
a first-aid kit at our place.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.952
What was that?

35:53.088 --> 35:54.457
Uh..

35:56.258 --> 35:58.626
I think there's something
under the car.

35:58.628 --> 36:00.760
Okay, how about
we lock the doors

36:00.762 --> 36:04.865
and, uh, we'll fix her up
at your place, okay?

36:04.867 --> 36:05.902
Hm.

36:25.555 --> 36:26.687
So, Trissy, I was thinking

36:26.689 --> 36:28.356
maybe after we get her

36:28.358 --> 36:30.224
all cleaned up and everything

36:30.226 --> 36:32.760
'and she's feeling better,
she could, I don't know'

36:32.762 --> 36:34.394
'we could let her out
in the backyard'

36:34.396 --> 36:36.497
or put her in a cage or..

36:36.499 --> 36:38.533
A cage?
We're not putting her in a cage.

36:38.535 --> 36:40.100
Yeah, but she's a wild animal.
I don't..

36:40.102 --> 36:42.704
'I don't wanna leave her
in your-your house'

36:42.706 --> 36:44.571
'and she, I don't know,
you could go to sleep'

36:44.573 --> 36:46.573
'and she tears up everything.
Like..'

36:46.575 --> 36:48.376
'I think we all want her here.'

37:03.093 --> 37:05.059
Okay.

38:15.030 --> 38:16.933
Hey, Jake. What's the matter?

38:18.668 --> 38:21.171
No signal.
Hold on, let me check.

38:22.472 --> 38:24.405
Yeah, I-I don't have
a signal either.

38:24.407 --> 38:25.742
Yeah.

38:31.247 --> 38:34.881
Okay. Whatever.
Let's get this over with.

38:34.883 --> 38:37.818
I don't think she's gonna like
that iodine very much.

38:37.820 --> 38:40.287
What if she, like, freaks out
and bites one of us?

38:40.289 --> 38:42.490
- She's not going to.
- 'Maybe Phillip's right.'

38:42.492 --> 38:45.195
I mean,
those teeth do look sharp.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.032
Actually,
can you two hold her down

38:52.034 --> 38:55.236
and I guess I'll do the honors?

38:55.238 --> 38:57.006
Yeah. Okay, girl.

38:59.441 --> 39:01.142
Okay, okay, okay.

39:12.555 --> 39:13.757
Mm..

39:15.425 --> 39:16.457
Be careful, Drea.

39:17.760 --> 39:18.825
Phillip,
why would you do that?

39:18.827 --> 39:21.963
You're making me nervous. Stop.

39:21.965 --> 39:24.133
Okay, let's try this again.

39:25.602 --> 39:28.271
Please don't bite me.

39:33.742 --> 39:35.746
Oh, thank God.

39:38.648 --> 39:40.983
You're a tough little girl,
aren't you?

39:42.651 --> 39:45.419
- Alright.
- We should name her.

39:45.421 --> 39:48.990
How about Snowball?

39:48.992 --> 39:50.825
- That's not very original.
- Yeah.

39:50.827 --> 39:54.262
Okay, well,
let's see what you come up with.

39:54.264 --> 39:57.198
What about Bianca?

39:57.200 --> 39:59.533
- I like that.
- Yeah.

39:59.535 --> 40:01.135
Bianca it is, then.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.970
Alright, let me get my phone
so we can take a picture

40:02.972 --> 40:04.104
with us and Bianca.

40:04.106 --> 40:06.242
- Okay, hurry up.
- Mm-hmm.

40:07.644 --> 40:10.311
- I think she likes it.
- 'Yeah.'

40:49.452 --> 40:51.388
Is that another one?

41:01.396 --> 41:02.729
Look, look, look, look.

41:02.731 --> 41:05.100
There's, uh, there's, uh,
there's something in your trunk.

41:05.102 --> 41:07.838
Uh, it's blurry,
but I-I think it's an alien.

41:17.146 --> 41:18.380
Jake?

41:50.280 --> 41:51.481
Jake?

42:07.664 --> 42:10.631
You scared me.

42:10.633 --> 42:13.434
Do you wanna come in here
with us? We named her B..

42:15.537 --> 42:17.771
'Oh, my God. What is that?'

42:24.613 --> 42:26.981
- Wait, wait, we forgot Bianca.
- What? Are you kidding me?

42:26.983 --> 42:28.983
That thing just tried to rip
your brother's foot off.

42:28.985 --> 42:31.050
Are you okay?

42:31.052 --> 42:33.354
He's fine. We have to get her.

42:33.356 --> 42:36.090
Uh, yeah, no.
What if she tries to eat us?

42:36.092 --> 42:38.260
She's clearly not gonna eat us.

42:39.662 --> 42:41.097
She loves us.

42:43.164 --> 42:45.198
Here, Phillip,
take my key, go to the car

42:45.200 --> 42:47.234
lock the door behind you.
Go, go, go.

42:47.236 --> 42:48.635
I'll be back in a, in a second.

42:48.637 --> 42:49.671
'Oh, and, Drea.'

42:49.673 --> 42:51.608
'Grab the iodine for Jake!'

43:30.146 --> 43:31.981
Hey..

43:33.448 --> 43:35.783
Hey, Bianca.

43:39.990 --> 43:41.655
You didn't do that, did you?

43:44.427 --> 43:48.162
Um, well, girl,
you made some fans

43:48.164 --> 43:50.396
so I'm gonna just
put you in this bag

43:50.398 --> 43:53.100
and you're gonna go
with us, okay?

43:53.102 --> 43:55.570
Little road trip, yeah?

43:55.572 --> 43:57.604
'You're so cute.'

43:57.606 --> 43:59.840
Love your highlights, it's..

43:59.842 --> 44:01.510
Please don't kill me.

44:03.878 --> 44:05.611
Who's that, Phillip?

44:05.613 --> 44:06.946
Huh?

44:06.948 --> 44:10.584
Oh, that's our mom.

44:10.586 --> 44:13.088
Those are the Leroy steps,
right?

44:15.858 --> 44:18.028
So what's she doing now?

44:21.497 --> 44:25.402
She, uh, she died
in a car accident.

44:27.269 --> 44:30.104
Drea thinks it's her fault.

44:30.106 --> 44:31.439
She snuck out to a party

44:31.441 --> 44:34.675
and, well, mom wanted to go pi..

44:39.849 --> 44:41.149
- Let's go.
- Uh..

44:41.151 --> 44:45.151
I have one Bianca,
one first-aid kit.

44:49.092 --> 44:51.725
Professor Lacy's
gonna need a cleaner.

44:51.727 --> 44:53.697
- What?
- What?

44:55.398 --> 44:58.198
Nothing.
Keys, keys, where are my keys?

44:58.200 --> 45:00.033
- What did you do with my keys?
- Right there.

45:00.035 --> 45:02.135
Sorry.

45:08.077 --> 45:09.175
Oh, my God.

45:09.177 --> 45:11.611
- What?
- What?

45:11.613 --> 45:15.251
Just give me a second,
just let me check one thing.

45:26.162 --> 45:28.863
We're gonna have to walk.

45:28.865 --> 45:31.231
Walk? Walk where?

45:31.233 --> 45:33.133
To Uncle Lewis.

46:03.999 --> 46:06.136
Hello, your highness.

46:46.742 --> 46:48.475
Uncle Lewis?

46:48.477 --> 46:51.178
Uncle Lewis? Uncle Lewis?

46:51.180 --> 46:53.082
Drea, what's going on?

46:54.015 --> 46:56.082
Hey, Phillip.

46:56.084 --> 46:57.850
Huh, what's wrong
with your friend?

46:57.852 --> 47:00.086
He got bit by an alien.

47:00.088 --> 47:01.988
- An alien?
- Yeah.

47:01.990 --> 47:05.094
Are you okay, son? Huh?

47:06.628 --> 47:08.695
What's your name?

47:10.398 --> 47:12.399
Kid's a mute, right?

47:12.401 --> 47:14.702
Um, not necessarily,
he's just..

47:14.704 --> 47:16.870
Listen, I'd just, uh,
like to take a look at that...

47:16.872 --> 47:18.472
Yeah, no, no, no,
don't worry about it, we already

47:18.474 --> 47:20.374
cleaned it up
with iodine back at the house.

47:20.376 --> 47:21.908
What is going on? Phillip..

47:21.910 --> 47:23.843
Have you got these people
on some wild alien chase?

47:23.845 --> 47:26.912
Phillip,
just show him your phone.

47:26.914 --> 47:29.119
Look.

47:30.718 --> 47:32.586
Thank you.
Think I'll keep that. Drea...

47:32.588 --> 47:34.120
You didn't even look
at the picture.

47:34.122 --> 47:37.524
No, no, Drea.
Just come to the office.

47:37.526 --> 47:39.662
- A minute.
- Huh. Great.

47:42.298 --> 47:45.164
Drea, you cannot bring
those kids into this office

47:45.166 --> 47:47.167
talking all that nonsense.

47:47.169 --> 47:48.734
You want me to help that kid,
I'll help him.

47:48.736 --> 47:50.570
But otherwise,
what is he trying to prove?

47:50.572 --> 47:53.606
I'm trying to tell you that
something attacked Jake, okay?

47:53.608 --> 47:55.575
Something chewed its way
through my car.

47:55.577 --> 47:58.144
I had to walk here
from Professor Lacy's house!

47:58.146 --> 48:00.280
- You walked here?
- Yes!

48:00.282 --> 48:02.448
Well, what did you walk here
to say?

48:02.450 --> 48:05.387
That aliens are real!

48:08.957 --> 48:10.390
Come on, Drea.

48:10.392 --> 48:12.158
I understand Phillip.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.327
He's a kid,
he's got imagination.

48:14.329 --> 48:15.896
You know? It's okay.

48:15.898 --> 48:17.298
But you, I don't understand.

48:17.300 --> 48:18.631
- You're too old for this.
- No.

48:18.633 --> 48:20.434
We have one in Trissy's bag,
if you would just

48:20.436 --> 48:21.734
go out there and look at it

48:21.736 --> 48:24.805
it's a good one, I think, but..

48:24.807 --> 48:28.508
Drea, I don't have time
for this. Well, man, you, uh..

48:28.510 --> 48:29.977
I got a lot of things
on my mind, you know?

48:29.979 --> 48:32.948
I got a lot of things to do.
I don't have time.

48:34.383 --> 48:35.818
I see you do.

48:37.253 --> 48:41.821
Hey, kids,
we're just gonna go see Chef.

48:41.823 --> 48:44.226
I'm sure
he'll be able to help us.

50:19.320 --> 50:20.887
Dumbass.

50:29.097 --> 50:30.965
Thank you.

50:30.967 --> 50:32.365
Please come again.

50:32.367 --> 50:34.702
Uh, excuse me, Lan.

50:34.704 --> 50:36.870
Have you seen my nephew, Kevin?

50:36.872 --> 50:38.439
No.

50:38.441 --> 50:40.807
Chef. Chef.

50:40.809 --> 50:43.345
Hey, Drea. How's babysitting?

50:44.146 --> 50:47.079
Uh... it's goin' great.

50:47.081 --> 50:49.048
Listen, I need to talk to you
about something

50:49.050 --> 50:52.818
and you have to promise
that you'll take me seriously.

50:52.820 --> 50:55.655
And also, we need your van,
'cause we gotta get out of town.

50:55.657 --> 50:58.026
Wait a minute.
What is this all about?

51:00.329 --> 51:02.465
Can you show him the..

51:12.240 --> 51:13.606
- Oh!
- No. No, no, no.

51:13.608 --> 51:15.142
It's-it's okay. It's okay.

51:15.144 --> 51:18.845
'But we seriously need to take
your van.'

52:17.874 --> 52:18.941
Okay.

53:00.347 --> 53:01.948
What the hell is that?

53:24.639 --> 53:27.642
Ah..

54:10.751 --> 54:13.253
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.

54:13.255 --> 54:15.090
What is going on?

54:45.454 --> 54:47.990
No.. No.

54:49.224 --> 54:50.325
No.

55:19.088 --> 55:23.055
So you're telling me
there are a bunch of evil aliens

55:23.057 --> 55:27.162
and this one sitting here
is good?

55:28.863 --> 55:31.597
'Well, how do you know
he's good?'

55:31.599 --> 55:34.068
She saved us from a bad one.

55:34.070 --> 55:35.269
It's a she?

55:36.338 --> 55:37.803
Sorry.

55:37.805 --> 55:40.640
So, what's the plan?

55:40.642 --> 55:42.408
Where are you gonna go?

55:42.410 --> 55:44.744
State police.

55:44.746 --> 55:46.512
That's quite a drive.

55:46.514 --> 55:49.816
And that van is pretty beat
to you-know-what.

55:49.818 --> 55:53.153
I know,
but we have to try something.

55:53.155 --> 55:57.423
Wait a second. My mom has
a satellite phone in her office.

55:57.425 --> 55:59.258
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:59.260 --> 56:02.796
She uses it to communicate
with her researchers.

56:02.798 --> 56:05.032
I totally forgot about it.

56:05.034 --> 56:06.899
Well there you have it,
we'll just use that phone

56:06.901 --> 56:09.401
to call for help,
and Leroy's not too far away

56:09.403 --> 56:10.838
so that's perfect.

56:15.577 --> 56:17.013
What the?

56:25.053 --> 56:26.620
'Uncle Lewis?'

56:26.622 --> 56:28.057
He's here?

56:35.863 --> 56:37.863
'I have to go out there.'

56:37.865 --> 56:40.769
Just lock the door behind me
and watch the kids, okay?

56:41.802 --> 56:43.371
I'll be back.

56:52.447 --> 56:54.150
No! No! No!

57:02.557 --> 57:05.258
That is gross.

57:10.331 --> 57:12.333
Kevin's sneaker.

57:20.474 --> 57:23.041
Hey. You okay?

57:23.043 --> 57:24.477
You can drive, can't you?

57:24.479 --> 57:26.948
- I'm 12.
- Exactly.

57:27.682 --> 57:29.852
Go. Get out of here.

57:31.919 --> 57:33.787
But what are you gonna do?

57:33.789 --> 57:36.025
I know they killed my nephew.

57:40.428 --> 57:42.497
I'm gonna make them pay.

57:47.468 --> 57:49.436
Uncle Lewis?

57:49.438 --> 57:50.704
Uncle Lewis, what happened?

57:50.706 --> 57:53.939
Drea, listen to me.

57:53.941 --> 57:57.542
Sound. They can't take it.

57:57.544 --> 57:59.445
It'd kill them.

57:59.447 --> 58:02.916
Loud, high-pitched sound.

58:02.918 --> 58:04.651
You understand me?

58:04.653 --> 58:06.756
Okay. Um..

58:07.923 --> 58:09.957
We gotta get you to a hospital.

58:09.959 --> 58:11.527
There's no time.

58:19.968 --> 58:23.135
Your mother called me
that night.

58:23.137 --> 58:26.107
She asked me to go and get you
at your friend's party.

58:29.410 --> 58:31.843
I was in a bar.

58:31.845 --> 58:34.082
That's why she came to get you.

58:36.617 --> 58:38.353
It should've been me.

58:40.655 --> 58:44.425
Drea, I know you blame yourself
for your mom, but it's not you.

58:46.528 --> 58:48.861
It's not your fault.

58:48.863 --> 58:52.731
It's okay, Uncle Lewis.
I forgive you, okay?

58:52.733 --> 58:55.434
I-I just, I just gotta get
Chef's truck

58:55.436 --> 58:58.173
and I, and I, and I gotta get
the kids and then..

59:00.207 --> 59:02.410
You hear me, Uncle Lewis?

59:03.445 --> 59:05.247
Uncle Lewis!

59:17.459 --> 59:18.828
You bastards.

59:20.095 --> 59:21.861
Drea, we have the keys!

59:56.432 --> 59:57.566
Move, move!

01:00:01.936 --> 01:00:04.169
- Where's Chef?
- Not coming.

01:00:04.171 --> 01:00:05.537
- Okay.
- What about Uncle Lewis?

01:00:05.539 --> 01:00:08.642
He okay? Drea?

01:00:08.644 --> 01:00:11.010
Um, remember something for me.

01:00:11.012 --> 01:00:12.278
- What?
- High pitched-sounds.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.881
They hate high-pitched sounds,
okay?

01:00:19.186 --> 01:00:20.921
Hey! Wait. Get up, get up!

01:00:30.865 --> 01:00:34.934
Taste my steel,
you rat bastards.

01:00:34.936 --> 01:00:38.571
I have the best blades
in the business.

01:00:38.573 --> 01:00:40.142
Hyah!

01:00:44.412 --> 01:00:46.012
You want some?

01:00:46.014 --> 01:00:47.981
'Huh? Huh?'

01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:32.425
Never there when I need him.

01:01:32.427 --> 01:01:34.561
- Who? Shawn?
- Yes.

01:01:34.563 --> 01:01:36.729
Shawn has the keys
to every building on campus.

01:01:36.731 --> 01:01:40.832
We find Shawn, we get the keys,
we get to the satellite phone.

01:01:40.834 --> 01:01:43.972
- But Shawn is not here.
- Nope.

01:01:51.012 --> 01:01:52.211
I-I hear him.

01:01:52.213 --> 01:01:54.080
I-I-I-I hear him.

01:01:54.082 --> 01:01:55.580
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Um..

01:01:55.582 --> 01:01:57.416
Everybody out of the car.
Let's..

01:01:57.418 --> 01:01:58.386
Okay.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.954
Quickly, please.

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:05.524
Hey, Jake, you okay?
Good to walk?

01:02:05.526 --> 01:02:08.063
Well, at least
he's playing a lot better.

01:02:10.765 --> 01:02:12.267
Hey, Shawn?

01:02:13.302 --> 01:02:14.436
Shaw..

01:02:16.938 --> 01:02:18.338
Shawn?

01:02:22.577 --> 01:02:24.109
Oh, my God.

01:02:24.111 --> 01:02:26.245
Guys, um, Shawn is busy.

01:02:26.247 --> 01:02:29.481
Run, run.
Don't look back, just run.

01:02:29.483 --> 01:02:31.885
'Keep running! Keep.. Trissy?'

01:02:31.887 --> 01:02:34.019
'You're lagging behind,
come on!'

01:02:43.331 --> 01:02:45.564
How did they get here so fast?

01:02:45.566 --> 01:02:48.066
I don't know. Just, please,
just give me a second to think.

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:49.436
This is hopeless.

01:02:49.438 --> 01:02:52.240
They-they must have spread
all across town by now.

01:02:55.343 --> 01:02:57.542
Guys.

01:02:57.544 --> 01:03:00.481
I think they keep finding us
because of Bianca.

01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:07.055
Jake, did you
just say something?

01:03:09.624 --> 01:03:11.791
You know, you got a deep-ass
voice for a nine-year-old.

01:03:11.793 --> 01:03:14.660
Wait, wait a second.
You think they're after her?

01:03:14.662 --> 01:03:18.129
Yeah.
I think they can smell her.

01:03:19.767 --> 01:03:21.934
Okay. You know what?
We can't stay here.

01:03:21.936 --> 01:03:24.736
Let's um.. Mandy and Gregory.

01:03:24.738 --> 01:03:28.642
Let's go see if they have keys
to your mom's office.

01:03:28.644 --> 01:03:32.546
- Well, what about this gate?
- What gate?

01:03:35.784 --> 01:03:38.050
'Mandy!'

01:03:38.052 --> 01:03:40.787
'Gregory!'

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:43.088
Is anyone there?
Please let us in. Hello?

01:03:45.093 --> 01:03:49.262
Mandy! Oh, Mandy, Mandy, hi. Hi!

01:03:49.264 --> 01:03:51.865
It's an emergency.
Please open, please..

01:03:51.867 --> 01:03:53.999
- Thank you.
- Okay, go, go!

01:03:56.671 --> 01:04:00.907
Mandy, there are, there are
creatures, monsters outside

01:04:00.909 --> 01:04:04.244
from outer space,
and they're trying to kill us.

01:04:04.246 --> 01:04:06.879
I'm sorry,
did you just say monsters?

01:04:06.881 --> 01:04:08.814
- Yes.
- Drea.

01:04:08.816 --> 01:04:12.419
Don't screw up this gig
with some elaborate prank.

01:04:12.421 --> 01:04:14.320
These kids should
probably be in bed by now.

01:04:14.322 --> 01:04:15.754
No, this is,
this is not a prank.

01:04:15.756 --> 01:04:18.057
This-this is serious.

01:04:18.059 --> 01:04:22.461
Listen, I know that this isn't
the campus job that you wanted

01:04:22.463 --> 01:04:24.129
but I really was doing you
a favor.

01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:26.164
Okay, well,
you know what, bitch?

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.602
Do me a favor and don't do me
anymore favors, okay?

01:04:28.604 --> 01:04:30.736
- We need help!
- Oh, okay.

01:04:30.738 --> 01:04:33.039
Yeah, because you were doing
perfectly fine on your own

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:35.006
getting into the school?

01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:36.811
You know what, Mandy?

01:04:41.115 --> 01:04:42.751
Eat shit.

01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:45.385
Yeah, real mature.

01:04:45.387 --> 01:04:46.885
No, you know what's real mature?

01:04:46.887 --> 01:04:48.722
You not answering
your best friend's calls

01:04:48.724 --> 01:04:51.122
once you got accepted
into this fancy-ass college.

01:04:51.124 --> 01:04:52.524
That's what's real mature.

01:04:52.526 --> 01:04:56.028
Okay, I'm sorry, but... yeah.

01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.430
No. I'm-I'm not doing this
right now.

01:04:58.432 --> 01:04:59.466
Okay.

01:04:59.468 --> 01:05:02.271
But good luck with your aliens.

01:05:04.972 --> 01:05:08.073
So, uh, what is going on

01:05:08.075 --> 01:05:09.843
and why are you back here?

01:05:09.845 --> 01:05:11.010
Okay, so listen.

01:05:11.012 --> 01:05:13.312
We need the keys
to the history department.

01:05:13.314 --> 01:05:14.981
My mom has a satellite phone
in her office

01:05:14.983 --> 01:05:16.316
and we need to call for help.

01:05:16.318 --> 01:05:17.582
Okay, I don't have the keys

01:05:17.584 --> 01:05:18.852
to the history department.

01:05:18.854 --> 01:05:20.285
Just to the great hall
that we're decorating

01:05:20.287 --> 01:05:21.486
for the freshmen.

01:05:21.488 --> 01:05:24.457
Ugh! Okay. New plan.

01:05:24.459 --> 01:05:28.260
We have to, uh, go back
to the security shed

01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:29.394
and-and get Shawn's keys.

01:05:29.396 --> 01:05:32.097
Oh, no, no,
I do not love that plan.

01:05:32.099 --> 01:05:33.966
Okay, hold on just a second.

01:05:33.968 --> 01:05:37.836
If that's all you need to do,
then, I mean, I can do that.

01:05:37.838 --> 01:05:40.106
- Uh, it's kind of complicated.
- No, it's gonna be fine.

01:05:40.108 --> 01:05:41.841
- It's fine.
- No. Uh..

01:05:41.843 --> 01:05:43.575
What are you doing, bro?

01:05:43.577 --> 01:05:47.546
Listen,
I don't believe in monsters.

01:05:47.548 --> 01:05:50.283
But I do believe in one thing.

01:05:50.285 --> 01:05:53.251
- Oh, uh..
- I can run incredibly fast.

01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:54.820
Okay, but you don't understand.

01:05:54.822 --> 01:05:57.856
- Shawn was actually just...
- Shh!

01:05:57.858 --> 01:06:01.227
I took States
in the 800 and 1600 last year.

01:06:01.229 --> 01:06:02.928
I'll go get those keys

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:06.099
and then I'll be back here
in 2.7 minutes.

01:06:06.101 --> 01:06:07.633
- Don't miss me.
- Wait.

01:06:07.635 --> 01:06:09.401
But-but you-you really need
to be careful

01:06:09.403 --> 01:06:11.704
because I-I was trying
to tell you that..

01:06:12.573 --> 01:06:14.240
...Shawn was actually killed.

01:06:14.242 --> 01:06:15.908
Dammit! Come on!

01:06:22.718 --> 01:06:23.852
Whoo!

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.754
Yeah!

01:06:33.561 --> 01:06:35.827
What's that sound?

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:37.298
I don't know.

01:06:39.834 --> 01:06:40.969
Oh!

01:06:44.805 --> 01:06:46.238
Oh..

01:07:08.428 --> 01:07:09.794
We gotta get
to your mom's office.

01:07:09.796 --> 01:07:11.463
We gotta get
to your mom's office.

01:07:11.465 --> 01:07:12.731
I'm sorry you had to see that.

01:07:12.733 --> 01:07:14.566
Come on, come on, we gotta get

01:07:14.568 --> 01:07:16.269
to your mom's office.

01:07:23.577 --> 01:07:26.412
We're all gonna die tonight.

01:07:26.414 --> 01:07:27.579
Aren't we?

01:07:27.581 --> 01:07:29.682
No. No one's dying.

01:07:29.684 --> 01:07:33.119
But a huge ball of those things
just devoured Greg.

01:07:33.121 --> 01:07:36.823
- Yeah, well, we're not Greg.
- Yeah, but..

01:07:36.825 --> 01:07:40.459
But nothing.
No one's dying tonight.

01:07:40.461 --> 01:07:43.064
- You know why?
- Why?

01:07:44.965 --> 01:07:47.466
Because..

01:07:47.468 --> 01:07:49.434
...no one's coming to save us

01:07:49.436 --> 01:07:51.504
and we need to stop thinking
that someone will

01:07:51.506 --> 01:07:53.642
because it's not happening.

01:07:57.811 --> 01:07:59.445
You're not making us feel
any better.

01:07:59.447 --> 01:08:01.048
No, you're not.

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:06.452
My point is,
we don't need saving.

01:08:06.454 --> 01:08:08.454
We don't need some fancy-ass

01:08:08.456 --> 01:08:11.090
Leroy University students
to help us.

01:08:11.092 --> 01:08:15.227
We don't need Uncle Lewis
and we don't need Chef.

01:08:15.229 --> 01:08:16.962
We don't need anyone.

01:08:16.965 --> 01:08:18.633
Just each other.

01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:21.399
Okay?

01:08:23.937 --> 01:08:25.506
C-come on.

01:08:28.509 --> 01:08:31.109
No one else is dying tonight.

01:08:31.112 --> 01:08:33.412
I promise.

01:08:33.415 --> 01:08:34.712
And if anyone's dying,
it's gonna be

01:08:34.715 --> 01:08:37.017
one of those little turds,
you feel me?

01:08:39.687 --> 01:08:42.754
Now let's find
your mom's office.

01:08:42.756 --> 01:08:45.358
I don't care if we have
to kick down her damn door.

01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:35.506
Guys, i-it's a keypad.

01:09:35.509 --> 01:09:37.408
We can't get through
without a password.

01:09:37.411 --> 01:09:38.577
Okay, well, try something.

01:09:38.578 --> 01:09:41.412
I mean,
how many numbers could it be?

01:09:41.415 --> 01:09:43.716
How many numbers can it be?

01:09:43.718 --> 01:09:46.586
I-it can be so many numbers.
Too many numbers.

01:09:46.587 --> 01:09:48.220
I mean, mathematically,
this is impossible.

01:09:48.223 --> 01:09:50.020
- We can't...
- Okay, just-just hold on.

01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:51.890
It's not impossible,
just think of some numbers

01:09:51.893 --> 01:09:54.129
that would be important
to your mom.

01:09:55.429 --> 01:09:58.629
I mean, I-I can try my birthday.

01:09:58.631 --> 01:10:00.602
Yeah. Try that.

01:10:10.143 --> 01:10:12.146
It worked.

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:18.253
- Let's go through the door.
- Yeah.

01:10:39.273 --> 01:10:41.641
Um, my mom's office is just

01:10:41.643 --> 01:10:45.043
is just right through
this room, okay?

01:10:45.045 --> 01:10:46.180
Okay.

01:10:53.854 --> 01:10:55.687
We'll make it there.

01:10:55.689 --> 01:10:57.556
What is that smell?

01:10:57.558 --> 01:10:59.160
Doesn't smell good.

01:11:02.696 --> 01:11:04.532
Wait a second.

01:11:10.004 --> 01:11:11.203
Wait.

01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:18.847
Go! Go!

01:11:19.647 --> 01:11:21.346
Wait!

01:11:23.049 --> 01:11:25.016
Trissy?

01:11:25.018 --> 01:11:26.084
She's upset.

01:11:27.921 --> 01:11:30.122
I think she has some unfinished
business with the other ones.

01:11:32.326 --> 01:11:34.892
Look, I'm sorry, kiddo,
but we gotta leave her here.

01:11:34.894 --> 01:11:37.096
- But...
- Trissy..

01:11:37.098 --> 01:11:41.199
It's the right thing to do.
Leave her here.

01:11:41.201 --> 01:11:43.703
She can handle herself.

01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:46.305
She already proved she can.

01:11:46.307 --> 01:11:47.642
Come on.

01:11:50.045 --> 01:11:52.778
I'm gonna miss you, Bianca.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:55.148
Trissy, we gotta go.

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:57.483
Okay, I'm coming.

01:12:14.369 --> 01:12:15.704
Hello?

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:21.440
What the?

01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:31.018
M-Mandy!

01:12:35.156 --> 01:12:37.025
I'm so sorry.

01:12:39.692 --> 01:12:41.396
Mm. Okay.

01:12:42.662 --> 01:12:44.799
Did I leave the car on?

01:12:48.568 --> 01:12:50.302
No! No!

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:11.757
Hey, guys,
I-I don't see 'em anymore.

01:13:11.759 --> 01:13:13.428
Just keep running.

01:13:16.330 --> 01:13:18.396
Whoa! Shh...

01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:21.132
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:13:21.134 --> 01:13:23.534
I-I'm sorry
I didn't believe you.

01:13:23.536 --> 01:13:25.369
Yeah, you should've.

01:13:25.371 --> 01:13:27.239
Have you seen Gregory?

01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:28.443
Uh..

01:13:29.643 --> 01:13:32.278
Can we talk about that later?

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.878
Okay.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.580
- Drea?
- What?

01:13:35.582 --> 01:13:37.283
- Oh, my God.
- He's back.

01:13:40.219 --> 01:13:42.687
Why is he just staring at us
like that?

01:13:42.689 --> 01:13:44.090
Who cares? Get in!

01:13:44.092 --> 01:13:46.057
Right.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:47.892
Come on, right here.

01:13:47.894 --> 01:13:49.227
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:13:52.066 --> 01:13:53.966
'My car is in the parking lot.'

01:13:53.968 --> 01:13:55.199
We just gotta get there

01:13:55.201 --> 01:13:57.502
and get out
of this shitty campus.

01:13:57.504 --> 01:13:58.971
Shitty campus?

01:13:58.973 --> 01:14:01.440
Yeah. Sucks here.

01:14:01.442 --> 01:14:04.510
Hold up! Why are we running
from these fur balls?

01:14:04.512 --> 01:14:06.110
'Cause we don't wanna die?

01:14:06.112 --> 01:14:08.314
You don't have anything in your
bag like a, like a sharp weapon

01:14:08.316 --> 01:14:10.449
or a knife or, I don't,
I don't know, like a...

01:14:10.451 --> 01:14:14.252
No. I mean, next
to the nunchucks and axe, maybe.

01:14:14.254 --> 01:14:15.289
Wait.

01:14:17.625 --> 01:14:19.591
What's in that shed?

01:14:19.593 --> 01:14:21.162
Yes.

01:14:22.362 --> 01:14:23.294
Okay.

01:14:23.296 --> 01:14:25.864
Okay, everybody out,
go, go, go! Go!

01:14:39.813 --> 01:14:41.646
You guys got all the good stuff.

01:14:41.648 --> 01:14:44.016
I don't know.

01:14:44.018 --> 01:14:46.254
Here, you can have
this leaf blower.

01:14:47.354 --> 01:14:48.620
What am I supposed to do
with that?

01:14:48.622 --> 01:14:49.788
Blow them away, like, literally?

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:51.623
- I don't know.
- Okay, listen.

01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:55.593
All we got is a stupid air horn
and a paintbrush?

01:14:55.595 --> 01:14:57.529
- Wait. Drea.
- What?

01:14:57.531 --> 01:14:59.367
High-pitched sounds.

01:15:00.434 --> 01:15:02.234
Remember?

01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:05.203
Right. Uncle Lewis said
high-pitched sounds.

01:15:05.205 --> 01:15:06.971
They, they hate
high-pitched sounds.

01:15:06.973 --> 01:15:08.940
Okay. Alright, guys.

01:15:08.942 --> 01:15:11.642
I'm, I'm gonna see
if Uncle Lewis was right.

01:15:11.644 --> 01:15:13.080
Uh, just..

01:15:13.848 --> 01:15:15.216
Be careful.

01:15:20.521 --> 01:15:22.988
- 'Why isn't it working?'
- I don't know!

01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:24.323
- 'Is it empty?'
- I don't know.

01:15:24.325 --> 01:15:27.426
It doesn't sound empty.

01:15:27.428 --> 01:15:29.561
'It doesn't sound like
anything, actually.'

01:15:29.563 --> 01:15:31.564
Come on, please, please, please.

01:15:35.768 --> 01:15:36.868
Ha!

01:15:39.741 --> 01:15:42.408
Take that, you little dickhead!

01:15:49.983 --> 01:15:52.251
Okay, okay.

01:15:52.253 --> 01:15:53.886
Now, where's that
other little shit?

01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:04.930
This is for my Uncle Lewis

01:16:04.932 --> 01:16:07.332
the only family I had,
you asshole!

01:16:19.179 --> 01:16:20.044
Oh, no.

01:16:23.884 --> 01:16:24.983
Oh..

01:16:27.754 --> 01:16:29.590
Oh, shit.

01:16:37.798 --> 01:16:41.534
Let's not wait for someone
to come and save us, right?

01:18:29.076 --> 01:18:30.208
Nice.

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:31.944
We got this.

01:18:46.626 --> 01:18:47.659
Are you..

01:18:47.661 --> 01:18:51.529
I'm... fine?

01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:02.140
'I got it, just stay back.'

01:19:04.978 --> 01:19:07.613
Ah! Ah!

01:19:40.781 --> 01:19:43.384
Best blades in the business,
bitch.

01:19:48.988 --> 01:19:51.590
Wow! Oh!

01:19:51.592 --> 01:19:53.458
- You good, bro?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.428
Trissy, I saw you
kickin' butt and taking names.

01:19:56.430 --> 01:19:59.634
Jake, he was kickin' em
like soccer.

01:20:00.733 --> 01:20:02.601
Mandy, it was alright.

01:20:02.603 --> 01:20:06.070
You did that, Philly
cheesesteak, alright? Whoo!

01:20:07.707 --> 01:20:09.608
Drea, behind you!

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.156
Who the hell is that?

01:20:24.758 --> 01:20:27.428
I don't know,
but that's a really big gun.

01:20:29.563 --> 01:20:31.128
Everybody get your weapons.

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.030
- Okay.
- Uh..

01:20:35.768 --> 01:20:38.606
Five against one?
We can fight that bitch.

01:20:40.741 --> 01:20:42.740
Hey, guys, I'm Aunt Dee.

01:20:42.742 --> 01:20:44.943
- Whose aunt are you, exactly?
- Uh..

01:20:50.549 --> 01:20:53.351
I'm a bounty hunter,
I'm looking for the queen

01:20:53.353 --> 01:20:56.157
and I'm pretty sure
she's inside.

01:20:57.057 --> 01:20:58.693
Protect yourselves.

01:21:04.464 --> 01:21:06.265
What just happened?

01:22:19.805 --> 01:22:21.773
Ah.

01:22:21.775 --> 01:22:23.274
There you are.

01:22:40.227 --> 01:22:42.260
You saved me.

01:22:46.567 --> 01:22:49.367
You travelled all this way
to keep the male crites

01:22:49.369 --> 01:22:51.906
from taking over the Earth,
didn't you?

01:22:58.144 --> 01:22:59.914
A peaceful leader.

01:23:02.249 --> 01:23:03.584
Cover me.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.694
Hey, when the phone lines
are back

01:23:15.696 --> 01:23:17.796
I'm gonna give
Professor Lacy a call.

01:23:17.798 --> 01:23:19.396
You should be
her teacher's assistant

01:23:19.398 --> 01:23:21.800
not this babysitting crap.

01:23:21.802 --> 01:23:24.569
No offence.

01:23:24.571 --> 01:23:28.440
If you become
a teacher's assistant for a year

01:23:28.442 --> 01:23:30.742
make a lot of friends in admin

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:32.810
I think you'd have a real shot.

01:23:32.812 --> 01:23:34.447
A year, huh?

01:23:38.018 --> 01:23:39.551
You know, on second thought

01:23:39.553 --> 01:23:42.555
I never really saw myself
as, like, a teacher's assistant.

01:23:44.089 --> 01:23:46.492
Wait, are you serious?

01:23:46.494 --> 01:23:48.062
Hell, yeah.

01:23:49.095 --> 01:23:52.163
Um, does your neck hurt?

01:23:52.165 --> 01:23:53.900
Oh. Uh, no.

01:23:55.902 --> 01:23:57.802
How about now?

01:23:57.804 --> 01:23:58.939
Ow.

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:02.006
Yeah. Now, now it hurts.

01:24:06.278 --> 01:24:08.316
You guys are gross.

01:24:09.348 --> 01:24:10.547
Alright, kids.

01:24:10.549 --> 01:24:12.751
Let's get on the road.

01:24:12.753 --> 01:24:15.555
State police is a long drive.

01:24:23.129 --> 01:24:25.532
- What the hell is that?
- Hey!

01:24:26.265 --> 01:24:27.966
Look alive, guys.

01:24:27.968 --> 01:24:29.234
You know how to use that?

01:24:29.236 --> 01:24:31.572
- Not a damn clue.
- Follow me.

01:24:32.973 --> 01:24:34.471
Drea, are you crazy?

01:24:34.473 --> 01:24:36.108
'Watch the kids!'

01:24:48.388 --> 01:24:50.154
Okay, here we go.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:56.261
Turn that switch on the side.

01:24:56.263 --> 01:24:57.796
Okay.

01:24:59.133 --> 01:25:00.664
Stay calm.

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:02.100
Phillip, help me aim.

01:25:04.405 --> 01:25:05.939
On my count.

01:25:07.206 --> 01:25:08.541
One.

01:25:09.744 --> 01:25:10.878
'Two.'

01:25:12.379 --> 01:25:13.714
Three.

01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:15.879
Kill crites!

01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:25.925
Told you aliens were real.
