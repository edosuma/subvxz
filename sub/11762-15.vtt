WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:03.604
OH, MY GOD, THAT BAG
IS SOAKED WITH GREASE.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.107
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
I DON'T CARE WHAT'S IN IT.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.008
I'M EATIN' IT.
IT'S A HUMAN HEAD.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.010
WELL, IF IT'S DEEP-FRIED,
I'M STILL IN.

00:10.010 --> 00:14.014
(gasps) OH, TRAVIS, THIS IS
MY FAVORITE FRIED CHICKEN!

00:14.014 --> 00:15.746
OH, WOW!

00:15.746 --> 00:17.248
WAIT. WHY?

00:17.248 --> 00:20.421
ARE YOU ON DRUGS?
IS SOMEONE PREGNANT? HUH?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.423
OH, GOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT, TRAVIS?

00:22.423 --> 00:25.156
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, HONEY,
WE ARE GONNA GET THROUGH IT.

00:25.156 --> 00:27.128
WHENEVER THEY OPEN
A NEW CHICKEN DANDIES,

00:27.128 --> 00:29.500
THE FIRST 50 PEOPLE IN LINE
GET FREE FOOD FOR A MONTH.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.802
SO AFTER WAITING BEHIND A LARGE
GENTLEMAN FOR 20-PLUS HOURS

00:31.802 --> 00:34.805
WHO WAS USING A PAINT BUCKET
AS A BOTH A CHAIR AND A COMMODE,

00:34.805 --> 00:36.807
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
CUSTOMER NUMBER THREE.

00:36.807 --> 00:41.172
HOW DID YOU WAIT IN LINE SO LONG
WITHOUT MISSING SCHOOL?

00:41.172 --> 00:43.174
WAFFLE FRY?

00:43.174 --> 00:45.816
DID YOU REALLY CALL TRAVIS
IN SICK FROM SCHOOL

00:45.816 --> 00:48.649
SO YOU TWO COULD WAIT IN LINE
FOR FREE CHICKEN?

00:48.649 --> 00:51.082
SHOOT. I FORGOT TO CALL
HIS SCHOOL, DIDN'T I?

00:51.082 --> 00:53.554
WOW, YOU'RE STILL NOT GREAT
AT ZONING IN ON WHY I'M ANGRY.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.557
LOOK, IN MY DEFENSE, I JUST ATE
A GALLON JUG OF FREE COLESLAW.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.160
MY BRAIN'S
A LITTLE MAYONNAISE-Y.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.492
BOBBY, WHEN IT COMES TO TRAVIS,
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO ME FIRST.

01:01.492 --> 01:03.134
I KNOW WE'RE DIVORCED,

01:03.134 --> 01:07.098
BUT WE STILL HAVE TO DO ALL
OF OUR PARENTING TOGETHER, OKAY?

01:07.098 --> 01:10.401
WE'RE A TEAM.
FINE, BUT I GET TO PICK
THE TEAM MASCOT.

01:10.401 --> 01:12.473
COLESLAW!

01:12.473 --> 01:14.475
WAIT,
LET ME TRY THAT AGAIN.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.750
YOU'RE STILL STUCK ON COLESLAW.
WON'T GET OUT OF MY HEAD.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.212
WHERE'S JULES?

01:21.212 --> 01:23.654
ANDY AND I ARE GOING ON
A ROMANTIC COUPLES LUNCH,

01:23.654 --> 01:26.687
AND I WANT HER
TO COME WITH US.
SHE'S ACROSS THE STREET
GETTING A PEDICURE.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.860
OOH, I LOVE THAT
SHE'S DOING THAT. (chuckles)

01:29.860 --> 01:31.822
IT'S NOTHING WEIRD.
I JUST LIKE FEET.

01:31.822 --> 01:33.364
(lowers voice) AND ASIANS.

01:33.364 --> 01:34.565
CHARMING.

01:34.565 --> 01:36.527
WAIT HERE. I'M GONNA
GO TO THAT LINGERIE STORE

01:36.527 --> 01:38.529
AND PICK OUT WHAT YOU'RE
BUYING ME FOR VALENTINE'S DAY.

01:38.529 --> 01:40.571
GET SEXY PANTIES.
I LOVE PANTIES!

01:40.571 --> 01:41.872
PANTIES AND FEET.

01:41.872 --> 01:45.136
ALL RIGHT. OH, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT PANTIES ARE?

01:45.136 --> 01:47.608
THEY'RE A TYPE OF CLOTHES
THAT MOST WOMEN WEAR

01:47.608 --> 01:50.141
UNDER THEIR SKIRTS.

01:50.141 --> 01:52.543
PASS.

01:52.543 --> 01:55.286
SO... WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY?

01:55.286 --> 01:57.588
YOU KNOW THAT GUY SMITH
I'M DATING?
NOPE.

01:57.588 --> 01:58.889
DOESN'T MATTER.

01:58.889 --> 02:01.152
HE'S DRIVING HOME
FROM LAW SCHOOL.

02:01.152 --> 02:03.824
HE WANTS ME TO MEET HIS DAD.
ISN'T THAT ROMANTIC?

02:03.824 --> 02:06.727
THAT DEPENDS
ON WHAT YOU THREE ARE DOIN'.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.859
FEET, PANTIES, ASIANS
AND THREESOMES.

02:08.859 --> 02:10.861
LETTIN' IT ALL OUT TODAY.

02:10.861 --> 02:13.364
MY COUSIN RUNS A WEB SITE
THAT YOU'D REALLY BE INTO.

02:13.364 --> 02:15.806
THERE'S ACTUALLY
A PICTURE ON THERE

02:15.806 --> 02:18.809
OF MY BARE FEET
DRIPPING IN HONEY.
YOU'RE HONEY TOES?

02:18.809 --> 02:21.642
YEAH.
OH, MY GOD! YOU ARE.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.275
THIS WHOLE DAD THING
JUST HAS ME SO NERVOUS.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.717
ANDY!

02:26.717 --> 02:28.379
SORRY. YOU'LL BE FINE.

02:28.379 --> 02:31.382
JUST DO WHAT I DID
WHEN I FIRST MET ELLIE'S FOLKS--

02:31.382 --> 02:33.484
BE YOURSELF, ONLY LESS LATINO.

02:33.484 --> 02:35.286
OH.

02:35.286 --> 02:38.789
OH, LOOK. THERE'S A LITTLE OLD
BIRD'S NEST ON THE WINDOWSILL.

02:38.789 --> 02:41.862
OH, HEY, DID YOU EVER HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION WITH ANDY

02:41.862 --> 02:43.864
ABOUT DOING SOME
DOWNSTAIRS MAN GROOMING?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.896
DIDN'T HAVE TO. I SIGNED HIM UP
FOR AN EYEBROW WAX,

02:45.896 --> 02:47.938
WHICH IS REALLY A BIKINI WAX.

02:47.938 --> 02:50.641
ANDY WILL BE SO TURNED ON
BY ALL THE SCREAMING KOREANS,

02:50.641 --> 02:52.803
HE WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT HIM UNTIL
HE'S SLIDING AROUND OUR BED

02:52.803 --> 02:55.946
LIKE A CANNED HAM.
I'M NOT REALLY BIG
ON THE MANSCAPING.

02:55.946 --> 02:59.550
YOU DON'T HUSK THE CORN?
NAH. IF IT'S HUMID,
I MIGHT THROW IN

02:59.550 --> 03:01.812
A LITTLE LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER
DOWN THERE.

03:01.812 --> 03:03.584
ANYWAY, THANKS FOR THE COFFEE

03:03.584 --> 03:06.387
AND THE REALLY WEIRD
PERSONAL CONVERSATION.
(Ellie and Jules) BYE.

03:06.387 --> 03:09.290
YOU HAVE LET TOO MANY PEOPLE
INTO OUR COFFEE CIRCLE.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.191
WHY DON'T YOU JUST INVITE

03:11.191 --> 03:13.764
THOSE CREEPY HOMESCHOOLED KIDS
FROM NEXT DOOR?

03:13.764 --> 03:17.228
THEY CAN WOW US WITH MATH SKILLS
WHILE THEY STAB US TO DEATH.
FINE. WHO DO YOU WANT
TO BE IN OUR COFFEE CIRCLE?

03:17.228 --> 03:20.231
JUST YOU AND ME.
THIS IS OUR SHOPPING CIRCLE
ARGUMENT ALL OVER AGAIN.

03:20.231 --> 03:22.433
SO, MOM, SINCE WE HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP

03:22.433 --> 03:24.735
PROFESSIONALS HAVE DEEMED
"UNHEALTHY"...
(chuckles) THEY HAVE.

03:24.735 --> 03:26.937
THAT'S CUTE.
DAVID SCHOENBURGER'S
HAVING A PARTY THIS WEEKEND.

03:26.937 --> 03:29.580
ARE--
NO, HIS PARENTS
WON'T BE THERE.

03:29.580 --> 03:32.913
WILL--
YES, THERE WILL BE BEER,
BUT I WON'T BE DRINKING.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.886
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SAY NO?!

03:35.886 --> 03:37.918
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

03:37.918 --> 03:39.490
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

03:39.490 --> 03:42.323
IT'S CALLED PARENTING, ELLIE.
TRY AND KEEP UP.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.824
JULES.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.257
MAY I PRESENT...

03:46.257 --> 03:47.598
SMITH FRANK.

03:47.598 --> 03:49.960
WOW. YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE
EVEN PRETTIER THAN LAURIE SAID.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.732
STRONG START, SMITH.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.435
EVEN THOUGH HE DRESSES
LIKE AN ACCOUNTANT,

03:54.435 --> 03:56.467
CHECK THIS OUT--
WHA-BAM! CRAZY SOCKS!

03:56.467 --> 03:59.270
WE FEEL THESE SAY
I CAN STILL GET FUNKY.

03:59.270 --> 04:02.373
WELL, IT'S BUSINESS UPSTAIRS
AND PARTY DOWNSTAIRS. I LIKE IT.

04:02.373 --> 04:04.845
(chuckles) WOW,
YOU SEEM PERFECT. RIGHT?

04:04.845 --> 04:09.249
I MEAN, ALMOST TOO PERFECT.
WHAT'S YOUR DIRTY SECRET, SMITH?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.623
I WILL NOT BE QUESTIONED
BY A WOMAN.

04:12.623 --> 04:16.687
OH, MY GOD. THAT WAS--
THAT WAS... FUNNIER IN MY HEAD.

04:16.687 --> 04:18.789
UM, I'M--I'M SORRY. THAT WAS--

04:18.789 --> 04:20.931
YEAH, I'M FEELING
A LITTLE NAUSEOUS,

04:20.931 --> 04:23.464
SO I THINK I'M GONNA, UM...
(clears throat) SIT.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.036
I LIKE HIM.
ME, TOO!

04:26.036 --> 04:28.038
TELL HENDERSON
THAT I THINK

04:28.038 --> 04:30.871
A ZERO-DOWN COMMERCIAL RE-FI
IN A CRATERING ECONOMY

04:30.871 --> 04:32.873
IS A SLAM DUNK IDEA!

04:32.873 --> 04:37.277
WHOA. THAT IS SOME GRADE "A"
SMART GUY GIBBERISH.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.580
AND LOOK AT THIS OFFICE.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.682
IF I EVER I SOLD MY BOAT,
I COULD LIVE HERE.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.785
NO.
(laughs) OKAY, I WAS JUST
THINKING OUT LOUD, BROTHER.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.787
MAN, YOU ARE LIKE
THE BIG DOG

04:46.787 --> 04:50.391
WITH LOW-HANGING FRUIT
AROUND HERE, AREN'T YOU?
WATCH THIS.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.963
PAUL!
YES, SIR?

04:56.897 --> 04:58.329
(grunts)

05:00.831 --> 05:03.073
SEE? THAT'S WORK ANDY.

05:03.073 --> 05:05.005
HE'S SEXY. IS THAT HOW
YOU BAGGED ELLIE?

05:05.005 --> 05:07.538
WORK ANDY
ALSO MAKES A LOT OF DOUGH.

05:07.538 --> 05:10.581
GOTCHA. HEY, YOU WANT
TO GO GRAB LUNCH?

05:10.581 --> 05:12.583
SORRY. I GOTTA PREP
FOR A MEETING TOMORROW.

05:12.583 --> 05:14.044
BIG POTENTIAL CLIENT.

05:14.044 --> 05:16.747
IF I MANAGE THIS GUY'S MONEY,
IT WOULD BE A CAREER CHANGER.

05:16.747 --> 05:18.749
(cell phone rings)
OH! THAT'S ELLIE.

05:18.749 --> 05:21.422
SHE'S HELPING ME STAY FOCUSED
ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.924
HEY, HONEY.
I WANT A NEW CAR!

05:23.924 --> 05:27.958
IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEONE
IN MY CORNER.

05:27.958 --> 05:31.432
OH, HEY, MOM.
HEY, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.964
IT'S YOUR OLD
HIGH SCHOOL PHOTO ALBUM.

05:33.964 --> 05:36.507
WELL, THIS ISN'T GOING
TO GO WELL FOR ME, IS IT?

05:36.507 --> 05:38.609
FOR YOU? NO.
FOR ME? (kisses) DELICIOUS.

05:38.609 --> 05:40.611
IN THIS PICTURE,

05:40.611 --> 05:43.644
YOU APPEAR TO BE IN A MOVING CAR
WITH A BEER IN BOTH HANDS.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.816
FUN!
I'M NOT DRIVING.

05:45.816 --> 05:48.619
OH, SO I CAN DRINK
AS LONG AS I'M NOT DRIVING.

05:48.619 --> 05:50.651
YOU'RE TWISTING MY WORDS.
YOU'RE A WORD TWISTER.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.983
ELLIE, HE'S A WORD TWISTER.
THE HYPOCRITICAL PHOTO ALBUM.

05:52.983 --> 05:54.985
KEEP LOOKING, TRAVIS.
YOU'LL FIND OUT

05:54.985 --> 05:58.659
WHY SHE NAMED YOUR HAMSTERS
"JAGER" AND "MEISTER."
YOU WITH BEER.

05:58.659 --> 05:59.990
YOU DOING SHOTS.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.532
OOH! CIGARETTES!

06:01.532 --> 06:03.834
WERE THOSE AS COOL
AS THEY LOOK?

06:03.834 --> 06:07.097
SOMETIMES.
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT
NOT TO LET ME GO TO THE PARTY.

06:07.097 --> 06:09.099
I MEAN, YOU WERE ALLOWED
TO HAVE FUN AS A KID.

06:09.099 --> 06:12.072
AND NOW YOU CAN'T EVEN GO ONE
NIGHT WITHOUT A GLASS OF WINE.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.074
YES, I CAN.
OKAY, HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.577
WELL, I CAN'T DO IT TONIGHT.
IT'S WEDNESDAY. TOMORROW.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.679
NO, I CAN'T DO IT TOMORROW.
AND THEN IT'S THE WEEKEND,

06:18.679 --> 06:20.881
AND THEN, WELL,
THAT'S JUST CRAZY TALK.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.654
UM, HOW ABOUT
I DON'T DRINK FOR A NIGHT

06:23.654 --> 06:26.917
STARTING MONDAY MORNING?
MRS. TORRES, ARE YOU GONNA
BE AROUND LATER

06:26.917 --> 06:29.420
IF I WANT TO DO
AN INTERVENTION?
MY SPEECH IS ALREADY WRITTEN.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.122
ALL RIGHT, FINE!
I'LL DO IT TONIGHT.
GOOD LUCK.

06:32.122 --> 06:34.665
I DON'T NEED LUCK, TRAVIS.
MMM! MMM!

06:34.665 --> 06:36.967
OH, GIVE IT TO ME.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.870
REALLY? TWO SECONDS?

06:39.870 --> 06:41.472
(spits)

06:44.675 --> 06:47.578
WHAT?
I'M STILL DRINKING IT.

06:47.578 --> 06:52.513
в™Єв™Є

06:58.148 --> 07:00.591
WELL, ENJOY THE DAY,

07:00.591 --> 07:03.123
KNOWING YOU'VE TAKEN
WHAT LITTLE SOCIAL LIFE I HAVE

07:03.123 --> 07:05.626
AND MURDERED IT.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.798
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR THE 'TUDE, DUDE.

07:07.798 --> 07:09.900
RHYME-FIVE. THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.201
YOU'RE INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.

07:11.201 --> 07:12.933
THANKS, SWEETIE. LOVE YOU.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.035
SO WHAT ARE YOU AND ANDY DOING
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY?

07:15.035 --> 07:17.037
(door opens and closes)
OH, THE USUAL.
WE GO TO THE DRUGSTORE

07:17.037 --> 07:19.039
AND BUY UP
ALL THE VALENTINE'S DAY CARDS.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.772
THEN WE WATCH
THE FORGETFUL HUSBANDS PANIC.

07:21.772 --> 07:23.614
THERE IS NOTHING BETTER
THAN WATCHING A MAN

07:23.614 --> 07:25.215
BUYING A BAR MITZVAH CARD
TRYING TO CHANGE

07:25.215 --> 07:28.078
THE STAR OF DAVID INTO A HEART.
(laughs)

07:28.078 --> 07:30.080
LAURIE HAS PLANS, TOO.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

07:30.080 --> 07:32.082
WHO'S THE LUCKY YOUNG GIRL
OFF YOUR BOINK LIST

07:32.082 --> 07:34.725
THAT GETS THE GOLDEN TICKET?
ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

07:34.725 --> 07:37.828
NONE OF THEM. THAT WOULD
IMPLY CARING. WRONG MESSAGE.

07:37.828 --> 07:39.790
YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST REALIZED?

07:39.790 --> 07:41.962
YOU'RE GONNA BE THE MISTAKE
THAT ALL THOSE GIRLS LEARN FROM.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.064
YEAH. I DO IT FOR THEM.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.066
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU AND I COULD HANG OUT.

07:46.066 --> 07:49.239
YOU KNOW, JUST AS FRIENDS. YOU
KNOW, WE CAN DRINK SOME BEERS,

07:49.239 --> 07:52.472
MAKE FUN OF HOW LAME
VALENTINE'S DAY IS.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.974
BUT NOT TOO MUCH

07:53.974 --> 07:55.976
BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
HOLIDAY GOD EVER CREATED.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.208
IT'S A FAKE HOLIDAY
CREATED BY CANDY COMPANIES

07:58.208 --> 08:01.752
TO PREY ON
SAD AND LONELY WOMEN.
(singsongy) HELLO.

08:01.752 --> 08:05.085
AHH. HE'S GONNA BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.987
OH, HEY, RELAX.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.989
YOU WEARING
THOSE LUCKY BOXERS I GOT YOU?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.991
WIENER DOGS AND BALLOONS!

08:10.991 --> 08:13.063
YEAH, BABY! (laughs)
(laughs)

08:13.063 --> 08:15.065
(intercom beeps)
(man) Mr. Frank is here.

08:15.065 --> 08:16.567
UH, ALL RIGHT.

08:16.567 --> 08:19.029
UH, WAIT 12 SECONDS
AND THEN SEND HIM IN. THANK YOU.

08:19.029 --> 08:20.531
ALL RIGHT.

08:20.531 --> 08:23.003
CONFIDENCE DANCE.

08:25.836 --> 08:27.778
BOOM! GO GET 'EM, CHAMP.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.782
AH, MR. FRANK.
PLEASE COME ON IN.

08:31.782 --> 08:34.745
ROBERT "BOBBY" COBB. ANOTHER ONE
OF ANDREW'S CLIENTS HERE.

08:34.745 --> 08:36.747
TELL HENDERSON
I THINK THAT

08:36.747 --> 08:38.849
A ZERO-DOWN COMMERCIAL RE-FI
IN A CRATERING ECONOMY

08:38.849 --> 08:42.122
IS A SLAM DUNK IDEA.
BUT ASSUMING MORE DEBT
PROHIBITS A POSITIVE CASH FLOW,

08:42.122 --> 08:44.124
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

08:44.124 --> 08:46.526
I GOTTA PEE.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.998
YOU KNOW, UM,

08:47.998 --> 08:50.901
HAVING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS UP
SIX WEEKS AFTER CHRISTMAS

08:50.901 --> 08:53.063
IS ACTUALLY DANGEROUS.
HOW SO?

08:53.063 --> 08:56.066
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T TAKE THEM
DOWN, I'M GONNA FEED THEM TO YOU

08:56.066 --> 08:58.739
AND THEN YANK THEM
OUT THE OTHER END

08:58.739 --> 09:01.141
LIKE I'M STARTING
A LAWN MOWER.
I LOVE OUR LITTLE TALKS.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.914
WHEN I'M IN THE TREADMILL
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW,

09:03.914 --> 09:06.947
THEY'RE DRIVING ME INSANE.
I DON'T EVEN TURN 'EM ON.
HOW CAN YOU SEE 'EM?

09:06.947 --> 09:09.780
I KNOW THEY'RE THERE.
I'LL TAKE 'EM DOWN.
OKAY. IT'S NO BIGGIE.

09:09.780 --> 09:13.153
IT IS A HUGE BIGGIE.
YOU'RE IN OUR COFFEE CIRCLE NOW,

09:13.153 --> 09:15.155
AND ELLIE CONSIDERS HERSELF
ALPHA DOG.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.988
IF YOU GIVE IN, SHE'S GONNA
DOMINATE YOU FOREVER.

09:17.988 --> 09:20.330
YOU JUST MAKE ALL THE RULES

09:20.330 --> 09:23.033
ABOUT PARTIES AND DRINKING
WITHOUT TALKIN' TO ME?

09:23.033 --> 09:25.135
WHAT HAPPENED TO PARENTING
AS TEAM COLESLAW?

09:25.135 --> 09:27.968
HAVE FUN WITH THAT.
NOW WE'RE EVEN.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.740
TRAVIS, WE'LL NEVER BE EVEN.

09:29.740 --> 09:32.202
DO I NEED TO SHOW YOU
MY SCAR FROM MY C-SECTION?

09:32.202 --> 09:35.145
IT'S GOT A HAIR
GROWING IN IT NOW.

09:35.145 --> 09:39.279
COME ON,
IT'S NOT THAT GROSS.
YEAH, IT IS.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.152
(strained voice) KNOCKED
THE WIND OUT OF ME. OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.
THERE'S TWO OF THEM.

09:42.152 --> 09:44.084
I LIKE YOUR CLUB.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.156
THANK YOU.

09:46.156 --> 09:48.158
TELL ME, AM I THE, UH,

09:48.158 --> 09:51.121
FIRST HISPANIC PERSON
EVER TO SET FOOT IN HERE?
IS THE ROCK HISPANIC?

09:51.121 --> 09:53.223
NO, BUT HE CAN PASS
FOR ANYTHING.

09:53.223 --> 09:56.026
THAT'S WHY HIS CAREER
IS ON FIRE.
(chuckles)

09:56.026 --> 09:57.197
DAD.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.999
SMITH.
LAURIE.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.701
ANDY?
ROGER.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.073
YEAH, I KNOW
I JUST SAID MY OWN NAME.

10:03.073 --> 10:05.075
I LIKE THE SOUND OF IT.

10:05.075 --> 10:07.237
PLUS, WE HAVEN'T MET.
ROGER FRANK.

10:07.237 --> 10:11.041
OH. (chuckles)
LAURIE KELLER.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.713
WOW.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.715
I WAS HERE ONCE
WHEN I WAS A KID

10:14.715 --> 10:16.717
FOR THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS
PARTY.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.949
YES, THE ONE
FOR NEEDY FAMILIES.

10:18.949 --> 10:24.324
THAT EXPLAINS WHY MY GIFT SAID
"FOR GIRL AGE 6 TO 10."

10:24.324 --> 10:27.157
(light jazz piano playing)

10:27.157 --> 10:29.029
WHO WANTS A GIANT DRINK?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.662
I DO!
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.
THANK YOU.

10:31.662 --> 10:34.334
YES, I DECIDED THAT
OUR UNDERAGE SON CAN'T DRINK.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.637
BUT TO BE FAIR, I DIDN'T MAKE UP
THAT RULE. AMERICA DID.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.640
YOU THINK BY JUST TELLING HIM
"NO," HE'S NOT GONNA DO IT?

10:40.640 --> 10:44.675
HELL, JULES, YOUR PARENTS
TOLD YOU NOT TO SLEEP WITH ME.
YEAH, EVEN AFTER
WE WERE MARRIED.

10:44.675 --> 10:47.047
YOU'RE JUST CREATING A--
REALLY?
YEAH.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.049
LOOK, YOU'RE JUST CREATING
A SITUATION

10:49.049 --> 10:51.051
WHERE TRAVIS WILL BE
SO AFRAID TO GET CAUGHT

10:51.051 --> 10:54.885
HE WON'T CALL FOR A RIDE HOME
IF HE'S BEEN DRINKIN'.
DO YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?

10:54.885 --> 10:57.688
MAYBE I DO, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT
LIKE IT. SO FIRST...

10:57.688 --> 10:59.189
CONFIDENCE DANCE!

11:01.231 --> 11:02.863
JULES?

11:02.863 --> 11:06.196
(groans) I HATE THAT
I HAVE TO DO IT WITH YOU.
COME ON.

11:09.239 --> 11:11.441
SO YOU NEVER ANSWERED ME
ABOUT VALENTINE'S DAY.

11:11.441 --> 11:14.174
COME ON, WE COULD HANG OUT
LIKE TWO GUYS

11:14.174 --> 11:16.146
AND DRINK BEER
AND HAVE A FARTING CONTEST.

11:16.146 --> 11:20.250
THAT'S WHAT GUYS DO
WHEN THEY'RE ALONE, RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT I DO
WITH MY FRIENDS.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.682
SO WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO
ON OUR UN-VALENTINE'S DAY?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.685
WHY DON'T WE JUST SKIP IT?
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S ONE IDEA.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.058
BUT, YOU KNOW,
LET'S KEEP SPITBALLING.

11:28.058 --> 11:32.192
ANY OTHER DAY BUT TODAY.
IS THAT OKAY?
SURE. IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

11:34.064 --> 11:36.226
OH!
OH, GOD.

11:36.226 --> 11:38.268
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

11:38.268 --> 11:42.232
MRS. ELLIE TELL ME
TAKE THEM DOWN THE LIGHTS.

11:42.232 --> 11:44.034
ALPHA DOG.

11:46.206 --> 11:50.140
HEY. LET'S EAT QUICK SO WE CAN
GO HOME AND KNOCK ONE OUT.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.813
I LIKE THAT I NEVER WONDER
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.115
(Laurie) I KNOW. HMM.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.417
I GUESS A QUARTER-
OF-A-MILLION-DOLLAR EDUCATION

11:57.417 --> 12:00.490
DOESN'T TEACH YOU NOT TO
BED DOWN TRAILER TRASH, RIGHT?

12:00.490 --> 12:02.722
WELL...

12:02.722 --> 12:04.494
UH, A QUARTER-MILLION DOLLARS.

12:04.494 --> 12:08.098
OH, THINK OF HOW MANY OF THOSE
WATCHES YOU COULD'VE BOUGHT.
ONE.

12:08.098 --> 12:09.860
STUNNING, REALLY.

12:09.860 --> 12:13.133
SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE BELONGS
ON A TRUCK'S MUD FLAP.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.805
(chuckles nervously)

12:14.805 --> 12:16.837
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, YOU
KNOW, WHENEVER I SAW A TRUCK,

12:16.837 --> 12:20.140
I'D ALWAYS, YOU KNOW...
(imitates horn honk)

12:20.140 --> 12:22.112
(laughs) I WAS--
I LIKE TRUCKS.

12:22.112 --> 12:25.275
YOU DON'T AGREE THAT SMITH
IS WAY OUT OF HER LEAGUE?

12:25.275 --> 12:28.218
NO. NO, NO, NO.
I-I-I--I'M--I'M WITH YOU.

12:28.218 --> 12:29.349
I-I AGREE.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.121
UH. THAT...

12:31.121 --> 12:33.423
THAT GIRL IS NOT CLASSY.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.257
(chuckles)

12:40.831 --> 12:42.833
DO YOU KNOW
HOW OLD I WAS

12:42.833 --> 12:45.195
THE FIRST TIME
I GOT REALLY DRUNK?

12:45.195 --> 12:46.536
I DON'T KNOW. 9?

12:46.536 --> 12:48.198
HA! TRICK QUESTION.

12:48.198 --> 12:50.440
NEVER BEEN REALLY DRUNK.
I HAVE A MONSTER TOLERANCE.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.443
THE POINT IS--
NO, DAD, THERE IS NO POINT
TO THAT STORY.

12:53.443 --> 12:55.445
ALL RIGHT,
THE COMPLETELY NEW THOUGHT IS,

12:55.445 --> 12:58.148
YOUR MOM DOESN'T WANT
YOU DRINKING. NEITHER DO I.

12:58.148 --> 13:01.181
BUT YOU'RE GONNA DO WHAT YOU DO,
SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.283
IF YOU DRINK, DO NOT DRIVE.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.116
CALL ME, AND I'LL DRIVE YOU
HOME. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

13:06.116 --> 13:09.089
DOES MOM KNOW ABOUT THIS?
OUR SECRET.
YOU COOL WITH THAT?

13:09.089 --> 13:11.321
TOTALLY COOL.
WHAT'S TOTALLY COOL?

13:11.321 --> 13:13.964
JAZZ.
SHARKS.

13:13.964 --> 13:16.226
JAZZ SHARKS?
YEAH, YOU KNOW, THE, UH,
THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

13:16.226 --> 13:18.228
YEAH, THE MIAMI JAZZ SHARKS.

13:18.228 --> 13:19.900
I GUESS THAT'S COOL.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.201
JAZZ SHARKS!

13:21.201 --> 13:23.573
OOH. YEAH, I DO LIKE IT.

13:23.573 --> 13:27.207
SHE COULD LOOK THAT UP.
SHE'S NOT GOING TO.

13:34.584 --> 13:36.586
OH, HEY.
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY, TRAV.

13:36.586 --> 13:38.588
OKAY, FOR MY PRESENT,
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME

13:38.588 --> 13:41.421
THE SAME THING YOU GAVE ME
WHEN YOU WERE 5.

13:41.421 --> 13:45.125
I WANT A KISS ON THE LIPS.
RAISE YOUR HAND
IF YOU FIND THAT DISTURBING.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.457
ONLY YOU, MY FRIEND.

13:47.457 --> 13:49.459
OH, MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE

13:49.459 --> 13:51.932
ALL THE STUPID STUFF WE DID
WHEN I WAS A KID.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.834
I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING
THAT WE DIDN'T DIE.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.137
I ALMOST DROWNED WHEN I WAS 12,
BODYSURFING UNDER THE PIER.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.870
I WAS TECHNICALLY DEAD
FOR, LIKE, TWO MINUTES.

13:59.870 --> 14:02.312
LUCKILY, NO BRAIN DAMAGE.

14:02.312 --> 14:05.115
TOO EASY.

14:05.115 --> 14:07.277
I KNOW THAT TRAVIS THINKS
I'M OVERPROTECTIVE.

14:07.277 --> 14:09.279
BUT THAT'S ALL
THAT PARENTING REALLY IS,

14:09.279 --> 14:11.851
IS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP YOUR KID FROM DYING.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.484
WHEN HE WAS A BABY, IT WAS
SOFT SPOTS AND SWIMMING POOLS.

14:14.484 --> 14:16.456
AND WHEN HE'S 50,

14:16.456 --> 14:19.129
IT'LL BE HEART ATTACKS
AND RUSSIAN PROSTITUTES.

14:19.129 --> 14:21.531
NO, I'M NOT JOKING.
ONE GOT MY UNCLE.

14:21.531 --> 14:24.134
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:24.134 --> 14:26.366
WHY ARE YOU IN
THE BALL OF SADNESS?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.368
TO SUCK UP TO ROGER FRANK,

14:28.368 --> 14:31.201
I SAID SOME REALLY MEAN THINGS
ABOUT A NICE PERSON.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.303
BUT YOU DON'T DO
STUFF LIKE THAT. I DO.

14:33.303 --> 14:36.306
THAT'S WHY WE'RE KNOWN AS
THE NICE GUY AND THE OTHER ONE.

14:36.306 --> 14:38.608
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE
WHO YOU ARE TO GET AHEAD, ANDY.

14:38.608 --> 14:41.251
WHO'D YOU TRASH?
LAURIE.

14:41.251 --> 14:43.283
LAURIE?! YOU TRICKED ME!

14:43.283 --> 14:46.486
BALL BACK UP AND THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU JUST DID! OH!

14:49.059 --> 14:51.291
ARE YOU MAD BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
HANGING OUT TONIGHT?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.293
NO, I'M GOOD.
ALL GOOD IN THE HOOD.

14:53.293 --> 14:56.126
RHYME-FIVE, BUT I'M NOT DOING IT
WITH YOU BECAUSE YOU SUCK.

14:56.126 --> 14:59.129
I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT MAD.
I KNOW VALENTINE'S DAY
IS GOOFY.

14:59.129 --> 15:01.972
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVEN'T
SPENT ONE ALONE SINCE I WAS 11.

15:01.972 --> 15:03.974
THAT'S WHEN THE GIRLS
SHOWED UP.

15:03.974 --> 15:07.007
I'VE HAD 30 STRAIGHT YEARS OF
BEING A VALENTINE'S DAY WINNER,

15:07.007 --> 15:11.141
AND, WELL,
NOW I'M NOT, AND...

15:11.141 --> 15:14.084
THAT'S WHY THIS ONE'S
GONNA SUCK.

15:14.084 --> 15:17.247
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
IF THIS THING WORKS.

15:17.247 --> 15:19.549
HELLO, ELLIE!

15:19.549 --> 15:22.152
SON OF A BITCH!

15:22.152 --> 15:24.154
DID YOU KNOW IN FRENCH,

15:24.154 --> 15:26.396
"VALENTINE" MEANS
"TO GET BUCK NAKED"?

15:26.396 --> 15:30.160
(chuckles) WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SEE ME VALENTINE, DORIS?

15:30.160 --> 15:32.202
YOU SAID THERE WAS
FREE CHICKEN.

15:32.202 --> 15:35.005
(cell phone rings)
(clears throat)

15:35.005 --> 15:36.336
(ring)

15:36.336 --> 15:37.707
HELLO?

15:37.707 --> 15:40.340
I ONLY HAD, LIKE, THREE BEERS.
I WASN'T EVEN GONNA DRINK,

15:40.340 --> 15:44.314
BUT DAVE SCHOENBURGER WENT
TO ROBOTICS CAMP, AND--
THIS SOME KIND OF NERD PARTY?

15:44.314 --> 15:45.475
NO.
(chuckles)

15:45.475 --> 15:48.048
ANYWAY, DAVE BROUGHT OUT
HIS BEER-SERVING ROBOT--

15:48.048 --> 15:50.050
HEY, WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,
BUDDY.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.052
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GET
YOUR MOM'S CAR TOMORROW.

15:52.052 --> 15:54.054
NOW I WANT YOU
TO SNEAK IN THE BACK

15:54.054 --> 15:56.256
WHILE I CREATE A DISTRACTION
DOING TRASH RACCOONS.
TRASH RACCOONS?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.328
GO! GO! GO! GO!
GO! GO! GO!

15:58.328 --> 16:00.030
GO! GO! GO!

16:00.030 --> 16:02.562
(rattling)
(dog barking in distance)

16:06.036 --> 16:08.268
(click)
(inhales deeply)

16:08.268 --> 16:10.600
I WAS MARRIED TO YOUR DAD
FOR 20 YEARS.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.143
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
TRASH RACCOONS?

16:13.143 --> 16:15.305
LET ME SMELL YOUR BREATH.
MNH-MNH.

16:15.305 --> 16:17.347
MM-HMM.

16:17.347 --> 16:20.050
HAVE YOU EVER GONE AGAINST
EVERYTHING YOU STAND FOR

16:20.050 --> 16:22.512
JUST FOR MONEY?
MANY, MANY TIMES.

16:22.512 --> 16:24.054
(Laurie) OH!

16:24.054 --> 16:27.257
SMITH'S DAD TOLD ME
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT ME.

16:27.257 --> 16:28.718
"NOT CLASSY," HUH?

16:28.718 --> 16:31.061
I THOUGHT
WE WERE FRIENDS, ANDY.

16:31.061 --> 16:33.493
I AM SO SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
HIT ME. I DESERVE IT.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.196
JUST NOT IN THE CROTCH
'CAUSE I WANNA HAVE ANOTHER KID.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.198
ELLIE DOESN'T KNOW THAT
SO PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.170
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
WAIT. GO AHEAD.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.632
(Smith and Laurie laugh)

16:42.632 --> 16:46.706
WE'RE TOTALLY KIDDING, DUDE.
AH. THAT WAS NOT
A STRONG MOMENT FOR YOU.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.710
NO, FOR HIM, THAT WAS OKAY.
SO WE'RE--WE'RE ALL GOOD THEN?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.712
ANDY,
I GET THAT YOU'RE BEING

16:52.712 --> 16:54.344
ALL BUSINESS CHUMMY
WITH HIS DAD.

16:54.344 --> 16:56.516
I AM SO NOT OFFENDED.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.349
PLUS, HONEY, I HAVE
BEEN CALLED WAY WORSE--

16:59.349 --> 17:02.152
SKANK, TRAMP, WHITE DEVIL.

17:02.152 --> 17:04.624
I LIKED THAT ONE SO MUCH
I PUT IT ON MY LICENSE PLATE.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.099
HEY, GRAYSON.
HERE'S YOUR BUSH.

17:11.161 --> 17:14.564
HEY, HONEY! (blows kiss)
HI--HEY, BABE.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.539
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
NO CAR AND A CURFEW.

17:19.539 --> 17:23.373
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO
YOUR LITTLE SWIMSUIT CALENDAR.

17:23.373 --> 17:24.544
WHY?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.546
WELL, IT'S NOT
PART OF THE PUNISHMENT.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.749
IT'S JUST OBVIOUS.
DUDE, DON'T BE THAT GUY.
(exhales deeply) WHATEVER.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.223
"WHATEVER"?! DID YOU JUST
"WHATEVER" ME? REALLY?

17:33.223 --> 17:35.625
HEY, HOW DID YOU GET HOME
TONIGHT?

17:35.625 --> 17:37.627
TELL ME YOU DIDN'T DRIVE.
I DI'INT.

17:37.627 --> 17:41.231
WELL,
THEN HOW'D YOU GET HOME?
(trash can rattling)

17:41.231 --> 17:42.632
(dog barks)
(sighs) BOBBY.

17:42.632 --> 17:46.496
(light jazz piano playing)

17:46.496 --> 17:48.498
HAVE I LOOKED AT THESE
LONG ENOUGH

17:48.498 --> 17:50.500
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE
THAT I CHECKED THEM OVER?

17:50.500 --> 17:53.643
I DIDN'T BRING
MY READING GLASSES.
VERY CONVINCING, SIR.

17:53.643 --> 17:56.376
EXCELLENT. LET'S SEAL THE DEAL
WITH A TOAST.

17:56.376 --> 18:00.150
UH, MR. FRANK, I NEED TO
CLEAR THE AIR ABOUT SOMETHING.

18:00.150 --> 18:02.212
I SAID
SOME REALLY MEAN THINGS

18:02.212 --> 18:05.155
ABOUT THE YOUNG WOMAN YOUR SON
IS SEEING, AND THEY AREN'T TRUE.

18:05.155 --> 18:08.218
LAURIE IS ACTUALLY A, UH,
A GREAT GIRL WITH A BIG HEART.

18:08.218 --> 18:10.860
AND YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
SMITH IS WITH HER.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.293
I'M WAITING
FOR THE PUNCH LINE.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.226
YEAH. UH, THERE--
THERE IS NO PUNCH LINE.

18:16.226 --> 18:20.170
BUT I CAN ONLY HOPE YOU'LL
RESPECT ME A LITTLE BIT MORE

18:20.170 --> 18:21.571
FOR BEING TRUTHFUL.

18:21.571 --> 18:25.235
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA LET ME
FINISH MY STEAK, ARE YA?
NO.

18:25.235 --> 18:27.137
COME ON!

18:27.137 --> 18:29.439
SORRY, DAD.
MOM'S GONNA CRUSH YOU.

18:29.439 --> 18:32.442
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, OKAY?
OUR DEAL STILL STANDS.

18:32.442 --> 18:34.484
YOU ALWAYS CALL
IF YOU NEED ME.

18:34.484 --> 18:37.247
THANK YOU.
(Jules) TRAVIS.

18:37.247 --> 18:39.249
I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR DAD.

18:39.249 --> 18:41.321
BOBBY, I CANNOT BELIEVE...

18:41.321 --> 18:43.523
(lowered voice) WE PULLED
THIS OFF! OH, MY GOD!

18:43.523 --> 18:45.625
(normal voice)
YOUR PLAN WORKED!

18:45.625 --> 18:48.698
I STICK TO MY RULE--DRINKING
EQUALS MASSIVE PUNISHMENT...

18:48.698 --> 18:52.202
BUT IF HE DOES DRINK, I DRIVE
HIM HOME, KEEP HIM ALIVE.

18:52.202 --> 18:55.205
WAIT, DOESN'T HE KNOW YOU'RE
ALWAYS GONNA RAT HIM OUT TO ME

18:55.205 --> 18:59.409
BEFORE YOU GO PICK HIM UP?
NOPE. HE THINKS I'M HIS BUDDY.
KID'S A DOPE. (laughs)

18:59.409 --> 19:01.271
BOBBY COBB, YOU'RE A GENIUS.

19:01.271 --> 19:04.274
HEY, THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
YOU CALLED ME A GENIUS

19:04.274 --> 19:06.916
WITHOUT BEING LIKE,
"WAY TO GO, GENIUS."

19:06.916 --> 19:08.918
WELL, I THINK
THAT THIS EVENT--

19:08.918 --> 19:10.920
LIKE ANY EVENT IN LIFE,
GOOD OR BAD--

19:10.920 --> 19:12.922
CALLS FOR A GLASS OF WINE.
OKAY?

19:12.922 --> 19:15.425
OOH, RAIN CHECK, J-BIRD.
I GOT PLANS.

19:15.425 --> 19:18.388
IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY,
FOR GOD SAKE.

19:18.388 --> 19:19.889
I FORGOT.

19:19.889 --> 19:22.892
(mutters)
"IT'S VALENTINE'S DAY." EH.

19:24.794 --> 19:28.167
I FELT SO BAD
THAT I GOT YOU THIS.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.940
IT'S GONNA GROW TO BE
EXACTLY LIKE YOUR OLD BUSH.

19:30.940 --> 19:32.942
YOU KNOW,
IN A THOUSAND YEARS.

19:32.942 --> 19:35.645
UNTIL THEN, JUST CONSIDER IT
A FRIENDLY REMINDER

19:35.645 --> 19:39.178
THAT IT'S JUST MUCH EASIER
TO DO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.310
THANK YOU.

19:40.310 --> 19:44.414
(gasps) OH!
I GOT YOU SOMETHING, TOO.

19:44.414 --> 19:45.715
(click)

19:45.715 --> 19:48.288
(Marching Band's
"Feel Good About It" playing)

19:48.288 --> 19:52.622
OH. YOU'RE PRETTY PROUD
OF YOURSELF, AREN'T YA?

19:52.622 --> 19:56.266
(Andy laughing)

19:56.266 --> 19:57.927
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

19:57.927 --> 20:00.430
в™Є WHEN YOU GONNA
STOP COMPLAINING в™Є

20:00.430 --> 20:04.374
в™Є START TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT? в™Є

20:04.374 --> 20:06.476
в™Є FROM THAT SWEEP,
MODERN PROPHETS... в™Є

20:06.476 --> 20:10.380
AW, LOOK AT THE SAD GIRL
WITH HER SILLY SWEATER.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.743
COME OUT HERE.
I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

20:13.743 --> 20:15.715
в™Є THERE IS SOMETHING BETTER в™Є

20:15.715 --> 20:17.547
MERRY VALENTINE'S DAY!

20:17.547 --> 20:21.651
LOOK WHAT YOU DID.
I FIGURED
IT WOULDN'T BE SO BAD

20:21.651 --> 20:23.653
TO SPEND TONIGHT
WITH A FEW FRIENDS.

20:23.653 --> 20:25.395
PLUS, ELLIE'S HERE.

20:25.395 --> 20:28.298
YOU'LL GET YOURS, MY FRIEND.
AND, YOU--
I AM SO SORRY I BLEW IT.

20:28.298 --> 20:31.461
I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.
DON'T TELL ANYONE.

20:31.461 --> 20:32.632
(mouths word)

20:32.632 --> 20:35.435
NOW WHO WANTS CHAMPAGNE?
(Travis) I DO.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.637
GET BACK IN YOUR ROOM,
TRAVIS.

20:37.637 --> 20:40.440
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.773
NO PROBLEM.

20:43.773 --> 20:47.747
в™Єв™Є

20:47.747 --> 20:49.749
(Jules laughs)

20:56.386 --> 20:58.388
OKAY, TIME TO GET REAL.

20:58.388 --> 21:00.930
YOU DON'T LIKE ME,
AND I DON'T LIKE YOU. CORRECT?
ABSOLUTELY.

21:00.930 --> 21:02.932
I DON'T LIKE HIM EITHER.

21:02.932 --> 21:05.935
SMITH, DON'T DISRESPECT
YOUR FATHER. IT'S NOT SEXY.

21:05.935 --> 21:07.697
WELL, IS THIS SEXY?

21:07.697 --> 21:09.268
WHAT?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.001
(gasps)
IT IS VALENTINE'S DAY, RIGHT?

21:12.001 --> 21:14.374
(gasps) SMITH! OH, MY GOD!

21:14.374 --> 21:16.446
NO! YOU...

21:16.446 --> 21:18.578
(strained voice) IT'S TIGHT.

21:18.578 --> 21:20.380
OH!
I... I... I CAN'T...

21:20.380 --> 21:22.682
I... (grunts)

21:22.682 --> 21:25.715
DAD? IT WAS--
IT WAS JUST A JOKE!

21:25.715 --> 21:27.757
I KNOW. SHE WARNED ME.

21:27.757 --> 21:30.460
(laughing)
AHH!

21:30.460 --> 21:32.692
WHY?
I THOUGHT
THIS WOULD BE FUNNIER.

21:32.692 --> 21:35.725
(laughs)
IT TOTALLY WAS!

21:35.725 --> 21:37.727
FIST POUND.
NAH. ARE YOU HUNGRY?
