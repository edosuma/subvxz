00:02.651 --> 00:05.486
I can't believe you've managed
to stay in this house.

00:05.487 --> 00:08.656
You're like
a human barnacle.

00:08.657 --> 00:10.124
Thanks, Mom.

00:10.125 --> 00:12.093
Oh, I wasn't putting
you down, sweetheart.

00:12.094 --> 00:14.629
It's good that you have a skill.

00:14.630 --> 00:16.597
Did you come over for a reason,
or just to insult me?

00:16.598 --> 00:19.467
The two aren't
mutually exclusive.

00:19.468 --> 00:20.601
Mom.

00:20.602 --> 00:22.603
Charlie's bank
contacted me.

00:22.604 --> 00:25.673
Seems he had a secret
safe deposit box.

00:25.674 --> 00:28.643
I knew it! I knew he had to
have something squirreled away.

00:28.766 --> 00:31.035
Naturally, I went right
down there to check it out.

00:31.037 --> 00:32.820
So what was in it? Cash?
Diamonds? Krugerrands?

00:32.822 --> 00:34.788
Want to wipe your mouth?
You're drooling a little.

00:34.790 --> 00:36.207
Sorry.

00:36.209 --> 00:38.742
Actually, I was quite surprised
about what was in there.

00:38.744 --> 00:41.212
- Oh, tell me, tell me!
- I'll do better than that.

00:41.214 --> 00:42.746
Here.

00:42.748 --> 00:45.132
I'm pretty sure he
wanted you to have this.

00:46.569 --> 00:47.801
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy...

00:47.803 --> 00:49.703
I knew you'd look out
for me, big bro.

00:49.705 --> 00:51.272
What the hell is this?

00:52.557 --> 00:53.807
Charlie's journal.

00:53.809 --> 00:54.975
Charlie kept a journal?

00:54.977 --> 00:57.544
Your brother was
a very complex man.

00:57.546 --> 00:59.813
Perhaps he needed a safe place

00:59.815 --> 01:02.816
to express his deepest emotions
and innermost thoughts,

01:02.818 --> 01:04.235
or some such nonsense.

01:05.770 --> 01:09.189
No. No cash, dear.
Already checked.

01:10.158 --> 01:11.442
Of course not.

01:11.444 --> 01:13.410
Why leave cash to your
impoverished brother

01:13.412 --> 01:16.664
when you can leave your
alcohol-muddled thoughts?

01:16.666 --> 01:18.365
Yay.

01:18.367 --> 01:21.285
"To whom it may concern,

01:21.287 --> 01:24.154
"if you are reading this it
means either my heart or lungs

01:24.156 --> 01:25.656
"finally gave out.

01:25.658 --> 01:27.658
"Or I rejected my new liver.

01:27.660 --> 01:31.828
"Or my brother wouldn't
give me a piece of his.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.847
"Or I choked on my own vomit,

01:33.849 --> 01:35.799
"or somebody else's.

01:35.801 --> 01:38.185
Or some crazy chick
pushed me in front of a bus..."

01:38.187 --> 01:40.003
Ooh, so close.

01:42.023 --> 01:46.343
Well, I hope reading it brings
you some comfort and closure.

01:46.345 --> 01:49.114
Are you sure that's all that
was in the safe deposit box?

01:49.115 --> 01:49.915
Yes.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.558
So my brother went
out to the bank

01:51.651 --> 01:54.034
and rented a safe deposit box
just for this journal?

01:54.036 --> 01:55.185
It would appear so.

01:55.187 --> 01:56.670
That makes no sense.

01:56.672 --> 01:58.322
He intimated on many occasions

01:58.324 --> 02:00.708
that he had some cash
stashed away for emergencies...

02:00.710 --> 02:04.328
you know, like getting
a hooker after an earthquake.

02:04.330 --> 02:08.132
Sweetheart, you have to
stop living in the past.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.967
What's done is done.

02:09.969 --> 02:11.852
Start looking forward.

02:11.854 --> 02:13.637
Yeah, I guess you're right.

02:13.639 --> 02:14.838
Is that a new watch?

02:14.840 --> 02:16.724
No.

02:16.726 --> 02:19.443
You have your whole
life ahead of you,

02:19.445 --> 02:23.447
and the fact is, you and I are
all that's left of this family.

02:23.449 --> 02:25.366
Well...

02:25.368 --> 02:27.151
you, me and Jake.

02:27.153 --> 02:29.169
Hey, Grandma.

02:30.406 --> 02:33.624
Whoa. Thought that was
coming out the other end.

02:36.077 --> 02:39.196
You're right.
It's just you and me.

02:39.198 --> 02:40.697
That looks like a man's Cartier.

02:40.699 --> 02:42.032
It's a knock-off.

02:43.168 --> 02:45.386
My point is,
with Charlie gone,

02:45.388 --> 02:48.172
you and I have to learn
how to help and support

02:48.174 --> 02:50.257
one another no matter what.

02:51.509 --> 02:54.228
Gee, that would be great.

02:54.230 --> 02:56.897
You were always
the good son.

02:58.016 --> 03:00.401
Now you're my only son.

03:01.603 --> 03:03.053
Oh, Mommy.

03:03.822 --> 03:06.023
Oh, Walden!
How nice to see you!

03:43.253 --> 03:45.704
I must tell you, Walden,
it's so nice to finally

03:45.706 --> 03:46.889
see someone in this house

03:46.891 --> 03:49.842
who surfs for something
other than porn.

03:49.844 --> 03:52.311
Yeah, I love the ocean.

03:52.313 --> 03:54.630
Just you alone with
your thoughts.

03:54.632 --> 03:58.250
Time standing still, at peace
with the entire universe.

03:58.252 --> 04:01.086
Plus, you can pee in it
and nobody knows.

04:01.088 --> 04:02.754
Charming.

04:02.756 --> 04:04.890
Actually, I'm glad
you stopped by.

04:04.892 --> 04:07.759
Um... Do you know a good
interior designer?

04:07.761 --> 04:11.614
As a matter of fact,
I know a great one.

04:14.267 --> 04:16.935
Evelyn Harper Interior Design.

04:16.937 --> 04:18.620
I thought you were
a real estate agent.

04:18.623 --> 04:21.072
I am. I'm also
a building inspector,

04:21.075 --> 04:24.210
mortgage broker, notary
public and a bail bondsman.

04:24.878 --> 04:26.245
A bail bondsman?

04:26.247 --> 04:29.548
Admittedly, that business has
slowed down since my son died.

04:29.550 --> 04:32.168
But getting back to your needs,

04:32.170 --> 04:35.137
what did you have in mind
in terms of redecorating?

04:35.139 --> 04:36.622
I don't know.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.508
I just, I just want my home
to reflect who I am.

04:39.510 --> 04:41.960
And who are you?

04:41.962 --> 04:45.964
I've got a buttload of money,
but I'm a pretty simple guy.

04:45.966 --> 04:49.735
I... like people, but
I don't entertain a lot.

04:49.737 --> 04:53.355
Oh, I'm not a neat freak,
but I don't like clutter.

04:53.357 --> 04:55.807
Oh, you know, and the most
important thing is,

04:55.809 --> 04:57.976
I want the house to use
green renewable energy,

04:57.978 --> 04:59.745
you know, like solar
power and wind power...

04:59.747 --> 05:01.947
Unless Brookstone or
somebody comes out with

05:01.949 --> 05:03.916
a home nuclear reactor,
because, I mean, come on,

05:03.918 --> 05:05.150
who wouldn't want one of those?

05:05.152 --> 05:08.954
"A buttload of money""

05:10.924 --> 05:12.341
You're in good hands.

05:16.463 --> 05:18.681
This journal is unbelievable.

05:18.683 --> 05:20.516
You aren't thinking of
publishing it, are you?

05:20.518 --> 05:22.768
What? Of course not, why?

05:22.770 --> 05:26.222
Well, I'm shoppin' around
my own Charlie memoir.

05:26.224 --> 05:29.508
It's called <i>Man Whore.</i>

05:29.510 --> 05:31.894
It's catchy.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.029
But there was more to
Charlie than we thought.

05:34.031 --> 05:35.197
I mean, listen to this.

05:35.199 --> 05:38.651
"I just sent a girl home
who told me she loved me

05:38.653 --> 05:40.569
"and I can't even
remember her name.

05:40.571 --> 05:42.488
"What is wrong with me
that I just have

05:42.490 --> 05:44.406
"anonymous drunken encounters
night after night?

05:44.408 --> 05:46.158
"Do I drink to fill
the loneliness,

05:46.160 --> 05:49.828
or to hide from the
horror I've become?"

05:49.830 --> 05:52.631
You know, I feel awful that
I lived with him for so long

05:52.633 --> 05:54.133
and I didn't recognize his pain.

05:55.635 --> 05:57.720
"I remember, her name is Rachel!

05:57.722 --> 05:59.922
"I feel better now.

06:02.192 --> 06:05.594
I'll reward myself with some
cocaine and an Asian hooker."

06:08.481 --> 06:11.233
So remember, the key to
balancing the equation

06:11.235 --> 06:13.269
is to place coefficients
in front of each reactant

06:13.271 --> 06:15.604
and product so that
all the atoms balance.

06:17.108 --> 06:19.825
I bet you shower every day.

06:21.561 --> 06:23.061
Jake, we're supposed
to be studying

06:23.063 --> 06:24.163
for the chemistry mid-term.

06:24.165 --> 06:26.332
I'd rather study our chemistry.

06:26.334 --> 06:28.250
Lame.

06:28.252 --> 06:31.287
Really? I thought it
was a "double intendo."

06:32.706 --> 06:34.256
Hey, guys.

06:34.258 --> 06:36.041
Whatcha studying?

06:36.043 --> 06:37.626
Chemistry.

06:37.628 --> 06:39.411
Cool.

06:39.413 --> 06:42.047
Looks like you two
have a little chemistry.

06:43.267 --> 06:44.967
That's so clever.

06:47.771 --> 06:49.271
I'm Megan.

06:49.273 --> 06:51.640
Oh, hi, Megan. It's nice
to meet you. I'm Walden.

06:51.642 --> 06:53.942
Oh, are you the Walden
that bought the house?

06:53.944 --> 06:56.395
Yeah, how many Waldens
have you met lately?

06:56.397 --> 06:58.930
That's... that's so funny.

06:58.932 --> 07:01.617
And I'm lame.

07:01.619 --> 07:03.935
Well, it was nice to meet you.

07:03.937 --> 07:07.105
I'll let you guys get
back to your "chemistry."

07:07.107 --> 07:09.658
Bye, Walden!
It was nice meeting you too.

07:11.277 --> 07:15.381
You know, if he hooks up
with you, he goes to jail.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.467
I'd wait for him.

07:23.840 --> 07:28.177
"Peed blood again this morning.

07:28.179 --> 07:30.796
<i>Should I be worried?"</i>

07:31.297 --> 07:33.465
As it turns out, no.

07:39.522 --> 07:43.242
We have to get
rid of Walden.

07:43.244 --> 07:46.144
- We do?
- Oh yeah, he's gotta go.

07:46.146 --> 07:48.330
Does it occur to you
that this is his house

07:48.332 --> 07:50.733
and if anybody goes,
it's gonna be us?

07:50.735 --> 07:53.352
Actually, no.

07:53.354 --> 07:54.920
What's the problem?

07:54.922 --> 07:56.789
He's stealing my girlfriend.

07:56.791 --> 07:58.490
Wait, I thought
she was your tutor.

07:58.492 --> 08:00.793
Think about it, Dad.
Would I have asked for a tutor

08:00.795 --> 08:03.829
if I didn't have a... what do
you call it, interior motive?

08:09.569 --> 08:12.020
Go on.

08:12.022 --> 08:14.723
She's only interested in
glomming onto Walden.

08:14.725 --> 08:16.341
Well, if it makes
you feel any better,

08:16.343 --> 08:18.861
I think my own mother likes
him more than she likes me.

08:18.863 --> 08:21.063
Why would that
make me feel better?

08:22.899 --> 08:25.434
I honestly don't know.

08:27.438 --> 08:29.722
Is this what I have to
look forward to in life?

08:29.724 --> 08:31.590
Always losing girls to
smarter, better-looking men?

08:31.592 --> 08:33.125
Well, think of it this way:

08:33.126 --> 08:35.309
you're carrying on a
proud family tradition.

08:39.631 --> 08:40.948
Hello, dear.

08:40.951 --> 08:42.301
What's all this?

08:42.303 --> 08:43.302
Oh, didn't you know?

08:43.304 --> 08:46.255
I'm helping young
Thor redecorate.

08:46.257 --> 08:48.590
I hope that's
all you're doing.

08:48.592 --> 08:50.259
Whatever do you mean?

08:50.261 --> 08:52.210
He's tall, he's handsome,
he's vulnerable,

08:52.212 --> 08:54.096
and you're old enough
to be his ancestor.

08:55.231 --> 08:57.215
Relax, Alan.
The only thing I want

08:57.217 --> 08:59.651
to pull out of that boy's
pants is his wallet.

08:59.653 --> 09:01.019
You sure?

09:01.021 --> 09:04.273
Believe me, I have
no ulterior motive.

09:04.275 --> 09:06.575
I believe that's
"interior," Grandma.

09:08.161 --> 09:12.748
You really should get that boy a
unicycle and some juggling pins.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.583
Evelyn, cool, you're here.
Uh, could you come on up?

09:14.585 --> 09:16.752
There's some things I want
you to do in my bedroom.

09:18.171 --> 09:21.089
Give the customer
what he wants.

09:24.277 --> 09:27.429
Okay, to start with,

09:27.431 --> 09:30.582
I want grey Carrara
marble counters,

09:30.584 --> 09:31.917
a steam shower...

09:31.919 --> 09:35.187
oh, and can we get one of
those fancy Japanese toilets

09:35.189 --> 09:37.306
that sprays water and
cleans your tushie?

09:37.308 --> 09:38.557
With your money you could afford

09:38.559 --> 09:40.976
an actual Japanese
person to do it.

09:40.978 --> 09:43.729
See what you can find.

09:43.731 --> 09:46.899
Okay, in here, I would like
to replace the bed frame,

09:46.901 --> 09:48.867
the curtains, the dresser,

09:48.869 --> 09:50.369
the end tables and the lamps.

09:50.371 --> 09:51.587
All right.

09:51.589 --> 09:53.672
What would you like
to replace them with?

09:53.674 --> 09:55.424
Um...

09:55.426 --> 09:57.176
A cooler bed frame,

09:57.178 --> 09:59.211
cooler curtains, cooler dresser,

09:59.213 --> 10:01.964
cooler end tables
and cooler lamps.

10:01.966 --> 10:05.300
"Cooler." I'm on it.

10:05.302 --> 10:07.452
Uh, now, would you
like to repaint?

10:07.454 --> 10:09.221
Hey, can I have walls

10:09.223 --> 10:11.423
that change color
depending on my mood?

10:11.425 --> 10:13.458
No.

10:13.460 --> 10:14.793
But we could paint them white

10:14.795 --> 10:17.128
and get you an industrial
strength antidepressant.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.130
That will work too.

10:19.132 --> 10:20.849
Would you like to
keep the camera?

10:20.851 --> 10:22.784
What camera?

10:25.955 --> 10:27.523
Aw...

10:27.525 --> 10:29.140
Awesome!

10:29.142 --> 10:31.977
I'm on TV.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.245
Hello!

10:33.247 --> 10:36.147
I am so keeping that.

10:36.149 --> 10:37.950
All right. Anything else?

10:37.952 --> 10:41.587
Can I have a Jacuzzi
on the balcony?

10:41.589 --> 10:43.655
'Cause I'm single now,
so I'm going to be

10:43.657 --> 10:47.492
having sex with a lot of
women I haven't met yet.

10:47.494 --> 10:51.213
Oh... I just got an idea!

10:51.215 --> 10:56.051
Just out of curiosity, what kind
of woman are you attracted to?

10:56.053 --> 10:58.003
There's my wife.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.338
Oh, and there's women
who look like my wife.

11:00.340 --> 11:01.807
That's very romantic.

11:01.809 --> 11:03.475
Oh, and Ellen DeGeneres.

11:03.477 --> 11:04.776
I don't know
what it is.

11:04.778 --> 11:06.361
Whether it's the slacks
or the way she dances--

11:06.363 --> 11:08.030
it's hot.

11:08.032 --> 11:10.282
♪ Men. ♪

11:13.630 --> 11:15.446
♪ Men. ♪

11:17.783 --> 11:19.217
You're up early.

11:19.219 --> 11:21.386
Charlie's journal-- I
can't stop reading it.

11:21.388 --> 11:22.587
Listen to this.

11:22.589 --> 11:24.589
"My brother's kid
showed up today.

11:24.591 --> 11:26.090
"He's kind of cute.

11:26.092 --> 11:28.209
"No way he's really Alan's kid.

11:29.912 --> 11:32.313
"And best of all,
he's smart as a whip.

11:32.315 --> 11:35.516
I think he's got
a very bright future."

11:35.518 --> 11:38.353
Oh, that just
breaks my heart.

11:38.355 --> 11:39.487
Yeah.

11:39.489 --> 11:41.739
We were all so young
and naive then.

11:41.741 --> 11:42.907
Hey.

11:42.909 --> 11:45.810
Hey.

11:52.334 --> 11:54.585
What? I took a huge dump.

11:57.990 --> 12:00.758
No way he's really my kid.

12:05.998 --> 12:07.598
You look very pretty today.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.867
Jake, I'm here
to study.

12:09.869 --> 12:11.369
The test was yesterday.

12:11.371 --> 12:14.188
I already failed.

12:14.190 --> 12:15.289
Hey, guys.

12:15.291 --> 12:17.358
Hey, Walden.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.509
Here we go.

12:18.511 --> 12:22.613
Whoa, Megan,
you look very pretty today.

12:22.615 --> 12:23.848
Thanks.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.450
You look pretty, too.

12:26.869 --> 12:28.519
Thank you.

12:28.521 --> 12:29.854
Where are you going?

12:29.856 --> 12:33.207
Oh, I am going furniture
shopping with Jake's grandma.

12:33.209 --> 12:35.410
Oh, I love furniture.

12:36.545 --> 12:39.530
And grandmas.

12:39.532 --> 12:40.865
Cool.

12:42.251 --> 12:43.584
See ya.

12:43.586 --> 12:46.203
See ya.

12:46.205 --> 12:47.555
Okay, Megan,

12:47.557 --> 12:48.756
I know what's going on here

12:48.758 --> 12:50.842
and I really don't appreciate...

12:53.045 --> 12:54.145
What's that about?

12:54.147 --> 12:56.314
I don't know. I'm
just in the mood.

12:56.316 --> 12:57.515
Okay.

12:59.568 --> 13:01.052
Come on.

13:01.054 --> 13:02.570
Okay.

13:02.572 --> 13:03.604
Where are we going?

13:03.606 --> 13:04.906
To your room.

13:04.908 --> 13:07.108
Okay.

13:08.994 --> 13:12.396
Hello, gorgeous.

13:12.398 --> 13:14.415
Did you miss me?

13:14.417 --> 13:16.701
'Cause I sure missed you.

13:16.703 --> 13:19.954
Let me pull this thing
out of you.

13:31.201 --> 13:34.135
Are you gonna turn your car off?

13:36.473 --> 13:39.256
I did.

13:41.110 --> 13:43.194
Might need service.

13:43.196 --> 13:45.780
Sadly, that's where
I just came from.

13:49.936 --> 13:52.820
You know what's great
about my electric car?

13:52.822 --> 13:54.238
What?

13:55.208 --> 13:56.541
I just turned it on.

13:56.543 --> 13:58.309
Sweet.

13:58.311 --> 13:59.977
So where you headed?

13:59.979 --> 14:01.662
Um, I'm going
to pick up your mom.

14:01.664 --> 14:02.997
We're going furniture shopping.

14:02.999 --> 14:04.949
Okay, well, just
a little heads up

14:04.951 --> 14:07.952
before you journey to
the caves of Mordor.

14:07.954 --> 14:09.720
My mother has what
you might call

14:09.722 --> 14:12.173
a, uh, proclivity
for younger men.

14:12.175 --> 14:13.457
You mean she's like a cougar?

14:13.459 --> 14:15.459
No, she's not
"like a cougar""

14:15.461 --> 14:16.844
she's the mother
of all cougars.

14:16.846 --> 14:19.797
So kind of an uber-cougar?

14:19.799 --> 14:22.016
A super duper
uber-cougar.

14:22.018 --> 14:23.651
You think a bit of better butter

14:23.653 --> 14:25.853
would make
her bitter batter better?

14:25.855 --> 14:27.889
What?

14:27.891 --> 14:30.108
I just like saying that.

14:30.110 --> 14:31.459
Walden, I'm
serious here.

14:31.461 --> 14:33.027
Don't worry.

14:33.029 --> 14:34.662
I'm not going to hook up
with your mom.

14:34.664 --> 14:37.148
Yeah, if I had a dime for
every time I heard that,

14:37.150 --> 14:39.333
I'd have $3.60.

14:40.452 --> 14:42.537
And I know that doesn't
sound like a lot,

14:42.539 --> 14:44.956
but it is 36 times.

14:44.958 --> 14:47.909
That's a very weird thing
to keep track of.

14:47.911 --> 14:49.844
I got a lot
of free time.

14:49.846 --> 14:53.297
Trust me,
nothing's going to happen.

14:53.299 --> 14:56.167
Okay. But try not to
hurt her feelings.

14:56.169 --> 14:58.352
I mean, she may be a rapacious
sexual predator,

14:58.354 --> 15:00.721
but she breaks
just like a little girl.

15:00.723 --> 15:02.056
Understood.

15:02.058 --> 15:04.175
Oh, hey, check it out.

15:04.177 --> 15:06.277
I got voice control.

15:06.279 --> 15:07.862
Lights on.

15:09.848 --> 15:11.449
Radio on.

15:14.187 --> 15:15.870
Back up.

15:18.373 --> 15:20.374
Bye!

15:27.332 --> 15:31.202
Well, you may not be
pretty or expensive,

15:31.204 --> 15:33.804
but you get me
where I want to go.

15:38.393 --> 15:40.261
Thank you for walking
me to my door.

15:40.263 --> 15:42.146
You don't meet many
gentlemen nowadays.

15:42.148 --> 15:43.231
You're welcome.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.365
Is that a camera?

15:44.367 --> 15:46.317
Hello!

15:46.319 --> 15:49.353
Would you like to come in
for a drink before you go?

15:49.355 --> 15:52.106
I don't know,
I should probably get going.

15:52.108 --> 15:53.157
What's your hurry?

15:53.159 --> 15:54.775
I just think that

15:54.777 --> 15:56.777
we should keep
our relationship business

15:56.779 --> 15:59.947
and not "biznass."

15:59.949 --> 16:03.400
Oh, my goodness,
do you think I'm hitting on you?

16:04.453 --> 16:08.206
W-Well, Alan did say
that you're an uber-cougar.

16:08.208 --> 16:10.424
An uber-cougar?

16:10.426 --> 16:12.927
A super duper uber-cougar.

16:15.465 --> 16:17.298
Oh, my Lord.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.517
Now, you listen to me,
young man.

16:19.519 --> 16:22.520
My son has some serious issues.

16:22.522 --> 16:24.639
And he tends to imagine things.

16:24.641 --> 16:29.477
Believe me, I have no carnal
designs on you whatsoever.

16:29.479 --> 16:31.145
Really?

16:31.147 --> 16:35.116
For God's sake, Walden, I'm old
enough to be your mother.

16:35.118 --> 16:38.435
Assuming a teenage pregnancy
of course.

16:38.437 --> 16:40.738
Okay, sure.

16:40.740 --> 16:42.940
I'll have a drink.

16:55.621 --> 16:57.805
Are you going to tell Alan?

17:00.225 --> 17:03.961
I'm going to tell everyone.

with my mom?

18:11.692 --> 18:14.242
Fine, fine.

18:14.244 --> 18:16.544
Just shopped for furniture.
