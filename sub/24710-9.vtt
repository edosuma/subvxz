13:37.608 --> 13:41.445
Jill, if you want,
we'll walk Kyle out the door,

13:41.695 --> 13:44.740
and no one will ever see his name
in a single piece of paperwork

13:44.824 --> 13:45.991
connected with this case.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.244
I want the case made.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.498
I just pray that Kyle doesn't have
to go through more.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.751
All right.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.148
She's supposed to be worried for him.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.819
We need a confession in this case.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.530
Yeah, a confession would be good.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.688
whatever benefit you're getting
from organizing your thoughts

14:57.813 --> 15:00.065
cannot outweigh the negative impression
you are making by being late.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.443
I want certain things
understood downstairs.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.320
This is not the time
to be making conditions.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.572
It is also not the time
for anyone in that squad

15:06.739 --> 15:09.491
to be looking strange at me
or down their nose.

if he didn't want this to work out.

Just ask him, write yes or no.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.344
What are you talking about?

15:28.802 --> 15:31.513

ask him to write yes or no.

three different nights

15:49.114 --> 15:51.367
or the... smart-ass in front of me now?

15:52.368 --> 15:53.994
Someone called you at home,
said she was me?

15:54.078 --> 15:57.623
Called, told me she was doing things
she didn't want to and didn't understand,

15:57.748 --> 15:59.124
that her life was spinning out of control

15:59.375 --> 16:03.003

that would mean she could help herself.

What's the crime in that?

-Sure.

at that oil drum fire

we get goin' outside the garage
on Lafayette.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.376
-Who can back that?
-Because of the cold.

18:07.002 --> 18:08.754
Yeah, it's gotten very chilly.

-Yeah, good.

We're gonna take a ride over
to Lafayette later, Ed.

be able to back your story.

If that was the night
that we had the fire.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.904
When did you last see Vic Frawley?

18:34.196 --> 18:38.283
Look, he took my can route,
but I didn't kill him.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.247
-Was it Vic that beat on your head?
-Many people beat on me.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.750
The story we're hearing is Vic beat
on you takin' over your can territory.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.503
Him coming up dead,
we gotta look at you as having a motive.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.297
If we take your sweatshirt
to your lab, Ed,

18:52.631 --> 18:56.051
and it comes up positive for Vic's blood,
you're facin' a murder charge.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.180
Ed, if you did somethin' to Vic...
maybe completely justifiable.

Over him bullying you off your can route,
the time to say so is now,

19:04.226 --> 19:05.769

paints you into a corner

to keep him company,

Now, what you can do for Mom is...

19:59.573 --> 20:01.992
No. Honey, I don't want you down here

in your commissary account

and here inside.

and what was early the next morning.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.804

23:09.679 --> 23:13.350

Freddie Asuncion did
what he felt he had to

23:20.565 --> 23:21.817
to Genero Lopez.

23:22.818 --> 23:23.819
He killed him.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.156
Freddie then looked to Juan Suarez,

23:28.573 --> 23:30.867
a timid youth,
who was searching for respect

23:30.992 --> 23:33.662
After Genero brained
his brother with a crowbar.

23:34.079 --> 23:38.834
Juan was afraid to take his revenge,
but then Freddie offered him

23:38.917 --> 23:41.128
a monthly amount of money
for his wife

23:42.045 --> 23:44.047
if Juan admitted to the killing.

23:44.506 --> 23:49.010
And, by searching for respect...
Juan agreed.

he wants to bang your wife
instead of paying her quiet money...

27:16.009 --> 27:19.763
-Everything you got on Vince.
-I will. I will!

27:26.645 --> 27:30.607
Look... We... we'll talk about it tonight.
I gotta go.

27:33.735 --> 27:37.447
Hey, Greg, the DOA's blood
don't match the blood on Ed's sweatshirt.

27:37.822 --> 27:39.240
Oh. Good.

27:39.949 --> 27:44.704
Because God forbid we should be spared
interviewing 50 more lice-infested bums.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.918
-Annie?
-GREG: Annie couldn't give her notice.

27:50.293 --> 27:55.090
Her boss is laid low by an allergy attack.
I'd like him laid low by a bus.

-(EXHALES)

28:30.542 --> 28:31.751
Sorry we're late.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.587
What'd you find out?

28:37.507 --> 28:38.883
Freddie Asuncion.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.804
Did the murder Suarez copped to, or...

28:43.096 --> 28:44.806
Had Suarez killed in prison?

28:45.265 --> 28:47.934
-Both.
-(ANDY SIGHS)

28:48.184 --> 28:50.061
This is not about finger pointing.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.772
Suarez was a convicted murderer,

28:53.398 --> 28:56.234
and naming Asuncion in a letter
from prison was not enough to go on.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.444
We got a guy to flip.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.655
-Deals dope for Asuncion?
-Yeah.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.074
-Tommy Ibarra.
-He's in custody?

29:04.993 --> 29:08.079
Nope. We have to put him in custody.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.544
I hope she wasn't proposing
no vigilante tactics

29:14.627 --> 29:17.756
-on the ride back from Rikers.
-I'll take care of the tactics.

that filed the complaint...

29:38.318 --> 29:41.863
-The woman whose car you sideswiped...
-I did not sideswipe her car.

29:42.071 --> 29:44.657
That your buddy John sideswiped her car.

29:44.991 --> 29:47.327
What's John wanna
involve me with that for?

29:47.494 --> 29:48.912
We asked him to involve you, Vince,

29:48.995 --> 29:51.039
because this Dorothy Natale,
whose car John hit,

29:51.247 --> 29:52.957
has been breaking balls all day.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.419
We got half an idea
she's building some insurance case.

29:56.711 --> 29:58.797
That's on us,
Vince asking John for your name.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.716
We asked him was there someone
who could corroborate

30:02.050 --> 30:03.635
he only did minimal damage.

30:04.385 --> 30:07.222
(CHUCKLES) Yeah... Yeah. Minimal damage.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.724
He only minimally damaged her car?

30:11.100 --> 30:13.061
Uh, a minor sideswipe.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.230
John said you got fired today.

30:16.272 --> 30:19.234
-I was fired, yeah.
-Will that jam up your parole?

30:19.943 --> 30:24.364
-No. I wouldn't assume so.
-Who's your PO, Mother Teresa?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.035
I mean, maybe it will jam me up.
I don't know.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.621
-Not your problem, right?
-What?

30:31.996 --> 30:34.624
If I get jammed up on my parole,
it's not really your problem.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.543
Account for your day.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.169
What does my day have to do

30:38.253 --> 30:41.005
with John Falcone sideswiping
some ball-breaking bitch

30:41.089 --> 30:42.632
looking to earn on a fender bender?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.926
If I ask you to account
for your day, scumbag,

30:45.093 --> 30:46.427
start accounting for your day.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.305
Woke up about 7:15...

30:49.389 --> 30:51.140
What were you doing
just before you hit that lady?

30:51.224 --> 30:54.519
-Heh, I didn't hit that lady.
-No. You killed that store clerk.

30:56.437 --> 30:57.438
What?

30:57.564 --> 31:00.400
Just before your buddy John,
sideswiped that lady's car,

31:00.483 --> 31:02.694
driving fast like you told him to,

31:02.944 --> 31:04.571
you pulled a knife
in that convenience store

31:05.029 --> 31:06.656
and put it in that store clerk's chest.

31:07.657 --> 31:08.825
He was not there.

31:08.992 --> 31:12.078
-If he told you he was, he lied.
-The store clerk's dead, Vince.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.790
-We're gonna lock you up for murder.
-John was not in that store.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.543
Two other people were, Vince.
A man and his wife,

31:18.751 --> 31:21.796
and after John gave us your name
and we got your photo from BCI,

31:22.005 --> 31:23.464
them two people picked you out.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.758
There was not a man
and a wife in that store.

31:25.842 --> 31:27.427
I guess that means you were.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.304
Who said I wasn't?

31:29.762 --> 31:32.056
Look, I purchased my smokes
and then walked out.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.017
John putting me in that store

31:34.142 --> 31:36.436
does not make me guilty
of murder or anything.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.899
-And you're making them two people up.
-Was there a little boy in that store?

31:42.775 --> 31:43.943
What's this now?

31:44.736 --> 31:47.030
Was there a little boy saw
you stick the store clerk

31:47.196 --> 31:49.198
before the clerk even had a chance
to give you the money

31:49.324 --> 31:51.576
-or lottery tickets you wanted?
-(SCOFFS)

31:51.826 --> 31:53.786
Did you point your finger
at that little boy

31:53.870 --> 31:56.664
to threaten and intimidate him
before you ran out?

31:56.789 --> 31:58.333
He's got me confused with somebody else.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.002
No. He saw you,
and you're getting locked up.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.798
But the best luck you've had
in your sorry life, Vince,

32:06.299 --> 32:08.384
we don't want that boy
to have to testify.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.512
So if you cooperate
by giving us a statement,

32:11.971 --> 32:14.641
I'll personally guarantee
I'll go to bat for you.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.435
And Detective Russell will also.

32:19.270 --> 32:22.690
If you and the clerk had some prior
back-and-forth that little boy didn't see,

32:23.107 --> 32:24.233
we will go to bat for that.

32:24.484 --> 32:28.363
If he provoked you some way,
disrespected your purpose being there.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.324
We know a lot of situations,
a guy only shows a knife

32:31.616 --> 32:33.201
to let the clerk know he's serious.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.996
Now, the clerk insults him some way,
tells him to shove the knife up his ass...

32:37.288 --> 32:40.833
The whole picture changes
behind the clerk's provocation.

32:43.920 --> 32:47.256
And now, here's the alternative, Vince.
If you do not make a statement,

32:48.091 --> 32:50.551
knowing we've got an eyewitness
to what you did inside,

32:50.677 --> 32:53.179
and your buddy John corroborating
you were there,

32:53.429 --> 32:55.723
you make us put that little boy on,

32:56.099 --> 32:58.851
Detective Russell and me,
we'll take a vow in this room

32:58.935 --> 33:00.228
that we will crucify you.

33:00.520 --> 33:02.480
I got a lot of friends
in the district attorney's office,

33:02.605 --> 33:04.190
and so does Detective Sorenson,

33:04.691 --> 33:09.779
and we will call in every favor we're owed
to make this a death penalty case.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.824
Give it up, Vince. Tell us your side.

33:18.705 --> 33:19.706
