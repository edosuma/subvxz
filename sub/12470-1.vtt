<i>Recruit, welcome to the call up.</i>

04:12.959 --> 04:16.149
<i>Report to the 25th floor.</i>

04:41.525 --> 04:43.650
Is this it?

04:43.750 --> 04:46.150
<i>Floor 25.</i>

04:49.484 --> 04:51.775
Oh, here they are.

04:54.734 --> 04:59.442
- Yo. You're late, man.
- I... yeah, sorry. I...

04:59.775 --> 05:02.342
- Are you in charge?
- No.

05:02.442 --> 05:04.984
We know as much as you do. Or as little.

05:05.084 --> 05:07.734
<i>Recruits, welcome to Beta Testing.</i>

05:07.859 --> 05:11.484
<i>Please sign in on the tablets provided.</i>

05:15.067 --> 05:18.359
- So where are you from?
- From Bosnia.

05:18.459 --> 05:22.134
I am from Sarajevo... it's in Europe.

05:22.234 --> 05:25.359
<i>Please locate your individual locker.</i>

05:25.459 --> 05:30.109
<i>Deposit all valuables
and electronic devices.</i>

05:33.359 --> 05:37.984
<i>Please put on the motion-capture
suits provided.</i>

05:41.192 --> 05:44.092
Do they really expect us to wear these?

05:44.192 --> 05:47.650
What's the matter, bitch tits?
You need a bra with that?

05:55.525 --> 05:59.775
- Why Sox?
- It's my girlfriend's cat.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.484
That's cute.

06:03.734 --> 06:05.900
So, this is awkward.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.342
It's okay, I work in a hospital.

06:12.442 --> 06:15.942
And there is no modesty
in sickness, either.

06:26.650 --> 06:28.359
Do you work out much?

06:28.484 --> 06:30.900
Are you kidding? I live in the gym, man.

06:31.025 --> 06:33.300
- Basic training.
- You're a soldier.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.942
- Artillery. Middle east.
- <i>The call up is about to begin.</i>

06:37.042 --> 06:40.859

Let's go.

06:59.984 --> 07:04.650
<i>Please, step onto the scanner
and state your gamer tag.</i>

07:21.025 --> 07:23.067
- <i>Name?</i>
- Atlas.

07:23.192 --> 07:27.609
<i>Welcome, Atlas.
Please, collect your equipment.</i>

07:48.859 --> 07:52.442
- <i>Name?</i>
- Reaper 2000.

07:55.525 --> 07:58.442
Wait, you haven't heard of me? Seriously?

07:58.542 --> 08:00.317
But...

08:00.734 --> 08:05.984
<i>Welcome, Reaper 2000.
Please collect your equipment.</i>

08:12.567 --> 08:14.359
- <i>Name?</i>
- Straight Shooter.

08:14.484 --> 08:16.525
<i>Welcome, Straight Shooter.</i>

08:16.650 --> 08:20.025
Jesus, this is some pretty fancy shit.

08:20.150 --> 08:22.592
Interactive gaming units.

08:22.692 --> 08:25.234
I've read about stuff like this.

08:25.334 --> 08:27.775
Full immersion technologies.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.109
Bubble play.

08:30.609 --> 08:33.025
I thought this would only be for elites.

08:33.150 --> 08:36.525
I don't recognize any of you
from the leader boards.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.859
- You ever seen anything like this before?
- <i>Please put on your gaming suits.</i>

08:39.984 --> 08:43.025
<i>The polymer matrix composite armor
has been developed</i>

08:43.125 --> 08:45.734
<i>to give the most advanced haptic feedback.</i>

08:45.859 --> 08:50.900
<i>54 individually calibrated vibration points
are located within the suit</i>

08:51.025 --> 08:55.359
<i>to provide the closest possible
experience to modern warfare.</i>

08:55.459 --> 08:59.109
<i>The helmet secures itself via neck...</i>

08:59.209 --> 09:01.467
<i>chin and jaw</i>

09:01.567 --> 09:05.175
<i>to ensure your safety during the game.</i>

09:05.275 --> 09:09.859
<i>Training cannot commence
until all players are equipped.</i>

09:10.692 --> 09:12.025
What?

09:12.484 --> 09:14.525
I'm not playing in this.

09:15.650 --> 09:18.150
What's your problem, guy?

09:20.484 --> 09:24.859
- Is that not your gamer tag, Terrorist One?
- It was supposed to be ironic.

09:24.984 --> 09:27.192
I get it.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.984
<i>Training cannot commence
until all players are equipped.</i>

09:31.084 --> 09:34.192
What's up with this guy? What's he doing?

09:37.442 --> 09:39.984
Look, this guy doesn't want to play.
Can somebody let him out?

09:40.084 --> 09:41.859
Open the door, please!

09:41.959 --> 09:44.650
Would they really lock us in?

09:46.150 --> 09:48.234
Open the door before I kick it down!

09:48.359 --> 09:51.609
Excuse me, dumbass.
You mind quit wasting everybody's time?

09:51.709 --> 09:53.900
You chose the name, right?

09:54.025 --> 09:57.984
So suit up and shut up, man.
Get on with the game.

09:58.359 --> 10:02.442
- What's your real name?
- We can't use real names.

10:02.734 --> 10:05.317
- Zahid.
- Zahid.

10:05.984 --> 10:08.342
Well, if none of us care,
does it really matter?

10:08.442 --> 10:10.859
- We all know what you meant.
- It's the principle.

10:10.959 --> 10:15.025
Come on. How bad can it really be?

10:18.900 --> 10:23.650
<i>Recruits, lower your visors.
Begin training module.</i>

10:53.776 --> 10:55.776
It's amazing.

11:06.276 --> 11:08.776
This takes me back.

11:38.359 --> 11:40.692
This is unbelievable.

11:55.026 --> 11:57.276
What do you think?

11:57.984 --> 12:01.067
I am thinking it was a big mistake.

12:01.859 --> 12:05.234
- What do you mean?
- Hey... my tattoos are gone.

12:06.192 --> 12:10.276
- Is this even possible?
- A 110 degree micro-light plasma,

12:10.376 --> 12:13.901
with added depth perception
and periphery coverage.

12:14.526 --> 12:18.151
The speakers are fricking awesome!

12:18.526 --> 12:21.067
It's a computer screen?

12:21.192 --> 12:23.342
Simply put.

12:23.442 --> 12:27.234
It's like I died and went to gamer heaven.

12:28.734 --> 12:32.442
What do you say now, Terrorist?
You still don't wanna play the game?

12:32.734 --> 12:36.176
Ten hut!

12:36.276 --> 12:40.234
Recruits, fall in!

12:40.734 --> 12:42.776
No way.

12:43.109 --> 12:45.151
Hey, go on.

12:59.192 --> 13:03.842
Stand up straight,
you sorry looking motherfuckers.

13:03.942 --> 13:06.859
You will shut your cake-hole,
private fuck nuts.

13:06.984 --> 13:10.984
- Do you understand me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

13:23.026 --> 13:27.067
- Outstanding.
- Totally had me fooled.

13:29.192 --> 13:32.442
Follow me, maggots.

13:45.567 --> 13:49.984
Alpha Company, collect your weapons.

13:59.859 --> 14:02.817
Excellent... Sig-Sauer.

14:16.192 --> 14:19.651
This is your new best friend.

14:26.109 --> 14:28.151
Fire at will.

14:33.109 --> 14:34.901
Oh, yeah.

14:39.442 --> 14:42.817
The recoil... everything. It's so real.

14:44.901 --> 14:47.984
- It's just like the real thing.
- It can't be like that.

14:50.442 --> 14:53.317
Bullshit, man,
this ain't calibrated right.

14:54.609 --> 14:57.109
That's right, bitches.

14:59.151 --> 15:03.151
All recruits must test their weapons.

15:19.526 --> 15:22.776
- I'm sorry.
- That was good.

15:23.359 --> 15:27.109
- Come on.
- Pay attention, maggots!

15:31.317 --> 15:34.109
If you get hit...

15:34.817 --> 15:39.109
first shot, it will cost you your armor.

15:41.026 --> 15:43.817
- Shit!
- Oh, my God!

15:44.901 --> 15:49.276
- Are you all right?
- Shit, man. This is hilarious. You see...

15:50.359 --> 15:53.526
- Oh, my God.
- Are you all right?

15:53.651 --> 15:55.484
Yeah.

15:56.359 --> 15:59.092
It's not so bad, right?

15:59.192 --> 16:02.067
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

16:02.817 --> 16:05.817
- What the...?
- You start the game...

16:05.917 --> 16:07.984
...with one flak jacket.

16:08.084 --> 16:11.967
Lose it... and you'll need one of these.

16:12.067 --> 16:17.176
Keep your eyes peeled. These things
are rare as rocking horse shit.

16:17.276 --> 16:19.776
Without one, you'll be in a world of pain.

16:20.109 --> 16:22.317
Recruits...

16:22.442 --> 16:27.442
the building has been overrun
by highly trained terrorists.

16:27.984 --> 16:30.609
Your job is to take them out...

16:30.709 --> 16:34.526
as you make your way to the ground floor.

16:34.651 --> 16:37.151
The gamer with the highest score wins.

16:37.276 --> 16:39.734
$100,000.

16:45.859 --> 16:49.859
Now, move out!

16:50.359 --> 16:57.067
<i>The call up will begin in five,
four, three, two, one.</i>

16:57.192 --> 17:01.234
Looks like it's show time.
Lock and load, people.

17:03.859 --> 17:06.759
No loud noises or sudden movements.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.067
We're all prey out here now until we
figure out what the hell's going on.

17:10.192 --> 17:14.026
- That fucking hurt.
- Stay together, and remember...

17:14.126 --> 17:17.401
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

17:17.526 --> 17:19.901
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

18:24.068 --> 18:27.651
- What are we even supposed to be doing?
- Nice of you ladies to finally join us.

18:28.484 --> 18:29.984
Get down!

18:35.484 --> 18:37.318
Damn.

18:40.568 --> 18:42.026
Look at this.

18:43.109 --> 18:45.484
Got him.

18:49.068 --> 18:50.526
- You all right?
- Yeah.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.568
Yeah? Here.

18:57.734 --> 19:00.068
Good reflexes.

19:00.193 --> 19:03.359
- Cat-like.
- Yeah.

19:03.484 --> 19:08.693
<i>Level 25 complete.
High score, Straight Shooter.</i>

19:19.943 --> 19:23.551
So that's it? He kills one terrorist
and he gets all the points?

19:23.651 --> 19:27.068
This is entry level, man.
I'm pretty sure it's gonna get harder.

19:27.193 --> 19:29.843
Motherfucker.
I mean, they got AK's, you know.

19:29.943 --> 19:33.526
- All we got is these shitty pistols.
- What was he supposed to be?

19:33.651 --> 19:37.426
He's a... Russian, I think. Right?
Like eastern European?

19:37.526 --> 19:40.526
- At least they're not Muslim.
- I think I'm going to be sick.

19:40.626 --> 19:44.026
<i>Please proceed to the next level.</i>

19:44.401 --> 19:46.276
Let's move out.

19:59.026 --> 20:03.901
<i>Access to lower level denied
until current level completed.</i>

20:07.859 --> 20:09.901
Road block.

20:10.026 --> 20:12.526
There's no way down. We head through here.

20:12.651 --> 20:15.109
Stay close to the wall.

20:18.943 --> 20:22.943
You okay? Come on. Come on.

20:36.359 --> 20:41.359
<i>Floor 24. Please collect your weapons.</i>

20:42.318 --> 20:46.568
- Must be some kind of supply station.
- Do they have any ammo? I'm out.

20:49.693 --> 20:52.026
Bingo, man!

20:52.151 --> 20:55.318
- Come get some.
- You snooze, you lose, Sox.

20:55.418 --> 20:57.734
All right, now pay attention.

20:58.526 --> 21:02.193
It's the M4... spec op standard issue.

21:02.293 --> 21:05.943
Magazine insert. Let it click.

21:07.526 --> 21:10.859
Safety... here.

21:10.984 --> 21:12.901
This is how you shoot it...

21:13.026 --> 21:15.609
in short controlled bursts.

21:16.068 --> 21:18.526
Repeat after me.

21:19.109 --> 21:22.026
I like to kill shit.

21:22.126 --> 21:25.009
I like to kill shit.

21:25.109 --> 21:27.609
That's as long as you need
to hold the trigger for.

21:27.709 --> 21:31.859
And be careful with your ammo.
It's a finite supply.

21:32.984 --> 21:35.484
<i>Level activated.</i>

21:36.193 --> 21:38.443
- Everybody ready?
- Ready.

21:38.543 --> 21:41.734
- Let's go.
- Can you do this?

21:46.734 --> 21:50.484
- I got this, bro.
- Remember to count your ammo.

22:05.609 --> 22:08.193
I like to kill shit, man.

22:10.693 --> 22:13.484
- Check that out, man!
- That was awesome.

22:13.584 --> 22:16.151
I'm gonna get me one of thems.

22:25.026 --> 22:26.818
Shit.

22:30.859 --> 22:33.776
- You okay?
- Yeah.

22:44.193 --> 22:46.401
Can somebody hit pause?

22:51.318 --> 22:53.359
Shit.

22:59.818 --> 23:01.859
Watch out!

23:03.401 --> 23:06.509
Incoming! I'm hit!

23:06.609 --> 23:09.234
You just need to breathe, okay,
Slayer Girl.

23:09.359 --> 23:12.026
I'm not Slayer Girl. Lucy is Slayer Girl.

23:12.126 --> 23:15.218
- I'm Taylor, I came in her place.
- Okay.

23:15.318 --> 23:18.484
- I took her place! I took her place.
- You just need to listen to me, Taylor.

23:18.584 --> 23:21.068
It's only a game. Just remember that.

23:21.193 --> 23:24.526
All these people, they're not real.
They're just pixels and graphics.

23:24.626 --> 23:28.359
- No matter how gory it gets...
- Then fucking shoot someone!

23:29.693 --> 23:31.484
Okay.

23:31.901 --> 23:33.984
I will.

23:50.193 --> 23:52.609
It's harder than you think.

24:16.526 --> 24:19.693
Oh, shit, I got him. I got him!

24:21.484 --> 24:23.943
All right, I surrender. All right?

24:24.043 --> 24:25.484
What?

24:31.026 --> 24:34.610
- Fuck! Turn it off!
- All right.

24:38.693 --> 24:41.776
Help! He's hurt!

24:47.360 --> 24:49.801
It's okay. Look.

24:49.901 --> 24:53.151
- It's okay.
- Oh, fuck!

24:53.251 --> 24:57.526
No, there is something wrong.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.235
Oh, God. Fu...

25:00.360 --> 25:02.235
What?

25:09.693 --> 25:12.110
I don't know what to do.

25:15.276 --> 25:17.276
I got this.

25:52.860 --> 25:55.110
It's not a game.

25:57.151 --> 25:59.485
It's not a game.

26:04.110 --> 26:06.276
You know what I think?

26:06.693 --> 26:10.360
I think it's a reality TV show.
It's gotta be.

26:11.110 --> 26:15.693
- We're all gonna be famous.
- It's not reality TV.

26:16.735 --> 26:20.693
- All right, I thought I was gonna die.
- No one is gonna die.

26:21.985 --> 26:24.193
Come to Daddy.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.360
Real shocks?

26:28.460 --> 26:30.093
Yeah.

26:30.193 --> 26:34.260
Man, how many times do I have
to say it? Real fucking shocks.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.735
- And it came from this.
- It's probably just been calibrated wrong.

26:37.835 --> 26:40.010
So is nobody else worried?

26:40.110 --> 26:43.943
First we got locked doors
and now this, real fucking pain?

26:46.193 --> 26:49.193
We gotta get this shit off us now.

26:54.651 --> 26:56.943
It's not coming off.

26:58.068 --> 27:01.568
Yo, it's a test, man.

27:01.860 --> 27:05.860
If y'all are too pussy to pass it,
I will happily take that money.

27:06.235 --> 27:10.193
It's your military industrial complex.

27:10.318 --> 27:11.610
What are you talking about?

27:11.710 --> 27:16.110
Something like this needs an inside man.

27:18.151 --> 27:22.818
You know, it was very nice of you to
show us how to use the weapons, Shooter.

27:22.918 --> 27:26.235
What was that?
Bit of basic training on top of the 101?

27:26.360 --> 27:30.193
I used to serve. You all know that.

some private sector bullshit, now?

27:35.485 --> 27:37.610

- Don't get involved.

27:37.710 --> 27:41.360
We all got the same
invitation, right? Right?

27:41.460 --> 27:46.468
Is this some kind of a sick experiment?

27:46.568 --> 27:49.301
Remote warfare or massacre
at the touch of a button?

32:24.068 --> 32:25.943
Oh, Jesus Christ.

32:26.043 --> 32:29.193
- Shooter!
- Oh, my God.

32:29.568 --> 32:32.818

Someone got hurt.

33:19.418 --> 33:21.777
No one got hurt.

33:24.735 --> 33:26.985

34:10.152 --> 34:12.360
It fucking kills you.

34:12.485 --> 34:16.860
- It's like some kind of sonic blast, right?
- That's what it is?

34:17.610 --> 34:22.318
He didn't make it to a medipak in time.
Oh, those sick fucks.

34:22.985 --> 34:26.527
- It's like a game over.
- I want someone...

Wait.

35:28.627 --> 35:33.360

- Yeah, look what it did to him.

50:19.377 --> 50:22.944
I'm all cat, no girlfriend.

50:24.611 --> 50:26.344
Bummer.

50:26.444 --> 50:28.819
I live with my grandma.

She has Alzheimer's.

50:36.194 --> 50:38.236
She loves me at mealtimes.

50:44.652 --> 50:48.402
No, I'm... I'm divorced. I...

50:48.527 --> 50:52.527

- Only child. Orphan.

50:57.527 --> 51:01.069

- I think he's an illegal.

51:01.194 --> 51:04.236
All right, wait,
that just leaves Shooter, right?

51:04.361 --> 51:06.427
No, it doesn't.

51:06.527 --> 51:11.027
It just leaves Taylor, and she
wasn't even supposed to be here.

51:15.652 --> 51:19.902
- You think that's important?
- It can't be a coincidence...

51:20.027 --> 51:23.444
that we're all anonymous loners.
The Slayer here is the only odd one out.

51:23.544 --> 51:26.594

awesome friends online.

Seems stupid to be using gamer tags now.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:22.736
Move it or lose it, fat boy.

01:02:45.778 --> 01:02:48.028
<i>Fourth floor.</i>

01:03:00.278 --> 01:03:02.986
- Here.
- Thanks, Edward.

01:03:03.086 --> 01:03:05.111
Take it.

01:03:06.111 --> 01:03:08.486
<i>Detonation in 20 minutes.</i>

01:03:08.586 --> 01:03:10.945
- Ready?
- Let's go.

01:03:25.153 --> 01:03:27.986
Incoming! Get down!

01:03:39.861 --> 01:03:41.695
Carl?

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:45.736
Carl?

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:51.403
- Hey, hey, what's going on? Talk to me.
- I couldn't help her.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:54.111
You couldn't help who?

01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:58.261
Emma. I tried but... I...

01:03:58.361 --> 01:04:02.486
I went back to the fire but...
the smoke... it...

01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:04.986
Is this your girlfriend?

01:04:05.403 --> 01:04:07.945
She died, I couldn't save her.

01:04:08.361 --> 01:04:11.178
It was not your fault.

01:04:11.278 --> 01:04:16.028
But if you don't pull yourself together
we are gonna die in here.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.695
Get up right now.

01:04:22.653 --> 01:04:24.445
Ready?

01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:31.070
I'm out. I'm out.

01:04:31.195 --> 01:04:34.778
- You go. Your turn.
- Move your ass.

01:04:36.486 --> 01:04:40.236
Move! Get in there. Get over there.

01:04:40.653 --> 01:04:43.611
Come on. Get up there!

01:05:26.778 --> 01:05:30.361
<i>15 minutes until detonation.</i>

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:48.653
<i>Level clear. High score, Da Chief.</i>

01:05:58.111 --> 01:06:01.653
Reaper? Oh, God.

01:06:01.986 --> 01:06:03.861
Atlas?

01:06:04.445 --> 01:06:07.736
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:36.903 --> 01:06:39.220
<i>Floor one.</i>

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.528
- Watch out!
- Eat shit.

01:06:46.237 --> 01:06:49.387
Down. I'm out.

01:06:49.487 --> 01:06:52.387
Here. That's my last one.

01:06:52.487 --> 01:06:56.095
- Make every bullet count.
- We're also out of medipaks.

01:06:56.195 --> 01:06:58.737
- I'll look back there.
- I'll go with you.

01:06:58.862 --> 01:07:00.820
No. I've got it.

01:07:01.945 --> 01:07:03.612
Go.

01:07:10.362 --> 01:07:13.653
<i>12 minutes until detonation.</i>

01:07:29.403 --> 01:07:32.612
- I saw it first.
- What the hell are you doing?

01:07:32.737 --> 01:07:35.778
- Give me the medipak.
- No.

01:07:35.878 --> 01:07:38.362
Give me the medipak.

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:40.695
No!

01:07:48.028 --> 01:07:50.445
You remind me of my ex-wife.

01:08:03.445 --> 01:08:05.695
I hit her, like, one time.

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:11.445
And now I can't see my kid.

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:44.487
Taylor?

01:08:44.612 --> 01:08:47.069
I need ammo!

01:08:49.653 --> 01:08:50.970
Yo.

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:53.987
- You're alive.
- Fuck yeah, dude.

01:08:54.112 --> 01:08:56.362
- No Reaper, though.
- I know. I know.

01:08:56.487 --> 01:08:58.319
He fought to the bitter end,
do you know what I mean?

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:00.028
Have you seen Taylor?

01:09:00.127 --> 01:09:03.403
Taylor, Slayer Girl, Taylor.

01:09:03.694 --> 01:09:07.194
- You guys get split up?
- Yeah.

01:09:10.194 --> 01:09:12.444
You hear that?

01:09:26.112 --> 01:09:28.153
Oh, no.

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:34.278
You really think
you can beat me, little man?

01:11:02.153 --> 01:11:04.945
I got a helmet on, you moron.

01:11:05.653 --> 01:11:07.695
I know.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.862
What, you think that's funny?

01:11:12.778 --> 01:11:15.653
If I had more time I'd beat you to death.

01:11:16.862 --> 01:11:21.278
Recruits were warned not to tamper
with their equipment.

01:12:08.695 --> 01:12:11.862
<i>Seven minutes until detonation.</i>

01:12:13.695 --> 01:12:15.945
Let's move out.

01:12:30.445 --> 01:12:32.695
<i>Final level.</i>

01:12:47.778 --> 01:12:49.612
Ready?

01:12:56.737 --> 01:13:00.070
<i>Five minutes to detonation.</i>

01:13:10.195 --> 01:13:12.112
Go.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.987
Fuck.

01:13:52.404 --> 01:13:55.112
<i>Four minutes until detonation.</i>

01:13:59.779 --> 01:14:02.987
- You need to get closer.
- Cover me!

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.779
<i>Detonation in three minutes.</i>

01:15:21.529 --> 01:15:24.737
<i>Two minutes till detonation.</i>

01:15:39.570 --> 01:15:42.387
I need a medipak!

01:15:42.487 --> 01:15:45.112
Quickly! I need a medipak!

01:16:25.237 --> 01:16:27.737
You'd better make it out of here.

01:17:13.904 --> 01:17:17.279
<i>20 seconds till detonation.</i>

01:17:20.445 --> 01:17:23.237
I need a medipak!

01:17:23.654 --> 01:17:27.070
- I need a medipak!
- <i>Detonation in ten...</i>

01:17:27.195 --> 01:17:31.112
- <i>nine... eight... seven... six...
</i>- I need a medipak!

01:17:31.212 --> 01:17:35.137
<i>...five... four... three... two...</i>

01:17:35.237 --> 01:17:36.862
- <i>...one.</i>
- Yes!

01:17:36.987 --> 01:17:39.279
<i>Detonation aborted.</i>

01:17:39.379 --> 01:17:41.820
<i>Detonation aborted.</i>

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.779
<i>Detonation aborted.</i>

01:17:58.862 --> 01:18:02.362
We... we did it.

01:18:09.654 --> 01:18:11.279
We did it.

01:18:13.654 --> 01:18:16.112
We made it, Shelly.

01:18:23.154 --> 01:18:25.362
Recruits...

01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:30.987
today you have earned
your place in history.

01:18:33.029 --> 01:18:37.195
Fortune truly does favor the brave.

01:18:38.154 --> 01:18:43.237
You have made strong and proved
you could stay the course.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:48.695
You have what all men covet...

01:18:49.195 --> 01:18:52.029
but few will ever know.

01:18:52.612 --> 01:18:56.820
A bond found only in each other.

01:18:58.737 --> 01:19:01.487
A brother in arms.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:07.320
I am proud of each and every one of you.

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.779
You have served your country.

01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:15.654
You are men of war.

01:19:21.904 --> 01:19:23.779
You.

01:19:56.987 --> 01:20:01.112
Let's get moving, people.
I want to be out of here by 8:00.

01:21:40.987 --> 01:21:43.262
She's waking up.

01:21:43.362 --> 01:21:47.404
It doesn't matter how much you pay people,
you can't escape their incompetence.

01:21:50.237 --> 01:21:52.571
Get some more.

01:22:04.321 --> 01:22:06.737
I never thought
it'd be me and you who'd...

01:22:06.837 --> 01:22:09.279
make it to the end.

01:22:10.612 --> 01:22:13.112
You won, Shelly.

01:22:13.904 --> 01:22:15.946
People died.

01:22:23.446 --> 01:22:27.821
But the lives we took, we enriched
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.862
They'll find you.

01:22:32.987 --> 01:22:35.487
Who? The police?

01:22:35.612 --> 01:22:38.071
Who'd believe your crazy story?

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:41.529
This never happened.

01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:48.904
So why don't you just kill me now?

01:22:49.004 --> 01:22:51.821
We've shared something.

01:22:53.571 --> 01:22:56.196
We're brothers in arms.

01:22:58.487 --> 01:23:02.279
If I kill you,
it would have all been for nothing.

01:23:10.571 --> 01:23:13.946
Right, we should have been
out of here hours ago.

01:23:50.737 --> 01:23:52.529
Find her!

01:23:54.904 --> 01:23:57.862
Next time there'll be no survivors.

01:24:18.862 --> 01:24:21.279
Is she dead yet?

01:24:54.612 --> 01:24:57.196
You don't want to do this, Shelly.

01:25:06.237 --> 01:25:08.862
The money's yours. Take it.

01:25:09.487 --> 01:25:13.112
This is nothing. Name your price.

01:25:21.029 --> 01:25:23.321
This isn't you.

01:25:34.987 --> 01:25:37.321
That's right.

01:25:37.446 --> 01:25:39.612
We've shared something.

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:45.612
There can't ever be a next time.

01:25:45.712 --> 01:25:47.529
Wait.
