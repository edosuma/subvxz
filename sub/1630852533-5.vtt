00:01.001 --> 00:04.069
<i> [Amy] The stories here go on</i>
<i>  since it was built.</i>

00:04.071 --> 00:07.272
<i>  So much tragedy,</i>
<i>  there's all kinds of rumors</i>
<i>  about the house.</i>

00:08.175 --> 00:09.274
[unintelligible static]

00:09.276 --> 00:12.411
-"Get out."
That is a "Get out."
-"Get out."

00:12.413 --> 00:15.080
I'm finding it very hard
to breathe and there's
something like a...

00:15.082 --> 00:17.783
It feels like there's a weight
on my chest.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.551
<i> [on call] And my heart burns.</i>

00:19.553 --> 00:22.688
"Poison." "It was painful."

00:22.690 --> 00:25.290
"I know that."
"You deserve to die."

00:27.395 --> 00:28.794
<i> [Amy] The dead want a voice.</i>

00:28.796 --> 00:30.462
We just wanna help
this family.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.864
<i> [Adam] The living need</i>
<i>  our help.</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:35.000
-Have you always been here?
-He was watching already.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.516
[Amy] That's quite a house.

00:50.518 --> 00:56.188
That is really insane.
I mean, it's huge, it's old
and supposedly very haunted.

00:57.324 --> 01:01.026
<i> [Amy] The stories here go on</i>
<i>  since it was built, 1890.</i>

01:01.028 --> 01:03.595
<i>  And so the Fee family</i>
<i>  is the most notorious family</i>
<i>  that was here.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:06.031
<i> -[Adam] Yeah.</i>
<i> -[Amy] Their family had</i>
<i>  so much tragedy.</i>

01:06.033 --> 01:09.601
<i>  There was all kinds of rumors</i>
<i> about what befell this family.</i>

01:09.603 --> 01:13.839
<i>  The father supposedly died</i>
<i>  of a heart attack, his wife</i>
<i>  supposedly burned to death</i>

01:13.841 --> 01:17.810
<i>  and then her daughter</i>
<i>  supposedly killed herself</i>
<i>  on the staircase with acid.</i>

01:17.812 --> 01:19.277
<i>  -It's just crazy.</i>
<i> -[Adam] Yeah.</i>

01:19.346 --> 01:20.813
<i>  When Drew purchased</i>
<i>  this house, he didn't know</i>
<i>  it was haunted.</i>

01:20.815 --> 01:22.681
<i>  And then he had a couple</i>
<i>  of experiences.</i>

01:22.683 --> 01:25.984
But really, he still doesn't
understand the activity.

01:25.986 --> 01:28.720
No. He and his husband
live in the back
in the carriage house.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.423
-So, they come in and out
to kind of, renovate.
-[Adam] Yeah.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.760
Now they're wondering,
you know, "Can we live here?"

01:34.762 --> 01:37.763
[Adam] Okay, well, we have
a lot of ground to cover so,
we might as well go in.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.298
[Amy] Yeah, let's go
meet Drew.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.369
-Hey, Drew.
-[Adam] Hey, Drew,
how are you?

01:44.371 --> 01:46.505
Welcome to the Fee house.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.975
-[Amy] Okay,
this is quite a place.
-[Adam] What an entrance.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.911
[Amy] All right now, when you
bought it though,

01:52.913 --> 01:54.813
did you envision there
would be ghosts involved?

01:54.815 --> 01:57.483
I did not. I had no idea
of the history.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.718
I saw the house and I was
like, "I love that one."

01:59.720 --> 02:03.622
And had I known the history,
I probably wouldn't have
bought it.

02:03.624 --> 02:08.160
I learned all the history
about 15 days
after purchasing it.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.063
One of the previous owners
was like,

02:11.065 --> 02:12.931
"Let me see what's going on.
I'll give you all
the history."

02:12.933 --> 02:15.167
So when she filled us in
it was like...
[inhales sharply]

02:16.971 --> 02:18.403
Ooh, a little buyer's remorse.

02:18.405 --> 02:20.272
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.740
-Okay, well, do you wanna kind
of take us in the back here?
-[Adam] Yeah, let's go.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.776
-For sure. Definitely.
-[Amy] You can kind of fill us
in on the history.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.179
[Drew] We're gonna start out
in the library.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.950
So, in this room,
we believe Frank to be here,

02:31.952 --> 02:35.621
the patriarch of the house,
or even just a dark entity.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.991
What makes you think
it is Frank?

02:38.993 --> 02:42.828
-There are lots of things
that happen in this house...
-[Adam] Hmm.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.164
...that make me believe that.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.868
Right here, in this doorway
behind me,

02:49.870 --> 02:53.438
I've heard disembodied
male voice that said,
"I'm right behind you."

02:53.807 --> 02:56.208
-Oh, wow.
-Interesting.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.281
[Drew] So in here,
this is the family parlor...

03:04.618 --> 03:08.387
Room right above is
Katherine's bedroom and it
sounded like someone dropped

03:08.389 --> 03:11.056
a box of books on the floor
above me.

03:11.058 --> 03:16.028
And so, I jumped up
and I ran out to the hallway
and I yell for my husband,

03:16.030 --> 03:18.030
and there was no response.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.699
It was definitely weird.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.066
There's been a couple times

03:22.068 --> 03:23.368
when there's just been
some creepy things like that
that happen

03:23.370 --> 03:25.737
and I'm just like, "I'm out."

03:25.739 --> 03:29.608
-And who is Katherine?
-[Drew] Katherine is one of
the daughters.

03:29.610 --> 03:32.978
So, Frank and Mamie ended up
having five children together

03:32.980 --> 03:34.145
that they raised here
in this house.

03:34.147 --> 03:38.417
<i>  Frank Jr., Edward, Katherine,</i>
<i>  Thomas and Patricia.</i>

03:38.419 --> 03:42.654
If you look behind you there,
that's a picture of Katherine
and her husband Bernan.

03:42.656 --> 03:47.759
[Amy] Why do you think
Katherine would be haunting
this house?

03:47.761 --> 03:52.598
<i> [Drew] Either she loves it</i>
<i>  or because she died</i>
<i>  in this house.</i>

03:52.600 --> 03:54.633
[Amy] Oh, [bleep]. Okay.

03:54.635 --> 03:58.637
So, we'll head upstairs
but on the first landing,
as we pass it,

03:58.639 --> 04:03.976
um, that's where Katherine
drank acid of some sort.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.944
-[Adam] Okay.
-Let's check that out.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.546
[Drew] Yeah, for sure.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.114
-[Adam] That's shocking.
-Katherine.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.451
-[Amy] Okay.
-[Adam] So right here,
she drank acid?

04:12.453 --> 04:13.919
[Drew] Right here,
where we're standing.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.455
-Oh.
-[Drew] And there's reports
that Mamie, their mother,

04:16.457 --> 04:19.591
<i>  -was getting ready for</i>
<i>  one of the son's weddings.</i>
<i> -[Amy] Mm-hmm.</i>

04:19.593 --> 04:22.794
She was upstairs and her
nightgown caught on fire.

04:22.796 --> 04:27.532
The maid put her out
and she didn't say anything
to anyone about being burned.

04:27.534 --> 04:30.836
But their religion didn't
allow them to go see a doctor.

04:30.838 --> 04:34.606
-Oh.
-The brother found out
that Mom got burned,

04:34.608 --> 04:37.409
took her to the hospital,
she died two days later.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.845
But the day that
Katherine died,
they were in this front room

04:39.847 --> 04:44.216
and they were just arguing
over who was to blame
for their mother's death.

04:44.218 --> 04:48.720
And Katherine got, I guess,
overheated, went upstairs,

04:48.722 --> 04:52.758
got acid or cyanide
or something, came back
down here and drank it

04:52.760 --> 04:54.159
in front of her brother.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.395
That is awful.

04:56.397 --> 04:59.431
The newspapers framed it
as an accident

04:59.433 --> 05:03.101
-'cause the family was
wealthy, prominent family.
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

05:03.103 --> 05:07.172
-They didn't want their
skeletons to come out.
-Interesting.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.775
-I'd love to see that
newspaper article.
-[Adam] Yeah.

05:09.843 --> 05:10.976
We'll head upstairs.

05:13.747 --> 05:18.216
This first room here,
this was Mamie's
master bedroom.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.789
-Well, there is activity
in here.
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

05:23.791 --> 05:28.427
We don't know if it's
truly Mamie, if it's another
Fee family member.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.662
[Amy] So this is likely where
she got burned.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.397
-This is not where she
got burned.
-[Amy] Ohh.

05:32.399 --> 05:33.532
The next room over
is where she got burned.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.967
-Okay.
-Yeah, because I didn't see
a fireplace.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.403
-And is the fireplace still
there in the other room?
-[Drew] Yes.

05:38.405 --> 05:40.939
[Adam] Okay. Mamie's master.

05:41.709 --> 05:44.042
[Drew] So, we'll head on down
the hallway.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.912
This is Mamie's dressing room.
As you can see, fireplace.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.747
There is a picture of Mamie.

05:48.749 --> 05:52.617
This is where most of
the activity happens.

05:52.619 --> 05:57.589
You'll notice this door
over here. This door moves.

05:57.591 --> 06:01.827
Also, when we asked Mamie
if she enjoyed living in
this house,

06:01.829 --> 06:03.795
I've heard very faint,
"I like it a lot."

06:03.797 --> 06:05.163
Hmm, okay.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.833
-[Adam] Okay.
-So, there's definitely
attachment to this home.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.701
-[Amy] Ah, okay.
-Oh, wow. Okay.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.269
[Amy] All right,
where to next?

06:11.271 --> 06:16.074
I would say, down the hall.
Katherine's bedroom.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.215
So, my husband is the only
person who's actually
seen something.

06:23.217 --> 06:26.752
Saw something?
Okay, and we're talking
to him, right?

06:26.754 --> 06:30.522
-I don't... He doesn't really
wanna go on camera.
-[Amy and Adam] Oh, okay.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.958
But can you tell us
about his experience?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.460
In that mirror
that's right behind you,
there was a woman's face

06:35.462 --> 06:37.629
and it was completely
blacked out.

06:37.631 --> 06:40.665
We were sitting here talking,
he literally just,
out of the nowhere is like,

06:40.667 --> 06:42.634
"There's a woman
standing behind you."

06:42.636 --> 06:45.470
And so I turned around
to look and she was gone.

06:45.472 --> 06:46.805
-[Adam] Wow.
-Interesting.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.040
-Did he say what she
looked like? Okay.
-[Drew] Yes.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.610
He was sure she looked sad.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.979
-[Amy] Oh, interesting.
-[Adam] Okay.

06:56.817 --> 06:57.783
[Drew] This is all about
the Fees.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.218
There's the handwritten
letters in here.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.788
-[Adam] Oh, wow.
-[Drew] There's postcards
that they sent.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.789
[Amy] Wow.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.957
-[Adam] Okay.
-[Drew] It's a lot of history.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.626
[Adam] Lot of trigger objects
that we can use.

07:07.628 --> 07:12.731
We can verify what it actually
is or who's actually speaking,

07:12.733 --> 07:14.633
I mean, I think
that's probably a big
question that you have.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.601
Yes, I would like
to know exactly

07:16.603 --> 07:18.670
-who we're
communicating with...
-[Adam] Yeah.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.505
-...and should we be
communicating with them?
-[Amy] Yeah.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.608
Is your ultimate goal
to move into this house?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.645
So, the ultimate goal,
we wanted to turn it
into a bed and breakfast.

07:26.647 --> 07:30.582
It will be seven bedrooms,
eight baths when it's done.

07:30.584 --> 07:34.653
Am I right in assuming that
that's kind of why
you've called us here,

07:34.655 --> 07:38.056
-to make sure that
this is safe. Okay.
-[Drew] Correct. Yeah.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.297
<i> [Amy] While it's important for</i>
<i>  us to capture activity here</i>

07:45.299 --> 07:47.365
<i>  and experience it</i>
<i>  for ourselves,</i>

07:47.367 --> 07:51.436
<i>  it's even more important</i>
<i>  that we figure out</i>
<i>  what is behind it and why.</i>

07:51.438 --> 07:54.840
<i>  Because there are</i>
<i>  a lot of deaths associated</i>
<i>  with this property,</i>

07:54.842 --> 07:58.977
<i>  and some of the spirits here</i>
<i>  could be seriously unsettled.</i>

07:58.979 --> 08:03.415
So, right now,
Adam and I are investigating
the staircase area

08:03.417 --> 08:07.285
<i>  just because this is where</i>
<i>  Katherine died of poisoning.</i>

08:07.287 --> 08:08.887
<i>  And it also gives us a really</i>
<i>  good vantage point.</i>

08:08.889 --> 08:12.424
<i>  We can look down the hallway,</i>
<i>  we can look upstairs.</i>

08:12.426 --> 08:14.926
<i>  It just seems like</i>
<i>  a good place to start.</i>

08:14.928 --> 08:19.030
It is very strange how much
tragedy befell the Fee family.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.099
-I mean,
if you think about it...
-It's weird.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.802
...sometimes, you know,
families, they just kind of
seem unlucky,

08:23.804 --> 08:27.906
-[Adam] Mm-hmm.
-...but the Fees really
took that to the next level.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.842
I get a vibe up there.
I just get a vibe,
I don't know.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.979
I'm not psychic.
I'm no Chip Coffey.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.147
Which, Chip, by the way,
texted earlier and said that

08:36.149 --> 08:38.350
he felt like there
was something...

08:40.120 --> 08:41.887
dark lurking here.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.589
-Even though he has no idea
where we are.
-[Adam] Well...

08:44.591 --> 08:46.725
[Amy] If there's anyone
up there or around here,

08:46.727 --> 08:50.795
my friend Adam has a device
that can see you,

08:50.797 --> 08:53.365
even if we can't see you
with our eyes.

08:55.369 --> 08:57.102
But it won't hurt you.

08:59.540 --> 09:04.943
We'd heard a story that
Katherine passed
after drinking

09:04.945 --> 09:08.179
some sort of poison or acid
here on these steps.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.349
And they couldn't save her.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.686
Is that accurate?

09:14.688 --> 09:17.889
Can you make a noise
somewhere in the house,
wherever you are,

09:17.891 --> 09:19.324
just so we know where to go?

09:21.728 --> 09:23.094
[soft knocking]

09:23.897 --> 09:26.231
-Did you hear that
knocking sound?
-I heard that. What was that?

09:27.501 --> 09:29.167
[soft knocking]

09:29.169 --> 09:30.802
-What was that?
-Like a... [clears throat].

09:30.804 --> 09:34.005
[Amy] It's like
a throat clearing or...

09:35.842 --> 09:38.109
I thought it was coming
from like, this section.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.245
[Amy] I'm not sure is...

09:40.881 --> 09:42.713
It might be down here.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.916
<i> [recording plays] Can you make</i>
<i>  a noise somewhere in</i>
<i>  the house, wherever you are,</i>

09:44.918 --> 09:46.985
<i>  just so we know where to go?</i>

09:48.255 --> 09:50.889
[Adam] I'm sorry, wait, what?

09:50.891 --> 09:53.892
<i> [recording plays] Can you make</i>
<i>  a noise somewhere in</i>
<i>  the house, wherever you are,</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:55.593
<i>  just so we know where to go?</i>

09:57.998 --> 10:01.833
-It's weird, there is a sound
that's there. Like a ka-ka-ka.
-[Adam] Like a "ta-ta."

10:01.835 --> 10:03.401
-[Adam] Yeah. Like it's...
-But we heard someone...

10:03.403 --> 10:05.136
[both] ...clearing
their throat.

10:06.373 --> 10:11.743
Are you okay?
Is there something wrong
with you?

10:11.745 --> 10:14.412
What if I sit at the top
of the stairs and you stay
down here?

10:14.414 --> 10:17.649
Yeah, we can do that.

10:17.651 --> 10:22.087
That way we can hear what's
going on upstairs, and
you can listen down here.

10:22.589 --> 10:24.990
[Amy] I'm coming
upstairs, okay?

10:26.660 --> 10:30.762
Amy and I have decided to
split up because we heard
what sounded like a male

10:30.764 --> 10:34.866
clearing his throat, but it
came across very differently
on the recorder.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.335
But something is there,
almost sounded like a voice.

10:37.337 --> 10:42.273
So, Amy's now sitting up
at the top of the stairs
and I'm down here.

10:47.014 --> 10:51.249
Okay, so from up here
I can see downstairs,
I can see the landing,

10:51.251 --> 10:56.321
I can see Mamie's bedroom
and I can see all the way down
this hallway.

10:56.323 --> 11:00.792
If there's someone up here
who would like to talk to us,

11:00.794 --> 11:07.365
here's this little red light.
The closer you speak into that
the louder we can hear you.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.802
So wherever you are
in the house,

11:10.804 --> 11:14.539
can you just make a really
loud noise, like a bang?

11:14.541 --> 11:17.842
Slam a door? Just so we know
where to go.

11:17.844 --> 11:22.380
None of the equipment that
we're using is gonna hurt you.
None of it can hurt you.

11:24.017 --> 11:28.119
It just enables us to see you
easier because...

11:28.121 --> 11:32.090
we have a hard time seeing you
and hearing you with your
own eyes and ears.

11:34.594 --> 11:38.396
[Amy] We've been talking a lot
about the Fee family just
because we know that

11:38.398 --> 11:44.269
the Fees experienced
a lot of tragedy
and we're sorry for that.

11:44.271 --> 11:48.106
But if you're not from
the Fee family, we still would
love to speak with you.

11:49.409 --> 11:54.245
Can you say your name
as loud as you can into this
little red light?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.249
-Gonna listen to
this recorder.
-[Adam] Mm-hmm.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.251
[recording plays]

12:00.887 --> 12:06.558
<i>  ...little red light.</i>
<i> The closer you speak into that</i>

<i>  we have a hard time</i>
<i>  seeing you and hearing you</i>
<i>  with our own eyes and ears.</i>

12:27.614 --> 12:29.547
-What was that? What was that?
-[Amy] Hmm.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.483
That sounds like "get out"
to me.

12:31.485 --> 12:34.619
[recording plays]
<i>  It just enables us to see you</i>
<i>  easier because...</i>

12:34.621 --> 12:38.790
<i> we have a hard time seeing you</i>
<i>  and hearing you with our</i>

12:38.792 --> 12:43.161
-"Get out."
That is a "Get out."
-"Get out."

12:51.738 --> 12:54.105
-That's a female.
-[Amy] Yeah, it does sound
like a female.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.840
Now, keep in mind I am sitting

12:55.842 --> 12:59.611
-right outside the door
of Mamie's room.
-[Adam] Yeah.

12:59.613 --> 13:03.414
[Amy] And I'm in the hallway
and on the staircase where

13:03.416 --> 13:06.918
Katherine would've
come down, I guess,
before she ingested poison.

13:06.920 --> 13:10.321
Right. Whoever said,
"Get out" to us,

13:11.992 --> 13:15.360
you know, I understand where
you're coming from,
we're unfamiliar to you.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.228
We have been asked here.

13:17.230 --> 13:21.699
Before you're so quick to tell
us to get out, can we just
kind of plead our case here?

13:21.701 --> 13:26.838
Whoever you are, we just wanna
make sure that everyone who's
associated with this home,

13:26.840 --> 13:29.240
that their story gets
told accurately.

13:29.242 --> 13:34.546
We've become friends with Drew
and we really want him
to feel safe here.

13:34.548 --> 13:39.150
And he's your best bet
to get this house restored
to what it once was.

13:39.686 --> 13:43.788
So please remember that
Drew is here to help you.

13:43.790 --> 13:48.626
And you need Drew if you don't
want this house to fall
into disrepair.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.996
And if we can't help Drew,
there's a very good chance
he will leave.

13:51.998 --> 13:56.234
And so, I know you told us
to get out
but we will be back.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.240
<i> [Adam] Tragedy shrouded</i>
<i>  the Fee family.</i>

14:02.242 --> 14:05.243
<i>  So much so that a lot of</i>
<i> the story became local legend.</i>

14:05.245 --> 14:08.780
<i>  We're meeting with</i>
<i> Ginger Beck, a local historian</i>
<i>  and photographer,</i>

14:08.782 --> 14:13.017
<i>  who knows the house</i>
<i>  and the story well and can</i>
<i>  help us clear up the facts.</i>

14:14.621 --> 14:16.554
How long were the Fees
there total?

14:16.556 --> 14:20.058
They were there from 1907
to 1940.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.527
-Okay, and they were a very
well known family, correct?
-Very prominent.

14:22.529 --> 14:27.665
What are some of the more
notable deaths that happened
in that house to that family?

14:27.667 --> 14:33.738
Well, you know, we have
documentation of Frank, Mamie,
Katherine, Edward's death.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.673
[Amy] What happened to Mamie?

14:35.675 --> 14:39.577
[Ginger] Um, they had
a open heating grate
in her dressing chamber.

14:39.579 --> 14:45.083
And like, her gown got caught
near the open grate
and she caught fire.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.953
And then, her housekeeper
helped her put it out.
And she had really bad burns.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.655
Now, she was
a Christian Scientist,

14:50.657 --> 14:55.593
which is a form of religion
where they not necessarily
go to the hospital.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.264
She didn't tell anybody about
the burns for
a couple of weeks,

14:59.266 --> 15:01.833
and by then, there was such
a bad infection,

15:01.835 --> 15:05.403
um, that they forced her to go
to the hospital
and she later died.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.405
-[Amy] It was too late. Okay.
-Mm-hmm. It was too late.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.541
So when that happened,
that was really the catalyst
for the argument between

15:10.543 --> 15:11.809
Edward and Katherine, right?

15:11.811 --> 15:16.714
There's "official"
stories versus
the granddaughter's story

15:16.716 --> 15:19.250
of what her mother told her
really happened.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.554
According to the daughter,
who was eight at the time,

15:23.556 --> 15:27.425
two brothers, Edward
and Frank Jr., they were
playing cards in the parlor

15:27.427 --> 15:30.461
and Katherine, her husband
and her daughter were there.

15:30.463 --> 15:35.400
And the argument erupted
about whose fault it was
that Mamie died.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.970
Katherine was telling them
they had lost the faith.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.573
And she came downstairs
and drank the poison
on the stairs.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.808
-[Amy] Ah, okay.
-[Adam] Okay, okay.

15:43.810 --> 15:47.412
And the official story is,
it was an accident
with the poison.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.479
-[Ginger] With
the poison, yes.
-Right.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.482
[Amy] So no one really knows
which story is true.

15:51.484 --> 15:55.586
Right, it's interesting to me
because if she was such
a woman of faith

15:55.588 --> 15:58.957
and that was
her argument, right?
"You didn't have faith."

15:58.959 --> 16:03.061
Like, why would she commit
the act of suicide

16:03.063 --> 16:05.563
-if she... You get what
I'm saying?
-[Ginger] Right.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.800
It sort of doesn't make sense
unless she did it
to prove a point.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.836
But it doesn't make sense
if someone is
that religious and

16:11.838 --> 16:14.973
believing that they would do
that kind of thing?

16:14.975 --> 16:16.341
-[Amy] Right.
-That's so strange.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.979
[Amy] Have you had any
experiences in the house?

16:20.981 --> 16:24.582
The day that I went to take
the photos of the house,
we just walked through.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.584
I snapped my photos.

16:26.586 --> 16:31.089
I got home and I uploaded
the photos to my computer,
and I was like,

16:31.091 --> 16:32.523
[chuckling]
"These are all blurry."

16:32.525 --> 16:34.859
So, I told Drew, because we'd
been sort of texting, I said,

16:34.861 --> 16:37.762
"All of my photos are blurry.
I'm gonna have to retake 'em,"

16:37.764 --> 16:40.398
And I've never had that
happen before.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.036
So, we went back.
I was like, "Okay, um,
can I take your picture?"

16:45.038 --> 16:48.106
-[Amy and Adam] Yeah.
-And sort of asked
permission of the house and...

16:48.341 --> 16:50.575
all of them came out clear.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.678
-Yeah, that's so...
Yeah, okay.
-We didn't ask permission.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.314
Well, if we have any
other questions,
obviously we'll reach out,

16:56.316 --> 16:57.982
but you've been a big help.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.652
<i> It's hard to believe Katherine</i>
<i>  took her own life.</i>

17:01.654 --> 17:04.489
<i>  However, her daughter,</i>
<i> Patricia, apparently witnessed</i>
<i>  the event</i>

17:04.491 --> 17:05.956
<i> and claims it was intentional.</i>

17:05.958 --> 17:08.593
<i>  We already knew there were</i>
<i>  two different versions</i>
<i>  of the story,</i>

17:08.595 --> 17:11.896
<i>  but we weren't aware</i>
<i>  of how much it divided</i>
<i>  the Fee family.</i>

17:11.898 --> 17:16.768
<i>  Determining whether Katherine</i>
<i>  took her own life</i>
<i>  is a hard question to ask,</i>

17:16.770 --> 17:19.604
<i>  but the truth might help</i>
<i>  settle the activity that</i>
<i>  worries Drew.</i>

17:19.606 --> 17:21.372
<i>  We're calling in Chip,</i>
<i>  because to be honest,</i>

17:21.374 --> 17:24.976
<i>  we're not even sure</i>
<i>  who exactly we're talking to</i>
<i>  at this point.</i>

17:24.978 --> 17:27.912
<i>  He may be able to pick up</i>
<i>  on whether we're headed</i>
<i>  in the right direction</i>

17:27.914 --> 17:29.347
<i>  or totally off base.</i>

17:32.852 --> 17:34.252
Wow, um...

17:34.821 --> 17:38.890
<i>  -Amy, will you go up</i>
<i>  the steps?</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

17:38.892 --> 17:42.927
And Adam, will you go to
the landing so I can see her?

17:42.929 --> 17:45.063
-Yeah.
-Well, that's wicked.

17:45.865 --> 17:49.600
<i>  Woman, that's where she is.</i>

17:49.602 --> 17:51.569
That's where she is,
right where you are.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.605
And my heart hurts
when you're there.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.742
I'm finding it very hard
to breathe and there's
something like a...

17:57.744 --> 17:59.877
It feels like there's
a weight on my chest.

17:59.879 --> 18:02.313
<i> -[Amy] Okay.</i>
<i> -[Chip] Now let's</i>
<i>  go on up, Adam.</i>

18:14.360 --> 18:16.727
There's a lot of people
involved in this.

18:16.729 --> 18:20.965
There's a family that's
involved in this
and it's a sizable family.

18:20.967 --> 18:24.969
Okay. All right, you wanna
move to the next room?

18:34.047 --> 18:36.180
I feel a woman in this room.

18:37.684 --> 18:41.419
<i>  She's like the matriarch</i>
<i> and she's kind of domineering.</i>

18:42.789 --> 18:46.891
-Okay.
<i> -[Chip] She's very stoic.</i>

18:46.893 --> 18:51.429
But she and her husband
have a number of kids.
There's a number of children.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.333
Why am I drawn to this?

18:57.203 --> 18:59.303
-This fireplace?
-[Amy] The fireplace?

18:59.672 --> 19:01.072
<i> [Chip] Yeah.</i>

19:03.276 --> 19:06.944
Whatever this space is,
I'm feeling a real...

19:13.019 --> 19:18.189
<i>  There just seems to be</i>
<i>  something very familiar about</i>
<i>  this location to me.</i>

19:19.092 --> 19:21.325
All right, so, it just hit me.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.829
[Adam] Yeah?

19:24.831 --> 19:29.567
-Remember the case in Newport?
-[Amy] Yeah, Valley Inn.

19:29.569 --> 19:32.003
<i> -[Chip] With the fireplace?</i>
<i> -[Amy] Mm-hmm.</i>

19:33.072 --> 19:36.040
<i> [Chip] Wow, it's a woman.</i>
<i>  I heard a [bleep].</i>

19:36.042 --> 19:37.908
It's hot!

19:37.910 --> 19:41.979
<i>  The story goes, the lady</i>
<i>  at this house, she fell into</i>
<i>  the fireplace and was burned.</i>

19:41.981 --> 19:45.983
-That's the feeling
I get here.
-[Adam] Okay.

19:51.925 --> 19:55.960
Okay. [high-pitched]
Stop. Stop.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.396
<i>  -Adam?</i>
<i> -Yep.</i>

19:58.932 --> 20:02.166
<i> [Chip] Go up to the mantle.</i>

20:05.772 --> 20:07.905
All right, stop.
This woman lived in the house,

20:07.907 --> 20:09.373
the woman in
the picture, right?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.409
<i> [Amy and Adam] Yes.</i>

20:11.411 --> 20:14.579
[Drew] That's a picture
of Katherine
and her husband, Bernan.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.380
She's the one at the top
of the stairs.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.124
She's the one at the top
of the stairs.

20:27.126 --> 20:32.296
On the first landing,
that's where Katherine
drank acid of some sort.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.799
She's the one that's at
the top of the stairs?

20:34.801 --> 20:38.603
One hundred percent.
She's the one that's
at the top of the stairs.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.372
Are you getting any, like,
vibe from her or...

20:49.682 --> 20:52.683
Anger. [hesitates]
Anger. Angry.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.786
There's something angry.
Angry.

20:55.788 --> 20:59.323
-[Adam] Anger, okay.
-And very territorial
and very, like...

21:01.194 --> 21:04.595
like, we've seen this entity
in other places
that becomes very

21:04.597 --> 21:08.899
territorial of a space
and like, [yelling angrily]
"This is my space!"

21:08.901 --> 21:12.169
-[Adam] Okay.
-[Amy] If you pick up anything
else, please let us know.

21:12.171 --> 21:13.237
All right, kids.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.174
<i> -[Adam] We'll talk soon.</i>
<i> -[Amy] Bye.</i>

21:17.176 --> 21:20.378
It's interesting. I mean,
it definitely like, tells us
we're on the right track.

21:20.380 --> 21:24.081
But like, once again, the Fees
were the most prominent family
that was here.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.618
-Yeah, and we know we got
the EVP that says, "Get out."
-"Get out."

21:27.620 --> 21:29.720
It as female,
you were sitting at
the top of the stairs.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.857
I was just gonna say,
think about where I was
when we got that.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.259
-[Adam] Yeah.
-Right where he said that
Katherine was.

21:35.561 --> 21:37.395
Yeah, so, I mean,

21:37.397 --> 21:40.831
maybe we are on
the right track, we just have
to approach it maybe...

21:40.833 --> 21:43.934
-Maybe asking permission?
-I think that'll be big.

21:43.936 --> 21:47.571
<i>  So, right now,</i>
<i>  Adam and I are getting ready</i>
<i>  to investigate.</i>

21:47.573 --> 21:50.174
So, we're going to
introduce ourselves,

21:50.176 --> 21:53.144
ask permission of the spirits
here to investigate,

21:53.146 --> 21:57.214
<i>  then start on the landing</i>
<i>  of the Fee house and try to</i>
<i>  reach out to her</i>

21:57.216 --> 21:59.383
<i>  and figure out</i>
<i>  what actually happened here.</i>

21:59.852 --> 22:03.387
So, to the...

22:03.389 --> 22:05.723
the people who are here
with us who are non-living,

22:05.725 --> 22:07.692
may we please talk to you?

22:07.694 --> 22:11.062
We respectfully ask your
permission to be in this house

22:11.064 --> 22:14.432
and to find out more about
you and your families.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.201
If that is all right with you.

22:19.672 --> 22:23.407
Last night, when we were here
we got a voice that said,
"Get out," very clearly.

22:23.409 --> 22:26.644
But this is also the spot
where Chip said
the woman stands.

22:26.646 --> 22:30.014
So, we're going right into it.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.515
We've brought out
the Frank's Box.

22:31.517 --> 22:35.119
We're really hoping to get
some answers to guide us
on where to go next.

22:38.424 --> 22:40.958
[Adam] So, you can use this
device to speak--

22:40.960 --> 22:44.995
-[Amy] "Be careful."
-[unintelligible static]

22:46.232 --> 22:47.865
[Adam] What should I be
careful for?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.267
Did something happen here that
we need to know about?

22:51.003 --> 22:54.071
-"This is home."
-[Adam] Okay.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.806
-Is Mamie here?
-[Amy] "Not them."

22:55.808 --> 22:58.676
-[Adam] Katherine,
are you up here?
-"Right."

22:58.678 --> 23:02.012
Katherine, can you please
tell us who else is here
with you?

23:03.816 --> 23:06.851
-[Adam] Please tell us
who else is here.
-"Why are you doing this?"

23:06.853 --> 23:08.252
We're trying to help you.

23:11.624 --> 23:15.259
-Don't you want your help?
Katherine--
-"We're doomed."

23:15.962 --> 23:18.062
-Katherine, listen.
-[Amy] "Poison."

23:19.165 --> 23:20.197
"It was painful."

23:25.905 --> 23:28.906
Okay, Katherine,
please talk to us.

23:28.908 --> 23:32.443
The poison,
the painfulness of it,
did you mean to do that?

23:33.780 --> 23:36.147
Did you mean to drink
that poison?

23:36.449 --> 23:38.983
"You heard me."

23:38.985 --> 23:43.287
-So you drank the poison
on purpose?
-"Right, they did it."

23:44.524 --> 23:46.056
[Adam] What did they do?

23:48.261 --> 23:51.328
-What did they do?
Did they change the--
-"Actually."

23:51.731 --> 23:52.430
"Careful."

23:53.900 --> 23:55.166
-"Listen"
-[Adam] Yes.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.001
"Acid."

23:57.603 --> 24:00.037
I get it, okay. Acid.

24:00.039 --> 24:05.009
Did they change the story
to fit the family needs?

24:05.011 --> 24:07.077
They said it was an accident.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.614
-Is that true?
-"Family."

24:10.616 --> 24:14.051
"There's things that
we can't say, we whisper."

24:15.121 --> 24:17.188
That makes a whole hell
of a lot of sense.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.123
Um, okay.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.826
How can we help you?
How can we help you?

24:21.828 --> 24:25.729
Just answer me this before
I stop her. I need to know
how we can help you.

24:25.731 --> 24:30.100
-Please tell us.
I know we just started.
-[Amy] "Must go."

24:30.102 --> 24:32.770
[Adam] Where's Katherine now?
Where's Katherine right now?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.772
[Amy] "Why don't you look?"

24:34.774 --> 24:37.408
I'm looking. Is she in
this room behind me?

24:37.410 --> 24:39.276
Is she upstairs or downstairs?

24:40.446 --> 24:43.180
"The first one. This one."

24:44.817 --> 24:50.020
Okay. Well, I'm gonna
stop her because it's getting
too intense.

24:52.859 --> 24:56.861
[bleep] That was so hard
to listen to.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.230
-It's really stressful.
-[Adam] That's...

25:01.734 --> 25:03.834
-This is really intense,
this spirit box.
-It's...

25:03.836 --> 25:07.104
really hard to listen to.
It's like...

25:07.106 --> 25:09.406
they're just like,
spitting out words.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.308
It's so weird, but...

25:12.011 --> 25:14.144
-Katherine...
-Uh-huh?

25:14.647 --> 25:16.447
-...did it on purpose.
-[Amy] Okay.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.583
You kept saying,
"Acid, it was painful."

25:19.585 --> 25:26.724
And as if it was other people
that's keeping that
so tight under wraps,

25:26.726 --> 25:30.761
that there's little bits of
when we get the truth

25:30.763 --> 25:35.900
and then it's sort of like,
"We cannot talk about that."

25:35.902 --> 25:38.769
-"There's secrets that
we whisper." She did it...
-Mm-hmm.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.872
...and she's here.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.409
They're a very
well-to-do family,
very high society.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.577
I could see why they would try
to cover it up.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.381
Well, it's interesting because
you and I were like, "I think
it was an accident."

25:50.383 --> 25:52.583
-Because...
-All the papers.

25:52.585 --> 25:57.021
All the papers say this
but also like, no other adult
has corroborated the story.

25:57.023 --> 25:58.355
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.
-So they were so tight-lipped.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.658
Yeah, took it to their graves.

26:00.660 --> 26:04.428
<i> [Adam] We just conducted</i>
<i>  a ground-breaking spirit box</i>
<i>  session with Katherine,</i>

26:04.430 --> 26:06.630
<i>  who's clearly willing</i>
<i>  to communicate with us.</i>

26:06.632 --> 26:09.400
<i>  So, now we're gonna ask</i>
<i>  her some follow-up questions.</i>

26:12.505 --> 26:17.608
[Amy] So, um, we just had
a conversation with someone

26:17.610 --> 26:21.412
who was telling us that
there's a lot of secrets
in this house.

26:21.414 --> 26:26.917
We thought we were talking
to Katherine, maybe.
Katherine, are you here?

26:26.919 --> 26:30.254
Katherine, if somebody is
trying to silence you,
if it's your family,

26:31.023 --> 26:33.090
you don't have
to hide anymore.

26:33.859 --> 26:37.661
We're about trying to
uncover the truth.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.396
[Amy] Your daughter, Patricia,
is the only one...

26:39.932 --> 26:41.966
who said what really happened.

26:45.805 --> 26:49.440
Did you drink acid on purpose?

26:51.644 --> 26:54.244
Do you regret your actions
that day?

26:57.350 --> 26:59.316
If you could change it,
would you?

27:03.789 --> 27:07.291
If you could say anything
to your daughter now,
what would you say?

27:10.429 --> 27:14.031
Were you reunited with
your mother, Mamie?

27:14.800 --> 27:17.167
Is there anything else
you want to tell us?

27:17.269 --> 27:19.103
All right, thank you.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.973
<i> [recording plays] We thought</i>
<i>  we were talking</i>
<i>  to Katherine, maybe.</i>

27:22.975 --> 27:24.408
<i>  -Katherine, are you here?</i>
<i> -[Adam] What's that sound?</i>

27:24.410 --> 27:25.409
What is that?

27:29.048 --> 27:30.614
[Adam] It was up here.
Like, on that side.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.716
Really? That was really loud.

27:32.718 --> 27:36.553
-[Adam] I don't know what it
was though. It sounded like...
-Scraping or...

27:36.555 --> 27:38.422
I thought I heard, like,
furniture moving.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.958
<i> [recording plays] We thought</i>
<i>  we were talking</i>
<i>  to Katherine, maybe.</i>

27:40.960 --> 27:41.692
<i>  -Katherine, are you here?</i>
<i> -[Adam] What's that sound?</i>

27:41.694 --> 27:43.426
What is that?

27:44.764 --> 27:48.065
Well, let's keep listening.
It's while we're listening
to this, it's almost like...

27:48.067 --> 27:50.434
[softly] she's trying
to tell a secret.
Let's see what she said.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.002
[bleep]

27:53.072 --> 27:55.406
[recording plays]
<i>  Your daughter, Patricia,</i>
<i>  is the only one</i>

27:55.408 --> 27:57.408
<i> who said what really happened.</i>

27:57.410 --> 27:58.876
-[recording continues]
<i>  If you...</i>
<i> -Wait.</i>

27:58.878 --> 28:01.145
-Wait.
-[recording plays]
<i>  Your daughter, Patricia,</i>

28:01.147 --> 28:03.347
<i>  is the only one who said</i>
<i>  what really happened.</i>

28:04.116 --> 28:05.249
-[Adam] "Thank you."
-"Thank you."

28:05.251 --> 28:07.818
Maybe she didn't know that.

28:07.820 --> 28:11.121
<i> [recording continues] If you</i>
<i>  could say anything to your</i>
<i>  daughter, what would you say?</i>

28:12.391 --> 28:14.358
Oh, that's when you bring up
her daughter.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.193
Every time.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.164
<i> [recording plays] If you</i>
<i>  could say anything to your</i>
<i>  daughter, what would you say?</i>

28:21.067 --> 28:22.065
[Amy] Sorry.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.168
-It's really quiet.
-[whispers] "Sorry."

28:24.170 --> 28:27.371
<i> [recording plays] Were you</i>
<i>  reunited with</i>
<i>  your mother, Mamie?</i>

28:28.240 --> 28:29.807
Said "no."

28:29.809 --> 28:31.375
[recorder playing]
<i>  ...you want to tell us?</i>
<i>  All right, thank you.</i>

28:31.377 --> 28:33.911
-[turns off recorder]
-The main thing was
her daughter.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.747
-"Thank you." It was a really
clear, but soft EVP.
-[Adam] Yeah.

28:36.749 --> 28:39.850
And very different from
the EVP we got last night,
in almost the same voice.

28:39.852 --> 28:42.386
Exactly, it as if she...

28:42.388 --> 28:45.756
We asked for permission,
she gave permission and...

28:45.758 --> 28:48.692
Now she's talking.
That's so bizarre
to me, though.

28:48.694 --> 28:51.028
It's to weird because
you have to think, like,

28:51.030 --> 28:54.732
they must've lived with
that secret for so long.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.633
And it was in all the papers.

28:56.635 --> 29:00.003
They had to keep up that ruse
that she just made

29:00.005 --> 29:03.073
a simple mistake
and accidentally drank acid.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.676
And they never told the truth.

29:05.678 --> 29:07.644
What was moving
in the middle of it?
Sounded like furniture

29:07.646 --> 29:09.413
-from the other room.
-[Amy] Yeah, it was far.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.415
-Like, that time.
-[Amy] I'm sorry it was
really loud.

29:11.417 --> 29:12.649
-Shall we move to where
that sound was?
-[Adam] Yeah.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.885
-Okay.
-I wanna move to that
dressing room.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.221
-Because that's where
Mamie caught fire.
-[Amy] Yeah.

29:28.934 --> 29:30.300
[Adam] Mamie...

29:31.737 --> 29:33.270
we wanna talk to you.

29:34.807 --> 29:37.875
We've heard stories about
how you died.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.676
You got a really severe burn.

29:39.678 --> 29:42.913
How did you stand that?

29:42.915 --> 29:45.582
Your family was left pretty
broken after that.

29:45.584 --> 29:49.086
Not blaming you
but just know that they
mourned your loss greatly

29:49.088 --> 29:51.722
and I don't think Katherine
ever recovered.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.023
Do you realize that?

29:54.827 --> 29:59.096
We're not trying to
open old wounds
but we're trying to...

29:59.932 --> 30:02.032
figure out why are you
still here.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.170
Your death was an accident.

30:07.873 --> 30:12.276
What we're hearing is,
your daughter's death
was intentional.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.045
Do you know if that's true?

30:16.549 --> 30:19.049
[Amy] I'm gonna stop this now.

30:19.051 --> 30:22.386
[recording plays]
<i>  We've heard stories about</i>
<i>  how you died.</i>

30:23.422 --> 30:26.390
<i> We heard about how you burned.</i>

30:26.392 --> 30:28.592
<i>  How did you stand that?</i>

30:28.594 --> 30:31.528
<i>  Your family was left pretty</i>
<i>  broken after that.</i>

30:31.530 --> 30:34.998
<i>  Not blaming you</i>
<i>  but just know that they</i>
<i>  mourned your loss greatly</i>

30:35.000 --> 30:37.067
<i>  and I don't think Katherine</i>
<i>  ever recovered.</i>

30:37.069 --> 30:38.335
<i>  Do you realize that?</i>

30:39.905 --> 30:41.438
-[Amy] Hmm.
-That.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.140
[recording plays]
<i>  Do you realize that?</i>

30:53.919 --> 30:55.352
[recording plays]
<i>  Not blaming you</i>
<i>  but just know that</i>

30:55.354 --> 30:56.920
<i> they mourned your loss greatly</i>

30:56.922 --> 31:00.424
<i>  and I don't think Katherine</i>
<i>  ever recovered.</i>
<i>  Do you realize that?</i>

31:02.027 --> 31:03.560
-[Adam] "I did not."
-[recording continues]

31:03.562 --> 31:07.197
<i> ...and I don't think Katherine</i>
<i>  ever recovered.</i>
<i>  Do you realize that?</i>

31:07.933 --> 31:10.701
Two intelligent spirits
not speaking to each other.

31:10.703 --> 31:12.169
-[Amy] But in the same house.
-Yeah.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.504
They're co-existing
but they aren't.

31:14.506 --> 31:18.041
It makes sense if she didn't
because in the other room
who we thought was Katherine,

31:18.043 --> 31:20.444
was like, "Are you with
your mother?"
And it was like, "No."

31:20.446 --> 31:22.613
[Amy] That's so strange.
Like, they're in
the same house, though.

31:22.615 --> 31:24.848
-Right, but they don't...
-[Amy] What does that mean?

31:24.850 --> 31:29.186
[Adam] Maybe they don't know
that each other
is in the space.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.856
And is that a product of like,
the afterlife?

31:32.858 --> 31:36.426
Or is it literally
the family's still keeping
the secrets from each other?

31:36.428 --> 31:39.796
That's so crazy
to think about.

31:39.798 --> 31:46.837
I wonder if there's a way
that you and I could set up
a moment in some way,

31:46.839 --> 31:50.274
to try to connect
the daughter and the mother.

31:50.276 --> 31:54.745
[Amy] I think we're gonna have
to think of a way outside
the box to figure that out.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.346
Copy.

31:58.517 --> 32:03.086
When we investigated tonight,
it became very clear that
it wasn't an accident.

32:03.088 --> 32:06.790
We're also very shocked that
Katherine and Mamie
are in the same house,

32:06.792 --> 32:10.594
<i> in spirit form, and they don't</i>
<i>  communicate with each other,</i>
<i>  or talk to each other.</i>

32:10.596 --> 32:11.928
<i>  And we've never seen</i>
<i>  that before,</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:14.564
<i>  and we have to figure out</i>
<i>  how to bring them together</i>

32:14.566 --> 32:17.034
<i>  because I think that closure</i>
<i>  on the other side</i>

32:17.036 --> 32:18.969
<i>  is definitely gonna help</i>
<i>  this case.</i>

32:22.107 --> 32:23.307
[clicks tongue]

32:24.043 --> 32:25.442
Okay, look at this.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.045
-[Amy] What?
-[Adam] So...

32:30.115 --> 32:34.084
This is pretty early
in the morning.
I'm gonna show you this.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.354
At 5:10, look at that.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.056
-[Amy] Whoa.
-[Adam] Right?

32:39.658 --> 32:41.658
Just comes, like,
it's like it's coming
from that hallway,

32:41.660 --> 32:44.594
doesn't go past the doorframe.

32:44.596 --> 32:48.732
-That looks like someone
walking by the door.
-Right, but here's the thing.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.702
This is Mamie's room.
I think it comes from

32:51.704 --> 32:54.905
the daughter's hallway,
room-bedroom area,

32:54.907 --> 32:57.474
does not go further than
Mamie's room and goes back.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.743
-Isn't that--
-That's weird.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.946
That's not what you wanna see
when you're trying to sleep
in an old house.

33:02.948 --> 33:06.683
-Outside your door.
-No! No! And...

33:06.685 --> 33:09.386
it never showed up.
It didn't do it again.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.588
So, it wasn't a glitch,
it wasn't like...

33:11.590 --> 33:14.791
car lights, it does not
happen again.

33:14.793 --> 33:18.729
But it's definitely...
So, it's definitely in
the hallway here.

33:18.731 --> 33:21.665
Is it that kind of like,
Katherine's coming and like,

33:21.667 --> 33:24.501
thinking about talking
to her mom but then
changes her mind

33:24.503 --> 33:27.537
-and goes back to her room
like that moment?
-I mean...

33:27.539 --> 33:29.906
it's weird that you say that
but it's almost as if like,

33:29.908 --> 33:32.309
whatever this is,
got to a certain point,

33:32.311 --> 33:35.379
and could not continue,
or didn't continue.

33:35.381 --> 33:40.484
<i> [Amy] We need to figure out</i>
<i>  a way to get Katherine</i>
<i>  and Mamie to communicate.</i>

33:40.486 --> 33:43.553
<i>  Because they seem to be on,</i>
<i>  like, a different plane.</i>

33:43.555 --> 33:45.956
[Adam] What if we both
did the spirit box,

33:45.958 --> 33:48.658
blindfolded ourselves,
listen to the noise
cancelling headphones.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.729
And you sat in one doorway
and I sit in the other doorway

33:52.731 --> 33:55.432
and then maybe, since
you've already had, sort of,

33:55.434 --> 33:58.535
-translated Katherine...
-Right.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.637
Maybe you should talk
to Katherine
and I'm representing Mamie.

34:00.639 --> 34:04.074
And then, maybe,
there can be a conversation.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.444
-We could try it. I mean, it
would be really interesting.
-I mean...

34:07.446 --> 34:09.312
<i> [Adam] This is crazy.</i>

34:09.314 --> 34:12.382
<i>  We're attempting to reunite</i>
<i>  a mother and a daughter</i>
<i>  in spirit form.</i>

34:12.384 --> 34:16.386
<i>  Even crazier,</i>
<i>  we'll each be listening</i>
<i>  to a different spirit box.</i>

34:16.388 --> 34:18.722
<i>  We won't have any idea what</i>
<i>  the other person is saying,</i>

34:18.724 --> 34:21.091
<i>  until we watch</i>
<i>  the footage afterwards.</i>

34:24.630 --> 34:28.598
Mamie and Katherine,
I know you saw this yesterday.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.635
Amy was sitting over there
and you were talking to her.

34:31.637 --> 34:35.105
But, Mamie, you may not
have seen this.

34:35.107 --> 34:37.774
So, all you have to do is
speak through this device.

34:37.776 --> 34:41.044
And we'll be able to hear you
and we're going to
relay your messages.

34:41.046 --> 34:42.379
-Are you ready?
-[Amy] I'm ready.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.214
[Adam] Okay.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.091
Speak out.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.064
"I'm surprised."

35:02.868 --> 35:04.401
"Of all the people."

35:05.771 --> 35:07.237
"Do you remember...

35:09.775 --> 35:11.241
-purple flowers?"
-"Yes."

35:12.144 --> 35:14.144
"We had to be a certain way."

35:17.716 --> 35:18.415
"Mom?"

35:21.120 --> 35:23.286
"You are in heaven."

35:29.928 --> 35:31.094
"I know that."

35:34.666 --> 35:36.166
"I can't condone."

35:36.168 --> 35:38.235
There was a sigh, a breath.

35:39.404 --> 35:42.239
-"You deserve to die."
-"It's true."

35:45.144 --> 35:46.343
[Adam] "Tell her now."

35:47.779 --> 35:49.012
"Why."

35:52.951 --> 35:54.351
"I just had to do it."

35:57.055 --> 35:58.321
I heard her crying.

36:03.962 --> 36:06.129
"Never again, please."

36:06.832 --> 36:08.064
"You're killing me."

36:09.735 --> 36:10.367
"Stop."

36:16.175 --> 36:18.208
"I'll always care."

36:19.044 --> 36:20.310
Getting chills.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.050
[sighs] Okay.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.053
Did it make any sense?

36:32.491 --> 36:36.660
-I definitely heard weird
[bleep] going on in here.
-[Adam] Yeah.

36:36.662 --> 36:40.697
What's weird is, you know how
when you do this, you sort of
get a feeling of who...

36:40.699 --> 36:42.299
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.
-...you feel like you're
talking to?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.768
Like, I felt who I was
talking to was Mamie.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.404
-I don't know why. Okay.
-I thought I was talking
to Katherine.

36:47.406 --> 36:50.507
-I definitely thought I was
talking to Katherine.
-Okay. And I remember,

36:50.509 --> 36:53.643
-a female voice said,
"I don't condone."
-[Amy] Hmm.

36:53.645 --> 36:57.714
And I got the feeling
that it was because of
what she did.

36:57.716 --> 37:01.685
Right. Yeah, she was like,
"I had to."

37:01.687 --> 37:05.255
Like, I heard these weird...
I was like,
"Okay." Like...

37:05.257 --> 37:07.657
And then, I heard her say,
"Mom," at one point.

37:07.659 --> 37:10.560
Like at the end of a sentence.
It was very strange.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.062
-[Adam] Yeah. Yeah.
-I think we should watch
the tape.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.630
-Let's do it.
-Let's go downstairs
and watch it

37:13.632 --> 37:15.966
and see if we can decipher it.

37:17.703 --> 37:21.171
<i> -[Adam] "You deserve to die."</i>
<i> -[Amy] "Of all people."</i>

37:21.173 --> 37:24.975
-[Amy chuckles] Like,
wow, that's so interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.810
-[Adam] That's cool.
-That's so powerful.

37:26.812 --> 37:27.677
<i> [Adam] "I'll always care."</i>

37:27.679 --> 37:31.681
-[Amy and Adam laugh]
-That's crazy.

37:31.683 --> 37:35.518
It's incredible. It's just
really strange, the dynamic.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.555
Like, you can tell there's
love there,

37:38.557 --> 37:42.125
but you can tell they're
having a serious conversation
about what happened.

37:42.127 --> 37:45.395
-Right.
-You can tell Mamie's like,
"Why did you do that?"

37:45.397 --> 37:48.798
Yeah. It was as if
the mother was like,
"I had an accident..."

37:48.800 --> 37:50.767
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.
-[Adam] "...and I died
from it."

37:50.769 --> 37:51.835
[Amy] Mm-hmm.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.271
[Adam] "You took
a coward's route."

37:54.273 --> 37:55.772
Yeah, she's mad at her
for killing herself.

37:55.774 --> 38:00.577
[Adam] Right, almost like,
"What you did
is hard for me to forgive."

38:00.579 --> 38:04.714
It's like, "You've put...
You put yourself
here in this place.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.817
-In this position."
-So bizarre.
What a strange conversation.

38:07.819 --> 38:09.286
I'm glad we could bring them
together but--

38:09.288 --> 38:11.521
They now know
each other's here at least.

38:11.523 --> 38:15.392
I don't know if that means
they'll be able to talk
to each other regularly.

38:15.394 --> 38:19.296
I don't know.
Maybe that's something
we tell Drew to work on.

38:24.469 --> 38:27.671
All right, so, the house is
definitely haunted.

38:27.673 --> 38:32.676
But what's interesting is that
we encountered something here
that we've never seen before.

38:32.678 --> 38:38.581
Katherine and Mamie, like,
they both had very
traumatic deaths here,

38:38.583 --> 38:40.684
but the weird thing was,
they were not aware
of each other.

38:40.686 --> 38:44.454
So we were brainstorming,
trying to figure out, "How can
we get Katherine and Mamie

38:44.456 --> 38:46.589
to acknowledge that
they are both here?"

38:46.591 --> 38:50.894
So what we did was, we both
listened to spirit boxes

38:50.896 --> 38:54.964
and the result was two people
having a conversation that

38:54.966 --> 38:57.600
-probably haven't talked
to each other in, you know...
-[Drew] Wow.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.936
-...a hundred years.
-[Drew] That's awesome.

38:59.938 --> 39:03.006
-Like an argument that
they just never had.
-[Adam] Yeah.

39:03.008 --> 39:07.377
Like, that they would've had
if they both were living.
And...

39:08.413 --> 39:09.979
now they're at it.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.681
Honestly,

39:12.384 --> 39:14.284
that is a huge deal,
what happened there.

39:14.286 --> 39:17.220
-Right, for sure.
-Like, we've never seen
that happen before.

39:17.222 --> 39:20.857
And like, it is that kind of
moment where you're
almost being like,

39:20.859 --> 39:25.628
a conduit for the other side
but also kind of like
a ghost therapist.

39:25.630 --> 39:28.698
-Like a family counselor,
you know?
-Right, for sure.

39:28.700 --> 39:33.036
But interesting enough,
we told Chip who the two were,
Katherine and Mamie,

39:33.038 --> 39:36.806
and we were like, "Can you
bridge a gap spiritually,

39:36.808 --> 39:38.575
and like,
see what's going on?"

39:38.577 --> 39:40.210
And this is what Chip
had to say.

39:42.180 --> 39:45.014
<i>  So, hey. We wanted to</i>
<i>  call you and kind of...</i>

39:45.016 --> 39:49.552
<i>  We have an interesting</i>
<i>  situation here at this house</i>
<i> that we've been investigating.</i>

39:49.554 --> 39:54.357
<i>  We found there's this</i>
<i>  spirit of a woman,</i>
<i>  named Mamie,</i>

39:54.359 --> 39:58.395
<i>  who was like, the matriarch</i>
<i>  of the family,</i>

39:58.397 --> 40:03.066
<i>  and then the spirit of</i>
<i>  her daughter, Katherine,</i>
<i>  who's also here.</i>

40:03.068 --> 40:06.803
<i>  The strange thing's that</i>
<i>  they don't know that</i>
<i>  each other's here.</i>

40:06.805 --> 40:07.937
<i>  They can't see each other.</i>

40:07.939 --> 40:09.773
-Wow.
-Yeah.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.208
So, I guess we're just
trying to see, like,

40:12.811 --> 40:15.545
is there anything that can
be done here?

40:15.547 --> 40:18.448
-I think you've done
it already.
<i> -[Amy] Okay.</i>

40:18.450 --> 40:22.752
<i> [Chip] What has to be done</i>
<i>  beyond this,</i>

40:22.754 --> 40:25.955
<i>  -is they have to work</i>
<i>  through this stuff.</i>
<i> -Yeah.</i>

40:25.957 --> 40:28.825
-Right.
<i> -[Chip] On their own.</i>
<i>  I mean...</i>

40:28.827 --> 40:31.928
They're gonna make a real
fragile little reconnection
and try to work things out,

40:31.930 --> 40:34.164
is what it feels like to me.

40:34.166 --> 40:35.398
-Okay, that's good to know.
-[Adam] Okay.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.635
It's a classic
mother-daughter relationship.

40:38.637 --> 40:42.338
And now they're together,
so hopefully,
they can talk about it.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.607
But we got no evidence
of what they are doing

40:44.609 --> 40:48.378
is going to affect anything
that you may wanna do for
this property in the future.

40:48.380 --> 40:51.681
Yeah, I think bottom line is,
you have a haunted house

40:51.683 --> 40:55.852
and you do have some
family spirits here that
are interacting.

40:55.854 --> 40:58.788
And this house has such
an amazing history.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.790
Like, you really do have
something special here.

41:00.792 --> 41:05.695
And it is a very safe,
wonderful place and I...

41:05.697 --> 41:07.864
-Yeah.
-I think you continue,
you forge ahead

41:07.866 --> 41:09.699
-and you don't have to
worry about your ghosts.
-[Drew] Right. Awesome.

41:09.701 --> 41:12.802
It's nice to know...

41:12.804 --> 41:18.908
that you guys have kind of
sorted out some of the details
that I...

41:18.910 --> 41:20.076
-was always kind of
curious about.
-[Amy] Mm-hmm.

41:20.078 --> 41:23.079
-Like, what was happening.
-Just remember, like...

41:23.682 --> 41:25.648
that your spirits here
are very human.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.651
-Like, these are
human spirits...
-Yeah.

41:28.653 --> 41:29.752
-...with very human issues.
-Mm-hmm.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.554
And they are still working
through it.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.756
-Right.
-And they feel compelled
to remain here.

41:33.758 --> 41:36.626
And I bet over time,
the activity actually
might subside.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.394
-Like, if they can
kind of work it out.
-Ever, ever.

41:38.396 --> 41:40.463
-But thank you for trusting us
with it.
-Well, thank you, yeah.

41:40.465 --> 41:43.032
-Yeah, you're welcome.
Thank you for coming.
-[Amy] It's been great.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.803
<i> [Adam] This case was pretty</i>
<i> insane because we were able to</i>

41:46.805 --> 41:48.638
<i>  experience something</i>
<i>  and do something</i>

41:48.640 --> 41:50.807
<i>  that Amy and I have never</i>
<i>  done before.</i>

41:50.809 --> 41:54.644
<i>  And the fact that it worked</i>
<i>  is pretty insane.</i>

41:54.646 --> 41:58.014
And Drew can sleep easy
knowing that
the family is here

41:58.016 --> 42:01.117
<i>  and there is still</i>
<i>  healing going on.</i>

42:02.053 --> 42:04.020
