01:46.539 --> 01:48.541
Have some eggplant.

01:48.541 --> 01:50.543
I told you,
i'm not hungry.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.046
Now you won't even accept food
from your own mother.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.547
Will you please
stick to the topic?

01:55.048 --> 01:56.049
Oh, sure, sure.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.551
You believe that
uncle of yours.

01:58.551 --> 02:01.054
I never conspired
with him.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.057
I wish somebody would tell me
what you're talking about.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.558
Ask your brother.

02:05.558 --> 02:07.560
I'm here to get your living
situation settled,

02:08.061 --> 02:09.062
now with janice gone.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.064
Barbara asked me
to come here.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.066
Beyond that, i got
nothing to say to you.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.068
Ma, you can't
come live with us.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.070
I'm sorry,
but tom won't allow it.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.571
Janice was right.

02:18.571 --> 02:21.574
I won't go back
to that place.

02:21.574 --> 02:22.575
You got that right.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.077
They won't have you
back at green grove.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.078
Tony!

02:25.078 --> 02:27.080
She was abusive
to the staff!

02:27.080 --> 02:28.581
Maybe tom
and i should just--

02:28.581 --> 02:30.083
no, no, no, no.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.584
Don't listen to
the manipulation.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.086
You got your own life!

02:33.586 --> 02:37.090
If you had a mother that had
one shred of gratitude in her,

02:37.090 --> 02:39.092
one shred,
but you don't.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.594
She's taking a page from
your wife's book.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.096
Oh, that is
fucking outrageous!

02:43.096 --> 02:44.597
Carmela asked you
how many fucking times

02:45.098 --> 02:49.602
to come live with us?

02:49.602 --> 02:51.104
Well, he's gone.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.106
Nice work, ma.

02:53.106 --> 02:57.110
Carmela's been
so sweet to you.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.612
I'm tired of this shit.

02:59.612 --> 03:03.116
Every fucking time.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.117
What?

03:04.617 --> 03:05.618
What are you doing?

03:05.618 --> 03:07.120
You're not gonna
live with her.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.122
There's two tickets,
first class.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.623
Go to tuscan,
stay with aunt gemma.

03:10.623 --> 03:13.126
Take aunt quinn with you,
the other fucking miserab'.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.128
I've done my part,
that's all you get from me.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.630
My sister quintina
won't fly.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.133
So, throw her out
on the fucking tarmac!

04:14.187 --> 04:15.688
To business.

04:46.719 --> 04:47.220
How are you?

04:47.720 --> 04:48.221
Alright.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.223
Oh, maddon'.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.225
Missed a great
meal too.

04:52.725 --> 04:53.726
Fantastic.

04:53.726 --> 04:54.727
Indian food.

04:54.727 --> 04:56.229
That envelope's
just the first week.

04:56.729 --> 04:57.730
I love it.

04:57.730 --> 04:58.731
Patsy been in?

04:58.731 --> 05:00.233
He's looking for you.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.235
Where'd the fuck they get
the fried zucchini flowers?

05:02.235 --> 05:03.736
It's fantastic.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.738
It's stuffed with
melted dry riccoti.

05:06.239 --> 05:06.739
Yeah?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.741
Help yourself,
you fat fuck.

05:08.741 --> 05:09.242
They good?

05:09.742 --> 05:11.244
Mmm.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.745
You too?

05:13.246 --> 05:15.248
Anybody else?
How about you?

05:15.748 --> 05:17.250
Tell arthur of the ritz

05:17.250 --> 05:19.252
to send a couple of plates
of zucchini flowers out.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.754
And some zuppa di mussels.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.256
You got it.

05:23.256 --> 05:28.261
So, telecommunications once
again fails to disappoint.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.762
What's this thing?

05:29.762 --> 05:31.264
Telephone calling cards.

05:31.264 --> 05:34.267
You find a front man
who can get a line of credit,

05:34.267 --> 05:37.270
you buy a couple of
million units of calling time
from a carrier.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.772
You become
"acme telephone card company".

05:39.772 --> 05:41.774
"Acme".

05:41.774 --> 05:44.777
You're now in the business of
selling prepaid calling cards.

05:44.777 --> 05:46.779
Immigrants especially,
no offense.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.782
They're always calling back
home to whoever the fuck.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.284
And it's expensive,
right?

05:51.284 --> 05:54.287
You sell thousands of these
cards to the greedy pricks,

05:54.287 --> 05:55.788
cards at a cut rate.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.291
But you bought the bulk time
on credit, remember?

05:58.291 --> 05:59.792
The carrier gets stiffed.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.295
He cuts off the service
to the card holders,

06:02.295 --> 06:04.297
but you already
sold all your cards.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.299
That's fucking beautiful!

06:07.300 --> 06:09.302
It's a good one.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.803
Oh.

06:10.803 --> 06:12.305
Prince rogain.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.309
Here you go,
some zuppa di mussels,

06:16.309 --> 06:19.312
and tony, you got
the last dozen flowers.

06:19.312 --> 06:20.813
Do me a favor,

06:20.813 --> 06:22.815
put these on the menu
for meadow's graduation party.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.318
Hey, those were some colleges
she got into, your kid.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.320
Yeah, you must
be very proud.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.322
Hey, holy cross.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.325
I mean, heather didn't exactly
walk away with un gatz.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.826
Excuse me.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.329
I give carmela
all the credit.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.331
Hey, you had something
to do with it too.

06:38.831 --> 06:39.332
Cheers.

06:39.832 --> 06:40.333
Salute.

06:40.333 --> 06:45.838
Salute.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.840
Things are good,
what the fuck?

06:47.840 --> 06:50.343
Richie aprile's in
the bermuda triangle.

06:50.343 --> 06:54.347
All my enemies
are smoked.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.848
Oh, oh, oh!

06:55.848 --> 06:56.849
Hey, patsy.

06:56.849 --> 06:57.850
What the fuck?

06:58.351 --> 06:59.352
Don't bring
that in here.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.354
Wait outside in the car,
i'll come out.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.856
What did i say?

07:03.856 --> 07:05.358
In the car.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.871
You still up?

07:18.871 --> 07:21.374
The gifts for
grad night.

07:21.374 --> 07:22.375
What's that?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.877
Oh, it's
a vestimenta suit.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.380
Got a price.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.383
You know it looks fatter
than a suit, right?

07:30.383 --> 07:34.387
I hate that when the air gets
trapped inside the suit bag,

07:34.387 --> 07:36.389
you know,
when you zip it up.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.390
Yeah.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.392
Don't you hate that?

07:39.892 --> 07:40.893
What?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.395
What do you want?

07:42.895 --> 07:44.397
Air in the bag.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.900
The only thing to do
is unzip it a little,

07:47.900 --> 07:53.906
let the air out.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.408
Holy shit.

07:55.908 --> 07:58.411
My suit's growing
a fucking beard.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.913
Oh, tony, will you
let me work here, please?

08:00.913 --> 08:03.916
Growing a beard or
a mirkin or something.

08:03.916 --> 08:04.917
Ah!

08:04.917 --> 08:05.918
It's fucking alive!

08:06.419 --> 08:07.420
It's alive!

08:07.420 --> 08:08.421
Oh, my god!

08:08.421 --> 08:09.422
Oh, my god.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.424
Tony, what did you do?

08:11.424 --> 08:12.925
It's for you.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.927
Oh, my god.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.429
Yeah.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.431
We're having
a good week.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.433
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

08:31.944 --> 08:35.948
You look beautiful, carm.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.950
Come here.

09:25.998 --> 09:28.501
You believe this shit?

09:28.501 --> 09:30.002
Fucking june.

09:30.002 --> 09:31.504
My daughter's
graduating in a week.

09:32.004 --> 09:33.005
Spring snow.

09:33.005 --> 09:34.507
Happened when
my parents got married.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.008
Won't last.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.016
So, they here yet?

09:44.016 --> 09:45.017
Not yet.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.018
Ton'.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.020
I'm sorry.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.522
When they make
the diagnosis?

09:50.022 --> 09:51.023
About a month ago.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.526
The wife and kids know?

09:53.526 --> 09:54.527
No.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.529
And there's nothing
they can do for you?

09:56.529 --> 09:59.532
The various protocols
to date are ineffective.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.534
What can i say?

10:01.534 --> 10:03.536
You have my sympathy.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.037
September 5th.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.039
That's how long they've
given him to live.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.041
But instead of
waiting until then,

10:09.041 --> 10:11.043
he's gonna light
himself on fire.

10:11.043 --> 10:12.545
Yeah.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.047
Is that balls of
concrete or what?

10:15.047 --> 10:17.049
Very considerate.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.552
How many guys are gonn
a do that for you, heh?

10:19.552 --> 10:25.558
Spare you all those
fuckin' visits to the hospital.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.561
By the way, patsy,
coat went over big.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.062
She loved it.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.566
I'm philly.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.568
Sorry, right,
philly.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.069
Yeah.

10:37.069 --> 10:38.571
Thought you were
your brother.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.073
You know, i just
bought a sable off him.

10:41.073 --> 10:44.076
I'm sorry i had
to do that.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.584
Fuck this.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.586
They're never coming.

11:09.101 --> 11:10.603
Where's pussy?

11:20.112 --> 11:21.614
Hey, ton'.

11:21.614 --> 11:28.621
What if these doctors
are wrong?

11:28.621 --> 11:29.622
Carm.

11:29.622 --> 11:34.627
What?

11:34.627 --> 11:37.630
Might as well just
fucking kill myself.

11:37.630 --> 11:40.633
I've never been so
fucking depressed.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.635
Tony.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.136
Sorry.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.138
It's alright,
go back to bed.

11:46.138 --> 11:50.142
No, no, what?
What now?

11:50.643 --> 11:52.144
It's all a big nothing.

11:52.144 --> 11:53.646
What is?

11:54.146 --> 11:55.648
Life.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.150
Tony, that is
your mother talking.

11:58.150 --> 12:02.154
Everything's black.

12:02.154 --> 12:06.158
You have a tendency
towards depression, yes.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.660
But listen to me,
alright?

12:08.160 --> 12:09.662
Everything's gonna
be alright.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.664
I'm here,
i'm with you.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.166
The kids are safe
in their beds.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.668
They love you.

12:16.168 --> 12:21.173
What?

12:21.674 --> 12:25.678
It's coming
from here.

12:25.678 --> 12:27.680
It's not my fucking head.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.182
It's my stomach.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.684
I'm nauseous.

12:31.684 --> 12:32.685
Jesus.

12:32.685 --> 12:36.689
Fuck!

12:37.189 --> 12:41.694
Oh, fuck,
it's the chicken vindaloo.

12:42.194 --> 12:45.698
Fucking
motherfucking wogs!

12:45.698 --> 12:47.700
Mom, what's going on?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.201
Your father is sick.

12:49.201 --> 12:50.703
Oh, my god, daddy,
what happened?

12:50.703 --> 12:52.705
He went to
an indian restaurant.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.707
That is so racist.

12:56.208 --> 12:57.710
Who's letting
those big ones?

12:57.710 --> 13:01.213
There better be coke
left in that fridge
is all i can say.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.224
How did it go?

13:20.733 --> 13:22.234
Was sundip there?

13:22.234 --> 13:23.235
Yeah.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.747
My whole cut.

13:40.252 --> 13:44.256
Here.

13:44.256 --> 13:45.257
What's the matter?

13:45.257 --> 13:46.759
"What's the matter?"

13:46.759 --> 13:48.761
I know, i know,
tony's your best friend.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.263
President franklin
is my best friend.

13:51.263 --> 13:52.765
And he's in there.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.266
Look...

13:54.266 --> 13:56.769
some cooperators, when they
finally get their new identity,

13:57.269 --> 13:58.771
do pretty fucking good.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.273
One snitch
i worked with

14:01.273 --> 14:03.275
became recycling
and garbage commissioner

14:03.275 --> 14:05.277
of a good sized
city in florida.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.287
You alright?

14:15.287 --> 14:19.291
Yeah, it's

14:19.792 --> 14:21.293
Here.

14:21.293 --> 14:27.299
Here, small sips.

14:27.299 --> 14:29.802
Wondered about
that chicken.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.804
Probably a fucking
cocker spaniel.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.806
Oh, stop it, tony,
here, lie back.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.308
You feel a little hot.

14:36.308 --> 14:39.812
Fucking goddess
with the six arms.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.814
No wonder.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.817
Here.

14:44.817 --> 14:45.818
Sip.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.820
I said sip, tony.

14:57.830 --> 15:01.834
What?

15:01.834 --> 15:04.336
I said, you still
like your coat?

15:04.336 --> 15:09.842
I love my coat.

15:43.375 --> 15:45.878
Where you going?

15:45.878 --> 15:47.379
I don't know.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.381
What are you
looking for?

15:49.381 --> 15:50.382
Somebody's
looking for me.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.386
Who?

15:54.386 --> 15:58.390
I don't know.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.895
Our true enemy has yet
to reveal himself.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.950
Three hearts.

16:57.950 --> 17:01.954
And a seven.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.956
Make it a dime.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.473
Tony, are you up yet?

17:30.482 --> 17:32.484
How are you feeling?

17:38.991 --> 17:41.493
I had fucked up
dreams last night.

17:41.493 --> 17:44.997
Fever dreams.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.999
I shot this guy.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.500
He's a friend of mine.

17:49.001 --> 17:52.504
Now, in real life, this guy does
do some things that annoy me.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.007
Like every christmas, he sends
out these typed reports

17:55.007 --> 17:57.509
of what his nieces
and nephews have been doing.

17:57.509 --> 18:02.014
Who got into west point,
who got a hole in one.

18:02.014 --> 18:04.516
And he hums...

18:04.516 --> 18:06.518
tv commercials.

18:07.019 --> 18:10.522
Drives me fucking crazy.

18:10.522 --> 18:13.525
But he's...

18:13.525 --> 18:16.028
one of my best guys,
a terrific earner.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.031
So, what the fuck
would i do that for?

18:24.036 --> 18:26.538
I was filled with--

18:26.538 --> 18:27.539
anger.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.541
Yeah, right, anger
, you know everything.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.543
You have never dealt
with your anger.

18:31.543 --> 18:33.045
And look at the cost.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.047
You are the biggest
threat to yourself.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.049
That's what being
a human being is.

18:37.549 --> 18:44.056
But some people are more
self- destructive than others.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.558
You're gonna make me
eat something now?

18:46.558 --> 18:48.060
Maybe.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.062
If you keep this up.

18:50.562 --> 18:51.063
No.

19:00.072 --> 19:03.575
I'm dying.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.578
I'm gonna cover you
with this blanket, okay?

19:06.578 --> 19:09.081
I don't want you to
see me like this.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.082
Please.

19:10.582 --> 19:12.584
I'm fucking freezing.

19:12.584 --> 19:15.587
Your teeth are
chattering.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.589
You want to go
back into the bed?

19:17.589 --> 19:20.092
Might as well
just leave me here.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.094
Motherfucking fucking!

19:22.094 --> 19:27.099
I think you have
food poisoning.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.600
Fucking dreams,
jesus christ.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.102
It's alright.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.103
It's alright.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.112
Where is he?

19:40.612 --> 19:41.113
Who?

19:41.113 --> 19:42.614
Pussy.

20:04.636 --> 20:05.137
Hey.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.139
What are you
doing here?

20:07.139 --> 20:09.641
Finalize the menu.

20:09.641 --> 20:12.644
Oh, shit,
i completely forgot.

20:12.644 --> 20:16.148
Tony had food poisonin
g all night, the poor guy.

20:16.648 --> 20:18.650
Ooh, oh, hey,
it's not from my place.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.652
Was he at vesuvio
last night?

20:20.652 --> 20:22.154
Yeah.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.156
But i got an "a" rating.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.157
It's...

20:25.157 --> 20:26.658
sure, of course,
nobody's saying.

20:26.658 --> 20:27.659
Is that artie?

20:28.160 --> 20:29.161
Hey, ton'.

20:29.161 --> 20:29.661
Send him up!

20:29.661 --> 20:31.663
Tony, go to sleep.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.665
You don't even make
any sense when you talk.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.168
Send him up!

20:48.680 --> 20:51.683
Oh, jeez, you picked up
a bad one somewhere, huh?

20:51.683 --> 20:52.684
Somewhere?

20:53.185 --> 20:54.686
You know, maybe.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.688
Just out of consideration
for others,

20:56.688 --> 20:58.690
you'd dump those fucking
mussels you gave me

20:58.690 --> 21:00.192
before you cause
a fucking outbreak.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.193
Whoa, nellie.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.195
I hand pick every piece
of shellfish myself.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.196
Oh, yeah?

21:04.696 --> 21:05.697
You smelling them
as you're picking them

21:05.697 --> 21:07.699
or you're staring
off into space?

21:07.699 --> 21:09.701
Worrying about paying
your fucking rent

21:09.701 --> 21:11.703
or whatever it is
you fucking worry about.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.205
That's a serious
allegation.

21:13.705 --> 21:15.707
Nobody's gonna
fucking sue you.

21:15.707 --> 21:17.209
You see, this is what
i'm talking about.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.210
Tony, you ate mussels?

21:18.210 --> 21:19.211
Prince edward island.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.712
Top of the line.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.714
After an entir
e indian dinner?

21:22.714 --> 21:24.216
You ate at
an indian restaurant?

21:24.716 --> 21:25.717
There you go.

21:25.717 --> 21:26.718
It was the mussels.

21:26.718 --> 21:29.221
They came up undigested.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.723
They came up undigested,
how could they be the cause?

21:31.723 --> 21:34.226
It's why my body shut down,
self protection.

21:34.226 --> 21:36.728
You know what they cook with
at indian restaurants?

21:36.728 --> 21:37.729
Ghee.

21:37.729 --> 21:39.731
It's clarified butter.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.733
I mean, you get a rancid
hit of that and...

21:41.733 --> 21:43.235
you can imagine.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.736
You know,
it's interesting too

21:44.736 --> 21:46.238
'cause when indira ghandi
got assassinated,

21:46.738 --> 21:47.739
i was watching
the satellite feed

21:47.739 --> 21:50.242
when they broadcast
the cremation.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.744
Did you know that they douse
the body and the funeral pyre

21:52.744 --> 21:57.249
in clarified butter
just to get it burning?

22:01.253 --> 22:03.755
Did you call pussy?
He had the mussels too.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.757
Jesus, artie,"call pussy",
some concern maybe?

22:05.757 --> 22:10.262
I am, i feel very
bad for him.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.764
Sal.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.267
It's arthur bucco.

22:15.267 --> 22:16.768
What the fuck?

22:21.773 --> 22:22.774
Hello.

22:22.774 --> 22:24.276
Hey, man,
it's artie.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.278
Yeah, i know,
what's up?

22:26.278 --> 22:27.279
Listen, i'm at
the soprano's house.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.781
And tony's a little
green around the gills.

22:30.282 --> 22:31.283
Flu, i'm guessing.

22:31.283 --> 22:34.286
But maybe he ate something
didn't agree with him.

22:34.286 --> 22:35.787
Food poisoning?

22:35.787 --> 22:37.289
No, what, salmonella?

22:37.289 --> 22:39.291
No!

22:39.291 --> 22:40.792
But he had a reaction.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.294
You guys ate at
an indian restaurant.

22:42.294 --> 22:45.797
It would help if we knew,
did you have any symptoms?

22:45.797 --> 22:46.798
No.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.800
Well, once during the night,

22:48.800 --> 22:51.303
i did have a slight
touch of diarrhea.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.305
That's all, it passed.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.306
Nothing.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.808
Touch of diarrhea.

22:56.808 --> 22:58.310
You motherfucker.

22:58.810 --> 22:59.811
A touch.

22:59.811 --> 23:00.812
Nothing right, puss?

23:00.812 --> 23:02.814
Not what like tony's
going through, right?

23:02.814 --> 23:04.316
Like from bad shell- fish
or anything.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.318
What the fuck?
Am i gonna get sick now?

23:06.318 --> 23:07.319
No!

23:07.319 --> 23:09.321
Listen, did you guys
eat the same thing

23:09.321 --> 23:10.822
at the indian restaurant?

23:10.822 --> 23:12.824
Well, we both
had the papadums,

23:12.824 --> 23:15.327
but different courses.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.329
Both had the papadums,
different entrees.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.331
Stop talking
about food.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.332
Okay, puss.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.834
Yeah, i'm sorry
to bother you.

23:22.834 --> 23:27.339
Okay, thanks a lot,
okay.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.841
I'm sorry, tony,
but i feel vindicated.

23:29.841 --> 23:32.344
I can't get of
f the boardwalk.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.845
I'm gonna call
dr. Cusamano.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.348
This is worrying me now.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.350
Poor sonofabitch.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.852
Oh, you gotta
go again?

23:40.852 --> 23:42.354
Just let me die.

23:42.854 --> 23:43.355
No.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.356
C'mon.

23:44.356 --> 23:45.357
Ally oop.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.359
Up, up, up, up.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.860
So, where we headed?

23:48.860 --> 23:51.363
This way.

23:53.365 --> 23:55.367
Ladies and gentlemen,
in a few moments

23:55.367 --> 23:57.369
we'll begin general
boarding on flight 129

23:57.369 --> 23:58.870
with non- stop service
to tucson.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.372
At this time,

24:00.372 --> 24:02.874
we'd like to begin boarding our
first class passengers only.

24:02.874 --> 24:04.376
Those traveling
with young children

24:04.376 --> 24:06.378
and those requirin
g special assistance.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.380
You can't understand
a word they say.

24:08.380 --> 24:09.881
Go on.

24:09.881 --> 24:11.883
Livia soprano?

24:22.894 --> 24:28.400
Oh, pussy.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.901
Oh.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.408
C'mon in.

24:47.419 --> 24:48.920
So...

24:48.920 --> 24:53.925
who's your friend?

24:53.925 --> 24:55.427
Pussy?

24:55.927 --> 24:57.429
I'm confused.

24:57.429 --> 25:00.432
Isn't pussy
your friend?

25:00.932 --> 25:01.933
Yeah.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.935
But that's the friend
that was almost carried off

25:03.935 --> 25:08.440
by the ducks, right?

25:08.440 --> 25:10.942
You know what the worst
part of this is?

25:10.942 --> 25:13.445
This is one of those situations
where i know i'm dreaming.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.447
Well, let's look at it.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.449
When you say pussy
you mean my friend, pussy,

25:17.449 --> 25:19.451
or you know...

25:19.451 --> 25:21.453
pussy.

25:21.453 --> 25:25.457
Whatever seems to be
dominating your thoughts.

25:25.457 --> 25:26.958
I got pussy on the brain.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.461
I always do.

25:29.461 --> 25:33.965
I wanna fuck you,
i always did...

25:33.965 --> 25:35.467
do.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.469
I told you that
the first time we met.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.971
I find you immensely
attractive, anthony.

25:39.971 --> 25:41.973
I thought
i repulsed you.

25:41.973 --> 25:43.475
You go out of your way
to repulse me.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.976
But you like that.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.478
You just admitted
you find me attractive.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.480
You're the one
that's fucked up.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.482
Anthony, anthony.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.985
What are we gonna
do with you?

26:12.504 --> 26:15.006
What's he
smiling at?

26:15.006 --> 26:19.010
No, he's gritting his teeth,
he's freezing.

26:19.511 --> 26:24.015
Tony.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.517
Hey, guy.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.519
Not feeling
too good, huh?

26:27.519 --> 26:30.021
I'm dying.

26:30.522 --> 26:33.525
No, no, you got
a small case of e. Coli,
campylobacteria, maybe,

26:33.525 --> 26:35.527
but you're gonna be fine.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.028
Let me die.

26:37.028 --> 26:38.530
Should he maybe
go to the hospital?

26:38.530 --> 26:39.531
Nothing we'd do.

26:40.031 --> 26:41.032
Pump his stomach?

26:41.032 --> 26:43.034
Not with this.

26:43.034 --> 26:44.536
He should suck
ice chips.

26:45.036 --> 26:49.541
It's good for the fever,
keeps him hydrated.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.542
Anyhoo...

26:50.542 --> 26:52.043
fucking ragheads.

26:52.043 --> 26:53.545
I don't think so, tony.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.547
Those spices kill
microbial agents.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.048
Very smart.

26:57.048 --> 26:59.050
That fucking
artie bucco.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.052
Meadow's graduation
is tomorrow.

27:01.052 --> 27:02.554
Ah.

27:27.078 --> 27:29.581
Hey, ton'.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.591
How's it going?

27:40.091 --> 27:41.593
You didn't get sick?

27:41.593 --> 27:42.594
Nah.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.595
How much you weigh?

27:44.095 --> 27:44.596
Eight pounds.

27:44.596 --> 27:46.097
Lost a lot of weight.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.098
Swimming.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.600
The best exercise.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.101
Works every
muscle group.

27:50.101 --> 27:51.603
Get the fuck
out of here.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.104
You never exercise
d once in your life.

27:53.104 --> 28:00.111
Anyway,
four dollars a pound.

28:00.111 --> 28:03.114
You know i've been working with
the government right, ton'?

28:03.615 --> 28:07.118
Don't say it.

28:07.118 --> 28:08.620
C'mon, ton'.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.622
Sooner or later
you gotta face facts.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.123
I don't want
to hear it.

28:12.123 --> 28:16.127
Well, you're gonna hear it.

28:16.127 --> 28:17.629
Fuck.

28:17.629 --> 28:22.634
You passed me over for
promotion, ton', you knew.

28:22.634 --> 28:24.135
How much shit
you give them?

28:24.636 --> 28:26.638
A lot.

28:27.138 --> 28:28.640
Jesus, puss.

28:34.145 --> 28:36.648
Fuck of a way for
it all to end, huh?

28:37.148 --> 28:37.649
Yeah.

28:38.149 --> 28:39.651
Yeah.

28:39.651 --> 28:42.654
These guys,
on either side of me,

28:42.654 --> 28:44.656
they're asleep.

28:44.656 --> 28:45.657
Don't say that.

28:45.657 --> 28:52.664
It's not fucking funny.

28:53.164 --> 28:56.167
I don't want to see you
floppin' around down there!

29:10.682 --> 29:13.184
No way, tony.

29:13.184 --> 29:15.186
Get your ass
back in bed.

29:15.186 --> 29:17.188
Cramps are gone,
i got to go out.

29:17.188 --> 29:18.690
Help me with this.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.692
Tony, you are out
of your mind.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.694
I brought you
some consomme.

29:22.694 --> 29:28.199
I wasn't even sure
you could handle that.

29:28.199 --> 29:31.202
God help you, tony, if your head
is in that bowl for graduation

29:31.202 --> 29:33.204
because i sure
as hell won't.

29:37.709 --> 29:38.710
Tony.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.211
Hi, ang, how you doing?

29:40.712 --> 29:41.713
Good, good,
how are you?

29:41.713 --> 29:43.715
Oh, madonn',
my poor ass.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.717
Is the man at home?

29:45.717 --> 29:47.218
Yeah, come in,
he's still sleeping.

29:47.218 --> 29:50.722
I'll go get him.

29:50.722 --> 29:55.727
Give me a minute, ang!

29:55.727 --> 29:57.729
Hey, tony,
how you feeling?

29:57.729 --> 29:58.730
Better.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.231
Good,
you look better.

30:00.231 --> 30:02.233
I mean--
than i thought you would.

30:02.233 --> 30:03.234
Artie called.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.236
Hopalong che- se- dic',
how you doing?

30:05.236 --> 30:06.237
Can't complain.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.740
You want some coffee?
You in the neighborhood?

30:08.740 --> 30:11.242
No, no, i got a call
about a boat, a sea ray 50.

30:11.242 --> 30:12.744
I want you guy's
opinion on it.

30:12.744 --> 30:13.745
What, now?

30:13.745 --> 30:15.747
The owner's
got two offers.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.248
I gotta decide
this morning.

30:17.248 --> 30:18.249
Cuban guy.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.751
Oh, yeah.

30:19.751 --> 30:20.752
Okay.

30:20.752 --> 30:22.253
Just throw some
clothes on.

30:22.253 --> 30:23.254
C'mon.

30:23.254 --> 30:24.255
Okay.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.257
Oh, jesus.

30:26.257 --> 30:32.263
Round 12.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.766
You know, i could use
that cup of coffee.

30:34.766 --> 30:36.267
Yeah, right.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.770
We don't need
to see this.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.773
I promised gab i'd pick up
10 bags of the garden mulch

30:41.773 --> 30:44.275
from home depot before
i did anything this morning.

30:44.275 --> 30:45.276
See?

30:45.276 --> 30:47.278
And you're sitting there,
shame on you.

30:47.278 --> 30:49.781
How long is
he taking up there?

30:59.791 --> 31:02.293
I'm looking forward
to the graduation party.

31:38.830 --> 31:44.335
So, who's ready
to go buy a boat?

31:44.335 --> 31:49.841
Might as well
tell you now.

31:49.841 --> 31:52.343
I bought the most
beautiful boat today.

31:52.343 --> 31:53.344
Cool.

31:53.344 --> 31:54.846
The 50 footer?

31:54.846 --> 31:56.347
The very same.

31:56.347 --> 31:57.849
I might as
well tell you.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.851
I decided on columbia.

31:59.851 --> 32:00.852
Oh!

32:08.359 --> 32:10.361
You want?

32:10.361 --> 32:12.864
It's a little early
in the day, no?

32:12.864 --> 32:14.365
Sea legs.

32:14.365 --> 32:20.371
Yeah, what the fuck.

32:20.371 --> 32:22.373
You sure you want
to go out today, t.?

32:22.874 --> 32:24.375
Just getting
over the trots.

32:24.375 --> 32:28.379
Time and tide wait
for no man, right?

32:28.379 --> 32:30.882
It's got a decent
displacement for its size.

32:31.382 --> 32:33.384
Mill puts out about
700 horsepower.

32:33.384 --> 32:34.385
Beautiful boat, tony.

32:34.385 --> 32:36.387
I've been waiting
40 minutes.

32:36.387 --> 32:37.889
The cuban had to go
see the harbor master,

32:38.389 --> 32:43.394
but we're free to
give it a spin.

32:43.895 --> 32:44.896
C'mon, puss.

32:57.408 --> 33:00.912
Rides nice.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.915
Let's go down below,
check out the mahagony.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.416
C'mon.

33:40.952 --> 33:44.956
Take a seat, puss.

33:44.956 --> 33:48.459
Should we test- drop the anchor,
see how she holds?

33:48.960 --> 33:52.964
Later.

33:52.964 --> 33:59.470
Yeah, right.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.972
Why you making me
do this,

34:00.972 --> 34:02.974
you fat, fucking,
miserable piece of shit?

34:02.974 --> 34:04.976
What, tony, what?

34:13.985 --> 34:14.985
When did
they flip you?

34:14.985 --> 34:17.487
Tell me,
don't lie.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.489
Flip?

34:18.989 --> 34:20.992
Who?
What?

34:54.525 --> 34:58.529
They had me,
tony.

34:58.529 --> 35:03.534
I was going away
for pushing h.

35:04.035 --> 35:05.536
How long?

35:05.536 --> 35:07.038
30 to life,
i had no choice.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.539
How long?

35:08.539 --> 35:12.043
How much
do they know?

35:12.043 --> 35:15.046
A year and a half,
no less.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.547
A year and
a fucking half

35:16.547 --> 35:18.549
you been running your own
fucking gossip column?

35:18.549 --> 35:21.552
Motherfucker!

35:22.053 --> 35:25.556
Let me explain.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.558
I fed them bullshit.

35:27.558 --> 35:28.559
Nothing.

35:29.060 --> 35:32.063
Whatcallmallit,
disinformation so i could live,

35:32.063 --> 35:35.566
keep earning on any
subsistence level whatsoever.

35:35.566 --> 35:37.068
I will
do nothing, tony,

35:37.068 --> 35:39.070
nothing to put you
in harm's way,
all of yous!

35:39.070 --> 35:42.073
That's how they got tipped off
about the bevilaqua hit, huh?

35:42.073 --> 35:43.574
'Cause you did nothing.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.578
On my mother's eyes,
that wasn't me!

35:49.580 --> 35:51.582
Little things,
pickyoon shit.

35:51.582 --> 35:55.086
Be specific.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.587
They know about
the calling cards.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.089
I'm not in that.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.590
What else?

35:59.590 --> 36:00.591
That's it.

36:00.591 --> 36:01.592
That's is,
recently.

36:01.592 --> 36:05.096
What not recently?

36:05.096 --> 36:06.597
I'm thinking.

36:08.599 --> 36:09.600
Fucking noise!

36:09.600 --> 36:10.601
Where you going?

36:10.601 --> 36:14.105
The other shit, none of it
amounted to anything.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.107
I've been careful,
i've got this down.

36:16.107 --> 36:20.111
I'm mind- fucking these donkeys
like you wouldn't believe.

36:20.111 --> 36:24.115
Webistics?

36:24.115 --> 36:26.617
Oh, jesus christ.

36:27.118 --> 36:31.622
But mostly i talked up
the scatino bust- out,

36:31.622 --> 36:33.624
nothing federal there
to link you, tony.

36:34.125 --> 36:35.626
They need
serial numbers.

36:35.626 --> 36:39.130
I'm telling you,
this disinformation shit

36:39.630 --> 36:43.134
is an effective technique,
it's a freaking ace!

37:08.159 --> 37:12.163
What's the matter
with you?

37:12.163 --> 37:14.165
It's this
fucking swell.

37:14.665 --> 37:15.666
I got food poisoning.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.168
You don't see me
getting all fucked up.

37:17.168 --> 37:18.669
Don't yell at me!

37:18.669 --> 37:21.172
I'll fucking yell at you,
you don't like it?

37:46.197 --> 37:48.699
We got any
good tequila?

38:19.730 --> 38:24.735
You know that acupuncturist
down in puerto rico?

38:25.236 --> 38:26.237
26...

38:26.737 --> 38:31.242
tell you, this broad,
her ass was the second coming.

38:31.742 --> 38:38.249
Never wore panties.

38:38.249 --> 38:39.750
Brushed her teeth
with this shit.

38:39.750 --> 38:42.253
Every night she'd drink me
under the fucking table.

38:42.253 --> 38:46.257
And i'd eat her out
when i was down there.

38:54.765 --> 38:57.768
Hey, puss.

38:57.768 --> 39:00.771
Did she even
really exist?

39:06.777 --> 39:08.779
Fucked up.

39:27.798 --> 39:29.300
Not in the face,
okay?

39:29.300 --> 39:32.303
You give me that?

39:32.303 --> 39:33.804
Huh?

39:33.804 --> 39:36.807
Keep my eyes?

39:36.807 --> 39:40.311
You were like
a brother to me.

39:40.311 --> 39:46.817
To all of us.

39:46.817 --> 39:48.319
Yeah.

39:53.824 --> 39:55.826
I'm starting t
o feel it now too.

39:56.327 --> 40:00.831
My inner
ear balance is off.

40:13.844 --> 40:20.351
What?

40:20.851 --> 40:23.854
Jesus christ.

40:23.854 --> 40:26.857
I gotta sit down.

40:26.857 --> 40:29.360
I feel like
i can't stand.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.362
Is that okay, tony?

40:31.362 --> 40:32.863
That i sit?

40:48.879 --> 40:50.381
Get the weights.

42:40.991 --> 42:44.495
You're not gonna forget
to go to comp world,
get the gift?

42:44.495 --> 42:45.996
If we gave her the one
i could've got

42:46.497 --> 42:48.999
it would've had a smaller screen
but it would've cost us nothing.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.001
Don't snap
at me, okay?

42:51.001 --> 42:57.007
Don't press your luck
with this diarrhea.

42:57.007 --> 42:58.509
I can't shake it.

42:58.509 --> 42:59.510
Whose fault is that?

43:04.515 --> 43:06.016
Hello.

43:06.016 --> 43:07.017
Put anthony on.

43:07.518 --> 43:09.019
Don't call here.

43:09.019 --> 43:11.522
I am at
newark airport.

43:12.022 --> 43:17.528
We've been held here
since 9:00 this morning.

43:17.528 --> 43:20.030
Your mother is still
at the airport.

43:20.030 --> 43:22.032
Tough shit.

43:22.032 --> 43:25.035
Go get anthony,
i need a lawyer.

43:25.035 --> 43:28.038
I'm in
airport security.

43:28.539 --> 43:30.040
She's at
airport security.

43:30.040 --> 43:34.044
I can't do it,
i can't call.

43:34.044 --> 43:35.546
I don't know
what to do.

43:35.546 --> 43:41.051
They say that anthony
gave me a stolen ticket.

43:41.051 --> 43:43.554
They're gonna
call the fbi.

43:43.554 --> 43:46.056
Here, you better--
i don't know.

43:46.056 --> 43:50.561
The fun never stops.

43:50.561 --> 43:51.562
What?

43:51.562 --> 43:53.564
Anthony,
the tickets are stolen.

43:53.564 --> 43:55.065
What the fuck?

43:55.065 --> 43:56.066
What did you say?

43:56.066 --> 43:57.568
Did you?

43:57.568 --> 43:59.069
Ma, i'll send someone
down there to pick you up.

43:59.069 --> 44:00.571
But i don't know
what you're talking about.

44:00.571 --> 44:02.573
Okay?

44:02.573 --> 44:06.076
Jesus christ.

44:06.076 --> 44:08.579
How fucking hard is it
to get on an airplane?

44:15.085 --> 44:16.086
What do you want?

44:16.086 --> 44:17.588
Agent harris.

44:17.588 --> 44:19.089
Anthony soprano.

44:19.089 --> 44:21.091
We have a warrant
to search your house,

44:21.091 --> 44:23.093
property, and
your family vehicle.

44:23.093 --> 44:24.595
What are you looking
for today, boss?

44:24.595 --> 44:26.096
Stolen airline tickets,

44:26.096 --> 44:28.098
constituting mail fraud,
wire fraud,

44:28.599 --> 44:30.100
and any other
federal violation.

44:30.100 --> 44:33.103
Let's see
your warrant.

44:33.103 --> 44:34.605
You can also
see the tickets.

44:34.605 --> 44:36.607
We found them
in your suburban.

44:36.607 --> 44:38.609
You have the right
to remain silent.

44:38.609 --> 44:40.110
I bought them,
talk to my lawyer.

44:40.110 --> 44:42.112
You have the right
to an attorney.

44:42.112 --> 44:44.114
What, are you a fuckin' parrot?
What'd i just say?

44:44.114 --> 44:47.117
We're entitled to search
the rest of the domicile.

44:47.618 --> 44:52.122
Let's go.

44:52.623 --> 44:53.624
Upstairs.

44:53.624 --> 44:56.627
Michael,
over here.

44:56.627 --> 44:58.629
Our daughter is
graduating high school.

44:58.629 --> 45:01.131
You can't wait a few days
to persecute him?

45:01.131 --> 45:02.633
To persecute us?

45:02.633 --> 45:07.638
Jerry,
get the door.

45:07.638 --> 45:15.646
I'm gonna keep trying, mink,
i don't trust that secretary.

45:15.646 --> 45:16.647
Oh, my god.

45:17.147 --> 45:18.148
Med, it's alright,

45:18.148 --> 45:20.150
i'll be home in
a couple hours,
don't worry.

45:20.150 --> 45:22.653
I'm graduating tomorrow!

45:29.159 --> 45:34.665
Let's get outta here.

45:34.665 --> 45:37.668
What, do you guys need another
picture of me for your wallets?

45:37.668 --> 45:44.174
Other hand.

45:44.174 --> 45:45.676
Tony soprano,
weak in the knees,

45:45.676 --> 45:47.678
can't stand
the heat?

45:47.678 --> 45:49.179
I got food poisoning.

45:49.179 --> 45:51.181
You think this bothers me,
you fuck head?

45:51.682 --> 45:55.185
This way.

46:06.697 --> 46:08.198
I gotta
tell you, frank,

46:08.198 --> 46:12.202
i'd forget about any deli tray
coming your way in the future.

46:29.219 --> 46:30.721
Meadow,
are you sleeping?

46:30.721 --> 46:32.222
Yes.

46:32.222 --> 46:39.229
I want to
talk to you.

46:39.229 --> 46:43.233
God, am i so not
going to miss this.

46:53.243 --> 46:56.246
You have to understand
that your father means well.

46:56.246 --> 47:06.256
He's given his life for you,
for your brother, for us.

47:06.256 --> 47:07.758
All i'm saying,

47:08.258 --> 47:12.262
how you reacted downstairs,
now you're sitting
up here by yourself.

47:12.262 --> 47:15.766
I know it was
embarrassing for you, but...

47:15.766 --> 47:20.771
anyway, if you ever
wanted to talk--

47:21.271 --> 47:22.272
this is
who dad is.

47:22.272 --> 47:24.775
My friends
don't judge me.

47:24.775 --> 47:32.282
And fuck them if they do,
i'll cut them off.

47:32.282 --> 47:34.284
I knew i was giving her
a bad ticket.

47:34.284 --> 47:38.789
That voice
, that voice.

47:38.789 --> 47:41.291
It's done, tony, over.

47:41.291 --> 47:42.793
My advice now
is to put it behind you.

47:43.293 --> 47:45.295
If this is all there is,
these 23 tickets,

47:45.295 --> 47:49.800
they don't have "bubkes"
and they know it.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.302
I know it's a small thing,
but that's the fucking point.

47:52.803 --> 47:56.306
One more minute,
if i could've just stood there

47:56.306 --> 47:59.309
saying,"yes, ma,
okay, ma, i hear you, ma",

47:59.309 --> 48:01.812
one more minute,
i wouldn't be in this spot.

48:01.812 --> 48:05.315
I beat a homicide
and now i fucked up, neil.

48:05.315 --> 48:06.817
I blew
an easy one.

48:06.817 --> 48:07.818
I blew everything.

48:07.818 --> 48:09.319
Tony.

48:09.319 --> 48:11.822
No, we got fuckin'
federal charges,
we got the faa.

48:12.322 --> 48:13.824
Before this is over

48:13.824 --> 48:15.325
they're gonna pin that
egypt air thing on me

48:15.325 --> 48:19.329
and you fucking
know it!

48:19.329 --> 48:22.332
I got predicates
up the ass,

48:22.332 --> 48:23.834
fucking rico case.

48:23.834 --> 48:24.835
30 to life.

48:24.835 --> 48:26.837
Don't think
about that now.

48:26.837 --> 48:29.339
You'll make bail.

48:29.339 --> 48:31.842
There's no
capital crimes.

48:32.342 --> 48:37.848
Get on with life.

48:57.868 --> 49:00.871
My mother,
my fucking goddamn idiot

49:00.871 --> 49:02.372
of a mother.

49:02.372 --> 49:04.875
You'd think she was never
married to johnny soprano.

49:04.875 --> 49:09.379
Is there something else
bothering you, anthony?

49:09.379 --> 49:11.381
That's not enough?

49:11.381 --> 49:14.384
Fucking demented,
old bat.

49:14.384 --> 49:17.888
You're so angry
with your mother
and the airline tickets.

49:17.888 --> 49:21.391
I'm not saying
that it's not serious,

49:21.391 --> 49:25.395
but a year ago your mother
colluded to have you killed,

49:25.395 --> 49:27.397
yet you never say
"boo" about that,

49:27.397 --> 49:32.903
even when
i try to elicit.

49:32.903 --> 49:35.405
If she tried to have
you killed a year ago,

49:35.906 --> 49:38.408
believe me,
in your childhood,

49:38.408 --> 49:43.914
she's inflicted serious
psychic injuries
that are still there.

49:43.914 --> 49:47.417
Poor me.

49:54.424 --> 49:56.927
And your father,
the gangster, tough guy.

49:56.927 --> 50:00.430
Did he protect you kids
from borderline mother?

50:00.430 --> 50:01.932
What the hell
was going on there?

50:02.432 --> 50:03.934
What is this?

50:03.934 --> 50:07.437
Little snacks for thought
for me to take home?

50:07.437 --> 50:10.941
I haven't pushed you enough
to confront these things.

50:10.941 --> 50:17.447
Somewhere along the line,
i became frightened of you.

50:17.948 --> 50:19.449
Frightened.

50:19.449 --> 50:25.455
Maybe i should've seen
that clearer in the beginning.

50:25.455 --> 50:30.460
Maybe, baby.

50:32.462 --> 50:33.964
Rage, anthony,

50:33.964 --> 50:37.968
is a big, loud, flaming,
self distraction

50:37.968 --> 50:40.470
from feelings that
are even more frightening.

50:40.971 --> 50:43.974
What feelings
might those be?

50:43.974 --> 50:44.975
Sadness.

50:45.475 --> 50:50.480
You go off on a racist rant
about indian food,

50:50.480 --> 50:55.986
your demented,
old bat of a mother.

50:55.986 --> 50:57.487
What else
has happened?

50:57.988 --> 51:01.992
Nothing.

51:01.992 --> 51:04.995
After two years treating you,
i've learned things.

51:04.995 --> 51:07.998
And i pick up sorrow
coming from you.

51:18.008 --> 51:20.510
I had a dream
i fucked your brains out,

51:20.510 --> 51:22.512
right on that desk.

51:22.512 --> 51:24.014
You loved it.

51:24.014 --> 51:26.516
You threw that at me
like a rock.

51:26.516 --> 51:30.020
Sadness, anthony,
stay with that.

51:30.020 --> 51:38.528
Mommy tried to kill you
and you gave her
airline tickets.

51:38.528 --> 51:39.529
Fuck you.

51:39.529 --> 51:41.031
And now you're
really in trouble.

51:41.031 --> 51:42.532
I'm gonna beat this shit,
you kidding me?

51:42.532 --> 51:45.535
With that...

51:52.542 --> 51:57.047
anthony...

52:06.556 --> 52:10.060
scott richard sipronowski.

52:22.072 --> 52:26.576
Meadow mariangela soprano.

52:35.585 --> 52:37.587
Jonathan tiffen.

52:44.094 --> 52:50.100
Anthony tomasello.

52:50.100 --> 52:52.102
It's fucking
graduation day.

52:52.602 --> 52:57.107
So i might as well
take this opportunity.

52:57.107 --> 53:01.611
I'm proposing you
to get your button.

53:01.611 --> 53:03.613
I fucking
deserve it.

53:04.114 --> 53:06.616
Got no spleen, gene.

53:06.616 --> 53:09.619
Congratulations.

53:09.619 --> 53:11.121
Thank you,
thank you.

53:11.121 --> 53:13.623
Yeah.

53:13.623 --> 53:19.129
Oh.

53:19.129 --> 53:21.631
What the fuck?

53:21.631 --> 53:24.134
That's right,
get an education.

53:24.134 --> 53:26.636
Excuse us.

53:26.636 --> 53:29.139
Carmella sees you,
she's gonna cut you
a new asshole.

53:29.639 --> 53:30.640
I'm leaving.

53:43.153 --> 53:45.655
It's great to see
your kid graduate, huh?

53:45.655 --> 53:48.158
The youth,
that's what's important.

53:48.158 --> 53:50.160
What we do
is small potatoes.

53:50.160 --> 53:53.163
And eric,
state college, right?

53:53.163 --> 53:54.664
He got accepte
d to georgetown.

53:55.165 --> 53:56.666
There's a little
money pinch.

53:56.666 --> 54:00.170
I heard you and charlene
split up.

54:00.670 --> 54:01.671
Christine.

54:01.671 --> 54:04.174
I'm getting
the fuck out of here,

54:04.674 --> 54:06.176
i got a job
on a ranch out west.

54:06.176 --> 54:08.178
What?

54:08.178 --> 54:10.180
Don't make me
fucking laugh.

54:10.180 --> 54:13.683
I lived in new mexico
until i was 11, remember?

54:14.184 --> 54:15.185
You ever try riding?

54:15.185 --> 54:17.187
Uh, no.

54:17.187 --> 54:19.689
The airlines are running
specials non- stop to nevada,

54:20.190 --> 54:23.193

half hours drive.

54:23.193 --> 54:25.695

New day.

54:27.197 --> 54:32.202

54:32.702 --> 54:34.704
Alright, david,
