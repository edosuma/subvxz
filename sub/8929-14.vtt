00:33.338 --> 00:35.238
( screeching )

00:36.972 --> 00:39.039
( buzzing )

00:43.706 --> 00:46.140
MEGATRON: Nucleate the thermal coils.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.074
SCORPONOK: Nucleating.

00:49.173 --> 00:51.640
Activate mutator beams.

00:51.741 --> 00:53.308
Activating.

00:56.441 --> 00:58.975
Boost particle ionator to triple capacity.

00:59.075 --> 01:00.142
Boosting.

01:01.776 --> 01:03.776
Increase chamber pressure.

01:03.876 --> 01:05.910
( grunts )

01:06.009 --> 01:08.477
The circuits. They're overloading.

01:08.577 --> 01:11.845
Let them. Activate the accelerator.

01:11.944 --> 01:13.911
Full force!

01:14.012 --> 01:16.811
( dramatic theme playing )

01:18.145 --> 01:20.612
( growls )

01:28.247 --> 01:31.481
MEGATRON: Oh. Success!

01:31.581 --> 01:33.415
Yes.

01:33.515 --> 01:38.415
I present to you a perfect clone of Dinobot.

01:39.949 --> 01:43.750
And all I needed was a speck of that traitor's DNA.

01:43.850 --> 01:46.150
Oh, very impressive.

01:46.250 --> 01:49.684
But what do we need him for?

01:49.784 --> 01:52.151
He'll provide us, shall we say,

01:52.251 --> 01:54.284
an unfair advantage,

01:54.385 --> 01:56.852
by infiltrating the Maximal base,

01:56.952 --> 01:59.786
and shutting down their defense grid.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.919
Of course, he can't transform,

02:02.019 --> 02:04.620
but I doubt it will be necessary.

02:04.719 --> 02:08.221
Are you certain this zombie bot can pull it off?

02:08.320 --> 02:11.087
Aah! Not only will I pull it off,

02:11.187 --> 02:14.788
I'll chew it up, and spit it out.

02:14.888 --> 02:16.955
Excellent.

02:17.055 --> 02:19.522
Now, it's Terrorsaur's job

02:19.622 --> 02:21.856
to eliminate the real Dinobot.

02:21.956 --> 02:26.757
Yes. Then I'll send in the clone.

02:26.857 --> 02:29.657
( suspenseful theme playing )

02:32.991 --> 02:35.158
( yawns )

02:35.258 --> 02:39.159
By The Inferno, I am bored.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.559
There's never a Predacon around when you need one.

02:44.359 --> 02:47.026
Hmm. At last.

02:47.127 --> 02:50.660
Now, to give our treacherous friend a little motivation.

02:50.761 --> 02:53.695
Terrorsaur, terrorize!

02:53.795 --> 02:56.495
( dramatic theme playing )

03:01.462 --> 03:03.196
( yawning )

03:08.430 --> 03:11.864
At last, an end to the boredom.

03:11.964 --> 03:14.698
Dinobot, maximize!

03:14.798 --> 03:17.065
( roars )

03:17.165 --> 03:18.766
( screeching )

03:21.799 --> 03:22.999
( laughs )

03:29.100 --> 03:30.834
Beast mode.

03:34.901 --> 03:36.635
( screeches )

03:38.301 --> 03:42.136
Coward! You won't escape me that easily!

03:42.236 --> 03:44.236
( roars )

03:44.336 --> 03:46.970
( growling )

03:47.070 --> 03:48.971
( dramatic theme playing )

03:53.638 --> 03:56.405
( screeches )

03:57.905 --> 03:59.972
( growls )

04:05.140 --> 04:06.440
( roars )

04:11.241 --> 04:14.641
DINOBOT: Where are you, my old comrade?

04:14.741 --> 04:19.275
Come out and we'll have a nice little chat.

04:22.109 --> 04:25.443
I have nothing to say. Except goodbye!

04:29.244 --> 04:30.977
( growling )

04:36.545 --> 04:38.245
( laughs )

04:42.046 --> 04:44.346
No!

04:46.280 --> 04:48.147
( laughs )

04:48.247 --> 04:51.714
Rust in peace, old comrade.

04:51.814 --> 04:53.248
Terrorsaur to Megatron.

04:53.348 --> 04:54.882
I've taken care of Dinobot.

04:54.981 --> 04:57.249
( over radio ): You may proceed with phase two.

04:57.349 --> 04:59.882
Acknowledged. Megatron out.

04:59.982 --> 05:03.183
It is time for you to do your worst. Go!

05:03.283 --> 05:07.884
As you command, mighty Megatron.

05:07.984 --> 05:11.418
( ominous theme playing )

05:17.818 --> 05:20.052
( suspenseful theme playing )

05:24.319 --> 05:25.787
( machinery whirring )

05:35.021 --> 05:38.522
Optimus, the Predacons.

05:38.622 --> 05:42.289
They're mounting a full-scale assault.

05:42.389 --> 05:44.289
From where?

05:46.623 --> 05:48.690
Grid Omega.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.891
Hm, there's nothing on the scanners.

05:50.991 --> 05:54.024
Rattrap, check the grids around Omega.

05:55.825 --> 05:58.725
Eh. Peaceful as an R chamber.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.893
Eh, looks like old chopper-face is seeing things.

06:01.993 --> 06:05.059
No! They're there, I tell you!

06:05.160 --> 06:08.393
Well, they could be using some kind of stealth device.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.994
Rhinox and Cheetor are close. I'll have them move in.

06:11.094 --> 06:13.060
You and Rattrap go back to where you saw them,

06:13.161 --> 06:14.428
and get a fix on their position.

06:14.528 --> 06:15.895
There's no time for that!

06:15.995 --> 06:18.629
If you don't stop them now,

06:18.729 --> 06:20.062
they'll overrun the base.

06:20.162 --> 06:23.463
You must lead a counterattack at once.

06:23.563 --> 06:25.396
Sentinel can handle them.

06:25.496 --> 06:28.130
And there's no reason to fight a battle we can avoid.

06:28.230 --> 06:29.330
Better get moving.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.031
But-- But--

06:32.130 --> 06:34.098
That's an order.

06:34.198 --> 06:35.731
( growls )

06:35.831 --> 06:38.732
Well, you coming?

06:38.832 --> 06:41.132
( sighs )

06:42.865 --> 06:44.800
( suspenseful theme playing )

06:56.868 --> 06:59.569
So, uh, where's these Predacons?

06:59.668 --> 07:03.136
It's as quiet as an oil bearing out here.

07:03.236 --> 07:04.936
Hmm.

07:05.036 --> 07:10.271
They should be right over that ridge.

07:10.371 --> 07:12.504
Well, then we better transform.

07:12.604 --> 07:14.704
Rattrap, maximize!

07:16.571 --> 07:19.105
( sighs )

07:19.205 --> 07:21.073
Uh, ahem.

07:21.173 --> 07:22.906
What are you waiting for, micro-brain?

07:23.006 --> 07:25.640
Settle into the metal.

07:25.740 --> 07:29.840
Hmm. Uh, Optimus said fix their position,

07:29.940 --> 07:31.674
not engage in battle.

07:31.774 --> 07:35.008
We can do that better in beast mode.

07:47.477 --> 07:49.076
RATTRAP: Oh, man.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.911
Talk about your inferno.

07:52.011 --> 07:54.911
Let's go quickly.

07:55.011 --> 07:58.345
Why don't you lead the way?

07:58.445 --> 08:01.212
( ominous theme playing )

08:04.846 --> 08:06.413
Huh? Hey!

08:06.513 --> 08:07.480
Hey, what are you doing?

08:07.580 --> 08:11.181
I should think it would be obvious.

08:11.281 --> 08:14.748
Even to a vermin like you.

08:17.015 --> 08:18.449
( screams )

08:23.383 --> 08:25.283
( screaming )

08:27.283 --> 08:28.416
( grunts )

08:28.516 --> 08:30.850
Ah. Oh, man.

08:30.950 --> 08:34.517
Oh, I just knew I smelled a rat.

08:34.617 --> 08:36.685
And it wasn't even me.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.518
Oh, just wait till I--

08:38.618 --> 08:40.186
( sniffs )

08:45.319 --> 08:47.320
No!

08:52.887 --> 08:55.655
Oh, man! Give me a break!

08:55.755 --> 08:56.822
( groans )

09:10.857 --> 09:12.890
( grunting )

09:14.758 --> 09:16.158
( growling )

09:16.258 --> 09:18.258
( dramatic theme playing )

09:18.358 --> 09:21.192
RHINOX ( over radio ): We've scoped Grid Omega.

09:21.292 --> 09:24.093
No sign of Preds or anything else.

09:24.193 --> 09:27.326
Odd. Rattrap and Dinobot should be there by now.

09:27.426 --> 09:29.494
Better have Cheetor check it out.

09:29.593 --> 09:31.127
( Dinobot clone groans )

09:31.227 --> 09:33.360
Dinobot!

09:33.461 --> 09:34.394
( groans )

09:34.494 --> 09:37.128
Optimus. What happened?

09:37.228 --> 09:40.296
We were-- We were ambushed.

09:40.395 --> 09:43.429
Megatron is using a stealth device,

09:43.529 --> 09:45.863
just as you suspected.

09:45.963 --> 09:47.163
Where's Rattrap?

09:47.263 --> 09:49.097
Trapped.

09:49.197 --> 09:52.031
You must leave at once, if you're to save him.

09:52.131 --> 09:55.097
Coordinates three-nine-six.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.299
I'll get you to the R chamber first.

10:02.399 --> 10:04.233
No! There's no time.

10:04.332 --> 10:06.732
I can make it.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.400
You go.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.733
I'm putting Sentinel on automatic.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.034
When you've repaired yourself,

10:13.134 --> 10:15.234
take over the scanners and comm links.

10:15.334 --> 10:18.001
DINOBOT CLONE: Of course.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.735
Good luck.

10:22.036 --> 10:24.002
Fool.

10:24.102 --> 10:26.269
( dramatic theme playing )

10:30.037 --> 10:33.103
COMPUTER: Perimeter shield online.

10:33.204 --> 10:35.405
Sentinel now active.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.271
( laughs )

10:37.371 --> 10:40.239
Ooh. Optimus will rue the day

10:40.338 --> 10:43.072
he left this clone alone.

10:43.172 --> 10:46.806
Now, what was it Megatron said to do?

10:48.906 --> 10:50.941
Oh, yes.

10:55.241 --> 10:57.441
COMPUTER: Please enter deactivation code.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.541
Deactivation code.

10:59.641 --> 11:03.742
Megatron said nothing about that.

11:03.843 --> 11:06.776
Well, I'm sure I can figure it out.

11:08.443 --> 11:11.211
There. That should do it.

11:11.311 --> 11:13.711
( screams )

11:13.811 --> 11:15.678
COMPUTER: Code incorrect.

11:15.778 --> 11:18.512
Scanning user.

11:18.612 --> 11:23.012
User identified as Dinobot, beast mode.

11:23.112 --> 11:26.246
Yes, yes, yes. I'm Dinobot.

11:26.346 --> 11:28.847
And I order you to deactivate.

11:28.947 --> 11:31.080
COMPUTER: Maximal energy signature not present.

11:31.180 --> 11:33.681
Please enter deactivation code.

Code incorrect.

11:38.148 --> 11:40.248

11:40.348 --> 11:42.516
( grunts )

11:42.615 --> 11:44.416
( sighs )

11:44.516 --> 11:47.883
Megatron said this would be easy.

11:50.150 --> 11:52.817
( suspenseful theme playing )

11:57.284 --> 11:58.985
( sniffing )

12:01.918 --> 12:04.086
Any sign of Rattrap or the Predacons?

12:04.186 --> 12:06.186
No Preds. But I picked up Rattrap's scent

12:06.286 --> 12:09.286
a few minutes ago. It ends here.

12:09.386 --> 12:11.553
You don't think he...?

12:11.653 --> 12:12.954
Let's hope not.

12:13.054 --> 12:14.454
Rattrap's a pain in the circuits,

12:14.554 --> 12:15.821
but I'd hate to lose him.

12:15.921 --> 12:18.188
We'd better keep searching.

12:20.988 --> 12:23.056
( screaming )

12:33.190 --> 12:34.824
( grunts )

12:36.325 --> 12:38.658
( screams )

12:44.159 --> 12:47.459
Oh, man, you gotta be kidding me.

12:49.594 --> 12:54.194
Rattrap, maximize!

12:54.294 --> 12:56.361
( grunting )

13:02.729 --> 13:04.829
Ah. Oh, boy.

13:04.929 --> 13:07.630
I was almost deep-fried rat.

13:11.563 --> 13:13.364
Well. Heh-heh.

13:13.464 --> 13:16.098
It's time to blow this joint.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.098
( explosive whining )

13:24.132 --> 13:26.199
( explosion in distance ) What was that?

13:28.067 --> 13:30.800
( Rattrap groans )

13:30.900 --> 13:32.701
You all right? ( grunts )

13:32.801 --> 13:35.201
Yeah. I will be.

13:35.301 --> 13:39.201
Soon as I get my hands on that stinkin' Dinobot.

13:39.301 --> 13:42.735
You know, that bolt-head tried to scrap me.

13:42.835 --> 13:46.202
But Dinobot's the one who told us you were trapped.

13:46.302 --> 13:48.669
Oh, yeah. Sure he did.

13:48.769 --> 13:50.670
To cover his own big butt.

13:50.770 --> 13:52.303
I tried to tell you,

13:52.403 --> 13:55.338
once a Pred, always a Pred.

13:55.438 --> 13:58.338
Now where is he?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.671
I left him back at the base.

14:00.771 --> 14:02.038
Alone.

14:02.138 --> 14:04.039
( dramatic theme playing )

14:04.138 --> 14:07.406
Well, that's just prime.

14:13.274 --> 14:14.274
( Dinobot snarls )

14:14.374 --> 14:17.641
Sentinel, stand down.

14:21.075 --> 14:23.542
COMPUTER: Perimeter shield deactivated.

14:23.642 --> 14:26.276
Ah! Yes, I've done it.

14:26.376 --> 14:29.177
( laughs )

14:29.276 --> 14:31.843
Clone 1 to Megatron.

14:31.943 --> 14:34.777
Megatron here. Report.

14:34.878 --> 14:37.011
DINOBOT CLONE: Phase three accomplished.

14:37.111 --> 14:39.445
Defense screen deactivated.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.678
And the Maximals?

14:41.778 --> 14:43.312
( laughs )

14:43.412 --> 14:46.980
Off on a wild vermin chase.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.046
The base is yours for the taking.

14:51.146 --> 14:54.214
MEGATRON: Excellent. Yes.

14:54.314 --> 14:56.881
I'll be there shortly. Megatron out.

15:02.682 --> 15:04.148
( both gasp )

15:05.682 --> 15:07.450
( both growling )

15:20.752 --> 15:22.352
Hmm.

15:24.685 --> 15:26.553
( roars )

15:28.486 --> 15:31.153
What in The Inferno are you?

15:31.254 --> 15:34.287
What you might have been,

15:34.387 --> 15:36.988
had you not betrayed Megatron.

15:37.088 --> 15:38.188
( roars )

15:38.288 --> 15:40.288
( grunts )

15:40.388 --> 15:42.655
( hisses )

15:43.989 --> 15:46.789
Dinobot, maximize!

15:46.890 --> 15:48.090
( dramatic theme playing )

15:48.190 --> 15:49.557
( roars )

15:52.023 --> 15:53.524
( growls )

15:56.957 --> 15:59.525
Oh, no.

16:03.726 --> 16:05.325
Well,

16:05.425 --> 16:07.493
what are you waiting for?

16:07.593 --> 16:11.793
Transform! So I can finish you with honor.

16:13.660 --> 16:17.327
I... I can't.

16:19.295 --> 16:23.295
Of course. You're nothing but a clone.

16:23.395 --> 16:28.830
Well, far be it from me to fight an inferior foe.

16:32.430 --> 16:34.330
( both grunt )

16:35.864 --> 16:40.665
Fortunately, I don't share your stupid sense of honor.

16:40.765 --> 16:42.632
( roars )

16:43.632 --> 16:45.900
( growling )

16:49.000 --> 16:50.433
( growling )

16:56.234 --> 16:57.201
Ha!

16:57.301 --> 16:59.968
( roars )

17:02.102 --> 17:04.469
( both growling )

17:10.203 --> 17:11.837
( grunts )

17:11.937 --> 17:13.770
( growls )

17:13.870 --> 17:16.037
( grunts )

17:16.137 --> 17:18.938
( growling )

17:20.738 --> 17:22.272
( groans )

17:24.172 --> 17:25.772
( laughs )

17:25.872 --> 17:30.606
Ooh. Megatron will reward me for this.

17:37.508 --> 17:40.942
Ah. Defenseless and completely unguarded.

17:41.042 --> 17:44.309
It almost seems too easy.

17:54.577 --> 17:58.945
Megatron, um, where are the others?

17:59.045 --> 18:02.745
Preparing an ambush for those Maximal fools.

18:02.845 --> 18:05.812
Then when they return here, I'll finish them

18:05.913 --> 18:07.679
with their own defense grid.

18:07.779 --> 18:13.147
Ooh. Your brilliance is an inspiration to me.

18:13.247 --> 18:16.247
Oh, you are a most enchanting creature.

18:16.347 --> 18:19.448
I may just clone the rest of my troops.

18:19.548 --> 18:22.949
And now, my leader,

18:23.049 --> 18:26.416
the prize is yours.

18:26.516 --> 18:28.783
( chuckles )

18:28.883 --> 18:31.816
( dramatic theme playing )

18:31.917 --> 18:35.417
Sentinel, activate perimeter shield.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.817
( shield powering up ) MEGATRON: Aah!

18:43.952 --> 18:46.252
( groaning )

18:47.853 --> 18:51.720
So. You ungrateful clone.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.254
You're as treacherous as the real Dinobot.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.521
Correction.

18:56.621 --> 18:59.621
I am the real Dinobot.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.888
( roars )

19:01.988 --> 19:05.522
So, you managed to best my clone after all.

19:05.622 --> 19:09.557
A pity. He was such a loyal fellow.

19:09.657 --> 19:11.957
Unlike you!

19:20.824 --> 19:22.492
( growling )

19:28.359 --> 19:31.160
Game's over, Megatron.

19:33.494 --> 19:35.661
Well, it appears my revenge must be postponed

19:35.761 --> 19:38.161
until next we meet.

19:40.862 --> 19:42.029
( gasps )

19:43.695 --> 19:45.796
( yelling )

19:48.963 --> 19:50.130
( groans )

19:55.264 --> 19:58.598
You and that clone sure trashed the place.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.965
Ah, don't tell me you're buying this clone stuff.

20:03.065 --> 20:05.232
You heard Megatron admit it.

20:05.332 --> 20:08.699
Oh, yeah. Like I'm gonna believe him.

20:08.799 --> 20:12.867
If there was a clone, then where is he, huh?

20:12.967 --> 20:16.401
I'm afraid he's gone for good.

20:16.501 --> 20:18.168
A shame really.

20:18.267 --> 20:21.168
He was such a handsome creature.

20:21.268 --> 20:24.468
And, uh, quite tasty.

20:27.136 --> 20:28.870
( burps )

20:28.970 --> 20:31.603
( playful theme playing )

20:35.938 --> 20:37.204
You're disgusting.

20:37.305 --> 20:39.204
( growls )

20:44.372 --> 20:46.239
