01:43.850 --> 01:46.150
Oh, very impressive.

01:46.250 --> 01:49.684
But what do we need him for?

01:49.784 --> 01:52.151
He'll provide us, shall we say,

01:52.251 --> 01:54.284
an unfair advantage,

01:54.385 --> 01:56.852
by infiltrating the Maximal base,

01:56.952 --> 01:59.786
and shutting down their defense grid.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.919
Of course, he can't transform,

02:02.019 --> 02:04.620
but I doubt it will be necessary.

02:04.719 --> 02:08.221
Are you certain this zombie bot can pull it off?

02:08.320 --> 02:11.087
Aah! Not only will I pull it off,

02:11.187 --> 02:14.788
I'll chew it up, and spit it out.

02:14.888 --> 02:16.955
Excellent.

02:17.055 --> 02:19.522
Now, it's Terrorsaur's job

02:19.622 --> 02:21.856

05:42.389 --> 05:44.289
From where?

05:46.623 --> 05:48.690
Grid Omega.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.891
Hm, there's nothing on the scanners.

05:50.991 --> 05:54.024
Rattrap, check the grids around Omega.

05:55.825 --> 05:58.725
Eh. Peaceful as an R chamber.

05:58.825 --> 06:01.893
Eh, looks like old chopper-face is seeing things.

06:01.993 --> 06:05.059
No! They're there, I tell you!

06:05.160 --> 06:08.393
Well, they could be using some kind of stealth device.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.994
Rhinox and Cheetor are close. I'll have them move in.

06:11.094 --> 06:13.060
You and Rattrap go back to where you saw them,

06:13.161 --> 06:14.428
and get a fix on their position.

06:14.528 --> 06:15.895
There's no time for that!

06:15.995 --> 06:18.629
If you don't stop them now,

06:18.729 --> 06:20.062
they'll overrun the base.

06:20.162 --> 06:23.463
You must lead a counterattack at once.

06:23.563 --> 06:25.396
Sentinel can handle them.

06:25.496 --> 06:28.130
And there's no reason to fight a battle we can avoid.

06:28.230 --> 06:29.330
Better get moving.

06:29.431 --> 06:32.031
But-- But--

That's an order.

( suspenseful theme playing )

06:56.868 --> 06:59.569
So, uh, where's these Predacons?

06:59.668 --> 07:03.136
It's as quiet as an oil bearing out here.

07:03.236 --> 07:04.936
Hmm.

07:05.036 --> 07:10.271
They should be right over that ridge.

07:10.371 --> 07:12.504
Well, then we better transform.

07:12.604 --> 07:14.704
Rattrap, maximize!

07:16.571 --> 07:19.105

07:19.205 --> 07:21.073
Uh, ahem.

What are you waiting for, micro-brain?

07:23.006 --> 07:25.640
Settle into the metal.

07:25.740 --> 07:29.840
Hmm. Uh, Optimus said fix their position,

07:29.940 --> 07:31.674
not engage in battle.

07:31.774 --> 07:35.008
We can do that better in beast mode.

08:04.846 --> 08:06.413
Huh? Hey!

08:06.513 --> 08:07.480
Hey, what are you doing?

08:07.580 --> 08:11.181
I should think it would be obvious.

08:11.281 --> 08:14.748

We were-- We were ambushed.

09:40.395 --> 09:43.429
Megatron is using a stealth device,

09:43.529 --> 09:45.863
just as you suspected.

09:45.963 --> 09:47.163
Where's Rattrap?

09:47.263 --> 09:49.097
Trapped.

09:49.197 --> 09:52.031
You must leave at once, if you're to save him.

09:52.131 --> 09:55.097
Coordinates three-nine-six.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.299
I'll get you to the R chamber first.

10:02.399 --> 10:04.233
No! There's no time.

10:04.332 --> 10:06.732
I can make it.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.400
You go.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.733
I'm putting Sentinel on automatic.

10:11.834 --> 10:13.034
When you've repaired yourself,

10:13.134 --> 10:15.234
take over the scanners and comm links.

No Preds. But I picked up Rattrap's scent

12:06.286 --> 12:09.286
a few minutes ago. It ends here.

12:09.386 --> 12:11.553
You don't think he...?

12:11.653 --> 12:12.954
Let's hope not.

12:13.054 --> 12:14.454
Rattrap's a pain in the circuits,

12:14.554 --> 12:15.821
but I'd hate to lose him.

12:15.921 --> 12:18.188
We'd better keep searching.

( grunting )

13:02.729 --> 13:04.829
Ah. Oh, boy.

13:04.929 --> 13:07.630
I was almost deep-fried rat.

13:11.563 --> 13:13.364
Well. Heh-heh.

13:13.464 --> 13:16.098
It's time to blow this joint.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.098
( explosive whining )

13:24.132 --> 13:26.199

13:28.067 --> 13:30.800
( Rattrap groans )

13:30.900 --> 13:32.701
You all right? ( grunts )

13:32.801 --> 13:35.201
Yeah. I will be.

13:35.301 --> 13:39.201
Soon as I get my hands on that stinkin' Dinobot.

13:39.301 --> 13:42.735
You know, that bolt-head tried to scrap me.

13:42.835 --> 13:46.202
But Dinobot's the one who told us you were trapped.

13:46.302 --> 13:48.669
Oh, yeah. Sure he did.

13:48.769 --> 13:50.670
To cover his own big butt.

13:50.770 --> 13:52.303
I tried to tell you,

13:52.403 --> 13:55.338
once a Pred, always a Pred.

13:55.438 --> 13:58.338
Now where is he?

13:58.438 --> 14:00.671
I left him back at the base.

14:00.771 --> 14:02.038
Alone.

14:02.138 --> 14:04.039
( dramatic theme playing )

14:04.138 --> 14:07.406
Well, that's just prime.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.525
Oh, no.

16:03.726 --> 16:05.325
Well,

16:05.425 --> 16:07.493
what are you waiting for?

16:07.593 --> 16:11.793
Transform! So I can finish you with honor.

16:13.660 --> 16:17.327
I... I can't.

16:19.295 --> 16:23.295
Of course. You're nothing but a clone.

16:23.395 --> 16:28.830
Well, far be it from me to fight an inferior foe.

16:32.430 --> 16:34.330
( both grunt )

16:35.864 --> 16:40.665
Fortunately, I don't share your stupid sense of honor.

16:40.765 --> 16:42.632

17:24.172 --> 17:25.772
( laughs )

17:25.872 --> 17:30.606
Ooh. Megatron will reward me for this.

17:37.508 --> 17:40.942
Ah. Defenseless and completely unguarded.

17:41.042 --> 17:44.309
It almost seems too easy.

17:54.577 --> 17:58.945
Megatron, um, where are the others?

17:59.045 --> 18:02.745
Preparing an ambush for those Maximal fools.

18:02.845 --> 18:05.812
Then when they return here, I'll finish them

18:05.913 --> 18:07.679
with their own defense grid.

18:07.779 --> 18:13.147
Ooh. Your brilliance is an inspiration to me.

18:13.247 --> 18:16.247
Oh, you are a most enchanting creature.

18:16.347 --> 18:19.448
I may just clone the rest of my troops.

18:19.548 --> 18:22.949
And now, my leader,

18:23.049 --> 18:26.416
the prize is yours.

18:26.516 --> 18:28.783

18:43.952 --> 18:46.252
( groaning )

18:47.853 --> 18:51.720
So. You ungrateful clone.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.254
You're as treacherous as the real Dinobot.

18:54.353 --> 18:56.521
Correction.

18:56.621 --> 18:59.621
I am the real Dinobot.

18:59.721 --> 19:01.888
( roars )

19:01.988 --> 19:05.522
So, you managed to best my clone after all.

19:05.622 --> 19:09.557
A pity. He was such a loyal fellow.

19:09.657 --> 19:11.957
Unlike you!

19:20.824 --> 19:22.492
( growling )

19:28.359 --> 19:31.160
Game's over, Megatron.

19:33.494 --> 19:35.661
Well, it appears my revenge must be postponed

19:35.761 --> 19:38.161
until next we meet.

19:40.862 --> 19:42.029
( gasps )

19:43.695 --> 19:45.796
( yelling )

19:48.963 --> 19:50.130
( groans )

19:55.264 --> 19:58.598
You and that clone sure trashed the place.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.965
Ah, don't tell me you're buying this clone stuff.

20:03.065 --> 20:05.232
You heard Megatron admit it.

20:05.332 --> 20:08.699
Oh, yeah. Like I'm gonna believe him.

20:08.799 --> 20:12.867
If there was a clone, then where is he, huh?

20:12.967 --> 20:16.401
I'm afraid he's gone for good.

20:16.501 --> 20:18.168
A shame really.

20:18.267 --> 20:21.168
He was such a handsome creature.

20:21.268 --> 20:24.468
And, uh, quite tasty.
