04:39.579 --> 04:40.412
<i> Cal.</i>

04:40.414 --> 04:44.916
You remember that
rancher guy you had
working for you, back when?

04:47.854 --> 04:49.421
That's him.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.890
Look, I gotta get in touch
with his brother.

04:51.892 --> 04:56.361
He was some kind of
a dinosaur hunter, right?

04:58.431 --> 05:00.732
Him and his wife?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.937
Brothers said that.

05:10.943 --> 05:12.978
Now, about the wife...

05:25.758 --> 05:27.659
Hey, John.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.094
You in there?

05:29.096 --> 05:34.333
Come on, Dr. Olson.
Got something
we gotta discuss.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.837
Not Olson anymore, Terry.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.006
All right, doc.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.574
Old habits.

05:42.576 --> 05:47.079
So, you wanting something
or you just come by
to shitheel me?

05:47.081 --> 05:48.680
The oil company's
moving in.

05:48.682 --> 05:53.552
All right.
Signed off on the land,
yesterday, so...

05:55.888 --> 05:56.688
You flirt.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.757
The bakken don't
extend this far south.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.726
Hey, hold off, now, doll.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.662
As long as
you've been out here,

06:03.664 --> 06:08.533
how much have we seen
from all your fossil hunting?

06:10.036 --> 06:10.936
All right, well,

06:10.938 --> 06:13.905
think it's time
for you to move on.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.977
You're right.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.534
Hey.

07:18.438 --> 07:22.107
You want me to make you
something to eat?

07:24.577 --> 07:27.212
Want to know
how the dig went?

07:30.851 --> 07:35.153
It was a total disaster.
Thanks for asking.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.139
Can I come in?

07:59.245 --> 08:01.179
So, whatcha working on?

08:02.048 --> 08:03.515
Aquarius?

08:03.517 --> 08:06.017
Yeah, the spacing's good.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.720
You gonna make a wish on one?

08:09.055 --> 08:11.857
That's stuff for kids.

08:20.066 --> 08:23.869
Granddad didn't get you
too far in this book, huh?

08:24.170 --> 08:27.038
Hmm. He tried.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.143
Hey, Ezekiel.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.078
Wanna see something?

08:34.081 --> 08:36.280
What is it?

08:37.015 --> 08:40.818
Check it out.
Another one of
your dinosaur things?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.787
Yeah. Yeah, kind of.

08:42.789 --> 08:43.788
It's from the dig.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.025
I was hoping to find...
I got homework.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.528
Okay.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.097
Do you wanna at least know
what species they are?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.698
Mom...
I'm not gonna know for sure

08:53.700 --> 08:55.667
until I extract
the entire embryo.
That's cool, mom,

08:55.669 --> 08:57.769
but I really have
homework, okay?
I have a strong theory

08:57.771 --> 08:59.704
they are triceratops cubs.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.605
Isn't that cool?

09:00.607 --> 09:02.307
You wanna hold
a triceratops cub?
Maybe later.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.809
Ezekiel. Come on, this is
your chance
to hold a piece of...

09:04.811 --> 09:07.679
Mom! I don't want to
hold your stupid thing.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.047
Ezekiel!
What's happening?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.582
What the hell
did you just do?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.617
When did you get home?
It's the best
goddamn piece

09:12.619 --> 09:13.818
- I found today.
- Hey...

09:13.820 --> 09:15.820
I wasn't interested.
I said no!

09:25.831 --> 09:27.632
What, uh...

09:29.268 --> 09:31.970
Well, welcome home, Anna.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.839
I'll put the little
bruiser to bed.

10:22.188 --> 10:25.123
I guess that didn't
go so well, huh?

10:26.859 --> 10:27.726
Well, dad,

10:27.728 --> 10:30.729
you're the one who's always
telling me I oughta try
and get closer to the boy.

10:30.731 --> 10:34.132
Well, yeah, by asking
eze what sort of
things he likes.

10:34.134 --> 10:38.169
Not by forcing on him
the stuff that you do.

10:38.738 --> 10:41.840
I have no idea what he likes.

10:42.074 --> 10:44.909
I think that's
what I mean.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.884
Look... it's getting
a little late.

10:53.386 --> 10:57.322
Why don't you go
tuck your son in

10:57.324 --> 11:00.692
and I'll finish up.
Okay.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.062
You know, a nice thing
about the past,

11:04.064 --> 11:07.899
it will still be there
when you wake up.

11:08.234 --> 11:10.335
Yup.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.772
Worst thing, too.

11:28.054 --> 11:30.288
Hey, Ezekiel.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.023
I'm...

11:33.926 --> 11:36.928
I know it was
an accident, okay?

11:43.002 --> 11:44.736
Hey.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.472
Let's get to bed, okay?

11:56.849 --> 11:58.416
Is that...

11:58.418 --> 12:00.852
It's my watch.

12:01.921 --> 12:05.990
Well, it's broken.
Don't you want
another one?

12:06.058 --> 12:07.492
It's dad's.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.894
Yes, I know it was.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.499
Where did you get that?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.970
Hey.

12:20.272 --> 12:21.906
We're not open.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.942
Nate, it's me.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.248
We're not open.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.085
You got my voice mail.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.755
What?
You get my voice mail?

12:36.757 --> 12:37.522
No, I... look.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.991
I don't want you
hanging out with...

12:39.993 --> 12:43.061
I don't want you
giving stuff to my kid.

12:43.329 --> 12:46.798
The watch? Jesus Christ!

12:47.800 --> 12:48.933
This couldn't wait a bit.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.802
That could have waited
till tomorrow morning, huh?

12:50.804 --> 12:55.006
No, Nate. Because i
distinctly remember already
having this conversation.

12:55.008 --> 12:59.444
I don't want you hanging out
with Ezekiel
when I'm out of town.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.314
When you're out of town.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.816
I'm the boy's uncle.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.518
Someone oughta be
spending time with him

13:06.520 --> 13:08.419
when you're out
for months on end,

13:08.421 --> 13:10.421
digging around in
boneshit nowhere.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.857
Mmm-hmm. Okay, great.
Thank you very much.

13:12.859 --> 13:17.128
Nate, I realize Ezekiel's
the only family you got left,

13:17.130 --> 13:18.329
but I don't need parent...

13:18.331 --> 13:21.132
I don't need
parenting advice from you.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.102
Okay, so,
you called me, twice.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.371
I'm here.
What the hell
did you want?

13:26.373 --> 13:28.940
Well, if you
had listened to
my voice mail,

13:28.942 --> 13:30.575
we could have done it
over the phone.
Jesus.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.011
You wouldn't have
to bother
coming down here.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.347
But since you're here,
have a beer.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.518
Thanks.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.225
This that ranch
you used to work on?

13:47.227 --> 13:50.562
Napping around on?
Uh-huh.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.832
Okay, and?

13:54.300 --> 13:55.867
Well,

13:55.869 --> 13:59.871
I told you all about it
in the voice mail.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.574
We could go over it
again if you'd like.

14:04.177 --> 14:08.479
<i> Hey, you. It's me.</i>

14:08.547 --> 14:10.548
You got me on your phone
as "son of a bitch"?

14:10.550 --> 14:13.284
Would you be quiet?
I'm trying to listen to you.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.086
<i> Well, you're not</i>
<i> answering, obviously,</i>

14:15.088 --> 14:17.422
<i> which means you're probably</i>
<i> still, I don't know, mad,</i>

14:17.424 --> 14:23.061
<i> but my old boss</i>
<i> got a call from</i>
<i> one of them oil rig guys,</i>

14:23.063 --> 14:23.995
<i> Wes McCoy.</i>

14:23.997 --> 14:26.631
<i> Thinks he might have</i>
<i> stumbled on something.</i>

14:26.633 --> 14:29.400
<i> He found a tooth.</i>

14:29.402 --> 14:30.602
<i> Big one...</i>

14:30.604 --> 14:32.270
You hung up on me.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.137
A tooth, Nate?

14:33.139 --> 14:35.306
You've got to be kidding me.
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.075
No. Because a therapod
tooth means shit.

14:37.077 --> 14:41.479
If it's even what they
think it is, carnivores shed
them suckers like mad.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.648
It's probably nothing.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.284
Yeah, well, it
could be something.

14:46.585 --> 14:50.221
Great. Yeah,
it's great science
there, genius.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.225
You know,

14:54.227 --> 14:56.294
for somebody
who doesn't like
bringing up Ethan,

14:56.296 --> 14:59.464
you sure sound
a heck of a lot like him.

14:59.531 --> 15:03.668
Yeah, maybe
I'm no scientific genius.

15:03.670 --> 15:09.207
If I was, I wouldn't
have to bring
you in on this deal.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.976
Jesus, Nate, what
do you want from me?

15:11.978 --> 15:16.180
I'm just suppose to
drop everything
and rush up there?

15:17.416 --> 15:21.052
Dude, you got
nothing to drop.

15:21.353 --> 15:23.988
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

15:23.990 --> 15:27.959
Go up there,
you don't find anything.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.428
I'm still a son of a bitch.

15:35.669 --> 15:38.169
What the hell.
God damn it, Nate.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.438
Is that a yeah?
Yeah.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.507
You're coming with me, though.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.541
Sure.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.177
Somebody's gotta
introduce you
to the ranch owner.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.246
No. Because
when it turns out
to be nothing,

15:48.248 --> 15:52.517
I'm gonna need someone
within swatting distance.

15:58.190 --> 16:01.159
I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning, then.

16:03.996 --> 16:05.463
Tomorrow.

16:24.183 --> 16:27.051
Well, come on.
This is ridiculous.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.720
You just got back.
Dad.

16:28.722 --> 16:33.057
Dad, it's probably
just for the weekend.
Three days, tops.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.192
Well, maybe that's good, then.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.160
'Cause this way,
you'll be back
on Monday, right?

16:36.162 --> 16:38.029
Please, dad.
I know what
you're gonna say.

16:38.031 --> 16:40.164
That he should come with...
Yeah, that he
should come with...

16:40.166 --> 16:42.033
Of course
I'm gonna say that.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.701
Why the hell not?

16:43.703 --> 16:46.070
You know exactly
why the hell not, dad.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.206
Because it's the badlands,
not a playground.

16:48.208 --> 16:52.777
Jesus. There's wild animals,
crap weather.
The list goes on.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.145
This ain't funny, Anna.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.314
You're telling me.
It's a long list.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.383
Anna!
Hey.

16:58.450 --> 17:00.151
Susanna!

17:00.486 --> 17:03.021
Hey.
Morning, bill.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.522
What do you want from me, dad?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.059
It ain't what I want.

17:09.494 --> 17:14.531
Now, I went to the trouble
of packing him a little bag.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.534
What about school?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.637
I went to the trouble
of notifying his principal.

17:19.638 --> 17:23.340
Well, you went to quite
a lot of trouble, seems like.

17:23.675 --> 17:24.608
Listen, kiddo,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.412
you're gonna have
to deal
with this sometime.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.714
You can't go running off
with your rocks and bones,

17:29.716 --> 17:33.317
and pretend that
you're raising a son.

17:33.752 --> 17:37.321
Guilt ain't the
same as protection.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.700
<i> Right. But that</i>
<i> doesn't have anything</i>
<i> to do with the cartel.</i>

17:49.702 --> 17:51.436
<i> It doesn't</i>
<i> have anything to do...</i>

17:51.438 --> 17:53.137
<i> It has everything</i>
<i> to do with the cartel.</i>

17:53.139 --> 17:54.639
<i> The boom brought</i>
<i> overpopulation.</i>

17:54.641 --> 17:57.175
<i> They brought the</i>
<i> trade of crystal meth</i>
<i> to an all-time high,</i>

17:57.177 --> 17:59.544
<i> and now, you got</i>
<i> these Mexican cartels.</i>

17:59.546 --> 18:02.346
<i> They're up here</i>
<i> and they're trading guns.</i>

18:02.348 --> 18:03.281
<i> Or drugs.</i>

18:03.283 --> 18:05.783
<i> Right, but the cartel</i>
<i> has been here</i>
<i> since the '90s, at least,</i>

18:05.785 --> 18:08.419
<i> just didn't hear</i>
<i> about it regularly.</i>
<i> You hear about it now.</i>

18:08.421 --> 18:10.855
<i> Do you realize</i>
<i> that we have gangs</i>
<i> competing for territory</i>

18:10.857 --> 18:12.190
<i> all across the state?</i>

18:12.192 --> 18:13.825
<i> And I'm not just</i>
<i> talking about williston.</i>

18:13.827 --> 18:15.660
<i>- I'm talking about...</i>
<i>- I'm just saying...</i>

18:15.662 --> 18:18.129
<i> I'm talking</i>
<i>as far east as Fargo.</i>
<i> You had 'em, right?</i>

18:18.131 --> 18:20.298
<i> If you wanna take</i>
<i> the power away</i>
<i> from the cartel,</i>

18:20.300 --> 18:23.801
<i> you have to take away</i>
<i> their market.</i>
<i> It's just, I mean...</i>

19:14.753 --> 19:16.154
Jump. Look out.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.221
Crap.
Hey.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.289
Easy on the language.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.691
Billy can say it,
and he's only seven.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.894
Oh, yeah? Let me get a game.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.762
Show you how the pros do it.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.634
Crap.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.820
Anything else for you two?

19:49.822 --> 19:51.756
Just keep 'em coming.

19:52.791 --> 19:54.625
Hi, hon.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.463
So, McCoy.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.867
Word down the line is,
you think you found
yourself something

20:02.869 --> 20:03.901
out in the badlands.

20:03.903 --> 20:09.307
I know I got something
down there, so,
hon, the question is,

20:09.608 --> 20:12.276
what's it worth to you?

20:34.366 --> 20:35.466
So?

20:35.468 --> 20:39.604
Carnivore species were
known to shed their teeth
all over the goddamn place,

20:39.606 --> 20:41.005
but this still has
its root intact.

20:41.007 --> 20:45.476
That means the incisor
was still attached to
the dinosaur when it died.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.279
You're saying
there's maybe more.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.583
There may be a lot more.

20:53.352 --> 20:54.785
See?

20:54.787 --> 20:56.787
What did I tell you?

20:56.789 --> 20:59.257
She's out there.

20:59.725 --> 21:02.260
How do you know it's a she?

21:04.763 --> 21:05.930
I don't know.

21:05.932 --> 21:09.634
I've just been
calling it a she,
like a...

21:10.636 --> 21:12.770
Well, like a captain.

21:12.772 --> 21:16.307
White whale kind of shit.
You know what I mean?

21:16.309 --> 21:19.610
Okay, well, you're not wrong.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.013
This here?

21:22.015 --> 21:22.913
T-Rex tooth.

21:22.915 --> 21:27.952
It's a fairly large specimen,
too, which among
tyrannosaur breeds means,

21:27.954 --> 21:30.021
yeah, it's probably female.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.889
Cool.

21:32.491 --> 21:33.658
A t-fucking-Rex?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.828
I'll be damned.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.564
Hey. Dead man.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.800
You're supposed to be gone.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.069
But here he is.

21:46.872 --> 21:47.872
Here I am.

21:47.874 --> 21:51.909
I'm kind of in the
middle of something
here, slick, all right?

21:53.913 --> 21:54.912
Yeah, I see that.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.748
I didn't mean to
intrude on your date.

21:58.784 --> 22:01.419
But we've seen you now.

22:03.922 --> 22:04.889
Let's go, Reese.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.958
Next time,
they ought to bury you deeper.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.929
So, good. Great, roots,
teeth, all that.
That's fucking awesome.

22:11.931 --> 22:15.833
That something
i ought to be
concerned about?

22:16.401 --> 22:18.336
I've never seem 'em
before in my life.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.870
Just a couple of
dumb drunks...

22:19.872 --> 22:20.905
'Cause I don't know you.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.707
I don't know
what the hell this is.

22:22.709 --> 22:26.010
But I do not need
that shit on my dig.

23:07.986 --> 23:10.921
It's Ace. Okay.

23:10.923 --> 23:15.559
He's all right.
You're all right. See?

23:15.761 --> 23:17.395
See?

23:17.696 --> 23:19.397
Friends.

23:19.765 --> 23:21.165
Buddies.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.933
Right?

23:23.468 --> 23:24.969
Yeah.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.407
You've seen me.

23:45.624 --> 23:48.826
Well, well. Nate Olson,
as I live and shit.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.996
Kimberly.
You meet with McCoy?

23:52.798 --> 23:54.532
She did.

23:55.567 --> 23:58.569
Mrs. jordall.
Hi, it's a pleasure.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.137
Kimberly, please.

24:00.539 --> 24:02.606
"Mrs." is for
spinsters and suits.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.743
We got dirt under our nails,
don't we, doctor?

24:05.745 --> 24:06.744
Anna, here, she...

24:06.746 --> 24:08.879
You don't have
to give me a big spiel, Nate.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.648
I know who she is.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.049
You're the
paleontologist, yes?

24:12.051 --> 24:17.188
The one that was thrown
into prison for digging up
bones on government land.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.493
Actually, I didn't know
it was blm land at the time.

24:22.495 --> 24:24.829
I'm sure
there's a pretty story.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.096
There always is.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.499
Look, I know how this works.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.868
Someone like you comes
and digs up the bones,

24:30.870 --> 24:32.636
and we're supposed
to arrange for a broker

24:32.638 --> 24:37.541
to find a buyer in Dubai
who wants to be the
only guy on his block

24:37.543 --> 24:38.976
with a dinosaur
in his living room.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.847
What I want to know is,
why should I let an ex-convict

24:42.849 --> 24:44.915
monkey around on my land?

24:48.119 --> 24:49.887
I need this.

24:50.755 --> 24:56.627
If that Rex is down there,
she's been trapped
for 67 million years.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.698
I think she deserves
a new life.

25:04.569 --> 25:07.738
Well, I certainly
hope she gets one.

25:11.076 --> 25:14.078
I look forward to
meeting our dinosaur.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.616
Thank you.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.166
Not her.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.039
I can still...

29:15.320 --> 29:16.053
What?

29:16.055 --> 29:19.123
<i> Don't "what." The book.</i>
<i>The book is "what."</i>

29:19.924 --> 29:20.891
Why did you pack it?

29:20.893 --> 29:24.228
<i> Well,</i>
<i> it's just a little something</i>
<i> I got for eze when you...</i>

29:24.230 --> 29:26.196
I know what it is.

29:26.264 --> 29:30.367
I don't know why i
packed it exactly.

29:30.502 --> 29:34.304
I just thought maybe,

29:34.306 --> 29:35.272
I don't know...

29:35.274 --> 29:38.876
Might be
a little middle ground
for you two.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.483
So, you staying?

29:47.018 --> 29:50.554
It's a little premature before
I've seen the bone bed.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.256
But looks promising.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.992
<i> Oh, honey, that's great.</i>

29:55.093 --> 29:57.427
<i> I'm really happy for you.</i>

29:57.429 --> 30:02.533
<i> So, do you think</i>
<i> eze's gonna be</i>
<i> staying with you?</i>

30:02.867 --> 30:06.003
If it turns out, uh,

30:07.105 --> 30:09.106
I'll think about it.

30:09.207 --> 30:13.210
Just don't know
if he'd want to.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.480
You two just need some time.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.149
He's young.

30:19.217 --> 30:23.520
He just seems older,
that's all.

30:26.124 --> 30:27.825
Yeah.

30:28.059 --> 30:30.227
He always does.

30:32.263 --> 30:35.532
Yeah.
That's the way it happens.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.837
They grow up.

30:44.309 --> 30:46.376
You have a good night.

30:46.378 --> 30:49.313
Give that boy
a big squeeze from me.

30:49.514 --> 30:52.316
<i> Good night, dad.</i>
Bye-bye.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.579
Hey, what's up?

31:27.151 --> 31:32.389
I just got off the phone
with the shift manager
over at Scofield.

31:32.391 --> 31:34.958
He said one of his
drillers didn't show.

31:36.527 --> 31:37.461
Fucking Scofield.

31:37.463 --> 31:42.566
So, I'm going to
need you to fill
one of these for me.

31:44.535 --> 31:48.305
The boom's slowing up.
The company's cracking down.

31:48.307 --> 31:49.306
It ain't personal.

31:49.308 --> 31:53.176
Hell, they're
testing everybody,
even folks who got no

31:53.178 --> 31:55.245
history of abuse.

31:57.515 --> 31:58.382
Of course,

31:58.384 --> 32:02.552
I could always say
you never
showed this morning.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.990
Yeah.

33:35.413 --> 33:37.447
You like that one, huh?

33:39.650 --> 33:41.318
You...

33:41.320 --> 33:43.320
You like horses?

33:44.055 --> 33:46.523
Yeah. They're okay.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.261
When you feed 'em,
make sure you
hold your hand flat

33:51.263 --> 33:53.130
so you don't get bit.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.564
I'll be out of your hair
in a couple of days,

33:54.566 --> 33:57.367
then you don't have
to worry about anything.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.236
No, I was just...

34:00.538 --> 34:02.506
Be careful, that's all.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.207
Mmm-hmm.

34:04.209 --> 34:09.746
Did you and dad
use to ride horses
when you were working?

34:14.452 --> 34:16.353
Sometimes, yeah.

34:17.522 --> 34:19.489
Yeah, when we could.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.192
Cool.

35:32.196 --> 35:35.165
What's that
you're playing?

35:35.867 --> 35:39.269
I'm not sure
you could call it
playing just yet.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.737
That's a lot
better than I can do.

35:40.739 --> 35:44.574
Couldn't find my
sorry way around
a kazoo, let alone

35:44.576 --> 35:47.777
that monster.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.414
I got a little girl back home.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.884
A bit younger than your boy.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.852
Emily.

35:55.854 --> 36:00.524
Get to call her,
or whatever,
now and again,

36:00.526 --> 36:03.493
when I can sneak
it past her mom.

36:04.362 --> 36:05.662
So, you know,

36:05.664 --> 36:08.798
just thought I'd learn
a little ditty she liked.

36:08.866 --> 36:10.567
A lullaby.

36:11.702 --> 36:12.802
That's nice.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.704
Nah, it's stupid.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.706
Hey!

36:17.608 --> 36:19.476
What gives?

36:19.544 --> 36:21.244
We're burning daylight.

36:21.246 --> 36:23.713
Get a move on.
It's up ahead.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.562
No, she won't.

36:41.666 --> 36:44.868
So, you really think you can
have her out inside a month.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.336
Well, we'll have to.

36:46.338 --> 36:49.539
It's late in the year
for a dig of this size.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.208
Over there, please.

36:51.210 --> 36:51.975
It's not unheard of.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.677
We'll have to have her out
before winter, though,

36:53.679 --> 36:55.745
or, we're looking
at having to break
till next season.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.347
This your shit?
Thanks, slick.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.748
That is mighty
impressive, doctor.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.985
Don't get too excited.
It's going to
take us a minimum of two years

37:01.987 --> 37:05.722
in a lab before
she's ready for auction.

37:05.790 --> 37:09.359
All right,
well, I'll have my man
draw up the papers.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.361
Last thing, shares.

37:11.363 --> 37:15.232
We split our 70.
You keep your 30
all to your lonesome.

37:15.234 --> 37:15.765
I see.

37:15.767 --> 37:19.502
Sacks of money from Dubai
are always an option, Kim.

37:19.604 --> 37:20.403
Like hell.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.974
Let Dubai dig up
its own tyrannosaur.
This gal's American.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.511
Hey, stranger.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.447
You gonna join civilization?

37:30.449 --> 37:33.483
I'm good
right here. Thanks.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.494
This okay?

37:44.496 --> 37:47.764
Let's see.
What have we got here?

37:48.633 --> 37:50.867
We got some from our gal.

37:50.968 --> 37:52.502
And... oh.

37:52.504 --> 37:56.706
Some fragments
of edmontosaurus annectens.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.908
I'm in second grade.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.645
Sorry. Duckbill.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.647
T-Rex breakfast.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.715
Nice find.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.889
Do you think dad
would have been proud of me?

38:14.525 --> 38:18.361
Anna, I need your
eye over here, please.

38:18.796 --> 38:21.965
Whatcha doing there, eze?
Find something?

38:40.418 --> 38:43.386
Susanna, have a beer.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.388
Relax.
Thank you.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.991
This is going great.
Look at this.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.545
Hey, guys.

39:08.779 --> 39:10.747
Come look at this.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.370
Goddamn, look at that skull.

39:33.938 --> 39:35.672
Jackpot.

39:49.420 --> 39:50.587
What are you doing up here?

39:50.589 --> 39:54.424
I get one bar up here.
I thought I'd
check the weather.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.859
What are you doing?

39:55.861 --> 39:57.827
Checking the weather.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.066
What do you think?

40:03.634 --> 40:06.035
Those clouds
sure look mean.

40:07.471 --> 40:09.072
I don't know.

40:09.140 --> 40:11.074
Remember
a couple of years ago.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.410
We had that big storm.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.844
Yeah.

40:16.113 --> 40:17.947
Yeah, I remember.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.743
You were
talking in your sleep.

41:25.583 --> 41:28.618
Yeah. I had a bad dream.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.554
About dad?

41:31.622 --> 41:33.156
What?

41:34.091 --> 41:35.758
No.

41:36.827 --> 41:37.594
No.

41:37.596 --> 41:40.897
It's okay.
You can talk
about him around me.

41:40.899 --> 41:43.566
Me... me and uncle Nate do.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.869
Talk about him.

41:52.710 --> 41:54.277
Hey.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.179
Come here.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.833
I'm telling you,
she's cheatin'.

42:16.835 --> 42:20.036
You just got
a shit poker face,
that's all.

42:20.237 --> 42:23.106
Would a guy with
a shit poker face

42:23.108 --> 42:24.207
throw that?
Yes.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.309
That's actually exactly
what he would do.

42:26.311 --> 42:30.747
Needless to say,
i called your bluff.
Did you see how I did that?

42:30.749 --> 42:34.884
Well, we're laying 'em down
there, buddy. What you got?

42:37.288 --> 42:38.254
Look at these.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.124
King pokerface over here.

42:41.592 --> 42:44.561
Layin' it down full houses,
like it ain't no shit.

42:44.563 --> 42:45.562
Mmm-hmm.

42:45.564 --> 42:47.664
Yeah, I bet
you wish you were
playing for more

42:47.666 --> 42:49.666
than just butterscotch
and bottle caps, huh?

42:49.668 --> 42:53.169
You wanna put some
real money on it?

42:55.072 --> 42:58.908
Yeah, I don't think
you could afford it.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.111
Well, the way you're playing,

43:02.113 --> 43:04.013
I don't think I'm the one
that needs to be worried.

43:04.015 --> 43:07.116
Well, I'm not out yet.
I see I've got some
more bullshit here

43:07.118 --> 43:09.619
in my pocket
that I found out
in the field.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.288
We can get back
in this game here.

43:12.290 --> 43:14.157
That's my ante.

43:18.295 --> 43:20.129
Now look at that.

43:20.131 --> 43:22.865
Found that out there, too.

43:25.169 --> 43:27.804
What the hell is that?

43:27.806 --> 43:29.372
Ask him.

43:29.907 --> 43:35.244
Nate, this isn't funny.
Get that off the table. Now.

43:37.348 --> 43:42.085
You don't bring that
nasty shit out here
around my nephew.

43:42.820 --> 43:45.288
You understand me?

43:47.224 --> 43:48.825
Huh?

43:49.093 --> 43:52.195
Billy, you hear?

43:52.262 --> 43:54.330
I said, don't bring that...

43:54.932 --> 43:58.167
You actually think
I'd give that shit
to a kid?

43:58.169 --> 44:00.303
You crack head...
Boys!

44:15.219 --> 44:16.886
<i> Dad.</i>

44:16.888 --> 44:19.188
Hey, baby girl.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.960
Am I calling too late?

44:23.962 --> 44:26.129
<i> I'm not a toddler anymore.</i>

44:26.131 --> 44:30.233
<i> And it's Friday.</i>
<i> I can stay up till 9:00.</i>

44:31.135 --> 44:32.135
I'm sure you can.

44:32.137 --> 44:35.772
I just don't want
to get in trouble
with your mom is all.

44:35.774 --> 44:37.940
<i> You're always in</i>
<i> trouble with mama.</i>

44:37.942 --> 44:41.444
Oh, that's right.

44:43.915 --> 44:47.083
Is that the pup?
Is she around?

44:47.085 --> 44:48.151
<i> Yeah. Out in the yard.</i>

44:48.153 --> 44:50.086
<i> Must have thought</i>
<i> she saw something out back.</i>

44:50.088 --> 44:53.156
<i> She was crazy begging</i>
<i> to go out before you called.</i>

44:54.324 --> 44:56.125
That's too bad.

44:56.127 --> 44:58.294
I was hoping to say hi.

44:58.296 --> 45:00.930
<i> I'll pass it along.</i>

45:02.466 --> 45:05.034
<i> She misses you.</i>

45:07.004 --> 45:11.741
Well, you tell that
shaggy son of a bitch
i miss her, too.

45:15.245 --> 45:15.945
Hey.

45:15.947 --> 45:17.447
I got something i
want you to check out.

45:17.449 --> 45:19.916
<i> I gotta get ready for bed.</i>

45:22.086 --> 45:23.386
That's okay.

45:23.388 --> 45:25.088
That's all right.

45:25.090 --> 45:28.458
You just get
yourself tucked in
and listen.

45:28.460 --> 45:30.093
All right?

47:53.136 --> 47:56.873
McCoy, storm's comin'.
We're headed back to...

47:56.875 --> 48:00.343
You always snooping around
everybody's tent,
or am I just lucky?

48:00.345 --> 48:02.411
We've been calling you.

48:02.413 --> 48:04.914
What the hell
was that thing?

48:06.183 --> 48:08.284
Can I show you something?

48:11.521 --> 48:13.189
Yeah.

48:18.262 --> 48:20.162
This your Emily?

48:20.397 --> 48:23.299
That's her playing
with a dog there.

48:24.334 --> 48:26.335
We call her snickers.

48:26.337 --> 48:29.605
She wanted to name it after
something she liked.

48:30.674 --> 48:34.043
She wanted that
dog in the worst way.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.381
McCoy.

48:38.582 --> 48:40.516
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

48:40.518 --> 48:42.485
She's so smart, too.

48:42.487 --> 48:46.989
She does these little, like,
vocab crosswords.

48:47.291 --> 48:48.391
She got "panoply."

48:48.393 --> 48:52.495
Little eight-year-old kid,
i don't even
know what a panoply is.

48:52.497 --> 48:54.130
Wes.

48:57.534 --> 49:01.170
She's a lot smarter
than her old man.

49:05.042 --> 49:06.575
I used to

49:07.144 --> 49:09.545
work for some bad people.

49:10.447 --> 49:11.948
Cartel kind of bad.

49:11.950 --> 49:17.186
I got caught doing a run
and did some time for it.

49:19.556 --> 49:22.258
Cost 'em a lot of money.

49:22.326 --> 49:25.561
She don't know nothing
about those people.

49:25.662 --> 49:27.396
Why should she?

49:27.398 --> 49:29.432
It makes me sick.

49:32.536 --> 49:34.470
'Cause I did that.

49:39.042 --> 49:41.277
You can keep
trying to get...

49:41.279 --> 49:43.245
Just keep trying
to get ahead of it,
somehow.

49:43.247 --> 49:46.048
I tried to quit, tried to...

49:46.216 --> 49:47.984
But it's...

49:52.656 --> 49:54.457
I don't know.

49:57.160 --> 50:00.596
Sometimes I wonder,
maybe it'd be best
if I'm not around.

50:03.033 --> 50:05.434
Is that really
what you want?

50:15.679 --> 50:17.446
I, uh...

50:18.215 --> 50:21.484
I spent some time
inside, too.

50:22.552 --> 50:24.553
Three years.

50:24.555 --> 50:25.421
No shit.

50:25.423 --> 50:28.624
Yeah, the judge wanted
to make an example
of me, I guess.

50:28.626 --> 50:33.129
It didn't even matter
that I was pregnant.

50:33.697 --> 50:35.398
With...

50:35.665 --> 50:39.068
Yeah. I never even
got to hold him.

50:39.569 --> 50:40.403
Jesus.

50:40.405 --> 50:41.570
He went to live
with my dad

50:41.572 --> 50:45.274
'cause my husband
was already out of
the picture at that point.

50:45.809 --> 50:49.612
Then the FBI came down
on us, and it was just me
left to take the fall

50:49.614 --> 50:56.419
and I kept saying I didn't
know it was federal land.
It was Ethan who knew.

50:57.521 --> 51:01.557
But I don't even
know if that's true.

51:03.260 --> 51:05.127
Maybe I did.

51:07.431 --> 51:09.465
Maybe I know I did.

51:13.370 --> 51:17.840
I didn't even see Ezekiel
till after I got out.

51:19.109 --> 51:24.447
You know, not 'cause
i couldn't, but...

51:26.283 --> 51:30.786
And then when I did get home,
he didn't even know who I was.

51:31.088 --> 51:35.724
So, I spent every
spare moment out here

51:35.726 --> 51:39.862
'cause it just seemed
like it was better somehow.

51:40.163 --> 51:41.864
For both of us.

51:47.404 --> 51:50.473
Is that still
what you think?

51:54.811 --> 51:56.145
Anna, you coming?

51:56.147 --> 51:58.214
If we don't leave now,
we ain't leaving.

51:58.216 --> 52:01.183
Yeah. We're coming.

52:01.451 --> 52:02.518
Ah...

52:33.450 --> 52:34.850
Heard about the ruckus.

52:34.852 --> 52:37.920
That something
i ought to be worried about?

52:39.156 --> 52:41.357
He'll cool off.

52:41.725 --> 52:43.726
Long days.

52:43.728 --> 52:46.295
Lotta work.
Mmm-hmm.

52:49.866 --> 52:55.204
Did Nate ever tell you
how I happened to
come to know Wes?

52:55.772 --> 52:56.772
McCoy?

52:56.774 --> 53:00.409
I mean,
i guess I assumed...
I'm his sponsor.

53:03.580 --> 53:07.950
So, that means...
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

53:08.518 --> 53:14.590
Well, you know, I mean,
we were all young
and dumb once, right?

53:21.264 --> 53:24.567
Anyway, I just thought
it best you know it.

53:25.435 --> 53:29.672
Ain't nothing
I've ain't handled
a million times before.

53:31.741 --> 53:34.677
Ain't nothing
i can't handle now.

54:32.802 --> 54:36.805
You shouldn't
sneak up on folks.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.875
Oh, sorry.

54:41.378 --> 54:46.315
Come in out of the cold,
at least.
It's pissing rain outside.

54:53.490 --> 54:56.859
So, what's the deal?
You moping?

54:57.861 --> 54:59.695
I don't know.

55:00.297 --> 55:04.033
Well, I ain't gonna
yank it out of you.

55:06.403 --> 55:08.570
Didn't wanna come with,
at first.

55:08.572 --> 55:09.738
Mmm-hmm.

55:09.740 --> 55:12.441
And now
you're glad you did?

55:13.844 --> 55:17.446
Well, it makes me
miss my dad.

55:19.416 --> 55:20.516
Shit, kid.

55:20.518 --> 55:26.088
You know, dads ain't always
all they're cracked up to be.

55:27.324 --> 55:29.792
Yesterday don't mean Jack.

55:37.033 --> 55:38.367
What's that you got there?

55:38.369 --> 55:43.405
Oh, somebody told me
i was supposed
to give this to you.

55:44.341 --> 55:47.376
Who? Someone from the ranch?

55:47.644 --> 55:48.911
Uh, yeah, maybe.

55:48.913 --> 55:51.113
I haven't seen him before.

55:58.121 --> 55:59.855
Look, uh...

55:59.857 --> 56:01.724
Get inside.

56:03.093 --> 56:04.927
Head off to bed.

56:04.929 --> 56:06.695
Okay.

56:09.132 --> 56:12.468
And don't talk to no one else
you don't know.

56:47.670 --> 56:49.171
Fuck!

57:02.987 --> 57:06.422
Put your boss
on the phone, slick.

57:06.790 --> 57:09.491
I got his bones.

57:12.529 --> 57:14.129
You heard what I said?

57:14.131 --> 57:17.132
I'm tired of talking
to the fucking help.

57:17.200 --> 57:20.035
<i> El papa will come to you.</i>

57:20.136 --> 57:21.937
Fuck!

57:27.076 --> 57:29.011
Oh, what did they do to you?

57:43.660 --> 57:45.828
Well?
It's tight.

57:49.199 --> 57:51.934
You done good,
dinosaur lady.

57:52.469 --> 57:55.070
Thanks,
dinosaur fella.

57:55.072 --> 57:59.074
Oh. I've been promoted.

57:59.076 --> 58:01.543
I'm gonna go grab my pack,
then we can caravan
outta here.

58:01.545 --> 58:04.146
You got the keys
to the truck, right?.
Got it.

58:04.148 --> 58:05.514
Right,
let's get going.

58:05.516 --> 58:06.949
Hey, eze,
come on, let's go.

58:06.951 --> 58:09.117
Okay.
You got all
your stuff packed?

58:09.119 --> 58:10.686
Nope.
Come on,
let's load up.

58:10.688 --> 58:13.655
I wanna get out of here
before the sun sets.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.123
Okay.

58:16.559 --> 58:17.960
You got everything?

58:17.962 --> 58:20.596
Good boy.
Come on, let's go.

58:20.598 --> 58:23.565
Hey, Nate...

58:25.702 --> 58:27.970
Look, man, I just wanna...

58:27.972 --> 58:28.971
I wanna say I feel bad

58:28.973 --> 58:32.541
for how things got outta hand
at the fucking card game.

58:32.543 --> 58:33.675
No hard feelings.

58:43.821 --> 58:44.720
Nate!

58:44.722 --> 58:46.088
- Nate!
- Eze, stay down.

58:46.090 --> 58:47.856
Ezekiel, get down!

58:48.759 --> 58:50.926
- Ah, shit.
- Nate!

58:50.928 --> 58:53.662
You get in the car
and keep your head down.

58:54.531 --> 58:55.163
Nate!

58:55.165 --> 58:56.298
What the hell
is going on?

58:56.300 --> 58:59.835
- Stay right there.
- You hear me?

58:59.837 --> 59:00.869
Shit.
Mom!

59:00.871 --> 59:03.038
Are you guys okay?

59:03.908 --> 59:05.707
Oh, no.
No, not the keys.
Anna!

59:05.709 --> 59:07.910
Anna, what are you doing?
Get in the truck
and get outta here.

59:07.912 --> 59:10.746
- Keys!
- I lost the keys in the...

59:13.983 --> 59:18.086
- McCoy.
- What the hell is he doing?

59:19.255 --> 59:21.990
You motherfuckers
wanna kill me?

59:21.992 --> 59:23.725
You better aim straight!

59:23.727 --> 59:27.663
You hear me?
Stay right there.
You're okay.

59:28.031 --> 59:29.731
Mom!

59:31.835 --> 59:32.834
I can't find 'em.

59:32.836 --> 59:34.636
It's not worth it,
Anna, come on.

59:34.638 --> 59:37.072
We can't just
leave her here.

59:49.719 --> 59:53.689
I knew we never
should have trusted
that junkie son of a bitch.

59:53.691 --> 59:55.290
Ouch. Ouch!
Yeah, all right.

59:55.292 --> 59:56.992
I know, it will sting
like spitfire,

59:56.994 --> 59:58.193
but at least
it won't fall off.

59:58.195 --> 01:00:00.062
I still can't believe
we just left her out there.

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:05.701
Well, we have worse things
to worry about than
that dinosaur, doctor.

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.336
Where are you going?
McCoy ain't back yet.

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:10.973
Good.
That's enough, okay?
From both of you.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:13.842
Kim, this whole thing
is his fault.

01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:20.649
Well, I know that,
but I'm gonna go
look for him anyway.

01:00:27.191 --> 01:00:29.124
What you got there?

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:32.060
He said it was
for good luck.

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:35.163
Who did?

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:44.673
Fuck.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:53.181
Wait. Wait.
Wait, god damn it!

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:02.357
Just wait a minute
and listen to me, yeah?

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.838
Just hablar
for a fucking...

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.041
Goddamn...
English, English,
right now.

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:21.977
It's over, gringo.

01:01:21.979 --> 01:01:25.247
You make this easier
on yourself.

01:01:25.249 --> 01:01:28.216
You, or your daughter.

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:33.255
I can still pay,
all right? I can.

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:35.157
Don't be a coward.

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:38.360
Be a good father and die.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:43.065
No. No, no.
I have the t-Rex.
It's there. I have it.

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:46.334
Here?

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.905
Huh?

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:52.240
Pictures. Huh?

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.142
See?

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:58.346
Just like I said.

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:01.116
That's from today.

01:02:01.118 --> 01:02:02.884
It's already loaded up.

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:07.456
What I'm supposed to do
with a big, dead lizard?

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:08.990
Huh?

01:02:08.992 --> 01:02:11.426
You know exactly
fucking what.

01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:13.361
Auction it off.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:15.163
Black market?

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:20.102
The last one that complete
was an $8-million dead lizard.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.148
Don't be stupid.

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:39.755
You kill me,
I'm just another body.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:44.993
The grave
out in the badlands,
what's that worth?

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.398
You let me get
this fossil for you,

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:54.536
you'll get
a hell of a lot more
than I owe you.

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:57.839
Two ways to pay.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.542
It's the dinosaur.

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.878
Or it's me.

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.447
But you leave
my kid out of it.

01:03:07.851 --> 01:03:13.121
You're in tight spot
to be making threats,
<i>hombre.</i>

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.792
Then do it.

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:28.870
Tonight?

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.274
Tonight.

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.543
At the oil rig.

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:41.550
You'll get it tonight.

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.177
How many albums you got
in this shit house?

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.881
I don't know. Seven.

01:04:12.883 --> 01:04:14.115
Uh-huh.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:18.854
Well, you better
go get my lizard

01:04:18.856 --> 01:04:21.156
because you only got

01:04:21.158 --> 01:04:24.326
six-and-a-half tapes left.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.297
We gotta go back out there.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:06.167
Are you nuts, Anna?

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:09.504
You wanna just
leave her out there?

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:12.540
We already did
all the work. Okay?

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:15.911
She's just sitting out there,
exposed in the truck.

01:05:15.913 --> 01:05:19.314
Which you don't
have the keys to,
if you remember.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:22.317
Nobody else is
gonna get those keys.

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:24.419
Come on, hey.

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:28.924
Just relax. Go inside.
Think about your son.

01:05:30.426 --> 01:05:32.661
Oh, my god,
you're right.

01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:33.561
Good.

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:36.131
Thank you.
No, Nate,

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:38.566
he'd fit.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:43.338
What?
Ezekiel would fit
into the fissure.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.508
He could get the keys.
Are you insane?

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:49.311
I got shot out there.
I just got shot out there.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:50.712
You know the bullet
was meant for McCoy.

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:55.550
They're not still out there.
They're not thinking
we're gonna come back tonight.

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:57.352
You're not going
back out there.

01:05:57.354 --> 01:06:00.021
Ezekiel can't go
back out there.

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:01.723
Yes, I can.

01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:04.459
I can help with this. I can.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.161
No.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:08.163
No, eze. You can't.

01:06:08.165 --> 01:06:11.232
Mom, you said
you wanted my help.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.468
Let me do this.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.274
Anna.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.315
Anna, what are you...

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:50.438
Fuck.

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:54.235
Okay, you're doing great.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.841
Where are they?

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:09.084
They can't have gone too far.

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.675
Ezekiel.

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:35.542
Ezekiel.

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:38.145
Move back very slowly.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:42.750
I'm going in there,
Anna. Get him out of there.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.152
Ezekiel.

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:46.488
Get out of there, now.
Eze,
come on out of there.

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:57.564
Mom.
No. Come on, baby.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.268
Mom.

01:09:00.502 --> 01:09:01.435
Baby, come on.

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:03.270
- Come on. Ezekiel.
- Help.

01:09:03.273 --> 01:09:07.341
Come on.
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.810
I'm stuck.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:14.716
We got you. We got you.

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:15.850
Call for help.

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:18.620
Try to stay calm,
Anna. You hear me?

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:21.723
- Anna.
- Nate! Call someone.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.424
Are you bit?

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:26.861
Ezekiel, did it bite you?
Mom, I don't...

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:30.932
Oh, god.
Mom.

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:33.635
You're gonna be fine,
baby, okay?

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.738
Where's the...

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.546
There's only one.

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:47.515
Okay.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:50.551
Okay, ready?
Hold still.

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:56.191
Okay? Okay.

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.735
Mom, I broke
dad's watch.

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:10.438
That's okay, baby.
I'm here.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.708
I'm here.
Mom, I did it.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.910
I know, sweetheart.

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:18.379
No, I really did it.

01:10:23.452 --> 01:10:26.554
Yes. Yes, eze.

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:35.930
Come on, you piece of shit.
Give me something.

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:37.265
Can you hear me?

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:38.800
Eze's snake-bit,
we're up at the dig site.

01:10:38.802 --> 01:10:41.803
You gotta send
an ambulance...

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:48.676
<i>Is everyone okay?</i>

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.345
<i> Nate?</i>

01:10:50.347 --> 01:10:52.747
<i> Nate, goddamn it,</i>
<i> talk to me.</i>

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:57.018
<i> Nate. Nate.</i>

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:59.687
<i> What's going on over there?</i>

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:01.789
<i> Hello?</i>

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:39.894
Nate.

01:11:39.896 --> 01:11:41.763
Uncle Nate.

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:45.800
Nate, where are you?

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.308
Are you gonna be okay?

01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:54.475
Yeah.

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:55.510
Yeah. I'm gonna be fine.

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:58.946
Just have to find your uncle
and get to a hospital.

01:11:58.948 --> 01:12:01.683
I got the second bite,
so I got
the least of the venom.

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:02.717
I'm gonna be fine.

01:12:02.719 --> 01:12:04.819
We just gotta
get out of here.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:06.487
Okay, stay here.

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:08.323
Keep an eye out
for your uncle.

01:12:08.325 --> 01:12:11.526
I'm gonna go find a flare
and flag him down.

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.861
Okay.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.096
Okay.

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.826
Where the hell is
that stupid thing?

01:13:20.397 --> 01:13:22.830
Nate.
We gotta talk.

01:13:23.699 --> 01:13:25.166
McCoy!

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:28.503
Where the hell have you been?
What was that back there?

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:29.670
Don't get all excited.

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:33.074
People were shooting at us.
We could have died.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:35.109
People have died.

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:40.181
Where's Nate?
You come diggin'
in my shit,

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:43.684
I come diggin'
in yours.
McCoy?

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:46.053
I want those bones.

01:13:47.656 --> 01:13:49.891
You give me what's mine.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:52.794
I don't know what
you're talking about.
She's not yours.

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:56.931
Bullshit, she ain't mine.
She's been under my feet.

01:13:56.933 --> 01:14:02.103
McCoy, she isn't...
I found her. Me.

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:04.172
And I'm taking her,
all right?

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:06.874
And I don't
give a good goddamn
what I gotta do to do it.

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:12.713
Now, you still
gotta be all mean
and unpleasant?

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:15.817
You don't gotta
do this my way.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.854
You can do it
the nice way.

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:24.459
Give me the keys.

01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:37.071
Don't be stupid now.

01:14:37.073 --> 01:14:41.008
Use that big
science brain you got,
and don't be stupid.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:42.577
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:43.811
Nobody's trying
to cheat you...

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.947
I ain't got
a couple of years,
dinosaur woman.

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:48.216
I got fucking
five seconds.

01:14:48.218 --> 01:14:49.750
Just settle down.

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.552
Nobody's mad.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.089
Nobody's getting
excited now. Huh?

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:58.226
Friends.

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:00.928
Buddies.

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.930
Right?
Okay.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.632
Uh-huh.

01:15:06.636 --> 01:15:09.537
McCoy: I told you
i didn't want it this way!

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:14.108
Mom!

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:26.120
I told you
you didn't want it.

01:15:26.122 --> 01:15:30.525
I know you laugh at me.
I know you laugh.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:35.029
Daddy's coming
home now, baby girl.

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:21.142
Go. Go.

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:26.013
Close the door, baby.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.584
Mom!
No!

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:31.652
Mom, help!

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:36.157
Shut up.

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:37.325
Mom.
No.

01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:40.061
She's mine,
god damn it!

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:43.030
You'll bring her to me.

01:16:46.902 --> 01:16:48.703
Anna.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:51.305
Anna, where's eze?

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.074
Nate.

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:54.642
Nate.

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:56.277
Come on. Come on.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:16:58.212
He took my boy.

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.927
It's gonna be all right.

01:17:12.929 --> 01:17:15.997
Your mom's gonna
do the right thing.

01:17:15.999 --> 01:17:17.765
You'll see.

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:34.115
No!

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:37.885
Stop!

01:17:53.201 --> 01:17:55.302
Did you get bit, too?

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.715
Ezekiel?

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.185
Ezekiel?

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.131
Hey.

01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:25.332
I meant what I said.

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:28.302
You get me out
of here, you fuck!

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:36.977
Is she safe?

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:39.046
Is she safe?

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.196
Get out.
Shit.

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:34.301
It should have just stayed
in the ground.

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.456
Ezekiel? Ezekiel?

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:58.092
Baby, are you okay?
Wake up.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:20:00.027
Say something.

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:01.929
Ezekiel?

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.798
Say something.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.200
Wake up.
Mommy.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:14.341
You scared the bejesus
out of us, kid.

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.278
All out of bejesus now.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.184
Mom.

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:26.954
Mommy.

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:28.355
Mom.

01:20:28.357 --> 01:20:31.091
Mom. Mommy.

01:21:42.431 --> 01:21:44.665
Have you seen
this pile of crap?

01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:47.501
Which pile of crap
was that?

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:54.008
Dubai, huh?

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.643
Well, I guess
it doesn't matter,
really.

01:21:55.645 --> 01:21:58.579
We're in the badlands,
after all.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.415
There's always
more bones.

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:04.118
Should we tell
the doctor?

01:22:04.185 --> 01:22:06.921
Nah. She's busy.

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:10.257
<i>So, it's like</i>
<i> the rings in a tree?</i>

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:11.158
Exactly.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.460
Yeah, the rocks tell us
how old the earth is.

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:18.265
Each line
represents a milestone
of a few million years.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:22.970
They tell us more
about who we are,
where we came from.

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:26.273
Do you ever wish
you can go back?

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.042
See it yourself?

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.644
Once, maybe.
