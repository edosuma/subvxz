WEBVTT

00:01.209 --> 00:03.336
-Kill him, Bobby.
-Back up!

00:04.004 --> 00:06.423
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:08.008 --> 00:09.843
Officers, everybody hands on the table.

00:09.926 --> 00:10.760
What are you doing?

00:11.678 --> 00:14.014
Mom and pop crime
gets treated like the Brinks job.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.433
Cops preempt another
division's jurisdiction.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.435
A reasonable attorney is gonna wonder why.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.936
Not that I haven't thought about it.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.646
-About what?
-Us.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.024
In the same room without clothes.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.692
They put a deathtrap on the street.

00:25.775 --> 00:29.029
Did someone offer you money
to appear here and testify?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.280
Did they, Mr. Tully?

00:30.363 --> 00:31.865
That was my car back there!

00:31.948 --> 00:33.575
You shouldn't have parked
in a handicap zone.

00:33.658 --> 00:35.618
-You got what you deserved, buddy!
-Oh, yeah?

00:35.827 --> 00:39.122
Well, you take a look at this, buddy!
You are under arrest!

00:39.205 --> 00:41.207
Mr. Seltzer is in the market for a trade.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.376
-My security fund.
-Which contains?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.795
A lot of voices. A lot of conversations.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.465
Captain, I just finished listening
to those bookie tapes.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.800
-And?
-There's something you got to hear.

00:52.594 --> 00:55.180
(indistinct chatter)

00:55.263 --> 00:56.431
ESTERHAUS: Item seven.

00:57.182 --> 01:02.395
Sports fans, concerning tonight's
fistic extravaganza.

01:02.937 --> 01:06.232
The Police Athletic League's
Inter-precinct Boxing Tournament.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.276
Now I advise an early arrival

01:08.359 --> 01:12.072
as the first event
pits midtown middleweight Al Simmons

01:12.155 --> 01:15.283
against this precinct's own prize pugilist

01:15.366 --> 01:17.285
Officer Bobby Hill.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.913
(cheering)

01:22.624 --> 01:24.751
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.753
He's gonna be the champ of the Metro PD.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.464
(laughing, cheering)

01:31.925 --> 01:34.052
He's a poet and he knows it.

01:34.135 --> 01:36.262
ANDY: And my feet know it, too.
They're Longfellows.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.139
I hope you'll exhibit the same enthusiasm

01:38.223 --> 01:40.934
whilst purchasing tickets
from Officer Schnitz.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.521
Proceeds go towards reinstating
the PAL boxing program

01:44.604 --> 01:46.022
for underprivileged youth.

01:47.023 --> 01:51.694
Item eight. Officer Evans and Damico,
continue on sector C patrol

01:52.195 --> 01:55.281
substituting for Coffey and Bates

01:55.365 --> 01:57.408
entering the testimony phase

01:57.742 --> 02:00.787
in the Sheers-Heiser taxi death trial.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.331
Hey, Lucy, is that gonna be a wrap today?

02:03.414 --> 02:07.377
Well, maybe. They're trying to get
a plea bargain on Heiser this morning.

02:07.460 --> 02:08.837
Well, for those of you on the outside,

02:08.920 --> 02:11.881
we're pushing here
for any kind of conviction.

02:12.340 --> 02:15.927
We all know that Top Hat Cab's owner,
Bernard Heiser,

02:16.010 --> 02:19.222
has been putting deathtraps
on the street for years.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.600
Hey, go get him, Joe, Luce.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.896
Now let's all get tough
on Top Hat's vehicles, huh?

02:28.106 --> 02:29.482
Okay, let's roll.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.569
And let's be careful out there, huh?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.654
(indistinct chatter)

02:42.203 --> 02:44.205
That's over $1,000 raised already.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.166
You know that Daryl Ann
wants to come tonight?

02:46.249 --> 02:47.959
-Really?
-Yeah, she says she likes the fights.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.086
Can you imagine a sweet little thing
like that liking a fight?

02:50.170 --> 02:53.256
-How you feel, Bobby?
-Okay. Pretty good.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.466
I was wondering
how heavy to bet you tonight.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.636
I don't know, Leo. I once saw Al Simmons
rip the door off a Cadillac.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.930
-What'd he do that for?
-Guy tried to run over him.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.183
-He's over the hill.
-You're gonna murder him.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.767
-I don't know, Coff.
-Twice city

03:04.851 --> 03:07.187
Golden Glove welterweight champion.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.022
-Twice department middleweight champion.
-Ten years ago.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.399
-Ten years ago.
-Hey, my money's on you, kid.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.401
-I wouldn't be the farm.
-We'll be right back.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.445
-My bet's on, too, Bobby.
-Thanks, Leo.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.197
I mean, he's as old as you are.

03:20.783 --> 03:23.286
HOWARD: Bobby, I wonder if I can give you
a pointer for tonight.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.371
I don't need to know anything else
about boxing.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.873
Bear with me just a moment, will you?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.167
Ballantine. Ballantine, stay right here.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.211
-I want you to hit me with your left.
-Sir?

03:31.294 --> 03:36.132
Now the axiomatic principles..
is that the same energy used to block

03:36.216 --> 03:38.176
is released to launch the attack.

03:38.551 --> 03:39.928
-Come on, Ballantine.
-Yeah.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.388
Ha!

03:46.559 --> 03:47.727
You all right, Ballantine?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.145
BALLANTINE: Yes, sir. I think so.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.731
-Got to keep that left a little higher.
-Yes, sir.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.609
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

03:55.026 --> 03:56.736
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:56.819 --> 04:00.531
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:00.615 --> 04:02.325
(sirens wailing)

04:07.747 --> 04:11.668
(theme music playing)

05:16.858 --> 05:20.820
Captain, how come we're going out
to bust a bookie operation?

05:20.903 --> 05:23.823
-I thought bookmaking was illegal, Mick.
-And I thought it was handled by vice.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.366
How come we're doing their job?

05:25.450 --> 05:26.701
I went over there
a couple of days ago, Mick.

05:26.784 --> 05:29.120
The front's a candy store.
I went in to get some gum.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.372
They were doing business pretty openly.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.749
You mean right out front?

05:32.832 --> 05:35.251
No, but traffic in the back room
was pretty obvious.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.669
I called vice and reported it.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.214
-And they haven't made the bust yet.
-Nope.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.843
You think maybe there's a pan in vice?

05:45.219 --> 05:46.054
Captain?

05:46.888 --> 05:49.515
Captain, if there's cops on the take--

05:49.599 --> 05:50.600
One step at a time.

05:52.977 --> 05:57.065
When you and your partner first arrived
at the scene of the accident,

05:57.440 --> 06:00.068
who was sitting
behind the wheel of the cab?

06:01.819 --> 06:03.029
That man there, Raymond Sheers.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.365
BERNSTEIN:
And was there anybody else in the cab

06:05.448 --> 06:06.949
-with Mr. Sheers?
-No.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.036
So then, Officer Bates,
it might be correct to say

06:10.119 --> 06:12.288
that my client, Mr. Heiser,

06:12.372 --> 06:15.458
was nowhere in proximity to this incident?
Is that right?

06:15.541 --> 06:17.043
Except he owns the cab company.

06:17.126 --> 06:18.878
Please instruct the witness, Your Honor.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.714
Just answer the question
that's been put to you, Officer.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.549
No, he was nowhere in proximity.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.220
As a matter of fact, isn't it true
that Mr. Heiser's arrest

06:27.303 --> 06:30.056
is part of a personal vendetta
by the police department

06:30.139 --> 06:32.225
-and the district attorney's office?
-Objection! Objection!

06:32.308 --> 06:33.226
I don't know what you're talking about.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.644
And Mr. Heiser is in fact

06:34.727 --> 06:37.105
the object of a blatant legalistic
witch hunt?

06:37.188 --> 06:39.315
Leading, Your Honor,
beyond the witness's competence.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.984
Change your tone of voice, Mr. Bernstein.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.821
Stricken is calling for a conclusion.
Jury is to disregard.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.826
No further questions.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.751
You may step down. Next witness.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.171
BERNSTEIN:
The people call Mr. William Tully.

07:10.012 --> 07:13.057
You've testified, Mr. Tully, that you were
50 feet away from the incident.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.936
That you saw the cab operated by my client
drive up on the curb

07:17.019 --> 07:21.441
and I quote, "It was like it had
no steering, brakes or nothing."

07:22.525 --> 07:24.735
They put a deathtrap on the street. Right.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.864
Have you ever had training
in auto mechanics, Mr. Tully.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.032
No, ma'am.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.617
But cars don't go up on curbs

07:31.701 --> 07:33.786
unless there's something
the matter with them.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.456
-Thank you, Mr. Tully.
-Or the driver's drunk.

07:38.499 --> 07:42.044
Now drunk you say, Mr. Tully.
Did you smell the defendant's breath?

07:42.587 --> 07:44.422
Did you administer a breathalyzer test?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.549
Could you have passed a similar test
at the time?

07:46.632 --> 07:47.884
Objection. Move to strike.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.720
Sustained. Jury will disregard.

07:53.264 --> 07:57.393
Did the DA or the police offer you
any inducements for your testimony today?

07:57.477 --> 07:59.729
-No, ma'am.
-JOYCE: Did anybody?

08:01.230 --> 08:02.064
Like who?

08:03.941 --> 08:04.817
Like anybody?

08:05.526 --> 08:07.153
Did anybody offer you an inducement?

08:07.778 --> 08:08.988
What do you mean, "ducement?"

08:09.405 --> 08:11.407
Offer you money. Anything of value.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.409
A free ride on a case.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.496
So to lie? (scoffs)
Absolutely not.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.580
To do what then?

08:18.998 --> 08:22.293
Did someone offer you money
to appear here and testify?

08:23.085 --> 08:24.462
Did they, Mr. Tully?

08:26.297 --> 08:27.256
Well, now, hold it.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.592
Let me ask you a hypothetical.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.011
I go to Florida in the fall.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.347
Now if somebody
was to lay a few bucks on me

08:34.430 --> 08:37.850
-so I could stay around here--
-Who offered you a few dollars, Mr. Tully?

08:41.270 --> 08:42.271
Answer the question, sir.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.527
The guy with the cop. Dead guy's brother.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.986
Otherwise he would have left town.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.863
He wouldn't honor his legal subpoena.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.114
-(bangs gavel)
-Quiet. Quiet.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.699
Judge, will you instruct the jury

08:53.783 --> 08:55.952
as to the proper way
to assign bought testimony?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.286
-Objection.
-JUDGE: Overruled.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.122
The people's only eyewitness
in this entire case

09:00.206 --> 09:03.292
and his testimony can be bought and sold
for the price of a meal.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.255
No further questions, Your Honor.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.299
You may step down.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.136
Will defense be putting in a case?

09:15.054 --> 09:16.055
No, your Honor.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.808
Very well. Summations at 2:00.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.518
Adjourn for lunch. One hour.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.937
What about the other eligible witnesses?

09:23.020 --> 09:24.522
There's Delatio and Gilbert.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.816
These guys make Tully
look like Nobel Prize material.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.317
Tully's been discredited now.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.611
Find Gilbert fast.
I'll review his statement.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.988
We'll put him on after lunch.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.825
Look, I'm sorry.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.244
-He was my--
-I know, he was your brother.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.379
What do you want? Want do you want?

09:48.462 --> 09:50.172
-Don't do that.
-What are you doing?

09:50.256 --> 09:53.676
What's going--
Hey, don't do-- don't do that.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.596
Police officers.
Everybody, hands on the table.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.930
What are you doing? Feeding the fish?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.765
-Get those out of there.
-Stop it.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.267
Come on, call down.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.019
Where the hell are you going, mouse?

10:03.102 --> 10:06.105
Uh-uh-uh! You are under arrest.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.982
Ben Seltzer, officer.
What seems to be our problem?

10:08.065 --> 10:10.610
Ain't no problem, Mr. Seltzer.
We're just busting your place.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.653
I can see that.
I mean, what's our problem?

10:12.737 --> 10:15.364
Hey, look, you got too much to say.
You're under arrest.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.116
Detective Washington here
is gonna read you your rights.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.285
-Now come on over here.
-You're under arrest, Ben.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.703
You have the right to remain silent.

10:21.203 --> 10:24.206
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.626
What seems to be happening here
is actually happening?

10:26.709 --> 10:28.544
-You got it, Ben.
-This is a hell of a morning.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.796
I mean, this is really
actually taking place?

10:31.422 --> 10:32.632
At least get my coat.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.926
-Okay.
-Yeah, Ben. (chuckles)

10:36.010 --> 10:37.345
Here's that rainy day.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.306
Look, I only work here.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.183
Where are you taking me, man?

10:42.266 --> 10:44.268
BEN: What office are you guys from?
I don't understand it.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.062
(growls)

10:47.271 --> 10:49.565
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.108
(man shouts)

10:53.152 --> 10:55.363
What the hell do you want?
Get out of my way!

10:56.989 --> 10:59.200
Get out of my way! Move!

11:08.042 --> 11:10.670
You okay? No, no, no.

11:10.753 --> 11:12.838
I just want to get back in the chair.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.674
Let me get off the ground, okay?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.846
I can do it. Get your hands off me.

11:27.395 --> 11:29.063
I said get your hands off me.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.606
That was my car back there!

11:30.690 --> 11:32.316
You shouldn't have parked
in a handicap zone.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.360
-You got what you deserved, buddy.
-Oh, yeah?

11:34.568 --> 11:36.237
Well, you take a look at this, buddy.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.030
You are under arrest!

11:45.162 --> 11:46.956
You know, I really like that girl.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.001
I mean, no one's gonna mistake Daryl Ann
for a rocket scientist, you understand?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.797
Time! That's good.
That's good. That's good.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.507
Have some water.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

11:56.590 --> 11:58.759
(mumbles) I don't know, man.
I don't know.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.512
Get your mitts on the bag. Come on.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.723
Renko, it used to be a lot easier, man.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.600
-I'm just dead.
-I know it, kid. But no pain, no gain.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.310
Don't be lame. Don't go insane.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.979
-Oh, mama.
-Don't call for your mama.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.856
Call for Al Simmons. Pick up your faith.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.817
Ready, time, go. Huh, huh, huh!

12:14.900 --> 12:16.902
That's right, punch. Uppercut. Uppercut.
Get mad.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.988
Get cracking. Uppercut. Uppercut.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.949
You know, she's just so nice.
I mean, she's so-so natural.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.577
And I think I'm real sweet on her,
you know what I mean?

12:24.660 --> 12:26.537
Okay, now beat him to the punch.
Beat him to the punch.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.039
Stick 'em, stick 'em. Okay, rabbit punch.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.459
He's going mad.
He's throwing punches in bunches.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.336
Besides, she's a little bit country,
but I'm county, too.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.213
-Renko.
-I know, man.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.174
Give me ten more seconds, man,
come on now.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.176
Think of Al Simmons' ugly face.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.803
Give him a meat hook. Hook. Hook.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.930
One more! One more! One more!

12:45.264 --> 12:46.432
Yes!

12:48.392 --> 12:51.145
You know what?
I think she's kind of sweet on me, too.

12:51.228 --> 12:53.522
I mean, she's real pretty.
Don't you think she's pretty?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.859
Andy, I got no wind.
(panting)

12:56.942 --> 12:58.944
Andy, I got no wind.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.740
If I don't get him inside of 30 seconds,
I'm gonna die.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.700
Now that is the kind
of defeatist bullpucky

13:04.784 --> 13:06.535
that will put you away every single time.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.703
I don't want to hear
one more word like that.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.371
I'm 34 years old, Andy.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.165
I ain't been in a ring in six years.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.417
-But you've been in fights.
-But not in the ring.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.213
Can I help you, bud?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.177
I know you. Don't I?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.470
Sugar Ray Robinson.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.263
No, that's not it.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.099
-Wait a minute.
-BOBBY: Bobby Hill.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.392
Right.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.353
-You're a fighter, too, aren't you?
-Right.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.980
Yeah, "Irish" Bobby Shields.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.817
Hey, we-- we busted you
on a B&amp;E two years ago.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.444
-Good to see you again.
-How you doing?

13:40.528 --> 13:43.489
Uh, good. Good. Real good.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.991
Yeah. Did a 16-month bid.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.537
Got out, uh, three weeks ago.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.080
Couple fights coming up.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.124
-No kidding.
-Right out of the box.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.044
Still got that jab, you know?

13:59.171 --> 14:02.299
So, uh, didn't I read,

14:02.758 --> 14:05.427
uh, you won a sweepstakes or something?

14:07.096 --> 14:09.348
-Lottery, yeah.
-Yeah, so...

14:10.140 --> 14:11.767
I got this fight coming up,

14:12.351 --> 14:14.311
but I lost my mouthpiece in the joint.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.274
(stammering)
So I've been using toilet paper.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.775
You know, wadded up.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.652
Beats the hell out of your gums.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.113
-That's too bad.
-Yeah.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.490
So, uh, I was wondering, you know,

14:26.574 --> 14:29.660
if somebody could pop
for a mouthpiece for the fights,

14:29.743 --> 14:33.080
then it would really help me,
and I could pay them right back.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.540
'Cause, uh...

14:36.458 --> 14:37.793
it costs $80.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.005
I don't think so, Bobby.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.093
So...

14:47.595 --> 14:49.013
you got a fight or something?

14:50.598 --> 14:52.391
Yeah, amateur, tonight.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.893
Three rounds, huh?

14:54.935 --> 14:57.646
You need a good cornerman? I come cheap.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.399
Thanks anyway. I got it covered.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.193
Okay.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.367
Make a big meal of lunch.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.245
Don't eat too much after lunch.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.000
Okay. You take care, Bobby.

15:22.504 --> 15:23.881
Pancakes and liver.

15:26.050 --> 15:26.884
See you.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.513
Yo, Bobby.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.183
-Bobby.
-Yeah?

15:37.561 --> 15:38.771
Take care of yourself, man.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.107
Double sawbuck.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.860
Hey, thanks a lot.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.320
You know, I saw you fight once.

15:47.905 --> 15:48.739
How'd I do?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.408
-You won.
-Oh, great.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.079
That's-- that's really good. That's good.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.041
Hey, take care of yourself.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.882
I told you guys everything,
all you got to do is listen.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.884
Okay, Leo. We got 30 minutes.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.804
We need to get this guy clothed
and down to the courtroom. Suggestions?

16:11.887 --> 16:14.223
How about some Dr. Denton's with feet?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.934
-Come on, Leo.
-I'll see what's in lost and found.

16:17.017 --> 16:20.980
Wool scratches me up.
I got to have polyester or wool blended.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.690
-Okay.
-Hey, mama!

16:22.773 --> 16:25.401
-No!
-Luboff. Irv Luboff.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.987
-He's with Luboff, Fine and Gold.
-Great law firm.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.447
You got to shorten your name
to be a partner. Come on.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.158
Sit.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.081
Don't do that.

16:46.714 --> 16:47.548
Name?

16:48.173 --> 16:49.675
Gaffney. Gerry.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.136
Gerry with a J or a G?

16:52.594 --> 16:54.221
G, as in gimp.

16:56.056 --> 16:56.890
(snorts)

16:57.766 --> 16:58.934
What the hell is so funny?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.145
You trying to catch me.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.605
Man, I had you beat
if it hadn't been for that other car.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.065
Bull. I was gaining.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.859
Oh, you were sucking dust.

17:11.363 --> 17:12.990
How fast could you go on that thing?

17:14.283 --> 17:15.993
I've been clocked at 23 on a straight.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.411
Hmm.

17:18.287 --> 17:21.123
See, I got a slightly narrow wheel base
on a 27-inch diameter.

17:21.206 --> 17:24.209
Double-butted tubing in the frame
and I sit two inches lower in the seat.

17:24.293 --> 17:27.838
Plus, I work out. I can curl 150 pounds
and do chin-ups all day long

17:27.921 --> 17:30.257
and one of these days
I'm gonna break 25 miles per hour.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.885
But beyond that, the chair has got
stability problems that I got to work out.

17:32.968 --> 17:36.055
Maybe I should have arrested you
for speeding instead.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.974
Hey, why don't you charge yourself
for parking in a handicap zone?

17:39.058 --> 17:39.892
That'd be a first, wouldn't it?

17:39.975 --> 17:43.062
You got no right to go around
defacing other people's property.

17:43.145 --> 17:46.231
You got no right going around
violating other people's rights.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.569
Look, man, you can do
whatever you want to me.

17:50.652 --> 17:52.821
You want to throw me in jail?
Throw me in jail.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.407
But I'm telling you, as soon
as I'm back out on the street again

17:55.491 --> 17:56.909
and I see somebody in that space

17:56.992 --> 17:59.244
who doesn't have a right to be,
it gets the paint.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.081
Your chief of police, he's in that space,
he's gonna get the paint.

18:02.456 --> 18:06.168
The President of the United States
is in that space, he gets the paint.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.344
What's the matter?

18:20.057 --> 18:21.100
I got to go to the john.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.228
That way and make it quick.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.901
What are you waiting for?

18:33.153 --> 18:34.947
Is the stall wheelchair accessible?

18:36.365 --> 18:37.199
I don't know.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.369
'Cause if it ain't,
I'm gonna need some help.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.292
Let's go.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.554
(sighs)

19:01.640 --> 19:02.474
Yeah.

19:03.934 --> 19:04.768
All right.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.939
You're gonna have to pick me up
and put me down.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.279
-Come on, man. I don't have all day.
-All right.

19:16.905 --> 19:17.739
Up to there.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.242
-You ready?
-Yeah.

19:20.909 --> 19:21.743
All right.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.584
(grunts) All right.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.210
Move the chair.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.675
Now pull my pants down.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.596
I got a bag on my leg, so watch that.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.182
Watch the bag, man.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.605
Now, grab me under the arms again.

19:50.898 --> 19:51.773
All right.

19:52.482 --> 19:53.984
-Where?
-Over there.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.694
All right. You ready?

19:55.777 --> 19:57.779
-Yeah. Come on.
-Okay.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.782
-I got it.
-Hold on, man!

20:00.866 --> 20:02.743
(grunts)

20:03.994 --> 20:05.037
MICK: I'm sorry.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.455
Get me up.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.165
Get me up!

20:20.510 --> 20:21.345
Get out of here.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.972
Come on, get out of here, man!

20:26.725 --> 20:27.559
(shouts)

20:29.436 --> 20:31.063
I-- Absolutely.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.946
-Yes?
-Irv Luboff, Captain.

20:39.029 --> 20:41.573
I represent Benjamin Seltzer
on these book making charges.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.616
He's in interrogation.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.993
He's also
in the Hill Street station house.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.454
It strikes me as a little odd
since gambling enforcement's

20:47.537 --> 20:49.957
been coming out of division vice
ever since the Heywood Commission.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.000
Well, it's back in the precincts
for today.

20:52.084 --> 20:52.918
Why?

20:54.544 --> 20:57.589
Statutes are in the books, Mr. Luboff.
What's it to you who enforces them?

20:57.673 --> 21:00.259
A mom and pop crime
gets treated like the Brinks job.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.511
Cops preempt
another division's jurisdiction.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.013
A reasonable attorney is gonna wonder why.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.516
Maybe the department's just after its own.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.435
It's a free country.
You're entitled to your speculations.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.312
Is that what it's about, Captain?

21:12.396 --> 21:14.022
I mean, you think some of the cops
were on the take.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.066
-Make your point.
-'Cause if that's what you're after,

21:16.149 --> 21:18.026
I think Ben Seltzer can help you.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.708
Captain, I've been in the business
a long time.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.418
Long before the Heywood Commission.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.421
I've seen a lot of cops come and go
and they weren't all scouts.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.631
I ain't a violent man, Captain.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.050
I know how to take care of myself
in other ways.

21:42.968 --> 21:43.802
And?

21:45.053 --> 21:46.305
My security fund.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.850
Been in cold storage 15 years.
Right next to the misses' furs.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.394
Mr. Seltzer's in the market for a trade.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.315
Reduction to a misdemeanor
in exchange for his security fund.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.152
-Which contains?
-A lot of voices. Lot of conversations.

22:00.235 --> 22:03.530
-Whose?
-Oh, there's so many. So long ago.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.076
Listen, Captain,
then tell me can we do business?

22:09.202 --> 22:11.496
I have nothing more to say.

22:12.956 --> 22:13.790
J.D.

22:14.791 --> 22:16.710
Yeah, we got a reel-to-reel downstairs.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.211
See me when you're through.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.547
My client has duplicates
in another location.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.183
I know definitely it jumped the curb.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.269
Like this. Almost clipped me.

22:34.561 --> 22:36.813
I had to dive out the way myself.

22:36.897 --> 22:39.566
Why did you wait until now
to come forward, Mr. Gilbert?

22:40.317 --> 22:43.278
Ma'am, I told the police what's happening.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.739
They said they didn't need me.

22:46.114 --> 22:49.284
(chuckles) Which I can understand.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.952
Have you been drinking today?

22:52.621 --> 22:54.998
Yes, ma'am. Yes, I have been.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.959
But that don't stop me
from remembering the sight of death.

22:58.668 --> 23:00.379
That cab come up there like a demon.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.422
Like the driver
was trying to turn the wheel,

23:02.506 --> 23:03.840
but he couldn't do nothing.

23:04.758 --> 23:05.884
Like I was saying,

23:06.968 --> 23:10.889
T4692.

23:11.306 --> 23:12.974
That's the license plate number.

23:13.642 --> 23:14.893
The cab was like a demon.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.229
Like the devil's car.

23:17.854 --> 23:20.607
Just killed that poor innocent man.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.444
No further questions.

23:25.612 --> 23:26.696
Witness step down.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.407
BERNSTEIN: The people rest.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.492
-JUDGE: Summations.
-GILBERT: Hey!

23:31.368 --> 23:33.912
Hey, I'm buck naked! I'm buck naked!

23:33.995 --> 23:36.581
I'm buck naked! I'm buck naked!

23:36.665 --> 23:38.834
I'm buck naked, buck naked, buck naked!

23:39.251 --> 23:40.919
JUDGE: Contempt! Cover him up!

23:41.002 --> 23:44.423
GILBERT (laughs):
I'm buck naked! Buck naked! Buck naked!

23:44.506 --> 23:47.801
I'm buck naked! Hey, I'm buck naked!

23:55.767 --> 23:57.310
MAN: Get out of here. I got it.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.440
You were pretty good in there.

24:02.190 --> 24:05.402
You articulated that stuff about
what your types go through pretty good.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.238
Yup. I should have been acquitted, too.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.158
-You got a fair sentence.
-I notice he didn't do nothing to you.

24:11.992 --> 24:14.953
(sighs) Okay, so now
I get to educate the police

24:15.036 --> 24:16.830
for 20 hours on disabled rights.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.958
Are you supposed to judge me
20 one-hour lectures?

24:20.041 --> 24:22.711
Ten two-hour lectures?
Who am I supposed to lecture to?

24:22.794 --> 24:25.422
Each precinct? (scoffs)
No, the police academy.

24:25.505 --> 24:26.590
That'd be where it would do the most good.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.425
Maybe you ought to think on it awhile.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.886
You know there are over
30,000 wheelchairs in this city?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.345
Thirty-thousand.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.558
I've been thinking about going undercover
as one of you guys.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.059
Maybe you could give me some pointers.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.604
-(elevator dings)
-Forget it.

24:41.188 --> 24:42.022
Why?

24:42.105 --> 24:43.857
'Cause that's something you can't fake.

24:44.941 --> 24:45.817
It takes soul.

24:51.406 --> 24:53.742
Coffey. How's it going?

24:53.825 --> 24:55.368
Think you're gonna get that Heiser guy?

24:55.452 --> 24:57.996
Who knows?
Our last witness flashed the jury.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.789
-Jury's in.
-So soon?

24:59.873 --> 25:00.790
What does that mean?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.425
-Has the jury reached a verdict?
-We have, Your Honor.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.011
Will the defendants please rise
and face the jury?

25:17.599 --> 25:20.519
The jury will announce its verdict
in regard to Raymond Sheers.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.521
The jury finds the defendant
guilty as charged

25:22.604 --> 25:24.105
of voluntary manslaughter.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.774
JUDGE: In respect to Bernard Heiser?

25:26.483 --> 25:30.278
The jury finds the defendant guilty
as charged of voluntary manslaughter.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.532
JUDGE: Motions, people?

25:33.865 --> 25:39.287
I serve notice to the DA as per CCP-3719,
notice of intent to appeal.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.040
CCP-420, motion to vacate verdict.

25:43.166 --> 25:46.211
-Mr. DA?
-Motion to vacate is groundless.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.506
Would you all be seated, please?

25:55.053 --> 25:58.431
AS regards to motion to vacate verdict,
you have nothing more to say?

25:58.515 --> 26:00.475
(stammers)
The people's case, the jury's verdict

26:00.559 --> 26:03.311
-is self-evident, Your Honor.
-Not to me they aren't.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.232
The crimes committed
in this matter are heinous.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.985
Therefore it grieves me
all the more to say

26:10.068 --> 26:14.322
that the conduct of the police
and prosecution in this case

26:14.406 --> 26:18.577
have been far below what minimal standards
of judicial equity require.

26:19.327 --> 26:23.123
What evidence was brought forward
in which defendants could be convicted?

26:23.832 --> 26:27.752
The only eyewitnesses were a hireling
and a pantsless inebriant.

26:27.877 --> 26:28.753
(crowd murmuring)

26:28.837 --> 26:31.590
I conclude that the guilty verdicts
are against reason,

26:32.340 --> 26:36.261
insupportable and prejudiced
and I hereby vacate them.

26:36.803 --> 26:37.637
(bangs gavel)

26:37.721 --> 26:39.931
Prosecution will, of course,
take its appeal.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.808
(crowd murmuring)

26:47.397 --> 26:49.524
-Hey, can they do that?
-Your Honor, this jury

26:49.608 --> 26:51.401
heard and weighed four days of testimony.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.611
Three days of experts.

26:52.694 --> 26:55.196
-This is wrong.
-Quiet. Quiet.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.657
But they're criminals.
These are criminals.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.869
-And you, Judge, you're a criminal.
-Silence or contempt.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.621
(murmuring)

27:07.334 --> 27:09.461
Can he do that? Just change the guilty
to not guilty like that?

27:09.544 --> 27:11.212
For the record, people will appeal.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.589
Can we win in appeal?

27:12.797 --> 27:14.716
You kidding? One chance in ten.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.302
This court stands adjourned
till 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.013
You know, those guys were bums,
but they spoke more truth

27:20.096 --> 27:20.972
than you did up there today.

27:21.389 --> 27:23.558
-Behave yourself, officer.
-Let's go.

27:24.726 --> 27:25.560
That's not right.

27:31.107 --> 27:32.567
HENRY: I don't know, Fay.
The man just formed

27:32.651 --> 27:34.819
a women's rights commission.
I think it's a safe bet

27:34.903 --> 27:38.156
if he's called to meet with you again
he's got something special in mind.

27:38.823 --> 27:42.369
Uh, well, you can tell me all about it
at dinner.

27:43.870 --> 27:44.829
Don't be nervous.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.123
Just be yourself. Pick you up at 8:00.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.585
Vacated the verdict?

27:50.960 --> 27:53.755
Rare, but it happens
when a judge gets fed up enough.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.007
Damn it. Did my guys do that bad a job?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.509
No, they didn't.

27:57.592 --> 27:59.761
It's just a funny set of circumstances.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.098
Your client got off. Why the long face?

28:03.556 --> 28:06.267
It's just-- something's not kosher.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.937
Heiser looked like he didn't have
a care in the world.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.774
And it's true the eyewitnesses were weak,
but their testimony was sound.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.777
You're talking about a judge
with an impeccable service record.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.865
-I'm running late.
-See you tonight.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.119
Oh, hi, Ms. Davenport.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.455
Captain, I just finished listening
to those bookie tapes.

28:27.872 --> 28:28.707
And?

28:29.874 --> 28:31.209
There's something you got to hear.

28:35.463 --> 28:38.383
Man, I'm telling you, I don't have to
fill this thing out. The judge--

28:38.466 --> 28:40.176
Sir, I already explained to you.

28:40.260 --> 28:43.054
Nobody lectures without first
setting a day and a time with me

28:43.138 --> 28:45.223
and I don't have any open dates
till the 19th.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.851
I should have known you guys wouldn't be
interested in hearing what I had to say.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.936
-But this whole thing is bogus.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:50.019 --> 28:51.855
-Calm down.
-What do you want?

28:53.314 --> 28:54.149
Come here.

28:56.901 --> 28:57.736
Come here.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.120
What the hell was going on back there?

29:07.662 --> 29:09.539
"The Predicament of the Disabled."

29:09.998 --> 29:11.332
I wrote up my lecture.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.251
It's a good title. I like that.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.253
Yeah, well, when I asked four-eyes
for a room,

29:15.336 --> 29:16.546
he immediately says no dice.

29:16.629 --> 29:19.591
-I can't get on the schedule for a month.
-You got to wait your turn.

29:20.633 --> 29:22.510
Oh, you, too, huh?

29:22.594 --> 29:23.595
Whoa.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.348
If you think you're going off to paint
more cars, you're wrong.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.100
No, I was thinking dynamite this time.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.770
You go back up to the desk
and you get a date to talk to the men.

29:31.853 --> 29:34.022
You don't leave here until you do that.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.192
-You think you can stop me from leaving?
-Yeah.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.195
Because I'm in a wheelchair
you think you can handle me?

29:40.987 --> 29:43.573
Well, if I can't,
I'll find six cops who can.

29:49.704 --> 29:50.538
All right.

29:51.498 --> 29:52.791
I'll get on the schedule.

29:55.877 --> 29:56.795
You like fights?

29:58.546 --> 29:59.380
Boxing?

30:02.133 --> 30:03.843
Yeah. I guess.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.846
How about going to the fights with me?

30:07.305 --> 30:08.848
Well, would you like to do that?

30:12.227 --> 30:13.061
Yeah.

30:14.771 --> 30:16.898
I don't know if this place
has a ramp, though.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.358
We'll work it out.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.109
I got a police escort, don't I?

30:20.902 --> 30:21.736
Yeah.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.700
HOWARD: You want to see me, Frank?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.786
Yeah, would you close the door,
please, Howard?

30:32.121 --> 30:33.373
I want you to hear something.

30:33.456 --> 30:36.125
Uh... it's from a few years back.

30:38.586 --> 30:40.505
BEN (on tape): <i>Morning, officer.</i>
<i>What's your pleasure?</i>

30:40.588 --> 30:41.923
HOWARD (on tape): <i>The crullers, please.</i>

30:42.173 --> 30:43.091
BEN: <i>Sorry?</i>

30:44.843 --> 30:47.220
HOWARD: <i>The crullers. A box of crullers.</i>

30:47.303 --> 30:49.597
BEN: <i>Oh, Detective Douglas' crullers.</i>

30:50.139 --> 30:51.099
HOWARD: <i>That's right.</i>

30:51.808 --> 30:54.519
BEN: <i>Here you go. Everything's in the box.</i>

30:55.019 --> 30:56.187
<i>Bottom of the box.</i>

30:57.438 --> 30:58.273
HOWARD: <i>All right.</i>

30:59.065 --> 31:00.859
BEN: <i>Don't eat it all in one place.</i>

31:00.942 --> 31:02.443
(laughs)

31:02.986 --> 31:04.946
HOWARD:
<i>Detective Douglas wouldn't like that.</i>

31:06.364 --> 31:09.033
(door opens, closes)

31:10.034 --> 31:12.203
BEN: <i>Badge number 1146.</i>

31:12.495 --> 31:13.830
<i>Patrolman H. Hunter.</i>

31:14.330 --> 31:16.207
<i>Payoff for Douglas and Callie.</i>

31:16.708 --> 31:17.542
(turns tape off)

31:21.004 --> 31:22.046
You're on tape three times.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.007
It's all pretty much
the same conversation.

31:30.430 --> 31:33.057
When it happened,
I was six weeks on the force.

31:35.143 --> 31:36.102
(sighs)

31:36.477 --> 31:38.897
A couple of detectives tapped me
to do the run once a week

31:38.980 --> 31:41.608
at this, uh, pastry shop.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.236
The money was out of sight.
It was in a box of crullers,

31:45.778 --> 31:46.821
Did you take any?

31:51.034 --> 31:52.076
No.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.828
Not that that makes any difference.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.246
But you knew the contents?

31:57.540 --> 31:58.666
Not to begin with.

32:00.001 --> 32:03.129
Not till one of the sergeants
in the precinct told me how it was.

32:04.839 --> 32:05.673
(sighs)

32:08.927 --> 32:11.220
How was that for the most naive...

32:12.931 --> 32:14.349
rookie story you ever heard?

32:14.891 --> 32:17.185
You were 28 years old, Howard.
You were hardly a kid.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.648
In the back of my mind
I knew it from the start.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.024
Then why?

32:26.486 --> 32:27.320
I don't know.

32:29.781 --> 32:30.782
(sighs)

32:31.699 --> 32:32.700
I...

32:33.743 --> 32:34.577
(scoffs)

32:36.120 --> 32:37.747
I had just gotten back from Vietnam.

32:38.164 --> 32:39.791
After what I'd seen over there,

32:40.583 --> 32:43.086
the corruption
in the very fabric of things,

32:44.170 --> 32:45.380
seemed no different here.

32:46.589 --> 32:47.882
I decided that, uh,

32:49.467 --> 32:51.761
it was beyond me to address all that.

32:51.844 --> 32:54.055
That others could govern their lives,

32:54.138 --> 32:55.390
I would govern mine.

32:56.683 --> 32:57.517
(chuckles)

33:01.062 --> 33:02.105
The fact is,

33:02.814 --> 33:05.692
I was too much a coward
to confront those detectives, Frank,

33:05.775 --> 33:08.111
and I put in for a transfer instead.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.906
And when that transfer didn't come
for two months...

33:13.992 --> 33:15.994
I continued to make the pickups.

33:19.038 --> 33:20.707
We have to be practical, Howard.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.168
Because of the amount of time
that's gone by, you can't be prosecuted.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.337
But this information
is gonna have to circulate.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.631
It's gonna be in your jacket.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.009
I understand
that you initiated this operation, Frank.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.928
There's nothing I can do about it now,
Howard. It's gone too far.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.263
No, no, no. Don't get me wrong.

33:35.346 --> 33:38.016
I-- I'm glad it stands revealed.

33:39.517 --> 33:41.936
Fifteen years ago,
I was handed the broken saber,

33:42.520 --> 33:45.773
and I have kept it hidden under my tunic
all these years.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.652
I have failed the people
who gave me their trust.

33:52.363 --> 33:53.531
I failed you, Frank.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.451
And for that, I'm sorry.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.078
And I apologize.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.790
Howard, it's just poor judgment.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.004
But in the context of what I fully expect

34:08.087 --> 34:11.758
to continue to be
a highly distinguished career.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.176
May I go?

34:26.105 --> 34:28.691
Hey, Andy,
remember four years ago at Flugie's

34:28.775 --> 34:31.652
when Al Simmons took on
the Riverview JC football team?

34:31.736 --> 34:33.696
-Yeah.
-Yeah, they slaughtered him, right?

34:33.780 --> 34:36.449
-Yeah, but that was--
-But he put six of them in traction.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.576
Hey, the guy was using a two-by-four.

34:39.952 --> 34:41.245
Hey, you're not worried, are you, Bobby?

34:41.329 --> 34:43.831
No, he is not. Come on, Bobby.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.000
-We got to pick up Daryl Ann.
-Catch you over there, babe.

34:46.084 --> 34:49.128
No, sweat, kid, all right. Simmons
couldn't win a geriatrics tournament.

34:49.212 --> 34:52.131
-The guy is history.
-He's the same age as I am.

34:53.216 --> 34:54.050
ANDY: Come on!

34:56.677 --> 34:57.720
Hey-hey, Lieutenant.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.182
You better snap it up
if we're gonna make it to the bout.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.559
-What?
-The bout.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.437
You know, the fight. Bobby's fighting.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.774
Oh, the fight. Well, I'm afraid
I won't be able to go, John.

35:11.109 --> 35:15.863
Lieutenant, if you're worried
about what was on that tape, don't be.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.406
Everybody makes mistakes.

35:17.490 --> 35:19.492
(chuckles) Hell, ask the man who knows.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.080
As a matter of fact,
I was thinking about Midway.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.958
Oh. Midway to what?

35:27.750 --> 35:30.086
(chuckles) It was a sea battle. WWII.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.296
It changed the course
of the war in the Pacific.

35:34.465 --> 35:38.469
At one point, three squadrons
of obsolete American torpedo bombers

35:38.553 --> 35:41.222
flew unprotected
through murderous enemy fire

35:41.305 --> 35:42.765
to press home the attack.

35:44.267 --> 35:47.186
They knew they were flying
to almost certain death, but they went.

35:49.188 --> 35:51.065
Only one planed survived.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.236
Do you know what courage that took, John?

35:56.487 --> 35:58.281
To go out and meet that fate?

35:59.824 --> 36:00.658
Yeah.

36:01.617 --> 36:04.287
Well, you know, I think about those things
on Veteran's Day.

36:05.705 --> 36:06.539
I do.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.293
Crullers.

36:12.712 --> 36:15.965
Boy... boy, you talk about
your massacres, huh?

36:16.591 --> 36:19.552
Bobby's gonna put that bum
in four different hospitals.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.138
Lieutenant, you got to come.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.806
(sobbing)

36:30.646 --> 36:31.898
I'm sorry. (clears throat)

36:32.231 --> 36:33.858
-(sniffles)
-Uh, Lieutenant...

36:35.276 --> 36:37.737
Look, I've been down this road.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.448
You got to put it behind you.
You got to forget about it.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.122
You have any idea
how many generations of Hunters

36:48.664 --> 36:51.500
have served king and country
on the field of combat?

36:52.793 --> 36:53.628
All--

36:54.503 --> 36:56.881
all performed with dignity and honor.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.299
Lieutenant...

37:00.801 --> 37:02.845
A million years ago, you got pinched

37:02.929 --> 37:06.057
to run a few bucks
for a couple of lowlife flatfoots.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.644
It ain't exactly like
selling the H bomb to the Russians.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.188
I have to take a shower.

37:15.816 --> 37:18.069
Yeah, yeah, hey, okay.
Hey, you do that, huh?

37:18.152 --> 37:21.030
It'll give you a new perspective,
and then we can go to the fight.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.157
-I'm not going.
-(shower running)

37:24.116 --> 37:24.951
Okay.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.370
What are you gonna do?

37:30.831 --> 37:31.749
(exhales)

37:42.093 --> 37:43.970
DARYL ANN:
You get enough to eat, Bobby Hill?

37:44.053 --> 37:47.181
-Yeah.
-Real good, Daryl Ann.

37:47.723 --> 37:49.642
Well, it's a good thing
you don't have a weight limit to make.

37:49.725 --> 37:51.519
I had a girlfriend
who dated a bantamweight.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.187
Little tiny, itty-bitty guy.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.897
Always sticking his finger
down his throat.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.649
Daryl Ann. Daryl Ann.

37:56.732 --> 37:59.151
Do you think you
could put a cork in it, please?

37:59.610 --> 38:01.237
Well, I was just
trying to help Bobby relax.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.405
Try silence.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.032
Well, who died and made him the pope?

38:06.284 --> 38:07.451
Keep talking, baby.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.288
Have some gum.

38:12.623 --> 38:14.417
Here, give me one, too.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.461
-Thirty seconds, Renko.
-ANDY: Thirty seconds.

38:18.379 --> 38:22.174
Bobby Hill, you're gonna
kick this guy's butt.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.637
ANNOUNCER: In the middleweight division,
a first round elimination bout.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.389
In the red corner,

38:28.764 --> 38:31.767
weighing in at 161 and one half pounds...

38:31.851 --> 38:34.395
-Cutting it close, aren't you?
-(chuckles) I made it, didn't I?

38:34.478 --> 38:36.814
Al "The Enforcer" Simmons.

38:36.897 --> 38:38.566
(cheers, boos)

38:45.489 --> 38:47.158
I hope you brought your money, Leo.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.826
You bet on this, Schnitz?

38:51.620 --> 38:52.455
Hey!

38:52.663 --> 38:54.206
In the blue corner,

38:54.790 --> 38:57.585
at 163 pounds,

38:57.668 --> 38:58.919
Representing Hill Street,

38:59.462 --> 39:01.255
Bobby "Blueberry" Hill.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.174
(honks horn)

39:07.928 --> 39:09.805
If you're told to break, you break clean.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.434
-Blueberry Hill?
-Yeah, Fats Domino was a real heavyweight.

39:13.893 --> 39:16.687
In the event of a knockdown,
you go to the furthest neutral corner.

39:17.438 --> 39:18.898
-Come on, Bobby!
-Come on!

39:19.732 --> 39:21.192
All right, fellas, let's shake hands.

39:21.275 --> 39:22.943
Let's have a clean fight
and no one gets hurt.

39:23.736 --> 39:25.237
Three rounds of boxing.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.865
The guy's a real chump, Bobby.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.117
He couldn't hit the ground
falling out of a tree.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.456
-Bobby's dead.
-Simmons will kill him.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.540
(exhales)

39:36.624 --> 39:39.502
Move, pace yourself.
We'll take the decision.

39:39.585 --> 39:42.213
-(crowd chanting)
-Thirty seconds, Renko. That's max.

39:43.589 --> 39:44.548
Whatever's right.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.635
(crowd chanting) Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

39:52.181 --> 39:53.265
(bell rings)

40:04.735 --> 40:05.778
-Get up!
-One...

40:05.861 --> 40:07.905
-Stay down.
-...two,

40:07.988 --> 40:09.907
-three...
-Get up!

40:09.990 --> 40:11.492
-Bobby, get up.
-Stay down.

40:11.575 --> 40:13.994
-Get up. Get up!
-Stay down.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.581
-...seven, eight, nine...
-Get up.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.419
You okay? You okay? What's your name?

40:21.502 --> 40:22.461
-Hill.
-Okay.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.423
Come on, Bobby! He's going!

40:25.506 --> 40:27.174
(horn honking)

40:29.176 --> 40:30.010
Break. Break.

40:35.683 --> 40:36.684
Get him, Bobby!

40:40.604 --> 40:42.022
Kill him, Bobby! Kill him!

40:44.024 --> 40:46.318
-(cheering)
-(horn honking)

40:54.535 --> 40:57.204
(chanting) Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

40:57.288 --> 40:58.789
(cheering)

40:59.582 --> 41:00.791
Come on, get in the corner.

41:04.336 --> 41:07.548
One, two, three,

41:07.631 --> 41:11.510
-four, five, six...
-(indistinct)

41:11.969 --> 41:16.599
...seven, eight, nine, ten.

41:16.682 --> 41:18.976
-He's out.
-(bell rings)

41:19.059 --> 41:21.520
(cheering)

41:31.530 --> 41:33.032
FAY: I thought for sure
he was gonna ask me

41:33.115 --> 41:35.993
to be the token female
on some token commission.

41:36.535 --> 41:39.997
But I got the genuine feeling
that he cares.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.917
-You know, he really listened to me.
-Ozzie's a good man.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.086
I think you'll be a valuable part
of his administration.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.255
You know, I think so, too, Henry.

41:49.757 --> 41:50.591
Thank you.

41:56.764 --> 41:57.598
To you, Fay.

42:00.226 --> 42:03.479
I don't know anyone
who deserves happiness more.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.696
Would it embarrass you
if I told you I love you?

42:13.906 --> 42:14.740
Of course not.

42:16.825 --> 42:19.954
I don't mean I love you,
I want to go to bed with you.

42:20.579 --> 42:21.622
I mean I love you.

42:22.957 --> 42:24.667
Not that I haven't thought about it.

42:24.750 --> 42:26.043
-About what?
-You know.

42:26.126 --> 42:28.796
Us, in the same room,

42:29.505 --> 42:30.798
without clothes.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.552
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to embarrass you.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.721
I-- I know,
that's nothing strong between us.

42:41.892 --> 42:42.726
Fay.

42:44.603 --> 42:45.437
What?

42:46.981 --> 42:47.982
You're beautiful.

42:49.650 --> 42:52.027
And I have thought about us
making love to each other.

42:54.446 --> 42:57.324
Now let me tell you
why that would be completely wrong.

42:58.033 --> 42:58.867
Why?

42:59.577 --> 43:01.662
Well, for one thing,
there's Frank to consider.

43:02.079 --> 43:05.874
Now, I know that he's remarried,
and you and I are single adults,

43:06.917 --> 43:08.002
but that's not the point.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.838
I mean,
you two have to work with each other.

43:11.338 --> 43:14.758
And besides,
you know when sex enters a relationship,

43:15.050 --> 43:19.597
uh, it gets all tense
and possessive and...

43:20.347 --> 43:21.181
(sighs)

43:21.849 --> 43:26.020
Henry, what you and I have
is-is so special.

43:26.103 --> 43:29.023
I would cut my wrists
before I'd do anything to jeopardize that.

43:32.568 --> 43:33.402
Maybe you're right.

43:35.613 --> 43:36.780
You're not angry, are you?

43:37.072 --> 43:37.906
Of course not.

43:38.949 --> 43:39.783
Why risk it?

43:41.452 --> 43:42.453
Onward and upward.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.471
Walk you to the door?

44:01.472 --> 44:02.681
Oh, no, that's okay.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.476
Thank you, Henry Goldblume.

44:06.810 --> 44:09.104
For dinner and for you and everything.

44:09.563 --> 44:11.315
You're welcome. Kiss the kids for me.

44:11.732 --> 44:12.566
I will.

44:13.192 --> 44:14.568
They're with my mother tonight.

44:16.987 --> 44:17.821
Good night.

44:44.264 --> 44:46.725
(moans) Henry, this is wrong.

44:46.809 --> 44:47.643
No, it's not.

44:56.568 --> 44:57.403
(exhales)

44:58.195 --> 45:01.115
Well, are we gonna do this double parked
or are you gonna come in?

45:11.834 --> 45:15.629
(classical music playing)

45:45.367 --> 45:46.660
Something esprit de corps.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.456
A quick, extemporaneous haiku.

45:56.920 --> 46:01.133
Wind, shudders dark,

46:01.341 --> 46:04.970
leaves of fortune...

46:08.056 --> 46:09.099
tree,

46:10.684 --> 46:12.019
you stand...

46:14.104 --> 46:17.441
testament of my...

46:20.110 --> 46:21.153
opacity.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.268
(gun cocks)

47:42.192 --> 47:43.777
Clean application of pressure.

47:44.111 --> 47:46.697
Function of a simple algebraic equation.

47:51.577 --> 47:52.786
Be a man about it.

48:00.586 --> 48:01.545
I love you, Mom.

48:04.464 --> 48:05.674
(gunshot)

48:12.097 --> 48:15.100
(closing theme playing)
