WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.369
&gt;&gt;<i> TRUE JACKSON VP</i>

00:02.435 --> 00:03.169
WAS FILMED IN FRONT

00:03.236 --> 00:05.438
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.639
&gt;&gt; BEFORE I SAY THE MAGIC WORDS,

00:06.706 --> 00:08.174
I'M REQUIRED BY LAW TO ASK

00:08.241 --> 00:09.242
IF ANYBODY HERE IS ALLERGIC

00:09.309 --> 00:11.544
TO DEADLY SNAKE VENOM.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.547
CAN I SEE A SHOW OF HANDS?

00:14.614 --> 00:15.515
&gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HAVE A REAL SNAKE

00:15.582 --> 00:16.716
IN THERE, RIGHT?

00:16.783 --> 00:17.884
&gt;&gt; I THINK I HEARD HISSING.

00:17.951 --> 00:18.651
IT'S EITHER A SNAKE

00:18.718 --> 00:20.553
OR SOMEONE'S FRYING BACON.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.856
&gt;&gt; ABRACADABRA, ALAN KAZAM...

00:22.922 --> 00:23.923
&gt;&gt; WAIT.

00:23.990 --> 00:26.292
DID YOU JUST SAY ALAN KAZAM?

00:26.359 --> 00:28.161
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE'S MY DAD'S LAWYER.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.463
HE TAUGHT ME THIS TRICK.

00:30.530 --> 00:34.934
AND...

00:35.001 --> 00:37.203
&gt;&gt; LUCY? WHERE ARE YOU, GIRL?

00:37.270 --> 00:38.438
[GIRLS SCREAM]

00:38.505 --> 00:39.506
HEY, CAN YOU KEEP IT DOWN

00:39.572 --> 00:40.073
OUT THERE?

00:40.140 --> 00:40.774
I'M TRYING TO PERFORM

00:40.840 --> 00:43.443
SOME MAGIC.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.612
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

00:45.678 --> 00:49.816
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?

00:49.883 --> 00:50.984
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S GOING ON, MISS PARK?

00:51.050 --> 00:51.985
YOU SEEM HAPPY.

00:52.051 --> 00:52.719
&gt;&gt; I'VE JUST COME FROM

00:52.786 --> 00:54.120
THE BIG SCHOOL BUDGET MEETING.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.388
PRINCIPAL RUCKMAN INFORMED US

00:55.455 --> 00:56.322
THAT BECAUSE OF CUTBACKS,

00:56.389 --> 00:57.157
HE'S ELIMINATING

00:57.223 --> 00:58.558
THE DESIGN PROGRAM.

00:58.625 --> 00:59.726
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S TERRIBLE.

00:59.793 --> 01:00.894
&gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY?

01:00.960 --> 01:01.628
&gt;&gt; HE APPROVED FUNDING

01:01.694 --> 01:02.595
FOR A CAPPUCCINO MACHINE

01:02.662 --> 01:06.199
IN THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE.

01:06.266 --> 01:09.669
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.537
&gt;&gt; BUT DESIGN IS WHERE

01:10.603 --> 01:11.871
I LEARNED HOW TO SEW.

01:11.938 --> 01:13.273
WE'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

01:13.339 --> 01:15.008
&gt;&gt; TRUE, YOU'RE A STUDENT

01:15.074 --> 01:16.242
AND THIS IS YOUR SCHOOL.

01:16.309 --> 01:16.843
IF THERE IS SOMETHING

01:16.910 --> 01:18.478
YOU FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT,

01:18.545 --> 01:19.446
IT DOESN'T MATTER,

01:19.512 --> 01:21.247
YOU'RE COMPLETELY POWERLESS.

01:21.314 --> 01:22.415
&gt;&gt; BUT THERE HAS TO BE A WAY

01:22.482 --> 01:23.249
TO MAKE PRINCIPAL RUCKMAN

01:23.316 --> 01:24.050
CHANGE HIS MIND.

01:24.117 --> 01:24.884
&gt;&gt; OH, INDEED THERE IS.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.286
JUST COME UP WITH THE $6,000

01:26.352 --> 01:27.287
TO CLOSE THE BUDGET GAP.

01:27.353 --> 01:27.921
NOW, THIS NEEDS JUST

01:27.987 --> 01:29.756
A SPRINKLE OF SHAVED CHOCOLATE.

01:29.823 --> 01:30.924
EVERYBODY STARE STRAIGHT AHEAD

01:30.990 --> 01:37.597
UNTIL I GET BACK.

01:37.664 --> 01:38.798
&gt;&gt; I CAN FIX THIS.

01:38.865 --> 01:39.432
&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE YOU

01:39.499 --> 01:40.633
GONNA GET $6,000?

01:40.700 --> 01:44.304
&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY. I'VE GOT A PLAN.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.705
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE.

01:45.772 --> 01:46.873
I HAVE A VERY EXCITING PROJECT

01:46.940 --> 01:49.709
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

01:49.776 --> 01:50.877
KOPELMAN,

01:50.944 --> 01:51.744
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:51.811 --> 01:53.046
THIS IS A KIDS ONLY MEETING,

01:53.112 --> 01:53.646
COULD YOU GIVE US,

01:53.713 --> 01:57.383
LIKE, A HALF AN HOUR?

01:57.450 --> 01:58.384
&gt;&gt; HE'S CONFUSED, TRUE.

01:58.451 --> 01:59.118
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY

01:59.185 --> 01:59.719
TELLING HIM IN A WAY

01:59.786 --> 02:01.654
HE'LL ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND.

02:01.721 --> 02:04.791
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, KOPELMAN,

02:04.858 --> 02:11.331
OUT!

02:11.397 --> 02:12.265
THE ISSUE AT HAND IS

02:12.332 --> 02:13.933
WHAT KIND OF SHOW CAN WE PUT ON

02:14.000 --> 02:16.102
TO RAISE $6,000?

02:16.169 --> 02:17.604
&gt;&gt; SIMPLE. I'LL DO A MAGIC SHOW.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.239
NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS.

02:19.305 --> 02:19.973
&gt;&gt; THIS IS THE ONLY ORDER

02:20.039 --> 02:20.607
OF BUSINESS

02:20.673 --> 02:21.674
AND IT'S NOT RESOLVED YET.

02:21.741 --> 02:22.308
NO ONE'S GONNA PAY

02:22.375 --> 02:24.010
TO WATCH YOU DO MAGIC TRICKS.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.545
&gt;&gt; OH, REALLY?

02:25.612 --> 02:28.848
WHAT IF I DID THIS?

02:28.915 --> 02:29.582
IMAGINE HOW COOL

02:29.649 --> 02:30.316
IT WOULD'VE BEEN IF A BIRD

02:30.383 --> 02:32.485
JUST SHOT OUT OF MY SLEEVE.

02:32.552 --> 02:33.520
&gt;&gt; IS THAT YOUR ACTUAL ACT

02:33.586 --> 02:34.120
WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT

02:34.187 --> 02:34.721
HOW COOL SOMETHING

02:34.787 --> 02:36.589
WOULD HAVE BEEN?

02:36.656 --> 02:38.491
&gt;&gt; MORE OR LESS.

02:38.558 --> 02:39.659
FINE, PLAN B.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.728
WE AUCTION OFF A DATE--WITH ME.

02:41.794 --> 02:42.962
THAT'LL GET YOU 5,800 BUCKS

02:43.029 --> 02:43.897
AND WE'LL JUST NEED TO COME UP

02:43.963 --> 02:46.733
WITH THE EXTRA 200.

02:46.799 --> 02:47.333
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE

02:47.400 --> 02:47.901
I'M SAYING THIS,

02:47.967 --> 02:49.202
BUT RYAN'S DATE IDEA

02:49.269 --> 02:50.169
IS THE ONE TO BEAT.

02:50.236 --> 02:50.703
&gt;&gt; OH, WAIT,

02:50.770 --> 02:51.404
WHAT ABOUT YOUR BAND, JIMMY?

02:51.471 --> 02:52.906

02:52.972 --> 02:53.840
&gt;&gt; NAH, WE BROKE UP.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.041
&gt;&gt; REALLY, WHY?

02:55.108 --> 02:55.708
&gt;&gt; WE COULD NEVER FIND

02:55.775 --> 02:56.676
THE TIME TO REHEARSE.

02:56.743 --> 02:57.844
WHAT WITH MY SCHEDULE AT WORK

02:57.911 --> 02:58.945
PLUS THE GUYS IN THE BAND

02:59.012 --> 02:59.712
BUSY PLAYING SHOWS

02:59.779 --> 03:01.481
WITH ANOTHER DRUMMER.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.182
&gt;&gt; AW, DUDE, THAT'S ROUGH.

03:03.249 --> 03:03.783
IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD

03:03.850 --> 03:05.885
GETTING REPLACED.

03:05.952 --> 03:06.553
&gt;&gt; REPLACED?

03:06.619 --> 03:07.720
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:07.787 --> 03:08.721
&gt;&gt; JUST THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE

03:08.788 --> 03:09.556
YOUR BAND FIRED YOU

03:09.622 --> 03:12.525
AND HIRED ANOTHER DRUMMER.

03:12.592 --> 03:14.494
&gt;&gt; WHERE DO YOU GET THAT FROM?

03:14.561 --> 03:15.562
WHAT, JUST BECAUSE THEY PUT

03:15.628 --> 03:16.496
HIS NAME ON THE FRONT

03:16.563 --> 03:19.332
OF MY DRUM KIT?

03:19.399 --> 03:22.435
I GOTTA GO.

TO PUT ON THE FUNDRAISER, TRUE?

03:23.836 --> 03:24.270

03:34.347 --> 03:35.882
I FEEL LIKE I NEVER SEE YOU.

03:35.949 --> 03:36.950
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE SEEING ME NOW.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.318
&gt;&gt; THAT'S TRUE.

03:38.384 --> 03:39.619
&gt;&gt; OKAY, GOTTA GO.
