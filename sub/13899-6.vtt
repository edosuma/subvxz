[Mal] I've gotta be honest. That
was the best all night stakeout

00:10.050 --> 00:11.420
I've ever been at.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.470
I think I'm gonna give
Jake and Des their notice.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.140
Oh wow.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.720
I think we should keep Des.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.600
But I think we can definitely
let go of Jake.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.560
Oh...

00:22.060 --> 00:23.270
Mal.

00:23.310 --> 00:25.310

No, no. Look.

01:14.610 --> 01:16.660
Right. Patti.
Let me ask you a question.

01:16.700 --> 01:18.450

You and I, we didn't...?

01:19.740 --> 01:23.910
No. No. You don't remember?
I'm Sloan's aunt.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.830
You told me to come over.
We talked last night.

01:25.870 --> 01:27.250
Wait, wait, wait. Sloan.

01:27.290 --> 01:28.420
Yeah, the group home
said she's missing.

01:29.460 --> 01:30.670
You said you were gonna
find her.

01:30.710 --> 01:33.090

01:33.130 --> 01:34.760
No, no.
I was not drinking.

01:34.800 --> 01:36.590
I'm not here to judge.
I'm just looking for my niece.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.510
Did you find her?

01:41.390 --> 01:43.680
Look around.
Okay? You're safe here.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.430
Just tell me what happened.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.980
I did something bad.
I screwed up.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.980

What happened?

01:49.020 --> 01:51.150
Some people are mad.
And now they're coming after me.

Maybe Sloan was
looking at this.

about you?

09:27.520 --> 09:29.110
Thank God you're here Captain
Suit Face Man.

09:29.690 --> 09:30.770
Where's the girl?

09:30.820 --> 09:31.940
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:31.980 --> 09:32.940
I don't have time for this.

09:32.980 --> 09:34.440
And I'd rather
this not get ugly.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.030
You should have thought of that
before you got that face.

09:37.070 --> 09:39.120
You know,
I'm really not on today.

09:41.080 --> 09:41.990
[punch]

09:42.040 --> 09:42.540
Ugh!

09:43.830 --> 09:45.870
Let's see what you got
in your pockets here.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.420
Business Card.
Bruno Wright.

09:50.460 --> 09:51.500
[punch]

09:52.960 --> 09:53.880
Ohh.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.100
His name is Bruno Wright.

10:06.140 --> 10:07.560
I'm gonna text this to Rose.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.520
See if she can figure anything
out about it.

10:10.310 --> 10:10.480
Can we go then?

10:11.820 --> 10:14.610
No, no. I gotta follow up
with the phone number

10:14.650 --> 10:15.860
that I've been tracing.

10:15.900 --> 10:16.950
Okay. I'll wait here.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.170
Had a word with the
administration desk.

10:32.210 --> 10:33.750
Suggested Leon's cheques might
be fraudulent.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.220
Should keep him busy
for a while.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.430
See? You don't have to go
busting down doors like Jake.

10:41.470 --> 10:46.350
Wicked, old may. No, I didn't
mean old man-- like ancient.

10:47.060 --> 10:49.560
I meant, like, wise.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.480
Like, you should
have a beard or something.

10:54.980 --> 10:55.900
Come on.

10:55.940 --> 10:56.940
- Let's go.
- Okay.

11:04.910 --> 11:06.290
Look. Look.
Sloan's jacket.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.540
Ah, Mal?

11:21.640 --> 11:22.550
[Patti]
You find anything?

11:22.590 --> 11:22.930
Yeah.

11:24.430 --> 11:26.220
The phone number belongs to
a fella. He's an employee.

11:26.260 --> 11:27.520
His name is Warren Hedley.

11:27.560 --> 11:28.850
But he didn't come in
to work today.

11:28.890 --> 11:30.520
[ringing]

11:33.060 --> 11:34.440
Ah, Leslie.
What do you got?

11:34.480 --> 11:36.570
Yeah. We got a witness statement
saying they saw a girl

11:36.610 --> 11:39.570
matching the description of
Sloan at Gower and Cochrane.

11:39.610 --> 11:40.570
That was an hour ago.

11:40.610 --> 11:41.410
Gower and Cochrane.

11:42.070 --> 11:42.860
Is anyone with her?

11:42.910 --> 11:44.490
They didn't get a good look.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.950
Just saw her hop a fence at the
north east corner of Cochrane.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.160
Okay. Thanks.
And keep me posted. Alright.

11:52.460 --> 11:53.580
Phone book.

11:55.790 --> 11:59.420
Sloan, right? She tore that page
out of a phone book.

12:01.970 --> 12:03.050
So she was looking for
something.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.220
Hotels, hostels and B and B's.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.100
There's a Youth Hostel on
Cochrane Street near Gower.

12:12.140 --> 12:13.190
Come on.

12:13.230 --> 12:14.650
We can take my car.
I'll drive.

12:15.770 --> 12:18.360
Ah, ah.
You're in no shape to drive.

12:19.820 --> 12:20.820
Well, I'm not sure
which one of you said that.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.160
That kind of tells me that
you're probably right.

12:30.660 --> 12:32.120
You know, you didn't have
to steal the registry.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.580
You could have just asked
at the front desk.

12:35.460 --> 12:36.880
Sloan's not in here.

12:36.920 --> 12:37.840
Can I see?

12:41.130 --> 12:42.050
Wait a minute.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.850
Ellen Daniels.
That's Sloan's mother.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.430
Right.
I didn't even see that.

12:52.310 --> 12:54.850
So she's here.
Room 112.

12:55.850 --> 12:56.980
[knocking]

12:57.020 --> 12:57.900
Sloan?

12:59.650 --> 13:00.940
Sloan!

13:00.980 --> 13:01.900
Ow!

13:01.940 --> 13:02.990
What is wrong with you?

13:03.030 --> 13:04.280
Easy.

13:04.320 --> 13:04.820
First things first, alright?

13:06.160 --> 13:07.950
How big is this mess
that you're tangled up in?

13:07.990 --> 13:09.450
You don't remember any of this?

13:12.450 --> 13:14.960
Oh. What is missus doing here?

13:16.120 --> 13:17.080
Let me guess.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.960
You don't got an Aunt Patti,
do you?

13:23.630 --> 13:25.260
That's not bad
for a cloudy mind.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.680
Oh, and that actually
timed out perfectly.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.640
You're about to get really
sleepy, Jake.

13:30.390 --> 13:31.760
What did you do to him?

13:31.810 --> 13:34.560
Just some time release drugs.
Now give me the phone.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.270
What phone?

13:35.850 --> 13:37.270
Give it to me.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.770
Otherwise your day is
about to get a whole lot worse.

13:40.480 --> 13:41.610
Is he gonna be okay?

13:41.650 --> 13:43.650
Phone. Now.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.160
Don't let me see you again.

13:55.540 --> 13:56.540
Are you okay?

13:59.790 --> 14:00.960
I think she drugged me.

14:01.550 --> 14:02.460
You think?

14:02.500 --> 14:03.840
[ringing]

14:05.630 --> 14:06.550
Yeah?

14:06.590 --> 14:07.680
We got something.

14:07.720 --> 14:11.050
[bang]

14:11.100 --> 14:12.560
We got Sloan, Jake.
We got her!

14:12.600 --> 14:15.100
That's impossible. Sloan's
standing right in front of me.

14:15.140 --> 14:17.440
Or at least I think she is.
You are, right?

14:19.310 --> 14:20.520
If you have Sloan,

14:20.560 --> 14:22.610
then who is this?

14:22.650 --> 14:24.690
[bang]

14:37.540 --> 14:40.040
It's just a strange man
tied to a toilet.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.380
I think we got our
wires crossed.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.260
His name is Warren Hedley,

14:48.300 --> 14:49.390
Warren Hedley.

14:50.590 --> 14:51.680
I think I was following him
last night.

14:52.180 --> 14:53.430
That's so weird.

14:53.470 --> 14:55.180
Okay, well, I'll
call you when I find out more.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.350
You're okay now, sir.

14:58.390 --> 14:59.270
Thanks.

15:05.030 --> 15:05.940
Are you okay?

15:05.980 --> 15:06.940
I'm alright.

15:06.990 --> 15:07.900
Well.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.610
I don't know about that.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.160
[sighs]

15:22.290 --> 15:24.500
Do you have a drug problem you
need to discuss with an adult?

15:25.710 --> 15:27.130
God only knows what
she filled me with.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.680
Why did Patti want that phone
that you gave her?

15:32.220 --> 15:33.300
Promise you won't freak out?

15:34.010 --> 15:35.720
Okay. You promised.

15:42.270 --> 15:46.520
So. I kinda do this thing where
I swipe people's phones

15:46.570 --> 15:47.780
and sell them back to them.

15:47.820 --> 15:48.740
Another scam?

15:48.780 --> 15:49.780
I told you not to freak out.

15:49.820 --> 15:51.410
I didn't say that I wouldn't.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.160
Sloan.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.780
You are so much smarter--

15:55.830 --> 15:57.030
Oh my God.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.290
You already lectured me
on this yesterday.

15:59.330 --> 16:00.000
Same words even.

16:00.910 --> 16:02.330
You put me through hell. Okay?

16:02.370 --> 16:03.580
I got drugged a million times.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.040
All so some missus
could get some phone back?

16:06.090 --> 16:08.380
It wasn't even her phone
that she wanted.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.130
Plus--
I gave her a phone.

16:11.510 --> 16:13.680
Doesn't mean it was the one
she was looking for.

16:14.550 --> 16:15.850
I gave the real one to you.

16:19.220 --> 16:20.770
Where the hell did I put it?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.020
Um. Well...

16:23.060 --> 16:24.360
Maybe I could help with that.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.480
Hey. That's the guy I lifted
the phone off of.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.860
That's Warren Headly.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.940
He is a systems analyst
with Elite Security Group.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.320
What's the connection?

16:32.360 --> 16:34.490
It turns out that Warren shares
an apartment lease

16:34.530 --> 16:35.740
with
Patti Middlebrooks.

16:35.780 --> 16:37.700
Oh, so they're a couple.
That's just great.

16:37.740 --> 16:40.160
It sounds like Warren was being
held captive in a boarding house

16:40.200 --> 16:41.830
by this guy-- Leon Zimmerman,

16:41.870 --> 16:43.790
who Mal and Des
are surveilling right now.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.500
So Leon's after the phone too.

16:45.540 --> 16:48.090
Yeah. Now this Leon guy has
a history of violent crime.

16:48.130 --> 16:49.340
He's not a--

16:49.380 --> 16:51.590
thinking man's thug.
He's more of a hired gun.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.970
So I'm guessing we think that's
the guy who hired him.

16:54.010 --> 16:55.130
Bruno Wright.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.180
Now this guy owns a small
shipping company.

16:57.220 --> 16:59.890
But it appears to be a front for
underground antique dealing.

16:59.930 --> 17:00.890
He was there with Leon.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.850
So why did he want the phone.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.150
And why...

17:06.520 --> 17:09.190
Why are you moving?

17:09.230 --> 17:10.150
Oh jeez.

17:10.190 --> 17:10.730
Jake!

17:11.490 --> 17:12.530
[Des] You okay?

17:12.570 --> 17:13.530
[Mal] I'm fine.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.360
Can you get
one of your hands free?

17:16.410 --> 17:18.620
I don't know.
He tired us pretty tight.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.490
But don't worry.
I still think that your way

17:20.540 --> 17:21.500
works better than Jake's
half the time.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.540
Oh man.
If Tinny could see us now, wha?

17:24.580 --> 17:25.370
Tinny?

17:25.420 --> 17:26.920
Often times I wonder

17:26.960 --> 17:29.090
what she would be thinking in
certain situations. Like...

17:30.670 --> 17:33.210
Would she be thinking: Was that
the best thing I ever did?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.670
Or will I be regretting it

17:34.720 --> 17:37.590
for the rest of my days
upon this planet, kind of thing.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.850
Well, if we don't
get out of here,

17:38.890 --> 17:40.720
I'd say she'd be
a tad regretful. Wouldn't you?

17:40.760 --> 17:41.390
Yeah. That is so Tinny.

17:43.060 --> 17:45.890
I think the rope's cut of the
circulation to your brain, son.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.150
So please, try to get free.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.730
No, Bruno. Bruno!

17:50.770 --> 17:52.190
You're not listening.

17:53.230 --> 17:54.570
I have no idea
where Warren went.

17:55.820 --> 17:57.070
And if Patti wants
the rest of that money,

17:57.110 --> 17:59.070
she's gonna have to
get us the code, yeah?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.240
No.

18:02.290 --> 18:02.540
No...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.330
If you want 'em dead, you're
gonna have to pay double.

18:11.090 --> 18:11.960
Ah!

18:12.750 --> 18:14.050
Well, thank goodness.

18:14.090 --> 18:15.470
Oh good. Because I wasn't gonna
move you again.

18:15.880 --> 18:16.220
Sorry.

18:17.340 --> 18:18.590
My head feels
like I've been playing a

18:18.630 --> 18:20.970
marathon of Gauntlet
at the arcade.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.100
Did you find the phone?

18:23.140 --> 18:25.310
For the last time,
you had it.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.850
When did you give it to me?

18:29.310 --> 18:32.320
Okay, goldfish brain.
You dropped me off at the house.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.440
And you took the phone
from me then.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.650
And then you got the

18:34.690 --> 18:36.400
number from Leslie
belonging to the phone.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.280
Which led me to Warren's
security company.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.280
And then I left a rambling
voicemail on Leslie's phone.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.700
Dude. Rookie move.
Don't get drugged and dial.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.500
Okay, but if you headed

18:46.540 --> 18:48.160
right to the security company

18:48.210 --> 18:50.210
after dropping Sloan
off at the house-

18:50.250 --> 18:52.630
Which means that I didn't have
time to stash it anywhere.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.550
Come on.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.430
[Leon] Now we're talking.
Look, finally Bruno,

19:02.470 --> 19:03.640
that's all I've been asking.

19:03.680 --> 19:04.680
Now we have an understanding.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.640
Now I'll get my stuff
and do the deed.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.310
You two,

19:12.360 --> 19:13.650
just relax.

19:13.690 --> 19:14.400
I'll be right back.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.900
What stuff do you think
he's getting?

19:16.940 --> 19:18.490
I'm not waiting to find out.
We have to get free.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.740
The knife. The knife.
It's in my back pocket.

19:22.490 --> 19:23.740
Good man. Good man, Des.

19:24.450 --> 19:27.500
Heh, heh, heh, heh!

19:27.540 --> 19:29.920
I'm sorry.
I have a ticklish tailbone.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.010
So. We've been driving around
for a while now.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.430
Wanna tell me what's
going on?

19:43.470 --> 19:45.100
Okay, look. I was drugged,
alright? I'm just--

19:45.140 --> 19:46.560
trying to get my head together.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.350
Okay. But we kinda need to find
that phone pronto.

19:52.690 --> 19:53.980
You're allowed to be scared,
okay?

19:54.020 --> 19:55.110
You don't need to go around

19:55.150 --> 19:56.820
acting so tough all the time.

19:56.860 --> 19:58.070
What?
What are you laughing about?

19:58.110 --> 19:59.780
You already said
this exact same thing--

19:59.820 --> 20:02.320
yesterday.
Just awesome.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.450
This is the place
I used to hide things

20:05.490 --> 20:06.540
when I didn't want my
father to find 'em.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.040
Like what?

20:10.660 --> 20:11.960
Impressive.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.040
What can I say?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.000
[ringing]

20:14.040 --> 20:15.170
Did the phone just--?

20:15.210 --> 20:17.420
No. No.
It's mine.

20:17.460 --> 20:18.670
[ringing]

20:19.550 --> 20:21.970
Hi. Leslie. I--

20:22.720 --> 20:23.260
I found Sloan.

20:24.760 --> 20:28.140
That's great. We got people
looking into Bruno Wright.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.180
If he surfaces,
we'll get him.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.730
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

20:31.770 --> 20:33.520
You...
You got a sec?

20:38.110 --> 20:40.230
If this is about the voice mail
I left you last night--

20:40.280 --> 20:41.650
I know,
I shouldn't be pressuring you.

20:42.610 --> 20:43.910
This whole thing--
I'm sorry.

20:43.950 --> 20:44.570
Unless, of course,

20:45.990 --> 20:47.780
it makes you feel like you wanna
do stuff with me.

20:47.830 --> 20:48.870
Then, I'm not sorry.

20:49.620 --> 20:51.500
You're a good guy, Jake.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.290
That doesn't sound good.

20:53.330 --> 20:54.210
[beeping]

20:57.130 --> 20:59.750
I'll swing by tonight.
We'll talk later.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.420
Talking is also a flag.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.010
But I'll take it,
if it means I get to see you.

21:03.050 --> 21:03.930
Alright.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.600
Callum?
One second.

21:08.970 --> 21:11.310
After your call, can you
call off the APB on Sloan?

21:11.350 --> 21:12.350
Of course,
Sergeant Bennett.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.560
Almost got it.

21:14.600 --> 21:15.730
Okay, I just want to say,

21:15.770 --> 21:17.310
that the closer
the blade gets

21:17.360 --> 21:17.940
to my wrist,

21:18.900 --> 21:21.110
the more I trust you.
Okay?

21:21.150 --> 21:22.650
And depending on
the size of the cut,

21:22.690 --> 21:23.950
the average person
can bleed out in seconds.

21:23.990 --> 21:25.110
No pressure.
I'm just saying.

21:25.150 --> 21:27.070
Des. Please.
Be quiet.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.910
[buzzing]

21:28.950 --> 21:30.740
I'm sorry. That's not my fault.
That's been going off all day.

21:30.790 --> 21:31.950
Please don't lose your
concentration.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.660
Don't worry.
I'm pretty good with a knife.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.580
I used to cut out tongues
as a young fella.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.120
I'm sorry. I'll be quiet.
I'll be quiet.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.920
Cod tongues, Des.
Please. Be still.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.510
[Leon] Fine. I'll go
take of them now.

21:42.550 --> 21:43.260
Mal, I think we're out of time.

21:44.510 --> 21:46.470
Des. You haven't been
picking up all day.

21:47.220 --> 21:47.470
Is everything all right?

21:48.850 --> 21:52.720
Just-- call me back, okay?
I'm worried about you.

21:54.730 --> 21:55.770
[Mal]
Hey.

21:55.810 --> 21:56.850
[crack]

22:03.280 --> 22:07.320
Oh, Ah. Ouch. I've done that
before to myself man. It smarts.

22:07.950 --> 22:08.700
[Mal]
Leon.

22:09.240 --> 22:09.740
I hate guns.

22:09.780 --> 22:11.330
Always have.

22:11.370 --> 22:15.370
But tell me what's going on. And
what it has to do with Sloan.

22:18.790 --> 22:19.540
[Jake] So this is the
phone they're after.

22:19.920 --> 22:19.960
Anything?

22:21.550 --> 22:24.670
Seventeen missed calls from
a blocked caller. One app.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.180
The rest of the phone is empty.

22:27.220 --> 22:27.930
Wait.
What's this code for?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.550
It looks like it's
a pass code generator.

22:30.590 --> 22:33.680
You need it to gain access
to secure areas.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.770
Now, typically, they're supposed
to reset themselves.

22:36.810 --> 22:38.640
And by the looks of this one,
it's every thirty five minutes.

22:38.690 --> 22:39.980
Well, what's the pass code for?

22:40.020 --> 22:40.060
I don't know.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.400
I'll text it to Rose and see
if she can figure it out.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.820
[ringing]

22:48.910 --> 22:49.820
Jiffy Cabs.

22:49.860 --> 22:51.160
What?
Who is this?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.120
Who's this?

22:52.160 --> 22:53.490
You're answering my phone.

22:53.530 --> 22:56.200
Oh. So this must be Warren.
Do me a favor.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.960
Put Patti, or whatever
her name is on the phone.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.790
I wanna thank her for the for
the whole bender she sent me on.

22:59.830 --> 23:01.420
We just want the phone back.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.550
Well, if you can assure me that
Sloan is gonna be safe then---

23:04.130 --> 23:05.090
[tires squeal]

23:11.300 --> 23:12.470
I'm gonna enjoy this.

23:15.890 --> 23:16.810
[punch]

23:16.850 --> 23:17.730
Arrgh!

23:18.310 --> 23:19.480
Ow! My ear!

23:19.520 --> 23:20.520
Sloan. What are you doing?

23:20.560 --> 23:21.560
- Helping.
- Argh!

23:21.980 --> 23:22.900
Ughh.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.480
That's for the nose, Doyle.

23:35.540 --> 23:36.410
Get in.

23:52.130 --> 23:53.350
Bruno's still got the phone.

23:54.100 --> 23:54.390
If we don't get it back,

23:55.470 --> 23:56.520
they're gonna keep
coming after you.

23:57.430 --> 23:59.100
God only knows what it accesses.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.150
Are you crazy?

24:06.610 --> 24:08.280
Just keep 'er steady, will ya?

24:08.320 --> 24:09.400
Yeah, I got it.

24:15.910 --> 24:17.950
Whoa. Are you serious?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.120
Sorry. I gotta make a call.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.210
Sloan!

24:25.880 --> 24:26.960
What did you do to him?

24:27.000 --> 24:28.170
Just some time release drugs.

24:56.620 --> 24:57.780
[Rose] Still no answer
from Jake or Sloan.

24:59.200 --> 25:01.330
I'm getting worried, Mal.
The condition Jake was in.

25:01.370 --> 25:01.790
Leon here isn't talking.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.120
Okay. Well, all of this
has to do with some phone

25:05.170 --> 25:06.290
with a code on it.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.000
See if you can get anything
out of him.

25:08.130 --> 25:09.250
Well, there is one thing
I wanted to try.

25:10.170 --> 25:10.960
I'll let you know how it goes.

25:11.630 --> 25:12.550
Okay. Be safe Hon.

25:12.590 --> 25:13.470
Will do.

25:19.100 --> 25:19.720
Oh yeah. This is good.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.020
This whole tough guy routine
you guys got going on here.

25:24.060 --> 25:26.190
[Mal] How are those knots,
Des? Good and tight?

25:26.230 --> 25:28.610
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I used a queen's
bow instead of a knot.

25:28.650 --> 25:30.070
You know it looks a bit better.

25:30.110 --> 25:31.940
Because Mal likes to take pics
of the body afterwards.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.150
So Leon. What's all this
about a code on a phone.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.910
You guys really expect me to
believe you're gonna drag me.

25:39.700 --> 25:41.700
Des.
Get in the truck.

25:41.740 --> 25:42.870
With pleasure.

25:48.330 --> 25:51.090
Not buying it.
I take one look at you guys.

25:51.130 --> 25:52.670
And I know this isn't
your style.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.970
Whoa! Hold on!
Wait wait wait! Hold on here!

25:55.010 --> 25:56.430
Maybe we should put this thing
in reverse.

25:56.470 --> 25:57.390
Des.

25:57.430 --> 25:58.680
Try reverse.

25:58.720 --> 25:59.550
He's not a great driver.

26:00.430 --> 26:01.720
Des.
It's "R", remember?

26:01.760 --> 26:04.230
Alright!
Stop the truck!

26:04.270 --> 26:05.810
The code on the phone.

26:07.730 --> 26:12.730
Warren.
He stole the code for us.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.240
Snuck it on to his work phone.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.610
But the girl pick-pocketed him.

26:15.650 --> 26:17.110
So we took Warren

26:17.150 --> 26:19.910
and told Patti that she had to
get the phone back for us.

26:19.950 --> 26:21.620
Still not telling us
what this code's for.

26:21.660 --> 26:22.620
I don't know.

26:23.620 --> 26:24.620
Des!

26:24.660 --> 26:25.250
Alright!

26:26.460 --> 26:30.540
Bruno-- said it was a key.
Or something.

26:31.340 --> 26:31.840
I don't know what for.

26:33.380 --> 26:38.930
Just said it was highly
valuable and worth killing for.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.890
And where's this thing
being held?

26:40.930 --> 26:42.550
There's an address
in my top pocket.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.520
It's a place where Warren
does security.

26:46.520 --> 26:48.690
I was supposed to head over
there after I took care of

26:48.730 --> 26:50.440
you and your
psycho friend.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.360
Alright Des.

26:57.900 --> 26:58.820
Des!

26:58.860 --> 27:00.410
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:00.450 --> 27:03.620
You said, "Alright".
I thought you meant, "Do it".

27:20.260 --> 27:22.300
Well. I'm here like you asked.
Now give me the phone.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.140
Where's Jake?

27:23.680 --> 27:24.970
Tell me now.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.470
You're in over your head.
Just give me the phone.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.430
Really.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.770
No. What are you doing?

27:28.810 --> 27:30.770
You have no idea
how important that is.

27:30.810 --> 27:34.310
Actually I do. Twenty minutes
and thirty eight seconds.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.730
That's how much time you have
until the pass code expires.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.450
You just destroyed the code,
you little idiot.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.910
I am the pass code.
I memorized it.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.540
You want it?
Bring me to Jake.

28:02.010 --> 28:03.390
You've been talking
in your sleep.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.300
Why are you here?

28:05.350 --> 28:08.100
I was trying to rescue you,
you stunned arse.

28:08.140 --> 28:09.890
And how's that working for you
so far?

28:11.350 --> 28:13.190
Please tell me that you brought
a few cops with you.

28:13.230 --> 28:14.110
They wouldn't be much help.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.070
You want out of this.
You give me the code.

28:18.610 --> 28:19.530
Now.

28:19.570 --> 28:20.650
[Sloan]
Okay! Okay!

28:21.490 --> 28:23.110
Zero five two...

28:24.910 --> 28:26.160
Okay, you
let me and Jake go,

28:26.200 --> 28:27.200
and I'll give you the rest of
the nine numbers.

28:28.330 --> 28:29.500
And you have
three and a half minutes.

28:33.370 --> 28:35.000
Okay. If you're lying,
you're dead.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.250
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

28:38.130 --> 28:39.550
Okay, wherever you wanna go.

28:39.590 --> 28:43.130
Just take me there.
And leave her here, okay.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.140
We're already here.
And you know what?

28:44.180 --> 28:45.720
You're getting us out.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.310
That door's a little tricky, but
you should be able to pick it.

28:48.350 --> 28:49.390
You stay in touch.

28:49.430 --> 28:50.560
Once you're inside that door,

28:50.600 --> 28:51.810
you have fifteen seconds

28:51.850 --> 28:53.140
to use this key
to disarm the alarm system.

28:53.190 --> 28:53.230
It'll be next to a red door.

28:54.980 --> 29:00.320
Buddy. I've been drugged, like,
for the last... eighteen hours.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.700
I really don't think
I'm the best fella for the job.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.610
[Warren]
Doyle, you have three minutes.

29:05.660 --> 29:06.910
Or I'm gonna shoot this girl.

29:06.950 --> 29:07.830
He will.

29:09.450 --> 29:10.080
You'll be okay.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.750
You hurt her, and I swear
to God, I'll kill you.

29:28.890 --> 29:29.600
I'm telling you right now,

29:30.890 --> 29:32.060
I'm going to have a hard time
doing this lock.

29:33.140 --> 29:35.310
You don't have time.
Get in there.

29:42.900 --> 29:43.950
Oh no...

29:44.820 --> 29:46.030
Jake. Hurry up.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.240
Okay, you got company.

29:49.660 --> 29:50.540
Be careful.

29:53.750 --> 29:56.620
Excuse me sir. Do you know
how to get to the Inn

29:56.670 --> 29:58.830
of Olde from here?
I'm kind of lost.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.840
- No.
- Okay, thanks.

30:06.550 --> 30:08.010
Hey.

30:08.050 --> 30:10.010
For a minute there, I thought
you weren't gonna show up.

30:10.050 --> 30:11.850
Yeah, there was just a case
I had to check in on.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.020
What was so important
that it couldn't wait?

30:15.270 --> 30:16.480
I've been wanting to
tell you for a while,

30:16.520 --> 30:17.600
but you've been really busy.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.230
The Department of Defense
contacted me.

30:19.270 --> 30:20.820
They've offered to reassign me.

30:21.650 --> 30:22.650
Oh.

30:22.690 --> 30:25.150
It's a step up.
It's a nice raise.

30:25.740 --> 30:26.820
Fancy title.

30:27.490 --> 30:28.200
Congratulations.

30:29.530 --> 30:32.120
I guess that means you'll be
shipping off soon?

30:32.950 --> 30:34.370
Oh, you think I'm leaving?

30:35.700 --> 30:37.790
Well, isn't that what you came
here to tell me?

30:37.830 --> 30:38.830
No. The job's here.

30:38.870 --> 30:39.790
I can stay here.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.040
For how long?

30:41.670 --> 30:42.540
As long as I want.

30:42.590 --> 30:43.750
After everything that happened,

30:43.800 --> 30:47.180
I wanted to put this first--
Put you first.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.140
Is that a done deal?

30:50.010 --> 30:51.220
The job's mine if I want it.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.310
That's good news.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.390
Yeah, I could stay here.

30:56.270 --> 30:57.440
I can be close to you.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.440
If you want.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.440
[alarm sounds]

31:03.940 --> 31:06.360
[Warren] You got fifteen
seconds to disarm that alarm.

31:08.200 --> 31:08.320
Red door or red door.

31:09.410 --> 31:10.780
Bruno, b'y,
I'm half color blind.

31:10.820 --> 31:12.070
You gotta be more specific.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.700
It's the one--
Hey! What the--?

31:13.740 --> 31:14.660
[static]

31:14.700 --> 31:15.580
[alarm]

31:26.420 --> 31:27.380
[alarm stops]

31:29.930 --> 31:31.300
Alright.
You can come in now.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.720
Hello?

31:35.810 --> 31:38.690
[knocking]

31:43.270 --> 31:44.520
Bruno's taking a nap.

31:45.570 --> 31:46.650
Awesome.

31:52.820 --> 31:54.280
I'm so sorry,
Jake.

31:54.320 --> 31:56.240
No, you've got nothing
to be sorry about.

31:57.620 --> 31:58.500
What do you want?

31:59.330 --> 31:59.960
This.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.790
[Sloan]
What is it?

32:01.830 --> 32:03.330
It's an astrolabe.
It's centuries old.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.090
Used for telling time
and navigating.

32:05.130 --> 32:06.750
There's only a handful let on
the entire planet.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.420
And one's being restored right
behind that door.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.760
Must be worth
a couple of million.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.930
Mmm hmm. It is.
And you're gonna get it for us.

32:12.590 --> 32:13.470
Now.

32:14.100 --> 32:14.720
What if I don't?

32:14.760 --> 32:16.180
[click]

32:16.220 --> 32:19.220
Okay. Okay. Look. I'll get your
astro--whatever it is.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.770
Just-- You gotta let
Sloan leave right now.

32:21.810 --> 32:24.190
No. Sloan stays. She's the only
one who knows the pass code.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.110
Go on. Move it.

32:33.740 --> 32:36.740
Okay. I need her to come over
here to get the code.

32:41.620 --> 32:42.540
What is it?

32:43.830 --> 32:48.300
Zero five two nine,
zero six zero, four two

32:48.340 --> 32:49.380
one zero eight.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.800
[beeping]

32:51.470 --> 32:52.630
Some memory on ya.

32:52.670 --> 32:53.340
It's kinda like memorizing
credit cards.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.680
Alright, listen.
Before I do this--

32:55.720 --> 32:57.470
you gotta make sure
when you get the thing you want,

32:57.510 --> 32:59.140
we all walk outta
here alive, alright?

32:59.180 --> 33:00.100
Deal.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.520
[buzzing]

33:25.170 --> 33:27.000
[Jake] So, this is what
all the fuss is about.

33:27.590 --> 33:28.630
Hand it over.

33:28.670 --> 33:30.000
No.
You gotta give me Sloan first.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.590
Fine. We'll do the exchange at
the same time.

33:47.480 --> 33:48.400
[bang]

33:48.440 --> 33:49.320
[glass shatters]

33:53.440 --> 33:54.450
This is not good.

33:56.320 --> 33:56.570
Why is it not working?

33:57.620 --> 33:58.990
Jake,
I think the codes expired.

34:03.540 --> 34:04.210
[alarm sounds]

34:04.830 --> 34:05.790
Just--
Hang on.

34:07.750 --> 34:08.170
Okay.

34:09.420 --> 34:10.750
Just cover your mouth up
with that, alright.

34:12.170 --> 34:13.510
I'm gonna get us out of here.

34:14.590 --> 34:15.550
Somehow.

34:23.890 --> 34:24.980
That looked like Warren.

34:25.020 --> 34:25.440
Yeah, it must have been Patti
with him.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.400
Check inside for Jake and Sloan.
I'm gonna follow them.

34:36.070 --> 34:37.070
Oh my god.

34:39.070 --> 34:42.200
Jake? Jake?

34:45.250 --> 34:46.580
[muffled coughing]

34:46.620 --> 34:47.080
Jake?

34:47.790 --> 34:48.710
Knock. Knock. Knock.

34:48.750 --> 34:49.670
Jake!

34:49.710 --> 34:50.590
[knocking]

34:57.680 --> 34:58.840
Des!

34:58.880 --> 35:00.180
Jake. I'm outside the door.
What's the code?

35:00.220 --> 35:02.510
Okay, the code is no good,
alright? It's expired.

35:02.550 --> 35:04.140
So we need to find another way
out of here. Like...

35:05.310 --> 35:06.350
We gotta blow the door,
or something.

35:06.390 --> 35:07.640
I don't think so.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.190
This type of door,
it has electromagnetic locks

35:10.230 --> 35:11.440
and three thousand
pounds of pressure.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.190
The room is filling up
with some kind of gas,

35:13.230 --> 35:15.030
so we gotta get outta here soon.

35:15.070 --> 35:17.030
I don't know. If I had...
If I had some parts...

35:17.070 --> 35:18.570
Like a signal disruptor.

35:18.610 --> 35:20.570
Something like that we'd be able
to get around the password.

35:20.610 --> 35:22.620
Okay. Think.
We gotta do something.

35:22.660 --> 35:23.740
Ah, Sloan.

35:24.910 --> 35:25.830
Hold on.

35:26.790 --> 35:27.710
Sloan!

35:28.120 --> 35:29.000
Sloan!

35:32.420 --> 35:35.380
Des. We gotta get out.
Hurry.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.650
What's this guy thinking?

35:52.850 --> 35:54.270
Hey.
Get outta the way buddy.

35:54.310 --> 35:56.730
Sorry about that. I'm just
looking for some directions.

35:56.780 --> 35:57.780
No excuse.

35:58.990 --> 35:59.990
Hey!

36:02.740 --> 36:04.070
Damn it. You!

36:04.120 --> 36:06.700
Yeah it's me!
The guy who untied you.

36:06.740 --> 36:08.040
Who you thanked

36:08.080 --> 36:09.620
by trying to cave
his skull in with a showerhead.

36:10.750 --> 36:13.000
Listen.
I'm really sorry about that.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.170
Don't worry about it.

36:14.210 --> 36:15.170
Where's your girlfriend?

36:15.210 --> 36:16.090
She's right here--

36:18.550 --> 36:19.510
Patti!

36:20.470 --> 36:21.090
She's a keeper, that one.

36:22.300 --> 36:26.220
Sloan. Okay, Des.
We gotta get out of here!

36:26.260 --> 36:27.600
I'm trying. I'm trying.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.350
I just can't find any quick way
to open the vault.

36:29.390 --> 36:30.350
Any safe way, that is.

36:30.390 --> 36:32.100
What do you mean, safe?

36:33.440 --> 36:37.190
Okay. There is a way,
but it could kill you.

36:37.230 --> 36:38.860
Okay? It'll electrocute you,
if you make a wrong move.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.570
Des. Tell me what it is now.
It's an emergency, okay?

36:41.610 --> 36:42.030
Just tell me what to do.

36:42.490 --> 36:43.950
Okay. Okay.

36:43.990 --> 36:46.200
So next to the door, next
to the door, there should be a--

36:46.240 --> 36:47.740
like a red exit button. Okay?

36:47.780 --> 36:48.990
And there's a panel
connected to it.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.290
Okay?
Can you open it with something?

36:50.330 --> 36:53.580
Uh... Yeah.

36:55.500 --> 36:57.040
[bang]

36:57.090 --> 36:57.960
Okay. I got it.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.050
Now. You wanna cut the two wires

36:59.090 --> 37:00.380
that are connected
to the door. Okay?

37:00.420 --> 37:01.920
They should be large and red.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.760
They're all red, okay?
Or at least I think they are.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.090
I'm color blind, Des. Just--
What do I do?

37:06.140 --> 37:07.720
There's a bunch of wires.
I'm just gonna cut them all.

37:07.760 --> 37:08.720
No. No. No!

37:08.760 --> 37:09.770
No. Jake! Jake!

37:09.810 --> 37:10.810
Okay. What, then? What? What?

37:10.850 --> 37:11.850
Only wanna
cut the two wires

37:11.890 --> 37:13.100
that are
connected to the door, okay?

37:13.140 --> 37:15.770
The other wire
that's connected to the magnet

37:15.810 --> 37:17.440
is carrying fifty amps.
If you cut that--

37:17.480 --> 37:18.650
And what? I'll blow up.
I get it.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.530
What else have I gotta do?

37:22.860 --> 37:24.240
Just give me a minute.
Give me a minutes.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.200
[coughing]

37:25.240 --> 37:26.120
Jake!

37:57.560 --> 38:00.650
So. You're having a hard old
day, aren't you?

38:01.320 --> 38:02.320
Looking for these?

38:03.190 --> 38:04.280
You don't quit.
Do you?

38:07.700 --> 38:08.870
He's looking rough.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.640
There you are.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.730
I heard about everything
from Leslie. Are you okay?

38:34.770 --> 38:35.390
I was worried.

38:36.310 --> 38:37.480
Yeah. Yeah. It all worked out.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.310
Sloan's just talking to
Jake and Leslie.

38:40.940 --> 38:41.690
I know that.

38:42.480 --> 38:44.360
I meant-- Are you okay?

38:47.110 --> 38:48.070
Come here.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.120
What's up?

38:50.870 --> 38:51.990
I've been calling you.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.740
And you haven't been
returning my calls.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.660
I mean,
I know you're busy.

39:06.630 --> 39:07.130
Look.

39:08.180 --> 39:09.510
The reason
I didn't call you back--

39:09.550 --> 39:10.850
It wasn't because I was busy.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.100
I know why you were calling.

39:16.140 --> 39:17.100
You wanted to say that--

39:18.390 --> 39:19.890
You wanted to say that that kiss
was a mistake.

39:19.940 --> 39:23.570
And that you really liked me
as a friend. But --

39:34.120 --> 39:35.410
So this isn't a mistake?

39:38.250 --> 39:39.040
No Des.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.250
This is definitely
not a mistake.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.720
Alright Jake.
See you guys soon.

39:49.380 --> 39:52.930
I gotta say. Jake did good.
But don't tell him that.

39:53.800 --> 39:54.890
I won't.

39:54.930 --> 39:56.310
And that Sloan?
She's got a fire in her.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.640
No doubt about it.
But she's a good kid.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.640
Just needs some guidance.

40:00.690 --> 40:02.020
I couldn't agree more.

40:03.110 --> 40:03.480
What?

40:04.230 --> 40:05.900
Jake has some thoughts

40:05.940 --> 40:09.400
on how Sloan could get
that very guidance you speak of.

40:16.330 --> 40:17.740
Thinking about your future?

40:17.790 --> 40:19.160
Well, you never know.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.330
I could see myself as a cop.

40:21.210 --> 40:21.960
I gotta be honest with you.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.000
When I predict your future
relationship

40:25.040 --> 40:25.710
with law enforcement,

40:26.590 --> 40:27.880
I ain't seeing you as a cop.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.880
Another lecture?

40:30.920 --> 40:31.050
No more lectures.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.590
The time for talking's over.
In fact...

40:34.720 --> 40:36.390
I'm moving you in
with Dad right away.

40:36.430 --> 40:37.470
End of story. Full stop.

40:37.510 --> 40:39.270
You have no right to do that.

40:39.310 --> 40:40.770
Obviously you have a choice.

40:40.810 --> 40:42.640
But the way I see it,
you have two options.

40:42.690 --> 40:44.770
Option One:
You stay on your own.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.480
And you end up as some kind of
super villain

40:47.520 --> 40:49.610
criminal mastermind.
Or number two.

40:49.650 --> 40:52.610
You move in with us.
And you end up messed up.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.240
But in a more normal way.

40:56.450 --> 40:57.330
It's up to you.

40:58.410 --> 40:58.870
Fine. Whatever.

41:00.160 --> 41:03.370
I guess everybody needs
someone to look up.

41:04.540 --> 41:08.090
And as sad and pathetic
as this sounds--

41:09.000 --> 41:10.510
You might be as good as it gets.

41:17.890 --> 41:21.770
I will let you two
make out for a bit.

41:25.900 --> 41:26.480
I just want you to know.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.110
Everything I said in that voice
mail. I meant it.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.320
I love you.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.370
Callum is staying in St. John's.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.200
The Department of Defense
needs a Criminal investigator

41:42.250 --> 41:43.870
to work with the soldiers
here in town.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.130
He was my husband.

41:50.880 --> 41:51.840
Yeah. He was.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.390
I don't want to make
this any more difficult

41:57.430 --> 41:58.640
than it has to be.

42:00.180 --> 42:01.810
So if you feel like
this is something

42:01.850 --> 42:02.810
you really need to do--

42:03.230 --> 42:04.140
I do.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.780
We almost made it this time,
didn't we?

42:24.580 --> 42:26.000
We were this close.
