01:39.684 --> 01:40.851
No, it's nothing.

01:40.852 --> 01:42.351
Let's just try something.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.895
- OK.
- OK.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.815
Sorry.

01:46.816 --> 01:48.275
All right, come here.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.319
Oh.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.488
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:53.489 --> 01:54.616
OK.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.826
Should we just stop?

01:57.827 --> 01:59.495
No, I'm fine.

02:04.626 --> 02:08.794
- Do you want to just go down on me?
- No.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.423
Hello?

02:11.591 --> 02:14.468
All right.

02:14.469 --> 02:15.928
It's fine.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.557
The last time I had sex,

02:20.558 --> 02:22.059
it hurt.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.894
Hmm. It hurt where?

02:23.895 --> 02:25.730
Do you think that could
be an STD, I mean…

02:27.857 --> 02:28.983
How many sexual partners have
you had in the last year?

02:32.070 --> 02:33.529
More than five?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.075
More than ten?

02:38.534 --> 02:40.494
It's around there.

02:40.495 --> 02:42.245
Protected?

02:43.706 --> 02:46.041
Yeah, I mean, um…

02:46.042 --> 02:48.878
- It's OK.
- Yeah, if we can find… Sorry.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.713
OK.

02:51.714 --> 02:54.050
Any problems urinating?
Any bumps or lesions?

02:55.968 --> 03:00.055
OK. I was still on the question
part of the examination.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.516
Moving right along…

03:02.517 --> 03:05.811
It's actually, uh…
It's a bit, kinda, higher up.

03:05.812 --> 03:08.187
More in the, uh, the pube region.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.856
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.901
Tell me if it hurts anywhere.

03:13.069 --> 03:14.320
Yeah.

03:16.531 --> 03:18.448
- Hmm.
- What?

03:18.449 --> 03:20.492
Ah, it's really nothing,

03:20.493 --> 03:21.994
but just to be on the safe side,

03:22.495 --> 03:23.621
I'm gonna order an X-ray.

Hey, you always come
into Littleneck, right?

04:23.097 --> 04:25.557
It's the sandwich shop on Franklin?

04:25.558 --> 04:27.934
Sorry. Uh, Littleneck, right?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.896
Um… Yes.

04:30.897 --> 04:32.355
I work there.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.358
Oh, cool.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.320
You always get your sandwiches to go?

04:38.321 --> 04:40.572
- Yeah, my office is around the corner.
- Yeah.

04:40.573 --> 04:42.283
Yeah, no, I recognize your headphones,

04:44.244 --> 04:48.331
and you're very pretty.

04:49.457 --> 04:54.503
Ow.

04:54.504 --> 04:57.590
- I'm in the middle of a podcast.
- Do you not like compliments?

04:58.716 --> 05:00.383
We're strangers.

05:00.384 --> 05:01.511
Semi-strangers.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.970
I mean…

05:03.971 --> 05:05.889
I know your favorite meat is ham.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.934
- Are you a stalker?
- No, I'm Elliot.

05:09.685 --> 05:13.605
Hey.

05:13.606 --> 05:14.857
Hey.

05:17.777 --> 05:19.778
You know, um…

05:19.779 --> 05:22.072
This is a great example
of the dangers of podcasts.

05:22.073 --> 05:24.324
What?

05:24.325 --> 05:26.244
Well, no, don't get me wrong.
I'm sure you're learning tons,

05:26.245 --> 05:28.328
you know, listening
to Radiolab, or whatever.

05:28.329 --> 05:30.290
Broadening your horizons,
and all that, but, um…

05:32.166 --> 05:35.585
Now, you're missing so much
stuff right in front of you.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.796
You know, the, uh… The
New York City texture.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.506
New York City texture.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.758
- Yeah.
- Does that normally work for you?

05:41.759 --> 05:44.803
- Why? You think it's a line?
- I just think that…

05:44.804 --> 05:47.098
Tinder has made you forget
how to talk to girls in person.

05:47.849 --> 05:49.558
And now, you're suffering
due to no reception.

05:53.104 --> 05:55.647
Maybe.

05:55.648 --> 05:58.276
But last week, I met Roberto,
an underwater welder

05:58.277 --> 06:00.819
on the C train.

06:00.820 --> 06:03.322
Did you know underwater welding
is one of the world's most dangerous jobs?

06:03.323 --> 06:05.782
So, you're the texture in this case, then?

06:05.783 --> 06:08.535
The… ham-slicing waiter?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.288
That's condescending.

06:10.289 --> 06:13.039
I don't love my job either.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.251
Who said I don't love my job?

06:15.252 --> 06:17.295
- I… I just thought…
- Oh, I hate it.

06:17.296 --> 06:19.213
Actually, um…

06:19.214 --> 06:20.922
I'm building an app.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.507
Doesn't an app kind of…

06:22.508 --> 06:24.467
get in the way of all the… textures?

06:25.887 --> 06:28.222
OK, no, that's a valid point, but, um,

06:28.223 --> 06:29.891
once I explain it to you, your mind…

06:31.392 --> 06:36.147
is gonna be blown, I promise.

06:36.148 --> 06:38.523
- Are you not getting on?
- No. I'm the F.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.318
Guess I'll see you at Littleneck, then.

06:40.319 --> 06:43.362
What's your name? Also,
your phone number, too.

06:43.363 --> 06:44.655
That would be… That would be good.

06:45.781 --> 06:50.452
Mia.

06:50.453 --> 06:53.539
Yeah. We were gonna… transfer…

07:03.258 --> 07:04.384
Hey Cheryl.

07:05.385 --> 07:06.510
Hi.

07:09.097 --> 07:11.141
How's it going?

07:25.655 --> 07:30.160
Fine.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.923
Durst's apartmentwas
located 2 miles from where

07:44.924 --> 07:47.343
the dismembered headless torso
was initially discovered.

07:47.344 --> 07:49.970
So, I met this guy.

07:49.971 --> 07:51.263
Come hit this.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.556
No, I'm good, thank you.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.557
We met on the subway.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.062
He actually works
at the sandwich place near my office.

07:58.063 --> 08:00.106
Awesome. Get us some free sandys

08:00.107 --> 08:02.524
I can't. It was more of a…

08:02.525 --> 08:04.235
interaction, I guess.

08:04.236 --> 08:06.071
An interaction?

08:07.197 --> 08:08.989
You know, like, talking.

08:08.990 --> 08:13.411
- So hot.
- Practically coming.

08:13.412 --> 08:15.870
Wait, have you even had sex
since you moved in here with us?

08:15.871 --> 08:18.081
Never mind. You guys just…

08:18.082 --> 08:21.127
go back to watching The Jinx. Again.

08:21.128 --> 08:22.544
Look.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.171
Tomorrow, at lunch,

08:24.172 --> 08:26.173
go get a sandwich, and then
get your dick wet.

08:26.174 --> 08:27.675
One-stop shopping.

08:29.885 --> 08:32.429
So, you see this shape right here?

08:32.431 --> 08:34.472
- That's your pubic bone.
- OK.

08:34.474 --> 08:36.475
And you see this dark spot?

08:36.476 --> 08:39.894
Uh… No, not… Not really.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.480
That's…

08:41.481 --> 08:43.898
a tumor.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.360
It's… It's a tumor?

08:46.361 --> 08:47.611
Yes.

08:50.032 --> 08:52.408
You… You mean, like, "a tumor" tumor.

08:52.409 --> 08:54.910
At your age, most tumors are benign.

08:56.413 --> 08:59.123
- Which means harmless.
- Oh, I… I know, um…

08:59.124 --> 09:00.874
It's the malignant ones
we need to worry about,

09:00.875 --> 09:03.295
which is why I'm scheduling a biopsy.

09:07.257 --> 09:11.343
But I don't want you to be alarmed.

09:11.344 --> 09:12.635
Is, um…

09:12.636 --> 09:14.013
Is Elliot working today?

09:14.014 --> 09:15.639
Nah, he's out sick.

09:18.642 --> 09:19.560
Business or pleasure?

09:24.732 --> 09:28.651
Business.

09:28.652 --> 09:29.946
I'm just gonna…

09:32.740 --> 09:34.533
Pleasure.

09:34.534 --> 09:35.826
Thought so.

10:00.768 --> 10:04.940
OK, um…

10:14.574 --> 10:16.867
- Ready?
- Yeah.

10:19.913 --> 10:24.707
- This is just the anesthetic, OK?
- OK.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.004
… doubt they sent one to surrender.

10:29.005 --> 10:30.965
Cassie!

10:30.966 --> 10:32.551
Cass!

10:33.759 --> 10:34.760
Actual people. Oh, my God!

10:38.181 --> 10:40.142
Welcome to Willits.

10:41.143 --> 10:42.352
Cassie!

10:43.686 --> 10:45.605
Cassie!

10:46.606 --> 10:47.731
Yo.

10:49.192 --> 10:51.527
Brought you a sandwich.

10:51.528 --> 10:53.404
Martin thinks you're at Burning Man,

10:53.405 --> 10:56.198
even though I told him you had
the flu and to look it up,

10:56.199 --> 10:58.451
because Burning Man was in August.

10:59.619 --> 11:00.995
I'm out.

11:00.996 --> 11:02.454
What?

11:02.455 --> 11:04.415
Wha… Yo! Let's just stay home!

11:04.416 --> 11:05.542
Smoke a bowl.

11:08.628 --> 11:13.715
Do awful experiments.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.968
It's something
called Ewing's sarcoma.

11:15.969 --> 11:18.596
When did you find out?

11:18.597 --> 11:21.056
- Well, like, officially?
- Yeah.

11:21.057 --> 11:22.434
Yesterday.

11:26.855 --> 11:30.983
Jesus Christ!

11:30.984 --> 11:32.235
So what now?

11:33.904 --> 11:37.156
Uh, so now, I go, and I see a specialist.

11:37.157 --> 11:39.533
Oh, that's good that you're
seeing a specialist, right?

11:39.534 --> 11:42.244
Isn't it impossible
to get into a specialist?

11:42.245 --> 11:45.873
Wait, how did you know to go
to the doctor in the first place?

11:45.874 --> 11:48.125
You're like a human 20 Questions, huh?

11:48.126 --> 11:49.877
I'm sorry.

11:49.878 --> 11:51.086
It's just…

11:51.087 --> 11:52.671
I'm not an expert, obviously,

11:52.672 --> 11:54.173
but, um…

11:54.174 --> 11:56.091
I think I'm sick a lot of the times

11:56.092 --> 11:57.509
so I'm kind of a

11:57.510 --> 12:01.847
WebMD superuser, and, uh

12:01.848 --> 12:04.266
you know, you… The
sooner that you catch it,

12:04.267 --> 12:06.019
the sooner that you start treatment,

12:08.230 --> 12:08.772
- The higher the likelihood…
- That I don't die?

12:12.234 --> 12:14.443
Sorry.

12:14.444 --> 12:15.946
You already said that.

12:18.114 --> 12:20.491
What did your parents say?

12:20.492 --> 12:22.284
I haven't told them yet.

12:22.285 --> 12:24.537
You haven't told your parents?

12:26.331 --> 12:31.210
What about your friends?

12:31.211 --> 12:33.713
Why am I the first person
that you tell this to?

12:35.090 --> 12:37.508
Because we're strangers, I guess.

12:37.509 --> 12:39.051
I thought we were semi-strangers.

12:39.052 --> 12:41.179
That's… That's very good.

12:42.097 --> 12:43.722
Um…

12:43.723 --> 12:45.600
No, I mean, just relative to the situation,

12:47.018 --> 12:48.727
everybody else would've freaked out.

12:48.728 --> 12:50.731
I'm pretty freaked out.

12:54.859 --> 12:58.862
Yeah, me too, bro.

12:58.863 --> 13:00.073
Um…

13:01.908 --> 13:04.827
I'm gonna take you out again, you know.

13:04.828 --> 13:07.414
We can talk about something else.

13:08.957 --> 13:10.710
Aren't you building an app?

13:11.626 --> 13:13.043
Sort of.

13:13.044 --> 13:14.253
You said it was gonna blow my mind.

13:14.254 --> 13:15.296
I said that?

13:15.297 --> 13:17.214
That's dumb.

13:17.215 --> 13:19.383
It's dumb. I shouldn't
have said that to you.

13:19.384 --> 13:20.843
Pitch it to me.

13:20.844 --> 13:22.595
I'll decide. Come on.

13:23.596 --> 13:25.098
I could be an investor.

13:27.100 --> 13:30.227
I don't have money, but, um…

13:30.228 --> 13:33.691
I could be a… a silent partner, you know?

13:34.858 --> 13:37.027
OK. Um… OK.

13:38.779 --> 13:40.404
So.

13:40.405 --> 13:41.822
It's supposed to help your life, you know,

13:41.823 --> 13:43.657
like therapy.

13:43.658 --> 13:47.328
Except it's 99 cents instead
of 200 bucks an hour.

13:47.329 --> 13:48.871
OK.

13:48.872 --> 13:50.456
So, what you would do is you would tell it

13:50.457 --> 13:54.168
when you're feeling good or feeling bad.

13:54.169 --> 13:57.714
Uh, it would notice these
patterns, and then,

13:57.715 --> 14:00.966
it sort of recognizes what it
is that makes you happy.

14:00.967 --> 14:03.427
So what are the patterns based on, then?

14:03.428 --> 14:05.471
Who you're with, you know? Uh…

14:05.472 --> 14:07.181
What you're doing.

14:07.182 --> 14:11.602
What about where you live
or financial situation?

14:11.603 --> 14:14.063
Yeah. No, that… That could
definitely be a part of it.

14:14.064 --> 14:16.733
Or… Brain chemistry?

14:16.734 --> 14:19.653
Also, if you're a girl, you're PMS-ing.
Stuff like that?

14:25.575 --> 14:29.870
A guy, if you have cancer?

14:29.871 --> 14:32.539
Someone got fucked.

14:32.540 --> 14:34.083
How was his cock?

14:34.084 --> 14:36.711
We didn't… Just talked.

14:36.712 --> 14:38.797
Oh, so another interaction?

14:38.798 --> 14:40.339
Yeah.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.425
We don't believe you.

14:52.394 --> 14:54.395
Hey, Lindsay?

14:54.396 --> 14:55.522
Sup?

14:56.564 --> 14:57.775
Can you, um…

14:58.776 --> 15:00.901
Come feel my boob?

15:00.902 --> 15:02.486
Uh… No.

15:02.487 --> 15:04.571
No, I… I feel a lump.

15:04.572 --> 15:07.618
You're so dramatic.
Maybe you have lumpy tits.

15:28.681 --> 15:33.643
Can you please just come in and check?

15:33.644 --> 15:35.436
The most effective treatment

15:35.437 --> 15:38.063
tends to combine eight to ten rounds
of chemotherapy

15:38.064 --> 15:39.650
with targeted radiation.

15:40.776 --> 15:42.526
I'd like to start next week.

15:42.527 --> 15:44.361
How does that sound?

15:44.362 --> 15:47.030
You're like a kid-cancer doctor.

15:47.031 --> 15:48.908
Sort of.

15:48.909 --> 15:51.326
All right, so, aren't
I a little bit too old for this?

15:51.327 --> 15:53.746
Typically, Ewing's
patients are younger, yes.

15:53.747 --> 15:56.957
But I see people your age… I've
seen people into their thirties.

15:56.958 --> 15:58.500
Which leads me to

15:58.501 --> 16:01.962
something else that we need to talk about.

16:01.963 --> 16:05.048
Have you thought about banking your sperm?

16:05.049 --> 16:07.845
Uh… What?

16:08.637 --> 16:11.640
There is a change that the radiation
affects fertility.

16:13.475 --> 16:16.895
You… You want me to…
To jerk off in a cup?

16:16.896 --> 16:19.062
If you're planning on having
children some day…

16:19.063 --> 16:20.857
I don't even have a girlfriend.

16:20.858 --> 16:22.609
I understand, but before treatment,

16:22.610 --> 16:25.069
that's the time to do it. Just in case.

16:28.364 --> 16:32.536
Right.

17:41.271 --> 17:43.188
Once you're done with the sample,

17:43.189 --> 17:45.650
put it in the metal tray to your right.

17:45.651 --> 17:47.819
There is a-magazines by the sink.

17:47.820 --> 17:48.987
OK, great.

17:48.988 --> 17:51.322
We have all sizes and shapes.

18:14.137 --> 18:18.181
Got it.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.309
Come on.

18:21.812 --> 18:23.689
What's the WiFi?

18:25.649 --> 18:29.694
No public WiFi!

18:29.695 --> 18:30.904
Hi.

18:34.365 --> 18:37.785
Wow.

18:37.786 --> 18:40.580
I wanna totally pay money
to suck your dick right now.

18:40.581 --> 18:43.206
Oh, that's uh…

18:43.207 --> 18:45.250
That's very helpful. Thank you

18:45.251 --> 18:46.462
You're welcome.

18:49.089 --> 18:51.173
You think you wanna… talk some more?

18:51.174 --> 18:53.468
I love podcasts.

18:53.469 --> 18:54.844
Uh, no, more like

18:54.845 --> 18:56.596
what you were saying before.

18:56.597 --> 18:59.264
Oh, OK, um…

18:59.265 --> 19:01.726
Your dick is so huge.

19:01.727 --> 19:04.937
No, no, I feel like you're
overcompensating for the podcast thing.

19:04.938 --> 19:07.774
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

19:07.775 --> 19:10.026
Um, your dick is totally above average.

19:10.027 --> 19:12.235
That's cool.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.740
Sixty-third percentile.

19:16.199 --> 19:17.700
Oh.

19:19.495 --> 19:21.537
<i>♪ Keep me close to you ♪</i>

19:21.538 --> 19:23.330
Oh, my God.

19:23.331 --> 19:26.334

19:26.335 --> 19:30.338
<i>♪ No one's gonna love me like you do ♪</i>

19:30.339 --> 19:32.341
- <i>♪ Ooh ♪</i>
- Ah!

19:35.719 --> 19:40.056
<i>♪ Keep me out with you… ♪</i>

19:40.057 --> 19:41.182
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:45.104 --> 19:49.482
Come here. Hi.

19:49.483 --> 19:50.608
Do you want to come in?

19:50.609 --> 19:52.192
I read about this one kid

19:52.193 --> 19:54.487
who was diagnosed with stage-4 Ewing's.

19:54.488 --> 19:55.738
Now he has a whole family.

19:55.739 --> 19:57.365
Like, owns 13 car-washes.

19:57.366 --> 19:58.950
Yeah, I don't…

19:58.951 --> 20:00.493
I don't really want to own car-washes.

20:00.494 --> 20:02.663
Point is… is that he's healthy.

20:03.664 --> 20:05.957
Also, car-washes are lucrative.

20:05.958 --> 20:08.292
You know that when you find
Ewing's this early, it's like,

20:08.293 --> 20:10.545
70% survival rate.

20:10.546 --> 20:13.214
Yeah, but how many people get
Ewing's in the first place?

20:14.883 --> 20:16.135
One in a million.

20:16.468 --> 20:18.929
All right, so, fuck statistics

20:21.765 --> 20:25.352
Hey, you're being really nice.
I'm being a dick, all right?

20:28.147 --> 20:32.275
It's OK. You're allowed
to be a dick right now.

20:32.276 --> 20:33.526
Did you tell your parents?

20:33.527 --> 20:35.445
Mm. They're in Jersey.

20:35.446 --> 20:37.447
Oh, they don't have phones in Jersey?

20:37.448 --> 20:40.533
Man, you're like obsessed
with me telling my parents.

20:40.534 --> 20:42.827
Why don't you tell your parents?

20:42.828 --> 20:44.746
Parent.

20:44.747 --> 20:45.830
Oh.

20:45.831 --> 20:47.915
Yeah, just my mom.

20:47.916 --> 20:49.459
Right, so your dad, did he…

20:49.460 --> 20:51.294
pass away, or?

20:51.295 --> 20:53.921
He's not dead, technically.

20:53.922 --> 20:56.257
He got two women pregnant, and uh…

20:56.258 --> 20:57.717
chose the other one.

20:57.718 --> 21:00.720
So, now he has four kids in Colorado.

21:00.721 --> 21:03.055
Oh, what an asshole.

21:03.056 --> 21:05.516
Yeah, he got me paintbrushes
for Christmas last year.

21:05.517 --> 21:08.728
Oh, that's cool. So you paint?

21:08.729 --> 21:11.439
No.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.608
- …was unreliable.
- Oh, yeah. Woah!

21:13.609 --> 21:15.610
There's a dude here.

21:15.611 --> 21:16.736
That's a dude!

21:16.737 --> 21:18.488
Like… The dude?

21:18.489 --> 21:20.198
Oh! There's a dude?

21:20.199 --> 21:21.991
Let's, uh… We're gonna go to my room.

21:21.992 --> 21:24.327
- Oh! OK.
- Mm-hmm.

21:24.328 --> 21:26.162
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:26.163 --> 21:28.249
- Bye, dude!
- Peace out!

21:38.008 --> 21:40.260
So, uh, who is he?

21:40.261 --> 21:41.928
Who's who?

21:41.929 --> 21:44.013
Your slam piece.

21:44.014 --> 21:46.432
Does he work in toothpaste
marketing with you?

21:46.433 --> 21:49.018
I don't have a slam piece.

21:49.019 --> 21:50.686
You remember the toothpaste thing?

21:50.687 --> 21:52.272
Yeah.

21:52.273 --> 21:54.482
Never met a toothpaste marketer before.

21:54.483 --> 21:56.567
Oh, please don't refer to me
as a toothpaste marketer.

21:56.568 --> 21:58.070
OK.

22:00.697 --> 22:02.323
OK, if you could have…

22:02.324 --> 22:04.408
any job,

22:04.409 --> 22:06.245
what would it be?

22:06.246 --> 22:08.538
There's not, like, one job.

22:08.539 --> 22:10.415
Not even when you were little?

22:11.792 --> 22:13.584
Well, um…

22:13.585 --> 22:16.255
I always had this vision…

22:16.256 --> 22:19.507
of going to, like, a big
office building every day

22:19.508 --> 22:22.677
and wearing a… a pantsuit
like women on TV

22:22.678 --> 22:25.638
that are important and powerful and

22:25.639 --> 22:26.681
in a hurry.

22:26.682 --> 22:28.975
I think that's great.

22:28.976 --> 22:32.019
And, I mean, I think you
would look great in a pantsuit.

22:32.020 --> 22:34.147
I don't know.

22:34.148 --> 22:35.815
Right now, I'm just, uh,

22:35.816 --> 22:37.817
putting numbers into Excel
all day, every day

22:37.818 --> 22:39.819
until my brain turns to Play-Doh.

22:39.820 --> 22:42.864
Or you could go be a business
woman somewhere else.

22:42.865 --> 22:44.908
Took me a year to get this job.

22:46.535 --> 22:50.538
It's not that easy.

22:50.539 --> 22:52.790
So…

22:52.791 --> 22:54.792
If I were gonna go to Jersey,
you know, theoretically…

22:54.793 --> 22:57.003
Not theoretically. You have to go.

22:57.004 --> 22:58.755
Right, um…

23:00.216 --> 23:01.550
Would you…

23:03.552 --> 23:05.637
Would you want to come with me?

23:06.513 --> 23:08.308
- To Jersey?
- Yeah.

23:10.559 --> 23:12.476
Woah…

23:12.477 --> 23:14.770
Oh, no, that was weird.

23:14.771 --> 23:16.149
Little bit.

23:17.108 --> 23:19.401
Shit, um…

23:22.613 --> 23:26.909
I'm sorry.

23:38.087 --> 23:39.545
You have a beautiful home.

23:39.546 --> 23:40.588
Really.

23:40.589 --> 23:41.964
Thank you.

23:41.965 --> 23:43.966
Furniture, decorations, it's…

23:43.967 --> 23:46.761
- it's… very nice…
- Mia, it's OK, you can relax.

23:46.762 --> 23:47.762
We're pretty easy-going.

23:47.763 --> 23:49.764
Cool, yeah. Me too.

23:49.765 --> 23:51.766
We are glad you came out.

23:51.767 --> 23:54.018
Especially since it's been…
How long's it been?

23:54.019 --> 23:55.270
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

23:55.271 --> 23:57.730
Sorry guys.

23:57.731 --> 24:01.068
Elliot's not exactly forthcoming
about the romantic chapters in his life.

24:01.069 --> 24:02.361
Well, it's assuming
most of them are paragraphs

24:02.362 --> 24:04.237
not chapters, so…

24:04.238 --> 24:05.738
I mean, I'd still
like to know who he's seeing.

24:05.739 --> 24:07.865
Really? Even the DTFs?

24:07.866 --> 24:10.202
OK, what's a DTF?

24:10.203 --> 24:11.744
You know, Down To…

24:11.745 --> 24:13.288
Down To… I don't…

24:13.289 --> 24:14.956
Down To Fuck!

24:14.957 --> 24:18.919
- OK. Jesus, babe.
- That's what they say now.

24:19.087 --> 24:22.423
She just signed up for the Urban
Dictionary word of the day.

24:23.840 --> 24:26.259
Hey, I know we're embarrassing, but

24:26.260 --> 24:28.096
You could participate.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.639
Uh…

24:31.640 --> 24:33.184
Everything all right?

24:35.269 --> 24:37.980
Are… Are you gonna tell them?

24:39.107 --> 24:41.108
Tell us what?

24:41.109 --> 24:42.276
Nothing.

24:43.652 --> 24:45.071
E… Elliot.

24:46.488 --> 24:48.281
What's going on, Elliot?

24:48.282 --> 24:50.034
Hey. Hey, hey.

24:53.704 --> 24:58.291
Um…

24:58.292 --> 25:01.461
It's a form of bone cancer
localized in the pelvis.

25:01.462 --> 25:03.422
What?

25:03.423 --> 25:05.840
He has cancer. The cancer
is called Ewing's sarcoma…

25:05.841 --> 25:08.843
OK, stop. Stop saying cancer.

25:08.844 --> 25:11.138
I… It's OK.

25:11.139 --> 25:13.015
I mean, it's not… It's
not OK, but you know,

25:13.016 --> 25:14.724
it hasn't spread,

25:14.725 --> 25:17.019
and he met with a specialist
at Dalton Russet…

25:17.020 --> 25:19.895
All right, who the hell are you? I'm sorry.

25:19.896 --> 25:21.772
I'm Mia.

25:21.773 --> 25:23.692
Oh, my God.

25:39.375 --> 25:41.419
Thank you for coming with me.

25:48.633 --> 25:52.887
Well, I'm free tomorrow if you
want to go back and do it again.

<i>♪ If love's a gun… ♪</i>

26:30.176 --> 26:31.426
Is this OK?

26:31.427 --> 26:33.386
You're asking me?

26:33.387 --> 26:35.180
Is this OK for you?

26:35.181 --> 26:36.765
You kidding me? My Make-A-Wish.

26:38.767 --> 26:40.185
That's not funny.

26:40.186 --> 26:41.521
You laughed.

26:43.231 --> 26:44.773
I meant for your pelvis.

26:47.401 --> 26:48.528
Be gentle.

26:49.736 --> 26:52.489
That's my preferred style anyways.

27:00.957 --> 27:02.416
Wow.

27:04.001 --> 27:05.545
So you are alive.

27:05.752 --> 27:08.214
No, man, I'm asleep.

27:10.133 --> 27:13.260
Oh. Ham and cheese girl.

27:13.261 --> 27:15.512
Uh, Nico, Mia. Mia…

27:15.513 --> 27:18.140
Nico.

27:18.141 --> 27:19.891
I'm gonna go.

27:19.892 --> 27:21.809
You could stay.

27:21.810 --> 27:24.312
This is why you haven't
answered my 400 texts, huh?

27:24.313 --> 27:26.565
'Cause you got, like, a girlfriend, now?

27:26.566 --> 27:29.109
We were supposed to be single
'til we were 30. At least.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.987
And now, you don't even tell me!
You just disappear?

27:31.988 --> 27:34.781
P.S. Martin says you're fired.
He told me to tell you that.

27:35.992 --> 27:38.077
Also, you look like shit.
And that's me saying that.

27:40.288 --> 27:43.040
Uh… Goodbye, Nico.

27:45.877 --> 27:50.088
Yeah, see ya.

27:50.089 --> 27:51.215
I got to, um…

27:52.757 --> 27:54.594
I gotta tell you something.

27:56.846 --> 27:58.264
Um…

28:14.779 --> 28:18.951
- I have…
- Chlamydia? What?

28:25.082 --> 28:28.044
…factoring in the difference
in purchasing power.

28:29.170 --> 28:31.255
Who are you texting, Mia?

28:40.473 --> 28:44.768
Uh, no one.

29:09.794 --> 29:13.004
We're having trouble
finding any more usable veins.

29:13.005 --> 29:14.965
Right, well, they could
use the top of my hands,

29:14.966 --> 29:16.883
or go in between my toes, right?

29:16.884 --> 29:19.427
The priority is administering
the chemo properly.

29:19.428 --> 29:20.888
All right.

29:22.723 --> 29:25.016
A port will do that.

29:25.017 --> 29:26.643
No.

29:26.644 --> 29:29.437
No, ports cause infection, blood clots,

29:29.438 --> 29:31.064
they make it impossible to shower.

29:31.065 --> 29:33.358
Mia googled it.

29:33.359 --> 29:34.693
Who's Mia?

29:34.694 --> 29:36.444
My girlfriend.

29:36.445 --> 29:38.113
Congratulations.

29:38.114 --> 29:40.156
Is she a doctor?

29:40.157 --> 29:41.908
No, it doesn't matter, OK?

29:41.909 --> 29:44.286
I don't want you to put
a trapdoor into my body.

29:44.287 --> 29:46.121
OK, I will make you a deal.

29:46.122 --> 29:49.500
We try one more round of chemo VIA IV.

29:49.875 --> 29:53.254
If that doesn't work, then
I have to put in a chest port.

29:54.588 --> 29:57.340
Not even six months later,

29:57.341 --> 30:01.303
Gacy was charged with attempting
to molest yet another teenager.

30:01.304 --> 30:03.888
Yo. You wanna watch this
John Wayne Gacy thing with us?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.766
Uh, I just came for a change of clothes.

30:05.767 --> 30:08.811
Just sit with us for, like,
five minutes and relax.

30:10.646 --> 30:14.566
He was charged with rape. By 1970…

30:14.567 --> 30:17.610
…but he narrowly avoided
another rape conviction.

30:17.611 --> 30:21.324
Just days before the wedding,
he imitated a police officer

30:42.345 --> 30:46.848
to manipulate a boy to perform oral sex.

30:46.849 --> 30:49.017
You wanna do something today?

30:49.018 --> 30:50.728
No, I'm going back to Jersey.

30:50.729 --> 30:53.313
Mm. I can go with you.

30:53.314 --> 30:55.398
You know.

30:55.399 --> 30:57.068
Whip out the old Xbox.

30:57.401 --> 30:58.903
I'm going with Mia. Thanks, though.

31:01.530 --> 31:03.658
Yeah. Cool.

31:09.163 --> 31:12.123
<i>♪ Baby, I can't sleep ♪</i>

31:12.124 --> 31:15.293
This is a tiny bit weird, isn't it?

31:15.294 --> 31:16.420
A little bit.

31:19.340 --> 31:21.007
Oh, you do that way too naturally.

31:21.008 --> 31:22.718
Thanks, mom.

31:22.719 --> 31:24.220
That was not a compliment.

31:26.263 --> 31:27.555
Medicinal shit's potent!

31:27.556 --> 31:29.058
It's not medicinal.

31:39.485 --> 31:40.779
Oh!

31:43.615 --> 31:45.907
- Mmm.
- Damn, mom.

31:45.908 --> 31:48.159
Why do you sound so shocked?

31:48.160 --> 31:50.245
You, like, rap on the side, too?

31:50.246 --> 31:52.706
- Just a little bit.
- It's a stereotype, Elliot.

31:52.707 --> 31:54.625
I just wish I knew
that in high school, you know.

31:54.626 --> 31:56.251
I wouldn't have spent
all that money on Visine.

31:56.252 --> 31:57.544
We knew you were high.

31:57.545 --> 31:58.671
You did?

31:58.672 --> 32:01.214
- Oh!
- Of course!

32:01.215 --> 32:04.301
It's too many revelations in one day!
I can't!

32:05.469 --> 32:08.012
You see, Mia.

32:08.013 --> 32:09.431
We're bonding as a family.

32:09.432 --> 32:10.600
Mm-hmm.

32:13.687 --> 32:16.020
Man, you guys are…

32:16.021 --> 32:17.231
awesome.

32:19.024 --> 32:23.445
Really cool.

32:23.446 --> 32:24.655
- Good, right?
- Mm-hmm.

32:24.656 --> 32:26.448
Really good look. Mm-hmm.

32:26.449 --> 32:27.909
I want you to do it.

32:29.410 --> 32:30.952
What?

32:30.953 --> 32:33.037
Yeah, just gimme… Gimme like a fade.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.708
- What the heck is a fade?
- Give me a flattop.

32:35.709 --> 32:37.333
- I'm too high.
- I'm too high, too.

32:37.334 --> 32:39.461
Just do whatever you want to do.

32:39.462 --> 32:41.172
This is a very big thing.

32:43.007 --> 32:46.802
I trust you.

32:46.803 --> 32:47.803
OK.

32:47.804 --> 32:48.930
Yeah?

32:50.306 --> 32:52.265
- OK, I'll do it.
- OK.

32:52.266 --> 32:54.268
- Boy, oh boy.
- OK.

32:55.352 --> 32:57.061
All right. One…

32:57.062 --> 32:58.189
Two…

32:59.148 --> 33:00.232
Three…

33:05.572 --> 33:08.407
How is it?

33:14.581 --> 33:20.168
Wait, are you… Are you still
gonna be attracted to me?

33:20.169 --> 33:24.464
I don't wanna have to go back to my stupid
fluorescent cubicle tomorrow.

33:24.465 --> 33:26.675
You should call in sick.

33:26.676 --> 33:29.093
I used all my sick days.

33:29.094 --> 33:30.304
Oh.

33:31.848 --> 33:33.808
Come here.

33:34.475 --> 33:35.476
- Why?
- Come here.

33:38.813 --> 33:41.148
Ah!

33:48.490 --> 33:52.868
Now you got all my germs.
You can't go.

33:52.869 --> 33:54.829
Can I tell you something?

33:58.959 --> 34:03.086
Yeah.

34:03.087 --> 34:04.296
I love you.

34:07.717 --> 34:11.513
I love you.

34:13.639 --> 34:17.811
I'm really in love with you.

34:22.398 --> 34:24.483
Mia!

34:24.484 --> 34:28.402
Your work this last month
has been unacceptable.

34:28.404 --> 34:30.781
You're late, you're distracted,

34:30.782 --> 34:34.283
you're negligent. You know, I had
to resend the Nissan deck,

34:34.284 --> 34:38.079
because you didn't notice
that the CMO's name was misspelled.

34:38.080 --> 34:41.291
- I'm sorry. I just…
- Do you want to keep this job?

34:41.292 --> 34:42.751
Of course.

34:42.752 --> 34:44.418
Then don't give me an excuse.

34:44.420 --> 34:47.338
Just make sure that this
laziness or apathy or

34:47.339 --> 34:50.382
- whatever it is disappears.
- OK.

34:50.384 --> 34:52.261
There's not gonna be another warning.

34:53.597 --> 34:55.639
Oh, and clean yourself up.

34:56.850 --> 34:58.183
You look like you just stumbled
out of a Bushwick commune.

35:01.021 --> 35:02.438
I'm not lazy.

35:02.439 --> 35:04.188
You know that I'm not lazy.

35:04.189 --> 35:06.107
I took a six a.m. train from Jersey,

35:06.108 --> 35:08.777
- because my boyfriend is sick…
- Oh!

35:08.778 --> 35:10.070
Boyfriend drama

35:10.071 --> 35:12.072
is an excuse.

35:12.073 --> 35:13.616
Fuck you.

35:13.617 --> 35:16.242
- What?
- Yeah.

35:16.243 --> 35:18.621
Fuck you! You think that you
can talk to me like this?

35:18.622 --> 35:20.831
Like I'm not a fucking person?

35:20.832 --> 35:23.667
And you were the one that misspell
the CMO's last name,

35:23.668 --> 35:26.252
because you spell
like a fucking first-grader.

35:26.253 --> 35:27.756
Get out.

35:47.859 --> 35:52.030
See ya later, alligator. Fucking A.

36:04.249 --> 36:09.171
Same haircut.

36:11.758 --> 36:15.595
The tumor isn't responding
to the treatment.

36:20.809 --> 36:25.186
I know that isn't an easy thing to hear.

36:25.187 --> 36:27.356
Well, I mean, there's…

36:27.357 --> 36:31.275
There's trials on, um, gemcetabine
combined with docetaxel…

36:31.276 --> 36:34.071
Trials are not a viable
option at this point.

36:34.072 --> 36:37.408
Could you have enrolled him in one earlier?

36:37.409 --> 36:38.909
We have to operate.

36:38.910 --> 36:40.494
Before the tumor metastasizes.

36:40.495 --> 36:41.662
Could you have put him in one or not?

36:41.663 --> 36:44.331
Could we just listen, Mia?

36:44.332 --> 36:47.459
It feels like I know more about Ewing's
than everyone in this fucking hospital…

36:47.460 --> 36:49.420
All right, well, you
don't, so stop talking.

36:49.421 --> 36:52.423
Normally, these discussions
are held in private.

36:52.424 --> 36:54.007
You're doing me a favor?

36:54.008 --> 36:56.885
Me being here is a favor?

36:56.886 --> 36:58.471
Um…

36:59.723 --> 37:02.142
How often does the surgery work?

37:11.276 --> 37:15.988
About 20% of the time.

37:15.989 --> 37:17.699
Do you want to just keep walking?

37:20.034 --> 37:23.996
I'm too cold.

37:23.997 --> 37:25.123
Hey!

37:27.584 --> 37:29.626
Hey, you know, you could apologize!

37:29.627 --> 37:30.961
Hey, fucking asshole!

37:30.962 --> 37:33.213
Hey, stop.

37:33.214 --> 37:36.300
Hey, I hope you choke on your beard,
you cock-sucking little bitch!

37:36.301 --> 37:38.594
The fuck are you looking at?

37:38.595 --> 37:39.845
Go back to your iPhones, cunts!

37:39.846 --> 37:41.138
Fuck!

37:41.139 --> 37:43.182
Just calm down, OK?

37:43.183 --> 37:45.058
People are looking at me like I'm
handicapped or something!

37:45.059 --> 37:48.563
Because you're yelling
mean things to people!

37:49.647 --> 37:52.065
Why are you so nice to me, huh?

37:52.066 --> 37:55.527
I'm ruining your life! You lost your job!

37:55.528 --> 37:57.321
- Because of me!
- I quit my job!

37:57.322 --> 37:59.948
Leave! Before this gets worse!
I'm serious, leave!

37:59.949 --> 38:01.450
I'm not going anywhere, Elliot!

38:01.451 --> 38:02.951
- You got it?
- Please leave!

38:02.952 --> 38:04.828
- Stop! Stop!
- Please leave.

38:04.829 --> 38:05.996
Listen to me.

38:05.997 --> 38:07.916
I'm not going anywhere.

38:17.259 --> 38:21.554
OK?

38:22.180 --> 38:23.807

42:39.188 --> 42:40.730
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

42:42.316 --> 42:43.983
Look, don't you have any friends for me?

42:43.984 --> 42:45.650
I mean, my regular dick works great.

42:45.651 --> 42:49.072
I mean, my roommates.

42:49.073 --> 42:50.531
Yep, they're obsessed with murder.

42:50.532 --> 42:51.615
Uh, anyone else?

42:51.616 --> 42:54.161
No, not really.

42:54.536 --> 42:57.372
Right, 'cause you're too busy claiming
Elliot for yourself all the time.

42:59.291 --> 43:00.959
This naan is bomb.

43:03.795 --> 43:05.587
Should have it at my funeral.

43:05.588 --> 43:08.049
- What?
- You should order Indian food, you know,

43:08.050 --> 43:09.092
for my funeral.

43:09.093 --> 43:11.552
Don't say shit like that.

43:11.553 --> 43:14.180
I just mean, I don't want it to be
all somber and quiet, you know?

43:14.181 --> 43:15.306
I want people to have fun.

43:15.307 --> 43:16.890
Wear real clothes

43:16.891 --> 43:19.851
and get fucked up and only listen to Kanye.

43:19.852 --> 43:22.231
Your surgery is gonna go great.

43:23.899 --> 43:26.568
And then, we'll do whatever you want.

43:51.759 --> 43:55.804
- OK?
- Yeah. What she said.

43:55.805 --> 43:56.932
Hey, Mia.

43:59.476 --> 44:03.437
Mm-hmm.

44:03.438 --> 44:05.274
Will you marry me?

44:07.151 --> 44:08.902
Wh… What?

44:10.362 --> 44:12.030
I just wanna know that I married you.

44:14.616 --> 44:16.909
You're the best.

44:16.910 --> 44:18.953
You're the most beautiful

44:18.954 --> 44:20.829
and the kindest.

44:20.830 --> 44:21.957
Yes.

44:23.208 --> 44:26.460
- Yeah?
- Yes! Fuck yes!

44:26.461 --> 44:28.337
Yes? I don't have a…

44:28.338 --> 44:30.548
- I don't have a ring, or…
- I don't care.

44:30.549 --> 44:32.426
I don't care.

44:34.677 --> 44:36.387
To love and to hold

44:36.388 --> 44:38.973
from this day forward

44:38.974 --> 44:41.310
as long as we both shall live.

44:42.436 --> 44:44.354
With this ring, I thee wed.

44:46.607 --> 44:48.483
With this ring,

44:57.201 --> 45:01.496
I thee wed.

45:35.656 --> 45:37.157
Do you want to split Funyuns?

45:38.825 --> 45:39.952
I'm not hungry.

45:43.538 --> 45:47.291
Me neither.

45:47.292 --> 45:49.085
I didn't mean to take him away from you

45:49.086 --> 45:51.295
these past couple months.

45:51.296 --> 45:52.505
He talks about you a lot.

45:52.506 --> 45:53.632
Don't do that.

45:56.426 --> 46:00.429
We, um…

46:00.430 --> 46:01.556
We got married.

46:03.141 --> 46:04.268
What?

46:05.394 --> 46:06.852
We got married.

46:06.853 --> 46:07.980
You got married?

46:09.356 --> 46:10.439
Yeah.

46:10.440 --> 46:11.899
That's fucking crazy.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.359
Why? What's the point?

46:13.360 --> 46:14.653
Why do we need a point?

46:15.779 --> 46:17.655
To get married?

46:17.656 --> 46:19.865
Seems like you really thought it through.

46:19.866 --> 46:21.659
We wanted to do it, so we did.

46:21.660 --> 46:23.745
I'm sorry that that pisses you off so much.

46:23.746 --> 46:25.247
What did Paul and Rebecca say?

46:27.040 --> 46:28.582
We were in a park,

46:28.583 --> 46:31.086
sitting on a bench, and he asked.

46:32.212 --> 46:34.463
Did you wear a dress?

46:34.464 --> 46:36.299
Jeans.

46:36.300 --> 46:38.592
Hmm. And Elliot?

46:38.593 --> 46:40.177
Also jeans.

46:40.178 --> 46:42.263
Good. He's cute in jeans.

46:42.264 --> 46:44.558
Oh, my God. That was such
a stupid thing to say.

46:46.351 --> 46:48.227
That's not. He does.

46:48.228 --> 46:49.979
I wish we could've been there.

46:49.980 --> 46:51.106
I know.

46:52.107 --> 46:54.568
I'm sorry.

46:57.654 --> 47:01.907
It was just like a… you
know, a shotgun wedding.

47:01.908 --> 47:04.368
Honey, are you pregnant?

47:04.369 --> 47:06.871
What? No. No, no.

47:06.872 --> 47:08.289
No, I'm not.

47:08.290 --> 47:09.457
Oh, my God. You're pregnant.

47:09.458 --> 47:10.624
Holy fucking shit.

47:10.625 --> 47:12.251
Oh, no. No, I… I promise.

47:12.252 --> 47:13.919
I am not… definitely not pregnant.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.004
Really.

47:15.005 --> 47:16.339
I'm sorry.

47:16.340 --> 47:18.591
- Then wh…
- So, you meant, uh…

47:18.592 --> 47:19.592
What?

47:19.593 --> 47:22.137
Um, I just meant like…

47:23.472 --> 47:26.099
It felt like a… a ticking clock.

47:52.501 --> 47:57.172
You know?

Hey.

48:45.345 --> 48:46.596
Hey.

48:46.597 --> 48:48.139
Hi.

48:48.140 --> 48:49.974
Will you talk to me?

48:49.975 --> 48:51.268
I'm… I'm excited.

48:52.770 --> 48:56.063
You might change your mind
once you meet her.

48:56.064 --> 48:58.817
You've done everything for me, right?

48:58.818 --> 49:00.653
We can spend a weekend with your mom.

49:02.028 --> 49:03.321
She's my mom, too, now.

49:09.202 --> 49:13.415
I am so sorry about that.

49:21.591 --> 49:24.843
Oh, my baby, baby, baby.

49:24.844 --> 49:27.679
Finally coming to see me.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.681
Look at you.

49:29.682 --> 49:31.182
This is Elliot.

49:31.183 --> 49:32.475
Hi, it's so nice to meet you, Mom.

49:32.476 --> 49:33.852
Come here. Hey.

49:33.853 --> 49:35.854
Mom. That's funny.

49:35.855 --> 49:36.855
That's a good one.

49:36.856 --> 49:38.022
Hey. Blake.

49:38.023 --> 49:39.566
Oh.

49:39.567 --> 49:41.025
- I've heard so much about you.
- Yes.

49:41.026 --> 49:42.026
- Elliot.
- Blake.

49:42.027 --> 49:43.277
Hey.

49:43.278 --> 49:45.112
Two beautiful Wolfensparker women.

49:45.113 --> 49:46.865
- Oh, yeah.
- How lucky are we? Right?

49:46.866 --> 49:49.408
Actually, I changed my name.

49:49.409 --> 49:50.993
To what?

49:50.994 --> 49:52.580
To Elliot's last name, Baker.

49:55.165 --> 49:56.791
- That's…
- Hey, you know what?

49:56.792 --> 49:58.250
- Um, Mia, give me your bag…
- Oh, thank you.

49:58.251 --> 49:59.544
- Elliot…
- Thank you. Yeah.

49:59.545 --> 50:01.462
One more, one more.

50:01.463 --> 50:03.715
- Let's have a drink, right?
- Yes.

50:03.716 --> 50:04.966
- How's it going?
- Look at you. You look so beautiful.

50:04.967 --> 50:06.718
- Hi. Yeah.
- Isn't he great?

50:06.719 --> 50:08.720
He's cute isn't he? Blake?

50:08.721 --> 50:10.722
Oh, my God. Look at you.

50:10.723 --> 50:13.767
Why did she have to put
the braces pictures in here?

50:13.768 --> 50:16.645
- I think pink's cute.
- Yeah, but I had them until the 11th grade.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.647
That wouldn't have stopped me.

50:18.648 --> 50:19.731
Definitely would have.

50:19.732 --> 50:21.273
How do you know?

50:21.274 --> 50:25.402
Because… I kissed 3 boys in high school.

50:25.403 --> 50:26.780
Two felt me up.

50:26.781 --> 50:28.239
One fingered me.

50:28.240 --> 50:30.116
And that is it.

50:31.494 --> 50:33.161
And when did you lose your virginity?

50:34.454 --> 50:35.664
Oh.

50:35.665 --> 50:37.206
Um.

50:37.207 --> 50:40.042
First semester, sophomore year of college.

50:40.043 --> 50:41.586
And who was he?

50:41.587 --> 50:43.713
And was it serious or…

50:43.714 --> 50:46.257
Zach Mancuso.

50:46.258 --> 50:48.010
I called him, "Ginger Zach."

50:49.804 --> 50:51.930
We had sex three and a half times.

50:51.931 --> 50:53.558
He sounds like a stud.

50:55.267 --> 50:56.894
Yeah. Real stud.

51:05.570 --> 51:08.488
It's kind of weird that we haven't
talked about this stuff.

51:08.489 --> 51:09.614
We're talking about it now.

51:09.615 --> 51:11.032
Yeah.

51:11.033 --> 51:12.785
It just seems kind of backwards.

51:14.286 --> 51:16.287
So, who was yours?

51:16.288 --> 51:19.206
Um… Tanya Wasserman.

51:19.207 --> 51:22.043
Guessing not sophomore year of college.

51:22.044 --> 51:24.253
It was freshman year.

51:24.254 --> 51:26.256
OK, so both late bloomers.

51:27.842 --> 51:32.053
It was freshman year of high school.

51:32.054 --> 51:35.766
You've had five more sex years than me.

51:42.105 --> 51:46.484
Yeah. So what?

51:46.485 --> 51:47.903
So, what's your number?

51:49.071 --> 51:50.989
My number?

51:50.990 --> 51:51.990
Yeah.

51:51.991 --> 51:53.116
Your number.

51:54.744 --> 51:57.787
Um… 12.

51:57.788 --> 51:59.247
I've had sex with four people.

52:00.290 --> 52:01.625
Including you.

52:01.626 --> 52:03.376
Including Vanessa.

52:03.377 --> 52:04.586
With Vanessa?

52:04.587 --> 52:06.546
The girl from the threesome.

52:06.547 --> 52:07.714
What? You didn't count her?

52:07.715 --> 52:08.841
That doesn't matter now.

52:10.509 --> 52:12.052
So, 13 girls.

52:12.053 --> 52:14.764
Who cares, huh?

52:16.557 --> 52:21.310
You're the only one I even look at now

52:21.311 --> 52:24.188
- You okay?
- Yeah, thank you.

52:24.189 --> 52:26.566
So, I run the grounds
crew at the stadium.

52:26.567 --> 52:29.318
OK, so basically, I, um…
I plant the grass.

52:29.319 --> 52:31.195
And then I water the grass.

52:31.196 --> 52:34.491
And then, I replace the grass.

52:34.492 --> 52:36.368
But that's probably
a whole more about grass

52:36.369 --> 52:37.869
that you don't want to hear about, right?

52:37.870 --> 52:39.663
But I do get to watch a lot of baseball.

52:39.664 --> 52:41.205
- Oh, that's so cool.
- Right?

52:41.206 --> 52:42.624
- Yeah.
- What do you do, Elliot?

52:42.625 --> 52:44.042
Um.

52:44.043 --> 52:45.835
I'm just taking some classes right now.

52:45.836 --> 52:47.545
Just getting back on his feet.

52:47.546 --> 52:48.630
Yeah. I'm on… I'm on my feet.

52:48.631 --> 52:50.340
Um…

52:50.341 --> 52:51.925
But, yeah, I'm… I'm learning how to code.

52:51.926 --> 52:53.927
And I wanna design apps.

52:53.928 --> 52:56.137
You know, that's the goal.
At least it's something.

52:56.138 --> 52:58.263
And what about the cancer?

52:58.264 --> 53:00.809
I mean, are you going to the doctor?

53:00.810 --> 53:02.519
- You get check-ups?
- Yeah.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.521
Yeah. It's every six months.

53:04.522 --> 53:05.814
That's really brave of you, Elliot.

53:05.815 --> 53:07.065
I don't know how you do it.

53:07.066 --> 53:08.441
I don't know about brave.

53:08.442 --> 53:10.777
You know, I never had any choice.

53:10.778 --> 53:13.947
He is brave. Very, very brave.

53:13.948 --> 53:15.740
Getting married. Now that's brave.

53:17.410 --> 53:20.202
Well, we're in love, so…

53:20.203 --> 53:21.705
it seems right.

53:21.706 --> 53:22.789
Well, it's right right now.

53:22.790 --> 53:23.832
Hey, come on.

53:23.833 --> 53:25.249
Mom.

53:25.250 --> 53:27.251
Hey, I've been married twice.

53:27.252 --> 53:28.712
So, clearly, you know
what you're talking about.

53:32.466 --> 53:34.926
Um, how'd you two meet?

53:34.927 --> 53:37.554
- Well, we, uh…
- It's… you could tell 'em.

53:37.555 --> 53:39.681
- It's kind of random.
- Online. Online, actually.

53:39.682 --> 53:41.975
- An app.
- Oh. Oh, it's very modern of you.

53:41.976 --> 53:43.436
- Yeah.
- So modern.

53:44.854 --> 53:46.312
Which, uh… which one?

53:46.313 --> 53:47.689
Bagel Meets Bagel.

53:47.690 --> 53:49.399
I thought it was a Jew thing.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.736
Turns out, non-denominational.

54:04.874 --> 54:09.170
Maybe you can work for them, huh?

54:10.296 --> 54:14.674
You OK?

54:14.675 --> 54:15.968
You wanna talk about it?

54:19.221 --> 54:23.558
Mm-mmm.

54:23.559 --> 54:25.603
Yeah, 'cause, uh…

54:31.901 --> 54:35.904
I don't think it went that bad.

54:35.905 --> 54:37.031
Shit.

54:39.575 --> 54:41.826
I forgot condoms. You have condoms?

54:41.827 --> 54:44.704
I didn't have sex in high school, remember?

54:44.705 --> 54:45.831
Right.

54:48.210 --> 54:49.834
We could, um…

54:49.835 --> 54:51.544
I am not doing anal.

54:51.545 --> 54:53.546
No, baby, I wasn't gonna say anal.

54:53.547 --> 54:54.881
We could do mouth stuff.

54:54.882 --> 54:57.259
Sure, or we could just not use one.

54:57.260 --> 54:59.262
I mean, I don't have chemo cum anymore.

55:06.519 --> 55:11.190
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

55:11.191 --> 55:13.609
Just don't finish inside me, OK?

55:14.819 --> 55:16.444
I love how you say finish.

55:16.445 --> 55:17.571
So proper.

55:18.989 --> 55:20.825
I have very good manners.

55:23.410 --> 55:25.788
So, where should I finish?

55:27.414 --> 55:29.291
Hmm.

55:29.292 --> 55:30.584
The floor?

55:31.877 --> 55:34.046
There's a rug.

55:35.215 --> 55:39.009
Oh, yeah.

55:40.262 --> 55:44.306
What about your tits?

55:44.307 --> 55:45.640
OK, cool.

55:45.641 --> 55:47.101
Cool.

55:49.603 --> 55:54.399
Good plan.

55:54.400 --> 55:56.277
It's going to be fine, right?

55:56.278 --> 55:57.360
Promise.

55:57.361 --> 55:59.070
How can you promise that?

55:59.071 --> 56:00.573
'Cause it all ended up on your chest.

56:01.532 --> 56:02.658
Pre-cum.

56:05.494 --> 56:07.246
There was this girl, Molly Fishner.

56:07.247 --> 56:10.039
She got pregnant two weeks before prom…

56:10.040 --> 56:11.457
because of pre-cum.

56:11.458 --> 56:12.668
I don't believe that.

56:14.420 --> 56:16.838
Maybe that was a hot tub incident.

56:16.839 --> 56:19.300
You see? It's fine.

56:19.301 --> 56:21.177
Still. You can't get pregnant,

56:26.765 --> 56:31.353
so you don't fully understand.

56:31.354 --> 56:32.813
What do you think about kids?

56:34.274 --> 56:35.899
Kids?

56:35.900 --> 56:37.026
Yeah.

56:39.069 --> 56:40.404
Kids are cool.

56:41.947 --> 56:43.241
I used to be one.

56:46.869 --> 56:48.121
I mean, like, having them.

56:50.998 --> 56:52.125
We're 23.

56:53.500 --> 56:54.710
Yeah. In the future.

56:56.629 --> 56:58.004
I mean…

56:58.005 --> 56:59.132
I guess, like…

57:00.591 --> 57:02.344
If I'm 35, maybe.

57:07.514 --> 57:11.976
If I'm healthy.

57:11.977 --> 57:13.687
Why? Do you wanna have kids?

57:17.483 --> 57:21.736
I don't know.

57:21.737 --> 57:22.863
We can get a dog.

57:26.033 --> 57:30.829
Hmm.

57:41.216 --> 57:44.467
<i>♪ Incomplete without tearing all the sleeves… ♪</i>

57:44.468 --> 57:45.885
Hey, take your shirt off.

57:47.097 --> 57:48.222
OK.

57:48.223 --> 57:49.264
Ow!

57:49.265 --> 57:50.349
Shit, are you OK?

57:50.350 --> 57:52.267
- Yeah.
- Yeah? All right.

58:07.491 --> 58:09.368

58:09.369 --> 58:10.494
I don't care.

58:13.622 --> 58:14.999
What about Dirty Dancing?

58:15.916 --> 58:16.916
Pass.

58:16.917 --> 58:18.043
Have you seen it?

58:18.044 --> 58:20.170
No.

58:20.171 --> 58:22.714
Then you don't know
what you're saying no to.

58:22.715 --> 58:24.383
I don't want to watch a dance movie.

58:24.384 --> 58:25.550
Sorry.

58:26.969 --> 58:29.389
So, you do care what we watch, then.

58:59.335 --> 59:01.545
So, who's staying in my room?

59:03.214 --> 59:07.384
This big, tall dude
from Germany named Henrik.

59:07.385 --> 59:09.053
Yeah, it sounds cultural.

59:09.054 --> 59:10.054
Hmm.

59:10.055 --> 59:11.513
I guess.

59:11.514 --> 59:12.931
Mostly, it's just weird.

59:13.975 --> 59:16.060
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:16.061 --> 59:18.312
Everything's weird.

59:18.313 --> 59:21.065
When did shit get so fucking weird?

59:21.066 --> 59:23.692
Probably when you got a big, fat tumor…

59:24.944 --> 59:29.114
and then married Mia.

59:29.115 --> 59:31.741
Hey. Do you even like her?

59:31.742 --> 59:32.909
Oh, forget it. I shouldn't have asked.

59:32.910 --> 59:34.328
Yeah, I mean…

59:34.329 --> 59:37.456
She's uh… She seems…

59:37.457 --> 59:38.581
Yeah, she seems fine.

59:38.582 --> 59:40.042
Fine?

59:40.043 --> 59:41.960
Fine is good. Fine is positive.

59:41.961 --> 59:43.253
She…

59:43.254 --> 59:45.047
She's fine. She is…

59:45.048 --> 59:46.423
No, no, no. That's not
how you meant it, dawg.

59:46.424 --> 59:48.092
OK, I'm just saying.

59:48.093 --> 59:49.968
Can we just something
positive… happy right now?

59:49.969 --> 59:51.386
OK, like the opposite of sad.

59:51.387 --> 59:54.098
Yeah. No, you're right.

59:54.099 --> 59:55.933
- Let's go to the strip club.
- Can't do that.

59:55.934 --> 59:57.600
Why not?

59:57.601 --> 59:59.520
'Cause that's not how marriage works.

59:59.521 --> 01:00:00.521
Are you sure you know how marriage works?

01:00:00.522 --> 01:00:02.647
All right, look.

01:00:02.648 --> 01:00:04.857
Would your dad go to the strip
club on a random Wednesday?

01:00:04.858 --> 01:00:07.735
No, he avoids my mom by playing
golf three times a week.

01:00:07.736 --> 01:00:09.654
- That's what he do.
- Look. It's like this.

01:00:09.655 --> 01:00:11.490
You spend all your time together.

01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:12.908
Right? Like, you are always together.

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.576
And then if you're not,

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:15.995
you have to tell the other
person where you are.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.747
But you never had a bachelor party.

01:00:19.748 --> 01:00:21.166
- No.
- Yes.

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:22.708
- Nico, no.
- Ah-ha! It is a rule.

01:00:22.709 --> 01:00:24.294
No, no. Fuck, no.

01:00:24.295 --> 01:00:26.922
All husbands must have bachelor parties.

01:00:26.923 --> 01:00:28.631
- No, man.
- Yes.

01:00:28.632 --> 01:00:30.551
- No, no, no, no.
- We are going to the strip club.

01:00:30.552 --> 01:00:32.344
No, no.

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:37.976
<i>♪ I know it ain't for free ♪</i>

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:44.065

01:00:49.653 --> 01:00:53.907
Look at your little baby face.

01:00:53.908 --> 01:00:55.700
Hey.

01:00:55.701 --> 01:00:59.997
Hmm?

01:00:59.998 --> 01:01:02.125
My checkup with Harden is on Thursday.

01:01:06.212 --> 01:01:10.300
I know. It's in my calendar.

01:01:11.426 --> 01:01:15.221
What if it's back?

01:01:20.476 --> 01:01:25.688
It's not back.

01:01:25.689 --> 01:01:27.191
Mia, do you want to go
over the kombucha deck after lunch?

01:01:27.192 --> 01:01:29.318
Yeah, sure.

01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:32.613
Also, how do you feel
about making the presentation?

01:01:32.614 --> 01:01:35.657
- Uh, to you guys?
- To the client.

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:37.118
Really?

01:01:38.036 --> 01:01:38.661
Yeah, you built most of it.

01:01:48.046 --> 01:01:52.217
Um, when is it?

01:02:10.068 --> 01:02:11.944
…It increases brand awareness.

01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:13.528
Having something young and fresh,

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.656
bringing colors in, images, I think…

01:02:15.657 --> 01:02:18.242
So, it was completely clear?

01:02:18.243 --> 01:02:21.453
Yeah, she said it was all good.

01:02:21.454 --> 01:02:22.454
What else did she say?

01:02:22.455 --> 01:02:24.331
Not much.

01:02:24.332 --> 01:02:27.542
You know, she said, "I'll see
you in a couple of months."

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.086
And we talked about her kids a lot.

01:02:29.087 --> 01:02:30.295
Oh, you are so strong.

01:02:30.296 --> 01:02:31.505
The strongest.

01:02:31.506 --> 01:02:33.091
Elliot: one. Cancer: zero.

01:02:34.425 --> 01:02:35.760
Feels like more than one.

01:02:36.970 --> 01:02:39.554
I was just… just making a joke.

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:42.349
Yeah, like ones and zeros. Binary code.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:44.142
Was that it?

01:02:44.143 --> 01:02:46.186
You were making a reference to binary code?

01:02:46.187 --> 01:02:47.896
Yeah. Sort of.

01:02:47.897 --> 01:02:49.439
I'm just trying to deconstruct the joke.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.358
- I know. I know.
- I'm translating…

01:02:51.359 --> 01:02:55.153
That's funny. So, Mia,
what's going on with you?

01:02:55.154 --> 01:02:58.824
Um, I actually did my first
presentation to a client today.

01:02:58.825 --> 01:03:00.993
- And?
- That… that was your big thing?

01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:02.703
It was the presentation.

01:03:02.704 --> 01:03:03.704
Yes.

01:03:03.705 --> 01:03:05.205
Yeah. It was.

01:03:05.206 --> 01:03:07.249
So, how did it go?

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.333
It went really well.

01:03:08.334 --> 01:03:10.460
It was… it was great.

01:03:10.461 --> 01:03:12.879
Good.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.300
Well, there's no better feeling
than to see you two doing so well.

01:03:16.301 --> 01:03:18.261
Now we have so much to celebrate.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:23.432
To you two.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.142
I told you that I was sorry.

01:03:25.143 --> 01:03:26.935
Yeah. In a text.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:28.979
Like, ten minutes before the appointment.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.314
There were more emojis than words.

01:03:30.315 --> 01:03:31.941
It was an opportunity…

01:03:33.234 --> 01:03:35.402
at a job that I actually like.

01:03:35.403 --> 01:03:37.863
Was it more important than finding
out if my cancer's back?

01:03:37.864 --> 01:03:38.990
That's not fair.

01:03:42.535 --> 01:03:43.910
How do you think the bills get paid?

01:03:43.911 --> 01:03:46.079
Out of curiosity.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:48.665
You're the one that said I need
time to get back on my feet.

01:03:48.666 --> 01:03:51.460
Elliot, you sit at home and smoke weed

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:54.464
and play video games, while I go and work.

01:03:55.173 --> 01:03:56.549
I'm sorry. We don't all have
it together like you.

01:03:59.844 --> 01:04:03.055
Your stuff has always come first.

01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:06.433
- That's… that's because I…
- I know. I know.

01:04:06.434 --> 01:04:10.355
I don't regret anything. Of course not.

01:04:11.189 --> 01:04:14.442
I wish I could clone myself and be there
for you every second of every day.

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.861
But I have to focus on my life, too.

01:04:17.862 --> 01:04:21.406
Oh, and I'm… I'm stopping
you from doing that?

01:04:21.407 --> 01:04:25.703
I mean, I never asked you
to put your life on hold.

01:04:25.704 --> 01:04:29.791
You know, and… and just because you
talk in this even tone,

01:04:29.792 --> 01:04:31.793
it doesn't make you right.

01:04:31.794 --> 01:04:33.712
I just want us to be on the same team.

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:43.137
And I just want a real apology.

01:04:44.263 --> 01:04:45.972
I think…

01:04:45.973 --> 01:04:47.683
that maybe you should talk to other people

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:49.018
that have been through this.

01:04:53.231 --> 01:04:57.944
I can't do it by myself.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:06.786
I wish we had another fucking room.

01:05:06.787 --> 01:05:08.787
I mean, it's not exactly easy

01:05:08.788 --> 01:05:10.956
to start dating again, especially
when you have one nut.

01:05:10.957 --> 01:05:14.918
You know, I'm 44. Twice divorced.

01:05:14.919 --> 01:05:17.379
And I just thought you'd
like to know I have one nut.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.548
But… but we can still try and have kids.

01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:22.844
I mean, theoretically, it's possible.
Though…

01:05:22.845 --> 01:05:25.720
one day, they'll probably get
cancer in their nuts, too.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:28.140
…me being on my fucking phone?
Just be aware.

01:05:28.141 --> 01:05:32.854
I don't know what you thought I was gonna
do. It's one day of the year!

01:05:32.855 --> 01:05:36.022
Every time I talk
to my sister, in the back of my mind,

01:05:36.023 --> 01:05:38.984
I'm like, "Fuck you for not
visiting me once."

01:05:38.985 --> 01:05:43.698
But it's a big deal if I miss her
six-year-old's birthday party.

01:05:43.699 --> 01:05:45.365
I had full coverage.

01:05:45.366 --> 01:05:48.828
Somehow, I still got a bill for $98,000

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:51.496
for a single treatment,
which didn't even fucking work.

01:05:51.497 --> 01:05:54.458
- You majored in sociology?
- Yeah.

01:05:54.459 --> 01:05:56.084
You think that could help you sell shoes?

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.879
Yeah. I mean, you know, um…

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.006
being aware of peoples' backgrounds, uh…

01:06:01.007 --> 01:06:02.759
demographic trends.

01:06:05.386 --> 01:06:07.512
Your last job was at a sandwich place.

01:06:07.513 --> 01:06:08.639
Yeah.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.724
I love turkey sandwiches.

01:06:09.725 --> 01:06:11.559
Same. Yeah.

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.936
But that was, uh, a year ago.

01:06:13.937 --> 01:06:16.564
You haven't had a job in the last year?

01:06:16.565 --> 01:06:19.734
No, it's, um, it's been kind
of a weird year.

01:06:19.735 --> 01:06:22.235
- Uh, got married.
- Wow.

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:23.236
Um, yeah.

01:06:23.237 --> 01:06:24.948
Actually, I, uh…

01:06:26.199 --> 01:06:27.199
started building an app.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.283
Cool.

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.410
Can I see it?

01:06:30.411 --> 01:06:32.748
Uh, no, it's… it's not quite ready yet,

01:06:34.332 --> 01:06:37.375
but maybe a couple months.

01:06:37.376 --> 01:06:41.297
Did Mia tell you that she started
to sign two new clients?

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:49.388
No, they're really lucky to have you.

01:06:56.897 --> 01:07:01.692
Oh, God. I'm single as fuck.

01:07:01.693 --> 01:07:04.778
So, uh, what do you do for work, Elliot?

01:07:04.779 --> 01:07:07.239
I don't work.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.825
I'm just kidding. I'm a… I'm
an underwater welder.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:11.409
Really?

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:14.287
Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's, uh, very dangerous.

01:07:14.288 --> 01:07:17.833
But you're… uh, you're feeling OK?
All right?

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.460
Yeah.

01:07:19.461 --> 01:07:21.378
Uh, Mia had said that you'd been sick,

01:07:21.379 --> 01:07:23.714
but that you're in remission now.

01:07:23.715 --> 01:07:25.841
That's what the doctors tell me.

01:07:25.842 --> 01:07:28.219
That's good to hear, man.

01:07:29.555 --> 01:07:30.137
My grandma died of cancer.

01:07:33.809 --> 01:07:35.602
I've got to pee.

01:07:59.166 --> 01:08:02.336
What if I say, "Want
a hand job" right here?

01:08:03.422 --> 01:08:04.548
There's someone.

01:08:06.008 --> 01:08:07.133
Yeah.

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:11.344
She's not gonna care.

01:08:11.345 --> 01:08:13.389
Does that dude
hit on you every day?

01:08:15.224 --> 01:08:19.228
You're not fun.

01:08:27.613 --> 01:08:32.282
What?

01:08:32.283 --> 01:08:33.826
Well, I'm feeling a lot better.

01:08:33.827 --> 01:08:34.952
That's good.

01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:39.082
Can you look up from your phone?

01:08:43.461 --> 01:08:44.502
What?

01:08:44.504 --> 01:08:46.714
You're being a dick.

01:08:46.715 --> 01:08:49.299
Do you know how many times I took
care of you when you were sick?

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.968
I had cancer.

01:08:50.969 --> 01:08:52.510
Mia, you had too many picklebacks.

01:08:52.511 --> 01:08:53.638
It doesn't matter.

01:08:53.639 --> 01:08:55.389
It 100% does matter.

01:08:55.390 --> 01:08:57.474
OK, you're right. It matters.

01:08:57.475 --> 01:08:59.350
Besides, I thought you said you
were done taking care of me.

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:00.769
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.647
You did say that. You said that life

01:09:02.648 --> 01:09:04.523
life rolls on or whatever.

01:09:04.524 --> 01:09:06.273
You know, that you need
to… to focus on yourself.

01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:08.527
No, I said that we both need
to move forward.

01:09:08.528 --> 01:09:10.779
And I'm fucking trying, Mia.

01:09:10.781 --> 01:09:12.572
You know, tonight, one of your coworkers

01:09:12.573 --> 01:09:15.660
said that her grandmother died from cancer?

01:09:15.661 --> 01:09:17.411
I mean, wh… what am
I supposed to do with that?

01:09:17.412 --> 01:09:19.663
You can't blame me
for what other people say.

01:09:19.665 --> 01:09:21.456
Do you know the recurrence rate of Ewing's?

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.794
Do you know the long-term
side-effects of radiation?

01:09:24.795 --> 01:09:26.711
Do you know that the metal plate

01:09:26.712 --> 01:09:28.964
keeping my fucking hips together hurts

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:31.634
every time I stand on it
for more than five minutes.

01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:34.010
Of course I do because I'm
the one that did the research,

01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:36.304
and you're the one that said,
"Fuck statistics."

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:39.975
Whenever anybody looks at me,
all they see is a sick person.

01:09:40.727 --> 01:09:42.395
Because you're not giving
them anything else to see.

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:49.151
Fuck you.

Hey, I've been thinking about you all day.

01:10:43.999 --> 01:10:45.833
…no, I know. We're going to Horse Bar.

01:10:45.834 --> 01:10:47.501
Right now?

01:10:47.502 --> 01:10:49.962
Yes, I want to get a burrito on the way.

01:10:49.963 --> 01:10:53.215
Bro, I just saw
the fattest rat in the bathroom.

01:10:53.216 --> 01:10:54.676
I texted Mikey.

01:11:05.479 --> 01:11:07.062
Uh, your wife just got here.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:08.231
You're married?

01:11:08.232 --> 01:11:09.565
Yeah, he is.

01:11:09.566 --> 01:11:11.317
Mia, what are you doing here?

01:11:11.318 --> 01:11:13.195
Will you come outside for a second?

01:11:16.698 --> 01:11:21.326
Please.

01:11:21.327 --> 01:11:23.204
What? Are you tracking my phone?

01:11:23.205 --> 01:11:24.456
How'd you know where I was?

01:11:25.332 --> 01:11:27.374
You butt dialed me.

01:11:27.375 --> 01:11:29.502
OK. OK?

01:11:29.503 --> 01:11:32.296
OK. What? You… you came all the way
out here to tell me that?

01:11:32.297 --> 01:11:33.965
- See you, Elliot.
- Bye.

01:11:35.467 --> 01:11:37.593
- Who the fuck is that?
- Who knows? Some girl.

01:11:37.594 --> 01:11:40.095
Did you hook up with her?

01:11:40.096 --> 01:11:42.348
If you're gonna make accusations, I'm
gonna go back inside, all right?

01:11:42.349 --> 01:11:44.683
I'm not accusing you. You just did.

01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:46.852
Like how you accused me
of hooking up with David?

01:11:46.853 --> 01:11:48.479
Fuck this.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.730
- Elliot.
- What?! What?

01:11:49.731 --> 01:11:50.898
What?

01:11:50.899 --> 01:11:52.234
Hmm?

01:11:52.235 --> 01:11:54.027
- What are we doing?
- Arguing!

01:11:55.279 --> 01:11:59.616
Again!

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:01.034
We have been through…

01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:10.376
everything together.

01:12:10.377 --> 01:12:12.171
I love you so much.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.424
More than anything on this fucking planet!

01:12:17.592 --> 01:12:19.219
Why?

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.011
Why can't we get through whatever this is?

01:12:21.012 --> 01:12:22.722
Because if I hadn't been sick,

01:12:32.983 --> 01:12:37.028
I never would've asked you to marry me.

01:12:59.885 --> 01:13:01.677
And you put in your emotions…

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:04.805
Uh, you put in your…

01:13:04.806 --> 01:13:09.227
your… your financial,
you know, prospects.

01:13:09.228 --> 01:13:12.147
Um, you know, if you're PMS-ing or…

01:13:12.148 --> 01:13:13.856
If I'm PMS-ing?

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:15.024
You wanna come home with me?

01:13:15.025 --> 01:13:16.525
Uh, no.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:18.320
Well, I can come home with you because

01:13:18.321 --> 01:13:19.862
I'm actually crashing
on a couch right now, so.

01:13:19.863 --> 01:13:21.114
Oh, it's still a no.

01:13:21.115 --> 01:13:22.616
Thanks for the drink, though.

01:13:24.618 --> 01:13:26.786
Hey, wh… where are you going?

01:13:35.045 --> 01:13:39.549
Hey… girl.

01:14:16.628 --> 01:14:18.837
Hey. Wanna grab a coffee?

01:14:18.838 --> 01:14:21.299
Um…

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:22.883
You know, I've got… I've got a lot

01:14:22.884 --> 01:14:24.094
of work to do, so.

01:14:24.095 --> 01:14:26.221
OK.

01:14:26.222 --> 01:14:28.931
It's kind of blatant
how you're avoiding me.

01:14:28.932 --> 01:14:31.976
Yeah, about that. Um…

01:14:31.977 --> 01:14:34.770
You know, I think that that was like a…
like a one time thing.

01:14:34.771 --> 01:14:37.773
And, you know, I think that,
you know, you're so smart,

01:14:37.774 --> 01:14:40.276
and… and we work together,
and you're such a great boss.

01:14:40.277 --> 01:14:42.903
Not that I want to acknowledge
that you're my boss right now, but I…

01:14:42.904 --> 01:14:44.447
Mia, I agree.

01:14:44.448 --> 01:14:46.657
- Oh, you do.
- Yeah.

01:14:46.658 --> 01:14:49.120
And I'm kind of seeing someone
right now, so we're good.

01:14:50.829 --> 01:14:53.331
- Oh.
- Let's just focus on the work

01:14:53.332 --> 01:14:55.375
and try not to make things awkward.

01:14:55.376 --> 01:14:56.792
Definitely.

01:14:56.793 --> 01:14:59.421
On the same page.

01:14:59.422 --> 01:15:01.922
Just gonna… I'll just get
back on to the work.

01:15:01.923 --> 01:15:03.800
Keep on doing what you're doing.

01:15:05.719 --> 01:15:11.182
- Yes.
- All right.

01:15:11.183 --> 01:15:13.393
…Is not
a current rate of emissions.

01:15:13.394 --> 01:15:15.561
No, it's all emissions we've caused so far.

01:15:15.562 --> 01:15:17.439
So, you guys moved off murder docs, huh?

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.442
Global warming is still murder.

01:15:22.193 --> 01:15:26.530
Yeah, it's just murder
of the natural world.

01:15:26.531 --> 01:15:28.199
And that's Lauren.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.410
She lives in your old room.

01:15:30.411 --> 01:15:32.704
Yeah, and she eats corndogs
and leaves the sticks everywhere.

01:15:32.997 --> 01:15:34.498
- It's so gross.
- So disgusting.

01:15:37.084 --> 01:15:39.044
Can I, uh…

01:15:39.045 --> 01:15:40.296
Could I hit that?

01:15:42.506 --> 01:15:44.507
Inhale. Inhale. Inhale.

01:15:44.508 --> 01:15:45.633
Yes! Now lift it.

01:15:46.634 --> 01:15:48.595
Yes!

01:15:55.144 --> 01:15:56.603
You've been smoking
and drinking excessively?

01:15:57.896 --> 01:15:59.314
Sometimes.

01:15:59.315 --> 01:16:01.607
What the fuck?

01:16:01.608 --> 01:16:04.902
I… I didn't know doctors could
say "fuck" to their patients.

01:16:04.903 --> 01:16:07.738
We can when the patient
is behaving like an idiot.

01:16:07.739 --> 01:16:10.241
I… look, can you give me
any medical information?

01:16:10.242 --> 01:16:13.745
Your esophagus is inflamed and irritated.

01:16:15.914 --> 01:16:21.044
- That's all?
- That's all.

01:16:21.045 --> 01:16:23.296
I don't know if the cancer
is going to come back.

01:16:23.297 --> 01:16:27.008
I can only imagine how that weighs on you.

01:16:27.009 --> 01:16:31.179
But everything's uncertain every day.

01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:34.349
You've fought really hard
to make your body whole again.

01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:36.559
What does Mia say about all this?

01:16:39.271 --> 01:16:40.980
Congrats on actually looking
like your profile picture.

01:16:40.981 --> 01:16:42.941
Uh…

01:16:42.942 --> 01:16:45.401
- I'm just… I'm just being honest.
- You, too.

01:16:45.402 --> 01:16:49.738
I, uh… I hate how we all act
like we don't do these things

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:52.909
- just based on a bunch of pictures.
- Yeah.

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:54.494
Yeah. No, I… I guess that's true.

01:16:54.495 --> 01:16:56.329
Yeah, I, uh… I normally swipe left, so…

01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:58.622
Too many ripped dudes at the beach,

01:16:58.623 --> 01:17:00.707
bumping the saturation.

01:17:00.708 --> 01:17:03.337
Exactly.

01:17:03.837 --> 01:17:08.007
This is, uh… this is actually
my first Tinder date.

01:17:08.008 --> 01:17:09.259
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:10.885
I am honored, then.

01:17:10.886 --> 01:17:14.638
I mean, I had an account before, but, um…

01:17:14.639 --> 01:17:16.474
looked at it more conceptually.

01:17:16.475 --> 01:17:20.186
What made you look at it,
uh, not conceptually?

01:17:20.187 --> 01:17:22.188
Oh, you know, a break up.

01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:23.689
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:24.816
Me, too.

01:17:25.817 --> 01:17:27.527
Yeah.

01:17:27.528 --> 01:17:30.114
So, uh, wh… what happened?

01:17:31.365 --> 01:17:33.366
I don't know. Um…

01:17:33.367 --> 01:17:35.951
So, you're from, uh… you're
from Minnesota, right?

01:17:35.952 --> 01:17:39.289
- Nice pivot.
- Thank you.

01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:42.250
Listen, why don't we just
stop this first date stuff,

01:17:42.251 --> 01:17:46.045
and just kind of,
like maybe, I don't know…

01:17:46.046 --> 01:17:47.714
it's like the fourth date?

01:17:48.382 --> 01:17:48.841
Can we just do that?

01:17:52.428 --> 01:17:53.678
OK. Uh…

01:17:55.306 --> 01:17:56.598
Well, I was married.

01:17:56.599 --> 01:17:58.933
OK.

01:17:58.934 --> 01:18:01.186
Well, if you don't feel comfortable,
you don't have to tell me

01:18:01.187 --> 01:18:04.439
the reason why, and we can
just talk about…

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.483
Minnesota.

01:18:08.068 --> 01:18:13.072
No, I… I was really married.

01:18:13.073 --> 01:18:15.491
Wait, aren't you…
aren't you like, uh, 23?

01:18:15.492 --> 01:18:16.784
Yup.

01:18:19.163 --> 01:18:20.746
You were married at what? Like, 19?

01:18:20.747 --> 01:18:23.750
And then divorced at 20, 22?

01:18:24.627 --> 01:18:26.921
I…

01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:32.049
I guess, technically,
I'm… I'm still married?

01:18:32.050 --> 01:18:35.512
Uh, but we're not… we're not together

01:18:37.932 --> 01:18:42.228
or anything.

01:18:43.604 --> 01:18:47.357
Oh. Um…

01:18:47.358 --> 01:18:49.652
Yeah, you might want to put
that, uh, on your profile.

01:18:52.196 --> 01:18:54.280
Andy's not in here.

01:18:54.281 --> 01:18:56.866
How did you find out about it?

01:18:56.867 --> 01:18:59.035
Let her answer the question.

01:18:59.036 --> 01:19:00.828
Andy is your brother.

01:19:00.829 --> 01:19:02.914
And he was born with you. He was your twin,

01:19:02.915 --> 01:19:06.376
and he got an infection, and he died.

01:19:06.377 --> 01:19:07.794
Bullshit.

01:19:07.795 --> 01:19:10.089
He was so happy…

01:19:30.818 --> 01:19:35.280
He was so happy.

01:19:39.451 --> 01:19:41.703
…as they battle
it out in the ring.

01:19:41.704 --> 01:19:44.038
Oh, look at the struggle. Cherokee man…

01:19:44.039 --> 01:19:46.124
You know how it's, like,
so stressful to find

01:19:46.125 --> 01:19:47.959
a show you wanna watch
because there's so many choices.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.378
What if we build this thing for your phone

01:19:50.379 --> 01:19:52.505
where you just shake it, you know?

01:19:52.506 --> 01:19:54.257
And it just spits out a title.

01:19:54.258 --> 01:19:56.174
Like, boom! You're watching Gossip Girl.

01:19:56.175 --> 01:19:57.302
Mm-mmm. That already exists.

01:19:57.303 --> 01:19:58.721
Really?

01:19:58.722 --> 01:20:00.930
What if we go back to Instajizz?

01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:03.057
Nah, fuck Instajizz, man.

01:20:03.058 --> 01:20:05.226
Hey, bro. Don't shit
on my trillion dollar ideas, OK?

01:20:05.227 --> 01:20:06.770
Oh, yeah? If they were
trillion dollar ideas,

01:20:06.771 --> 01:20:09.230
how come we never built them?

01:20:09.231 --> 01:20:11.399
Because a) I'm ahead of my time, and you
never truly understood my vision.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.359
And b) coding is hard.

01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:16.362
And c) we just never really
cared that much about it.

01:20:16.363 --> 01:20:18.323
You know, it was just cool to sound
like we were entrepreneurs.

01:20:18.324 --> 01:20:19.701
At least we got our dicks sucked.

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.204
Although, no one ever sucked my dick

01:20:25.205 --> 01:20:26.205
because of Instajizz.

01:20:26.206 --> 01:20:27.958
Oh, they sucked mine.

01:20:28.668 --> 01:20:29.501
It's 'cause you got gentle eyes.

01:20:32.797 --> 01:20:34.547
Except Mia.

01:20:34.548 --> 01:20:35.758
Mia never sucked your dick?

01:20:35.759 --> 01:20:37.634
No, she did.

01:20:39.721 --> 01:20:41.305
Um… No, but it wasn't
'cause of the bullshit.

01:20:44.224 --> 01:20:46.100
So, where's the redhead?

01:20:46.101 --> 01:20:49.437
Yo, can you please start
calling her Morgan now?

01:20:49.438 --> 01:20:50.980
OK? We're, like, full on dating.

01:20:50.981 --> 01:20:52.858
You called Mia "ham and cheese."

01:20:54.276 --> 01:20:55.402
My bad.

01:20:58.364 --> 01:21:00.491
Have you talked to her at all?

01:21:02.451 --> 01:21:06.455
No. Why would she want to talk to me?

01:21:07.581 --> 01:21:09.248
Uh…

01:21:09.249 --> 01:21:11.543
I don't really know how to…
how to do this.

01:21:12.670 --> 01:21:14.045
Um…

01:21:14.046 --> 01:21:16.840
Honestly, I feel very, very self-conscious.

01:21:16.841 --> 01:21:17.966
You know, being here.

01:21:19.927 --> 01:21:20.927
But hi.

01:21:20.928 --> 01:21:22.221
I'm Elliot.

01:21:24.098 --> 01:21:26.432
I don't wanna talk about cancer.

01:21:26.433 --> 01:21:28.226
You know, I'm… I'm… I'm sick…

01:21:28.227 --> 01:21:29.353
of talking about it.

01:21:30.896 --> 01:21:33.272
And…

01:21:33.273 --> 01:21:35.859
You know, even just then,
using the word, "sick,"

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:38.153
it's like, fuck.

01:21:39.279 --> 01:21:41.280
Um…

01:21:41.281 --> 01:21:44.451
But it's the word that I say the most now,

01:21:54.211 --> 01:21:58.507
and I just… I wanna get away from it.

01:22:36.086 --> 01:22:40.382
Nope.

01:22:48.015 --> 01:22:49.432
Hello?

01:22:49.433 --> 01:22:50.642
Hey.

01:22:50.643 --> 01:22:52.018
Hey.

01:22:52.019 --> 01:22:53.646
Um, I was just about to call you.

01:22:55.063 --> 01:22:57.232
You… You did just call me.

01:22:59.026 --> 01:23:02.154
Yeah. No, you're… you're right.
I… because I did.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.072
So, not a butt dial?

01:23:05.073 --> 01:23:07.702
No. No, no, no.

01:23:09.829 --> 01:23:11.664
I've been thinking about,
you know, calling you, too.

01:23:13.875 --> 01:23:15.415
Oh, yeah?

01:23:15.416 --> 01:23:17.879
Yeah.

01:23:18.253 --> 01:23:20.380
Would you maybe wanna get
together some time soon?

01:23:40.192 --> 01:23:41.192
Hey.

01:23:41.193 --> 01:23:43.070
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:43.278 --> 01:23:44.697
Hi.

01:23:47.449 --> 01:23:48.617
You look good.

01:23:48.618 --> 01:23:49.786
Oh, thank you.

01:23:51.119 --> 01:23:52.119
Uh…

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:53.623
I'll just…

01:23:55.625 --> 01:23:56.960
You're welcome.

01:23:58.085 --> 01:23:59.711
You do, too.

01:23:59.712 --> 01:24:01.254
I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

01:24:01.255 --> 01:24:02.965
That's all right.

01:24:02.966 --> 01:24:04.383
Uh…

01:24:05.593 --> 01:24:06.760
How are you?

01:24:06.761 --> 01:24:08.344
All right.

01:24:08.345 --> 01:24:09.972
Good.

01:24:09.973 --> 01:24:11.389
You seeing anybody?

01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:14.476
Sorry, I just, um… I had to…

01:24:14.477 --> 01:24:17.854
get that out there before my brain
was gonna explode.

01:24:17.855 --> 01:24:20.356
No. No, I'm not seeing anyone.
Your brain can relax.

01:24:20.357 --> 01:24:22.275
Cool.

01:24:22.276 --> 01:24:23.945
Okay.

01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:27.447
- Why? Are you?
- No.

01:24:27.448 --> 01:24:30.617
Both, uh, single. Single and married.
Ha-ha.

01:24:30.618 --> 01:24:32.578
Yeah, I, um, I keep telling people

01:24:32.579 --> 01:24:34.914
I've got the Benjamin Button disease.

01:24:37.875 --> 01:24:42.004
I'm 24, but I've already had
cancer, a wife, and a separation.

01:24:42.005 --> 01:24:44.965
I miss you.

01:24:44.966 --> 01:24:46.674
I feel like I had to…

01:24:46.675 --> 01:24:48.051
get that out there, too.

01:24:48.052 --> 01:24:49.678
Elliot, um…

01:24:49.679 --> 01:24:52.222
What? You don't… you don't miss me?

01:24:53.725 --> 01:24:55.391
Of course I miss you.

01:24:55.392 --> 01:24:58.812
That's good 'cause I feel like, uh…

01:24:58.813 --> 01:25:01.522
I feel like we should try again.

01:25:01.523 --> 01:25:03.066
You know, I'm… I'm not, uh…

01:25:03.067 --> 01:25:05.151
high, drunk all the time.

01:25:05.152 --> 01:25:06.778
Actually, um…

01:25:06.779 --> 01:25:08.530
I've been going to the support group.

01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:09.531
Dope.

01:25:09.532 --> 01:25:12.034
Dope? Since, uh…

01:25:12.035 --> 01:25:15.328
Since when do you say shit like dope?

01:25:15.329 --> 01:25:18.874
I… I don't. I don't really
know why I just said that.

01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:21.250
Anyway, um, got my old job back.

01:25:21.251 --> 01:25:23.670
You know, while I figure
out the next thing…

01:25:23.671 --> 01:25:25.296
which I know is not programming.

01:25:25.297 --> 01:25:26.758
I'm really happy for you.

01:25:31.054 --> 01:25:35.975
Um…

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.522
But… but I th… I think
we should get a divorce.

01:25:43.523 --> 01:25:44.651
Um…

01:25:46.903 --> 01:25:48.029
OK.

01:25:50.573 --> 01:25:51.990
Yeah.

01:25:51.991 --> 01:25:54.117
Yeah? Yeah.

01:25:54.118 --> 01:25:56.036
You know, we don't need
the, uh… the label…

01:25:56.037 --> 01:25:58.080
or whatever.

01:25:58.081 --> 01:26:01.415
I mean, that's when things
started getting weird, anyway.

01:26:01.416 --> 01:26:04.419
And we can go back to just
being a-a normal couple.

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.254
You know, just 'cause you're my ex-wife

01:26:06.631 --> 01:26:08.132
doesn't mean you can't
be my girlfriend, right?

01:26:11.175 --> 01:26:12.804
What you said outside the bar…

01:26:13.012 --> 01:26:15.932
I know. I know. I, um…

01:26:17.141 --> 01:26:18.933
I fucked up.

01:26:18.934 --> 01:26:20.852
We both fucked up.

01:26:20.853 --> 01:26:22.854
Well, I, uh…

01:26:22.855 --> 01:26:24.940
I take it back.

01:26:24.941 --> 01:26:26.734
You don't have to take it back.

01:26:32.115 --> 01:26:36.826
You said what we both didn't want to admit.

01:26:36.827 --> 01:26:38.371
It's not that I don't love you.

01:26:39.539 --> 01:26:40.706
I do love you.

01:26:40.707 --> 01:26:42.082
You're my first love.

01:26:42.083 --> 01:26:43.208
I…

01:26:44.335 --> 01:26:46.629
I just don't…

01:26:49.132 --> 01:26:53.302
I just don't know if you're my only love.

01:26:54.429 --> 01:26:58.265
You're mine.

01:27:14.615 --> 01:27:18.951
You can't know that.

01:27:18.952 --> 01:27:20.955
Can I have a real hug?

01:27:29.213 --> 01:27:33.300
Yeah.

01:27:43.311 --> 01:27:47.314
Thank you.

01:27:47.315 --> 01:27:48.774
Sorry.

01:27:48.775 --> 01:27:49.900
It happens.

01:27:49.901 --> 01:27:51.443
Yeah.

01:27:57.242 --> 01:28:01.536
I'm gonna stand over here now, OK?

01:28:01.537 --> 01:28:03.122
I guess I should go.

01:28:04.499 --> 01:28:06.125
Bye, Mia.

01:28:08.836 --> 01:28:10.337
Oh, where are you…?

01:28:10.338 --> 01:28:12.464
The L.

01:28:12.465 --> 01:28:14.217
The G.

01:28:14.218 --> 01:28:15.593
Same stop.

01:28:18.513 --> 01:28:20.430
Yeah, you can… you can
walk in front of me.

01:28:20.431 --> 01:28:22.475
It would make it less weird.

01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:24.309
That would probably be more weird.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.815
Hey, you could wear your headphones?

01:28:30.316 --> 01:28:31.691
I don't have my headphones.

01:28:31.692 --> 01:28:33.360
Really?

01:28:33.361 --> 01:28:36.405
You know, I just talk to the people.

01:28:36.948 --> 01:28:38.574
Really take in that New York texture.

01:28:41.661 --> 01:28:43.119
Maybe. Maybe I can get that hand job?

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.746
What?!

01:28:44.747 --> 01:28:47.208
You remember? The time on the train.

01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:48.834
Yes.

01:28:48.835 --> 01:28:50.044
I was drunk.

01:28:51.796 --> 01:28:53.338
