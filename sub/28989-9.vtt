(HARVEY READING)

00:02.294 --> 00:03.375
FAYE: If you want me gone,

00:03.462 --> 00:05.169
convince me you people
can be trusted to fly right.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.290
And if we don't?

00:06.381 --> 00:07.712
If you continue
to cross lines,

00:07.799 --> 00:08.880
then you'll be fired.

00:08.967 --> 00:09.957
You lied to me.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.886
All I did was produce a piece of evidence
that proves exactly what we know he did.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.053
You didn't produce I,
you fabricated it

00:16.140 --> 00:18.553
because you can't stand
someone getting the better of you.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.100
She is never gonna
stop coming.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.270
Zane's name, Louis's
title, Samantha's job...

00:23.357 --> 00:25.018
How could you
betray Harvey like that?

00:25.108 --> 00:26.690
I didn't betray anyone.
Bullshit!

00:26.777 --> 00:28.359
You hide behind morality

00:28.445 --> 00:30.732
when the truth is,
you just can't stand Harvey.

00:30.822 --> 00:33.439
He won't change, and
he's a cancer to this firm.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.526
My mom cheated on my dad
for most of my life.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.779
I knew it, and I kept
it a secret from him.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.864
Do you remember the time we
won the Little League championship?

00:41.959 --> 00:43.199
I walked off the field,

00:43.293 --> 00:45.034
and it was supposed to be
you and Dad, and...

00:45.128 --> 00:46.118
He wasn't there.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.921
I was so mad at you
for telling me he'd be there.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.715
I'm sorry it took me
so long to forgive you.

00:51.802 --> 00:53.384
Harvey, I need
to tell you something.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.460
What is it, Donna?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.966
Your mother had
a heart attack.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.046
She's gone.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.975
(SPECTATORS CHEERING)

01:01.645 --> 01:03.727
You got this, Harvey!

01:08.485 --> 01:09.646
Yeah!

01:12.948 --> 01:13.938

LILY: Can I get your
autograph? Where's Dad?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.834
Oh, sweetheart.
He wanted to be here.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.669
You said
he would be here.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.299
Harvey, his gig got
extended last night

01:38.390 --> 01:40.631
and I didn't want
to tell you before the game.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.433
So you lied and pretended
he was gonna be here

01:42.519 --> 01:43.725
when you knew he wasn't?

01:43.812 --> 01:45.678
Harvey, stop.
That was the most important

01:45.772 --> 01:47.638
game of my life,
and he wasn't here.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.644
And he feels
horrible about it,

01:49.735 --> 01:52.022
but your dad is working
his butt off for us.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.400
So what? I just played
the best I ever have,

01:55.490 --> 01:56.776
and every time I looked up,

01:56.867 --> 01:59.199
the only person
I could see was you.

01:59.286 --> 02:01.368
How could you
do that to me?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.664
I'm doing the best
I can, Harvey.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.869
None of us are perfect.
Yeah, well, I was today.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.629
Now it's all ruined
because of you!

(MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING)

02:23.769 --> 02:25.555
HARVEY: I always
loved baseball.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.850
I got it from my dad.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.724
He taught me everything,
how to pitch, how to hit.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.354
An hour in the batting cage

02:33.445 --> 02:36.358
was my favorite way
of spending an afternoon.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.440
Which is why, until recently,
whenever I thought about baseball,

02:39.534 --> 02:41.195
I always thought of him.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.615
But the truth is...

02:47.167 --> 02:50.159
It was my mom that took me
to every practice,

02:51.755 --> 02:54.372
cheered me on every game.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.048
Never missed a second.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.337
She was always there,

03:01.431 --> 03:03.718
even when
I thought she wasn't.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.509
I didn't know that
for a long time.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.469
But now I do.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.733
She used to tell me that
none of us were perfect,

03:18.824 --> 03:20.406
that we all
made mistakes.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.070
But she always
owned hers.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.871
She taught us
about right and wrong

03:27.958 --> 03:29.869
and forgiveness.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.623
I just have so many things
I wish I could say to you...

03:36.675 --> 03:39.542
Things I should
have said a long time ago.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.763

it took me so long.

where there is wrong,
forgiveness.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.955
It was a beautiful
eulogy, Harvey.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.501
She would have loved it.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.009
Mike, thanks for coming.
Yeah, of course.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.760
Listen, Harvey...

04:27.476 --> 04:29.592
About what I said the
last time I was here...

04:29.686 --> 04:31.017
Don't worry about it.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.936
You being here now
says everything.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.266
Harvey, I think
Marcus needs you.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.776
Yeah.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.866
All right, give it to me
straight, Donna.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.442
How's he really doing?

04:47.537 --> 04:50.529
To tell you the truth, this couldn't
have come at a worse time.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.248
You mean because of the
Faye thing? I mean his family

04:53.335 --> 04:54.825
has been shattered,
and at the same time,

04:54.920 --> 04:57.161
this woman has been
dismantling his other family.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.996
And, Mike,
she's never gonna stop.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.459
Don't tell me you have
an idea of how to fix that.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.887
I do. You've obviously forgiven
Harvey for what happened on that case.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.556
But the question is,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.054
can you forgive everyone?

05:22.155 --> 05:23.395
It's just us now.

05:23.490 --> 05:28.200
I knew it had to come
sometime, but I just wasn't ready.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.323
I know.
We were making plans.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.573
Talking about her
coming to meet Donna.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.908
She would have
loved her, Harvey.

Hey, I didn't just call you
in here to have a beer.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.261
I found this
on Mom's desk.

05:47.347 --> 05:52.057

around to mailing it before...

I didn't look.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.518
Oh...

06:06.116 --> 06:08.778
Say, why don't you stick
around for a few days?

06:10.662 --> 06:13.324
I appreciate that, Marcus.
I think I got to get home.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.663
I get it.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.704
I love you, Marcus.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.748
I've never seen
Harvey like that.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.176
It was terrible circumstances,
but all the same,

06:28.263 --> 06:29.753
it was touching.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.840
Maybe, but for me,

06:32.934 --> 06:34.766
I don't ever want to see
Superman laid low.

06:35.604 --> 06:36.810

Mike.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.605
Hey, good to see you.
It's great to see you.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.733
Listen, you mind giving
Samantha and I a minute?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.982
No, of course not.
Thanks.

06:52.329 --> 06:53.785
I heard you lost
your job.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.332
Samantha, I never wanted that
to happen, and I'm sorry that it did.

06:58.418 --> 07:01.786
Yeah, well, if I had
known then what I know now,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.212
I would have
done things differently.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.090
Of course, that doesn't
change the fact

07:07.177 --> 07:09.088
that I'm still
on the outside looking in.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.883
Well, maybe we should
do something about that.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.054
What are you
talking about?

07:13.141 --> 07:16.133
Donna told me how miserable
everyone is at work.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.093
She also said that
there's no one better

07:18.188 --> 07:21.397
to get rid of Faye
than us.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.850
What did you have in mind?
I don't know.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.606
But if you're willing to
bury the hatchet,

07:26.696 --> 07:30.815
I'm pretty sure the two of us can come up
with something to send that woman packing.

breakfast? I'm okay, Donna.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.897
You don't need
to stay here with me.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.111
Besides, Faye probably
has some rule about

08:14.244 --> 08:15.734
how many days
a person can miss.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.365
I don't want you
in her crosshairs.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.696
I don't care about her
rules. It's not her firm.

08:19.791 --> 08:20.826
Could have fooled me.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.954
I know you don't
mean that.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.126
And with any luck,

08:25.213 --> 08:27.329
Faye won't be at the firm
much longer at all.

No one needs to see
those pajamas.

should see what Louis wears.

Come on, what are you
really doing here?

08:43.898 --> 08:46.060
Look, after Grammy died,
I was in a bad place

08:46.151 --> 08:47.562
and you really helped me
through it.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.768
I'm just here
to return the favor.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.853
What do you mean?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.062
He means what
could be better

08:52.157 --> 08:54.740
than watching the woman who's
been making our lives miserable

08:54.826 --> 08:57.113
finally get what's
coming to her?

08:57.203 --> 08:59.319
You put him up
to this, didn't you?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.743
Well, at least I didn't put him
up to pretending to be a lawyer.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.289
Oh, God.
Too soon?

09:03.376 --> 09:04.992
Right on time. Why
don't you two sidekicks

09:05.086 --> 09:07.623
wait here while I put on my
Batsuit and you can fill me in?

09:07.714 --> 09:08.704
Sidekicks?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.004
You're the one who called
yourself Robin.

Would you prefer I said

"grown man who
wears underwear

"and calls himself
a superhero"?

09:14.929 --> 09:17.591
What?
Nothing, it's just...

09:17.682 --> 09:18.672
Good to see you being

09:18.767 --> 09:19.802
a douche again, Harvey.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.258
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

Gretchen.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.649
I was just...
Taking care of

09:29.736 --> 09:31.022
whatever work
you could for Harvey,

09:31.112 --> 09:32.648
just like you've
been doing all week.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.195
I didn't think
anyone knew.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.693
I knew because I've been

09:35.784 --> 09:36.945
doing the same thing.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.025
I told Donna

09:38.119 --> 09:39.575
I'd keep track of things
while they were away,

09:39.662 --> 09:41.027
so they wouldn't
have to worry.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.237
And so you wouldn't

09:42.332 --> 09:44.619
feel guilty about avoiding
the whole thing.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.286
I'm not very good
at funerals.

09:48.379 --> 09:51.417
Besides, what could
I possibly say?

09:51.508 --> 09:54.216
You're saying everything
you need to right here, Katrina.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.545
And trust me, when Harvey
gets back, he'll hear it.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.300
Thanks, Gretchen.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.896
Surprise, surprise. Even
your coffee is uptight.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.349
Samantha, security didn't
alert me you were coming.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.025
MIKE: That's because
she's my guest.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.568
Or should I say
my client?

10:13.655 --> 10:15.487
And who are you?
Name's Mike Ross.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.654
I know you've heard of me,
so why don't we

10:16.741 --> 10:19.278
skip the introductions
and jump right to the suing?

10:19.369 --> 10:21.110
Excuse me?
I'm suing you

10:21.204 --> 10:22.990
for wrongful termination.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.495
I see what's going on.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.165
This isn't a lawsuit.
It's a ploy to get me out.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.583
You're damn right
it's gonna get you out,

10:28.670 --> 10:31.537
because you abused your
power when you took my job.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.338
I had every right
to take your job.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.085
We both know what you did.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.883
You have no proof
she did anything.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.381
Well, I don't believe
for one second

10:38.471 --> 10:40.053
she's innocent,
and neither do you.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.472
So you two can try and make
me look bad all you want...

10:42.559 --> 10:45.096
Don't you dare
play the victim, Faye.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.848
You came in here and
took Robert's reputation,

10:47.939 --> 10:50.306
Louis' dignity,
and my everything.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.975
You have been judge,
jury, and executioner

10:53.069 --> 10:55.026
from the moment
you got here.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.526
Well, now I'm gonna make sure
one of us finally gets our day in court.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.283
Harvey.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.828
You're back.
I am, Louis.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.960
There's about to be some fireworks,
and I don't want to miss them.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.040
What do you mean,
fireworks?

11:17.135 --> 11:18.500
Mike and Samantha
made peace.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.927
Then they followed it up
with something even better.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.472
They're filing a wrongful
termination suit against Faye.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.969
Holy shit.
That's right.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.426
They win, she's gone.
Harvey, this is great.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.681
When are they gonna
slap her with it?

11:28.813 --> 11:31.976
My guess is, they just
did. FAYE: Louis, Harvey.

11:32.066 --> 11:33.477
I was sorry to hear
about your mother.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.775
Please accept my...
Keep your condolences, Faye.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.603
You don't give a shit
about me or my mom.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.904
So why don't you get
to why you're really here?

11:39.991 --> 11:44.110
All right, Samantha is suing
me for wrongful termination,

11:44.204 --> 11:45.444
and Mike Ross
is defending her.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.370
Wait a second.

11:48.124 --> 11:52.459
Louis, didn't she fire
Samantha without any evidence?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.831
Well, now that
you mention it,

11:53.922 --> 11:56.539
that does seem to meet the
criteria for wrongful termination, yeah.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.873
It sure does.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.332
Sounds like you're
screwed, Faye,

11:59.427 --> 12:00.917
because you got no defense.

12:01.012 --> 12:04.380
Yes, I do, because you two
are going to represent me.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.260
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.841
And if you think
you can order us to...

12:07.936 --> 12:09.426
I'm not ordering.
I'm dealing.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.010
I don't make deals
with the devil.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.142
I'm well aware
how you feel about me.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.816
But if you can feel that
way, defend me, and win,

12:15.902 --> 12:17.358
I'll know
my job here is done.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.981
Bullshit, your back's
against the wall.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.358
You'd promise anything
to get us to agree.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.110
And whatever else you might
think, you know I keep my word.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.327
This is your chance.
Win, and I'll go.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.825
But let me be clear,
no colluding,

12:29.916 --> 12:31.122
no telling the other side
about this,

12:31.209 --> 12:32.199
and if you cheat,

12:32.293 --> 12:34.910
I'll go to the Bar
and tell them this firm

12:35.004 --> 12:36.836
should be dismantled
permanently.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.005
No deal.
Your decision.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.550
But if I go to someone
else, their strategy

12:41.636 --> 12:44.219
is going to be to prove
Samantha crossed a line.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.047
You handle this, as long
as it's on the up-and-up,

12:47.141 --> 12:49.132
you can use whatever
strategy you want.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.308
LOUIS: What are we
supposed to tell them?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.510
They'd never believe
that we'd represent you.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.140
I don't care
what you tell them

12:53.231 --> 12:56.098
as long as you don't tell
them about this agreement.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.478
But you better think
of something soon,

12:57.568 --> 12:59.275
because I filed
a motion to dismiss

12:59.362 --> 13:02.900
and I will have someone
in chambers this afternoon.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.532
I am not representing
that woman.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.655
You think I want to?
They filed that suit.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.861
We're in this, and we
have no other choice.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.994
I'll tell you the choice. We tell
Mike and Samantha to drop this,

13:13.084 --> 13:15.542
claim victory to Faye, and
send her fucking packing.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.960
Harvey, you heard her.
If we say anything

13:18.047 --> 13:19.629
and Faye finds out,
you can forget about Samantha

13:19.716 --> 13:22.174
getting her job back
or getting rid of Faye

13:22.302 --> 13:25.215
because this firm is done.
All right, we don't tell them.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.093
But if you think I'm gonna keep this
from Donna, you're out of your mind.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.640
Keep what from me?
Donna, brace yourself.

13:30.727 --> 13:35.016
We have some things to tell
you, most important of which is...

13:35.106 --> 13:36.392
We're representing Faye.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.396
Let me get
this straight.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.107
You're telling me Samantha
filed suit to get Faye out,

13:47.201 --> 13:48.407
Faye went to Harvey
and Louis to defend her,

13:48.494 --> 13:49.655
and if they
don't win,

13:49.746 --> 13:51.202
we'll be stuck with her
till hell freezes over?

13:51.289 --> 13:52.700
That is what
I'm telling you.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.076
But you can't tell
another soul.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.625
Because if Mike and Samantha
tank the case, we're all finished.

13:56.711 --> 13:57.997
So she says.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.248
What do you mean,
so she says?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.545
That's why I'm here.
I need you to find out

14:00.631 --> 14:01.962
if Faye can really
take us down.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.381
What are you talking about?
Of course she can.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.209
How do you know that?
Because she said she can.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.384
Well, that doesn't
mean that...

14:06.471 --> 14:08.678
Donna, the woman is a lot of
things, but a liar isn't one of them.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.177
Damn it, Alex, do you think
that I don't know that?

14:12.727 --> 14:13.842
Okay.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.350
What's really going on?

14:17.857 --> 14:22.192
Harvey says he can
do this, Alex, but...

14:22.987 --> 14:24.443
I'm afraid
that right now...

14:24.530 --> 14:26.396
He's not in the right frame of
mind for something like this.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.152
And I don't think
he has any idea.

14:29.786 --> 14:33.154
All right,
I'll look into it, but...

14:33.247 --> 14:35.614
I don't think you're
gonna like what I find out.

14:37.168 --> 14:40.377
Your Honor, if Faye Richardson
can't even bother to show up

14:40.463 --> 14:42.795
to defend a motion she filed,
then I move to dismiss...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.624
Faye Richardson won't be
defending anything. We will.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.006
Is this some kind of joke?
HARVEY: No, it's not.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.466
But your lawsuit is.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.546
Harvey Specter
and Louis Litt

14:51.641 --> 14:52.756
for the defense,
Your Honor.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.386
Your Honor, my client and I
need to have a moment...

14:54.477 --> 14:55.683
No, I don't need a
moment to do anything.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.099
Samantha... No, I don't
know what's going on here,

14:58.189 --> 15:00.521
but if Faye thought I would fold
just because she sent you two,

15:00.608 --> 15:01.769
she's got another
thing coming.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.145
And what you have coming
is a dismissal,

15:03.236 --> 15:04.351
because our client had
every right to fire you.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.606
SAMANTHA: Bullshit,
she accused me

15:05.696 --> 15:07.983
of crossing the line
with zero evidence.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.406
She didn't need evidence
because our bylaws say

15:10.493 --> 15:12.655
the managing partner
can terminate anyone

15:12.745 --> 15:14.110
for any reason,
without cause.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.071
You have proof of this?
Right here.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.829
Then I have no choice
but to dismiss the case.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.206
Except for one thing,
Your Honor.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.958
The bylaw you just entered
was from page 72, paragraph 3.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.792
But nine paragraphs down in a
section he conveniently didn't bring,

15:28.886 --> 15:31.002
it clearly states
that any managing partner

15:31.097 --> 15:33.338
not ratified by a vote
is to be deemed acting

15:33.433 --> 15:34.719
and does not have
certain rights,

15:34.809 --> 15:37.392
including specifically
termination without cause.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.435
Is this true?
Technically yes, but...

15:39.522 --> 15:41.809
Well, then technically I don't see any
reason why this can't move forward.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.310
Your Honor, there is...
JUDGE COBB: Save it.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.516
You tried to put one by me.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.193
I'm moving this up in my
docket to the first available slot.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.953
You're representing her?
What the hell is that?

15:57.039 --> 15:58.780
Samantha, if they're
defending her,

15:58.875 --> 16:00.582
then no one will suspect
them of helping us.

16:00.668 --> 16:01.999
Harvey, I got
to hand it to you.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.373
Don't, because this
wasn't a move.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.000
MIKE: Wait a second. You're
actually representing her?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.706
Bullshit. That's not
what we talked about.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.791
Well, things changed
when Faye said

16:09.886 --> 16:12.048
she was gonna prove Samantha
fabricated that evidence,

16:12.138 --> 16:14.379
and we all know
what happens after that.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.839
So unless you want
to drop this thing...

16:15.933 --> 16:16.923
I'm not dropping anything,

16:17.018 --> 16:18.804
and I don't give a shit
what Faye tries.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.387
She's not finding proof.
Samantha.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.314
Instead of taking that chance,
maybe you should consider this.

16:27.528 --> 16:31.066
A settlement offer?
Are you kidding me?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.990
We started this
to get Faye out.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.864
This lets her stay
and leaves me with nothing.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.570
It leaves you with
$3 million.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.246
And we didn't do this
for the money,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.199
so why don't you tell us
what's really going on here?

16:43.127 --> 16:44.993
We already told you
what's going on.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.169
And now we're telling you
that if this goes to trial,

16:47.256 --> 16:48.712
we're not tanking
this case.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.085
We're going to war.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.634
So take that offer
and end this.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.381
I'll tell you what you can
do with that offer.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.634
You can shove it up
your... We'll think about it.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.728
FAYE: Donna, do you know
where Gretchen is? Because I need...

17:04.815 --> 17:06.852
I don't care what
you need, Faye.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.273
And I'm pretty sure
Gretchen won't care,

17:08.361 --> 17:11.569
and neither will Alex or Katrina
or anybody else around here.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.068
I see.
Word travels fast.

17:14.157 --> 17:15.898
Alex and I are the only ones
who know about your deal,

17:15.992 --> 17:17.108
if that's what you mean.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.489
And it's gonna
stay that way.

17:18.621 --> 17:19.736
But my comment stands.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.621
Donna...
His mother just died.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.494
You knew that, and you put
him in this position anyway.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.075
Save your blame, Donna.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.537
And you want to talk about
putting people in positions?

17:28.631 --> 17:30.588
You all just spent
two days together,

17:30.675 --> 17:33.212
and the day you get back,
this lawsuit comes down on me.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.794
You're going to say that none
of you knew anything about it?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.879
I'll tell you what I know.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.261
Not a week ago,
you called Harvey a cancer.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.934
But what you meant was, he's
a cancer until you need him.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.102
And what do you want me
to say to that, Donna?

17:45.189 --> 17:48.432
I don't want you to say anything,
Faye. I just want you gone.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.193
You're the real cancer
around here.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.362
And if you hurt Harvey

17:54.448 --> 17:58.112
more than he's already
been hurt, mark my words.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.902
I'll be the one
coming for you next.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.912
SAMANTHA: Okay, obviously
I'll be the first witness they call.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.837
So I say we tell them I
grew up in the foster system.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.009
I overcame obstacles to
make something of myself,

18:17.096 --> 18:18.757
including serving
my country.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.510
We play the violin until
the jury falls in love with you.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.217
I did hear it was
your specialty.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.640
Well, so is knowing
when to make a deal.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.940
You better not be saying you were
serious about considering their offer.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.562
Harvey and Louis
can't stand Faye.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.063
Now all of a sudden,
they want us to make a deal?

18:33.154 --> 18:34.610
I mean, there's got
to be a reason.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.109
And if we take the deal, we might as well
have never done this in the first place.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.731
I know that. Then why
are you suggesting it?

18:38.826 --> 18:41.614
I'm not saying we
take it. I'm saying...

18:42.455 --> 18:43.536
We should counter.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.201
And hope it flushes
the rabbit out of the hole.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.498
We may not get the truth,

18:47.585 --> 18:49.667
but at least
we'll learn something.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.494
What?
Nothing.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.250
Just first you quote
the bylaws

18:53.341 --> 18:56.129
like you're reading
a newspaper, now this.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.754
Maybe you really are
as good as they say.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.836
Maybe I am.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.014
But the two guys we're going
up against are no fools either.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.513
So what do you say we
come up with that counter?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.562
You think it's too
early for a drink?

19:13.653 --> 19:16.941
The way this day is going, I'd
say we're already four hours late.

19:17.031 --> 19:19.147
You think Mike
can convince her?

19:19.950 --> 19:21.907
Honestly, I don't even
know if we convinced him.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.235
FAYE: What the hell is this?
What the hell is what?

19:24.330 --> 19:27.743
I just got a counteroffer to a
settlement I never authorized.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.246
You authorized it the second
you told us to make this go away.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.544
I didn't say make it
go away. I said win.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.338
And a settlement
makes me look weak.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.040
They could bring it up
at trial to insinuate guilt.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.671
Bullshit, settlement offers are
inadmissible and you know it.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.298
And knowing how
you all operate,

19:41.389 --> 19:43.721
they'll just say it anyway and
have it stripped from the record.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.719
So stop trying
to get out of it

19:45.851 --> 19:48.138
and start trying to win. HARVEY:
All right, you want to win?

19:48.229 --> 19:49.560
We're gonna put you on
the stand tomorrow morning

19:49.647 --> 19:51.479
right here in front
of the entire firm.

19:51.565 --> 19:52.805
I don't need that.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.061
And in case
you haven't noticed,

19:54.151 --> 19:56.267
Samantha's not the one
on trial here. You are.

19:56.362 --> 19:58.228
Which means it's my say,
and if I tell you

19:58.322 --> 20:00.233
I don't need it,
that's how it's going to be.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.573
Here's the thing, Faye.

20:02.660 --> 20:05.118
You don't want someone
else to beat Samantha.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.694
You want me
to beat her.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.200
I know it,
and you know it.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.452
But I'm not going to court
without preparing you.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.035
So you can take it
or you can fucking leave it,

20:13.129 --> 20:14.619
but that's
how it's gonna be.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.921
Then I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.341
How do you always know
when they'll back down?

20:24.432 --> 20:26.719
It's called playing the
man, and it's what I do.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.642
Now, put the drink down.
We got work to do

20:29.729 --> 20:31.845
if we're gonna make
the most out of tomorrow.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.613
Waiting for me. That
can't mean anything good.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.649
Depends on how
you define good.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.701
What'd you find out?
Not only can Faye do

20:46.787 --> 20:48.528
everything she said,
including dismantle us.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.703
She's done it before.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.076
Well, I don't know
how you define good,

20:51.167 --> 20:52.703
but that sounds
pretty shitty to me.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.500
You haven't heard
the silver lining.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.703
That's not the only thing
she's done before.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.457
Alex, if you hadn't
caught this... I know.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.508
You think Samantha
and Mike will find it?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.960
I doubt it.
The only reason I did

21:04.054 --> 21:05.840
is that I went to the Bar
looking for something else.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.842
Well, if there's even
a chance they'll find it,

21:07.975 --> 21:09.431
Harvey needs
to know right away.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.554
Katrina.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.981
Mike.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.018
I'm guessing this isn't
a chance encounter.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.149
Look, something is going
on with Harvey and Louis.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.446
There is no way they would
be defending that woman

21:24.533 --> 21:25.819
unless they thought
they had to,

21:25.910 --> 21:27.526
and neither of them
will answer my calls.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.203
I thought the same thing,
but I asked Donna and Alex

21:30.289 --> 21:31.996
and they insisted
nothing's going on.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.914
The only thing I can
think of is that Harvey

21:34.001 --> 21:36.083
just lost his mom and he
doesn't have the stomach

21:36.170 --> 21:37.877
to tell Faye
to go fuck herself.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.624
But if she's gonna
take advantage of him,

21:39.715 --> 21:41.126
then we can take
advantage of her.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.878
Mike, if you're asking
for my help on this case,

21:42.968 --> 21:44.629
it doesn't matter
how I feel about Faye.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.085
I can't collude
against my own firm.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.887
Katrina, Samantha
lost her job.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.429
Louis has been
stripped of his title.

21:49.517 --> 21:50.848
Everybody's miserable.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.767
This is your chance to get
rid of her once and for all.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.469
Believe me,
I'd like nothing better.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.928
And I'll help if I can.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.060
But I won't cross
any lines to do it.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.107
Now, if you'll excuse me,
we're having a mock trial

22:00.194 --> 22:01.684
this morning and I
don't want to be late.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.903
HARVEY: Ms. Richardson,
as special master,

22:07.993 --> 22:11.861
do you feel there are any
limitations to your power?

22:12.164 --> 22:15.282
I can't murder anyone, if
that's what you're suggesting.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.083
But outside of that,

22:17.169 --> 22:19.752
I'm empowered to do
what I deem necessary.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.706
And eight years ago,
did you deem it necessary

22:22.800 --> 22:25.132
to dismantle the firm
Samson Kinney?

22:25.219 --> 22:27.506
I did.
But before you

22:27.596 --> 22:30.554
ripped that firm apart, you
fired one of its attorneys.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.223
Is that true?
What?

22:32.309 --> 22:33.424
I said this isn't
the first time

22:33.561 --> 22:36.144
that you've been sued
for wrongful termination.

22:36.230 --> 22:40.269
Your Honor, I'd like
to submit a settlement

22:40.359 --> 22:41.975
Ms. Richardson signed
into evidence.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.309
Where did you
get that?

22:43.404 --> 22:45.190
That settlement was sealed.
You can't enter it.

22:45.281 --> 22:47.318
I'll allow it. What the
hell is going on here?

22:47.408 --> 22:49.115
HARVEY: Why'd you fire
that lawyer, Faye?

22:49.201 --> 22:50.817
It's not relevant.
I think it is.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.778
Because I think it's the same
reason you fired Samantha Wheeler.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.285
You hated her.
You going to just sit there?

22:56.375 --> 22:57.786
You bet your ass he is,

22:57.877 --> 23:01.040
because you took his dignity
every chance you got,

23:01.130 --> 23:04.168
first by stripping his title,
then by taking Gretchen,

23:04.258 --> 23:06.841
not to mention
you made Donna a secretary.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.918
Because from
the second you got here,

23:09.013 --> 23:11.550
you hated what
everyone here stood for.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.130
That's not true.
Bullshit, it's not true.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.842
You called us a pack
of wild dogs

23:15.936 --> 23:19.224
because you are a bitter,
vindictive human being,

23:19.315 --> 23:23.183
and every single person
in this firm hates you.

23:23.277 --> 23:26.065
And you try and deny that,
I'll charge you with perjury.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.571
Are you going
to defend your client?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.026
It's time
we called a recess.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.906
And as far as I'm
concerned, we have all day.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.329
Then I'm not sitting
here another second

23:37.416 --> 23:39.453
and this travesty is over.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.255
God damn it,
what the hell was that?

23:50.346 --> 23:51.586
Exactly what
we talked about,

23:51.680 --> 23:54.047
me preparing you for
whatever they threw at you.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.098
Bullshit, that was
nothing more than a hit job

23:56.185 --> 23:57.596
in front of
the entire firm.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.018
Just like you've been taking
shots since you got here.

24:00.105 --> 24:01.345
And I've been your
number one target.

24:01.440 --> 24:06.355
Or did you forget that not a week ago,
you tried to help Malik get me disbarred?

24:06.445 --> 24:08.186
And our agreement
didn't say a thing

24:08.280 --> 24:10.396
about letting the firm know
exactly what kind of person you are.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.858
And all you are
is a sheep

24:12.952 --> 24:15.034
going wherever
your master leads you.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.610
You don't even
have the sense to...

24:16.705 --> 24:19.367
Don't you say another
word about my partner.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.745
When you stripped him
of his title,

24:21.835 --> 24:24.918
you almost cost this firm
the best lawyer it's ever had.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.746
You want to know
why I did that in there?

24:26.840 --> 24:28.751
"Cause you come after
someone I love,

24:28.842 --> 24:31.209
you're gonna get it back
like you've never seen before.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.796
Well, you better bring some of
that A game to court tomorrow.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.972
A spot just opened up
on the docket.

24:37.059 --> 24:39.642
So playtime's over.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.435
The real thing's
about to begin.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.568
Okay, let's go over your
testimony one more time.

24:48.654 --> 24:49.735
Mike, if we go over it
one more time,

24:49.863 --> 24:51.399
I'm gonna scream.
Well, too bad,

24:51.490 --> 24:53.231
because they're gonna come
after you with everything they've got.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.857
I know that. Then let's
go over the questions.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.158
I've heard
the questions.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.531
Then we're gonna come up
with new questions,

24:57.621 --> 24:58.861
because in case you forgot,

24:58.956 --> 25:00.867
you actually did what
they're accusing you of.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.665
And they'll never prove it.
God damn it, Samantha.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.664
This thing goes sideways,
you're gonna get disbarred!

25:09.633 --> 25:10.623
Look.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.469
I have been on trial before,
all right?

25:15.556 --> 25:17.672
You don't know what it's
like. Anything can happen.

25:17.766 --> 25:21.760
Maybe it can, but I'm not
the one on trial here. She is.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.515
And if you don't think
they're gonna try to flip that,

25:23.605 --> 25:25.312
then you're not the lawyer
I thought you were.

25:25.399 --> 25:28.642
And a week ago, you wouldn't have cared
one way or the other what happened to me.

25:28.736 --> 25:30.067
This isn't a week ago.
It's now.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.771
And I am not going
in there unprepared.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.945
Mind if I join you?

25:42.249 --> 25:44.616
Listen, Harvey,
about earlier...

25:44.710 --> 25:46.747
I know
I lost it, Louis.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.953
I'll keep it in check
tomorrow, I promise.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.335
No, that's not what
I was gonna say.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.758
I was gonna thank you.

25:54.762 --> 25:57.094
For what? For what
you said about me.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.924
I mean, I got chills watching you
thunder away at Faye in the library.

26:01.143 --> 26:02.850
But in your office...

26:02.936 --> 26:06.395
You have no idea how much it
meant to hear you say that you love me.

26:07.399 --> 26:11.108
I don't think I actually said
out loud, "I love you," Louis.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.734
Yeah, you did.

26:12.821 --> 26:15.313
Yeah, pretty much,
I did.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.984
Look, I don't know
how tomorrow's gonna go,

26:19.078 --> 26:20.739
but I meant what I said.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.319
You're the best lawyer
I've ever seen,

26:22.414 --> 26:24.496
and you're an
even better friend.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.414
Well, now that we're on
the subject of tomorrow,

26:28.504 --> 26:30.040
maybe we should
talk strategy.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.371
Well, I know
the strategy, Louis.

26:32.466 --> 26:33.672
We have to stick
to the fact

26:33.759 --> 26:35.875
that Faye had the right
to fire her without cause.

26:35.969 --> 26:38.131
That's not
the problem, Harvey.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.381
We need the jury to think
if they worked with Samantha,

26:41.475 --> 26:43.057
they'd fire her too.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.475
We need to get them
to hate her.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.809
So the question is, which one
of us is gonna do that to her?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.352
Let it be me.
Why?

26:50.442 --> 26:51.648
Because as good
as you are,

26:51.735 --> 26:53.772
no one is meaner than me
when they're cornered.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.943
And?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.941
Come on, Harvey,
you gonna make me say it?

26:57.032 --> 26:58.113
Your mother just died.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.565
I don't want you
to go through this, too.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.530
Thanks, Louis.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.325
Hey.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.119
"Thunder away at Faye"?

27:08.210 --> 27:10.076
Thunder away at Kendrick.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.245
Did you know you were doing
A Few Good Men?

27:13.674 --> 27:16.086
I know what you've been
going through, Harvey.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.416
And I know it's not much.

27:17.511 --> 27:20.924
I just thought it might
make you smile a little.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.301
Thanks, my friend.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.263
So you want to try a
little Top Gun, Maverick?

27:26.353 --> 27:28.060
Another time, Goose.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.308
Who the fuck is Goose?

27:31.233 --> 27:32.849
Never mind.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.186
Samantha.
I hope you don't mind.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.943
Laura let me in.
I don't mind at all.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.319
But shouldn't you be
getting some sleep?

27:41.410 --> 27:43.026
Tomorrow's gonna be
a long day.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.781
So you heard.

27:45.330 --> 27:48.243
I was Mike's first call
after you filed.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.448
Must get old,

27:49.543 --> 27:51.500
being the guy everyone
turns to for help.

27:51.587 --> 27:53.248
I'm out of the game,
Samantha.

27:53.338 --> 27:54.874
Doesn't mean I don't
like playing.

27:55.132 --> 27:56.918
(CHUCKLES)
Speaking of which,

27:57.009 --> 27:58.591
I assume you're here
to talk strategy?

27:58.677 --> 28:01.135
No. Mike and I are
solid on that.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.139
If you aren't here to discuss
the case, why are you here?

28:06.476 --> 28:09.969
I'm here to ask if you'll
come be in my corner tomorrow.

28:12.983 --> 28:14.974
Nothing in this world

28:15.777 --> 28:17.267
would keep me away.

28:32.336 --> 28:33.576
LILY: Dear Harvey,

28:33.670 --> 28:36.082
I know we've been talking
about a visit soon,

28:36.173 --> 28:39.586
and I was gonna bring this
with me as a surprise.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.794
But I don't want
to miss my chance.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.425
So I wanted to make sure
you have this,

28:45.515 --> 28:47.097
Just in case.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.427
I know your grandmother
would have loved Donna.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.605
I can't tell you how excited
I am to finally meet her.

28:54.691 --> 28:55.897
Love, Mom.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.524
You're up early.

29:05.619 --> 29:06.905
A lot on my mind.

29:08.038 --> 29:11.201
Harvey, you don't ever have to
tell me what was in that envelope.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.955
I'll understand if you just
want to keep it for yourself.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.458
I'll tell you, Donna.

29:19.132 --> 29:20.622
But not today.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.207
I understand.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.009
We should get going.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.679
Well, the trial starts today,

29:27.766 --> 29:29.552
and there's something
we haven't done yet.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.554
Not this time.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.182
Are you sure? 'Cause...

29:34.273 --> 29:35.729
I'm going against
Mike and Samantha.

29:35.816 --> 29:37.227
I can't even
tell them why.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.603
And that's not something
I want to think about

29:38.694 --> 29:40.685
the next time
we get the can opener.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.895
Well, then instead
of the can opener,

29:44.533 --> 29:47.025
why don't you practice
your opening statement on me?

29:52.291 --> 29:53.952
HARVEY: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

29:54.042 --> 29:58.161
every court case in history
has come down to one thing,

29:58.255 --> 29:59.495
proof.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.375
And the facts of
this case are...

30:01.466 --> 30:04.049
MIKE: Faye Richardson
fired my client without proof,

30:04.136 --> 30:06.503
and now she is making
the outrageous claim

30:06.596 --> 30:08.382
that she didn't have
to show cause.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.634
Even though she didn't
need a reason

30:09.725 --> 30:11.966
to fire Ms. Wheeler,
she had one.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.597
Because as anyone who's ever
worked with her knows,

30:14.688 --> 30:16.019
she's a nightmare.

30:16.106 --> 30:17.267
But not liking someone

30:17.357 --> 30:20.190
is not reason enough
to steal their livelihood.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.609
My client is not only
loyal and fierce,

30:22.696 --> 30:24.528
but she is
a brilliant attorney.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.447
And they can say she's
a saint all they want,

30:27.534 --> 30:28.695
but Faye Richardson...

30:28.785 --> 30:30.196
Deemed my client guilty

30:30.287 --> 30:33.655
and passed sentence
without proof of anything.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.285
And so,
ladies and gentlemen...

30:35.375 --> 30:36.536
It is your job

30:36.626 --> 30:38.333
to keep them from
getting away with it.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.330
Counselor, are you ready
to call your first witness?

30:43.216 --> 30:44.547
We are, Your Honor.

30:44.634 --> 30:47.126
We call Samantha Wheeler
to the stand.

30:50.891 --> 30:53.349
LOUIS: Ms. Wheeler, when
my client joined your firm,

30:53.435 --> 30:55.517
did she say if you crossed
any lines, you'd be fired?

30:55.604 --> 30:59.097
Yes, and then she fired me
without any evidence.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.649
And we're not here to debate
whether you crossed a line or not.

31:01.735 --> 31:04.067
Of course, knowing your
reputation, you probably did.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.111
Objection. He's trying
to bias the jury

31:06.198 --> 31:08.064
because his client didn't
have cause and they know it.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.444
Well, let's talk about cause.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.945
Ms. Wheeler,
the day you met,

31:11.036 --> 31:12.777
did you tell my client
to go to hell?

31:13.747 --> 31:17.160
She had just stripped my mentor's
name off the wall, and I was...

31:17.250 --> 31:18.615
LOUIS: In that
very same meeting,

31:18.710 --> 31:22.169
did you threaten to find
something and use it against her?

31:22.255 --> 31:24.212
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.757
Am I? You were defiant,
openly hostile

31:26.843 --> 31:29.210
on her very first day in
front of the firm's leadership.

31:29.304 --> 31:31.136
Is that not true?

31:31.223 --> 31:32.634
Yes, it is, but...

31:32.724 --> 31:34.180
In fact, haven't you had
numerous dustups

31:34.267 --> 31:36.099
with every single member
of the firm's leadership?

31:36.186 --> 31:37.597
Having conflict
doesn't mean...

31:37.687 --> 31:41.351
That you're willful, argumentative,
refuse to follow orders?

31:41.441 --> 31:42.681
Yes, it does, and I think
it's a pattern.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.066
That's ridiculous.
Is it ridiculous

31:45.153 --> 31:48.316
that last year, you tried to
induce me into an illegal plan

31:48.407 --> 31:50.148
to put away a mugger?

31:50.242 --> 31:53.325
Your mugger, and I didn't
follow through with it.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.198
No, you just threatened
to have the man's daughter

31:55.288 --> 31:58.326
taken away right before
you slugged him in the face.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.078
I did all of that
for you.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.706
I didn't tell you to assault him, and
I'm not the one who's on trial here.

32:03.797 --> 32:05.333
Objection.
Neither is my client.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.791
No, she's just
untrustworthy, insubordinate,

32:07.884 --> 32:09.420
and anyone who's ever worked
with Samantha Wheeler

32:09.511 --> 32:10.876
would want to fire her.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.382
Your Honor, he's testifying.
Mr. Litt.

32:12.472 --> 32:14.930
No, I'm saying poison like her
should be ripped from its root,

32:15.016 --> 32:17.599
just like my client did
for the good of this firm.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.176
Your Honor!
Mr. Litt, that's enough.

32:19.271 --> 32:20.306
I agree!

32:20.689 --> 32:22.726
We've all had enough
of Samantha Wheeler.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.398
How could you
do that to her?

32:33.493 --> 32:35.860
Katrina, it has been
a long day.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.319
Not half as long
as Samantha's.

32:37.414 --> 32:39.906
Those things you said,
Louis, it was cruel.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.241
I know what it was, Katrina.
But it had to be done.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.827
And that's not an answer. I
thought you were her friend.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.912
I am her friend.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.123
You think I didn't see
that look on her face?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.591
Then why did you do it?

32:51.678 --> 32:53.840
Because sometimes doing the
job means doing something we hate.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.216
And whether you
believe it or not,

32:55.307 --> 32:56.638
I want her to come out
of this with a win.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.386
Then tell me what's
really going on.

33:02.522 --> 33:03.933
Okay, then.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.565
Katrina,
what's going on?

33:09.905 --> 33:11.487
I was just leaving.

33:14.910 --> 33:15.900
You okay?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.156
She called me out
on today, Harvey.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.237
And she was not wrong.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.539
Louis...
It's okay.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.043
I just wish
we could tell them.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.460
Me too.

33:30.467 --> 33:31.628
Fucking Louis.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.504
After everything
I've done for him.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.836
I ought to kill him.
Samantha, calm down.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.514
Calm down? That's what
you have to say to me

33:38.600 --> 33:40.090
after your performance
in there?

33:40.227 --> 33:42.468
Excuse me? You ever
heard the word "objection"?

33:42.562 --> 33:43.927
Samantha, I objected plenty.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.353
Yeah, a lot of
goddamn good it did.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.306
I told you they were
gonna come at you.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.811
What the hell did you think
was gonna happen?

33:48.902 --> 33:50.734
I think none of this
would have ever happened

33:50.820 --> 33:52.356
if you had not come back.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.687
You mean this time, or
do you mean the first time?

33:53.782 --> 33:55.318
Because just for the record,
nobody forced you

33:55.408 --> 33:57.240
to do what you did
either time.

33:57.327 --> 33:58.658
Now, do you want to keep
taking this out on me,

33:58.745 --> 34:00.281
or do you want to
talk about tomorrow?

34:01.873 --> 34:03.409
I'm sorry.

34:04.668 --> 34:08.331
It just wasn't easy to
sit there and endure that.

34:08.420 --> 34:09.786
It wasn't.

34:10.005 --> 34:12.918
And I know that I'm not
the one you're really mad at.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.670
But I need you
to keep that anger.

34:14.761 --> 34:15.876
What are you saying?

34:15.971 --> 34:19.464
I'm saying tomorrow,
it's our turn.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.264
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:21.351 --> 34:24.217
You expecting someone?

34:26.815 --> 34:31.150
But if that's who I think it is, we
might finally have some answers.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.780
Ms. Richardson,
I'll keep this short.

34:36.866 --> 34:39.858
Do you like my client?
Not particularly, no.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.534
MIKE: Do you think
she's a good lawyer?

34:41.621 --> 34:43.703
I think she wins cases.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.246
So you thought the firm
would be better off

34:45.333 --> 34:49.042
without a good lawyer who wins cases
just because you happen to hate her.

34:49.129 --> 34:52.338
I didn't say I hate her. You're
putting words in my mouth.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.585
Well, then how about
we use some of your own?

34:57.762 --> 35:00.845
Faye, good afternoon.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.264
Eight years ago,
you fired an attorney,

35:03.351 --> 35:05.968
listed a reason in her
paperwork, and then she sued you.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.348
Isn't that right?

35:08.481 --> 35:10.222
Don't look at them.
Answer the question.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.149
Were you sued
for wrongful termination?

35:14.696 --> 35:17.438
Yes, I was.
Fantastic.

35:17.532 --> 35:21.651
Because I happen to have my
termination paperwork here today.

35:21.745 --> 35:24.783
Would you mind telling the
court what you listed as cause?

35:24.873 --> 35:26.409
I didn't list a reason.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.786
And I bet I know why.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.914
Because you learned
you don't need a reason.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.665
But if you give one,

35:32.756 --> 35:34.997
you better damn well
be able to back it up.

35:35.091 --> 35:36.957
Objection.
Now who's testifying?

35:37.052 --> 35:39.760
Did you or did you not
look me in the eye

35:39.846 --> 35:42.304
and say the reason
you fired me

35:42.390 --> 35:45.223
was because you knew
I had crossed a line?

35:46.186 --> 35:47.847
I did.
But you didn't know.

35:47.937 --> 35:50.929
You had no proof, and
when I pointed that out,

35:51.024 --> 35:53.937
you said
you didn't care.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.027
Isn't that true? You're
not giving the full context.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.444
The context is,
you wanted me gone

35:58.531 --> 35:59.942
because you think
I'm an asshole.

36:00.075 --> 36:02.533
I never said that. MIKE:
No, your lawyers did.

36:02.619 --> 36:04.781
But one of those lawyers
just took a road trip

36:04.871 --> 36:06.236
with my client
to find her father.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.368
The other invited her
to his wedding.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.948
None of this has
anything to do with...

36:10.043 --> 36:12.080
My character?
It sure as hell does,

36:12.170 --> 36:17.961
because I had friends at
your firm, Ms. Richardson.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.041
Do you?

36:19.135 --> 36:21.001
It's not my job
to make friends.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.552
And is that why
two days ago,

36:22.639 --> 36:24.004
your own lawyer
publicly stated

36:24.099 --> 36:26.716
that you are a bitter,
vindictive woman

36:26.810 --> 36:29.768
who is hated by everyone
at your firm?

36:29.854 --> 36:31.595
He did say that,
didn't he?

36:31.690 --> 36:33.852
And I remind you,
you're under oath.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.058
Yes, he did.

36:36.152 --> 36:38.894
Then who really
deserves to be fired,

36:38.988 --> 36:40.854
the lawyer who wins
cases and has friends

36:40.949 --> 36:44.112
or the one who lied about
why she let my client go?

36:47.622 --> 36:50.455
All right, we're gonna talk
about what happened in there,

36:50.542 --> 36:52.579
and we're gonna
talk about it right now.

36:52.669 --> 36:53.830
HARVEY:
What's to talk about?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.410
It was an
effective cross.

36:55.505 --> 36:56.836
Did you think they were
just gonna lay down?

36:56.923 --> 37:00.041
What I think is, you're going to
prove she fabricated that evidence

37:00.135 --> 37:01.967
because it's the
only way we can win.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.385
No, it isn't, and if it was, we
never would have taken this deal.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.678
Well, you did take this deal,

37:05.765 --> 37:07.631
and they just made me
look like shit.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.093
I get it. This is because
they embarrassed you

37:10.186 --> 37:11.551
and now you want payback.

37:11.646 --> 37:15.184
This is because you all cheated
and I'm not letting that stand.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.390
What the hell
are you talking about?

37:16.484 --> 37:18.100
There is no way
they would have known

37:18.194 --> 37:21.528
about that previous lawsuit
if you hadn't fed it to them.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.321
We didn't feed
them anything!

37:23.408 --> 37:24.944
Then how in the hell else
did they get it?

37:25.034 --> 37:27.071
I don't know. Probably
the same way we did.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.152
Which is how?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.361
None of your
goddamn business!

37:29.456 --> 37:30.787
Well, they didn't
just have that.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.206
They had direct quotes
from the mock trial,

37:33.293 --> 37:35.330
and there's only one way
they could have gotten that.

37:35.420 --> 37:40.005
Someone told them. So, I don't give a shit
if you think I'm changing our deal or not.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.173
Tomorrow when we go
back in there,

37:42.260 --> 37:44.467
you're going to prove
she crossed that line.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.646
HARVEY: Louis, we can't
prove she did it.

37:56.733 --> 37:57.973
We can't do that
to Samantha.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.978
Harvey, I don't like this
any more than you do,

38:00.069 --> 38:03.482
but the best way to protect Samantha
now is to control the narrative.

38:03.573 --> 38:07.737
You mean prove it without proving
it and hope that appeases Faye.

38:07.827 --> 38:09.989
Well, once we get Samantha
back on the stand,

38:10.079 --> 38:11.194
she's just gonna
take the Fifth.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.575
And that won't
appease Faye.

38:12.665 --> 38:15.077
And that just leaves me,
which is not happening.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.875
That leaves us with Mike.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.076
Louis, he's
Samantha's lawyer.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.332
He's bound by privilege.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.540
Not according to Kern
v. California, he's not.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.090
But he is smart enough
to let us

38:24.177 --> 38:26.509
ask the questions Faye wants,
give us the answers we need,

38:26.596 --> 38:28.462
and not say anything
to ruin Samantha.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.923
I am not putting Mike
through that wringer.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.179
He did this for me and...

38:33.269 --> 38:34.430
And what?

38:35.230 --> 38:37.471
You know what? We
wouldn't be in this boat

38:37.565 --> 38:40.023
if someone hadn't
slipped them that shit.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.233
Me? So help me, if it was you...

38:42.320 --> 38:44.027
You were the one who
got it in the first place.

38:44.113 --> 38:48.152
No, I didn't. I got it from Donna,
and she got it from Alex, and...

38:48.243 --> 38:49.984
Son of a bitch,
it was him.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.115
It wasn't Alex.
It was me.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.617
What did you just say?
Louis said he wanted

38:54.707 --> 38:56.163
Samantha to get a win.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.833
And I thought
you'd be happy, but...

38:57.919 --> 38:59.375
I don't give a shit
what you thought.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.078
You don't do something like
that without running it by me

39:01.172 --> 39:02.628
unless you're
a fucking idiot.

39:02.715 --> 39:03.921
Harvey.
I'm not an idiot.

39:04.008 --> 39:07.126
I was giving you plausible
deniability while helping our friends.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.336
No, you were ruining
the deal we made with Faye.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.762
I didn't know, and I
wouldn't have done anything

39:11.850 --> 39:13.966
if you had just kept me in
the loop. Keep you in the loop?

39:14.060 --> 39:15.300
You're lucky
I'm not firing you!

39:15.395 --> 39:16.556
KATRINA: Don't you
talk to me like that.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.057
I am a senior partner,
and I deserve...

39:18.147 --> 39:20.013
Yeah, and I'm going against
two of my closest friends.

39:20.108 --> 39:23.146
I am doing all of this
while my mother just died,

39:23.236 --> 39:24.772
and I can't even talk
to the one guy

39:24.863 --> 39:27.070
who could understand what
the hell I'm going through!

39:27.156 --> 39:30.148
So I don't give a shit if
you're a senior partner or not.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.955
Do I even have to say
that was not okay?

39:44.007 --> 39:47.625
No, Louis, you don't.
It's just...

39:47.719 --> 39:49.426
This is harder than
I thought it'd be.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.008
Well, this may come
as a shock to you, Harvey,

39:53.099 --> 39:55.887
but I know a thing or two
about pushing down feelings.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.687
You can't just expect to have
a funeral and it'll all be over.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.891
It is okay to
give yourself a break.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.309
Since when have you
become so wise?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.519
(CHUCKLES)

40:07.614 --> 40:10.197
Since spending all
those years with Stan.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.783
I know you don't have Mike
now, but you do have me.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.662
Thanks, Louis.
That helps.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.415
But right now,
we're at war.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.038
Then what do you say we do
what we have to to end this thing?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.589
Donna.
Can I come in?

40:35.683 --> 40:37.139
Yeah, of course.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.052
Can I get you
something to drink?

40:40.647 --> 40:43.730
Actually, I was hoping you'd
have a drink with someone else.

40:44.901 --> 40:47.108
Mike, I started this thing
to help Harvey,

40:47.195 --> 40:48.685
and it's obviously ended up

40:48.780 --> 40:51.112
going in a direction
that none of us expected.

40:51.199 --> 40:54.282
Donna, are you here to finally
tell me what's really going on?

40:54.369 --> 40:57.077
I'm here to say that I know that
we're in the middle of this thing,

40:57.163 --> 40:58.278
but Harvey's hurting.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.823
He needs a break, and
he needs it to be with you.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.708
You mean someone
who's lost both parents.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.832
I'm not saying you
have to talk about that.

41:05.922 --> 41:09.165
But tonight...
He needs his friend.

41:21.020 --> 41:23.136
Faye, do you have
a moment?

41:23.481 --> 41:26.018
Not really, Katrina. I'm
getting ready for tomorrow.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.850
That's why I'm here.

41:28.194 --> 41:31.152
I heard you're making
Harvey and Louis

41:31.239 --> 41:33.230
prove that Samantha
fabricated that evidence.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.782
And if you're here to make
an appeal on their behalf...

41:35.868 --> 41:38.735
I'm here to tell you they
didn't give Mike that testimony.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.370
I did.

41:41.457 --> 41:44.290
I didn't know about your
deal, and I made a mistake.

41:44.377 --> 41:46.459
You mean you colluded
against your own firm.

41:46.546 --> 41:47.911
I did.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.088
And before
you say anything,

41:50.717 --> 41:52.549
I once gave Susan
a second chance,

41:52.635 --> 41:54.797
and you disagreed
but you respected it.

41:54.887 --> 41:58.050
So you're asking me to forgive you
because you forgave someone else?

41:58.141 --> 42:02.260
I'm asking you to understand
that people make mistakes.

42:02.562 --> 42:07.307
And I am begging you not to
make Samantha pay for mine.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.476
Please, Faye, let Harvey
find another way to win

42:10.570 --> 42:12.436
without destroying
her career.

42:13.406 --> 42:14.396
All right.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.982
I respect you owning up
to your mistake.

42:17.076 --> 42:18.783
But sometimes owning up
isn't enough.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.827
So I want you packed
within the hour.

42:22.248 --> 42:23.989
What? You just said that...

42:24.083 --> 42:27.417
Katrina, I'm sorry.
You're fired.

42:27.587 --> 42:29.544
(MUSIC PLAYING)

42:54.072 --> 42:56.029
HARVEY: And then you asked me
where I got that bruise.

42:56.115 --> 42:57.856
And you said sometimes

42:57.950 --> 43:00.191
the good guys gotta
do bad things...

43:00.286 --> 43:03.153
BOTH: To make
the bad guys pay.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.782
I got to say,
I miss that.

43:07.460 --> 43:10.373
Miss what?
Making the bad guys pay?

43:11.464 --> 43:12.954
Doing it together.

43:13.716 --> 43:15.332
Especially the
early years.

43:15.426 --> 43:18.714
Mississippi Burning,
going up against Tanner.

43:18.805 --> 43:20.796
Keeping Louis from
finding out all that time.

43:20.890 --> 43:23.632
Not just Louis.
How about everybody else?

43:23.726 --> 43:25.057
Jessica.
Rachel.

43:25.144 --> 43:26.885
Hardman.
Not Donna, though.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.888
She knew from day one.

43:30.525 --> 43:31.856
She did.

43:32.443 --> 43:35.060
Because more than
anyone else, she gets me.

43:35.154 --> 43:37.816
I never did thank you for
helping to make all that happen.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.564
You're welcome, Harvey.

43:41.285 --> 43:43.071
You know, Rachel was just
saying the other day

43:43.162 --> 43:45.324
how the only thing
she regrets about leaving

43:45.414 --> 43:47.030
is not getting to see
you two as a couple.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.116
The other night,
Donna said the same thing.

43:49.210 --> 43:50.666
If that really
is the case

43:50.753 --> 43:53.620
and you miss working
together SO much,

43:54.173 --> 43:56.130
I could always use
another associate.

43:56.759 --> 43:57.920
You got to be
kidding me.

43:58.010 --> 44:00.502
Okay, okay. You
drive a hard bargain.

44:00.805 --> 44:02.671
Junior partner.
It's the best I can do.

44:02.765 --> 44:05.257
There are a million reasons
why that's never gonna happen.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.097
Not the least of which,
I never really liked you.

44:08.187 --> 44:11.054
Mmm, finally.
We're on the same page.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.308
Seriously, Mike,
I'm glad you called.

44:15.570 --> 44:18.187
I appreciate you
being here for me.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.318
Not just tonight,
with all of this.

44:20.408 --> 44:23.150
Hey, you did it for me.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.830
Well, it's late.

44:31.586 --> 44:34.078
We both need to be
at our best tomorrow.

44:37.049 --> 44:39.131
What's this?
A subpoena.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.251
We're calling you
to the stand. What?

44:41.345 --> 44:43.552
Look, I'm sorry.
You're sorry?

44:44.557 --> 44:46.298
We're supposed
to be here as friends,

44:46.392 --> 44:48.554
and this whole time, you've
been sitting on a subpoena?

44:48.644 --> 44:49.884
I don't like having
to do this either.

44:49.979 --> 44:51.845
Well, then why the hell
are you doing any of it?

44:51.939 --> 44:54.306
We had a plan.
Something changed.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.186
I want to know what it is.
We can't talk about it.

44:56.277 --> 44:59.144
God damn it, Harvey, when
the hell did you stop trusting me?

45:04.619 --> 45:07.281
You know what?
You're right.

45:08.414 --> 45:11.281
This was a nice break,
but it is over.

45:13.419 --> 45:14.534
I'll see you in court.

45:15.421 --> 45:16.957
