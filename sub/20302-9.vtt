00:01.042 --> 00:03.670
NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.753 --> 00:05.338
The black van file.

00:06.089 --> 00:07.882
Still open and active.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.885
"Dekker Avenue Merchants Association
vows to fight crime."

00:10.969 --> 00:14.305
You guys can't protect us,
and we can't go on the way we are.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.932
Those people are not cops.

00:16.016 --> 00:19.936
Suppose they lock horns with,
say, the Gypsy, or- or- or the Blood?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.772
You're underestimating the power
and the competency of these people.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.191
Holden's lie detector is inconclusive.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.651
We're turning him loose.

00:26.735 --> 00:30.572
There isn't gonna be any trial.
The evidence is purely circumstantial.

00:30.655 --> 00:33.616
You don't spend enough time
with your own son, and here you are,

00:33.700 --> 00:35.577
trying to pull off
the miracle of the century

00:35.660 --> 00:38.872
-for some street kid you don't even know.
-I do know him.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.290
And I made him a promise.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.001
Understand what?
My own partner don't want me in his house?

00:43.084 --> 00:46.463
Or maybe it's her.
Maybe she just don't cotton to white boys.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.465
She is white.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.300
What's the charge, honey?

00:50.383 --> 00:51.760
Lift up your sweater.

00:51.843 --> 00:54.304
I think you must have
some concealed weapons in there.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.221
Harris.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.475
-Ah!
-Harris.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.060
Harris!

01:04.064 --> 01:06.024
(indistinct chattering)

01:06.107 --> 01:08.359
All right. Next item is Item 10.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.196
The welfare eagle flies today.

01:12.405 --> 01:15.867
So let's put some extra attention
on those check-cashing businesses.

01:17.494 --> 01:20.163
Especially the ones
just south of the projects.

01:21.122 --> 01:24.417
Oh, thank you. That means high profile.

01:25.168 --> 01:27.253
What is known as... Morgan!

01:28.088 --> 01:29.089
(laughing)

01:29.172 --> 01:32.592
What is known as getting out of the car
and taking a look.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.845
-(officers moaning)
-Item 11.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.389
This regards
the Dekker Avenue Merchants Association.

01:38.473 --> 01:42.393
-(chattering continues)
-Now be reminded, as of Monday last,

01:42.477 --> 01:46.314
said association
is a fully sanctioned anticrime patrol.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.527
This means they're accorded the right
to carry department-style batons

01:50.610 --> 01:52.737
and perform department-style arrests.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.406
(loud indistinct chattering)

01:55.490 --> 01:56.324
Hey, hey, hey!

01:56.407 --> 01:59.244
No one's soliciting
our opinions on this one.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.496
Officer Bates.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.708
Lucy! Good morning.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.962
-(mouthing words)
-(man imitating Ricky Ricardo) Lu-cy.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.047
All right. Item 12.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.509
The ex-shooting suspect Eddie Hoban.

02:14.592 --> 02:17.887
Now, the office of the prosecution,
in its infinite wisdom,

02:17.971 --> 02:20.765
has seen fit to return
Mr. Hoban to the streets.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.643
Now, as aware as I am
of the feelings on this one,

02:23.726 --> 02:27.814
and as much as I empathize,
it's hands off Eddie Hoban.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.692
Unless he's up to his ears
in a major felony, he does not exist.

02:30.775 --> 02:33.486
-Is that understood?
-(officers grumbling)

02:33.570 --> 02:34.779
All right. The last item.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.490
-As most of you know...
-Let's let everybody go free.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.327
...Officer Vern Harris
was put to rest yesterday, with honors.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.204
I have a note here
from Mr. and Mrs. Harris.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.539
(paper crumpling)

02:44.622 --> 02:49.794
There'll be a special memorial service
at St. Teresa's, Saturday morning at 10:00

02:49.878 --> 02:52.422
for those of us wishing
to pay a final tribute.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.175
All right.
That's it. Let's roll. And, hey!

02:55.758 --> 02:59.220
-(chairs scraping against the floor)
-Let's be careful out there.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.932
Whoa, Santini.
Hey, nice job on that warrants file.

03:03.016 --> 03:06.311
-(no audible dialogue)
-Reflects a real gift for organization.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.273
You know,
there's a Captain Barlow at Division

03:10.356 --> 03:12.650
that runs a retreat for Catholic officers.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.361
I could give him a call if you'd like.
Just say the word.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.948
(murmurs)

03:19.949 --> 03:20.825
MAN: Okay.

03:20.909 --> 03:23.286
(indistinct station chatter)

03:24.579 --> 03:27.582
From the laundromat here
down over to the grocery store--

03:27.665 --> 03:28.499
Okay.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.669
-Lieutenant, you need a hand?
-I'll manage. Thanks.

03:31.753 --> 03:35.715
-Hey. Hey, I know those two.
-I know you do. You know it all.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.719
You, uh, sense a little
friction there, partner?

03:39.802 --> 03:43.473
Yeah. They'll leave, soon as
they get a taste of our coffee.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.725
LARUE: If not, maybe we can talk Furillo

03:45.808 --> 03:48.853
into getting them to take our place
on this stakeout which is get--

03:48.937 --> 03:51.606
Hey. Thought you'd given up
on that action, lover.

03:51.689 --> 03:52.690
(sighs)

03:52.774 --> 03:55.151
A man has his responsibilities, Neal.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.737
She wants me so bad
it's eating her up inside.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.241
-She just doesn't realize it yet.
-Sure.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.826
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:03.910 --> 04:06.120
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:06.204 --> 04:09.874
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:16.965 --> 04:20.885
(theme music playing)

05:17.275 --> 05:19.277
(phone ringing)

05:19.360 --> 05:22.030
You expect me to carry yours out for you?

05:22.113 --> 05:24.532
-Come on. We're running late.
-We'll be late?

05:24.615 --> 05:26.200
-That's right.
-So what?

05:26.284 --> 05:28.411
Renko, what are you gonna
write your citations on,

05:28.494 --> 05:31.497
-your gum wrappers?
-No. I thought I'd write them on my elbow.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.416
Let me tell you something,

05:33.499 --> 05:35.835
I don't think I'm in
the law-and-order mood today.

05:35.918 --> 05:39.547
Well, I'll just bring an extra along
in case you decide to change your mind,

05:39.630 --> 05:41.299
or Esterhaus changes it for you.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.468
-Hi. Fellas, have you got a minute?
-No, we don't.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.136
-Have a nice day.
-Yes. What you want?

05:45.219 --> 05:48.056
The prime suspect in your shooting
was released earlier this week.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.600
-Is that right?
-I was wondering how you felt about that.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.311
We don't feel anything about it,
as a matter of fact.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.521
-Come on, Renko.
-No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

05:55.605 --> 05:59.025
Now, let me ask you something. Look. Now,
the lady asked us a legitimate question.

05:59.108 --> 06:02.278
I think we owe her a legitimate answer,
at least a stab at one.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.573
Now, how do we feel about
the subject in question

06:05.656 --> 06:08.910
walking around out in the streets,
free as you please?

06:08.993 --> 06:13.164
Well, I cannot speak for my partner here,
but, personally,

06:14.791 --> 06:15.875
I'm tickled pink.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.252
-I'm happier than a pig in--
-Come on. Let's go.

06:18.336 --> 06:22.215
Now, wait a minute.
I am not unsympathetic to your situation.

06:22.298 --> 06:25.134
I can understand that you must be feeling
a lot of anger right now.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.845
Or a sense of injustice. Betrayal, even.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.056
After all, the system
that you have laid your life

06:30.139 --> 06:33.559
on the line for, day after day,
has in effect turned its back on you.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.644
That's pretty good.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.938
You say that so well
you oughta interview yourself.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.232
-Come on, Renko.
-Y'all put me on television, right?

06:39.315 --> 06:40.650
You gonna put me on television?

06:40.733 --> 06:43.444
Okay. look, now
I think that you oughta drive today.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.613
-'Cause I have to do my nails.
-I drove yesterday.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.491
That's why you should drive today.
Practice makes perfect.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.951
What do you know about practice?

06:50.034 --> 06:52.286
-(Renko chattering)
-Hey, babe.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.455
Don't blame yourself.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.417
They're going through
a really gnarly period.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.961
Hell, I've been there myself.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.838
You've been shot down for no reason?

07:01.921 --> 07:04.048
(exhales) Narcotics operation.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.510
The doctors gave me
a 1-in-10 chance to live. I...

07:08.094 --> 07:09.887
I find it kind of hard to talk about.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.598
-Hey, cup of tea?
-Um, well, actually--

07:12.682 --> 07:15.810
-It'll do you good. Hey, it soothes--
-Excuse me, Miss Chase.

07:15.893 --> 07:19.480
-See you a minute, J.D.?
-Sure, Lieutenant. Excuse me, babe.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.816
Are you on duty, or just in heat?

07:21.899 --> 07:23.985
Uh, right. I'm on my way.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.571
Yeah, I'll coordinate that
with Division right away.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.364
Neal. Division. Let's go.

07:29.740 --> 07:30.825
(sighs)

07:34.328 --> 07:35.872
-Captain.
-Neal.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.957
-Good morning, Frank.
-Good morning, Captain.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.420
-Ms. Chase. You're looking well-rested.
-Thank you. But actually, I'm exhausted.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.339
I've been up all night,
covering Dekker Avenue with the merchants.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.549
-So I hear.
-That's right.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.718
Nothing on the Hill slips by
the captain, does it?

07:48.801 --> 07:49.635
Yeah. More or less.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.138
There hasn't been an incident
on that street in 48 hours.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.514
Can't you give those guys a break?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.266
Those guys have gotten
everything they've asked for.

07:55.349 --> 07:58.019
Except for positive acknowledgment.
They have feelings, too.

07:58.102 --> 08:00.646
I've seen some incredibly shabby attitudes
from your guys.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.690
Attitudes are difficult to dictate.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.109
You ought to know that better
than anyone, Ms. Chase.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.027
Very nice.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.445
-(loud thud)
-MAN: Is she okay?

08:07.528 --> 08:09.614
-Is she all right?
-MAN 2: Help her up.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.910
MAN 3: Well, there's stuff
all over the floor.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.704
Sorry, lady. I'm really sorry.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.831
-We take full responsibility.
-Yeah.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.417
-Are you all right?
-Yes!

08:21.501 --> 08:24.795
Other than looking like a perfect fool,
I think I am.

08:24.879 --> 08:25.880
Ray.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.176
Would you instruct these gentlemen
not to store

08:30.259 --> 08:32.887
their law-enforcement weapons
on the floor, please?

08:32.970 --> 08:36.182
-Okay.
-I'm really sorry about that.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.892
Oh, never mind.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.228
I knew it was gonna be
one of those kind of days.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.355
I had a four-inch run in my panty hose,

08:42.438 --> 08:44.440
and then I got a $10 parking ticket.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.108
And it's not even lunchtime yet.

08:47.276 --> 08:50.613
-Who are those people?
-Just a group of concerned citizens.

08:50.696 --> 08:54.158
-(sighs)
-I'll take care of the parking ticket.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.245
You mean, fix it?

08:57.328 --> 08:59.247
No. I mean pay it.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.832
How are we coming with Hector?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.585
Terrible. Nobody'll touch him.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.005
I mean, they're either over-enrolled,
or they're scared to death of him.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.092
What about that boys' ranch in Arizona?
I thought Harvey had an in.

09:11.175 --> 09:13.052
-He gave it his best shot.
-Excuse me.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.471
But you see, with a record like Hector's,

09:15.555 --> 09:18.391
he's gonna have to spend
at least six months in Juvenile Hall

09:18.474 --> 09:21.310
before the ranch is even
gonna consider his application.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.396
Am I hearing correctly?

09:24.689 --> 09:26.148
Hector Ruiz?

09:27.275 --> 09:31.112
Is this woman endeavoring to move
that little sociopath onto a ranch?

09:32.029 --> 09:33.030
I'm sorry, Frank,

09:33.114 --> 09:35.533
but does this woman know
that little ferret's record?

09:35.616 --> 09:38.369
Yes, I believe she does, Howard.
And this woman is Fay.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.580
-Fay?
-Fay.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.958
-Fay. Oh, Fay, the little woman.
-(chuckles)

09:44.041 --> 09:46.711
-Former little woman.
-Oh, it's been years.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.422
-How are you? Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you, Howard.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.840
-Fay.
-FAY: (laughs)

09:50.923 --> 09:54.176
-Howard.
-Well, friends still.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.637
Excuse me, Fay.
Francis, you're wanted at Division.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.640
-Oh, right away, Phil.
-Don't run out on me, Frank.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.684
Division can wait.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.437
I am deeply disturbed by what I'm hearing.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.274
I was on that firing line both times,
and I must say

10:08.357 --> 10:11.652
I don't see how
any right-thinking person could consider

10:11.736 --> 10:16.157
anything but maximum security
for that sawed-off little Hispanic.

10:16.240 --> 10:20.161
Send him off to a ranch.
Why not Waikiki Beach?

10:20.244 --> 10:24.248
Judas! We are talking about
legally diseased brains here.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.709
I mean, these are mutated
third-world genes.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.962
A roach in the men's room
has more redemptive tissue.

10:30.046 --> 10:34.216
Howard, have you ever thought about
this fear of foreigners,

10:34.300 --> 10:36.552
this loathing for pigmentation you have,

10:36.636 --> 10:41.098
that it might be related
to some deeply-rooted sexual conflict?

10:41.182 --> 10:42.683
Oh, just what we need, Henry.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.770
GOLDBLUME: I've got your number.
Leather sheets, camouflage pajamas.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.439
You scream loud and clear
next time you need emergency action

10:48.522 --> 10:50.608
-to save your blintzes.
-Tell 'em why you're not married.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.486
Clear something up for me, Howard.
Rumor in the squad room has it--

10:53.569 --> 10:55.404
-It's an odd ship, Frank.
-(both shouting)

10:55.488 --> 10:57.490
Howard! Henry! Shut up!

10:59.325 --> 11:01.118
(calmly) Into my office. Now.

11:09.543 --> 11:12.380
(dispatcher on radio, indistinct)

11:12.463 --> 11:16.759
Well, well, well. There goes
the Dekker Avenue Rangers.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.595
It's copacetic with me. Let 'em.

11:20.304 --> 11:24.058
Hey, I know how you feel
about the job, cowboy, but it'll pass.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.060
(sighs) I don't care if it passes or not.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.646
I'm just gonna have a good time.
I'm gonna enjoy myself.

11:28.729 --> 11:31.649
Oh, yeah, sure you are.
You're having a great time.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.901
A great time. Uh. Uh.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.070
Pull over right here.
It's my 11:00 appointment.

11:36.153 --> 11:39.407
-HILL: You gotta be kidding. They're okay.
-RENKO: Yeah, I know they're okay.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.951
-That's why I'm taking them to lunch.
-To lunch? Why lunch?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.119
Why not?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.374
Good morning, my beauties.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.794
-Andy, we ain't done nothing. I swear.
-(mouthing word)

11:51.877 --> 11:55.131
(upbeat music playing)

11:55.214 --> 11:57.967
-Charlene.
-Come on, man. We got rent to pay.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.844
You also gotta eat, don't ya?

11:59.927 --> 12:02.805
Come here. Come here. Y'all come with me.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.057
Come on now.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.274
-<i>Monsieur</i> Hill?
-Yeah?

12:13.357 --> 12:15.192
Compliments of <i>Monsieur </i>Renko.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.697
I don't want any part of this,

12:19.780 --> 12:22.032
and you can return it to <i>Monsieur </i>Renko,

12:22.783 --> 12:24.744
and tell him where he can put it.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.705
<i>Oui</i>, <i>Monsieur</i>.

12:33.794 --> 12:37.089
Andy, can we get outta here?
I don't usually eat this early.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.551
What, you nervous about
people staring at us, darling?

12:41.343 --> 12:42.636
Let me tell you something.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.098
The only reason they're staring at us
is because we're in uniform.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.768
-(chuckling)
-(laughing)

12:51.061 --> 12:53.814
No, but seriously.
Now, seriously, my beauties.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.860
These people here have nothing on us.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.906
Matter of fact, we probably have
more of a right to be here than they do.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.158
You see, we earned it.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.994
We put our bodies on the line.

13:07.077 --> 13:09.538
Now he's gonna talk to us about bodies.

13:09.622 --> 13:13.417
-(laughing)
-RENKO: No, no. I'm serious here.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.877
I wanna tell you something.

13:15.711 --> 13:17.922
In the last six months of my life,

13:18.005 --> 13:21.801
I've done more thinking
than at any other time in my 31 years.

13:23.093 --> 13:26.096
And I spent two months
of that time in a hospital,

13:26.180 --> 13:29.225
flat on my back, all alone.

13:30.726 --> 13:34.480
I had tubes running
in and out my nose, you know.

13:34.563 --> 13:38.025
I had fluid running in and out
various parts of my body.

13:38.108 --> 13:41.403
I wanna tell you, you talk about thick.
You look at that sauce there.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.448
Oh, Andy, I don't like hospital stories.

13:44.532 --> 13:47.243
I'm just saying the fluid was
as thick as this stuff in here.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.412
-Andy. Andy, Andy. She means it.
-Oh. I don't feel too, too good.

13:50.496 --> 13:54.792
-Look, I know her. She's gonna barf.
-Oh! Oh!

13:55.543 --> 13:56.710
Aw, darling.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.963
Get the other cop in here fast.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.841
(uncomfortable chattering)

14:01.924 --> 14:03.717
Now, what are you staring at, honey?

14:03.801 --> 14:05.928
I think that's quite enough, Officer.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.847
What do you mean "that's quite enough"?

14:07.930 --> 14:11.475
-I mean, you are out of line.
-I wanna tell you something, partner.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.728
I paid just as much money
as you did to sit here and eat this stuff.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.438
And I got as much a right

14:16.522 --> 14:18.482
-as you do to sit here and eat this stuff.
-Come on, cowboy.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.109
-I want that man's name.
-Yes, sir.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.902
-And his badge number.
-Of course, sir.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.946
-Everything's gonna be all right.
-He's treating me like

14:24.029 --> 14:26.156
some kind of second-class citizen.
I'm an officer of the law.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.326
-Let's get the ladies back to work.
-My name is Renko, buddy. R-E-N-K-O.

14:29.410 --> 14:30.703
Andrew, C.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.664
Okay, thanks a lot.

14:33.747 --> 14:37.084
Hey, what makes you so sure
the chick's a cop groupie, huh?

14:37.167 --> 14:41.922
Hey, man, she's got a vase
on her nightstand with 30 bullets in it.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.883
-You know, like mementos.
-Mm-hmm?

14:46.010 --> 14:48.929
Hey. What say, you guys?
How's it going? How's things?

14:49.013 --> 14:51.682
Look, man, you don't exist.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.934
-Now, split.
-Hey, wait a minute.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.686
Hey, I could help you guys.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.939
Hey, wait a minute.
There are things going down, man.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.274
Take a walk, Hoban.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.109
-What do you mean take a walk?
You kidding?

15:02.192 --> 15:05.404
I know a lot.
It wouldn't cost you hardly anything.

15:05.487 --> 15:08.574
Um, uh, just a double saw for now, okay?

15:08.657 --> 15:13.037
-Get your hand off the car, man.
-Come on, man. I'm dead out here.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.456
Everybody thinks I rolled over
is why I was sprung.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.917
Hey, you guys, give me a break, huh?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.252
I didn't shoot those cops, man.
I swear to God.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.005
-I told you to get away from the car, man.
-Hey, look, man,

15:23.088 --> 15:25.466
-I was just trying--
-Get away from me too! Now move it!

15:25.549 --> 15:28.135
All right. I'm just trying to do you
a favor, you know?

15:29.678 --> 15:33.641
Weird. You know,
I almost feel sorry for the little creep.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.559
-Yeah. I know what you mean.
-(sighs)

15:35.643 --> 15:37.227
Hey, what say we move it, babe, huh?

15:37.311 --> 15:38.938
Coley and Lyle. They wanna go home.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.816
-And as of now, we keeping them waiting.
-Hey! Hey let me finish this, huh?

15:42.900 --> 15:43.943
Oh.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.988
(exhales) Liquor store stakeout.

15:48.072 --> 15:52.534
Five hours on top of a cooler
watching some dude punch his register.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.287
You know, I've ruined
three pair of pants on this gig.

15:55.371 --> 15:57.498
Yeah, me too, lover. Me too.
Come on, man. Let's go.

15:57.581 --> 15:58.415
Hey.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.170
-How's Jill?
-You wanna drive the car, J.D.?

16:04.713 --> 16:07.800
Actually, I'm, uh,
kinda waiting on somebody.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.053
I invited her to come along.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.266
-Invited who? Who you talking about?
-(horn honks)

16:21.689 --> 16:23.899
Uh-uh. You know, lover,

16:23.983 --> 16:27.945
-I have just about had it with you, man.
-Hey, come on.

16:28.028 --> 16:32.241
Think about it: me and her,
thigh-to-thigh, up on top of that cooler.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.827
-How could you pass on that?
-Easy.

16:34.910 --> 16:37.997
All I got to do is worry
about somebody shooting at me.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.457
Never happen.

16:41.083 --> 16:45.254
My horoscope said today
is an excellent day for social release.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.839
(engine starts)

16:46.922 --> 16:50.217
(upbeat music playing)

17:03.939 --> 17:05.899
(no audible dialogue)

17:16.201 --> 17:17.077
LARUE: Drop!

17:20.414 --> 17:22.791
-How'd I do?
-Good, Mr. Lem.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.545
WASHINGTON: Bernard, your camera mount's
punching a hole in my lung.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.048
CHASE: What was the sergeant
talking about this morning,

17:29.131 --> 17:31.842
in roll call. I mean, about Eddie Hoban?

17:32.593 --> 17:35.471
He shot down two cops,
and he walked away from it.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.097
Which makes the dude a leper.

17:37.181 --> 17:40.142
(dispatcher on radio, indistinct)

17:40.225 --> 17:42.478
It must be a hundred degrees up here.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.064
Why don't you take off that hot sweater?

17:45.147 --> 17:47.441
I'd love to, but I'm not wearing
anything underneath.

17:47.524 --> 17:50.319
Hey, that's okay.
We're all business up here.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.072
-We're used to that sort of thing.
-WASHINGTON: Oh, man.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.908
-You say something, babe?
-Later, J.D.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.660
Bernard, my man, we have got to get
something straight here.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.622
This little space here
is for me to aim my weapon. You dig?

18:01.705 --> 18:03.373
How am I supposed to get any coverage?

18:03.457 --> 18:06.710
-(police radio continues)
-Bernard, could you turn the radio up?

18:06.794 --> 18:08.837
BERNARD: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.466
J.D., it's bad enough up here, man,
without all this, you know?

18:12.549 --> 18:14.927
Hey, why don't you
loosen up a little, man?

18:16.011 --> 18:17.304
Hey, really, babe,

18:17.387 --> 18:20.182
I'd hate to see a sweater that fine
get ruined up here.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.059
Would you give it a rest?

18:23.685 --> 18:26.814
I'm not trying to put any kind
of moves on you, ma'am.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.857
(groans)

18:34.696 --> 18:35.864
Oh, Howard.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.202
Interesting little book here.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.955
<i>Your Kind, My Kind, Humankind.</i>

18:43.038 --> 18:44.456
Shimmerfeldt.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.876
-You've heard of him perchance?
-I can't say that I have.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.424
I'm okay, Phil.

18:56.093 --> 18:58.345
-Really. I'm okay.
-I know that.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.722
I'm okay. You're okay. We're okay.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.100
Okay? Ahh!

19:03.183 --> 19:06.311
-Okay.
-(laughing)

19:08.147 --> 19:12.526
Look at that.
Strawberry jam in the trigger housing.

19:12.609 --> 19:13.986
Judas H.!

19:14.069 --> 19:16.029
Interesting passage here.

19:16.113 --> 19:19.741
Shimmerfeldt says
we don't really know what we're asking.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.035
For instance, the common "Hi. How are ya?"

19:22.119 --> 19:24.913
Are we asking after your state of being?

19:24.997 --> 19:30.043
Or are we really asking:
how am I in relationship to you?

19:30.127 --> 19:33.755
Am I liked? Am I loved? Am I superfluous?

19:34.423 --> 19:36.800
Oh, trenchant stuff.

19:36.884 --> 19:40.387
Uh, sounds a little Adlerian
by way of Jung.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.431
Not bad for pop psychology.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.849
Who turned you on to this?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.934
Henry Goldblume.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.562
If you don't mind my saying so, Howard,

19:48.645 --> 19:51.481
I think you underestimate the man.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.442
Let me say this about that, Phil.

19:54.109 --> 19:57.988
He may be your kind.
He may perhaps even be humankind.

19:58.071 --> 20:02.326
But he is not, and will never be, my kind.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.911
(metal clatters on floor)

20:05.370 --> 20:07.080
(murmurs)

20:13.754 --> 20:18.008
-Do something for you?
-Uh... Um, I didn't mean to disturb you.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.177
Go ahead, kid. Don't mind me.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.179
I'm just setting up for a CPR class.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.890
Dekker Avenue Merchants Association.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.434
-Yeah, they're a real pain, aren't they?
-Mm-hmm.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.229
-But I can see where they're coming from.
-Yeah, right. Me, too.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.396
Sure.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.816
Uh, Sergeant,
do you mind if I ask you a question?

20:35.525 --> 20:36.652
No. Ask away.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.656
You know, I've noticed that, uh,

20:41.448 --> 20:43.367
you really, uh, handle things.

20:45.619 --> 20:48.247
You really seem to be tuned in, you know.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.792
Like, uh, you really have
your act together, emotionally speaking.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.211
I guess you missed my act
with Hunter upstairs, huh?

20:55.128 --> 20:56.380
That guy.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.300
I don't understand that guy.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.139
I'm having trouble understanding
a lot of things, lately.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.934
You've been through a rough one, son.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.231
-How do you do it?
-How do you do it?

21:15.565 --> 21:19.027
You do it. Sometimes you don't do it.

21:20.028 --> 21:21.280
Uh, I don't know.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.366
And- my- my dad's a cop.

21:24.449 --> 21:28.161
My uncle's a cop.
My two brothers on Long Island are cops.

21:28.245 --> 21:31.123
There's never, ever been any question
about me being a cop.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.791
Till now?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.672
Do you ever regret becoming a policeman?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.549
Sometimes.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.469
You know, in college,
I minored in meteorology

21:44.553 --> 21:47.556
and communications,
with an eye towards being a TV weatherman.

21:47.639 --> 21:50.475
You do look like that guy
that does the weather on, what,

21:50.559 --> 21:51.810
Channel 6 is it, huh?

21:51.893 --> 21:53.729
-Cute.
-Knock it off, Bates.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.481
I mean it, Henry. I'll tell ya something.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.483
You know, half the women I know

21:58.567 --> 22:01.278
-rate this guy a ten on the Richter scale.
-Lucy.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.447
Wait a second, Sergeant.
You do look like the guy.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.658
Please, both of you,
would you give me a break?

22:06.742 --> 22:08.702
-Okay, okay.
-Thank you very much.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.746
Full moon out tonight, Henry.

22:16.251 --> 22:19.421
WOMAN (on radio): <i>Attention all units</i>
<i>in the vicinity of the east projects.</i>

22:19.504 --> 22:22.799
<i>Please assist the fire department</i>
<i>in a four-alarm fire. Attention all units.</i>

22:22.883 --> 22:25.594
D'you hear that? They got a four-alarm
fire in the east projects.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.971
Think we'll be able
to stop by the projects later?

22:28.055 --> 22:30.557
Sure, babe. Anything you want.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.768
-Turn it off, Bernard!
-(radio off)

22:32.851 --> 22:35.437
-How's it going, my good man?
-Fine. May I help you, sir?

22:35.520 --> 22:38.607
Sure. Give me a pint
of that 2.98 vodka up on the shelf.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.696
-I think I can use another one.
-Another one?

22:45.489 --> 22:46.948
Don't turn around, mister. Just--

22:47.032 --> 22:49.493
-Drop! Police officers! Freeze it!
-Police officers!

22:59.169 --> 23:00.420
Drop it!

23:01.296 --> 23:03.799
Turn around! Hands on the counter!

23:06.760 --> 23:09.346
(siren wailing in distance)

23:11.139 --> 23:12.265
(gasps)

23:19.773 --> 23:22.359
-(indistinct chattering)
-(siren wailing)

23:31.535 --> 23:33.745
-HILL: Where's LaRue?
-We heard someone got killed.

23:33.829 --> 23:34.913
The suspect.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.373
LaRue's okay. He's inside.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.793
The lady here, she's still a little shaky,
but she'll be okay.

23:42.045 --> 23:45.298
(bell chiming)

23:48.093 --> 23:49.136
(gasps)

23:51.596 --> 23:52.681
Hooh.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.435
(exhales) Hairy afternoon, huh?

23:56.518 --> 23:58.728
Looks like the media
got here before it began.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.940
-That's what I call hairy.
-Uh, yeah.

24:02.023 --> 24:05.735
Uh, look, I was kinda wondering if, uh,

24:05.819 --> 24:09.072
you guys would put out the word
not to overcirculate that thing.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.908
-Hey, I'll make it up to you.
-Fine with me.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.535
Bobby?

24:14.828 --> 24:17.122
What happened to that tape that lady shot?

24:17.205 --> 24:20.542
-No problem. Neal got it.
-(screwing bottle cap)

24:20.625 --> 24:23.378
Come on, guys. Look, I'm sorry.
I thought it was a cold stakeout.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.422
I thought nobody was gonna show up.

24:25.505 --> 24:27.299
I thought nothing was gonna happen.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.345
Want a little brace?

24:38.518 --> 24:41.271
Bobby? Hey. Hey, Bobby.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.484
(chattering on police radio)

24:48.945 --> 24:51.656
-What's with him, man?
-Nah, don't worry about him.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.034
He's just got his shorts
tacked on there too tight.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.785
(both laughing)

24:55.869 --> 24:58.705
You know, I've been thinking,
maybe you and me oughta get together

24:58.788 --> 25:00.790
and do some serious cruising sometime.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.918
-Serious cruising sometime.
-Mm-hmm.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.169
Ooh!

25:07.297 --> 25:08.131
(exhales)

25:08.215 --> 25:10.842
(crowd chattering)

25:12.719 --> 25:14.012
Now, what?

25:16.473 --> 25:17.766
I said, what?

25:19.309 --> 25:21.937
All right, man. You and me, right now.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.648
-You got it! Don't--
-Don't go grabbing me!

25:24.731 --> 25:26.525
Jesus! Look at all the people around here.

25:26.608 --> 25:29.486
I'm gonna tell you something, Renko.
I'm sick to death of you

25:29.569 --> 25:32.822
raging around here like some big,
overage baby!

25:32.906 --> 25:35.408
Renko, I gotta tell you. You have lost me.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.619
-No, no, no.
-You wanna talk about it?

25:37.702 --> 25:39.746
We're gonna deal with it right now!

25:39.829 --> 25:43.542
I have listened to you.
I have made excuses for you.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.377
And I have turned the other way.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.629
I have waited, and I have watched.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.799
I have waited for you to change.
And nothing's changing.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.927
And I'm beginning to think
that nothing is gonna change.

25:54.010 --> 25:55.637
And I've had it!

25:55.720 --> 25:58.723
You wanna be like John D. LaRue
with a pint in your pocket?

25:59.975 --> 26:01.434
Fine.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.062
But you get yourself another partner!

26:04.646 --> 26:06.898
'Cause I care about what I do.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.279
Hey, babe, uh,

26:12.362 --> 26:14.823
you wanna run a couple of those lines
past me again?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.367
I think I'm gonna need them on J.D.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.341
Hey. Hey, Brenda.
Hey, long time. What do ya say?

26:34.092 --> 26:36.720
Hey, Brenda. Hey, what's up with you, man?

26:38.013 --> 26:39.306
Hey, you owe me.

26:41.016 --> 26:44.352
Hey, Marty. Hey, Marty. I've been trying
to catch up with you, man.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.439
Listen. I got a line
into some guys uptown, man.

26:47.522 --> 26:49.524
I mean, this stuff is just primo.

26:50.150 --> 26:53.069
-You smell dead meat?
-Oh, come on, Marty.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.156
Hey, what they're saying about me
is just not so, man.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.158
You know me, Marty.

26:59.659 --> 27:00.869
On your grave.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.182
(engine starts)

27:26.645 --> 27:27.771
This way.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.570
Captain.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.823
These people tried cashing this
at Petrie's drugstore.

27:38.907 --> 27:43.036
It's a stolen check.
They had no matching identification.

27:43.119 --> 27:45.997
Since we brought in the suspects
and we got the evidence,

27:46.081 --> 27:47.957
do we book them? Or do you?

27:50.543 --> 27:52.587
You tried to pass a bad check?

28:00.762 --> 28:04.391
Ray, would you see to it
that the suspects are Mirandized

28:04.474 --> 28:06.768
and escorted to Booking, please?

28:06.851 --> 28:08.895
All right. Gentlemen, let's go.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.235
ARCANIAN: Is this your collar
or my collar?

28:15.318 --> 28:17.529
Your collar, my collar, our collar.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.073
LaRue, Washington.
The captain would like to see you.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.282
Yeah, we know.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.873
Went down pretty good, Captain.

28:28.957 --> 28:32.585
We had to down one guy, Captain,
after he opened up fire on us.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.839
-The other suspect is being booked now.
-Okay. Good work.

28:35.922 --> 28:39.342
It was really Neal
who took the guy out, Captain.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.971
-I thought you should know.
-It's good of you to tell me that, J.D.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.933
-I want the write-up on it right away.
-Yes, sir.

28:47.016 --> 28:48.935
Uh, J.D., a moment.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.734
And if that other thing
that happened out there

28:55.817 --> 28:58.361
ever happens again, you're out!
You hear me? You're out.

29:01.364 --> 29:02.365
Yes, sir.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.916
(phone rings)

29:12.917 --> 29:16.045
-Yeah.
-Furillo. This Hector situation,

29:16.129 --> 29:18.089
it isn't going to happen from this end.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.008
Skip Fitzgerald, he really tried.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.926
<i>So did I. So did my ex.</i>

29:22.010 --> 29:24.512
I know what you promised, Frank,
and I know how you feel,

29:24.596 --> 29:27.599
but there's absolutely nothing any of--
Wait a minute. Hold on.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.893
Taxi!

29:30.643 --> 29:32.771
Ta-- (whistles)

29:36.107 --> 29:38.860
Look, Frank, he's going
to have to sit it out in Juvenile Hall

29:38.943 --> 29:41.112
for at least six months
before they'll reconsider.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.740
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>
-I know you are.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.201
I'm just trying to figure out
what the hell to do about it.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.494
I don't know, either.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.329
Later, huh?

29:52.415 --> 29:55.084
Oh! Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute. That's my cab.

29:55.168 --> 29:58.046
Look, I'm the one who called it.
I'm sorry.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.553
(sighs)

30:10.058 --> 30:11.810
MAN: Hill Street, Sergeant Becker.

30:15.104 --> 30:18.024
Sarge. Excuse me.

30:24.113 --> 30:26.115
(gear ratchets, beeps)

30:32.288 --> 30:33.623
-Thank you.
-(chuckles)

30:33.706 --> 30:36.876
Guess who's taking his woman
out on her first stakeout?

30:36.960 --> 30:38.378
Does the captain know about this?

30:38.461 --> 30:42.006
-I went off the clock 20 minutes ago.
-Aha!

30:42.799 --> 30:44.592
Phony stakeout. Hmm.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.053
You know, I took my wife on one of those
a couple years back

30:47.136 --> 30:49.138
just to punch up the old juices.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.349
Worked so well,
she couldn't wait to get home.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.017
We had to check in to a motel.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.312
It's not what you think it is.
She's really interested in police work.

30:56.396 --> 30:58.356
Oh, that goes without saying, Mick.

31:03.278 --> 31:05.613
You know, if I had
to do it all over again,

31:06.656 --> 31:10.535
I used to work with, uh, a cabinetmaker
when I was in school.

31:10.618 --> 31:13.204
I used to build cabinets.
I was really good with my hands.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.832
I'll bring in some snapshots sometime.

31:15.915 --> 31:19.711
-How old are you, son? 22, 23?
-Nah. I'm 25.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.462
-That old?
-Yeah.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.382
Santini, if you're asking me
for some kind of answer,

31:24.465 --> 31:25.592
I can't give it to you.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.678
-I'm sorry.
-(sighs) Okay.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.889
All I can say is, look,

31:31.806 --> 31:34.434
the closest my family ever
came to a police department

31:34.517 --> 31:36.394
was my Aunt Esther the Terrible.

31:36.477 --> 31:39.314
When they found out I was in the academy,
they went into mourning.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.859
My wife, we were engaged at the time,
broke it off.

31:42.942 --> 31:44.652
They got over it, Santini.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.822
ESTERHAUS: I don't agree.
No, I don't agree.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.782
The man is suggesting that group sex

31:49.866 --> 31:52.535
is a valid expression
of the nuclear community.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.705
That strikes me
as dangerously irresponsible.

31:55.788 --> 31:58.458
Not to mention unsanitary in the extremis.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.418
-(phone rings)
-Where does it say that?

32:00.501 --> 32:02.712
I don't know about this guy, Henry.

32:02.795 --> 32:05.465
MAN: Sergeant Goldblume. Telephone.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.843
I just said read it, Phil, not worship it.
I don't agree with him either.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.929
Line 2. Wouldn't give his name.

32:12.472 --> 32:13.640
Detective Goldblume.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.725
He's such a cute guy.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.063
Where are you?

32:21.898 --> 32:23.483
Stay there. I'm on my way.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.362
I'm sorry I can't run the heater.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.822
I know. They'd spot our exhaust smoke.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.449
Right.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.327
That's what I mean about stakeouts.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.996
It's real easy to make a mistake out here.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.582
For instance, you wash your car,

32:39.666 --> 32:42.043
the sun reflects off the chrome,
they make you.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.587
That's how come your car's
always so dirty.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.964
Absolutely.

32:47.048 --> 32:50.677
-I have goose bumps all over.
-You're cold.

32:51.260 --> 32:54.097
-Excited.
-Deb, you gotta remember something.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.766
These things can take weeks, months even.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.811
But it's worth it,
because the guy we're waiting on

32:59.894 --> 33:01.354
is a very big dealer.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.106
That's why it's so dangerous.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.776
You mean, he'd shoot it out if he had to.

33:06.859 --> 33:09.070
Are you kidding? No doubt whatsoever.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.823
(shudders)

33:13.658 --> 33:15.994
You wanna leave?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.707
Is that him?
That man lighting a cigarette?

33:22.875 --> 33:24.377
No, that's not him.

33:26.087 --> 33:27.797
Ah.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.758
You see that guy over there
in the dark cap and jacket?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.051
Is that him?

33:32.135 --> 33:35.221
-No, that's not him. That's my signalman.
-(laughs)

33:35.304 --> 33:38.266
That means it's off for tonight. Sorry.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.184
We'll come back tomorrow, won't we?

33:40.268 --> 33:41.477
Sure.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.481
I'm hungry. You wanna get
a cheeseburger or something?

33:45.565 --> 33:48.985
No. I wanna go home.

33:58.745 --> 34:02.206
Oh. I'm not crazy about the lock.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.624
No dead bolt.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.714
(door closes)

34:26.856 --> 34:28.149
Please.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.818
Kiss me hard, Mick.

34:31.444 --> 34:33.279
Oh, Mick.

34:36.532 --> 34:37.825
Harder.

34:43.122 --> 34:45.458
-Grab my hair.
-Why?

34:45.541 --> 34:47.335
-I like your hair.
-It likes you.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.212
-Grab it.
-I don't wanna grab it.

34:50.296 --> 34:52.757
I want you to own me, Mick.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.760
What's that supposed to mean?

34:55.843 --> 34:59.555
It means I want you
to be stronger with me, more forceful.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.266
Like how?

35:06.020 --> 35:09.148
Whoa. (moaning)

35:18.407 --> 35:21.285
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

35:21.369 --> 35:22.620
(gasps)

35:25.498 --> 35:29.168
-Because I love you.
-Then show it.

35:30.628 --> 35:32.421
I thought I was.

35:36.509 --> 35:39.428
I'm not ashamed of what I need.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.223
You're acting like I--

35:46.686 --> 35:49.397
Don't look at me that way.

36:25.474 --> 36:28.186
(indistinct chattering)

36:28.269 --> 36:30.980
(woman yawning)

36:45.494 --> 36:47.788
(thunder rumbling)

37:08.226 --> 37:10.519
(indistinct chattering)

37:18.819 --> 37:21.030
MAN: Hill Street Station,
Lieutenant Williams.

37:26.619 --> 37:28.496
(knocking)

37:32.124 --> 37:34.794
Excuse me, Captain.
You said that if I ever wanted to

37:34.877 --> 37:36.587
come and talk to you, that I could.

37:36.671 --> 37:39.840
-I can see you're busy though.
-No, no. Come on in. Close the door.

37:43.177 --> 37:44.220
Have a seat.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.309
It's funny, you know. I've, uh,

37:50.393 --> 37:52.103
I've never really been in here before.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.772
You haven't missed a whole hell of a lot.

37:54.855 --> 37:58.109
-(chuckles)
-It's nice. You know?

37:58.192 --> 37:59.944
Yeah, it's a regular penthouse.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.239
What's cooking, Santini?

38:05.908 --> 38:08.953
Uh, I was wondering if you'd mind

38:09.036 --> 38:12.707
not partnering me up
with anyone right away.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.168
I just, I really don't think I'm gonna be
very effective out there right now.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.586
That's understandable.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.089
There's no rush.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.092
Uh, actually,

38:23.884 --> 38:26.971
I was thinking maybe you'd recommend me
for a leave of absence.

38:27.054 --> 38:31.434
I, uh, I feel I just need a little time
to get away to think about things.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.649
Let me be real candid, Santini.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.407
I think you have a lot
of good qualities and abilities

38:46.490 --> 38:48.743
that could probably
get you far in the world.

38:48.826 --> 38:52.496
But I think we both know you'd be
lots happier in another line of work.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.415
I'm not unfamiliar with your family.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.209
-I know there's lots of tradition there.
-Yeah.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.545
But I don't think this is
a line of work to be in

38:59.628 --> 39:01.797
just because you don't
wanna offend someone.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.507
Maybe you oughta fire me.

39:04.717 --> 39:07.345
You don't want that, Santini.
And I couldn't do that anyway.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.809
My spies tell me
you're a talented cabinetmaker.

39:15.978 --> 39:17.480
Go make cabinets.

39:18.898 --> 39:22.943
-My dad is really gonna be mad at me.
-That's all right.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.863
It's all part of coming into your own.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.452
So, what do I,
will I give you my badge now or...

39:31.535 --> 39:33.454
Phil will walk you
through all the paperwork.

39:33.537 --> 39:35.039
But, think about it a couple of days.

39:35.122 --> 39:37.458
I really don't think
I'm gonna have to think about it.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.211
I feel better than I've felt
in about two years.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.921
That's what it's all about.

39:43.255 --> 39:44.590
Thank you.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.137
Thank you very much.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.558
(door closes)

39:58.646 --> 40:01.982
-(mumbling)
-(typing slowly)

40:14.578 --> 40:17.915
Y'all got that hunt-and-peck method
down pretty good there, don't ya?

40:25.214 --> 40:27.675
Why don't you let me type?
We'll be done before Christmas.

40:31.971 --> 40:33.305
Suit yourself.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.233
(sighs) You know what?

40:47.653 --> 40:49.447
You know what your problem is?

40:51.282 --> 40:52.491
Me.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.997
You got that right.

41:05.045 --> 41:06.213
Casey?

41:07.840 --> 41:09.258
Tell the captain we're here.

41:09.341 --> 41:12.011
(typewriter clattering)

41:19.518 --> 41:20.644
Hoban.

41:21.437 --> 41:23.314
(typing continues)

41:25.900 --> 41:29.236
(police radio continues)

41:53.010 --> 41:54.094
Eddie.

41:55.304 --> 41:56.597
Same place.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.526
I mean, you know how it goes, right?

42:14.114 --> 42:16.283
I, uh- uh.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.035
All of a sudden, it was- it was

42:20.120 --> 42:21.330
bang.

42:22.998 --> 42:24.959
And then, then it was over.

42:27.127 --> 42:31.382
It was, uh- uh,
it was over before you even know.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.300
You know what- you know what I mean?

42:34.510 --> 42:36.136
(Hoban's voice)<i> And, you see, uh,</i>

42:37.763 --> 42:40.849
<i>like it- and all of a sudden, um</i>

42:41.392 --> 42:43.602
FURILLO (on tape):
<i>It's okay, Eddie. Take your time.</i>

42:43.686 --> 42:45.104
HOBAN (on tape): <i>They were, uh,</i>

42:47.314 --> 42:50.943
<i>they were there.</i>
<i>I mean, you know how that goes, right?</i>

42:54.113 --> 42:56.490
(scoffs, chuckles)

43:03.205 --> 43:04.498
It's over, Bobby.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.212
Yeah, it's over.

43:12.590 --> 43:16.635
But you know, Captain,
I think Eddie Hoban's confessed to a crime

43:16.719 --> 43:19.430
he doesn't even remember doing.

43:21.265 --> 43:24.226
And because of that,
I may not sleep at night.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.988
(cassette player clicks off)

43:42.995 --> 43:44.246
Thank you, sir.

43:45.539 --> 43:46.582
Thank you.

43:52.004 --> 43:55.049
<i>But what I found there</i>
<i>was hardly what I'd expected.</i>

43:55.132 --> 43:57.509
<i>This precinct's captain is a soft-spoken,</i>

43:57.593 --> 44:01.513
<i>but unmistakably tough,</i>
<i>veteran of 17 years of police work,</i>

44:01.597 --> 44:04.266
<i>the last two years of which</i>
<i>have been spent on the Hill.</i>

44:04.350 --> 44:07.311
<i>What two years on the Hill</i>
<i>boils down to statistically</i>

44:07.394 --> 44:10.981
<i>is 482 homicides, and literally thousands</i>

44:11.065 --> 44:14.818
<i>of felony robberies,</i>
<i>assaults, rape/assaults,</i>

44:14.902 --> 44:17.696
<i>and more casual violence in an afternoon</i>

44:17.780 --> 44:19.990
<i>than most of us will</i>
<i>experience in a lifetime.</i>

44:20.074 --> 44:23.577
<i>The job of the 238 men</i>
<i>and women of Hill Street</i>

44:23.661 --> 44:26.580
<i>is primarily to keep the lid on</i>

44:26.664 --> 44:28.415
<i>one's sense of right and wrong,</i>

44:28.499 --> 44:31.210
<i>good or bad, justice or injustice.</i>

44:31.293 --> 44:33.962
<i>All these notions</i>
<i>take a backseat to simple survival</i>

44:34.046 --> 44:36.298
<i>from what's out there on the streets.</i>

44:36.382 --> 44:38.300
<i>Here's some of what it was like:</i>

44:38.384 --> 44:42.262
<i>Here are some of the people.</i>
<i>The driver is Officer Renko.</i>

44:42.346 --> 44:44.348
-Sweetie.
<i>-His partner, Officer Hill.</i>

44:44.431 --> 44:47.351
<i>We rolled early that morning--</i>
<i>(continues, indistinct)</i>

44:47.434 --> 44:50.396
-Thanks for meeting me.
-Thank you.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.940
You're a famous guy, pizza man.

44:53.023 --> 44:55.317
Bartender, a club soda for my nephew.

44:57.111 --> 45:00.280
-Is she killing us?
-Surprisingly not.

45:00.364 --> 45:03.200
CYNTHIA (on TV):
<i>This footage was shot while on patrol</i>

45:03.283 --> 45:06.829
<i>with two young Hill Street officers</i>
<i>named Harris and Santini.</i>

45:06.912 --> 45:09.164
<i>Five days later, Officer Harris would die</i>

45:09.248 --> 45:12.042
<i>during a routine investigation</i>
<i>of robbery suspects.</i>

45:12.126 --> 45:14.294
<i>A mere week after his partner's death,</i>

45:14.378 --> 45:16.922
<i>Officer Santini would</i>
<i>resign from the force.</i>

45:17.005 --> 45:19.466
<i>The physical toll of such</i>
<i>random acts of violence</i>

45:19.550 --> 45:21.510
<i>is a simple matter of statistics.</i>

45:22.845 --> 45:25.806
<i>The psychological effects</i>
<i>upon the officers who must return daily--</i>

45:26.682 --> 45:29.268
She's going places, Frank.
This is good stuff.

45:30.018 --> 45:33.313
<i>-</i>CYNTHIA (on TV): <i>The station house...</i>
-(pager beeping)

45:33.397 --> 45:34.857
(sighs)

45:35.899 --> 45:37.776
I'll be right back.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.991
<i>...not to mention the overwhelming number</i>
<i>of criminal suspects</i>

45:44.074 --> 45:46.201
<i>that strain its facilities 24 hours a day.</i>

45:47.161 --> 45:49.538
<i>Far from offering</i>
<i>a respite to its officers,</i>

45:49.621 --> 45:51.749
<i>Hill Street Station</i>
<i>literally assaults them</i>

45:51.832 --> 45:55.210
<i>with a harsh, untempered</i>
<i>focusing of the violence and despair</i>

45:55.294 --> 45:57.588
<i>that flourishes just outside its walls.</i>

45:57.671 --> 45:59.298
<i>When viewed from this perspective,</i>

45:59.381 --> 46:02.092
<i>it's not too difficult</i>
<i>to understand the siege mentality</i>

46:02.176 --> 46:05.679
<i>and severe emotional stress</i>
<i>apparent in so many of its officers.</i>

46:13.228 --> 46:17.357
-Yeah, Phil.
<i>-Bad situation, Francis.</i>

46:17.441 --> 46:21.403
The Dekker Avenue people
tried mixing it up with the Gypsy Boys.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.030
What happened?

46:23.697 --> 46:25.282
We have one dead merchant.

46:25.824 --> 46:27.034
Marone!

46:27.493 --> 46:29.077
<i>(TV continues)</i>

46:29.161 --> 46:31.872
Could I trouble you again, please?
Thank you.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.876
You're not gonna believe this one.

46:35.959 --> 46:38.504
One of your Dekker Avenue
merchants was killed.

46:38.587 --> 46:40.380
They interrupted with a news bulletin.

46:40.464 --> 46:43.884
<i>Drug use is rampant, as is prostitution,</i>

46:43.967 --> 46:47.763
<i>juvenile-gang warfare,</i>
<i>and the terrible causes of it all.</i>

46:47.846 --> 46:51.308
<i>Causes which are all too easily cited</i>
<i>on a journalistic level.</i>

46:52.893 --> 46:55.270
(rain falling)

47:05.489 --> 47:08.367
-How are you, Hector?
-Surviving, bro. How about you?

47:08.450 --> 47:10.285
Uh, not so good. You wanna sit down?

47:11.328 --> 47:13.330
We are having trouble placing you.

47:14.373 --> 47:17.918
They have waiting lists. You know that.
And limited funding and...

47:20.212 --> 47:22.840
(thunder rumbling)

47:22.923 --> 47:26.218
Look, I gotta be straight with you,
Hector. Your record scares 'em off.

47:27.594 --> 47:29.721
They think I'm a scary dude now?

47:29.805 --> 47:31.598
Well, let me tell you something, Frank.

47:31.682 --> 47:34.268
You tell 'em they ain't seen nothing yet.
All right? Nothing.

47:34.351 --> 47:37.604
You listen up, young man.
You may be a minor legally,

47:37.688 --> 47:39.773
but you're a major-league
offender who has shown

47:39.857 --> 47:42.442
absolutely no inclination
whatsoever to change.

47:42.526 --> 47:45.404
Now, I and a lot of other people,
including Ms. Davenport,

47:45.487 --> 47:47.281
have busted their humps on your behalf.

47:47.364 --> 47:48.991
And I want something in exchange.

47:49.700 --> 47:50.951
What?

47:51.034 --> 47:54.538
Six months. Six lousy months, man,

47:54.621 --> 47:56.123
without you getting into any beefs,

47:56.206 --> 47:58.709
and without alienating everyone
who tries to help you.

47:59.418 --> 48:01.420
Six months here, or wherever
else they send you,

48:01.503 --> 48:04.339
without running away and
sticking up some supermarket.

48:04.423 --> 48:05.465
Then, maybe,

48:06.592 --> 48:08.427
maybe we got a shot.

48:08.510 --> 48:10.888
Come on, Frank.
Those places don't want me, man.

48:10.971 --> 48:13.557
They're looking for some little
nothin' who thinks that, uh,

48:13.640 --> 48:15.350
that spitting in the subway's a big deal.

48:15.434 --> 48:18.103
You know something, Hector?
You may be absolutely right.

48:18.186 --> 48:20.105
But how in the hell are we
going to find that out

48:20.188 --> 48:21.523
unless you meet me halfway, hm?

48:24.610 --> 48:27.571
It's this place, man.
If I can only get outta here, you know?

48:28.155 --> 48:30.073
You people don't know
what it's like in there.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.199
I do know.

48:33.619 --> 48:36.955
But, you're gonna have to stay in it,
in order to get out of it.

48:37.039 --> 48:38.874
Six months, Hector. What do you say?

48:41.752 --> 48:43.503
I ain't making no promises.

48:45.005 --> 48:46.131
But, uh,

48:47.341 --> 48:49.134
I'll give it a try. All right, Frank?

48:49.718 --> 48:50.928
I'll try.

48:52.054 --> 48:53.513
Yeah, all right.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.819
(theme music playing)
