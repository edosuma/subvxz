00:06.939 --> 00:08.173
- Uhh!

00:08.175 --> 00:09.041
Ooh!

00:10.977 --> 00:13.479
Uhh! Uhh!

00:13.481 --> 00:15.514
Ahh!

00:15.516 --> 00:17.116
- You're gonna break it.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.451
- I think I know
my own recliner.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.753
Sometimes it just sticks.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.921
Got to give it
a little uhh!

00:22.923 --> 00:24.923
Got to give it
a little aah!

00:24.925 --> 00:26.859
But sometimes it knows
you're gonna do that,

00:26.861 --> 00:30.863
So you've got to
surprise it with
a little hah!

00:30.865 --> 00:33.332
Hah! Hyah! Hah!

00:33.334 --> 00:34.767
Hyah! Hah!

00:37.237 --> 00:38.270
Wah!

[music playing
on television]

01:09.302 --> 01:12.004
- Uh, maybe it's time
to buy a new recliner.

01:12.006 --> 01:16.975
- Buy a new recliner?
Easy for you to say,
moneybags bunny.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.111
But unlike you,
I wasn't born

01:19.113 --> 01:21.947
With a silver carrot
in my mouth.

01:21.949 --> 01:22.815
- Well, then get it fixed.

01:22.817 --> 01:26.385
- Why? If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

01:27.520 --> 01:28.954
Ooh!

01:28.956 --> 01:31.423
[groans]

01:31.425 --> 01:32.458
- It is broke.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.927
- It's an expression, bugs.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.095
Lord, you're ignorant.

01:36.097 --> 01:39.965
My point is, I'm perfectly
content with it like this.

01:39.967 --> 01:40.766
- Well, I'm not.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.468
It takes up half the room
this way.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.636
And I'm not watching tv
upside down.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.205
- [scoffs]
you're so prickly.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.207
Everything has to be
just so with you.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.542
It's like you can't adapt.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.944
Ohh! My eyes!

01:51.946 --> 01:55.948
The sudden change in lighting.
I can't adapt to it.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.549
[sobbing]

01:57.851 --> 02:02.121
Why is it so hard
for you to admit that
you lost, porky?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.856
- [stammering]
I didn't lose.

02:03.858 --> 02:06.325
In golf,
the lowest score wins.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.993
- That doesn't make
any sense.

02:07.995 --> 02:09.828
Everyone knows
that in sports,

02:09.830 --> 02:11.530
The highest score wins.

02:11.532 --> 02:16.001
You got a 75.
I got a 308.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.369
I dominated you.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.772

What in the name of
randall mcclintock is this?

02:28.115 --> 02:30.782
- Ooh, a new recliner.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.850
- What do you think?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.785
- Are you responsible
for this?

02:33.787 --> 02:35.187
- Well, your old one
was broken.

02:35.189 --> 02:38.123
This one's brand new.
It's leather.

02:38.125 --> 02:41.193
- No, absolutely not.
Take it back.

02:41.195 --> 02:41.827
- Why?

02:41.829 --> 02:42.961
I think it's nice.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.663
- Oh, now I definitely
don't want it.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.166
Porky has the worst taste
of anyone I know.

02:47.168 --> 02:49.201
- You think I have
bad taste?

02:49.203 --> 02:50.202
- Look in the mirror, man.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.271
What's with those shoes?
They're crazy.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.206
They have little spikes
on the bottom.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.040
Who does that?

02:55.042 --> 02:56.108
- They're golf shoes.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.709
- Well, what's with
the one glove?

02:57.711 --> 02:59.778
Who do you think you are,
michael jackson?

02:59.780 --> 03:03.782
I met michael jackson,
and you are no michael jackson.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.817
- It's a golf glove.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.519
- When did you meet
michael jackson?

03:07.521 --> 03:09.254
- I met him at
the denver airport.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.289
But that's not the point.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.457
The point is,
I want my old recliner back.

03:12.459 --> 03:15.127
- It's too late.
I donated it to
a thrift store.

03:15.129 --> 03:20.632
- Porky, I'm gonna need
a moment alone with my roommate.

03:20.634 --> 03:24.503
Not my friend,
my roommate.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.271
- Oh, uh, ok.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.172
[crash]

03:27.174 --> 03:28.840
- That was a garbage move.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.877
- Getting you a brand new
recliner was a garbage move?

03:31.879 --> 03:35.214
- That recliner meant
everything to me.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.748
- Why?
- Why?

03:36.750 --> 03:38.850
It was my sole possession.

03:38.852 --> 03:39.751
- What are you talking about?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.620
You got a bedroom
full of stuff.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.422
- Yes, but all of that
is either rented,

03:43.424 --> 03:46.792
Found in a dumpster,
or I'm borrowing it from porky.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.962
That recliner I bought
with my own money.

03:49.964 --> 03:52.798
It was the summer
after graduation.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.934
I was working at
that-a-burger.

03:55.936 --> 03:56.868
It was miserable.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.838
6 days a week,
10 hours a day,

03:59.840 --> 04:02.274
Standing over
those grease traps,

04:02.276 --> 04:04.543
Slinging 80% beef patties.

04:04.545 --> 04:08.213
I used to fantasize
about sitting down

04:08.448 --> 04:10.015
With my feet up,

04:10.017 --> 04:12.517
Just relaxing.

04:12.519 --> 04:18.690
Then one day on my walk
home from yet another
nightmare shift,

04:18.692 --> 04:23.996
I looked up and there it was
in the storefront window.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.431
I knew if I could just
sit in it once,

04:26.433 --> 04:29.701
I would sit in it
for the rest of my life.

04:29.703 --> 04:33.105
But they said
I had to buy it.

04:34.107 --> 04:37.442
It took me all summer
to make enough money,

04:37.444 --> 04:40.012
But once I did,
I quit that job,

04:40.014 --> 04:45.517
Bought that recliner,
and I've been sitting in it
ever since.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.819
Until today.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.522
- Wow. I had no idea.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.091
I feel terrible.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.092
Come on.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.327
- Where are we going?

04:55.329 --> 04:59.131
- To get your recliner back.

05:01.034 --> 05:04.836
- Uh, guys?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.838
Hello?

05:07.273 --> 05:11.276
- I can't believe someone
already bought my recliner.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.212
- Neither can I.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.283
- Now what am I gonna do?

05:18.285 --> 05:19.618
Where am I gonna sit?

05:19.620 --> 05:21.853
- In the new recliner
I got you.

05:21.855 --> 05:22.954
It's very comfortable.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.757
Give it a try.
Maybe you'll like it.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.826
Think of it as
a new beginning,

05:27.828 --> 05:28.760
A fresh start.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.029
When one door closes,
another one opens.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.764
That's what makes life
interesting.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.967
You never know what's
gonna happen next.

05:36.636 --> 05:37.703
[crunch]
- ooh!

05:37.705 --> 05:41.807
- Bet you didn't know
that was gonna happen.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.109
- Are you ok?

05:44.111 --> 05:45.944
- You hit me.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.946
Buges buney?

05:47.948 --> 05:48.814
- Cecil?

05:48.816 --> 05:50.515
Here, let me help you up.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.918
I'm so sorry.
Are you hurt?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.353
- No, I think I'm ok.

05:54.355 --> 05:58.156
Just a little startled,
maybe.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.092
- Uh-oh.
- What?

06:00.094 --> 06:02.928
- Did you always have
a crack in your shell?

06:02.930 --> 06:05.497
- Oh, no,
my shell is cracked.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.966
- Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.
I have insurance.

06:07.968 --> 06:11.670
- Oh, no, I don't want you
to have to go through
all that trouble.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.772
Let's handle this
like gentlemen.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.507
I have a shell guy
I go to.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.376
He's very reasonable.

06:17.378 --> 06:18.677
- Well, whatever the cost.

06:18.679 --> 06:21.346
Whatever it is,
I'll be happy to pay for it.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.581
Here's my number.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.950
- I'll be in touch.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.151
Ohh.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.419
Uhh.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.187
Uhh. Uhh.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.255
[starts engine]

06:30.257 --> 06:31.156
- What are you doing?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.992
- I think you've done
enough damage for one day.

06:33.994 --> 06:39.331
Being behind the wheel
of a car is a tremendous
responsibility, bugs.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.200
It requires concentration
and focus.

06:42.202 --> 06:45.871
That's how you avoid
accidents.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.248
- So, what do you think?

06:56.250 --> 06:57.916
- What kind of leather
is this?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.851
- I don't know. Leather.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.421
- Is it corinthian
or cordovan?

07:02.423 --> 07:04.022
Or is it even leather at all?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.925
I mean, it feels like
naugahyde.

07:06.927 --> 07:07.759
- It's leather.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.595
- It makes a weird sound
when I move like this.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.597
- Well, then stop
moving like that.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.665
- I don't think I like it.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.801
- Daffy, you're the only
person in the world

07:15.803 --> 07:17.135
That wouldn't like
this recliner.

07:17.137 --> 07:20.939
- Ugh. Where did you get
this hideous recliner?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.341
- See? Told you.
It's going back.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.677
- What?
It's just one opinion.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.947
- Uh, one professional
opinion.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.015
- You're not a professional.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.918
- Uh, no, but I watch
"design divas" every week,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.287
So I think I know
what I'm talking about.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.922
- What is "design divas"?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.590
- It's the design show
where diva decorators

07:38.592 --> 07:42.294
Change other divas' lives
one piece of furniture
at a time.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.963
- Hello! We have
a season pass to it.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.798
How have you never seen it?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.868
Ugh. Always with
the reading, this guy.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.169
- What happened to
your old recliner?

07:51.171 --> 07:54.639
- Brainiac over there thought
he was doing me a favor

07:54.641 --> 07:55.507
By throwing it away

07:55.509 --> 07:59.511
And giving me this--
this naugahyde nightmare.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.980
- It's beyond horrible.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.952
- It's nice.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.421
- Bugs, you're good
in a lot of areas,

08:09.423 --> 08:10.922
But home decor is
not one of them.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.925
You just don't see things
the way we do.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.360
[telephone rings]

08:15.362 --> 08:17.095
- That's an understatement.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.331
[ring]

08:19.333 --> 08:20.699
[ring]

08:20.701 --> 08:21.500
Hello?

08:21.502 --> 08:22.834
- Buges, it's cecil.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.669
- Oh, hi.
How are you?

08:24.671 --> 08:26.304
- The turtle.
- Yeah, right.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.340
- The one you hit
with your car this morning.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.375
- No, yeah, I know
exactly who this is.

08:30.377 --> 08:34.712
- Ok, well, I just dropped
my shell off with my shell guy

08:34.715 --> 08:38.750
And the crack is worse
than we thought.

08:38.751 --> 08:40.818
- Oh, no.
What does that mean?

08:40.821 --> 08:44.022
- It means he's
gonna need $2,000.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.957
- $2,000 to fix your shell?

08:45.959 --> 08:50.362
- Oh, no, the 2,000 is
just to go in and see
what the problem is.

08:50.364 --> 08:53.798
He has to determine
if it's a surface crack

08:53.800 --> 08:55.767
Or a sub-stratum crack.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.369
If it's a sub-stratum crack,

08:57.371 --> 09:00.805
That could end up costing
as much as 35.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.474
- 3,500?

09:02.476 --> 09:03.942
- 35,000.

09:03.944 --> 09:04.776
- [gulps]

09:04.778 --> 09:09.414
- But fingers crossed
it's a surface crack.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.917
So you want to drop
that check off?

09:11.919 --> 09:15.754
I'd come by and get it,
but I probably shouldn't
leave the house.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.757
You know, turtle
without a shell.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.958
Highly vulnerable.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.161
- Oh, of course.
What's your address?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.663
- 4123--

09:24.665 --> 09:25.931
- Can I have your credit card?

09:25.933 --> 09:26.665
- My credit card?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.600
- Oh, actually,
I'd prefer a check.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.202
- No, I'm sorry,
I wasn't talking to you.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.771
Why do you need
my credit card?

09:32.773 --> 09:34.639
- We're exchanging
the recliner.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.473
- Hello?

09:35.475 --> 09:36.508
- Oh, uh, sorry.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.375
Can you say that again?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.711
- We are exchanging
the recliner.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.947
- Not you.
No, I'm sorry,

09:41.949 --> 09:43.815
I wasn't talking to you.

09:43.817 --> 09:44.916
Here.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.953
Sorry.
One more time, cecil.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.455
- 4123 helms way.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.624
- Sorry.
Where'd you buy it?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.459
- Home warehouse.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.761
- No. Helms way.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.164
Why would I live
at home warehouse?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.031
- It's not important.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.133
I'll stop by
with the check.

10:02.135 --> 10:02.934
[beep]

10:02.936 --> 10:04.869
- Can you help us carry
the recliner to the car?

10:04.871 --> 10:07.606
It's real heavy.

10:08.774 --> 10:12.177
- Great day of the morning.
This place is huge.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.745
We've been walking around
for an hour

10:13.747 --> 10:15.914
And just got out of
the kitchen section.

10:15.916 --> 10:16.982
Where are we now?

10:16.984 --> 10:17.983
- Hmm. I don't know.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.018
It's either textiles
and rugs

10:20.020 --> 10:23.121
Or storage solutions.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.426
- A scarf basket?

10:28.428 --> 10:30.261
Who needs a scarf basket?

10:30.263 --> 10:31.830
- Ooh! Look over here!

10:31.832 --> 10:32.831
- You found the recliners?

10:32.833 --> 10:35.300
- No, it's a complete
closet organizing system.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.503
See, everything is
divided into little baskets.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.138
- Baskets. Genius.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.773
- All of your t-shirts
go in here,

10:41.775 --> 10:42.974
Socks and underwear here.

10:42.976 --> 10:43.975
This is for your sweaters.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.977
- What about my scarves?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.078
- Look, scarf baskets.

10:47.080 --> 10:52.350
- Ohh, my mornings would
go so much quicker if
my closet looked like this.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.785
- Hmph. Tell me about it.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.855
- You know,
about 7 years ago,
I quit wearing clothes

10:56.857 --> 10:59.591
Because my closet
was so disorganized.

10:59.593 --> 11:00.792
I just gave up.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.528
- Oh. Em. Gee.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.696
- You found the recliners?

11:04.698 --> 11:07.766
- More like patio furniture
and outdoor dining!

11:07.768 --> 11:09.868
- Ooh! Wait for me!

11:15.441 --> 11:18.510
- Oh, mr. Buney.
Forgive my appearance.

11:18.911 --> 11:21.946
Let me go and get a robe.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.283
- I just wanted
to give you your check.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.786
- Oh, that's so nice of you.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.354
$2,000. Yep.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.623
This should get
the ball rolling.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.824
- How are you feeling?

11:32.826 --> 11:35.627
- Oh, you know,
not good.

11:35.629 --> 11:39.831
- I'm really sorry.
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

11:39.833 --> 11:43.101
- Well, I suppose
I could use some groceries.

11:43.103 --> 11:43.868
- Oh.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.704
- I mean, I'd go
and get them myself,

11:45.706 --> 11:48.206
But a turtle
without a shell...

11:48.208 --> 11:50.542
- Right. Highly vulnerable.

11:50.544 --> 11:52.143
- Here's a list.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.779
- You, uh, had that
ready to go, huh?

11:54.781 --> 11:57.449
- I'd really appreciate it.

11:57.451 --> 12:01.152
- Ok. I'll be right back.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.954
- [chuckles]

12:02.956 --> 12:05.790
[cackles]

12:08.728 --> 12:10.962
- Were you just laughing?

12:10.964 --> 12:11.863
- What? No.

12:11.865 --> 12:15.433
- It sounded like
the evil laugh of
a cartoon villain.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.502
- Oh, don't be silly.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.806
I mean, do I look
like a cartoon villain?

12:22.842 --> 12:26.478
- Who are you looking at?

12:37.790 --> 12:39.457
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.093
I'm on with my shell guy.

12:44.063 --> 12:47.832
- So you're saying
it can't be repaired?

12:47.834 --> 12:50.769
You're gonna have to make
a brand new custom shell?

12:50.771 --> 12:55.140
I don't even want to ask
how much that's gonna cost.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.142
Of course, I'll hold.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.510
He's pricing it out for me.

12:58.512 --> 13:01.746
Looks like it's gonna be
a little more than we hoped.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.782
- Hmm. What a shocker.

13:03.784 --> 13:07.619
Where would you like me
to put all this caviar I bought?

13:07.621 --> 13:08.686
- Fridge is fine.

13:08.688 --> 13:12.690
Oh, good, you remembered
the bubbly.

13:12.692 --> 13:13.825
Oh, yes, hi.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.094
Did you come up
with a figure?

13:16.096 --> 13:17.796
Oh, boy.
Oh, brother.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.464
Oh, brother.
Oh, boy.

13:19.466 --> 13:23.368
He says you're looking
at $53,000.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.435
- Let me talk to him.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.105
- Oh, uh, uh, you can't.

13:27.107 --> 13:27.972
- Why not?

13:27.974 --> 13:29.974
- Because he, um,
doesn't speak english.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.442
- You were just talking
to him in english.

13:31.444 --> 13:35.246
- Oh, well, he can understand
it, he just can't speak it.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.648
- Give me that phone.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.650
- Bonjour to you, too.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.951
He hung up.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.787
So about that $53,000.

13:42.789 --> 13:46.591
- You know what, unfortunately,
my checkbook's at home.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.793
- Well, you know
where to find me.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.662
[cackles]

13:50.664 --> 13:53.431
Just clearing my throat.
A little parched.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.935
Gonna go ahead and open
that bubbly.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.605
[cackles]

14:09.849 --> 14:13.918
- Oh, that's nice.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.120
Oh, hello, mommy.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.989
That is good for
the circulation.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.758
I am really feeling
that circulation.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.461
Let's see what else
she does.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.764
Oh, that's good.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.099
That's a nice feeling
right there.

14:28.101 --> 14:33.271
Ooh! Maybe that's a little
too much of that feeling.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.440
Whoops!
Probably needed that.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.942
Little--little help here.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.177
Daffy!

14:39.179 --> 14:41.246
Daffy!

14:43.282 --> 14:44.182
- Cool bed.

14:44.184 --> 14:47.685
- Ooh, that is quite a ride,
my friend.

14:47.687 --> 14:48.753
Where were you?

14:48.755 --> 14:49.921
- Looking for recliners.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.956
And I had to use
the bathroom.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.958
- You went over there?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.593
- Mm-hmm.
Very european.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.362
No doors.
No judgment.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.530
- Um, how do I say this?

14:59.532 --> 15:04.168
I think those are
display toilets.

15:05.471 --> 15:09.874
- What do you say we keep
looking for those recliners?

15:09.876 --> 15:12.744
Away from this area.

15:16.448 --> 15:21.419
- Let's find out a little more
about cecil the turtle.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.955
Hmm. Here we go.

15:23.957 --> 15:27.825
A news article.
"turtle hit by motorist."

15:27.827 --> 15:29.627
This is from 6 years ago.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.997
"cecil the turtle
was struck in a crosswalk.

15:32.999 --> 15:36.935
"driver claimed he
came out of nowhere.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.938
Awarded $40,000
in damages."

15:39.940 --> 15:41.005
Here's another one.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.409
"turtle out for stroll
struck by minivan."

15:44.411 --> 15:46.778
There's tons of these.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.848
You miserable little--

15:50.850 --> 15:52.283
[door opens]
- bugs!

15:52.285 --> 15:53.318
Oh, no.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.585
What have I done?

15:54.587 --> 15:55.787
What have I done?

15:55.789 --> 15:57.989
- Calm down.
Calm down.

15:57.991 --> 15:58.957
What happened?

15:58.959 --> 16:01.926
- I almost killed someone.
- What?

16:01.928 --> 16:04.495
- I hit a pedestrian
with my car.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.331
I never even saw him.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.932
Poor thing.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.201
It's like he came out
of nowhere.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.869
- Came out of nowhere, huh?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.538
- And I cracked his shell.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.606
He's so vulnerable now.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.175
I gave him $10,000,

16:17.177 --> 16:19.844
But that's just for
the initial estimate.

16:19.846 --> 16:20.912
It'll probably be more.

16:20.914 --> 16:24.615
He's waiting to hear back
from his shell guy.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.417
Ohh, I hope he's ok.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.786
- Why don't we go
check on him?

16:28.788 --> 16:31.756
- I can't believe
I got kicked out for
using the toilet.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.491
Last time I got
kicked out of a place,

16:33.493 --> 16:35.026
It was for not using one.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.161
Figure it out, america.

16:37.163 --> 16:37.996
- On the bright side,

16:37.998 --> 16:39.464
I got the closet
organizing system.

16:39.466 --> 16:45.203
- I guess I just have to
get used to life
without a recliner.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.872
[knock on door]

16:48.040 --> 16:51.943
- Oh, mr. Pig.
I wasn't expecting to see you.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.478
I just heard back
from my shell guy.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.347
I'm afraid it's gonna
cost more than we'd hoped.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.350
Oh! Mr. Buney, what are you
doing here?

16:59.352 --> 17:02.920
- I'm shutting down
your little shell game.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.123
Well, look at that.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.959
Your shell looks
as good as new.

17:07.961 --> 17:09.260
- Oh, well, uh,

17:09.262 --> 17:12.964
My shell guy
just fixed it.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.299
- So you wear a fake
cracked shell

17:15.300 --> 17:17.502
To scam people
out of their money.

17:17.503 --> 17:19.503
Not anymore.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.772
Come on, porky.
We're going to the police.

17:21.775 --> 17:25.943
- I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.679
Drop the shell.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.449
Hands up.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.818
Both of you.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.820
Now kick it over to me.

17:38.023 --> 17:40.858
- [gasps]

17:41.060 --> 17:43.127
Where'd you get that recliner?

17:43.129 --> 17:44.128
- This old thing?

17:44.130 --> 17:46.431
I picked it up
at the thrift store.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.332
That was where I spotted you.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.334
You were the perfect mark.

17:50.336 --> 17:52.003
- I got to hand it
to you, cecil.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.072
You're a criminal
mastermind.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.807
- Why, thank you very much.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.008
- If you don't
mind me asking,

17:57.010 --> 17:59.410
How did you come up
with this scheme?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.511
- Well, it's a long story,

18:00.513 --> 18:02.747
But since I'm gonna
shoot you anyway,

18:02.749 --> 18:04.449
What's the harm?

18:04.451 --> 18:05.616
- Mind if we sit down?

18:05.618 --> 18:09.287
- Why not? I mean,
we're all gentlemen.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.588
[humming]

18:10.590 --> 18:14.158
I was living in atlantic city,
working at that-a-burger.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.961
I didn't have
two dimes to rub together.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.963
But I had big dreams.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.198
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

18:20.200 --> 18:24.368
But wouldn't you be
more comfortable reclined?

18:24.370 --> 18:25.369
- What?

18:25.537 --> 18:28.573
Oh! I just thought
it was a chair.

18:28.575 --> 18:32.610
I didn't know it was
a recline--aah!

18:32.845 --> 18:36.080
- Hold on to this.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.782
Uh-oh.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.785
Looks like you cracked
your shell.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.321
- Ohh.

18:55.467 --> 19:00.204
- ¶ there are things in life
that are amazing ¶

19:00.339 --> 19:04.108
¶ like stargazing,
Sunday lazing ¶

19:04.110 --> 19:05.943

20:20.453 --> 20:26.991
¶ but one day I hope
he's my son-in-law ¶

20:26.993 --> 20:28.826
- [kiss]

20:29.127 --> 20:31.095
- ¶ he's handsome
and considerate ¶

20:31.097 --> 20:32.763
¶ articulate and literate

20:32.765 --> 20:33.931
¶ loquacious and vivacious

20:33.933 --> 20:35.800
¶ his garage is
very spacious ¶

20:35.802 --> 20:42.807
¶ he's wonderful,
wonderful bugs ¶

20:42.874 --> 20:44.275
[cheers and applause]

20:44.277 --> 20:47.445
- Mwah!

20:48.914 --> 20:50.348
- I know what
the surprise is.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.350
You went back to
home warehouse

20:52.352 --> 20:54.852
And got me that
leather recliner again.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.921
You were right.
It was great.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.523
It was way better
than my old recliner.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.125
That thing was
a piece of junk.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.827
I don't know why
I was holding on to it.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.862
I'm glad it's out
of my life.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.298
If I never see
my old recliner again,

21:07.300 --> 21:08.332
It'll be too soon.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.668
So thank you.
Thank you, my friend.

21:10.670 --> 21:15.973
I am so excited to sit
in that leather recliner.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.242
Oh.

21:18.244 --> 21:21.746
- You miserable little...
