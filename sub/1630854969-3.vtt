WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:03.090
Previously on
"Gotham Knights"...

00:03.090 --> 00:05.092
They think I killed my dad

00:05.092 --> 00:06.571
because I wanted
his money?

00:06.571 --> 00:08.269
We didn't kill your dad
any more than you did.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.487
We're gonna
clear our names.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.054
We're a lot of things
but we're not cops.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.882
But whoever is behind it
is gonna make sure

00:12.882 --> 00:14.057
we have a little accident.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.191
Who the hell
are you?

00:17.191 --> 00:18.061
I'm Robin.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.758
So, you knew
my dad was Batman?

00:19.758 --> 00:20.846
Mutant Gang
threw him off the roof

00:20.846 --> 00:22.022
of my apartment.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.414
I dragged him to safety.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.937
Not a bad way
to meet your hero.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.374
Turner, he didn't want you

00:26.374 --> 00:28.071
to follow down that path.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.638
I swiped this from Ford
during our escape.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.727
It's the symbol of
the Court of Owls.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.381
They're the ones who
really run this city.

00:33.381 --> 00:36.558
Have you forgotten
your debt of gratitude?

00:36.558 --> 00:39.082
Just keep me in office so
I can continue to repay it.

00:39.082 --> 00:41.258
We need to find out
everything we can
about who's after us.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.260
We got Bruce's journals.
Records of all of his cases.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.088
Come on. Let's go.
Anything interesting?

00:45.088 --> 00:46.916
They ripped out
his final entry.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.744
Whoever it was doesn't want us
to know what he wrote.

01:00.451 --> 01:01.452
Watch it now.

01:19.644 --> 01:21.255
You lost, little girl?

01:21.255 --> 01:24.127
Yeah, I'm looking for
my Batarang.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.172
Have you seen it?

01:27.696 --> 01:30.742
Oh. There it is.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.128
Nice try.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.782
Ha ha.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.525
Aha. Ha.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.189
Ahh.

03:10.755 --> 03:13.889
You OK?
I'm great.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.195
Then I assume there's

03:15.195 --> 03:18.285
someone somewhere
who's not great.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.896
Yep. Guy about the size
of a refrigerator.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.594
Bit of a temper.
Goes by the name
Vernon Wagner.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.727
Wait, you went up
against the leader
of the Mutant Gang?

03:25.727 --> 03:28.599
More like he
went up against me.
And lost.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.907
I've been tracking
them for weeks.

03:31.907 --> 03:34.910
Got to say, worth it.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.086
So--so are they called
the Mutant Gang

03:37.086 --> 03:39.131
'cause they're actually,
like, mutated

03:39.131 --> 03:40.655
or just 'cause
it sounds scary?

03:40.655 --> 03:42.657
I'm thinking they're
a little less scary

03:42.657 --> 03:44.093
without their leader.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.616
Oh.
Nice work.

03:45.616 --> 03:46.661
Thank you very much.

03:48.140 --> 03:51.013
This one was kind of
personal, actually.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.928
Probably should have
thanked the Mutant Leader.

03:52.928 --> 03:53.885
He's the reason
I met your dad.

03:53.885 --> 03:55.060
And became his sidekick.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.584
Yeah, you mentioned that.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.107
So did my dad.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.457
He wrote about it
in his journals.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.285
So, how does that happen?

04:02.285 --> 04:04.026
Is there, like,
a application process?

04:04.026 --> 04:05.897
Batman took out an ad
in the "Gotham Gazette"?

04:05.897 --> 04:07.508
Like "Mini-Bat wanted"?

04:07.508 --> 04:09.597
The Mutant Gang threw him
off a building

04:09.597 --> 04:10.946
in my neighborhood

04:10.946 --> 04:13.209
and I pulled him to safety.

04:13.209 --> 04:15.124
Oh, you saved
Gotham's savior.
That's cute.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.344
I was actually just
returning the favor.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.868
He'd been protecting
my neighborhood
since before I was born.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.957
I thought I owed it
to Batman to help him

04:21.957 --> 04:23.611
help the people
who needed it.

04:23.611 --> 04:25.265
Well, I look forward
to reading all about it

04:25.265 --> 04:26.527
in this little, uh...

04:29.181 --> 04:33.490
OK. Fine.
Maybe later.

04:33.490 --> 04:36.319
Anything in there that
can help us hunt down
the Court of Owls?

04:36.319 --> 04:38.321
A lot of
conspiracy theories.

04:38.321 --> 04:41.063
It's not exactly
a how-to on catching
my dad's killers.

04:41.063 --> 04:42.804
Nothing concrete.
I can't help thinking

04:42.804 --> 04:43.935
the most important pages
were the ones

04:43.935 --> 04:45.023
that were ripped out.

04:46.503 --> 04:51.160
Well, um, I have an
AP Bio exam to cram for.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.380
It's gonna do to me what
the Mutant Leader couldn't.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.172
Does it say in here
why daddy didn't

05:03.172 --> 05:05.870
pick you to be
his sidekick?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.916
I mean, Bat-points
for him not just doing

05:07.916 --> 05:10.092
the whole nepotism thing,
and clearly,

05:10.092 --> 05:12.573
Little Bird is qualified,
but I mean, come on,

05:12.573 --> 05:15.053
It's gotta sting, like,
a tiny, bitty bit

05:15.053 --> 05:16.881
that he just handed
his whole legacy to

05:16.881 --> 05:18.666
some random stranger, right?

05:20.537 --> 05:22.539
I'm sure he had his reasons.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.891
OK.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.680
News anchor: After the Mutant
Gang's reign of terror

05:32.680 --> 05:34.203
following the death of Batman,

05:34.203 --> 05:36.510
Gotham can sleep a bit
easier tonight

05:36.510 --> 05:38.903
now that Vernon Wagner,
also known by his

05:38.903 --> 05:41.036
nom de crime
"The Mutant Leader,"

05:41.036 --> 05:43.865
is safely
and, given his sheer size,

05:43.865 --> 05:46.433
snugly behind bars.

05:46.433 --> 05:49.044
Celebrating this victory
was Mayor Hill.

05:49.044 --> 05:52.221
Mayor Hill: On my order,
the brave men of the GCPD

05:52.221 --> 05:53.875
have captured
the degenerate leader

05:53.875 --> 05:56.399
of the Mutant Gang,
and starting today,

05:56.399 --> 05:59.010
we're deploying 100 more
officers to hunt down

05:59.010 --> 06:00.708
the rest of the Mutants.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.797
And I can think of
no better way to celebrate

06:02.797 --> 06:07.062
the taking back of our city than
at the Founders Gala tomorrow,

06:07.062 --> 06:10.152
knowing that we made the streets
of Gotham safer today.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.546
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!

06:12.546 --> 06:13.634
Is that really gonna work?

06:15.287 --> 06:18.073
Does it make the streets
of Gotham safer

06:18.073 --> 06:19.770
when you pressure,
one of my ADAs into

06:19.770 --> 06:21.903
dropping charges
against Brody March?

06:21.903 --> 06:23.731
Kid clearly
learned his lesson.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.950
Came down to the GCPD
to confess.

06:25.950 --> 06:29.476
Nobody got hurt
and no money was stolen.

06:29.476 --> 06:32.304
Right, because it was
donated to your
campaign coffers.

06:34.132 --> 06:37.745
How big a contribution
did Lincoln March make
to your re-election fund?

06:37.745 --> 06:39.486
Why? You trying to figure
out how much you gotta

06:39.486 --> 06:41.618
raise to beat me
by November?

06:41.618 --> 06:43.403
Or are you still
too scared to get
in the race?

06:45.013 --> 06:46.101
I'll see you at the gala.

06:57.895 --> 07:01.159
"GCPD Captures
Mutant Gang Leader."

07:01.159 --> 07:02.596
The press always
gets it wrong.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.252
We have AP English
together, right?

07:07.252 --> 07:10.125
I'm Stephanie,
you're Carrie,

07:10.125 --> 07:11.648
and we have a lot more
in common than that.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.086
Another case of
a man taking credit

07:15.086 --> 07:17.132
for a woman's work.

07:17.132 --> 07:19.569
I don't know
what you mean.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.528
Turner filled me in
on your extracurriculars.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.792
Can't be easy,
picking up the Bat-mantle.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.316
That why you're catching
extra Zs in the stacks?

07:29.361 --> 07:31.146
I don't care if
the cops took credit.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.325
I just wish Batman
was here to see me
take him down.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.327
You know,
I knew Bruce a little.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.156
He'd be proud of you.

07:43.854 --> 07:44.812
Hey, Steph.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.641
Um--

07:47.641 --> 07:49.164
Carrie.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.171
Well. I don't know
what's more surprising--

07:56.171 --> 07:58.652
to see you
actually in the library

07:58.652 --> 08:01.481
or to see you
not behind bars.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.483
Thanks again for that,
by the way.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.485
Got 3 months
community service.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.357
Of course your dad
got you off.

08:08.357 --> 08:11.839
Pays to be a March.
As long as a March pays.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.406
My parents are punishing me
in other ways. Trust me.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.671
Anyway, the reason
I'm here in the--

08:17.671 --> 08:20.761
what'd you call this place?
The... library?

08:20.761 --> 08:23.198
Ha. Is because
I wanted to ask you

08:23.198 --> 08:26.070
if you wanted to come to
the Founders Gala with me.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.768
I know you hate
those parties.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.944
I hate those parties,
but come with me.

08:31.423 --> 08:32.773
We can hate
the party together.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.558
Your dad legit
just got you out of jail.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.386
Is he gonna let you
out of the house?

08:37.386 --> 08:39.867
I told you my parents
were punishing me.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.782
This is the punishment.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.176
You in?

08:45.176 --> 08:46.700
You said yes?

08:46.700 --> 08:48.484
What was I supposed to say?

08:48.484 --> 08:51.531
Brody lied to the police
about hacking the banks.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.881
For me.
I kind of owe him.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.796
Yeah, I'm with
Brownie on this one.

08:55.796 --> 08:58.102
I mean, you got her into
trouble, he got her out, so,

08:58.102 --> 09:00.365
think that earns her
a ticket to the Brodeo.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.932
Please stay off my side.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.238
And I highly doubt
that me splitting

09:03.238 --> 09:04.718
a cheese platter
with Brody

09:04.718 --> 09:06.894
is your most
pressing concern.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.157
OK. Where are you
on your clue trail?

09:09.157 --> 09:11.681
At a dead end.
But check this out.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.770
My dad wrote about his theory
that the Court of Owls

09:13.770 --> 09:16.686
were hunting the Wayne
family for over 100 years.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.733
Starting with his
great-great-grandfather
Alan Wayne.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.430
But all the accounts
of the time say that

09:21.430 --> 09:23.127
he drowned in a sewer
when he accidentally

09:23.127 --> 09:25.086
fell into a manhole.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.088
Newspapers attributed it
to dementia but

09:27.088 --> 09:28.742
here's where
it gets interesting.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.352
Witnesses at
the time said that

09:30.352 --> 09:31.571
he was
last heard screaming,

09:31.571 --> 09:34.138
"The owls are in my house."

09:34.138 --> 09:35.923
That can't be
a coincidence.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.621
Yeah.
So, what now?

09:38.621 --> 09:41.189
Well, I know what
the World's Greatest
Detective would do.

09:41.189 --> 09:44.105
Can't solve the last murder,
go back to the first.

09:44.105 --> 09:46.281
If the Court did kill
Alan Wayne,

09:46.281 --> 09:48.457
maybe looking through
his cold case

09:48.457 --> 09:50.459
will help us prove
they killed my dad.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.113
Figure out how
they did it,
maybe see if

09:52.113 --> 09:53.854
we can find out
who was involved.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.116
It's a long shot.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.770
All cold cases
are long shots.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.293
But if you could
get your hands

09:58.293 --> 09:59.816
on the original case file,
maybe we could

09:59.816 --> 10:01.818
find something the police
missed back then.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.560
Yeah, if the original
case file

10:04.560 --> 10:07.650
wasn't collecting cobwebs
in the GCPD basement.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.173
Right.
Can't exactly just

10:09.173 --> 10:10.958
go and check it out.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.134
No, but we could steal it.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.528
How?
Why don't ya

10:16.528 --> 10:18.226
leave that to the thieves
to figure out?

10:32.022 --> 10:33.981
Woman on TV:
In a stunning development,

10:33.981 --> 10:36.679
the Mutant Gang has now
claimed responsibility for

10:36.679 --> 10:39.639
last night's downing
of a GCPD airship

10:39.639 --> 10:41.815
that crashed into Ace Chemicals,

10:41.815 --> 10:44.644
causing widespread fires
that at this moment

10:44.644 --> 10:46.167
have not been contained.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.821
If not for the brave efforts

10:47.821 --> 10:49.431
of Gotham's firefighters,

10:49.431 --> 10:50.911
toxic fumes
would have surely been

10:50.911 --> 10:52.564
unleashed upon the city.

10:52.564 --> 10:55.002
The motive behind
this senseless act of terror

10:55.002 --> 10:56.743
became clear when
the Mutant Gang

10:56.743 --> 10:59.180
threatened a wave of
retaliatory violence

10:59.180 --> 11:02.444
against those responsible
for the arrest of their leader.

11:02.444 --> 11:05.273
Wagner and his Mutants
are also suspected of being

11:05.273 --> 11:06.666
the masterminds behind the...

11:06.666 --> 11:08.842
You take down
the Mutants,

11:08.842 --> 11:11.105
the GCPD
takes the credit,

11:11.105 --> 11:14.543
and then the Mutants
take it out on
everybody but you.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.895
I'm not sure if Batman
would be proud of you,
but I sure am.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.860
Wait.
I'm going with you.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.732
This is my mess
and I'm gonna clean it up

11:29.732 --> 11:31.038
before anyone else
gets hurt.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.648
You don't have
to do it alone.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.694
You were my dad's backup.
Let me be yours.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.479
I appreciate the offer.
I really do.

11:37.479 --> 11:39.394
But you have enough to do
trying to clear your names.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.612
Not until we can
jailbreak that

11:40.612 --> 11:42.136
Alan Wayne file
out of the GCPD.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.920
Until then, I'm
out of breadcrumbs.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.140
You know we made a pretty
good team against the Talon.

11:46.140 --> 11:48.620
Maybe we treat the
Mutant Gang to a bit
of that teamwork.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.144
Look, the Talon is
a different story.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.711
It's one thing to get
pulled into danger.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.495
It's another to go
looking for it.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.671
You're a wanted fugitive,
Turner. It's too big of a risk.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.586
Is this about
me getting caught
or me getting hurt?

12:00.110 --> 12:01.590
It's about your dad
not wanting you

12:01.590 --> 12:03.331
to follow down
the same path.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.339
You can't just walk into
the GCPD and take evidence.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.428
You can if you're
in a cop uniform
holding these.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.605
Evidence transfer requests.
Some of my best work.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.740
Just a couple of hours in
the Gotham Academy Art Lab.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
Let me see.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.092
Oh. Looks like
the real deal to me.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.920
Your mug shot is
plastered all over the city.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.486
How are you not
gonna be recognized?

12:28.486 --> 12:30.445
I could help with that.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.925
Look, they only know me
as a scared kid.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.143
They're not expecting
a rookie cop.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.102
Yeah. Exactly.
Which you aren't.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.625
This is too dangerous.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.453
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.

12:38.453 --> 12:42.152
And you know what?
He can handle it.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.980
The Talon would have
turned me into a patty melt

12:43.980 --> 12:45.547
if he hadn't pulled me
out of that car.

12:45.547 --> 12:47.114
And, aah, your problem
is that you are

12:47.114 --> 12:48.942
so busy trying
to protect your brother

12:48.942 --> 12:51.031
that you haven't noticed
that he doesn't need it.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.859
So, maybe it's time
for you to recognize

12:52.859 --> 12:54.164
that he's a total badass.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.171
Toodles.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.826
Thanks for
sticking up for me.

13:03.826 --> 13:04.827
It's nice to have
someone believe in me

13:04.827 --> 13:06.786
even if it is you.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.571
Oh, yeah, I just
said that because

13:09.571 --> 13:12.356
there's something I need
you to do for me.

It's a shame we won't

13:54.007 --> 13:57.097
Your mom's been MIA from

13:57.097 --> 13:59.360
Yeah, Dad's taping
"Quiz Bowl" tonight.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.058
Mom's been spending more time
at the studio to support him.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.582
Of course.
Well, they must be
so proud.

14:04.582 --> 14:07.194
Brody told us you're on

14:14.201 --> 14:15.767
Won State 4 years running.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.903
No pressure.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.731
You'll do fine.
I'm certain.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.994
Though I doubt we can
count on your next opponent

14:24.994 --> 14:27.867

Hi there.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.306
Turner,
what are you doing here?

15:16.306 --> 15:18.918
Waiting on a "thank you"
for stopping him
from shooting you?

15:18.918 --> 15:21.311
One, I had him.
Two, now I can't

15:21.311 --> 15:24.140
question him to find out
what they were
planning next.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.185
So, thank you.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.101
How'd you even
find this place?

15:28.101 --> 15:30.146
The rocket that
took down that airship

15:30.146 --> 15:32.670
came from the north, so,
from the point of impact,

15:32.670 --> 15:34.324
it's a straight line
to this area.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.023
There are, like,
50 warehouses in this area.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.633
How did you narrow it down
to this one?

15:40.026 --> 15:42.637
When I was little,
my dad and I
used to play a game.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.465
He called it
"Sore Thumb."

15:44.465 --> 15:46.684
Wherever we were--
dinners, parties--

15:46.684 --> 15:48.034
he would have me
pick out

15:48.034 --> 15:49.861
the thing that
didn't belong.

15:49.861 --> 15:51.124
I always thought
it was just a game

15:51.124 --> 15:52.386
to entertain
a bored kid,

15:52.386 --> 15:53.996
but turns out...

15:53.996 --> 15:55.998
He was teaching you
situational awareness.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.696
Yup. So, when I saw
that this warehouse

15:58.696 --> 16:00.829
was the only one
without security lights

16:00.829 --> 16:03.310
and the gates were
padlocked from the inside,

16:03.310 --> 16:05.703
I suspected somebody was
trying to hide something.

16:07.879 --> 16:11.057
Looks like you put
those skills to good use.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.841
I just can't figure out why
he would teach them to me

16:12.841 --> 16:14.016
if he didn't want me
to use them.

16:15.235 --> 16:16.366
I'm sure he had a reason.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.857
These are from
Ace Chemicals.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.120
So, it wasn't
a terrorist attack.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.904
Crashing that airship
into Ace Chemicals
was to cover the fact

16:32.904 --> 16:34.602
that the Mutants
were robbing the place.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.038
What are they planning to do
with a bunch of chemicals?

16:43.263 --> 16:44.264
They're empty.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.616
Whatever they were planning,
they already did it.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.372
Good to see you, Martin.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.030
Miss Brown.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.120
How are you
this evening?

17:14.120 --> 17:15.382
Ah. Should I
get my lawyer

17:15.382 --> 17:16.644
down here before
I answer that?

17:17.819 --> 17:19.821
Harvey Dent.

17:19.821 --> 17:23.607
Gotham's white knight...
in black tie.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.740
Lincoln. Good to see you.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.264
Have you met
my wife Rebecca?

17:28.264 --> 17:31.180
No, I don't
believe I have.
Pleasure to meet you.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.791
So, if you're here
glad-handing the donor class,

17:33.791 --> 17:35.793
I assume the rumors are true

17:35.793 --> 17:37.143
and you are running for mayor.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.492
Right now,
my focus is on

17:38.492 --> 17:40.624
the current job
I was elected to do.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.148
Is that right?
All right.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.932
Well, if you ever hope to be

17:43.932 --> 17:46.108
a politician in this town,

17:46.108 --> 17:47.805
better learn how to lie
better than that.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.594
I have to disagree
with my husband.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.161
I think you lie
quite well.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.775
I almost believed you when
you told him we'd never met.

18:14.049 --> 18:16.617
Desk sergeant: Sign 'em out,
you gotta sign 'em back in.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.967
It's called chain of custody.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.055
Yeah.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.492
Ahem.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.452
How you doing?

18:27.410 --> 18:29.282
Desk sergeant: What do you want?
Yeah, I'm from
Somerset Precinct.

18:29.282 --> 18:30.979
I just got a case file
transfer request.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.850
Does this look like
the Records Room to you?

18:32.850 --> 18:34.461
Uh, uh--

18:34.461 --> 18:35.853
Down the hall,
third door on the left.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.986
Look for a sign
that says "Records."

18:41.337 --> 18:42.295
Hey.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.517
Do they not teach you
anything over there

18:47.517 --> 18:48.823
at Somerset, rook?

18:51.042 --> 18:55.046
Coffee. You come into another
man's shop asking for stuff,

18:55.046 --> 18:57.005
a little juice of the bean
goes a long way.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.789
Right. I'll--I'll
remember that, sir.
Thank you.

18:58.789 --> 19:01.096
Yeah. I'll remember you.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.760
Uh, what's all this?

19:12.760 --> 19:14.588
We were kind of hoping
you could tell us.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.416
We found these chemicals
and some kind of blueprints

19:16.416 --> 19:18.592
trashed at a Mutant Gang
stash house.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.724
Any idea what they're up to?

19:20.724 --> 19:22.900
Well, you've got nitrobromide

19:22.900 --> 19:24.511
and uridium oxidate.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.382
Not much you can make
out of those.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.080
They're both solubles.
They wouldn't even
cause a reaction

19:29.080 --> 19:32.867
unless they were put under
pressure and aerosolized.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.002
Damn. It looks like
they're making

19:38.002 --> 19:39.700
some kind of
poison gas bomb.

19:39.700 --> 19:41.005
To gas the city?

19:41.005 --> 19:42.529
No. If you
release it outdoors,

19:42.529 --> 19:44.052
it'll dissipate
too quickly.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.575
For it to work, it needs
to stay concentrated,

19:45.575 --> 19:47.011
like in an enclosed area.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.883
The GCPD. No.

19:48.883 --> 19:51.364
Now that the cops
have Vernon in a cage,

19:51.364 --> 19:52.626
I don't think
the Mutant Gang
would risk

19:52.626 --> 19:54.149
killing their leader.

19:54.149 --> 19:55.542
I know what
my daddy would do.

19:59.763 --> 20:00.895
He would make a statement.

20:04.028 --> 20:07.641
All right.
What does poison gas do?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.033
Uh, it kills people?

20:09.033 --> 20:10.948
Well, yes, but how?

20:10.948 --> 20:12.646
It chokes you to death.
Ding ding ding!

20:12.646 --> 20:14.952
Yes. And who better
to choke with it

20:14.952 --> 20:17.041
than the people who've
had Gotham by the throat

20:17.041 --> 20:18.434
since the very beginning?

20:18.434 --> 20:20.567
The ones who are,
as we speak,

20:20.567 --> 20:23.134
congratulating themselves
between bites of

20:23.134 --> 20:24.745
little, overpriced
fish eggs.

20:24.745 --> 20:25.746
The Founders Gala.

20:25.746 --> 20:26.747
Yes! You are on fire

20:26.747 --> 20:27.922
today, Little Bird.

20:27.922 --> 20:29.053
I mean, come on.
All those

20:29.053 --> 20:30.229
well-heeled hypocrites,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.796
just gasping
for rarefied air.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.885
The mayor.
The district attorney.

20:34.885 --> 20:35.973
Stephanie.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.112
Two virgin mojitos.

20:47.898 --> 20:50.466
Really? 'Cause this one
tastes pretty slutty to me.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.164
Yeah, I tipped
the bartender a 20
to pretend I'm 21.

20:53.164 --> 20:54.818
You know, given our
recent brushes with the law,

20:54.818 --> 20:56.255
I'm not sure adding
underage drinking

20:56.255 --> 20:57.952
to our rap sheets
is a good idea.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.693
You're about to have dinner
with my parents.

20:59.693 --> 21:01.782
Trust me, you are
going to need it.

21:05.829 --> 21:06.787
Your mom seems nice.

21:08.615 --> 21:09.790
And my dad?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.097
Your mom seems nice.

21:13.097 --> 21:16.144
Huh. Yeah.
She is.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.803
It's not always easy being
married to Lincoln March,

21:22.803 --> 21:25.153
even though she
makes it seem that way.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.286
Starting to get the sense
it's not easy being his son.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.599
I have to get this. Sorry.

21:36.599 --> 21:37.644
Yeah.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.693
Yes, the party is awful,
the lava cake is garbage,

21:43.693 --> 21:45.347
my feet are killing me,
and I'm having a terrible time.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.480
Steph, listen.
You have to get out of there.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.698
What? Why?

21:48.698 --> 21:49.873
The Mutant Gang's
about to do

21:49.873 --> 21:51.179
something terrible.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.315
Who was that?
Officer 2: Shots fired.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.494
Grenade!

22:18.902 --> 22:21.427
No need to panic.

22:21.427 --> 22:24.343
We're just here to provide
the evening's entertainment.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.520
Do you all like games?

22:27.520 --> 22:30.914
Because I have one
that I think you'll love.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.875
It's a very simple game.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.224
It's called...

22:37.747 --> 22:39.358
"What Does This Button Do?"

22:42.099 --> 22:44.624
Male reporter: It's a chaotic
scene here at City Hall

22:44.624 --> 22:47.322
as the Founders Gala
has been taken hostage

22:47.322 --> 22:50.064
by the Mutant Gang, who have
barricaded themselves inside,

22:50.064 --> 22:53.546
threatening to detonate
a chemical explosive

22:53.546 --> 22:55.896
if the GCPD does not
release their leader,

22:55.896 --> 22:58.551
Vernon Wagner,
by 10 p.m. tonight.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.728
In these dark times,
I'm sure I'm not alone

23:01.728 --> 23:05.340
in feeling that Gotham
could use a Batman.

23:05.340 --> 23:08.604
Woman on TV:
Isn't that the truth?
In other news, Gotham...

23:13.522 --> 23:15.655
So, you guys
are... going in?

23:15.655 --> 23:17.134
We were kind of hoping
you would join us.

23:17.134 --> 23:18.484
Uh, why the hell
would I do that?

23:18.484 --> 23:19.833
You know how
to disable a bomb.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.922
Yeah. Step One:
call the bomb squad.

23:21.922 --> 23:25.142
They don't have
the instruction manual.
We do.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.014
Besides, if they go in
and kick the door down,

23:27.014 --> 23:28.624
then the Mutants will
just set off the bomb.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.844
Sorry, how is what you're
planning any different?

23:30.844 --> 23:33.629
Well, you don't
have to go through
the front door.

23:33.629 --> 23:36.415
Decommissioned subway tunnels
will take you right under it.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.286
Then you could
pop up into City Hall

23:38.286 --> 23:40.375
like a stripper
popping out of a cake.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.769
But you would need
someone to open the door
from the inside.

23:42.769 --> 23:45.467
If I could arrange that,
would you show us the way?

23:45.467 --> 23:47.600
Why would I risk
my life to save
a bunch of people

23:47.600 --> 23:48.992
who don't give
a damn about me?

23:48.992 --> 23:50.516
Same reason we saved you
from the Talon.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.821
You do realize
it's impossible

23:51.821 --> 23:53.214
to guilt me into
anything, right?

23:54.868 --> 23:57.131
Fine. You'll get to punch
a bunch of Mutants.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.438
Oh! Should've led
with that.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.613
I'll get my purse.

24:03.529 --> 24:06.009
All officers,
report to the briefing room.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.493
You.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.364
Briefing. Now.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.192
I really gotta get
these records down
to Somerset, though.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.542
All hands on deck, rook.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.805
Hostage situation
at City Hall.

24:18.805 --> 24:20.241
Briefing room. Now.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.556
Take a seat.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.645
All right now.
All right, everybody.

24:32.645 --> 24:34.473
Listen up.
Settle down.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.996
We got a hostage situation.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.410
Here you thought you wouldn't
make this year's Gala.

24:59.410 --> 25:01.587
Not exactly how I wanted
to join the party.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.023
Everyone, stay on comms.

25:03.023 --> 25:04.459
I'll do a sweep
while you guys

25:04.459 --> 25:06.069
figure out where
they put the bomb.

25:06.069 --> 25:07.157
For maximum dispersal,
they'll have put it

25:07.157 --> 25:08.245
in the HVAC system.

25:08.245 --> 25:09.856
Boiler room's this way.

25:09.856 --> 25:10.944
But there might be
some of those Mutants

25:10.944 --> 25:12.032
between here and there.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.561
Yah!
Uhh!

25:21.737 --> 25:24.131
Hmm.

25:25.915 --> 25:27.569
We gotta get this thing
out of here.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.397
Wait, wait.

25:29.397 --> 25:30.746
See that?

25:30.746 --> 25:32.443
It's a mercury
tilt switch.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.271
Used to use it
in old thermostats.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.056
You move it,
mercury closes the circuit.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.361
Uh, what
does that mean?

25:37.361 --> 25:38.537
It means the Mutants

25:38.537 --> 25:39.625
are smarter than we thought.

25:39.625 --> 25:42.715
You move
this thing--boom.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.151
Then we have to
disable it here.

25:50.461 --> 25:53.203
All right, listen up.
Rings, watches.

25:53.203 --> 25:56.424
Trinkets. All in the bag.

25:56.424 --> 25:59.427
Make a donation, everybody.
Let's go.

25:59.427 --> 26:00.950
Mutant 2: I'll take that. Brody.

26:00.950 --> 26:02.735
Uhh!
Mutant 1: Come on, come on.

26:09.916 --> 26:12.440
Woman on phone: There's
a lot of red tape and I don't
have that kind of authority.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.529
I don't care how much
red tape you've
gotta cut through.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.052
There's gonna be
a lot more red down here

26:16.052 --> 26:17.184
if you don't!

26:17.184 --> 26:19.795
Release him.
On my order.

26:19.795 --> 26:22.798
Huh. You hear that?

26:22.798 --> 26:24.191
So, here's what
you're gonna do.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.285
Do I honestly have to
tell you what will happen

26:31.285 --> 26:33.200
if you give in
to their demands?

26:33.200 --> 26:35.463
Um, we make it
out of this alive?

26:35.463 --> 26:38.945
You will be sending
a message to every criminal

26:38.945 --> 26:41.469
that not only do we
negotiate with terrorists,

26:41.469 --> 26:43.036
but we give them
everything they want.

26:43.036 --> 26:44.994
Hardly. We're trading
one Mutant Leader

26:44.994 --> 26:46.430
for the rest of his gang.

26:46.430 --> 26:47.823
This place is surrounded.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.695
They're not
getting outta here.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.654
And I am sending a message
to the criminals, Harvey.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.134
Don't mess with us.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.013
Careful. Don't want
to get bomb

27:04.013 --> 27:05.319
all over your Valentino.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.625
It's a May Nickel.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.975
And that is
a mutating algorithm

27:08.975 --> 27:10.977
that deletes itself
once complete.

27:10.977 --> 27:13.632
Uh, what happens
when it deletes itself?

27:13.632 --> 27:14.807
It deletes us.

27:17.505 --> 27:18.680
Don't want this one
getting loose

27:18.680 --> 27:20.508
while I go handle his buddies.

27:20.508 --> 27:23.337
Uh, guys?
I just searched
for the frequency

27:23.337 --> 27:24.512
that'll deactivate this thing

27:24.512 --> 27:26.688
and there isn't one.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.516
Just one to activate it.

27:28.516 --> 27:30.213
So, it was meant to turn on
and never turn off.

27:30.213 --> 27:32.172
So, the bomb's going off
no matter what?

27:32.172 --> 27:33.869
That'd kill the Mutants
along with us.

27:35.392 --> 27:36.655
Unless they
planned ahead.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.353
They all brought these.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.356
Maybe they always intended
to gas the place.

27:42.356 --> 27:45.054
Gotta say, it's kind of
the perfect escape plan.

27:45.054 --> 27:47.883
The GCPD releases the Mutant
Leader, they set off the bomb.

27:47.883 --> 27:51.060
The GCPD doesn't release
the Mutant Leader,
they set off the bomb,

27:51.060 --> 27:52.540
and then they all
peace out of here while

27:52.540 --> 27:54.324
seizures and suffocation
get to fight

27:54.324 --> 27:55.935
over what kills us first.

27:55.935 --> 27:57.763
Great. Huh.
Just gonna hang on to this.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.416
How much time do we
have to defuse it?

27:59.416 --> 28:00.504
42 minutes.
And that's if

28:00.504 --> 28:01.680
the GCPD doesn't release

28:01.680 --> 28:02.768
the Mutant Leader before then.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.204
We have to warn them not to.

28:04.204 --> 28:05.727
Buy ourselves as much
time as possible.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.728
Yeah. We're the last ones
they'll believe.

28:08.164 --> 28:12.212
There is one person
the GCPD will believe. Harvey.

28:13.779 --> 28:16.216
I just gotta make him
believe me first.

28:16.216 --> 28:18.261
OK, and if he doesn't,
he'll have you arrested.

28:20.568 --> 28:21.700
You're gonna risk that?

28:23.919 --> 28:25.573
A lot of people
will die if I don't.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.100
Sit down now. Quiet.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.233
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.800
Mutant 2: Calm down.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.976
We've already taken
what we wanted from you.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.064
Have a seat.

28:40.022 --> 28:41.415
Come with me.

28:41.415 --> 28:42.895
Sit down now. Quiet.

28:44.157 --> 28:47.247
Ahh. OK. OK.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.816
If you're gonna kill me,
just get it over with.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.078
I'm not gonna kill you.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.255
Turner.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.434
What the hell
are you doing here?

29:00.434 --> 29:01.696
We don't have much time.

29:03.350 --> 29:05.091
That gas bomb is
in the boiler room,

29:05.091 --> 29:06.440
and as soon as their leader
is released, the Mutant Gang

29:06.440 --> 29:07.571
are gonna set it off.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.138
That's their exit strategy.

29:09.138 --> 29:10.749
Kill everybody here,

29:10.749 --> 29:11.924
escape in the chaos.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.360
You show up here

29:13.360 --> 29:14.753
and you're dressed
like one of them

29:14.753 --> 29:16.102
and now you're
telling me that you know

29:16.102 --> 29:17.930
what they're
planning to do? How?

29:17.930 --> 29:19.583
You need to trust me.

29:19.583 --> 29:20.846
How can I do that?

29:20.846 --> 29:23.283
You're a fugitive
who ran.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.458
Because I was framed.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.939
Then why not
let me help you?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.636
Because you can't.

29:28.636 --> 29:30.203
You asked me before if
I knew what that coin

29:30.203 --> 29:31.813
they found
on my dad meant.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.336
I didn't know then.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.643
But I do now.

29:35.643 --> 29:38.254
It's the symbol of
the Court of Owls.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.343
They're a secret cabal
that's been
pulling strings in Gotham

29:40.343 --> 29:41.954
since the city was founded.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.346
Turner, this is insane.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.480
Listen. The Court
killed my dad.

29:48.438 --> 29:49.657
And now they're
trying to kill me.

29:50.832 --> 29:51.833
And the others.

29:53.052 --> 29:54.488
We can't trust anyone.

29:55.837 --> 29:56.969
Then why trust me?

29:58.579 --> 30:00.015
Because my dad did.

30:06.848 --> 30:08.154
What do you need me to do?

30:12.288 --> 30:13.986
We could try to cut off
the outflow of the aerosol.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.857
Stop it
from releasing the gas.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.424
And if the stainless steel
can't contain the pressure,

30:17.424 --> 30:18.729
then, congratulations,
you've just turned

30:18.729 --> 30:20.166
a chemical bomb
into a regular bomb.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.037
I suppose you have
a better idea?

30:22.037 --> 30:23.778
Yeah. Not doing your idea.

30:23.778 --> 30:25.345
Right, because
Gotham Academy is renowned

30:25.345 --> 30:26.999
for its Honors
Bomb Defusing classes.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.697
Nope, just
basic science.

30:29.697 --> 30:31.438
We're better off
disrupting the power source

30:31.438 --> 30:33.353
to the valve
that pressurizes it.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.790
That's your solution?
Cut the wire?

30:35.790 --> 30:37.705
What's next?
Bang on it with a hammer?

30:37.705 --> 30:39.359
The Mutants could've
built in a hidden redundancy,

30:39.359 --> 30:41.100
in which case
you cut the primary,

30:41.100 --> 30:43.363
this thing hot-boxes
half the city's
power players.

30:43.363 --> 30:45.234
Oh, uh, and us.

30:45.234 --> 30:47.149
Can you read me?

30:47.149 --> 30:49.108
Me and Duela took out
as many Mutants as we could.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.414
All that's left are
the ones in the Gallery.

30:51.414 --> 30:52.851
How are you two
doing down there?

30:55.941 --> 30:57.246
Can I talk to you?

30:57.246 --> 30:58.595
You have
to recall the order

30:58.595 --> 30:59.727
to release
the Mutant Leader.

30:59.727 --> 31:01.120
Why the hell
would I do that?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.730
Because if you don't,
we're all dead.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.123
It's a double-cross.
They're gonna gas this place

31:04.123 --> 31:05.602
the moment
you set him free.

31:05.602 --> 31:07.822
Who told you that?

31:07.822 --> 31:10.564
I'm asking you to please
just trust me on this.

31:10.564 --> 31:12.087
Trust the guy
that wants my job?

31:18.615 --> 31:19.747
Prisoner coming through.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.406
Delta on point.
Transfer team ready.

31:29.539 --> 31:30.801
Let's move him out now.

31:36.851 --> 31:38.418
And things just got worse.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.334
Cullen says they've
released the Mutant Leader.

31:43.466 --> 31:44.772
Carrie, you guys need
to take out the rest of

31:44.772 --> 31:46.817
those Mutants, like, now.

31:46.817 --> 31:49.777
As you requested,
Vernon Wagner has been

31:49.777 --> 31:51.997
released into
the sewer system.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.433
Well ahead of
your deadline.

31:55.609 --> 31:56.827
That's probably him now.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.747
Vernon on phone:
I'm in the subway system.

32:03.747 --> 32:04.923
You are good to go.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.189
Our leader's been released!

32:13.801 --> 32:17.152
Now you will all be free.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.768
Uhh!

32:49.271 --> 32:50.359
Whatever
you're gonna do,

32:50.359 --> 32:52.231
do it now.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.841
We have to shut
that bomb down.

32:55.060 --> 32:56.844
OK, I'm gonna disable
the pressure valve.

32:56.844 --> 32:57.976
Too late.

32:57.976 --> 32:58.977
Wait, no!

33:13.426 --> 33:15.080
Freeze! Police!

33:35.056 --> 33:37.015
What the hell was that?

33:38.625 --> 33:40.192
Excuse me?

33:40.192 --> 33:41.715
You know what
I'm talking about.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.717
You mean the part
where I saved our lives?

33:43.717 --> 33:45.936
No, the part where
you took a chance
with my life.

33:45.936 --> 33:48.374
Which you still have,
thanks to me.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.550
You cut the wire without
knowing what would happen.

33:50.550 --> 33:52.465
Because I knew what
would happen if I didn't.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.206
You do realize the only way
you win this argument

33:54.206 --> 33:55.729
is by being dead, right?

33:55.729 --> 33:57.122
No, because my way
would have worked,

33:57.122 --> 33:58.775
only you didn't give
me a chance because

33:58.775 --> 34:00.386
I didn't go to some
fancy private school,

34:00.386 --> 34:02.083
but that does not make you
smarter than me.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.606
I never said that.

34:03.606 --> 34:05.956
Yeah. You did when
you cut that wire.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.743
This isn't
your daddy's game show.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.484
Now, why don't you go
back to your cozy bedroom

34:11.484 --> 34:13.007
on the top floor
of your mansion.

34:14.443 --> 34:15.923
Easier to look down
on me from there.

34:21.842 --> 34:24.323
Man on TV: While
the hostage situation
has been resolved,

34:24.323 --> 34:27.674
the leader of the Mutant Gang
is once again at large,

34:27.674 --> 34:29.980
but Gotham can rest
a bit easier tonight,

34:29.980 --> 34:33.288
thanks in part to
the heroic efforts--and fists--

34:33.288 --> 34:35.421
of District Attorney
Harvey Dent.

34:38.641 --> 34:41.427
Mr. Dent, we didn't find
any explosive devices
on the premises.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.777
What? He had a detonator.

34:43.777 --> 34:47.128
We swept
the facility, including
the ventilator ducts.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.696
Nothing.
Maybe the Mutants
were bluffing

34:49.696 --> 34:50.784
to get their
leader out.

34:52.133 --> 34:53.091
Damn it.

34:54.657 --> 34:56.877
So, we save everyone's lives

34:56.877 --> 34:58.792
and Harvey Dent
gets all the credit?

35:00.010 --> 35:01.795
Look, he can have
the credit as long as

35:01.795 --> 35:03.188
we can have
the shiny stuff.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.106
And what
the Mutants take...

35:09.542 --> 35:11.109
we taketh away.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.505
I know what
you're gonna say.
"This is so wrong.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.507
The gala guests
were victims, too."

35:25.166 --> 35:26.385
Not all of them.

35:30.345 --> 35:31.651
It's a Court of Owls watch.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.000
Just like
the one Ford had.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.310
So is this one.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.140
The Court of Owls
were at the gala

35:42.140 --> 35:43.532
and we didn't even
know it.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.186
There were
over 200 people there.

35:45.186 --> 35:47.188
Which means we have no way
of knowing who they are.

35:47.188 --> 35:49.321
Well, maybe this
will help us find them.

35:49.321 --> 35:51.018
As promised.
Every scrap of paper

35:51.018 --> 35:52.759
the GCPD has on
Alan Wayne's death.

35:52.759 --> 35:55.240
Autopsy reports, eyewitness
statements, all of it.

35:55.240 --> 35:56.893
If the Court did kill him,
hopefully there's

35:56.893 --> 35:58.504
something in here
that'll lead us to them.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.210
Uhh!

36:11.647 --> 36:13.649
Think I'll do your
sparring partner a favor

36:13.649 --> 36:15.085
and call a TKO.

36:17.566 --> 36:18.524
They let him go.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.223
After everything
the Mutant Leader has done,

36:22.223 --> 36:23.398
and all the people
he's hurt.

36:25.444 --> 36:26.445
And they let him go.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.231
I know.
It's insane.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.276
It's Gotham.

36:33.930 --> 36:38.065
You try to change it
and it just changes you.

36:41.155 --> 36:42.722
Makes me wonder
why I even do it.

36:43.984 --> 36:45.203
Because you're
really good at it.

36:51.948 --> 36:55.082
Not easy to say it,
but I gotta admit:

36:57.302 --> 36:58.477
I'm jealous of you.

37:00.522 --> 37:02.394
I see why my dad
wanted you as his Robin.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.400
I just wish I'd gotten
to see that side of him.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.490
Turner... you got
to see the side of him

37:11.490 --> 37:13.448
that I never did.

37:13.448 --> 37:17.104
The man who takes his kid
on camping trips.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.239
Dad.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.853
I was so young
when my dad died.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.772
I never got to experience
that kind of stuff.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.779
So, I'm jealous of you.

37:41.694 --> 37:43.435
Well, it's clear
from his journals

37:43.435 --> 37:44.784
how much he cared
about you.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.832
It's also clear just
how responsible he felt

37:49.832 --> 37:51.617
for every bad thing
that every bad guy

37:51.617 --> 37:53.488
did in Gotham
that he didn't stop.

37:55.142 --> 37:57.362
It was eating him
up inside.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.146
And I can't imagine
he'd want that for you.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.976
My dad didn't want me
going down his path.

38:04.238 --> 38:05.892
And I may never
know why.

38:08.068 --> 38:11.811
But I do know...
following in his footsteps

38:11.811 --> 38:13.813
makes me feel
closer to him.

38:15.597 --> 38:17.686
He wouldn't want you
to bear the weight
of his legacy alone.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.472
Let me help you.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.260
Risking your freedom
to save all those people?

38:27.522 --> 38:30.046
It was very brave.
And, Turner,

38:30.046 --> 38:32.048
your dad would be
so proud of you.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.748
Is that a yes?
Come on.

38:35.748 --> 38:38.881
What did you say that night
you followed my dad?

38:38.881 --> 38:40.927
What convinced him
to let you help him?

38:40.927 --> 38:43.233
I didn't convince him.
Not that time.

38:44.409 --> 38:46.541
He said no.
And then
I followed him again

38:46.541 --> 38:48.717
and then I asked him again
and he said no.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.197
Actually, I got
a lot of nos.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.113
But I just
kept on asking.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.074
I guess I never gave up.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.688
Kinda sucks to be
the Mutant Leader then.

39:02.688 --> 39:04.124
With that
kind of persistence...

39:06.039 --> 39:07.388
he won't be free for long.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.408
Was not easy,
but I got it.

39:27.408 --> 39:29.889
Not sure why you wanted that
from evidence lockup.

39:29.889 --> 39:31.238
I thought you hated him.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.327
Oh, I do.

39:33.327 --> 39:35.285
This is just so I
don't forget how much.

39:40.421 --> 39:41.814
Cullen?

39:41.814 --> 39:43.511
No, I don't want
to hear it.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.426
You walked into a building
with a bomb in it.

39:45.426 --> 39:47.123
You're the last person
who gets to lecture me

39:47.123 --> 39:49.082
about doing
something dangerous.
I can handle myself.

39:49.082 --> 39:51.432
I know that.
Really?

39:51.432 --> 39:53.478
'Cause you've been
treating me like some
weak, scared, little kid.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.567
Cullen.

not against anybody.

40:04.663 --> 40:08.797

40:24.378 --> 40:26.815
I've been a citizen
of Gotham my whole life.

40:26.815 --> 40:30.515
I grew up in Cobble Hill,
just across the river.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.342
Ha ha!
That's right.

40:35.171 --> 40:41.177
For as long as I can remember,
unchecked crime and corruption

40:41.177 --> 40:45.399
have cast a dark shadow
over this city.

40:45.399 --> 40:49.055
And I think it's time
we remind those criminals

40:49.055 --> 40:52.058
that we are not helpless.

40:52.058 --> 40:56.715
We will no longer live
in the grip of fear.

40:56.715 --> 40:59.631
That we will fight
for a better Gotham,

40:59.631 --> 41:03.852
fight for a brighter tomorrow.

41:08.770 --> 41:10.642
Get us the hell out of here!

41:14.080 --> 41:18.171
And we will let a new dawn
of hope shine down

41:18.171 --> 41:21.000
on the streets of
this great city.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.654
That is what I want.

41:22.654 --> 41:25.483
No! No!

41:25.483 --> 41:29.138
No! Oh, no! No!

41:30.879 --> 41:34.535
And that is why
I am running

41:34.535 --> 41:36.537
for mayor of Gotham.

42:04.957 --> 42:06.524
Greg, move your head.
