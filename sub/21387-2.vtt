WEBVTT

00:03.092 --> 00:03.800
-You live near here?
-Yup!

00:04.050 --> 00:05.383
-Are you originally from here?
-Yeah.

00:05.383 --> 00:06.259
How are you still single?

00:06.717 --> 00:07.425
Check!

00:07.675 --> 00:09.717
I'm just...
tired of this dating shit.

00:09.717 --> 00:11.259
And I compare every dude
to Lawrence.

00:11.259 --> 00:12.800
You got your new shit down
to a science.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.591
Roll in on Fridays,
smash all weekend...

00:14.591 --> 00:16.092
We're both having fun.
No pressure.

00:16.466 --> 00:17.800
Pressure busts pipes.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.134
How do you feel about
a plus one party?

00:20.134 --> 00:21.466
MOLLY CARTER:
Guys always want you back when

00:21.466 --> 00:23.259
they know you're doing good
without them.

00:23.466 --> 00:24.425
My life!

00:24.425 --> 00:25.925
I'm one of the best lawyers
they have.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.717
But, I can't just roll up to
the partners and be like,

00:27.717 --> 00:31.050
"So, I accidentally noticed that
you're paying this white man
more than me."

00:31.425 --> 00:32.550
Lawrence isn't coming.

00:32.550 --> 00:33.842
I thought you said you didn't
want him back?

00:33.842 --> 00:35.259
ISSA DEE:
Of course I want my man back.

00:35.259 --> 00:36.175
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

00:36.175 --> 00:37.758
You said you had some
of my mail?

00:48.134 --> 00:49.758
Y'all fucked?

00:49.758 --> 00:51.883
Damn, why your voice got
so much bass in it?

00:51.883 --> 00:54.259
- So, who initiated the sex?
- Him, basically.

00:54.259 --> 00:56.425
- Have y'all spoken since?
- Yeah.

00:56.425 --> 00:59.300
- No. It's unclear.
- Bitch, are you
a Magic 8 Ball?

00:59.300 --> 01:01.092
- What that mean?
- I texted him twice,

01:01.092 --> 01:04.009
and once he responded "sure"
with no punctuation,

01:04.009 --> 01:05.591
and the other time,
two hours later,

01:05.591 --> 01:08.175
he responded "yep"
with a period.

01:08.175 --> 01:10.675
( sucks tongue )
Issa, that's not
even a question.

01:10.675 --> 01:12.717
- It's not even
open-ended.
- Stop!

01:12.717 --> 01:14.175
And then you sent this one
during rush hour?

01:14.175 --> 01:16.009
Man, you know Lawrence
is a safe driver.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.341
Maybe he hasn't
gotten back to me yet

01:18.341 --> 01:20.425
because he's trying
to organize his feelings.

01:20.425 --> 01:21.675
Right?
Do guys do that?

01:21.675 --> 01:22.758
Nigga, I don't know.

01:24.842 --> 01:26.967
Issa,
put the cookie down.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.009
( thuds )

01:28.009 --> 01:31.009
( sighs )
Okay.

01:31.009 --> 01:33.259
How you feeling?

01:33.259 --> 01:34.800
Malibu.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.009
Malibu?
I'm fucking confused.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.675
Like, how I'm supposed
to know what that meant?

01:38.675 --> 01:41.259
- How?
- ( sighs )
Okay, okay.

01:41.259 --> 01:42.591
What kind of fuck
was it?

01:42.591 --> 01:44.717
I mean, was it like
a "we back together" fuck

01:44.717 --> 01:46.050
or a "fuck you" fuck?

01:46.050 --> 01:48.341
I don't know.

01:48.341 --> 01:50.758
It was a nebulous fuck.

01:52.967 --> 01:56.134
A'ight, well,
maybe Lawrence just needs
some more time.

01:56.134 --> 01:57.591
I hope so.

01:59.050 --> 02:00.217
( stutters )
But it's gotta mean

02:00.217 --> 02:02.425
something good,
though, right?

02:02.425 --> 02:05.134
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

02:06.675 --> 02:08.550
Wait a minute.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.175
Did you and Lawrence
fuck on this couch?

02:11.466 --> 02:12.842
This--

02:46.466 --> 02:48.508
I have way more
billable hours
than Travis.

02:48.508 --> 02:50.758
I'm on the partner track.
I'm always working late.

02:50.758 --> 02:52.508
I'm always
on all the firm's
volunteer shit.

02:52.508 --> 02:54.758
Like, I built
some family a house.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.050
I thought
I was killing it.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.633
I just--
( sighs )

02:58.633 --> 03:00.758
Keep going.

03:00.758 --> 03:02.300
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

03:02.300 --> 03:04.508
I get it--
it's an all-boys club,

03:04.508 --> 03:06.967
and whatever
I got to do to get in,

03:06.967 --> 03:08.550
I'll just figure it out.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.009
And then
it should be fine.

03:10.009 --> 03:13.092
You say that a lot--
"should."

03:13.092 --> 03:15.009
You frame a lot of things
in your life with "should."

03:15.009 --> 03:17.050
- Have you noticed that?
- No.

03:17.050 --> 03:19.175
Two weeks ago,
you said,

03:19.175 --> 03:21.092
"Things should be
easier for me

03:21.092 --> 03:22.883
as a successful
black woman."

03:22.883 --> 03:24.259
And another time
you said,

03:24.259 --> 03:27.300
"Things should've fallen
into place by now."

03:27.300 --> 03:30.717
Is there a certain way
you think your life
should go?

03:30.717 --> 03:33.925
Oh, well,
I mean, I do have
specific life goals,

03:33.925 --> 03:37.675
and I think that
if you work hard,
then it sh-- ought

03:37.675 --> 03:39.675
to yield certain results.

03:39.675 --> 03:43.425
There's a medical term
called "magical thinking."

03:43.425 --> 03:45.009
When we believe
what we want

03:45.009 --> 03:46.842
can influence
the external world

03:46.842 --> 03:50.383
as opposed
to accepting things
as they are.

03:50.383 --> 03:51.842
I'm confused.
( chuckles )

03:51.842 --> 03:54.341
I don't see how me trying
to break through at work

03:54.341 --> 03:56.217
connects to any
of these things.

03:56.217 --> 03:57.967
Listen, Molly,
I know as black women

03:57.967 --> 04:00.383
it can feel like
there's a lot of things
stacked against us.

04:00.383 --> 04:01.967
We feel invisible
at work,

04:01.967 --> 04:03.800
we feel the need to have
the perfect relationship.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.383
It's a lot.

04:05.383 --> 04:07.217
But if your shoulds
didn't come to fruition,

04:07.217 --> 04:09.466
would you be open
to your life

04:09.466 --> 04:11.134
looking a different way?

04:14.717 --> 04:17.383
It's just something
for you to think about.

04:17.383 --> 04:21.383
- Yeah.
- So, the same time
next week?

04:21.383 --> 04:24.259
Um, I'll call you.

04:24.259 --> 04:26.383
( music playing )

04:28.717 --> 04:31.717
( woman vocalizing )

04:31.717 --> 04:34.508
Kelli:
Girl, your party
was so much fun!

04:34.508 --> 04:37.383
I haven't been Saturday drunk
on a Thursday in, like, a week.

04:37.383 --> 04:39.050
Yeah, it was
basically perfect,

04:39.050 --> 04:41.383
except for the part
where half my place
burned down.

04:41.383 --> 04:44.009
Well, can't nobody say
your party wasn't lit.

04:44.009 --> 04:46.259
( laughing )
'Cause of the fire.

04:47.550 --> 04:48.925
Thank you guys
so much for coming

04:48.925 --> 04:50.883
and making me look good
in front of my new client.

04:50.883 --> 04:52.466
- Girl, we got you.
- ( all agreeing )

04:52.466 --> 04:54.800
- Let's take a photo.
- You got it.

04:56.217 --> 04:57.883
- ( clicks )
- Now let's do a fun one.

04:57.883 --> 04:59.425
- No.
- Nah, we're good.

04:59.425 --> 05:01.675
( music playing )

05:04.300 --> 05:06.466
Kelli:
We should go bar-hopping
this weekend.

05:06.466 --> 05:09.425
You know that shady,
scary, rundown building
by my SoulCycle?

05:09.425 --> 05:11.050
You know
that's a speakeasy?

05:11.050 --> 05:13.633
- Issa, you in?
- Nah, bars are loud.

05:13.633 --> 05:16.092
I'm all, "Huh? What?"
I can't.

05:16.092 --> 05:18.842
What? Girl, that never
stopped you before.

05:18.842 --> 05:22.717
Yeah, I'm just
not trying to go out
like that presently.

05:22.717 --> 05:23.883
Why not?

05:27.092 --> 05:28.425
Lawrence came by

05:28.425 --> 05:30.591
and we had
a great conversation.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.633
Oh, y'all talked?
What y'all talk about?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.675
Deets.

05:35.675 --> 05:37.425
Uh, it was nice,
you know?

05:37.425 --> 05:40.717
And I know we're not
gonna, like, get back
together right away

05:40.717 --> 05:45.300
or anything, but,
you know, I'm just--
I'm waiting it out.

05:45.300 --> 05:46.925
That is great.

05:46.925 --> 05:48.967
Plus, all couples
go through stuff.

05:48.967 --> 05:51.341
True.
I ain't got nobody
and even I know that.

05:51.341 --> 05:52.800
And, like,
it's no big deal.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.466
Derek lived
in a hotel for half
of last-- whatever.

05:55.466 --> 05:57.633
I found out that he--
it doesn't matter.

05:57.633 --> 05:59.800
The point is
even perfect couples
have problems,

05:59.800 --> 06:01.466
and Derek and I
are great now.

06:01.466 --> 06:03.466
- Oh, shit, what happened?
- We're great now.

06:03.466 --> 06:04.842
It just takes time.

06:04.842 --> 06:07.550
It's hard for men
to come back from...

06:07.550 --> 06:08.842
Cheating.

06:08.842 --> 06:10.967
Yeah, I-- I betrayed
his trust

06:10.967 --> 06:12.591
and I have
to give him space

06:12.591 --> 06:13.550
to forgive me.

06:15.466 --> 06:17.925
But, y'all, we were
in a relationship
for five years.

06:17.925 --> 06:19.466
That doesn't
just go away.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.883
Don't forget
that he was on your couch

06:20.883 --> 06:22.217
for two of those years
needing time

06:22.217 --> 06:23.508
for his "business plan."

06:23.508 --> 06:25.300
Fuck him, move on.

06:26.758 --> 06:28.425
I just don't want
to do anything

06:28.425 --> 06:31.633
if there's a chance
we could work it out.

06:31.633 --> 06:35.050
Does that mean
he broke up with
that girl?

06:35.050 --> 06:38.175
- What-- what girl?
- That girl he was with
after y'all...

06:38.175 --> 06:40.092
Did he not...?

06:40.092 --> 06:41.425
Did that not come up?

06:41.425 --> 06:42.883
Wait, what are you
talking about?

06:42.883 --> 06:45.633
- Tiffany told me.
- ( scoffs )

06:45.633 --> 06:46.842
Derek told me.

06:46.842 --> 06:48.550
I just-- I thought
she was a rebound.

06:48.550 --> 06:49.842
Both of y'all
had moved on.

06:49.842 --> 06:52.050
- I think I just assumed--
- Who is he seeing?

06:52.050 --> 06:54.259
( sighs )
I think her name
is Tasha.

06:54.259 --> 06:57.175
- Tasha.
- I don't want to know
anything else.

06:57.175 --> 06:59.009
You know what, nowadays,
all you need is a name

06:59.009 --> 07:01.758
- and then you're like,
"Bah, bah, bah"--
- Found her. Mm.

07:01.758 --> 07:04.217
- Oh, shit.
- ( both chuckling )

07:04.217 --> 07:06.466
Okay, that lace front
is doing the most.

07:06.466 --> 07:08.092
And why does
she only speak in emojis?

07:08.092 --> 07:10.383
She looks
like she's working
at the Pyramid tonight.

07:10.383 --> 07:11.550
- Mm.
- ( laughs )

07:11.550 --> 07:12.800
Kelli:
Come on.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.175
Guys, it's not
about her, okay?

07:15.175 --> 07:18.092
It's petty to judge her,
and I don't want to be petty.

07:19.425 --> 07:21.591
Mm! You know
what that is?

07:21.591 --> 07:23.550
It's growth.

07:23.550 --> 07:26.050
- Mm-hmm.
- You a big girl.

07:26.050 --> 07:28.259
Got them
big-girl panties.

08:17.300 --> 08:19.009
- I'm fine.

You do something new
with your hair?

08:21.425 --> 08:24.675
Uh, I did, actually.
I used a new conditioner.

08:24.675 --> 08:25.842
Mm.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.134
Yeah, the neighborhood's
coming up.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.675
They just put in
a new juice spot
up the street.

08:31.675 --> 08:33.466
Ne-Yo owns it.
I've seen him a few times.

08:33.466 --> 08:35.508
We both get beet juice.

08:35.508 --> 08:38.466
- Mm.
- You still working
with kids?

08:38.466 --> 08:40.300
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, I do.
- Keep it up.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.175
Once they repeal that
Obamacare, the kids
will need you.

08:42.175 --> 08:44.758
- That's not really what I do.
- It's in the purview.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.425
Uh, is Lawrence around?

08:49.425 --> 08:51.383
Lawrence?

08:51.383 --> 08:53.883
No. No, he's out.

08:55.883 --> 08:59.758
- Okay, uh...
- You, uh, want me
to tell him you came by?

09:02.300 --> 09:04.842
No, that's--
I'll him myself.

09:04.842 --> 09:06.675
- Bye.
- Ah.

09:06.675 --> 09:09.300
Was that Mane 'n Tail
you was using on your
hair, baby?

09:09.300 --> 09:11.591
That's how you got
that growth.

09:11.591 --> 09:12.883
I see them edges.

09:14.050 --> 09:16.758
Ninny,
is your soup hot?

09:16.758 --> 09:19.217
It ain't never
been hotter, sir.

09:19.217 --> 09:20.217
Ooh.

09:20.217 --> 09:21.842
Not now.
Later.

09:21.842 --> 09:24.508
Follow the North Star
to our spot by the creek.

09:24.508 --> 09:26.883
- Uh-uh!
- I's will.

09:32.092 --> 09:34.300
Damn, that little boy
see everything.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.758
He can't leave the house.
He got typhoid.

09:36.758 --> 09:38.508
( chuckles )

09:39.842 --> 09:42.883
- You all right?
- Uh, yeah.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.925
Yeah,
I just, uh...

09:44.925 --> 09:46.842
I got some stuff
on my mind.

09:46.842 --> 09:48.842
Mm-hmm.
You wanna talk
about it?

09:48.842 --> 09:51.883
- ( phone buzzes )
- Oh.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.508
Ugh!
It's my mama.

09:54.508 --> 09:56.300
My family having
this barbecue

09:56.300 --> 09:59.967
and, like always,
I gotta keep Mama from
taking on too damn much.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.633
- ( chuckles )
- Like, just go get
the pies from the store.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.800
Don't nobody care
if you make the crust.

10:07.050 --> 10:09.633
You know,
I was actually
gonna invite you.

10:12.092 --> 10:14.466
Oh.

10:14.466 --> 10:16.717
- Um--
- No, no, no, no.
Okay, it's no pressure.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.883
( laughs )
I was just saying

10:18.883 --> 10:20.508
if you were free
next Saturday,

10:20.508 --> 10:21.717
you may wanted to roll.

10:21.717 --> 10:23.758
Tasha, I slept
with my ex.

10:25.717 --> 10:27.300
What?

10:27.300 --> 10:29.134
( sighs )

10:30.967 --> 10:33.050
( clears throat )
Um...

10:33.050 --> 10:35.842
Yeah, I went over there,
you know, to just
grab my stuff

10:35.842 --> 10:37.633
and it just...

10:39.050 --> 10:41.050
happened.

10:41.050 --> 10:42.967
It wasn't planned.

10:44.925 --> 10:47.925
I just-- I want
to be honest with you.

10:47.925 --> 10:49.800
I'm sorry.

10:52.341 --> 10:56.883
- So, does that mean
that you still like--
- I don't--

10:56.883 --> 10:58.883
( sighs )
I don't know.

10:58.883 --> 11:00.466
I don't--
I don't know.

11:00.466 --> 11:03.425
( scoffs )
"I don't"...

11:06.425 --> 11:08.217
I think you need to go.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.341
What you need, girl?

12:23.341 --> 12:25.842
Oh, well,
I heard Richard and some
of the other attorneys

12:25.842 --> 12:27.425
talking about
a Kings game tomorrow.

12:27.425 --> 12:28.591
Mm-hmm.

12:28.591 --> 12:30.717
- Is Merrill going?
- Yeah, he is.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.383
Why?
You a hockey fan?

12:32.383 --> 12:33.717
( chuckles )
I will be.

12:33.717 --> 12:35.633
- Mm-hmm.
- Ooh.

12:35.633 --> 12:37.883
- Scared of you.
- ( keyboard clicking )

12:40.550 --> 12:42.300
( phone ringing )

12:42.300 --> 12:45.550
( distant chatter )

12:45.550 --> 12:47.717
- Vice Principal Gaines?
- Gaines: Mm-hmm?

12:47.717 --> 12:49.050
They said this was
a good time.

12:49.050 --> 12:51.883
Mm-hmm.
Here, come on.
Right there.

12:51.883 --> 12:54.842
( static and chatter
on radio )

12:54.842 --> 12:58.300
We just want to discuss
student involvement
at We Got Y'all.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.259
- Mm-hmm.
- The turnout hasn't been
as high as we hoped.

13:01.259 --> 13:02.717
We hoped
for at least one.

13:02.717 --> 13:06.175
And we want We Got Y'all
to stay partnered

13:06.175 --> 13:08.758
with this school
for years to come.

13:08.758 --> 13:10.842
Yeah, I-- I think
we all would want--

13:10.842 --> 13:12.675
Man on radio:
Stepped in vomit.

13:12.675 --> 13:15.383
Just throw some sawdust
on it, Larry! Dang!

13:16.883 --> 13:18.842
I think we all
would want that.

13:18.842 --> 13:21.425
Great, then we need
your support.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.967
If we can't get
the students invested

13:23.967 --> 13:25.591
after everything
we've done on our own,

13:25.591 --> 13:27.925
then we'll have
to move on.

13:27.925 --> 13:30.300
And I really don't
want that to happen.

13:31.508 --> 13:33.758
We had two ASPs
depart already

13:33.758 --> 13:37.259
and the music program
has lost funding.

13:37.259 --> 13:40.175
What teacher did we have
you paired with again?

13:40.175 --> 13:43.758
- Ms. Alvarez.
- Mm. Alvarez.

13:43.758 --> 13:46.259
Well, okay.
Don't worry.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.134
I'll jump into it.
We'll get this fixed.

13:48.134 --> 13:50.341
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

13:50.341 --> 13:52.758
Things kind of fall
through the cracks now,
you know,

13:52.758 --> 13:55.550
now that the school's
so overpopulated.

13:55.550 --> 13:57.425
Might have
to build a wall
or something.

13:57.425 --> 14:00.883
Have them pay for it.
( laughs )

14:00.883 --> 14:04.800
- A wall.
- Man #2 on radio: Gaines?
Anybody got Gaines?

14:04.800 --> 14:06.425
- Go Gaines.
- We got mold.

14:06.425 --> 14:09.300
Mold? Well, can't you
just scrape it off?

14:09.300 --> 14:11.134
- ( static hisses )
- Oh, damn!

14:16.217 --> 14:19.134
- Frieda: Did he
just say build a--?
- Mm-hmm.

14:19.134 --> 14:21.009
- And then he laughed?
- Mm-hmm.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.134
- Bruh. Bruh!
- ( sighs ) I know.

14:25.134 --> 14:27.550
Why the fuck
would you tell new girl
you fucked the old girl?

14:27.550 --> 14:29.800
- I couldn't sit on that.
- You should've sat, squatted,
hatched an egg on that shit.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.383
I'm not dirty like that.
( sighs )

14:32.383 --> 14:34.466
I can't even believe
I went over to Issa's
and did that shit.

14:34.466 --> 14:35.967
Like,
I'm so fucking stupid.

14:35.967 --> 14:39.217
I was just about to leave
and then-- fuck!

14:39.217 --> 14:42.134
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

14:42.134 --> 14:44.092
I mean, just when I thought
you was starting to pimp,

14:44.092 --> 14:46.050
you went right back to being
an old John-Legend-ass nigga.

14:46.050 --> 14:48.175
Look at these handrails.
They're too wobbly.
I don't like that.

14:48.175 --> 14:51.466
You can do better
and you should've
done better.

14:51.466 --> 14:54.300
Now I know why
old girl came around
looking for your ass.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.717
Eh...

14:56.717 --> 14:57.967
she always look
like that?

14:59.341 --> 15:01.633
Eboni, hey, girl.
How you doing?

15:01.633 --> 15:03.967
- Hey, you!
- This is my boy, Lawrence.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.633
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

15:05.633 --> 15:08.175
Hey, girl,
give me a hug. Mm.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.217
Mm, that smile.

15:10.217 --> 15:12.675
- You better
be careful with that.
- ( giggles ) Boy, stop.

15:12.675 --> 15:14.050
I'll stop when you stop.

15:14.050 --> 15:15.883
Let me just grab you
the takeaway.

15:15.883 --> 15:18.341
- ( mumbles )
Y'all used to...
- Mm-hmm.

15:18.341 --> 15:20.300
Now, the apartment
has two bedrooms,

15:20.300 --> 15:22.175
one bath,
gas kitchen,

15:22.175 --> 15:24.466
full range,
and a little balcony
over there.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.633
You hear that,
Brian McKnight?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.009
Two bedrooms,
one for you to sleep in

15:27.009 --> 15:29.050
and one
for your feelings.

15:29.050 --> 15:31.425
Y'all want the tour
or you wanna just wander?

15:31.425 --> 15:33.466
No, we'll wander.
Thank you.

15:37.675 --> 15:40.675
You say yes
to the tour, brother.
That's just polite.

15:40.675 --> 15:42.758
- I mean,
this place is big.
- Uh-huh.

15:42.758 --> 15:46.508
- I like the view.
- You got mad recess
lighting, too.

15:46.508 --> 15:47.717
And a dimmer?

15:47.717 --> 15:50.633
Nice.
It's good.

15:53.925 --> 15:56.675
Yeah,
it's a cool spot.

15:57.717 --> 15:59.842
- I just...
- You just what?

16:02.550 --> 16:05.967
- I don't know.
- A lot of people are interested
in this neighborhood,

16:05.967 --> 16:07.675
so this unit's
gonna go quick.

16:17.591 --> 16:20.009
( bell rings )

16:20.009 --> 16:22.425
So, I was thinking
about ways we can get
the kids to stay.

16:22.425 --> 16:25.092
And what do you think
about just telling them
Keke Palmer's coming

16:25.092 --> 16:26.633
and dealing
with the fallout later?

16:27.758 --> 16:29.800
Sorry,
I'm out of it.

16:29.800 --> 16:32.259
I was up all last night
thinking about yesterday.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.383
Yesterday...

16:34.383 --> 16:38.175
That racist joke
Gaines made about the...

16:38.175 --> 16:40.050
Ugh, please don't
make me repeat it.

16:40.050 --> 16:41.717
Ah, right, yeah.
That.

16:41.717 --> 16:43.591
( chuckles )
That was messed up.

16:43.591 --> 16:45.134
I just didn't know
what to do,

16:45.134 --> 16:48.758
so I stressed watched
the documentary "13th."

16:48.758 --> 16:51.134
Then I contacted Ava
on Twitter.

16:51.134 --> 16:52.675
She liked it.

16:54.341 --> 16:56.675
- DuVernay.
- Mm-hmm.

16:56.675 --> 16:59.508
- ( chatter )
- I don't even know
what to tell you.

17:02.508 --> 17:05.300
- Are they lost?
- It feels like another trap.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.508
- Hi!
- Hi.

17:06.508 --> 17:08.967
I'm Ms. Andrews,
your new faculty advisor.

17:08.967 --> 17:11.758
Vice Principal Gaines
told me to help you in
any way that I can.

17:11.758 --> 17:13.633
What do you need?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.466
We could use
some paper.

17:15.466 --> 17:17.134
Do you guys
have paper?

17:17.134 --> 17:19.259
Yes. We're a school.

17:19.259 --> 17:21.466
( chuckles )
Right. No.

17:21.466 --> 17:25.050
Everyone,
Ms. Issa and Ms. Frieda
are our guests,

17:25.050 --> 17:28.466
so let's give them
our undivided attention.

17:28.466 --> 17:31.009
Thank you.
Hey, guys, welcome
to We Got Y'all.

17:31.009 --> 17:32.300
Thank you so much
for coming.

I don't know, I'm kind of
with Molly on this.

18:38.009 --> 18:40.050
- Thank you.
- "Black Mirror"
is so exaggerated.

18:40.050 --> 18:42.967
- It's not even
close to being real.
- Oh, no, it's real, okay?

18:42.967 --> 18:46.341
I covered up all the cameras
on my devices with tape, so.

18:46.341 --> 18:48.591
- ( laughs )
- There you go.

18:50.092 --> 18:53.175
Come on.
Let's go, Kings!

18:53.175 --> 18:54.800
Announcer:
One minute,
one minute remaining

18:54.800 --> 18:57.259

18:57.259 --> 18:59.341
( announcer continues
indistinctly )

19:01.925 --> 19:04.633
- Lobster rolls.
Oh, those are so good.
- Oh, yeah, they are.

19:04.633 --> 19:07.300
You know, last game,
I brought two home
in my pocket.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.425
Needless to say,
the wife was not
too pleased.

19:09.425 --> 19:10.800
Oh, well,
then your wife

19:10.800 --> 19:12.883
should definitely
not look in my purse
right now.

19:12.883 --> 19:14.050
( both laughing )

19:15.925 --> 19:18.217
Oh, man, did he just slam
that dude into a wall?

19:18.217 --> 19:20.341
Yeah, that's Kyle Clifford.
He's an enforcer.

19:20.341 --> 19:22.925
So, he just gets paid
to skate around and
be a badass?

19:22.925 --> 19:25.800
- Yeah, pretty much.
- ( chuckles ) Is hockey
my new favorite sport?

19:25.800 --> 19:26.758
Is it?

19:26.758 --> 19:28.633
Could be.
( laughs )

19:30.259 --> 19:32.925
( chatter )

19:32.925 --> 19:34.050
See you tomorrow.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.550
- See you tomorrow.
- Holy shit.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.009
- ( quietly ) I mean,
holy shit.
- Right?

19:39.009 --> 19:40.383
- Gaines: Hey, Robert?
- Robert: Yeah?

19:40.383 --> 19:41.925
We speak English
here at school.

19:41.925 --> 19:44.092
You save that Spanish
for the bus.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.341
Okay, we at least
have to put that

19:47.341 --> 19:49.717
in our notes
for Joanne.

19:49.717 --> 19:52.300
So she can see that
and not all the good stuff?

19:52.300 --> 19:54.466
I mean,
the kids have come
two times in a row.

19:54.466 --> 19:56.217
We're already
making progress.

19:56.217 --> 19:59.300
Yeah, that's great,
but we're just
gonna go along

19:59.300 --> 20:00.717
with his kind of thinking?

20:00.717 --> 20:02.175
( stutters )
Who cares what he thinks?

20:02.175 --> 20:03.842
We're the ones who have
the kids after school,

20:03.842 --> 20:05.508
and we don't think
like that, so.

20:06.925 --> 20:08.967
Okay.

20:08.967 --> 20:12.050
I know that the oppressed
cannot be the oppressor,
obviously--

20:12.050 --> 20:14.466
obviously, but...

20:16.550 --> 20:18.591
would it still be okay
if he said those things

20:18.591 --> 20:20.300
if he was, you know...

20:21.925 --> 20:24.175
white?

20:24.175 --> 20:25.842
I mean, we're not
gonna change him.

20:25.842 --> 20:27.967
It's, like,
he is who he is.

20:32.259 --> 20:34.883
So, are you saying
that makes it okay?

20:34.883 --> 20:38.300
I'm saying that I'm the one
that's on the hook for this

20:38.300 --> 20:41.508
and I'm gonna do
what I have to do
to make this work.

20:45.134 --> 20:46.675
Gaines:
That's right.

20:46.675 --> 20:48.800
( laughs )
Good luck, man.

20:50.425 --> 20:51.842
Mm, hi.

20:54.967 --> 20:57.175
Thank you so much again
for everything.

20:57.175 --> 20:58.508
You've been so helpful.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.550
Oh, yeah, sure.
You know, whatever you need.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.550
And I'm glad Mrs. Andrews
is working out for you.

21:02.550 --> 21:05.217
- Oh, she's great.
- You know we gotta
stick together.

21:05.217 --> 21:08.217
You know, Mexicans
stick together.
And Jews.

21:08.217 --> 21:10.383
Latinos starting
to take over around here.

21:10.383 --> 21:12.425
I remember
when this school
was all black.

21:12.425 --> 21:15.842
Now, browner than taco meat.
You know what I'm saying?

21:15.842 --> 21:18.383
- ( laughs )
- ( chuckles )

21:18.383 --> 21:20.758
Taco meat,
that's pretty good.

21:20.758 --> 21:22.717
Hey, my boy, go on,
get on the bus.

21:22.717 --> 21:24.341
Tie your shoes.
Both of y'all.

21:24.341 --> 21:26.383
And pull your pants up, son.
Yeah. Go, Daniel.

21:28.425 --> 21:29.967
( men chattering )

21:29.967 --> 21:31.800
- Wow, you pulled the trigger.
- I pulled the trigger.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.383
- I got it.
It's in the cellar.
- Hi!

21:33.383 --> 21:34.675
- Brett: Hey.
- Oh, hey. How are you?

21:34.675 --> 21:35.883
- You already got it?
- I got it.

21:35.883 --> 21:37.050
I'm gonna keep it
in the cellar

21:37.050 --> 21:38.383
until Kathy graduates
from college.

21:38.383 --> 21:40.341
So, how did
the lobster rolls

21:40.341 --> 21:41.925
taste for breakfast?

21:41.925 --> 21:44.175
Huh?

21:44.175 --> 21:46.550
Oh, oh, yeah, no.
Yeah, no, I didn't really--

21:46.550 --> 21:47.842
I didn't take those
with me.

21:47.842 --> 21:50.259
No, no, I know
that you wouldn't.

21:50.259 --> 21:52.842
Yeah. But you should
try the Latour.

21:52.842 --> 21:54.508
- Come over the house--
- Do you have a picture of it?

21:54.508 --> 21:56.259
- Oh, my God, yeah.
I got it on my phone.
- Really?

21:56.259 --> 21:58.217
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh, that'd be great.

23:25.009 --> 23:26.800
Molly.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.466
- Lawrence. What--
- Hey.

23:29.466 --> 23:30.383
Yeah.

23:32.341 --> 23:35.758
- What's up?
- Oh, I was just
at a client meeting.

23:35.758 --> 23:38.009
- What are you doing here?
- It's Meridian.

23:39.591 --> 23:41.092
Oh, cool.

23:42.883 --> 23:44.800
So, you're--
you're liking it?

23:44.800 --> 23:47.175
Yeah, it's good.

23:47.175 --> 23:48.633
- Good.
- You?

23:48.633 --> 23:51.300
- Work's good?
- Yeah, fine.

23:53.717 --> 23:56.675
All right, well, uh,
it was good seeing you.

23:58.425 --> 24:00.800
( groans )
Hey.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.134
How are you?

24:06.050 --> 24:08.842
- I mean...
- I know.

24:08.842 --> 24:10.383
Issa's still torn up.

24:12.134 --> 24:15.134
- And?
- She feels terrible,
Lawrence.

24:15.134 --> 24:16.717
She does.

24:16.717 --> 24:20.633
Issa cheated,
but she's not a cheater.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.717
Come on, you know
she still loves you.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.134
Do you hate her?

24:33.050 --> 24:34.550
No, I don't.

24:36.550 --> 24:38.134
Would you ever
take her back?

24:42.550 --> 24:44.800
Tasha:
That's exactly what
I was saying about her.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.300
- Exactly. Really.
- Woman: Yeah, I was just...

24:51.092 --> 24:52.591
( phone buzzing )

24:58.842 --> 25:01.758
- Hello?
- Molly: Hey, girl.
I just talked to Lawrence.

25:01.758 --> 25:05.217
I had to do, like,
five fake walk-bys
before he saw me.

25:05.217 --> 25:07.925
Oh, thanks for going
all the way over there for me.

25:07.925 --> 25:08.925
Of course.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.259
So, what did he say?

25:13.259 --> 25:14.591
( sighs )

25:16.550 --> 25:18.591
I'm sorry, Iss.

25:18.591 --> 25:20.050
Lawrence said
that he's done.

25:23.092 --> 25:25.050
He found a new apartment.

25:27.217 --> 25:29.300
I'm so sorry.

25:30.925 --> 25:32.842
You want me
to stop by later?

25:34.217 --> 25:36.466
What? No, that's...

25:36.466 --> 25:37.633
I'm fine.

25:37.633 --> 25:40.425
I'm here
if you need me, okay?

25:40.425 --> 25:41.800
Bye.

25:47.466 --> 25:48.466
( knocks )

25:48.466 --> 25:50.591
Ma'am, you cannot
sleep here.

25:59.842 --> 26:01.341
Molly:
I-- well, it shows
precedent.

26:01.341 --> 26:03.550
And I think
the Sycamore memo
might be useful here.

26:03.550 --> 26:04.967
Great, thank you.

26:04.967 --> 26:07.300
And we will follow up
with the client

26:07.300 --> 26:08.591
by EOD tomorrow.

26:08.591 --> 26:11.050
Oh, and, Hannah,
things were kind of hectic

26:11.050 --> 26:14.092
at your going-away party,
but I just wanted to say

26:14.092 --> 26:15.633
congratulations
on Chicago.

26:15.633 --> 26:17.675
Thank you, Molly.

26:17.675 --> 26:20.758
- It's an adjustment,
but, you know, I like it.
- ( chuckles )

26:20.758 --> 26:23.217
And I just want
to say if you ever need
any additional help,

26:23.217 --> 26:25.050
I'd love to offer
myself up.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.967
You know,
I really appreciated
learning from you

26:27.967 --> 26:31.341
and I'd love
the opportunity
to continue.

26:31.341 --> 26:34.050
( sighs )
You know, actually,
a couple cases

26:34.050 --> 26:37.092
have come across my desk
that I could bring you in on.

26:37.092 --> 26:39.050
If you don't mind
splitting your time

26:39.050 --> 26:41.217
between LA and Chicago
for a few months,

26:41.217 --> 26:43.883
then I would
welcome the help.

26:43.883 --> 26:45.383
I'm open to that.

26:45.383 --> 26:46.675
( chuckles )
Thank you.

26:46.675 --> 26:49.050
It's my pleasure.

26:49.050 --> 26:50.717
( door slams )

27:01.217 --> 27:02.092
Hey.

27:05.466 --> 27:07.883
Look, what happened
with me and Issa
shouldn't have.

27:07.883 --> 27:11.717
- Uh-huh.
- It was a mistake,
and, you know,

27:11.717 --> 27:13.550
you don't deserve that.

27:13.550 --> 27:15.466
I mean, hey,
it's whatever.

27:15.466 --> 27:16.967
I mean, that's your ex,
so it happens.

27:16.967 --> 27:18.925
We never said
we was exclusive anyway.

27:18.925 --> 27:21.717
Well, you know,
either way, it's over.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.300
I got some food
going on the stove,

27:27.300 --> 27:29.341
so I need to go
back inside.

27:30.675 --> 27:32.009
Okay.

27:32.009 --> 27:33.259
Okay.

27:41.050 --> 27:42.341
You hungry?

27:48.967 --> 27:52.341
Yeah, I could eat.
