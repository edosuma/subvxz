02:59.947 --> 03:00.815
Oh, shit!

07:12.199 --> 07:14.902
Get 'em up, get 'em
up! Move it, move it!

07:14.936 --> 07:16.203
Move it, move it, move it!

07:19.040 --> 07:20.875
Marine, what're you waiting for?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.111
No, please, don't!

07:27.982 --> 07:30.084
All right, move, move, move!

08:00.915 --> 08:03.818
All right, Mags, car is
packed.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.722
Time for your mother
and me to hit the road.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.858
Come on, dear, let's go.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.861
She can handle it, right, Mags?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.530
Love ya, kiddo.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.732
See you in a few days.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.235
Make sure the wolves don't
kill each other, okay?

09:41.115 --> 09:42.750
Just another day in paradise.

09:44.118 --> 09:46.153
Don't worry, sir, we'll find
him.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.828
Follow me.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.062
Yes, sir.

10:10.244 --> 10:11.078
Please, shut the door.

10:11.112 --> 10:12.213
Yes, sir.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.785
Hey look, Connor, I'm just
gonna get right after it.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.386
I got a call this morning
from Sarah Simmons

10:19.420 --> 10:20.754
over there on Ridge road.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.823
Sarah Simmons, Bobby's wife?

10:22.857 --> 10:25.826
Yeah, Bobby didn't come home
last night.

10:25.860 --> 10:27.228
She's worried sick about him.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.997
Now, you know it takes
about 24 hours for us

10:30.030 --> 10:31.999
to generate a missing person's
report.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.001
I think with everything
going on around here,

10:34.034 --> 10:35.836
I need for you to get out there
ASAP

10:35.870 --> 10:38.305
if we have any chance
of finding him alive.

10:38.339 --> 10:40.841
Yes, sir, me and Dave
will get right on it.

10:40.875 --> 10:42.042
Hang on, there's more.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.680
I need you to take care of
Dave while he's out there.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.150
Sir?

10:49.183 --> 10:51.886
Now, Dave and Bobby were
old high school buddies.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.120
I know my son.

10:53.154 --> 10:55.222
This might shake him up a bit.

10:55.256 --> 10:57.324
Yes, sir, anything you need.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.061
Now I know Dave can
be kind of an asshole,

11:01.095 --> 11:01.996
but you're doing a real good job

11:02.029 --> 11:04.131
of taking him under your wing.

11:04.165 --> 11:04.965
He doesn't have to know
everything

11:04.999 --> 11:08.836
while he's out there,
understand?

11:09.904 --> 11:10.771
Yes, sir.

11:41.202 --> 11:42.870
We have to get you a better
watch.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.004
Why, I have a phone.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.509
Nevermind, did you at
least check in this morning?

11:47.542 --> 11:48.510
Oh, my God, no.

11:48.543 --> 11:50.077
Hold up, it's fine.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.145
I got you, it's fine.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.714
All right, so what're we doing
today?

12:03.891 --> 12:04.792
I know this guy.

12:06.260 --> 12:07.094
Are you gonna be all
right to handle this?

12:07.127 --> 12:09.897
Yes, I'll be fine, damn.

12:11.065 --> 12:12.833
Look he's out there.

12:12.866 --> 12:13.867
They're all out there.

12:13.901 --> 12:14.768
We'll find them.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.039
I do have a serious question
though.

12:19.073 --> 12:19.940
Shoot.

12:20.642 --> 12:23.310
Before we get started,
can we please get a coffee?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.847
You gotta be kidding me,
right?

13:06.086 --> 13:07.555
Come on, buddy, come on.

13:07.589 --> 13:09.323
That a boy, let's go, come on.

13:09.356 --> 13:12.493
Come on, let's go,
buddy, come on, let's go!

13:25.607 --> 13:28.475
Hey, hey, hey, come on, whoa,
whoa!

14:08.182 --> 14:09.383
How are they doing today?

14:09.416 --> 14:11.952
Hungry as usual, very active.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.555
I hung their breakfast so
they would work for it,

14:13.588 --> 14:15.255
but they'd rather be hunting.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.457
That's good.

14:16.490 --> 14:17.659
Wolves will be wolves.

14:17.692 --> 14:18.992
How are we doing on meat?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.327
Um, we're okay with the red
meat.

14:20.361 --> 14:21.596
Little light on the chicken.

14:21.629 --> 14:23.631
Probably could use a
little bit more rabbit.

14:23.665 --> 14:25.366
Oh, yeah, sure.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.369
Anything else?

14:28.402 --> 14:30.437
Yeah, see if you can check
into getting a mammoth for us.

14:30.471 --> 14:32.640
That should last us about a
month or two.

14:32.674 --> 14:33.874
Good idea.

14:37.512 --> 14:38.946
Stop it, Todd.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.914
Lighten up, Mags.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.550
You're gonna wear yourself out.

14:42.584 --> 14:44.586
Your parents enjoyed doing this
job.

14:44.619 --> 14:46.487
That's what you gotta do.

14:46.521 --> 14:48.055
You know what?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.056
What?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.392
It's been a whole year
since they've been gone.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.995
I kinda had a feeling today
was gonna be a rough day.

14:55.028 --> 14:55.996
Well, I finally had the
courage

14:56.029 --> 14:58.232
to start going through
some of their things.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.668
You know, your parents,
they were good people.

15:01.636 --> 15:03.203
Dad was a genius.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.672
He knew so much about wolves,

15:04.706 --> 15:06.206
what they needed and when.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.074
How to take care of them.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.544
It was like he was part of the
pack.

15:09.577 --> 15:11.679
There's lots to live up to.

15:11.713 --> 15:13.213
Give it time.

15:13.247 --> 15:15.382
That's easy for you to say.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.284
This burden hasn't passed on to
you.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.722
Hey, you're not in this alone,
okay?

15:20.755 --> 15:21.955
I was there for your parents.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.056
I'll be there for you.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.693
I know, Todd, thank you.

15:25.727 --> 15:29.430
Don't mess with
that, seriously, you're family.

15:29.463 --> 15:31.265
Oh, that actually reminds me.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.399
When I was going through Dad's
things,

15:32.433 --> 15:34.334
I finally got myself to look in
the bag

15:34.368 --> 15:36.036
that they found at the scene
that night.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.572
They gave you that stuff?
I thought that was evidence?

15:37.605 --> 15:39.339
No, they let me have it.

15:39.373 --> 15:42.009
Anyway, it's over there with
some of my dad's old stuff

15:42.042 --> 15:43.310
if you want anything.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.045
Anything good in there?

15:45.078 --> 15:47.414
Just his camera and some
hunting gear.

15:47.448 --> 15:49.082
Oh, actually, there was
something interesting,

15:49.116 --> 15:50.685
this old book.

15:50.718 --> 15:53.555
A book, what kind of book?

15:53.588 --> 15:55.055
Well, it's gotta be
old.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.023
I mean hard to say really.

15:56.056 --> 15:56.691
I don't know.

15:56.724 --> 15:57.559
I didn't read it yet.

15:57.592 --> 16:00.160
Why trouble yourself with that
stuff?

16:00.194 --> 16:01.995
It's a waste of time.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.131
Geez, Todd, who needs to
lighten up now?

16:05.466 --> 16:06.266
I'm sorry, Mags.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.602
I'm just concerned about the
wolves

16:07.635 --> 16:09.369
and what were going through now.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.371
Can I show you something
out in the feeding pen?

16:11.405 --> 16:12.272
Yeah, sure.

16:16.109 --> 16:17.779
This better not be
expensive.

16:28.322 --> 16:31.693
Look, I know this case may
be a little bit rough on you.

16:31.726 --> 16:34.061
Man, I'm fine, seriously.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.663
Okay, the Chief is really
worried

16:35.697 --> 16:37.097
about you digging in on this
one.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.666
Yeah, telling you all this
stuff

16:38.700 --> 16:40.200
while keeping me in the dark?

16:40.234 --> 16:42.135
Dude, he doesn't have
any confidence in me.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.806
Man, he's just a father
trying to protect his kid.

16:44.839 --> 16:46.541
All right, he's trying to
protect everybody in this town.

16:46.574 --> 16:49.042
We need to cut the guy a
little slack, don't you think?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.545
If you say so, man.

16:50.578 --> 16:51.779
Come on, Dave.

16:51.813 --> 16:54.214
I know he has high expectations
of you, but for good reason.

16:54.248 --> 16:57.050
Dude, the only reason I'm
involved in any of this stuff

16:57.084 --> 16:58.352
is because I'm your partner.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.187
I'm just here for the ride.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.356
Come on, you bring a lot to
the table.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.390
Like what?

17:06.561 --> 17:09.764
Okay, Bobby, you and
him were friends, right?

17:09.797 --> 17:10.632
Right.

17:10.665 --> 17:11.566
Where would he be going?

17:11.599 --> 17:12.634
What would he be doing?

17:12.667 --> 17:14.836
You mean besides drinking?

17:14.869 --> 17:16.771
Yes, Dave, besides drinking.

17:16.804 --> 17:18.272
I don't know.

17:18.305 --> 17:19.641
I know he liked to fish.

17:19.674 --> 17:22.276
Fishing, well, there you go.

17:23.277 --> 17:24.679
Did a little detective work.

17:24.712 --> 17:25.880
If he liked to fish,

17:25.914 --> 17:27.715
he'd have to pass by Frank's
to pick up supplies, right?

17:27.749 --> 17:30.317
Let's go by there and see
if Frank seen anything.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.735
Hey, how's it going there,
Frank?

17:47.769 --> 17:49.369
Oh, hey, Connor.

17:51.773 --> 17:53.775
What can I do for ya?

17:53.808 --> 17:55.208
Frank, we got a call this
morning.

17:55.242 --> 17:58.245
Oh, was it about all
those folks going crazy

17:58.278 --> 18:00.548
and buying up all my inventory?

18:00.582 --> 18:01.849
I mean look at that.

18:01.883 --> 18:04.418
They bought up all the toilet
paper.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.755
Of all the things you'd think.

18:07.789 --> 18:10.324
No, Frank, it wasn't
about your toilet paper.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.793
I mean, that is weird though.

18:11.826 --> 18:13.460
Tell me about it.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.195
Frank, we're looking for Bobby
Simmons.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.129
We have reason to believe

18:16.163 --> 18:17.665
that he might've been by here
yesterday

18:17.699 --> 18:19.433
buying some fishing supplies.

18:19.466 --> 18:20.535
Have you seen him?

18:20.568 --> 18:25.472
Bobby Simmons, no, I can't
say that I have, sorry.

18:25.506 --> 18:26.708
Are you sure?

18:26.741 --> 18:30.912
I keep an eye on everybody
that comes in this place, okay?

18:30.945 --> 18:33.648
You never know if one
of those little fuckers

18:33.681 --> 18:35.415
might be that killer that's on
the loose.

18:35.449 --> 18:36.383
You know what I'm saying?

18:36.416 --> 18:39.754
Frank, come on, there's no
killer, okay?

18:39.787 --> 18:42.255
Just a few missing people,
that's all.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.559
I suppose Bobby's the next on
that list?

18:44.592 --> 18:46.527
Didn't say that either, Frank.

18:46.561 --> 18:48.161
I don't know.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.397
I've never seen people so
scared,

18:50.430 --> 18:51.866
and they're buying up all this
stuff,

18:51.899 --> 18:53.601
and locking themselves in their
houses.

18:53.635 --> 18:54.802
That's just not right.

18:54.836 --> 18:57.505
Frank, we're gonna
get to the bottom of it.

18:57.538 --> 19:00.340
You know, hearing you say
that,

19:00.374 --> 19:03.210
doesn't fill me with
one iota of confidence

19:03.243 --> 19:06.246
that this situation is gonna
get taken care of anytime soon.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.348
All right, Frank, let's calm
down.

19:08.382 --> 19:11.284
We have people working around
the clock on this, all right?

19:13.688 --> 19:15.288
Can I help you, miss?

19:15.322 --> 19:17.424
I'm looking for my
husband, Bobby Simmons.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.226
Thought he might've stopped in
here.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.160
Well, I'll be.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.429
So are these fine gentlemen
right here.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.599
Hi, Sarah, I'm Detective Ryan.

19:24.632 --> 19:25.600
You may know my partner, Dave.

19:25.633 --> 19:26.601
Yeah, I know Dave.

19:27.502 --> 19:28.936
What's going on?

19:28.970 --> 19:31.304
We were actually on
our way to come see you.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.473
Okay.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.443
Hey, Frank, can you give us a
sec?

19:37.578 --> 19:40.347
Sure, go ahead, help yourself.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.950
It's not like you don't have
an office about six doors down

19:42.984 --> 19:44.819
where you can conduct your
business.

19:48.589 --> 19:50.424
Sarah, we were assigned

19:50.457 --> 19:51.993
to your husband's case this
morning.

19:52.026 --> 19:53.695
I don't understand.

19:53.728 --> 19:56.396
They told me it had to
be at least 24 hours

19:56.430 --> 19:58.966
before anyone could do
anything, what's wrong?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.902
Well, that's usually
the case, all right,

20:00.935 --> 20:02.570
but as you know, Dave and Bobby

20:02.603 --> 20:03.905
were good friends in high
school,

20:03.938 --> 20:05.940
and he wanted to get a jump on
this one.

20:06.841 --> 20:07.709
Hey.

20:08.743 --> 20:10.410
Hello.

20:10.444 --> 20:12.513
What can you tell us, Sarah,
that might help us find him?

20:12.547 --> 20:13.881
Where would he be going?

20:13.915 --> 20:15.583
What would he be doing?

20:15.616 --> 20:16.450
His sorry ass is probably

20:16.483 --> 20:18.553
passed out drunk somewhere in
the mud.

20:18.586 --> 20:20.555
That does
sound like the Bobby I knew.

20:20.588 --> 20:23.591
This one time we found him
passed out on the floor of the...

20:27.528 --> 20:29.429
Now let's calm down here.

20:29.463 --> 20:30.765
Take a deep breath.

20:30.798 --> 20:31.833
What can you tell us, Sarah?

20:31.866 --> 20:33.668
He might be the town drunk,

20:33.701 --> 20:36.838
but he's a good man, a good man.

20:37.739 --> 20:40.942
Yes, nobody said anything
differently.

20:40.975 --> 20:42.910
What happened last night?

20:42.944 --> 20:45.546
I already told the guy
on the phone earlier.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.014
I understand, ma'am,

20:47.048 --> 20:49.517
but it would really help me
if I could hear it again.

20:53.621 --> 20:56.758
So, last night him and
I,

20:56.791 --> 20:59.359
well, we kinda got into a little
argument,

20:59.392 --> 21:01.428
but then he stormed off in his
truck,

21:01.461 --> 21:03.463
and said he needed to blow off
some steam.

21:03.497 --> 21:06.433
Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.336
What made you think to look for
him here?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.438
Well, if he's not out
drinking at the fuckin' bar,

21:12.106 --> 21:13.373
he's usually fishing.

21:15.543 --> 21:17.477
Okay, Sarah, that helps a lot.

21:17.512 --> 21:19.614
All right, there's only
a few spots on that river

21:19.647 --> 21:20.648
he can get to at night.

21:20.681 --> 21:21.716
Won't you just go on home.

21:21.749 --> 21:23.718
Me and Dave will go around
there and take a look.

21:23.751 --> 21:25.686
If we find anything,
we'll give you a call.

21:25.720 --> 21:26.754
Does that sound good?

21:28.589 --> 21:29.991
Yeah, good idea.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.028
Thank you.

21:35.930 --> 21:36.564
You're welcome.

22:01.856 --> 22:03.624
Oh, shit, there's Bobby's
truck.

22:20.675 --> 22:22.043
Oh, my God, that stinks.

22:22.076 --> 22:22.910
What is that?

22:31.185 --> 22:32.720
Oh, Jesus, nasty!

22:41.095 --> 22:42.697
Yeah, he's not there either.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.635
Let's go down this way.

22:47.668 --> 22:49.402
Yeah, let's do that.

23:15.730 --> 23:16.731
All right, listen.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.467
There's two trails.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.537
You're gonna go down that way.

23:23.571 --> 23:25.072
I'm gonna go down this way.

23:25.106 --> 23:26.908
All right.

24:34.041 --> 24:38.212
Oh, shit, Connor, Connor,
Connor, Connor!

24:46.654 --> 24:47.788
Son of a bitch.

24:51.659 --> 24:52.526
What is that?

24:55.896 --> 24:57.832
Christ, dude, he's been torn
apart!

24:57.865 --> 25:00.101
Easy, calm down.

25:00.134 --> 25:02.003
Assess the situation.

25:02.036 --> 25:03.237
What's missing here?

25:03.270 --> 25:04.739
His leg!

25:04.772 --> 25:06.774
Yeah, Dave, I know his leg,
but look.

25:06.807 --> 25:08.943
There's no flies, maggots,
nothing.

25:08.976 --> 25:10.277
Maggots, what does that
have to do with anything?

25:10.311 --> 25:13.714
Bobby's truck, they were full
of them.

25:13.748 --> 25:16.017
Look at this, there's nothing.

25:16.050 --> 25:17.785
This kill is just a few hours
old.

25:19.120 --> 25:23.257
And this, does that look
like a coyote print to you?

25:23.290 --> 25:25.693
No, dude, that would
be a big ass coyote!

25:27.995 --> 25:30.297
Hey, Dave, do you remember
that girl last summer.

25:30.331 --> 25:31.766
You mean the wolf girl?

25:31.799 --> 25:33.567
Yeah, Dave, the wolf girl.

25:33.601 --> 25:35.569
I think we should call
her and get her up here.

25:35.603 --> 25:37.038
Oh, Jesus.

25:37.071 --> 25:38.606
Are you okay?

25:38.639 --> 25:40.574
No, dude, before we had

25:40.608 --> 25:42.076
just a bunch of missing person
reports.

25:42.109 --> 25:43.911
I figured eventually they
would just turn back up,

25:43.944 --> 25:44.912
and now we have this,

25:44.945 --> 25:46.147
and you're talking about wolves?

25:46.180 --> 25:47.681
Calm the fuck down!

25:47.715 --> 25:49.817
This is the job you signed up
for!

25:49.850 --> 25:50.618
Now, do me a favor!

25:50.651 --> 25:52.953
Go back there and call Dr.
Keely!

25:52.987 --> 25:53.654
Dr. Keely?

25:53.687 --> 25:55.156
The fuckin' coroner, Dave!

25:55.189 --> 25:56.057
Okay!

26:09.770 --> 26:10.638
Okay.

26:18.712 --> 26:19.613
Shit.

26:50.077 --> 26:51.112
Maggie Talbot.

26:51.145 --> 26:53.114
Miss Talbot, this is Detective
Ryan

26:53.147 --> 26:55.082
at Mantua Police Department.

26:55.116 --> 26:56.750
Connor?

26:56.784 --> 26:58.152
You remember?

26:58.185 --> 26:59.854
What can I do for you?

26:59.887 --> 27:02.756
Maggie, it seems that we
have another animal attack.

27:02.790 --> 27:03.424
And you're calling me?

27:03.457 --> 27:05.159
You must think it's a wolf.

27:05.192 --> 27:06.961
I don't know to be honest with
you.

27:06.994 --> 27:08.996
There's a lot about this
case I don't understand.

27:09.029 --> 27:11.098
I could really use your
insight on this one.

27:11.765 --> 27:13.834
Well, wolves haven't
been seen in the wild

27:13.868 --> 27:17.071
in this part of the country for
decades.

27:17.104 --> 27:18.839
I'll leave out the details for
now,

27:18.873 --> 27:20.074
but it's pretty violent.

27:20.107 --> 27:23.043
Okay, you know wolves are
highly misunderstood creatures,

27:23.077 --> 27:26.213
and very rarely attack
humans, I mean.

27:26.247 --> 27:28.215
Yes, ma'am, I understand,

27:28.249 --> 27:30.885
but there's really something
off about this one.

27:30.918 --> 27:32.753
You could have coywolves.

27:32.786 --> 27:33.821
What's a coywolf?

27:34.523 --> 27:36.457
It's a crossbreed between
a coyote and a wolf.

27:36.490 --> 27:39.126
You know wolves have been known
to cross with other species.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.427
That can actually happen?

27:40.461 --> 27:41.630
Yeah, of course.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.397
I mean I'd have to see the
evidence to know for sure, but.

27:43.430 --> 27:46.267
Well, listen, this
is out of my skill set.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.002
Are you available to come take a
look?

27:48.035 --> 27:48.969
Sure.

27:50.237 --> 27:51.372
How soon could you get here?

27:51.405 --> 27:52.574
Um, not long.

27:52.607 --> 27:55.309
I just have to pack a few
things and I'll be on my way.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.444
Sounds good, thank you.

28:02.816 --> 28:05.920
Hmm.

28:26.307 --> 28:27.241
Hold it, hold up!

28:27.274 --> 28:29.210
- What's going on?
- The police down in Mantua

28:29.243 --> 28:31.478
think that someone was attacked
by a wolf.

28:31.513 --> 28:33.380
A wolf in that area, bullshit.

28:33.414 --> 28:34.448
That's what the man said.

28:34.481 --> 28:35.482
You want me to come with you?

28:35.517 --> 28:37.017
No, it's probably just a
coyote,

28:37.051 --> 28:39.019
but just in case I'm gonna check
it out.

28:39.053 --> 28:40.354
I should come with you, hold
on.

28:40.387 --> 28:41.288
Let me get a few things, all
right?

28:41.322 --> 28:42.524
No, no, Todd, don't worry
about it.

28:42.557 --> 28:43.224
I got this.

28:43.257 --> 28:44.959
You stay here with the wolves.

28:46.260 --> 28:48.195
Don't go chasing that legend.

28:48.229 --> 28:50.130
Legend, what're you talking
about?

28:52.132 --> 28:54.335
Nothing, just be careful.

28:54.368 --> 28:56.538
In fact, take this.

28:56.571 --> 28:58.339
Come on, I don't need a gun.

28:58.372 --> 29:00.374
No, seriously, please, take
it.

29:02.977 --> 29:04.411
Fine.

29:06.247 --> 29:07.915
I'll be back in a day or two,
okay?

29:22.597 --> 29:24.164
Oh, man.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.368
Hey, Connor!

30:03.971 --> 30:05.472
What the fuck is wrong with
you?

30:05.507 --> 30:07.041
You look good on
camera, man.

30:07.074 --> 30:08.610
You could be one of
those outdoorsy models.

30:08.643 --> 30:09.476
You know what?

30:09.511 --> 30:10.177
One minute you're pissing your
pants.

30:10.210 --> 30:13.213
Next you're a fuckin' paparazzi.

30:14.649 --> 30:17.184
I swear you have multi
personalities.

32:14.669 --> 32:16.236
I knew it.

32:16.270 --> 32:17.438
I'm so sorry.

32:25.145 --> 32:27.281
Check this out.

32:27.314 --> 32:28.315
Scandal.

32:28.348 --> 32:30.250
I know, right?

32:30.284 --> 32:31.452
What do you think they're
saying?

32:31.485 --> 32:33.187
Something messy, that's for
sure.

32:33.220 --> 32:35.055
Definitely, and she's all
like,

32:35.088 --> 32:37.692
"You have to leave before my
loser husband comes home."

32:37.725 --> 32:39.627
Yeah, and he's like,
"You're totally right, babe.

32:39.661 --> 32:41.295
"That dude totally sucks."

32:41.328 --> 32:42.329
"We can't keep doing this.

32:42.362 --> 32:44.465
"It's just , too much."

32:44.498 --> 32:45.767
"Fine, if you want it that
way,

32:45.800 --> 32:48.135
"I'll take this fine ass
somewhere else."

32:49.537 --> 32:51.138
Oh, shit, I think he heard us.

32:51.171 --> 32:53.608
Relax, can't hear us from
all the way over there.

32:55.075 --> 32:56.511
Ah, could he?

32:57.411 --> 32:58.479
Fuck, he did.

32:58.513 --> 33:01.281
That dude has incredible
hearing.

33:01.315 --> 33:03.350
And an incredible ass.

33:03.383 --> 33:05.687
Oh, please, he's so out of our
league.

33:05.720 --> 33:07.522
Speak for yourself, sister.

33:09.757 --> 33:11.158
Look, look, watch.

33:12.627 --> 33:13.528
Damn.

33:46.594 --> 33:47.427
Can I help you, miss?

33:47.461 --> 33:49.263
Yes, I'm here to see Detective
Ryan.

33:49.296 --> 33:50.497
He's expecting me.

33:50.532 --> 33:51.599
And who should I say is here?

33:51.633 --> 33:52.567
Maggie Talbot.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.234
Okay, ah, just take a seat,
Miss Talbot.

33:54.268 --> 33:56.069
He'll be out in just a few
moments.

33:58.372 --> 34:00.407
You have a Maggie Talbot here to
see you.

34:06.246 --> 34:07.080
Miss Talbot.

34:07.114 --> 34:08.181
Please call me Maggie.

34:08.215 --> 34:09.851
Of course, thank you for
coming by.

34:09.884 --> 34:10.752
Come on back.

34:16.423 --> 34:17.759
So Maggie how is it you
have so much knowledge

34:17.792 --> 34:18.693
in this field?

34:18.726 --> 34:20.762
I mean, to be completely honest
with you,

34:20.795 --> 34:22.530
a lot of people thought
you were crazy last year

34:22.564 --> 34:24.398
looking for wolves in Ohio.

34:24.431 --> 34:25.867
Well, it's
in the family business.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.434
My parents raised me in this
life.

34:27.467 --> 34:29.303
So they help you with this?

34:30.337 --> 34:31.706
Ah, not anymore, no.

34:33.575 --> 34:35.275
Off the better things, I
guess.

34:36.711 --> 34:37.745
Ah, not exactly.

34:37.779 --> 34:40.815
Last year, we lost on an
expedition in Alaska, so.

34:41.916 --> 34:44.284
Oh, Maggie, I...

34:44.318 --> 34:45.452
No, I mean, it's not your
fault.

34:45.485 --> 34:46.754
They were actually up there

34:46.788 --> 34:49.156
looking for wolf pack territory
patterns

34:49.189 --> 34:50.892
when they both went missing.

34:50.925 --> 34:53.728
I am so sorry, really.

34:53.761 --> 34:56.463
It seems like you have a lot
of resilience carrying on.

34:56.496 --> 34:57.331
Well, the conservation
center's

34:57.364 --> 34:59.399
what keeps their legacy alive
for me.

34:59.433 --> 35:00.835
Of course, I understand.

35:04.204 --> 35:06.608
Well, I don't wanna take
up too much of your time,

35:07.709 --> 35:09.142
but here's some of the tufts of
hair

35:09.176 --> 35:11.378
that we found around the body.

35:11.411 --> 35:12.279
The body?

35:13.180 --> 35:14.348
I didn't mention it?

35:14.381 --> 35:15.817
No, you said there was an
animal attack.

35:15.850 --> 35:17.284
You thought it was wolves.

35:18.418 --> 35:20.922
Well, technically you said
wolves.

35:20.955 --> 35:24.759
Semantics, I think we're
getting off track here.

35:24.792 --> 35:27.160
Yeah, you're right.

35:27.194 --> 35:29.530
Is there anything else to show
me here?

35:29.564 --> 35:33.367
Yes, actually I found
some interesting remains.

35:34.969 --> 35:36.571
This doesn't make any sense.

35:37.337 --> 35:39.339
Wolves don't really attack
people.

35:39.373 --> 35:40.775
Not to mention they've all been
eradicated

35:40.808 --> 35:42.710
from the lower 48.

35:42.744 --> 35:44.746
It's just hard to believe a
pack large enough to do this

35:44.779 --> 35:46.346
would go undetected.

35:55.590 --> 35:57.257
Am I interrupting anything?

35:59.459 --> 36:01.663
Maggie, I think you
know my partner, Dave.

36:01.696 --> 36:02.530
Yeah, of course.

36:02.563 --> 36:03.531
Nice to see you again.

36:03.564 --> 36:06.668
Likewise, so what do
you make of all this?

36:06.701 --> 36:07.669
I'm not sure yet.

36:07.702 --> 36:09.236
I mean, I have to see
more evidence of wolves

36:09.269 --> 36:10.705
to make a determination.

36:10.738 --> 36:13.206
Dave, did you process
the photos of Bobby yet?

36:13.240 --> 36:16.343
No, no, but you can
take her

36:16.376 --> 36:18.478
to go see the body in person,
can't you?

36:18.513 --> 36:19.614
That's a good idea.

36:19.647 --> 36:21.248
Would you be up to that, Maggie?

36:21.281 --> 36:22.717
Sure.

36:22.750 --> 36:25.720
I think I'll stay here and
finish processing the evidence.

36:27.320 --> 36:28.790
I'll drive.

36:49.610 --> 36:50.444
Oh, hello, Connor.

36:50.477 --> 36:51.445
Hi, Dr. Keely.

36:51.478 --> 36:53.614
This is Maggie Talbot
from the Wolf sanctuary.

36:53.648 --> 36:54.916
Oh, yes, nice to meet you,
Maggie.

36:54.949 --> 36:56.718
Forgive me for not shaking your
hand.

36:56.751 --> 36:57.752
Oh, no problem.

36:59.286 --> 37:03.290
Well, since we're all
here, brace yourself.

37:03.323 --> 37:03.991
It's not pretty.

37:09.429 --> 37:13.366
You can clearly see the teeth
marks here,

37:13.400 --> 37:16.738
but not on the leg where you
might expect.

37:16.771 --> 37:18.940
It's more of a tear than a bite
here.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.711
Are you okay, Maggie?

37:23.745 --> 37:25.613
Yeah, I'm
fine.

37:25.646 --> 37:28.049
There's just something
really strange about this.

37:28.082 --> 37:30.383
It looks like a straight kill.

37:30.417 --> 37:31.652
What do you mean straight
kill?

37:31.686 --> 37:33.521
I was thinking the same thing.

37:33.554 --> 37:34.589
What she's saying is that it
doesn't look

37:34.622 --> 37:37.725
as though anything was
consumed, not much anyway.

37:37.759 --> 37:39.961
It's obvious this animal
didn't kill for food.

37:39.994 --> 37:41.294
I mean this type of aggression

37:41.328 --> 37:44.665
could be a possible territorial
issue.

37:44.699 --> 37:46.768
Like protecting a den of pups?

37:46.801 --> 37:48.669
I mean that's possible, but
unlikely.

37:48.703 --> 37:51.404
It still would've consumed the
meat.

37:54.008 --> 37:56.811
There's a lot here that
doesn't make sense yet.

37:56.844 --> 37:59.479
We still have a lot more
investigating to do.

37:59.514 --> 38:01.314
Have you had a chance to
check out the other remains yet?

38:01.348 --> 38:03.985
Not yet, I kind of got my
hands full with this one.

38:04.018 --> 38:05.086
Of course, ma'am.

38:05.119 --> 38:07.387
I'll let you know as soon
as I find anything new.

38:07.420 --> 38:09.023
Thanks, Doc, appreciate it.

38:34.481 --> 38:37.018
Skee, Skee, damn it, Skee, no!

38:39.921 --> 38:42.590
God damn, Skee, look at me!

38:42.623 --> 38:43.925
Skee, look at me!

38:43.958 --> 38:45.492
Hold on, hold on!

38:46.727 --> 38:48.529
Don't, Skee, God, no!

38:50.998 --> 38:51.866
No!

38:55.570 --> 38:58.139
Ryan, your pickup is ready
at the pharmacy counter.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.340
Ryan, the pharmacy counter.

39:11.619 --> 39:12.553
Maggie, you should know

39:12.587 --> 39:14.121
that people have gone missing
around here.

39:15.056 --> 39:16.157
We have this case.

39:16.190 --> 39:19.961
Really it's all these cases
and it's got me stumped.

39:19.994 --> 39:23.030
And until today, I thought all
these cases were unrelated.

39:23.764 --> 39:26.634
Wait, so Bobby isn't the
only one you're working on?

39:29.971 --> 39:32.006
Really, it's not safe around
here.

39:32.039 --> 39:32.807
You know, we should go get your
car,

39:32.840 --> 39:34.642
and I'll follow you to the
hotel,

39:34.675 --> 39:37.178
and we'll just pick this
back up in the morning.

40:25.092 --> 40:26.027
You got a second, Chief?

40:26.060 --> 40:27.028
Yeah, come on in.

40:30.131 --> 40:32.900
Need to give my eyes a rest
from these reports anyhow.

40:33.901 --> 40:35.468
Anything new to report?

40:35.503 --> 40:36.871
I mean, yeah.

40:36.904 --> 40:38.906
I just got a bad feeling about
all this.

41:25.252 --> 41:26.587
Hey there, boss.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.089
Hey, find any wolves?

41:28.122 --> 41:28.956
Well, we found something,

41:28.990 --> 41:31.125
although I don't think it's
wolves.

41:31.158 --> 41:33.160
Coyotes then, just like you
thought.

41:33.194 --> 41:35.763
Not unless a coyote can
tear the legs off a man.

41:35.796 --> 41:36.630
Wait a minute.

41:36.664 --> 41:37.698
What did you say?

41:37.732 --> 41:39.533
They found a body out
here that was torn apart.

41:39.567 --> 41:41.302
It's got slashes and teeth
marks,

41:41.335 --> 41:42.870
but nothing like I've ever seen,
Todd.

41:42.903 --> 41:45.172
Hold up, are you safe?

41:45.206 --> 41:46.874
Yeah, Todd, I'm fine.

41:46.907 --> 41:49.076
Have you heard of anything like
this?

41:49.110 --> 41:51.078
Listen, Maggie, stay where you
are.

41:51.112 --> 41:52.646
Don't go out.

41:52.680 --> 41:53.848
I'm on my way to you.

41:53.881 --> 41:55.316
Wait, what aren't you telling
me?

41:55.349 --> 41:57.251
I'll explain when I get there.

41:57.284 --> 41:58.886
Just stay safe.

41:58.919 --> 42:00.221
I'll call when I'm close.

42:11.599 --> 42:13.634
So, if what you're telling me
is true,

42:13.667 --> 42:14.902
we have a killer on the loose.

42:14.935 --> 42:17.104
Well, yeah, we have
to tell people, right?

42:17.972 --> 42:20.074
Have you looked around
when you've been out there?

42:20.107 --> 42:21.776
People are already hiding
scared.

42:21.809 --> 42:24.245
Last thing we wanna do is
create any sort of panic.

42:26.213 --> 42:27.248
Yea, come on in, Connor.

42:28.783 --> 42:29.817
What do you think of all this?

42:29.850 --> 42:31.218
To be honest, sir, I'm not
sure,

42:31.252 --> 42:32.219
but I do know we don't need
people

42:32.253 --> 42:33.654
walking on the streets at night.

42:33.687 --> 42:36.157
Seems to be when all the action
happens.

42:36.190 --> 42:37.992
Hmm, that's a good idea.

42:38.025 --> 42:41.162
Maybe we need to issue a
temporary curfew.

42:41.195 --> 42:41.996
Yes, sir.

42:42.029 --> 42:44.165
I think I'll give a mayor
call.

42:44.198 --> 42:45.766
I just said that.

44:30.304 --> 44:32.072
Call Detective Ryan.

44:34.375 --> 44:36.210
Dr. Keely, what've you got?

44:36.243 --> 44:39.380
Some information for you
on those skeletal remains.

44:39.413 --> 44:40.247
I'm listening.

44:40.281 --> 44:41.315
We ran some tests,

44:41.348 --> 44:43.717
and determined that some
of the bones were broken.

44:43.751 --> 44:44.885
Based on how you found them,

44:44.919 --> 44:48.255
this would indicate a heavy
impact or a blunt trauma.

44:48.289 --> 44:49.256
That's not good.

44:49.290 --> 44:51.158
Exactly, but that's not all.

44:51.192 --> 44:54.328
We found multiple stress
fractures on the skull.

44:54.361 --> 44:55.963
How could that have happened?

44:55.996 --> 44:57.498
Well, the fracture patterns
indicate

44:57.532 --> 45:00.367
equal pressure from
both sides of the skull.

45:00.401 --> 45:04.772
Perhaps the vic's head
was squeezed or crushed.

45:04.805 --> 45:07.474
Oh, shit, any more on the
ID's?

45:07.509 --> 45:09.143
The lab reports indicate the
DNA

45:09.176 --> 45:11.412
is consistent with the
first missing person.

45:11.445 --> 45:13.414
So, it's related?

45:13.447 --> 45:14.815
I'm still waiting on reports

45:14.848 --> 45:16.050
of the second set for
confirmation.

45:16.083 --> 45:18.085
Okay, thanks, Doc.

45:18.118 --> 45:19.353
Hey, Connor, wait.

45:19.386 --> 45:20.321
Yeah.

45:20.354 --> 45:22.122
Be careful out there.

45:22.156 --> 45:25.125
I've never seen anything like
this before.

45:25.159 --> 45:26.293
Right.

46:07.301 --> 46:09.069
Did you have trouble finding
the place?

46:09.103 --> 46:10.004
You know me, Mags.

46:10.037 --> 46:11.939
I can track anything down,
especially you.

46:13.007 --> 46:14.174
Let's just get to it.

46:15.476 --> 46:17.211
What aren't you telling me,
Todd?

46:28.055 --> 46:29.990
What'd you bring that for?

46:30.991 --> 46:34.161
I promised your dad,
I wouldn't get you involved in this,

46:37.398 --> 46:40.000
and now I gotta break that
promise, Mag.

46:40.034 --> 46:41.068
Involved with what?

46:43.137 --> 46:45.039
Look, I lied to you earlier.

46:45.072 --> 46:47.875
I know exactly what this
is and what it's all about.

46:48.677 --> 46:51.178
This is your dad's hunting guide
of sort.

46:51.211 --> 46:54.148
All his information, what
he's done, et cetera.

46:54.181 --> 46:55.550
What are you talking about?

47:00.321 --> 47:01.255
He was a hunter,

47:05.159 --> 47:06.427
and he hunted werewolves.

47:08.929 --> 47:12.534
Todd, are
you having a stroke?

47:13.334 --> 47:16.538
I mean, what do you mean
werewolves,

47:16.571 --> 47:19.073
like shape-shifting, eat your
livestock

47:19.106 --> 47:21.442
in the middle of the night
werewolves, I mean?

47:25.212 --> 47:27.915
No, no, no, no, no, that
can't be true.

47:29.316 --> 47:31.418
This, this can't be true.

47:32.986 --> 47:34.522
It is, all of it is.

47:38.660 --> 47:43.864
So when Mom
and Dad went missing,

47:45.499 --> 47:48.636
they were hunting werewolves.

47:50.270 --> 47:54.576
Yes, I, I had a vision.

47:54.609 --> 47:57.478
I told your dad, don't go on
this.

47:57.512 --> 47:59.113
I've got a bad feeling,

47:59.146 --> 48:00.682
but he insisted on wanting to
go.

48:00.715 --> 48:03.183
He says, stay back, take care of
Mags

48:03.217 --> 48:05.419
in case something happens to us
and I did.

48:11.158 --> 48:12.426
Are they dead?

48:13.595 --> 48:16.096
I don't, I don't know.

48:16.130 --> 48:18.533
I, I don't know, Mags, I
honestly don't.

48:18.566 --> 48:21.268
Jesus.

48:32.980 --> 48:36.049
Tell me everything you
know, and start with that.

48:38.085 --> 48:39.219
Okay, I will.

48:46.594 --> 48:48.028
Wolves haven't been seen in
the wild

48:48.061 --> 48:50.665
in this part of the country for
decades.

48:53.133 --> 48:55.335
Wolves are highly misunderstood
creatures,

48:55.369 --> 48:58.172
and very rarely attack humans.

49:01.241 --> 49:04.445
It's obvious this animal
didn't kill for food.

49:04.478 --> 49:05.713
There's just something really
strange

49:05.747 --> 49:07.347
about this type of aggression.

49:21.028 --> 49:22.597
This is really tough to
translate.

49:22.630 --> 49:24.998
We realize the languages
here aren't all the same.

49:25.032 --> 49:27.569
Some go back centuries, even
more,

49:27.602 --> 49:29.136
from all over the world.

49:29.169 --> 49:31.639
Most from which we don't have
record of.

49:31.673 --> 49:34.408
So, whoever assembled this
must have been a hunter.

49:34.441 --> 49:36.210
As long as werewolves have
been around,

49:36.243 --> 49:38.212
there've been people hunting
them.

49:38.245 --> 49:40.380
You sound like you're on
the side of the werewolves.

49:40.414 --> 49:42.584
You have to understand
werewolves are people too.

49:42.617 --> 49:45.620
They are literally tortured
with this condition.

49:45.653 --> 49:47.488
It's not their fault they're
like this.

49:47.522 --> 49:50.725
They've experienced great
trauma and they're cursed.

49:50.758 --> 49:54.161
We only kill werewolves if
we have to to protect others.

49:54.194 --> 49:55.128
Well, the people of this town

49:55.162 --> 49:57.532
need protecting from
what's out there, Todd.

49:58.398 --> 50:01.435
Look here, we know the
werewolves emerge at night,

50:01.468 --> 50:03.470
but during the day they're
human,

50:03.505 --> 50:06.340
and almost always
demonstrates these symptoms.

50:08.610 --> 50:09.443
Have you encountered anyone here

50:09.476 --> 50:11.579
in this town with these
descriptions?

50:12.279 --> 50:14.414
No, but Connor might know
something.

50:22.524 --> 50:23.457
I got it.

50:24.692 --> 50:25.693
Ryan.

50:25.727 --> 50:26.528
Connor, it's Maggie.

50:26.561 --> 50:29.229
I got something here you need to
see.

50:29.263 --> 50:30.464
You're still at the hotel,
right?

50:30.497 --> 50:31.699
Yeah.

50:31.733 --> 50:33.300
Okay, give me an hour or so.

50:33.333 --> 50:35.703
I'm just finishing up at
around here, hang tight.

50:54.454 --> 50:56.323
Hey, Connor, thanks for
coming.

50:56.356 --> 50:57.391
Of course.

50:57.424 --> 50:58.492
This is my friend,
Todd, from the sanctuary.

50:58.526 --> 50:59.594
Nice to meet you.

50:59.627 --> 51:02.396
Likewise, please have a seat.

51:05.132 --> 51:06.768
So, Connor, I noticed on my way
in,

51:06.801 --> 51:09.804
the town's pretty dead, nobody
around?

51:09.837 --> 51:13.140
Yeah, well, empty street
make my job a lot easier.

51:14.474 --> 51:15.342
I bet.

51:17.377 --> 51:20.515
Todd can be very
observant.

51:20.548 --> 51:21.415
I bet.

51:25.352 --> 51:27.387
So ah, what've we got here?

51:28.523 --> 51:30.257
Do you wanna tell him, or
should I?

51:31.593 --> 51:33.160
Tell me what?

51:46.340 --> 51:48.543
Ugh, whatever, Karen!

51:55.783 --> 51:57.919
I see a little bit of
a carcass or something.

51:57.952 --> 51:58.786
A carcass?

51:58.820 --> 51:59.687
Yeah.

52:07.394 --> 52:08.228
I fuckin' told you.

52:12.700 --> 52:13.568
Hello?

52:14.468 --> 52:15.502
Get me out of here.

52:16.436 --> 52:18.940
Why, more lame suburban crime?

52:18.973 --> 52:22.342
No, dude, my mom is
driving me fucking crazy.

52:22.376 --> 52:23.377
I need to go out.

52:23.410 --> 52:24.712
What are you doing later?

52:26.446 --> 52:28.549
We interrupt this program
for a special report.

52:28.583 --> 52:29.684
Hold on.

52:32.219 --> 52:33.521
We're asking all the residents

52:33.554 --> 52:35.389
to stay off the streets tonight.

52:35.422 --> 52:38.660
We will be issuing a curfew
just as a precaution.

52:39.459 --> 52:41.729
Jer, are you watching
the news right now?

52:41.763 --> 52:43.230
Ah, ew, no.

52:44.164 --> 52:47.635
Our main objective is
to keep everyone safe.

52:47.669 --> 52:51.806
Please just stay calm
and comply to this order.

52:51.839 --> 52:54.341
Well, apparently we're
not doing anything later.

52:54.374 --> 52:56.276
The Chief has ordered us
to stay off the streets,

52:56.309 --> 52:58.278
and we have some sort of curfew
now.

52:59.346 --> 53:00.180
It's not a problem.

53:00.213 --> 53:02.416
We'll just go to our spot in the
woods.

53:02.449 --> 53:05.687
See, I follow rules, no streets.

53:05.720 --> 53:07.722
You're so clever.

53:07.755 --> 53:11.291
I know, grab Jessica
and meet me there later.

53:11.324 --> 53:12.192
Okay, whatever.

53:12.994 --> 53:14.529
Follow these orders,

53:14.562 --> 53:16.964
and that is how we will all stay
safe.

53:16.998 --> 53:18.933
Thank you for your cooperation,

53:18.966 --> 53:21.602
and we will plan to
keep the public informed

53:21.636 --> 53:23.571
of any new developments as they
arise.

53:48.062 --> 53:52.033
Jesus, this is a lot to take
in.

53:52.066 --> 53:53.333
Hmm.

53:53.366 --> 53:55.036
And you believe this.

53:55.069 --> 53:56.671
Honestly, I do.

53:56.704 --> 53:58.639
I mean everything I
saw, everything I know,

53:58.673 --> 54:01.509
it just points to this being
real.

54:02.476 --> 54:04.011
Well then I
guess I have no choice

54:04.045 --> 54:05.513
but to believe it too,

54:05.546 --> 54:07.481
even though I don't want to.

54:07.515 --> 54:08.649
Then you and I need to get out
there

54:08.683 --> 54:09.517
and hunt this thing down

54:09.550 --> 54:11.686
before it kills somebody else,
okay.

54:11.719 --> 54:13.721
Wait, like now?

54:13.755 --> 54:14.722
That's not a good idea.

54:14.756 --> 54:16.824
Look, I've been doing
this for a while now.

54:16.858 --> 54:18.793
We need to hunt this thing down
tonight.

54:18.826 --> 54:19.761
That's not safe.

54:20.661 --> 54:22.630
Trust me, I'll meet up

54:22.663 --> 54:23.831
with you guys tomorrow morning,
okay?

54:23.865 --> 54:25.800
No, you're not going out there
alone.

54:25.833 --> 54:28.268
Maggie's right, we
should wait till morning.

54:30.638 --> 54:32.640
Okay, first light, all right?

54:32.673 --> 54:33.708
Come dawn, we break.

54:34.809 --> 54:36.544
So we're in agreement.

54:36.577 --> 54:38.746
Don't you stick around here
tonight.

54:38.780 --> 54:40.548
Agreed, right, Todd?

54:40.581 --> 54:44.552
Right, all right, well,
I'll be back in the morning.

54:54.796 --> 54:57.330
I think we need to watch
yourselves around him.

54:58.431 --> 55:00.034
Who, Connor, why?

55:00.067 --> 55:01.269
I don't know.

55:01.301 --> 55:03.971
There's something about him and
I can't put my finger on it.

55:06.607 --> 55:07.642
Well, come on.

55:07.675 --> 55:10.111
Let's find you a room in
this place, I'm exhausted.

57:13.634 --> 57:16.871
Hey, Chief, you working late?

57:16.904 --> 57:19.840
Yeah, and the work's never
done.

57:19.874 --> 57:20.741
Come on in.

57:27.915 --> 57:28.916
So anything new?

57:29.617 --> 57:32.153
No Connor's out on
a couple of leads now,

57:32.186 --> 57:34.221
and I've been going through
these crime scene photos

57:34.255 --> 57:35.623
trying to figure out if there's
something

57:35.656 --> 57:37.024
we possibly could have missed.

57:37.058 --> 57:38.659
Divide and conquer.

57:38.693 --> 57:40.061
Something like that.

57:42.530 --> 57:43.531
You look fried, Dad.

57:44.332 --> 57:46.767
Didn't Connor tell you to
call me Chief around here?

57:46.801 --> 57:49.036
Right, but I'm talking as your
son now.

57:49.070 --> 57:51.238
You can't help anybody like
this.

57:51.272 --> 57:52.974
Yeah, maybe you're right.

57:53.007 --> 57:57.044
So much for easing out of
this job and into retirement.

57:57.078 --> 57:59.046
Stop, that's what quitters
say.

57:59.080 --> 58:01.716
You raised me better than that,
right?

58:01.749 --> 58:02.817
I mean, don't get me wrong.

58:02.850 --> 58:04.051
There's a lot going on

58:04.085 --> 58:06.620
for an old guy like you to try
to conquer.

58:06.654 --> 58:07.955
You're still a sharpshooter,

58:07.989 --> 58:09.991
and it's what this town needs
right now.

58:12.560 --> 58:13.227
Hmm.

58:16.564 --> 58:19.100
Well, I'll drink to that.

58:20.634 --> 58:23.804
That's what I'm talking about.

59:13.187 --> 59:14.021
Boo!

59:15.956 --> 59:17.358
You fucking asshole!

59:17.391 --> 59:19.326
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

59:19.360 --> 59:20.261
Are you okay?

59:20.294 --> 59:21.128
No.

59:21.162 --> 59:22.363
Way to go, Jer!

59:22.396 --> 59:24.999
You jumped out in front of
me. What was I supposed to do?

59:25.032 --> 59:27.735
Hey, there's only one thing
that'll make this better.

59:27.768 --> 59:28.969
- What?
- What?

59:29.003 --> 59:31.338
Never come to a party
empty handed!

59:32.640 --> 59:33.774
Seriously, Amanda?

59:33.808 --> 59:34.775
Oh, relax, Jer.

59:34.809 --> 59:35.743
Come on, let's go.

59:36.410 --> 59:39.180
Woo hoo hoo!

59:43.518 --> 59:45.152
Do you remember that one
summer

59:45.186 --> 59:47.254
when we sent you away for camp?

59:47.288 --> 59:48.322
Not really, why?

59:51.158 --> 59:53.861
Well, I don't think your
mom and I ever told you this.

59:55.062 --> 59:55.896
We sent you away because we
wanted you

59:55.930 --> 59:57.965
to have some structure in your
life.

59:58.766 --> 1:00:01.235
And you were a pretty big
asshole

1:00:01.268 --> 1:00:02.837
when you were a little kid.

1:00:03.671 --> 1:00:05.806
Some things
never change, right?

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:08.008
Yeah, you know,

1:00:08.042 --> 1:00:09.944
we thought we had it all figured
out.

1:00:12.847 --> 1:00:13.948
Send you away for a couple of
weeks.

1:00:13.981 --> 1:00:15.749
Enjoy the peace and quiet.

1:00:15.783 --> 1:00:17.918
Thought everything would turn
out great.

1:00:17.952 --> 1:00:18.786
And did it?

1:00:19.753 --> 1:00:21.222
No, no, Dave, it didn't.

1:00:22.223 --> 1:00:26.293
You see, ah, we thought
we had it all figured out,

1:00:28.195 --> 1:00:29.697
but your little brother,

1:00:29.730 --> 1:00:31.432
he was destroyed when you
weren't there.

1:00:31.465 --> 1:00:33.701
Really?

1:00:33.734 --> 1:00:36.437
He would just sit, look
out the window for hours

1:00:36.470 --> 1:00:38.772
just waiting for you to come
home.

1:00:38.806 --> 1:00:39.807
We'd tell him,

1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:43.210
"Go on out, go play,
have some fun, be a kid."

1:00:44.145 --> 1:00:44.945
He wouldn't do it.

1:00:44.979 --> 1:00:46.947
He just sat there waiting for
you.

1:00:48.749 --> 1:00:50.985
I know the bond between
brothers can be special.

1:00:52.219 --> 1:00:54.355
It was like you two were
connected,

1:00:54.388 --> 1:00:57.258
because when you weren't
there, part of him was missing.

1:00:59.793 --> 1:01:01.162
Why are you telling me this?

1:01:11.272 --> 1:01:16.277
You know, it's not easy for
me to admit that I'm wrong.

1:01:16.744 --> 1:01:18.779
Dad, it was just camp.

1:01:20.347 --> 1:01:21.916
I'm not talking about camp.

1:01:23.417 --> 1:01:25.152
You know, parents do all
sorts of strange things

1:01:25.186 --> 1:01:27.054
to ah, protect their kids,

1:01:28.489 --> 1:01:31.125
and I've been keeping
things from you around here.

1:01:31.158 --> 1:01:33.160
I've been doing it for your own
good.

1:01:33.194 --> 1:01:34.228
Like what?

1:01:34.261 --> 1:01:38.432
Well, nothing major, but
ah, some little things.

1:01:38.465 --> 1:01:41.402
But those little things
can add up to big things,

1:01:41.435 --> 1:01:43.938
especially for the cases
that we're working on.

1:01:44.705 --> 1:01:46.508
I guess what I'm trying to say
is

1:01:46.541 --> 1:01:49.276
time for me to take off
the training wheels,

1:01:50.110 --> 1:01:52.146
because I can't protect you
forever.

1:02:00.454 --> 1:02:02.790
I think I just need to
get out of your way,

1:02:04.858 --> 1:02:06.026
and let you do your job.

1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:16.070
I've never heard you
talk like this before.

1:02:16.103 --> 1:02:17.871
To be honest,

1:02:17.905 --> 1:02:19.940
I had no idea you had it in you.

1:02:20.709 --> 1:02:25.513
Well, don't get
used to it,

1:02:27.414 --> 1:02:31.785
because tomorrow I'm never
gonna be wrong again.

1:02:50.104 --> 1:02:52.239
Ugh, guys, I just don't
understand

1:02:52.273 --> 1:02:54.408
why we are being punished
with this curfew.

1:02:55.476 --> 1:02:58.145
Like, it's our civil right to go
out.

1:02:58.178 --> 1:02:59.213
This is an injustice.

1:02:59.246 --> 1:03:00.781
That's exactly what this is.

1:03:01.882 --> 1:03:03.117
You know I don't drink.

1:03:03.150 --> 1:03:05.119
Come on.

1:03:05.152 --> 1:03:06.854
Yeah, don't be such a puss,
Jer.

1:03:06.887 --> 1:03:07.689
Give me that.

1:03:07.722 --> 1:03:10.924
Bitches, please, I have my
vices.

1:03:10.958 --> 1:03:13.127
They just happen to be
different than yours.

1:03:14.128 --> 1:03:16.531
You mean trashier than ours.

1:03:19.333 --> 1:03:20.968
The irony, my sweet tart.

1:03:23.270 --> 1:03:26.006
Jess, help me up, bitches!

1:03:26.741 --> 1:03:28.142
Guys, shut up for a second.

1:03:28.175 --> 1:03:29.376
No, you shut it.

1:03:29.410 --> 1:03:30.844
No, guys, seriously, shut the
fuck up!

1:03:30.878 --> 1:03:33.347
I think I just saw
something move behind you.

1:03:34.915 --> 1:03:35.550
What?

1:03:43.991 --> 1:03:45.392
Do you see anything?

1:03:45.426 --> 1:03:47.428
Guys, what it is?

1:04:15.623 --> 1:04:16.490
Come on!

1:04:21.161 --> 1:04:24.298
Come on, come on, where is
everybody?

1:04:38.145 --> 1:04:39.012
No!

1:05:37.505 --> 1:05:38.439
Dad?

1:05:38.472 --> 1:05:40.140
Maggie, go back.

1:05:46.079 --> 1:05:47.981
No, I'm, I'm not gonna leave
you.

1:05:48.015 --> 1:05:49.316
Maggie, go!

1:05:53.454 --> 1:05:54.589
Oh, oh, Dad!

1:07:20.842 --> 1:07:21.776
Todd!

1:07:22.476 --> 1:07:24.077
Todd, wake up, it's Maggie!

1:07:26.514 --> 1:07:27.582
I'm up.

1:07:27.615 --> 1:07:29.249
I need to show you
something. Look at these shots.

1:07:30.417 --> 1:07:31.418
What does that mean?

1:07:32.486 --> 1:07:34.488
- Where did you get this?
- That's Dad's camera?

1:07:34.522 --> 1:07:36.624
I found the card hidden in the
book.

1:07:36.658 --> 1:07:39.661
Look, why does my father have
a picture of Connor in Alaska?

1:07:40.762 --> 1:07:42.362
Is it possible?

1:07:42.396 --> 1:07:43.363
What, what do you mean?

1:07:43.397 --> 1:07:45.432
Well, the last time I
talked with your father,

1:07:45.465 --> 1:07:47.301
he was tracking a lead on a
werewolf.

1:07:47.334 --> 1:07:49.537
He was suspicious of a young man
in town.

1:07:49.571 --> 1:07:52.205
Good looking kid, had
a scar on his shoulder.

1:07:52.239 --> 1:07:54.842
Connor's always rubbing his
shoulder like he injured it.

1:07:54.876 --> 1:07:57.177
I thought there was something
about him.

1:07:57.210 --> 1:07:58.846
So, what do we do?

1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:01.883
Look, Maggie, I promised
your father I'd keep you safe,

1:08:01.916 --> 1:08:04.484
so we aren't going to do
anything tonight.

1:08:05.352 --> 1:08:07.454
Stay in your room, lock the
door,

1:08:07.487 --> 1:08:09.489
and don't go anywhere, okay?

1:08:09.524 --> 1:08:11.258
Todd, he might know about my
parents.

1:08:11.291 --> 1:08:13.126
I can't just sit here and wait.

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:14.529
You have to.

1:08:14.562 --> 1:08:15.697
I tried to warn your parents.

1:08:15.730 --> 1:08:17.297
They didn't listen to me.

1:08:17.331 --> 1:08:19.534
I'm not gonna let this happen
again.

1:08:21.936 --> 1:08:23.403
Fine.

1:09:34.374 --> 1:09:37.512
Look, Maggie, I promised
your father I'd keep you safe,

1:09:37.545 --> 1:09:39.514
so we aren't gonna do anything
tonight.

1:09:47.487 --> 1:09:48.623
Oh, God.

1:10:19.821 --> 1:10:22.422
Shit.

1:11:06.366 --> 1:11:07.367
You're not in this alone,
okay?

1:11:07.400 --> 1:11:08.569
I was there for your parents.

1:11:08.603 --> 1:11:10.337
I'll be there for you.

1:11:10.370 --> 1:11:11.506
I know, Todd.

1:11:11.539 --> 1:11:14.407
Don't mess with that, I mean
seriously, you're family.

1:11:56.884 --> 1:11:59.787
Fuck this, I can't wait anymore.

1:12:05.793 --> 1:12:07.662
Todd, it's time to go!

1:12:11.098 --> 1:12:11.999
Todd, get up!

1:12:18.005 --> 1:12:18.873
Todd?

1:12:22.176 --> 1:12:23.778
Shit.

1:12:37.058 --> 1:12:38.391
Oh good, you're here.

1:12:39.861 --> 1:12:41.394
Didn't you go home last night?

1:12:41.428 --> 1:12:42.830
No, sir.

1:12:42.864 --> 1:12:43.698
Well, get yourself together.

1:12:43.731 --> 1:12:45.967
We've got another dead body in
town.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.101
Shit.

1:12:47.134 --> 1:12:49.904
Come on, we better get
going. I need you on the scene.

1:12:49.937 --> 1:12:51.105
Where's your partner?

1:12:51.138 --> 1:12:52.874
Don't know, sir.

1:12:52.907 --> 1:12:54.642
All right, well, let's
go. I'll fill him in later.

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:22.069
Hello, anyone here, hello?

1:13:26.974 --> 1:13:28.643
Sorry, it's been crazy around
here.

1:13:28.676 --> 1:13:29.476
How can I help?

1:13:29.510 --> 1:13:30.778
I'm looking for Detective
Ryan.

1:13:30.811 --> 1:13:31.879
He just left.

1:13:31.913 --> 1:13:32.747
Can I leave a message?

1:13:32.780 --> 1:13:34.081
Shit, no, no message.

1:13:34.115 --> 1:13:35.149
Where did he go?

1:13:35.182 --> 1:13:36.851
I'm sorry, I can't give
you that information.

1:13:36.884 --> 1:13:37.919
Seriously?

1:13:37.952 --> 1:13:40.855
I've been working with
him on this investigation.

1:13:40.888 --> 1:13:41.856
What did you say your name
was?

1:13:41.889 --> 1:13:43.057
Maggie, Maggie Talbot.

1:13:43.090 --> 1:13:45.425
Please, I really need to talk
to him. This is important.

1:13:46.594 --> 1:13:47.561
Okay, let me try.

1:13:50.197 --> 1:13:51.666
10-100 to 10-04.

1:13:54.568 --> 1:13:55.836
10-100 to 10-04.

1:14:00.241 --> 1:14:01.709
10-100 to 10-04.

1:14:04.245 --> 1:14:05.680
10-100 to 10-04.

1:14:08.115 --> 1:14:09.617
I'm sorry, he's not responding.

1:14:09.650 --> 1:14:11.018
Great, just great.

1:14:35.009 --> 1:14:36.744
Where are you, Todd?

1:14:38.145 --> 1:14:38.946
I had a vision.

1:14:38.980 --> 1:14:41.515
I told your dad don't go on this
one.

1:14:41.549 --> 1:14:42.550
I got a bad feeling.

1:14:44.685 --> 1:14:45.953
Are they dead?

1:14:45.987 --> 1:14:47.722
I don't know, Mags.

1:15:08.009 --> 1:15:09.744
Jesus Christ.

1:16:05.633 --> 1:16:06.333
Stop, sorry, ma'am.

1:16:06.367 --> 1:16:07.201
You can't go any farther.

1:16:07.234 --> 1:16:08.069
I need to find Detective Ryan,
please!

1:16:08.102 --> 1:16:10.104
I'm sorry, you can't go any
farther.

1:16:10.137 --> 1:16:11.906
This is really important.

1:16:11.939 --> 1:16:12.973
He went that way.

1:17:07.995 --> 1:17:10.097
No, God, no, shit!

1:17:29.216 --> 1:17:31.886
You know the old man's
got bourbon in his office?

1:17:34.788 --> 1:17:38.359
No, serious, me and him
had a moment last night.

1:18:06.187 --> 1:18:08.322
Maggie, what are you doing
here?

1:18:14.395 --> 1:18:16.964
It was you all this time?

1:18:16.997 --> 1:18:19.400
No, Maggie, no, it wasn't me.

1:18:24.171 --> 1:18:26.073
Jesus, you look like hell.

1:18:27.041 --> 1:18:28.742
Where's my brother?

1:18:36.217 --> 1:18:38.852
Maggie, just relax.

1:18:38.886 --> 1:18:40.387
Put the gun down!

1:18:40.421 --> 1:18:42.856
Matt, relax, Connor went out
on a case.

1:18:42.890 --> 1:18:44.291
He'll be back in just a little
bit.

1:18:45.527 --> 1:18:47.261
Is there something I can help
you this?

1:18:47.294 --> 1:18:49.997
Nobody can help me.

1:18:51.999 --> 1:18:53.300
You need to go get my dad.

1:18:59.139 --> 1:19:03.310
Maggie, whatever you're
thinking, it isn't true, okay?

1:19:04.245 --> 1:19:05.746
You killed them.

1:19:06.548 --> 1:19:07.948
I know that it was you!

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:14.054
You took everything from
me , my parents!

1:19:14.088 --> 1:19:15.456
No, no, Maggie.

1:19:16.123 --> 1:19:19.126
You can't just sit there
and lie to me!

1:19:19.159 --> 1:19:22.930
Maggie, look, it's me, it's
Connor.

1:19:24.198 --> 1:19:27.234
No.

1:19:28.135 --> 1:19:29.069
Chief, we need you.

1:19:29.103 --> 1:19:30.271
Connor's brother's here.

1:19:30.304 --> 1:19:31.805
Something's not right.

1:19:37.512 --> 1:19:38.879
Matt, what's going on?

1:19:41.148 --> 1:19:43.183
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let him go
now!

1:19:46.186 --> 1:19:49.256
Look, Maggie, I know
you're scared, okay,

1:19:49.290 --> 1:19:50.124
but this isn't you.

1:19:50.157 --> 1:19:52.527
You don't know anything!

1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:55.329
You can't, it's just too much.

1:19:55.362 --> 1:19:57.164
You're the strongest person I
know.

1:19:57.898 --> 1:20:00.200
But you gotta think about
what you're doing here.

1:20:00.234 --> 1:20:01.502
Drop your weapon.

1:20:01.536 --> 1:20:04.238
I can't, it has to be this
way.

1:20:04.271 --> 1:20:05.507
No, it doesn't!

1:20:05.540 --> 1:20:07.308
You don't have to do this!

1:20:07.341 --> 1:20:08.510
Yes, I do!

1:20:08.543 --> 1:20:10.878
It's the only thing I can do!

1:20:10.911 --> 1:20:13.247
Damn it, trust me!

1:20:13.280 --> 1:20:14.848
I can help you!

1:20:14.882 --> 1:20:16.183
It's too late for that!

1:20:16.216 --> 1:20:18.886
It's too late for me, I've
tried!

1:20:22.456 --> 1:20:23.558
Everything I've done!

1:20:27.995 --> 1:20:33.000
Everywhere I've gone, it stays
with me!

1:20:39.006 --> 1:20:40.508
It's better this way.

1:20:42.409 --> 1:20:45.580
I beg of you, don't do this,
please.

1:20:55.989 --> 1:20:56.624
No!

1:21:15.577 --> 1:21:18.912
I'm sorry.

1:21:38.399 --> 1:21:42.469
I know there's a special
bond between brothers.

1:21:43.437 --> 1:21:46.373
It's like you guys are
connected in some way.

1:21:46.407 --> 1:21:48.576
It's okay, get up.

1:21:48.610 --> 1:21:51.979
And part of him was missing
when you weren't there.

1:21:52.012 --> 1:21:57.017
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

1:22:01.355 --> 1:22:03.290
It's okay, it's okay.

1:22:05.092 --> 1:22:07.161
Everything's gonna be fine.

1:22:20.307 --> 1:22:21.208
Family and friends,

1:22:21.241 --> 1:22:23.578
we thank you for allowing us
this honor.

1:22:24.344 --> 1:22:27.549
We, the members of this Honor
Guard assembled here today

1:22:27.582 --> 1:22:29.651
didn't personally know Matt
Ryan,

1:22:29.684 --> 1:22:32.687
but we do recognize him
as a comrade in arms.

1:22:37.157 --> 1:22:41.228
Honor Guard, 10-hut, port
arms!

1:22:41.261 --> 1:22:44.264
We understand his commitment
and service to his country

1:22:44.298 --> 1:22:45.667
as a member of the Marines

1:22:45.700 --> 1:22:48.469
during tours of duty in
Afghanistan.

1:22:48.502 --> 1:22:51.038
Ready, aim, fire!

1:22:52.072 --> 1:22:54.041
We know the loneliness,
fatigue, boredom,

1:22:54.074 --> 1:22:56.176
and terror of combat service.

1:22:56.210 --> 1:22:57.545
Aim, fire!

1:22:58.513 --> 1:22:59.781
When the call of our country
was heard

1:22:59.814 --> 1:23:01.482
Comrade Ryan answered.

1:23:01.516 --> 1:23:04.552
Self was forgotten in the
cause of greater good.

1:23:04.586 --> 1:23:05.587
Aim, fire!

1:23:06.487 --> 1:23:08.355
When someone you love is so
valued,

1:23:08.388 --> 1:23:10.190
a memory is the byproduct.

1:23:10.224 --> 1:23:12.660
That memory surely becomes a
treasure.

1:23:12.694 --> 1:23:16.363
Let us now remember what this
soldier's life was and is.

1:23:19.601 --> 1:23:21.536
On behalf of the
United States of America,

1:23:21.569 --> 1:23:24.104
United States Marine Corps,
and a grateful nation,

1:23:24.137 --> 1:23:25.773
we present this to you in behalf

1:23:25.807 --> 1:23:29.009
of your sibling's great
honorable service to his country.

1:25:33.901 --> 1:25:36.804
Connor , hi, it's
been awhile.

1:25:39.239 --> 1:25:41.174
Is everything all right?

1:25:45.445 --> 1:25:46.848
Wait, what?

1:25:51.753 --> 1:25:52.654
Copy that.
