02:07.335 --> 02:10.628
Conductor didn't wanna play.
How's this guy?

02:10.839 --> 02:11.922
Nice and willing.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.258
Stop the train and let us off.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.802
When we tell you.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.563
Ed, Cotton, when we get the train
on the spur, start hopping. Go.

02:27.772 --> 02:31.233
- Zuckie, you know what to do?
- Sure. I throw the switch and beat it back...

02:31.442 --> 02:33.277
All right, just do it. Stop the gabbing.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.511
All right. This is where we want off.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.164
Stop it right here.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.464
Get away from those controls.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.257
What's this, a holdup?

03:37.467 --> 03:42.262
No, no. You're seven minutes late.
We're just changing engineers.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.723
A lot fancier than my old coal burner
on the C&O.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.725
Shut up!

04:06.162 --> 04:07.913
Open up and you won't get hurt.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.167
Sounds bad, Cody.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.337
Why don't you give him my address too?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.682
Only the Treasury stuff!

04:32.563 --> 04:35.565
Hurry up, boys. Get in there.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.778
- You won't get away with it, Cody.
- Cody, huh?

04:40.488 --> 04:42.614
- Go get the car started.
- You got it.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.574
You've got a good memory for names.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.619
Too good.

05:10.977 --> 05:13.103
Zuckie got scalded.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.273
Come on, let's get out of here.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.112
A week has passed
since bandits jumped a mail train...

05:22.280 --> 05:24.197
...coming out of the High Sierra Tunnel...

05:24.407 --> 05:28.660
...and fled with $300,000
in federal currency, leaving four dead.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.912
Treasury authorities now believe...

05:31.080 --> 05:32.748
...that the gang has escaped to Arizona...

05:32.915 --> 05:35.500
...where today a bank was raided
and two tellers killed...

05:35.710 --> 05:38.295
...with the same cold-bloodedness
that characterized...

05:38.504 --> 05:40.255
Now we're supposed to be in Arizona.

05:40.465 --> 05:43.091
Any place would be better than this.

05:44.635 --> 05:45.844
We gotta blow out of here.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.305
Cody calls charging roadblocks
unscientific.

05:48.514 --> 05:52.059
It ain't safe having a crackpot giving orders.
About time somebody took over.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.187
- Who, for instance?
- A very good friend of mine, me.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.856
Where do you want the body sent?

06:05.698 --> 06:06.907
Been golfing, Ed?

06:09.077 --> 06:12.788
We got a sack full of dough and we're
holed up here like a bunch of gophers.

06:12.997 --> 06:14.790
When we moving out?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.876
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe in the spring.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.170
I'll give it a lot of thought.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.047
All right?

06:28.679 --> 06:29.805
Mm.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.808
Smells good, Ma.

06:33.017 --> 06:37.312
If you're getting hungry,
I could do with some help, son.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.198
Verna.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.659
Help Ma with the groceries.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.288
Verna.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.303
Well, if it ain't the sleeping beauty.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.681
What else does a girl do
around this bear trap?

07:12.890 --> 07:15.600
There's plenty you can do
without wearing out the mattress.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.644
It's the only place I don't freeze.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.439
I've been cold for a week, Cody.
Not even a fire.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.483
Who's gonna see a little bit of smoke
a hundred miles from nowhere?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.820
- Help Ma with the grub.
- Cody.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.115
He's getting worse. He needs a doc.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.954
When the time comes.

07:37.081 --> 07:39.624
- Want some coffee, Ed?
- Thanks, Verna.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.127
Let him get it himself.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.254
My wife don't wait on nobody.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.051
You know something, Verna?

07:50.261 --> 07:53.138
If I turned my back long enough
for Big Ed to put a hole in it...

07:53.347 --> 07:54.890
...there'd be a hole in it.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.855
Big Ed. Great Big Ed. Heh.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.732
Know why they call him that?

08:03.941 --> 08:06.109
Because his ideas are big.

08:06.444 --> 08:10.572
Someday he's gonna get a really big one
about me.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.908
And it'll be his last.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.602
That's the second one
he's had in a month.

08:40.811 --> 08:42.938
He's nuts, just like his old man.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.995
It's these mountains, Cody.

08:59.205 --> 09:03.041
It's not good for you, cold all the time.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.211
You can't breathe the air.

09:06.837 --> 09:09.172
Let's get out, son.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.347
It's going. It's going.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.983
- It's going?
- Yeah.

09:28.192 --> 09:30.443
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.195
It's like having a...

09:32.822 --> 09:36.449
It's like having a red-hot buzz saw
inside my head.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.916
- No. No, not yet, son.
- Hmm?

09:45.126 --> 09:49.296
Don't let them see you like that.
Might give some of them ideas.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.594
Yeah.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.513
Always thinking about your Cody,
aren't you?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.599
That's right.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.868
Top of the world, son.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.621
Don't know what I'd do without you, Ma.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.459
Mm.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.461
- Better?
- Mm.

10:29.629 --> 10:34.215
- Yeah.
- Now go on out. Show them you're all right.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.188
What are you all gaping at?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.982
And I thought I told you
to help Ma with the groceries.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.402
Cody. Hey, Cody.
There's a storm coming.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.446
Every road's gonna be blocked,
the guy said.

10:56.614 --> 10:57.864
What guy?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.825
- On the radio.
- How long did he give it?

11:01.035 --> 11:04.162
- Tonight.
- Oh. That's just what I've been waiting for.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.873
- Is everything packed?
- We've been packed for a week.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.375
You sure it's safe, Cody?

11:08.584 --> 11:10.168
A storm keeps everybody busy.

11:10.378 --> 11:14.923
Now, clean up this place, and clean it
up right. And don't leave any calling cards.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.469
I told you to keep away from that radio.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.515
If that battery is dead, it'll have company.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.689
It's your suitcase, Cody.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.149
Why don't you keep it all?

11:35.611 --> 11:38.863
You're cute. Come here.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.160
Why don't you?

11:44.370 --> 11:47.789
We could travel, buy things.

11:48.082 --> 11:51.000
- That's what money's for.
- Hmm.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.713
- I look good in a mink coat, honey.
- Mm-hm.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.091
You'd look good in a shower curtain.

12:05.474 --> 12:06.641
We're pals, Cotton.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.769
You'll see that I get away all right,
see that I get to a doc?

12:09.979 --> 12:11.771
Sure, sure, Zuckie.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.565
All set.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.483
- Cody?
- Yeah?

12:15.693 --> 12:18.111
I was pretty good back there on the train,
huh, Cody?

12:18.320 --> 12:20.864
- Pretty good for my first job, huh?
- Yeah, you were great.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.825
You won't leave me here.
You'll take me with you?

12:24.034 --> 12:26.578
We can't take any chance
of being picked up with you in the car.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.122
We'll send a doc right away.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.125
You're gonna let me die.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.841
Cotton?

12:40.050 --> 12:43.094
Cotton, don't leave me.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.060
Suppose they find him, Cody?
You know how Zuckie talks.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.646
He won't talk. Cotton.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.857
You meant what you said
about sending a doc?

12:56.066 --> 13:00.028
Yeah, sure. A specialist. You.

13:00.988 --> 13:04.949
Here, if you're such a pal of his,
go back and make it easy for him.

13:06.869 --> 13:07.911
Go.

13:11.832 --> 13:16.002
Rest easy, Ma. We're 300 miles
from the tunnel. What have they got?

13:16.212 --> 13:17.545
A corpse without a record.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.089
Nothing to tie him in
with the tunnel job or us.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.388
Don't make a sound, Zuckie.
It's me, Cotton.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.766
Look, I'll try to come back.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.268
- Here's some cigarettes, huh?
- Thanks, Cotton.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.853
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

13:53.749 --> 13:58.002
Ed, we'll separate. Go east until you hit the
highway and double back over the bridge.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.381
Stay on dirt roads all the way. You hear?

14:27.116 --> 14:30.034
Hope I didn't get you up here
on a wild-goose chase, Mr. Evans.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.078
Geese we're looking for are pretty wild.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.081
A couple of hunters found him frozen
up in the mountains.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.751
We started wondering. Stranger, bullet hole
in the roof of the cabin...

14:38.961 --> 14:41.629
...particularly the condition of his face.
Tell him, doc.

14:41.839 --> 14:45.550
Despite the third-degree burn, the eyebrows
and hairline weren't even singed.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.969
That means either boiling water or steam.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.096
So we thought of a steam engine.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.682
Hmm, good hunch. Get me his clothes.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.183
Ernie.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.312
Get his fingerprints
and take a mask of his face.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.730
Here you are, Mr. Evans.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.649
Nothing in the pockets
but this pack of cigarettes.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.878
So like you told me, Mr. Evans,
I made the rounds for a month.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.297
Drifting, kind of. Not too eager.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.300
You know, just dropping a word
in the right ear...

15:27.509 --> 15:30.470
...that I'm interested in picking up
a few odd dollars.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.014
Not a buck from the tunnel job
showed up.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.434
They haven't buried it in tin cans, Willie.
Keep looking.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.353
Okay.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.397
I'll go out the back way,
if you don't mind.

15:41.607 --> 15:45.610
If any of the boys spotted me
coming up here, I'd be in a real jam.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.238
- Did you get anything out of Willie?
- A blank.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.533
This will cheer you up, Phil.
Spectrograph of dirt from the tunnel.

15:52.743 --> 15:55.912
Spectrograph of dust deposits
taken from the dead man's clothes.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.830
No doubt about it. They're identical.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.793
It all adds up and places our friend in the
morgue right at the scene of the crime.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.003
Oh, looks like we're in business.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.094
From Washington.

16:11.303 --> 16:15.473
"Have no fingerprint record, dead man."

16:15.683 --> 16:19.811
Well, that's one I never expected.
Dead man, dead end.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.314
"But prints on cellophane
of cigarette package...

16:23.524 --> 16:27.443
...belong Giovanni 'Cotton' Valetti.

16:27.653 --> 16:30.113
Known member, Jarrett Gang."

16:32.658 --> 16:35.451
And I thought
you were never gonna talk, baby.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.721
- Where's Ma?
- She went to the market.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.265
- Which one?
- She don't tell me those details.

17:39.475 --> 17:40.975
What difference does it make?

17:41.185 --> 17:44.854
I'll tell you what difference it makes.
They've got Zuckie in a morgue upstate.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.732
- T-men tied him in with us on the tunnel job.
- What?

17:47.941 --> 17:50.193
Yeah. We're all as hot as pistols.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.279
I don't know how they did it.
Somebody must have tipped them.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.949
It's always "somebody tipped them,"
never "the cops are smart."

17:57.159 --> 17:59.994
We had enough food for a week.
What'd she have to go out for?

18:00.204 --> 18:04.373
You like strawberries, don't you?
Well, she just had to get some for her boy.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.571
Evans speaking.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.201
Her car is parked outside pointing west.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.453
Good. I'll be down there right away.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.373
Now, there'll be a marker
on the rear bumper.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.292
Mm-hm, that's what I thought, Mr. Evans.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.129
Where Ma goes, Cody goes.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.122
We'll use the ABC method.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.540
I'm B.

19:27.749 --> 19:32.170
I'll keep first position behind suspect
on Arango Boulevard.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.713
Two-two-seven, you're A.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.883
You drive parallel on Lattimer.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.092
Okay.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.346
Three-two-three, you're C.
The same on Fairchild.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.599
- Got that?
- Okay.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.171
Suspect proceeding dead ahead
on Arango Boulevard.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.881
Approaching Bakeman.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.681
Suspect turned north on Bakeman.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.354
C, pick her up at Fairchild.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.731
A will take your position.

20:40.280 --> 20:44.533
Got her. Traveling dead ahead
on Bakeman, 20 miles an hour.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.162
Suspect turning west on Calhoun.

20:49.790 --> 20:52.083
C, proceed dead ahead.

20:52.292 --> 20:54.877
- Take position on the right.
- Right.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.504
A...

20:57.089 --> 21:00.299
- ...pick her up on Calhoun.
- Roger.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.606
Got her.
Going due west about 30 miles per hour.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.857
Hold the phone.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.820
She's turning left on Cling.

21:22.572 --> 21:27.034
Let her go. C, cut over fast to Arango.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.578
- Cover her on the left.
- Okay.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.540
A, proceed dead ahead.

21:32.749 --> 21:37.295
I'll pick her up
when she crosses Fairchild.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.517
Get around it.

21:59.443 --> 22:02.028
A, C, cut into Fairchild. I've lost her.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.821
Down there.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.169
- Come in, C.
- That's a dead spot, Phil.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.546
It would be. Turn around. We'll go back.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.685
Hold it.

22:45.447 --> 22:47.281
Come in, A.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.034
Come in, C.

22:51.161 --> 22:52.870
Beat it up the hill and call the others.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.624
- You're not gonna tackle him alone.
- I'll just keep an eye on him. Hurry.

23:01.671 --> 23:05.800
What's the use of having money if you gotta
run every time somebody sees a shadow?

23:06.009 --> 23:09.261
It's just a feeling I had, Cody.
I could have been wrong.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.056
Your hunches are never wrong, Ma.
We'll leave the sedan.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.724
That's the car they're looking for.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.394
You bring the bags and I'll get the coupe.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.155
You're not going anywhere, Jarrett.
Put your hands up where I can see them.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.583
Get those bags in and get in fast.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.901
Down the highway, Ernie.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.687
Happens every night. Ruins the movie.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.533
Peanuts? Popcorn?

25:35.951 --> 25:37.326
Peanuts. Popcorn.

25:40.997 --> 25:43.040
Kill that.

25:45.877 --> 25:49.046
This is great.
Where do we go after the second feature?

25:49.256 --> 25:52.132
You're staying put.
I'm the only one going anyplace.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.385
- Where, Cody?
- Gonna give myself up.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.763
What are you talking about?
You haven't a chance.

25:57.973 --> 26:01.183
Four dead. It's the gas chamber for sure.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.811
You think I'm dumb enough
to give myself up to the T-men?

26:04.020 --> 26:07.314
What's the difference? You walk
into the cops and they turn you over.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.191
Remember a guy named Scratch Morton?

26:09.901 --> 26:13.445
Yeah. Little guy on the lam from Illinois.
You had a talk with him one night.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.906
- That's the one.
- I remember, Cody.

26:16.116 --> 26:19.201
Knocked over a hotel payroll
in Springfield?

26:19.411 --> 26:21.161
- The night we pulled the tunnel job.
- Uh-huh.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.663
Handy, huh?

26:22.872 --> 26:24.248
Talk plain, son.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.918
I pulled that Springfield heist,
not Scratch Morton.

26:28.128 --> 26:31.755
I'm going up to Illinois and take a state rap.
I'll get two years at the most.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.633
When you get out,
they'll be waiting for you for the tunnel job.

26:34.843 --> 26:39.305
What tunnel job? While those hoodlums
were killing innocent people on the train...

26:39.514 --> 26:42.057
...I was pushing in a hotel in Springfield.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.435
Couldn't be in both places
at once, could I?

26:44.978 --> 26:47.688
Little thing I cooked up
before we pulled the tunnel job.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.774
You're the smartest there is, Cody.

26:50.984 --> 26:54.778
Sure, it's smart, but what about me?
What do I do for the next two years?

26:54.988 --> 26:56.947
The same as you did
before he married you.

26:58.825 --> 27:01.243
You'd better not, baby. I'll be back.

27:01.661 --> 27:04.330
I'll be waiting for you, honey.
You can trust me.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.626
If the T-men pick you up, you don't know
a thing, haven't seen me in months.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.044
Ma, you do all the talking.

27:10.253 --> 27:15.132
- I can handle them.
- Verna, you cry a little, like you're sad.

27:17.093 --> 27:20.846
- How you gonna make it to Illinois?
- Private plane. Don't worry.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.890
Here, Ma.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.642
Goodbye.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.562
Be kind of a break
to get rid of me for a while, won't it?

27:29.522 --> 27:32.024
I'll be around, Cody.

27:38.239 --> 27:41.367
I told you,
I was just trying to cheer up Verna.

27:41.576 --> 27:44.912
She's been lonesome all this time,
missing Cody so much.

27:45.121 --> 27:48.499
So I went to the market
to buy her things for a real spread.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.877
Thought it'd make her feel better.
That so, Verna?

27:52.087 --> 27:55.839
Yet as soon as you returned
to the auto court, you left again. Why?

27:56.049 --> 27:58.926
Because we decided to go
to a movie instead.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.804
- What theater?
- San Val Drive-In.

28:02.013 --> 28:04.640
- What picture?
- Task Force.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.601
Exciting. Verna liked it a lot.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.103
Cody like it?

28:09.604 --> 28:10.938
How could he?

28:11.147 --> 28:14.358
I told you,
Cody hasn't been in California for months.

28:14.567 --> 28:18.070
Heh, I suppose he shot me
all the way from another state.

28:18.279 --> 28:21.907
What makes you think he shot you?
Lots of people have guns.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.368
I was as close to him as I am to you.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.829
Anybody else see him?

28:27.247 --> 28:30.833
Just you. And his wife.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.878
Of course, being an old woman,
I wouldn't know much about the law...

28:35.088 --> 28:40.050
...but I hear you got to have witnesses
to make anything stand up in court.

28:41.803 --> 28:45.097
You see Cody last night, Verna?

28:45.807 --> 28:48.600
Makes you the only one,
Mr. Evans, doesn't it?

28:48.810 --> 28:51.395
Seems to. If Cody's been out of California
for months...

28:51.604 --> 28:55.649
...I suppose he couldn't possibly have
engineered that train robbery six weeks ago.

28:55.859 --> 29:00.821
Mr. Evans, I'm not going to sit here
and hear you accuse my boy without proof.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.825
Besides, I know my rights.
You can't keep us here.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.493
You got nothing on us.

29:06.703 --> 29:09.371
All right, Mrs. Jarrett. That'll be all now.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.039
That's better.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.666
Come on, Verna.

29:12.876 --> 29:16.879
Stop crying. Nobody's going to hurt you.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.946
Mr. Fallon just arrived from the airport.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.698
Send him right in.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.368
Hello, Phil. How's the arm?

29:48.578 --> 29:51.163
- I'll live. Hey, you're looking good.
- Yeah? Heh.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.458
It's that prison diet. Great chef
in San Quentin. I hated to leave.

29:54.667 --> 29:55.751
You did a whale of a job.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.587
Ah, most talkative little con
I ever shared a cell with.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.507
That whole syndicate comes up for trial
in a few weeks.

30:01.716 --> 30:03.509
Now, what's that?

30:04.052 --> 30:06.887
You put it on a pole,
wind a spool of silk thread around it...

30:07.096 --> 30:08.931
...and you hold the pole over the water.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.683
Then you sit under a nice shady tree
and relax.

30:11.893 --> 30:15.103
After a while, a hungry fish comes along,
takes a nip at your hook...

30:15.271 --> 30:16.313
...and you've got dinner.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.358
For the next two weeks,
I'm not gonna think about anything...

30:19.567 --> 30:21.944
...except the eternal struggle
between man and fish.

30:22.237 --> 30:25.447
I've been promised a vacation.
You remember?

30:26.282 --> 30:27.491
Sorry, Hank, that's out.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.871
Phil, look at me.
College degree, lovable personality...

30:33.081 --> 30:34.998
...and I spend most of my time in prison.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.793
An undercover specialist.
Eight sentences in five years.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.003
Dannemora, Sing Sing, Leavenworth.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.714
I joined the department
to put criminals behind bars...

30:42.924 --> 30:45.342
...and here I am, stir-crazy.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.638
Read this.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.984
Who checks confessions in Springfield?

31:02.193 --> 31:05.696
Every rookie knows Scratch Morton
went underground after that hotel job.

31:05.905 --> 31:08.740
You're not gonna let Jarrett get away
with a two-bit prison stretch?

31:08.950 --> 31:10.909
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

31:11.119 --> 31:15.080
A hoodlum turns himself in on a phony rap
and beats the gas chamber, heh.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.375
I'll bet he's thumbing his nose
at Uncle Sam right now and loving it.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.668
Jarrett outsmarted you.

31:19.878 --> 31:23.881
That's just what we want him to think.
We're working with the Springfield police.

31:24.090 --> 31:27.217
We arranged for the confession to check.
So, what happens?

31:27.427 --> 31:29.636
Jarrett does a stretch in the penitentiary.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.848
In case he get lonely
and wants to talk to someone...

31:33.057 --> 31:37.060
...we're gonna let one of our boys
do a stretch right in the same cell.

31:37.520 --> 31:38.937
Still going fishing, Hank?

31:39.147 --> 31:40.689
Yeah.

31:41.107 --> 31:44.318
- In what prison?
- You'll enjoy the food. Wonderful chef.

31:44.527 --> 31:47.279
- Arrested him myself.
- Okay, okay, what's the pitch?

31:47.655 --> 31:50.032
You'll be committed to the penitentiary
in Illinois.

31:50.241 --> 31:53.702
You'll be one of Jarrett's cellmates.
Stick with him until you find out...

31:53.912 --> 31:58.582
...where he unloaded $300,000 in federal
currency without a single bill showing up.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.752
Also, try to learn the identity
of the very special fence...

32:01.961 --> 32:04.254
...that engineered this deal.

32:05.298 --> 32:07.132
How does he operate?

32:07.425 --> 32:10.010
Buys stolen money here,
30, 40 cents on the dollar.

32:10.219 --> 32:14.264
Peddles it on the European black market
for, pfft, who knows how much.

32:14.474 --> 32:17.517
No questions asked. Sweet racket.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.646
- In step with the times.
- Well, that's your assignment.

32:21.481 --> 32:25.692
I wouldn't ask you to do another
undercover job if we weren't up against it.

32:25.902 --> 32:26.985
- Hello, Hank.
- Hi.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.404
Prison records from Illinois.
Your new buddies.

32:29.572 --> 32:30.948
Busy little place, isn't it?

32:31.115 --> 32:33.325
Twenty-seven hundred
of the roughest and toughest.

32:33.534 --> 32:36.578
And a few who might recognize you.
Let's go to work.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.126
- Find another old client?
- Yeah. Red Draper.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.504
Questioned him in '46
about a warehouse job.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.339
Well, that makes two for transfer.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.926
- Better run through the arrest once more.
- Oh, yeah. let's see.

32:51.135 --> 32:53.553
I'll be picked up in a joint
known as Tom's Hideaway.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.347
- Bill's Hideaway.
- Bill's Hideaway.

32:55.556 --> 32:57.265
On what seems like
an ordinary hood roundup.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.893
One of the boys spots me as a lamister.
I make a break for it.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.521
When I pick myself off the floor,
I'm meek as a baby.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.148
- How do I get information out to you?
- Visiting days.

33:05.358 --> 33:06.608
Oh, mother again?

33:06.818 --> 33:09.361
- Wife this time.
- Wife? Ooh, fine.

33:09.570 --> 33:12.531
One thing, though. This time,
get me somebody with a good memory.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.158
I had a lot of trouble with my mother
in San Quentin.

33:15.368 --> 33:18.829
This time we'll get you a girl in the bureau
who's a memory expert.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.832
- I'm partial to blonds.
- Well, who isn't?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.959
As soon as I pick her,
I'll send you a picture.

33:24.127 --> 33:25.210
Uh-uh.

33:25.378 --> 33:26.753
- We move this guy.
- Who is he?

33:26.963 --> 33:29.047
Bo Creel. Arrested him two years ago.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.429
Bo Creel. Wait a minute.

33:35.596 --> 33:37.681
- We don't have to worry about him.
- Huh?

33:37.849 --> 33:40.851
Finishes his stretch Saturday.
He'll be out before you're sentenced.

33:41.060 --> 33:44.146
Good. Bo Creel would know me
in the dark.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.691
This job isn't gonna be
like any of the others, Hank.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.902
You see, uh,
there's insanity in the Jarretts.

33:51.112 --> 33:54.698
Some of it rubbed off on Cody.
His father died in an institution.

33:55.742 --> 33:59.703
I've had a few strange cellmates in my time,
but this sounds like the jackpot.

34:00.204 --> 34:02.372
When he was a kid,
he used to fake headaches...

34:02.582 --> 34:06.418
...to get his mother's attention away
from the rest of the family. It worked.

34:06.627 --> 34:08.962
As he grew up,
the fancied headaches became real...

34:09.172 --> 34:11.757
...until now they tear him to pieces.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.342
Any minute,
he's apt to crack open at the seams...

34:14.886 --> 34:17.721
...and there goes our case.
So you'll be working against time.

34:17.929 --> 34:20.474
Suits me. Quicker the better.

34:20.683 --> 34:24.018
Except that Cody's not an easy guy
to get close to in a hurry.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.230
The only person he's ever cared about
or trusted is his mother.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.442
No one else has ever made a dent,
not even his wife.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.944
His mother's been the prop
that's held him up.

34:33.154 --> 34:36.614
He's got a fierce
psychopathic devotion for her.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.993
All his life, whenever he got in a spot,
he'd just put out his hand...

34:40.203 --> 34:42.079
...and there was Ma Jarrett.

34:42.496 --> 34:46.166
Without her, maybe Cody'd...
Just like his old man.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.252
You mean I'm supposed to take
Mama's place?

34:49.462 --> 34:52.047
Never can tell. He might need someone.

34:52.255 --> 34:55.425
I'll practice up on my lullabies.
Nothing else here.

34:55.635 --> 34:57.928
Good. Let's run through
your background again.

34:58.137 --> 35:00.514
Born Detroit, March 23rd, 1919.

35:00.723 --> 35:04.267
State reform school, 1934, vandalism.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.771
Arrested: suspicion, grand larceny,
Portland, 1939.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.022
Good.

35:09.232 --> 35:12.400
The State of Illinois v. Arthur Cody Jarrett.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.070
Arthur Cody Jarrett,
on your own admission...

35:15.279 --> 35:17.781
...you have been convicted of the robbery
of the Palace Hotel...

35:17.949 --> 35:19.825
...on the night of October 12th.

35:20.034 --> 35:22.869
And it is now my duty
to pronounce sentence.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.581
For the crime of grand larceny,
you are hereby sentenced to serve...

35:26.791 --> 35:29.417
...not less than one
and not more than three years...

35:29.627 --> 35:31.962
...in the state penitentiary.

35:32.922 --> 35:36.675
The State of Illinois v. Victor Pardo.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.636
How is he, tough?

35:55.361 --> 35:58.780
With Big Ed giving the orders now,
there'll be all kinds of fireworks.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.492
He's got plans that'll make
the old Jarrett mob look like a...

36:05.580 --> 36:07.497
Can you read him?

36:07.957 --> 36:08.999
Yeah.

36:11.252 --> 36:15.547
Parker moves his lips pretty good.
It's about Big Ed.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.716
What'd he say?

36:18.009 --> 36:20.635
He's the number one boy now,
Parker says.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.180
In more ways than one.

36:25.516 --> 36:29.227
- What was that crack?
- I couldn't read him, Cody.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.522
- Was that about my wife?
- Honest, Cody. He had his mouth covered.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.233
Maybe a kick in his skull
would do him some good.

36:35.443 --> 36:39.196
They got rules in this chicken coop.
You start anything, you wind up in the hole.

36:39.405 --> 36:40.947
Did I ask you for any advice?

36:41.157 --> 36:42.199
Look, Pardo...

36:42.408 --> 36:43.825
...I've been watching you.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.620
Up till now you haven't done anything
I can put my finger on.

36:46.829 --> 36:50.790
Maybe that's what bothers me. I don't know
you, and what I don't know, I don't trust.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.376
You're just a face and a number.
Let's keep it that way.

36:53.586 --> 36:57.172
- When I want your help, I'll ask for it.
- Have it your way, Cody.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.507
Attention, men. Attention.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.552
The following new men report
to the dispensary for shots:

37:02.762 --> 37:05.764
Abbott, Jordan, Bacon, Pardo, Butler...

37:05.973 --> 37:09.226
...Jenkins, Jarrett, Williams, Phillips.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.772
Hughes, Russell.

37:13.981 --> 37:15.732
Keep it moving, boys. No talking.

37:16.525 --> 37:17.817
Well, if it ain't Bo Creel.

37:18.027 --> 37:20.987
Boys in L.A. had a coming-out party
planned for you a month ago.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.032
Yeah, I was packing and, bang,
flat on my back with pneumonia.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.244
- The doc's checking me out today.
- Well, see you in eight years.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.162
Hyde, Frank.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.206
Keep moving, boys. No talking.

37:31.415 --> 37:33.250
Jacoby, George.

37:33.459 --> 37:35.377
All right, move up.

37:36.963 --> 37:39.464
Jarrett, Arthur Cody.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.761
I'm leaving tomorrow, Cody.
Anything I can do for you on the coast?

37:44.971 --> 37:48.181
Yeah. Look up Big Ed.
Tell him I was asking for him.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.433
Johnson, Bate.

37:53.771 --> 37:55.480
Holden, John.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.940
Get the lead out.

37:57.149 --> 37:59.234
Coon, Fred.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.699
Scared, sonny?

38:08.494 --> 38:10.620
Break it up over there.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.623
Who's that reindeer?

38:18.004 --> 38:19.671
I didn't do nothing. He's nuts.

38:19.880 --> 38:23.800
A couple of months in solitary
will cool you off, bugger.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.181
Fisher.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.227
Ryley. Pardo.

38:34.437 --> 38:37.647
I'm awfully sorry, my good man,
but Mr. Pardo is still on vacation.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.149
His month's up today.

38:39.358 --> 38:41.401
It is, huh? That's cozy.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.361
Look at what they left out of this one.

38:43.529 --> 38:45.488
It must have been a lulu
before the warden got it.

38:46.907 --> 38:47.991
- Hey, Herbert?
- Yeah.

38:48.200 --> 38:51.119
- Any chance you get, read Pardo, will you?
- Why?

38:51.329 --> 38:53.413
- Read him.
- Maybe on visiting days.

38:53.622 --> 38:54.873
That's when they loosen up.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.167
What you got against him?
Pardo's all right.

38:57.376 --> 38:59.669
Didn't I check his record
up at the dispensary?

38:59.879 --> 39:03.423
That's only a record.
What else do we know about him?

39:05.885 --> 39:07.886
Maybe that envelope
will tell us something.

39:08.095 --> 39:11.056
- Think you ought to? That's U.S. mail.
- I'm a U.S. citizen, ain't I?

39:11.265 --> 39:12.557
Not lately.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.522
Ah, wife, eh? Kid don't talk much.

39:19.732 --> 39:24.027
When you're married,
you don't get a chance to. Nice.

39:25.154 --> 39:26.821
- Hmm.
- We'll put it over here...

39:26.989 --> 39:28.406
...where we can all look at it.

39:28.574 --> 39:31.659
- He'll know we've been in his mail.
- All right, so he'll know.

39:31.869 --> 39:35.330
Be a nice surprise
when he gets out of solitary.

39:46.300 --> 39:47.550
Hi, kid.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.388
Let me shake the hand
that slugged Roy Parker. Heh.

39:51.597 --> 39:55.642
Why did you do it, Pardo? You know
they got rules in this joint, don't you?

39:55.851 --> 40:00.397
Yeah? Maybe I didn't wanna
get my shots.

40:06.946 --> 40:11.074
I guess, uh... I guess his eyes
ain't so good after solitary.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.576
All right, all right, what's the gag?

40:16.705 --> 40:18.498
Ah...

40:28.217 --> 40:30.093
Hey, hey.

40:30.302 --> 40:33.513
What's she done to herself?
I had the best-looking blond I ever saw.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.473
The second my back's turned,
she's a brunette.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.767
It don't even look like her anymore.

40:37.977 --> 40:39.018
Maybe she's hot.

40:39.228 --> 40:42.063
Yeah. Whenever I changed my hair,
so did my missus.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.358
Yeah, well, she'd better be a blond
when I get out of here.

40:49.113 --> 40:52.782
Yeah,
too bad your little trick didn't work, Pardo.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.118
Huh?

40:55.327 --> 40:58.329
Doc says you gotta
take your shots anyway.

41:06.505 --> 41:08.256
Yeah, Benny.

41:26.901 --> 41:30.904
Parker's shooting his mouth off again.
Told Benny your boys pulled a caper.

41:31.113 --> 41:33.239
- How much did they get?
- Fifty-seven grand.

41:33.449 --> 41:35.492
- Not bad.
- Are you in for any of it?

41:35.701 --> 41:37.827
- Full share.
- No kidding?

41:38.037 --> 41:40.205
Why not? What's being in here
got to do with it?

41:40.414 --> 41:42.499
They're still his boys.
What they get, he gets.

41:42.666 --> 41:44.918
Yeah, Ma sees to that.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.427
Get one thing clear, all of you.

41:54.637 --> 41:58.389
Anything we get,
Cody's in for his full share.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.600
That's how it is.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.229
Anyone thinks different, say so now...

42:04.438 --> 42:07.815
...or would you rather wait
till Cody gets out?

42:08.776 --> 42:11.277
Well, any argument?

42:11.654 --> 42:13.863
Het? Cotton?

42:14.073 --> 42:17.200
Happy? Ed?

42:17.993 --> 42:19.994
How come, Big Ed?

42:20.204 --> 42:22.413
You're the one I expected to give trouble.

42:22.623 --> 42:23.998
Fair is fair.

42:24.208 --> 42:27.710
We ain't gonna forget Cody
after all he did for us.

42:27.920 --> 42:31.089
Cody will be real grateful to you.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.383
Where do you think you're going?

42:33.968 --> 42:35.468
To pick strawberries.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.472
All right, boys, beat it. It's getting late.

42:40.099 --> 42:44.018
Het, tell Verna I want her back in here.

42:56.448 --> 42:59.075
- What's eating you, sugar?
- You and your big ideas.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.119
That's all they are, ideas.

43:01.328 --> 43:04.622
"You and me belong together, sugar.
Just leave it to Big Ed."

43:04.832 --> 43:06.708
I'm sick of waiting for you
to make your move.

43:06.875 --> 43:09.127
You're as scared of Cody as any of them.

43:09.336 --> 43:12.505
He's still Mr. Big, in prison or out.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.592
- What makes you think so?
- You. Fair is fair, is it?

43:15.801 --> 43:18.636
That's quite a beef you put up
about Cody being in on the cut.

43:18.846 --> 43:22.640
See, a guy who thinks his pals are taking
care of him, he gets kind of careless.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.475
What does that mean?

43:24.685 --> 43:28.396
Alive, Cody gets out in one,
two years, maybe.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.982
Dead, he gets out sooner.

43:33.193 --> 43:34.527
Dead?

43:34.737 --> 43:37.572
Right now he's a sitting duck
up there in that pen.

43:37.781 --> 43:41.743
He's rubbing elbows with a guy
that does anything I say.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.079
When, Ed?

43:45.497 --> 43:47.790
When I say so.

44:13.734 --> 44:15.860
Where's Pardo?

44:26.205 --> 44:29.207
You know all about radios.
Maybe you can fix the warden's.

44:29.416 --> 44:32.919
- I'll fix it so it blows up in his face.
- Suits me.

45:37.609 --> 45:39.068
Come on. Back to your places.

45:39.278 --> 45:41.404
Go ahead. Get on back there. Go.

45:41.613 --> 45:43.114
Get on back there.

45:44.450 --> 45:46.200
Go ahead. Get on back there.

45:46.410 --> 45:47.452
Are you hurt, Jarrett?

45:47.661 --> 45:51.080
No. No. Things were getting
kind of dull around here, anyway.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.750
Back to your work. You too, Pardo.

45:56.795 --> 46:00.047
- The lever slipped.
- You can tell that to the warden later.

46:00.841 --> 46:02.508
I saw that just in time.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.302
What do you want, a medal?

46:04.511 --> 46:06.637
You would have looked like that barrel.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.015
You almost walked into it yourself.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.477
Why should you care
if a guy named Cody Jarrett gets his...

46:12.686 --> 46:14.103
...if you don't want something?

46:14.938 --> 46:17.023
Okay. Keep your medal.

46:17.733 --> 46:20.943
Come on, break it up. Get going, Jarrett.

46:37.586 --> 46:39.504
Sorry, Cody.

46:39.713 --> 46:42.465
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it, Parker.

46:42.674 --> 46:44.467
Accidents will happen.

46:44.676 --> 46:47.386
Attention. The following men have visitors:

46:47.596 --> 46:50.515
Reynolds, Allen, Jarrett, Kaminsky...

46:50.724 --> 46:54.101
...Williams, Phillips, Jordan.

47:04.071 --> 47:05.446
Hello, Ma.

47:05.656 --> 47:06.739
Cody.

47:06.949 --> 47:09.367
- You've been hurt.
- Oh, it's nothing. Just an accident.

47:09.576 --> 47:11.911
- You sure?
- What kind of question is that?

47:12.120 --> 47:14.247
What are you so nervous about?
Anything wrong?

47:14.456 --> 47:17.250
- Plenty.
- Like what?

47:17.960 --> 47:19.043
That's why I come.

47:19.711 --> 47:21.587
I'm the one to tell you.

47:21.797 --> 47:24.757
It's Big Ed and Verna. They run out.

47:25.425 --> 47:28.177
It's my fault, Cody. I let you down.

47:28.887 --> 47:32.014
I said I'd take care of things
and I let you down.

47:32.474 --> 47:35.935
I saw it coming,
but I didn't think he'd have the guts.

47:36.144 --> 47:37.645
Forget it, Ma. Forget it.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.147
It was in the cards
for Big Ed to make his try.

47:40.357 --> 47:41.691
Don't you care?

47:42.150 --> 47:46.571
Sure. What's mine is mine,
but I ain't gonna let it make me sick.

47:46.780 --> 47:49.991
- I'll take care of them when I get out.
- That's what I told myself.

47:50.200 --> 47:52.618
And I'll help you, Cody, like always.

47:52.828 --> 47:56.330
You'll be out soon,
back on top of the world.

47:56.790 --> 47:58.833
With you around, Ma,
nothing can stop me.

47:59.042 --> 48:00.793
That's right, son.

48:01.003 --> 48:04.088
Only you got to be careful about Big Ed.

48:04.298 --> 48:07.717
If I know Big Ed, right now he's doing
enough worrying for the both of us.

48:07.926 --> 48:10.011
Maybe not.

48:11.054 --> 48:13.931
What do you mean?
Can't expect me to come looking for him.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.850
That's what I'm getting at.

48:16.059 --> 48:20.938
When you get out of here, he knows
his life isn't worth a plugged nickel.

48:21.148 --> 48:25.610
When a tinhorn like that thinks
he's big enough to take your place...

48:25.819 --> 48:28.195
...he's gotta feel pretty safe.

48:28.405 --> 48:31.616
And now all of a sudden,
he makes his move...

48:31.825 --> 48:36.579
...like he was sure you'd never get out
of here except in a box.

48:37.205 --> 48:38.497
Hmm.

48:39.666 --> 48:41.292
I see what you mean.

48:41.501 --> 48:43.210
You said it was an accident?

48:43.420 --> 48:46.923
- For a minute, I thought it was.
- How'd it happen?

48:47.132 --> 48:49.008
A pal of Big Ed's dropped something.

48:49.217 --> 48:51.886
You see, Cody? I was right.

48:52.095 --> 48:54.847
He was figuring you'd be dead.

48:55.641 --> 48:57.725
Relax, Ma. I'm still here, ain't I?

48:57.935 --> 49:01.103
If he tried it once, he'll try it again.

49:01.313 --> 49:05.566
Well, I'll still walk out of this joint,
and then I'll take care of Big Ed.

49:05.817 --> 49:09.904
And let him live that long? No, Cody.

49:10.113 --> 49:11.781
I'll take care of Big Ed.

49:11.990 --> 49:14.200
No, no, Ma. You won't have a chance.

49:14.409 --> 49:18.537
Any time I can't handle his kind,
I'll know I'm getting old.

49:18.747 --> 49:22.166
No one does what he's done to you, son,
and gets away with it.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.502
No, Ma. Listen to me.
You won't have a chance.

49:24.711 --> 49:28.631
I'm going after him, Cody, to keep him
from having you knocked off in here.

49:28.840 --> 49:31.884
- I'm telling you, don't do it... Ma.
- Goodbye, Cody.

49:32.094 --> 49:34.762
Ma. Ma!

49:34.972 --> 49:36.931
Keep your hands off that wire.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.793
What's the matter, Parker?
I ain't gonna do anything.

50:06.753 --> 50:08.337
Not now.

50:08.547 --> 50:11.966
I'm gonna let you stay awake nights
and sweat it out.

50:12.175 --> 50:15.594
Then when I get ready, good and ready...

50:15.929 --> 50:17.930
...I'll pay you back.

50:21.560 --> 50:25.604
I'll take care of Big Ed.
I'll take care of Big Ed.

50:25.814 --> 50:29.859
I'll take care of him, Cody.
I'll take care of him, Cody.

50:30.318 --> 50:33.029
I'll take care of him, Cody.

50:59.264 --> 51:01.390
What's the matter, Cody?

51:03.727 --> 51:05.394
My head. My head.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.688
Cover for me? Cover for me.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.565
Watch it.

51:15.155 --> 51:17.698
Fingers are kind of thick today.

51:19.242 --> 51:21.869
No doctors. No doctors.

51:22.079 --> 51:24.955
It's all right now. He's gone.
Where's the pain?

51:25.165 --> 51:27.833
It's right here.

51:32.214 --> 51:34.924
Don't let it beat you, Cody.
You are a top man, aren't you?

51:35.133 --> 51:39.011
Since I was a kid, I been reading about you.
Always hoping I could join up with you.

51:39.221 --> 51:43.432
You don't wanna let a bunch of two-bit
mugs see Cody Jarrett down on his knees.

51:43.642 --> 51:45.184
Come on.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.125
You all right, Cody?

52:51.793 --> 52:55.045
Yeah. Just can't sleep, that's all.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.506
- That headache gone?
- Yeah.

52:57.716 --> 53:00.009
Then why can't you sleep?

53:04.431 --> 53:07.516
It's Ma. She's walking into trouble.

53:07.726 --> 53:10.811
- Anything I can do?
- No.

53:12.439 --> 53:15.733
Yeah, maybe there is, kid.

53:16.193 --> 53:17.818
Look...

53:18.320 --> 53:21.989
...for a while, I figured out that sitting out
this penny-ante stretch...

53:22.199 --> 53:24.867
...would be a kind of vacation...

53:25.076 --> 53:27.703
...take the heat off me for another job.

53:27.913 --> 53:31.624
Well, sometimes you make plans
and sometimes they don't work out.

53:31.833 --> 53:35.377
Then you gotta get doing,
and fast, you understand?

53:35.587 --> 53:37.504
Mm-hm.

53:38.840 --> 53:41.675
I got business on the outside.

53:41.968 --> 53:45.304
- Going to crash out?
- Yeah.

53:45.555 --> 53:47.014
Wanna come along?

53:47.224 --> 53:51.685
- Maybe I do. Did you tell anybody else?
- Mm-mm.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.155
Figured on cutting in Tommy Ryley.

54:03.365 --> 54:07.076
You cut in one, first thing you know,
you cut in 10. What do you want Ryley for?

54:07.285 --> 54:09.828
He's got a gun stashed.

54:10.288 --> 54:11.872
Don't need a gun.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.750
They're not gonna open the gates for us.

54:16.169 --> 54:18.837
You think you're the only guy
in this parlor that wants out?

54:19.047 --> 54:21.340
What do you think
I've been dreaming about nights?

54:21.549 --> 54:25.302
I got a way of getting a mile from this joint
before anybody knows what hit them.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.888
- Without artillery, it can't be done.
- No?

54:28.098 --> 54:32.309
Listen, I'm a pretty handy fella
with electricity, you remember?

54:32.894 --> 54:37.982
Well, I figured a way to fix the generators.
You know what that means?

54:38.858 --> 54:40.150
I got a slight idea.

54:40.360 --> 54:45.364
The generators control everything,
searchlights, gun turret, main gate.

54:45.573 --> 54:50.911
Who needs artillery?
Only we've gotta do it alone.

54:51.204 --> 54:53.455
We're gonna need a car.

54:53.915 --> 54:56.292
My wife's coming tomorrow.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.169
We'll set it all up.

55:02.674 --> 55:06.802
All right, kid. It's a deal.

55:07.012 --> 55:10.764
And if it works, I'll pay you back.

55:11.349 --> 55:14.393
Maybe you'll give me that medal, huh?

55:15.437 --> 55:17.771
Solid gold.

55:39.336 --> 55:40.419
Good news for you, Herbert.

55:40.628 --> 55:43.505
Ah, you've had good news
for the last 12 years.

55:43.715 --> 55:46.967
I'm working on a plan
to get your case reviewed.

55:51.056 --> 55:53.849
- Hello, Margaret.
- You're looking well, Vic.

55:54.059 --> 55:55.309
We're being watched.

55:55.477 --> 55:58.854
Say anything you like and make it good.
And listen to me carefully.

55:59.564 --> 56:02.191
Divorce? Vic, you can't mean that.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.151
Why? What have I done?

56:04.361 --> 56:05.819
That's fine.

56:06.029 --> 56:08.655
Jarrett's getting out of here
and I'm going with him.

56:09.240 --> 56:13.869
I know how you feel, Vic, but don't ask me
to do anything that'll break my heart.

56:14.788 --> 56:16.872
It might be better for you.

56:17.082 --> 56:20.250
It's my life.
Let me decide what to do with it.

56:20.460 --> 56:22.586
Just the two of us.

56:23.046 --> 56:26.048
Tell Evans we'll break out
Thursday night.

56:27.550 --> 56:30.552
Tell him to plant a getaway car
with an oscillator.

56:30.762 --> 56:34.014
Can you remember that?
With an oscillator.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.974
I'll remember, darling.

56:37.519 --> 56:40.479
- Everything clear?
- Perfectly clear.

56:42.482 --> 56:43.941
You won't be sorry, Vic.

56:44.150 --> 56:46.902
When you get out, we'll be happy.
I'll see to that.

56:47.112 --> 56:50.030
Nice going.
Where'd you learn all that, soap opera?

56:50.949 --> 56:52.366
How did you know?

56:52.575 --> 56:54.952
This time I'm going right to the top
to get you out.

56:55.161 --> 56:57.871
- Herbert, are you listening?
- Sure, Jerry. Sure.

56:58.081 --> 57:01.792
But if that fails,
you just have to serve the rest of your term.

57:02.001 --> 57:06.380
Jerry, you couldn't get me out of here
if I was pardoned.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.716
All right, this is the prison.

57:09.926 --> 57:11.885
We place the getaway car in these trees...

57:12.095 --> 57:15.431
...with the oscillator under its rear axle
and hooked up to the battery.

57:15.640 --> 57:18.058
Our cars will be parked back here,
a mile or so away.

57:18.268 --> 57:19.601
One here, the other here.

57:20.228 --> 57:22.813
We assume that Jarrett and Hank
come out here somewhere.

57:23.022 --> 57:25.190
They pile into the getaway car,
and they're off.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.608
- You ready, Ernie?
- Ready.

57:26.776 --> 57:28.944
The transmitter wavelength is 47.1.

57:30.363 --> 57:32.322
Forty-seven-point-one.

57:32.532 --> 57:33.699
All right, switch it on.

57:37.370 --> 57:39.997
Our receivers pick up that sound
from the oscillator...

57:40.206 --> 57:43.292
...which enables us to cross-plot
their exact position.

57:44.210 --> 57:46.128
For example...

57:46.921 --> 57:53.010
...suppose the impulse received here
has a bearing of 210 degrees.

57:53.219 --> 57:56.847
This one here reads 45 degrees.

57:57.056 --> 57:58.682
We plot them like so.

57:58.892 --> 58:01.518
Where the lines cross,
that's where they are.

58:02.437 --> 58:04.271
It doesn't matter how far they travel.

58:04.481 --> 58:08.233
As long as our cars are within receiving
distance, we can tell where they are.

58:08.443 --> 58:10.110
All right, Ernie. Switch it off.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.112
How far is receiving distance?

58:12.322 --> 58:14.323
We had a dry run on a car yesterday.

58:14.532 --> 58:17.576
- Kept tabs on him for 20 miles.
- That little thing?

58:17.785 --> 58:20.746
You could make one out of your
bedside radio. I'll show you how.

58:20.955 --> 58:24.833
Sometime when you've got a week to spare,
Ernie will tell you all about electronics.

58:25.043 --> 58:29.588
We'll meet at the airport in 40 minutes.
Be in Springfield late this afternoon.

59:03.915 --> 59:04.957
Tonight.

59:06.167 --> 59:07.209
Tonight?

59:37.574 --> 59:40.576
Isn't that Lefeld down there? Nat Lefeld?

59:43.288 --> 59:45.497
From the coast mob. Came in today.

59:45.707 --> 59:47.833
They checked him in today?

59:48.751 --> 59:51.211
Ask him how my mother is.

59:54.048 --> 59:57.092
- Ask about Cody's mother.
- Ask about Cody's mother.

59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.929
- Ask about Cody's mother.
- How is Cody's mother?

01:00:01.764 --> 01:00:04.391
- She's dead.
- She's dead.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:08.270
- She's dead.
- She's dead.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.566
She's dead.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.902
Huh?

01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:19.281
Dead?

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:32.544
No.

01:00:57.028 --> 01:01:01.073
I wanna get out! I wanna get out of here!

01:01:01.282 --> 01:01:03.075
Get me out!

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:09.039
I wanna get out of here!

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:14.086
I wanna get out! I wanna get out of here!

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:17.005
Get me out!

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:19.966
Get me out!

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.064
Special for Jarrett.

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:37.359
- Hi, doc.
- Hi, Ryley.

01:01:44.575 --> 01:01:46.702
Hi, Cody. Brought you some grub.

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:48.912
Hot soup made special.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:51.748
Mm, how are you, Vic?
Glad to see you, kid.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.834
You're a good boy, Vic.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:56.461
- It's me, Tommy Ryley.
- Mm-hm.

01:01:56.671 --> 01:02:00.298
That's right, Vic. Play it smart.
Play it smart. That's the only way it'll work.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:03.135
Here, get some of this into you.

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:05.053
Next time you come, bring the gun.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:06.346
Huh?

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.724
I like the way you go about it.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:09.975
Bring the gun.

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.397
Sure you won't try
some of this delicious soup?

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.524
I'll get it if you take me along, Cody.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.405
I don't want any of that slop. Pfft.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.407
Try it on the warden.

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:26.908
It's a deal.

01:02:27.535 --> 01:02:30.120
If you don't want it,
I guess you don't want it.

01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:32.831
But you gotta keep up
your strength, fella.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:36.835
And if the warden don't want it,
try it on the governor.

01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:38.378
Guess he ain't hungry.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.603
Dr. Simpson speaking.

01:02:54.812 --> 01:02:58.523
Oh, yes, warden.
I've just finished my report on Jarrett.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.942
Violent, homicidal.

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:05.030
He'll probably have recurrent periods
of normal behavior, but...

01:03:05.239 --> 01:03:07.616
Yes, sir,
our psychiatrists are coming tonight.

01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:09.993
They'll commit him to the institution.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.246
Yes, warden.
I suggest you prepare the release for him.

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:14.748
Thank you, warden.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.168
- Oscillator ready?
- Ready to sing.

01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:21.296
Put the car in the trees.
We'll pick you up and take our positions.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.341
- Telephone, Mr. Evans.
- All right. Hold it, boys.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:29.179
Evans speaking. Hello, warden.

01:03:31.015 --> 01:03:32.891
That is bad news.

01:03:33.184 --> 01:03:36.394
Not altogether a surprise.
Thanks for your cooperation anyway.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:37.771
Say, by the way, uh...

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:41.817
...tomorrow there'll be a pardon coming
through for one of your inmates, Vic Pardo.

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:43.568
Rush it through, will you?

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:45.320
Oh, thanks.

01:03:46.113 --> 01:03:47.739
No dice, boys. The party's off.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.784
Jarrett's a raving maniac.
They've got him in a straitjacket.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.495
Good thing for Hank
it happened inside instead of out.

01:03:53.704 --> 01:03:56.873
It's the only good thing about it.
Take the oscillator off the car.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.209
I'll get the plane tickets for 10:00 tonight.

01:03:59.418 --> 01:04:03.213
- You have a car to take us to the airport?
- It'll be there, Mr. Evans.

01:04:03.422 --> 01:04:06.716
Sorry, boys. They can't all work out.

01:04:14.642 --> 01:04:18.019
How would you like
a little change of scenery, Cody?

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:21.356
Someplace where we might be able
to cure your headaches?

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:24.276
You wouldn't mind a little trip,
would you?

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.404
No. Might do me some good.

01:04:28.781 --> 01:04:30.490
- Doctor.
- Not now, Ryley.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:34.119
- I want something to eat.
- You've sent away two meals already.

01:04:34.328 --> 01:04:35.745
That's why I'm hungry now.

01:04:35.955 --> 01:04:38.623
Hunger's always a hopeful sign.

01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:47.883
Nobody feeds Cody Jarrett.
What am I, a kid?

01:04:48.092 --> 01:04:50.427
It's all right to remove the straitjacket,
doctor.

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:52.178
I'll do it.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:08.069
They got you tied up good.

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.458
The examination's over.
All right, turn around.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.129
Now, keep them quiet.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.840
Doctor, you're with me.

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:37.891
I want you to make
a little phone call for me.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.061
And no slip-ups,
or you're gonna need a doctor.

01:05:46.817 --> 01:05:50.862
You're taking a little walk, boys.
Doc wants you in the dispensary.

01:05:57.536 --> 01:05:58.620
All right.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:01.665
Wait here.

01:06:02.583 --> 01:06:04.250
- Come on, Parker.
- Where to?

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.836
Dispensary.
Special invitation of the doctor.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.847
Here. Tie and gag him.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:27.941
Drop that stick. Now.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:29.943
Get in the cell.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:37.617
All right. Now, you two, come along
and bring the tuxedo with you.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:42.414
- Reader, cover the outside door.
- We'll not make it this way.

01:06:42.623 --> 01:06:44.457
- We'll never get to the gate.
- Who says?

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:46.209
Why me? What do you want with me?

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:49.462
You're my pal.
I'm taking you with me. Come on.

01:06:50.798 --> 01:06:53.425
- Hey, look... Unh!
- Get.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.969
You got me wrong.
I got nothing against you.

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:59.973
It was Big Ed. He told me to do it. You
wouldn't kill me in cold blood, would you?

01:07:00.182 --> 01:07:01.766
No, I'll let you warm up a little.

01:07:01.976 --> 01:07:05.603
- Clear as the fingerprint that nailed me.
- Psycho, put that zoot suit on him.

01:07:05.813 --> 01:07:06.855
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:10.608
- My way, there wouldn't be no shooting.
- Ain't gonna be any my way either.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:13.570
We're going out of here in a car
like gentlemen on a picnic.

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:16.531
They want me to take a little trip.
We're gonna take a trip.

01:07:16.741 --> 01:07:19.659
Only it better be a quiet one.
Come on, now. Get.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.038
Pick up those hats.

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:36.593
Everybody down. Ryley, get those keys.

01:07:38.179 --> 01:07:41.014
You get in the trunk.
Come on, get it open.

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:42.766
Get in.

01:07:44.935 --> 01:07:46.770
Ryley, you get in the front.

01:07:46.979 --> 01:07:49.481
Reader, you get in the back
and make like you're loony.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:51.274
And, you, you drive.

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:55.695
Now, you know how jittery I am.
Any minute I'm liable to explode. Now get.

01:08:06.373 --> 01:08:09.250
Now, if we don't make it,
I got six slugs in this gun.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.710
One for each of us.

01:08:20.136 --> 01:08:22.805
- Dr. Harris.
- Good night, doc.

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:41.491
Hello.

01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:43.660
Speaking.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:45.411
What?

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:46.955
All right. Right away.

01:08:47.163 --> 01:08:49.707
Turn back. Jarrett's busted out.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.464
Black sedan. Probably headed southwest.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:59.759
Following are the names of the men
who escaped with Cody Jarrett:

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:04.430
Thomas Ryley, Roy Parker,
Michael Curtin, Vic Pardo.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.475
Do not shoot
unless absolutely necessary.

01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:10.353
Hostages in car. Do not shoot...

01:09:10.563 --> 01:09:13.231
- One break for our boy.
- What's Hank's procedure now?

01:09:13.439 --> 01:09:16.192
He'll stay with Jarrett
till he gets what he's after.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:26.828
I like your tailor. How do you like mine?

01:09:27.078 --> 01:09:28.537
Tommy, rustle up some grub.

01:09:28.747 --> 01:09:30.622
You, in there.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:36.171
Vic, what's taking you so long?

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.923
Trying to find some more artillery.

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:42.969
- Let it ring.
- Someone might get suspicious.

01:09:49.643 --> 01:09:51.227
Come on.

01:10:06.285 --> 01:10:09.871
- How you doing, Parker?
- It's stuffy in here. I need some air.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.541
Oh. Stuffy, huh? I'll give you a little air.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.370
No clue
to their movements has been reported...

01:10:50.537 --> 01:10:54.123
...since their assault last night on a service
station north of Gallup, New Mexico.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.918
It is assumed now
by federal law enforcement agencies...

01:10:57.127 --> 01:11:00.630
...that Jarrett and the other escaped
convicts are heading for California.

01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:06.010
This concludes the nightly news summary
from KFKL, San Bernardino.

01:11:31.328 --> 01:11:33.288
Did you check the windows?

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:38.668
- I said, did you check the windows?
- Ed, let's get out of here.

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:42.755
Take it easy, baby.
We're ready for him when he comes.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:47.969
I can't stand another night, Ed.
Listening, going crazy.

01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:52.724
It ain't just like waiting for some human
who wants to kill you. Cody ain't human.

01:11:52.933 --> 01:11:54.934
Fill him full of lead
and he'll still come at you.

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:57.687
Plug him and he drops,
same as anybody else.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:11:59.480
The boys didn't think so.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.816
Why did they beat it
down to San Berdoo?

01:12:02.693 --> 01:12:04.861
Because they know
this is between me and Cody.

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.779
They'll be back when it's over.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:08.948
You'll be dead.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:15.705
Maybe so.

01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:19.876
But the time comes when a man's
gotta stop running away and face things.

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:21.627
Or else go on running for good.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:24.839
All right, throw your life away.
Stay here and shoot it out.

01:12:25.049 --> 01:12:29.052
- Me? I'm going. I wanna live.
- Cody might have some ideas about that.

01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:31.596
I'll go someplace he'll never find me.

01:12:31.805 --> 01:12:34.599
The world ain't big enough, sugar.

01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:38.144
Not when he finds out
what you did to his ma.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:50.365
- You'd tell him?
- If you run out on me.

01:12:53.243 --> 01:12:56.329
- Why not?
- But I only did it for you, Ed.

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:57.747
She had you covered.

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:03.252
Cody still ain't going to like to hear
that she got it in the back.

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.051
Feel more like staying now?

01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:02.830
I said I'd be back.

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:09.378
Now tell me you're glad to see me.
Only say it low so nobody can hear.

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:17.178
Cody, I'm so glad to see you.

01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:19.055
I've been praying you'd come back.

01:15:19.264 --> 01:15:21.682
I couldn't stand it any longer.
I was running away.

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:22.934
- From Big Ed?
- Yeah.

01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:25.520
- What's the matter, don't you like him?
- No. No.

01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:27.772
Maybe you shouldn't have teamed up
with him, huh?

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:29.148
I couldn't help it, Cody.

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.817
He said if I didn't go away with him,
he'd have you killed.

01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:34.904
All I wanted was for you to come back.

01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:38.574
That's the truth. I love you, Cody.
I love you.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.618
- You let Ma die.
- No.

01:15:40.827 --> 01:15:42.411
Didn't even raise a finger to help her.

01:15:42.579 --> 01:15:44.830
Just stood there
and watched Big Ed kill her.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.374
I tell you, you got it wrong.

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:47.959
Maybe you thought it was funny...

01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:50.002
...an old woman taking on a guy
like that, huh?

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:52.713
No. I tried to warn her...

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:54.507
...but he caught me and beat me.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:57.635
And then when Ma came,
he was waiting for her, and he...

01:15:59.137 --> 01:16:02.348
- I can't tell you.
- Tell me.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:05.309
He got her in the back.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.570
- Is he in there now?
- Yeah.

01:16:15.779 --> 01:16:19.073
But you gotta be careful.
He's got the house rigged up like a trap.

01:16:19.283 --> 01:16:22.159
You can't get in unless I tell you how.

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:24.078
Mm-hm.

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.031
- Ed.
- Stay where you are.

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:45.910
What was that bell downstairs?

01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:48.162
It was me, Ed.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.418
What were you doing down there?

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:57.630
I couldn't go through with it.
I tried, but I couldn't.

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:58.881
Talk sense.

01:17:59.424 --> 01:18:03.177
I was going to take the car and beat it.
I was scared.

01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:04.929
But I don't wanna go anymore.

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.685
You're my honey.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.402
Still got nerves?

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:26.450
Please, Ed. I feel like a drink.

01:18:35.919 --> 01:18:39.380
- Fix me one too.
- Here.

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.716
Catch.

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:47.323
Listen, Cody. Ed said this joint is a cinch.
Good for 50 grand.

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:48.991
- Who?
- Big Ed.

01:19:49.201 --> 01:19:50.826
Never heard of him. Go on.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:54.246
Well, the way we had it figured, Cody,
we pile out of the cars here...

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:57.082
...then we slug the guards,
and we grab the payroll here.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:20:01.045
- Blast our way out. It'll all take 50 seconds.
- They got cars. They'd follow you.

01:20:01.254 --> 01:20:04.256
That's where we use the gas truck.
I stall it right in the gates.

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:07.802
When we beat it in the getaway cars,
I got the truck keys in my pocket.

01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:09.470
Where do you get the gas truck?

01:20:09.679 --> 01:20:11.013
We got one stashed behind a barn.

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:13.224
Bought it with our own dough.
Twelve grand.

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:16.477
- You bought a gas truck?
- Yeah.

01:20:16.686 --> 01:20:19.188
What's the matter?
Forget how to steal one?

01:20:19.397 --> 01:20:22.066
Maybe it ain't so bad, Cody.
Twelve grand gets you 50.

01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:24.276
Fence the 50 and you get 20.

01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:27.488
Then what are you going to do with that?
Buy two more gas trucks?

01:20:27.697 --> 01:20:29.990
Joint like that's got the serial number
of every bill.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.701
Any guy who says he can fence
50 grand of it is crazy.

01:20:32.911 --> 01:20:34.286
The Trader ain't crazy.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:36.497
The Trader?

01:20:36.706 --> 01:20:38.207
Who's he?

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:40.459
My manager, kid.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:44.755
Come on.
Let's get a look at that $12,000 doll.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:47.132
Oh, Cody.

01:20:47.509 --> 01:20:51.262
- My radio ain't working again.
- Oh, no.

01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:53.973
Well, what do you want for it,
unemployment insurance?

01:20:54.391 --> 01:20:56.851
Can't I go down to San Berdoo
and get it fixed?

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:59.228
Nobody leaves here unless I say so.

01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:01.063
- Now, you...
- Ah!

01:21:02.148 --> 01:21:03.941
What's the matter, baby?

01:21:04.317 --> 01:21:06.527
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:21:08.613 --> 01:21:13.659
Now, go and read your comic books.
Good girl.

01:21:24.337 --> 01:21:28.966
Hey, uh, this fellow you call the Trader,
can you trust him?

01:21:29.175 --> 01:21:30.259
Why?

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:32.261
I wouldn't like to see my share
of any caper...

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.597
...being handed to some guy
who might disappear with it.

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:36.557
- Suspicious, ain't you?
- Oh, just careful.

01:21:36.766 --> 01:21:38.601
Well, you don't have to worry
about the Trader.

01:21:38.768 --> 01:21:40.936
Pays off on the spot in nice clean bills.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:45.065
- Yeah? Where does he get rid of the stuff?
- Ships to Europe. Collects both ends.

01:21:45.275 --> 01:21:46.692
Oh, smart operator, huh?

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:50.571
Well, you didn't see any of that dough
from that tunnel job popping up, did you?

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:53.157
Uh-huh. I like him better now.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.790
Not bad.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.710
Maybe your 12 grand
don't go down the drain after all.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.003
Hmm.

01:22:07.839 --> 01:22:09.131
- Hey, Het.
- Yeah?

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:11.884
You're a pretty good man with a blowtorch.

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:14.428
Suppose you could cut a hole in here
into the tank?

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:17.348
- Yeah, sure.
- Ah, we're back in business, boys.

01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:20.768
We're back in business.
And not Big Ed's way either.

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:22.144
And not for 50 grand.

01:22:22.562 --> 01:22:24.063
But first, a question.

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:28.317
Supposing you wanna push in
a place like Fort Knox...

01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:30.986
...and grab yourself
a couple of tons of gold.

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:33.364
What's the toughest thing
about a job like that?

01:22:33.573 --> 01:22:35.032
Getting inside the joint.

01:22:35.241 --> 01:22:38.077
A silver dollar
for the gentleman in the balcony.

01:22:38.286 --> 01:22:40.204
Right on the button. Getting in.

01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:43.916
Which brings me to a story
Ma used to tell me when I was a kid.

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.918
A story about a horse.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:50.965
Way back, there was a whole army
trying to knock over a place called Troy...

01:22:51.174 --> 01:22:54.551
...and getting nowhere fast.
Couldn't even put a dent in the walls.

01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:57.012
And one morning...

01:22:57.222 --> 01:23:00.140
One morning, the people of Troy wake up,
look over the walls...

01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:02.768
...and the attacking army disappeared.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:07.356
Men, boats, the works. Taken a powder.

01:23:07.565 --> 01:23:09.733
But they left one thing after them...

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:14.071
...a great big wooden horse.

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:15.739
And according to Ma...

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:32.756
Hello there. I was wondering
if I could use your telephone.

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:35.551
There ain't a phone here for five miles.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.344
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:39.680
- Good morning.
- Hello.

01:23:39.889 --> 01:23:42.558
- Lost your way, mister?
- No. I, uh, wanted to call my office...

01:23:42.767 --> 01:23:45.602
...but these gentlemen say
you don't have a phone here.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:48.355
They wouldn't know.
There's one in the house.

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:49.606
I'll show you where it is.

01:23:49.816 --> 01:23:51.692
Thank you very much.

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:57.114
There's a call that's gonna cost
more than a nickel.

01:23:57.323 --> 01:23:59.033
Looks like Big Ed's
gonna have company, huh?

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:01.702
- Yeah.
- And we got a new station wagon.

01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:17.468
How's fishing?

01:24:17.677 --> 01:24:20.262
Fine, Cody. Good catch.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:22.473
You like the truck idea, huh?

01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:24.808
It's admirable.

01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:29.229
We might all profit by a closer study
of classical literature.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.483
Mm-hm.

01:24:32.692 --> 01:24:35.861
Oh, chemical plant.
I guess that's Long Beach way.

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:38.781
That's close enough for now.
You know the way I work, Cody.

01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:41.992
I must ask that you don't insist
on knowing the exact location...

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:44.036
...until you've reached the rendezvous.

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:45.287
That's all right.

01:24:45.455 --> 01:24:48.916
The only thing that matters is
how much dough this joint has in the kitty.

01:24:49.125 --> 01:24:52.628
Four hundred and twenty-six thousand
dollars will be placed in their safe...

01:24:52.837 --> 01:24:54.421
...before closing time tomorrow...

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:58.050
...to be distributed to deserving employees
the following morning.

01:24:58.218 --> 01:25:02.304
Uh, provided there's no
unforeseen accident, of course.

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:05.933
- Like me and my boys?
- Exactly.

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.727
What are they doing, dancing?

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.063
Maybe they found
they went to school together.

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:15.651
- Say, maybe they're buddies after all.
- Well, something funny's going on there.

01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:21.031
I've had my eye on this place for months.

01:25:21.241 --> 01:25:24.993
Now, uh, these checking gates,
that means a pass for the driver...

01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:28.330
...identity cards and stuff. We're all hot.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.415
Your truck will be driven
past these checkers...

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.709
...by an ex-convict of my acquaintance.

01:25:32.919 --> 01:25:37.798
He's now leading a scrupulously honest life
as a truck driver for this very firm.

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.174
Oh, smooth.

01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:46.974
Sorry to bust in. We're finished.
Thought you might wanna check.

01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:49.184
- I'll be right out.
- Okay.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:53.188
- You having much luck, mister?
- I haven't started yet. I'm just on my way.

01:25:53.398 --> 01:25:56.024
- Oh. You done much fishing up here?
- Oh, every year.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:58.110
Yeah? What are you trying for?

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:00.571
Bass.

01:26:01.072 --> 01:26:03.574
- This guy's a phony, Cody.
- I beg your pardon?

01:26:03.783 --> 01:26:06.618
This is trout country.
There ain't bass for a hundred miles.

01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:11.748
What's so funny?

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:15.878
You're right on your toes, kid. Bass, heh.

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:17.337
He got you, didn't he?

01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:20.174
Trader, this is the kid
I've been telling you about.

01:26:20.383 --> 01:26:22.759
- Meet Vic Pardo.
- Hello.

01:26:23.094 --> 01:26:25.095
- Glad to know you, Mr., uh...
- Uh, forgive me, I...

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:28.807
Well, you can forget that.
Vic's my partner, fifty-fifty.

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.893
Cody Jarrett going fifty-fifty?

01:26:31.102 --> 01:26:34.479
- I split even with Ma, didn't I?
- I see.

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:38.859
My name's Daniel Winston.
San Diego. Uh, securities.

01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:40.527
Glad to know you, Mr. Winston.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.822
Sit down.

01:26:56.586 --> 01:26:58.754
Hold it. Where you going, Pardo?

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:26.198
- What's doing, kid?
- I don't like being pushed around.

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:29.618
- My orders was nobody was to leave.
- That might go for hoods like him.

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:33.705
- When I got a reason to leave, I leave.
- Nobody has reasons I don't know about.

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:37.042
- He jumped me, Cody.
- Get back on the job.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:41.755
That was pretty fancy wrestling, kid.
Where'd you learn it?

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:43.590
- In the Army.
- You're a liar.

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.384
They don't take cons in the Army.

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:48.428
When the war broke out,
I didn't have any record except kid stuff.

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:51.848
What were you doing just now, soldier?
Going over the hill?

01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:55.060
No. I figured maybe I'd run into L.A.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:57.729
Be back before anyone knew.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:02.067
- What's doing in L.A.?
- My wife. She don't know where I am.

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:04.653
When we crashed out,
I didn't leave no forwarding address.

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.154
Hmm.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:09.491
- It's the truth, Cody.
- Why didn't you ask me?

01:28:09.701 --> 01:28:11.827
I, uh, figured you might get sore.

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:15.330
- So you took off on your own, huh?
- I haven't seen her in a long time.

01:28:15.915 --> 01:28:19.793
I'm, uh...
I'm human, you know, like everyone else.

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:24.756
All right, kid.

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:27.551
All right.

01:28:31.097 --> 01:28:33.056
You're just lonesome.

01:28:33.266 --> 01:28:35.392
Lonesome, like me.

01:28:35.601 --> 01:28:37.185
You?

01:28:37.562 --> 01:28:38.729
What about...?

01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:40.105
- You mean Verna?
- Yeah.

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:45.319
All I ever had was Ma. And now...

01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:47.154
Your mother alive?

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:50.449
Uh, no, no.
She, uh, died before I even knew her.

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:57.414
I was, uh... I was just walking around
out there talking to mine.

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:02.377
- That sound funny to you?
- Oh, no. No.

01:29:04.213 --> 01:29:05.672
Some might think so.

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:08.342
Well, my old lady never had anything.

01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:12.220
Always on the run, always on the move.
Some life.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:15.807
First it was my old man,
died kicking and screaming in a outhouse...

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:20.020
...then my brother,
and after that, it was taking care of me.

01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:23.690
Always trying to put me on top.

01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.692
"Top of the world," she used to say.

01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:28.362
And then,
times when I'd be losing my grip...

01:29:28.571 --> 01:29:32.908
...there she'd be, right behind me,
pushing me back up again.

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:35.285
And now...

01:29:35.495 --> 01:29:38.789
Well, anyway, she quit running, Cody.

01:29:38.998 --> 01:29:41.291
Yeah. Quit running.

01:29:42.168 --> 01:29:46.797
That was, uh, a good feeling out there,
talking to her.

01:29:47.006 --> 01:29:49.091
Just me and Ma.

01:29:49.675 --> 01:29:52.552
A good feeling. I liked it.

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:57.349
Maybe I am nuts.

01:29:58.684 --> 01:30:01.103
Let's go in and have a drink.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:08.610
Tell you what, Vic.
Tell you what. I've got an idea.

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:12.114
We'll pick up your wife
after the job tomorrow...

01:30:12.323 --> 01:30:15.617
...and, uh, we'll all take a little trip,
just the four of us.

01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:17.786
No kidding, Cody.
Oh, that sounds great to me.

01:30:17.995 --> 01:30:21.623
You mean it, honey?
We could have fun. Live big.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:23.834
Money's just paper if you don't spend it.

01:30:24.043 --> 01:30:26.294
- That's an idea.
- It's a good idea.

01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:28.797
Europe, maybe. Paris.

01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:32.509
Rubbing shoulders with the best of them.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.761
How do you do, countess?

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:38.890
Sable coats,
jewels just dripping from my fingers.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:43.270
Oh, I'd knock their eyes out, Cody.
You'd be real proud of me.

01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:47.357
Don't go flipping your lid.

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:53.029
He ain't thought of a vacation in years, Vic.
Don't let him forget it.

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:55.365
Here's to us, top of the world.

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.368
Oh.

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:00.495
Um...

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:04.332
- How's the radio coming, Verna?
- A crystal set would play better.

01:31:04.542 --> 01:31:07.335
Yeah? Maybe I could fix it for you.

01:31:07.545 --> 01:31:11.173
- I wish you would. I'm dead without music.
- We'll get a new one.

01:31:11.382 --> 01:31:16.011
I don't mind fixing it, Cody.
Keep me busy. I, uh, can't sleep anyhow.

01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:17.721
Anything you say, kid.

01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:19.723
I was just gonna throw it away.

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:21.892
I'm not making you any promises,
remember.

01:31:22.101 --> 01:31:23.935
Well, I think we'd better hit the hay,
duchess.

01:31:24.103 --> 01:31:26.730
Come on. We got a heavy day tomorrow.

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:28.648
Vic.

01:31:32.195 --> 01:31:35.071
- See you in the morning.
- Right.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:40.911
Grab the brass ring.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:22.118
What are you doing? We're on our way.

01:32:22.328 --> 01:32:25.330
You gotta have a chain bounce
on the ground, get rid of electricity.

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:28.458
That's only when you got gasoline
or chemicals inside.

01:32:28.668 --> 01:32:32.212
You wanna have some traffic cop
think you got a load of something else?

01:32:32.421 --> 01:32:35.131
That's using your head, kid.
All right, snap it up.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.849
You all know what you're to do...

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:46.935
...and you know where the rendezvous is.

01:32:47.144 --> 01:32:49.271
We're to pick up our driver there at 5:00...

01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.774
...and we'll be at the plant
right after the day shift has checked off.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:55.277
Now, Vic and Tommy, we go in the truck.

01:32:55.486 --> 01:32:57.654
The rest of you go with Verna
in the sedan.

01:32:57.863 --> 01:32:59.197
And, baby...

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:02.450
...don't get picked up for speeding,
but get them there, huh?

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.871
Don't worry, honey. I'll get them there.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:40.447
Twelve thousand bucks and she's getting
ready to blow up in your face.

01:33:40.656 --> 01:33:43.241
Might be a cracked radiator.
We'd better stop somewhere.

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:45.577
There's a gas station down the hill, Cody.

01:33:45.745 --> 01:33:48.663
Hmm. Well, uh, pull in
and watch yourself.

01:33:57.882 --> 01:33:58.923
Fill her up?

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:02.510
- With water, bub. Check that radiator.
- Okay.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:08.099
- You got a washroom, mister?
- Yeah. Cleanest in the West.

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:12.896
Dry as a bone.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.588
Go get Vic. Hurry up.

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:52.811
- Cody says to hurry up.
- All right.

01:35:03.823 --> 01:35:07.701
- I thought you said cleanest in the West.
- You ever seen a cleaner one, mister?

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:09.869
The mirror's so dirty you can see double.

01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:11.746
What?

01:35:19.505 --> 01:35:23.717
Wise guys. Didn't even buy gas.

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:46.531
Into the wooden horse, boys.

01:35:48.367 --> 01:35:50.410
Where do we go, Trader?

01:35:53.164 --> 01:35:56.207
- Be back in three hours. I'll wait.
- We'll be here. Where's the driver?

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.376
Having a cup of coffee. He'll be right out.

01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:01.254
Well, Bo.

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:03.798
I heard you're on the straight and narrow,
driving a truck.

01:36:03.966 --> 01:36:05.508
Tonight I hand in my resignation.

01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:07.051
- Heh.
- You'd better get going.

01:36:07.219 --> 01:36:08.428
- All right.
- Good luck.

01:36:14.852 --> 01:36:17.896
Got it? Now, when you get to the plant,
park across the street.

01:36:18.105 --> 01:36:22.650
If there's any trouble,
give us the horn, hard, hmm? All right.

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:32.118
- How is it in there?
- Can't breathe good. Otherwise, fine.

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:33.411
Stop breathing.

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.622
Oh, uh, there's a button up in the cab.

01:36:35.831 --> 01:36:38.500
Press it once if trouble shows,
three times for all clear.

01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:40.084
Okay, I got it.

01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:06.820
Somebody's ribbing you, Russ.

01:37:07.029 --> 01:37:10.281
Take a slant at the mirror
in your washroom.

01:37:14.703 --> 01:37:17.247
"Radio Signal Fallon."
You know what that means, sir?

01:37:17.456 --> 01:37:19.374
You bet I know what it means. It's Hank.

01:37:19.583 --> 01:37:22.210
Call the FCC.
Get every direction-finder car they've got.

01:37:22.419 --> 01:37:24.963
Ask them to clear the air. Now, listen...

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:56.619
Got him.

01:37:57.621 --> 01:37:59.747
This is Car A at La Canada Verdugo.

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:02.750
Receiving signal, 105 degrees.
Will repeat.

01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:04.878
One-zero-five degrees.

01:38:05.087 --> 01:38:06.337
Check.

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:08.047
Come in, Car B.

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:10.300
Car B bearing 284 degrees.

01:38:17.683 --> 01:38:20.393
Maine and Atlantic, Alhambra.
General direction, southwest.

01:38:20.603 --> 01:38:24.522
Maine and Atlantic in Alhambra.
General direction, southwest.

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:27.650
Check. Source of signal,
Maine and Atlantic in Alhambra.

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:29.903
General direction, southwest.

01:38:30.112 --> 01:38:33.489
Head southwest.
Have Car B head southeast.

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:58.723
Car A at Western and Slauson,
bearing 158 degrees.

01:38:58.933 --> 01:39:05.772
Car B, Atlantic and Telegraph Road,
bearing 235 degrees.

01:39:12.655 --> 01:39:13.780
Imperial and Figueroa.

01:39:13.989 --> 01:39:16.783
Source of signal, Imperial and Figueroa.

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:29.253
Looks like the Long Beach area.

01:39:30.172 --> 01:39:35.259
Car A at Rosecrans and Western,
bearing 156 degrees.

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:41.349
Car B at Atlantic and Compton,
bearing 244 degrees.

01:39:45.938 --> 01:39:50.066
- Source of signal, 198th and Figueroa.
- 198th and Figueroa.

01:41:15.194 --> 01:41:16.611
Cover the back.

01:41:25.788 --> 01:41:29.457
Car A at 166th and Western,
bearing 138 degrees.

01:41:33.879 --> 01:41:39.926
Car B, Alameda
and Artesia, bearing 256 degrees.

01:41:44.723 --> 01:41:46.849
Same as before. 198th and Figueroa.

01:41:47.059 --> 01:41:49.477
They must have stopped.
198th and Figueroa.

01:41:49.686 --> 01:41:51.646
Check. 198th and Figueroa.

01:41:51.855 --> 01:41:56.025
That's it. Send out a call.
All cars proceed, 198th and Figueroa.

01:42:18.173 --> 01:42:19.882
Drop the gun.

01:42:22.386 --> 01:42:24.220
Now turn around.

01:42:42.573 --> 01:42:44.157
Go on.

01:43:37.878 --> 01:43:39.962
- Hey, Cody, that guy's a copper.
- What?

01:43:40.172 --> 01:43:43.216
He's a T-man. I know him.
His name is Fallon.

01:43:44.676 --> 01:43:46.886
- You sure?
- Yeah. He pinched me four years ago.

01:43:49.681 --> 01:43:51.891
Don't go for your guns.

01:43:54.311 --> 01:43:56.312
A copper.

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:59.190
A copper.

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:00.983
How do you like that, boys?

01:44:01.443 --> 01:44:04.695
A copper, and his name is Fallon.

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:09.992
And we went for it. I went for it.

01:44:10.202 --> 01:44:12.119
Treated him like a kid brother.

01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:16.624
And I was gonna split fifty-fifty
with a copper.

01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:21.254
Maybe they're waiting
to pin a medal on him.

01:44:21.463 --> 01:44:24.173
Solid gold. Now come on, get up.
Get your hands up.

01:44:24.341 --> 01:44:29.178
Heh, heh. Yeah, that's it.
A nice gold medal for the copper.

01:44:29.388 --> 01:44:33.015
Only maybe he's gonna get it
sooner than he thinks.

01:44:37.271 --> 01:44:40.064
Cody, the joint's crawling with cops.

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:52.118
- Let him have it.
- Oh, no, and lose our ace in the hole?

01:44:52.327 --> 01:44:54.996
He's gonna walk us out of here.
Ain't you, copper? Get up.

01:44:55.205 --> 01:44:58.916
- It won't work. They'll shoot just the same.
- They won't shoot one of their own.

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:01.794
- They won't make any deals.
- You better pray that they do.

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:05.423
Jarrett, you and your men
might as well give up.

01:45:06.174 --> 01:45:09.427
Jarrett, come out with your hands up.

01:45:14.182 --> 01:45:19.603
We've got your boy Fallon in here,
and he'll be all right if you do as I say.

01:45:21.690 --> 01:45:23.899
She says she can get Jarrett to come out.

01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:26.193
If I can, mister, will you go easy on me?

01:45:26.403 --> 01:45:29.864
I'll tell him you'll let him get away
because you don't want your guy hurt.

01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:33.826
He'll believe me. Then when he comes out,
you can do what you want with him.

01:45:34.036 --> 01:45:36.829
- No deal. Lock her up.
- You cheap copper.

01:45:37.831 --> 01:45:40.374
Jarrett, you haven't got a chance.

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:42.168
Come out with your hands up.

01:45:42.377 --> 01:45:44.795
"Come out with your hands up,"
the man says.

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:46.839
How do you like that, Ma? Heh.

01:45:47.049 --> 01:45:49.133
Here's my answer, you dirty...

01:45:54.639 --> 01:45:56.974
Fan out.
Give them the tear gas from both sides.

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.352
That was Cody Jarrett talking!

01:46:15.786 --> 01:46:18.204
Out this way, Cody. Through that door.

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:21.457
Here's yours, copper.

01:46:42.604 --> 01:46:43.979
Wait a minute. It's Fallon.

01:46:56.827 --> 01:46:59.912
- You all right, Hank?
- Quick, get a car to Charlie's Roadhouse.

01:47:00.122 --> 01:47:02.373
Highway 60, near Colton.
Pick up Daniel Winston.

01:47:02.541 --> 01:47:04.250
He's the guy you're looking for.
Your fence.

01:47:04.418 --> 01:47:05.751
Benny.

01:47:06.670 --> 01:47:09.088
- What's out here, Bo?
- An alley.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.757
Hey, Happy, try it.

01:47:11.967 --> 01:47:15.636
Come on. Get going. Get out there.

01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:24.580
We got Bo Creel. They're heading up.

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:12.253
On the ground heading
for the Horton Sphere area.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.546
Send men to that section.

01:49:37.195 --> 01:49:39.572
Pass word along.
Don't fire unless you've got a perfect target.

01:49:39.739 --> 01:49:42.074
That place is a stack of dynamite.

01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:52.710
Have that area surrounded.
Get some searchlights.

01:50:23.408 --> 01:50:26.118
They think they've got Cody Jarrett.

01:50:26.536 --> 01:50:29.997
They haven't got Cody Jarrett, you hear?
They haven't got him.

01:50:30.206 --> 01:50:32.750
And I'm gonna show you
they haven't got him.

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:34.877
Come on. Come with me.

01:50:58.943 --> 01:51:03.322
Don't shoot. It's me, Ryley.
I'm coming out!

01:51:05.784 --> 01:51:07.701
Don't shoot!

01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:35.062
You might as well come down,
Jarrett. There's no one left but you.

01:51:35.271 --> 01:51:38.148
Ha, ha. Come and get me!

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:46.240
Get the gun, Hank.

01:52:12.642 --> 01:52:14.768
What's holding him up?

01:52:44.799 --> 01:52:48.469
Made it, Ma! Top of the world!

01:53:02.859 --> 01:53:04.818
Cody Jarrett.

01:53:06.321 --> 01:53:11.158
He finally got to the top of the world,
and it blew right up in his face.

01:53:20.585 --> 01:53:22.586
