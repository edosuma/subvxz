00:50.918 --> 00:52.720
( audience laughing )

00:52.786 --> 00:54.522
I... I actually--

00:54.588 --> 00:55.823
I've been having
a lot of trouble sleeping,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.125
as we all should,

00:57.191 --> 00:59.593
and, uh...

00:59.660 --> 01:01.129
I don't know,
you don't live that long.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.297
It doesn't matter.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.600
I mean,
life isn't that long.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.902
80-some years.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.772
Buy some shit, use it,
it breaks.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.242
Try to ( bleep ) somebody.

01:14.308 --> 01:17.611
Hope your shit doesn't--
shits don't hurt too bad.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.680
( laughing )

01:21.949 --> 01:23.551
I'm 44 now.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.753
You start doing that math,
and it's happy math now.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.188
Like, when you're
in your 20s, you're like,

01:27.255 --> 01:28.656
"How long will my life seem ?

01:28.722 --> 01:30.691
"I hope it seems like a nice,
long story

01:30.758 --> 01:34.995
and I don't-- I don't
feel like I died too soon."

01:35.062 --> 01:36.430
You get to your 40s,
you're like,

01:36.497 --> 01:37.731
"I'm not--
I'm almost there, man.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.767
All right, yeah."

01:39.833 --> 01:40.868
( audience laughing )

01:56.950 --> 01:57.385
( no sound )

02:04.992 --> 02:09.830
( no sound )

02:13.734 --> 02:15.503
( no sound )

02:53.241 --> 02:54.808
Can I help you?

02:54.875 --> 02:57.345
Yeah, y'know, I'm--
I'm looking for-- for Liz.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.512
She-- she works here.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.880
Not anymore,
she quit.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.382
Anything else?

03:01.449 --> 03:02.816
No, that's it.
Okay.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.654
I think that's the girl
whose job I got.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.892
I just started here.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.561
Oh.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.263
Is she, like, a friend of
yours or something

03:15.329 --> 03:17.665
or a girlfriend?

03:17.731 --> 03:18.932
Not either, really.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.534
But you liked her.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.102
Uh...

03:22.169 --> 03:23.737
Well, I only went out
with her once

03:23.804 --> 03:25.339
and we-- I never got
her number or anything.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.708
You liked her.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.109
Yeah.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.279
I did, I really--
I really liked her.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.813
Well, you should find her.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.416
I don't really
know how, y'know--
No.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.117
You should see her.

03:37.184 --> 03:40.354
I mean, you just have
to find her.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.023
Yeah, well, thank you,
thanks a lot.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.626
Do you want me
to help you?

03:45.693 --> 03:47.094
I mean, I can
look in the files.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.496
She worked here.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.264
I don't know,
that's-- that's kind of--

03:50.331 --> 03:52.633
Come on, it's romantic.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.968
I mean, I wanna help
a romantic thing happen.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.308
I don't know,
if you could do that,

04:00.374 --> 04:02.042
if you had a way to--
Hold on.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.677
Okay.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.361
Why aren't you at
the counter?
Nothing.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.963
Okay, please get back
to work.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.332
Okay.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.412
I almost got in trouble.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.047
Oh, Jesus!
No, it's okay.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.081
It was fun.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.016
This job is boring.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.519
Anyway, sorry
I couldn't get any info.
It's all right.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.288
Do you know her
last name?
No, I don't.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.757
But, you know what,

04:49.823 --> 04:51.091
I think maybe this
just isn't meant to be.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.993
No. Make it meant to be.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.397
Do you know anything
about her besides her name?

04:57.765 --> 04:59.232
Well, I know where
she lives but...

04:59.299 --> 05:00.634
Oh, my God!

05:00.701 --> 05:02.269
Well, go there,
go to where she lives.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.171
I can't stalk her
at her building.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.539
It doesn't have to
be stalking.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.342
You just go there
and find things out.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.844
I don't know,
I'm not that kind of person.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.212
It's--
Well, I am.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.114
I totally do things
like that.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.849
You do?
Yeah, it's fun!

05:19.653 --> 05:21.855
Do you want me
to go with you?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.925
I get off in 20 minutes.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.694
I know I'm weird
but...

05:26.760 --> 05:28.095
come on, what are
you gonna do otherwise?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.797
Just go home and give up?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.436
Meet me out front
in 20 minutes.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.644
Hi.
Hey.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.278
So where
does she live?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.547
Uh, this way.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.390
That's it?

05:56.457 --> 05:58.091
That's-- Yeah, I dropped her
off there

05:58.158 --> 05:59.292
and we said good night.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.194
That's the last time
I saw her.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.263
Did you kiss?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.165
Was it nice?
Why didn't you go in?

06:05.232 --> 06:06.133
Well, it wasn't really
like that.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.835
I-- I don't know,

06:07.901 --> 06:10.404
it wasn't like any date
I've been on before.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.841
She changed how I feel
about everything...

06:13.907 --> 06:15.643
in one night.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.077
And then at the end,
I don't know, it just--

06:17.144 --> 06:20.047
it got kind of-- she just got
really sad and, uh...

06:20.113 --> 06:21.248
It's hard to describe.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.150
What does she
look like?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.752
Oh, I don't--
Dark hair--

06:24.818 --> 06:26.454
I'm not good
at describing people.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.321
Maybe 32 years old.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.490
Where are you going?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.459
Where are you going?

06:31.525 --> 06:32.926
What--
( horn honking )

06:43.203 --> 06:45.305
Hi.
Hi.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.974
I'm looking for
my friend, Liz.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.443
She's in Apartment...

06:49.510 --> 06:51.445
Oh, I'm so stupid.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.214
Uh... Apartment 9?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.517
Liz, dark hair,
she's about 32.

06:56.584 --> 06:58.986
I need a last name.
Oh, come on.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.121
You know her, right?

07:01.188 --> 07:02.523
I think
it's Apartment 9.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.757
She has dark hair.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.326
I gotta have
a last name.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.462
She's your friend,
you don't know her name?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.197
Look, I'm just trying to
come and see my friend.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.565
Why are you
being like that?

07:11.632 --> 07:14.067
It's my job.
No, it's not.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.403
She'll be so pissed if you
didn't let me reach her.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.238
Look, I never
saw you before, so--

07:18.305 --> 07:19.640
So what?

07:19.707 --> 07:22.510
I have to find Liz!

07:22.576 --> 07:24.578
Why don't you call her
and tell her to come down

07:24.645 --> 07:27.380
or ask her for her
last name?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.716
Thank you very much.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.688
Jesus Christ.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.228
The doorman's
a total asshole.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.796
Okay, well,
maybe let's just--

07:42.863 --> 07:44.031
Do you wanna go inside
somewhere?

07:44.097 --> 07:46.266
It's so cold.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.935
All right, sure.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.208
You're not gonna
give up, are you?

07:56.944 --> 07:58.779
I kind of think
I have to.

07:58.846 --> 08:00.380
Why?

08:00.447 --> 08:01.682
I just don't think
this was meant to--

08:01.749 --> 08:03.851
Oh, that's bullshit.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.587
I think that "it wasn't
meant to be" is bullshit.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.922
You're tested in life,
you know?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.490
Things just aren't
put in front of you

08:10.558 --> 08:11.825
for the taking.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.126
You have to go through
something

08:13.193 --> 08:14.595
to get what you want.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.063
You can't just
drift through life

08:16.129 --> 08:18.632
and hope that love is just
gonna flow into you

08:18.699 --> 08:21.268
like plankton into
a whale's ( bleep ) mouth.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.170
You have to prove yourself.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.838
You have to make things
happen and choose.

08:27.474 --> 08:29.977
Well, there's nothing
really that I can--
Well, I have a cousin

08:30.043 --> 08:32.045
who works for an insurance
company-- he can find people.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.647
I can call him.

08:33.714 --> 08:34.915
I'm not doing anything
like that.
Why?

08:34.982 --> 08:36.784
It's nothing
for me to call him.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.351
He does it all the time.
That's a person's privacy--

08:38.418 --> 08:39.653
That's stupid!

08:39.720 --> 08:40.854
You could
totally find her.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.892
You could find her!

08:48.428 --> 08:50.631
( clattering )

08:50.698 --> 08:51.965
What are you doing?

08:56.469 --> 08:59.239
( moaning )

09:06.814 --> 09:08.982
( grunting loudly )
Shh, shh...

09:09.049 --> 09:11.151
( moaning )

09:12.586 --> 09:15.488
( moaning continues )

09:15.555 --> 09:17.925
( panting )

09:31.138 --> 09:33.106
Just so you know...

09:33.173 --> 09:34.207
I'm married,

09:34.274 --> 09:36.209
so please don't come by
the store or anything.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.057
( sighing )

10:13.546 --> 10:15.382
Daddy!
Hey.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.984
How are you?
Good.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.820
Where's your sister?
I don't know.

10:19.887 --> 10:22.055
We gotta find her
so we can get out of here.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.891
I'm going home
with you today?
Yeah.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.730
Daddy, I wanna take
a new kind of class.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.765
What kind of-- what are
you talking about?

10:31.832 --> 10:32.833
I don't know.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.868
Just a new kind.
Uh-huh.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.446
Can you help me
move some chairs?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.515
Huh, what?

10:48.581 --> 10:50.718
I've gotta get 15 chairs
to the fifth floor.
Oh, no, I can't.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.152
I-- yeah, I can't--
sorry.
Why not?

10:52.219 --> 10:54.054
Do not give me that look,
do not...

10:54.121 --> 10:56.089
We need parents
to get involved.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.825
There's been so many
budget cuts...

11:00.093 --> 11:01.194
There's a...

11:01.261 --> 11:02.595
Children...

11:02.662 --> 11:05.265
Parents...
There are nerds...

11:07.801 --> 11:09.169
... be part of
the community...

11:11.038 --> 11:12.906
You're a nerd,
aren't you?
( girl )
Yeah.

11:15.242 --> 11:17.778
Hey, Lilly...

11:17.845 --> 11:19.112
What's the matter,
are you okay?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.580
What happened?

11:20.647 --> 11:22.315
Honey, what happened,
are you all right?

11:22.382 --> 11:23.416
Are you all right?

11:31.058 --> 11:34.061
Hey, listen, if you're upset
about something,

11:34.127 --> 11:36.396
you can talk to me
and I'll-- I'll listen.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.166
I don't wanna say anything
for you to listen to.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.270
( bell dinging )
Hey, come on, come on.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.238
Let's get out here, let's get
out here, let's get out here.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.539
Why?
This isn't home.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.408
I know, let's just go,
come on!

11:48.475 --> 11:51.779
( carousel music playing )

12:02.555 --> 12:03.656
Hey, you want
an ice cream?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.225
Yay, ice cream!

12:05.292 --> 12:06.760
You shouldn't buy us
so many treats.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.695
Mom, would be upset.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.530
Hey, man, I'm just trying to
cheer you up.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.065
I don't wanna be
cheered up.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.775
Okay, everybody,
do your homework.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.343
I always do
my homework!

12:24.644 --> 12:26.113
Hey!

12:26.179 --> 12:27.915
Hey!

12:27.981 --> 12:30.050
Listen, I'm really sorry if
something happened to you

12:30.117 --> 12:31.384
at school today and upset you

12:31.451 --> 12:33.153
but I know I didn't
do anything to you.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.721
Okay, and you're acting
really crappy towards me

12:34.788 --> 12:35.989
and towards your
sister too, frankly.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.490
I don't mind
how she's being.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.393
Okay!

12:41.661 --> 12:42.963
Fine.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.131
( door slamming )

12:48.568 --> 12:49.502
Thanks a lot.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.240
( knocking )

12:55.008 --> 12:58.445
( Jane )
Daddy, how long are you
gonna be in there?

12:58.511 --> 12:59.779
As long
as I have to be.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.614
Daddy, I need to
tell you something.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.550
No, you don't.
Please!

13:26.506 --> 13:28.275
Hey.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.576
What you doing?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.079
Oh, drawing.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.347
Good.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.316
I'm sorry I lost
my patience earlier.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.517
That's fine.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.519
No, it's not,
but thank you.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.888
Where's Lilly?

13:40.954 --> 13:43.656
Oh, she left.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.325
What do you mean?

13:46.894 --> 13:48.896
She went out.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.842
Jane, where's Lilly?

14:02.910 --> 14:04.644
She left.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.881
You mean she left
the apartment?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.850
Uh, yeah, that's what
I wanted to tell you.

14:10.918 --> 14:12.953
Jane...

14:13.020 --> 14:16.489
Jane, Lilly can't
go out by herself.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.858
Jane!
She left.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.327
Lilly!

14:24.364 --> 14:25.465
Lilly!

14:28.501 --> 14:30.770
Lilly.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.106
Lilly, where are you?

14:33.173 --> 14:34.474
Lilly.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.878
Lilly!

14:43.083 --> 14:44.784
Where is she?
Really, where is she?

14:44.851 --> 14:46.753
Where is she, really?
I'm not kidding.

14:46.819 --> 14:47.921
Where is she?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.489
I just said she left.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.125
Lilly!

14:57.597 --> 14:58.665
Lilly!

15:03.470 --> 15:05.005
Lilly, Lilly!

15:05.072 --> 15:08.008
Oh, shit, shit!

15:08.075 --> 15:10.177
Go inside, go inside.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.379
I don't wanna be alone.
Go back...

15:16.616 --> 15:19.219
( man )
Keep your voice down.
( man )
Don't you walk away from me!

15:19.286 --> 15:21.221
Keep your voice down!
Don't walk away from me,
asshole!

15:21.288 --> 15:23.556
I trusted you!
You lied to me!
I'm sorry...

15:23.623 --> 15:25.058
I gave you everything!

15:25.125 --> 15:26.359
Mi amor, dame un segundo,
dame un segundo--

15:26.426 --> 15:28.695
How many?

15:28.761 --> 15:29.662
No, don't talk in
Spanish to me.
My daughter's missing,
my oldest daughter--

15:29.729 --> 15:31.698
She's not here.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.765
What have you taken from?
I'm sorry, I can't now.

15:32.832 --> 15:33.866
Thank you.
Look at me!

15:33.933 --> 15:36.003
Look at me!
What?!

15:45.645 --> 15:47.747
Honey, go put on a jacket,
go put on a jacket.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.149
Okay, Daddy.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.288
Lilly!

15:57.357 --> 15:58.325
Lilly!

16:09.136 --> 16:10.737
( Jane )
Daddy!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.372
Daddy.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.307
Daddy... Daddy.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.178
Daddy, what are you
gonna do?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.715
Daddy, what are you
gonna do?

16:22.782 --> 16:25.185
I don't know, I can't...

16:25.252 --> 16:27.587
I can't leave the building
because she could come back.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.158
You gonna call Mama?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.095
No.
You're not?

16:38.165 --> 16:39.866
Lilly!
Lilly!

16:39.932 --> 16:41.801
Lilly!
Lilly!

16:41.868 --> 16:47.640
( speaking in Slovenian )

16:47.707 --> 16:49.442
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
what is-- what is that?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.511
Hey, hey, what is that,
what are you saying?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.446
Slovenian.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.782
My friend Malkus in school
is teaching me.

16:58.751 --> 16:59.852
Well, he...

16:59.919 --> 17:01.121
Lilly!

17:08.861 --> 17:10.830
How old is Lilly?

17:10.897 --> 17:12.632
She's ten years old.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.234
She lives here
with you?

17:14.301 --> 17:16.636
Well, I, uh,
share custody with their mom,

17:16.703 --> 17:19.106
so half the time they live
here-- half the time.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.873
Where's the mother?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.343
I guess she's home.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.145
But she's aware that your
daughter's missing?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.251
Wait, you called us but you
haven't called the mother?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.188
( sighing )

17:35.255 --> 17:36.656
You wanna go ahead
and make that call now?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.125
Yeah.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.595
Daddy, this isn't
your fault.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.532
Lilly shouldn't
have left like that.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.134
Thank you, baby.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.006
Hi, uh, it's,
uh, Louie, hi.

17:54.073 --> 17:58.010
Uh... how are you?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.180
Listen,
I gotta tell you...

18:09.456 --> 18:10.590
Um...

18:12.091 --> 18:13.426
I gotta call you back.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.430
Who was that?

18:17.497 --> 18:19.799
That was Lilly.
Lilly?

18:19.866 --> 18:22.635
The girl?
Yeah.
Let's go.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.204
( sighing )

18:29.075 --> 18:31.644
Daddy, why are
the police here?

18:31.711 --> 18:33.646
Where have you been?!

18:33.713 --> 18:34.981
In the closet.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.184
I read in there
sometimes.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.718
You didn't look in
the closet?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.154
You said that she left.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.555
Thought she left.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.856
What, now you're gonna
pin this on her?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.858
Look...

18:45.925 --> 18:47.760
I'm sorry, uh...

18:47.827 --> 18:49.696
that I, um...

18:49.762 --> 18:50.763
Thank you for coming.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.202
I... Thank you for
you help, um...

18:57.170 --> 18:59.239
Hey, Daddy.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.341
I'm sorry how I was
acting before.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.177
I was in a bad mood.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.479
It's okay.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.549
Go get ready for bed,
okay?

19:09.616 --> 19:11.484
Everybody, get ready
for bed, please?

19:13.119 --> 19:14.187
( Jane groaning )

19:14.254 --> 19:15.388
Good night, Daddy.

19:17.724 --> 19:18.658
( sighing )

19:22.462 --> 19:24.397
Try to keep your kids safe,
that's a big--

19:24.464 --> 19:25.532
And if you
don't do it perfectly,

19:25.598 --> 19:27.434
then why do you do it at all?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.135
It's like this thing
that starts to dawn on you.

19:29.202 --> 19:31.338
Like, if my kids get in the car
with me, they have to buckle up.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.972
I make a big deal out of--

19:33.039 --> 19:34.274
"I'm not even
starting this car

19:34.341 --> 19:35.608
until you buckle your
seat belts."

19:35.675 --> 19:37.710
And if we get in
a taxi, I'm like,

19:37.777 --> 19:39.078
"Just-- It's fine.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.680
"Taxis are magic.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.181
"Nobody dies.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.884
Just get in, just go."

19:44.951 --> 19:48.120
There's-- I'm not digging in
the seat for a belt.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.690
There's no way
I'm blindly

19:50.757 --> 19:53.693
digging into the
Egyptian hepatitis

19:53.760 --> 19:57.630
and severed toes...

19:57.697 --> 19:59.599
so that you can have
a seat belt.

19:59.666 --> 20:04.003
You gotta put on your own mask
before helping the others.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.938
I'm not going through that.

20:06.005 --> 20:10.743
So my kids get in a cab and they
just hurtle through space

20:10.810 --> 20:15.214
at a speed determined
by the profit motive

20:15.282 --> 20:18.851
of a exhausted man...

20:18.918 --> 20:23.723
from another country where
life is shit cheap.

20:23.790 --> 20:27.294
Where kids die
all day and it's boring.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.396
( audience laughing )
