WEBVTT

01:23.667 --> 01:26.128
<i>No, no, no. Por favor, no--</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:30.757
<i>No. No!</i>

01:30.757 --> 01:32.718
Hey! <i>Rápido, rápido! Vamos, vamos!</i>

01:48.984 --> 01:50.569
<i>Silencio.</i>

02:08.794 --> 02:12.633
God, please help us. Please, God.
Dear Heavenly Father, please--

02:29.942 --> 02:33.195
I know. Oh, my God. I know. So pretty.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.074
I just feel like I can't breathe.
-Okay.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.242
All right, well...
-A little bit.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.869
...maybe just take small breaths.
Just like-- In and out.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.955
Dress is compressing my diaphragm,
you guys.

02:42.955 --> 02:45.832
It's like somebody stole my oxygen.
-Just breathe. Small breaths.

02:55.300 --> 03:00.389
Okay, Amber,
you are perfect, and it is three o'clock.

03:00.389 --> 03:01.598
I need a Valium.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.893
Actually, I need my brother.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.979
Okay. Really?
-We can do that.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.731
Yeah, I just need a second--
Need a minute with my brother.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.442
Yeah, let's do it.
-We'll be right there.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.944
Let's go, girls.
-Thank you.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.243
All good?
-Yeah. I mean...

03:22.411 --> 03:23.745
They're always late.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.924
Give me a minute. All good.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.426
Everything all right?
-Yeah.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.481
Wow.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.361
Thanks.

04:04.494 --> 04:07.956
I just need you to tell me this is real.
It's gonna last.

04:08.790 --> 04:13.462
Well, nothing lasts forever,
and he is your first husband.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.756
That's a good point. Yeah.

04:18.132 --> 04:22.095
But it's real. It's love. It's happiness.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.975
That's it, Bug. You did it.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.102
I know.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.899
But, like,
I'm not missing something, right?

04:35.192 --> 04:37.277
Yeah, we're different. Our values--

04:37.277 --> 04:40.447
<i>Prince doesn't like family.
He only sees his dad once a year.</i>

04:40.447 --> 04:42.658
<i>He hasn't talked to his mother in forever.</i>

04:42.658 --> 04:44.618
Amber, baby...

04:47.371 --> 04:51.083
I'm not worried for you two.
I mean, he's good to you, no?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.421
Prince is a guy
who's used to getting what he wants.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.841
You've got spine.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.426
It's gonna be a real marriage of equals.

05:03.512 --> 05:06.473
You know how much I love you, right?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.896
Nothing's gonna change here.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.315
It's always been you and me.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.402
Yeah.
-Yeah.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.029
And Mom.

05:30.372 --> 05:35.377
Okay. If I throw you over my shoulder,
this dress will wrinkle.

05:35.878 --> 05:36.962
Okay.
-Okay?

05:38.213 --> 05:39.715
Let's go.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.223
Wait.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.142
What?

05:50.142 --> 05:51.310
One thing's different.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.814
He's not just another guy in your unit.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.026
You need to bring him back to me.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.988
He comes home.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.116
Yes or no?

06:06.909 --> 06:07.993
I hear you, Bug.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.788
Okay.
-Okay.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.859
What can I tell you, son?
Happy wife, happy life.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.277
Isn't that right?

06:42.277 --> 06:44.655
Congratulations, bud. Great ceremony.
-Hey. Thanks, man.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.698
Well, that's pretty rich coming from you.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.076
Well, after three tries,
trust me, I'm an expert.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.244
Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.094
Yeah, man. Welcome to the family.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.637
I know I'm not your father,

07:09.263 --> 07:13.392
but I would like the honor of stepping in
for him today and having this dance.

07:13.392 --> 07:15.602
Would that be possible?
-Yes.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.688
I'll be back, hon.
-Excellent.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.607
Anything you need today,

07:21.191 --> 07:22.609
I'm your man, okay?
-Thank you.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.401
Hey, John, I need the keys to number two.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.153
Yeah, we got that up here for him already.

08:12.826 --> 08:13.994
What's going on, Mom?

08:15.621 --> 08:17.748
Fresh air. Taking it all in.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.501
Enjoying the party?

08:21.502 --> 08:24.463
Not my people.
They don't want me to participate.

08:27.257 --> 08:31.637
Maybe for your daughter's sake,
fake it as a normal person.

08:31.637 --> 08:32.721
Lay off the drugs.

08:33.222 --> 08:36.683
Or maybe you have a drink.
Might improve your personality.

08:37.808 --> 08:40.938
Now get back in there and do your job.
Take care of your sister.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.900
You're probably boiling up inside.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.487
She married your rich friend.
You still got a job to do.

08:48.987 --> 08:52.366
<i>You make sure he doesn't start
treating her like a piece of property.</i>

08:53.825 --> 08:56.036
Is it too soon to talk about a baby?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.664
It probably is, right? Yeah, maybe--
-Maybe wait till after the wedding?

08:58.664 --> 09:01.667
Or maybe we should--
Yeah, we can wait till tomorrow.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.127
I mean, I'm kidding. I mean, I'm not...

09:04.711 --> 09:06.672
He's a deliberate man.
-Yeah.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.257
He likes to think it through.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.927
But the clock is ticking
on the Senate run too.

09:11.927 --> 09:16.515
There's nothing more irresistible
than a war hero with a young family.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.393
I don't want the window to close
on that opportunity.

09:27.651 --> 09:32.197
Does this remind you of our wedding?
-Nope. A lot of important people here.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.616
You're pretty important too.
-Yeah?

09:34.616 --> 09:38.203
You're their leader.
All your boys are growing up.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.377
Son, cut in.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.888
Can I get some water, please?

09:58.056 --> 10:00.392
Brother-in-law, right?
-I am now.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.186
Yeah, Roy Leonard.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.313
Alex Chesborough. Call me "Bambi."

10:04.313 --> 10:05.981
Bambi?
-That's right.

10:07.149 --> 10:10.277
Prince tells me you're
ex-New Zealand group?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.279
Yeah. That was back in the day, mate.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.656
You know the story.
We ate snakes in the jungle.

10:14.656 --> 10:17.618
Yeah. Heard that one.
It tastes like chicken, right?

11:13.549 --> 11:15.634
It's an important step in a man's life

11:16.301 --> 11:18.679
when you take a wife and start a family.
Right?

11:18.679 --> 11:23.183
Nurturing others, not just yourself.
That's the true mark of manhood.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.519
Yeah. Cheers to that.
-But remember,

11:26.520 --> 11:29.147
this is the only family you can call
at two o'clock in the morning,

11:29.147 --> 11:32.401
say, "I'm fucked up, I crashed the car,
and there's a body in the trunk."

11:33.694 --> 11:36.488
And we're not gonna ask why.
We're gonna say, "What do you need?"

11:37.364 --> 11:39.533
Unless you split with my sister.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.285
Nah, then we'll just shoot you.

11:42.661 --> 11:43.871
A couple times.

11:45.289 --> 11:47.165
Well, to murder.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.876
Murder.
-Murder.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.350
Yes, sir?

12:10.981 --> 12:11.982
Roger that.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.363
Prince!

12:19.198 --> 12:21.033
Yo, Drifter. Brother!

12:22.743 --> 12:24.369
We got a flyaway.
-Fuck.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.538
You have fun tonight.
I'll see you in the morning.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.541
Love you, brother.

12:52.898 --> 12:56.193
Listen up.
We gotta be wheels up in eight hours.

12:57.152 --> 13:00.322
We're gonna grab a couple of our own.
No more boozing.

13:01.073 --> 13:02.115
Yes, sir.
-Copy.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.242
Let's roll.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.353
Hey, now you are my North Star.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.274
Like a navigation point?

13:36.358 --> 13:39.111
Like a GPS?
-No.

13:39.111 --> 13:43.490
A nice human computer bringing you home.
-No. Like the sun. Like the moon.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.035
You're the whole universe.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.206
I love you.

13:51.707 --> 13:52.708
I love you.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.427
Babe?

14:06.847 --> 14:08.015
We have a flyaway...

14:10.058 --> 14:11.059
tomorrow.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.644
Tomorrow?

14:15.564 --> 14:17.149
Yeah.
-It's already tomorrow.

14:17.149 --> 14:21.028
I'm so sorry. Hostage rescue.

14:25.574 --> 14:26.825
I'm so sorry.

14:59.483 --> 15:01.360
I have to be on base at 0800.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.322
They let me have the night.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.576
Well...

15:15.707 --> 15:16.959
gives us six hours.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.396
<i>Systems are good.</i>
-<i>...good.</i>

16:20.189 --> 16:22.441
<i>Copy. LZ is three minutes out.</i>

16:24.526 --> 16:26.528
<i>If it gets much worse
then we have to abort.</i>

16:26.528 --> 16:28.363
<i>Copy.</i>
-<i>Starting our approach.</i>

16:37.164 --> 16:38.749
<i>ISR has the LZ.</i>

16:40.709 --> 16:42.336
<i>Copy. LZ is clear.</i>

16:43.295 --> 16:44.838
<i>One minute out.</i>
-<i>One minute!</i>

16:44.838 --> 16:46.381
One minute.
-One minute.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.759
One minute.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.260
<i>Starting our approach.</i>

16:59.144 --> 17:00.646
We're approaching the LZ.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.857
Roger. You should have
ISR coverage in 30 seconds.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.984
<i>Have eyes on in 30 seconds.</i>
-Thirty seconds!

17:06.984 --> 17:08.487
Thirty seconds!

17:08.487 --> 17:12.824
<i>Three, two, one. Doors open.</i>

17:14.451 --> 17:15.743
<i>Doors open.</i>

17:19.039 --> 17:20.040
<i>Anything?</i>

17:20.707 --> 17:21.916
Visibility is degrading.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.044
<i>Lay low.</i>

17:24.044 --> 17:25.838
Ropes, ropes, ropes.

17:25.838 --> 17:27.714
<i>Copy. Ropes coming out on the left side.</i>

17:31.176 --> 17:33.178
<i>First rope is going out.</i>
-Copy.

17:38.141 --> 17:39.393
Prince, wait.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.186
This isn't right. Something's wrong.

17:41.186 --> 17:45.315
The drone is over the wrong mountain.
This LZ is not clear.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.942
Get that fucking drone
over the right mountain.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.694
<i>Yes, sir. Moving in now.</i>

17:49.403 --> 17:51.905
<i>Moving down.</i>
-<i>There's movement on the ground.</i>

17:56.243 --> 17:57.911
<i>Taking fire! We're taking fire!</i>

17:59.872 --> 18:01.540
<i>Ridgeline. Ridgeline!</i>

18:02.583 --> 18:05.460
Prince is on the rope!
Prince is on the rope!

18:13.427 --> 18:15.804
<i>Okay,
we still have an operator on the rope.</i>

18:15.804 --> 18:17.181
<i>He's off. He's off.</i>

18:21.560 --> 18:23.145
<i>Prince, are you all right?</i>

18:24.646 --> 18:25.647
I'm good.

18:25.647 --> 18:28.358
<i>Abort! Abort!</i>
-We've got a man down there!

18:28.358 --> 18:31.653
<i>The bird's damaged.
We've gotta go back to base and transload.</i>

18:40.162 --> 18:41.914
Then put me down right here!

18:41.914 --> 18:45.250
<i>You're 1,000 feet of elevation
and half a klick from the target.</i>

18:45.751 --> 18:47.294
<i>The snow looks pretty soft.</i>

18:47.794 --> 18:49.254
<i>Roger that.</i>

18:59.640 --> 19:01.433
<i>Troops are clear. Troops are clear.</i>

19:02.059 --> 19:03.560
Copy that. Let's go.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.486
What's the plan? Do you have me?

19:13.111 --> 19:15.280
<i>We're being reinserted half a klick away,</i>

19:15.280 --> 19:16.615
<i>and we're climbing back up.</i>

19:16.615 --> 19:17.699
<i>Roger.</i>

19:33.382 --> 19:35.717
Good thing
we left our snowshoes on the bird.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.430
The hostages are coming down to you.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.272
They're coming down to us.

20:30.272 --> 20:33.692
Might have to choose between getting
the hostages and going for Prince.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.277
That's easy. We get our guy.

20:35.277 --> 20:38.071
No, mission first.
Prince will have to wait.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.884
Let's set up right here.
They'll walk right to us.

21:02.763 --> 21:05.015
Prince, you good?

21:06.767 --> 21:09.019
I'm good, but not for much longer.

21:40.008 --> 21:43.095
This is bullshit. We're sitting here,
playing commando,

21:43.095 --> 21:45.055
<i>while Prince is up there by himself.</i>

22:14.126 --> 22:15.794
Prince?
-<i>I'm good. I'm good.</i>

22:15.794 --> 22:16.879
Hang tight.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.994
Journalists! Don't shoot!

22:49.995 --> 22:51.955
Don't shoot! Journalists!

22:51.955 --> 22:55.542
US rescue force!
-USA! We're rescue force. You're safe.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.960
Command, package secure.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.631
Roger. Gunship had to pull off because
of daylight. Stand by for QRF inbound.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.007
Get 'em down to the bird.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.092
<i>We also have movement
coming up the mountain.</i>

23:05.636 --> 23:09.431
Drifter, I gotta get Prince.
-Okay.

23:09.431 --> 23:10.682
<i>We're going for Prince.</i>

23:10.682 --> 23:13.519
Drifter, we cannot get
any fixed-wing support in there right now.

23:13.519 --> 23:15.229
Prince is alone up there.

23:16.063 --> 23:17.064
On me.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.309
I got eyes on our guy.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.563
Prince, we have a visual on you, brother.

24:08.407 --> 24:11.285
Guys, we've got a bunker up there
with a heavy machine gun.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.287
<i>I'm not going to be able to get to you.</i>

24:13.287 --> 24:14.705
<i>You've gotta clear that first.</i>

24:16.832 --> 24:20.169
<i>Triple, we gotta leave our own base
and fire so we can get him across.</i>

24:20.169 --> 24:22.629
We've gotta flank 'em.
-Copy that.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.841
Bambi, you cover our movements.
-Copy that.

24:26.592 --> 24:28.677
<i>Stay there, Prince.</i>
-<i>Roger.</i>

24:49.656 --> 24:50.991
<i>Drifter, you're clear.</i>

25:02.961 --> 25:04.213
Bunker's cleared.

25:04.213 --> 25:06.298
Roger. Moving across.

25:06.298 --> 25:08.383
<i>Bambi, I'm coming back down to you.</i>

25:11.678 --> 25:13.096
Drifter!

25:15.807 --> 25:17.809
<i>We got another fighter up there.</i>

25:17.809 --> 25:19.102
<i>Drifter is down.</i>

25:19.102 --> 25:21.813
<i>Bambi, go to him. Go to him!</i>
-<i>I'm moving!</i>

25:26.860 --> 25:27.861
I'm hit!

25:29.655 --> 25:31.031
Oh, fuck.

25:31.031 --> 25:32.199
<i>You okay?</i>

25:32.199 --> 25:34.785
I'm good, I'm good. Help Drifter.

25:35.369 --> 25:37.371
Prince is hit.
-Fuck!

25:37.371 --> 25:39.289
Foot patrol leaving the target area.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.834
Six or seven fighters
going down to the tree line.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.752
<i>You gotta move. You don't have much time.</i>

25:44.545 --> 25:46.129
Drifter!

25:48.841 --> 25:49.842
<i>You okay?</i>

25:52.052 --> 25:53.887
Just key in the comms, "I'm here."

25:55.681 --> 25:58.392
<i>Just move your head. Move your foot.</i>

26:09.444 --> 26:12.281
<i>Bambi, this is Triple.
I can't get back to you, brother.</i>

26:12.281 --> 26:14.241
<i>I'm stuck. I'm at least ten minutes out.</i>

26:14.867 --> 26:18.537
<i>You've got fighters closing in
on Prince's position. Thirty seconds.</i>

26:28.297 --> 26:33.135
Just move your foot or your head.
Just key in the comms, "I'm here."

26:34.052 --> 26:35.762
<i>Taliban on you in 20 seconds.</i>

26:53.697 --> 26:56.867
<i>Triple, get back to the bird.
I got Prince. I'm headed down.</i>

27:09.421 --> 27:11.507
Drifter is dead. We gotta go down.

27:11.507 --> 27:15.135
Are you sure?
-Drifter is dead. We gotta go.

27:16.261 --> 27:17.513
Fuck! Are you sure?

27:44.456 --> 27:45.749
You feel so good.

27:47.626 --> 27:48.877
So do you.

28:17.489 --> 28:18.490
Hey.

28:19.992 --> 28:21.076
What's wrong?

28:22.703 --> 28:23.996
Is it Drifter?

28:27.124 --> 28:29.084
Why don't you talk to Bambi about it?

28:59.531 --> 29:02.117
Hey, can I ask you something
about the mission?

29:07.414 --> 29:11.752
I'm trying to piece it together,
but he's not talking to me about it.

29:21.011 --> 29:25.849
He got jammed up,
but I was already over the X by that time.

29:27.935 --> 29:31.396
I was doing my thing. He was doing his.

29:39.363 --> 29:41.990
I didn't really see Prince
on the op once it started.

29:50.249 --> 29:53.961
Yeah. Okay.

30:12.354 --> 30:13.355
Thank you.

30:27.244 --> 30:31.123
Thank you both for having dinner with me.
It means a lot to me.

30:31.832 --> 30:35.169
Of course.
-We're here for each other. Right?

30:35.169 --> 30:36.253
That's right.

30:38.213 --> 30:40.591
How are we this evening?
-Three specials,

30:40.591 --> 30:43.927
and get us a bottle of your
most outrageous cabernet, please.

30:43.927 --> 30:45.387
And some water for this guy.

30:49.141 --> 30:51.185
Turned your back on him
and your meal was gone.

30:52.769 --> 30:55.772
Really? That's funny.
-Oh, yeah. Every time. Yeah.

30:59.651 --> 31:02.070
Took Drifter's boys
to hockey practice today.

31:03.405 --> 31:05.115
First time they'd been back on the ice.

31:06.658 --> 31:09.036
Jason got into a thing with the coach,

31:09.536 --> 31:13.749
but he handled it well.
They're solid boys.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.542
They're so strong.

31:16.460 --> 31:20.214
Yeah. Well,
they had their dad for ten, 12 years.

31:22.549 --> 31:25.928
I don't understand. You think it's okay
for a ten-year-old to not have his dad?

31:28.096 --> 31:29.097
No.

31:30.724 --> 31:34.019
I'm saying they got a lot
of substance from their father already

31:34.019 --> 31:35.354
that'll help 'em.

31:36.522 --> 31:37.523
What the f--

31:37.523 --> 31:39.816
People surviving hardship, Prince.
It's pretty common.

31:39.816 --> 31:42.736
Right. I guess you're the best example.

31:43.654 --> 31:45.322
Well, I'm just a hard dog.

31:52.955 --> 31:54.206
What are we gonna do, bub?

32:08.303 --> 32:09.596
Maybe you made a mistake.

32:12.558 --> 32:13.559
Maybe.

32:16.353 --> 32:17.396
You did.

32:21.316 --> 32:22.317
Maybe not.

32:25.654 --> 32:29.908
Maybe on the next op,
I get smoked for something you do.

32:32.327 --> 32:34.246
You're running loops.
-Don't put this on me.

32:34.246 --> 32:36.456
You're "hypotheticalizing"...
-I'm not the problem.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.625
...and it doesn't work. You hear me?

32:39.877 --> 32:42.171
And it's gonna get you jammed up
next time we're out.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.716
I'm sorry.

32:46.717 --> 32:50.220
I'm sorry too. But he needs to own this,
otherwise we can't move on.

32:52.639 --> 32:54.850
Accountability is a bitch, man.

32:54.850 --> 32:55.934
God.

32:55.934 --> 32:59.271
Denial is gonna tear you up.
It's gonna fuck you up.

33:00.689 --> 33:01.857
Is that right?

33:01.857 --> 33:05.277
Drifter is dead. Your friend is dead.

33:05.277 --> 33:07.696
Do we have to make it about this?
-Grieving widow.

33:07.696 --> 33:09.072
There's two kids.

33:09.072 --> 33:11.909
We just need to agree on this, man,
and come clean about it.

33:21.251 --> 33:22.252
I'm gonna go.

33:24.755 --> 33:25.756
I'm sorry.

33:31.386 --> 33:33.889
You watch your six down there
if I don't see you before you go, okay?

33:33.889 --> 33:34.973
Okay.

34:03.627 --> 34:06.922
I'm sorry I was hard on him.
I was just trying to tell the truth.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.799
I don't understand you sometimes.

34:08.799 --> 34:11.510
He would do exactly the same
to me if he thought I'd screwed up.

34:11.510 --> 34:12.594
No, he wouldn't.

34:13.971 --> 34:16.389
He didn't have to leave him behind.

34:22.521 --> 34:24.857
Well, maybe it's a good thing
you're getting out now.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.192
What's that supposed to mean?

34:27.192 --> 34:28.985
Maybe it's not what you're meant to do.

34:29.570 --> 34:31.321
I don't know, jump to politics.
-What?

34:31.321 --> 34:34.533
Whatever it is, you're taking out
your frustrations on Bambi.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.827
You were there too.
You didn't save Drifter.

34:36.827 --> 34:40.289
This whole thing falls apart
if we can't be honest with each other.

34:40.289 --> 34:43.083
And you're sure this isn't
about competition between you guys?

34:43.083 --> 34:44.918
Is that what you really think of me?
-Just asking.

34:44.918 --> 34:46.753
That's a gross question.

34:46.753 --> 34:49.422
I'm in pain too,
but instead of thinking of that,

34:49.422 --> 34:52.592
all you can do is revert
to your redneck loyalty.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.304
Okay, I'm sorry,
I know that's a shitty thing to say,

34:56.304 --> 34:59.808
but you always take your brother's side,
no matter how horrible.

35:03.896 --> 35:06.356
Why did you even marry me
if we're not gonna be a family?

35:32.299 --> 35:33.634
I shouldn't have said that.
-Admit it.

35:33.634 --> 35:35.135
I was way out of--
-You like it.

35:35.135 --> 35:38.931
You like my redneck fucking loyalty.

35:42.184 --> 35:43.268
That's true.

36:16.260 --> 36:17.636
What is this doing here?

36:19.346 --> 36:23.433
It's a beacon. It's to keep you safe.

36:27.312 --> 36:30.482
Come on. It's the same as we carry.
It's military grade.

36:32.317 --> 36:33.610
No, thanks.

36:33.610 --> 36:37.364
You're going to Colombia.
-Right. I've been all around the world.

36:37.364 --> 36:39.241
Your phone isn't gonna work in the jungle.

36:39.241 --> 36:41.118
This is just basic safety.

36:41.785 --> 36:43.495
Now you think I'm being controlling?

36:43.495 --> 36:46.832
This is protection against an emergency.
Come on.

36:48.041 --> 36:49.751
I'm concerned is all.

36:49.751 --> 36:50.669
Yeah, well,

36:50.669 --> 36:53.839
you promised me when we got married
you wouldn't do this shit.

36:53.839 --> 36:56.717
All right,
so what if something happens to you?

36:57.759 --> 36:59.219
What is this? What are you doing?

36:59.720 --> 37:02.347
You're going out for a run now?
-Yeah.

37:02.347 --> 37:06.643
Isn't that a little dangerous?
Take the dog at least.

37:10.439 --> 37:11.648
I need time alone.

39:10.058 --> 39:11.268
We're fine, right?

39:12.769 --> 39:14.062
Yeah.

39:15.898 --> 39:17.107
Hey. Hey.

39:18.108 --> 39:20.611
Should I stay and take care of you guys?

39:20.611 --> 39:23.155
No, come on. We're big boys.

39:28.368 --> 39:32.247
Relax. Everything's fine. Come on.

39:59.608 --> 40:02.194
Good morning, y'all.
-Morning.

40:02.194 --> 40:03.570
How is everybody today?

40:03.570 --> 40:05.447
Yeah. Good.
-Good.

40:05.447 --> 40:07.366
Has anyone taken drugs today?

40:09.117 --> 40:13.205
Come on. What about coffee?
'Cause caffeine counts.

40:14.248 --> 40:15.249
Nicotine?

40:16.792 --> 40:20.379
How about a little spoonful of sugar?
It is.

40:20.379 --> 40:23.924
Sugar affects the brain
in the same way as substances of abuse.

40:24.883 --> 40:29.596
You see,
the truth is we all take drugs every day,

40:29.596 --> 40:32.349
but I am here to
talk about the heavy hitters.

40:32.975 --> 40:35.936
Here's a number for you.
Twenty-three million.

40:36.562 --> 40:39.356
That's the number of Americans
who struggle with drug addiction.

40:41.066 --> 40:42.776
We're a nation in pain.

40:45.696 --> 40:50.742
And this is very personal for me,
because my mother is a drug addict.

40:51.952 --> 40:53.203
<i>And it's frustrating,</i>

40:53.704 --> 40:58.125
because the cure for addiction
is right in front of our faces,

40:59.084 --> 41:00.794
but the scientific community,

41:00.794 --> 41:03.380
we don't want to admit
that there's a cure.

41:03.380 --> 41:04.840
And we don't want to admit it

41:04.840 --> 41:10.137
because then we would be admitting
that these guys were right.

41:13.223 --> 41:15.392
You see, neuroscience tells us

41:15.392 --> 41:20.063
that addiction is a problem
of the brain not being able to change

41:20.063 --> 41:22.649
once it is hooked onto a substance,

41:22.649 --> 41:26.612
yet we have decades
of research that tell us

41:26.612 --> 41:30.407
psychedelics are the most powerful
mind-altering compounds on this planet.

41:30.407 --> 41:35.621
Now, I am not suggesting we all drop acid,
and we're cured. No.

41:36.330 --> 41:40.709
You need to be in a therapeutic setting,
and you need to be guided.

41:41.585 --> 41:44.922
Fortunately, there are people
that exist on this planet

41:44.922 --> 41:47.466
who know how to use
psychedelics therapeutically.

41:48.258 --> 41:49.676
We call them "shamans."

41:52.054 --> 41:54.348
He must be doing something right,

41:54.348 --> 41:59.311
because addiction
is essentially unknown in his community.

42:00.437 --> 42:03.357
<i>In fact, it does not exist.</i>

42:10.989 --> 42:13.283
Touch of ginger, bit of soy.

42:13.283 --> 42:16.912
Yeah, that's magic. You are a magician.

42:16.912 --> 42:19.206
Nah, I'm just one of the elves.

42:20.457 --> 42:21.875
That's good. We're done.

42:22.751 --> 42:23.836
Bye-bye.

42:24.586 --> 42:27.089
Okay, Arthur, lay it on me.

42:27.089 --> 42:31.718
It's our last day in the lab.
I am wide open for advice.

42:31.718 --> 42:33.470
We're gonna have one of those moments

42:33.470 --> 42:38.392
where the mentor encourages
his star student to believe in her vision.

42:38.892 --> 42:40.477
I believe.

42:40.477 --> 42:45.232
It's everybody else who thinks I'm crazy
for going to South America

42:45.232 --> 42:50.445
to study plants and rituals all to find,
you know, cures for addiction.

42:50.445 --> 42:53.156
Yeah, well,
we talked about frontier science.

42:53.156 --> 42:55.701
You're gonna get a lot of skepticism
and ridicule,

42:55.701 --> 42:58.579
but I can see the future,
and in it, you help.

42:59.955 --> 43:03.375
With your grasp of alkaloids,
you could be the next Timothy Leary.

43:05.419 --> 43:08.672
I do like to do good,
but maybe that's vanity.

43:08.672 --> 43:09.756
No.

43:11.175 --> 43:12.176
It's who you are.

44:14.863 --> 44:16.949
<i>I read your study before you came.</i>

44:18.325 --> 44:19.326
<i>We all did.</i>

44:20.702 --> 44:23.956
"Not all frontiers are in outer space.

44:25.290 --> 44:31.922
Alkaloids are the last great black holes.
They must be explored."

44:33.507 --> 44:34.508
Thanks.

44:35.008 --> 44:36.385
Hey, Amber.
-Yeah?

44:36.385 --> 44:37.761
We got enough.

44:37.761 --> 44:39.137
No, keep going.

44:40.556 --> 44:41.557
Be careful.

44:42.808 --> 44:44.393
This is why we came here.

44:44.935 --> 44:46.311
Yeah.

44:48.063 --> 44:49.398
Oh, nice.

44:51.066 --> 44:53.944
Okay, guys. Let's go to work.

44:53.944 --> 44:55.821
Nice.
-These are all mature.

44:55.821 --> 44:56.905
See?

46:02.012 --> 46:05.807
<i>We need your knowledge
for our-- for lots of stuff.</i>

46:34.127 --> 46:37.089
<i>I have to. I've got too much work to do.</i>

46:37.589 --> 46:40.676
<i>My family. They're home, waiting for me.</i>

46:45.013 --> 46:46.431
<i>Always.</i>

47:01.113 --> 47:02.114
Is this one?

47:03.824 --> 47:08.829
Don't rob Peter to pay Paul. Is it?

47:09.580 --> 47:10.956
Yeah. I think so.

47:11.498 --> 47:13.041
You wanna know what else I think?

47:13.041 --> 47:14.293
No.

47:15.335 --> 47:17.838
You wanna be the boss,
you've gotta pay the cost.

47:19.548 --> 47:23.927
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

47:25.637 --> 47:27.806
Well, some people don't have a choice.

47:30.475 --> 47:32.269
A man's character is his destiny.

47:36.857 --> 47:40.652
That's not bad. I like it. Is it Greek?

47:41.445 --> 47:42.446
Maybe.

47:46.450 --> 47:47.868
You heard from Amber?

47:49.661 --> 47:51.330
She hasn't called me in a few days.

47:54.458 --> 47:55.876
I knew she'd get in trouble.

47:57.503 --> 47:59.922
Just hope
she wasn't eaten by an alligator.

48:00.714 --> 48:02.758
You know they have 'em
all over the jungle.

48:03.425 --> 48:07.513
Or get bitten by a Zika insect
and she can't have a baby for ten years.

48:07.513 --> 48:09.681
How does your brain even do that?

48:10.182 --> 48:12.184
I read a lot.

48:14.144 --> 48:15.812
They have human slavery

48:16.396 --> 48:19.942
and whore tents in banana fields
where they get you hooked on heroin.

48:19.942 --> 48:21.026
Do they?

48:21.527 --> 48:22.736
Open your eyes.

48:23.529 --> 48:28.200
You better go down there.
Take care of your sister, buster.

48:28.700 --> 48:32.287
Why can't we just talk without you
turning everything into the apocalypse?

48:33.080 --> 48:36.291
We don't know nothing about the dark side,
do we?

48:56.728 --> 48:57.729
Hello.

48:58.564 --> 48:59.565
Welcome.

49:01.942 --> 49:03.151
Do we know these guys?

49:04.194 --> 49:05.779
Yeah, they're from the town.

49:09.116 --> 49:10.742
I don't know why they're here.

49:30.179 --> 49:33.432
All right. Looks like they wanna talk.

49:37.269 --> 49:38.604
What's up?

49:39.396 --> 49:40.564
What are you doing out here?

49:41.190 --> 49:43.066
Scientific research.

49:43.901 --> 49:47.070
I talked to the commander.
We already have permission.

49:47.070 --> 49:49.114
We have to check all your equipment.

49:49.114 --> 49:50.616
Gentlemen,

49:50.616 --> 49:52.784
we are here to work.

49:53.285 --> 49:57.164
I already talked to your guys back
at the village, the letter is authentic.

49:58.582 --> 49:59.583
Here.

50:06.924 --> 50:07.925
Take everything out.

50:07.925 --> 50:09.009
Check it all.

50:11.428 --> 50:13.555
Hey, what are they doing?

50:14.389 --> 50:17.059
Hey, be careful with the equipment.

50:17.059 --> 50:18.143
<i>Gracias</i>.

51:01.144 --> 51:05.148
God, please help us. Please, God.
Dear Heavenly Father, please...

51:27.629 --> 51:29.715
Yeah?
-Where are you?

51:30.841 --> 51:31.884
Lakewood.

51:31.884 --> 51:33.510
<i>Have you heard from Amber?</i>

51:34.136 --> 51:35.470
<i>Not in a few days.</i>

51:36.263 --> 51:38.307
We need to meet.
How fast can you be at my house?

51:47.149 --> 51:48.317
<i>You need context.</i>

51:49.568 --> 51:52.112
<i>Before she left,
I put a tracking beacon in her bag.</i>

51:53.280 --> 51:54.656
<i>I've been following it daily.</i>

51:54.656 --> 51:57.659
She goes into the jungle for her research
and back out to this camp,

51:57.659 --> 52:00.245
but in the last 24 hours,
the signal hasn't moved. It's been here.

52:00.871 --> 52:03.165
New camp?
-There's no way to camp here.

52:03.165 --> 52:04.958
You see,
the signal is at the bottom of a cliff.

52:06.126 --> 52:07.211
There you go.

52:07.211 --> 52:09.421
She got separated from her beacon,
that's what happened.

52:09.421 --> 52:10.797
It was in her backpack.

52:11.298 --> 52:13.091
Maybe she tossed it.
-Yeah.

52:14.134 --> 52:17.638
I'm surprised she agreed to carry
a beacon. She's supposed to be sterile.

52:17.638 --> 52:20.140
I just put in her bag.
I mean, she didn't want it.

52:20.140 --> 52:22.017
Why would she have to be sterile?

52:22.017 --> 52:24.811
For her work.
-What are you talking about?

52:24.811 --> 52:27.314
She doesn't need to be sterile,
she's a fucking scientist.

52:27.314 --> 52:28.774
I don't know what to tell you, man.

52:28.774 --> 52:32.319
What? What the fuck are you talking about
with her being sterile?

52:32.319 --> 52:33.529
That makes no sense.

52:34.821 --> 52:36.907
There's things you don't know, I guess.

52:38.367 --> 52:39.451
Well, go on.

52:42.120 --> 52:44.790
She's got a side thing she's doing
for the Agency down there.

52:45.374 --> 52:48.418
A little work for Mitch.
She's supposed to be sterile for that.

52:49.461 --> 52:53.173
Is she a field officer?
-No, she's a subcontractor. Small fry.

52:54.299 --> 52:57.386
How it works is they got thousands
and thousands of people all over the world

52:57.386 --> 52:59.596
collecting information--
-Yeah, I know how the CIA works.

52:59.596 --> 53:01.890
So it's not that big a deal.
-It's not a big deal?

53:01.890 --> 53:04.852
They put it in a file. Big data.
Nobody looks at it.

53:04.852 --> 53:07.563
You are both fucking liars.

53:07.563 --> 53:11.608
She works for the CIA in whatever
capacity, she should have told me.

53:11.608 --> 53:14.236
And you should have told me
at the very least.

53:24.037 --> 53:25.289
This is delicious.

53:27.916 --> 53:29.084
Where did you get it?

53:29.084 --> 53:30.377
You fucking serious?

53:30.377 --> 53:32.963
Yeah, where did you get it? They don't
sell this imported shit in my store.

53:32.963 --> 53:34.047
Where did you get it?

53:34.047 --> 53:37.426
At a high-end,
overpriced market for rich people.

53:39.428 --> 53:40.429
Exactly.

53:42.598 --> 53:45.559
This started when we were poor,
before she even met you.

53:45.559 --> 53:47.561
That's such a touching story.

53:47.561 --> 53:50.981
No money, no daddy,
so you both became liars.

53:51.607 --> 53:54.026
How did they do it?
Did they recruit her outta college?

53:56.111 --> 53:58.113
They get her fellowships, money, support.

53:59.698 --> 54:02.951
Well, what about Colombia?
Is she taking pictures of sensitive sites?

54:02.951 --> 54:06.663
I'm calling Mitch. No, she does not.
-That's really fucking dangerous.

54:08.790 --> 54:09.917
Yeah.

54:17.508 --> 54:19.760
I was just about to call you.
-Well, go.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.136
<i>She and two scientists</i>

54:21.136 --> 54:24.431
got rolled up by an ELN guerrilla group
operating in the area.

54:24.431 --> 54:25.891
We have contacts into them.

54:26.683 --> 54:28.727
We know the leadership.
She had permission to be there.

54:28.727 --> 54:30.646
It was a mistake, it'll get sorted.

54:30.646 --> 54:37.152
Now, the other two scientists may
have been executed, but she's okay.

54:37.152 --> 54:39.196
<i>American, special status.</i>

54:39.196 --> 54:42.115
I need you to call me every 30 minutes,
give me an update.

54:42.115 --> 54:44.076
<i>Roger. I got this. Hang tight.</i>

55:02.219 --> 55:03.345
I'm gonna ask you a question.

55:03.345 --> 55:05.848
I want you to really think about this
before you answer.

55:09.268 --> 55:11.603
How much do you trust the CIA
at this point?
