When Sarah disappeared,
it didn't feel real at first.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.226
Then she didn't come home,

03:03.270 --> 03:06.621
and it felt really real. Really.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.971
I mean, years went by.

There was always a question,

I'd accepted it,

03:20.939 --> 03:22.898
along comes Hollywood.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.900
You know,
when that show first hit,

03:24.943 --> 03:26.467
friends dropped me.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.034
People were accosting me
in the street.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.733
I thought my life
couldn't get any worse.

03:31.776 --> 03:32.995
And then you were arrested
for the murder

03:33.038 --> 03:34.605
of your high school girlfriend.

03:34.649 --> 03:38.305
I promise, I had nothing to do
with Sarah's disappearance.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.176

The evidence does not
look good for you,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.351

03:41.395 --> 03:43.266
Your girlfriend was found
buried

03:43.310 --> 03:45.790
at the Staten Island hotel
property that your family owns.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.010
I never even set foot
on that property

03:48.053 --> 03:51.448
until I started running the
company after my father passed.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.624
And then there are the
fragments of your sweatshirt

03:53.668 --> 03:55.713
that were found
with Sarah's body,

03:55.757 --> 03:57.715

with your blood on it.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.282
How do you explain that?

03:59.326 --> 04:01.850
I probably got blood on it
during practice.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.939
Sarah used to wear my sweatshirt
all the time.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.375

another problem.

of Sarah from that night,

04:09.858 --> 04:11.686
the night of the party
when she disappeared,

04:11.729 --> 04:13.731
and she is not wearing
your sweatshirt

04:13.775 --> 04:15.342

04:19.781 --> 04:21.304

to harm Sarah.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.306
Plus, there are multiple
witnesses from the party

04:23.350 --> 04:26.570
that claim that they saw the two
of you get into a huge fight

04:26.614 --> 04:27.745
where you got so angry,

04:27.789 --> 04:29.791
you kicked a table
across the room.

Look, Sarah broke up with me
that night.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.535
We'd been together
for three years.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.320
It caught me off guard. I was
drunk, and I was pissed off.

04:37.364 --> 04:41.106
But I took my anger out on
the coffee table, not on Sarah.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.021
I would never hurt her.
I loved her.

to my life,

He says "disappeared."

that damn show.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.984
It's New York.
It's a sophisticated city.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.638
I'm sure
there are plenty of people

09:55.682 --> 09:58.032
who wouldn't bother
with that kind of trash TV.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.251
Good morning.
Show of hands--

10:00.295 --> 10:04.168
who here has seen the docuseries
When Rich Boys Kill?

10:04.212 --> 10:05.996
BULL [sighs]:Well,

10:06.040 --> 10:08.390
this is going to be like looking

10:08.433 --> 10:11.175
for the least stinky T-shirt
in a bag of dirty laundry.

10:11.219 --> 10:14.178
Never done it.
Don't like the idea of it.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.485
Well, hold your nose.
Chunk's diving in.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.226
CHUNK:
You, sir--

10:18.269 --> 10:19.357
you didn't watch the series.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.403
Is there any other reason

10:21.446 --> 10:22.709
you may have already
formed an opinion

10:22.752 --> 10:24.667
about my client's
guilt or innocence?

10:24.711 --> 10:27.278
He's on trial for murder.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.454
Where there's smoke
there's fire.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.328
Your Honor, we would like
to thank and excuse this juror.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.940
CHUNK:
Juror number nine,

10:36.984 --> 10:38.246
after watching
When Rich Boys Kill,

10:38.289 --> 10:40.291
did you form an opinion
about my client's

10:40.335 --> 10:41.510
guilt or innocence?

10:41.553 --> 10:43.686
I don't watch many
of these types of shows.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.645
I think
most of them are too salacious.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.995
But this one was
a true documentary.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.997
The producers really
did their research.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.521
And it's pretty clear
Jackson killed that girl.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.566
She's embarrassed by how much
she enjoyed the show.

10:54.610 --> 10:57.134
Highly educated,
with a serious job,

10:57.178 --> 10:59.223
I would think?

10:59.267 --> 11:01.704
Cecilia Williams, 30.
She has a BA

11:01.748 --> 11:04.446
and a Master's degree
in anthropology from Cornell.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.795
She's a Ph.D. candidate

11:05.839 --> 11:07.318
at Columbia.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.711
Hmm. So her intellect

11:08.755 --> 11:10.104
is her identity.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.583
I wonder how much

11:11.627 --> 11:14.108
she likes it
when someone proves her wrong?

11:17.111 --> 11:19.940
Growing up,
did you believe in Santa Claus?

11:19.983 --> 11:22.682
Every kid believes in Santa.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.466
And how did you feel
when your parents told you

11:24.509 --> 11:25.989
that Santa wasn't real?

11:26.033 --> 11:28.600
They didn't tell me.
A classmate did.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.515
And how did that make you feel?

11:30.559 --> 11:32.779
Like a fool.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.651
All the other kids knew
he was fake but me.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.914
I had a hard time believing
anything my parents told me

11:37.958 --> 11:39.829
for a while after that.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.745
MARISSA:
What, you think
Cecilia's gonna be mad

11:42.789 --> 11:44.791
when she finds out
the docuseries didn't tell

11:44.834 --> 11:47.576
the whole story,
like she believes?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.752
I'm counting on it.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.455

12:01.242 --> 12:05.376
Okay, Astrid is down
for the count.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.030
Last text of the night,
I swear it is.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.685
It's fine.No, it's not, actually.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.034
Mm.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.689
[sighs]
When I was pregnant,

12:13.733 --> 12:17.345
I read every single baby book
I could get my hands on.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.651
I mean, books
on sleep training

12:19.695 --> 12:21.784
and breastfeeding
and how to raise

12:21.828 --> 12:24.526
an emotionally healthy child,
but... [sighs]

12:24.569 --> 12:27.050
...there's no book
on how to be normal

12:27.094 --> 12:29.400
after your child
has been kidnapped.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.402
Are we gonna need
another bottle?

12:31.446 --> 12:33.491
[both laugh]

12:36.538 --> 12:39.541
So, how does, um...
how does Jason seem?

12:39.584 --> 12:41.412
At work, I mean.

12:41.456 --> 12:44.241
Does... does he seem like
he's back to normal?

12:45.286 --> 12:47.636
Uh, you should ask him.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.596
Of course.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.598
I am sorry.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.558
I didn't mean to put you
in the middle of anything.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.038
It's okay.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.649
I can't believe
we've never done this before.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.172
I know.[laughs]

13:02.216 --> 13:04.566
It is so nice
to just... hang out.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.484
Mm.

13:09.527 --> 13:13.618
So, I had a... pretty
interesting call yesterday.

13:13.662 --> 13:14.663
Do tell.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.578
Well, after I sold my company

13:16.621 --> 13:18.798
last year, I put feelers out to
let people know I was looking.

13:18.841 --> 13:22.932
Anyway, have you ever heard
of Shimmer Health & Wellness?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.934
My bathroom looks
like a Sephora.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.414
I happen to know a thing or two

13:26.457 --> 13:28.546
about the health
and beauty industry.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.548
Well...

13:30.592 --> 13:33.943
they're looking
to bring in a new CEO.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.207
They should be so lucky.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.209
What does Bull think?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.646
I haven't told him yet.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.823
He'll be supportive.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.738
And that's a problem?

13:46.782 --> 13:48.523
I don't know if I'm ready

13:48.566 --> 13:50.394
to go back to work
after what happened.

13:50.438 --> 13:53.136
I mean, who would I trust
to watch Astrid?

13:53.180 --> 13:55.269
I mean, I chose a bar around
the corner from our apartment,

13:55.312 --> 13:57.053
and I've already texted
my husband five times

13:57.097 --> 13:58.707
to make sure she's okay.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.056
Can I give you a little advice

14:00.100 --> 14:01.536
that my Grandmother Amalia
used to give me?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.539
Just 'cause you go on a date

14:04.582 --> 14:06.410
does not mean
you have to get married.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.021
Take the meeting.

Every witness the prosecutor's

thing-- that you have a temper.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.902
Listen, whatever anyone says
in that courtroom,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.991
your job is to not react.

14:22.035 --> 14:25.603
Because
if you give that jury an excuse

14:25.647 --> 14:27.257
to believe anything
that they hear, it...

14:27.301 --> 14:29.477

Yes. I played football
with Jackson

during our junior
and senior years of high school.

Did you witness Jackson Martin

15:18.700 --> 15:20.658
having any anger issues
during that time?

15:20.702 --> 15:22.312
Yeah, Jackson lost his temper

15:22.356 --> 15:24.271
at football practice
plenty of times.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.316
He could be a
real hothead.How so?

15:26.360 --> 15:27.752
He'd yell,

15:27.796 --> 15:29.537
he'd rough you up on the field.

his temper with Sarah Norris?

Yes.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.461
I'll never forget it.

There was this one time
the two of them got into it

15:42.593 --> 15:44.291
in the hallway,
and I don't know

15:44.334 --> 15:45.814
what she did to tick him off,

15:45.857 --> 15:48.730
but he pushed her up
against a locker, hard,

15:48.773 --> 15:51.994
and he was screaming at her
an inch from her face.

that you're remembering

16:10.230 --> 16:12.232
I mean, it was a long time ago,
right?

I'm positive.

This is already at 200,000 hits
and climbing.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.982
I can't risk having Jackson
getting provoked again.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.984
I want you on him,
starting tomorrow.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.073
You want me to
babysit this guy?

19:22.117 --> 19:23.988
I know he's been accused
of murder, but if

19:24.032 --> 19:26.295
that makes you uncomfortable,
I can hire security.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.644
Please. I was undercover

19:27.688 --> 19:29.385
with the Vega brothers
for almost a year.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.171
I think I can handle the
Prince of Park Avenue.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.435
Oh, by the way, don't say that

19:35.478 --> 19:38.089
to his...To his face. Yeah, got it.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.615
PAZ:
I was the lead detective on
the original case back in '99.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.225
Back then,
we didn't have Sarah's body,

19:43.269 --> 19:44.487
so it was
a missing person's case.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.620
But after 48 hours,

19:46.663 --> 19:48.622
a girl like that,
from a good home--

19:48.665 --> 19:50.232
she didn't seem like
the kind of girl

19:50.276 --> 19:52.365
that would just take
off like that, so,

19:52.408 --> 19:53.801
you just know.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.150
WEISS:
And at the time,
did you have a prime suspect?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.631
Jackson Martin, the boyfriend.

19:57.674 --> 20:01.112
They'd had a nasty
public break-up.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.985
Unfortunately, I only had one
opportunity to interview him.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.334
Why is that?

20:05.378 --> 20:08.250
Well, his father, Lyle Martin,

20:08.294 --> 20:09.730
paid a visit to my lieutenant.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.123
He was in the office
for about an hour.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.691
After he left,
my lieutenant informed me

20:14.735 --> 20:16.432
that Jackson is no longer
a suspect

20:16.476 --> 20:18.173
in Sarah's disappearance.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.088
Did he give you a reason why?

20:20.131 --> 20:22.090
No, but about a week later,

20:22.133 --> 20:24.832
my lieutenant leaves for
a two-week vacation to Cancún.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.616
You tell me how
he can afford to do that

20:26.660 --> 20:27.965
on a cop's salary.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.358
Objection, Your Honor.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.925
This is speculation.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.927
Maybe the lieutenant
was a good saver,

20:32.970 --> 20:35.016
went off on one of
those time-share gambits.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.887
Detective Paz has no way
of knowing.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.020
I get it, Counselor.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.282
Sustained.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.197
Stick to the facts, Detective.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.504
WEISS:
Other than the timing

20:44.547 --> 20:47.507
of Lyle Martin's visit
and your lieutenant's vacation,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.900
was there any other fact
that made you think

20:49.944 --> 20:51.772
those two events were connected?

20:51.815 --> 20:53.817
Yes, there was.

20:53.861 --> 20:57.299
A week after my lieutenant
came back from his family trip,

20:57.343 --> 20:59.562
his wife stopped by the office
to take him to lunch.

20:59.606 --> 21:03.087
She had a keychain
from the Martin Hotel in Cancún.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.611
They didn't stay
at a time-share.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.787
Objection,
Your Honor, not only

21:06.830 --> 21:09.877
is this blatant speculation,
it's highly inflammatory.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.357
Overruled.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.054
I'll allow it this time.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.796
The jury can draw
their own conclusions.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.453
We've just lost
juror number nine.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.019
Yeah, not just number nine.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.413
I am looking
at the Red Sea right now.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.424
Did you know that
Dad paid off that lieutenant?

21:35.468 --> 21:36.817
No, I had no idea.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.558
Okay, let's not
do this here.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.603
So to avoid another incident,

21:40.647 --> 21:43.214
my investigator, Danny James, is
gonna meet us at the back door

21:43.258 --> 21:44.564
and drive you home.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.130
Billy, I'm putting you
on the stand tomorrow.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.132
Your alibi now is
more important than ever.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.743
So Dr. Bull and I want
to take you straight

21:49.786 --> 21:51.266
to TAC and prep you.
Is that okay?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.441
Of course.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.357
You lied to me.Mrs. Norris...

21:55.401 --> 21:56.750
All those years
when you swore to me

21:56.793 --> 21:58.708
that you...
you didn't hurt her?

21:58.752 --> 22:00.841
I didn't.
I swear to you...Don't you dare

22:00.884 --> 22:02.843
lie to me again.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.845
If you didn't hurt my Sarah,

22:04.888 --> 22:07.761
then why did your dad
pay off the police?

22:07.804 --> 22:11.417
And you-- how much of Daddy's
money are you getting?

22:11.460 --> 22:15.290
I hope it's worth letting
my daughter's killer go free.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.336
I'm done. Let's go.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.731
WOMAN:
Jamie Fraser is
the King of Men.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.865
He's by far the sexiest
Outlandercharacter. Full stop.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.128
WOMAN 2:
Come on. Show Frank some love.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.695
The man is brilliant and loyal.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.044
He's in denial.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.393
Admit it. That is totally hot.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.264
Frank isn't good enough
to iron Jamie's kilt.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.049
WOMAN:
Frank is so damn loyal,
he's a lapdog.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.572
Who stays with a woman

22:36.616 --> 22:39.488
who doesn't love him and is
carrying another man's baby?

22:39.532 --> 22:41.621
Oh, hell no.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.971
[distant horn honks]

22:44.014 --> 22:46.147
[distant chatter]

22:46.190 --> 22:49.368
Hey. Think that hat
makes you incognito?

22:49.411 --> 22:51.370
[horn honking]I'm hungry.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.893
Order DoorDash.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.331
I am going nuts up there,

22:56.375 --> 22:59.595
watching my life play out
on a 24/7 news cycle.

22:59.639 --> 23:02.729
You see that van
at the end of the street?

23:02.772 --> 23:03.904
That's TMZ.

23:03.947 --> 23:05.427
They're just waiting for someone

23:05.471 --> 23:08.212
to provoke you so that they can
get a fresh new story

23:08.256 --> 23:10.127
for their news cycle.

23:10.171 --> 23:14.436
Well, I only see one solution
to the problem we're having.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.743
I didn't know what you liked,

23:16.786 --> 23:18.571
so I got one
of everything.

23:18.614 --> 23:21.095
Hmm. Spendy.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.966
What was that?

23:23.010 --> 23:26.796
Nothing.
Just, um, whatever's good.

23:28.058 --> 23:31.758
You planning on whipping out
a search warrant?

23:31.801 --> 23:33.107
[laughs]

23:33.150 --> 23:34.848
Because the police already
came through here.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.850
They did a pretty
thorough job of it.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.852
Just doing my thing.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.549
That Bolognese?

23:40.593 --> 23:42.595
Yeah.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.598
Hmm.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.084
[distant sirens blaring]

23:55.085 --> 23:57.000
You think I did
it, don't you?

23:57.044 --> 23:59.046
I mean, hey, I get it.

23:59.089 --> 24:02.136
Even my own father thought
I did.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.487
You really didn't know about
your dad paying off that cop?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.489
You know, it's bad enough

24:07.533 --> 24:10.361
strangers think
that I killed Sarah.

24:10.405 --> 24:13.887
But knowing my dad died
believing that?

24:16.890 --> 24:19.458
Uh-oh. Damn it.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.504
Oh, I got some soda water
in the fridge.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.550
[distant sirens]

24:29.555 --> 24:31.513
Is that you and your dad?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.472
Yeah. He was my hero.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.039
What's going on
with your shoulder there?

24:36.083 --> 24:38.041
Oh, I messed it
up pretty bad.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.956
[phone camera shutter clicks]Torn rotator cuff.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.350
Had to sit out the rest
of the football season.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.395
It happened during the game?

24:44.439 --> 24:48.574
After. I got in a fight
with the QB from the other team.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.750
When people say
I was a hothead in high school,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.795
they're not wrong.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.972
I never touched Sarah.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.366
Never.

24:58.409 --> 25:01.021
But I could be
a bit of a dick back then.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.982
And now?

25:06.026 --> 25:08.115
Well, I'm not Gandhi,

25:08.158 --> 25:10.987
but I'm not the same
guy I was back then.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.820
Sarah disappeared
a few weeks after that fight.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.999
I guess losing her
gave me a little perspective

25:23.043 --> 25:25.306
as to what's worth
getting worked up over.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.003
You know?

25:29.005 --> 25:30.790
If your brother didn't kill
Sarah Norris,

25:30.833 --> 25:33.662
then why did your father pay off
the police lieutenant?

25:33.706 --> 25:35.272
I don't believe
he did pay him off.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.579
That's just
one cop's speculation.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.625
Because it's a fact

25:39.668 --> 25:42.671
that your father went to the
police station, and soon after,

25:42.715 --> 25:45.979
the police dropped
the investigation into Jackson.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.371
Isn't... isn't that correct?

25:47.415 --> 25:48.938
I guess.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.679
Never say "I guess."

25:50.723 --> 25:52.594
You need to be firm
in all of your answers.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.161
Anything that sounds
like a hedge,

25:54.204 --> 25:56.598
and the jury is going
to start losing trust.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.644
Okay. Thanks.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.823
Uh,

26:03.866 --> 26:07.348
my father hated scandal,

26:07.391 --> 26:09.568
gossip.

26:09.611 --> 26:13.180
I believe he went to
the lieutenant to talk to him,

26:13.223 --> 26:15.661
to quiet these false rumors
about my brother.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.750
That's all.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.579
Billy, where were you the night
Sarah was murdered?

26:20.622 --> 26:22.885
A bunch of us from school
were at a party that night,

26:22.929 --> 26:24.887
in the Village.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.759
But after Sarah broke up
with Jackson,

26:26.802 --> 26:28.891
he wanted to get out of there,
so I drove him out

26:28.935 --> 26:30.980
to our vacation home
in the Hamptons.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.940
We had some whiskey
and a few beers,

26:33.983 --> 26:36.595
and passed out
on the sofas there.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.554
And Jackson was with you
for the rest of the night?

26:39.598 --> 26:41.208
Yes.Are you sure?

26:41.251 --> 26:42.731
'Cause you admit you had a lot
to drink that night.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.690
Whiskey, beer?
Isn't that correct?

26:44.733 --> 26:46.866
Yes.That can put you into
a pretty deep sleep.

26:46.909 --> 26:50.217
Maybe while you were sleeping,
Jackson got to thinking

26:50.260 --> 26:52.219
about how angry he was
with Sarah for dumping him,

26:52.262 --> 26:54.047
and he decided
to do something about it.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.744
And then he snuck back in

26:55.788 --> 26:57.964
before you even
knew the difference.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.574
No way.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.967
I-I would've woken up.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.752
The gravel on our driveway
out there is super loud.

27:03.796 --> 27:06.320
And, besides, Jackson wouldn't
have hurt Sarah.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.669
He just never would've.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.844
How do you know that?

27:08.888 --> 27:10.890
I just know.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.893
I... I know my brother.

27:13.936 --> 27:17.636
And I saw his face when I got
home from work the next day.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.681
When he told me
Sarah was missing,

27:19.725 --> 27:21.465
he was completely white,
like a ghost.

27:21.509 --> 27:24.033
I... I had never seen him
that upset.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.905
Jackson told you
Sarah was missing

27:25.948 --> 27:27.428
after you got home from work?

27:27.471 --> 27:30.474
Yeah. When I got home
from the club where I caddied.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.998
He told me what happened.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.695
That's interesting,
'cause Jackson told us

27:33.739 --> 27:35.697
your father told the both of you

27:35.741 --> 27:38.613
at the same time when
you got back from the Hamptons.

27:40.397 --> 27:44.184
You weren't with Jackson
that night, were you?

27:46.012 --> 27:49.406
It-it doesn't matter.
I know he didn't do it.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.890
Yeah.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.936
We can't let him testify, Bull.

27:56.979 --> 27:59.242
What? No.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.462
You said Jackson needs my alibi.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.638
I'll-I'll get it straight,
I promise, but you have

28:03.682 --> 28:05.640
to put me on the stand.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.250
I know
my brother didn't do this.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.949
You-you... you can't
let him go to prison.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.777
Well, he just might
end up there.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.648
You're not taking the stand.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.090
JACKSON: Look, I know
what you must be thinking.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.831
Well, I know
what a jury would be thinking

28:22.875 --> 28:26.182
if your alibi fell apart
in front of them in court.

28:26.226 --> 28:29.055
Don't lie to me. I can't
help you if you lie to me.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.231
I'm sorry.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.798
[sighs]

28:32.841 --> 28:34.930
So if you weren't with Billy
that night, where were you?

28:34.974 --> 28:37.280
No, Billy and I did leave
the party together.No. No,

28:37.324 --> 28:39.195
Jackson, don't lie to me.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.545
Billy and I did leave
the party together,

28:41.589 --> 28:43.809
and then I realized
I just wanted to be alone,

28:43.852 --> 28:46.637
so I went to our parents' home
in the Hamptons, solo.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.639
[phone ringing]

28:48.683 --> 28:51.164
Will you turn
that damn phone off?

28:51.207 --> 28:53.644
Sorry. It's-it's Billy.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.777
He keeps calling me.
He's freaking out.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.605
Well, Billy can wait.

28:57.648 --> 29:00.042
I chose to represent you
because I believed you.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.479
I'm usually pretty good
at reading these things,

29:02.523 --> 29:04.220
but right now,
my antenna's a little bent.

29:04.264 --> 29:08.398
So, if you want me to help you,
you got to give me something.

29:08.442 --> 29:12.751
You got to make me
believe you again.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.492
I am not representing a guy

29:15.536 --> 29:18.278
who took someone's daughter
from them.

29:18.321 --> 29:21.063
I don't know what to give you,
but the plain truth is,

29:21.107 --> 29:24.240
Billy is the only one who
ever really believed in me.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.113
That's why he wanted
to give me an alibi.[sighs]

29:29.506 --> 29:32.379
It was Billy's idea
to alibi you?Yeah.

29:32.422 --> 29:35.251
Yeah. He said it was the
only way he could protect me.

29:36.426 --> 29:40.126
I'm the older brother, but
he's always tried to protect me.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.478
Excuse me. Could I have
another dirty martini, please?

29:44.521 --> 29:45.871
Extra olives.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.265
Okay, don't judge me until
you've had to watch three hours

29:49.309 --> 29:52.791
of PAW Patrolwhile your friend
gets ready for a job interview.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.705
I'll make it a double.

29:54.749 --> 29:57.447
IZZY:
Well, when it comes
to the beauty industry,

29:57.491 --> 29:59.972
everyone focuses
on Western Europe.

30:00.015 --> 30:03.453
But Russia is not only
a massive market,

30:03.497 --> 30:04.933
Russian women spend up

30:04.977 --> 30:08.545
to 30% of their income
on beauty products.

30:08.589 --> 30:12.593
I established great connections
in St. Petersburg

30:12.636 --> 30:16.162
when I took
Bella Colón Brands global,

30:16.205 --> 30:18.904
so getting Shimmer off
the ground there--

30:18.947 --> 30:20.862
it won't be a problem.

30:20.906 --> 30:24.866
What do we have to do to get you
to come on board as our new CEO?

30:24.910 --> 30:26.781
[music plays quietly]

30:30.045 --> 30:33.657
There's another offer.
Of course there is.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.007

30:47.019 --> 30:48.020
a lot of zeros.

CHUNK:
Maybe we just have
to face the fact

30:57.246 --> 30:58.682
that Jackson did it.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.250
See if the A.D.A. is willing
to offer us a deal.

31:01.294 --> 31:03.122
I don't think Jackson did it.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.168
Check out this photo.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.910
Look at his right shoulder.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.913
He's wearing a brace?A torn rotator cuff.

31:11.957 --> 31:15.525
An injury he got a few weeks
before Sarah disappeared.

31:15.569 --> 31:18.224
CHUCK:
Is he right-handed?DANNY: Yes.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.921
I know that injury. It's bad.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.488
That fresh, there's no way

31:21.531 --> 31:23.490
that Jackson would have been
able to carry Sarah's body,

31:23.533 --> 31:26.319
let alone dig a hole
at that construction site

31:26.362 --> 31:27.842
deep enough to dump it in.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.932
We could get an expert witness
to testify to that, right?

31:30.976 --> 31:33.717
Yeah, yeah, but the prosecutor's
just gonna assert

31:33.761 --> 31:36.503
that he could've had someone
help him get rid of the body,

31:36.546 --> 31:39.114
someone like his father
or his brother.

31:39.158 --> 31:42.204
Well, if Jackson's innocent,

31:42.248 --> 31:44.380
why would his father go
to pay off the cops?

31:44.424 --> 31:46.600
Why would his brother
make up an alibi?

31:46.643 --> 31:48.384
Well, maybe they knew
that he would look guilty

31:48.428 --> 31:49.864
after that fight
with Sarah.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.213
They were trying
to protect him.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.128
Maybe they weren't trying
to protect Jackson.

31:53.172 --> 31:56.131
Maybe somebody else
needed an alibi.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.959
You think Billy did it?

31:58.003 --> 31:59.961
Well, you saw him.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.746
He is certain
that Jackson is innocent,

32:02.790 --> 32:05.749
and he is desperate
to keep him out of prison.

32:05.793 --> 32:08.056
And maybe that's because

32:08.100 --> 32:10.580
he knows
who really killed Sarah.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.582
That's a hell of a theory.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.062
Any idea how we prove it?

32:15.150 --> 32:17.936
I read on your website
you like a chai latte.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.938
May I have a seat?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.768
I was surprised
to hear from you, Dr. Bull.

32:24.812 --> 32:28.729
And in my experience,
I don't like your surprises.

32:28.772 --> 32:31.471
Well, your audience likes
a good surprise, don't they?

32:31.514 --> 32:34.082
A-a certain twist,
if you will?

32:34.126 --> 32:35.736
Mm, I deal in facts.

32:35.779 --> 32:38.217
If the facts have twists,
then all the better.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.742
A high school boyfriend murders
his high school sweetheart.

32:41.785 --> 32:44.266
Not too surprising in
the scheme of things.

32:44.310 --> 32:47.052
We all have seen that
before, haven't we?

32:48.096 --> 32:51.491
But what if I could offer you
a truly shocking twist?

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
I'm listening.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.632
♪

33:06.941 --> 33:09.552
How did you get Billy
to agree to do this?

33:09.596 --> 33:11.424
Well, I just told him the truth.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.817
We can't put him on the stand.
He'll perjure himself.

33:13.861 --> 33:18.387
So, this is the only way
he can protect his brother.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.563
VANESSA:
Tell me about
the party that night.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.044
Did you witness the fight
between Jackson and Sarah?

33:23.088 --> 33:25.742
Yes. And Jackson was mad,

33:25.786 --> 33:28.702
but he was also drunk
and just being stupid.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.834
And that's why when he wanted
to get out of there,

33:30.878 --> 33:32.314
I went with him-- to make sure

33:32.358 --> 33:34.708
he wouldn't do anything
more stupid, like drive drunk.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.884
And did you see Sarah
leave the party?

33:36.927 --> 33:41.541
No. When we left, Sarah was
still there, still alive.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.979
So where did you and Jackson go
after you left the party?

33:45.023 --> 33:47.764
We drove to my parents' house
in the Hamptons.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.116
I mean, I-I drove.And what route

33:51.159 --> 33:53.248
did you take to the Hamptons?

33:53.292 --> 33:57.078
We took 27. That's really
the only route you can take.

33:59.472 --> 34:00.864
Now, did you know,

34:00.908 --> 34:03.432
there are no tolls on Route 27?

34:03.476 --> 34:05.826
Um... sure.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.437
But do you know
where there are tolls?

34:08.481 --> 34:10.657
The Verrazano Bridge.

34:10.700 --> 34:13.094
You know,
the bridge you'd take

34:13.138 --> 34:15.575
if you were, say, coming back

34:15.618 --> 34:18.665
from the Martin Hotel site
in Staten Island.

34:20.536 --> 34:21.929
If you say so.

34:21.972 --> 34:23.757
I'm just curious.
If you and your brother

34:23.800 --> 34:26.455
were in the car together
on Route 27,

34:26.499 --> 34:29.110
why do I have a photo of you,
in your car,

34:29.154 --> 34:32.070
alone,
crossing the Verrazano Bridge

34:32.113 --> 34:37.423
on October 17, 1999,

34:37.466 --> 34:39.686
the same night
that Sarah Norris was murdered,

34:39.729 --> 34:42.950
the same night her body was
dumped at that hotel site?

34:43.994 --> 34:46.084
I have, um...

34:47.302 --> 34:49.522
I'm sorry.
I-I... I need some water.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.964
Billy?

34:57.007 --> 34:59.009
Did you know
she had that photo of me?

34:59.053 --> 35:00.489
No, of course not.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.187
I mean, were they even
taking pictures

35:02.230 --> 35:03.884
at toll booths 22 years ago?

35:03.927 --> 35:06.408
I have no idea, Billy.
Is it a problem?

35:06.452 --> 35:08.541
What's going on?

35:08.584 --> 35:10.282
I mean, you got
to talk to me here.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.806
I can't go back out there.You don't have

35:12.849 --> 35:14.373
to go back out there.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.940
Just tell me what's going on
so I can help you.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.942
[panting]

35:18.986 --> 35:21.031
I didn't mean to.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.468
It was an accident.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.078
Okay.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.690
Sometimes bad things happen
even when we don't want them to.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.518
I felt bad.

35:29.562 --> 35:32.652
Jackson yelled at Sarah in front
of everyone at the party.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.133
And so, I-I went back,

35:35.176 --> 35:37.135
just to make sure she was okay.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.571
And I saw her walking home.

35:38.614 --> 35:42.792
She was drunk, crying,
so I offered her a ride.

35:42.836 --> 35:45.665
She was telling me
what a jerk Jackson was,

35:45.708 --> 35:48.537
and I thought-- I don't know--

35:48.581 --> 35:52.367
maybe she liked me a little.

35:52.411 --> 35:55.414
I wanted...

35:55.457 --> 35:57.633
I just wanted to kiss her.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.418
What are you doing?! Gross!

35:59.461 --> 36:01.333
I was just trying
to be nice to her,

36:01.376 --> 36:03.117
and she treated me like garbage.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.380
BILLY:
Oh, come on. I'm sorry.

36:05.424 --> 36:07.034
I-I won't do that again.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.557
Just get back in the car.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.777
Are you kidding? I can't
believe you did that.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.127
I'm gonna tell Jackson.Please,

36:13.171 --> 36:14.302
don't tell my brother.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.086
Promise me you won't tell him.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.305
Get off of me, you perv!

36:17.349 --> 36:19.873
Get off of me! Get off!

36:21.266 --> 36:23.920
Oh, crap. You okay?

36:23.964 --> 36:25.661
Sarah?

36:25.705 --> 36:27.446
There was so much blood.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.012
I tried to stop the bleeding

36:29.056 --> 36:30.840
with her sweatshirt.Don't, Sarah...

36:30.884 --> 36:34.017
Jackson's sweatshirt-- but

36:34.061 --> 36:36.933
she was gone, just like that.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.109
I didn't know
what to do, so I...

36:39.153 --> 36:42.504
I put her in the back of my car.

36:42.548 --> 36:45.768
I called my father
from a pay phone.

36:45.812 --> 36:49.294
He came out and met me
at the hotel on Staten Island.

36:49.337 --> 36:52.122
He said we should
bury her there

36:52.166 --> 36:55.256
because the next day, they were
putting in the new floors

36:55.300 --> 36:58.041
to the pool house.

36:58.085 --> 37:00.740
Does Jackson know about this?

37:01.784 --> 37:03.743
No.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.788
We never told him.

37:08.487 --> 37:11.185
Did you guys get that?

37:12.926 --> 37:15.015
Y-You're wired?

37:15.058 --> 37:16.886
You can't do that.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.279
You're my lawyer.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.368
No, I'm not a lawyer,

37:20.412 --> 37:23.719
and I work for Jackson, not you.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.779
Hey.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.433
Oh, hey.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.522
I was just wrapping things up

37:43.565 --> 37:45.567
with Mr. Palmer and Dr. Bull.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.919
You heard my...
my brother was arrested?

37:49.963 --> 37:52.792
Yeah. How you doing?

37:52.835 --> 37:54.097
Well, I thought, uh,
people thinking

37:54.141 --> 37:55.490
that I killed Sarah was bad,

37:55.534 --> 37:56.709
but knowing Billy killed her

37:56.752 --> 37:58.319
and then lied to me
all these years--

37:58.363 --> 37:59.668
I don't know how
to process th...

37:59.712 --> 38:00.930
Y-You know, I'm sorry.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.845
You, uh... you probably

38:02.889 --> 38:04.891
just came to say goodbye, so...

38:04.934 --> 38:08.024
It's all right. What you're
going through really sucks.

38:09.374 --> 38:12.942
Everybody's been telling
your story all these years.

38:12.986 --> 38:15.989
At least now
you can finally tell your own.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.123
Yeah, that's true. Thank you.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.261
Oh, hey?

38:29.132 --> 38:31.309
Watch out for that Bolognese.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.933
[sighs]

38:47.977 --> 38:50.328
What's all this?

38:52.112 --> 38:56.464
Shimmer Health & Wellness
asked me to be their CEO.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.423
Wow!

38:58.466 --> 39:00.947
That's a big deal.
That's incredible.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.993
So, wait. Did this just
come out of the blue, or

39:04.037 --> 39:05.995
did you get asked
for an interview or...?

39:06.039 --> 39:09.956
I had dinner with the chair
of their board the other night.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.306
Did you?

39:14.352 --> 39:17.572
So... who was
watching Astrid?

39:17.616 --> 39:19.444
Marissa.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.751
She never mentioned that.

39:22.795 --> 39:26.799
Well, I didn't know if I wanted
it to be real or not. I...

39:26.842 --> 39:29.845
So, has it gotten real?

39:29.889 --> 39:34.154
Actually... I turned them down.

39:34.197 --> 39:38.941
It would've just meant
a ton of travel, and...

39:38.985 --> 39:42.597
I'm not ready to be away
from Astrid like that.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.339
So what's all this?

39:45.383 --> 39:49.822
This... is just a thought.

39:49.865 --> 39:53.347
Can I tell you more
when it's real?

39:56.872 --> 39:58.570
Of course you can.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.528
Hmm.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.749
How you doing at work?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.751
Why? Did Marissa
say something?

40:05.794 --> 40:09.189
No, no, no,
and trust me, I tried.

40:09.232 --> 40:13.933
I just... I kind of
like you, so I worry.

40:13.976 --> 40:15.978
Well, thank you.

40:18.285 --> 40:22.507
I guess, uh, I'm less angry,

40:22.550 --> 40:26.119
but I'm... anxious.

40:26.162 --> 40:29.165
Do you think this is like
the seven stages of grief?

40:29.209 --> 40:31.907
No, it's more like the
nine circles of hell, but...

40:31.951 --> 40:35.171
Oh, baby.The only way
out is through.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.783
You're gonna keep
working on this?

40:37.826 --> 40:40.176
I don't have to.

40:40.220 --> 40:43.005
No, I think it's
a good idea, and, um...

40:45.051 --> 40:49.229
I am gonna go...
try a thought.
