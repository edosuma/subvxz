Where's Astrid?He took her. He had a gun.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.311
[phone ringing]

00:07.355 --> 00:10.184
Where's my daughter?

00:10.227 --> 00:12.621
I bet you don't even
remember who I am.[crying]

00:12.664 --> 00:14.927
BULL:
They nearly took everything
from us, didn't they?

00:14.971 --> 00:16.016
Look, if you're gonna
ask if I'm okay,

00:16.059 --> 00:18.061
Marissa,
I'm gonna throw something.

00:18.105 --> 00:19.584
Come on! What are
you afraid of?

00:19.628 --> 00:21.412
Let our client speak!

00:21.456 --> 00:23.762
Dr. Bull, please
leave my courtroom,

00:23.806 --> 00:25.242
or I'll have you removed.

00:25.286 --> 00:26.852
CHUNK:
I know you have been
through a lot,

00:26.896 --> 00:29.029
brother, and I feel
for you, I do,

00:29.072 --> 00:30.639
but you're off your game.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.336
Best you get it back.

00:35.209 --> 00:38.429
[panting]

00:38.473 --> 00:41.258

Sarah! Get back here!

00:41.302 --> 00:42.433
[twig snaps]

00:42.477 --> 00:43.869
Sarah!

00:43.913 --> 00:45.480
[Sarah gasps]

00:45.523 --> 00:47.047
Oh! [whimpers]

00:48.178 --> 00:49.875
Sarah![whimpers]

00:49.919 --> 00:52.791
Jackson. Please.

00:52.835 --> 00:55.359
[whimpers]

00:55.403 --> 00:56.578
Help!

00:56.621 --> 00:57.753
[grunts]
[yells]

00:57.796 --> 00:59.842
You can't leave me.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.670
Jackson, please. Jackson.

01:01.713 --> 01:02.801
I told you, you're mine!

01:02.845 --> 01:04.499
Jackson, no! Please!

01:04.542 --> 01:06.544
[eerie theme song plays]

01:08.546 --> 01:11.288
MARISSA:
Kind of addictive, huh?

01:11.332 --> 01:12.898
Totally.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.987
Last night, I ordered
a pie from Joe's,

01:15.031 --> 01:18.991
cracked open a bottle of rosÃ©,
binged the entire docuseries.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.602
I had Mauricio. I couldn't
start doing my homework

01:20.645 --> 01:22.343
until this morning,
and now I can't stop.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.345
You guys are eating this show up
like it's candy.

01:24.388 --> 01:27.217
You know it's about a real girl,
right? She's dead.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.438
MARISSA:
You're right.
It's easy

01:30.481 --> 01:31.961
to get sucked in.

01:32.004 --> 01:33.484
These shows are really
just sensationalizing

01:33.528 --> 01:35.747
some family's worst tragedy.

01:35.791 --> 01:38.794
At least all the hoopla over
this one led to that new witness

01:38.837 --> 01:41.710
coming forward, the police
finding Sarah's body after

01:41.753 --> 01:43.712
all these years.

01:43.755 --> 01:45.714
Do you think
Jackson Martin did it?

01:45.757 --> 01:48.020
Well, sounds like
he had a nasty temper.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.935
His girlfriend dumped him

01:49.979 --> 01:51.807
in front of all their friends,
humiliated him.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.678
And she died
that night.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.854
Odds are he did it.

01:55.898 --> 01:57.813
[clears throat]

01:57.856 --> 02:00.120
Our potential client,
Jackson Martin, is here.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.515
TAYLOR:
It's kind of weird
seeing him in person

02:04.559 --> 02:06.909
after just thinking of him
as a villain in a TV show.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.738
If he is innocent,
I feel sorry for him.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.653
I mean, how must it feel to have

02:11.696 --> 02:15.744
the whole world think
of you as... a monster?

02:15.787 --> 02:17.354
You think the Prince of
Park Avenue feels that

02:17.398 --> 02:18.964
up in his penthouse?

02:19.008 --> 02:20.705
MARYANNE:
I was doing the dishes

02:20.749 --> 02:23.273
when she left that night.

02:23.317 --> 02:27.756
I remember watching her fr...
from the kitchen window.

02:27.799 --> 02:30.193
She got in Jackson's car,

02:30.237 --> 02:32.413
she gave me a little wave,

02:32.456 --> 02:35.198
and then she was gone.[knocking]

02:35.242 --> 02:37.679
Jackson Martin just arrived.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.637
You think you know
what a bad day is,

02:39.681 --> 02:41.857
but until your child is taken
from you,

02:41.900 --> 02:44.729
you don't have a clue
what bad truly is.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.212
Bull?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.042
Client's here.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.002
Okay. Great.

02:57.046 --> 03:01.224
When Sarah disappeared,
it didn't feel real at first.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.226
Then she didn't come home,

03:03.270 --> 03:06.621
and it felt really real. Really.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.971
I mean, years went by.

03:09.014 --> 03:13.193
There was always a question,
a... hole.

03:14.455 --> 03:17.066
Just became a part of my life,
you know?

03:17.109 --> 03:20.896
And just as I thought
I'd accepted it,

03:20.939 --> 03:22.898
along comes Hollywood.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.900
You know,
when that show first hit,

03:24.943 --> 03:26.467
friends dropped me.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.034
People were accosting me
in the street.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.733
I thought my life
couldn't get any worse.

03:31.776 --> 03:32.995
And then you were arrested
for the murder

03:33.038 --> 03:34.605
of your high school girlfriend.

03:34.649 --> 03:38.305
I promise, I had nothing to do
with Sarah's disappearance.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.176
CHUNK:
The evidence does not
look good for you,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.351
Mr. Martin.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.266
Your girlfriend was found
buried

03:43.310 --> 03:45.790
at the Staten Island hotel
property that your family owns.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.010
I never even set foot
on that property

03:48.053 --> 03:51.448
until I started running the
company after my father passed.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.624
And then there are the
fragments of your sweatshirt

03:53.668 --> 03:55.713
that were found
with Sarah's body,

03:55.757 --> 03:57.715
with your football number on it,
with your blood on it.

03:57.759 --> 03:59.282
How do you explain that?

03:59.326 --> 04:01.850
I probably got blood on it
during practice.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.939
Sarah used to wear my sweatshirt
all the time.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.375
She must've had it that night.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.290
BULL:Well, here's
another problem.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.814
The docuseries has photos
of Sarah from that night,

04:09.858 --> 04:11.686
the night of the party
when she disappeared,

04:11.729 --> 04:13.731
and she is not wearing
your sweatshirt

04:13.775 --> 04:15.342
in any of those photos.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.300
And it's not just the hard
evidence that points to you.

04:17.344 --> 04:19.737
You're the only person
the police ever identified

04:19.781 --> 04:21.304
as having a motive
to harm Sarah.

04:21.348 --> 04:23.306
Plus, there are multiple
witnesses from the party

04:23.350 --> 04:26.570
that claim that they saw the two
of you get into a huge fight

04:26.614 --> 04:27.745
where you got so angry,

04:27.789 --> 04:29.791
you kicked a table
across the room.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.924
Look, Sarah broke up with me
that night.

04:32.968 --> 04:34.535
We'd been together
for three years.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.320
It caught me off guard. I was
drunk, and I was pissed off.

04:37.364 --> 04:41.106
But I took my anger out on
the coffee table, not on Sarah.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.021
I would never hurt her.
I loved her.

04:43.065 --> 04:45.850
Despite what this has done
to my life,

04:45.894 --> 04:48.940
I'm glad
that they found her body.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.855
It's been 22 years.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.335
She deserves a
proper burial.

04:52.379 --> 04:55.077
And her mom deserves closure.[phone ringing]

04:56.296 --> 04:57.384
Sorry.

04:57.427 --> 04:58.776
[muffled crying]

04:58.820 --> 05:00.604
BULL:
Where's Astrid?I don't know.

05:00.648 --> 05:01.866
He took her. He had a gun.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.564
IZZY:
Who? Who took Astrid?

05:03.607 --> 05:05.957
I don't know.
You have to answer.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.656
Where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?

05:08.699 --> 05:11.180
[phone ringing]Sorry. Sorry. It's my...

05:11.223 --> 05:13.443
my brother Billy.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.271
Caught a flight

05:15.315 --> 05:17.621
the second he found out
I was arrested.

05:17.665 --> 05:20.189
Probably just calling
to let me know he's okay.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.234
According to the police report,
you claimed

05:22.278 --> 05:24.149
to have left the party
before Sarah.

05:24.193 --> 05:25.455
Where'd you go?

05:25.499 --> 05:27.892
Uh, Billy and I went out
to the Hamptons.

05:27.936 --> 05:30.634
Our parents have
a vacation home out there.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.158
Drank a bottle of whiskey,
fell asleep on the couch.

05:33.202 --> 05:36.161
In the morning,
we drove back into Manhattan.

05:36.205 --> 05:39.513
That's when our dad told us
that Sarah was missing.

05:39.556 --> 05:40.775
And your brother
will testify to that?

05:40.818 --> 05:43.168
Yes. Absolutely.

05:43.212 --> 05:44.256

If you call the police,
your daughter dies.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.002
Do you think
you can help me, Dr. Bull?

05:51.046 --> 05:52.308
I need a minute.

05:58.227 --> 06:00.534
[panting]

06:00.577 --> 06:02.579
Bull?

06:05.626 --> 06:08.890
He's having a moment.

06:16.550 --> 06:17.942
Hey.

06:17.986 --> 06:20.902
Izzy warned me about
that chow mein for lunch.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.386
This case--

06:26.429 --> 06:28.431
maybe it's not a good fit
right now.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.868
I get why you wanted
to meet with Jackson Martin.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.870
It's a high-profile trial.[exhales]

06:32.914 --> 06:35.569
It could bring a lot
of media attention to TAC.

06:35.612 --> 06:38.223
Not to mention,
the man has money.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.748
But there are a lot
of other cases out there.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.838
A missing girl
who wound up dead--

06:43.881 --> 06:47.015
it's just too soon
after Astrid's kidnapping, Bull.

06:49.278 --> 06:52.237
His ringtone's the same
as the kidnapper's burner phone.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.239
It just...

06:54.283 --> 06:56.546
[sighs]

06:58.156 --> 07:01.638
Okay. I'm gonna tell him
we're passing.

07:01.682 --> 07:05.207
I'll say our case load
is too heavy right now.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.517
When he refers to Sarah,
he says she disappeared.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.129
Never says "murdered."
He says "disappeared."

07:15.173 --> 07:17.175
Why does that matter?

07:18.220 --> 07:21.179
He's still processing her death.

07:21.223 --> 07:24.182
If he had murdered her
22 years ago, he...

07:24.226 --> 07:27.534
he wouldn't be referring to her
as if she were still alive.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.451
I think he's innocent.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.585
I'm not letting
some ringtone...

07:35.629 --> 07:37.587
[exhales]

07:37.631 --> 07:39.459
...keep me from doing my job.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.201
We're taking this case.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.869
MAN:
Here they come.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.262
[reporters clamoring]WOMAN: Jackson.

08:00.305 --> 08:01.916
MAN: Jackson Martin,
over here.

08:01.959 --> 08:05.223
Jackson, is it true that
you filed a defamation lawsuit

08:05.267 --> 08:06.747
against Vanessa Voss,

08:06.790 --> 08:08.923
the producer of
When Rich Boys Kill?

08:08.966 --> 08:11.012
VANESSA:
No, that's right.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.404
The Prince Of Park Avenue

08:12.448 --> 08:14.319
sicced his high-priced
legal team on me.

08:14.363 --> 08:18.498
But truth is an absolute
defense to defamation,

08:18.541 --> 08:19.760
and the truth here is

08:19.803 --> 08:21.979
that Jackson Martin
murdered Sarah Norris.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.547
The legal system is not gonna
let him get away with murder.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.768
Ms. Voss may call her
show a docuseries,

08:27.811 --> 08:29.944
but its goal is
to entertain,

08:29.987 --> 08:32.599
to manipulate facts in order
to get the best story,

08:32.642 --> 08:34.209
to get the best ratings.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.080
And I'm not interested
in ratings.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.082
I'm interested in justice.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.649
Justice for Sarah Norris,

08:39.693 --> 08:41.956
who tragically lost her life
22 years ago.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.610
And justice
for Jackson Martin,

08:43.653 --> 08:47.701
who is also innocent, but is
being vilified by Vanessa Voss

08:47.744 --> 08:50.834
just so she can make money
off her serialized piece

08:50.878 --> 08:52.880
of fiction. Thank you.

08:52.923 --> 08:55.099
Vanessa, statement, please.Miss Voss, care to comment?

08:57.145 --> 08:59.451
This all the discovery
from the defamation suit?

08:59.495 --> 09:02.846
Yeah. We got all their
raw footage and research.

09:02.890 --> 09:06.154
Bad news is, most of it
makes Jackson look guilty.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.330
Now, see, why you always got
to greet me with bad news?

09:08.373 --> 09:09.636
Okay, see,
now you're making me want

09:09.679 --> 09:11.289
to keep my good news to myself.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.901
No, no, no. Please,
I need some. Hit me.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.643
It's more of a theory, but
I think I may have figured out

09:16.686 --> 09:18.819
how Jackson's bloody sweatshirt
could've wound up

09:18.862 --> 09:20.124
buried with Sarah.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.694
Okay. What am I looking at?

09:24.738 --> 09:25.956
Her purse.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.784
The night Sarah was murdered,
no one remembers

09:27.828 --> 09:30.091
her wearing Jackson's
sweatshirt, right?

09:30.134 --> 09:32.441
Maybe that's because
she had it in her purse.

09:32.484 --> 09:35.618
I don't go anywhere without
some kind of sweater in my bag.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.272
Girls get cold.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.623
When Sarah left the party,
she was walking home.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.625
Maybe she got cold,
pulled the sweatshirt

09:42.669 --> 09:44.235
out of her bag and put it on.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.628
That's good.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.630
I think I can put that
in front of a jury.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.414
That is,
if I can get a fair jury.

09:49.458 --> 09:50.938
Everybody and their dog
has watched

09:50.981 --> 09:52.243
that damn show.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.984
It's New York.
It's a sophisticated city.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.638
I'm sure
there are plenty of people

09:55.682 --> 09:58.032
who wouldn't bother
with that kind of trash TV.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.251
Good morning.
Show of hands--

10:00.295 --> 10:04.168
who here has seen the docuseries
When Rich Boys Kill?

10:04.212 --> 10:05.996
BULL [sighs]:Well,

10:06.040 --> 10:08.390
this is going to be like looking

10:08.433 --> 10:11.175
for the least stinky T-shirt
in a bag of dirty laundry.

10:11.219 --> 10:14.178
Never done it.
Don't like the idea of it.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.485
Well, hold your nose.
Chunk's diving in.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.226
CHUNK:
You, sir--

10:18.269 --> 10:19.357
you didn't watch the series.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.403
Is there any other reason

10:21.446 --> 10:22.709
you may have already
formed an opinion

10:22.752 --> 10:24.667
about my client's
guilt or innocence?

10:24.711 --> 10:27.278
He's on trial for murder.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.454
Where there's smoke
there's fire.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.328
Your Honor, we would like
to thank and excuse this juror.

10:33.371 --> 10:36.940
CHUNK:
Juror number nine,

10:36.984 --> 10:38.246
after watching
When Rich Boys Kill,

10:38.289 --> 10:40.291
did you form an opinion
about my client's

10:40.335 --> 10:41.510
guilt or innocence?

10:41.553 --> 10:43.686
I don't watch many
of these types of shows.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.645
I think
most of them are too salacious.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.995
But this one was
a true documentary.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.997
The producers really
did their research.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.521
And it's pretty clear
Jackson killed that girl.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.566
She's embarrassed by how much
she enjoyed the show.

10:54.610 --> 10:57.134
Highly educated,
with a serious job,

10:57.178 --> 10:59.223
I would think?

10:59.267 --> 11:01.704
Cecilia Williams, 30.
She has a BA

11:01.748 --> 11:04.446
and a Master's degree
in anthropology from Cornell.

11:04.489 --> 11:05.795
She's a Ph.D. candidate

11:05.839 --> 11:07.318
at Columbia.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.711
Hmm. So her intellect

11:08.755 --> 11:10.104
is her identity.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.583
I wonder how much

11:11.627 --> 11:14.108
she likes it
when someone proves her wrong?

11:17.111 --> 11:19.940
Growing up,
did you believe in Santa Claus?

11:19.983 --> 11:22.682
Every kid believes in Santa.

11:22.725 --> 11:24.466
And how did you feel
when your parents told you

11:24.509 --> 11:25.989
that Santa wasn't real?

11:26.033 --> 11:28.600
They didn't tell me.
A classmate did.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.515
And how did that make you feel?

11:30.559 --> 11:32.779
Like a fool.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.651
All the other kids knew
he was fake but me.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.914
I had a hard time believing
anything my parents told me

11:37.958 --> 11:39.829
for a while after that.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.745
MARISSA:
What, you think
Cecilia's gonna be mad

11:42.789 --> 11:44.791
when she finds out
the docuseries didn't tell

11:44.834 --> 11:47.576
the whole story,
like she believes?

11:47.619 --> 11:49.752
I'm counting on it.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.755
âª

11:52.799 --> 11:55.323
[lively chatter]

11:55.366 --> 11:57.455
Marissa!

12:01.242 --> 12:05.376
Okay, Astrid is down
for the count.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.030
Last text of the night,
I swear it is.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.685
It's fine.No, it's not, actually.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.034
Mm.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.689
[sighs]
When I was pregnant,

12:13.733 --> 12:17.345
I read every single baby book
I could get my hands on.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.651
I mean, books
on sleep training

12:19.695 --> 12:21.784
and breastfeeding
and how to raise

12:21.828 --> 12:24.526
an emotionally healthy child,
but... [sighs]

12:24.569 --> 12:27.050
...there's no book
on how to be normal

12:27.094 --> 12:29.400
after your child
has been kidnapped.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.402
Are we gonna need
another bottle?

12:31.446 --> 12:33.491
[both laugh]

12:36.538 --> 12:39.541
So, how does, um...
how does Jason seem?

12:39.584 --> 12:41.412
At work, I mean.

12:41.456 --> 12:44.241
Does... does he seem like
he's back to normal?

12:45.286 --> 12:47.636
Uh, you should ask him.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.596
Of course.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.598
I am sorry.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.558
I didn't mean to put you
in the middle of anything.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.038
It's okay.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.649
I can't believe
we've never done this before.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.172
I know.[laughs]

13:02.216 --> 13:04.566
It is so nice
to just... hang out.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.484
Mm.

13:09.527 --> 13:13.618
So, I had a... pretty
interesting call yesterday.

13:13.662 --> 13:14.663
Do tell.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.578
Well, after I sold my company

13:16.621 --> 13:18.798
last year, I put feelers out to
let people know I was looking.

13:18.841 --> 13:22.932
Anyway, have you ever heard
of Shimmer Health & Wellness?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.934
My bathroom looks
like a Sephora.

13:24.978 --> 13:26.414
I happen to know a thing or two

13:26.457 --> 13:28.546
about the health
and beauty industry.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.548
Well...

13:30.592 --> 13:33.943
they're looking
to bring in a new CEO.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.207
They should be so lucky.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.209
What does Bull think?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.646
I haven't told him yet.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.823
He'll be supportive.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.738
And that's a problem?

13:46.782 --> 13:48.523
I don't know if I'm ready

13:48.566 --> 13:50.394
to go back to work
after what happened.

13:50.438 --> 13:53.136
I mean, who would I trust
to watch Astrid?

13:53.180 --> 13:55.269
I mean, I chose a bar around
the corner from our apartment,

13:55.312 --> 13:57.053
and I've already texted
my husband five times

13:57.097 --> 13:58.707
to make sure she's okay.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.056
Can I give you a little advice

14:00.100 --> 14:01.536
that my Grandmother Amalia
used to give me?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.539
Just 'cause you go on a date

14:04.582 --> 14:06.410
does not mean
you have to get married.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.021
Take the meeting.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.635
Every witness the prosecutor's
gonna put on the stand today

14:13.678 --> 14:16.943
is there to try to establish one
thing-- that you have a temper.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.902
Listen, whatever anyone says
in that courtroom,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.991
your job is to not react.

14:22.035 --> 14:25.603
Because
if you give that jury an excuse

14:25.647 --> 14:27.257
to believe anything
that they hear, it...

14:27.301 --> 14:29.477
[phone ringing]Ah.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.435
It's Billy.
I think he's trying

14:31.479 --> 14:32.828
to find us.
Excuse me. [Astrid crying]

14:32.872 --> 14:34.874
[crying]

14:34.917 --> 14:35.875
[Astrid crying]

14:35.918 --> 14:37.180
Turn around!

14:38.138 --> 14:40.009
[gunshot][elevator bell dings]

14:40.053 --> 14:42.969
JACKSON:Billy.Hey. Sorry.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.884
The security line was crazy.Thanks.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.668
Uh, Mr. Palmer,
Dr. Bull,

14:46.711 --> 14:48.235
this is my brother Billy.Good to meet you.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.280
Thank you
for taking on my brother's case.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.673
Glad you could make it.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.154
CHUNK:
Yeah, um, we should
really get in there.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.199
Yeah? This way.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.637
You coming?

14:59.681 --> 15:01.596
Give me a minute.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.859
[gasps softly]

15:05.687 --> 15:08.298
[exhales sharply]

15:09.343 --> 15:11.345
[exhales sharply]

15:12.999 --> 15:14.391
REED:
Yes. I played football
with Jackson

15:14.435 --> 15:16.393
during our junior
and senior years of high school.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.656
WEISS:
Did you witness Jackson Martin

15:18.700 --> 15:20.658
having any anger issues
during that time?

15:20.702 --> 15:22.312
Yeah, Jackson lost his temper

15:22.356 --> 15:24.271
at football practice
plenty of times.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.316
He could be a
real hothead.How so?

15:26.360 --> 15:27.752
He'd yell,

15:27.796 --> 15:29.537
he'd rough you up on the field.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.495
Things had to go his way,
or he went ballistic.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.584
BULL:
Juror number nine
is devouring

15:33.628 --> 15:35.891
everything Reed's saying.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.937
Did you ever see him lose
his temper with Sarah Norris?

15:37.980 --> 15:39.068
Yes.

15:39.112 --> 15:40.461
I'll never forget it.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.550
There was this one time
the two of them got into it

15:42.593 --> 15:44.291
in the hallway,
and I don't know

15:44.334 --> 15:45.814
what she did to tick him off,

15:45.857 --> 15:48.730
but he pushed her up
against a locker, hard,

15:48.773 --> 15:51.994
and he was screaming at her
an inch from her face.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.605
Dude was unhinged.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.912
WEISS:
Nothing further.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.049
You graduated over 20 years ago
from high school.

16:03.092 --> 16:05.094
Is that correct?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.053
[clears throat]
Yeah. Yes.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.619
Are you certain
that you're remembering

16:08.663 --> 16:10.186
the confrontation correctly?

16:10.230 --> 16:12.232
I mean, it was a long time ago,
right?

16:12.275 --> 16:13.755
I'm positive.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.626
Memory's like a vault.

16:16.671 --> 16:18.629
A vault. O-Okay.

16:18.673 --> 16:21.937
Your Honor, I would like to
enter into evidence Exhibit A.

16:23.591 --> 16:26.986
Yeah, Sarah and Jackson
fought sometimes.

16:27.029 --> 16:30.467
Um, I think I remember
them yelling at each other

16:30.511 --> 16:32.600
in the halls at school once.

16:32.643 --> 16:34.384
VANESSA:
Was that it?

16:34.428 --> 16:37.170
Sarah and Jackson were
just yelling? Nothing else?

16:37.213 --> 16:38.823
No, I don't think so.

16:40.086 --> 16:42.436
Do you recall this portion
of your interview

16:42.479 --> 16:44.916
for the When Rich Boys Kill
docuseries?

16:46.440 --> 16:48.050
Yeah.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.445
It's interesting. They didn't
include this part in the series.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.013
Let's-let's watch
a little bit more.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.492
VANESSA:
Are you sure, Reed?

16:55.536 --> 16:58.234
Because another classmate
remembers it differently.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.062
Oh, yeah? What did they say?

17:00.106 --> 17:02.108
Let's cut.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.807
For the record,
the video cuts out

17:05.850 --> 17:08.070
at 10:14 a.m.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.771
For the record,

17:13.815 --> 17:17.906
the time code now reads
11:07 a.m.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.952
REED:
Jackson and Sarah got into it

17:20.996 --> 17:22.998
in the halls
at school one time.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.348
I don't know what she did
to tick him off,

17:25.392 --> 17:28.047
but Jackson went crazy on Sarah.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.484
He pushed her up
against the locker, hard,

17:30.527 --> 17:33.530
and he was screaming
at her an inch from her face.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.490
Dude was unhinged.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.492
[Chunk laughs softly]

17:38.535 --> 17:43.105
What happened during
that 53 minutes, Mr. Johnson?

17:43.149 --> 17:45.803
Why did you remember the fight

17:45.847 --> 17:47.675
between Sarah
and Jackson differently?

17:47.718 --> 17:50.591
Um, I-I don't know.
I don't remember.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.202
Oh. Now you don't remember?

17:53.246 --> 17:55.639
Did the producer
of the docuseries,

17:55.683 --> 17:57.641
Ms. Vanessa Voss,

17:57.685 --> 18:00.079
coach you to remember the fight
differently?

18:03.604 --> 18:05.606
I don't remember.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.347
Like a vault, huh?

18:07.390 --> 18:09.349
No further questions,
Your Honor.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.133
BULL:
You think juror number nine
feels as betrayed

18:11.177 --> 18:13.179
about the docuseries
as she did about Santa?

18:13.222 --> 18:14.702
MARISSA:
Well,

18:14.745 --> 18:18.053
Rudolph's red nose
is starting to fade.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.707
MAN:Jackson!Okay. Just keep walking.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.317
Keep walking.
Where's your car?WOMAN: Justice for Sarah!

18:21.361 --> 18:22.710
There it is right there.Okay, just keep moving.

18:22.753 --> 18:23.798
Okay. All right.Murderer!

18:23.841 --> 18:25.060
I know you killed
that girl.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.627
I know you killed that girl.Didn't touch her.

18:26.670 --> 18:27.976
I know you killed her.All right. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

18:28.019 --> 18:29.543
Watch it. Watch it.Like knocking women around,

18:29.586 --> 18:31.284
tough guy?Hey, hey, hey.

18:31.327 --> 18:32.546
Back off!Take it easy. Let's go.

18:32.589 --> 18:33.895
Don't touch me, man.MAN: You're guilty!

18:33.938 --> 18:36.027
Hey!No, no, no. Move it!

18:36.071 --> 18:37.203
Move it! Move it!JACKSON: I'm sorry. Sorry.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.595
CHUCK: Get in the car!BULL: Keep moving.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.554
Get in the car!MAN:
You're going down, Jackson!

18:40.597 --> 18:42.338
VANESSA:Wow. Looks like
Jackson Martin

18:42.382 --> 18:45.254
has a violent temper after all.MAN:
Give him the chair!

18:51.565 --> 18:53.088
[recording squealing,
footsteps approaching]

18:53.132 --> 18:54.829
DANNY:
Wanted to see me?Yeah.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.178
Check this out.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.962
[recording squealing]

18:58.006 --> 18:59.225
[grunting, indistinct shouting]

18:59.268 --> 19:00.748
Oh. Hmm.

19:00.791 --> 19:04.534
He's got a solid right hook
for a pretty boy.

19:04.578 --> 19:07.407
You so sure he didn't use this
on Sarah Norris?

19:07.450 --> 19:09.191
You don't like him, do you?

19:09.235 --> 19:10.497
Does it matter?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.890
[sighs]
I guess not.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.589
This is already at 200,000 hits
and climbing.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.982
I can't risk having Jackson
getting provoked again.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.984
I want you on him,
starting tomorrow.

19:20.028 --> 19:22.073
You want me to
babysit this guy?

19:22.117 --> 19:23.988
I know he's been accused
of murder, but if

19:24.032 --> 19:26.295
that makes you uncomfortable,
I can hire security.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.644
Please. I was undercover

19:27.688 --> 19:29.385
with the Vega brothers
for almost a year.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.171
I think I can handle the
Prince of Park Avenue.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.435
Oh, by the way, don't say that

19:35.478 --> 19:38.089
to his...To his face. Yeah, got it.

19:38.133 --> 19:41.615
PAZ:
I was the lead detective on
the original case back in '99.

19:41.658 --> 19:43.225
Back then,
we didn't have Sarah's body,

19:43.269 --> 19:44.487
so it was
a missing person's case.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.620
But after 48 hours,

19:46.663 --> 19:48.622
a girl like that,
from a good home--

19:48.665 --> 19:50.232
she didn't seem like
the kind of girl

19:50.276 --> 19:52.365
that would just take
off like that, so,

19:52.408 --> 19:53.801
you just know.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.150
WEISS:
And at the time,
did you have a prime suspect?

19:55.194 --> 19:57.631
Jackson Martin, the boyfriend.

19:57.674 --> 20:01.112
They'd had a nasty
public break-up.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.985
Unfortunately, I only had one
opportunity to interview him.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.334
Why is that?

20:05.378 --> 20:08.250
Well, his father, Lyle Martin,

20:08.294 --> 20:09.730
paid a visit to my lieutenant.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.123
He was in the office
for about an hour.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.691
After he left,
my lieutenant informed me

20:14.735 --> 20:16.432
that Jackson is no longer
a suspect

20:16.476 --> 20:18.173
in Sarah's disappearance.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.088
Did he give you a reason why?

20:20.131 --> 20:22.090
No, but about a week later,

20:22.133 --> 20:24.832
my lieutenant leaves for
a two-week vacation to CancÃºn.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.616
You tell me how
he can afford to do that

20:26.660 --> 20:27.965
on a cop's salary.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.358
Objection, Your Honor.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.925
This is speculation.

20:30.968 --> 20:32.927
Maybe the lieutenant
was a good saver,

20:32.970 --> 20:35.016
went off on one of
those time-share gambits.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.887
Detective Paz has no way
of knowing.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.020
I get it, Counselor.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.282
Sustained.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.197
Stick to the facts, Detective.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.504
WEISS:
Other than the timing

20:44.547 --> 20:47.507
of Lyle Martin's visit
and your lieutenant's vacation,

20:47.550 --> 20:49.900
was there any other fact
that made you think

20:49.944 --> 20:51.772
those two events were connected?

20:51.815 --> 20:53.817
Yes, there was.

20:53.861 --> 20:57.299
A week after my lieutenant
came back from his family trip,

20:57.343 --> 20:59.562
his wife stopped by the office
to take him to lunch.

20:59.606 --> 21:03.087
She had a keychain
from the Martin Hotel in CancÃºn.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.611
They didn't stay
at a time-share.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.787
Objection,
Your Honor, not only

21:06.830 --> 21:09.877
is this blatant speculation,
it's highly inflammatory.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.357
Overruled.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.054
I'll allow it this time.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.796
The jury can draw
their own conclusions.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.453
We've just lost
juror number nine.

21:20.496 --> 21:22.019
Yeah, not just number nine.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.413
I am looking
at the Red Sea right now.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.424
Did you know that
Dad paid off that lieutenant?

21:35.468 --> 21:36.817
No, I had no idea.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.558
Okay, let's not
do this here.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.603
So to avoid another incident,

21:40.647 --> 21:43.214
my investigator, Danny James, is
gonna meet us at the back door

21:43.258 --> 21:44.564
and drive you home.

21:44.607 --> 21:46.130
Billy, I'm putting you
on the stand tomorrow.

21:46.174 --> 21:48.132
Your alibi now is
more important than ever.

21:48.176 --> 21:49.743
So Dr. Bull and I want
to take you straight

21:49.786 --> 21:51.266
to TAC and prep you.
Is that okay?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.441
Of course.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.357
You lied to me.Mrs. Norris...

21:55.401 --> 21:56.750
All those years
when you swore to me

21:56.793 --> 21:58.708
that you...
you didn't hurt her?

21:58.752 --> 22:00.841
I didn't.
I swear to you...Don't you dare

22:00.884 --> 22:02.843
lie to me again.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.845
If you didn't hurt my Sarah,

22:04.888 --> 22:07.761
then why did your dad
pay off the police?

22:07.804 --> 22:11.417
And you-- how much of Daddy's
money are you getting?

22:11.460 --> 22:15.290
I hope it's worth letting
my daughter's killer go free.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.336
I'm done. Let's go.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.731
WOMAN:
Jamie Fraser is
the King of Men.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.865
He's by far the sexiest
Outlandercharacter. Full stop.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.128
WOMAN 2:
Come on. Show Frank some love.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.695
The man is brilliant and loyal.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.044
He's in denial.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.393
Admit it. That is totally hot.

22:31.437 --> 22:33.264
Frank isn't good enough
to iron Jamie's kilt.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.049
WOMAN:
Frank is so damn loyal,
he's a lapdog.

22:35.092 --> 22:36.572
Who stays with a woman

22:36.616 --> 22:39.488
who doesn't love him and is
carrying another man's baby?

22:39.532 --> 22:41.621
Oh, hell no.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.971
[distant horn honks]

22:44.014 --> 22:46.147
[distant chatter]

22:46.190 --> 22:49.368
Hey. Think that hat
makes you incognito?

22:49.411 --> 22:51.370
[horn honking]I'm hungry.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.893
Order DoorDash.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.331
I am going nuts up there,

22:56.375 --> 22:59.595
watching my life play out
on a 24/7 news cycle.

22:59.639 --> 23:02.729
You see that van
at the end of the street?

23:02.772 --> 23:03.904
That's TMZ.

23:03.947 --> 23:05.427
They're just waiting for someone

23:05.471 --> 23:08.212
to provoke you so that they can
get a fresh new story

23:08.256 --> 23:10.127
for their news cycle.

23:10.171 --> 23:14.436
Well, I only see one solution
to the problem we're having.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.743
I didn't know what you liked,

23:16.786 --> 23:18.571
so I got one
of everything.

23:18.614 --> 23:21.095
Hmm. Spendy.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.966
What was that?

23:23.010 --> 23:26.796
Nothing.
Just, um, whatever's good.

23:28.058 --> 23:31.758
You planning on whipping out
a search warrant?

23:31.801 --> 23:33.107
[laughs]

23:33.150 --> 23:34.848
Because the police already
came through here.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.850
They did a pretty
thorough job of it.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.852
Just doing my thing.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.549
That Bolognese?

23:40.593 --> 23:42.595
Yeah.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.598
Hmm.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.084
[distant sirens blaring]

23:55.085 --> 23:57.000
You think I did
it, don't you?

23:57.044 --> 23:59.046
I mean, hey, I get it.

23:59.089 --> 24:02.136
Even my own father thought
I did.

24:02.179 --> 24:05.487
You really didn't know about
your dad paying off that cop?

24:05.531 --> 24:07.489
You know, it's bad enough

24:07.533 --> 24:10.361
strangers think
that I killed Sarah.

24:10.405 --> 24:13.887
But knowing my dad died
believing that?

24:16.890 --> 24:19.458
Uh-oh. Damn it.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.504
Oh, I got some soda water
in the fridge.

24:22.548 --> 24:24.550
[distant sirens]

24:29.555 --> 24:31.513
Is that you and your dad?

24:31.557 --> 24:33.472
Yeah. He was my hero.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.039
What's going on
with your shoulder there?

24:36.083 --> 24:38.041
Oh, I messed it
up pretty bad.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.956
[phone camera shutter clicks]Torn rotator cuff.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.350
Had to sit out the rest
of the football season.

24:42.393 --> 24:44.395
It happened during the game?

24:44.439 --> 24:48.574
After. I got in a fight
with the QB from the other team.

24:48.617 --> 24:50.750
When people say
I was a hothead in high school,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.795
they're not wrong.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.972
I never touched Sarah.

24:56.016 --> 24:58.366
Never.

24:58.409 --> 25:01.021
But I could be
a bit of a dick back then.

25:03.197 --> 25:05.982
And now?

25:06.026 --> 25:08.115
Well, I'm not Gandhi,

25:08.158 --> 25:10.987
but I'm not the same
guy I was back then.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.820
Sarah disappeared
a few weeks after that fight.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.999
I guess losing her
gave me a little perspective

25:23.043 --> 25:25.306
as to what's worth
getting worked up over.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.003
You know?

25:29.005 --> 25:30.790
If your brother didn't kill
Sarah Norris,

25:30.833 --> 25:33.662
then why did your father pay off
the police lieutenant?

25:33.706 --> 25:35.272
I don't believe
he did pay him off.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.579
That's just
one cop's speculation.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.625
Because it's a fact

25:39.668 --> 25:42.671
that your father went to the
police station, and soon after,

25:42.715 --> 25:45.979
the police dropped
the investigation into Jackson.

25:46.022 --> 25:47.371
Isn't... isn't that correct?

25:47.415 --> 25:48.938
I guess.

25:48.982 --> 25:50.679
Never say "I guess."

25:50.723 --> 25:52.594
You need to be firm
in all of your answers.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.161
Anything that sounds
like a hedge,

25:54.204 --> 25:56.598
and the jury is going
to start losing trust.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.644
Okay. Thanks.

26:01.864 --> 26:03.823
Uh,

26:03.866 --> 26:07.348
my father hated scandal,

26:07.391 --> 26:09.568
gossip.

26:09.611 --> 26:13.180
I believe he went to
the lieutenant to talk to him,

26:13.223 --> 26:15.661
to quiet these false rumors
about my brother.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.750
That's all.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.579
Billy, where were you the night
Sarah was murdered?

26:20.622 --> 26:22.885
A bunch of us from school
were at a party that night,

26:22.929 --> 26:24.887
in the Village.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.759
But after Sarah broke up
with Jackson,

26:26.802 --> 26:28.891
he wanted to get out of there,
so I drove him out

26:28.935 --> 26:30.980
to our vacation home
in the Hamptons.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.940
We had some whiskey
and a few beers,

26:33.983 --> 26:36.595
and passed out
on the sofas there.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.554
And Jackson was with you
for the rest of the night?

26:39.598 --> 26:41.208
Yes.Are you sure?

26:41.251 --> 26:42.731
'Cause you admit you had a lot
to drink that night.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.690
Whiskey, beer?
Isn't that correct?

26:44.733 --> 26:46.866
Yes.That can put you into
a pretty deep sleep.

26:46.909 --> 26:50.217
Maybe while you were sleeping,
Jackson got to thinking

26:50.260 --> 26:52.219
about how angry he was
with Sarah for dumping him,

26:52.262 --> 26:54.047
and he decided
to do something about it.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.744
And then he snuck back in

26:55.788 --> 26:57.964
before you even
knew the difference.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.574
No way.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.967
I-I would've woken up.

27:01.010 --> 27:03.752
The gravel on our driveway
out there is super loud.

27:03.796 --> 27:06.320
And, besides, Jackson wouldn't
have hurt Sarah.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.669
He just never would've.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.844
How do you know that?

27:08.888 --> 27:10.890
I just know.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.893
I... I know my brother.

27:13.936 --> 27:17.636
And I saw his face when I got
home from work the next day.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.681
When he told me
Sarah was missing,

27:19.725 --> 27:21.465
he was completely white,
like a ghost.

27:21.509 --> 27:24.033
I... I had never seen him
that upset.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.905
Jackson told you
Sarah was missing

27:25.948 --> 27:27.428
after you got home from work?

27:27.471 --> 27:30.474
Yeah. When I got home
from the club where I caddied.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.998
He told me what happened.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.695
That's interesting,
'cause Jackson told us

27:33.739 --> 27:35.697
your father told the both of you

27:35.741 --> 27:38.613
at the same time when
you got back from the Hamptons.

27:40.397 --> 27:44.184
You weren't with Jackson
that night, were you?

27:46.012 --> 27:49.406
It-it doesn't matter.
I know he didn't do it.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.890
Yeah.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.936
We can't let him testify, Bull.

27:56.979 --> 27:59.242
What? No.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.462
You said Jackson needs my alibi.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.638
I'll-I'll get it straight,
I promise, but you have

28:03.682 --> 28:05.640
to put me on the stand.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.250
I know
my brother didn't do this.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.949
You-you... you can't
let him go to prison.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.777
Well, he just might
end up there.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.648
You're not taking the stand.

28:19.219 --> 28:21.090
JACKSON: Look, I know
what you must be thinking.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.831
Well, I know
what a jury would be thinking

28:22.875 --> 28:26.182
if your alibi fell apart
in front of them in court.

28:26.226 --> 28:29.055
Don't lie to me. I can't
help you if you lie to me.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.231
I'm sorry.

28:31.274 --> 28:32.798
[sighs]

28:32.841 --> 28:34.930
So if you weren't with Billy
that night, where were you?

28:34.974 --> 28:37.280
No, Billy and I did leave
the party together.No. No,

28:37.324 --> 28:39.195
Jackson, don't lie to me.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.545
Billy and I did leave
the party together,

28:41.589 --> 28:43.809
and then I realized
I just wanted to be alone,

28:43.852 --> 28:46.637
so I went to our parents' home
in the Hamptons, solo.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.639
[phone ringing]

28:48.683 --> 28:51.164
Will you turn
that damn phone off?

28:51.207 --> 28:53.644
Sorry. It's-it's Billy.

28:53.688 --> 28:55.777
He keeps calling me.
He's freaking out.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.605
Well, Billy can wait.

28:57.648 --> 29:00.042
I chose to represent you
because I believed you.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.479
I'm usually pretty good
at reading these things,

29:02.523 --> 29:04.220
but right now,
my antenna's a little bent.

29:04.264 --> 29:08.398
So, if you want me to help you,
you got to give me something.

29:08.442 --> 29:12.751
You got to make me
believe you again.

29:12.794 --> 29:15.492
I am not representing a guy

29:15.536 --> 29:18.278
who took someone's daughter
from them.

29:18.321 --> 29:21.063
I don't know what to give you,
but the plain truth is,

29:21.107 --> 29:24.240
Billy is the only one who
ever really believed in me.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.113
That's why he wanted
to give me an alibi.[sighs]

29:29.506 --> 29:32.379
It was Billy's idea
to alibi you?Yeah.

29:32.422 --> 29:35.251
Yeah. He said it was the
only way he could protect me.

29:36.426 --> 29:40.126
I'm the older brother, but
he's always tried to protect me.

29:42.476 --> 29:44.478
Excuse me. Could I have
another dirty martini, please?

29:44.521 --> 29:45.871
Extra olives.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.265
Okay, don't judge me until
you've had to watch three hours

29:49.309 --> 29:52.791
of PAW Patrolwhile your friend
gets ready for a job interview.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.705
I'll make it a double.

29:54.749 --> 29:57.447
IZZY:
Well, when it comes
to the beauty industry,

29:57.491 --> 29:59.972
everyone focuses
on Western Europe.

30:00.015 --> 30:03.453
But Russia is not only
a massive market,

30:03.497 --> 30:04.933
Russian women spend up

30:04.977 --> 30:08.545
to 30% of their income
on beauty products.

30:08.589 --> 30:12.593
I established great connections
in St. Petersburg

30:12.636 --> 30:16.162
when I took
Bella ColÃ³n Brands global,

30:16.205 --> 30:18.904
so getting Shimmer off
the ground there--

30:18.947 --> 30:20.862
it won't be a problem.

30:20.906 --> 30:24.866
What do we have to do to get you
to come on board as our new CEO?

30:24.910 --> 30:26.781
[music plays quietly]

30:30.045 --> 30:33.657
There's another offer.
Of course there is.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.007
Okay.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.705
âª No, I ain't a compass,
I don't got directions âª

30:37.748 --> 30:39.359
âª I don't even got
a bodyguard... âª

30:39.402 --> 30:41.970
âª 'Cause I don't really
need protection âª

30:42.014 --> 30:44.886
âª Expectations
feel like seasons... âªMm.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.975
That's... [laughs]

30:47.019 --> 30:48.020
a lot of zeros.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.500
So do we have a deal?

30:50.544 --> 30:52.154
âª 'Cause I don't really
need protection âª

30:52.198 --> 30:55.201
âª Expectations feel
like seasons. âª

30:55.244 --> 30:57.203
CHUNK:
Maybe we just have
to face the fact

30:57.246 --> 30:58.682
that Jackson did it.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.250
See if the A.D.A. is willing
to offer us a deal.

31:01.294 --> 31:03.122
I don't think Jackson did it.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.168
Check out this photo.

31:07.343 --> 31:08.910
Look at his right shoulder.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.913
He's wearing a brace?A torn rotator cuff.

31:11.957 --> 31:15.525
An injury he got a few weeks
before Sarah disappeared.

31:15.569 --> 31:18.224
CHUCK:
Is he right-handed?DANNY: Yes.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.921
I know that injury. It's bad.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.488
That fresh, there's no way

31:21.531 --> 31:23.490
that Jackson would have been
able to carry Sarah's body,

31:23.533 --> 31:26.319
let alone dig a hole
at that construction site

31:26.362 --> 31:27.842
deep enough to dump it in.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.932
We could get an expert witness
to testify to that, right?

31:30.976 --> 31:33.717
Yeah, yeah, but the prosecutor's
just gonna assert

31:33.761 --> 31:36.503
that he could've had someone
help him get rid of the body,

31:36.546 --> 31:39.114
someone like his father
or his brother.

31:39.158 --> 31:42.204
Well, if Jackson's innocent,

31:42.248 --> 31:44.380
why would his father go
to pay off the cops?

31:44.424 --> 31:46.600
Why would his brother
make up an alibi?

31:46.643 --> 31:48.384
Well, maybe they knew
that he would look guilty

31:48.428 --> 31:49.864
after that fight
with Sarah.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.213
They were trying
to protect him.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.128
Maybe they weren't trying
to protect Jackson.

31:53.172 --> 31:56.131
Maybe somebody else
needed an alibi.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.959
You think Billy did it?

31:58.003 --> 31:59.961
Well, you saw him.

32:00.005 --> 32:02.746
He is certain
that Jackson is innocent,

32:02.790 --> 32:05.749
and he is desperate
to keep him out of prison.

32:05.793 --> 32:08.056
And maybe that's because

32:08.100 --> 32:10.580
he knows
who really killed Sarah.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.582
That's a hell of a theory.

32:12.626 --> 32:14.062
Any idea how we prove it?

32:15.150 --> 32:17.936
I read on your website
you like a chai latte.

32:17.979 --> 32:19.938
May I have a seat?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.768
I was surprised
to hear from you, Dr. Bull.

32:24.812 --> 32:28.729
And in my experience,
I don't like your surprises.

32:28.772 --> 32:31.471
Well, your audience likes
a good surprise, don't they?

32:31.514 --> 32:34.082
A-a certain twist,
if you will?

32:34.126 --> 32:35.736
Mm, I deal in facts.

32:35.779 --> 32:38.217
If the facts have twists,
then all the better.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.742
A high school boyfriend murders
his high school sweetheart.

32:41.785 --> 32:44.266
Not too surprising in
the scheme of things.

32:44.310 --> 32:47.052
We all have seen that
before, haven't we?

32:48.096 --> 32:51.491
But what if I could offer you
a truly shocking twist?

32:53.058 --> 32:55.060
I'm listening.

33:00.630 --> 33:02.632
âª

33:06.941 --> 33:09.552
How did you get Billy
to agree to do this?

33:09.596 --> 33:11.424
Well, I just told him the truth.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.817
We can't put him on the stand.
He'll perjure himself.

33:13.861 --> 33:18.387
So, this is the only way
he can protect his brother.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.563
VANESSA:
Tell me about
the party that night.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.044
Did you witness the fight
between Jackson and Sarah?

33:23.088 --> 33:25.742
Yes. And Jackson was mad,

33:25.786 --> 33:28.702
but he was also drunk
and just being stupid.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.834
And that's why when he wanted
to get out of there,

33:30.878 --> 33:32.314
I went with him-- to make sure

33:32.358 --> 33:34.708
he wouldn't do anything
more stupid, like drive drunk.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.884
And did you see Sarah
leave the party?

33:36.927 --> 33:41.541
No. When we left, Sarah was
still there, still alive.

33:41.584 --> 33:44.979
So where did you and Jackson go
after you left the party?

33:45.023 --> 33:47.764
We drove to my parents' house
in the Hamptons.

33:48.896 --> 33:51.116
I mean, I-I drove.And what route

33:51.159 --> 33:53.248
did you take to the Hamptons?

33:53.292 --> 33:57.078
We took 27. That's really
the only route you can take.

33:59.472 --> 34:00.864
Now, did you know,

34:00.908 --> 34:03.432
there are no tolls on Route 27?

34:03.476 --> 34:05.826
Um... sure.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.437
But do you know
where there are tolls?

34:08.481 --> 34:10.657
The Verrazano Bridge.

34:10.700 --> 34:13.094
You know,
the bridge you'd take

34:13.138 --> 34:15.575
if you were, say, coming back

34:15.618 --> 34:18.665
from the Martin Hotel site
in Staten Island.

34:20.536 --> 34:21.929
If you say so.

34:21.972 --> 34:23.757
I'm just curious.
If you and your brother

34:23.800 --> 34:26.455
were in the car together
on Route 27,

34:26.499 --> 34:29.110
why do I have a photo of you,
in your car,

34:29.154 --> 34:32.070
alone,
crossing the Verrazano Bridge

34:32.113 --> 34:37.423
on October 17, 1999,

34:37.466 --> 34:39.686
the same night
that Sarah Norris was murdered,

34:39.729 --> 34:42.950
the same night her body was
dumped at that hotel site?

34:43.994 --> 34:46.084
I have, um...

34:47.302 --> 34:49.522
I'm sorry.
I-I... I need some water.

34:55.180 --> 34:56.964
Billy?

34:57.007 --> 34:59.009
Did you know
she had that photo of me?

34:59.053 --> 35:00.489
No, of course not.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.187
I mean, were they even
taking pictures

35:02.230 --> 35:03.884
at toll booths 22 years ago?

35:03.927 --> 35:06.408
I have no idea, Billy.
Is it a problem?

35:06.452 --> 35:08.541
What's going on?

35:08.584 --> 35:10.282
I mean, you got
to talk to me here.

35:10.325 --> 35:12.806
I can't go back out there.You don't have

35:12.849 --> 35:14.373
to go back out there.

35:14.416 --> 35:16.940
Just tell me what's going on
so I can help you.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.942
[panting]

35:18.986 --> 35:21.031
I didn't mean to.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.468
It was an accident.

35:22.511 --> 35:24.078
Okay.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.690
Sometimes bad things happen
even when we don't want them to.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.518
I felt bad.

35:29.562 --> 35:32.652
Jackson yelled at Sarah in front
of everyone at the party.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.133
And so, I-I went back,

35:35.176 --> 35:37.135
just to make sure she was okay.

35:37.178 --> 35:38.571
And I saw her walking home.

35:38.614 --> 35:42.792
She was drunk, crying,
so I offered her a ride.

35:42.836 --> 35:45.665
She was telling me
what a jerk Jackson was,

35:45.708 --> 35:48.537
and I thought-- I don't know--

35:48.581 --> 35:52.367
maybe she liked me a little.

35:52.411 --> 35:55.414
I wanted...

35:55.457 --> 35:57.633
I just wanted to kiss her.

35:57.677 --> 35:59.418
What are you doing?! Gross!

35:59.461 --> 36:01.333
I was just trying
to be nice to her,

36:01.376 --> 36:03.117
and she treated me like garbage.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.380
BILLY:
Oh, come on. I'm sorry.

36:05.424 --> 36:07.034
I-I won't do that again.

36:07.077 --> 36:08.557
Just get back in the car.

36:08.601 --> 36:10.777
Are you kidding? I can't
believe you did that.

36:10.820 --> 36:13.127
I'm gonna tell Jackson.Please,

36:13.171 --> 36:14.302
don't tell my brother.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.086
Promise me you won't tell him.

36:16.130 --> 36:17.305
Get off of me, you perv!

36:17.349 --> 36:19.873
Get off of me! Get off!

36:21.266 --> 36:23.920
Oh, crap. You okay?

36:23.964 --> 36:25.661
Sarah?

36:25.705 --> 36:27.446
There was so much blood.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.012
I tried to stop the bleeding

36:29.056 --> 36:30.840
with her sweatshirt.Don't, Sarah...

36:30.884 --> 36:34.017
Jackson's sweatshirt-- but

36:34.061 --> 36:36.933
she was gone, just like that.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.109
I didn't know
what to do, so I...

36:39.153 --> 36:42.504
I put her in the back of my car.

36:42.548 --> 36:45.768
I called my father
from a pay phone.

36:45.812 --> 36:49.294
He came out and met me
at the hotel on Staten Island.

36:49.337 --> 36:52.122
He said we should
bury her there

36:52.166 --> 36:55.256
because the next day, they were
putting in the new floors

36:55.300 --> 36:58.041
to the pool house.

36:58.085 --> 37:00.740
Does Jackson know about this?

37:01.784 --> 37:03.743
No.

37:03.786 --> 37:05.788
We never told him.

37:08.487 --> 37:11.185
Did you guys get that?

37:12.926 --> 37:15.015
Y-You're wired?

37:15.058 --> 37:16.886
You can't do that.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.279
You're my lawyer.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.368
No, I'm not a lawyer,

37:20.412 --> 37:23.719
and I work for Jackson, not you.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.779
Hey.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.433
Oh, hey.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.522
I was just wrapping things up

37:43.565 --> 37:45.567
with Mr. Palmer and Dr. Bull.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.919
You heard my...
my brother was arrested?

37:49.963 --> 37:52.792
Yeah. How you doing?

37:52.835 --> 37:54.097
Well, I thought, uh,
people thinking

37:54.141 --> 37:55.490
that I killed Sarah was bad,

37:55.534 --> 37:56.709
but knowing Billy killed her

37:56.752 --> 37:58.319
and then lied to me
all these years--

37:58.363 --> 37:59.668
I don't know how
to process th...

37:59.712 --> 38:00.930
Y-You know, I'm sorry.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.845
You, uh... you probably

38:02.889 --> 38:04.891
just came to say goodbye, so...

38:04.934 --> 38:08.024
It's all right. What you're
going through really sucks.

38:09.374 --> 38:12.942
Everybody's been telling
your story all these years.

38:12.986 --> 38:15.989
At least now
you can finally tell your own.

38:17.730 --> 38:20.123
Yeah, that's true. Thank you.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.261
Oh, hey?

38:29.132 --> 38:31.309
Watch out for that Bolognese.

38:45.497 --> 38:46.933
[sighs]

38:47.977 --> 38:50.328
What's all this?

38:52.112 --> 38:56.464
Shimmer Health & Wellness
asked me to be their CEO.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.423
Wow!

38:58.466 --> 39:00.947
That's a big deal.
That's incredible.

39:00.990 --> 39:03.993
So, wait. Did this just
come out of the blue, or

39:04.037 --> 39:05.995
did you get asked
for an interview or...?

39:06.039 --> 39:09.956
I had dinner with the chair
of their board the other night.

39:09.999 --> 39:12.306
Did you?

39:14.352 --> 39:17.572
So... who was
watching Astrid?

39:17.616 --> 39:19.444
Marissa.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.751
She never mentioned that.

39:22.795 --> 39:26.799
Well, I didn't know if I wanted
it to be real or not. I...

39:26.842 --> 39:29.845
So, has it gotten real?

39:29.889 --> 39:34.154
Actually... I turned them down.

39:34.197 --> 39:38.941
It would've just meant
a ton of travel, and...

39:38.985 --> 39:42.597
I'm not ready to be away
from Astrid like that.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.339
So what's all this?

39:45.383 --> 39:49.822
This... is just a thought.

39:49.865 --> 39:53.347
Can I tell you more
when it's real?

39:56.872 --> 39:58.570
Of course you can.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.528
Hmm.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.749
How you doing at work?

40:03.792 --> 40:05.751
Why? Did Marissa
say something?

40:05.794 --> 40:09.189
No, no, no,
and trust me, I tried.

40:09.232 --> 40:13.933
I just... I kind of
like you, so I worry.

40:13.976 --> 40:15.978
Well, thank you.

40:18.285 --> 40:22.507
I guess, uh, I'm less angry,

40:22.550 --> 40:26.119
but I'm... anxious.

40:26.162 --> 40:29.165
Do you think this is like
the seven stages of grief?

40:29.209 --> 40:31.907
No, it's more like the
nine circles of hell, but...

40:31.951 --> 40:35.171
Oh, baby.The only way
out is through.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.783
You're gonna keep
working on this?

40:37.826 --> 40:40.176
I don't have to.

40:40.220 --> 40:43.005
No, I think it's
a good idea, and, um...

40:45.051 --> 40:49.229
I am gonna go...
try a thought.

40:50.622 --> 40:53.015
âª Just

40:53.059 --> 40:56.671
âª Let go [sighs]

40:58.412 --> 41:02.938
âª Breathe in slow

41:02.982 --> 41:06.464
[phone ringing]

41:06.507 --> 41:11.991
âª Heavy heart,
dreaming with the light on âª

41:12.034 --> 41:14.167
[phone continues ringing]

41:14.210 --> 41:19.433
âª Ask yourself,
is this the hill I die on? âª

41:20.826 --> 41:23.568
âª Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh,
you'll know âª

41:23.611 --> 41:28.050
âª Everything fades away

41:28.094 --> 41:34.100
âª Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh, always
chasing after yesterday... âª
