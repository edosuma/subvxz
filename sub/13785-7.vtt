01:41.416 --> 01:43.111
He's gone up
with your son.

01:43.151 --> 01:45.449
Wants notice when you're ready
to serve.

01:49.023 --> 01:50.991
I knocked holes
in these walls.

01:51.025 --> 01:53.823
Confinement gives me
the fidgets.

01:53.861 --> 01:56.295
Set yourself
up comfortable.

01:56.330 --> 01:58.730
Let me confide
as well, Odell,

01:58.833 --> 02:01.301
that when people only say to me
with other words

02:01.335 --> 02:04.463
what I have just said to them,
I quickly grow impatient.

02:04.505 --> 02:06.871
- All right, sir.
- Tell me about the gold.

02:06.908 --> 02:08.535
I will, sir...

02:08.576 --> 02:11.670
what little I know to say,
hoping you will learn me the rest.

02:11.712 --> 02:14.806
This is what they call an assay
and metallurgist report.

02:14.849 --> 02:17.750
Yes, I've heard
of those.

02:17.785 --> 02:19.616
Sit down, boy.
Sit down.

02:22.089 --> 02:25.786
"Third Baptist Congregation,
Monrovia Settlement."

02:25.827 --> 02:27.727
The congregation
has title to the find.

02:27.762 --> 02:29.855
How are you connected
to the congregation?

02:29.897 --> 02:33.697
- I'm first deacon, sir.
- I see. Congratulations.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.929
Being you were known to me
through my mama's letters,

02:35.970 --> 02:37.562
when the proposals
started to come to us...

02:37.605 --> 02:40.574
- Proposals?
- The different English proposals.

02:40.608 --> 02:42.439
From Great Britain,
you mean?

02:42.477 --> 02:44.672
To develop the find,
yes, sir.

02:44.712 --> 02:46.771
I was sent to ask
if you'd guide us.

02:46.814 --> 02:51.046
Does your congregation conceive
some sort of a partnership, Odell?

02:51.085 --> 02:53.053
However you thought
we should do.

02:53.087 --> 02:55.612
I do take in partners
with the understanding

02:55.656 --> 02:58.853
that in dealing with the color,
mine is the deciding voice.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.621
Dealing
with the color, sir?

03:00.661 --> 03:03.653
The gold... securing
and exploiting the gold.

03:04.765 --> 03:06.494
Do you want to see
the gold now, sir?

03:06.534 --> 03:10.026
- Do you want to show it to me?
- They give it to me to show you, sir.

03:10.071 --> 03:12.039
Suppose
we oughtn't...

03:12.073 --> 03:14.064
let the congregation
down.

03:25.820 --> 03:29.221
I can't imagine your mother's
not nearly prepared our supper.

03:30.157 --> 03:31.647
What do you think
of the gold?

03:31.692 --> 03:34.456
It makes me hungry,
Odell.

03:34.495 --> 03:36.190
Harry should be
at the meeting.

03:36.230 --> 03:39.256
I ain't saying he shouldn't.
I wasn't told to invite him.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.530
Candidate for public office.

03:41.569 --> 03:45.665
Please convey to Al
that short of being forbidden,

03:45.706 --> 03:47.697
I intend to bring
Harry with me.

03:47.742 --> 03:49.539
I'll convey that
word for word.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.511
And what would be
my position?

03:51.546 --> 03:54.379
Oughtn't I attend
as the livery's new owner?

03:54.415 --> 03:56.280
Hostetler
never attended.

03:56.317 --> 03:58.251
Prior to blowing off
his fucking head,

03:58.352 --> 03:59.979
Hostetler
was a nigger.

04:00.021 --> 04:02.581
Last I looked
I'm white!

04:02.623 --> 04:05.524
True, as far
as it goes.

04:05.560 --> 04:08.552
I can abstain from attending
if that closes the can of peas.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.759
You are a candidate
for public office

04:11.799 --> 04:14.700
with a chance to put
the fire wagon on the table.

04:14.735 --> 04:16.964
If it's a question
of room,

04:17.004 --> 04:19.267
shove two fucking
tables together!

04:19.307 --> 04:21.798
Room is not
the issue, Steve,

04:21.841 --> 04:24.538
if you have to see
my down card.

04:24.579 --> 04:26.240
I do not vouch
for you,

04:26.280 --> 04:30.182
nor presume to bring
you uninvited, as I do Harry,

04:30.217 --> 04:33.311
because you are not the same
quality person.

04:33.354 --> 04:36.050
Meaning
I'm not fanatic

04:36.090 --> 04:38.149
for fucking fire wagons
like Harry

04:38.192 --> 04:40.387
and all the other
five-year-olds.

04:40.428 --> 04:42.555
Anyways I've still got
the doc to invite.

04:42.597 --> 04:44.724
Is this the quickest
way to the cabin here...

04:44.765 --> 04:47.598
Tell Al add
an extra peach dish.

04:47.635 --> 04:51.127
Can you certify the purity
of your blood, Steve?

04:51.172 --> 04:55.370
I only ask because
your nose is... broad.

04:57.011 --> 04:59.912
Take your apron off, and consider
changing your shirt,

05:00.014 --> 05:03.040
which I fucking
suggested yesterday.

05:18.699 --> 05:21.099
Will you mind
very much

05:21.135 --> 05:23.262
if we have our dinner
quickly?

05:32.513 --> 05:34.447
Camp business, dear?

05:39.787 --> 05:41.948
Come to cases,

05:41.989 --> 05:44.355
I will get sent
to hire guns...

05:44.392 --> 05:46.485
quick time,

05:46.527 --> 05:48.324
bouncing in
the fucking saddle

05:48.362 --> 05:50.421
and howling at every
goddamn hoof-fall,

05:50.464 --> 05:52.125
aches
in every bone.

05:52.166 --> 05:55.329
- I put out cinnamon.
- Where?

05:55.369 --> 05:58.566
- The meeting table.
- On whose instruction?

05:58.673 --> 06:01.164
Cinnamon's good
with peaches.

06:01.208 --> 06:04.405
Do not put unauthorized cinnamon
on the goddamn meeting table.

06:04.445 --> 06:06.538
That's all
the fuck we need.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.571
It's available
as a choice.

06:08.616 --> 06:10.846
Which is not your province
to offer, Jewel.

06:10.885 --> 06:14.981
If food's not my province, then you
can make your own fucking breakfast.

06:15.022 --> 06:17.286
I had best not come out
of this goddamn kitchen

06:17.324 --> 06:20.122
and find goddamn cinnamon
on the fucking meeting table.

06:26.133 --> 06:28.397
Leg up to Cheyenne by now,
I'd be heading there

06:28.436 --> 06:30.336
in a civilized
fucking gait.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.406
Doc!

06:40.448 --> 06:42.575
Johnny Burns, Doc!

06:44.085 --> 06:46.019
You remember you-you
come to that...

06:46.053 --> 06:47.850
that meeting before

06:47.888 --> 06:50.823
to set the pest tent up
and the like?

06:50.858 --> 06:52.951
And E.B.
was made mayor?

06:58.332 --> 07:00.323
Hey, Doc.

07:02.470 --> 07:04.529
You can't talk?

07:04.572 --> 07:07.507
Anyway, Al's got another
of them meetings.

07:07.541 --> 07:09.532
You can't come?

07:15.583 --> 07:17.278
Jesus, Doc.

07:17.318 --> 07:19.912
All right, all right. I'll tell him...
you can't come.

07:19.954 --> 07:22.821
Anyway, look, I hope...
I hope you feel better.

07:49.984 --> 07:53.681
My best efforts, Odell, do not yet
persuade your mother

07:53.721 --> 07:56.588
to be indifferent to the opinions
of others.

07:56.624 --> 07:58.683
If it's all right
with you, Mr. Hearst,

07:58.793 --> 08:00.488
it's all all right with me.

08:00.528 --> 08:02.723
- This looks wonderful, Mama.
- Thank you.

08:13.240 --> 08:15.970
I suppose you've told your mama
about being first deacon

08:16.010 --> 08:17.807
of your congregation
in Liberia.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.939
I haven't yet had the chance
to give her the news.

08:20.981 --> 08:23.575
Does your congregation
have no strictures, Odell,

08:23.617 --> 08:25.551
against its deacons
drinking?

08:25.586 --> 08:27.451
It does, yes, sir.

08:27.488 --> 08:29.046
Yet the smell of liquor's
on your breath.

08:30.991 --> 08:32.822
Do I mistake?

08:32.860 --> 08:35.192
No, sir, Mr. Hearst,
you don't.

08:35.229 --> 08:37.754
Did you have one drink
of liquor, Odell,

08:37.798 --> 08:39.958
from nervousness
about our talk?

08:40.000 --> 08:41.695
- I admit I did, sir, yes.
- Did you drink

08:41.735 --> 08:43.293
on the ship
from Liberia?

08:43.337 --> 08:46.306
- No, sir.
- Or coming overland from New York?

08:46.340 --> 08:48.171
No, sir, Mr. Hearst.

08:48.209 --> 08:51.337
Would the liquor I smell then be
the first you've ever consumed?

08:54.615 --> 08:56.480
I've had some
before, sir.

08:56.517 --> 09:00.009
Prior to becoming deacon
of Third Baptist of Monrovia

09:00.120 --> 09:01.821
or after?

09:01.856 --> 09:03.847
I guess a little of both.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.359
Showing gold
thousands of miles

09:06.393 --> 09:09.294
from its purported source
to authenticate a find,

09:09.330 --> 09:12.595
I would associate less with our Savior's
qualities of character

09:12.633 --> 09:15.898
than Adam's, or someone pretending
to his innocence.

09:15.936 --> 09:17.904
Before he met
the serpent.

09:18.939 --> 09:20.497
Hmm.

09:20.541 --> 09:23.874
The combative note in that
pleases me, Odell,

09:23.911 --> 09:28.348
as against what till now
has seemed haphazard

09:28.382 --> 09:31.146
and sloven
and slipshod

09:31.185 --> 09:33.619
in your approach
to fleecing me.

09:33.654 --> 09:38.057
My mistake was thinking that you'd
want your niggers praising Jesus.

09:38.092 --> 09:41.061
What the hell are we
talking about this for?

09:41.095 --> 09:43.188
Did the assay
make sense or not?

09:43.230 --> 09:45.130
Ten dollars'll buy
a report

09:45.165 --> 09:48.191
that proves a find of pure ore
in your ass, Odell.

09:48.235 --> 09:51.534
I guess that's why I didn't figure
till you'd had someone over there,

09:51.572 --> 09:53.563
we'd be drawing up
any papers.

09:53.607 --> 09:56.735
Figured this'd be a
getting-to-know-each-other conversation,

09:56.777 --> 09:58.642
seeing if we'd want
to go any further.

09:58.679 --> 10:01.079
Far as I'm concerned,
we don't.

10:01.115 --> 10:04.607
Calm down.
Now just calm down, son.

10:05.986 --> 10:07.920
If I have mistook you
in some regard,

10:07.955 --> 10:10.116
you'll find I'm man enough
to apologize.

10:16.530 --> 10:19.590
Now, just sit down,

10:19.633 --> 10:21.498
we'll finish
our meal,

10:21.535 --> 10:25.403
and then maybe afterwards
we'll take in the camp

10:25.439 --> 10:28.840
and, if you have any vices beyond
your drinking,

10:28.876 --> 10:30.867
I might even
offer you a cigar.

10:44.158 --> 10:46.422
How's he doing?

10:46.460 --> 10:48.519
Holding
his fucking own.

10:54.134 --> 10:57.433
...then I asked, "What good am I
to myself or the camp

10:57.471 --> 10:59.769
standing sentinel
over a coffee pot?"

10:59.873 --> 11:02.706
was why I came home.

11:04.645 --> 11:06.340
I wish you wouldn't
smoke in here.

11:06.380 --> 11:09.349
I wish, when asleep, you wouldn't snore
and fucking fart.

11:09.383 --> 11:12.079
I have no choice
about either of those.

11:12.119 --> 11:14.610
If I extinguish
this fucking cigarette,

11:14.655 --> 11:17.055
it'll be in the middle
of your fucking forehead.

11:17.091 --> 11:19.616
Ah.

11:19.660 --> 11:22.185
I'm glad she
fucking fired me.

11:22.229 --> 11:23.924
I hate that fucking bank.

11:23.964 --> 11:25.898
It's the context, I think,
that disturbs you,

11:25.933 --> 11:28.026
that she's back
to using dope.

11:28.068 --> 11:30.536
Yes yes! That she's back
on the dope disturbs me.

11:30.571 --> 11:32.801
And why,
even as we speak,

11:32.840 --> 11:35.866
your own life hangs
by a fucking thread.

11:49.656 --> 11:51.590
What's to become
of that child?

11:53.227 --> 11:55.787
- Johnny Burns, Mr. Star!
- What is it?

11:55.829 --> 11:58.855
Well, Al's called a meeting
like the ones you've come to before.

11:58.966 --> 12:00.900
Does Sheriff Bullock
know?

12:00.934 --> 12:03.334
Seemed to me they halfway
called it together.

12:03.370 --> 12:04.735
All right,
I'm coming.

12:04.772 --> 12:07.764
If you ain't et
dessert yet, don't.

12:07.808 --> 12:11.266
- All right.
- Al's broke out the canned peaches.

12:11.311 --> 12:13.677
All right.

12:18.585 --> 12:20.576
The Bullocks
could take her.

12:22.823 --> 12:24.791
Or we could.

12:32.599 --> 12:35.067
You'd have us
care for a child?

12:44.778 --> 12:47.042
Now more than
previously, Sofia,

12:47.081 --> 12:49.049
Mr. Ellsworth will...

12:49.083 --> 12:51.551
spend time
at the diggings.

12:53.053 --> 12:55.180
Did he not come home
last night?

12:57.925 --> 13:00.086
I'm not sure,
darling.

13:01.261 --> 13:03.252
Possibly
he did not.

13:03.297 --> 13:06.562
And maybe that's why
you didn't waken.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.591
I didn't feel
his beard.

13:11.371 --> 13:13.396
Possibly
that's why.

13:16.009 --> 13:18.569
But he will be
seeing you.

13:28.555 --> 13:31.285
And everything
will be all right.

13:34.161 --> 13:37.153
I gave him a foolproof
fucking approach

13:37.197 --> 13:39.028
to wind up with
that woman's claim,

13:39.066 --> 13:41.261
and I could have been
shit drawing flies.

13:41.301 --> 13:43.565
Hearst is that
fucking focused

13:43.604 --> 13:45.333
on Bullock
pulling his ear.

13:46.340 --> 13:47.967
Yeah?

13:48.008 --> 13:49.805
All collected
but Doc.

13:49.843 --> 13:52.334
- Where the fuck is he?
- He ain't up to it, he says.

13:54.214 --> 13:56.876
- Cinnamon's out for the peaches.
- Huh?

13:56.917 --> 13:58.885
That wasn't
my fucking doing.

13:58.986 --> 14:02.478
Giving Hearst Bullock is the only move
that don't end with the camp in flames.

14:02.513 --> 14:05.220
And that one only
gets us up to 50-50.

14:14.101 --> 14:17.502
It sounds as if Cochran's turned
face to the wall.

14:17.538 --> 14:19.506
His fucking lungs.

14:19.540 --> 14:23.067
There's quite a falling off among
the other sawbones in camp.

14:23.110 --> 14:26.568
We might put notice
in the Eastern papers.

14:26.613 --> 14:29.047
Once we've ceased
our weeping.

14:32.486 --> 14:33.851
Got a meeting.

14:33.887 --> 14:36.549
Had he known
our might and guile,

14:36.590 --> 14:39.024
Hearst would have never
left the Comstock.

14:39.059 --> 14:41.857
Ernie, you got credit for a free tug
tomorrow. Let's go.

14:41.895 --> 14:45.228
I'll spank it myself.
Just watch me.

14:45.265 --> 14:47.927
You'll spank it in front of a goddamn
mule team.

14:47.968 --> 14:50.266
Sirs, if I
might explain.

14:50.304 --> 14:53.296
In my vision,
I leapt from the coach

14:53.340 --> 14:54.932
and straight
come to see him.

14:54.975 --> 14:56.875
Al's got a meeting
tonight, Gustave.

14:56.910 --> 14:58.878
Tell him your vision
tomorrow.

14:58.979 --> 15:01.140
Mr. Swearengen!

15:01.181 --> 15:03.479
It's just
as I imagined!

15:04.651 --> 15:06.744
I have something
so important to give to you.

15:06.787 --> 15:08.220
What?

15:08.255 --> 15:11.156
You mustn't ask me what.
And you mustn't ask me why.

15:11.191 --> 15:12.681
You must go
fuck yourself.

15:12.726 --> 15:14.660
And don't speak
disgusting to me

15:14.695 --> 15:16.458
or answer
for Mr. Swearengen

15:16.496 --> 15:18.487
what is a very
important answer.

15:18.532 --> 15:21.729
Let me know
when Bullock arrives.

15:22.936 --> 15:24.096
Ah.

15:25.973 --> 15:28.134
Oh, Tom Nuttall's coming
and he's bringing Harry Manning.

15:28.175 --> 15:30.075
Bullock!

15:34.414 --> 15:36.712
Guess if you've got a pussy,

15:36.750 --> 15:39.617
even owning a bank
don't get you to that table.

15:45.626 --> 15:48.424
Jesus Christ,
easy easy easy easy.

15:48.462 --> 15:50.862
There'll be conversations
left and right.

15:50.897 --> 15:54.162
Don't get too far up there
on the fucking wrist.

15:54.201 --> 15:57.568
- Do you want to use the sponge?
- That's not the fucking point.

15:57.604 --> 16:00.869
You just not be starting
length and breadth conversations

16:00.974 --> 16:03.671
throughout the fucking camp
or territory or so on.

16:03.706 --> 16:06.369
Or do I suppose now I take off
my fucking undershirt

16:06.413 --> 16:08.574
or the like and show
my tits and so forth!?

16:08.615 --> 16:10.947
I'll leave you
to wash that part.

16:10.984 --> 16:13.748
Who the fuck am I fucking kidding
or putting on airs in front of?

16:13.787 --> 16:17.052
I been disrobed
in front of every...

16:17.090 --> 16:19.615
barnyard creature
that hunts

16:19.660 --> 16:21.992
or pecks or rolls
in the fucking mud.

16:22.029 --> 16:25.396
Who the fuck should I have
shyness before

16:25.432 --> 16:27.730
or pride or the like,
for Christ's sake?

16:27.768 --> 16:29.668
What difference
does it make?

16:29.703 --> 16:32.797
What the fuck do I have to be ashamed of
at this late fucking date?

16:32.839 --> 16:34.830
Who cares anyway?!

16:38.512 --> 16:40.503
Now go ahead and sponge
my fucking tits

16:40.547 --> 16:42.811
and get it over with
if that's what you fucking do.

16:42.849 --> 16:44.476
It's nothing
like that, Jane.

16:44.518 --> 16:46.850
Well, what's it like then?
I never had a sister.

16:46.887 --> 16:48.878
I had two.

16:50.991 --> 16:53.289
And I slept
with both of them.

16:55.329 --> 16:57.490
I don't know why
God let me or...

16:58.799 --> 17:02.098
if He forgives me
when I pray, but...

17:02.135 --> 17:04.194
but I'd never
hurt you, Jane,

17:04.237 --> 17:05.897
or touch you
if you didn't want.

17:09.675 --> 17:11.701
I believe that.

17:11.744 --> 17:13.838
But I don't want
to open my eyes.

17:13.880 --> 17:17.474
But you can go ahead and kiss me
if that's what you fucking do.

17:36.303 --> 17:39.795
What possesses me to buy
all of these swatches?

17:39.840 --> 17:42.240
Even though I have
no reason why I should!

17:42.275 --> 17:44.903
Because who back
at that camp

17:44.945 --> 17:46.742
would wear suits
of such colors?

17:46.780 --> 17:50.181
But I have learned
sometimes

17:50.217 --> 17:54.051
if you have a thing, the reason
for the thing is that you have it!

17:54.087 --> 17:56.146
And when I am
in New York City,

17:56.189 --> 17:58.123
I have a letter
from a friend.

17:58.225 --> 18:00.420
In the news
from the camp, he says,

18:00.460 --> 18:02.428
"And Mr. Swearengen

18:02.462 --> 18:05.329
has lost the top part
of his middle finger

18:05.365 --> 18:07.265
to an accident
some kind."

18:07.300 --> 18:10.963
And I say, "I will
take these swatches

18:11.004 --> 18:14.906
to Mr. Swearengen,"
and, "I like the look of his vest

18:14.941 --> 18:17.466
when he is out
in the morning,

18:17.511 --> 18:21.106
out on the balcony,
drinking his coffee,

18:21.148 --> 18:24.345
and he is very much
a handsome man at those times,

18:24.384 --> 18:27.581
and maybe he would like
one for his stump.

18:27.621 --> 18:30.590
Or maybe more...
a different swatch

18:30.624 --> 18:32.592
for every day, why not?"

18:32.626 --> 18:35.527
Give me your stump. Don't think
about it. Just give it to me.

18:37.764 --> 18:39.959
Now this corner
of the swatch

18:40.000 --> 18:42.491
we pretend is
the lost child.

18:42.536 --> 18:46.028
The little boy goes
up the mountain,

18:46.072 --> 18:48.597
around the bend,

18:48.642 --> 18:51.270
always looking
for Mama.

18:51.311 --> 18:53.279
And where does he
finally find her?

18:53.313 --> 18:55.281
Where?

18:55.315 --> 18:57.408
Here she is!
Here's Mama!

18:57.451 --> 19:00.614
Wrapping herself
around you

19:00.720 --> 19:02.854
tight tight tight.

19:02.889 --> 19:05.949
Mama's got you, Little Al.
Everything's all right!

19:10.997 --> 19:14.398
I like that color
very very much.

19:14.434 --> 19:16.265
Do you?

19:17.304 --> 19:19.135
Please God,
come in.

19:21.408 --> 19:22.807
Bullock.

19:24.144 --> 19:26.271
Thank you, Gustave.
Please leave.

19:36.189 --> 19:38.851
Before the color,
no white man...

19:38.892 --> 19:42.692
no man of any hue
moved to civilize

19:42.729 --> 19:45.698
or improve a place like this had reason
to make the effort.

19:45.732 --> 19:48.166
The color brought
commerce here,

19:48.201 --> 19:52.001
and such order
as has been attained.

19:52.038 --> 19:53.903
Yes, sir.

19:53.940 --> 19:56.431
Do you want to help
Liberia, Odell?

19:56.476 --> 19:58.467
I want
to help myself.

19:58.512 --> 20:00.980
If Liberia is where
my chance is,

20:01.014 --> 20:03.482
it's all right
with me.

20:03.517 --> 20:05.348
Gold is
your chance.

20:05.385 --> 20:07.979
- Thank you, sir.
- Gold is every man's opportunity.

20:08.021 --> 20:10.080
Why do I make
that argument?

20:10.123 --> 20:13.854
Because every
defect in a man

20:13.894 --> 20:16.124
and in others'
way of taking him,

20:16.162 --> 20:18.687
our agreement
that gold has value

20:18.732 --> 20:21.963
gives us power
to rise above.

20:22.002 --> 20:23.663
Fond as you are
of my mother,

20:23.703 --> 20:25.398
without that gold
I showed you,

20:25.438 --> 20:27.372
I don't expect we'd
be out here talking.

20:27.407 --> 20:29.204
That is correct.

20:29.242 --> 20:32.405
And, for your effrontery at our meal
a moment ago...

20:34.047 --> 20:37.744
I'd have seen you shot or hanged
without a second thought.

20:39.352 --> 20:42.014
The value
I gave the gold

20:42.055 --> 20:44.114
restrained me,
you see...

20:45.559 --> 20:48.392
your utility
in connection to it.

20:48.428 --> 20:51.488
And because of my gold,
those at the other tables

20:51.531 --> 20:53.590
deferred
to my restraint.

20:55.335 --> 20:57.565
Gold confers power.

20:57.604 --> 21:00.300
Power comes to any man
who has the color.

21:00.407 --> 21:02.398
Even if
he's black?

21:04.911 --> 21:07.243
That is our
species' hope:

21:07.280 --> 21:10.408
that uniformly agreeing
on its value,

21:10.450 --> 21:13.248
we organize to seek
the color.

21:18.658 --> 21:20.649
Just before
you and I met, Odell,

21:20.694 --> 21:24.653
the camp's sheriff
released me from a jail cell.

21:24.698 --> 21:29.567
- That's hard for me to feature.
- I hate these places, Odell,

21:29.603 --> 21:31.935
because the truth
that I know,

21:31.972 --> 21:34.202
the promise
that I bring,

21:34.240 --> 21:37.403
the necessities I'm prepared to accept
make me outcast.

21:45.986 --> 21:47.977
Isn't that foolish?

21:49.756 --> 21:51.815
Isn't that foolishness?

21:54.227 --> 21:56.923
An old man
disabused long ago

21:56.963 --> 21:59.989
of certain yearnings
and hopes

22:00.100 --> 22:02.967
as to how he would be held
by his fellows,

22:03.002 --> 22:05.905
and yet I weep.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.644
Anyway, sir,

22:11.678 --> 22:13.509
you want to send
someone back with me?

22:13.546 --> 22:15.377
Yes, I do.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.483
Yes, I do, son.

22:18.518 --> 22:21.646
I want to send you
to help your people...

22:23.990 --> 22:26.857
and take this place down
like Gomorrah.

22:31.164 --> 22:32.995
All being affected,

22:33.033 --> 22:36.400
we might consider
some facts as a group.

22:36.436 --> 22:39.735
I arrested Hearst, acting in the name
of the camp.

22:39.773 --> 22:42.298
Without the camp's
previous fucking say-so.

22:42.342 --> 22:44.503
Do you propose that?

22:44.544 --> 22:47.206
Getting a say-so
before I do my duty?

22:50.750 --> 22:54.242
Might be a good open...
showing Hearst it's off of him.

22:54.287 --> 22:56.721
Bullock's tin won't
placate Hearst.

22:56.756 --> 22:58.951
Give it the fuck
back to him.

23:01.628 --> 23:03.493
Add to your statement
or shut the fuck up.

23:03.530 --> 23:05.623
I'm done.

23:05.665 --> 23:08.463
Shall I, as Mayor,
initiate proceedings

23:08.501 --> 23:10.628
by giving
my own opinions,

23:10.670 --> 23:13.298
however titular

23:13.339 --> 23:15.739
and insubstantial

23:15.775 --> 23:18.573
and merely honorific
the position?

23:19.946 --> 23:22.676
Which argues
against my doing so.

23:23.683 --> 23:25.981
How is Hearst
likely to answer?

23:26.019 --> 23:28.749
Ought steps to be taken
in preemption?

23:28.788 --> 23:31.723
My instinct's
to act alone,

23:31.758 --> 23:33.817
chart the course
for fucking carnage.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.192
That this
would be general

23:36.229 --> 23:38.697
among 'em whose parents were so dim
as to bring them...

23:38.732 --> 23:42.725
the fucking innocence is
what gives me fucking pause.

23:44.571 --> 23:47.665
I invite the suggestions
of others

23:47.707 --> 23:50.608
against my instinct
to send for the guns.

23:56.616 --> 23:59.813
As I've expressed
to the sheriff

23:59.919 --> 24:02.620
and Mr. Star,

24:02.655 --> 24:04.987
and siding
with your instincts,

24:05.024 --> 24:08.653
to protect the innocents,
I'd send them from the camp.

24:08.695 --> 24:11.994
Then fall on Hearst
and his in their lair

24:12.031 --> 24:15.797
before they fall
on us in ours.

24:22.575 --> 24:25.874
As Wild Bill
would have done.

24:52.405 --> 24:55.135
This is
a letter.

24:55.175 --> 24:57.370
Who's the fucking letter to?

24:57.410 --> 25:00.106
What the fuck
is going on?

25:00.213 --> 25:02.704
- Last of those Cornishmen murdered.
- Pasco.

25:02.739 --> 25:05.344
- His family.
- Read the letter.

25:09.622 --> 25:13.524
"It becomes my painful duty
to inform you that Pasco Carwen

25:13.560 --> 25:16.654
- was killed earlier this week."
- Stop poking your head out.

25:16.696 --> 25:19.665
I'm seeing who's using
the cinnamon,

25:19.699 --> 25:22.566
and Harry Manning's
using it plenty.

25:22.602 --> 25:25.469
"...was not mutilated
in any way.

25:25.505 --> 25:28.099
His death seems
to have been instantaneous

25:28.141 --> 25:30.268
as he was stabbed
through the heart.

25:30.310 --> 25:33.507
Pasco's funeral
occurred today

25:33.546 --> 25:36.208
and was attended
by coworkers and friends

25:36.249 --> 25:39.218
who all shared the same
high opinion of him.

25:39.252 --> 25:41.777
Everything was done
by kind hands

25:41.821 --> 25:44.312
that was possible
under the circumstances,

25:44.357 --> 25:47.656
and a Christian burial
was given him.

25:47.694 --> 25:51.186
I was not personally
acquainted with Mr. Carwen,

25:51.231 --> 25:54.667
save for one encounter
where he demonstrated grief

25:54.701 --> 25:57.568
and deep compassion
at the passing of a friend.

25:57.604 --> 26:01.062
I knew him by reputation
as an earnest worker

26:01.174 --> 26:05.634
and a diligent believer
in right and wrong.

26:05.669 --> 26:08.240
His memory I am sure
will always be

26:08.281 --> 26:10.749
with those
who knew and loved him,

26:10.783 --> 26:14.549
among whose number
I imagine you as first.

26:14.587 --> 26:18.387
A letter from you
which I found in his tent

26:18.424 --> 26:22.087
causes me to convey
this sad intelligence to you.

26:22.128 --> 26:25.825
Sincerely yours,
Seth Bullock."

26:30.069 --> 26:32.367
What shall I do
with this, Mr. Bullock?

26:35.275 --> 26:37.766
What's your fucking
paper for?

26:37.810 --> 26:39.835
You fucking publish
as witness,

26:39.879 --> 26:42.609
for Hearst
and others to read.

26:45.752 --> 26:48.118
That's a very nice
fucking letter.

27:00.133 --> 27:02.226
Mr. Blazanov,

27:02.268 --> 27:05.396
had you much traffic tonight
on your apparatus?

27:05.438 --> 27:08.066
Some traffic, yes.

27:08.107 --> 27:11.440
I hope your important meeting
had a good result.

27:11.477 --> 27:13.570
As free men

27:13.613 --> 27:15.672
facing important
challenges,

27:15.715 --> 27:18.809
we choose
to be optimistic.

27:21.154 --> 27:23.088
Sir, I ask you

27:23.122 --> 27:25.613
take me
to Mr. Swearengen's place.

27:25.658 --> 27:28.684
Well, I... I will,
of course, Mr. Blazanov,

27:28.728 --> 27:31.663
though no activity
you may contemplate,

27:31.698 --> 27:35.099
for example, the making of friends
with his female employees,

27:35.134 --> 27:37.796
requires Mr. Swearengen's
personal approval.

27:37.837 --> 27:41.671
I wish to see him
for another purpose.

27:43.776 --> 27:46.210
All right.

27:47.747 --> 27:49.840
Shall we go now?

27:49.882 --> 27:51.816
Certainly.

27:57.590 --> 27:59.581
Mmm.

28:03.396 --> 28:04.761
Come on.

28:08.167 --> 28:09.896
Lovely letter,
wasn't it?

28:09.936 --> 28:11.801
Didn't you...

28:11.838 --> 28:14.170
come back sick from one
of them meetings?

28:14.207 --> 28:16.767
Last year,
from the peaches.

28:16.809 --> 28:19.141
Which is why I refrained
this time around.

28:19.178 --> 28:22.045
Far as
the fire wagon,

28:22.081 --> 28:24.049
I gather you felt
as I did,

28:24.083 --> 28:25.846
the moment was wrong
to broach it.

28:25.885 --> 28:27.750
My... my throat

28:27.787 --> 28:30.381
is all
fucking tight.

28:32.358 --> 28:34.826
Where did you lay
your hands on liquor, Harry?

28:34.861 --> 28:37.227
Harry?

28:37.263 --> 28:39.823
Help! Harry?

28:40.900 --> 28:43.198
Harry! Help!

28:43.302 --> 28:45.503
Oh.

28:45.538 --> 28:47.938
Look, Jack.

28:47.974 --> 28:50.499
White lumps on my tongue.

28:50.543 --> 28:52.374
Reel it in,
for God's sake.

28:52.412 --> 28:54.039
I'm so sorry.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.446
It's close, Jack.

28:56.482 --> 28:58.712
It's very close.

28:58.818 --> 29:01.048
I feel it's...
it's at breath.

29:01.087 --> 29:04.079
I hear it whispering
in my ear.

29:04.123 --> 29:06.091
"Forget your name.

29:06.125 --> 29:08.650
We go to black."

29:10.897 --> 29:13.058
The downstairs buffet
is quite passable.

29:17.870 --> 29:19.531
Oh.

29:19.572 --> 29:21.597
As like to kill you
as take passage

29:21.641 --> 29:23.609
with you to Liberia,

29:23.643 --> 29:25.975
his man you meeting
in New York.

29:26.012 --> 29:28.105
If Mr. Hearst
wanted me killed, Mama,

29:28.147 --> 29:30.672
- he could see it done here.
- Don't you ever believe

29:30.716 --> 29:32.581
you know what'd
please that man,

29:32.618 --> 29:34.711
or salt him
to come after you.

29:36.489 --> 29:39.322
And you look a fool
holding that cigar!

29:40.927 --> 29:43.088
I've played one
for smaller stakes.

29:44.163 --> 29:45.960
And the gold
ain't playing.

29:45.998 --> 29:47.625
I ain't trying
to steal nothing.

29:47.667 --> 29:48.964
I'll work my way
up the hog.

29:49.001 --> 29:51.799
And ain't you sent me out there
so I can turn out a man?

29:51.838 --> 29:55.740
I sent you so the hell that was coming
here for niggers wouldn't burn you up.

29:55.775 --> 29:57.640
There's plenty
of fire in Liberia.

29:57.677 --> 30:00.475
I can't undo
what I done, Odell,

30:00.513 --> 30:02.481
any more than you can,
searching out hurt.

30:02.515 --> 30:04.506
I ain't searching
no hurt out.

30:04.550 --> 30:07.815
We all get our portion.
We don't need to draw it to us.

30:07.854 --> 30:10.755
You hear me, Mama?
I ain't searching no goddamn hurt out.

30:10.790 --> 30:13.315
I done told you to mind
who you talking to.

30:13.359 --> 30:16.988
All right, Mama.
No bad language.

30:17.029 --> 30:20.430
If you'd kept me
to raise me, maybe I'd know.

30:27.940 --> 30:30.807
He got $742 for you,

30:30.843 --> 30:32.811
the little nigger
at the livery.

30:32.845 --> 30:35.211
And this brooch here too,
you can take.

30:35.248 --> 30:37.239
I can't find it.

30:37.283 --> 30:39.274
I can't
find it.

30:39.318 --> 30:41.309
Lord Jesus,
forgive me!

30:42.355 --> 30:44.823
When I read you had
stayed in the Comstock,

30:44.857 --> 30:47.052
I tried to come
here quick,

30:47.093 --> 30:49.789
be gone before he
sent for you to come.

30:49.829 --> 30:52.229
I ain't come here
to hurt you.

30:52.265 --> 30:55.063
I never said
you come to do me hurt.

30:55.101 --> 30:58.537
So's you wouldn't
have to see me.

30:58.638 --> 31:01.766
I prayed to see you
every day you was gone.

31:01.801 --> 31:05.404
My God, Odell,
what's wrong with you?

31:05.444 --> 31:08.242
No joy to seeing
my boy!

31:11.017 --> 31:14.817
- I'm sorry, son.
- Hush, Mama. Hush. Hush.

31:14.854 --> 31:17.914
Oh, do what you
think you got to.

31:17.957 --> 31:20.790
I couldn't find
the right.

31:20.826 --> 31:23.659
Hush now, Mama.
Hush.

31:23.696 --> 31:25.323
Oh!

31:25.364 --> 31:27.730
I got you now.

31:27.767 --> 31:30.235
"Bricks."
You see there?

31:30.269 --> 31:32.066
Yes, I see.

31:32.104 --> 31:35.733
"Bricks.
25 bricks. Stop.

31:35.775 --> 31:38.073
Addition to initial
order. Stop.

31:38.110 --> 31:40.271
First means
of delivery. Stop."

31:40.313 --> 31:42.781
And, Blazanov?

31:42.815 --> 31:44.806
Do you believe,
Mr. Swearengen,

31:44.850 --> 31:48.251
Mr. Hearst orders
more bricks?

31:48.287 --> 31:49.914
No.

31:49.956 --> 31:51.856
What do
you believe?

31:52.792 --> 31:55.852
I believe he orders
more humans.

31:55.895 --> 31:58.921
- Reinforcements.
- To do harm!

31:59.031 --> 32:01.192
As we saw
on our walk.

32:01.234 --> 32:04.761
Leave to die in a country
strange to them,

32:04.804 --> 32:07.967
men apart
from their families,

32:08.007 --> 32:10.737
working to give
them support.

32:12.712 --> 32:16.307
Fuck confidentiality
of communications.

32:16.349 --> 32:19.910
- Why not fuck a woman instead?
- I hope so eventually.

32:19.952 --> 32:22.182
Now I deliver
under seal

32:22.221 --> 32:24.416
his message
to Mr. Hearst.

32:24.457 --> 32:27.392
I'll dispose
of this, Blazanov.

32:35.101 --> 32:37.433
How are you occupying
yourself, Richardson?

32:37.470 --> 32:40.496
I'm praying
the meeting went well.

32:40.539 --> 32:42.598
Very touching.

32:42.642 --> 32:45.907
Now clear your mind
of the meeting

32:45.945 --> 32:49.005
and account for
the Negro with Hearst.

32:50.016 --> 32:51.813
They're both
in her room.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.647
Despite your best efforts,
Richardson,

32:56.689 --> 32:58.953
an answer
of some ambiguity.

33:01.027 --> 33:02.790
Is she with them?

33:02.828 --> 33:05.456
- One.
- One what?

33:05.498 --> 33:07.489
Of them.
Is with her.

33:07.533 --> 33:10.024
- Who?
- Aunt Lou.

33:10.069 --> 33:12.765
- Who is with Aunt Lou?
- Her son.

33:14.206 --> 33:15.867
And where is Hearst?

33:15.908 --> 33:18.206
His room.

33:19.478 --> 33:21.708
Then I will
retire to mine.

33:21.747 --> 33:23.738
Well, how was
the meeting?

33:28.888 --> 33:32.255
I imagine the pool
that spawned you.

33:32.291 --> 33:34.452
I am filling it
with rocks.

33:34.493 --> 33:37.951
I am holding shut
your gills

33:37.997 --> 33:40.022
to prevent you
from taking in air.

33:44.470 --> 33:47.234
I suppose the meeting
went quite well.

33:55.614 --> 33:58.549
I itch.

33:58.651 --> 34:00.050
- Dust.
- No matter how much

34:00.086 --> 34:03.852
regularity of cleaning or consideration
for the children,

34:03.889 --> 34:05.857
a place like this
is filled with dust.

34:10.862 --> 34:12.728
He's dead.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.527
Chesterton is
with us still,

34:14.567 --> 34:17.434
though to bring him in the evening chill
would be imprudent.

34:17.469 --> 34:19.802
We'll bring him
tomorrow

34:19.839 --> 34:22.569
when this room
is less cold.

34:22.608 --> 34:25.907
After the children have gone and before
you bring him,

34:25.945 --> 34:27.879
I will give the place
a good dust.

34:27.913 --> 34:29.608
Then the carpentry
will begin.

34:29.648 --> 34:31.547
You've engaged
the carpenters?

34:31.583 --> 34:33.779
Yes.

34:33.819 --> 34:36.014
He is close to the end,
isn't he?

34:36.054 --> 34:38.784
Yes, Bellegarde!

34:38.824 --> 34:40.724
For Christ's sake!

35:02.348 --> 35:04.578
Haunted.

35:04.617 --> 35:07.484
Drafts from all over.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.750
From the walls,
from the side,

35:09.789 --> 35:12.189
swooping down
from the ceiling.

35:12.224 --> 35:15.318
I will dust anyway
for Chesterton,

35:15.361 --> 35:20.128
even though after,
the carpenters come.

35:20.166 --> 35:22.066
Uh, the attitude
on people leaving

35:22.101 --> 35:25.298
definitely stepped forward
from the attitude they wore coming in.

35:25.337 --> 35:27.601
I mean, no one's trying
to quarrel about that.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.871
Then what's your quarrel?

35:30.910 --> 35:33.879
I'm asking
what was decided.

35:35.114 --> 35:38.345
They're publishing
the letter as witness.

35:38.384 --> 35:41.751
- Witness?
- A witness in the sense that...

35:41.787 --> 35:45.917
Witness the letter...
its content.

35:45.958 --> 35:48.654
Yeah, the letter's
contents is witness

35:48.694 --> 35:50.321
that...

35:50.362 --> 35:53.229
Bullock wrote
a nice fucking letter.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.258
And it proves...

35:58.370 --> 36:00.497
that that's the sort
we are here,

36:00.539 --> 36:03.440
the caring sort that
would write a letter of that ilk.

36:03.476 --> 36:07.105
Furthermore, we don't
give a fuck who knows it,

36:07.146 --> 36:09.205
George fucking Hearst
included.

36:09.248 --> 36:10.909
Fucking Hearst
especially.

36:11.984 --> 36:13.542
Is the witness?

36:13.586 --> 36:16.146
Better late than
fucking never, Johnny.

36:19.492 --> 36:23.189
Hey! Little Miss
Fucking Cinnamon.

36:56.362 --> 36:59.354
I wanna be good.

37:00.633 --> 37:03.227
I wanna be good.

37:18.517 --> 37:20.610
Good evening.

37:24.056 --> 37:25.614
Good evening.

37:31.730 --> 37:33.527
For being gone, I...

37:33.566 --> 37:35.557
I notice
I'm frequently back.

37:37.503 --> 37:40.063
I come to kiss her
good night.

37:40.105 --> 37:43.040
I tried to persuade her
you'd done so last night.

37:43.075 --> 37:44.633
My beard always
wakes her.

37:44.677 --> 37:47.737
She said so,
refuting me.

37:52.851 --> 37:54.819
The thing I did

37:54.853 --> 37:56.718
that made you leave
last night,

37:56.755 --> 38:01.021
the thing I was coming home
to do again...

38:02.161 --> 38:04.925
I pray now
to forego forever.

38:04.964 --> 38:08.092
Not having me in this house is gonna
improve your odds.

38:08.133 --> 38:11.830
I started using spirits
at 17, Ellsworth,

38:11.870 --> 38:14.100
with no premonition
we'd marry.

38:14.139 --> 38:16.903
Well, my feeling's
that being vessel

38:16.942 --> 38:20.503
of purposes not your own,
your eye was out for relief.

38:20.546 --> 38:22.514
But glimpsing since

38:22.548 --> 38:25.676
how being your own vessel
is preferable,

38:25.718 --> 38:28.778
let the pressure
come off

38:28.821 --> 38:31.051
and you're liable
to do all right.

38:32.725 --> 38:35.956
You are no pressure.

38:35.995 --> 38:38.293
My...

38:38.330 --> 38:40.855
friendly hands'll

38:40.899 --> 38:43.299
always be out
to both of you.

38:50.042 --> 38:53.808
May I interrupt
her sleep with this beard?

38:55.781 --> 38:58.750
She'd be so glad
if you did.

39:15.300 --> 39:19.066
- Yes?
- Cheyenne and Black Hills Telegraph.

39:19.104 --> 39:21.072
Yes, all right.

39:33.752 --> 39:36.243
- Evening.
- Telegram for Mr. Hearst.

39:36.288 --> 39:38.256
Ah, thank you.

39:38.290 --> 39:41.521
I wonder if you might remain
just a moment while I read it,

39:41.560 --> 39:43.687
on the chance
I'll want to answer.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.720
Of course.

39:47.166 --> 39:50.101
- "Additional shipment of bricks."
- Yes, sir.

39:50.135 --> 39:53.366
Yeah, this is fine.
This is fine.

39:55.207 --> 39:59.439
- There'll be no answer.
- This is $20, sir.

39:59.478 --> 40:03.175
It's all right, son.
Thanks for doing your job well.

40:03.215 --> 40:06.116
You're most welcome.

40:10.089 --> 40:12.250
John Langrishe, Al.

40:12.291 --> 40:14.486
Come on, Jack.

40:16.562 --> 40:19.087
- Early finish below?
- We'd a meeting.

40:19.131 --> 40:20.894
I ought to have
asked you to.

40:20.933 --> 40:24.391
What topic commended
my presence?

40:24.436 --> 40:26.802
Reprobates?
The elderly?

40:26.839 --> 40:28.466
Fucking Hearst...

40:28.507 --> 40:30.702
that took an axe
to my left middle digit,

40:30.743 --> 40:34.201
sends for 25 more thugs
to take the tool

40:34.246 --> 40:37.147
to the whole
fucking camp.

40:37.182 --> 40:39.776
Why am I fucking
optimistic?

40:39.818 --> 40:43.310
Did your meeting find
a strategy in counterpoise?

40:43.355 --> 40:46.586
We heard the fucking
reading of a letter.

40:48.060 --> 40:50.585
- Ah.
- Writ by Bullock,

40:50.629 --> 40:54.156
to a miner's family after Hearst had
had him murdered.

40:54.199 --> 40:56.394
Exhorting they charge
Hearst with the crime?

40:56.435 --> 40:57.993
Never once
mentioning Hearst.

40:58.103 --> 41:00.537
Expressing sympathy
to the family,

41:00.572 --> 41:02.665
respect for the way
the man lived.

41:02.708 --> 41:06.644
We decided Merrick would
publish in the paper.

41:07.946 --> 41:11.177
Strategy some
may call ingenuous,

41:11.216 --> 41:13.844
others merely
off the point.

41:13.886 --> 41:18.323
I sit mystified
I was moved to endorse it.

41:19.324 --> 41:20.985
Mystified, Al,

41:21.026 --> 41:24.484
at proclaiming a law beyond law
to a man who's beyond law himself?

41:24.530 --> 41:28.296
Its publication
invoking a decency

41:28.333 --> 41:31.825
whose scrutiny applies to him
as to all his fellows.

41:31.870 --> 41:35.306
I call that strategy
cunningly sophisticated,

41:35.340 --> 41:40.300
befitting and becoming
the man who sits before me.

41:48.353 --> 41:50.378
Open the place
back up!

41:50.422 --> 41:52.947
Tell the whores if their legs
ain't in the air,

41:52.991 --> 41:55.516
they'd better be
off their asses!

41:59.765 --> 42:02.325
So what progress
in your affairs?

42:03.435 --> 42:06.336
Our opening is delayed.

42:06.371 --> 42:11.035
An old man is dying...
one of my actors.

42:11.076 --> 42:12.737
And...

42:13.946 --> 42:15.937
I'm sad.

42:24.289 --> 42:26.917
Oh...

42:26.959 --> 42:29.154
perhaps just the one.

42:33.298 --> 42:36.267
- In?
- Folded up on the boardwalk beside me

42:36.301 --> 42:39.828
- like a goddamned accordion.
- So you've remarked.

42:44.142 --> 42:46.770
I believe
I'll take my leave...

42:46.812 --> 42:49.508
You're wheezing bad as me, Doc.
Did you eat cinnamon too?

42:49.548 --> 42:52.745
...lest I distract
from the business at hand

42:52.784 --> 42:54.945
by requesting
a fucking drink!

42:54.987 --> 42:58.753
Have you adverse reactions to other food
or condiments, Harry?

42:58.857 --> 43:00.552
Eggplant shreds
the roof of my mouth

43:00.592 --> 43:02.321
if it's any of your
fucking business.

43:02.361 --> 43:05.524
Irritability at the bowel, we know
you suffer from.

43:05.564 --> 43:07.464
You're all right.

43:07.499 --> 43:10.400
Don't eat
cinnamon anymore.

43:10.435 --> 43:14.269
- Or eggplant?
- Not if it shreds your mouth.

43:19.845 --> 43:23.178
Hope you don't mind my absconding
with you from your cabin, Doc.

43:23.215 --> 43:24.876
- No.
- Campaigning any threat

43:24.917 --> 43:26.851
to Harry's health?

43:30.956 --> 43:33.481
- How was the meeting?
- Oh, it was all right.

43:33.525 --> 43:35.959
Um, needless to say,
we missed you.

43:54.579 --> 43:58.106
I am so glad your mother
isn't alive

43:58.216 --> 44:00.343
to see you
in this condition.

44:00.385 --> 44:03.115
Doc, get up here.

44:03.155 --> 44:05.589
Not tonight.

44:05.624 --> 44:07.455
Tonight.
Now.

44:10.062 --> 44:13.031
Leave your kit.
I'll have Johnny go get it.

44:13.065 --> 44:15.727
I'm not gonna leave
my fucking kit.

44:31.883 --> 44:34.044
I wonder what you think
you're fucking doing.

44:34.086 --> 44:36.646
I'm laying down before
I leave in the morning.

44:36.688 --> 44:39.384
I will ask
the questions here!

44:39.424 --> 44:41.756
This is my place.

44:41.793 --> 44:45.092
Do you think it's yours?
It is not.

44:45.130 --> 44:48.395
It is mine,
bought and paid for.

44:48.433 --> 44:52.392
And if I wanted to shit this instant
in the middle of this stable,

44:52.437 --> 44:56.100
no man, black or white,
could gainsay me!

44:56.141 --> 44:58.166
You've already
fucked a horse.

44:58.276 --> 45:00.836
Nor will I stoop

45:00.879 --> 45:04.246
to explaining the mistake
in that statement,

45:04.282 --> 45:06.944
to a nigger lemur

45:06.985 --> 45:10.148
or some other small
form of monkey.

45:13.692 --> 45:15.319
Where you going
in the morning?

45:15.360 --> 45:18.727
West...
San Francisco.

45:18.764 --> 45:22.757
I'm hoping that chestnut's owner
might go with me.

45:22.801 --> 45:25.998
The demon nigger
that appeared at the bar.

45:26.038 --> 45:27.699
The very same.

45:33.478 --> 45:36.777
I don't suppose...

45:36.815 --> 45:39.010
knowing I'd be vigilant

45:39.051 --> 45:43.112
against theft
and intolerant to tardiness...

45:43.155 --> 45:45.589
you'd be inclined
to stay on and work here.

45:47.592 --> 45:49.116
No.

45:50.195 --> 45:52.823
Nor would I want
to fucking have you!

45:53.999 --> 45:56.991
And do not come and try
to murder me as I sleep!

45:58.937 --> 46:00.802
And...

46:00.839 --> 46:02.898
I will not come

46:02.941 --> 46:05.000
and try to murder you.

46:12.784 --> 46:16.185
Black fucking bastard.

46:19.357 --> 46:22.292
What did you want?

46:22.327 --> 46:25.854
- Fucking sick, I'm told.
- I have a chest cold.

46:25.897 --> 46:27.865
You're a lunger.

46:37.576 --> 46:39.305
Fucking samples, Doc.

46:39.344 --> 46:41.369
Notions
from that tailor

46:41.413 --> 46:44.541
as to how
we cover my stump.

46:44.583 --> 46:47.609
I've believed for
the last dozen years

46:47.652 --> 46:49.847
that disease
is airborne,

46:49.888 --> 46:52.914
and I won't make
others sick.

46:52.958 --> 46:55.449
No one gets out
alive, Doc.

47:19.584 --> 47:21.677
Jesus Christ!

47:21.720 --> 47:24.154
The fucking gimp finds
something useful to do

47:24.189 --> 47:26.623
in the fucking brace
you made her!

47:26.658 --> 47:28.216
Do you think you could treat
being Johnny...

47:28.260 --> 47:30.660
always struggling
to fashion a thought?!

47:30.695 --> 47:33.323
Every fucking night

47:33.365 --> 47:36.493
I, that could cut a throat
but sleep the sleep of the just,

47:36.535 --> 47:38.867
spend six fucking wakings

47:38.904 --> 47:41.202
trying to find a piss pot
with my dribble,

47:41.239 --> 47:44.538
and wondering
when I got to be so old.

47:47.112 --> 47:49.580
Pick a fucking swatch
for a spit rag,

47:49.614 --> 47:52.549
use the others for masks,
and go about your fucking business!

47:52.584 --> 47:56.213
I ain't learning
a new doc's quirks!
