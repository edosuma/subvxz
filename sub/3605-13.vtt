00:01.377 --> 00:03.083
PETER: Previously on Heroes.

00:03.296 --> 00:04.502
SAMUEL: Claire.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.079
So glad you could make it.

00:07.592 --> 00:10.755
Whatever you're doing
right now,
please, just stop.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.211
This is much more dangerous
than you know.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.095
No matter what happens
in your world,

00:15.183 --> 00:17.014
you can always
come back to this one.

00:17.101 --> 00:19.092
Whenever you want.
I know.

00:21.814 --> 00:23.520
You killed Joseph,
didn't you?

00:23.608 --> 00:25.064
You betrayed us
to the government.

00:25.151 --> 00:27.733
And when Joseph
found out,
you killed him.

00:27.820 --> 00:28.855
You lying bastard.

00:29.155 --> 00:30.895
lwill tell you
how you die.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.196
You die alone.

00:32.283 --> 00:35.116
No one will mourn your death.
No one will shed a tear.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.700
I wish I can change fate,

00:36.787 --> 00:38.197
but you must
go on your path.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.912
Give me my brother back.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.532
Come on, Nathan.
I know you're in there.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.754
NATHAN: I don't think
I can hang on.

00:45.838 --> 00:46.873
Sure you can.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.629
Nathan.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.547
NATHAN: You need to accept
that I'm gone.

00:50.635 --> 00:54.219
You fight the good fight.
You've always been everything
that's good in the world.

00:54.305 --> 00:55.545
PETER: Nathan.

01:18.371 --> 01:20.077
lwanna see him.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.793
The plane's ready to go.

01:32.969 --> 01:37.053
I can handle this, Peter.
You don't have to
have any part in it.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.179
Yeah, I do.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.484
lt's awful.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.609
Did the police,
you know,
say anything?

02:00.371 --> 02:01.451
Engine fire or...

02:01.539 --> 02:03.825
Accident.
Tragic accident.

02:06.168 --> 02:09.251
I'm so sorry
for your loss.
Excuse me.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.507
(GASPING)

03:05.728 --> 03:08.265
I tried to stop him.
I'm sorry.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.766
Stop who?

03:10.441 --> 03:12.022
SYLAR: Hello, Samuel.

03:15.738 --> 03:16.944
Sylar.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.113
Oh, good.
You remembered.

03:19.450 --> 03:21.361
Get everyone to safety,

03:21.452 --> 03:23.317
but not too far.
Understand? Go.

03:33.798 --> 03:35.754
You're just delaying
the inevitable.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.502
You could've
killed Doyle.
You didn't.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.208
I'll get to him.

03:39.678 --> 03:41.930
I'm much more
interested in you.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.050
Memories were
a little fuzzy,

03:44.141 --> 03:46.052
like an orange
that's been
left out too long,

03:46.143 --> 03:48.759
but I could still
find my way back.

03:48.854 --> 03:49.843
Thank you.

03:49.939 --> 03:51.270
My pleasure.

03:52.650 --> 03:56.393
Been a while since
my body and mind
were together.

03:56.779 --> 03:58.064
It'd be a crisis
for a lesser man,

03:58.155 --> 04:01.238
having your soul
ripped out of you,
but not for me.

04:01.325 --> 04:07.491
I returned
with one simple,
singular thought.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.118
I know. Wait,
don't tell me. Fun?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.252
Feast

04:17.299 --> 04:20.006
Love what you've done
with the place.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.968
Brought a lot more
people in here.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.630
Gonna make me
a lot more powerful.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.851
No. It makes me
more powerful.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.302
I've got
big plans for you.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.429
Kill me now,
you'll never know
what could be.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.140
Everybody has
big plans for me.

04:36.986 --> 04:39.398
I think that's all
people have.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.001
(GRUNTING)

05:34.460 --> 05:36.041
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

05:48.724 --> 05:49.804
Hey.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.935
You all right?

05:52.603 --> 05:56.812
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.978
Thoughth
give you a lift.

06:02.947 --> 06:03.936
Oh.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.230
You don't want a ride?

06:12.289 --> 06:15.122
I'd actually prefer
if you didn't come.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.833
You lied to me,

06:18.587 --> 06:19.793
once again.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.626
About Nathan's death,
about what you did.

06:24.927 --> 06:25.916
God.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.678
It was Sylar.

06:31.684 --> 06:35.802
Did you forget
that it was Sylar?

06:36.146 --> 06:37.886
Did you forget
what he did to me?

06:37.982 --> 06:39.017
No.

06:39.108 --> 06:43.477
He attacked me.
He cut open my head.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.688
He killed my father,
and you...

06:48.325 --> 06:52.364
You dressed him up
in Nathan's face,
and I hugged him.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.290
And I felt love for him.

06:56.125 --> 06:59.663
We did the wrong thing
for the right reason.

07:00.296 --> 07:01.911
We found a way
to contain Sylar

07:02.006 --> 07:05.339
and to keep Nathan alive
at the same time. Claire.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.261
It didn't work.
We shouldn't have
doneit

07:08.345 --> 07:10.051
You did.

07:10.514 --> 07:14.177
And I need time to grieve
without being reminded why.

07:19.982 --> 07:21.472
(DOOR OPENING)

07:38.417 --> 07:41.500
I keep looking up, too,
hoping to see him.

07:43.172 --> 07:46.460
We never have been
very good with death,
have we?

07:46.550 --> 07:48.290
Or its complications.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.210
Can't have been
easyforyou,

07:51.305 --> 07:53.717
covering this all up
with Noah.

07:53.932 --> 07:54.967
How are you?

07:55.059 --> 07:57.220
Okay. I'm okay, Mom.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.721
Nathan was
a better liar.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.349
Must've gotten that
from you.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.811
I'm sorry.
You don't deserve that.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.439
Sure, I do.
I deserve every ounce
of your wrath.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.072
No, you don't.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.522
| just wanna put my fist
through a wall right now.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.529
No. You wanna
put a fist
through Sylar.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.615
What do you want, Mom?

08:17.706 --> 08:20.539
Don't do it.
Nathan was right.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.752
You need to fight
the good fight.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.669
Revenge will only
get you killed.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.418
And I cannot bear
to lose you, too.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.098
Claire's here.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.883
Hey.
Hey.

08:40.771 --> 08:42.853
You wanna help me
in the kitchen?

08:42.940 --> 08:44.020
You trying to escape?

08:44.108 --> 08:46.190
As quickly as possible.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.435
Hey, guys, why don't
you take a break?

08:50.781 --> 08:51.941
Thanks.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.495
Hey, where's your dad?
I didn't
see him out there.

09:02.418 --> 09:04.454
| asked him not to come.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.543
You pissed?

09:06.630 --> 09:07.961
You're not?

09:08.132 --> 09:09.372
Oh, lam.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.631
Good. 'Cause you're about
the only person who's
on the same page as me.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.216
It's a hell of a lie.

09:17.307 --> 09:18.638
They were trying
to protect us.

09:18.726 --> 09:21.468
Yeah, that's fine.
I get that.

09:22.479 --> 09:25.971
I mean, did they really
think that they were
gonna get away with it?

09:26.066 --> 09:28.398
Forever? That we would
just never find out?

09:28.485 --> 09:29.474
Owl

09:29.737 --> 09:31.477
Damn it.
Let me see.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.271
It's not healing.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.656
l have the Haitian's power.
l'll... Sorry,
I'll turn it off.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.612
No, don't. Don't.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.952
Let me find you
a Band-Aid.

09:47.463 --> 09:50.921
A Band-Aid.
l have not used
a Band-Aid in forever.

09:51.884 --> 09:55.468
It's nice to feel pain,
to feel normal.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.129
Or anything but normal.

10:01.977 --> 10:05.014
Mourning Nathan could
not be more ordinary.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.523
That's what
we're here to do.

10:09.818 --> 10:14.232
To cut lemons and limes
and remember

10:16.533 --> 10:18.239
that stupid jerk.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.531
I can't believe he's gone.

10:27.044 --> 10:30.912
Well, I hope he could
find heaven because
he was a terrible navigator.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.629
I mean, for a guy
who could fly.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.047
(CLAIRE CHUCKLING)

10:35.886 --> 10:38.548
Why are you laughing?
What's so funny?

10:38.680 --> 10:42.719
He gave me endless grief
for dating a guy
who could fly.

10:43.727 --> 10:47.219
He said I had daddy issues,
which I do.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.269
Whatever happened
to that kid?
What's his name?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.939
West. He goes at NYU.
We're Facebook friends.

10:57.866 --> 11:01.529
It's nice telling stories.
It makes it a little easier.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.404
What about you?
You must have
a million of them.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.915
I'll take these out there.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.026

MR. NOZAWA: Restaurant closed.
Everybody get out.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.087
Iron Maiden?
Seriously?

13:16.213 --> 13:20.331
Just a little nickname that
you earned back in the day.
It's a compliment.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.540
What're you
doing here, Noah?

13:21.635 --> 13:24.297
Aren't you supposed to
be at Nathan's wake?

13:24.388 --> 13:26.629
Claire didn't
want me to come.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.805
Do you have
the Sodium thiopental?

13:28.892 --> 13:30.007
You wanna
talk about this?

13:30.102 --> 13:32.263
There's just nothing
much to talk about.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.227
l misled her,
she's angry.
I don't blame her.

13:34.356 --> 13:35.812
Maybe if I'd followed
my gut on this,

13:35.899 --> 13:37.230
the whole thing
wouldn't have happened.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.439
So the truth serum's
for you?

13:38.527 --> 13:40.813
You're gonna confess
everything to Claire?

13:40.904 --> 13:42.360
Not exactly.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.064
Do you remember
the speedster
down in Miami?

13:45.200 --> 13:47.282
Carlos. The Cuban
Missile Crisis.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.030
We couldn't figure out
how to stop him.

13:49.121 --> 13:53.490
Well, it turns out that
speedsters don't like
the cold, or Quaaludes.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.039
But mostly the cold.

13:55.127 --> 13:59.962
Tightens their muscles,
slows down their heart,
levels the playing field.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.580
Meet Edgar.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.004
He's going to tell me
everything he knows
about the carnival.

Needle?

14:22.946 --> 14:23.935
(SlGHS)

14:24.031 --> 14:25.817
Why did you put
Sylar in my trailer?

14:25.907 --> 14:27.522
Because you're
going to help him.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.357
He's not...
Dead? No.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.284
He's amazingly resilient.

14:31.788 --> 14:34.370
Muscles knitting
back into flesh.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.912
But even though
all the parts are
back into place,

14:38.003 --> 14:39.334
there's something
wrong with him.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.456
VVeH,yeah”.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.003
No, not that.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.544
He had the chance
to end me
and he couldn't.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.626
He's different.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.754
Not the cold-blooded killer.
Not the blank slate.

14:50.849 --> 14:51.884
Then what?

14:51.975 --> 14:53.215
That's what
you're going to
find out,

14:53.310 --> 14:55.892
and how we can use that
to our advantage.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.140
How am I supposed
to do that?

14:58.231 --> 15:00.313
With your charming
personality.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.651
I'm not some piece of flesh
you can just toss around.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.980
You didn't seem to mind
the last time he was here.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.407
Don't be petulant.
lt's ugly.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.701
Everyone has to
do their share.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.031
I know the rules.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.904
If you had strength,
I'd put you
in construction.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.742
If you had the wisdom,
you'd teach the children.
Butno.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.873
These hands are meant
for a softer trade,

15:23.340 --> 15:27.174
plying out the demons
that haunt men's souls.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.711
Don't disappoint me.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.886
Your skin is so soft.
Just like a baby.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.563
What're you doing?

16:20.647 --> 16:23.263
I'm gonna help figure out
what's wrong with you.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.729
There's nothing
wrong with me.

16:27.904 --> 16:31.442
I heard differently.
You couldn't kill Samuel.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.284
Let's find out why.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.742
What're you afraid of?

16:51.803 --> 16:53.919
(BOTH MOANlNG)

17:11.865 --> 17:13.401
You're lonely.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.743
And you're afraid
you're gonna die alone.

17:15.827 --> 17:19.820
But you want love.
You just don't think
that you deserve it.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.995
Do you know what I do
to people like you?

17:29.799 --> 17:33.633
You cut open our heads,
you steal our powers.

17:38.308 --> 17:42.472
And you see
what people want.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.804
Their desires,

17:46.942 --> 17:48.603
their hopes.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.024
I like it.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.156
What're the tattoos for?

18:04.834 --> 18:05.960
A map.

to help me.

to your agenda
to kill Samuel.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.389
I got your power.

18:29.943 --> 18:33.777
I don't need to kill.
That's just something
I like to do.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.943
Not anymore.
You're impotent.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.637
I tried to find
a photo of you, but...

19:04.728 --> 19:06.434
There are none.

acknowledge you.

19:13.737 --> 19:15.853
But you convinced him
that it would tarnish
his career.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.608
I know.
I've heard the story.

19:17.699 --> 19:19.235
You're angry.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.575
I'm disappointed,

19:23.872 --> 19:25.487
in you and my dad.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.160

to my elders,

19:28.251 --> 19:31.209

that comes out of
either one of your mouths.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.753
Well, I can't
blame you, Claire.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.838
But you do have
a good head
on your shoulders.

Wow. That I actually
do believe.

He's empathetic
beyond his years.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.217
But now it's
his time to grieve

19:47.312 --> 19:51.271
and he has
absolutely no idea
how to go about it.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.644
He needs a shoulder
to lean on.

I'm afraid he will never
trust me again.

to you, Claire.

See, ljust
buried my brother.
He was murdered.

24:39.479 --> 24:42.767

I had to stage his death.

but I'm not.

like everything's normal.

It's far from that.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.944
Why are you
telling me this, man?

24:58.039 --> 25:01.156
Because I understand
where you're at right now.

that have hurt you.

that murdered my brother.

to be hopeful.

down though.

that's gonna solve
anything, is it?

What are you talking about?
Quit messing around.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.701

be here to be
your personal safety net.

this is a good ability
to hang on to.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.573
And even if you do,
then what?

27:02.663 --> 27:04.449

have time to think.

Lying to us.

then it's real.

Here, drink up.
You must be freezing.

28:16.279 --> 28:18.065
I thought the skirt
was the good cop.

28:18.155 --> 28:20.146
Oh, the skirt
is the good cop,
trust me.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.774
This is her idea,
the two of us talking.

28:22.952 --> 28:26.820
If it were up to me,
you'd be down
six fingers by now.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.705
I spotted you as I came out
of my daughter's dorm.

28:29.792 --> 28:34.411
I figure your top speed
is somewhere between
600, 700 miles an hour.

28:34.505 --> 28:35.540
More?

28:35.631 --> 28:40.466
You could've killed me
at any time. Flew past,
gutted me. Blink of an eye.

28:42.889 --> 28:44.800
But you want me alive.

28:49.312 --> 28:52.145
You need me for something.
What is it?

28:54.483 --> 28:57.646
You don't have a compass.
You can't get home.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.983
What're you doing out here?

29:06.829 --> 29:08.069
Exiled.

29:09.832 --> 29:10.867
What did you do?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.912
Found out that
Sammy killed
his brother, Joseph.

29:14.003 --> 29:16.119
He convinced the lot
it was my fault.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.171
And theyjust believed him
on his say so?

29:21.719 --> 29:23.425
What's he planning?

29:23.512 --> 29:25.503
What's he going to do
with them?
Is he recruiting more?

29:25.598 --> 29:29.216
I don't know.
Sammy's all about
saber-rattling.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.846
He ordered me
to kill Danko.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.516
To slice up your gut.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.139
Sorry about that.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.356
You don't seem
like a hitman to me.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.741
I'm a juggler.
Joseph taught me.

29:48.412 --> 29:51.700
Called it the most
useful skill a man needs.

29:52.375 --> 29:53.455
A juggler?

29:53.542 --> 29:56.875
You can keep
a chainsaw, knife,
and torch in the air,

29:57.213 --> 29:58.623
you can
balance anything.

29:58.714 --> 30:02.548
But you're all out of balance.
You're exiled, you're lost.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.176
Why did you attack me?

30:06.555 --> 30:07.886
Thought if I caught
a bogeyman,

30:08.015 --> 30:10.802
brought you back to Samuel,
he'd take me back.

30:10.893 --> 30:11.973
You'd go back to Samuel

30:12.061 --> 30:14.427
even after
he killed your friend
and blamed it on you?

30:14.522 --> 30:16.808
I'm afraid of
what he's gonna do
to my friends,

30:16.899 --> 30:19.515
where he's gonna
lead my family.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.726
That makes two of us.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.566
We could help
each other here, Edgar.

30:28.703 --> 30:31.445
Enemy of my enemy makes us

30:32.748 --> 30:34.488
less antagonistic.

30:35.793 --> 30:38.079
We could stop
Samuel together

30:39.213 --> 30:43.081
before he has a chance
to hurt the people
we love the most.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.139
You think that
tea's gone cold?

31:01.444 --> 31:03.105
Fresh out of ink.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.445
You destroyed
the last batch.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.106
Then make more.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.447
You want a tattoo?

31:13.289 --> 31:17.032
You want to find out
where you're supposed
to go next?

31:17.126 --> 31:19.287
I say you're
already here.

31:20.463 --> 31:21.498
I don't think so.

31:21.589 --> 31:23.625
I know why
you can't kill.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.791
Lydia told me
everything.

31:28.679 --> 31:31.056
I doubt she told
you everything.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.134
You think people
are lying,
manipulative bastards

31:37.229 --> 31:38.435
that're just trying
to con you.

31:38.522 --> 31:39.932
Aren't you?

31:41.859 --> 31:44.350
You're hurting.
You need a friend.

31:45.863 --> 31:47.069
Even though
I tried to kill you?

31:47.156 --> 31:49.238
Especially because
you tried to kill me.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.156
You're not special.
You're like
everyone else.

31:51.285 --> 31:53.822
We all need people
who understand us,

care for us.

32:03.506 --> 32:05.042
Who is she?

32:05.132 --> 32:06.338
Vanessa.

32:08.636 --> 32:10.467
The love of my life.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.808
l'd move
mountains for her
if she'd ask me.

32:16.018 --> 32:18.350
I haven't seen her
around here.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.178
No.

32:21.524 --> 32:23.060
She's out there.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.734
I'm afraid
she'll reject me

32:27.863 --> 32:29.945
for who I am,
for what I've done.

32:30.032 --> 32:33.399
That's the way you think, too.
That no one could love you.

32:33.494 --> 32:36.452
Stop pretending
like you know
who I am.

32:36.539 --> 32:38.200
You have no idea.

32:38.707 --> 32:43.576
I know Hiro Nakamura said
you're going to die alone,
and it's haunting you.

32:45.840 --> 32:47.205
I know you.

32:49.385 --> 32:50.841
lam you.

32:53.222 --> 32:57.215
I'm not a good guy,
but I'm not all bad either.

32:59.395 --> 33:04.059
I found love and forgiveness
and acceptance right here.
And you can, too.

33:06.777 --> 33:08.358
If that's true,

33:10.072 --> 33:13.439
let the tattoo show me
and I'll stay.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.326
What?

33:19.415 --> 33:21.701
You afraid I might
see something else?

33:22.293 --> 33:26.411
I'm a carnie.
I live for games of chance.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.595
You sure we should
have him up here?

miso soup before.
It's good. Thank you.

33:49.612 --> 33:51.443
No. Thank you, Edgar.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.947
This is invaluable.
Now we know
what we're up against.

33:55.451 --> 33:58.033
The problem,
of course,
is finding it.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.076
Claire has a compass.
No.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.199
I'm just saying.

34:01.290 --> 34:04.123
I'm not putting her
in the middle of this.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.501
You must have a way
to get back in.

34:07.588 --> 34:10.250
Lydia. She has
no great love
for Samuel.

34:10.341 --> 34:13.378
Good. Good. Okay.

34:13.469 --> 34:16.711
We're gonna isolate
Samuel here
in this backstage area,

34:16.805 --> 34:18.181
quick and targeted.

34:18.265 --> 34:20.756
And nobody else
gets hurt, right?

34:23.354 --> 34:24.639
ldeally.

34:24.772 --> 34:27.309
We're gonna do
everything we can,
but this is a raid.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.232
When it's over,
I promise you we will
take care of everybody.

34:30.319 --> 34:31.399
We'll find them all homes.

34:31.487 --> 34:32.727
They've got a home.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.403
The carnival's our home.
Samuel's the problem.

34:35.491 --> 34:36.947
If they're wrapped
around his finger,

34:37.034 --> 34:39.241
he's gonna use them
to protect himself.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.819
They're lambs.
They know no better.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.246
MR. BENNET:
He's brainwashed them, Edgar.
Look what he did to you.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.995
He turned you
from a juggler
into an assassin.

34:47.086 --> 34:48.496
Even if we stop Samuel,

34:48.629 --> 34:50.711
can you promise me
that somebody else won't
just take his place?

34:50.798 --> 34:52.538
LAUREN: I know that
you think of this
as a family,

34:52.633 --> 34:55.841
but it has a lot more
in common with a cult.

34:55.970 --> 34:57.426
Your friends need help.

34:57.513 --> 34:58.923
They need to be
left alone.

34:59.014 --> 35:02.256
Left alone
out in the open
makes them targets.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.592
l have never
seen that end well.

35:04.687 --> 35:08.271
But by separating them,
by reintegrating them
into the real world,

35:08.357 --> 35:11.599
we can make sure
that this doesn't
happen again.

35:14.947 --> 35:16.812
What are
you doing, Edgar?

35:16.907 --> 35:19.444
It was a mistake
coming here
trusting you.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.156
I won't let you
hurt my family.

35:23.247 --> 35:25.989
Okay, Edgar,
just slow down.

35:26.667 --> 35:27.827
You're not
a violent person.

35:27.918 --> 35:28.998
No.

35:30.421 --> 35:31.627
You are.

36:29.021 --> 36:30.056
What's it doing?

36:30.147 --> 36:32.012
Stop thinking.
Stop trying
to force it.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.893
Just let it happen.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.944
Well, isn't that
interesting?

36:45.621 --> 36:47.452
lguess
you were wrong.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.489
I don't belong here.

I like it
better up here
than down there.

37:11.313 --> 37:13.178

go back tonight?

37:13.273 --> 37:15.264
Yeah, I've got
school tomorrow.

37:16.485 --> 37:18.567
Unless you want me
to stay, which I can.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.110
No, I'm cool.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.687
Yeah?

37:21.782 --> 37:24.068
Yeah. I'm fine.

37:26.870 --> 37:29.247
Because I've got
to trust you.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.035
Can't have you
lying to me. Not you.

37:33.127 --> 37:35.334
I'll always be
honest with you.

37:36.380 --> 37:37.665

we needed to end this
and I blew it.

You're being
hard on yourself.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.113
I thought the expression
was "too hard on yourself."

38:12.207 --> 38:14.198
No, no.
I said it right.

I still think
it was the right move.
Yes.

Samuel has done
a number on Edgar.
