00:01.794 --> 00:03.963
Previously on 90210:
You're my girl.

00:04.003 --> 00:06.173
And I want everyone
to know that.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.758
Give me a call.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.093
SILVER:
Ade, I want
our friendship back.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.261
How do we make it better?

00:11.303 --> 00:13.848
Break up with him.
I can't.

00:13.889 --> 00:17.184
We've been friends for too long
to let a guy come in between us.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.352
Really?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.822
SILVER:
Tomorrow? Okay, thank you.

00:29.864 --> 00:30.823
Bye.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.033
I have my NYU alumni
interview tomorrow.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.702
What about your hair?

00:34.743 --> 00:35.661
What about my hair?

00:35.703 --> 00:37.204
Are you Christopher Smith?
I am.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.122
What did you think
of Black Swan?

00:39.164 --> 00:41.375
Hi, Christopher.
This is Erin Silver.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.376
Christopher, me again.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.418
Look, I just had a thought,

00:43.460 --> 00:44.461
and it's about Black Swan.

00:44.503 --> 00:47.088
Do you want the job or not?
Yeah.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.466
You're famous.

00:49.508 --> 00:50.509
I used to be.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.889
Getting old is a bitch, Annie.

00:55.931 --> 00:58.517
♪ ♪

01:00.435 --> 01:01.854
Are you okay there?

01:01.896 --> 01:03.522
Oh, yeah. It's
just my lucky thong.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.524
It's made of some
gnarly lace,

01:05.566 --> 01:06.775
and it is itchy.

01:06.817 --> 01:08.443
Okay, that's better.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.946
You have a lucky thong?
Yeah.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.573
Never mind.
That's your lucky thong.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.742
Why are you wearing
your lucky thong?
Because I need luck.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.953
I'm going to find out
any day whether I get
into C.U. or not.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.080
And I have to get in,
I just have to.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.332
I think you're
going to get in.
Really?

01:22.374 --> 01:23.417
Yeah. Your grades are up.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.877
You did that charity
calendar thing.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.837
What college
wouldn't want you?

01:26.879 --> 01:28.756
You're awesome.
Oh, thank you.

01:28.797 --> 01:31.174
Maybe I don't need my
lucky thong after all.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.342
Maybe not...

01:32.384 --> 01:33.719
Whoa, no!

01:33.761 --> 01:36.597
Please don't take off your
underwear in public, Naomi.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.849
Why? Do you want
to take 'em off?

01:38.891 --> 01:40.768
Later.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.651
Check it out.

01:49.693 --> 01:52.237
It's like we started
a new trend.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.282
I think geek is
the new chic.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.784
(laughing)

01:56.825 --> 01:59.286
Mm, mm, mmm!

01:59.327 --> 02:01.705
Have they done something
different with the
grilled cheese?

02:01.747 --> 02:04.541
It's like gouda met Buddha.
It's insanely delicious.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.210
Okay, girl really likes
her grilled cheese, huh?

02:07.252 --> 02:08.377
Are you mocking me?

02:08.419 --> 02:09.545
Try this.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.339
Uh, no thank you.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.591
SILVER:
Come on!

02:14.384 --> 02:16.136
Well, it's...
I'm good.

02:17.763 --> 02:18.889
Um, no.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.390
(growls)
Philistines.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.934
After my first week at NYU,

02:21.976 --> 02:24.311
I'm not speaking to a single one
of you ever again.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.730
Wait, did you get in?
Well, not officially,

02:26.772 --> 02:28.315
but I had the most
amazing interview

02:28.356 --> 02:30.025
and Christopher, the alumni guy
I met with,

02:30.067 --> 02:31.777
basically told me
that I was in.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.779
Wow, congrats.
That's awesome.
Yeah.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.948
So when do you find
out for sure?
Any day now.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.365
I called Christopher
a few times.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.076
He still hasn't
called me back yet.

02:39.118 --> 02:41.369
Wait. You called him?

02:41.411 --> 02:43.705
It's cool.
He gave me his number.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.415
Look, Navid,
you don't understand.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.084
It's fine, trust me.

02:47.126 --> 02:48.877
Try not to worry for once.

02:48.919 --> 02:50.295
I'm going to get
some dessert.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.254
Who wants ice cream?

02:51.296 --> 02:52.213
Anyone? My treat.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.340
Yeah.
I'm good.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.427
Okay, somebody
take away her coffee

02:57.469 --> 02:58.929
before she gets back.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.266
And here we go.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.267
Give me that baby.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.477
Hello.
I have got
this thing down.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.062
I'm telling you, I can
have this kid wiped

03:07.104 --> 03:08.271
and diapered in
under a minute.

03:08.313 --> 03:10.189
You know what, I should
enter a contest.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.942
Well, I think you're
pretty terrific.

03:11.984 --> 03:13.777
Well, tell me more.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.445
Oh, actually I was talking
to Jack.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.447
Oh, that stings.

03:17.489 --> 03:21.493
(chuckles)
Hey, I was thinking, uh,
if you're not busy tomorrow,

03:21.535 --> 03:23.787
maybe I could take you
out on a real date.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.832
Ooh, as in a restaurant
that doesn't have a
menu you color in?

03:26.874 --> 03:29.501
Well, maybe even
a wine list.
Wow.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.836
Crazy.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.060
Hey.

03:46.101 --> 03:47.644
Hey.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.980
How you doing?

03:50.022 --> 03:51.231
Hungry.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.273
Oh, good. Me, too.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.984
I was thinking
we could go to that

03:54.026 --> 03:55.903
new sushi place
on La Cienega.
It's kind of pricy,

03:55.944 --> 03:58.072
but I heard
it's supposed to be great.

03:58.113 --> 04:00.199
Sure. Sounds good to me.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.950
(phone ringing)

04:05.120 --> 04:06.163
(ding)

04:06.205 --> 04:07.414
Friend of yours?

04:07.455 --> 04:09.332
Oh, no, it's nobody.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.085
You can call him back.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.921
No, that's cool.
I'll just deal
with it later.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.255
Let's get some dinner, man.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.757
I'm telling you,
I'm starving.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.966
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.982
So I finished sorting through
all of those clothes.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.902
I made a Good Will pile,
and a sell-to-a-fancy-
vintage-store-

04:36.944 --> 04:39.780
for-a-lot-of-money,
and I made a pile of,

04:39.821 --> 04:41.907
you-can't-throw-these-away-
they're-such-treasures.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.200
Sounds good.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.286
So why are you

04:46.327 --> 04:48.914
staring at me like
a fish on a hook?

04:48.956 --> 04:51.959
Well, um...

04:52.000 --> 04:55.336
I wanted to talk to you about...

04:58.090 --> 05:01.760
whether you would like
some tea.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.845
Some tea?

05:03.887 --> 05:05.847
Okay, fine.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.348
Okay, great.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.558
Thank you.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.685
Uh, and, um...

05:10.727 --> 05:13.396
Are you planning on
killing yourself?

05:16.108 --> 05:17.525
What?

05:17.567 --> 05:20.612
I found some articles
about suicide

05:20.654 --> 05:22.906
under your desk blotter.
How dare you.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.867
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
Do that again

05:25.909 --> 05:28.078
and you're fired!

05:28.120 --> 05:29.537
Marla, please,
talk to me.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.040
Are you really thinking
about suicide?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.501
Why would you do that?

05:38.379 --> 05:41.508
I have Alzheimer's
disease, Annie.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.551
Oh.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.138
I'm really sorry.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.516
But you shouldn't
kill yourself.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.269
Well, thank you.
I'll keep that in mind.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.812
Marla, I'm serious.

05:53.854 --> 05:57.398
I-I know that it must be
hard to forget things.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.110
Things? Forget things?

06:00.152 --> 06:02.821
Isn't that what
Alzheimer's is?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.447
Five years ago,

06:04.489 --> 06:07.159
I did Blithe Spirit
on the West End.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.662
I played Madam Arcati,
a great role.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.665
It was opening night.
The place was packed.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.959
Hundreds of people
coming to see me.

06:16.001 --> 06:18.128
It was wonderful--

06:18.170 --> 06:19.880
till the middle
of the second act

06:19.921 --> 06:22.049
when my mind just went blank.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.968
It was like someone took
a chalkboard

06:25.010 --> 06:26.845
and wiped it with a sponge.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.681
And there was this
terrible long moment

06:29.723 --> 06:32.684
where I didn't know why
I was on the stage.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.603
Oh, must have been awful.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.314
It was.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.149
But it's only
the beginning.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.152
Alzheimer's is
a degenerative disease.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.197
First I couldn't
remember my lines.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.282
I forgot how to drive.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.492
What next will I forget?

06:49.534 --> 06:53.538
How to bathe myself?

06:53.580 --> 06:58.001
How to dress myself?
How to eat? How to breathe?

06:58.043 --> 07:01.504
Do you really blame me for
investigating the possibility

07:01.546 --> 07:04.883
of dying with integrity
while still being myself?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.801
Investigating?

07:06.843 --> 07:10.722
Oh, I'm just doing research,
Annie.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.515
And that's all
it was?

07:12.557 --> 07:14.517
Just research?

07:16.978 --> 07:19.189
Annie...

07:19.231 --> 07:20.899
Yes?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.402
Could I have that cup of tea?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.571
Okay. Sure.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.948
Of course.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.375
(knocking)

07:38.417 --> 07:41.711
Silver, hey, you home?

07:41.753 --> 07:43.088
(whistles)

07:43.130 --> 07:45.757
Hey, I called you
like four times.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.387
What's... what's going on?

07:52.555 --> 07:54.015
Silver?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.063
I didn't get in.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.982
Oh...

08:02.023 --> 08:04.192
Babe, I'm... I'm sorry.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.154
I worked so hard.

08:09.406 --> 08:14.119
That's it-- I'm done trying
so hard for things

08:14.161 --> 08:16.413
and working my ass off
and getting my hopes up,

08:16.455 --> 08:19.582
because it's pointless.
Hey, come on.

08:19.624 --> 08:20.667
Don't talk like that.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.002
It's... it's just one school.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.212
Just one school. My God,

08:24.254 --> 08:25.339
it's much... One school!

08:25.380 --> 08:27.966
Navid, it's the school
I wanted to go to!

08:28.008 --> 08:29.592
Are you going to gloat?

08:29.634 --> 08:30.510
What?

08:30.551 --> 08:31.761
I know that you
don't think

08:31.803 --> 08:32.804
I should have called
Christopher.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.806
Well, you were right, okay?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.390
You're always right,
Mr. Perfect.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.101
Are you happy now?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.523
Maybe we should turn on
the light, okay?

08:43.563 --> 08:44.774
No!

08:44.816 --> 08:48.236
I just want to sit
here in the dark.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.781
(sighs)

08:51.823 --> 08:55.369
Silver, I ju... I just, uh, I
have to ask you something, okay?

08:55.410 --> 08:57.871
And I'm-I'm just asking you.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.166
Have you taken medication?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.792
Oh, my God.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.794
Are you kidding
me, Navid?

09:04.836 --> 09:06.213
Why would you
go there, huh?!

09:06.254 --> 09:07.755
Why can't I just
be upset?!

09:07.797 --> 09:09.007
No, no, of course you can.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.717
It's just earlier
you were so up,

09:10.758 --> 09:12.802
and now you're so down,
and I'm worried...

09:12.844 --> 09:14.804
Oh, well, then it must be
because I'm mentally ill!

09:14.846 --> 09:16.848
Oh, it's not that. It's just...
I don't want to see you!

09:16.890 --> 09:17.849
I don't want to talk to you!

09:17.891 --> 09:19.226
Just get out!
Can you let me explain?

09:19.267 --> 09:21.269
Get out! Leave me alone!

09:22.729 --> 09:24.772
Get out!

09:57.013 --> 09:58.348
MARCO:
Man, you played great today.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.350
Thanks. It felt pretty good
to get back out there, you know.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.601
I'm glad.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.311
Could I get
an Arnold Palmer, please?

10:03.353 --> 10:04.854
Me, too.

10:04.896 --> 10:06.356
Coming right up.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.690
(grunts)

10:07.732 --> 10:09.609
Hey, you want to hit up
the ArcLight tonight?

10:09.650 --> 10:12.279
I was thinking we'd go
see that new 3D movie.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.322
What, not a fan of 3D?
Too scary for you?

10:14.364 --> 10:17.409
No, I'd love to.
I just can't. I've got
so much studying to do.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.327
Well, how about tomorrow night?

10:19.369 --> 10:22.080
You know, I can't do it
tomorrow night either.
I got a soccer game.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.999
Sorry, man.
That's all right.
Some other time.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.293
Here you
go, guys.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.919
Thank you.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.839
Fund-raising gala

10:31.881 --> 10:34.384
for the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.344
Not interested.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.430
(sighs)

10:38.472 --> 10:39.973
Groundbreaking ceremony

10:40.014 --> 10:42.058
for the Beverly Hills
Museum of Cinema.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.602
Forget it.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.897
Ribbon cutting for
the grand opening...

10:47.939 --> 10:50.150
I hate ribbon cutting.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.236
What?

10:53.278 --> 10:54.779
Those eyes of yours.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.406
You look like a Keane painting.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.493
Look, I know you
have this disease,

10:59.534 --> 11:01.411
and I know that it's
really, really hard

11:01.453 --> 11:03.746
and scary, but the
reason you have no life

11:03.788 --> 11:06.374
is because you're hiding.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.001
You need to
stop living

11:08.042 --> 11:11.045
like a hermit, and you need
to start saying yes.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.173
You want me to say yes to life?

11:13.214 --> 11:17.177
I really want you to say yes
to one of those invitations.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.393
Yes.

11:25.435 --> 11:26.478
Yes?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.104
Ha! Yes!

11:28.146 --> 11:29.397
See?

11:29.439 --> 11:30.815
Oh, and this
is great!

11:30.857 --> 11:32.691
Look, the Los Angeles
young film aficionados

11:32.733 --> 11:34.027
kindly request
your presence

11:34.068 --> 11:35.278
at a gala screening of

11:35.320 --> 11:37.905
a lovingly restored print
of Penny Foolish

11:37.947 --> 11:40.367
at the Griffith
Observatory!

11:40.408 --> 11:43.036
You have no idea how I hate
seeing myself on film.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.162
I'm not going.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.704
Well, I'm sorry,
but you promised.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.666
So you and me
are hitting the town.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.172
(gasping)

11:54.214 --> 11:55.173
I got the letter!

11:55.215 --> 11:56.466
Hey. Which...

11:56.508 --> 11:58.385
Oh, oh! CU!

11:58.426 --> 11:59.636
Yes, CU!
Oh, my God, I'm so nervous.

11:59.678 --> 12:00.679
I-I can't open it.

12:00.719 --> 12:02.347
You open it.
(chuckles)

12:02.389 --> 12:03.598
Okay, okay.
All right.

12:03.640 --> 12:04.849
Oh, my God, I can't.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.940
Oh, my God, slit my wrist
with that envelope!

12:12.982 --> 12:14.150
You got in.

12:14.192 --> 12:17.111
I... I got in?

12:17.153 --> 12:18.279
You got in.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.489
I got in!

12:19.531 --> 12:22.325
You got in!
You got in!
I got in!
I got in!

12:22.367 --> 12:23.535
I'm going to CU!

12:23.577 --> 12:24.827
You're going to CU!

12:24.869 --> 12:26.580
I can take off
my lucky thong!

12:26.621 --> 12:28.747
What? How many days you
been wearing that thing?

12:28.789 --> 12:29.666
(laughs)

12:29.708 --> 12:31.042
(laughs):
Oh.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.088
Oh...
I'm so proud of you.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.881
Mm... oh. Ooh.
What?

12:36.923 --> 12:40.552
Now we just have to figure out
where you're gonna go to school.

12:40.594 --> 12:44.013
Oh, well, actually, um, I didn't
want to steal your thunder,

12:44.055 --> 12:46.558
but I got my acceptance
letter to MIT this morning.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.268
What? That's amazing!

12:48.309 --> 12:50.061
Yeah. I'm
pretty psyched.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.606
The astrophysics department's
one of the best in the world.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.108
It's been one of my top
schools since I was a kid.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.401
Max, that's great.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.152
I'm so excited.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.404
Where is it?

13:01.155 --> 13:05.577
The... Massachusetts
Institute of Technology...

13:05.619 --> 13:07.245
is in Massachusetts.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.581
Near Boston.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.666
Oh.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.254
Oh, wow. I...

13:16.296 --> 13:17.422
What?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.257
That's a long distance.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.468
I guess we're gonna be
in a long-distance relationship.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.762
Yeah.

13:23.802 --> 13:26.139
What?

13:26.180 --> 13:29.517
Yeah, I mean, we can try.

13:31.102 --> 13:33.354
"We can try"? What, you don't
think we can do it?

13:33.396 --> 13:35.523
Look, I mean, yeah, the romantic
in me says, sure, yeah,

13:35.565 --> 13:37.567
we should, we should go for
a long-distance relationship.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.403
But the scientist in me
has to look at the data,

13:40.445 --> 13:41.946
and the fact is,
statistically speaking,

13:41.988 --> 13:43.197
couples our age

13:43.239 --> 13:45.325
don't often survive
long-distance relationships.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.034
Okay, okay, sure,
that's statistics,

13:47.076 --> 13:48.077
but we're different.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.162
We're trendsetters.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.997
I mean, come on,
geek is the new chic.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.500
Hey, I'm not saying
that I'm giving up.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.794
I mean, I'm
crazy about you.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.796
I just...

13:57.836 --> 13:59.922
I think we should make
the most of the time

13:59.964 --> 14:01.090
that we do
have together.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.301
Right now, you know?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.514
Yeah, o-- Yeah, okay.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.017
We'll make the most
of the time we have together.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.851
Yeah.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.316
(cell phone ringing)

14:22.028 --> 14:22.945
(phone beeps)

14:22.987 --> 14:24.322
(clears throat)
Hello.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.782
NAVID:
Hey, Dixon, it's Navid.

14:25.824 --> 14:26.866
I really need your help.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.493
What's going on?

14:28.535 --> 14:31.162
It's Silver; she hasn't been
acting like herself lately.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.247
And I'm worried, man.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.583
I'm really worried.

14:41.922 --> 14:42.965
(knocks)

14:43.007 --> 14:44.925
Hey, you have any babies
you need sitting on?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.093
Hey, you're early.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.679
Yeah, I didn't
want you worrying.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.139
I know you can be
quite the nervous Nellie.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.851
Uh, actually, I prefer the
term "conscientious father."

14:52.892 --> 14:55.436
Uh, speaking of which, all the
numbers you need are right here:

14:55.478 --> 14:57.188
the restaurant where
Deb and I are going,

14:57.230 --> 14:58.939
next-door neighbors,
Maria the nanny,

14:58.981 --> 15:01.442
Poison Control,
uh, 911...

15:01.484 --> 15:03.444
I think I know
the number of 911.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.904
I have my phone;
if you want to call

15:04.945 --> 15:05.946
at any point
and check on Jack,

15:05.988 --> 15:08.449
I'll let him gurgle into it.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.909
Actually,
even better.

15:09.950 --> 15:13.538
I just got this new tablet
and we can video chat.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.583
I use it all the time.
Here, check this out.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.625
Hello?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.085
Hey, Maria, uh, can we see Jack?

15:19.126 --> 15:20.545
We're just in
the other room actually.

15:20.587 --> 15:23.089
Ryan, please,
don't be mad at me.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.924
What's-- uh,
is Jack okay?

15:24.965 --> 15:26.551
Hello, Ryan.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.977
Jen, what the hell
are you doing here?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.313
I'm sorry,
sh-she's very insistent.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.899
Jen, you're here!

15:40.940 --> 15:42.776
I missed you so much.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.068
Oh, I've missed you.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.905
And I have missed
my baby boy.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.364
Jen, seriously, what
are you doing here?

15:48.406 --> 15:51.158
Well, it's nice to
see you, too, Ryan.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.914
Um, I don't know what to say.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.667
Well, I'm sorry to just
show up like this,

15:59.709 --> 16:02.462
but we need to talk.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.802
(laughs)

16:08.843 --> 16:11.345
So, what are you and Marco
doing tonight?

16:11.387 --> 16:13.264
Nothing. He's got
a soccer game.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.224
Yeah, how is it going
with the new boy toy?

16:15.266 --> 16:17.143
It's okay.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.312
What's wrong?

16:19.353 --> 16:21.355
Who said there was
anything wrong?

16:21.397 --> 16:22.649
She's gonna drag it out of you.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.818
You might as well
save some time and spill it.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.153
She's very wise.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.115
Marco's a great guy,
and I like him a lot.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.493
I just... just don't think
I can trust him.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.368
Why not?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.454
Well, there's a
lot of things.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.372
He never answers the phone
when we're together,

16:38.414 --> 16:40.416
and he's always making excuses
why we can't hang out.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.042
I just think
he's hiding something.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.252
Or someone.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.879
(laughs)

16:44.921 --> 16:46.589
Naomi, stop it.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.966
No, it's hilarious.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.133
NAOMI:
No, I'm sorry.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.677
It's just the irony.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.345
It's the delicious irony.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.722
I wish every guy who was
a player in high school

16:54.764 --> 16:55.932
could turn gay
in his senior year

16:55.974 --> 16:57.266
and get a taste
of his own medicine.

16:57.308 --> 16:59.059
The player getting played.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.728
Do you really think so?

17:00.770 --> 17:01.729
ANNIE:
Not necessarily.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.815
Please, I know
soccer players.

17:03.857 --> 17:04.816
Chasing each other around,

17:04.858 --> 17:06.358
grabbing and rubbing
up against each other

17:06.400 --> 17:07.359
every chance they get.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.361
And then one of them

17:08.402 --> 17:10.112
scores a goal,
and they have an excuse

17:10.154 --> 17:11.155
to rip off their shirts

17:11.196 --> 17:12.699
and leap into
each other's arms.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.867
Do not listen
to her.
Unless you want
to hear the truth.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.368
Naomi! Zip it, all right?

17:16.410 --> 17:17.871
Look, if you think
Marco's a good guy,

17:17.912 --> 17:19.246
then you just need to trust him

17:19.288 --> 17:21.415
until he gives you
a real reason not to.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.752
Yeah, I guess so.

17:24.794 --> 17:26.880
I think that you should go
to his game and surprise him.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.840
He'll love it.
Mm, doubt that.

17:28.882 --> 17:29.799
Zip.

17:29.841 --> 17:30.925
Go to the game.

17:33.135 --> 17:35.013
...the college there, everybody
wears all their stuff.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.806
You guys know where--
you're at Stanford.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.307
Hey.
Huh?

17:38.349 --> 17:39.559
Hey.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.810
I'll see you later.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.645
Cool. Bye.

17:42.687 --> 17:46.106
Would you like to go
to a screening with me tonight?

17:46.148 --> 17:48.359
Annie invited us to this movie
with her friend Marla in it.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.777
You know Marla, the old lady.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.070
Anyway, it's a '60s theme,

17:51.111 --> 17:52.739
and I was thinking
you could go

17:52.780 --> 17:54.824
all Don Draper-esque.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.075
Do you have a skinny tie?

17:56.116 --> 17:58.036
Sorry.
Oh, well,
we'll just get you one.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.038
No, I mean I can't go.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.205
I told Morris
and Alan

18:01.247 --> 18:02.582
I'd play Black Ops
with them tonight.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.833
What?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.585
I'm sorry, Naomi, they're
my buddies, you know?

18:05.626 --> 18:07.045
We won't be
together next year.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.463
Neither will we.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.174
Naomi...

18:12.216 --> 18:14.677
I-I don't get it.

18:14.719 --> 18:17.638
You said to try to make the most
of the time that we had,

18:17.680 --> 18:18.973
and that's what
I've been doing.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.683
But you're not
doing anything at all.

18:20.725 --> 18:21.601
You're not even trying.

18:21.642 --> 18:22.894
Look, we talked
about this.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.896
It's not like I
don't care, I just...

18:24.938 --> 18:27.065
It's just statistics.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.711
♪ ♪

18:57.428 --> 19:00.473
Well, this is fun.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.268
Yeah, I mean,
I'm-I'm psyched

19:04.310 --> 19:05.770
to see the movie.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.273
So, Marla, what's it about?

19:09.315 --> 19:10.942
About an hour and a half.

19:10.984 --> 19:14.988
It's-it's a thriller, right?

19:15.029 --> 19:16.781
Depends on
what thrills you, I guess.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.075
ANNIE:
Well, uh, the
online movie guide

19:19.117 --> 19:22.078
said that it's like
The Thomas Crown Affair

19:22.120 --> 19:23.788
meets Blow-Up.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.791
So, Naomi, how come
Max couldn't make it?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.626
Statistics.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.298
That's a really cool necklace.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.633
Thank you.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.427
I wore it to the Academy Awards
the year I was nominated.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.762
You were nominated for an Oscar?

19:39.804 --> 19:40.805
Yeah.

19:40.847 --> 19:41.973
Warren Beatty was my date.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.265
We had a good night.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.560
Not as much fun
as tonight though.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.646
Riding in a limo
with a bunch of teenagers

19:48.688 --> 19:52.733
who are bound to be my only
audience at this pitiful event.

19:54.443 --> 19:58.572
Well, looks like we're there.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.285
(crowd cheering)

20:13.087 --> 20:14.755
I'll be damned.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.215
Did you do all this?

20:16.256 --> 20:19.635
Oh, me? I don't know
this many people.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.444
Excuse me.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.988
You know what time
the game starts?

20:39.030 --> 20:41.074
There's no game tonight.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.201
You sure?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.452
Positive.

20:45.494 --> 20:46.746
Okay, thanks.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.961
Look, I just
want to be clear.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.421
I am not okay
with this.

20:55.462 --> 20:57.548
You can't just abandon
your son for five months

20:57.590 --> 21:00.593
and then show up one day
and think that's okay.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.636
I-I totally get that.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.848
And you have
every right to be mad.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.184
But I need you to know
that I've changed.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.685
Okay?

21:09.727 --> 21:10.853
I freaked out.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.605
I have spent
some time in therapy,

21:12.646 --> 21:14.107
and I have worked on myself.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.025
And I'm in a completely
different place now.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.777
Really?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.570
(sighs)

21:19.612 --> 21:21.948
Look, I'm not a natural at this.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.032
Well, nobody's a natural.

21:23.074 --> 21:24.951
Parenting is hard,
and it takes hard work.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.453
I know, and I'm not

21:27.494 --> 21:28.704
trying to
underestimate that at all.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.749
I just mean to say that
you are really good at it.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.667
(chuckles softly)

21:33.709 --> 21:37.046
I feel like a complete failure
next to you.

21:39.506 --> 21:43.136
Look, Jen, it's...

21:43.177 --> 21:44.720
Parenting is a skill, okay?

21:44.762 --> 21:45.930
You learn how to do it.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.266
I mean, I made a lot
of mistakes at first.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.600
Really?

21:49.642 --> 21:50.684
Yeah.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.937
I mean, the first time
I gave Jack a bath,

21:52.979 --> 21:54.313
I mean, the water was so hot,

21:54.354 --> 21:55.940
I nearly boiled him alive,
like a lobster.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.608
You didn't.
I did.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.945
It just... takes time

22:00.987 --> 22:02.738
and commitment.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.864
I know.

22:03.906 --> 22:05.532
And I'm ready now.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.076
I'm ready to commit.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.911
Give me another chance.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.747
I really want this
relationship to work.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.084
Jen, uh, hmm.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.961
That can't... happen.

22:17.003 --> 22:21.132
I'm, I'm actually in
a relationship now

22:21.174 --> 22:22.300
with Debbie.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.592
Debbie Wilson.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.720
Oh, my God.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.473
Well, I-I'm sorry. I don't...

22:29.515 --> 22:30.891
mean to laugh,

22:30.933 --> 22:32.768
but that's just too funny.

22:32.810 --> 22:33.853
You're dating the help?

22:33.894 --> 22:36.522
Well. Anyway,
I was talking

22:36.563 --> 22:38.107
about a relationship
with Jacques.

22:38.149 --> 22:39.733
My son.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.359
I want to be in his life.

22:41.401 --> 22:42.736
Not yours.

22:42.778 --> 22:46.199
No offense.

22:51.745 --> 22:54.748
DIXON (knocking):
Silver!

22:54.790 --> 22:56.667
You up, Silver? (knocking)

23:02.173 --> 23:04.258
Silver.
(groans)

23:05.425 --> 23:06.719
(sighs)

23:06.760 --> 23:08.054
Okay.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.181
Uh... huh.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.559
I heard about NYU.

23:13.600 --> 23:14.935
Come to cheer you up.

23:14.977 --> 23:18.022
Please just leave me alone.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.275
If you want somebody
to leave you alone,

23:21.317 --> 23:23.319
I think you need to
change the hiding place

23:23.361 --> 23:25.403
for your spare key.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.074
Look, I'm not leaving
until you come out,

23:28.115 --> 23:29.825
so you might as well talk to me.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.041
What?

23:37.083 --> 23:39.126
Uh...

23:39.168 --> 23:42.796
Huh. I think you need
a change of scenery.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.174
So, uh... come on. Let's go.

23:45.216 --> 23:47.051
I don't want
to go anywhere.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.888
When's the last time
you ate anything?

23:52.265 --> 23:53.391
Okay.

23:53.431 --> 23:57.186
Let's go, let's go
get something to eat.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.437
I'm not hungry, Dixon.

23:59.479 --> 24:00.689
I mean, that's cool.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.317
I mean...
I'm starving, so...

24:03.359 --> 24:05.403
you could just
watch me eat.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.366
Huh?

24:53.617 --> 24:55.995
(onscreen):
I shouldn't have
met you here.

24:56.036 --> 24:59.123
(on-screen):
Yeah? Well, you shouldn't
have met me anywhere.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.295
(speaking along with movie):
I'm crazy for you, Jack,

25:04.337 --> 25:07.047
but I guess you
know that already.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.716
MAN:
Oh, I know. You were crazy
for a long, long time.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.386
MARLA (speaking along):
Well... I'm here now.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.430
What are you going
to do with me?

25:15.389 --> 25:17.475
I'll think of something.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.823
(doorbell ringing)

25:35.701 --> 25:37.786
(sighs)

25:39.579 --> 25:40.873
Can I help you?

25:40.914 --> 25:42.833
Um...

25:42.875 --> 25:44.251
Y-Yeah, is Marco home?

25:44.293 --> 25:46.003
I'm sorry, Marco?

25:46.045 --> 25:48.130
Marco Salazar?

25:48.172 --> 25:51.675
Oh, Marco.
Lupe's son.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.802
I'm sorry, Lupe?

25:53.844 --> 25:55.095
She's our housekeeper.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.473
But she's already
gone home for the day.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.141
Is everything
all right?

26:06.940 --> 26:09.068
Jack...

27:04.664 --> 27:06.459
RYAN:
You can't just go to therapy

27:06.500 --> 27:09.002
for a few months and pretend
you're a different person.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.255
You know?
Well, if there's
one person

27:11.297 --> 27:13.757
I could see benefiting
from some therapy, it's Jen.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.342
Yeah, it's just,
I don't know,

27:15.384 --> 27:17.511
she had all these
excuses for her behavior.

27:17.553 --> 27:19.388
you know, like, uh,
"I was intimidated,"

27:19.430 --> 27:20.931
or, "it was my hormones."

27:20.973 --> 27:22.682
Oh, hey, don't dismiss
hormones. They are real,

27:22.724 --> 27:24.184
and they are powerful.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.520
Oh, and she's wearing
flats now, like, uh...

27:26.562 --> 27:28.564
that's supposed
to impress me.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.690
Flats? Really?
Wow.

27:30.732 --> 27:32.692
You're buying this?
I mean,

27:32.734 --> 27:34.487
you think she's changed?

27:34.528 --> 27:36.363
(sighs)
It's just she...

27:36.405 --> 27:38.115
What?

27:38.157 --> 27:41.868
She was really nasty
when I told her about us.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.496
What'd she say?

27:44.662 --> 27:46.499
Oh, come on. Tell me.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.750
She called you "the help."

27:49.751 --> 27:50.961
That sound like
a new Jen?

27:51.003 --> 27:52.338
She's called me a lot worse

27:52.379 --> 27:54.465
and to my face.
Look, the fact is,

27:54.507 --> 27:56.592
she's the only mom that
Jack has, so you should

27:56.634 --> 27:58.385
try to make it work with her.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.139
For his sake.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.142
MARCO:
There you go.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.311
Double pastrami,
napkins in the bag.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.575
Hey.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.369
Hey.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.829
So I went by your house tonight.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.666
Turns out it
wasn't your house.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.168
Why'd you lie to me?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.462
I don't know.

28:33.504 --> 28:37.090
Look, I've been through
a lot this last year,

28:37.132 --> 28:40.302
and... I'm just not up for
being with someone who lies.

28:43.681 --> 28:45.974
Wait-- Teddy!
Wait! Wait.

28:46.016 --> 28:47.934
Come on! Wait.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.604
Please.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.690
Look.

28:54.191 --> 28:56.610
The truth is,
I live in East L.A.

28:56.652 --> 28:58.028
All right? My mom's
a housekeeper,

28:58.070 --> 28:59.321
my dad's on disability.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.531
I go to Malibu Country Day

29:00.573 --> 29:02.157
on a partial
athletic scholarship,

29:02.199 --> 29:04.410
and... the rest I pay
for by working here

29:04.451 --> 29:05.869
and a few other places.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.539
Okay. Well, why couldn't you
tell me that to start with?

29:08.581 --> 29:10.832
You live in a mansion.
You know, your dad's

29:10.874 --> 29:13.001
a movie star.
I'm... poor enough,

29:13.043 --> 29:14.420
I can't even afford
sushi, you know?

29:14.461 --> 29:17.881
You have nothing to
be ashamed about, dude;

29:17.923 --> 29:19.258
you're putting yourself
through private school.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.843
That's impressive.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.096
I'm sorry, I should've just
been honest with you.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.557
Yeah, I mean, eventually,
I'd think it was pretty weird

29:26.599 --> 29:28.601
we never actually went
inside your house.

29:28.642 --> 29:30.185
What was your plan
with that, exactly?

29:30.227 --> 29:32.187
My plan was...

29:32.229 --> 29:33.564
I don't know.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.360
I just wasn't planning on
liking you this much.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.452
♪ ♪

30:08.307 --> 30:11.393
♪ ♪

30:25.365 --> 30:27.033
Naomi?

30:27.075 --> 30:29.369
Hey.

30:29.411 --> 30:30.954
You came.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.414
Yeah.

30:32.456 --> 30:37.461
And you bought
a skinny tie.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.545
Um, actually,

30:38.587 --> 30:40.046
I made one.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.173
Turns out all you need is

30:41.214 --> 30:42.758
a regular tie and
a pair of scissors.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.260
(laughing)

30:49.014 --> 30:51.684
Come here. I want to
show you something.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.195
You doing okay?

31:04.904 --> 31:07.199
I'm not really hungry, Dixon.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.035
It's okay. You know?
It's just good to be out.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.578
Get a little fresh air

31:11.620 --> 31:13.706
in your lungs.

31:20.003 --> 31:21.505
Look, I hope you realize

31:21.547 --> 31:24.299
how much your friendship
really means to me.

31:27.969 --> 31:31.557
Please remember that.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.370
What are we doing here?
What's going on?
Silver, you
need some help.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.830
SILVER:
No.

31:54.872 --> 31:58.417
No, get me out
of here, Dixon. Please.
I'm sorry, Silver.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.836
Navid, what are you doing here?
What's going on?

32:00.878 --> 32:02.170
Silver, please.

32:02.212 --> 32:03.463
You're having one of
your episodes, okay?

32:03.505 --> 32:05.298
We're, we're here
to help you.
No.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.466
How could you?

32:06.508 --> 32:07.509
Silver, please,
come inside with us.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.469
No, I'm not going to go inside!

32:09.511 --> 32:10.637
You need help.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.013
Hey, y-you've done this before.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.849
You can do this.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.058
You have to.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.353
I can't. I-I want... I'm fine!

32:18.395 --> 32:20.522
I'm... I'm fine!

32:21.189 --> 32:22.524
I'm fine.

32:22.566 --> 32:23.692
Take me home, please!

32:23.734 --> 32:26.361
Silver, it...

32:26.403 --> 32:28.530
It's going to be okay.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.700
Why are you doing
this to me?
Hey.

32:31.742 --> 32:33.869
You know I would never
do anything to hurt you.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.203
Neither would Dixon.

32:35.245 --> 32:36.580
Please, babe, just come inside.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.875
We all want you to
get better, please.

32:39.917 --> 32:42.628
(breathlessly):
We're all here to help you.

32:50.928 --> 32:52.971
Okay.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.822
(siren wailing in distance)

33:19.957 --> 33:23.919
You wanted to show
me a telescope?

33:26.964 --> 33:29.174
All right, come here.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.592
Check it out.

33:30.634 --> 33:33.386
You want me to check out
your telescope, big boy?

33:33.428 --> 33:34.680
Oh, Naomi.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.222
(chuckles)

33:36.264 --> 33:38.391
So what exactly am
I looking at here?

33:38.433 --> 33:41.353
That is where I'm going to
college next year.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.897
That's Boston?

33:43.939 --> 33:46.650
No, that's Cal Tech.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.028
It's the California
Institute of Technology

33:50.069 --> 33:51.446
in Pasadena.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.782
Near C.U.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.325
and near you.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.285
But I thought...
It's a great school.

33:57.327 --> 34:00.163
It's one of the best in the
world when it comes to sciences.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.415
And the astrophysics
department there

34:02.457 --> 34:05.919
is... well, out of this world.

34:05.961 --> 34:08.380
But I thought M.I.T.
was your first choice.

34:08.420 --> 34:11.049
M.I.T. was my first choice.

34:11.090 --> 34:14.887
And now you are.

34:18.264 --> 34:22.435
I say, we try to
beat the odds.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.946
(knocking)

34:36.783 --> 34:37.993
Oh, sorry I'm late.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.202
I had trouble finding a place

34:39.244 --> 34:40.913
I felt comfortable
parking my car

34:40.954 --> 34:42.371
in this neighborhood.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.917
Aren't you going
to invite me in?

34:44.958 --> 34:46.418
Uh... uh, yeah.

34:46.458 --> 34:48.045
Yes. Sorry.
Come on in.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.590
Yeah, it's like
inviting a vampire in.

34:51.630 --> 34:55.342
So I thought about
what you said,

34:55.385 --> 34:57.345
and I think you're right.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.431
I think you should
be in Jack's life.

34:59.472 --> 35:01.975
Oh, I'm so relieved
to hear you say that.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.019
Because I've
been thinking
that I'm going

35:04.061 --> 35:05.562
to take him
to Paris with me.

35:05.604 --> 35:09.274
No, wait, no, Jen, you're
not taking him to Paris.

35:09.315 --> 35:11.401
Look, Jack's going to
stay in L.A., okay?

35:11.443 --> 35:12.819
In terms of custody, I think

35:12.861 --> 35:15.405
we should start you off
with two days a week.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.656
And I hate to say this,

35:16.698 --> 35:18.867
but there's no way you can be
in Jack's life

35:18.909 --> 35:20.535
without having to
be in mine, okay?

35:20.577 --> 35:22.412
We're going to have
to do this together.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.414
Wait. You and me...

35:24.456 --> 35:25.999
DEBBIE:
And me.

35:26.041 --> 35:29.335
What?!
Shh. Jack's asleep.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.297
Oh.
Debbie has been a really
important part of Jack's life

35:32.338 --> 35:34.549
for, I don't know,
six months.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.301
And that's not
going to stop.

35:36.342 --> 35:37.886
But I'm his mother.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.429
I-I know that.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.099
And I know how important
that is, believe me,

35:42.140 --> 35:45.310
but raising a child
can be really difficult,

35:45.351 --> 35:49.064
and who couldn't use
a little help?

35:50.941 --> 35:53.151
Jen, it's not going to happen
any other way.

35:54.569 --> 35:58.323
I mean, it takes a village.

36:00.617 --> 36:01.576
Okay.

36:01.618 --> 36:03.286
Well, I guess that is

36:03.328 --> 36:05.163
what's best for Jack.

36:05.204 --> 36:07.791
Okay.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.626
But I will pick out
Jack's clothes.

36:09.668 --> 36:13.672
Fashion is exclusively
my realm.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.548
You two will have zero input.

36:15.590 --> 36:17.717
And he will be going
to private schools.

36:17.759 --> 36:21.387
None of this nonsense
about supporting the
public school system.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.857
(knocking)

36:31.898 --> 36:33.817
She asleep?

36:33.859 --> 36:37.112
Uh... yeah.

36:37.154 --> 36:39.447
You okay?

36:39.489 --> 36:40.991
(sighs)

36:41.033 --> 36:42.325
Uh...

36:42.367 --> 36:44.744
I'm better.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.329
You did the right thing
bringing her in.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.289
There's no doubt
she was having an episode.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.083
You should go home
and get some rest.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.376
Do you have a ride home?

36:51.417 --> 36:54.129
ADRIANNA:
I'll drive him.

36:57.966 --> 36:58.967
Hey.

36:59.009 --> 37:01.136
What are you
doing here?

37:01.178 --> 37:03.346
I came as soon as I heard.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.265
I'm so sorry.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.728
If there's anything
I can do for you.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.731
And for Silver.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.440
NAVID:
I Just, uh...

37:14.482 --> 37:16.693
I can't believe
this is happening.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.196
I know.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.199
I know.

37:43.469 --> 37:45.013
Hey.

37:45.055 --> 37:46.347
Annie.

37:46.389 --> 37:47.432
How are you?

37:47.473 --> 37:48.850
Are you having
an okay time?

37:48.892 --> 37:51.937
No, I'm not having
an okay time.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.147
I'm having an absolutely
fabulous time.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.607
Really?

37:55.648 --> 37:57.275
Thank you.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.194
Thank you so much.

37:59.236 --> 38:01.238
I want you to have this.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.741
What? Oh, my God, no,
I-I couldn't.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.284
Yes, you can.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.870
Just say yes, Annie.

38:08.912 --> 38:10.580
(laughing)

38:14.709 --> 38:16.920
Oh, you darling.
Oh, my gosh.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.505
You are a special girl.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.383
Let me see.

38:22.425 --> 38:25.511
Well, almost as beautiful
as you are.

38:25.553 --> 38:26.805
Thank you.

38:26.846 --> 38:30.391
No, thank you, Annie.

38:33.895 --> 38:36.148
I just don't
understand why...

38:36.189 --> 38:38.191
why this had to happen to her.

38:38.233 --> 38:41.236
Sometimes there's no reason.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.405
Things just happen.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.909
Yeah, well, it's...
it's not fair.

38:47.951 --> 38:50.787
You're right,
it's not.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.248
But it's not fair
to you either,

38:53.290 --> 38:55.458
having to deal with this.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.710
It's tough.

38:57.752 --> 39:01.756
Silver's always
going to be this way.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.718
She's mentally ill.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.139
You don't just get better
from something like that.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.390
Scary.

39:16.938 --> 39:18.898
I'm an idiot.
I'm a drunk idiot.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.901
I'm so sorry for bothering
you tonight. I'm...

39:21.943 --> 39:23.444
Stop it.

39:23.486 --> 39:26.865
Hey, you're not
bothering me.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.200
Okay?

39:28.241 --> 39:30.785
Anyone would need a drink
and a friend to talk to

39:30.827 --> 39:32.996
after what you've
been through.

39:39.836 --> 39:41.213
Here.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.340
Thank you.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.353
Thank you for driving me home
tonight.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.024
Don't know what
I would have done.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.818
I'm always here for you.

40:03.860 --> 40:06.029
No matter what, okay?

40:06.071 --> 40:09.157
I'll always be right here.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.661
Navid?

40:28.843 --> 40:32.889
Marla, you're on the cover
of the newspaper!

40:32.931 --> 40:34.182
You've got to see this.

40:34.224 --> 40:35.725
Oh, you look amazing.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.893
Wait... Hey.

40:36.935 --> 40:39.812
Oh, my God, I think
that's my elbow.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.189
Marla.

40:42.190 --> 40:43.358
Marla.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.662
"My dear Annie,

40:56.704 --> 40:58.206
"I feel so fortunate

40:58.248 --> 40:59.332
"to have met you.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.709
"Thank you for the most
wonderful night

41:01.751 --> 41:03.253
"I've had in years.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.005
"Couldn't have asked

41:06.047 --> 41:08.091
for a more marvelous send-off."

41:14.431 --> 41:15.765
Oh!

41:15.807 --> 41:17.934
(sobbing)

41:20.019 --> 41:21.729
Marla...
