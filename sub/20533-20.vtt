Previously on:
ADRIANNA: I've been thinking
a lot about the other night.

00:04.296 --> 00:06.298
It reminded me of all
our old drama with Silver.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.969
(groans)
Us hooking up is so not
worth all that again.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.386
ADRIANNA:
You had a lot of great lyrics.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.555
I just... moved
things around a bit.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.140
It's exactly
how I feel about Navid.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.476
Your crush is on Navid?
Yeah.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.227
PATRICK:
The entire country
is on a witch hunt

00:19.269 --> 00:20.980
for Patterson's real identity.

00:21.062 --> 00:23.231
If you hurt my family,
I'll come after yours.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.483
NANCY O'DELL:
The stories in your book

00:24.525 --> 00:25.901
are allegedly based upon

00:25.943 --> 00:28.737
true events in your life.
Yeah.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.322
Annabelle is me.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.573
PATRICK:
I woke up to find

00:31.615 --> 00:33.116
the press on my lawn
this morning.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.284
You brought this all
upon yourself.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.412
This bag belong to you, sir?

00:37.454 --> 00:38.539
Yes.
You're under arrest

00:38.580 --> 00:40.207
for drug possession.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.542
LIAM:
Ooh. I cannot

00:41.583 --> 00:43.794
believe we signed
Cassie McCoy.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.295
My mom's my manager.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.922
She found out you live
with Annie Wilson.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.382
She doesn't want me
associated with you.

00:48.423 --> 00:50.049
NAOMI:
You don't want to give

00:50.091 --> 00:52.011
you and me a chance
because you don't

00:52.051 --> 00:53.428
think I can handle
your mother?

00:53.470 --> 00:55.806
We're just getting to know
the real Naomi Clark.

00:55.848 --> 00:58.433
I don't have to care
what you or anyone else thinks.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.185
JORDAN:
I've never seen

01:00.227 --> 01:02.229
any woman ever stand up
to my mother.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.355
Whether she likes it or not,
I want to date you.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.691
MICHAELA:
This TV contest

01:05.733 --> 01:06.942
is gonna be huge.

01:06.984 --> 01:08.652
The only reason I let you
try is because Dixon said

01:08.694 --> 01:09.987
there was no chance
that you'd win.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.446
I was just listening
to our song.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.074
Silver says it's so good
we can't send it in.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.492
Until I have this baby, Silver

01:15.534 --> 01:18.119
calls the shots.
Well, she doesn't get
to call them for me.

How could we not?

It's like a first-class
trip to Europe.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.940
That was my lawyer.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.109
I had him look
into Mark's arrest.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.568
Well, did you tell
him there's no way

03:13.610 --> 03:15.070
those drugs
could've been Mark's?

03:15.112 --> 03:16.363
Patrick must have framed him.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.823
Mark's suitcase was

03:17.865 --> 03:20.034
in the lobby when Patrick
threatened revenge.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.618
I thought he was talking
about Dixon.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.370
But you didn't warn Mark.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.039
The brother you forgot you had.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.581
I feel awful already, okay?

03:26.623 --> 03:27.791
The important
thing is

03:27.833 --> 03:30.502
is that this is Mark's
first offense,

03:30.544 --> 03:32.462
and he's innocent.
Except

03:32.504 --> 03:34.381
he's not.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.799
Apparently at the time
of Mark's arrest,

03:35.841 --> 03:38.426
he was on parole
for narcotics trafficking.

03:39.761 --> 03:40.971
(phone ringing)
And

03:41.013 --> 03:42.347
right on cue, it's my mother.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.974
I have a feeling
she's not calling to see

03:44.016 --> 03:44.933
if we had a safe flight.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.018
I got to take this outside.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.311
Mark was on parole?

03:48.353 --> 03:49.646
What are
we gonna do?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.356
We're gonna save our brother.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.275
(beeping)

03:54.317 --> 03:56.236
Miss, I need you
to remove all metals,

03:56.277 --> 03:58.197
watches, and jewelry.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.866
(chuckles)
Lovely.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.785
This could take a while.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.417
Okay, Annie was a hooker

04:10.458 --> 04:12.502
and my rap sheet
is, like, a mile long, okay?

04:12.544 --> 04:13.921
We still love you.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.255
(chuckles)
Why didn't you tell us
you were on probation?

04:16.297 --> 04:17.841
It didn't come up.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.134
Two years ago,

04:19.176 --> 04:20.635
I was working in a restaurant.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.013
Some of the kitchen crew were
dealing, I looked the other way,

04:23.055 --> 04:24.264
and when the place got busted,

04:24.305 --> 04:25.766
they found their stash
in my freezer.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.102
My lawyer said he could get
me three years probation,

04:28.143 --> 04:30.812
no jail time,
if I pled no contest.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.148
I swear,
I never sold drugs then,

04:33.190 --> 04:36.276
and I have no idea how they got
in my suitcase now.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.528
Patrick. He must have done
a background check

04:38.570 --> 04:40.614
and knew exactly
how to set you up.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.032
That creep from your book?

04:42.074 --> 04:43.324
For what
it's worth,

04:43.366 --> 04:44.618
if I ever get out,

04:44.659 --> 04:46.453
he's gonna answer
to your ex-con brother.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.412
Not "if."

04:47.454 --> 04:49.039
"When." We're your family.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.916
We're gonna take care
of everything.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.127
Thanks, but I've got problems
you can't solve.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.586
You know
that ex-wife

04:54.628 --> 04:56.463
I don't like to talk about?

04:56.504 --> 04:59.466
We sort of have two kids.

04:59.507 --> 05:00.467
What?
And,

05:00.508 --> 05:02.469
like your probation,
that just...

05:02.510 --> 05:04.221
didn't come up?
Okay, you know what?

05:04.263 --> 05:06.974
I-I am an amazing aunt. Like,
the greatest one in the world.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.558
Why would you deprive
your children of me?

05:08.600 --> 05:10.852
Because I'm a lousy father.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.271
This weekend
is their 11th birthday.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.564
I promised them a special day
and I'm missing it.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.108
Well, that's not
your fault, Mark.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.317
It's Annie's.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.444
It's mine.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.571
For years, I said
I was gonna be a better dad,

05:21.613 --> 05:23.991
but stuff came up,
work got in the way.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.492
When Naomi and I opened
the restaurant,

05:25.533 --> 05:27.535
my life settled down.
I vowed to change.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.871
I-I started seeing them
every other weekend.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.249
And when we get you out of here,
you will keep seeing them.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.876
If... I move to Vermont.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.004
My ex got a job,

05:37.045 --> 05:38.755
and I can't stop her
from taking the twins

05:38.797 --> 05:41.466
unless I show the court
that I'm an active parent.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.468
Missing their birthday
because I'm in jail

05:43.510 --> 05:46.554
pretty much makes me
the worst father ever.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.682
Even you two can't
do anything about that.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.728
(door opens)

05:53.770 --> 05:55.689
Hey. So, I figured

05:55.730 --> 05:57.983
we'd take our minds off
of the missed opportunity

05:58.025 --> 05:59.860
and my half-brother in jail
by doing something positive.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.361
Like recording some background
vocals to your song.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.826
Or we could just record the
sound of you getting diabetes.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.077
There's free bear claws
in the lobby.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.829
Michaela, everything
you eat is free.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.122
Silver buys your groceries.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.999
She doesn't buy me bear claws.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.750
Hmm.
She's gonna be

06:15.792 --> 06:17.294
so mad when she sees this.

06:17.336 --> 06:19.046
(giggles)

06:19.087 --> 06:20.881
Are you serious?
Even if you won

06:20.922 --> 06:22.549
the contest, okay--
which, by the way,

06:22.590 --> 06:24.051
was a one in a million shot--

06:24.092 --> 06:26.720
Silver was never gonna let
you go on that tour, okay?

06:26.761 --> 06:29.097
Silver wants a healthy baby;
I want a business;

06:29.139 --> 06:32.059
you want a music career;
and the only way we can have

06:32.100 --> 06:34.895
everything is if we all
work together, okay?

06:34.936 --> 06:37.272
(phone ringing, vibrates)
It's Silver.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.149
Mm-mm.

06:39.191 --> 06:41.193
(sighs)

06:42.944 --> 06:43.904
Hey.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.072
Dixon.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.240
Where's Michaela?
I came by to pick her up

06:46.281 --> 06:47.241
for prenatal water aerobics.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.575
Oh.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.911
Okay, um, I didn't know
she had anything to do today,

06:50.952 --> 06:52.620
so I booked
studio time.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.122
How could you not know about it?
I told Michaela

06:54.164 --> 06:56.291
about it last week.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.960
She deliberately forgot
because she's mad at me.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.170
Come on.

07:00.212 --> 07:01.755
Why would you even say
Michaela's mad at you?

07:01.796 --> 07:03.882
She's not answering her phone
and she's not speaking to me,

07:03.924 --> 07:05.133
and it's your fault.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.761
All my fault? Uh...

07:07.802 --> 07:09.470
I just defended you.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.431
You wouldn't have to defend me
if you hadn't talked me

07:11.472 --> 07:13.141
into letting her write
that song.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.393
It was a one in a million shot.

07:14.434 --> 07:18.188
Yeah, well, I'm not
exactly feeling lucky.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.773
(sighs)

07:19.814 --> 07:22.317
I'm sorry. Look,
I've got some things...

07:22.359 --> 07:24.736
going on in my life, and I can't

07:24.778 --> 07:27.072
really deal
with an angry surrogate, so...

07:27.114 --> 07:29.950
please fix this.
How am I supposed
to fix... Uh...

07:29.991 --> 07:31.952
Hello?

07:31.993 --> 07:34.204
Silver? S...

07:34.246 --> 07:36.998
(scoffs)
Okay, now I'm really
starting to wish

07:37.040 --> 07:39.042
that I was the brother in jail.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.254
(phone ringing)

07:43.213 --> 07:44.839
Michaela?

07:44.881 --> 07:47.175
MAN:
No, actually I'm trying
to reach Dixon Wilson

07:47.217 --> 07:49.052
of Unfaithful Records.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.346
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. Uh, he's
at the studio right now.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.347
Can I take a message?

07:52.389 --> 07:53.348
Sure.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.641
Tell him one of the producers

07:54.682 --> 07:56.435
of the Spencer Blane
tribute concert called,

07:56.476 --> 08:00.188
and we wanted to thank him
for e-mailing Michaela's demo.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.065
I'm sorry. Did you say that...

08:02.107 --> 08:04.525
Dixon Wilson sent you the demo?

08:04.567 --> 08:05.902
Yeah. In fact,

08:05.944 --> 08:07.695
Michaela's been chosen
as one of the new artists

08:07.737 --> 08:08.738
we want to debut.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.198
There's a televised concert
this week,

08:10.240 --> 08:11.325
followed by a national tour.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.618
Oh, wow. That's amazing.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.079
I can't believe
you picked Michaela.

08:16.121 --> 08:20.959
Unfortunately, her schedule
just isn't going to allow it.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.587

08:25.964 --> 08:27.632
ANNIE:
Hi, I'm looking

08:27.674 --> 08:28.925
for a lawyer.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.303
Jordan Welland
recommended your firm.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.222
Oh, great. Could one of the
partners call Annie Wilson back

08:34.264 --> 08:35.597
at this number, please?

08:35.640 --> 08:39.269
(chuckles)
Yes, that Annie Wilson.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.688
Glad your mom liked my book.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.898
(beeps phone off)

08:43.940 --> 08:46.443

No, Liam, don't stop.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.653
(women giggling)

08:48.695 --> 08:51.365
Girls, girls,
you know the rules.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.533
The loser has to sip

08:53.574 --> 08:55.327
or strip.
Ooh,

08:55.369 --> 08:57.287
human body shot.
I'm on it.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.538
My turn.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.874
Who wants to drink
out of my...
Okay!

09:00.915 --> 09:02.959
Uh, do not finish
that sentence.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.879
Liam, what the hell
is going on here?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.923
Oh, my God! Is that my good
interview blazer?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.176
(stutters)
In her defense,

09:11.218 --> 09:13.887
she wasn't wearing enough
clothes to play strip poker.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.389
(chuckling)

09:15.430 --> 09:17.432
I thought it was a sexy
librarian costume.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.476
Like Annabelle would wear
to seduce Patterson.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.061
(fake chuckles)
I'm sorry.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.729
Who are you?
They're...

09:22.770 --> 09:24.147
Leobelles.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.441
Fans of Annabelle and Leo.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.026
(woman giggles)

09:28.068 --> 09:29.361
Hmm?

09:29.403 --> 09:30.862
Oh, my gosh!

09:30.904 --> 09:32.322
You're Author X!

09:32.364 --> 09:35.283
Can we get your autograph?
Huh. Maybe at

09:35.325 --> 09:37.411
a book signing.
But right now you two

09:37.452 --> 09:39.913
need to leave my house.
Annie, don't be such

09:39.954 --> 09:42.623
a wet blanket. We were just
about to reenact chapter 23.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.252
Out! Out! Now!

09:45.293 --> 09:47.879
Bye, ladies.
You know what? Girls,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.589
you don't have
to go. This...

09:50.590 --> 09:52.551
You owe me an apology.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.261
And a new blazer.

09:54.302 --> 09:57.138
Gee, I'm so sorry.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.432
But when the surfer

09:58.473 --> 10:00.767
that I busted my ass
to sponsor dropped out

10:00.808 --> 10:03.311
because of your stupid
announcement,

10:03.353 --> 10:05.980
I had some time on my hands.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.525
Hey. Did you know
that-that our house

10:08.567 --> 10:10.569
is the first stop
on the Undressed tour?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.571
Liam, I never meant to...

10:12.612 --> 10:14.155
Lie to me? Use me?

10:14.197 --> 10:15.656
Join the club. Apparently,

10:15.698 --> 10:16.908
it's what
I'm here for.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.119
I didn't lie to you. I just

10:19.160 --> 10:20.870
didn't tell you
about the book

10:20.912 --> 10:22.330
because it was personal.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.040
Writing it had nothing
to do with you.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.043
Then why am I getting fan mail
for Leo the brooding loner?

10:27.085 --> 10:29.379
Uh, because I write
compelling characters?

10:29.421 --> 10:30.755
I'm sorry!

10:30.797 --> 10:33.300
You should be sorry
that you ruined my life!

10:33.341 --> 10:36.219
And how exactly
did I ruin your life?

10:36.261 --> 10:38.096
By being in it!

10:39.847 --> 10:43.143
Okay, look, I told the truth,
and I stood up to Patrick

10:43.184 --> 10:45.353
because it was the right thing
to do.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.605
I hate that people

10:46.646 --> 10:48.982
I care about got hurt,
but I'm gonna fix it.

10:49.023 --> 10:52.819
Don't, because everything you do
just makes things worse.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.994
(theme music playing)

11:17.051 --> 11:18.886
Why would Mark's ex-wife
move their children to Vermont?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.096
It's only a matter of time

11:20.138 --> 11:21.431
before they get that horrible
Canadian accent.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.642
Don't worry. We'll find
a lawyer that can deal

11:23.682 --> 11:25.684
with Mark's custody issues
and his narcotics charge.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.104
Someone passionate
about justice.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.106
(gasps)
Oh.

11:30.148 --> 11:32.442
Speaking
of someone passionate...

11:32.484 --> 11:34.819
Yeah, my assistant was supposed
to clean all this up

11:34.861 --> 11:36.695
before you got home.
(laughs)

11:36.737 --> 11:39.991
Had a little romantic surprise
planned for last night, but,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.826
uh, Annie's ex-boyfriend

11:41.868 --> 11:45.121
framing your brother for drugs
kind of got in the way.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.207
I really hate Annie right now.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.668
Yeah, I kind
of do, too.

11:49.708 --> 11:52.711
But maybe our next date
will be a little better.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.005
Maybe we should find out.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.298
Yes.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.217
(phone rings)
Oh.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.718
Wow.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.973
Another urgent call
from my mom.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.766
Does the woman have
a kissing sensor on you

12:05.808 --> 12:06.893
or something, really?

12:06.934 --> 12:09.062
She keeps close
surveillance on anything

12:09.103 --> 12:10.397
that might affect
her reputation.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.856
Lovely.
Yeah.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.359
And Mark's arrest just put her
in full damage control mode.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.319
God forbid that it
gets to the press

12:16.361 --> 12:17.654
that her top-selling
auction item

12:17.696 --> 12:19.239
got busted for
drugs. (laughs)

12:19.280 --> 12:21.282
Wait. So, thanks to your mom,

12:21.324 --> 12:23.159
no one else knows
that Mark's in jail?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.452
If, uh, she feels
like it's something

12:24.494 --> 12:25.537
that could hurt
her political career,

12:25.579 --> 12:26.787
it's like it never
even happened.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.415
Okay, the woman
officially creeps me out,

12:28.456 --> 12:29.832
but this is kind of helpful.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.042
Mark's hearing is on Monday.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.335
If he beats the charges,

12:32.377 --> 12:34.170
and his ex-wife never figures
out that he was arrested,

12:34.212 --> 12:35.589
he can keep the kids
from moving away.

12:35.630 --> 12:39.008
But he'll be locked up all
weekend, and kids tend to notice

12:39.050 --> 12:40.552
when their dad misses
their birthday.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.760
(laughs)

12:41.802 --> 12:43.804
That depends
on who's throwing the party.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.557
DIXON:
Silver?

12:45.599 --> 12:48.142
Michaela's back. You can
take her to that water baby

12:48.184 --> 12:50.270
birthing thingamabob.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.313
Why are my clothes
in the living room?

12:52.355 --> 12:54.524
I thought
I'd help you pack.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.026
A producer from the
Spencer Blane concert called.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.319
He wants Michaela

12:58.361 --> 12:59.820
on stage this week.

12:59.862 --> 13:00.863
What?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.198
They loved the demo
Dixon sent in,

13:02.240 --> 13:04.242
and they think your song
is going to be a big hit.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.784
Are you serious?
They liked the song?

13:05.826 --> 13:08.705
Whoa! Everybody slow down.
I never sent in the demo.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.831
But Silver's packing. That
means I'm going on tour.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.041
I got the job.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.501
Actually,
you already have a job...

13:13.543 --> 13:14.669
carrying my baby,

13:14.711 --> 13:16.795
and that's never gonna happen
on a tour bus,

13:16.837 --> 13:18.423
so I told them
you were unavailable.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.509
I'm packing your bags
because I'm moving you back

13:21.551 --> 13:22.801
to Washington, D.C.
What?!

13:22.843 --> 13:24.011
Silver, you can't do that.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.598
Actually, I can,
because we have a contract,

13:26.640 --> 13:28.975
so I'm gonna supervise
the rest of your pregnancy.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.769
But from now on,
you two aren't living together;

13:30.809 --> 13:33.187
you're not working together;
and your music career is over.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.690
Silver, you can't do that.
We just got started!

13:35.732 --> 13:37.024
This is gonna ruin everything.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.943
Who the hell could have
leaked that demo?!

13:38.985 --> 13:41.237
Adrianna.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.656
Adrianna?

13:42.697 --> 13:44.741
She had nothing
to do with the song.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.660
How could she leak it?

13:46.701 --> 13:49.287
When Silver said we couldn't
release the demo, I called her.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.956
She said she was sick of Silver
ruining things for other people.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.083
So she decided
it was her turn?

14:01.716 --> 14:03.802
(bottle cap clinks on floor)

14:05.720 --> 14:07.764
(sighs)

14:11.017 --> 14:13.060
(doorbell rings)

14:17.440 --> 14:19.317
(sighs)

14:19.359 --> 14:21.861
Look, you're hot and all,

14:21.902 --> 14:23.404
but I'm exhausted,

14:23.446 --> 14:26.032
so hop back
on your mommy-porn tour bus,

14:26.073 --> 14:27.200
and get a real life.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.159
Nice blazer, by the way.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.369
Uh, I'm Elena Burns

14:29.410 --> 14:30.704
of Burns, Seymour &amp; Gray.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.954
Annie Wilson called my office

14:31.996 --> 14:33.456
about her brother
needing a lawyer?

14:33.498 --> 14:34.582
I'm guessing

14:34.624 --> 14:36.125
the charges are
sexual harassment?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.502
Um, well...

14:37.544 --> 14:41.047
Hi. Ms. Burns, uh,
thank you so much for coming.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.549
Please, ignore my

14:42.590 --> 14:44.592
roommate. He is a total ass,

14:44.634 --> 14:47.387
unlike my brother Mark,
who's completely innocent.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.806
Why don't I take a look at
these files, and we can discuss

14:49.848 --> 14:52.058
your brother's
case?
Great.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.395
God, you could have told me
you were having a hot lawyer

14:55.436 --> 14:56.521
stop by.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.731
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.066
I totally forgot that everything
I do is about you.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.861
Here.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.195
"Australia's Top Surf Spots?"

15:04.237 --> 15:05.488
The cover girl

15:05.530 --> 15:06.781
is Maya Swan.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.282
She's the #2 female surfer
in the country,

15:08.324 --> 15:09.492
and I got you a meeting with her

15:09.534 --> 15:10.702
next week.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.495
Consider your life unruined.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.247
NAOMI:
Hello?

15:14.288 --> 15:17.250
Oh, Liam.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.752
Just the out-of-work movie star
I was looking for.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.211
I need your help
hosting a birthday party

15:20.253 --> 15:21.421
for Mark's 11-year-old twins.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.672
Wait. Mark has kids?

15:22.714 --> 15:24.674
Yeah, a son and a daughter.
He was planning

15:24.716 --> 15:25.925
a whole special day
for them, but now that

15:25.966 --> 15:27.385
he's spending the weekend
at Club Fed,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.303
well, he's not gonna make it,
but we can!

15:29.345 --> 15:31.222
It's gonna be fun!
(sing-songy):
For who?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.433
ANNIE:
Naomi, if you're trying
to cover for Mark,

15:33.474 --> 15:34.517
I think the kids are going

15:34.559 --> 15:36.185
to figure out pretty quick
that Liam's not

15:36.227 --> 15:37.353
their dad.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.479
Oh, Annie, it's so cute

15:38.521 --> 15:39.689
that you're keeping
your sense of humor

15:39.731 --> 15:42.024
during this family tragedy
you created.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.526
Anyway, I talked to Mark.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.486
Olivia, his daughter,
loves princess parties.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.740
Done. But Dylan is a sci-fi fan,

15:48.782 --> 15:51.075
and the only thing
that's gonna make his birthday

15:51.117 --> 15:53.578
dream come true is if Liam Court
from Corporate Invaders comes.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.871
Please!

15:54.913 --> 15:56.623
Naomi, nothing against Mark,

15:56.664 --> 15:59.083
but I don't do
children's parties.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.960
No. I totally understand.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.713
By the way, I read online
that Annie's book is a real hit

16:03.755 --> 16:05.047
with the retirement
community.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.966
You should stock up on calcium
chews, because tomorrow,

16:07.007 --> 16:09.886
this place is gonna be crawling
with geriatric Leo fans.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.888
What time do we leave?

16:11.930 --> 16:14.474
I'll pick you up at 10:00.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.392
(sing-songy):
I love you!

16:16.434 --> 16:19.479
(sighing):
Oh!

16:19.520 --> 16:21.731
(doorbell ringing)

16:21.773 --> 16:23.817
Come in!

16:28.070 --> 16:30.072
What is wrong with you?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.783
My nails are wet.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.117
Oh, your nails are wet?

16:33.159 --> 16:35.077
Your-your nails
are wet, huh?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.622
Dixon, you just ruined
my French tips!

16:37.664 --> 16:39.290
Okay, well, now we're even,
all right?

16:39.332 --> 16:41.250
'Cause you ruined things
with me and Silver

16:41.292 --> 16:43.294
when you leaked that demo
to Spencer Blane.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.754
How do you know about that?

16:44.796 --> 16:47.381
Because they called
and offered Michaela the gig,

16:47.423 --> 16:48.466
and Silver blames me!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.134
Wait. They want Michaela
to go on tour?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.886
Yeah.
That means
that they love the song.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.554
Of course they love it.
It's a great song,

16:53.596 --> 16:54.806
but that's not the point,
all right?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.140
Silver thinks
that I leaked the demo

16:56.182 --> 16:57.433
and that I lied to her again.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.560
Now, she's making Michaela
quit the music business

16:59.602 --> 17:00.770
and go back to D.C.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.605
What? She can't do that!

17:02.647 --> 17:05.733
Michaela singing on TV
is a huge opportunity.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.652
Was a huge opportunity.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.030
If Michaela goes back to D.C.,
I can't record with her anymore,

17:11.070 --> 17:13.867
so, you have to tell Silver
that you did it and apologize.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.035
You want me
to apologize to her?

17:16.076 --> 17:19.955
Ade, this isn't you and Silver
fighting over some guy, okay?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.333
Look, I'm trying to make things
work for everyone here.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.545
Fine. I will apologize to
the great and powerful Silver.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.088
Thank you.
But that's not going to
fix your problem, Dixon.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.256
You said it yourself.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.133
That song-- it's a hit.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.135
Which means that you're
letting Silver take away

17:33.177 --> 17:35.013
the most important
thing in your life.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.848
When has she ever given
anything up for you?

17:36.890 --> 17:38.850
At some point, you're
gonna have to stop

17:38.892 --> 17:40.142
trying to make everybody happy

17:40.184 --> 17:43.145
because Silver's only trying
to make herself happy.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.822
Seeing my head on a balloon
is just disturbing.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.407
Ugh! Don't overinflate.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.283
It makes you look jowly.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.120
All right, Mark's ex-wife, Dana,
is on her way here

18:00.162 --> 18:02.707
with Olivia and Dylan, which
means that we have exactly

18:02.749 --> 18:04.834
five minutes...
Here, give it to me.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.419
We have five minutes
to finish making

18:06.460 --> 18:09.088
this place look like every
11-year-old's dream come true.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.382
Yeah, 'cause
what 11-year-old doesn't want

18:11.424 --> 18:13.760
to spend their birthday
with two strangers in costumes?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.012
Hey, that's how I spent
every birthday since I was 17.

18:16.054 --> 18:17.638
Anyway, we have the
indoor playground

18:17.680 --> 18:20.474
and the make-your-own-sundae bar

18:20.516 --> 18:23.436
provided
by their new favorite aunt:

18:23.477 --> 18:26.689
Moi. Trust me, they will never
realize that Mark isn't here.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.441
Wait, wait.
Mark's kids don't know

18:28.482 --> 18:30.526
he's not coming to the party?

18:30.568 --> 18:32.946
No, and if it comes up,
just give 'em some candy,

18:32.987 --> 18:34.572
and distract them.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.323
Well, what if they see
through the distractions

18:36.365 --> 18:37.366
and feel even worse?

18:37.408 --> 18:39.368
Ah, then the face painter
will turn them

18:39.410 --> 18:40.494
into happy little lizards

18:40.536 --> 18:42.538
or fairies
or whatever the hell they want.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.082
Why are you being
so difficult?

18:44.123 --> 18:45.249
Because I don't like lies.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.460
People have been lying to me
my entire life.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.795
My mom pulled the same stuff

18:48.836 --> 18:50.630
to impress me
with my stepfather's money,

18:50.671 --> 18:52.339
and I hated it.
I know

18:52.381 --> 18:54.759
you think you're doing
the right thing, but the person

18:54.801 --> 18:56.469
you lie to is gonna be
the one to get hurt,

18:56.510 --> 18:57.971
just like me with Annie.

18:58.012 --> 19:00.264
And... our time is up.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.017
Please schedule your next
therapy session on the way out.

19:03.059 --> 19:07.855
Liam, some lies
are good lies, okay?

19:07.897 --> 19:09.523
It's what families do.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.150
Hi!

19:11.191 --> 19:12.652
(laughing)

19:12.693 --> 19:13.987
This is our party?

19:14.028 --> 19:15.655
This is amazing!

19:15.696 --> 19:19.117
You must be Olivia,
and you must be Dylan.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.284
Your dad's told me
all about you.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.452
He never told us
about you.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.912
Where is Dad?

19:22.954 --> 19:25.289
Oh, well, your dad
is, uh, stuck at work,

19:25.331 --> 19:27.125
but he will be here soon.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.292
You know what?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.294
I heard a rumor
that there's an Xbox

19:30.336 --> 19:31.170
in that ball pit over there.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.755
Who wants to go find out?

19:32.797 --> 19:35.382
(Naomi laughs)

19:35.424 --> 19:36.968
This is going to be fun.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.344
It certainly makes
the bouncy house

19:38.385 --> 19:40.013
I got for them look like crap.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.139
But like I told Mark,

19:41.180 --> 19:42.974
I don't like leaving the kids
with strangers.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.767
Oh. Well, we're not strangers.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.061
I mean, I'm family,
and Liam is a...

19:47.103 --> 19:49.271
Well, he's our celebrity guest.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.065
I'm gonna blow
your brains out.
(laughs)

19:51.107 --> 19:53.901
If it makes you feel any better
about dropping the kids off.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.736
(Naomi laughs)

19:55.778 --> 19:57.446
I could call Mark right now
if you'd like.

19:57.488 --> 20:00.658
It-It's fine. It's not like
I'd be able to drag them out

20:00.700 --> 20:01.951
of that ball
pit anyway.

20:01.993 --> 20:02.910
Just tell Mark

20:02.952 --> 20:03.911
to drop the kids off
by 6:00 tonight.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.330
Yes, he will drop
them off in person.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.458
Or he'll

20:09.500 --> 20:12.170
have them driven in a
stretch limo with a pool.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.295

MICHAELA:
It's a routine check-up.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.883
I don't need a police escort.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.385
I have a doctor's
appointment of my own.

20:19.426 --> 20:22.013
Plus, I need to get copies
of your medical records

20:22.055 --> 20:24.264

in Washington, D.C.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.559
Dixon is the one tagging
along for no reason.

20:26.600 --> 20:27.935
We need to talk
about this.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.937
Yeah, like we talked about
submitting Michaela's demo?

20:29.979 --> 20:31.480
Hey, maybe when
I'm not looking,

20:31.522 --> 20:34.567
you can slip it to the guy
who picks the elevator music.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.776
Adrianna leaked
the demo, okay?

20:35.818 --> 20:37.778
She also said
you only think about yourself,

20:37.820 --> 20:39.655
so, if you send
Michaela to D.C.,

20:39.697 --> 20:41.532
you're basically
proving her right.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.910
Yeah, well, I really don't care
what Ade thinks.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.161
And I think the stress

20:45.203 --> 20:47.371
of being the rope
in your game of tug-of-war

20:47.413 --> 20:49.207
is actually making me
physically ill.

26:13.655 --> 26:15.657
(Naomi laughs)

26:18.576 --> 26:20.704
You're a dead man.

26:22.873 --> 26:24.458
Ah...

26:24.500 --> 26:25.583
Hey, hey.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.752
(chuckles)

26:26.793 --> 26:29.880
My last romantic surprise
fell through, so, uh,

26:29.922 --> 26:31.382
thought I'd try again.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.466
Actually got the idea
from your book.

26:32.508 --> 26:33.509
What do you think?

26:33.551 --> 26:35.886
I think Naomi will feel

26:35.928 --> 26:37.388
just as betrayed as I did.

26:37.430 --> 26:40.766
I was going
for "commanding and sexy."

26:40.807 --> 26:42.976
Uh...

26:43.018 --> 26:44.602
everything okay?

26:44.644 --> 26:45.603
No.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.564
Mark's lawyer needs access

26:46.604 --> 26:48.648
to sealed files
in the DA's office,

26:48.690 --> 26:51.402
but that would take
an act of God

26:51.444 --> 26:53.529
or one word from someone
like your mother.

26:53.571 --> 26:55.864
By the way, your sister
stopped by this morning

26:55.906 --> 26:57.824
and wants to know why you won't
return your mom's calls.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.326
Look, yeah,
you don't understand.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.579
You're right. Uh, your family
wants to help my brother,

27:01.619 --> 27:02.496
and you said no.

27:02.538 --> 27:04.540
I don't understand.
The only

27:04.582 --> 27:06.166
person my mother helps

27:06.208 --> 27:07.501
is herself, and she
doesn't do favors

27:07.543 --> 27:08.919
without expecting
something in return.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.589
I mean, I'd be, like, making
a deal with the devil, Annie.

27:11.629 --> 27:13.673
Believe me,
you don't know my family.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.967
But I know mine.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.511
Mark could go to jail.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.636
And if that happens,

27:18.678 --> 27:20.431
I will never forgive myself

27:20.473 --> 27:22.891
and Naomi will never
forgive you.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.435
So if that means
making a deal

27:24.477 --> 27:27.521
and spending Christmas
at Grandma's next year,

27:27.563 --> 27:29.273
then I think
that's a pretty fair trade

27:29.315 --> 27:31.317
for the most important person
in Naomi's life.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.901
(cell phone rings)

27:32.943 --> 27:34.987
(sighs)

27:35.988 --> 27:37.781
(sighs)
Hello?

27:38.740 --> 27:40.159
Okay.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.494
Don't do anything

27:41.535 --> 27:44.163
until I get there.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.914
That was the lawyer.

27:45.956 --> 27:49.209
Liam just showed up at the jail
with Mark's kids.

27:51.504 --> 27:53.297
Oh, my...
(sighs).

27:57.884 --> 27:59.386
Liam, what are you doing?

27:59.428 --> 28:01.221
Mark's kids think
their dad doesn't care.

28:01.263 --> 28:03.474
They deserve to know the truth.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.809
(panting)

28:05.851 --> 28:06.893
Whoa.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.228
You okay?

28:08.270 --> 28:10.272
I just hitched a ride
with a family of nine

28:10.314 --> 28:12.316
who squeezed me into something
they called the "way back."

28:12.358 --> 28:13.609
LIAM:
Naomi, I know you're upset.

28:13.651 --> 28:14.610
Shh, Liam.

28:14.652 --> 28:16.028
'Kay.

28:16.069 --> 28:18.780
I don't know what Liam told you,

28:18.822 --> 28:20.157
but he's an actor and they lie

28:20.199 --> 28:21.492
for a living, so don't
ever believe them.

28:21.534 --> 28:22.868
(chuckles)
Who wants to finish

28:22.909 --> 28:24.662
the birthday bash with a...

28:24.702 --> 28:26.288
shopping spree?

28:27.540 --> 28:28.790
Dad!

28:28.832 --> 28:31.126
Liv. Dylan.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.878
What are you doing here?

28:32.919 --> 28:34.838
Mark, I'm sorry.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.466
It's our birthday.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.843
Yeah, I know.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.429
I just...

28:42.471 --> 28:45.015
didn't expect to be the one
getting a present.

28:50.812 --> 28:51.689
(Navid sighs)

28:51.730 --> 28:52.856
NAVID:
This feels...

28:52.898 --> 28:54.441
really wrong.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.609
Us being together,

28:55.651 --> 28:58.237
or that we just did it
in Silver's bed?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.363
I don't know.

28:59.405 --> 29:01.323
The Silver's bed part
pretty much overshadows

29:01.365 --> 29:02.282
everything else.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.784
(laughs)

29:04.826 --> 29:07.162
Navid, I'm tired
of walking away

29:07.204 --> 29:08.497
from things that
I really want

29:08.539 --> 29:10.541
because Silver
might not like it.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.585
(sighs)

29:12.626 --> 29:13.835
I know that you said

29:13.877 --> 29:15.713
that us hooking up
seems like a mistake

29:15.754 --> 29:17.339
from the past, but...

29:19.341 --> 29:21.468
I have feelings for you.

29:21.510 --> 29:24.221
I've always had
feelings for you.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.974
And I really don't
want to give them up.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.060
Why didn't you tell me
that before?

29:30.102 --> 29:32.979
Because I don't want
anyone to get hurt.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.565
Silver, I need to talk to you.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.569
Oh, my God.

29:45.367 --> 29:48.245
Michaela, let me explain.
Why? It's not like
we're friends.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.955
Yes. Yes, we are.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.624
Okay, this thing
between me and Navid

29:51.665 --> 29:53.709
started before I knew
that you liked him.

29:53.751 --> 29:56.420
But then you did know,
and you didn't mention it,

29:56.462 --> 29:59.089
and then, what, you just
slept with him again?

29:59.131 --> 30:01.800
Y... yeah, but...

30:01.841 --> 30:03.510
that just sort of happened.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.429
You know what, this actually
isn't my biggest problem

30:05.471 --> 30:07.514
right now, so if trying
to hurt me or Silver

30:07.556 --> 30:09.015
is what you're after...
No, no, no.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.058
I'm not.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.769
Okay? I'm not trying
to hurt anyone.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.646
I didn't want
to tell you about me

30:13.687 --> 30:15.481
and Navid because I didn't
want to make you feel awful.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.108
And hearing about it
wouldn't make it any better.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.276
So, yes,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.111
maybe I should have
told the truth,

30:21.153 --> 30:22.362
but with everything
going on, I didn't want

30:22.404 --> 30:23.489
to cause you any more pain.

30:26.866 --> 30:29.578
Yeah, I actually get that.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.292
DYLAN:
It was so cool how Dad

30:35.334 --> 30:36.960
got the other prisoners
in the visiting room

30:37.002 --> 30:38.003
to sing "Happy Birthday."

30:38.044 --> 30:39.588
Very cool.

30:39.630 --> 30:40.839
Though the the man who said

30:40.880 --> 30:42.174
he used to work as a clown

30:42.215 --> 30:43.925
at children's parties
was a little disturbing.

30:43.967 --> 30:44.926
OLIVIA:
But,

30:44.968 --> 30:46.720
Dad is gonna
be okay, right?

30:46.762 --> 30:47.929
Yes, absolutely.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.432
I am gonna do whatever it takes
to make sure of that.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.685
Hey, a present.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.353
Oh, uh...

30:54.394 --> 30:55.854
actually, this is for Naomi.

30:55.895 --> 30:57.523
But, uh, I think
I know something

30:57.564 --> 30:59.775
that she'll like a little more.

30:59.817 --> 31:02.486
Excuse me.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.697
Well, this was still
the best birthday ever.

31:04.738 --> 31:05.572
(laughs)

31:05.614 --> 31:07.324
Oh.
(chuckles)

31:07.366 --> 31:08.742
Just, uh, glad I could help.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.497
Hey, kids, your mom
is on the way,

31:13.539 --> 31:16.500
so why don't you have
Aunt Annie show you around?

31:16.542 --> 31:18.418
Sure there's some presents
around here somewhere.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.961
ANNIE:
That's right.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.214
Aunt Princess Naomi's
magic castle

31:22.255 --> 31:23.799
is full of hidden
treasures.

31:23.841 --> 31:25.551
Do you guys like
designer shoes?

31:25.592 --> 31:26.635
(laughs)

31:31.849 --> 31:34.267
(sighs)

31:34.309 --> 31:35.644
(sighs)

31:35.686 --> 31:37.270
Know what you're gonna say.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.773
I shouldn't take them anywhere
without telling you.

31:39.815 --> 31:41.941
(sighs):
But you...

31:41.983 --> 31:44.110
understood what they needed
more than I did,

31:44.152 --> 31:46.822
because... you know
what it feels like

31:46.864 --> 31:48.907
to be the kid everyone lied to.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.368
Yeah, something like that.

31:55.080 --> 31:55.914
(loud slap)

31:55.955 --> 31:57.750
How dare you...

31:57.791 --> 32:00.126
work out
your messed-up

32:00.168 --> 32:02.921
psychological issues
at the expense of my family?

32:02.962 --> 32:04.923
Hey, Naomi...
No, don't.

32:04.964 --> 32:06.884
I don't care
about how hurt you are,

32:06.925 --> 32:08.719
about all the women
in your life,

32:08.761 --> 32:10.596
or how you refuse
to be a part

32:10.637 --> 32:11.555
of a lie.

32:11.597 --> 32:13.181
I was keeping Mark's ex-wife

32:13.223 --> 32:15.308
from finding out
that he was in jail

32:15.350 --> 32:17.352
so that he
wouldn't lose custody.

32:17.394 --> 32:19.479
(laughs):
Thanks to you,

32:19.521 --> 32:20.939
there's nothing
to stop the woman

32:20.980 --> 32:23.650
from taking those kids to
the other side of the country.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.277
So no matter what,

32:25.318 --> 32:27.320
Mark either loses them...

32:27.362 --> 32:29.072
or I lose Mark.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.366
Naomi, I'm sorry. I...

32:32.158 --> 32:35.579
And you... are sorry.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.507
What am I gonna do
with you?

32:47.549 --> 32:49.802
That's weird: Jordan
just texted, asking me

32:49.843 --> 32:51.511
to stall the hearing
until he gets here.

32:51.553 --> 32:54.514
Oh. That gives me time to
properly style Mark for court.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.767
It's a probation hearing,
Naomi, not fashion court.

32:56.809 --> 32:59.060
Ah-ah-ah, don't-don't
make fun of fashion court.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.020
If Naomi would've got
a hundred more signatures

33:01.062 --> 33:03.398
on that petition,
it would've been real.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.275
(chuckles)
(gavel banging)

33:06.610 --> 33:08.278
JUDGE:
Calling to order

33:08.320 --> 33:09.988
the probation revocation hearing

33:10.029 --> 33:11.448
for Mark Holland.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.450
Counsel and defendant
are present, Your Honor.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.410
The purpose of this hearing
is to determine

33:15.452 --> 33:17.245
whether the terms
of probation were violated.

33:17.287 --> 33:18.789
I've reviewed

33:18.831 --> 33:21.333
the recent arrest report, which
states that drugs were found

33:21.374 --> 33:22.668
in Mr. Holland's suitcase.

33:22.709 --> 33:25.128
Your Honor, my client's luggage
was out of his care

33:25.170 --> 33:27.547
from the moment he left
the hotel until his arrest.

33:27.589 --> 33:29.424
Well, unless you
have some evidence

33:29.466 --> 33:31.635
of third-party involvement,
that's still possession.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.428
Which is why
I'm going to revoke...

33:33.470 --> 33:37.140
No, no! The drugs were planted
by her evil former sex client.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.475
Oh...
(nervous laugh)

33:38.517 --> 33:39.852
And you two are...?

33:39.893 --> 33:41.603
Um, Mark's sisters.

33:41.645 --> 33:44.189
We were there
at the time of his arrest.

33:44.230 --> 33:46.232
Did either of you actually see

33:46.274 --> 33:50.028
this alleged...
evil former sex client

33:50.069 --> 33:52.071
tamper with
Mr. Holland's suitcase?

33:52.113 --> 33:53.824
Well... no.

33:53.866 --> 33:57.035
But we're certain
his fingerprints are
all over that bag.

33:57.076 --> 33:59.496
His luggage,
not her.
Hey!

34:01.247 --> 34:03.375
ELENA:
Uh, Your Honor,
Mark Holland is not gonna

34:03.416 --> 34:04.751
contest the possession charge

34:04.793 --> 34:05.919
at this time.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.671
Well, in that case,
we can proceed to sentencing.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.255
Before you do, some new evidence
has just come to light.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.717
Uh, Your Honor,
I'm Jordan Welland,

34:11.757 --> 34:13.592
and I received
previously sealed files

34:13.635 --> 34:16.013
from the DA's office
this morning.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.472
This one contains
direct testimony,

34:17.514 --> 34:19.558
which was never entered in
as evidence,

34:19.599 --> 34:20.684
stating that
Mark Holland

34:20.726 --> 34:22.601
is completely innocent
of the original charges.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.605
Overturning the original charges
is a matter for another court.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.649
Which is why I'll
be filing an appeal

34:27.690 --> 34:29.400
immediately.
And having
already spoken

34:29.442 --> 34:31.152
to the DA's office,
they're anticipating

34:31.194 --> 34:32.445
the original charges
to be overturned,

34:32.487 --> 34:34.864
which means Mark Holland
can't be sentenced

34:34.907 --> 34:36.282
for violating probation

34:36.324 --> 34:37.909
of something he's never been
guilty of in the first place.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.538
In light of this new evidence,

34:41.580 --> 34:43.748
Mr. Holland,
I am reinstating

34:43.790 --> 34:45.792
the terms of your probation
pending your appeal.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.710
Yes!

34:46.752 --> 34:49.795
I think. What does
that mean, exactly?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.339
It means he's free to go.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.424
(laughing)

35:11.735 --> 35:13.028
It isn't a party

35:13.070 --> 35:14.988
without the guest of honor
and the champagne.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.698
I-I couldn't find a towel.

35:16.740 --> 35:19.618
This is the most unprofessional
kitchen I've ever worked in.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.370
But you'll miss it.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.498
Dana called

35:25.540 --> 35:28.376
to congratulate me
on getting out of jail...

35:28.418 --> 35:30.629
and to tell me that
she filed paperwork

35:30.670 --> 35:32.505
so she can move with the kids.

35:32.547 --> 35:36.885
Vermont is finally getting
a decent taco chef. (laughs)

35:36.927 --> 35:39.137
I have to stay in their lives.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.015
Thank you.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.683
(laughs):
For what?

35:43.725 --> 35:46.019
For having you pour
your heart and soul

35:46.061 --> 35:47.687
into a restaurant,
only to lose it,

35:47.729 --> 35:49.481
or for getting your kids
kidnapped

35:49.522 --> 35:51.399
from their own birthday party?

35:51.441 --> 35:54.111
Naomi, the truth is...

35:54.152 --> 35:57.322
I never even tried
to be a better father...

35:58.364 --> 36:00.283
...until I met you.

36:14.047 --> 36:17.009
I always did like
watching you work.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.384
Sydney...

36:18.426 --> 36:20.137
what are you doing here?

36:20.178 --> 36:22.597
If you hate me, I get it.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.391
I lied about who I was,
and I used you

36:25.433 --> 36:26.685
to get Campbell's
inheritance.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.728
Just tell me
to get the hell out,

36:28.770 --> 36:30.105
and I'll go.

36:30.147 --> 36:32.024
But I had
to tell you

36:32.065 --> 36:33.441
that I'm sorry.

36:33.483 --> 36:35.527
You know what?
We all make mistakes.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.988
I know I have.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.448
So why don't we just forget
this whole thing ever happened.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.117
Because I can't.

36:42.159 --> 36:44.243
Forget about you, I mean.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.747
I left my husband,
and-and I don't care

36:47.789 --> 36:49.248
about the money.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.292
This might sound crazy,
but I just want to press

36:51.334 --> 36:53.211
the reset button on my life
and start over.

36:53.252 --> 36:54.754
I thought that,

36:54.796 --> 36:58.175
you know, maybe you
might feel the same.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.220
MARK:
Hey!

37:02.261 --> 37:04.639
To the best lawyer
in Beverly Hills.
Seriously, Jordan,

37:04.681 --> 37:06.391
we can't tell you
how grateful we are

37:06.432 --> 37:07.684
for what
you did.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.394
Well... I can.

37:09.435 --> 37:10.395
Oh...

37:10.436 --> 37:12.355
(Naomi laughs)

37:14.107 --> 37:15.859
(sighs)

37:17.276 --> 37:19.654
Hi.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.781
Hey, I heard
about Mark's good news.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.868
The florist said nothing
says "not guilty" like daisies.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.995
Heh. That's great,
but, um...

37:27.037 --> 37:30.498
Mark's case had nothing
to do with your baby,

37:30.540 --> 37:33.085
so why do you care?

37:33.126 --> 37:34.753
That's not fair.

37:34.794 --> 37:35.879
I tried to be fair.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.296
You only care
about yourself, Silver.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.174
I showed Michaela's
surrogate contract

37:39.216 --> 37:41.760
to Annie's fancy lawyer,
and, uh...

37:41.801 --> 37:44.262
turns out as long as
she has proper medical care

37:44.303 --> 37:46.223
she can go on tour.
It doesn't matter

37:46.264 --> 37:48.141
how many votes you
and your baby have,

37:48.183 --> 37:50.643
the only vote that counts
is Michaela's.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.396
(exhales)

37:55.273 --> 37:57.234
JORDAN:
Our first and second dates

37:57.275 --> 38:00.403
were not so hot, but this one
knocked it out of the park.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.197
(laughs):
Well...

38:02.239 --> 38:04.407
it helps when the police
don't bust in

38:04.449 --> 38:06.284
and start
rounding up your family.

38:06.325 --> 38:08.954
Your brother, he, um...

38:08.995 --> 38:11.372
kind of means everything
to you, huh?

38:12.498 --> 38:14.542
I'm gonna miss having him here.

38:14.584 --> 38:19.256
But nothing can keep Mark
from being a part of my life.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.049
Or you.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.508
Mm.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.304
(phone ringing)
Mmm...
(laughs)

38:27.264 --> 38:28.890
Oh.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.516
Well...

38:33.937 --> 38:36.314
It's my sister.

38:36.355 --> 38:38.775
Then you need to take it.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.902
Family first.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.447
(groans)
(laughs)

38:45.073 --> 38:46.783
(sighs):
Okay.

38:50.245 --> 38:51.955
(sighs)

38:53.123 --> 38:55.041
(sighs)
Hello.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.709
Congratulations.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.711
I heard things
went well in court.

38:58.753 --> 39:01.714
Yeah. And tell Mom
I said thanks.

39:01.756 --> 39:04.342
Tell her yourself.
She says you owe her one,

39:04.383 --> 39:06.511
and she wants you back
in New York tonight.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.804
You know the deal, Jordan.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.347
Kiss your new girlfriend
good-bye

39:09.388 --> 39:11.141
and get on the next plane.

39:15.937 --> 39:17.355
Are you ready

39:17.396 --> 39:19.149
for date number four?

39:19.191 --> 39:21.193
Yeah. Uh, actually...

39:21.234 --> 39:24.154
I just got an e-mail
from work, and...

39:24.196 --> 39:25.864
something really
urgent came up,

39:25.905 --> 39:28.325
and I'm gonna have to
leave town on business.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.784
Oh.

39:29.826 --> 39:32.245
I'll call you
when I get back.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.206
Okay.
(laughs)

39:45.258 --> 39:47.552
(sighs) You missed
the celebration.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.346
Mark's gonna be okay.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.973
Those kids aren't
gonna lose their dad.

39:52.015 --> 39:53.350
No thanks to me.

39:53.391 --> 39:56.644
Well, moving to Vermont
isn't the end of the world.

39:56.686 --> 39:58.771
It is to Naomi.

39:58.813 --> 40:02.400
I did what I thought was right,
and it blew up someone's life.

40:02.441 --> 40:05.028
Sound familiar?

40:05.070 --> 40:09.074
But... you didn't mean
for anybody to get hurt,

40:09.115 --> 40:11.450
so eventually people
will get over it

40:11.492 --> 40:13.745
and move on. Right?

40:17.665 --> 40:20.043
That's what I
want to do, too.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.587
(exhales)

40:22.628 --> 40:24.756
I am so glad...

40:24.797 --> 40:27.675
that you said that
because I really am so sorry.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.928
And I-I will set up
a million meetings

40:29.969 --> 40:31.429
with surf stars
for you to sponsor

40:31.470 --> 40:32.638
if that's what it takes.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.974
That's... that's
not what I meant.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.601
I...

40:37.685 --> 40:39.812
Sydney came to me tonight.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.190
She made me realize
that sometimes

40:42.232 --> 40:45.610
the best way to get
past mistakes is to...

40:45.651 --> 40:49.239
hit the reset button
and start over.

40:49.281 --> 40:52.909
(sighs):
And so that's what
we're gonna do.

40:54.202 --> 40:55.661
Annie, I...

40:55.703 --> 40:57.414
I want you to buy
The Offshore

40:57.455 --> 41:00.292
so that me and Sydney
can move to Australia.

41:01.626 --> 41:03.044
(exhales)

41:06.547 --> 41:08.841
Yes, I'm sorry
I overreacted. I get it.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.303
I can't force Michaela
to go to D.C.,

41:11.344 --> 41:12.762
but you can't force Michaela

41:12.804 --> 41:14.180
to be your next
singing star either.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.266
I'm not forcing her
to do anything, okay?

41:16.308 --> 41:17.642
The only thing
that matters

41:17.683 --> 41:19.769
is what Michaela wants.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.440
Michaela!

41:24.399 --> 41:26.443
Hey, her bags are gone.

41:27.944 --> 41:30.029
So is she.
