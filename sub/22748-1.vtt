00:53.785 --> 00:55.370
You better get a hurry along.

00:58.665 --> 00:59.916
We ain't gonna make it.

01:04.879 --> 01:07.340
Oh, we will. We have to.

01:11.302 --> 01:12.929
Take a break. Come on.

01:14.556 --> 01:15.556
My turn.

01:34.076 --> 01:36.911
"We will. We have to."

01:39.622 --> 01:41.374
That was my brother, Henry.

01:42.209 --> 01:45.837
Absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would.

01:49.591 --> 01:52.802
The weather would dry out in time
to resow the cotton.

01:55.597 --> 01:58.475
We would get this hole dug
before the storm hit.

01:58.558 --> 02:00.602
God damn it!

02:00.685 --> 02:02.145
- Jesus Christ!
- What is it?

02:02.229 --> 02:03.896
It's a slave's grave.

02:04.397 --> 02:05.690
How do you know that?

02:06.358 --> 02:08.360
Shot in the head.

02:08.901 --> 02:10.570
Must've been a runaway.

02:13.448 --> 02:15.367
Well, that settles it.

02:15.450 --> 02:16.451
Settles what?

02:16.534 --> 02:19.037
I ain't burying my father
in no slave's grave.

02:19.579 --> 02:21.414
Nothing he would've hated more.

02:22.207 --> 02:23.500
Help me up.

02:25.877 --> 02:27.295
We ain't got a choice.

02:39.307 --> 02:41.101
That's it, brother! Come on!

02:41.184 --> 02:42.769
- Huh?
- That's it!

02:43.103 --> 02:44.229
Get you out of there!

02:48.775 --> 02:50.109
Come on!

02:51.569 --> 02:54.030
Come on.

02:54.822 --> 02:56.241
God damn it!

02:57.492 --> 03:00.912
- Come on, Jamie. Hang on!
- No.

03:01.621 --> 03:03.498
I'm gonna fetch a ladder!

03:04.499 --> 03:06.334
Huh?

03:09.086 --> 03:10.255
Henry!

03:23.518 --> 03:25.395
Henry!

03:25.478 --> 03:27.146
Henry!

03:27.855 --> 03:29.191
Henry!

03:30.942 --> 03:34.737
- Henry, where are you?
- Right here! I'm here!

03:36.448 --> 03:38.158
That was my brother Henry.

03:38.866 --> 03:42.412
Absolutely certain
whatever he wanted to happen would.

03:45.122 --> 03:46.666
And his little brother...

03:46.749 --> 03:47.750
Jamie.

03:48.668 --> 03:50.503
...would never betray him.

03:50.753 --> 03:55.633
Come on. Come here. Come on.
What's the matter with you? Huh?

03:55.717 --> 03:59.136
I thought you were...
gonna leave me down there!

04:00.346 --> 04:02.265
Come on. Why would I do that?

04:03.015 --> 04:04.642
Why would I do that?

04:44.516 --> 04:47.059
When I think of the farm, I think of mud.

04:48.561 --> 04:50.897
Encrusting knees and hair.

04:52.106 --> 04:55.276
Marching in boot-shaped patches
across the floor.

04:57.612 --> 04:59.572
I dreamed in brown.

05:09.582 --> 05:11.167
All right. Come on, lift it up.

05:11.251 --> 05:13.920
- Come on.
- You know, just get... Come on!

05:14.003 --> 05:17.006
- Hang on. Just let it... Hang on.
- Hold on.

05:17.089 --> 05:19.926
- Lift it, Jamie. Lift it.
- Just get a little more...

05:20.009 --> 05:21.511
Just stop, okay? Let's set it down.

05:21.594 --> 05:24.556
Why don't we just run the ropes
lengthwise? We stand at either end.

05:24.639 --> 05:27.224
No, the coffin's too narrow.
If it falls again, it might break.

05:27.309 --> 05:29.519
- Well, we can try.
- No!

05:33.064 --> 05:34.441
- Hap!
- Henry.

05:34.524 --> 05:36.233
- Hap!
- Henry, don't.

05:36.318 --> 05:38.277
- It ain't my fault what happened.
- Whoa.

05:38.361 --> 05:40.613
- I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
- Just let 'em go.

05:40.697 --> 05:41.781
Hap!

05:42.365 --> 05:43.950
Hap, can you hold on?

05:49.622 --> 05:50.957
Can you lend us a hand, Hap?

05:52.041 --> 05:54.127
Need to get that coffin in the ground.

06:00.758 --> 06:01.759
Hap?

06:03.511 --> 06:05.763
I was a 31-year-old virgin

06:05.847 --> 06:09.476
when I met Henry McAllan
in the spring of 1939.

06:11.519 --> 06:14.230
I lived with my parents
in the house I grew up in.

06:15.982 --> 06:17.817
My world was small,

06:17.900 --> 06:20.319
and he was my rescuer
from a life in the margins.

06:20.403 --> 06:24.449
Oh, really? He tells me
that, uh, you are actually a college man.

06:24.532 --> 06:25.575
Engineering.

06:25.658 --> 06:28.995
- An engineering degree from Ole Miss.
- Yes.

06:29.078 --> 06:31.581
Did you hear that, Laura?
An engineering degree from Ole Miss.

06:31.664 --> 06:32.957
My, my, my.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.752
You know, Laura is a college graduate.

06:35.835 --> 06:38.963
She got her teaching certificate from
West Tennessee State. We're very proud.

06:39.046 --> 06:42.008
Mm-hmm. My dear sister's
the smartest one in the family.

06:42.091 --> 06:45.178
Made better grades than I ever did.
Never heard the end of it.

06:45.261 --> 06:47.096
She is smart.

06:47.764 --> 06:52.769
Laura, you should, uh,
play the piano for us after dinner.

06:52.852 --> 06:53.895
Hmm?

06:54.771 --> 06:58.149
You should hear her sing.
She sings like an angel.

06:58.232 --> 07:00.610
Yeah, you should play something
for Mr. McAllan later.

07:00.693 --> 07:02.945
- Mama. Mama.
- "Ave Maria." That's my favorite.

07:03.029 --> 07:05.239
- You will love that. It's so beautiful.
- Mama.

07:05.322 --> 07:06.574
What?

07:07.241 --> 07:09.994
I'm quite sure that Teddy did not bring

07:10.077 --> 07:12.372
his new boss, Mr. McAllan,
over to hear hymns.

07:13.289 --> 07:15.583
Well, why don't we just ask him.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.168
- Mr. McAllan?
- Mm-hmm?

07:17.251 --> 07:19.962
Would you like to hear some music
after dinner?

07:25.885 --> 07:27.136
I like hymns.

07:29.221 --> 07:30.973
He likes hymns.

07:32.683 --> 07:37.855
I was unused to male admiration
and knew only that I wanted more.

07:39.774 --> 07:42.402
It was at least a reprieve
from the sincere pity

07:42.485 --> 07:45.780
and insincere kindness
directed at old maids.

07:47.198 --> 07:48.574
- Right.
- So...

07:48.658 --> 07:52.036
He didn't feel the need
to fill the air with words like I did.

07:52.912 --> 07:54.288
He had the self-confidence I lacked.

07:54.371 --> 07:55.531
- That's it?
- Uh-huh.

07:56.666 --> 07:57.500
Well...

07:57.584 --> 08:00.252
I can't say
I was truly in love with him then...

08:02.004 --> 08:05.633
but I was so grateful to him,
it dwarfed everything else.

08:08.553 --> 08:11.305
My brother Jamie's coming up
from Oxford next weekend.

08:13.182 --> 08:14.725
I'd like for him to meet you.

08:27.655 --> 08:29.616
There he is, right there.

08:29.699 --> 08:32.534
Brother! Brother!

08:40.751 --> 08:44.255
- You look good, brother.
- Likewise.

08:44.338 --> 08:46.883
The air up here in Memphis
agrees with you.

08:47.759 --> 08:49.093
Or is it something else?

08:49.886 --> 08:52.597
Miss Chappell,
this here is my brother, Jamie.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.974
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

08:55.057 --> 08:58.144
Oh, he thinks he's one of them characters
in his plays.

08:58.227 --> 09:02.690
Yes, but which play is it, dear brother?
Hamlet? Faust? Prince Hal?

09:02.774 --> 09:05.192
One of them fellas that could earn you
a decent wage someday.

09:06.694 --> 09:07.904
What do you think, Miss Chappell?

09:10.239 --> 09:12.199
I think you're more of a Puck.

09:12.283 --> 09:15.119
- Who's Puck?
- "Lord, what fools these mortals be."

09:15.202 --> 09:16.746
Puck's a kind of mischievous sprite.

09:17.497 --> 09:18.665
He's a hobgoblin.

09:18.748 --> 09:21.668
Forgive me, brother.
I'm only trying to impress her.

09:21.751 --> 09:25.129
Oh, you'll find Miss Laura is not
the impressionable type.

09:26.798 --> 09:28.925
- Shall we?
- We shall.

09:29.592 --> 09:32.845
I went ahead and told Pappy
you were here today.

09:42.730 --> 09:45.525
Uh-huh.
I wanna hear. I wanna hear.

09:46.108 --> 09:48.611
Next thing I knew,
I was sucked under,

09:48.695 --> 09:51.989
concussed and bleeding,
and I was as good as gone,

09:52.073 --> 09:55.117
another victim of the Great Flood of '27.

09:55.201 --> 09:57.829
- I can't believe you never told me this.
- There's more.

09:57.912 --> 09:58.996
Then what happened?

09:59.706 --> 10:01.708
Well, I saw a shimmering light,

10:01.791 --> 10:03.591
- like a falling star.
- "Shimmering."

10:03.626 --> 10:05.002
And a great big hand reached out of it

10:05.086 --> 10:07.421
and I thought it was God himself
come to take me.

10:07.505 --> 10:10.675
But it wasn't.
It was my dear big brother, Henry.

10:11.968 --> 10:15.429
- You saved his life. You're a hero.
- Indeed, he is.

10:15.513 --> 10:18.349
Well, what was I supposed to do, huh?
Let him drown?

10:18.432 --> 10:21.602
Here's to the future,
whatever it may hold.

10:21.686 --> 10:25.356
May you be blessed
with happiness, health, prosperity,

10:25.439 --> 10:28.568
and if she'll have you,
a house full of children.

10:31.571 --> 10:33.239
My love to you both.

10:41.497 --> 10:43.499
Bubbly.

10:46.502 --> 10:49.463
Would you mind terribly
if I had a dance with your girl?

10:54.844 --> 10:57.346
Miss Chappell, care to take a spin?

10:58.014 --> 10:59.682
I'd be delighted.

11:21.453 --> 11:24.040
Jamie saw in a different way.

11:26.334 --> 11:31.005
And when his eyes were on me,
I felt like I was no longer invisible.

12:13.798 --> 12:15.174
Thanks a lot, guys.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.638
- I'll be back.
- Absolutely.

12:32.108 --> 12:33.526
You look especially pretty tonight.

12:35.111 --> 12:37.321
Thank you.

12:37.405 --> 12:39.490
Jamie has that effect on girls.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.118
They sparkle for him.

12:44.912 --> 12:46.873
He likes you. I can tell.

12:48.249 --> 12:50.626
I'm sure he doesn't dislike anyone.

12:51.543 --> 12:55.131
Well, at least not anyone in a skirt,
anyways.

13:00.136 --> 13:03.765
Henry's marriage proposal
didn't play out like I pictured it would.

13:05.391 --> 13:09.728
He wasn't kneeling and the question
came out as more of a statement.

13:10.855 --> 13:13.524
Henry wasn't a romantic.

13:14.108 --> 13:16.485
He was made of sturdier stuff.

13:26.829 --> 13:28.372
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:28.455 --> 13:29.791
I loved domestic life.

13:31.876 --> 13:34.336
Yielding to Henry
and waiting for him to come home to me

13:34.420 --> 13:36.380
was what I'd been put on Earth to do.

13:38.883 --> 13:42.929
And when Amanda Leigh was born,
I became hers completely.

13:44.596 --> 13:47.016
Then came the day that changed everything.

13:47.933 --> 13:48.934
Forever.

13:51.813 --> 13:56.483
December 7th, 1941,

13:56.567 --> 14:00.696
a date which will live in infamy.

14:02.031 --> 14:04.074
The United States of America...

14:04.867 --> 14:07.661
was suddenly and deliberately attacked...

14:08.329 --> 14:13.084
by naval and air forces
of the Empire of Japan.

14:14.668 --> 14:18.255
The United States was at peace
with that nation,

14:18.339 --> 14:22.176
and at the solicitation of Japan...

14:23.635 --> 14:26.305
Daddy borrowed Mr. Robert
and 'nem truck to take me.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.183
That's what I remember most.

14:30.684 --> 14:33.104
The first things and the last things...

14:33.980 --> 14:36.273
they always stick the hardest.

14:38.776 --> 14:39.776
Thank you.

14:45.324 --> 14:46.492
We'll be praying for you.

14:47.659 --> 14:48.702
All right.

14:50.537 --> 14:51.737
Don't forget about us.

14:54.166 --> 14:55.542
Oh, I won't.

14:56.585 --> 14:59.463
I won't. Okay?

15:02.883 --> 15:03.926
You take care.

15:05.135 --> 15:06.136
I will.

15:08.347 --> 15:11.308
Y'all pitch in good around here, yeah?
Help your mother, now.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.979
- All right?
- We will.

15:16.563 --> 15:19.566
Keep them no 'count boys off Lilly May.
Don't let her get old so fast.

15:25.948 --> 15:28.450
- You just come back.
- I will.

15:28.534 --> 15:31.662
You come all the way back. You hear?

15:35.249 --> 15:37.668
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, too, baby.

15:55.811 --> 15:57.063
Thank you.

16:10.910 --> 16:12.578
I can't look back.

16:13.913 --> 16:15.539
I didn't look back.

16:19.919 --> 16:22.588
They say it's bad luck
to watch somebody leave.

16:27.301 --> 16:29.511
I held his heartbeat in my hand.

16:30.888 --> 16:32.348
I remember every beat.

16:34.934 --> 16:36.727
He was warm and alive.

16:38.437 --> 16:40.230
I know every place in him...

16:44.776 --> 16:47.321
and it was all I could do
to not look back.

16:49.281 --> 16:51.283
No, I don't have favorites.

16:52.368 --> 16:54.078
I love them all equally.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.080
Every mother does.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.670
But during all those four years...

17:05.297 --> 17:07.258
all that time he was gone...

17:09.468 --> 17:11.303
I only prayed for him.

17:14.807 --> 17:15.974
God will forgive me.

17:30.322 --> 17:31.365
Come on, now.

17:33.825 --> 17:35.702
Dig that hole in there.

18:01.770 --> 18:04.981
Come on, Ruel. Let's go. Come on.

18:05.065 --> 18:08.235
Keep going.
Supper's gonna be ready when we get in.

18:09.194 --> 18:10.988
What good is a deed?

18:13.865 --> 18:18.454
My grandfathers and great uncles,
grandmothers and great aunts,

18:18.537 --> 18:20.289
father and mother,

18:20.372 --> 18:25.419
broke, tilled, thawed,
planted, plucked, raised,

18:25.502 --> 18:28.714
burned, broke again.

18:29.631 --> 18:32.093
Worked this land all their life,

18:32.176 --> 18:34.762
this land that never would be theirs.

18:37.598 --> 18:40.726
They worked until they sweated.
They sweated until they bled.

18:40.809 --> 18:43.229
They bled until they died.

18:43.312 --> 18:47.691
Died with the dirt of this same 200 acres
under their fingernails.

18:48.776 --> 18:54.990
Died clawing at the hard, brown back
that would never be theirs.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.661
All their deeds undone.

19:03.039 --> 19:06.335
Yet this man, this place, this law...

19:07.002 --> 19:10.714
say you need a deed. Not deeds.

19:19.223 --> 19:21.016
Calvin Augustus got his land here...

19:22.101 --> 19:24.144
and then Bud Leo bought land here.

19:25.896 --> 19:29.858
Now I figure
there's a couple acres right here.

19:29.941 --> 19:32.278
If only fences can be put up with lead.

19:33.028 --> 19:35.447
They get taken down with lead
all the time.

19:36.698 --> 19:38.367
Won't be too much longer, Papa, will it?

19:38.450 --> 19:39.535
Around this time next year,

19:39.618 --> 19:41.495
I'm gonna have me
about 50 acres of cotton,

19:41.578 --> 19:43.664
50 acres of oats, 50 acres of rice.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.291
Fool, rice don't grow here.

19:45.374 --> 19:46.875
Never call your brother a fool.

19:47.793 --> 19:49.170
I'm gonna grow some anyway.

19:49.253 --> 19:52.798
That's why I'm not gonna be no farmer.
I'm gonna be a stenographer.

19:52.881 --> 19:55.050
- A Ste... what?
- It's kind of like a typist.

19:56.177 --> 19:59.138
- They don't allow no colored typists.
- Your sister will be the first.

20:25.038 --> 20:26.331
Honey, by the way...

20:27.207 --> 20:29.459
I bought a farm in Mississippi.

20:31.002 --> 20:34.047
And we'll be moving there
in three weeks' time.

20:39.553 --> 20:41.597
It's 40 miles south of Greenville.

20:42.431 --> 20:44.015
Big old...

20:45.141 --> 20:47.811
porch, fig tree...

20:48.770 --> 20:50.856
Girls are gonna love the four bedrooms.

20:52.023 --> 20:53.442
But we love this house.

20:53.525 --> 20:56.862
But now they get their own room each
and Pappy gets his own space.

20:56.945 --> 20:58.029
Pappy?

20:59.656 --> 21:02.075
Honey, now Mama's gone,
we gotta look after him.

21:04.077 --> 21:07.497
We got 200 acres of fertile land.
Imagine that.

21:12.628 --> 21:14.838
- You're mighty quiet.
- I'm mighty surprised.

21:16.257 --> 21:19.009
You always knew
I wanted my own farm someday.

21:19.092 --> 21:20.552
- No.
- I told ya.

21:20.636 --> 21:22.888
Henry, I had no idea.

21:22.971 --> 21:24.640
- I'm...
- I would have remembered that.

21:28.894 --> 21:30.687
Well, I'm telling you now.

21:32.147 --> 21:33.815
You're gonna love it.

21:35.150 --> 21:36.902
You will. Wait and see.

21:39.780 --> 21:40.864
Hmm?

21:55.379 --> 21:56.379
Honey.

22:51.810 --> 22:52.853
Huh?

22:52.936 --> 22:55.731
- I like the porch a lot.
- Yeah.

22:56.231 --> 22:57.316
Huh?

22:58.066 --> 23:00.151
Yeah? Who's gonna get which room?

23:00.235 --> 23:02.028
Come on, come on. Come on. You, too.

23:02.112 --> 23:04.406
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You wait up there, huh?

23:04.490 --> 23:06.575
You're gonna get the best room
for yourself, huh?

23:06.658 --> 23:08.494
Is that it, huh?

23:09.035 --> 23:10.036
Huh?

23:10.496 --> 23:12.539
What's 'round the back
over there?

23:12.623 --> 23:16.752
There should be a key right under the mat.

23:16.835 --> 23:19.129
- Go on. Get it. Get it.
- Who the hell are you?

23:21.632 --> 23:22.883
We're the McAllans.

23:23.759 --> 23:27.220
New tenants of this house. Who are you?

23:27.303 --> 23:30.181
Orris Stokes.
I'm the new owner of this house.

23:30.724 --> 23:33.685
Well, I rented this place off
of George Suddeth just three weeks ago.

23:33.769 --> 23:35.687
Suddeth sold me this house last week.

23:36.563 --> 23:38.607
He didn't say nothing about no renters.

23:39.691 --> 23:43.445
Well, looks like I'm gonna have
to refresh his memory, huh?

23:43.529 --> 23:45.864
- He left town three days ago.
- I gave him a $100 deposit.

23:45.947 --> 23:48.784
- You get anything in writing?
- No, Pappy, I shook on the deal.

23:49.826 --> 23:53.038
I gave him $100, cash,
right there in the front room.

23:53.121 --> 23:56.207
Had dinner with him and his wife. I did.
I showed him...

23:56.291 --> 23:59.920
- Y'all best be getting on.
- I showed him pictures of my little...

24:00.003 --> 24:02.881
You got swindled, boy. Damn fool.

24:03.590 --> 24:05.258
You damn fool.

24:06.301 --> 24:09.763
Never thought a son of mine would be
so damn stupid.

24:16.978 --> 24:19.815
Come on, we can stay on the farm.
There's a house there.

24:19.898 --> 24:21.058
We're gonna stay on the farm.

24:21.692 --> 24:23.819
We can make it work. Come on.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.988
Out there with the niggers
and the farmhands?

24:27.072 --> 24:29.700
There's no place in town big enough
for all of us, Pappy.

24:29.783 --> 24:32.244
Believe me, I checked.
Huh? Come on, sugar.

24:43.088 --> 24:46.341
Honey! This is it!
This is our land, honey!

25:10.574 --> 25:13.368
One of my great uncles, Uncle Willie,

25:13.451 --> 25:16.622
got a hold of a piece of land
down Reconstruction.

25:16.705 --> 25:18.081
He had a deed.

25:18.164 --> 25:22.335
Four white men on horses rode up one day,
aimed a pistol...

25:23.170 --> 25:24.546
said he was dead.

25:25.714 --> 25:27.132
My uncle's good deed,

25:27.215 --> 25:30.552
torn into 40 pieces
and thrown to the wind.

25:33.346 --> 25:36.892
And so I ask, what good is a deed?

25:44.775 --> 25:48.737
That mule made me a share tenant,
not a sharecropper.

25:49.780 --> 25:53.116
And had me dreaming
about having my own piece of land.

25:54.535 --> 25:56.286
Maybe that's where the problem started.

25:56.369 --> 25:58.079
You'll be coming to us for all your food.

25:58.163 --> 25:59.873
We're gonna be getting
all your stenographer money.

25:59.956 --> 26:03.376
Nuh-uh.
'Cause I'mma be in California or Chicago,

26:03.460 --> 26:04.794
where all the good colored jobs at.

26:04.878 --> 26:06.421
- War gonna be over by then.
- No, it won't.

26:10.258 --> 26:13.720
- But Ronsel might be home early.
- I don't want him home early.

26:14.679 --> 26:16.640
- Early means...
- He ain't coming back early.

26:17.641 --> 26:21.019
Y'all finish up.
Get these dishes rinsed off before bed.

26:45.669 --> 26:46.669
Howdy.

26:47.713 --> 26:48.922
Evenin', mister.

26:49.005 --> 26:50.882
McAllan. Henry... Henry McAllan.

26:52.133 --> 26:54.511
- You're Hap Jackson.
- Yes, sir.

26:55.428 --> 26:57.847
My family and I, we just arrived.

26:58.599 --> 27:00.475
I'll need your help to unload.

27:00.558 --> 27:02.393
- So you're the new owner?
- I am.

27:02.477 --> 27:04.237
Thought y'all weren't comin'
until next week.

27:05.689 --> 27:09.025
Need to get unloaded,
get a fire on before it gets dark.

27:09.109 --> 27:11.111
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

27:12.070 --> 27:13.321
Evenin'.

27:19.035 --> 27:20.954
Then tell him to walk.

27:21.537 --> 27:24.750
It's too far, and we don't have time.
It's getting late in the day.

27:24.833 --> 27:26.626
I ain't movin' for no nigger.

27:27.252 --> 27:29.295
He can't ride with Laura
and the girls alone so...

27:29.379 --> 27:32.883
There's no room in the back of truck.
Pappy, please.

27:49.858 --> 27:51.818
Mr. McAllan was from Memphis,
and my guess was

27:51.902 --> 27:54.988
he ain't know the eating end of a mule
from the crappin' end.

27:58.491 --> 28:02.578
Told me he intended to bring in
one of them infernal tractors.

28:03.454 --> 28:04.790
Imagine that.

28:06.374 --> 28:09.920
Using a machine to work his land
instead of the hands the Lord gave 'em.

28:10.003 --> 28:12.422
Huh? Gonna do some fishin'.

28:12.505 --> 28:14.507
You all right, Mrs. McAllan?

28:14.591 --> 28:15.800
Fine. Thank you.

28:16.342 --> 28:19.304
You better get him to fix them shutters
or we're gonna freeze to death.

28:19.387 --> 28:22.107
We gotta get that truck unloaded
before that rain comes down.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.643
Just leave it right here.

28:28.146 --> 28:30.732
You relax yourself there, Pappy.
We'll take it.

28:30.816 --> 28:33.234
Girls are done in. I need their blankets.

28:33.860 --> 28:35.028
All right.

28:35.779 --> 28:37.906
There has to be some in here somewhere.

28:38.782 --> 28:40.200
All right, girls, come on.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.911
- Just stack 'em in the corner.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:47.165 --> 28:51.294
"A Tale of Two Cities.

28:51.920 --> 28:53.171
Wuthering..."

28:53.254 --> 28:54.254
You can read?

28:55.090 --> 28:56.758
My son Ronsel taught me.

28:56.842 --> 28:59.010
He gonna be fightin' under General Patton.

28:59.094 --> 29:01.805
You mean diggin' ditches
and peelin' potatoes?

29:01.888 --> 29:03.765
No, sir, he a tank commander.

29:03.849 --> 29:07.518
Oh, there's no way the army's gonna
turn a tank worth thousands of dollars

29:07.602 --> 29:08.812
over to a nigger.

29:09.395 --> 29:11.481
Now my son Jamie,
now there's a fighting man.

29:11.564 --> 29:13.859
He's flying bombers.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.279
Uh, my son's a sergeant. 761st Battalion.

29:18.363 --> 29:19.823
Calls 'em the Black Panthers.

29:19.906 --> 29:21.407
Hey.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.326
Boy.

29:23.409 --> 29:25.996
You know what they call a nigger
with stripes?

29:27.580 --> 29:29.499
A raccoon.

29:31.752 --> 29:33.586
Honey, where you wanna put this piano?

29:33.669 --> 29:35.505
Let me get the girls to bed first.

29:35.588 --> 29:37.590
Ain't no room for that piano.
Where am I gonna sleep?

29:37.673 --> 29:38.925
We'll have to put you in the lean-to.

29:39.009 --> 29:40.468
I ain't sleepin' out there.

29:40.551 --> 29:42.888
- It don't even have a floor.
- Henry, please.

29:42.971 --> 29:44.806
- There's no room.
- Get rid of that piano,

29:44.890 --> 29:48.351
we can put a bed right there.
Put a curtain around it.

29:48.434 --> 29:49.644
It's true, we could.

29:49.728 --> 29:51.562
I don't want a bedroom
in the living room.

29:51.646 --> 29:52.814
She puttin' me out.

29:52.898 --> 29:55.498
- We're not puttin' you out.
- Henry, may I speak to you in private?

29:55.525 --> 29:57.027
- Honey! Not puttin' you out.
- Henry.

29:57.110 --> 30:00.030
When you told me that you were bringin' me
to this godforsaken place,

30:00.113 --> 30:01.031
I barely said a word.

30:01.114 --> 30:03.491
When you informed me he was comin'
to live with us, I went along.

30:03.574 --> 30:05.201
And when Orris Stokes told you

30:05.285 --> 30:07.787
you'd been fleeced by that man you rented
the house from, I kept my mouth shut.

30:08.329 --> 30:10.915
But I am tellin' you now,
we are not gettin' rid of that piano.

30:10.999 --> 30:13.251
It's the one civilized thing
in this place.

30:13.334 --> 30:16.171
So your father can either sleep
in the lean-to or in the bed with you,

30:16.254 --> 30:18.054
because I'm not stayin' here
without my piano.

30:18.131 --> 30:19.758
You know what? You're overtired.

30:19.841 --> 30:21.092
No, I'm not.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.596
God damn it!

30:32.812 --> 30:34.132
My great-great-granddaddy

30:34.189 --> 30:36.816
and his slaves built the farm
that I grew up on.

30:38.568 --> 30:40.403
One time, my granddaddy told me to go out,

30:40.486 --> 30:43.364
grab a handful of dirt from the yard
and bring it in.

30:44.324 --> 30:47.452
He said, "What are you holdin', son?"
And I said, "Dirt."

30:48.119 --> 30:49.954
"That's right. Now give it to me."

30:50.705 --> 30:53.917
So I did, and he says,
"Now what's this I've got in my hand?"

30:55.210 --> 30:56.336
"Dirt," I says.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.714
"No, boy, this is land that I've gotten.
Do you know why?"

31:01.466 --> 31:04.928
Because I own it. Because it's mine.

31:05.595 --> 31:07.096
"And one day, it'll be yours."

31:08.389 --> 31:10.809
Except that land never became mine.

31:10.892 --> 31:13.186
No, Pappy sold it after the flood.

31:14.479 --> 31:16.815
He told people
that the river wiped him out.

31:17.983 --> 31:19.567
But that was just a lie.

31:21.111 --> 31:23.654
He walked away from that land gladly.

31:40.046 --> 31:42.423
The army made Jamie a bomber pilot.

31:43.424 --> 31:45.301
It was my fault that he's up there.

31:46.302 --> 31:49.055
I made him promise
if he ever had to be a soldier,

31:49.138 --> 31:50.765
he would get up to the sky.

31:51.807 --> 31:54.227
They say battle is cleaner up there.

31:54.310 --> 31:56.430
It all looks clear.

32:00.316 --> 32:01.985
Adam's on the left.

32:03.069 --> 32:04.695
He sure is.

32:05.905 --> 32:06.905
All right.

32:09.117 --> 32:13.038
Missed my daughter's birthday.
She's not too happy about that.

32:13.663 --> 32:16.582
We'll get back soon.
I'll get you back safe, Rog.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.543
All right, I'll hold you to that.

32:19.168 --> 32:21.671
You got your pinup girl. I got mine.

32:22.255 --> 32:24.215
Yeah, but mine's from a magazine.

32:29.929 --> 32:31.222
Dear family...

32:33.808 --> 32:37.645
I'm writing you
from a village in Belgium called Tillet.

32:39.898 --> 32:43.443
Belgium is a country just north of France,
and it's beautiful.

32:44.110 --> 32:47.739
Daddy would like it around here.
There's lots of farms.

32:47.822 --> 32:49.449
What's this?

32:50.033 --> 32:52.076
- "Come out fighting"?
- Yeah, man.

32:52.410 --> 32:53.953
Of course,
by the time you get this,

32:54.037 --> 32:55.997
I'll probably be long gone from here.

32:56.998 --> 32:59.209
We always seem to be on the move.

32:59.292 --> 33:01.836
- Man all guns!
- On me!

33:01.920 --> 33:03.629
Move out! Let's go!

33:03.713 --> 33:05.798
Come on! Roll out! Roll out!

33:09.510 --> 33:12.055
- These people ready to go?
- Let's move!

33:17.560 --> 33:18.894
Did you shoot your horse?

33:18.979 --> 33:21.139
- What kind of man shoots his horse, Carl?
- Someone...

33:21.189 --> 33:23.524
- Can't even get his feeding on time.
- My horse ate my tobacco!

33:23.608 --> 33:25.648
- It's my property!
- Carl, I've heard enough, okay?

33:25.693 --> 33:26.861
I don't wanna hear no more!

33:26.945 --> 33:29.530
Okay? If you can't do your job,
I can't keep you on!

33:29.614 --> 33:30.991
- Henry, no.
- Now, you know that!

33:31.074 --> 33:32.450
Henry. Henry, I got...

33:32.533 --> 33:35.245
Please. I got Vera and the girls
and I got one on the way!

33:35.328 --> 33:36.829
- I mean...
- Man, I got...

33:36.912 --> 33:38.206
I got a wife. I got kids, Carl.

33:38.289 --> 33:41.459
- I don't got anyplace else to go.
- I got a wife. I got kids, okay?

33:41.542 --> 33:42.835
I'm runnin' a farm, not a charity.

33:42.918 --> 33:44.879
- You got till the end of the week!
- Please!

33:44.963 --> 33:46.839
The end of the week.

33:46.922 --> 33:48.383
Then I want you gone!

34:26.295 --> 34:29.257
Violence is part and parcel
of country life.

34:30.882 --> 34:33.553
You're forever being assailed
by dead things.

34:36.597 --> 34:41.561
Dead mice, dead rabbits, dead possums.

34:42.228 --> 34:43.728
You find them in the yard.

34:44.313 --> 34:46.607
You smell them rottin' under the house.

34:47.483 --> 34:49.735
And then there are the creatures
you kill for food.

34:50.485 --> 34:56.451
Chickens, hogs, deer, frogs, squirrels.

34:57.118 --> 35:03.333
Pluck, skin, disembowel, debone, fry.

35:04.834 --> 35:07.587
Eat, start again, kill.

35:10.715 --> 35:13.134
I learned how to stitch up
a bleeding wound...

35:13.801 --> 35:15.678
load and fire a shotgun...

35:16.512 --> 35:20.224
reach into the womb of a heavin' sow
to deliver a breeched piglet.

35:21.934 --> 35:23.686
My hands did these things...

35:24.729 --> 35:26.606
but I was never easy in my mind.

35:32.445 --> 35:33.946
Howdy, Mrs. McAllan.

35:35.948 --> 35:37.617
Hello, Miss...

35:37.700 --> 35:40.245
Vera. You can call me Vera.

35:40.870 --> 35:42.080
Hello, Vera.

35:42.163 --> 35:44.082
This here's one of my daughters, Alma.

35:46.209 --> 35:48.002
We need to talk to you.

36:10.358 --> 36:12.067
You can't put us off.

36:13.027 --> 36:13.944
Excuse me?

36:14.028 --> 36:16.322
We ain't got nowhere to go
if you put us out.

36:16.822 --> 36:19.284
Ain't nobody gonna hire us this late
in the season.

36:20.785 --> 36:23.663
It's not up to me, Vera.
It's up to my husband.

36:23.746 --> 36:26.040
I'm asking you to keep us on.

36:26.124 --> 36:28.417
I'm tellin' you it's not my decision.

36:31.129 --> 36:32.713
And if it was?

36:37.385 --> 36:38.719
Alma.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.075
Dear family...

37:02.577 --> 37:04.620
The locals treat us real nice.

37:05.830 --> 37:08.333
They ain't like the white folks back home.

37:10.459 --> 37:11.836
I get homesick.

37:12.503 --> 37:15.965
And they do all they can
to make us feel right at home.

37:17.717 --> 37:19.219
I'm mighty grateful for that.

37:20.595 --> 37:21.846
Ronsel.

37:34.984 --> 37:36.819
Henry!

37:38.821 --> 37:39.822
Henry!

37:41.366 --> 37:43.534
- What?
- Henry, your wife wants you.

37:43.618 --> 37:47.121
Isabelle's sick and the other one's
comin' down with it, too.

37:47.205 --> 37:49.081
I'm comin'!

37:51.083 --> 37:53.961
It's whooping cough. Go get the doctor.

37:54.044 --> 37:56.422
And tell your father
to put water on to boil.

37:57.340 --> 37:58.466
Henry, go!

37:59.008 --> 38:00.008
Go!

38:20.821 --> 38:24.074
"I wish you were all there to see it."

38:24.158 --> 38:28.913
Her dress was so glitty... glittery.

38:29.580 --> 38:34.001
Even the white GI's couldn't
take their eyes off her.

38:34.669 --> 38:36.837
Tell Lilly May

38:37.797 --> 38:43.386
even the great Lena Horne hasn't got
half the voice she does.

38:44.262 --> 38:49.309
Make sure Ruel stays practicing
his fastball.

38:49.975 --> 38:52.312
Tell Marlon.

38:53.479 --> 38:59.318
I tried to save him some snow,
but it melted.

38:59.402 --> 39:04.907
"So I'll be bringin' him
a glass of water instead."

39:04.990 --> 39:06.534
All right.

39:08.494 --> 39:09.412
"And..."

39:15.250 --> 39:17.044
- Hap!
- Comin', sir!

39:19.505 --> 39:21.757
Hap, I need your wife. I need Florence.

39:21.841 --> 39:23.634
My girls are comin' down sick
with a whooping cough,

39:23.718 --> 39:26.637
and I can't get to town on account
of the bridge been washed out.

39:26.721 --> 39:28.681
I remember you said she was a midwife.

39:28.764 --> 39:31.183
- My wife ain't no doctor, sir.
- I realize that, Hap,

39:31.266 --> 39:33.102
but my wife needs some help
and I thought...

39:33.185 --> 39:36.939
- When did they start the whooping?
- Isabelle started a couple of days ago

39:37.022 --> 39:39.775
and Amanda Leigh started coughing
a few hours back.

39:39.859 --> 39:40.859
They still catching.

39:40.901 --> 39:43.904
She can get you some remedies to take,
but she can't go with you, sir.

39:44.697 --> 39:45.740
I can pay you.

39:47.408 --> 39:49.702
I won't be able to come home
for about three or four days.

39:49.785 --> 39:51.996
- Who's gonna look after my own family?
- Please.

39:52.079 --> 39:53.873
My wife is afraid.

40:05.259 --> 40:08.178
I didn't have the luxury
of only lovin' my own children.

40:10.598 --> 40:13.601
My own mother, I remember being blue.

40:14.643 --> 40:16.354
Blue from the dark of the mornin'.

40:17.146 --> 40:19.106
When the moon would still be up,

40:19.189 --> 40:21.567
she kissin' me and my sisters
on the eyelids,

40:21.651 --> 40:23.152
us pretendin' to be asleep.

40:24.445 --> 40:26.155
She goin' off to work...

40:27.073 --> 40:29.909
to wake and kiss some other woman's
children in the sunlight.

40:30.535 --> 40:33.704
I swore that my own children would have
all of me.

40:35.247 --> 40:37.087
Mind your step.

40:37.375 --> 40:38.626
- This is Florence.
- Who's this?

40:38.709 --> 40:39.627
She's a midwife.

40:39.710 --> 40:42.171
- Do you see anybody giving birth here?
- The bridge is washed out.

40:42.254 --> 40:43.839
- She might be able to help.
- The girls need a doctor...

40:43.923 --> 40:44.799
Damn bridge is flooded.

40:44.882 --> 40:46.442
- What do you want me to do?
- Take her.

40:52.682 --> 40:54.725
I've seen this with my own children.

40:54.809 --> 40:56.729
We gotta get liquid down 'em.

40:56.811 --> 40:59.439
But first we gotta clear out
some of this phlegm.

40:59.522 --> 41:01.982
And that's real good
you makin' that steam for 'em.

41:02.608 --> 41:04.902
Mr. McAllan, would you kindly boil
some more water, sir.

41:04.985 --> 41:06.737
I want Mama!

41:06.821 --> 41:09.114
That'll draw the phlegm
right out of them.

41:09.198 --> 41:11.992
I should've taken them to the doctor
as soon as they started coughing.

41:12.076 --> 41:13.619
If anything happens...

41:15.955 --> 41:18.416
Now I know
what my mother must've known.

41:19.083 --> 41:20.460
Your girls are gonna be just fine.

41:20.543 --> 41:21.752
Okay.

41:21.836 --> 41:25.130
That if something had ever
happened to that other woman's children,

41:26.131 --> 41:28.133
that would have been the end of us.

41:29.802 --> 41:33.514
Now I know that she left us
not just out of duty...

41:34.140 --> 41:36.016
- but out of love.
- I'm thirsty.

41:37.059 --> 41:40.104
Do you hear me, gal? I want some damn...

41:40.688 --> 41:42.648
- You put that knife up to me...
- Now I know...

41:42.731 --> 41:46.026
- I will slap the piss out of you.
- That love is a kind of survival.

41:46.110 --> 41:48.230
We're taking hits.
What's going on back there?

41:48.278 --> 41:51.118
I have visual. I have visual.
Bring it around. Bring it around.

41:51.198 --> 41:52.950
They took out the tail gunner!

41:55.119 --> 41:56.286
Take it down!

42:01.751 --> 42:03.210
I need some altitude.

42:03.293 --> 42:06.213
Grab a left! Grab a left!
Pull it up!

42:06.296 --> 42:07.840
Here we go, Captain!

42:12.052 --> 42:16.515
Roger! Hey, hey! Roger!

42:16.599 --> 42:18.433
We broke formation!

42:19.143 --> 42:20.478
Roger, come on!

42:21.270 --> 42:23.022
Front gunner, are you up there?

42:23.105 --> 42:25.357
I'm still with you!
I got him! I got him!

42:27.693 --> 42:30.488
- We got some coming on the left!
- I see 'em!

42:32.448 --> 42:36.494
Cover me! Cover me!

42:43.167 --> 42:44.168
Oh, no!

42:47.296 --> 42:48.839
No!

43:14.406 --> 43:15.406
Mama?

43:17.409 --> 43:18.619
Mornin'.

43:19.662 --> 43:21.539
Glad to see you feelin' better.

43:25.918 --> 43:27.878
Well, we have
some good news for ya.

43:27.962 --> 43:29.672
We'd like to offer you a job.

43:30.256 --> 43:31.507
Workin' here for me.

43:32.382 --> 43:33.926
I'll need help with the girls.

43:34.009 --> 43:36.053
Cookin', cleanin', that sort of thing.

43:38.055 --> 43:40.558
It means extra money
for you and your family.

43:44.228 --> 43:46.105
We don't belong to them.

43:47.857 --> 43:51.694
We pay rent, work our crops for us.
That's it.

43:51.777 --> 43:53.988
They can't just pick us up,
set us down like we tools.

43:54.655 --> 43:56.782
You're the one
always talkin' about saving,

43:56.866 --> 43:59.910
how owning our own parcel the only way
to get out from under their foot.

43:59.994 --> 44:02.955
- We right there.
- I don't want you workin' for them.

44:03.038 --> 44:06.000
I won't be workin' for them.
I'd be workin' for us.

44:06.083 --> 44:07.751
I already said yes.

44:10.630 --> 44:14.634
"For the husband is the head of the wife,
even as Christ is the head of the church."

44:14.717 --> 44:18.012
"An excellent wife, who can find?"

44:18.095 --> 44:19.930
She's more precious than jewels.

44:20.014 --> 44:24.143
"Her husband trust in her,
and he will have no lack of gain."

44:26.854 --> 44:28.397
All those Sundays.

44:29.815 --> 44:32.735
- You really are listenin', huh?
- Yes.

44:32.818 --> 44:35.070
And now you must listen to me.

44:43.453 --> 44:45.915
"In my father's house are many mansions."

44:47.166 --> 44:50.169
I know that to be so.
If it wasn't so, I would've told you.

44:51.796 --> 44:53.923
I go to prepare a place for you.

44:55.424 --> 44:59.011
"That where I am, ye may be also."

45:01.346 --> 45:03.057
I know that brings me comfort.

45:04.641 --> 45:06.852
It brings me comfort to know that...

45:07.770 --> 45:09.229
one day, my getting up gonna be

45:09.313 --> 45:11.356
just a little bit easier
than it was the day before.

45:13.192 --> 45:14.694
One mornin'...

45:15.444 --> 45:17.654
my children ain't gonna wake up
to this place.

45:18.781 --> 45:21.533
They gonna open their eyes up
on a new sky.

45:22.785 --> 45:27.581
One mornin', we're gonna break this boot
from 'round our neck

45:27.665 --> 45:30.000
and shake these chains
from 'rounds our feets.

45:31.001 --> 45:32.962
One mornin'.

45:33.045 --> 45:36.173
And I ain't talkin' about the hereafter.
I'm talkin' about the right now.

45:36.256 --> 45:37.256
Right now!

45:37.717 --> 45:40.344
- One mornin'!
- One mornin'!

45:40.427 --> 45:41.595
I said...

46:32.772 --> 46:34.064
Fire!

46:34.148 --> 46:35.065
Fire!

46:36.691 --> 46:38.861
Nice shot, baby! Nice shot!

46:42.447 --> 46:44.825
Out of the tank! Out of the tank!

46:47.912 --> 46:52.374
Out, out, out!
Out of the tank! Out of the tank!

46:54.168 --> 46:55.669
Dad! Dad!

46:59.298 --> 47:00.674
I got you!

47:01.842 --> 47:04.094
Move! Move! Move! Get down!

47:05.763 --> 47:08.390
I need a medic! I need a medic!

47:52.142 --> 47:55.520
Lingered along. Lingered along.

47:58.315 --> 48:01.944
Laid in that bed knowing
my wife out doin' my work for me.

48:03.988 --> 48:06.281
Florence's hands all blistered up.

48:08.075 --> 48:11.453
And I seen her rubbin' her back
when she thought I wasn't lookin'.

48:34.184 --> 48:36.353
The rain came that next day.

48:37.729 --> 48:40.983
A big, hard rain that packed the fields
tight as wax.

48:48.699 --> 48:49.825
Nothin' we could do.

48:51.201 --> 48:56.498
Sat there, watchin' and frettin'
for two days till it finally cleared up.

49:26.653 --> 49:28.322
Hap, you in there?

49:28.405 --> 49:29.614
Yes, sir.

49:34.536 --> 49:37.372
- How you feelin'?
- Gettin' better by the day, sir.

49:38.290 --> 49:40.375
Well, you look like
you know what you're doing there.

49:41.210 --> 49:42.586
Family tradition.

49:42.669 --> 49:45.172
How much longer you reckon
you're gonna be laid up for?

49:45.965 --> 49:49.426
Oh, well, Doc Turpin says six weeks.
It's already been four.

49:49.509 --> 49:51.178
I bet I'll be out there by Monday.

49:51.720 --> 49:54.139
- Monday, you reckon? Well...
- Yes, sir.

49:54.931 --> 49:56.808
I'll come to it. I don't...

49:56.892 --> 50:00.270
I don't think you're gonna get everythin'
in the ground on time.

50:01.771 --> 50:03.232
You're cuttin' it close.

50:05.025 --> 50:08.695
Florence and the boys are
out there workin' double time, sir.

50:08.778 --> 50:11.823
And you know field needs to be rebroke
'cause of that rain.

50:11.906 --> 50:15.285
Mmm, don't I know it? Yeah,
wish we could control the rain.

50:16.161 --> 50:18.914
Y'all ought to be
well into plantin' by now,

50:18.998 --> 50:21.041
and you haven't even
gotten your fields laid by.

50:22.501 --> 50:26.296
Can't afford to wait any longer, Hap.
You're a farmer. You understand that.

50:26.963 --> 50:28.298
Yes, sir.

50:30.050 --> 50:31.510
Of course, if you had a mule...

50:33.470 --> 50:35.055
you'd be done in no time.

50:36.598 --> 50:39.393
- We lost that mule to lockjaw, sir.
- I know.

50:40.644 --> 50:42.021
Florence and the boys out there...

50:42.104 --> 50:43.944
You're gonna have to rent one
of my mules, Hap.

50:44.856 --> 50:46.942
You'll go on half shares
till you pay it off.

50:51.405 --> 50:54.074
Send one of your boys around after dinner
to fetch that mule.

50:55.700 --> 50:56.951
Yes, sir.

52:53.568 --> 52:55.779
Honey, by the way,
I forgot to tell ya.

52:55.862 --> 52:57.864
Florence ain't gonna be able
to work with us for a while.

52:57.947 --> 53:00.116
What do you mean
Florence isn't comin' back?

53:00.200 --> 53:03.995
Well, not till the end of July, anyways.
Until we get the seed in the ground.

53:04.078 --> 53:07.499
- Where's Hap?
- Hap broke his leg. I told ya.

53:07.582 --> 53:08.708
- No.
- I did.

53:08.792 --> 53:09.959
- You didn't, Henry.
- I did.

53:10.043 --> 53:12.283
I need help with the girls.
Can't you lend them a mule...

53:12.337 --> 53:15.048
No, I can't lend him a mule.

53:15.131 --> 53:16.758
You don't just lend somebody a mule.

53:17.217 --> 53:20.178
Why don't I just give 'em the whole farm
while I'm at it?

53:22.306 --> 53:25.141
I mean, if they can't get the seed
in the ground in time,

53:25.225 --> 53:28.228
they need to rent one of ours,
and they can pay us a half share for it.

53:28.312 --> 53:30.564
It's tough on them, but it's good for us.

53:30.647 --> 53:32.023
Hap hurt himself working for us.

53:32.106 --> 53:35.610
No, Laura, Hap Jackson hurt himself
workin' for Hap Jackson.

53:35.694 --> 53:38.029
- Farming's a business.
- I just think...

53:38.112 --> 53:41.616
You just think. Well, I just sank
everything we have into this farm.

53:41.700 --> 53:42.700
Everything.

53:43.285 --> 53:47.038
We need to make some money this year,
or our family's in trouble.

53:48.206 --> 53:49.624
Now, do you understand that?

53:53.378 --> 53:54.378
Do you?

53:55.088 --> 53:56.172
Yes, Henry.

53:57.882 --> 54:00.302
All right, then. Hmm? Come on.

54:03.179 --> 54:07.684
8-30-62.

54:10.729 --> 54:14.858
The date the Confederate forces crushed
the Union army in the Battle of Richmond.

54:16.192 --> 54:19.112
I don't think he knew
that I knew the combination.

54:24.826 --> 54:28.413
- Hello. Mrs. Jackson?
- Yes?

54:28.496 --> 54:32.792
I'm Dr. Pearlman.
I'm here to treat your husband.

54:33.377 --> 54:37.088
Oh, thank you. Come in.

54:44.220 --> 54:46.473
If you'd asked me before then,

54:46.556 --> 54:48.934
I'd have told you
all white folks was the same.

55:05.158 --> 55:07.118
Henry stayed mad at me...

55:08.036 --> 55:10.413
and he showed it by ignoring me
in our bed.

55:13.082 --> 55:16.085
I hadn't always enjoyed
Henry's lovemaking,

55:16.169 --> 55:18.087
but it made me feel like a true wife.

55:35.897 --> 55:37.899
I never thought of refusin' him.

55:39.818 --> 55:41.445
How could he refuse me?

55:48.034 --> 55:51.705
This is a solemn but glorious hour.

55:52.289 --> 55:54.749
General Eisenhower informs me...

55:55.249 --> 56:00.339
that the forces of Germany
have surrendered to the United Nations.

56:01.089 --> 56:04.801
The flags of freedom fly all over Europe.

56:06.219 --> 56:10.181
For this victory,
we join in offering our thanks

56:10.264 --> 56:14.185
to the providence
which has guided and sustained us...

56:36.375 --> 56:39.461
- Hitler is dead!
- War is over!

56:41.921 --> 56:43.548
Hitler's dead!

57:06.237 --> 57:07.906
This is over, yes?

57:19.543 --> 57:20.919
War is over!

57:22.754 --> 57:24.338
Boom!

57:24.423 --> 57:26.841
We're in enemy territory.
We're in enemy territory.

57:26.925 --> 57:29.428
You dead, cracker, you dead!

57:31.430 --> 57:33.848
We're runnin' over 'em.
Watch your right, gunner.

57:48.071 --> 57:49.072
Bang!

57:50.114 --> 57:51.114
You dead.

57:59.082 --> 58:01.668
Saturday was my favorite day of the week.

58:03.628 --> 58:06.465
It was the only day I felt truly clean.

58:06.548 --> 58:08.800
- Am I sitting down?
- Yes. Sit down.

58:09.884 --> 58:13.430
The rest of the time, we stank.

59:03.897 --> 59:05.899
Mama, somebody's coming!

59:05.982 --> 59:09.443
- Uncle Jamie!
- Uncle Jamie!

59:09.527 --> 59:11.863
Now come give
your Uncle Jamie a hug.

59:12.572 --> 59:13.615
Who's that?

59:13.698 --> 59:15.617
Is that my little Amanda doll?

59:15.700 --> 59:18.161
- And who is this? My little Bella.
- Jamie!

59:18.244 --> 59:20.705
- Oh! Give your Uncle Jamie a hug!
- Jamie! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

59:20.789 --> 59:23.625
- You have grown so big!
- Whoo-hoo! Jamie!

59:23.708 --> 59:26.460
- Now, who's that?
- Oh!

59:26.545 --> 59:27.754
Come on, girls.

59:30.381 --> 59:31.758
You look good, brother.

59:32.217 --> 59:33.593
You look like hell.

59:34.218 --> 59:36.499
- Don't sugarcoat it now.
- "Don't sugarcoat it." Come on!

59:37.263 --> 59:38.347
Huh?

59:38.431 --> 59:39.891
You see him in his uniform?

59:39.974 --> 59:41.768
Oh, my sweet sister-in-law.

59:42.602 --> 59:44.979
- Welcome home, Jamie.
- Come here.

59:47.649 --> 59:50.652
- All right.
- You gonna see what he's got? Huh?

59:52.946 --> 59:55.532
How you enjoyin' it here
in Henry's version of paradise?

59:56.533 --> 01:00:00.119
You'd think a son would see fit
to say hello to his own father.

01:00:00.203 --> 01:00:03.540
Oh, dearest Pappy.
God, how much I missed you.

01:00:03.623 --> 01:00:06.250
He's missed you, too,
though he won't admit it.

01:00:08.044 --> 01:00:13.341
Yeah. Well, I bet he's quit chewing chaw
and joined the NAACP, too.

01:00:17.554 --> 01:00:19.513
Come on,
I can't believe you walked out here!

01:00:19.598 --> 01:00:20.682
Well...

01:00:21.641 --> 01:00:23.602
I didn't wanna bother you guys.

01:00:23.685 --> 01:00:24.978
It's, uh...

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:35.113
That's the last thing that she said.

01:00:37.949 --> 01:00:39.158
Boy!

01:00:39.242 --> 01:00:41.285
Oh, Lord!

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:42.829
Oh, boy.

01:00:42.912 --> 01:00:46.040
So, what's it like being a big war hero?

01:00:46.124 --> 01:00:49.502
- Shit, I wouldn't know.
- No, don't give me that.

01:00:49.586 --> 01:00:51.838
Army wrote me letters
about your fancy medals.

01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:55.383
Said it was the highest honor
an airman could achieve.

01:00:57.135 --> 01:00:58.720
- They did?
- Well...

01:00:59.679 --> 01:01:01.139
I was lucky.

01:01:02.223 --> 01:01:04.768
- Other men weren't.
- Yeah. Well...

01:01:04.851 --> 01:01:07.771
I bet you got plenty of tail
out if it, too.

01:01:07.854 --> 01:01:10.690
Oh, Jamie never needed medals
to get girls, Pappy.

01:01:10.774 --> 01:01:11.858
Mmm?

01:01:11.941 --> 01:01:14.110
- Take after me that way.
- Hmm.

01:01:14.193 --> 01:01:17.446
Your mama was the prettiest girl
in Greenville.

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:20.825
And I had 'em all sniffing up after me.

01:01:23.202 --> 01:01:25.872
Yeah. I'll tell you one thing for sure.

01:01:27.206 --> 01:01:32.128
You had to kill a whole lot of Krauts
to get them medals.

01:01:32.211 --> 01:01:35.632
How many did you take out, you reckon?
Fifty? Fifty? A hundred?

01:01:35.715 --> 01:01:38.342
- Oh, I don't know.
- Well, take a guess.

01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:41.262
I don't know.

01:01:41.846 --> 01:01:43.807
What... What's the matter?

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:46.600
Man ought to know
how many men he's killed.

01:01:51.522 --> 01:01:52.522
Well...

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.860
I'll tell you one thing.

01:02:01.991 --> 01:02:03.910
It was more than one.

01:02:12.585 --> 01:02:13.795
Well, son...

01:02:15.588 --> 01:02:20.009
at least I looked my one in the eye
before I shot him.

01:02:22.636 --> 01:02:25.932
Not like dropping bombs
from a mile up in the air.

01:02:30.687 --> 01:02:31.688
Pappy.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.607
- Pappy, come on.
- To hell with him.

01:02:35.692 --> 01:02:38.361
Why'd you have to go and do that?
Hmm?

01:02:40.113 --> 01:02:41.530
He's just proud of you.

01:02:43.199 --> 01:02:44.658
- That's all.
- Mmm.

01:02:46.786 --> 01:02:48.913
- Yeah.
- Got a point, though.

01:02:48.997 --> 01:02:50.498
We should hit the hay.

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:52.917
You'll be okay on the couch?

01:02:54.085 --> 01:02:55.169
Yeah.

01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:59.673
Come on.

01:03:05.346 --> 01:03:07.306
Good to see you, little brother.

01:03:08.725 --> 01:03:10.977
Appreciate you and Laura for having me.

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:13.104
Okay.

01:03:14.438 --> 01:03:15.689
You need a good night's sleep.

01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:20.737
Feed you up. Get some meat on those bones.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.238
Actually, it was more like four.

01:03:23.948 --> 01:03:25.074
Four what?

01:03:26.617 --> 01:03:30.579
Miles up in the air.
The altitude we dropped those bombs from.

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:33.583
The hell you even see anything
that high up?

01:03:34.542 --> 01:03:36.085
You'd be surprised.

01:03:36.836 --> 01:03:38.838
Roads, cities, factories.

01:03:40.381 --> 01:03:41.800
Just not people.

01:03:44.552 --> 01:03:47.096
20,000 feet, they ain't even ants.

01:03:51.768 --> 01:03:53.186
Pappy's right.

01:03:55.396 --> 01:03:56.898
Man ought to know.

01:04:02.611 --> 01:04:03.822
Good night.

01:04:27.804 --> 01:04:30.639
Home again, home again. Jiggity-jig.

01:04:35.854 --> 01:04:39.899
Tupelo! Next stop, Tupelo!

01:04:45.613 --> 01:04:49.450
Coon, spade, darky, nigger.

01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:52.286
Went off to fight for my country

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:54.705
to come back
and find it hadn't changed a bit.

01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:09.428
Thank you.

01:05:17.186 --> 01:05:18.562
Howdy, Miss Tricklebank.

01:05:18.646 --> 01:05:21.482
Ronsel... is that you?

01:05:21.565 --> 01:05:23.317
Yes, ma'am, it is, last time I checked.

01:05:23.401 --> 01:05:25.987
Oh, I declare, aren't you grown up!
How are ya?

01:05:26.070 --> 01:05:28.364
I am mighty fine. How've you been?

01:05:28.447 --> 01:05:31.159
Oh, I'm getting' along fine.
I'm getting along fine.

01:05:31.242 --> 01:05:32.285
You seen your folks yet?

01:05:32.368 --> 01:05:36.455
No, I just wanted to stop by and get 'em
a couple of things before I went home.

01:05:37.123 --> 01:05:41.127
Hello, Ronsel. I'm Mrs. McAllan.
Your parents work on our farm.

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:42.211
How you do, ma'am?

01:05:42.295 --> 01:05:44.422
Your mother talks about you
all the time.

01:05:44.505 --> 01:05:46.465
I know they'll be mighty glad to see you.

01:05:47.091 --> 01:05:48.176
Is that everything?

01:05:48.259 --> 01:05:55.141
Oh, no. Uh, I just needed to get
some sugar and some candy.

01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:56.642
Sugar and candy?

01:05:56.725 --> 01:06:00.646
Yes. The sugar's for my mama,
and the candy's for Marlon and Lilly May.

01:06:00.729 --> 01:06:02.690
Figured I'd spoil 'em a little bit.

01:06:02.773 --> 01:06:05.776
- Sergeant's pay.
- I'm sure they'll appreciate that.

01:06:05.859 --> 01:06:06.945
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:08.946 --> 01:06:11.115
You have a great day. Mrs. McAllan.

01:06:14.243 --> 01:06:17.705
Look what we got here. A jig in a uniform.

01:06:20.374 --> 01:06:22.126
Where do you think you're goin', boy?

01:06:22.919 --> 01:06:25.713
I beg your pardon, sir. I'm just tryin'
to get home to see my folks.

01:06:25.796 --> 01:06:28.077
- Not that way you ain't.
- Pappy, this is Ronsel.

01:06:28.591 --> 01:06:30.843
Hap and Florence's son.
Just returned from overseas.

01:06:30.927 --> 01:06:32.345
Oh, oh!

01:06:32.428 --> 01:06:36.182
Well, that explains why you're tryin'
to leave by the front door.

01:06:36.265 --> 01:06:39.268
You must be confused
as to your whereabouts.

01:06:39.352 --> 01:06:43.106
- No, sir, I'm not confused at all.
- Oh, I think you are, boy.

01:06:43.689 --> 01:06:46.109
I don't know
what they let you do over there,

01:06:46.192 --> 01:06:48.778
but you're in Mississippi now, nigger.

01:06:49.445 --> 01:06:51.197
You use the back door.

01:06:54.408 --> 01:06:58.162
Go on, son.
Son, we don't want no trouble here. Go on.

01:06:58.746 --> 01:06:59.956
Go on.

01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:03.001
You know what? You're absolutely right.

01:07:03.084 --> 01:07:07.005
When we was overseas,
they didn't make us use the back door.

01:07:07.088 --> 01:07:09.882
General Patton put us on the front line.

01:07:10.508 --> 01:07:13.052
Yes, sir. You know what we did?

01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:17.515
We kicked the hell out of Hitler
and them Jerries.

01:07:19.767 --> 01:07:22.020
While y'all at home safe and sound.

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.527
Henry, I'm almost done here.

01:07:34.573 --> 01:07:36.575
Home again, home again.

01:07:40.371 --> 01:07:43.541
Bless us, O Lord, and these
thy gifts which we are about to receive

01:07:43.624 --> 01:07:46.252
from thy bounty through Christ,
our Lord and savior.

01:07:46.335 --> 01:07:49.380
And, Lord,
thank you for the sun you've been sending

01:07:49.463 --> 01:07:52.508
to make the cotton grow,
and for the health of all here present.

01:07:53.217 --> 01:07:57.513
And, Lord Jesus,
please watch over my boy Ronsel,

01:07:57.596 --> 01:07:59.973
wherever in creation he may be.

01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:02.393
Amen.

01:08:04.270 --> 01:08:05.270
Ronsel!

01:08:07.023 --> 01:08:09.317
Hey, hey, hey.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.819
Oh, my baby!

01:08:15.031 --> 01:08:17.075
Oh, look at you. You're so grown.

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:19.910
- Handsome, too.
- Lilly May! Hey.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.081
Oh, Marlon, look at you.
You about my size. You shot up, huh?

01:08:24.915 --> 01:08:26.750
- What'd you get them medals for?
- How was the trip home?

01:08:26.834 --> 01:08:27.993
For killing Germans?

01:08:28.044 --> 01:08:31.044
- Why you ain't tell us you was coming?
- Quit fussing over him now...

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.756
and let him come say hello to his father.

01:08:54.987 --> 01:08:57.865
I knew you'd come. I prayed for it.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.245
Thank you, God. Look at you.

01:09:03.287 --> 01:09:04.287
Look at you.

01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:18.969
What in the devil happened to you?

01:09:21.846 --> 01:09:23.807
Mom, I brought you some groceries.

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:25.143
Oh, thank you, baby.

01:09:28.854 --> 01:09:30.063
Come on, sit down.

01:09:30.898 --> 01:09:33.859
Providence.

01:09:33.942 --> 01:09:35.778
- Want some rice?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:35.861 --> 01:09:37.863
- Thank you, God.
- Amen.

01:09:50.584 --> 01:09:52.670
I ain't never known you
to smoke, son.

01:09:55.756 --> 01:09:57.591
Well, a lot's changed, Pop.

01:10:00.386 --> 01:10:02.066
You sure you get enough to eat?

01:10:02.513 --> 01:10:03.514
Yes.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.019
I'm stuffed. I used to be dreamin'
about them biscuits, too.

01:10:09.102 --> 01:10:10.979
Yeah, I dreamt about you, too.

01:10:14.942 --> 01:10:16.026
What'd you see?

01:10:18.571 --> 01:10:21.323
You back with us now, safe and sound.

01:10:22.074 --> 01:10:23.909
Be nice to have
another pair of hands.

01:10:24.493 --> 01:10:27.705
With you home, we might can make up
what we lost after my accident.

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:31.417
Pay off the lien, get a new contract,
go back to being tenants next year.

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.045
Maybe he got plans of his own.
Let him follow his own mind, Hap.

01:10:35.128 --> 01:10:36.297
No, no, Mama.

01:10:38.257 --> 01:10:40.343
Yes, of course, I'll stay.

01:10:41.385 --> 01:10:42.470
Of course.

01:10:44.388 --> 01:10:48.434
Give me time to figure things out
and put this war behind me.

01:10:57.485 --> 01:10:59.152
What's he want now?

01:11:07.536 --> 01:11:08.996
Evening, Mr. McAllan.

01:11:09.079 --> 01:11:11.915
Evening, Hap. Florence.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:15.878
This our son Ronsel I told you about.

01:11:15.961 --> 01:11:17.338
Yeah, we already met.

01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:21.884
- Hap, I'd better speak to you alone.
- Huh.

01:11:23.719 --> 01:11:25.012
I'm not a child, sir.

01:11:26.013 --> 01:11:28.807
Anything you can say to my daddy,
you can say in front of me.

01:11:31.352 --> 01:11:35.189
All right, then. You're asking for
a whole heap of trouble...

01:11:35.773 --> 01:11:38.609
acting the way you did
at Tricklebank's earlier.

01:11:39.985 --> 01:11:42.112
Now, I know
you don't want that kinda trouble.

01:11:42.863 --> 01:11:46.074
Not for yourself, or for your family.

01:11:46.158 --> 01:11:47.785
Boy, what'd you do?

01:11:48.869 --> 01:11:50.246
He couldn't have done anything.

01:11:50.329 --> 01:11:53.957
- I just tried to walk out the door is all.
- The front door.

01:11:56.585 --> 01:11:59.046
When my father and another man
corrected him, he gave a fine speech.

01:11:59.129 --> 01:12:01.173
Put us all in our places, didn't you?

01:12:04.217 --> 01:12:05.469
Is that true?

01:12:09.682 --> 01:12:11.809
Then I reckon you best apologize.

01:12:14.978 --> 01:12:16.439
I'm sorry, sir.

01:12:27.741 --> 01:12:28.741
All right.

01:12:30.744 --> 01:12:32.413
My father's gonna want an apology, too.

01:12:32.496 --> 01:12:34.832
Ronsel will pay him a visit
after church tomorrow, sir.

01:12:35.374 --> 01:12:36.583
Won't you, son?

01:12:37.125 --> 01:12:38.336
Yes, sir.

01:12:42.465 --> 01:12:44.633
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, sir.

01:12:44.717 --> 01:12:46.051
You have a good night.

01:12:52.391 --> 01:12:56.186
No point in fightin'.
They just gonna win every time.

01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:04.528
Just not used to walking away
from a fight, Daddy, that's all.

01:13:06.364 --> 01:13:07.740
Not no more.

01:13:14.872 --> 01:13:16.624
How long you been back?

01:13:16.707 --> 01:13:18.417
Oh, just couple of weeks.

01:13:18.501 --> 01:13:20.503
Mm-hmm. And how are you liking Marietta?

01:13:20.586 --> 01:13:22.963
Oh, it's a lovely little town.
Just lovely.

01:13:23.881 --> 01:13:27.009
Oh, I got that one right there.
Put that there.

01:13:27.092 --> 01:13:29.762
Much obliged, Miss Tricklebank.
You have yourself a wonderful day.

01:13:29.845 --> 01:13:30.846
- Take care.
- Yeah.

01:13:35.393 --> 01:13:36.393
Look at that.

01:13:36.435 --> 01:13:38.270
- What's that about?
- What's wrong with him?

01:13:41.482 --> 01:13:43.692
He must've just come back from the war.

01:13:52.743 --> 01:13:53.743
It's all right.

01:13:54.495 --> 01:13:57.873
It's just a car. It must've backfired.
Stuck intake valve.

01:14:13.055 --> 01:14:14.807
They say it stops eventually.

01:14:20.396 --> 01:14:22.690
You're Ronsel. Hap's son.

01:14:24.525 --> 01:14:26.193
Jamie McAllan. Henry's Brother.

01:14:27.069 --> 01:14:28.404
Pleasure to meet you.

01:14:33.158 --> 01:14:34.158
You walk here?

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:35.911
Yes.

01:14:36.328 --> 01:14:37.621
Let me give you a lift.

01:14:39.873 --> 01:14:40.999
Come on.

01:15:12.865 --> 01:15:14.865
This is Bob Dunning
with the highlights

01:15:14.908 --> 01:15:16.785
for the 15th Annual All-Star Game.

01:15:17.828 --> 01:15:20.998
- Come on up front!
- I'm fine right where I am.

01:15:21.749 --> 01:15:23.709
Get in, soldier. That's an order.

01:15:23.792 --> 01:15:25.711
In the National League, heavy artillery.

01:15:25.794 --> 01:15:29.089
John Mize, Walker Cooper,
Ralph Kiner and Stan Musial.

01:15:30.298 --> 01:15:32.843
The American League pioneers,

01:15:32.926 --> 01:15:35.971
Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio,
George Kell and Lou Boudreau.

01:15:40.058 --> 01:15:43.020
- How'd you know you outrank me?
- I was a captain.

01:15:44.354 --> 01:15:47.024
They got Negro captains.
I served under plenty of 'em.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.405
Well, you obeyed my order.
I bet you was a sergeant.

01:15:54.364 --> 01:15:56.408
761st Tank Battalion.

01:15:57.701 --> 01:15:58.952
"Come Out Fighting."

01:16:01.371 --> 01:16:03.415
We spearheaded for General Patton.

01:16:04.875 --> 01:16:06.084
You?

01:16:07.377 --> 01:16:09.087
I flew B-25s.

01:16:10.255 --> 01:16:12.925
So, Sergeant, how do you like
being back here in the delta?

01:16:19.973 --> 01:16:21.517
Yeah, me, too.

01:16:22.475 --> 01:16:25.145
- Heard you and my pappy had some words.
- I apologized for that.

01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:28.273
He's a disagreeable son of a bitch.
I'm sure he had it coming.

01:16:30.901 --> 01:16:33.987
- Here's to you.
- I'm fine, thank you.

01:16:34.822 --> 01:16:36.114
Boy, you always this stubborn,

01:16:36.198 --> 01:16:38.701
or just around white people
tryin' to be nice?

01:16:42.746 --> 01:16:43.831
Go on.

01:16:51.296 --> 01:16:53.757
Now, what kind of NCO are you?

01:16:59.721 --> 01:17:03.183
Now, don't waste it, now.
That's my medicine.

01:17:03.642 --> 01:17:04.643
I need every drop.

01:17:10.065 --> 01:17:12.610
You tanker boys ever piss in your helmets?

01:17:14.903 --> 01:17:18.240
- Plenty of times.
- We had a relief tube up in the cockpit.

01:17:19.032 --> 01:17:22.077
Sometimes it was easier just to go
in our flak helmets.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.246
But at 20,000 feet,

01:17:24.329 --> 01:17:26.832
that piss freezes solid
in less than a minute.

01:17:29.001 --> 01:17:30.711
It's that cold up there?

01:17:31.378 --> 01:17:34.757
Shit. I'm talking 20, 30 below.

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:36.592
One time we were on this long haul,

01:17:36.675 --> 01:17:39.261
I pissed in my helmet,
I forgot all about it.

01:17:39.344 --> 01:17:42.723
We were just over the target.
I put the helmet back on.

01:17:42.806 --> 01:17:45.058
We're doing this bombing run,
dodgin' enemy flak,

01:17:45.142 --> 01:17:49.146
and all of a sudden, I started feelin'
something runnin' down my face.

01:17:49.229 --> 01:17:51.273
Yeah, I thought I was hit.

01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:54.610
I smelled like a damn latrine.

01:17:56.612 --> 01:17:59.740
Yeah, you must've caught hell
back at that officer's club, too.

01:17:59.823 --> 01:18:02.034
Boy, my friends never let me hear
the end of it.

01:18:02.993 --> 01:18:05.120
The ones that made it back, anyway.

01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:10.458
Yeah, I lost some friends, too.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:14.504
Well, here's to them.

01:18:25.766 --> 01:18:29.602
"I wouldn't get home until..."

01:18:42.365 --> 01:18:45.869
- Everythin' all right, Mr. Jamie?
- Oh, everything's just fine.

01:18:45.953 --> 01:18:48.706
Just gave Ronsel here a little lift
from town.

01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:53.919
I'll be heading back to town
next Saturday afternoon.

01:18:54.002 --> 01:18:56.546
If you like, I'll stop by here
and see if you want a ride.

01:18:57.673 --> 01:18:58.924
That'd be fine.

01:19:00.133 --> 01:19:01.133
Well, all right.

01:19:02.052 --> 01:19:03.136
Hap.

01:19:42.342 --> 01:19:45.303
Oh!

01:19:46.722 --> 01:19:48.598
Oh, Lord.

01:20:00.568 --> 01:20:02.070
I got you somethin', Mom.

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:04.531
Oh.

01:20:06.449 --> 01:20:07.993
This is so much.

01:20:09.036 --> 01:20:11.204
I'll save it for your brother and sister.
They'll love it.

01:20:11.288 --> 01:20:12.288
No.

01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:15.500
- I got it for you.
- Oh, baby, I can't.

01:20:16.877 --> 01:20:18.461
I'm gonna watch you eat it.

01:20:27.512 --> 01:20:28.513
Hmm.

01:20:31.558 --> 01:20:32.893
Mm-hmm.

01:20:36.188 --> 01:20:37.397
Thank you, son.

01:20:39.732 --> 01:20:42.778
Finish it, Mom. Don't save it.
Don't save it, Mom.

01:20:44.612 --> 01:20:47.407
I better not see Lilly May or Marlon
with none of that.

01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:48.741
All right.

01:20:52.162 --> 01:20:53.580
I love you.

01:20:53.663 --> 01:20:55.165
I love you, too, sweetie.

01:20:58.877 --> 01:20:59.920
Thank you.

01:21:00.963 --> 01:21:02.172
I can't...

01:21:06.718 --> 01:21:07.718
I tried.

01:21:09.805 --> 01:21:13.600
I'm sorry.

01:21:17.062 --> 01:21:18.355
I can't...

01:21:19.982 --> 01:21:21.441
I can't swim.

01:21:23.735 --> 01:21:24.945
Oh, God.

01:21:27.364 --> 01:21:28.866
Oh, God.

01:21:30.408 --> 01:21:31.869
Oh, my God.

01:21:33.578 --> 01:21:37.332
Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Jamie.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:21:37.415 --> 01:21:42.546
It's me. It's me. It's okay. It's okay.

01:21:46.758 --> 01:21:48.760
It's okay. Come here, come here.

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.101
No.

01:21:57.519 --> 01:21:59.563
No, I can't.

01:22:00.313 --> 01:22:01.606
- Jamie.
- I gotta go.

01:22:17.873 --> 01:22:20.750
As usual,
when anything bad happened,

01:22:20.833 --> 01:22:22.294
Henry was away.

01:22:23.962 --> 01:22:28.049
He and Pappy had gone to see about
some hogs, so I was alone with the girls.

01:22:40.061 --> 01:22:41.061
Vera?

01:22:43.315 --> 01:22:45.025
You need to take me to town.

01:22:46.443 --> 01:22:48.361
I'm gonna kill Carl.

01:22:51.448 --> 01:22:53.825
Vera, why don't you come
and sit down and we'll talk...

01:22:53.909 --> 01:22:56.119
I don't have time to sit down.

01:22:56.912 --> 01:22:58.746
He's with her now.

01:22:59.205 --> 01:23:01.875
Started in on Alma, just like with Renie.

01:23:02.667 --> 01:23:04.836
Amanda Leigh,
take your sister into the house.

01:23:05.795 --> 01:23:09.091
Amanda, go on. Go on 'round the back, go.

01:23:12.177 --> 01:23:15.472
- Vera?
- You gotta take me to town now.

01:23:18.683 --> 01:23:20.393
- I can't drive.
- I seen you drivin'...

01:23:20.477 --> 01:23:23.647
And I got in trouble for it.
My husband took the keys away.

01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:28.360
Come on.

01:23:50.298 --> 01:23:54.261
They found Carl's body
laying in the road halfway to town.

01:23:56.388 --> 01:24:00.016
Florence said she'd seen her walking
down Main Street covered in blood.

01:24:02.185 --> 01:24:04.854
She said it looked like
she'd bathed in it.

01:24:07.399 --> 01:24:09.901
Vera had stabbed him 17 times.

01:24:11.194 --> 01:24:13.946
But I didn't find out those details
till later.

01:24:16.158 --> 01:24:18.410
I was too lost in my own misery.

01:24:30.963 --> 01:24:32.715
What's wrong, Mama?

01:24:32.799 --> 01:24:35.552
Amanda Leigh, I need you to be a big girl
and go and get Florence.

01:24:36.094 --> 01:24:39.264
You remember how to get there?
Good girl, run as fast as you can.

01:24:43.185 --> 01:24:45.062
No!

01:24:46.604 --> 01:24:48.065
No!

01:25:29.856 --> 01:25:31.983
I lost one of my babies once, too.

01:25:36.571 --> 01:25:38.198
His name was Samuel.

01:26:13.024 --> 01:26:15.151
I used to come here all the time
when I was a boy.

01:26:16.778 --> 01:26:20.615
Just when I needed to be alone
and clear my mind.

01:26:21.407 --> 01:26:23.284
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

01:26:30.583 --> 01:26:31.793
Here.

01:26:35.922 --> 01:26:37.632
Why are you being so nice to me?

01:26:38.258 --> 01:26:40.593
You look like you could use it.

01:26:52.897 --> 01:26:54.316
Bullshit.

01:27:06.453 --> 01:27:08.663
We were somewhere over Austria.

01:27:09.789 --> 01:27:12.917
We made contact
with a whole swarm of Messerschmitts.

01:27:14.336 --> 01:27:16.754
I mean, they was everywhere.

01:27:19.174 --> 01:27:21.884
Took out my tail gun, co-pilot...

01:27:23.928 --> 01:27:26.389
Made a deal with God right there.

01:27:26.473 --> 01:27:29.226
Swore if he saved me,
I was gonna do somethin' good.

01:27:32.729 --> 01:27:34.981
I don't know what that was, but...

01:27:36.441 --> 01:27:38.276
I promised anyway.

01:27:42.739 --> 01:27:46.451
Before you know,
whole bunch of P-51s show up...

01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:49.412
just like goddamn cavalry.

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.416
They cleared those Germans
right out of the sky.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:59.088
And I swear, they were angels sent
by the Lord himself.

01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:06.137
Those P-51s, their tails was painted red.

01:28:07.305 --> 01:28:09.599
One of 'em buzzed me
right after the flight.

01:28:10.516 --> 01:28:12.894
I looked over.
I thought I was seeing things.

01:28:13.978 --> 01:28:15.647
That fighter pilot...

01:28:18.191 --> 01:28:19.442
he was colored.

01:28:23.905 --> 01:28:25.490
He saluted me...

01:28:28.535 --> 01:28:30.202
I saluted him back.

01:28:35.207 --> 01:28:39.546
Men that died that day...
they were husbands, fathers.

01:28:40.672 --> 01:28:42.006
They were good men.

01:28:43.967 --> 01:28:45.385
A lot better than me.

01:29:12.329 --> 01:29:13.705
Oh, well.

01:29:56.205 --> 01:29:58.916
We brought this for you, Mama.

01:30:00.209 --> 01:30:03.588
This is for you, Mama.

01:30:04.547 --> 01:30:06.299
Now, you gotta...

01:30:07.467 --> 01:30:11.804
You can't have a shower
without the screen up.

01:30:12.472 --> 01:30:14.932
Now, where do we put that?

01:30:15.517 --> 01:30:18.395
What are you thinkin'?
Maybe here, in the water?

01:30:19.061 --> 01:30:23.357
Now you gotta help me figure out
where to put this.

01:30:23.441 --> 01:30:26.611
What do you think? In there?
You can smell it.

01:30:26.694 --> 01:30:30.031
Mommy,
Uncle Jamie's building you a shower.

01:30:30.114 --> 01:30:31.658
You little angel.

01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:33.993
You were supposed to tell me
if she was gonna be comin'.

01:30:38.831 --> 01:30:40.792
Thought you might want a little privacy...

01:30:41.668 --> 01:30:44.253
every now and then,
if you were havin' a bath.

01:30:45.797 --> 01:30:47.339
What you think?

01:30:51.302 --> 01:30:52.887
I think it's marvelous.

01:30:54.221 --> 01:30:55.221
Thank you.

01:30:55.264 --> 01:30:56.264
Well...

01:31:00.687 --> 01:31:02.021
I'll fetch some water.

01:31:05.316 --> 01:31:06.734
They smell good, baby.

01:31:53.615 --> 01:31:57.827
He hardly eats... hardly sleeps.

01:31:58.870 --> 01:32:02.499
Can't sit still... can't move.

01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:05.668
It's like he's just stewing.

01:32:06.753 --> 01:32:08.170
Waiting for somethin'.

01:32:09.171 --> 01:32:11.841
Waiting for whatever didn't happen
to happen.

01:32:13.801 --> 01:32:17.388
Come on!
This bottle ain't gonna drink itself.

01:32:18.681 --> 01:32:19.682
Whoo-hoo!

01:32:20.892 --> 01:32:22.434
Already losing daylight!

01:32:22.518 --> 01:32:26.355
Hold your horses. How you doin'?

01:32:27.982 --> 01:32:31.027
I'd be happy to see me, too.

01:33:02.391 --> 01:33:03.976
Woman, you ain't tired?

01:33:04.769 --> 01:33:07.855
- We gotta let him go.
- We ain't holdin' him.

01:33:07.939 --> 01:33:10.399
He's staying for us. I know he is.

01:33:11.025 --> 01:33:12.484
Well, what if he wants to stay?

01:33:14.946 --> 01:33:17.073
It's not always gonna be like this.

01:33:20.367 --> 01:33:21.911
Soon as I'm healed...

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.997
we'll move out of here.

01:33:26.165 --> 01:33:27.333
We'll be okay.

01:33:28.668 --> 01:33:31.754
He'll be okay once he has his own place.

01:33:31.837 --> 01:33:33.047
We'll be okay?

01:33:33.547 --> 01:33:35.758
I guarantee it.

01:33:54.276 --> 01:33:55.612
Remember that?

01:33:55.695 --> 01:33:58.865
Yes, I do.

01:33:59.824 --> 01:34:03.953
You know what? You ain't supposed to be up
on that broke leg all the time, Jackson.

01:34:05.246 --> 01:34:07.623
If you don't let it heal,
you ain't never gonna walk.

01:34:08.499 --> 01:34:10.585
Why walk if I can't dance?

01:34:11.335 --> 01:34:13.420
Lovely woman, you are.

01:34:35.693 --> 01:34:36.944
Silver Star?

01:34:37.904 --> 01:34:39.196
- Yeah.
- Damn.

01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:42.116
Don't be impressed.
I got it for being stupid.

01:34:42.199 --> 01:34:44.368
What?

01:34:46.037 --> 01:34:48.289
You ever miss it sometimes?
Being over there.

01:34:50.166 --> 01:34:53.836
I don't mean being shot at,
but sometimes, I actually miss it.

01:34:58.549 --> 01:34:59.717
Yeah, me, too.

01:35:03.262 --> 01:35:05.181
Over there, I was a liberator.

01:35:07.725 --> 01:35:10.394
People lined up in the streets
waiting for us.

01:35:11.771 --> 01:35:13.690
Throwing flowers and cheering.

01:35:17.068 --> 01:35:19.654
And here,
I'm just another nigger pushing a plow.

01:35:23.074 --> 01:35:24.658
Some of the men, too.

01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:30.623
- Yeah, I think about 'em every day.
- Seeing different parts of the world.

01:35:31.498 --> 01:35:34.335
Italian girls, English girls...

01:35:37.254 --> 01:35:41.425
Some of those hairy Greek girls
with those big old hairy muffs...

01:35:41.508 --> 01:35:46.013
Yeah, it was somethin' else.
It was somethin', man.

01:35:50.309 --> 01:35:52.269
You ever been with a white girl?

01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:08.953
Shit, well... I'll be damned. Huh?

01:36:09.703 --> 01:36:11.831
Oh, yeah? Tell me.

01:36:14.541 --> 01:36:19.005
Army gave us separate barracks,

01:36:19.088 --> 01:36:23.092
separate blood supply, separate latrines.

01:36:28.722 --> 01:36:31.768
But them European girls
didn't have a problem with us at all.

01:36:34.186 --> 01:36:36.063
One day, we were up in Wimborne,

01:36:36.147 --> 01:36:38.983
old English girl walked past
and slapped me right on my butt.

01:36:39.066 --> 01:36:40.484
Never laid eyes on her.

01:36:41.193 --> 01:36:46.490
Said the white GI's told her
that we was more monkey than human.

01:36:49.243 --> 01:36:50.702
And she was checking for a tail.

01:36:52.288 --> 01:36:54.498
I'm sorry to laugh.

01:36:55.374 --> 01:36:59.586
So every opportunity we got,
we showed 'em just how human we were.

01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:04.801
- Yep.
- German girls, too, huh?

01:37:07.178 --> 01:37:08.179
Mm-hmm.

01:37:10.514 --> 01:37:11.515
Uh-oh.

01:37:12.183 --> 01:37:14.518
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:37:14.601 --> 01:37:16.437
I seen that look before.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:17.729
Huh?

01:37:18.522 --> 01:37:20.482
She must have been somethin' special.

01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:34.621
But that was then, this is now,
and I guess I'm right where I should be.

01:37:35.414 --> 01:37:38.876
Yep. Right where I need to be.

01:37:48.469 --> 01:37:50.637
Throwing my life away.

01:38:24.171 --> 01:38:27.091
- I'll get you back safe, Rog.
- I'll hold you to that.

01:38:27.674 --> 01:38:29.969
We got some coming on the left!

01:38:30.052 --> 01:38:31.762
They took out the tail gunner!

01:38:32.805 --> 01:38:35.307
Roger, come on, talk to me!

01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:01.625
Oh, shit.

01:39:20.394 --> 01:39:22.479
We'll get it hauled out tomorrow, Henry.

01:39:35.159 --> 01:39:36.744
I'm sorry.

01:39:51.175 --> 01:39:53.760
Check? All right.

01:39:59.683 --> 01:40:01.769
It's half past nine.
You just now gettin' up?

01:40:05.314 --> 01:40:08.734
So I guess you gonna lay around all day
while your brothers and sisters work?

01:40:09.693 --> 01:40:10.694
Hmm?

01:40:10.777 --> 01:40:12.404
What's wrong with you, son?

01:40:14.115 --> 01:40:15.824
What's wrong with you, boy?

01:40:15.907 --> 01:40:18.827
Letter came for you.
Says it's all the way from Germany.

01:40:19.495 --> 01:40:20.746
Germany.

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:24.458
Who's, uh, Resl? Ress...

01:40:24.958 --> 01:40:27.003
Is that a man or a woman?

01:40:27.086 --> 01:40:30.839
How you... R-E-S-L. Ressil, Reecil...
How you pronounce that?

01:40:30.922 --> 01:40:32.258
Somebody that I knew.

01:40:34.176 --> 01:40:36.095
Where... Where you goin'?

01:40:36.178 --> 01:40:37.471
I'll be back!

01:40:37.554 --> 01:40:39.390
Ronsel!

01:41:00.911 --> 01:41:03.747
Oh, you think it's funny, do you?
Spilling good milk.

01:41:04.206 --> 01:41:07.501
Well, you know what they say.
"No use crying over it."

01:41:08.044 --> 01:41:11.213
Yeah, at least,
when it's somebody else's, that is.

01:41:11.297 --> 01:41:15.926
What do I... what do I owe you here,
like, a buck fifty? Maybe two?

01:41:16.009 --> 01:41:17.886
Let's just make it even.

01:41:17.969 --> 01:41:20.972
- I'm not talkin' about money!
- What do you want from me?

01:41:21.057 --> 01:41:22.724
What's the matter with you? Be a man!

01:41:22.808 --> 01:41:24.893
Oh, yeah? One pail of spilled milk
and I ain't a man?

01:41:24.977 --> 01:41:27.187
You sure as hell ain't actin' like it!

01:41:27.688 --> 01:41:30.357
You come and go as you please,
you disappear for days on end,

01:41:30.441 --> 01:41:32.318
and when you are here, you're drunk.

01:41:32.401 --> 01:41:34.320
I don't answer to you.

01:41:34.403 --> 01:41:36.988
When you're under my roof
and you work on my farm, you do.

01:41:37.073 --> 01:41:38.699
Oh, I'm sorry there, Mr. Boss Man.

01:41:38.782 --> 01:41:42.244
Ain't my fault your damn farmin' dreams
ain't working out.

01:41:42.994 --> 01:41:45.872
Ain't my fault that
your damn cotton fields are flooded out!

01:41:45.956 --> 01:41:49.210
You know your problem, Jamie?
You don't know your own worth, brother.

01:41:49.293 --> 01:41:51.879
You don't know what a man needs to know.
A man ought to know.

01:41:53.755 --> 01:41:56.383
- You better open your eyes, big brother.
- Open my eyes to what?

01:41:56.467 --> 01:41:58.094
You're so busy walkin' around here

01:41:58.177 --> 01:41:59.511
- like God Almighty...
- Huh?

01:41:59.595 --> 01:42:01.012
Worryin' about yourself and your farm,

01:42:01.097 --> 01:42:02.681
you can't even see
your own wife is miserable!

01:42:02.764 --> 01:42:04.124
Just watch your mouth.

01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:11.857
- Or what?
- Or what? Huh?

01:42:20.574 --> 01:42:24.620
- Yep. You know what, brother?
- Yeah?

01:42:24.703 --> 01:42:27.581
Fine, Jamie, go.
Be whatever kind of man you want to be.

01:42:27.998 --> 01:42:29.583
Just do it someplace else.

01:42:30.834 --> 01:42:34.087
- That's fine. I'll go to town.
- I'm not talkin' about town.

01:42:34.171 --> 01:42:37.799
I'm going to Greenville tomorrow
for a few days to see about livestock.

01:42:37.883 --> 01:42:40.219
I'll expect you gone when I get back.

01:43:04.576 --> 01:43:06.328
What's wrong with you?

01:43:19.299 --> 01:43:22.136
You should have seen the look
on your face.

01:43:22.845 --> 01:43:23.887
It ain't funny.

01:43:24.555 --> 01:43:27.015
Au contraire, my friend. It is indeed.

01:43:27.516 --> 01:43:29.142
You about crazy as hell.

01:43:29.685 --> 01:43:31.937
Well, I can't argue with that.

01:43:32.521 --> 01:43:35.399
What you...
What you doin' walking in the rain?

01:43:38.985 --> 01:43:40.737
It don't matter.

01:43:45.826 --> 01:43:46.906
What's the matter with you?

01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:53.417
What's the worst thing you ever did?

01:43:54.210 --> 01:43:56.212
Something bad.

01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:58.505
Real bad and you knew
it was gonna hurt someone...

01:44:01.008 --> 01:44:02.426
but you did it anyway.

01:44:12.644 --> 01:44:14.438
Leavin' this woman right here.

01:44:27.117 --> 01:44:28.285
Well, I'll be.

01:44:29.703 --> 01:44:32.038
Congratulations, you're a father.

01:44:35.166 --> 01:44:36.710
His name's Franz.

01:44:38.003 --> 01:44:39.713
Franz, that's a good name.

01:44:41.256 --> 01:44:42.591
What you gonna do now?

01:44:46.177 --> 01:44:49.556
- She wants me to come back to Germany.
- That's a long haul.

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.640
Yeah.

01:44:52.225 --> 01:44:53.394
Long way.

01:44:55.979 --> 01:44:58.440
So, what about you?
What's the worst thing you ever done?

01:45:01.192 --> 01:45:04.070
Who, me? I'm a saint.

01:45:06.490 --> 01:45:10.118
I bet. I bet.

01:45:36.395 --> 01:45:37.813
Shit, put your head down.

01:45:44.528 --> 01:45:46.279
You think they seen us?

01:45:46.363 --> 01:45:47.906
I don't know.

01:46:02.963 --> 01:46:04.298
Well, here we are.

01:46:06.883 --> 01:46:08.134
Yeah.

01:46:09.302 --> 01:46:10.971
Yeah, I'm leaving town soon.

01:46:12.306 --> 01:46:13.626
I wanted to say good luck to you.

01:46:15.684 --> 01:46:16.684
You've been a friend.

01:46:19.145 --> 01:46:20.772
I want you to know that.

01:46:23.317 --> 01:46:24.317
Yeah.

01:46:29.239 --> 01:46:30.907
You've been a friend, too.

01:46:33.494 --> 01:46:35.537
You might be one of the good ones.

01:46:43.670 --> 01:46:44.921
Take care.

01:47:00.062 --> 01:47:02.189
I hope you find your way to your boy.

01:47:06.860 --> 01:47:08.278
To your family.

01:47:17.746 --> 01:47:19.498
Take care of yourself, huh?

01:47:21.792 --> 01:47:22.793
You, too.

01:47:34.346 --> 01:47:35.346
Hey, Mama.

01:47:35.764 --> 01:47:38.016
- You hungry?
- No, I'm good.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.018
Where is everybody?

01:47:40.101 --> 01:47:42.438
Gone up to church. Late service.

01:47:47.984 --> 01:47:49.069
Hmm.

01:47:49.152 --> 01:47:50.529
Here.

01:48:00.038 --> 01:48:05.669
- And there he is, drunk again.
- Uncle Jamie!

01:48:05.752 --> 01:48:07.963
Hello there, dear family.

01:48:08.797 --> 01:48:10.924
Who the hell was that with you
in the truck?

01:48:11.007 --> 01:48:13.802
The one I seen you drivin'. Who was it?

01:48:15.053 --> 01:48:16.304
Ronsel Jackson. What's it to you?

01:48:16.388 --> 01:48:20.392
You wanna tell me why that nigger
was ridin' upside you in the truck

01:48:20.475 --> 01:48:21.977
like two peas in a pod?

01:48:23.228 --> 01:48:25.856
He can ride wherever I say. Anything else?

01:48:25.939 --> 01:48:29.818
You. You son of a bitch.

01:48:34.823 --> 01:48:38.076
- You ain't worth a damn, you know that?
- Yeah, I know that.

01:48:38.159 --> 01:48:40.996
Mr. Big, Big War Hero, is ya?

01:48:41.079 --> 01:48:44.457
You're nothin' but a damn drunk!
Give me them keys.

01:48:45.291 --> 01:48:46.668
Just go.

01:48:47.461 --> 01:48:49.880
Oh, you want him all to yourself,
huh, gal?

01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:52.674
Too bad he's all liquored up.
He can't do you any good.

01:48:52.758 --> 01:48:55.135
- I beg your pardon?
- I seen you sniffin' after him.

01:48:55.218 --> 01:48:59.473
- Pappy.
- Maybe Henry is too thick to notice,

01:48:59.556 --> 01:49:00.556
but I ain't.

01:49:44.267 --> 01:49:47.353
- You seen the letter, Mama?
- The one from Germany?

01:49:47.437 --> 01:49:49.773
Oh, God, okay. All right. Hold on.

01:49:49.856 --> 01:49:52.609
Don't fret. Just wait
till your father come back, okay?

01:49:52.693 --> 01:49:55.236
Ronsel? Ronsel!

01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:00.950
Hi, there.

01:50:01.451 --> 01:50:05.330
- You'll be here for supper tonight?
- Uh, no.

01:50:08.124 --> 01:50:09.585
You goin' someplace?

01:50:10.501 --> 01:50:13.046
Yeah. Might, uh, head out west.

01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:15.757
Got a war buddy who lives in Los Angeles.

01:50:15.841 --> 01:50:19.510
Los Angeles?
Jamie, what are you talking about?

01:50:20.136 --> 01:50:22.973
- He didn't tell you?
- Who didn't tell me what?

01:50:23.682 --> 01:50:24.682
Henry.

01:50:25.684 --> 01:50:27.102
Told me to leave.

01:50:28.979 --> 01:50:31.690
- Probably for the best.
- So just like that, you up and leave?

01:50:32.398 --> 01:50:34.610
Were you even plannin' on sayin' goodbye?

01:50:36.527 --> 01:50:40.490
'Course. First bus don't leave till 2:00.

01:50:40.574 --> 01:50:43.326
What about the girls?
This will break their hearts.

01:50:44.202 --> 01:50:45.871
Laura, I can't stay here.

01:50:46.872 --> 01:50:47.872
I don't...

01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:53.795
You don't need to go, Jamie.

01:51:54.522 --> 01:51:56.900
- Whoo! Come here!
- Get him!

01:52:01.571 --> 01:52:03.651
- Come here, boy!
- Get him! Get him!

01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:06.409
Get him! Get him!

01:52:11.581 --> 01:52:13.166
Hold him down, boys!

01:52:17.253 --> 01:52:20.090
- Yeah, punch that nigger!
- Hit that nigger!

01:52:24.302 --> 01:52:25.762
- Get him up.
- Come on.

01:52:41.069 --> 01:52:43.363
Put your shoes on. Come with us.

01:53:05.135 --> 01:53:08.138
- Good Lord. You turn him loose.
- Shut up!

01:53:08.221 --> 01:53:10.515
Like hell, I will!
You turn him loose, damn it!

01:53:10.598 --> 01:53:12.017
- You best listen, son.
- I ain't your son!

01:53:13.059 --> 01:53:17.063
Now I suggest you use that thing,
or you better point elsewhere.

01:53:17.147 --> 01:53:18.731
Otherwise, you better kill us both.

01:53:18.815 --> 01:53:23.236
You betray your own blood
for the sake of a nigger?

01:53:23.319 --> 01:53:24.320
You do it.

01:53:24.404 --> 01:53:25.321
Come on!

01:53:25.405 --> 01:53:28.283
- Go on. You do it.
- Bring forth the evidence.

01:53:29.367 --> 01:53:31.411
- He's guilty!
- Kill him!

01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:35.915
Did you rut with this woman?

01:53:35.999 --> 01:53:39.002
What the hell do you fellas care
about some Kraut whore anyway?

01:53:39.502 --> 01:53:42.798
All those Fräulein cunts
got a lot of our boys killed.

01:53:42.881 --> 01:53:44.007
I say if Ronsel here

01:53:44.090 --> 01:53:47.803
gave her a little half-breed bundle of joy
to remind her of it, I call it justice!

01:53:47.886 --> 01:53:49.429
Shut up, nigger lover!

01:53:49.512 --> 01:53:52.140
How the hell do you know
that Ronsel here's the father anyway?

01:53:52.223 --> 01:53:54.767
Let's ask him.
Are you the father of this...

01:53:54.851 --> 01:53:57.479
I ain't gonna say "child..."
This abomination?

01:54:02.067 --> 01:54:04.152
Go on! Say it!

01:54:09.574 --> 01:54:11.659
- Yes.
- He said it!

01:54:11.742 --> 01:54:14.245
The penalty for abomination is death.

01:54:17.123 --> 01:54:18.291
Huh?

01:54:21.294 --> 01:54:22.628
Pappy?

01:54:24.089 --> 01:54:25.090
Huh?

01:54:26.757 --> 01:54:28.885
No.

01:54:30.261 --> 01:54:31.804
He ain't gonna shoot.

01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:39.855
You don't have the balls
to kill a man up close, do you, son?

01:54:41.106 --> 01:54:43.108
Unh-unh.

01:54:44.692 --> 01:54:47.028
You ain't gonna kill your own Pappy.

01:55:16.391 --> 01:55:20.145
You make one more wrong move,
these boys are liable to kill you.

01:55:21.521 --> 01:55:22.813
What we gonna do with him?

01:55:22.897 --> 01:55:26.734
I already told you, he won't talk.
Ain't that right, son?

01:55:27.568 --> 01:55:29.237
You set him loose.

01:55:30.821 --> 01:55:34.034
You ain't exactly in a position
to be making demands.

01:55:35.243 --> 01:55:37.412
Nigger still needs to be punished.

01:55:39.330 --> 01:55:42.125
You let my son there decide how.

01:55:43.418 --> 01:55:44.878
All right, then.

01:55:46.254 --> 01:55:48.590
What'll it be?

01:55:48.923 --> 01:55:51.217
I'll give you a choice.

01:55:52.177 --> 01:55:56.472
You don't want him killed,
then you decide the punishment.

01:55:56.848 --> 01:55:58.057
No!

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:03.021
His tongue, his eyes, or his balls?

01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:05.773
Choose.

01:56:12.405 --> 01:56:14.490
Choose, God damn it!

01:56:26.252 --> 01:56:28.046
His tongue.

01:57:02.247 --> 01:57:04.415
- Hold him up.
- Get the ladder!

01:57:06.417 --> 01:57:07.794
Take your time.
Gonna be all right.

01:57:11.506 --> 01:57:12.506
I got you.

01:57:13.174 --> 01:57:15.468
- Hold his legs out.
- Hold them out, straight.

01:57:15.926 --> 01:57:18.471
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:57:45.540 --> 01:57:48.084
It's gonna be all right.
Hold that light up, Marlon.

01:57:50.336 --> 01:57:51.879
Lift him up. Lift him up.

01:58:06.894 --> 01:58:09.022
I held his heartbeat in my hand.

01:58:10.606 --> 01:58:12.067
My boy!

01:58:12.150 --> 01:58:13.901
I remember every beat.

01:58:15.861 --> 01:58:17.613
He was warm and alive.

01:58:20.783 --> 01:58:22.868
I know every place in him.

01:59:31.312 --> 01:59:33.106
Pappy?

01:59:34.857 --> 01:59:36.109
Pappy?

01:59:41.281 --> 01:59:42.990
It's exactly what you think it is.

01:59:46.119 --> 01:59:47.870
They got Ronsel.

01:59:50.123 --> 01:59:51.832
There were too many of them.

01:59:53.083 --> 01:59:56.003
What? Jamie, what happened to him?

01:59:56.086 --> 01:59:57.630
They were too many of 'em. I...

01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:01.301
- Jamie...
- I couldn't stop 'em.

02:00:02.426 --> 02:00:04.762
What did they do to him? Is he alive?

02:00:05.388 --> 02:00:08.183
- They made me choose.
- Choose what?

02:00:11.394 --> 02:00:12.562
Wake up.

02:00:20.278 --> 02:00:23.113
I wanted to make sure
I looked you in the eye.

02:01:02.570 --> 02:01:05.740
I appreciate it, sir. I'll, uh...

02:01:06.407 --> 02:01:08.701
I'll see you in a couple of days, huh?

02:01:21.214 --> 02:01:24.967
It's your father. He died last night.

02:01:30.014 --> 02:01:33.934
- How?
- In his sleep, peacefully.

02:01:59.877 --> 02:02:01.296
- Hap!
- Henry.

02:02:02.087 --> 02:02:03.589
- Hap!
- Henry, don't.

02:02:03.673 --> 02:02:05.758
It ain't my fault what happened.

02:02:05.841 --> 02:02:08.177
- I warned that boy. Warned both of 'em.
- Just let 'em go.

02:02:08.261 --> 02:02:09.345
Hap!

02:02:09.887 --> 02:02:11.347
Hap, can you hold on?

02:02:18.479 --> 02:02:20.815
Need to get the coffin in the ground.

02:02:28.448 --> 02:02:29.490
Hap?

02:02:41.001 --> 02:02:42.002
Hap?

02:02:49.093 --> 02:02:50.093
Appreciate it.

02:02:55.808 --> 02:02:56.928
Why don't you use your boys?

02:02:57.393 --> 02:02:59.770
My sons are not gettin' down
out of that wagon.

02:03:01.981 --> 02:03:03.148
Okay.

02:03:07.236 --> 02:03:08.153
There we go.

02:03:08.237 --> 02:03:12.033
"Man who is born of a woman
is of few days and full of trouble."

02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:15.370
He cometh forth like a flower
and is cut down.

02:03:15.453 --> 02:03:18.497
He fleeth as a shadow and continueth not.

02:03:19.039 --> 02:03:21.751
And doth thou open thine eyes
upon such a one,

02:03:21.834 --> 02:03:24.253
and bringest me into judgment with thee?

02:03:25.004 --> 02:03:29.216
Who can bring a clean thing
out of an unclean? Not one.

02:03:29.884 --> 02:03:31.051
For there is hope of a tree,

02:03:31.135 --> 02:03:33.888
if it be cut down,
that it will sprout again.

02:03:34.805 --> 02:03:37.099
But man dieth and wasteth away.

02:03:37.683 --> 02:03:40.520
As the waters fell from the sea
and drieth up,

02:03:40.603 --> 02:03:43.314
so man lieth down and riseth not.

02:03:44.565 --> 02:03:48.486
'Til the heavens be no more,
they shall not awake,

02:03:48.569 --> 02:03:50.780
"nor be raised out of their sleep."

02:03:54.659 --> 02:03:55.701
Amen.

02:03:57.202 --> 02:03:59.246
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:04:07.630 --> 02:04:08.672
All right, then.

02:04:09.549 --> 02:04:12.593
Come on, brother. Amen, Pappy.

02:04:26.399 --> 02:04:28.159
- Come on, girls.
- Florence?

02:04:31.236 --> 02:04:32.780
Give this to Ronsel...

02:04:37.493 --> 02:04:39.161
if you see him.

02:05:04.770 --> 02:05:05.855
Jamie!

02:05:08.941 --> 02:05:10.192
Jamie!

02:05:16.449 --> 02:05:17.825
Jamie!

02:05:26.959 --> 02:05:28.836
My nightmare's always the same.

02:05:31.088 --> 02:05:33.382
First, I'm in a tank wearing a helmet.

02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:38.012
Then I'm in the back of a car
with a burlap sack over my head.

02:05:39.972 --> 02:05:44.351
I scream.
My lips move, and I can feel the strain.

02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:47.146
But there's nothing coming out.

02:05:50.983 --> 02:05:52.985
I hope that my pappy's untimely death

02:05:53.068 --> 02:05:55.946
brought the Jackson family
some measure of peace.

02:05:56.989 --> 02:05:59.449
Though I must admit it brings me none.

02:06:02.202 --> 02:06:04.371
All the while hoping that,
by some miracle,

02:06:04.454 --> 02:06:06.916
- my friend Ronsel found happiness.
- Whoa! Whoa!

02:06:11.837 --> 02:06:13.673
But should my story end there?

02:06:15.424 --> 02:06:17.176
Silenced and defeated?

02:06:18.677 --> 02:06:22.723
Oppression, fear, deformity.

02:06:24.725 --> 02:06:27.728
It would take an extraordinary man
to beat all that.

02:06:29.605 --> 02:06:32.399
I would have to wean myself off
laudanum and self-pity...

02:06:33.359 --> 02:06:36.946
and travel with a little card
in my shirt pocket that said "mute."

02:06:41.825 --> 02:06:43.118
And then, finally...

02:06:44.411 --> 02:06:47.206
I would have to cross the Atlantic
yet again.

02:06:50.292 --> 02:06:51.835
This time not for war.

02:06:55.756 --> 02:06:57.174
But for love.

02:06:58.425 --> 02:07:00.052
Ronsel.

02:07:03.598 --> 02:07:04.724
Mama?

02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:35.295
And so I ended with that.

02:07:39.091 --> 02:07:40.175
With love.
