00:07.727 --> 00:10.116
You had Vic arrested?

00:10.286 --> 00:15.014
–I just filed a complaint.
–Well, he's spending the night
in jail right now.

00:15.054 --> 00:17.573
–I can't even bail him out till the morning.
–He broke into my house.

00:17.613 --> 00:21.797
Oh, come on. He worked his ass off
to pay for this house, Corrine.

00:21.837 --> 00:24.548
–What are you thinking?
–My kids are sleeping. Good night.

00:24.588 --> 00:28.035
–I really need for his head
to be in the game right now.
–Then go tell him.

00:28.075 --> 00:30.595
He's worried about you, and that kind
of distraction can get him killed.

00:30.635 --> 00:33.122
–Me and the other guys too.
–That's not my fault.

00:33.162 --> 00:35.594
Go home, Shane.

00:35.627 --> 00:40.230
Would you just back off?
Just leave him… Just leave him alone!

00:41.130 --> 00:43.010
–What were you thinking?
–Hey, where I come from…

00:43.050 --> 00:44.929
when a guy's lady jams him up,
his buddies have a talk with her.

00:44.969 --> 00:47.331
–Not in the middle of the night, Jethro.
–I'm sorry.

00:47.371 --> 00:49.217
But you need to be able
to concentrate right now.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.557
–Are you okay?
–Where are we with the money train?

00:52.776 --> 00:55.200
–It's definitely pulling out tonight.
–What's the new collection point?

00:55.240 --> 00:56.968
Well, we don't know yet.

00:57.001 --> 00:59.871
What about the guy who ran
the last site, shut it down?

00:59.911 --> 01:02.718
–We ran his plates. Got an address.
–His name's Chorekian.

01:02.758 --> 01:06.078
–He's the advance man.
–Follow him. Maybe he'll
take us to the new site.

01:06.118 --> 01:09.661
Took us two months to scout the last site.
You want to do this one in a few hours?

01:09.701 --> 01:13.149
We still got the truck, the equipment,
the plans. All that stays the same.

01:13.189 --> 01:16.188
–Might stay the same.
–Never get another chance like this again.

01:16.228 --> 01:19.164
Let's remember where
this Armenian money's coming from…

01:19.204 --> 01:21.276
prostitution, drugs, robberies.

01:21.411 --> 01:23.803
And the rest of this cash is just gonna
finance more of the same.

01:23.843 --> 01:26.362
They didn't earn it.
I don't feel bad about taking it.

01:26.402 --> 01:30.786
We get a little for ourselves,
set the Armenian mob back months.

01:30.819 --> 01:33.497
Ronnie, you gas up the truck,
ready the equipment.

01:33.537 --> 01:36.376
Shane, Lem, you get on
this Armenian advance man.

01:36.416 --> 01:38.552
–See where he takes us.
–All right. Come on.

01:38.592 --> 01:41.463
–David, who'd you vote for?
–I'll give you a hint.

01:41.503 --> 01:43.353
–He's Latino.
–And he's handsome.

01:43.393 --> 01:46.166
Any comment on the report
you recommended the chief fire…

01:46.206 --> 01:49.150
the anti-gang unit you oversee?

01:49.184 --> 01:53.205
I didn't feel they were meeting the high
standards we expect of our officers.

01:53.245 --> 01:56.916
The report also suggests
you offered yourself up as well.

01:56.956 --> 02:00.276
I'm their commanding officer.
They were my responsibility.

02:00.316 --> 02:05.464
If I'm gonna hold them to a high standard,
I should expect the same of myself.

02:08.579 --> 02:11.615
Chief Bankston, it's good
to finally meet you.

02:12.993 --> 02:17.149
Captain Aceveda seems to think
your team is a real problem.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.949
He's recommending that I fire you all.

02:23.424 --> 02:26.303
My team is responsible
for more than 50%…

02:26.337 --> 02:28.662
of drug and gang arrests
in that district.

02:28.702 --> 02:32.087
The results are impressive.
It's the methods that have me concerned.

02:32.127 --> 02:36.250
Aceveda and I don't always
see eye to eye on tactics.

02:36.414 --> 02:38.485
Well, that won't be
a problem for long.

02:38.525 --> 02:41.525
After he loses
the primary today, he's resigning.

02:41.565 --> 02:44.371
I don't know what kind of latitude
the last chief gave you…

02:44.411 --> 02:47.603
but I believe in doing things well
and doing them right.

02:47.643 --> 02:49.399
So do I.

02:49.531 --> 02:52.466
I know when a cop has
his toe over the line, Detective.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.338
Are you going to be able to maintain your
stellar arrest rate without crossing any lines?

02:56.378 --> 02:59.028
–Absolutely.
–Prove it to me…

02:59.225 --> 03:03.632
or I'll have no problem acting on
your captain's recommendations.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.406 --> 03:15.502
You put my team on the termination list
you gave to the chief?

03:15.542 --> 03:18.669
I don't have time for you.
I've gotta tell 27 people today…

03:18.709 --> 03:20.399
the chief's office
just fired them.

03:20.439 --> 03:23.855
That's right, and I'm not one of them.
You are, aren't you?

03:23.895 --> 03:26.733
Consider yourself
on desk duty for the day.

03:26.964 --> 03:29.358
–Where do you get off trying…
–I heard about your arrest.

03:29.398 --> 03:32.043
Congratulations.
Go clean up your own house…

03:32.083 --> 03:33.963
instead of continuing
to mess up mine.

03:34.003 --> 03:37.546
The chief wants me out making cases,
and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

03:37.586 --> 03:39.466
–I gave you an order.
–You're a goddamn lame duck.

03:39.506 --> 03:43.593
–An order you'll goddamn follow.
–Or what? You'll recommend that I'm fired?

03:43.633 --> 03:46.218
Been nice knowing you.

03:56.814 --> 03:58.821
Can you read his lips?

03:58.990 --> 04:02.088
Even if I could,
I don't speak Armenian, bro.

04:02.190 --> 04:04.741
That's his third call in the last five blocks.
He's definitely notifying the troops.

04:04.781 --> 04:07.747
All right. He's moving again.
He's moving.

04:07.884 --> 04:09.924
Follow the money.

04:10.060 --> 04:12.264
Let's go.

04:13.671 --> 04:17.084
Claudette, there's been
a homicide on Dresden.

04:17.637 --> 04:20.805
–Great. We're ready to roll.
–No.

04:20.838 --> 04:24.668
–The victim's your ex-husband, Jeff Franklin.
–You're kidding.

04:24.708 --> 04:27.163
Your daughter Bonnie's there.

04:27.428 --> 04:29.403
She's supposed to be
in Florida. Is she okay?

04:29.443 --> 04:31.323
I think so, but she's a witness.

04:31.363 --> 04:35.386
Dutch, you take the case.
You'll have to be limited to observing.

04:35.426 --> 04:37.211
Uh, I've got a personal involvement,
granted a tertiary one.

04:37.251 --> 04:39.066
Shouldn't you hand it off
to Brent or Marlon?

04:39.106 --> 04:42.489
We're gonna be a little shorthanded
today. The case is yours.

04:42.529 --> 04:44.667
–Brent, Marlon.
–Yeah, Captain.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.256
Can I see you
up in my office, please?

04:47.296 --> 04:49.084
Here it comes.

04:55.454 --> 04:57.941
–You ready?
–Not really.

05:08.348 --> 05:12.439
–Mom.
–There's blood. Let me get that for ya.

05:12.572 --> 05:15.506
–He shot him.
–I know.

05:15.643 --> 05:17.650
He's gone.

05:17.786 --> 05:20.339
I know, honey.

05:20.538 --> 05:22.993
–You got it.
–I'm sorry, Bonnie.

05:26.713 --> 05:29.328
There's not a single damn witness…
none that we could find…

05:29.368 --> 05:31.190
except the daughter.

05:31.384 --> 05:34.067
–That's Claudette's ex-husband?
–Yeah.

05:34.263 --> 05:37.519
Tell the M.E to move his ass. I want
the body released as soon as possible.

05:37.559 --> 05:39.315
Gotcha.

05:43.318 --> 05:45.199
Christ, is this guy
on quaaludes?

05:45.239 --> 05:48.045
He don't want to get pulled over.
It's a good sign.

05:48.085 --> 05:52.639
–Means he's close to a go.
–Goddamn it. Get your ass in gear, granny.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.835
Did he just hit him?

05:58.869 --> 06:01.546
I'm sorry. I didn't… I didn't think
you were gonna stop.

06:01.586 --> 06:04.873
–It's goddamn yellow. What's wrong with you?
–No reason to get upset.

06:04.913 --> 06:07.753
No reason for you. You drive a piece
of shit. I just bought this car.

06:07.793 --> 06:11.369
–Relax. I'm covered.
–We're gonna lose the
goddamn money train over this.

06:11.409 --> 06:14.856
–What do we do if…
–I don't know.

06:14.928 --> 06:17.448
–Oh, no way.
–Try getting outta here. Go around the block.

06:17.488 --> 06:19.567
–Shit.
–Cover up.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.207
–You saw him hit me, right?
–Yeah, he rear-ended you, man. It sucks.

06:23.247 --> 06:25.126
You be my witness for insurance?

06:25.166 --> 06:29.443
–You would do that?
–Sure. Yeah. I guess I could do that.

06:29.614 --> 06:31.621
–Yeah.
–Give me your number.

06:34.124 --> 06:36.484
You know, I tell you,
I'm always on the road.

06:36.524 --> 06:37.957
Maybe we should just
exchange cell numbers.

06:37.997 --> 06:42.221
–Otherwise, you know, we'll
probably never hook up.
–Yeah. Okay.

06:43.339 --> 06:45.732
It's always the ones that don't
give a shit about their cars…

06:45.772 --> 06:48.940
that run into yours.
–You don't have to tell me.

06:51.465 --> 06:53.886
I'm Armin Chorekian.

06:54.057 --> 06:56.512
–Cletis van Damme.
–Thank you for your help.

06:56.552 --> 06:59.072
I call you.

06:59.271 --> 07:01.343
Cletis van Damme?

07:01.480 --> 07:03.137
There's nothing major
going on right now.

07:03.177 --> 07:06.655
Streets are up for grabs, and there's not
one gang case in the last 24 hours…

07:06.695 --> 07:08.382
we can sink our teeth into?
–Sorry.

07:08.422 --> 07:10.909
Hey, what's the rush?

07:11.110 --> 07:13.021
The chief's evaluating our unit.

07:13.061 --> 07:15.677
We have to appear busy
and irreplaceable.

07:15.717 --> 07:18.365
I know Dutch is working
on a homicide from this morning.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.738
I don't know the details.

07:22.819 --> 07:25.982
Uh, Dutch-boy,
what are you workin' on?

07:26.051 --> 07:28.378
Claudette's ex-husband
was shot and killed.

07:28.418 --> 07:30.682
Her daughter Bonnie
witnessed the whole thing.

07:30.722 --> 07:32.762
Oh, man. What happened?

07:32.898 --> 07:36.697
They were sitting in a car,
black male walked up, said something…

07:36.737 --> 07:39.006
then just shot the guy
ran away.

07:39.169 --> 07:40.728
–It's a gang thing?
–I don't know…

07:40.768 --> 07:43.064
and Bonnie's been
too upset to talk to.

07:43.104 --> 07:45.079
I still don't know
why she and her dad were there.

07:45.119 --> 07:47.959
Let me work the gang angle.
See if there's anything there.

07:47.999 --> 07:51.544
Great. I'll make a copy
of my notes up till now.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.123
If he's in here,
I'll recognize him.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.230
There are a lot of pictures
in there, so take your time.

07:58.270 --> 08:01.684
You need to take a break
to eat, anything, just ask, okay?

08:01.724 --> 08:03.447
Okay.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.445
You do me a favor.
You see him in there, you tell me first.

08:07.485 --> 08:11.193
–Don't say anything to Dutch, okay?
–Why?

08:11.291 --> 08:13.170
Because there are
a lot of ways to make a case…

08:13.210 --> 08:16.529
and being a star eyewitness at a murder trial
doesn't have to be your first option.

08:16.569 --> 08:18.577
Not with the kind of guy
who did this.

08:18.617 --> 08:21.168
–This is Dad we're talking about.
–I know.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.575
I don't care what I have to do.

08:25.911 --> 08:29.711
I know you feel that way right now,
but I'm only watching out for you.

08:29.751 --> 08:31.731
God, Mom.
I can't believe you.

08:31.735 --> 08:35.087
I'm not talking about
letting whoever did this go free.

08:35.128 --> 08:38.734
I just don't want you to get into
something you can't get out of later.

08:38.774 --> 08:41.807
If you see him in there,
you tell me first.

08:44.660 --> 08:46.838
I hear you called Julien's house.

08:46.868 --> 08:49.067
Told his little boy
that he was gay?

08:49.107 --> 08:52.076
–I think you got the wrong guys.
–I got the right assholes.

08:52.116 --> 08:55.626
The both of you have been shooting your
mouths off about how much fun you're having.

08:55.666 --> 08:58.986
I got no problem with someone
being gay out there, but in here I…

08:59.026 --> 09:01.001
If it's so cool, why doesn't he just
come out and say it?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.153
Why is he lying
about who he is?

09:03.249 --> 09:05.295
I'm putting you both on notice.

09:05.393 --> 09:08.109
Fun's over, or I end it myself.

09:13.903 --> 09:15.942
–Herman, what do you got?
–Something.

09:15.982 --> 09:18.382
But what's in it for my boys?

09:18.416 --> 09:21.926
We lay off that gambling joint
you're running near MacArthur Park.

09:21.966 --> 09:26.520
–What gambling joint?
–The one in the back
of Morty's Sporting Goods.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.086
Oh, that one. Okay.

09:30.284 --> 09:31.781
So you all heard
of the E-ParkJohnnies?

09:31.821 --> 09:35.011
–Not recently. They still kicking around?
–They still breathing.

09:35.051 --> 09:38.884
With Armadillo and the Torrucos out
of business, everything is opening up out there.

09:38.924 --> 09:41.186
The Johnnies are looking to get back
on top of the bangers heap.

09:41.226 --> 09:42.852
Good luck.

09:43.018 --> 09:46.120
Jesus Christ, Herman, pick that up.
Pick it up!

09:47.752 --> 09:50.986
Hey, sorry, man.
Strictly for medicinal purposes.

09:52.072 --> 09:53.952
So what does the Johnnies
trying to bring back the glory days…

09:53.992 --> 09:56.255
have to do with some dad
getting shot in his car?

09:56.295 --> 09:59.648
All I heard was the Johnnies were bragging
about throwing some kind of April Fool's party.

09:59.688 --> 10:02.686
–April Fool's party?
–Yeah, that's all I heard, man.

10:02.726 --> 10:05.060
–Bonnie.
–Yes?

10:05.125 --> 10:08.670
–Hi, I'm Detective Mackey.
–Hi. Tavon Garris.

10:08.964 --> 10:10.717
–Hi.
–I'm sorry about your father.

10:10.757 --> 10:13.532
–Thank you.
–I just have one question for you.

10:13.572 --> 10:16.892
The shooter… he said something
to your dad before he fired?

10:16.932 --> 10:20.694
Yes. I… I couldn't hear him very well.
The window was up.

10:20.738 --> 10:24.087
Did it sound like,
“Johnny says April Fool's”?

10:24.354 --> 10:27.005
It was something
like that, yeah.

10:27.201 --> 10:30.779
I couldn't hear it clear, but…
What does that mean?

10:30.977 --> 10:32.765
Bonnie?

10:33.761 --> 10:36.924
–What are you doing?
–Answering his questions.

10:37.344 --> 10:39.449
He's not involved in this case.

10:46.494 --> 10:48.408
Look, 10 years ago,
the E-ParkJohnnies…

10:48.448 --> 10:50.549
were the predominant
gang in Farmington.

10:50.589 --> 10:52.502
They controlled drugs,
sex, everything.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.868
Until the Mexicans
started outnumbering them.

10:54.908 --> 10:57.108
Compton gangs started moving in,
squeezed the Johnnies right out.

10:57.148 --> 10:59.995
I talked to my
old partner, Joe Clarke.

11:00.029 --> 11:03.443
He says the E-ParkJohnnies
used to throw what they called
April Fool's parties.

11:03.483 --> 11:05.206
What are those?

11:05.371 --> 11:07.763
Every year they tally up how many
members got killed out on the street…

11:07.803 --> 11:10.802
then they get the whole membership
together, and they pick dominoes.

11:10.842 --> 11:12.913
–Dominoes?
–Yeah. You pick the right one…

11:12.953 --> 11:14.642
you get to be one of
the shooters.

11:14.682 --> 11:17.265
–Who'd they shoot?
–Didn't matter. Walk right up to 'em…

11:17.305 --> 11:20.144
and say, “Johnny says April Fool's,”
boom… they'd shoot 'em.

11:20.184 --> 11:24.463
And, uh, that's what your daughter
heard the shooter say this morning.

11:24.503 --> 11:26.574
The April Fool's parties dried up
about 10 years ago…

11:26.614 --> 11:28.462
but looks like
they're back on.

11:28.502 --> 11:31.797
Thanks for the tip.
Dutch'll take care of it.

11:31.958 --> 11:35.309
–Is there a problem with
us helping or something?
–No, it doesn't concern you.

11:35.349 --> 11:37.421
Dutch will take care of it.

11:42.708 --> 11:45.100
Run the gang database for Johnnies
that were killed in the last year…

11:45.140 --> 11:47.307
and get a current address
for their leader.

11:47.347 --> 11:49.289
Uh, street name's Lops.

11:49.427 --> 11:51.436
–Lops?
–He's got a lopsided head.

11:51.476 --> 11:55.106
–I don't know his real tag.
–All right. I'm working it.

11:59.793 --> 12:02.664
–You lost him?
–He got in a fender bender
right in front of us.

12:02.704 --> 12:06.063
–We're his witnesses.
–You gotta be shittin' me.

12:06.096 --> 12:08.902
Once he saw our faces and our ride,
we couldn't stay too close.

12:08.942 --> 12:12.262
We stayed back for a while,
tried to follow him. We lost him.

12:12.302 --> 12:14.854
Everything's ready, and you tell me
we still don't know where to go?

12:14.894 --> 12:18.276
We got his cell number.
Maybe we can trace it.

12:18.381 --> 12:22.603
–Not without a warrant.
–Yeah, and it's a trail we can't leave.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.205
Where's Radiohead's
crib these days?

12:31.915 --> 12:33.737
Radiohead?

12:36.394 --> 12:39.298
–Ugh!
–Oh, my God! What, did he die in here?

12:39.465 --> 12:41.766
Radiohead,
show us your ass!

12:44.008 --> 12:45.731
Hey, put the gun down!

12:45.768 --> 12:48.448
I told you guys to stop
barging in on me like this.

12:48.488 --> 12:51.807
God, man! When was the last time
you took a shower?

12:51.847 --> 12:55.550
–The water got shut off last month.
–Ever heard of a sponge bath?

12:55.590 --> 12:58.910
–I'm boycotting all things French.
–We got tracer software.

12:58.950 --> 13:01.790
We know you trace cell phones for
the Baja Diablo cartel.

13:01.830 --> 13:05.064
–You pick 'em right out of the air, right?
–Yeah.

13:06.084 --> 13:07.037
We need a location
on a cell phone.

13:07.077 --> 13:10.043
I can pull the cell
phones off the towers…

13:10.308 --> 13:13.724
but if he's not transmitting, I won't be
able to triangulate his exact location.

13:13.764 --> 13:16.570
We'll settle for an approximate.
Ronnie's gonna run the numbers.

13:16.610 --> 13:19.250
The rest of us are headed for
fresh air.

13:23.233 --> 13:27.512
That's really nice, you sending your fag
hag partner to fight your battles.

13:27.552 --> 13:31.064
–I'm working.
–How come you lied to us about who you are?

13:31.104 --> 13:34.103
How are we supposed to trust you with
our lives if you're gonna lie like that, Julien?

13:34.143 --> 13:36.383
I'll do my job. You do yours.

13:36.417 --> 13:39.702
You know what bothers me the most?
Is that you're a hypocrite.

13:39.742 --> 13:43.862
You gave that faggot a blanket party, knowing
you'd like to be under the blanket with him.

13:43.902 --> 13:46.294
You call my son again,
and I'll kill you.

13:46.334 --> 13:49.013
You know, maybe I should've called
Social Services.

13:49.053 --> 13:51.495
See if that kid
still has his cherry.

13:56.028 --> 13:59.526
You understand me?
Call him again, and I'll kill you.

14:04.058 --> 14:07.121
You think you could do
this job by yourself, huh?

14:07.161 --> 14:10.737
You don't need backup?
'Cause they're never gonna show up.

14:10.777 --> 14:13.362
–I want to see a show, man!
–Easy.

14:17.783 --> 14:19.888
What's wrong?

14:22.998 --> 14:25.397
Maybe, uh, Jeff's murder…

14:25.431 --> 14:29.325
wasn't part of some gangland
April Fool's prank.

14:29.717 --> 14:31.637
Bonnie's being, uh, vague…

14:31.670 --> 14:34.476
about what they were doing
in that neighborhood.

14:34.516 --> 14:37.745
That area's a known drug market.

14:37.908 --> 14:39.663
Stop right there.

14:39.859 --> 14:41.548
I did some checking on Jeff.

14:41.588 --> 14:44.235
He had a bit of a rough go of it
after your divorce.

14:44.275 --> 14:46.729
A couple of dope charges.

14:46.898 --> 14:50.029
Disturbing the peace.

14:50.193 --> 14:53.508
Is there anything you wanna
tell me about him?

14:53.680 --> 14:57.062
He had his demons.

14:57.232 --> 15:00.362
None that deserved
to get him killed.

15:00.495 --> 15:02.250
Okay.

15:04.558 --> 15:06.380
Anything yet?

15:06.606 --> 15:08.362
No.

15:10.221 --> 15:13.157
Was your father doing something
down there he shouldn't have been?

15:13.197 --> 15:16.196
–Mom…
–Something to do with drugs?

15:20.459 --> 15:22.339
You always thought
the worst of him.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.931
–No, I didn't.
–You did.

15:25.131 --> 15:27.771
You don't remember.
You were very young.

15:28.970 --> 15:31.872
Why didn't you tell me
you were in town?

15:32.169 --> 15:34.656
Dad wanted to see me.

15:34.825 --> 15:37.094
It was only for a couple of days.

15:37.321 --> 15:40.357
I just didn't wanna be
running back and forth.

15:47.654 --> 15:49.345
Did you find him?

15:49.542 --> 15:53.405
His signal has appeared somewhere in
the sector between these three cell towers.

15:53.445 --> 15:56.576
This is mostly
unoccupied industrial area.

15:56.709 --> 16:00.476
–Same type of place as last time.
–That's gotta be where
the money train's pulling in.

16:00.516 --> 16:04.542
Do some recon. See if the old plan
will work at the new site.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.138
Hey, I got that
crib address on Lops.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.986
–I'll have a warrant within an hour.
–That's great.

16:13.026 --> 16:17.113
–What are y'all doin' in?
–Can't stay away from this
place, even on our day off.

16:17.153 --> 16:19.265
I'll leave you two to your work.

16:20.736 --> 16:23.640
–How long till you get down here?
–Soon, I promise.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.551
Machado called. Your interview's
playing all over the tube.

16:26.591 --> 16:29.847
–People are responding.
–But we were four points back just last night.

16:29.887 --> 16:31.735
The exit polls are encouraging.

16:31.775 --> 16:35.230
–How's Hispanic turnout?
–Better than expected.

16:35.263 --> 16:39.025
Machado says we really have a chance, baby.
We really do.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.410
Uh, I'll see you
as soon as I can.

16:43.549 --> 16:45.370
–I love you, babe.
–Me too.

16:49.308 --> 16:53.016
Randy. Come on in.

16:56.122 --> 16:58.991
–Yeah?
–Hey. We found it.

16:59.129 --> 17:01.703
It's almost identical
to our last site.

17:01.849 --> 17:03.433
One way in, one way out.

17:03.512 --> 17:05.650
Even has a Dumpster we can use.

17:05.784 --> 17:08.622
–They're still settin' up.
–So it's doable?

17:08.632 --> 17:12.262
–It's absolutely doable.
–Let me talk to him for a sec.

17:12.694 --> 17:14.926
Hey, boss, look,
if they change locations…

17:14.967 --> 17:17.486
maybe there's other aspects
they've changed too.

17:17.526 --> 17:19.892
Let me see it.
Let me see it.

17:20.054 --> 17:22.317
Look, it's right in our
comfort zone, Vic.

17:22.357 --> 17:25.520
Okay. What's the vote, then?
I'm good.

17:25.684 --> 17:28.050
He wants a vote.
He's in, so am I.

17:28.212 --> 17:30.456
–What about you two?
–Let's do it.

17:38.098 --> 17:41.447
–Okay.
–We're good to go.

17:50.064 --> 17:51.975
Thanks for
inviting us in, Lops.

17:52.015 --> 17:54.764
–You didn't get no invite!
–Sure we did.

17:54.959 --> 17:58.122
I can back him up on that.

17:58.222 --> 18:01.606
–What you want, man?
–How are the Johnnies these days?

18:01.646 --> 18:03.597
Black is back.

18:03.631 --> 18:05.957
You lost three of your Johnny bros
this year, huh?

18:05.997 --> 18:07.785
And loved them all.

18:08.876 --> 18:12.137
You like playing dominoes, Lops?

18:12.236 --> 18:14.499
You're bringing back
the April Fool's parties, huh?

18:14.539 --> 18:18.183
I got one man dead already.
A black man, by the way.

18:18.443 --> 18:20.836
When are you dumbasses gonna shoot up
Beverly Hills for a change, huh?

18:20.876 --> 18:24.308
There are two more shooters
out there, aren't there?

18:28.713 --> 18:31.266
I don't see any
double threes here, Lops.

18:31.306 --> 18:33.568
That's the magic
number this year, isn't it?

18:33.608 --> 18:36.768
–Double threes for your three dead homies.
–Whatever, man.

18:36.808 --> 18:38.375
Who are the shooters?

18:38.408 --> 18:41.438
You better step off, man,
before I get my Cochrane involved.

18:41.478 --> 18:43.682
You think we playing, Lop-head?

18:55.492 --> 18:58.269
Hey, come on, man. You ain't gonna
do nothin'with that.

18:58.309 --> 19:01.147
You know who your buddy
killed today, Lops?

19:01.155 --> 19:03.674
Look, man, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

19:03.714 --> 19:07.610
–That was the husband of a cop.
–A cop we work with, asshole.

19:07.650 --> 19:10.519
She's a friend of mine,
and you…

19:10.657 --> 19:12.569
you killed her husband.
–No, man!

19:12.609 --> 19:14.202
Goddamn!

19:16.224 --> 19:19.288
You only got five more
wrong answers in you, boy.

19:19.328 --> 19:23.004
Now, who… are…
the shooters?

19:23.199 --> 19:26.486
The only thing worse than killing a cop
is killing a cop's loved one…

19:26.526 --> 19:28.968
so you know I will
pull this trigger.

19:29.053 --> 19:32.789
We'll just write it down as another nigger
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

19:32.829 --> 19:36.757
Mmm!

19:36.892 --> 19:40.308
–Who are they?
–This is gonna be the one, Tavon. I can feel it.

19:40.348 --> 19:42.322
Yeah, me too.

19:42.459 --> 19:45.459
I better get my raincoat.

19:45.595 --> 19:47.383
Okay! Okay! Okay, man!

19:47.579 --> 19:51.768
Okay! Okay! Okay!
Just put the gun down.

19:51.929 --> 19:55.632
You put the gun down,
I'll play ball with you, all right?

19:55.672 --> 19:57.585
What happened with
you and Jackson?

19:57.625 --> 19:59.472
Nothing we can't
handle ourselves, sir.

19:59.512 --> 20:03.375
I know what's going on, Julien.
What you've been subjected to.

20:03.415 --> 20:07.150
I don't care about your personal life.
What I do care about is intolerance.

20:07.190 --> 20:09.678
If you have a complaint…

20:09.846 --> 20:11.694
now is the time to lodge it.

20:11.733 --> 20:14.439
Like I said, sir,
nothing I can't handle.

20:15.670 --> 20:17.360
Okay, then.

20:28.147 --> 20:30.252
Okay, they're here.
Do me a favor.

20:30.292 --> 20:33.322
–Ask them if they can give you
a ride back to the barn.
–Is everything all right?

20:33.362 --> 20:38.642
Oh, yeah, I just gotta be somewhere for
an hour. I'll check back in on you then.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.221
Your partner's a goddamn psycho!

20:46.384 --> 20:48.206
Yes, he is.

20:48.399 --> 20:51.105
Then you tell that
asshole he's too late.

20:55.086 --> 20:56.776
Too late for what?

20:56.974 --> 20:59.717
Charlie there's already at
the street fair right now.

20:59.757 --> 21:04.099
Too late, man.
Hey, you tell him that.

21:07.755 --> 21:10.624
Yo, Tavon!

21:10.763 --> 21:13.283
–Yo!
–Go get my truck, quick.

21:13.482 --> 21:16.515
Let's go. You!
Come and take this man!

21:18.921 --> 21:20.738
Find out where
there's a street fair in this area.

21:20.778 --> 21:23.682
Get every unit.
We got a shooter down there.

21:29.223 --> 21:31.103
–Yeah?
–I'm gonna be
running a little bit late.

21:31.143 --> 21:33.022
You and Shane are gonna have to
start without me.

21:33.062 --> 21:35.422
–How late? What are you talking about?
–I can't explain right now.

21:35.462 --> 21:37.886
–What's he sayin'?
–He might not be makin' it.

21:37.926 --> 21:41.622
Are you serious? Vic, we'll never
get this chance again.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.326
–Please!
–Put Shane on.

21:46.341 --> 21:48.925
–Vic, what's going on?
–I'm gonna make it.

21:48.965 --> 21:51.131
You're just gonna have to start
the plan without me.

21:51.171 --> 21:54.491
–What if you get stuck or something?
–You can still do it.

21:54.531 --> 21:58.331
–No. No way. Not without you.
–You planned for three. You still got three.

21:58.371 --> 22:01.625
–That's when you were one of the three.
–You could still do this.

22:01.665 --> 22:05.112
I trust you.
I'll be there when I can.

22:08.769 --> 22:10.557
I'm driving.

22:13.279 --> 22:15.253
Goddamn it.

22:16.415 --> 22:19.097
What three-person plan?

22:20.702 --> 22:23.765
–You were ready to do this without me?
–You always had reservations.

22:23.805 --> 22:25.533
It was only Plan “B.”

22:25.567 --> 22:28.085
–Fine. Let's go with Plan “B” then.
–I don't know.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.612
Until we see if Vic's gonna make it,
it's too risky.

22:30.652 --> 22:34.611
We don't get on the inside now, the whole
thing will be ruined, even if Vic does show up.

22:34.651 --> 22:38.066
–All right, I vote we go now.
–Me too.

24:16.392 --> 24:20.064
Okay, we're looking for the guy on
the right. Pass it around. He's armed.

24:20.104 --> 24:22.340
Follow me. Come on.

24:27.687 --> 24:30.370
Fan out. Fan out.

24:30.566 --> 24:32.322
Take that way inside.

25:06.528 --> 25:09.658
Guys, come on!

25:28.572 --> 25:30.360
Double threes.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.162
–Take him!
–Take him.

25:36.058 --> 25:38.229
Don't move. Don't move.

25:40.377 --> 25:43.639
–That's not bad for a day's work, huh?
–Yeah.

25:43.736 --> 25:47.415
Hey, listen.
You could do me a favor.

25:47.449 --> 25:50.415
–I gotta be somewhere.
–I'll take care of the paperwork.

25:50.455 --> 25:52.397
Thanks.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.440
Only two more vans to go.

26:04.852 --> 26:06.608
What's this?

26:14.803 --> 26:16.811
What the hell
are they talkin'about?

26:16.851 --> 26:19.029
What, like I speak
European hick?

26:20.722 --> 26:23.307
Goddamn it.
What the hell is goin'on?

26:26.161 --> 26:28.365
Oh, Jesus Christ.

26:30.704 --> 26:32.362
Jesus Christ.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.021
Holy sh…

26:37.998 --> 26:40.704
–What do we do now?
–I gotta stop Ronnie.

26:41.038 --> 26:43.398
Maybe the best thing to do
is just stick to the plan.

26:43.438 --> 26:45.319
We don't even know
if Vic's made it yet.

26:45.359 --> 26:49.220
–And I'm callin' Ronnie off.
–Look, they got sidearms. We got rifles, man.

26:49.260 --> 26:51.524
No. The whole plan
was no bloodshed.

26:51.564 --> 26:53.859
It's all screwed up now.
Oh, Christ.

26:53.899 --> 26:57.507
Look, it's not their money. They're not gonna
die for it, okay? We can do this.

26:57.547 --> 27:00.328
Look, I'm not gettin'
you two killed.

27:00.522 --> 27:02.278
–Goddamn it!
–What?

27:02.442 --> 27:05.321
There's no reception.
I gotta get a signal.

27:05.355 --> 27:08.609
Will you stop movin' around, man?
They're gonna see us.

27:08.649 --> 27:11.777
Hey, listen, there isn't
cell service here, remember?

27:11.817 --> 27:15.513
We're in the black hole.
That's how we found this place.

27:15.752 --> 27:20.421
Sir, I need to talk to you about
Jackson and Carlson.

27:20.615 --> 27:22.398
Is this about the fight with Julien?

27:22.438 --> 27:24.670
Yeah, and the homophobic flyers
and the gay bashing.

27:24.710 --> 27:29.594
–They're behind all of that.
–I talked to Julien. He didn't mention names.

27:30.053 --> 27:32.289
Right. Look, I'm not a rat, sir…

27:32.389 --> 27:35.229
but those guys have been making noises
about not backing us up on the street.

27:35.269 --> 27:37.980
I mean, that's Julien's life and that's
my life. I'm not gonna let that pass.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.986
Thank you for
mentioning it to me.

27:41.123 --> 27:44.319
Since you're here,
I need to talk to you.

27:44.482 --> 27:46.810
You know that the chief's
put together a list…

27:46.850 --> 27:50.105
and we've gotta cut 20% of the force.
–You're kidding me.

27:50.145 --> 27:52.862
Your name's on the list.

27:53.056 --> 27:55.036
Armadillo's death in the cage.

28:02.655 --> 28:05.719
I got suspended for that. I paid
the price. You're firing me for it?

28:05.759 --> 28:07.995
It's the chief's call.

28:10.685 --> 28:12.473
I'm sorry.

28:18.780 --> 28:22.835
Have you talked to Vic and the Strike
Team about how that guy got the knife?

28:22.875 --> 28:26.139
–I've heard the rumors.
–Yeah?

28:26.173 --> 28:30.322
Who's looking into it while my career's
being flushed down the goddamn toilet?

28:30.362 --> 28:33.231
Right now… nobody.

28:54.997 --> 28:56.405
Here's Ronnie.

28:56.438 --> 29:00.365
–He must have heard the shots.
–Ohh, oh, this is not good.

29:00.564 --> 29:04.920
–Where is Vic?
–We gotta do this now,
before he's hung out to dry.

29:04.980 --> 29:09.779
Look, I'm gonna take the guy
with the MP-5.

29:09.813 --> 29:13.034
You take the skinny guy with the beanie
and the blowgun.

29:13.074 --> 29:15.384
Come on, man.
We gotta do this now.

29:19.025 --> 29:21.294
On the goddamn ground!

29:21.841 --> 29:23.945
–Get down right now!
–Get down!

29:24.080 --> 29:26.763
Everybody down now!

29:27.983 --> 29:30.284
Get your ass down! Down!

29:30.447 --> 29:33.316
Get on the ground!

29:33.454 --> 29:37.131
Get down! Get down there!

29:37.325 --> 29:39.239
–You good? You clear?
–Clear!

29:39.341 --> 29:41.642
Goddamn it, this guy's hurt.

29:41.805 --> 29:44.004
–Face down!
–Oh, shit. It's the last van.

29:44.044 --> 29:47.491
Guys, don't move,
don't move. Do not…

29:47.660 --> 29:49.482
Okay.

29:56.810 --> 29:59.679
Go. Go get him!

30:01.033 --> 30:02.724
Don't move!

30:10.248 --> 30:14.142
–Stay right there! Hands on the wheel!
–Go, go, go, go, go!

30:20.613 --> 30:22.885
Thank God
you made it, man.

30:22.918 --> 30:26.086
What the hell happened here?
We got dead bodies?

30:26.117 --> 30:28.445
It wasn't us.
They turned on each other.

30:28.485 --> 30:31.100
Ronnie heard the shots.
The whole thing went down a van early.

30:31.140 --> 30:32.961
Jesus!

30:33.123 --> 30:36.635
–We gotta go. If anybody heard those shots…
–We also got a wounded Armenian.

30:36.675 --> 30:39.003
If this guy doesn't get medical help,
he's gonna bleed out and die.

30:39.043 --> 30:40.794
That's not our problem.
We didn't shoot him.

30:40.834 --> 30:42.428
Now let's load up
and get the hell outta here.

30:42.468 --> 30:44.505
Yeah, so we didn't shoot him,
but we can save him.

30:44.545 --> 30:47.251
I don't want that blood
on my conscience.

30:49.376 --> 30:52.409
Me either. We better hurry.
Let's go.

30:59.838 --> 31:02.676
–Do you want to live or die?
–Live. Please.

31:02.687 --> 31:06.581
Well, then, you listen
very carefully, Dach.

31:06.973 --> 31:09.813
–We're gonna get you to the doctor.
–Thank you.

31:09.853 --> 31:11.924
Then we're gonna stop by your house
and hide some of this money…

31:11.964 --> 31:14.357
and since you're the only guy
who's gonna be missing from here…

31:14.397 --> 31:19.027
your buddies are gonna figure that we took
care of you because you were our inside man.

31:19.067 --> 31:20.850
They'll come looking for you…

31:20.890 --> 31:22.803
and the only thing they'll find
at your house is their stolen cash.

31:22.843 --> 31:25.170
And then they'll know
you were the one…

31:25.210 --> 31:27.793
who tipped us off
about the money train.

31:27.833 --> 31:32.112
–I don't even know who you are.
–Well, that's gonna be our little secret.

31:32.152 --> 31:36.688
Once you get fixed up, you're running
away, Dach, and never coming back.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.891
Yes. Just get me help, please.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.503
Do you see the man
that shot your father?

31:58.260 --> 32:00.240
–What?
–If this goes to trial…

32:00.339 --> 32:03.567
I don't want Bonnie being a witness…

32:03.730 --> 32:06.119
in a gang killing.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.079
Understand?

32:13.553 --> 32:16.008
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

32:28.974 --> 32:31.691
If I were to question these men…

32:33.453 --> 32:36.027
any idea who I should
start with first?

32:44.427 --> 32:46.151
I'd start with number two.

32:49.674 --> 32:51.561
You and your two friends…

32:51.595 --> 32:54.881
You all drew the double-three dominoes.
We found one on each of you.

32:54.921 --> 32:57.921
Two of you didn't kill anyone,
but one of you did.

32:57.961 --> 32:59.872
I don't know nothin'
about no killin'.

32:59.912 --> 33:02.464
Okay, we'll see who your two friends
point the finger at…

33:02.504 --> 33:04.448
'cause one of you is going to jail.

33:04.488 --> 33:06.146
Hang up!

33:06.343 --> 33:08.958
I don't want to go to jail
for something I didn't do…

33:08.998 --> 33:12.838
just 'cause one of them
said I did.

33:12.871 --> 33:15.907
Then put someone else there.
I don't care who.

33:20.260 --> 33:23.129
It was Mouser.
He did it.

33:26.148 --> 33:27.871
Hey.

33:28.067 --> 33:30.488
–Make it in time?
–Where?

33:30.658 --> 33:32.826
–Wherever you were going.
–Oh, yeah.

33:32.866 --> 33:35.354
Just an errand.

33:35.522 --> 33:37.496
Got it handled.
No biggie.

33:37.633 --> 33:39.521
Anything happen around here?

33:39.555 --> 33:41.913
We got the other two domino shooters
without any other killings.

33:41.953 --> 33:44.857
–Dutch is upstairs sorting them out.
–Sweet.

33:44.896 --> 33:46.718
Anything else happening?

33:46.912 --> 33:50.260
Nah. Other than that,
it's been quiet.

33:50.431 --> 33:52.340
Good.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.707
–What's up?
–I just got fired.

33:55.774 --> 33:59.035
–What?
–Yeah. My name's on the casualty list.

33:59.101 --> 34:01.493
–Any guesses why?
–Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

34:01.533 --> 34:05.556
You're the one that's always talking about
your boys being such stand-up guys…

34:05.596 --> 34:09.491
You and I both know that my name
doesn't belong on that list.

34:09.531 --> 34:12.963
Let's see how much of
a stand-up guy you really are.

34:18.041 --> 34:20.728
–What?
–You fired Danny?

34:20.763 --> 34:24.688
–The chief's office did.
–She doesn't deserve that.
You got to do something.

34:24.728 --> 34:27.089
Armadillo died because Danny
didn't properly pat down the prisoner.

34:27.129 --> 34:29.871
–Ah…
–Unless you have something
to share with the chief…

34:29.911 --> 34:31.853
this conversation's over.

34:31.991 --> 34:34.379
Do you?
Or are you a coward?

34:40.117 --> 34:42.321
Too bad.

34:42.485 --> 34:44.558
She was a good officer.

34:51.443 --> 34:54.378
It was Mouser.
He did it.

34:56.627 --> 34:58.291
Ohh, man!

34:58.324 --> 35:01.226
I can't believe
he'd just give me up like that.

35:01.266 --> 35:04.713
–I didn't do it.
–You ready to give him up?

35:07.089 --> 35:08.878
He killed that man.

35:09.041 --> 35:11.688
He wanted to be the first one
of the three of us.

35:11.728 --> 35:13.419
Real important to him.

35:13.615 --> 35:16.231
How do I know you're the one
telling the truth?

35:16.271 --> 35:20.493
Yo, I fill you in
on where he hides his gun.

35:29.421 --> 35:32.919
–I hear we got the shooters upstairs.
–Looks like it.

35:34.060 --> 35:37.060
Well, not to pat myself
on the back or anything…

35:37.100 --> 35:39.344
Results don't excuse bad behavior.

35:44.938 --> 35:46.661
Tell you what.

35:46.857 --> 35:49.185
It's clear you and I
have some issues…

35:49.225 --> 35:53.122
so why don't we agree just not to work
with each other anymore.

35:53.162 --> 35:56.488
The question isn't whether
I can work with you.

35:56.522 --> 35:59.553
It's how you're gonna handle
working for me.

36:05.606 --> 36:07.548
You?

36:09.093 --> 36:10.784
Me.

36:21.539 --> 36:23.579
Fired for cause.

36:23.715 --> 36:25.438
Fired for cause.

36:25.635 --> 36:27.234
This is bullshit!

36:27.268 --> 36:29.913
They're gonna have the most P.C.,
useless force in the country.

36:29.953 --> 36:32.122
Julien gets outed
and throws a bitch-fit…

36:32.162 --> 36:34.233
and we take the fall
for some friendly ribbing?

36:34.273 --> 36:36.538
Maybe they just don't get
your sophisticated brand of humor.

36:36.578 --> 36:40.152
You trying to tell me this place is better off
with him than the three of us?

36:40.192 --> 36:43.954
Don't put me in your corner.
I didn't deserve what I got.

37:03.003 --> 37:05.364
I have prepared two speeches
for this evening.

37:05.404 --> 37:07.667
I hope I get to use the one
in my left pocket.

37:07.707 --> 37:10.041
But whatever happens, win or lose…

37:10.203 --> 37:11.926
I thank you all.

37:12.122 --> 37:14.456
Your support
has been a blessing.

37:14.617 --> 37:16.689
To my lovely wife, Aurora…

37:16.825 --> 37:18.548
te amo.

37:18.777 --> 37:22.257
Tu eres mi estrella brillante.

37:30.006 --> 37:32.395
Danny.

37:32.566 --> 37:35.054
This isn't fair.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.076
No, it's not.

37:38.741 --> 37:41.043
Look, um…

37:41.205 --> 37:43.921
I can't tell you…

37:44.116 --> 37:47.431
how much I… I've
learned from you.

37:47.636 --> 37:49.872
Well, here's one last thing…

37:51.315 --> 37:54.351
You watch your back
around these people, okay?

38:21.933 --> 38:24.388
–Any sign of Armenians yet?
–Nope.

38:24.557 --> 38:26.884
–How's our bleeder?
–Dropped him off at a clinica.

38:26.924 --> 38:28.837
Backroom doc's sewing him up
as we speak.

38:28.877 --> 38:31.939
Our bleeder's gonna make it,
and he's gonna shake out of town.

38:31.979 --> 38:34.019
Good. Let's finish this.

38:35.786 --> 38:39.458
Although statewide turnout has been
somewhat lower than average…

38:39.498 --> 38:42.204
–How deep you wanna bury this?
–Not very.

38:42.377 --> 38:46.667
These transplants from Brighton Beach
are more beach than bright.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.640
In the city council races…
–Hey.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.519
District three is reporting in now
with 89% of the vote.

38:51.559 --> 38:54.079
Nah, nah. A little more clever
than that, okay?

38:54.119 --> 38:56.991
The fifth district is still tight,
with Elliot Orlon edging closer…

38:57.031 --> 39:00.227
to incumbent
Barnard Fortain.

39:00.390 --> 39:02.756
Hey. This is good.

39:02.917 --> 39:06.481
Police Captain David Aceveda
won a tight primary race…

39:06.629 --> 39:09.277
against challenger Karen Mitchell
to become that district's…

39:09.317 --> 39:12.578
first Hispanic
Democratic candidate for council.

39:12.740 --> 39:15.903
And since the district
is 82% Democrat…

39:16.035 --> 39:18.555
it's a safe bet that Aceveda
will soon be the first elected…

39:18.595 --> 39:20.602
Hispanic representative
on the council…

39:20.642 --> 39:22.777
from the Farmington District
of Los Angeles.

39:22.817 --> 39:25.498
–I thought he was gonna lose.
–He was supposed to.

39:25.538 --> 39:27.457
What does that mean?

39:27.491 --> 39:30.200
It means Aceveda isn't gonna be gone
as fast as we thought.

39:30.240 --> 39:33.870
And six months from now,
he's gonna be our boss's boss.

39:37.183 --> 39:40.346
I can always tell
when you're lying to me.

39:41.855 --> 39:44.243
No, you always
thought you could.

39:46.654 --> 39:50.416
What were you and your father doing
on that street today?

39:56.188 --> 39:58.424
There's a flower store there.

39:59.611 --> 40:02.515
He wanted to go in
and pick up some flowers.

40:03.642 --> 40:05.813
For Jenny…

40:05.946 --> 40:07.768
his fiancée.

40:10.681 --> 40:12.697
Jeff was engaged?

40:12.730 --> 40:16.690
–What… Why didn't you…
–I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

40:19.032 --> 40:21.814
Dad told me once…

40:21.848 --> 40:25.610
how much you liked it
when he surprised you with flowers.

40:27.190 --> 40:29.873
He really got his life together.

40:31.253 --> 40:34.319
He was… happy.

40:38.676 --> 40:41.324
He was waiting for the right time
for us to tell you.

40:41.364 --> 40:43.152
Oh, what was stopping you?

40:44.531 --> 40:46.603
I don't know. You just…

40:48.818 --> 40:51.273
seem lonely…

40:51.441 --> 40:53.230
lately.

41:03.792 --> 41:06.300
I'm just glad nothing
happened to you.

41:06.382 --> 41:08.647
I lost my partner.
That's not nothing.

41:08.687 --> 41:10.955
I know. Thank you, baby.

41:11.118 --> 41:12.907
I hope she's okay.

41:12.941 --> 41:16.373
Thank you, sweetheart.
We'll do what we can for her.

41:17.069 --> 41:20.036
Um, let's talk
about this later, okay?

41:48.231 --> 41:50.816
No!

42:11.779 --> 42:15.277
I would've called. I just didn't have
the new number.

42:16.098 --> 42:19.226
You can't be here. Uh, tell Shane
not to come back either.

42:19.266 --> 42:23.127
I didn't send him.
He shouldn't have done that. Please.

42:29.887 --> 42:31.675
Thanks.

42:33.535 --> 42:36.374
We're not supposed to be
talking like this. You should go.

42:36.414 --> 42:40.044
I know. Uh, I won't come back again
without permission.

42:42.013 --> 42:45.716
I just was so worried about the kids,
spending time with them. I…

42:45.756 --> 42:49.301
I got lost somewhere
in all this.

42:52.955 --> 42:56.271
I never meant to hurt you
the way that I have.

42:57.978 --> 42:59.952
I'm so sorry about that.

43:04.089 --> 43:07.405
I want you to know,
uh…

43:07.576 --> 43:09.780
you're gonna be taken care of.

43:09.912 --> 43:11.570
The kids?

43:11.607 --> 43:14.709
They don't have anything
to worry about either.

43:18.838 --> 43:20.845
Tell 'em I love 'em.

43:20.982 --> 43:22.672
And, uh…

43:22.869 --> 43:27.093
call my lawyer and let him know
when a good time to see them is.

43:38.578 --> 43:41.741
Mama!

43:41.906 --> 43:43.695
Mama!
