WEBVTT

00:02.633 --> 00:04.635
(Mary Alice) ELI SCRUGGS

00:04.635 --> 00:08.679
WAS THE HANDIEST
OF ALL HANDYMEN.

00:08.679 --> 00:11.182
YOU COULD ASK
ANY OF HIS CUSTOMERS,

00:11.182 --> 00:13.184
AND THEY WOULD TELL YOU,

00:13.184 --> 00:16.587
THERE WAS NOTHING
HE COULDN'T FIX.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.392
WHETHER IT WAS A BROKEN VASE...

00:21.392 --> 00:26.057
A LEAKY PIPE...

00:26.057 --> 00:28.559
OR A SHAKY BANISTER,

00:28.559 --> 00:32.803
ELI ALWAYS KNEW
HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.805
BUT SADLY,

00:34.805 --> 00:37.308
THE MAN WHO HAD FIXED
SO MANY THINGS

00:37.308 --> 00:40.071
FOR THE RESIDENTS
OF WISTERIA LANE

00:40.071 --> 00:41.772
WAS NOW ABOUT

00:41.772 --> 00:44.075
TO BREAK THEIR HEARTS.

00:44.075 --> 00:46.347
ELI SCRUGGS,
GET DOWN FROM THERE!

00:46.347 --> 00:48.379
MRS. McCLUSKEY.

00:48.379 --> 00:50.781
JUST FOUND THIS NOTE
IN MY MAILBOX.

00:50.781 --> 00:52.783
SAYS YOU'RE RETIRING?
WHAT THE HELL?

00:52.783 --> 00:55.126
YES, MA'AM. IT'S TRUE.

00:55.126 --> 00:57.728
NOW WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO
SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT?

00:57.728 --> 00:59.730
MY DOC SAYS
I GOT A BUM TICKER,

00:59.730 --> 01:02.263
HAVE TO TAKE IT EASY
FROM NOW ON.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.465
WELL, ONCE I'M DONE FIXING
MRS. MAYER'S SHINGLE,

01:04.465 --> 01:07.468
I'M ON A PLANE TO WAIKIKI.
 WELL, THIS IS VERY ANNOYING.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.741
WHO'S GONNA FIX MY WATER HEATER
WHEN IT BREAKS?

01:10.741 --> 01:13.704
OH, I MET THIS YOUNG GUY
NAMED TOBY.

01:13.704 --> 01:16.707
VERY BRIGHT, JUST TURNED 30.
HE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

01:16.707 --> 01:18.209
AH, DAMN IT, ELI!

01:18.209 --> 01:20.711
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH STRANGERS IN MY HOUSE.

01:20.711 --> 01:24.615
TOOK ME TEN YEARS
TO TRUST YOU.
 (laughs) I KNOW.

01:24.615 --> 01:28.119
MOST OF THOSE GUYS LEAVE TOOLS
AND NAILS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

01:28.119 --> 01:30.121
YOU NEVER LEAVE A MESS.

01:30.121 --> 01:31.692
THANK YOU, MA'AM.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.864
HAVE YOU TOLD EVERYONE ELSE
YOU'RE LEAVING?

01:33.864 --> 01:37.198
I LEFT COPIES OF THAT SAME NOTE
IN EVERYBODY'S MAILBOX.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.869
WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

01:38.869 --> 01:41.702
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, PEOPLE
WILL WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE,

01:41.702 --> 01:44.575
AND... YOU KNOW, MAYBE THROW YOU
A PARTY OR SOMETHIN'.

01:44.575 --> 01:47.538
OH, NO. I PREFER TO GO QUIETLY,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

01:47.538 --> 01:49.540
I DON'T WANT A BIG FUSS.

01:49.540 --> 01:53.184
WELL, I'LL MISS YOU, ELI.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.686
THERE WILL NEVER BE
ANOTHER ONE LIKE YOU.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.892
WITH THAT, ELI SCRUGGS
CLIMBED HIS LADDER

02:01.892 --> 02:04.825
FOR THE VERY LAST TIME.

02:04.825 --> 02:08.859
AND ONCE HE HAD FINISHED
MAKING HIS LAST REPAIR,

02:08.859 --> 02:13.764
ELI SCRUGGS--
QUIETLY, WITH NO FUSS--

02:13.764 --> 02:17.408
HAD A HEART ATTACK AND DIED.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.673
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY...

02:22.673 --> 02:37.388
WITHOUT LEAVING A MESS.

02:37.388 --> 02:41.161
IT TOOK AN HOUR
FOR SOMEONE TO FINALLY NOTICE

02:41.161 --> 02:44.895
THE BODY LAYING ATOP
SUSAN MAYER'S ROOF.

02:47.638 --> 02:49.570
AAH!

02:49.570 --> 02:51.242
(brakes screech)

02:51.242 --> 02:52.703
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

02:52.703 --> 02:54.705
IT WAS
LESS THAN TEN MINUTES LATER

02:54.705 --> 02:57.878
THAT THE NEIGHBORS
BEGAN ARRIVING,

02:57.878 --> 03:00.211
EACH DETERMINED TO GET A LOOK

03:00.211 --> 03:03.214
AT THE VARIOUS PARAMEDICS
AND POLICEMEN

03:03.214 --> 03:05.716
WHO WERE ALL FRANTICALLY
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:05.716 --> 03:09.260
EXACTLY HOW
TO BRING THE BODY DOWN.

03:13.394 --> 03:17.528
AND IT TOOK TWO DAYS
FOR MY FRIENDS TO REALIZE

03:17.528 --> 03:20.901
THIS TRAGEDY
HAD AFFECTED THEM...

03:20.901 --> 03:23.504
WE'RE READY! COME ON.

03:23.504 --> 03:27.778
MORE THAN
THEY WERE WILLING TO ADMIT.

03:27.778 --> 03:29.940
HEY, GABY, DID YOU REMEMBER
TO GET CHANGE?

03:29.940 --> 03:32.943
'CAUSE WHEN I CASH IN MY CHIPS,
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY,

03:32.943 --> 03:36.247
"ALL I'VE GOT IS $50s."
 SPEAKING OF
CASHING IN YOUR CHIPS,

03:36.247 --> 03:38.889
ANYONE KNOW
WHEN ELI'S FUNERAL IS?
 OH, I THINK IT'S SATURDAY.

03:38.889 --> 03:41.722
I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE GONNA SHOW UP.

03:41.722 --> 03:45.756
MRS. McCLUSKEY WAS SAYING
HE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH FAMILY.
 POOR ELI. WE SHOULD MAKE SURE
HE'S GOT FLOWERS AT HIS FUNERAL.

03:45.756 --> 03:48.259
I'M IN.
HOW MUCH ARE WE TALKING?

03:48.259 --> 03:50.761
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, GABY?

03:50.761 --> 03:51.962
GABY?

04:02.873 --> 04:05.476
WOW! JIMMY CHOO!

04:05.476 --> 04:06.617
(squeals)

04:06.617 --> 04:08.619
(whispers) OH, CARLOS!

04:08.619 --> 04:10.651
(normal voice) THESE AREN'T EVEN
IN THE STATES YET.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.983
(chuckles)
 WHAT'S THE CATCH?

04:12.983 --> 04:15.326
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:15.326 --> 04:17.327
YOU NEVER BUY ME A PRESENT

04:17.327 --> 04:19.329
UNLESS I'M MAD
OR ABOUT TO BE MAD.

04:19.329 --> 04:21.492
AND I DON'T THINK I AM,
SO WHY AM I ABOUT TO BE?

04:21.492 --> 04:23.964
I HAVE TO GO TO CLEVELAND
TOMORROW.
 CARLOS!

04:23.964 --> 04:27.368
THEY'RE BEGGING ME.
THE MERGER'S GOING SOUTH.
 YOU JUST GOT HOME!

04:27.368 --> 04:29.470
WITH SHOES.

04:29.470 --> 04:33.344
(scoffs) DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.
I'M GOING OUT OF MY MIND.

04:33.344 --> 04:35.906
EVERYONE IS SO BORING
AND SUBURBAN.

04:35.906 --> 04:37.948
(sighs) AND HOW MANY
FREAKIN' HONOR STUDENTS

04:37.948 --> 04:39.810
CAN THAT SCHOOL HAVE?

04:39.810 --> 04:44.284
CAN WE PLEASE NOT ARGUE
IN FRONT OF THE HANDYMAN?
 HE HAS A NAME.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.587
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

04:46.587 --> 04:47.988
ELI SCRUGGS.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.860
YOU HEAR THAT, CARLOS?

04:49.860 --> 04:51.862
YOU'VE BROUGHT ME TO A PLACE

04:51.862 --> 04:54.565
WHERE PEOPLE ARE NAMED
"ELI SCRUGGS."

04:54.565 --> 04:56.567
FINE.
I'LL GIVE UP MY JOB...

04:56.567 --> 04:58.669
AND EVERYTHING
THAT COMES WITH IT.

04:58.669 --> 05:00.431
NOT THE JIMMY CHOOS.

05:00.431 --> 05:02.433
THEY'RE THE ONLY FRIENDS
I'VE GOT.

05:02.433 --> 05:03.974
THOUGHT SO.

05:03.974 --> 05:05.836
I'M GOING TO PACK.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.011
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS...

05:11.011 --> 05:12.883
YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT.

05:12.883 --> 05:15.546
BUT THE LADIES
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

05:15.546 --> 05:18.549
ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY NICE.
 YEAH. THEY CAME BY,
BROUGHT MUFFINS.

05:18.549 --> 05:20.751
ONE OF 'EM
WANTS HER BASKET BACK.

05:20.751 --> 05:22.793
(laughs) THAT'D BE BREE.

05:22.793 --> 05:24.795
ANYHOW,
SHE AND THE OTHER LADIES, UH,

05:24.795 --> 05:26.597
PLAY POKER EVERY WEEK.

05:26.597 --> 05:28.599
IF YOU'D LIKE,
I COULD TALK TO 'EM,

05:28.599 --> 05:31.602
SEE IF THEY'LL LET YOU
 HOST A GAME.

05:37.408 --> 05:40.371
HI. WE'RE, UM...
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.373
GABRIELLE INVITED US
TO PLAY POKER.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.480
SO... IS SHE IN?

05:49.480 --> 05:52.623
MRS. SOLIS
WILL BE RIGHT DOWN.

05:52.623 --> 05:55.386
SHE LIKES TO MAKE
AN ENTRANCE.

05:55.386 --> 05:58.128
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"AN ENTRANCE"?

05:58.128 --> 06:00.961
HELLO THERE.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.965
WELCOME TO MY HOME.
(chuckles)

06:04.965 --> 06:06.767
OH.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.569
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.970
SO I SAID, "PUMPKIN"--

06:09.970 --> 06:11.972
THAT'S WHAT I CALL
JON BON JOVI--

06:11.972 --> 06:15.005
I SAID, "PUMPKIN, EVEN IF
I COULD STEER A YACHT,

06:15.005 --> 06:18.008
I'M CERTAINLY NOT ABOUT TO DO IT
IN 5-INCH HEELS."

06:18.008 --> 06:20.050
(laughs) TRUE STORY.

06:20.050 --> 06:22.483
WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY HAD
QUITE A GLAMOROUS LIFE.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.486
WELL, IT WAS BEFORE MY HUSBAND
MOVED ME HERE TO EAST NOWHERE.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.018
(chips clink)
 SERIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU GIRLS DO IT.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.921
DO WHAT?
 GET OUT OF BED
IN THE MORNING.

06:30.921 --> 06:32.923
I'VE ONLY LIVED HERE A MONTH,

06:32.923 --> 06:34.925
AND I WANT
TO PUT A GUN TO MY HEAD.

06:34.925 --> 06:37.127
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
(laughs)

06:37.127 --> 06:40.130
NO, WE DON'T.
 THERE ARE NO GOOD NIGHTCLUBS,
NO THEATER.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.873
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A GOOD TIME?

06:42.873 --> 06:44.605
WELL, WE WATCH THE KIDS
PLAY SOCCER.

06:44.605 --> 06:47.508
AND THE SCHOOL DRAMA DEPARTMENT
PUTS ON SOME REALLY GREAT SHOWS.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.510
AND THEN THERE'S CHURCH,
OF COURSE.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.513
(laughs) CHURCH.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.046
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.

06:58.048 --> 07:01.652
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S QUIET HERE,
BUT I THINK YOU'LL FIND

07:01.652 --> 07:03.654
THERE'S A REAL CHARM
TO FAIRVIEW.

07:03.654 --> 07:06.156
NO, NO, IT'S CUTE. IT'S CUTE.
I GET THAT.

07:06.156 --> 07:08.028
IT'S JUST...
 (chips clink)

07:08.028 --> 07:10.731
I WAS A TOP-TIER FASHION MODEL,

07:10.731 --> 07:14.134
AND I GUESS I'M JUST GONNA
HAVE TO GET USED TO THE FACT

07:14.134 --> 07:17.007
THAT THE BEST PART OF MY LIFE
IS BEHIND ME.

07:17.007 --> 07:19.510
GOOD-BYE DOING VODKA SHOTS
WITH KATE MOSS,

07:19.510 --> 07:21.011
AND HELLO

07:21.011 --> 07:23.774
TO SIPPING INTERNATIONAL COFFEE
WITH YOU GIRLS.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.720
FULL HOUSE.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.826
YES?

07:35.826 --> 07:38.158
HELLO. IS MRS. SOLIS HERE?

07:38.158 --> 07:40.591
OH, I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO.

07:40.591 --> 07:43.634
MA'AM, HERE'S THE BILL
FOR FIXING YOUR SINK.
 OKAY. THANK YOU.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.135
BY THE WAY...

07:45.135 --> 07:47.568
YOU MADE QUITE AN IMPRESSION
AT THE POKER GAME.

07:47.568 --> 07:51.071
REALLY?
 OH, YEAH. THE LADIES CAN'T
STOP TALKING ABOUT YOU.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.073
AW. WELL, I'M SURE
IT WAS KIND OF EXCITING

07:53.073 --> 07:55.846
FOR THEM TO HAVE A STAR
IN THEIR MIDST.

07:55.846 --> 07:57.848
UH, LET ME THINK...
DID THEY SAY "STAR"?

07:57.848 --> 08:03.083
I HEARD, UH, "STUCK-UP,"
"OBNOXIOUS," "BITCH."

08:03.083 --> 08:05.556
(chuckles)

08:05.556 --> 08:06.887
WHAT?!

08:06.887 --> 08:10.060
YOU KNOW, I WENT OUT ON A LIMB
TO GET YOU INTO THAT GAME,

08:10.060 --> 08:12.693
AND THEN YOU GO IN THERE
ACTING LIKE

08:12.693 --> 08:16.226
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THEY ARE.
 OH, MY CLOTHES SAID THAT,
NOT ME.

08:16.226 --> 08:20.871
WELL, DID YOU ASK THEM ANYTHING
ABOUT THEIR LIVES?
 WHY WOULD THEY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THEIR LIVES?

08:20.871 --> 08:22.172
THEIR LIVES ARE BORING.

08:22.172 --> 08:24.875
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT'S
GONNA BE REALLY BORING?

08:24.875 --> 08:28.178
YOU SITTING HERE ALONE IN THIS
BIG HOUSE WITHOUT ANY FRIENDS.

08:28.178 --> 08:31.011
IF I WERE YOU,
I'D DROP THE ATTITUDE.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.043
LEARN TO LIKE
YOUR NEIGHBORS.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.717
WELL,
THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.719
YOU WANNA ADD THAT
 TO YOUR BILL?

08:38.719 --> 08:41.121
NO. IT'S ON THE HOUSE.

08:46.997 --> 08:50.961
I BROUGHT MUFFINS.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.005
THAT'S SO NICE.

08:55.005 --> 08:56.867
WE WERE JUST...

08:56.867 --> 08:59.770
PLAYING POKER,
AND I WASN'T INVITED.

08:59.770 --> 09:01.311
I KNOW. I GET IT.

09:01.311 --> 09:04.044
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU GUYS

09:04.044 --> 09:07.017
I KNOW I MADE
A HORRIBLE FIRST IMPRESSION.

09:07.017 --> 09:09.319
NOW YOU KNOW WHY
MODELS DON'T USUALLY TALK.

09:09.319 --> 09:12.022
BECAUSE WE SAY A LOT
OF STUPID, PATRONIZING THINGS

09:12.022 --> 09:15.786
THAT MAKE PEOPLE
WANT TO AVOID US.

09:15.786 --> 09:19.960
WHAT I SHOULD'VE SAID WAS...
MY HUSBAND'S NEVER HOME.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.733
I MISS THE CITY.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.564
I MISS MY LIFE.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.039
I'M LONELY ALL THE TIME...

09:31.071 --> 09:33.774
(voice breaks) AND I COULD
REALLY USE SOME FRIENDS.

09:38.048 --> 09:40.180
ANYWAY, HERE.

09:47.017 --> 09:49.319
NOW THAT'S HOW
YOU MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

09:52.963 --> 09:56.296
(cards shuffle)

09:56.296 --> 09:58.098
GABY?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.130
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

10:00.130 --> 10:03.774
WE'RE GETTING A WREATH
FOR ELI'S FUNERAL. ARE YOU IN?

10:03.774 --> 10:06.106
ACTUALLY, WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME PAY FOR IT?

10:06.106 --> 10:10.310
IT CAN STILL
BE FROM ALL OF US.
 NO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.082
I SORT OF DO.

10:12.082 --> 10:13.644
(chips clink)

10:13.644 --> 10:15.786
NOW LET'S PLAY SOME POKER.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.226
ALL RIGHT,
TIME FOR MY LUCK TO CHANGE.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.228
THIS HAND IS FOR ELI.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.230
HMM. NEXT HAND IS FOR ELI.
(chuckles)

10:30.230 --> 10:33.133
YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A GET-TOGETHER

10:33.133 --> 10:36.036
AFTER THE FUNERAL, WE SHOULD
START THINKING ABOUT FOOD.

10:36.036 --> 10:39.139
AND BY "WE" AND "FOOD,"
YOU MEAN BREE, RIGHT?
 I THOUGHT THAT WAS CLEAR.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.872
I'D BE HAPPY TO.
ANY SPECIAL REQUESTS?

10:41.872 --> 10:44.114
HOW ABOUT WE PICK SOMETHING
FROM YOUR COOKBOOK?

10:44.114 --> 10:46.146
GREAT. GABY,
DO YOU HAVE YOUR COPY?

10:46.146 --> 10:48.849
I'LL GO GET IT.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.829
YOU USE MY COOKBOOK
TO BALANCE YOUR TABLE?

10:58.829 --> 11:00.891
OH, IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY.

11:00.891 --> 11:03.193
JUANITA NEEDED
HER COLORING BOOK BACK.

11:05.335 --> 11:07.868
OH. (blows)
 (Gabrielle) ALL RIGHT.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.971
WATCH OUT, LADIES.
(speaks indistinctly)

11:23.053 --> 11:25.355
I'M SORRY IF THE FRITTATA
IS A BIT DRY.

11:25.355 --> 11:28.088
(Tom, mouth full)
ARE YOU KIDDING? IT'S GREAT.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.021
YOU SHOULD GIVE LYNETTE
THE RECIPE.
 YES, 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT

11:31.021 --> 11:34.024
WOMEN IN THEIR EIGHTH MONTH
REALLY CRAVE--MORE STOVE TIME.
 MINE IS SO ERRATIC.

11:34.024 --> 11:36.396
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
WHAT THE REAL TEMPERATURE IS.
 (chuckles)

11:36.396 --> 11:38.398
OF COURSE,
IF A CERTAIN DOCTOR

11:38.398 --> 11:41.101
WOULD LOOSEN
THE PURSE STRINGS...
 WE'RE NOT GETTING A NEW STOVE.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.734
IF YOU WOULD JUST TAKE ON
A FEW MORE PATIENTS,

11:43.734 --> 11:46.907
WE COULD AFFORD IT.
 WELL, IF I'M NOT SUPPORTING YOU
ADEQUATELY, MY DEAR,

11:46.907 --> 11:50.240
BY ALL MEANS, FEEL FREE
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
 SUCH AS?

11:50.240 --> 11:53.413
WELL, YOU COULD MAYBE...
I DON'T KNOW, GET A JOB?

11:53.413 --> 11:57.147
I HAVE A JOB.
I'M A HOMEMAKER.

11:57.147 --> 11:59.820
AND A DAMN GOOD ONE.
SO TO MAKE THIS,

11:59.820 --> 12:03.794
YOU--YOU JUST S-SAUTé
SOME HAM AND SOME ONIONS--
 IT'S NOT HAPPENING, TOM.

12:03.794 --> 12:05.155
I JUST SOMETIMES THINK

12:05.155 --> 12:08.158
MAYBE YOU WOULD APPRECIATE
THE VALUE OF A DOLLAR MORE

12:08.158 --> 12:10.160
IF YOU HAD TO WORK
OUTSIDE THE HOME.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.103
AND I THINK YOU WOULD APPRECIATE
 MY VALUE MORE IF, FOR ONCE,

12:13.103 --> 12:15.105
YOU HAD TO COOK YOUR OWN FOOD
AND WASH YOUR OWN CLOTHES.

12:15.105 --> 12:18.108
LYNETTE MAKES ME
SEW MY OWN BUTTONS.
 I'LL SEW ANYTHING YOU WANT

12:18.108 --> 12:20.110
IF YOU JUST STOP
GETTING ME PREGNANT.

12:20.110 --> 12:22.112
I WANT A NEW STOVE, REX,

12:22.112 --> 12:25.275
AND IF I NEED TO GET A JOB
TO PAY FOR IT, SO BE IT.

12:25.275 --> 12:27.277
IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR A STOVE,

12:27.277 --> 12:29.980
WE'VE GOT ONE
THAT'S HARDLY EVER BEEN USED.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.953
I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME
FOR MY UTERUS.

12:35.355 --> 12:39.159
OH, YEAH. I RUINED THE BRUNCH.

12:45.095 --> 12:47.097
HEY, HOW'S IT LOOKING
UNDER THERE, ELI?

12:47.097 --> 12:49.499
IS IT GONNA COST ME
AN ARM AND A LEG?

12:49.499 --> 12:52.002
NAH. A FEW FINGERS, MAYBE.

12:53.944 --> 12:57.147
HONEY, MY STOMACH'S GROWLING.
WHEN'S DINNER?

12:57.147 --> 12:58.448
OH, WE'RE HAVING LEFTOVERS.

12:58.448 --> 13:01.081
YOU CAN HEAT THEM UP YOURSELF
IF YOU WANT.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.383
SINCE WHEN
DO WE HAVE LEFTOVERS?

13:03.383 --> 13:06.156
SINCE I STARTED
WRITING MY OWN COOKBOOK.

13:06.156 --> 13:08.058
REMEMBER HOW YOU TOLD ME

13:08.058 --> 13:10.060
I SHOULD START MAKING
MY OWN MONEY?

13:10.060 --> 13:12.062
WELL, I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
ALL MY OLD RECIPES,

13:12.062 --> 13:14.064
AND I'VE GOT
THIS GREAT IDEA

13:14.064 --> 13:17.267
FOR A REAL HOME-STYLE
AMERICAN COOKBOOK.
 YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS?

13:17.267 --> 13:19.099
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

13:19.099 --> 13:23.033
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
COMPLIMENTING ME ON MY COOKING.
 YOU'RE GREAT, BUT COME ON.

13:23.033 --> 13:25.035
EVERY BORED HOUSEWIFE
WHO PULLS OFF A DECENT LASAGNA

13:25.035 --> 13:27.277
THINKS SHE CAN
WRITE A COOKBOOK.

13:27.277 --> 13:29.439
YOU THINK I'M JUST LIKE
EVERY OTHER HOUSEWIFE?

13:29.439 --> 13:33.113
NO. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING. IT'S JUST THAT...

13:33.113 --> 13:35.946
WHAT DO YOU REALLY KNOW
ABOUT WRITING?

13:35.946 --> 13:39.289
I'LL LEARN. AND I WANT IT TO BE
MORE THAN JUST A COOKBOOK.

13:39.289 --> 13:41.291
I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TRADITIONAL VALUES

13:41.291 --> 13:43.123
AND GIVE HELPFUL HINTS
ABOUT HOMEMAKING.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.225
LOOK, LOOK,
THIS IS MY FAULT.

13:45.225 --> 13:47.928
YOU KNOW, I-I WAS
RIBBING YOU THE OTHER DAY

13:47.928 --> 13:50.230
ABOUT GETTING A JOB,
BUT YOU TOOK IT SERIOUSLY.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.233
IF YOU REALLY WANT A NEW STOVE,
I'LL GET YOU A STOVE.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.069
NOW CAN YOU STOP
THIS FOOLISHNESS

13:59.069 --> 14:02.142
AND MAKE ME SOMETHING TO EAT
THAT ISN'T LEFTOVERS?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.244
MRS. VAN DE KAMP?

14:34.244 --> 14:37.247
I FIXED YOUR BANISTER.
SHOULD BE FINE NOW.

14:39.449 --> 14:42.052
I'LL JUST GO.
YOU CAN PAY ME WHENEVER.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.354
I KNOW THIS IS
A ROUGH TIME FOR YOU.

14:44.354 --> 14:47.287
THANKS, ELI.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.360
BY THE WAY,

14:50.360 --> 14:53.063
THE SERVICE FOR MR. V.
WAS REALLY NICE.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.668
YOU WERE THERE?

14:58.668 --> 15:01.231
(chuckles) I SAT
IN THE BACK OF THE CHURCH.

15:01.231 --> 15:04.334
I WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO MR. V.

15:06.176 --> 15:07.637
SO, UH...

15:09.379 --> 15:12.082
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO NOW?

15:12.082 --> 15:15.085
(chuckles)
YOU MEAN, WITH MY LIFE?

15:16.346 --> 15:18.488
I DON'T KNOW.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.293
MRS. V...

15:23.293 --> 15:26.456
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GIVE THIS
TO YOU FOR A WHILE NOW...

15:26.456 --> 15:28.258
(opens toolbox)
 BUT I, UH,

15:28.258 --> 15:30.260
COULD NEVER FIND
THE RIGHT MOMENT.

15:35.205 --> 15:38.368
I KEPT IT FOR YOU, JUST IN CASE
YOU MIGHT NEED IT SOMEDAY.

15:42.372 --> 15:44.174
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

15:47.177 --> 15:51.081
OH, I GOTTA TELL YOU.
I MADE YOUR CAJUN MEATLOAF.

15:51.081 --> 15:52.222
WHOO!

15:52.222 --> 15:56.226
THAT MAY BE
MY FAVORITE MEAL EVER.

15:56.226 --> 15:59.089
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SAVED THIS.

15:59.089 --> 16:00.330
AH.

16:00.330 --> 16:03.333
(voice breaks) OF COURSE,
I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD

16:03.333 --> 16:05.595
TO WRITE A COOKBOOK
RIGHT NOW.

16:05.595 --> 16:07.267
WELL...
 (closes toolbox)

16:07.267 --> 16:10.240
MAYBE ONE DAY YOU WILL BE.

16:17.447 --> 16:20.450
HEY, BREE, I KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN MAKE FOR THE WAKE--

16:20.450 --> 16:23.483
THAT FLAKY-BREADED-SHRIMP
THING.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.518
THANKS, BUT I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M GONNA MAKE.

16:38.528 --> 16:41.331
DAVE, IT WAS A NICE TRIP,
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU,

16:41.331 --> 16:44.434
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE SPENT ALL
THAT MONEY GOING TO THE BAHAMAS.

16:44.434 --> 16:46.536
IF WE'RE NOT GONNA
LEAVE THE HOTEL ROOM,

16:46.536 --> 16:49.239
THEN WHY NOT JUST COVER
OURSELVES IN SUNTAN LOTION

16:49.239 --> 16:50.610
AND HAVE SEX HERE?

16:50.610 --> 16:53.543
YOU JUST GOT A MESSAGE
FROM MRS. McCLUSKEY.

16:53.543 --> 16:55.345
OH?

16:55.345 --> 16:57.617
SHE SAID YOUR HANDYMAN DIED.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.320
ELI?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.691
OH, MY GOD.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.693
HE WAS
WORKING ON SUSAN'S ROOF

17:03.693 --> 17:06.195
AND DROPPED DEAD
OF A HEART ATTACK.

17:06.195 --> 17:08.198
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

17:17.207 --> 17:20.210
NO, NO, NO. YOU ARE NOT
 GOING TO THE GYM AGAIN.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.212
YOU SAID WE WERE GONNA
HAVE AFTERNOON SEX.

17:22.212 --> 17:25.375
WE'LL DO IT WHEN I GET BACK.
 YOU SAY THAT EVERY TIME,
UMBERTO,

17:25.375 --> 17:28.748
AND THEN YOU'RE TOO TIRED.
 MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE
IF YOU WEREN'T SO CLINGY.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.819
CLINGY?

17:29.819 --> 17:32.322
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN TWO WEEKS.

17:32.322 --> 17:34.524
IT'S LIKE I'M 15 AGAIN.

17:34.524 --> 17:36.186
WHAT'S WRONG WITH US?

17:36.186 --> 17:38.128
NOT US. YOU.

17:38.128 --> 17:40.190
YOUR LIBIDO
IS OUT OF CONTROL.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.162
UMBERTO--

17:42.162 --> 17:45.165
LOOK, YOU'VE GOT
A DRAWERFUL OF TOYS. USE 'EM.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.570
(sighs)

17:52.202 --> 17:54.204
(whines) OH!

17:57.347 --> 17:59.179
AHEM.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.680
OH!

18:00.680 --> 18:03.353
OH! ELI! I-I FORGOT
YOU WERE IN THERE.

18:03.353 --> 18:05.355
YEAH. I'M DONE FIXING
YOUR FAUCET.

18:05.355 --> 18:07.487
ACTUALLY, I WAS DONE
TEN MINUTES AGO,

18:07.487 --> 18:10.720
BUT I WAS AFRAID TO COME OUT.
 (sighs) I'M SORRY
YOU HEARD ALL OF THAT.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.722
THE GOOD NEWS IS,
WHILE I WAS IN THERE,

18:12.722 --> 18:15.225
I RE-GROUTED YOUR TUB...
FREE OF CHARGE.

18:16.766 --> 18:18.598
WAIT A SECOND.

18:21.631 --> 18:24.374
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY ASS?

18:24.374 --> 18:25.775
SORRY?

18:25.775 --> 18:28.608
MY ASS--
ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.241
WELL, I-I-I, UH...

18:31.241 --> 18:32.312
TICKTOCK.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.813
TEN. IT'S A TEN.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.315
(sighs)

18:35.315 --> 18:38.318
AND THE BOOBS?
PERKY AND FIRM?

18:38.318 --> 18:40.350
YOU'VE NAMED THEM?

18:40.350 --> 18:42.222
OH, COME ON, ELI.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.524
MY HUSBAND
WON'T HAVE SEX WITH ME.

18:44.524 --> 18:47.797
I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
IT'S NOT... ME.

18:47.797 --> 18:50.230
IT'S NOT YOU.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.731
ARE YOU SURE?

18:51.731 --> 18:53.733
TRUST ME. I USED
TO WORK IN CONSTRUCTION.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.306
MY BUDDIES WOULD'VE
GONE CRAZY FOR YOU--

18:56.306 --> 18:58.408
CATCALLS, UH,
NASTY GESTURES.

18:58.408 --> 19:00.210
"HEY, YOU,
WITH THE SWEATER MEATS!

19:00.210 --> 19:02.342
"IF YOU EVER NEED
ANY WORK DONE, CALL ME!

19:02.342 --> 19:05.475
'CAUSE I GOT THE PERFECT TOOL
FOR THE JOB!"

19:05.475 --> 19:08.548
(stammers)
Y-YOU GET THE DRIFT.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.381
YEAH. I DO.

19:11.381 --> 19:14.254
THAT WAS INSULTING
AND DEMEANING.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.725
OH.

19:15.725 --> 19:18.558
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:22.392 --> 19:23.863
(door closes)

19:23.863 --> 19:25.395
(chuckles)

19:28.338 --> 19:29.699
MISS BRITT?

19:29.699 --> 19:31.641
THE DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN.

19:31.641 --> 19:35.405
I GOT THE PAINT.
YOU WANT TO CHECK THE COLOR?
 EH.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.948
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

19:38.948 --> 19:42.452
(slurring) THINGS ARE GREAT.

19:42.452 --> 19:44.384
YOU WANT SOME WINE?

19:44.384 --> 19:45.615
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

19:45.615 --> 19:47.287
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

19:47.287 --> 19:50.590
I AM NO LONGER MARRIED
TO A GAY GUY.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.922
UMBERTO WAS GAY?

19:52.922 --> 19:55.325
SO YOU WASTED YOUR TIME

19:55.325 --> 19:57.327
INSTALLING THAT LIGHT
IN THE CLOSET,

19:57.327 --> 20:00.199
BECAUSE... (laughs)
HE WENT FLYING OUT OF THERE.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.802
AT LEAST YOU KNOW NOW
IT WASN'T YOU.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.674
WASN'T IT?

20:04.674 --> 20:07.277
HE SAID
THAT BEING MARRIED TO ME

20:07.277 --> 20:10.710
WAS WHAT CONVINCED HIM
THAT HE LIKED MEN.

20:10.710 --> 20:15.245
OH.
 YOU COULD IMAGINE WHAT A BOOST
TO THE EGO THAT WAS.

20:15.245 --> 20:16.586
(whimpers)

20:16.586 --> 20:18.448
COME ON.

20:18.448 --> 20:21.451
YOU HAD A GAY GUY SLEEPING
WITH YOU FOR TWO YEARS,

20:21.451 --> 20:24.454
AND THOSE GUYS ARE
PRETTY HARD TO LAND.
 (laughs)

20:24.454 --> 20:26.756
(laughs) NO. NO, TRUST ME.

20:26.756 --> 20:28.398
(sniffles)

20:28.398 --> 20:29.899
NO NEED TO BE SAD.

20:31.501 --> 20:34.264
YOU'RE A KNOCKOUT.

20:34.264 --> 20:36.766
(kisses)

20:38.408 --> 20:41.641
(sighs)

20:41.641 --> 20:44.314
NO, I-I-I NEED
THIS HAND BACK.

20:44.314 --> 20:48.418
IT'S HARD TO BE A HANDYMAN
WITHOUT A-A HAND.

20:48.418 --> 20:49.349
MM.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.281
(breathing heavily)

20:51.281 --> 20:54.324
MISS BRITT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:54.324 --> 20:57.927
YOU PUT THE MIRROR
OVER MY BED.

20:59.489 --> 21:01.831
YOU KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING.

21:03.293 --> 21:06.996
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS? I DON'T
WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

21:06.996 --> 21:08.798
(grunts)
 (gasps)

21:08.798 --> 21:11.301
OH,
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE GENTLE.

21:12.902 --> 21:15.505
(grunts)

21:15.505 --> 21:17.847
ANYWAY,

21:17.847 --> 21:20.380
I GUESS THEY'RE
BURYING HIM ON SATURDAY.

21:20.380 --> 21:22.382
OBVIOUSLY, YOU WANT TO GO.

21:22.382 --> 21:25.415
YEAH.

21:25.415 --> 21:27.787
I DO.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.659
(sighs)

21:29.659 --> 21:32.592
OH,
LEAVE THAT BLACK DRESS OUT.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.694
I'LL GET IT DRY-CLEANED
FOR THE FUNERAL.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.697
A LITTLE SEXY FOR A FUNERAL,
ISN'T IT?

21:39.329 --> 21:42.071
OH, I DON'T THINK
ELI WOULD MIND.

21:52.482 --> 21:55.345
(glasses clinking)

21:55.345 --> 21:57.086
(Penny) MOM?

21:57.086 --> 22:00.350
THAT'S PENNY.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

22:00.350 --> 22:02.091
MOM!

22:02.091 --> 22:04.424
HEY, SWEETIE.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.725
WHAT'S UP?
 (kiss)

22:05.725 --> 22:08.428
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
HELP ME WITH MY MATH.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.960
WE'RE DIVIDING FRACTIONS.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.904
OH. I WISH YOU'D CAUGHT ME
TWO CHARDONNAYS AGO. (chuckles)

22:14.904 --> 22:16.906
MOM, YOU PROMISED.

22:16.906 --> 22:20.770
I KNOW, BUT MOMMY'S
STILL PLANNING ELI'S MEMORIAL.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.472
START WITHOUT ME.

22:22.472 --> 22:24.914
I'LL BE THERE
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.789
(retches)

22:39.789 --> 22:43.132
(heaves)

22:43.132 --> 22:45.535
OH, MY GOSH.
LYNETTE, ARE YOU OKAY?

22:45.535 --> 22:49.499
THE DOCTOR JUST CALLED.
I'M PREGNANT.

22:49.499 --> 22:52.772
THIS IS FANTASTIC!

22:52.772 --> 22:53.943
YOU--

22:53.943 --> 22:55.605
YEAH. WHOOP-DEE-DOO.

22:55.605 --> 22:59.108
HONEY, YOU DON'T SOUND
TOO HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

22:59.108 --> 23:02.051
I WAS PLANNING
TO GO BACK TO WORK.

23:02.051 --> 23:04.884
WHAT? WHAT A--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.386
I HAD IT IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND FOR A WHILE,

23:07.386 --> 23:10.560
AND THEN YESTERDAY,
I GOT A PH--
 HOLD IT.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.693
(flushes toilet)

23:13.693 --> 23:16.996
SORRY. I WAS HAVING TROUBLE
PAYING ATTENTION.

23:16.996 --> 23:20.830
JEFFREY CUEVAS IS RETIRING
IN SEPTEMBER.

23:20.830 --> 23:24.133
I AM THE PERFECT PERSON
TO STEP INTO HIS JOB,

23:24.133 --> 23:28.478
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHEN
PARKER STARTS KINDERGARTEN.

23:28.478 --> 23:31.010
THE TIMING IS LIKE A DREAM.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.883
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR DREAM
OF HAVING A-A LITTLE GIRL?

23:33.883 --> 23:35.885
THIS COULD BE OUR CHANCE.

23:35.885 --> 23:38.918
OH, PLEASE. YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA
BE A BOY. IT'S ALWAYS A BOY.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.920
IT'S JUST GONNA PEE
IN MY FACE

23:40.920 --> 23:43.553
AND HIDE DEAD THINGS
IN MY SHOES.

23:43.553 --> 23:45.925
I AM DOING THIS, TOM.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.559
I AM GOING AFTER THIS JOB.

23:49.559 --> 23:51.531
(turns on faucet)
 BUT WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE
OF THE KIDS?

23:51.531 --> 23:55.935
(turns off faucet)
 WELL, I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
CUT BACK ON YOUR HOURS AT WORK.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.667
I CAN'T DO THAT.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.469
I HAVE A CAREER.

24:01.511 --> 24:04.574
YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT.

24:04.574 --> 24:06.215
NO, I-I DIDN'T. I DIDN'T.

24:06.215 --> 24:11.521
TOM, I CANNOT JUST
STAY AT HOME WIPING NOSES.

24:11.521 --> 24:13.653
I NEED IT FOR MY SANITY,

24:13.653 --> 24:16.455
AND I NEED YOU
TO BACK ME UP.

24:16.455 --> 24:19.489
(moans) OH!

24:19.489 --> 24:21.831
(rapid footsteps in distance)
 (boy) MOM?

24:21.831 --> 24:23.833
(sighs)
WELL, THE KIDS ARE UP.

24:23.833 --> 24:25.765
THEY'RE GONNA WANT
THEIR BREAKFAST.

24:27.236 --> 24:31.971
AND I'M GONNA BACK YOU UP
BY, UH, MAKING IT FOR 'EM.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.646
MY HERO.

24:36.646 --> 24:37.707
(retches)

24:37.707 --> 24:39.849
JEFF CUEVAS IS FANTASTIC,

24:39.849 --> 24:44.954
BUT I KNOW I COULD TAKE HIS
DEPARTMENT TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

24:44.954 --> 24:47.186
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

24:47.186 --> 24:49.188
(lowered voice)
OH, MY WATER BROKE.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.190
TAKE THE OVERNIGHT BAG
OUT TO THE CAR.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.192
(normal voice)
OH, THREE WEEKS.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.195
THAT'S A LITTLE SOON, BUT, UH,
SURE, I COULD MAKE THAT WORK.

24:56.195 --> 25:00.870
FOR GOD SAKES, LYNETTE,
WE GOTTA GO TO THE HOSPITAL.
 (lowered voice) IN A MINUTE. I'M
TRYING TO LOCK THIS JOB DOWN.

25:00.870 --> 25:04.033
(normal voice) WHAT KIND OF
PERKS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE?

25:04.033 --> 25:07.236
(gasps)
 OKAY, YOU'RE HAVING
CONTRACTIONS. THAT'S IT. YOU--

25:07.236 --> 25:09.178
(lowered voice) I SWEAR,
IF YOU TOUCH THIS PHONE,

25:09.178 --> 25:12.181
I WILL HAVE THIS BABY RIGHT HERE
AND THEN BEAT YOU WITH IT!

25:12.181 --> 25:15.615
YOU'RE INSANE.
WE HAVE TO GO.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.647
COULD YOU HOLD ON
ONE SECOND?

25:17.647 --> 25:20.219
(lowered voice) WE AGREED
I COULD GO BACK TO WORK

25:20.219 --> 25:23.553
AFTER I GAVE BIRTH.
 AFTER, LYNETTE, NOT DURING!

25:23.553 --> 25:25.054
I'M SORRY.

25:25.054 --> 25:29.629
IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD FINISH
THIS CONVERSATION TOMORROW?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.232
OH!

25:33.232 --> 25:36.535
L-L-LATER IN THE DAY
WORKS BETTER FOR ME, TOO.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.908
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:38.908 --> 25:42.541
BYE.
HEY. WHEW! I GOT THE JOB!

25:42.541 --> 25:44.844
CONGRATULATIONS.
THE BABY'S ARM IS STICKING OUT.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.246
WHY DON'T YOU HIGH-FIVE IT?

25:47.246 --> 25:50.580
(panting) TOM, I AM IN PAIN.
DO YOU MIND?

25:50.580 --> 25:51.751
OH.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.252
YOU'LL SEE, TOM.

25:53.252 --> 25:58.227
I KNOW.
PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU... OOH!

25:58.227 --> 26:03.162
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT ALL,
BUT I KNOW WE CAN. (panting)

26:03.162 --> 26:07.296
OH, MR. SWENSON, I CAN'T
TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM.

26:07.296 --> 26:10.169
MAYBE YOU COULD SCHEDULE
A STAFF MEETING

26:10.169 --> 26:12.872
SO I COULD HIT THE GROUND
RUNNING ON MONDAY.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.573
NO, NO.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.575
NO, IT CAN'T BE FRIDAY,

26:16.575 --> 26:19.578
BECAUSE, REMEMBER, WE AGREED
THAT WE WOULD START NEXT WEEK?

26:19.578 --> 26:24.583
(baby crying in distance)

26:35.194 --> 26:38.868
(door opens)
 SO AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

26:38.868 --> 26:40.800
(Eli) MRS. SCAVO?
 YEAH?

26:40.800 --> 26:43.833
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
FORGOTTEN SOMETHIN'.

26:46.676 --> 26:48.908
COULD YOU HOLD ON A SECOND?

26:50.209 --> 26:53.142
OH, MY GOD.

26:53.142 --> 26:54.744
OH, MY GOD.

26:54.744 --> 26:56.716
SHE'S FINE.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.718
(voice breaks)
I WAS ON THE PHONE.

26:58.718 --> 27:02.892
I WAS TALKING TO MY NEW BOSS,
AND I...
 SHE WAS ONLY IN THERE
FOR A MINUTE.

27:02.892 --> 27:07.727
BUT IT'S 85 DEGREES OUTSIDE.
I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

27:07.727 --> 27:11.300
YOU GOT A LOT ON YOUR MIND--
THREE KIDS AND A NEWBORN,

27:11.300 --> 27:14.363
IT SOUNDS LIKE A NEW JOB.

27:14.363 --> 27:16.035
YEAH, I DO.

27:16.035 --> 27:19.308
YEAH. IT'S A LOT TO HANDLE.

27:19.308 --> 27:20.940
THERE YOU GO.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.112
(coos)

27:23.112 --> 27:25.775
MM.

27:25.775 --> 27:27.977
(chuckles)

27:36.255 --> 27:39.328
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK
TO SUSAN'S WINDOWS.

27:39.328 --> 27:41.230
UH, YOU TAKE CARE.

27:41.230 --> 27:44.433
(Penny fussing)

27:50.299 --> 27:52.902
(man) Lynette,
are you still there?

27:52.902 --> 27:53.973
Lynette?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.404
Hello?

27:55.404 --> 27:57.877
Are you still there?

28:01.951 --> 28:04.413
HEY. YOU COMING BACK IN?

28:06.385 --> 28:08.357
NO.

28:08.357 --> 28:11.390
I'M GONNA GO HELP MY DAUGHTER
WITH HER HOMEWORK.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.462
HEY, PENNY! WAIT UP!

28:29.108 --> 28:30.409
(sighs)

28:57.506 --> 28:59.338
(grunts)

28:59.338 --> 29:01.871
UGH.

29:01.871 --> 29:05.144
YARD SALE!

29:05.144 --> 29:08.377
OH! GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.

29:08.377 --> 29:10.349
HOW ARE YOU, ELI?

29:10.349 --> 29:11.881
FINE. YOU?

29:11.881 --> 29:14.884
GREAT. YEAH, I HAVEN'T WORN
THESE JEANS IN A WHILE,

29:14.884 --> 29:16.886
AND I FOUND 20 BUCKS
IN THE POCKET.

29:16.886 --> 29:19.528
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE
WHEN THAT HAPPENS?

29:19.528 --> 29:21.530
ALSO, KARL LEFT ME
FOR HIS SECRETARY,

29:21.530 --> 29:24.393
SO I NEED YOU
TO CHANGE THESE LOCKS.

29:24.393 --> 29:26.265
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.467
OH, THANKS, BUT DON'T BE.
JUST HURRY.

29:28.467 --> 29:32.141
KARL SAID HE WAS COMING BY
TO GET SOME OF HIS STUFF,

29:32.141 --> 29:35.374
AND I WANT THIS PLACE
TO BE A FORTRESS BY THEN.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.146
YOU'RE DOING ALL RIGHT,
THOUGH?

29:37.146 --> 29:39.278
OH, WELL, ON ONE HAND,

29:39.278 --> 29:42.281
I GOT DUMPED FOR A PAIR
OF HEADLIGHTS NAMED BRANDY.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.984
ON THE OTHER, I REPORTED
KARL'S CREDIT CARDS STOLEN,

29:44.984 --> 29:47.987
AND I CUT THE POCKETS
OUT OF ALL OF HIS PANTS.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.990
SO A LITTLE FROM COLUMN "A,"
A LITTLE FROM COLUMN "B."

29:50.990 --> 29:52.291
(chuckles and grunts)

29:52.291 --> 29:56.165
OH. (laughs) SORRY.

29:58.227 --> 30:01.400
WELL, IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
REDHEADS ARE NUTS.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.072
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:03.072 --> 30:05.234
THAT SHE'LL MAKE HIS LIFE
A LIVING HELL.

30:05.234 --> 30:07.236
IT SOUNDS LIKE
WHAT HE DESERVES.

30:07.236 --> 30:09.308
BRANDY'S NOT A REDHEAD.
SHE'S BLONDE.

30:13.582 --> 30:17.917
SO, UH, YOU MAYBE WANT TO GO
WITH A DEAD BOLT THIS TIME?

30:17.917 --> 30:19.949
(thud)

30:19.949 --> 30:25.094
WHAT... DO... YOU... KNOW?

30:26.595 --> 30:30.329
I SAW HIM AROUND TOWN
A COUPLE TIMES WITH A REDHEAD.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.431
UH, PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
WERE TALKING.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.463
I-I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.

30:34.463 --> 30:37.066
I DIDN'T.

30:37.066 --> 30:39.068
WOULD YOU FEEL ANY BETTER

30:39.068 --> 30:41.410
KNOWING THAT, UH,
SHE'S KINDA CHUBBY?

30:41.410 --> 30:43.572
JUST LEAVE!

30:43.572 --> 30:45.444
BUT WHAT--
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LOCKS?

30:45.444 --> 30:47.476
I-I-IF KARL'S COMING...

30:47.476 --> 30:49.578
CHANGE THE LOCKS, THEN LEAVE.

30:49.578 --> 30:52.551
OKAY,
BUT I REALLY AM SORRY--

30:52.551 --> 30:56.125
CHANGE THE LOCKS,
DON'T TALK TO ME, THEN LEAVE.

31:01.330 --> 31:03.292
(knock on door)

31:03.292 --> 31:04.994
(Eli) SUSAN?

31:06.996 --> 31:08.998
SUSAN, DID YOU CALL ME?

31:08.998 --> 31:11.470
I COULDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE MESSAGE.

31:11.470 --> 31:15.304
(sobbing)

31:15.304 --> 31:16.645
OH, WOW.

31:16.645 --> 31:20.179
YOU WANT ME
TO COME BACK LATER?

31:20.179 --> 31:23.112
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

31:25.454 --> 31:29.088
NO. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.420
I HEARD YOU AND MIKE
ARE GETTING DIVORCED.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.062
I'M SORRY.

31:33.062 --> 31:35.364
PROBABLY NOT
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR,

31:35.364 --> 31:38.267
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A GREAT COUPLE.

31:38.267 --> 31:39.328
THANKS.

31:39.328 --> 31:40.930
SWEET.

31:44.333 --> 31:47.376
(sighs)

31:49.478 --> 31:53.142
DO YOU--MAYBE YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO DO?

31:55.114 --> 31:56.485
LOCKS.

31:56.485 --> 31:58.487
CHANGE THE LOCKS. GOT IT.

31:58.487 --> 32:02.521
LET ME GO SEE WHAT I GOT
OUT IN THE TRUCK.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.995
(sobbing loudly)

32:21.610 --> 32:23.512
SUSAN...
 (stops sobbing)

32:23.512 --> 32:26.215
I DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT LOVE.

32:26.215 --> 32:29.218
I... I DABBLED IN IT
ONCE OR TWICE,

32:29.218 --> 32:32.651
BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMED
MORE TROUBLE THAN IT WAS WORTH.

32:32.651 --> 32:36.455
I TOLD MYSELF
I WASN'T MISSING MUCH.

32:36.455 --> 32:42.361
BUT WATCHING YOU
ALL THESE YEARS,

32:42.361 --> 32:47.536
HOW...
HOW HARD YOU'VE TRIED, HOW...

32:47.536 --> 32:49.468
HOW HURT YOU'VE BEEN,

32:49.468 --> 32:51.470
BUT YOU STILL...

32:51.470 --> 32:55.044
KEEP GETTING BACK UP,
YOU DUST YOURSELF OFF,

32:55.044 --> 32:56.545
THEN YOU TRY AGAIN.

32:56.545 --> 33:00.409
MAYBE I AM...

33:00.409 --> 33:02.111
MISSING SOMETHING.

33:02.111 --> 33:04.683
MAYBE...

33:04.683 --> 33:07.156
MAYBE IT IS WORTH IT.

33:07.156 --> 33:09.258
(chuckles)

33:09.258 --> 33:12.521
AND, UM, I'M SURE
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP

33:12.521 --> 33:14.663
FOR YOU TO HEAR ME
TELL YOU THIS,

33:14.663 --> 33:18.627
BUT YOU'RE DAMN HEROIC
TO ME.

33:18.627 --> 33:22.301
YOU ARE.

33:22.301 --> 33:25.304
(sobbing)

33:28.377 --> 33:30.339
YEAH.

33:35.314 --> 33:39.088
HEY. JUST DROPPING THESE OFF.
I FINALLY GOT 'EM CUT.

33:39.088 --> 33:41.390
TELL JACKSON
I'M SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG.

33:41.390 --> 33:43.792
ACTUALLY, UM...

33:43.792 --> 33:46.095
JACKSON AND I SPLIT UP.

33:46.095 --> 33:49.098
WOW. I'M SORRY.

33:49.098 --> 33:50.399
AM I SORRY?

33:50.399 --> 33:52.361
OH, YEAH.

33:52.361 --> 33:54.363
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

33:54.363 --> 33:56.765
I JUST, UH,

33:56.765 --> 33:59.168
WANT TO BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

33:59.168 --> 34:01.340
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

34:01.340 --> 34:02.641
OH, HEY.
 MM?

34:02.641 --> 34:04.643
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,

34:04.643 --> 34:07.476
I THINK THERE'S A LOOSE SHINGLE
ON MY ROOF.

34:07.476 --> 34:11.080
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU COULD FIX IT FOR ME?

34:11.080 --> 34:13.152
OH, I'D BE HAPPY TO.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.083
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

34:15.083 --> 34:18.087
IT'LL BE THE LAST THING I EVER
FIX FOR YOU. I'M RETIRING.

34:18.087 --> 34:19.428
WHAT?

34:19.428 --> 34:21.489
TODAY'S MY LAST DAY.

34:21.489 --> 34:24.733
YOU CAN'T RETIRE.
I BREAK TOO MANY THINGS.

34:24.733 --> 34:27.696
I KNOW. YOU PAID FOR THE TRIP
TO HAWAII I'M GONNA TAKE.

34:27.696 --> 34:31.139
NO, IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE.
BE HAPPY FOR ME.

34:31.139 --> 34:33.472
HEY, I AM HAPPY FOR YOU.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.373
IT'S JUST, UH...

34:35.373 --> 34:38.407
THIS IS GONNA SOUND CRAZY.

34:38.407 --> 34:39.808
WHAT?

34:39.808 --> 34:41.810
UM, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN

34:41.810 --> 34:45.554
THE MOST CONSISTENT
MALE RELATIONSHIP IN MY LIFE.

34:45.554 --> 34:48.516
YOU'RE SO STABLE AND RELIABLE,
AND I JUST...

34:48.516 --> 34:51.420
ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU'D BE AROUND.

34:53.322 --> 34:57.566
WHICH IS FUNNY, BECAUSE I DON'T
REALLY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

34:57.566 --> 35:00.869
WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS--
I FIX YOUR SHINGLE,

35:00.869 --> 35:04.333
AND WHEN I'M DONE, YOU CAN
ASK ME ANYTHING YOU WANT.

35:04.333 --> 35:05.504
GREAT.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.537
I WILL GO TO THE STORE RIGHT NOW
AND GET SOME WINE

35:08.537 --> 35:10.509
SO WE CAN TOAST
YOUR RETIREMENT.

35:10.509 --> 35:15.444
I LIKE THAT. PERFECT WAY
TO END MY TIME ON WISTERIA LANE.

35:15.444 --> 35:17.616
OH, HEY.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.389
WHAT KIND DO YOU LIKE--
RED OR WHITE?

35:20.389 --> 35:24.323
EITHER ONE. JUST MAKE SURE
IT'S A SCREW TOP.

35:42.411 --> 35:46.715
ELI SCRUGGS WAS BURIED
ON A SATURDAY...

35:46.715 --> 35:49.718
AND ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ELI
HAD HELPED OVER THE YEARS

35:49.718 --> 35:53.722
CAME TO PAY
THEIR LAST RESPECTS.

35:53.722 --> 35:56.355
BUT ONE PERSON WAS MISSING--

35:56.355 --> 36:00.189
SOMEONE WHO HAD CHANGED
ELI'S LIFE...

36:00.189 --> 36:03.692
IN A WAY HE NEVER FORGOT.

36:03.692 --> 36:05.534
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

36:05.534 --> 36:08.537
HOPE I'M NOT INTERRUPTING
YOUR DAY.

36:08.537 --> 36:10.499
NOT AT ALL. CAN I HELP YOU?

36:10.499 --> 36:13.442
I WAS HOPING I COULD HELP YOU.
I'M A HANDYMAN.

36:13.442 --> 36:15.504
JUST MOVED INTO TOWN.
LOOKING FOR WORK.

36:15.504 --> 36:19.278
SORRY. I, UM, I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING THAT NEEDS FIXING.

36:19.278 --> 36:22.811
WELL, IF YOU EVER DO,
UH, HERE'S MY CARD.

36:22.811 --> 36:25.884
"ELI SCRUGGS."

36:25.884 --> 36:27.656
WHAT A DISTINCTIVE NAME.

36:27.656 --> 36:29.558
PEOPLE DO SEEM TO REMEMBER IT.

36:29.558 --> 36:31.560
SO IF ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS,
UH, NEED HELP,

36:31.560 --> 36:34.893
I CAN DO PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.
 I DON'T KNOW. UM...

36:34.893 --> 36:38.196
IF YOU HAVE A EXTRA CARD OR TWO,
I-I COULD HAND THEM OUT.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.469
OH,
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

36:40.469 --> 36:43.272
(grunts) OH.
 OH.

36:59.288 --> 37:00.519
ANYWAY...

37:02.621 --> 37:04.623
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.797
I HAVE A BROKEN VASE.

37:08.797 --> 37:10.499
I'M SORRY?

37:10.499 --> 37:12.501
I-I WAS, UH,
DUSTING THE OTHER DAY

37:12.501 --> 37:15.334
AND KNOCKED IT OFF THE BUREAU,
LIKE AN IDIOT.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.565
ANYWAY, I SAVED THE PIECES.

37:16.565 --> 37:19.368
IF YOU COULD GLUE IT
BACK TOGETHER FOR ME,

37:19.368 --> 37:20.669
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

37:20.669 --> 37:23.712
OH, MA'AM,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

37:23.712 --> 37:26.845
MR. SCRUGGS,

37:26.845 --> 37:28.817
I NEED MY VASE FIXED.

37:28.817 --> 37:30.819
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

37:32.521 --> 37:35.424
NOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE ME BEG, ARE YOU?

37:35.424 --> 37:36.885
(chuckles)

37:36.885 --> 37:39.758
NO, MA'AM, I'M NOT.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.590
GOOD.

37:41.590 --> 37:43.462
COME ON IN.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.744
MRS. YOUNG?

37:55.744 --> 37:58.347
OH. DIDN'T MEAN
TO DISTURB YOU.

37:58.347 --> 38:00.609
YOUR FRONT DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN.

38:00.609 --> 38:02.611
OH.

38:02.611 --> 38:05.584
ELI, I-I DON'T HAVE ANY WORK
FOR YOU TODAY.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.587
I'M JUST HERE TO DROP OFF
THAT HANDLE YOU WANTED.

38:08.587 --> 38:12.391
FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT MATCHED.
WANT ME TO INSTALL IT?

38:12.391 --> 38:14.823
NOT TODAY.

38:14.823 --> 38:16.465
OKAY.

38:16.465 --> 38:18.597
I'LL JUST BE GOING THEN.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.501
ELI, WAIT.

38:24.473 --> 38:25.904
WHAT?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.438
DO YOU REMEMBER THIS?

38:29.438 --> 38:33.612
(laughs) OH, RIGHT.
 THIS IS THE VERY FIRST THING
YOU EVER FIXED FOR ME.

38:33.612 --> 38:36.615
YEAH, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN WHAT,
UH, TWO YEARS AGO?
 YEAH.

38:36.615 --> 38:39.488
I JUST THAT GLUE REALLY HELD,
HUH?
 YEAH.

38:39.488 --> 38:41.490
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

38:41.490 --> 38:44.623
WHAT?

38:44.623 --> 38:45.924
WHY?

38:45.924 --> 38:49.057
I'VE JUST BEEN
DOING SOME THINKING

38:49.057 --> 38:51.059
ABOUT THE PEOPLE I KNOW,

38:51.059 --> 38:53.061
THE ONES WHO'VE WALKED
INTO MY LIFE

38:53.061 --> 38:56.505
AND MADE IT BETTER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE...
 OH.

38:56.505 --> 38:58.467
PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
 OH.

38:58.467 --> 39:01.570
ANYWAY, I'VE--I'VE--
I'VE NEVER SAID "THANK YOU."

39:01.570 --> 39:04.543
OH, NO, I'M--I'M THE ONE
WHO SHOULD THANK YOU.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.646
YOU--YOU INTRODUCED ME
TO ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.548
MY BUSINESS
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.020
I'M SO GLAD.

39:12.020 --> 39:13.922
YEAH.

39:13.922 --> 39:17.526
(voice breaks) ANYWAY, I, UH,
I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS.

39:17.526 --> 39:20.358
(chuckles)

39:22.360 --> 39:25.093
MRS. YOUNG...

39:25.093 --> 39:26.595
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:28.637 --> 39:30.539
(whispers) EVERYTHING'S FINE.

39:36.104 --> 39:39.678
ARE YOU SURE?

39:43.882 --> 39:45.984
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

40:19.518 --> 40:22.621
(siren whoops,
indistinct police radio chatter)

40:22.621 --> 40:25.053
SO I LOOK IN THE WINDOW,

40:25.053 --> 40:26.555
AND THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE--

40:26.555 --> 40:29.558
ALL OVER THE WALLS
AND THE CEILING...
 (woman) OH!

40:29.558 --> 40:31.560
NOT TO MENTION,
HER HARDWOOD FLOORS,

40:31.560 --> 40:33.802
WHICH SHE JUST HAD INSTALLED
LAST WEEK.

40:33.802 --> 40:36.665
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS THINKING.

40:36.665 --> 40:39.007
I JUST WISH THERE HAD BEEN
SOME WARNING,

40:39.007 --> 40:43.011
SOME SIGN THAT SHE WOULD DO
SUCH A THING.

41:05.133 --> 41:10.468
ELI SCRUGGS SAT IN HIS TRUCK
FOR ALMOST AN HOUR,

41:10.468 --> 41:14.643
DEVASTATED THAT HE HAD DONE
NOTHING TO SAVE ME.

41:14.643 --> 41:19.247
HE THEN MADE A QUIET VOW
TO GOD--

41:19.247 --> 41:21.680
FROM THAT MOMENT FORWARD,

41:21.680 --> 41:24.713
HE WOULD DO WHAT HE COULD
TO HELP PEOPLE,

41:24.713 --> 41:27.485
TO HELP THEM FIX THEIR LIVES.

41:29.658 --> 41:33.091
AND FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,

41:33.091 --> 41:36.625
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.

41:46.975 --> 41:48.777
THAT WAS A LOVELY SERVICE.

41:48.777 --> 41:50.508
ELI WOULD'VE LIKED IT.

41:50.508 --> 41:54.182
HELL OF A TURNOUT.
 WHO KNEW
HE HAD SO MANY FRIENDS?

41:54.182 --> 41:56.945
I'M NOT SURPRISED.
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

41:56.945 --> 41:58.647
I CAN'T HELP FEELING

41:58.647 --> 42:00.619
THERE'S MORE WE COULD HAVE DONE
TO HONOR HIM.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.691
WELL, LET'S JUST MAKE SURE
WE REMEMBER HIM.

42:02.691 --> 42:05.624
ELI WOULD HAVE SAID THAT'S MORE
THAN MOST PEOPLE GET.

42:05.624 --> 42:08.727
AND HE WOULD HAVE
BEEN RIGHT...

42:08.727 --> 42:10.559
AS USUAL.

42:17.235 --> 42:19.668
WAIT.

42:34.753 --> 42:40.789
I WANTED TO FIX SOMETHING
FOR ELI FOR A CHANGE.

42:47.565 --> 42:48.997
AND SOMEWHERE,

42:48.997 --> 42:52.300
IN A PLACE RESERVED
FOR THE VERY BEST OF US,

42:52.300 --> 42:57.175
ELI SCRUGGS SMILED
AND SAID, "THANK YOU."
