WEBVTT

00:31.949 --> 00:35.077
Of course, everyone will know.
They'll all be whispering.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.000
- Yes, happy New Year.
- So glad you could come.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.961
Thank you. Happy New Year to you too.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.797
I can't look at them.
I can't look at anyone.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.966
For God's sake,
don't glance into the garden.

00:48.966 --> 00:51.009
- Wha--
- Four hours.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.094
Till midnight?

00:52.094 --> 00:55.097
Until it's acceptable for us
to ask them all to leave.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.641
Did you really?

01:04.647 --> 01:05.941
Told you.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.785
Lord and Lady Brightlingsea.

01:18.328 --> 01:21.039
Your Grace, we're so glad you could come.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.625
Thank you for opening up
your beautiful home.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.669
And here's to a very happy New Year.

01:30.174 --> 01:32.092
Well, at least we're not
the most ashamed here.

01:32.801 --> 01:37.681
His father will be turning in his grave.
Marrying an illegitimate.

01:41.185 --> 01:43.395
Can you believe he's still marrying her?

01:44.313 --> 01:45.814
It can only be love.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.482
Or witchcraft.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.405
Maybe she's carrying a bastard of her own.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.658
I need to go find my friends.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.942
- There you are.
- Excuse me.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.152
I was starting to forget
what a friendly face looked like.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.573
I noticed you weren't getting
the best welcome.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.410
Must feel a bit foreign.

03:23.996 --> 03:27.291
I was hoping society might take my lead
in their response to Nan's lineage.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.419
I'm afraid not everyone's so generous.

03:32.129 --> 03:36.175
Well, lucky Nan, to have fallen for a man
so bighearted and charitable.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.761
And with the means to be able
to disregard her secret.

03:41.763 --> 03:45.642
I disregarded it because it doesn't matter
to me. Not because I can afford to.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.146
Of course. Financial worries
are irrelevant if you've never had any.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.986
No Jean this evening?

03:58.822 --> 04:00.866
So, how is Nan?
Hiding from all the high horses?

04:05.204 --> 04:06.538
Nan's with her friends.

04:09.208 --> 04:13.045
Good of you to be concerned.
But I know my fiancée better than you.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.088
Of course.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.716
Though I do know
the weight of feeling inadequate.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.553
Something else entirely unfamiliar to you.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.243
Hello, ladies and beautiful men.

04:44.243 --> 04:45.369
Hi!

04:45.369 --> 04:47.246
Welcome to our extravaganza.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.456
- Happy New Year, everyone.
- Cheers.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.919
Well, Lady Brightlingsea sure changed.

04:53.919 --> 04:57.422
You know, the joy of it all
is that she hasn't.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.343
- Conchita!
- No!

05:01.927 --> 05:05.389
Girls, can I help it if the party
organizers find me persuasive?

05:05.389 --> 05:07.349
I have to take my pleasure where I can.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.727
Can you think of anything
they'll hate more than this?

05:12.062 --> 05:13.230
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.523
- Yes.
- Cheers to that.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.083
Having fun?

05:35.711 --> 05:39.548
I am being treated like a stray dog
who you were kind enough to adopt.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.427
All I'll ever be from now on
is my father's shame.

05:43.969 --> 05:48.098
Not at all. In a week,
you'll be the Duchess of Tintagel

05:48.098 --> 05:50.309
and have all the legitimacy
and respect you could wish for.

05:50.309 --> 05:55.731
No, your legitimacy and respect.
I'd like some of my own.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.904
Well, respect has to be earned.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.283
I've worked desperately my whole life
to be the person people want me to be.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.077
I'm used to the whispering, of course.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.079
It's just until recently,
the whispers were...

06:11.788 --> 06:12.789
Admiring?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.711
Well, I'm sorry
if I've ruined your reputation.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.048
Didn't I make it abundantly clear
at Christmas that I love you?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.966
And that I've chosen to share your burden?

06:24.551 --> 06:27.387
So that's how you see me? A burden.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.224
You're deliberately misunderstanding.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.060
Why aren't you more grateful?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.898
Nan, you're forgetting that the minute
you revealed your secret at Christmas,

06:37.898 --> 06:41.151
- I immediately overlooked it.
- Well, how can I ever thank you?

06:49.326 --> 06:52.663
What have they done
to the house? It looks like a circus.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.959
Conchita has once again
managed to embarrass my parents.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.379
Jinny?

07:00.379 --> 07:03.632
Darling, no need to be nervous.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.802
I don't expect we'll get
a very warm welcome.

07:06.802 --> 07:09.137
Well, we can keep each other warm.

07:13.308 --> 07:17.354
And you'll always have me. Will I do?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.190
You'll do very nicely.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.282
I believe you're one of the Americans.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.909
I'm the original American.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.829
Well, could you advise your friend
to find somewhere

07:33.829 --> 07:35.539
other than the bathroom for crying?

07:36.164 --> 07:37.291
She's causing a queue.

07:41.378 --> 07:42.754
Thank you. Excuse me.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.306
Nan, open up.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.683
Are you in there? Nan?

07:56.518 --> 07:57.561
Nan?

08:05.736 --> 08:06.737
Hey.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.409
Darling.

08:15.621 --> 08:19.499
I just feel idiotic.
Of course, they're all gonna judge me.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.586
And they're not just judging me.
They're judging Theo.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.962
Well, we're not.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.131
You've got the right idea.

08:26.131 --> 08:29.384
Okay, Nan, we're not getting out
of this tub until you feel better.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.971
I tried to tell you about my mother
a hundred times.

08:33.764 --> 08:37.100
And I thought everyone finding out
at Christmas would be the end of all this.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.688
I suppose we've been so busy worrying
about husbands we've drifted far apart.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.535
We're not that far apart.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.953
Nope.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.831
Nan. No, never. Never properly apart.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.292
Oh, my God.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.422
We are busy using the lavatory.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.973
Oh, Jinny.

09:25.274 --> 09:26.275
Nan.

09:42.165 --> 09:43.166
How is she?

09:45.127 --> 09:46.128
Perfect.

09:51.049 --> 09:54.595
Hello. I've missed you.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.390
I'm glad they're back.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.312
Do you think Mother and Father
ever tickled us like this?

10:07.191 --> 10:08.400
I don't know.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.323
Can't imagine it.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.584
I sometimes used to pretend
Miss Testvalley was our real mother.

10:28.504 --> 10:32.799
It wasn't hard.
She did all the things a mother should.

10:38.055 --> 10:39.306
We never had that, had we?

10:42.059 --> 10:43.810
Perhaps that's why we clung to her so.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.187
- You the most.
- That's not...

10:46.855 --> 10:48.941
I found it all very confusing at the time.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.612
And I wonder if you did too.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.367
You were very young. Just a boy really.

11:01.119 --> 11:04.706
All those mornings
when your bed hadn't been slept in.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.917
It wasn't your job
to come looking for me, Honoria.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.757
It's okay.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.427
Hey.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.179
It's okay.

11:23.559 --> 11:24.560
Hey.

11:28.105 --> 11:32.818
I often think about that summer
playing hide-and-seek.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.448
You always used to give yourself away.
Do you remember?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.537
You'd get the giggles the minute
you knew I was near.

11:47.124 --> 11:52.212
But then she came,
and you stopped wanting to play.

11:53.589 --> 11:56.300
I don't think I saw you laugh again
until you met Conchita.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.526
Nan.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.740
Did you see who's here?

12:26.622 --> 12:30.918
Father, I was just saying to Virginia, all
these vultures ruining the floorboards

12:30.918 --> 12:33.629
just to get a look
at some disgraced nearly-duchess.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.256
Yes, very good.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.426
So, my boy, I want you
to do the first footing.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.473
But what about Richard?

12:44.473 --> 12:47.726
He's wandering
around like a lame duck or a girl.

12:48.310 --> 12:52.648
But we can't have him cross
the threshold first in that state.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.275
God knows what rotten luck we'll invite.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.110
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.032
I'll miss you.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.587
Sorry.

13:17.005 --> 13:20.509
- Mother.
- Darling, we were meant to surprise you.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.511
I thought you weren't coming
till next week.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.054
Well, that's the surprise.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.516
Now, where's Nan? I've missed you both.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.476
Mother, I...

13:31.311 --> 13:33.647
Jinny, what's wrong?
What's the matter?

13:36.441 --> 13:37.609
Jinny.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.240
So, everybody knows.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.368
But actually,
it all worked out rather well.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.996
Theo's a gentleman,
and the wedding is still going ahead.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.999
And actually, I'm sure Nan is happy
to have it all out in the open

13:51.999 --> 13:53.542
and to know how much Theo cares.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.003
So maybe it is all for the best.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.090
Maybe.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.719
Well, Jinny, you always did like to talk.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.598
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you, Mother.

14:08.182 --> 14:11.185
But we really did--
I really did think it was important--

14:11.185 --> 14:14.938
I'm not embarrassed.
I'm done being embarrassed.

14:15.647 --> 14:19.109
I never ever meant
to purposefully hurt you.

14:19.943 --> 14:24.740
But you purposefully hurt your sister,
and that breaks my heart.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.743
This is so unlike the Jinny I know.
I don't understand.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.120
Oh, Nan.

14:31.455 --> 14:34.458
What must this be like for you?
I'm so sorry.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.044
That's all right.
I've had my friends look after me.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.337
Sweetheart.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.380
In the absence of family.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.639
So, the duke still wants to marry you, huh?

14:49.473 --> 14:51.808
Mr. Good Guy.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.061
They're all talking about us.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.523
Well, we're worth talking about.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.441
You're happy, though?

15:05.155 --> 15:06.448
Guy.

15:07.282 --> 15:11.161
This is Guy Thwarte.
This is Theo's oldest friend.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.415
- Parents.
- No need. No, I'm nobody.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.876
- I'm delighted to meet you both.
- Likewise.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.212
Well, any friend of the duke's is a--

15:20.212 --> 15:23.549
Do you still need help with that job?

15:24.800 --> 15:27.344
- Yes, I do. Thank you.
- Yes. Okay.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.138
I'll see you soon.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.686
So, all's well that ends well.

15:37.312 --> 15:40.107
Tracy, she's pretending. We all are.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.536
You always know the best spots.

17:29.508 --> 17:32.010
Don't let the whisperers
make you ashamed of who you are.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.203
Mrs. St. George.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.915
Lady Brightlingsea.
What a very chic party.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.750
Too kind.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.335
Well, this time she--

18:05.335 --> 18:07.671
Colonel, would you be so good
as to fetch us some drinks?

18:07.671 --> 18:10.757
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.470
Just to say,
if the rumors are to be believed,

18:15.470 --> 18:18.765
the Earl of Leicester had
at least one cuckoo in the nest.

18:19.266 --> 18:22.311
Of course, the earl hasn't been seen
in public for over a decade.

18:24.313 --> 18:27.399
Aren't you brave,
showing your face, come what may?

18:28.358 --> 18:31.320
I do admire you Americans,
your lack of shame.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.031
Well, I have no shame.

18:34.656 --> 18:37.492
That's the spirit. Well done, you.

18:39.828 --> 18:44.541
Mrs. St. George. Welcome.
Would you care to dance?

18:45.626 --> 18:46.710
I would love to.

19:03.018 --> 19:04.895
I'm terribly sorry
for all the embarrassment

19:04.895 --> 19:06.522
that my family has caused you.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.735
You don't need to apologize for anything,
Mrs. St. George.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.404
And soon, you'll be
the mother of a duchess,

19:15.030 --> 19:16.532
so no need to answer to anyone.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.665
You must be exhausted.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.584
It's not easy bearing the weight of
someone else's cross.

19:28.502 --> 19:31.046
Whatever weight I've had to bear,
I have to remind myself

19:31.046 --> 19:35.050
it's light as a feather compared
to what's been forced upon Nan.

19:41.515 --> 19:44.935
I hope you know I'm not
simply marrying your daughter.

19:46.812 --> 19:48.021
I'm in love with her too.

19:50.649 --> 19:55.153
Well, that's all I've ever wanted
for both of my daughters.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.242
And for yourself?

20:04.121 --> 20:05.747
What did you want for yourself?

20:18.927 --> 20:21.889
Guess we'd all like to hide away up here,
of course.

20:22.556 --> 20:26.685
This constant drama, Richard.
You've learned that from your wife.

20:26.685 --> 20:29.396
Now, come on. Up you get.
Let's get you dressed. Come on.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.694
Come on.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.404
Mother, I need to tell you something.

20:37.404 --> 20:41.450
Can it wait, please? I mean,
they're out there pocketing the silver.

20:41.450 --> 20:44.703
Years ago, when you employed her...

20:46.830 --> 20:47.998
I had a--

20:50.125 --> 20:54.004
a courtship,

20:55.214 --> 20:58.675
I suppose, with Miss Testvalley.

21:01.178 --> 21:02.179
We were intimate.

21:04.723 --> 21:10.103
I believed we were in love,
but I'm coming to wonder--

21:11.396 --> 21:16.693
When I think of it now,
it feels confusing, to say the least.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.445
And...

21:19.404 --> 21:21.198
Is she asking for money this time?

21:25.786 --> 21:26.787
You knew?

21:28.455 --> 21:31.250
Who do you think persuaded her
to leave the first time?

21:34.086 --> 21:38.006
But you didn't say anything to me.
You didn't talk to me.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.427
- I'm your mother.
- And I was barely a man.

21:43.595 --> 21:46.557
Richard, mothers often don't talk
to their sons at all in polite society.

21:46.557 --> 21:49.351
I sent her away
before you could do something foolish,

21:49.351 --> 21:53.313
like proposing, which wouldn't
just have meant your name in ruins,

21:53.313 --> 21:55.357
it would've brought your brother
and sister down with you.

21:55.357 --> 21:58.193
Well, heaven forbid their lives
might have been any less blissful.

21:58.777 --> 22:01.238
I'm not gonna have any more
of this tedious wallowing.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.739
Now enough, please.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.493
You're a man now.

22:08.078 --> 22:09.746
Time to act like one.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.838
Splash some water on your face,
and I'll see you downstairs.

22:37.107 --> 22:39.943
...eight, nine, ten.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.369
Over here.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.007
Okay...

23:15.938 --> 23:16.980
I have no idea.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.321
Who are you?

23:25.531 --> 23:28.534
Funny, you don't know me
when I know every inch of you.

23:37.668 --> 23:38.961
First, you ruin Nan's life,

23:38.961 --> 23:42.256
and then you stand by
and let your husband humiliate me again.

23:42.256 --> 23:44.216
- Lizzy.
- I thought you needed protecting,

23:44.216 --> 23:49.137
but you are just as bad as he is.
You deserve each other.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.222
Lizzy.

23:54.393 --> 23:56.937
Every single person here
either has a rod up their backside

23:56.937 --> 23:58.230
or is laughing at us.

23:58.230 --> 23:59.565
Come on. Find your coat.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.817
- We're leaving.
- It's not even midnight.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.403
I don't care.
I've had enough of all the whispering,

24:04.403 --> 24:06.113
and everyone seems
to be avoiding me anyway.

24:06.113 --> 24:08.991
- I wanna leave.
- But what do I want?

24:10.284 --> 24:11.285
Excuse me?

24:14.955 --> 24:16.415
How the hell would I know, Patti?

24:18.125 --> 24:21.670
Have you ever asked? Even once?

24:23.297 --> 24:24.298
Do you even care?

24:25.465 --> 24:27.342
Please, can we just find our coats?

24:28.677 --> 24:29.845
I'm not leaving you.

24:31.555 --> 24:32.556
But Tracy...

24:36.185 --> 24:37.519
I believe I'm leaving you.

24:42.858 --> 24:44.985
Sweetheart, without me, you have nothing.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.447
Not true. Not anymore.

24:50.115 --> 24:52.534
Haven't you heard?
My daughter's marrying a duke.

24:54.161 --> 24:56.163
I'll be the mother of a duchess,

24:57.873 --> 25:00.250
with the kind of power
that money could never buy.

25:02.628 --> 25:04.087
The power to walk away from you.

25:07.007 --> 25:08.091
Okay, Patti--

25:10.093 --> 25:13.222
Look, we are both very tired
after an extremely long journey.

25:13.222 --> 25:16.350
We've had too much champagne,
and now this whole farrago.

25:16.350 --> 25:18.268
So, please, let's--

25:19.561 --> 25:22.397
Let's just get some sleep,
and we can talk tomorrow.

25:22.397 --> 25:23.524
No more talking.

25:25.526 --> 25:27.986
And no more pretending
to laugh at your jokes

25:29.029 --> 25:32.449
or turning my back every time something
young and pretty catches your eye.

25:34.201 --> 25:35.953
I have always deserved more.

25:36.787 --> 25:38.622
But I've always put my girls first.

25:38.622 --> 25:41.041
And no matter how small you made me feel,

25:41.041 --> 25:43.418
I made sure they were the tallest
in the room.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.005
And now they're letting me stand
on their shoulders...

25:49.716 --> 25:51.134
where you could never reach.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.432
Once Nan's married
and we get back to New York,

25:57.432 --> 26:01.436
let me be clear,
I shall be getting a divorce.

26:52.446 --> 26:54.823
It's my first time
seeing the New Year in from England.

26:57.576 --> 26:59.912
It's almost midnight.
You ought to find your fiancé.

27:03.290 --> 27:06.001
I got engaged
so I could carry on being me.

27:09.171 --> 27:13.675
So that's who you are then,
a liar and a disappointment.

27:16.470 --> 27:19.431
I forgot making others feel small
is your favorite pastime.

27:22.226 --> 27:24.144
I was fine before I met you.

27:25.103 --> 27:28.273
I'd never been under any impression
that I might be special.

27:29.024 --> 27:32.319
Never lied to by my parents
that I might one day be wanted.

27:35.322 --> 27:38.492
I knew my limitations.
And I had made peace with them.

27:39.952 --> 27:41.203
But then you arrived...

27:45.082 --> 27:47.125
and you made me feel so...

27:53.006 --> 27:57.469
I hate you for making me feel
like I could be loved.

28:14.027 --> 28:17.322
I was worried about you,
but I see your spirits have been lifted.

28:17.322 --> 28:19.783
- We were just up--
- Taking the view of the roof.

28:20.367 --> 28:21.535
Have you seen it?

28:21.535 --> 28:22.744
I haven't.

28:23.662 --> 28:24.663
It's quite something.

28:26.415 --> 28:27.416
I'll bet.

28:32.838 --> 28:36.842
Three minutes. Chop-chop.

28:37.509 --> 28:40.012
Collect your coats before the bells
and miss the rush.

28:40.512 --> 28:42.139
- Should we?
- You go ahead.

28:42.139 --> 28:44.641
I've remembered something I need
to discuss with my best man.

28:49.688 --> 28:52.858
So, the wedding...

28:53.650 --> 28:55.569
Well,
it's certainly related to the wedding.

29:00.449 --> 29:03.577
Specifically my future wife
and your inability to stay away from her.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.163
Nan and I are friends.

29:07.497 --> 29:10.709
You and I have been friends a long time,
in theory,

29:11.668 --> 29:14.296
and you never once sent me a telegram
declaring love.

29:21.803 --> 29:23.847
You've known all this time,
and you didn't say?

29:24.348 --> 29:25.349
That's right.

29:25.891 --> 29:27.226
I'm the villain,

29:28.560 --> 29:31.522
not the man sending love letters
to his best friend's fiancée.

29:32.564 --> 29:35.484
Well, it didn't work. She chose me.

29:42.199 --> 29:43.200
Did she?

30:00.092 --> 30:01.969
Here we go, everyone!

30:02.553 --> 30:05.264
- Ten, nine...
- Ten, nine...

30:09.351 --> 30:12.145
eight, seven...

30:13.981 --> 30:16.608
six, five...

30:21.405 --> 30:23.699
four, three...

30:26.493 --> 30:29.121
two, one.

30:29.746 --> 30:31.915
Happy New Year!

30:41.091 --> 30:42.467
Welcome.

30:45.929 --> 30:47.264
Stay away from her!

31:12.247 --> 31:13.248
Happy New Year.

31:18.003 --> 31:20.088
- He started it.
- You were throwing food.

31:20.088 --> 31:22.174
Are we five years old? What's happening?

31:22.883 --> 31:26.595
That telegram I sent you,
it didn't go missing.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.264
He read it and kept it from you.

31:33.018 --> 31:34.478
I thought it was for me,

31:35.270 --> 31:36.772
from my oldest friend.

31:36.772 --> 31:39.983
I didn't realize it would be so personal.

31:39.983 --> 31:41.735
But why didn't you give it to me?

31:48.867 --> 31:49.868
What did it say?

31:53.830 --> 31:55.499
- I don't think we ought to--
- Tell her.

31:58.043 --> 31:59.044
You want me to?

32:00.420 --> 32:04.091
No more secrets.
You should absolutely tell her.

32:09.012 --> 32:11.265
- Well, I hardly re--
- Tell her!

32:19.857 --> 32:21.358
I suppose it was along the lines of--

32:25.153 --> 32:26.154
"My dearest Nan..."

32:29.741 --> 32:30.868
"My dearest Nan.

32:33.996 --> 32:36.206
This past year,
I've learnt a lot about grief,

32:36.206 --> 32:40.043
but recently I can't quite explain why I
s--

32:40.794 --> 32:44.047
I so greatly feel the loss of you
when you were never mine to lose.

32:47.509 --> 32:49.761
I wonder if it's
because the opposite is true.

32:49.761 --> 32:50.971
That part of me...

32:54.808 --> 32:55.809
part of me--"

32:56.643 --> 33:00.105
-"Has."
-"...has always belonged to you."

33:08.447 --> 33:14.286
I suppose by that,
I meant my heart belongs to you.

33:17.873 --> 33:18.874
Keep going.

33:20.626 --> 33:22.628
"And now, because of..."

33:27.424 --> 33:30.719
"And now, because of my own cowardice,
I shall forever be incomplete.

33:39.019 --> 33:41.230
We were so close, Nan. Weren't we?

33:45.025 --> 33:47.778
But I can't rest for fear
that you thinking my walking away

33:47.778 --> 33:49.821
at Runnymede had anything to do with you.

33:53.408 --> 33:58.956
I am weak. And I'm confused,
but, Nan, my love for you is neither.

34:00.874 --> 34:02.584
But what started
as my father's stupid plan

34:02.584 --> 34:08.005
to save the house became an entangled
mess of guilt the moment we met.

34:09.341 --> 34:12.386
Because Nan, nothing about my feelings
for you could have been planned.

34:16.974 --> 34:18.308
You took my breath away.

34:26.859 --> 34:29.360
It does matter
that you were born out of wedlock...

34:32.447 --> 34:34.199
but only because it's part
of what makes you.

34:40.496 --> 34:42.040
And you are entirely perfect.

34:46.210 --> 34:51.507
Eternally yours, in the understanding
that you will never be mine...

34:53.927 --> 34:54.928
Guy."

35:05.689 --> 35:07.482
You read all of that in New York?

35:08.775 --> 35:12.696
- You'd already decided to marry me--
- You knew? About my mother?

35:14.031 --> 35:15.657
And you didn't say anything?

35:17.826 --> 35:20.829
Yes, I-- Nan.

35:30.964 --> 35:32.049
It's Richard.

36:20.764 --> 36:23.475
- Where to, milady?
- Pardon?

36:23.475 --> 36:25.978
- Where are you going?
- Could you just go?

36:57.968 --> 36:59.011
Nan. Stop.

37:00.012 --> 37:03.557
- Nan.
- How could you not tell me you knew?

37:03.557 --> 37:06.435
I told you, I told everyone how you came
into the world doesn't matter to me.

37:06.435 --> 37:08.562
- It's who you are I fell in love with--
- It matters to me.

37:08.562 --> 37:10.814
Didn't you think, if you were someone
I could have talked to--

37:10.814 --> 37:13.984
I've been terrified of you finding out.
I've been consumed by it.

37:13.984 --> 37:15.611
And you've known this entire time.

37:15.611 --> 37:17.529
I thought I was doing you a kindness.

37:17.529 --> 37:19.531
Doesn't that just sum up our relationship?

37:20.574 --> 37:22.993
Am I supposed to apologize now
for trying to be kind?

37:22.993 --> 37:27.039
It's not kindness. It's silence.
This whole country prefers silence.

37:27.039 --> 37:29.750
You're not some magnanimous duke
who forgave me the second you knew.

37:29.750 --> 37:32.503
You're a secretive duke
who stewed silently for months,

37:32.503 --> 37:35.547
never thinking it would actually help
to just say it out loud.

37:35.547 --> 37:37.174
So now you're blaming me
for keeping secrets.

37:37.174 --> 37:39.510
- I'm not blaming you, I was j--
- It wasn't mine to speak.

37:40.010 --> 37:46.642
What should I have done? Confront you?
Embarrass you? Or allow you your privacy?

37:48.101 --> 37:51.104
This was yours to either keep
or decide one day to share.

37:52.147 --> 37:54.858
I have told the whole world
that I love you unconditionally...

37:57.486 --> 37:59.321
but I will not fight for someone who,
deep down,

37:59.321 --> 38:00.781
doesn't want me in the same way.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.914
Which part of what was written
in that telegram

38:08.914 --> 38:10.457
are you really reacting to?

38:16.380 --> 38:17.673
Are you in love with him?

38:17.673 --> 38:19.424
This isn't about Guy.

38:19.424 --> 38:21.969
This isn't about you actually either.
This is about me.

38:23.554 --> 38:25.222
Isn't everything?

38:39.319 --> 38:43.031
Dick? What are you doing?

38:51.039 --> 38:53.083
I used to come up here when I was younger.

38:56.670 --> 39:01.967
When I felt alone or angry. So, often.

39:09.933 --> 39:15.606
I never should have brought you here.
Never should have let them near you.

39:15.606 --> 39:16.690
Who?

39:16.690 --> 39:17.774
My parents.

39:21.862 --> 39:24.114
They suffocate you with their silence.

39:27.367 --> 39:29.703
That's how it's always been.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.210
And I suppose back then...

39:39.004 --> 39:44.134
I just... I just wanted some noise.

39:47.596 --> 39:51.517
I'm so sorry about my family.

40:02.361 --> 40:06.573
It's okay. I'm your family now.
You're stuck with me.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.936
- Nan, I--
- Did you mean it?

40:37.938 --> 40:39.982
Did you mean what you said
in the telegram?

40:48.115 --> 40:49.157
Every word.

40:52.035 --> 40:53.203
I meant it then.

40:55.998 --> 40:56.999
And what about now?

41:03.505 --> 41:04.506
You chose Theo.

41:06.925 --> 41:08.051
That's not an answer.

41:14.224 --> 41:16.476
I moved on. I had to.

41:24.651 --> 41:25.903
I asked Jean to marry me.

41:27.029 --> 41:29.114
I think we could learn to love each other.

41:35.287 --> 41:38.957
You and I need to free each other
of this now.

42:00.729 --> 42:01.939
I'm gonna walk away now.

42:21.208 --> 42:22.209
Jinny?

42:23.126 --> 42:25.504
Where are you, Jinny? Jinny?

42:30.717 --> 42:31.718
Have you seen Jinny?

42:32.594 --> 42:34.721
Not since the bells, no.

42:47.776 --> 42:51.864
There you are.
What on earth were you doing outside?

42:54.241 --> 42:56.577
I was watching the fireworks.

43:00.247 --> 43:01.415
And how were they?

43:04.543 --> 43:05.627
Very far away.

43:23.854 --> 43:25.772
When was the last time you did this?

43:27.191 --> 43:29.026
Watch you smear meat on your face?

43:33.739 --> 43:34.740
Get in a fight.

43:39.077 --> 43:43.165
God. Not since...

43:45.667 --> 43:46.793
Henry Burton.

43:46.793 --> 43:49.963
- Henry Burton.
- Henry Burton.

43:53.717 --> 43:55.761
Still reckon I could have taken him
on my own.

43:56.887 --> 43:58.222
Unquestionably.

43:59.848 --> 44:01.517
Though he was pretty big
for a 12-year-old.

44:01.517 --> 44:03.060
He was enormous.

44:03.060 --> 44:05.646
- Close to six foot.
- More like seven, at least.

44:06.313 --> 44:07.814
I mean, six I could have handled.

44:16.323 --> 44:17.866
You always looked out for me.

44:22.913 --> 44:26.458
And I was wrong to send that telegram.

44:27.793 --> 44:33.298
So wrong, and... so drunk.

44:40.848 --> 44:43.392
I should have come to you instead,
and I didn't.
