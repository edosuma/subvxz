WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.235
Only on Fox.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.540
Narrator:
Previously...

00:06.574 --> 00:09.076
Please welcome one of America's
greatest soccer players.

00:09.109 --> 00:10.711
Alexi Lalas?

00:10.744 --> 00:12.580
Are we playing soccer
or are we cooking over here?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.414
Narrator:
A world-class challenge....

00:14.447 --> 00:16.483
Gordon:
Churros.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.218
...meant sweet success...

00:18.251 --> 00:20.053
- These are kinda sexy.
- ...for some...

00:20.087 --> 00:22.222
That's textbook, spot-on.

00:22.255 --> 00:24.357
- ...but...
- This is your worst
performance.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.659
...it was the end
of the road...

00:25.693 --> 00:28.261
Please, place your apron
on your bench.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.363
...for Alecia.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.669
- Tonight...
- Please welcome Shaun O'Neale.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.906
a champion returns
for a MasterChef wedding.

00:38.939 --> 00:41.875
It is my honor to declare you
husband and wife.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.044
( cheers and applause )

00:44.077 --> 00:46.346
- But...
- Imagine if it was
your wedding day.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.749
- That's how we gotta work.
- ...when the top 18
join together

00:48.782 --> 00:51.752
- for better or worse...
- Beautiful.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.688
- You wanna serve this
( bleep ).
- the celebration...

00:54.722 --> 00:57.625
- MasterChef mashed potatoes.
- ...ends in heartbreak.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.360
You are not gonna captain
this team any longer.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.095
I'm gonna run it.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.805
- Whoo!
- This is so beautiful!

01:11.839 --> 01:14.141
Oh, my God!

01:14.174 --> 01:15.643
Top 18!

01:15.676 --> 01:17.778
I am hyped right now.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.579
We are riding in a safari truck

01:19.613 --> 01:22.149
and I don't know
what we're doing,

01:22.182 --> 01:24.785
- I don't know
where we're going.
- How amazing is he?

01:24.818 --> 01:26.620
His name is Stanley.
He's nine years old.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.255
Aarón:
Come on, Stanley.

01:28.288 --> 01:31.058
You got all dressed up
for the party. Look at him.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.794
There's obviously
vineyards here,

01:33.827 --> 01:36.096
but then I look to my left
and there's a zebra,

01:36.129 --> 01:38.598
and then I look to my right
and there's a giraffe.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.734
- Good morning!
- Good morning, good morning.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.069
We see the arch,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.804
we see tents,

01:43.837 --> 01:45.272
we see flowers everywhere.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.174
So an environment

01:47.207 --> 01:49.743
reminiscent of
an outdoor wedding.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.912
Welcome to Saddlerock Ranch.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.648
- Are you excited?
- All: Yes, Chef.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.250
As you can see,
you are at a wedding!

01:57.284 --> 01:59.820
- ( all cheer )
- Right?

01:59.853 --> 02:02.289
And can you guess
who today's cooks are?

02:02.322 --> 02:03.490
- Us.
- Us.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.759
Yes, you got it.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.360
It is all of you guys.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.296
Today's not just
anyone's wedding.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.931
It's somebody
that's very important

02:10.964 --> 02:12.165
to our MasterChef family.

02:12.199 --> 02:14.434
Gordon:
All of you, please welcome

02:14.467 --> 02:18.806
the winner of "MasterChef"
season seven, Shaun O'Neale,

02:18.839 --> 02:22.342
and his fiancée Katie.

02:22.375 --> 02:23.944
( cheers and applause )

02:23.977 --> 02:25.846
What's up, guys?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.715
Yeah!

02:27.748 --> 02:32.352
Being able to cook
at Shaun's wedding

02:32.385 --> 02:34.888
is an incredible honor.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.490
- Chef Ramsay, great to see you.
- Welcome back.

02:37.524 --> 02:40.127
But I also know how great
of a chef he is

02:40.160 --> 02:42.896
and I know what kind
of expectations he has,

02:42.930 --> 02:45.332
so this is gonna be hardcore.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.235
- Shaun, welcome back
to the MasterChef family.
- Thank you, Chef. Thank you.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.870
Give us an insight
to what you've been up to.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.905
I've been cooking at some
of the biggest

02:51.939 --> 02:53.907
food festivals
in the country,

02:53.941 --> 02:55.876
but the biggest change
in my life

02:55.909 --> 02:58.478
has been finding
my future wife.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.581
All right, guys, you're gonna
be working in two teams.

03:01.614 --> 03:05.152
Both teams will be making
a stunning appetizer,

03:05.185 --> 03:07.988
followed by
an incredible entrée.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.557
But the proteins
they'll be cooking with

03:10.590 --> 03:12.059
will be up to both of you.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.660
So, Shaun, Katie,

03:13.693 --> 03:16.529
give us an insight
to what you'd love to see.

03:16.563 --> 03:18.899
For the appetizer,
we would really like scallops

03:18.932 --> 03:20.567
to be featured.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.936
For our very first date,
Shaun made me scallops.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.105
- How good were they?
- Katie: Amazing.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.506
- Amazing.
- We're here now.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.708
- ( all laugh )
- That's why.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.043
And what will
the entrée protein be?

03:30.077 --> 03:31.244
Duck breast.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.880
- Duck. Yes.
- Wow!

03:32.913 --> 03:35.548
Shaun: It's a tricky ingredient,
but if made right,

03:35.582 --> 03:37.785
there is truly nothing else
like it.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.419
Don't mess this up.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.021
I expect perfection.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.555
It's an absolute pleasure,
and for me,

03:42.589 --> 03:44.624
seeing where you started
standing there,

03:44.657 --> 03:47.394
to be hosting
your wedding today,

03:47.427 --> 03:51.264
I can't think of a better way
to put these guys to the test.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.900
Now go and get ready.
Next time we see you,

03:52.933 --> 03:55.568
- you'll be husband and wife.
- Thank you, Chef.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.771
We'll see you guys soon.
Bye, guys.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.773
Kick some ass.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.975
Julia:
This is a pretty big deal
right now, you know.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.577
This isn't about just cooking
a kitchen and winning
a competition.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.547
This is somebody's getting
married over here.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.416
Like, this stuff has got
to be good today.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.484
Today we're gonna elect
two home cooks

04:11.518 --> 04:13.253
that have been flying
under the radar.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.790
We wanna see what you can do
in a position of leadership.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.259
Juni.
Come on up here.

04:19.292 --> 04:20.794
You'll be the red team captain.

04:20.828 --> 04:23.130
( cheers and applause )

04:23.163 --> 04:27.434
The blue team captain today
will be Julia.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.903
- Oh, nice!
- Come on, Julia!

04:29.937 --> 04:31.438
Lindsay:
Juni and Julia.

04:31.471 --> 04:33.773
You couldn't ask for two
different personalities.

04:33.807 --> 04:37.610
I mean, Juni's a little bit all
over the place, pretty young,

04:37.644 --> 04:39.746
and I think
a little bit flighty.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.182
And Julia's got a very loud
and strong voice.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.617
I mean, she knows what she
wants and she's gonna get it.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.287
Joe:
Okay, Julia, first pick.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.789
Okay.

04:49.823 --> 04:53.093
This person to me
is just very strong,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.795
and they work really
well under pressure.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.164
That person is Lindsay.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.999
Gordon:
Lindsay. Wow.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.469
Old ladies gotta
stick together.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.604
- Uh, Juni.
- This home cook,

05:04.637 --> 05:08.308
I believe that their execution
of their dishes
has been phenomenal

05:08.341 --> 05:09.877
and so I am choosing Cesar.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.945
Gordon:
Cesar. Wow.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.280
Thank you.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.347
S.J.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.385
My strategy with picking
my team,

05:18.418 --> 05:20.120
is first of all, no drama.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.721
Taylor.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.690
Secondly, they need
to be a team player.

05:23.723 --> 05:24.724
Ashley.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.827
Juni:
I want a strong team

05:27.861 --> 05:29.362
that's going to be able
to work together.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.564
Mark.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.166
Somebody that's going
to be able

05:33.200 --> 05:34.534
to really step up to the plate.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.869
Farhan.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.339
They can't buckle
under pressure.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.673
I don't want no freaking crying.

05:40.707 --> 05:43.476
- Ralph.
- Let's go, Julia!

05:43.510 --> 05:46.146
- Gerron.
- Gerron.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.647
Julia:
I do pay attention
to people's strengths,

05:47.680 --> 05:49.883
and I want that strength
in my team.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.851
Bowen.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.657
- Juni. Three left.
- Yes. Three left.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.726
Gordon:
Think about this one carefully.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.529
Who don't you want?

06:02.562 --> 06:03.897
- Who don't I want?
- Yeah.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.098
Uh, Miss Shanika.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.733
- ( chuckles )
- Why?

06:06.766 --> 06:08.368
I don't like her
in the kitchen.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.603
- I like her outside
of the kitchen.
- Ooh.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.105
Really, Juni?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.606
I'm choosing Samantha.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.408
Gordon:
Samantha. Wow.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.609
Shanika:
You're gonna eat those words,

06:16.643 --> 06:18.545
because when you see me
in action,

06:18.578 --> 06:20.948
you'll see exactly
what I'm capable of doing.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.215
I would love to have Shanika.

06:22.249 --> 06:25.785
- Thank you.
- All right.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.587
- The red team's
going down today.
- Yes.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.556
- Okay.
- I have the dream team.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.724
I have everybody
that I wanted to work with.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.260
I have confidence that

06:33.293 --> 06:34.928
they'll be able to knock this
out of the park.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.766
Juni, are you happy
with your team?

06:39.799 --> 06:42.235
- I'm excited. Yes, we are.
- You're gonna win this today.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.372
- Julia.
- I am feeling wonderful
about my team.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.375
Honestly, I think
I have the most mature team.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.411
- Right.
- And those are people
that I prefer to work with.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.981
All right, so everybody's
happy on both teams.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.049
A hundred percent happy,
that's an amazing thing,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.651
but... too bad.

06:58.685 --> 07:00.220
Told ya.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.255
Because right now,

07:02.289 --> 07:04.791
I would like
the team captains...

07:04.824 --> 07:06.994
- to switch aprons.
- Oh!

07:07.027 --> 07:09.162
Hell nah.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.798
Joe:
So, Juni, you will captain
the blue team.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.566
( sighs )
I knew it!

07:13.600 --> 07:16.503
And, Julia, you will captain
the red team.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.271
Oh, my God!

07:18.305 --> 07:20.273
A great chef and a great leader

07:20.307 --> 07:22.609
should be able
to work with anyone.

07:22.642 --> 07:25.178
Today we'll be judging based
upon guest feedback,

07:25.212 --> 07:27.147
obviously how well you work
in the kitchen,

07:27.180 --> 07:28.915
and of course,
the dishes you plate,

07:28.948 --> 07:30.583
to determine who wins

07:30.617 --> 07:34.654
and which team faces
elimination.

07:34.687 --> 07:37.324
- Are you both ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.259
Your time starts now!

07:39.292 --> 07:41.528
- Let's go, guys!
- Go! Go! Go!

07:41.561 --> 07:43.296
- Come on, guys.
- Let's go, guys. Let's go.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.797
- Team blue.
- Let's go! Let's go!

07:44.831 --> 07:46.833
Okay, listen.

07:46.866 --> 07:48.835
For the scallops,
I think we should
do three of them.

07:48.868 --> 07:50.603
- Are we all in agreement?
- Yeah. Absolutely, yes.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.605
I think underneath we should
probably do some lentils,

07:52.639 --> 07:55.042
lke something in like
a really nice vinaigrette.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.643
I was just going
in a complete
other direction,

07:56.676 --> 07:58.878
but like a watercress salad,
blood orange supremes,

07:58.911 --> 08:01.614
- some crispy sprouts on top,
basil oil.
- But all those components,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.283
I don't know
if we're gonna have time.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.817
I'm a little worried.
I got this team,

08:04.851 --> 08:06.386
that I didn't even pick.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.987
They're really, really young,

08:08.021 --> 08:09.489
and they all think
they know everything.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.191
I don't wanna be told

08:11.224 --> 08:13.293
this is how we're supposed
to do it. I'm in charge.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.129
As far as the duck,
I wanna do something classic

08:16.163 --> 08:18.631
like a red wine reduction.
I mean, we're in a vineyard.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.567
- Gerron: I like that.
I like that.
- All right.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.235
- Everybody knows
what they're doing?
- Yes.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.570
- We can do this.
- All right, let's go, guys.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.238
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

08:25.272 --> 08:27.374
I need everybody up here
who's gonna be doing scallops.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.909
I've decided that we're gonna
do seared scallops

08:29.942 --> 08:33.046
over a bed of lentils
with bacon,

08:33.080 --> 08:35.048
and nice little salad on top.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.317
Snap peas
with some red radishes

08:37.350 --> 08:39.352
in a nice champagne
vinaigrette.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.222
So the duck, we decided on
just nice roasted potatoes,

08:42.255 --> 08:43.890
putting some mushrooms
in there.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.226
We're gonna do a cherry
red wine sauce.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.061
Cherries and duck,
it's classic.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.996
So we're gonna pan sear
the scallops.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.031
Do you guys think that we should
pan sear them in duck fat,

08:52.065 --> 08:54.867
- to kinda tie the two dishes
together or--
- All: No.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.503
- Okay, okay.
- They're too delicate.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.271
As a vegetarian
of over ten years,

08:58.305 --> 09:00.540
I don't cook with scallops,
I don't cook with duck,

09:00.573 --> 09:03.243
but I'm confident
in my ability

09:03.276 --> 09:05.378
to cook anything
that's put in front of me.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.747
Got it, okay.
So, pan-seared scallops, uh,

09:07.780 --> 09:10.016
- with some farro.
- I think we probably
should go with duck.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.185
Yeah, I think we probably
should go with the duck.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.354
Taylor:
Right off the bat
I'm a little worried.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.456
If this were my wedding,
I would not want

09:16.489 --> 09:18.125
to eat farro with scallops.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.393
I just know I don't want
to eat a kind of grain.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.861
I think for the entrée,

09:21.894 --> 09:24.197
I am thinking of doing
a pan-seared duck breast...

09:24.231 --> 09:26.633
- Yes.
- ...with orange zest,
mashed potatoes.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.102
Mm... mm-mm.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.304
Juni, you're not
making sense right now.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.273
Freaking orange
mashed potatoes?

09:33.306 --> 09:34.874
Who does that?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.943
- Everybody got it? All right.
- Are we ready?

09:36.976 --> 09:38.245
One, two, three.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.779
- Blue team!
- Whoo!

09:39.812 --> 09:40.813
Let's go!

09:42.615 --> 09:44.251
Juni:
So for the appetizer,

09:44.284 --> 09:46.486
we're gonna be doing
a pan-seared scallop

09:46.519 --> 09:50.056
with some farro, blood orange
gastrique, and orange supremes.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.059
For the entrée, we're gonna go
with the pan-seared duck breast

09:53.092 --> 09:55.094
with orange zest mash,

09:55.128 --> 09:57.464
and we're gonna do
a cherry red wine reduction

09:57.497 --> 09:59.299
and some charred Romanesco.

09:59.332 --> 10:01.901
I'm confident
that we can execute some dishes

10:01.934 --> 10:03.170
to perfection today.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.604
Shanika:
We got this, y'all.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.173
We got this.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.208
( music playing )

10:10.443 --> 10:12.645
Gordon:
Red team, blue team,
our guests are arriving.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.918
I'm looking forward
to the food,

10:18.951 --> 10:20.520
because I-- I'm praying

10:20.553 --> 10:21.821
that it's gonna be delicious.

10:21.854 --> 10:23.590
It better be delicious!

10:23.623 --> 10:25.124
Imagine if it was
your wedding day.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.626
That's how we gotta work.

10:26.659 --> 10:29.296
I have the highest expectations,

10:29.329 --> 10:31.130
because Gordon Ramsay is
over there,

10:31.164 --> 10:33.833
and I know he is making sure
everything is perfect.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.336
Right, blue team.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.438
Juni, tell me about the dish.
What are you doing?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.139
So we're gonna do some
pan-seared scallops

10:40.173 --> 10:42.141
with farro and--

10:42.175 --> 10:43.710
- Farro?
- Yes.

10:43.743 --> 10:45.212
- We need--
- Guys. Yeah, hold on.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.180
Farro is a tough grain.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.781
It's wintery.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.352
We're in spring.
We're in the Malibu hills.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.453
Has anyone questioned this?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.488
- Yes.
- Yes, Chef.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.724
- It's a wedding.
It's not a winter banquet.
- Yes.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.459
- Yes.
- We have that celery root.
Let's use it.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.893
So, I can do
a celery root purée.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.795
Okay. Tell me about the duck.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.032
For the duck,
we're gonna be doing
a pan-seared duck

11:06.065 --> 11:08.868
with an orange zested mash,

11:08.901 --> 11:10.703
- and then we're gonna do--
- An orange zested mash?

11:10.737 --> 11:12.138
Yes.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.541
Hey, blue team.
Blue team, just-- just stop.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.379
An orange zested mash.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.048
Put your hands in the air

11:22.081 --> 11:24.050
if you've ever seen
an orange zested mash

11:24.083 --> 11:26.853
in any restaurant
anywhere in the world.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.156
What are we thinking?

11:30.189 --> 11:34.327
- Meet, discuss, move.
- All: Yes, Chef.

11:34.361 --> 11:38.197
Juni, get everybody you can
on that damn celery root purée.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.932
Juni:
Yes, Chef.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.769
Phew! Thank you, Jesus, Gordon,
for doing that.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.937
Juni, your ideas sucked,

11:44.971 --> 11:47.039
and Gordon got your ass.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.447
All right, guys, come on.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.516
- How are we doing?
- Good, we're doing good.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.050
Scallops are almost prepped.

11:58.084 --> 12:00.953
Julia:
Guys, be consistent
with everything.

12:00.987 --> 12:03.356
- Captain Julia.
- Yes.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.792
Come over, please.
Thank you.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.560
Oh, ( bleep )!

12:07.594 --> 12:08.895
( bleep )!

12:12.231 --> 12:14.467
Stop!

12:14.501 --> 12:17.304
- Who seasoned these?
- We all did, Chef.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.039
What happens to them
when you season them
before you cook them?

12:20.072 --> 12:23.242
- The moisture leaks out.
- That's right.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.111
You never season
until you cook them,

12:25.144 --> 12:27.614
'cause when you hit the pan
it's gonna be watery.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.382
Come on, guys.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.950
Look at the water running out
of them already.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.319
Mark:
That's a cardinal sin.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.253
You season right
before they go in the pan.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.923
Julia, she obviously doesn't
know what she's doing.

12:36.956 --> 12:39.158
We're cooking for a winner
of "MasterChef."

12:39.191 --> 12:42.094
- Yes. I understand.
- Get a cloth and dry them.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.496
Get rid of the seasoning
quickly.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.298
Get a cloth, dry 'em.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.501
Cesar:
We started out strong,
but that one mistake

12:48.535 --> 12:52.339
could send service
into a downward spiral.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.006
Come on, guys.
Please.

13:05.352 --> 13:06.819
Julia:
Chelsea, are you taking
the pepper off of this?

13:06.853 --> 13:08.521
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.657
Emily:
We seasoned the scallops
way too early,

13:10.690 --> 13:12.925
and now everyone's scrambling
to dry 'em off

13:12.959 --> 13:14.293
and to get all the salt
and the pepper

13:14.327 --> 13:15.762
and the oil off
of the scallops.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.129
All right, come on, guys.
Let's go.

13:17.163 --> 13:19.165
It's not in my DNA

13:19.198 --> 13:20.833
that I'm gonna be the captain
of a losing team.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.268
Are you serious?

13:22.301 --> 13:24.136
No. It's not gonna happen.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.972
Come on, guys.
We can do this.

13:26.005 --> 13:28.040
( music playing )

13:32.178 --> 13:34.113
Shaun:
As you guys know,

13:34.146 --> 13:35.815
"MasterChef" has
changed my life.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.850
It's changed everything
about my life.

13:40.052 --> 13:43.055
( clears throat )
Since I lost my dad there's--

13:45.057 --> 13:47.627
( clears throat )
There's only been like one
main role model,

13:47.660 --> 13:51.398
and, uh-- God.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.899
( Shaun clears throat )

13:52.932 --> 13:54.734
Everybody, Gordon Ramsay is
gonna come out,

13:54.767 --> 13:56.869
and he's gonna finish
this off for us.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.304
So, I'd like to introduce you
all right now

13:58.337 --> 14:00.440
to Chef Gordon Ramsay.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.480
Yeah. Okay.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.048
Right.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.318
I'm really honored

14:12.351 --> 14:14.086
to be part of
this very special day,

14:14.120 --> 14:16.355
and I hope that you remember
this for the rest of your lives.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.557
- Absolutely.
- Katie: We will.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.025
- Are we ready?
- Both: Yes.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.727
( all laugh )

14:20.760 --> 14:23.029
All right, guys, 15 minutes
and I need to see a dish.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.597
Juni, make sure
you start delegating.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.233
- Oh, yeah. For sure.
- All right? Let's go.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.068
Just let me know
that the scallops are good.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.738
- Right? Okay.
- Yes, these are patted dry.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.706
By the power vested in me,

14:33.740 --> 14:38.177
it's my honor to declare you
both husband and wife.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.648
And now you may seal this
declaration with a huge kiss.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.317
( cheers and applause )

14:46.919 --> 14:49.288
Your wedding ceremony is over.

14:49.321 --> 14:50.923
Now it's time to celebrate,

14:50.957 --> 14:52.725
and I've got to get
to the kitchen.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.861
- Yeah. Get in there.
Get in there.
- Well done.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.596
- Thank you, Chef.
- You're welcome.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.871
Here it is.
I need a VIP.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.306
- Two top, for the bride
and the groom.
- Yes, Chef.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.609
After that, I need a six
and a five top.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.310
- Yes, Chef.
- Let's go.

15:11.343 --> 15:12.645
Julia:
I want them perfect!

15:12.679 --> 15:14.046
Perfectly seared.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.815
- Do not overcook them.
- No.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.618
- We won't.
- Julia: All right,
pass me up the dishes.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.554
Man:
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. O'Neale.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.591
( cheers and applause )

15:26.192 --> 15:28.327
- How long, Julia?
- 30 seconds.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.329
- Scallops, I need 'em now!
- Scallops up.

15:30.362 --> 15:32.565
I'm excited to eat.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.667
Shaun:
I'm hoping these guys can
pull off an amazing meal.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.669
We're expecting excellence.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.839
Matt, how is the first batch
of purée coming?

15:39.872 --> 15:42.241
- Is it done?
- Purée's coming. It's still--

15:42.274 --> 15:44.176
Still breaking down.
It needs a lot of time.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.613
Juni, I need a time.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.915
- How long?
- So it is gonna be like
another ten minutes.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.316
- Another ten minutes.
- Yeah.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.184
- No. No.
- No.

15:52.218 --> 15:54.821
- Gordon: Where's the purée?
- Juni: It's cooking right now.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.689
Juni, I need to have one
portion of purée made

15:56.723 --> 15:59.191
for at least some tables.
Let's go.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.093
- What are we doing?
- Look at this.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.862
- Juni: It's still too hard.
- Gordon: Stop, stop.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.597
- Juni: Is it done?
- Matt: It's too thick,
yeah, but--

16:04.631 --> 16:06.599
- ( bleep )! Oh, I--
- No.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.034
Hey, hey, hey,
blue team.

16:08.067 --> 16:09.836
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes, Chef.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.538
Listen carefully.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.107
The party has sat down
and the purée's raw.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.110
Already, blue team,
you're all over the place.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.278
And do you know why?

16:19.311 --> 16:20.780
No one's communicating

16:20.813 --> 16:22.148
and the captain's disappeared.

16:23.716 --> 16:25.652
You need to get
on the same page.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.620
- Is that clear?
- All: Yes, Chef.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.522
I'm telling you now,
you drop the purée.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.190
- Yes.
- Five minutes.

16:31.223 --> 16:33.325
- So no purée? Got it.
- Seven covers. Let's go.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.961
Shanika:
We have to completely
change our menu.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.362
We don't have any time.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.630
We gotta figure something out,
like, quick.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.165
We need to do something light,

16:39.198 --> 16:41.033
like a pickled carrot.
Should we do that?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.468
Okay. We can do that.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.503
Thank, God, Taylor steps up.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.138
- We're doing the carrots.
- All right.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.406
I'm just grabbing
a whole bunch of them.

16:47.439 --> 16:49.041
Sorry, Juni,
you suck as a captain.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.342
We need you to lead.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.811
You gotta think on your toes.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.479
Step up!
Everybody step up!

16:53.512 --> 16:55.815
S.J.:
We got this. Let's go!
Let's go! Push!

16:55.848 --> 16:57.149
All right, perfect.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.484
There you go. Good.

16:58.517 --> 16:59.752
Servers, please.
First table.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.220
Bride and groom, sir.

17:01.253 --> 17:02.488
Aarón:
Garnish, Juni.
Let's go.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.023
Come on, let's go.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.491
Juni:
I really need to nail this

17:05.524 --> 17:07.059
because I wanna impress
Chef Aarón.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.328
He gave me this apron,

17:09.361 --> 17:11.397
and hopefully
the dish is perfect,

17:11.430 --> 17:13.099
because it's going out
to the bride and groom.

17:13.132 --> 17:15.367
All right, let's go.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.840
All right, Shaun, Katie.
First opinions.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.775
- So-- Yeah?
- They're both really good.

17:22.809 --> 17:26.112
Joe:
So, the red team,
you have seared scallops

17:26.145 --> 17:29.616
with braised lentils
and snap pea salad.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.018
And for the blue team,

17:32.051 --> 17:34.520
we have seared scallops
with pickled carrots

17:34.553 --> 17:36.623
and blood orange gastrique.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.691
This has a nice
peppery tone to it.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.793
- It's delicious.
- So, the red team,
lentils, peppery.

17:40.827 --> 17:43.062
It's nice--
nice peppery tone.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.263
They did a really good job
pickling those carrots

17:44.296 --> 17:45.932
in a short amount of time.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.467
Flavor's better here,
sear's better here.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.136
If you had to give me a vote
right now. red team, blue team--

17:50.169 --> 17:51.437
- Red team.
- Red team.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.872
Red team, red team.
Great. Enjoy.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.506
Yeah. Thank you, Chef.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.611
- Gordon: Remind me
what's going. A six--
- A six and an eight.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.146
- Talk to them.
- I just did.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.614
- You, focus.
- Yes, Chef.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.249
Table 14, please.
Thank you.

18:03.282 --> 18:04.550
Go!

18:04.583 --> 18:07.586
The way these are cooked
is so perfect,

18:07.620 --> 18:09.455
and the flavor's so great.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.823
Aarón: Come on!
This is somebody's wedding.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.291
Finish me off.
Give me beautiful.

18:12.324 --> 18:13.660
Give me beautiful.
Give me beautiful.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.062
So the blue team's scallops
freaking rock,

18:16.095 --> 18:18.998
and they're seared
perfectly.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.167
Let's go! Con ganas.
Muevete!

18:21.200 --> 18:22.902
Allí. Finish the garnish.
Let's go.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.904
Undercooked or overcooked?
This one looks like a--

18:24.937 --> 18:27.139
this one looks
like a potato chip.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.108
Come on, come on.
What the hell
are you looking at?

18:29.141 --> 18:30.843
- I didn't wanna put it down--
- Yeah, don't worry.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.478
By the time you get over here,
it's gonna be done.

18:32.511 --> 18:34.113
Sounds good.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.982
Tell me.
You guys have refined palates.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.650
You've been through
the "MasterChef" circuit.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.985
- Yeah.
- How did they do?

18:39.018 --> 18:40.653
I just wish that some of the--

18:40.687 --> 18:42.822
some of the cooked on things
like the bacon,

18:42.855 --> 18:44.590
and some of the flavors were
a little bit more developed...

18:44.623 --> 18:46.458
- Right.
- ...but I think
it was a great move

18:46.492 --> 18:48.260
- for an appetizer.
- Excellent. What do you think?

18:48.294 --> 18:51.764
I felt the flavor combination
was great, Joe.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.700
I just want a little more sear
on that scallop.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.268
Got it. Enjoy the rest
of the wedding, guys.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.737
- Thank you. Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you, Chef.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.874
Look at these.
I mean, they're overcooked.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.076
Hey, you two.
You two, come here.

19:05.577 --> 19:08.047
Just ask yourself.
Would you eat those?

19:08.080 --> 19:09.682
- No, I wouldn't.
- No, Chef.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.483
We have a former winner,

19:11.517 --> 19:13.820
and you wanna serve
this ( bleep ).

19:13.853 --> 19:15.054
And this is what bugs me.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.489
No one's giving me standards.

19:17.523 --> 19:18.958
And none of you'd eat that,

19:18.991 --> 19:22.028
but you're happy to serve it
to a winner.

19:23.562 --> 19:24.997
Julia:
He's right.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.565
This is somebody's
freaking wedding.

19:26.598 --> 19:27.867
Like, I don't wanna ruin it.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.401
We gotta get this together.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.503
Enough's enough!

19:40.012 --> 19:42.048
Red team, last table.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.216
Six scallops away.
Let's go.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.085
Yes, Chef.
18 scallops!

19:46.118 --> 19:48.354
- Now!
- They're coming out
in just a second.

19:48.387 --> 19:49.856
Juni, let's go.
Finish these up.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.323
Let's go.
The last push.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.325
Come on, Juni.
Get in there, finish strong.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.994
- Are these good to go,
Juni Captain?
- Yes, those two are good to go.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.396
All right.
Let's go, table seven.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.398
Juni:
We're done, we're done.
We're good.

19:59.431 --> 20:00.933
Matt:
Now that appetizers are done,

20:00.967 --> 20:02.601
all I know is
with this entrée round,

20:02.634 --> 20:04.403
we have to do a way better job

20:04.436 --> 20:05.772
if we wanna win
this team challenge.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.073
Lentils. Come on!

20:07.106 --> 20:08.440
- Come on.
- Plate down, please.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.676
- Nice cut on the scallops.
- Thank you.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.511
- Come on, guys.
- Service, please.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.513
- Gordon: Table 18. Let's go.
- Julia: That's it.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.415
- Let's regroup.
- Let's regroup, guys. Come on.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.184
Chelsea:
I actually think
the red team did great.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.752
I mean, under the circumstances.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.088
Scallops is not
an easy protein.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.256
I feel great and I know

20:24.290 --> 20:26.759
that we just have to keep up
the momentum for the entrée,

20:26.793 --> 20:28.127
and we cannot slow down.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.561
Cheers to the red team!

20:29.595 --> 20:31.130
- They did good.
- Go, red!

20:31.163 --> 20:32.832
Yes!

20:35.067 --> 20:36.535
Red team had
a really slow start,

20:36.568 --> 20:37.870
but they've actually
stepped up.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.939
- Come on, guys.
- On the blue team,

20:39.972 --> 20:41.473
Juni has completely lost
his voice.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.810
He was not leading,
not delegating.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.311
Juni needs to step back up,

20:45.344 --> 20:47.546
delegate and make sure
that we can execute

20:47.579 --> 20:49.048
the way it should be
to our standards.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.550
- Bounce back.
- Bounce back. That's right.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.819
I know the apps are important,

20:52.852 --> 20:54.386
but the star today
is gonna be that duck.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.788
Joe:
The cook has to be perfect.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.423
We need fat rendered,
we need crispy skin.

20:57.456 --> 20:59.058
If we don't have
those elements, we got nothing.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.559
Next course is make or break

21:00.592 --> 21:02.261
for the red
and the blue team.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.630
I want these all scored
exactly the same...

21:04.663 --> 21:06.365
- Okay, I got you.
- ...and I want 'em perfect.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.802
Julia, I need you right now.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.238
- Yes.
- Talk to me quickly.
What are you making?

21:12.271 --> 21:13.639
We're gonna sear
the duck breast.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.907
We're gonna do some
tri-color potatoes,

21:14.941 --> 21:16.775
and then we're doing
some mushrooms,

21:16.809 --> 21:18.510
that we're just gonna sauté
in some butter,

21:18.544 --> 21:20.246
and then a red wine
cherry sauce.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.948
Julia, if this duck
is messed up, it's all on you.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.149
Julia:
I'm the team captain,

21:23.182 --> 21:24.951
so anything that goes wrong,

21:24.984 --> 21:26.685
of course
they're gonna blame me.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.754
So just pay attention,
listen to what I'm saying,

21:28.787 --> 21:30.189
and we're gonna be fine.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.158
Dry 'em, score 'em.
Salt and pepper.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.960
Let's get 'em on the side.
Let's get 'em ready.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.495
- Captain. Tell me about
the dish. What are you doing?
- Yes.

21:36.528 --> 21:38.630
We're gonna do
a pan-seared duck,

21:38.664 --> 21:40.632
and we're changing the mash...

21:40.666 --> 21:44.436
- Okay, love it.
- ...to a garlic herb
mashed potato

21:44.470 --> 21:47.639
- and then we're gonna do
some charred Romanesco.
- Okay.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.842
- How are you gonna make
that mash wonderful?
- Uh, yes.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.444
Gordon:
I mean garlic mash
is so simple. It's--

21:52.478 --> 21:53.880
The garlic is going
to be roasted

21:53.913 --> 21:55.714
before it's put into the mash.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.952
Thank you, Chef.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.487
- Shanika: So you're not gonna
do the fondant potatoes?
- No.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.955
Come over here, please.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.857
Garlic mash is not sexy,
it's not elegant.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.126
We can do the fondant potatoes
a little bit smaller.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.494
It'll be easier
for us to cook 'em,

22:08.527 --> 22:09.862
because we can do 'em
on top of the stove,

22:09.896 --> 22:10.863
baste 'em with some butter.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.798
Garlic mashed potatoes. Come on.

22:12.831 --> 22:13.966
How simple can you get?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.501
We already have
the mash going

22:15.534 --> 22:17.469
- in the pots right now.
- I know,

22:17.503 --> 22:19.571
but I don't think it's better
than a fondant potato.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.073
For somebody's wedding?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.209
We're doing the mash
in the piping bag

22:23.242 --> 22:25.811
so that we can make sure
that we have consistency

22:25.844 --> 22:28.180
- and it doesn't look bad.
- All right. You're the captain.

22:28.214 --> 22:31.150
Go with the little funky
mashed potatoes then.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.919
In the piping bag.

22:35.687 --> 22:37.223
- You guys good
on potatoes then?
- Yeah.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.158
- You're not peeling?
- Oh, we are peeling,

22:39.191 --> 22:41.027
but by cutting them first
like this.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.228
Juni:
Got it, got it, got it.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.662
Of course, like,
a little bit of skin

22:43.695 --> 22:44.863
won't make too much
of a difference.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.165
Juni:
Yeah, that's fine.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.734
Okay, we need to get
some garlic roasted.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.336
- It's in the oven, Juni.
- It's in the oven.
Ah, you're the best.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.005
Shaun: Entrée round
I'm terrified about.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.941
Duck breast is a hard
protein to cook.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.409
Hopefully there's somebody
that knows how to render fat

22:57.443 --> 22:59.045
and knows
how to appropriately cook

22:59.078 --> 23:01.213
a nice, beautiful, pink-
all-the-way-through duck.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.715
- How we doing on this?
- We're looking really good.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.018
I'm just making sure
that they render perfectly
and I don't burn any of them.

23:06.052 --> 23:08.220
Guys, those mushrooms
should be done!

23:08.254 --> 23:11.623
Gordon:
What are you doing?
What's in there?

23:11.657 --> 23:12.858
Does it need more salt?

23:12.891 --> 23:14.226
There's no salt in there.

23:14.260 --> 23:15.962
- Did you taste the water?
- No, Chef.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.298
I am starting
to lose confidence.

23:19.331 --> 23:21.067
Things are just falling apart.

23:21.100 --> 23:25.972
Blue team, charred Romanesco
is on a charcoal grill.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.040
So what are
we charring it on?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.875
Lindsay:
Are we getting 'em
in cast-iron?

23:29.908 --> 23:31.643
I was thinking the broiler.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.245
That's not charred, is it?

23:33.279 --> 23:35.147
- That's roasted.
- I think they were gonna do it

23:35.181 --> 23:37.049
over the open flame.
That's what I thought.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.251
- Open flame? Open flame?
- Yes. That's what I thought.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.988
Oh, my God!
Speak up!

23:42.021 --> 23:43.956
Taylor:
I am so frustrated,

23:43.990 --> 23:45.992
because we have lost our captain
at this point.

23:46.025 --> 23:47.893
- Who's on the mash?
- We are here, sir.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.395
They're going
to be working on it.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.330
They're preparing the potatoes
right now, Chef.

23:51.363 --> 23:54.500
- Good.
- Ralph:
Blue team's ship is sinking.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.668
Our confidence level is so down.

23:56.702 --> 23:57.970
Somebody needs to step up ASAP.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.072
The MasterChef mashed potatoes.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.573
Holy ( bleep )!

24:01.607 --> 24:03.175
- Hey, you two, come here.
- Hey.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.510
Hey, come here, you two.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.348
We came in to this competition
with ambition to win.

24:09.381 --> 24:11.450
We're making mashed potatoes.

24:11.483 --> 24:14.853
We go there, down to there.

24:14.886 --> 24:17.856
We've got skin on.

24:17.889 --> 24:19.791
Black eyes here.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.360
Now, when I said to you all,

24:21.393 --> 24:23.329
"Set yourselves up
for success,"

24:23.362 --> 24:26.132
you're ( bleep ) even
before you come out of the gate.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.134
Look.

24:28.167 --> 24:30.536
Mashed potatoes.
Mashed potatoes.

24:30.569 --> 24:32.471
Someone came up
with a smart idea of fondants.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.540
- Who was that earlier?
- Shanika.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.875
So it's one fondant
per person.

24:36.908 --> 24:38.644
Half a potato, cut,
ring in, done.

24:38.677 --> 24:40.346
But, look.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.514
How does that
become a stunning mash?

24:42.548 --> 24:44.216
It doesn't, Chef.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.851
Let me tell you something.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.453
You are not gonna captain
this team any longer.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.954
Have a meeting,

24:48.987 --> 24:50.689
and somebody step up
and run this team.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.691
If not, I'm gonna run it.

24:52.724 --> 24:54.126
All:
Yes, Chef.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.194
Now!

25:02.501 --> 25:04.236
You are not gonna captain
this team any longer.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.373
Have a meeting, and somebody
step up and run this team.

25:07.406 --> 25:08.974
If not, I'm gonna run it.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.376
All:
Yes, Chef.

25:10.409 --> 25:11.543
Now!

25:14.046 --> 25:16.148
I'm totally okay with, like,
stepping in and doing this.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.516
Are you okay with that?
Are you all okay with that?

25:17.549 --> 25:19.051
- Right.
- Yep. Okay, let's go.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.220
Who am I to fight this?

25:21.253 --> 25:23.489
Juni, who is the captain?

25:23.522 --> 25:25.391
Taylor's stepping in.

25:25.424 --> 25:26.725
Taylor is brave enough
to step in

25:26.758 --> 25:28.026
and say that she wants
to be captain.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.561
I'm okay with the decision.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.497
- Everyone good to go?
- Yes.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.599
I'm not, the only reason I'm not
is because of the potatoes.

25:33.632 --> 25:36.202
We can do one
fondant potato per person.
You cut 'em in half.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.736
- Okay. Then, yes, let's do it.
- Come here, Taylor.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.071
- Let's do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.073
Phew!
Thank you, Taylor.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.908
Sorry, Juni.

25:42.941 --> 25:44.576
Your voice wasn't loud enough,
your ideas sucked.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.578
We need leadership.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.614
Gordon:
Young man,
I know you can do better.

25:48.647 --> 25:51.350
Now you may not
be the captain
of blue team,

25:51.383 --> 25:52.851
but it doesn't mean to say
you have to give up.

25:52.884 --> 25:54.453
Understood.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.222
- Taylor.
- Yes, Chef.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.856
- We need to get
this thing moving.
- Got it.

25:57.889 --> 26:01.527
I am not going
to let Gordon Ramsay down.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.762
Now it's my time to just
bring it and prove to him

26:03.795 --> 26:05.764
that he made a right decision
giving me that apron.

26:05.797 --> 26:08.334
It's a little bit thick.
We need to lighten it up
a little bit.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.404
Aarón:
Red team, listen up.

26:12.438 --> 26:13.639
Five minutes.
It's go time.

26:13.672 --> 26:16.142
Chelsea,
get the sauce down.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.576
Julia is loud in the kitchen,

26:17.609 --> 26:18.944
but she's not just yelling
at us.

26:18.977 --> 26:20.212
She's leading the team.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.481
Let's go!
Come on, Chelsea.

26:22.514 --> 26:23.749
We're on a roll.
The red team's doing great.

26:23.782 --> 26:25.984
Keep it up, guys.

26:26.017 --> 26:27.619
Who's on the red wine sauce?

26:27.653 --> 26:29.755
Ashley has it reducing
right now.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.057
How many portions are here?

26:32.090 --> 26:33.959
That's...

26:33.992 --> 26:35.927
- Come on! Taylor.
- ...maybe 12, Chef.

26:35.961 --> 26:38.464
- Yes, Chef.
- Five portions of sauce there

26:38.497 --> 26:40.966
and barely ten there.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.435
And all you've been making,
young lady, is the sauce.

26:43.469 --> 26:47.105
- Yes, Chef.
- And yet you've got
35 portions not done.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.774
I gave you a pin,
I believe you,

26:48.807 --> 26:50.509
but you just--
you're just not with it.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.744
- Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef.
- You've gotta help me.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.580
We got this. No, no, it's okay.
Deep breath.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.182
- You got this, you got this.
- Hey, you're just wasting time.

26:56.215 --> 26:58.016
- Yes, Chef.
- Taylor: I'm honestly shocked

26:58.049 --> 27:01.453
to see Ashley kind of
breaking down a little bit.

27:01.487 --> 27:05.157
I do feel bad
that she's so upset,

27:05.191 --> 27:06.625
but we don't have time for that.

27:06.658 --> 27:08.160
You've got nothing done.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.661
Just get your act together.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.497
That's enough.

27:11.530 --> 27:13.165
Get a grip, 50 portions.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.533
Deep breath.
We got it, girl.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.134
- Let's go.
- ( Ashley groans )

27:16.168 --> 27:19.037
I need a beautiful duck dish
for the bride and groom,

27:19.070 --> 27:20.606
and then I need a six top
following that.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.608
Julia:
I want these all
out together.

27:22.641 --> 27:23.875
Let's go.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.944
Get those potatoes
right now, guys.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.846
Don't just sit around.
Come on. Quicker, Ryan.

27:27.879 --> 27:29.815
Shanika, let's get
all those potatoes on.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.317
They're coming.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.385
We're gonna break it
down into two teams.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.987
I'm gonna be right here,
and we're gonna have Juni

27:36.021 --> 27:37.489
and Matt helping me.

27:37.523 --> 27:39.157
Get ready for game time.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.792
Okay, Aarón,

27:40.826 --> 27:43.195
which one is the bride
and groom's dish?

27:43.229 --> 27:45.231
- It's right here, my friend.
- All right, beautiful.

27:45.264 --> 27:47.566
- Looks good.
- Gerron, I've got
12 ducks coming up.

27:47.599 --> 27:50.135
- Hot plate right now, come on.
- Hey. Psst!

27:50.168 --> 27:51.737
Yeah?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.739
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.140
We need the potatoes.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.542
Oh, we need the potatoes.
Yes. Yes, potatoes.

27:56.575 --> 27:58.710
Oh, my God almighty.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.145
- Yes, Chef.
- Hey, Clark Kent.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.847
- Wake up.
- Yes, Chef.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.682
Okay, we're ready for
the bride and groom dish.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.217
We're working on 'em
right here.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.819
Let's go. Two more minutes
to go. Right here.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.856
Sauce, potato.

28:10.889 --> 28:12.691
Potato!

28:12.724 --> 28:14.693
- Potato. Yes, Chef.
- ( bleep ) potato head!

28:14.726 --> 28:17.162
Are you serious?

28:17.195 --> 28:19.331
- Bride and groom. Thank you.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.333
Gordon:
Get it together.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.168
- All right, Chef.
- Or ( bleep ) off
and feed the giraffe.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.936
Yes, Chef.

28:24.970 --> 28:28.374
- Gordon: Oh, my Lord.
- ( cheers and applause )

28:28.407 --> 28:30.242
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

28:30.276 --> 28:33.779
For the blue team, we have a
cherry and red wine reduction,

28:33.812 --> 28:35.881
potato fondant, Romanesco,

28:35.914 --> 28:39.217
and here we have a wine
reduction sauce

28:39.251 --> 28:41.453
with mushrooms
and roasted potatoes.

28:41.487 --> 28:45.090
- What do you think?
- The blue team's duck is cooked
perfect for me.

28:45.123 --> 28:46.858
Perfect? Wow!
How's that sauce?

28:46.892 --> 28:48.860
- Looks a little
over-reduced, maybe?
- It is,

28:48.894 --> 28:50.396
but I could care less
about that.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.698
The duck is cooked
pretty much perfectly.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.267
- Red team? Hmm.
- This is a little sloppy.

28:55.301 --> 28:58.370
Potatoes and mushrooms
are great but the duck is
a little under...

28:58.404 --> 29:00.306
- Yeah.
- ...which is a bummer,

29:00.339 --> 29:01.573
'cause they had such a strong
showing on the appetizer.

29:01.607 --> 29:03.375
Okay.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.043
Well, let's hope they did better
for the rest of your guests.

29:05.076 --> 29:06.612
I hope so, too.
I hope so, too.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.647
Aarón:
All right, guys, let's go.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.382
- Six top.
- I got two ducks ready to fly.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.151
Julia:
Let's go! Get me the mushrooms
out here now!

29:13.184 --> 29:14.653
Six and a five coming up.
All right, servers.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.591
Woman:
The red team's duck was great.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.561
They had amazing vegetables.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.129
The potatoes were amazing.

29:24.162 --> 29:27.098
The mushrooms were cooked
very well.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.467
My duck was cooked great.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.801
I ate all of it.

29:29.835 --> 29:31.503
Guys, we need to get
those plates up here.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.671
Warm plates, right now.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.808
Gordon:
I need a six and a one.
Come on, come on, come on.

29:36.842 --> 29:39.277
I had the blue team's duck
tonight.

29:39.311 --> 29:41.179
It was pretty good.
There were a couple pieces

29:41.212 --> 29:44.616
that were a little bit rarer
than I would prefer,

29:44.650 --> 29:46.652
but the flavor was good
and the sauce was good.

29:46.685 --> 29:49.455
All right, guys,
I'm gonna fire three six tops.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.256
- Smarty-pants,
how many is that?
- 18.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.158
I wanna go to the college
y'all went to.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.994
Dan:
I'd like a little more sear
on the duck,

29:56.027 --> 29:57.529
but overall,
pretty damn good dish.

29:57.563 --> 29:59.598
- Move your ass!
- Yes, Chef.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.099
The flavor was excellent,

30:01.132 --> 30:03.134
but the meat was a little cool
in the middle.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.437
- Last six. Let's go!
- All right, y'all,

30:05.471 --> 30:06.672
this is our last table
right here.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.940
We need perfect ducks going out.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.142
The very last. Come on, y'all,
this is it. Let's go, let's go.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.879
Aarón:
This is the last six top.
I need it now.

30:13.912 --> 30:15.180
I need duck on a plate,
garnish last.

30:15.213 --> 30:16.982
Gerron:
I got four sitting ducks.

30:17.015 --> 30:18.650
- Let's go!
- I got it. No problem.
Ain't no thing.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.686
Coming around, coming around.
Take it, take it, take it.

30:20.719 --> 30:22.354
There you go.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.689
That's what
we're talking about.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.223
- We got it.
- We got it.

30:25.256 --> 30:27.726
Hey, come here, y'all.
We did our best.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.495
We didn't have that much
organization,

30:29.528 --> 30:30.896
but we served them.

30:30.929 --> 30:33.365
Even though it was chaotic
in our kitchen,

30:33.399 --> 30:36.134
we did get all the dishes out.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.570
I really hope
that we can pull this off,

30:38.604 --> 30:40.238
but I don't know
if it was enough.

30:40.271 --> 30:42.240
We should hold our heads up.
Let's break this down,

30:42.273 --> 30:43.509
but good job.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.076
- Go for it.
- We're done.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.713
- Way to pull it together, guys.
- Great job, great job.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.815
Finally service is over,

30:49.848 --> 30:51.149
and everybody was working
together

30:51.182 --> 30:53.084
as a really good cohesive team.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.553
I gotta be honest,

30:54.586 --> 30:56.254
I'm feeling pretty confident
right now.

30:56.287 --> 30:58.657
Joe:
Hello, everybody.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.659
Enjoying the lovely wedding?
Everything good?

31:00.692 --> 31:02.661
- The wedding is amazing.
- Did you enjoy your duck?

31:02.694 --> 31:05.363
- We did not enjoy our duck, no.
- No one?

31:05.397 --> 31:06.665
- So--
- It was literally blood red.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.534
This was the duck
from the red team.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.201
Everything looks really good.

31:10.235 --> 31:12.337
- Clean up.
- So undercooked you think?

31:12.370 --> 31:14.506
Raw?

31:14.540 --> 31:16.842
I'll have them
make 'em all again.
I'll be right back.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.077
Julia:
Where are you putting these
dishes, back there?

31:19.110 --> 31:22.380
- Do we have scrubbies?
- Can you put some soap
in here, please?

31:22.414 --> 31:23.915
Should we just throw
this stuff out?

31:23.949 --> 31:26.017
- Yeah.
- So this is just garbage?

31:26.051 --> 31:28.854
- ( grunts )
- Guys.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.255
We got an issue.

31:30.288 --> 31:32.023
They're clearing out tables.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.459
These people pulled me aside.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.060
They refuse to eat this.
They say it's raw

31:35.093 --> 31:37.963
and disgusting.
We need more plates on the fly.

31:37.996 --> 31:39.431
- Oh, God.
- What happened?

31:39.465 --> 31:41.366
- We're wrapped up.
- Four new plates?

31:41.399 --> 31:43.569
- Mushrooms are in the garbage.
- I know. I threw 'em out.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.604
Mushrooms are thrown out.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.739
We don't have mushrooms,
we don't have sauce.

31:47.773 --> 31:49.140
Oh, my God.
The duck is raw.

31:49.174 --> 31:50.942
We have to remake the plates,

31:50.976 --> 31:52.410
but we've thrown away all
of our ingredients.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.379
Can you get the mushrooms
in the pan now?

31:54.412 --> 31:56.782
- What can I do?
- Farhan: The team
is freaking out.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.717
We thought we had nailed it

31:58.750 --> 32:00.719
and now I'm hoping it's not
enough to make us lose tonight.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.721
Service isn't over
till it's over.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.756
Farhan:
Oh, my God.

32:13.632 --> 32:14.966
Guys.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.401
These people are not eating.

32:16.434 --> 32:17.736
They refuse to eat this.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.505
They say it's raw
and disgusting.

32:19.538 --> 32:20.972
We need four plates on the fly.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.008
- Oh, my God.
- Let's go!

32:23.041 --> 32:25.343
We got, like, two minutes
to make this happen.

32:25.376 --> 32:28.146
- Mushrooms are in the garbage.
- Cesar, where's the sauce?

32:28.179 --> 32:29.648
It got thrown out.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.316
It got thrown out!
Everything got thrown out!

32:31.349 --> 32:33.418
Gerron:
Come on, we need to make
something real quick.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.953
Julia:
We should've known better.

32:34.986 --> 32:35.954
Service isn't over
until the last person

32:35.987 --> 32:37.823
walks out of the reception.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.858
- Come on, guys. Let's go!
- Four portions, let's go.

32:39.891 --> 32:42.093
Aarón:
I need potatoes hot.
I need that sauce sexy.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.294
Come on, guys.
We can do this.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.163
We made a mistake,

32:45.196 --> 32:47.799
and I really hope this doesn't
affect our chances.

32:47.833 --> 32:51.503
You know what?
It would really suck
if we did not win today.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.539
Bring out the mushrooms
when they're done,
family-style,

32:53.572 --> 32:55.006
because if not, these people
are gonna walk on me.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.642
- Okay?
- Aarón: Plate 'em right now.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.476
Let's go. Put the duck on.
Let's go, come on.

32:58.510 --> 32:59.778
Come with the third.
Let's go.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.379
Never throw anything away.

33:01.412 --> 33:03.448
- Totally, no.
- Lesson learned.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.884
Okay, re-plated, redone.

33:05.917 --> 33:07.519
The only problem is
we don't have mushrooms

33:07.553 --> 33:09.320
because they're
re-cooking 'em again.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.823
They're gonna come out and serve
'em to you family-style.

33:11.857 --> 33:13.391
They're very sorry.
Bon appétit.

33:13.424 --> 33:14.826
Thank you.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.528
We got the plates out
that we needed to.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.329
We re-fired what was raw,

33:18.363 --> 33:19.898
and we made as many people
happy as we could.

33:19.931 --> 33:21.800
That's really the name
of the game.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.234
Job well done.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.804
Team red, love it.
Thank you.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.372
Emily:
I was on the losing team
last team challenge,

33:27.405 --> 33:29.207
and that's not a good feeling.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.842
I don't know what happened
on the other side of that wall,

33:30.876 --> 33:32.510
but if the blue team did even

33:32.544 --> 33:34.312
a slightly better cook
of their duck,

33:34.345 --> 33:35.914
they could pull out a win.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.183
( music playing )

33:38.216 --> 33:41.319
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
welcome our talented home cooks

33:41.352 --> 33:44.756
that were up against it today.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.158
Welcome our red team
and our blue team, ladies
and gentlemen, thank you.

33:47.192 --> 33:50.195
( cheers and applause )

33:57.268 --> 33:58.670
Now for the important part.

33:58.704 --> 34:01.239
Are the lovely couple
ready to announce

34:01.272 --> 34:04.475
which team served the best meal
across this incredible lunch?

34:07.045 --> 34:08.079
Yes, Chef.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.082
Gordon:
Good.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.484
Please pick up
the champagne.

34:17.155 --> 34:19.124
The winning team...

34:22.828 --> 34:25.396
- is...
- One, two, three.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.465
- ...red team.
- ( cheers and applause )

34:32.904 --> 34:34.139
Julia:
The red team won!

34:34.172 --> 34:36.441
Bravissimo!
This is perfection!

34:36.474 --> 34:38.443
Forget about it.
I knew we were gonna win.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.978
You're amazing!

34:40.011 --> 34:42.881
Team captain!
She's the best!

34:42.914 --> 34:45.283
I know that we had some snags
along the way,

34:45.316 --> 34:46.317
but I feel in the end

34:46.351 --> 34:48.286
we had a great system going.

34:48.319 --> 34:50.488
I'm so proud of my team.

34:50.521 --> 34:52.290
Congratulations,
red team.

34:52.323 --> 34:54.259
You're safe from elimination,
and guys,

34:54.292 --> 34:55.894
you really, really earned it.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.562
Thank you!

34:57.595 --> 35:00.999
And you know what that means,
blue team.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.801
Please head to the kitchen
and clean up.

35:02.834 --> 35:03.869
Thank you.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.073
Just... very disappointing.

35:08.106 --> 35:12.978
I thought that I could step up
and be a team captain,

35:13.011 --> 35:15.280
and turn this whole thing
around,

35:15.313 --> 35:16.347
but it just wasn't enough.

35:16.381 --> 35:18.817
And it just really sucks.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.920
I think once we got the hang
of everything toward the end,

35:21.953 --> 35:25.490
everything was starting
to get a little stronger.

35:25.523 --> 35:27.092
- We finished stronger
than we started.
- Yeah, definitely.

35:27.125 --> 35:30.295
It really sucks
to be on the losing team again.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.497
I chose the people
on the red team

35:32.530 --> 35:34.866
because I wanted to be
with those people and
I know how they work,

35:34.900 --> 35:38.870
but you just gotta play
with the cards that you're
dealt with.

35:41.372 --> 35:42.808
Joe:
Guys, come on over, please.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.976
Line up here. Come on.
Quick, quick, quick.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.212
That was not a good performance.

35:47.245 --> 35:50.548
My saving grace was
when we switched captains,

35:50.581 --> 35:53.151
finally we had a little bit
of authority.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.453
We got it together.
Yes, it wasn't smooth,

35:55.486 --> 35:57.823
but I'm not expecting it
to be smooth.

35:57.856 --> 36:01.126
You made it hard for yourselves.
You do deserve to lose.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.062
However, there were a few
individuals that did shine,

36:04.095 --> 36:05.630
let me tell you.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.532
So, we decided

36:07.565 --> 36:11.369
that we're gonna save
two cooks from elimination.

36:13.739 --> 36:18.676
And that's Shanika and...

36:18.710 --> 36:21.546
Taylor.

36:21.579 --> 36:23.414
Lindsay:
I'm thrilled for Taylor.

36:23.448 --> 36:25.016
I mean, I think
she's done a great job.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.252
I mean, she walked in
in chaos and managed

36:27.285 --> 36:28.586
to turn that around.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.421
I think she absolutely
deserves it.

36:30.455 --> 36:32.724
Congratulations,
Taylor, Shanika.

36:32.758 --> 36:35.493
You are safe from elimination.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.062
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you, Chef.

36:37.095 --> 36:41.099
A couple of bright spots
in an otherwise dismal team.

36:41.132 --> 36:44.702
The rest of you will be facing
elimination tomorrow.

36:45.937 --> 36:49.941
Now, all of you,
clean this mess quickly,

36:49.975 --> 36:52.610
and I'll see you back
in the MasterChef kitchen.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.279
Not good.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.613
We have two people we know
are gonna go

36:55.646 --> 36:57.448
straight up to the balcony,

36:57.482 --> 36:59.785
and the seven of us are up
for elimination,

36:59.818 --> 37:01.352
'cause no one is safe.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.122
That's a terrible feeling
to have.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.423
I can't go home right now.

37:05.456 --> 37:08.459
I can't go home.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.338
Come on down, guys.
Please.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.275
Ashley:
It feels terrible

37:24.309 --> 37:25.476
going into the pressure test.

37:25.510 --> 37:28.914
I am wearing Gordon's pin.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.449
If I don't make it up
to that balcony,

37:31.482 --> 37:34.752
he is going to be
so disappointed.

37:34.786 --> 37:37.655
All of you, welcome back
to the MasterChef kitchen.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.757
Yesterday was challenging.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.059
Trust me.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.693
That was the idea.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.931
There could only be one
winning team,

37:45.964 --> 37:47.833
and red team, that was you.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.300
Congratulations.

37:49.334 --> 37:51.903
You are all safe
from elimination.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.439
Gordon:
Blue team, as you know,

37:54.472 --> 37:57.943
we decided to save
Taylor and Shanika.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.577
Congratulations.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.946
You're both safe.
Head up onto the balcony.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.613
Thank you, Chef.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.752
When deciding exactly

38:07.785 --> 38:11.823
what this pressure test
would be,

38:11.857 --> 38:14.025
we decided...

38:14.059 --> 38:16.061
there is
no pressure test.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.331
No pressure test.

38:20.365 --> 38:21.532
I mean, this is concerning.

38:21.566 --> 38:23.368
Usually you can come in here

38:23.401 --> 38:25.670
and show 'em that you have what
it takes to still go farther

38:25.703 --> 38:27.538
in this competition.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.174
I'm running through
everything I did in my head

38:29.207 --> 38:32.010
and trying to think,
did I do enough to get through?

38:32.043 --> 38:35.580
We are sending one of you home.

38:37.348 --> 38:41.953
Ralph, Bowen,

38:41.987 --> 38:46.958
Lindsay, Matt, S.J.,

38:46.992 --> 38:49.394
the five of you...

38:49.427 --> 38:50.495
you're safe.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.831
( whispering )
Oh, my God.

38:53.865 --> 38:56.667
Head up onto the balcony.

39:07.712 --> 39:12.150
Juni, possibly one of the worst
performing captains

39:12.183 --> 39:14.552
I've ever witnessed.
Ever.

39:16.087 --> 39:19.857
You let go
of your responsibilities.

39:21.893 --> 39:25.563
Ashley, you cracked
under pressure.

39:25.596 --> 39:28.266
Like I've never expected.

39:28.299 --> 39:31.269
You're standing there
with tears in your eyes

39:31.302 --> 39:32.737
about a sauce.

39:35.073 --> 39:38.076
- Ashley...
- Yes, Chef.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.113
...you are staying.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.053
Congrats.

39:50.821 --> 39:52.590
Good luck.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.192
Thank you, Chef.
Thank you, Chef.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.226
Thank you, Joe.

39:56.995 --> 40:01.132
Juni, unfortunately,
your journey ends tonight.

40:01.166 --> 40:04.302
You know, young man,
you came in with a spark

40:04.335 --> 40:08.206
and the charisma and we loved
that attitude.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.975
But, unfortunately,
your team was doomed

40:10.008 --> 40:12.043
before they started yesterday.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.245
The menu was badly
conceptualized,

40:14.279 --> 40:17.248
and you lost complete direction
of your team.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.317
We wish you all the best.

40:19.350 --> 40:20.718
Thank you.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.287
Please take the apron off

40:22.320 --> 40:24.422
and leave the MasterChef
kitchen.

40:24.455 --> 40:27.658
I thank you for everything
that you have taught me,

40:27.692 --> 40:30.261
and I thank you all
for the lovely friendships,

40:30.295 --> 40:31.896
and I wish you all
the best of luck.

40:31.929 --> 40:33.999
- Bye, Juni.
- May the next MasterChef win.

40:34.032 --> 40:37.268
See you in Carolina!

40:37.302 --> 40:40.505
Juni:
It's sad that my journey's
ending so soon,

40:40.538 --> 40:42.007
but the fact that I've been able

40:42.040 --> 40:43.741
to cook great dishes,

40:43.774 --> 40:45.676
and I have even stepped
into the MasterChef kitchen,

40:45.710 --> 40:48.313
Gordon Ramsay has tasted
my food.

40:48.346 --> 40:50.481
How many people can say
that they have done that?

40:50.515 --> 40:52.483
Not many.

40:52.517 --> 40:54.685
I think that
when my mom sees this,

40:54.719 --> 40:57.422
she's going to be even more
proud of me.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.424
She's gonna see that,
you know,

40:59.457 --> 41:01.726
I've really ignited the fire
to keep it going.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.532
The competition's getting
harder every day.

41:07.565 --> 41:10.201
Taylor:
It's getting real
in this kitchen.

41:10.235 --> 41:11.636
People are going like that.

41:11.669 --> 41:13.771
Aarón just lost

41:13.804 --> 41:15.340
another member of his team.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.475
He's down to six aprons.

41:17.508 --> 41:21.546
Joe is at six,
and Gordon's still at five.

41:21.579 --> 41:24.815
I just gotta stay strong,
stay positive and focus,

41:24.849 --> 41:26.984
and really, really continue
to earn my spot here.

41:27.018 --> 41:32.057
You've got to keep your sights
set on that MasterChef trophy.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.791
Get some rest.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.826
Good night.

41:36.927 --> 41:38.363
Narrator:
Next time...

41:38.396 --> 41:42.033
Tonight, cooking alongside you,
Aarón Sánchez.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.169
- Yes!
- Whoo!

41:44.202 --> 41:45.236
...a MasterChef...

41:45.270 --> 41:46.804
This is like Christmas, baby.

41:46.837 --> 41:49.207
- ...brings gifts...
- Oh, my gosh.

41:49.240 --> 41:50.575
...from the Bayou.

41:50.608 --> 41:52.743
- This sucks.
- ( screams )

41:52.777 --> 41:55.646
And when big Cajun flavors
turn up the heat...

41:55.680 --> 41:57.682
- I got a live one.
- ( laughs )

41:57.715 --> 42:00.418
Cooking next to Aarón is
absolutely terrifying.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.187
- ...the top 17...
- Look at me.

42:02.220 --> 42:04.889
...face the shock
of the season.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.524
There's more on the line
than you thought.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.393
Oh, Lord.
