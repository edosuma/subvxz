00:37.090 --> 00:40.790
You know, there's been a heap of legends[br]and tall tales about Robin Hood.

00:40.880 --> 00:42.840
All different too.

00:42.920 --> 00:47.260
Well, we folks of the animal kingdom[br]have our own version.

00:47.350 --> 00:50.680
It's the story of what really happened[br]in Sherwood Forest.

03:34.650 --> 03:37.910
Oh, incidentally,[br]I'm Allan-A-Dale, a minstrel.

03:37.990 --> 03:40.200
That's an early-day folk singer.

03:40.290 --> 03:45.440
And my job is to tell it like it is[br]or was or whatever.

03:49.460 --> 03:52.550
Robin Hood and LittleJohn[br]walkin'through the forest

03:52.630 --> 03:56.380
Laughin'back and forth[br]at what the other one has to say

03:57.970 --> 04:00.880
Reminiscin'this and that[br]and havin'such a good time

04:00.970 --> 04:04.330
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

04:06.930 --> 04:10.190
Never ever thinkin'there was danger[br]in the water they were drinkin'

04:10.270 --> 04:12.680
They just guzzled it down

04:12.770 --> 04:15.400
Never dreamin'[br]that a schemin'sheriff and his posse

04:15.480 --> 04:20.300
Was a-watchin'them[br]and gatherin'around

04:20.399 --> 04:23.240
Robin Hood and LittleJohn[br]runnin'through the forest

04:23.330 --> 04:27.190
Jumpin'fences, dodgin'trees[br]and tryin'to get away

04:29.330 --> 04:32.080
Contemplatin'nothin'but escape[br]and finally makin'it

04:32.160 --> 04:35.780
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

04:37.240 --> 04:43.040
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

04:43.130 --> 04:46.380
You know somethin', Robin?[br]You're takin' too many chances.

04:46.470 --> 04:50.050
Chances? You must be joking.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.920
That was just a bit[br]of a lark, Little John.

04:52.010 --> 04:54.730
Yeah? Take a look at your hat.

04:54.810 --> 04:56.940
That's not a candle on a cake.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.720
Hello. This one almost[br]had my name on it, didn't it?

05:00.810 --> 05:02.600
They're getting better,[br]you know.

05:02.690 --> 05:05.520
You've got to admit it.[br]They are getting better.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.100
Uh, yeah. The next time that sheriff'll[br]probably have a rope around our necks.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.410
Pretty hard to laugh[br]hangin' there, Rob.

05:13.490 --> 05:17.160
Ha! The sheriff and his whole posse[br]couldn't lift you off the ground.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.410
On guard!

05:18.490 --> 05:21.440
Hey, watch it, Rob.[br]That's the only hat I've got.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.740
Oh, come along.[br]You worry too much, old boy.

05:24.840 --> 05:27.080
You know somethin', Robin,[br]I was just wonderin'?

05:27.170 --> 05:29.580
Are we good guys or bad guys?

05:29.670 --> 05:33.620
You know, I mean, uh...[br]Our robbin' the rich to feed the poor.

05:33.710 --> 05:37.550
Rob? That's a naughty word.[br]We never rob.

05:37.630 --> 05:41.770
We just sort of borrow a bit[br]from those who can afford it.

05:41.850 --> 05:45.380
"Borrow"?[br]Huh. Boy, are we in debt.

05:54.350 --> 05:59.070
That sounds like another collection day[br]for the poor, eh, Johnny boy?

05:59.160 --> 06:02.240
Yeah. Sweet charity.

06:37.060 --> 06:39.130
Taxes!

06:39.220 --> 06:43.180
Taxes! Beautiful, lovely taxes!

06:45.190 --> 06:48.200
S-Sire, you have[br]an absolute skill...

06:48.280 --> 06:51.140
for encouraging[br]contributions from the poor.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.480
To coin a phrase,[br]my dear counsellor:

06:53.570 --> 06:57.170
"Rob the poor[br]to feed the rich."

06:57.250 --> 06:58.820
Am I right?

06:58.920 --> 07:03.120
Tell me. What is the next stop,[br]uh, Sir Hiss?

07:03.210 --> 07:05.280
Uh, let me see, uh... Ooh!

07:05.380 --> 07:08.630
Yes, the next stop[br]is Nottingham, sire.

07:08.710 --> 07:11.540
Oh! The richest plum[br]of them all.

07:11.630 --> 07:14.800
Notting... ham.

07:17.050 --> 07:20.500
A perfect fit, sire.[br]Most becoming.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.420
You look regal, dignified...

07:22.510 --> 07:25.180
sincere, masterful,[br]noble, chival...

07:25.260 --> 07:27.340
D-D-D-D-Don't overdo it, Hiss.

07:29.320 --> 07:32.980
There.[br]That, I believe, does it.

07:33.070 --> 07:38.060
This crown gives me[br]a feeling of power! Power!

07:38.150 --> 07:40.110
Forgive me a cruel chuckle.

07:41.490 --> 07:43.400
Mm. Power. Hmm.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.900
And how well King Richard's crown[br]sits on your noble brow.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.240
Doesn't it?[br]Uh, King Richard?

07:52.330 --> 07:55.950
I've told you never[br]to mention my brother's name.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.830
A-A mere slip of the forked tongue,[br]Your Majesty.

07:59.930 --> 08:02.760
We're in this plot together,[br]if you don't mind my saying so.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.930
And remember, it was your idea[br]I hypnotized him, and...

08:06.010 --> 08:11.170
Ah-ah, I know.[br]And sent him off on that crazy crusade.

08:14.650 --> 08:16.720
Much to the sorrow[br]of the Queen Mother.

08:16.810 --> 08:19.020
Yeah. Mother.

08:20.900 --> 08:23.760
Mother always did[br]like Richard best.

08:27.150 --> 08:31.230
Your Highness, please don't do that,[br]if you don't mind my saying so.

08:31.330 --> 08:34.190
You see,[br]you have a very loud thumb.

08:36.250 --> 08:40.030
Hypnotism can rid you[br]of your psychosis-sis...

08:40.120 --> 08:42.500
so...

08:42.580 --> 08:46.170
easily.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.470
No! None of that![br]None of that.

08:48.550 --> 08:51.220
Well, I was only[br]trying to help.

08:51.300 --> 08:56.040
- I wonder. Silly serpent.[br]- "Silly serpent"?

08:56.130 --> 08:59.580
Now, look here. One more...[br]One more hiss out of you...

09:00.730 --> 09:05.350
Hiss... And you are walking[br]to Nottingham.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.650
Snakes don't walk.[br]They slither.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.430
Hmph. So there.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.830
Now, what about that for luck?[br]It's only a circus.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.830
A peanut operation.

09:48.920 --> 09:52.120
Peanuts? Why, you dunce,[br]that's the royal coach.

09:52.220 --> 09:55.220
- It's Prince John himself.[br]- The prince?

09:55.300 --> 09:57.540
Wait a minute.[br]There's a law against robbin' royalty.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.960
- I'll catch ya later.[br]- What?

10:00.050 --> 10:02.810
And miss this chance[br]to perform before royalty?

10:04.980 --> 10:07.440
Here we go again.

10:09.150 --> 10:13.190
Oo-de-lally! Oo-de-lally![br]Fortune-tellers!

10:13.270 --> 10:16.060
Fortunes forecast.[br]Lucky charms.

10:16.150 --> 10:19.580
Get the dope[br]with your horoscope.

10:19.660 --> 10:22.860
Fortune-tellers![br]How droll. Uh... Stop the coach.

10:22.950 --> 10:26.820
- Sire. Sire. They may be bandits.[br]- Oh, poppycock.

10:26.910 --> 10:30.830
Female bandits? What next?[br]Rubbish.

10:32.620 --> 10:35.880
My dear ladies,[br]uh, you have my permission...

10:35.960 --> 10:40.420
to kiss the royal hands,[br]whichever you like first.

10:40.510 --> 10:43.080
Mmm! Oh!

10:43.170 --> 10:46.710
How gracious and generous.

10:46.800 --> 10:49.440
Sire. Sire.[br]Did you see what they...

10:49.520 --> 10:51.890
Stop. Stop hissing in my ear.

10:57.020 --> 11:00.100
Did ya see? Did ya see?

11:00.190 --> 11:04.910
Hiss! Oh, you've[br]hissed your last hiss.

11:10.530 --> 11:12.190
Suspicious snake.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.440
Masterfully done,[br]Your Excellency.

11:16.530 --> 11:19.300
Now close your eyes[br]and concentrate.

11:19.380 --> 11:22.990
Close your eyes. Tight. Shut.[br]No peeking, sire.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.410
From the mists of time...

11:28.510 --> 11:31.130
come forth, spirits.

11:31.210 --> 11:32.950
Yoo-hoo!

11:33.050 --> 11:37.060
Okay, little fireflies.[br]Glow, babies. Glow.

11:37.140 --> 11:40.810
We're waiting. Ah... Oh!

11:40.890 --> 11:44.890
Look, sire. Look!

11:44.980 --> 11:47.190
Ah! Incredible.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.180
Floating spirits.

11:51.860 --> 11:54.980
Naughty, naughty.[br]You mustn't touch, young man.

11:55.070 --> 11:57.030
Oh, how dare you strike[br]the royal hand...

11:57.110 --> 12:00.980
Shh. Shh. You'll break the spell.[br]Just gaze into the crystal ball.

12:01.070 --> 12:04.740
Oo-de-lally. Oo-de-lall...

12:04.820 --> 12:08.250
Oh! A face appears.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.950
A crown is[br]on his noble brow.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.660
Oo-de-lally.[br]A crown! How exciting!

12:17.750 --> 12:20.930
His face is handsome...

12:21.010 --> 12:26.600
regal, majestic, lovable.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.010
A cuddly face.

12:29.100 --> 12:31.010
"Handsome, regal...

12:31.100 --> 12:33.560
majestic, lovable."

12:33.640 --> 12:35.880
Yes, yes. "Cuddly."

12:37.440 --> 12:41.820
Oh, that's me to a "T."[br]It really is, yes.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.190
Now what?

12:47.400 --> 12:52.370
I, uh... I see, um...[br]your illustrious name.

12:52.460 --> 12:54.950
I know my name![br]Get on with it!

12:55.040 --> 12:58.630
Your name will go down, down...

12:58.710 --> 13:01.280
down in history, of course.

13:01.380 --> 13:05.530
Yes! I knew it! I knew it![br]Do you hear that, Hiss?

13:05.630 --> 13:08.970
Oh, you can't...[br]He's in the basket.

13:09.050 --> 13:11.460
Do-Don't forget it.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.880
Hmm. What have we here?

13:15.970 --> 13:19.640
Solid gold hubcaps.

13:29.150 --> 13:32.850
Oo-de-lally. The jackpot.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.270
Robbed! I've been robbed!

14:14.360 --> 14:16.900
Hiss! You're never around[br]when I need you.

14:19.190 --> 14:21.860
- I've been robbed.[br]- Of course, you've been robbed!

14:21.940 --> 14:24.020
Oo-de-lally! Oo-de-lally!

14:24.110 --> 14:26.610
Fortunes forecast. Lucky charms.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.250
After them, you fools!

14:43.550 --> 14:46.420
No, no, no, no!

14:46.510 --> 14:50.040
I knew it. I knew it.[br]I just knew this would happen.

14:50.130 --> 14:52.040
I tried to warn you,[br]but, no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.290
You just had to... Ah! Ah! Ah!

14:54.390 --> 14:59.930
Seven years bad... Ooh! Luck.[br]That's what it is.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.970
Besides, you broke[br]your mother's mirror.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.220
Mommy.

15:07.690 --> 15:09.600
I've got a dirty thumb.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.360
Well, even though Prince John[br]offered a huge reward...

15:19.450 --> 15:21.160
for the capture of Robin Hood...

15:21.240 --> 15:25.370
that elusive rogue kept right on[br]robbing the rich to feed the poor.

15:25.450 --> 15:27.540
And believe me,[br]it's a good thing he did...

15:27.630 --> 15:29.540
because what with taxes and all...

15:29.630 --> 15:33.870
the poor folks of Nottingham[br]were starvin' to death.

15:33.970 --> 15:37.220
Uh-oh. Here comes[br]Old Bad News himself...

15:37.300 --> 15:40.550
the Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham.

15:40.630 --> 15:45.850
Every town[br]Has the taxes too

15:45.940 --> 15:51.010
And the taxes is due[br]Do- do-do-do-do

15:51.100 --> 15:56.340
Well, looky there.[br]Friar Tuck, the old do-gooder.

15:56.440 --> 15:58.360
He's out doin' good again.

16:03.490 --> 16:05.200
Well, good mornin', Friar Tuck.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.520
Shh, Otto, shh.[br]For you, Otto, from Robin Hood.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.550
Oh, God bless Robin Hood.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.010
It's the sheriff.[br]Hurry. Hide it quick.

16:23.090 --> 16:25.760
Here I come, ready or not.

16:27.420 --> 16:32.140
Well, greetings from your friendly[br]neighbourhood tax collector.

16:32.230 --> 16:34.850
Oh, take it easy on me, Sheriff.

16:34.930 --> 16:37.390
Wha-Wha-What with this busted leg[br]and all, you know...

16:37.480 --> 16:40.050
l-I'm way behind[br]in me work, Sheriff.

16:40.140 --> 16:44.730
I know, Otto, but you're way behind[br]with your taxes too.

16:44.820 --> 16:47.400
Oh, have a heart, Sheriff.

16:47.490 --> 16:50.060
Can't ya see he's laid up?

16:50.160 --> 16:53.100
Come on, Otto.[br]You'd better sit down and rest.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.870
Oh, thank you. Yes.

16:59.630 --> 17:02.630
Let me give you[br]a hand with that leg.

17:02.710 --> 17:07.500
Upsy-daisy. Bingo.

17:07.589 --> 17:10.250
Oh, what they won't[br]think of next.

17:14.220 --> 17:19.130
It smarts, don't it, Otto? But[br]Prince John says that taxes should hurt.

17:19.220 --> 17:23.140
Now, see here,[br]you-you evil, flint-hearted...

17:23.220 --> 17:27.089
Now, now, now, now,[br]save your sermon, preacher.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.600
It ain't Sunday, ya know.

17:32.110 --> 17:36.030
They call me a slob[br]But I do my job

17:37.450 --> 17:41.740
Happy birthday to you

17:41.820 --> 17:45.910
Happy birthday to you

17:46.000 --> 17:50.320
Happy birthday, dear Skippy

17:50.420 --> 17:57.320
Happy birthday to you

17:57.420 --> 18:01.350
Well, now, sonny, that box[br]is done up right pretty, ain't it?

18:01.430 --> 18:06.340
Well, Mr Sheriff, sir,[br]it's my birthday present, sir.

18:06.430 --> 18:09.300
It sure is.[br]Why don't ya open it?

18:11.390 --> 18:14.220
Oh, boy! One whole farthing!

18:15.940 --> 18:21.560
Have you no heart? We all scrimped[br]and saved to give it to him.

18:21.650 --> 18:25.570
Now, that's mighty "thoughty" of ya,[br]"widder" woman.

18:25.650 --> 18:30.560
The family that saves together,[br]pays together.

18:30.650 --> 18:33.330
Oh, now don't take it[br]so hard, sonny.

18:33.410 --> 18:36.580
Prince John wishes you[br]a happy birthday too.

18:36.660 --> 18:41.660
Alms. Alms.[br]Alms for the poor.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.500
Hmm. Well.

18:48.970 --> 18:52.330
Well, so far it's been[br]a cheerful morning.

18:52.430 --> 18:56.550
- Keep savin'.[br]- What a dirty trick.

18:56.640 --> 18:59.350
You poor old man.

18:59.430 --> 19:03.270
Do come in.[br]Come in and rest yourself.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.360
Thank ye kindly, Mother.[br]Thank ye.

19:06.440 --> 19:12.360
Tell me now. Did me old ears hear[br]someone singin' a birthday ditty?

19:12.440 --> 19:13.720
Yes, sir.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.530
And that mean, old sheriff...

19:16.610 --> 19:18.610
took my birthday present.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.860
Did he now?

19:20.950 --> 19:25.610
But be a stouthearted little lad,[br]and don't let it get ya down.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.080
Gee whiz![br]It's Robin Hood!

19:28.160 --> 19:30.740
Happy birthday, son.

19:30.830 --> 19:36.050
Oh, he's so handsome,[br]just like his reward posters.

19:36.130 --> 19:39.300
Tell me, young man,[br]how old are you today?

19:39.380 --> 19:41.960
Gosh. I'm seven years old,[br]goin' on eight.

19:42.050 --> 19:46.340
Seven? Well, that does make you[br]the man of the house.

19:46.430 --> 19:48.980
And I've got[br]just the right present for you.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.390
For me?

19:51.480 --> 19:55.480
Gee, thanks,[br]Mr Robin Hood, sir.

19:55.560 --> 20:00.390
- Hey, how do I look, huh?[br]- Not much like Mr Robin Hood.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.190
She's right.[br]There is something missing.

20:03.270 --> 20:07.120
Of course! There you go.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.400
Boy, oh, boy![br]Now how do I look?

20:12.290 --> 20:16.120
- The hat's too big.[br]- Shh! Mind your manners.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.410
Yes. Mind your manners.

20:20.210 --> 20:22.700
Don't worry.[br]You'll grow into it, young man.

20:22.800 --> 20:25.370
Oo-de-lally![br]I'm gonna try it out.

20:25.470 --> 20:30.090
Goodbye, Mr Robin Hood.[br]Come again on my birthday.

20:31.970 --> 20:35.590
Oh, you have made his birthday[br]a wonderful one.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.840
How can I ever thank ya?

20:37.940 --> 20:41.600
I only wish I could do more.[br]Here.

20:41.690 --> 20:43.590
Now keep your chin up.

20:43.690 --> 20:47.600
Someday, there'll be happiness[br]again in Nottingham. You'll see.

20:47.690 --> 20:52.940
Oh, Robin Hood, you've risked so much[br]to keep our hopes alive.

20:53.030 --> 20:56.480
Bless you. Bless you.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.410
Gee. Did Robin Hood[br]really give it to you?

21:11.490 --> 21:13.870
Yeah. And this is[br]his own hat too.

21:13.950 --> 21:16.410
Gee. I'd sure like[br]to shoot your bow and arrow.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.740
- Let me try it, Skippy.[br]- Oh, no, you don't.

21:18.830 --> 21:22.340
- I'm gonna shoot it first.[br]- You're pointin' it too high.

21:22.420 --> 21:24.830
I'm not either. Watch this.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.660
Uh-oh. Now ya done it.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.250
Right in Prince John's backyard.

21:44.850 --> 21:46.760
Skippy, you can't[br]go in there.

21:46.850 --> 21:49.720
Yeah. Prince John'll[br]chop off your head.

21:51.190 --> 21:53.320
Like this.

21:53.410 --> 21:55.480
Oh, I don't care.[br]I gotta get my arrow.

21:55.570 --> 21:58.110
Wait a minute.[br]Toby might tattle on ya.

21:58.200 --> 22:02.240
- Yeah, Toby. You gotta take the oath.[br]- An oath?

22:02.330 --> 22:05.330
Put your hand on your heart[br]and cross your eyes.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.490
Spider, snakes[br]and a lizard head.

22:09.590 --> 22:12.250
"Spiders, snakes[br]and a lizard's head."

22:12.340 --> 22:15.170
If I tattletale,[br]I'll die till I'm dead.

22:15.260 --> 22:19.460
"If I tattletale,[br]I'll die till I'm dead."

22:31.690 --> 22:34.010
Why, it's your turn[br]to serve, Marian, dear.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.340
Are you ready, Lady Kluck?

22:35.440 --> 22:38.730
Oh, as your lady-in-waiting,[br]I'm waiting.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.570
I'm getting too old for this. Oh.

22:51.660 --> 22:54.700
- Klucky, that was a good shot.[br]- Oh! Not bad yourself, dear.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.700
Oh, my girdle's killing me.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.920
- Where is it? Did you lose it?[br]- Well, it must be in there someplace.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.630
Oh, Klucky, you look so silly.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.560
Oh, look. There it is behind you.

23:15.020 --> 23:19.140
Oh! Well, hello.[br]Where did you come from?

23:19.230 --> 23:22.230
Oh, please,[br]don't tell Prince John.

23:22.310 --> 23:24.730
Mama said he'll chop off my head.

23:24.820 --> 23:27.310
Oh, don't be afraid.[br]You've done nothing wrong.

23:27.400 --> 23:30.490
Oh, Marian.[br]What a bonny, wee bunny.

23:30.570 --> 23:33.740
Now, who does this young archer[br]remind you of?

23:33.820 --> 23:39.060
Oh. Well, upon my word,[br]the notorious Robin Hood.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.570
That's right! Why, only[br]Robin Hood wears a hat like that.

23:43.670 --> 23:46.160
Yeah, and look at[br]this keen Robin Hood bow.

23:50.290 --> 23:56.090
Oh, Marian. Don't look around,[br]but I do believe we're surrounded.

23:56.180 --> 24:00.250
- Oh, mercy.[br]- He snitched on us.

24:00.350 --> 24:03.380
It's all right, children.[br]Don't be afraid.

24:03.470 --> 24:06.640
- Please come here.[br]- Do you think it's safe?

24:06.720 --> 24:12.100
- That's Maid Marian.[br]- Mama said she's awful nice. Come on!

24:13.360 --> 24:17.930
He-Hey, you guys, not so fast.[br]Wait for me.

24:18.030 --> 24:20.270
I told Skippy[br]he was shooting too high.

24:20.360 --> 24:25.780
I'm so very glad he did.[br]And now I get to meet all of you.

24:25.860 --> 24:29.780
- Gee. You're very beautiful.[br]- Are you gonna marry Robin Hood?

24:29.870 --> 24:35.110
Mama said you and Robin Hood[br]are sweethearts.

24:35.210 --> 24:40.630
Well, um, you see, that was several[br]years ago, before I left for London.

24:40.710 --> 24:45.960
- Did he ever kiss ya?[br]- Well, uh, no.

24:46.050 --> 24:48.800
But he carved our initials[br]on this tree.

24:51.050 --> 24:54.470
- I remember it so well.[br]- You gonna have any kids?

24:54.550 --> 24:56.790
My mama gots a lot of kids.

24:56.890 --> 24:59.650
Oh, he's probably[br]forgotten all about me.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.970
Oh, not Robin Hood.

25:02.070 --> 25:05.650
I bet he'll storm the castle gates,[br]fight the guards...

25:05.730 --> 25:08.480
rescue ya and drag ya[br]out to Sherwood Forest.

25:08.570 --> 25:12.980
Now, just a moment there,[br]young man.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.290
You've forgotten Prince John.

25:15.370 --> 25:18.650
That old Prince John[br]don't scare me none.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.500
I'm scared of Prince John.[br]He's cranky.

25:24.580 --> 25:29.500
I, Prince John,[br]challenge you to a duel.

25:29.590 --> 25:32.840
Take that. And that. And this.

25:34.970 --> 25:37.180
Death to tyrants!

25:40.300 --> 25:42.880
Slice him to pieces!

25:42.970 --> 25:46.010
Oh, save me, my hero.[br]Save me.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.140
Oh! Ouch![br]That's not fair.

25:50.230 --> 25:51.690
Mommy!

25:53.020 --> 25:55.970
That's Prince John, all right!

25:57.480 --> 26:02.370
- Ya-hoo! Now I gotcha![br]- Oh! Mercy! Mercy!

26:05.200 --> 26:08.450
He got me. I'm dying.

26:08.540 --> 26:11.150
- Ohh![br]- Did I hurt ya? Huh?

26:11.250 --> 26:16.080
Now, this is the part where you drag[br]your lady fair off to Sherwood Forest.

26:17.340 --> 26:19.550
Come on, lady fair. Let's go!

26:21.010 --> 26:25.410
Oh, Robin,[br]you're so brave and impetuous.

26:26.760 --> 26:31.180
Oh. So this is Sherwood Forest.

26:31.270 --> 26:35.480
Yeah, I guess so.[br]Well, now what are we gonna do?

26:35.560 --> 26:39.720
Well, usually, the hero[br]gives his fair lady a kiss.

26:39.810 --> 26:43.230
A kiss? Oh, that's sissy stuff.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.940
Well, if you won't, then I will.

26:48.820 --> 26:50.730
They're kissing.

27:22.350 --> 27:25.690
Ah, me. Young love.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.090
Oh, it's a grand thing.

27:29.810 --> 27:33.190
Oh, Klucky, surely he must know[br]how much I still love him.

27:33.280 --> 27:36.200
But, of course, my dear.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.450
Believe me, someday soon...

27:39.530 --> 27:43.610
your uncle, King Richard,[br]will have an outlaw for an in-law.

27:45.660 --> 27:49.960
Oh, Klucky! But when? When?

27:50.040 --> 27:52.580
Oh, patience, my dear. Patience.

27:52.670 --> 27:56.660
Remember, absence[br]makes the heart grow fonder.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.210
Or forgetful.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.890
Oh, I've been away so long.

28:02.970 --> 28:05.550
What if he's forgotten[br]all about me?

28:17.730 --> 28:22.140
Hey, lover boy. How's that grub[br]comin', man? I'm starved.

28:24.570 --> 28:28.480
Rob? Robin.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.480
Robaire.

28:31.570 --> 28:35.200
- Hey![br]- Hmm? What? What do you say?

28:35.290 --> 28:38.160
Ah, forget it.[br]Your mind's not on food.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.780
You're thinking about somebody[br]with long eyelashes...

28:41.880 --> 28:44.450
and you're smellin'[br]that sweet perfume.

28:47.630 --> 28:51.790
- Hey! Whoa! L-It's boiling over.[br]- You're burnin' the chow!

28:53.760 --> 28:58.140
Sorry, Johnny. I guess I was[br]thinking about Maid Marian again.

28:58.220 --> 29:02.630
I can't help it.[br]I love her, Johnny.

29:02.720 --> 29:06.070
Look, why don't ya stop[br]moanin' and mopin' around?

29:06.150 --> 29:09.770
- Just-Just marry the girl.[br]- Marry her?

29:09.860 --> 29:13.110
You don't just walk up to a girl,[br]hand her a bouquet and say...

29:13.190 --> 29:15.980
"Hey, remember me? We were kids[br]together. Will you marry me?"

29:16.070 --> 29:19.490
No, it just isn't done that way.

29:19.570 --> 29:22.950
Ah, come on, Robby.[br]Climb the castle walls.

29:24.210 --> 29:28.500
Sweep her off her feet.[br]Carry her off in style.

29:28.580 --> 29:33.210
It's no use, Johnny. I've thought it[br]all out, and it just wouldn't work.

29:33.290 --> 29:37.840
- Besides, what have I got to offer her?[br]- Well, for one thing, you can't cook.

29:37.930 --> 29:41.510
I'm serious, Johnny.[br]She's a highborn lady of quality.

29:41.600 --> 29:46.960
- So she's got class. So what?[br]- I'm an outlaw. That's what.

29:47.050 --> 29:50.170
That's no life for a lovely lady.[br]Always on the run.

29:50.260 --> 29:55.010
- What kind of a future is that?[br]- Oh, for heaven's sake, son.

29:55.110 --> 29:57.350
You're no outlaw.

29:57.440 --> 30:01.280
Why, someday,[br]you'll be called a great hero.

30:01.360 --> 30:05.190
A hero? Did you hear that, Johnny?[br]We've just been pardoned.

30:06.450 --> 30:09.070
That's a gas.[br]We ain't even been arrested yet.

30:09.160 --> 30:12.190
All right, laugh,[br]you two rogues...

30:12.290 --> 30:15.490
but there's gonna be[br]a big to-do in Nottingham.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.370
Well-done, ain't it?

30:20.460 --> 30:26.050
Old Prince John's havin' a championship[br]archery tournament tomorrow.

30:26.130 --> 30:27.870
Archery tournament?

30:27.970 --> 30:31.250
Old Rob could win that[br]standin' on his head, huh, Rob?

30:31.340 --> 30:35.970
Thank you, Little John,[br]but I'm sure we're not invited.

30:36.050 --> 30:41.560
No, but there's somebody who'll be[br]very disappointed if you don't come.

30:41.650 --> 30:46.800
Yeah. Old Bushel Britches,[br]the Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham.

30:46.900 --> 30:50.070
No. Maid Marian.

30:50.150 --> 30:53.080
- Maid Marian?[br]- Yeah.

30:53.160 --> 30:56.330
She-She's gonna give a kiss[br]to the winner.

30:56.410 --> 30:58.820
Kiss to the winner!

30:58.910 --> 31:02.780
Oo-de-lally. Come on, Johnny.[br]What are we waiting for?

31:02.870 --> 31:07.760
Wait a minute, Rob. Hold it. That place[br]will be crawlin' with soldiers.

31:08.760 --> 31:11.510
Aha. But remember...

31:11.590 --> 31:15.420
faint hearts[br]never won fair lady.

31:15.510 --> 31:18.460
Fear not, my friends.

31:18.550 --> 31:21.920
This will be[br]my greatest performance.

31:53.330 --> 31:56.450
Hiss, this is a red-letter day.

31:56.550 --> 32:00.700
A coup d'etat,[br]to coin a Norman phrase.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.460
Ooh. Oh, yes, indeed, sire.

32:03.550 --> 32:07.500
Your plan to capture Robin Hood[br]in public is sheer genius.

32:08.880 --> 32:12.590
Hiss, no one sits higher[br]than the king.

32:12.680 --> 32:15.600
Must I remind you, Hiss?

32:17.060 --> 32:20.310
Do... Do forgive me, sire.[br]I didn't mean to...

32:20.390 --> 32:23.140
My trap is baited and set.

32:23.230 --> 32:28.230
And then revenge![br]Ah! Revenge!

32:28.320 --> 32:33.030
Shh. Not so loud, sire.[br]Remember, only you and I know.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.900
And your s-secret is my s-secret.

32:35.990 --> 32:38.820
Stop. Stop hissing in my ear.

32:38.910 --> 32:41.130
Secret? What secret?

32:41.210 --> 32:44.290
Why, the capture[br]of Robin Hood, sire.

32:44.380 --> 32:47.040
That insolent blackguard.

32:47.130 --> 32:51.080
Ooh! I'll show him[br]who wears the crown!

32:51.170 --> 32:53.870
I share your loathing, sire.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.560
That scurrilous scoundrel who fooled you[br]with that silly disguise...

32:57.640 --> 33:00.810
who dared to rob you[br]and make you look so utterly ridiculous.

33:00.890 --> 33:03.590
Enough!

33:03.680 --> 33:06.770
Hiss, you deliberately dodged.

33:06.850 --> 33:10.350
But-But-But, sire, please...

33:10.430 --> 33:14.650
Stop snivelling and hold still.

33:17.610 --> 33:19.520
Thank you, sire.

33:19.610 --> 33:22.190
Oh, Klucky, I'm so excited.

33:22.280 --> 33:24.350
But how will I recognize him?

33:24.450 --> 33:27.160
Oh, he'll let you know somehow.

33:27.250 --> 33:32.380
That young rogue of yours[br]is full of surprises, my dear.

33:32.460 --> 33:36.450
There she is, Little John.[br]Isn't she beautiful?

33:36.540 --> 33:40.950
Cool it, lover boy. Your heart's[br]runnin' away with your head.

33:41.040 --> 33:44.720
Ah, stop worrying.[br]This disguise would fool my own mother.

33:44.800 --> 33:50.670
Yeah. But your mom ain't here.[br]You gotta fool Old Bushel Britches.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.930
- Sheriff, Your Honour?[br]- Yeah.

33:57.020 --> 34:02.220
Meetin' ya face-to-face[br]is a real treat. A real treat.

34:02.320 --> 34:04.730
Well, now, thank you.

34:04.820 --> 34:07.600
Oh... Excuse me. I gotta go[br]win this tournament.

34:08.690 --> 34:10.900
Hey, old Rob's not a bad actor.

34:10.989 --> 34:15.150
But wait'll he sees this scene[br]I lay on Prince John.

34:17.620 --> 34:21.070
Ah! Me lord.

34:21.170 --> 34:24.699
My esteemed royal sovereign[br]of the realm.

34:24.790 --> 34:27.739
The head man himself.

34:27.830 --> 34:30.139
You're beautiful.

34:31.760 --> 34:34.050
He has style, hey, Hiss?

34:39.850 --> 34:42.510
Ya took the words[br]right outta my mouth, P.J.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.639
P.J. I like that.[br]Do you know, I do.

34:45.730 --> 34:48.980
Hiss, put it on my luggage. P.J.

34:51.070 --> 34:53.280
P.J. Yes.

34:54.730 --> 34:58.890
And you?[br]Who might you be, sir?

34:58.980 --> 35:02.940
I am Sir Reginald,[br]Duke of Chutney.

35:03.040 --> 35:06.820
And don't stick[br]your tongue out at me, kid.

35:06.910 --> 35:11.400
And now, Your Mightiness,[br]allow me to lay some protocol on you.

35:11.500 --> 35:15.830
Oh, no. Forgive me,[br]but I lose more jewels that way than...

35:15.930 --> 35:20.000
- Please sit down.[br]- Thanks, P.J.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.670
Couldn't get a better seat[br]than this, could ya? The royal box.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.680
Oh! Hey! Hey, what the...

35:25.760 --> 35:28.170
Oh, uh, excuse me, buster.

35:28.260 --> 35:32.480
"Buster"? You, sir,[br]have taken my seat.

35:35.610 --> 35:38.800
Hiss, with you around,[br]who needs a court jester?

35:44.190 --> 35:49.540
Now get out there and keep[br]your snake eyes open for you know who.

35:49.620 --> 35:54.190
You... You-You mean, l...[br]I'm being dismissed?

35:54.290 --> 35:57.730
You heard His Mightiness.[br]Move it, creepy. Get lost.

35:57.830 --> 36:00.920
Be gone, long one.

36:01.010 --> 36:04.200
What cheek! "Creepy.

36:04.300 --> 36:07.470
Buster. Long one."

36:07.550 --> 36:10.330
Who does that dopey duke[br]think he is?

36:10.420 --> 36:14.470
- Now, he's up to somethin', Friar.[br]- Yeah. Come on.

37:11.890 --> 37:14.130
Ah, Your Ladyship.

37:14.230 --> 37:16.630
Beggin' your pardon,[br]but it's a great honour...

37:16.730 --> 37:20.570
to be shootin' for the favour[br]of a lovely lady like yourself.

37:20.660 --> 37:24.600
- I hopes I win the kiss.[br]- Oh!

37:28.200 --> 37:32.150
Well, thank you,[br]my thin-legged archer.

37:32.240 --> 37:36.490
I wish you luck[br]with all my heart.

37:36.590 --> 37:39.530
Hmm. I wonder.

37:43.420 --> 37:48.660
Your Highness, with your royal[br]permission, we are ready to begin.

37:48.750 --> 37:51.340
Proceed, Captain.

37:51.430 --> 37:55.890
The Tournament of the Golden Arrow[br]will now begin.

38:25.380 --> 38:26.570
Yea, Dad.

38:29.830 --> 38:32.590
Boo!

38:40.180 --> 38:45.300
A perfect bullseye.[br]Well, well.

38:45.390 --> 38:49.430
Yeah. That's what ya call[br]pullin' it back and lettin' it go, P.J.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.650
I'm gonna win[br]that golden arrow...

38:51.730 --> 38:54.220
and then I'm gonna present meself[br]to the lovely Maid Marian...

38:54.320 --> 38:59.060
Listen, scissor bill, if you shoot[br]half as good as you blabber-mouth...

38:59.150 --> 39:00.560
you're better than Robin Hood.

39:00.650 --> 39:03.990
"Robin Hood," he says. Wowee!

39:04.070 --> 39:08.070
I'm tip-top, all right,[br]but I'm not as good as he is.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.540
That kid's got class,[br]ain't he, P.J.?

39:18.620 --> 39:22.220
Indeed he has, Reggie.

39:22.300 --> 39:26.590
Bravo! Bravo! Yes.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.600
Oh, um, by the way...

39:29.680 --> 39:34.960
I hear you're having a bit of trouble[br]gettin' your hands on that Robin Hood.

39:35.050 --> 39:39.220
He's scared of me. That's what he is.[br]You notice he didn't show up here today.

39:39.320 --> 39:43.220
Heh! I could spot him[br]through them phoney disguises.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.470
It's him! It's Robin Hood!

39:46.900 --> 39:50.230
I just can't wait[br]till I tell His Majesty.

40:00.790 --> 40:02.750
Unhand me, you...

40:02.830 --> 40:05.280
Please. Please. I don't drink.

40:08.510 --> 40:10.750
Attention, everyone.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.620
The final contestants are:

40:13.720 --> 40:17.250
The Honourable Sheriff of Nottingham.

40:21.220 --> 40:26.260
And the spindle-legged stork[br]from Devonshire.

40:30.060 --> 40:34.800
My dear, I suspect you favour[br]the gangly youth, hmm?

40:34.900 --> 40:38.560
Uh... Why, yes, sire.

40:38.650 --> 40:41.910
Well, at least he amuses me.

40:41.990 --> 40:44.400
Coincidentally, my dear young lady...

40:44.490 --> 40:48.650
he amuses me too.

40:48.740 --> 40:51.580
For the final shoot-out...

40:51.660 --> 40:55.290
move the target back 30 paces.

40:55.380 --> 40:59.370
You heard him, Nutsy. Get goin'.[br]Move it, you birdbrain.

41:01.090 --> 41:03.620
And remember[br]what you're supposed to do.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.620
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.

41:14.560 --> 41:17.760
Well, that shot[br]wins the golden arrow...

41:17.850 --> 41:20.300
the kiss[br]and the whole caboodle.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.480
Yea! He did it![br]He did it! He did it!

42:02.970 --> 42:05.040
Archer, I commend you.

42:05.130 --> 42:10.800
And because of your superior skill[br]you shall get what is coming to you.

42:10.880 --> 42:15.220
Our royal congratulations.

42:15.310 --> 42:17.840
Oh, thank you kindly,[br]Your Highness.

42:17.940 --> 42:22.930
Meetin' you face-to-face,[br]Your High and Mighty, is a real treat.

42:23.020 --> 42:26.470
Release the royal fingers. Ah!

42:28.070 --> 42:31.480
And now, I name you the winner.

42:31.580 --> 42:33.980
Or more appropriately...

42:35.830 --> 42:37.020
the loser.

42:40.790 --> 42:42.370
Seize him.

42:47.010 --> 42:48.910
I sentence you to sudden...

42:49.010 --> 42:53.830
instant and even immediate death.

42:53.920 --> 42:57.250
Oh, no! Oh!

42:57.340 --> 43:00.920
Please. Please, sire.

43:01.020 --> 43:05.590
I beg of you to spare his life.[br]Please, have mercy.

43:05.690 --> 43:08.840
My dear, emotional lady,[br]why should I?

43:08.940 --> 43:13.270
- Because I love him, Your Highness.[br]- Love him?

43:13.360 --> 43:17.230
And does this prisoner[br]return your love?

43:19.700 --> 43:24.270
Marian, my darling,[br]I love you more than life itself.

43:24.370 --> 43:27.770
Ah. Young love.

43:27.870 --> 43:33.660
Your pleas have not fallen[br]upon a heart of stone.

43:33.750 --> 43:36.790
But traitors to the crown[br]must die!

43:36.880 --> 43:39.800
Traitor to the crown?[br]That crown belongs to King Richard.

43:39.880 --> 43:43.540
- Long live King Richard![br]- Long live King Richard!

43:43.630 --> 43:46.170
Enough! I am king!

43:46.270 --> 43:48.210
King! King!

43:48.310 --> 43:51.840
Ah! Off with his head!

44:04.650 --> 44:06.770
Oh, no.

44:08.450 --> 44:13.440
Stop! Executioners, stop![br]Hold your axe!

44:13.530 --> 44:17.490
Okay, big shot. Now tell 'em[br]to untie my buddy, or I'll...

44:17.580 --> 44:19.950
Sheriff, release my buddy.

44:21.210 --> 44:23.490
I mean, release the prisoner!

44:23.590 --> 44:26.250
Untie the prisoner?

44:26.340 --> 44:28.910
You heard what he said,[br]Bushel Britches!

44:29.000 --> 44:31.630
Sheriff, I make the rules.

44:31.720 --> 44:34.670
And since I am the head man...

44:34.760 --> 44:37.920
Not so hard, you mean thing.

44:38.010 --> 44:41.590
Let him go, for heaven sakes![br]Let him go!

44:41.680 --> 44:45.420
Yee-hee![br]Love conquers all!

44:50.570 --> 44:52.640
I owe my life to you,[br]my darling.

44:52.740 --> 44:55.180
I couldn't have lived[br]without you, Robin.

44:56.570 --> 44:59.240
There's somethin' funny[br]goin' on around here.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.360
Now, P.J., tell my pal[br]to kiss Maid Marian...

45:02.460 --> 45:04.490
or I've just found[br]a new pincushion.

45:04.580 --> 45:05.820
Why, you...

45:07.670 --> 45:11.240
Kill him! Don't stand there![br]Kill him!

45:26.260 --> 45:30.130
Don't hurt me. No! No! Don't hurt me![br]Help! Help!

45:35.020 --> 45:37.140
Kill him!

45:37.230 --> 45:41.310
Run for it, lassie![br]This is no place for a lady!

45:45.940 --> 45:48.530
Take that, you scoundrel!

45:48.620 --> 45:50.820
Help! Robin, help!

45:55.460 --> 45:57.250
Marian, my love,[br]will you marry me?

45:57.330 --> 45:59.950
Oh, darling, I thought[br]you'd never ask me.

46:02.170 --> 46:06.000
Oh, but you could have chose[br]a more romantic setting.

46:06.090 --> 46:08.420
- And for our honeymoon, London![br]- Yes!

46:08.510 --> 46:10.000
- Normandy![br]- Yes!

46:10.090 --> 46:12.000
- Sunny Spain![br]- Why not?

46:14.590 --> 46:17.510
Ooh, what a main event this is.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.180
Yippee! Ya-hoo! Yippee!

46:21.270 --> 46:23.180
What a beautiful brawl.

46:31.730 --> 46:34.980
Hey! Who's driving[br]this flying umbrella?

46:42.370 --> 46:45.120
- We'll have six children.[br]- Six?

46:45.200 --> 46:47.240
Oh, a dozen, at least.

46:50.340 --> 46:53.620
Take that!

46:57.220 --> 46:59.880
Attention, everyone...

47:33.200 --> 47:35.110
Stop the girl!

47:36.170 --> 47:39.450
Take that, you scurvy knave!

47:39.550 --> 47:41.450
Seize the fat one!

48:17.910 --> 48:21.690
Long live King Richard![br]Ya-hoo!

48:24.790 --> 48:27.540
Hiss! You're never around[br]when I need you.

48:27.630 --> 48:30.160
Coming. Coming.

48:31.550 --> 48:35.370
For I'm a jolly good fellow[br]For I'm a jolly good fellow

48:38.140 --> 48:41.060
Oh! Oh, there you are, old boy.

48:41.140 --> 48:45.960
P.J., you won't believe this,[br]but the stork is really Robin Hood.

48:46.060 --> 48:48.050
Robin Hood.

48:54.570 --> 48:56.980
Get out of that, if you can.

49:09.100 --> 49:14.260
Love, it seems like only yesterday

49:16.020 --> 49:20.110
You werejust a child at play

49:22.190 --> 49:27.910
Now you're all grown up[br]inside of me

49:27.990 --> 49:32.120
Oh, how fast those moments flee

49:33.910 --> 49:38.540
Once we watched a lazy world go by

49:39.960 --> 49:44.050
Now the days seem to fly

49:45.800 --> 49:51.670
Life is brief[br]But when it's gone

49:51.760 --> 49:55.690
Love goes on and on

50:02.350 --> 50:05.690
Love will live

50:08.600 --> 50:11.490
Love will last

50:16.120 --> 50:21.950
Love goes on and on and on

50:22.030 --> 50:26.550
Once we watched a lazy world go by

50:28.170 --> 50:31.790
Now the days seem to fly

50:33.300 --> 50:39.660
Life is brief[br]But when it's gone

50:39.760 --> 50:44.730
Love goes on and on

50:49.140 --> 50:52.590
Oh, Robin,[br]what a beautiful night.

50:52.690 --> 50:55.440
I wish it would never end.

50:55.520 --> 51:00.200
Surprise![br]Long live Robin Hood!

51:00.280 --> 51:01.990
Hooray! Hooray!

51:02.070 --> 51:04.200
And long live Maid Marian!

51:04.280 --> 51:06.280
Bravo! Bravo!

51:06.360 --> 51:08.910
Hear, hear![br]Bravo! Bravo! Hooray!

51:10.490 --> 51:14.250
And down with[br]that scurvy Prince John.

51:14.330 --> 51:15.500
Yeah.

51:17.340 --> 51:19.420
Oh, the world will sing[br]of an English king

51:19.500 --> 51:21.590
A thousand years from now

51:21.670 --> 51:26.170
And not because he passed some laws[br]or had that lofty brow

51:26.250 --> 51:30.260
While bonny good King Richard[br]leads the great crusade he's on

51:30.350 --> 51:34.810
We'll all have to slave away[br]for that good-for-nothin'John

51:34.890 --> 51:39.270
Incredible as he is inept[br]whenever the history books are kept

51:39.350 --> 51:43.570
They'll call him[br]the phoney King of England

51:43.650 --> 51:47.350
A pox on the phoney King of England

52:00.710 --> 52:05.080
He sits alone on a giant throne[br]pretendin'he's the king

52:05.170 --> 52:09.210
A little tyke who's rather like[br]a puppet on a string

52:09.290 --> 52:13.550
And he throws an angry tantrum[br]if he cannot have his way

52:13.640 --> 52:18.760
And then he calls for Mom[br]while he's suckin' his thumb.

52:18.850 --> 52:22.300
You see, he doesn't want to play.

52:22.390 --> 52:26.720
Too late to be known as John the First[br]He's sure to known as John the Worst

52:26.810 --> 52:30.730
A pox on that phoney King of England

52:30.820 --> 52:33.360
Lay that country on me, babe.

52:37.820 --> 52:39.740
Come on, Johnny!

52:40.860 --> 52:42.780
Go, man, go!

53:05.340 --> 53:09.850
While he taxes us to pieces[br]and he robs us of our bread

53:09.930 --> 53:14.180
King Richard's crown keeps slippin'down[br]around that pointed head, ah

53:14.260 --> 53:18.650
But while there is a merry man[br]in Robin's wily pack

53:18.730 --> 53:22.940
We'll find a way to make him pay[br]and steal our money back

53:23.020 --> 53:25.430
A minute before he knows we're there

53:25.530 --> 53:28.610
Old Rob'll snatch his underwear.

53:32.950 --> 53:37.200
The breezy and uneasy King of England

53:37.290 --> 53:39.370
The snivellin', grovellin'

53:39.450 --> 53:41.540
Measly, weaselly

53:41.620 --> 53:43.710
Blabberin', jabberin'

53:43.790 --> 53:45.830
Jibberin', jabberin'

53:45.910 --> 53:48.050
Plunderin', plottin'

53:48.130 --> 53:50.220
Wheelin', dealin'

53:50.300 --> 53:55.720
PrinceJohn[br]That phoney King of England, yeah

54:03.100 --> 54:07.560
He throws an angry tantrum[br]if he cannot have his way

54:07.650 --> 54:11.860
He calls for Mom and sucks his thumb[br]and doesn't want to play

54:11.940 --> 54:14.060
Too late to be known as John the First

54:14.150 --> 54:17.910
He's sure to be known[br]as John the Worst

54:17.990 --> 54:20.950
How about that?

54:21.030 --> 54:24.730
That's P.J. To a "T."[br]Let me try. Let me try.

54:29.080 --> 54:34.760
Too late to be known as John the First[br]He's sure to be known as John the Worst

54:36.340 --> 54:40.170
The fabulous, marvellous,[br]merciful, ch-ch-chivalrous...

54:40.260 --> 54:42.010
Oh, ya got it all wrong, Hiss.

54:42.090 --> 54:44.500
The snivellin', grovellin', weaselly...

54:44.590 --> 54:47.940
Enough!

54:48.020 --> 54:53.230
But-But, uh, sire, it's a big hit.[br]The whole village is singin' it.

54:53.310 --> 54:56.310
Oh, they are, are they?

54:56.400 --> 55:00.340
Well, they'll be[br]singing a different tune.

55:00.440 --> 55:04.310
Double the taxes.[br]Triple the taxes.

55:04.410 --> 55:06.980
Squeeze every last drop...

55:07.070 --> 55:10.940
out of those insolent,[br]musical peasants.

55:16.860 --> 55:21.860
Man, oh, man. That Prince John[br]sure made good his threat.

55:23.790 --> 55:28.940
And his helpless subjects paid dearly[br]for his humiliation, believe me.

55:30.750 --> 55:34.090
Taxes, taxes, taxes.

55:34.170 --> 55:37.700
Why, he taxed the heart and soul[br]out of the poor people of Nottingham.

55:39.550 --> 55:43.590
And if you couldn't pay your taxes,[br]you went to jail.

55:45.340 --> 55:50.230
Yep. I'm in here too.[br]Nottingham was in deep trouble.

55:53.690 --> 55:55.930
Every town

55:58.270 --> 56:01.020
Has its ups and downs

56:03.860 --> 56:05.910
Sometimes ups

56:09.200 --> 56:11.330
Outnumber the downs

56:13.870 --> 56:16.700
But not in Nottingham

56:18.990 --> 56:22.090
I'm inclined to believe

56:24.840 --> 56:27.330
If we weren't so down

56:29.880 --> 56:32.170
We'd up and leave

56:34.840 --> 56:37.730
We'd up and fly

56:37.810 --> 56:42.550
If we had wings for flyin'

56:42.640 --> 56:47.130
Can't ya see the tears we're cryin'

56:47.230 --> 56:53.100
Can't there be some happiness for me

56:55.240 --> 56:58.320
Not in Nottingham

57:46.360 --> 57:48.320
Friar Tuck.

57:49.450 --> 57:51.520
I don't think anyone[br]is coming.

57:51.610 --> 57:55.540
You're right, Sexton, but maybe[br]the sound of this church bell...

57:55.620 --> 57:58.460
will bring those poor people[br]some comfort.

58:01.080 --> 58:05.490
We must do what we can[br]to keep their hopes alive.

58:08.290 --> 58:13.350
Oh. How can there be any hope[br]with that tyrant Prince John...

58:13.430 --> 58:16.680
taxing the heart and soul[br]out of the poor people?

58:16.760 --> 58:19.560
Yes, those poor people.

58:19.640 --> 58:23.680
Look. Our poor box is like our church.

58:23.780 --> 58:25.680
Empty.

58:33.440 --> 58:37.360
Friar Tuck.[br]We've saved this.

58:37.450 --> 58:41.040
It's not much,[br]but please take it for the poor.

58:41.120 --> 58:43.790
Your last farthing?

58:43.870 --> 58:46.280
Ah, little sister.

58:46.370 --> 58:49.540
No one can give more than that.

58:49.620 --> 58:51.860
Bless you both.

58:51.960 --> 58:56.010
Oh, we were just saving it[br]for a rainy day.

58:56.090 --> 58:58.000
Well, it's rainin' now.

58:59.590 --> 59:02.850
- Things can't get worse.[br]- Howdy, Friar.

59:02.930 --> 59:06.680
Well, it looks like I dropped by[br]just in time.

59:06.760 --> 59:09.680
What does that big-bellied bully[br]want here?

59:09.760 --> 59:12.400
Father, shh.

59:12.480 --> 59:16.180
Hmm. Well, what have we got here?

59:16.270 --> 59:21.350
Now, just a minute, Sheriff.[br]Th-Th-Th-Th-That's the poor box!

59:21.440 --> 59:26.870
It sure is, and I'll just take it[br]for poor Prince John.

59:26.950 --> 59:28.370
Every little bit helps.

59:28.450 --> 59:32.070
Ooh. You put that back.

59:32.160 --> 59:36.030
And His Majesty[br]also blesses you, little sister.

59:36.120 --> 59:38.360
You thievin' scoundrel!

59:38.460 --> 59:41.970
Now, take it easy, Friar.[br]I'm just doin' my duty.

59:42.050 --> 59:43.630
Collectin' taxes...

59:43.720 --> 59:48.790
for that arrogant, greedy,[br]ruthless, no-good Prince John?

59:48.880 --> 59:51.800
Listen, Friar.[br]You're mighty preachy...

59:51.890 --> 59:56.180
and you gonna preach your neck[br]right into a hangman's noose.

59:56.260 --> 59:58.730
Get outta my church!

59:58.810 --> 01:00:02.650
- Out! Out! Out! Out![br]- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:04.610
Oh, dear me.

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:07.100
You want taxes?

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:11.950
- I'll give you taxes![br]- Ow!

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.950
Give it to him! Give it to him![br]Give it to him, Friar!

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:26.780
You're under arrest[br]for high treason to the crown.

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:29.340
Oh, no.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.630
Oh, there, there, Mother.

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:37.580
Every town

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:42.590
Has its ups and downs

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:47.350
Sometimes ups

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:52.900
Outnumber the downs

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:57.810
But not in Nottingham

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:28.620
S-sire, if I may...

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.350
may venture an opinion...

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:33.680
you're not your usual cheerful,[br]genial self today.

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:41.310
L-l-I know. I know.

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:44.990
You haven't counted[br]your money for days. Hmm?

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.650
It always makes you so happy.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.190
Sire, taxes are pouring in.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.530
The jail is full.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.070
And... Oh!

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:01.670
I have good news, sire.[br]Friar Tuck is in jail.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.990
Friar Tuck?

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:07.590
It's Robin Hood I want,[br]you idiot!

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:11.840
Oh! I'd give all my gold[br]if I could just get my hands...

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.340
Uh...

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.300
Did you say "Friar Tuck"?

01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:20.560
Did I? Oh. Y-Y-Yes, I did.

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.210
Ah, Hiss! I have it.

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:30.480
I'll use that fat friar[br]as bait to trap Robin Hood.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:34.070
- Another trap?[br]- Yes, yes, you stupid serpent.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:39.230
Friar Tuck will be led to the gallows[br]in the village square, don't you see?

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.560
B-B-B-But, sire, hang Friar Tuck?[br]A man of the church?

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.580
Yes, my reluctant reptile.

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:51.330
And when our elusive hero[br]tries to rescue...

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:54.920
the corpulent cleric...

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.490
my men will be ready.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.430
Well, Trigger, everything's[br]rigged up and all set.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.430
Yep. It's one of the prettiest[br]scaffolds you ever built, Sheriff.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:30.140
Oh, Sheriff, don't ya reckon we'd[br]oughta give that there trapdoor a test?

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:39.140
"Criminently." Now I know why[br]your mama called ya Nutsy.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.350
Alms. Alms for the poor.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:48.320
Do me old ears hear[br]the melodious voice of the sheriff?

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:50.960
That's right, old man.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:54.000
What be goin' on here?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.210
We're gonna hang Friar Tuck.

01:03:56.290 --> 01:04:00.380
No! Hang Fri...[br]Um, hang Friar Tuck?

01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.670
You betcha. At dawn.

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:06.010
And maybe it'll[br]even be a double hangin'.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.670
Shh! Shh![br]Dummy up, you dummy.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.630
A double hangin', eh?

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.640
Who be the other one[br]who gets the rope?

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:19.180
Sheriff, he's gettin'[br]too all-fired nosy.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.070
I didn't mean nothin'.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:28.100
But, um, couldn't there be trouble[br]if Robin Hood showed up?

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:32.030
Well, what do ya know, Sheriff?[br]He guessed it.

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:34.360
Nutsy, button your beak.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.360
Ah, no need to worry.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:40.920
The sheriff be too crafty,[br]too clever and too smart...

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.920
for the likes of him, says I.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.760
Ya hear that, Nutsy? For bein' blind, he[br]sure knows a good man when he sees one.

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.800
Heh... Says I.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:57.040
SHeriff, I still got a feelin' that[br]that snoopy, old codger knows too much.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.640
Oh, shut up, Trigger.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.390
He's just a harmless,[br]old, blind beggar.

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:07.140
Alms. Alms for the poor. Alms.

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:09.190
Alms for the poor.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:13.030
Rob. We can't let 'em[br]hang Friar Tuck.

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:16.140
Ajailbreak tonight[br]is the only chance he's got.

01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:19.490
Ajailbreak?[br]There ain't no way you can get...

01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:23.000
We've got to, Johnny,[br]or Friar Tuck dies at dawn.

01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.370
One o'clock...

01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:28.410
and all's well!

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:37.930
Nutsy, you better set your brains[br]ahead a couple of hours.

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:43.260
Yes, sir. Uh, does that there mean[br]addin' or subtractin'?

01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:44.930
Oh, let's forget it.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.650
Yes, sir, Sheriff, sir.

01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:53.610
Nutsy, how can I sleep with you[br]yellin' "All's well!" all the time here?

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.620
Sheriff, everything[br]ain't "all's well."

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.190
I got a feelin' in my bones...

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.830
there's gonna be a jailbreak[br]any minute.

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:01.400
"Criminently," Trigger!

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:03.900
Point that peashooter[br]the other way.

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:07.910
Don't you worry none, Sheriff.[br]The safety's on Old Betsy.

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.210
What in tarnation you tryin' to do,[br]you birdbrain?

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.040
Just doin' my duty, Sheriff.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:21.630
Oh, you and that itchy[br]trigger finger of yours.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.520
- Hey, did you hear that?[br]- Sure did, Trigger.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:34.140
There's somethin' funny[br]goin' on around here.

01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:37.480
Come on. You cover me.

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:45.870
Wait a minute.[br]Uh, is the safety on Old Betsy?

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:47.230
You bet it is, Sheriff.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.190
That's what I'm afraid of.[br]You go first.

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.870
All right, you in there!

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.420
Come out with your hands up!

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.130
Yeah. Reach for the sky!

01:07:59.210 --> 01:08:02.830
Just you watch[br]this "preformance," partner.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.120
Be careful, Rob.

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:11.420
Jehoshaphat, Trigger![br]Put that peashooter down.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.050
Oh, shucks, Trigger.[br]It's only Nutsy.

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.390
And "criminently,"[br]get back to your patrol.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:19.880
On the double. Git!

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:21.970
I'm a-gittin'. I'm a-gittin'.

01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:25.560
That Trigger.[br]He's gittin' everybody edgy.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.200
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:31.990
That fat friar is gonna dangle[br]from the gallows come daybreak.

01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:35.109
Fine.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.609
Why don't ya just sit yourself[br]down here kinda cozy-like?

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.080
Well, thank ya, Nutsy.

01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:46.029
Just close your sleepy little eyeballs.

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:48.529
The sandman's a-comin'.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.920
Why don't you, uh,[br]let me loosen that belt?

01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.680
Rockabye, Sheriff[br]Just you relax

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.340
I'm relaxing.

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:24.899
Ooh. Oh, Nutsy,[br]that's mighty sweet.

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:26.779
Sing it one more time, will ya?

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:33.040
Rockabye, Sheriff[br]Just you relax

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.859
I'm relaxing.

01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:47.800
Wait a minute![br]Jailbreak! Jailbreak!

01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:51.300
I heard it! I heard it, Sheriff.[br]The door! The door!

01:09:53.050 --> 01:09:57.960
Now, for the last time,[br]no more false alarms.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.470
Now, you release Friar Tuck[br]and the others...

01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:03.270
and I'll drop in[br]on the royal treasury.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.650
Oh. Little John! It can't be!

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:19.610
Shh. Quiet.[br]We're bustin' outta here.

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.110
Thank God.

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:24.120
My prayers have been answered.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.480
I'm ready.[br]Where's the bad guys?

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.300
Take it easy, son.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.310
Robin Hood?[br]I'll get even. I'll get...

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.340
It's Robin Hood l-I want.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:16.220
Praise the Lord,[br]and pass the tax rebate!

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.570
Come on. Follow me.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.710
Sheriff, now... now...[br]now don't get your dander up...

01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:44.030
but I still got[br]a feelin' that...

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:48.740
Friar. Get goin'. Hurry.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:55.970
Guards! Guards! My gold!

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.820
Oh, no, no, no![br]They're getting away with my gold!

01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:12.200
Guards! Guards!

01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:14.530
To the jail!

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:17.400
Rhinos, halt! Stop! Desist!

01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:25.170
Everybody, this way!

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:04.690
That's all of them.[br]Get going!

01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:12.750
This ain't no hayride.[br]Let's move it outta here. Ho!

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.840
On to Sherwood Forest!

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.830
Stop! My baby!

01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:21.500
Mama! Mama! Wait for me!

01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:37.510
We got him now.

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:39.400
Keep going.[br]Don't worry about me.

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:19.520
This time we got him for sure.

01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:56.620
Shoot him!

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:11.760
Kill him! Kill him!

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:26.110
Come on, Rob. Come on.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.780
He's just gotta make it.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.460
No. No, no.

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:41.740
Hiss! He's finished![br]Done for!

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.470
La, la, la

01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:51.460
He's gonna make it,[br]isn't he, Little John?

01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:11.560
Hey, what's that?

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:17.160
Little John, lookit, lookit.

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:22.160
Hey, what the...

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:26.500
Oh, man, did you[br]have me worried, Rob.

01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:28.570
I thought you were long gone.

01:19:28.670 --> 01:19:31.630
Ah, not Robin Hood.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:36.760
He could've swum twice that far,[br]huh, Mr Robin Hood, sir?

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:41.420
Look, sire. Look. He's made it.[br]He got away again.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:46.260
A pox on the phoney King of England![br]Oo-de-lally!

01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.100
- Oo-de-lally![br]- Oh, no. It's so miserably unfair.

01:19:51.190 --> 01:19:54.780
Well, I tried to tell you,[br]but no, no, no, you wouldn't listen.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.770
Your traps just never work.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:59.570
And now look what you've done[br]to your mother's castle.

01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:03.610
Mommy!

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:09.700
- Hold still, you cowardly cobra![br]- Sire, no!

01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:12.030
Please! Oh! No!

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.040
Procrastinating python.

01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:20.920
Aggravating asp!

01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:24.960
- You eel in snake's clothing.[br]- Help!

01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:30.430
He's gone stark raving mad!

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:49.010
You know, I thought we'd never[br]get rid of those two rascals.

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:51.890
But lucky for us folks,[br]King Richard returned...

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:55.100
and, well, he-he just[br]straightened everything out.

01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:12.280
Say, we better get over to the church.[br]Sounds like somebody's gettin' hitched.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:18.670
Long live Robin Hood!

01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:28.500
Long live King Richard!

01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:30.220
Oh, Friar Tuck.

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:34.720
It appears that I now have[br]an outlaw for an in-law.

01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.970
It's not bad.

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:46.850
Gee, Skippy,[br]how come you're goin'?

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:49.570
Well, Robin Hood's[br]gonna have kids...

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:52.490
so somebody's gotta[br]keep their eye on things.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.150
Ho!

01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:03.320
Oh! I've never been so happy.

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:23.640
Hey, here come the bride, Trigger.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:26.650
"Persent" arms!

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.150
Well, folks, that's the way[br]it really happened.

01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:46.610
Love goes on and on

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:49.980
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

01:22:50.090 --> 01:22:51.660
Oo- de-lally, oo-de-lally[br]Golly, what a day

01:22:52.305 --> 01:22:58.325
