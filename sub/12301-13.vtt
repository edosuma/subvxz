WEBVTT

01:50.636 --> 01:51.862
911.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.369
Busy night.

02:03.611 --> 02:05.687
As always.

02:05.873 --> 02:07.056
What do we have here?

02:07.056 --> 02:08.268
Not pretty.

02:08.268 --> 02:10.668
The victim's name is
Juan marco varon.

02:10.668 --> 02:12.306
He owns this place.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.192
Still waiting for the M.E.
to get here, but, uh,

02:14.192 --> 02:16.321
it's pretty obvious
that he's been tortured,

02:16.321 --> 02:18.436
beaten, had his throat slashed.

02:18.436 --> 02:20.763
I think the murder weapon is a chaveta.

02:22.086 --> 02:24.775
Yes. Used for cutting cigars.

02:24.775 --> 02:26.140
It's a hell of a way to go.

02:26.140 --> 02:27.736
He called 911.

02:27.736 --> 02:30.981
Stayed on long enough for location
tracking to peg him down.

02:30.981 --> 02:33.584
In other words, our victim

02:33.584 --> 02:35.301
called in his own murder.

03:10.676 --> 03:13.718
MIAMI
2x13 Blood Moon

03:28.856 --> 03:31.619
Third-degree burn
lesions on his back.

03:31.619 --> 03:33.387
Just like this electric branding iron.

03:33.587 --> 03:36.762
I bet he uses them to
logo his cigar boxes.

03:41.437 --> 03:44.028
What did you do to
deserve this, mi hijo?

03:44.028 --> 03:45.177
You know what, Alexx?

03:45.177 --> 03:46.514
Someone...

03:46.514 --> 03:48.175
is making a statement.

03:48.175 --> 03:49.981
So we're not dealing with a random.

03:49.981 --> 03:52.116
No, it's somebody that he knows.

03:52.116 --> 03:56.636
I'm going to have Yelina canvas the
neighborhood to see if he has enemies.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.047
Got some vegetation here.

04:01.084 --> 04:03.503
It's too green to be tobacco.

04:03.636 --> 04:06.158
Okay, well bag it and tag it
and let me know, all right?

04:06.484 --> 04:08.306
Alexx. Thank you.

04:32.348 --> 04:33.705
Talk about torture.

04:34.449 --> 04:35.867
What?

04:37.999 --> 04:39.634
It's not a cigar.

04:43.151 --> 04:45.844
Non-serrated edge. Clean.

04:45.974 --> 04:48.905
Looks like he was cut with
the same blade as his throat.

04:48.905 --> 04:50.903
Think it was before or after?

04:51.206 --> 04:54.547
Well, judging from the amount
of blood in his genital area,

04:54.547 --> 04:58.098
he had several minutes to suffer
before his throat was cut.

04:58.746 --> 05:00.162
Another one?

05:01.344 --> 05:04.062
This is my third body
in as many hours.

05:04.176 --> 05:05.830
Going to be a long night.

05:17.549 --> 05:19.547
Matt bolton. 25 years old.

05:19.547 --> 05:22.213
19 donna road, miami beach.

05:22.213 --> 05:24.777
Came here to make
a cash withdrawal.

05:25.578 --> 05:27.701
Every warm body we
have is out tonight,

05:27.701 --> 05:29.955
and we're still outnumbered
by the cold ones.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.078
GSW to the chest.

05:35.078 --> 05:37.655
Point of entry, right of the sternum.

05:41.539 --> 05:43.845
Doesn't appear to be an exit wound.

05:46.077 --> 05:48.123
So there's a little evidence

05:48.123 --> 05:49.761
still left in him.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.227
Will you let me know
when you get the bullet?

05:51.227 --> 05:52.863
You got it.

05:55.770 --> 05:58.100
We've got an approximate time of death.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.827
11:18 pm.

06:08.147 --> 06:10.336
This key is bent.

06:10.486 --> 06:13.705
There's some trace on it. It could
have been used for self-defense.

06:29.233 --> 06:31.837
Hey, we're going to need to
get that bank manager out of bed.

06:31.837 --> 06:34.400
All right. / Take a look
at that surveillance tape.

06:38.786 --> 06:41.733
Juan marco varon's phone records.

06:42.208 --> 06:45.483
- That's the 911 call.
- That's 911,

06:45.622 --> 06:47.373
Take a look at this.

06:47.373 --> 06:50.529
20 minutes earlier,
he received a call.

06:50.529 --> 06:52.273
But from who?

06:52.273 --> 06:54.606
I don't know. I'll run
a reverse directory.

06:57.614 --> 06:58.880
Cell phone.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.257
Free cuba organization.
I know them. They're, uh...

07:02.257 --> 07:04.861
an activist group
for the cuban balseros.

07:04.861 --> 07:05.889
Yes, the rafters, you see,

07:05.889 --> 07:10.115
but this phone record doesn't say who
the individual was that made the call, right?

07:10.115 --> 07:12.377
- No. It doesn't.
- Wait a second.

07:12.377 --> 07:16.303
If it's a newer cell phone,
it may have a GPS locator.

07:16.391 --> 07:18.264
That's a good idea.

07:18.741 --> 07:23.717
If the cell phone is still on and the satellites
have a clear line of sight, we're in business.

07:23.717 --> 07:26.208
Clear line of sight.

07:33.779 --> 07:35.945
- Hello?
- Ms. Coto?

07:35.945 --> 07:38.170
Marisela gonzalez coto.
Who am I talking to?

07:38.170 --> 07:40.386
My name is Horatio caine, ma'am.

07:40.980 --> 07:43.557
What we're doing here
is perfectly legal.

07:43.557 --> 07:45.249
It's legal as long
as you stay on land.

07:45.249 --> 07:48.032
If you choose to enter
the water to assist,

07:48.032 --> 07:50.202
you'll be in violation of the law.

07:50.202 --> 07:52.630
I know the law, Mr. Caine.

07:52.728 --> 07:57.999
The organization cuba libre brings blankets
and coffee to the balseros every full moon.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.979
We try to help them into safety.

08:00.979 --> 08:03.755
More rafters come when there's
extra light from the full moon.

08:03.755 --> 08:06.796
Yeah, they think it's safer,
but, actually, it's more dangerous.

08:06.796 --> 08:09.104
The coast guard can see them better.

08:09.104 --> 08:11.663
Yeah. The coast guard, uh,
has to send them back.

08:11.663 --> 08:13.625
They make it to dry land,
they can stay.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.883
It's called wet foot, dry foot.

08:16.623 --> 08:18.036
Ms. Coto,

08:18.036 --> 08:22.931
Earlier this evening, this man
received a call from your cell phone.

08:23.443 --> 08:26.520
I don't know who he is,
why would I call him?

08:26.520 --> 08:30.909
That's a very good question,
because shortly after him taking the call,

08:30.909 --> 08:33.113
he was murdered.

08:33.715 --> 08:35.190
I didn't call him.

08:35.190 --> 08:37.736
You ever let the balseros
use your cell phone?

08:37.736 --> 08:39.039
Yes, all the time.

08:39.039 --> 08:42.633
So they can call their relatives
and let them know they're safe.

08:43.280 --> 08:44.800
What I need is

08:44.800 --> 08:46.674
your cell phone

08:46.674 --> 08:49.846
so I can run some
fingerprint tests on it.

08:49.949 --> 08:51.404
Okay.

08:51.756 --> 08:54.083
Just call my office when
I can have it back.

08:54.083 --> 08:56.107
Okay. Fair enough.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.528
Hey, Marisela!

09:02.766 --> 09:04.313
Two swimmers!

09:07.298 --> 09:10.489
H, they don't look too good.
I don't think they're going to make it.

09:11.198 --> 09:13.753
I would agree. You want to
take the guy, I'll take the little girl?

09:15.103 --> 09:16.513
Officer.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.038
Excuse me, Excuse me!

09:19.166 --> 09:20.657
Hang on!

09:54.933 --> 09:58.233
Your feet are wet, senor Caine.

09:59.982 --> 10:02.337
You're violating the law.

10:02.337 --> 10:04.418
Let's hope I'm alone.

11:01.159 --> 11:04.121
Phone was covered in prints,
a lot of partials.

11:04.121 --> 11:07.895
The completes all belong to
Marisela coto except for one.

11:07.895 --> 11:09.786
that I isolated on the mouthpiece.

11:09.786 --> 11:13.995
Now, I figure that the killer probably
covered the mouthpiece when calling.

11:14.213 --> 11:15.628
Juan marco cigars.

11:15.628 --> 11:17.621
Who? Hello?

11:17.761 --> 11:19.631
I'm running it through AFIS now.

11:21.284 --> 11:25.191
For kicks, let's just try the
I.C.E. database. Let's try that.

11:25.191 --> 11:27.462
Homeland security?
Yeah. / All right.

11:32.768 --> 11:34.448
Bull's-eye.

11:34.796 --> 11:37.013
His name is Carlos gonzalez.

11:37.013 --> 11:39.623
Carlos gonzalez. All right,
let's pick him up.

11:39.623 --> 11:42.007
- We can't. He's in custody.
- Wait a second. Why?

11:42.007 --> 11:45.736
Immigrations and customs
enforcement picked him up last night.

11:45.736 --> 11:47.865
They picked him up last night?

11:47.980 --> 11:50.232
The murder happened last night.

11:56.214 --> 11:57.627
Carlos.

11:59.435 --> 12:01.378
Carlos, do you know
why you're here?

12:01.509 --> 12:02.347
No.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.776
A man was murdered last night,

12:04.776 --> 12:06.616
and we think you had
something to do with it.

12:06.616 --> 12:09.820
Here's how. Our victim,
Juan marco varon,

12:09.820 --> 12:11.648
was called on a cell phone,

12:11.648 --> 12:14.913
and we found your fingerprint
on that cell phone.

12:15.021 --> 12:17.041
The, the lady's phone
from cuba libre?

12:17.041 --> 12:18.420
That's correct.

12:18.420 --> 12:19.894
No, boys.

12:19.894 --> 12:23.475
I just used it when I got here
to, to call a name from the help list.

12:23.475 --> 12:26.060
Where were you
last night about 10:00?

12:26.149 --> 12:27.708
I was in the ocean,

12:27.708 --> 12:29.626
trying not to drown.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.947
Yeah, our agents picked him up coming
out of the water around midnight.

12:33.947 --> 12:35.464
Alright / Let's go.

12:36.344 --> 12:38.740
I didn't call this man you said.

12:38.856 --> 12:41.170
I didn't even know him.

12:41.330 --> 12:44.635
- I don't know anybody here.
- Now you know me.

12:44.754 --> 12:46.297
and that's a start.

12:54.390 --> 12:57.210
Oh, good, is that the
ATM security video?

12:57.210 --> 12:59.101
Yeah, I just pulled it up.

12:59.101 --> 13:02.449
Matt bolton comes in right about here.

13:08.838 --> 13:11.047
Watch this.

13:11.195 --> 13:12.713
He glances back.

13:12.713 --> 13:14.621
Someone called out to him maybe?

13:14.621 --> 13:16.404
Can you back it up?

13:23.991 --> 13:25.546
Right there.

13:25.837 --> 13:27.678
The approaching headlights.

13:27.678 --> 13:30.119
Could be the shooter's car
idling just out of view.

13:30.119 --> 13:32.766
Not completely.
We got a license plate.

13:36.051 --> 13:38.156
I need to adjust the angle.

13:39.689 --> 13:42.796
7183.

13:42.796 --> 13:44.889
I can't read the rest.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.776
What about the front bumper
at the edge of frame?

13:48.464 --> 13:50.491
I'll run the specs.

13:54.838 --> 13:58.895
BMW 740 series, 2000 to 2003.

13:58.895 --> 14:02.149
We'll cross-check it with the
division of auto records.

14:02.149 --> 14:05.415
BMW 740, 2000 to 2003,

14:05.415 --> 14:10.325
retaining the license
plate numbers 7183.

14:15.482 --> 14:17.947
Melanie hines. 25.

14:18.022 --> 14:21.568
There's a cross-reference to FJD.
Will you click on it?

14:23.481 --> 14:25.133
Her car was reported stolen.

14:25.133 --> 14:28.521
Yeah, but look at the time.
12:20 A.M.

14:28.630 --> 14:31.824
That's an hour after it was parked
outside Matt bolton's murder.

14:31.824 --> 14:35.227
I guess we need to ask Melanie
hines some timeline questions.

14:39.010 --> 14:42.059
We're investigating the
shooting death of Matt bolton

14:42.059 --> 14:46.512
outside a dade mutual
ATM last night. You know?

14:46.512 --> 14:47.404
No.

14:47.404 --> 14:50.919
There's an ATM surveillance video
that places your BMW at the scene.

14:50.919 --> 14:53.126
My car was involved
in a murder? / Yeah,

14:53.126 --> 14:56.384
and based on the time
that your car was stolen,

14:56.384 --> 14:58.433
so were you.

15:00.368 --> 15:03.479
I went to a movie on the beach.

15:06.779 --> 15:10.575
Got back to the parking lot a couple
hours later, my car was missing.

15:10.575 --> 15:13.422
- I don't know what time it was taken.
- Do you own a gun, ms. Hines?

15:13.422 --> 15:15.654
- You think I was involved in this?
- Well, were you?

15:15.654 --> 15:17.284
No!

15:17.781 --> 15:19.963
I wouldn't even know
how to handle a gun.

15:19.963 --> 15:21.716
We're going to ask you to
stick around for a little while,

15:21.716 --> 15:24.353
so make yourself
comfortable, and, uh...

15:25.413 --> 15:27.379
you want another
soda or something?

15:29.584 --> 15:30.779
Want me to take that for you?

15:30.779 --> 15:32.482
Whatever.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.728
Hey, did you forget to
send me that bullet?

15:47.728 --> 15:49.062
What bullet?

15:49.062 --> 15:50.850
Can't find it.

15:50.966 --> 15:53.670
There's an entrance wound
without exit. There has to be a bullet.

15:53.670 --> 15:57.301
So far, the wound tract and
surrounding tissue's telling me otherwise.

15:57.301 --> 15:59.066
Are you thinking ricochet? / No.

15:59.066 --> 16:03.510
It split the fourth and fifth rib,
punctured the ascending aorta.

16:05.019 --> 16:08.217
- No fragments.
- Okay, where is it?

16:08.217 --> 16:09.843
I don't know,

16:09.843 --> 16:12.319
But I got a good way to find out.

16:27.382 --> 16:30.995
Oh, my lord. Is that my bullet?

16:31.116 --> 16:33.485
Your bullet in his ankle.

16:33.485 --> 16:37.696
Came to the end of the line in
the dorsal artery near the talus.

16:37.696 --> 16:40.194
This is my first bullet embolism.

16:40.428 --> 16:44.815
Okay, so the.22-caliber
round entered the aorta.

16:46.205 --> 16:49.709
Blood flow carried the bullet
to the bifurcation,

16:49.709 --> 16:52.495
then down the femoral artery.

16:52.808 --> 16:54.842
It's a fantastic voyage.

16:54.842 --> 16:56.994
The ride of his life.

16:56.994 --> 17:00.270
I'll dig that out so you can
find out whose gun it came from.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.673
I've already got a candidate on ice.

17:12.934 --> 17:14.598
Hey, what's up?

17:14.825 --> 17:17.510
Hey. So, how's Melanie hines?

17:18.069 --> 17:21.031
Well, I could tell you that
she drinks a lot of soda.

17:21.232 --> 17:23.895
The.22-caliber bullet
we found in Matt bolton,

17:23.895 --> 17:25.938
it has a left-hand twist.

17:27.731 --> 17:29.137
That's unusual, isn't it?

17:29.137 --> 17:30.817
Yeah. The norm is right hand.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.452
Basically, the only kind of handgun that
has this kind of striation in a winfield.

17:34.452 --> 17:37.034
It's a designer gun. It's
lightweight. It's compact.

17:37.034 --> 17:39.333
It's... it's a chick's gun.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.732
So that's the kind of firearm
she could just stick in her purse?

17:44.017 --> 17:45.971
Well, we can't ask her,
'cause she just left.

17:45.971 --> 17:47.458
She left?

17:47.917 --> 17:49.617
She said unless we arrest her,

17:49.617 --> 17:51.179
she'll be at home.

17:51.887 --> 17:54.282
What a cool customer.

17:59.332 --> 18:00.694
Eric, here's what I want to do.

18:00.694 --> 18:03.736
I want to run our victim
through N.C.I.A.

18:03.736 --> 18:05.194
Our victim?

18:08.069 --> 18:11.409
Our suspects are too benign.
We need to go back to him.

18:12.101 --> 18:13.590
Okay.

18:15.292 --> 18:17.073
Here he is. Okay, we got a match.

18:17.073 --> 18:19.580
Both name and
social security number.

18:19.580 --> 18:22.020
I've got a Juan marco varon.

18:22.020 --> 18:25.259
Came over during the mariel
boat lift 21 years ago.

18:25.259 --> 18:27.374
He's a marielito.

18:29.054 --> 18:32.480
There's only one problem, H.
Take a look at that.

18:32.602 --> 18:35.697
That's not our victim.

18:36.797 --> 18:39.492
Varon died in 1991,

18:39.492 --> 18:41.762
and then again last night?

18:41.762 --> 18:45.522
Our victim assumed the
late Mr. Varon's identity.

18:47.864 --> 18:49.650
The question becomes

18:49.650 --> 18:52.564
if he's not Varon, who is our victim,

18:52.564 --> 18:56.057
and who wants him dead?

19:06.917 --> 19:08.945
His name is Miguel bernardo.

19:09.058 --> 19:10.819
a. k.a. El carnicero.

19:10.819 --> 19:12.478
the butcher.

19:12.632 --> 19:14.610
He was one of castro's verdugo.

19:14.610 --> 19:16.836
Executioner. / Torturer.

19:16.836 --> 19:18.620
My, uh, my mother used
to talk about him.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.555
He did a lot of damage
to people that she knew.

19:20.555 --> 19:23.193
He used to brand Xs
across his prisoners' backs.

19:23.193 --> 19:25.657
Okay, well, that could
explain the brand on his back.

19:25.657 --> 19:27.864
Yeah, well, what I don't get
is he's in the system.

19:27.864 --> 19:29.301
Why isn't he behind bars?

19:29.301 --> 19:31.470
That's a very good question, Eric.

19:31.470 --> 19:35.648
I'm sure there are a few hundred suspects that
would be very happy to have killed this animal.

19:35.648 --> 19:37.163
Eric, are you going to
be okay with this?

19:37.163 --> 19:38.646
Yeah, I'm going to be fine, H.

19:38.646 --> 19:40.128
Look, maybe...

19:40.128 --> 19:41.791
maybe Carlos gonzalez
was one of his victims.

19:41.791 --> 19:46.460
No. Carlos is too young. Bernardo
came over 15 years ago, didn't he?

19:46.460 --> 19:50.923
So we... we are looking
for somebody older.

19:59.435 --> 20:01.161
Ms. Coto?

20:03.933 --> 20:07.784
I'm, uh, I'm extremely busy right now,
so what can I do for you?

20:07.784 --> 20:09.259
This won't take very much time.

20:09.259 --> 20:13.463
Does the name Miguel
bernardo ring a bell?

20:13.586 --> 20:15.084
Who?

20:15.084 --> 20:17.272
El carnicero.

20:17.422 --> 20:18.838
Why?

20:18.838 --> 20:22.158
Because he was murdered two
nights ago in his shop.

20:24.383 --> 20:26.508
Were you one of his victims, ma'am?

20:26.610 --> 20:28.075
No.

20:28.755 --> 20:33.300
Ms. Coto, I have a female officer outside
who's prepared to examine you.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.024
- Well, should I be talking to my lawyer?- I can get a warrant

20:36.024 --> 20:38.313
if you'd be more comfortable.

20:38.867 --> 20:40.751
Don't bother.

20:52.633 --> 20:54.875
Satisfied?

20:59.753 --> 21:01.644
Would you like to talk about that?

21:01.644 --> 21:03.813
Let's just say Miguel bernardo

21:03.813 --> 21:07.186
did a lot more than mark me.

21:07.398 --> 21:09.361
I'm sorry.

21:11.255 --> 21:15.638
What he got didn't come even
close to what he deserved.

21:17.155 --> 21:20.280
So, are you going to arrest me now?

21:21.045 --> 21:23.660
I'm thinking about it.

21:24.519 --> 21:26.601
We'll be in touch.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.374
Let's keep an eye on her, all right?

21:36.374 --> 21:37.973
All right.

21:44.034 --> 21:45.075
Hi.

21:45.075 --> 21:48.924
Melanie hines's answering machine says
she's going on vacation this weekend.

21:48.924 --> 21:51.133
Please, tell me you have something.

21:51.133 --> 21:54.778
Trace from Matt bolton's shoes.

21:55.873 --> 22:01.107
Sand and some sort of brown fiber.

22:01.353 --> 22:03.417
Yeah, it's got a golden sheen to it.

22:03.417 --> 22:06.151
Could be jute fiber.
It's woven into burlap.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.993
What if Matt bolton was at the
pier beach silver screen?

22:08.993 --> 22:11.769
It was the same movie
that Melanie hines went to.

22:11.769 --> 22:13.888
I saw young frankenstein
there last summer,

22:13.888 --> 22:18.232
and they laid a burlap tarp down so
the chairs wouldn't sink into the sand.

22:39.802 --> 22:40.978
Burlap.

22:40.978 --> 22:42.260
Edges are frayed.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.121
Lot of foot traffic.

22:53.241 --> 22:55.030
Mr. Pine. Calleigh duquesne.

22:55.030 --> 22:56.747
We spoke on the phone.

22:56.899 --> 22:58.574
So...

23:00.634 --> 23:01.910
That's him.

23:01.910 --> 23:05.928
It says in the activity report that you filed
that you ordered him off the property.

23:05.928 --> 23:08.472
Yeah. Him and a girl
he was arguing with.

23:08.609 --> 23:10.524
- Please, can you take him away?
- No, you, too, miss.

23:10.524 --> 23:12.536
What are you talking about?
I wasn't doing anything.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.744
Is this her by any chance?

23:15.618 --> 23:17.664
That's her.
You're two for two.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.103
So, what was the problem?
Do you know?

23:20.208 --> 23:22.131
Caught the tail end of their fight.

23:23.106 --> 23:26.141
- Yeah.
- But this is the girl you remember?

23:26.141 --> 23:28.237
Yeah. Red hair.

23:29.253 --> 23:32.753
Miami dade's finest just
found Melanie hines's BMW

23:32.753 --> 23:34.941
in an abandoned lot off of dayton.

23:34.941 --> 23:37.068
Well, it looks like we're
going on a road trip.

23:37.068 --> 23:40.167
- John, thank you for your time.
- Pleasure.

23:48.857 --> 23:51.855
Owner wanted it off his lot.
City was going to tow it.

23:51.855 --> 23:53.532
Should we tow it?

23:53.658 --> 23:55.053
You seen our garage?

23:55.053 --> 23:57.526
Graveyard shift's got three layovers.

23:57.526 --> 23:59.538
We got to start it here.

24:04.890 --> 24:07.086
This should be a mandatory sentence.

24:07.328 --> 24:11.005
- What have you got?
- Nasty gash, side panel.

24:11.005 --> 24:13.433
Somebody was pissed off.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.499
There's no rust.

24:25.499 --> 24:27.015
Looks like it's fresh.

24:27.015 --> 24:29.456
Matt bolton's key had
black flecks in it.

24:29.456 --> 24:31.716
Yeah, I'll run a comparison.

25:01.294 --> 25:03.217
The car's not stripped.

25:03.277 --> 25:06.574
- Nothing's missing.
- Except the driver's side window.

25:06.574 --> 25:09.302
There's hardly any glass inside.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.554
Looks like it's busted out.

25:14.684 --> 25:18.324
Telling us, paradoxically,
it's an inside job.

25:23.930 --> 25:25.528
We found your car, miss Hines.

25:25.528 --> 25:27.449
We have reason to believe
it wasn't stolen.

25:27.449 --> 25:28.822
What do you mean?

25:30.351 --> 25:32.527
Your steering column,

25:32.527 --> 25:34.047
intact.

25:34.047 --> 25:35.873
Means it wasn't hot-wired.

25:35.980 --> 25:38.191
I don't even know
what hot-wired means.

25:38.191 --> 25:39.695
All right.

25:39.916 --> 25:42.972
Your window was busted
from the inside out.

25:42.972 --> 25:44.873
Do you know what that means?

25:45.301 --> 25:48.019
It means you staged
your own car theft.

25:48.330 --> 25:49.821
Why would I do that?

25:49.821 --> 25:51.116
I don't know.

25:51.116 --> 25:52.719
Why don't you tell us?

25:52.923 --> 25:56.368
Does it have anything to do with the fact
that you and Matt bolton were forcibly removed

25:56.368 --> 25:59.567
from the pier beach silver
screening two nights ago?

26:03.714 --> 26:05.778
We were talking.

26:05.778 --> 26:07.892
It started out innocent enough.

26:08.950 --> 26:11.276
- Do you mind if I sit here?
- No, go ahead.

26:11.441 --> 26:14.352
Smile. You're not the only one
that came to the movies alone tonight.

26:15.629 --> 26:18.077
If you're hitting on me,
that's pretty pathetic.

26:18.077 --> 26:20.341
- Let's start over. I'm Matt.
- I'm not interested.

26:20.341 --> 26:23.718
What a prize.
I just divorced a bitch like you.

26:23.835 --> 26:25.633
Bitch like me?

26:25.782 --> 26:28.035
Screw you. / Oh, my god.

26:28.035 --> 26:29.472
- What is your problem?
- What is wrong with you?

26:29.472 --> 26:31.629
- What is wrong with you?
- Please can you take him away?

26:31.629 --> 26:33.027
- No, you, too, miss.
- What are you talking about?

26:33.027 --> 26:34.449
I wasn't doing anything.

26:34.449 --> 26:36.898
He insulted you,
and then, for no reason,

26:36.898 --> 26:38.716
keyed your car in the parking lot?

26:38.716 --> 26:40.399
I might have...

26:40.908 --> 26:42.386
provoked him.

26:42.386 --> 26:44.139
Define provoke.

26:45.287 --> 26:47.217
Thanks for screwing up
my evening, courtney love.

26:47.217 --> 26:49.488
- Appreciate it.
- You probably got off on it.

26:49.488 --> 26:51.712
Go pop another viagra.

26:54.632 --> 26:57.442
I spent a ton on that car.

26:57.442 --> 27:00.682
I followed him to the ATM,
gave him a piece of my mind.

27:00.682 --> 27:02.895
But that is all I did.

27:02.895 --> 27:05.047
I didn't kill him.

27:05.852 --> 27:07.664
I'll be outside.

27:07.864 --> 27:09.225
Excuse us.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.989
I, uh, I'm sorry.
I don't like her.

27:15.989 --> 27:18.179
What does that have
to do with anything?

27:18.307 --> 27:19.764
Nothing.

27:19.764 --> 27:20.980
All right.

27:20.980 --> 27:24.111
Well, let's go see if we can
dig anything up on her.

27:25.038 --> 27:27.095
Miss hines, stay put.
We'll be back.

27:27.095 --> 27:28.654
Could I get another soda?

27:28.654 --> 27:30.456
We're fresh out.

27:30.673 --> 27:33.095
We do so have soda.
You just lied.

27:33.095 --> 27:35.120
Well, she's been lying to us all day.

27:41.587 --> 27:43.104
H? / Yeah.

27:43.104 --> 27:45.375
Look, I did some dumpster-diving
behind Marisela's office,

27:45.375 --> 27:47.249
and look what turned up.

27:47.249 --> 27:50.080
Carlos gonzalez and Marisela coto.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.733
Planning his arrival by raft, no doubt.

27:52.733 --> 27:54.052
But look...

27:54.052 --> 27:55.432
how he address.

27:55.432 --> 27:57.275
Madre.

27:57.405 --> 28:00.007
Wait a second.
Marisela is...

28:00.007 --> 28:03.144
Carlos' mother,
and that changes things.

28:03.144 --> 28:06.480
Okay, find his clothes, Eric,
and process them immediately.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.049
Look, I'll call immigration.

28:39.406 --> 28:41.109
Look, I think we've got him, H.

28:41.109 --> 28:45.167
I had a look at Carlos's clothes,
and I found this sample on the right.

28:45.355 --> 28:47.538
Caulerpa brachypus.

28:47.538 --> 28:48.987
Seaweed? / Yeah.

28:48.987 --> 28:53.335
Very common on our coast.
In Carlos's cuff and at the murder scene.

28:53.335 --> 28:56.030
Found it at both places. Okay.

28:56.030 --> 28:59.655
So, the murder happened at
approximately 10:00 p. m., Right?

28:59.655 --> 29:02.439
And I.C.E. And Carlos claim

29:02.439 --> 29:05.564
that Carlos came ashore at midnight.

29:05.564 --> 29:07.479
Which would mean that
he went back in the water

29:07.479 --> 29:10.364
after the murder to establish his alibi.

29:12.950 --> 29:15.147
I want to report a balsero.

29:15.147 --> 29:16.737
He just arrived.

29:22.852 --> 29:24.872
The problem with the seaweed is,

29:24.872 --> 29:26.789
it'll be circumstantial.

29:26.789 --> 29:27.934
How so?

29:27.934 --> 29:30.707
The mother could claim that
she inadvertently transferred

29:30.707 --> 29:32.824
the seaweed to the
murder scene, that's how.

29:32.824 --> 29:34.182
We need more.

29:34.182 --> 29:37.142
Okay. Like what?
We've looked at, uh, everything.

29:37.142 --> 29:40.856
Killers that use knives
usually cut themselves, right?

29:40.856 --> 29:44.009
Yeah. DNA report came back
with victim's blood only.

29:44.009 --> 29:45.390
So we...

29:45.390 --> 29:47.173
we need to look further.

29:50.780 --> 29:53.268
The blood on the chaveta
is the victim's, correct?

29:53.268 --> 29:54.515
Yes, sir. / Okay.

29:54.515 --> 29:57.885
Have we taken multiple
samples or just a reference?

29:57.986 --> 30:00.675
Well, with all these cases on my desk,
I only do a reference sample

30:00.675 --> 30:05.198
unless told to do otherwise. / Okay,
this would fall into the heading of otherwise.

30:05.198 --> 30:08.619
Isolating another blood
sample in that volume.

30:08.619 --> 30:10.230
it could take a while.

30:10.230 --> 30:12.564
I understand.
So we better get to work.

30:23.620 --> 30:24.765
Hey. / Hey.

30:24.765 --> 30:26.019
I was just looking for you.

30:26.019 --> 30:27.526
Homicide came up big.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.010
.22 winfield.

30:29.010 --> 30:30.271
Where did they find it?

30:30.271 --> 30:32.594
In a recycling bin in lummus park.

30:32.594 --> 30:34.601
Near the outdoor movies.

30:34.601 --> 30:36.313
Chick's gun.

30:41.031 --> 30:43.093
There are no workable prints here.

30:43.093 --> 30:46.727
Valera couldn't find any epithelials.
We're 0 for two.

30:46.727 --> 30:48.533
What do you see?

30:48.533 --> 30:53.541
Well, some kind of substance trapped
in the groove of magazine here.

30:53.541 --> 30:55.462
Take a look at that.

30:58.729 --> 31:02.601
Well, it can't be a gun
cleaning oil. It's translucent.

31:02.966 --> 31:05.016
Let's find out.

31:26.625 --> 31:29.764
Methylparaben butylparaben.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.365
And mineral oil.

31:31.365 --> 31:34.014
What is that, some kind of lotion?

31:34.115 --> 31:35.897
Looks like skin moisturizer.

31:36.955 --> 31:38.344
Great. Well...

31:38.344 --> 31:43.816
that narrows it down to everyone in
the state of florida, plus the tourists.

31:45.730 --> 31:48.268
This is from our bronze goddess.

31:48.268 --> 31:51.086
You took that with prints in mind.

31:52.629 --> 31:55.232
That could be the next best thing.

31:55.232 --> 31:56.896
There's more skin lotion.

31:56.896 --> 31:59.982
Well, if the chemical makeup
matches the gun magazine...

31:59.982 --> 32:02.288
we can put the gun in her hand.

32:06.694 --> 32:09.263
We found your gun.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.689
I told you, I don't own a gun.

32:11.689 --> 32:16.021
Well, there's traces of skin lotion
on the magazine in the gun.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.426
That says it's yours.

32:17.426 --> 32:20.081
Melanie, did you shoot Matt bolton?

32:24.085 --> 32:28.151
I had it with me, just in case.

32:28.151 --> 32:30.856
When I approached him,
the gun was down.

32:30.856 --> 32:33.253
I didn't even threaten him with it.

32:39.218 --> 32:41.339
Hey. You keyed my car.

32:41.339 --> 32:44.018
You know, somebody ought
to teach you a lesson.

32:46.692 --> 32:48.742
It's a hair trigger.

32:48.742 --> 32:53.002
I... took a step back,
tripped over the curb or...

32:53.002 --> 32:56.035
something, and the gun just...

32:57.000 --> 32:59.002
went off.

32:59.138 --> 33:01.349
I wasn't even aiming at him.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.711
It was an accident, but I knew
how it was going to look.

33:08.711 --> 33:12.302
That's why I ditched my car,
reported it stolen.

33:12.927 --> 33:15.332
I never meant to hurt anyone.

33:15.332 --> 33:19.006
It's just not that easy to shoot
a gun by accident, miss Hines.

33:19.006 --> 33:21.352
Do you know what
a trigger pull test is?

33:21.593 --> 33:23.567
I can guess.

33:23.567 --> 33:27.680
It's what we're going to use to prove
that your firearm didn't have a hair trigger,

33:27.680 --> 33:32.132
and that killing Matt bolton
was not an accident.

34:46.411 --> 34:48.080
How's it going?

34:48.482 --> 34:51.141
The single-action trigger
pull for the winfield handgun

34:51.141 --> 34:53.532
is between five and seven
pounds per square inch.

34:53.532 --> 34:56.187
Competition trigger's about a three.
It's very touchy.

34:56.187 --> 34:57.477
So that's what this is?

34:57.477 --> 34:59.437
No, this one's a two.

34:59.437 --> 35:01.543
A sneeze would set it off.

35:01.660 --> 35:03.323
It supports Melanie's story.

35:03.323 --> 35:04.833
Come on, you don't
believe she tripped.

35:04.833 --> 35:06.041
No, I don't.

35:06.041 --> 35:09.474
All right, so we go in to the
prosecutor, we present our case.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.574
Our opinion's got to
count for something.

35:11.574 --> 35:13.293
Apparently, it doesn't.

35:13.293 --> 35:16.082
What are you talking about?
The prosecutor thinks it's a wobbler,

35:16.082 --> 35:18.632
and he doesn't want to file
charges against Melanie hines.

35:18.632 --> 35:19.937
Are you kidding?

35:19.937 --> 35:21.278
I just got off the phone with him,

35:21.278 --> 35:24.589
so I came back to retest the gun
in case I had miscalculated,

35:24.589 --> 35:26.162
which I haven't.

35:26.162 --> 35:27.935
So she's just going to walk?

35:27.935 --> 35:29.538
I'm afraid so.

35:29.538 --> 35:31.641
She walks.

35:56.070 --> 35:58.339
Strong performance.

35:58.827 --> 36:01.462
You know, you should've been in
that movie instead of watching it.

36:01.462 --> 36:03.460
Guess I had that coming.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.668
Lobby or garage?

36:07.760 --> 36:09.991
I'll catch the next one.

36:10.087 --> 36:11.799
Hope so.

36:14.743 --> 36:16.458
you know, just for the record,

36:16.458 --> 36:19.016
that guy, he was just
trying to talk to you.

36:19.016 --> 36:20.609
He was trying to find an opening.

36:20.609 --> 36:22.047
He insulted me.

36:22.047 --> 36:24.058
Maybe it was to get your attention.

36:25.069 --> 36:27.426
Next time, why don't
you try rejection

36:27.426 --> 36:29.972
because it's a lot less messy

36:29.972 --> 36:33.413
and, you know what,
guys are used to it.

36:34.644 --> 36:36.672
See you around.

36:42.512 --> 36:44.448
Lieutenant. / Yeah?

36:44.575 --> 36:47.220
Got additional samples
from the chaveta.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.908
- Was there more blood on it?
- Yes, sir.

36:50.074 --> 36:52.785
Actually, I found it
under the chaveta handle.

36:52.881 --> 36:54.641
Belonging to who?

36:54.641 --> 36:56.425
Carlos gonzalez. / Okay.

36:56.425 --> 36:59.085
And you're not going to
believe what else I found.

37:04.788 --> 37:07.298
I want to see your hands, Carlos.

37:10.811 --> 37:12.581
How'd you get those cuts?

37:12.581 --> 37:15.953
I, I cut them on some
coral coming ashore.

37:15.953 --> 37:18.171
Really, some coral?

37:18.307 --> 37:20.388
Here's what I think.

37:20.388 --> 37:25.368
I think you got those on the blade
that you used on Miguel bernardo.

37:25.546 --> 37:26.522
No.

37:26.522 --> 37:29.401
No, I told you that I didn't
even know him, who he is.

37:29.401 --> 37:31.504
Was your mother involved?

37:35.782 --> 37:37.104
Madre.

37:37.104 --> 37:39.354
El carnicero is still in miami.

37:39.354 --> 37:40.901
Oh, no.

37:42.648 --> 37:44.465
She tried to stop me.

37:46.746 --> 37:49.093
Did you say you'd
never forget his voice?

37:50.420 --> 37:53.335
No, Carlos,
Carlos, no.

37:54.546 --> 37:56.982
She thought that by

37:56.982 --> 37:59.582
burying the past
that she could make it go away.

37:59.582 --> 38:01.511
Maybe you should've listened to her.

38:01.511 --> 38:04.996
He tortured and murdered
hundreds of people.

38:04.996 --> 38:06.184
I gave him what he deserved.

38:06.184 --> 38:07.615
That's not for you to decide.

38:07.615 --> 38:10.255
- Well, I did decide it, didn't I?
- You did.

38:10.255 --> 38:12.028
I only wish...

38:12.028 --> 38:14.217
I wish that I could give him...

38:15.519 --> 38:18.070
a taste...

38:18.070 --> 38:20.218
of what he gave to my mother.

38:24.568 --> 38:26.999
Did my mother tell you
what he did to her?

38:31.833 --> 38:34.173
He raped her over and over.

38:34.173 --> 38:36.746
I wasn't going to let him
get away with that.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.279
Yeah, I killed him.

38:47.279 --> 38:49.150
I was glad to do it.

38:49.150 --> 38:51.109
Like father, like son.

38:53.878 --> 38:55.699
What?

38:56.821 --> 38:59.478
Carlos, we did some work at the lab.

38:59.478 --> 39:01.384
Why don't you take a look at this?

39:02.269 --> 39:06.379
Your mother was Miguel's
prisoner 21 years ago.

39:06.487 --> 39:08.754
How old are you?

39:12.029 --> 39:15.219
Twenty.

39:18.511 --> 39:23.696
This is your DNA match with Miguel.

39:24.943 --> 39:26.504
So what are you saying,

39:26.504 --> 39:29.537
- that he was my father?
- That's correct.

39:33.528 --> 39:35.199
I don't believe you.

39:35.199 --> 39:37.533
Well, that's up to you.

39:42.499 --> 39:44.947
Only his blood...

39:45.324 --> 39:47.829
could've done what I did.

39:50.073 --> 39:53.721
I would agree with you there.

40:22.273 --> 40:23.741
Carlos.

40:25.164 --> 40:26.857
Mi hijo.

40:29.269 --> 40:32.140
Why didn't you tell me?

40:36.205 --> 40:37.774
Miss Coto.

41:10.405 --> 41:13.713
I waited ten years
for him to come over.

41:15.661 --> 41:18.552
Now I've lost him again.

41:21.840 --> 41:23.948
I, I will give a full confession.

41:23.948 --> 41:26.191
I, I will...
I will plead guilty.

41:26.191 --> 41:29.872
- I'm sorry, but the evidence is in.
- Well, then, lose the evidence.

41:30.870 --> 41:33.138
Please. Please.
Just arrest me instead.

41:33.138 --> 41:34.928
Here's what I want you to do.

41:34.928 --> 41:37.473
This is the name of a defense
attorney who's a friend of mine.

41:37.473 --> 41:39.629
He owes me a favor, miss Coto.

41:39.629 --> 41:41.214
I want you to take this.

41:41.214 --> 41:43.263
He'll help you.

41:56.850 --> 41:59.965
Call him.

42:10.227 --> 42:12.596
Okay.
