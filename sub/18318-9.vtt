00:42.643 --> 00:45.679
Gloria, I brought you
a pumpernickel scone.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.549
Gloria, that's voodoo!

00:49.550 --> 00:52.419
I can't believe we just
made that announcement
to the whole world

00:52.420 --> 00:54.521
without asking me first!

00:54.522 --> 00:55.688
I apologized.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.657
Come on, Gloria, don't get
caught up in the past.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.526
Just so you know,
everyone out there

00:59.527 --> 01:01.261
can hear everything
you're saying.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.497
It will take years of
fundraising to even come close...

01:04.498 --> 01:06.032
I'm not talking about years.
I'm talking about now.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.367
Right now.

01:07.368 --> 01:10.970
You want to see now?
Now, I am cleaning my desk.

01:10.971 --> 01:14.207
Because we don't have enough
money for a janitorial staff!

01:14.208 --> 01:16.709
I'm trying
to save this orchestra.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.278
Our orchestra!

01:18.279 --> 01:21.214
And you just asked a roomful
of multimillionaires

01:21.215 --> 01:24.317
to give their money
to the wrong thing

01:24.318 --> 01:26.286
Gloria, no!
It's not the wrong thing!

01:26.287 --> 01:28.054
It's actually the same thing.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.157
It's the orchestra and
the youth orchestra,
they go together.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.159
Not according to the I.R.S.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.827
The I.R....
That just means "IRS".

01:35.929 --> 01:37.164
Okay, I'm talking
about children,

01:37.165 --> 01:39.065
I'm talking about
the future, Gloria.

01:39.066 --> 01:40.167
It's a fantastic idea!

01:40.168 --> 01:41.434
- Yeah.
- It's a beautiful idea.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.372
And it would ensure an
audience for the future!

01:45.373 --> 01:48.275
But you can't just whip up
a citywide not-for-profit

01:48.276 --> 01:49.942
out of thin air!

01:49.943 --> 01:52.779
By the way, you have
to forgive Maestro Pembridge.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.881
He's having a hard time.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.048
How do you know about that?

01:56.049 --> 01:58.252
Everybod knows.
Right?

01:59.187 --> 02:01.754
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.324
You know, there is one way that
we could get the seed money

02:04.325 --> 02:06.326
and do it pretty quickly.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.627
Yeah, well,
he's not gonna do it.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.630
No, wait, wait.
I'm very unpredictable.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.399
I might do it.
Tell me, tell me.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.601
Well, after the Venice concert,

02:14.602 --> 02:16.869
we have been flooded
with requests for you
to do an endorsement.

02:16.870 --> 02:20.740
You know, like portable
speakers, or a watch...

02:20.741 --> 02:24.377
but there is one
that's pretty big.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.213
Big? Like, big, big how?

02:26.214 --> 02:29.216
- Oh, he's not gonna do it.
- Tell me, I don't
discriminate.

02:29.217 --> 02:30.317
Just tell me, tell me.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.423
Ah!

02:36.424 --> 02:38.358
What'd I tell you?
He's not gonna do it.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.627
Okay, Gloria...

02:40.628 --> 02:44.130
Okay, we have the music,
there's kids in the city.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.398
Millions of them.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.834
What costs money?
Why do we need the money?

02:47.835 --> 02:49.369
Instruments cost money.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.772
- Chairs. Chairs cost money.
- Chairs cost money?

02:52.773 --> 02:56.543
Chairs don't cost money.
Chairs are just there.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.545
Okay, are you joking with me?
No, go on.

02:58.546 --> 03:01.514
Okay, okay, I feel
obligated to do something

03:01.515 --> 03:03.250
that I've never done in my life.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.017
And I'm gonna do it.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.253
I'm gonna get the money myself.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.654
Be my guest!

03:07.655 --> 03:08.921
In fact, go out on the street

03:08.922 --> 03:11.123
and just pull it off
the money tree!

03:11.124 --> 03:12.493
That's exactly what
I'm gonna do.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.928
Oh, Craigy G?

03:15.929 --> 03:18.130
- Yes, Maestro?
- About your, you know, the...

03:18.131 --> 03:19.899
Mm-hmm?

03:19.900 --> 03:22.670
I can't believe
you're a person, man.

03:27.475 --> 03:30.277
Hey, everyone. Hi.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.379
Hi, Esther.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.281
Um, thank you all
so much for being here.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.015
I am so excited.

03:36.016 --> 03:37.016
Oh, are you kidding?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.285
A chance to play the premiere

03:38.286 --> 03:39.819
of Thomas Pembridge's
first composition?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.455
I've actually had a poster
on my wall since middle school.

03:42.456 --> 03:46.293
It's of him conducting
shirtless, on a fjord.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.094
Oh, I had that poster, too.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.062
It was right above my bed.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.701
Okay. Um,
let's get started.

03:54.702 --> 03:58.070
So what I think is really
great about this piece

03:58.071 --> 04:00.139
is the kind
of polarized dynamics.

04:00.140 --> 04:04.611
So there's the tenderness
and then there's the tension.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.045
Oh my God.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.348
Maestro.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.317
Hey, Maestro,
what are you doing here?

04:10.318 --> 04:11.584
I was just in the neighborhood.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.486
My tailor, he lives in Brooklyn.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.723
Yes, he's a genius with buttons.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.458
Well, please carry on, Maestra.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.026
Like I'm not here.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.530
Just think of me as the ghost
that haunts the theater.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.799
Okay. Will do.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.701
All right, so, um.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.004
Let's... let's take it
from the top.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.673
Hmm?

05:08.742 --> 05:10.009
That was so great, guys.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.746
For the...
For the first time, wow.

05:13.747 --> 05:14.648
Okay.

05:14.649 --> 05:16.616
Hey, Esther, I think
that you could

05:16.617 --> 05:18.385
um, afford to be a
little bit freer.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.487
Where it says
molto espressivo...

05:20.488 --> 05:23.456
Hmm.
Oh, bloody hell, no.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.624
What?

05:24.625 --> 05:26.192
Hmm?
Oh, Nothing.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.527
Okay.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.864
The molto espressivo,
I really think, go for it.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.065
- Psst.
- Um...

05:33.066 --> 05:34.568
Psst.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.707
I don't want to be a pest
but I think I've got
a few tiny thoughts.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.008
Okay, yes, what are they?

05:42.009 --> 05:45.578
One, I want you to
think of it as a solo piece,

05:45.579 --> 05:47.480
- and the rest is just echo.
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.949
It's just a very fine
line, but it's important.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.718
- Yes.
- Now, bar one also,

05:51.719 --> 05:53.853
- I want it to be clearer.
- Okay.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.622
- I want it...
- Yeah.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.890
I want you to get the tempo.
It needs to flow.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.091
- Sounds good.
- All right?

05:59.092 --> 06:00.092
- I'll do that.
- Good.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.433
I'm so sorry, Mr. DeSousa.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.701
But we can't give you the loan.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.770
But it's not for me.
It's for the children.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.439
- It's for the music.
- I know.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.575
And the program that
you're trying to start,
it sounds great.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.445
Program? I'm not
doing a TV program.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.146
No, no, no, the music program.

06:20.147 --> 06:23.015
Oh, yeah.
I just don't call it
a music program.

06:23.016 --> 06:28.320
I call it music and
the sounds that make a family.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.556
Well, you...

06:29.557 --> 06:30.990
You applied
for the loan as an individual.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.493
And you listed as assets to
be held as collateral...

06:33.494 --> 06:37.097
Beethoven, Mozart,
and T-chai-Tchaikovsky.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.575
Yeah, I know that one.
I like it.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.810
Oh good.
She likes that one.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.045
Well, now, it was all worth it.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.281
But you do understand in
terms of a loan agreement,

06:55.282 --> 06:58.284
that these are just the
names of music composers.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.019
They don't actually have value.

07:00.020 --> 07:05.658
Tell her that you would have
gone mad without the music.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.760
Oh, no, but I will start
crying if I say that.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.329
Let's see, the only other
thing you listed here

07:10.330 --> 07:14.266
is a mate gourd.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.136
Mat... ma-mate?
Mate gourd?

07:17.137 --> 07:20.940
And the value, it depends
on what a person's
opinion is on mate?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.609
I was joking.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.176
You know, it's just a joke.

07:24.177 --> 07:27.747
Wow you don't have any credit,
which I've never seen before.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.717
- No credit cards? No, no...
- Nothing.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.619
No mortgage, house, nothing?

07:32.620 --> 07:34.821
No, I don't owe any
money to anybody.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.656
That seems like
I don't exist, right?

07:36.657 --> 07:37.657
It's how the bank thinks.

07:37.658 --> 07:38.891
I don't get it.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.693
So the bank will give out
loans to people

07:40.694 --> 07:44.063
who usually will make money back

07:44.064 --> 07:45.532
to pay it back.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.199
I'll just get another loan
and I'll pay you back.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.868
No, but how is the bank
going to trust you?

07:48.869 --> 07:51.037
I give you my word,
it's me, I tell you.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.072
You're the bank.
Trust me.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.140
I'm not the bank.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.808
I just work for the bank.
Excuse me.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.009
I have to be in this meeting.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.611
Okay, okay.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.217
- Okay.
- That's it.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.720
Thanks so much for your time.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.559
I know you're not the bank.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.894
You know, you're
this "Creative Solutions

08:14.895 --> 08:16.996
For Creative Lives" bank.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.131
Listen, at the end of
the day, those are
just slogans.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.366
It's not really real.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.568
Well, let's make this real.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.469
What if I was a potato farmer?

08:23.470 --> 08:24.637
And I come to you and I say,

08:24.638 --> 08:26.072
"hey I want to plant tomatoes."

08:26.073 --> 08:27.206
Mm-hmm.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.609
I want a loan for planting
tomatoes, and you go,

08:29.610 --> 08:31.010
"Have you any experience
with tomatoes?"

08:31.011 --> 08:33.111
And I go, "No.
No, but just give me a loan."

08:33.113 --> 08:35.114
- Well, you wouldn't
give it to me, right?
- No.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.849
- Because I plant potatoes.
- Potatoes.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.586
But what if I come and
I say I'm a tomato farmer.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.121
I'm gonna plant tomatoes.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.591
That's exactly what I'm saying
right now, you know?

08:44.592 --> 08:46.492
I am a musician.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.160
I'm gonna give you the music.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.097
Hi, Jordan.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.932
Where are you?

08:52.933 --> 08:56.268
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry, Honey.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.038
No, hold on.
Just stay there
with your teachers.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.207
I'll be right there.
I'm on my way.

09:01.208 --> 09:05.111
Okay? Okay.
Okay, bye. Dammit.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.446
I forgot that today
was the day I'm supposed
to pick up my son.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.681
Do you need a ride?

09:08.682 --> 09:10.182
No, no, no, it's okay.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.651
Yes, I'll give you a ride.
Come, come, come.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.985
I have a vehicle.
Come.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.921
Oh, okay, okay.
If you don't mind.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.824
Yeah, no, no.
It's good.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.030
He should have stuck
with potatoes.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.888
Okay.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.556
Hey, you really...

09:50.557 --> 09:52.091
I know, I know.
I'm so sorry.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.826
I apologize,
I shouldn't do that.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.494
I'm actually gonna go.

09:55.495 --> 09:56.495
Great.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.264
No. I'm not going to go.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.100
I'm going to go into this
cozy little room

10:01.101 --> 10:02.468
and I'm gonna just take a nap.

10:02.469 --> 10:04.203
- That sounds great
- And I promise you...

10:04.204 --> 10:05.972
- I'll shut the fuck up.
- Thank you.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.074
Okay, um, let's go
from the same place.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.541
So, you can just
drop me off here.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.943
All right?
All right, it's okay.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.812
- Okay, um...
- The door's right here.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.513
Okay, okay. We're here.
Hello, young man.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.215
Hi, can I ask you a favor?

10:16.216 --> 10:18.317
Can you hold my
bicycle for a moment?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.019
Yes, please?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.520
- I have your word?
- You have my word.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.521
Excellent.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.958
Hey, little man.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.128
I'm so sorry, I'll make
it up to you.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.797
Jordan, this is Mr. DeSousa.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.998
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.632
My name is Rodrigo, how are you?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.601
Good.

10:34.602 --> 10:35.802
Do you play the piano?

10:35.803 --> 10:37.670
- No.
- No, he doesn't play anything.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.005
Ooh.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.773
Uh-huh.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.559
Hello!
Who wants to play a game?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.161
Me!

11:02.162 --> 11:05.497
Come gather round
in a circle, come on.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.799
Okay!
Let's make a circle.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.468
Good, great.
Welcome.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.737
Okay. Who's got a heart?

11:10.738 --> 11:12.604
Everybody?
You also have a heart?

11:12.605 --> 11:13.440
You can join, you can join.

11:13.441 --> 11:14.540
Come, come, come.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.376
And what sound does
a heart make?

11:17.377 --> 11:18.377
Boom, boom.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.411
Muy bien.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.355
Okay, so guys, okay, grab
your instruments, please.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.490
And where were we?
We were in the heartbeat.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.524
Right? We're in
the heartbeat.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.393
So how was it, the heartbeat?

11:33.394 --> 11:36.462
So, bop. Okay. Esso.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.766
Can you help us with the
heartbeat with your tubes?

11:41.368 --> 11:44.037
And let's have
the claves going, please.

11:45.939 --> 11:49.375
Bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop. Right.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.044
Bop, bop, bop.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.382
Mississippi, hot dog.
Mississippi, hot dog.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.789
♫ Palo, palo, palo
bonito palo eh ♫

12:03.690 --> 12:07.326
♫ Eh palo bonito palo eh ♫

12:07.327 --> 12:08.627
Rapido!

12:08.628 --> 12:12.231
♫ Palo, palo, palo
bonito palo eh ♫

12:12.232 --> 12:16.003
♫ Eh palo bonito palo eh ♫

12:24.845 --> 12:26.212
Bye, Anthony.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.848
Bye.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.718
You see, that's it.
It's percussions.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.186
Your instrument is percussions.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.255
Absolutely, and
once they find it,

12:36.256 --> 12:37.924
there's no going back,
you know? Yeah.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.358
And you will never sleep again.

12:39.359 --> 12:43.062
- That's exciting.
- But he'll be happy.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.631
Uh, I've got a check for you.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.167
Check?

12:49.970 --> 12:53.039
- It's from you.
- Yeah.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.274
I just wanted to say I like
what you're trying to do.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.375
Thank you.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.244
I should get him
home for dinner now.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.146
Okay.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.549
Well, I can cook one day
for you and him.
You know?

13:03.550 --> 13:06.319
- Can you cook?
- We'll make up something.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.864
Fuck!

13:17.865 --> 13:19.866
Bullshit! Bullshit!

13:19.867 --> 13:21.733
Thomas? Is there
something wrong?

13:21.734 --> 13:23.135
It's the coda!

13:23.136 --> 13:24.736
It's the bloody coda!

13:24.737 --> 13:26.638
I mean, God, I don't know
what the hell I was thinking.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.974
It's derivative bullshit.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.075
Cut it, cut it.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.509
Okay, you want me
to cut the coda?

13:30.510 --> 13:32.678
Yeah, cut the fucker right out
like a country surgeon.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.346
No, do not cut the coda.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.048
The Maestro just said
to cut the coda.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.516
I know, but I'm conducting
so let me handle it.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.885
- Cut it.
- Okay.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.987
Thomas, do not make
this complicated.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.656
It's not derivative,
it's a beautiful
simple love song.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.792
Oh, God, what?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.627
Damn, fuck!

13:48.628 --> 13:51.263
What the hell are you...
you've destroyed this
now for me.

13:51.264 --> 13:54.300
I mean, now I've
got to think about it
like it's a love song?

13:54.301 --> 13:56.068
It's not a fucking love song.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.904
Okay, why don't you just
go home and get some sleep?

13:57.905 --> 13:59.405
In fact, why don't we all
go home and get some sleep?

13:59.406 --> 14:01.073
Then we'll come in
fresh tomorrow.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.641
- I'm done, I'm done!
- Polish this up.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.511
And do the show, no problem.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.751
Yeah, now.

14:12.752 --> 14:15.354
Is everybody good?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.558
Oh, that's good. Okay.

14:19.559 --> 14:22.061
Okay, let's do this right.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.529
I got everybody coffee.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.663
I fixed it.

14:24.664 --> 14:25.664
Uh...

14:25.665 --> 14:27.166
I don't have page three.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.101
You have to tape together
the top of old page four

14:29.102 --> 14:33.005
with the new page 36.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.073
You were right, darling.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.142
You know, it's a love story.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.809
It just needed simplifying.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.111
It was already really simple.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.412
It did not need
to be simplified.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.981
Actually, now it's
just more complicated.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.050
Listen, darling,
I know this is difficult,

14:44.051 --> 14:45.651
and also, it's your first thing.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.054
But listen, I really
want this to be right.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.788
So would you please
just try it for me.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.690
Okay.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.725
Um...

14:53.726 --> 14:55.662
Okay. From the coda,
all right.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.305
Esther, you're playing
something completely different.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.975
It's what the Maestro
wrote, right here?

15:08.976 --> 15:11.177
Okay, but it doesn't go
with anything else.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.279
Yeah, I think that's
actually really cool.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.247
Ben, why are you
just standing there?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.249
There is no Clarinet
part anymore.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.617
I just felt you know, it was,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.086
frosting on frosting...

15:20.087 --> 15:21.620
Okay, that's it.
Come here.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.355
I don't know why you're
doing this to yourself.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.992
But everything that I was trying
to get across in this piece

15:25.993 --> 15:27.026
is no longer there.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.028
It's what the composer wants.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.696
Okay, I just need a minute
with him, Esther, so...

15:30.697 --> 15:33.065
And I just was to make sure
that the Maestro gets
what he needs.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.067
Okay, I'm the conductor
and I will make sure
that the maestro...

15:35.068 --> 15:36.068
Okay, but, Maestro...

15:36.069 --> 15:37.670
Just back the fuck off.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.711
It was such an honor
working with you.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.279
I think you're a genius.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.580
Thank you, darling.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.616
Hey, Esther, um...

15:50.617 --> 15:51.917
Did she just quit?

15:51.918 --> 15:54.186
That's how I interpreted
that, yeah.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.156
Esther, Esther, please,
wait, I'm so, so sorry.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.490
Can we please
just talk about this?

15:58.491 --> 16:00.192
I really thought maybe
you had something.

16:00.193 --> 16:04.296
But I guess what everyone
says about you is true.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.898
Wait. What? What does
everyone say about me?

16:06.899 --> 16:08.500
I have figured it out.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.037
Claude, you are going
to take Shawn's part

16:11.038 --> 16:12.238
and I'm going to rewrite
Esther's part

16:12.239 --> 16:13.639
so that Shawn can play it.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.640
No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.375
Yes, it's totally fine.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.643
- Look.
- I don't want it.
I don't want it.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.944
Are you guys good?

16:18.945 --> 16:20.346
Rodney the Ringman needs to run
through his lighting cues.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.181
We're completely
fucked so we may as well

16:22.182 --> 16:23.749
watch him throw
his rings around.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.950
Bring it on!

16:24.951 --> 16:27.753
Guys, house is open
in fifteen minutes.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.588
I can't do it!

16:29.589 --> 16:30.589
Hailey...

16:30.590 --> 16:33.093
Oh, look at this!

16:33.960 --> 16:34.960
Yeah.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.062
- Shawn!
- Oh my God.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.063
Stop it.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.318
You know, at time like
this I wish my parents
had believed in me.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.120
Well, you know what?
They didn't, so fuck 'em.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.355
Now you've just got to
play with the blood.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.923
All right, does everybody
know what we're doing?

17:04.924 --> 17:06.525
- No.
- Yay!

17:06.526 --> 17:08.426
- No.
- Okay, all right.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.296
Shawn, we are going...

17:10.297 --> 17:11.762
Hailey, this is a nightmare!

17:11.763 --> 17:12.864
I know it's a nightmare,

17:12.865 --> 17:14.333
it's a fucking
horrible nightmare,

17:14.334 --> 17:16.367
and I'm so, so, sorry that
you have to dream it with me,

17:16.368 --> 17:17.703
but we are going to make
something so amazing

17:17.704 --> 17:19.805
if you just hang on
and follow through.

17:19.806 --> 17:20.806
No, we're not.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.115
Hey.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.850
- Hey.
- What is this place?

17:31.851 --> 17:33.319
I have no idea.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.122
I have a friend
performing here tonight.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.156
How are you?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.457
Good.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.626
I scheduled the surgery
for next week.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.827
Did you tell anyone?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.695
No, I mean it's too
hard to tell people.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.165
What am I gonna say?
I'm either off for
two months,

17:46.166 --> 17:49.235
or just gone.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.803
If it doesn't go well.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.208
"Are you whining about
nighttime following
the daylight?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.844
About rain that comes
after sunshine?

17:58.845 --> 18:02.381
Are you complaining that there
are ugly things in life?"

18:02.382 --> 18:06.452
Vítêzslava Kaprálová
died when she was 25.

18:06.453 --> 18:10.922
But before she did, she wrote
and conducted over fifty pieces

18:10.923 --> 18:15.594
at a time when women
were supposed to be
muses, not artists.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.531
So tonight we celebrate
finding our way.

18:24.604 --> 18:32.344
♫ Kdyz straze sve cas vymenuje ♫

18:32.345 --> 18:37.717
♫ V noveho roku znameni ♫

18:43.956 --> 18:48.093
♫ Necht dobre je ♫

18:48.094 --> 18:54.766
♫ Necht dobre je ♫

18:54.767 --> 19:00.672
♫ Necht dobre je
co v budoucnu je ♫

19:00.673 --> 19:07.414
♫ Pokryto v jeho mlceni ♫

19:22.429 --> 19:24.530
And now without further ado

19:24.531 --> 19:27.234
be amazed by The Crystal Fruits.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.738
That was Lizzy.
She's amazing.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.240
Sounds great.

19:34.241 --> 19:37.676
What are you gonna do if they
say you can't play anymore?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.010
It's no if.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.646
They called me this afternoon.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.148
I'm done.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.350
Anyway, this is cool.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.253
What do you mean,
"it's cool?"

19:47.254 --> 19:48.854
I only had a couple years left.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.823
Shit happens, you have
to go to plan B.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.493
- Plan B?
- You don't have one?

19:54.494 --> 19:56.829
I've never thought about it.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.000
Maybe this should be
your plan B.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.004
I think you should go do that.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.906
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.641
You could do that, too.

20:09.642 --> 20:11.009
Yeah.

20:11.010 --> 20:13.279
You could manage, like, six.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.814
Maybe a pie.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.617
Hi, Cynthia.
Oh my God.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.386
Are you Kevin Majors?

20:20.387 --> 20:22.254
Kevin Majors!

20:22.255 --> 20:24.523
Kevin, this is Gloria, my boss.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.925
Yeah. I was there when you
scored those 12 points

20:26.926 --> 20:30.396
against the Spurs,
the last 80 seconds!

20:30.397 --> 20:32.864
You don't know,
this guy's fantastic.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.666
Oh my, he's amazing.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.767
- He's amazing. You're amazing.
- So amazing.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.703
I'm a big fan of you guys too.

20:37.704 --> 20:41.540
Well maybe some time
we could talk about the
Donors Benefits program.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.574
Gloria, why don't you join us?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.942
No, no, no, no.
You know what?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.479
You guys have a
terrific evening together.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.717
Could I have a martini, please?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.721
Shawn, I need you to pay
attention to me right now.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.689
You really just need
to play this note

20:57.690 --> 20:59.325
instead of all of these notes.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.326
It'll still have
the same effect.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.327
Hailey, psst, psst.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.328
What?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.095
I have the solution.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.431
No, no, not now.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.632
I've just reworked four parts.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.066
I am using the weapons at hand.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.335
I am using the weapons at hand.

21:09.336 --> 21:11.236
Well, to use your analogy,

21:11.237 --> 21:13.905
I have a bloody great missile.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.507
Okay, I actually really think
it sounds better this way.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.008
It's a lot simpler.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.477
I don't understand why
it wasn't like this

21:18.478 --> 21:19.678
actually, the entire time.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.348
Fine.

21:22.749 --> 21:23.750
One second.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.554
Ah, Hailey.
Nice to see you.

21:28.555 --> 21:29.888
He owes me a favor.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.123
Actually, after tonight,
I probably owe you one.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.959
Joshua Bell.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.462
Hey, I know you probably
don't normally do gigs

21:36.463 --> 21:37.896
of this size, but...

21:37.897 --> 21:39.965
You know this guy
gave me my first big break

21:39.966 --> 21:41.567
when I was, what, 14 years old?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.502
I think we're gonna have fun.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.871
Have you had a chance
to look over the part?

21:45.872 --> 21:48.907
Well, um, you know,
I would like your input.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.810
Maybe you can just give me
an idea of your vision?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.212
There are just a
few things that I...

21:54.213 --> 21:55.246
Totally, totally.
Lizzy!

21:55.247 --> 21:56.382
What?

21:56.383 --> 21:58.283
I need you to vamp
for five minutes.

21:58.284 --> 21:59.418
What? Why? Why?

21:59.419 --> 22:00.519
Why, why?

22:00.520 --> 22:03.389
Oh, shit Joshua Bell?
Hi.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.857
Um...
Yes, I was born to vamp.

22:05.858 --> 22:08.827
Okay, so, this part where
it says molto espressivo,

22:08.828 --> 22:10.696
- I really think it's
important that we honor it.
- Molto.

22:10.697 --> 22:13.532
We have a saying here in Prague:

22:13.533 --> 22:17.202
Stokrát nic umorilo osla.

22:17.203 --> 22:23.108
A hundred times and nothing
killed the donkey.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.176
This reminds me of home.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.245
Are you in the circus?

22:27.246 --> 22:28.447
No?

22:28.448 --> 22:29.681
You can tell me.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.249
How's your conducting technique?

22:31.250 --> 22:33.084
Um, I hope it's good.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.986
I mean, I've been
learning from the best.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.588
Thomas is...

22:36.589 --> 22:39.491
Actually, it's more about
what's inside here

22:39.492 --> 22:42.060
than what you do
with your hands.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.829
If we were following you,

22:43.830 --> 22:45.664
have a good idea of
what's in your brain,

22:45.665 --> 22:47.298
if you convey that in some way,

22:47.299 --> 22:48.834
- Whether it's like this
or like this...
- Uh-huh.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.837
- It'll be successful, so um...
- Yeah.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.639
And you seem to
know what you want.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.941
I'm happy to hear
that it seems that way.

22:56.744 --> 22:58.176
You two.

22:58.177 --> 23:01.046
Have you kissed her yet?

23:01.047 --> 23:02.748
No.

23:02.749 --> 23:08.654
It's almost midnight and
Communism will be here at 1 am.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.522
Come on, what
are you waiting for?

23:16.162 --> 23:17.864
Aw...

23:22.368 --> 23:24.035
And you, madam?

23:24.036 --> 23:26.906
How do you feel about
the rise of the proletariat?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.546
Weird answer.

23:48.961 --> 23:54.332
Hello. I'm very excited to
present to you a new work

23:54.333 --> 23:56.134
by Thomas Pembridge.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.971
Um, uh, Thomas, would you
like to say anything?

23:59.972 --> 24:03.109
Hmm, Sure, sure.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.283
Thank you very much.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.586
Hailey.

24:14.587 --> 24:18.356
All these wonderful
young musicians.

24:18.357 --> 24:21.092
And thank you to Joshua.

24:21.093 --> 24:24.630
You know, I wrote
this for a friend.

24:24.631 --> 24:28.066
Who means a lot to me.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.736
She has my heart, but of course,

24:30.737 --> 24:33.271
I don't see her
anywhere here, so...

24:33.272 --> 24:35.273
There you go.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.742
Anyway, um...

24:36.743 --> 24:39.077
In the words of Aristotle...

24:39.078 --> 24:41.412
Fuck me, really?

24:41.413 --> 24:44.049
Aw, fuck it.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.022
Na zdraví.
