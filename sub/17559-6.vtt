10:29.795 --> 10:31.756
So I think...stairs.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.342
So the clock's ticking. I got
30 seconds to get up there.

10:34.425 --> 10:37.053
I hit the eighth floor landing,
and there's this huge dude

10:37.136 --> 10:40.306
just standing there and he's
like, "Give me the envelope."

10:40.389 --> 10:43.017
And I'm, like, "Dude, take it up
with the lawyer guy.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.477
I got a job to do."

10:44.560 --> 10:47.313
So I make a move, and the guy
puts his hand in his pocket

10:47.396 --> 10:48.939
and pulls out a freakin' gun.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.441
- Oh, my God!
- I know!

10:50.524 --> 10:53.402
So...so I blow past him

10:53.486 --> 10:55.029
and run up the stairs
as fast as I can.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.031
- And?
- He shot me.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.783
Oh, my God.
In the knee?

10:58.866 --> 11:01.160
No. In the neck.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.578
The bullet traveled
down my neck

11:02.661 --> 11:05.039
through my heart,
out my lung

11:05.122 --> 11:07.083
around my six-pack

11:07.166 --> 11:09.668
down the leg, out the knee.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.838
You're the biggest liar.

11:13.964 --> 11:14.965
Yeah.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.176
But you didn't
feel a thing, did you?

12:25.870 --> 12:27.955
It's crisp outside today.

- Nothing happened.

- I'm not thinking anything.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.798
I got up this morning,
got dressed for the gym

12:37.882 --> 12:39.383
took my cup of coffee
out to the terrace

12:39.467 --> 12:42.261
and saw my little sister
sleeping with Vince.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.512
Typical morning.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.222
Okay, look,
we came home last night.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.515
We were wide awake from coffee.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.933
He put the grill together.
we talked

12:48.017 --> 12:49.810
we fell asleep, and that's it.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.021
- Okay.
- Nothing happened.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.689
You know, for somebody
who claims nothing happened

12:53.772 --> 12:55.065
you're awfully defensive.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.817
I'm being defensive
because I know that you think

12:56.901 --> 12:59.695
I fell under his
mysterious powers.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.281
And, um, is that his coat?

13:02.364 --> 13:05.117
Yes, it's Vincent's
coat of love.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.046
- Oh, God.
- What?

13:17.129 --> 13:20.049
- I saw the sniff.
- The sniff?

13:20.132 --> 13:22.551
- Yes, you sniffed his jacket.
- When?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.136
Oh. And you don't even know
you did it.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.763
Oh, my God, you're crazy.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.014
I'm just trying to protect you.

- From what?
- From that!

13:29.225 --> 13:30.726
- The player!
- Okay, you know what?

13:30.809 --> 13:32.228
Maybe I should
be the one protecting you.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.395
From what?

13:33.479 --> 13:34.897
Is somebody putting on
a little extra gloss

13:34.980 --> 13:38.067
for the gym, a little rouge
for the player?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.110
Okay, this has nothing
to do with Peter.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.655
I didn't even say Peter. Ha!

13:42.738 --> 13:44.990
Okay, look, I'm not going to let
you turn this around on me.

13:45.074 --> 13:48.035
Ah. For someone who doesn't like
Peter, you sure are defensive.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.620
- He's a jerk.
- Cute top.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.872
- But he's not my type.
- Is it new?

the whole thing at the club

14:18.691 --> 14:20.359
about that girl kissing me.
And you're right.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.611
- I'm going to tell Jill.
- You know, I never met Jill.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.948
But it'll be awesome
to watch her break up with you.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.033
You know, I've given
some thought to that myself

14:28.117 --> 14:30.494
and, you know, I think
Tina might've been right.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.288
Why tell Jill something
that might hurt her?

14:32.371 --> 14:35.124
I mean, things happen, things
you don't expect or plan on

14:35.207 --> 14:37.543
it's a crazy, mixed-up world.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.962
Alright, wait, wait.
What's going on?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.338
Okay, something happened
last night

14:41.422 --> 14:42.923
and I really need to
talk to you about it

14:43.007 --> 14:44.675
but you have to promise me
you won't tell anybody.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.135
Oh, but, come on, Holly,
it's me.

And who's Tina going to tell?
She ain't got no friends.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.641
Okay. So you know that Henry
was studying last night.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.727
- Yeah.
- Vince and I were hanging out..

14:54.810 --> 14:57.062
- Oh, God.
- No, it wasn't like that.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.522
He was putting
our barbecue together.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.857
It got late, we fell asleep

14:59.940 --> 15:01.567
and I woke up and he was there.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.445
Nothing happened,
but I kind of got some feelings

15:04.528 --> 15:05.779
that I don't think
I should be having

15:05.863 --> 15:06.947
when I have a boyfriend.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.407
Oh, my God, how did Vince feel?

15:08.490 --> 15:09.575
I don't know.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.701
Alright, well,
let me ask you this.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.036
Would it make a difference
if Vince

15:12.119 --> 15:13.704
felt the same way
you feel right now?

15:13.787 --> 15:15.789
No.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.166
I don't think so.

to yourself or.. Henry!

to yell at me about it.

- I feel bad enough already.
- Hey.

out of your contract

she'd take care of it.

I thought you wanted to leave.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.419

to get in trouble?

at the edge of the grill.

was totally burnt.

that you remember that.
