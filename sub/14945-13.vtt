NARRATOR:
Previously on Continuum...

00:02.879 --> 00:03.868
You call them Freelancers.

00:05.131 --> 00:06.120
They have tattoos.

00:06.591 --> 00:09.082
It’s a series of dots
between their fingers.

00:09.177 --> 00:11.293
It's the DNA results
from that test
that I did on Jason.

00:11.429 --> 00:12.509
He's my father.

00:12.597 --> 00:15.259
Ms. Cathers was working
on a high security project
for SadTech.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.302
This case is being
bumped upstairs.

00:17.393 --> 00:19.475
But, sir...
Officer Cameron, dismissed.

00:19.729 --> 00:20.935
This feels great!

00:21.105 --> 00:22.185
This is what you want?

00:23.316 --> 00:24.305
(SCREAMING) No!

00:24.400 --> 00:25.389
Emily!

00:35.661 --> 00:37.037
Whatever this is,

00:37.121 --> 00:39.032
it got that SadTech
engineer killed.

00:39.290 --> 00:41.531
And it has something to do
with the Liber8 executions.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.625
My supervisor
purged the record.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.373
Like it didn't even happen.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.421
But you're not gonna leave
it at that, are you?

00:51.636 --> 00:54.378
Someone was murdered
for this information.

00:55.473 --> 00:56.633
And it's my case.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.642
Even if CPS
wants to bury it.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.989
She uncovered a possible
Liber8 escape plot

01:19.080 --> 01:20.695
involving an
explosive device.

01:21.457 --> 01:23.914
And a connection
to a murdered
SadTech engineer.

01:24.627 --> 01:26.913
lWlhavetolook
into this.
Of course.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.336
But please, let me know
if anything comes of it.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.331
Is there something else?

01:33.177 --> 01:35.293
My wife is supposed
to work the execution.

01:35.388 --> 01:36.844
I don't want to
bother Mr. Sadler,

01:36.931 --> 01:38.387
unless there's
a verifiable threat.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.180
I know exactly
what you mean.

01:40.351 --> 01:41.966
I'll keep her away
from the action.

01:42.061 --> 01:43.767
Make sure nothing
happens to her.

01:43.854 --> 01:44.889
Thank you.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.856
His wife is the officer
who investigated
the murder of our friend.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.612
What if she digs deeper?

01:56.575 --> 01:58.861
There's something to be
said for a cop with

01:58.953 --> 02:00.864
determination, integrity,
and a...

02:01.122 --> 02:03.033
Desire to uncover the truth.

02:03.666 --> 02:04.997
We don't see
much of that these days.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.493
We're in
a delicate position.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.292
Leave it with me.
I'll see that steps
are taken.

02:15.428 --> 02:16.713
Yes, sir.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.890
No!
Kiera?

02:31.736 --> 02:32.725
Are you okay?

02:33.321 --> 02:34.686
My head is killing me.

02:35.323 --> 02:37.279
Okay, um, let me
get you something.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.364
I've got some meds
from our travel kit.

02:40.828 --> 02:44.491
It feels like
something went wrong
with my CMR.

02:45.750 --> 02:46.739
Your CMR?

02:54.592 --> 02:56.548
Today is the day.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.584
The end of Liber8 injustice.

02:58.679 --> 02:59.668
Finally.

03:02.433 --> 03:03.798
Ah, it feels...

03:05.728 --> 03:06.888
What's this?

03:13.861 --> 03:14.850
Work thing.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.525
You all right?

03:23.621 --> 03:25.703
Yeah, it's funny.
It's like a memory

03:25.790 --> 03:28.372
that's almost there
and then it's gone.

03:29.627 --> 03:30.787
That ever happen to you?

03:31.629 --> 03:32.960
All the time.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.508
You know what?
lwas thinking we could
meet after work?

03:39.595 --> 03:40.960
Go to the prison together?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.931
Sounds great.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.465
Kiera.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.853
See you after work,
sweetheart.

03:52.650 --> 03:54.015
Meet you on the train.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.475
Have a good day.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.367
Very funny, mister.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.904
You can have him
when you're done.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.206
Soy milk, again?

04:17.007 --> 04:20.249
The Liber8 terrorists
don't know that
we've uncovered their plot.

04:20.344 --> 04:25.179
They'll find out too late
and the execution
will unfold as it must.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.881
Why let the charade
go so far?

04:26.976 --> 04:28.887
Because so long as they think
they have a chance of escape,

04:28.978 --> 04:31.435
we can ferret out
their co-conspirators
on the outside!

04:31.689 --> 04:34.852
Their false hope
gives us a powerful
means of control.

04:37.194 --> 04:39.446
Control I mean to
preserve at all costs.

04:41.907 --> 04:43.238
That's all for now.

04:49.165 --> 04:51.326
You have an explanation?
I had no choice.

04:51.584 --> 04:54.496
Ramona Cathers
was approached by someone
with inside knowledge.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.919
She was going to expose us.
Approached by whom?

04:57.006 --> 04:58.291
A sect of some kind.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.047
Believers.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.048
They are aware
of your research

05:02.136 --> 05:04.593
and claim a dogmatic
responsibility to intervene.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.800
The Freelancers.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.222
Excuse me?

05:11.353 --> 05:12.388
Stay on this.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.811
Report directly to me.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.775
We need to take this
Freelancer threat seriously.

05:23.866 --> 05:26.448
That's precisely why
I invited you here today.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.818
You're the only one
I can trust with this.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.577
I won't let you down.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.291
KIERA: 2077.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.334
My time, my city, my family.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.872
When terrorists killed
thousands of innocents,

05:40.966 --> 05:42.422
they were condemned to die.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.795
They had other plans.

05:43.886 --> 05:46.502
A time travel device
sent us all back 65 years.

05:46.597 --> 05:47.552
/ want to get home,

05:47.640 --> 05:50.882
but / can’t be sure
what / will return to
if history is changed.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.011
Their plan,

05:52.102 --> 05:55.435
to corrupt
and control the present
in order to win the future.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.263
What they didn’t plan on
was me.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.699
Hope this has something
to do with our
previous conversation.

06:16.794 --> 06:18.659
You sat right
next to Emily

06:18.754 --> 06:20.540
and pretended
not to know her.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.371
lsenther
to protect you, Alec.

06:22.758 --> 06:24.544
Protect me
and steal from me!

06:24.843 --> 06:26.708
When Emily developed
feelings for you,

06:26.804 --> 06:29.671
I worried at first
that she would
compromise herself.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.222
But an agent devoted
to the subject, Alec,

06:32.309 --> 06:33.845
is an agent devoted
to the cause.

06:33.936 --> 06:35.392
Well, I'm glad itwas
convenient for you,

06:35.479 --> 06:37.140
because she's dead,
you asshole!

06:40.317 --> 06:42.979
You know, if you'd
never done this,
she'd still be alive.

06:43.279 --> 06:45.395
But you gave her thatjob,
to protect me!

06:45.489 --> 06:46.524
And now...

06:46.615 --> 06:48.571
Alec, I'm sorry.
I'm truly sorry.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.774
That wasn't my intent.

06:50.869 --> 06:53.155
You know, I don't even
know why I came here.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.280
Except for to make
you realize that
I hold you responsible.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.038
lfyou want me
to bear responsibility,
I will.

07:00.838 --> 07:03.250
Now tell me what happened,
help me to understand.

07:05.509 --> 07:09.093
The woman is Maya Hartwell.
22, no fixed address.

07:10.014 --> 07:11.254
You ID the suits?

07:11.348 --> 07:12.884
Yeah, we think
they're affiliated
with the same group

07:12.975 --> 07:14.681
that stole the Liber8 corpses
from the morgue.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.929
So possibly connected
to Gardiner's death.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.563
Oh, I'd say
it's a good bet.

07:18.856 --> 07:21.438
You're trying
to exonerate Cameron,
| see that.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.436
But you were supposed
to bring her in.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.642
Now, CSlS thinks that
you're involved

07:25.738 --> 07:27.444
and that's put me
in a bad position.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.396
I need her in here
and I need her to answer
these questions,

07:29.491 --> 07:30.901
ifyou want
to move past this.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.200
She's being pursued
and she's gone to ground.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.989
You'd do the same thing.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.203
lwish I shared
your belief in her.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.040
Just call off the APB.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.667
Get CSlS off her tail.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.377
Just like that?

07:44.965 --> 07:46.080
All is forgiven?

07:46.175 --> 07:47.631
You want her to come in?

07:47.885 --> 07:50.046
She has to feel like
she has a safe landing.

07:51.347 --> 07:53.963
Let her know that she
still has friends here.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.179
I'll do my best.

Carlos, are you okay?

08:07.613 --> 08:09.604
Yeah, I didn't
fall off a roof. You?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.029
What happened to Emily?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.781
I need you to tag
Fonnegra's call, now.

08:14.912 --> 08:15.901
Now!

08:18.749 --> 08:20.114
Carlos?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.287
She's dead.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.622
Kiera, you tried your best.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.212
That's debatable.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.714
You need to come in.
I can protect you here.

08:34.098 --> 08:36.430
Yeah, I...
l have to talk to Alec first.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.396

Hey, get me Ed Lam
in internal affairs, please.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.998
Here he is.
Hey, guys!

09:12.261 --> 09:13.546
I would've happily
come to visit

09:13.637 --> 09:15.138
if you'd simply invited me.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.141
I got a text message

09:18.267 --> 09:20.383
from my source inside
the police department.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.810
Why are Kiera Cameron,
Alec Sadler and Escher

09:24.148 --> 09:26.104
meeting at Piron
right now as we speak?

09:27.526 --> 09:29.107
What're they up to, Matthew?

09:31.447 --> 09:33.859
Answer the question
or I'm gonna blow
your hand off.

09:33.949 --> 09:34.938
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:35.033 --> 09:37.649
Easy now, let's not make
any snap decisions.
We had a deal.

don't listen to what
I have to say.

Changes everything.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.875
Blow his hand off.
No! Listen to me!

09:46.962 --> 09:48.668
I predicted
Escher was gonna
be a problem!

09:48.756 --> 09:50.997
Yeah, for you.
For me! Tell that to Garza!

09:52.342 --> 09:53.422
What about Garza?

09:53.510 --> 09:55.421
Whoever snatched her
is connected to Escher.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.377
Which makes him
a problem for all of us.

a moment please, Marco?

Escher's got an
anti-matter power source.

of Piron to set it up.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.636
When that thing
works again,

10:43.727 --> 10:45.308
a guy like Escher
is gonna use it.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.101
What if he goes back?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.477
And?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.640
He goes back in time
to before we get here,

and then kills us all
upon arrival.

when she was shot?

She was until Kiera went
after the device.

Leaving an unarmed Emily
to fend for herself.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.730

on Kiera.

to play in all this.

had an abiding interest
in you.

and Kiera arrived
in this time,

stand in the shadows.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.697
The fire had
to be authentic.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.152
For me to protect you.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.533
It was the only thing
that I kept.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.135
No, keep it.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.598
Keep it!

12:46.558 --> 12:48.389
I know it's a lot
to process.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.478
With everything
I've learned...

12:51.021 --> 12:52.352
The work
you've left behind...

12:52.439 --> 12:53.940
What I've done,
what you've done.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.889
It's like we've been
working together
this whole time.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.733
l was hoping
you'd see it that way.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.396
It's directly below us.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.322
Something that I think
will bring us
closer together.

13:06.203 --> 13:07.318
KIERA: Alec?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.120
What're you doing here?

13:10.207 --> 13:11.697
I heard about Emily.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.376
I'm so sorry.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.784
You should
have been by her side.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.202
That's what you
were supposed to do.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.037
lfyou had,
she'd still be alive!

13:20.634 --> 13:21.874
I made a decision

13:22.678 --> 13:24.589
that I thought
was the right one.

13:25.097 --> 13:26.507
Yeah, for you.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.388
It's my only chance
to see my son.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.843
l reacted...
Your selfishness
killed her!

13:34.356 --> 13:36.062
Alec, I know this hurts.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.983
But Escher is the one that
put Emily in harm's way.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.152
He put her there
to protect me.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.609
He's manipulating you.

13:45.701 --> 13:47.737
(GUN COCKS)
Hands where I can
see them, Cameron!

13:52.582 --> 13:53.833
Alec, I never
meant to hurt you.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.248
In any way, I'm sorry.

13:55.669 --> 13:56.658
(HANDCUFFS CLOSE)

14:00.507 --> 14:02.463
Alec, I know what
you must think of me.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.299
And I probably deserve it.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.758
But that man
cannot be trusted.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.434
He's family.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.884
What do you know about that?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.768
Get her out of here.

14:20.152 --> 14:21.733
Alec. Alec, please.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.230
I will always blame you.

14:23.321 --> 14:24.777
Do you understand me?

14:24.865 --> 14:26.275
Always.

(SIREN WAlLlNG)

14:48.764 --> 14:49.719
Kiera?

14:49.806 --> 14:52.013
Look, lknow
you can’t talk but...

14:52.100 --> 14:53.385
You were right
about everything.

14:53.477 --> 14:56.219
Emily, Escher...
He ’3 up to something.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.599
He told me he installed
an anti-matter machine
here at Piron.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.639
lfyou can somehow
get out of this jam

15:00.942 --> 15:02.148
and get
the time travel device,

15:02.694 --> 15:03.683
I'll be able to
send you home,

15:03.779 --> 15:05.315
and this whole
nightmare will be over.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.158
Thanks, Alec.

15:28.053 --> 15:29.133
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

15:47.739 --> 15:49.570
You tracked
my phone call to Kiera.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.190
I had my orders.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.615
Thought you lost
a taste for that.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.953
You're just lucky
you weren't with her,

15:54.037 --> 15:55.197
or you would have
been arrested, too.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.665
Yeah, well, I have
a feeling that's not far off.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.959
I don't know
what's happening
here anymore.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.283
You know, Betty.

16:01.545 --> 16:03.501
You just haven't decided
what you're gonna do
about it yet.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.668
I need you to requisition
some evidence
from lock-up.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.553
Can you do that for me?

16:13.682 --> 16:15.047
That's not
what I usually do.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.054
Yeah, does anything
around here lately
match that description?

16:19.521 --> 16:21.102
Are you gonna
do this for me,

16:21.189 --> 16:23.805
or am I gonna tell Dillon
that you're the Liber8 mole?

16:27.779 --> 16:29.440
I talked to a contact at lA.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.396
He traced
your calls and texts.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.320
You did the rest.

16:35.579 --> 16:36.864
What happens now?

16:41.251 --> 16:42.582
That depends.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.254
DILLON: Carlos says
I've got it wrong.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.760
He thinks that you've been
set up for Gardiner's murder.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.297
Says there's something
unusual about the evidence.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.641
It's all just
a little too neat.

16:59.728 --> 17:00.888
It's funny.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.808
Of all the people
that I've met
since I arrived here,

17:05.150 --> 17:07.311
I would have picked you
as one who knew me.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.735
Trusted me, even.

17:11.406 --> 17:13.567
lwould have picked me
to be that guy, too.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.403
But things change.
Not things...

17:17.204 --> 17:18.239
You.

17:19.456 --> 17:21.412
You lost what you had
when Nora showed up,

17:21.499 --> 17:24.161
and you wanted
to get it back
no matter what the cost.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.119
You didn't care
who got hurt in the process.

17:30.217 --> 17:33.050
We have enough
to charge you
for Gardiner's murder.

17:33.637 --> 17:36.379
And it doesn't really matter
whether I trust you or not.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.467
CSIS is gonna come in here.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.386
They're gonna take over
this investigation,

17:40.477 --> 17:43.264
and they are going to
corroborate the ties
to you and Liber8.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.344
Let me guess.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.805
Escher is providing them
with the evidence?

17:49.861 --> 17:50.976
Kiera.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.896
You know
you could buy yourself
some goodwill here.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.535
Just tell me what you know.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.499
I'll go to bat for you.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.325
The way you used to go
to bat for all of us?

18:06.878 --> 18:09.369
There's no need
for you in here, Detective.

18:09.464 --> 18:10.829
I'm okay, Carlos.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.553
What the hell is that?

18:19.432 --> 18:20.763
I'm sorry.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.556
For what?
For this.

18:26.648 --> 18:28.104
You shouldn't have
done that.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.853
Yeah, there's an epidemic
of that going around lately.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.777
Carlos, don't!
You're throwing away
your career.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.399
I know how much
it means to you.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.073
The career I want
isn't here anymore.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.406
You need to get home.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.285
You better go.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.045
Ever since I got here,

18:54.884 --> 18:59.127
you were the one person
who never failed me.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.514
Look, save the speech
for when you get home.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.432
That is what
you're doing, right?

19:06.229 --> 19:08.436
I don't think I'll be
around in 2077 but...

19:08.940 --> 19:10.521
Look me up, will you?

19:11.234 --> 19:12.974

of this mess.

Don't throw away
your whole life.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.468
Just come back
inside, please.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.466
I know we can figure
this out together.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.218
It's way too late for that.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.222
I'm a cop, Betty.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.345
I still want that
to mean something.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.438
Why don't you come with me?

20:39.239 --> 20:40.820
Where would we go?

20:42.283 --> 20:43.739
I don't know...

20:43.910 --> 20:45.491
We'll figure something out.

20:51.501 --> 20:52.832
Hey, who's there?

20:53.670 --> 20:54.659
Jason!

20:55.130 --> 20:56.745
Are you okay?
Yeah.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.424
Ithink so.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.665
You come here
to hide as well?

21:00.927 --> 21:01.962
To hide?

21:02.053 --> 21:03.554
Yeah, from the Freelancers?

21:04.431 --> 21:06.387
Yes, Ithink
it's safe here.

21:06.516 --> 21:08.302
Yeah? Oh, good.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.600
KELLOG:
Looking for something?

21:14.774 --> 21:16.014
Where's the device, Kellog?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.103
Safe.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.694
It's not gonna work
without this.

21:22.407 --> 21:23.943
I wasn't planning
on going anywhere.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.739
Well, I'm not
in the mood for games.

21:25.827 --> 21:26.816
What do you want?

21:26.911 --> 21:28.117
I've been thinking about it.

21:28.204 --> 21:29.910
Sometimes you get
so deep into the game,

21:29.998 --> 21:31.704
that you lose
sight of the goal.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.780
Of the win.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.707
I don't have a lot of time.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.292
That could be true.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.922
She's nowhere.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.338
Surveillance cameras?
Nothing.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.094
Like she wasn't even here.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.516
But I found Fonnegra.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.894
So to speak.

21:59.194 --> 22:01.150
I need everyone's attention.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.357
As of this moment,

22:05.283 --> 22:07.399
Kiera Cameron
is public enemy number one.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.360
She should be
considered armed,

22:10.830 --> 22:13.697
and extremely dangerous.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.747
lfyou encounter
Agent Cameron,

22:18.379 --> 22:20.335
take all
necessary precautions.

22:22.926 --> 22:24.882
Add Carlos Fonnegra
as number two.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.093
He's done.

22:33.645 --> 22:34.930
Give me
the device, Matthew.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.224
Matthew?

22:37.315 --> 22:39.931
That might
be endearing if it wasn't
so damn manipulative.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.107
This is no manipulation.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.940
This is
a straight up threat.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.190
You give me the device,
or I kill you.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.821
It's as simple as that.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.279
The device isn't here.

22:55.542 --> 22:58.784
And killing me
won't solve your
bigger problem.

22:58.962 --> 23:01.669
But it would
make me feel
so much better.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.039
What bigger problem?

23:05.134 --> 23:06.670
EscheL

23:06.803 --> 23:08.293
Travis...

23:08.388 --> 23:10.049
Who knows what else.

23:10.139 --> 23:11.345
What are they called?

23:11.432 --> 23:12.638
Freelancers?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.095
You wanna get home.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.431
You'll need to save the kid.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.645
Your investment at risk?

23:22.151 --> 23:23.812
Alec is in danger.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.187
Kiera, he's right.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.065
Alec needs you...

23:30.159 --> 23:33.322
Alec doesn't know
how dangerous Escher is.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.581
I bring you Alec,

23:49.596 --> 23:51.632
you bring me
the rest of the device.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.680
And feel free
to take out Escher
as your gratuity.

24:01.024 --> 24:04.608
When I was
yourage,youngen

24:06.154 --> 24:08.110
IbeHeved
in the value of technology.

24:10.533 --> 24:11.989
People believe that
they are free,

24:12.076 --> 24:14.567
but the reality is
they've never been
more enslaved.

24:16.998 --> 24:20.456
So you intend
to re-write history
using these convicts?

24:20.543 --> 24:22.750
Liber8 wouldn't exist
if it weren't for me.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.082
Perhaps they're
nothing more

24:25.173 --> 24:27.255
than a manifestation
of my conscience.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.048
What if you're wrong?

24:31.346 --> 24:33.507
What if they go back
and nothing changes?

24:33.890 --> 24:35.255
Plan fails?

24:35.725 --> 24:37.056
I have to try.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.263
To do otherwise...

24:41.689 --> 24:43.225
I couldn't live with that.

24:44.734 --> 24:46.224
Or die With it.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.400
Ensure that the
power generator
in the room below

24:51.491 --> 24:53.072
triggers the device.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.654
Send them back.

24:58.873 --> 24:59.988
Why me?

25:00.083 --> 25:02.995
Because you'll
inherit my failure
if I don't succeed.

25:03.753 --> 25:05.493
And I wouldn't
wish that on anyone.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.757
You can count
on me, Father.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.862
This technology
isn't supposed
to be possible!

25:32.949 --> 25:34.439
No, it isn't.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.612
It's a launch pad, Alec.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.659
To the past, to the future.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.622
To our future, Alec.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.621
But we need the device
to make it work.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.673
Kiera will never give it up.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.629
SADLER:
She doesn’t trust you.

26:04.564 --> 26:06.429
What ifyou gave her
a second chance?

26:07.108 --> 26:08.473
She feels guilty
about what happened,

26:08.568 --> 26:10.229
convince her that you
want to send her home.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.775
I'm not that good
of a liar.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.980
ESCHER: It’s simple
ifyou cloak it in
the truth, Alec.

26:17.827 --> 26:19.442
Okay, what am I telling her?

26:19.704 --> 26:21.820
That you've hacked
the security protocols.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.492
Gained access to the lab
on the 34th floor.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.127
34th floor, good to know.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.757
Hello, Kellog!

26:32.717 --> 26:34.673
Nice place you got here.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.755
I'm just here to check up
on our little arrangement.

26:44.353 --> 26:45.968
She's on her way.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.195
You're one of them!

26:56.532 --> 26:58.033
I used to be.

26:58.743 --> 27:01.075
The Freelancers
recruited me,

27:01.370 --> 27:02.576
when I was your age.

27:03.372 --> 27:04.407
So Mom knew
about everything?

27:04.499 --> 27:05.579
No.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.623
She thought
I'd been murdered.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.957
That's why she never
said anything to anyone.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.583
She was afraid.

27:12.673 --> 27:13.628
And the fire?

27:13.716 --> 27:15.217
I wanted out.

27:15.301 --> 27:16.916
It wasn't an option.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.126
I could handle
the Freelancers
coming after me,

27:19.222 --> 27:20.883
but not the two of you.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.221
The death of Marc Sadler
made you both safe.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.721
Or it did until Kiera
showed up.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.386
Kiera? What is that
supposed to mean?

27:29.232 --> 27:30.972
Kiera changed everything.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.162
He's expecting you.

27:51.254 --> 27:52.664
I know.

29:04.285 --> 29:06.241
Thanks for getting me
the suit, Protector.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.695
Makes me feel
whole again.

29:10.166 --> 29:11.656
(GROANS)

29:11.792 --> 29:13.407
Playing field's even, now.

29:22.887 --> 29:24.843
You really think
you can beat me?

29:35.524 --> 29:36.513
(GROANS)

29:53.209 --> 29:54.198
(GROANS)

29:54.293 --> 29:56.124
Didn't have to end
like this, Cameron.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.123
You could have
joined our fight.

29:58.714 --> 29:59.703
(YELLS)

29:59.799 --> 30:01.164
When are you
gonna wake up?

30:01.258 --> 30:03.044
You're the villain
in this tale.

30:11.894 --> 30:12.974
(GROANING)

30:21.278 --> 30:22.529
Where are you going?

30:22.738 --> 30:24.603
We both know this fight
won't go the distance.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.064
I'm going to get Alec,

30:26.158 --> 30:27.989
get Kiera's piece of
the time travel device,

30:28.077 --> 30:29.237
before the police
clean up the place.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.738
No, you stay here.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.154
Our deal was I give you
Kiera and Escher,

30:33.249 --> 30:34.910
in return for Alec
being left alone.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.540
I am a man of my word.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.041
Don't touch that!

31:05.448 --> 31:08.940
I'm gonna make
Sadler pay for this!

31:09.452 --> 31:11.317
For this pathetic life.

31:19.003 --> 31:19.992
But first...

31:20.629 --> 31:22.540
I'll start with you!

31:34.226 --> 31:36.012
Too bad, Cameron.

31:36.979 --> 31:38.139
(GROANS)

32:02.505 --> 32:03.494
(GRUNTS)

32:40.793 --> 32:42.749
You should have
stayed home, Protector.

32:51.345 --> 32:52.334
(GROANS)

32:57.643 --> 32:58.632
(SCREAMS)

33:18.581 --> 33:19.741
(COCKS)

33:21.709 --> 33:22.698
(GROANS)

33:26.922 --> 33:28.628
I don't know
who you people are.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.919
But this isn't
business anymore.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.592
This is personal.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.053
(GUNSHOT)

33:56.118 --> 33:57.153
Hi.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.776
Perhaps you can help me.

33:58.871 --> 34:01.237
Any idea where
the anti-matter lab is?

34:01.749 --> 34:04.786
I'm very glad
you're a man
of your word.

34:07.588 --> 34:08.953
Oh, Matthew.

34:09.173 --> 34:10.162
What is it?

34:10.257 --> 34:12.213
Things have spun out
of control in this time.

34:13.302 --> 34:16.294
Trouble is
waiting for me
at every corner.

34:16.388 --> 34:18.344
And I fear it's only
gonna get worse.

34:19.683 --> 34:22.971
Are you reneging
on our deal?

34:24.688 --> 34:26.224
Quite the opposite.

34:30.611 --> 34:31.817
I'm coming with you.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.162
What happened to you?

34:44.708 --> 34:46.664
Travis happened.

34:48.462 --> 34:50.123
But he's dead now.

34:50.547 --> 34:51.832
Where's Escher?

34:52.424 --> 34:53.880
I bought us some time.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.258
This could have been me.

34:57.888 --> 34:59.389
Hey, a guy can dream.

34:59.473 --> 35:00.883
What is he doing here?

35:01.684 --> 35:03.174
I'll explain later.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.685
Are you sure
you can do this?

35:08.482 --> 35:10.018
Let's find out.

35:21.745 --> 35:22.734
KIERA: How much time
do we have

35:22.830 --> 35:24.366
before Escher figures out
what we're up to?

35:24.498 --> 35:25.533
SADLER: Not long.

35:25.833 --> 35:26.822
Okay, I'm gonna
send you back,

35:26.917 --> 35:28.077
just prior to the moment
youleﬁ.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.157
VVhy?

35:29.253 --> 35:30.789
Becauseifyou
don't stop Liber8
from traveling back

35:30.879 --> 35:33.040
the first time,
then your future
remains uncertain.

35:34.091 --> 35:36.958
But ifyou send me
back from before the time
that I came

35:37.052 --> 35:38.087
then there could...

35:38.178 --> 35:39.167
There could be two of you?

35:39.263 --> 35:40.423
Yeah, possibly.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.554
I don't know,
maybe the time continuum
won't allow for it

35:44.018 --> 35:45.724
and one of you will be erased.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.551
Maybe by sending you back
I can stop you

35:47.646 --> 35:49.022
from coming
in the first place

35:49.106 --> 35:50.937
and this you
ceases to exist.

35:52.693 --> 35:54.649
I don't know,
it's complicated.

35:56.238 --> 35:58.103
It's a leap of faith.

35:59.033 --> 36:00.398
It is.

36:00.701 --> 36:02.237
(CLATTERING)

36:04.830 --> 36:06.445
The couplings are secure.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.492
Building up a charge now.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.081
Time coordinates are set.

36:13.589 --> 36:15.420
Your temporal matrix
seems stable.

36:18.302 --> 36:19.508
This is it.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.049
Alec, ljust wanna say...

36:23.140 --> 36:24.721
Don't bother, Kiera.
No, I do.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.548
He really means
don't bother.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.176
Nice to see you, Matthew.

36:32.775 --> 36:34.140
I'm sorry, Kiera.

36:35.069 --> 36:36.149
Alec?

36:36.612 --> 36:38.443
It was the only way
to get the device back.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.879
KIERA: Alec.

37:06.517 --> 37:07.973
What are you doing?

37:08.185 --> 37:09.971
I'm protecting my family.

37:11.021 --> 37:12.181
And our legacy.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.809
I don't understand.

37:15.109 --> 37:17.065
Myself, Alec, Jason.

37:18.070 --> 37:21.233
Time travel is just not
some technological
marvel, Kiera.

37:21.949 --> 37:23.439
It's the family business.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.659
Who are you?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.035
A friend.

37:33.961 --> 37:35.917
I'm here to prevent you
from making a mistake.

37:37.548 --> 37:39.504
You have no idea what
I'm doing here, friend.

37:40.634 --> 37:41.999
In specific terms, no.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.878
But I swore an oath
to protect the world
from those

37:45.973 --> 37:47.929
who would abuse technology
to pervert and exploit

37:48.016 --> 37:50.007
the past, the present
and the future.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.509
Alec, he is not family.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.060
He is a threat.

37:54.148 --> 37:56.104
You don't get it, Kiera.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.601
He's my father!

38:03.365 --> 38:04.866
What's she doing here?

38:06.201 --> 38:08.192
It was just fine
until you showed up.

38:08.829 --> 38:09.864
There was no one
after him,

38:09.955 --> 38:11.820
there was no gun
to his head.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.746
I protected him!

38:14.042 --> 38:15.703
You exploited him.

38:16.003 --> 38:17.709
And you exposed him.

38:18.088 --> 38:20.044
And now I know
my son is not safe,

38:20.883 --> 38:22.373
unless he's by my side.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.757
MAN: Sentenced to death...

38:29.433 --> 38:30.593
(INAUDIBLE)

38:36.732 --> 38:38.063
Stay where you are.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.640
Hello, Warren.

38:40.903 --> 38:42.894
All these years I thought
you were dead, Sadler.

38:44.364 --> 38:45.740
Make any sudden moves
and you will be.

38:47.201 --> 38:48.691
Step away from the device.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.782
You want to protect
the time line?

38:57.628 --> 38:59.084
Send me home.

38:59.588 --> 39:02.000
I can prevent Liber8
from ever coming to 2077.

39:02.090 --> 39:04.046
I can make sure
none of this ever happens!

39:05.594 --> 39:06.629
(BEEPS)

39:06.720 --> 39:08.335
I can make things right.

39:08.430 --> 39:09.670
And then lwill destroy
the device,

39:09.765 --> 39:11.596
and nobody will
ever use it again.

39:13.936 --> 39:15.767
That's all I've ever wanted.

39:16.063 --> 39:18.019
To put the pieces
back together,

39:18.232 --> 39:20.143
and return to my family!

39:20.442 --> 39:21.978
That might be true...

39:22.861 --> 39:24.772
But there will
still be an anomaly.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.236
A glitch in the continuum.

39:30.702 --> 39:31.737
You.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.612
I'm prepared to die
for what I believe in.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.947
I don't think you are.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.957
I say we roll the dice.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.662
MAN: Prisoners,
take your positions
on the table.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.455
What the hell?

40:07.698 --> 40:08.733
KIERA: Alec...

40:08.824 --> 40:10.360
I can go home!

40:10.617 --> 40:12.482
I know, but I have
to save her.

40:12.619 --> 40:13.608
Alec, no!

40:14.037 --> 40:15.652
No, Alec, no!
No!

40:22.713 --> 40:24.624
(KIERA SOBS)

40:26.633 --> 40:27.622
Damn.

40:37.769 --> 40:38.975
(GRUNTING)

41:39.998 --> 41:40.987
(WHISPERS)
Where am I?

42:34.010 --> 42:35.591
What about Lucas?

42:35.679 --> 42:37.294
It's being arranged.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.631
The damage has passed.

42:41.476 --> 42:42.807
Except for Sadler.

42:45.981 --> 42:47.937
He's no longer our concern.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.977
In this time line.

42:51.445 --> 42:52.685
KIERA: I killed you...

42:52.779 --> 42:54.986
I killed you...
You're dead.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.239
I killed you...

WOMAN: Let me out of here!

43:03.999 --> 43:07.287
Curtis, behind you!
I gotta get out of here!

43:08.211 --> 43:09.667
God damn it!

43:09.880 --> 43:12.292
WOMAN: Why can't somebody
help me?

43:12.924 --> 43:15.256
Curtis, I wanna go home!

43:16.344 --> 43:17.550
Let me out of here!
