00:56.389 --> 00:58.224

00:58.308 --> 01:00.310

Sebastian's strong suit,

so if there's one thing
he shouldn't drop the ball on,

01:02.729 --> 01:03.646
it should be this.

You're talking
about executing precision.

01:04.938 --> 01:07.275

04:44.283 --> 04:46.286
They are focused,
disciplined, motivated,

04:46.369 --> 04:49.706

04:49.789 --> 04:51.541

{\an8}These guys are huge.
I mean, monstrous.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.303
There's no doubt in my mind
that it's gonna be a tough one.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.225
Welcome, guys.
Thanks for joining us.

05:09.308 --> 05:11.561
{\an8}First up, meet Charlie Johnson,
super bowl champion,

05:11.644 --> 05:15.398
<i>and he plays offensive guard</i>
<i>for the Minnesota Vikings.</i>

05:15.481 --> 05:17.984

05:18.067 --> 05:20.486
<i>and plays special team</i>
<i>for the Buffalo Bills.</i>

05:20.570 --> 05:21.988

<i>He played defense for a decade</i>
<i>on the Jaguars and The Bills.</i>

05:26.534 --> 05:28.202
{\an8}-King Mo.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.202
{\an8}-King Mo.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.382
[Dave] Artists, unlike
other elimination tattoos,

05:41.466 --> 05:45.636
this time, the power
is not in your hands.

05:45.720 --> 05:50.099
{\an8}For this tattoo, the power is
in the hands of the athletes.

05:50.808 --> 05:51.726
{\an8}What in the world?

05:51.809 --> 05:54.145
[Dave] You will have
a ten-minute interview

05:54.228 --> 05:56.105
with each of the athletes
individually.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.608
Then, the athletes
will choose skulls

05:58.691 --> 05:59.484
to determine
a picking order,

05:59.567 --> 06:02.779
and each athlete
will pick their artist.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.114
<i>The athletes</i>
<i>are picking the artists?</i>

06:05.198 --> 06:07.116
{\an8}Uh, this is different.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.786
{\an8}<i>Let everybody pick</i>
<i>who they're comfortable with,</i>

06:09.869 --> 06:11.204
{\an8}and let the best man win.

06:11.287 --> 06:13.581
Hopefully,
you can impress them.

06:13.664 --> 06:14.916
Head to your interviews.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.462
Hi, King mother[bleep] Mo.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.422
{\an8}Get the [bleep] out of here,
alright.

06:21.506 --> 06:22.673
<i>King Mo is the darkest,</i>

06:22.757 --> 06:25.176
{\an8}but he's the one
I actually want to tattoo

06:25.259 --> 06:26.552
{\an8}because it's King Mo.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.012
{\an8}<i>I'm royalty,</i>
<i>so if they screw up on me,</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:30.139
{\an8}I'm gonna mark 'em

06:30.223 --> 06:31.474
{\an8}with these four [bleep] knuckles
across their eye.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.433
What you looking for?

06:32.517 --> 06:33.559
A mixture of good and evil
together.

06:33.643 --> 06:37.480
Like having a [bleep] angel,
have her, like, kneeling

06:37.563 --> 06:39.690
but have her standing
in the demon's hand.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.526
Yeah, yeah,
I dig that.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.653
I'd like to get,
like, a phoenix.

06:43.736 --> 06:44.821
I have done phoenixes.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.615
I did a phoenix that went
just all the way from here.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.659
{\an5}-It had the wings open this way.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.659
-Okay.

06:49.742 --> 06:50.827
And I'd like colors.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.453
{\an8}Color is just always
a little bit more impressive.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.831
I'm really good at black
and grey or color,

06:54.914 --> 06:55.957

07:01.629 --> 07:02.505
-How are you doing, man?

07:02.588 --> 07:03.840
Good, man, good.
Have a seat.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.508

07:07.176 --> 07:08.636
-Nice to meet you.

07:08.719 --> 07:09.762
So tell me a little bit
about what you wanted to get.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.181
{\an3}I'm thinking of something
along, like, a phoenix.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.141
Basically
what I'm thinking is,

07:13.224 --> 07:14.559
like, embers
kind of smoldering,

07:14.642 --> 07:17.019
like, ashes igniting into,
like, a flame,

07:17.103 --> 07:18.020
turning into the phoenix.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.438
{\an8}I really want Scott.

07:19.522 --> 07:22.692
<i>if I'm able to take this phoenix</i>
<i>and really push the boundaries,</i>

07:22.775 --> 07:23.276
I could knock this one
out of the park.

07:23.359 --> 07:25.111
Where are you from?

07:25.194 --> 07:25.945
I'm from Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.572
{\an5}-Shut the "f" up.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.572
-No, really.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.365
{\an5}-That's where I'm from.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.365
-Pittsburgh?

07:29.448 --> 07:30.366
{\an5}-Yes.

07:29.448 --> 07:30.366
-No way!

07:30.449 --> 07:31.784
{\an5}-Wow. Small, small world.

07:30.449 --> 07:31.784
-This is--

07:31.868 --> 07:33.119
This is pretty nuts, yeah.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.036
Yeah.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.413
I would suggest
lighter areas, obviously.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.583
You ain't got a lot of room.
[laughs]

07:38.666 --> 07:40.459
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>the dark canvases.</i>

07:40.543 --> 07:42.628
{\an8}They take away
half your skill sets.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.713
I'm definitely dark, so--

07:43.796 --> 07:45.631
Right.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.008
<i>My stuff is dark and creepy.</i>

07:47.091 --> 07:48.759
<i>I don't want to go</i>
<i>that dark on dark skin.</i>

07:48.843 --> 07:49.760
This is not
the canvas for me.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.929
This has got to be
a $100 thousand tattoo,

07:52.013 --> 07:54.473
'cause whoever goes home on it
just lost 100 grand.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.558
What's your strength
as an artist?

07:55.641 --> 07:58.019
Anything that you
throw at me, I can draw.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.312
<i>With this challenge,</i>
<i>I want to prove</i>

08:01.814 --> 08:04.233
If that's not an <i> Ink Master</i> ,
then I don't know what is.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.903
I want a kick-ass dragon.

08:06.986 --> 08:07.862
Oh, that's really cool.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.780
Like, like, a kick-ass
Chinese dragon.

08:09.864 --> 08:10.823
I have done
a couple of dragons,

08:10.907 --> 08:13.409
and it sounds like
a really cool idea to me.

08:13.492 --> 08:14.577
{\an4}-Yeah.

08:13.492 --> 08:14.577
-To knock that out.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.495
<i>If I get this dragon</i>
<i>and I can pull it off,</i>

08:16.579 --> 08:18.497

08:20.082 --> 08:20.958
-Yep.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.793
What's going on, man?
how are you doing?

08:22.877 --> 08:24.086
{\an5}-Chilled out.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.086
-Nice to see you, man.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.296
{\an5}-Nice to meet you.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.296
-What's going on, bro?

08:25.379 --> 08:25.880
What's going on, man?
How are you doing?

08:25.963 --> 08:27.924
Marcus, man.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.133
Tell me a little bit.
What do you want to get?

08:29.217 --> 08:31.719
{\an5}-A Chinese dragon.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.719
-Okay.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.347
{\an8}I really don't want
to get a dragon.

08:34.429 --> 08:38.351
<i>With Chris Nunez being known</i>
<i>for his Japanese,</i>

08:38.433 --> 08:39.769
<i>no matter what you do,</i>

08:39.852 --> 08:41.270
<i>you're going to</i>
<i>get ripped apart.</i>

08:41.354 --> 08:42.813
If their idea
isn't feasible,

08:42.897 --> 08:44.774
I'm just going to have
to tell them,

08:44.857 --> 08:46.234
"This isn't going to work."

08:46.317 --> 08:48.778
What I'm thinking, more along
the lines of, is a foo dog.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.987
It's kind of like
the combination

08:50.071 --> 08:51.239
of a dog and a dragon.

08:51.322 --> 08:51.948
Oh, okay.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.991
Yeah.
They're really fierce.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.243
They look so [bleep] cool.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.121
For this tattoo, the power is
in the hands of the athletes.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.959
The athletes will choose skulls
to determine a picking order,

09:03.042 --> 09:05.169
and each athlete
will pick their artist.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.629
<i>I'm crossing</i>
<i>my goddamn fingers</i>

09:06.712 --> 09:08.673
{\an8}and my mother[bleep] toes
and my eyes.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.258
<i>I'm the last person</i>
<i>to pick.</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:12.468
I don't want to be stuck
with a scrub.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.844
Charlie,
you're up first.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.430
{\an8}[sighs]
I am very anxious.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.766
If I get the number one skull,
I'm gonna pick Sarah.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.143
[Dave] Number three.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.812
{\an8}Scott.

09:24.772 --> 09:25.690
Scott, number two.

09:25.773 --> 09:26.857
Yes.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.276
{\an8}Marcus, go ahead, man.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.570
{\an8}Number four, Marcus.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.489
{\an8}Yes! Yes!

09:33.572 --> 09:35.491
I knew it was gonna happen.
I knew it was gonna happen.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.201
[Dave] King, number one.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.452
[King] <i> I'm so excited.</i>
<i>Bam!</i>

09:38.536 --> 09:41.330
{\an8}Everybody else [bleep] up
and picked two, three, or four,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.165
{\an8}and I got stuck
with number one.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.043
Of course,
King Mo is number one.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.628
King Mo,
choose your artist.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.630
Sebastian, we're rolling
together, boy.

09:49.714 --> 09:50.673
We about to win.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.966
Scott,
you had number two.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.259
Go ahead
and pick an artist.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.385
From Pittsburgh.

09:54.468 --> 09:55.803
I'm gonna get tattooed
by someone from Pittsburgh.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.055
{\an5}-I'm gonna pick Sarah.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.055
-Alright, man.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.515
Number three
was Charlie.

09:59.598 --> 10:00.641
{\an8}I'm a little deflated.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.768
<i>Sarah was gonna be my pick.</i>

10:02.852 --> 10:03.978
I'm gonna pick Tatu Baby.

10:04.061 --> 10:07.189
With the excitement that
she shows about tattooing

10:07.273 --> 10:09.233
<i>and how she feels</i>
<i>about my design,</i>

10:09.317 --> 10:10.401
<i>I feel good about it.</i>

10:10.484 --> 10:12.737
And obviously, that means,
Marcus, you had number four.

10:12.820 --> 10:13.612
You're with Steve.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.032
{\an8}My number one choice
was Sebastian.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.241
<i>Steve's gonna have</i>
<i>to be on his A-game,</i>

10:17.325 --> 10:18.284
'cause I tackle 'em.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.744
Let's go make the money.

10:19.827 --> 10:23.164
<i>To not be picked before</i>
<i>the other three, [bleep] me.</i>

10:23.247 --> 10:25.374
{\an8}You know, I'm pissed.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.877
You have the rest of the evening
with your human canvas.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.295
Tomorrow,
you will have six hours

10:29.378 --> 10:31.714
to complete your tattoos.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.799
Based on your work,
one of you will be closing shop,

10:33.883 --> 10:37.845
and the other three will get
a ticket to the live finale.

10:37.928 --> 10:38.888
{\an1}Good luck.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.473
<i>We're at the top four.</i>

10:40.556 --> 10:41.932
{\an8}We should see an incredible
level of work here.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.226
<i>Three artists are gonna</i>
<i>go to the finale,</i>

10:44.310 --> 10:45.561
and one is going home.

10:45.644 --> 10:46.812
I want you to win.
You just run with me.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.857
When you see it,
you'll be like, "Holy [bleep]."

10:49.940 --> 10:53.569
I'm gonna go [bleep] balls
to the wall on this phoenix.

10:53.652 --> 10:54.820
When we win,
it'll be so much [bleep] sicker

10:54.904 --> 10:56.739
for two Pittsburgh people,
you know what I'm saying?

10:56.822 --> 10:58.449
{\an4}-Yeah.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.449
-I think we got it.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.076
{\an5}-Let's win this thing.

10:58.532 --> 11:00.076
-We're gonna win this.

11:00.159 --> 11:03.245
{\an1}A lot of times, dragons
come from smoke and wind.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.623
{\an8}I'm just having
a love-hate relationship

11:05.706 --> 11:07.541
{\an8}with this idea.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.461
<i>I want the challenge,</i>
<i>but at the same time,</i>

11:10.544 --> 11:13.047
<i>this is the most difficult</i>
<i>design to pull off</i>

11:13.130 --> 11:13.923
<i>out of all four.</i>

11:14.006 --> 11:15.091
I just hope
it doesn't hurt me.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.759
I'm sure
it's gonna kick ass.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.762
{\an8}Oh, man,
that's the spot.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.180
{\an8}What do you do
if somebody quit on you?

11:21.263 --> 11:22.431
{\an8}<i>I'm freaking out.</i>

11:22.515 --> 11:25.309
What did you tell this guy
to mislead him?

11:25.393 --> 11:27.269
How the [bleep]
did that happen?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.361
I feel like
I'm ready to go.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.697
I feel like we're
at the Olympics, you know,

11:37.780 --> 11:38.697
we're sprinting.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.033
Like, I'm excited.
Like, I want to compete.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.618
I feel great.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.453
<i>I feel</i>
<i>like the top is so close.</i>

11:44.537 --> 11:45.454
<i>I'm almost there,</i>

11:45.538 --> 11:47.581
but I'm not 100 percent
confident.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.417
[Steve] I feel like
I've already won.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.001
I don't care
what anybody else does

11:51.085 --> 11:52.670
'cause I can't control
what you guys do.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.880
{\an5}-Mm-hmm.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.880
-It's up to you.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.173
I'm gonna do
the best tattoo I can do,

11:56.257 --> 11:56.882
and if it's good enough,
I'm gonna win,

11:56.966 --> 11:59.009
and if it's not,
it's not.

12:02.346 --> 12:04.640
Artists, this is it.

12:04.723 --> 12:07.977
This tattoo
will ultimately determine

12:08.060 --> 12:11.021
which three of you will be
headed to the live finale

12:11.105 --> 12:13.774
and who's headed home.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.860
Remember,
you're gonna be judged

12:15.943 --> 12:17.361
on all
of the essential skills.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.405
You have six hours
to tattoo,

12:19.488 --> 12:23.659
and your time starts...

12:23.742 --> 12:23.909
...now.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.872
{\an5}-Bang.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.872
-Let's do it.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.331
<i>For this elimination tattoo,</i>

12:29.415 --> 12:31.709
{\an8}I want to see everything from
the fundamentals of line work

12:31.792 --> 12:35.171
{\an8}and shading and color to being
able to create dimension.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.465
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>The stakes are higher than ever.</i>

12:37.548 --> 12:40.217
Which three of these people
will be in the finale?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.136
{\an5}-You nervous?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.136
-Yeah.

12:42.219 --> 12:45.181
Six hours of pain,
scratch of the needle.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.765
I can't deal
with that, man.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.142
There's probably gonna be
a lot less pain

12:48.225 --> 12:49.393
than you felt in your life,
I can tell you that [bleep].

12:49.477 --> 12:50.936
{\an8}I'm real nervous
about the pain

12:51.020 --> 12:51.854
{\an8}'cause I don't know
what it's gonna feel like

12:51.937 --> 12:54.523
<i>when that needle</i>
<i>hits my thigh.</i>

12:54.607 --> 12:56.484
And it starts!

12:56.567 --> 12:58.861
[machine whirring]

12:58.944 --> 13:00.821
[Steve] <i> I put the stencil</i>
<i>on Marcus,</i>

13:00.905 --> 13:02.114
<i>and I realize</i>
<i>his back is so big,</i>

13:02.198 --> 13:06.160
<i>it actually eats the bottom</i>
<i>of the tattoo right up.</i>

13:06.243 --> 13:07.077
{\an8}I got to go bigger.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.539
<i>I'm feeling</i>
<i>a lot of pressure.</i>

13:10.623 --> 13:11.707
<i>The clock's started.</i>

13:11.790 --> 13:13.292
I'm worried that we're not gonna
get through this thing.

13:13.375 --> 13:13.959
I'm gonna need
every minute I can get.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.131
Alright, don't move.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.382
[whirring]

13:20.466 --> 13:23.469
Damn, that hurt.
[screams]

13:24.178 --> 13:26.514
[grunts]
Whoa! Ow, ow, ow!

13:26.597 --> 13:28.098
God damn, that [bleep] hurt,
for some reason.

13:28.182 --> 13:31.644
{\an8}There is a valid reason
to why King Mo was freaking out

13:31.727 --> 13:33.270
{\an8}about the pain on his leg.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.856
<i>His muscle is so dense</i>

13:35.940 --> 13:38.901
that it's harder for the needle
to push the ink.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.070
Being that his skin
already is so tight,

13:41.153 --> 13:44.323
<i>it's pulling even tighter,</i>
<i>so it starts to feel</i>

13:44.406 --> 13:46.450
like you're cutting a person,
opposed to tattooing 'em.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.412
Oh, man!
That [bleep] whacked up.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.247
It's bad.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.414
And I've got
six more hours of this?

13:52.498 --> 13:56.001
{\an5}-I'm screwed.

13:52.498 --> 13:56.001
-No!

13:56.085 --> 13:57.795
Five hours, everybody.
Five more hours.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.839
Hey, Mo, you only
got five hours, baby.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.883
[gasps]

14:02.967 --> 14:06.095
I am so close to making it
to the top three.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.304
Racing against the clock,

14:07.388 --> 14:10.057
trying to make sure
that you get everything done.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.518
That gold medal
is right in front of me,

14:12.601 --> 14:15.563
and god damn,
am I going for the gold.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.940
Let's go!

14:18.941 --> 14:20.025
[groans]

14:20.109 --> 14:21.443
You alive, King Mo?

14:21.527 --> 14:24.697
Ugh.
Damn, I'm sweating. Whew!

14:24.780 --> 14:25.739
Man, he's struggling
over there.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.409
{\an8}He's doing
a fairly piss-poor job,

14:28.492 --> 14:29.618
{\an8}handling the pain.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.536
You're King Mo!

14:30.619 --> 14:31.704
I'm being real, dog.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.830
{\an3}Mount up!

14:32.913 --> 14:35.249
I have to make sure
that I can finish this tattoo.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.085
What do you do
if somebody quit on you?

14:38.168 --> 14:39.962
<i>There is</i>
<i>so much pressure.</i>

14:40.045 --> 14:42.715
{\an8}These judges have just
such high standards.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.426
I feel like I'm overthinking
this dragon a lot.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.595
Let's see what baby's up to
in here.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.805
Let's get a little peek
at that face.

14:49.888 --> 14:52.474
<i>They come in,</i>
<i>and they absolutely say nothing.</i>

14:56.395 --> 14:56.895
{\an8}I'm starting
to get worried.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.985
{\an7}I have become a fan
of Tatu Baby's drive.

15:03.068 --> 15:04.320
<i>I love the fact</i>
<i>that she's trying to show</i>

15:04.403 --> 15:08.115
<i>that she can do whatever it is</i>
<i>that we're looking for,</i>

15:08.198 --> 15:12.953
but what a poor selection
for her to end up with today.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.955
<i>This is not looking strong.</i>

15:15.039 --> 15:17.249
Three hours down,
three hours remain.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.835
[groans]

15:19.918 --> 15:21.128
How you feeling, Marcus?

15:22.880 --> 15:23.714
This be tough, man.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.341
I think
I'm getting old and soft.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.342
Need a break,
let me know.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.886
{\an5}-Are we good? We good?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.886
-Ready to rock.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.513
<i>Steve is my man.</i>
<i>We were meant to work together.</i>

15:31.597 --> 15:35.059
{\an8}Team Steve.
I'm the captain of team Steve.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.101
{\an8}I'm on my A-game
with this tattoo.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.521
<i>I got dimension,</i>
<i>I got black and grey,</i>

15:39.605 --> 15:41.732
<i>it's big, it's clean,</i>
<i>it's mean-looking.</i>

15:41.815 --> 15:43.108
I'm pretty confident that

15:43.192 --> 15:43.942
I'm definitely going
to the finale.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.782
{\an5}-Oh!

15:47.988 --> 15:49.782
-Ow!

15:51.283 --> 15:53.369
{\an8}I feel like I did luck out,
getting Scott.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.079
<i>He's sitting for me</i>
<i>very well.</i>

15:55.162 --> 15:56.789
<i>I really do not understand</i>

15:56.872 --> 15:59.917
why Tatu Baby decided
to do this dragon.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.127

with dark skin,

19:40.012 --> 19:40.762
you did a great job.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.097
The amount of detail

It's exactly the right amount
of the use of dark,

well done tattoo, technically.

<i>I'm gonna get my ass chewed,</i>
<i>and it could take me home.</i>

21:28.453 --> 21:29.371
This was a big dice roll,
because to me,

21:29.454 --> 21:31.957
you did it in the spirit
of competition, like,

21:32.040 --> 21:33.625
"I'm gonna show these guys
that I can do this thing,"

21:33.709 --> 21:34.626

21:34.710 --> 21:38.088
However,
today is a tough day to gamble.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.132
You're missing
a lot of key elements.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.280
Well, I'm--

22:03.363 --> 22:05.991
{\an1}What I'm asking you is,
what did you tell this guy

22:06.074 --> 22:07.200
to mislead him
into thinking,

22:07.284 --> 22:09.953
"Pick me,
I'll do a good dragon"?

22:10.037 --> 22:10.912
I mean, I thought that

22:24.843 --> 22:26.762
If you sold him on the fact
that "I can do a dragon,"

22:26.845 --> 22:27.346

the wrong thing.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.476

22:36.855 --> 22:37.773
-Yes

22:37.856 --> 22:39.232

22:39.316 --> 22:40.317
[Sarah] <i> Basically, kind of bo.</i>

22:40.400 --> 22:41.902

22:41.985 --> 22:44.112
The cave is a symbol that
he wanted to be incorporated

22:44.196 --> 22:46.531
because it
symbolizes death.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.200
I think you did

22:58.460 --> 23:00.796
The wings on this thing

<i>had you have done</i>
<i>the tattoo like that,</i>

23:07.427 --> 23:10.013
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

23:10.097 --> 23:12.974

23:14.142 --> 23:15.435

It doesn't have those feathers
or that flame-y look.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.191
I thought I articulated
a really good piece.

23:21.274 --> 23:24.027
<i>There's not a strict contrast</i>
<i>between the cave and the fire.</i>

23:24.111 --> 23:26.154
It was a style choice.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.448
This fire should be glowing.
it should be bright.

23:28.532 --> 23:31.910

<i>stand apart from the dark cave.</i>

23:31.993 --> 23:32.786

32:34.619 --> 32:35.787
{\an1}I really hope that,
for the final canvas,

32:35.870 --> 32:38.790
you guys really,
really run with it,

32:38.873 --> 32:39.832
sprint with it.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.042
Two of you are gonna go home
with nothing,

32:41.125 --> 32:43.961
so whatever you do
on that final canvas, man,

32:44.045 --> 32:47.340
own it, and do the best tattoo
you've ever done in your life.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.343
Head back to the loft,
you three.

32:55.181 --> 32:57.558
And then
there were three.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.061
And there's nobody here
to say hi to us.

33:00.144 --> 33:02.980
{\an5}-[sighs]

33:00.144 --> 33:02.980
-Holy [bleep], man.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.315
Baby.

33:04.399 --> 33:04.857
I did not expect her
to drop that ball.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.734
With the dragon--

33:06.818 --> 33:07.902
When I saw the size
she was doing that dragon,

33:07.985 --> 33:09.153
I was like, "I'm done."

33:09.237 --> 33:09.987
I was like, "There is no way
I'm gonna compete with her."

33:10.071 --> 33:11.531
If her linework is
clean as hell,

33:11.614 --> 33:13.408
it's gonna be over.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.617
Mm-hmm.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.077
Keep doing [bleep] lines
they don't like,

33:16.160 --> 33:17.120
you're gonna go home.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.247
You can't present to America
an <i> Ink Master</i>

33:19.330 --> 33:21.124
if you can't at least
do the fundamentals.

33:21.207 --> 33:24.919
That's the one thing
that I know I do very well,

33:25.002 --> 33:26.295
and that's the fundamentals,

33:26.379 --> 33:29.090
a clean line, shading,
and solid color.

33:29.173 --> 33:32.260
I'm a very intricate,
technical tattoo artist.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.387
I just get edged out
by who's on the top.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.139
Bro, you're gonna go middle
of the road on this one too.

33:36.222 --> 33:39.100
He's never won a challenge,
and yet he's still here.

33:39.183 --> 33:42.478
I believe me and Sarah
are probably "A."

33:42.562 --> 33:44.439
Sebastian's a "C."

33:44.522 --> 33:46.691
I'm just gonna keep y'all
going against each other,

33:46.774 --> 33:48.192
so I can just
keep sneaking past.

33:48.276 --> 33:51.279
While y'all are still arguing,
I have $100 thousand.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.072
There's only one more time,
though, remember that.

33:53.156 --> 33:53.781
{\an5}-One more time.

33:53.156 --> 33:53.781
-Yeah.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.284
That's all there is to it.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.956
{\an8}There is
one last surprise.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.875
{\an8}Oh, [bleep].

34:03.958 --> 34:05.585
{\an8}What the [bleep] going on?

34:12.300 --> 34:15.178
{\an1}I really don't know
what's coming up next.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.304
It's going to be--

34:16.387 --> 34:18.139
Something extremely difficult,
I can guarantee it.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.098
It's gonna be difficult.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.141
I think the difference is now,
though,

34:20.224 --> 34:21.391
this is a $100 thousand tatto.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.976
This is the most pressure
I've felt

34:23.060 --> 34:26.105
since the beginning
of the competition.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.150
And I think this is bigger
than even we realize.

34:34.405 --> 34:38.076
I have one real person
that really pushed my art,

34:38.159 --> 34:40.203
pushed my creativity.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.038
It's my brother-in-law,

34:42.121 --> 34:45.166
and, well, he died,
like, a week or so

34:45.248 --> 34:48.085
before I went
to my very first convention

34:48.920 --> 34:50.087
and won my first trophy.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.672
The [bleep] that I've been
doing on here, man,

34:54.091 --> 34:55.592
he would be so happy.

34:55.676 --> 34:57.136
{\an8}Sebastian's definitely
feeling the pressure,

34:57.220 --> 34:59.514
<i>and I think</i>
<i>even he's a little amazed</i>

34:59.597 --> 35:00.681
that he's made it this far.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.225
Are you guys
ready to do this?

35:02.308 --> 35:06.312
It's been an honor
to have tattooed with you both.

35:06.395 --> 35:07.647
Absolutely.

35:07.730 --> 35:08.940
Unfortunately, I'm the only one
going back $100 thousand richer,

35:09.023 --> 35:12.109
but, you know,
I'll think of you guys.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.569
[laughs]

35:28.626 --> 35:31.754
Congratulations.
You are the final three.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.339
[exhales]

35:33.422 --> 35:35.633
For weeks, you've put it all
on the line.

35:35.716 --> 35:38.386
You've endured
grueling tattoo sessions

35:38.469 --> 35:39.846
and harsh critiques,

35:39.929 --> 35:42.306
and you've all produced
some impressive work,

35:42.390 --> 35:44.392
but only one of you
will walk away

35:44.475 --> 35:45.893
with $100 thousand,

35:45.977 --> 35:49.480
a feature in <i> Inked</i> <i>Magazine</i> ,
and the title of <i> Ink Master</i> .

35:49.564 --> 35:50.898
It all comes down to this.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.692
<i>I'm here to win.</i>

35:52.775 --> 35:54.068
That's the only reason
why I'm here.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.987
I'm the best.
I'm gonna prove it.

35:56.070 --> 35:57.238
For your final tattoo,

35:57.321 --> 36:00.074
you will each be assigned
a master canvas.

36:00.157 --> 36:03.077
What you tattoo
and where you tattoo

36:03.161 --> 36:04.036
is completely up to you.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.331
{\an5}-[bleep] yeah.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.331
-Alright, alright.

36:07.415 --> 36:08.749
Alright.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.751
{\an8}<i>This is what I've been waiting</i>
<i>for the entire competition.</i>

36:10.835 --> 36:13.462
<i>I have a ton of ideas</i>
<i>in my head right now.</i>

36:13.546 --> 36:15.673
This is do or die.

36:15.756 --> 36:19.010
This is your chance to tattoo
exactly what you want.

36:19.093 --> 36:20.011
[laughs]
Holy [bleep]!

36:20.094 --> 36:22.763
That's the [bleep], man,
[bleep].

36:22.847 --> 36:24.849
You guys want to meet
these canvases?

36:24.932 --> 36:26.267
{\an5}-Yeah.

36:24.932 --> 36:26.267
-Let's do it.

36:33.482 --> 36:34.734
Steve, meet Bernie.

36:34.817 --> 36:36.319
{\an5}-How you doing?

36:34.817 --> 36:36.319
-How you doing?

36:36.402 --> 36:38.154
Sarah, this is
your master canvas, Dave.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.572
{\an5}-Hello.

36:38.237 --> 36:39.572
-Hey.

36:39.655 --> 36:41.115
Sebastian, meet Alicia.

36:41.199 --> 36:41.616
{\an5}-Hi.

36:41.199 --> 36:41.616
-Hi.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.701
These canvases

36:43.784 --> 36:45.244
are putting their bodies
on the line for you.

36:45.328 --> 36:48.456
Their appearance
will be transformed forever.

36:48.539 --> 36:52.460
This tattoo stands
between you and $100 thousand.

36:52.543 --> 36:53.628
[laughs]

36:53.711 --> 36:56.464
Although,
there is one last surprise.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.883
Oh, [bleep].

36:58.966 --> 37:01.510
It's time for all of you
to pack your bags

37:01.594 --> 37:02.803
and leave New York...

37:02.887 --> 37:04.263
Oh.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.806
For now.

37:05.890 --> 37:10.228
You're returning home
to complete a 24-hour tattoo.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.230
{\an5}-What?

37:10.311 --> 37:12.230
-A [bleep] 24-hour tattoo?

37:12.313 --> 37:15.775
[Dave] You will have
four six-hour sessions

37:15.858 --> 37:16.943
over the next several months

37:17.026 --> 37:20.321
with your master canvas
to create your masterpiece.

37:20.404 --> 37:22.698
Then, you will return
to New York City

37:22.782 --> 37:24.992
and reveal
your master canvas

37:25.076 --> 37:28.037
live to the judges
and all of America.

37:28.120 --> 37:33.000
I have 24 hours to make
a great tattoo my way, my style.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.418
<i>This is it.</i>

37:34.502 --> 37:36.003
This is a $100 thousand tattoo,

37:36.087 --> 37:38.130
and it better be [bleep]
perfect.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.424
Time for you to prove
what you're made of.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.801
There's no excuses.

37:41.884 --> 37:43.177
This is your time
to shine,

37:43.260 --> 37:44.804
so you better stand up
for what's yours

37:44.887 --> 37:46.681
'cause you're
about to get called out.

37:46.764 --> 37:47.598
This is a prize in itself.

37:47.682 --> 37:48.975
Everything you've done
to get this far

37:49.058 --> 37:51.185
don't mean [bleep] anymore.

37:51.268 --> 37:53.479
This last tattoo
has got to be everything.

37:53.562 --> 37:56.524
Put your heart into it.
Good luck, everybody.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.943
Alright, artists, you have
the rest of the evening

37:59.026 --> 37:59.819
to consult
with your master canvases.

37:59.902 --> 38:02.029
Then, in two weeks,

38:02.113 --> 38:04.031
you'll meet your master canvas
in your hometown

38:04.115 --> 38:06.826
for the first
of four six-hour sittings.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.536
And don't forget,
throughout the season,

38:08.619 --> 38:09.787
you have been judged
by all of America,

38:09.870 --> 38:12.164
and at the live finale,

38:12.248 --> 38:14.417
America's votes
will play a huge role

38:14.500 --> 38:16.794
in determining
the next <i> Ink Master</i> .

38:16.877 --> 38:19.463
So travel safe,
and good luck.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.883
<i>The big difference</i>
<i>about this 24-hour canvas is,</i>

38:22.967 --> 38:26.053
{\an8}we want to give these artists
a chance to not feel rushed.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.054
We want to give these artists
a chance to go home,

38:27.138 --> 38:28.306
work in their own environment,

38:28.389 --> 38:30.808
and really pull
the best out of them.

38:30.891 --> 38:32.101
This is their time to look back
at where they were weak

38:32.184 --> 38:34.729
and really work
on those weaknesses.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.939
Hopefully, they understand
what they need to show us.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.984
{\an5}-I have some ideas.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.984
-Okay.

38:40.067 --> 38:44.447
I have an open canvas
to do whatever I want.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.906
{\an5}-I want to hit everything here.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.906
-Okay.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.284
I want to hit texture, color,
design, [bleep] everything.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.911
{\an5}-Everything. Go for it, yeah.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.911
-Everything.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.915
I have to really do something
so spectacular, so impressive,

38:54.999 --> 38:58.294
the judges will have no choice
but to say that I win.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.713
{\an5}-You're in good hands.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.713
-Yes, I knew.

39:00.796 --> 39:02.548
I've beat out
a lot of people to get here.

39:02.631 --> 39:06.427
Yeah, I know.
[laughter]

39:06.510 --> 39:09.680
I'm gonna do some
really crazy, evil [bleep].

39:09.764 --> 39:11.891
<i>I want this thing to be</i>
<i>disgusting, dark, creepy.</i>

39:11.974 --> 39:14.185
<i>I want you to be</i>
<i>afraid of it.</i>

39:14.268 --> 39:15.686
This is gonna be the best one
I've ever done.

39:15.770 --> 39:16.479
This is gonna be the one.

39:16.562 --> 39:18.481
I get to do
what I want to do,

39:18.564 --> 39:19.315
so there's absolutely
no excuse

39:19.398 --> 39:21.650
not to make this
the best tattoo.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.277
{\an5}-I'm here for you to win.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.277
-Cool, man.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.530
I mean,
this is a $100 thousand tattoo,

39:26.614 --> 39:27.823
you know what I mean?

39:27.907 --> 39:29.283
Four [bleep]
six-hour sessions,

39:29.366 --> 39:31.702
I can do a [bleep] back piece,
damn near.

39:31.786 --> 39:32.995
Well,
I have no clue of what--

39:33.079 --> 39:34.622
I mean, it's not like
I have an idea of what I want,

39:34.705 --> 39:39.210
um, but I danced for quite
a few years, like, ballet.

39:39.293 --> 39:40.503
I don't know
if you can incorporate--

39:40.586 --> 39:43.464
Well, that ain't got [bleep]
to do with me, honestly.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.966
{\an8}I'm not gonna do
any frilly [bleep] design.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.468
{\an8}I'm not gonna do
all types of swoops

39:47.551 --> 39:48.803
{\an8}and bull[bleep] like that.

39:48.886 --> 39:53.057
I'm going to cover an area doing
some crazy type of [bleep].

39:53.140 --> 39:54.850
{\an8}<i>It makes me</i>
<i>very nervous</i>

39:54.934 --> 39:57.144
{\an8}to not know what is going
to go on my body.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.773
I don't know if it will be
more masculine than feminine.

40:00.856 --> 40:02.149
<i>It is scary.</i>

40:02.233 --> 40:04.443
I am putting my whole back
in Sebastian's hands.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.823
{\an8}To let someone
that you've never met

40:08.906 --> 40:11.117
{\an8}put an image on you,
you don't know what it is,

40:11.200 --> 40:14.036
{\an8}for that long and that big,
that's insane.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.288
I love them for this.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.957
Without those three canvases,

40:18.040 --> 40:19.959
there'd be no 100 grand
to give away.

40:22.044 --> 40:24.338
Good enough does not exist
in my [bleep] world.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.506
I know
I can beat these people.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.007
I can win this.

40:27.091 --> 40:29.885
[rock music]

40:29.969 --> 40:31.178
