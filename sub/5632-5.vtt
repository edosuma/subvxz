00:21.506 --> 00:22.972
No, look,
just tell all the dudes

00:23.008 --> 00:25.975
that Rachel will be here,
dressed as a sexy nurse.

00:26.011 --> 00:27.844
Because, look,
if Rachel shows up,

00:27.879 --> 00:29.646
all the guys will show up.
If all the guys show up

00:29.681 --> 00:32.348
all the girls show up--
it's simple math.

00:35.087 --> 00:37.087
Dude...

00:37.122 --> 00:39.022
seriously, is this where you
think the keg should go?

00:39.057 --> 00:41.124
I mean, where else
would I put it?

00:41.159 --> 00:43.393
You put it up top,
so it's hard to get to.

00:43.428 --> 00:44.794
Makes the beer
last longer.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.396
Yeah, but I saw a rat

00:46.431 --> 00:48.164
come out of the floor
over there, earlier.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.699
It's a Halloween party.

00:49.735 --> 00:52.168
Just think of the rats
as decoration, you know?

00:55.607 --> 00:57.073
See? It's perfect.

00:58.677 --> 00:59.843
(floorboards crack,
man screams, groans)

00:59.878 --> 01:01.344
(gasps)
Preston! Are you okay?

01:01.380 --> 01:03.813
(Preston grunting with effort)

01:07.686 --> 01:08.918
What?

01:09.788 --> 01:12.689
(both guys shrieking)

01:21.099 --> 01:22.699
Oh! Ow!

01:22.734 --> 01:25.268
Okay, we are not running
out of candy this year.

01:25.303 --> 01:27.604
I got about 15 pounds.

01:27.639 --> 01:28.705
BRENNAN:
Booth!

01:28.740 --> 01:30.240
You know how I feel
about candy!

01:30.275 --> 01:31.875
Do you know how bad it is

01:31.910 --> 01:33.543
for children's
endocrine systems?

01:33.578 --> 01:35.111
Come on! It's Halloween,
all bets are off.

01:35.147 --> 01:36.379
Besides, I mean, look at this

01:36.415 --> 01:37.981
as, uh,
an insurance policy, right?

01:38.016 --> 01:40.083
I mean, last year,
we ran out of candy,

01:40.118 --> 01:41.384
you started passing out raisins,

01:41.420 --> 01:43.052
and then we ended up getting
our house egged.

01:43.088 --> 01:44.988
Whoa! What is that?

01:45.023 --> 01:45.989
Is that a brain?

01:46.024 --> 01:47.857
I am making edible props

01:47.893 --> 01:49.292
for Christine's
Halloween party at school.

01:49.327 --> 01:52.529
Last year, Olivia's mom
brought plastic eyeballs,

01:52.564 --> 01:55.398
which were completely
unrealistic, so...

01:55.434 --> 01:57.133
I concocted some brains

01:57.169 --> 01:59.035
out of agar gelatin
and food dye.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.503
Oh, so that's, like, edible!

02:00.539 --> 02:02.505
Look at that,
it's like Jell-O! Mmm!

02:02.541 --> 02:04.541
Oh! Booth!
Huh?

02:04.576 --> 02:06.075
That was a model!
That's an actual brain

02:06.111 --> 02:07.610
I brought back from the lab!

02:08.613 --> 02:11.214
(retching):
Aah! Oh! God!

02:11.249 --> 02:13.116
Got ya.
(laughs)

02:13.151 --> 02:15.552
What do you mean, got me?

02:15.587 --> 02:16.953
I was pranking you.

02:16.988 --> 02:18.855
As is the tradition
for this time of year.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.490
Aha, right, okay.
So that's how it is.

02:20.525 --> 02:22.425
Yes, and you fell for it.

02:22.461 --> 02:23.960
You really believed
that was a brain?

02:23.995 --> 02:25.862
Ugh! Okay, all right.
This does not end here.

02:25.897 --> 02:28.298
(phone chirps)
Oh.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.467
Actually...

02:30.502 --> 02:32.669
I'm afraid it does.

02:32.704 --> 02:34.737
BOOTH: <i> Who throws a kegger</i>
<i>in a church?</i>

02:34.773 --> 02:36.272
<i>That's sacrilegious.</i>

02:36.308 --> 02:37.607
No, quite the opposite.

02:37.642 --> 02:39.609
All Hallow's Eve is a
religious festival

02:39.644 --> 02:40.610
that employs humor

02:40.645 --> 02:43.179
and ridicule to...

02:43.215 --> 02:44.714
confront the power of death.

02:44.749 --> 02:46.449
BOOTH: What about the body
under the floorboards?

02:46.485 --> 02:48.418
BRENNAN:
Murder is never humorous.

02:48.453 --> 02:51.821
Unlike my prank, which
was objectively hilarious.

02:51.857 --> 02:54.090
Okay, laugh it up there,
okay, squint girl, huh?

02:54.125 --> 02:56.092
Okay, so what
do we got here?

02:56.127 --> 02:59.262
Oh, I found no fluids
surrounding the corpse.

02:59.297 --> 03:00.430
So the body must've
exsanguinated

03:00.465 --> 03:02.499
before being brought here.

03:02.534 --> 03:04.067
"Sang-uin-ated." Okay.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.568
Any idea when?

03:05.604 --> 03:06.736
Well, these are <i> Staphylinidae.</i>

03:06.771 --> 03:08.371
They're punctual little fellas.

03:08.406 --> 03:10.073
Means the victim's been dead

03:10.108 --> 03:11.207
for two to three days.

03:11.243 --> 03:12.275
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

03:12.310 --> 03:14.210
What's with the demon eyes?

03:14.246 --> 03:15.545
Michael Vincent,
he flushed my lenses,

03:15.580 --> 03:18.314
so these are all I had.

03:18.350 --> 03:20.183
Right, I mean, of course you
have demon prescription lenses.

03:20.218 --> 03:22.285
Right?
You don't?

03:22.320 --> 03:24.521
Just change them up as soon
as you can, okay, Beelzebub?

03:24.556 --> 03:27.524
BRENNAN: The small mastoid processes
and the less-pronounced

03:27.559 --> 03:29.759
supraorbital ridge
indicate the victim was female.

03:29.794 --> 03:31.594
SAROYAN: And based on the elasticity
of the epidermis,

03:31.630 --> 03:33.196
she couldn't have been over 30.

03:33.231 --> 03:34.464
BOOTH:
What I want to know is why

03:34.499 --> 03:36.332
the killer dumped her
in this church.

03:36.368 --> 03:39.102
Well, the killing
could be ritualistic.

03:39.137 --> 03:40.470
You guys are gonna want
to look at this.

03:40.505 --> 03:42.138
BOOTH:
What do we have over here?

03:42.173 --> 03:44.007
HODGINS:
Check this out.

03:44.042 --> 03:45.441
Is this a door?

03:45.477 --> 03:46.876
BRENNAN:
Looks like a mortsafe.

03:46.912 --> 03:48.378
SAROYAN: What's that?

03:48.413 --> 03:51.214
A mortsafe was an iron coffin.

03:51.249 --> 03:52.715
They used it
in order to try

03:52.751 --> 03:54.117
and prevent grave-robbing.

03:54.152 --> 03:56.019
Does anyone know
what that symbol means?

03:56.054 --> 03:57.387
Could be initials.

03:57.422 --> 03:59.122
Possibly corresponding
to a family name.

03:59.157 --> 04:01.858
We'll need to bring this
to the lab for further analysis.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.893
SAROYAN: Someone
opened it recently.

04:03.929 --> 04:06.629
Okay, what do you say
we open that up there?

04:08.567 --> 04:11.534
BRENNAN:
Ooh!

04:11.570 --> 04:12.769
Oh!

04:12.804 --> 04:13.836
BRENNAN:
Judging from the style

04:13.872 --> 04:16.339
and condition
of the uniform,

04:16.374 --> 04:19.676
this body likely dates
from the 18th century.

04:19.711 --> 04:21.511
Judging from the movies I've
seen, this is a British Redcoat.

04:21.546 --> 04:23.413
BRENNAN:
Your methodology is imperfect,

04:23.448 --> 04:24.814
but I'm inclined to agree.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.215
SAROYAN:
And what happened to his head?

04:26.251 --> 04:28.251
HODGINS:
It's definitely not in here.

04:28.286 --> 04:29.752
BOOTH: One mystery at
a time, here, okay?

04:29.788 --> 04:31.421
My question is what do
these two bodies

04:31.456 --> 04:33.056
have to do with each other?

04:33.925 --> 04:34.925
HODGINS:
Whoa!

04:37.128 --> 04:38.761
Oops.

04:38.797 --> 04:40.964
Happy Halloween.

<i>I pulled the most amusing prank</i>

05:20.268 --> 05:21.434
on Booth this morning.

05:21.616 --> 05:22.634
<i>You</i> pulled a prank?

05:22.635 --> 05:24.101
Yes, and he fell for it.

05:24.136 --> 05:26.570
I convinced him that
a gelatinous brain mold

05:26.605 --> 05:29.573
I made for Christine's school
was an actual human brain

05:29.608 --> 05:31.542
after he'd taken a bite.

05:31.577 --> 05:34.945
Well, I would've
loved to see his face.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.948
Based on the subpubic angle,
this victim was male.

05:37.983 --> 05:40.250
Length of femur indicates
he was close to six feet.

05:40.286 --> 05:42.619
Oh, that is unusual
for a man of his era.

05:42.655 --> 05:44.021
HODGINS:
His redcoat uniform

05:44.056 --> 05:45.923
is the real deal.

05:45.958 --> 05:48.025
It's made from genuine
wool broadcloth.

05:48.060 --> 05:50.327
Check out the warp and the weft.

05:50.362 --> 05:52.196
Two of my all-time
favorite words.

05:52.231 --> 05:53.597
Yeah, with good reason.

05:53.632 --> 05:55.065
They tell me that

05:55.100 --> 05:58.035
this fabric was made
on a preindustrial loom.

05:58.070 --> 06:00.304
BRENNAN: Deterioration
to the sternal rib ends

06:00.339 --> 06:02.005
indicate he was close to 50.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.608
I see no conclusive
cause of death.

06:04.643 --> 06:06.944
Other than having
his head cut off?

06:06.979 --> 06:10.113
Well, preliminary tox says
that there were significant

06:10.149 --> 06:13.150
traces of mercury and arsenic
on our headless victim.

06:13.185 --> 06:14.651
He was poisoned?

06:14.687 --> 06:15.986
Not necessarily.

06:16.021 --> 06:17.387
Both those substances
were commonly

06:17.423 --> 06:18.722
used for embalming.

06:18.757 --> 06:19.856
These remains are

06:19.892 --> 06:20.958
admittedly fascinating,

06:20.993 --> 06:22.326
but I must remind everyone

06:22.361 --> 06:23.627
that we are examining them

06:23.662 --> 06:25.028
in order to shed light

06:25.064 --> 06:27.931
on a more recent
set of remains.

06:27.967 --> 06:29.866
There's significant trauma

06:29.902 --> 06:33.503
to the sphenoid, nasal bones,
and both zygomatics.

06:33.539 --> 06:35.372
Looks like she paid a lot
of attention to her appearance.

06:35.407 --> 06:37.641
Pink belt, pink shoes.

06:37.676 --> 06:39.443
SAROYAN:
The nails are intact.

06:39.478 --> 06:40.711
The manicure is still perfect.

06:40.746 --> 06:42.045
Looks like a real junior miss.

06:42.081 --> 06:43.647
Which begs
the age-old question.

06:43.682 --> 06:46.383
What's a girl like her
doing with a guy like him?

06:59.231 --> 07:01.965
Hey, I did a facial
reconstruction of the victim,

07:02.001 --> 07:04.034
but the skull was so damaged,

07:04.069 --> 07:05.902
that I-I couldn't
find a match.

07:05.938 --> 07:08.205
Maybe it's 'cause we made
some incorrect assumptions.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.439
Oh...

07:09.475 --> 07:11.008
Is that an ear?

07:11.043 --> 07:12.776
An ear with a lot
of holes in it.

07:12.811 --> 07:14.678
I sent you the file.

07:14.713 --> 07:16.113
Oh.

07:16.148 --> 07:17.914
That's a lot of piercings

07:17.950 --> 07:20.217
for somebody who dressed
like Mary Sunshine.

07:20.252 --> 07:22.953
Exactly, and that's not the
only thing that doesn't fit.

07:22.988 --> 07:24.554
Pull up the next picture.

07:24.590 --> 07:26.957
Her hair

07:26.992 --> 07:28.825
was recently stripped
and then dyed blond,

07:28.861 --> 07:30.961
but you can still see some
of the magenta underneath.

07:30.996 --> 07:34.197
Okay, so magenta hair,
plus a bunch of piercings?

07:34.233 --> 07:36.533
Not exactly what we thought
we were looking for.

07:36.568 --> 07:38.168
Let me change
the hair color,

07:38.203 --> 07:40.704
and add some studs.

07:45.844 --> 07:49.346
SAROYAN:
Look at that.

07:49.381 --> 07:51.615
Sarah Lippman.

07:51.650 --> 07:53.784
26. She was a medical student.

07:53.819 --> 07:56.320
Reported missing yesterday.

08:06.265 --> 08:08.598
Tremendous loss
for the program.

08:08.634 --> 08:10.400
Sarah's gonna be
hard to replace.

08:10.436 --> 08:12.069
She was third-year,
and she was quite good.

08:12.104 --> 08:13.670
Right, a loss
to the program.

08:13.706 --> 08:15.105
It's tragic.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.074
Obviously, it was
a personal loss as well.

08:17.109 --> 08:18.775
Goes without saying.

08:18.811 --> 08:20.010
So, do you remember anything,

08:20.045 --> 08:21.111
uh, different
about her recently?

08:21.146 --> 08:22.512
In what way?

08:22.548 --> 08:23.847
Well, her appearance for one.

08:23.882 --> 08:25.415
She'd gotten rid
of her facial piercings.

08:25.451 --> 08:26.883
Changed her hair color.
Oh, that.

08:26.919 --> 08:28.452
I see that all the time

08:28.487 --> 08:30.354
when the residents are
applying for fellowships.

08:30.389 --> 08:31.955
If they want people
to call them Doctor,

08:31.990 --> 08:33.523
they'd better look the part.

08:33.558 --> 08:35.958
That's her boyfriend Joel Brown
or so I understand.

08:35.994 --> 08:37.094
We can go in there?
Yeah.

08:37.129 --> 08:38.462
Thanks.

08:38.496 --> 08:40.030
Okay, class,

08:40.065 --> 08:41.698
what do you say-- whoa!

08:41.734 --> 08:42.999
Great, a lot of bodies
here-- Joel Brown?

08:43.034 --> 08:44.101
Uh, do you mind?

08:44.135 --> 08:45.302
We're closing a patient.

08:45.337 --> 08:47.371
Lot of bodies here.
He can wait.

08:47.406 --> 08:49.973
BOOTH: What do you say we step
away from the cadaver there.

08:50.008 --> 08:52.008
We need to talk to you
about Sarah Lippman.

08:52.044 --> 08:53.677
Oh, God.

08:53.712 --> 08:56.413
Yeah, she was found, uh,
dead late last night.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.582
Oh, God,
I'm sorry, Joel.

08:58.617 --> 08:59.883
What can I do?

08:59.918 --> 09:01.184
You can give us a minute.

09:01.220 --> 09:02.419
We need to speak
with your friend.

09:02.454 --> 09:03.920
Let's step outside.
Come on.

09:03.956 --> 09:06.623
You continue...
with the bodies.

09:11.797 --> 09:14.865
When was the last time
you saw Sarah?

09:14.900 --> 09:16.867
A few days ago.

09:16.902 --> 09:20.404
Right, but you didn't you report
her missing till yesterday?

09:20.439 --> 09:22.639
Yeah, our schedules
right now are insane.

09:22.674 --> 09:24.708
Um, 48 on, 48 off.

09:24.743 --> 09:27.043
She wasn't answering
my calls but I,

09:27.079 --> 09:28.745
I thought she was just
catching up on some sleep,

09:28.781 --> 09:30.247
just like we all do.

09:30.282 --> 09:32.516
But then she didn't
show up for class.

09:32.551 --> 09:34.384
And you two were doing okay?

09:34.420 --> 09:36.553
We know that she'd just gone
through a big change recently.

09:36.588 --> 09:38.422
You mean her look, um...

09:38.457 --> 09:40.524
Yeah, I think I was finally
starting to rub off on her.

09:40.559 --> 09:42.692
What do you mean?

09:42.728 --> 09:44.895
People always thought
we were kind of an odd couple.

09:44.930 --> 09:47.030
Um, she was kind of dark.

09:47.065 --> 09:49.232
And I'm the good Catholic boy.

09:49.268 --> 09:51.368
But... it worked.

09:51.403 --> 09:53.870
So, you know of nothing
that would've led to this?

09:53.906 --> 09:55.005
Uh, nothing.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.506
And over the last few weeks,

09:56.542 --> 09:59.376
Sarah was happier
than she'd ever been.

10:08.987 --> 10:11.121
Take heed,
young Squintern.

10:11.156 --> 10:12.355
The bugs know best.

10:12.391 --> 10:14.224
Okay, I'll bite-- how?

10:14.259 --> 10:16.626
Well, I ran some threads
from our headless friend's

10:16.662 --> 10:18.628
uniform through
the mass spec.

10:18.664 --> 10:20.497
It turns out
that the dye came

10:20.532 --> 10:21.932
from Cochineal beetles.

10:21.967 --> 10:23.467
They had to crush
thousands of these guys

10:23.502 --> 10:25.836
in order to make enough dye
for a single coat.

10:25.871 --> 10:27.838
That sounds pretty
labor intensive.

10:27.873 --> 10:29.172
Yeah, it is,
and therefore, expensive.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.074
Which means that
this headless corpse

10:31.109 --> 10:33.443
was a high-ranking
British officer.

10:33.479 --> 10:36.813
Why was this one buried under a
church in the middle of nowhere?

10:42.488 --> 10:45.455
AUBREY: Okay, this is
Sarah Lippman's locker.

10:45.491 --> 10:48.091
We got, uh, change of clothes,
some textbooks--

10:48.126 --> 10:50.093
Whoa.
BOOTH: What?

10:50.128 --> 10:52.662
Wait a second.

10:52.698 --> 10:55.499
What is this--
a book of witchcraft?

10:55.534 --> 10:57.434
BOOTH:
Yeah.

10:57.469 --> 10:59.803
I recognize that symbol--
that was on the iron coffin.

10:59.838 --> 11:00.871
The mortsafe?

11:00.906 --> 11:03.106
That is not a coincidence.

11:06.979 --> 11:10.947
I now recognize this symbol
is the Nordic rune, Uruz.

11:10.983 --> 11:15.018
Its presence on both the coffin
and our victim's book

11:15.053 --> 11:16.586
suggests some sort of link.

11:16.622 --> 11:21.458
Exactly-- pagan symbols, a
headless corpse, Halloween?

11:21.493 --> 11:25.362
Is it just me, or is something
otherworldly going on here?

11:25.397 --> 11:27.664
WOMAN: That sounds
like our department.

11:30.035 --> 11:31.368
Who are you?

11:31.403 --> 11:33.103
And what are you doing
in my laboratory?

11:33.138 --> 11:34.604
Is there a cosplay
competition going on

11:34.640 --> 11:36.439
that I wasn't
invited to?

11:36.475 --> 11:39.209
Do I look as though I have just
beamed from the planet Vulcan?

11:39.244 --> 11:42.112
No, I wear these clothes
to honor the men

11:42.147 --> 11:44.147
who fought so this country
could be born.

11:44.182 --> 11:46.182
Mm-hmm, okay.

11:46.218 --> 11:48.952
Dude, I like it.

11:48.987 --> 11:51.354
I'm Agent Abbie Mills of the
Westchester field office FBI,

11:51.390 --> 11:52.322
and this is...

11:52.357 --> 11:54.257
My name is Ichabod Crane,

11:54.293 --> 11:56.826
of the Hudson Valley
Historical Society.

11:56.862 --> 11:59.162
We hear you have a headless
body on your hands.

11:59.197 --> 12:02.132
It may be connected with a
series of unsolved homicides.

12:02.167 --> 12:03.967
That body is
material evidence

12:04.002 --> 12:05.702
in our ongoing murder
investigation.

12:05.737 --> 12:07.170
It's not going anywhere.

12:07.205 --> 12:10.140
This is about solving a
case in Sleepy Hollow.

12:10.175 --> 12:12.676
We're not leaving
without those bones.

12:22.864 --> 12:23.785
So get a load of this.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.920
I've been going through the
Sleepy Hollow case files--

12:26.175 --> 12:28.943
dozens of missing persons,
multiple decapitations.

12:28.978 --> 12:30.444
Bastards even got the sheriff.

12:30.479 --> 12:32.813
I thought small town living
was supposed to be safe.

12:32.849 --> 12:35.216
So we gonna help 'em?
Well, you know, we kind of have to.

12:35.251 --> 12:36.884
Look, Bones is
not gonna like this.

12:36.919 --> 12:39.486
Besides, have you taken a look
at Agent Mills' case?

12:39.522 --> 12:41.589
Oh, yeah. Ex-cop.
Great conviction rate.

12:41.624 --> 12:43.557
But, I mean, what is with
that partner of hers?

12:43.593 --> 12:45.860
What kind of parent gives their
kid a weird name like Ichabod?

12:45.895 --> 12:47.261
It probably scarred him
for life.

12:47.296 --> 12:48.762
It's a little unusual.

12:48.798 --> 12:50.865
But most names are.
You got a problem with that?

12:50.900 --> 12:53.267
Oh, right. I forgot. Nothing
weird about the name Seeley.

12:53.302 --> 12:55.302
Kid next door was named Seeley.
Of course, he didn't turn out

12:55.338 --> 12:56.670
too well.
That's got nothing to do...

12:56.706 --> 12:57.905
It's okay, all right?

12:57.940 --> 12:59.240
Just drop it.

12:59.275 --> 13:01.408
Thank you.

13:03.512 --> 13:06.280
CRANE: <i>Fascinating.</i>
BRENNAN: <i> Oh!</i>

13:06.315 --> 13:08.015
(chuckles)
I'm glad you appreciate this.

13:08.050 --> 13:10.818
The Jeffersonian
is the most advanced

13:10.853 --> 13:13.854
forensic science
lab in the world.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.856
One might say
it represents

13:15.892 --> 13:17.992
the realized dream
of its namesake.

13:18.027 --> 13:19.960
These remains

13:19.996 --> 13:22.329
are at least
200 years old.

13:22.365 --> 13:24.031
Why are they

13:24.066 --> 13:25.066
of such concern to you?

13:25.101 --> 13:26.533
The question is not "why?"

13:26.569 --> 13:29.003
The question is "who?"

13:29.038 --> 13:30.971
Agent Mills
and I believe this

13:31.007 --> 13:35.910
to be Abraham Van Brunt,
an Englishman born in 1749

13:35.945 --> 13:39.780
and decapitated
on the battlefield in 1781

13:39.815 --> 13:41.715
by a patriot

13:41.751 --> 13:46.220
wielding
a Fishkill-Bailey cutlass.

13:46.255 --> 13:50.157
Age and ancestry of the remains
are consistent with Van Brunt.

13:50.192 --> 13:53.060
However,
in terms of decapitation,

13:53.095 --> 13:55.696
you are off by 234 years.

13:55.731 --> 13:57.564
The striae on
the victim's neck

13:57.600 --> 14:01.969
indicate
a modern fine-tooth saw.

14:02.004 --> 14:05.239
I'll grant
that is an inconsistency.

14:05.274 --> 14:08.242
We are trying to determine
identity as we speak.

14:08.277 --> 14:09.843
My colleague, Ms. Montenegro,

14:09.879 --> 14:11.879
is working on a facial
reconstruction.

14:11.914 --> 14:13.914
Oh. Here she is now.

14:13.950 --> 14:17.251
Angela, this is Ichabod Crane.

14:17.286 --> 14:19.053
I await
your marvels

14:19.088 --> 14:21.622
with bated breath,
Ms. Montenegro.

14:21.657 --> 14:24.458
Oh. Uh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

14:24.493 --> 14:26.760
I like the... like the jacket.

14:26.796 --> 14:29.830
Uh, I used the
bone structure

14:29.865 --> 14:32.833
of the corpse and DNA evidence
of coloring and hair

14:32.868 --> 14:36.704
to recreate this approximation
of the victim's facial features.

14:36.739 --> 14:38.205
And if I run this

14:38.240 --> 14:39.907
through the historical
portrait database,

14:39.942 --> 14:43.110
hopefully we'll
get a match.

14:49.585 --> 14:52.853
You and Agent Mills
are exceedingly persistent,

14:52.888 --> 14:54.822
which I find

14:54.857 --> 14:57.424
both irritating and impressive.

14:57.460 --> 15:00.060
We are a partnership
of opposites.

15:00.096 --> 15:03.931
Yet our affinity for one another
bears the ripest of fruit.

15:03.966 --> 15:05.699
Oh. I was unaware

15:05.735 --> 15:08.302
that you and your colleague
were sexual partners.

15:08.337 --> 15:11.238
I can assure you, we are not.

15:11.273 --> 15:13.674
Then I would suggest
you consider it.

15:13.709 --> 15:17.044
I have found taking
my professional life with Booth

15:17.079 --> 15:18.779
into the personal realm
has been...

15:18.814 --> 15:21.348
quite rewarding.
(chuckles)

15:22.251 --> 15:23.984
(computer blipping)

15:25.021 --> 15:26.987
Saved by the bell.
Is this

15:27.023 --> 15:28.989
the man you were expecting
to find?

15:29.892 --> 15:31.792
Actually, no.

15:31.827 --> 15:33.794
Oh, well, then that's
a good thing, right?

15:33.829 --> 15:36.463
No.

15:36.499 --> 15:40.534
It is of the utmost consequence,
far worse than I thought.

15:40.569 --> 15:42.102
This...

15:42.138 --> 15:45.539
is General William Howe,
commander of the British forces

15:45.574 --> 15:47.041
during the War for Independence.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.310
A blackguard, a man
as famed for his cruelty

15:50.346 --> 15:52.980
as his strategic mind.

15:53.015 --> 15:54.982
Okay. Uh, well,
according to this,

15:55.017 --> 15:57.851
he was buried
in Twickenham, England.

15:57.887 --> 16:01.355
And yet the facts
say otherwise.

16:01.390 --> 16:04.124
Dr. Brennan, we have stumbled

16:04.160 --> 16:06.660
upon a mystery of the
highest magnitude,

16:06.695 --> 16:11.398
and I shall not rest
until it is solved.

16:15.504 --> 16:17.905
Thanks for letting me
ride shotgun on your case.

16:17.940 --> 16:20.107
So, you applied
to the Bureau

16:20.142 --> 16:22.609
three years ago and then
you retracted. Why is that?

16:22.645 --> 16:24.821
You quit last year,
and now you're back. How come?

16:24.845 --> 16:25.680
(chuckles)

16:25.681 --> 16:28.849
I guess
we both have timing issues.

16:28.884 --> 16:32.719
Place seems a lot more... med
student than devil worshiper.

16:32.755 --> 16:37.658
Oh, how 'bout this?
"Last night was insane. XX."

16:37.693 --> 16:39.326
She has a boyfriend, right?
You want to take

16:39.361 --> 16:40.594
another crack at him?
Doesn't make sense.

16:40.629 --> 16:42.896
No, they've been dating
for over a year.

16:42.932 --> 16:46.166
Weren't there nails pried out
of the floorboards

16:46.202 --> 16:48.168
at that old church?

16:48.204 --> 16:49.803
Look at that, huh?

16:49.839 --> 16:51.738
Mm-hmm.
Uh-oh.

16:51.774 --> 16:55.876
This just keeps getting better.

16:55.911 --> 16:57.744
Fine-tooth saw.

16:57.780 --> 17:00.614
I'm assuming that isn't sawdust.

17:00.649 --> 17:02.749
BOOTH:
Looks like a piece of fabric.

17:02.785 --> 17:04.852
Bones said
this is the same type of saw

17:04.887 --> 17:07.121
that was used on General Howe.

17:10.893 --> 17:13.060
CRANE:
I believe this to be

17:13.095 --> 17:15.462
the infamous <i> Librum Sub Umbras.</i>

17:15.498 --> 17:21.034
That is Latin for "A Treatise
on the Subject of Shadows."

17:21.069 --> 17:22.970
First published
in the early Middle Ages.

17:23.005 --> 17:24.271
Alchemical recipes,

17:24.306 --> 17:26.473
blood rituals, druidic rites,

17:26.509 --> 17:29.243
necromancy.

17:29.278 --> 17:32.179
Dude, that is
so <i> Evil Dead.</i>

17:32.214 --> 17:34.248
Well, the pages
are parchment.

17:34.283 --> 17:36.483
The decorative edging has
a different chemical makeup

17:36.519 --> 17:38.218
altogether...

17:38.254 --> 17:40.020
Thank you.
What would

17:40.055 --> 17:43.790
a medical student be doing
with a book of nonsense?

17:43.826 --> 17:45.792
This is a book
of spells.

17:45.828 --> 17:48.462
But how to unlock it
would remain hidden to all

17:48.497 --> 17:52.432
but the most
learned scholars.

17:52.468 --> 17:55.435
These are replicas
of an illuminated manuscript

17:55.471 --> 17:58.539
first painted by Bavarian
monastic scholars.

17:58.574 --> 18:00.641
Illuminated.

18:00.676 --> 18:01.708
Oh, that's it.

18:01.744 --> 18:03.710
Illuminated!

18:03.746 --> 18:06.146
Guys, we have
to illuminate the text.

18:06.182 --> 18:08.882
We need, like,
candlelight.

18:08.918 --> 18:10.817
I'm on it.

18:22.431 --> 18:23.964
"This text shall be the guide

18:23.999 --> 18:26.466
"by which the witness
shall procure the skull

18:26.502 --> 18:30.204
which will grant him the power
to raise the dead."

18:30.239 --> 18:33.073
HODGES: That explains why
Sarah dug up the skull.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.478
Very well played, sir.

18:38.514 --> 18:40.347
Back at you, brother.

18:40.382 --> 18:45.986
Now, if only I had the resources
to delve a little deeper.

18:46.021 --> 18:48.622
Oh, please. This is
the Jeffersonian.

18:48.657 --> 18:49.923
It's like Archive City.

18:49.959 --> 18:52.092
We've got
Columbus's logbooks,

18:52.127 --> 18:53.527
Washington's laundry lists...

18:53.562 --> 18:55.963
Use anything you need,
Mr. Crane.

18:55.998 --> 19:01.168
As I'm here, I might
as well make myself useful.

19:03.706 --> 19:05.973
(computer blipping rapidly)

19:06.008 --> 19:09.109
I've looked for ligature marks,
burns, symmetrical scarring.

19:09.144 --> 19:11.778
So far, no indicators
of ritualistic murder.

19:11.814 --> 19:13.547
May I?

19:13.582 --> 19:17.150
I did find
what appears to be

19:17.186 --> 19:19.620
a perimortem depression
fracture on the frontal bone.

19:19.655 --> 19:21.855
That doesn't look severe enough
to have killed her.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.057
It wasn't, but the description
of the wound suggests

19:24.093 --> 19:26.226
that it was caused
by a curved object.

19:26.262 --> 19:27.561
SAROYAN: There appears
to be ischemic damage

19:27.596 --> 19:29.229
to the victim's brain.

19:29.265 --> 19:31.431
It's consistent with the brain
having lacked oxygen

19:31.467 --> 19:33.233
in a series
of short bursts.

19:33.269 --> 19:35.235
The oxygen supply to the brain
could have been cut off

19:35.271 --> 19:36.870
if the victim
had been strangled.

19:36.905 --> 19:38.939
I'll double-check the
hyoid for microfracturing.

19:38.974 --> 19:40.540
I don't think
that's the cause.

19:40.576 --> 19:43.877
The resulting web of
dead neurons in the hippocampus

19:43.912 --> 19:46.079
is consistent
with clinical death.

19:46.115 --> 19:48.115
Which makes sense,
because our victim is dead.

19:48.150 --> 19:51.218
However, it looks like
these neurons have been dead

19:51.253 --> 19:52.886
for about two weeks.

19:52.921 --> 19:54.588
Meaning?

19:54.623 --> 19:58.191
Sarah died before she died?

19:58.227 --> 20:02.663
Maybe the person Sarah
brought back from the dead

20:02.698 --> 20:04.831
was herself.

20:13.578 --> 20:15.378
AUBREY:
<i>She made you think</i>

20:15.413 --> 20:16.946
that you were
eating human brains,

20:16.981 --> 20:18.614
so the only appropriate
prank back would be

20:18.650 --> 20:20.783
to make her think that she's
eating something worse.

20:20.818 --> 20:22.351
Like what?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.453
I'm thinking...
I hate soy cheese.

20:24.489 --> 20:25.921
She already eats that stuff.
Oh.

20:25.957 --> 20:27.623
Well, then she's in her
own personal hell.

20:27.659 --> 20:29.258
There's nothing I can do.

20:29.294 --> 20:30.860
Don't worry about it,
okay?

20:30.895 --> 20:33.195
I got something brewing.
I'm working on it, okay?

20:33.231 --> 20:35.231
I got it all set up.
(chuckles)

20:35.266 --> 20:37.099
Okay.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.769
So, supposedly, Sarah died and
was resuscitated two weeks ago.

20:39.804 --> 20:41.637
But I checked out her
health insurance, and there's

20:41.673 --> 20:43.839
no record of her visiting a hospital.
Our victim

20:43.875 --> 20:46.542
was a med student.
My guess is that she OD'd

20:46.577 --> 20:48.311
and one of her friends
had to revive her.

20:48.346 --> 20:50.179
Well, maybe. But there's nothing
in her financials

20:50.214 --> 20:51.947
that suggests a drug problem.

20:51.983 --> 20:53.249
What'd you find out?
Pretty normal stuff.

20:53.284 --> 20:55.117
I mean, online shopping,

20:55.153 --> 20:57.019
takeout,
but there was

20:57.055 --> 20:59.355
this one night, two weeks ago.

20:59.390 --> 21:01.590
$250 on a bottle of champagne

21:01.626 --> 21:03.659
on a Monday night?
Right? I mean,

21:03.695 --> 21:05.628
if it was a Tuesday,
I'd understand.

21:05.663 --> 21:07.129
The point is
she was celebrating, all right?

21:07.165 --> 21:08.898
She probably was out partying,

21:08.933 --> 21:10.866
was drinking too much,
you know, right?

21:10.902 --> 21:13.102
It was an accident,
and she had to be revived.

21:13.137 --> 21:16.806
Oh. So the question is:
who was she celebrating with?

21:18.710 --> 21:20.609
The depression fracture
on the frontal bone

21:20.645 --> 21:22.311
is evidence of
blunt force trauma.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.580
Within the injury
is a deep linear fracture.

21:24.615 --> 21:26.482
It contains bone
from another body

21:26.517 --> 21:28.951
that was laced with arsenic
and mercury.

21:28.986 --> 21:30.820
Like General Howe's remains.

21:30.855 --> 21:32.722
But his bones were undisturbed.

21:32.757 --> 21:35.658
So Sarah may have been beaten
to death with his skull?

21:35.693 --> 21:38.394
The general's skull would have
caused the depression fracture

21:38.429 --> 21:39.762
upon initial impact.

21:39.797 --> 21:42.264
Then once the killer
struck multiple times...

21:42.300 --> 21:44.066
The skull shattered,
and a jagged piece of it

21:44.102 --> 21:46.635
severed the anterior sphenopalatine.
The sphenopalatine

21:46.671 --> 21:49.004
is the terminal branch
of the maxillary artery.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.006
Sarah's nose would have burst
like a pipe.

21:51.042 --> 21:54.176
So Howe's skull giveth life
and taketh it away.

21:54.212 --> 21:55.711
Oh, come on.
You don't actually believe

21:55.747 --> 21:57.146
the skull
has supernatural power.

21:57.181 --> 21:58.647
Please.
I'm a conspiracy theorist,

21:58.683 --> 22:00.416
not a supernatural nut.
(chuckles)

22:00.451 --> 22:02.985
BRAY: I also found a slight
fracture to the victim's

22:03.020 --> 22:05.755
left inferior
scapular apex.

22:05.790 --> 22:08.491
That suggests Sarah fell
into something sharp.

22:08.526 --> 22:12.094
All right, I'll run it for trace
and see what I can find.

22:16.334 --> 22:18.334
So, I just got back
from the bar

22:18.369 --> 22:20.736
where Sarah drank
that expensive champagne.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.372
Oh, wait a second. You went
to the bar without telling me?

22:23.408 --> 22:25.741
Was I supposed to wait on you
to fill out a permission slip?

22:25.777 --> 22:28.344
Corbin was right about you--
not one for following the rules.

22:28.379 --> 22:31.213
You knew August Corbin?
Yeah. You know what?

22:31.249 --> 22:32.849
He mentioned you
last time that we spoke.

22:32.884 --> 22:35.851
He said that, um, you were
a lot like me back in the day.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.186
I cannot believe it.

22:37.221 --> 22:38.621
He thought you
and I were alike.

22:38.656 --> 22:40.055
That is high praise.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.991
He said that you would have
made a great agent.

22:42.026 --> 22:44.827
But...?

22:44.862 --> 22:46.896
Just don't think

22:46.931 --> 22:49.932
that you have to save the world,
all in one day.

22:53.471 --> 22:55.271
What did you find out
at the bar?

22:55.306 --> 22:59.408
I spoke to a waitress who
remembered seeing Sarah

22:59.444 --> 23:02.411
celebrating with a dark-haired
guy, slight build.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.513
Wait a second. That doesn't
sound like her boyfriend.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.916
And so, if Sarah wasn't
with Joel on the night

23:06.951 --> 23:09.385
that her entire life
changed, who was she with?

23:13.257 --> 23:15.257
I wasn't having an affair
with Sarah Lippman.

23:15.293 --> 23:17.193
You were seen drinking champagne
with Sarah.

23:17.228 --> 23:20.496
Plus, handwriting analysis says
that you wrote this.

23:25.536 --> 23:27.837
Well, there's a problem
with your theory.

23:27.872 --> 23:29.772
I'm gay.

23:29.807 --> 23:32.341
Sarah and I were friends,
colleagues.

23:32.376 --> 23:34.343
That's it.

23:34.378 --> 23:37.179
Okay, then. What were
you celebrating, hmm?

23:37.215 --> 23:40.616
What happened
that was "insane"?

23:42.920 --> 23:45.321
Hey, you know what?
I don't even have time for this.

23:45.356 --> 23:46.956
I already got enough
to indict you.

23:46.991 --> 23:48.591
Wait.

23:49.794 --> 23:51.627
Sarah and I became friends

23:51.662 --> 23:54.597
because we both had close calls
with death.

23:54.632 --> 23:57.466
I was really sick
as a kid,

23:57.502 --> 24:00.603
and Sarah had a sister
that died young.

24:00.638 --> 24:03.472
She was desperate
to find out

24:03.508 --> 24:05.274
what happens after.

24:05.309 --> 24:09.078
As in, after life?

24:09.113 --> 24:10.880
I mean, we're doctors, right?

24:10.915 --> 24:13.582
We're taught how to bring people
back from the brink.

24:13.618 --> 24:15.518
So Sarah asked me to...

24:15.553 --> 24:17.086
To kill her.
I induced

24:17.121 --> 24:20.723
her heart to stop,
and then I restarted it.

24:20.758 --> 24:22.324
I brought her back.

24:22.360 --> 24:24.226
And you did this
two weeks ago?

24:24.262 --> 24:27.296
She said it was transformative.

24:27.331 --> 24:29.298
You know, she saw
her sister,

24:29.333 --> 24:33.903
and her sister told her
to let go of all her fear.

24:33.938 --> 24:37.039
That... is what
we were celebrating.

24:37.074 --> 24:39.308
It was science...

24:39.343 --> 24:41.677
at its most powerful.

24:41.712 --> 24:45.414
Science? And was it science that
made you dig up the skull of

24:45.449 --> 24:47.049
a Redcoat general
to help you?

24:47.084 --> 24:49.151
I didn't dig anything up.

24:49.186 --> 24:51.353
Sarah had this weird idea

24:51.389 --> 24:53.856
that thing had power,
but I didn't buy it.

24:53.891 --> 24:55.991
You know, I just thought
it was...

24:56.027 --> 24:59.528
like a rabbit's foot...
for good luck.

24:59.564 --> 25:01.363
Where is that rabbit's foot now?

25:01.399 --> 25:03.465
I have no idea.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.868
The last time I saw it was...

25:05.903 --> 25:07.937
in the lab when we... did it,

25:07.972 --> 25:09.605
but after Sarah crossed over,

25:09.640 --> 25:12.374
we weren't thinking
about the skull.

25:12.410 --> 25:13.876
(laughs)

25:13.911 --> 25:16.245
You just admitted to
stopping someone's heart.

25:16.280 --> 25:20.683
That's attempted murder
of someone who's now dead.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.920
(quietly):
Yeah.

25:26.991 --> 25:29.391
I swabbed Sarah's
scapular injury.

25:29.427 --> 25:32.494
Hopefully the Mass Spec will
give us something useful.

25:32.530 --> 25:35.998
Hey, do Abbie and Ichabod

25:36.033 --> 25:38.400
remind you of any other couples?

25:38.436 --> 25:42.805
Oh, my God,
you're totally right!

25:42.840 --> 25:44.907
They're us!

25:44.942 --> 25:47.876
I mean, she's beautiful, he has
an incredible head of hair.

25:47.912 --> 25:49.979
I was actually talking
about Brennan and Booth.

25:50.014 --> 25:52.114
Mm, I don't see it.

25:52.149 --> 25:54.516
(computer beeping)

25:54.552 --> 25:56.752
That's interesting.
Hexachloride

25:56.787 --> 25:58.854
is common
in industrial cleaners.

25:58.889 --> 26:00.856
Well, that's not gonna help you very much.
Well, it does

26:00.891 --> 26:03.792
when it's combined with
vermin-proof bitumastic.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.661
Why does that sound familiar?

26:05.696 --> 26:07.696
It's sprayed on the
underside of morgue tables.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.965
Same as you'd find
in an anatomy room.

26:15.706 --> 26:17.072
Isn't it kind of pointless

26:17.108 --> 26:19.508
to ALS for blood
in a place like this?

26:19.543 --> 26:21.810
It's like looking
for a needle in a needle stack.

26:21.846 --> 26:24.079
Well, we're not looking
for pools of blood.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.514
We're looking
for spatter.

26:25.549 --> 26:27.650
Like the kind made
from a live body.

26:27.685 --> 26:29.251
Oh. So, I'm guessing

26:29.286 --> 26:32.454
that cadavers don't spout blood
like Old Yeller.

26:32.490 --> 26:35.090
Old Yeller is a dog.

26:35.126 --> 26:36.892
You're thinking of Old
Faithful, the geyser.

26:36.927 --> 26:39.762
You sure about that?
Yeah, pretty sure.

26:39.797 --> 26:42.665
I can't imagine taking a chance
with life like Sarah did.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.633
You're not curious what happens?

26:44.669 --> 26:46.335
I know what happens.
The heart stops,

26:46.370 --> 26:48.537
brain functions cease,
the body quits.

26:48.572 --> 26:50.773
Yeah, I know, but
you know, after that.

26:50.808 --> 26:52.808
Are you talking
about Heaven?

26:52.843 --> 26:55.878
Yeah. Maybe.

26:55.913 --> 26:57.680
Look, I hate to say it,
but I do not think

26:57.715 --> 26:59.381
that the victim died here.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.116
I don't see any evidence
of arterial spray.

27:01.152 --> 27:02.785
Uh, that's because

27:02.820 --> 27:05.487
you're not looking
in the right places.

27:05.523 --> 27:08.490
Oh, wow.

27:08.526 --> 27:11.794
Of course. Her heart
was still pumping.

27:11.829 --> 27:15.064
So, Sarah's sphenopalatine
artery was severed.

27:15.099 --> 27:17.833
Her blood shot all the
way up to the ceiling.

27:17.868 --> 27:20.636
Looks like
we found our crime scene.

27:26.004 --> 27:28.500
Oh, Mr. Crane, have
you made valuable

27:28.501 --> 27:31.002
use of your time
in our archives?

27:31.037 --> 27:33.571
Impressive,
to say the very least.

27:33.606 --> 27:37.475
Jefferson would have
certainly approved.

27:37.510 --> 27:39.477
More secrets revealed?

27:39.512 --> 27:40.978
These...

27:41.014 --> 27:43.748
are remodeled puncture marks
on Sarah's ilium.

27:43.783 --> 27:45.817
Consistent
with bone marrow donation.

27:45.852 --> 27:47.952
A procedure more suited
to family members,

27:47.987 --> 27:49.520
if I'm not mistaken?

27:49.556 --> 27:51.022
You are not.

27:51.057 --> 27:53.758
Sarah's sister died
of cancer. These marks

27:53.793 --> 27:56.460
indicate Sarah may have given

27:56.496 --> 27:58.663
bone marrow in an
effort to save her.

27:58.698 --> 28:01.532
Perhaps the untimely death
of her sister

28:01.568 --> 28:05.570
compelled Miss Lippmann
to seek out the hereafter.

28:05.605 --> 28:07.238
(scoffs)

28:07.273 --> 28:08.906
The hereafter
doesn't exist.

28:08.942 --> 28:12.243
It's nothing but a
fiction we created

28:12.278 --> 28:16.480
to fight the biological
inevitability of death.

28:16.516 --> 28:21.853
Some inevitabilities take
longer than others.

28:21.888 --> 28:26.023
I see your search in the
archives was fruitful?

28:26.059 --> 28:29.727
Oh, yes, a most
fascinating find.

28:29.762 --> 28:31.362
One which, hopefully,

28:31.397 --> 28:34.098
will assist Agent Mills
and me in our endeavors.

28:34.133 --> 28:35.766
Hmm.

28:35.802 --> 28:38.069
This is convenient.

28:38.104 --> 28:40.238
An edict

28:40.273 --> 28:42.940
from George Washington ordering

28:42.976 --> 28:45.910
the remains of General
Howe to be entombed,

28:45.945 --> 28:48.479
not in England, but
in the Colonies.

28:48.514 --> 28:51.249
Hmm. Preferably
in Sleepy Hollow,

28:51.284 --> 28:54.085
where his headstone will be
a magnificent addition

28:54.120 --> 28:57.421
to our Founding Fathers
burial site.

28:57.457 --> 28:58.990
The signature

28:59.025 --> 29:01.058
clearly doesn't match
the handwriting.

29:01.094 --> 29:03.461
However, General
Washington's diaries--

29:03.496 --> 29:06.130
also readily available
in your archives--

29:06.165 --> 29:08.766
will corroborate
that this missive was dictated

29:08.801 --> 29:11.469
to a trusted captain.

29:11.504 --> 29:13.304
The intent

29:13.339 --> 29:18.209
and legal weight of its contents
should be fairly self-evident.

29:18.244 --> 29:22.013
If this letter does
prove authentic,

29:22.048 --> 29:24.849
you can have
your body back.

29:24.884 --> 29:28.586
Until then, it stays
at the Jeffersonian.

29:35.528 --> 29:36.894
All right, well, this is
all the medical waste

29:36.930 --> 29:38.529
from the anatomy room.

29:38.564 --> 29:39.897
It's a good place for a killer

29:39.933 --> 29:41.732
to dump any evidence.

29:41.768 --> 29:44.368
Now we have to go through all of
it to find General Howe's skull.

29:44.404 --> 29:46.304
Yeah, that's where the fun is!

29:46.339 --> 29:50.241
I'm as excited as a little boy
on Christmas morning.

29:50.276 --> 29:53.678
That makes me feel just a little
bad for Michael Vincent.

29:53.713 --> 29:55.947
Oh.

29:55.982 --> 29:58.716
These bones shards appear to be

29:58.751 --> 30:01.552
the same age as General Howe's skull.
Nice work, Mr. Bray.

30:01.587 --> 30:04.789
You may have found a portion
of our murder weapon.

30:04.824 --> 30:07.925
Let's see if it's
in this grab bag.

30:07.961 --> 30:10.127
This looks promising.

30:12.332 --> 30:16.200
Okay. Band-Aids.

30:16.235 --> 30:18.736
Oof! Blood-soaked towels.

30:18.771 --> 30:20.638
Used gauze.

30:20.673 --> 30:22.707
Hey, check this out.

30:22.742 --> 30:24.909
Oh. Hmm.
Broken porcelain.

30:24.944 --> 30:26.777
Probably a coffee mug.

30:26.813 --> 30:28.512
SAROYAN:
These are

30:28.548 --> 30:30.014
injection vials.

30:30.049 --> 30:31.549
BRAY:
Hmm. Looks like they're empty.

30:31.584 --> 30:33.017
I guess that's not unusual

30:33.052 --> 30:34.352
when you're going
through medical waste.

30:34.387 --> 30:35.820
They're from
an anatomy lab.

30:35.855 --> 30:38.856
There are no patients
there, just cadavers.

30:38.891 --> 30:40.691
And these labels are illegible.

30:40.727 --> 30:42.693
The writing must have rubbed off.
HODGINS: There's probably

30:42.729 --> 30:45.463
still some trace in the vials.
I'll see what I can find.

30:47.066 --> 30:49.000
Found it.

30:49.035 --> 30:52.236
HODGINS:
General William Howe.

30:52.271 --> 30:54.872
I cannot say that
it's an honor.

30:59.512 --> 31:02.313
Slow down, Bones. Okay, look,
I know that Crane is annoying,

31:02.348 --> 31:04.582
but what would you like me
to do, huh? Deport him?

31:04.617 --> 31:06.751
Relax. Okay,
I will take care of it.

31:06.786 --> 31:08.185
Don't worry. I got it.

31:08.221 --> 31:10.521
Just go look
at a dead body or something.

31:10.556 --> 31:12.289
Ichabod causing trouble?

31:12.325 --> 31:13.958
The guy--
he wants General Howe's body,

31:13.993 --> 31:16.093
and Bones-- she's really not hip
to that right now.

31:16.129 --> 31:18.596
So, I just got
word from Hodgins.

31:18.631 --> 31:19.930
He found drugs in the vials

31:19.966 --> 31:21.932
where the victim did her
little death experiment.

31:21.968 --> 31:23.167
Calcium chloride and Verapamil.

31:23.202 --> 31:24.969
Yeah. Turns out,

31:25.004 --> 31:27.772
the prescriptions were filled
at St. Francis Medical Center

31:27.807 --> 31:29.240
the night the victim was killed.

31:29.275 --> 31:31.876
Any idea who wrote the prescription?
Yeah.

31:31.911 --> 31:34.378
The chief resident of
Sarah Lippman's medical program,

31:34.414 --> 31:36.347
Dr. John Cruz.

31:38.618 --> 31:42.586
It's a simple question:
Is Mr. Crane a liar or not?

31:42.622 --> 31:45.056
Well, I'm saying
it's not a simple answer.

31:45.091 --> 31:47.391
Is the document real?

31:47.427 --> 31:49.727
Well, the paper is Dutch hemp,

31:49.762 --> 31:53.364
and its degradation dates
it to the late 1700s.

31:53.399 --> 31:57.268
So Crane found old paper,
but the ink is fake.

31:57.303 --> 31:59.170
No, the ink is iron gall

31:59.205 --> 32:00.905
from iron salts

32:00.940 --> 32:02.306
and tannic acids.

32:02.341 --> 32:03.774
Which was the standard in Europe

32:03.810 --> 32:06.210
from the fifth
to the 19th century.

32:06.245 --> 32:08.612
But the signature is fake?

32:08.648 --> 32:11.749
No. I compared it pixel by pixel

32:11.784 --> 32:14.585
to Washington's signature
on the Constitution.

32:14.620 --> 32:18.989
The slant and spacing show
that it's a perfect match.

32:19.025 --> 32:20.958
Looks like I owe
Mr. Crane an apology.

32:20.993 --> 32:22.359
Not yet.

32:22.395 --> 32:24.295
I also examined the handwriting

32:24.330 --> 32:27.364
of the officer that Washington
was dictating to.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.866
And?

32:28.901 --> 32:31.268
It's an exact match to the notes

32:31.304 --> 32:33.037
that Ichabod Crane took

32:33.072 --> 32:34.839
when he was deciphering
<i>The Book of Shadows,</i>

32:34.874 --> 32:36.173
here in the lab.

32:36.209 --> 32:37.942
The stops and lifts

32:37.977 --> 32:40.411
of his cursive lettering
are unmistakable.

32:40.446 --> 32:41.779
BRENNAN:
But this letter

32:41.814 --> 32:44.882
has been in our archives
for half a century.

32:44.917 --> 32:46.951
I can't explain this,

32:46.986 --> 32:49.887
unless he went back in time and
forged it in the Revolution.

32:49.922 --> 32:51.422
Well, that would
be impossible.

32:51.457 --> 32:53.791
I know.
But there's no question.

32:53.826 --> 32:56.861
The handwriting belongs
to Ichabod Crane.

33:05.883 --> 33:08.888
I'm hoping you can help me with
a little problem I'm having.

33:08.988 --> 33:10.587
I can't seem
to figure out

33:10.623 --> 33:12.456
what these two people
have in common.

33:16.463 --> 33:18.129
They're both my patients.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.098
But oddly enough,
neither one of them

33:20.133 --> 33:22.633
got the meds that you ordered
for them three days ago.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.852
Then maybe you should talking
to the nursing staff.

33:25.853 --> 33:27.419
They never got
the order because

33:27.454 --> 33:29.320
the patients didn't need
the meds.

33:29.356 --> 33:31.089
Sarah Lippman did.

33:32.659 --> 33:36.160
Why would Sarah Lippman need
verapamil and calcium chloride?

33:36.196 --> 33:38.496
I think you know why.

33:38.531 --> 33:41.132
To stop her heart,
and then start it again.

33:41.167 --> 33:43.434
Same thing she did
two weeks before

33:43.470 --> 33:45.570
when you prescribed
the same two medications

33:45.605 --> 33:49.007
for two other patients,
who also never got them.

33:49.042 --> 33:52.010
I told her it was crazy.

33:52.045 --> 33:53.811
I tried to talk her out of it.

33:53.847 --> 33:55.079
But you just couldn't say no

33:55.115 --> 33:56.514
because you were sleeping
with her.

33:56.549 --> 33:57.582
I wasn't sleeping with her.

33:57.617 --> 33:59.517
Well...

33:59.552 --> 34:01.519
if that isn't it, then...

34:01.554 --> 34:03.955
why did you kill her,
Dr. Cruz?

34:03.990 --> 34:05.356
I didn't kill her.

34:05.392 --> 34:06.758
Why else would we find
the murder weapon

34:06.793 --> 34:08.359
next to the drugs
that you ordered?

34:08.395 --> 34:11.795
(sighs)
Okay.

34:11.831 --> 34:13.464
My wife did leave me,

34:13.500 --> 34:16.067
but Sarah had nothing
to do with that.

34:17.237 --> 34:19.504
I was a wreck,
I was drinking too much,

34:19.539 --> 34:21.539
and once--<i> once--</i>

34:21.574 --> 34:24.242
I was scrubbing
out of surgery and...

34:24.277 --> 34:26.444
Sarah smelled it on my breath.

34:26.478 --> 34:29.013
She blackmailed you
to get the drugs?

34:30.583 --> 34:33.717
I'd already lost my wife.

34:33.753 --> 34:36.420
I couldn't lose anything else.

34:36.456 --> 34:38.489
So instead of risking
your career,

34:38.525 --> 34:41.292
you let two students
risk their lives

34:41.327 --> 34:43.261
trying to kill each other.

34:43.295 --> 34:45.663
Congratulations.

34:45.697 --> 34:48.733
It looks like
one of them succeeded.

34:51.737 --> 34:53.103
(knocking)

34:53.139 --> 34:55.773
I understand you have
authenticated the letter.

34:55.809 --> 34:58.709
Please, no need to apologize
for doubting its veracity.

34:58.745 --> 35:01.112
Actually,
I was wondering

35:01.147 --> 35:03.114
if you can resolve
a paradox for me.

35:03.149 --> 35:04.348
Do tell.

35:04.384 --> 35:07.318
A document on
200-year-old paper,

35:07.353 --> 35:10.388
written in
200-year-old ink

35:10.423 --> 35:13.057
found to have been
written by a man

35:13.093 --> 35:17.862
who was born 200 years after
the document was created.

35:18.965 --> 35:21.699
Mm, clearly an impossibility.

35:21.734 --> 35:23.401
And yet...

35:29.642 --> 35:32.410
...the handwriting is a match.

35:32.445 --> 35:34.745
Wh... um...

35:36.649 --> 35:38.850
I knew of this letter

35:38.885 --> 35:41.819
because it was written by
an officer in the Patriot Army

35:41.855 --> 35:44.422
named Ichabod Crane.

35:45.525 --> 35:47.258
Your ancestor.

35:47.293 --> 35:49.060
Not being a scientist
of your expertise,

35:49.095 --> 35:50.695
I cannot say
whether handwriting

35:50.730 --> 35:53.364
is an inherited trait.

35:53.399 --> 35:55.867
Well, I have never known that
to be a possibility.

35:55.902 --> 35:57.535
Hence, your paradox.

35:57.570 --> 36:00.438
Clearly I could not have
been there to have written it.

36:03.676 --> 36:07.145
"If you eliminate all
other possibilities,

36:07.180 --> 36:11.382
whatever remains
must be the truth."

36:11.417 --> 36:14.619
Sherlock Holmes.
(laughs softly)

36:14.654 --> 36:16.320
So I take it this means you'll
allow me to take the body?

36:16.356 --> 36:18.689
When the case is solved.

36:18.725 --> 36:20.491
As it turns out,

36:20.527 --> 36:22.927
Howe's skull is
the murder weapon.

36:22.962 --> 36:26.631
We found it in the waste
from the anatomy lab.

36:26.666 --> 36:29.901
Based on the
fractured occipital,

36:29.936 --> 36:33.738
it appears the killer
held the skull like so.

36:33.773 --> 36:35.373
Our best bet would
have been to find

36:35.408 --> 36:37.742
trace evidence in
General Howe's canine.

36:37.777 --> 36:39.644
However, it was knocked
out during the murder

36:39.679 --> 36:41.012
and we can't find it.

36:41.047 --> 36:42.713
Because it came loose.

36:42.749 --> 36:45.616
He was thrown by a wild
stallion he was trying to tame

36:45.652 --> 36:48.452
after he took control
of the British forces.

36:48.488 --> 36:52.023
Wouldn't a man of his stature
have used false teeth?

36:52.058 --> 36:53.491
Iron, or ivory,

36:53.526 --> 36:54.725
or animal teeth?

36:54.761 --> 36:56.460
Oh, he tried those.

36:56.496 --> 37:00.731
Then he learned the French
had developed porcelain teeth.

37:00.767 --> 37:05.303
If Howe's canine
was porcelain,

37:05.338 --> 37:07.438
it would have shattered
on impact,

37:07.473 --> 37:11.375
possibly injuring
the killer's hand.

37:17.350 --> 37:18.983
Mr. Crane brought
to my attention

37:19.018 --> 37:20.685
that we made
a faulty assumption.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.154
We didn't account for the
magical powers of the skull?

37:23.189 --> 37:24.655
No, we didn't account
for the fact

37:24.691 --> 37:26.290
that the missing tooth
isn't a tooth.

37:26.326 --> 37:28.926
So, he had a false tooth?
Yes.

37:28.962 --> 37:31.195
Made of porcelain.
If the tooth

37:31.231 --> 37:32.730
scraped the killer's hand...

37:32.765 --> 37:34.265
There's a significant
possibility

37:34.300 --> 37:36.067
of recovering epithelial cells.

37:36.102 --> 37:39.370
But if Howe had a porcelain
tooth, where is it now?

37:39.405 --> 37:40.571
Porcelain.

37:40.607 --> 37:41.739
The coffee cup.

37:41.774 --> 37:43.474
I-I have all of these pieces

37:43.509 --> 37:45.142
of a broken coffee cup.

37:45.178 --> 37:48.312
The porcelain could have
easily gotten mixed in there.

37:48.348 --> 37:50.848
Dr. Hodgins,
go over that piece again here.

37:50.883 --> 37:52.383
Its hue doesn't match
the others.

37:52.418 --> 37:54.151
SAROYAN:
You're right.

37:54.187 --> 37:58.155
And it's got a pointed cusp
and single root like a canine.

37:58.191 --> 38:00.191
Bet it was nice and shiny,
back in the day.

38:00.226 --> 38:02.159
And if it wasn't with
the skull, maybe the killer

38:02.195 --> 38:03.961
didn't clean it off.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.066
We found your skin cells

38:09.102 --> 38:11.802
on the skull that you slammed
into Sarah's head.

38:11.838 --> 38:13.371
I touched the thing.

38:13.406 --> 38:15.573
I-I went with her to
dig it up. So what?

38:15.608 --> 38:17.675
You sure a jury's
going to buy that?

38:17.710 --> 38:19.610
I think I need to
talk to a lawyer.

38:19.646 --> 38:23.014
Just relax.
Slow down, Joel, okay?

38:23.049 --> 38:24.715
Why don't you tell us
what happened that night.

38:24.751 --> 38:26.284
What night are you
talking about?

38:26.319 --> 38:27.818
The night that Sarah died,

38:27.854 --> 38:29.954
she got two vials of drugs,

38:29.989 --> 38:32.623
enough to match
your body weight.

38:32.659 --> 38:34.392
You lied to us.

38:34.427 --> 38:36.460
Sarah didn't change because

38:36.496 --> 38:38.195
you rubbed off on her--
she changed

38:38.231 --> 38:40.731
after she saw the other side.

38:40.767 --> 38:43.334
Whatever she saw
changed her life,

38:43.369 --> 38:46.504
and she wanted you
to experience the same thing.

38:48.308 --> 38:50.675
Okay, okay, I lied.

38:50.710 --> 38:52.810
All right, but not
because I killed her.

38:52.845 --> 38:55.146
I didn't want to get kicked
out of the program.

38:55.181 --> 38:57.915
I have a close friend who went
through something similar.

38:57.950 --> 38:59.684
He died...

38:59.719 --> 39:01.986
came back.

39:02.021 --> 39:03.888
Everything changed for him.

39:03.923 --> 39:05.790
He was never the same.

39:05.825 --> 39:07.325
Is that what happened
to you, Joel?

39:08.461 --> 39:11.028
It's not like I really died.

39:11.064 --> 39:12.496
(stammers)

39:12.532 --> 39:14.432
I was only out
for a few seconds.

39:14.467 --> 39:15.666
It wasn't that big a deal.

39:15.702 --> 39:17.802
Okay, we found this picture

39:17.837 --> 39:19.637
of you and her.

39:19.672 --> 39:21.038
You're wearing your cross
in that picture,

39:21.074 --> 39:23.207
and now you're not
wearing that.

39:23.242 --> 39:25.643
You stop believing,
or something?

39:25.678 --> 39:27.378
What did you see?

39:27.413 --> 39:29.780
What did you see
on the other side?

39:34.921 --> 39:36.620
Nothing.

39:36.656 --> 39:39.490
Nothing happened.

39:40.593 --> 39:43.527
She said it would be amazing.

39:45.064 --> 39:47.231
I always had faith,

39:47.266 --> 39:49.600
but there was nothing.

39:49.635 --> 39:51.475
I mean, how are you supposed
to live with that,

39:51.504 --> 39:53.738
knowing that
there's nothing after?

39:53.773 --> 39:56.207
She took your faith away,
didn't she?

39:57.343 --> 39:58.843
And you killed her.

She was holding
that stupid skull

40:03.516 --> 40:05.416
and I just...

40:05.451 --> 40:07.051
I snapped.

Before I knew it, she was gone.

40:26.406 --> 40:28.205
Cheers.

40:28.241 --> 40:29.673
To new friends. Mm.
New friends.

40:29.709 --> 40:32.643
Together we accomplished
the impossible.

40:32.678 --> 40:34.245
Uh, no,
there's nothing impossible

40:34.280 --> 40:35.613
about solving a murder.

40:35.648 --> 40:37.515
It's merely a matter
of proper application

40:37.550 --> 40:39.550
of the scientific method.

40:39.585 --> 40:41.619
I was referring to the
four of us getting along.

40:41.654 --> 40:44.889
I... thought that
it would happen eventually.

40:44.924 --> 40:48.726
I must return
to the Jeffersonian

40:48.761 --> 40:52.062
to prepare General Howe's
remains for transport.

40:52.098 --> 40:53.164
You know, I gotta
get going, too.

40:53.199 --> 40:54.632
I got some work
I got to do.

40:54.667 --> 40:55.800
It was a pleasure
meeting you, Agent Mills,

40:55.835 --> 40:57.034
and working with you.

40:57.069 --> 40:58.569
If you need anything,
you call me.

40:58.604 --> 41:00.104
I can't replace August,
but I'll do my best.

41:00.139 --> 41:02.039
Agent Booth, I hope we get
a chance to do it again.

Mm. (chuckles)

41:07.079 --> 41:08.379
Right.

41:08.414 --> 41:10.247
Okay.

41:13.619 --> 41:16.320
(sighing):
Well...

41:16.355 --> 41:19.256
Oh, that is potent.

41:19.292 --> 41:22.460
I believe Franklin once
gave me a similar concoction.

41:22.495 --> 41:24.962
Benjamin Franklin invented
"Sex on the Beach"?

41:24.997 --> 41:28.432
He called it
"Fondled in the Forest," but...

41:28.468 --> 41:29.733
(laughs)

41:29.769 --> 41:31.769
Now you're just
making things up.

BRAY:
Dr. Brennan.

Uh, General Howe's remains are
ready for your final signature

41:44.650 --> 41:46.016
before being transported
back to Sleepy Hollow.

41:46.052 --> 41:47.551
That is unacceptable.

41:47.587 --> 41:50.120
I signed off on Howe's remains
a short while ago.

41:50.156 --> 41:51.396
They were to be shipped by now.

You did not "get me."

I got you, I got you.

You were scared.
I told you I'd get you back.

42:14.313 --> 42:16.146
I was not scared,
I was surprised.

42:16.182 --> 42:17.414
Oh, is there a difference?

42:17.450 --> 42:18.482
Of course there's a difference.

42:18.518 --> 42:20.150
The amygdala is wired to

42:20.186 --> 42:21.519
activate a flow
of adrenaline

42:21.554 --> 42:23.487
at the sight of
something unexpected.

42:23.523 --> 42:25.623
That is quite different
than being afraid.

You can't science your way
out of this, Bones.

fire Mr. Bray.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.734
Fire him?
Yes.

42:36.769 --> 42:38.068
As a prank.

42:38.104 --> 42:39.837
I... He assisted
in your prank,

42:39.872 --> 42:42.406
so it's only appropriate
that I prank him back.

42:42.441 --> 42:43.841
That's not a good prank.
(laughing)

42:43.876 --> 42:45.476
I'll tell him...

42:45.511 --> 42:47.344

Eventually?

42:47.380 --> 42:49.413
A year.
Whoa, wait a second.
