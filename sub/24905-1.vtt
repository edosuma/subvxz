01:54.449 --> 02:00.355
A FANTASTIC WOMAN

03:27.709 --> 03:29.836
<i>- Ménica?
- Yes?</i>

03:30.003 --> 03:33.506
Have you seen a big, white envelope
I left on my desk?

03:33.673 --> 03:36.175
<i>No, Mr. Orlando, I haven't.</i>

03:36.342 --> 03:37.844
Thanks.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.393
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.354
Can I have some paper
and an envelope?

04:29.520 --> 04:31.731
Sure, let me see.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.321
Great.

05:08.101 --> 05:12.146
<i>Your love is like
yesterday's newspaper</i>

05:12.772 --> 05:17.360
<i>No one wants to
read it anymore</i>

05:17.819 --> 05:22.448
<i>Sensational when it was published
In the morning</i>

05:22.865 --> 05:27.412
<i>Reports are confirmed by midday</i>

05:28.037 --> 05:32.875
<i>By afternoon
The story's forgotten</i>

05:33.292 --> 05:36.963
<i>Your love is like
yesterday's newspaper</i>

05:38.006 --> 05:42.552
<i>Its headlines filled
the front page</i>

05:43.136 --> 05:47.807
<i>So you're known everywhere</i>

05:48.266 --> 05:52.645
<i>I cut out your
name and kept it</i>

05:53.271 --> 05:57.775
<i>Pasting it into my
album of oblivion</i>

05:58.568 --> 06:03.156
<i>Your love is like
yesterday's newspaper</i>

06:06.659 --> 06:11.539
<i>And what's the point
Of reading yesterday's paper?</i>

06:11.706 --> 06:15.251
<i>News that everyone knows</i>

06:15.418 --> 06:18.546
<i>And which I don't want to read</i>

06:21.632 --> 06:25.261
<i>You were good for nothing, baby</i>

06:25.428 --> 06:27.263
<i>So I threw you in the trash</i>

06:31.726 --> 06:35.521
<i>I had you, I loved you
I supported you</i>

06:35.688 --> 06:38.608
<i>But I no longer love you
No longer love you</i>

06:53.122 --> 06:55.374
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

06:55.541 --> 06:58.002
I reserved for "Orlando Onetto."

06:58.169 --> 07:00.254
One second.

07:05.760 --> 07:10.181
Yes, that's right. Table 41.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.768
- Thanks.
- Follow me.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.294
Thank you, Orlando.

07:41.462 --> 07:44.132
- Thank you!
- I'll bring out some slices.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.716
Thank you.

07:52.515 --> 07:53.891
Thanks, love.

07:54.058 --> 07:57.186
A musical cake and everything!

08:04.694 --> 08:06.070
Here.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.531
How formal.

08:15.121 --> 08:18.291
"Valid for two trips to Iguazú Falls."

08:20.001 --> 08:22.378
- Orlando!
- It's no small thing.

08:22.545 --> 08:25.298
It's one of the Natural Wonders
of the World.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.049
Wow!

08:27.466 --> 08:28.968
When do we go?

08:29.135 --> 08:30.928
In 10 days.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.181
In 10 days?

08:42.940 --> 08:45.151
And why "valid for"?

08:45.818 --> 08:48.446
It's a long story.

08:49.030 --> 08:50.907
You haven't bought them yet?

08:51.073 --> 08:53.659
Yes, I bought them,
printed them out...

08:53.826 --> 08:55.953
...and put them in an envelope.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.788
And then?

08:57.955 --> 09:00.750
I had them at the sauna.

09:00.917 --> 09:02.543
And?

09:03.836 --> 09:06.464
I don't remember where
the fuck I put them.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.718
Poor, senile old man.

09:18.226 --> 09:19.995
<i>Goodbye, my friend</i>

09:20.019 --> 09:22.605
<i>Who knows when
We shall meet</i>

09:22.772 --> 09:28.361
<i>The stars wait for me</i>

09:29.403 --> 09:35.284
<i>Who knows where
We shall meet again</i>

09:38.829 --> 09:41.874
<i>If ever</i>

09:43.668 --> 09:46.671
<i>But time</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:53.678
<i>Keeps flowing like a river</i>

09:53.844 --> 09:56.514
<i>On and on</i>

09:56.722 --> 10:01.560
<i>To the sea</i>

10:02.478 --> 10:08.025
<i>To the sea</i>

10:08.985 --> 10:12.794
<i>Till it's gone</i>

10:12.820 --> 10:16.567
<i>forever</i>

10:16.742 --> 10:22.690
<i>Gone forever</i>

10:36.929 --> 10:40.016
We'll have to ask the
doorman for help.

12:07.436 --> 12:09.355
Orlando?

12:17.196 --> 12:19.448
- Orlando, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.618
"I don't know"?

12:25.955 --> 12:28.374
I don't know what's wrong with me.

12:32.753 --> 12:36.257
What the fuck is wrong?
Get up. Come on.

12:38.676 --> 12:40.302
Honey.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.139
What's wrong with you?

12:47.601 --> 12:50.479
Lean against the wall. Here.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.148
Look at me.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.858
Here.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.239
Do you have the keys?

13:00.406 --> 13:01.991
No.

13:06.579 --> 13:08.372
Wait here.

13:15.296 --> 13:18.757
No, Diabla, stop that!
Come here!

13:18.924 --> 13:20.593
Diabla!

13:44.533 --> 13:47.620
Orlando, honey!

13:53.626 --> 13:55.669
- Let's go!
- I'm fine.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.467
Talk to me, honey. Okay?

14:01.634 --> 14:03.260
Talk to me!

14:05.387 --> 14:06.889
Please!

14:07.056 --> 14:08.766
Talk to me!

14:10.851 --> 14:12.686
Where are we going?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.981
To the hospital, Orlando, where else?

14:16.148 --> 14:17.733
Focus, okay?

14:22.613 --> 14:23.822
Hurry.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.407
What?

14:25.574 --> 14:27.576
Hurry up.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.912
I will, honey.

14:41.966 --> 14:44.385
Help me, please!

14:47.179 --> 14:49.598
Easy, ma'am. We've got him.

14:49.765 --> 14:52.476
You okay? What's your name?
Can you hear me?

14:52.643 --> 14:54.895
Juan Pablo, hurry up!

14:58.315 --> 14:59.817
Careful, careful!

14:59.984 --> 15:01.777
One, two, three.

15:04.363 --> 15:07.533
- What's your name? Can you hear me?
- His name is Orlando.

15:07.700 --> 15:10.286
- What happened?
- I don't know!

15:10.452 --> 15:13.038
- Is he on medication?
- No.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.708
- How old is he?
- Fifty-seven.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.085
Hurry up, he's not responding!

15:19.503 --> 15:21.046
Did he feel sick?

15:21.213 --> 15:24.383
He woke up with a headache
and was acting strange.

15:24.550 --> 15:28.387
- When?
- Maybe 15 or 20 minutes ago.

15:29.096 --> 15:33.017
Unconscious male patient, 57,
hemorrhage on the left side.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.477
Frontal contusion.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.525
Ready? One, two, three.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.404
Graciela, call the doctor.
Pass the scissors.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.990
- Watch his pulse.
- Careful of his shirt.

15:48.157 --> 15:51.327
- Miss, you have to go.
- I brought him as fast as I could.

15:51.493 --> 15:54.246
Please wait outside.
We'll take care of him.

15:54.413 --> 15:56.165
Stay calm.

15:57.416 --> 15:59.126
Go, go.

17:02.314 --> 17:05.567
- Are you a family member?
- No, I brought him in.

17:06.609 --> 17:10.155
- So you don't know him?
- Yes, we're friends.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.493
These are his things.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.539
They can't be in there.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.502
How is he?

17:24.461 --> 17:26.088
They'll let you know.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.549
Just wait a bit.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.957
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

18:05.085 --> 18:08.130
So are you a member
of Mr. Onetto's family?

18:08.297 --> 18:09.715
Yes.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.094
- Are you his partner?
- Yes, we're partners.

18:14.428 --> 18:17.473
- Sorry, your name is...?
- Marina Vidal.

18:19.683 --> 18:22.686
But that's a nickname?

18:23.562 --> 18:25.189
Excuse me?

18:28.108 --> 18:29.985
Could you come with me...

18:30.152 --> 18:32.696
...to talk in private?

18:34.198 --> 18:36.241
Is something wrong?

18:36.408 --> 18:39.411
No, I'd like to talk to you.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.957
- But is there a problem?
- No.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.626
This way.

19:44.309 --> 19:45.811
<i>Orlando?</i>

19:45.978 --> 19:48.188
I'm Orlando's friend.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.817
<i>- With whom am I speaking?
- With Marina.</i>

19:51.984 --> 19:54.486
<i>- I'm...
- Yes, I know who you are, ma'am.</i>

19:54.653 --> 19:57.906
The thing is,
Orlando started feeling sick.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.658
<i>When?</i>

20:00.742 --> 20:03.745
About an hour and a half ago.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.914
I brought him to the hospital, but...

20:06.081 --> 20:07.916
<i>Which hospital?</i>

20:08.500 --> 20:10.586
Saint Thomas.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.506
And he collapsed in the car.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.927
<i>- And he died.
- He died?</i>

20:19.094 --> 20:21.054
Yes, just now.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.557
The doctor says it was an aneurysm.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.684
I'm very sorry.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.860
<i>Yes, I'm here.</i>

20:37.029 --> 20:41.158
<i>- You haven't called anyone else, right?
- No, no one.</i>

20:42.242 --> 20:43.452
<i>Fine.</i>

20:43.619 --> 20:48.040
But I need someone to come here.
I can't take care of this.

20:48.749 --> 20:51.793
<i>Don't worry.
I'll tell the family.</i>

20:52.294 --> 20:54.129
<i>Don't call anyone.</i>

22:29.182 --> 22:30.642
Miss Marina Vidal?

22:30.809 --> 22:33.353
- Yes, what is it?
- Come with me, please.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.818
Sergeant.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.403
Thank you.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.071
Excuse me.

22:43.739 --> 22:47.159
You didn't have to treat me
like a criminal.

22:51.288 --> 22:53.915
I'll leave you to your work.

22:54.958 --> 22:57.294
Miss, I need your details.

22:57.461 --> 23:00.088
- Here?
- Here.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.132
Full name.

23:02.299 --> 23:03.925
Marina.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.931
Do you have your ID card?

23:26.198 --> 23:28.742
It's still pending, sir.

23:28.909 --> 23:32.454
Until it has changed,
this is still your legal name.

23:33.705 --> 23:35.874
My name is Marina Vidal.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.460
Do you have a problem with that?

23:38.627 --> 23:40.587
Why did you run off?

23:42.297 --> 23:45.801
- Why am I being detained?
- You're not being detained, sir.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.053
So why do you have my ID card?

23:49.137 --> 23:50.764
Evening.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.850
Marina?

23:56.478 --> 23:59.898
Thanks for everything.
Sorry you had to go through this.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.942
I'm Gabo.

24:02.818 --> 24:04.277
Hello, Gabo.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.987
How are you?

24:06.154 --> 24:07.531
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:07.697 --> 24:09.116
- How are you?
- Hello.

24:09.282 --> 24:12.702
Gabriel Onetto,
brother of the deceased.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.206
Is something wrong?

24:16.373 --> 24:17.833
No, everything is fine.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.921
He brought him and left in a hurry,
but we needed to speak to him.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.673
You can speak to me.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.467
I'm his family.
I'll take care of this.

24:28.760 --> 24:32.764
You must understand that the young lady
was with my brother when he died...

24:32.931 --> 24:36.059
...so it's a sensitive situation.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.190
Thank you.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.651
Your telephone number, please.

24:47.154 --> 24:48.780
Nine...

24:49.865 --> 24:51.950
...814...

24:52.117 --> 24:53.618
...95...

24:53.785 --> 24:55.662
...75.

25:56.181 --> 25:59.184
Marina! We need you here!

25:59.351 --> 26:01.061
I'm coming!

26:08.068 --> 26:10.362
- Everything all right?
- Yes, thank you.

26:10.528 --> 26:13.990
- Excuse me, could I have some water?
- Yes.

26:18.787 --> 26:22.249
You didn't want to come,
and I was calling you for the night shift.

26:22.415 --> 26:23.458
Damn.

26:24.292 --> 26:28.713
I couldn't check my phone, Alessandra.
The celebration was intense.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.925
But you came. I appreciate that.

26:33.385 --> 26:36.596
- Do you need anything?
- No. Everything's fine.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.224
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

26:40.809 --> 26:42.686
Always so mysterious.

26:43.186 --> 26:44.938
It's been ringing for a while.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.690
Thanks.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.403
I'll be right back.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.248
<i>This is Sonia.</i>

27:03.832 --> 27:05.250
<i>The wife... I mean...</i>

27:05.417 --> 27:07.419
<i>Ex-wife of Orlando.</i>

27:07.585 --> 27:09.879
I know.
How are you, ma'am?

27:10.046 --> 27:12.757
<i>First of all,
there's no need to be so formal.</i>

27:12.924 --> 27:17.679
<i>I talked to Gabo. He said you're living
in Orlando's apartment. Is that right?</i>

27:17.846 --> 27:19.931
Yes, it's true.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.434
<i>Well, I need his car.</i>

27:22.600 --> 27:24.227
Of course.

27:25.061 --> 27:28.189
<i>- You could've left it with Gabo.
- He didn't want it.</i>

27:28.356 --> 27:33.028
Ma'am... I mean, Sonia. Tell me
when you need it and I'll drop it off.

27:33.194 --> 27:37.407
<i>Let's see... Tomorrow.
Could you drop it off at my office?</i>

27:37.574 --> 27:40.368
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

27:40.535 --> 27:44.831
<i>Leave it in the parking lot.
Just ask, and they'll tell you where.</i>

27:45.623 --> 27:48.126
<i>At 10:30? Is that okay?</i>

27:48.293 --> 27:49.961
I'll make it work.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.464
<i>Anything else of his that you have?</i>

27:52.630 --> 27:53.840
No.

27:54.007 --> 27:56.176
Just personal things.

27:57.260 --> 28:00.764
<i>We'll have to work out
what to do with the apartment too.</i>

28:01.264 --> 28:02.849
Of course.

28:03.016 --> 28:06.853
<i>I want you to handle
all practical affairs with me.</i>

28:08.313 --> 28:12.150
Can we talk about that when we meet?
I'm at work right now.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.324
- Can you bring the check?
- Right away.

28:19.491 --> 28:20.909
I'll be right back.

28:21.076 --> 28:22.911
Marina, someone's here for you.

28:23.078 --> 28:24.913
- Who?
- I don't know.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.582
- Where?
- At the entrance.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.174
Good afternoon, Marina.

28:36.341 --> 28:39.177
Thanks for coming out.
It'll just be two minutes.

28:39.344 --> 28:40.929
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.931
I'm Detective Adriana Cortés...

28:43.098 --> 28:46.684
...from the Investigative Police's
Sexual Offenses Unit.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.436
Good afternoon.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.688
First, I want to
offer my condolences.

28:50.855 --> 28:54.275
They told me what happened.
I'm really sorry.

28:54.943 --> 28:58.113
The fact that you ran away
from the hospital...

28:58.279 --> 29:00.532
...really concerned me.

29:01.366 --> 29:02.992
Could we talk there?

29:03.159 --> 29:05.662
- Of course.
- Please.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.833
I didn't run away.

29:11.543 --> 29:14.170
There must be some mistake, then.

29:14.796 --> 29:17.924
Could I see your ID, please?

29:22.387 --> 29:23.430
One question:

29:24.681 --> 29:25.890
Mr. Orlando...

29:26.057 --> 29:28.017
- Onetto.
- Yes.

29:28.184 --> 29:29.686
Was he paying you?

29:29.853 --> 29:31.688
We were a couple.

29:33.857 --> 29:36.609
So you cared for each other.
It wasn't just sexual.

29:36.776 --> 29:40.405
It was a healthy, consensual relationship
between two adults.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.991
Why do you ask?

29:43.783 --> 29:46.286
He was old enough to be your father.

29:48.037 --> 29:50.874
Did you consume drugs
before his seizure?

29:51.249 --> 29:53.460
- No.
- Alcohol?

29:53.626 --> 29:55.128
Yes.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.714
Did you have sex?

29:59.632 --> 30:01.634
I don't remember.

30:04.095 --> 30:08.266
I need to know if he suffered
any physical stress.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.435
Nothing unusual.

30:11.895 --> 30:14.522
The thing is,
Mr. Onetto's body...

30:14.689 --> 30:17.400
...arrived with injuries, bruises.

30:18.443 --> 30:22.071
He suffered blows to his arms,
sides and neck.

30:23.198 --> 30:25.408
And had a contusion on his head.

30:31.039 --> 30:32.874
The injuries were fresh.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.252
I talked to the doctor
about all of this.

30:36.669 --> 30:38.630
Did you talk to his family?

30:40.965 --> 30:44.052
Excuse me.
It's about the check for Table 15.

30:44.219 --> 30:47.680
- I'll be right there.
- Five minutes, please.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.559
- Can't they cover for you?
- No.

30:51.726 --> 30:54.854
I need to get back,
or they'll fire me.

30:56.940 --> 31:00.360
Look, I've been working on
the streets for 23 years.

31:01.277 --> 31:05.573
Fourteen years in Sexual Offenses,
and I have a master's degree in it.

31:05.740 --> 31:10.286
I know very well what happens
to people... Sorry, women like you.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.997
I've seen everything.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.833
Everything.

31:18.878 --> 31:22.048
I want you to know
I understand and support you.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.720
Did you have to defend
yourself from him?

31:29.722 --> 31:31.516
- Am I being arrested?
- No.

31:31.683 --> 31:35.186
- Then I'm going because...
- Wait, let's do this.

31:37.855 --> 31:40.483
Call me when you're done,
so we can talk properly...

31:40.650 --> 31:43.027
...and I can sleep well, all right?

31:44.821 --> 31:46.823
Talk about what?

31:47.490 --> 31:49.659
I'll be waiting for you.

31:50.535 --> 31:53.162
It'll be best if you
don't leave Santiago.

31:53.746 --> 31:54.789
Okay, bye.

31:54.956 --> 31:57.375
Bye, Marina. Thanks, nice place!

31:57.542 --> 31:59.002
Thanks.

32:00.712 --> 32:02.297
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

32:02.463 --> 32:06.009
- Did you notice I tried to save you?
- Yes, I did. Thanks.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.261
Will you tell me
what the fuck's going on?

32:08.428 --> 32:11.306
Some other time?
I've had a terrible day.

32:11.472 --> 32:12.849
Sure.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.241
Diabla.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.252
Hey, you.

34:58.681 --> 35:02.226
<i>Marina, this is Detective Cortés.</i>

35:02.894 --> 35:08.065
<i>You must have a good reason
to stand up an investigating officer.</i>

35:08.232 --> 35:09.942
<i>Now, I won't ask.</i>

35:10.109 --> 35:13.780
<i>Instead, I demand that you
come in and talk to me tomorrow.</i>

35:14.405 --> 35:17.992
<i>I'll be at Forensic Medical Services.
Look for me when you get there.</i>

35:18.159 --> 35:20.745
<i>See you at 12:30.</i>

35:21.245 --> 35:23.664
<i>Don't call me. No excuses.</i>

35:23.831 --> 35:25.750
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

35:25.917 --> 35:29.128
<i>Please don't make me send
someone to pick you up.</i>

36:58.384 --> 36:59.802
Diabla.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.263
Up, up!

37:06.809 --> 37:08.561
Are you Marisa?

37:08.728 --> 37:10.229
Marina.

37:11.731 --> 37:13.065
I'm Bruno.

37:19.071 --> 37:20.656
Sorry...

37:20.823 --> 37:22.867
...I thought no one was here.

37:50.186 --> 37:52.897
What happened, Marisa?

37:55.775 --> 37:58.277
Your dad suddenly felt sick.

37:59.070 --> 38:00.947
It all happened so fast.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.496
What were you doing?

38:08.663 --> 38:10.581
Sleeping.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.459
That's all?

38:14.919 --> 38:18.047
You were with him and he died?
Just like that?

38:22.093 --> 38:24.303
We rushed to the hospital.

38:26.097 --> 38:27.723
His body was bruised.

38:29.892 --> 38:32.770
Why the fuck was his body bruised?

38:35.731 --> 38:36.774
And his head injured.

38:40.695 --> 38:43.739
He fell down the stairs
as we were going down.

38:44.490 --> 38:45.783
That's why.

38:49.912 --> 38:51.998
And those suitcases?

38:54.375 --> 38:56.419
I was moving in.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.218
Fuck.

39:11.726 --> 39:14.729
What will we do with you, Diabla?

39:17.773 --> 39:19.775
Orlando gave her to me.

39:20.443 --> 39:22.945
- I'm sorry.
- He gave you Diabla?

39:25.239 --> 39:27.158
Fucking hell.

39:27.867 --> 39:29.410
Look...

39:29.952 --> 39:32.163
...I slept next to Diabla...

39:32.329 --> 39:34.290
...for years.

39:34.457 --> 39:36.542
But I had to stop.

39:38.753 --> 39:41.088
I didn't like the smell.

39:46.802 --> 39:49.930
Did you know there are
two kinds of pet owners?

39:50.681 --> 39:55.269
Those who have mammals and
those who prefer birds or reptiles.

39:56.896 --> 39:59.774
We mammals have a neocortex...

39:59.940 --> 40:02.401
...the most developed layer
of neural tissue...

40:02.568 --> 40:04.820
...where emotions are generated.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.281
That's where empathy...

40:07.448 --> 40:09.408
...tenderness...

40:10.117 --> 40:11.702
...and love are generated.

40:12.578 --> 40:16.957
I don't see anyone with a lizard.
I don't get your analysis.

40:17.124 --> 40:20.294
- What are you saying?
- I'm not saying anything.

40:23.297 --> 40:25.174
Did you get the operation?

40:25.800 --> 40:27.134
You don't ask that.

40:27.301 --> 40:28.969
Why not?

40:29.136 --> 40:30.971
I don't know what you are.

40:31.138 --> 40:32.723
I'm the same as you.

40:32.890 --> 40:34.934
Yeah, sure.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.856
Can we talk another time?

40:41.023 --> 40:43.859
Wait, wait, wait.

40:44.026 --> 40:47.571
I just need to know when
you're leaving this apartment.

40:48.239 --> 40:50.658
When I find something,
I'll let you all know.

40:50.825 --> 40:53.536
- How much time are we talking?
- A few weeks.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.080
No, not a few weeks.

40:56.247 --> 40:58.374
Tell me a date,
or I'll kick you out.

40:58.541 --> 41:00.376
Know what?
Get out of my house.

41:00.543 --> 41:02.920
This isn't your house.

41:07.508 --> 41:09.552
Incredible.

41:12.138 --> 41:14.431
My dad was crazy.

41:19.979 --> 41:22.898
If you steal anything, I'll know.

41:26.110 --> 41:27.820
Hey, Bruno!

41:28.988 --> 41:30.614
My name is Marina.

41:30.781 --> 41:32.158
Bye.

42:50.903 --> 42:52.780
Miss?

42:53.197 --> 42:54.782
Hey, miss!

42:57.785 --> 42:59.495
I'll pay for the wash.

42:59.662 --> 43:01.747
You need a coffee.

43:05.292 --> 43:07.378
Give me an espresso.

43:09.380 --> 43:11.131
How would you like it?

43:13.801 --> 43:15.594
Double.

43:15.761 --> 43:19.348
<i>Lord, it made me feel so tired</i>

43:21.100 --> 43:22.101
<i>Before the day</i>

43:24.645 --> 43:26.230
Idiot.

43:27.231 --> 43:31.151
<i>You're the key to
my peace of mind</i>

43:32.027 --> 43:33.904
<i>'Cause you make me feel</i>

43:35.239 --> 43:38.158
<i>You make me feel</i>

43:38.367 --> 43:44.332
<i>You make me feel
Like a natural woman</i>

43:45.040 --> 43:46.583
<i>Woman</i>

43:47.751 --> 43:51.505
<i>When my soul
Was in the lost and found</i>

43:53.966 --> 43:57.928
<i>You came along to claim it</i>

43:59.471 --> 44:01.098
- Hi, good morning.
- Good morning.

44:01.265 --> 44:04.310
I'm bringing this car to Sonia...
I don't know her last name.

44:04.476 --> 44:05.769
Sonia Bunster.

44:05.936 --> 44:08.188
She said to tell her
when you arrived.

44:08.355 --> 44:11.358
Please park on Level 4,
Parking Space 5.

44:11.525 --> 44:13.944
She'll come and pick up the car.

44:14.111 --> 44:18.115
- She wants me to wait down there?
- Yes, she said so.

44:18.282 --> 44:21.118
- Thanks.
- You're welcome, go ahead.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.874
<i>'Cause you make me feel</i>

44:27.082 --> 44:30.127
<i>You make me feel</i>

44:30.336 --> 44:36.292
<i>You make me feel
Like a natural woman</i>

44:36.800 --> 44:38.302
<i>Woman</i>

45:02.451 --> 45:03.535
Hello.

45:04.661 --> 45:06.330
Hello, Sonia.

45:08.916 --> 45:10.751
Oh, I'm sorry.

45:10.918 --> 45:13.420
- Hello.
- How are you?

45:14.338 --> 45:17.841
I've been wondering
how you look for about a year.

45:18.509 --> 45:20.803
It's different face-to-face.

45:20.969 --> 45:22.596
Of course.

45:22.763 --> 45:24.598
As you can see, ma'am:

45:25.057 --> 45:26.308
Flesh and bones.

45:26.475 --> 45:28.310
Yes, it's just that...

45:29.478 --> 45:33.357
...I can't imagine Orlando being with you.
That's all.

45:35.567 --> 45:37.569
And don't call me "ma'am."

45:42.032 --> 45:43.951
- Here are the car keys.
- Thanks.

45:44.118 --> 45:45.911
The documents are in
the glove compartment.

45:46.078 --> 45:49.081
- Okay. Excuse me.
- Yes.

45:50.791 --> 45:52.668
Complicated.

45:56.922 --> 45:58.632
Really complicated.

45:58.799 --> 46:01.385
Total quantum physics.

46:26.618 --> 46:29.788
I won't talk about
the apartment now, but...

46:33.000 --> 46:37.004
Try to hand it over as soon
as you can, okay? Hand it over.

46:37.171 --> 46:39.798
- That's it.
- Thanks.

46:41.592 --> 46:44.720
Sonia, I'm really sorry
about all of this.

46:44.887 --> 46:46.805
What are you sorry about?

46:46.972 --> 46:50.434
The entire soap opera,
or this episode in particular?

46:50.601 --> 46:53.228
No, about how things turned out.

46:54.271 --> 46:55.772
Yeah.

46:58.650 --> 47:01.737
You know, when I married Orlando...

47:01.904 --> 47:03.822
...I was 38.

47:03.989 --> 47:06.366
And we were really normal.
We were...

47:07.659 --> 47:09.870
We had a normal life.

47:13.248 --> 47:15.334
So when he...

47:16.126 --> 47:18.754
...came and explained to me...

47:19.379 --> 47:20.464
...I...

47:23.342 --> 47:24.551
I thought...

47:28.222 --> 47:31.683
Sorry if it's crude
and blunt of me to say this...

47:31.850 --> 47:35.812
...but I really think that
this is just perversion.

47:40.901 --> 47:42.444
Sorry, but...

47:45.989 --> 47:49.284
When I look at you,
I don't know what I'm seeing.

47:57.417 --> 48:00.337
A chimera, that's what I see.

48:00.963 --> 48:02.714
A chimera.

48:11.181 --> 48:12.724
Sorry.

48:15.727 --> 48:17.938
There's no need to be sorry.

48:19.523 --> 48:21.316
You're normal, ma'am.

48:23.318 --> 48:25.237
You're fine, ma'am.

48:45.215 --> 48:47.426
- Hello.
- Hello.

48:51.388 --> 48:53.307
- Hello, Sonia.
- Hello, Pablo.

48:53.473 --> 48:56.226
- How are you?
- Me, I'm fine. And you?

48:56.393 --> 48:58.228
Fine, thanks.

48:58.395 --> 48:59.813
Great.

49:05.777 --> 49:07.404
Thanks.

49:24.671 --> 49:26.173
- Bye.
- Bye.

49:26.340 --> 49:30.302
You know my 7-year-old daughter
will be at the wake this afternoon?

49:30.469 --> 49:31.928
Yes.

49:32.429 --> 49:35.057
And I'd love to know where it'll be.

49:36.016 --> 49:38.101
I know how to be discreet.

49:38.268 --> 49:40.479
Don't even think about going.

49:41.480 --> 49:43.690
I have the right to say
goodbye to him too.

49:43.857 --> 49:46.068
Look, it's my problem now.

49:47.194 --> 49:51.698
You already had a hard time.
Now the formalities are my part.

49:51.865 --> 49:54.910
And I want to compensate you
for everything you've done.

49:55.077 --> 49:56.620
Really, so you can relax.

49:56.787 --> 49:59.915
You don't need to go
anywhere or do anything.

50:00.082 --> 50:04.711
And we'll handle this in a civilized way,
so we're both satisfied.

50:04.878 --> 50:07.506
I don't need your money, ma'am.

50:08.715 --> 50:10.217
Did you call the police?

50:14.388 --> 50:15.889
No.

50:18.558 --> 50:21.019
Well, in any case, I apologize.

50:21.186 --> 50:24.648
I'm just looking out for
my loved ones, that's all.

50:25.440 --> 50:27.025
Orlando was a loved one to me.

50:27.192 --> 50:29.986
Yes, but you won't go
to the funeral or wake.

50:30.612 --> 50:31.863
Understood?

50:32.030 --> 50:34.282
I don't know how to explain it.
What can I say?

50:34.449 --> 50:39.246
Daniel, you are not going to
the funeral or anywhere else.

50:39.788 --> 50:41.331
Please!

50:41.498 --> 50:46.420
Let us mourn as a family,
like it's meant to be. Don't show up.

50:47.045 --> 50:48.755
I'm asking you as a mother.

50:48.922 --> 50:53.093
Remember, there's an entire
family devastated, in shock.

50:58.640 --> 51:02.394
I'd give my life for my daughter,
if I had to.

51:26.376 --> 51:28.462
Adriana, I want to apologize
for not calling...

51:28.628 --> 51:31.465
- Detective Cortés.
- Detective.

51:31.631 --> 51:35.385
I want to apologize for not calling
last night, but I was overwhelmed.

51:35.552 --> 51:38.263
- I took sleeping pills.
- Don't worry about it.

51:38.430 --> 51:40.015
Let's go.

51:42.684 --> 51:44.603
This way, please.

51:45.604 --> 51:49.149
- Will we see Orlando's body?
- No.

51:49.608 --> 51:52.736
I booked a room.
If I'm late, I'll be in trouble.

51:53.487 --> 51:55.447
What do you need?

51:55.614 --> 51:57.449
Well, because you didn't call me...

51:57.616 --> 52:00.827
...I went over our conversation yesterday.

52:01.620 --> 52:06.750
The toxicology test came
back positive for alcohol.

52:06.917 --> 52:08.752
And marijuana.

52:09.586 --> 52:11.296
Where are we going?

52:11.963 --> 52:14.925
We're giving you a
physical examination.

52:15.091 --> 52:16.843
No. No way.

52:17.010 --> 52:19.679
It'll take five minutes.
It'll be superficial. Let's go, please.

52:19.846 --> 52:23.350
- But you didn't tell me.
- Marina, I went to see you yesterday.

52:23.517 --> 52:24.726
I was very concerned.

52:24.893 --> 52:29.898
And you said you'd call me after work,
you promised.

52:30.065 --> 52:33.193
And you stood me up,
like I was crazy.

52:33.860 --> 52:35.779
I'm sorry, it's just...

52:36.279 --> 52:40.158
I took some pills and fell asleep.
And the marijuana...

52:40.325 --> 52:43.328
I need to confirm that you
don't have any injuries.

52:43.495 --> 52:46.706
- But I don't have any injuries.
- So there's no problem.

52:54.339 --> 52:55.841
What?

52:56.758 --> 52:58.552
Why are you doing this to me?

52:58.718 --> 53:00.887
It's what's done.

53:01.054 --> 53:04.015
It's called a
"possible injury evaluation."

53:05.100 --> 53:07.018
Well, I refuse.

53:08.353 --> 53:09.646
Fine.

53:10.564 --> 53:13.608
Then I'll ask the district attorney
to open a case...

53:13.775 --> 53:16.194
...on the death of Mr. Onetto.

53:16.820 --> 53:19.906
Look, if we find nothing,
this ends here.

53:20.615 --> 53:22.659
You go on with your life.

53:23.076 --> 53:24.828
You decide.

53:31.918 --> 53:35.338
I'll close this so you're comfortable.

53:40.218 --> 53:43.763
Thanks for your help.
You saved me.

53:43.930 --> 53:45.140
We're even now, then.

53:45.307 --> 53:47.559
You said his name is Daniel.
How should I treat him?

53:47.726 --> 53:50.937
Don't call her Daniel.
Treat her like a woman.

53:51.104 --> 53:55.400
Ask her what her name is.
But use her female name.

53:55.567 --> 53:57.611
What did she do?

53:57.777 --> 54:00.989
I don't know.
That's why we're here.

54:01.907 --> 54:04.200
Was it something complicated?

54:06.286 --> 54:07.329
Right.

54:07.495 --> 54:08.914
This way, please.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.874
- What's your name?
- Marina.

54:11.041 --> 54:12.959
Pretty name, Marina.

54:13.126 --> 54:15.003
Stand there, please.

54:15.962 --> 54:17.547
Thank you.

54:25.347 --> 54:26.848
Here we are.

54:28.141 --> 54:30.977
Marina, right? Marina.

54:31.144 --> 54:32.979
Please, could you...

54:33.146 --> 54:35.982
...uncover your upper body?

54:40.278 --> 54:43.114
This'll be really quick, okay?
Here I go.

54:44.199 --> 54:45.575
That's it.

54:45.742 --> 54:48.495
Now, please raise your right arm.

54:49.663 --> 54:51.581
A bit higher.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.377
There.

54:56.086 --> 54:58.296
The same with the other arm.

55:00.924 --> 55:03.343
Very good, Marina.

55:05.762 --> 55:10.600
Were you attacked in any way?
Did you fall or anything like that?

55:11.226 --> 55:12.686
No.

55:13.019 --> 55:14.604
Are you sure?

55:14.938 --> 55:16.356
Yes.

55:20.235 --> 55:23.321
Well, now I'll ask you
to uncover your lower half.

55:23.488 --> 55:26.908
- Could you leave us so that...?
- No.

55:31.705 --> 55:32.956
Sorry.

55:33.123 --> 55:35.834
Could you uncover your lower half?
Almost done, Marina.

55:48.346 --> 55:51.766
Could you please raise
your right leg, Marina?

55:52.267 --> 55:54.853
To the side? There.

56:10.160 --> 56:11.578
<i>Hello, Marina.</i>

56:11.745 --> 56:13.121
<i>This is Gabo.</i>

56:13.288 --> 56:15.540
<i>Sorry to bother you.
Look...</i>

56:15.707 --> 56:19.544
<i>We're going to cremate Orlando.
It's what he wanted.</i>

56:19.919 --> 56:25.216
<i>To be clear, this is my own idea.
Sonia doesn't know yet.</i>

56:25.383 --> 56:27.802
<i>I wanted to offer you...</i>

56:27.969 --> 56:30.263
<i>... a bit of his ashes.</i>

56:31.473 --> 56:33.349
Thank you, but no.

56:33.516 --> 56:36.102
<i>I just feel you should
have them. Really.</i>

56:36.269 --> 56:38.688
In exchange for not showing up?

56:38.855 --> 56:41.274
<i>I'd love for you to come.</i>

56:41.441 --> 56:42.859
<i>- But...
- I'm eating right now.</i>

56:43.026 --> 56:45.862
<i>Sorry, I didn't want
to interrupt you.</i>

56:46.029 --> 56:47.864
Gabo, I'm hanging up.

56:48.031 --> 56:51.326
<i>Wait a second,
we haven't agreed on...</i>

57:24.067 --> 57:27.153
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Come in.

57:31.533 --> 57:33.493
Fucking gout.

57:34.744 --> 57:38.164
I can't believe even
your illnesses are corny.

57:38.623 --> 57:40.625
You look awful.

57:43.753 --> 57:46.256
Without glasses,
you can't even see me.

57:51.177 --> 57:52.637
You look...

57:52.804 --> 57:53.847
...awful.

57:55.014 --> 58:00.019
Have you come to hone your technique,
or hide from the world?

58:03.189 --> 58:04.524
Both?

58:04.691 --> 58:06.734
And vice versa?

58:07.944 --> 58:12.949
Look, I don't mind you coming
too little and too late...

58:13.783 --> 58:17.162
...or when you need
a little moral support.

58:17.537 --> 58:20.582
But I'm your teacher.
For singing.

58:21.291 --> 58:22.876
Lyrics.

58:23.042 --> 58:25.336
Not salsa, or merengue...

58:25.503 --> 58:27.338
...but lyrics.

58:27.505 --> 58:30.216
And you're not my psychologist.

58:30.383 --> 58:32.218
And you're not my father.

58:32.385 --> 58:33.720
No.

58:34.888 --> 58:36.931
What did I come for, then?

58:37.098 --> 58:39.559
To sing, I hope.

58:40.435 --> 58:42.395
To look for some love, maybe?

58:45.106 --> 58:46.900
You can't look for love.

58:47.066 --> 58:50.528
No. Not Saint Francis again, please.

58:51.404 --> 58:54.449
Saint Francis doesn't say:

58:54.908 --> 58:56.743
"Give me love, give me peace...

58:56.910 --> 59:00.747
...give me light,
give me this, give me that."

59:01.456 --> 59:03.082
Saint Francis says:

59:03.249 --> 59:06.002
"Make me an instrument of your love.

59:06.169 --> 59:08.796
Make me a channel of your peace."

59:44.499 --> 59:47.001
Why don't you sing for me instead?

01:02:14.941 --> 01:02:16.651
Diabla?

01:02:36.129 --> 01:02:38.589
<i>Onetto Textiles, good afternoon.</i>

01:02:38.756 --> 01:02:42.135
I have a wreath for
Mr. Orlando Onetto.

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:45.763
Could you tell me where
his wake is being held?

01:02:49.851 --> 01:02:52.270
Take it easy, beautiful.

01:02:53.229 --> 01:02:54.897
Okay.

01:02:55.064 --> 01:02:59.402
- Is this all you're stealing?
- If you had a bigger car, I'd steal more.

01:02:59.569 --> 01:03:02.196
What? You two sisters
are starting already?

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:16.586
You'll scare me to death.

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:17.795
No.

01:03:18.588 --> 01:03:20.882
I'll survive.

01:03:25.011 --> 01:03:27.138
I think we should call the police.

01:03:27.722 --> 01:03:32.518
- What for?
- Because it's a crime. Trespassing.

01:03:32.685 --> 01:03:37.106
No, I don't want any more police,
doctors, hospital gowns, uniforms.

01:03:37.273 --> 01:03:39.233
I don't want anything.

01:03:39.609 --> 01:03:42.528
Orlando's son just wants
me out of there fast.

01:03:42.695 --> 01:03:44.322
That's not the point.

01:03:44.489 --> 01:03:47.992
- It's no way to communicate.
- Oh, please, Mr. Contradictions.

01:03:48.159 --> 01:03:50.745
"That's not the point"?
Butt out.

01:03:50.912 --> 01:03:53.706
Butt out? I've heard these
stories for nine years.

01:03:53.873 --> 01:03:55.666
I'll leave your house
as soon as I can, okay?

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.835
No, it's not that.

01:03:58.002 --> 01:04:01.339
Our house is your house, always.

01:04:03.633 --> 01:04:05.885
Always, right?

01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:08.763
Yes, always, obviously.

01:04:10.556 --> 01:04:12.850
- Can I have one last favor?
- Another one?

01:04:13.017 --> 01:04:14.143
- Cut it out.
- What?

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.478
Cut it out.

01:04:15.645 --> 01:04:17.855
- Could you drop me off here?
- Why?

01:04:18.022 --> 01:04:20.399
- I want my dog.
- What for?

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:22.568
It's a bad idea for you
to do anything alone.

01:04:22.735 --> 01:04:27.657
No. Wait until we get home.
There, we can smoke something.

01:04:27.823 --> 01:04:32.495
We can relax, and you can make
a more considered decision, okay?

01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:34.956
Fine.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.588
Get out!

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.590
- You get out!
- Fuck, I'm driving.

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:46.175
Right...

01:05:39.145 --> 01:05:42.315
No one says a word!

01:05:45.026 --> 01:05:47.111
Leave, please.

01:05:47.737 --> 01:05:49.405
Mom!

01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:08.341
Get out, they said.
Have you no respect for people's pain?

01:06:08.883 --> 01:06:10.509
Get out!

01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:21.270
Marina!

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:28.277
I'm sorry!

01:06:29.487 --> 01:06:31.197
I'm very sorry.

01:06:31.364 --> 01:06:35.534
Everyone is upset.
It's not about you. I'm sorry.

01:06:41.123 --> 01:06:45.169
Saying goodbye to a loved one when
he dies is a basic human right, isn't it?

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:49.715
Yes.

01:06:52.301 --> 01:06:54.011
You're absolutely right.

01:06:54.178 --> 01:06:55.721
It's done, Gabo.

01:06:55.888 --> 01:06:59.266
Go back. Careful not to fall.

01:07:21.539 --> 01:07:24.417
Why did you come to
mess with the family?

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:27.920
Everyone told you
to leave us alone.

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.756
What do you want?

01:07:30.923 --> 01:07:34.009
For you to get out of here,
fucking faggot. Got it?

01:07:36.846 --> 01:07:39.348
- What are you looking at?
- You're looking at me.

01:07:39.515 --> 01:07:42.309
- Are you threatening me, fudge packer?
- No.

01:07:42.476 --> 01:07:46.939
Go destroy someone else's family,
you fucking monster!

01:07:48.566 --> 01:07:50.067
Hey! You fucking faggot.

01:07:50.234 --> 01:07:51.777
Stop the car!

01:07:52.778 --> 01:07:54.155
Stop!

01:07:56.157 --> 01:07:58.200
- Motherfucker!
- Let go, coward!

01:07:58.367 --> 01:07:59.927
- Let go! What do you want?
- You drive.

01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:01.078
Fucking cowards!

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:04.749
What do you want?

01:08:07.501 --> 01:08:09.003
Go, go!

01:08:10.463 --> 01:08:12.965
- Where's my dog?
- Shut up.

01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:15.342
What did you do to my dog, coward?

01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:16.635
That's not your house.

01:08:16.801 --> 01:08:19.054
If you liked my dress,
you could've taken it, asshole.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.765
This motherfucker wears dresses!

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.283
- Let go!
- Did you cut your dick off?

01:08:22.308 --> 01:08:24.143
Shut your mouth,
it smells like shit!

01:08:24.310 --> 01:08:25.953
Think you're Julia Roberts,
piece of shit?

01:08:25.978 --> 01:08:27.772
You wear a dress
with football-player legs?

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:30.399
You have no right to touch me!

01:08:30.983 --> 01:08:33.486
Think your dad would
be proud of you?

01:08:33.652 --> 01:08:36.197
He would slap you if he saw!

01:08:36.363 --> 01:08:38.491
You shouldn't have sent the police!

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:40.618
- What police?
- Let go of me!

01:08:40.785 --> 01:08:41.993
Let go of me!

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:44.037
I can't hear you!

01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:50.002
- Now, talk, motherfucker!
- Son of a bitch!

01:08:51.879 --> 01:08:54.256
Talk, you piece of shit!

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:15.778
I hope it's clear now.

01:09:16.862 --> 01:09:18.363
Let's go.

01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:22.436
Hello, Marina.

01:15:22.603 --> 01:15:24.730
Hello, Gaston.

01:16:06.855 --> 01:16:08.440
Here it is.

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:11.151
"Orlando Onetto Pertier."

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:15.739
What does it say?

01:16:18.909 --> 01:16:23.038
"We announce the painful
passing of our husband...

01:16:23.205 --> 01:16:26.291
...brother, father,
partner, and friend...

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:27.960
...Orlando Onetto Pertier.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:35.801
A funeral service will be held today at
4:30 p.m. at Parque de la Paz Cemetery.

01:16:35.968 --> 01:16:39.930
315 Ejército Avenue, Santiago.

01:16:40.097 --> 01:16:43.141
His wife, brother and children..."

01:16:43.308 --> 01:16:46.395
- Could you pass the avocado?
- Wait, listen.

01:16:46.561 --> 01:16:51.566
"It is with great sorrow that we
announce the painful passing...

01:16:51.733 --> 01:16:54.695
...of Orlando Onetto Pertier.

01:16:56.697 --> 01:16:58.573
Onetto Textiles employees."

01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:02.244
What's the point?
I don't get it.

01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:03.620
I'm reading.

01:17:03.787 --> 01:17:05.497
What for?

01:17:07.332 --> 01:17:08.458
Don't go.

01:17:09.293 --> 01:17:11.044
It would be masochism.

01:17:11.211 --> 01:17:13.755
Define "masochism" for me.

01:17:13.922 --> 01:17:15.048
Really.

01:17:15.757 --> 01:17:18.176
People who like to suffer.
Do you?

01:17:18.343 --> 01:17:20.929
- What's that got to do with it?
- I don't like to suffer.

01:17:21.096 --> 01:17:22.472
I'm reading to my sister...

01:17:22.639 --> 01:17:24.933
Listen, cut it out.
Really.

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:26.601
Stop.

01:17:28.937 --> 01:17:30.856
I'm going nowhere.

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:35.569
I've turned the page.

01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:40.866
Life goes on.

01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:43.076
- Why tell me what to do?
- No...

01:17:45.287 --> 01:17:47.956
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:51.501
Stronger.

01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:23.617
I have orangutan hands.

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:26.620
Nonsense.

01:18:45.555 --> 01:18:47.182
Just a sec.

01:18:47.641 --> 01:18:49.226
I have to adjust it.

01:19:41.278 --> 01:19:43.280
Here you go, sir.

01:19:43.864 --> 01:19:45.532
Just a minute.

01:19:53.623 --> 01:19:55.500
I lose everything.

01:19:55.667 --> 01:19:57.377
Maybe it's the old age.

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:02.799
Here. Keep the change.

01:20:05.302 --> 01:20:07.179
What's wrong?

01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:11.099
Sorry, where is that key from,
the one with the number?

01:20:12.017 --> 01:20:13.727
From my sauna.

01:20:13.894 --> 01:20:17.606
- Your sauna?
- Yes, my locker at a nearby sauna:

01:20:17.772 --> 01:20:19.149
Finlandia.

01:20:19.316 --> 01:20:20.734
Why?

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:24.446
It just caught my eye, sorry.

01:21:06.321 --> 01:21:08.865
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:21:09.449 --> 01:21:11.243
Is it mixed?

01:21:13.286 --> 01:21:15.789
But the areas are separate?

01:21:15.956 --> 01:21:17.791
Of course.

01:21:27.342 --> 01:21:29.261
How much is it?

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.522
Here.

01:21:46.570 --> 01:21:47.779
Thanks.

01:23:50.402 --> 01:23:53.488
- Where are the lockers?
- That way.

01:26:00.949 --> 01:26:03.493
Get out, sir,
I have an emergency.

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.578
I have an emergency too.

01:26:05.745 --> 01:26:07.330
Get out!

01:26:10.792 --> 01:26:13.503
Take Alameda Street, please, sir.

01:26:36.484 --> 01:26:38.278
Marina!

01:26:41.072 --> 01:26:45.618
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- The ceremony is over, go home!

01:26:45.785 --> 01:26:47.328
Could you leave us in peace?

01:26:47.495 --> 01:26:51.666
Move, move!
Crazy man! Get lost!

01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:55.378
- Sonia, she's a woman.
- She's not a woman.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:01.175
Move!

01:27:04.846 --> 01:27:08.349
Move it, made-up faggot!
Move it, piece of shit!

01:27:08.516 --> 01:27:09.642
You motherfucker.

01:27:09.809 --> 01:27:12.186
- Crazy woman!
- Marina, don't do that!

01:27:13.897 --> 01:27:14.939
I want!

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.858
My!

01:27:17.609 --> 01:27:19.193
Dog!

01:27:37.045 --> 01:27:39.255
Orlando's keys.

01:27:39.422 --> 01:27:40.882
All right?

01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:44.135
- Let's go, Bruno.
- Relax.

01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:45.845
Go!

01:28:14.248 --> 01:28:15.917
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:28:16.084 --> 01:28:18.586
Was Orlando Onetto's
funeral held here?

01:28:18.753 --> 01:28:21.923
I don't know.
I just clean here.

01:28:23.591 --> 01:28:26.094
Might you know where he is?

01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:28.721
No idea, ma'am.

01:31:34.907 --> 01:31:36.367
Come in.

01:31:52.717 --> 01:31:53.885
Thank you.

01:34:57.401 --> 01:34:59.528
Bye, Diabla.

01:38:38.038 --> 01:38:40.165
