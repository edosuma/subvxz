WEBVTT

00:04.505 --> 00:05.106
(sniffs)

00:05.473 --> 00:06.940
(gags)

00:06.940 --> 00:08.709
ARE YOU WEARING COLOGNE?

00:08.709 --> 00:11.712
YEAH, I GOT IT
FROM UNDER YOUR SINK.

00:11.712 --> 00:17.651
DUDE, THAT'S THE CRAP
CARMEN GAVE ME FOR CHRISTMAS.

00:17.651 --> 00:21.255
I USE THAT TO KILL ANTS
AROUND THE GRILL.

00:21.255 --> 00:24.625
I JUST WANTED TO SMELL GOOD.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.628
THERE ARE ONLY TWO REASONS
WHY A BOY WANTS TO SMELL GOOD.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.664
EITHER HE LIKES A GIRL
OR HE LIKES A BOY.

00:30.664 --> 00:34.268
YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABS TO GET
A BOY, SO WHAT'S HER NAME?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.604
KRISTI CHAPMAN.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.706
SHE PUT THE WORD OUT
THAT SHE LIKES ME.

00:38.706 --> 00:43.043
(imitates teenage girl) LIKES
YOU, OR, LIKE, "LIKES" YOU?

00:43.043 --> 00:44.678
SHE WROTE MY NAME ON HER ARM,

00:44.678 --> 00:46.714
AND IT'S BEEN THERE
FOR TWO WEEKS.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.049
(normal voice) WELL,
SHE SHOWERS AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.719
YOU GOT THAT IN COMMON.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.020
HEY.

00:53.020 --> 00:56.324
HEY, ERNIE.
MY BOY'S BECOMING A MAN.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.093
HE JUST FOUND OUT
THAT A GIRL LIKES HIM.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.061
"LIKE" LIKES HIM.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.832
HEY, HEY, GOOD FOR YOU, MAX!

01:04.832 --> 01:07.034
HEY, JUST MAKE SURE
IT'S NOT A PRANK, THOUGH.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.669
'CAUSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

01:08.669 --> 01:10.671
WHO WRITE FAKE NOTES
PRETENDING TO BE A GIRL

01:10.671 --> 01:13.674
JUST TO GET YOU TO SHOW UP
AT THE PEP RALLY

01:13.674 --> 01:17.578
IN SHORTY SHORTS
AND A MESH SHIRT!

01:17.578 --> 01:22.550
DUDE, I THOUGHT
YOU RECOGNIZED MY HANDWRITING.

01:22.550 --> 01:26.387
YOU MADE A FOOL OF ME
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.290
BUT IT WAS PRETTY DAMN FUNNY.
(laughing)

01:29.290 --> 01:31.192
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

01:31.192 --> 01:34.628
GO GET 'EM, STUD.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

01:34.628 --> 01:37.598
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET YOUR GIRL
WALKING LIKE THAT.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.968
(imitates teenage girl)
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

01:40.968 --> 01:44.872
(normal voice) YOU GOTTA GO
SINGLE STRAP, MAN, CRAB OUT.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.540
IT'S TOO HEAVY.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.309
THERE'S A TON OF BOOKS
IN THERE.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.778
FORGET ABOUT THE BOOKS.

01:52.380 --> 01:55.883
CHECK IT OUT--
CRAB OUT IN STYLE.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.420
'SUP?

01:59.420 --> 02:02.890
(sniffs)
YOU SMELL LIKE CAFETERIA PIZZA.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.858
I LIKE CAFETERIA PIZZA.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.860
YOU SEE HOW I'M LOOKING AT HER
FROM THE SIDE?

02:06.860 --> 02:08.829
SHE ONLY GETS ONE EYE,
'CAUSE THE OTHER EYE

02:08.829 --> 02:11.799
IS ALWAYS SCOPING OUT
FOR SOMETHING BETTER. HELLO.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.002
NOW SHOW ME A LITTLE, OKAY?
PRETEND I'M YOUR GIRL.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.770
HEY, I WANNA BE SOMEONE.

02:16.770 --> 02:22.042
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE MY LARGE
BUT APPROACHABLE GIRLFRIEND.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.944
OKAY? YOU GOT A PRETTY FACE,

02:23.944 --> 02:26.847
BUT IT'S REALLY A SHAME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO YOURSELF.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.148
LET'S DO THIS, OKAY?

02:28.148 --> 02:31.852
(imitates teenage girl)
KRISTI IS SO BITING MY STYLE.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.254
(imitates teenage girl)
SHE TOTALLY KNOWS

02:33.254 --> 02:35.423
THAT YOU HAVE
THAT SAME SKIRT. GOD!

02:41.262 --> 02:45.933
'SUP, KRISTI?
NO, MAN! DON'T LOOK AT ME!
LOOK THROUGH ME!

02:45.933 --> 02:48.269
YOU OWN ME! TRY IT AGAIN.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.372
'SUP?

02:51.372 --> 02:53.073
THERE YOU GO, PLAYER.
THERE YOU GO.

02:53.073 --> 02:54.642
COME ON.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.745
BUT WHERE'S YOUR OTHER EYE?
WHERE'S THE OTHER EYE?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.213
NO!

02:59.213 --> 03:03.517
NOT ERNIE!
YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN HIM!

03:03.517 --> 03:05.519
HEY, YOU JUST LOST
YOUR WING WOMAN.

03:05.519 --> 03:09.189
I DON'T PLAY WITH HATERS.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.226
AHEM. WATCH HOW IT'S DONE.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.194
(sniffs)

03:14.194 --> 03:15.529
'SUP, BABY?

03:15.529 --> 03:18.165
YOU LOOK GOOD THIS MORNING.

03:18.165 --> 03:22.470
(imitates teenage girl)
WHATEVER.

03:24.037 --> 03:27.408
I DON'T CARE. SHE'S, LIKE, 30,
ANYWAYS, WITH 2 KIDS.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.389
MAX'S GIRLFRIEND
IS STILL HERE?

03:41.389 --> 03:45.259
YEAH, I'M KEEPING MY EYE ON HIM.
I THINK THEY MIGHT TRY TO KISS.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.660
MOM, NO. DON'T SMOTHER HIM.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.262
KIDS CAN ONLY GROW UP
IF THEY HAVE FREEDOM.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.763
THE BEST PARENTING IS

03:49.763 --> 03:51.231
REALLY JUST TO LET THEM
DO WHAT THEY WANT.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.701
OH, THIS OUGHTA BE GOOD.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:53.701 --> 03:56.203
I WANNA SPEND THE WEEKEND
ON JENNY'S HOUSEBOAT.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.705
IT'LL BE TOTALLY SAFE.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.807
ALL THE COOL KIDS
WILL BE THERE,

03:59.807 --> 04:02.576
MANY OF THEM
REGULAR CHURCHGOERS.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.346
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
"LAKE TAKE-YOUR-TOP-OFF,"

04:05.346 --> 04:06.947
AND THAT'S FINAL.

04:06.947 --> 04:08.916
SO I CAN'T GO TO A SIMPLE PARTY
ON THE LAKE,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.918
BUT THE SECOND
YOU LEAVE THE ROOM,

04:10.918 --> 04:13.253
MAX AND HIS GIRLFRIEND
CAN MAKE OUT LIKE MONKEYS?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.988
THEY WERE MAKING OUT?

04:14.988 --> 04:17.224
OH, DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD?

04:17.224 --> 04:19.893
I GET GOSSIPY
WHEN I'M OPPRESSED.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.697
MAX'S GIRLFRIEND'S STILL HERE?
NOT FOR LONG.

04:23.697 --> 04:27.000
CARMEN SAID THEY WERE MAKING OUT
WHEN I LEFT THE ROOM.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.769
SWEET.

04:28.769 --> 04:32.806
BOY, LOOK AT THAT. HE'S A LOPEZ.
HE'S GOING BACK FOR SECONDS!

04:32.806 --> 04:34.508
TIME FOR DINNER!

04:36.544 --> 04:39.079
DAMN, ANGIE,
YOU TREAT HIM LIKE A BABY.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.282
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HOLD HIM
UPSIDE DOWN BY HIS LEGS

04:42.282 --> 04:43.984
AND POWDER HIS BOTTOM?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.387
KRISTI'S GOTTA GO.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.988
SEE YOU LATER,
MR. AND MRS. LOPEZ.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.591
KRISTI, YOU CAN'T
STAY FOR DINNER--
BYE, KRISTI.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.896
TOMORROW WE CAN
HANG OUT AT MY HOUSE.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.366
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
A LITTLE MORE PRIVATE.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.133
IT IS.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.169
I LOVE YOU.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.338
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.380
ALL RIGHT, MOM, WHERE'S THIS
DINNER THAT'S SO IMPORTANT,

05:12.380 --> 05:14.815
YOU HAD TO GET ALL UP
IN MY STUFF?

05:14.815 --> 05:20.354
MAX, I INTERRUPTED YOU BECAUSE
YOU WERE MOVING WAY TOO FAST.

05:20.354 --> 05:23.357
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE SAYING
"I LOVE YOU."

05:23.357 --> 05:25.025
WELL, SHE SAID IT TO ME.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.227
AND I REALLY LIKE HER,
SO I SAID IT BACK.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.263
WHOA, WHOA, DUDE.
I AGREE WITH YOUR MOTHER.

05:30.263 --> 05:31.665
KISSING IS ONE THING,
BUT, MAX,

05:31.665 --> 05:35.035
YOU NEVER, EVER SAY
"I LOVE YOU" TO A GIRL.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.371
THAT'S LIKE COVERING YOURSELF
IN BLOODY MEAT

05:37.371 --> 05:39.773
AND JUMPING
INTO A SHARK TANK!

05:39.773 --> 05:43.076
GEORGE.
I'M TEACHING OUR SON.

05:43.076 --> 05:46.714
YOU NEVER SAY "I LOVE YOU"
UNTIL YOU FIND THE ONE SHARK

05:46.714 --> 05:49.517
YOU WANNA SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.555
I ALREADY SAID IT.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.924
WHAT DO I SAY NOW
IF SHE ASKS ME IF I LOVE HER?

05:56.924 --> 05:58.258
YOU GO LIKE THIS--

05:58.258 --> 06:01.328
YOU SAY, "WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I'M HERE, AIN'T I?"

06:01.328 --> 06:02.730
AND THEN DIP AND GO.

06:02.730 --> 06:06.800
MAX, WHY DON'T YOU GO UPSTAIRS
AND WASH UP?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.336
I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

06:09.336 --> 06:12.906
YOU GOTTA DIP AND GO.

06:12.906 --> 06:16.076
HOW CAN YOU FILL HIS HEAD
WITH ALL THAT STUFF?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.078
YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN HIM
INTO A LITTLE PLAYER.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.813
ANGIE, I'M SCHOOLING HIM.
OKAY? HE'S MY SON.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.315
AND I JUST WANT HIM
TO DO BETTER WITH GIRLS

06:22.315 --> 06:24.117
THAN I DID IN HIGH SCHOOL.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.920
IF HE DATES ONE MORE GIRL,
HE'LL DOUBLE YOUR TOTAL.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.157
HOW COME NO ONE BELIEVES
I MADE OUT WITH CINDY FIGUEROA?

06:30.157 --> 06:32.660
BECAUSE SHE PASSED A FLYER
AROUND SCHOOL THAT SAID,

06:32.660 --> 06:35.395
"I DID NOT MAKE OUT
WITH GEORGE LOPEZ."

06:35.395 --> 06:37.498
I'M NOT SAYING
SHE DIDN'T REGRET IT.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.700
I'M JUST SAYING IT HAPPENED.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.703
I JUST THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO PUSH HIM INTO SOMETHING

06:42.703 --> 06:44.404
HE'S NOT READY FOR.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.674
HE'S NOT,
OR YOU'RE NOT?

06:46.674 --> 06:48.408
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

06:48.408 --> 06:53.346
YOU CAN'T KEEP MAX A LITTLE BOY
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.148
HE WILL ALWAYS BE
MY LITTLE BOY.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.619
AND I WILL ALWAYS PROTECT HIM
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MOTHERS DO.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.220
YEAH, RIGHT,
THAT'S WHAT MOTHERS DO.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.655
HEY, MOM.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.391
REMEMBER WHEN YOU
PROTECTED ME FROM NEW SHOES,

07:04.391 --> 07:05.659
VITAMINS AND TOYS?

07:05.659 --> 07:10.163
HEY, I PROTECTED YOU
PLENTY OF TIMES.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.399
REMEMBER THAT TIME
I THREW MY BODY OVER YOURS

07:12.399 --> 07:14.301
IN THAT CAR ACCIDENT?

07:14.301 --> 07:15.736
MOM, YOUR DOOR DIDN'T WORK.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.472
YOU WERE TRYING TO GET OUT
BY CLIMBING OVER ME.

07:18.472 --> 07:21.274
SINCE WHEN DOES IT
MAKE YOU A GOOD MOTHER

07:21.274 --> 07:23.143
TO DIE WITH YOUR SON?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.915
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

07:31.585 --> 07:33.453
* ALL MY FRIENDS

07:33.453 --> 07:36.824
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

07:38.425 --> 07:40.227
* THE LOW RIDER

07:40.227 --> 07:43.664
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

07:58.779 --> 08:01.081
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY LEFT,
AND I WORKED OUT TODAY!

08:01.081 --> 08:04.785
OH, IT'S ONLY YOU.
IT'S 2:30 IN THE MORNING, MAN.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.787
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THOSE SHEETS?

08:06.787 --> 08:08.989
I'M DOING LAUNDRY.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.191
HEY...

08:11.191 --> 08:12.926
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON?

08:12.926 --> 08:17.998
DO YOU NEED TO TALK, MAX?
'CAUSE I COULD WAKE UP YOUR MOM.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.905
I HAD THIS DREAM
THAT I WAS KAYAKING,

08:24.905 --> 08:29.009
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
"I DON'T KAYAK.

08:29.009 --> 08:32.846
WHY DOES THIS RIVER
SMELL LIKE ASPARAGUS?"

08:32.846 --> 08:35.215
OH, MAN, YOU PEED THE BED?

08:35.215 --> 08:39.119
DUDE, THIS IS NASTY!

08:39.119 --> 08:40.721
I'M SORRY, DAD.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.624
MAX, YOU'RE TOO OLD
TO BE DOING THIS.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.359
GRANDMA SAID YOU PEED THE BED
WHEN YOU WERE A KID.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.762
ONCE OR TWICE.

08:48.762 --> 08:52.065
SHE SAID YOU DID IT
ALL THE TIME.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.701
DAMN!

08:53.701 --> 08:55.168
WELL, SHE'S NOT PERFECT,
EITHER.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.871
ASK HER TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN SHE SNEEZES.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.240
SHE'LL BE LIKE...
(imitates sneeze) OH.

09:02.910 --> 09:07.080
SO...
WHY DID YOU WET THE BED?

09:07.080 --> 09:09.116
I WAS GOING THROUGH
A LOT OF STUFF, MAX.

09:09.116 --> 09:11.384
I HAD A LOT
OF EMOTIONAL DISCHARGE

09:11.384 --> 09:14.054
THAT MANIFESTED ITSELF AS PEE.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.893
MAYBE I HAVE THAT, TOO.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.230
COME ON, MAN, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT?

09:23.230 --> 09:24.497
KRISTI.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.734
SHE'S HAD A LOT
OF OTHER BOYFRIENDS.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.736
WHAT IF I'M DOING
EVERYTHING WRONG?

09:28.736 --> 09:31.504
MAX, LET ME GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE.

09:31.504 --> 09:35.175
WOMEN LOVE A GUY
WHO'S POTTY TRAINED.

09:39.747 --> 09:43.150
I'D STOP IT IF I COULD.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.919
THIS HAPPENED
A BUNCH OF TIMES BEFORE.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.921
MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.923
LOOK, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT IT IS, OKAY?

09:49.923 --> 09:53.293
YOU'RE 14. IT'S TIME TO STOP.
SUCK IT UP AND BE A MAN!

09:53.293 --> 09:56.764
THANKS A LOT.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.900
OKAY.
LOOK, HAVE A SEAT.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.869
MAX, HERE'S WHAT I DID.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.671
I STOPPED DRINKING ANYTHING

10:03.671 --> 10:07.107
THREE HOURS
BEFORE I WENT TO BED.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.276
THEN I'D SET THE ALARM
SO I'D WAKE UP AT NIGHT

10:09.276 --> 10:10.978
AND GO TO THE BATHROOM.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.013
I'M GONNA SET MY ALARM
RIGHT NOW.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.515
OKAY, GOOD. BUT DON'T TELL
YOUR MOM ABOUT THIS, ALL RIGHT?

10:15.515 --> 10:17.718
SHE ALREADY THINKS
YOU CAN'T HANDLE A GIRLFRIEND.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.687
AND IF SHE FINDS OUT
YOU'RE STRESSING ABOUT THIS,

10:19.687 --> 10:21.121
THEN SHE'LL BE RIGHT.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.390
AND THEN SHE'LL
HAVE THE POWER?

10:23.390 --> 10:26.359
COME ON, MAN.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.000
I'M PROUD OF YOU, SON.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.202
I'D HUG YOU RIGHT NOW,
BUT Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

10:35.202 --> 10:37.137
YOU SMELL LIKE PEE.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.344
I HAVE TO SAY I AGREE
WITH YOU ON THIS, GEORGE.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.579
I MEAN, I SEE NO PROBLEM
WITH MAX DATING.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.882
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE IN CUBA--

10:48.882 --> 10:50.650
OH, VIC.
VIC, COME ON, MAN.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.153
LOOK, IT'S LATE. I'M TIRED.
I AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THIS.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.756
JUST GET TO
THE VERY END OF THE STORY.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.225
WELL, THE CHICKEN LIVED,

10:58.225 --> 11:00.027
AND THE GIRL HAD TO

11:00.027 --> 11:03.396
WEAR AN EYE PATCH
THE REST OF HER LIFE.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.939
(gasps)

11:11.939 --> 11:14.241
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR SHEETS?

11:14.241 --> 11:18.178
UH... I GUESS IT'S TIME
YOU KNEW THE TRUTH.

11:18.178 --> 11:22.182
CARMEN CAME INTO MY ROOM
AND PEED IN MY BED.

11:24.117 --> 11:29.256
I SAW THIS RAVEN-HAIRED,
CINNAMON-SKINNED BEAUTY.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.992
LAST LINE, VIC!

11:31.992 --> 11:37.364
AND IT TURNS OUT
IT WAS THE EXACT SAME CHICKEN.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.069
(Angie) GEORGE?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.639
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:46.639 --> 11:48.375
I SWEAR,
I DIDN'T DRINK ANY WATER.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.979
I DID WHAT YOU SAID,
AND IT STILL HAPPENED.

11:51.979 --> 11:56.516
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT?
DID THIS HAPPEN BEFORE?

11:56.516 --> 11:57.584
UH...

11:57.584 --> 12:01.021
MAYBE.

12:01.021 --> 12:04.224
IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON
BEHIND MY BACK

12:04.224 --> 12:06.159
THAT YOU TWO
ARE KEEPING FROM ME?

12:06.159 --> 12:07.360
ANGIE, YOU WANNA
FIGHT ABOUT THIS,

12:07.360 --> 12:08.996
OR DO YOU WANNA HEAR

12:08.996 --> 12:12.232
ONE OF YOUR FATHER'S
HILARIOUS CHICKEN STORIES? VIC!

12:12.232 --> 12:14.201
COME ON, MAN,
DON'T LEAVE ME HANGING.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.670
TELL 'EM ABOUT THE CINNAMON
CHICKEN WITH THE RAVEN EYE.

12:17.670 --> 12:21.274
MAX, PUT THOSE IN THE WASHER,
AND THEN GO ON UP TO YOUR ROOM.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.277
I'LL BE UP IN A MINUTE
WITH SOME FRESH SHEETS.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.316
GEORGE... I AM HIS MOTHER.

12:29.316 --> 12:32.185
I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON WITH MAX.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.121
ANGIE, HE WET THE BED
A FEW NIGHTS AGO,

12:34.121 --> 12:37.190
BUT I'M DEALING WITH IT.
HOW ARE YOU DEALING WITH IT?

12:37.190 --> 12:40.327
THE LOPEZ WAY--
BY KEEPING IT A SECRET!

12:40.327 --> 12:45.065
YOU KNOW, IF MAX
HAS WET THE BED REPEATEDLY,

12:45.065 --> 12:48.301
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT
THIS IS A PHYSICAL PROBLEM.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.838
DOES THE BOY HAVE
ANY OTHER HEALTH ISSUES?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.572
NO, MAN, HE'S FINE.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.242
HE DID HAVE A FEVER
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.945
AND THERE WAS THAT NIGHT HE GOT
THOSE STRANGE STOMACH CRAMPS.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.512
THOSE WEREN'T SO STRANGE.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.314
HE GOT IN A CONTEST
TO SEE WHO COULD FINISH

13:01.314 --> 13:03.083
A WHOLE BUCKET
OF GUMMY WORMS.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.018
WHOSE DUMB IDEA WAS THAT?

13:05.018 --> 13:07.287
THE WINNER. THANK YOU.

13:13.126 --> 13:16.329
BED-WETTING, FEVER,
MAYBE CRAMPS--

13:16.329 --> 13:20.200
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE COULD HAVE
A URINARY TRACT INFECTION.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.735
I THOUGHT ONLY GIRLS
GOT THOSE.

13:22.735 --> 13:27.407
NO, A BOY CAN GET THEM
IF HE HAS BEEN SEXUALLY ACTIVE.

13:28.976 --> 13:31.311
BUT HE'S SO YOUNG.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.547
14 IS A MAN
IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.449
IN FACT...

13:36.449 --> 13:39.920
COME ON, MAN, LAST LINE!

13:39.920 --> 13:42.990
MY FATHER PAID THE GIRL
WITH A CHICKEN.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.295
MAX!

13:48.295 --> 13:51.031
I TOLD YOU HE WASN'T READY
FOR A RELATIONSHIP.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.033
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.805
MAX, WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

13:58.805 --> 14:02.475
THE MORE WE TALK ABOUT MY
BED-WETTING, THE WORSE IT GETS.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.312
RELAX, IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
IT'S ABOUT KRISTI.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.548
DID THAT LITTLE TRAMP
STEAL YOUR VIRGINITY?

14:15.288 --> 14:18.491
YOU HAVE TO TELL US
RIGHT NOW...

14:18.491 --> 14:21.361
WHAT HAVE YOU AND KRISTI
BEEN DOING?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.162
NOTHING!

14:22.162 --> 14:23.863
TELL THE TRUTH.

14:23.863 --> 14:27.334
WE JUST MADE OUT...
AND STUFF.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.339
STUFF?

14:32.339 --> 14:36.977
ALL RIGHT,
I GOT UPSTAIRS-OUTSIDEES.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.549
SEE? HE'S STILL UPSTAIRS.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.085
HE'S NOT ANYWHERE
NEAR ANY OF THE FLOORS

14:45.085 --> 14:47.420
WHERE THE BAD STUFF HAPPENS.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.061
LOOK, I'M TIRED.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.630
IF YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE SLEEPING IN THE TUB.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.603
HEY, OPEN THE DRAIN.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DROWN.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.080
THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.682
WE SHOULD BE IN THERE
WITH OUR SON.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.084
HE'S EMBARRASSED, ANGIE.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.419
HE DOESN'T WANT HIS MOM
HOLDING HIS HAND

15:19.419 --> 15:22.922
WHEN HE'S BEING TESTED
FOR A VENEREAL DISEASE.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.225
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
MY SON GOT IT

15:25.225 --> 15:28.561
FROM SITTING ON THAT TRUCK
YOUR KID'S PLAYING WITH.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.233
IF MAX AND KRISTI DID
DO SOMETHING, IT'S YOUR FAULT

15:33.233 --> 15:36.603
FOR GIVING HIM YOUR STUPID
LITTLE PLAYER LESSONS.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.606
I CAN'T HELP IT IF MY TEACHINGS
ARE THAT POWERFUL.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.609
THAT'S WHY I DON'T PUT IT OUT
ON VIDEO, YOU KNOW?

15:42.609 --> 15:45.812
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THE CHINESE
GOT A HOLD OF MY TECHNIQUE?

15:45.812 --> 15:48.781
THERE'D BE
LIKE A BILLION OF 'EM.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.150
MR. AND MRS. LOPEZ?

15:50.150 --> 15:53.353
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.059
MAX WILL BE OUT
IN A MINUTE,

15:59.059 --> 16:00.460
BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU

16:00.460 --> 16:02.295
THAT HE DOES HAVE
A URINARY TRACT INFECTION.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.298
I KNEW THAT GIRL WAS UNCLEAN
THE MINUTE I SAW HER.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.268
THE WAY SHE WALKED,
THE WAY SHE LOOKED AT HIM...

16:08.268 --> 16:11.271
MAX DIDN'T GET THIS
FROM SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.606
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

16:13.606 --> 16:14.874
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.210
THE MOST HE'S EVER GOTTEN
IS UPSTAIRS-OUTSIDEES.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.182
WELL, THEN HOW DID
HE GET THE INFECTION?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.384
WELL, I DID AN ULTRASOUND,

16:24.384 --> 16:28.155
AND I FOUND THAT THE TUBES
LEADING FROM MAX'S KIDNEYS

16:28.155 --> 16:30.623
ARE TOO NARROW,
SO HIS URINE'S BACKING UP.

16:30.623 --> 16:33.693
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE U.T.I.
THAT'S WHY HE'S WETTING THE BED.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.163
WELL, HOW SERIOUS IS THAT?

16:36.163 --> 16:37.464
OH, MAX IS GONNA BE FINE.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.999
WE HAVE A SURGERY
THAT CORRECTS THE PROBLEM.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.734
BUT YOU'RE LUCKY
WE CAUGHT IT IN TIME.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.503
WELL, WHAT IF WE HADN'T?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.872
WELL, YOUR SON WOULD HAVE
DEVELOPED KIDNEY DISEASE

16:45.872 --> 16:48.041
AND EVENTUALLY WOULD HAVE
NEEDED A TRANSPLANT.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.077
OH, MY GOD.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.612
HE'S ONLY WET THE BED
A FEW TIMES.

16:52.612 --> 16:56.316
ACCORDING TO MAX, HE'S BEEN
WETTING THE BED FOR MONTHS.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.451
HE SAID HE TRIED TO TELL YOU.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.688
YEAH.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.391
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

17:04.391 --> 17:07.460
WELL, I CAN REFER YOU
TO AN EXCELLENT KIDNEY SURGEON--

17:07.460 --> 17:10.597
GREAT GUY, BIG HOUSE,
TROPHY WIFE.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.100
WORKS HALF MY HOURS.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.102
PEOPLE TOLD ME TO SPECIALIZE,

17:15.102 --> 17:18.605
BUT I SAID,
"WHAT'S MORE SPECIAL THAN KIDS?"

17:20.740 --> 17:22.409
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

17:22.409 --> 17:26.679
I HAVE TO LOOK INTO THE WAXY EAR
OF A SCREAMING 4-YEAR-OLD.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.122
GO AHEAD AND SAY IT.
I'M A HORRIBLE FATHER.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.290
YOU'RE NOT
A HORRIBLE FATHER.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.891
MY SON WAS DEVELOPING
KIDNEY DISEASE,

17:38.891 --> 17:41.428
AND I JUST TOLD HIM
TO SUCK IT UP AND BE A MAN!

17:41.428 --> 17:44.431
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS MAX IS GONNA BE OKAY.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.333
ANGIE, WHAT WAS I THINKING?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.301
I MEAN, MY DAD DIED
OF KIDNEY DISEASE.

17:48.301 --> 17:49.902
MAX HAS MY BAD GENES.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.372
HE'S GOT BOTH OUR GENES,
GEORGE.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.274
WELL, LOOK,
IF HE UNEXPECTEDLY DIES

17:54.274 --> 17:56.276
OF SOFT HAIR
AND LONG EYELASHES,

17:56.276 --> 17:58.245
THEN IT'LL BE YOUR FAULT.

17:58.245 --> 17:59.479
THIS ONE'S ON ME.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.126
MAX, TAKE A SEAT.

18:15.795 --> 18:20.933
LISTEN, WHEN I SAID TO
SUCK IT UP AND BE A MAN,

18:20.933 --> 18:23.002
I WAS WRONG.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.871
YEAH, YOU WERE.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.942
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SOMETIMES
I'M WINGING THIS STUFF

18:29.942 --> 18:32.044
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A DAD.

18:32.044 --> 18:35.014
IT'S OKAY.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.516
NO, IT'S NOT.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.018
LOOK, YOU TRIED TO
TALK TO ME ABOUT SOMETHING,

18:39.018 --> 18:40.820
AND I WOULDN'T LISTEN TO YOU.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.556
OKAY, SO FROM NOW ON,
WHENEVER YOU WANNA TALK TO ME,

18:43.556 --> 18:45.625
I'LL LISTEN, OKAY,
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.095
WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING
BOTHERING ME.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.931
THAT'S OKAY, SON.
WHAT IS IT?

18:51.931 --> 18:56.236
IS MY HEAD GONNA
BALLOON UP LIKE YOURS?

19:01.674 --> 19:05.678
I MEAN,
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

19:05.678 --> 19:09.316
WHY DON'T YOU TRY
STAYING DRY FOR TWO DAYS

19:09.316 --> 19:12.252
BEFORE YOU'RE
TAKING SHOTS AT ME?

19:13.520 --> 19:16.923
MAX, KRISTI'S ON THE PHONE.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.359
DAD, WHAT DO I TELL HER
ABOUT THE OPERATION?

19:22.128 --> 19:25.332
KRISTI?
HEY, IT'S MR. LOPEZ.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.367
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A HEADS UP.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.837
MAX IS GOING IN
FOR SOME MAJOR SURGERY.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.340
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU HIMSELF,
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.007
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:35.007 --> 19:37.410
TRUST ME.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.181
HEY, KRISTI.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.583
WHAT?

19:43.583 --> 19:46.052
SHE SAID SHE'S GONNA
MAKE ME BROWNIES.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.854
HELLO.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.327
AND BRING ME
SKATEBOARD MAGAZINES.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.198
SHE JUST SAID "I LOVE YOU."

19:59.198 --> 20:01.067
OKAY, REMEMBER
WHAT I TOLD YOU.

20:01.067 --> 20:03.803
YEAH, I HEARD YOU.

20:03.803 --> 20:06.406
I'M HERE, AIN'T I?

20:08.040 --> 20:11.811
SORRY, THAT WAS FOR MY DAD.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.951
HEY.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.920
HEY.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.257
DR. WOODSON,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
HE CAME BY TO CHECK ON MAX.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.858
HE'S RECOVERING WELL
FROM THE SURGERY.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.627
HE'LL BE UP AND ABOUT
IN NO TIME.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.762
I DIDN'T THINK DOCTORS
MADE HOUSE CALLS ANYMORE.

20:29.762 --> 20:33.300
WELL, I GOT TWO EXES
AND A GAMBLING PROBLEM.

20:33.300 --> 20:36.369
IF YOU COULD PAY ME IN CASH,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.274
SO... DOCTOR.

20:41.274 --> 20:44.544
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE
ANOTHER HOUSE CALL?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.679
I HAVE SOMETHING
YOU MIGHT WANNA LOOK AT.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.584
DON'T GO THERE, MOM.
HE'S A PEDIATRICIAN, NOT A VET.
