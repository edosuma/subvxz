00:33.324 --> 00:35.827


00:35.910 --> 00:38.163
There's something wrong with this machine.

00:38.246 --> 00:40.290
Step back and I'll hit it for you.

00:42.917 --> 00:43.960
Aw, baby girl,

00:44.044 --> 00:45.754
there ain't nothing wrong
with the machine.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.756
It says you ain't got no more in there.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.215
It barely looked!

00:50.258 --> 00:53.678
I know. I'll get another cash advance
on my credit card!

00:53.762 --> 00:54.721
Good idea.

00:54.804 --> 00:57.474
If I'd never gotten an advance
on my credit card,

00:57.557 --> 01:01.227
I never woulda gone
to the Costco to buy a 78-inch TV,

01:01.311 --> 01:03.146
never woulda slipped in pee-pee,

01:03.229 --> 01:05.065
never woulda got my settlement money.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.234
Scary to think about the road
not traveled, huh?

01:13.364 --> 01:14.657
Excuse me, Uncle Hank.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.702
Can you please loan me $257?

01:17.786 --> 01:20.246
-No.
I need it for my car loan,

01:20.330 --> 01:23.416
which you cosigned in the first place.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.585
You're saying that like it's my fault.

01:25.668 --> 01:26.503
Well...

01:26.586 --> 01:27.921
Luanne, I don't understand.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.048
You are working full-time
at the barbershop.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.508
Where is the money going?

01:31.591 --> 01:33.718
I don't know. Things?

01:33.802 --> 01:36.012
Let me see your credit card statement.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.140
Oh, my god, you've been
taking cash advances?

01:39.224 --> 01:40.767
Luanne, the interest they charge

01:40.850 --> 01:43.061
is so high, you can never
crawl out from under it.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.604
You keep spending like this,

01:44.687 --> 01:47.357
and someday you'll be
a poor, hungry old woman

01:47.440 --> 01:49.275
who can't afford a retirement home.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.527
Then where'll you be?

01:50.610 --> 01:51.986
I don't wanna think about it.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.030
-The street.
-Help!

01:54.114 --> 01:55.198
Okay.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.617
Let's see where we can start
saving you some money.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.954
One hundred and eighty dollars on a dress?

02:01.454 --> 02:02.997
Well, this is easy. From now on,

02:03.081 --> 02:05.083
you'll be buying your clothes
at the Dress Barrel.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.794
Please, Hank, you are out of your element.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.963
We are talking about
how to manage the expenses

02:10.046 --> 02:11.881
of a young, stylish woman.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.759
But I'm the cosigner on that loan of hers.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.219
I will take care of it, Hank.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.762
Luanne scares easily.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.597
That plays into my strengths.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.728
Luanne, this pie chart represents
your expenses...

02:25.812 --> 02:27.355
Food, gas, clothes.

02:27.438 --> 02:31.151
And this great big piece of pie
is credit card debt.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.611
I'll never be able to eat it!

02:33.695 --> 02:36.156
That is why you are
gonna get a second job.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.532
Here are the help wanted ads.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.533
Now go to it.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.118
I expect to see jobs circled

02:40.201 --> 02:41.703
and numbers written down.

02:41.786 --> 02:42.954
Oh, and if you come across

02:43.037 --> 02:45.498
any ironic deaths in the Obits, clip 'em.

02:45.582 --> 02:49.210
You know, piano tuner hit
by falling piano, things like that.

02:51.796 --> 02:52.839
What are you doing?

02:52.922 --> 02:54.340
I need to get another job

02:54.424 --> 02:57.093
'cause Aunt Peggy says
I have to be more responsible.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.138
Mom's into responsibility now, too?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.724
"Plumber, nurse's aid..."

03:02.807 --> 03:04.893
All these jobs are racist

03:04.976 --> 03:07.353
against people who don't have skills.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.439
Hey, how about this one?

03:09.522 --> 03:12.734
"Night work available
for outgoing, attractive girls

03:12.817 --> 03:15.737
who like to make big dollars
and have a good time."

03:15.820 --> 03:17.071
That's me!

03:18.781 --> 03:20.658
Peggy's got to show Luanne

03:20.742 --> 03:23.703
that you only use credit cards
in an emergency,

03:23.786 --> 03:26.164
not for toe rings and body glitter.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.208
Frivolous. Just frivolous.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.167
Exactly.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.085
Credit cards are a last resort,

03:31.169 --> 03:35.590
after cash, check, plasma,
urine, and alien urine.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.008
Sure, there's bone marrow,

03:37.091 --> 03:40.386
but that is more prudently used
as a retirement vehicle.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.096
Or so says Lou Dobbs.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.727
"Eighty-year-old hypnotist dies
in her sleep."

03:47.810 --> 03:50.146
How could Luanne miss this? Hm?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.357
Bobby, do you know anything about this?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.525
That's Luanne's new job.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.320
Don't tie up the phone, I'm a reference.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.506
Luanne, stop!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.841
You didn't audition
for anything yet, did you?

04:18.925 --> 04:19.759
No.

04:19.842 --> 04:21.344
Oh, my god.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.514
What kind of twisted perversion
have they trapped you into?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.267
I'm a Roller Derby skater!

04:27.350 --> 04:28.309
Roller Derby?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.812
But wait, Luanne,
how is that a second job?

04:30.895 --> 04:33.106
We make $500 a game.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.065
Really?

04:34.148 --> 04:35.316
You ready, Luanne?

04:38.778 --> 04:39.696
Pratley...

04:39.779 --> 04:42.115
what are you doing here?
I thought you sold Hyundais.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.491
I sell "fun."

04:43.574 --> 04:46.119
Doesn't matter
if it's a fully-loaded Hyundai Excel

04:46.202 --> 04:48.538
or the finest Roller Derby team in Arlen.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.623
And I'd like to see you in both.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.175
Who are those women?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.885
That's Gruesome Gretta.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.137
She's the big one.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.223
There's Carly and Felicia,
they're dancers together.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.728
That was Nureen.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.521
Nureen really likes children.

05:13.604 --> 05:14.981
Well, at least I think she does

05:15.064 --> 05:16.733
because she has a whole lot of them.

05:18.776 --> 05:20.653
Cheap shot, Gretta!

05:21.696 --> 05:23.281
Aunt Peggy, I'll save you!

05:23.948 --> 05:25.283
No, you won't!

05:31.873 --> 05:34.167
Do you have size 16 skates?

05:34.250 --> 05:35.251
Lots of 'em.

05:39.088 --> 05:41.424
Hmm, hmm.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.719
Bobby, I know
"skateboarding isn't a crime,"

05:44.802 --> 05:46.429
but it is in my driveway.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.015
Luanne? Peggy?

05:49.098 --> 05:50.641
Not Luanne and Peggy.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.144
Gold Dust and the Executionator!

05:56.898 --> 05:58.232
Dangit, Peggy.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.652
How is this teaching Luanne
about responsibility?

06:01.736 --> 06:04.655
Do... Don't roll around
while I'm talking to you.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.157
By putting on these skates,

06:06.240 --> 06:08.618
I am putting Luanne on solid footing.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.411
After playing the Maulers next week,

06:10.495 --> 06:12.705
she'll make enough
to pay down her credit card debt.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.499
After taking on the Destroyers,

06:14.582 --> 06:16.417
she will catch up on her car payments.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.629
And after beating the tar
out of those Poisonettes,

06:19.712 --> 06:22.632
she will make a deposit into
an interest-bearing account!

06:23.299 --> 06:26.052
You just wanna smash
into people, don't you?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.596
You know, Hank, the money I make

06:28.679 --> 06:30.681
could go towards buying
that patio furniture

06:30.765 --> 06:31.849
you've had your eye on.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.351
The Gatsby Collection?

06:33.434 --> 06:34.310
Yep.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.562
And I like to smash into people.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.858
After we get paid,

06:40.942 --> 06:43.778
I'm going to get my car painted
in our team colors,

06:43.861 --> 06:45.530
so I'm all matchy.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.989
You will do no such thing.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.409
Your Uncle Hank is on board by a thread.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.245
I appeased him
with some fancy patio furniture talk,

06:52.328 --> 06:55.373
but if we screw this up,
he'll still give us that look.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.999
I hate that look.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.209
We all do.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.461
Now tape these rolls
of pennies to my elbows.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.591
This sport is entirely fixed.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.635
There's a giant magnet beneath the rink

07:07.718 --> 07:09.637
that controls their every movement.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.389
That woman is perfect.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.058
She's beautiful
and could be a father figure.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.229
Hey, Lucky. Want a corn chip?

07:18.312 --> 07:19.230
No, sir.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.692
This ol' boy won't eat a corn chip
out of a bag no more.

07:22.775 --> 07:23.901
See, I used to make 'em.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.486
Had a hairnet and everything.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.779
You ain't tasted nothing

07:26.863 --> 07:29.490
till you've tasted a corn chip
right off the line.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.910
Oh, someday I would like to try that.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.247
I'm gonna help you
run down that dream, Bobby.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.751
How am I gonna get through 'em?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.420
By following these!

07:49.802 --> 07:51.929
Whoo-hoo! Nice score!

07:52.013 --> 07:53.848
Score? Someone scored?

07:53.931 --> 07:55.850
Heck, yeah! Aunt Peggy did.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.310
-Aunt Peggy?
-Yeah.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.644
She knocked out their blockers

07:58.728 --> 08:00.688
so Luanne could scoot past their jammer.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.064
I'm so confused.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.942
See, your blockers stop
the other team's jammers.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.236
The pivots can block, jam, or counter jam.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.655
Only the pivot or jammer can score.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.657
But how do they score?

08:11.741 --> 08:13.284
No one really knows.

08:15.828 --> 08:18.414
I like that new girl
on your team, Pratley.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.082
She's gonna be good for the gate.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.585
Yeah, and "Glasses" over there looks like

08:22.668 --> 08:24.086
she can knock a few heads.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.839
I'll get some toilet paper
printed up with her face on it.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.717
We'll fill the place
when you play my team next week.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.885
Whoo-hoho!

08:34.639 --> 08:36.015
Whoo-hoohoo!

08:36.098 --> 08:38.559
We won the game... or match...

08:38.643 --> 08:39.769
or whatever it's called!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.187
Knocky knocky.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.271
I hope you're decent.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.940
Oh, you are.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.608
Payday.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.444
Oh!

08:48.528 --> 08:50.404
Our paychecks! Yay!

08:52.114 --> 08:54.992
Oh, it only says $90.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.536
It should be for 500.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.037
Well, it is 500.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.872
Uh, minus operating expenses.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.792
I gotta deduct for things
like water, tissue, and bandages.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.710
And lip, if I hear any more of it.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.299
He's got no right to do that.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.385
Why do you women take that from him?

09:12.468 --> 09:14.095
It's the way it's always been.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.930
The longer we sit here and jaw about it,

09:16.013 --> 09:18.266
the more he's gonna charge us
to keep the lights on.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.691
This is the smallest check
for $500 I have ever gotten.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.693
Oh, I feel so used!

09:28.776 --> 09:30.695
Hey, that was some match last night.

09:30.778 --> 09:34.282
Shall we celebrate now
and buy a piece of patio furniture

09:34.365 --> 09:36.117
or wait and get the whole grouping

09:36.200 --> 09:37.285
at the end of the month?

09:38.786 --> 09:40.913
I say we delay gratification.

09:41.455 --> 09:44.166
Well, I do like delaying gratification...

09:44.250 --> 09:45.126
Done!

09:47.962 --> 09:50.172
How are we going to buy
Uncle Hank patio furniture

09:50.256 --> 09:52.633
when Lane Pratley barely
gives us any money?

09:53.968 --> 09:57.221
You do not know it, Luanne,
but you just had an idea.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.264
Really?

10:00.182 --> 10:01.017
<i>Ladies...</i>

10:01.100 --> 10:03.644
what I am about
to tell you will make you rich.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.313
How?

10:05.396 --> 10:08.232
We will buy
a Roller Derby team of our own.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.483
Ha!

10:09.567 --> 10:11.193
I'm gonna make you eat that word, Gretta.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.904
We will get rid of the owners,

10:13.988 --> 10:15.656
and the players will take over.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.742
We will do everything right!

10:17.825 --> 10:19.785
It would sure be nice to have some money

10:19.869 --> 10:21.370
-for child care.
-Mm-hmm.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.873
I wouldn't mind a strengthening
and conditioning coach,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.750
and Carly would like a decent boom box

10:25.833 --> 10:27.251
for psyche-up music.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.337
It's part of her process.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.049
Ladies, we will be able to have
all those things and more.

10:33.132 --> 10:35.343
All we need is faith in ourselves

10:35.426 --> 10:37.011
and a thousand dollars each.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.055
A thousand dollars sure is a lot.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.182
Are you sure we're gonna get
that money back?

10:41.265 --> 10:42.350
I guarantee it.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.602
In fact, I have a pie chart to prove it.

10:46.270 --> 10:49.315
Aunt Peggy, where are we
going to get our share?

10:49.398 --> 10:50.441
From the bank.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.568
Banks loan out money every day.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
Why shouldn't they loan it to us?

10:55.821 --> 10:57.281
I envy you, Bobby.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.075
Eating a chip off the line

10:59.158 --> 11:02.244
is one of those experiences
that changes your life.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.288
Birds fly a little slower,

11:04.372 --> 11:06.874
and pretty girls smile a little longer.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.585
It's like the whole world moves
just for you.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.004
All that from eating a corn chip?

11:12.088 --> 11:13.964
Off the line, yes.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.555
We're here to eat a chip off the line.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.849
Sir, this factory isn't open
to the public.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.476
No, it's okay.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.853
I used to work at one
of these down in Waco.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.605
Move it along, please.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.656
Don't worry, Bobby,
I'll think of something.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.367
But where are we going?

11:41.450 --> 11:44.161
Home. Thinking takes time.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.507
If they don't want customers
to wear skates inside,

11:56.590 --> 11:57.967
they should have a sign.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.178
All the money places turned us down.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.472
Even the drive-through ones.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.932
What are we gonna do now?

12:07.059 --> 12:09.395
We are gonna go over their heads.

12:11.063 --> 12:14.150
Are you sure you wanna get
a cash advance, Aunt Peggy?

12:14.233 --> 12:17.445
Because when I did,
it was really irresponsible.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.322
That is because you were
living beyond your means.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.033
I am borrowing as a business investment.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.452
But the interest!

12:24.535 --> 12:27.079
The horrible interest!

12:27.163 --> 12:28.330
Well, it is no matter to us,

12:28.414 --> 12:29.874
because we will be paying this off

12:29.957 --> 12:31.792
before the end of the month
with our profits.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.960
It's perfect.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.216
Even so, let's not mention it
to your Uncle Hank.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.057
There's my team.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.184
Thirty minutes late.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.727
'Course, I'll have to round up

12:49.852 --> 12:51.270
and fine you for the whole hour.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.063
It's easier on the computer.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.733
There's only one problem
with your computation.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.610
You don't have a team.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.737
You never gave us contracts,

12:59.820 --> 13:01.697
so we are all free agents.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.407
We started our own team!

13:03.491 --> 13:04.992
That's right, Pratley.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.952
And as the first player-owned team,

13:07.036 --> 13:09.538
we all have a vote
in how this team is run.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.957
I vote we see how fast he can run.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.627
Yeah!

13:18.923 --> 13:22.301
This is what happens
when you send a car dealer

13:22.384 --> 13:24.845
to do a department store owner's job.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.056
Whoa, whoa, this ain't just about my team.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.474
Once your girls hear about this,

13:28.557 --> 13:29.934
they're gonna want
to be on their own, too.

13:30.017 --> 13:30.935
We got to do something.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.019
Let's remember,

13:32.102 --> 13:35.272
we control the situation here.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.067
There's one thing
years of hunting has taught me.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.819
If you want to stop the pack,

13:39.902 --> 13:42.029
you need to take down the head elephant.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.198
Or talk to its husband.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.869
So, before we begin our first practice,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.746
why don't we do a warm-up skate?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.081
The blockers can go first,

13:52.164 --> 13:53.874
then the jammers, then the pivots.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.377
You blockers always put yourself first.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.754
Everyone knows we jammers do all the work.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.797
We should lead.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.384
Jammers might win games,
but pivots win championships.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.677
I'll go first.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.012
Oh.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.265
Ah, you stuck-up, little...

14:12.184 --> 14:13.185
Ladies! Ladies!

14:13.394 --> 14:15.563
There is no reason to fight anymore.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.441
As equal owners, we can solve
all our issues through voting.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.405
Okay, that is 12 ties in a row.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.866
Which leaves us
with no time left to practice.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.367
I could bring in a chicken.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.996
Whichever person the chicken runs to,
that's who wins.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.248
Well, of course,
the chicken's gonna run to you.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.708
It's your damn chicken.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.501
I vote you shut up!

14:38.127 --> 14:40.254
Oh, hey, hey, hey, calm down!

14:40.337 --> 14:42.047
We will never get anything accomplished

14:42.131 --> 14:44.091
by fighting amongst ourselves. Oh!

14:44.633 --> 14:46.260
You want some of this, cheap shot?

14:46.427 --> 14:47.887
Hey!

14:54.184 --> 14:57.062
Hank, we need to talk about
that Roller Derby team your wife bought.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.316
My wife bought a Roller Derby team?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.192
You know anything about skates?

15:02.276 --> 15:04.653
They're very delicate pieces of machinery.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.322
Accidents happen.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.033
Now, that's a metaphor.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.993
You just tell your wife to close up shop.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.037
I don't need to tell my wife anything!

15:14.038 --> 15:16.624
How did my wife buy a Roller Derby team?

15:23.339 --> 15:24.423
Oh, hi, Hank!

15:25.132 --> 15:26.342
Well, I got to run.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.719
I'm teaching Luanne how
to make dinner with leftovers.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.220
Frugal, frugal, frugal.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.640
Peggy, did you buy a Roller Derby team?

15:32.723 --> 15:33.682
What?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.267
The things you come up with.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.353
You crazy, crazy man.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.856
We all chipped in to buy it.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.733
Where the heck did you get the money?

15:42.816 --> 15:44.735
The same place I got Luanne's share...

15:45.402 --> 15:46.320
a cash advance.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.364
On our credit card?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.449
You were supposed to be teaching Luanne

15:50.532 --> 15:52.242
fiscal responsibility.

15:52.326 --> 15:55.204
God, how am I gonna face
the guys at H&R Block

15:55.287 --> 15:56.830
when they see this on our return?

15:56.914 --> 15:58.374
I know, I know!

15:58.457 --> 16:00.292
And now it's a freaking disaster.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.919
We can't agree on anything.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.129
It all seemed so easy in my head.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.507
Everybody would be everybody else's boss.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.883
How could that not have worked?

16:10.886 --> 16:12.721
How did you find out anyway?

16:12.805 --> 16:14.348
It was Gretta, wasn't it?

16:14.431 --> 16:16.433
No, Lane Pratley came by.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.227
And he was making threats.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.520
At least I think he was.

16:19.603 --> 16:21.897
He was kind of weasly and indirect.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.816
He was making threats?

16:23.941 --> 16:26.318
Wait, that means he feels threatened.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.445
Hank, I've got to go fix everything.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.824
Now, that's what you said before
you bought a Roller Derby team.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.492
That was false bravado.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.619
This is real bravado, Hank.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.745
You've got to trust me.

16:38.038 --> 16:41.000
Okay, but I'm canceling our credit cards.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.672
<i>Now, I know we all hate each other,</i>

16:46.755 --> 16:48.132
but we have too much money

16:48.215 --> 16:49.800
invested in this team to quit now.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.927
Heck, I'll go back to dirty phone talk

16:52.011 --> 16:53.220
before I skate with you all.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.513
Sit down!

16:55.556 --> 16:57.141
Lane Pratley is scared.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.352
He's scared because he thinks
our team is a cohesive unit

17:00.436 --> 17:02.646
who can show the way
to all the other skaters.

17:02.730 --> 17:05.107
He thinks we can pull together to win,

17:05.190 --> 17:08.402
and if he thinks all that,
maybe we can pretend to do it.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.155
-Do what?
-We're gonna put on a show!

17:11.238 --> 17:12.865
We will pretend to like each other

17:12.948 --> 17:15.367
just long enough to get Pratley
to buy us out.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.494
Then we never have
to see each other again.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.001
So here's my plan.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.795
I climb this fence and get you a chip.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.547
That's your plan?

17:28.630 --> 17:30.841
It took you two days to think of that?

17:30.924 --> 17:32.676
I had to cover all the angles.

17:39.892 --> 17:40.976
Are you okay?

17:41.977 --> 17:44.396
Well, I got some pain here

17:44.480 --> 17:45.981
and some suffering here.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.155
Oh, my god, all your teeth are chipped.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.742
Now, to be fair, they was
chipped before I got here.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.369
But these contusions and lacerations

17:59.453 --> 18:03.248
I place squarely at the feet
of your corn chip company.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.250
But you climbed our security fence.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.462
That attractive nuisance
is what I call Exhibit A.

18:08.545 --> 18:09.963
Now, I could sue you.

18:10.047 --> 18:13.050
My current quote is $53,000.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.259
Or...

18:22.351 --> 18:24.895
Oh... my god.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.605
Ain't it the truth?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.944
Bobby, can you drive a stick shift?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.570
And keep me awake?

Shut up.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.603
I thought we were done
playing other teams.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.689
You said they'd buy us out
before we had to skate.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.482
She says lots of things.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.026
Sorry, Aunt Peggy.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.278
I'm sure they'll be here.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.779
They'd be fools not to be here.

19:17.072 --> 19:17.948
You're up!

19:20.576 --> 19:22.119
Okay, we can do this.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.453
It's only one hour,

19:23.537 --> 19:25.372
three times a week, indefinitely.

19:26.957 --> 19:30.043
It's just like riding a bicycle
that you hate.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.129
I thought we were just
doing this for show.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.131
I ain't rolling with y'all.

19:34.214 --> 19:35.674
Yeah, the hell with this.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.927
Excuse me, ladies, a moment of your time.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.763
Actually, we were just about to go skate.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.600
But as a democratically operated team,

19:44.683 --> 19:47.102
we will vote to see
if we wanna talk to you.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.103
Uh...

19:48.187 --> 19:50.022
It's unanimous. What do you got?

19:50.105 --> 19:52.900
I got $8,000 cash money to buy your team.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.361
Wait.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.947
You want to try to buy us...

19:59.031 --> 20:00.032
with money?

20:00.115 --> 20:02.951
Are you gonna write a check
for our camaraderie?

20:03.035 --> 20:06.246
Are you gonna fill
our wallets with good times?

20:09.750 --> 20:11.168
You make me laugh.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.420
Peggy, I've sold enough Hyundais

20:13.503 --> 20:15.589
to know exactly where you're coming from.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.884
Now, I'm gonna write a number
down on a popcorn bag...

20:29.603 --> 20:32.564
I guess you ladies have a match
to skate, for me.

20:36.652 --> 20:39.404
So, we have to keep skating together?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.365
Just until I cash the check,

20:41.448 --> 20:43.533
then we'll never have to see them again.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.994
After all, we don't have contracts.

20:52.292 --> 20:53.502
Here you go!

20:53.585 --> 20:55.212
Congratulations, Luanne.

20:55.295 --> 20:57.756
Your credit cards
are now entirely paid up.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.217
Yay!

21:01.009 --> 21:02.010
Oh...
