08:50.225 --> 08:54.011
AND THE DAFFY THING ABOUT IT IS,
I PAID HIM TO DO IT.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.578
I TRUSTED YOU, COD.

08:55.622 --> 08:56.710
YEAH, YOU GOT
YOUR MONEY BACK.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.320
AND IT AIN'T STEALING

08:58.363 --> 09:00.148
IF THE THING YOU'RE STEALING
WANTS TO BE STOLEN.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.846
I HAVE QUESTIONS...
WHICH I WILL WAIT TO ASK.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.108
STRANGE.

09:04.152 --> 09:07.198
I SPENT MY LIFE
BEING ANGRY ABOUT THIS,

09:07.242 --> 09:10.071
BUT NOW,
HERE IN...UH...

09:10.114 --> 09:13.378
A LIMBO-Y NON-DENOMINATIONAL
WAY STATION.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.772
...THE ANGER HAS GONE.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.774
AND I CAN SEE
I SPENT MY LIFE

09:17.818 --> 09:20.211
LIVING IN A HAZE
OF A BROKEN HEART.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.909
I DON'T MEAN
TO STEP ON TOES,

09:21.952 --> 09:23.475
BUT SHOULDN'T SOMEONE AT
SOME POINT ASK HIM WHO DID IT?

09:23.519 --> 09:24.607
Shh!

09:24.651 --> 09:26.348
I HAVE TAMED NATURE.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.132
I HAVE STOPPED RIVERS
FROM FLOWING.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.526
BUT THERE IS ONE THING
I COULD NEVER DO,

09:30.570 --> 09:32.136
AND THAT WAS
MAKE THAT WOMAN LOVE ME.

09:32.180 --> 09:35.531
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER, STINGWELL,

09:35.575 --> 09:37.011
NEITHER COULD I.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.579
IT DOES
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.276
WHO KILLED YOU,
STINGWELL?

09:41.319 --> 09:42.886
YOU REALLY WANT
TO KNOW?

09:42.930 --> 09:45.410
IT WAS LILA ROBINSON
HERSELF.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.935
I ASSUME SHE CAME BACK
TO STEAL THE RUBY.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.241
OH, MAN. I WISH
YOU'D HAVE SAID ANYONE ELSE.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.375
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME.

09:53.418 --> 09:57.858
WHO THE HECK
IS LILA ROBINSON?

09:57.901 --> 10:00.034
SHE'S THE BABY-MAMA
THAT TOOK MY DAUGHTER.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.651
HOW CAN YOU NOT TELL ME
THAT YOU HAD A DAUGHTER?

10:08.695 --> 10:10.348
WE HAVE BURIED BODIES
TOGETHER.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.481
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER --
A DAUGHTER.

10:12.524 --> 10:14.439
I MEAN, HAVE YOU KNOWN
ALL THIS TIME AND YOU
DIDN'T TELL ME?

10:14.483 --> 10:16.572
YOU KNOW YOU AIN'T
FOOLING NOBODY, RIGHT?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.530
HUH?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.663
I KNOW
THAT EVERY SECRET I TELL YOU

10:20.707 --> 10:22.447
SPENDS ABOUT 20 SECONDS
BEING A SECRET

10:22.491 --> 10:25.842
BEFORE IT SPILLS OUT OF YOUR
MOUTH AND INTO DEAD GIRL'S EARS.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.017
NOW, THAT IS NOT TRUE.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.758
IT'S TRUE.IT'S TRUE.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.368
BUT I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

10:30.412 --> 10:32.109
WHAT ABOUT SIMONE?
DOES SHE KNOW?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.938
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A "NO."

10:34.982 --> 10:36.679
YOU KNOW, MUCH AS I'D LOVE
TO SIT HERE

10:36.723 --> 10:39.029
RUMINATING ABOUT MY PAINFUL PAST
OVER A SLICE OF PIE,

10:39.073 --> 10:41.379
CAN WE PLEASE FIND
SOMETHING ELSE TO CHATTER ABOUT?

10:41.423 --> 10:43.077
CHUCK, EMERSON
SHOULDN'T FEEL ANY PRESSURE

10:43.120 --> 10:45.209
TO DIVULGE THE HIDDEN DETAILS
OF HIS HIDDEN PAST.

10:45.253 --> 10:48.299
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'VE EVER
SHARED BIG SECRETS WITH HIM.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.692
MM-HMM.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.128
IT'S COMPLICATED.

10:51.172 --> 10:53.087
WHAT? WHAT IS SO COMPLICATED
ABOUT FINDING

10:53.130 --> 10:56.568
YOUR BABY-STEALING BABY-MAMA
AND GETTING YOUR DAUGHTER BACK?

10:56.612 --> 10:59.876
IF LILA KILLED ROLAND STINGWELL
AND STOLE THAT DAM RUBY,

10:59.920 --> 11:01.182
THEN WE HAVE
JUST BEEN HIRED

11:01.225 --> 11:02.966
TO TRACK HER DOWN
AND FIND YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:03.010 --> 11:05.752
CHUCK'S RIGHT. WE SHOULD TRACE
MR. STINGWELL'S LAST STEPS.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.015
MAYBE LILA
LEFT A TRAIL BEHIND.

11:08.058 --> 11:11.366
I'VE SPENT THE LAST SEVEN YEARS
TRACKING DOWN HER AND MY KID.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.498
LILA IS A WILY GENIUS.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.587
A MAN-EATING,
SHAPE-SHIFTING GRIFTER

11:15.631 --> 11:17.894
WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET IN
AND GET OUT AND VANISH

11:17.938 --> 11:19.809
LIKE HEAT OFF A BLACKTOP.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.463
AT LEAST WE COULD TRY.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.467
WE NEED TO TRY.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.299
AH, MAYBE I COULD
GIVE IT ONE MORE SHOT.

11:33.910 --> 11:38.349
I DON'T KNOW
YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME.

11:38.393 --> 11:41.788
PENNY.

11:41.831 --> 11:45.443
MY DAUGHTER'S NAME
IS PENNY.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.097
Narrator:
THE FACTS WERE THESE --

11:47.141 --> 11:50.971
9 YEARS, 2 MONTHS, 14 DAYS,
AND 9 MINUTES EARLIER,

11:51.014 --> 11:52.929
ROLLIE STINGWELL
HIRED THE P.I.

11:52.973 --> 11:56.498
TO TAIL HIS FIANCEE,
MS. EMILY VON ALISTAIR,

11:56.541 --> 11:59.153
WHO ROLLIE SUSPECTED
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.764
THE AFFAIR, HOWEVER,
WAS WITH A DEAD MAN --

12:01.808 --> 12:04.680
ONE HENRY DAVID THOREAU.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.249
AND HER FURTIVE TRIPS AWAY
SEEMED TO SHOW ONLY HER DESIRE

12:08.292 --> 12:10.904
FOR A MOMENT OF SOLITUDE
AND ORNITHOLOGY

12:10.947 --> 12:14.124
TO AVOID THE HUBBUB
OF WEDDING-PLANNING.

12:14.168 --> 12:17.562
BUT HIDING FROM A BIRD-WATCHER
IN A LINCOLN CONTINENTAL

12:17.606 --> 12:19.956
IS NOT EASY.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.744
AND SO EMILY VON ALISTAIR BEGAN
SHARING HER DAILY SOLITUDE,

12:24.787 --> 12:28.225
AS WELL AS HER SANDWICH
AND THERMOS OF TOMATO SOUP.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.793
WHILE UNCONVENTIONAL,
EMERSON REASONED

12:30.837 --> 12:35.015
HE WAS STILL VERY MUCH
KEEPING AN EYE ON EMILY.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.799
WITH EACH PASSING THERMOS,

12:36.843 --> 12:39.454
THE PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR
GREW MORE BLIND

12:39.497 --> 12:42.109
TO THE FACT
THAT HE WAS FAST APPROACHING

12:42.152 --> 12:46.026
THE THIN LINE BETWEEN
"STAKE OUT" AND "MAKE OUT."

12:46.069 --> 12:49.203
EMERSON HESITATED,
KNOWING IT WAS WRONG.

12:49.246 --> 12:53.511
BUT EMILY HAD A SOLUTION,
AND THAT WAS TO TELL THE TRUTH.

12:53.555 --> 12:54.817
EMERSON.
HMM?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.210
THERE'S SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL
YOU

12:56.253 --> 12:57.820
THAT I SHOULD PROBABLY
KEEP TO MYSELF.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.735
OKAY.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.347
Narrator:
EMERSON COD WOULD DISCOVER
THAT EMILY WAS LILA ROBINSON --

13:03.391 --> 13:07.656
A GRIFTER COME TO TOWN
TO STEAL STINGWELL'S DAM RUBY.

13:07.699 --> 13:10.659
SHE DID NOT LOVE
THE MILLIONAIRE AT ALL.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.313
22 DAYS LATER,

13:12.356 --> 13:15.577
THE P.I. RETURNED THE MONEY
STINGWELL HAD PAID HIM.

13:15.620 --> 13:19.146
WHAT HE COULD NOT RETURN
WAS HIS CLIENT'S FIANCEE...

13:19.189 --> 13:23.280
OR THE NEW LIFE
GROWING INSIDE HER.

13:23.324 --> 13:27.850
FURIOUS, STINGWELL SWORE IF
THE GRIFTER EVER GRIFTED AGAIN,

13:27.894 --> 13:31.332
HE'D MAKE SURE
SHE GOT PUT AWAY -- FOR GOOD.

13:31.375 --> 13:34.030
LILA PROMISED TO KEEP
ON THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW,

13:34.074 --> 13:36.293
WHILE STINGWELL WENT ON TO BUILD

13:36.337 --> 13:39.731
PAPEN COUNTY WATER & POWER
INTO A JUGGERNAUT.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.349
IF WE'RE GONNA FIND LILA,

13:48.392 --> 13:50.351
WE NEED TO RETRACE
STINGWELL'S STEPS --

13:50.394 --> 13:52.614
FIGURE OUT HOW HE ENDED UP
HALF A MILE AWAY FROM HERE.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.268
WELCOME
TO THE PAPEN COUNTY DAM,

13:54.311 --> 13:56.270
SOURCE OF PAPEN COUNTY'S
WATER AND POWER.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.706
MY NAME IS TAYLOR PHILBEAN,

13:57.749 --> 13:59.229
AND, SHOULD YOU CHOOSE
TO TAKE A TOUR

13:59.273 --> 14:01.579
OF THIS HISTORIC LANDMARK
AND WORKING UTILITY,

14:01.623 --> 14:03.190
I'LL BE YOUR "DAM" GUIDE.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.932
WHEN THERE'S A BIGGER GROUP,

14:05.975 --> 14:08.064
THIS IS WHERE I WAIT
FOR THE LAUGH TO DIE DOWN.

14:08.108 --> 14:10.588
ACTUALLY, WE'RE INVITED GUESTS
OF THE STINGWELL FAMILY,

14:10.632 --> 14:13.635
HERE ON ACCOUNT OF ROLAND
STINGWELL'S UNTIMELY DEATH.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.593
DAMN SAD IS WHAT IT IS.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.508
IF YOU'LL WAIT HERE,
I'LL GET YOU SOME VISITOR PASSES

14:17.552 --> 14:20.250
AND TAKE YOU UP
TO HIS PRIVATE OFFICE.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.905
YOU SAID LILA CHOSE TO LEAVE
BEHIND HER LIFE OF CRIME.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.341
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:24.385 --> 14:25.995
PEOPLE'S NATURE
IS LIKE A RIVER.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.084
YOU CAN ONLY KEEP IT DAMMED UP
FOR SO LONG.

14:28.128 --> 14:29.869
ONE DAY,
LILA PACKED UP HER BAGS

14:29.912 --> 14:32.045
AND BROKE BACK INTO STINGWELL'S
HOUSE LOOKING FOR THE DAM RUBY.

14:32.088 --> 14:36.136
WHEN SHE COULDN'T FIND THAT,
SHE STOLE 50 GRAND IN CASH.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.355
KNOWING STINGWELL WOULD
TRACK HER DOWN TO THE
ENDS OF THE EARTH,

14:38.399 --> 14:42.185
SHE TOOK PENNY,
AND THEY JUST DISAPPEARED.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.665
IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.275
BUT YOU KNEW
WHO LILA WAS.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.756
DID YOU REALLY
NOT SEE IT COMING?

14:47.799 --> 14:49.323
I GUESS
I WAS JUST BLINDED.

14:49.366 --> 14:51.107
Taylor: SAY "CHEESE!"
[ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ]

14:52.892 --> 14:54.676
HEY!

14:54.719 --> 14:56.852
THIS CAMERA TAKE PICTURES
OF EVERY VISITOR?

14:56.896 --> 14:58.201
YES, FOR SECURITY REASONS.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.637
SHOULD YOU BE PLANNING

14:59.681 --> 15:01.639
TO BLOW UP THE DAM
AND FLOOD THE VALLEY,

15:01.683 --> 15:03.250
ONE COPY IS KEPT ON FILE,
AND ANOTHER IS AVAILABLE

15:03.293 --> 15:06.862
FOR PURCHASE AS A KEEPSAKE
IN OUR GIFT SHOP ON THE WAY OUT.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.561
HMM.THIS WAY.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.173
HAVE YOU SEEN
THIS WOMAN BEFORE?

15:13.216 --> 15:14.739
Emerson:
NAME'S LILA ROBINSON.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.567
THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN
AS SHE WAS ENTERING THE BUILDING

15:16.611 --> 15:18.830
THE SAME DAY
YOUR BOSS WAS KILLED.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.441
I REMEMBER THE WOMAN.

15:20.484 --> 15:23.096
SHE DID HAVE A PRIVATE MEETING
WITH MR. STINGWELL,

15:23.139 --> 15:27.665
BUT I BELIEVE SHE SAID
HER NAME WAS MARYBETH ACRES.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.364
THE POLICE HAVE ALREADY
BEEN HERE ASKING QUESTIONS.

15:30.407 --> 15:33.062
THEY ASK YOU
ABOUT MARYBETH? NO.

15:33.106 --> 15:36.283
THEY WERE ASKING ABOUT THE
MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR CONTRACTS

15:36.326 --> 15:38.763
THAT MR. STINGWELL
WAS NEGOTIATING

15:38.807 --> 15:42.202
TO REPLACE ALL THE OLD PIPES
THAT BRING WATER INTO THE CITY.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.813
YEAH, I'D SAY THE POLICE
ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK.

15:44.856 --> 15:48.295
I AGREE.
I TRIED TO TELL THEM MY THEORY,

15:48.338 --> 15:50.079
BUT THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.602
I'M INTERESTED.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.343
WELL...

15:53.387 --> 15:55.432
I CAUGHT A LOCAL FACTORY

15:55.476 --> 15:59.175
DUMPING TOXIC CHEMICALS
INTO THE DAM RESERVOIR.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.916
YOU BLEW THE WHISTLE?
YOU GO, GIRL.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.138
WELL, IT'S MY DUTY AS A CITIZEN
TO WATCH THE RESERVOIR.

16:05.181 --> 16:09.011
YOU KNOW, ONE DROP
OF CERTAIN MIND-ALTERING DRUGS,

16:09.055 --> 16:11.535
AND WE'LL ALL BE ZOMBIES
UNDER THE CONTROL

16:11.579 --> 16:13.885
OF THOSE SECRET SIGNALS
ON FM RADIO.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.148
OH, BROTHER.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.106
IT'S A PUBLIC-HEALTH
ISSUE.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.934
YEAH, YEAH.
WHAT'S THIS DOOR?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.023
WELL, THAT'S MR. STINGWELL'S
PRIVATE EXIT.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.634
IT LEADS BACK
THROUGH THE INSIDE OF THE DAM

16:23.678 --> 16:25.027
TO A PRIVATE STAIRWELL.

16:27.116 --> 16:30.424
DO YOU CARE THAT I HAVE
IMPORTANT INFORMATION?

16:30.467 --> 16:34.645
OH, WE DO. WE WANT TO HEAR
ALL ABOUT YOUR THEORY.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.170
COME ON, WOMAN.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

16:37.213 --> 16:39.041
WHO YOU TALKING TO,
COD?

16:39.085 --> 16:42.175
DETECTIVE PUGET.
BEEN A WHILE.

16:42.218 --> 16:45.352
FIGURED THE STINGWELLS WOULD
HIRE A PRIVATE PEEPER
ON THIS ONE.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.223
THEY NEVER DID LIKE A COP
THEY COULDN'T BUY.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.833
YOU KNOW,
BEING COCKY IN A CHEAP SUIT

16:48.877 --> 16:50.705
IS LESS EFFECTIVE
THAN YOU THINK, PUGET.

16:50.748 --> 16:53.229
WHAT ABOUT PAPEN COUNTY'S
FINEST? THEY GOT ANY LEADS?

16:53.273 --> 16:56.015
WHO DIDN'T WANT
TO KNOCK OFF STINGWELL?

16:56.058 --> 16:58.713
YOU GOT VALUABLE RE-PIPING
CONTRACTS UP FOR GRABS,

16:58.756 --> 17:00.062
YOU GOT
100 ANGRY FARMERS

17:00.106 --> 17:02.021
WHO HAD TO COUGH UP DOUGH
FOR WATER

17:02.064 --> 17:03.370
BECAUSE HE DAMMED UP
THEIR RIVER.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.850
NOT TO MENTION A RUBY
THAT HE FLAUNTED

17:05.894 --> 17:08.201
LIKE A TROPHY WIFE
AT A HIGH-SCHOOL REUNION.

17:08.244 --> 17:12.074
HMM. WELL,
MAYBE I GOT A LEAD FOR YOU.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.337
MAYBE THE ONLY LEAD
YOU NEED TO FOLLOW.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.733
NAME'S LILA ROBINSON.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.256
LAST KNOWN ADDRESS
WAS LOCAL,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.345
BUT SHE'S BEEN ON THE FLY
FOR A WHILE.

17:22.389 --> 17:25.783
NEVER KNOWN YOU TO SHARE,
COD. WHAT'S YOUR ANGLE?

17:25.827 --> 17:27.437
MAYBE I WOULDN'T MIND
A LITTLE HELP BRINGING DOWN

17:27.481 --> 17:29.265
THE HAMMER OF JUSTICE
ON WHATEVER LOW LIFE DID THIS.

17:29.309 --> 17:31.093
DOESN'T MATTER TO ME IF
THE HAMMER'S PUBLIC OR PRIVATE,

17:31.137 --> 17:34.444
LONG AS THE NAIL GETS HIT ON
THE HEAD. YOU CATCH MY DRIFT?

17:34.488 --> 17:35.663
I DO NOT.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.189
CATCH THE BITCH.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.409
AND USE ANY AND EVERYTHING
YOU GOT, AND MOVE QUICKLY,

17:42.452 --> 17:45.325
'CAUSE I GUARAN-DAM-TEE YOU
SHE'S MOVING FAST,

17:45.368 --> 17:46.978
AND THE TRAIL'S
GETTING COLD.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.422
SIMONE.
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

17:55.465 --> 17:56.901
THERE'S SOMETHING
I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.381
THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOT TO TELL YOU, TOO.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.166
AND I REALLY HATE
TO TELL YOU NOW,

18:00.209 --> 18:01.863
BECAUSE NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M JUST TELLING YOU

18:01.906 --> 18:04.300
'CAUSE I HAVE TO,
NOT 'CAUSE I WANT TO.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.649
THAT BOOK
ON MY DESK --

18:05.693 --> 18:08.304
EMERSON,
MAY I GO FIRST?

18:08.348 --> 18:10.350
SURE.I'M SORRY.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.352
WHAT ARE YOU SORRY
ABOUT?

18:15.485 --> 18:17.226
LONG TIME, NO SEE, HONEY.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.445
LILA.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.976
Emerson: LILA."LILA"?

18:28.019 --> 18:29.717
SHE TOLD ME HER NAME
WAS PRISCILLA SALTPETER.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.762
SAID SHE'D SHOOT ME
IF I LET ON SHE WAS HERE.

18:31.806 --> 18:34.200
SHE'S TOLD A LOT OF PEOPLE
A LOT OF THINGS.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.811
YOU HERE TO SEE A DEAD MAN
ABOUT A RUBY?

18:36.854 --> 18:38.769
I'M IN TOWN TO SEE YOU.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.510
YOU REALLY SHOULD
LOCK YOUR OFFICE DOOR.

18:40.554 --> 18:43.818
NO TELLING WHAT KIND
OF RIFF-RAFF WILL BLOW IN.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.602
WHERE'S PENNY?

18:45.646 --> 18:47.474
PENNY'S SOMEWHERE
YOU CAN'T FIND HER.

18:47.517 --> 18:48.866
BUT I'LL MAKE YOU
A DEAL.

18:48.910 --> 18:52.174
I DIDN'T KILL STINGWELL
OR STEAL HIS DAM RUBY.

18:52.218 --> 18:54.611
BUT AS SOON AS THE COPS FIND OUT
THAT I WAS THERE WHEN HE WAS
KILLED,

18:54.655 --> 18:56.744
THEY'LL BE ALL OVER ME
LIKE WEEVILS ON RICE.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.311
MAYBE THEY KNOW ALREADY.

18:58.354 --> 19:01.227
THEN YOUR JOB
JUST GOT SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.837
FIND THE REAL KILLER,

19:02.880 --> 19:06.188
PUT ME IN THE CLEAR,
AND I'LL LET YOU SEE PENNY.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.972
HANG A RED LANTERN
IN YOUR OFFICE WINDOW,

19:08.016 --> 19:10.018
AND I'LL ARRANGE
FOR A REUNION.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.846
BUT THE MOMENT
I GET A WHIFF

19:11.889 --> 19:13.978
THAT THE COPS
ARE CLOSING IN ON ME,

19:14.022 --> 19:16.720
YOU WON'T SEE ME
OR YOUR PENNY AGAIN.

19:16.764 --> 19:17.634
WHO'S PENNY?

19:17.678 --> 19:19.114
PENNY'S
THE PRICE I PAID

19:19.158 --> 19:21.377
FOR THINKING WITH MY HEART
AND NOT MY HEAD.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.858
PENNY IS MY DAUGHTER.

19:23.901 --> 19:26.687
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
JUST ABOUT TO TELL YOU.

19:26.730 --> 19:27.905
SURPRISE.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.342
I'LL GIVE YOU 48 HOURS.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.822
SHE'S LYING.
IT'S IN HER EYES.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.868
SHE'S LIED SO DAMN MUCH
IN HER LIFE,

19:33.911 --> 19:35.957
HER EYES LOOK LIKE THAT
PERMANENTLY.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.133
WHAT'S TO STOP ME FROM TAKING
THAT LITTLE TOY GUN OF YOURS

19:38.177 --> 19:41.354
AND PUSHING YOUR DELICATE FRAME
THROUGH MY WALL?

19:41.397 --> 19:42.833
XYLAZINE.

19:42.877 --> 19:43.921
COME AGAIN?

19:52.408 --> 19:54.193
WAIT.
IT WAS WHAT?

19:54.236 --> 19:55.933
IT WAS
HORSE TRANQUILIZER.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.849
WHEN WE WOKE UP,
EMERSON MADE SURE I WAS
OKAY AND THEN LEFT.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.286
SAID HE WAS GONNA START
WITH ALL THE ANGRY FARMERS

20:00.329 --> 20:01.635
AND FIND OUT
WHO THE REAL KILLER WAS.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.289
BUT WE KNOW
WHO THE REAL KILLER IS.

20:03.332 --> 20:06.161
THE DEAD MAN TOLD US SO.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.250
IN SO FAR AS A DEAD MAN
COULD TELL US ANYTHING

20:08.294 --> 20:09.730
BY WAY OF
SOME VERY STRONG LEADS

20:09.773 --> 20:11.993
ACQUIRED IN A NORMAL
AND STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.604
IF LILA HAS PENNY,
THEN SHE HOLDS ALL THE CARDS.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.390
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW FOR SURE
IF LILA HAS HIS DAUGHTER.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.305
SHE COULD BE LYING
ABOUT THAT, TOO.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.959
SHE'S PLAYING HIM --
DOMINATING HIS WILL

20:22.003 --> 20:24.048
UNTIL HE'S NO LONGER
LISTENING TO HIS INSTINCTS.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.311
YOU DON'T DOMINATE EMERSON.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.834
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S OUT THERE

20:26.877 --> 20:28.227
INTERVIEWING SUSPECTS
HE KNOWS ARE INNOCENT?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.141
FOLLOWING LEADS
HE KNOWS LEAD NOWHERE?

20:30.185 --> 20:32.274
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT WHO HE IS.

20:32.318 --> 20:35.103
BUT WHAT IF WHO HE IS
ISN'T WHO HE IS RIGHT NOW?

20:35.146 --> 20:37.932
AND INSTEAD OF ANALYZING HIM,
WE SHOULD BE THERE HELPING HIM.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.455
IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW CRAZY IT SEEMS.

20:39.499 --> 20:40.935
FORGIVE ME,
BUT IF HELPING EMERSON

20:40.978 --> 20:42.850
MEANS WE ALL AGREE
TO BLIND OURSELVES TO THE TRUTH,

20:42.893 --> 20:44.591
THEN I WON'T
BE PART OF IT.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.027
WHEN SOMEONE BACKS YOU
INTO A CORNER,

20:46.070 --> 20:48.986
YOU DON'T GET OBEDIENT --
YOU BITE BACK.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.597
SIMONE, WAIT.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.294
ALL I ASKED FROM HIM
IS THAT WE START OUT

20:52.338 --> 20:54.818
WITH HONESTY AND NO SURPRISES.

20:54.862 --> 20:57.081
I WOULD SAY THIS QUALIFIES
AS A SURPRISE.

21:04.698 --> 21:06.526
THANK YOU
FOR COMING BACK, RANDY.

21:06.569 --> 21:07.701
OH, SURE.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.442
FIRST OFF,
I JUST WANT TO SAY

21:09.485 --> 21:11.139
I'M SORRY IF IT FEELS LIKE
I'M SENDING YOU MIXED SIGNALS

21:11.182 --> 21:12.619
BY ASKING YOU
TO COME BACK.

21:12.662 --> 21:14.925
WELL, I GUESS
I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED.

21:14.969 --> 21:18.538
WELL, SIGNALS ARE LIKE NUTS --
MIXED IS BETTER.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.061
AND WHO WANTS
ALL THE SAME KIND, RIGHT?

21:20.104 --> 21:21.671
[ CHUCKLES ]

21:21.715 --> 21:24.239
AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT
IS THAT WE HAVE A FRESH START.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.633
RIGHT. UM,
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

21:26.676 --> 21:27.808
MM-HMM.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.723
YOU'RE NOT JUST PLANNING
ON USING ME

21:29.766 --> 21:31.725
TO GET OVER NED,
ARE YOU?

21:31.768 --> 21:35.772
NO, NO. SOMETIMES THINGS ARE SO
ABSURD THAT I CAN'T EVEN HEAR
THEM.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.208
LIKE, YOU JUST BLEW
A DOG WHISTLE FULL OF CRAZY,

21:37.252 --> 21:39.210
AND I'M NOT A DOG.
[ CHUCKLES ]

21:39.254 --> 21:41.952
WELL, I GET THAT.
IF YOU'RE NOT READY, I GET THAT.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.651
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

21:44.694 --> 21:46.087
AAH!

21:46.130 --> 21:49.917
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
YOUR REBOUND GUY.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.745
WAIT.
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

21:54.225 --> 21:55.357
HMM. NOTHING.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.494
[ SIGHS ]
IS THIS A BAD TIME TO TALK?

22:01.537 --> 22:03.757
'CAUSE I JUST WANTED TO
SAY THAT I THINK RANDY'S
GONNA DO THE TRICK --

THE EMOTIONAL SLATE CLEAN.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.021

AFTER WORK.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.979
THAT'S GREAT, OLIVE.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.504
SEE, SOON, I'LL BE THE ONE LOST
IN SOME DISTRACTY THOUGHT,
NOT CARING,

22:11.547 --> 22:13.375
WHILE YOU PRATTLE ON ABOUT
YOUR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS.

22:13.419 --> 22:17.031
I'M SORRY. I DO CARE,
AND I AM DISTRACTY.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.250
OLIVE,
I HAVE A QUESTION.

22:19.294 --> 22:24.125
CAN LOVE MAKE YOU DO
SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY CRAZY?

22:24.168 --> 22:27.607
I WENT...
TO A NUNNERY.

22:27.650 --> 22:28.695
HAVE A GREAT TIME
TONIGHT.

22:28.738 --> 22:30.087
YEAH, I'LL DO THAT.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.961
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.354
IF EMERSON'S DESPERATE ENOUGH
NOT TO SEE THE TRUTH,

22:35.397 --> 22:36.877
HE'S DESPERATE ENOUGH
TO DO ANYTHING.

22:36.920 --> 22:37.921
HE NEEDS US.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.140
LET'S GO.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.885
Narrator:
IT WAS THE END OF A LONG DAY,

22:44.928 --> 22:47.409
AND EMERSON, CHUCK,
AND THE PIE MAKER

22:47.453 --> 22:50.281
HAD INTERVIEWED
28 DISGRUNTLED FARMERS,

22:50.325 --> 22:52.196
CONCLUDING THAT NONE WERE GUILTY

22:52.240 --> 22:54.677
OF THE MURDER
OF ROLAND STINGWELL.

22:54.721 --> 22:58.768
BUT, AS LILA HAD TOLD EMERSON,
IF HE PROVED HER INNOCENCE,

22:58.812 --> 23:01.423
HE COULD SEE HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.426
THEY MOVED ON
TO FARMER NUMBER 29.

23:04.470 --> 23:07.211
MR. BRUNT, YOU HAD ABOUT
200 ACRES OF RIVERFRONT FARMLAND

23:07.255 --> 23:09.039
BEFORE THEY BUILT THE DAM,
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

23:09.083 --> 23:11.912
MY FARM USED TO BE THE MOST
PROSPEROUS IN THE COUNTY.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.783
NOW WITH WHAT I PAY
TO TRUCK IN WATER,

23:13.827 --> 23:16.743
I CAN BARELY PAY THE RENT --
SAME AS EVERYBODY ELSE.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.875

23:18.919 --> 23:21.443
NOW, WHEN IS YOUR BIRTHDAY?DECEMBER.

23:21.487 --> 23:24.098

YOU WERE AN AUTUMN BIRTHDAY.

23:30.496 --> 23:33.412

OH, NO. I-I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.WELL, SO AM I.

23:40.767 --> 23:44.074
IF I'D KILLED STINGWELL, I
SUPPOSE I WOULD HAVE DONE IT
YEARS AGO,

23:44.118 --> 23:47.034
WHEN MY ANGER WAS FRESH-CUT,
BUT NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE.

23:47.077 --> 23:51.778
WHOEVER HAS THE WATER
HAS THE POWER.

WHAT ABOUT THE CONTRACTS TO
RE-PIPE THE COUNTY WATER SUPPLY?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.783
MIGHT BE
SOME BAD BLOOD THERE.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.654
NAH, STINGWELL WOULD HAVE BEEN
BEHIND THE PLAN,

23:58.698 --> 24:01.570
BUT THE MAYOR WOULD BE IN CHARGE
OF BIDDING OUT THE CONSTRUCTION.

24:01.614 --> 24:03.485
THERE'S NO MOTIVE.
WE GOT NOTHING.

24:03.529 --> 24:05.705

POLLUTER ANGLE?

24:05.748 --> 24:07.315

WE WERE RUNNING OUT OF LEADS

AND I WASN'T HIGH
ON LILA-BERRY JUICE,

"BIG-BUSINESS POLLUTER ANGLE"?

CRAZY ASSISTANT."

TALK TO US ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

WAS ABOUT TO MAKE PUBLIC

OF YOUR CLIENTS' FACTORIES

WAS ILLEGALLY DISPOSING

NOR WOULD THEY EVER

OF CHEMICALS INTO THE RESERVOIR.

NEARLY MONDAY.

NOT NORMALLY BE A LIABILITY,

PERSONAL COMMITMENT NOT TO LIE.

IN REGARDS TO THE CHEMICALS

25:13.642 --> 25:15.426
THAT WERE OR WERE NOT...WERE.

....DUMPED INTO THE RESERVOIR

25:22.956 --> 25:24.914
OUR PLASTICS DIVISION
HAD AN OVERFLOW.

WHICH ARE NEARLY IDENTICAL
TO PURE DRINKING WATER.

25:30.659 --> 25:34.837
PURE DRINKING WATER
WITH CHEMICALS IN IT.

25:34.881 --> 25:37.405

TO THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES.

GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

THEY FIND LILA.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.034
WHAT'S TO SAY
THEY DON'T ALSO FIND PENNY

25:58.078 --> 25:59.166
AND PUT AN END
TO ALL THIS?

25:59.209 --> 26:00.863

26:00.907 --> 26:03.605
PENNY'S THE ONLY LEVERAGE
LILA HAS.

26:03.649 --> 26:06.216

TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM.

THROUGH ANY HOOP I HAVE TO

TO GET FACE-TO-FACE
TO MY LITTLE GIRL.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.631
WHAT IF LILA'S
LYING TO YOU?

26:29.675 --> 26:31.938
WHAT IF
SHE DOESN'T HAVE PENNY?

26:31.981 --> 26:34.201
WELL, THEN,
I GUESS I'M A CHUMP.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.637
BUT AT LEAST
I'M NOT A CHUMP
