00:15.133 --> 00:17.600
Do you know what
a friend is?

00:17.600 --> 00:21.333
A friend is someone
who you really like
and care about,

00:21.333 --> 00:23.433
and friends do lots
of things together,

00:23.433 --> 00:25.500
like sing and dance.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.066
Ooh! Hey, hey!

00:27.066 --> 00:29.233
Elmo sees a friend
right now!

00:29.233 --> 00:31.967
This friend has
the same hair as you

00:31.967 --> 00:34.300
and the same eyes as you.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.967
Guess who that friend is.

00:35.967 --> 00:37.967
It's you!

00:37.967 --> 00:40.667
Aw. Elmo loves
being your friend.

00:40.667 --> 00:41.967
Now come on!

00:41.967 --> 00:44.133
Let's see more friends
on "Sesame Street"!

Oh, yeah.
I'll have my Granny Bird
send you the recipe.

01:18.400 --> 01:20.900
- That sounds great.
- Yeah. Oh.
Oh, hi, Dylan.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.734
- Hey, Dylan. Hi, Bridget.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.467
Ha ha! Oh, hey!

01:24.467 --> 01:27.467
Hi. Welcome to Ses--
Sesame Street. Um...

01:27.467 --> 01:29.333
Ugh!

01:29.333 --> 01:30.900
What are you doing, Bert?

01:30.900 --> 01:34.100
Oh, I'm looking for a place
to take a nap, Alan.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.166
Uh, why don't
you take a nap at home?

01:37.166 --> 01:41.467
Ha! Why don't I take
a nap at home, he asks.

01:41.467 --> 01:42.467
Big Bird:
Uh...

01:42.467 --> 01:44.200
Yeah.
That's right.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.333
Why don't I take
a nap at home?

01:46.333 --> 01:48.667
I was wondering
the same thing.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.033
I'll tell you why.

01:51.033 --> 01:56.467
You see, it all started
just a few minutes ago.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.900
Whee!

02:03.500 --> 02:06.567
Come on, Bert.
Let's go roller-skating. Whee!

02:06.567 --> 02:08.767
Ernie, we just went
for a bike ride.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.767
I'm really tired.

02:10.767 --> 02:13.300
I want to take a nap.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.066
A nap? But, Bert,
you love roller-skating.

02:16.066 --> 02:18.266
I am too tired
right now, Ernie.

02:18.266 --> 02:21.567
We can go roller-skating
after I take a nap.

02:21.567 --> 02:24.600
Oh. Well, okay, Bert.
Tell you what,

02:24.600 --> 02:28.066
you take a nap,
and I will wait.

02:28.066 --> 02:30.633
That's what
I was thinking.

02:34.467 --> 02:35.633

02:37.834 --> 02:39.133
Are you done
with your nap yet, Bert?

02:39.133 --> 02:41.400
Ernie, I haven't
even fallen asleep!

02:41.400 --> 02:42.834
Oh. Well, okay, Bert.
Okay.

02:42.834 --> 02:44.033
Ohh!

02:44.033 --> 02:47.667
Uh, let's see.
Hmm...

02:47.667 --> 02:49.467
Ah.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.700
Aah! Ernie! Ernie!
What are you doing?

02:55.700 --> 02:57.633
Oh, well, I'm helping you
fall asleep, Bert,

02:57.633 --> 02:59.033
with a lullaby.

02:59.033 --> 03:01.734
Ernie, you know lullabies
don't help me fall asleep,

03:01.734 --> 03:04.467
especially when
they're so loud.

03:04.467 --> 03:07.400
Well, gee, Bert, they've
always helped me fall asleep.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.300
Ohh... why me?

03:10.300 --> 03:12.066
Ohh, why me?

03:13.233 --> 03:16.066
Ah.

03:16.066 --> 03:18.200
Here, sheepy,
sheepy, sheepy.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.033
Ernie--
Ernie, what are you doing?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.900
Oh, just calling in
the sheep, Bert.

03:21.900 --> 03:24.233
No, no.
No, no, not the sheep.
Not the sheep. Ernie!

03:24.233 --> 03:25.633
Aw, but, Bert,
counting sheep

03:25.633 --> 03:27.700
will really help you
fall asleep, Bert.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.934
How many times do I have
to tell you, Ernie?

03:29.934 --> 03:32.967
Counting sheep does not
help me go to sleep!

03:32.967 --> 03:34.266
- Oh, but, Bert...
- Get away. Get away.

03:34.266 --> 03:36.333
Counting sheep always
helps me fall asleep.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.834
That's Egyptian cotton.
Get away. Get away.

03:38.834 --> 03:40.467
Whoa. Whoa!
What? Waah!

03:40.467 --> 03:42.867
- Oh, hi, Charlie.
What? Aagh!

03:42.867 --> 03:44.166
Oh, good one.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.066
I am never going
to be able to go to sleep

03:46.066 --> 03:47.533
with all this baaing.

03:47.533 --> 03:50.533
For the last time, Ernie,
I need to take a nap!

03:50.533 --> 03:52.867
Oh, but, well, gee, Bert,
you sound angry.

03:52.867 --> 03:54.233
I am angry!

03:54.233 --> 03:57.467
- Oh.
- Mmph! D'ah!

03:57.467 --> 03:58.900
Where are you going,
Bert?

03:58.900 --> 04:03.533
I am going to try
and find someplace quiet!

04:05.266 --> 04:06.867
Aww.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.333
Uh! Could somebody please
open the door for me?

04:11.333 --> 04:13.233
- Aagh!
- Oh, no.

04:14.700 --> 04:18.800
And that is why I am looking
for someplace Ernie-free

04:18.800 --> 04:20.500
to take a nap.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.633
But you always
take your nap at home.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.934
Yeah, and Ernie's
your best friend.

04:24.934 --> 04:30.033
How can I even be
okay friends with someone
who makes so much noise?

04:30.033 --> 04:33.000
Oh, hey, I know
how you feel, Bert.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.367
You know, sometimes
Snuffy slurps his soup

04:35.367 --> 04:37.233
through his snuffle,
and I don't like it.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.100
It's very loud.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.266
- Yeah.

04:40.266 --> 04:42.100
Oh, well, I sing...

04:42.100 --> 04:43.567
♪ La la la la ♪

04:43.567 --> 04:45.166
so I can't hear him.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.767
Oh, then he can slurp
all he wants,

04:46.767 --> 04:48.900
and we can still be
best friends.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.967
- Huh.
- Yep. Big Bird's right, Bert.

04:50.967 --> 04:52.800
You know, sometimes friends
don't get along,

04:52.800 --> 04:55.000
and that's okay,
but what's important

04:55.000 --> 04:57.233
is that you learn
how to make up.

04:57.233 --> 04:59.734
I mean, don't you want to try
to make up with Ernie?

04:59.734 --> 05:03.734
Right now, I'm tired.
All I want is to take a nap.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.867
Oh, sometimes I think
Ernie and I

05:05.867 --> 05:07.600
are just too different
to be friends.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.767
Alan:
All right.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.767
Maybe after your nap,
you'll feel differently.

05:11.767 --> 05:13.667
All right, you guys.
I got to go to work, all right?

05:13.667 --> 05:15.133
Good luck, Bert.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.600
Bye, Alan.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.033
Ohh...

05:18.033 --> 05:21.533
Hmm, you know, Bert,
you could take a nap in my nest.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.300
It's great for napping.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.867
Huh. I've never napped
in a nest before.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.133
Sure. I'll give it a try.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.200
Okay. Do you need
a hand with the bed?

05:29.200 --> 05:31.533
Oh, yeah, please,
but careful, it's
pretty heavy.

05:31.533 --> 05:33.266
Okay.

05:35.533 --> 05:37.467
Uh...
right behind you.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.300
You know, this is
very comfortable, Big Bird.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.700
Oh, I told you.

05:42.700 --> 05:45.000
My nest is
a great place to nap.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.700
Radar thinks so, too,
don't you, Radar?

05:47.700 --> 05:49.000
- Ah ah ah!
- Ha ha ha!

05:49.000 --> 05:50.266
Ahh...

05:50.266 --> 05:52.200
- Aah aah!

05:52.200 --> 05:53.767
Wha--
what's going on?

05:53.767 --> 05:55.934
Oh, these are my bird friends
Hannah and William.

05:55.934 --> 05:59.133
They want to take a nap, too.
They love my nest.

05:59.133 --> 06:01.467
Well... all right.

06:02.767 --> 06:05.500
- Caw! Caw!
- Aah! Aah! Aah!

06:05.500 --> 06:08.000
Make room
for Harry and Sally.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.500
But there is no room.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.500
Oh, there's always room.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.500
- Uh! But this is--

06:13.500 --> 06:14.867
See?

06:14.867 --> 06:17.033
Now can everybody scooch over
a little bit, please?

06:17.033 --> 06:18.400
Scooch over?

06:18.400 --> 06:19.700
Yeah.
It's my naptime, too, Bert.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.734
What? No. No.
No, no, Big Bird.

06:21.734 --> 06:23.367
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:23.367 --> 06:24.367
No?

06:24.367 --> 06:27.166
No. No.
I am sorry, Big Bird.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.300
I really appreciate
the hospitality,

06:29.300 --> 06:32.967
but this just isn't
going to work.

06:32.967 --> 06:34.467
Birds:
Aww.

06:34.467 --> 06:37.633
Bert:
Huh! Uh! Rrgh! Ugh!

06:37.633 --> 06:41.033
Uh! Ah! Mm! Mmm!

06:41.033 --> 06:43.367
Mmm! Hee-yah! Hngh!

06:44.700 --> 06:46.567
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.533
You want to take
your nap here

06:48.533 --> 06:50.000
in Hooper's Store?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.433
You don't mind,
do you, Alan?

06:51.433 --> 06:54.233
It's so nice
and quiet here.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.400
I'm not sure this
is the best place

06:56.400 --> 06:58.266
for you to take your nap.

06:58.266 --> 07:00.834
You won't even know
I am here, Alan.

07:00.834 --> 07:01.934
Ahh...

07:03.533 --> 07:05.467
Delivery!

07:05.467 --> 07:09.166
Oh, those must be
the bananas I'm expecting.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.200
- Waah!
- Woman: Whoa!

07:11.200 --> 07:14.767
Aah! Ah! What was that?
What was that? What--

07:14.767 --> 07:17.333
Huh. Well,
if you ask me,

07:17.333 --> 07:21.133
that's not a very great
place for a bed, fella.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.133
You know, she's right.

07:23.133 --> 07:26.700
The middle of the store
is not a good place
to take a nap, Bert.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.066
If I can't sleep here,

07:28.066 --> 07:30.100
I need to find
some other place to sleep.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.734
I need to take a nap, Alan.

07:32.734 --> 07:34.233
You know what?

07:34.233 --> 07:37.233
I have a nice,
quiet spot for you.

07:37.233 --> 07:40.266
- Yeah. Come on. Waah!

07:40.266 --> 07:41.633
Oh, watch
the bed legs, Alan.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.133
They kind of stick out
a little.

07:43.133 --> 07:46.500
Ohh, boy, I miss
old buddy Bert.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.900
I can't understand
why he got so angry.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.633
Well, maybe it's because
you played the trumpet

07:51.633 --> 07:53.500
and kept him from
na-a-a-a-apping.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.133
And because
you brought us in.

07:56.133 --> 07:59.200
But I never thought old buddy
Bert would get this angry.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.233
Does it mean we can't
be friends anymore?

08:01.233 --> 08:03.700
Of course
you can still be friends.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.433
- Sure.

08:05.433 --> 08:08.200
When I have a fight
with my friend Curly here,

08:08.200 --> 08:12.033
I think about what I did
and how I made her feel,

08:12.033 --> 08:15.867
and then I tell her
"I'm sorry" like this.

08:15.867 --> 08:18.400
Baa baaaa.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.000
And what did you say?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.734
Oh, I said, "I'm sorry
I made you angry

08:22.734 --> 08:24.166
and we got in a fight.

08:24.166 --> 08:27.734
I won't do it again.
Can we still be friends?"

08:27.734 --> 08:30.033
Baaa baa baa baaa.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.834
Baa baa baa
baa baa baaaa.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.533
Baa baa baa baa,
baa baaa.

08:33.533 --> 08:36.133
Ah, and what did she say?

08:36.133 --> 08:38.100
- Yes.
- Wow!

08:38.100 --> 08:39.834
That gives me an idea.

08:39.834 --> 08:43.834
I should go and find Bert
and tell him I'm sorry, too.

08:43.834 --> 08:46.166
I think that's
a great idea.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.967
- Oh, here I come, Bert.
- Go get him, Ernie.

08:48.967 --> 08:51.934
- Yeah. Go on, Ernie.
- That's the spirit.
Bye-bye!

08:51.934 --> 08:55.400
Bert:
Yes. Yes.
Great idea, Alan.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.066
This is the perfect place
for a nap,

08:58.066 --> 08:59.734
so quiet and peaceful.

08:59.734 --> 09:00.967
Yeah. Oh!

09:00.967 --> 09:02.100
- Okay.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.333
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.
- There.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.767
No one is gonna
bother you up here.

09:06.767 --> 09:08.066
Ahh, yeah.

09:08.066 --> 09:09.467
Sweet dreams.

09:09.467 --> 09:12.100
Ahh...

09:12.100 --> 09:15.867
Ohh... uh!

09:15.867 --> 09:18.700
Oh, it's no use, Alan.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.033
Wait.
What's the matter?

09:20.033 --> 09:22.433
I'll never be able
to sleep up here.

09:22.433 --> 09:24.467
But it's so nice
and quiet.

09:24.467 --> 09:26.567
It's too quiet, Alan.
I'm used to--

09:26.567 --> 09:28.300
I'm used to Ernie.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.667
I'm used to his bed

09:51.133 --> 09:52.967
I'm sorry

go roller-skating.

still want to be friends, Bert?

Of course!
I mean, that is,

10:05.200 --> 10:07.367
if you still want
to be my friend.

10:07.367 --> 10:10.300
Oh, well, Bert,
sure, I do.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.367
In fact, you know
what I'm gonna do?

10:12.367 --> 10:14.834

- Yes.
- Yes.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.533
Whoa!
And where did you meet?

13:40.533 --> 13:41.767
- School.
- At school.

13:41.767 --> 13:43.700

Ooh, is school

13:43.700 --> 13:45.133

14:03.200 --> 14:05.900
Say a guy like me
wanted to make a new friend.

14:05.900 --> 14:06.934
How could he do it?

14:06.934 --> 14:09.367
You could go
to a playground.

14:09.367 --> 14:11.500
Go to a playground.
And what would I do there?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.800
Well, if you had nobody
to play with,

14:13.800 --> 14:18.233
you could see somebody that
also has nobody to play with

14:18.233 --> 14:20.400
and ask them,
"Can I play with you?"

14:20.400 --> 14:22.433
That's all I have to do,
say, "Can I play with you?"

20:38.500 --> 20:42.734
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.700
Wait for it.

20:44.700 --> 20:47.500
Wai-ai-ait for it.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.800
Huh?
Oh, oh, oh!

20:48.800 --> 20:50.066
Both:
Hi!

20:50.066 --> 20:52.800
Friends!
Oh, hi, Abby.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.900
- Hi, Rosita.
- Both: Hi, Elmo!

20:54.900 --> 20:57.200
Boy,
Elmo loves friends.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.367
Oh, and Elmo wants
to find out more about them.

21:01.367 --> 21:04.533
Let's ask Elmo's friend,
Smartie.

21:04.533 --> 21:05.967
Let's call her together.

21:05.967 --> 21:09.367
Elmo and kids:
Oh, Smartie!

21:09.367 --> 21:11.000
Oh, ho ho!

21:11.000 --> 21:14.367
Hiya, Elmo, or should I say--
hiya, friend!

21:14.367 --> 21:16.900
- Ha ha!
- I'm so excited!

21:16.900 --> 21:17.934
Know why, know why?

21:17.934 --> 21:19.567
Oh, oh!
Why, why, why, why?

21:19.567 --> 21:22.100
Because today
is all about...

21:22.100 --> 21:23.433
Both:
Friends!

21:23.433 --> 21:24.767
Yeah, baby!

21:24.767 --> 21:27.867
Oh, Elmo wants to learn
more about friends.

21:27.867 --> 21:29.600
What do we do
to learn something new?

21:29.600 --> 21:32.100
All:
We look it up!

21:32.100 --> 21:36.467
Ha ha!
Let's look up
friends together.

21:36.467 --> 21:39.233
A friend is someone
you care about and play with.

21:39.233 --> 21:40.734
You can have all
kinds of friends.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.533
Elmo:
Ooh! Tell us more, Smartie.

21:42.533 --> 21:45.767
Smartie:
Friends can be young,
friends can be old.

21:45.767 --> 21:47.800
Animals can be
your friends, too.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.867
Elmo:
Boy, there are
so many different kinds

21:48.867 --> 21:50.133
of friends.

21:50.133 --> 21:51.734
What else do friends do?

21:51.734 --> 21:55.600
Smartie:
Friends help each other
and play together.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.266
Basically, friends
are the best.

21:58.266 --> 21:59.867
Wow!

21:59.867 --> 22:03.200
Thanks for helping Elmo
learn more about friends,
Smartie.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.867
That's what friends are for!

22:04.867 --> 22:06.333
See you later, Elmo!

22:06.333 --> 22:07.467
Bye-bye!

22:07.467 --> 22:10.834
Boy, Elmo loves
learning about friends.

22:10.834 --> 22:13.400
That gives Elmo an idea.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.200
Oh, ho!
Let's play a game together.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.200
Yeah!

22:17.200 --> 22:18.467
Come on, come on.

22:18.467 --> 22:20.500
Ha ha ha!

22:25.400 --> 22:28.033
Boy, Elmo wishes he had
a friend to play

22:28.033 --> 22:29.900
tic-tac-toe with!

22:29.900 --> 22:31.633
Did you say
you needed a friend?

22:31.633 --> 22:33.900
Yeah! Hi, Smartie!

22:33.900 --> 22:35.967
Ooh! Do you want
to be the Os?

22:35.967 --> 22:37.333
Oh, yeah.

22:37.333 --> 22:39.333
I love tic-tac-toe.

22:39.333 --> 22:42.266
Well, o-kay!
Let's play!

22:42.266 --> 22:45.834
Elmo:
The first person to get
three in a row wins!

22:45.834 --> 22:48.066
Elmo will go here.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.467
Smartie:
Good move, Elmo.

22:49.467 --> 22:51.633
Hmm. I'll go here.

22:51.633 --> 22:53.633
Elmo:
Okay. Here.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.033
Yeah!

22:55.033 --> 22:56.233
Two in a row!

22:56.233 --> 22:58.266
Kid:
Two in a row!
Only one left!

22:58.266 --> 23:00.400
Smartie:
Oh, no, you don't.

23:00.400 --> 23:01.734
Kid:
You blocked him!

23:01.734 --> 23:03.800
Elmo:
Oh, good one.
Elmo's turn.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.066
Smartie:
What should I do?

23:07.867 --> 23:10.133
Kids:
Tic-tac-toe,
three in a row!

23:11.567 --> 23:12.767
Oh, ho ho ho!

23:12.767 --> 23:14.433
Great game, Elmo.

23:14.433 --> 23:16.600
It's fun playing
together with friends.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.000
Aw, thank you,
Smartie.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.967
Hey. Let's play
again soon, okay?

23:19.967 --> 23:21.000
Catch you later.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.200
Oh, ho ho ho!
Bye-bye!

23:23.200 --> 23:25.934
Boy, there's so many
different things to learn

23:25.934 --> 23:27.266
about friends.

23:27.266 --> 23:31.867
Ooh! And that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:31.867 --> 23:35.000
How does Mr. Noodle
play with a friend?

23:35.000 --> 23:36.734
Hey.
Let's go ask him, okay?

23:36.734 --> 23:40.266
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:40.266 --> 23:43.734
Oh, ho ho ho!
It's Mr. Noodle's brother

23:43.734 --> 23:45.400
Mr. Noodle!

23:45.400 --> 23:47.633
Oh, and his
friend, Schmoodle!

23:47.633 --> 23:51.900
- Hi, Mr. Noodle,
hi, Schmoodle!

23:51.900 --> 23:55.567
Oh, Mr. Noodle, how do
you play with a friend?

23:55.567 --> 23:58.600
Kid:
Yeah! Show us how
to play with Schmoodle.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.166
Elmo:
Uh-huh.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.133
Kid:
No. That's not playing.

24:04.133 --> 24:06.300
Kid #2:
That's sleeping!

24:08.000 --> 24:10.633
Elmo:
Oh, oh, oh!
Wake up, sleepy!

24:10.633 --> 24:13.233
That's not how you play,
Mr. Noodle.

24:13.233 --> 24:17.467
Show us how you play
with Schmoodle!

24:19.400 --> 24:22.166
Kid:
You're dancing with a ball.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.166
Kid #2:
That's not how you play
with a friend.

24:24.166 --> 24:26.166
Elmo:
Oh, come on, Mr. Noodle.

24:26.166 --> 24:30.066
Play with Schmoodle.

24:30.066 --> 24:32.567
Yeah! That's it,
Mr. Noodle!

24:32.567 --> 24:34.000
Kid:
You're doing it!

24:34.000 --> 24:35.800
That's how you play
with a friend!

24:35.800 --> 24:37.467
Oh, ho ho! Look!

24:37.467 --> 24:41.033
Mr. Noodle is playing fetch
with Schmoodle.

24:41.033 --> 24:43.700
Oh, ho ho! Great playing,
Mr. Noodle.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.066
Bye-bye! Ooh.
Bye, Schmoodle.

24:46.066 --> 24:50.166
Boy, learning new things
makes Elmo so happy,
