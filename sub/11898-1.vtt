Uncle Scotty was here last night?

10:17.458 --> 10:19.528
Yeah, he was here, but he couldn't stay.

10:19.617 --> 10:22.948
But he told me to tell you that he misses you
and he can't wait to see you.

10:24.838 --> 10:27.718

out how to make that water mill work?

What?

10:29.069 --> 10:30.507
Is there a problem?

10:30.508 --> 10:33.569
He had a run-in with some kids at school.

10:33.659 --> 10:35.188
What kind of a run-in?

10:35.189 --> 10:39.958
Well, he brought his project in
to show the teacher,

10:40.049 --> 10:43.198
Did your teacher see what these kids did?

10:43.289 --> 10:45.088
No.

10:45.089 --> 10:47.879
And I have to start all over.

10:47.969 --> 10:50.489
Ijust wanna kill them.

10:50.580 --> 10:52.468
But you're not gonna, right?

10:52.469 --> 10:54.359
Because you're smarter than that.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.068
I don't wanna be smart.

10:56.069 --> 11:02.069
I wanna be strong like you
and kick their asses.

11:03.810 --> 11:08.310
Well, guess what, buddy?

11:08.401 --> 11:13.530
You are gonna kick their asses,

11:13.620 --> 11:15.620
'Cause you know what fighting gets you?

More fighting and more fighting,
until you're old and tired.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.901
And then someone
who's younger and stronger comes along

11:21.991 --> 11:24.421
and they beat the snot out of you.

11:24.511 --> 11:27.571

12:46.325 --> 12:48.124
- Call an ambulance.
- Okay.

12:48.125 --> 12:54.125
Quickly, huh?

12:54.335 --> 13:00.335
What the hell have you gotten yourself into?

13:12.606 --> 13:17.107
Well?

13:17.197 --> 13:20.347
(SIGHS)

13:20.437 --> 13:22.146

three cracked ribs, broken nose,

13:26.467 --> 13:29.077
and some ligament damage.

13:29.167 --> 13:35.167
I'm so sorry, honey.

13:36.907 --> 13:40.507

that those guys were trying to kill him.

13:40.597 --> 13:42.938
You mean this Danny G
that you've been talking about?

13:43.027 --> 13:45.027
Yeah.

13:45.097 --> 13:47.438
It seems like he didn't take a dive in a fight
where he was supposed to,

13:47.528 --> 13:51.398
as well as running out on him.

13:51.488 --> 13:54.818

13:54.909 --> 13:57.968

14:01.208 --> 14:03.008
I have no idea, actually.

14:03.009 --> 14:06.519
But whatever it is, he doesn't have it.

14:06.608 --> 14:10.300
What's he gonna do?

14:10.389 --> 14:16.149
What are we gonna do?

14:16.239 --> 14:21.820
I guess we'll just lie low for a while.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.252

these last couple days.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.691
I'm good.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.491
Okay, well, uh...

15:12.492 --> 15:14.111
Anyways, I got a guy out front.

15:14.112 --> 15:18.973
Said he wants to talk to you
about a fractured radius?

15:19.063 --> 15:24.823
I don't... I don't even know what that is.

15:24.912 --> 15:26.912
You want me to handle this?

15:26.982 --> 15:29.053
No.

15:29.143 --> 15:35.143
- I've got it. You wait here.
- All right.

15:38.233 --> 15:41.113
Long time. You got a minute?

15:42.733 --> 15:44.173
Kind of busy right now.

15:44.174 --> 15:47.324
Not too busy to talk to Danny, are you?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.213
I've got nothing to say to him.

15:49.214 --> 15:52.185
You sure?
Maybe you two could talk about the old days.

15:52.274 --> 15:53.713
Reminisce and stuff.

DANNY G:
Tell your boy to put the phone down.

16:48.347 --> 16:50.867
I got business to discuss.

16:50.957 --> 16:55.097
So as you may have well heard by now,
I got a little problem with your brother.

16:55.187 --> 16:59.688
I don't know anything about
what goes on with you and Scotty.

16:59.777 --> 17:05.718
I know the room number,

17:05.808 --> 17:07.246
So what do you want?

17:07.247 --> 17:09.858
- I want my money.
- You took his money.

17:09.948 --> 17:13.458
That ain't even a long stick on a short hill
of what that mutt owes me.

17:13.548 --> 17:15.888
For one fight? So he'll pay you back.

17:15.978 --> 17:21.738
One fight? That's what he told you?
He's been sucking cash out of me for months.

17:21.828 --> 17:25.789
Sixty-tvvo K to be exact.

17:25.877 --> 17:27.768
And the way I figure it,
his debts are your debts,

17:27.769 --> 17:31.549
you being people and all.

17:31.638 --> 17:33.979
I don't have that kind of money.

17:34.069 --> 17:40.069
I'm not talking about sitting around here
for the next 40 fucking years

17:40.640 --> 17:43.160
I'm talking about a Shane Slavin comeback.

17:43.249 --> 17:46.670
(SCOFFS) You're out of your mind.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.760
I don't fight anymore.

17:48.830 --> 17:50.539
Well, you could have fooled me.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.150
Arn over here's still got a headache.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.930
With a little training, who knows?
Besides, everybody loves a comeback.

17:57.020 --> 17:59.721
No way. It's not gonna happen.

17:59.810 --> 18:01.880
That's pretty whimsical.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.500
Looky here.

18:03.501 --> 18:05.841
You fight again,
you get your brother off the hook.

18:05.931 --> 18:09.261
I make some cash, you make some cash.

18:09.350 --> 18:13.491
And your family you can't say wouldn't
be happy with a little bit of loot, right?

18:13.581 --> 18:15.380
You keep my family out of this.

18:15.381 --> 18:19.252
Now, how am I gonna do that?

18:19.341 --> 18:23.481
Everybody's rolled
into a little ball like a bunch of kittens.

18:23.571 --> 18:26.902
Are you threatening me?
Are you threatening my family?

18:26.992 --> 18:29.512
Now, that's a glass-half-empty way
of looking at it.

18:29.602 --> 18:31.581
I'm offering you a choice.

18:31.582 --> 18:34.102
You fight, or I am gonna hound,

18:34.192 --> 18:38.332
I am gonna dog your brother
right into a pine box.

18:38.422 --> 18:40.422
And don't think about
squirreling him away someplace,

18:40.492 --> 18:43.462
'cause I will get my 64K.

18:43.553 --> 18:44.991
You said 62.

18:44.992 --> 18:48.772
Yeah, well now there's a little bit of vig
for me suffering the goddamn degradation

18:48.863 --> 18:51.833
for coming down to this shithole
and talking to you.

18:51.923 --> 18:54.173
Now think about it. Get out.

He never thinks of anybody but himself!

19:00.654 --> 19:02.813
I mean, when the hell is he gonna grow up?

19:02.903 --> 19:04.973
I'm sick and tired
of all the messes he gets into.

19:05.064 --> 19:07.314
And I'm sick and tired
of taking care of him all my life.

19:07.403 --> 19:09.744
And now what?
I'm supposed to give up my life for him?

19:09.833 --> 19:14.154
We can leave.
We'll take James, we'll get out of here.

19:14.244 --> 19:16.494
- We'll lose everything.
- We'll make it.

19:16.584 --> 19:20.184
Look, Connie, I don't have
a lot of marketable skills.

19:20.274 --> 19:22.074
And I'm not going to make a living
as a grease monkey

19:22.075 --> 19:23.603
working at somebody else's place.

19:23.604 --> 19:25.494
So you wanna get beat up for a living?

19:25.495 --> 19:27.204
You saw what happened to your brother.

19:27.205 --> 19:29.455
He was stupid. He tried to cut out on Danny.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.885
They nearly killed him, Shane.

19:31.975 --> 19:35.035
Look, Con, it's just a few fights

19:35.125 --> 19:40.705
until this nightmare is over
and then we'll get our lives back.

19:40.796 --> 19:42.796

I just don't see we have any other choice.

till you get it done.

20:22.377 --> 20:23.636
It's all for the new venue.

vanilla since you quit this business.

they gotta go underground.

20:47.489 --> 20:49.738
What, you get tired of fixing fenders?

20:49.829 --> 20:51.717
So how much do I make for each fight?

20:51.718 --> 20:55.229
Seven K each fight only if you win.

20:55.319 --> 20:57.839
So we're talking about

20:57.930 --> 20:59.458
nine fights?

20:59.459 --> 21:05.459
Only if you win.
Then again, you fix your brother's debt,

21:07.559 --> 21:10.350
I'm only doing this
till Scotty's debt is cleared.

21:10.439 --> 21:13.410
