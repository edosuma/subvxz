WEBVTT

00:07.298 --> 00:10.885
I want a Declaration, Roger.
So we can send them in.

00:10.969 --> 00:14.097
<i>- </i><i>But, Madam President...</i>
- I have the Guard, FEMA and the EPA

00:14.180 --> 00:16.808
mobilized and waiting
on the outskirts of that town.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.685
<i>I just got off the phone
with the refinery.</i>

00:18.768 --> 00:20.895
<i>The leak is well on its way
to burning off.</i>

00:21.813 --> 00:24.733
My understanding is that the air quality
is dangerous.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.110
The levels are somewhat elevated, yes,

00:27.193 --> 00:30.155
- but the winds are in our favor.
<i>- And subject to change.</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:31.823
<i>That's how wind works.</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:34.075
This will all be over in a day or two,

00:34.159 --> 00:36.661
the idea of keeping these families out
of their homes...

00:36.745 --> 00:38.663
<i>This is a prudent precaution</i>

00:38.747 --> 00:41.332
<i>and on my watch,
that’s what I want to happen.</i>

00:41.416 --> 00:43.418
I don’t think we should
exaggerate the situation.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.840
Do you remember where you were
on election night, Governor?

00:50.383 --> 00:51.676
<i>Because I do.</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:53.970
<i>You were going to lose.</i>

00:54.846 --> 00:58.933
Statistically, there is no reason
you should have won.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.956
<i>Keep the phone away from your mouth
while you’re thinking, Governor.</i>

01:04.980 --> 01:06.357
<i>I can hear you breathing.</i>

01:07.984 --> 01:08.984
Yes.

01:11.196 --> 01:14.824
I do believe I need to declare
a state of emergency.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.287
Of course, it's your call.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.874
And I assure you,
you will have the full support

01:22.957 --> 01:24.292
of the federal government.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.048
I promised myself I wouldn't be like him.

01:30.381 --> 01:32.383
That was textbook Francis, wasn't it?

01:33.259 --> 01:37.097
But he handed me over to them
like a shaker of salt

01:37.180 --> 01:38.807
and now they won't let go.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.936
This is a wound of their own making.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.607
Mr. Vice President?

01:50.860 --> 01:51.860
Yeah, come in.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.866
Do you need a moment, sir?

01:57.200 --> 01:59.244
No, no.

02:00.036 --> 02:01.036
What is it?

02:05.875 --> 02:06.875
Okay. Governor?

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.937 --> 03:50.188
They said it was fine.

03:50.647 --> 03:54.400
It smelled like rotten eggs and trash.
That’s all.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.486
You could smell it coming out
of the faucet.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.323
And then my son, his...
his nose started to bleed and I thought,

04:00.406 --> 04:02.687
- "Is that related?"
- Where is your little boy right now?

04:02.742 --> 04:05.370
Now? He's in triage with his mom.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.499
- He's my heart, that little guy.
- No, I know. I know.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.584
But, ma'am. If I may. You...

04:11.668 --> 04:13.836
You have to tell us.
Is this real or not?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.798
Because at first they said that
we don't need to evacuate,

04:16.880 --> 04:18.067
and then all of a sudden that we should.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.851
I want you to know everything
is going to be all right. I promise you.

04:20.885 --> 04:23.680
We were relying on that plant
to keep us informed.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.390
Sir, you and your safety

04:26.140 --> 04:27.642
is the most important thing.

04:27.725 --> 04:30.770
In fact, all of the families of Bellport,

04:31.604 --> 04:33.231
nothing else matters.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.693
I want to give my thanks
to Governor Olmstead

04:36.985 --> 04:39.279
for his quick and decisive act
this morning

04:39.362 --> 04:41.239
in declaring a state of emergency.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.117
We have FEMA, we have EPA,

04:44.200 --> 04:46.286
the Ohio National Guard.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.537
They're all here.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.374
No one should ever feel unsafe.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.751
In her own home.

04:54.961 --> 04:59.041
<i>And how is it you have no idea, Mark?</i> - <i>It doesn't matter.</i>
<i>- Oh, it does matter.</i>

04:59.799 --> 05:01.926
<i>It speaks to this untenable arrangement.</i>

05:02.010 --> 05:04.470
<i>Later, I said. Let’s stay
focused on our response.</i>

05:04.554 --> 05:06.389
She was all set to sign the bill
this morning.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.659
We had photographers,
a press pool waiting, the whole thing.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.412
<i>- But she didn't sign it, did she?
- I'm on my way there now.</i>

05:11.436 --> 05:14.814
Because she was too busy manufacturing
an emergency out of nothing.

05:14.897 --> 05:17.483
<i>Look, let’s not forget
who escalated this. Okay?</i>

05:17.567 --> 05:18.568
Excuse me?

05:18.651 --> 05:20.278
<i>If we're working together, Bill,</i>

05:20.361 --> 05:22.447
<i>I need to be included in every decision.</i>

05:22.780 --> 05:24.574
<i>Every one.</i>

05:24.657 --> 05:26.200
<i>This conversation's over.</i>

05:26.284 --> 05:28.119
Oh, for God's sakes.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.682
<i>I'll join Annette in Bellport.</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:30.955
<i>No, you won’t.</i>

05:31.039 --> 05:32.957
<i>One of you showing up on site
is bad enough.</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:34.917
Annette, call me back.

05:36.794 --> 05:37.794
Mark.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.422
Mark, are you still there?

05:40.673 --> 05:41.673
Yes.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.260
<i>Let me talk to him. I'll circle back.</i>

05:57.940 --> 05:59.275
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

06:00.568 --> 06:02.195
My name is Kelsey Stewart.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.489
I'm the deputy press secretary,

06:04.572 --> 06:06.699
and I will be taking your questions today.

06:07.742 --> 06:08.742
Sarah.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.079
Is it true that Governor Olmstead
was resistant

06:11.162 --> 06:12.955
to declaring a state of emergency?

06:13.039 --> 06:15.541
<i>The Governor did declare
a state of emergency,</i>

06:15.625 --> 06:16.834
and the White House concurs.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.795
Something very wrong happened
in that plant.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.253
Yes.

06:20.296 --> 06:24.425
Arcas has been slow to provide any details
when it comes to the leak and explosion.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.469
Not to mention the two lives lost
in the accident.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.888
Have they been cooperating
with the White House?

06:28.971 --> 06:30.765
Now that the president is on the ground,

06:30.848 --> 06:33.309
it seems that, yes,
they have been more agreeable.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.479
Uh...
That's not the real question, though.

06:37.271 --> 06:40.858
<i>Somebody might want to ask, where is
Shepherd Unlimited in all of this?</i>

06:40.942 --> 06:44.320
<i>The Arcas Refinery is a subsidiary
of the family’s conglomerate.</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:47.407
<i>Are you saying that the Shepherds
are personally aware</i>

06:47.490 --> 06:48.741
<i>of problems at the plant?</i>

06:49.117 --> 06:50.952
<i>Who is responsible and how</i>

06:51.035 --> 06:54.122
<i>is all the White House and the president
are trying to find out at this point.</i>

06:55.748 --> 06:56.874
Will this have any effect

06:56.958 --> 06:59.252
on the regulatory bill
on the president's desk?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.254
The president will be speaking
on that shortly.

07:01.796 --> 07:02.796
Marcus.

07:03.047 --> 07:05.883
Was the president planning
to divorce the former president

07:06.300 --> 07:08.094
in the days leading up to his death?

07:10.721 --> 07:12.807
Uh, let's...

07:13.641 --> 07:15.685
- Oh. Mr. Vice President.
- Morning, everyone.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.396
I hope Miss Stewart won’t mind me
taking a couple of questions.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.559
Mr. Vice President, one question!

07:22.233 --> 07:23.734
Marcus, who's your source?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.779
- Unnamed officials.
- Nope. We don't do that anymore.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.531
We need names. You have a name?

07:29.031 --> 07:31.451
I mean really, where do you get this?

07:31.909 --> 07:32.910
The former president

07:34.120 --> 07:35.413
spent his last night alive

07:35.496 --> 07:37.216
next to his wife in the White House.
Period.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.624
As for Bellport...

07:39.500 --> 07:41.770
let’s not jump to conclusions
before all the facts are in.

07:41.794 --> 07:42.795
What else?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.631
We still going door to door,
but it's really a precaution.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.633
Are there enough beds?

07:47.717 --> 07:51.012
We have a few church basements
and the local jail if we need more.

07:51.095 --> 07:54.182
Whatever hydrogen sulfide there is left
in the air is already dissipating.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.785
In a day or two, people will be back
sleeping in their own beds.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.144
You have to understand,

07:58.394 --> 07:59.854
Madam President,

08:00.062 --> 08:03.232
most everyone overreacts
when it comes to chemicals.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.193
We have years of experience...

08:05.276 --> 08:07.153
And the men who died in the accident?

08:07.236 --> 08:10.573
That's tragic, of course.
They were valued employees.

08:10.656 --> 08:13.701
Members of the community.
There's no way to replace them.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.286
And Bill Shepherd?

08:16.120 --> 08:18.164
- Yes.
- Have you heard from him?

08:19.081 --> 08:22.335
I've kept him informed,
as well as all of our partners.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.838
Bill called me directly.
They're ready to do whatever's needed.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.465
They're important to Bellport.

08:27.548 --> 08:30.235
They built the local stadium.
Even this gymnasium. They contributed...

08:30.259 --> 08:32.303
No, I’m well aware
of the family’s philanthropy.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.679
That wasn't the question.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.725
Yes, Mr. Shepherd has been monitoring
the situation closely.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.434
I would like to tour the area.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.440
Is that a problem, Governor?

08:45.024 --> 08:47.443
No, no, not to my understanding.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.780
I was hoping to get you over to...

08:50.863 --> 08:52.448
to where we set up our triage.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.384
It might be best
if we stick to the itinerary...

08:54.408 --> 08:56.160
I'd actually like to see it for myself.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.037
Unless, of course, you tell me otherwise.

08:58.788 --> 08:59.997
No, of course not.

09:07.755 --> 09:11.634
The guard
marks the doors of the evacuees.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.387
Pretty standard procedure.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.474
Stop the car. I think I see someone.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.227
Stop the car.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.273
Madam President,
we’ll have someone circle back.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.566
Stop the car now.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.118
Damn it.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.704
Is she safe?

09:39.787 --> 09:41.998
Nothing is 100% safe.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.098
Hello. Anyone here?

10:23.914 --> 10:26.560
- The boy could have lost an eye.
- That’s not how we treat people.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.520
- How could she?
- My God, Elizabeth, stop it.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.147
Am I raising a daughter or an animal?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.232
They're the animals,
the way they attacked her.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.759
Oh, of course, take her side. Of course!

10:34.842 --> 10:36.636
It's time she learned about the world.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.306
Pretty girls have a responsibility
to their beauty.

10:41.098 --> 10:43.184
I’ll bet she dared those boys.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.769
Shame on her.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.814
Why can't you just do as you're told?

10:49.982 --> 10:51.275
Why, indeed?

10:51.359 --> 10:54.278
Madam President! Madam President.

10:57.573 --> 10:58.908
Madam President...

11:00.493 --> 11:02.411
might be best if we head back.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.861
So, the house is safe?

11:13.798 --> 11:14.882
Drink it then.

11:22.723 --> 11:23.891
I thought so.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.749
- But what am I agreeing to?
- I can read it for you.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.083
I can read.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.044
And what's this for?

11:53.003 --> 11:55.631
That lets the app figure out
how we can be most helpful.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.552
It can be tailored to your specific needs.
We want to keep you informed.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.304
We want you to know what happens
before it happens.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.640
You can’t trust the government to do that.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.934
- Hello, my name is Seth Grayson.
- Nice to meet you.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.737
I'm with Shepherd Freedom Foundation,
can I talk to you for a second?

12:10.062 --> 12:14.191
Sure thing. I was looking
at the pamphlet saying just...

12:20.072 --> 12:21.198
It's the president.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.184
Madam President.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.062
Whose idea was it? To leave it on his bed?

12:52.938 --> 12:54.106
Not here.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.903
The Shepherd Freedom Foundation
is here to help.

12:59.570 --> 13:03.240
The federal government is here
to help you.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.075
Yes, Madam President.

13:05.367 --> 13:09.288
The only way America’s problems
will be solved is through alliances

13:09.371 --> 13:12.875
between government and private industry,
each doing its part.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.671
The Commander in Chief and I go way back.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.216
We do. And I know I have
the full cooperation

13:20.299 --> 13:21.592
from the Shepherd family.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.930
The blatant disregard for human life
exhibited by companies like Arcas...

13:26.013 --> 13:28.682
Arcas is committed
to the safety of its workers.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.976
And with the help of...

13:31.477 --> 13:34.271
the right kind of legislation,
like the FUTURE Act.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.357
Which is under review at the moment.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.526
Until then,

13:38.609 --> 13:42.404
I am hereby moving
the EPA’s Criminal Investigative Division

13:42.488 --> 13:43.906
<i>into the Pentagon,</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:48.369
<i>where it will enjoy the forces
and the resources of our military.</i>

13:48.869 --> 13:51.205
<i>And they will investigate this disaster.</i>

13:51.914 --> 13:55.751
<i>I swear on my husband's grave,
I will find out what happened here.</i>

13:56.919 --> 13:58.671
<i>Thank you for your support.</i>

14:01.173 --> 14:03.853
I wanted to leave it on your bed.
Don't be thick, thick I can't use.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.810
<i>Did she actually ask for a divorce?</i>

14:12.893 --> 14:15.855
- As if that matters.
- <i>And if I’m asked to justify the question?</i>

14:15.938 --> 14:18.566
It was justified the moment
they didn’t have an answer.

14:19.608 --> 14:22.945
The last thing the president wants is
to be talking about the former president.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.238
<i>Let me ask you this.</i>

14:24.321 --> 14:25.322
How did your mother feel

14:25.406 --> 14:27.658
when the president
yanked her hand away like that?

14:27.741 --> 14:29.952
<i>That's none of your goddamn business,
Marcus.</i>

14:33.789 --> 14:36.101
- Recoil? Is that the word you used?
- Yeah, that's what I see.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.352
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

14:37.376 --> 14:40.504
Are we really gonna waste time
dissecting a gesture between two women?

14:40.588 --> 14:42.715
Nora’s right. I was there.
There wasn't a recoil.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.383
I gotta agree with Tom here. For me,

14:44.466 --> 14:46.677
it's Annette Shepherd
sort of manhandling the president

14:46.760 --> 14:49.471
as a sign of victory,
and then I detect a flinch.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.765
A slight flinch, then recoil.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.101
- Recoil? I mean...
- She’s trying to separate herself

14:54.184 --> 14:57.229
from the primary source of the funding
for what was to be

14:57.313 --> 15:00.357
- the Francis J. Underwood Foundation.
- This is about culpability.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.402
She went to Bellport
to hold those responsible accountable.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.655
Companies like Shepherd Unlimited
have been hamstrung.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.819
And that's why this bill on her desk
is so important.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.827
Legislation means nothing
without proper enforcement.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.288
Weaponizing the EPA is wrongheaded.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.748
And it does nothing to make...

15:15.831 --> 15:18.876
Instead of ascribing negative motives
to her every action,

15:18.959 --> 15:21.086
why can’t we just accept
that President Underwood

15:21.170 --> 15:23.172
was out there being presidential?

15:23.255 --> 15:26.383
She put the fear of God into you
and your new friends, Mr. Grayson.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.761
Being "presidential"
means signing the bill

15:28.844 --> 15:31.013
and modernizing antiquated regulations.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.576
As if you would know.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.433
What's that supposed to mean?

15:34.516 --> 15:36.852
Her husband, whose administration
you were a part of,

15:36.936 --> 15:37.770
was about to...

15:37.853 --> 15:40.397
Was in the midst of setting up
a philanthropic foundation.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.149
Her husband was about to be indicted.

15:42.232 --> 15:45.235
- There wasn’t even a grand jury.
- I have it on good authority

15:45.319 --> 15:48.113
he was about to be indicted,
and she was about to pardon him.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.990
But she also wanted a divorce.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.159
To save herself. Distance herself.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.829
Because, come on. Are you telling me
she knew nothing of what he was up to?

15:55.913 --> 15:58.082
- If he was guilty, she was guilty.
- Tom? Tom,

15:58.165 --> 16:00.845
I have great respect for you
and the work you’ve done at the Herald.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.630
But are you even capable
of defining her on her own terms?

16:04.713 --> 16:07.359
I’m sorry. One minute she’s playing
the grieving widow and the next,

16:07.383 --> 16:09.235
<i>- she's riding on the coattails.
- Case in point.</i>

16:09.259 --> 16:11.339
<i>This may be an unseemly thing to say,</i>

16:11.845 --> 16:13.263
<i>but it’s quite possible</i>

16:13.347 --> 16:16.225
<i>her husband's death
was the president's lucky day.</i>

16:18.560 --> 16:20.396
<i>You can say whatever you want in here.</i>

16:20.479 --> 16:22.272
<i>Whatever your feeling, thinking.</i>

16:22.856 --> 16:24.608
I’m questioning your ability.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.236
My ability?

16:28.362 --> 16:31.865
To tell the difference
between justifiable paranoia and...

16:33.909 --> 16:35.494
Do you use the word anymore?

16:35.577 --> 16:36.577
"Madness?"

16:38.580 --> 16:40.541
What do you feel paranoid about?

16:42.292 --> 16:43.460
Myself, maybe.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.339
Why we do what we do and for who?

16:50.509 --> 16:52.052
Who’s more evil, Doctor,

16:53.178 --> 16:55.431
the taskmaster or the tasked?

16:55.931 --> 17:00.269
Do you feel like Francis Underwood
betrayed you?

17:00.561 --> 17:02.646
I guess I'm wondering who betrayed him.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.439
Who do you think?

17:05.107 --> 17:06.107
You?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.615
I don’t know if these sessions
are helping me anymore.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.079
Why are you trying to drug me up, Doctor?

17:19.163 --> 17:20.789
I think you should consider it.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.873
Clozapine.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.084
You must know what that does to a person.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.170
They're a newer class
of antipsychotics, Doug.

17:26.252 --> 17:30.382
The side effects are not as sensational
as some of the older ones.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.053
You don't have to suffer like this.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.056
From my understanding, the side effects
themselves can make you look...

17:37.765 --> 17:41.268
And again, I’m asking you
if you use this word "mad."

17:45.397 --> 17:46.940
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:47.608 --> 17:48.442
Pardon?

17:48.525 --> 17:51.629
You're gonna talk to me about side effects
while you look at your fucking clock?

17:51.653 --> 17:53.155
No, you’re right. I’m sorry.

17:53.238 --> 17:56.718
We’re gonna have to take this up tomorrow
afternoon. This is a much bigger conversation.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.083
No, I'm talking now.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.795
I'm sorry, but your time is up.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.713
I don’t give a fuck about the time.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.839
Mr. Stamper.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.635
I’m glad that you finally decided
to take advantage of your time here,

18:14.718 --> 18:15.803
but you know the rules.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.680
I'm not going anywhere.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.182
Mr. Stamper, please.

18:20.265 --> 18:23.310
I don’t want to have to call someone,
but I will.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.232
This is bullshit.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.369
Your uncle is not happy.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.665
Are you aware of how many of your
sentences start with you quoting him?

18:44.748 --> 18:45.666
He's right.

18:45.749 --> 18:47.084
This circus backfired.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.169
- I thought you were wonderful.
- Your uncle thinks

18:49.253 --> 18:51.421
- we've made a bad situation worse.
- Mom.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.298
Now I'm the face of this thing.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.676
Which we will use to our advantage.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.803
She called us out by name.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.514
We can spin it any way we want.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.057
Work the Congress.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.518
Even if she vetoes the bill,
they can override it.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.311
She overreacted.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.274
- And it made a fool of me.
- I'm telling you,

19:10.691 --> 19:11.691
you won.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.444
She thinks she did.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.114
I know that expression, trust me.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.076
Phew. She can’t decide
if she’s Lady Macbeth or Macbeth.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.955
- Your uncle takes it from here.
- No.

19:25.289 --> 19:28.125
This isn't personal for me,
not like it is for you and Uncle Bill.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.043
You know he hates the spotlight,

19:30.460 --> 19:31.753
for any of us.

19:32.254 --> 19:36.014
Prefers an old school way of dealing with things. - I...
- And don’t think you know everything.

19:38.343 --> 19:39.678
Because you don't.

19:42.347 --> 19:43.390
Let me talk to Uncle Bill.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.519
He’s taken a suite at the Hay-Adams.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.438
Frank’s old room.

19:52.816 --> 19:54.818
It's Doug Stamper, Madam US Attorney.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.154
<i>- </i><i>How did you get this number?</i>
- Don't hang up.

19:57.237 --> 20:00.407
<i>The next call I expect is
from your lawyer. In my office.</i>

20:00.490 --> 20:01.408
You really shouldn’t.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.576
<i>Mr. Stamper,</i>

20:02.659 --> 20:05.162
<i>- this is highly...</i>
- I’m going to recant.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.292
<i>Are you there?</i>

20:10.667 --> 20:11.667
Yes.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.296
<i>I'm going to lay out
how it's going to go.</i>

20:14.838 --> 20:17.090
<i>And you stop me at any point
if I’m wrong.</i>

20:17.883 --> 20:18.926
<i>But I'm going to recant.</i>

20:20.135 --> 20:22.512
Which means you’re going to need
a new prosecutor.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.890
Because you’re going to have
to recuse yourself

20:24.973 --> 20:26.808
so you can testify against me.

20:27.976 --> 20:29.394
And this call we're on,

20:30.687 --> 20:32.648
is not going to look very good for you.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.860
Anything you say in court
will be ruled hearsay.

20:37.736 --> 20:38.820
And the judge,

20:39.738 --> 20:42.616
if he’s in a good mood,
is going to ask for more evidence,

20:43.367 --> 20:46.119
and you and your new prosecutor
aren't going to have any.

20:47.704 --> 20:50.707
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.880
This case isn't going to make your career.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.926
<i>The case that's going change your life</i>

21:01.009 --> 21:03.220
<i>is the prosecution of Claire Underwood.</i>

21:11.061 --> 21:12.271
It's gruesome,

21:12.562 --> 21:13.647
what's gone on here.

21:14.147 --> 21:16.024
I checked all the log books myself.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.819
I spoke with the executive housekeeper.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.822
She interviewed the staff.
Nobody knows anything.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.365
So his ring just appeared on his bed
by magic?

21:23.991 --> 21:28.287
My feeling is, it’s not the fact of it
that we should be focusing on.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.371
But...

21:29.955 --> 21:31.123
what it means.

21:32.332 --> 21:35.794
Tell me, Mark. What kind of people
dig up a man's grave

21:35.877 --> 21:39.047
and remove a ring from his cold...

21:39.548 --> 21:40.465
hard finger?

21:40.549 --> 21:43.927
The same people that are generating
this drum beat about Francis' pardon

21:44.011 --> 21:45.470
and your divorce.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.806
You are daring them.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.851
You've turned it into a spectacle,
and now they will not stop.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.562
Believe me. These people will not rest.

21:53.645 --> 21:54.896
You need to make amends.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.356
For slighting her?

21:56.898 --> 21:59.693
- For identifying them?
- You have to give them something.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.737
- I don't believe in the bill.
- Oh, goddamn it!

22:01.820 --> 22:03.822
This bill. Are you listening?

22:04.948 --> 22:07.075
Do you want to spend
the rest of your presidency

22:07.159 --> 22:08.744
defending your dead husband,

22:08.827 --> 22:09.995
defending his...

22:10.078 --> 22:11.163
deeds?

22:11.955 --> 22:14.875
Because they will make sure
that every waking and even sleeping moment

22:14.958 --> 22:17.794
of your time in the White House
is about him!

22:30.557 --> 22:33.143
Make amends for the last hundred days.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.395
Then you can have the next four years.

22:36.646 --> 22:39.900
When you present the scholarship
at the Take Aim Club this weekend,

22:39.983 --> 22:41.223
Annette Shepherd will be there.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.779
She's on the board. They're all donors.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.947
Appear with your old friend...

22:47.407 --> 22:49.326
and sign this bill.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.580
You know, I can help you...

22:54.331 --> 22:56.500
with the Shepherds.
I know how to talk to them.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.172
And please, please explain to me
why you thought...

23:02.672 --> 23:04.007
putting that elevated intern

23:04.091 --> 23:05.771
in front of the press yesterday
serves you.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.762
- Because she's honest.
- I had Mitch Glazer lined up.

23:08.845 --> 23:11.139
- He's got 30 years of...
- Because she’s not Mitch.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.683
Because I know you pushed out Sean.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.144
Sean Jeffries had a hard time
telling the truth.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.523
- Your truth?
- Yes, the one that keeps you in power.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.065
And now what?

23:23.068 --> 23:25.946
We’ve traded his ambition for her naïveté?

23:26.029 --> 23:27.114
I believe her.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.741
And so will everyone else.

23:47.926 --> 23:51.680
- Oh, I’m sorry, do you need me to...
- No, no, actually, I was looking for you.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.766
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

23:55.976 --> 23:56.810
No, please.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.187
- I was happy to have your help.
- Okay.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.566
You know Sean's not coming back, right?

24:02.649 --> 24:03.733
I heard.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.862
The president must see something in you.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.655
What do you think that is?

24:11.616 --> 24:13.368
It was an amazing opportunity.

24:14.077 --> 24:17.080
And I've heard there are some
wonderful candidates for the position.

24:18.206 --> 24:19.206
Yeah.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.376
Well, until then...

24:24.129 --> 24:25.547
why don't you to continue on

24:26.047 --> 24:27.174
as acting press secretary.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.552
Of course. Yes, sir.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.387
And thank you and the president.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.267
Do you believe in her, Miss Stewart?

24:37.350 --> 24:38.350
I do.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.229
I ask because...

24:42.647 --> 24:45.358
I want you to know
there are powerful forces out there

24:45.942 --> 24:48.361
that are invested in seeing her fail.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.533
So you're gonna hear rumors.
You're gonna hear innuendos.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.452
You’ll need to stick
to your talking points.

24:56.244 --> 25:00.373
Not get lured off-track with,
what, salacious questions.

25:00.790 --> 25:01.875
I understand.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.420
Right now,
I’m thede facto chief of staff.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.005
So, if you need...

25:07.714 --> 25:09.174
help or advice,

25:10.258 --> 25:11.426
you know where to find me.

25:13.970 --> 25:14.970
Good luck. Thank you.

25:26.066 --> 25:29.319
There’s a fire burning
in the Valley outside of Los Angeles.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.405
So, the Foundation sends volunteers in,
we sign them up for the app.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.283
How many signed up in Bellport?

25:36.284 --> 25:39.579
In and around the area,
close to 50,000 phones.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.250
But beside the fires,
there's flooding in the Panhandle.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.585
It's been raining for days.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.421
There's a pipeline that's burst
in North Dakota.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.590
And my nephew came up with this?

25:50.674 --> 25:53.134
Well, it’s based
on pre-existing technology, but...

25:53.718 --> 25:54.886
he saw the potential.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.639
Essentially they’re handing over
their phones,

25:57.722 --> 26:01.142
which as you know, is basically
an extension of the self at this point.

26:01.226 --> 26:04.187
Duncan calls them
"the sarcophagi of our souls."

26:05.146 --> 26:07.107
We’ll be crawling peoples’ phones.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.610
You get to decide what people see
and when.

26:10.694 --> 26:13.071
Did Frank take this room
because of the view?

26:16.449 --> 26:18.827
Yes, I think he did.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.669
You respected him.

26:29.462 --> 26:30.462
Did you fear him?

26:31.548 --> 26:32.548
Yes.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.218
But you always knew
where you stood with him.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.011
And her?

26:38.013 --> 26:39.180
You never know.

26:44.644 --> 26:46.605
Did the workers at the plant sign up
for the app?

26:47.772 --> 26:49.816
- Most of them did, yes.
- Good.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.067
Good.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.237
I'm glad you’re working with us, Seth.

26:54.863 --> 26:57.657
Your perspective,
when it comes to the Underwoods,

26:57.741 --> 26:58.825
my nephew.

27:01.369 --> 27:02.579
I appreciate it.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.543
Retired agents?

27:09.419 --> 27:10.795
They're freelance now.

27:10.879 --> 27:13.882
Working for Nexis Securities.
A lot of guys do it.

27:14.257 --> 27:16.402
Apparently these two have been
on the ground in Gaffney

27:16.426 --> 27:17.927
for the last week or so.

27:18.011 --> 27:20.555
- Hired by who?
- We don't know yet.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.409
But they're making enough
so that one of them just purchased

27:23.433 --> 27:25.185
a second home on the Chesapeake Bay.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.145
They...

27:28.897 --> 27:31.024
broke into your Gaffney residence, ma’am.

27:32.067 --> 27:34.527
What? Where was Secret Service?

27:34.611 --> 27:35.945
And why wasn’t I alerted?

27:36.571 --> 27:38.031
Because no one was alerted.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.450
They left it completely untouched,

27:40.533 --> 27:41.951
as far as anyone can tell.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.039
How did you know anyone was there, then?

27:46.331 --> 27:50.251
An insomniac neighbor who spotted
the light from a phone screen inside.

27:52.462 --> 27:54.506
Taking pictures, I’m assuming.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.383
My, my, my.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.052
Night life in Gaffney
certainly has picked up.

28:06.351 --> 28:08.269
Started when I was a kid.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.689
Whenever the opportunity
would present itself,

28:10.772 --> 28:14.359
I’d slip my hand into a coat pocket
to see what I could find.

28:15.735 --> 28:18.613
A stranger’s pocket is a window
into his soul.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.783
And what did you find?

28:23.785 --> 28:24.828
Condoms.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.622
Mints. Keys.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.000
Did you steal what you found?

28:31.918 --> 28:34.337
Not the mints.
Because that would be cruel.

28:36.923 --> 28:37.966
Was that you...

28:39.467 --> 28:40.719
on the way to the airport?

28:40.802 --> 28:42.846
Were you trying to teach her a lesson?

28:43.179 --> 28:44.472
- Talk to Bill.
- Come on.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.099
I already did.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.646
- She's late.
- Yeah, she’s the president.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.774
You know, you have a weakness
for strong women.

28:54.858 --> 28:55.858
Oh.

28:55.942 --> 28:56.943
No, really.

28:59.028 --> 29:00.739
You think they need your help.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.121
Really?

29:08.204 --> 29:09.998
- Still?
- No, no.

29:10.707 --> 29:11.916
I chew now.

29:12.834 --> 29:13.835
I just like to...

29:14.627 --> 29:15.670
play with this.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.008
Wait.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.386
She's here.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.828
Madam President, Duncan Shepherd.

29:49.662 --> 29:52.081
- Oh. Hello.
- Claire.

29:53.291 --> 29:54.291
Annette.

29:55.126 --> 29:56.711
I see you've met Duncan.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.464
- Shall we?
- Yes.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.930
Don’t ever recoil from me again.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.611
- Ain’t 50 nifty?
- Mm-hmm.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.240
I think the last time you dragged me
into a bathroom,

30:25.323 --> 30:26.908
it was to show off your hickey.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.623
I don’t think your brother
is gonna let up, Annette.

30:34.415 --> 30:37.252
Until he gets his ring kissed directly,
I think.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.631
Reminds me of someone you were married to.

30:41.714 --> 30:45.468
Oh, no. Bill and Francis
are very different people.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.553
Agreed.

30:49.264 --> 30:51.099
You know I slept with him once.

30:51.975 --> 30:52.975
Your brother?

30:54.143 --> 30:55.228
Your husband.

30:56.938 --> 30:57.938
I know.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.859
Interesting.

31:01.609 --> 31:03.736
Though, come to think of it,
I guess it makes sense.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.280
What does?

31:07.448 --> 31:09.868
That your marriage allowed for that.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.997
Well, it was the '98 campaign.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.000
Francis was facing a robust challenger,

31:17.083 --> 31:20.253
and there you were
at some DC fundraiser or other.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.046
It was at the Union Station,

31:22.130 --> 31:23.131
- East Hall.
- Yes.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.934
And there you were,
dangling your checkbook.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.177
So, it sounds like a favorable transaction
all around.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.180
- Is that what he told you?
- I never asked for details.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.391
I mean, I was curious.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.018
I really was.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.145
He was a good kisser, I’ll say that.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.815
But then the rest
was so underwhelming.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.276
Felt like he wasn’t all there.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.694
Like, he wasn't...

31:45.361 --> 31:46.821
all in, so to speak.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.824
Of course, my first thought, and...

31:50.950 --> 31:52.243
isn’t this true of most women?

31:52.327 --> 31:53.828
Was to wonder if it was me.

31:53.912 --> 31:58.791
Was I somehow less skilled
than I like to believe I am?

32:00.251 --> 32:02.545
Well, I can’t really answer to that,
Annette.

32:03.254 --> 32:04.254
I can.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.007
It was him.

32:08.259 --> 32:09.259
And...

32:10.303 --> 32:12.513
I bet it was never very different
with you.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.391
Even you.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.477
The blonde goddess.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.772
Even with you. Am I right?

32:23.566 --> 32:24.566
Wow.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.112
It's really only dawning on me now.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.740
The sacrifice you made.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.785
I sort of pity you.

32:33.868 --> 32:37.372
What you must have denied yourself
all those years.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.375
And this is where I tell you
to shut your mouth, Annette.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.503
You don't know anything about marriage,

32:44.003 --> 32:45.129
much less mine.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.716
Tell yourself whatever you want, Claire.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.052
We both know the truth.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.472
He’s waiting for you down the hall
in the prep kitchen.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.351
My brother.

32:59.519 --> 33:02.021
I can still do it by the way.

33:04.065 --> 33:05.065
Can you?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.277
Well, you missed dinner.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.207
I can have 'em make you
whatever you like.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.375
I'm not hungry.

34:05.334 --> 34:06.753
The secret here is how much

34:07.128 --> 34:08.713
lemon juice you put in.

34:09.338 --> 34:10.840
Balance out the butter.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.885
People and hollandaise.

34:13.967 --> 34:15.678
They think it tastes like money.

34:16.512 --> 34:19.139
- A night at the hotel.
- What where you looking for?

34:19.389 --> 34:22.310
There’s nothing in the Gaffney home
of value.

34:24.687 --> 34:25.980
Frank did things.

34:26.438 --> 34:27.607
And you just, what?

34:28.357 --> 34:29.442
Look the other way?

34:29.525 --> 34:32.904
That shot you took at me,
it’s not like you to be so reckless.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.281
You don’t scare easy.

34:36.657 --> 34:41.120
The future of our country is at stake.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.331
Does that sound...

34:44.040 --> 34:45.750
pat to you, naive?

34:46.833 --> 34:48.085
No, not at all.

34:49.003 --> 34:51.464
Do you think I don't have friends
at the Pentagon, Claire?

34:51.547 --> 34:54.884
You may want to make my four years
in office miserable...

34:54.967 --> 34:57.595
All I want you to do is behave,
as promised.

34:57.678 --> 35:01.099
You can dig up a ring or whatever else
you can get your hands on.

35:01.182 --> 35:05.019
But that doesn't mean I won't make
your time a living hell as well.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.567
Raymond Tusk said about you one time,

35:11.651 --> 35:13.319
some dinner we were at,
he just said it...

35:13.402 --> 35:15.506
This is where I'm supposed
to be a little bit afraid of the answer,

35:15.530 --> 35:16.965
- I suppose.
- He said, "I don't know,

35:16.989 --> 35:18.699
whether or not she's a person...

35:20.535 --> 35:22.328
or just playing the part of one."

35:22.411 --> 35:26.165
And I thought it was so strange
at the time, but maybe it's true.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.083
Just...

35:30.545 --> 35:31.545
unreachable.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.509
I know it'll be hard for you.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.304
But you're going to have to treat me
as an equal, Bill.

35:44.267 --> 35:46.018
What did you do with your husband's will?

35:46.853 --> 35:48.771
It was a revocable trust.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.272
All done.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.066
I'm not talking about that one.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.694
I'm talking about the other one.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.362
The new one.

35:57.488 --> 36:01.284
Bet Doug Stamper would love
to see the contents of that one.

36:02.618 --> 36:03.911
What's in there anyway?

36:04.620 --> 36:07.707
That you would go to such lengths

36:08.457 --> 36:09.876
to keep him from it?

36:13.629 --> 36:15.214
Claire Hale has a secret.

36:19.677 --> 36:23.556
Douglas Stamper is meeting
with the US District Attorney

36:23.639 --> 36:24.974
as we speak.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.351
He's out, Claire.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.313
And he's not going back in.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.317
Now, you need my help.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.652
Later tonight,

36:37.862 --> 36:40.781
I'm going to watch you sign that bill

36:41.157 --> 36:43.159
that's sitting on your desk.

36:44.619 --> 36:45.828
"To the dead,

36:46.162 --> 36:48.289
a kingdom means nothing.

36:49.332 --> 36:52.376
They have their requiem and eternity."

36:53.044 --> 36:55.546
That's <i>Macbeth. </i> The opera, not the play.

36:56.631 --> 36:59.175
All you have to do now
is just go on out there

36:59.508 --> 37:01.510
with your oldest, dearest friend and...

37:03.012 --> 37:04.931
hold her hand up high.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.489
Madam President.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.242
You don’t really think
the military is irrelevant?

37:24.825 --> 37:29.497
I watched your confirmation
from my chambers for the UN.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.959
- Wasn't my finest hour.
- Well, he who laughs loudest...

37:33.042 --> 37:34.835
Or is it "laughs last"?

37:34.919 --> 37:36.587
"Last." "She."

37:37.171 --> 37:39.507
- Vincent Abruzzo.
- Ninth Circuit.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.842
I am no good at functions like this.

37:41.926 --> 37:47.014
I tend to find a chair at these things
and sit in it for the rest of the evening.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.558
- Madam President.
- Yes. Well, it's been a pleasure.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.811
Madam President, if I may say,

37:51.894 --> 37:55.481
I'm so glad that we finally have a woman
in the Oval Office.

37:55.564 --> 37:58.150
The arc of history is long, but...

37:58.609 --> 38:01.279
The reign of the middle-aged white man
is over.

38:01.904 --> 38:05.283
The Bill Shepherds of the world
who won’t let go, have to go.

38:12.748 --> 38:16.168
Does anyone except you know about
the document that came for him?

38:16.460 --> 38:17.837
<i>No, of course not.</i>

38:18.921 --> 38:21.215
Because if anyone else
gets their hand on that will...

38:21.299 --> 38:23.092
<i>That is strictly between us.</i>

38:23.175 --> 38:25.011
We only just discovered
that he was missing.

38:25.636 --> 38:28.222
I put a call into the US Attorney
and was just informed

38:28.306 --> 38:29.765
charges have been dropped.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.018
How is that even possible?

38:32.101 --> 38:34.645
<i>I thought I’d lost my phone
a couple of days ago, but...</i>

38:35.313 --> 38:38.607
<i>But now I'm certain that he took it
and reached out to make a deal.</i>

38:39.525 --> 38:41.527
I can have a grand jury impaneled

38:41.610 --> 38:44.780
and we can be taking testimony
from witnesses within a week.

38:46.657 --> 38:47.700
Who do you have?

38:48.451 --> 38:49.827
Secretary Durant?

38:51.787 --> 38:52.788
And others.

38:55.041 --> 38:58.419
I'm sure I don't need to talk to you
about what's right or wrong.

38:58.878 --> 39:01.505
But in my experience,
most people, in the end,

39:01.589 --> 39:03.758
will do whatever they need to,
to save themselves.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.560
Do you think you have
a strong enough case?

39:15.353 --> 39:16.729
That depends on you.

39:17.396 --> 39:20.775
If I'm gonna put myself on the line,
I need to know you're going to win.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.777
This can be a very unforgiving town.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.570
I'm giving you a chance to start over.

39:26.947 --> 39:28.991
- Come on.
- I can offer you immunity

39:29.075 --> 39:30.242
for your testimony.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.455
But, Mr. Stamper, of course,
I can't give you any guarantees

39:34.538 --> 39:37.792
when it comes to your reputation
or that of the former president.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.961
You would have to testify
in an open court.

39:41.712 --> 39:42.713
That is the deal.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.554
I should consult with my lawyers.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.643
Thank you for your time, Mr. Stamper.

40:06.362 --> 40:09.073
<i>Join us in supporting
the Dallas Scholarship Fund</i>

40:09.156 --> 40:10.366
<i>for Young Women:</i>

40:10.449 --> 40:11.534
<i>Take aim.</i>

40:26.257 --> 40:28.926
Look at these marvelous faces.

40:29.009 --> 40:31.053
The faces of our future.

40:31.720 --> 40:34.932
And I am so, so honored

40:35.015 --> 40:37.852
to be chosen to introduce to you

40:37.935 --> 40:41.355
the President of the United States,
Claire Underwood.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.342
I look at these brilliant young women

41:10.426 --> 41:12.094
and words fail me.

41:14.930 --> 41:16.182
What's this?

41:16.265 --> 41:18.392
They gave us these.
What are they gonna do?

41:18.976 --> 41:20.686
Yeah, I'm not drinking the water,

41:20.769 --> 41:22.188
no fucking way, I'll tell you that.

41:22.771 --> 41:24.899
I'll go all the way to Canton to buy it,
if I have to.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.693
And... Mr. Grayson,

41:28.486 --> 41:30.821
what else did he tell you about the app?

41:30.905 --> 41:33.699
Nothing.
You can go online and check it out.

41:34.241 --> 41:37.578
'Cause a lot of people I know signed up
for it even after the president left.

41:37.661 --> 41:38.661
Hmm.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.041
He said...

41:45.002 --> 41:46.002
Mr. Grayson?

41:48.047 --> 41:49.298
Yeah, him.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.510
That they were gonna tell us
what was gonna happen

41:52.593 --> 41:54.220
- before it happens.
- How?

41:56.222 --> 41:58.140
Look, I don't know.

41:59.099 --> 42:01.560
Ithaca's, like, where?

42:02.686 --> 42:04.230
There’s one in Greece.

42:04.438 --> 42:06.315
And the other's in upstate New York.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.776
Guess which one I'm from.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.242
It’s a paper, it comes out once a week.

42:24.124 --> 42:25.251
It was going to happen,

42:26.085 --> 42:27.336
because it happened before.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.422
We complained all the way
to the EPA, but...

42:31.048 --> 42:32.048
whatever.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.969
Only this time the explosion was bad.

42:35.052 --> 42:38.764
And yeah, some guys died.
And the company knew.

42:40.975 --> 42:41.975
They knew.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.614
Welcome home.

43:06.959 --> 43:09.295
Good timing. I just put on coffee.

43:10.462 --> 43:11.589
A little late for coffee.

43:11.672 --> 43:13.757
Well, we have so much to talk about.

43:15.759 --> 43:17.261
I'm glad you're out, Doug.

43:17.344 --> 43:19.305
I don't know what you were doing in there.

43:21.348 --> 43:22.891
How's the US Attorney?

43:27.146 --> 43:29.565
Secretary Durant's
negotiating her appearance.

43:32.151 --> 43:33.360
And if...

43:33.819 --> 43:36.363
Cathy should somehow be dissuaded?

43:36.697 --> 43:39.033
- Silenced?
- Then it all goes away.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.411
Yes, but they'll still want to know

43:43.037 --> 43:44.830
who knew what, when.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.626
I feel pretty clear.

43:51.378 --> 43:53.339
You think it was me
who asked you to take the fall

43:53.422 --> 43:56.508
- just because I said the words, right?
- He told me it was you.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.927
- He whispered it in my ear.
- And you believed him.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.346
Like you always believed him.

44:01.930 --> 44:05.100
Well, here’s what I believe.
Zoe Barnes killed herself...

44:05.184 --> 44:07.394
And I expected to be pardoned
for the rest.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.980
Since his death, my hands have been tied.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.817
But I believe the universe
has given us a gift.

44:15.861 --> 44:17.363
I don't know what that means.

44:18.405 --> 44:19.406
Well...

44:21.116 --> 44:23.356
We both lost someone who shaped
the course of our lives.

44:26.413 --> 44:28.832
For good, but also for ill.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.543
And now here we are

44:32.586 --> 44:34.213
unexpectedly free.

44:36.131 --> 44:37.549
To take a different tack.

44:41.845 --> 44:43.931
We can do whatever we want, Doug.

44:45.974 --> 44:47.893
And we’ve been entwined, you and I,

44:48.435 --> 44:49.436
like it or not,

44:50.145 --> 44:51.438
for decades now.

44:51.939 --> 44:53.023
But I think...

44:54.233 --> 44:56.193
we deserve to go our separate ways.

44:57.778 --> 45:01.865
The only problem is we have something
urgent to attend to called Cathy Durant.

45:03.951 --> 45:06.078
And then we can finally be free.

45:08.455 --> 45:09.998
Do what we really want.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.251
Do what we need to do.

45:15.879 --> 45:17.756
What does Doug Stamper want?

45:18.716 --> 45:20.592
Are you trying to erase him?

45:22.428 --> 45:23.762
Because you can't.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.181
I’m not trying to do anything

45:26.265 --> 45:28.892
except be the sitting President
of the United States.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.730
It's wrong to assume

45:33.647 --> 45:36.650
Francis’s ambitions directly aligned
with mine, Doug.

45:38.152 --> 45:42.030
The best way to not to be associated
with his questionable deeds

45:42.114 --> 45:43.994
is to do good.
That’s what I plan to do, anyway.

45:50.664 --> 45:52.332
Oh, you find that funny, do you?

45:53.125 --> 45:54.293
Well, it's true.

45:59.882 --> 46:02.134
I never understood what he saw in you.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.720
I mean the outside, sure.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.306
But the inside...

46:08.891 --> 46:10.726
- LeAnn’s death.
- No.

46:12.144 --> 46:13.395
You never cared for her.

46:13.479 --> 46:14.980
It wasn't necessary.

46:15.981 --> 46:17.274
And I told him so.

46:18.233 --> 46:19.318
And yet...

46:26.950 --> 46:28.494
Doug, do me a favor.

46:33.624 --> 46:34.792
Close your eyes.

46:36.752 --> 46:37.753
Please.

46:50.057 --> 46:51.642
He wanted you to have them.

47:37.020 --> 47:39.815
For this to happen
at this point in your life,

47:39.898 --> 47:41.817
the prognosis is not good.

47:43.819 --> 47:44.903
I know.

47:56.623 --> 47:58.458
Somebody killed Francis,

47:58.542 --> 48:00.335
and yet they don't want him to die.

48:01.086 --> 48:03.881
That last night, the last time we spoke,

48:03.964 --> 48:06.675
was when I declined his phone call
in the Oval Office.

48:07.718 --> 48:11.305
It had been close to two months,
and he was tired of waiting.

48:11.805 --> 48:14.391
So he showed up here in the White House.

48:14.766 --> 48:16.059
Like a thief.

48:16.685 --> 48:18.061
It was terrifying.

48:19.021 --> 48:21.064
He was furious, slurring his words.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.567
"Why can't you do as you're told, Claire?"

48:25.193 --> 48:27.946
I told the world that he died in our bed,

48:28.447 --> 48:29.907
but that's not the truth.

48:30.198 --> 48:32.326
I locked myself in my room that night,

48:32.409 --> 48:34.912
woke up in the morning
and found him dead in his.

48:37.497 --> 48:39.333
They killed him to shut me up.

48:41.335 --> 48:44.546
I need to bury Francis, once and for all.

49:05.025 --> 49:07.319
Do you need help signing it?

49:16.203 --> 49:18.413
No. Bill. Shepherd, enough.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.668
I actually have one condition.

49:26.171 --> 49:27.171
Put it back.
