00:00.066 --> 00:03.002
<i> ¶ we're not gonna take it</i>
adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> mtv did this crazy thing...</i>

00:03.004 --> 00:05.371
<i> ¶ no, we ain't gonna take it</i>
<i> ...And actually played</i>
<i> music videos.</i>

00:05.373 --> 00:08.607
<i> ¶ we're not gonna take it</i>
<i> they taught us that huge hair</i>
<i> and a sick guitar solo...</i>

00:08.609 --> 00:13.078
<i> ¶ anymore</i>
<i> ...Could turn a mere mortal</i>
<i> into a rock god.</i>

00:13.279 --> 00:16.648
<i> ¶ we've got the right</i>
<i> to choose and</i>

00:16.650 --> 00:17.983
<i> ¶ there ain't no way</i>
<i> we'll lose it</i>

00:17.985 --> 00:21.620
<i> So, like all kids,</i>
<i> I formed an epic garage band</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:23.088
<i> With my brother, barry.</i>

00:23.090 --> 00:24.089
<i> ¶ ...This is our song</i>

00:24.091 --> 00:26.158
<i> And we were the stuff</i>
<i> of legends.</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:29.228
(off-key)
<i> ¶ we're not gonna take it</i>

00:29.230 --> 00:30.295
<i> Well, in our minds.</i>

00:30.297 --> 00:35.367
<i> ¶ no, we're not gonna</i>
<i> take it anymore</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:36.368
Thank you, philadelphia.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.470
Good night!
(feedback squeals)

00:38.472 --> 00:40.806
<i> Okay, so we weren't</i>
<i> twisted sister,</i>

00:40.808 --> 00:42.207
<i> But we thought we were.</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:45.511
We're, like, guaranteed
to be superstars.

00:45.513 --> 00:49.281
I mean, I'm big tasty,
the rapper who can
rock a mike.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.416
But I can also rock
a guitar.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.285
You know, if we're gonna be
selling out mega-stadiums,

00:53.287 --> 00:55.254
Maybe we should learn
more than one song.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.923
It's not
about the music, okay?

00:57.925 --> 00:59.758
It's about
the showmanship

00:59.760 --> 01:02.461
And pageantry
and smoke machines

01:02.463 --> 01:06.532
And glitter cannons
and giant hair
and codpieces.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.232
Seems a bit much.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.700
Well, the front man
gets all the ladies.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.136
So I make all the decisions
for barry and the hendersons.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.740
I told you, our band name
isn't gonna have
"barry" in it.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.175
Let's just put it
on the board,

01:16.177 --> 01:18.077
See what it looks like...
Maybe we'll fall in love.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.511
<i> Sure, we had</i>
<i> our creative differences.</i>

01:19.513 --> 01:21.280
<i> ¶ we're not gonna take it</i>
<i> but the one thing</i>
<i> we could agree on</i>

01:21.282 --> 01:25.584
<i> Was that we were</i>
<i> the greatest band</i>
<i> that ever existed.</i>

01:25.586 --> 01:26.452
<i> Just ask our groupies.</i>

01:26.454 --> 01:32.124
(off-key)
<i> ¶ we're not gonna</i>
<i> take it anymore</i>

01:34.761 --> 01:37.062
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

01:37.397 --> 01:38.430
(laughs)

01:38.432 --> 01:41.733
Thank you,
veterans stadium!
Good night!

01:41.735 --> 01:42.601
Wow.
(gasps)

01:42.603 --> 01:44.937
Sounds like
nobody's gonna take it.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.172
Mission accomplished! Yes!

01:47.174 --> 01:48.240
Oh,
you're so awesome!

01:48.242 --> 01:51.877
You remind me of my other
favorite band... Kiss.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.346
No, no, no, no!
Stop, stop!

01:54.348 --> 01:55.314
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:55.316 --> 01:59.818
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:01.621 --> 02:02.554
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:02.556 --> 02:05.557
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:05.559 --> 02:08.227
Adult adam:
<i> It was mid-summer,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:08.229 --> 02:10.429
<i> And america had</i>
<i> its latest obsession...</i>

02:10.431 --> 02:11.230
<i> The royal wedding.</i>

02:11.232 --> 02:14.600
<i> And no one was more into</i>
<i> prince chuck and lady di</i>
<i> than my mom.</i>

02:14.602 --> 02:15.834
Mmm!
That prince charles.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.002
Imagine what it's like
to be married

02:17.004 --> 02:19.004
To someone so regal
and majestic.

02:19.006 --> 02:22.207
Hey, bevy, what kind
of mustard do I like?

02:22.209 --> 02:23.041
You like ketchup.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.744
We have company.
Put on pants or leave.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.979
Yeah.
You win this round.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.882
Guess we can't all have
prince charles, huh?
Oh, hush.

02:29.884 --> 02:31.783
He may not be the biggest
fan of slacks,

02:31.785 --> 02:34.853
But murray can
be very romantic.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.288
Trust me. (chuckles)

02:36.290 --> 02:38.157
Charles and diana got nothing
on our wedding.

02:38.159 --> 02:41.927
Wow. I want to see pictures,
wedding pictures, right now.

02:41.929 --> 02:42.761
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.429
They're all packed away
in the attic.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.199
Here's the album.
Thank you, janice.

02:47.201 --> 02:47.966
Thank you
for chiming in.

02:47.968 --> 02:53.038
Huh. Now, tell me why
murray is sitting down
during your vows.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.006
He got woozy.

02:54.008 --> 02:55.274
Big day,
low blood sugar.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.441
He ate a plum.
It was fine.

02:56.443 --> 02:59.278
Listen, we all have things
about our wedding

02:59.280 --> 03:00.712
That we'd like
to redo, right?

03:00.714 --> 03:01.980
That's why
the hubby and I decided

03:01.982 --> 03:03.048
To renew our vows
last year.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.984
You what, now?
Just an intimate
ceremony.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.453
You know,
some friends and family

03:08.455 --> 03:09.521
And a band, some cake.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.024
You can have
a second wedding?

03:12.158 --> 03:13.525
No!
Come on.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.927
It'll just be
a little ceremony.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.763
Marriage is not like
a magazine subscription.

03:17.765 --> 03:18.997
You don't have to keep
renewing it.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.732
Well, you do if you want
to keep the magazine.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.402
Well...
This magazine right here,

03:23.404 --> 03:26.805
You get for free
for the rest of your life.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.106
How do you like that?

03:28.108 --> 03:29.141
You don't want
to do this? Fine.

03:29.143 --> 03:31.009
How'd you make tears
so fast?

03:31.011 --> 03:31.910
They're always there,

03:31.912 --> 03:35.747
Lying in wait,
because I feel so deeply.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.584
Fine!
You wore me down.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.053
He said yes!

03:41.454 --> 03:42.020
He said yes!

03:42.022 --> 03:44.923
Adult adam: <i> While my mother</i>
<i> couldn't wait to</i>
<i> renew her vows,</i>

03:44.925 --> 03:46.992
<i> My sister was doing</i>
<i> some waiting of her own.</i>

03:46.994 --> 03:50.529
(groans)
just stop talking and
play the bangles already.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.097
I know!
It's music television!

03:52.099 --> 03:53.665
They should
just play videos
and nothing else.

03:53.667 --> 03:58.136
<i> Back then, you couldn't just</i>
<i> pull up your favorite song</i>
<i> with a click on youtube.</i>

03:58.138 --> 04:00.205
<i> You actually had to sit...</i>
Play the video!

04:00.207 --> 04:03.609
<i> ...And wait and wait</i>
<i> until that one glorious moment</i>

04:03.611 --> 04:06.044
<i> When your favorite video</i>
<i> finally came on.</i>
(both squealing)

04:06.046 --> 04:10.382
<i> And nothing would stop you</i>
<i> from singing along.</i>

04:10.516 --> 04:12.117
<i> ¶ close your eyes</i>

04:12.119 --> 04:15.420
<i> ¶ give me your hand,</i>
<i> darl... ¶</i>

04:15.422 --> 04:16.355
(tv zaps)

04:16.357 --> 04:18.156
No!
No!

04:18.158 --> 04:20.692
I will kill you!
I am not kidding.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.295
I will go to jail.
I will do my time.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.164
I may come out
a different person,
but it'll be worth it!

04:26.166 --> 04:28.600
Forget the lame-ass
chick music.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.769
I'm cordially inviting you
out to the garage

04:30.771 --> 04:32.471
To hear a real band.

04:33.039 --> 04:34.706
This...

04:36.075 --> 04:37.809
This is for you, girl.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.845
I...Pick...You.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.780
Adult adam: <i> Yep, barry had</i>
<i> become obsessed</i>

04:41.782 --> 04:43.148
<i> With erica's best friend,</i>
<i> lainey,</i>

04:43.150 --> 04:47.452
<i> Ever since she kissed him</i>
<i> in a moment of</i>
<i> incredibly poor judgment.</i>

04:47.454 --> 04:49.721
I'll dedicate a jam
to you, girl.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.223
Just come
to one of our gigs.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.457
In the garage? No.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.925
Are we done with
this horrible interaction?

04:53.927 --> 04:55.494
Because there's
a tv upstairs. Let's go!

04:55.496 --> 04:58.797
<i> Too bad lainey didn't feel</i>
<i> the same way.</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:00.065
Ah, she's good.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.266
Acting all,
"I don't like you."

05:01.268 --> 05:03.135
I think that's 'cause
she doesn't like you.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.805
Aw, sweet,
naive baby child.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.540
She's just playing
hard to get.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.409
It's obvious
I'm all she thinks about.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.577
It's not that obvious.
(chuckles)

05:12.579 --> 05:14.613
It's all a part of
the game of love,
my brother.

05:14.615 --> 05:18.050
And once we're
topping the charts,
she'll change her tune.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.085
Man! I can't wait
to be famous.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.853
All the kids at school
who call me a nerd

05:21.855 --> 05:23.555
Are gonna beg
to be my best friend.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.824
And I'll buy a ferrari
for every day of the week.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.093
And I will have every
garbage pail kid ever made.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.828
And chuck norris will be
my personal trainer

05:29.830 --> 05:31.229
Till his wife falls in love
with me and it gets awkward.

05:31.231 --> 05:33.999
And I'll buy
bubbles the chimp
from michael jackson

05:34.001 --> 05:35.567
And give him a new name
with dignity,

05:35.569 --> 05:37.135
Like william
or professor bananas.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.404
And charles barkley
will beg me
to join the sixers.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.539
And we'll live
in a mansion in miami,

05:40.541 --> 05:43.709
And gloria estefan
and the miami sound machine
will be our neighbors.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.610
And we're gonna paint
the name of the band
on the roof

05:45.612 --> 05:47.846
So everyone can see it
from the sky!

05:47.848 --> 05:48.980
We'll be rock gods.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.615
There's only one way
to get there.

05:50.617 --> 05:51.583
We got to get ourselves
a gig.

05:51.585 --> 05:55.120
<i> So we did what any band does</i>
<i> when they need a big break.</i>

05:55.122 --> 05:57.723
<i> We asked our mommy.</i>

06:00.326 --> 06:02.861
(feedback squeals)

06:03.196 --> 06:05.197
Yeah.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.766
That's gonna be
a polite pass.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.234
What?
What?

06:09.236 --> 06:10.102
You never say no to us!

06:10.104 --> 06:12.337
Yeah! We're your
delicious snuggle monsters.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.706
I don't think
she understands.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.342
<i> Give us</i>
<i> the thing we want!</i>

06:17.344 --> 06:18.977
Love to.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.278
But can't.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.414
(inhales sharply)

06:23.082 --> 06:25.817
Joke!
She's kidding.

06:25.819 --> 06:26.585
You're hired.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.121
Yes!
I knew we were amazing.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.957
We charge 200 bucks,
non-negotiable.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.093
Dad, I thought we agreed
on dueling harpists.

06:35.095 --> 06:38.463
We'll have them
play one song
at the very end.

06:38.465 --> 06:43.201
The noise will sober
everybody up
for the drive home.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.436
It's money well spent.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.838
I told you you didn't
have to pay for all this.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.841
Stop. What does
my princess want?

06:49.843 --> 06:53.545
Well, I do have
a few ideas. (chuckles)

06:54.180 --> 06:58.483
I'm thinking ice sculptures
and a horse-drawn carriage

06:58.485 --> 07:00.852
And, um, oh,
those carving stations

07:00.854 --> 07:01.920
Where they have
the different meats

07:01.922 --> 07:05.157
And then
you point at the meats,
and they give you the meats.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.992
You want meats,
you got meats.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.261
(chuckles)
"wedding binder"?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.963
Isn't this what you have
when the wedding is real?

07:11.965 --> 07:13.632
Just shut up
and let me do this.

07:13.634 --> 07:17.202
All you have to do
is write your vows. Go.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.303
How about, instead,

07:18.305 --> 07:19.738
I go up
and clean out the gutters

07:19.740 --> 07:21.606
Like you've been
nagging me to do?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.241
There's your romance.

07:23.243 --> 07:23.875
Write your vows.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.813
Adult adam: <i> For my dad,</i>
<i> that was his definition</i>
<i> of no fun.</i>

07:27.815 --> 07:30.282
This is gonna be
so much fun!

07:30.284 --> 07:33.051
Okay. Barry told us
about the $200.

07:33.053 --> 07:33.752
Let's do this.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.153
Whoa, whoa.
What's happening?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.022
Good news.
The girls are
joining the band.

07:37.024 --> 07:41.059
<i> Barry ignored</i>
<i> the cardinal rule</i>
<i> of being in a band.</i>

07:41.061 --> 07:41.893
Lainey.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.295
<i> He let a girl</i>
<i> come between us.</i>

07:43.297 --> 07:46.298
You could share my mike.
It's great for duets.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.766
Your breath
smells like cat food.

07:47.768 --> 07:50.969
I can assure you,
it's people food.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.205
What...
We're a two-man band.

07:53.207 --> 07:56.007
I'm not splitting
our appearance fee
with them.

07:56.009 --> 07:56.541
Think about it.

07:56.543 --> 07:59.845
What's better
than performing for her?

07:59.847 --> 08:00.979
Performing with her.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.180
Now we'll make
sweet music together,

08:02.182 --> 08:04.616
And she won't be able
to deny her feelings
for me.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.851
But it's supposed to be
you and me!

08:05.853 --> 08:08.887
It is just you and me...
And them.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.188
You know
what would be so cool?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.724
If we did
an all-acoustic set.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.124
Totally!

08:13.126 --> 08:15.760
That is a great idea,
lainey!
Adam, take five.

08:15.762 --> 08:16.661
Let's brainstorm.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.029
Do you have any band names,
lainey?

08:18.031 --> 08:19.664
Ooh.
How about the gal pals?

08:19.666 --> 08:20.465
Nailed it!
Never!

08:20.467 --> 08:21.967
Adult adam: <i> As my band</i>
<i> was writing me off,</i>

08:21.969 --> 08:24.669
<i> My dad was busy</i>
<i> writing his vows.</i>

08:24.671 --> 08:29.007
<i> ¶ I bet we've been together</i>
<i> for a million years</i>

08:29.009 --> 08:31.476
<i> ¶ and I'll bet</i>
<i> we'll be together...</i>
<i> Okay, so, he wasn't writing.</i>

08:31.478 --> 08:34.946
<i> He was watching his favorite</i>
<i> tv show,</i> family ties.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.750
<i> ¶ what would we do, baby,</i>
<i> without us?</i>

08:38.752 --> 08:40.085
Adult adam:
<i> Like all shows at the time,</i>

08:40.087 --> 08:43.088
<i> It was only as good</i>
<i> as its opening theme song.</i>

08:43.090 --> 08:45.390
<i> ¶ sha-la-la-la ¶</i>
beverly: Murray!

08:45.392 --> 08:46.157
(tv shuts off)

08:46.159 --> 08:48.326
(remote clatters)
(footsteps approaching)

08:48.328 --> 08:49.694
Are you watching tv?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.096
No, no, no, no, no.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.764
I'm just sitting
in my writing chair,

08:52.766 --> 08:55.433
Letting the ideas flow
from my pen.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.469
You're gonna love
what I got.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.169
It's blank.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.205
Yeah, I got it all
up here, baby.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.275
I know exactly
what I want to say.

09:03.277 --> 09:05.443
Let's hear it.
Right now.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.279
Right now?

09:07.281 --> 09:09.080
You want to pre-hear

09:09.082 --> 09:12.284
The special vows
I wrote special?

09:12.286 --> 09:14.119
Who does that?
Me. Go.

09:14.121 --> 09:16.488
Adult adam:
<i> My dad knew he just had</i>
<i> to speak from the heart</i>

09:16.490 --> 09:20.659
<i> Or the next best thing...</i>
<i> Quote an epic theme song.</i>

09:20.661 --> 09:25.230
"I bet we've been together
for a million years.

09:25.232 --> 09:31.036
"and I bet we'll be together
for a million more.

09:31.203 --> 09:36.007
"it's like I started breathing
on the night we kissed."

09:36.009 --> 09:37.409
<i> My dad couldn't remember</i>
<i> our birthdays,</i>

09:37.411 --> 09:41.079
<i> But he remembered every damn</i>
<i> word of that theme song.</i>

09:41.081 --> 09:44.249
(chuckling)
"what would we do, baby...

09:44.251 --> 09:46.217
"without us?

09:47.019 --> 09:48.820
"sha-la-la-la."

09:48.822 --> 09:51.289
That...Was...

09:51.291 --> 09:52.791
Amazing!

09:52.793 --> 09:54.092
(both laugh)

09:54.094 --> 09:55.060
You love me so much!

09:55.062 --> 09:56.795
I really do.
Oh!

09:56.797 --> 09:58.863
(smooches)
I really do.

09:58.865 --> 09:59.531
"sha-la-la-la."

09:59.533 --> 10:03.568
Oh, I cannot wait
for you to say that
in front of our friends!

10:03.570 --> 10:06.204
Well, you know
I was just spitballing.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.672
I'm gonna
have to rewrite it.

10:07.674 --> 10:08.974
No!
No, no, no, no, no.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.743
You say those words
exactly. (laughs)

10:13.512 --> 10:16.848
I said no more
than 10% baby's breath,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.350
And I'm looking at 30%.

10:18.352 --> 10:19.050
Take it all back.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.621
Wow, bev, you are really
pulling out all the stops.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.190
Ohh. Well, I'm not
the only one.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.293
I mean, I knew
murray was romantic.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.094
He doesn't show it,

10:29.096 --> 10:32.297
But when you press him,
it comes oozing out.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.165
Oh, you should hear
the vows he's writing for me.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.668
What did he say?
I got to hear.
I got to hear.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.435
It was a private moment.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.304
I... I don't really remember
what was said...

10:39.306 --> 10:43.074
Oh, fair enough.
...But it was
definitely this.

10:43.175 --> 10:48.513
"I bet we've been together
for a million years.

10:48.714 --> 10:53.718
"and I bet we'll be together
for a million more.

10:53.720 --> 10:58.390
"it's like I started breathing
on the night we kissed."

10:58.392 --> 10:59.891
Hmm.
What?

10:59.893 --> 11:03.194
It's just that...
Have you seen <i> family ties?</i>

11:03.196 --> 11:04.262
It's a hit tv show.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.798
Insanely popular.
Michael j. Fox?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.033
Where are you going
with this?

11:08.035 --> 11:10.869
I think
that murray's vows

11:10.871 --> 11:14.305
May share
a few similarities with...

11:14.307 --> 11:16.041
A very famous
theme song.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.843
What? No.
You are so way off.

11:18.845 --> 11:24.616
You're right.
But did his vows happen
to end with "sha-la-la-la"?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.588
You should go.
I should go.

11:30.823 --> 11:32.524
(girls singing in distance)
adult adam:
<i> Even though my brother</i>

11:32.526 --> 11:35.393
<i> Let lainey yoko ono her way</i>
<i> into our band,</i>

11:35.395 --> 11:38.463
<i> I was still clinging</i>
<i> to our original dream.</i>

11:38.465 --> 11:40.865
<i> That is, until I heard this.</i>

11:40.867 --> 11:43.101
<i> ¶ do you feel the same?</i>

11:43.103 --> 11:46.805
<i> ¶ am I only dreaming</i>

11:46.807 --> 11:53.878
<i> ¶ or is this burning</i>
<i> an eternal flame?</i>

11:53.880 --> 11:56.314
(off-key)
<i> ¶ say my name</i>

11:56.316 --> 11:58.883
<i> ¶ sun shines</i>
<i> through the rain</i>

11:58.885 --> 12:01.686
<i> ¶ a whole life</i>
<i> so lonely</i>

12:01.688 --> 12:05.523
<i> ¶ then you come</i>
<i> and ease the pain ¶</i>

12:05.525 --> 12:07.525
Stop! Stop!

12:07.593 --> 12:09.060
What have you done?

12:09.062 --> 12:10.328
Where's my drum set?

12:10.330 --> 12:11.229
There are no drums, bro.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.164
Here. You can ding
the little triangle.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.700
I don't want to ding
a triangle.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.068
Just ding the damn triangle!

12:17.070 --> 12:20.572
Never!
Triangles? Candles?

12:20.574 --> 12:21.840
That's girl-band stuff.

12:21.842 --> 12:22.741
We're not a girl band.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.908
Says the guy
wearing the lady's wig.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.779
For your information,
we're trying to
be dee snider.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.681
Who's she?
Never heard of him.

12:29.683 --> 12:31.216
Or his awesome music.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.550
What happened to you, man?

12:32.552 --> 12:34.185
It used to be
about the music

12:34.187 --> 12:37.322
And the mansion
and chuck norris.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.656
You've changed.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.258
No. I evolved.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.393
You're the one who's stuck
in the same place.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.930
I just...Like
being a team.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.999
Guess that's over now.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.534
(sighs)

12:50.836 --> 12:52.170
That...
(door closes)

12:52.172 --> 12:53.204
...Was a bummer,
but, hey.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.974
It's show business,
not show friends,
am I right?

12:55.976 --> 12:57.809
Speaking of that,
we had a band meeting.

12:57.811 --> 12:58.810
When?
Just now.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.512
And we're gonna
have to ask you to leave.

13:00.514 --> 13:01.746
What are you talking about?

13:01.748 --> 13:02.413
You're out of the band.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.282
You keep winking at lainey
and staring at lainey.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.551
And one time,
I saw you smell lainey.
Wait. What?

13:06.553 --> 13:09.587
You're throwing me out
of my own band?
You can't do that.

13:09.589 --> 13:11.189
We just did.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.193
Wait. Barry.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.528
Yeah?

13:16.530 --> 13:18.663
Leave the triangle.

13:18.665 --> 13:19.664
Adult adam:
<i> It was 6:00 p.M. Sharp.</i>

13:19.666 --> 13:23.101
(zipper unzips)
<i> as always, my dad dropped</i>
<i> his pants off from work.</i>

13:23.103 --> 13:27.071
<i> Little did he know,</i>
<i> my mom was about to drop</i>
<i> a bomb on him.</i>

13:27.073 --> 13:28.840
<i> ¶ you take the good,</i>
<i> you take the bad</i>

13:28.842 --> 13:30.942
<i> ¶ you take them both,</i>
<i> and there you have</i>

13:30.944 --> 13:32.510
<i> ¶ the facts of life ¶</i>

13:32.512 --> 13:33.578
Wow!

13:33.580 --> 13:34.612
Shrimp parm.

13:34.614 --> 13:35.713
What's the occasion?

13:35.715 --> 13:36.781
Oh, just a little
thank-you

13:36.783 --> 13:41.686
For all you're doing
to make our renewal
so magical.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.054
Well, it's mostly you,

13:43.056 --> 13:44.756
But I do deserve
some credit.

13:44.758 --> 13:48.359
Gosh, I just
can't stop thinking
about those vows of yours.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.495
How did you come up
with such beautiful words?

13:50.497 --> 13:55.500
Well, I thought,
"I wish we'd been together
for a million years."

13:55.835 --> 13:56.901
And?
And...

13:56.903 --> 13:59.704
"I wish we could be together
for a million more."

13:59.706 --> 14:01.372
That... That...
2 million!

14:01.374 --> 14:05.343
Wow. That is so touching
and from the heart.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.380
Maybe I should share
my vows with you.
Would you like that?

14:09.382 --> 14:11.349
Uh...
Surprise me on the day.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.252
No. No, no, no, no.
I insist.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.386
(chuckles)

14:15.388 --> 14:16.988
"you take the good.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.923
"you take the bad.

14:18.925 --> 14:19.958
"you take them both,

14:19.960 --> 14:23.027
"and then you have
the facts of life."

14:23.029 --> 14:23.628
Oh, boy.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.497
The facts of
(bleep) life!

14:26.499 --> 14:28.233
(spoon clatters)
okay.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.834
Clearly, you're angry.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.503
And I'm willing to take
some of the blame...

14:32.505 --> 14:33.071
Up to 30%.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.340
How hard is it for you
to say you love me?

14:35.342 --> 14:38.776
What do you want from me?
Nothing rhymes with beverly.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.478
It doesn't have to rhyme.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.145
It... You know what?

14:41.147 --> 14:43.014
Don't even bother
with the vows.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.182
I'm canceling it.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.316
Oh, don't do that.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.050
I mean it.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.219
We are never
getting married again... Ever.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.788
Fine. The whole thing
was just a big excuse

14:50.790 --> 14:51.956
To throw yourself
a party, anyway.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.526
Yes, I wanted
to be treated
like a princess,

14:55.528 --> 14:57.495
Because all I do
around here

14:57.497 --> 15:01.499
Is cook and clean
all...Day...Long.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.269
But you know
what I really wanted?

15:05.471 --> 15:10.508
I just wanted to hear you talk
about how much you love me.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.010
(chuckles softly)

15:12.012 --> 15:13.411
Adult adam: <i> My mom</i>
<i> wasn't the only one</i>

15:13.413 --> 15:15.146
<i> Feeling the sting</i>
<i> of disappointment.</i>

15:15.148 --> 15:18.883
(keytar playing discordantly)
<i> even the greatest musical</i>
<i> instrument of the '80s</i>

15:18.885 --> 15:19.751
<i> Couldn't cheer me up.</i>

15:19.753 --> 15:21.486
Since when do you play
keytar?

15:21.488 --> 15:22.353
Since I went solo.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.956
Like david lee roth
with less jumping

15:24.958 --> 15:26.791
'cause of
my ingrown toenail.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.793
I'm kind of
on my own, too.

15:28.795 --> 15:29.961
They kicked me out
of the band.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.997
Oh, doesn't feel good,
does it, you putz?

15:32.999 --> 15:35.633
All right.
Listen.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.436
I'll admit
I got blinded by love.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.804
But I'm back now.

15:39.806 --> 15:40.939
I don't know, man.

15:40.941 --> 15:41.940
Come on.

15:41.942 --> 15:42.840
I got no band
without my drummer.

15:42.842 --> 15:46.544
<i> In one day, we went through</i>
<i> the whole cycle of a band...</i>

15:46.546 --> 15:50.949
<i> The fight, the breakup,</i>
<i> and now the reunion.</i>

15:50.951 --> 15:52.750
You know, even though
my mom canceled our gig,

15:52.752 --> 15:56.120
We're amazing enough to still
become a female supergroup.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.222
For sure.
Let's get famous.

15:58.224 --> 15:59.924
Two, three, four.

15:59.926 --> 16:01.859
(garage door opens)
<i> ¶ close your eyes ¶</i>

<i> ¶ we're not gonna take it</i>

16:16.009 --> 16:19.477
<i> ¶ no, we ain't gonna take it</i>
fine! If that's how
you want to be...

16:19.479 --> 16:20.078
Hit it, lainey.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.046
Adam and barry:
<i> ¶ we're not gonna</i>
<i> take it anymore</i>

16:22.048 --> 16:23.514
Erica and lainey:
<i> ¶ close your eyes</i>

16:23.516 --> 16:25.283
<i> It was an epic</i>
<i> battle of the bands.</i>

16:25.285 --> 16:26.551
<i> Twisted sister vs. Sister.</i>

16:26.553 --> 16:27.952
<i> And even though</i>

<i> Sometimes,</i>

16:32.392 --> 16:35.293
<i> ¶ we're not gonna take it</i>
<i> ¶ do you feel the same?</i>

16:35.295 --> 16:36.427
Enough!
<i> ¶ we're not gonna take it</i>

16:36.429 --> 16:39.197
<i> This was not</i>
<i> one of those times.</i>
<i> ¶ anymore ¶</i>

16:39.199 --> 16:40.198
(amplifier crackles)

16:40.200 --> 16:41.132
Go practice
somewhere else!

16:41.134 --> 16:43.768
(drumming stops)
no! This garage
belongs to us!

16:43.770 --> 16:46.170
I'm sorry, lainey,
but at this point
in my career,

16:46.172 --> 16:47.438
I have to put
the music first.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.507
Barry, what are
you talking about?

16:49.509 --> 16:53.845
I'm talking
about what happened
between us and our tongues.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.847
Why do you deny
our night of passion?

16:55.849 --> 16:58.649
Uh...How much more obvious
can I be?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.318
We're not a thing.

17:00.320 --> 17:00.918
But...

17:00.920 --> 17:03.121
Look, I just don't
like you that way.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.401
(alarm blaring)

17:16.403 --> 17:17.502
What's going on?

17:17.504 --> 17:19.270
Nothing.
Just turn it off.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.339
(alarm clock thuds)
hey.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.409
You set the alarm
to watch the wedding.

17:24.411 --> 17:27.311
Don't not watch it
because you're pissed at me.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.814
Just leave me alone.

17:33.685 --> 17:34.986
What the hell
are you doing?

17:34.988 --> 17:37.055
Can't sleep.
Look at her.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.490
She really is
the people's princess.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.592
I'll never be
anyone's princess.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.394
My destiny
is to die alone.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.595
What are you
talking about?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.697
Why are you being
a dramatic moron?

17:46.699 --> 17:47.098
I suck!

17:47.100 --> 17:50.034
I actually thought
I could land a girl
that's so out of my league.

17:50.036 --> 17:53.404
Hey. It's possible.
Trust me.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.072
No offense, dad,

17:54.074 --> 17:55.973
But you just don't get
what it's like to be me.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.409
Come with me.
I want to show
you something.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.812
(film reel clicking)
look at her.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.713
Talk about
out of my league.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.583
You're sitting
through the ceremony.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.852
My god.
All you do is sit.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.454
It's a problem, really.

18:09.456 --> 18:10.688
Shut up.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.957
Your mother thought
it was low blood sugar.

18:12.959 --> 18:15.960
Actually, I was
just so overwhelmed.
Why?

18:15.962 --> 18:18.596
Look at her.
She's so beautiful and smart.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.932
I never thought
I'd be good enough for her.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.433
Well, this gives me hope.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.504
I mean, you're awful,
and you got mom, so...

18:27.039 --> 18:27.872
Can't give up.

18:27.874 --> 18:31.275
Adult adam:
<i> Sure, what barry said</i>
<i> was needlessly hurtful,</i>

18:31.277 --> 18:32.276
<i> But in that insult,</i>

18:32.278 --> 18:35.746
<i> My dad found</i>
<i> a kernel of wisdom.</i>

18:35.748 --> 18:38.349
Go wake up
the other morons.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.251
You got a gig to play.

18:40.652 --> 18:42.553
<i> ¶ close your eyes</i>

18:42.555 --> 18:46.357
<i> ¶ give me your hand, darlin'</i>

18:46.359 --> 18:50.561
<i> ¶ do you feel</i>
<i> my heart beating?</i>

18:50.563 --> 18:52.964
<i> ¶ do you understand?</i>

18:52.966 --> 18:55.800
<i> ¶ do you feel the same?</i>

18:55.802 --> 19:00.438
(in distance)
<i> ¶ am I only dreaming</i>

19:00.440 --> 19:08.112
<i> ¶ or is this burning</i>
<i> an eternal flame?</i>

19:08.180 --> 19:10.047
<i> ¶ I believe</i>

19:10.049 --> 19:13.684
<i> ¶ it's meant to be, darlin'</i>

19:13.686 --> 19:14.418
Dad.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.087
What's going on?
<i> ¶ I watch you</i>
<i> when you are sleeping</i>

19:16.089 --> 19:20.124
Turns out you get that
perfect wedding after all.

19:20.359 --> 19:24.028
<i> ¶ do you feel the same?</i>

19:24.030 --> 19:27.665
<i> ¶ am I only dreaming</i>

19:27.667 --> 19:35.106
<i> ¶ or is this burning</i>
<i> an eternal flame?</i>

19:35.108 --> 19:40.945
I'm not very good,
uh, with vows.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.813
And, uh...

19:42.815 --> 19:46.984
God knows
I'm not a prince.

19:47.052 --> 19:47.885
Um...

19:47.887 --> 19:51.122
The one thing
I do know for sure

19:51.124 --> 19:53.424
Is you are my princess.

19:53.426 --> 19:59.764
And I am the luckiest nobody
in the world.

20:01.767 --> 20:04.535
Sha-la-la-la.
<i> ¶ say my name</i>

20:04.537 --> 20:07.138
<i> ¶ sun shines through the rain</i>

20:07.140 --> 20:09.740
<i> ¶ a whole life so lonely</i>

20:09.742 --> 20:13.711
<i> ¶ and then come</i>
<i> and ease the pain</i>

20:13.713 --> 20:16.814
Adult adam: <i> Sure, we were far</i>
<i> from royalty or rock gods,</i>

20:16.816 --> 20:21.452
<i> But that night,</i>
<i> my mom felt like a queen.</i>

20:23.322 --> 20:24.121
<i> ¶ close your eyes</i>

20:24.123 --> 20:27.225
Listen,
about what I said.
No.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.026
It's fine. I get it.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.629
You don't feel
the same way about me.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.297
But I'll win you over.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.699
No, you won't.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.466
Yeah, I will.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.868
<i> ¶ do you feel the same?</i>
No. You won't.

20:38.070 --> 20:38.970
Yes, I will.

20:38.972 --> 20:42.473
<i> ¶ am I only dreaming</i>
no, you won't.

20:42.475 --> 20:50.014
<i> ¶ or is this burning</i>
<i> an eternal flame? ¶</i>

21:01.059 --> 21:02.493
Mommy,
I have a question.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.795
So, lainey's going
to ocean city
over the weekend,

21:04.797 --> 21:06.597
And if you let me go,
I will give you

21:06.599 --> 21:09.267
The best snuggies
of your life.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.202
(chair scrapes)
get off!
Don't touch me!

21:11.204 --> 21:13.437
(purse thuds)
god! You've got to stop
wearing that wig.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.639
I keep thinking
you're mom.

21:14.641 --> 21:17.341
What are you talking about?
I look awesome.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.542
Seriously, look at you.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.044
Nope. Don't see it.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.212
Say "I have failed
as a mother."

21:21.214 --> 21:24.415
"I have failed
as a mother."

21:24.583 --> 21:27.585
Adam,
we're getting mohawks!
