02:31.119 --> 02:34.111
(Teacher)
Today, we will
be covering the last

02:34.189 --> 02:38.057
and most interesting
class of rock.

02:38.126 --> 02:42.153
Metamorphic rock is
a very special sort of rock.

02:42.230 --> 02:46.326
It's formed under
the same conditions as igneous rock...

02:46.401 --> 02:48.494
but...

02:48.570 --> 02:52.267
with some very
significant differences.

02:52.340 --> 02:55.332
Guber, see me after class.

02:55.410 --> 02:56.934
Silence, please.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.411
You will all
be tested on this...

02:59.480 --> 03:02.813
as soon as you return
from spring break. Gloria?

03:02.884 --> 03:04.875
Will we have to give
examples of each, sir?

03:04.953 --> 03:07.945
Yes, as Gloria has
quite rightfully pointed out,

03:08.022 --> 03:10.286
you'll be asked to illustrate
the differences

03:10.358 --> 03:14.988
between igneous
and metamorphic rock,

03:15.063 --> 03:18.226
and to provide
specific examples of each.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.231
Gloria?

03:19.300 --> 03:21.097
How many examples
of each, sir?

03:21.169 --> 03:23.103
Will 10 be sufficient?

03:23.171 --> 03:25.002
Three will be fine, Gloria.

03:25.073 --> 03:28.167
Will 10,000 examples
of how amazing I am
be sufficient?

03:28.243 --> 03:30.575
Man, she is so annoying.
I hate it when she does that.

03:30.845 --> 03:32.972
She's okay.
Come on,
are you kidding?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.446
Someone needs
to put her in her place.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.005
You know something
about this stuff.

03:36.084 --> 03:37.483
Your Dad's a geo guy
or something, right?

03:37.552 --> 03:40.544
Geologist.
Right, that's what I said.

03:40.622 --> 03:42.249
I know a bit,
but I'm not going to have

03:42.323 --> 03:44.257
a public nerd-out
for your benefit.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.886
Beside, Guru is just waiting
for an excuse to pound me.

03:46.961 --> 03:48.519
Mr. Winton, I'm not interrupting

03:48.596 --> 03:50.996
your social time, am I?

03:51.065 --> 03:52.259
Know all this, do you?

03:54.335 --> 03:55.893
No, sir.

03:55.970 --> 03:57.437
Boring you, am I?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.598
No, sir.

04:10.585 --> 04:12.246
I see.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.250
Perhaps you would like to come up
to the front of the class

04:20.327 --> 04:24.890
and enlighten us all
with your understandings
of geological metamorphosis.

04:28.202 --> 04:31.433
Well, class, Mr. Winton
has volunteered

04:31.506 --> 04:34.907
to take over
the lesson.

04:34.976 --> 04:37.035
Well, Mr. Winton?

04:37.078 --> 04:39.103
Got nothing to say?

04:39.180 --> 04:42.445
I assumed you
must be an expert.

04:42.517 --> 04:47.181
Why else would you be
so rudely interrupting my class?

04:47.221 --> 04:48.984
So it would appear

04:49.057 --> 04:52.083
that you're nothing more
than a rude little time waster.

04:52.160 --> 04:55.027
Do you know what happens
to time wasters, Mr. Winton?

04:56.931 --> 04:58.592
Hand down, Gloria.

05:00.201 --> 05:01.463
Well, Mr. Winton?

05:03.638 --> 05:05.299
Screw it.

05:05.373 --> 05:07.102
Geological metamorphosis...

05:07.175 --> 05:09.234
Oh, this will be good.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.971
Don't let me interrupt you.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.103
Do go on.

05:15.483 --> 05:18.384
Geological metamorphosis occurs
when a protolith is subjected

05:18.453 --> 05:20.546
to temperatures greater
than 160 degrees Celsius

05:20.621 --> 05:22.282
and pressures of 1,600 bars.

05:22.357 --> 05:24.484
This causes physical
and/or chemical metamorphosis

05:24.559 --> 05:26.254
in the original
protolithic structure.

05:26.327 --> 05:28.955
Under these conditions,
foliation will occur

05:28.997 --> 05:31.465
as the rock shortens along one axis
during recrystallisation.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.227
Platy crystals would
then become rotated

05:33.301 --> 05:35.565
perpendicular to the orientation
of the shortening

05:35.636 --> 05:37.331
causing mineral banding
in the rock.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.373
Another important mechanism
in metamorphosis

05:39.440 --> 05:41.431
is metasomatism,
where the exchange of atoms

05:41.509 --> 05:44.967
between minerals results
in the formation of new minerals.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.179
(Teacher)
Silence!

05:50.251 --> 05:53.243
Silence, or you will all
receive a detention.

05:55.189 --> 06:00.183
And as for you, I will
be speaking to your parents.

06:00.261 --> 06:01.592
Take your seat.

06:11.105 --> 06:12.504
[bell rings]

06:31.492 --> 06:34.427
Look, I'll talk to you later.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.360
Hey, sweetie.
How was your day?

06:36.431 --> 06:37.625
That was Dad, wasn't it?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.495
I'm still going, right?

06:39.567 --> 06:41.364
Relax. Yes, you're still going.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.702
(Lucas )
Wow.

06:53.781 --> 06:56.045
I haven't been
to this place in years.

06:56.117 --> 06:57.584
Yes, well, little did I know

06:57.652 --> 07:00.587
that your father made his mother
a promise never to sell it.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.522
(Lucas )
Then why is there
a for sale sign out front?

07:03.591 --> 07:06.059
(Mother)
I haven't got time to take
care of this old place,

07:06.127 --> 07:09.096
and your Dad obviously
isn't going to do it from overseas.

07:09.163 --> 07:10.790
I have to check on some things.

07:11.065 --> 07:13.397
We'll have plenty of time to
get you to your flight

07:13.468 --> 07:16.198
which, for the record,
I am still not happy about.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.261
Stop worrying, Mom.
I'll be fine.

07:21.242 --> 07:23.733
I don't remember it
being this creepy.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.474
It's like something out of
ghost hunters.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.542
Wait, shh.
Did you hear that?

07:32.620 --> 07:34.679
Hear what?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.780
The screams of a thousand
tormented souIs.

07:36.858 --> 07:38.485
There's definiteIy a
presence here.

07:38.559 --> 07:39.617
Iucas.

07:39.694 --> 07:41.787
You watch
far too much teIevision.

07:43.197 --> 07:47.099
l remember Grandma used
to teII us some pretty crazy stories.

07:47.135 --> 07:49.160
UnfortunateIy,
she was not weII.

07:49.237 --> 07:50.761
It's fine to have
your head in the clouds,

07:50.838 --> 07:53.102
so long as you know
where your feet are.

08:03.584 --> 08:06.417
[phone rings]

08:06.487 --> 08:10.253
Yeah, hello? Yeah.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.621
No, I'm sure.
I just want it sold.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.157
Yes, that's fine.

08:44.225 --> 08:47.820
It will all be out.
Goodbye.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.420
Lucas!

08:49.497 --> 08:50.589
I'm in here.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.767
Ugh, look
at all this junk.

08:54.835 --> 08:58.236
There's actually a lot of
cool stuff in here.

08:58.306 --> 09:00.171
Well, unfortunately,
a bunch of old books

09:00.241 --> 09:02.175
isn't going to help
sell this place.

09:02.243 --> 09:04.302
I just hope it will all be out
in time for the auction.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.471
You're not going to throw
all this stuff out, are you?

09:06.547 --> 09:09.846
Lucas, it's just a bunch
of old, dusty junk.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.545
Just because it's old
doesn't mean you have
to throw it out.

09:12.620 --> 09:16.215
Besides, Grandma's
whole life is in here.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.814
There are times in life, Lucas,

09:17.892 --> 09:21.293
where you just have to
clean out the past and move on.

09:21.362 --> 09:23.353
Hey, can I keep this?

09:23.431 --> 09:25.490
No, come on.
Put it back.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.363
Come on, you don't need
a bunch of old stuff

09:27.435 --> 09:28.868
cluttering up your room.

09:28.903 --> 09:30.495
Come on,
we've got to go.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.596
We've got to get you
to the airport.

09:39.814 --> 09:42.647
Lucas, come on.
We got to go.

09:42.717 --> 09:44.412
Coming.

09:48.222 --> 09:49.780
Whoa.

10:15.850 --> 10:21.254
<i>This is</i>
<i>the final boarding call</i>
<i>for QF181 to Los Angeles.</i>

10:21.322 --> 10:23.517
<i>Please turn off</i>
<i>all electronic devices.</i>

10:23.557 --> 10:25.422
<i>Once airborne, the Captain</i>
<i>will let you know</i>

10:25.493 --> 10:27.620
<i>when you can use</i>
<i>approved electronic devices.</i>

10:27.695 --> 10:30.664
Right down here.
Just by the window.

10:54.989 --> 10:57.423
[muttering]

11:03.631 --> 11:05.496
<i>[Computer]</i>
<i>Caution.</i>

11:05.566 --> 11:08.034
<i>(Captain)</i>
<i>Please fasten</i>
<i>your seatbelts.</i>

11:08.302 --> 11:12.602
4479, we are heading
into turbulence.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.872
[screaming]

11:22.950 --> 11:23.917
Flight tower.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.044
Flight 4479,
we are entering
extreme turbulence.

11:27.321 --> 11:28.982
I repeat...

12:10.664 --> 12:12.598
[radio chatter]

12:36.757 --> 12:38.486
Hello!

12:40.594 --> 12:42.892
Is anyone there?

12:42.963 --> 12:44.555
[distorted chatter]

12:44.632 --> 12:46.395
Hello!

12:48.536 --> 12:52.734
[distorted chatter]

13:00.981 --> 13:04.144
Does anyone
know where I am?

13:05.953 --> 13:08.080
Please, I need help.

13:08.155 --> 13:11.124
[distorted chatter]

13:11.192 --> 13:13.057
Where is that coming from?

13:15.763 --> 13:17.560
[distorted chatter]

13:25.473 --> 13:27.100
My crystal.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.039
What is that
doing here?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.450
Hello!

13:49.763 --> 13:51.526
Hello!

14:04.712 --> 14:07.044
[distorted chatter]

14:34.241 --> 14:35.902
[distorted chatter]

14:40.781 --> 14:42.510
Hello?

14:42.550 --> 14:44.074
Is anyone there?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.744
Hello?

14:47.821 --> 14:49.015
Is anyone there?

14:51.959 --> 14:53.790
Hello?

15:04.705 --> 15:07.799
[gurgling]

15:07.841 --> 15:09.866
[grunting]

15:09.944 --> 15:12.310
Okay. Not good.

15:17.151 --> 15:19.085
[roaring]

15:25.159 --> 15:26.751
Ah!

15:44.912 --> 15:46.106
Ah!

15:46.180 --> 15:47.613
Ah!

15:49.683 --> 15:50.945
[roaring]

15:56.957 --> 15:58.117
[snaps]

16:00.060 --> 16:01.721
Ah!

16:01.795 --> 16:02.727
Ah!

16:03.831 --> 16:05.765
[screaming]

16:24.051 --> 16:26.144
Quickly, remove your shirt.

16:26.220 --> 16:29.155
What?
They're after your shirt.
Remove it.

16:35.763 --> 16:38.323
That's it.
Come on.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.194
Run.

16:58.819 --> 17:00.844
(Lucas )
Hey, where are we going?

17:00.921 --> 17:02.320
[Girl]
You'll see.

17:13.701 --> 17:16.693
Whoa, impressive pad
you got here.

17:19.673 --> 17:21.003
Can I use your phone?

17:21.075 --> 17:22.406
I've been in an accident.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.801
First things first.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.435
I'm Kate. And you are?

17:25.713 --> 17:27.738
Lucas.
Lucas Winston.

17:27.815 --> 17:29.874
Pleased
to meet you, Lucas.

17:29.950 --> 17:31.144
So can I use your phone?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.981
I wasn't expecting company.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.022
The place is a little untidy.
That's okay.

17:36.090 --> 17:38.957
I don't mean to bother you.
You'll have to take me
as you find me.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.823
Life is very busy
at the moment.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.293
No, that's fine.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.887
It's spring, you see.
Mating season.

17:44.965 --> 17:47.832
Which is of course why
the raptors were after your shirt.

17:47.868 --> 17:51.770
What?
The animals are very active
this time of the year.

17:51.839 --> 17:53.363
Sorry, look,
I don't mean to be rude,

17:53.440 --> 17:54.839
but I'm kind of lost.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.398
Oh, how rude of me.

17:56.477 --> 17:58.308
You must be thirsty
after your ordeal.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.868
No, look, I'm fine.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.354
What?

18:08.422 --> 18:10.219
This girl is weird.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.086
Here, drink up.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.991
Kate, please.

18:15.028 --> 18:17.189
Yes. Yes, of course.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.822
You have many questions.

18:18.899 --> 18:20.298
Come, I'll explain
everything.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.761
I really need
to use your phone.

18:23.837 --> 18:24.428
Phone.

18:24.505 --> 18:26.302
Oh, you mean telephone.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.806
Sorry, I don't have one.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.308
Besides,
who would I call?

18:29.376 --> 18:31.276
What about a mobile?

18:31.345 --> 18:33.006
You know, a cell phone.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.844
Well, obviously
I can't sell you a phone

18:35.916 --> 18:36.940
if I don't have one.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.815
Right, okay.

18:38.886 --> 18:40.217
Where are we exactly?

18:40.287 --> 18:42.152
Well, I have
a sneaking suspicion

18:42.222 --> 18:45.783
that we aren't really
any place or any time.

18:45.859 --> 18:48.384
I have a theory that we're in
a place between places.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.293
But that's not really
my field, I'm afraid.

18:50.364 --> 18:52.832
I'm sorry.
You're not really making any sense.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.164
I can't really
make sense of it myself.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.930
All I know is that
it has provided me

18:57.004 --> 18:59.768
the most amazing opportunity
to further my studies.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.808
Studies? Of what?

19:01.875 --> 19:03.103
The dinosaurs, of course.

19:03.177 --> 19:05.304
Palaeontology is my passion.

19:05.379 --> 19:09.315
Although, I'm not quite sure
you can still call it
palaeontology,

19:09.383 --> 19:12.352
particularly considering
that the animals are still
very much alive.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.148
Dinosaurs?

19:14.221 --> 19:16.121
Those animals that attacked you
back in the forest

19:16.190 --> 19:18.283
were hardly your
garden variety bird,
were they?

19:18.358 --> 19:20.553
So you're telling me
those things were dinosaurs?

19:20.828 --> 19:23.058
Dromaeosaurs, to be precise.

19:23.096 --> 19:26.190
Small, carnivorous theropods.
Highly aggressive.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.460
Dinosaurs?

19:27.534 --> 19:30.230
You keep asking me that.

19:30.304 --> 19:33.535
Man, I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

19:33.807 --> 19:35.331
You were actually quite lucky.

19:35.409 --> 19:36.899
Usually a person
in your position

19:36.977 --> 19:38.205
would have been
torn to shreds.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.212
So you saw my plane?

19:40.247 --> 19:42.374
No, I'm talking
about the dromaeosaurs.

19:42.449 --> 19:45.816
You see, male dromaeosaurs
often collect bright colored objects

19:45.853 --> 19:47.286
in order to attract a mate.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.379
They particularly like
blue things

19:49.456 --> 19:50.582
This is nuts.

19:50.858 --> 19:54.555
Right, okay.
I know what's going on here.

19:54.828 --> 19:57.956
I'm asleep.
This is all just a dream.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.226
Wake up, Lucas.
Wake up.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.131
Really, you must stop that.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.033
You're becoming
rather hysterical.

20:04.104 --> 20:06.129
I know this all sounds
a little strange,

20:06.206 --> 20:08.174
but you really must adapt
to the situation.

20:08.242 --> 20:09.470
You're going to have
to learn fast

20:09.543 --> 20:10.840
if you want to survive here.

20:10.911 --> 20:12.242
Survive here?

20:12.312 --> 20:13.904
I'm not staying here.

20:13.981 --> 20:15.448
Look, I appreciate you saving me

20:15.515 --> 20:17.506
from those dromedary things.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.542
Dromaeosaurs.
Avian nos ungulate.

20:19.620 --> 20:23.181
Whatever.
Look, you seem like
a really nice girl,

20:23.257 --> 20:25.282
but I've got to go
and find my plane.

20:25.359 --> 20:27.259
Thanks again for saving me.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.919
Glad we could have
this little chat,

20:28.996 --> 20:31.226
but I think I'd better go.

20:37.204 --> 20:39.536
(Kate )
You can't just go
wandering around at dusk.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.198
It's far too dangerous.

20:41.275 --> 20:42.867
You won't last
the night out there.

20:42.943 --> 20:44.535
Yep, okay.
Thanks.

20:50.150 --> 20:53.051
(Lucas )
Sheesh, what a head case.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.645
Okay, Lucas, think.

20:55.923 --> 21:00.417
Find the plane.
Wait for rescue.

21:00.494 --> 21:02.428
[roaring]

21:18.412 --> 21:20.073
Get a grip, Lucas.

21:20.147 --> 21:22.342
It's probably
just a big old cow.

21:22.416 --> 21:23.678
Hadrosaur, actually.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.543
And that was a distress call.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.314
Look, it really isn't safe.

21:27.387 --> 21:29.480
I think you should stay
here tonight.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.389
Come on, the forest
is no place for us after dark.

21:42.269 --> 21:44.260
I'm sorry if I made you
uncomfortable before.

21:44.338 --> 21:47.637
It's just I haven't spoken
to anyone in such a long time.

21:47.708 --> 21:49.676
I almost feared
I'd forgotten how to.

21:49.943 --> 21:51.205
(Lucas )
That's okay.

21:51.278 --> 21:53.212
How long
have you been here?

21:53.246 --> 21:55.009
(Kate )
Several years, I think.

22:07.527 --> 22:10.018
[whistling]

22:10.097 --> 22:13.498
(Lucas )
So you haven't seen
anyone in years?

22:13.533 --> 22:15.626
You really need to get out more.

22:15.669 --> 22:18.467
I get out every day to
further my work.

22:18.538 --> 22:22.133
My dream is to one day
win a Nobel Prize for science.

22:22.209 --> 22:24.700
[whistling]

22:24.978 --> 22:26.206
Mimos, there you are.

22:27.347 --> 22:30.214
[whistling]

22:30.283 --> 22:32.148
It's okay, he's a friend.

22:32.219 --> 22:33.311
What is that thing?

22:33.387 --> 22:35.287
(Kate)
<i>Mimos, meet Lucas.</i>

22:37.090 --> 22:40.423
[whistles]

22:40.494 --> 22:42.291
I've never seen a bird
like this before.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.057
(Kate)
<i>Well, of course you haven't.</i>

22:44.131 --> 22:47.123
No one has.
He's a Sinonithosaur.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.327
Hey, little guy.

22:48.402 --> 22:50.199
[roars]

22:53.407 --> 22:55.341
I think you
gave him a fright.

22:55.409 --> 22:56.706
[whistling]

22:56.777 --> 22:58.404
Did he just make
all that noise?

22:58.478 --> 23:00.605
(Kate )
Why, yes, that's how
he got his name.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.545
Mimos is from
the Latin word for mime.

23:02.616 --> 23:04.743
He can reproduce
any sound that he hears,

23:05.018 --> 23:06.485
just like
a modern day Lyrebird.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.646
Although, I think
he's far more talented,

23:08.722 --> 23:09.654
aren't you, Mimos?

23:09.723 --> 23:11.554
That is correct.

23:14.094 --> 23:16.426
(Lucas )
What are those for?

23:16.496 --> 23:18.157
That is disgusting.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.028
(Kate )
We eat what we can here.

23:20.100 --> 23:22.227
Try one.
Ugh.

23:22.302 --> 23:23.701
Just kidding.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.601
Actually we have
plenty of food here

23:25.672 --> 23:28.072
and there's always
supplies that come through the mist.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.075
Delightful.

23:30.143 --> 23:32.611
Ugh.
(Kate )
Take a look at this.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.306
It'll bring you up to speed.

23:35.282 --> 23:36.374
What is it?

23:36.450 --> 23:38.111
It's my diary.

23:38.185 --> 23:39.675
Why do I have
to read your diary?

23:39.753 --> 23:42.779
Don't worry, it's not full
of girly memoirs or anything.

23:43.056 --> 23:45.251
It's a record of everything
I've learned to date.

23:45.325 --> 23:47.384
Think of it
like a survival guide.

23:47.461 --> 23:48.723
Survival guide?

23:48.762 --> 23:50.286
Just read it.

23:50.764 --> 23:54.131
Kathryn Rose--
Kate, I prefer Kate.

23:54.201 --> 23:57.227
Kathryn sounds
so old-fashioned.

23:57.304 --> 24:02.298
Kate Rose Thompson.
Birthday, 24th June, 1940.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.501
1940?

24:03.577 --> 24:05.408
I think you gave me
the wrong book.

24:05.479 --> 24:07.242
No, that's it.

24:07.314 --> 24:08.542
1940?

24:08.615 --> 24:10.674
Yes, I'll be
16 next month.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.082
16? Try like 70.

24:13.153 --> 24:14.450
It's 2014.

24:14.521 --> 24:15.749
[distorted voice]
That is all.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.383
Really?

24:19.459 --> 24:20.721
Curious.

24:20.794 --> 24:23.558
That is the second craft
from that century.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.559
Okay, so you mean to tell me
that you're from 1940?

24:28.635 --> 24:30.432
I was born in 1940.

24:30.504 --> 24:33.530
It's 1966
where I come from.

24:33.607 --> 24:35.666
Right, of course it is.

24:35.742 --> 24:37.801
(Kate )
As I said, the question
of when we are

24:37.878 --> 24:40.346
is just as perplexing
as where.

24:40.413 --> 24:41.846
Are you hungry?

24:42.115 --> 24:43.639
I'm going to go fix us
some food.

25:02.402 --> 25:05.269
I've got to find
a way out of here.

25:05.338 --> 25:08.569
[whistling]

25:08.642 --> 25:10.576
Where are we?

25:14.848 --> 25:19.251
Orion, Cannes Major,
Carina.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.287
The Crux Constellation.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.687
[whistles]

25:26.359 --> 25:31.228
Dad, you always told me
to use what I know.

25:31.298 --> 25:35.291
But right now,
I don't know anything.

25:35.335 --> 25:37.929
[whistles]

25:38.205 --> 25:40.196
I'm totally lost.

25:40.273 --> 25:45.267
[whistles]

26:02.762 --> 26:04.821
Whoa, what the--

26:07.367 --> 26:08.527
Cool.

26:15.809 --> 26:18.937
Ugh.
[coughs]

26:36.563 --> 26:37.552
Ah!

26:59.386 --> 27:00.819
Oh.

27:08.028 --> 27:09.791
Ugh.

27:14.601 --> 27:16.364
What on earth are you doing
with my diary?

27:16.436 --> 27:19.928
Defending myself
from a gigantic centipede.

27:20.006 --> 27:23.806
That's not a centipede.
That's an arthropleura.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.834
Well, it was like, ah.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.846
And then I was like, ah.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.609
You should have seen it.
It was massive.

27:29.683 --> 27:31.913
I swear it
was trying to eat me.

27:31.985 --> 27:33.384
Don't be dramatic.

27:33.453 --> 27:35.011
It wasn't going
to eat you.

27:35.288 --> 27:37.347
It might have given you
a nasty bite, but...

27:37.424 --> 27:39.016
What, like a
nasty life-ending bite?

27:39.292 --> 27:40.782
Don't be ridiculous.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.760
At worst you might
experience severe nausea,

27:42.829 --> 27:44.023
vomiting and diarrhea.

27:44.297 --> 27:45.696
Enough.
I get the picture.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.495
This one was just
a baby.

27:47.567 --> 27:49.501
It must have hatched
while I was out.

27:49.569 --> 27:50.558
A baby?

27:50.637 --> 27:52.832
I found the egg weeks ago.

27:52.906 --> 27:55.067
And so you
brought that here?

27:55.342 --> 27:56.900
I was going to study it.

28:00.013 --> 28:03.449
I gave you this to read,
not to use as a swat.

28:03.483 --> 28:04.541
What a mess.

28:04.617 --> 28:06.016
Hey, I'm sorry.

28:06.086 --> 28:07.986
It's not like I
had any other options.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.522
One minute, I'm checking out
your glowy things,

28:10.590 --> 28:12.615
and the next, I'm being attacked
by that, that--

28:12.692 --> 28:13.716
Arthropleura.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.057
Exactly. Ugh.

28:16.329 --> 28:17.796
Curious.

28:17.864 --> 28:20.389
I've never seen one
up this close before.

28:20.467 --> 28:24.563
Mandibles, secondary, maxillipeds.

28:24.637 --> 28:26.366
It's remarkable.

28:26.439 --> 28:28.737
Yeah, remarkably disgusting.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.073
I thought boys were supposed
to be into this sort of stuff.

28:31.344 --> 28:33.107
Slime, snails, and all that.
Ugh.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.075
Relax, it's dead.

28:35.348 --> 28:37.339
See there,
behind its pincers,

28:37.384 --> 28:38.749
those gourd-like shapes?

28:38.785 --> 28:40.343
Those are its venom glands.

28:40.387 --> 28:41.979
They look kind of lethal.

28:42.055 --> 28:44.785
They are remarkably developed
for a creature this size.

28:44.858 --> 28:47.691
Probably best
it didn't bite you.

28:47.761 --> 28:49.956
Actually, it's
remarkably similar to--

28:50.029 --> 28:51.462
[screams]

28:51.531 --> 28:52.623
Kill it!

28:52.699 --> 28:54.394
You kill it!
I already killed it!

28:54.467 --> 28:56.094
[both gasping]

29:10.016 --> 29:11.677
See? I told you.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.981
I had nothing else
to hit it with.

29:14.053 --> 29:18.387
Well, I guess we managed
to accurately capture
the moment.

29:18.458 --> 29:19.516
Ugh.

29:27.734 --> 29:31.670
So, tell me.
What's life like in 2014?

29:31.738 --> 29:33.137
Look, I don't mean
to be rude,

29:33.406 --> 29:34.839
but you seriously don't
expect me

29:34.908 --> 29:36.808
to buy this time travel stuff,
do you?

29:36.843 --> 29:39.573
Well, I'm afraid there's
no other explanation for it.

29:39.646 --> 29:41.136
I can think of a few.

29:41.414 --> 29:43.609
Look, I'll show you.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.620
Look at the dates.

29:48.688 --> 29:51.452
London News,
December 1916.

29:52.659 --> 29:56.425
Pix, May 1967.

29:56.496 --> 29:58.896
That's not
for another two years.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.729
Okay, so you got
a bunch of old newspapers.

30:01.801 --> 30:04.099
That hardly proves
your time travel theory.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.104
How about this?

30:06.139 --> 30:09.597
<i>Daily Post,</i>
October 2040.

30:09.676 --> 30:11.473
Give me that.

30:11.544 --> 30:13.034
Where did you get this?

30:13.112 --> 30:15.842
It came in a cargo plane
a few weeks ago.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.440
Tell me, do you
still have television?

30:18.518 --> 30:19.780
I checked the guide
in that paper

30:19.853 --> 30:21.514
but it was missing.

30:21.588 --> 30:22.919
2040?

30:22.989 --> 30:25.014
I don't have television here,

30:25.091 --> 30:27.457
but I make
my own entertainment.

30:27.494 --> 30:29.860
I like to read my letters.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.921
Sometimes when planes come
through the mist,

30:31.998 --> 30:33.488
they carry mail with them.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.193
Letters are fascinating.

30:35.468 --> 30:36.799
You read people's mail?

30:36.870 --> 30:38.861
Isn't that like
a federal offense?

30:38.905 --> 30:41.601
Well, I know it could
be considered improper,

30:41.674 --> 30:43.938
but so much effort goes
into these letters.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.035
It would be a shame
for them to go unread.

30:49.749 --> 30:51.148
"Dear Mom."

30:51.217 --> 30:52.514
That one is private.

30:53.987 --> 30:55.682
All right.

30:55.755 --> 30:59.555
John Stevenson,
National Fungus Collection,

30:59.626 --> 31:01.924
Bureau of Plant Industry.

31:01.995 --> 31:03.929
That's one
of my absolute favorites.

31:03.997 --> 31:05.157
It's really quite funny.

31:08.735 --> 31:10.600
"Dear Mr. Stevenson,

31:10.670 --> 31:12.069
I seek your urgent assistance

31:12.138 --> 31:13.833
with one of the most
delicate matters.

31:13.907 --> 31:15.135
A few weeks back,

31:15.208 --> 31:16.266
a patient of mine came to me

31:16.543 --> 31:19.171
with a highly aggressive form
of fungal infection,

31:19.212 --> 31:21.180
the likes of which
I've never seen before.

31:21.214 --> 31:22.909
My usual treatments have failed,

31:22.982 --> 31:25.246
and the fungus has
rapidly increased in size.

31:25.518 --> 31:26.985
It now sports growth in the form

31:27.053 --> 31:29.681
of flowering spores
from the patient's posterior."

31:29.756 --> 31:31.951
A flowering butt fungus?

31:32.025 --> 31:33.856
That is disgusting.

31:33.927 --> 31:36.122
(Kate )
Wait, it goes on.

31:36.195 --> 31:40.029
"160 patients now exhibit
the early stages of the infection,

31:40.099 --> 31:42.966
and I fear we may be in the
midst of an epidemic.

31:43.036 --> 31:45.664
Please give this matter
your most urgent attention.

31:45.738 --> 31:48.730
Yours sincerely,
Dr. Gardiner Shaw,
Pullman, Wash."

31:48.808 --> 31:50.105
(Lucas )
Pullman Wash.

31:50.176 --> 31:53.009
Sounds like
they all need a good wash.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.706
Wash is actually
short for Washington.

31:54.781 --> 31:58.114
Washington, the butt fungus
capital of the world.

31:59.319 --> 32:00.980
It's getting late.

32:01.054 --> 32:02.282
I took the liberty
of making you

32:02.555 --> 32:04.955
a place to sleep.
Come on.

32:10.630 --> 32:13.827
Here, this one is from Paris.

32:13.866 --> 32:16.198
Paris. It sounds
so romantic.

32:16.269 --> 32:18.134
I hope to visit there
one day.

32:22.342 --> 32:23.866
"To my sweetheart,

32:23.977 --> 32:26.707
We have now crossed France and
have arrived in Paris.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.077
The weather is surprisingly warm
for this time of the year,

32:29.148 --> 32:30.877
and flowers
are blooming everywhere,

32:30.950 --> 32:32.884
lilacs especially.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.716
I took a delightful tour
of the Eiffel Tower,
the tomb of Napolean

32:35.788 --> 32:38.757
and inside the Louvre,
where most of the works
of art have been removed

32:38.825 --> 32:40.315
for safekeeping."
[snoring]

32:48.201 --> 32:50.066
Good night, future boy.

32:50.136 --> 32:51.262
Sweet dreams.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.107
[whistles]

33:26.773 --> 33:28.798
[radio static]

33:46.192 --> 33:48.820
[rumbling]

33:48.895 --> 33:51.227
[whistling]

34:12.150 --> 34:13.447
Kate, wake up!

34:13.719 --> 34:15.880
Wake up!
Kate, wake up!

34:15.955 --> 34:17.149
Wake up!

34:20.426 --> 34:22.291
Supplies.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.351
Supplies? What?

34:24.397 --> 34:25.989
Wake up.
It's an earthquake.

34:26.065 --> 34:28.295
Stop that.
I'm wide awake.

34:28.367 --> 34:31.234
It's the mist, silly,
and that's an airplane.

34:31.304 --> 34:32.862
What?

34:40.379 --> 34:42.279
Whoa, what is that?

34:42.348 --> 34:44.839
A cargo plane.

34:44.917 --> 34:45.940
The best sort.

34:46.018 --> 34:48.009
The passengers.
They'll be injured.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.850
Don't worry,
there won't be any.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.253
The planes are always empty.

34:51.324 --> 34:53.349
Empty?
What do you mean, empty?

34:53.426 --> 34:55.188
Planes don't
just fly themselves.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.058
What about the crew?

34:57.130 --> 34:59.724
I don't know,
but there's never anyone on board.

34:59.766 --> 35:01.825
Never?
Nope.

35:01.901 --> 35:04.426
There is always lots
of swell stuff, though.

35:04.504 --> 35:07.302
Hang on, if there is
never anyone on board,

35:07.373 --> 35:10.171
then how
did we get here?

35:10.243 --> 35:11.733
I don't know.

35:19.952 --> 35:20.748
Time to go.

35:20.820 --> 35:22.879
Go? Go where?

35:22.922 --> 35:25.220
To get the cargo, of course.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.918
I'm not going anywhere.

35:26.993 --> 35:30.156
I'm going to locate my plane
and get out of here.

35:32.064 --> 35:33.156
Look, there.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.891
Go ahead. Look.

35:43.976 --> 35:45.910
What am I looking at?

35:45.978 --> 35:47.172
What do you see?

35:47.246 --> 35:48.213
Nothing.

35:48.281 --> 35:49.441
Precisely.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.142
That's where
you landed yesterday.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.479
I saw you down there
on the beach

35:52.552 --> 35:54.213
after the mist appeared.

35:54.287 --> 35:56.221
Just you, no one else.

35:56.289 --> 35:58.780
Wait, I see footprints.

36:00.159 --> 36:03.060
Oh, there's only one set.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.794
They're mine, aren't they?

36:06.833 --> 36:08.300
Come on, we really must go.

36:29.388 --> 36:31.948
[low roar]

36:32.024 --> 36:33.821
What is that sound?

36:33.893 --> 36:37.090
[low roar]

36:37.129 --> 36:38.926
What is it?

36:40.533 --> 36:41.830
You'll see.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.171
Those...

36:55.248 --> 36:57.580
those are dinosaurs.

36:57.850 --> 36:59.875
Magnificent, aren't they?

36:59.952 --> 37:01.579
Bernissartensis Iguanodons.

37:01.854 --> 37:03.412
(Lucas )
This is incredible.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.514
[low rumbling]

37:05.558 --> 37:07.025
Those are, like...

37:07.093 --> 37:09.857
like, real.

37:09.929 --> 37:12.523
They are
my absolute favorite.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.624
[low roars]

37:23.009 --> 37:23.566
Look there.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.145
Babies?

37:32.184 --> 37:34.277
Let's get a closer look.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.082
(Lucas )
Won't they eat us?

37:36.155 --> 37:37.520
(Kate )
No, they're herbivores.

37:37.590 --> 37:39.023
Gentle creatures.

37:41.027 --> 37:42.892
(Lucas )
This is amazing.

37:42.962 --> 37:45.430
Hey, little guy.

37:45.464 --> 37:48.433
It's a girl, actually.
Around ten days old.

37:51.404 --> 37:53.565
[low roar]

37:54.974 --> 37:56.635
[low roar]

38:01.247 --> 38:02.612
Go on.

38:02.682 --> 38:04.946
We don't want
to make mommy mad.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.917
[low roar]

38:07.954 --> 38:09.148
Go on.

38:32.211 --> 38:35.612
(Lucas )
So this mist thing is
randomly pulling things in

38:35.681 --> 38:37.546
from all over the place?

38:37.616 --> 38:39.208
(Kate )
Everything
that is here has come

38:39.285 --> 38:42.220
from some other place
or some other time.

38:42.288 --> 38:43.619
You and I, for example.

38:43.656 --> 38:45.283
And even the dinosaurs.

38:55.468 --> 38:57.129
[roars]

38:59.672 --> 39:01.697
(Lucas )
And where does it come from?

39:01.974 --> 39:03.737
(Kate )
All I know is that
it appears regularly

39:04.010 --> 39:05.739
but never at the same time.

39:06.012 --> 39:08.242
Sometimes at night
and sometimes during the day.

39:08.314 --> 39:10.976
And more often than not,
things come through it.

39:11.017 --> 39:14.509
(Lucas )
Okay, so we have mist,
we have seismic activity,

39:14.553 --> 39:16.521
we have radio noise,

39:16.555 --> 39:19.183
and we have craft
from all over the place,

39:19.258 --> 39:21.123
which all adds up
to one thing.

39:22.161 --> 39:23.594
Yes?

39:23.662 --> 39:25.323
I am completely lost

39:25.398 --> 39:28.663
with absolutely no way
of getting home.
Cheer up.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.259
Look on
the bright side.
What bright side?

39:31.337 --> 39:34.534
Well, at least you don't
have to go to school,
for one thing.

39:34.573 --> 39:36.200
I like school.

39:36.275 --> 39:37.708
At least at school
I'm not likely to be

39:37.777 --> 39:39.677
dino food by the end
of first period.

39:39.745 --> 39:40.609
Don't worry.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.044
Just stay close.

39:53.426 --> 39:55.553
Oh, my goodness.

40:00.366 --> 40:04.200
Wow, this is incredible.

40:06.272 --> 40:09.173
Man, look
at all this stuff.

40:12.711 --> 40:15.111
Oh, my gosh.

40:15.181 --> 40:18.082
There's enough chocolate in here
to last us a lifetime.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.515
I was hoping
to find something

40:19.585 --> 40:21.314
a bit more useful
than confectionary.

40:21.387 --> 40:25.084
Useful?
What's more useful than chocolate?

40:25.157 --> 40:27.318
Man, we've just
hit the motherlode.

40:30.262 --> 40:34.596
This is like
the best meal I've had in days.

40:37.269 --> 40:39.737
Do you know a woman
lived to 128

40:39.805 --> 40:42.740
by eating a kilo
of chocolate every week?

40:44.443 --> 40:46.604
I don't really like chocolate.

40:46.679 --> 40:49.546
Okay, you're officially
the weirdest girl
I have ever met.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.640
I mean, who doesn't
like chocolate?

40:51.717 --> 40:53.685
Oh, I love chocolate.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.344
I love it so much.

40:55.387 --> 40:58.288
I--I'd marry it
and I'd put it up

40:58.357 --> 40:59.824
in a condo on the beach and--

41:00.092 --> 41:01.753
and that would be made
out of chocolate,

41:01.794 --> 41:04.092
and even the fridge would be
made out of chocolate,

41:04.163 --> 41:07.621
because if you ran
out of chocolate in the fridge,

41:07.666 --> 41:09.327
you could just eat the fridge.

41:09.401 --> 41:12.393
Okay, I think the heat here
is starting to get to you.

41:12.471 --> 41:14.496
You're starting to lose it.

41:14.573 --> 41:17.235
I'm not losing a thing.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.777
I'm keeping these beauties
safe and sound,

41:19.845 --> 41:22.313
right here on my person.

41:22.381 --> 41:23.370
[sighs]

41:30.589 --> 41:32.386
Hey, come, come, come!

41:34.460 --> 41:36.394
[door opens]

41:36.462 --> 41:37.724
[chatter]

41:42.568 --> 41:46.299
[rustling]

41:46.372 --> 41:47.498
Something is here.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.268
Clean yourself up,
for goodness sake.

41:52.344 --> 41:55.336
[speaking foreign language]

42:02.855 --> 42:04.288
Ah!
Ah!

42:04.323 --> 42:05.449
Let go.
Stop it.

42:05.524 --> 42:06.889
Let go of me.
Ah!

42:09.495 --> 42:11.360
[chattering]

42:11.430 --> 42:13.455
[speaking foreign language]

43:45.024 --> 43:47.015
Stupid.

43:52.965 --> 43:55.399
(Lucas )
What is that smell?

43:55.467 --> 43:58.402
Oh, someone here needs a bath.

43:58.470 --> 43:59.869
It's the flowers.

43:59.938 --> 44:02.873
Flowers, really?
Are you sure?

44:04.009 --> 44:06.273
Nepenthes.

44:06.345 --> 44:08.813
Smells like
a bouquet of armpits.

44:08.881 --> 44:10.508
(Kate )
Fungi Carnivora.

44:10.582 --> 44:12.573
This is not good.

44:18.624 --> 44:20.455
[boys shouting]

44:22.728 --> 44:23.956
Kate...

44:25.030 --> 44:26.361
Let's go.

44:37.476 --> 44:38.568
Oh, no.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.582
[gasps]

44:54.560 --> 44:55.618
Kate, help!

44:55.694 --> 44:57.059
Lucas!

44:57.963 --> 44:59.396
Ah!

45:01.033 --> 45:02.330
Grab hold.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.462
Ah, ah!

45:06.538 --> 45:08.631
Yah, ah!

45:10.042 --> 45:11.669
(Kate )
Lucas, it's got me!

45:11.744 --> 45:14.611
[screams]

45:31.597 --> 45:32.996
Ugh.

45:39.004 --> 45:41.029
[speaking foreign language]

46:54.179 --> 46:56.545
Stop!

46:56.615 --> 47:00.984
Oh! I demand
you let us out right now!

47:01.019 --> 47:04.682
Oh, let us out now!

47:10.896 --> 47:12.955
[radio chatter]

47:22.541 --> 47:25.476
[shouting]

47:52.638 --> 47:54.731
[cheering]

48:00.979 --> 48:04.005
Don't worry, I'll figure out
a way to get out of here.

48:21.533 --> 48:23.865
[speaking foreign language]
Whoa!

48:23.936 --> 48:24.834
What?

48:24.903 --> 48:26.302
It's just a lump of rock.

48:27.973 --> 48:29.668
You must have
a sing sing stone.

48:29.741 --> 48:31.140
Sav--

48:31.209 --> 48:33.177
You no understand
sing sing stone.

48:34.813 --> 48:37.543
Actually, I understand
quite a bit.

48:37.583 --> 48:40.279
Oh, so you think you understand
sing sing stone

48:40.552 --> 48:42.577
better than me?

48:42.654 --> 48:46.920
Huh? It's just a plain old
clump of quartz.

48:46.992 --> 48:48.892
Hmm.

48:48.961 --> 48:50.622
Look, I mean no disrespect,

48:50.696 --> 48:51.856
but I'm really not in the mood

48:51.930 --> 48:54.160
for hearing fairy tales
right now.

48:54.232 --> 48:55.722
Hmm.

48:57.869 --> 49:00.565
[whistles]

49:01.707 --> 49:04.267
[distorted voices]

49:04.343 --> 49:06.038
How are you doing that?

49:08.680 --> 49:09.977
What is it?

49:10.048 --> 49:13.176
Sing sing stone
make them small cloud.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.310
It--it looks like the mist.

49:15.587 --> 49:17.111
Yes, it's the mist.

49:17.155 --> 49:20.682
You have a mist.
Watch it. Look.

49:20.759 --> 49:22.784
[whistles]

49:22.861 --> 49:25.728
[distorted voices]

49:29.001 --> 49:30.969
Ow. It's hot.

49:32.170 --> 49:33.603
Yes, it's hot.

49:43.348 --> 49:46.875
1797. Whoa.

49:46.918 --> 49:48.818
[Man]
Yes, yes, you see this one?

49:48.887 --> 49:51.287
It come from a place,
yeah, from long way.

49:51.323 --> 49:53.814
Sing sing stone
bring him a place here.

49:53.892 --> 49:57.794
So this sing sing stone,
it causes the mist.

49:57.863 --> 49:59.296
Are there more of these?

49:59.364 --> 50:04.097
Oh, yes, yes.
Big, big sing sing stone.

50:04.169 --> 50:06.034
Where?
Where are they?

50:06.104 --> 50:09.801
Oh, place long way,
long way, very long way.

50:09.875 --> 50:14.244
My people return to home place
through the mist.

50:14.312 --> 50:16.746
Sing sing stone take them there.

50:16.815 --> 50:19.181
Where?
How do I get there?

50:19.251 --> 50:20.912
Do you want to go to
your village?

50:20.986 --> 50:22.044
Yes, yes.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.350
My village.  My people.

50:24.423 --> 50:25.981
Very dangerous.

50:26.058 --> 50:28.652
Big fire.
Fire twin.

50:28.727 --> 50:31.924
Under fire twin
you find your way.

50:31.997 --> 50:33.396
What I need to do now
is figure out

50:33.665 --> 50:35.724
a way to get
out of this cage.

50:35.801 --> 50:37.200
Oh, cage.

50:37.269 --> 50:38.395
There is a way.

50:38.670 --> 50:40.331
Up there.

50:47.112 --> 50:48.272
Kate, wake up.

50:48.346 --> 50:49.677
We're getting out of here.

51:24.049 --> 51:25.778
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

51:29.087 --> 51:30.486
Whoa.

51:44.970 --> 51:46.961
[speaking foreign language]

52:05.157 --> 52:07.091
[shouting]

52:25.410 --> 52:27.503
(Lucas )
Whoa, easy boy.

52:27.779 --> 52:30.339
What do you think you're doing?
What are you complaining about?

52:30.415 --> 52:31.882
I saved us, didn't I?

52:31.950 --> 52:33.474
You're going
to get us killed.

52:33.552 --> 52:36.112
I'm going to get us killed?
Are you kidding me?

52:36.188 --> 52:38.179
My plan was
to sneak away quietly,

52:38.223 --> 52:40.453
not to release
a flock of angry birds.

52:40.525 --> 52:42.857
This animal is just juvenile.

52:42.928 --> 52:45.123
Whoa.

52:45.197 --> 52:47.256
It has probably
never flown before.

52:47.332 --> 52:48.526
It still has feathers.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.062
How was
I supposed to know?

52:50.135 --> 52:52.365
In my world, if it
has feathers, it can fly.

52:52.437 --> 52:54.871
These feathers are little
more than natal down.

52:54.940 --> 52:57.135
Pterosaurs lose these
when they reach maturity.

52:57.209 --> 52:59.939
Look, it was better than
being tortured

53:00.011 --> 53:02.275
by a tribe of angry natives.

53:02.347 --> 53:04.338
But then, you knew
all about the natives

53:04.416 --> 53:07.544
long before they found us,
didn't you, Kate?
That's right.

53:07.819 --> 53:10.481
I know that you obviously
don't want me to find my way home.

53:10.555 --> 53:11.988
Well, you know what, Kate?

53:12.057 --> 53:15.549
I have things to live for,
I have people that care about me.

53:15.827 --> 53:17.954
I'm sorry you don't,
but I have a life.

53:17.996 --> 53:21.227
I have a good life,
and I'm going to get it back.

53:45.523 --> 53:47.457
Look, I'm sorry.

53:47.525 --> 53:50.016
It's probably my fault
that we're in this predicament.

53:50.095 --> 53:51.562
Probably?

53:51.630 --> 53:53.564
I can be a little impulsive
at times.

53:53.632 --> 53:56.328
Just, I couldn't bear the thought
of being alone again.

53:56.401 --> 53:58.995
And I can't go back,
I just can't.

53:59.070 --> 54:01.470
There's still so much
I need to understand.

54:01.539 --> 54:04.269
Like the pterosaurs.

54:04.342 --> 54:07.402
Aren't they the most graceful
creatures you've ever seen?

54:07.479 --> 54:09.379
Oh, my goodness.

54:09.447 --> 54:10.880
(Kate )
I know.

54:14.019 --> 54:17.045
Look at the way their wings
effortlessly direct the air over--

54:17.122 --> 54:18.521
No, not that.
Forget the birds.

54:18.590 --> 54:20.057
Look, there.

54:21.526 --> 54:24.154
The twin fire mountains.

54:24.229 --> 54:26.493
He was talking
about the volcanoes.

54:26.564 --> 54:30.432
"Beneath the fire twins
you will find your way."

54:30.502 --> 54:32.163
The conditions would be perfect

54:32.203 --> 54:34.433
for massive crystal growth.

54:34.506 --> 54:36.440
Fire mountains?
Crystals?

54:36.508 --> 54:38.442
What are you talking about?

54:38.510 --> 54:41.968
Ernest. Ernest
and his singing stones.

54:42.047 --> 54:46.177
He was trying to describe
a massive piezoelectric
crystal cluster.

54:46.251 --> 54:50.915
The seismic activity
must cause it to attain
its resonant frequency.

54:50.989 --> 54:53.457
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

54:53.525 --> 54:55.459
I'll explain everything,

54:55.527 --> 54:59.691
but first I have to get this
little guy to change course.

54:59.965 --> 55:02.331
That's it, easy.

55:02.367 --> 55:06.463
No, no, no.
We're trying to go this way.

55:06.504 --> 55:07.596
What are you doing?

55:07.672 --> 55:09.663
You'll never get it away
from its flock.

55:09.941 --> 55:12.136
We'll see about that.
Hold on.

55:18.283 --> 55:20.217
Hang on!

55:20.285 --> 55:22.617
He's flying too low.

55:22.687 --> 55:24.621
Whoa!

55:26.624 --> 55:28.615
[crash]

55:44.576 --> 55:45.975
Lucas!

55:49.147 --> 55:50.512
Lucas!

55:52.250 --> 55:53.649
Over here!

55:55.387 --> 55:57.048
Are you okay?

55:58.423 --> 56:00.516
That was awesome.

56:00.558 --> 56:02.423
What on earth
were you thinking?

56:05.563 --> 56:09.659
What I was thinking was we
could get out of here.

56:09.701 --> 56:13.137
Well, now we need to figure out
where here is.

56:13.171 --> 56:18.734
Exactly 8.7 miles
southeast of the volcanoes.

56:19.010 --> 56:21.376
I triangulated our position
before we crashed.

56:25.083 --> 56:29.281
What? I took a celestial
navigation class online.

56:29.354 --> 56:30.685
I was bored.

56:30.755 --> 56:32.245
Forget it.
Come on.

56:45.603 --> 56:48.470
We have to get back to the treehouse
before nightfall.

56:48.540 --> 56:50.565
We're not going back
to the treehouse.

56:50.608 --> 56:52.075
What?

56:52.143 --> 56:53.770
We're going to the volcanoes.

56:54.045 --> 56:56.172
We should reach the ash plain
within a few hours.

56:56.214 --> 56:58.239
From there it should be
pretty easy going,

56:58.316 --> 57:00.750
unless you want
to get Junior back there
up in the air again.

57:00.819 --> 57:02.116
Lucas Winton.

57:02.187 --> 57:03.586
I am not taking another step

57:03.655 --> 57:07.614
until you explain to me exactly
where you think you're going and why.

57:11.196 --> 57:13.391
Here, take a look at this.

57:13.465 --> 57:14.762
Whatever for?

57:14.833 --> 57:15.561
Look at it.

57:15.633 --> 57:17.123
What do you see?

57:17.202 --> 57:19.067
It's just
a plain old crystal.

57:19.137 --> 57:20.729
I used to have one just like it.

57:20.772 --> 57:22.330
There's nothing plain about it.

57:22.407 --> 57:23.431
Take a look at this.

57:23.508 --> 57:25.476
[whistles]

57:28.613 --> 57:29.602
What is it?

57:29.681 --> 57:30.773
Keep watching.

57:30.849 --> 57:33.477
[whistles]

57:33.551 --> 57:35.416
[distorted voice]

57:35.487 --> 57:36.852
It looks
just like the mist.

57:37.122 --> 57:39.852
It is the mist, but the mist is
simply a by-product.

57:40.125 --> 57:42.218
Keep watching.
[whistles]

57:46.164 --> 57:47.825
Oh, my goodness.

57:48.099 --> 57:49.088
Where did it come from?

57:49.134 --> 57:50.226
I don't know.

57:50.301 --> 57:52.269
That was incredible.

57:52.337 --> 57:55.670
Now imagine hundreds of these
but bigger.

57:55.740 --> 57:58.538
Something like that
could create enough energy

57:58.610 --> 58:02.273
to make an electrostatic mist
to cover over hundreds of miles.

58:02.347 --> 58:05.248
You see, somewhere
beneath those volcanoes

58:05.283 --> 58:08.548
is a huge cluster of these things
that is pulling everything in.

58:08.620 --> 58:10.383
This is our key
to getting out of here.

58:10.421 --> 58:13.254
This is our way home.

58:13.291 --> 58:15.589
Okay, but as you
rightly pointed out,

58:15.660 --> 58:17.457
the mist
pulls things in.

58:17.529 --> 58:20.396
I've never witnessed
anything being pulled out.

58:20.431 --> 58:22.399
I--I think
that is just a matter

58:22.467 --> 58:24.526
of changing
the frequency or polarity.

58:24.602 --> 58:26.661
Kind of like
tuning your radio.

58:26.738 --> 58:28.672
A radio, of course.
The radio noise.

58:28.706 --> 58:32.198
Why didn't I think of this before?
What?

58:32.277 --> 58:34.609
You saw what just happened.
It's Newton's Third Law.

58:34.679 --> 58:37.876
For every action, there is
an equal and opposite reaction.

58:38.149 --> 58:40.811
So, we tune in to the correct
resonance frequency,

58:40.885 --> 58:43.183
reverse the polarity
of the piezoelectric charge

58:43.254 --> 58:44.721
and booyah, we're out of here.

58:46.558 --> 58:48.890
How do you propose we do
whatever it is you just said?

58:49.160 --> 58:52.254
I--I don't quite know,
but I'm going to find out.

58:56.467 --> 58:58.162
So, what do you say?

59:00.638 --> 59:02.162
Run!

59:14.619 --> 59:16.211
It's gaining on us.

59:34.639 --> 59:36.470
Kate, what do we do?

59:48.353 --> 59:49.650
Junior.

01:00:10.842 --> 01:00:12.707
Now we're completely lost.

01:00:12.777 --> 01:00:15.473
Don't worry. We're actually
not that far off track.

01:00:15.546 --> 01:00:17.639
Help me find
a straight stick.

01:00:36.668 --> 01:00:37.692
Will this do?

01:00:37.769 --> 01:00:39.259
Perfect.

01:00:46.911 --> 01:00:48.742
This will give me an
east/west line.

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:51.976
From there I can figure out
exactly where we are.

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:53.415
Now what?

01:00:53.451 --> 01:00:55.282
We wait.

01:00:55.353 --> 01:00:56.820
What are we
waiting for exactly?

01:00:56.888 --> 01:00:58.446
The sun to move.

01:01:04.595 --> 01:01:07.621
Oh, come on.
We need that.

01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:13.833
He's a baby.
He wants to play.

01:01:13.871 --> 01:01:15.736
This is no time for games.

01:01:15.807 --> 01:01:18.799
We've got to get our bearings
and get out of here.

01:01:18.876 --> 01:01:21.970
Shoo! Go!
Go and play.

01:01:22.046 --> 01:01:24.571
[grunts]

01:01:26.584 --> 01:01:30.714
Oh, great.
Now he's crying.

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.585
That's not great, actually.

01:01:32.657 --> 01:01:34.989
He has attracted
unwanted attention.

01:01:40.832 --> 01:01:42.993
[growls]

01:01:49.574 --> 01:01:50.871
(Kate )
What are you doing?

01:01:50.942 --> 01:01:52.739
It can't see us
if we don't move.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.573
Where did you get
that ridiculous notion?

01:01:54.645 --> 01:01:56.875
It can see you just fine.
Come on.

01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:11.494
Kate!
Follow me.  Run diagonally.

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:12.824
It will slow it down.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.990
[roars]

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:26.037
Head for the herd!

01:02:57.775 --> 01:02:59.106
I think we lost it.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:06.776
[growls]

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:17.788

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:23.930
Quick! Go!

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.764
[roars]

01:03:25.837 --> 01:03:27.532
Go, go, go!

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.703
[roars]

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:38.979
Lucas, hurry!

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:42.547
[roaring]

01:03:51.162 --> 01:03:52.754
Yeah!

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.627
You're not so tough now,
are you?

01:03:56.534 --> 01:03:58.661
In your face!

01:03:58.736 --> 01:04:00.465
[roars]

01:04:03.241 --> 01:04:04.503

01:04:11.482 --> 01:04:12.744
(Lucas )
How did he get here?

01:04:12.817 --> 01:04:14.079
He has a tendency
to turn up

01:04:14.151 --> 01:04:15.880
in the most odd places.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.616
That is correct.
[whistles]

01:04:20.925 --> 01:04:23.826
Yeah, that's right.
You better run.

01:04:27.865 --> 01:04:31.665
Well, I sure showed him
who's boss.

01:04:31.736 --> 01:04:32.964
[imitates ding]

01:04:52.590 --> 01:04:53.818
(Lucas )
Wow.

01:04:53.891 --> 01:04:56.155
(Kate )
This is incredible.

01:04:57.828 --> 01:05:00.592
I can't believe it.

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:08.938
I've never seen
this many wrecks before.

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:16.945
So, where are
these crystals of yours?

01:05:17.014 --> 01:05:19.812
We're probably standing
on a lot of them right now,

01:05:19.884 --> 01:05:23.650
but the concentrated source
is right beneath those volcanoes.

01:05:23.721 --> 01:05:25.313
That is where we are headed.

01:05:30.895 --> 01:05:33.227
[imitates siren]

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:36.698
We're not going
anywhere near them.

01:05:36.734 --> 01:05:38.099
Come on,
this is your chance

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:40.330
to show the world
what you know.

01:05:41.906 --> 01:05:43.066
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.131
Just stay close.

01:06:07.131 --> 01:06:08.291
Ah!

01:06:08.366 --> 01:06:11.335
(Kate )
What?

01:06:11.602 --> 01:06:14.366
(Lucas )
It's those things that attacked me
back in the forest.

No, no, no.

Wow, we found it.

01:08:35.379 --> 01:08:37.142
This is it.

01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:40.774
I knew it had to be here.
I just knew it.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.285
(Kate )
I have to say this is
rather remarkable,

01:08:43.354 --> 01:08:46.288
but how can you be sure
it's going to get us home?

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:48.188
(Lucas )
Oh, it will get us home,
all right.

01:08:48.259 --> 01:08:50.283
This is what has been pulling
everything in.

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:53.785
The ships,
the planes, everything.

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.161
(Kate )
But how?

01:08:55.232 --> 01:08:58.429
I'm pretty sure it's caused
by the seismic activity.

01:08:58.502 --> 01:08:59.491
What do you mean?

01:08:59.770 --> 01:09:01.761
The quakes.

01:09:01.839 --> 01:09:04.774
Okay, so you're saying that
the earthquakes

01:09:04.809 --> 01:09:08.301
caused the crystals to create
the mist.  Sort of.

01:09:08.379 --> 01:09:10.904
An earthquake vibrating
at just the right frequency

01:09:10.948 --> 01:09:12.381
will cause
the crystals to generate

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:14.974
a piezo-electric discharge.

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:18.385
Okay, assuming for starters that
I understood any of that,

01:09:18.455 --> 01:09:21.322
you're not suggesting that we
wait for another earthquake, are you?

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:26.196
What are you doing?

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.322
Perfect.
You'll see.

01:09:30.401 --> 01:09:33.928
[jar singing]

01:09:40.344 --> 01:09:42.971
Do we have
any water left?

01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:45.207
Water? Yes.

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:48.011
[whistles]

01:09:51.822 --> 01:09:54.814
[jar singing]

01:09:54.892 --> 01:09:57.156
[creaking]

01:09:57.228 --> 01:09:58.286
Little bit more.

01:10:04.969 --> 01:10:06.459
[jar singing]

01:10:06.537 --> 01:10:07.561
Come on.

01:10:07.838 --> 01:10:10.238
[creaking]

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.244
It's working.

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:23.252
It's working.

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.220
I told you
it would work.

01:10:25.289 --> 01:10:27.484
[whistling]

01:10:33.564 --> 01:10:35.395
Oh, my goodness.

01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:39.266
(Lucas )
This is our way out of here.

01:10:39.303 --> 01:10:40.930
We're going to get home.

01:10:42.006 --> 01:10:43.439
[roar]

01:10:49.013 --> 01:10:51.004
Kate, he's got Mimos.

01:10:55.386 --> 01:10:57.081
(Kate )
I have an idea.

01:10:57.154 --> 01:10:59.418
Come on.

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:02.425
That's it.
You want it.

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:05.155
Come on.
You want it?

01:11:07.965 --> 01:11:09.159
Come and get it.

01:11:17.975 --> 01:11:19.340
[gasps]

01:11:27.985 --> 01:11:29.179
Mimos!

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:33.982
No, Mimos.

01:11:34.058 --> 01:11:35.548
[Kate cries]

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:44.060
No.

01:11:48.205 --> 01:11:51.038
Kate.
No.

01:11:51.108 --> 01:11:52.507
I am...

01:11:52.576 --> 01:11:54.476
I'm so sorry.

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:02.277
Come on. I'll...

01:12:02.353 --> 01:12:04.651
I'll take you home.

01:12:04.722 --> 01:12:07.350
I'll take you back to
the treehouse.

01:12:07.391 --> 01:12:09.951
What?

01:12:10.027 --> 01:12:11.654
The jar,
it--it's gone.

01:12:14.098 --> 01:12:15.963
It can't
attain resonance.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.991
Use what you know.

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:19.262
I know you can.

01:12:19.336 --> 01:12:21.270
I can't.

01:12:24.575 --> 01:12:29.410
[singing sound]

01:12:32.016 --> 01:12:33.278
Kate.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:34.647
Look.

01:12:38.455 --> 01:12:43.984
[imitating singing jar]

01:12:44.061 --> 01:12:46.120
[chirps]

01:12:46.196 --> 01:12:48.721
Mimos.
Mimos.

01:12:48.999 --> 01:12:50.261
(Lucas )
He's okay.

01:12:58.642 --> 01:13:02.305
[imitates jar singing]

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:05.314
Kate, he's activating
the crystals.

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:29.198
(Kate )
Quick Mimos, it's okay.
Go. Go home.

01:13:29.273 --> 01:13:30.763
Quick,
it's happening.

01:13:31.041 --> 01:13:33.339
We've got to go.
I've got to get the diary.

01:13:36.313 --> 01:13:38.304
(Lucas )
The portal is opening.

01:13:44.588 --> 01:13:46.317
I can't reach it.

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:48.517
Kate, leave it.
Forget the diary.

01:13:48.592 --> 01:13:50.150
We've to go.

01:13:52.096 --> 01:13:53.222
Come on.

01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:04.070
This is it.
This is it.

01:14:04.141 --> 01:14:06.507
We're finally going to
get out of here.

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:11.471
We're going to get home.

01:14:11.515 --> 01:14:13.415
I have to get the diary.

01:14:13.484 --> 01:14:16.078
What?
I have to go back.

01:14:16.153 --> 01:14:18.747
There's no time.
You'll never make it.

01:14:22.259 --> 01:14:23.556
I have to try.

01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:25.288
I can't go home
without it.

01:14:25.362 --> 01:14:26.693
No one will ever
believe me.

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:28.424
Don't you see?

01:14:28.499 --> 01:14:30.364
The diary is a record
of everything here.

01:14:30.434 --> 01:14:32.163
It's my only proof.

01:14:32.236 --> 01:14:34.466
What are you talking about?
I'm your proof.

01:14:34.538 --> 01:14:36.403
I've seen everything
you've seen.

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:38.532
I know
everything you know.

01:14:38.609 --> 01:14:40.509
What do you know, Lucas?

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:43.138
I mean, what do you really
know for sure?

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:44.646
What can you prove?

01:14:44.681 --> 01:14:47.377
You see, we can't prove anything.

01:14:47.417 --> 01:14:49.112
The world needs proof.

01:14:49.153 --> 01:14:51.644
Without it, all we have
is crazy stories.

01:14:51.722 --> 01:14:54.589
Without proof, in time,
even if it comes out

01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:55.852
what we've seen here.

01:14:56.126 --> 01:14:58.458
I can't live like that.

01:14:58.529 --> 01:14:59.723
I'll be fine.

01:14:59.796 --> 01:15:01.661
I'll be right behind you.

01:15:01.698 --> 01:15:04.258
No. Kate, wait.

01:15:09.907 --> 01:15:11.807
Kate!

01:15:13.477 --> 01:15:15.274
[radio chatter]

01:15:26.190 --> 01:15:27.680
[radio static]

01:15:30.294 --> 01:15:34.492
[Newscaster]

<i>where this mystery island</i>

01:15:34.565 --> 01:15:36.692

01:15:36.733 --> 01:15:39.429

<i>So that sort of raises</i>
<i>all sorts of conspiracy--</i>

01:15:51.515 --> 01:15:54.643
Sweetheart, you're awake.

01:15:54.718 --> 01:15:56.447
How are you feeling?

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.215
Mom, I--

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:00.222
I had a really bizarre dream.

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:03.384
There was
a treehouse and a girl

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.257
and the--the crystals.

01:16:05.329 --> 01:16:06.921
Dad, the crystals.

01:16:07.197 --> 01:16:08.960
Take it easy, Lucas.
You've had quite an ordeal.

01:16:12.536 --> 01:16:14.595
We'll be back soon,
sweetie.

01:16:14.638 --> 01:16:17.937
We're just going to go talk
to the doctors, okay?

01:16:34.491 --> 01:16:36.516
Nana Kathryn.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:37.958
What are you doing here?

01:16:38.228 --> 01:16:40.287
I--I thought
you were in that place.

01:16:40.364 --> 01:16:42.229
They said you were sick.

01:16:43.967 --> 01:16:46.902
Kate, I prefer Kate.

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:50.462
Kathryn is so old fashioned.

01:16:57.848 --> 01:16:59.440
Kate?

01:16:59.516 --> 01:17:02.883
I told you
I'd be right behind you.

01:17:12.396 --> 01:17:15.923
[Man]
It is with great pleasure
that I welcome to the stage

01:17:15.966 --> 01:17:19.265
this year's recipient
of the Nobel Prize

01:17:19.303 --> 01:17:24.331
for achievement in science,
Dr. Kate Rose Thompson.

01:17:24.408 --> 01:17:25.841
[applause]

01:17:25.909 --> 01:17:27.934
Thank you.
It's been a dream of mine

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:31.003
since I was very young
to win this award.

01:17:31.281 --> 01:17:34.409
It's a great honor,
a great honor.

01:17:34.484 --> 01:17:37.544
My team and I have
verified the discovery

01:17:37.621 --> 01:17:39.953
of a living Arthropleura

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:44.323
and so many other creatures
thought to be extinct.

01:17:44.394 --> 01:17:48.660
We've done this through
the successful extraction

01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:52.429
and analysis taken from
the specimen

01:17:52.469 --> 01:17:57.839
so carefully preserved
in my old blue field diary.

01:17:57.874 --> 01:18:00.434
[laughter]

01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:02.501
[Man]
Dr. Thompson, how do you feel

01:18:02.579 --> 01:18:04.706
about the few critics out there
who claim

01:18:04.748 --> 01:18:08.343
that this is merely
a genus of giant centipede?

01:18:09.953 --> 01:18:13.480
That, my dear,
is not a centipede.

01:18:13.557 --> 01:18:15.422
It's an Arthropleura.

01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:22.890
