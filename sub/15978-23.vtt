WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.206
Where's Uncle Nathan?

00:05.239 --> 00:07.141
He and Ray are living
on the streets

00:07.175 --> 00:09.143
for an undercover
investigation.

00:09.177 --> 00:12.546
Several homeless people said
a van has been snatching them up

00:12.580 --> 00:14.282
and dropping them off
across the state line.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.650
Stay away from vans, sweetie,

00:16.684 --> 00:19.053
they are rolling evil.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.155
Vans don't hurt people, Carol.

00:21.189 --> 00:25.226
People with vans hurt people.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.131
Hey, how come you get to
sleep in the bigger box?

00:30.164 --> 00:31.165
I'm taller.

00:31.199 --> 00:35.169
Finders, keepers;
it's the law of the street.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.404
Plus, we're the
same height, anyway.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.538
Sure, standing up...

00:37.571 --> 00:39.773
but when I lay down, I spread.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.176
I'm like a stick of butter
in a hot pan.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.377
That's ridiculous.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.212
(laughs)

00:44.245 --> 00:45.346
You don't believe me?

00:45.379 --> 00:46.514
Lie down.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.154
Aw, come on, Ray. No way.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.322
(laughing)

00:54.355 --> 00:55.456
Finders, keepers!

00:55.489 --> 00:57.725
That's the law of
the street, baby!

00:57.758 --> 01:00.261
I think he's crazy
to be out there

01:00.294 --> 01:02.130
living in a box
with hidden cameras.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.597
Waiting to be kidnapped.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.134
If they harm one hair
on his body--

01:06.167 --> 01:07.067
(laughs)
Good luck.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.503
That thing's waxed cleaner
than a Ken doll.

01:11.772 --> 01:12.673
I'm proud of Nathan.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.842
The more risks you take on
as a reporter,

01:14.875 --> 01:16.210
the higher up
the chain you go.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.712
It's like the Scud Stud
from the Gulf War.

01:18.746 --> 01:23.217
Or, uh... when Katie Couric
did her colonoscopy on TV.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.486
That's-that's how you
make a name for yourself;

01:25.519 --> 01:26.587
dodging missiles.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.790
Or, showing America
your pooper.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.329
Yeah, and it's,
it's only for a week, Mom.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.198
Nathan said if he's
not kidnapped by Sunday,

01:37.231 --> 01:38.899
he'll come home.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.235
You know and he, he's not
out there alone.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.736
Ray has his back.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.406
NATHAN:
Ow! Get off my back!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.375
RAY:
Get out of my house!

01:47.408 --> 01:50.178
NATHAN:
This is not your house!

02:22.710 --> 02:24.345
Mom, what are you
doing to my calendar?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.947
Just highlighting Sunday
as Mother's Day,

02:26.980 --> 02:30.351
so you don't forget again.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.853
Yeah. It was one time,
and I was six years old.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.424
Nathan didn't forget
Mother's Day when he was six.

02:36.457 --> 02:39.860
He dressed in a tiny tuxedo
and asked me to marry him.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.762
Aw...

02:41.795 --> 02:42.963
And 35 years later,

02:42.996 --> 02:44.898
he seems to have
gotten his wish.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.534
(laughs)

02:46.567 --> 02:47.801
After living in Myrtle Beach,

02:47.835 --> 02:48.902
I sure am looking forward to

02:48.936 --> 02:50.771
getting back to
our old traditions.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.840
We'll have brunch at
LaRosa Bistro

02:52.873 --> 02:55.776
and then spend the
rest of the day at Nathan's.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.879
What about Motherless Day?
"Motherless Day"?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.814
Yeah. It's how we celebrate
Mother's Day.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.516
I get a vacation
from being a mom.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.785
Mikayla get's a vacation
from having one.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.720
No rules. No nagging.
No judgment.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.657
It's the most fun day ever.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.725
Last year,
I called dad "Adam" all day,

03:11.759 --> 03:13.193
and then I peed in the sink.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.631
Yeah, Motherless Day is a
tradition that my mom started

03:17.665 --> 03:18.899
back in the commune.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.901
For one day, she could do
whatever she wanted.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.769
And then, nine months later,

03:21.802 --> 03:23.537
I'd usually have another
half-sibling.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.973
Well, when I'm dead,

03:26.006 --> 03:28.242
you can go back to being
lawless hooligans.

03:28.276 --> 03:29.910
Wait a minute,
so you expect us

03:29.943 --> 03:31.512
to change our plans?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.813
Do you know how awful

03:32.846 --> 03:35.316
the last ten Mother's Days
have been for me?

03:35.349 --> 03:36.617
Other than your brother
sending me

03:36.650 --> 03:38.719
a beautiful bouquet of flowers
and a wonder poem,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.688
I would be forced
to spend my entire day

03:40.721 --> 03:43.524
alone with your father.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.994
Yes... 24 hours alone
with your mother;

03:47.027 --> 03:50.030
that was my Vietnam.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.933
And I fought in Vietnam.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.004
Okay. Fine. You win.
There'll be no Motherless Day.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.606
Aw, come on, Deb.
That's our tradition.

03:58.639 --> 03:59.973
I mean, what are you gonna
get rid of next?

04:00.007 --> 04:02.009
Naked Easter? Naked Labor Day?

04:02.042 --> 04:04.778
Daylight Naked Time?

04:04.812 --> 04:06.314
I'm sorry, Adam, but we'll

04:06.347 --> 04:07.681
go to brunch at LaRosa Bistro

04:07.715 --> 04:08.916
and then we'll
head over to Nathan's.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.519
But I promise you, when the
clocks move forward this year,

04:11.552 --> 04:13.020
our clothes will come off.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.527
Hello.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.761
Anybody home...

04:20.794 --> 04:22.262
less?

04:23.964 --> 04:24.998
Oh, Nate's...

04:25.032 --> 04:25.999
he's in his bedroom.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.436
Be careful though,
he's not in a great mood.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.637
And neither am I.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.973
But we promised,
we'd never go to box angry!

04:34.942 --> 04:36.410
Well, maybe I'm angry because

04:36.444 --> 04:38.479
somebody stole all the rainwater
that I collected.

04:38.512 --> 04:41.982
That you collected
in my eggshells!

04:43.417 --> 04:44.485
Whoa... (smacking lips)

04:44.518 --> 04:46.320
That one had ants in it.
(spitting)

04:46.354 --> 04:47.688
Good!

04:47.721 --> 04:48.889
Hey, uh... brought you
some leftovers.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.957
Oh. Thanks.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.460
I'm starving.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.028
So, Nathan, what are you gonna
do when you get home on Sunday?

04:55.062 --> 04:56.063
Oh... I'm gonna take a shower,

04:56.096 --> 04:58.699
get in a clean bed
and sleep for like 24 hours.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.501
Well, yeah, I know,
but Sunday is--

05:00.534 --> 05:01.935
Come on, Debbie,
I just want to rest.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.537
Okay?

05:03.571 --> 05:04.972
And I, I know
that probably means

05:05.005 --> 05:06.740
that I'm gonna miss
Mikayla's soccer game, but...

05:06.774 --> 05:08.075
sorry, it's not really soccer.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.743
They all just
run towards the ball.

05:11.645 --> 05:15.082
It's like throwing a
piece of bread in a duck pond.

05:15.115 --> 05:19.720
So... Sunday is just about you?

05:19.753 --> 05:20.854
N-Nobody else?

05:20.888 --> 05:23.491
It's...
basically just Nathan's Day?

05:23.524 --> 05:26.460
I think I deserve that.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.662
Yes, you certainly do.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.503
Nathan forgot Mother's Day!

05:35.536 --> 05:38.772
He forgot Mother's Day...!

05:41.108 --> 05:43.944
Damn it, this would have better
if someone were in here.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.588
I can't believe we're spending
Motherless Day making Carol

05:54.622 --> 05:57.090
a fruit smoothie for when
she wakes up.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.492
Tell me about it.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.994
I filled a pillowcase
full of Skittles

06:01.028 --> 06:03.831
and put Bad Grandpa
on the DVR for nothing.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.667
Yeah. Sorry, guys.
I'll make it up to you.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.768
It's just, it's not every day

06:07.801 --> 06:09.136
I get to outshine
my brother, you know?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.538
Oh. Oh. Here.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.639
Put in some more coffee beans.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.441
I want mom really buzzing
when she goes off on Nathan.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.444
What are you doing here?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.011
(deeply inhales)

06:18.045 --> 06:19.112
(high-pitched):
Run, Munchkins!

06:19.146 --> 06:21.114
It's the
Wicked Witch of the West!

06:21.148 --> 06:24.885
Stop it, Tom. You can't afford
to kill any more brain cells.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.188
Is that my mommy I hear?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.923
Happy Mother's Day!

06:29.957 --> 06:31.058
You too!

06:31.091 --> 06:33.427
(laughing)
Oh... How sweet.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.129
(high-pitched):
Does anyone else see my
grandfather in that chair?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.033
I think I need something to eat.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.835
Is Nathan home yet?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.571
No. But I'm sure
he has all kinds of

06:43.604 --> 06:45.105
wonderful things planned,

06:45.138 --> 06:47.040
since forgetting Mother's Day
would be incredibly thoughtless,

06:47.074 --> 06:48.776
dare I say, unforgivable.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.211
(doorbell rings)

06:51.244 --> 06:54.114
I have a delivery
from Nathan Miller.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.883
Oh, come on!
Oh...!

06:55.916 --> 06:56.917
Those are for me.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.786
Come in. Come in.
Come in.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.988
Oh. I'm sorry.
I don't have a tip for you.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.123
I leave my wallet on my dresser
on Mother's Day.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.958
Oh. I know. Here...

07:04.992 --> 07:06.560
give these to your mother.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.662
Mm. Those are weeds.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.198
No, they're not.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.500
I'm a licensed florist.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.200
You're holding weeds.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.907
(phone chimes)

07:19.940 --> 07:23.043
That's weird.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.713
I just got a text saying that
my flower delivery's arrived.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.847
Probably for Mother's Day,
right?

07:26.880 --> 07:30.751
Today's Mother's Day?

07:30.784 --> 07:32.986
Oh, God. Oh, this is bad.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.187
This is very, very bad.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.189
Why? You just said you had
flowers delivered to your house.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.125
Yeah. I got a standing order
at McGee's Florist

07:38.158 --> 07:39.693
to automatically
deliver flowers

07:39.727 --> 07:41.194
and a personalized poem
every Mother's Day.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.531
One to my mother who used to
live in Myrtle Beach

07:43.564 --> 07:44.998
and the other to my house

07:45.032 --> 07:46.867
for my ex-mother-in-law.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.202
I forgot to change the order.
(gasps)

07:49.236 --> 07:52.239
My mother's got flowers,
but she's got the wrong poem.

07:52.272 --> 07:53.541
I got to get that card!

07:55.242 --> 07:58.746
Look who suddenly gets busy
on Moving Day!

08:00.781 --> 08:03.817
I want to wait for Nathan to get
home before I open the card,

08:03.851 --> 08:06.887
but I really want to read
this year's poem.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.121
No. I'll wait.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.824
But I have to read it.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.992
No, I'll wait.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.994
God! Just read
the damn card.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.262
(gasps, clears throat)

08:18.031 --> 08:18.799
(sighs)

08:18.832 --> 08:20.634
"A mother is a gift
from above.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.070
"Always there
with unconditional love.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.272
"Your cooking is delicious.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.140
"Your advice is judicious.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.643
"You simply have no flaw.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.178
"You're the perfect mother...

08:32.212 --> 08:34.281
"...in-law."

08:34.314 --> 08:35.549
I can explain.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.150
"Mother-in-law"?!

08:37.184 --> 08:38.151
Wait. Mom. Mom.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.119
These flowers aren't for you.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.621
They're for Natalie Durkess,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.856
Nathan's ex-wife's
mother, not you.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.658
Oh. What a turn of events.

08:44.692 --> 08:45.959
(panting)

08:45.993 --> 08:47.661
I have a standing order
at McGee's Florist.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.229
I pre-wrote a bunch of poems.

08:49.262 --> 08:52.700
I forgot to cancel Janice's
Mom's flowers after our divorce.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.968
I'm sure there's a huge bouquet
outside of your old house

08:55.002 --> 08:56.336
in Myrtle Beach.
(sighs)

08:56.369 --> 08:58.305
So, you forgot Mother's Day?

08:58.338 --> 09:01.975
No... the whole reason that I
set up the automatic delivery

09:02.009 --> 09:04.144
was so that
I would never forget.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.146
Or never have to remember.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.314
Well.
Maybe this is a good time

09:07.347 --> 09:08.782
for me to read my poem.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.084
"Mother, 'M' is for
the moments we've shared,

09:11.118 --> 09:12.085
"'O' is for--"

09:12.119 --> 09:13.220
Wait a second.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.823
Why were Natalie's flowers
delivered here?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.926
She used to spend
Mother's Day here.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.894
"'O' is for only
I remember..."

09:20.928 --> 09:22.262
While I was in Myrtle Beach,

09:22.295 --> 09:24.231
you were cheating on me
with another mother?!

09:26.800 --> 09:29.269
I do not miss that volume.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.237
Look, Mom, come on.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.139
I said I was sorry.

09:32.172 --> 09:35.843
Yeah, with the same mouth that's
been lying to me for 10 years.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.210
Oh, no.
She's coming in hot.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.946
Scramble!
Don't make eye contact.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.781
She'll see you as a threat.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.650
You forgot Mother's Day!

09:42.683 --> 09:45.986
The one day of the year
that I expect special treatment

09:46.019 --> 09:47.655
and you forgot it!

09:47.688 --> 09:49.957
"The one day" that you expect
special treatment?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.358
"The one day"?

09:51.391 --> 09:54.094
Every day since you've lived
here has been Mother's Day.

09:54.127 --> 09:55.162
Do you...

09:57.230 --> 10:00.734
Do you know what
being your child is like?

10:00.768 --> 10:01.969
It's like, it's like
the guy that runs

10:02.002 --> 10:03.236
the nuclear power plant.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.271
Every day,
you do a thousand things right,

10:04.304 --> 10:06.139
but you make one mistake

10:06.173 --> 10:07.875
and it's a complete
catastrophe.

10:07.908 --> 10:11.144
You know what
being your mother is like?

10:11.178 --> 10:13.113
Is like being the guy
in the power plant

10:13.146 --> 10:14.782
whose son is ungrateful.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.818
If you don't
want me around anymore,

10:17.851 --> 10:19.286
I think it's time that I move.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.021
Oh, come on.
We're doing this again?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.422
The "I'm moving out" show?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.423
It's not a show.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.357
I need the classifieds.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.226
Where's the newspaper?

10:26.259 --> 10:27.327
Where's the newspaper?

10:27.360 --> 10:27.961
Oh, no.
There's nowhere to scramble!

10:27.995 --> 10:30.698
Just make yourself small.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.833
Has anyone seen a newspaper?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.702
Looks like I'll be spending
this Mother's Day brunch

10:34.735 --> 10:36.336
looking for
a new place to live!

10:36.369 --> 10:38.405
You know what?
I'm not going to brunch.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.572
Okay. I-I-I'm-I'm sorry.

10:39.606 --> 10:42.109
I'm exhausted. I spent the
entire week living in a box,

10:42.142 --> 10:43.310
trying to get abducted,

10:43.343 --> 10:44.845
and the only good thing
that came out of it

10:44.878 --> 10:47.147
is that I now fit in my
skinny, skinny jeans.

10:48.882 --> 10:49.983
So...

10:50.017 --> 10:51.719
forgive me if
I don't want to go out

10:51.752 --> 10:54.287
so that you can
continue this show in public.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.990
Well, fine.
We'll just go without you.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.191
Debbie, let's go.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.127
Oh. No. No. No. No.
No. No. No.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.361
You barely looked at my flowers.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.930
You didn't listen to my poem.

11:02.963 --> 11:03.764
Do you know what?

11:03.797 --> 11:04.364
I give up my entire day

11:04.397 --> 11:05.365
to make Nathan look bad

11:05.398 --> 11:07.167
and you don't even care.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.068
So, you know what?

11:08.101 --> 11:09.302
Forget your Mother's Day.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.005
Motherless Day
is back on.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.440
Adam, take me
to my couch.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.009
Yes'm.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.081
Take it easy, Carol!

11:21.114 --> 11:22.750
They're my ride.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.417
Happy Mother's Day.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.186
Bye, Grandpa.

11:28.021 --> 11:31.191
Fine. Looks like
I'll be going to brunch alone.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.459
Sure you are.
You don't even drive.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.927
How you gonna get there?

11:33.961 --> 11:35.763
I'll walk.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.431
And everyone in Leesburg
will be pointing and saying,

11:38.465 --> 11:40.333
"What kind of son
would let his mother

11:40.367 --> 11:42.770
"trot along the highway
on Mother's Day?!"

11:45.873 --> 11:47.975
I'll be walking up
Maple Street to First.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.411
In case this information
becomes important to you

11:51.444 --> 11:52.479
five minutes from now.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.315
(door slams)

12:05.158 --> 12:07.260
Ma'am, I am sorry
to bother you again,

12:07.294 --> 12:08.361
but there are
other people waiting.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.063
And that gentleman has
low blood sugar.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.099
Are you sure
your family's coming?

12:12.132 --> 12:14.001
Don't worry. They'll be here.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.336
They just needed time to think.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.838
Here.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.111
How about this?
I'll speed things along a bit.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.413
I'll send my son a sad selfie.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.048
That's how I got him to
bring me a turkey sandwich

12:28.081 --> 12:29.416
in the bathtub.

12:31.451 --> 12:32.786
(phone chimes)

12:32.820 --> 12:36.323
(sighs, groans)

12:41.895 --> 12:43.396
(phone chimes)

12:45.498 --> 12:47.467
(sighs)

12:53.573 --> 12:55.175
Garçon.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.579
I found the
bottom of my glass again.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.550
I thought these, uh, mimosas
was supposed to be bottomless.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.819
Ma'am, it has been
another 20 minutes.

13:05.853 --> 13:06.519
Perhaps we could
move you to the bar

13:06.553 --> 13:07.988
until your family arrives.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.423
(slurring):
I'm... quite comfortable here.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.258
I see that.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.926
It's just that,
like many restaurants,

13:12.960 --> 13:14.461
we're in the business
of selling food.

13:14.494 --> 13:17.464
Fine. You want me to order?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.099
I'll order.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.468
My daughter
and her whole family will have

13:21.501 --> 13:23.871
whatever dumb
vegetarian thing you have.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.573
My, forever-dieting son
will have a salad.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.509
And my ex-husband loves
the baked halibut.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.244
So, give him the chicken.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.213
(laughing hysterically)

13:35.382 --> 13:36.449
(laughing):
"Give him the chicken!"

13:36.483 --> 13:38.551
(continues laughing)

13:38.585 --> 13:40.320
(incoherently slurring)

13:40.353 --> 13:41.488
(laughing)

13:43.556 --> 13:45.592
"He loves the halibut!"

13:45.625 --> 13:47.527
(laughing)

13:50.530 --> 13:51.731
Guys, we got to go.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.601
Mom's all alone at LaRosa's
and she just texted me a video

13:54.634 --> 13:57.437
of all the happy mothers
with their families.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.639
CAROL (over phone):
Happy mother.

13:59.672 --> 14:04.444
Happy mother.
Happy mother...

14:04.477 --> 14:06.446
(deep voice):
Your mother.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.449
I can't believe she went
there by herself.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.451
I can. It's so typical.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.186
It's just another one
of her guilt-trips.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.888
You can't give in
to this, Nathan.

14:14.922 --> 14:15.889
Be strong.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.124
Come join us on the couch,

14:17.157 --> 14:18.625
where we refuse
to feed the beast.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.327
Look, I, I hear
what you're saying, Debbie,

14:20.360 --> 14:21.661
but, I, I don't think that today
is the best day to,

14:21.694 --> 14:23.196
"starve the beast."

14:23.230 --> 14:24.497
It's her day. It's...

14:24.531 --> 14:25.865
well, it's Beast Day.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.169
So, it's the perfect day
to take a stand.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.270
She'll know you finally mean it.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.472
Unlike all the other times,
where you just give in.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.473
What you need to do,

14:33.506 --> 14:35.475
is ferberize her.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.077
"Ferberize"?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.146
Is that the thing on TV
that you hook to your vacuum

14:39.179 --> 14:40.480
to give yourself a haircut?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.982
No.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.251
Well, that's what
I vote we do, anyway.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.653
Hold her down and cut her hair
with a vacuum.

14:46.686 --> 14:47.520
(laughs)

14:47.554 --> 14:50.123
She'd hate that.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.525
Ferberizing is a method
to help babies go to sleep.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.995
See, instead of running
to them when they cry,

14:55.028 --> 14:57.197
you just let them cry until
they fall asleep on their own.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.631
I-I don't know.
That'd be so hard.

14:58.665 --> 14:59.799
I mean knowing that she's there
all upset, I--

14:59.832 --> 15:02.535
N-N-No one said it was gonna
be easy, Nathan. All right?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.504
When Mikayla used to cry,
I'd get so upset,

15:04.537 --> 15:07.140
that Debbie would have to
massage my earlobes.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.442
It creates a wonderfully
distracting tingle

15:09.476 --> 15:11.644
that you can feel
all the way down to your...

15:13.180 --> 15:15.182
...toes.

15:15.215 --> 15:18.051
Okay, so, so you're saying

15:18.085 --> 15:19.652
that by ignoring mom,

15:19.686 --> 15:21.454
it's not that we're
withholding love,

15:21.488 --> 15:23.991
it's that we're giving...
independence?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.625
Exactly.
Yes.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.527
Okay, yeah, I could do that.
I'm in.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.428
(phone chimes)
Oh...

15:31.464 --> 15:33.466
Aw, man, she's
holding a loaf of bread

15:33.500 --> 15:34.701
like it's a baby.

15:34.734 --> 15:35.402
What, what if we just...

15:35.435 --> 15:38.205
Oh, yeah. Yeah. That is tingly.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.140
(laughs, sighs)

15:40.173 --> 15:41.674
Nothing wrong with a guy
getting a little earlobe massage

15:41.708 --> 15:43.176
from his sister, right?
(laughs)

15:43.210 --> 15:44.311
It's me, Adam.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.678
Oh, God!

15:48.715 --> 15:50.617
Mmm... (slurping)

15:50.650 --> 15:52.085
Oh, damn it.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.621
(slurring):
My phone's dead.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.423
I must've took...

15:56.456 --> 15:58.391
too many pictures.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.595
Excuse me!
That's my pocketbook.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.631
Relax. I just need a phone
for two minutes.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.700
Why do you have a gun?

16:07.734 --> 16:09.036
Ma'am, ma'am.
Huh?

16:09.069 --> 16:10.703
You need to stay
at your own table.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.239
Oh, ho, ho.
And it may
be time

16:12.272 --> 16:13.373
for you to sit on your hands.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.374
(laughs)

16:14.407 --> 16:15.708
And we're gonna
need these chairs

16:15.742 --> 16:17.610
for patrons who have
actually shown up.
Ah, ah, ah.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.711
Not gonna happen.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.381
Ma'am, let go.
Nope.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.250
Ma'am, you are making a scene.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.484
You're making a scene!

16:24.517 --> 16:25.618
Fine!

16:29.622 --> 16:31.524
Ooh...

16:31.558 --> 16:33.360
That was wild.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.465
I'm still wet and cold.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.701
I'm sorry, but that's all the
coats we had in lost and found.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.670
Look, I know
I have a kind face,

16:43.703 --> 16:45.572
but I'm very close
to slapping you.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.641
I think it's time
for you to leave.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.210
Yeah, well,

16:50.243 --> 16:51.711
my family and I

16:51.744 --> 16:54.247
will never come in here again.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.583
Your family was never
here in the first place.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.285
(laughs)

16:58.318 --> 16:59.652
You're not gonna like this.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.656
My wallet stays on my dresser
on Mother's Day.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.691
(laughing)

17:05.725 --> 17:06.693
It doesn't matter.

17:06.726 --> 17:07.727
The-the meal is on the house.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.696
We just need you to go.
Now.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.799
First, I'll need you to wrap
all this stuff up to go.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.602
And if it doesn't live up to

17:15.635 --> 17:17.704
my high "cumilary" standards,

17:17.737 --> 17:19.772
I will certainly write

17:19.806 --> 17:24.444
an eloquent, albeit negative,
review on Yelp.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.516
(retching)

17:31.751 --> 17:33.753
I do not need
that boxed up.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.426
Tell me I have
to leave your restaurant?

17:39.459 --> 17:40.427
Me?

17:40.460 --> 17:41.761
Me?!

17:41.794 --> 17:44.264
What?!

17:44.297 --> 17:45.265
(sighs)

17:45.298 --> 17:46.266
It's my day.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.300
Kidding me?

17:47.334 --> 17:49.102
Ask me to leave
your restaurant,

17:49.136 --> 17:50.670
you big old show-off?

17:50.703 --> 17:52.772
This is my day.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.107
My day.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.675
(tires screech)

17:55.708 --> 17:57.677
What the...?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.712
(door slams, tires squeal)

18:04.551 --> 18:05.685
It's after midnight.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.187
Where could she be?

18:07.220 --> 18:08.788
Don't worry,
I'm sure she's fine.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.123
Sometimes she gets like this,

18:10.157 --> 18:11.624
but she always comes back.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.326
She's like a bitchy boomerang.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.665
I made it!

18:18.698 --> 18:19.666
Oh, my God.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.667
Mom, you're alive!

18:20.700 --> 18:21.834
Where were you?
What happened?

18:21.868 --> 18:23.770
It was crazy! Crazy!

18:23.803 --> 18:25.338
I was walking down
Sycamore Street...

18:25.372 --> 18:27.174
I guess I looked like
a homeless person,

18:27.207 --> 18:28.841
because some people
scooped me up in a van!

18:28.875 --> 18:30.277
Oh, my God, it's true!

18:30.310 --> 18:32.579
They were snatching up homeless!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.414
I'm too pretty
to pull off "homeless."

18:34.447 --> 18:36.216
Right.
Shut up, Nathan.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.484
Oh, yeah, you're right,
you're right.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.785
It's not about me,
it's about you.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.187
Yeah. Mom,
did they hurt you?
No.

18:40.220 --> 18:41.554
Actually, they
were very nice.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.789
They said they were just trying

18:42.822 --> 18:43.790
to clean up the neighborhood.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.292
I must've passed out in the van,

18:45.325 --> 18:46.726
'cause when I woke up,
it was dark outside

18:46.759 --> 18:48.161
and I was sleeping
in a Dumpster

18:48.195 --> 18:49.662
with a bum named Larry.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.532
He said
"bum" wasn't a very PC term,

18:52.565 --> 18:54.234
that he preferred
"urban outdoorsman,"

18:54.267 --> 18:55.802
but that he liked me

18:55.835 --> 18:58.137
and so he'd give me a pass
on the B-word.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.307
But... Mom...

19:00.340 --> 19:02.609
Okay, why didn't you
find a phone and call us?

19:02.642 --> 19:03.710
Because I was mad.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.812
So I ditched my heels,

19:05.845 --> 19:07.880
traded Larry a ten-minute
back rub for these boots,

19:07.914 --> 19:09.716
climbed out of
the Dumpster,

19:09.749 --> 19:12.885
headed south and hitchhiked
along 95!

19:12.919 --> 19:15.422
Wait... wait, you...
you hitchhiked?

19:15.455 --> 19:16.223
This is amazing.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.790
I know, right?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.392
I was picked up by a trucker.

19:19.426 --> 19:20.460
His name was Bucky.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.362
He gave me these energy drinks.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.664
They...

19:24.697 --> 19:26.299
they come in these
tiny little bottles

19:26.333 --> 19:27.300
and they're amazing.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.768
I could climb a tree right now.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.337
Who wants to climb a tree?

19:32.372 --> 19:33.706
Okay, Mom,
Mom, Mom...
Huh?

19:33.740 --> 19:34.741
Why don't you
just sit down?

19:34.774 --> 19:37.176
Dad, why don't you
get her some tea?
Yeah. Decaf.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.316
I'm so sorry that we left you
alone on Mother's Day.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.451
Well, you shouldn't be.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.919
I was so caught up
in my adventure,

19:46.953 --> 19:48.555
and trying to survive,

19:48.588 --> 19:50.323
that for the first time
in 43 years,

19:50.357 --> 19:51.924
I wasn't thinking
about being a mother

19:51.958 --> 19:54.427
and it was exhilarating!

19:54.461 --> 19:55.928
You had a motherless
Mother's Day.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.764
See, I told you it was great.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.765
You know what?

19:58.798 --> 19:59.832
It was.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.668
And Nathan...

20:01.701 --> 20:02.969
starting tomorrow,

20:03.002 --> 20:04.837
I'm gonna look for
a place of my own.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.306
And I mean it this time.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.774
Look, no, Mom,
you don't have to...

20:07.807 --> 20:09.809
Yes, I do.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.843
You know...

20:10.877 --> 20:12.979
I went from living
with your father

20:13.012 --> 20:15.315
and taking care
of him 24/7

20:15.348 --> 20:17.850
to coming up here
and doing the same for you.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.287
The time has come
to take care of me.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.355
And the only way
to do that is to...

20:22.389 --> 20:24.291
go out there on my own.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.826
So...

20:26.859 --> 20:28.461
I'm moving out.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.030
Wow.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.532
When you said,
"I'm moving out,"

20:32.565 --> 20:33.966
I thought I just
heard angels sing,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.935
but I...

20:39.339 --> 20:40.373
I'm kidding.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.608
I'm really proud of you, Mom.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.909
And I guess I gave you

20:42.942 --> 20:44.844
the best gift ever
by forgetting Mother's Day.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.846
(phone ringing)

20:46.879 --> 20:49.349
Who could be calling
here after midnight?

20:49.382 --> 20:50.917
Hello?

20:50.950 --> 20:52.719
Yeah, she's here.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.887
Ooh, I guess she did.

20:54.921 --> 20:55.955
I'll put her on.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.857
It's your mother.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.892
You forgot Mother's Day.

21:02.495 --> 21:05.298
Oh, crap.
I do this every year.
