WEBVTT

00:00.531 --> 00:07.007
в™Єв™Є

00:07.007 --> 00:11.011
OH.
CHECK OUT THESE POSEURS.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.715
"DUDE, HOW MUCH DO YOU LOVE
MY GRECO-ROMAN SANDALS

00:14.715 --> 00:17.118
"AND SUPER-GROOMED SIDEBURNS?

00:17.118 --> 00:19.090
I CALL THEM
MY DOUCHE-BURNS."

00:19.090 --> 00:21.622
"DID YOU SEE
MY GIANT LEATHER MAN-BRACELET?

00:21.622 --> 00:24.195
"I GOT IT BECAUSE
MY VEST WITH NO SHIRT

00:24.195 --> 00:27.098
"JUST NEEDED A LITTLE SOMETHIN'.
AND LET'S HIGH-FIVE.

00:27.098 --> 00:28.729
YEAH! WE DID IT!"

00:28.729 --> 00:30.661
OKAY, IT'S 6:00.
I'M HEADING HOME.

00:30.661 --> 00:33.804
NO, WAIT. YOU CAN'T QUIT.
I SAID THE LAST MEAN THING.

00:33.804 --> 00:35.306
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS!

00:35.306 --> 00:39.140
THAT'S WHY I DON'T PLAY
UGLY BABY WITH YOU ANYMORE.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.142
NOW I'M JUST GONNA SPIRAL
ALL DAY

00:41.142 --> 00:42.543
BECAUSE
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON.

00:42.543 --> 00:46.147
WELL, THAT'S YOUR INSANE CROSS
TO BEAR. COME ON. LET'S GO.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.449
OH, SO MUCH WORK
TO DO AT HOME.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.451
OH, WE HAVE AN EARLY SHOWING
TOMORROW,

00:50.451 --> 00:53.454
SO PICK ME UP AT 8:00,
NOT 8-ISH, NOT 8-ADJACENT.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.157
AND CALLING ME AT 8:00
FROM 20 MINUTES AWAY

00:56.157 --> 00:58.459
SAYING, "COME OUT. I'M HERE"
ALSO DOESN'T COUNT.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.161
YOU HAVE A LOT OF RULES.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.133
HI.
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

01:02.133 --> 01:03.794
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
TELLING YOU WHY,

01:03.794 --> 01:06.537
BUT I JUST NEED TO PUT IT
OUT THERE, OKAY?

01:06.537 --> 01:09.270
AND THAT'S A GREAT BRACELET,
BY THE WAY. BYE.

01:09.270 --> 01:12.773
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
THAT WAS YOUR FAULT.
(chuckles)

01:12.773 --> 01:15.206
I KNOW YOU LIKE MOVING
THOSE HIPS, SHEILA,

01:15.206 --> 01:17.708
SO PUT THAT TORQUE
IN YOUR SWING, OKAY?

01:17.708 --> 01:19.210
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

01:20.711 --> 01:23.854
SINCE YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH HER,
DOES SHE PAY YOU MORE?

01:23.854 --> 01:27.158
NO.

01:27.158 --> 01:29.220
OH, DON'T GET DOWN.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.722
SHE PROBABLY BOUGHT YOU LUNCH
OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?
GOT ME A LARGE ROOT BEER, BABY.

01:31.722 --> 01:34.365
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
WHERE'S TRAVIS?
(sips)

01:34.365 --> 01:36.367
HE'S IN THE CLUBHOUSE
WITH THE BOYS--

01:36.367 --> 01:38.469
SHEPP, DONNIE,
BITCH-SLAP HARRIS.

01:38.469 --> 01:41.702
T-MAN, YOUR RIDE'S HERE.

01:41.702 --> 01:45.436
HEY, MOM, LOOK. LOOK WHAT DONNIE
DREW. HE'S A TATTOO ARTIST.

01:45.436 --> 01:49.840
HE MOSTLY DRAWS SNAKES DOING
HORRIBLE THINGS TO NAKED CHICKS.
AW.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.144
ALTHOUGH, THIS--
THIS LOOKS CONSENSUAL.
SHE DOESN'T LOOK HAPPY,
TRAVIS.

01:53.144 --> 01:55.746
GOOD TO SEE YOU, DONNIE,
SHEPP, CARL.

01:55.746 --> 01:59.220
JULES, YOU KNOW YOU CAN
CALL ME BITCH-SLAP.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.591
I'M CHOOSING NOT TO.

02:02.593 --> 02:05.526
TRAVIS, I JUST WANNA TALK
TO YOUR DAD FOR A SECOND.

02:05.526 --> 02:06.627
OH, MAN.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.200
UH-OH, SHE'S GOT
THE FAKE SMILE FACE.

02:09.200 --> 02:13.204
WHAT FAKE SMILE? THIS ISN'T
A FAKE SMILE. I'M JUST HAPPY.

02:13.204 --> 02:15.236
ALL RIGHT, COBB,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.209
I KNOW. YOU THINK THE FELLAS
ARE A BAD INFLUENCE ON TRAVIS.

02:18.209 --> 02:20.341
BUT IT TURNS OUT,
HE'S A GOOD INFLUENCE ON THEM.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.373
NORMALLY,
THEY'RE DRUNK BY NOW.

02:22.373 --> 02:25.346
BOBBY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WASTING YOUR TIME IN THERE?

02:25.346 --> 02:27.578
YOU WERE A PRO GOLFER...
SORT OF.

02:27.578 --> 02:29.380
YOUR LESSONS
ARE STARTING TO PICK UP.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.151
FREE ROOT BEERS
ARE ROLLING IN.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.924
IF YOU JUST WORKED HARD,
YOU COULD GO FROM BEING THE GUY

02:33.924 --> 02:35.926
THAT WORKS PART-TIME
AT A PUBLIC COURSE

02:35.926 --> 02:37.928
TO THE HEAD PRO
AT THE COUNTRY CLUB.

02:37.928 --> 02:39.690
THIS IS MY KINGDOM, J-BIRD.

02:39.690 --> 02:43.163
I MEAN,
LOOK AT THIS PLAQUE OVER HERE.
OH, GOD, NOT THE PLAQUE.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.637
CAN WE JUST ONCE NOT
TALK ABOUT THE PLAQUE?
THEY PUT THIS UP
WHEN I SHOT THE COURSE RECORD.

02:46.637 --> 02:48.639
AND WE'RE OFF.

02:48.639 --> 02:50.941
ROBERT "BOBBY" COBB.
PEOPLE SEE THIS, JULES,

02:50.941 --> 02:52.803
AND THEY RESPECT IT.

02:52.803 --> 02:55.576
(man) HEY, CHAMP!
EXCUSE ME.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.708
WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR, BUD?

02:57.708 --> 02:59.810
GOOD BOY, CHAMP.
GOOD BOY, CHAMP.

02:59.810 --> 03:01.312
SUCH A GOOD CHAMP.

03:01.312 --> 03:03.484
OH.

03:03.484 --> 03:06.487
IT SUCKS YOU'RE SO TIRED.
WHY DO YOU WORK SO HARD?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.489
I REALLY WANNA SEE YOU TONIGHT.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.291
Me, too.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.294
SO... WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

03:13.294 --> 03:15.326
I'M IN BED, JOSH,
SO THE USUAL.

03:15.326 --> 03:20.471
I'VE GOT ON A TINY PINK
SEE-THROUGH NIGHTIE.

03:20.471 --> 03:25.576
I'M WEARING MATCHING UNDERWEAR
WITH TINY BOWS ON THE SIDE.

03:25.576 --> 03:30.481
ONE TUG MAKES THEM FALL...
RIGHT... OFF.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.943
I COULD BE THERE
IN FIVE MINUTES.

03:32.943 --> 03:35.616
(mouth full)
OH, SWEETIE, I'M JUST TOO TIRED.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.688
I'M SORRY. GOOD NIGHT.

03:37.688 --> 03:38.989
(beep)

03:41.221 --> 03:42.793
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BOY TOY
LAST NIGHT?

03:42.793 --> 03:45.326
OH, I KNEW I HAD TO WORK EARLY
SO I BLEW HIM OFF,

03:45.326 --> 03:47.858
WHICH WAS SO DUMB,
BECAUSE I STAYED UP TILL 1:00

03:47.858 --> 03:49.900
WATCHING THIS INFOMERCIAL
ABOUT THIS CREAM

03:49.900 --> 03:53.264
THAT MAKES YOUR BREASTS FIRMER.
DON'T WORRY. I GOT YOU ONE, TOO.

03:53.264 --> 03:55.606
THANKS, BUT I GOT UP EARLY
'CAUSE I THOUGHT

03:55.606 --> 03:57.738
I WAS GONNA GET A SEX STORY.
NO.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.970
NO MORE BLOWING OFF FUN STUFF
FOR WORK. THAT'S INSANE.

03:59.970 --> 04:03.013
OH, AND I SWEAR, IF YOU DON'T
STOP WITH THE HAZELNUT,

04:03.013 --> 04:05.946
I'M GONNA START MAKING
MY OWN COFFEE.
NO, YOU WON'T.

04:05.946 --> 04:09.780
YOU'RE RIGHT. I WON'T. EVEN
SAYING IT WAS TOO MUCH WORK.
8:00. WHERE IS LAURIE?

04:09.780 --> 04:12.853
(speed-dialing)
WELL, IF I'M GUESSING, SHE'S
PASSED OUT UNDER SOME LOSER

04:12.853 --> 04:15.826
WHO'S NAKED EXCEPT
FOR HIS HAT ON BACKWARDS.

04:15.826 --> 04:18.759
CHARMING. HEY, LAURIE,
IT'S 8:00. WHERE ARE YOU?

04:18.759 --> 04:21.562
I'M PULLING UP.
COME OUTSIDE.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.595
OKAY, I'M OUTSIDE.
YOU'RE NOT HERE.

04:24.595 --> 04:26.567
I AM. YOU JUST CAN'T SEE ME.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.539
Give me two minutes.
(beep)

04:28.539 --> 04:31.041
HEY, PAPER BUDDY,
DO YOU GOLF?

04:31.041 --> 04:33.704
OH, GOOD. WE'RE PLAYING
THE OBVIOUS QUESTION GAME.

04:33.704 --> 04:36.747
I'M GREAT AT THIS.
DO YOU EVER WEAR WHITE DRESSES?

04:36.747 --> 04:38.749
SERIOUSLY, DO YOU GOLF
WITH OTHER GUYS?

04:38.749 --> 04:40.911
DO YOU EVER CARRY FOLDERS
RIGHT HERE?

04:40.911 --> 04:43.714
(horn honks, tires screech)
HI.

04:43.714 --> 04:47.458
YOU KNOW, DON'T SAY "HI" TO ME.
I'M MAD AT YOU.
(whirring)

04:47.458 --> 04:49.890
LOOK, I THINK IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR MY EX-HUSBAND

04:49.890 --> 04:52.292
TO MAKE SOME NEW FRIENDS,

04:52.292 --> 04:54.425
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD
FOR YOU TO, WELL, HAVE A FRIEND.
(pop music playing on radio)

04:54.425 --> 04:57.928
NO, NO, NO RADIO.
(mouths words)

04:57.928 --> 05:01.031
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO,
LAURIE! YOU'RE BEING PUNISHED!

05:01.031 --> 05:02.473
(music stops)

05:02.473 --> 05:04.605
ANYWAY, YOU AND BOBBY
SHOULD PLAY GOLF.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.638
OH, WELL, I'M CURRENTLY
NOT LOOKING TO GET SET UP

05:07.638 --> 05:10.681
ON A PLAYDATE.
ALL RIGHT, NORMALLY,
I'D LISTEN TO YOUR BLAH-BLAH,

05:10.681 --> 05:13.684
BUT RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO GO SHOW
A HOUSE. SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

05:13.684 --> 05:16.687
BOBBY'S A GOOD GUY. YOU CAN
EITHER PLAY GOLF WITH HIM NOW

05:16.687 --> 05:18.989
OR YOU CAN PLAY WITH HIM
THREE WEEKS FROM NOW

05:18.989 --> 05:21.021
AFTER I'VE SPENT
ALL THIS TIME COMING OVER HERE

05:21.021 --> 05:24.024
JUST GRINDING YOU DOWN AND BY
TALKING AND TALKING AND TALKING.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.357
AND YOU WONDER IF I'LL EVER NEED
TO TAKE A BREATH, BUT I WON'T,

05:26.357 --> 05:27.958
'CAUSE I WAS A SWIMMER
IN HIGH SCHOOL AND I'LL JUST

05:27.958 --> 05:30.100
TALK AND TALK AND TALK AND TALK
AND TALK AND TALK AND TALK--
FINE.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.933
(inhales deeply) THANK GOD.
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA PASS OUT.
NOW YOU'RE MAKING US LATE.

05:32.933 --> 05:37.438
ARE YOU DRIVING IN YOUR PANTIES?
I WAS AIR-DRYING MY SKIRT,
AND IT GOT AWAY FROM ME.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.410
YOU MADE ME RUSH.

05:39.410 --> 05:40.911
OH, DEAR LORD.

05:43.714 --> 05:46.717
YES! I GOT IT! I GOT IT!
THAT WAS AWESOME!

05:46.717 --> 05:49.019
YOU DON'T GET TO CELEBRATE.
I'M STILL MAD.

05:49.019 --> 05:51.722
ALL RIGHT, I'M OVER IT.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

05:51.722 --> 05:52.953
YOU ROCK!

05:52.953 --> 05:55.085
(both) WHOO!

06:01.962 --> 06:03.964
OF COURSE
LAURIE WAS LATE AGAIN.

06:03.964 --> 06:06.837
SHE'S A SLAGGY, DUMB-ASS
TOWNIE.

06:06.837 --> 06:09.039
YOU ARE
A VERY ANGRY PERSON.

06:09.039 --> 06:10.941
YOU CHOSE TO BE HERE.
STOP IT.

06:10.941 --> 06:14.605
I WANTED TO SEE THE OUTFIT I GOT
HER FOR HER FIRST OPEN HOUSE.

06:14.605 --> 06:16.407
в™Є TA-DA в™Є

06:16.407 --> 06:20.050
OH, MY GOD. YOU LOOK AMAZING.
REALLY, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU.

06:20.050 --> 06:22.012
STOP. DON'T MAKE ME CRY.

06:22.012 --> 06:25.115
SO DUMMY SCREWS UP AGAIN
AND SHE GETS REWARDED?

06:25.115 --> 06:27.117
ELLIE, I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
WORKING,

06:27.117 --> 06:29.620
I'M TOO TIRED TO EVEN SEE JOSH.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.423
SO LAURIE'S GONNA TAKE OVER
SOME OF MY WORKLOAD.

06:32.423 --> 06:35.726
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAID
MAKE MORE TIME FOR FUN.

06:35.726 --> 06:38.969
AW, THANKS FOR MY PROMOTION,
ELLIE. SO SWEET OF YOU.

06:38.969 --> 06:42.072
ALL RIGHT, DO ME A FAVOR.
GIVE US A JUMP.

06:44.034 --> 06:45.436
(both) WHOA!

06:45.436 --> 06:47.978
OKAY. CLEARLY,
THE BRA'S NOT WORKING.

06:47.978 --> 06:49.540
YOU'RE SELLING REAL ESTATE.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.012
YOU WANT A LITTLE JIGGLE
FOR THE HUSBAND, SURE,

06:52.012 --> 06:55.516
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TOO MUCH
FOR THE WIFE.
I COULD DUCT-TAPE
THESE BAD BOYS,

06:55.516 --> 06:58.549
AND THERE'D STILL BE
TOO MUCH JIGGLE.
(gags) STUPID HAZELNUT.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.891
OH, THERE YOU GO.
HERE, PROBLEM SOLVED.
(coffee pours)

07:00.891 --> 07:03.494
YOU'RE MEAN.
I'LL GET OVER IT.

07:03.494 --> 07:05.796
OKAY, HERE'S THE KIND OF BRA
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

07:05.796 --> 07:08.459
SEE? POW!
CHECK OUT THE SUPPORT.

07:08.459 --> 07:11.962
OH, HEY, TRAV.
SHIRT DOWN, THEN "HEY, TRAV."

07:11.962 --> 07:13.464
SORRY. HEY, TRAV.

07:13.464 --> 07:15.806
TOO LATE. SCARRED FOR LIFE.

07:15.806 --> 07:18.108
OH, CALM DOWN.
THESE USED TO FEED YOU.

07:18.108 --> 07:20.811
(chuckles)
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO CHANGE.

07:20.811 --> 07:23.013
I FEEL CREEPY
WITH MY KNEES COVERED.

07:23.013 --> 07:25.015
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:25.015 --> 07:27.177
SHE'S THE WORLD'S
WORST ASSISTANT.

07:27.177 --> 07:30.180
NO, SHE'S NOT. SHE JUST NEEDS
SOMEONE TO BELIEVE IN HER.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.182
SHE'S PROBABLY BORED
ANSWERING PHONES.

07:32.182 --> 07:34.184
SHE'S LIKE THOSE KIDS
IN SCHOOL THAT--

07:34.184 --> 07:36.957
THAT GET F's BECAUSE
THEY'RE JUST NOT CHALLENGED.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.790
SOMETIMES KIDS GET F's
BECAUSE THEY'RE STUPID.
(coffee pours)

07:39.790 --> 07:41.792
STOP DOING THAT.
STOP TALKING.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.193
WHAT--
(stammers) NO, NOPE.

07:44.595 --> 07:47.097
THERE HE IS--
GRAYSON, THE SON OF GRAY.

07:47.097 --> 07:49.099
MIND IF I CALL YOU "G-MAN"?

07:49.099 --> 07:51.041
I DO, VERY MUCH.

07:51.041 --> 07:53.704
BRR. NO, I GET IT.
WE HARDLY KNOW EACH OTHER,

07:53.704 --> 07:56.006
BUT THAT'S THE BEAUTIFUL THING
ABOUT GOLF, G-MAN.

07:56.006 --> 07:58.709
YOU CAN SWING STICKS
WITH JUST ABOUT ANYBODY.

07:58.709 --> 08:02.112
I ONCE GOLFED WITH THIS DUDE
WHO GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL

08:02.112 --> 08:04.114
WITH A FRACTURED SKULL,
AND HE HAD ONE OF THOSE

08:04.114 --> 08:06.617
GIANT METAL HALO-LOOKING THINGS
SCREWED TO HIS HEAD.

08:06.617 --> 08:09.489
I KID YOU NOT. THAT THING
MUST HAVE WEIGHED 40 POUNDS.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.491
HE COLLAPSED
ON THE THIRD GREEN.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.163
HOT DAY. VERY HOT DAY.

08:13.163 --> 08:15.826
SO YOU AND JULES
BOTH LIKE TO CHAT.

08:15.826 --> 08:17.768
(loud whack)

08:17.768 --> 08:19.169
OHH!

08:19.169 --> 08:22.132
BOO-YAH! THAT THING'S
NOT COMING DOWN FOR A WHILE

08:22.132 --> 08:24.935
IF YOU WANNA GO CATCH
A MOVIE OR SOMETHIN'.

08:24.935 --> 08:26.937
SWEET SHOT, STUD.
I'LL GO SPOT IT!

08:26.937 --> 08:29.109
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

08:29.109 --> 08:30.581
OH, ANDY DON'T GOLF.

08:30.581 --> 08:33.013
HE JUST COMES OUT HERE
TO CHEER ME ON

08:33.013 --> 08:35.015
AND, UM, BEVERAGE ME
AND WHATNOT.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.516
JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER.

08:38.689 --> 08:40.691
NOW STAGING AN OPEN HOUSE

08:40.691 --> 08:42.693
IS ALL ABOUT
MAKING IT FEEL COMFORTABLE.

08:42.693 --> 08:46.727
LITTLE TIP--YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MANY BOWLS OF WOODEN FRUIT.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.800
WHY DOES THAT WORK?
NOBODY KNOWS. IT JUST DOES.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.563
OKAY, I'M GONNA PUT THIS BOWL
RIGHT HERE.

08:52.563 --> 08:56.206
JULES, GO! HAVE FUN WITH JOSH.
I CAN DO THIS.

08:56.206 --> 08:58.769
OF COURSE YOU CAN.
NOW BYE, SWEETIE.
OKAY.

08:58.769 --> 09:00.140
(door opens)
NOT THERE!

09:00.140 --> 09:01.642
GO!

09:01.642 --> 09:06.146
YOU LOOK JUST AS AMAZING
AS I'VE IMAGINED...

09:06.146 --> 09:08.819
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

09:08.819 --> 09:10.080
(growls) OH, GOD.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.123
(giggles) THAT WAS SO SEXY,
I MADE A WEIRD NOISE.

09:15.085 --> 09:19.590
OH, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

09:19.590 --> 09:21.161
WHAT'S WITH
THE GRANDMA HAND-PAT?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.193
I'M JUST NOT BIG
ON P.D.A.

09:23.193 --> 09:26.597
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE EMBARRASSED
BY ME OR SOMETHING.

09:26.597 --> 09:28.568
NO! JOSH, THIS IS MY CRAZY.
UNH-UNH.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.771
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE IT BETTER?

09:30.771 --> 09:34.044
KISS ME, RIGHT HERE
IN FRONT OF GOD AND EVERYONE.

09:34.044 --> 09:36.206
I'M NOT GONNA KISS
IN FRONT OF GOD.

09:36.206 --> 09:39.079
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
GIVE ME A SEC.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.581
WHAT DO I THINK?
YOU THINK
YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN,

09:41.581 --> 09:44.084
AND YOU CAN KISS
WHOEVER YOU WANNA KISS.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.056
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU THINK,
JULES.

09:46.056 --> 09:50.090
TONE THAT BOY DOWN.
HE'S HOT!

09:50.090 --> 09:52.062
THAT IS
ANOTHER VERY VALID POINT.

09:52.062 --> 09:54.194
NEZZIE, GET OFF THE SOFA.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.728
YOU'RE GETTING BODY GLITTER
ON THE PILLOWS.
IGNORING THAT. HOW'S IT COMING?

09:57.728 --> 09:59.029
I THINK I'M DONE.

09:59.029 --> 10:03.003
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO
WHEN I THINK I'M DONE?
LEAVE?

10:03.003 --> 10:05.976
NO. I SIT THERE FOR ANOTHER HOUR
AND I JUST SOAK UP THE VIBE.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.978
SOMETIMES YOU COME UP
WITH A SPECIAL TOUCH

10:07.978 --> 10:10.210
THAT JUST TAKES IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.043
VIBE-SOAKING,
SPECIAL TOUCH. GOT IT.
(beep)

10:13.043 --> 10:15.285
COME ON. DALE'S BARBECUE
STARTED OVER AN HOUR AGO.

10:15.285 --> 10:17.317
DON'T YOU WANNA GO?
OF COURSE I DO.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.990
OKAY, DO YOU REMEMBER CHRISSY,
THAT SKANK DALE HOOKED UP WITH,

10:19.990 --> 10:22.192
LIKE, FOUR YEARS AGO
WHEN WE WERE BROKEN UP?

10:22.192 --> 10:24.124
WELL, SHE'S BACK
FROM AFGHANISTAN,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.827
AND I'M GONNA KICK HER ASS
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.129
THAT'S WHY I GOT
MY FIGHTIN' NAILS ON.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.803
NEVER FORGET, NEZZIE.
YOU NEVER FORGET.

10:32.803 --> 10:33.804
UHH!

10:33.804 --> 10:37.107
LET'S HIT IT.

10:37.107 --> 10:40.040
YOU REMIND ME
OF THE STATUE OF DAVID.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.713
HE'S NUDE. (laughs)

10:42.713 --> 10:44.915
BARB! WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

10:44.915 --> 10:47.918
OH, KITTEN, DON'T YOU KNOW
YOU SHOULD NEVER LEAVE

10:47.918 --> 10:50.921
YOUR LUGGAGE UNATTENDED?
ALL RIGHT, KEEP IT MOVING.

10:50.921 --> 10:54.184
OKAY, LET'S JUST TRY
TO SHAKE THAT OFF.
I CAN'T.

10:54.184 --> 10:56.156
ALL RIGHT,
THE PUBLIC KISS.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.158
I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME SOUL SEARCHING,

10:58.158 --> 11:01.091
AND I AM IN.
GREAT.

11:01.091 --> 11:05.235
BUT FIRST, CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THE WAY YOU KISS?
SAY WHAT NOW?

11:05.235 --> 11:07.898
YOU OPEN THE DOOR
BY BRINGING UP THE KISSING,

11:07.898 --> 11:10.200
AND, WELL, HONESTLY,
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK MY WAY

11:10.200 --> 11:13.103
INTO THAT CONVERSATION
FOR DAYS.
HUH. GOOD.

11:13.103 --> 11:16.947
YOU ARE FANTASTIC ON THE NECK.
SERIOUSLY, KUDOS.

11:16.947 --> 11:19.009
HOWEVER...

11:19.009 --> 11:21.712
ALL RIGHT.
(crunches, blows)

11:21.712 --> 11:23.814
PRETEND THIS IS MY MOUTH,
OKAY?

11:23.814 --> 11:25.786
AND YOU WANNA USE
LESS TONGUE.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.058
YOU'RE NOT A COW
AT A SALT LICK. (grunts)

11:28.058 --> 11:31.261
YOU KNOW, THAT'S JUST SO SLOPPY.
NO ONE WANTS THAT.

11:31.261 --> 11:35.065
NOW PRETEND THAT YOU'RE
A CURIOUS LITTLE GARDEN SNAKE.

11:35.065 --> 11:37.968
(grunts)

11:37.968 --> 11:40.100
I GOT THIS. I GOT THIS.
OKAY.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.172
AHEM.

11:42.172 --> 11:46.006
OKAY. AND YOUR TONGUE
PEEKS IN... GETS SPOOKED

11:46.006 --> 11:48.108
AND THEN IT'S OUT.
THAT'S IT.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.911
OKAY, NOW WORK THAT TONGUE.
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO COW.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.943
LITTLE GARDEN SNAKE.
LITTLE SNAKE.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.485
WORK IT.
OH, THERE YOU GO. OKAY.

11:55.485 --> 11:56.486
HI, MOM.

11:56.486 --> 11:57.888
HI, TRAVIS!

11:57.888 --> 12:02.292
MY GOODNESS,
THIS IS MY FRIEND JOSH.

12:02.292 --> 12:03.894
HE EATS WEIRD.

12:03.894 --> 12:05.495
(chuckles) HE DOES.

12:05.495 --> 12:08.128
ANYWAY, JUST SAW YOU,
WANTED TO SAY HI.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.131
UH, BUT NOW I DON'T.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.463
DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.
WHAT? INTERRUPT WHAT?

12:13.463 --> 12:14.835
(Jules) TRAVIS?

12:14.835 --> 12:18.168
BYE, MOM. GOOD LUCK
WITH THAT APPLE, JOSH.

12:18.168 --> 12:21.211
(sighs)

12:21.211 --> 12:22.512
(loud whack)

12:22.512 --> 12:25.145
KA-BOOM! OH, ELLIE HATES IT
WHEN I HANG WITH BOBBY,

12:25.145 --> 12:27.417
SO DO ME A SOLID
AND DON'T MENTION THIS

12:27.417 --> 12:31.121
NEXT TIME YOU TALK TO HER.
THE ONLY TIME I EVER
SPOKE TO YOUR WIFE,

12:31.121 --> 12:33.123
SHE TOLD ME SHE'D--
AND I QUOTE--

12:33.123 --> 12:35.055
PAY SOMEONE TO DO ME
PRISON STYLE

12:35.055 --> 12:38.388
IF I DIDN'T BRING
MY TRASH CANS IN.
SO WE'RE COOL.

12:38.388 --> 12:41.391
I AM. YOU'RE MARRIED
TO A SCARY PERSON.
(exhales deeply)

12:41.391 --> 12:44.164
WHOA, SOMETHING'S HINKY
WITH YOUR SWING.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.498
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M MAKING MAGIC,
TRUST ME.

12:48.498 --> 12:54.074
MAN, YOU SMELL NICE.
KIDDING.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.346
ALL RIGHT. USE THAT STANCE.

12:56.346 --> 12:58.348
(whack)

12:58.348 --> 13:00.310
WHOO!
WOW.

13:00.310 --> 13:04.014
THANKS, MAN. YOU GONNA GO
SPOT MY SHOT?

13:04.014 --> 13:06.416
I'M NOT YOUR BITCH.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.290
(sighs) AND REGROUPED.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.992
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.294
SERIOUSLY?
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES.

13:16.226 --> 13:18.198
(whispering) ALL RIGHT,
JUST A LITTLE SNAKE.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.900
JUST A LITTLE SNAKE.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.501
(cell phone rings)

13:21.501 --> 13:24.474
I WENT TO A PARTY
AND I GOT A BLOODY NOSE.

13:24.474 --> 13:26.336
WHAT? HOW?

13:26.336 --> 13:28.338
WELL, I UNDERESTIMATED
THE FIGHTING SKILLS

13:28.338 --> 13:31.011
OF ONE OF OUR NATION'S
FINEST SOLDIERS.

13:31.011 --> 13:34.284
BUT I PICKED MYSELF UP
AND I WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE,

13:34.284 --> 13:36.286
YOU KNOW,
JUST TO SPECIAL-TOUCH IT.

13:36.286 --> 13:39.289
JULES, I DID NOT KNOW
THAT THEIR SON WOULD BE HERE.

13:39.289 --> 13:41.291
SOMEONE REALLY NEEDS
TO TELL THAT KID

13:41.291 --> 13:43.493
NOT TO SNEAK UP
BEHIND PEOPLE.

13:43.493 --> 13:46.026
HOW BAD IS IT?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.327
IT'S NOT GOOD.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.470
I'M SO SORRY.
I GOT YOU A TREAT.

14:00.470 --> 14:03.143
DO YOU THINK A PASTRY
IS GONNA MAKE UP

14:03.143 --> 14:05.445
FOR RUINING MY ONE DAY OFF
WITH JOSH?

14:05.445 --> 14:09.019
BECAUSE IT'S NOT!
IS THAT A CRANBERRY SCONE?

14:09.019 --> 14:12.052
OKAY, I'M FISHING THAT OUT ONLY
BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING ELSE

14:12.052 --> 14:15.425
IN THE TRASH CAN EXCEPT FOR GUM,
AND THAT WAS MINE.
JULES, I CAN EXPLAIN.

14:15.425 --> 14:18.588
YOU BEAT THEIR SON'S FACE IN
WITH A WOODEN BANANA!

14:18.588 --> 14:20.590
I THOUGHT
HE WAS AN INTRUDER!

14:20.590 --> 14:23.293
AND I ALREADY USED
ALL MY PEPPER SPRAY

14:23.293 --> 14:25.565
ON MY NEIGHBOR'S STUPID CAT.
WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?

14:25.565 --> 14:27.297
THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT.

14:27.297 --> 14:30.200
LOOK, I DID A GREAT JOB
STAGING THAT HOUSE.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.273
I JUST WENT BACK
TO ADD THE FLOWERS BECAUSE--
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND I.

14:33.273 --> 14:37.077
I WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT
UNLESS THE JOB WAS FINISHED.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.378
THAT IS SO UNFAIR!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.350
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:40.350 --> 14:43.283
I BOUGHT AN UGLY, NO-JIGGLE BRA,
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.986
I WAS GONNA TAKE IT OFF
AND THROW IT AT YOU,

14:45.986 --> 14:49.219
BUT IT HAS, LIKE, 20 HOOKS,
SO JUST FORGET IT!
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME!

14:49.219 --> 14:51.191
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING?
DID I MISS IT?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.323
SHE LOOKED DEVASTATED.
TELL ME EVERYTHING!

14:55.065 --> 14:57.227
NEED ONE!

14:59.229 --> 15:01.301
THAT'S
A PRETTY GREAT SERVICE.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.303
THANKS. HEY,
YOU DO REALLY SMELL NICE.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.506
YEAH? NEW COLOGNE.
I WASN'T SURE.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.239
NAH, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S MUSKY.

15:09.239 --> 15:11.641
ALL RIGHT, GO SINK THIS.

15:11.641 --> 15:13.643
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:13.643 --> 15:16.586
IF HE SINKS THIS, HE'S GONNA
BREAK YOUR COURSE RECORD.
REALLY?

15:18.688 --> 15:22.052
NOONAN! BAH!

15:22.052 --> 15:23.253
DISTRACTION!

15:23.253 --> 15:24.254
REALLY?

15:24.254 --> 15:26.126
NO MORE.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.698
ALL RIGHT, GO ON, G-MAN.
DRAIN IT.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.204
NO! (cries)

15:34.204 --> 15:36.166
YES!

15:36.166 --> 15:37.337
NICE ROUND.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.009
THANK YOU.

15:39.009 --> 15:42.012
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH

15:42.012 --> 15:46.476
HIS SELF-ESTEEM IS TIED
TO THAT STUPID RECORD?
RELAX, BANANA PANTS.
HE WAS JUST FINE.

15:48.678 --> 15:50.680
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

15:50.680 --> 15:52.352
(chirps)

15:52.352 --> 15:55.025
(spits)

15:55.025 --> 15:58.258
OKAY, THANKS TO DUMMY HERE,
WE HAVE A FAMILY CRISIS.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.131
BOBBY'S BEST QUALITY
IS THAT HE'S ALWAYS UPBEAT--

16:01.131 --> 16:03.433
MR. SUNSHINE, BUT LET'S ALL
REMEMBER THOSE RARE TIMES

16:03.433 --> 16:05.965
WHEN HE WAS DEPRESSED.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.238
LIKE THAT TIME HE TRIED
TO KARATE CHOP A COCONUT,

16:08.238 --> 16:11.141
AND HE COULDN'T PLAY GOLF
FOR THREE MONTHS?
EXACTLY.

16:11.141 --> 16:14.104
I THINK WE'VE ALL HAD THOSE
LATE-NIGHT HEART-TO-HEARTS

16:14.104 --> 16:17.277
WITH A DRUNK, CRYING MAN
IN HIS UNDERWEAR.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.379
THAT'S NOT FUN! THAT TRAIN'S
COMING BACK, PEOPLE.

16:19.379 --> 16:23.283
SO I PUT OUT SOME FOOD,
BUT THIS THING SNUCK UP ON ME,

16:23.283 --> 16:25.255
SO ALL I HAD
ARE SOME OLD CARROTS,

16:25.255 --> 16:26.586
SOME WHOLE WHEAT WAFFLES
AND A BRICK OF PEPPER JACK.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.289
I'LL SPLIT A WAFFLE
WITH SOMEONE.
YES, PLEASE.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.391
(baby crying)
YOU SURE THIS THING'S IN RANGE?

16:31.391 --> 16:34.364
STAN SOUNDS LIKE
AN OLD ITALIAN WOMAN.
IS THIS WHAT YOU PEOPLE DO--

16:34.364 --> 16:36.426
BOTTOM-FEED OUT OF THE FRIDGE
AND TALK ABOUT

16:36.426 --> 16:39.169
ME BEATING A GROWN MAN IN GOLF?
YOU AND BOBBY
PLAYED GOLF TODAY?

16:39.169 --> 16:42.232
(Ellie) STOP IT.
I'LL HIT THAT CHEESE
IF NO ONE'S GOING THERE.

16:42.232 --> 16:44.634
(Grayson) WHO'S THAT GUY?
HE'S JUST A VERY NICE,
NEW, SPECIAL FRIEND.

16:44.634 --> 16:47.107
MY MOM'S DATING HIM,
BUT IT'S EASIER FOR HER

16:47.107 --> 16:49.309
TO ACT LIKE I DON'T KNOW.
THEN DO THAT, TRAVIS.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.582
ALL RIGHT, BACK TO BOBBY.
HOW CAN WE FIX THIS?

16:52.582 --> 16:54.514
OH, I CAN TAKE HIM
TO VEGAS.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.486
YOU'RE DONE.
GO CHECK ON STAN.

16:56.486 --> 16:57.747
EH.

16:57.747 --> 16:59.719
CAN'T THIS GUY JUST SAY
HE CHEATED?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.291
GREAT IDEA, NEW DAD.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.123
DUDE.
DUDE.

17:03.123 --> 17:06.656
FANTASTIC!
WOW, BUT I GOTTA GO TO WORK.

17:06.656 --> 17:09.429
ADIOS, CRAZY PEOPLE.
I'M TAKING A WAFFLE.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.361
WAFFLES ARE FOR HELPERS!

17:11.361 --> 17:13.032
DUDE, GOTTA GO.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.235
GOOD TIMES, MOM.
I PROBABLY SHOULD GET GOING.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.208
YOU ARE COMING WITH ME.
COME ON.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.470
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING RIGHT
BACK TO WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

17:20.470 --> 17:22.472
PUBLIC-STYLE KISSING
WILL HAPPEN TODAY.

17:22.472 --> 17:25.515
I'VE JUST GOT ONE THING TO DO.
(starts engine)

17:25.515 --> 17:28.348
JULES, I'M SAD.
OKAY, TWO THINGS TO DO.

17:31.221 --> 17:33.223
YOU BROKE HIM.
YOU FIX HIM.

17:33.223 --> 17:35.285
COME ON, JOSH.
TRY TO KEEP UP.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.359
JULES SAID YOU'D MAKE ME
SOME SOUP.
(door closes)

17:39.359 --> 17:40.530
SOUP?

17:40.530 --> 17:42.262
SOUP!

17:43.663 --> 17:46.796
HEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

17:46.796 --> 17:48.738
SURE.

17:48.738 --> 17:51.571
WOW. YOU FLOPPED DOWN
ON THAT CHAIR,

17:51.571 --> 17:54.274
AND YOU BARELY HAD
ANY JIGGLE AT ALL.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.406
IT'S BECAUSE I CAN'T GET
THIS STUPID BRA OFF.

17:56.406 --> 17:58.348
APPARENTLY, YOU HAVE
TO WEAR IT FOREVER.
ALL RIGHT, DO YOU WANNA KNOW

17:58.348 --> 18:00.750
WHY I LOST MY JINKIES ON YOU
ABOUT THAT OPEN HOUSE?

18:00.750 --> 18:03.853
YEAH, SO YOU COULD SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HIM.
(mouths words)

18:03.853 --> 18:07.487
NO, STAY OUT THERE! YES, I DO
WANNA TAKE MORE TIME FOR MYSELF.

18:07.487 --> 18:10.190
NOW I HAVE EARNED THAT, BUT--
ALL RIGHT.

18:10.190 --> 18:14.264
I'M GONNA GET A LITTLE CORNY
AND... BRACE YOURSELF.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.396
(sighs) READY.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.668
YOU REMIND ME OF ME
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

18:18.668 --> 18:20.370
(scoffs)

18:20.370 --> 18:22.802
YOU DO. YOU JUST HAVE
ALL THIS POTENTIAL,

18:22.802 --> 18:25.805
AND YOU DON'T REALIZE YOU COULD
DO ANYTHING WITH YOUR LIFE.

18:25.805 --> 18:29.139
I JUST WANT YOU TO WANT MORE
FOR YOURSELF.
I DO! I WENT TO A PARTY

18:29.139 --> 18:31.141
WITH A PROFESSIONAL-GRADE
MARGARITA MACHINE,

18:31.141 --> 18:33.783
AND I LEFT BECAUSE I CARED
ABOUT DOING A GOOD JOB.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.448
WHAT, DID YOU LOSE A BET?

19:38.448 --> 19:40.350
UH, I WON A BET.

19:40.350 --> 19:41.711

19:41.711 --> 19:44.384
I KNOW YOU HAD AN APPOINTMENT

20:27.226 --> 20:29.529
HE KISSES WITH A PERFECT SEAL
AROUND YOUR MOUTH

20:29.529 --> 20:33.232
LIKE HE'S TRYING
TO SUCK YOUR BRAINS OUT.
I KNOW, BUT HE'S GOTTEN
SO MUCH BETTER.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.565
THAT'S BETTER?
I'LL GO GET US SOME MORE DRINKS.

20:35.565 --> 20:38.368

20:52.922 --> 20:55.555

21:10.269 --> 21:13.272
I'M 40. ABOUT TIME I FIND
SOMETHING NEW TO HANG MY HAT ON.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.275

21:16.275 --> 21:19.309
BUT MARK MY WORDS,
I WILL FIND IT.

21:19.309 --> 21:23.713
