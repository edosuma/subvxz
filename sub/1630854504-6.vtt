WEBVTT

00:49.497 --> 00:51.637
You're getting good at that.

00:55.365 --> 00:58.265
Your heart's not in it anymore,
is it?

00:58.265 --> 01:00.060
Is it that obvious?

01:01.233 --> 01:04.098
Maybe it's time to let someone
else take over the reins.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.931
Come on then, load her up.

01:12.900 --> 01:16.973
You know I did offer
to help plan the wedding.

01:16.973 --> 01:21.011
I was thinking somewhere
grand, iconic.

01:21.011 --> 01:24.463
Leeds Castle,
Canterbury Cathedral.

01:24.463 --> 01:27.949
No, Laila had to do it
all herself and...

01:27.949 --> 01:29.917
Here we are.

01:29.917 --> 01:33.748
- Oysters?
- Champagne.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.888
I'll send someone over.

01:37.580 --> 01:39.271
Monster-in-law alert.

01:39.271 --> 01:40.548
Oh, hmm.

01:40.548 --> 01:42.688
Oh, I'm Laurie.

01:42.688 --> 01:43.793
Oh, you're the celebrant?

01:43.793 --> 01:45.553
Yeah, well, uh, a friend.

01:45.553 --> 01:47.935
doing, uh, Adnan and Laila
a favor.

01:47.935 --> 01:50.179
- Aw.
- Yeah, it's my first time.

01:50.179 --> 01:52.388
Right, well, you'll need
some champagne, too, then.

01:52.388 --> 01:54.148
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll send someone over.

01:54.148 --> 01:57.047
Oh, thank you.

02:02.708 --> 02:04.331
Just imagine everyone naked.

02:04.331 --> 02:06.885
Uh, my parents
are in there.

02:06.885 --> 02:08.162
Oh, well, maybe not then.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.509
Yeah, maybe not.

02:10.509 --> 02:11.924
Right, while you're here,
maybe you can just

02:11.924 --> 02:13.167
help me out a little.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.513
Okay, go on.

02:14.513 --> 02:15.756
Okay, do you reckon
I should lead with...

02:17.171 --> 02:18.724
"I take no responsibility
for the views

02:18.724 --> 02:19.932
and comments of my mother."

02:19.932 --> 02:22.452
- Mmm...
- Or, hear me out.

02:22.452 --> 02:24.178
"This is the longest one night
stand I've ever had."

02:24.178 --> 02:25.628
- Oh, very heartfelt.
- What?

02:26.905 --> 02:28.251
It's gonna be great.

02:28.251 --> 02:29.632
Yeah.

02:30.253 --> 02:33.222
I just really don't
want to mess this up.

02:37.743 --> 02:41.437
Well, I think it's time to make
an honest man of myself.

02:41.437 --> 02:43.818
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

03:21.891 --> 03:26.309
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence

03:26.309 --> 03:28.242
of love.

03:30.589 --> 03:33.420
Before you got married.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.111
Why are you bringing this up
on my wedding day?

03:35.111 --> 03:36.285
I'll tell her when I need
to tell her.

03:36.285 --> 03:37.665
This needs to be something--

03:37.665 --> 03:40.599
It's my marriage.
Just leave it, alright?

03:40.599 --> 03:43.015
Sorry.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.293
Just leave it.

03:44.293 --> 03:46.087
They're about to take
the photos, so...

03:46.087 --> 03:48.883
- So?
- Come on, let's have some fun.

03:48.883 --> 03:50.506
Ruby.

04:03.553 --> 04:05.452
Ooh.

04:05.452 --> 04:07.454
It is a weird place
to get married.

04:07.454 --> 04:09.766
What, roller coasters
and ghost trains?

04:09.766 --> 04:11.285
It's not my ideal wedding.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.942
Could be Tom's though.

04:12.942 --> 04:14.461
Oh, my God, you're so right.

04:15.565 --> 04:17.015
Let's swap.

04:17.015 --> 04:19.051
It is so Tom.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.674
Don't put any ideas in his head.

04:20.674 --> 04:22.296
Let's go on this one.

04:26.852 --> 04:29.096
Charlie would love this.

04:29.096 --> 04:30.822
Yeah.

04:30.822 --> 04:32.686
Do you miss him?

04:32.686 --> 04:34.308
Yeah.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.692
Let's go and explore in there.

04:40.349 --> 04:43.697
Ooh!

04:47.459 --> 04:49.530
It's mad, it's so weird.

04:51.670 --> 04:52.844
Ruby?

04:52.844 --> 04:53.845
Hello?

04:53.845 --> 04:56.088
Hello!

04:56.088 --> 04:57.538
Where are you?

04:57.538 --> 04:58.850
I'm here!

04:58.850 --> 05:00.403
Where's here?

05:00.403 --> 05:02.750
I am so lost.

05:03.510 --> 05:05.719
I don't think
we're gonna get out.

05:33.367 --> 05:35.680

06:52.273 --> 06:55.000
It wasn't a frenzied attack.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.278
There's no blood spatter,
there's no evidence

06:57.278 --> 07:01.628
of a struggle,
no broken mirrors.

07:01.628 --> 07:04.113
She trusted the killer.

07:05.908 --> 07:08.048
Right, check for CCTV.

07:08.048 --> 07:09.877
Start looking for
the murder weapon.

07:09.877 --> 07:12.535
And I want witness statements
from everyone before they leave.

07:12.535 --> 07:15.055
Well, it was
a twilight wedding.

07:15.055 --> 07:18.092
So, most of them
are still pissed.

07:18.092 --> 07:19.646
I don't care.
Get everyone a coffee.

07:19.646 --> 07:20.957
Get yourself one, too.

07:20.957 --> 07:22.994
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be a late one.

07:22.994 --> 07:25.134
It really is.

07:44.843 --> 07:46.845
Pearl.

07:46.845 --> 07:48.019
Hey.

07:48.019 --> 07:49.296
You all right?

07:49.296 --> 07:50.987
How's Adnan doing?

07:50.987 --> 07:52.575
Oh, he's still in shock.

07:55.336 --> 07:57.891
Did you see anyone else
in there?

07:57.891 --> 07:59.513
- No.
- No?

07:59.513 --> 08:02.136
No, it was just me and Ruby.

08:02.136 --> 08:03.897
What were you
doing in there?

08:03.897 --> 08:06.382
We were on a break. We were just
mucking about, having a laugh.

08:06.382 --> 08:08.004
Right.

08:12.112 --> 08:13.700
We can do this later if...

08:16.910 --> 08:19.947
No. No, I'm fine.

08:19.947 --> 08:22.605
- Sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:23.744 --> 08:26.402
Okay, can you talk me
through the day?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.337
Um...

08:30.337 --> 08:33.305
Well, there was rivalry
between the two families.

08:33.305 --> 08:34.790
Mm-hmm.

08:34.790 --> 08:36.792
Adnan's mum, Hiral, she, um...

08:36.792 --> 08:39.967
well, she wasn't happy
about any of it.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.349
Not the venue
or the guest list.

08:42.349 --> 08:44.627
Or the bride.

08:44.627 --> 08:47.803
She wasn't so picky
about the booze though.

08:47.803 --> 08:50.737
Yeah, do you reckon
she was drowning her sorrows?

08:50.737 --> 08:53.153
Or a shot of Dutch courage?

08:56.328 --> 08:59.780
What about the groom?
What do you make of him?

08:59.780 --> 09:03.439
He seems like a nice guy.

09:03.439 --> 09:05.372
He was nervous.

09:05.372 --> 09:09.687
About his speech
and getting married.

09:09.687 --> 09:11.378
He was having an argument
with a woman earlier

09:11.378 --> 09:13.449
in a-- in a blue dress.

09:13.449 --> 09:15.002
Yeah?

09:15.002 --> 09:16.348
Yeah.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.937
It was intense and private.

09:18.937 --> 09:21.871
Where is she?

09:21.871 --> 09:26.186
Oh, I can't see her.
I'm sorry.

09:29.189 --> 09:30.846
I was right there, Mike.

09:36.196 --> 09:38.612
Come here. It's all right.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.374
Yeah.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.617
We found this under the mirrors.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.170
It's Laila's.

09:47.207 --> 09:49.899
It was sent 15 minutes
before the body was found.

09:49.899 --> 09:53.454
And his phone was found
in his mum's handbag.

09:53.454 --> 09:56.216
Okay. Arrest them both.

09:59.322 --> 10:01.877
- I've got to go, all right?
- Yeah.

10:37.153 --> 10:39.708
I mean, I just can't get
my head around it.

10:39.708 --> 10:41.744
I met them a few times when
they were planning their menu,

10:41.744 --> 10:43.539
and they seemed so in love.

10:43.539 --> 10:46.266
Honestly, I mean,
why plan a big wedding?

10:46.266 --> 10:47.854
Why get married
if he was gonna kill her?

10:47.854 --> 10:49.545
Pearl.

10:49.545 --> 10:51.305
Well, if Adnan didn't do it,
then who else could it be?

10:51.305 --> 10:52.893
Well, his mum was awful.

10:52.893 --> 10:55.309
I mean, she was a snob,
an out of control drunk.

10:55.309 --> 10:58.243
That's not a nice thing to say
about Dolly, is it, Pearl?

10:58.243 --> 11:01.212
Oi! I can hold my drink.

11:01.212 --> 11:03.076
This is not taking it easy.

11:03.076 --> 11:04.871
You're supposed to be at home
with your feet up.

11:04.871 --> 11:07.045
Tea, chocolate,
non-violent box sets.

11:07.045 --> 11:09.082
Honestly, I'm fine.
I'm happier if I'm busy.

11:09.082 --> 11:10.290
Let me take over here.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.843
No.
Bill's bringing the wine in.

11:11.843 --> 11:13.914
Why don't you do that
if you want to help?

11:17.504 --> 11:19.540
We've got
them well trained.

11:21.542 --> 11:24.200
Life is good.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.962
So leave this one to the police.

11:34.176 --> 11:36.868
Your phone sent
a message saying,

11:36.868 --> 11:38.905
"Meet me in the mirror maze."

11:38.905 --> 11:40.734
I did not send that message.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.080
Then who did?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.737
Your mum?

11:46.878 --> 11:48.604
What, what?

11:48.604 --> 11:51.331
Why would you think that?
No, no, of course not.

11:51.331 --> 11:53.747
Well, we found
your phone in her bag.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.438
Was she
hiding it for you?

11:59.132 --> 12:00.720
I don't...

12:00.720 --> 12:03.757
I have no idea
how that got there.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.621
Listen to me.

12:05.621 --> 12:07.554
We've spoken to
numerous witnesses.

12:07.554 --> 12:09.901
No one can place
Hiral at the time of the murder.

12:09.901 --> 12:12.110
No, you stop.
Stop right now, okay?

12:12.110 --> 12:15.562
My mum-- my mum
did not do this.

12:18.634 --> 12:20.774
And no one can place you either.

12:26.124 --> 12:27.954
Funny that.

12:32.199 --> 12:33.545
I don't do instant.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.030
Go on.

12:35.030 --> 12:37.342
You had a lot
to drink yesterday.

12:37.342 --> 12:39.828
We were celebrating.

12:39.828 --> 12:41.381
Yeah, we've got witnesses
who say you were still

12:41.381 --> 12:43.970
"celebrating"
after Laila's body was found.

12:45.661 --> 12:48.146
You didn't like Laila, did you?

12:48.146 --> 12:50.597
You didn't approve.

12:50.597 --> 12:51.978
Did you write that
message, Hiral?

12:51.978 --> 12:54.083
Don't be ridiculous!

12:54.083 --> 12:55.533
So Adnan wrote it?

12:55.533 --> 12:57.984
You protecting him?

12:57.984 --> 13:01.366
This is
so far fetched.

13:01.366 --> 13:03.265
So who wrote it?

13:03.265 --> 13:06.406
Whoever killed Laila.

13:06.406 --> 13:08.442
So someone stole the phone
from Adnan

13:08.442 --> 13:11.307
without him noticing,
wrote Laila a message,

13:11.307 --> 13:14.069
and then planted the phone
in your bag.

13:14.069 --> 13:16.657
Again without you noticing.

13:16.657 --> 13:18.867
I think you're right.

13:18.867 --> 13:22.698
That does sound
a bit far fetched.

13:22.698 --> 13:26.598
You were seen arguing with
a woman after the ceremony.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.221
Who is she?

13:33.191 --> 13:35.849
Cassie Lawrence. She's...

13:35.849 --> 13:37.540
She's just an ex.

13:37.540 --> 13:40.854
Arguing with your ex?
At your wedding?

13:40.854 --> 13:42.304
She won't leave me alone.

13:44.927 --> 13:47.861
I've moved on. She hasn't.
It's pretty simple.

13:51.451 --> 13:53.315
Look, Laila was friends
with her, okay?

13:53.315 --> 13:58.320
So she decided to invite her,
not me. That's...

13:58.320 --> 14:00.460
That's just the kind of person
Laila was.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.876
Where is she now?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.498
Cassie?

14:08.295 --> 14:11.885
You are wasting valuable time!

14:11.885 --> 14:15.337
Me, my mum, Cassie,
it's a joke.

14:19.065 --> 14:22.068
Okay, look, I'm sorry,
okay? I...

14:26.589 --> 14:30.662
Look, for the past
six months, we've, um...

14:30.662 --> 14:33.148
we've been getting these calls
on the landline.

14:33.148 --> 14:35.909
Like prank, nuisance calls.

14:35.909 --> 14:38.084
How often?

14:38.084 --> 14:39.948
9, 10 times a day.

14:39.948 --> 14:41.570
Sometimes more.

14:44.297 --> 14:47.058
And it's always when I'm out.

14:47.058 --> 14:48.473
Laila picks up the phone

14:48.473 --> 14:50.786
and then whoever's calling
just hangs up.

14:50.786 --> 14:53.582
So someone's been
harassing Laila?

14:53.582 --> 14:56.136
Is that what you're saying?

14:56.136 --> 14:58.311
I guess. Yeah.

14:58.311 --> 15:00.106
Yeah, I mean, you know,

15:00.106 --> 15:01.935
we obviously didn't take it
seriously at the time.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.316
But yes.

15:03.316 --> 15:06.146
9 or 10 times a day?

15:09.701 --> 15:12.359
Sounds like someone
who really hated her.

15:12.359 --> 15:14.948
We are a family of doctors.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.743
Laila worked in social care.

15:16.743 --> 15:18.538
Her parents don't work at all.

15:18.538 --> 15:21.230
Her brother's been in
and out of prison.

15:21.230 --> 15:23.543
Who knows what kind of people
he's involved with.

15:23.543 --> 15:25.648
They're who you should be
talking to.

15:25.648 --> 15:29.342
So, you thought Adnan was
making a mistake marrying Laila?

15:29.342 --> 15:32.345
And you'd do anything for
your son wouldn't you, Hiral?

15:32.345 --> 15:34.795
Lie.

15:34.795 --> 15:36.418
Even kill.

15:37.695 --> 15:38.972
I know what you're doing.

15:38.972 --> 15:42.251
Where were you
after the ceremony?

15:42.251 --> 15:45.358
I told you.
I don't remember.

15:45.358 --> 15:48.395
Well, you were blackout drunk.

15:49.051 --> 15:51.709
You could have been anywhere.

15:51.709 --> 15:53.676
Doing anything.

15:53.676 --> 15:55.782
You could have killed her.

15:55.782 --> 15:57.887
And you still wouldn't remember.

16:09.416 --> 16:11.211
Hey.

16:14.870 --> 16:16.009
Are you okay?

16:16.009 --> 16:19.012
Yeah, I just...

16:19.012 --> 16:20.289
thought I'd see how you are.

16:20.289 --> 16:23.361
Oh, I'm all right. Thanks.

16:26.847 --> 16:28.194
Any progress?

16:28.194 --> 16:30.679
Well, we let
Adnan and Hiral go.

16:30.679 --> 16:32.405
We need more if
we're gonna charge 'em.

16:32.405 --> 16:33.854
We're just short
on evidence, so...

16:33.854 --> 16:35.580
No murder weapon?

16:35.580 --> 16:37.617
Nah.

16:37.617 --> 16:40.516
This woman that you saw
Adnan arguing with.

16:40.516 --> 16:41.862
Just talk me
through that again.

16:41.862 --> 16:43.692
Well, she looked
angry and upset.

16:43.692 --> 16:46.039
Mmm.

16:46.039 --> 16:48.317
They were in each other's faces.

16:49.663 --> 16:52.839
It did look like the sort
of argument a couple would have.

16:52.839 --> 16:55.290
Her name's Cassie Lawrence.

16:55.290 --> 16:57.499
She's Adnan's ex.

16:57.499 --> 17:00.674
Does that give her a motive?

17:00.674 --> 17:03.091
Well, we can't find her.

17:03.091 --> 17:05.714
Now, Adnan said Laila's been
getting nuisance calls.

17:05.714 --> 17:07.095
Really?

17:07.095 --> 17:08.717
We checked.
He's telling the truth.

17:08.717 --> 17:10.339
Someone's been harassing her.
Calling and hanging up.

17:10.339 --> 17:12.100
Multiple times a day.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.618
Well, could that be this Cassie?

17:13.618 --> 17:15.103
Well, initially
that's what we thought.

17:15.103 --> 17:17.657
But we traced the calls
to a number,

17:17.657 --> 17:20.315
registered to a name
and address in Derby.

17:20.315 --> 17:22.420
Someone called Emily Forrest.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.904
Okay.

17:23.904 --> 17:25.699
Yeah, she seems
to have disappeared, too.

17:25.699 --> 17:28.461
So, what you thinking?

17:28.461 --> 17:31.636
Maybe Adnan
was sleeping around?

17:31.636 --> 17:35.123
Well, that doesn't
make him a killer.

17:35.123 --> 17:37.125
I don't buy it was him.

17:37.125 --> 17:40.369
I mean, why do it on your
wedding day when you're

17:40.369 --> 17:42.095
surrounded by your all your
friends and your family?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.993
It doesn't make sense.

17:49.137 --> 17:51.449
I can't get the image of Laila
out of my head.

17:54.659 --> 17:56.523
It's enough to put you
off weddings for life.

17:58.594 --> 18:01.666
No chance of you
proposing soon then?

18:01.666 --> 18:03.461
Eh?

18:03.461 --> 18:05.118
To Kat.

18:07.327 --> 18:08.742
Nah.

18:08.742 --> 18:12.160
Nah, that's all over.

18:12.160 --> 18:17.372
Me and Kat, we're--
we're not together any more.

18:17.372 --> 18:18.994
Oh.

18:21.617 --> 18:24.413
Oh, Mike, I'm sorry.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.228
Mike and Kat split up.

18:46.228 --> 18:48.541
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

18:48.541 --> 18:49.852
Poor Mike.

18:51.889 --> 18:53.546
That's sad.

18:53.546 --> 18:56.583
Yeah. I know. It is.

19:24.818 --> 19:26.751
I'm so sorry, Adnan.

19:31.377 --> 19:34.207
I'm sorry. Are you here
for the invoice, or...?

19:34.207 --> 19:37.003
Oh, no, no.
No, forget about that.

19:37.003 --> 19:39.557
I came-- I came 'cause I wanted
to give you this.

19:39.557 --> 19:41.249
I'm a private detective.

19:41.249 --> 19:43.458
I just wanted to offer
some help.

19:45.770 --> 19:49.671
Right, um...

19:49.671 --> 19:53.847
Wait, you know the police think
I did it, don't you?

19:53.847 --> 19:56.436
It's insulting, and it--
and it's insane.

19:56.436 --> 19:58.783
Look, I know Laila
was getting nuisance calls.

19:58.783 --> 20:02.822
Maybe-- maybe I could
track them down.

20:02.822 --> 20:04.686
Find out who it was.

20:04.686 --> 20:06.653
Emily Forrest, apparently.

20:06.653 --> 20:08.517
Well...

20:08.517 --> 20:09.863
that's who the police
said it was.

20:09.863 --> 20:13.246
And do you know her?

20:13.246 --> 20:14.868
Not even heard of her.

20:19.287 --> 20:22.704
Well, maybe--
maybe I could find her.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.295
Uh, yeah.

20:27.295 --> 20:29.435
Yeah, no, that--
that would be great.

21:09.475 --> 21:10.476
Nikki.

21:10.476 --> 21:12.098
<i>Brace yourself.</i>

21:12.098 --> 21:13.444
What now?

21:13.444 --> 21:15.860
We might have found
the murder weapon.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.380
<i>You better get here.</i>

21:38.124 --> 21:40.782
Oh, Laurie. Hi.

21:40.782 --> 21:43.025
Hi, uh...

21:43.025 --> 21:46.512
Uh, you saw me at Adnan's.

21:46.512 --> 21:48.134
Mm.

21:48.134 --> 21:50.585
Yeah, we just didn't want you
to get the wrong idea.

21:50.585 --> 21:52.138
What do you mean the wrong idea?

21:52.138 --> 21:55.348
Well, I mean you saw Adnan, too.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.593
He's-- he's devastated.

21:58.593 --> 22:01.043
He's broken.

22:01.043 --> 22:02.700
Look, I know
what the police think,

22:02.700 --> 22:04.530
but he didn't kill Laila.

22:06.532 --> 22:08.741
Is there something going on?
Are you two...?

22:08.741 --> 22:12.952
Okay, I-I'm just
gonna be honest.

22:12.952 --> 22:15.057
Yeah, yeah.

22:15.057 --> 22:16.749
Yeah, there is something
going on.

22:16.749 --> 22:20.028
It's been going on for a while.

22:22.824 --> 22:25.620
You officiated their wedding.

22:25.620 --> 22:27.553
I know. I am not proud of that.

22:27.553 --> 22:30.556
I mean, I-I agreed to do it
before we...

22:30.556 --> 22:32.558
you know, and...

22:32.558 --> 22:36.182
the venue was booked, and Adnan
didn't want to upset his family.

22:36.182 --> 22:38.564
I mean, he-- he was gonna
tell Laila.

22:38.564 --> 22:40.393
He-- he was.

22:40.393 --> 22:43.431
Oh, Laurie.

22:43.431 --> 22:44.846
They all say that.

22:44.846 --> 22:48.401
Oh, no, look,
everything happened so fast.

22:48.401 --> 22:49.851
There wasn't time.

22:49.851 --> 22:52.543
Like, he had to
go through with it.

22:55.408 --> 22:58.411
Do you know an Emily Forrest?

22:58.411 --> 23:00.689
Uh, no.

23:00.689 --> 23:02.415
Or a Cassie Lawrence?

23:07.075 --> 23:10.078
Well, maybe you don't know Adnan
as well as you think you do.

23:12.252 --> 23:14.116
We love each other.

23:15.670 --> 23:19.432
Look, everything that
has happened is so awful.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.470
It's-- it's unimaginable.

23:22.470 --> 23:25.334
But this has nothing to do
with Adnan.

23:25.334 --> 23:28.890
That-- that is why I'm here.
I need you to believe that.

23:49.048 --> 23:52.051
For the tape, I'm showing
a photograph of evidence

23:52.051 --> 23:54.502
labeled MR13.

23:57.884 --> 23:59.955
Miss Nolan, can you describe
what this is?

24:04.477 --> 24:05.858
For the tape.

24:05.858 --> 24:08.101
It looks like one of my
oyster shuckers.

24:13.072 --> 24:14.522
Alright go, go on.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.904
For the tape.

24:17.904 --> 24:20.528
Sergeant Nikki Martel
is leaving the room.

24:20.528 --> 24:21.874
For the tape.

24:21.874 --> 24:23.945
Do you honestly think
I killed Laila?

24:26.948 --> 24:28.881
No, but whoever did used
your oyster shucker.

24:28.881 --> 24:30.986
So can you do me a favor?
Will you help me out?

24:30.986 --> 24:33.092
You know what this means,
don't you?

24:33.092 --> 24:35.577
That the murder
wasn't planned.

24:35.577 --> 24:37.752
You think someone saw
an opportunity and went for it.

24:37.752 --> 24:40.720
Yeah, when their blood was up
in the heat of the moment,

24:40.720 --> 24:42.860
maybe after an argument.

24:42.860 --> 24:45.276
Have you heard
from Cassie yet?

24:53.353 --> 24:55.114
Cassie Lawrence?

24:56.633 --> 24:58.773
Look, I need
to tell you something.

24:58.773 --> 25:01.534
I went round to Adnan's
earlier today.

25:01.534 --> 25:02.949
You just can't help
yourself, can you?

25:02.949 --> 25:05.296
I'm sorry,
but Laurie was there.

25:05.296 --> 25:06.677
Who's Laurie?

25:06.677 --> 25:08.127
Laurie was the celebrant,
at the wedding.

25:08.127 --> 25:10.923
- Right, yeah.
- They're having an affair.

25:10.923 --> 25:13.719
So maybe Laurie killed Laila.

25:13.719 --> 25:15.928
I don't think so.
But I think he is playing her.

25:15.928 --> 25:18.931
You were right,
he is a serial cheat.

25:18.931 --> 25:23.383
Laila, Laurie, and this Emily.

25:23.383 --> 25:26.007
And Cassie.

25:26.007 --> 25:27.560
Why did you run?

25:27.560 --> 25:30.425
I was furious. With Adnan.

25:30.425 --> 25:32.600
'Cause he left you.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.016
I left him.

25:36.396 --> 25:40.159
He got together with Laila
straight after.

25:40.159 --> 25:42.195
We were friends. He--

25:42.195 --> 25:44.577
She wanted to stay close.

25:44.577 --> 25:47.960
I felt I owed her the truth.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.755
About what?

25:49.755 --> 25:52.171
That's what I was arguing
with Adnan about

25:52.171 --> 25:54.829
after the ceremony.

25:54.829 --> 25:57.625
I was livid.
That's why I left in a hurry.

25:58.660 --> 26:01.560
I came back as soon as I heard
what had happened.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.632
Cassie, why were you
and Adnan arguing?

26:09.947 --> 26:11.639
He was supposed to tell her.

26:13.675 --> 26:15.401
Tell her what?

26:25.376 --> 26:27.655
Look, am I free
to go now?

26:27.655 --> 26:31.141
Cassie just came in
for an interview.

26:31.141 --> 26:32.901
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:32.901 --> 26:35.248
She said she left Adnan because
he had a gambling problem.

26:35.248 --> 26:36.629
Apparently he's in debt.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.044
We're talking hundreds
of thousands.

26:38.044 --> 26:39.494
And he was hiding it
all from Laila.

26:39.494 --> 26:41.047
Well, that must have been
what they were arguing

26:41.047 --> 26:43.118
about at the wedding.

26:43.118 --> 26:45.811
So it was about money.
Who owns the house?

26:45.811 --> 26:47.329
Laila.

26:47.329 --> 26:48.986
And she's got
a life insurance policy,

26:48.986 --> 26:50.263
and she left it all to Adnan.

26:50.263 --> 26:51.851
Well, surely that's motive.

26:53.784 --> 26:56.028
It's circumstantial.

26:56.028 --> 26:57.788
So you've got no
real evidence.

27:05.037 --> 27:07.936
Adnan trusts me.

27:07.936 --> 27:10.698
Pearl.
We're not doing that.

27:10.698 --> 27:12.320
Technically,
I work for him anyway.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.770
He hired me to find Emily.

27:13.770 --> 27:15.254
I don't care.
You're not going round there.

27:15.254 --> 27:16.842
Look, if you talk to him,
you'll get his back up.

27:16.842 --> 27:19.154
- With me, he'll feel safe.
- No, no way.

27:19.154 --> 27:21.674
Yes, I could get him
to slip up.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.917
Listen, your fingerprints

27:22.917 --> 27:24.366
are the only ones
on that murder weapon.

27:24.366 --> 27:25.816
You promise me you're not
gonna go round there.

27:36.862 --> 27:38.449
- Hi.
- Laurie?

27:38.449 --> 27:39.554
Are you okay?

27:39.554 --> 27:41.694
Oh, gosh, yeah.

27:41.694 --> 27:43.247
Is Adnan here?

27:43.247 --> 27:45.698
He just, um-- he just
popped out for a walk.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.286
He needed to clear his head.

27:47.286 --> 27:49.737
Um, can I help?

27:49.737 --> 27:52.394
Well, he hired me to,
to find Emily Forrest.

27:52.394 --> 27:54.155
But I wanted to talk to him
about that.

27:54.155 --> 27:56.744
Oh, um, yeah, of course.

27:56.744 --> 27:59.505
He said-- Well, I mean,
he'll be back soon.

27:59.505 --> 28:02.059
Do you-- do you want to
come in, wait here?

28:02.059 --> 28:04.959
Okay.

28:04.959 --> 28:06.581
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:14.796 --> 28:18.110
So, that black eye?

28:18.110 --> 28:19.767
You gonna tell me
what happened, Laurie.

28:19.767 --> 28:22.286
Oh, it's not what you think.

28:22.286 --> 28:24.081
What do I think?

28:24.081 --> 28:26.014
You're gonna say it was Adnan.

28:26.014 --> 28:27.775
And it wasn't.

28:27.775 --> 28:30.156
Honestly, you've got
the wrong idea about him.

28:35.575 --> 28:37.888
Between you and me...

28:37.888 --> 28:39.648
it was Hiral.

28:42.962 --> 28:47.380
She came over earlier, and Adnan
didn't want to see her.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.176
Why?

28:50.176 --> 28:53.145
She'd been drinking and...

28:54.940 --> 28:57.321
This is what happens
when you put yourself

28:57.321 --> 29:00.255
between a mother
and her first born son.

29:00.255 --> 29:03.776
Why didn't Adnan
want to see her?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.951
Oh, uh...

29:05.951 --> 29:09.195
I-I shouldn't say any more.

29:09.195 --> 29:10.541
He'll be home soon.

29:10.541 --> 29:13.165
So, I'll just, uh, clear these.

29:22.553 --> 29:25.384
Why would Adnan need to kill
Laila for money?

29:25.384 --> 29:27.420
His family's loaded.

29:27.420 --> 29:29.043
Well, Cassie said he was
worried about what

29:29.043 --> 29:31.804
Hiral would think.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.151
- What, she'd disown him?
- Yeah.

29:34.151 --> 29:37.189
Apparently, the shame
would kill her.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.881
Little boys and their mothers.

29:39.881 --> 29:41.883
Story of every psycho.

29:44.403 --> 29:46.025
Nikki Martel.

29:48.407 --> 29:50.029
Yeah.

29:51.617 --> 29:52.894
Okay.

29:52.894 --> 29:55.448
Yep, thanks.

29:55.448 --> 29:57.071
Derbyshire Constabulary.

29:57.071 --> 29:59.038
They're e-mailing us
a mugshot through.

29:59.038 --> 30:01.282
Emily Forrest has form
for harassment.

30:11.913 --> 30:14.571
Where have all the photos
of Adnan and Laila gone?

30:14.571 --> 30:16.228
Oh, Adnan took them down.

30:16.228 --> 30:19.196
Everything's very raw.

30:19.196 --> 30:20.853
I see.

30:20.853 --> 30:24.615
So, uh...

30:24.615 --> 30:30.863
So what did you, uh, find out
about, uh, Emily, was it,

30:30.863 --> 30:33.486
from uh, Derby?

30:33.486 --> 30:36.351
Oh, it'll wait
till Adnan gets back.

30:37.766 --> 30:40.459
I probably, uh,
shouldn't say this,

30:40.459 --> 30:45.119
but Adnan always thought
it was Hiral.

30:45.119 --> 30:46.430
What was Hiral?

30:46.430 --> 30:49.019
Who was harassing Laila.

30:50.124 --> 30:51.746
Right.

31:27.368 --> 31:30.819
Sorry, um, Pearl, do you
want another cup of tea?

31:30.819 --> 31:35.134
Or, um, I don't know,
maybe a glass of wine?

31:38.689 --> 31:41.106
How did you know Emily Forrest
was from Derby?

31:43.384 --> 31:45.179
You told me.

31:45.179 --> 31:46.939
Did I?

31:49.977 --> 31:51.599
No, um...

31:51.599 --> 31:53.946
You told Adnan.
Adnan told me.

31:53.946 --> 31:56.121
Oh, that's right, yeah.

31:56.121 --> 31:58.157
So, what would you like?

31:58.157 --> 32:01.574
Yeah, go on then,
I'll have another cup of tea.

32:13.828 --> 32:16.417
Is that Adnan's phone?

32:16.417 --> 32:19.144
Yeah. Oh.

32:19.144 --> 32:20.973
He must of, uh, left it.

32:20.973 --> 32:23.976
Oh.

32:23.976 --> 32:26.013
Are you okay, Pearl?

32:26.013 --> 32:28.153
Yeah.

32:29.223 --> 32:31.432
Can I use the bathroom?

32:31.432 --> 32:34.573
Yeah, um, yeah, it's just, uh,
upstairs, um,

32:34.573 --> 32:35.712
first on the right.

32:35.712 --> 32:37.334
Thanks.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.663
Adnan, hey.

32:55.663 --> 32:58.010
Hey, hey, hey.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.770
Wake up.

32:59.770 --> 33:01.876
Has she drugged you?

33:01.876 --> 33:04.844
Hey, come on.

33:04.844 --> 33:06.018
Adnan.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.295
Pearl, help, help.

33:07.295 --> 33:09.021
It's all right.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.505
I'm gonna get help.

33:10.505 --> 33:12.162
- Laurie.
- Huh?

33:12.162 --> 33:13.508
- Laurie. It's Laurie.
- I know.

33:13.508 --> 33:15.200
I'll get help.

33:15.200 --> 33:19.100
It's all right, it's all right,
it's gonna be all right.

33:19.100 --> 33:22.414
Mike, don't freak out, okay?

33:44.815 --> 33:45.885
Laurie.

33:45.885 --> 33:48.474
Aw, Pearl.

33:48.474 --> 33:51.788
Oh, I know what it
looks like upstairs.

33:51.788 --> 33:53.928
Adnan's confused.

33:53.928 --> 33:56.551
I mean, I'm confused.

33:58.622 --> 34:00.797
But, um...

34:00.797 --> 34:02.557
But we love each other.

34:02.557 --> 34:05.491
We do.
Ever since we met.

34:05.491 --> 34:08.322
I believe you, Laurie.

34:08.322 --> 34:10.255
How did you meet?

34:10.255 --> 34:12.291
Oh, yeah.

34:12.291 --> 34:14.880
Yeah we-- we met
on a commuter train.

34:19.264 --> 34:23.268
Yeah, it was, uh,
it was love at first sight.

34:23.268 --> 34:25.304
For both of us.

34:25.304 --> 34:27.513
I mean, obviously it was um...

34:27.513 --> 34:29.550
it was more
complicated for Adnan.

34:29.550 --> 34:31.759
I mean, you've met his mother.

34:31.759 --> 34:34.106
And, um, he was getting married.

34:36.212 --> 34:39.249
The families couldn't agree
on a celebrant.

34:39.249 --> 34:43.115
I heard him arguing
on his mobile.

34:44.289 --> 34:46.567
So I told him
I'd done it before.

34:46.567 --> 34:48.672
Cor...

34:48.672 --> 34:51.986
Like a little,
little white lie.

34:51.986 --> 34:54.195
He was so grateful.

34:54.195 --> 34:56.163
I've never felt a connection
like it.

34:56.163 --> 34:59.373
It was-- it was euphoric.

35:04.171 --> 35:07.588
It wasn't supposed to end up
like this.

35:07.588 --> 35:09.141
Give me the lighter, Laurie.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.039
No, no, no, no.

35:12.800 --> 35:16.942
No, you called the police.
I heard you.

35:16.942 --> 35:19.565
I'm sorry. I-- I shouldn't
have done that.

35:19.565 --> 35:22.154
No.

35:22.154 --> 35:24.708
I mean, you don't understand.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.917
I do.

35:26.917 --> 35:28.333
He loves me.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.611
He really loves me.

35:30.611 --> 35:36.203
At the ceremony,
when he was reading his vows,

35:36.203 --> 35:38.550
when he was declaring
his love, he...

35:38.550 --> 35:40.517
he was looking right at me!

35:40.517 --> 35:41.863
Right at me!

35:41.863 --> 35:43.658
He was telling me
to do something.

35:43.658 --> 35:46.765
He was telling me to kill Laila!

35:46.765 --> 35:48.353
To make everything right!

35:48.353 --> 35:50.424
So we could be together,
and-- and if it's not right,

35:50.424 --> 35:54.704
if it's not right,
then what is the point!

36:11.203 --> 36:13.032
How you feeling, Adnan?

36:37.747 --> 36:39.369
I'm sorry.

36:57.698 --> 36:59.872
Would anybody else
like to share?

37:04.601 --> 37:06.258
Mike?

37:37.289 --> 37:38.911
Alright.

37:48.127 --> 37:50.544
I told myself I was gonna talk
about my wife today.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.308
I couldn't do it.

38:00.174 --> 38:02.280
What were you gonna say?

38:05.490 --> 38:07.319
That it was my fault she died.

38:13.877 --> 38:16.949
We were going to
a birthday party.

38:16.949 --> 38:18.710
One of my wife's friends.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.093
There was this case I was on.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.993
This guy killed his wife.
He was on the run.

38:25.993 --> 38:29.962
And I was spending all my time
looking for him.

38:29.962 --> 38:31.585
I was obsessed.

38:34.035 --> 38:38.143
And in the car on the way
there, she could tell that I...

38:38.143 --> 38:40.939
I just wasn't...

38:40.939 --> 38:42.941
I wasn't there, you know?

38:44.598 --> 38:47.635
She just said, "Relax."

38:47.635 --> 38:50.155
Just take the afternoon off
and enjoy the party.

38:55.919 --> 38:58.543
And that's when I saw him.

38:58.543 --> 39:01.960
This guy I'd been searching for
for months.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.376
I started to follow him.

39:04.376 --> 39:07.137
And then he ran a red light.

39:07.137 --> 39:08.760
So I ran the light.

39:10.762 --> 39:12.798
And another car...

39:16.181 --> 39:18.425
...smashed into the side of us.

39:24.638 --> 39:26.605
That was my fault.

39:28.745 --> 39:30.678
I'm sorry.

39:32.162 --> 39:34.026
I'm sorry.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.173
Yesterday, at Adnan's house,

39:43.173 --> 39:46.763
that-- that brought back
a lot of memories.

39:46.763 --> 39:48.662
That's not the same.

39:51.665 --> 39:54.495
That's not the same.
You told me not to go.

39:54.495 --> 39:56.601
I knew you were gonna go.

39:58.982 --> 40:01.329
Deep down, I knew.

40:01.329 --> 40:03.055
And I knew if you did,
we'd have a better chance

40:03.055 --> 40:04.919
of solving the case.

40:06.507 --> 40:08.785
Well, it was my decision.

40:08.785 --> 40:10.615
I knew the risk.

40:13.307 --> 40:15.447
I put you in danger.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.658
You didn't.

40:19.658 --> 40:21.936
You got there in time.

40:25.940 --> 40:28.909
I'm no good, Pearl.

40:28.909 --> 40:30.876
That's not true.

40:34.915 --> 40:37.814
Look, you're talking.

40:37.814 --> 40:40.127
You're going to therapy.

40:43.233 --> 40:45.339
I've got a lot to work through.

40:49.550 --> 40:51.276
Is that why you split up
with Kat?

40:55.245 --> 40:56.868
Maybe.

40:59.284 --> 41:00.906
Mike.

41:04.945 --> 41:07.499
Is it 'cause you're not ready
to be with someone?

41:09.915 --> 41:11.503
I want to be.

41:13.885 --> 41:15.921
But you can't.

42:10.286 --> 42:12.150
Down in one.

42:16.741 --> 42:18.984
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:18.984 --> 42:22.263
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right.

42:23.644 --> 42:26.578
So, remind me what Laurie
was suffering from?

42:26.578 --> 42:28.131
Erotomania.

42:28.131 --> 42:29.754
Love at first sight.

42:29.754 --> 42:32.204
And that's a bad thing?

42:32.204 --> 42:35.863
Well, if the other person
doesn't feel the same way

42:35.863 --> 42:38.383
and you're delusional
and you try to kill the person

42:38.383 --> 42:40.074
you're in love with, then yeah.

42:40.074 --> 42:43.146
Well, put it like that.

42:46.046 --> 42:50.050
I think we might have a case of
love at first sight right here.

42:50.050 --> 42:51.603
Hmm.

42:53.260 --> 42:54.606
Do they make you want to puke?

42:54.606 --> 42:56.781
Little bit, yeah.

42:56.781 --> 42:59.024
Down in one.

43:03.477 --> 43:05.617
Are we okay?

43:07.481 --> 43:08.965
Yeah.

43:10.622 --> 43:13.142
