WEBVTT

00:03.859 --> 00:05.839
Joey is not back from his date, uh ?

00:05.914 --> 00:10.135
No. I can't believe Donna's telling him her husband wants to get back together.

00:10.260 --> 00:13.038
He's gonna be crushed, so we have to be here to help him.

00:13.057 --> 00:13.983
Oh, of course.

00:14.099 --> 00:16.780
Man, it's just...it's weird for me to think of him as vulnerable.

00:16.838 --> 00:18.393
He's like a superhero to me.

00:18.496 --> 00:21.063
And not just because he always puts on a cape and jumps down the stairs.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.103
Hey, how was your date?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.944
So great.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.571
So, you didn't talk about anything?

00:29.701 --> 00:32.400
Oh, we talked about everything-- movies, sports,

00:32.619 --> 00:35.995
those commercials where it seems like Howie Long and Teri Hatcher are married.

00:37.757 --> 00:40.494
- Unbelievable.
- I know. What a weird couple.

00:41.942 --> 00:43.639
What did she say when you asked her to stay?

00:43.736 --> 00:45.569
Oh, I didn't get around to that.

00:45.607 --> 00:47.965
But after tonight, I think she might want to.

00:51.939 --> 00:55.797
Listen, Joey... there something I have to tell you about Donna,

00:55.855 --> 00:58.016
something she should've told you already.

00:59.274 --> 01:01.562
Oh, my God, we're related?!

01:05.209 --> 01:06.733
Why so many cousins?!

01:08.104 --> 01:09.319
No.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.156
Ron called her, and he wants to get back together, and she doesn't know what to do.

01:14.166 --> 01:14.822
What?

01:15.562 --> 01:16.785
I'm sorry.

01:17.828 --> 01:21.331
Wow. I can't believe this. This sucks.

01:21.738 --> 01:24.381
There's no way I stand a chance against Ron.

01:24.521 --> 01:26.461
They have years together.

01:27.002 --> 01:28.463
Joey, wait.

01:29.084 --> 01:31.765
If you really want this, you have to fight for her.

01:31.900 --> 01:33.677
You have to pull out all the stops.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.138
I've never had to fight for a girl before.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.555
I guess I've seen people do it in movies,

01:38.632 --> 01:42.477
but I can't just make Donna choose me by winning the Super Bowl with the help of a talking dolphin!

01:44.648 --> 01:48.734
I swear, we have 500 channels, and all you watch is HBO Family?

01:53.710 --> 01:55.908
Joey, look, you have the advantage.

01:55.957 --> 01:57.326
You're here and he's not.

01:57.556 --> 02:00.204
It's true, you know? This is your chance.

02:01.712 --> 02:04.208
Yeah, you're right. I can do this.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.335
I'm gonna fight for her, and I'm gonna win.

02:07.684 --> 02:09.670
- No, you don't need your cape.
- Right.

02:48.984 --> 02:50.170
Hey, Joey.

02:51.222 --> 02:53.884
Look, uh, Gina told me about Ron.

02:53.942 --> 02:55.003
We need to talk.

02:55.138 --> 02:58.428
Oh, I hate talking. Wouldn't you rather make out?

02:58.837 --> 03:03.058
Look, I like the way you deal with problems, but... this is serious.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.980
Joey, I'm sorry, I'm just so confused.

03:08.404 --> 03:09.606
Well, I'm not.

03:10.532 --> 03:13.569
Okay? And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make this work.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.238
But I need you to decide what you want.

03:16.540 --> 03:19.950
Now, it's obvious how I feel, but you have to figure out how you feel.

03:21.417 --> 03:24.246
I've only been on the receiving end of that speech,

03:24.454 --> 03:27.207
so if you want advice on what to do now,

03:28.041 --> 03:31.003
I like to pretend I see someone stealing my car and just run out the door.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.698
I just feel so torn.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.842
Ron and I have a lot of history,

03:36.898 --> 03:39.678
but on the other hand, things haven't been good with him for a long time.

03:39.743 --> 03:42.764
And I feel like things could be great with you, but I don't know.

03:42.886 --> 03:43.600
Then give me a week.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.944
Okay? Let me show you what this could be.

03:46.002 --> 03:49.146
Let me prove to you that you should be with me instead of Ron.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.940
I don't know if I should make him wait that long.

03:52.008 --> 03:54.151
- I told him about you, and he flipped out.
- So what?

03:55.211 --> 03:56.851
You deserve to be happy.

03:57.159 --> 03:59.031
Let me try to make you happy.

04:01.989 --> 04:05.037
- Okay, I'll give you a week.
- Great.

04:06.853 --> 04:08.281
All right, I'm gonna go plan it.

04:08.339 --> 04:10.191
What are your three favorite things?

04:10.326 --> 04:13.795
- Food, sex, watching TV.
- See ya, Ron!

04:20.011 --> 04:21.094
Hey, Michael.

04:21.416 --> 04:23.500
I'm trying to plan this romantic week with Donna.

04:23.539 --> 04:26.066
Do you know any nice bed-and-breakfasts in the area?

04:26.350 --> 04:27.784
Uh, actually, yes.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.714
Mom and I went to a great one in Santa Barbara.

04:29.752 --> 04:31.836
They thought we were a couple, they put rose petals on our beds--

04:31.913 --> 04:33.565
it was pretty disturbing.

04:34.922 --> 04:36.026
Hey, guys.

04:36.118 --> 04:37.738
So you called my friend about your computer, huh?

04:37.835 --> 04:40.113
Yes. He came by yesterday. Thank you very much.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.391
What was wrong with it?

04:41.429 --> 04:44.015
Her Unix kernel couldn't read command line prompts anymore

04:44.092 --> 04:46.954
because the frontside bus had stopped communicating with the memory cache.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.751
I just love that a guy I'm related to says crap like that.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.453
Anyway, he totally fixed my computer.

04:55.492 --> 04:57.865
And the best part is, he didn't even charge me for it.

04:58.039 --> 05:00.300
- Yeah, that figures.
- What do you mean?

05:00.373 --> 05:02.630
Well, you're a hot girl. Hot girls get stuff for free.

05:02.688 --> 05:04.638
Yeah, it's true. It's in the Constitution.

05:05.942 --> 05:09.377
Look, I know what I am. I'm not a hot girl. I'm cute.

05:09.415 --> 05:10.804
You're a hot girl who doesn't know she's hot.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.309
Joey was telling me about those.

05:12.386 --> 05:15.339
No, I know hot girls. My sister is one of them.

05:15.436 --> 05:18.696
"The even hotter sister"-- one of four ways a girl doesn't realize she's hot.

05:18.812 --> 05:22.906
Along with, "went to a girls' school," "used to be fat," and "is blind."

05:26.671 --> 05:28.871
You have learned well, young Michael.

05:30.143 --> 05:33.365
Okay, well, say what you want, but that is not why he didn't charge me.

05:33.422 --> 05:35.082
People don't see me that way.

05:35.178 --> 05:37.504
- You ever get a speeding ticket?
- No.

05:37.679 --> 05:39.131
- Hot girl.
- Hot girl.

05:40.664 --> 05:45.082
No, that's because I talk my way out of tickets, using my intelligence.

05:48.960 --> 05:51.018
I'm  not a hot girl.

05:53.958 --> 05:55.617
I am not a hot girl!

05:55.706 --> 05:57.316
I am. What do you need?

05:59.353 --> 06:01.958
Great. Okay, Gina, you're the perfect person to talk to.

06:02.016 --> 06:05.532
I have one week to convince Donna that she should be with me instead of Ron,

06:05.629 --> 06:07.910
and  I'm trying to come up with stuff that she might be into.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.938
Uh... just give her what any woman would like.

06:11.053 --> 06:14.166
Take her away to a nice hotel. Buy her flowers.

06:14.418 --> 06:17.736
- Take her to a fancy dinner.
- Great, great. What else?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.255
Um, there's a cool exhibit at the Museum of Natu...

06:24.352 --> 06:25.721
Hey,  you know where you should take her?

06:25.772 --> 06:28.377
Michael and I went to this great bed-and-breakfast in Santa Barbara.

06:28.454 --> 06:31.767
They thought we were a couple, they put rose petals on the bed.It was amazing!

06:33.602 --> 06:35.395
You guys should do that again.

06:43.807 --> 06:46.219
Hey, Howard. Yard sale, huh?

06:46.373 --> 06:48.825
Yup. Got to make way for the new Howard.

06:48.881 --> 06:52.538
I'm on Atkins, I joined a coed softball league, so look out, world!

06:54.449 --> 06:55.874
Everything must go.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.626
Except my chair.

06:58.138 --> 06:59.711
I got to have a place to sit.

07:00.392 --> 07:02.047
On account of the gout.

07:04.576 --> 07:06.260
So, broken, huh?

07:06.360 --> 07:09.331
You know, I could probably salvage the motion sensor from this.

07:09.466 --> 07:10.335
But 50 bucks?

07:10.527 --> 07:13.036
- It cost a lot more than that.
- Yeah, but it's broken.

07:13.217 --> 07:15.050
- How about $20?
- I don't think so.

07:15.127 --> 07:16.111
All right, how about $30?

07:16.188 --> 07:18.313
How about you stop hogging Joey all the time?!

07:23.521 --> 07:24.987
Hey, hot girl. More free stuff?

07:25.160 --> 07:26.781
No, I paid for this.

07:26.858 --> 07:30.812
And, look, I know you think that "hot girl" is a compliment, but I don't.

07:30.889 --> 07:33.378
You should see my sister and the stuff she gets away with.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.060
When she wants something, she puts on this little act.

07:36.291 --> 07:42.087
"Oh, What a cute doggie.I wish I had enoughmoney to buy him."

07:42.195 --> 07:45.224
- Oh, you like him?
- I love him.

07:45.475 --> 07:48.051
- I love you.
- Take it.

07:50.095 --> 07:50.788
What?

07:51.000 --> 07:51.680
He's yours.

07:52.405 --> 07:55.048
So you're just giving this to me because...

07:55.125 --> 07:57.186
Yeah. Because.

08:00.716 --> 08:03.901
- I am a hot girl!
-I told you.

08:03.960 --> 08:05.152
Oh, that's so cool!

08:05.445 --> 08:08.488
Oh, great, hog her now, too! Come on!

08:14.927 --> 08:17.873
Okay, I'm all set for Santa Barbara.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.660
Now, while I'm gone, don't you do anything I wouldn't do.

08:20.739 --> 08:22.875
- You mean read?
- Exactly.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.454
So, what do you have planned for Donna?

08:26.538 --> 08:28.833
Uh, we're going for a hot air balloon ride,

08:28.968 --> 08:31.920
wine tasting, and then horseback riding on the beach.

08:32.075 --> 08:33.889
Oh, that sounds perfect.

08:34.071 --> 08:36.225
We never did anything like that!

08:39.405 --> 08:41.188
You, uh, you think she'll like it?

08:41.313 --> 08:44.395
Oh, honey, if she doesn't, I'll talk some sense into her.

08:44.511 --> 08:47.787
No, no, no, you stay out of it. I don't want you going crazy on her.

08:47.844 --> 08:48.809
Why do you think I'd do that?

08:48.963 --> 08:52.147
Please. You're the only person I know who's banned for life from two K-Marts.

08:52.243 --> 08:54.201
I do not respect their return policy!

08:55.403 --> 08:57.062
All right, I'm gonna go pick up Donna.

08:57.216 --> 08:58.416
I am so excited.

08:58.513 --> 09:02.167
I just want this to work so badly. I want her to forget alabout Ron.

09:02.232 --> 09:05.003
Oh, Joey, don't worry about him-- he's 3,000 miles away.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.755
Yeah, you're right.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.675
Donna, open up. It's Ron!

09:10.978 --> 09:13.428
If he's 3,000 miles away, he's loud.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.352
Ron, what are you doing here?

09:20.519 --> 09:22.145
I'm taking Donna back to New York.

09:22.275 --> 09:25.315
And while I'm at it, I thought I'd beat the crap out of Joey Tribbiani!

09:25.774 --> 09:27.568
What do you think of that, Joey?

09:30.842 --> 09:33.490
- Um, actually...
- Kick his ass, Joe!

09:39.139 --> 09:41.994
Uh, look, i'm not Joey, ok? He's Joey

09:42.361 --> 09:44.626
Damnit, it's never the skinny guy !

09:46.040 --> 09:48.881
Listen, I came here to get Donna, I'm not going back without her.

09:49.004 --> 09:49.699
Now, where is she?

09:49.777 --> 09:51.918
- She's not staying here. She's...
- Gone. Yeah.

09:52.034 --> 09:54.178
She said it was over between us.

09:58.473 --> 10:00.267
What, she just took off?

10:00.889 --> 10:02.992
I guess I could try to call her. Can I use your phone?

10:03.108 --> 10:05.189
Yeah, yeah, sure. Whatever you need, buddy. Here.

10:05.392 --> 10:07.457
You, uh, you want some privacy?

10:07.515 --> 10:09.318
Yeah, that'd be great.

10:10.420 --> 10:11.500
What are you doing?

10:11.616 --> 10:12.793
You said you wanted me to fight for her?

10:12.831 --> 10:13.970
Okay, I'm fighting for her.

10:14.124 --> 10:15.687
But you just lied to that guy.

10:15.764 --> 10:19.036
- That's wrong.
- Michael!You embarrass me.

10:20.605 --> 10:23.236
Look, Ron's had five years to prove they should be together.

10:23.351 --> 10:24.958
All I want is my one week.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.263
And if I have to be crafty, okay, then I will.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.386
Then why'd you give him the phone and let him call her?

10:29.521 --> 10:31.215
'Cause I suck at crafts!

10:33.492 --> 10:35.135
Okay, we can't let them talk. What do I do?

10:36.810 --> 10:40.707
Gina, I'm not gonna strangle him with the phone cord.Oh, I get it, okay, got it.

10:42.216 --> 10:43.643
All right, so what are you gonna do?

10:43.759 --> 10:46.421
Well, uh, okay, I'm just gonna take her away, like I planned, right?

10:46.479 --> 10:47.907
She doesn't even need to know he was here.

10:48.003 --> 10:50.563
You go get Donna. I'll take care of Ron. I'll make sure he doesn't get in your way.

10:50.621 --> 10:53.361
Okay, you think you can keep him in the dark the whole time I'm gone?

10:54.459 --> 10:56.331
I tried calling, but the phone went dead.

10:56.369 --> 10:57.855
Oh, th-there was an earthquake.

10:57.932 --> 10:59.726
All the phone lines in the city are down.

10:59.880 --> 11:00.864
Really?

11:01.062 --> 11:02.760
Ooh, wait.

11:03.156 --> 11:04.957
Was that an aftershock?

11:05.604 --> 11:07.668
- Think I can handle it.
- You'll be okay. All right.

11:12.446 --> 11:14.091
Oh, how about this place for our next trip?

11:14.165 --> 11:16.468
Nestled in the heart of wine country.

11:16.635 --> 11:20.931
Private hot tubs, fireplace in every room, a lovers' paradise.

11:23.219 --> 11:25.519
What? Get a girlfriend, and I'll stop doing this.

11:28.184 --> 11:31.155
Hey. I got a free muffin at the coffee shop.

11:31.270 --> 11:32.601
See, what did I tell you?

11:32.679 --> 11:36.730
Hey, Mom, Alex has discovered that as an attractive woman she can get stuff from people.

11:37.135 --> 11:40.033
Yeah, now I've got Howard moving boxes down to storage for me.

11:41.967 --> 11:43.620
This one's really heavy.

11:46.741 --> 11:48.246
This is so exciting.

11:48.584 --> 11:51.044
Wait, all you're having Howard do is move stuff for you?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.292
You could do a lot better than that, believe me.

11:53.388 --> 11:54.965
What kind of stuff have you gotten?

11:55.215 --> 11:58.249
Oh, free drinks, flight upgrades, concert tickets.

11:58.346 --> 12:00.804
Piano lessons, SAT prep courses.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.766
Wow! A free muffin is, like, nothing.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.852
I guess I should think bigger.

12:07.115 --> 12:09.141
You'd better, 'cause when you're on your deathbed,

12:09.257 --> 12:13.609
you don't want to look back at your life and say, "I wish I had more free stuff."

12:16.003 --> 12:18.222
Are the earthquakes over? Can I come out now?

12:18.299 --> 12:22.159
No. We'll tell you when. Get back in the closet.

12:31.222 --> 12:36.562
Oh... this place is so romantic.

12:36.678 --> 12:39.398
Don't  you love bed and breakfasts?

12:39.553 --> 12:42.192
I've never actually been to one before, which is weird because

12:42.269 --> 12:44.681
beds and breakfasts are my two favorite things.

12:46.439 --> 12:49.186
I bet I know what number three is.

12:50.657 --> 12:51.756
Yeah.

12:53.261 --> 12:54.805
Baby tigers.

12:58.546 --> 13:02.241
In the morning, would the lady like a Los Angeles Times or a New York Times?

13:02.436 --> 13:04.868
- Neither.
- Excellent choice.

13:05.828 --> 13:06.986
What are you doing?

13:07.063 --> 13:10.111
- I just want to see if anyone called.
- No, don't check your phone.

13:10.188 --> 13:14.121
- Why?
- Because... we're here to get away from all this stuff.

13:14.295 --> 13:16.706
What's so important that it can't wait a couple of days?

13:16.803 --> 13:19.675
Well, my sister was supposed to have a baby...

13:19.842 --> 13:23.011
Shh... let all those worries just wash away.

13:24.002 --> 13:26.394
Come on, let's have some time just the two of us.

13:26.471 --> 13:28.475
Well, that does sound nice.

13:31.413 --> 13:33.188
This is gonna be so great.

13:38.445 --> 13:41.898
I have so many plans. We're going to go horseback riding,

13:42.406 --> 13:44.658
wine tasting, hot air balloon ride.

13:45.033 --> 13:50.289
See, this is so wonderful. This is why I want to be with you.

13:50.342 --> 13:53.834
- You do?
- Well, yeah.Ron would never do anything like this.

13:53.930 --> 13:56.420
He never made an effort to let me know he cared.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.798
You're about the big gestures.

13:58.914 --> 14:02.301
You're fighting for me. He'd never fight for me.

14:03.847 --> 14:05.762
huh. Yeah, um...

14:05.920 --> 14:08.486
But you guys had other problems, right?

14:08.563 --> 14:11.393
I mean, what you had was never really special.

14:11.571 --> 14:14.479
I wouldn't say that.We were married.

14:14.813 --> 14:18.984
I may have blacked out for most of my wedding day, but I remember those vows.

14:22.475 --> 14:26.575
If Ron were to do something to show you that he cared, like,

14:27.086 --> 14:31.099
I don't know, fly cross-country and beg you to come back, would that make a difference?

14:31.214 --> 14:33.332
It doesn't matter. He'd never do that.

14:36.287 --> 14:38.086
Okay, look, Donna. I, uh...

14:39.624 --> 14:40.955
I have to tell you something.

14:41.090 --> 14:41.958
What?

14:42.247 --> 14:44.524
You know how you said it was great that I brought you here

14:44.582 --> 14:46.700
and that Ron wouldn't do this kind of thing?

14:46.797 --> 14:49.139
Well, that's not entirely true.

14:50.349 --> 14:52.066
You didn't really bring me here?

14:55.229 --> 14:57.606
Oh, God, I'm gonna miss you so much.

15:02.605 --> 15:05.518
Oh, hey, I wanted to tell you that I took your advice

15:05.557 --> 15:08.367
about taking it to the next level with the whole "hot" thing.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.227
Oh, yeah? Good for you.

15:10.323 --> 15:12.955
Yeah, there are men in our apartment right now working.

15:13.247 --> 15:16.583
And I'm working "it" right back, if you know what I mean.

15:17.692 --> 15:19.294
Do you know what you mean?

15:20.351 --> 15:23.090
"It" is my butt, maybe?

15:23.733 --> 15:25.676
Sure, why not?

15:26.741 --> 15:28.846
- Oh, no.
- What?

15:29.180 --> 15:32.724
This is a bill from that guy who fixed my computer the other day.

15:32.814 --> 15:37.229
He charged me $80. Oh, I knew it. I'm not hot, I'm just cute.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.940
Oh, my God, I think I stole that muffin.

15:43.193 --> 15:46.524
Oh, hang on a second. This does not mean you are not hot.

15:46.620 --> 15:49.366
It just means you're not $80 hot.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.301
What about the guys in there? That's a lot more than $80.

15:52.397 --> 15:55.247
What are you having them do? A stereo system. In-wall.

15:55.664 --> 15:57.082
Sub-woofer?

15:59.238 --> 16:00.836
I'll take care of this.

16:06.664 --> 16:08.072
I rock.

16:08.149 --> 16:12.895
I just got Blondie a new stereo system at cost with free installation,

16:12.992 --> 16:15.876
plus a trade discount...from a gay dude.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.857
Hey, it's Joey and Donna. Wait a minute...

16:24.526 --> 16:26.361
She was with you the whole time?

16:26.470 --> 16:27.801
Look, I know you're mad at me.

16:27.878 --> 16:30.240
And you probably want to kick Michael's ass.

16:32.972 --> 16:35.635
But I'm trying to do the right thing, okay?

16:37.027 --> 16:39.917
And I think you two should be together.

16:40.159 --> 16:42.628
So why don't you guys talk?

16:47.841 --> 16:50.233
So what do you have to say to me?

16:51.780 --> 16:53.420
I  don't know, what do you have to say to me?

16:53.497 --> 16:55.388
I don't know, what do you have to say to me?

16:55.446 --> 16:56.294
I don't know, what do you...

16:56.352 --> 16:57.851
Okay, okay...

16:58.983 --> 17:00.507
I don't want to speak for Donna,

17:00.546 --> 17:03.151
but I really want this night to be over,

17:03.189 --> 17:05.025
so, Ron...

17:05.536 --> 17:06.984
Donna loves you.

17:07.607 --> 17:09.344
When we were driving over here, she told me that

17:09.382 --> 17:12.199
you understood her better than anyone in the whole world.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.493
And that she wants to spend the rest of her life with you...

17:15.786 --> 17:16.912
her soul mate.

17:18.377 --> 17:20.624
That's the sweetest thing you've ever said to me.

17:22.765 --> 17:26.276
Donna... this guy has so much passion for you

17:26.353 --> 17:29.383
that he flew all the way across the country to say he loves you

17:29.915 --> 17:32.344
and that he's not going back to New York without you.

17:33.084 --> 17:35.514
I've never heard you talk like this before.

17:37.412 --> 17:39.515
Okay. So, I got you started.

17:39.554 --> 17:41.194
You guys can take it from here.

17:46.728 --> 17:48.902
I miss doin' you so much.

17:53.598 --> 17:56.660
- Really?
- Okay, let's call it a night.

17:58.518 --> 18:00.065
Bye, Gina.

18:00.257 --> 18:01.874
Take care.

18:05.551 --> 18:08.773
- And, Joey...
- Hey, it's okay.

18:08.936 --> 18:10.841
No, I need to say this.

18:10.999 --> 18:12.384
I just...

18:14.117 --> 18:15.874
It was real, you know...

18:15.990 --> 18:18.682
I know. It was great.

18:20.538 --> 18:24.980
And in another time, another place, it could have been something more.

18:42.587 --> 18:45.709
I've never been the smartest person in the room before.

18:47.810 --> 18:49.546
That's a lot of work.

18:53.378 --> 18:54.927
I am so sorry, honey.

18:55.505 --> 18:57.930
That couldn't have been easy.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.474
It wasn't. It just hurts so much.

19:01.483 --> 19:04.628
Well, if it makes you feel any better, it could be worse.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.985
Once at this hi-tech conference, me getting rejected by a girl

19:08.062 --> 19:10.776
was accidentally broadcast to lecture halls on four continents.

19:13.697 --> 19:15.322
I feel like I've seen that.

19:15.424 --> 19:16.990
It's been going around the Internet.

19:19.299 --> 19:22.204
- I'm so sorry it didn't work out.
- Me, too.

19:22.881 --> 19:27.709
It was just nice having someone to take care of and do nice things for.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.295
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:30.431 --> 19:33.479
I mean, usually with me it's "How little can I do?"

19:33.575 --> 19:35.801
and "How fast can I move on to the next thing?"

19:38.274 --> 19:40.055
Maybe I'll try a little more of this.

19:41.535 --> 19:43.098
Want me to fix you up with someone?

19:43.445 --> 19:46.770
Uh, no. I think I've had enough of your friends for a while.

19:47.582 --> 19:49.606
You want me to fix you up with someone?

19:55.170 --> 19:56.280
Thanks, Michael.

20:06.558 --> 20:08.140
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.240
How you doing?

20:10.488 --> 20:12.437
Eh. I'm working on an audition for tomorrow...

20:12.707 --> 20:15.523
Maybe i could use all this heartache and stuff and ...

20:15.909 --> 20:18.552
you know, make my performance more powerful.

20:18.654 --> 20:19.803
Check it out :

20:20.331 --> 20:24.183
"Oh, boy, spicy saucages, Mama mia !"

20:26.633 --> 20:28.697
I'm sorry you got left alone this weekend.

20:28.774 --> 20:30.856
Where are Michael and Gina, anyway?

20:31.926 --> 20:35.652
Oh, this place is just the way I remembered it.

20:36.514 --> 20:39.740
Yep. There are those rose petals.
