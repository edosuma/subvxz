WEBVTT

00:23.833 --> 00:25.541
It's time for a queen.

00:31.416 --> 00:32.875
You sound just like

00:33.333 --> 00:34.166
Fisk.

00:34.166 --> 00:37.083
So, are you with me or against me?

00:41.916 --> 00:43.833
Your grandmother knows all that.

00:51.291 --> 00:53.375
Maybe you ask her?

01:10.208 --> 01:11.666
You're my family.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.291
I go too.

01:25.375 --> 01:26.666
Thank you, Uncle.

02:10.166 --> 02:11.000
Want.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.083
Want.

04:33.833 --> 04:35.041
Final?

04:47.833 --> 04:48.833
For what?

08:16.500 --> 08:18.083
What the hell is this?

08:21.625 --> 08:23.916
You can understand what I'm saying?

08:36.500 --> 08:38.458
I thought you were...

08:44.666 --> 08:46.666
Why are you here?

09:06.166 --> 09:07.333
It's Thursday.

10:15.916 --> 10:19.750
No. I can assure you I wanted you dead.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.541
Violence was always our language.

10:48.833 --> 10:50.041
I used to.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.750
I'll open the wine.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.791
I poured it down the drain.

13:37.208 --> 13:39.125
Why are you here?

15:04.833 --> 15:06.875
Wait, you had dinner?

15:06.875 --> 15:10.208
He's handing me "queenpin".

15:11.791 --> 15:13.833
Please tell me

15:13.833 --> 15:16.541
you're not that stupid.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.041
Just because you don't think I can--

15:19.041 --> 15:20.875
I know you can.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.791
That's what scares me.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.916
You know why I'm 45 and alone?

15:40.708 --> 15:42.541
Because everyone I cared about

15:42.541 --> 15:44.791
was taken away by him.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.833
After your father died,

15:51.833 --> 15:54.000
I tried to get out.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.125
Fisk

15:57.125 --> 15:58.750
threatened to kill me

15:58.750 --> 15:59.958
if I did.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.250
So...

16:02.458 --> 16:04.333
I came back here

16:05.250 --> 16:08.416
and did his dirty work.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.291
And I

16:11.833 --> 16:13.416
don't

16:13.416 --> 16:14.916
want you

16:15.208 --> 16:16.458
to become me.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.250
You say you're concerned about me.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.375
But you left me in New York.

16:21.375 --> 16:22.416
Alone.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.666
And I was not okay.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.000
I'm sorry.

16:39.250 --> 16:40.500
I...

16:40.708 --> 16:42.291
I was confused.

16:46.250 --> 16:47.416
Scared.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.000
Where the hell am I?

18:42.875 --> 18:44.375
What are you doing?

18:44.833 --> 18:47.291
There's something going on...

18:48.166 --> 18:50.000
Chula can help you.

18:51.708 --> 18:53.291
Go on now.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.250
Want something to drink?

20:06.125 --> 20:06.958
There's pop.

20:07.166 --> 20:08.333
Let's stop pretending

20:08.333 --> 20:09.750
everything is normal.

20:13.083 --> 20:14.541
Fine.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.958
Here, sit.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.083
You tell me...

20:26.375 --> 20:28.291
what Henry thought

20:28.291 --> 20:31.166
was so important?

20:43.250 --> 20:45.541
There's something going on

20:45.541 --> 20:47.083
in my head.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.916
Sometimes, I feel like I'm losing it.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.166
Like dreams that come

20:52.166 --> 20:54.083
whether I'm asleep or not.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.916
The last twenty-four hours

20:55.916 --> 20:57.250
have been more...

20:57.458 --> 20:58.458
intense.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.375
Intense?

21:00.541 --> 21:01.625
How?

21:02.875 --> 21:04.458
Overwhelming.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.416
I'm seeing a bunch of people...

21:08.166 --> 21:11.041
I don't recognize,
in a place I've never been to before.

21:11.958 --> 21:15.583
How long has this been happening?

21:15.958 --> 21:17.916
Since I got to Tamaha.

21:18.916 --> 21:21.208
What are you seeing?

21:25.041 --> 21:27.291
A cave collapsing...

21:27.791 --> 21:28.708
And trees.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.125
A woman braiding her hair.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.625
What?

21:34.666 --> 21:36.750
Everything...

21:36.750 --> 21:39.833
...makes sense now.

21:41.333 --> 21:43.708
What you're describing...

21:44.666 --> 21:46.416
it's what I saw...

21:46.708 --> 21:48.333
on the night...

21:49.333 --> 21:51.375
I gave birth...

21:54.041 --> 21:56.375
to your mother.

21:57.791 --> 22:00.000
Doctors at the hospital

22:00.000 --> 22:02.208
found complications with my pregnancy.

22:03.333 --> 22:05.041
Me and the baby,

22:05.041 --> 22:06.500
your mother,

22:06.916 --> 22:08.541
we were both in danger.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.416
"It's in God's hands," they said.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.875
Against the doctor's orders,

22:16.500 --> 22:17.875
my family

22:17.875 --> 22:19.958
took me out of the white hospital.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.333
Brought me to a midwife...

22:24.541 --> 22:28.291
...where I could be
surrounded by my sisters.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.666
I could hardly say
they were always with me.

23:15.875 --> 23:20.625
They had an ability to know
when they were truly needed.

23:32.958 --> 23:36.041
That night with your mother and I...

23:36.041 --> 23:40.291
it was a life or death ordeal.

24:05.250 --> 24:08.458
Taloa came into this world and set about

24:08.458 --> 24:11.250
lifting the pain of others.

24:12.708 --> 24:14.583
She had a gift...

24:15.791 --> 24:17.750
...she was a healer.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.375
There's a unique...

24:23.125 --> 24:23.958
connection...

24:24.666 --> 24:25.666
between...

24:27.916 --> 24:30.166
a mother and her child.

24:33.208 --> 24:36.500
An unbreakable connection.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.166
When...

24:41.750 --> 24:43.666
your mother was killed...

24:45.541 --> 24:47.333
I...

24:48.166 --> 24:49.583
My heart...

24:50.875 --> 24:52.875
shattered.

24:54.375 --> 24:56.375
I wanted to die.

24:57.875 --> 24:58.916
You...

24:59.166 --> 25:01.208
You disowned me.

25:02.208 --> 25:03.125
No.

25:03.916 --> 25:05.458
Not you.

25:06.125 --> 25:08.125
Your father.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.541
I was angry.

25:10.708 --> 25:12.708
All I ever heard growing up

25:13.125 --> 25:14.458
from my dad was

25:14.833 --> 25:16.833
how you destroyed this family.

25:17.500 --> 25:19.250
How you wanted nothing to do with us.

25:19.833 --> 25:21.291
I couldn't...

25:22.166 --> 25:23.750
bear...

25:24.458 --> 25:25.958
to be around you.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.541
You're so much alike.

25:34.958 --> 25:38.041
And I think...

25:45.833 --> 25:47.791
generations are

25:47.791 --> 25:49.458
echoing...

25:53.708 --> 25:54.625
reaching out...

25:56.000 --> 25:57.250
to us.

26:00.916 --> 26:03.250
At a time when we...

26:04.791 --> 26:06.833
need them...

26:09.166 --> 26:10.416
the most.

26:12.458 --> 26:14.125
I was a child.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.083
I needed you.

26:24.541 --> 26:26.250
But you chose yourself!

26:36.208 --> 26:37.583
How did that go?

26:37.791 --> 26:39.708
I don't know, exhausting.

30:03.583 --> 30:05.041
My memories are a lie.

30:05.250 --> 30:06.708
A child's fantasy

30:06.708 --> 30:09.500
that turned a monster into a hero.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.875
You isolated me.

30:35.666 --> 30:36.875
Told me you

30:36.875 --> 30:38.708
were the only one I could trust.

30:38.833 --> 30:39.916
But it was all a lie.

30:40.291 --> 30:41.500
Even these contacts,

30:41.833 --> 30:43.041
you got them because

30:43.041 --> 30:45.125
you didn't care enough to learn to sign.

31:55.250 --> 31:57.916
That's how your father died?

31:58.416 --> 31:59.250
You...

31:59.250 --> 32:00.666
...killed him?

33:59.666 --> 34:01.625
I love you.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.708
I love you.
