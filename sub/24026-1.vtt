<i>Good evening! Sitting comfortably?</i>

00:51.718 --> 00:54.552
<i>I hope you didn't scarf all the ice cream</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:58.970
<i>and you left some for your friend
otherwise you won't get any today.</i>

00:59.268 --> 01:01.510
<i>Before the real story begins,</i>

01:01.645 --> 01:03.728
<i>let's travel back in time</i>

01:03.897 --> 01:05.308
<i>to the 90s.</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:09.021
<i>The good old days of tape recorders,</i>

01:09.236 --> 01:13.196
<i>tasteful tramp-stamps
and massive blow-dried hairdos.</i>

01:13.365 --> 01:17.575
<i>There's one now! That's Nurse Christa.</i>

01:17.911 --> 01:20.904
<i>Hello baby Anabel,
we'll get to you in a minute.</i>

01:21.123 --> 01:24.787
<i>And there's Nurse Manuela,
the one who's had an investment tip:</i>

01:25.127 --> 01:27.665
<i>a friend of a friend's cousin</i>

01:28.005 --> 01:30.668
<i>and her sister's sister-in-law
and a friend of hers</i>

01:30.799 --> 01:32.756
<i>sent a chain letter</i>

01:33.135 --> 01:36.754
<i>instructing people to send money
to anonymous recipients</i>

01:36.888 --> 01:40.802
<i>so anonymous people send
much more money back to you and then,</i>

01:41.143 --> 01:42.884
<i>goodbye empty bank account!</i>

01:43.228 --> 01:46.642
<i>How does it work again?
Who transfers how much to whom?</i>

01:47.274 --> 01:50.108
How should I know?
The point is it's anonymous.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.779
That's the coolest!
But why don't more people do it?

01:55.032 --> 01:58.571
It would end poverty!
- The letter says "everybody wins."

01:58.869 --> 02:01.737
<i>Come on Nurse Christa, get it together.</i>

02:01.913 --> 02:05.623
<i>Oh, just to lie on the beach
and never have to work again!</i>

02:05.959 --> 02:08.747
<i>I'll do it Manuela!
- That's more like it!</i>

04:19.760 --> 04:22.503
Get up Anabel, we have an appointment.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.761
Yuck, a penis!

04:26.516 --> 04:29.350
I gave you 1,000 euros
to get up at 11 for once.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.144
Now it's 12.
- Trixi you're bleeding!

04:33.273 --> 04:36.766
Calm down. It's my new vampire facelift
from Dr Heidari.

04:37.152 --> 04:42.022
Oh, God, I thought you'd quit facelifts
after your butt cheeks went numb.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.283
Only the left one.
- But real people are happy too,

04:45.452 --> 04:47.284
even with droopy tits and fat butts.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.369
I wish I knew where you got
that brashness from!

04:58.048 --> 05:00.791
You do know this is a product of
factory farming?

05:01.301 --> 05:04.840
Everything's in it. Teeth, eyes, brain.
That can't taste good.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.429
Yes, it can. It tastes really nice.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.016
As long as the customer likes it

05:10.185 --> 05:12.802
and the food-production mafia
and Google get rich.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.601
There's no way Google made my liverwurst.
- Oh, yeah.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.266
They're all in it together. All of 'em.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.273
This shampoo won't work.
What I always do is

05:25.659 --> 05:29.278
beat an egg and
whip it together with mineral water.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.286
It's great, see.

05:31.873 --> 05:33.614
Forget about the shampoo.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.625
I'd like to buy it anyway if I may.
- No.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.578
Save yourself the 79 pfennigs.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.171
I'd like to see the manager.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.341
Mom, you'll get in trouble again.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.720
Sorry. Come on, I'll do it.

05:48.431 --> 05:51.094
It's no problem.
- Aura, I'll go grab lunch.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.977
You're called Aura, like aura?
- Yes.

05:55.480 --> 06:00.271
Aura Indira Madonna, to be exact.
You've met my mom.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.023
I'm Ingo.
- Hi.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.405
Oh, wow, you drive a Porsche?

06:08.034 --> 06:11.698
I've never been in anything like that,
I'm just a little checkout girl.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.832
Look, the princess is up!

06:17.377 --> 06:19.243
Shut it, tassel toes!

06:20.046 --> 06:22.038
Good morning, darling sister.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.794
Hello.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.094
Olivjeh Burberry-Devonshire,
public relations.

06:28.555 --> 06:32.265
Olivjeh with a "yeah!"
- Anabel with "ah."

06:34.394 --> 06:38.013
Olivjeh is here to suggest a charity
for our grand summer party

06:38.189 --> 06:40.351
to donate to when we enter the fray.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.645
Thanks Miss Trixi, I'll put it straight.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.396
Illiterates and AIDS
are already taken this summer.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.860
They're always first to go.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.780
That leaves male victims
of domestic violence.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.245
But they can be very aggressive.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.748
I fancy something a little more
fashionable.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.622
What about those transgender kids?

07:00.795 --> 07:03.629
Can we perhaps buy some breasts
for a little boy?

07:03.882 --> 07:06.090
That would be terribly moving!

07:06.426 --> 07:11.046
Of course, one day transgender will
overthrow AIDS, but we need a way in,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.468
a strong personal backstory.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.893
I'm always being asked
if I used to be a man.

07:17.270 --> 07:21.435
This is nuts. Let's take action
instead of always donating money.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.024
You just don't see the potential.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.109
You and I, we two,

07:26.363 --> 07:28.355
could be Germany's donation angels.

07:28.740 --> 07:32.450
But imagine if we went into the slums
and the ghettos

07:32.786 --> 07:35.278
and just helped out,
that'd be much better.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.285
I do actually have something like that,

07:38.625 --> 07:40.958
totally basic, teenage offenders.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.829
I suggest a photo-op with gangster kids,
then a locally-sourced

07:45.006 --> 07:46.793
organic-vegan buffet!

07:48.593 --> 07:50.835
Well, that sounds simply fantastic!

07:54.349 --> 07:57.513
But these kids, they're just offenders?

07:57.769 --> 07:59.761
Not in any way... handicapped?

08:02.357 --> 08:06.442
It's my lawyer. It's probably about that
damned stud-farm on Sylt. Hello?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.610
Just ignore her.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.481
We'll take handicapped criminals,
anything to help.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.781
What?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.320
Pardon?

08:15.078 --> 08:18.287
This is a prank call
from a TV show, right?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.081
Yes...

08:25.296 --> 08:27.128
Yes, I have a daughter.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.958
She's 25 years old.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.509
Ciao.
- Ciao.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.606
That's the third Porsche-dork
in ten days.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.897
Did you break up with the cop?
He was real nice.

08:53.158 --> 08:57.118
I've always been with Yann and still am.
You'd better not rat on me.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.244
Hey girls!
- Hi baby!

09:01.583 --> 09:06.248
Why are you already here?
Have you been here... the whole time?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.292
No, why?

09:10.759 --> 09:12.716
How's world peace?
- Okay.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.256
Come home, Mom's freaking out.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.595
I was swapped?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.761
We'll sue.

09:20.185 --> 09:24.395
Our lawyers will tear their balls out
and throw them to mangy street-dogs.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.893
Great, and then?
- We're not even related.

09:27.442 --> 09:31.311
No... I'd have noticed.
I... I love shopping,

09:31.821 --> 09:34.063
I love spas and partying,

09:34.365 --> 09:37.153
those are all signs that I belong here.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.111
Quick question: are we going with

09:40.455 --> 09:43.539
teenage offenders as our charity?
- Yes.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.621
And the food, local and vegan?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.543
Enough!

09:59.140 --> 10:01.553
You bet I'm your mother!

10:01.893 --> 10:06.638
I changed your diapers and fed you
and gave you my ideals.

10:08.066 --> 10:11.810
I carried you around
whenever you had a fever.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.895
And I bought you your first bicycle.

10:17.200 --> 10:22.241
You stole it,
and we had to run from the cops.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.322
It was a lovely bicycle.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.206
It is bad enough
that we have different dads.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.674
At least we're all Buddhists.

10:35.844 --> 10:38.086
Other families have it much worse,

10:38.888 --> 10:41.847
where one's a Catholic
or a Pegida supporter.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.342
I'm taking the DNA test.

10:45.270 --> 10:48.104
And you, too. We have to know.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.474
Oh God!
- We're out of cheese singles.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.606
What's up?
- Aura was swapped.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.738
And now we're not
a real family after all.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.908
That sucks.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.036
Hello Daddy.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.877
Do you think I can still call you Daddy?

11:14.841 --> 11:20.132
Now I'm pretty much just a stranger
whose butt you sometimes used to wipe.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.182
I don't even know where you are
all this time.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.724
Somewhere.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.360
Near God or Allah, maybe.

11:37.280 --> 11:40.864
Maybe you can influence the results
of the DNA test when I do it.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.614
Just give me a sign, okay?

11:49.667 --> 11:53.206
If you don't want me to be your daughter

11:55.006 --> 11:56.668
then simply...

12:02.555 --> 12:05.298
do a back-flip
and sing the national anthem.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.553
Okay?

12:38.174 --> 12:40.461
MATERNITY 99% UNLIKELY

12:45.473 --> 12:46.884
Oh my God!

13:02.031 --> 13:03.442
I'll get it!

13:05.702 --> 13:07.159
Hello.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.450
My daughter. There you are.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.743
Come in.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.456
Wow!

13:21.884 --> 13:24.046
Where's the television?

13:25.388 --> 13:27.220
Oh my God! Oh my God!

13:27.390 --> 13:29.052
She's like Grandmama!

13:29.183 --> 13:33.097
Come here my child.
You're beautiful! Just beautiful!

13:33.479 --> 13:36.438
Trixi was never that emotional
in our entire childhood!

13:36.607 --> 13:39.395
Come you two,
say a proper hello to your sister.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.395
Albrecht.
- Hi, Aura.

13:44.615 --> 13:45.822
Hello.
- I...

13:46.034 --> 13:47.991
I'm really happy to meet you all.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.242
You look like a picture-book family.
- It's always like a fairy tale here.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.874
Yes, and now we'll start from scratch,
all of us together.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.370
You know that technically
you're no longer my mother?

13:59.714 --> 14:01.125
Details!

14:01.466 --> 14:03.879
There's room for everyone! And now,

14:04.260 --> 14:05.842
a little champers!

14:06.262 --> 14:08.675
Real Champagne? Oh, wow!

14:09.098 --> 14:11.055
Crazy!
- Did you see that?

14:11.392 --> 14:13.429
We both clap our hands!

14:13.603 --> 14:16.186
Isn't genetic technology wild!

14:16.397 --> 14:20.232
Come my darling,
we'll go get you some lovely clothes.

14:20.568 --> 14:25.359
She can have the bedroom next to mine.
- Are you flirting? That's your sister!

14:26.032 --> 14:27.989
Idiot.
- I'll get the Champagne.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.195
Yes!

14:29.535 --> 14:32.869
It's so funny, me, little Anabel,
born into all this.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.826
Anabel von Schlacht.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.368
I'm Anabel, you're someone else entirely.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.372
I'm sorry, but... those are the facts.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.753
Technically she's right.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.966
Have you all gone nuts?
You can't just switch everything around.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.386
I have the most hilarious idea!

14:53.643 --> 14:58.138
You can both use the name.
Who says there can only be one?

14:59.399 --> 15:02.312
Now let's drink to a happy family!

15:02.652 --> 15:06.362
Cheers!
- And we'll find a lovely room for you.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.533
Hello? I don't even have a glass!

15:27.677 --> 15:29.384
Well, this sucks.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.433
Cheers ex-Daddy!

15:46.529 --> 15:48.236
Okay.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.822
Schlonz. Hello?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.995
Sweetie? Is it you?

16:02.670 --> 16:05.253
Do you want to come back? Hm?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.548
You know,

16:09.051 --> 16:10.667
in God's universe

16:11.179 --> 16:13.296
we two are related anyway.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.674
Nothing will change all that.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.510
Isn't it wonderful?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.346
If you don't want to say anything

16:22.982 --> 16:24.644
let's do an "om" together.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.876
What?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.963
Oh shit, she's crazy.

16:49.467 --> 16:51.379
I'm descended from a crazy.

16:52.136 --> 16:56.005
There's no way I'm meeting her,
but I don't have to, right?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.014
I'll just stay here.

17:00.728 --> 17:03.436
That's my grandfather?
- No, your father,

17:03.814 --> 17:07.979
Bolko von Schlacht. Age doesn't matter
in industry and aristocracy.

17:08.319 --> 17:12.063
That would unnecessarily reduce
the pool of eligible suitors.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.982
And now he's dead?
- Oh, no.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.904
He's been in a coma for ages.
He had a couple strokes.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.157
Aw, that was the day
my first milk-tooth fell out.

17:24.335 --> 17:26.748
I don't remember that at all.

17:27.128 --> 17:30.418
There's all sorts in this box of slides.
You know, Aura darling

17:30.800 --> 17:35.135
your family history is full of tradition
and very important people.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.137
Crazy!

17:40.351 --> 17:43.469
Yes, Aura, that's your lovely grandpa
with his cool tennis buddy.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.726
I'd think twice if I were you.
You can still go.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.442
Enough of that. He only visited once.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.696
And he was a bloody bad loser.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.998
Let's go, let's go!
I don't want to see anyone empty-handed!

18:05.376 --> 18:10.622
What's up with the Christmas decoration?
Put that shit away, damn it!

18:10.881 --> 18:14.545
For God's sake, I said this shitty poster
should be on the right

18:14.844 --> 18:16.801
when I'm facing this way.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.842
<i>What are you doing?
This looks like a Christmas bakery!</i>

18:23.060 --> 18:26.724
<i>Five minutes, people!
Over there, over there!</i>

18:30.234 --> 18:31.600
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

18:31.777 --> 18:33.609
<i>Three minutes, ladies and gents!</i>

18:33.779 --> 18:38.820
<i>Wonderful! The right flowers!
Pink and white. We can do it after all!</i>

18:40.995 --> 18:44.534
I feel like it's a relief for them all
that I don't belong.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.533
You know they think I'm a loser anyway.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.285
My useless mom
still managed four husbands.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.831
Yeah, because her doctor
tucked her skin behind her ears.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.799
She looks like a ferret in a wind tunnel.

18:58.721 --> 18:59.802
Listen,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.758
my new mom might be crazy.
Not a single Google entry.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.642
That's spooky!

19:06.020 --> 19:08.433
My dogs have 13,000 entries.
- I dunno.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.892
I should at least go see
where I'm from, right?

19:13.235 --> 19:15.443
Find out why I am like I am.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.197
No. You're Anabel,
and that's a good thing.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.036
Rawr!
- Huh?

19:27.208 --> 19:28.949
Oh my God, know who that is?
- Who?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.660
That's Ben Schwarz.
- Ben Schwarz?

19:32.129 --> 19:35.873
He invented all the internet ring tones.
And a whole bunch of stuff.

19:36.300 --> 19:40.135
He always wins "Founder of the Year."
- He's got the ass of the year!

19:40.971 --> 19:44.806
Hello stranger! Where you headed?
Come here often?

19:45.851 --> 19:48.468
We're so funny.
- Hi.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.562
Hi.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.108
Did you take flirting at night-school?

19:57.029 --> 19:58.315
Um, no...

19:59.281 --> 20:01.523
It's just you're in our driveway.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.859
Hi, I'm Anabel.

20:06.414 --> 20:11.785
Hi, I'm Mäusi Hochstädter,
of Hochstädter mall fame,

20:12.336 --> 20:13.952
you probably know them.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.871
Nice to meet you, Anabel.

20:16.090 --> 20:19.424
I have to make a few calls
but we'll see each other around.

20:20.261 --> 20:23.004
Yeah, we were about to leave anyway.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.130
Just when you said it.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.132
It's just you said it first.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.602
Let's go.
- Maybe we'll grab a champers later?

20:32.440 --> 20:34.727
Stop it.
- What's wrong?

20:35.276 --> 20:37.484
Oh God, now I looked back.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.232
Ciao!

20:41.240 --> 20:44.233
Good evening and welcome
to our summer party.

20:45.411 --> 20:48.028
Dear guests,
health is our most precious possession.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.741
And early screening can save lives.
- That's last year's speech!

20:53.169 --> 20:55.126
And breast cancer...
- Trixi!!

20:55.463 --> 20:57.170
...affects us all.
- Psst! Trixi!

20:57.631 --> 20:59.668
In three easy moves...
- Trixi, stop!

21:00.092 --> 21:02.550
Go up and stop her.
- ...the female breast...

21:02.845 --> 21:04.052
No!

21:04.388 --> 21:06.630
...can be checked at home. Like so.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.723
Trixi, don't do it.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.842
Give me the damn speech.

21:12.062 --> 21:14.145
Play some music!

21:14.440 --> 21:15.476
Music!

21:16.233 --> 21:17.349
One...

21:19.195 --> 21:21.278
Good evening,
let's hear it for the teens! -Applause!

21:24.158 --> 21:26.992
We're all gathered here
for a very special cause.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.987
Because children are our future!

21:30.331 --> 21:32.118
Bravo!
- Yes!

21:35.419 --> 21:37.581
Look at our socially deprived areas.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.248
There, there are no hopeful prospects

21:41.383 --> 21:43.420
only anger at the hopelessness

21:43.761 --> 21:47.971
but also the hope that everyone
should have a new, second life

21:48.516 --> 21:51.384
and a second chance.
That's exactly what I think!

21:51.894 --> 21:54.762
So, let us change something here today!

21:55.147 --> 21:56.729
Bravo!
- Wonderful!

22:01.111 --> 22:03.194
And for all of those

22:03.322 --> 22:06.235
who don't know it yet, this wonderful,

22:06.575 --> 22:08.407
exceptional young woman

22:09.078 --> 22:10.410
is my lost daughter.

22:11.121 --> 22:13.738
I can't imagine life without her
any more.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.000
Let's raise a toast

22:17.461 --> 22:19.293
to Aura von...

22:19.839 --> 22:23.503
No! To Anabel von Schlacht!

22:27.263 --> 22:28.674
Super!

23:31.702 --> 23:34.740
What? I didn't do anything!
- Me neither Johnny, I'm just bored.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.786
Hi.

23:54.892 --> 23:58.056
Is Barbie moving in, or what?
- Shut it.

23:59.355 --> 24:02.348
Excuse me. You're lost aren't you?

24:02.900 --> 24:06.268
No. Alles klar Herr Kommissar.
I'm just here visiting my... mother.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.065
You've run away from
the clinic next door, haven't you?

24:11.867 --> 24:15.201
I just told you, my mom lives here.
- Aha.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.826
You're just strolling in your bathrobe,
with a overnight bag.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.207
This is a joke, right? Bathrobe?

24:21.710 --> 24:23.702
It's a designer pajama-jacket.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.792
It's very nice.
Who is your mom and where does she live?

24:27.383 --> 24:29.466
The bell's over there.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.127
I think. I've never been here.

24:34.306 --> 24:38.220
You've never been to your mom's?
- Yes! My mom is Carmen Schlonz,

24:38.394 --> 24:40.556
I was swapped as a baby,
so this is my first visit.

24:41.355 --> 24:44.644
I did a DNA test.
Up till then I was a rich heiress,

24:45.567 --> 24:47.559
but now it'll all go to Aura Schlonz,

24:47.861 --> 24:50.399
Anabel 2. Whatever. I don't give a fuck.

24:50.572 --> 24:53.280
So, you see. I'm not crazy, got it?

24:53.492 --> 24:55.233
Aura Schlonz?
- Yes.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.239
Are you sure?
- Yes.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.704
Yes. She's living with my ex-mom now.

24:59.873 --> 25:01.114
Right.

25:03.961 --> 25:07.125
Schlonz, right. There we have it.
Who's the psycho now?

25:08.757 --> 25:10.965
<i>Hello?
- Rosa, it's Yann.</i>

25:11.135 --> 25:13.001
Kowalski. Can you open up please?

25:13.178 --> 25:16.171
<i>Mommy! Hide the cannabis
the police are here.</i>

25:28.110 --> 25:29.442
Wait!

25:30.404 --> 25:32.441
Are we really going up?

25:33.282 --> 25:36.025
This is an elevator.
They tend to do that.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.287
You okay?
- Yes.

25:42.499 --> 25:45.037
I'm guess I'm a little nervous, but I...

25:47.713 --> 25:49.670
I'll breathe through it.

25:50.299 --> 25:52.256
One... two...

25:53.469 --> 25:55.882
three... four...

25:59.475 --> 26:00.556
Five.

26:06.356 --> 26:09.895
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

26:11.987 --> 26:14.024
Oh, yeah, what was that about then?

26:16.575 --> 26:19.659
I have an under-active thyroid so,

26:19.870 --> 26:24.080
I got really dizzy for a moment.
I tipped forward for health reasons.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.625
Okay.
- I don't know why I'm justifying myself.

26:28.045 --> 26:33.541
Exactly. Nothing happened.
- "Nothing" isn't entirely correct either.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.092
True. You stared at me.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.547
This elevator is 3cm wide.
I have to look at your weird face.

26:40.682 --> 26:44.676
My weird face?
- Yes, you have tiny ears. Much too small.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.186
I don't, I...
- Really tiny ears.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.271
Totally crazy.

26:50.150 --> 26:52.563
Thank you. Now I know.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.083
It's about the
Autonomous Animal Front, right?

27:10.420 --> 27:13.504
Ah, no, Mrs Schlonz. It's...

27:14.091 --> 27:16.458
This woman claims to be your daughter.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.087
Hello.
- There you are!

27:20.681 --> 27:24.391
My child, my swapped one. Come here.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.510
Oh, man...

27:28.772 --> 27:31.856
You even came running in your bathrobe.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.564
What's your name?

27:35.988 --> 27:38.230
Anabel.
- Welcome.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.901
Come on in.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.859
Last one in closes the door.

27:44.079 --> 27:48.119
Now come and see
who I've brought along with me.

27:50.878 --> 27:52.460
Hi.
- Hi, I'm Rosa,

27:52.796 --> 27:55.664
named after the great socialist
freedom-fighter Rosa Luxemburg.

27:55.799 --> 27:58.086
And that's my brother Siddharta.
- Call me Sid.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.673
It's less embarrassing.
- I'm Anabel.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.092
And where is Aura?

28:03.807 --> 28:06.971
She's with her super, new luxury family.
You know how she is.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.472
Cool, police.

28:10.022 --> 28:14.517
Avoid the bathroom for 30-40 minutes
if you have a sensitive nose.

28:15.319 --> 28:19.438
Don't worry, he's not your dad.
That's Gernot, our lodger.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.108
Gernot, take a look at my daughter.

28:23.452 --> 28:26.490
Hi, I'll just stay seated.
I can't get too excited.

28:26.830 --> 28:29.322
I'm a depressive early retiree.
- That's nice.

28:29.499 --> 28:32.788
To meet you, I mean, not the depression.
- Yeah.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.415
Look at us standing around
like lost souls.

28:39.176 --> 28:42.214
I'll be going, then.
Have fun settling in.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.591
Bye!
- Oh, and...

28:44.890 --> 28:48.054
I hope you don't mind, but we smoke pot.

28:48.518 --> 28:51.056
They'll all have wrecked brain-cells.

28:51.480 --> 28:54.393
And I thought my old family was nuts.

28:58.695 --> 29:01.233
Hello.
- You come home right now.

29:01.406 --> 29:04.069
I am home. With my real mom
if you must know.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.404
It's great.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.491
You don't even know this woman.
- What can I say?

29:09.915 --> 29:12.407
It was love at first sight,
we're having a ball, Trixi,

29:12.751 --> 29:14.959
I never had such a good time!

29:15.337 --> 29:16.794
Coming! I'm on a call!

29:16.964 --> 29:21.004
I wonder how much they'll love
your 40,000 euro clothes bills.

29:21.134 --> 29:23.501
They don't care about money,
not like you.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.383
You can't live without money.

29:26.556 --> 29:30.391
You're worse than any Saudi prince.
- I can do fine without you.

29:30.686 --> 29:33.019
I don't need all your damned money.

29:33.438 --> 29:38.103
Hear me cut up your damn credit cards!
- Gather the bits up.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.523
In exactly one week,
you'll be here begging.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.313
No. I'll look for a job.

29:43.699 --> 29:47.283
With your junior-high education?
- If you don't mind,

29:47.703 --> 29:51.492
I'm off to spend time with the nicest,
sweetest, funniest family in the world!

29:58.630 --> 30:00.212
I'm so exhausted.

30:00.674 --> 30:03.508
I'd like to go up and lie down. Upstairs?

30:05.178 --> 30:07.295
The Öztürks live upstairs.

30:10.851 --> 30:11.967
Right.

30:12.227 --> 30:14.970
Good night.
- I'm still reading. Good night!

30:15.147 --> 30:16.809
Good night!
- Night! -Good night!

30:21.320 --> 30:22.902
Ah, that's nice.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.277
Lights out?
- Hm.

30:38.128 --> 30:40.165
Carmen?
- Yeah?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.751
Who is my dad?

30:46.636 --> 30:48.798
Do you know what Tantric sex is?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.718
Group sex with tree-huggers.
- No.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.681
When I was young, I went to India.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.221
There were always parties.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.143
It was electric.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.184
Sometimes,

31:02.486 --> 31:05.604
you didn't quite know who was inside you.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.623
Just give me a shove if I snore.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.459
Anabella.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.250
Anabella.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.549
Anabella, please look.

32:56.975 --> 33:00.594
What's that supposed to be?
- I knew you'd be as scared as Rosa.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.596
Oh no.
- What?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.272
Do I have to
go to the fur-shop demo again?

33:05.567 --> 33:09.402
Not if you don't want a
fairer world, my child.

33:10.530 --> 33:13.739
We already went to anti-globalization
and female genital mutilation.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.616
I'm allowed to miss this one.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.819
But you're coming?

33:19.247 --> 33:21.910
To those jerks Behringer Furs on Ku'damm.
- No.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.831
All my friends shop there,
we're regulars.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.706
Are we going now?
My happy pills only last four hours.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.881
Wait up, my car!

33:39.768 --> 33:42.681
My car was right here yesterday.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.066
Oh my God,
that's the last thing I have from dad.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.108
Hey, are you crazy, that's mine!

33:54.699 --> 33:57.737
Oh great, that was my breakfast.
- I don't give a shit.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.236
You owe me a euro.
- Who stole my car?

34:01.790 --> 34:04.157
Mornin' Ralf,
need something in your belly?

34:04.709 --> 34:07.247
Breakfast beer
is the most important of the day.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.745
I'll get it. Anabel, got a euro?

34:10.130 --> 34:11.996
Yann! Hello!

34:12.342 --> 34:15.176
Police! We need someone competent!

34:17.556 --> 34:19.592
I can't hear you, I have tiny ears!

34:21.768 --> 34:24.476
So, on the hood,
a pink diamanté cannabis leaf.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.020
Doors: pink cannabis leaves.

34:27.607 --> 34:28.973
Diamanté. Tasteful.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.147
Plus nine Louis Voey-ton travel bags.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.025
And the license plate?

34:35.739 --> 34:38.447
No idea. But it's called Mr. Norris!

34:39.578 --> 34:41.661
Mr Norris? Perhaps he'll call us.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.743
Perhaps the plate is "SEXY"
without the E.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.708
Or "LADY" without the A, or just "BITCH."

34:48.878 --> 34:50.460
Like with most pink-car-chicks.

34:51.047 --> 34:53.414
The diamanté isn't pink it's baby-rose.

34:53.632 --> 34:56.216
It's ironic. I'm not some dumb airhead.

34:56.386 --> 34:59.800
I get it. My job's ironic too.
I'm really Superman.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.849
Oh, right, you're saying
I talk in dumb clichés.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.227
But I've got both feet on the ground.
More than you.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.307
Okay...

35:09.316 --> 35:12.809
How much is a pack of butter?
- Um... that depends.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.603
Four... ninety-nine.

35:16.406 --> 35:19.240
Truffle-butter costs ten more.
- What are gross and net?

35:19.993 --> 35:21.825
Those are definitely wages.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.700
Gross is for bosses, net for employees,

35:25.165 --> 35:28.374
it's less and they are definitely
different currencies.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.623
Name the Kardashians.
- Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, Kendall, Kylie.

35:32.339 --> 35:36.208
Right?
- No idea. You fit the cliché 100%.

35:36.593 --> 35:37.549
Funny.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.302
I hope the police will find my car,

35:40.639 --> 35:44.178
but I doubt it, 'cause some cops
would rather be smart-asses.

35:48.188 --> 35:51.181
I have to go, I'm busy looking for a job.
- Ooh!

35:51.358 --> 35:53.816
Is it a make-up tutorial on YouTube?
- No.

35:54.027 --> 35:57.611
I have several inter... views.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.236
With very big companies.
- Okay, only...

36:01.409 --> 36:05.119
if these global corporations
turn out to be an illusion,

36:05.497 --> 36:07.705
just try the temping agency

36:08.124 --> 36:10.161
next door.
- Thanks for the tip.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.871
Good luck!

36:24.641 --> 36:27.850
An unpaid internship?
Is that supposed to be a joke?

36:28.311 --> 36:31.600
What do you mean "high-school diploma"?
A chimp could do this.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.392
I don't mean you!

36:33.733 --> 36:36.100
No, no that came out all wrong.

36:36.277 --> 36:39.020
Kids excite me, but not sexually!
That's illegal.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.484
And even if it wasn't I wouldn't.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.656
Hi there!

36:51.543 --> 36:53.125
I'm Anabel.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.412
Hello, I'm Simone Fubel.

36:56.589 --> 37:00.128
I'm so excited. My first interview.
Wish me luck!

37:00.593 --> 37:04.052
May I offer you a little schnapps
to calm your nerves?

37:04.597 --> 37:06.088
Yes! Please!

37:08.810 --> 37:11.974
Do you have an ashtray?
- It's a no-smoking office.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.269
Okay.

37:14.816 --> 37:16.432
Cheers.

37:20.196 --> 37:23.815
That's better.
- Tell me something about your career.

37:26.035 --> 37:31.656
I went to Salem Castle boarding school
but before that I went to Eton.

37:32.083 --> 37:36.168
That was super-hard. Then Switzerland...
- You went to such good schools?

37:36.713 --> 37:41.378
Yeah, I got kicked out of Eton real fast.
- Why?

37:42.260 --> 37:45.344
Oh, yes, it was...

37:45.722 --> 37:49.306
...dumb. We borrowed the polo ponies
and rode them into town.

37:49.684 --> 37:53.473
We got a bit drunk
and suddenly the village bar blew up.

37:53.897 --> 37:59.188
On the whole I hate hierarchies.
I despise being told what to do.

38:01.112 --> 38:05.482
What was your last job?
- Well... up until now...

38:05.617 --> 38:07.984
actually, none. But I'm so into it.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.118
I mean, I'm almost 26.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.247
I think I can take the leap
and get a job.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.165
Yes, well...

38:15.502 --> 38:17.664
Thank you for the interview,

38:18.463 --> 38:21.376
it was very interesting to meet you.
- No way, that's it?

38:22.050 --> 38:26.340
That went well, didn't it?
I'm so relieved.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.548
We'll be in touch.
- When? Do I have a job now?

38:31.226 --> 38:33.718
I'd say that the chances
of you getting a job

38:33.895 --> 38:38.890
are about as good as my chances of
having group-sex with George Clooney.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.068
INCOMING CALL YANN

38:44.531 --> 38:45.647
Fuck.

38:50.745 --> 38:54.238
SORRY LOST MY VOICE! COUGH!

38:56.292 --> 38:58.909
Yuck,
I definitely need ketchup with that.

38:59.796 --> 39:02.004
This is so lovely!

39:02.590 --> 39:03.876
Oh, honeybuns!

39:04.050 --> 39:06.417
This is the best day of my life. Look!

39:06.594 --> 39:08.677
Right on the cover. The two of us.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.505
"Germany's Donation Angels." My God.

39:11.683 --> 39:15.643
How long have I dreamed of this?
- Your tennis club magazine?

39:16.104 --> 39:17.811
Who shall we help next?

39:19.190 --> 39:20.476
Dolphins!
- Yes!

39:20.859 --> 39:23.476
Or... what do you call them...?

39:23.653 --> 39:25.485
Refugees!
- Yes!

39:25.655 --> 39:28.272
Let's go shopping,
it always helps me think.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.733
That's a fabulous idea.

39:35.790 --> 39:38.498
Hello?
- It's Yann. What shop did your mom go to?

39:55.393 --> 39:58.136
Can we put the siren on?
Please, my day sucked.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.054
No.
- Okay. Can I drive?

40:00.648 --> 40:02.765
I promise not to break anything.

40:03.359 --> 40:07.228
Who is she again?
- Dunno. She escaped from the nut house.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.318
MURDERERS

40:15.038 --> 40:16.495
FUR IS MURDER

40:16.831 --> 40:21.246
<i>Hear our cries! Feel our pain!</i>

40:21.711 --> 40:24.875
<i>Hear our cries! Feel our pain!</i>

40:25.548 --> 40:28.507
I don't see what
all the fuss is about. I mean...

40:28.801 --> 40:31.134
the mink is a farm animal, isn't it?

40:31.346 --> 40:35.010
<i>Naturellement!
The mink gives us its cuddly fur.</i>

40:35.475 --> 40:37.512
Yes! Yes...

40:43.733 --> 40:45.144
Oh, God!

40:47.236 --> 40:49.193
FUR IS MURDER

40:50.239 --> 40:54.449
Everyone step back now!
- Hear our cries! Feel our pain!

41:00.708 --> 41:02.165
Beautiful!

41:02.752 --> 41:04.869
Just like me when I was flat-chested.

41:05.129 --> 41:08.167
Should I have them done?
- Darling, it's dead simple,

41:08.508 --> 41:10.420
those with money also have breasts.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.011
Hear our cries! Feel our pain!

41:14.555 --> 41:17.889
Hear our cries! Feel our pain!

41:19.394 --> 41:22.478
Daughter's being spoiled today.
I hope the other daughter,

41:22.772 --> 41:25.515
Anabel? Won't be jealous.
- Um, Anabel...

41:25.692 --> 41:27.979
No, she's on vacation.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.652
Indefinitely.
- Great! The Maldives again?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.400
No.

41:32.865 --> 41:36.233
I have to say it, Anabel has run away.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.077
Just like that, as if we never existed.

41:39.789 --> 41:42.577
But there's more.
She never even was my daughter.

41:43.251 --> 41:45.368
Isn't that totally amusing?

41:45.712 --> 41:48.750
She's just a group of lousy genes
with lousy character.

41:49.090 --> 41:51.173
And I'm delighted she's gone.

41:52.635 --> 41:56.629
Please bring me the white mink with bobbles.
- At once. Susi!

41:57.056 --> 41:58.638
White bobble mink, now!

42:02.478 --> 42:04.561
Damn, I wanted to buy that!
- Hey, fox!

42:04.981 --> 42:07.439
Fox, stop! Fox, you asshole!

42:08.359 --> 42:11.568
Not so fast,
let's see what idiot this is.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.189
It just came over me.
- What are you doing?

42:15.491 --> 42:20.782
I do you a favor and bring you
to meet your mom and you pull this shit?

42:21.080 --> 42:25.290
I'm having a hard time, does that count?
- Oh, really, I'm so sorry.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.208
Thanks.
- Of course not.

42:27.545 --> 42:29.582
To the station!
- Like a criminal?

42:29.881 --> 42:31.292
Yes, a criminal!

42:31.632 --> 42:34.090
I'm innocent! I've done nothing!

42:38.097 --> 42:40.134
Anabel...

42:42.518 --> 42:45.226
Criminal damage. A totaled Ferrari.

42:45.521 --> 42:49.105
Drunk driving.
Growing hemp on public property.

42:49.442 --> 42:51.183
Civil disorder.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.398
You're shocked now, eh?

42:54.781 --> 42:58.149
Sometimes I gotta stick it
to this fat consumer society.

42:58.451 --> 43:01.444
That's not your file, Mrs Schlonz,
it's Anabel's.

43:03.372 --> 43:06.536
And of course "prostitution." What?
- It was a bet.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.077
And me?

43:10.588 --> 43:12.170
I'm wanted.

43:12.632 --> 43:14.749
Because of the Autonomous Animal Front.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.751
Not to be confused with
Eco Front 2000, they're idiots.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.506
Eco-wimps.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.724
You're not in here.
And the fur-store case

43:24.102 --> 43:27.686
will probably be dropped because
it's so minor, so no worries.

43:28.022 --> 43:30.139
Yes!
- I don't mean you.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.777
There's really nothing about me in there?

43:36.656 --> 43:37.863
Isn't that great?

43:41.035 --> 43:42.446
Great...

43:43.496 --> 43:46.455
You fight for decades
for a better world...

43:48.751 --> 43:51.164
and the world's wearing earphones

43:52.130 --> 43:54.668
with noise reduction. Excuse me, I...

43:56.175 --> 43:58.383
I feel kind of dizzy.

43:58.553 --> 44:00.135
Take a break.

44:00.304 --> 44:03.342
Let's get chocolate
from the machine, you like that.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.427
Oh, God, those two are so sweet somehow.

44:08.729 --> 44:12.097
She's really upset.
- I feel bad for them, too.

44:17.738 --> 44:20.025
How good are you at lying?
- Good.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.900
Frau Schlonz, you're under arrest.

44:23.369 --> 44:26.077
We found the file.
How did you hide so long?

44:26.414 --> 44:28.827
Oh my God, Carmen, you're under arrest!

44:29.041 --> 44:32.876
Arrest me. You can't stop me thinking!

44:33.254 --> 44:36.838
You're a dangerous radical!
I'll see to it you're put behind bars.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.505
See you in an hour for questions.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.973
What sort of cell was that?
- Our cleaning room.

44:46.851 --> 44:50.640
I'll leave her there and go get her
in an hour when my shift ends anyway.

44:51.063 --> 44:53.305
What will you tell her?

44:53.441 --> 44:57.355
I'll say that she has powerful friends
in the animal protection scene

44:57.486 --> 45:00.024
and we had to drop all charges.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.698
But seriously,

45:03.868 --> 45:05.575
the fur-store called.

45:05.745 --> 45:09.113
They're going to press charges
for 20,000 euros in damages.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.205
What? 20,000 euros?

45:11.542 --> 45:15.331
How can I pay? I'm broke.
- Right, but they'll get it somehow.

45:15.504 --> 45:17.871
They might even garnish your mom's wages.

45:18.090 --> 45:20.753
Oh, shit, they'll be finished.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.510
Oh, fuck, I didn't want this.

45:24.513 --> 45:26.220
I'll think of something.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.517
Shit.

45:31.020 --> 45:32.386
Get out, stain!

45:33.731 --> 45:35.893
Here, these are my nicest things.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.604
This is romantic.
- Wow!

45:39.153 --> 45:41.065
Or cool.
- Very cool.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.313
Very chic. Isn't this lovely?

45:44.700 --> 45:46.316
Know something, Rosa?

45:47.078 --> 45:50.571
You're really cool.
You're the coolest girl I know.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.531
Where are you going?

45:52.667 --> 45:55.000
To pick up Porsche-dorks like Aura?

46:01.300 --> 46:02.381
Hi!

46:02.843 --> 46:04.050
Oh.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.092
That's all I got.

46:08.474 --> 46:10.557
20 euros is too much
for this hit-parade brothel.

46:23.739 --> 46:25.822
Hi girls!
- Sweet T-shirt.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.032
Hi darling.
- Hi.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.736
Hello darling!

46:31.747 --> 46:33.784
I thought you'd gone,

46:34.125 --> 46:38.085
to those... those... people.
- I missed you all!

46:39.380 --> 46:42.498
Is that a kids' T-shirt?
- No.

46:43.676 --> 46:45.087
Okay, yes.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.177
You're so crazy,

46:48.889 --> 46:50.130
Oh, fuck.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.887
Bennie took my credit card to snort coke.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.219
Can you just pay for this?

46:57.064 --> 46:59.306
No. You're poor now.
- Yes.

46:59.483 --> 47:01.645
It's okay, I'll drink tap-water.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.274
That shit always falls out.

47:06.907 --> 47:09.775
Mäusi, I have an important question...
- Keep the change.

47:09.910 --> 47:13.369
Your father has those malls.
- Yes.

47:13.706 --> 47:16.790
Can I perhaps... work for him?

47:21.797 --> 47:23.379
Mäusi.
- Yes?

47:23.674 --> 47:26.007
I need a job urgently. Anything.
- Yes.

47:26.385 --> 47:28.342
Talk to Minzi. Minzi!

47:28.679 --> 47:31.296
Our party animal needs a job from you.

47:31.807 --> 47:36.051
Can you help me get on my feet?
I need a job. Anything.

47:36.395 --> 47:38.261
You are so funny. Really.

47:38.439 --> 47:40.806
Is your top really from a dime-store?

47:42.902 --> 47:44.188
Lili?

47:49.367 --> 47:50.778
Thanks.

47:52.578 --> 47:53.614
Anabel!

47:54.038 --> 47:57.406
Hey, I, um...
I heard right now you're having...

47:57.750 --> 48:00.208
some kind of a bad run?

48:00.753 --> 48:03.666
Did you come to be mean, too?
Go ahead, join the club.

48:04.382 --> 48:06.749
Sure. I'm mostly mean to people.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.420
You want a job or not?

48:08.719 --> 48:11.382
What, really? Working for you?

48:11.680 --> 48:13.467
Crazy! I'll do any...

48:13.724 --> 48:17.513
First you have to come for an interview
and get a good assessment.

48:20.898 --> 48:23.606
It was nice to see you.
- Ciao.

48:29.115 --> 48:31.983
What kind of job?
Don't mess me around, okay?

48:35.621 --> 48:37.237
Whoa there.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.413
What?
- Two euros. Hat check.

48:43.504 --> 48:44.836
You're welcome.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.887
Hello, Daddy.

49:37.266 --> 49:38.973
Did you miss me?

49:54.116 --> 49:55.823
Do you still remember

49:56.619 --> 50:00.283
how you always used to say
I'm the cleverest girl in the world?

50:01.081 --> 50:03.243
And I can do anything.

50:04.752 --> 50:07.119
I don't think that's true, Daddy.

50:08.214 --> 50:10.331
In reality, I can't do anything.

50:20.893 --> 50:23.636
I'm glad you're not here to see it.

50:38.536 --> 50:40.323
Want a drag?

50:41.372 --> 50:43.034
Sorry, go ahead.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.873
Where were my manners?

50:59.139 --> 51:03.179
Does this Botox Bubonic plague wear off
or will it stay like this forever?

51:04.186 --> 51:06.428
Hello? What's wrong with you?

51:07.898 --> 51:10.982
I was just thinking about
how Anabel and I

51:11.360 --> 51:13.727
always criticized each other.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.903
It's making me feel strange.

51:16.115 --> 51:18.528
My therapist says it's sadness.

51:18.784 --> 51:22.573
But I think it's because
my pill bottle is empty.

51:23.789 --> 51:28.534
That's probably Dr Heidari
with the opiates.

51:34.633 --> 51:37.216
Did you order yourself a stripper?

51:43.434 --> 51:45.642
What are you doing here?

51:47.062 --> 51:50.601
Are you really wearing a crown?
- A diadem, it's the family's.

51:51.984 --> 51:55.193
I brought you cough syrup,
but you don't need it, do you?

51:55.487 --> 51:58.104
Is there Codeine in it?
If so, I'll take it!

51:58.407 --> 52:01.115
Thank you.
- Um, Yann...

52:01.702 --> 52:03.409
I was going to call you

52:03.746 --> 52:05.237
and visit you, but...

52:05.581 --> 52:08.039
But you didn't want to?
- No, no...

52:08.208 --> 52:10.746
It's gotten complicated because, I mean,

52:11.086 --> 52:13.328
I'm way better off now

52:13.672 --> 52:16.335
and it's not that
I can't be with a cop, but

52:16.759 --> 52:20.378
of course we belong to
two different classes,

52:20.554 --> 52:22.295
but you were always there for me

52:22.806 --> 52:26.345
even back in school and that matters.
- Okay, stop that.

52:26.769 --> 52:28.886
Call me when you're back to normal.

52:30.439 --> 52:32.726
Stoiber, where's the robber?

52:35.194 --> 52:37.436
This is terrible. You couldn't know,

52:37.655 --> 52:41.615
but when you're rich it's also a burden.
Would you be so kind?

52:42.660 --> 52:45.573
Go and see which robber
has honored us this time.

52:45.746 --> 52:48.489
Keep it.
I get your tax-money. I'll go look.

52:49.958 --> 52:51.950
Stoiber... taxes?

52:58.717 --> 53:00.333
Ssh!

53:00.761 --> 53:03.424
It was just an open window.
I'm taking off.

53:11.063 --> 53:12.770
Down. Motion sensor.

53:22.116 --> 53:25.200
Oh, my God, are there drugs in this?
I don't use drugs.

53:25.411 --> 53:28.904
Relax, it's personal use.
- Thanks for not ratting on me.

53:31.125 --> 53:34.084
I've caught the robber now.
- Do I have to go to jail?

53:34.878 --> 53:36.710
I don't know, maybe...

53:38.048 --> 53:40.210
we can come to an agreement.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.636
Asshole!

53:50.811 --> 53:52.473
Seriously? Your girlfriend?

53:52.813 --> 53:54.429
Acting horny, for that?

53:54.732 --> 53:56.394
I'm not horny.

53:56.483 --> 53:58.475
Maybe you are. I get that.

53:58.610 --> 54:00.351
It was a joke.

54:06.869 --> 54:09.031
A ride home would be a good apology.

54:09.329 --> 54:11.241
Now you're playing dictator?

54:11.999 --> 54:16.710
Oh, too bad. I think the last bus
just left. It'll be a long walk.

54:18.130 --> 54:19.462
Yes?

54:19.840 --> 54:21.706
Okay, we can make her jealous.

54:22.050 --> 54:24.633
I can't stand her anyway.
But find my car.

54:24.887 --> 54:28.631
Your car's stolen, I'm not a magician.
- At least try, okay?

54:29.850 --> 54:31.432
Deal.
- Deal.

54:32.227 --> 54:36.437
You know, next time just lift that knob.
It's much easier.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.200
About that job interview again,

54:49.536 --> 54:51.448
at Benjamin Schwarz's firm.
- Carmen!

54:51.747 --> 54:54.160
I can help you prepare.
- I'm showering!

54:54.500 --> 54:58.961
Yeah, I know.
If anyone's the expert, it's me.

54:59.588 --> 55:02.422
I've been fired so often
I'm always doing interviews.

55:02.758 --> 55:04.875
She'd never fall for the schnapps!

55:05.093 --> 55:06.129
True.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.803
For the 100th time,
she offered me the schnapps.

55:10.015 --> 55:14.134
It's scientifically proven that 80%
of likability is judged on the hello.

55:14.353 --> 55:17.812
I always put on my most interested smile.

55:18.273 --> 55:21.186
I don't like the idea of sucking-up.

55:21.693 --> 55:25.733
It's only on the outside, yeah?
I'm dead on the inside.

55:26.114 --> 55:27.446
Shit.

55:28.408 --> 55:31.492
I'm shit-scared.
I'm underqualified and stupid.

55:31.870 --> 55:33.987
All I did in school was smoke weed.

55:34.122 --> 55:36.455
Oh, sweet-cakes, don't worry.

55:36.792 --> 55:39.751
That's just your bipolar womb talking.

55:40.671 --> 55:43.254
Our whole family has it. You'll manage.

55:43.757 --> 55:48.092
So how's our little schnapps guzzler?
- How could she know? She used to be rich.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.045
That's Anabel's toothbrush.

55:51.348 --> 55:53.340
Yeah? I've been using it ages.

55:53.642 --> 55:55.634
Can't you all see I'm showering?

55:56.061 --> 55:57.552
Yes, we're not blind.

55:57.896 --> 55:59.478
Hurry up, I want in.

56:34.558 --> 56:35.674
Mr Sackbrot?

56:36.393 --> 56:38.225
Yes?
- Pleased to meet you.

56:38.395 --> 56:40.762
I'm Anabel Schlonz,
here for my interview.

56:41.356 --> 56:44.099
Feel free to ask me anything.
I'm very driven.

56:46.445 --> 56:48.186
Can you speak German?

56:49.031 --> 56:51.318
I'm speaking to you now.

56:52.826 --> 56:55.819
I need your tax ID.
You know the pay isn't good?

56:57.581 --> 56:59.914
Does that mean I have the job?
- Yes.

57:00.959 --> 57:02.040
Yes! Yes!

57:04.379 --> 57:05.540
Cool!

57:07.424 --> 57:09.006
When can I start?

58:33.093 --> 58:36.006
Oh, God, I wasn't asleep, I was thinking.

58:37.514 --> 58:38.800
Okay, I was asleep.

58:41.101 --> 58:45.596
I hope you don't mind cleaning for me,
I thought it was better than nothing.

58:46.606 --> 58:50.270
One thing, I didn't know what to put
in the dishwasher so I used shampoo.

58:51.028 --> 58:52.564
See, everyjob has

58:52.696 --> 58:54.528
management decisions.

58:56.575 --> 58:58.407
You opened my forbidden cupboard.

58:59.745 --> 59:02.453
I didn't know.
Sorry, the door just came open.

59:02.622 --> 59:05.080
I'm mega-discreet. I'll never talk about

59:05.417 --> 59:06.999
what I saw.
- No, never.

59:08.503 --> 59:09.994
You're talking now.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.163
Fuck...

59:12.632 --> 59:13.839
Shit.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.338
Am I fired? Please don't fire me.

59:16.720 --> 59:20.555
I need 20,000 euros urgently.
Or, at least, 20 for now.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.058
Oh, well...

59:25.187 --> 59:27.395
And were you shocked by what you saw?

59:30.567 --> 59:33.275
No way, a few whips and nipple clamps...

59:33.361 --> 59:36.274
I mean, who doesn't want to be
well and truly fucked?

59:37.074 --> 59:38.736
I'll give you another chance.

59:39.159 --> 59:41.276
Come tomorrow and wash the windows.

59:41.787 --> 59:43.369
If you do badly...

59:47.626 --> 59:51.210
Sorry, it's just you looked so scared.

59:51.546 --> 59:53.082
I couldn't resist.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:04.761
I love you, too.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:23.113
Oh my God, you found Mr Norris!

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:27.405
Did you call for the limousine, madam?
- Yes. That was me.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.371
Are you the chauffeur, sir?
- That's me.

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:33.457
Want to go on a little after-work drive?
- Sure!

01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:37.298
That's what all cleaning ladies dream of.
- Is that so?

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:39.842
What great service!

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.313
She's posted her location.

01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:25.072
So we'll happen by. Right?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:30.991
You might want to get dressed up,
or it'll be hard to make her jealous.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:35.249
You kidding me? This is all I got.
Take it or leave it.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.871
Cheers, girls!

01:02:38.213 --> 01:02:40.079
They're still here.

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:44.630
Hello!
- Hi, how are you?

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:47.170
Oh, darling!

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:49.756
There.
- Thanks.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:53.347
What are they doing here?
- A bottle of Champagne please.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:55.728
Are you nuts?

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:57.433
I'm being cheery.

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:01.730
It's working.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:03.985
The Champagne and a beer.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.608
Champagne?

01:03:05.991 --> 01:03:09.280
Now take your billy club
out of your butt and act like

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.620
I'm hilarious
and she'll be here in under a minute.

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:16.957
That's so dumb!
- Nonsense.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:20.832
Oh, God, you stink.
- You do too.

01:03:21.339 --> 01:03:24.798
They seem crazy about each other.
He's hot for a cop.

01:03:25.176 --> 01:03:26.792
Are they kissing?

01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.628
That's it!

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.047
Don't be nasty, you know I hate blood.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:33.386
Oh, I like to see blood.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:36.055
She's coming.

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:38.349
I am sorry.

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:41.106
No worries. You look good.
- Hi, Aura.

01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:44.690
This is what you've been up to?
- We got a little distracted.

01:03:44.863 --> 01:03:45.979
Right sweetie?

01:03:46.197 --> 01:03:47.187
Sure.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:51.359
Where are my manners? Want a drink?
- No thanks, we're off to Hermes.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.361
You probably mean Hermès.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:57.073
Are they paying you
to look like a billboard?

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.412
It's Channel.
- Oh right.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:04.331
And you, Anabel? I hear you've
been begging forjobs. Embarrassing.

01:04:04.632 --> 01:04:09.627
Oh, no. No jobs.
My fiancée is too cute to work.

01:04:09.971 --> 01:04:12.384
Oops, now it's out.
- Fiancée?

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.550
Then your white-trash life
is up and running.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:19.061
Wedding. Tiny stinky house.
Five ugly white-trash kids.

01:04:19.397 --> 01:04:23.107
We'd only planned four
ugly white-trash kids but we can do five.

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:27.520
Whatever. I have to go see
the new Dolce Gabbana collection.

01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:29.363
Ciao.

01:04:33.745 --> 01:04:37.113
I have something wonderful!
- What's going on now?

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.370
I had the best-loved
family games delivered.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.705
Okay, where shall we begin?

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:46.585
I suggest Twister or Battleship,
they're not too hard.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:50.050
Let's not kid ourselves,
we're no Einsteins.

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:51.673
Albrecht!

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:56.220
I'm due an important business call.
- You'll play Twister or I'll cut you off.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.104
It's about the Sylt stud-farm.

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:04.515
I'm meant to inherit that, aren't I?

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:07.185
Don't you dare answer it, Albrecht.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.359
Hello? Yes, that's right.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.442
What? Have you lost your mind?

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:20.452
I'm not your fool.

01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:22.704
I've been patient too long!

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:24.956
We're a family, but all you do

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:27.458
is sit eating truffles and caviar.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:30.090
I had more fun in rehab!

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.588
Calm down!

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:33.552
I'm allowed a nice time

01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:37.632
after 25 fucking years
living on the bread-line

01:05:37.892 --> 01:05:41.135
without my own bedroom
and furs and all that.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.436
A good mom would let me enjoy it.

01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:45.397
She did get

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.391
the family charity on the tennis mag.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:52.355
Family? Don't make me laugh!
I've gone from one crazy to the next.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:55.191
I'm definitely not crazy!

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:58.027
Just ask any of my therapists!

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.113
Kiss my ass, I'm moving to Sylt

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.533
to sit in the Sansibar.
And I mean, on my own!

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.709
Yes, just go! Just go!

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:10.590
Sylt isn't even as nice as they say!
- Calm down now Trixi!

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:13.129
Mother! You should call me Mother!

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.461
Fuck you, Albrecht!

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.351
Stop here, Schneider.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:36.028
Would you like to get out,
Mrs von Schlacht?

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:41.411
Hello!

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:44.289
The downstairs door was open. By chance,

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:48.210
I had business nearby
and I thought I'd just pop in.

01:06:58.306 --> 01:06:59.592
Here I am.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.809
Beatrix von Schlacht.
- Hello.

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.515
I'm Carmen. I'm the other mother.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:12.108
Please, do sit down.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.729
May I offer you a first-class homemade

01:07:15.114 --> 01:07:16.275
cheese toastie?

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.816
Thanks, but I wear a size 2 to 4

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.029
you don't really think I eat bread?
- Ahem, size 6 to 8.

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:26.165
If you don't eat we won't talk to you.
- Okay.

01:07:27.252 --> 01:07:29.084
Then I'll take it.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.958
Oh, my God, is there butter on this?

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:40.884
I completely forgot how good it is.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.390
This is how low-class people eat.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.310
She's moaning at me.
She always does that.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:49.180
Moan-Abel!

01:07:49.482 --> 01:07:52.350
That's pride. She gets it from me.
- No, I don't think so.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:57.025
That can't be inherited.
It has more to do with how I raised her.

01:07:57.365 --> 01:08:00.153
And as far as I know, science

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:02.276
would back me up.

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:05.995
I don't believe in science.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.031
I believe in feelings

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:11.995
and love
and the warmth of a healthy family.

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:16.461
You're so mean! You stole my money
for your dumb cigarettes again.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.216
Rosa-child, that was a test to see

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:21.424
how much you value capital.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:25.091
I love you!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:08:26.019 --> 01:08:29.353
Little mouse.
Her lobes haven't fused yet.

01:08:31.232 --> 01:08:33.098
Well, the reason I'm here is

01:08:33.401 --> 01:08:35.484
to make you and Anabel a lucrative offer.

01:08:35.653 --> 01:08:37.645
I thought you were in the area?

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.813
Let's not kid ourselves.

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:42.157
This situation can't last.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:43.867
You're already on the breadline.

01:08:45.203 --> 01:08:46.615
But maybe

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:51.913
I can make saying goodbye
a little bit easier?

01:08:55.048 --> 01:08:57.461
You want to buy my daughter from me?

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.209
You think you can buy people?

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:05.131
Buy? Buy is nonsense, this here is just

01:09:05.515 --> 01:09:07.849
a little gift.
- Thanks, but no thanks.

01:09:09.228 --> 01:09:12.015
I have a job now. I'm earning.
- You?

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:14.439
Anabel has a very responsible

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:16.899
position with a magnate.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.566
She basically keeps
everything running clean.

01:09:23.408 --> 01:09:25.401
If you don't mind, I have to be up early.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:28.995
Of course.

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:36.045
I'm glad to have met you, madam.

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.212
Bye.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.216
Er...

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:54.726
I don't get how
you can look forward to math.

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.733
Oh, no.
- What's up?

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:02.396
Don't talk to them, okay?
- Hey, nerd. Where's the homework?

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:07.110
I told you I'm not doing it any more.
It's unfair if I do your homework.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:10.158
Pardon? I don't understand
when you talk nerd.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.625
Okay mini-gangster,
if you talk to my sister again

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:17.044
I'll shove your fake Louboutins

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:20.418
so deep up your ass
they'll come out earrings, got it?

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:23.751
I want to hear an apology. Go!

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:27.296
Sorry.
- I didn't hear you all.

01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:28.964
Sorry.
- Sorry.

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:30.633
Thank you.

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.767
Did you sew this Chanel logo on?

01:10:33.354 --> 01:10:34.845
It's the wrong way around.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:37.897
Come on, sis.

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:40.188
Thanks.
- Sure thing.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.899
You said "sister".

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:46.277
And "ass"!
- And I meant them both!

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:49.447
Ghetto fist?
- Ghetto fist.

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:53.576
Come on.
- Aura!

01:10:55.668 --> 01:10:57.876
Hey sweetie, how are you?

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:02.130
Hi.
- Hey, Pit Bull.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.042
Yeah, it was necessary.
- Anabel.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:09.760
How's it going? You two back together?
- You know the score. Fate.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:14.343
I hope you don't mind.
- We're going to be late.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.517
See you. Coming Rosa?
- Bye, little sis!

01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:19.390
Bye.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.678
MEN OF ACTION COME FROM ACTION

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:06.338
Thanks.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:20.185
Hi.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:22.354
Hey.

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:29.524
What's all this?
- It's going to be, let's say...

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:32.197
a theme-party.
- Hm.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:35.572
Are other vampires coming or just us two?
- Vampires?

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:38.745
No.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:41.240
It'll be a little... different.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:46.833
If I'm going to be hung from the ceiling
and whipped, you should know

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:49.665
I'm totally chicken.
- You seem tense.

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:52.467
But we'll change that.
- Okay.

01:13:53.137 --> 01:13:55.129
I love Andrea Bocelli's music.

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.843
You too?
- Hm...

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.639
Is he the fat one or
the one with hair implants?

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:03.019
Both are shit.

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:07.854
Excuse me a moment.
- Sure.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.321
No, fly him back.
I don't care if he wants to sing.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.741
Shove him back on the jet.
She doesn't like him.

01:14:18.287 --> 01:14:19.573
Sorry.

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:23.032
Say, is there anything to eat?
I'm starving.

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:26.830
Cool, strawberries!

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:30.377
Is there any milk?
Then I can have them with milk. Thanks.

01:14:32.259 --> 01:14:34.171
Can you pass me the cream?

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:38.096
Thanks. Come on! Thank you.

01:14:38.557 --> 01:14:41.470
They were meant to be for...

01:14:41.811 --> 01:14:45.395
the champagne,
and I wanted to feed you those,

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:47.310
and the cream...

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:51.605
Never mind.
- I've not eaten a thing all day.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:53.395
No worries.

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.781
Tell me...

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:59.617
do you know what
a professional girlfriend is?

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:03.371
A hooker.
- No, not a hooker.

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:08.039
I'll put it a different way.
Men such as myself

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:11.455
haven't really got time for real love.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:16.551
Most of the time I'm on an airplane.
I have employees all over the world,

01:15:16.887 --> 01:15:20.005
and I always have to keep my feelings
under control.

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:22.048
Not that I can't fall in love.

01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:27.054
But I'm no regular boyfriend.
I don't attend birthdays,

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:30.850
I don't hold hands at the flea-market and
I don't want to wake up with anyone.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:35.320
Love means dissolving completely,
giving yourself up entirely.

01:15:36.115 --> 01:15:39.358
Helplessness
is the most beautiful thing imaginable.

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:43.863
And I thought it was world peace.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:49.794
Has cracking jokes and acting the rebel
made you happy up until now?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:58.590
Everything would be with your consent.
We'd go slow. I'm patient.

01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:01.092
We'd only meet when you want to.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:04.884
You'd get an apartment, 20,000 euros
allowance and any car you want.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.098
I can't do it.
- Look at what you're refusing first.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.269
Try it.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:15.644
Like a good businessman.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:26.989
So, one poussin with algae-spaetzle
and 100-year-old egg.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.366
Can I get a younger egg?

01:16:30.503 --> 01:16:31.710
You do use

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:34.538
knives and forks in your ghetto?

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.458
No, we bludgeon our dogs
then rip them to shreds

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.594
with our bare hands.
That's why so I'm thrilled

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:43.005
to be here, it's a fairy tale.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:48.977
I told you this was
Swabian-Japanese fusion.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.225
Let yourself be educated.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:53.807
The sweetbread California-roll,

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:56.101
with fresh-squeezed blood foam.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:00.109
Enjoy!
You do know what calf sweetbread is?

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:02.566
Yes, of course, it's...

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:05.660
cream. Really tasty.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:08.576
No, it's what you don't have right now.

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.624
A cool boyfriend?

01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:13.956
Brains.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.174
What do you mean, brains?
That's disgusting!

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:22.594
Stop making a scene. Do you know
how hard it is to get a table here?

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:25.259
I'm sorry, Mäusi. I can eat the rest.

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:27.556
No worries.
- Aura, seriously?

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:32.062
This is what you love about being rich?
Eating moldy eggs for 54 euros,

01:17:32.398 --> 01:17:34.230
and being told off by Miss Botox?

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:37.893
Congratulations.
- I'm not Botoxed, you policeman.

01:17:38.279 --> 01:17:42.239
Are you acting the rebel, like Anabel?
That used to be embarrassing.

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:46.444
Probably because she's the only one
of you with her own personality.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.696
Hello cutie.

01:17:49.874 --> 01:17:51.991
Care to join me for a Bellini?

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.000
Beat it Ingo, it's a bad time.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.749
Ingo, it's a really good time.
Sit down. -Yann!

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.751
Please, sit down.

01:17:59.008 --> 01:18:02.718
Have fun, enjoy your fusion shit.
You're the only ones who do.

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:07.218
Yann, if you leave now it's over.
Once and for all!

01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:12.343
Fuck, that hurts.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:22.361
No, no, no, no, no!

01:18:22.656 --> 01:18:25.148
You've got it wrong. I'm the one.

01:18:25.451 --> 01:18:28.364
I want you to dominate me.
I'm always being strong.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.164
What are you wearing?

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:35.792
Pet me like a dog!

01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:38.582
Okay...

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.720
I don't know...

01:18:48.098 --> 01:18:50.511
feels like a warm ping-pong paddle.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:52.760
It feels so good.

01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:01.109
Oh, you're so strong Anabel.
- Aha.

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:04.146
I want to be humiliated by you Anabel.
Pee on me.

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:08.111
What?

01:19:08.327 --> 01:19:10.990
You want me to go on you? Pee, or...
- I know,

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:12.987
it sounds weird at first.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.457
May I ask what you drank today?

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.498
Oh! L. A. Times zones and all that.
May I take this?

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:26.339
Mistress?
- Do you mean me?

01:19:27.221 --> 01:19:28.757
Yeah, go for it.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:31.386
Thank you. Mistress.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.510
Mistress?
- Los Angeles!

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:45.319
Benny, I don't know...

01:19:45.489 --> 01:19:47.230
if I really like this.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.611
I have no time to talk now.

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:54.830
It's chaos at work. I'll jet to L. A.,
be back in two days and then we'll talk.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.241
Ciao!

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:09.302
No, no, no. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello...

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:14.136
Seriously?

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.480
Come on...

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:27.646
You awake?

01:20:36.749 --> 01:20:38.035
Yann!

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:39.456
Upstairs!

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:43.328
Yann!

01:20:48.552 --> 01:20:49.838
Oh, God!

01:20:50.095 --> 01:20:52.678
I have to take a photo.
- No. Very funny.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:56.221
Come on, I broke in semi-illegally
to save your life.

01:20:56.393 --> 01:20:59.977
I have to have some fun.
- Get these fucking things off now!

01:21:00.105 --> 01:21:01.266
In a sec.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:02.768
Forget it!

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:10.690
Why is there a plastic sheet?
- No, no! We didn't do anything.

01:21:10.908 --> 01:21:14.242
Okay, so I stroked his back, but
it was harmless. Like with a bunny.

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:17.783
You look so hot, is that a...

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:19.538
butt plug?

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:22.826
Shall I put a filter on this
before I post it?

01:21:23.170 --> 01:21:25.127
You're an asshole. If you post that...

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:30.632
What I want to know is...

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:32.878
Does this really make you horny

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:35.676
or have you fallen for his money?

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:39.264
Oh, right, like your girlfriend is poor.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:43.225
I bet that's a bonus, with your
beat-cop Mickey Mouse wages.

01:21:43.607 --> 01:21:47.146
Get her a plastic engagement ring.
- I'm not with...

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.233
Trixi?

01:21:55.327 --> 01:21:56.363
Sorry!

01:22:05.712 --> 01:22:09.422
We thought he just had a cold
but it's pneumonia.

01:22:17.975 --> 01:22:19.261
Bolko?

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.428
I did have an affair
with the tennis coach.

01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:25.771
It wasn't just a rumor.

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:30.277
That's why my forehand never improved
despite all those lessons.

01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:32.319
I'm so sorry.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.819
Seriously?
The last thing he'll ever hear is

01:22:35.993 --> 01:22:37.905
you banged the tennis coach?

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:42.997
I can't think of anything nicer.
I'm under a lot of pressure here.

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:46.417
Don't be mad, she's emotionally crippled.

01:22:51.675 --> 01:22:54.133
Daddy, what we really want to say is

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.299
we love you.

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:01.383
And we'll always remember

01:23:02.561 --> 01:23:03.972
how great

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:06.767
and funny you are.

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:12.728
How you always sneaked chocolate
under our pillows in secret.

01:23:14.615 --> 01:23:17.779
How you turned your coat
into a tipi for me.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:21.736
And...

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:27.664
how you always said not to be scared,
you'd protect us from the monsters.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:31.333
You're the best thing
that ever happened to us.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:35.004
With you, I always knew where I belonged.

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.428
Fluxi.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.016
Fluxi...

01:23:45.646 --> 01:23:47.433
What?
- Weenie?

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.059
Fluxi?

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:50.269
He said Fluxi.

01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:52.058
Fluxi.

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:56.063
Our childhood sled!
- Yes.

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:02.448
He's said goodbye.

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:10.705
He loved you both very much.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:13.045
And I do, too.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:17.209
In my own emotionally-poor way.

01:24:22.516 --> 01:24:27.728
I don't know why,
but somehow I'm really sad now, too.

01:24:29.231 --> 01:24:33.350
And I'm sorry
if I was an asshole to you guys.

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:37.149
Get over here, we're all one family now.

01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:48.035
That's not my back any more, Albrecht!
- Sorry.

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.599
I don't want you to go.

01:25:11.982 --> 01:25:14.190
Can't I keep a sister for once?

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:21.318
You know I'd rather stay here.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.026
You'll understand one day.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:35.412
This is for school.
Look after it, I loved it.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.084
Thank you.

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:42.301
I have something for you, too.
- For me?

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:46.639
It's your first milk-tooth,
it fell out when you were riding.

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:48.429
You kept this?

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:50.889
The euro is belated, of course,

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:53.471
from the tooth-fairy.

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:56.478
I should have done it back then,
you'd have loved it.

01:25:57.444 --> 01:25:59.731
This is the best gift in the world Mommy.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:06.406
I love this new way of being
with all of these new emotions.

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:16.040
Anabel,

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.541
don't go.

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.047
He's not right for you. Stay here.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:22.675
I'm going. This is best for us all.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.253
This is for you, you'll need it.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:28.093
What is it?
- Please don't open it until I'm gone.

01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:01.456
We have to stay strong, Trixi.
- Yes.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:09.715
A check for 20,000 euros.
Did he pay for her?

01:27:10.142 --> 01:27:12.475
Did she do that for us?
- It's Yann! Finally!

01:27:12.769 --> 01:27:13.805
Cool, the cops.

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:22.901
Ready for departure.

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:41.587
Couldn't you have asked her sooner?
- Andi, I can't chat about love right now.

01:28:22.214 --> 01:28:25.457
That's typical, eh?
They're always too late.

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:29.211
Fuck!
- But the first to write a ticket.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.307
Okay, I'm going for a walk.

01:28:47.197 --> 01:28:49.154
You'll love the house in L. A.

01:28:49.658 --> 01:28:51.490
Why aren't they getting up?

01:28:52.202 --> 01:28:55.366
We're coming too. Are you in the house
in Malibu or the Hills?

01:28:55.705 --> 01:28:58.118
The pool in the Hills is super-cool.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.867
Say... are they hookers?

01:29:02.003 --> 01:29:03.539
Probably.
- Yeah.

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:06.752
I'm a travel agent,
I'm only a hooker on the side.

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:13.008
I'm out. I thought I could be bought
but I won't do you on a plastic sheet.

01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:16.140
I have my pride!
- Anabel, relax.

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:18.972
Relax? I want to go back home now,

01:29:19.437 --> 01:29:21.895
to my family.
- Anabel have some Champagne

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:25.479
and calm down.
- I can't calm down I have bipolar-uterus!

01:29:30.824 --> 01:29:33.111
Do you see that, or is it my pills?

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:36.615
I was wondering the same thing.
- She's coming back!

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:52.668
No, that way, that way!

01:29:53.471 --> 01:29:54.882
Okay!

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:57.465
What's that?

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:09.151
Wow! Do you want a job?

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:35.302
You know that's my car, right?
- It handles really well.

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:37.759
Though it's an ugly color.

01:30:39.309 --> 01:30:41.722
But it suits you somehow.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.104
I thought I'd stay after all.
- Yeah?

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:50.609
Can that guy whip you at home?
- No, I've chosen a career instead.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:53.855
I have a 20,000 euro debt, but hey,

01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:57.070
I'll just have to pay it off.
Get a cleaning job.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.069
At ten euros an hour,
it'll only take 35,000 years.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:03.823
But I really want to build something up.
- The modern woman.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:07.001
Who knows? Maybe I'll join the police.

01:31:07.796 --> 01:31:10.004
It looks like they'll take anyone.

01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:17.253
Do you think you can really balance
all three: cleaning, career and love?

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:21.591
Yeah, it'll be hard, but...

01:31:22.519 --> 01:31:25.478
I think we can manage. I mean...

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:27.729
you're an idiot. I'm an idiot.

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:29.440
It fits.

01:31:30.986 --> 01:31:32.693
And I love plastic rings.

01:31:35.991 --> 01:31:37.607
You only ever...

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:40.363
talk... nonsense.

01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:03.598
You erased the photos, right?

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:06.476
Why should I?

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.472
I'm not kidding, you can erase them.

01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:12.650
What's it worth?
Those photos mean a lot to me.

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:14.981
You're so cute holding a butt-plug.

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:18.189
I can't stand you, you know that?
- Is that right?

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:21.483
Can I drive again now?

01:32:21.661 --> 01:32:24.278
No way.
- Just for a little while.

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:26.072
Forget it!
- Aw!

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:29.537
But we're putting the siren on at least.
- Nope.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:41.595
<i>Thank God! Another happy ending.</i>

01:32:41.723 --> 01:32:45.057
<i>I was worried she was going to fly away
with that idiot.</i>

01:32:45.351 --> 01:32:50.563
<i>Well, although our nurses from
the start of the story really messed up,</i>

01:32:50.774 --> 01:32:55.018
<i>two totally crazy moms
are better than one anyway.</i>

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:59.693
<i>How does that esoteric
yoga-chick saying go? Oh, yes:</i>

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:02.571
<i>The journey is the destination.</i>
