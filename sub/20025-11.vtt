WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.574 --> 00:12.078
Six years ago, the Geordie squad
first got together.

00:15.615 --> 00:19.486
But it's not all been one big party.
Back to work.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.255
We've had to work
for that wrinkly fuck, Anna.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.559
But we fucking nailed it.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.628
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:30.663 --> 00:34.033
We've only gone and made
her business a global success.

00:35.235 --> 00:38.438
So, now, the squad is expanding.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.940
Oi, oi.
Hello!

00:41.007 --> 00:43.910
Hiya!
(all cheer)

00:49.249 --> 00:52.385
I'm not gonna be able
to keep yous all on full-time.

00:52.452 --> 00:57.824
We need to help Anna decide
who stays... and who goes.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.026
(cheering)

01:00.093 --> 01:02.362
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:02.429 --> 01:05.131
Are they fucking radge enough?

01:05.197 --> 01:07.934
To join this crazy family?

01:13.973 --> 01:15.642
Let wuh fucking gan.

01:17.343 --> 01:20.880
I'm so pleased me and Aaron are
getting on. I've waited so long.

01:20.947 --> 01:23.216
I think Zahida needs to
get me in a taxi.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.185
(laughs)
I know this is wrong,

01:25.251 --> 01:26.619
but I can't help it.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.456
Why did yous leave together?
Haven't done fuck all.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.057
I feel so betrayed.

01:31.124 --> 01:33.893
Hi, darling!
Someone's getting the boot.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.829
Sam won't be needed.

01:35.895 --> 01:37.597
What a bitch.

01:40.166 --> 01:43.102
I never wanna fuck this up.
Cos I love her so much.

01:43.169 --> 01:46.172
I need to tell someone what happened
with me and Zahida.

01:48.174 --> 01:51.010
It is the worst,
having secrets in this house.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.547
All I want to do right now is run.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.783
Scott and Zahida
did actually neck on.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.519
Zahida knows how much I like him.

01:59.586 --> 02:02.489
She's done the worst thing
she can possibly do,

02:02.555 --> 02:04.591
go behind me back and betrayed us.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.428
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.864
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.600
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.935
Get me in,
cos I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:16.002 --> 02:18.037
I'm preened to perfection.

02:18.104 --> 02:20.573
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.443
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:23.510 --> 02:26.346
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:26.412 --> 02:29.816
Me quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.452
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:42.996 --> 02:45.798
Last night, I couldn't face
coming back to the house.

02:45.865 --> 02:48.701
When Gary confronted us
in the club, I freaked out.

02:48.768 --> 02:52.472
And now I'm petrified everyone's
gonna know that I kissed Scott.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.387
I can't get over what happened.

03:07.453 --> 03:10.957
I feel so bad cos I thought Zahida
didn't do it. I stuck up for her.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.561
What's worse is all of the
compulsive lying to our faces.

03:14.627 --> 03:18.164
Whatever you do in this house
always comes out in the end.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.934
And last night,
we found out Zahida's secret.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.403
She has been kissing Scott.

03:23.469 --> 03:27.907
And she's got a boyfriend. I don't
think anything this bad has happened.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.443
I don't know how Zahida
will get through this.

03:30.510 --> 03:34.647
She's kissed Scott with a boyfriend
and with her best friend liking him.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.051
Zahida's totally broken
all aspects of girl code.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.320
If she wants to be
part of this family,

03:40.386 --> 03:42.722
she's gotta realise
she's gotta be loyal,

03:42.789 --> 03:44.791
cos we all have
each other's backs.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.628
Kebab.
Oh, my God! Smell it.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.030
Look how weird that chicken nugget...
Ooh.

03:52.932 --> 03:55.568
Fucking hell, man.
What's going on in this ken?

03:55.635 --> 03:59.105
I cannot believe Gaz outed me
and Zahida. The fucking tit.

03:59.172 --> 04:02.342
Maybe I did go too far,
trying to get with all the newbies,

04:02.408 --> 04:04.844
but you cannot really
blame a kid for trying.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.247
So, what are you gonna do?
I just wanna see how things pan out.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.718
Er, badly.
(they laugh)

04:17.322 --> 04:21.361
I'm still in shock that Scott
and Zahida actually necked on.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.364
Zahida knows that
both me and Sarah like him.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.566
And she's been lying about it
for days.

04:26.633 --> 04:29.202
I literally don't even know
what to say, Abbie.

04:29.268 --> 04:31.738
It's your best friend as well.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.041
Fuck me, if, like,
me best friend can do that

04:35.108 --> 04:37.210
and go there with someone
that I like.

04:37.276 --> 04:40.413
If one good thing's
come out of this shit situation,

04:40.480 --> 04:43.850
it's that me and Abbie
have united together

04:43.916 --> 04:47.487
over our shared anger
about Zahida and Scott.

04:47.553 --> 04:49.622
He's the reason for it all.

04:49.689 --> 04:53.693
And I think... I think we need to
realise, as well, that it's him.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.295
I know Scott's been acting
like a proper dick,

04:56.362 --> 04:59.932
but I still have feelings for him.
I'm not gonna tell Sarah that.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.343
Glad someone's got a smile
on their face, the prick.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.346
He doesn't give two fucks
about anyone but himself.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.814
No.
Actually radge.

05:17.684 --> 05:21.287
It smells of loneliness.
(laughs) Funny.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.857
Knowing the girls in this house,
now they know about me and Zahida,

05:24.924 --> 05:27.560
she's not in a good place.
I'll make sure she's OK.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.761
How are you feeling?

05:29.629 --> 05:30.630
Mm.

05:31.531 --> 05:35.535
Fuck! I can't believe Gary's told
everyone. It should've come from me.

05:35.601 --> 05:39.105
But now that he's said it,
it's gonna make me look worse.

05:39.172 --> 05:44.177
I feel bad that I kissed you, cos
obviously I have a boyfriend and...

05:44.243 --> 05:47.146
I shouldn't be doing that.
And I also feel bad

05:47.213 --> 05:50.083
because I'm friends
with Sarah and Abbie.

05:50.149 --> 05:54.187
I need to apologise to Abbie, and I
need to say sorry to Sarah as well.

05:54.253 --> 05:58.224
I've got a bad feeling none of the
girls are going to talk to us today.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.761
Basically, what happened, happened
at the end of the day.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.297
And we can't really,
like, deny it happened.

06:04.363 --> 06:08.067
Me and Zahida are both to blame.
Cos it does take two to tango.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.204
The only problem is,
this divvy needs to stop dancing.

06:11.270 --> 06:14.907
I feel like I've lost me best mate
over a boy. That's never happened.

06:14.974 --> 06:16.609
You've never been around me.

06:25.651 --> 06:29.188
Sarah and Abbie definitely need
cheering up after everything.

06:29.255 --> 06:31.824
Me and the girls are gonna
take them for a blow dry.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.128
Oh! Hello.

06:35.194 --> 06:36.829
There she is.

06:37.730 --> 06:42.301
We're all waiting to leave for our
curly blows, and Zahida slithers in

06:42.368 --> 06:45.705
like the reptile that she is.
I wonder when this little snake

06:45.772 --> 06:47.006
is gonna apologise.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.207
Howay.

06:49.976 --> 06:54.947
No, just silence. It's amazing how
easily a friendship can fall apart.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.652
You should be ashamed of yourself,
Come on, girls.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.855
It's clear, none of the lasses
have got time for Zahida.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.559
While they get their hair done,
we'll take her for a boozy brunch.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.701
Ooh!

07:15.768 --> 07:19.839
The girls have invited me and Sarah
for a blow dry. Just what I need.

07:19.906 --> 07:23.309
The fabulous five...
stunners in Newcastle.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.744
(all) Cheers.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.817
Me and the boys have arrived
at the pub,

07:30.883 --> 07:33.252
and it's a bit awkward
with Zahida here.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.888
So I'm taking Martin and Scott
with me to the bar.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.659
Feels like I'm going to get
an interrogation.

07:39.725 --> 07:43.963
I am pissed off with Zahida,
cos she lied straight to my face.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.299
But shouting at her
is gonna get nowhere.

07:46.365 --> 07:50.069
So I'm gonna try and give her
some advice. Hopefully she listens.

07:50.136 --> 07:53.005
You have to fucking own it
and go back to the house like,

07:53.072 --> 07:57.009
"Can I have a word? I fucked up
and I'm so fucking sorry."

07:57.076 --> 08:00.546
What Gary's saying is right.
I do need to own it.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.449
Kissing Scott
was a stupid thing to do.

08:03.516 --> 08:07.787
And now I've upset two of me
closest friends. This is shit.

08:07.854 --> 08:11.724
I literally don't know what
got into us. I just got so drunk.

08:11.791 --> 08:15.328
In here, you're gonna have to be
strong over the next 24 hours.

08:15.394 --> 08:18.931
Sarah and Abbie, all the girls
eventually will come around.

08:18.998 --> 08:19.999
It'll be fine.

08:20.066 --> 08:23.569
I'm not surprised Zahida's crying.
But in this fucked-up family,

08:23.636 --> 08:26.839
we all make mistakes. And when
we do, we forgive and forget.

08:26.906 --> 08:30.743
I think the best thing to is get
pissed, get a taxi back with Scott.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.044
(they laugh)

08:38.317 --> 08:40.586
Sarah, I can't imagine
how you feel.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.823
Scary thing is, she's carried on
like it hasn't happened.

08:43.890 --> 08:48.861
One thing we don't really tolerate
is fucking your mates over.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.596
You know? You can't do that.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.531
I know Anna wants the best workers.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.901
All we care about
is who's best to live with.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.937
Zahida went behind her
best friend's back and lied.

08:58.004 --> 09:01.407
I really appreciate yous being
there for us and having me back.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.443
It's what's right and what's wrong.
She's wrong, so...

09:04.510 --> 09:06.345
We'll always stick up for you.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.686
Me hair's done,
and I feel a new woman.

09:13.753 --> 09:16.789
Hopefully Scott will realise
what he's missing

09:16.856 --> 09:20.927
We'll have a good night.
All dolled up. Let's go get ready.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.700
# We're gonna get you rocking
And we're gonna get you jumpin' #

09:27.767 --> 09:32.872
We get back, and thank fuck,
none of the girls are back yet.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.479
Hello.
We get back,

09:40.546 --> 09:44.984
and Zahida is sat on the sofa.
This is so awkward.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.086
Hands up if you can
slice the tension.

09:47.153 --> 09:51.223
Marty, you will need an axe to cut
the tension in this fucking room.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.125
(phone rings)
Oh! Aah! Ha!

09:53.192 --> 09:54.293
Shit. I shit myself.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.297
Oh, howay, Anna, man.
Take a fucking day off, will you?

09:58.364 --> 10:00.099
Hello?

10:00.166 --> 10:03.502
"Hi, Nathan. How are you?"
I'm fine. How are you?

10:03.569 --> 10:04.837
(burps)

10:04.904 --> 10:08.374
"Tonight, you, Chloe, Marty
and the new girls have got work."

10:08.441 --> 10:10.343
Get in!
"Now, listen."

10:10.409 --> 10:13.946
"You know I'm looking for the best
workers in Newcastle." I know.

10:14.013 --> 10:16.282
"And I've got some big news."

10:16.349 --> 10:19.585
What the fuck is Anna banging
on the phone to Nathan about?

10:19.652 --> 10:21.420
He looks proper serious.

10:21.487 --> 10:25.124
"Only one of the girls will be chosen
to join the team full time."

10:25.191 --> 10:27.460
Holy fuck. After all this,

10:27.526 --> 10:31.130
Anna only wants one person
to stay in the house full time.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.165
What's the daft bitch playing at?

10:33.232 --> 10:34.967
Bye.
Spill the juice!

10:35.034 --> 10:37.570
Saggy tits, you. Right, so...

10:37.636 --> 10:39.772
tonight at work, it's me,
Chloe, Marty,

10:39.839 --> 10:41.507
and the new girls.
(cheering)

10:41.574 --> 10:45.811
I am buzzing that I get to go to
work with my best friend Marty,

10:45.878 --> 10:50.149
cos me and him are getting on
better than ever. Woo-hoo!

10:50.216 --> 10:52.418
Why are you a jobsworth?
Cos I am. Girls?

10:52.485 --> 10:54.854
Can yous go to your room?
I know it's awkward.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.823
I need to talk to the originals.
Yeah.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.692
Boys, can you come downstairs?!

11:01.127 --> 11:04.463
Zahida, do you want to go with
your two best mates? (laughs)

11:04.530 --> 11:09.001
Nathan sending us to our room
can only mean bad news.

11:09.068 --> 11:13.472
Plus, I haven't even spoke to
the girls yet. This is horrendous.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.843
So, Anna's just been on the phone.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.279
She's also just dropped
another bombshell.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.447
What?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.482
Shit. This must be serious.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.786
Only one person is staying.

11:26.852 --> 11:28.387
What?!

11:28.454 --> 11:32.291
Nathan tells us that only one
of the newbies is gonna be staying.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.694
I can't believe it. If I had to
pick one of the newbies to stay,

11:35.761 --> 11:38.197
it would be Sarah,
cos I get on with her best.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.800
Shut up, man.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.269
I do feel a bit sad.
At the beginning,

11:43.335 --> 11:46.739
I didn't like that all these
newbies were here. But now,

11:46.806 --> 11:49.742
I do feel like I can call them
part of me family.

11:49.809 --> 11:52.078
She didn't say when, but...

11:52.144 --> 11:55.414
Out of all the newbies,
there's only gonna be one left.

11:55.481 --> 11:59.051
The competition, now,
is gonna start getting intense.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.620
Yous two, shall we go
get ready for work?

12:01.687 --> 12:03.589
Aye!
We've got a job to do.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.930
(flatulence)
(gasps)

12:13.966 --> 12:16.368
I need to tell you something
before we go.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.370
It's not good news, guys.

12:18.437 --> 12:21.841
The newbies still don't know
what Anna said on the phone.

12:21.907 --> 12:25.578
They're thinking that two of them,
or even three might be staying.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.379
But they're not. Only one is.

12:27.446 --> 12:31.317
Only one of yous is gonna stay.
Two people will be going home.

12:31.383 --> 12:35.287
Is Nathan having us on? I love this
house. And I don't wanna leave.

12:35.354 --> 12:37.857
The competition
is really heating up.

12:37.923 --> 12:42.128
So, whatever differences yous
have got now... Put them aside.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.130
Cos it is only gonna be one,
not two.

12:44.196 --> 12:48.200
I feel like I need a miracle if
I'm the one who's gonna get chosen,

12:48.267 --> 12:50.202
cos I've pissed off a lot of people.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.238
Let's go, bitches!
Come on!

12:52.304 --> 12:54.907
I really wanna be
a part of this family.

12:54.974 --> 12:59.078
After what Nathan said, it's now
or never. The gloves are off.

13:01.847 --> 13:05.584
Go! One of the last chances for
the newbies to prove themselves.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.489
This is a fucking disaster.
He keeps telling us he loves us.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.126
I'm fucking fuming, Scott.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.828
You should care about Abbie!

13:15.895 --> 13:17.897
It's now or never.
Fuck off!

13:17.963 --> 13:19.131
Shit has hit the fan.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.967
Fucking ding-ding.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.502
Marnie! Marnie!

13:23.569 --> 13:25.804
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:29.008 --> 13:29.208
.

13:31.710 --> 13:31.911
.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.090
Hello!

13:45.157 --> 13:46.559
Hey, guys.

13:46.625 --> 13:50.629
'Tonight, Anna's sent me, Chloe
and Marty to work with the newbies.

13:50.696 --> 13:54.400
And it's gonna be awkward,
cos Sarah and Abbie hate Zahida.

13:54.466 --> 13:56.602
(cheering)

13:56.669 --> 14:00.606
I'm so excited for work tonight.
We're hosting a roller disco.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.176
It's one of the last chances for
the newbies to prove themselves.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.845
I hope we put drama to the side
and put graft first.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.315
(cheering)

14:11.050 --> 14:12.885
Bosh! Bosh!

14:12.952 --> 14:16.121
Right now, I need to focus
on nailing work.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.758
Not on the fact I haven't
made up with Abbie and Sarah.

14:19.825 --> 14:22.828
We're gonna play limbo,
but with the skates on.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.731
(cheering)

14:28.200 --> 14:31.804
I'm actually really enjoying work.
If Zahida comes near us,

14:31.870 --> 14:34.240
I can just skate away. This is mint.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.509
(screaming)

14:48.287 --> 14:52.224
Let's have a cheers to the originals.
Cheers to the fucking originals.

14:52.291 --> 14:55.127
Now, let's go out
and go fucking ballistic.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.171
Chloe, Marty and the newbies
are still at work,

15:06.238 --> 15:10.009
so hopefully we can have some nice.
relaxed drinks before they come.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.512
(all cheer)

15:16.315 --> 15:19.785
Everyone's in really good spirits,
and I hope that tonight

15:19.852 --> 15:21.553
this mood carries on.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.161
I haven't spoke to Zahida all day.

15:29.228 --> 15:31.363
Like every story,
there is two sides.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.300
So, I'm gonna pull her aside
and have a word with her.

15:34.366 --> 15:37.603
Assuming you, Sarah and Abbie
still haven't talked.

15:43.208 --> 15:44.743
Do you regret it, though?

15:47.646 --> 15:50.449
Zahida is clearly upset about
all that's happened.

15:50.516 --> 15:53.285
Maybe the girl does deserve a break.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.321
Cos it's not nice being isolated.

15:55.387 --> 15:57.890
I know I've brought this on myself.

15:58.757 --> 16:01.694
I feel like I don't have
a leg to stand on.

16:01.760 --> 16:05.364
I feel like, if I get shouted at,
I should let them.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.733
This feels fucking awful.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.802
All it was, was a drunken mistake.

16:09.868 --> 16:11.370
I need to sort things out.

16:11.437 --> 16:15.507
For now, let's not worry about it.
Let's just get back to work.

16:15.574 --> 16:17.576
Zahida has fucked up massively,

16:17.643 --> 16:20.145
but I don't think it's
gonna cloud my judgement

16:20.212 --> 16:21.780
on whether she should stay.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.149
Oh!

16:27.753 --> 16:30.956
Who's ready for the next bar?!
(all cheer)

16:31.023 --> 16:34.326
Work has been mint, but I
cannot wait to get to the club,

16:34.393 --> 16:36.695
see the others and get mortal.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.135
(cheering)

16:43.202 --> 16:47.573
All the workers have just arrived.
Time to get this party started.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.318
There's not that many
talking to Zahida.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.687
But I don't have
an ounce of sympathy.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.256
She got herself into this,
she can deal with it.

17:06.892 --> 17:10.329
Howay then, you jobsworths.
What's been going on at work?

17:18.170 --> 17:21.039
Zahida needs to prove to the girls
that she is sorry.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.409
Cos everyone does deserve
a second chance.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.651
Me and Zahida still haven't spoke
since she necked on with Scott.

17:32.718 --> 17:36.388
But now I'm finally ready to talk.
And I wanna find out why the fuck

17:36.455 --> 17:37.689
she betrayed us.

17:40.025 --> 17:44.296
Oh, shit. Sarah's walking over.
It's now or never.

17:56.975 --> 17:59.745
I can see Zahida and Sarah
are talking.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.781
And I just hope to God
that Zahida is apologising,

18:02.848 --> 18:05.651
because it's affecting
everybody else in the house.

18:11.957 --> 18:17.095
I cannot stand to listen to
any more of Zahida's excuses.

18:17.162 --> 18:19.531
I've gotta take myself
away from this.

18:27.439 --> 18:31.243
Great. Sarah's stormed off.
But there's nothing more I can do.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.679
This night is a fucking disaster.

18:36.515 --> 18:39.251
What going on?
The others have just got here,

18:39.318 --> 18:43.355
And Zahida has already upset Sarah.
Hasn't she caused enough trouble?

18:51.763 --> 18:55.501
Before I get completely off me dish,
I'm gonna go and speak to Abbie.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.202
She deserves an explanation.

19:01.106 --> 19:05.611
Angry? I'm fucking fuming, Scott.
You've made me out to be such a mug.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.258
I'm putting every bit of charm
on Abbie to win her back over.

19:19.324 --> 19:23.195
I've never had to work this hard
since the last time I did it.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.371
The problem is, I do like Scott.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.907
But I'm not gonna let him
get away with it easy.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.609
He's got a lot more to do
to win me back.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.620
I'm just glad
I've got Chloe in this ken.

19:48.687 --> 19:52.157
We've been through shit times,
but now we're getting on wicked.

19:59.164 --> 20:02.568
Me and Marty have been spending
a lot more time together.

20:02.634 --> 20:04.503
And he keeps telling us he loves us.

20:04.570 --> 20:08.373
Does that mean me and him are
more than friends? I kind of hope so.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.721
Even though
there's been a few arguments,

20:22.788 --> 20:25.557
tonight's been good.
Let's continue at the house.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.793
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:36.868 --> 20:40.172
Oh!
Scran! Where's the scran?

20:40.238 --> 20:42.107
(gasps)

20:43.775 --> 20:48.013
Tonight has been shit. I'm just
gonna chill out and get some food.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.881
I need some water.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.583
I'm trying to enjoy me food

20:51.650 --> 20:54.086
and Zahida's face
is massively winding us up.

20:54.152 --> 20:58.056
She's lied to us. It makes me blood
boil. I can't ignore it anymore.

20:58.123 --> 21:02.561
What I can't understand
is that you argued with me, Zahida.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.364
Yeah, I did. You nearly had
a full-on fight with me,

21:05.430 --> 21:07.065
knowing you were in the wrong.

21:07.132 --> 21:09.601
I didn't know I was in the wrong.
That's a lie.

21:09.668 --> 21:13.972
She can't remember... Why are you
sticking up for Zahida?! I'm not.

21:14.039 --> 21:17.109
I knew Marnie would
invite herself to an argument

21:17.175 --> 21:19.811
she's got nowt to do with.
Fucking typical.

21:19.878 --> 21:24.282
You should be caring about Abbie.
I do. You should care about Abbie!

21:24.349 --> 21:26.218
Not her.
He does care about Abbie.

21:26.284 --> 21:27.886
He cares about Abbie the most.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.989
Did he say that with his
fucking tongue down your mouth?

21:31.056 --> 21:33.692
There's no point in me
trying to explain myself.

21:33.759 --> 21:36.528
Cos no-one's gonna let us
get a word in edgeways.

21:36.595 --> 21:37.896
Whatever! Whatever!

21:37.963 --> 21:42.467
I don't even wanna argue. I just
don't like you. Let's go outside.

21:42.534 --> 21:45.303
I'm gonna get Zahida outside,
away from this noise.

21:45.370 --> 21:47.506
It's not gonna get sorted in here.

21:47.572 --> 21:50.776
Scott's out there,
Zahida's there, go and talk.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.879
Gary's right. I need to
speak to Scott and Zahida.

21:53.945 --> 21:58.183
I may have been sitting quietly.
Doesn't mean I've got nothing to say.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.653
Abbie, literally, like,
I understand that I fucked up

22:01.720 --> 22:05.691
and I've let you down. But I do
like you. And that's the way it is.

22:05.757 --> 22:09.261
So, I'm gonna walk way
and I'm sorry.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.897
Fuck, Scott's leaving
me and Abbie alone.

22:11.963 --> 22:15.200
But I know I need to talk to her.
I just hope this goes well.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.036
I feel fucking betrayed by you,

22:18.103 --> 22:22.908
cos me and you...
were getting very close together.

22:22.974 --> 22:26.211
If Zahida would told me
straight away what happened,

22:26.278 --> 22:29.414
I would've got over it.
But now it's a dirty secret.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.383
And that's made it so much worse.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.785
I think...
(they talk over each other)

22:33.852 --> 22:36.088
Listen.
(they talk over each other)

22:36.154 --> 22:40.292
You fucking raise your voice.
If you had a doubt... Listen!

22:44.362 --> 22:46.131
I hear everything kicking off.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.533
I need to find out
what the fuck's going on.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.569
It's kicking off.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.037
Shut your fucking mouth.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.573
(they shout over each other)

22:57.209 --> 23:00.045
Fucking idiot!
Don't fucking push me!

23:00.112 --> 23:03.148
Fucking ding-ding! It's gan off.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.751
(screaming, shouting)

23:11.189 --> 23:14.459
These radgie newbies
need to calm the fuck down.

23:14.526 --> 23:17.896
Me and Marty need to stop this
before anyone loses any gnashers.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.197
Shit has hit the fan.

23:19.264 --> 23:20.832
Go in here, man.

23:26.705 --> 23:29.040
'What the fuck?'

23:29.107 --> 23:31.777
How fucking dare she? I've seen red.

23:31.843 --> 23:33.678
(drowned out by shouting)

23:33.745 --> 23:35.080
Whoa, man!

23:35.147 --> 23:39.684
Marnie has gone mental,
chucking plant pots at the shag pad.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.354
I'm so glad
I'm on the other side of the glass.

23:43.688 --> 23:44.923
Marnie, man!

23:44.990 --> 23:48.627
Marnie has lost her shit.
We'll need double glazing tomorrow.

23:48.693 --> 23:51.797
(they shout over each other)

23:51.863 --> 23:54.866
I've seen some fights
in this house, but this one...

23:54.933 --> 23:56.334
fucking ruthless.

23:56.401 --> 23:57.669
Get off me!

23:58.637 --> 24:00.438
(they talk over each other)

24:00.505 --> 24:03.975
Tonight has been a fucking disaster.
I just wanna go to bed

24:04.042 --> 24:05.510
and forget about it all.

24:14.653 --> 24:19.391
I didn't think sending Abbie outside
would lead to a full-on fight. Oops!

24:26.064 --> 24:28.934
Abbie and Sarah
our both in our room tonight.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.136
It's best
we keep them away from Zahida,

24:31.203 --> 24:33.438
cos I want no more arguments.

24:39.444 --> 24:42.414
'Fighting with Abbie
was a shit thing to do.'

24:42.480 --> 24:44.649
'I can't believe
how bad things got.'

24:44.716 --> 24:47.452
Right now,
I'm absolutely heartbroken.

24:53.892 --> 24:55.827
Phone! Who's that? Anna.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.896
You girls need to learn your lesson.

24:57.963 --> 25:00.165
This is fucking awkward.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.567
Good for the heart, soul, eyes.
Good for...

25:02.634 --> 25:06.171
It's also good for sandwiches.
I'd rather dust Martin again.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.607
I, like, genuinely, like...
like you.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.308
Tonight is gonna be a good one.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.079
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

25:16.481 --> 25:16.681
.

25:19.184 --> 25:19.384
.

25:34.432 --> 25:36.368
(groaning)

25:36.434 --> 25:38.503
Morning, everybody.
Morning.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.506
Last night,
Marnie thought she was Kung Fu Panda

25:41.573 --> 25:43.808
by hitting in
the bloody shag pad window.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.011
And Zahida and Abbie went pure radge.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.747
Abbie, did she start it first?
Did she go for you?

25:48.813 --> 25:52.083
Yeah, she started on me first.
I feel fucking awful.

25:52.150 --> 25:56.421
I never get into fights and I
shouldn't have lashed out on Zahida.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.056
I feel terrible.

25:58.123 --> 26:02.160
Anna's gonna lose her fucking shit.
Anna's gonna be fucking fuming.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.729
I shouldn't have
went in on Zahida like that.

26:04.796 --> 26:08.700
And I shouldn't have put my foot
through the window. That was stupid.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.869
I'm starving.
I need to get some scran.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.504
Me too. I'll go with you.

26:15.807 --> 26:19.744
After all that shit last night
with Zahida and fucking Marnie,

26:19.811 --> 26:22.180
I think Sarah and Abbie
need to fuck off.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.849
Sarah and Abbie
need to get the fuck out.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.119
And with Marnie raging around
like a pregnant Staffie,

26:28.186 --> 26:30.255
I actually feel bad for Zahida.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.161
(laughs)

26:36.227 --> 26:38.263
You're gonna take her out?
(laughs)

26:38.330 --> 26:42.534
A lot's went on between me and
Abbie. I feel like a cheeky date.

26:46.972 --> 26:48.540
Did I just hear that right?

26:48.606 --> 26:50.508
Scott is gonna take Abbie out?!

26:50.575 --> 26:53.645
His idea of romance
is a kebab and a blowie.

26:53.712 --> 26:54.746
Good luck, Abbie.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.983
Right, scran.
Cappuccino, please.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.151
I'll have a mocha.
(laughs)

27:05.156 --> 27:07.726
It's pink. I want it to grow out.

27:07.792 --> 27:11.229
All right?
Yeah, I just feel a bit shit still.

27:11.296 --> 27:14.566
You'll be all right, Last night,
like I say, worst is done.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.201
(phone rings)

27:16.267 --> 27:17.936
Phone! Who's that? Anna.

27:18.003 --> 27:19.404
Oh, God!

27:19.471 --> 27:22.140
For fuck's sake.
Here comes the Anna bell again.

27:22.207 --> 27:23.808
I'm gonna have to suck it up.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.977
Hello?
"Hi, Marnie."

27:26.044 --> 27:28.079
Hi.
"Now, listen."

27:28.146 --> 27:31.783
"I won't tolerate aggressive
behaviour. It's not on at all."

27:31.850 --> 27:34.652
I know. I need to stop
getting so angry, don't I?

27:34.719 --> 27:39.024
"I'm not happy with Zahida either,
so you two have got a punishment."

27:39.090 --> 27:40.525
All right. Where at?

27:40.592 --> 27:42.460
"I'm sending you to clean a club."

27:42.527 --> 27:44.662
"You girls
need to learn your lesson."

27:44.729 --> 27:45.930
OK.

27:45.997 --> 27:47.098
Bye, Anna.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.902
Marnie looks worried. I hope
I haven't fucked everything up

27:50.969 --> 27:52.537
by getting into a fight.

27:52.604 --> 27:55.607
So, me and Zahida
have got to go and clean somewhere.

27:55.673 --> 27:58.777
Oh, shit! I would love to be
a fly on the wall in that place.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.846
(Aaron) The good thing about
them going to clean the club

28:01.913 --> 28:04.382
is there's no-one else
to stick their nose in.

28:04.449 --> 28:08.153
So they're gonna have to sort it out
before they get back to the house.

28:22.333 --> 28:26.304
We get to the club
and this is fucking awkward.

28:32.310 --> 28:34.846
Even though Zahida's
massively in the wrong,

28:34.913 --> 28:37.582
I do feed bad
for kicking off that badly.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.385
I need to apologise
for getting so aggressive,

28:40.452 --> 28:42.921
but it's not how I wanna act.
I am sorry for that.

28:42.987 --> 28:46.124
I'm really sorry too
for, like, betraying your trust.

28:46.191 --> 28:49.094
And not only that,
but for looking like I lied.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.597
I thought Zahida was out of order,
and I was fuming with her,

28:52.664 --> 28:56.167
but we all make mistakes and
there's no point holding a grudge.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.969
Everyone thinks you're a liar,

28:58.036 --> 29:02.507
so I think all you can do now
is just prove everyone wrong.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.176
Me and Marnie have made progress.

29:05.243 --> 29:09.214
We can now sit in the same room
without wanting to kill each other.

29:09.280 --> 29:12.917
Fucking spotless. I know. She's not
getting any more out of me.

29:16.454 --> 29:19.624
Marty, I'm glad you're growing
that chest hair! (laughs)

29:19.691 --> 29:23.061
Dinner, everybody!
Give us a munch on that cucumber.

29:23.128 --> 29:27.332
Marnie and Zahida's out, so the rest
of us are gonna have a pamper day,

29:27.398 --> 29:28.900
and what better way to do it

29:28.967 --> 29:32.504
than some chocolate fruit
slobbed all over your face?

29:32.570 --> 29:36.141
This is good for the heart,
the soul, the eyes, the face.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.743
Good for sandwiches.
Move your arm, please.

29:39.744 --> 29:42.747
(Scott) While them dafties
are sucking each other off,

29:42.814 --> 29:45.517
I'm gonna find Abbie
and get back in the good books.

29:45.583 --> 29:46.818
Fucking nae bother!

29:46.885 --> 29:49.521
Fancy getting an ice cream
so I can talk to you,

29:49.587 --> 29:52.757
because trying to speak
in this house is a nightmare.

29:52.824 --> 29:54.058
Yeah, it's nice.

29:54.125 --> 29:57.262
A lot of people have been
getting in my ear about Scott,

29:57.328 --> 30:00.265
so I'm glad to get out
and hear what he's got to say.

30:03.168 --> 30:05.136
I've decided to be a pure gentleman

30:05.203 --> 30:07.839
and take Abbie out for dessert
to soften her up.

30:07.906 --> 30:10.208
Ah, thank you very much. Cheers.

30:10.275 --> 30:13.344
Scott needs know I'm not
one of those girls he can mug off.

30:13.411 --> 30:16.548
So if he wants to get back
in my good books, he needs to graft.

30:16.614 --> 30:19.117
I, like, genuinely, like...
like you.

30:19.184 --> 30:21.286
That's why I wanted to take you
away.

30:22.187 --> 30:24.322
Obviously I'm sorry for what I did,

30:24.389 --> 30:28.927
but... like... it is obvious that
I'm interested in you, not them.

30:28.993 --> 30:32.363
'I know Scott's a dickhead
and I shouldn't like him.'

30:32.430 --> 30:35.633
But I do, and I just can't
stay mad at him for long.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.269
I do... I do forgive you.

30:38.336 --> 30:39.604
But...

30:39.671 --> 30:41.239
you can't do it again, Scott.

30:41.306 --> 30:44.242
I knew it'd be easy
getting back in Abbie's good books,

30:44.309 --> 30:47.145
but let's not waste time.
Haway, pet, give us a kiss.

30:48.813 --> 30:52.083
I'm so glad Scott made the effort
and took us out.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.319
But let's get back
and get ready,

30:54.385 --> 30:57.422
cos I've got a feeling
tonight is gonna be a good one.

30:57.488 --> 30:58.823
Scott!

31:09.567 --> 31:12.537
After cleaning up all day,
working my arse off,

31:12.604 --> 31:14.939
it's nice to be chilled,
with the girls.

31:15.006 --> 31:16.441
Hope we have a good night.

31:16.507 --> 31:18.343
What happened?
I made up with her.

31:18.409 --> 31:21.579
But I wouldn't say I made friends
with her. Made up with her.

31:21.646 --> 31:24.048
Marnie does sound like
she forgives Zahida.

31:24.115 --> 31:26.784
Knowing her, she'll forgive,
but won't forget.

31:26.851 --> 31:29.854
Do you think
Abbie's gonna get the TD?

31:29.921 --> 31:32.724
She's dying for it,
but she wants to be cool, like me.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.926
She wants to wait.
Is that a joke?

31:34.993 --> 31:37.562
I'm sure you shagged Scott
on the second night.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.331
I'm sure you said
you loved him after a day!

31:40.398 --> 31:42.533
It was actually three, you freak!

31:42.600 --> 31:45.737
I know what Abbie's going through.
When I first got here,

31:45.803 --> 31:46.971
I really liked him,

31:47.038 --> 31:50.742
but he is a dick and he always knows
how to charm the girls.

31:50.808 --> 31:52.777
She's gonna get the D very soon.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.647
I seen them necking on
and it's very like that...

31:59.317 --> 32:02.387
Sarah's avoiding us,
but as I've got Abbie on her own,

32:02.453 --> 32:05.123
maybe now's a good time
to try and apologise.

32:05.189 --> 32:08.926
I think last night
it all just got a bit heated,

32:08.993 --> 32:12.130
and I am really, really sorry
that I got up and pushed you.

32:12.196 --> 32:16.167
But at that point I just saw red.
I hate Zahida for what she's done,

32:16.234 --> 32:20.171
but we're living in the same room
and I can't stay angry forever.

32:20.238 --> 32:23.941
I do accept your apology and I'm
sorry for getting violent as well.

32:24.008 --> 32:26.010
It shouldn't have got to that stage.

32:26.077 --> 32:29.180
Hopefully we can just go...
get past it.

32:29.247 --> 32:33.051
Abbie's accepted my apology,
but I still need to talk to Sarah.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.253
But I worry
winning her friendship back

32:35.320 --> 32:37.522
is gonna be a much harder challenge.

32:38.523 --> 32:39.891
(laughter)

32:45.797 --> 32:48.499
(Gaz) Ta-ra! Bye-bye!

32:48.566 --> 32:52.136
The girls have been doing
our heads in with all this fighting,

32:52.203 --> 32:54.839
so us lads are going to pre-drinks
without them.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.507
Bye, girls. In a bit.

33:03.214 --> 33:06.851
(Nathan) We've arrived, and it's
nice to be out with the boys.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.987
Let's get the drinks in,
cos it's lads' night!

33:11.489 --> 33:14.726
(Aaron) Me and the boys
are gonna do what boys do best.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.528
Have a few cheeky cocktails
and a little bitch.

33:33.010 --> 33:36.848
The newbies have been with us
so long, they feel like family.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.917
It's hard to believe
two of them will be gone for good.

33:42.153 --> 33:43.788
(cheering)

33:46.290 --> 33:49.360
Right, let's cheers to friendship,
and fixing them.

33:49.427 --> 33:51.696
(all) Cheers!
Woo-woo!

33:51.763 --> 33:54.966
Why are we raising a toast
to friendship? A bit of a joke

33:55.032 --> 33:58.503
cos I don't even know if my
friendship with Zahida is fixable.

33:58.569 --> 34:00.037
(laughs)
Right, let's go.

34:01.172 --> 34:02.640
Haway, lasses!

34:04.409 --> 34:07.879
I'm hoping that tonight everyone
makes up, has a good drink,

34:07.945 --> 34:09.914
and there's no fucking kick-offs.

34:11.748 --> 34:14.318
Abbie,
you're asking for it tonight.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.520
Oh, aye!

34:15.585 --> 34:18.222
Does this outfit just say
"Take me to shag pad"?

34:18.289 --> 34:21.958
All the lasses are going on about
Abbie getting it on with Scott,

34:22.025 --> 34:25.696
but if you ask me, she's a bit of
a mug. I'd rather dust Martin again

34:25.763 --> 34:27.465
than go anywhere near Scott.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.132
Oh, you'll have titties out!

34:30.768 --> 34:33.304
I reckon
tonight's gonna be a good one.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.139
I'll always love her.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.777
I'm gonna get snapped tonight!
Stop trying to make a fool out of me.

34:39.844 --> 34:42.980
Anything me and Martin do
has fuck all to do with her.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.416
(Nathan) I'm telling you
to shut the fuck up!

34:45.483 --> 34:47.452
Sometimes the girl needs tough love.

34:47.518 --> 34:50.455
I just hope that
after all that shit, it's worth it.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.492
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:56.960 --> 34:57.161
.

34:59.664 --> 34:59.864
.

35:12.543 --> 35:16.180
Me and the girls are having
a wicked time without the boys.

35:16.247 --> 35:18.816
But I can't help but wish
that Scott was here,

35:18.883 --> 35:22.253
cos now we've made up
I definitely want some fun tonight.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.222
Yeah!

35:24.288 --> 35:27.859
(cheering, shouting)
Woo-woo!

35:27.925 --> 35:29.260
'Before we get pissed,'

35:29.327 --> 35:32.463
I want to grab Sarah
and make sure we sort thigs out.

35:35.633 --> 35:37.668
Zahida has come over to talk to us

35:37.735 --> 35:40.104
and I'm interested in
what she's got to say.

35:57.755 --> 36:01.926
I'm gonna move on and be civil with
Zahida cos we've all made mistakes,

36:01.993 --> 36:04.862
and our friendship
is actually worth more than this,

36:04.929 --> 36:07.732
but it will take a while
to get back to how we were.

36:12.837 --> 36:16.707
I'm so relieved
that Sarah's willing to move on.

36:16.774 --> 36:20.311
I might not have my best friend
back, but at least this is a start.

36:32.590 --> 36:33.691
(all) Cheers!

36:35.693 --> 36:39.096
We're out having a really girly
time, having shots together,

36:39.163 --> 36:40.531
having a little dance,

36:40.598 --> 36:43.134
and here they come,
the schlong crew.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.402
Hello!

36:44.468 --> 36:45.903
Woo!

36:45.970 --> 36:50.341
Me and the lads have had pre-drinks
and I'm already fucking wankered.

36:50.408 --> 36:55.646
Sarah's looking fi-ine! I reckon
tonight's gonna be a good one.

37:14.332 --> 37:17.935
I don't know what it is, but me and
Aaron have got this flirty banter.

37:18.002 --> 37:21.572
It's harmless, doesn't mean
anything, but it'll always be there.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.178
You'd think hanging with your
ex would be weird. It's not.

37:27.244 --> 37:30.948
We are getting on so well.
I'll always love her.

37:31.015 --> 37:33.684
But, right now, as mates,
we're better than ever.

37:43.794 --> 37:46.564
I'm horny as fuck,
so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.634
I'm gonna get on to my ex-bird
and see what the craic is.

37:51.869 --> 37:53.404
(she laughs)

37:57.308 --> 38:01.145
I look over and see Marty and Sarah
blatantly flirting.

38:01.212 --> 38:03.347
I should be bothered,
but I fucking am.

38:11.155 --> 38:14.058
Marty's shown me
quite a bit of attention tonight,

38:14.125 --> 38:16.627
and I have been through a dry spell
recently,

38:16.694 --> 38:20.331
so maybe hooking up with my ex
isn't such a bad idea.

38:28.305 --> 38:30.174
Now everyone's happy and made up,

38:30.241 --> 38:32.610
it's time for me and Abbie
to bail this party

38:32.677 --> 38:34.745
and have our own disco
at the shag pad.

38:39.383 --> 38:41.485
I wanna spend the night with Scotty.

38:41.552 --> 38:43.988
We're in a better place
than we've ever been.

38:47.958 --> 38:51.662
Me and Abbie get back, and all I can
hear is screams from the shag pad.

38:51.729 --> 38:55.466
It's the sound of the bed thinking,
"I'm gonna get snapped tonight!"

38:59.804 --> 39:01.605
'Scotty is a dick.'

39:01.672 --> 39:05.176
'But I like his dick.
And I can't resist any more.'

39:09.113 --> 39:10.681
Abbie must be in her element.

39:10.748 --> 39:13.084
I know she enjoys
a few scoops of ice cream,

39:13.150 --> 39:15.619
But she didn't know
I was waiting till tonight

39:15.686 --> 39:18.289
to give her the full wafer,
with sprinkles.

39:28.399 --> 39:31.702
I've got a funny feeling
that I'm in here with my ex-bird,

39:31.769 --> 39:34.772
but something's telling me
I need to speak to Chloe.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.308
But she can't get mad at me
for being honest.

39:44.849 --> 39:48.986
One minute Marty said he loves us
and the next he wants to fuck his ex.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.655
Why the hell
is he playing my emotions for?

39:59.029 --> 40:00.664
I never thought I'd say this,

40:00.731 --> 40:04.001
but tonight we've had a good night
with minimal arguments,

40:04.068 --> 40:08.038
so let's get back to the house and,
hopefully, we'll keep it that way.

40:14.111 --> 40:17.548
I've had a wicked night
and there's only one thing

40:17.615 --> 40:20.518
that can top it off.
Loads of chips!

40:20.584 --> 40:23.521
I want some chips, chips, chips!

40:23.587 --> 40:25.556
Not well. I'm not well.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.096
Hey!

40:32.163 --> 40:35.566
We all get back to the house,
Abbie comes through the kitchen'

40:35.633 --> 40:38.102
and she's got a massive smile
on her face.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.037
You look happy, chappy, clappy.

40:40.104 --> 40:43.374
Fair play to Abbie, she looks like
she's had a good time,

40:43.440 --> 40:44.909
but I'm so angry with Marty

40:44.975 --> 40:47.344
for mugging us off
and playing my emotions.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.413
I can't keep it in any longer.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.816
Well,
I want to talk about this situation.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.854
Marty said to me, "I want to shag
Sarah tonight. It means nothing."

40:56.921 --> 40:59.523
I went, "All right, then."
I don't want to argue,

40:59.590 --> 41:03.260
but stop trying to make a fucking
fool out of us, mate. Right?

41:03.327 --> 41:07.064
We're having a laugh, then
Chloe kicks off about me and Sarah.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.600
What's the big deal?
You wanted a shag?

41:09.667 --> 41:10.734
I did.

41:10.801 --> 41:14.705
Right, yous go to the shag pad, then.
This doesn't need to be an argument.

41:14.772 --> 41:18.542
I dare yous. I dare Sarah and Marty
to go to the shag pad now.

41:18.609 --> 41:20.678
Chloe is getting very cheeky.

41:20.744 --> 41:23.214
And, at this point,
anything me and Martin do

41:23.280 --> 41:26.684
has fuck all to do with her,
so she can stay out of it.

41:26.750 --> 41:30.287
If you wanna shag her, shag her.
I will. Don't think I care about you

41:30.354 --> 41:35.059
cos I am... Mate, you hate the fact
that I'm over you. Cos I am over you!

41:35.125 --> 41:36.260
Chloe, get to bed!

41:36.327 --> 41:38.162
Right, that's it.

41:38.229 --> 41:42.199
Chloe, get the fuck upstairs before
you embarrass yourself even more.

41:42.266 --> 41:45.202
If you don't care,
don't fucking talk to him.

41:45.269 --> 41:48.772
Don't get angry, then you're not
bothered, know what I mean, babe?

41:48.839 --> 41:51.308
I'm getting angry
cos he thinks I am.

42:00.284 --> 42:04.054
I have had a shit time the past
couple of days in this house.

42:04.121 --> 42:07.157
And, even though, Chloe's going off,
Martin is my ex

42:07.224 --> 42:10.895
and I am feeling a little bit horny,
so I'm gonna treat myself.

42:14.598 --> 42:17.868
It's been a fucking while
since me and Sarah last banged.

42:17.935 --> 42:22.106
I'm canny horny. I just hope after
all the shit tonight, it's worth it.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.578
(Nathan) What you doing now?

42:27.645 --> 42:30.381
Arguing with you!
What the fuck are you doing now?

42:30.447 --> 42:32.983
You're kicking off with me
over Martin again.

42:33.050 --> 42:37.021
And I'm telling you to
shut the fuck up cos I don't care!

42:37.087 --> 42:38.088
So shut up!

42:38.155 --> 42:42.059
Nathan's right. I thought I was over
Marty, but him with another girl,

42:42.126 --> 42:44.862
I don't know if I can take it.
I'm so confused.

42:44.929 --> 42:49.266
If you don't care about him, then
why are you still talking about him?

42:49.333 --> 42:50.334
Because you care.

42:50.401 --> 42:54.438
I fucking lost it with Chloe, but
sometimes the girl needs tough love.

42:54.505 --> 42:57.574
I don't want to see her
mug herself off over Marty again.

43:01.478 --> 43:04.481
I had a rough time in here.
Treat yourself! (laughter)

43:04.548 --> 43:07.618
This could be awkward.
This is what I think of you...

43:07.685 --> 43:10.487
Open that door,
only one of yous is coming back.

43:10.554 --> 43:13.324
Kill or be killed, bitches.
All winners in my eyes.

43:13.390 --> 43:15.125
Here? Yes.
Here? Yes.

43:15.192 --> 43:16.527
Or here?

43:16.593 --> 43:18.362
Penis and kebab.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.164
Oh!

43:20.230 --> 43:23.734
All hail King Nathan's birthday!
(retches)

43:23.801 --> 43:26.437
I'm now an expert on the vagine.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.305
(girl) This is how it's done.

43:29.373 --> 43:30.507
(groaning)

43:30.574 --> 43:33.043
Finally, the wait's over! Who is it?

43:33.110 --> 43:34.611
(cheering)

43:34.678 --> 43:37.481
Why don't us all have a sleepover?

43:39.049 --> 43:41.318
Oh, your fanny's out!

43:41.385 --> 43:43.454
(indistinct shouting)

43:43.520 --> 43:45.122
It's time to fucking bounce.

43:45.189 --> 43:47.057
Stick a fork in me, mate.
I'm done.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.359
(laughter)

44:13.450 --> 44:13.650
.
