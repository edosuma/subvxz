00:00.545 --> 00:01.524
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.551 --> 00:03.151
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.485 --> 00:05.211
Psychopaths and mystery writers.

00:05.449 --> 00:06.471
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.872 --> 00:07.471
Who am I?

00:07.561 --> 00:08.700
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.701 --> 00:09.101
Castle.

00:09.135 --> 00:09.795
Castle.

00:09.796 --> 00:11.796
I really am ruggedly
handsome, aren't I?

00:11.942 --> 00:14.132
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.342 --> 00:15.161
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.196 --> 00:16.216
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.251 --> 00:18.157
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:18.203 --> 00:19.689
And thanks to my
friendship with the mayor,

00:19.690 --> 00:20.690
I get to be on her case.

00:20.724 --> 00:22.667
I would be happy to
let you spank me.

00:22.702 --> 00:23.578
And together, we catch killers

00:24.526 --> 00:25.514
we make a pretty good team,
you know?

00:25.515 --> 00:26.515
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:26.649 --> 00:27.343
Turner and Hooch.

00:27.706 --> 00:28.773
You do remind me a little of Hooch.

01:02.401 --> 01:04.200
aah!

01:04.202 --> 01:07.395
"A scream pierced the air,

01:07.515 --> 01:10.372
falling only on the
deaf ears of the dead."

01:11.550 --> 01:13.474
Really? A little too over the top?

01:13.839 --> 01:15.448
I think I've been writing too long

01:15.738 --> 01:18.329
not to know that it's "I"
before "E" except after "C."

01:18.746 --> 01:20.613
Ever heard of spell-check?
Yes, of course.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.680
She's got red hair,
she's wise beyond her years,

01:22.681 --> 01:24.615
and she's about to tell
her dad what she thinks

01:24.616 --> 01:26.002
of the latest chapter
of his new book.

01:26.239 --> 01:27.701
I loved it, especially the part

01:27.821 --> 01:29.537
with Nikki and Rook in
the aircraft carrier.

01:30.164 --> 01:32.258
Awesome. Stop it.
You're embarrassing me.

01:32.749 --> 01:34.035
I do have one note, though.

01:34.155 --> 01:36.804
This new character, the,
uh, robbery Detective...

01:37.158 --> 01:38.594
Schlemming. What about him?

01:38.922 --> 01:41.092
Well, he seems like he kinda
came up out of nowhere.

01:41.093 --> 01:42.496
Yeah, well,
I can't argue with that.

01:42.842 --> 01:44.511
He's coming off a
bit like a doofus.

01:44.631 --> 01:45.643
You think?

01:45.763 --> 01:47.045
I think you should lose him.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.059
If only it was this easy.

01:51.096 --> 01:52.284
Thank you for your help, sweetie.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.521
I am so behind on my deadline.

01:53.641 --> 01:55.565
That's 'cause you always find
new ways to procrastinate.

01:57.387 --> 01:58.879
Or they find me. Hello, mother.

01:59.570 --> 02:01.541
Oh, hi, guys. I can't stay.

02:01.542 --> 02:02.887
I'm just picking up a dress.

02:03.007 --> 02:05.033
Chet's taking me to the
theater this evening.

02:05.287 --> 02:06.358
Oh, what are you seeing?

02:06.478 --> 02:09.213
New Petrofsky play,
"Edge of Awakening."

02:09.214 --> 02:10.608
Wait a minute.
Didn't you audition for that?

02:10.728 --> 02:11.829
Uh-huh, yes.

02:11.949 --> 02:14.250
And that wonderful actress
Madge Vance got my part,

02:14.251 --> 02:15.783
the way she usually does.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.151
Well, she's not even
really your friend.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.956
It's nice that you go
and support her. I know.

02:19.076 --> 02:21.517
And... I have to go soon,
because it's closing.

02:21.637 --> 02:24.032
The critics are saying it's a...
"train wreck."

02:24.152 --> 02:26.203
Oh, there's the
Martha Rodgers I know.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.201
Ah, Beckett.

02:29.712 --> 02:31.072
Please tell me there's
been a murder,

02:31.192 --> 02:32.416
otherwise, I'll have
to continue writing.

02:39.986 --> 02:41.654
People always say they
want to die in their sleep.

02:41.774 --> 02:44.100
What you want is a good,
clean shot to take you out

02:44.220 --> 02:46.648
before you know what hit you.
Not this poor guy.

02:47.672 --> 02:50.273
Bullet missed the heart.
He didn't die for quite a while.

02:50.393 --> 02:51.679
Looks like he was

02:51.799 --> 02:52.706
reaching for the phone
to call for help.

02:52.826 --> 02:55.391
Until our doer took
<i>that</i> to his head.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.578
Probably didn't want to risk

02:57.579 --> 02:59.065
the neighbors hearing
a second shot,

02:59.185 --> 03:01.235
and so he grabbed the nearest
thing and finished him off.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.224
There's blood splatter on the clock--
must have been

03:04.344 --> 03:05.850
knocked off the nightstand
during the attack.

03:05.970 --> 03:08.553
10:34. At least we know what time

03:08.554 --> 03:09.793
the festivities started.

03:09.913 --> 03:10.922
There's no signs of forced entry.

03:11.042 --> 03:12.256
He probably left this open

03:12.257 --> 03:13.558
so he could get a
breath of fresh air.

03:14.243 --> 03:16.324
And there's no security
cameras either.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.488
And I didn't see any
on the way in. Mm.

03:18.608 --> 03:19.882
Cleaning lady found
him this morning.

03:20.002 --> 03:21.740
She said that usually,
Wilder would've left for work

03:21.860 --> 03:23.920
by the time she got here.
Wilder? Damian Wilder?

03:24.389 --> 03:26.157
Yeah, you know him? I know <i>of</i> him.

03:26.537 --> 03:28.566
This is a photo from one
of his ad campaigns.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.825
He--he runs a line of boutique
men's skincare products.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.474
You mean, like, bathroom stuff?

03:33.475 --> 03:35.409
He has got a toner,
totally alcohol-free,

03:35.410 --> 03:36.943
fantastic.

03:36.944 --> 03:39.230
He's got a shaving cream
that is ridiculous.

03:39.546 --> 03:41.043
I'm good with the
drug store stuff, man.

03:41.163 --> 03:42.129
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on.

03:42.249 --> 03:44.216
This stuff will change your life.

03:44.217 --> 03:45.684
It's hot. It's hot.

03:45.685 --> 03:47.518
It's hot? It's hot.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.361
It's hot. How do they do that?

03:49.481 --> 03:50.768
Magic of modern chemistry.

03:50.888 --> 03:52.822
It's like getting a
shave from a barber.

03:52.823 --> 03:55.668
Matter of fact, that's the tagline-
-barber in a can. Huh.

03:55.788 --> 03:56.973
So it's probably expensive, huh?

03:57.093 --> 03:58.872
It's 50 bucks a pop,
but it's so worth it.

03:59.176 --> 04:00.195
Absolutely. Totally. Yeah.

04:00.196 --> 04:02.864
Guys... a man has
been murdered here.

04:02.865 --> 04:05.662
And we are... honoring his legacy.

04:05.929 --> 04:08.247
Mm. It's like "Sex and the City,"

04:08.367 --> 04:09.628
only with boys.

04:09.907 --> 04:11.438
Maybe you guys can check
in with the neighbors,

04:11.439 --> 04:13.507
see if they saw or heard anything?

04:13.508 --> 04:15.042
Oh, yeah. All over it.

04:15.043 --> 04:17.543
Yeah, I'm on it. Come on, Castle.
Let me show you what I found.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.126
Something was stolen
from these cases.

04:23.885 --> 04:25.719
Hmm. Those are humidity controls.

04:26.138 --> 04:27.906
Well, whatever it was
was very valuable,

04:28.026 --> 04:29.722
because the killer
passed up the plasma tv

04:29.723 --> 04:31.189
and the blu-ray player.

04:31.190 --> 04:33.007
Robbery gone wrong?

04:33.438 --> 04:34.538
Looks that way, doesn't it?

04:35.070 --> 04:37.027
And then there's this.

04:39.256 --> 04:41.031
Is that an "E" or an "O"?

04:41.701 --> 04:43.067
"Murdero," is that
Spanish for murder?

04:43.068 --> 04:45.535
"Murdere." The killer was French.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.978
The thing I don't get about it

04:47.098 --> 04:48.942
is why would a thief take the time

04:49.062 --> 04:51.122
to write a message out
of our vic's blood?

04:51.388 --> 04:53.775
Especially that message.
I mean, we know it's murder.

04:53.776 --> 04:55.211
The dead body's kind of a giveaway.

04:55.705 --> 04:56.691
So we're still canvassing,

04:56.811 --> 04:58.953
but I thought you'd want
to hear this--neighbor said

04:59.073 --> 05:00.945
she was on her treadmill last
night listening to music.

05:01.065 --> 05:02.331
So she didn't hear the shot.

05:02.451 --> 05:04.385
No, but she did open her
back door to let the cat in,

05:04.386 --> 05:06.308
and she saw someone
hopping over the fence

05:06.428 --> 05:07.641
on their way out of Wilder's yard.

05:07.761 --> 05:08.657
You get a description?

05:08.777 --> 05:10.940
Yeah, "a foot disappearing
over the fence."

05:11.060 --> 05:12.274
Did you get a time at all?

05:12.394 --> 05:14.041
10:52 on the button.
It was still on her alarm box.

05:14.161 --> 05:16.095
She forget she'd set it
when she opened the door.

05:16.096 --> 05:18.797
So now we know what time last
night's festivities ended.

05:18.798 --> 05:19.769
10:52.

05:19.889 --> 05:21.667
All right, have C.S.U.
sweep for prints and fibers

05:21.787 --> 05:22.981
and make sure they hit
the backyard as well.

05:23.101 --> 05:24.060
You got it.

05:37.941 --> 05:38.908
Demming.

05:39.206 --> 05:40.275
Castle.

05:44.617 --> 05:47.055
You guys use, uh,
boards down in robbery?

05:47.638 --> 05:48.982
Sure, yeah.

05:50.172 --> 05:51.465
Well, come back tomorrow.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.886
It'll be full of all
sorts of murder-y stuff.

05:54.122 --> 05:56.956
Beckett asked me to assist
in the investigation, so...

05:56.957 --> 05:57.885
Really?

05:58.273 --> 05:59.772
Yeah, because of the
robbery component.

06:00.086 --> 06:01.359
Of course.

06:01.752 --> 06:04.052
I tracked down Wilder's next of kin,
his cousin Blake.

06:04.274 --> 06:05.623
He's in the interview lounge.

06:09.066 --> 06:11.967
You know how he got in the
business he did? Acne.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.870
As a teenager,
he had it something terrible.

06:14.871 --> 06:16.656
When he asked me to lend him
money to start up a business,

06:16.776 --> 06:19.346
I was happy to do it. He...

06:19.967 --> 06:22.062
He was one of the good ones.

06:22.302 --> 06:25.931
I mean, why somebody would do
something like this, I... mm.

06:26.856 --> 06:28.238
Blake,

06:28.606 --> 06:30.450
we were hoping that you could
help us with something.

06:30.451 --> 06:32.385
The display cases
in the living room

06:32.386 --> 06:34.521
were broken into and their
contents were missing.

06:34.522 --> 06:36.455
Well, that's where
he kept his books.

06:36.456 --> 06:38.323
He was a collector-
rare printings,

06:38.324 --> 06:40.258
signed first editions,
things like that.

06:40.259 --> 06:41.878
Those could run into the thousands,

06:41.998 --> 06:44.830
even tens of thousands.
So it was robbery?

06:44.831 --> 06:46.898
Somebody killed him
to take his books?

06:46.899 --> 06:48.405
Well, it's possible
there's another motive.

06:48.525 --> 06:49.902
We found a message
written on the wall.

06:50.586 --> 06:51.539
That's odd.

06:51.659 --> 06:53.871
We're still working on that.
What we could really use

06:53.872 --> 06:55.840
your help on is with
the missing books.

06:55.841 --> 06:57.553
Did he have a catalog
of his collection?

06:57.673 --> 06:59.018
Sure. Damian looked to me

06:59.138 --> 07:00.911
to help him out with the
business side of things.

07:00.912 --> 07:02.371
The insurer he used
is a friend of mine.

07:02.491 --> 07:04.170
He'll have a catalog.
Well, as far as we know,

07:04.290 --> 07:06.431
the only thing missing were
the books, which suggests

07:06.551 --> 07:08.453
the perpetrator went there
knowing what he was looking for.

07:08.757 --> 07:10.735
Could be he had an opportunity
to case the apartment.

07:11.026 --> 07:11.860
Well, the kitchen--

07:11.980 --> 07:13.921
I mean, Damian had the
entire thing renovated.

07:14.327 --> 07:16.606
The place was crawling
with workers for weeks.

07:18.246 --> 07:20.210
Killed for a fortune
in stolen books.

07:20.863 --> 07:23.421
So I'll run the work crews and
see if anybody has priors.

07:23.967 --> 07:25.523
Thanks, Tom. I appreciate
your help on this.

07:25.865 --> 07:27.137
I'll let you know if
anything turns up.

07:30.422 --> 07:32.161
I'm not sure why everybody's
jumping to the conclusion

07:32.281 --> 07:33.609
that this murder was
about the stolen books.

07:33.610 --> 07:35.510
Maybe because they're missing.

07:35.879 --> 07:38.413
The message on the mirror
suggests an intention to kill,

07:38.414 --> 07:40.189
a motive of some kind.

07:40.658 --> 07:43.216
Stealing books-
just a crime of opportunity.

07:43.217 --> 07:45.485
And now who's jumping
to conclusions?

07:45.486 --> 07:47.947
I just hate to see
anybody waste their time.

07:48.378 --> 07:50.589
The key here is the message,
not the books.

07:50.907 --> 07:53.293
I think we should pursue
both lines of investigation.

07:53.521 --> 07:55.893
Well, he's your boyfriend.
Excuse me?

07:55.894 --> 07:58.162
I'm sorry. Am I jumping
to conclusions again?

07:58.163 --> 07:59.697
It's none of your business.

08:00.362 --> 08:01.784
Yo.

08:02.544 --> 08:04.367
Ran a background check on Wilder.

08:04.813 --> 08:05.868
Found this incident report

08:05.869 --> 08:07.904
that he filed with the
police three days ago.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.338
Somebody vandalized his apartment.

08:09.544 --> 08:11.232
Poured red paint
all over his stoop.

08:11.465 --> 08:14.077
Yeah, it turns out that, uh,
his company was being picketed

08:14.078 --> 08:15.712
by animal rights protestors.

08:15.713 --> 08:17.814
But all of his stuff is labeled "
no animal testing."

08:17.815 --> 08:20.133
The problem was with, uh,
one of his subcontractors,

08:20.253 --> 08:21.923
who was doing some of the
manufacturing for him.

08:22.515 --> 08:23.736
Wilder didn't even know about it.

08:24.355 --> 08:25.700
That's what the message was.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.932
It wasn't misspelled.
It was unfinished.

08:29.457 --> 08:30.823
They were writing "murderer.
" So you think

08:30.943 --> 08:33.082
that one of the animal
rights activists killed him.

08:33.203 --> 08:35.596
Sure. One of them had enough
with the fake blood, decided,

08:35.716 --> 08:37.421
"I'm gonna send a message
using the real thing."

08:37.726 --> 08:39.511
Maybe we should pay
Wilder's office a visit

08:39.727 --> 08:41.866
and find out more about
those protestors.

We were looking for
another manufacturer

09:08.412 --> 09:10.413
to replace the one
we had been using.

09:10.414 --> 09:12.005
But apparently,
we weren't doing it fast enough

09:12.125 --> 09:13.298
for these protestors.

09:13.418 --> 09:15.496
Mr. Wilder wanted to
do the right thing.

09:16.121 --> 09:18.373
He really did. He just
needed a little more time.

09:18.855 --> 09:21.084
The paint throwing incident at
Damian's house Thursday night

09:21.085 --> 09:22.303
was the last straw.

09:22.786 --> 09:24.683
He scheduled a press
conference for this morning.

09:25.021 --> 09:27.835
He hadn't told anybody,
but he was planning to announce

09:27.955 --> 09:30.183
a substantial donation to
the animal rights movement

09:31.003 --> 09:33.155
as a sign of the
company's good faith.

09:33.362 --> 09:34.893
They got everything they wanted,

09:35.485 --> 09:36.731
but they killed him anyway.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.780
Well, to be , Ms. Jenkins,
we don't know that definitively.

09:40.264 --> 09:43.359
The incident on Thursday,
that the first time

09:43.603 --> 09:45.177
that Mr. Wilder had been
targeted personally?

09:45.297 --> 09:47.195
Usually, they just picket
outside the building.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.688
It got so bad,

09:48.808 --> 09:51.275
we actually hired a private
security firm for a while

09:51.276 --> 09:53.994
to run down some of the
threats we got in the mail.

09:54.281 --> 09:55.681
Is there a chance
we could take a look

09:55.801 --> 09:57.278
at the information they developed?
It could be helpful.

09:57.398 --> 09:58.686
Of course. Yeah.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.032
Daphne will put it
together for you.

10:00.152 --> 10:02.699
We'll also need to see a copy of Mr.
Wilder's date book

10:02.819 --> 10:03.900
for the last couple of weeks.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.208
Absolutely. Anything you need.

10:07.759 --> 10:09.078
Here you go, Sir.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.660
I cannot believe that
you asked for samples.

10:12.661 --> 10:13.853
She said anything we needed.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.391
Besides, it's not for me.
It's for Ryan and Esposito.

10:16.511 --> 10:17.818
Don't you mean
Charlotte and Miranda?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.696
Wait a minute.
That would make me Carrie.

10:20.423 --> 10:22.993
You're so metrosexual
for even knowing that.

10:23.113 --> 10:24.103
I only watched that show

10:24.223 --> 10:25.613
out of the corner of my eye
when my mother had it on.

10:26.362 --> 10:27.761
That so did not come out right.

10:28.816 --> 10:31.040
According to these notes from
the private security firm,

10:31.292 --> 10:33.301
most of these folks seem
like average, everyday,

10:33.421 --> 10:34.691
tree-hugging vegetarians.

10:34.811 --> 10:36.785
I mean, so far,
the worst any of them has done

10:36.905 --> 10:38.727
is break into a lab to
free a bunch of mice.

10:39.050 --> 10:40.089
You come up with anything?

10:40.262 --> 10:42.259
There are a handful
of recent entries

10:42.379 --> 10:44.854
in Wilder's calendar for
someone named Natasha.

10:45.420 --> 10:47.075
Could be someone that
he started dating.

10:47.308 --> 10:48.958
Hey. Hey.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.360
So I ran the workmen who
renovated your vic's kitchen.

10:51.361 --> 10:52.379
And one of 'em popped.

10:53.179 --> 10:54.650
Meet Jake Cabrese.

10:54.770 --> 10:55.719
Two of the apartments

10:55.839 --> 10:57.549
he worked on in the past
year were later robbed.

10:57.845 --> 11:00.079
He was a person of interest
in both investigations,

11:00.199 --> 11:01.151
but neither of them made.

11:01.271 --> 11:02.471
Sounds like someone
we should talk to.

11:02.591 --> 11:03.947
Well, we're running down his
whereabouts as we speak.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.386
Aha! Meet Lance Newman--

11:06.506 --> 11:08.498
arrested five times
for violent agitation.

11:08.618 --> 11:11.645
His favorite tool of protest-
the bucket of fake blood.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.361
Isn't fake blood kind of a
staple with these types?

11:14.576 --> 11:16.038
Last month, he painted
the word "murderer"

11:16.158 --> 11:18.816
on a Congressman's car because
he voted against a fishing ban.

11:18.817 --> 11:21.018
When the driver tried to stop him,
Newman bashed him

11:21.019 --> 11:22.591
in the side of the head
with his paint bucket.

11:22.886 --> 11:24.663
You know, I'd like him more
if we could find something

11:24.783 --> 11:26.246
that would connect him with our vic

11:26.366 --> 11:27.878
You mean like the string
of violent letters

11:27.998 --> 11:31.403
he wrote to Wilder...
sent to his home address?

11:32.149 --> 11:34.149
Nice job, Castle.
Let's go pick him up.

11:34.269 --> 11:35.844
Yeah. Let's.

11:36.508 --> 11:38.807
Mm.

11:40.860 --> 11:42.322
You've got the wrong guy.

11:42.442 --> 11:43.797
Last Thursday night,

11:43.917 --> 11:46.052
someone pours fake blood
all over Wilder's stoop.

11:46.053 --> 11:47.313
Three days later, he ends up dead.

11:47.433 --> 11:49.223
It does not take a genius
to make the connection.

11:49.343 --> 11:50.755
Yeah, but I didn't kill him.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.847
Look, I-I told you already.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.190
I went to the movies Sunday night.

11:54.310 --> 11:56.740
Yes, yes, yes. We have someone
running down that alibi.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.751
What about Thursday?
You got one for then, too?

11:58.871 --> 12:00.866
Thursday... I don't remember.

12:01.276 --> 12:02.980
Well, then how about you
spend the night in lockup?

12:03.100 --> 12:05.046
Might refresh your memory.

12:06.122 --> 12:08.198
Last Thursday, I went over
there with the paint--

12:08.318 --> 12:10.136
bam! So you admit that it was you

12:10.256 --> 12:11.535
who vandalized Wilder's apartment?

12:11.655 --> 12:12.658
Castle.

12:12.778 --> 12:16.323
<i>Yes. Okay.</i> I-I threw paint
on his stoop,

12:16.650 --> 12:17.759
which is then when I heard him

12:17.983 --> 12:19.649
fighting with someone
inside, a woman.

12:19.769 --> 12:21.532
They were throwing stuff,

12:21.652 --> 12:23.186
and I really thought they
were gonna kill each other.

12:23.306 --> 12:24.519
Did you see who she was?

12:24.639 --> 12:26.364
No. I just heard them yelling.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.009
And what exactly did you overhear?

12:28.129 --> 12:31.635
She said something
about being humiliated,

12:31.636 --> 12:33.860
and he said something about a gun.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.006
A gun?

12:36.007 --> 12:38.181
"You put a gun to my head,
" I think it was.

12:38.301 --> 12:39.827
Okay, now you're
just making stuff up.

12:45.520 --> 12:46.631
Well, Mr. Newman,
good thing you used

12:46.751 --> 12:48.619
the automated ticket booth
at the theater Sunday night.

12:49.481 --> 12:51.014
Your alibi checked out.

12:51.015 --> 12:53.249
Really? Really?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.249
Really

12:56.616 --> 12:57.872
Okay, thanks.

12:57.992 --> 13:00.821
Check this out.
According to his calendar,

13:01.096 --> 13:03.323
Wilder had dinner with this
Natasha person Thursday night.

13:03.623 --> 13:05.077
Could be that she's the person

13:05.197 --> 13:06.644
our animal-loving friend
was talking about.

13:06.764 --> 13:08.684
I thought you said that
he was making all that up.

13:09.295 --> 13:10.550
That was--

13:10.670 --> 13:12.544
that was Wilder's
assistant on the phone.

13:13.174 --> 13:14.343
Apparently...

13:14.463 --> 13:17.601
Wilder and Natasha Piper had
started dating recently.

13:18.672 --> 13:19.817
The girl from the print ads?

13:19.937 --> 13:22.169
Yep. And she said she was
a real piece of work.

13:22.289 --> 13:24.167
Tore up a set at a photo
shoot a couple of weeks ago

13:24.287 --> 13:25.819
because they had the wrong
bottled water for her.

13:26.117 --> 13:27.370
Well, it seems like a
good bet she was the one

13:27.490 --> 13:28.709
fighting with Wilder
Thursday night.

13:28.829 --> 13:30.095
Yeah. Could be she
went back on Sunday

13:30.215 --> 13:31.495
to get one last word in.

13:32.104 --> 13:33.283
I should pick her
up in the morning.

13:33.403 --> 13:34.494
Hey.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.026
Hey, how did things
go with the workman?

13:36.324 --> 13:37.986
Well, found him
sitting in his garage

13:38.106 --> 13:40.734
on a couple of g's worth of
stolen power tools, but...

13:41.636 --> 13:42.680
the night of the murder,
it turns out

13:42.800 --> 13:44.703
he was watching his kids
in a play at church, so...

13:44.939 --> 13:47.078
Yeah, it's been that
kind of a day. Yeah.

13:47.463 --> 13:49.042
You ready to go? Ready.

13:49.776 --> 13:51.202
Thought we were knocking
it off for the night.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.977
We are. We're just,
um, sharing a cab.

13:55.336 --> 13:56.769
Night, Castle.

13:56.770 --> 13:59.104
Night. Night.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.078
Hey. How was the play?

14:07.198 --> 14:08.490
Oh, awful.

14:08.610 --> 14:09.961
Well, that must've made you happy.

14:10.495 --> 14:11.887
You know what the worst part was?

14:12.670 --> 14:15.418
It's badness made
Madge's performance

14:15.419 --> 14:16.852
all that much better.

14:16.853 --> 14:18.320
She was wonderful.

14:18.321 --> 14:20.407
She was... like a revelation.

14:21.337 --> 14:22.890
Oh, mother. I'm sorry.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.149
Thank you.

14:24.734 --> 14:26.496
You know, I went into
the theater thinking,

14:26.795 --> 14:29.307
yeah, she kinda snaked that
part out from under me.

14:29.427 --> 14:31.686
But then... I hate to admit it.

14:31.806 --> 14:33.136
She deserved to get it.

14:33.256 --> 14:34.913
I'm sure you would've been
terrific in that role.

14:35.033 --> 14:37.077
Aw, you are so sweet.

14:37.976 --> 14:39.183
But you know something, darling?

14:39.303 --> 14:41.056
In life, you just have
to accept the fact

14:41.304 --> 14:43.788
that not everything
is gonna go your way.

14:52.783 --> 14:54.703
Thank you so much for
coming in, Ms. Piper.

14:58.086 --> 15:01.221
First of all, let me say that
I am so sorry for your loss.

15:01.669 --> 15:03.423
Yeah. Don't be.

15:03.424 --> 15:05.626
Uh, how long had the two of
you been seeing each other?

15:06.037 --> 15:08.955
I don't know. Two months?
Does it really matter?

15:10.211 --> 15:11.280
Apparently not.

15:11.693 --> 15:14.006
If you ask me, he got
exactly what he deserved.

15:14.126 --> 15:15.072
Really?

15:16.067 --> 15:17.316
Yeah. Really.

15:17.758 --> 15:18.902
Bullet in the chest.

15:19.022 --> 15:20.353
Don't forget about
the bludgeoning part.

15:20.473 --> 15:21.553
Oh, how could I?

15:21.673 --> 15:23.090
Right upside his little head.

15:23.438 --> 15:24.705
So why did you do it?

15:25.464 --> 15:26.968
You seriously think I did this?

15:28.113 --> 15:31.015
I read about it in the paper,
but he did have it coming.

15:31.016 --> 15:32.883
Can you believe that
that little toad

15:32.884 --> 15:35.144
was cheating on me? Me?

15:36.097 --> 15:38.920
Okay, so why don't we just
start from the beginning?

15:39.293 --> 15:40.814
Where were you the night
that he was killed?

15:41.063 --> 15:42.721
On Sunday, I was in the Hamptons.

15:43.032 --> 15:44.542
I took the Jitney
out in the morning

15:44.662 --> 15:46.351
and sat next to Perez
Hilton of all people.

15:46.961 --> 15:49.236
He blogged all about it.
You can check yourself.

15:49.703 --> 15:50.685
Well, we have a witness

15:50.805 --> 15:52.969
who says that Mr.
Wilder argued with a woman

15:52.970 --> 15:55.222
in his apartment on Thursday.
Was that you?

15:55.342 --> 15:57.061
No, that wasn't me.

15:57.297 --> 15:58.957
So it probably means
that he was with her.

15:59.654 --> 16:02.014
The bitch that he was two-timing me with,
the one from the motel.

16:02.134 --> 16:04.916
What motel? Ah,
he did blog about it.

16:05.587 --> 16:06.937
You two ate at the
Southampton Grill?

16:07.057 --> 16:08.662
I love that place. Castle.

16:11.131 --> 16:12.714
What motel? The one in Jersey

16:12.834 --> 16:14.475
that I followed him
to Thursday morning.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.547
I was right. He was cheating on me.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.179
With who? I don't know.

16:19.661 --> 16:21.495
He went up to the corner
room on the second floor.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.442
I didn't stick around to watch.
So you can't be sure

16:24.562 --> 16:25.971
that it was a woman that
he was meeting with.

16:26.091 --> 16:27.589
No, but why else would he be there?

16:28.170 --> 16:29.700
And just for the record,
she's gotta be

16:29.820 --> 16:31.876
some kind of dirty skank,
'cause that place was a dump.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.342
A cheap skank... At a rundown motel

16:37.343 --> 16:40.372
is actually a better lead
than an angry ex-girlfriend.

16:41.156 --> 16:43.382
And a much better lead
than stolen books.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.248
What was that?

16:46.057 --> 16:48.354
I said... my, don't you gentlemen

16:48.355 --> 16:49.832
look clean-shaven today?

16:49.952 --> 16:50.723
Yeah, sweet stuff, bro.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.262
Yeah, Jenny said my face never
felt so smooth. Barber in a can.

16:53.263 --> 16:55.197
Mm-hmm. Okay, guys. Got it.

16:55.577 --> 16:56.911
Comes out hot. Castle?

16:57.135 --> 17:00.234
Oh, yeah, uh, nothing unusual
in Wilder's financials.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.611
His call records were clean, too.

17:01.731 --> 17:03.474
No calls except to
places you would expect.

17:03.594 --> 17:04.987
Ballistics report
came back negative.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.609
No unusual fibers or fingerprints

17:06.730 --> 17:07.915
in the apartment
or backyard either.

17:08.036 --> 17:09.142
All right, talk to
the neighbors again.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.718
Find out if any of them
remember seeing him

17:10.838 --> 17:13.335
with a woman Thursday night.
Okay. Dude...

17:13.454 --> 17:15.044
Hey.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.939
I'm wondering why a man
as wealthy as Wilder

17:18.387 --> 17:21.080
would choose a cheap motel
in Jersey to have a tryst.

17:22.056 --> 17:24.058
Maybe there's more going
on than just a tryst.

17:32.303 --> 17:34.904
His name is Damian Wilder.

17:34.905 --> 17:37.532
Never seen him before.
But I wasn't on duty.

17:37.652 --> 17:38.688
Benny was.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.219
Well, I'd like to talk with Benny.

17:40.339 --> 17:42.193
So would I. He didn't
show up for work today,

17:42.313 --> 17:44.220
which is why I'm here
covering on my day off.

17:44.340 --> 17:45.885
Do you have contact info for him?

17:46.731 --> 17:48.110
The corner room, second floor,

17:48.230 --> 17:49.545
who stayed in there last Thursday?

17:49.665 --> 17:53.091
Oh, let's see. Paid cash up front,
four nights.

17:53.211 --> 17:55.407
Name was... Scarlett O'Hara.

17:56.265 --> 17:58.031
Scarlett O'Hara?

17:59.246 --> 18:01.596
She's... a fictional character.

18:02.195 --> 18:03.754
It's that kind of place.

18:05.831 --> 18:07.999
Okay. Thanks.

18:08.268 --> 18:10.568
Benny's roommate said that
he came home from his shift,

18:10.688 --> 18:12.506
packed a bag and left in a hurry.

18:12.626 --> 18:14.418
Is it just me, or is the
timing a little suspicious?

18:14.538 --> 18:16.392
I'm gonna put a want out
for him in the system.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.444
He's gotta be there somewhere.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.419
You know, the clerk said

18:18.539 --> 18:20.421
our mystery woman rented
the room for four nights.

18:20.541 --> 18:22.552
Wilder's calendar was pretty
packed the whole time.

18:22.672 --> 18:24.953
It's hard to figure him getting
back out there to see her.

18:25.073 --> 18:26.654
So why did she rent
it for that long?

18:26.952 --> 18:28.146
What was going on out there?

18:28.266 --> 18:29.548
Breaking news.

18:29.668 --> 18:31.426
Guess what just turned
up for sale online?

18:31.824 --> 18:33.490
A first edition
"Catcher in the Rye"

18:33.610 --> 18:35.576
and a signed "
For Whom the Bell Tolls."

18:35.696 --> 18:38.200
I take it those are both
items in Wilder's collection.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.911
Bingo. The site belonged
to a rare book dealer.

18:41.031 --> 18:43.603
Goes by the name of Lukas Canby.
He's got a jacket

18:43.723 --> 18:46.376
for dealing in stolen property
<i>and</i> last month,

18:46.496 --> 18:48.355
he was arrested for
assaulting another book dealer

18:48.475 --> 18:50.017
at an auction that
didn't go his way.

18:50.137 --> 18:51.846
So he's got a history of violence

18:51.966 --> 18:53.446
and possession of
our vic's property.

18:53.707 --> 18:54.493
You care to sit in

18:54.613 --> 18:56.105
while I get him to confess
to Wilder's murder?

18:56.225 --> 18:58.044
Don't mind if I do.

19:03.346 --> 19:05.346
You care to sit in

19:05.347 --> 19:06.773
while I get him to confess
to Wilder's murder?

19:09.973 --> 19:12.014
$50,000 worth of books

19:12.015 --> 19:14.201
goes missing from a
dead man's apartment,

19:14.321 --> 19:16.156
Turns up in your possession.

19:16.442 --> 19:17.984
<i>You can see how that's a problem,
can't you, Lukas?</i>

19:18.810 --> 19:21.285
<i>You want to explain what happened? Sure.</i>

19:22.058 --> 19:23.376
But you'll never believe me.

19:23.886 --> 19:25.508
Try us.

19:25.628 --> 19:27.226
I bought 'em from
some guy in the park.

19:28.756 --> 19:30.050
In the park?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.807
Near the 76th street entrance.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.567
This homeless looking guy had
'em laid out on a blanket.

19:34.687 --> 19:36.448
Didn't have a clue
what they were worth.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.748
Gave him 100 bucks
for the whole lot.

19:39.037 --> 19:40.890
Man, was I feeling lucky that day.

19:41.127 --> 19:43.166
Yeah, that's how I felt when
I followed that leprechaun

19:43.286 --> 19:44.289
<i>to his pot of gold.</i>

19:44.409 --> 19:46.652
<i>Mm. I didn't steal those books,</i>

19:46.772 --> 19:48.457
<i>and I most certainly didn't
kill anybody.</i>

19:49.065 --> 19:50.967
It was this homeless guy.
Had to be.

19:51.087 --> 19:52.317
Beckett) Really? Yeah.

19:52.437 --> 19:54.671
You expect us to believe that he
broke in to Wilder's apartment,

19:54.791 --> 19:56.897
killed him for $50,
000 worth of books

19:57.017 --> 19:58.567
just to sell it to
you for 100 bucks?

19:58.687 --> 19:59.976
Doesn't add up, pal.

20:00.096 --> 20:01.381
Where were you Sunday night?

20:01.642 --> 20:03.937
Home... alone.

20:04.977 --> 20:07.808
Well, I wouldn't worry.
You won't be alone in your cell.

20:08.331 --> 20:10.146
Rikers is overcrowded these days.

20:16.487 --> 20:17.719
Let's have C.S.U.

20:17.839 --> 20:19.447
Take samples from Lukas'
apartment and office,

20:19.671 --> 20:21.173
run them against
what they recovered.

20:21.293 --> 20:23.227
Might be something that puts
them at the crime scene, yeah.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.046
In the meantime,

20:24.166 --> 20:25.721
we should check on his story
about the homeless guy,

20:25.841 --> 20:28.432
just in case. It's a nice
day to be out in the park.

20:28.552 --> 20:29.924
Can I buy you a hot dog?

20:33.366 --> 20:35.319
They're supposed to be
finding that homeless guy.

20:35.439 --> 20:36.661
I don't know how
they're gonna do that

20:36.781 --> 20:38.211
when all they can do is make
goo-goo eyes at each other.

20:38.331 --> 20:39.213
Beckett's a good cop.

20:39.333 --> 20:40.501
She can canvass and make
goo-goo eyes at the same time.

20:40.621 --> 20:42.545
Maybe we should call the motel,
see if Benny's turned up.

20:42.665 --> 20:44.964
I just called ten minutes ago.
Besides, chance are,

20:45.084 --> 20:46.796
this book guy that Demming's
got in the lockup did it.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.162
Oh, don't say that.

20:48.282 --> 20:50.806
What? <i>Oh.</i>

20:50.926 --> 20:53.680
You want to be the one to crack it,
not Demming, right?

20:53.800 --> 20:55.235
Well, the guy is not even homicide.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.690
Doesn't that bug you just a little?

20:56.810 --> 20:57.998
Maybe a little.

20:58.570 --> 21:00.822
But that's not why
it bugs you, is it?

21:00.942 --> 21:03.244
Yo. Just heard back
from the phone company.

21:03.364 --> 21:05.312
Only one call came
into the motel room

21:05.432 --> 21:07.034
during the four days that it
was rented to Scarlett O'Hara.

21:07.154 --> 21:08.581
Ooh, let me guess.
Rhett Butler, right?

21:08.954 --> 21:10.520
Rhett Butler? See at I did there?

21:10.831 --> 21:12.926
Call lasted two minutes.
Came in around the same time

21:13.046 --> 21:14.530
that Wilder's ex said
he went up to the room.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.160
Well, the only one who
would've known Wilder was there

21:16.280 --> 21:17.481
would've been the woman
planning to meet him.

21:17.601 --> 21:18.875
Maybe she called to say
she was running late.

21:18.995 --> 21:20.097
Yeah, well,
here's the money part...

21:20.217 --> 21:22.088
The call came...

21:22.499 --> 21:23.948
from Wilder's company.

21:24.172 --> 21:25.745
He was having an affair
with someone from work.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.987
Yeah, but unfortunately,
the way that they route the calls,

21:28.248 --> 21:30.240
we were only able to narrow
it down to an extension

21:30.360 --> 21:31.337
on the third floor of his building.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.684
Well, and we can
rule out all the men,

21:32.804 --> 21:33.766
since we know Scarlett was a woman.

21:33.886 --> 21:35.404
Yeah, and most likely,
it was the woman

21:35.524 --> 21:36.983
that Wilder was fighting
with at his apartment.

21:37.103 --> 21:38.748
There's gotta be a way we
can figure out who it was.

21:39.547 --> 21:40.940
We could do a sound lineup. Mm.

21:41.060 --> 21:41.741
Sound lineup?

21:41.861 --> 21:43.382
Yeah, we bring in the guy
who overheard the argument,

21:43.502 --> 21:44.732
have him listen to voice
samples from all the women

21:44.852 --> 21:46.197
on the third floor,
see if he recognizes any of 'em.

21:46.317 --> 21:47.380
You can do that? Mm-hmm.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.963
We don't even need to
bring any of the women in.

21:49.083 --> 21:51.099
We can patch into the voice mail system,
pull samples from there.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.544
You guys, if this works,

21:52.664 --> 21:54.125
I'll keep you both in
shave cream for a year.

21:55.717 --> 21:56.724
Deal.

21:56.844 --> 21:58.454
Mm-hmm. Yo.

22:04.369 --> 22:05.625
You found him?

22:05.745 --> 22:06.628
Take a seat.

22:06.748 --> 22:09.766
Yeah, we got lucky.
Apparently, Marty the junkie here,

22:09.886 --> 22:11.632
is a permanent fixture
in that part of the park.

22:11.968 --> 22:14.445
He was panhandling right about
where Lukas said he bought books.

22:14.565 --> 22:17.194
Which Marty's already admitted
to selling to him for 100 bucks.

22:17.809 --> 22:19.622
Has he admitted to breaking
into Wilder's apartment?

22:19.742 --> 22:21.162
Well, that's where
things get interesting.

22:21.282 --> 22:23.202
His alibi for the
break-in is solid.

22:23.322 --> 22:25.065
He picked up a few extra
bucks at a soup kitchen,

22:25.185 --> 22:26.287
cleaning up after hours.

22:26.407 --> 22:28.244
Claims he found the
books in a garbage can.

22:28.364 --> 22:29.890
Says he saw somebody
dumping them there

22:30.010 --> 22:31.016
a couple hours after our murder.

22:31.136 --> 22:33.522
Which, pretty good bet, <i>that</i>.
is our killer.

22:33.759 --> 22:35.052
I'm gonna sit him do
with a sketch artist now.

22:35.172 --> 22:36.892
Come on, Marty

22:41.115 --> 22:42.495
Any leads on our mystery woman?

22:42.615 --> 22:43.747
Actually, yes.

22:45.588 --> 22:47.046
<i>Hey, you've reached Katie Marks.</i>

22:47.166 --> 22:48.222
<i>I'm not at my desk right now.</i>

22:48.342 --> 22:50.796
<i>Leave a message, and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.</i>

22:50.916 --> 22:52.432
That's not her. Okay.
I will cue to the next one.

22:52.552 --> 22:55.727
Okay. I will cue to the next one.

22:55.847 --> 22:57.246
So did Marty definitely
say he got a good look

22:57.366 --> 22:59.007
at who it was that tossed the books?
Pretty good, yeah.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.154
Hopefully, one of these
two leads will pan out.

23:02.274 --> 23:02.888
<i> </i>

23:03.008 --> 23:04.916
Yeah, hopefully.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.078
I'm gonna go and
check on that sketch.

23:07.198 --> 23:09.242
<i>Leave a message or try my cell.</i>

23:11.381 --> 23:13.122
Okay, how about this one?

23:13.242 --> 23:14.542
<i>Hi, this is Jane.</i>

23:14.662 --> 23:16.109
<i>I'm away from my desk,
please leave a message.</i>

23:17.511 --> 23:18.829
No dice, huh?

23:18.949 --> 23:21.186
<i>You've reached Sophie.
I can't ta your call right n</i>

23:21.306 --> 23:23.471
<i>so leave your name and number</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

23:23.591 --> 23:25.088
<i>Next one.</i>

23:25.208 --> 23:26.796
Only three more.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.175
<i>Hi this is Lisa Jenkins.</i>

23:29.295 --> 23:31.155
<i>If you've reached this, that means
I'm out of the office.</i>

23:31.275 --> 23:33.182
<i>Please leave a message.
That's her.</i>

23:35.663 --> 23:36.955
Lisa Jenkins?

23:37.075 --> 23:39.003
That's the woman we
interviewed. You sure?

23:39.123 --> 23:40.474
Yeah, I'm positive.

23:42.190 --> 23:43.821
Remember our deal, Castle.

23:43.941 --> 23:45.376
It was Lisa Jenkins.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.347
Wilder was fighting with Lisa...

23:47.467 --> 23:49.400
That's a pretty solid likeness.
Yeah, right?

23:49.520 --> 23:50.880
What?

23:51.452 --> 23:52.503
Oh, it's Marty's sketch

23:52.623 --> 23:54.248
of the man he saw
tossing the books...

23:55.624 --> 23:57.527
Wilder's cousin--Blake.

24:03.125 --> 24:05.515
So we have a witness who says
that he heard Lisa Jenkins

24:05.635 --> 24:07.794
in a knock-down-drag-out
with Wilder,

24:07.914 --> 24:09.431
and another one says

24:09.551 --> 24:11.139
that he saw Wilder's
cousin dumping his books.

24:11.259 --> 24:14.022
But what we don't have from
either suspect is motive.

24:14.142 --> 24:17.710
Easy. Lisa's affair
with Wilder went south.

24:17.711 --> 24:19.679
They could no longer work
together side by side,

24:19.680 --> 24:21.112
and she didn't want to
have to quit her job.

24:22.256 --> 24:23.400
Detective Demming?

24:23.520 --> 24:25.004
Oh, you know, it could be anything.

24:25.124 --> 24:26.806
I don't know. Maybe Blake
didn't like the fact

24:26.926 --> 24:28.737
that Wilder grew up to be
more successful than him.

24:29.470 --> 24:31.171
You bet he was sick of
getting beat at golf

24:32.968 --> 24:35.335
Golf, really?
To be honest with you,

24:35.455 --> 24:37.461
I'm not that concerned
about a motive right now.

24:37.581 --> 24:40.179
I've got an eyewitness that
saw him tossing his cousin's

24:40.299 --> 24:41.945
prize book collection
the night of the murder.

24:42.065 --> 24:42.902
I have a witness, too.

24:43.022 --> 24:45.272
That heard Wilder fight
with someone three days ago.

24:45.273 --> 24:46.578
It doesn't mean anything. Guys--

24:46.698 --> 24:47.572
at least I have a motive.

24:47.692 --> 24:48.542
Yeah, but can't put your
suspect at the scene

24:48.662 --> 24:49.847
Guys-- did I miss the
part where you had a ?

24:49.967 --> 24:53.847
Guys. You don't need a motive--

24:51.949 --> 24:53.155
This isn't a competition.

24:53.275 --> 24:54.779
We've got two good suspects.

24:55.351 --> 24:56.843
Seems to me that we
should bring them in

24:57.179 --> 24:58.610
and see what they say.

25:00.489 --> 25:01.993
Okay, fine.

25:02.356 --> 25:03.565
Damian and I had an argument

25:03.685 --> 25:04.896
at his apartment on Thursday night

25:05.016 --> 25:06.815
but I was not having
an affair with him,

25:06.935 --> 25:09.539
and I never went to new Jersey
to meet him in any motel.

25:09.659 --> 25:12.069
Our witness said that he
heard things being thrown,

25:12.293 --> 25:14.983
and that Wilder said something
about having a gun to his head.

25:16.175 --> 25:18.326
No, no. He was talking
about the protestors.

25:18.873 --> 25:21.776
You see, Damian was unhappy
because it was taking so long

25:21.777 --> 25:23.123
for us to find a new manufacturer.

25:23.243 --> 25:26.233
And as head production,
he felt that was on me.

25:26.531 --> 25:27.850
I didn't think it was fair,

25:27.970 --> 25:30.323
and... things got a little heated.

25:30.884 --> 25:32.674
Could you tell us where
you were Sunday night?

25:33.719 --> 25:36.044
I was out for dinner
with some friends.

25:36.318 --> 25:38.987
After dinner? Can you be
a little more specific?

25:39.379 --> 25:40.759
Yeah, I can be a lot more specific.

25:40.879 --> 25:44.048
Uh, let's say between
10:34 and 10:52.

25:44.869 --> 25:47.138
I was home... alone.

25:48.176 --> 25:51.478
Though I did step
out at some point.

25:51.479 --> 25:54.381
My neighborhood has alternate
side of the street parking,

25:54.382 --> 25:57.317
and I had to move my car,
find a different space.

25:57.318 --> 25:58.562
Did anyone see you?

25:58.682 --> 26:00.181
Not that I know of.

26:00.301 --> 26:01.649
And what time was that?

26:02.084 --> 26:04.181
Uh... 10:15 maybe?

26:04.301 --> 26:06.460
You live, what, ten blocks down Lex

26:06.461 --> 26:07.689
from where Wilder lived?

26:07.809 --> 26:09.989
At that hour, that drive
would take you two minutes.

26:11.488 --> 26:12.818
I suppose.

26:13.092 --> 26:14.746
I've never really timed it.

26:16.193 --> 26:18.031
Did you see how squirrelly she got

26:18.151 --> 26:19.436
when you asked her where
she was Sunday night?

26:19.556 --> 26:21.146
I'll have Esposito
talk to her doorman.

26:21.266 --> 26:23.421
There might be security Cam
footage that might nail down

26:23.541 --> 26:26.206
how long she was gone
from her apartment. Okay.

26:27.979 --> 26:29.123
Can I sit in?

26:29.471 --> 26:31.336
Yeah, right.

26:37.102 --> 26:39.067
I can't believe that you guys
are dragging me down here

26:39.187 --> 26:40.322
on the word of some bum,

26:40.442 --> 26:42.796
and then accusing me of
murdering my own cousin.

26:42.916 --> 26:43.772
Well, believe me.

26:43.892 --> 26:45.700
We'd like nothing more than
to be able to rule you out.

26:46.409 --> 26:48.449
So tell me again. You said
you were meeting some friends

26:48.569 --> 26:51.209
for a drink Sunday night? Yeah,
a-at McDugan's, After 11:00.

26:51.557 --> 26:53.957
That's about a block away from
your cousin's place. Yeah.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.206
And you say you were at
home until you went out

26:56.326 --> 26:57.542
to meet your friends? Yes.

26:58.325 --> 27:01.870
Are you sure about that?
Because I'm gonna talk to your doorman.

27:01.990 --> 27:04.029
I-I don't have one. Well,
I'm gonna talk to your neighbors.

27:04.149 --> 27:05.537
I'm gonna check your
credit card receipts.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.118
If you weren't home
when you say you were,

27:07.454 --> 27:08.719
I am gonna find out about it.

27:08.839 --> 27:10.708
All right, all right, fine.
I didn't go straight to the bar.

27:10.828 --> 27:13.020
I went to a newsstand.
I bought some cigarettes, all right?

27:13.311 --> 27:15.624
My friends think that I quit,
but every once in a while,

27:15.744 --> 27:17.295
I get a craving that
I can't put off.

27:17.415 --> 27:20.003
So I went to the atm,
I got some cash.

27:20.626 --> 27:22.864
I bought a pack, smoked a few,
threw the rest away.

27:22.984 --> 27:24.165
What time was that?

27:24.858 --> 27:27.284
I don't remember.
Well, your atm will.

27:27.905 --> 27:29.098
You can take a seat.

27:29.218 --> 27:30.628
Excuse us.

27:33.917 --> 27:36.615
Yeah, at a newsstand,
corner of 32nd and Lex?

27:37.859 --> 27:39.505
Yeah, yeah, go ahead. I'll hold.

27:40.972 --> 27:42.797
Ah, there she is,
leaving her building.

27:43.717 --> 27:45.947
Well, the time stamp says 10:18.

27:46.067 --> 27:47.210
Which would give her

27:47.330 --> 27:48.634
plenty of time to jump in her car

27:48.754 --> 27:50.648
and get down to
Wilder's place by 10:34.

27:50.768 --> 27:54.111
Well, we know that the killer
left the crime scene at 10:52.

27:54.231 --> 27:57.217
So the question is,
when did she get back?

27:57.337 --> 28:00.100
Yeah, got it. Thanks.

28:00.220 --> 28:02.371
So the bank confirmed
Blake's atm withdrawal.

28:02.491 --> 28:03.472
And?

28:03.592 --> 28:05.213
10:39 P.M.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.365
Right smack in the
middle of our timeline.

28:07.701 --> 28:09.252
So that means it wasn't him.

28:09.476 --> 28:12.646
Oh. Here she is coming home.
Let me just rewind a little bit.

28:12.766 --> 28:15.389
And what does the time stamp say?

28:15.509 --> 28:17.167
10:47.

28:18.037 --> 28:20.429
That's inside our timeline.
That's impossible.

28:20.691 --> 28:21.853
It wasn't her either.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.060
I was so sure.

28:25.180 --> 28:26.795
Tell me about it.

28:27.044 --> 28:29.142
You know what, guys? It's late.

28:29.262 --> 28:30.773
Why don't we just call it a night?

28:32.496 --> 28:35.281
Night.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.168
Hey there. Hi.

28:39.392 --> 28:40.420
What are you doing here?

28:40.540 --> 28:43.566
Oh, Chet had one of his
ghastly political functions.

28:43.686 --> 28:44.644
I needed my stationery.

28:44.764 --> 28:45.919
I'm writing a note to Madge

28:46.039 --> 28:47.883
to tell her how brilliant
her performance was.

28:48.003 --> 28:49.253
Oh, don't do that.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.553
Why not? Mother, she's your rival.

28:51.673 --> 28:54.824
You should be crushing her,
not giving her comfort.

28:55.956 --> 28:57.772
Are you all right?

28:57.892 --> 28:59.687
Yes.

29:02.331 --> 29:04.010
No.

29:05.539 --> 29:06.860
Give Madge my best.

29:08.004 --> 29:09.409
Uh...

29:12.943 --> 29:14.682
Oh, good. You're just in time.

29:14.802 --> 29:16.726
Looks like we caught a break
on our Scarlett O'Hara.

29:16.846 --> 29:18.968
You found her?
Found the next best thing--

29:19.088 --> 29:20.829
the clerk who checked
her in to the motel.

29:20.949 --> 29:22.768
Police picked him
up in Atlantic City

29:22.888 --> 29:25.238
for charges of disorderly conduct.

29:26.701 --> 29:28.235
Morning, sunshine.

29:30.212 --> 29:32.276
Why'd you leave town
in such a hurry, Benny?

29:32.558 --> 29:33.839
I was feeling lucky.

29:33.959 --> 29:36.066
Wanted to get to the craps
table fast as I could.

29:36.186 --> 29:37.555
Did you have a good
time down there, Benny?

29:37.829 --> 29:39.499
Dude.

29:39.619 --> 29:41.923
I appreciate you guys
<i>intervejecting</i>

29:42.043 --> 29:43.563
with the police down
there on my behest.

29:43.683 --> 29:46.079
Well, we wanted to talk with you.
Well, I'm happy to help.

29:46.199 --> 29:48.841
One favor, though.
Could you not talk so loud?

29:49.226 --> 29:50.803
My head is killing me.

29:53.005 --> 29:54.882
Last Thursday, you were on duty

29:55.002 --> 29:57.433
when a Scarlett O'Hara checked in.

29:58.570 --> 30:00.447
Yeah. Yeah, I think I remember.

30:00.851 --> 30:02.430
What did she look like?

30:02.977 --> 30:04.407
I woulda done her.

30:04.527 --> 30:05.827
Anything else?

30:06.436 --> 30:09.271
Um... she was small for her size.

30:09.994 --> 30:11.574
Do you recognize this man?

30:11.996 --> 30:15.111
Yeah. That guy's a total nut bar.

30:15.459 --> 30:18.285
Last week--think it was Thursday,
matter of fact--

30:18.646 --> 30:21.040
he pulls into the motel
in a fancy foreign job.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.728
He goes straight up

30:22.848 --> 30:24.133
to the corner room
on the second floor.

30:24.253 --> 30:26.636
Couple minutes later,
he charges down,

30:26.897 --> 30:29.480
starts asking me all the same
questions you were asking me.

30:29.754 --> 30:32.247
Who rented the room,
what did she look like?

30:32.913 --> 30:34.145
He didn't know?

30:34.265 --> 30:35.554
That's what I said.

30:35.674 --> 30:39.018
I told him, if he had to ask
<i>me</i> whose room it was,

30:39.304 --> 30:41.057
he shouldn't be going in
there in the first place.

30:41.492 --> 30:44.485
He stomped off, got in his car.
He left. Boom!

30:44.771 --> 30:46.006
Never saw him again.

30:46.126 --> 30:48.790
And you won't either.
He was murdered Sunday night.

30:50.419 --> 30:52.676
With that kinda attitude,
this is not surprising.

30:53.558 --> 30:55.005
Well, if I've answered

30:55.125 --> 30:57.108
all your queries to your satisfaction,
am I free to go?

30:57.228 --> 30:58.868
Just one more query
if you don't mind.

30:58.988 --> 31:01.383
According to the Atlantic city police,
you were arrested

31:01.503 --> 31:03.481
in the diamond lounge
of a strip club

31:03.601 --> 31:05.962
for trying to set a
rodeo clown on fire.

31:06.082 --> 31:07.492
That was a misunderstanding and--

31:07.612 --> 31:08.748
my question is,

31:08.868 --> 31:10.557
how does a $9-an-hour hotel clerk

31:10.677 --> 31:13.567
pay for a $500-an-hour V.
I.P. Lounge?

31:13.687 --> 31:14.956
I won at craps.

31:15.205 --> 31:17.287
Like I said, I was feeling lucky.

31:17.673 --> 31:19.381
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.601
That's a Damian Wilder bag.

31:21.986 --> 31:23.006
Who?

31:23.126 --> 31:24.624
That's the guy who was killed.
Where'd you get that?

31:24.744 --> 31:26.386
Um... where'd you get it, Benny?

31:26.506 --> 31:27.877
Um, please, just not so loud.

31:27.997 --> 31:28.944
Where'd you get it?

31:29.064 --> 31:31.922
I found it in the room.
Scarlett O'Hara's room?

31:32.270 --> 31:34.156
After checkout on the fourth day,

31:34.276 --> 31:36.570
I went up there on account of,
she never returned the key.

31:36.831 --> 31:38.963
The room was like
nobody'd even been there.

31:39.083 --> 31:41.071
The bed was made,
towels were on the rack.

31:41.307 --> 31:42.801
I gave it a quick once-over,

31:42.921 --> 31:45.288
figured I'd tell housekeeping
not to bother going in.

31:46.079 --> 31:47.509
I found the bag under the bed.

31:47.832 --> 31:49.668
And what was in it?

31:49.905 --> 31:51.454
What was in it?

31:51.574 --> 31:55.074
Aah! There was money... lots of it.

31:55.194 --> 31:57.370
How much?

31:57.931 --> 31:59.349
75 grand.

31:59.469 --> 32:00.795
There.

32:00.915 --> 32:03.128
Did you blow it all, Benny?

32:03.595 --> 32:05.522
It was the best three
days of my life.

32:06.343 --> 32:07.772
A duffel bag full of cash

32:07.892 --> 32:10.414
an anonymous hotel room
and an angry Wilder--

32:10.534 --> 32:12.428
all of that adds up
to only one thing.

32:12.652 --> 32:13.827
Blackmail.

32:13.947 --> 32:15.291
It's the only scenario
that makes sense.

32:15.411 --> 32:18.567
So the blackmailer contacts
Wilder with instructions

32:18.687 --> 32:20.498
to meet at the motel
at a certain time.

32:20.618 --> 32:23.371
Probably to show him proof of
whatever it is she has against him.

32:23.491 --> 32:25.187
But she doesn't want
him to know who she is

32:25.307 --> 32:26.699
or that she works at his company.

32:26.819 --> 32:29.408
So she calls in to the room,
makes her demands by phone.

32:29.528 --> 32:32.330
He confronts the clerk, trying to figure
out who it is that's extorting him.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.556
At some point in time,

32:33.676 --> 32:35.551
Wilder returns to the room with
the duffel bag full of cash,

32:35.671 --> 32:36.905
puts it under the
bed as instructed.

32:37.025 --> 32:38.504
Only Benny makes off with the money

32:38.624 --> 32:40.369
before the blackmailer's
had a chance to pick it up.

32:40.489 --> 32:42.212
Making for one angry blackmailer.

32:42.332 --> 32:44.979
Angry enough to kill.

32:51.193 --> 32:53.419
No, not her either.
Man, this dead guy had

32:53.539 --> 32:55.082
a lot of good-looking
babes working for him.

32:55.202 --> 32:57.599
Any of them our Scarlett O'Hara?
Uh, not her...

32:57.719 --> 33:00.050
Or her, but I'd do her.

33:01.006 --> 33:03.716
Not her, who I would not do.

33:03.836 --> 33:05.745
Not her.

33:05.865 --> 33:07.219
I would maybe do her.

33:07.339 --> 33:10.539
Hey, look. It's her.

33:11.145 --> 33:12.886
You're sure this is the woman
who rented the room?Yes.

33:13.006 --> 33:14.080
Yes.

33:14.739 --> 33:17.698
Rebecca Strong. She's a
lab tech at the company.

33:18.879 --> 33:21.043
Oh, she's got cruel eyes.

33:21.446 --> 33:23.299
I'll bet she enjoyed
watching Wilder suffer.

33:23.419 --> 33:27.877
(Crying and speaking indistinctly
(Crying and speaking indistinctly

33:29.183 --> 33:30.153
What did she say?

33:30.273 --> 33:32.205
"What was I thinking?
I should've stayed out of it."

33:32.466 --> 33:34.854
It's cry talk. There's not a
girl alive who hasn'heard it

33:34.974 --> 33:36.598
from a sobbing,
heartbroken girlfriend.

33:36.822 --> 33:39.874
What should you have stayed out of,
Rebecca, the blackmail?

33:43.278 --> 33:45.452
You tried to do the right thing?

33:45.572 --> 33:48.141
Well, who wouldn't listen?
Did you have an accomplice?

33:48.403 --> 33:50.063
Was just me.

33:50.299 --> 33:51.630
Well, then what is this all about?

33:51.750 --> 33:54.486
Benzophyosopheme.

33:55.628 --> 33:57.133
I'm sorry. I didn't get that one.

33:57.719 --> 33:59.385
Benzophyosopheme.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.829
That's not cry talk.
It sounds like a chemical compound.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.937
You work in product testing, right?

34:04.817 --> 34:07.237
Were they using benzophyosopheme
in a company product?

34:08.359 --> 34:09.984
Is there some kind
of problem with it?

34:10.103 --> 34:11.337
Is that what the
blackmail was about?

34:11.804 --> 34:12.962
So then when you said

34:13.081 --> 34:14.324
that you were trying
to do the right thing,

34:14.444 --> 34:15.751
did you approach your
superiors about the problem?

34:15.871 --> 34:16.634
Yes.

34:16.754 --> 34:18.906
And did Wilder do
anything about it? No.

34:19.025 --> 34:20.092
He came out with a product

34:20.213 --> 34:21.721
that has benzophyosopheme
in it anyway.

34:21.841 --> 34:23.199
Exactly.

34:23.447 --> 34:24.790
Well, how bad is this stuff?

34:24.909 --> 34:28.474
It can cause capillary damage
if you use it long enough.

34:28.594 --> 34:31.080
So then you figured,
if they weren't gonna listen to you,

34:31.199 --> 34:32.572
why not cash in on it?

34:32.692 --> 34:34.817
And then you threatened
to make it public

34:34.937 --> 34:37.791
if Wilder didn't give you $75,000.

34:37.911 --> 34:39.370
Yes.

34:39.489 --> 34:41.157
Well, you were in over
your head, Rebecca.

34:41.277 --> 34:44.009
I know, and I want to make
things right if I can.

34:44.129 --> 34:46.609
It's too late for that now.
I--what if I gave it back?

34:46.728 --> 34:48.547
You killed a man.
I still have the money.

34:48.667 --> 34:50.413
You still have the money?
I killed a man?

34:50.533 --> 34:53.420
Damian Wilder.
I didn't kill Mr. Wilder.

34:53.540 --> 34:54.716
You have the money?.

34:54.982 --> 34:57.494
It's still in the duffel bag
that I got from under the bed.

34:57.614 --> 34:59.766
Wait. The money
from the motel room?

34:59.886 --> 35:02.223
$75,000.

35:02.343 --> 35:05.231
Well, then the money
that Benny found...

35:05.351 --> 35:06.682
Where did it come from?

35:06.802 --> 35:09.177
$75,000.

35:09.935 --> 35:12.019
It was in her hall closet
just like she said it'd be.

35:12.292 --> 35:14.386
Two blackmail payoffs?
I don't get it.

35:14.672 --> 35:16.577
Rebecca must have missed
the second duffel bag

35:16.697 --> 35:17.925
under the bed when she
went to pick up the money.

35:18.045 --> 35:20.112
Which is why Benny found it
when he went back there later.

35:20.232 --> 35:22.302
Yeah, but we looked through
Wilder's financials

35:22.422 --> 35:24.373
with a fine-tooth comb.
There was nothing in there

35:24.493 --> 35:26.304
to suggest that he
pulled that kind of cash.

35:26.528 --> 35:28.580
It's hard to imagine he
had it just lying around.

35:28.928 --> 35:31.048
What would happen if Wilder
didn't pay the blackmailer?

35:31.168 --> 35:32.329
Well, that would mean

35:32.449 --> 35:33.895
letting the capillary
damage issue go public.

35:34.015 --> 35:35.126
What if he didn't care?

35:35.549 --> 35:36.971
What if he wanted to
do the right thing

35:37.431 --> 35:38.751
and pull the product,
even if it meant

35:38.871 --> 35:40.834
a huge financial hit and
possible litigation?

35:41.220 --> 35:43.543
Then anyone with a financial
stake in the company

35:43.663 --> 35:45.576
would have incentive to
keep that from happening.

35:45.696 --> 35:47.806
And the surest way to do
that would be to kill Wilder

35:48.055 --> 35:49.524
and pay off the blackmailer.

35:49.644 --> 35:52.087
So the cousin would have
company stock worth a fortune

35:52.207 --> 35:53.729
from when he lent Wilder
the start-up money.

35:53.849 --> 35:55.112
Yeah, but we know he didn't do it.

35:55.232 --> 35:56.848
And then Lisa Jenkins
could be looking

35:56.968 --> 35:58.486
at criminal liability
if it got out that

35:58.606 --> 36:00.087
she let a dangerous
product go to market.

36:00.207 --> 36:01.599
Yeah, but we know she
didn't do it either.

36:01.822 --> 36:03.113
Well, something doesn't
make sense here.

36:03.233 --> 36:04.418
Castle.

36:04.538 --> 36:05.897
Hey.

36:06.017 --> 36:07.508
Mnh-mnh. Come here.

36:09.485 --> 36:11.711
Hey. Uh, what's wrong, guys?

36:14.999 --> 36:17.212
Benzophyosopheme.

36:18.107 --> 36:20.140
Oh, no. Not the shave cream.

36:20.260 --> 36:22.197
Yeah, in the shave cream.
It says here right on the can.

36:22.317 --> 36:24.785
Ah. That's how they get
it to come out hot.

36:25.020 --> 36:27.093
Might as well just be
shaving with napalm, bro.

36:27.983 --> 36:29.661
Well, she said it only
does damage long term.

36:29.781 --> 36:31.233
You guys have only
used it the one time.

36:31.805 --> 36:33.142
I'm still on my first can.

36:33.262 --> 36:35.852
Coulda ended up with
irreversible capillary damage.

36:36.784 --> 36:38.065
I was...

36:38.488 --> 36:39.952
The timeline's wrong.

36:40.072 --> 36:42.243
Exactly. There wasn't
time to do any damage.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.871
No, for the murder.
What are you talking about?

36:45.876 --> 36:46.784
What is she talking about?

36:46.904 --> 36:48.663
I don't know where you going?

36:48.783 --> 36:51.174
Wilder's apartment.
I know who did it.

36:51.633 --> 36:52.988
I know who killed him.

36:53.108 --> 36:55.539
Who? Who?

37:03.734 --> 37:05.985
I just shot Damian
Wilder in the chest,

37:07.354 --> 37:08.772
and he's bleeding out.

37:09.257 --> 37:10.478
It's dark.

37:11.666 --> 37:13.966
But I still manage to
sop up some of the blood

37:15.086 --> 37:16.616
and I head over here

37:17.685 --> 37:19.315
to start writing the message,

37:19.435 --> 37:20.892
implicating the protestors.

37:21.012 --> 37:23.071
But it takes longer
than I thought it would

37:23.191 --> 37:26.453
because I keep having to go
back in order to get more blood.

37:26.864 --> 37:28.978
And then all of a sudden,
I hear a noise out the back.

37:29.464 --> 37:31.404
So I stop and I think to myself,

37:32.760 --> 37:34.364
you know what? I better
get the hell outta here.

37:34.625 --> 37:36.452
Hold on. You're forgetting
about the bludgeoning part.

37:36.776 --> 37:40.984
I walk out the front door
and I let it lock behind me.

37:41.104 --> 37:43.015
I race across the street,
I hail a cab,

37:43.135 --> 37:44.937
and it's about 10:40.

37:45.198 --> 37:46.944
Yeah, but now you're forgetting
about the stolen books.

37:47.064 --> 37:48.361
The noise outside.

37:48.598 --> 37:50.048
You're thinking there
was someone else.

37:50.168 --> 37:51.457
Someone who had no idea

37:51.577 --> 37:53.209
that Wilder had already been shot.

37:53.925 --> 37:55.716
Someone who came
in through the back

37:55.836 --> 37:56.994
into the bedroom,

37:57.114 --> 37:58.751
and in the dark,
found a heavy object

37:58.871 --> 38:00.878
and bludgeoned him in his bed.

38:00.998 --> 38:02.068
Two killers.

38:02.188 --> 38:04.770
So it's the second killer
who steals the books.

38:04.890 --> 38:06.699
And then getting those books

38:06.819 --> 38:08.199
out of this display case

38:08.319 --> 38:09.633
takes a few minutes,

38:10.267 --> 38:12.383
after which, it's out the door,

38:13.009 --> 38:14.314
and it's 10:52.

38:14.434 --> 38:16.748
Giving the first killer more
than enough time to get home,

38:16.868 --> 38:19.591
where she can be seen by,
let's say, a security camera

38:19.711 --> 38:20.841
And the second killer

38:20.961 --> 38:23.514
wouldn't appear to be
involved if he was, say,

38:23.634 --> 38:26.245
buying cigarettes when
the gunshot went off.

38:26.365 --> 38:29.668
Lisa and Blake came here
separately to kill Wilder,

38:29.788 --> 38:30.699
and by doing that,

38:30.819 --> 38:33.141
they both inadvertently
alibied each other out.

38:33.261 --> 38:34.726
They both knew it was
their only chance

38:34.846 --> 38:36.339
to stop Wilder before
he stepped forward.

38:36.952 --> 38:38.544
The press conference he'd called.

38:39.372 --> 38:40.938
It was not about animal rights.

38:41.058 --> 38:42.808
He was about to announce
a product recall.

38:42.928 --> 38:45.515
And they each decided they
couldn't let that happen.

38:45.635 --> 38:48.634
They both killed him,
and they both paid the blackmailer.

38:48.754 --> 38:51.148
Which means they both had
to raise a lot of money

38:51.268 --> 38:53.241
in not a lot of time.

38:56.095 --> 38:57.961
We found withdrawals
from bank accounts,

38:58.081 --> 39:00.609
money market funds, even 401S,

39:00.729 --> 39:03.996
all of it totaling $75,
000 from each one of them.

39:04.232 --> 39:05.777
They didn't cover their tracks
because they didn't think

39:05.897 --> 39:07.696
anyone would get on to the
blackmail and come looking.

39:07.816 --> 39:10.250
It turns out Blake was leveraged
in debt up to his eyeballs.

39:10.799 --> 39:12.577
If the company stock
had taken a hit,

39:12.697 --> 39:14.526
the whole House of
cards would've fallen.

39:14.646 --> 39:15.391
And her?

39:15.511 --> 39:16.730
She didn't want to serve time.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.671
She's the one who sat
on initial reports

39:18.791 --> 39:20.159
that there were problems
with the shaving cream.

39:20.279 --> 39:21.317
Poor Wilder.

39:21.437 --> 39:23.596
Tried to do the right thing and
gets himself killed. Mm-hmm.

39:24.067 --> 39:26.641
Castle and Demming were right
about the two of them all along.

39:26.915 --> 39:28.083
Nice of you to give them both

39:28.203 --> 39:29.723
the satisfaction of
taking down their suspect.

39:29.843 --> 39:31.660
Oh, well, it's the
least I can do...

39:32.160 --> 39:34.262
Male vanity being what it is.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.263
Hey. Hey.

39:49.717 --> 39:51.756
So listen, thanks...

39:52.415 --> 39:53.436
Thanks for your help on this one.

39:53.556 --> 39:56.175
Oh, you know, same team.

40:00.338 --> 40:02.365
Guess I'll see you around.

40:03.036 --> 40:04.703
Yeah.

40:13.592 --> 40:15.010
One murder, two killers.

40:15.130 --> 40:16.467
That's something you
don't see every day.

40:16.587 --> 40:18.875
Yeah. That's definitely another
one for the record books.

40:18.995 --> 40:21.370
You guys seen Beckett?
I wanted to congratulate her.

40:21.490 --> 40:22.745
She's the one who
cracked this one open.

40:23.118 --> 40:25.098
I think she's in the back
processing the charges.

40:25.218 --> 40:26.616
Thanks.

40:28.659 --> 40:29.596
Make all day.
