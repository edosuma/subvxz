WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:05.802
Mom, I love that you're proud of me,
but I'm not a doctor yet.

00:05.839 --> 00:09.206
You can't keep giving my number out
to women in your church group

00:09.242 --> 00:11.369
and saying I'll help them. I can't.

00:11.444 --> 00:14.277
Oh, hey, tell your mom
the cookies she made are ridic.

00:14.314 --> 00:16.544
Yes, that's him.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.914
It means "ridiculous."

00:19.252 --> 00:21.982
No, there's no reason to shorten
that word.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.047
Look, I gotta go. Bye.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.215
Your mom doesn't like me
very much, does she?

00:26.259 --> 00:28.159
No, she's crazy about you.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.958
See, you're lying.
You're chewing on your hair.

00:30.997 --> 00:34.194
Babe, I can read you
like the back of a DVD case.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.061
You chew on your hair when you lie,

00:36.102 --> 00:38.263
you adjust your bra
when you're gonna yell at me

00:38.304 --> 00:40.966
and you get a far-off look in your eyes
when you narrate in your head.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.269
Even though Cole and I
were clicking...

00:42.308 --> 00:46.267
- There it is!
- Stop noticing things I do!

00:46.312 --> 00:48.712
Even though Cole and I were
clicking, there was another couple

00:48.748 --> 00:51.546
that was even more in sync
than we were.

00:51.584 --> 00:54.747
Queer. Hey, before you go study,
I need your help.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.551
I have a patient who had to pee
on a ski lift,

00:56.589 --> 00:59.080
so she pulled her pants down
and her butt froze to the seat.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.525
And when she got off,
she lost most of the skin on her ass.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.358
- What's the question?
- Can I laugh at that?

01:03.430 --> 01:05.455
- That depends. Is she within earshot?
- No.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.433
It's funny. No butt skin.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.366
- I lied. She's right behind you.
- What?

01:13.940 --> 01:15.168
Ouch.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.272
Well, chapter 14 is down.

01:17.310 --> 01:20.211
Only 400 more pages to go
before the test tomorrow.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.578
I've never had to work this hard
in my life.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.082
School's always been easy for me.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.143
Not to brag, but I was my high school
and college valedictorian.

01:27.187 --> 01:28.245
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

01:28.288 --> 01:30.756
I was on the cover of Time magazine
as a 9-year-old

01:30.790 --> 01:32.849
because I invented a new kind of laser.

01:32.892 --> 01:34.883
Trang, you are so smart.

01:35.328 --> 01:37.660
Babe, you're smothering me.

01:37.697 --> 01:40.029
You can be a big fish at home,
then you get to med school

01:40.066 --> 01:41.192
and everybody's brilliant.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.225
Man, you brainiacs think
you have it tough?

01:43.269 --> 01:44.566
My 'rents made me go to med school

01:44.604 --> 01:47.004
because everyone on my dad's side
is a doctor.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.905
Okay, on my mom's side,
everyone is a bounty hunter.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.807
I don't know
why I couldn't go to school for that.

01:50.844 --> 01:54.712
Everyone in my entire family
is counting on me to become a doctor.

01:55.148 --> 01:56.911
And just in case I forget that fact,

01:56.950 --> 02:00.078
my mom calls me every eight minutes
to check in.

02:00.153 --> 02:01.211
I feel the pressure, too.

02:01.254 --> 02:04.621
Not so much from my parents,
mostly because they think I'm dead.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.420
All right. Moving on.
The nervous system.

02:12.365 --> 02:15.596
Bar codes?
What the hell is this, a supermarket?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.398
That's a human being, for God's sake.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.770
Listen, old prospector, I know
that any new machine scares you,

02:20.807 --> 02:22.274
but here's the well-held secret.

02:22.308 --> 02:26.210
You know that box that records
your favorite television shows?

02:26.679 --> 02:28.874
There isn't a demon inside of it.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.906
Then how does it know what I like?

02:30.950 --> 02:33.043
I miss the good old days

02:33.086 --> 02:36.146
when doctors and patients
actually got to know each other.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.851
You know,
back when sexually harassing a nurse

02:38.892 --> 02:41.190
was just considered polite chitchat.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.956
Yes. The good old days.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.362
Back when a man of my color
couldn't be a doctor,

02:45.398 --> 02:47.263
but could live out his lifelong dream

02:47.300 --> 02:50.997
of one day driving a white woman
to her hair appointments.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.896
Yes, things were much better
back then.

02:53.940 --> 02:56.374
See? Turkleton gets it.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.013
Happy test day. You know,
I'll be there, so don't mess it up.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.880
- Crap, I'm already late.
- Wait. Breakfast.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.179
Strawberry frosting? Nice.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.211
Yeah, you got fruit, dairy,
enough sugar for a month.

03:09.255 --> 03:10.813
- What else do you need?
- Spoon.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.848
Use your fingers, Queen Elizabeth.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.352
Mmm!

03:14.727 --> 03:17.093
Delicious. I'll see you later. I love you.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.358
Um...

03:21.401 --> 03:24.529
- What was that?
- That just sort of slipped out.

03:24.737 --> 03:27.900
I'm gonna just assume
that was the frosting talking

03:27.941 --> 03:30.933
'cause you know that's something
I don't ever want to hear.

03:30.977 --> 03:33.707
- So, would you like to take that back?
- Yes, please.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.222 --> 03:44.690
Hello, again. Yeah, you know what?

03:44.958 --> 03:47.791
I don't want to take it back.
'Cause it's the truth.

03:47.827 --> 03:51.160
Since the second I met you, you've
made everything in my life better.

03:51.197 --> 03:56.157
So, ha, yeah, I love you.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.874
Perry, I thought we agreed
you wouldn't page me during lunch

04:03.910 --> 04:05.969
and I wouldn't make you
do cool hip-hop handshakes.

04:06.012 --> 04:08.310
Fine. Then I owe you a fist bump
and a peace out.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.043
But in the meantime,
I need a surgical consult

04:10.083 --> 04:11.812
on a patient with ulcerative colitis.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.341
She is a lesbian.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.685
Hey, babe, you ever thought about
being with another chick?

04:17.857 --> 04:20.017
No, Cole. Ew!

04:22.662 --> 04:26.496
I only tell you this so that
I can remain relatively guilt-free

04:26.532 --> 04:29.763
for when you do inevitably stick
one of your size 13 caveman feet

04:29.802 --> 04:32.202
- firmly into your own mouth.
- I can handle a lesbian.

04:32.238 --> 04:36.732
I'm a professional doctor.
Give me what you owe me. Yeah, yeah.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.402
Yeah!

04:39.445 --> 04:41.640
All right, then. Books down, murderers.

04:41.681 --> 04:45.378
It is time to show off
your useless regurgitation skills.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.113
Dr. Mahoney will be your proctor.

04:47.153 --> 04:50.418
There you go. Try not to tell the test
that you're in love with it.

04:55.728 --> 04:58.288
Sorry, dawg.
Already called shotgun on the lesbian.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.060
You can't call shotgun on a person.

05:00.099 --> 05:04.263
- All right, then. Dibs.
- Damn it. Dibs works.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.205
Todd, I'll let you run point on this,
but you gotta be cool.

05:08.241 --> 05:11.802
Hi, I'm Dr. Lesbian, I'll be your lesbian.

05:12.412 --> 05:14.471
I got it from here, Todd.

05:15.214 --> 05:18.115
- I said I've got it from here, Todd.
- Okay.

05:20.386 --> 05:23.878
All right, then, gutter scum.
I just found this cheat sheet.

05:23.956 --> 05:27.221
Any of you who left this room
during the test, stays.

05:27.293 --> 05:30.091
The rest of you, get out! Out!

05:32.632 --> 05:35.396
Now, I gotta tell you
that I feel pretty confident

05:35.435 --> 05:38.233
that I can maintain
a certain level of calm

05:38.271 --> 05:41.832
if the owner of this
would simply admit to it.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.432
Anyone?

05:44.744 --> 05:46.678
Go ahead and get that.

05:47.146 --> 05:51.674
Hi, Mom. No, the test isn't over,
so I don't know my grade yet.

05:51.718 --> 05:54.278
I'm so sorry,
it's really hard to get her off the phone.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.345
I get that. My mom's the same way.

05:56.389 --> 05:57.549
Let me see this.

05:59.425 --> 06:00.858
That works.

06:14.707 --> 06:18.939
I found this cheat sheet in the unisex
bathroom just outside this hall.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.503
So, either we have
a Matt Damon-type custodian

06:21.547 --> 06:23.947
with an extensive knowledge
of the central nervous system,

06:23.983 --> 06:25.382
or one of you cheated.

06:25.418 --> 06:30.617
And since just last week I saw one
of our fine janitors eat a piece of chalk,

06:30.656 --> 06:31.816
I'm guessing the latter.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.026
Here's the deal. You're all going to be
locked in this room

06:35.061 --> 06:38.792
until one of you
comes forward and takes responsibility.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.461
I hope you all think long and hard
about what you've done.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.504
No, no, no, no, no.
Butch, this happened on your watch.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.506
- You're not going anywhere.
- Would it make any difference

06:47.540 --> 06:49.007
if I told you I have a personal issue

06:49.041 --> 06:51.601
that makes staying in here
really horrible for me?

06:51.644 --> 06:53.805
It would make me quite a bit happier.

06:53.846 --> 06:54.870
Ha.

06:56.649 --> 06:59.618
- Beth, this is Dr. Turk.
- How are you doing?

06:59.786 --> 07:02.084
She must be your lady friend, huh?
Your lover.

07:03.656 --> 07:04.816
I don't even know why I whispered that.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.655
I just don't know what you guys
call each other nowadays. What is it?

07:07.860 --> 07:10.021
Are you uncomfortable
around lesbians?

07:10.129 --> 07:13.121
What? Me? No.

07:16.969 --> 07:20.496
Nicole, I'm gonna run a series of tests
on you, but it would help me out a lot

07:20.540 --> 07:22.667
if you could tell me what type
of stomach pain you were having.

07:22.708 --> 07:24.573
It's not that bad, really.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.238
The truth is
Beth wanted me to get checked out.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.977
We're going on vacation next week
to lbiza with a bunch of our girlfriends.

07:31.017 --> 07:37.889
And all we do is dance,
drink and, uh, swim.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.494
Are you okay, Dr. Turk?

07:43.629 --> 07:47.861
Yeah, I'm fine. I was just thinking
about my family vacation to Ohio.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.595
Yeah, we, uh...

07:51.337 --> 07:54.306
We visited two science centers
and it was a lot of fun.

07:54.340 --> 07:55.705
My daughter got scared, though,

07:55.741 --> 07:57.936
so we had to spend most of the time
in the car.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.270
It was pretty awesome.

08:00.813 --> 08:04.613
Twenty-eight, 29, 30.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.244
Damn, Trang,
you are impervious to pain.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.548
Pay up, bitch.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.783
Dr. Cox has to let us out eventually.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.554
I mean, he can't keep us here forever.
Can he?

08:20.233 --> 08:22.030
What's your secret?

08:22.335 --> 08:25.736
Shea butter and big, floppy sun hats.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.239
Oh, and I made a deal with a witch.

08:29.408 --> 08:33.003
How come witches never offer me
a deal? I'm approachable.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.710
Drew, come on, just admit you cheated.
It's okay.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.908
You didn't have time to study.
You were out in a meadow,

08:38.951 --> 08:41.078
pressing wildflowers
and writing love sonnets.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.283
Yes. Me telling you I love you
makes me a 19th-century dandy.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.786
Hey, Maya, you and Trang both left
during the test. Where were you?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.852
Guys, we all left at some point.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.422
She's right.
We have to stop turning on each other,

08:53.466 --> 08:55.593
especially since it's so obvious
that Cole is the one who cheated.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.602
I'm sure Cole
has some great explanation.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.230
Cole, what were you
doing in the bathroom?

09:00.273 --> 09:02.036
Doing my test prep, okay?

09:02.074 --> 09:04.235
Part one. Dropping a D.

09:04.343 --> 09:07.972
Part two. Using the mnemonics skills
I picked up at ADD camp.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.040
Okay, I remember the circulatory
system by singing Nickelback.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.329
Wow, that makes
a kind of horrible sense.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.359
How'd that go for you?
Awkward or really awkward?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.234
- Neither. Super awkward.
- Oh!

09:31.304 --> 09:34.296
Look, Nicole's colitis is pretty
advanced and surgery is too risky

09:34.340 --> 09:36.570
due to her diabetes
and thrombocytopenia.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.008
We'll just treat her with steroids, then.

09:38.044 --> 09:40.342
She must be in a lot of pain.
I wonder why she didn't tell me.

09:40.379 --> 09:44.076
Maybe she did, but you didn't hear her
because you were fantasizing

09:44.116 --> 09:46.380
about being stranded
on Lesbian Island.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.684
Is that a real place?
Because I can leave tonight.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.723
- What?
- We're just hard-staring you away.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.083
Oh.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.098
There's only one way
to prove your innocence.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.793
It's a human lie detector test.

10:01.834 --> 10:04.564
I take your pulse
and I ask you some basic questions.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.129
You can't tell if I'm lying.
I play online poker.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.970
- You ever kissed a dude?
- No.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.771
- Lie.
- It was a lacrosse initiation.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.278
- I didn't even want to do it.
- My God, your pulse is racing.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.371
Hey, forget this, man. What about you?

10:15.414 --> 10:18.440
I hope it was Drew and I hope
he gets his butt thrown out of here.

10:18.484 --> 10:22.011
What did he do to you?
Did he smack you around?

10:22.054 --> 10:25.182
Worse. He told me he loved me.
Who does that?

10:25.224 --> 10:27.192
Don't you see?
He's trying to get me to trust him

10:27.226 --> 10:28.523
so then he can just let me down.

10:28.561 --> 10:31.962
Crazy idea.
You could just say "I love you" back.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.091
Yeah, but then if it doesn't work out,
I'll have to kill him,

10:34.133 --> 10:37.261
go to jail, escape, come back
and kill you for giving me that advice.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.739
I love how our friendship is based
predominantly on threats,

10:40.773 --> 10:42.832
but as much as they do terrify me,

10:42.875 --> 10:47.175
I'm gonna go ahead and say it.
You and Drew are awesome together.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.545
Quit being such a chicken
and just go for it.

10:51.517 --> 10:53.485
Hey, you never told us
why you were in the bathroom.

10:53.519 --> 10:54.986
In the bathroom taking a leak.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.955
Didn't you stop using public toilets

10:56.989 --> 11:00.083
after you lived in a gas station
bathroom for a month?

11:00.159 --> 11:03.890
That's right.
It was your fun fact at orientation.

11:03.929 --> 11:05.920
Maya's fact was she's color-blind,

11:05.965 --> 11:08.365
and Trang absorbed his twin sister
in the womb.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.892
That's why he's so smart.
My boy's got two brains.

11:10.936 --> 11:14.099
- That's not how it works, genius.
- Why are you lying, Drew?

11:14.140 --> 11:17.268
- What are you covering up?
- I was on the phone, all right?

11:17.443 --> 11:19.536
You made a phone call
in the middle of a test?

11:19.578 --> 11:21.102
- To who?
- It doesn't matter.

11:21.213 --> 11:22.237
Um...

11:22.715 --> 11:27.846
I can still feel you staring at me
like a cheetah stares at a gazelle.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.610
I'm thinking.

11:31.557 --> 11:34.720
Fine. What the hell,
I'll tell the jackass I love him.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.456
It was a personal call
and it's nobody's business.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.327
It is our business,
'cause you weren't on the phone.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.025
- You were cheating.
- I wasn't cheating.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.730
I can prove it. I was on the phone
with my divorce lawyer.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.463
- You're married?
- A little.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.297
You always put yourself at risk

11:49.341 --> 11:51.866
when you decide to
trust someone else...

11:51.911 --> 11:53.879
Listen, I can explain.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.646
The good news is that we can manage
your colitis with steroids.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.016
There are some side effects, however,

12:01.053 --> 12:03.283
including fatigue, insomnia
and weight gain.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.051
Isn't there an operation I can have?

12:05.091 --> 12:09.551
Yes, there is, but with your preexisting
conditions, surgery could prove fatal.

12:09.662 --> 12:12.426
...whether you're trusting
a patient to respond a certain way...

12:12.465 --> 12:14.433
I don't care, I want the surgery.

12:16.168 --> 12:20.298
...or counting on your peers
to let an awkward moment go by.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.566
Hey. How come
you never introduced us to your wife?

12:24.610 --> 12:27.579
Oh! I get it. Her face is busted, right?

12:27.747 --> 12:29.578
I'm sick of this crap.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.641
Now, we all know I didn't cheat,
so it's gotta be one of you.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.381
Maya? Trang? Lucy?

12:35.488 --> 12:36.819
It wasn't me.

12:36.856 --> 12:39.791
But the hardest thing is when
people put their trust in you

12:39.825 --> 12:43.420
and you're the one
who's been lying all along.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.466
- How'd that hair taste?
- Like regret,

12:50.503 --> 12:52.664
and coconut
because of my new conditioner.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.536
But mostly like regret.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.405
I never should have cheated.
What am I gonna do?

12:58.511 --> 13:01.776
Hi, boys and girls.
Anybody admit to anything yet?

13:03.182 --> 13:06.117
Here's what I'm going to do.
If someone doesn't tell me who did it,

13:06.152 --> 13:08.086
I'm gonna make you all retake the test.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.883
It's gonna be a new test,
gonna be 10 times as hard.

13:09.922 --> 13:14.416
It's not just gonna be on medicine.
It's going to be on everything.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.088
Baseball statistics,
North Dakota high schools,

13:17.129 --> 13:20.758
the geography of a made-up
fantasy world I like to call Coxatopia.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.031
That's a magic land
where the rivers run of scotch

13:24.069 --> 13:27.197
and hordes of pigs feed on the bones
of cheating med students.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.730
Where's Mahoney and Drew?

13:30.576 --> 13:33.340
Okay, yes, I have a wife.
Let's start there.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.108
It was a drunken mistake.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.478
I've been trying to get out of it
ever since.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.608
What else haven't you told me?
I mean, have any kids?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.913
Have you robbed a bank?
Were you in a cult?

13:39.952 --> 13:43.581
No! No, and I wouldn't call it a cult.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.317
It was more like a marketing opportunity

13:45.357 --> 13:46.824
that ended with us all living
on a compound.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.692
What the hell? Both of you
get your asses back in that room.

13:49.728 --> 13:50.854
No.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.764
I'm gonna go ahead
and give you a pass

13:52.798 --> 13:56.256
because you have murder eyes.
But, you, (WHISTLING) go.

13:59.872 --> 14:02.534
I just think choosing surgery
could kill you.

14:02.575 --> 14:06.238
Talk to your lady sidekick.
What's the word I'm looking for?

14:06.278 --> 14:08.246
I don't want Beth knowing
anything about this.

14:08.280 --> 14:12.341
I want the surgery and there's nothing
you can say that'll change my mind.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.419
Please, tell me you've got some good
news for me on this godforsaken day.

14:18.457 --> 14:21.187
She's still refusing steroids.
I don't get it. What are we missing?

14:21.227 --> 14:23.821
As usual, you are missing the point.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.125
She walked in off the street

14:25.164 --> 14:28.224
and you didn't take the time to find out
anything about her.

14:28.267 --> 14:32.533
She could be anybody. A princess
or a terrorist or a hot lesbian.

14:32.571 --> 14:34.766
Bob, she is a hot lesbian.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.537
I knew one day
that example would make sense.

14:37.576 --> 14:38.634
And we did talk to her.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.669
About her condition,
but not about what makes her tick.

14:41.714 --> 14:45.980
You see, in the old days, when we knew
everything about a patient,

14:46.018 --> 14:48.612
their decisions never surprised you.

14:48.821 --> 14:52.587
You find out more about that
young lady, I bet you'll find the answer.

14:54.159 --> 14:57.287
If only there was a way
to learn more about her.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.354
To the Internet!

15:01.734 --> 15:03.531
I'm not like your girlfriend, Dorian.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.264
I don't roll like that.

15:05.304 --> 15:08.068
All right. I'm just trying
to make it through the day.

15:08.107 --> 15:09.665
As you please.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.178
This is Denise.
Leave a message after the stupid beep.

15:14.213 --> 15:18.013
Denise, it's Drew. Look, if you're not
into me anymore, that's fine,

15:18.050 --> 15:21.918
because there are a lot of women
who get hot for married guys.

15:22.288 --> 15:23.448
Ha, ha, ha.

15:24.123 --> 15:29.026
Too soon? Probably.
Look, I'm a jerk. And I'm a mess.

15:29.061 --> 15:31.461
And please call me back.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.260
I can't take this anymore.
I have to turn myself in.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.565
Oh, babe, babe,
you don't have to do that.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.468
I do. It's not right.

15:40.205 --> 15:41.797
Hey, guys.

15:42.174 --> 15:45.109
I'm really sorry I didn't say this
hours ago, but the truth is...

15:45.144 --> 15:49.513
I cheated. All right? I told Lucy earlier
and she's been protecting me.

15:50.182 --> 15:51.945
Boom. Twist.

15:52.051 --> 15:53.279
Wow!

15:53.319 --> 15:57.688
The cheating cheater
who everybody thought cheated

15:57.723 --> 16:01.022
is the one who cheated.
You're right, sweet twist.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.629
Dr. Cox, check this out.

16:04.663 --> 16:08.099
- My God. Is that Nicole?
- Yes.

16:09.501 --> 16:10.900
Is this why you don't want
to take steroids?

16:10.936 --> 16:12.904
Because you're worried about
how much weight you're gonna gain?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.098
That was eight years ago.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.403
Beth has never known me like this
and I don't want her to.

16:16.442 --> 16:20.538
We're talking about your health here.
Beth is going to understand.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.170
Before you make any decisions,

16:22.214 --> 16:24.910
do yourself a favor
and talk it over with your partner.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.418
Partner. Thank you. Partner.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.580
That's the word
I was looking for. "Partner."

16:29.621 --> 16:32.385
You guys are lesbian partners together.

16:32.958 --> 16:35.859
I'm gonna just back out,
but think about it.

16:37.863 --> 16:41.526
- Cole, what are you doing?
- Baby, I'm untouchable at this school.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.432
I'll take the fall for you.

16:43.769 --> 16:47.967
And because this is so noble,
I'm gonna walk out in dramatic slo-mo.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.806
You can't let him do this.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.976
Just tell them.
I am the one who cheated.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.815
No, out loud. Tell them out loud.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.252
It was me.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.191
I was the one who cheated.

17:07.792 --> 17:12.252
Are you sure? Because we're
all signed off on Cole taking the blame.

17:12.297 --> 17:15.164
Yes, I did it. I hate myself for it.

17:15.200 --> 17:18.636
I'm so sorry.
It's just that I am drowning here.

17:19.371 --> 17:22.965
Ever since I got to med school,
everything's been a struggle.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.599
I wanted a win.

17:25.010 --> 17:29.447
Something that I could tell my mom
about without being full of crap.

17:29.481 --> 17:33.144
I'm really sorry, truly,
for putting you all through this

17:35.054 --> 17:37.784
and I'll go tell Dr. Cox that I cheated.

17:45.631 --> 17:46.928
Come on, what would Carla say

17:46.965 --> 17:48.865
if she found out that you'd already
been married once before?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.665
Yo, whoa, whoa!
Don't even joke like that.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.795
If that gets back to Carla,
I'm a dead man.

17:53.839 --> 17:56.239
Talking about me being married
before Carla.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.709
Dr. Turk, you were married before?

17:58.744 --> 18:00.336
We're talking here.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.273
That's one of Carla's girlfriends.

18:02.314 --> 18:05.613
I can't have that. This is just as bad
as if I were to call Carla bitchy.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.141
You think Carla's bitchy?

18:07.186 --> 18:08.949
No, I didn't say...

18:08.987 --> 18:13.185
Sheila, just take your butt
to where it needs to be and stay there!

18:13.725 --> 18:15.784
I just feel like
I finally found someone I can trust

18:15.828 --> 18:19.320
and then he goes and does this.
I mean, what am I supposed to do now?

18:19.665 --> 18:21.132
Look at those two right there.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.601
I hear you. Everyone thinks
I'm a little butch anyway.

18:23.635 --> 18:25.500
I mean, I might as well dive in.

18:25.537 --> 18:30.201
No. Denise, no.
Nicole is one of my patients.

18:30.242 --> 18:33.439
And she was willing to risk death
to keep her past from her partner.

18:33.479 --> 18:35.174
I just learned that word,
by the way. "Partner."

18:35.214 --> 18:36.806
- I'm proud of you.
- Sometimes when you really care

18:36.849 --> 18:41.479
about someone, you want them
to know you just as you are right now,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.750
the best version of yourself.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.053
Are you really going to blame Drew
for that?

18:47.092 --> 18:49.993
Hey. Guys, have you seen Dr. Cox?

18:50.028 --> 18:51.586
He went back to the lecture hall,

18:51.630 --> 18:55.031
mumbling something
about feeding med students to pigs.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.295
Great.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.730
Deep breath. I can do this.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.641
Please, tell me exactly what part
of "don't leave this room" is lost on you.

19:07.679 --> 19:10.045
- Look, Dr. Cox...
- Go sit down.

19:10.582 --> 19:14.484
Now, since you all claim that you have
no idea who the cheater is,

19:14.520 --> 19:17.751
the re-exam will be tomorrow morning
at 4:00 a.m.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.890
Outside. Rain or shine.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.793
Although, if I were you, I'd plan for rain
because I'm gonna bring a hose.

19:30.536 --> 19:33.869
What the Fraggle Rock just happened?
You guys didn't turn me in?

19:34.706 --> 19:37.038
No, truth is I'm drowning here, too.

19:37.075 --> 19:40.044
And the only reason I'm surviving
is because of you.

19:40.312 --> 19:44.146
I mean, this place is straight-up
Chuck Norris. Tough as balls.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.242
We're all having trouble.

19:46.285 --> 19:47.479
Even you, Drew?

19:47.519 --> 19:52.422
No, but I've had, like,
15 second chances in my life.

19:52.858 --> 19:57.659
You deserve at least one, right?
Just don't do it again.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.362
They say
the truth will set you free,

20:00.399 --> 20:02.765
but sometimes you need a little push.

20:02.801 --> 20:05.235
She's gonna go with the steroids.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.062
Should we tell Kelso he was right?

20:07.105 --> 20:08.538
I'll just send him an e-mail.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.542
I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know
how to turn his computer on.

20:10.576 --> 20:11.634
Mmm.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.802
Telling the truth's
just the beginning.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.437
Owning it's the hard part.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.881
Hey, Mom. School's great.

20:21.853 --> 20:28.816
Actually, it's a lot harder than I thought
and I'm having a really tough time.

20:29.761 --> 20:34.095
Because the one thing you can
never run from is how you really feel.

20:34.466 --> 20:35.694
- Hey.
- Don't talk.

20:35.734 --> 20:36.962
I have something to say.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.061
And after I say it,
I don't want you to say anything back

20:39.137 --> 20:42.834
and I don't want you to look at me
and I don't want it acknowledged at all.

20:46.211 --> 20:47.610
I love you.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.514
Now, don't talk to me
for a couple of days.

20:57.155 --> 21:00.181
Carla, calm down, okay?
I don't care what Sheila said.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.523
I was never married
and I didn't call you bitchy.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.462
I know she's a good friend of yours,
but that woman is crazy, baby.

21:05.497 --> 21:08.523
She's crazy. No, I... What do you...

21:08.567 --> 21:10.034
But that...

21:12.904 --> 21:18.570
Don't you hang up on me! Don't...
Damn, my wife is annoying.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.076
What do you say? 20 bucks a head
to keep your mouths shut?

21:24.116 --> 21:26.710
All right, follow me to the ATM.
Come on.
