00:20.047 --> 00:22.387
It's so unfair I got in trouble today.

00:22.412 --> 00:23.832
So unfair.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.218
Right? I mean, there
I was, grooving my way

00:26.243 --> 00:27.784
into probably the most
revolutionary sound

00:27.808 --> 00:29.218
the world has ever heard,

00:29.243 --> 00:31.687
and Mr. Frond calls it
a "major disturbance"?

00:33.953 --> 00:36.101
Gene Belcher, dear God in heaven.

00:36.126 --> 00:37.546
But you were going for annoying, right?

00:37.555 --> 00:39.015
No. It's a special sound.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.255
With a special purpose, I assume.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.660
Alarm clock companies are
always looking for new sounds.

00:43.685 --> 00:46.147
Come on, let's go to the bar.

00:46.172 --> 00:48.290
I want to knock back a
couple before going home.

00:48.594 --> 00:51.290
That takes the edge off.

00:51.420 --> 00:52.800
Oysters.

00:52.825 --> 00:54.085
I miss the dumpling house days.

00:54.115 --> 00:55.825
Yeah, and the taco truck days.

00:55.905 --> 00:57.535
Nah, I'm over those places.

00:57.655 --> 00:59.319
Dollar oysters are my new tacos.

00:59.344 --> 01:01.374
One more Kumamoto, please, Charles.

01:01.399 --> 01:03.140
- You got it, Gene.
- Ew.

01:03.165 --> 01:05.075
Look at that green blob. No judgment.

01:05.099 --> 01:08.230
Looks like if whale diarrhea
and Gene's diarrhea had a baby.

01:08.255 --> 01:10.175
- Aw.
- It might be ugly, but that right there

01:10.215 --> 01:12.772
is the most important
stuff in the entire ocean.

01:12.797 --> 01:13.820
It's plankton.

01:13.845 --> 01:15.585
- Plankton, you say?
- Yeah.

01:15.610 --> 01:18.110
It's the food small critters
eat, like these oysters.

01:18.135 --> 01:21.280
Then the small critters get
eaten by big critters and so on,

01:21.305 --> 01:23.395
all the way up to Godzilla.

01:23.435 --> 01:25.895
You hear that? You sure you
guys don't want to try one?

01:25.920 --> 01:28.870
It's full of plankton and tastes
like delicious post-nasal drip.

01:28.895 --> 01:30.395
Mm...

01:34.825 --> 01:37.535
Can you believe I got banned
from making an amazing sound

01:37.560 --> 01:39.955
very much like this at school?

01:40.035 --> 01:42.455
You could also stop
making that sound here.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.350
Yeah, Gene, I love your sounds,
but this one is killing me.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.495
It's a little annoying.

01:47.585 --> 01:49.125
Annoying?

01:49.215 --> 01:51.175
Yeah, this is the album
where your fans go,

01:51.215 --> 01:52.715
"Ooh, what happened?"

01:52.740 --> 01:55.070
And then you go to rehab
and your comeback is amazing.

01:55.095 --> 01:56.965
Okay, you know what?

01:57.095 --> 02:00.179
That's about all the negativity
a boy can take in one day.

02:00.204 --> 02:03.895
- Aw, where you going, sweetie?
- I need some fresh air.

02:03.975 --> 02:06.105
Huh. But Gene hates fresh air.

02:06.225 --> 02:09.685
Tina, Louise, you better go with him.
It's getting dark out.

02:09.775 --> 02:11.895
But you said these menus
won't wipe themselves.

02:11.945 --> 02:14.775
- So they will wipe themselves.
- Just go.

02:14.865 --> 02:16.655
Annoying?

02:16.735 --> 02:18.565
Just wait. When I'm dead, my sounds

02:18.590 --> 02:21.300
are gonna be in the Top 40
and you guys are gonna say,

02:21.325 --> 02:24.196
"Gene was doing that years ago."

02:25.205 --> 02:27.540
What the... ? That's weird.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.020
Are you seeing this?

02:32.045 --> 02:34.175
Yeah. Let me try.

02:34.200 --> 02:37.125
- Whoa...
- Damn.

02:39.385 --> 02:43.345
And underwater aliens will be
snatching us in three, two...

02:43.435 --> 02:45.435
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

02:45.555 --> 02:46.915
Well, that is just...

02:46.940 --> 02:49.040
You are gorgeous, whatever you are.

02:49.065 --> 02:51.370
I... I love you, magic water?

02:52.000 --> 02:53.895
- Nice bags!
- What?

02:53.985 --> 02:55.671
Let me guess, you bought
stuff for your burgers?

02:55.695 --> 02:57.315
Uh, yeah.

02:57.365 --> 02:59.350
- That's what I thought.
- Wait, sorry, Trev.

02:59.375 --> 03:00.840
Was that supposed to be an insult?

03:00.970 --> 03:02.680
- Zoom?
- I guess it was.

03:02.705 --> 03:04.665
Jimmy put me in charge
while he's out of town.

03:04.705 --> 03:06.695
He's in Key Largo. Then Montego.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.430
He's trying to hit every
place in the song "Kokomo."

03:09.455 --> 03:11.429
- Uh-huh.
- It's weird not having Jimmy around.

03:11.454 --> 03:13.475
Okay, Trev, uh. I need to go inside now.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.865
These bags are starting to get heavy.
And, uh, I want to.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.940
- Trev is acting weird.
- He misses Jimmy. He told me.

03:19.965 --> 03:21.385
Aw, I feel bad for him.

03:21.425 --> 03:22.885
I don't. Or I guess I do.

03:22.975 --> 03:25.649
But I feel bad for a lot
of other people before him.

03:25.674 --> 03:27.831
- Where are the kids?
- They're at the oyster bar.

03:27.855 --> 03:28.566
Again?

03:28.591 --> 03:30.700
Yeah, they saw glowing lights
in the ocean last night.

03:30.725 --> 03:32.081
They want to find out if they saw God

03:32.105 --> 03:33.435
or if it's something radioactive.

03:33.485 --> 03:35.195
So they're gonna poke at it some more.

03:35.275 --> 03:38.243
Beautiful blue thingy? Where are you?

03:38.268 --> 03:40.146
Here's the Glencrest
order. What you doing, Gene?

03:40.195 --> 03:43.445
You haven't seen a majestic
blue creature around, have you?

03:43.470 --> 03:45.485
Blue creature? What kind
of blue we talking about?

03:45.510 --> 03:48.010
It's like if you dropped the
Blue Man Group in a blender.

03:48.035 --> 03:51.186
There was this amazing blue
glowing thing right there,

03:51.210 --> 03:53.769
but now there's just
that ugly plankton blob.

03:53.795 --> 03:55.804
Oh yeah, that. It's the same blob.

03:55.829 --> 03:58.788
-Say what?
-Well, sometimes plankton glow at night.

03:58.813 --> 04:00.295
It's called bioluminescent.

04:00.385 --> 04:02.585
So it's gross during the day,
but fun and frisky at night?

04:02.610 --> 04:04.320
- Like leather pants?
- Yeah.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.975
Sometimes they glow, sometimes
they move around a little bit.

04:07.015 --> 04:08.701
They're very sensitive
to all sorts of stuff.

04:08.725 --> 04:11.913
Light, sound, movement,
arguments, personal slights.

04:11.938 --> 04:14.065
For some it's an eyesore,

04:14.090 --> 04:15.770
but they're not seeing
what's really there.

04:15.895 --> 04:18.065
So you're just an annoying blob, huh?

04:18.195 --> 04:19.522
You and me both, pal.

04:19.547 --> 04:20.671
We got to kill that plankton?

04:20.695 --> 04:22.275
- Uh-huh.
- Wait, what?

04:22.365 --> 04:24.225
Boss said if that
plankton doesn't go away

04:24.250 --> 04:25.880
before the regatta, we got to bleach it.

04:25.905 --> 04:28.155
Ha, you said "regatta, we gotta."

04:28.180 --> 04:30.191
Did I say
"regatta, we gotta"?

04:30.216 --> 04:31.244
You did, you did.

04:31.375 --> 04:35.005
No! They're gonna kill my blob buddy!

04:35.030 --> 04:37.360
Hah. "Regatta, we gotta."

04:40.385 --> 04:43.425
Aw, my little Gene
Cousteau, look so handsome.

04:43.505 --> 04:45.389
Thank you, Mother.
And thank you, Father,

04:45.414 --> 04:47.055
for loaning me your ascot.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.250
That is a dish rag, but
it looks good on you.

04:49.395 --> 04:51.757
So you really think you can
just talk these yacht club people

04:51.782 --> 04:53.910
out of killing an ugly plankton blob?

04:53.935 --> 04:55.565
First of all, don't call it ugly.

04:55.605 --> 04:57.540
It's just saving it
all for the nighttime.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.695
And yes, yes, I do.

04:58.870 --> 05:00.540
Okay. How, exactly?

05:00.565 --> 05:02.961
I'll reason with them. They eat
oysters, oysters eat plankton,

05:02.985 --> 05:05.985
bing, bang, boom, they decide
not to kill the plankton blob.

05:06.010 --> 05:08.335
Then we smoke cigars,
then binge-watch Billions.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.800
Well, I see zero holes in this plan.

05:09.825 --> 05:12.775
-Thank you.
-Louise, Tina, go with your brother.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.470
What? Why do we have
to keep Gene-sitting

05:14.495 --> 05:16.245
this Gene-tastrophe?

05:16.270 --> 05:18.060
Yeah, we have a life. Oh, wait.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.960
He's already feeling a little
poopy about everyone pooping

05:20.985 --> 05:23.650
on his sounds and now he's
feeling bad about this blob.

05:23.675 --> 05:25.715
- Come on, be nice.
- Kids, go or clean.

05:25.740 --> 05:28.625
- Oh! Okay, yeah, see you later.
- We're going, we're going.

05:33.407 --> 05:36.047
Hello, hi. Can I help you kids?

05:36.072 --> 05:39.325
I'd like to speak with
Mr. Crest. Mr. Glen Crest.

05:39.350 --> 05:42.750
Glencrest is the name of
our club, not an individual.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.645
My brother is here to speak
with the club president

05:44.670 --> 05:46.840
about a pressing matter.

05:46.865 --> 05:50.491
Our president is too busy with
regatta preparations to talk to kids.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.905
- So...
- And we're gonna

05:51.930 --> 05:54.060
- breeze right past you now.
- What? Wait. No.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.310
- Thank you.
- Oh... Oh, fine.

05:56.335 --> 05:58.195
Hey, Mr. Important Man Sir, got a sec?

05:58.220 --> 06:00.140
Um, not really. Who are you?

06:00.165 --> 06:02.545
We're here to save the
plankton blob in your marina.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.360
I overheard your henchmen
talking about bleaching it.

06:05.385 --> 06:06.885
You overheard that, did you?

06:06.965 --> 06:09.274
Well, it is one of the
options we're exploring.

06:09.299 --> 06:12.445
But you can't! From one oyster
lover to another, be reasonable.

06:12.470 --> 06:13.910
That's the stuff that feeds the stuff

06:13.935 --> 06:15.395
that feeds our pretty faces.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.155
But that annoying blob
isn't supposed to be

06:17.185 --> 06:18.925
in our private marina.

06:18.950 --> 06:21.290
The wind blew it in, and
it's not blowing it out.

06:21.315 --> 06:22.685
You're being a blob-snob.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.490
And a bit of an algae-hole.

06:24.515 --> 06:26.095
Not to mention a, um, um...

06:26.120 --> 06:27.670
Uh, come back to me.

06:27.695 --> 06:30.155
Don't make me go to
Channel Six News with this.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.735
Olsen Benner would rip
this story wide open,

06:32.760 --> 06:35.510
like she did with that
day-old muffin exposé.

06:35.535 --> 06:38.335
I see. Well, here's something
you might not have known:

06:38.415 --> 06:40.455
that blob is most likely full of toxins

06:40.545 --> 06:43.455
- that can kill shellfish.
- Wait, what?

06:43.480 --> 06:46.480
Kids, that's a bad blob. Bad blob!

06:46.505 --> 06:48.465
Bad plankton? Is that possible?

06:48.490 --> 06:50.570
How about this? Just to be certain,

06:50.595 --> 06:53.329
I'll order, uh, a study of the plankton.

06:53.353 --> 06:54.094
Really?

06:54.119 --> 06:56.329
Of course. We don't want
to bleach healthy plankton.

06:56.435 --> 06:58.935
No one cares more about
ocean life than yacht clubs.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.710
Our boats literally float on the ocean.

07:01.735 --> 07:03.235
- Good point.
- Is it, though?

07:03.315 --> 07:04.961
Look, I've got to tend
to other matters now,

07:04.985 --> 07:07.685
but you kids feel free
to sample our buffet.

07:07.710 --> 07:10.124
The raw bar is your oyster.

07:10.149 --> 07:12.880
Thanks. See, I told you
they'd be reasonable here.

07:12.905 --> 07:15.495
Oh, ooh, wow.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.560
Al, get these kids whatever they want.

07:17.630 --> 07:20.180
- I want to not be near oysters.
- I'll take, uh,

07:20.205 --> 07:22.773
three fingers of your
most expensive ginger ale.

07:22.798 --> 07:24.718
And that tub of cherries, straight-up.

07:26.961 --> 07:28.070
Hi, Trev.

07:28.095 --> 07:29.965
I bet if Jimmy was here,
he'd make fun of you

07:29.990 --> 07:31.570
for not having any customers.

07:31.595 --> 07:32.925
Uh, that seems about right.

07:33.055 --> 07:34.725
Yeah. Jimmy's the best.

07:34.765 --> 07:36.095
Mm-hmm. Maybe not the best.

07:36.225 --> 07:37.581
Sometimes I kind of wish Jimmy and I

07:37.605 --> 07:39.195
wouldn't pick on you so much.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.935
Really? Okay. You-you could stop.

07:41.065 --> 07:43.475
Ha! "Stop." Good one. Up top.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.460
We-we don't have
to high-five.

07:45.485 --> 07:47.929
It's just, I haven't
high-fived Jimmy in a while.

07:47.954 --> 07:50.090
He texted me and we
swapped high five emojis,

07:50.115 --> 07:52.365
but it's not the same. See?

07:52.390 --> 07:53.760
He texted "Bob's dumb."

07:53.785 --> 07:56.655
Oh, wow. So, you guys make
fun of me in your free time?

07:56.680 --> 07:57.970
Mostly just Jimmy.

07:57.995 --> 07:59.575
You know what, Trev? You actually seem

07:59.600 --> 08:01.310
like sort of a niceish guy.

08:01.335 --> 08:03.625
You shouldn't let Jimmy turn
you into a meanie weenie.

08:03.705 --> 08:04.915
I'm not a meanie weenie.

08:05.005 --> 08:07.465
Well, you act like one
when you're with Jimmy.

08:07.505 --> 08:09.065
You act like one when you're with Jimmy.

08:09.135 --> 08:10.835
It's just high-fiving. Geesh.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.820
I'm not gonna leave a guy hanging.

08:12.845 --> 08:14.095
That's not how I was raised.

08:14.175 --> 08:15.885
I hope Jimmy comes back soon.

08:15.980 --> 08:17.570
And we breeze right past you...

08:17.595 --> 08:20.055
- Wait, I... Oh, oh... Fine.
- Mm-hmm.

08:20.105 --> 08:22.185
Hey, there, Mr. President Man Sir.

08:22.265 --> 08:23.755
So did you get the results back?

08:23.780 --> 08:25.410
- Uh, the what?
- The plankton study?

08:25.435 --> 08:27.815
Ah, yes, uh, the plankton study.

08:27.855 --> 08:31.025
Oh, shoot, it is a bad blob.

08:31.115 --> 08:33.615
- Really? Oh, no.
- Sorry, Gene.

08:33.710 --> 08:36.235
- Can we see the report?
- Uh, yeah, sure. There it is.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.054
Uh... Oh. Wait. Uh, oh...

08:37.078 --> 08:38.301
No... Nope, that...
no, that's all you need.

08:38.325 --> 08:38.871
Oh... Uh...

08:38.897 --> 08:40.510
No, no, no, no.
It's all science mumbo jumbo,

08:40.534 --> 08:42.525
but, uh... look, over there.

08:42.549 --> 08:44.600
That's the oceanographer.
He did the study.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.625
I'll have him dumb it down for you.

08:47.274 --> 08:50.205
Uh, we tested the
plankton and it has, uh,

08:50.230 --> 08:51.770
high levels of bad stuff in it.

08:51.795 --> 08:54.495
Bad stuff like what? Bullets? Knives?

08:54.520 --> 08:57.530
Well, I'm sure you're a
very busy oceanographer,

08:57.555 --> 09:00.725
- so off you go.
- To do oceanography somewhere else.

09:00.765 --> 09:03.015
- Oh, cool. Where?
- Uh, the ocean.

09:03.105 --> 09:05.525
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- So that's it?

09:05.565 --> 09:07.581
- You're gonna bleach it?
- But if you bleach the marina,

09:07.605 --> 09:09.041
won't that kill everything in the water,

09:09.065 --> 09:10.485
not just the plankton?

09:10.565 --> 09:13.445
No, no, no, it's actually
a very Eco-friendly process.

09:13.485 --> 09:16.010
Just before the regatta, we'll
sprinkle some bleach powder.

09:16.035 --> 09:19.785
It gets an A+ rating from the
Ocean's Eleven, uh, Institute

09:19.865 --> 09:21.325
- of Oceans.
- Mm-hmm.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.141
- Bye. Goodbye. Goodbye, now.
- Oh, wait, uh...

09:23.165 --> 09:25.195
- Turn around, walk away. There you go.
- Okay.

09:25.220 --> 09:28.600
All right, kids. Wonderful to see you.

09:29.047 --> 09:32.610
Hey, so, I guess you aren't
such a good blob after all.

09:32.635 --> 09:35.585
That's cool. That oceanographer
is bringing champagne to...

09:35.610 --> 09:37.900
his oceanography friends?

09:37.925 --> 09:40.530
Yeah, he is not an
oceanographer. He's a waiter.

09:40.555 --> 09:42.499
But he knew all the terminology.

09:42.524 --> 09:43.990
They tricked us.

09:44.015 --> 09:46.685
- They're gonna bleach a good blob.
- Bastards.

09:46.725 --> 09:48.871
I'm going back in there to
ask them to borrow their phone

09:48.895 --> 09:50.525
to call Channel Six News.

09:50.605 --> 09:52.565
You could do that, or we can beat them

09:52.590 --> 09:54.840
- at their own game.
- How do we do that?

09:54.865 --> 09:57.325
Well, right now, they don't
know you know they tricked you.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.050
- So?
- So use it.

09:59.075 --> 10:01.525
Let them think they won so
they keep their guard down

10:01.550 --> 10:03.800
- for what we're gonna do.
- What are we gonna do?

10:03.825 --> 10:06.221
Well, I've got an idea. We're
gonna need someone with a boat,

10:06.245 --> 10:08.085
knowledge of yacht clubs and who'd love

10:08.110 --> 10:10.575
to take Glencrest down
in tomorrow's regatta.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.060
Oh, you asked for us to step outside?

10:13.085 --> 10:15.468
Duncan, why do we even live on an island

10:15.493 --> 10:17.280
if just anyone can come here?

10:17.305 --> 10:19.696
- For the views?
- Shush.

10:21.891 --> 10:24.315
Sasha, Duncan, we have a proposition...

10:24.340 --> 10:26.155
you guys help us stop
Glencrest from killing

10:26.225 --> 10:27.935
the plankton blob in their marina...

10:27.960 --> 10:29.250
And what do we get?

10:29.275 --> 10:31.635
Satisfaction of knowing
you did the right thing?

10:31.660 --> 10:34.421
I love doing the right thing.
It's the best! Right, Sasha?

10:34.446 --> 10:36.155
Yeah, me too... Ooh.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.881
- Ankles...
- So, no socks, huh?

10:37.905 --> 10:40.054
No, I'm wearing my boaties.

10:40.079 --> 10:41.630
You don't wear your
sockies with your boaties.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.265
- Ankles away.
- Come again?

10:44.290 --> 10:46.035
- Anky Doodle Damn, D.
- Sorry?

10:46.085 --> 10:48.093
- Little something for the ank bank.
- I'm not following.

10:48.118 --> 10:50.680
- Oh, you mean my leg knobs?
- I sure do.

10:50.705 --> 10:52.391
I don't know what you
two are talking about,

10:52.415 --> 10:54.085
but as far as your
little plankton plan goes,

10:54.110 --> 10:55.860
that's a hard no.

10:55.885 --> 10:58.295
But it's partly your people's
fault this is happening.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.820
Uh, sorry, how's that?

10:59.845 --> 11:02.375
Glencrest only wants to
bleach the plankton blob

11:02.400 --> 11:04.570
so that it's gone in time
for the stupid regatta

11:04.595 --> 11:07.345
- against your stupid yacht club.
- But if the plankton blob

11:07.370 --> 11:09.290
is still there for the
start of the regatta...

11:09.315 --> 11:12.500
That blob will make Glencrest
look like total slobs.

11:12.525 --> 11:14.235
So what's the plan?

11:14.260 --> 11:16.460
Some Hench-people are
gonna sprinkle bleach powder

11:16.485 --> 11:18.115
onto the blob tomorrow morning.

11:18.140 --> 11:20.340
But we want them to think
they sprinkled bleach,

11:20.365 --> 11:22.285
so we need to replace
their bleach powder

11:22.310 --> 11:23.786
with something else,
something that won't hurt

11:23.811 --> 11:26.651
- the ocean, like baking powder or...
- Panko.

11:26.676 --> 11:28.096
- Panko?
- Bread crumbs.

11:28.121 --> 11:29.795
Bread crumbs, of course.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.570
Bread crumbs make everything better.

11:31.595 --> 11:33.031
We probably have that at the restaurant,

11:33.056 --> 11:35.016
but it's not nearly enough.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.227
We have, like, a ton of panko
in the kitchen right here.

11:37.252 --> 11:38.672
- Why?
- Oh, I don't know,

11:38.697 --> 11:40.321
maybe because a yacht club goes through

11:40.345 --> 11:42.005
a Jacuzzi's worth of
fried shrimp every day.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.450
How do we get the panko?

11:43.475 --> 11:45.375
I'm a member of a yacht club, young man.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.320
When I ask for panko,
they ask, "How panked?"

11:47.345 --> 11:49.015
So we have a deal? We save the blob,

11:49.040 --> 11:51.410
you get to embarrass
Glencrest, everyone's happy.

11:51.435 --> 11:53.565
-Deal.
-Duncan, let's shake ankles on it.

11:53.590 --> 11:55.297
Well, I, I would like to
respect your country's customs.

11:55.891 --> 11:58.696
I suppose I'm up for it.

11:59.985 --> 12:03.050
Hey, guys. Sorry I
freaked out yesterday.

12:03.075 --> 12:05.575
Well, I'm sorry I called
you a meanie weenie.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.470
Yeah, guess I wasn't ready to admit

12:07.495 --> 12:09.035
the only bond I have with Jimmy

12:09.060 --> 12:12.140
- is making hilarious fun of Bob.
- It's not hilarious.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.245
But I don't want to be a
meanie weenie like you said.

12:14.270 --> 12:15.940
I want to be a nicey weenie.

12:15.965 --> 12:17.811
-So what are you gonna do about it?
-I don't know.

12:17.835 --> 12:20.635
Well, you can't stop
Jimmy from insulting Bob,

12:20.660 --> 12:22.530
but you can stop high-fiving him.

12:22.555 --> 12:24.530
Aw, that's the best part.

12:24.555 --> 12:26.225
Plus, like I told you, it's impossible.

12:26.305 --> 12:27.602
Come on, we'll role-play.

12:27.627 --> 12:29.740
- I'll be Jimmy and I'll insult Bob.
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.855 --> 12:32.405
Hey, I'm Bob, I cry at
the end of every movie.

12:32.430 --> 12:34.330
- Up top.
- Cries.

12:34.355 --> 12:36.895
- Not every movie.
- No, don't high-five.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.000
Oh, right. But it's hard not to.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.865
- It's like a... a reflex.
- It's okay.

12:40.985 --> 12:42.655
- Let's try again.
- Oh, my God.

12:42.735 --> 12:45.615
I'm Bob, I was born with
armpit stains. Uh, zoom.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.690
Uh-uh.

12:47.715 --> 12:49.445
W-What are we doing? What is this?

12:49.470 --> 12:51.220
We're role-playing.
I'm pretending to be

12:51.245 --> 12:53.875
Jimmy Pesto making fun of Bob
so Trev stops high-fiving him.

12:53.995 --> 12:56.205
- Can I play?
- I-It's not really a game, it's just...

12:56.255 --> 12:59.495
I'm Bob, I look like a
dog from the '70s. Up top.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.980
Dog!

13:01.005 --> 13:02.295
- No.
- D'aw.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.900
I'm Bob, my barber can't decide

13:04.925 --> 13:06.741
where my neck hair ends
and my back hair begins.

13:06.765 --> 13:08.135
No high five.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.725
- Aw, I can't. I just can't.
- Hmm.

13:09.805 --> 13:11.645
I'm Bob. I'm scared of long hugs.

13:11.670 --> 13:14.145
I don't want to hug you.
That's not scared of long hugs.

13:14.225 --> 13:16.435
I'm Bob and I have a
birth mark near my peehole

13:16.460 --> 13:18.178
that makes it look like
I have a double peehole.

13:18.203 --> 13:19.257
Lin.

13:19.282 --> 13:20.775
Double peehole.

13:20.815 --> 13:22.315
Yay, you didn't high-five.

13:22.340 --> 13:23.630
Breakthrough.

13:23.655 --> 13:25.075
Wow, I did it.

13:25.115 --> 13:26.535
- Isn't it great, Bob?
- Yup.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.829
Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. This
has been really great.

13:30.946 --> 13:34.260
Ahoy. Can I get a little
help with the tie-off, please?

13:34.285 --> 13:35.995
Uh, we're kind of busy right now.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.060
Great, thanks, my family just joined.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.770
I'm sure you got the
club-wide bulletin?

13:39.795 --> 13:41.465
- Are they buying it?
- Yeah.

13:41.505 --> 13:43.611
I just have to yacht-splain a
few things and we'll be good.

13:43.635 --> 13:45.675
Uh, no one told us anything, so...

13:45.700 --> 13:48.400
Oh, it's so okay, these things
happen, it's not your fault.

13:48.425 --> 13:50.015
I can tell you guys are great.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.015
My dad's boat is called the Cha-Ching,

13:52.095 --> 13:54.355
as you can tell, but
new yacht club, new name.

13:54.395 --> 13:56.725
I assume you guys have
decals ready for the rename?

13:56.815 --> 13:58.525
- Decals?
- Again, not your fault.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.315
Let's just take a
walk to the decal shed.

14:00.395 --> 14:02.905
Come, come, come, come,
come. So, name-wise,

14:03.025 --> 14:04.775
I'm thinking Boaty Boaty Bo-Boaty,

14:04.865 --> 14:07.025
Banana Fana Flo-Floaty
Me My Mo-Moaty,

14:07.115 --> 14:08.865
unless another member
already has that name.

14:08.945 --> 14:10.785
Tina, there must have
been a rat below deck

14:10.865 --> 14:12.425
'cause something was tickling my ankles.

14:12.495 --> 14:14.430
Uh, yep, that's rats for you.

14:14.455 --> 14:15.785
Um, did it feel good?

14:15.875 --> 14:17.545
- Well, it felt weird.
- Weird good?

14:17.625 --> 14:19.545
- Creepy weird.
- Creepy weird good?

14:19.570 --> 14:21.810
- Creepy weird bad?
- Creepy weird bad good?

14:21.835 --> 14:23.295
Sorry, bread crumbs.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.860
You're being sacrificed
so that blob may live.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.820
We're walking back to my boat now

14:27.845 --> 14:30.015
since we couldn't find the decal shed.

14:30.095 --> 14:32.435
Which is embarrassing for you guys.

14:32.460 --> 14:35.120
Wait a second, does that
say Glencrest Yacht Club?

14:35.145 --> 14:36.605
Oh, my goodness. This is crazy.

14:36.725 --> 14:39.435
I'm a new member at
Crestglen Yacht Club.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.460
I'm sure this happens all the time.

14:41.485 --> 14:43.471
Stay in touch, okay, bye.

14:51.205 --> 14:53.715
Shoo, you dumb birds.
Don't eat the bleach.

14:53.740 --> 14:56.035
Jeepers, the gullies are
having a crack at the crumbies.

14:56.165 --> 14:57.625
Hey, wait a second.

14:57.705 --> 14:59.545
This isn't bleach. It's bread crumbs.

14:59.585 --> 15:02.086
- Stop that boat.
- Go, go, go!

15:02.111 --> 15:04.350
What the... Hey!

15:04.375 --> 15:06.635
Can't this thing go any faster?

15:06.715 --> 15:08.452
You can't make wake in a marina.
We're not animals.

15:09.228 --> 15:11.055
Um, you might want to make that wake.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.580
That jerk can't stop us.

15:12.605 --> 15:13.975
Catch it, catch it.

15:15.757 --> 15:18.932
- Oh, crap, that jerk stopped us.
- Yacht blocker!

15:21.025 --> 15:24.275
So, you switched the powdered
bleach with bread crumbs.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.380
Well played, but not well played enough.

15:26.405 --> 15:28.405
You lied about the plankton study.

15:28.430 --> 15:30.970
That was no oceanographer,
he was a fantastic waiter.

15:30.995 --> 15:32.510
I don't need an oceanographer to tell me

15:32.535 --> 15:35.665
that ugly blob needs to go.
Just look at it.

15:35.745 --> 15:38.205
- Yuck!
- Aah! Stop calling it ugly.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.350
It's a majestic
life-giving plankton blob

15:40.375 --> 15:42.035
and it's damn sexy at night.

15:42.060 --> 15:44.020
We'll be taking our bleach
back now. Hand it over.

15:44.045 --> 15:45.465
- No. No.
- Give me the bleach.

15:45.505 --> 15:46.830
- Hand the bleach...
- No, no, no, no, no,

15:46.855 --> 15:47.643
no, no, no, no, no!

15:47.668 --> 15:48.636
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...
I want the bleach!

15:48.675 --> 15:50.835
-Ugh!
-Go on... board their boat, get our bleach,

15:50.860 --> 15:52.650
bleach the blob, do it now!

15:52.675 --> 15:54.531
The head, the head, the head.
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

15:54.555 --> 15:56.070
- The what?
- The toilet.

15:56.095 --> 15:57.845
- Flush the goods.
- The goods?

15:57.935 --> 15:59.795
The bleach. Dump the
bleach in the toilet.

15:59.820 --> 16:01.450
But won't that go into the ocean?

16:01.475 --> 16:03.645
No, there's a tank. God, you're so poor.

16:03.790 --> 16:05.460
Oops, sorry, Hench-folk.

16:05.485 --> 16:07.135
We just flushed it down the toilet.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.790
Now it's in the boat's butt.

16:08.815 --> 16:10.555
So annoying. Get off the boat,

16:10.580 --> 16:12.590
go to the store, buy some more bleach,

16:12.615 --> 16:14.575
save the receipt! And get ice.

16:14.705 --> 16:17.085
Well, we're gonna tell the
world that you bleached the bay.

16:17.115 --> 16:19.025
Go ahead. I'll deny it.

16:19.050 --> 16:22.220
Plus, no one cares. The
blob is bad, not the bleach.

16:22.245 --> 16:24.085
Bleach is good, it makes things clean.

16:24.110 --> 16:25.731
Haven't you ever seen
a bleach commercial?

16:25.755 --> 16:27.600
Don't lecture me about
bleach commercials,

16:27.625 --> 16:29.111
they're the reason why
I never felt the need

16:29.135 --> 16:30.769
to learn how to properly wipe.

16:30.794 --> 16:32.730
You know what? I don't
have any more time for this.

16:32.755 --> 16:35.375
The regatta is starting
soon and I gotta have

16:35.400 --> 16:37.990
my pre-regatta piña colada.

16:38.015 --> 16:39.935
Time for you kids to leave.

16:40.015 --> 16:41.725
That vessel is forbidden

16:41.765 --> 16:45.145
to ever enter the
Glencrest Marina again.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.620
So that's it? The baddies win?

16:46.645 --> 16:48.145
The little plankies die?

16:48.235 --> 16:51.025
No. We have to keep their bleach
boat away from the plankton.

16:51.050 --> 16:52.840
We got to go Greenpeace on their butts.

16:52.865 --> 16:55.685
But how? We're blocked from
even getting into the marina.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.550
What about if we sneak in?

16:57.575 --> 17:00.325
We'll have, uh, five
kayaks for a half-day rental.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.010
Sasha, the plastic?

17:02.035 --> 17:03.955
You got to be at least
18 to rent a boat.

17:03.980 --> 17:06.310
How about I throw in a crispy hundo?

17:06.335 --> 17:07.915
Hmm, I don't know.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.859
We're on a blob-itarian mission.

17:09.885 --> 17:11.611
Yeah, we need to rent five
of your best piddle-paddles

17:11.635 --> 17:13.635
- to save a blobby.
- Piddle-paddles?

17:13.714 --> 17:17.095
- The kayaks! Please!
- Go ahead, take the kayaks.

17:17.175 --> 17:18.734
- Give me the money.
- Aren't they gonna

17:18.765 --> 17:20.204
recognize us if we go back out there?

17:20.265 --> 17:21.645
Right. We need disguises.

17:21.765 --> 17:23.645
Do you have a lost and found?

17:23.724 --> 17:24.895
Uh, yeah, we do.

17:25.025 --> 17:26.655
- Good. 'Cause we lost this.
- Oh.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.060
- And this.
- Wow.

17:28.085 --> 17:29.525
- I'm glad we found this guy.
- Okay.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.956
Floral swimsuit cover-up? Mine.

17:34.130 --> 17:36.010
- How do we look?
- If Greenpeace looked

17:36.035 --> 17:38.285
as fabulous as us,
there'd be too many whales.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.550
The Hench-people are back.

17:40.575 --> 17:42.415
Spread out. Make a line.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.400
Get between the bleach
boat and the blob.

17:44.425 --> 17:45.805
Okay, no problem.

17:45.830 --> 17:47.790
I can definitely maneuver this boat.

17:47.815 --> 17:49.581
Guys, wh-where'd you go?

17:51.635 --> 17:53.075
Stop, you murderous Hench-jerks!

17:53.100 --> 17:54.440
You! In the blouse!

17:54.465 --> 17:56.875
It's a swimsuit cover-up, you rube!

17:56.900 --> 17:59.070
I don't care what it
is. Get out of my marina.

17:59.095 --> 18:01.305
No, and as blob is my witness,

18:01.330 --> 18:03.895
that bleach boat shall not pass.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.420
Will you hurry it up a bit?

18:05.445 --> 18:07.665
And will someone push
their kayaks into the sea?

18:07.690 --> 18:09.041
We're allowed to do that, right?

18:09.065 --> 18:13.340
- We're not going anywhere!
- Huh.

18:13.365 --> 18:15.035
Gene, keep banging your paddle.

18:15.060 --> 18:16.630
Gladly.

18:16.655 --> 18:19.615
Uh, I might sound
crazy, but it looked like

18:19.655 --> 18:22.365
- that blob just moved a little.
- That blob is a-moving.

18:22.495 --> 18:23.120
What?

18:23.145 --> 18:24.995
When you bang your paddle,
the blob moves away.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.020
You're right. It is moving away.

18:27.045 --> 18:28.675
Charles said it reacts to sounds.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.350
Charles said it reacts to sounds!

18:30.375 --> 18:32.005
Everyone, bang your paddles.

18:32.045 --> 18:34.545
Um, I thought we wanted to
keep the blob in the marina

18:34.570 --> 18:36.110
to embarrass Glencrest?

18:36.135 --> 18:38.175
Damn it, Sasha, this
isn't about Glencrest

18:38.265 --> 18:39.855
or Kingshead Island, it's about giving

18:39.880 --> 18:41.930
a misunderstood blob a chance.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.410
Damn it, Gene.

18:43.435 --> 18:45.855
You gave me goose bumps. Dunc,
are we on board with this?

18:45.935 --> 18:48.355
Sasha? M-My opinion on something?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.145
Never mind, forget it.
Gene, we're doing it.

18:50.235 --> 18:52.325
Come on. Let's Pied Piper this sucker.

18:52.395 --> 18:53.945
Technically, a reverse Pied Piper.

18:53.970 --> 18:56.615
Even the plankton wants to
get away from Gene's sounds.

18:56.655 --> 18:58.655
That's very insulting,
but I'm glad it worked.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.480
I told you my sounds have a purpose.

19:00.505 --> 19:02.180
What the hell are you waiting for?

19:02.205 --> 19:04.675
Push through the kayaks
and bleach the damn thing.

19:04.705 --> 19:07.205
We don't need to. It's
moving away on its own.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.860
Don't tell me you don't
need... Oh, yeah. Look at that.

19:09.885 --> 19:12.100
- It's working.
- Keep banging.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.075
Go, buddy. Back to the ocean.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.270
Back where you belong.

19:15.295 --> 19:16.885
- Yay.
- All right!

19:18.965 --> 19:20.425
Hmm.

19:20.515 --> 19:22.525
Maybe you were the beauty

19:22.595 --> 19:25.345
and I was the beast.

19:25.370 --> 19:28.420
It's time to regatta!

19:30.540 --> 19:32.000
Jimmy's back.

19:32.025 --> 19:34.452
Things are gonna change
when he meets the new Trev.

19:35.155 --> 19:36.615
You can do this, Trev.

19:36.695 --> 19:39.025
Uh, so, listen, Jimmy.

19:39.155 --> 19:40.755
I-I was thinking about
our dynamic and...

19:40.785 --> 19:42.155
Yeah, I had a great time, thanks.

19:42.195 --> 19:43.511
Check it out, I got you something.

19:43.535 --> 19:45.365
Whoa. You brought me back something?

19:45.455 --> 19:46.705
From Kokomo?

19:46.825 --> 19:48.535
A sexy lady bottle opener.

19:48.665 --> 19:49.915
Wow, Jimmy.

19:49.955 --> 19:52.125
- I love it.
- Yeah, well, don't get so mushy.

19:52.205 --> 19:54.215
Hey, look at Bob over there.

19:54.255 --> 19:55.925
I just got back from
vacation and already

19:56.060 --> 19:57.810
he's Jamaican me sad.

19:57.835 --> 19:59.921
Zoo-woom.

20:03.425 --> 20:05.765
'Cause you went to Jamaica.

20:05.845 --> 20:07.345
Yup, there it is.

20:07.370 --> 20:10.660
- I can't, my hand's sick.
- Ew, gross.

20:10.685 --> 20:12.595
Wow, Lin, you did that.

20:12.620 --> 20:14.160
I didn't think that was gonna work,

20:14.185 --> 20:16.235
but you might have helped
Trev grow up a little bit.

20:16.355 --> 20:18.525
Hey, Bob. Bob.

20:18.565 --> 20:20.305
- Hey, Bob.
- What, Jimmy?

20:20.330 --> 20:24.275
Trev here, he just told me
you got a peehole birthmark.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.970
Whoa! Let me see it.

20:25.995 --> 20:27.455
- Great.
- You wish you had

20:27.480 --> 20:29.140
a peehole birthmark.

20:29.165 --> 20:30.995
- Oh, they're gone.
- You got 'em, Lin.

20:31.020 --> 20:32.180
High five.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.100
How you doing, Gene?

20:34.125 --> 20:36.255
I didn't think it'd be
so hard to say goodbye.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.190
But now the blob will live in peace...

20:38.215 --> 20:39.635
What's happening?

20:39.820 --> 20:41.110
It's getting eaten up.

20:41.135 --> 20:42.385
Oh, oh, wow.

20:42.410 --> 20:44.870
- That is rough to watch.
- Yeah. Ugh.

20:44.895 --> 20:46.910
If any of you survive whatever's

20:46.935 --> 20:48.445
violently attacking you now,

20:48.470 --> 20:50.680
I'll see you inside an oyster.
