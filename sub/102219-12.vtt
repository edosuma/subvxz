Hey.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.039
-You have my mini blender?
-What mini blender?

00:39.122 --> 00:42.292
The one that you borrowed
to make piña coladas.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.295
-No, I gave it back to you.
-I can't find it.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.505
Maybe you loaned it to someone else.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.549
[Beth] <i>No one else borrows a blender.</i>

00:49.632 --> 00:50.967
So, maybe you lost it.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.761
Where would I lose it, Annie?

00:52.844 --> 00:55.346
If you knew that, it wouldn't be lost.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.182
Can you please just look?

00:57.265 --> 00:59.476
Chillax. I'm looking.

Nope. Don't see it.

It's red with a black lid.

-Silver button?
-Yep.

Yeah, I think so.

Dishwasher safe?

01:15.575 --> 01:16.910
Do you have it?

01:16.993 --> 01:18.328
I'll keep looking.

01:18.995 --> 01:22.040
If you find it,
can you bring it by here tomorrow?

01:22.123 --> 01:24.084
-What time?
<i>-Early.</i>

01:24.167 --> 01:26.044
-I have work.
-Before that.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.130
-Why do you need it?
-It doesn't matter! It's mine!

01:30.673 --> 01:34.135
Except that when I borrow something
from you, I have to bring it back.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.763
When you borrow,
I still have to bring it back.

01:36.846 --> 01:39.015
I just have a lot going on tomorrow. Okay?

01:39.098 --> 01:40.475

[sighs wearily] Okay.
You know what? That's fine.

01:49.567 --> 01:53.113
I won't take Ben to school,
have any money to give him for lunch

01:53.196 --> 01:54.739
because I'll have to skip work,

01:54.823 --> 01:58.243

can have his nutritious morning smoothie.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.204
I thought you didn't have it.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.955
Get your coat.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.249
Why?

02:47.041 --> 02:48.209
'Cause you'll be cold.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.880
Cold 'cause I'm dead?

Your shoes, too.

-My son's gonna be home any minute.
-Mmm-hmm.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.017
We should probably hustle then, huh?

03:09.522 --> 03:10.940
Gonna wonder where I am.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.775
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

-She deletes them all.
-That's not gonna help.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.973
What about the crime ring
she ran through my store?

06:31.057 --> 06:34.477
-That's the problem. It was yours.
-You need something that's hers.

06:34.560 --> 06:36.604
What about the fake money she's printing?

06:36.687 --> 06:38.481
On the press that you built.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.566
I read her emails.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.861
I tore through her car,
dug around in her underwear drawers.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.530
-Nothing.
-She keep a journal?

07:07.677 --> 07:08.719
Then what's it about?

07:11.305 --> 07:13.683
It's about sewing your sack back on.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.436
Right now, you don't even need
that seat on your bike.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.771
He's right. Just sit on the post.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.273
-Guys--
-There you go.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.358
-Give me my bike seat.
-You don't need it.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.820

-Then give us something we can use.

-I'm gonna call your dad.

-Was there anything missing?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.259
There's nothing to take.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.807
Maybe you should call the police.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.855
You know…

08:44.357 --> 08:46.526
I think I might know who she's with.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.864
Don't forget
to subtract the cost of goods.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.824
Um, what's that?

08:53.908 --> 08:57.286
It's the cost of everything

-Business.
-Teaching baby girl accounting.

Um, so this is Aunt Beth's pile.
This is Annie's and this is ours.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.178

-I'm gonna need all of it.

That an expense or a loan?

Just straight-up theft, baby.

What's this?

09:28.442 --> 09:29.860
First installment.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.862
We'll get the rest.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.198
-Oh, I know you will.
-Give her back.

Guess we'll call it even.

-I don't wanna be even!
-She ain't worth more than that.

These are two for one.

Except for the fact
that I'm being kidnapped by him.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.230
So, make an excuse.
Go call the cops. Please! Really quick.

-Hey, bro.
-What's up? How's your moms?

12:14.608 --> 12:16.610
You always worry. You should stop by.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.237
I definitely will, um…

12:18.988 --> 12:21.115
Can we get a couple of Slurpee cups?

12:22.575 --> 12:23.951
I don't want a Slurpee.

It's not for that.

-Help me get her back!
-Not so easy.

13:09.788 --> 13:12.041
-Why not?
-I can't be anywhere near that.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.376
Now he's not your brother or whatever?

-My money can't wait.

28:43.972 --> 28:47.517
See, that's your problem.
You never were a big-picture guy.

-'Cause I don't see it your way?
-No.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.646
Never did.

-It's like they say.
-What?

28:55.942 --> 28:57.902
"Keep your eye on the ball."

29:01.531 --> 29:04.617
-You know what else they say?
-I think you're gonna tell me.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.582
I hope you're right.

-No, not that.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.361
I don't hear anything.

29:41.946 --> 29:42.822
Exactly.

Because Annie's not in the back seat,

of 1,000 beestings

or be mauled by a bear.

-That one's her fave.
-'Cause she thinks there's a right answer.

Bees.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.004
The bear.

29:59.756 --> 30:03.510
Bees. 'Cause eventually you go numb.

30:03.593 --> 30:06.471
-And you don't feel it anymore.
-The bear's faster.

30:06.554 --> 30:09.390
Not if it starts at your feet
and works its way up.

30:10.058 --> 30:13.144
What if the bees decide
to sting you one at a time?

30:13.228 --> 30:15.605
Like they're waiting in line at the DMV?

30:18.024 --> 30:21.945
-If she was here, she'd settle it.
-She'd tell us we're both wrong.

30:23.279 --> 30:25.365
It's just weird not having her around.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.289
It would be weird
not having you around, either.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.088
He told you?

30:42.382 --> 30:44.676
You should never
have had to make that deal.

Come on.

30:49.055 --> 30:50.223
Seriously.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.725
No boy's gonna break us up.

Say you were allergic to bees.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.324
Fine, bees.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.581
-Now, let's go get Annie back.
-Okay.

31:17.667 --> 31:18.918
She's here right now.

-Better than my knock-off bag.

-Mmm.
-This isn't the right place for you.

-You're not a right fit.

-Our offer.

31:45.862 --> 31:49.616

-Well, this is way less than I paid.

Did you witness anything?

33:51.070 --> 33:51.904

-First-degree murder.
-Pardon?

34:10.965 --> 34:14.135
Like Lizzie Borden,
except the hatchet is his--

34:14.218 --> 34:16.054
So he didn't assault this man?

he wouldn't have had the energy.
