00:01.367 --> 00:03.333
Kal Penn:
 Ladies and gentlemen,

00:03.333 --> 00:05.333
five seemingly
ordinary people

00:05.333 --> 00:06.867
are going to rewrite
the rule book

00:06.867 --> 00:09.033
on what
the human mind can do.

00:10.133 --> 00:11.367
Memorize the order.

00:11.367 --> 00:13.066
Blue, red, blue.

00:13.066 --> 00:14.800
The next one
should be a red.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.367
Now this is
extremely difficult.

00:18.166 --> 00:20.633
Memorize the schedules
for three kids.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.100
Soccer, marching band,
karate.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.066
( cheers, applause )

00:26.066 --> 00:29.100
This was mesmerizing
to watch.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.166
Give me the total
number of pips

00:31.166 --> 00:33.000
before
the last domino falls.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.967
- 535.
- No way.

00:34.967 --> 00:36.734
What was
the actual total?

00:36.734 --> 00:38.300
( crowd gasps )

00:38.300 --> 00:40.266
I was actually
an amateur boxer
for a few years.

00:40.266 --> 00:41.633
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:41.633 --> 00:42.633
I'd be honored if you
were to kick my ass.

00:42.633 --> 00:44.834
( laughter )

00:44.834 --> 00:48.100
The winner
of the $50,000,

00:48.100 --> 00:50.200
and the title
of SuperHuman is...

00:51.266 --> 00:52.400
That was amazing!

00:52.400 --> 00:53.767
- That was awesome.
- Whoo!

00:53.767 --> 00:55.800
Got it! Wow!

00:55.800 --> 00:57.633
50 Gs!

00:59.734 --> 01:02.567
( cheers, applause )

01:02.567 --> 01:03.633
Hey, guys!

01:03.633 --> 01:05.567
( cheers, applause )

01:05.567 --> 01:07.133
Thank you!

01:09.934 --> 01:11.600
All right.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.500
( cheers, applause )

01:15.900 --> 01:17.500
Welcome to "SuperHuman"!

01:19.100 --> 01:21.934
Tonight, five seemingly
ordinary people

01:21.934 --> 01:25.033
are going to compete
in impossible challenges,

01:25.033 --> 01:26.633
and rewrite
the rule book

01:26.633 --> 01:29.567
on what the human mind
and body can do.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.700
$50,000

01:31.700 --> 01:34.667
and the title of SuperHuman
are on the line.

01:35.767 --> 01:38.500
And they'll be
assessed by our panel,

01:38.500 --> 01:40.200
and they're all superhumans
in their own right.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.300
First, at age--
just age 20,

01:43.300 --> 01:46.800
he was the youngest ever
heavyweight champion
of the world.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.667
It's the man they call
the baddest man
on the planet,

01:49.667 --> 01:52.433
- Mike Tyson!
- I try, I try.

01:52.433 --> 01:55.133
- I try, I try.
- ( cheers, applause )

01:55.133 --> 01:58.300
Next, a singer,
songwriter and actress.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.834
She was described
as "a genius"

02:00.834 --> 02:02.166
by a top music magazine.

02:02.166 --> 02:04.367
- It's Christina Milian.
- Oh, hi.

02:04.367 --> 02:05.567
- ( laughs )
- ( cheers, applause )

02:07.033 --> 02:10.600
Finally, just when you're
sitting there thinking

02:10.600 --> 02:12.500
"They're gonna need
a brain surgeon
on this show,"

02:12.500 --> 02:13.533
we've got one.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.100
Bringing his
professional insight,

02:15.100 --> 02:17.667
here's brain surgeon,
neuroscientist,

02:17.667 --> 02:20.133
and professor of medicine
Dr. Rahul Jandial.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.033
( cheers, applause )

02:23.700 --> 02:25.000
All right.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.200
The panelists will need
to stay on their toes tonight,

02:27.200 --> 02:30.033
because after seeing five
unbelievable challenges

02:30.033 --> 02:32.433
they'll have to choose
the top three

02:32.433 --> 02:33.700
and then our audience

02:33.700 --> 02:36.533
will pick the winner
of $50,000.

02:36.533 --> 02:38.433
- ( cheers, applause )
- Here we go!

02:38.433 --> 02:41.033
Our first contestant's
math skills

02:41.033 --> 02:43.166
surpassed even
his teachers',

02:43.166 --> 02:46.533
and sometimes
made him the target
of schoolyard bullies.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.567
But at ten years old,
he earned the nickname "Domino,"

02:49.567 --> 02:50.633
and for good reason.

02:50.633 --> 02:52.467
He's Chris Authement.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.367
( cheers, applause )

02:55.934 --> 02:56.934
Chris:
 I'm Chris Authement,

02:56.934 --> 02:58.400
and my superhuman
ability is

02:58.400 --> 02:59.567
I'm a mental math genius.

02:59.567 --> 03:01.767
Numbers come
so natural to me.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.800
There's no end
to what I can do.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
I can add numbers
for hours.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.633
I can multiply numbers
for hours.

03:06.633 --> 03:08.934
I always knew I was
very good with numbers.

03:08.934 --> 03:10.734
I started playing
dominoes when I was seven,

03:10.734 --> 03:11.900
and I was
obsessed with it,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.233
so they just started
calling me "Domino,"

03:13.233 --> 03:14.700
and it stuck ever since.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.834
To me, I always thought
it was cool but normal.

03:17.834 --> 03:19.000
Growing up, it was tough.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.367
Kids are mean,
let's face it.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.834
They see someone
that's different than them

03:22.834 --> 03:24.400
and they bully you
a little bit.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.066
It definitely affected
me at the time,

03:26.066 --> 03:27.800
but to me, that makes me
a better person.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.066
It makes me
who I am today.

03:29.066 --> 03:30.800
I'm gonna go out there,
I'm gonna have a good time,

03:30.800 --> 03:33.734
and hopefully,
America will fall
in love with me.

03:33.734 --> 03:35.233
( cheers, applause )

03:35.233 --> 03:37.066
From Houston, Texas,

03:37.066 --> 03:38.867
here's Chris Authement.

03:38.867 --> 03:41.333
- ( cheers, applause )
- Let's go, baby!

03:41.333 --> 03:44.300
- Whoo!
- ( cheers, applause )

03:44.300 --> 03:45.633
- What's up, buddy?
- Yeah, how you doing?

03:45.633 --> 03:46.700
Good, welcome
to the show!

03:46.700 --> 03:47.900
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.400
I was scared that
that was gonna knock over

03:49.400 --> 03:52.166
the dominos already
before we got started.

03:52.166 --> 03:55.767
All right, your challenge
is called Domino Effect.

03:55.767 --> 03:59.567
There are 100 giant dominoes
standing in this line.

03:59.567 --> 04:02.567
You're going to use your
incredible mental math power

04:02.567 --> 04:04.433
to work your way
down the line

04:04.433 --> 04:06.500
and add up all the pips
on the dominoes.

04:06.500 --> 04:07.800
But there's a catch.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.934
After 20 seconds,
I will knock over
that first domino

04:11.934 --> 04:13.367
and we all know
what happens next,

04:13.367 --> 04:15.433
and trust me,
they fall really fast.

04:15.433 --> 04:18.200
You'll have to give me
the total number of pips

04:18.200 --> 04:20.500
before the last
domino falls.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.734
Chris, are you ready?

04:23.734 --> 04:25.200
Ready as I'll ever be.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.800
Your challenge
starts now.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.333
( cheers, applause )

04:30.333 --> 04:33.400
Domino! Domino!
Domino!

04:33.400 --> 04:37.500
Three, two, one.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.633
( timer beeping )

05:17.266 --> 05:19.700
- 535.
- 535?

05:19.700 --> 05:21.300
- ( cheers, applause )
- Whoo! Okay!

05:21.300 --> 05:23.633
- Oh!
- Come on, baby!

05:23.633 --> 05:27.133
All right,
Chris is saying 535.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.500
What was
the actual total?

05:35.033 --> 05:36.200
535!

05:36.200 --> 05:38.233
- Congratulations!
- ( cheers, applause )

05:38.233 --> 05:40.266
( cheers, applause )

05:43.166 --> 05:44.633
Oh, what a rush.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.967
- That was awesome.
- Whoo!

05:46.967 --> 05:48.867
All right,
we gotta throw this
to the panel. Christina?

05:48.867 --> 05:51.500
You gave
an awesome performance.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.533
Am I right, guys?

05:52.533 --> 05:53.900
- ( cheers, applause )
- That was--

05:53.900 --> 05:55.567
Like the way you
brought the energy,

05:55.567 --> 05:57.200
your confidence,
it was beautiful.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.600
You did what
you came to do.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.667
- Thank you, thank you.
- Good job.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.033
- Thank you.
- Penn: Dr. Jandial,

06:01.033 --> 06:03.000
how specifically
is Chris's brain

06:03.000 --> 06:04.367
wired differently
than ours

06:04.367 --> 06:05.533
and what allows him
to actually do this?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.934
First of all,
he's using REM,

06:07.934 --> 06:09.066
rapid eye movements.

06:09.066 --> 06:10.734
Typically,
that's when we sleep.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.967
Somehow, he's harnessed that
while he's awake

06:12.967 --> 06:15.066
to follow all of
these crashing dominos

06:15.066 --> 06:17.000
or to count up
all of these dots.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.533
The other thing is,

06:18.533 --> 06:20.900
vision goes to
the back of your brain,
at the occipital lobe,

06:20.900 --> 06:23.266
but short-term memory
where you're keeping
track of everything,

06:23.266 --> 06:24.734
is in the frontal lobe.

06:24.734 --> 06:27.300
And I can just
imagine like a river of
electrical signals

06:27.300 --> 06:28.867
streaming back and forth,

06:28.867 --> 06:30.266
all in a fraction
of a second, man.

06:30.266 --> 06:32.166
I was really impressed.
High energy.

06:32.166 --> 06:33.834
High focus.
Clutch performer.

06:33.834 --> 06:35.500
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.867
Mike, Chris was
going up against the clock
for his challenge, right?

06:38.867 --> 06:41.133
When you're in the ring,
how do you stay aware

06:41.133 --> 06:42.934
of how much time
is left in each round?

06:42.934 --> 06:44.700
You just are.
It's instinct.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.767
Get rid of your tension
and you relax

06:46.767 --> 06:48.133
and you flow
in your blood,

06:48.133 --> 06:49.600
and that was just amazing.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.633
You were fast
and you were charismatic
with your energy.

06:51.633 --> 06:53.767
- You made it awesome.
- ( cheers, applause )

06:53.767 --> 06:55.800
Did you ever think
that you and Mike Tyson

06:55.800 --> 06:57.867
would bond on something
you both understand?

06:57.867 --> 06:59.934
that I think none of us
in this room can comprehend?

06:59.934 --> 07:01.834
No, six-year-old Chris
never imagined that.

07:01.834 --> 07:03.767
- How awesome is that?
- It's pretty fantastic.

07:03.767 --> 07:05.867
I've been following
Mike for a long time,
followed his career.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.266
Absolutely love it.
Always been a big fan, man.

07:07.266 --> 07:08.266
Thank you.

07:08.266 --> 07:10.600
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.700
Chris's super fast
math skills

07:12.700 --> 07:15.767
could win him $50,000.

07:15.767 --> 07:18.166
The panelists will pick
tonight's top three
contestants,

07:18.166 --> 07:19.500
and then from those three,

07:19.500 --> 07:21.500
the audience
will decide who wins.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.567
Right now, one more time
for Chris Authement!

07:24.567 --> 07:27.266
Thanks, buddy.
I appreciate it.
Nicely done.

07:27.266 --> 07:28.667
( cheers, applause )

07:30.433 --> 07:32.834
Your job is to memorize
the schedule.

07:32.834 --> 07:34.367
This is
extremely difficult.

07:34.367 --> 07:37.266
You have soccer,
marching band, karate.

07:37.266 --> 07:39.867
This is why my children
have no activities.

07:39.867 --> 07:41.266
( laughter )

07:46.000 --> 07:49.667
( cheers, applause )

07:49.667 --> 07:52.400
Welcome back
to "SuperHuman"!

07:52.400 --> 07:53.934
( cheers, applause )

07:53.934 --> 07:56.100
Our next contestant
has trained her brain

07:56.100 --> 07:57.800
to become
a memory master,

07:57.800 --> 08:00.133
and inspire
everyone she meets.

08:00.133 --> 08:02.367
She is Tatiana Marquardt.

08:02.367 --> 08:04.467
( cheers, applause )

08:04.467 --> 08:06.734
Tatiana:
 My name is Tatiana Marquardt,

08:06.734 --> 08:09.100
and my superhuman ability
is memory.

08:09.100 --> 08:12.033
I'm very visual,
so it's like a Rolodex,

08:12.033 --> 08:14.734
you know, so when I'm trying
to recall a name

08:14.734 --> 08:16.567
for example, I'm like--
( imitates Rolodex flipping )

08:16.567 --> 08:19.734
My home life is
kind of chaotic,

08:19.734 --> 08:21.834
'cause I have three kids.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.333
I'm also fairly
absent-minded.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.300
Where are my glasses?

08:26.300 --> 08:27.734
Did you take them?

08:27.734 --> 08:29.633
I love my kids fiercely,

08:29.633 --> 08:33.866
and I kind of feel like
my superhuman ability

08:33.866 --> 08:35.900
is that I'm a badass mom,

08:35.900 --> 08:37.967
but don't judge a book
by its cover.

08:37.967 --> 08:40.533
I will come in here
and beat all of you.

08:40.533 --> 08:42.265
( laughs )

08:42.265 --> 08:44.265
( cheers, applause )

08:44.265 --> 08:46.033
From Berkeley,
California,

08:46.033 --> 08:48.667
here's super mom,
Tatiana Marquardt!

08:48.667 --> 08:50.567
( cheers, applause )

08:56.467 --> 08:57.967
- How are you?
- I'm good, how are you?

08:57.967 --> 09:00.100
- Good, welcome
to "SuperHuman."
- Thank you.

09:00.100 --> 09:02.133
Okay, your kids are actually
here tonight, right?

09:02.133 --> 09:03.667
- They are.
- Hey, guys!

09:03.667 --> 09:05.033
( cheers, applause )

09:05.033 --> 09:06.367
Welcome to the show.

09:06.367 --> 09:08.567
Okay, Tatiana,

09:08.567 --> 09:10.934
your challenge is called

09:10.934 --> 09:13.633
Just Another Manic MomDay.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.300
- ( laughter )
- This is a challenge

09:15.300 --> 09:17.300
any mom can
relate to.

09:17.300 --> 09:20.233
We're about to show you
a long list of activities

09:20.233 --> 09:23.667
that three children
will be taking part in
over one week,

09:23.667 --> 09:26.834
from soccer practice
to ballet lessons
to cheerleading practice

09:26.834 --> 09:30.934
Your job is to memorize
the entire week's schedule

09:30.934 --> 09:32.767
for all three kids.

09:32.767 --> 09:34.333
Because once you have,

09:34.333 --> 09:36.233
you'll need to pack
each kid's bag

09:36.233 --> 09:39.467
with the correct items
for all three of those days.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.834
Okay, Tatiana,
are you ready to see
this week's schedule?

09:41.834 --> 09:42.834
- Yes.
- All right.

09:42.834 --> 09:45.700
Your challenge
starts now.

10:04.533 --> 10:06.066
Wednesdays...

10:07.166 --> 10:09.600
( mutters )

10:09.600 --> 10:12.867
Rebecca,
paint.

10:12.867 --> 10:14.533
Fridays...

10:14.533 --> 10:15.967
( mutters, exhales )

10:18.667 --> 10:20.567
- Okay.
- ( cheers, applause )

10:23.133 --> 10:25.166
Penn:
Okay, one by one,

10:25.166 --> 10:27.467
our panelists
will each pick

10:27.467 --> 10:30.066
one day of the week
for each child.

10:30.066 --> 10:33.300
- Mike.
- I like Carter
and I like Wednesday.

10:33.300 --> 10:36.367
- Christina.
- I'm gonna go with
Mason on a Monday.

10:36.367 --> 10:39.133
Okay, Dr. Jandial,
that leaves you
with Natalie.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.200
Please pick
a day of the week.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.133
- Friday.
- All right, Tatiana.

10:42.133 --> 10:44.500
everything you could need
is on the shelves.

11:22.367 --> 11:24.333
Crafts,
arts and crafts.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.400
Um...

11:49.967 --> 11:52.133
Marching band...

11:52.133 --> 11:54.300
Okay.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.467
Okay.

11:58.900 --> 12:00.567
- Okay.
- Penn: Okay.

12:00.567 --> 12:03.633
To help us assess
whether Tatiana packed
the bags correctly,

12:03.633 --> 12:05.166
please welcome
three experts.

12:05.166 --> 12:07.266
Carter, Mason
and Natalie.

12:07.266 --> 12:09.166
( cheers, applause )

12:11.667 --> 12:13.700
Oh, my goodness.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.433
Penn:
Hey, guys.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.834
All right.

12:21.834 --> 12:25.333
Carter, Tatiana packed
a bag for you

12:25.333 --> 12:26.867
for Wednesday.

12:26.867 --> 12:29.533
Let's see if you got
everything you need.

12:29.533 --> 12:32.667
First up,
you have soccer.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.400
- Cleat.
- You do have cleats.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.533
( cheers, applause )

12:37.533 --> 12:39.367
Next, you have
a birthday party.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.200
- ( cheers, applause )
- Birthday present.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.400
There you go, wow.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.934
Next on the list
is photography club.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.100
A very heavy camera.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.700
A very heavy camera!

12:52.700 --> 12:55.133
And finally,
we have choir.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.100
- Choir.
- All right.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.500
Sheet music for choir.
You got the whole bag right.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.934
Wow.
All right, Mason.

13:06.934 --> 13:09.600
Tatiana packed a bag
for you for Monday.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.500
First up, we have
arts and crafts.

13:17.133 --> 13:19.967
That's right.
That's for arts and crafts.

13:21.266 --> 13:23.767
Next up is karate.

13:25.934 --> 13:28.934
Wow, that fits
in that bag, nice.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.900
Next up,
tap dancing.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.934
Yeah, tap shoes.

13:36.934 --> 13:39.900
And finally, you should
have science club.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.266
( cheers, applause )

13:47.266 --> 13:49.500
Two for two!

13:49.500 --> 13:51.300
Okay, Natalie,
Tatiana packed

13:51.300 --> 13:53.400
a bag for you
for Friday.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.300
First up
is gymnastics.

13:57.734 --> 13:59.133
It's a leotard
for gymnastics.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.100
( cheers, applause )

14:03.633 --> 14:05.934
Okay, Natalie,
next up...

14:05.934 --> 14:07.367
is marching band.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.133
There's the huge trumpet.

14:14.934 --> 14:17.400
Next we have
magic class.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.700
It's a hat, yeah.

14:23.700 --> 14:25.867
That was it.
There you go.

14:25.867 --> 14:28.500
( cheers, applause )

14:28.500 --> 14:30.734
So finally,
the last item

14:30.734 --> 14:34.300
on Natalie's schedule
is drama class.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.633
"Romeo and Juliet."

14:42.633 --> 14:43.967
( cheers, applause )

14:43.967 --> 14:46.767
You got 'em all!
Three out of three!

14:46.767 --> 14:48.800
Oh, man!

14:48.800 --> 14:50.367
( cheers, applause )

14:50.367 --> 14:52.600
That's insane.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.033
Tatiana:
Oh, my God.

14:54.033 --> 14:56.000
Oh, my gosh.

14:58.166 --> 15:01.100
Dr. Jandial, you have
a little experience

15:01.100 --> 15:02.667
with studying
people's brains.

15:02.667 --> 15:05.066
Did you expect
Tatiana to do so well?

15:05.066 --> 15:06.433
No, this is
extremely difficult.

15:06.433 --> 15:08.333
I'm very
impressed by you.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.934
- We have a filing cabinet
in our brain.
- Thank you.

15:09.934 --> 15:11.867
It's got a cool name,
the hippocampus.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.500
But you took it
to a new level.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.000
- Thank you.
- Holding on to all
this information.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.800
( cheers, applause )

15:18.800 --> 15:23.300
That challenge
could have won
Tatiana $50,000.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.467
- Yeah.
- 50 G's!

15:25.467 --> 15:27.633
The panel and the audience
will decide at the end
of the show.

15:27.633 --> 15:30.533
Right now let's hear it
for Tatiana Marquardt!

15:36.967 --> 15:39.133
Language is
the trickiest thing
the brain does.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.066
Uh, what could that be?

15:41.066 --> 15:42.633
30 seconds.

15:42.633 --> 15:43.633
Darn.

15:43.633 --> 15:45.133
Oh, boy.

15:45.133 --> 15:46.033
No way.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.500
( cheers, applause )

15:54.500 --> 15:56.433
Welcome back!

15:58.100 --> 16:00.100
Here's a contestant
who can finish

16:00.100 --> 16:02.400
"The New York Times"
crossword puzzle

16:02.400 --> 16:03.467
in three minutes.

16:03.467 --> 16:04.500
He's Tyler Hinman.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.000
( cheers, applause )

16:08.300 --> 16:09.500
I'm Tyler Hinman,

16:09.500 --> 16:11.767
and my superhuman ability
is I can solve

16:11.767 --> 16:13.100
the most complicated
word puzzles

16:13.100 --> 16:15.166
very, very fast
and accurately.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.600
There's a little
part of my brain that
can never resist

16:17.600 --> 16:19.800
trying to do something,
wordplay-wise.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.800
It definitely helps
with solving puzzles.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.600
It sounds kind of silly,
but it's been kind of
an amazing trail

16:25.600 --> 16:28.133
throughout my life
that puzzles have kind of
carved for me.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.233
I owe a lot to them.
It's really taken my life

16:30.233 --> 16:31.500
in a bunch of
great directions.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.800
Who knows what could
come of this enterprise?

16:33.800 --> 16:35.734
But I'm really looking forward
to finding out.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.600
( cheers, applause )

16:37.600 --> 16:39.767
From San Francisco,
California,

16:39.767 --> 16:41.400
here's Tyler Hinman.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.300
( cheers, applause )

16:45.233 --> 16:46.600
- Hey, guy.
- How are you?

16:46.600 --> 16:48.834
Welcome to "SuperHuman."
Nice to meet you.

16:48.834 --> 16:50.967
- Thank you.
- I like the excitement
already.

16:50.967 --> 16:52.033
I can tell you're
pumped to be here.

16:52.033 --> 16:53.433
- Absolutely.
- All right, man.

16:53.433 --> 16:55.700
Your challenge
is called Gridlock.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.166
All right.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.734
- You'll see five
word puzzles.
- All right.

16:59.734 --> 17:02.500
Each puzzle is a grid
that looks like this.

17:02.500 --> 17:05.500
You must use letters
from a nine-letter word--

17:05.500 --> 17:07.165
in this case,
"knowledge,"

17:07.165 --> 17:10.333
to fill in the nine
empty spaces in the grid.

17:10.333 --> 17:15.165
For example, you can use
the letters N, G and E
to spell "anger."

17:15.165 --> 17:18.532
Then you'd use
the six remaining letters
and place them,

17:18.532 --> 17:21.000
so that six individual
words are spelled.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.099
That's three words
left to right,

17:23.099 --> 17:24.900
and three words
top to bottom.

17:26.066 --> 17:28.032
Tyler, you're going
to have to do

17:28.032 --> 17:30.000
five of these
puzzles at once.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.834
- Great.
- And to add
an extra wrinkle

17:31.834 --> 17:33.667
we're gonna give you
five nine-letter words,

17:33.667 --> 17:37.100
but you'll have
to figure out which
puzzle they fit.

17:37.100 --> 17:38.367
- Get out.
- All right, does
that make sense?

17:38.367 --> 17:39.467
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:39.467 --> 17:42.333
You'll have three minutes
and 30 seconds.

17:42.333 --> 17:45.433
to fill in
the blank spaces
in each puzzle.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.166
So Tyler, are you ready
for your challenge?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.166
Let's do it.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.233
Please step up
to the podium.

17:50.233 --> 17:52.133
( cheers, applause )

17:55.934 --> 17:59.433
All right, Tyler,
your challenge starts now.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.000
Okay. Oh, that's a lot
of "or's" on there.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.100
All right,
what do we got?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.467
That's gonna be a vowel
right there, maybe.

18:09.467 --> 18:11.266
No, not "creek," uh...

18:11.266 --> 18:14.767
"Cloak," maybe?
By the L.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.934
Not really.
Oh, that's an L.

18:16.934 --> 18:19.567
Uh...
maybe "slimy."

18:19.567 --> 18:20.700
All right,
what do I have left?

18:20.700 --> 18:21.900
L, I, M, O, A.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.667
Maybe "small," "coral,"
"birds" and "ladle."

18:24.667 --> 18:26.567
I think that's
got that, great.

18:26.567 --> 18:28.533
Uh, how about
"karma" there?

18:28.533 --> 18:31.333
Not many words could fit there
and I don't see letters
for "koala."

18:31.333 --> 18:33.533
That looks like it fits
"macaroons" maybe.

18:33.533 --> 18:36.166
C, A-- Oh, maybe
it's "margarita" actually.

18:36.166 --> 18:37.633
I actually like that
a whole lot better.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.166
'Cause maybe
that's "faith,"

18:39.166 --> 18:40.967
and then "vital,"

18:40.967 --> 18:43.200
and then "image."
What do I have left?

18:43.200 --> 18:45.767
I have R.
That's interesting.

18:45.767 --> 18:48.600
Where's my eraser?
Okay, let's move on
a little bit.

18:48.600 --> 18:52.667
How about "kneel"?

18:52.667 --> 18:54.433
Oh, I.
"Amino."

18:54.433 --> 18:55.867
Like amino acids.

18:55.867 --> 18:56.967
"Mine."

18:56.967 --> 18:59.900
( mutters )

18:59.900 --> 19:04.266
"Smart," "grief,"
and "digit" and "lager."
Great.

19:04.266 --> 19:05.567
( cheers, applause )

19:05.567 --> 19:07.767
I don't have an L anywhere,
that's critical.

19:07.767 --> 19:10.133
What could that be?
Maybe-- oh, that's gotta
be an H.

19:10.133 --> 19:12.633
I think that has--
"Echinacea," that's a word.

19:12.633 --> 19:13.800
Maybe "decal"?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.967
Oh, "cheek."

19:16.967 --> 19:19.567
Oh, what do I have left?
E, C.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.934
E-C-H-I-N-A...

19:21.934 --> 19:24.500
"Shack," "tacit," "feint."

19:24.500 --> 19:26.367
Penn: You're more
than halfway there, Tyler.

19:26.367 --> 19:27.867
Two more grids.

19:27.867 --> 19:31.467
Uh, okay.
I like "margarita"
on there, let's see.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.033
One minute.

19:33.033 --> 19:35.567
Oh, boy.

19:35.567 --> 19:36.667
Oh, man.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.300
Darn, uh...

19:39.767 --> 19:42.100
Let's see...
Uh, man.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.233
No way.

19:43.233 --> 19:45.000
Oh, how about "vocal" here?

19:46.767 --> 19:49.667
I still like
"karma" there.

19:49.667 --> 19:50.867
30 seconds.

19:50.867 --> 19:53.233
( growls )
Eraser.

19:56.467 --> 19:58.967
"Viral."
Jeez, okay.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.867
( cheers, applause )

20:04.367 --> 20:06.600
Damn.
"Acorn."

20:15.700 --> 20:19.300
"Sonar," "canoe,"
"stamp," "cross."

20:19.300 --> 20:20.800
( bell dings )

20:20.800 --> 20:23.533
( cheers, applause )

20:23.533 --> 20:26.200
Penn:
Five out of five correct!

20:26.200 --> 20:27.667
( cheers, applause )

20:27.667 --> 20:30.133
That was amazing!

20:30.133 --> 20:32.900
- Oh, my gosh!
- Whoo! Yeah!

20:35.233 --> 20:37.967
You know that the clock
literally hit zero
as you finished.

20:37.967 --> 20:39.467
Oh, yeah.
It was definitely
right down to the wire

20:39.467 --> 20:40.467
particularly
that last grid,

20:40.467 --> 20:42.433
as my handwriting
will attest.

20:42.433 --> 20:43.700
( laughter )

20:43.700 --> 20:46.000
You, my friend,
are like a human
thesaurus.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.400
- Thanks.
- That was incredible.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.233
You want to write
a song together?

20:49.233 --> 20:50.533
Yeah, let's do it.

20:50.533 --> 20:52.233
Penn: Dr. Jandial,
how do you explain

20:52.233 --> 20:53.667
what we just saw
from Tyler?

20:53.667 --> 20:55.300
Jandial:
This was mesmerizing.

20:55.300 --> 20:57.467
The brain is the most
complicated thing in
the known universe.

20:57.467 --> 21:00.533
And language, problem solving,
a little bit of math,

21:00.533 --> 21:02.333
is the trickiest thing
the brain does,

21:02.333 --> 21:04.967
and somehow,
in his brain,

21:04.967 --> 21:06.734
those two areas
are right next
to each other.

21:06.734 --> 21:08.567
Think of two houses
in a busy city,

21:08.567 --> 21:10.100
and they happen
to be neighbors.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.900
Problem solving
and language.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.367
He just broke
down the fence

21:13.367 --> 21:15.400
and had free flow
of information going
between them.

21:15.400 --> 21:18.100
- That was awesome.
- Thank you,
appreciate it.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.500
All right, is that
enough to win?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.400
It's all up to the panel
and the audience.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.200
Right now, let's hear it
for Tyler Hinman.
Thanks, buddy.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.100
( cheers, applause )

21:32.900 --> 21:35.133
Your job is
to memorize the order.

21:35.133 --> 21:36.767
- Column 15.
- Jandial: Row three.

21:36.767 --> 21:37.767
Right to left.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.133
First one
should be a blue.

21:39.133 --> 21:41.600
Red. The next one
should be a red.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.000
I'm never gonna
play Connect Four with him,
I'll tell you that.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.433
( laughter )

21:50.600 --> 21:52.467
( cheers, applause )

21:52.467 --> 21:54.734
Welcome back
to "SuperHuman"!

21:54.734 --> 21:55.934
( cheers, applause )

21:55.934 --> 21:59.467
A family man
and public relations CEO,

21:59.467 --> 22:02.467
this next superhuman
uses his amazing ability

22:02.467 --> 22:04.300
building robots
in his spare time.

22:04.300 --> 22:06.333
Meet Dave Farrow.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.233
( cheers, applause )

22:10.633 --> 22:11.734
Dave:
 My name's Dave Farrow,

22:11.734 --> 22:14.300
and my superhuman
ability is binary code.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.967
Binary code consists
of ones and zeros,

22:16.967 --> 22:20.633
and that's the basic building
blocks of computer science.

22:20.633 --> 22:22.600
What I'm doing when
I'm memorizing binary code

22:22.600 --> 22:24.734
is turning this
cumbersome information

22:24.734 --> 22:27.600
into something
that I can visualize again,
like an image.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.033
I wanted to get
people excited

22:29.033 --> 22:32.033
about what's behind
every single computer screen.

22:32.033 --> 22:33.166
People don't
know about that,

22:33.166 --> 22:34.600
but if young people
are excited about it

22:34.600 --> 22:36.367
then maybe they'll get
into those careers

22:36.367 --> 22:39.266
and they'll start
to make robots like me.

22:39.266 --> 22:41.400
This is one of
my early prototypes.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.333
You can see
how it works, and--

22:43.333 --> 22:45.633
Oh, I got an idea.

22:45.633 --> 22:46.867
Glad that finger went up.

22:46.867 --> 22:48.000
What I want to say
to anybody out there

22:48.000 --> 22:49.633
is find out
what your passion is

22:49.633 --> 22:51.633
and learn how
to run your brain

22:51.633 --> 22:56.500
and then from that,
you can do absolutely anything.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.934
( cheers, applause )

22:57.934 --> 22:59.166
From Buffalo, New York,

22:59.166 --> 23:01.266
please welcome
Dave Farrow.

23:01.266 --> 23:03.166
( cheers, applause )

23:05.633 --> 23:07.567
- Hey Dave.
- Hey, how you doing?

23:07.567 --> 23:09.900
Good, man.
Welcome to "SuperHuman."

23:09.900 --> 23:11.700
Excited to be here.
This is awesome.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.533
- This is awesome.
- Wow.

23:13.533 --> 23:15.467
( cheers, applause )

23:15.467 --> 23:16.633
Hey, Mike,
I love you, man.

23:16.633 --> 23:18.667
I was actually
an amateur boxer
for a few years.

23:18.667 --> 23:20.367
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

23:20.367 --> 23:22.033
- Awesome.
- I would be honored if
you were to kick my ass.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.000
( laughter )

23:24.000 --> 23:25.767
( cheers, applause )

23:25.767 --> 23:27.266
It's so funny
you say that,

23:27.266 --> 23:29.800
because Doc said when
you came out there shuffling,

23:29.800 --> 23:31.900
I should have
just ran at you
and slugged you.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.233
( laughter )

23:33.233 --> 23:37.400
( cheers, applause )

23:37.400 --> 23:42.166
Your challenge is called
Blown Out Of Proportion.

23:42.166 --> 23:43.166
You're going to see

23:43.166 --> 23:47.333
108 red and blue
balloons.

23:47.333 --> 23:49.367
You'll have to use
your binary skills

23:49.367 --> 23:53.834
to memorize the exact
color and position
of each balloon.

23:53.834 --> 23:55.834
After you've done that,
we'll turn your back
to the grid

23:55.834 --> 23:58.500
and our panelists
will test your ability

23:58.500 --> 24:00.900
to recall the color
of a single balloon

24:00.900 --> 24:03.266
then a column of balloons,

24:03.266 --> 24:06.033
and finally, an entire
row of balloons.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.266
All right, Dave.
We wish you luck.

24:09.266 --> 24:12.100
Please take your position
in the SuperHuman chair.

24:12.100 --> 24:14.000
( cheers, applause )

24:16.500 --> 24:19.900
Please bring out
the 108 balloons.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.900
Oh...

24:21.900 --> 24:25.066
Check it, check it,
check it.

24:25.066 --> 24:26.266
That's gnarly, though.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.700
Dave, your challenge
starts now.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.934
- Okay, I got it.
- You got it?

24:54.934 --> 24:56.533
You ready?
All right.

24:56.533 --> 24:57.734
Let's turn
your chair around.

24:57.734 --> 24:59.700
( cheers, applause )

25:03.300 --> 25:06.233
All right,
this is it, Dave.

25:06.233 --> 25:07.433
First, Dr. Jandial.

25:07.433 --> 25:09.367
What is the position
of the balloon

25:09.367 --> 25:11.066
you would like
Dave to identify?

25:11.066 --> 25:13.900
I'll go with
column four,

25:13.900 --> 25:15.967
row three.

25:15.967 --> 25:18.266
You said column four...

25:19.934 --> 25:21.367
row three.

25:21.367 --> 25:25.700
Dave, please identify
the color of the balloon.

25:25.700 --> 25:26.900
Um...

25:31.367 --> 25:32.500
Should be a red.

25:32.500 --> 25:35.066
- That is correct.
- ( cheers, applause )

25:35.066 --> 25:37.233
Whoo!
That was quick.

25:37.233 --> 25:39.033
Whew!

25:39.033 --> 25:40.166
Christina,
it's your turn.

25:40.166 --> 25:43.166
All right, we're
gonna go with column 15,

25:43.166 --> 25:45.600
from the top
to the bottom.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.967
Column 15,
hold on, hold on.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.166
Make it hard for him.

25:50.166 --> 25:53.300
Penn:
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

25:53.300 --> 25:56.033
Okay, now I'm
at column 15,
so go for it,

25:56.033 --> 25:57.233
from the top
to bottom.

25:58.700 --> 26:00.900
Dave:
First one should
be a blue.

26:00.900 --> 26:02.800
- Yes.
- ( cheers, applause )

26:04.834 --> 26:06.800
The next one
should be a red.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.100
Below that
should be a red
as well.

26:15.567 --> 26:17.500
Next one should be blue.

26:22.233 --> 26:25.667
The next one
should be a red.

26:25.667 --> 26:26.600
Um...

26:28.300 --> 26:31.667
Oh, actually, I think
that's actually a blue.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.533
All right,
and then the last one,

26:47.400 --> 26:48.567
Should be a red.

26:48.567 --> 26:49.734
- Christina: Yeah! 
- That's right!

26:49.734 --> 26:50.734
( cheers, applause )

26:50.734 --> 26:53.433
That's insane, man!

26:53.433 --> 26:55.300
- You got 'em all!
- Awesome.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.834
- Really?
- ( cheers, applause )

26:56.834 --> 26:59.100
Christina: Whoa. Not bad.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.700
Thank you.
Picked that row.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.834
( laughs )

27:01.834 --> 27:03.433
All right, well, we're
saving the best for last.

27:03.433 --> 27:07.467
Mike, please pick a row
for Dave to recall.

27:07.467 --> 27:09.467
Row...

27:10.900 --> 27:12.667
two, right to left.

27:12.667 --> 27:15.900
- Row two, backwards.
- Row two, right to left.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.467
Ooh!

27:17.467 --> 27:18.467
Okay, so...

27:18.467 --> 27:20.467
( exhales )

27:21.867 --> 27:23.367
Row two...

27:23.367 --> 27:25.567
All right,
it should be,

27:25.567 --> 27:26.767
um...

27:29.934 --> 27:30.934
Okay.

27:30.934 --> 27:32.633
All right,
it should be, uh...

27:32.633 --> 27:34.633
blue, red, blue,

27:34.633 --> 27:36.033
red, red, red.

27:36.033 --> 27:37.300
So far, right?

27:37.300 --> 27:38.834
- ( cheers, applause )
- Yeah.

27:38.834 --> 27:40.200
Okay, good.

27:41.433 --> 27:44.033
Okay, so I'll take it
a piece at a time.

27:44.033 --> 27:47.700
It'll be, um,
blue, red, blue.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.133
( exhales )

27:49.133 --> 27:51.100
Okay, okay,
let me get this right.

27:54.233 --> 27:57.967
Red, blue, red.

27:57.967 --> 28:02.000
Then, um...

28:02.000 --> 28:03.600
Be any more confusing.

28:06.433 --> 28:10.100
Then it should be
red, blue, blue,

28:10.100 --> 28:12.333
and red, red, blue.

28:12.333 --> 28:13.333
That's insane!

28:13.333 --> 28:15.233
( cheers, applause )

28:19.066 --> 28:20.900
That was awesome!

28:20.900 --> 28:21.800
Wow!

28:24.700 --> 28:26.000
Dave!

28:30.600 --> 28:32.133
Wow.

28:32.133 --> 28:34.233
Dr. Jandial, you know
the science behind this.

28:34.233 --> 28:35.333
What did you
think of this?

28:35.333 --> 28:37.467
You know,
I'm floored by this.

28:37.467 --> 28:39.400
He's using something
called a binary code

28:39.400 --> 28:40.767
and that's how
computers work.

28:40.767 --> 28:42.233
Somehow he's brought
that into his brain,

28:42.233 --> 28:44.133
where you take information

28:44.133 --> 28:45.934
and you break it
into zeros and ones.

28:45.934 --> 28:47.633
A binary code
works that way.

28:47.633 --> 28:49.433
It's two little switches,
on, off.

28:49.433 --> 28:51.767
You can make
endless computer
programs with it.

28:51.767 --> 28:53.700
Penn: Amazing.

28:53.700 --> 28:56.500
Mike, this was all about
concentration and focus.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.734
You know about that.
How impressed were you
with Dave?

28:58.734 --> 29:01.367
I'm never gonna
play Connect 4 with him,
I tell you that.

29:01.367 --> 29:04.667
( laughter )

29:04.667 --> 29:09.066
Will this be good enough
for Dave to win the title
of SuperHuman?

29:09.066 --> 29:11.633
For now, make
some more noise
for Dave Farrow!

29:11.633 --> 29:13.800
- Thanks, buddy.
- Oh, thank you so much.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.100
Very nice man.
Thank you.

29:15.100 --> 29:18.433
A lot of people say
they never forget a face.

29:18.433 --> 29:21.633
but up next,
an attorney's
stunning ability

29:21.633 --> 29:23.800
to literally
never forget a face

29:23.800 --> 29:25.567
could see him win tonight.
We'll be right back.

29:25.567 --> 29:28.133
( cheers, applause )

29:28.133 --> 29:30.800
You're going
to study 100 faces.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.133
Let's take a look
at you guys.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.633
Three of those people
will be replaced.

29:36.633 --> 29:39.834
Your challenge is to find
the three new faces.

29:39.834 --> 29:40.967
Welcome to the show.

29:40.967 --> 29:42.300
( laughs )

29:50.166 --> 29:52.367
( cheers, applause )

29:52.367 --> 29:54.333
Whoever came up
with the phrase

29:54.333 --> 29:55.667
"I never forget a face"

29:55.667 --> 29:58.166
never met
this next contestant

29:58.166 --> 30:00.400
whose facial
recognition skills

30:00.400 --> 30:02.333
blow past common clichés

30:02.333 --> 30:05.333
and launch him into
a superhuman stratosphere.

30:05.333 --> 30:08.400
You'll never forget
Luke Salava.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.834
( cheers, applause )

30:12.567 --> 30:13.667
Luke:
 My name is Luke Salava,

30:13.667 --> 30:15.233
and my superhuman ability

30:15.233 --> 30:16.934
is that I'm
a super recognizer.

30:16.934 --> 30:20.133
All my life I've found it
easy to recognize people.

30:20.133 --> 30:22.400
Somewhere in
the vaults of my brain

30:22.400 --> 30:23.834
if I've seen your face,

30:23.834 --> 30:25.467
I see your face
again later,

30:25.467 --> 30:28.133
it's just this instant
"Oh, it's so-and-so."

30:29.300 --> 30:31.266
It was only within
the last two years

30:31.266 --> 30:34.800
that I actually
learned that my ability is
a superhuman ability.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.633
One day I was just fooling
around on the Internet,

30:36.633 --> 30:38.934
playing games,
and there was this one
on facial recognition.

30:38.934 --> 30:40.867
At the end of the game,
it told me that I scored better

30:40.867 --> 30:42.433
than nine
out of ten people.

30:42.433 --> 30:45.200
Next thing I know,
there's a Harvard researcher
at my house

30:45.200 --> 30:46.800
giving me
two days of tests

30:46.800 --> 30:48.233
to try to figure out
how I do this.

30:48.233 --> 30:50.767
I'm this
very ordinary guy,

30:50.767 --> 30:54.033
and now, I know that
I'm also a super recognizer.

30:54.033 --> 30:56.967
( cheers, applause )

30:56.967 --> 30:59.700
From Phoenix, Arizona,
please welcome Luke Salava!

30:59.700 --> 31:01.600
( cheers, applause )

31:05.467 --> 31:06.900
Hello, sir!

31:06.900 --> 31:08.867
- Welcome, how you doing?
- Awesome.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.433
- Welcome to "SuperHuman."
- Happy to be here.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.600
Penn:
Okay, Luke.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.000
Your challenge
is called Seat Filler.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.200
Luke, you're going
to study the faces

31:17.200 --> 31:20.000
of 100 members
of our audience.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.200
Then, when you're
not looking,

31:22.200 --> 31:24.533
three of those people
will be replaced

31:24.533 --> 31:26.667
by three new people.

31:26.667 --> 31:29.066
But it gets tougher,
because then,

31:29.066 --> 31:32.767
we're going to make
everybody move around
and change seats.

31:32.767 --> 31:36.667
and your challenge
is to find the three
new faces.

31:36.667 --> 31:38.100
Do you think
you can do this?

31:38.100 --> 31:41.100
I-- I'm gonna say yeah.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.166
I'm very confident,
as you can tell, yeah.

31:43.166 --> 31:46.166
( cheers, applause )

31:46.166 --> 31:49.500
Penn:
Okay, Luke, the section
of the audience you will study

31:49.500 --> 31:51.400
is to your left.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.533
Your challenge
starts now.

31:53.533 --> 31:55.433
( cheers, applause )

32:03.033 --> 32:04.033
Would it be okay
if you actually

32:04.033 --> 32:05.233
turned your
face to me please?

32:05.233 --> 32:06.567
Yeah, thank you.
That helps.

32:06.567 --> 32:08.767
Let's take a look
at you guys.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.667
In this row,
can you face me,
please?

32:27.133 --> 32:28.266
Thank you, everyone,

32:28.266 --> 32:30.367
for allowing me to
stare you in the face.

32:30.367 --> 32:31.934
You're a great-looking
crowd.

32:31.934 --> 32:33.834
( cheers, applause )

32:35.600 --> 32:37.867
Okay, Luke, please
take your position

32:37.867 --> 32:39.767
in the SuperHuman chair,

32:39.767 --> 32:41.600
and then let's turn
the chair around.

32:46.300 --> 32:51.100
Our panelists,
who have now been
turned into ushers...

32:51.100 --> 32:53.567
- ( laughter )
- ...are going to swap out

32:53.567 --> 32:55.734
three members
of the audience

32:55.734 --> 32:59.033
for three new people.

32:59.033 --> 33:01.033
Ooh. Hey!

33:04.133 --> 33:05.133
I got one.

33:05.133 --> 33:06.367
I got one!

33:06.367 --> 33:07.767
I'll pick you.
Come on down.

33:07.767 --> 33:10.233
Penn: Okay, guys,
escort your three people out.

33:10.233 --> 33:13.066
Come on, ma'am.

33:13.066 --> 33:15.667
All right, ushers,
the three people
you're bringing in

33:15.667 --> 33:18.900
should take the empty seats
of the three people
you escorted out.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.000
Yes.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.400
- Thank you, judges.
You can take your seats again.
- See that empty seat.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.133
( cheers, applause )

33:31.567 --> 33:33.333
Okay, now we're
gonna make it tougher.

33:33.333 --> 33:37.667
Audience, would
the rest of you please
all change seats.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.100
Ooh, this gets good.

33:48.166 --> 33:50.667
Okay, please turn
the chair back around.

33:50.667 --> 33:52.567
- Whoo!
- ( cheers, applause )

33:56.934 --> 34:00.233
Luke, of the 100 audience
members you studied,

34:00.233 --> 34:02.600
there are
three new faces.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.333
It's time for you
to go find

34:05.333 --> 34:07.633
those three
new seat fillers.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.699
( cheers, applause )

34:11.699 --> 34:13.467
Sniff 'em out,
Luke!

34:23.632 --> 34:24.934
All right, first,

34:24.934 --> 34:28.199
my friend here in the blue,
with the gray t-shirt.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.600
Could you stand up
for me, please?

34:32.033 --> 34:33.199
Welcome to the show.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.132
( laughter )

34:35.132 --> 34:36.600
Can you stand
by Kal, please?

34:36.600 --> 34:37.667
Thanks.

34:37.667 --> 34:39.766
There's always
the chance I'm wrong.

34:49.033 --> 34:50.433
I'm not so sure
about you.

34:50.433 --> 34:52.400
( laughter )

34:52.400 --> 34:55.367
Could you please
stand as well?

34:55.367 --> 34:59.800
and go on
the not-so-sure side
of Kal, please.

35:23.133 --> 35:25.467
I'm not sure
I recognize you, either.

35:25.467 --> 35:26.900
So would you
also please

35:26.900 --> 35:29.734
go on the not-so-sure
side of Kal for me.

35:37.567 --> 35:39.133
I'm gonna call it.

35:39.133 --> 35:40.533
Penn: All right,
let's see how you did.

35:40.533 --> 35:42.934
Come on down here
and we'll...

35:42.934 --> 35:44.633
We'll ask these folks.

35:44.633 --> 35:46.767
( cheers, applause )

35:46.767 --> 35:50.834
These are the three people
you think were changed.

35:50.834 --> 35:52.500
Let's find out
if you're right.

35:53.633 --> 35:55.300
Are you a new member
of the audience?

35:55.300 --> 35:57.433
- I am.
- Oh!

35:57.433 --> 35:59.300
( cheers, applause )

35:59.300 --> 36:02.266
One for one so far.

36:02.266 --> 36:03.967
Ma'am, are you a new member
of the audience?

36:03.967 --> 36:05.066
Yes.

36:05.066 --> 36:07.133
- ( cheers, applause )
- Two for two!

36:09.233 --> 36:11.333
Sir, are you a new
member of the audience?

36:11.333 --> 36:12.967
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, my God!

36:12.967 --> 36:15.333
( cheers, applause )

36:15.333 --> 36:16.700
How did you do that?

36:16.700 --> 36:18.300
( cheers, applause )

36:18.300 --> 36:21.233
That's crazy!

36:21.233 --> 36:24.500
That's insane, man.
Oh, wow.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.600
Okay, hold on a second.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.734
Dr. Jandial,
how impressive is this?

36:28.734 --> 36:30.734
I can't believe
I just saw this,

36:30.734 --> 36:33.734
because if you talk
to computer programmers,

36:33.734 --> 36:35.000
they'll tell you
facial recognition

36:35.000 --> 36:36.934
is the hardest thing
to do on a computer.

36:36.934 --> 36:39.700
And we do have
an area in our brain
that's responsible for this.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.100
It's called
the fusiform face area,

36:42.100 --> 36:43.500
and it's about
the size of a grape,

36:43.500 --> 36:45.367
but what you have
is remarkable.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.066
I think you could beat
a hundred supercomputers

36:47.066 --> 36:48.734
- with what you
just showed.
- Penn: Wow.

36:48.734 --> 36:50.066
- Thank you.
- Wow.

36:50.066 --> 36:51.800
Listen, I've never seen
anything like that before.

36:51.800 --> 36:53.834
I forget-- I'm gonna forget
everybody I met here.

36:53.834 --> 36:55.667
( laughter )

36:55.667 --> 36:58.500
I'm gonna forget
Christina next day
I see her, you know?

36:58.500 --> 37:00.500
- But no...
- Mike, remember me?

37:00.500 --> 37:02.200
That's why this show
is so important,

37:02.200 --> 37:03.767
because it gives
people like yourself

37:03.767 --> 37:05.533
a stage to show
how wonderful

37:05.533 --> 37:07.300
people are really out here
in this world

37:07.300 --> 37:09.000
and they could do
remarkable things

37:09.000 --> 37:10.200
and that's why
I love this show,

37:10.200 --> 37:11.667
to give you guys
an opportunity
to be seen.

37:11.667 --> 37:13.000
( cheers, applause )

37:13.000 --> 37:15.066
Thank you very much.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.667
Will Luke win tonight?

37:17.667 --> 37:19.900
The panelists
will pick tonight's
top three contestants,

37:19.900 --> 37:24.300
and then from those three,
the audience will
decide who wins.

37:24.300 --> 37:26.233
Right now, let's hear it
for Luke Salava!

37:26.233 --> 37:27.834
Thanks, man.

37:27.834 --> 37:29.734
( cheers, applause )

37:37.633 --> 37:40.600
( cheers, applause )

37:40.600 --> 37:44.166
So, we've seen five
super talented people

37:44.166 --> 37:46.233
demonstrate
their incredible skills,

37:46.233 --> 37:50.367
and one is about
to win $50,000,

37:50.367 --> 37:54.467
and the title
of SuperHuman.

37:54.467 --> 37:57.367
First, our panel
must pick our top three,

37:57.367 --> 38:00.166
so guys, please discuss
what you've seen.

38:01.333 --> 38:02.633
While they make up
their minds,

38:02.633 --> 38:04.767
take another look at
the five extraordinary people

38:04.767 --> 38:05.867
we've seen tonight.

38:09.867 --> 38:11.266
( buzzer blares )

38:13.066 --> 38:16.633
- 535.
- 535! Congratulations!

38:16.633 --> 38:17.934
That's what
I'm talking about!

38:19.567 --> 38:21.600
- Penn: Choir.
- Choir.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.567
All right!

38:22.567 --> 38:23.633
Science club.

38:23.633 --> 38:25.333
Two for two!

38:25.333 --> 38:26.934
Drama class.

38:26.934 --> 38:29.033
"Romeo and Juliet."
You got 'em all!

38:29.033 --> 38:30.667
- ( cheers, applause )
- Got all three!

38:32.266 --> 38:34.133
"Viral."
Oh, boy.

38:34.133 --> 38:35.667
( growls )

38:35.667 --> 38:37.567
"Sonar," "canoe,"

38:37.567 --> 38:40.266
"stamp," "cross."

38:40.266 --> 38:43.500
Five out of five
correct!

38:43.500 --> 38:44.533
( cheers, applause )

38:46.333 --> 38:48.100
Blue, red, blue,

38:48.100 --> 38:49.467
red, red, red.

38:49.467 --> 38:51.333
- Penn: Yeah. 
- Dave: Blue, red, blue.

38:51.333 --> 38:52.600
Red, blue, red.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.400
Okay, okay,
let me get this right.

38:54.400 --> 38:57.166
Red, blue, blue,
red, red, blue.

38:57.166 --> 38:58.233
That's insane!

38:58.233 --> 38:59.233
( cheers, applause )

38:59.233 --> 39:00.867
That was insane, man!

39:03.300 --> 39:04.967
Are you a new member
of the audience?

39:04.967 --> 39:06.667
- I am.
- Oh!

39:06.667 --> 39:07.734
( cheers, applause )

39:07.734 --> 39:09.100
Ma'am, are you a new
member of the audience?

39:09.100 --> 39:10.600
Yes.

39:10.600 --> 39:11.834
Two for two.

39:11.834 --> 39:13.533
Are you a new member
of the audience?

39:13.533 --> 39:16.200
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, my God!

39:19.700 --> 39:22.233
Now, the panelists
are going to reveal

39:22.233 --> 39:24.500
who they've put through

39:24.500 --> 39:26.166
to tonight's top three.

39:29.233 --> 39:31.166
- Mike Tyson.
- Yes.

39:31.166 --> 39:34.400
Who is the first contestant
in the top three?

39:34.400 --> 39:36.233
Tyson:
Man, this is so tough.

39:38.233 --> 39:39.600
But we all decided...

39:43.667 --> 39:45.767
we're gonna go with
the guy from dominos.

39:45.767 --> 39:47.934
- ( cheers, applause )
- Penn: All right!

39:52.533 --> 39:55.767
He set the stage
for all the excitement
that's started tonight,

39:55.767 --> 39:57.400
'cause this is amazing,
all the excitement.

39:57.400 --> 39:58.800
I never saw
this before,

39:58.800 --> 40:01.667
and everybody had to come up
to his level or surpass it,

40:01.667 --> 40:03.400
and it was just
amazing energy here.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.200
- Thank you, man.
- It was just amazing.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.667
( cheers, applause )

40:06.667 --> 40:10.333
All right, Christina.
Who is the panel's next choice

40:10.333 --> 40:11.633
to go into the top three?

40:11.633 --> 40:13.333
Whoo! Okay,
I have to say,

40:13.333 --> 40:16.633
this was probably
the most difficult decision
for all three of us.

40:16.633 --> 40:18.400
Our next pick is...

40:21.100 --> 40:22.433
...Dave Farrow.

40:22.433 --> 40:24.333
( cheers, applause )

40:28.300 --> 40:30.700
You know, it's pretty
awesome what he can do.

40:30.700 --> 40:33.467
And I could not understand
anything that he was doing,

40:33.467 --> 40:34.667
so it's beautiful.
You did it.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.400
- Great job. 
- Thank you so much.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.734
( cheers, applause )

40:37.734 --> 40:40.967
And Dr. Jandial,
on behalf of the panel,

40:40.967 --> 40:43.000
who is taking
the final spot

40:43.000 --> 40:44.633
in the top three?

40:44.633 --> 40:46.834
The last person we chose...

40:49.100 --> 40:51.200
...was Tatiana Marquardt.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.100
( cheers, applause )

40:55.300 --> 40:57.266
Congratulations!

40:57.266 --> 40:59.300
Thanks to our
two remaining contestants.

40:59.300 --> 41:02.467
You were great.
One more time
for Tyler and Luke!

41:03.800 --> 41:06.000
So we have
tonight's top three,

41:06.000 --> 41:08.600
Chris, Tatiana, and Dave.

41:08.600 --> 41:11.233
Now the power passes
to the audience.

41:11.233 --> 41:12.667
This is it.

41:12.667 --> 41:15.867
Audience, you all have
a voting device.

41:15.867 --> 41:18.567
Who is tonight's
SuperHuman?

41:33.300 --> 41:36.734

41:36.734 --> 41:40.500
The audience has voted
and the results are in.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.533
The winner...

41:46.533 --> 41:50.467
of the $50,000...

41:50.467 --> 41:54.834
and the title
of SuperHuman

41:54.834 --> 41:59.200
is...

41:59.200 --> 42:00.500
Dave Farrow!

42:00.500 --> 42:02.400
( cheers, applause )

42:08.533 --> 42:11.100
- Congratulations.
- Oh, man.

42:14.600 --> 42:18.166
Thanks to all of our
super contestants.

42:18.166 --> 42:21.166
Big thanks to Mike Tyson,
Christina Milian,

42:21.166 --> 42:22.834
and Dr. Rahul Jandial,

42:22.834 --> 42:25.700
to our audience,
and to you for watching.

42:25.700 --> 42:28.500
Next week,
more incredible superhumans.

42:28.500 --> 42:30.500
I'm Kal Penn.
Good night, everyone.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.400
( cheers, applause )
