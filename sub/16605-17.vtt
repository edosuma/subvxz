We're in the process

09:33.340 --> 09:36.675

the galaxy.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.443
My challenge
to the Emperor

09:38.445 --> 09:41.179
was a call
to stand against
the Empire.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.515
My hope is,

09:43.517 --> 09:47.052
all who answer it will see
that they are not alone.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.020
I must be there to meet them.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.356
Her involvement
has been a secret,

09:51.358 --> 09:54.626
but the Empire
will be attempting
to track any ship

09:54.628 --> 09:56.628
that tries to leave
this system.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.197

out of the sector.

Senator, we'll get you
to that meeting.

10:02.302 --> 10:05.503
Give them
the coordinates
to Dantooine.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.308
The rebel squadron
defended their transport
vigorously,

10:10.310 --> 10:13.044
but we thwarted
their attempt to refuel.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.213
A scan of the vessel
before it was destroyed

10:15.215 --> 10:18.550
revealed no cargo aboard,
and only a small crew.

10:18.552 --> 10:21.152
Their cargo was
something prized,

10:21.154 --> 10:24.389
a certain Senator,
I suspect.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.224
Senator Mothma?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.993
Her capture
is a priority.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.961
If she escaped
aboard the<i> Ghost,</i>

10:29.963 --> 10:31.262
where is she now?

10:31.264 --> 10:33.164
Not where you'd expect.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.001
Captain Syndulla
will be creative

10:36.003 --> 10:38.169
in avoiding your blockades.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.305
She will brave
the unlikeliest path

10:40.307 --> 10:43.341
to transport her passenger
out of the sector.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.177
There, the
Archeon pass,

10:46.179 --> 10:48.980
a favorite of
Outer Rim smugglers.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.148
Through the nebula?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.584
Our capitol ships
can't follow her.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.019
Precisely.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.789
So I've readied
my new prototype
and our best pilots

10:57.791 --> 11:02.360
to hunt down and capture
this rogue Senator.

11:02.362 --> 11:06.398
Grand Admiral, allow me
the honor of silencing her.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.668
Very well, Governor.

11:09.670 --> 11:13.271
Take Admiral Konstantine to
the far side of the nebula

11:13.273 --> 11:14.873
and wait there.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.209
When our fighters flush
the rebels out into the open,

11:18.211 --> 11:19.210
you'll be in position

11:19.212 --> 11:23.214
to capture
Senator Mon Mothma alive.

11:23.216 --> 11:27.485
She could be
our key to locating
the true rebel fleet.

11:27.487 --> 11:30.255
As you wish,
Grand Admiral.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.236
Sometimes I envy
pilots like you,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.172
traveling through the stars.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.340
You can always
leave your problems
far behind you.

11:49.342 --> 11:52.143
Can't imagine
you running from
your problems.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.713
I've spent my life
in the Senate
trying to do good,

11:54.715 --> 11:57.215
to preserve the rights
of the people.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.084
And we are grateful.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.319
Little good it's done.

12:01.321 --> 12:05.590
The Emperor has crushed
freedom over the years,
bit by bit.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.425
I've opposed him
where I could,

12:07.427 --> 12:12.897
but I've begun to see that
the fight cannot be won
in the Senate.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.433
The stakes are a bit higher
out here on the front lines.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.036
Instead of being outvoted,
you're outgunned.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.370
Life or death.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.673
It's a new experience,
being on the run.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.875
But if that's what
it takes...

12:23.877 --> 12:27.445
Whatever it takes,
this Rebellion
is worth it.
