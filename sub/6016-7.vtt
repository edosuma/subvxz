00:03.578 --> 00:06.411
Ever called someone and were
disappointed when they answered?

00:06.580 --> 00:08.674
You wanted the machine.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.147
You're always thrown off.

00:10.318 --> 00:14.084
You go, "Oh, l... I didn't know
you were there.

00:14.255 --> 00:18.919
I just wanted to leave a message
saying, 'Sorry I missed you."'

00:19.127 --> 00:22.824
So here's two people who hate each
other, don't really ever wanna talk...

00:23.097 --> 00:26.294
...but the phone machine
is like this relationship respirator...

00:26.467 --> 00:29.163
...keeping these marginal,
brain-dead relationships alive.

00:29.337 --> 00:33.899
We do it so when we come home,
you can see the little flashing red light.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.702
You go, "All right, messages."

00:35.877 --> 00:37.868
You see, people need that.

00:38.046 --> 00:41.345
It's very important for human beings
to feel popular and well-liked...

00:41.516 --> 00:43.950
...amongst a large group of people
we don't care for.

00:53.561 --> 00:54.789
Well, this is it.

00:54.963 --> 00:56.624
Oh, this is nice.

00:56.798 --> 00:59.596
- Thanks again for the Chinese food.
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:59.767 --> 01:02.531
- I think I ate too much of that garlic.
- Me too.

01:02.737 --> 01:06.537
I ate the whole plate. I didn't know.
I thought they were peanuts.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.947
You know what, I think Naked Gun
is on. Oh, I've seen it.

01:15.149 --> 01:17.276
I laughed through that whole thing.
Wanna watch?

01:17.452 --> 01:18.851
No.

01:19.187 --> 01:21.712
- I mean, I don't think so.
- I thought you liked to laugh.

01:21.889 --> 01:23.356
I thought you were
happy-go-lucky.

01:23.524 --> 01:28.552
No, no. I'm not happy,
I'm not lucky, and I don't go.

01:28.830 --> 01:30.855
If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.201
That's not funny, Naomi.
I didn't mean to be funny there.

01:35.737 --> 01:39.468
Why don't you check the TV Guide?
I think Holocaust is on.

01:43.411 --> 01:46.938
Jerry, it's George. You all set for the
weekend? This is gonna be great.

01:47.115 --> 01:48.776
You'll have a great time with Naomi.

01:48.950 --> 01:50.747
All right, she's got that laugh.

01:50.918 --> 01:54.251
What'd you say, it's like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

01:54.489 --> 01:56.855
I was thinking we'd take two cars
up to the cabin.

01:57.025 --> 01:59.289
That way, you know, if one of us
wanted to stay...

02:02.330 --> 02:05.128
This thing has never worked right.

02:05.933 --> 02:08.901
You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

02:09.070 --> 02:12.665
Well, first of all, Elmer Fudd
is one of the most beloved...

02:12.840 --> 02:16.173
...internationally known
cartoon characters of all time.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.902
"I'm gonna kill that cwazy wabbit."

02:18.746 --> 02:23.547
Come on! Not only that, a juicer
is one of the healthiest ways...

02:23.718 --> 02:28.348
It makes juice, it extracts the pulp
and... And then the vitamins.

02:28.523 --> 02:32.619
For long life and vitality.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.288
How could you leave
a message like that?

02:36.464 --> 02:38.193
How could you play it to just anyone?

02:38.366 --> 02:39.731
I didn't think you'd leave it.

02:39.901 --> 02:43.132
- I didn't think you'd play it.
- Now she's not coming this weekend.

02:43.304 --> 02:46.137
What do you mean, not going?
We got plans. Call her up.

02:46.307 --> 02:47.899
Ah, it's better anyway.

02:48.076 --> 02:50.169
I mean, really.
What was gonna happen?

02:50.344 --> 02:53.711
I'm a comedian. How can I go out
with a girl with a laugh like that?

02:54.415 --> 02:57.543
It's like Coco Chanel going out
with a fishmonger.

02:59.053 --> 03:03.513
You know, she's with all the perfumes,
and a fishmonger's a pretty bad smell.

03:07.195 --> 03:08.719
Well, maybe you should ask Elaine.

03:08.896 --> 03:11.160
But if I ask Elaine,
Kramer will feel slighted.

03:11.332 --> 03:15.029
Oh, no, no. Don't say anything
to Kramer. Susan can't stand him.

03:15.203 --> 03:17.728
He vomited all over her.

03:19.107 --> 03:21.541
Wait a minute. Do you smell smoke?

03:21.709 --> 03:24.439
- Ah, Kramer.
- Hello, boys.

03:24.612 --> 03:26.273
Top of the morning to you.

03:26.447 --> 03:28.176
What do you say? What do you be?

03:28.616 --> 03:30.743
Put that thing out before you start
another fire.

03:30.918 --> 03:32.408
You had to give him cigars.

03:33.020 --> 03:35.784
So, what are you guys
doing this weekend?

03:36.257 --> 03:38.691
- Ah, we're...
- Because I'm gonna be playing golf...

03:38.860 --> 03:41.454
...at the Westchester Country Club.

03:41.629 --> 03:43.494
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

03:43.664 --> 03:47.395
That's right, buddy.
It's private. It's very private.

03:48.369 --> 03:52.237
I met the pro at the golf shop up on
49th Street. I gave him a Cuban...

03:52.406 --> 03:54.397
...and he invites me for a free round.

03:54.575 --> 03:58.841
Then he says, anytime I lay one of
these on him, it'll be the same deal.

03:59.013 --> 04:00.503
- Wow.
- Isn't that beautiful?

04:00.681 --> 04:03.149
Man, I'm gonna be hitting
the links all weekend.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.487
- Gee, that's... That's too bad.
- Yeah. Too bad.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.951
- Why? What? What?
- Because we were just saying...

04:11.125 --> 04:13.184
...we were gonna ask you
to the country.

04:13.361 --> 04:16.421
Susan's father has a cabin up there,
but all right.

04:16.596 --> 04:18.360
They got any
golf courses up there?

04:18.533 --> 04:20.797
No, no, no.

04:20.968 --> 04:23.232
- No, no, that's pie country.
- Yeah.

04:23.404 --> 04:25.497
Yeah, they do a lot of baking up there.

04:25.673 --> 04:27.868
They sell them by the road.
Blueberry, blackberry.

04:28.042 --> 04:30.237
- Blackberry, boysenberry.
- Boysenberry, huckleberry.

04:30.411 --> 04:32.504
- Raspberry, strawberry.
- Strawberry, cranberry.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.307
Peach.

04:37.852 --> 04:40.184
- I don't know.
- Come on, I don't wanna tag along...

04:40.354 --> 04:42.914
...with George and Susan.
With you, it's a better group.

04:43.357 --> 04:45.723
- What's that?
- Oh, it's an autographed picture...

04:45.893 --> 04:48.987
...for my dry cleaner. I never know
what to write on these things.

04:49.163 --> 04:51.028
I hate doing this.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.999
"I'm very impressed"?

04:57.471 --> 04:59.496
You mean "pressed"
because it's a dry cleaner?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.869
Yeah, see? That's why I hate it.

05:02.043 --> 05:04.034
So come on, you wanna go?

05:04.679 --> 05:08.171
Well, what about the sleeping
arrangements in the cabin?

05:08.583 --> 05:14.385
Well... Same bed,
and underwear and a T-shirt.

05:15.089 --> 05:17.956
- What about me?
- Well, you'd be naked, of course.

05:20.394 --> 05:23.192
- Excuse me. Jerry Seinfeld?
- Yeah.

05:23.364 --> 05:27.095
My names Sanger, Mel Sanger.
I drive that truck out there.

05:27.301 --> 05:29.030
- The Yoo-hoo?
- Yeah.

05:29.203 --> 05:32.036
- I love Yoo-hoo.
- Yes, it's a fine product.

05:32.206 --> 05:34.674
I saw you on The Tonight Show
a couple of weeks ago.

05:34.842 --> 05:37.140
I was watching the show
with my son Donald.

05:37.311 --> 05:40.144
He's got this rare immune deficiency
in his blood.

05:40.314 --> 05:44.148
The damnedest thing. Doctors say
he has to live in a plastic bubble.

05:44.318 --> 05:45.979
Can you imagine that? A bubble.

05:46.153 --> 05:47.882
- A bubble?
- A bubble?

05:48.055 --> 05:49.886
Yes, a bubble.

05:50.191 --> 05:52.557
- Do you mind? May I?
- Oh, sure.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.456
It'd break your heart
seeing him in there.

05:57.632 --> 06:01.591
He's like a prisoner.
No friends. Just his mother and me.

06:01.769 --> 06:04.966
And I'm out there six days
a week hauling Yoo-hoo.

06:05.973 --> 06:09.966
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...

06:10.144 --> 06:12.339
...bubble boy.

06:12.847 --> 06:15.873
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.

06:25.593 --> 06:27.060
Excuse me.

06:27.228 --> 06:29.924
Anyway, we were watching
you on TV...

06:30.097 --> 06:31.564
You get in the bubble with him?

06:31.732 --> 06:33.927
No. He can see through the bubble,
it's plastic.

06:34.101 --> 06:38.060
- Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
- No. It's clear.

06:38.406 --> 06:39.930
Who has the remote?

06:40.107 --> 06:41.540
He does.

06:41.709 --> 06:43.609
The remote goes through the bubble?

06:43.778 --> 06:46.804
Yeah. He's in the bubble
with the remote.

06:46.981 --> 06:49.176
So you have no control
over the remote?

06:49.350 --> 06:51.284
No. It's frustrating.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.444
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.817
So anyway,
you're his favorite comedian.

06:56.991 --> 06:58.652
He laughed so hard the other night...

06:58.826 --> 07:01.056
...we had to give him
an extra shot of hemoglobin.

07:02.363 --> 07:03.796
That's nice.

07:04.031 --> 07:05.658
Tomorrow is his birthday.

07:05.833 --> 07:09.963
And it would mean so much to him
if you could find it in your heart...

07:10.137 --> 07:14.301
...to pay him a visit and just say hello.
- Oh, well, tomorrow, l...

07:14.475 --> 07:18.138
Jerry. Of course he'd pay him a visit.
You'd be happy to.

07:18.612 --> 07:21.012
Yeah. Okay...

07:21.182 --> 07:24.345
Tomorrow. Where do you live?
Uptown? Up Westside?

07:24.785 --> 07:27.583
- No. Upstate.
- Upstate.

07:31.258 --> 07:33.317
He's a bubble boy!

07:34.095 --> 07:37.326
- A bubble boy?
- Yes, a bubble boy.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.763
- What's a bubble boy?
- He lives in a bubble.

07:41.202 --> 07:42.601
Boy.

07:45.573 --> 07:47.700
What kind of a bubble, like an igloo?

07:47.875 --> 07:51.777
No, that's what I thought. It's
a piece of plastic dividing the room.

07:52.613 --> 07:55.810
What kind of plastic do you think it is?
Like that dry-cleaning plastic?

07:55.983 --> 07:57.883
That's no good.

07:58.052 --> 08:00.247
He wouldn't last 10 minutes in there.

08:00.621 --> 08:02.987
What can I do?
I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.

08:03.157 --> 08:05.022
It's his birthday.
I can't go to the cabin.

08:05.192 --> 08:08.525
- Well, where does he live?
- I don't know. Upstate. Fall-something.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.597
Wait a minute. This is right
on the way to the cabin.

08:11.766 --> 08:15.827
Oh, all right. Beautiful. So you stop in,
visit the bubble boy for 20 minutes...

08:16.003 --> 08:17.630
...then we can go.
- You think so?

08:17.805 --> 08:20.706
I know exactly where this is.
You can just follow us.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.036
Oh, great. Okay, we're going away.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.701
- I think I'm excited.
- I'm excited.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.338
Oh, you're gonna love this cabin.
My grandfather built it in 1947.

08:29.517 --> 08:32.918
- It's incredible.
- There you go. It's a '47 cabin.

08:33.254 --> 08:35.950
- So we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

08:36.222 --> 08:38.123
Well, hey.

08:38.359 --> 08:40.486
Very nice. Very nice.

08:41.996 --> 08:43.793
- Well, I'm off to the links.
- Yeah.

08:43.964 --> 08:45.761
I wanna thank you
for the invite upstate.

08:45.933 --> 08:47.161
I'm sorry I can't make it.

08:47.334 --> 08:49.393
- The what?
- Nothing. Let's get going. Come on.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.663
- Did you...?
- No, no, we'll talk about it later.

08:51.839 --> 08:54.637
Is that one of the cigars
my father gave you?

08:58.679 --> 09:01.648
Hey, what's with George and Susan?
Does he actually like her?

09:01.816 --> 09:05.343
I don't know if he likes her
as much as he likes it.

09:05.619 --> 09:07.143
Oh, that's nice.

09:07.321 --> 09:09.380
What's he doing? What is his hurry?

09:09.557 --> 09:12.321
Oh, you know George.
He's gotta make "good time."

09:12.493 --> 09:16.190
He once went from West 81 st St.
to Kennedy airport in 25 minutes.

09:16.363 --> 09:18.092
I never heard the end of it.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.990
Look at him.

09:20.501 --> 09:22.628
Would you stop that, please?
Just stop that.

09:22.803 --> 09:25.897
- Why?
- Knock it off. You're distracting me.

09:26.073 --> 09:28.200
We're making incredible time here.

09:28.375 --> 09:33.335
I once made it to Kennedy airport
from West 81 St. in 15 minutes.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.314
Oh, here. Hold this.
It's $ 10 for the tolls.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.680
What's he doing?
Is he out of his mind?

09:39.053 --> 09:41.681
Do you see him? I don't even
see him anymore. Where is he?

09:42.223 --> 09:44.555
- Isn't that blue car him?
- No, no, that's not him.

09:44.725 --> 09:47.819
What happened to him?
I can't believe it. I lost him.

09:47.995 --> 09:49.485
That stupid idiot.

09:49.663 --> 09:51.961
- Now what are we gonna do?
- It's no big deal, Jerry.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.158
We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

09:54.335 --> 09:56.360
I don't even know
where the bubble boy lives.

09:56.537 --> 09:58.801
I don't even remember the name
of the town.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.498
- You don't have the directions?
- No, I was following him!

10:01.675 --> 10:03.404
How could you not take the directions?

10:03.577 --> 10:05.807
Because he's my directions.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.217
I don't see them, George.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.851
You make plans,
then he goes 100 miles an hour...

10:14.021 --> 10:16.012
...the weekend's over just like that.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.919
Poor little bubble boy.

10:18.092 --> 10:21.584
He's sitting there waiting for you
in his bubble or igloo thing, whatever.

10:21.762 --> 10:24.253
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where I am.

10:24.598 --> 10:27.795
Just get off at this exit.
We'll figure something out.

10:28.903 --> 10:31.667
We lost them. Do you know that?
We lost them.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.067
Well, it's not my fault.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.902
Seinfeld can't drive.
How hard is it to follow somebody?

10:36.076 --> 10:38.135
Well, now what are you gonna do?

10:38.512 --> 10:41.174
It's fine. We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

10:41.949 --> 10:43.507
Does he have the address?

10:50.224 --> 10:52.158
Yeah.

10:57.865 --> 11:00.425
Leave a message,
I'll call you back. Thanks.

11:00.601 --> 11:03.035
Hi, Jerry. It's Naomi.

11:03.204 --> 11:06.332
Listen, if it's not too late,
I changed my mind.

11:06.507 --> 11:09.567
- I'd like to go to the cabin.
- Wait. Wait.

11:09.743 --> 11:12.143
Yeah, hello. Hi.

11:12.446 --> 11:14.073
This is Kramer.

11:14.348 --> 11:16.748
Yeah. I'm the next-door neighbor.

11:17.251 --> 11:21.881
You know, Jerry's left, but listen,
you see, my golf game got canceled.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.887
I'm thinking of going up myself.

11:24.058 --> 11:27.391
They got pies,
and I got the directions right here.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.932
I drive all the way
to the country club...

11:35.102 --> 11:37.627
...and then I find out
there's a tournament going on.

11:38.138 --> 11:40.368
- You mind if I smoke?
- No.

11:40.541 --> 11:42.133
These are Cubans.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.885
I don't know if this is the house.

11:56.056 --> 11:58.422
I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.

11:59.627 --> 12:01.959
Would you stop it?

12:02.129 --> 12:04.654
Would you quit it, please?
Someone is gonna see us here.

12:04.832 --> 12:06.493
So what?

12:06.667 --> 12:09.033
You are such a prude.

12:09.203 --> 12:11.728
Hey. I am not a prude, sweetheart.

12:11.905 --> 12:14.601
I swing with the best of them.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.843
- Come on, let's go in.
- What?

12:17.011 --> 12:20.310
We should tell them what happened.
They might be very late...

12:20.481 --> 12:23.075
...if they make it all.
- I can't go in there.

12:23.484 --> 12:24.951
I can't face the bubble boy.

12:25.452 --> 12:29.718
- What's the matter?
- I don't react well to these situations.

12:30.491 --> 12:33.824
My grandmother died two months early
from how I reacted in the hospital.

12:33.994 --> 12:36.121
She was getting better.
Then I paid her a visit.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.857
She saw my face, boom.
That was the end of her.

12:39.033 --> 12:40.500
- We're going in.
- Wait, please...

12:40.668 --> 12:43.535
- Come on, George. George, stop.
- Would you wait one moment...

12:47.141 --> 12:49.666
I can't believe a little thing
like George speeding...

12:49.843 --> 12:53.074
...and my whole weekend is gone.
The plans, the packing. Everything.

12:53.247 --> 12:55.841
Your whole weekend?
What about the bubble boy?

12:56.016 --> 12:57.881
Why do you keep bringing up
the bubble boy?

12:58.052 --> 13:00.816
You don't have to mention him.
I know about the bubble boy.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.478
I'm aware of the bubble boy.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.716
Why do you keep reminding me
about the bubble boy?

13:09.563 --> 13:12.225
I'll have a cup of coffee
and a turkey club.

13:12.399 --> 13:15.061
- How about you?
- I'll just have a glass of water.

13:17.471 --> 13:18.904
You can't just have water.

13:19.506 --> 13:21.098
Why not? That's all I want.

13:21.275 --> 13:23.743
This isn't a park bench
where you come in and sit down.

13:23.911 --> 13:25.469
It's a business.

13:27.581 --> 13:29.173
Hold it a second.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.908
Don't you play on TV?

13:31.985 --> 13:35.580
- Oh, no.
- Yes. Yes, you saw him on TV.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.082
- What's your name?
- Jerry Seinfeld.

13:38.258 --> 13:41.284
- Elaine...
- Gary Seinfield.

13:41.462 --> 13:43.692
- I saw you on The Tonight Show.
- Right.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.695
Wouldn't you like
an autographed picture?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.995
I don't have any more pictures, Elaine.

13:49.169 --> 13:51.535
He's lying. They're in the trunk.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.538
- Now you get to sign another one.
- I'm not lying.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.608
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

13:57.578 --> 14:00.513
She'll have a cup of coffee
and a broiled chicken.

14:03.951 --> 14:06.317
See, it's not really a bubble.

14:06.520 --> 14:11.389
A lot of people think it's an igloo,
but it's really just a plastic divider.

14:21.769 --> 14:23.464
Can you go in the bubble?

14:23.637 --> 14:26.834
Well, you have to put so many things
on because of the germs.

14:27.007 --> 14:29.737
The gloves, the mask,
it's a whole production.

14:30.711 --> 14:32.008
So then he makes his own bed?

14:32.312 --> 14:35.577
Well, that's one of the things
we fight about.

14:36.683 --> 14:37.911
Would you like to meet him?

14:38.152 --> 14:40.985
- Ah, well, you know...
- Oh, he loves games.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.246
Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit
with him.

14:43.624 --> 14:47.424
Hey, Ma! What the hell do I gotta
do to get some food around here?

14:47.728 --> 14:51.687
I'm starving. And if it's peanut butter,
I'm gonna shove it in your face!

14:59.473 --> 15:03.967
- One picture left in the trunk.
- Thanks. This is fun.

15:04.611 --> 15:06.602
Yeah, this turned out to be
a great weekend.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.338
Where's my water?

15:08.515 --> 15:10.847
Oh, it's coming.

15:11.718 --> 15:13.652
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.816
What'd you write?

15:15.989 --> 15:18.514
"Nothing's finer
than being in your diner."

15:25.165 --> 15:28.191
There is "nothing finer than being
in your diner"?

15:28.368 --> 15:31.360
- No good?
- This is what you came up with?

15:31.538 --> 15:33.028
Well?

15:33.207 --> 15:34.936
That is so lame, Jerry.

15:35.108 --> 15:38.874
People will be reading that for the
next 20 years and laughing at you.

15:39.246 --> 15:42.044
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

15:42.216 --> 15:44.241
Would you mind?
I'd like the picture back.

15:44.418 --> 15:46.852
- Why?
- I'm not happy with what I wrote.

15:47.054 --> 15:49.955
- It's good. I like it.
- No, believe me, it's not good.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.216
I'll mail you one with something
really funny.

15:52.392 --> 15:55.156
Well, when you mail me a new one,
I'll send you back this one.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.661
You don't understand.
I want the picture.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.230
Right.

16:07.641 --> 16:09.472
This is Donald.

16:09.643 --> 16:10.871
- Hi.
- Hello.

16:11.044 --> 16:12.272
Who are you?

16:12.446 --> 16:14.937
- Where's Seinfeld?
- He's on his way.

16:15.115 --> 16:16.605
These are his friends.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.579
What are you looking at?

16:18.752 --> 16:21.346
Never seen a kid in a bubble before?

16:24.658 --> 16:27.286
Of course I have. Come on.

16:27.461 --> 16:30.259
My cousin's in a bubble.

16:31.164 --> 16:34.656
My friend Jeffrey's sister also,
bubble, you know...

16:34.902 --> 16:37.462
I got a lot of bubble experience.
Come on.

16:38.305 --> 16:42.071
- What's your story?
- I have no story.

16:42.242 --> 16:44.369
She works for NBC.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.911
How about taking your top off?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.713
Donald, behave yourself.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.511
Come on.

16:52.686 --> 16:54.381
I know, I know.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.819
Why don't you play
a game of Trivial Pursuit?

16:56.990 --> 16:58.821
Ah, you know, we gotta be running...

16:58.992 --> 17:00.687
What, are you afraid?

17:01.461 --> 17:05.590
- No. You see, it's...
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

17:06.967 --> 17:08.832
I was nice enough
to give you the picture.

17:09.002 --> 17:12.733
I don't like what I wrote. I don't want
it up there. Please just give it back.

17:13.339 --> 17:15.808
You are really starting
to get under my skin.

17:15.976 --> 17:18.637
- I want that picture.
- Well, you can't have it.

17:18.811 --> 17:21.576
In fact, maybe you better
just pay your check, and get out.

17:21.748 --> 17:23.807
I'm not paying until I get that back.

17:23.983 --> 17:25.848
Well, you ain't getting it back.

17:26.019 --> 17:28.783
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.

17:30.190 --> 17:33.091
This chicken is really good.

17:36.063 --> 17:38.361
Okay, history.

17:38.532 --> 17:40.261
This is for the game.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.567
How you doing over there?

17:42.903 --> 17:45.337
Not too good.

17:46.340 --> 17:48.399
All right, bubble boy.

17:48.575 --> 17:50.566
Let's just play.

17:50.744 --> 17:54.043
"Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?"

17:54.214 --> 17:56.307
That's a joke. The Moors.

17:56.483 --> 17:58.576
Oh, no.

17:59.586 --> 18:01.213
I'm so sorry. It's the "Moops."

18:01.388 --> 18:03.583
The correct answer is the Moops.

18:03.757 --> 18:06.783
Moops? Let me see that.

18:08.028 --> 18:10.622
That's not Moops, you jerk.

18:10.797 --> 18:13.061
It's Moors. It's a misprint.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.634
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.

18:18.639 --> 18:23.338
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.
There's no Moops.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.841
- It's Moops.
- Moors.

18:27.247 --> 18:30.273
- Moops.
- Moors!

18:34.287 --> 18:35.777
Hey!

18:36.256 --> 18:37.746
Anybody home?

18:39.626 --> 18:42.493
- Oh, boy.
- What should we do?

18:43.430 --> 18:45.796
Hold these pies.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.324
Okay.

18:58.211 --> 18:59.542
Help. Someone...

18:59.713 --> 19:02.807
- There's no Moops, you idiot!
- Stop it! Let go of him.

19:02.983 --> 19:06.146
Donald. Stop it.
Now, let go of him, Donald.

19:06.319 --> 19:08.913
- I'm gonna kill him.
- He's choking me.

19:09.089 --> 19:10.954
- Donald. Stop.
- Moors!

19:11.124 --> 19:12.523
Say Moors!

19:12.693 --> 19:14.217
Moops. Moops.

19:14.394 --> 19:16.328
Donald, stop it.

19:26.306 --> 19:28.331
What are you doing?
You're choking me. Elaine!

19:28.508 --> 19:31.568
- Are you gonna pay today?
- No, I want that picture back!

19:31.745 --> 19:33.474
Something's happened
to the bubble boy!

19:33.647 --> 19:35.410
- They're rushing him to hospital.
- What?

19:35.582 --> 19:37.880
The bubble boy?
He lives around here?

19:38.051 --> 19:39.484
That's his house, down the road.

19:39.653 --> 19:41.177
He got in a fight with some guy.

19:41.354 --> 19:43.652
Who kind of a person would hurt
the bubble boy?

19:43.824 --> 19:45.951
Some little bald guy from the city.

19:46.126 --> 19:50.460
Come on, Vern. Page, Preston, don't
you think we ought to do something?

19:52.799 --> 19:54.858
Naomi, come on, let's get going.

19:55.035 --> 19:57.003
But that lake must be freezing.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.797
No, it's good for you.

19:58.972 --> 20:01.065
Retards the aging process.

20:05.912 --> 20:08.005
Ready to go swimming?

20:08.181 --> 20:09.580
Let's go.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.978
Okay.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.690
Jerry, what happened to you?

20:21.862 --> 20:24.296
What happened to you?
You were going 100 miles an hour.

20:24.464 --> 20:26.193
I was not.
Bubble boy tried to kill me.

20:26.366 --> 20:27.958
- What?
- Susan, tell them.

20:28.135 --> 20:30.399
It's a long story.

20:31.338 --> 20:34.068
- Hey, Seinfeld.
- Hey, happy birthday.

20:34.241 --> 20:35.640
Thanks for showing up.

20:35.809 --> 20:38.505
- You know, your friend tried to kill me.
- He's a lying snot.

20:38.678 --> 20:40.612
He's a cheater, aren't you,
little twerp?

20:40.781 --> 20:42.112
- Moors!
- Moops!

20:42.349 --> 20:44.317
- Moors!
- Moops!

20:44.484 --> 20:47.885
There's the guy who tried to kill
the bubble boy. Get him!

20:57.497 --> 20:59.488
Fire engines.

21:02.435 --> 21:04.426
Must be a big one.

21:07.941 --> 21:09.909
Do you smell something?

21:10.143 --> 21:11.667
- Yeah.
- Smoke.

21:11.845 --> 21:13.972
Yeah. Definite smoke.

21:14.948 --> 21:16.643
Look, it's a fire!

21:17.050 --> 21:19.484
Holy cow, look at that!

21:19.753 --> 21:23.245
- It's my father's cabin!
- The cabin is on fire.

21:24.858 --> 21:29.261
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.

21:31.097 --> 21:33.258
How could this have happened?

21:36.603 --> 21:37.934
Oh, my God. The cabin.

21:38.104 --> 21:39.469
What are you two doing here?

21:39.639 --> 21:41.163
Look at that.

21:42.976 --> 21:44.568
Hey, you didn't:

21:45.579 --> 21:47.479
My Cubans.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.883
Something very scary
and exciting about fire.

21:53.053 --> 21:54.520
People always run to see a fire.

21:54.688 --> 21:57.521
They're very proud
if they have a fireplace.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.057
I think that's what smoking
is really all about.

22:00.227 --> 22:02.491
That's the power of smoking.
It's just this thing:

22:02.662 --> 22:05.028
"I got fire right here in my hand.

22:05.365 --> 22:09.131
Smoke and fire is literally
coming right out of my mouth."

22:09.302 --> 22:11.361
And it's very intimidating
to the nonsmoker.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.062
It's like talking to someone going:

22:13.240 --> 22:15.299
"My head could open up.
Lava could explode out.

22:15.475 --> 22:18.501
Pour right down my face.
Doesn't bother me a bit."

22:19.212 --> 22:20.645
And a cigar is even worse.

22:20.814 --> 22:22.338
I mean, a cigar is like:

22:22.515 --> 22:27.043
You think this end is bad.
Look at this wet, disgusting nub, huh?

22:27.220 --> 22:29.620
How scary is that?
