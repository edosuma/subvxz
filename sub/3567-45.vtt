<i> ~ Fora Temer ~</i>

00:28.880 --> 00:31.298
This place is even
bigger and more weapony

00:31.415 --> 00:33.917
- than I remember.
- This was the site of

00:33.968 --> 00:36.853
a historic battle.
Every weapon here was left by

00:36.921 --> 00:40.173
a gem over 5,000 years ago.
I don't like to disturb it, but

00:40.258 --> 00:43.409
Garnet said we can't just
leave these lying around.

00:44.262 --> 00:46.596
Garnet: Never know when you
might need one of these.

00:46.731 --> 00:48.598
I need one of those all the time!

00:48.733 --> 00:52.018
Why don't you look for
one that's more... You?

00:52.103 --> 00:55.272
Okay!
Lion, come help me look!

00:55.323 --> 00:57.824
- Aww, come on!
- You really need

00:57.909 --> 01:00.968
- to train that thing better.
- Oh, we've been making progress.

01:01.003 --> 01:03.863
Now he looks at me when I say
his name! Lion!

01:03.948 --> 01:08.118
<i>Lion! Hey, lion!
Lion!</i>

01:08.202 --> 01:11.705
<i>Lion! Lion!</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:17.777
- Uh, sometimes.
- What's he got now?

01:18.613 --> 01:22.449
That's the scabbard for Rose's sword!
Grr! Gimme!

01:22.650 --> 01:24.601
Gimme!
Shoo. Shoo.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.936
Mom fought here?

01:27.021 --> 01:29.355
That's right, and I
fought alongside her.

01:29.440 --> 01:31.574
Man, I wish I could have seen it.

01:31.659 --> 01:34.527
No, you don't.
Countless gems were broken here.

01:34.612 --> 01:36.996
It was a maelstrom of
destruction and death.

01:37.081 --> 01:40.950
But we won!
Your mother led us to

01:41.001 --> 01:43.536
glorious victory.
The odds were against us, and

01:43.621 --> 01:47.540
our hearts were uncertain, but
we chose to fight alongside

01:47.625 --> 01:52.629
Rose, and here we made our
stand against our homeworld!

01:53.981 --> 01:58.134
This is great!
My room's been needing another pile!

01:58.185 --> 02:00.520
Amethyst, help me with this ax.

02:00.604 --> 02:04.641
- Oh, it's been ages.
- Turn it clockwise!

02:04.692 --> 02:07.844
- No, your other clockwise!
- Wh-what is it, Steven?

02:07.945 --> 02:10.545
What was Mom like?

02:10.614 --> 02:14.117
She was courageous
and brilliant and...

02:14.184 --> 02:17.987
- beautiful. Sometimes you
- Yeah, let's try backwards...

02:18.038 --> 02:19.455
- look so much like her.
- Really?

02:19.490 --> 02:22.625
- You mean "pull."
- Yeah, yeah, pull.

02:22.710 --> 02:26.412
- Sure. Yah!
- Hey, Steven...

02:26.497 --> 02:28.381
Maybe you should hold on to this.

02:28.465 --> 02:32.168
Whoa! Thanks, Pearl!
If anything tries to eat me,

02:32.252 --> 02:35.627
- I'll bop 'em with this!
- That's just the scabbard, Steven.

02:35.662 --> 02:37.507
It held your mother's sword.

02:37.558 --> 02:40.977
Nothing else could fit
so perfectly inside.

02:41.011 --> 02:45.181
- For all this time, it's been incomplete.
- Well, let's complete it.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.483
- Where's the sword?
- That's it!

02:47.518 --> 02:51.104
Yeah-ah! Ha!
You got it!

02:51.188 --> 02:53.906
- Can you keep a secret?
- A secret?!

02:53.991 --> 02:56.442
Shh!
It's a secret, even to Garnet

02:56.527 --> 02:59.195
and Amethyst.
Rose had a place that she kept

02:59.246 --> 03:01.364
hidden from all but me.

03:01.415 --> 03:05.034
But you have her gem.
That place is yours now,

03:05.085 --> 03:08.121
- and I can show it to you.
- Uh, okay.

03:08.205 --> 03:11.958
Now, it's just a 3-hour
hike that way, followed

03:12.042 --> 03:14.377
<i>by a vertical climb at 90 degrees.</i>

03:14.461 --> 03:17.380
<i>Think you can handle it?</i>

03:17.464 --> 03:20.350
I was your mother's sole confidant.

03:20.384 --> 03:23.243
For the words she could share
with no one else,

03:23.347 --> 03:26.389
- I was there to listen.
- Why'd she keep so

03:26.523 --> 03:29.058
- many secrets?
- She had to, Steven!

03:29.109 --> 03:32.395
It's the mark of a great leader ...
knowing just what to

03:32.446 --> 03:35.531
keep hidden from everyone
you're trying to protect ...

03:35.616 --> 03:37.567
everyone except me.

03:38.451 --> 03:44.207
- Welcome to Rose's secret armory.
- Whoa!

03:44.241 --> 03:46.409
- I've been here before!
- What?

03:46.493 --> 03:49.078
Uh, you must be thinking
of someplace else.

03:49.163 --> 03:52.248
I'm the only other Crystal Gem
who's ever witnessed

03:52.299 --> 03:54.250
the armory's magnificence
before now.

03:54.385 --> 03:56.419
Nuh-unh!
Lion showed me.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.922
- The lion?!
- Yeah!

04:00.057 --> 04:03.843
There's all kinds of
great stuff hidden in here.

04:03.927 --> 04:07.146
I know!
That's why I brought you here!

04:07.231 --> 04:10.902
Now let me show you how you
can access the artillery.

04:10.937 --> 04:13.352
That's okay.
I can do it without you.

04:13.437 --> 04:14.437
Wham!

04:17.991 --> 04:21.877
Oh, right. Uhm!

04:22.496 --> 04:27.116
- We got some... axes!
- The axes of ages?

04:27.201 --> 04:30.119
Ooh!
We got spiky chain lady

04:30.170 --> 04:32.922
- and her metal dealies.
- The heretic's anguish!

04:32.956 --> 04:35.262
We got a ...
ooh-ooh! ...

04:35.305 --> 04:39.462
- 3-pack of laser light cannons!
- The quartizine trio!

04:39.596 --> 04:43.736
Boop! And...
a whole lot of these armor guys!

04:43.771 --> 04:48.524
- The armor of the fallen!
- What were we looking for?

04:48.559 --> 04:49.972
Her sword!

04:50.057 --> 04:53.609
Your mother's sword!
It's a straight-bladed saber

04:53.644 --> 04:57.280
that's pink with a red handle.
There are vines etched in the

04:57.314 --> 04:59.282
guard that connect to
a rose-shaped pommel.

04:59.316 --> 05:03.686
- Ohh! I know where that is!
- Huh?

05:04.856 --> 05:05.988
♪ Da-da da-da da-da ♪

05:06.039 --> 05:08.091
♪ da-da da-da da-da
da-da da-da da ♪

05:08.192 --> 05:11.861
- # here it is! #
- Rose's sword ...

05:11.929 --> 05:14.597
- How did it get in there?
- I don't know, but

05:14.665 --> 05:17.533
there's a ton of stuff in there.
I keep stuff in him, too.

05:17.601 --> 05:20.870
Huh! Hup!

05:23.329 --> 05:24.507
Ta-da!

05:24.591 --> 05:26.976
But... how?

05:27.010 --> 05:30.480
Does lion have something

05:30.514 --> 05:34.819
- to do with Rose?
- Ohh! Of course!

05:34.854 --> 05:37.860
- That's why he's pink!
- It's a little obvious.

05:37.895 --> 05:41.574
- But Rose didn't have a lion.
- It seems like her

05:41.658 --> 05:44.193
- stuff in there.
- No! Rose didn't have

05:44.278 --> 05:46.863
a lion, because if Rose had
a lion, I would have

05:46.947 --> 05:49.520
- known about it!
- Rose kept many things secret,

05:49.555 --> 05:52.301
- even from us.
- But not from me!

05:52.369 --> 05:54.537
I was the one she told everything!

05:54.605 --> 05:57.039
Yo, you're not
the only one who misses her!

05:57.107 --> 06:00.176
You can't understand how I feel!

06:00.244 --> 06:03.412
- None of you had what we had!
- She probably just

06:03.480 --> 06:05.281
wanted to protect you,
like everyone else.

06:05.349 --> 06:09.727
What do you know?!
You've never even met her!

06:13.249 --> 06:15.525
<i>Hup!</i>

06:15.592 --> 06:18.277
Fine! Go!

06:18.395 --> 06:22.298
- Go cry about it!
- Where'd she go?

06:22.399 --> 06:25.875
Who cares?
I hate it when she gets like this!

06:25.910 --> 06:30.779
Garnet?
Is she okay?

06:32.318 --> 06:34.680
Well, I'm gonna go find her.

06:34.715 --> 06:38.314
Do you know where she went?

06:38.382 --> 06:40.483
I'm going to assume
that means you do.

06:41.404 --> 06:44.052
Let's go find Pearl!

06:46.340 --> 06:49.425
Good luck.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.261
<i>Pearl?!</i>

06:52.346 --> 06:55.264
Leave me alone!

06:55.399 --> 06:58.327
Huh? Hmm!

06:58.652 --> 07:01.020
Pearl! Wait for me!

07:05.108 --> 07:09.443
Get that thing away from me!

07:09.478 --> 07:12.639
You better sit
this one out, lion.

07:18.119 --> 07:21.874
Okay! I had a talk with lion!
He's gonna ...

07:21.959 --> 07:25.177
chill out here!
We're alone now ...

07:25.295 --> 07:27.853
nice and private!

07:33.053 --> 07:36.289
<i>Uh, good idea!
I'll meet you at the top!</i>

07:39.977 --> 07:43.059
Th-This is really
hard to do in sandals!

07:43.494 --> 07:45.364
<i>Go away!</i>

07:45.449 --> 07:49.738
Pearl! Did I ...
Did I do something wrong?!

07:49.773 --> 07:52.127
You got to tell me!

08:02.699 --> 08:05.131
Steven!

08:25.728 --> 08:29.692
Pearl!
Pearl, you have to tell me

08:29.726 --> 08:33.562
- what's wrong.
- Sometimes...

08:33.647 --> 08:36.573
you even sound like her.

08:36.927 --> 08:42.238
Do you remember this place?
Do you have any of her memories?

08:42.239 --> 08:49.915
We were right here, over
5,000 years ago.

08:52.979 --> 08:55.050
- Pearl...
- Yes?

08:55.135 --> 08:58.304
...I'm going to stay and
fight for this planet.

08:58.388 --> 09:01.017
You don't have to do this with me.

09:01.052 --> 09:04.093
- But I want to!
- I know you do.

09:04.177 --> 09:09.431
Please, please understand ...
if we lose, we'll be killed,

09:09.482 --> 09:12.484
and if we win,
we can never go home.

09:12.485 --> 09:17.105
Why would I ever want
to go home if you're here?

09:22.078 --> 09:27.116
- My Pearl.
- You're wonderful.

09:31.418 --> 09:36.091
Everything I ever did, I did for her.
Now she's gone...

09:36.176 --> 09:42.431
but I'm still here.
Sometimes I wonder

09:42.465 --> 09:46.184
if she can see me through
your eyes.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.697
What would she think of me now?

09:54.144 --> 09:58.264
Well, I think
you're pretty great.
