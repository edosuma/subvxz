        getting smashed.

     I just see a whole lot
   of [bleep] anger right now.

34:22.795 --> 34:26.330
  Narrator: As the pile of dead
    crab continues to rise...

34:30.135 --> 34:32.768
They need to get it out
of the [bleep] tank, though.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.504

34:34.505 --> 34:36.840

the [bleep] out of there.

      you guys what to do,

35:33.799 --> 35:36.165
    I started as a processor.

35:36.167 --> 35:39.002

       And they're family.

35:45.978 --> 35:47.945
    So I'm going to be damned

35:47.947 --> 35:50.380
    if some [bleep] new guy's
      going to go and yell

35:50.382 --> 35:54.051
         at people that
   I've known longer than him.

36:03.428 --> 36:04.661
          I don't know.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.065

        on his dead loss.

 You know, it's a lot of money.
          I don't know.

       taking it out on me

          I was there.

      was going to be bad.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.413
  I knew it was going to be the
 exact opposite of good and fun.

a year since I've done it.
