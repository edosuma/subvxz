WEBVTT

00:48.591 --> 00:51.051
-Well, that's fine.
-Come on.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.179
-Darn it.
-But still…

00:53.262 --> 00:56.098
JOBS WANTED

00:58.809 --> 01:00.269
How old are you?

01:01.187 --> 01:02.688
-Excuse me?
-Let's have a drink.

01:02.772 --> 01:04.690
Gosh! Why are you doing this?

01:05.316 --> 01:08.736
-You can't be doing this.
-What did we do?

01:08.819 --> 01:11.238
I'll buy everything.
Just tell me how much.

01:11.322 --> 01:14.617
-What are you all looking at me for?
-Please let go!

01:14.700 --> 01:17.036
Mind your own business, all right?

01:18.496 --> 01:20.206
What are you all looking at?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.794
Is this entertaining?

01:24.877 --> 01:29.298
I was released from juvie two days ago,
so I couldn't afford to get into trouble.

01:33.344 --> 01:35.221
Let me borrow this umbrella.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.390
Please stop and return to your seats.

01:40.810 --> 01:42.728
What's up with this girl?

01:42.812 --> 01:45.397
Have you lost your mind?
Do you have a death wish?

01:45.481 --> 01:48.359
-My goodness.
-Gosh, I hope she'll be okay.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.116
-This is going to hurt.
-Go ahead.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.911
-Go on, hit me.
-"This is going to hurt"?

01:58.994 --> 02:01.914
Make sure you get hit properly,
or else it'll tickle.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.625
You little punk. She said it'll hurt.
You better watch out.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.293
My gosh.

02:06.377 --> 02:08.254
-Who the hell are you?
-Using the bathroom.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.589
Then get the fuck out of my way.

02:10.673 --> 02:12.550
-It's all right, sir.
-Go ahead, hit me.

02:12.633 --> 02:15.594
-I told you to move, you punk.
-Go on and hit me.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.514
-What the hell is he doing?
-I have no idea.

02:18.597 --> 02:19.974
Hey schoolgirl, get them!

02:31.986 --> 02:33.445
You shit!

02:51.630 --> 02:53.132
You bastard--

03:00.764 --> 03:02.224
-Come here!
-Come here!

03:05.728 --> 03:07.354
Hey, get out of here.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.899
Hurry up. Get lost. Move it.

03:11.442 --> 03:14.194
They threw the first punch.
We're the victims here!

03:14.278 --> 03:16.113
That's not something to brag about.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.574
You should be ashamed
of those tattoos on your arm.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.627
Hey, schoolgirl.
You think this is mutual combat?

03:30.419 --> 03:33.380
Wait. Is this your first offense?
Do you not know what that is?

03:33.464 --> 03:36.342
How is this mutual?
They are the ones who started it.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.427
Gosh, but you…

03:39.845 --> 03:41.639
hit them too hard.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.349
Park Joon-gyeong!

03:47.227 --> 03:48.979
What are you doing in there?

03:50.147 --> 03:51.607
Hello. What brings you here?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.777
I'm Park Joon-gyeong's guardian.

03:58.697 --> 04:01.533
You must be Yoon Hye-rin,
the CEO of Bluenet.

04:01.617 --> 04:04.036
I was told you'd be coming.
Please come this way.

04:05.537 --> 04:10.626
DEFENDANT PARK JOON-GYEONG
GUARDIAN YOON HYE-RIN

04:12.294 --> 04:14.588
The statements of the victims
and passengers corroborate,

04:14.672 --> 04:18.092
and the victims have quite a record,
so there won't be any big issues.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.346
Is this the kid
who fought alongside Joon-gyeong?

04:22.930 --> 04:26.350
Yes. He was in a juvenile center before
and doesn't have a guardian.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.978
So we'll have to question him some more.

04:30.980 --> 04:35.275
Well, then, the investigation of this case
isn't quite over yet, is it?

04:36.110 --> 04:37.903
Well, Joon-gyeong is free to go.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.241
Joon-gyeong,

04:42.324 --> 04:45.911
you go back in there
and tell him to come out for questioning.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.037
Excuse me?

04:47.746 --> 04:51.417
He fought alongside her, so I'll join
the questioning as his guardian.

04:53.002 --> 04:55.713
Hey, your name is-- Oh, right.

04:56.588 --> 04:57.673
Eun Yong.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.467
Come out here. It's your turn now.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.178
-Excuse me, ma'am. Actually--
-What are you doing?

05:04.013 --> 05:05.973
Go back in and tell him to come out.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.434
Ma'am,
we'll take care of that punk oursel--

05:08.517 --> 05:10.185
Hey, where are you going?

05:10.269 --> 05:11.270
Hey.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.399
-Open the cell for me.
-Why would you come back inside?

05:16.734 --> 05:19.611
Ma'am, you're making this difficult.
It's late as well.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.530
I'm used to working late hours.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.491
I'll stay here until the end
as his guardian.

05:25.743 --> 05:29.705
-That's not the problem here.
-I'm telling you I'll be his guardian.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.915
Why is that a problem?

05:34.668 --> 05:37.129
Can you please not make this
difficult for us?

05:37.212 --> 05:40.132
Park Joon-gyeong's questioning is over,
so go home with your daughter.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.925
That's not true.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.054
It's not over until our teammate,
that boy, is finished with questioning.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.307
I looked over the report,

05:48.390 --> 05:51.685
and it appeared as if minors need
their guardians to sign off on things.

05:51.769 --> 05:53.854
I'll be that guardian.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.453
All right. Have some of this.

06:10.162 --> 06:13.082
Eating tofu prevents you
from going back to jail.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.712
The pajamas fit well.
It's what her dad used to wear.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.632
Ma'am,

06:22.299 --> 06:25.094
I'm an ex-con
who was released from juvie two days ago.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.262
Are you okay
with bringing me into your home?

06:27.346 --> 06:29.306
You don't even know who I am.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.849
You are on our team.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.560
I signed off as your guardian.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.605
I heated up the study,
so you can sleep there.

06:36.688 --> 06:39.066
I'll clean the room up for you.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.235
You don't have to. I'll do it.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.278
Will you do that for me?

07:06.885 --> 07:10.514
I guess the smart kids
all have one of these.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.391
What are you doing?

07:13.016 --> 07:14.893
Don't touch anything and go to bed.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.909
You're going to study here?

07:30.993 --> 07:32.870
I'm here to keep my eyes on you.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.252
If you try to do anything funny,

07:41.670 --> 07:43.172
I'll kill you.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.221
What about your father?

07:56.977 --> 07:58.687
I don't have any parents.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.774
Your mom must feel relieved
to have such a good fighter as a daughter.

08:04.109 --> 08:05.402
I'll sleep fine.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.824
I'm used to sleeping
with people around anyway.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.364
That was the first time

08:51.573 --> 08:53.283
I'd ever had a good night's sleep.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.787
Pajamas you can only see on TV.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.874
When I woke up,

09:01.500 --> 09:04.211
I had an unfamiliar feeling
that I was in paradise.

09:05.671 --> 09:06.672
CERTIFICATE

09:08.006 --> 09:09.007
FIRST PLACE

09:13.679 --> 09:14.846
You're awake.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.809
Are you hungry? Let's eat breakfast.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.439
I didn't make much.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.526
Joon-gyeong went to school,
and I have to go to work soon.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.279
Thank you for the food.

09:40.706 --> 09:45.043
Your daughter seemed like she's at the top
of the class and a perfect student.

09:45.127 --> 09:48.505
-Why didn't you scold her?
-She stood up for a cause. Why would I?

09:51.174 --> 09:54.678
Why did you end up
in a juvenile detention center?

09:56.680 --> 10:00.392
I robbed a bank.
I took about one billion won.

10:01.852 --> 10:04.771
I never imagined I'd be
cooking breakfast for a bank robber.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.691
Oh, the soup. I totally forgot.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.116
Smells salty.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.952
Let's just eat it.

10:28.128 --> 10:33.342
If the reason you commit crime is
because it's your livelihood, then stop.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.804
I run a company.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.808
If you want to work,
I can find you a job at the factory.

10:44.019 --> 10:47.105
-Does it pay well?
-Depends on how much you work.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.193
Can I keep this business card?

10:51.777 --> 10:55.947
What's the purpose of a business card
if I'm going to ask for it back?

11:03.330 --> 11:04.664
Salty, right?

11:05.499 --> 11:06.833
That's how soup should be.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.760
I hope I see you often.

11:18.887 --> 11:19.971
Sure.

11:21.306 --> 11:25.310
She was the first grown-up
who treated me like a human being.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.663
BLUENET CEO ARRESTED FOR BRIBERY

12:15.610 --> 12:16.778
PARK JOON-GYEONG

12:16.862 --> 12:19.156
CALL ME WHEN YOU READ THIS

12:22.451 --> 12:24.327
My mom is in trouble.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.705
Please give me a call
when you see this email.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.642
-Hello?
-It's a night flight. How's the weather?

12:47.726 --> 12:48.768
It's fine.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.772
I think Major Park Joon-gyeong
is the anonymous informant, like you said.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.400
The Special Investigations department
is in charge of the case.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.569
That's why she can't be reached.

12:57.652 --> 13:01.490
-The Special Investigations department?
-I'll brief you more when you arrive.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.868
You should get some sleep.
I'm sure you must be exhausted.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.625
No. It's too late to get any sleep anyway.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.673
I saw that Special Investigations
was in charge of CEO Yoon's case.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.176
Is her case connected to Chairman Myung's?

13:24.262 --> 13:27.098
CEO Yoon was arrested
without a warrant because…

13:29.768 --> 13:32.187
This is a copy of Minister Son's
secretary's work diary.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.440
You see what's written on there?
"Bluenet Yoon, 5,000"?

13:36.900 --> 13:40.278
I do see it. But what is this?

13:41.780 --> 13:43.949
I think you know better than I do.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.116
I mean, gosh.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.871
I've never given him this money.

13:49.955 --> 13:52.624
As of now,
you are not a witness but a suspect.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.878
She was accused of bribing
Minister Son Seung-jun,

13:56.962 --> 13:59.756
her college friend,
by giving him over $50,000.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.343
The person who conducted the investigation
was Hwang Gi-seok,

14:04.010 --> 14:05.595
Myung's son-in-law.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.473
Chairman Myung's son-in-law?

14:08.557 --> 14:12.686
He's infamous for cooking up stories,
whatever the ingredient may be.

14:13.228 --> 14:15.480
Within the prosecution,
people call him Chef Hwang.

14:16.690 --> 14:21.194
He's an elite, and many expect him
to become the future attorney general.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.199
Then what he really wanted
was probably Minister Son.

14:26.283 --> 14:29.578
You're right.
Chef Hwang eventually got him.

14:29.661 --> 14:32.872
Minister Son, who had the most support
as a candidate for governor,

14:32.956 --> 14:35.542
had to withdraw his candidacy
due to bribery charges.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.546
But CEO Yoon was acquitted
in the first trial.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.716
The investigation fizzled out
after Son stepped down.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.595
Then why?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.888
Are you sure it was a suicide?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.270
I just sent you a video. Watch it.

15:17.042 --> 15:20.337
I can't think of any other explanation
besides suicide.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.133
The case was closed as a suicide
due to depression from the investigation.

15:26.509 --> 15:27.677
That can't be right.

15:29.179 --> 15:30.764
She'd never do this.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.950
I knew you'd be the strongest fighter.

15:52.202 --> 15:55.455
Let's work under Seong-tae for a bit
and form our own gang.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.916
You be the boss,
and I'll be your right-hand man.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.001
Right-hand man, my foot.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.879
We'll buy a fancy jacket from Italy
and go to a bar and drink.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.383
We will even drink coffee at a hotel.
Why? You don't want that?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.927
Let me have a think, you punk.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.720
You be quiet.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.390
Come on. I'll make it happen.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.065
You got a girlfriend recently or what?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.027
How can you leave me out?

16:28.613 --> 16:29.948
What are these flowers for?

16:31.449 --> 16:33.243
They were on sale, so…

16:34.953 --> 16:36.246
They're roses.

16:36.329 --> 16:39.416
I've never bought flowers before,
so I got a bunch.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.836
Buy me a bunch often, okay?

16:42.919 --> 16:45.338
Yes. I'll make sure to do that.

16:46.464 --> 16:50.385
-Come on in and eat.
-Sure. What's on the menu today?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.326
Even back when I worked as a thug…

17:18.121 --> 17:20.582
Happy birthday to you

17:20.665 --> 17:23.168
Happy birthday to you

17:23.251 --> 17:25.628
Happy birthday, dear Mom

17:25.712 --> 17:28.047
Happy birthday to you

17:31.217 --> 17:33.261
Blow the candles out!

17:42.103 --> 17:44.814
Even when I was working
for the loan sharks…

18:11.382 --> 18:14.052
she was a silver lining to me,
who was living in a world

18:15.303 --> 18:17.138
where only the strongest survived.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.732
I liked her with all my heart.

18:29.943 --> 18:34.197
She was the first grown-up
to ever treat me like a human being.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.908
She was a respectable woman.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.619
I don't understand.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.832
She would never do something like this.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.584
What can you do
even if you find out the real reason?

18:48.753 --> 18:49.796
Vengeance?

18:50.421 --> 18:53.424
It's not like that's going to
bring back the dead.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.388
With Hwang Gi-seok in his family,

18:59.222 --> 19:01.808
Myung is no longer just a loan shark.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.770
If you think about it,

19:05.854 --> 19:09.941
taking revenge on someone is too risky
compared to the reward.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.735
You should always pay back what you owe.

19:13.987 --> 19:16.906
Don't weigh your losses but your values.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.077
That's what Ms. Yoon did for me.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.595
MAN IGNITES HIMSELF
AT BOOK LAUNCH

19:38.678 --> 19:41.389
SOLAR BIO STOCK MANIPULATION -
WHAT IS PROSECUTION HIDING?

19:41.472 --> 19:44.809
OH CHANG-HYEON, CEO OF GMI BANK,
FORMER SEOUL DISTRICT ATTORNEY

19:46.144 --> 19:49.105
GMI BANK BEHIND YEOUIDO RAMBO?

19:58.615 --> 20:00.158
NO ROAD FROM HERE
NO TRESPASSING

20:20.970 --> 20:22.805
HWANG GI-SEOK, CHIEF PROSECUTOR
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS

20:22.889 --> 20:25.266
MYUNG IN-JU
CHAIRMAN OF MYUNGIN HOLDINGS

20:26.601 --> 20:28.353
Oh, shit!

20:28.978 --> 20:29.979
What do we do?

20:30.063 --> 20:31.064
SOLAR BIO VICTIM, SUICIDE

20:31.147 --> 20:32.774
Who will be held accountable for this?

20:33.274 --> 20:38.196
Chief Prosecutor, why are you all riled up
over a commie newspaper?

20:38.279 --> 20:40.406
What nonsense are you talking about?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.742
Director Kim, you son of a bitch.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.077
KIM SEONG-TAE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GMI BANK

20:44.160 --> 20:47.789
You couldn't even take care of
a Rambo thug and let this blow up?

20:49.916 --> 20:51.042
I apologize, sir.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.504
You're a thug too, aren't you?

20:55.046 --> 20:56.965
Listen closely, Gi-seok.

20:57.048 --> 20:59.676
I won't go down alone if I get indicted.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.473
What's with the look?

21:07.016 --> 21:09.852
You insolent prick, how dare you?
I'm your senior.

21:24.367 --> 21:26.285
It turns out that this fucking punk

21:27.578 --> 21:30.832
teamed up with Yeouido Rambo
right under your nose, sir.

21:39.799 --> 21:40.842
Mr. Kim.

21:47.515 --> 21:49.058
Why don't you admit it?

21:53.855 --> 21:55.106
Sure.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.526
Good.

22:01.446 --> 22:06.325
I will close the case
on Director Kim's embezzlement.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.288
But still, you're taking it too far
in front of your senior.

22:12.915 --> 22:16.919
I sincerely apologize for worrying you.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.716
For goodness sake. Geez.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.898
Chief Prosecutor, what about my case?

22:38.816 --> 22:39.984
Have a drink.

22:41.402 --> 22:42.779
I don't want to.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.449
I'll get some appetizers ready too.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.660
It was such a humiliation
at the book concert.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.370
Even the party leader was there.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.748
The reporters keep calling me.

22:53.831 --> 22:57.710
I've turned their eyes to another topic,
so let's wait it out.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.181
The Special Investigations team one

23:10.264 --> 23:13.434
raided Assemblyman Baek In-su's office
for a seize-and-search.

23:13.518 --> 23:17.021
The Special Investigations department
of the Seoul central prosecutors' office

23:17.105 --> 23:19.524
revealed that they have searched
Mr. Baek's office

23:19.607 --> 23:21.692
for evidence of illegal employment
of his son.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.282
Welcome, sir.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.662
I've sent the subpoena
for Assemblyman Baek.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.997
-Thank you, Woo-jin.
-Not at all, sir.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.333
I got this from Chief Park.

23:38.292 --> 23:39.502
Take a look.

23:40.336 --> 23:41.963
Jang Tae-chun…

23:42.046 --> 23:44.924
Yeah. He's the one
who blew up the Rambo case.

23:45.007 --> 23:46.425
Is the report of any use?

23:46.509 --> 23:50.721
The author of this report is unusual.
Isn't he from a no-name university?

23:50.805 --> 23:52.140
He is.

23:52.223 --> 23:54.267
Because he's from a lousy school,

23:54.350 --> 23:57.311
he really dug deep
into the silver-spoon corruption case.

23:57.395 --> 24:01.941
Although he's a paper tiger now,
he's served four consecutive terms.

24:02.024 --> 24:04.569
We needed to throw the liberals
some bait to chew on.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.947
-The informant?
-We're questioning her. But she's…

24:09.073 --> 24:10.449
-Why?
-Take a look, sir.

24:13.411 --> 24:15.288
PERSONAL DETAILS REPORT

24:15.371 --> 24:16.956
Park Joon-gyeong.

24:20.501 --> 24:24.380
On July 11,
did you go to a club in Cheongdam?

24:26.257 --> 24:30.761
It's not against military law for a single
person to go clubbing on a day off.

24:31.762 --> 24:35.057
After CEO Yoon's death,
she joined the army.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.686
-She's a major and a staff judge advocate.
-We have evidence.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.856
Then how will you explain…

24:43.691 --> 24:46.611
the CCTV footage here?

24:47.945 --> 24:51.532
Doesn't the bag you're carrying
belong to the intoxicated Rambo,

24:52.241 --> 24:53.784
Lee Chang-min?

24:54.368 --> 24:57.455
You are aware that this is theft, right?

24:57.538 --> 25:02.126
Also, leaking confidential material
can be considered trade-secret piracy.

25:11.177 --> 25:13.596
As the staff judge advocate,
I'm sure you know well

25:13.679 --> 25:18.267
that nothing good comes from staying
silent when the evidence is so clear.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.605
Doesn't Solar Bio work with patents
for new drugs?

25:22.688 --> 25:26.400
It's situational, but Rambo did use it
as evidence of stock-price manipulation.

25:27.485 --> 25:29.946
Add the remark about the patent law
on the indictment.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.239
Yes, sir.

25:33.824 --> 25:37.870
I'm an investigator from Army Prosecution.
We'll be taking her now.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.413
What the hell?

25:39.497 --> 25:42.583
-Can't you see we are questioning her?
-Who do you think you are?

25:42.667 --> 25:44.585
Article 44 of the Military Court Act.

25:44.669 --> 25:47.296
"The power to investigate a soldier
belongs to the army."

26:00.476 --> 26:01.560
Let's go.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.817
-What do we do?
-Just let them go.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.530
What about Kim Seong-tae?

26:13.531 --> 26:16.033
He voluntarily came
to Prosecutor Jang's office.

26:22.123 --> 26:25.293
You traded 10 billion with loan sharks
without your CEO knowing?

26:27.920 --> 26:33.217
Mr. Oh was in charge of external affairs,
while I took care of the company inside.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.803
What's up with your nose?

26:35.886 --> 26:38.055
A lanky piece of shit…

26:39.265 --> 26:41.142
I tripped.

26:46.063 --> 26:49.734
Assault, blackmail, fraud, and even drugs.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.277
Wow.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.323
You have quite the record.
You must've really used your iron fist.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.950
You and your stereotypes.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.370
Everyone who runs a business has
some kind of past record.

27:01.454 --> 27:04.623
I've seen many conglomerate heads
during my time in prison.

27:05.791 --> 27:09.503
How much do they pay to go to prison
for them? Enough to buy a house?

27:12.548 --> 27:14.425
I already own a few apartments.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.345
Do you know how much tax I pay for them?

27:17.887 --> 27:21.891
I'm not so poor that I would go to prison
for someone to earn some pocket change.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.895
All right, then. Let's dig deeper into it.

27:27.104 --> 27:30.733
I'm not clever, but I became a prosecutor
thanks to my perseverance.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.235
Well, let's dig deeper, then.

27:34.820 --> 27:38.032
Ma'am, order me a large jjajangmyeon.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.242
Not from Jageumseong, though.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.744
Order it from Seochobanjeom.

27:42.620 --> 27:43.996
What about you, Prosecutor?

27:44.872 --> 27:46.457
What do you think you're doing?

27:46.540 --> 27:49.460
It's going to be long, so let's eat first.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.214
Isn't Seochobanjeom the best
Chinese restaurant near this office?

28:01.889 --> 28:03.224
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.018
Yes.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.605
I'll be right up. Bye.

28:11.607 --> 28:13.109
Someone looking for you?

28:13.859 --> 28:16.654
Go ahead, while I enjoy my food.

28:16.737 --> 28:18.155
Chief,

28:19.115 --> 28:22.493
get everything ready
to hold this man in custody.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.751
I'll see you in different clothes
tomorrow.

28:30.835 --> 28:32.962
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

28:57.361 --> 29:00.239
The Special Investigations department
is on the 7th floor.

29:01.282 --> 29:03.284
I can't even open its door
with my employee ID card.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.119
ID CARD, JANG TAE-CHUN
CENTRAL PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

29:05.995 --> 29:07.538
You must be Jang Tae-chun.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.707
Oh, yes.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.546
Please follow me.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.635
Why did Chief Hwang Gi-seok call for me?

29:23.012 --> 29:25.598
Which could it be?
External pressure or placation?

29:32.855 --> 29:34.273
Hello, sir.

29:34.940 --> 29:37.776
Prosecutor Jang. Welcome. Come sit.

29:39.945 --> 29:41.113
Take a seat.

29:50.164 --> 29:53.542
It's hectic with the big case
in your hands, huh?

29:54.335 --> 29:57.546
You were pretty good in front
of the reporters for a first-timer.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.215
You must be a natural.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.384
If you called me about the case,
I have nothing to tell you.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.179
Why would I meddle in your case?

30:06.055 --> 30:08.224
I know how to keep my boundaries.

30:09.308 --> 30:13.145
I enjoyed reading the report
on Assemblyman Baek's case.

30:14.104 --> 30:17.566
Although your vocabulary
and investigation seem a bit rough,

30:17.650 --> 30:18.651
it's fine.

30:18.734 --> 30:20.027
Actually, pretty good.

30:26.951 --> 30:30.079
-I hear you want to join our department.
-Excuse me?

30:30.162 --> 30:33.123
Chief Park told me you are
quite ambitious for big cases.

30:33.207 --> 30:34.416
Am I wrong?

30:35.042 --> 30:38.462
You cornered him well,
so wrap up the case nicely.

30:39.046 --> 30:41.757
When everything settles down,
I'll buy you a drink.

30:43.384 --> 30:44.385
What's the matter?

30:44.468 --> 30:47.721
I finally found a prosecutor
worthy of joining my department.

30:47.805 --> 30:49.890
So I should buy you a drink as a senior.

30:51.559 --> 30:52.643
"Senior"?

30:53.769 --> 30:56.772
Have you ever met with your seniors
from the anti-corruption department?

30:57.940 --> 30:59.066
Seniors…

30:59.900 --> 31:01.026
No, sir.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.361
We'll meet them too.

31:03.195 --> 31:06.282
They've taken on big cases several times,
so I'm sure they'll be helpful.

31:07.533 --> 31:11.036
-Yes, sir.
-Show me the indictment when finished.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.539
You've worked hard on it,
so I'll review it.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.457
Keep this in mind:

31:16.709 --> 31:18.794
Law books are ideals,

31:19.545 --> 31:20.838
but this is reality.

31:23.382 --> 31:24.633
Hold on.

31:29.722 --> 31:32.641
You must be busy. You may leave now.
I'm getting a call.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.813
Have a good day, sir.

31:50.618 --> 31:51.619
Hello?

31:51.702 --> 31:53.412
Gosh, my son-in-law.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.498
Looking at how long it took for you
to pick up my call,

31:56.582 --> 31:58.667
you must be busy serving your country.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.420
-Did you eat?
-Please get to the point.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.922
Did you talk to Prosecutor Jang,
the rookie?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.467
Were you able to get through to him?

32:06.550 --> 32:10.387
Do you want a report or something?
Leave us alone so we can do our jobs.

32:10.471 --> 32:11.472
SON-IN-LAW

32:11.555 --> 32:13.182
That wasn't what I wanted to talk about.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.226
I'm thinking of wrapping up GMI Bank.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.604
Sure. I'd appreciate it
if you could do it yourself.

32:18.687 --> 32:19.730
Seriously?

32:19.813 --> 32:22.107
Why are you giving me the cold shoulder?

32:22.191 --> 32:25.110
This is all family business.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.697
The shares your wife has, the 20%--

32:29.281 --> 32:30.783
Is it okay if I move that?

32:31.533 --> 32:32.534
Hold on.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.580
What about the chief prosecutors' shares?

32:36.664 --> 32:41.001
Those old goats' shares
will be taken care of through Mr. Oh.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.170
So don't you worry.

32:43.253 --> 32:44.713
How's Mr. Oh doing?

32:53.180 --> 32:54.723
He's doing just fine.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.277
What are you looking at?

33:08.028 --> 33:09.697
The NYSE market closed today.

33:10.531 --> 33:14.159
I'm looking at GMI bank.
Chairman Myung began the delisting plan.

33:14.952 --> 33:16.036
Delisting?

33:16.912 --> 33:18.706
He's destroying evidence.

33:18.789 --> 33:21.208
It's like scrapping a car
after a hit-and-run.

33:21.291 --> 33:25.671
Destroying evidence of stock manipulation
by delisting it?

33:26.505 --> 33:28.841
It's easier for the prosecutor
watching their backs,

33:28.924 --> 33:30.759
since they can't investigate any further.

33:31.719 --> 33:34.430
They'll throw away all they have
to protect Oh Chang-hyeon.

33:35.139 --> 33:38.267
I looked into it, and Chairman Myung's
connections to the prosecution

33:39.226 --> 33:42.229
are being handled by CEO Oh,
a former chief prosecutor.

33:45.107 --> 33:47.735
That means we have to take
CEO Oh down first.

33:50.779 --> 33:54.450
Hey, is there anything in here
other than veggies?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.118
Like some chicken?

33:56.201 --> 33:57.870
How about we order chicken?

33:57.953 --> 34:00.289
People say K Chicken
is the best these days.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.459
Hey, just eat this.
These days, vegan food is the best.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.503
Why are you against everything
I want to do?

34:06.587 --> 34:07.796
Seriously…

34:11.300 --> 34:14.094
Hey, hold on. Are there any
convertible bonds of GMI Bank

34:14.178 --> 34:16.305
used illegally to obtain cash in April
at Dongdaemun?

34:16.388 --> 34:18.640
You think you can dig into that?

34:18.724 --> 34:20.934
The cartels there
are close to Chairman Myung.

34:22.603 --> 34:26.023
I'm aware. I know them pretty well too.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.615
The cartels in Dongdaemun
are divided into four areas,

34:34.698 --> 34:37.409
north, south, east, west,
bordering the clothing shops.

34:37.493 --> 34:41.288
The leaders of the cartels are women
who collect money from the shops.

34:41.371 --> 34:45.417
Of them, Ms. Kim from the west,
was the greediest.

34:50.506 --> 34:52.174
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

34:52.257 --> 34:55.928
Manager Eun, have you spoken to
the chairman about starting on your own?

34:56.011 --> 34:58.514
He even knows that I'm meeting you today.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.598
Is that so?

35:00.724 --> 35:02.643
Will he provide you with connections?

35:04.144 --> 35:05.979
You know he's not the type.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.275
Gosh, that greedy old goat.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.737
I'd be willing to help you out, Mr. Eun.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.323
You know it's not easy
to find good clients.

35:17.491 --> 35:18.951
I already have one.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.203
A very trustworthy client.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.121
Who? How many orders?

35:24.832 --> 35:26.083
About 30.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.044
But you have to keep this a secret.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.548
I've been in the business long enough
to know that.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.299
Your secret is safe with me.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.889
When I was standing on my own feet
from Chairman Myung,

35:42.599 --> 35:46.228
Ms. Yoon's Bluenet was investing
everything it had into patents

35:46.311 --> 35:47.771
on chipset technology.

35:47.855 --> 35:51.400
But… do you have the money to do it?

35:53.277 --> 35:55.237
I've been preparing for a year now,

35:55.320 --> 35:58.115
and I have the cartel leaders
on my side as well.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.286
Why are you trying to stand
on your own feet?

36:04.496 --> 36:05.622
Chairman Myung--

36:07.040 --> 36:08.667
He's too greedy.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.213
I already have a supplier.

36:13.797 --> 36:17.759
So I'll compare the rates with yours
and make a decision.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.178
It's just business, so we're okay, right?

36:20.262 --> 36:23.515
You'll get a percent cheaper rate
than your supplier with no conditions.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.561
Because I'm someone you know?

36:28.812 --> 36:32.941
If you can get a patent on the chipset,
the company will become big.

36:33.025 --> 36:36.445
I'm cutting the rates based on
what I've learned, since it's business.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.951
I look forward to working with you,
Mr. Eun.

36:46.580 --> 36:47.789
Thank you so much.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.377
I think Mongyu will do so well.
What do I do?

36:53.045 --> 36:56.214
Hey, then how about
you give me a cigarette?

36:56.298 --> 36:57.341
All right.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.094
Here you go.

37:01.178 --> 37:04.681
I have the perfect gift to celebrate
the opening of your office.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.892
Really? What could it be?

37:07.935 --> 37:11.271
-Money toad?
-No need for superstitions like that.

37:11.355 --> 37:13.148
You need a picture of me in there.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.442
I was blessed with wealth.

37:15.525 --> 37:17.069
Gosh, of course.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.196
-What the hell?
-My goodness.

37:19.279 --> 37:22.115
-Hey, Major!
-Are you smoking again, Mom?

37:22.199 --> 37:25.118
-What do you mean?
-Not at all. This is mine.

37:25.202 --> 37:27.829
Didn't I tell you to
stop bringing cigarettes here?

37:28.497 --> 37:29.498
I'll quit.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.876
Oh, hey. You two must be starving.
Let's go eat.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.711
Gosh, I'm so famished.

37:34.795 --> 37:36.380
No cigarettes in my house.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.340
A student shouldn't be
coming home this early.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.051
Do you not have a boyfriend?
If not, you should get one.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.151
-Sir.
-Yes.

37:59.319 --> 38:03.073
I bought a few of the loan ledgers
you asked for.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.409
Thank you.

38:05.492 --> 38:08.328
I'm asking such absurd favors
to a global hedge-fund partner.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.288
I'm glad you know.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.583
But I had a good time. It's been a while.

38:13.667 --> 38:17.879
M&A negotiation and market bargaining
are basically the same thing.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.966
We bought them for cheap,
so let's sell them at a high price.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.635
I'll catch CEO Oh with this.

38:25.512 --> 38:29.099
Let's have dinner.
I'll treat you to a nice place tonight.

38:29.182 --> 38:30.183
Well…

38:30.267 --> 38:34.021
I'm going to do some shopping
while I'm here.

38:34.104 --> 38:35.313
You should take my car.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.734
Do I have somewhere to be?

38:39.693 --> 38:41.111
Major Park Joon-gyeong.

38:41.194 --> 38:44.740
She managed to escape the prosecution
since she's a soldier.

38:58.336 --> 39:02.007
Joon-gyeong's opponent, Chairman Myung,

39:02.090 --> 39:04.676
was once my mentor, who taught me
all about the money business.

39:28.241 --> 39:30.160
The last job I did for him,

39:31.078 --> 39:32.496
right before I went rogue,

39:32.579 --> 39:34.998
was the beginning
of this bad relationship.

39:35.082 --> 39:36.333
On that very night.

39:55.018 --> 39:56.228
Yes, sir.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.355
Yes, I'm here.

39:59.147 --> 40:00.732
But I don't see anyone.

40:01.900 --> 40:02.901
Yes, sir.

40:04.277 --> 40:05.320
Okay.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.574
Yes. I am in front of the church.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.287
Okay, got it. Goodbye.

41:09.676 --> 41:12.762
Oh, my. You're killing the kid.

41:18.852 --> 41:19.853
Sir.

41:21.521 --> 41:22.731
Why are you doing this?

41:22.814 --> 41:26.568
You were such a competent employee,
Manager Eun.

41:27.861 --> 41:29.654
You skyrocketed our earnings.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.117
But look here, you punk.

41:34.201 --> 41:37.579
If the goose laying golden eggs
wants to leave,

41:38.371 --> 41:40.290
what is its owner supposed to do?

41:41.708 --> 41:45.337
It would be logical to split it open
for the last golden egg

41:45.420 --> 41:47.714
and eat what's left of it, no?

41:59.768 --> 42:01.728
STOCK TRANSFER CERTIFICATE

42:03.063 --> 42:05.357
Come on. I'll put it in here.

42:11.279 --> 42:15.200
I'll wrap up the deal with CEO Yoon.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.535
And I'm warning you:

42:18.203 --> 42:20.538
If I hear that your money,
even a single penny,

42:20.622 --> 42:22.540
is rolling around in Myung-dong,

42:23.291 --> 42:25.377
your older sister won't be safe.

42:27.420 --> 42:30.423
He must be in pain. Give him some liquor.

42:34.010 --> 42:35.262
Yes, Prosecutor.

42:35.345 --> 42:37.347
I'm on my way, sir.

42:38.682 --> 42:41.810
Have a drink or two first.
I'll be there soon.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.186
Yes, sir.

42:45.522 --> 42:47.023
Does it hurt?

42:47.774 --> 42:49.067
Does it hurt a lot?

42:50.402 --> 42:52.279
Then you'll need one of these.

43:04.916 --> 43:08.211
Just endure it a little. This won't hurt.

43:25.353 --> 43:26.354
Bring it on.

43:26.980 --> 43:28.398
Bring it on, damn it.

43:34.654 --> 43:35.697
Get him!

44:27.457 --> 44:28.500
Hey!

44:29.334 --> 44:30.627
Are you okay, sir?

45:48.705 --> 45:50.582
The world was always a jungle.

45:52.876 --> 45:56.254
I was the one who drew the short stick
in the game called life.

45:57.130 --> 45:58.214
-Oh, my gosh!
-You prick!

45:58.298 --> 45:59.632
You bastard!

45:59.716 --> 46:02.135
-How the hell am I supposed to know?
-Where is he?

46:02.218 --> 46:03.511
You jerk!

46:03.595 --> 46:05.472
Survival of the strongest.
Winner takes all.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.099
In a jungle where money rules…

46:10.685 --> 46:12.061
law and justice

46:12.854 --> 46:14.814
was a luxury I was never granted with.

46:52.769 --> 46:54.687
The only way to take back what's stolen

46:55.480 --> 47:00.777
is to fight and win…
with your own strength.

47:02.987 --> 47:04.822
STOCK TRANSFER CERTIFICATE

47:10.954 --> 47:13.248
The shares you used as collateral

47:13.915 --> 47:15.708
have been taken by Chairman Myung?

47:19.837 --> 47:22.966
No wonder
the stocks were dropping recently.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.176
I'm sorry.

47:27.637 --> 47:30.765
What about your injuries? Are you okay?
Have you been to the hospital?

47:33.560 --> 47:35.645
Chairman Myung will short the stock…

47:35.728 --> 47:36.896
SHORT SELLING:
INVESTMENT STRATEGY

47:36.980 --> 47:38.231
SELLING BORROWED STOCKS
TO DROP PRICE

47:38.314 --> 47:39.649
…and force the company to be delisted.

47:41.234 --> 47:42.735
I'll take care of that.

47:43.486 --> 47:44.946
You focus on recovering.

47:45.029 --> 47:46.990
We can beat them at their own game.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.952
I know every detail
of his shorting strategies

47:51.828 --> 47:53.288
and embezzlement.

48:04.465 --> 48:07.302
Are you saying
you want to manipulate the stock price?

48:07.385 --> 48:08.886
Yes.

48:08.970 --> 48:10.930
-If you allow it, that is.
-I won't.

48:11.514 --> 48:14.100
My attorney will solve the issue
with the company.

48:14.183 --> 48:15.184
No.

48:17.020 --> 48:20.189
You can't win by playing fair
in this dirty playing field.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.442
You cannot beat Chairman Myung

48:23.776 --> 48:25.111
with law and principles.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.496
I rented out a closed Internet café
in the suburbs…

48:35.580 --> 48:37.332
Thank you.

48:37.415 --> 48:38.625
Nice to meet you.

48:38.708 --> 48:42.962
…and recruited those who have lost money
due to Chairman Myung.

48:43.046 --> 48:44.797
Yes, take your seats. Thank you.

48:44.881 --> 48:46.716
Confidentiality is crucial when planning.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.177
Our plan will only succeed

48:49.260 --> 48:52.597
if everyone here works together in unity.

48:53.222 --> 48:56.392
I firmly believe
that it will be a success.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.561
I look forward to working with you.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.483
We restricted the floor
and carried out our plan for two weeks.

49:03.566 --> 49:05.818
Our plan will commence
from this moment on.

49:09.656 --> 49:11.574
Yes, number 12, Daeyong Securities.

49:11.658 --> 49:13.242
Buy 500 shares at 2,800.

49:13.326 --> 49:16.287
And number three and seven,
buy 2,000 shares, okay?

49:16.371 --> 49:18.122
Waiting for 3,200. Stand by.

49:19.999 --> 49:22.251
We worked our game plan
at PC Internet cafés.

49:22.335 --> 49:26.130
This would've been impossible
in these IP-trackable tech savvy days.

49:26.214 --> 49:28.841
But it was possible back then.

49:28.925 --> 49:30.927
Let's do it more quickly. Concentrate.

49:31.010 --> 49:33.513
Timing is key here.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.515
Number 11, buy 2,000 shares.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.475
Numbers three, six, nine,
buy 8,000 shares.

49:37.558 --> 49:39.894
From number ten.
Get ready to buy at 4,500.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.771
Not yet. Just wait a moment.

49:43.022 --> 49:44.482
Right now, 4,500.

49:44.565 --> 49:46.442
The rest just follow up.

49:47.026 --> 49:50.029
All right. Numbers three, six, seven
will buy at 8,500.

49:50.113 --> 49:52.281
Number ten will go at 8,700.

49:53.366 --> 49:58.496
We'll watch how it works out
and take it slow from now on.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.833
Number four, Sinheung Securities.

50:02.417 --> 50:04.502
Buy 5,000 shares at 6,200 won.

50:05.503 --> 50:08.715
Right, Daeyong Securities, number 12.
It's 2,000 shares, okay?

50:08.798 --> 50:12.093
Numbers three and seven,
you are both 1,000 shares each.

50:12.677 --> 50:15.138
Let's sell 4,900 shares from number ten!

50:28.901 --> 50:31.362
All right, we're going up. Looking good.

50:31.446 --> 50:34.157
It's going up! Great!

50:36.200 --> 50:38.244
What's wrong with the stocks?

50:38.327 --> 50:41.873
-I think there's a concert party.
-My goodness. Seriously?

50:41.956 --> 50:44.584
Then just don't sit back and watch.

50:44.667 --> 50:46.085
Stop them by buying more shares,

50:46.169 --> 50:49.505
or use the press to spread bad rumors
about the company.

50:49.589 --> 50:52.508
Chairman Myung tried to shake us off
by reporting bad news and shorting stocks.

50:52.592 --> 50:54.343
BLUENET SALES HALVED
TARGET STOCK PRICE FALLS

50:54.427 --> 50:56.304
BLUENET CEO PAID MINIMUM WAGE

50:56.387 --> 50:57.638
BLUENET NET WORTH FALLS 14%

50:57.722 --> 51:02.393
All right. Whenever they short a stock,
we buy one right away.

51:02.477 --> 51:06.522
We're almost done here, okay?
Let's speed this up a bit.

51:06.606 --> 51:08.983
-Okay!
-Number 11, 11,000 won.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.902
Number four, 11,500 won.

51:10.985 --> 51:13.362
Numbers ten, eight, nine, at 12,000 won.

51:13.446 --> 51:15.364
-Click the "buy" button!
-All right!

51:24.916 --> 51:29.086
With all the apes following up
thanks to the age of the Internet,

51:30.171 --> 51:31.881
the battle was decisive.

51:31.964 --> 51:34.842
For stock shorting,
which relies on stocks plummeting,

51:35.510 --> 51:37.178
there is a limit on the profit.

51:37.762 --> 51:41.474
Even if the stock crashes,
it can't go below zero.

51:41.557 --> 51:44.310
Right,
but if the short sellers lose money,

51:45.478 --> 51:47.355
they can lose an infinite amount.

51:48.564 --> 51:51.317
There's no limit
to how much a stock can go up.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.321
If we pressure them with this,

51:56.614 --> 51:59.200
I'm confident that
we can beat the short sellers.

52:01.327 --> 52:03.329
I'm sure raising the stock price

52:03.913 --> 52:07.875
can be done
with the amount of shares I have.

52:08.793 --> 52:12.380
But our opponent is colluding
with a mega-securities company.

52:13.214 --> 52:14.966
You think you can hold up?

52:15.049 --> 52:17.385
This is the age of the Internet.

52:17.468 --> 52:21.681
If we give them the proper information
instead of fake news,

52:21.764 --> 52:24.183
the retail investors
will definitely be on our side.

52:26.394 --> 52:27.645
How are you so sure?

52:28.563 --> 52:30.773
Because the values
of your company are real.

52:32.233 --> 52:34.527
Just as you believed in me,
I believe in you.

52:35.653 --> 52:37.572
I believe in your values.

52:43.160 --> 52:46.038
Bluenet has successfully patented

52:46.122 --> 52:48.291
its chipset technology in the US.

52:48.374 --> 52:51.669
Yoon Hye-rin, CEO of Bluenet,
developer of a revolutionary chipset

52:51.752 --> 52:55.047
integrating four accessory systems,

52:55.131 --> 53:01.012
expressed her ambitions
to create world standard technology.

53:01.095 --> 53:02.096
…meet all challenges.

53:02.179 --> 53:04.098
This is a revolutionary find.

53:04.181 --> 53:06.309
Bluenet's shares hit the ceiling,
yet again,

53:06.392 --> 53:08.019
continuing its uptrend.

53:08.102 --> 53:09.604
BLUENET'S CHIPSET, US PATENTED

53:09.687 --> 53:10.771
Bluenet's KOSPI index--

53:16.694 --> 53:19.030
Today is the due date
of the short selling.

53:19.113 --> 53:21.490
Make sure you wire me the loss
by 3:00 p.m.

53:21.574 --> 53:23.075
The total is 87 billion won.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.494
You want to divide up the profit,

53:26.495 --> 53:29.665
but you want me to cover the loss
all by myself?

53:29.749 --> 53:31.125
Well, then,

53:31.208 --> 53:35.713
should we follow the law
and become fellow prisoners, huh?

53:36.714 --> 53:39.091
It's 8,687,500,000 won.

53:39.884 --> 53:43.054
Don't leave out a penny.
And don't be late.

53:43.804 --> 53:44.805
Got it?

53:47.683 --> 53:49.060
That bastard.

54:01.614 --> 54:02.949
I've prepared a gift

54:03.991 --> 54:05.409
that's impossible to trace.

54:06.202 --> 54:08.120
These are 100,000-won checks.

54:08.204 --> 54:09.914
-Yes!
-Wow!

54:09.997 --> 54:13.542
I will give you twice as much
as what I had promised.

54:15.962 --> 54:18.089
-Yes!
-Let's go!

54:25.012 --> 54:26.472
-Thank you.
-Good work.

54:26.555 --> 54:27.598
Thank you!

54:31.268 --> 54:33.229
The strategy was a success.

54:34.105 --> 54:35.982
Only the final stage remained.

54:40.111 --> 54:42.196
Stock manipulation

54:42.989 --> 54:46.701
is a serious crime
that negatively influences

54:46.784 --> 54:49.453
the decency of the capitalistic market.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.872
Don't you think so, Prosecutor?

54:51.956 --> 54:53.708
LEE SU-DONG, LEAD PROSECUTOR
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS

54:53.791 --> 54:57.795
So, do you have any solid proof
that Manager Eun was behind all that?

54:59.171 --> 55:03.134
You know how things work here.

55:04.802 --> 55:08.389
If you take him into custody
and interrogate him,

55:08.472 --> 55:10.474
don't you think they will find evidence?

55:10.558 --> 55:14.311
But still, there needs to be grounds
to issue an arrest warrant.

55:17.732 --> 55:21.652
His older sister runs a bar
called Forget-Me-Not.

55:22.319 --> 55:24.613
-You know how running a bar is.
-I see.

55:24.697 --> 55:26.615
Something will come out
if we look into it.

55:26.699 --> 55:27.825
Of course, sir.

55:28.409 --> 55:31.162
As expected, Prosecutor Lee,
you catch on really quickly.

55:41.130 --> 55:43.924
I've prepared some dessert
for you to take home.

55:47.344 --> 55:48.721
You have a guest.

55:49.847 --> 55:53.017
Miss, I don't know who it is,
but you came to the wrong room.

55:53.100 --> 55:54.769
I called him.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.103
Bring him in.

56:07.448 --> 56:08.866
Look who this is.

56:12.620 --> 56:14.955
It's been a while, Chairman Myung.

56:21.253 --> 56:24.548
I mean, Manager Eun over here,

56:24.632 --> 56:27.885
he has a knack for memorizing numbers.

56:29.553 --> 56:33.557
He told me some of
your borrowed-name accounts.

56:36.352 --> 56:37.686
I found lots of issues.

56:40.856 --> 56:42.817
Forget about the dessert.

56:42.900 --> 56:44.276
You can have it back.

56:44.860 --> 56:47.863
I don't want my belly to pop out
with all those sweets anyway.

56:49.490 --> 56:50.825
By the look of it,

56:50.908 --> 56:54.787
I think something troubling happened
between you two while working.

56:56.122 --> 56:59.041
So why don't you relax
and have a nice time together

57:00.000 --> 57:01.710
and talk things out peacefully?

57:07.091 --> 57:08.634
Goodbye, sir.

57:18.894 --> 57:20.813
Desserts won't do.

57:20.896 --> 57:23.149
I gave him 10% of my shares.

57:25.860 --> 57:29.196
You punk. How dare you run your mouth?

57:29.280 --> 57:30.573
Watch me.

57:31.365 --> 57:32.908
I'm going to kill you.

57:32.992 --> 57:37.246
Regarding the assault last time, I'll
settle for the money I made this time.

57:37.329 --> 57:42.168
Hey. Above Prosecutor Lee, there's his
chief, deputy chief, and chief prosecutor.

57:43.252 --> 57:44.670
I'm well aware.

57:44.753 --> 57:48.799
The borrowed-name accounts they use
for dirty money are in my head.

57:48.883 --> 57:50.843
How can I not know?

57:51.677 --> 57:54.221
You want me to write
those accounts down too?

58:05.232 --> 58:06.609
Let's settle this peacefully.

58:07.359 --> 58:09.820
I'll leave the country within a week.

58:11.572 --> 58:15.951
Oh, right. As for Myung-dong, you can do
whatever you want, like always.

58:20.122 --> 58:21.457
Why?

58:21.540 --> 58:24.793
The sword's already drawn,
so let's fight until the end.

58:27.171 --> 58:29.548
I might have, if you fought with money.

58:30.841 --> 58:32.593
But you fight using real knives.

58:38.849 --> 58:40.184
However,

58:41.936 --> 58:43.520
do not harm my family.

58:46.982 --> 58:48.692
That is my one and only condition.

59:01.580 --> 59:06.001
Chairman Myung…
should've left my family alone.

1:00:31.211 --> 1:00:33.130
Still don't carry umbrellas with you?

1:01:26.975 --> 1:01:29.061
The only person he wants to save is you.

1:01:29.144 --> 1:01:32.189
Chief Hwang is not one to talk nonsense.

1:01:32.272 --> 1:01:34.274
He keeps all of his promises.

1:01:34.358 --> 1:01:37.861
Rambo says the prosecutor-in-charge
is a straight shooter.

1:01:37.945 --> 1:01:41.115
My son-in-law will take care of the kid.

1:01:41.198 --> 1:01:43.075
-Let's take a new approach.
-What?

1:01:43.158 --> 1:01:46.412
Baek argues the accusation against his son
is a vindictive investigation.

1:01:46.495 --> 1:01:48.872
Prosecutor Jang Tae-chun ordered it.

1:01:48.956 --> 1:01:52.334
This fight isn't for you to fight alone.

1:01:53.419 --> 1:01:56.213
You and I are on the same team.
