(male announcer)
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.104 --> 00:06.307
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.043
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.077 --> 00:10.711
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.744 --> 00:12.280
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.313 --> 00:14.315
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.550
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.520
ANTHONY, YOU PUSH AVERY
AND I'LL TAKE MINNIE.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.289
NO, I CAN DO IT.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.423
DON'T LET HER LEAD.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.325
STOP, GIRL!
MINNIE, HEEL!

00:24.358 --> 00:26.694
HEEL!
OH, MINNIE!

00:26.727 --> 00:29.197
GET YOUR ASS
BACK HERE!
STOP, GIRL!

00:30.764 --> 00:33.367
(Anthony)
STOP, GIRL!

00:38.506 --> 00:40.174
BAD DOG.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.509
[baby cries]

00:41.542 --> 00:42.776
STOP. STOP!

00:42.810 --> 00:45.479
STOP!
STAY THERE.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.081
[baby cries]

00:47.115 --> 00:49.617
STOP!
GET AWAY FROM MY BABY.

00:55.123 --> 00:57.391
HE WAS CRYING.

00:57.425 --> 00:59.660
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.569
[sighs]

01:08.602 --> 01:10.871
[breathes heavily]

01:10.904 --> 01:13.641
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.509
KELLY SUN.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.611
25, RAPED, BEATEN,

01:17.645 --> 01:19.247
WANDERING
IN RIVERSIDE PARK.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.514
OH, GOD.
HOW'S SHE DOING?

01:20.548 --> 01:22.116
OH, IT COULD
BE A LOT WORSE.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.417
JUDGING BY THE DIRT
AND CUTS ON HER FEET,

01:23.451 --> 01:25.119
I'D SAY SHE WAS
WANDERING AROUND FOR HOURS.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.388
EXPLAINS WHY CSU
CAN'T FIND A CRIME SCENE.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.556
HOW ABOUT THE RAPE KIT?

01:28.589 --> 01:31.459
POSITIVE FOR FLUIDS,
BRUISING, AND TEARING.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.362
BUT I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT HER MENTAL STATE.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.464
(Kelly)
GET OFF OF ME!
NO, LET ME OUT OF HERE.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.232
(nurse)
HONEY, YOU'RE IN
NO SHAPE TO LEAVE.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.667
NO, I'M GONNA
MISS MY PLANE.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.302
KELLY, KELLY, KELLY.
CALM DOWN.
SHH. HEY. SHH.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.603
(Benson)
CALM--KELLY,
YOU'RE IN SHOCK.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.838
CALM DOWN.
NO, I HAVE TO BE
IN KOREA ON FRIDAY.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.740
TODAY'S FRIDAY.
TODAY'S FRIDAY.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.477
YOU'VE LOST TRACK OF TIME.
YOU WERE ATTACKED.

01:49.510 --> 01:52.280
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:52.313 --> 01:55.283
YOU WERE RAPED.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.351
OH, MY GOD.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.819
[breathing heavily]

01:58.852 --> 02:02.623
WHY--WHY DON'T
I REMEMBER?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.410
HERE'S KELLY'S COAT.

02:56.444 --> 02:57.778
SHE'S STILL
IN THE SHOWER.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.880
BLOODHOUNDS GET A SCENT,
MAYBE THEY CAN, UH,

02:59.913 --> 03:01.349
TRACK BACK TO WHERE
KELLY WAS RAPED.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.416
SHE WAS WALKING
AROUND FOR HOURS.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.684
THEY'RE WASTING
THEIR TIME.

03:03.717 --> 03:04.952
IT'S BETTER
THAN DOING NOTHING.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.454
WE'RE NOT GONNA GET
MUCH OUT OF HER.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.389
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WORSE--

03:08.422 --> 03:10.658
NOT BEING ABLE
TO REMEMBER YOUR ATTACK

03:10.691 --> 03:11.925
OR NOT BEING ABLE
TO FORGET IT.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.394
KELLY'S READY.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.395
ALL RIGHT,
WELL, LOOK--

03:14.428 --> 03:16.297
MAYBE SHE'LL TELL YOU
MORE ONE-ON-ONE, HUH?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.598
YEAH.

03:20.468 --> 03:22.470
(Benson)
HEY, KELLY,
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

03:22.503 --> 03:24.772
STILL FEEL SO DIRTY.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.541
IT'LL PROBABLY
TAKE A WHILE.

03:29.377 --> 03:30.411
[gasps]

03:30.444 --> 03:33.013
THOSE BRUISES ARE FROM
YOUR ATTACKER'S KNEES

03:33.046 --> 03:34.615
WHEN HE FORCED
YOUR LEGS APART.

03:34.648 --> 03:35.916
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.518
I--I--I'M A TRAVEL WRITER.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.852
I--I'VE TRAVELED
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.588
I KNOW HOW
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.757
I WOULD NEVER
LET ANYBODY RAPE ME.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.526
KELLY, THIS CAN
HAPPEN TO ANYONE.

03:45.559 --> 03:48.462
WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER?

03:48.496 --> 03:50.431
BECAUSE WE THINK
YOU WERE DRUGGED.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.667
LIKE, WITH ROOFIE?
OR GHB.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.002
IT'S VERY EASY TO SLIP
INTO SOMEBODY'S DRINK

03:55.035 --> 03:56.804
WHEN THEY'RE NOT LOOKING.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.506
WE'LL KNOW MORE WHEN
YOUR TOX SCREEN COMES BACK.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.874
[cries]

04:00.908 --> 04:03.577
HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN
SO STUPID?

04:03.611 --> 04:04.912
KELLY.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.514
LISTEN TO ME.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.517
THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

04:09.550 --> 04:12.620
IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY
TOOK OVER MY BODY

04:12.653 --> 04:14.488
AND I WASN'T
EVEN INSIDE IT.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.589
KELLY.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.661
WHY DON'T WE FOCUS ON
WHAT YOU DO REMEMBER, OKAY?

04:20.694 --> 04:22.896
NO, IT'S--

04:22.930 --> 04:26.767
IT'S ALL A BLANK.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.469
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT YESTERDAY MORNING?

04:28.502 --> 04:29.803
[inhales shakily]

04:29.837 --> 04:31.672
I, UH--

04:31.705 --> 04:34.007
I WAS PACKING FOR
MY TRIP TO KOREA.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.844
AND, UH, RUNNING ERRANDS

04:36.877 --> 04:40.080
AND I, UH--

04:40.113 --> 04:41.949
I WENT TO CHINATOWN
AROUND NOON.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.317
OKAY. ALONE?

04:43.351 --> 04:44.518
YEAH.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.886
WAIT, NO, I, UH,

04:45.919 --> 04:49.757
I RAN INTO RILEY SLADE

04:49.790 --> 04:51.925
COMING OUT
OF THE SUBWAY.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.461
IS RILEY
A FRIEND OF YOURS?

04:53.494 --> 04:54.628
[sighs]

04:54.662 --> 04:56.430
MORE LIKE
A "FRENEMY" NOW.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.898
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.900
WE, UH, WE BOTH WORK
FOR THE SAME PUBLISHER.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.737
LAST YEAR,
RILEY WROTE A BOOK ABOUT

05:03.771 --> 05:05.539
BIKING THROUGH INDONESIA,

05:05.573 --> 05:07.841
BUT HE'D NEVER EVEN
SET FOOT THERE.

05:07.875 --> 05:10.411
IT'S JUST
TOTALLY UNETHICAL.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.479
SO YOU TURNED HIM IN.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.813
YEAH.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.582
THEY FIRED HIM.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.850
I BET HE WASN'T
TOO THRILLED ABOUT THAT.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.521
YOU THINK HE RAPED ME?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.855
(Riley)
RAPED HER?

05:21.889 --> 05:23.591
I OWE THAT CHICK
MY GRATITUDE.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.725
FOR BUSTING YA?

05:24.758 --> 05:25.993
GOT PEOPLE
TO READ MY BOOK.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.461
EDITORS FIGURE

05:27.495 --> 05:28.929
IF I CAN WRITE
A SMASH FROM MY LIVING ROOM,

05:28.962 --> 05:30.498
IMAGINE WHAT I CAN DO IF
I ACTUALLY LEFT MY APARTMENT.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.799
DID YOU LEAVE IT
LAST NIGHT?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.033
YEAH.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.535
I DID A SCREEN TEST
FOR JETSETTER NETWORK.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.636
THEY WANT TO GIVE ME
MY OWN CABLE SHOW.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.938
SLADERUNNER.
PRETTY CATCHY, HUH?

05:37.971 --> 05:40.474
YEAH, MAKE SURE I FORGET
TO PROGRAM MY TIVO, HUH?

05:40.508 --> 05:41.409
LOOK, I'M SORRY
SHE GOT HURT,

05:41.442 --> 05:43.977
BUT KELLY WASN'T
CUT OUT FOR THIS BUSINESS.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.513
BUT YOU ARE?

05:45.546 --> 05:46.680
YOU GOTTA
GAME THE SYSTEM.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.417
NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.551
TRAVEL ON SOMEBODY
ELSE'S DIME.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.052
SOUNDS LIKE A SCAM.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.721
EVERYBODY DOES IT.
EVEN KELLY.

05:53.754 --> 05:54.855
KELLY DIDN'T PAY
HER OWN WAY TO KOREA?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.424
PLEASE.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.826
SHE GOT A FREE ROUND-TRIP
TICKET WORKING AS A COURIER.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.160
FOR WHO?

06:00.193 --> 06:02.062
COMPANY CALLED
PAKIDALA.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.734
(Sam)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
KELLY'S IN THE HOSPITAL--

06:06.767 --> 06:08.035
IN SEOUL?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.570
NO. HERE.
[cell phone ringing]

06:09.603 --> 06:11.605
GOD, THAT'S AWFUL.
SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

06:11.639 --> 06:12.873
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME.
[chuckles]

06:12.906 --> 06:14.475
THE MARKS BROTHERS
ARE GONNA HAVE MY ASS.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.477
THEY'RE DEAD.
NOT THE COMEDIANS.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.479
THESE BROTHERS
ARE JEWELERS.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.481
A BLING RING'S HIT THEM
FOUR TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.082
YOU SENT
A DEFENSELESS GIRL

06:22.115 --> 06:24.618
UP AGAINST PROFESSIONAL
JEWEL THIEVES?

06:24.652 --> 06:25.686
OUR CLIENTS ARE HASIDIM.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.987
KELLY'S A CHINESE EMPRESS.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.989
WE THOUGHT SHE'D FLY
SAFELY UNDER THE RADAR.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.091
PLEASE TELL ME
SHE STILL HAS HER POUCH.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.493
EXCUSE ME?

06:32.526 --> 06:33.360
THE ONE
SHE WAS CARRYING

06:33.393 --> 06:36.597
WITH $700,000
WORTH OF UNCUT DIAMONDS.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.999
(Benson)
KELLY, YOU SHOULD
HAVE TOLD ME.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.534
[sighs]

06:40.568 --> 06:42.770
I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO LET
THE DIAMONDS OUT OF MY SIGHT.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.905
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PAY
BACK THE MARKS BROTHERS?

06:44.938 --> 06:46.607
THEY PROBABLY HAVE
INSURANCE FOR THAT,

06:46.640 --> 06:47.741
BUT YOU NEED TO TELL ME

06:47.775 --> 06:49.042
EVERYTHING
THAT YOU REMEMBER.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.878
OKAY, WELL, I WENT TO GO
PICK UP THE DIAMONDS,

06:50.911 --> 06:53.514
AND I WAS NERVOUS
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER

06:53.547 --> 06:55.516
CARRIED ANYTHING
SO EXPENSIVE BEFORE.

06:55.549 --> 06:57.951
AND THEY PUT ME IN A CAR
TO KENNEDY AIRPORT.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.487
DID YOU MAKE IT THERE?

06:59.520 --> 07:00.688
YEAH,
TERMINAL FOUR.

07:00.721 --> 07:04.124
UH--AND I MUST HAVE
CHECKED IN MY BAGS

07:04.157 --> 07:06.126
BECAUSE I HAVE
A BOARDING PASS.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.861
DID YOU MAKE IT
THROUGH SECURITY?

07:09.730 --> 07:12.666
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.635
[sighs]

07:14.668 --> 07:17.638
(Morales)
THE AIRLINE VERIFIED KELLY
GOT HER BOARDING PASS.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.840
THEN SECURITY AT KENNEDY
SENT OVER THE TAPES.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.074
KELLY MADE IT
TO HER GATE,

07:21.108 --> 07:22.843
AND SHE'S GOT
THE POUCH WITH THE DIAMONDS.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.879
(Morales)
AFTER THAT, KELLY HEADED
INTO THE LAYOVER LOUNGE.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.548
(Benson)
SHE WENT FOR A DRINK
BEFORE BOARDING.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.016
THAT MUST BE WHEN
SHE GOT DRUGGED.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.485
GOT ANYTHING
FROM THE BAR?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.186
(Morales)
YEAH, THEY HAVE
A CAMERA THERE, TOO.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.523
(Stabler)
WHO IS THAT WITH HER?
THEY LOOK COZY.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.057
THAT COULD BE OUR PERP.
CAN YOU ZOOM IN?

07:37.090 --> 07:38.526
SURE.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.093
(Stabler)
LET'S SEE

07:40.127 --> 07:41.695
IF HE PUTS ANYTHING
INTO HER DRINK.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.570
(Stabler)
HE'S MAKING HIS MOVE.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.639
THEY BLOCKED IT.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.007
(Benson)
CAN YOU FAST-FORWARD
TILL THEY LEAVE?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.043
SHE FINISHED
HER DRINK.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.244
(Stabler)
WELL, IF HE SLIPPED HER
A MICKEY,

07:57.277 --> 07:58.879
SHE'D BE
FEELING SOMETHING BY NOW.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.648
(Benson)
WELL, SHE'S NOT
STUMBLING OUT OF THERE

08:00.681 --> 08:02.650
LIKE SHE WAS DOPED.
DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE HE'S FORCING HER.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.918
IT'S MORE LIKE A LOVE
CONNECTION THAN COERCION.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.220
DO YOU HAVE 'EM
LEAVING THE AIRPORT?

08:07.254 --> 08:09.823
UH, YEAH.
AT THE TERMINAL EXIT.

08:09.857 --> 08:12.826
(Benson)
SHE CHECKED BAGS.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.528
WHY IS SHE LEAVING
WITHOUT 'EM?

08:14.562 --> 08:16.163
700 Gs BUYS A LOT
OF LOUIS VUITTON LUGGAGE

08:16.196 --> 08:17.297
AND PLENTY
TO PUT IN IT.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.766
I SAY WE PULL
THE TAXI'S TRIP CARD,

08:18.799 --> 08:20.601
SEE WHERE HE TOOK HER.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.573
(Eric)
IT WAS A GREAT MASSAGE.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.807
THANKS AGAIN FOR COMING
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.141
REALLY.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.643
(Benson)
WORKIN' OUT
A FEW KINKS?

08:29.677 --> 08:30.811
YEAH, LONG DAY.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.145
CAN I HELP YOU?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.647
DETECTIVE STABLER.

08:33.681 --> 08:34.882
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
DETECTIVE BENSON.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.850
UH, YOU ARE?
ERIC LUTZ.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.819
MR. LUTZ, MAY WE?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.554
YEAH, PLEASE.
COME IN.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.558
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

08:44.592 --> 08:46.694
WELL, TELL US
HOW YOU KNOW KELLY SUN.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.961
I MET HER LAST NIGHT.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.764
(Benson)
REALLY?

08:50.798 --> 08:52.265
'CAUSE YOU LOOK
PRETTY CLOSE.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.334
(Eric)
WELL, WE WERE
GETTING THERE.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.402
YEAH?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.137
YOU TRY TO GET THERE
A LITTLE TOO FAST LAST NIGHT?

08:57.170 --> 08:59.573
HOW IS THAT ANY
OF YOUR BUSINESS?

08:59.607 --> 09:01.008
(Stabler)
KELLY WAS FOUND
THIS MORNING

09:01.041 --> 09:02.676
A COUPLE OF BLOCKS
AWAY FROM HERE.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.311
SHE WAS BRUTALLY ATTACKED.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.979
YOU DON'T THINK
I HURT HER.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.681
I THINK
SHE SAID, "NO,"

09:07.715 --> 09:09.349
BUT YOU WERE REVVED UP TO GO
SO YOU FORCED HER.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.884
ACTUALLY,
KELLY SAID, "YES."

09:10.918 --> 09:13.320
AND WHEN I WOKE UP
SHE WAS GONE.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.055
YOU KNOW,
FOR A LOT OF GIRLS,

09:15.088 --> 09:17.090
THE MORNING AFTER
CAN BE A LITTLE AWKWARD.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.627
ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY
WAKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.694
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.229
SO SHE BEAT HERSELF UP?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.064
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE SHE WAS HEADED HOME

09:24.097 --> 09:25.733
AND SHE GOT JUMPED
BY SOME GUY.

09:25.766 --> 09:27.000
(Eric)
LOOK, I MET
A CUTE GIRL IN A BAR

09:27.034 --> 09:28.268
AND WE HOOKED UP.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.336
THAT'S NOT A CRIME.

09:29.369 --> 09:31.004
NO, BUT ROBBERY IS.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.840
STILL SEALED.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.107
I WOULDN'T GO THROUGH
SOMEBODY ELSE'S THINGS.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.375
AND YOU DON'T
THINK IT'S STRANGE

09:35.408 --> 09:36.276
THAT SHE LEFT IT HERE?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.746
MAYBE SHE USED IT
AS AN EXCUSE TO CALL ME.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.013
YOU KNOW,
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.749
DO YOU PICK UP A LOT
OF WOMEN, MR. LUTZ?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.350
DRUG 'EM, BRING 'EM HOME,
AND THEN ROUGH 'EM UP?

09:43.383 --> 09:46.319
DETECTIVE,
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU,

09:46.353 --> 09:48.188
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
I SHOULD CALL MY LAWYER.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.322
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.625
WE'RE DONE.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.861
YOU CAN'T
JUST TAKE THAT.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.395
YEAH, WE CAN.
IT'S EVIDENCE.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.330
BY THE WAY, YOU SHOULDN'T
LEAVE 700 GRAND OF DIAMONDS

09:57.364 --> 09:58.866
JUST LAYING AROUND.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.034
[door closes]

10:03.436 --> 10:05.038
SO THAT'S A GIRL'S
BEST FRIEND, HUH?

10:05.072 --> 10:06.273
THEY'RE UNCUT.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.108
LOOKS LIKE THE STUFF

10:08.141 --> 10:09.209
AT THE BOTTOM OF
MY SON'S FISHBOWL.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.879
OKAY, IF THOSE WERE KEEPING
DICKIE'S FISH COMPANY,

10:11.912 --> 10:13.180
ALL THREE OF US
COULD RETIRE.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.715
JUST BECAUSE YOU
FOUND THEM AT LUTZ'S PLACE

10:14.748 --> 10:16.383
DOESN'T MEAN
HE STOLE THEM.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.885
BUT IT DOES MEAN
THAT HE WAS WITH KELLY

10:17.918 --> 10:19.386
THE NIGHT OF THE ATTACK.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.854
ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S
PICK HIM UP FOR ROBBERY.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.122
SQUEEZE HIM
FOR THE RAPE.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.390
IF SHE WAS RAPED.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.858
LUTZ SAYS THE SEX
WAS CONSENSUAL.
STABLER.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.193
WHAT ABOUT THE BEAT-DOWN?

10:26.226 --> 10:28.128
YOU THINK KELLY
CONSENTED TO THAT?

10:28.161 --> 10:29.396
WITHOUT A CLAIM OF RAPE,

10:29.429 --> 10:30.330
WE DON'T EVEN HAVE
A "HE SAID, SHE SAID."

10:30.363 --> 10:32.866
AND WHAT IF SHE'S IN
ON THIS ALLEGED ROBBERY?

10:32.900 --> 10:34.134
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THE DIAMONDS.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.302
KIM, THE WOMAN WAS BEATEN.
SHE WAS RAPED.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.236
AND SHE THOUGHT SHE LOST

10:36.269 --> 10:37.771
OVER A HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS IN JEWELS.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.039
SHE WAS SCARED.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.340
BUT SHE WASN'T DRUGGED.

10:40.373 --> 10:41.809
THAT WAS WARNER
WITH THE TOX SCREEN.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.110
NO ROHYPNOL,
NO GHB.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.313
LOOK, I KNOW
THIS GUY RAPED HER.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.848
THEN WHY
CAN'T SHE REMEMBER?

10:47.881 --> 10:48.982
I DON'T KNOW.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.953
MAYBE THE AIRPORT SECURITY
TAPE WILL JOG HER MEMORY.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.757
HEY.
GET AWAY FROM HER.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.827
WHAT ARE YOU, DEAF?
GET UP.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.294
WHOA--JUST MAKING SURE
SHE'S OKAY.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.263
(Eric)
RELAX.
WHO ARE YOU?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.165
IT'S ERIC.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

11:05.198 --> 11:07.334
(Stabler)
HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.302
I TOLD THE NURSE
THAT I WAS HER BOYFRIEND.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.905
BOYFRIEND? I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.273
(Eric)
COME ON.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.141
HE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.343
I THOUGHT WE MADE A CONNECTION,
KELLY.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.846
KELLY.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.781
YOU MET HIM AT
JFK LAST NIGHT.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.182
YOU LEFT WITH HIM.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.451
WHAT?
HOW COULD THAT BE?

11:24.484 --> 11:25.886
DON'T TELL ME
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.091
GET AWAY FROM ME!
(Benson)
KELLY.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.726
ARREST HIM!
HE RAPED ME!

11:32.760 --> 11:34.427
(Kelly)
HE RAPED ME!

11:34.461 --> 11:36.329
[cries]

11:51.979 --> 11:53.213
I DIDN'T RAPE KELLY.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.481
OKAY, WELL, I'M SURE
A GUY LIKE YOU

11:54.514 --> 11:55.448
DOESN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM
GETTIN' LAID.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.950
I JUST NEED TO HEAR
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.218
YES, ANYTHING TO HELP
CLEAR THIS UP.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.220
OKAY, SO YOU MEET KELLY
IN THE BAR AT KENNEDY

12:00.253 --> 12:01.388
AND YOU HAVE A FEW DRINKS.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.223
RIGHT.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.258
AND THEN MY FLIGHT
TO BOGOTA WAS CANCELED.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.526
YOU CAN CHECK THAT
WITH THE AIRLINE.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.995
WE DID.
YOU WERE GROUNDED.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.429
BUT KELLY'S FLIGHT
TOOK OFF

12:09.462 --> 12:10.397
WITHOUT HER ON IT.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.766
YEAH, WELL, WE WERE
GETTIN' ALONG, YOU KNOW.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.201
I SUGGESTED SHE COULD
COME OVER TO MY HOUSE

12:14.234 --> 12:15.468
AND THEN SHE COULD TAKE
A FLIGHT THE NEXT DAY.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.070
PRETTY SMOOTH.
YEAH.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.338
I WAS SURPRISED
WHEN SHE SAID, "YES."

12:18.371 --> 12:20.307
BUT WHO AM I TO SAY NO
TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.842
(Kelly)
I WOULDN'T GO HOME

12:21.875 --> 12:23.443
WITH A COMPLETE STRANGER.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.978
(Benson)
MAYBE HE THREATENED YOU.

12:25.012 --> 12:28.015
BUT THERE'S
SECURITY EVERYWHERE.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.351
WHY DIDN'T I FIGHT BACK
OR SCREAM OR SOMETHING?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.386
SHE WAS TOTALLY INTO ME.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.822
HMM. HMM.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.223
HOW'D YOU FIND KELLY?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.425
YOU SAID SHE WAS ATTACKED
NEAR MY HOUSE.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.393
I JUST CHECKED
THE CLOSEST HOSPITAL--MERCY.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.362
YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW, SHE
WAS JUST A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.831
WHY BOTHER?

12:43.864 --> 12:44.832
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.233
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE WAS OKAY.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.002
YOU KNOW,
SOMEONE MIGHT THINK

12:49.036 --> 12:51.004
THAT YOU JUST WANTED TO SEE
HOW MUCH SHE REMEMBERED.

12:51.038 --> 12:52.372
YEAH, OF COURSE,
I WANTED HER TO REMEMBER

12:52.405 --> 12:54.407
THAT I DIDN'T RAPE HER.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.876
THEN I'D BE OFF THE HOOK.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.110
KEEP WIGGLING.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.478
CSU JUST
CALLED FROM HIS CRIB.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.413
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION
TO SEARCH MY HOUSE.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.315
WE GOT A WARRANT.

13:02.349 --> 13:03.316
YEAH, AND WE FOUND
BLOOD ON YOUR SHEETS.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.552
SAME TYPE AS KELLY'S.
EXPLAIN THAT, PLAYER.

13:05.585 --> 13:08.521
GUYS, COME ON.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.490
IT WAS HER TIME
OF THE MONTH.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.325
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A DEAL-BREAKER FOR ME.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.197
RAPE KIT CONFIRMS
YOUR VICTIM WAS MENSTRUATING.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.465
SON OF A BITCH HAS
AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.133
HE MIGHT NOT
HAVE ONE FOR THIS.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.069
YOU MENTIONED HE WAS
ON HIS WAY TO BOGOTA?

13:22.102 --> 13:24.204
HE'S A PETROLEUM EXEC.
GOES DOWN TO COLOMBIA A LOT.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.538
THAT RANG A BELL.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.008
SO I RE-RAN KELLY'S
TOX SCREEN

13:28.041 --> 13:29.576
FOR A TROPANE ALKALOID
CALLED SCOPOLAMINE

13:29.609 --> 13:31.044
AND HIT THE JACKPOT.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.146
COLOMBIAN
DEVIL'S BREATH.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.448
SCAM ARTISTS USE IT
IN LATIN AMERICA

13:35.482 --> 13:36.950
TO PREY ON PEOPLE.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.218
GET 'EM TO HAND OVER
THEIR LIFE'S SAVINGS.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.920
THE VICTIM STAYS CONSCIOUS
BUT CONTROLLABLE.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.422
SHE MIGHT FIGHT, BUT
SHE'LL DO WHAT SHE'S TOLD.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.024
WELL, EXPLAINS WHY
KELLY SKIPPED HER FLIGHT

13:44.057 --> 13:45.592
AND WENT OFF
WITH A STRANGER.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.294
SCOPOLAMINE ALSO BLOCKS
MEMORY FORMATION.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.429
IT'S NOT THAT YOUR VICTIM
DOESN'T RECALL THE ATTACK.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.464
SHE LITERALLY
HAS NO MEMORY OF IT.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.500
SHE'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.102
WELL, I KNOW WHO CAN.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.503
THE BASTARD
WHO DOSED HER.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.507
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SCOPOLAMINE IS.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.975
THEN YOU WON'T MIND US

14:02.009 --> 14:03.243
GOING THROUGH YOUR
CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS

14:03.276 --> 14:04.311
TO SEE IF YOU'VE
BOUGHT ANY, HUH?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.946
COULD YOU JUST PLEASE HURRY?
I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.280
ARE YOU GOING TO BOGOTA?

14:07.314 --> 14:08.548
YEAH, AND THE CAR'LL
BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.250
I HAVE TO FINISH PACKING.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.518
[both sigh]

14:11.551 --> 14:13.053
WE CANNOT LET THIS GUY
LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.421
THERE'S NOTHING SO FAR
THAT'S GONNA STOP HIM.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.323
I MEAN,
NO VITAMIN COMPANIES,

14:16.356 --> 14:17.290
NO HEALTH FOOD STORE,

14:17.324 --> 14:19.326
NO VENDOR THAT SELLS
ANYTHING LIKE SCOPOLAMINE.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.527
WELL, IF HE USES CASH,

14:20.560 --> 14:21.995
WE'LL NEVER
BE ABLE TO TRACE IT.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.430
I THINK HE CHARGES
EVERYTHING.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.899
NOBU, TIFFANY'S,
BARNEY'S--

14:25.933 --> 14:28.135
GUY'S VICES ARE
FIVE-STAR RESTAURANTS

14:28.168 --> 14:29.469
AND THOUSAND-DOLLAR SHIRTS.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.470
WELL, HE MIGHT
HAVE ANOTHER ONE.

14:30.503 --> 14:31.905
I CHECKED LUTZ'S
INTERNET CACHE

14:31.939 --> 14:33.073
FOR SEARCHES
ON SCOPOLAMINE

14:33.106 --> 14:34.407
AND DIDN'T FIND ANY.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.543
BUT I DID FIND THESE.

14:38.411 --> 14:40.613
HOLDHERDOWN.NET.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.415
SICKSEXVIDEO.NET.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.251
FORCEHER.NET.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.518
(Stabler)
"THESE BITCHES DO

14:45.552 --> 14:46.553
WHAT YOU WANT,
WHEN YOU WANT."

14:46.586 --> 14:48.388
PRINCE CHARMING
LIKES RAPE PORN.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.157
"LIKES" IS
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.491
(Morales)
HE'S GOT MORE THAN
200,000 PICS AND VIDEOS.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.060
THAT'S QUITE A SPANK BANK.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.228
[sighs]
BUT IT DOESN'T PROVE
THAT HE RAPED KELLY.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.696
YOU MIGHT CHANGE YOUR MIND
WHEN YOU SEE THIS.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.066
I FOUND AN ENCRYPTED
PARTITION ON HIS HARD DRIVE.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.301
AN INVISIBLE DRIVE.
EXACTLY.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.369
[Eric on video]
SAY IT.
TELL ME YOU WANT ME.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.703
(Benson)
THAT'S KELLY AND LUTZ.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.238
[Kelly on video]
OH, MY GOD!

15:05.272 --> 15:06.539
AND THAT DOESN'T
LOOK CONSENSUAL.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.941
(Kelly)
I LOVE IT.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.376
(Eric)
SAY I'M THE BOSS.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.512
[struggling, whimpering]
YES, YOU'RE THE BOSS.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.581
YOU JUST FOUND
THE SMOKING GUN.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.549
MORE LIKE A SMOKING ARMORY.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.318
THERE ARE FOUR MORE VIDEOS
OF LUTZ ATTACKING OTHER WOMEN.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.987
(Eric)
TELL ME YOU WANT ME!

15:20.020 --> 15:21.554
(Kelly)
I WANT YOU!

15:21.588 --> 15:24.424
HE'S A SERIAL RAPIST.

15:24.457 --> 15:28.395
[Kelly struggling]
THAT'S RIGHT.
TELL ME YOU WANT IT.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.530
NO, DON'T.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.066
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HE DID TO ME.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.238
[Eric on video]
TELL ME YOU LOVE IT.
SAY IT.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.341
SAY IT.
[Kelly on video]
I LOVE IT.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.609
(Stabler)
FORGOT TO MENTION

15:42.642 --> 15:44.377
YOU'RE
A PHOTOGRAPHY BUFF.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.482
YOUR HOME VIDEOS
LOOK A LITTLE ROUGH.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.051
SOME WOMEN THINK

15:51.084 --> 15:53.386
GETTING PHYSICAL
MAKES IT MORE EXCITING.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.222
FUNNY, THEY DON'T SEEM
TO BE ENJOYING THEMSELVES.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.090
THAT'S JUST
PART OF THE ACT.
MM-HMM.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.491
THEY'RE ROLE-PLAYING
THEIR FANTASIES.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.426
AND YOU PLAY
THE ROLE OF THE RAPIST.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.494
[chuckles]
IS THAT HOW KELLY
REMEMBERS IT?

16:01.528 --> 16:03.463
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL SHE
DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING

16:03.496 --> 16:04.564
'CAUSE YOU DRUGGED HER.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.366
WRONG. SHE ATE IT UP.
THEY ALL DID.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.101
SO YOU'RE SAYING

16:08.135 --> 16:09.469
THESE WOMEN CONSENTED?

16:09.502 --> 16:10.737
(Eric)
ABSOLUTELY.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.272
THEN YOU WON'T MIND
TELLING ME THEIR NAMES.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.007
I DON'T KISS AND TELL.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.775
A GOOD POLICY
ALL-AROUND.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.644
LET'S GO, ERIC.
THIS INTERVIEW'S OVER.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.521
KIM GREYLEK.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.058
FROM THE BELTWAY
TO THE BIG APPLE.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.659
WHATEVER
I CAN TO PROTECT IT

16:32.692 --> 16:34.561
FROM WORMS
LIKE YOUR CLIENT.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.429
YOU BETTER START THINKING
ABOUT PROTECTING YOUR REP

16:36.463 --> 16:38.498
WHEN THE JUDGE
LAUGHS THIS DOG OF A CASE

16:38.531 --> 16:39.566
OUT OF THE COURTROOM.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.034
WE'LL SEE.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.635
ALWAYS NICE TO SEE
LAWYERS GETTING ALONG.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.172
OH, YEAH.
I SAW THE VIDEOS.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.506
SHE'S RIGHT.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.708
LUTZ TELLS KELLY TO FIGHT BACK
AND SHE DOES.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.810
HALF THE JURY'S
GONNA THINK SHE WANTED IT.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.779
YOU'RE NOT LETTING
HIM GO, ARE YOU?

16:52.812 --> 16:54.314
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ENOUGH TO HOLD HIM.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.683
YOU HAVE HIM
RAPING ME ON TAPE.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.151
WHAT MORE
DO YOU NEED?

16:58.185 --> 17:00.387
WE NEED TIME.
TIME TO BUILD A CASE.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.822
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL SAFE.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.592
WHO'S GONNA STOP HIM
FROM DOING THIS AGAIN?

17:05.625 --> 17:07.427
(Greylek)
THE ONLY WAY

17:07.460 --> 17:08.695
WE'RE GONNA NAIL LUTZ

17:08.728 --> 17:10.197
IS IF WE I.D.
THOSE OTHER VICTIMS,

17:10.230 --> 17:12.099
SEE IF THEY
REMEMBER ANYTHING.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.433
SO WE GOT FIVE MILLION
WOMEN IN THIS CITY

17:13.466 --> 17:14.701
AND WE GOTTA FIND
FOUR OF 'EM.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.769
WHO MAY NOT EVEN KNOW
THAT THEY'VE BEEN RAPED.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.707
SAY I'M THE BEST
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.342
LET ME HEAR YOU SAY IT.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.411
SAY I'M THE BEST YOU'VE
EVER HAD. SAY IT. SAY IT!

17:24.444 --> 17:25.178
SAY IT!
(girl)
YOU'RE THE BEST
I'VE EVER HAD.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.479
THAT'S RIGHT.
TELL ME YOU'RE MINE.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.449
TELL ME YOU'RE MINE!

17:29.482 --> 17:31.118
COME ON.
I'M YOURS.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.385
(Huang)
ERIC LUTZ

17:32.419 --> 17:33.720
IS THE CLASSIC
SERIAL RAPIST.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.388
HE'S DEEPLY INSECURE

17:35.422 --> 17:37.124
AND SO HE RAPES WOMEN
TO FEEL POWERFUL.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.258
AND HE'S SMART.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.592
HE NEVER SAYS THEIR NAME
OR ANYTHING THAT WE COULD USE

17:39.626 --> 17:41.261
TO IDENTIFY 'EM.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.329
HE DEPERSONALIZES THEM.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.730
TURNS THEM INTO
PASSIVE SEX OBJECTS.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.465
HE TAKES TOTAL CONTROL
NOT ONLY IN THE MOMENT

17:45.498 --> 17:47.134
BUT FOR THE FUTURE.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.368
EVERY TIME
HE WATCHES THE VIDEO,

17:48.401 --> 17:49.869
HE RELIVES THE RAPES.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.338
[wails, struggles]

17:51.371 --> 17:53.440
COME ON.
COME ON!

17:53.473 --> 17:55.108
[woman wails]

17:55.142 --> 17:57.144
GET OFF ME.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.378
YOU'RE A FIGHTER.
I LIKE THAT A LOT.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.646
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA WIN.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.114
AND YOU KNOW WHY
I'M GONNA WIN?

18:01.148 --> 18:02.315
BECAUSE I'M THE BOSS.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.583
TELL ME I'M THE BOSS.
SAY IT.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.851
YOU'RE THE BOSS.
SAY IT AGAIN.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.120
YOU'RE THE BOSS.
SAY IT AGAIN!

18:07.154 --> 18:08.455
YOU'RE THE BOSS!
THAT'S THE SCOPOLAMINE.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.522
SHE WANTS TO FIGHT BACK,

18:09.556 --> 18:11.324
BUT SHE CAN'T
OVERPOWER THE DRUG.

18:11.358 --> 18:12.725
(Benson)
MAYBE ALL OF THEM
WEREN'T DRUGGED.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.128
MAYBE ONE OF THEM
REMEMBERS.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.396
GET MORALES
TO CLEAN UP THE VIDEO.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.564
WE'LL RELEASE THEIR FACES
TO THE MEDIA

18:17.597 --> 18:18.831
AND GET I.D.s
FOR THE WOMEN.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.400
YOU CAN'T PLASTER THEM
ALL OVER THE NEWS.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.734
THE MEDIA'S NOT
GONNA COOPERATE.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.703
(Benson)
THEY'RE VICTIMS.
ARE YOU SURE?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.206
DID YOU JUST WATCH
THE SAME TAPE THAT I DID?

18:26.239 --> 18:28.775
DOES IT LOOK LIKE RAPE?
YEAH.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.178
DOES IT TURN MY STOMACH?
YOU BET.

18:31.211 --> 18:33.546
BUT LUTZ IS GONNA ARGUE IT
WAS CONSENSUAL RAPE FANTASY.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.482
AND UNTIL WE HAVE
A WOMAN WHO SAYS OTHERWISE,

18:35.515 --> 18:37.484
WE'RE STUCK
WITH HIS VERSION.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.218
YOUR PERP HAS FOUND
THE PERFECT M.O.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.519
HE CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS

18:39.552 --> 18:40.720
AND NOT WORRY
ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.854
(Fin)
MAYBE NOT.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.690
MORALES FOUND EMBEDDED
TIME AND DATE STAMPS

18:43.723 --> 18:45.225
ON THE VIDEOS.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.926
(Stabler)
WELL, THAT'S A START.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.361
IT TELLS US
WHEN HE RAPED 'EM.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.329
(Fin)
HE ALSO CROSS-REFERENCED

18:49.362 --> 18:51.764
THE DATES OF THE ATTACKS
WITH LUTZ'S FINANCIALS

18:51.798 --> 18:53.466
AND SOMETHING
HINKY CAME UP.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.568
TWO HOURS BEFORE
HE RAPED VICTIM TWO,

18:55.602 --> 18:57.604
HE PAID $800
TO EXQUISITE EXPRESS.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.606
SOUNDS LIKE
A LIMOUSINE RENTAL.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.208
OR AN ESCORT SERVICE.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.344
THEY'LL BOTH
TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.379
(female voice)
DO YOU DREAM

19:06.413 --> 19:07.514
ABOUT BEING WITH
THE PERFECT GIRL?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.682
DESCRIBE YOUR IDEAL DATE
AND WE'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.351
(Benson)
BUILD A BIMBO.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.652
THE JOHN CAN PICK ANYTHING

19:12.685 --> 19:14.187
FROM THEIR HAIR COLOR
TO THEIR CUP SIZE.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.822
OKAY,
SO VICTIM NUMBER TWO,

19:15.855 --> 19:18.325
SHE WAS ABOUT, UH, WHAT--
UH, 5'8"?

19:19.526 --> 19:21.328
UH, BLONDE HAIR.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.929
UH, CUP SIZE,
I DON'T KNOW, C?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.331
D.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.366
GOT A GOOD EYE.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.370
[computer beeps]

19:30.403 --> 19:31.571
[beeps]

19:31.604 --> 19:32.872
[chirps]

19:36.409 --> 19:37.844
(Benson)
WE RECOMMEND...

19:37.877 --> 19:39.579
DENISE.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.748
THAT LOOKS LIKE OUR VICTIM.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.927
DENISE?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.397
SORRY, DETECTIVE,
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GIRL.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.931
EH, YOU'RE GOOD.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.967
NO, I'M PRETTY SURE
YOU'RE THE ONE I WANT.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.802
WHAT IS THIS,
A SHAKEDOWN?

20:02.835 --> 20:04.471
NO, IT'S MORE
LIKE RESEARCH.

20:04.504 --> 20:05.738
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME

20:05.772 --> 20:07.006
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS GUY.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.941
(Stabler)
TELL ME ABOUT HIM.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.510
OFF THE RECORD.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.379
JUST YOUR AVERAGE SICKO.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.014
YEAH, I SAW THE VIDEO.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.483
FIGURES HE'D TAPE IT.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.451
HE WAS REALLY
INTO THE ACT.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.520
THE WHOLE, UM,
"NO MEANS YES" THING.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.788
HE FORCE YOU?

20:21.821 --> 20:23.790
FORCE ME?
HE PAID ME.

20:23.823 --> 20:26.493
BUT HE HAD TROUBLES
ON HIS END.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.328
HE COULDN'T
FINISH THE JOB?

20:28.361 --> 20:30.697
HE HAD A HARD TIME
KEEPING HIS INTEREST UP.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.031
(Stabler)
PLAYING MAKE-BELIEVE

20:32.064 --> 20:34.301
WASN'T ENOUGH FOR HIM
TO GET OFF ANYMORE,

20:34.334 --> 20:36.336
SO LUTZ GRADUATES TO
REAL RAPE, REAL VICTIM.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.770
OKAY, SO WE'VE ID'D

20:37.804 --> 20:39.672
VICTIMS TWO AND FIVE.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.508
DENISE AND KELLY SUN.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.476
QUESTION IS, WHO'S
ONE, THREE, AND FOUR?

20:43.510 --> 20:45.412
ALL WE KNOW FROM THE VIDEO
IS THE TIME AND DATES.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.613
(Morales)
NOT ANYMORE.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.281
I DUG DEEPER
THROUGH LUTZ'S RECEIPTS

20:48.315 --> 20:49.382
AND I HEX-DUMPED
HIS CELL PHONE.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.319
HEX-DUMPED?
YEAH, IT'S OUR LATEST
TECHIE TRICK.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.286
A CELL PHONE MEMORY

20:53.320 --> 20:55.422
STORES WHERE YOU ACCESS
WIFI, EMAIL, OR GPS.

20:55.455 --> 20:56.656
GIVES YOU A GOOD IDEA
OF A PERSON'S MOVEMENTS

20:56.689 --> 20:57.857
AROUND THE CITY.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.926
LIKE WHERE LUTZ WAS RIGHT
BEFORE THESE WOMEN WERE RAPED

20:59.959 --> 21:01.060
AND TAPED.

21:01.093 --> 21:01.994
DOWN TO THE SQUARE FOOT.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.162
ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE
NUMBER ONE WAS ATTACKED,

21:03.195 --> 21:05.865
LUTZ MADE AN ATM WITHDRAWAL
AT GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.400
WELL, HE PROBABLY
MET HER THERE.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.868
IN A BAR.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.937
SO HE PICKS UP WOMEN

21:10.970 --> 21:13.039
HAVING DRINKS
IN PUBLIC PLACES.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.140
THAT DOESN'T
HELP US TOO MUCH.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.075
A THOUSAND PEOPLE GO THROUGH
GRAND CENTRAL EVERY DAY.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.478
OKAY, THEN HOW
ABOUT NUMBER THREE?

21:18.511 --> 21:19.379
38 MINUTES
BEFORE SHE WAS RAPED,

21:19.412 --> 21:20.647
LUTZ ACCESSED WIFI
AT A GYM ON 58TH STREET

21:20.680 --> 21:23.550
CALLED
"FITNESS FACTOR."

21:23.583 --> 21:25.952
HE COULD HAVE MET HER AND
DOPED HER IN THE JUICE BAR.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.420
I EMAILED THEM
HER PHOTO.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.388
THEY MATCHED IT TO
THE I.D. OF A MEMBER--

21:28.421 --> 21:29.656
HER NAME
IS LAUREL ANDREWS.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.957
GREAT JOB.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.427
(Benson)
THANKS FOR SEEING US.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.294
(Laurel)
WHAT CAN I DO
FOR THE POLICE?

21:35.328 --> 21:37.330
I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMEBODY

21:37.364 --> 21:39.031
THAT YOU MET
AT THE GYM.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.667
AT FITNESS FACTOR?

21:40.700 --> 21:42.001
I DON'T TALK TO ANYONE
WHILE I WORK OUT.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.836
I JUST PUT IN MY EARBUDS
AND SWEAT TO THE MUSIC.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.705
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THIS MAN?

21:45.738 --> 21:47.640
NO.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.908
WELL, WE THINK
YOU MET HIM AT THE GYM

21:48.941 --> 21:50.343
AND HE ASSAULTED YOU.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.878
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.446
(Benson)
SO YOU DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING?

21:53.480 --> 21:56.516
THERE'S NOTHING TO REMEMBER.
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.987
WE HAVE THE ATTACK
ON VIDEO.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.422
LOOK, I TOLD YOU.
I DON'T KNOW THIS MAN.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.391
AND I WASN'T ATTACKED.

22:04.424 --> 22:05.625
WE BELIEVE THAT
HE DRUGGED YOU

22:05.658 --> 22:07.394
SO YOU WOULDN'T
REMEMBER.

22:07.427 --> 22:08.461
MAYBE IF YOU
SAW THE VIDEO--

22:08.495 --> 22:10.663
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG PERSON.
GO NOW.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.665
WALK AROUND THE BLOCK
PUTS HER OUT EVERY TIME.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.367
I'M SORRY, HONEY,

22:14.401 --> 22:15.635
I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU HAD GUESTS.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.770
HELLO, MR. ANDREWS.
WE'RE JUST LEAVING.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.808
[clears throat]

22:21.841 --> 22:23.443
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.513
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

22:26.546 --> 22:28.481
SHE'S THE SAME
HAPPY WIFE AND MOTHER

22:28.515 --> 22:29.949
SHE WAS BEFORE
AUGUST 19TH.

22:29.982 --> 22:31.418
IT WAS LIKE
SHE WAS NEVER RAPED.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.752
BUT SHE WAS.
WE HAVE IT ON TAPE.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.521
RIGHT NOW, THAT WOMAN
IS NOT A VICTIM.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.022
IF WE PLAY HER THAT TAPE,
WE'RE MAKING HER ONE.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.890
IF WE PRETEND
THAT WOMAN WASN'T ATTACKED,

22:37.924 --> 22:39.426
THEN LUTZ
GETS AWAY WITH IT.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.593
AND WHEN HE RAPES
HIS NEXT VICTIM,

22:40.627 --> 22:42.529
THAT'LL BE ON US.

22:42.562 --> 22:46.065
SO WE FIND
VICTIM NUMBER FOUR

22:46.098 --> 22:48.535
AND SEE IF SHE REMEMBERS.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.869
(Greylek)
ANY LUCK?

22:49.902 --> 22:51.137
(Benson)
I WISH.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.805
LUTZ ATTACKED
VICTIM NUMBER FOUR

22:52.839 --> 22:54.941
30 MINUTES AFTER HE ATE AT
THE NORMANDY CAFE.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.943
OKAY, LET'S SEE IF
ANYONE THERE CAN I.D. HER.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.178
CHANGED HANDS SIX MONTHS
AFTER THE OWNER DIED.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.847
SO WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.148
(Stabler)
STILL GOT
LAUREL ANDREWS.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.517
GREAT, LET'S GET
HER ON BOARD.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.453
WE TRIED.
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

23:06.486 --> 23:07.687
(Stabler)
LAUREL WAS LUTZ'S
FIRST VICTIM

23:07.720 --> 23:09.522
AFTER HE COULDN'T
GET IT UP WITH DENISE,

23:09.556 --> 23:11.190
SO MAYBE HE HADN'T PERFECTED
HIS DRUGGING TECHNIQUE.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.959
OKAY, SHOW HER THE VIDEO.
SHE MIGHT REMEMBER SOMETHING.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.461
SHE REFUSES
TO LOOK AT IT.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.028
CHANGE HER MIND.
CONVINCE HER.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.764
I'M NOT GONNA
TURN HER INTO A VICTIM

23:17.797 --> 23:19.031
TO TEST OUT
YOUR THEORY.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.567
YOU'RE GIVING
A SERIAL RAPIST

23:20.600 --> 23:21.901
LICENSE TO
PREY ON MORE WOMEN.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.737
NO. PUT A TAIL ON HIM SO
HE CAN'T HURT ANYONE ELSE.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.607
ELLIOT, WE CAN'T JUST

23:27.640 --> 23:29.542
LET THIS GUY WALK.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.215
DETECTIVE.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.550
DID YOU FIND
LAUREL'S PURSE?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.452
HER PURSE?

23:39.486 --> 23:41.120
SHE SAID IT WAS STOLEN.
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE HERE.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.793
MR. ANDREWS, I WORK WITH
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

23:46.826 --> 23:50.229
WE INVESTIGATE SEX CRIMES.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.998
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.700
LOOK...

23:53.733 --> 23:56.002
I NEED YOU
TO SEE SOMETHING.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.937
TELL ME I'M THE BOSS.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.472
YOU'RE THE BOSS.
SAY IT AGAIN.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.073
YOU'RE THE BOSS.
SAY IT AGAIN!

24:01.107 --> 24:02.542
[crying]
YOU'RE THE BOSS!

24:02.575 --> 24:05.077
[Laurel
exclaims, cries]

24:08.915 --> 24:10.249
WHY DIDN'T
LAUREL TELL ME?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.051
SHE SAYS
SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.686
[sighs]

24:13.720 --> 24:14.954
BUT WHY LIE TO ME

24:14.987 --> 24:16.823
AFTER YOU TOLD HER
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:16.856 --> 24:18.491
[sniffs]

24:18.525 --> 24:20.627
MAYBE SHE WAS
AFRAID TO FACE IT

24:20.660 --> 24:21.961
OR AFRAID OF WHAT
YOU MIGHT THINK.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.030
(Laurel)
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

24:28.568 --> 24:30.136
OH, MY GOD.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.004
THAT'S ME.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.879
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

24:39.912 --> 24:41.280
I WAS THINKING ABOUT

24:41.313 --> 24:42.214
GETTING A SERIAL RAPIST
OFF THE STREET.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.883
I WANT TO CATCH THE GUY
AS MUCH AS YOU DO,

24:43.916 --> 24:45.117
BUT WHAT ABOUT
LAUREL ANDREWS?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.787
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU SAID

24:47.820 --> 24:49.188
CONFRONTING THE ATTACKER
IS THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE ON?

24:49.221 --> 24:50.723
LAUREL DOESN'T
HAVE TO MOVE ON.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.291
IN HER MIND,
SHE WASN'T EVEN RAPED.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.260
LUTZ WILL LEARN
FROM HIS MISTAKES.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.762
HE'LL IMPROVE HIS M.O.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.296
THEN WE'LL NEVER GET HIM.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.898
YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED TO LAUREL.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.933
I CAN PROTECT HER
FROM THE DAMAGE.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.268
NO. YOU CAN'T.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.236
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.984
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

25:18.017 --> 25:22.021
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING, LAUREL.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.590
JUST LISTEN.

25:27.927 --> 25:31.097
A FEW MONTHS AGO,
I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED

25:31.130 --> 25:33.766
BY A MAN WHILE
I WAS WORKING UNDERCOVER.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.570
I FELT GUILTY

25:37.604 --> 25:39.606
THAT I DIDN'T STOP HIM.

25:39.639 --> 25:44.310
ASHAMED OF HOW
POWERLESS I WAS.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.346
AND THEN I GOT ANGRY.

25:47.379 --> 25:52.184
BUT THAT DIDN'T
HELP ME GET OVER IT.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.986
WHAT DID?

25:54.020 --> 25:58.725
ADMITTING
THAT IT HAD HAPPENED.

25:58.758 --> 26:02.862
AND PUTTING THE MAN
WHO DID IT BEHIND BARS.

26:02.895 --> 26:06.565
AND GOING TO COUNSELING.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.271
ARE YOU OVER IT NOW?

26:15.675 --> 26:20.079
I'LL NEVER BE OVER IT.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.716
BUT I CAN
LIVE WITH IT NOW.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.253
AND I HAVE MY LIFE
BACK NOW.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.929
I MET HIM AT THE JUICE BAR
AT THE GYM.

26:39.231 --> 26:40.767
AND THE NEXT THING
I REMEMBER,

26:40.800 --> 26:42.368
I WAS WAKING UP AT HOME,

26:42.401 --> 26:44.170
SORE, WITH MY LEGS
ALL BRUISED.

26:44.203 --> 26:48.941
YOU DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT HE DID TO YOU?

26:53.345 --> 26:55.281
AFTER YOU FIRST
CAME TO SEE ME,

26:55.314 --> 26:57.016
I STARTED TO.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.918
BITS AND PIECES.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.220
OF HIM HOLDING ME DOWN.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.322
TEARING OFF MY CLOTHES.

27:04.991 --> 27:07.694
DID HE RAPE YOU?

27:10.262 --> 27:13.332
YES.

27:13.365 --> 27:17.103
AND I JUST
COULDN'T FACE IT.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.171
LAUREL.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.340
I NEED YOU TO TESTIFY.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.180
IF I DO, WILL
HE GO TO PRISON?

27:28.214 --> 27:32.118
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO STOP HIM.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.030
NO, NOT SO FAST
THERE, MR. LUTZ.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.765
YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE ME
MISS MY FLIGHT AGAIN, ARE YA?

27:45.798 --> 27:46.933
THAT'S NOT ALL
YOU'RE GONNA MISS.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.168
ERIC LUTZ,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

27:49.201 --> 27:52.071
FOR THE RAPES OF KELLY SUN
AND LAUREL ANDREWS.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.372
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.974
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

27:55.007 --> 27:56.308
IN A COURT OF LAW.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.509
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY.

27:57.543 --> 27:59.746
IF YOU CANNOT AFFORD ONE,
ONE WILL BE APPOINTED TO YOU.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.983
PEOPLE OF THE STATE
OF NEW YORK VERSUS ERIC LUTZ.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.018
TWO COUNTS OF RAPE
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.286
HOW DOES
THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

28:07.319 --> 28:08.921
NOT GUILTY,
YOUR HONOR.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.189
(Judge Moredock)
BAIL?

28:10.222 --> 28:11.457
THE PEOPLE
REQUEST $2 MILLION.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.192
THE DEFENDANT
WAS ARRESTED

28:13.225 --> 28:14.794
ON HIS WAY
TO JET OFF TO COLOMBIA.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.128
ON A LONG-OVERDUE
BUSINESS TRIP

28:16.162 --> 28:17.229
WHICH A.D.A. GREYLEK
KNOWS FULL WELL.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.198
SHE'S MANIPULATING
THE COURT.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.033
AND YOU WOULD
NEVER DO THAT,

28:21.067 --> 28:22.168
WOULD YOU, HILARY?

28:22.201 --> 28:23.770
BAIL IS SET
AT $500,000

28:23.803 --> 28:26.205
AND THE DEFENDANT
WILL SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.907
(Regnier)
YOUR HONOR, MOTION
TO SEVER THE CASES.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.209
PARADING THE DEFENDANT'S
SEXUAL PARTNERS

28:30.242 --> 28:33.079
BEFORE THE COURT
IS HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.313
(Greylek)
THEY'RE NOT
HIS SEXUAL PARTNERS.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.015
THEY'RE HIS RAPE VICTIMS

28:36.048 --> 28:37.950
AND ESTABLISH
A PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR.

28:37.984 --> 28:38.785
THIS PATTERN OVERWHELMS

28:38.818 --> 28:40.319
MY CLIENT'S
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.821
HE'LL BE INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

28:41.854 --> 28:43.956
IN MY COURTROOM.

28:43.990 --> 28:46.759
MOTION TO SEVER
IS DENIED.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.227
MY CLIENT WOULD LIKE
TO CHANGE HIS PLEA

28:48.260 --> 28:51.163
TO NOT GUILTY BY REASON
OF MENTAL DISEASE OR DEFECT.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.298
ON WHAT GROUNDS?

28:52.331 --> 28:53.465
HE'S ADDICTED
TO PORNOGRAPHY.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.868
(Greylek)
WATCHING PORN

28:55.902 --> 28:57.336
IS NOT
AN EXCUSE TO RAPE.

28:57.369 --> 28:58.437
BEING BRAINWASHED IS.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.072
MY CLIENT'S ABILITY

29:00.106 --> 29:03.109
TO UNDERSTAND
RIGHT FROM WRONG

29:03.142 --> 29:05.177
WAS DAMAGED AFTER WATCHING
THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF WOMEN

29:05.211 --> 29:08.147
WHO APPEAR TO ENJOY
BEING FORCED TO HAVE SEX.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.448
(Judge Moredock)
FASCINATING.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.250
AND REPUGNANT.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.185
BUT LEGALLY ACCEPTABLE.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.353
I'LL ALLOW THE DEFENSE.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.855
[bangs gavel]

29:17.589 --> 29:19.191
JUST LIKE THAT?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.493
THE JUDGE DIDN'T EVEN
WANT TO READ THE MOTION?

29:21.527 --> 29:23.029
NOPE.
PORN MADE ME DO IT.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.396
UNBELIEVABLE.
BUT IS IT?

29:24.430 --> 29:26.365
I CAN'T COUNT THE NUMBER
OF PERPS THAT WE'VE COLLARED

29:26.398 --> 29:27.900
WITH PORN STASHES

29:27.934 --> 29:29.301
THAT WOULD MAKE
JENNA JAMESON GAG.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.370
AND THAT AIN'T EASY.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.972
WAIT, SO YOU THINK THAT
GIVES LUTZ AN EXCUSE?

29:33.005 --> 29:34.373
NO, BUT YOU
CAN'T TELL ME

29:34.406 --> 29:35.875
THAT THERE'S NO CONNECTION
BETWEEN PORN AND RAPE.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.143
(Fin)
WHOA, WHOA.
HOLD UP.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.879
I'VE ENJOYED ADULT
ENTERTAINMENT A TIME OR TWO,

29:39.912 --> 29:41.147
AND I'VE NEVER
FORCED A WOMAN.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.882
SO AFTER WHAT WE SEE
ALL DAY, YOU GO HOME

29:42.915 --> 29:44.984
AND WATCH WOMEN BEING
DEGRADED TO GET OFF?

29:45.017 --> 29:48.087
ALL WOMEN DON'T FEEL THE SAME
WAY YOU DO ABOUT PORN.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.421
(Fin)
I MEAN, MY GIRL DIGS IT.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.190
PLUS YOU GOT
FEMALE PRODUCERS

29:51.223 --> 29:53.192
RUNNING MULTIMILLION DOLLAR
PORN PRODUCTION COMPANIES.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.460
WOMEN MAKING PORN?

29:54.493 --> 29:55.928
THAT'S LIKE THE WHORE
ON THE CORNER

29:55.962 --> 29:57.263
WORKING HER WAY
UP TO PIMP.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.230
DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT.

29:58.264 --> 29:59.966
LIGHTEN UP, CHOIRBOY.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.600
(Fin)
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
A PERV TO LIKE PORN.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.135
OH, YEAH?

30:03.169 --> 30:05.037
THEN HOW COME PEOPLE
DON'T PUT V FOR VAGINA

30:05.071 --> 30:06.205
NEXT TO VERTIGO
ON THEIR BOOKSHELVES?

30:06.238 --> 30:07.473
'CAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID
OF BEING JUDGED

30:07.506 --> 30:09.141
BY PRUDES LIKE YOU.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.442
[scoffs]

30:10.476 --> 30:11.610
EVEN HOCKEY MOMS ARE GETTING
BRAZILIAN BIKINI WAXES

30:11.643 --> 30:12.945
TO LOOK LIKE CENTERFOLDS.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.113
PORN IS MAINSTREAM NOW.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.282
BUT KIM,
THIS IS MY POINT.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.918
PORN MAKES NORMAL WOMEN
WANT TO EMULATE HOOKERS

30:18.951 --> 30:20.352
AND TELLS RAPISTS THAT THEIR
SICK FANTASIES ARE OKAY.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.022
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE
FOR ALL RAPISTS.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.356
WELL, IT IS FOR
ENOUGH OF THEM.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.993
(Greylek)
I JUST HOPE THE JURY

30:27.026 --> 30:29.228
ISN'T SNOWED BY
LUTZ'S EXPERT WITNESS.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.967
40 MILLION AMERICANS
ENJOY PORNOGRAPHY

30:35.001 --> 30:36.368
EVERY YEAR.

30:36.402 --> 30:38.437
YOU'D BE HARD PRESSED

30:38.470 --> 30:40.172
TO FIND SOMEONE
IN THIS COURTROOM

30:40.206 --> 30:42.875
WHO HASN'T ENJOYED
A SKIN FLICK OR TWO.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.576
DR. CROSTHWAITE,
HOW CAN WATCHING IMAGES

30:44.610 --> 30:46.112
AFFECT US?

30:46.145 --> 30:48.314
MY RESEARCH SHOWS

30:48.347 --> 30:51.183
THAT PORN TRIGGERS
A CHEMICAL RESPONSE.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.920
ADRENALINE LEVELS
INCREASE.

30:53.953 --> 30:55.187
DOPAMINE
AND SEROTONIN,

30:55.221 --> 30:56.588
THE FEEL-GOOD
NEUROCHEMICALS, SKYROCKET.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.391
BUT IMAGES AREN'T DRUGS.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.393
NO, BUT THE CHEMICAL
RESPONSE TO THOSE IMAGES

31:01.427 --> 31:03.062
CAN BE AS ADDICTIVE
AS A DRUG.

31:03.095 --> 31:06.198
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT A PORN ADDICT

31:06.232 --> 31:08.935
CAN GET HOOKED ON HIS
BRAIN'S OWN CHEMISTRY?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.202
YES.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.671
YOUR CLIENT WATCHED
THOUSANDS OF HOURS

31:12.704 --> 31:14.240
OF VIOLENT PORN,

31:14.273 --> 31:15.574
DRIVING HIM TO ACT OUT
HIS FANTASIES.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.509
(Regnier)
THANK YOU.
NOTHING FURTHER.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.111
DR. CROSTHWAITE,

31:19.145 --> 31:20.546
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES

31:20.579 --> 31:23.382
OF DIAMOND AND UCHIYAMA
IN JAPAN?

31:23.415 --> 31:24.616
AND KUTCHINSKY IN
EUROPE AND SCANDINAVIA?

31:24.650 --> 31:26.085
YES.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.920
PLEASE TELL US
THEIR CONCLUSIONS.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.388
BOTH STUDIES FOUND
THAT AN INCREASE

31:29.421 --> 31:32.258
IN THE AVAILABILITY
OF PORNOGRAPHY

31:32.291 --> 31:33.592
POSITIVELY CORRELATED

31:33.625 --> 31:36.963
TO A DECREASE
IN SEXUAL ASSAULTS.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.598
IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN PORN
IS EASILY AVAILABLE,

31:39.631 --> 31:42.068
FEWER RAPES HAPPEN.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.170
THAT'S RIGHT.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.238
SO SHOULDN'T PORNOGRAPHY
HAVE AN OPPOSITE EFFECT

31:46.272 --> 31:47.439
ON THE DEFENDANT?

31:47.473 --> 31:50.109
NOT NECESSARILY.
REALLY?

31:50.142 --> 31:53.345
THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.581
PORN IS AN OUTLET
FOR FANTASIES

31:55.614 --> 31:57.483
AND DECREASES
THE URGE TO RAPE.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.718
THAT'S TRUE,
BUT IN THIS--
NOTHING FURTHER.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.521
YOUR HONOR, MS. GREYLEK
ASKED OUR EXPERT A QUESTION.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.190
WHY NOT
LET HER ANSWER IT?

32:04.223 --> 32:06.025
GO AHEAD, DOCTOR.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.296
PORN IS LIKE ALCOHOL.

32:10.329 --> 32:13.232
SOME PEOPLE CAN
CONSUME IT SAFELY

32:13.265 --> 32:14.400
IN MODERATION.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.969
GIVE AN ALCOHOLIC A DRINK,

32:17.003 --> 32:19.171
AND HE CAN'T
STOP AT ONE.

32:19.205 --> 32:22.374
MR. LUTZ

32:22.408 --> 32:24.610
NEEDS REHAB.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.312
NOT PRISON.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.747
(Eric)
PORN RUINED MY LIFE.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.983
I'D STAY UP FOR HOURS,

32:31.017 --> 32:33.519
SEARCHING FOR
THE PERFECT IMAGES

32:33.552 --> 32:35.054
SO I COULD--

32:35.087 --> 32:36.255
MASTURBATE.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.557
YEAH,
I DID IT AT NIGHT

32:38.590 --> 32:40.159
SO I COULD SLEEP.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.360
I DID IT
IN THE MORNING

32:41.393 --> 32:42.694
BEFORE I WENT TO WORK.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.396
PRETTY SOON I WAS SNEAKING
PEEKS AT THE OFFICE.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.531
I COULDN'T STOP.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.399
(Regnier)
DID YOU TRY TO QUIT?

32:47.433 --> 32:48.567
(Eric)
YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.102
BUT MY HANDS WERE
SHAKING, YOU KNOW?

32:50.136 --> 32:52.604
IRRITABLE.
UH, I COULDN'T CONCENTRATE.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.640
IT WAS LIKE
GOING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.242
TELL US
ABOUT THE VIDEOS.

32:56.275 --> 33:00.746
THEY WERE DIFFICULT
TO WATCH.

33:00.779 --> 33:03.349
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING

33:03.382 --> 33:04.683
WHEN YOU WERE
WITH THESE WOMEN?

33:04.716 --> 33:08.387
(Eric)
THAT THEY WENT HOME
WITH ME.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.089
THAT THEY WANTED
TO HAVE SEX.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.290
I THOUGHT THEY
WERE INTO IT.

33:11.323 --> 33:15.027
LOOK, I'M SO SORRY
IF I HURT ANYBODY.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.228
I'M IN THERAPY NOW.

33:16.262 --> 33:19.165
AND I'M TRYING
TO RECOVER

33:19.198 --> 33:20.466
FROM THIS
TERRIBLE ADDICTION.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.202
(Regnier)
I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT
THIS HAS BEEN, ERIC.

33:23.235 --> 33:26.405
I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR.

33:26.438 --> 33:27.773
I DON'T GET IT.

33:27.806 --> 33:30.076
YOU'RE HANDSOME.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.543
WELL-EDUCATED.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.279
YOU HAVE A GOOD JOB,
MONEY.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.047
WHY'D YOU GET INTO PORN?

33:35.081 --> 33:37.449
NOT GOOD
IN THE SACK?

33:37.483 --> 33:39.285
OBJECTION.
RELEVANCE.

33:39.318 --> 33:40.686
MR. LUTZ PUT
HIS SEXUAL PROWESS

33:40.719 --> 33:42.754
AND PROCLIVITIES
ON THE TABLE.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.323
OBJECTION OVERRULED.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.391
THE KNIFE
CUTS BOTH WAYS,

33:45.424 --> 33:47.226
MS. REGNIER.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.360
(Greylek)
SO WHY LOOK AT PORN

33:48.394 --> 33:49.795
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

33:49.828 --> 33:51.763
WHAT TICKLED
YOUR FANCY?

33:51.797 --> 33:53.299
GIRL ON GIRL?

33:53.332 --> 33:55.134
DOUBLE PENETRATION?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.435
GAY FOR PAY?

33:56.468 --> 33:58.804
HEY.
I'M INTO WOMEN.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.573
BUT YOU COULDN'T GET A REAL,
LIVE WOMAN WILLINGLY.

34:01.607 --> 34:03.142
SURE I COULD.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.211
BUT PORN

34:05.244 --> 34:07.179
TAKES AWAY
THE COMPLICATIONS.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.280
COMPLICATIONS?

34:08.314 --> 34:09.581
LIKE A WOMAN'S NEEDS
AND DESIRES?

34:09.615 --> 34:12.484
HELL, YOU ALL WANT TO
GET MARRIED AND HAVE KIDS.

34:12.518 --> 34:16.122
SO YOU WANTED SEX
WITH NO STRINGS ATTACHED.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.389
YES.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.691
SEX WITH A WOMAN
YOU COULD PIN DOWN,

34:19.725 --> 34:22.328
PUSH UP HER SKIRT,
YANK OFF HER PANTIES,

34:22.361 --> 34:23.595
AND FORCE
YOURSELF ONTO?

34:23.629 --> 34:25.531
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.367
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
COMPLICATIONS OR PORN.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.801
IT'S THE FIGHT
THAT TURNS YOU ON.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.171
NO, IT IS NOT.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.606
REALLY? LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.378
[Eric on video]
NOW I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANT.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.413
[Laurel on video]
DON'T. I HAVE A HUSBAND,
A BABY.

34:41.447 --> 34:43.649
GOOD, THEN YOU'RE
USED TO PUTTING OUT.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.352
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.554
[Eric laughs]
[Laurel
inhales shakily]

34:48.587 --> 34:52.124
TELL ME YOU LOVE IT.
I LOVE IT.

34:52.158 --> 34:53.592
TELL ME YOU LOVE IT.
TELL ME YOU LOVE IT!

34:53.625 --> 34:56.395
[gasping]
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT.
I WANT YOU.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.863
GET OFF ME!

34:57.896 --> 35:00.599
[crying, wailing]
NO! YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS!

35:00.632 --> 35:01.867
NO, TURN IT OFF.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.402
YOU'RE GETTING
TOO TURNED ON?

35:03.435 --> 35:04.670
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

35:04.703 --> 35:05.637
YOU LIKE IT,
DON'T YOU, MR. LUTZ?

35:05.671 --> 35:08.840
THE FEEL OF A WOMAN
STRUGGLING BENEATH YOU.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.342
THE SOBBING, THE SLAPPING,
THE FIGHT THEY PUT UP?

35:10.376 --> 35:12.244
I SAID, TURN IT OFF!

35:12.278 --> 35:14.446
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

35:14.480 --> 35:18.350
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT
AN OBJECTION YOU'RE RAISING.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.434
GREYLEK TELLS ME
LUTZ IS GOING DOWN

35:35.467 --> 35:37.503
FOR WHAT POPPED UP
IN COURT TODAY.

35:37.536 --> 35:38.937
I GUESS THE JURY SAW HIM

35:38.970 --> 35:40.372
FOR THE MONSTER
THAT HE IS, HUH?

35:40.406 --> 35:41.640
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU DON'T LOOK HAPPY.

35:41.673 --> 35:42.841
I'M NOT--GREYLEK
JUST PUT LAUREL ANDREWS

35:42.874 --> 35:44.310
THROUGH THE WRINGER
FOR NOTHING.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.178
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

35:46.212 --> 35:48.447
LOOK AT THIS.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.649
[squealing]

35:50.682 --> 35:52.351
OH, FLIPPER LOOKS
A LITTLE FRISKY THERE.

35:52.384 --> 35:53.919
SO WHAT?
IT'S ON JUDGE MOREDOCK'S
FILE SERVER.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.422
ALONG WITH OTHER SUGGESTIVE
IMAGES, LIKE A RANDY GOAT.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.689
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

35:57.723 --> 35:59.291
OF A CASE THAT HE'S
TRYING INVOLVING PORN.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.759
WELL, SOMEONE'S GUNNING
FOR HIM, HUH?
OR US.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.794
EITHER WAY,
THIS COMES OUT,

36:02.828 --> 36:04.396
HIS OBJECTIVITY
GETS CALLED INTO QUESTION

36:04.430 --> 36:05.464
AND TRIGGERS A MISTRIAL.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.433
WE'VE GOTTA TELL GREYLEK.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.301
LUTZ WILL WALK
BECAUSE JUDGE MOREDOCK

36:09.335 --> 36:10.469
GETS A LAUGH
FROM RAUNCHY PICTURES.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.903
[sighs]

36:11.937 --> 36:16.542
ANONYMOUS EMAIL,
MY LEFT CHEEK.

36:16.575 --> 36:20.612
IT'S THAT IDIOT LAW CLERK
I FIRED LAST YEAR,

36:20.646 --> 36:22.281
TRYING TO MAKE
TROUBLE FOR ME.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.350
I HAVE TO TURN THEM
OVER TO THE DEFENSE.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.618
THESE WERE NEVER MEANT
FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION.

36:26.652 --> 36:30.422
THEY'RE GOOFY PICTURES.

36:30.456 --> 36:32.758
THEY WERE ON MY PERSONAL
FILE SERVER, NOT A WEBSITE.

36:32.791 --> 36:34.493
WELL, WE FOUND THEM.
THAT MEANS OTHERS CAN TOO.

36:34.526 --> 36:38.664
DO YOU THINK
THESE ARE OBSCENE?

36:38.697 --> 36:39.998
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I THINK.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.768
IF THIS COMES OUT
AFTER THE TRIAL,

36:42.801 --> 36:44.403
THE DEFENSE HAS
GROUNDS FOR APPEAL.

36:44.436 --> 36:48.440
WHICH I WOULD NEVER WANT.

36:48.474 --> 36:52.244
I'M RECUSING MYSELF
AND DECLARING A MISTRIAL.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.281
DETECTIVE BENSON.
MM-HMM.

36:55.314 --> 36:56.815
[slaps]

36:56.848 --> 36:58.617
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN?

36:58.650 --> 37:00.386
[sighs]

37:00.419 --> 37:03.455
IT WAS MY DUTY
TO TURN THOSE PHOTOS OVER.

37:03.489 --> 37:05.524
I THOUGHT YOUR DUTY WAS
TO PROTECT VICTIMS LIKE ME.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.858
BELIEVE ME, LAUREL.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.394
THE LAST THING
THAT I WANT TO DO

37:08.427 --> 37:09.495
IS TO HURT YOUR CASE.

37:09.528 --> 37:12.331
YOU MADE ME REMEMBER!

37:12.364 --> 37:14.766
RELIVE THAT AWFUL NIGHT,

37:14.800 --> 37:16.435
AND NOW,
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

37:16.468 --> 37:17.836
I WILL NEVER GET
THOSE HORRIBLE IMAGES

37:17.869 --> 37:19.305
OUT OF MY HEAD.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.006
I'M S--

37:21.039 --> 37:22.874
AND I WON'T TESTIFY
AGAIN.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.016
YOU OKAY?

37:32.718 --> 37:34.553
NO.

37:38.957 --> 37:40.759
LIV, GO HOME.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.294
I CAN'T.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.330
WITHOUT LAUREL'S TESTIMONY,

37:44.363 --> 37:45.631
I DON'T HAVE A CASE.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.865
THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING THAT I CAN FIND

37:46.898 --> 37:48.334
TO GET LUTZ.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.336
IF THE ANSWER
IS IN THIS BOX,

37:50.369 --> 37:51.603
IT'LL STILL BE THERE
IN THE MORNING.

37:51.637 --> 37:53.772
I GOT THIS RECEIPT
FROM TIFFANY'S

37:53.805 --> 37:55.040
FOR $18,000

37:55.073 --> 37:57.376
ONE MONTH
BEFORE THE RAPE.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.077
DOESN'T SAY
WHAT IT'S FOR.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.513
WHAT DOES A GUY LIKE LUTZ
SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY ON?

38:01.547 --> 38:04.950
HAVE TO BE SOME
PRETTY FANCY CUFFLINKS.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.290
OR AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.560
SON OF A BITCH

38:14.593 --> 38:17.429
WAS GONNA GET MARRIED.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.736
WHO WAS SHE, ERIC?

38:24.770 --> 38:26.405
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:26.438 --> 38:29.107
JUST ASKING YOU
A QUESTION.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.877
YOU'RE TRYING
TO INTIMIDATE ME.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.345
A WOMAN WALKS
DOWN A PUBLIC STREET

38:33.379 --> 38:34.446
AND YOU FIND THAT
INTIMIDATING?

38:34.480 --> 38:35.714
INTERESTING.

38:35.747 --> 38:38.384
CUT THE CRAP, DETECTIVE.
THIS IS HARASSMENT.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.651
SHE WAS YOUR FIRST VICTIM,

38:39.685 --> 38:41.387
BUT SHE WASN'T
A RANDOM STRANGER.

38:41.420 --> 38:42.988
YOU WERE GONNA MARRY HER.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.056
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH THIS.

38:45.090 --> 38:46.124
OH, YEAH?

38:46.157 --> 38:47.125
YEAH.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.795
YOU JUST LOVE TAKING
PHOTOS OF WOMEN, DON'T YOU?

38:49.828 --> 38:51.497
YEAH, I'M GONNA
HAVE YOUR BADGE.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.332
YEAH? NOT BEFORE
I THROW YOU IN JAIL.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.615
HEY, HE TAKE THE BAIT?
(Morales)
YOU BET.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.450
HE MADE A PHONE CALL

39:11.483 --> 39:13.351
AND I'M TRACING
HER NAME AND ADDRESS.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.793
(Regnier)
YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO

39:21.827 --> 39:23.929
THAT DETECTIVE BENSON
CROSSED THE LINE.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.997
SHE STALKED AND
HARASSED MY CLIENT.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.434
FUNNY,
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

39:28.467 --> 39:30.035
SIDEWALKS
WERE PUBLIC PROPERTY.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.437
OH, CUT THE ATTITUDE,
SWEETHEART.

39:31.470 --> 39:33.171
WE'VE GOT THE PROOF
IN THE PHOTOS.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.773
AND I'VE GOT THE PROOF
IN THE FLESH.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.643
SHANNON BROWNING.

39:37.676 --> 39:40.546
MR. LUTZ'S
FORMER FIANCEE.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.147
I'M NOT SURE WHAT SOMEONE
IN MY CLIENT'S PAST

39:42.180 --> 39:43.682
HAS DO DO WITH--

39:43.715 --> 39:45.717
THEN LET MS. BROWNING
DESCRIBE THE PHONE CALL

39:45.751 --> 39:48.186
THAT YOUR CLIENT
MADE TO HER LAST NIGHT.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.655
HOW HE THREATENED
TO KILL HER

39:49.688 --> 39:51.457
IF SHE SAID ANYTHING
TO THE POLICE

39:51.490 --> 39:52.624
ABOUT WHAT HE DID
TO HER TWO YEARS AGO.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.931
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

40:01.967 --> 40:04.470
ERIC PICKED ME UP
AT GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

40:04.503 --> 40:08.740
SAID IT WAS GOING
TO BE A SPECIAL DAY.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.142
ON THE WAY HOME,
HE PROPOSED.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.612
HE GAVE ME
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL RING.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.849
AND THEN WHEN WE GOT BACK
TO HIS PLACE,

40:17.883 --> 40:20.185
HE RAPED ME
OVER AND OVER

40:20.218 --> 40:22.921
AND OVER.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.523
(Greylek)
YOU LOOK SURPRISED, HILARY.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.925
JUST THINK HOW
THE NEXT JURY WILL REACT.

40:26.958 --> 40:28.159
YOU UNGRATEFUL BITCH.

40:28.193 --> 40:29.995
YOU KNOW I'D HAVE
GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.763
ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS BE A LOVING WIFE.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.131
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

40:33.164 --> 40:34.933
AND TO ALL OF THOSE
OTHER WOMEN TOO?

40:34.966 --> 40:36.067
YOU REMEMBER LAUREL,
RIGHT?

40:36.101 --> 40:38.103
AND KELLY?

40:38.136 --> 40:40.171
[scoffs]
YOU SLUTS LOVED IT.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.973
(Regnier)
ERIC, SHUT UP.
WHAT?

40:43.542 --> 40:44.810
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING?

40:44.843 --> 40:46.478
AT LEAST
25 YEARS IN JAIL.

40:46.512 --> 40:47.979
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.248
ESPECIALLY HIM.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.917
(Eric)
I'M THE ONE

40:51.950 --> 40:53.519
YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER.

40:53.552 --> 40:55.554
HEY, YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA GET OVER ME.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.489
(Eric)
HEY! YOU HEAR ME?

40:57.523 --> 40:59.858
I'M THE BEST
THAT YOU EVER HAD!

40:59.891 --> 41:01.893
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET ME!

41:01.927 --> 41:04.129
YOU'LL NEVER FORGET ME,
DO YOU HEAR ME?

41:04.162 --> 41:06.164
YOU WILL NEVER FORGET ME!
