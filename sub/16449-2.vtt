WEBVTT

00:02.128 --> 00:04.713
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.

00:05.006 --> 00:05.880
Cool!

00:06.215 --> 00:08.633
Eleanor, you are my soulmate.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.552
There's been a big mistake...

00:11.554 --> 00:13.471
I'm not supposed to be here.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.472
Wait, what?

00:14.765 --> 00:16.891
These people might be "good"

00:16.976 --> 00:19.144
but are they really
that much better than me?

00:22.440 --> 00:25.275
Eleanor,
this is all happening because of you!

00:25.443 --> 00:28.194
Give me a chance.
Let me earn my place here.

00:28.279 --> 00:30.155
Let me be your ethical guinea pig.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.407
My soul is in your hands, soulmate.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.245
I, uh... I don't know what to do here.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.581
This is a mess - morally speaking.

00:39.707 --> 00:43.793
This is a putrid,
disgusting bowl of ethical soup.

00:43.878 --> 00:46.337
Okay, well, how about we just chill

00:46.797 --> 00:50.091
and go to the town meeting
and talk it out after.

00:50.426 --> 00:51.426
Wha-
- Great! Hey

00:51.469 --> 00:53.470
how do I make
that helper woman show up?

00:54.221 --> 00:56.097
Hello... front desk lady...

00:56.515 --> 00:59.017
magical slave robot?
- Excuse me, Janet?

00:59.060 --> 01:00.685
Hi, there.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.605
Still not used to it.
Um, Janet, I need...

01:04.482 --> 01:07.942
quick question - can anyone
access our search history

01:07.985 --> 01:10.695
or is this an incognito browsing situation

01:10.738 --> 01:12.906
like when you're stalking
a hot mailman from your work computer?

01:12.948 --> 01:14.908
It is one hundred percent confidential.

01:14.950 --> 01:18.036
No one can access what you ask me,
including Michael.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.663
Now, what kind of pornography
would you like to see?

01:20.706 --> 01:22.082
No, no, no, no, not porn...

01:22.124 --> 01:25.960
I, um, I need clothes - like yours
and Chidi's with the stripes.

01:26.337 --> 01:27.378
There you go.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.467
Everybody,
everybody, gather round, please.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.510
Thank you. Thank you.

01:33.803 --> 01:36.971
Obviously, there's something
very wrong with this neighbourhood.

01:37.348 --> 01:41.810
We don't know what it is,
how long it will last, or what caused it.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.228
What do we know, Janet?

01:43.395 --> 01:45.855
We know where it happened - here.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.107
Yes, thank you, Janet.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.525
The chaos happened here.

01:48.984 --> 01:51.402
See, that's the trouble
with these perfect systems -

01:51.445 --> 01:53.071
one little flaw can lead to...

01:54.323 --> 01:57.367
well, it can lead to Gary over there.

01:58.494 --> 01:59.494
Hey, Gary.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.787
Hang in there, buddy.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.498
My armpits are leaking.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.416
What is that called again?
- Sweat.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.752
Right, right, still not used to being
in a human body.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.170
And what do you do with sweat?

02:09.213 --> 02:10.296
Do... do you lick it away?
Is that right?

02:10.840 --> 02:13.591
Nope, you dab it with a cloth.
- Oh, right.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.052
And then you lick the cloth?

02:16.595 --> 02:17.512
That seems weirder.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.266
Michael, look.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.309
Okay, that's a good sign.

02:23.352 --> 02:25.603
It... it... it could mean
that this is almost over.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.689
Oh, such relief.

02:28.023 --> 02:31.317
That was my first time as a fashion "don't"
and I did not care for it.

02:39.201 --> 02:42.203
Okay, things are settling down outside

02:42.246 --> 02:47.000
I think it's time to make me good, partner.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.168
How do we do it?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.962
Is there a pill I can take
or something I could vape?

02:51.589 --> 02:52.964
Where did you get a chalkboard?

02:53.007 --> 02:56.259
It's The Good Place, you can get
anything you want at any time.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.677
And you chose a chalkboard?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.387
What are you reading?

03:00.055 --> 03:02.599
<i>The Metaphysics of Morals</i>
by Immanuel Kant.

03:02.641 --> 03:05.018
It's a treatise
on the aesthetic preconditions

03:05.060 --> 03:06.603
of the mind's receptivity to duty.

03:08.022 --> 03:09.314
It's a book on how to act good.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.816
Oh, great!
So you've decided to help me?

03:11.859 --> 03:14.694
I don't know.
There's a thousand questions.

03:14.778 --> 03:17.322
Is there a moral imperative to help you?

03:17.781 --> 03:20.241
Do I have a greater obligation
to my community?

03:20.284 --> 03:23.203
Are you taking someone else's spot -
someone who deserves to be here?

03:23.245 --> 03:24.412
Ooh! On that question

03:24.747 --> 03:28.041
I honestly think
I was just put here by mistake

03:28.083 --> 03:30.585
because Michael called me
Eleanor Shellstrop

03:30.628 --> 03:32.253
so he knows I'm me -

03:32.296 --> 03:36.424
he... he's just wrong
about my overall quality level.

03:36.759 --> 03:40.220
Please help me, man.
I swear I am worth it.

03:40.679 --> 03:43.056
Tell me one fact
that you know about me.

03:43.766 --> 03:46.559
We spent the whole day together.
You must remember something.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.062
What country am I from?

03:49.188 --> 03:51.898
Is it racist if I say, "Africa?"

03:52.316 --> 03:55.693
Yes, and Africa is not a country.
I am from Senegal.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.780
Do I have any siblings?
Where did I go to college?

03:58.822 --> 04:01.449
Trick question - you didn't.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.577
I was literally a college professor.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.330
Do you not remember
one single thing about me?

04:07.373 --> 04:09.666
Dude, things have been nuts around here.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.417
I bet you don't know anything about me!

04:11.460 --> 04:13.920
You were born in Phoenix.
You went to school in Tempe.

04:13.963 --> 04:14.837
You're an only child.

04:14.880 --> 04:17.632
Your favourite show is something called,
<i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta.</i>

04:17.675 --> 04:22.178
And your favourite book is
Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.

04:23.347 --> 04:24.597
How did you know all that?

04:24.640 --> 04:28.810
Because you are constantly
talking about yourself.

04:28.852 --> 04:32.063
You are the most self-obsessed person
I have ever met.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.857
You should see
Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.567
See, this is my fear about you, Eleanor -

04:36.610 --> 04:39.988
you are too selfish to ever be a good person.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.991
Well, I think you're wrong.
- What country am I from again?

04:43.033 --> 04:46.160
"Sen... sodyne"

04:46.495 --> 04:47.829
That is a brand of toothpaste.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.331
Look, the only thing
that you are concerned with

04:50.582 --> 04:51.958
is your own happiness.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.335
That's your problem.

04:58.757 --> 05:03.052
Okay, names in the hat -
time to pick a designated driver.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.679
And the loser is...

05:06.223 --> 05:07.098
Betsy.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.850
Wait, you never get picked

05:08.892 --> 05:10.768
and you're always the one
who draws the name.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.186
Let me see that.
- There's no need.

05:12.438 --> 05:15.481
Everyone here believes in my integrity,
one hundred percent. Right, guys?

05:16.442 --> 05:17.525
Give it to me.

05:18.777 --> 05:19.736
For the record

05:20.904 --> 05:23.781
I did that out of principle
because it absolutely had your name on it.

05:24.158 --> 05:27.493
If I check the other ones I can figure it out
by process of elimination.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.875
Again, out of principle

05:33.917 --> 05:35.543
better watch over you, Betsy.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.503
This is what integrity looks like.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.508
All right, everyone, let's get started.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.260
Things have settled down.

05:44.303 --> 05:45.386
Whoo!

05:45.763 --> 05:47.263
So, hopefully, we're off and running.

05:47.598 --> 05:50.391
Welcome to orientation, day two.

05:50.476 --> 05:52.602
Now, today we're going to start
with something

05:52.644 --> 05:54.854
that everyone has always wanted to do...

05:54.897 --> 05:56.647
...flying.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.903
Now that you're dead,
let's live a little, right?

06:02.071 --> 06:06.199
Uh, sorry... uh, Michael, if I might -

06:06.241 --> 06:09.494
I was just thinking... earlier today
in all of the chaos

06:10.037 --> 06:12.413
large swaths of this neighbourhood
were destroyed.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.540
We thought perhaps
some of us could... uh...

06:14.583 --> 06:16.542
volunteer to help clean up
the debris, you know

06:16.585 --> 06:19.670
it's quite a fun way to band together
as a community.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.755
Isn't that right, Jianyu?

06:22.091 --> 06:24.217
Oh, uh, yes, sorry,
for those of you don't know -

06:24.259 --> 06:26.386
my soulmate Jianyu here
is a Buddhist monk.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.097
He took a vow of silence
that he's still observing -

06:29.556 --> 06:31.432
even here, in The Good Place.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.684
It's truly inspiring.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.562
Well, Tahani,
it's not really your job to clean up

06:36.605 --> 06:39.565
but I suppose there's no harm
if you really want to.

06:39.775 --> 06:40.983
Oh, well, "Hurrah!"

06:41.360 --> 06:43.319
We need about, uh, twelve volunteers.

06:44.113 --> 06:45.988
Oh!
- I can't believe all these people

06:46.073 --> 06:48.950
are passing on flying
to pick up garbage all day.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.202
Have fun, nerds.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.414
I'll be soaring through the air
like a forking bird.

06:55.124 --> 06:58.334
Eleanor and I would love to help.
- Oh, "Hurrah, hurrah!". Yay!

06:58.669 --> 07:00.711
Dude?
- You want to prove you're not selfish?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.130
Here's the perfect test -

07:02.172 --> 07:05.049
there's something fun that you want to do
and then there's something less fun

07:05.092 --> 07:06.801
that people are doing
for the common good.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.010
Which do you choose?

07:10.180 --> 07:11.055
Have fun.

07:12.683 --> 07:13.558
Whoo!

07:17.396 --> 07:19.480
Yay! Yeah! All right!

07:19.857 --> 07:21.732
Wee!

07:21.775 --> 07:26.654
Hey, up there - having fun
or does it maybe suck, probably?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.364
Well, I wouldn't call it fun...

07:28.407 --> 07:32.743
I'd say it's like it's like fifty million
simultaneous orgasms, but better.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.745
How's volunteer garbage pickup?

07:35.080 --> 07:38.875
About the same.
- Great. Wee!

07:42.129 --> 07:44.755
You know, this really reminds me
of my time in Vietnam

07:44.965 --> 07:47.967
picking up mortar shells
with my Godmother, Diana.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.052
Doesn't really matter
what she's a princess of.

07:50.095 --> 07:50.970
It's not really important.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.889
Tahani, how goes the cleaning?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.682
Oh, swimmingly, Michael.

07:54.725 --> 07:59.145
And I have to say, this neighbourhood
that you built is truly a masterpiece

07:59.188 --> 08:00.688
the likes of which I've never seen

08:00.731 --> 08:03.191
and I've been to Johnny Depp's
private bird sanctuary.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.026
Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.

08:05.068 --> 08:08.279
But it's also dead wrong.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.740
This neighbourhood is a disaster.

08:11.408 --> 08:14.994
See, I must have made a mistake somewhere
and it led to all this chaos

08:15.037 --> 08:17.663
and now I'm just... I'm just terrified
that it's going to happen again.

08:17.915 --> 08:19.790
I'm trying to put a good face on...

08:20.417 --> 08:23.336
well, this face
that I've constructed for myself

08:23.378 --> 08:27.089
but the truth is, I'm just miserable.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.217
I have to go.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.219
Thank you so much for your service.

08:32.012 --> 08:35.306
Oh, no... powerful people
do not handle failure well.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.600
Michael could be heading
for a total meltdown.

08:39.478 --> 08:42.355
Soulmate, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:42.564 --> 08:43.856
Should we say it at the same time?

08:43.899 --> 08:47.944
All right, one, two, three -
we must help Michael.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.613
Oh, you sly devil

08:50.864 --> 08:52.615
you're going
to keep me on my toes, aren't you?

08:52.866 --> 08:54.575
All right, come on, let's go.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.372
Oh, boy!
- Hey, Gunnar. Hey, Antonio.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.040
Hey, Eleanor, isn't this great?

09:01.083 --> 09:03.751
Uh, yeah - when I thought of the afterlife

09:03.794 --> 09:08.089
I totally pictured being an unpaid,
nonflying janitor.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.632
Us, too.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.926
You guys are so fun -

09:12.261 --> 09:14.345
just relentlessly fun.
I keep thinking -

09:14.388 --> 09:16.138
when are they going to stop being fun?

09:16.348 --> 09:17.723
And the answer is, never.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.518
You're never going to stop.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.898
Well, I have had a pretty full day
of being unselfish.

09:25.941 --> 09:29.443
I've made some new friends,
my area is almost garbage free

09:29.736 --> 09:32.613
so you're going to help me
figure out how to stay, right?

09:32.781 --> 09:34.448
Oh, that is a really tough question.

09:34.658 --> 09:38.160
Most great philosophers would say
helping you is pointless -

09:38.203 --> 09:39.579
that you can't try to be good

09:39.621 --> 09:42.123
especially when your motivations
are so obviously corrupt.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.126
Yeah, but what do
most great philosophers know?

09:45.168 --> 09:47.253
On the other hand,
Aristotle thought that moral virtue

09:47.296 --> 09:48.963
is something
that you could get better at.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.132
He... he compared it
to playing the flute -

09:51.174 --> 09:52.883
the more you practice,
the more you improve.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.052
Aristotle
- that's my boy right there!

09:55.387 --> 09:58.472
He was the best. I mean,
most people agree he was the best one.

09:58.932 --> 10:03.436
So it sounds to me like you are
on board the "help Eleanor train."

10:03.645 --> 10:06.439
Well, I've narrowed it down
to two possibilities - yes and no.

10:07.316 --> 10:10.610
Well, no worries - just hit me up

10:10.652 --> 10:13.154
when you're done
weighing my life in your hands.

10:13.196 --> 10:17.241
I'll just keep doing what I do best -
being super-considerate and selfless.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.163
Hey, guys.
- Okay, Eleanor, reminder -

10:22.205 --> 10:24.165
we switched to a rotating system

10:24.207 --> 10:27.251
for choosing a designated driver
and it's your turn.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.294
Got it.

10:28.754 --> 10:31.672
Full disclosure - I forgot
we were doing this new system.

10:31.715 --> 10:32.965
I got off work early.

10:33.008 --> 10:36.385
I've been here for about an hour
and I'm already pretty drunk.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.388
Someone else will do it.
- Good call.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.558
I guess the only place I'll be driving
is through the giant loophole

10:42.601 --> 10:45.394
in the system I accidentally discovered.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.730
Beep, beep!

10:49.733 --> 10:50.608
Whoo!

10:51.234 --> 10:54.362
Whoo!

10:54.446 --> 10:57.323
I can't believe they managed
to mix one million flavours together

10:57.366 --> 11:00.117
and yet, somehow I can taste
each individual one.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.285
It's remarkable.

11:01.703 --> 11:02.953
I got no flavour.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.873
It's all I deserve really.
- No.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.209
Look, I... I appreciate
you trying to cheer me up

11:08.251 --> 11:10.252
I really do,
but you don't understand -

11:10.295 --> 11:13.798
this was the very first neighbourhood
that I got to design.

11:14.007 --> 11:17.134
It was my chance to prove myself
and now I've blown it.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.346
You know, sometimes a flaw
can make something even more beautiful -

11:20.514 --> 11:22.390
like with Cindy Crawford
and how short she is.

11:22.432 --> 11:26.143
Oh, Tahani, if I made
one tiny mistake in my design

11:26.186 --> 11:28.354
if there's a single glitch
in the system

11:28.730 --> 11:32.858
if even one blade of grass
is angled a fraction of a degree off...

11:35.987 --> 11:39.365
the whole neighbourhood is...
compromised.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.661
Whose dog is that?
Guys, whose dog is that?

11:44.913 --> 11:45.996
Whose dog is that!

11:46.581 --> 11:50.042
See, this is one of those glitches
I was talking about.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.044
Nice try, puppy.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.847
Whoo!

12:02.889 --> 12:03.973
That was a close one.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.349
Teacup?

12:06.560 --> 12:09.186
Hey, have you seen my dog?

12:16.319 --> 12:19.155
Shouldn't these be magical trash bags?

12:19.740 --> 12:22.241
Five more minutes,
flyers, five more minutes.

12:22.701 --> 12:23.701
Oh, man, really?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.713
Janet, I'm finished with clean up
and I'm ready to fly.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.506
How do I start?
- Hop on the launch pad

12:37.549 --> 12:40.217
and conjure
an image that brings you pure joy.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.429
Some people think of their wedding
day or favourite vacation spot.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.182
People puking on rollercoasters.

12:46.892 --> 12:49.226
People puking on rollercoasters.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.604
It's working!

12:52.105 --> 12:54.023
Ow! What the fork?

12:57.527 --> 13:01.489
Janet, any chance this is
a scheduled trash storm?

13:03.325 --> 13:05.117
So, here's the situation, Pevita -

13:05.952 --> 13:08.370
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.

13:08.872 --> 13:10.581
But, I got her back.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.292
Everything... everything seems fine.

13:13.335 --> 13:16.086
Teacup, thank goodness you're okay.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.423
Everyone, it is merely
a construct of a dog.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.426
It feels no pain or joy or love.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.261
Teacup doesn't love me?

13:25.639 --> 13:29.141
Oh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
it definitely feels love.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.852
Do you actually want a dog
that loves you a little bit more?

13:31.895 --> 13:33.562
Because I can kick her
right back into the sun

13:33.605 --> 13:34.814
and get you another one, just like that.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.525
No!
- Oh, boy, I'm making things worse.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.277
Okay. All right... that's all right,
breathe, breathe... you breathe?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.112
Mm-hmm.
- If you do, then just breathe

13:42.155 --> 13:44.532
because everything is fine,
Michael, it's fine.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.449
Whoo!

13:46.868 --> 13:48.577
It's raining garbage.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.495
Run!

13:50.705 --> 13:52.498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I'll run this way.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.673
Chidi, hey

14:00.715 --> 14:01.841
before you say anything...

14:04.010 --> 14:05.636
that's it.
I just don't want you to say anything.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.471
What did you do?
- Nothing.

14:07.514 --> 14:11.892
It just started raining trash
out of nowhere for no reason at all.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.018
Ah!

14:13.478 --> 14:17.523
Okay, fine, fine - my bag broke
and I ditched the trash

14:17.566 --> 14:19.149
instead of taking it all the way
to the dumpster.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.653
But, in my defence
there were only five minutes left

14:22.696 --> 14:24.530
in flying and I wanted to go flying.

14:24.573 --> 14:27.199
How is that a defence?
You made a bad choice.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.409
I made a bad choice?

14:28.451 --> 14:30.786
We could have literally been flying

14:30.829 --> 14:33.038
and all you wanted to do
was talk about morals.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.624
I mean, you're like
the worst part of Superman.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.419
This is a relief.
I can stop my deliberations.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.463
You are a selfish person
and it is pointless to help you.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.424
- You are on your own.
- Oh, man.

14:45.302 --> 14:48.262
How about this trash storm, Gunnar?
- More cleaning up to do.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.972
It's a... it's a dream come true.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.604
Whew.
- We're okay.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.397
You can't die here.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.942
Come on, I mean even you have
to admit - those guys are psycho.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.989
I don't know
what's happening to me.

15:07.032 --> 15:11.911
I mean, it's my duty to be calm
and in control and I'm falling apart.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.205
No, Michael,
you are a paragon of fortitude.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.957
You're a mountain of strength.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.752
I'm not a mountain of strength.

15:20.503 --> 15:21.670
I'm a canyon

15:22.881 --> 15:25.090
full of poo-poo.

15:25.634 --> 15:28.969
Jianyu, the architect of this neighbourhood
has just referred to himself

15:29.012 --> 15:31.347
as a canyon full of poo-poo.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.682
Surely now
you will say something.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.184
Grace us
with your vocalised wisdom.

15:35.226 --> 15:36.769
Please, I'm begging you.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.075
Oh...

15:54.496 --> 15:56.580
Yes, yes I understand.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.749
The strength is inside me.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.709
It's been there all along.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.879
No, of course.
I can overcome any obstacle.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.632
Oh, thank you, Jianyu,
thank you.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.762
I'm back.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.350
You did it!

16:16.810 --> 16:19.186
Oh, you have so much to teach me.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.313
Maybe I should try
to be silent, too.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.774
No really... look, here I go.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.445
Oh! That was wonderful.

16:28.488 --> 16:29.613
So cleansing.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.374
Just water tonight, huh?

16:41.126 --> 16:43.669
Designated driver?
- Yeah, it sucks.

16:43.712 --> 16:46.130
I think it's awesome.
I mean, someone's got to do it, right?

16:46.756 --> 16:48.215
I think it's a cool thing
to do for people.

16:49.300 --> 16:50.801
Yeah, no, no, I meant...

16:50.844 --> 16:54.847
I meant I... it sucks that I can't
do it more often.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.057
You know,
I actually prefer it to drinking...

16:57.183 --> 17:00.686
staying sober, knowing my friends
will get home safe -

17:01.604 --> 17:02.855
that's my buzz.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.610
Hey guys, good news and bad news -

17:08.945 --> 17:10.821
see that hot bartender over there?

17:10.864 --> 17:13.073
He's into me
and we're gonna bang it out.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.617
The bad news is it means
I can't drive you guys home.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.662
But, I did call a cab for you guys

17:18.705 --> 17:21.415
but they recognised my number
and they didn't want to come.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.375
I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.419
So, are we good here?

17:26.546 --> 17:28.964
Eleanor, you have
a very important choice to make -

17:29.215 --> 17:34.011
if you blow us off, you are banned
from Thursday night drinks forever.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.433
Yeah, I'm good with that.
I'll see you guys at work.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.434
Peace!

17:40.769 --> 17:41.810
You - let's go.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.618
Hey, how did you know
I was here?

17:57.869 --> 17:59.244
I saw you from my window.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.165
That's where I live, by the way...
not that you ever asked.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.501
What are you doing?

18:06.127 --> 18:10.839
I went to all the places
where I dumped trash earlier

18:10.882 --> 18:13.383
and cleaned it up
so it couldn't be traced back to me.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.720
Well, it looks like
you cleaned up everything.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.765
You're doing this
because you feel bad

18:20.725 --> 18:22.518
and you're not even doing it
to get me to help you anymore

18:22.560 --> 18:24.520
because I told you,
that's not gonna happen.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.315
Okay, yeah, fine,
I felt bad for stupid Gunnar

18:28.358 --> 18:31.151
and stupider Antonio
and the whole neighbourhood.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.736
I felt bad about what I did.

18:32.821 --> 18:36.156
It was a weird feeling...
not used to it... didn't love it.

18:36.366 --> 18:39.910
Well, feeling remorse
about being wrong isn't as good

18:39.953 --> 18:42.454
as just doing something right,
but it's a start.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.499
Look, I think you're capable of change

18:45.959 --> 18:48.919
and I will help you try.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.339
Oh, wow, man -
I swear I won't let you down.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.425
Hi, there. I've collected
the worst smelling garbage that I could find.

18:55.844 --> 18:58.262
Do you still want me
to dump it inside of Antonio's house?

18:59.055 --> 19:00.764
What?

19:00.807 --> 19:03.433
No, I did not tell you to do that.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.185
You are loco girlfriend.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.354
Okay, I won't let you down
starting now.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.446
Ah, Eleanor, good morning.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.074
Michael, do you know
what the best part about this place is -

19:19.117 --> 19:21.034
you figured out
how to make a to-go cup

19:21.077 --> 19:23.787
that doesn't leak
right where the seam meets the lid.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.622
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.790
I was very proud of that.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.667
One of the hardest problems
I had to solve.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.337
Eleanor, I know what you did...

19:34.174 --> 19:36.300
cleaning up the entire neighbourhood
by yourself.

19:37.802 --> 19:40.345
I knew you were special
but this is proof.

19:40.513 --> 19:43.015
Well, I was just doing my part,
you know.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.310
And... since I'm special -
your words -

19:46.519 --> 19:48.270
I didn't get to fly...

19:48.313 --> 19:51.607
I'm sorry. Now I had to ban flying
for a thousand years

19:51.649 --> 19:52.733
too many injuries.

19:52.859 --> 19:57.779
One resident hit a rotting turkey carcass
at a thousand miles an hour.

19:57.864 --> 20:03.827
It just exploded into this fireball
of turkey flesh and bones and sinew.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.833
Anyway, enjoy your coffee...
and the cup.

20:12.837 --> 20:17.382
So, I have moved out of my apartment
officially and into your guestroom

20:17.425 --> 20:20.219
figured it'd cause less suspicion
and make things easier

20:20.261 --> 20:21.428
for our "Good Person Lessons."

20:21.471 --> 20:24.556
Cool. Uh, just FYI, I'm a very loud snorer

20:24.599 --> 20:28.268
and I like to drip-dry in the nude,
so eyes to yourself, perv.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.394
Okay. Fine.

20:29.437 --> 20:32.564
Now, you got a long way to go
to pull this off.

20:32.607 --> 20:36.026
It will take hours and hours
of studying ethics

20:36.069 --> 20:37.194
and moral philosophy.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.823
We're going to have assignments
and quizzes and papers.

20:41.866 --> 20:43.867
It's going to be so much fun.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.911
Remind me
what I'm getting out of this again?

20:46.287 --> 20:48.038
You get to avoid eternal damnation.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.539
Oh, yeah, right.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.000
Hey, I got you a present.

20:52.043 --> 20:54.336
What?
- Senegal.

20:55.088 --> 20:57.256
That's not a present.
That's just common decency.

20:57.298 --> 20:59.132
Yeah, but I forking nailed it.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.301
Good talk.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.239
Aw, shirt!
