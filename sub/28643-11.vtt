24:18.146 --> 24:20.148

moment with me,

24:20.182 --> 24:23.323

the one from the beginning.

24:23.358 --> 24:25.256

she had shared with me.

24:25.291 --> 24:28.846

the fact that she had sex

I believe that she does.

25:00.568 --> 25:01.948

I will corroborate the fact

25:01.983 --> 25:03.536
that you were a frontrunner,

25:03.571 --> 25:05.780
and she did say that
about love at first sight,

25:05.814 --> 25:07.644
and you guys definitely had
a special relationship,

25:07.678 --> 25:11.302

as long as it did, um...

25:11.337 --> 25:12.441

25:12.476 --> 25:15.514
- But it was also
extremely contentious,

25:15.548 --> 25:18.689
and it really was--it all kind
of came back to the faith,

25:18.724 --> 25:23.073
which is a debate
that we really have not had

25:23.107 --> 25:25.178

25:25.213 --> 25:26.628

25:26.663 --> 25:28.596
and how you guys apply that
to your lives...

25:28.630 --> 25:30.529
- Right.
- Is very different.

25:30.563 --> 25:31.806

in your relationship.

right now?

Love is a commitment.

26:37.975 --> 26:39.667
I was ready to fight
through anything with her.

26:39.701 --> 26:41.392

It was frustrating,
you know, being misunderstood.

26:53.681 --> 26:56.615

I was judging her,

26:56.649 --> 26:58.375

27:00.480 --> 27:03.242
Yeah, I was--I was shocked.

27:03.276 --> 27:07.626

the first emotion,

27:07.660 --> 27:09.489
and...

27:10.939 --> 27:12.596
Yeah, I was very confused.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.081
You know,
Hannah brought up me with pride,

27:15.116 --> 27:17.325

I did have a lot of pride,

27:17.359 --> 27:18.844

she was right in that respect?

because...

27:51.359 --> 27:54.189

is pushing it a little far

a two-way street.

I still love her.

28:17.592 --> 28:20.250
I still want
what's best for her.

28:20.284 --> 28:22.562
And I boldly say that.

28:22.597 --> 28:25.704
But I also boldly say that
I know that she's not my person.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.465
- Looking back...

28:30.743 --> 28:33.539
Do you feel like
you made any mistakes?

28:49.037 --> 28:51.488
- If I could go back,
I wouldn't change a thing.

28:51.522 --> 28:53.628
[audience murmurs]

28:53.662 --> 28:55.216
- Nothing?

28:55.250 --> 28:57.805
[light laughter]

28:57.839 --> 28:59.151
- [mouthing]

29:00.359 --> 29:01.774
- All right,
wanna stop right there.

29:01.809 --> 29:03.500
Luke, sit tight.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.467
More with Luke P.
when we come back.

29:14.545 --> 29:17.169
[cheers and applause]

29:17.203 --> 29:18.584
- Welcome back
to "The Bachelorette:

29:18.618 --> 29:20.206
The Men Tell All,"

29:20.241 --> 29:23.278
an intense, emotional night
sitting here with Luke P.

29:23.313 --> 29:25.591
All the guys are here.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.558
Let me ask this again.
- Let me--let me just say this.

29:27.593 --> 29:29.629
[laughter]
Where I'm coming from...

29:29.664 --> 29:32.701
[indistinct shouting
and clapping]

29:34.255 --> 29:35.981
[laughter, mocking]

29:36.015 --> 29:37.741
You done over there?
All right.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.088
Obviously, if I could go back,
I would change a whole lot,

29:40.123 --> 29:43.126
but I'm just thankful that it--
it played out the way it did,

29:43.160 --> 29:44.644
and I'm thankful
for the opportunity

29:44.679 --> 29:46.474
to learn and grow as a man
from it all.

29:46.508 --> 29:47.647
That's what I mean.

29:47.682 --> 29:49.788
Now, you're talking about...

29:49.822 --> 29:51.824
me and the guys
or just me and Hannah?

29:51.859 --> 29:52.998
- You know what?
It could start with the guys.

29:53.032 --> 29:54.378
'Cause maybe
that was part of it.

29:54.413 --> 29:56.967
So just where you think
things went wrong for you,

29:57.002 --> 29:58.520
and where you made mistakes.

29:58.555 --> 30:01.834
- I think the turning point
with the guys really was...

30:02.697 --> 30:04.492
was Rhode Island.

30:04.526 --> 30:08.220
Being there...
in a situation where...

30:09.359 --> 30:11.602
You know, I straight up...

30:11.637 --> 30:13.259
bold-face lie to Luke S.,

30:13.294 --> 30:17.229
and I did have the whole
sideline conflict with Luke S.

30:17.263 --> 30:19.403
We'll leave it at that
and not get into details.

30:19.438 --> 30:21.543
But...

30:21.578 --> 30:24.098
you know,
it's tough when the house...

30:24.132 --> 30:27.342
is in a position
where they think you're crazy,

30:27.377 --> 30:30.035
you're a psychopath,
and you're a liar.

30:30.069 --> 30:31.968
I watched the season.

30:32.002 --> 30:34.142
I didn't like that Luke P. guy,

30:34.177 --> 30:36.455
and I don't blame 'em for that,

30:36.489 --> 30:37.870
but one of the hardest things

30:37.905 --> 30:40.252
in this whole process
for me was,

30:40.286 --> 30:42.047
you know,
on-camera/off-camera,

30:42.081 --> 30:44.877
being neglected,
being disrespected,

30:44.912 --> 30:46.568
having...

30:46.603 --> 30:49.157
you know, been jabbed,
so to speak,

30:49.192 --> 30:52.471
and come at by all the guys
constantly.

30:52.505 --> 30:55.370
And then talk about
what was really hard--

30:55.405 --> 30:58.132
is harder than that was...

30:58.166 --> 31:01.618
the woman that I really thought
was the woman of my dreams

31:01.652 --> 31:04.414
was struggling
of confiding in me,

31:04.448 --> 31:06.347
and she was really questioning
my integrity

31:06.381 --> 31:08.142
and my character
the whole process.

31:08.176 --> 31:09.833
That was the hardest thing.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.317
You know,
the guys was one thing,

31:11.352 --> 31:13.112
but it was like
a two-headed dragon...

31:13.147 --> 31:14.665
- Right.
- And it was--it was not easy.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.392
You know,
from day one coming here,

31:17.427 --> 31:20.740
you know, I felt like I was on
a-a rescue mission for Hannah.

31:20.775 --> 31:22.604
That's how I--that's
how I like to look at it.

31:22.639 --> 31:24.365
I really felt I was something

31:24.399 --> 31:26.505
that was gonna be good for her
in a future husband.

31:26.539 --> 31:29.611
- So when you say...

31:29.646 --> 31:31.890
"rescue her"...

31:31.924 --> 31:35.755
to me that means in your mind
she needed to be saved.

31:36.964 --> 31:38.724
- Okay, let me--let me--
let me back up.

31:38.758 --> 31:41.900
[laughter, dispersed booing]

31:41.934 --> 31:43.936
I don't--I don't wanna be
misconstrued here, sorry.

31:43.971 --> 31:45.455
When I say "rescue mission,"

31:45.489 --> 31:47.836
um, I just meant from--
from them.

31:47.871 --> 31:50.909
You know, I'm talking about,
uh, me thinking that,

31:50.943 --> 31:52.117
you know, these guys,

31:52.151 --> 31:53.221
regardless
if we're talking about

31:53.256 --> 31:54.740
being there
for the right reasons

31:54.774 --> 31:57.156
or if they're something that's
good for her in the future,

31:57.191 --> 31:59.779
that's what I'm talking about
when I say "rescue mission."

31:59.814 --> 32:02.541
- Um, the--the--

32:02.575 --> 32:03.645
- I gotta go.

32:05.406 --> 32:06.890
- Who is that?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.203
- Man, I just gotta
call out [bleep] when I see it,

32:09.237 --> 32:12.206
and I think that, ultimately...
- Devin.

32:12.240 --> 32:13.310
- I'm gonna sit down
right here

32:13.345 --> 32:14.933
'cause I just have
to say my piece.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.417
- This is Devin, everybody.

32:16.451 --> 32:18.522
[cheers and applause]
- Um...

32:18.557 --> 32:19.627
[chuckles]

32:19.661 --> 32:21.732
We've been backstage
watching this,

32:21.767 --> 32:23.182
and, honestly, man, I've just--

32:23.217 --> 32:25.391
my blood has been boiling.

32:25.426 --> 32:27.359
Luke,
there are two type of men.

32:27.393 --> 32:30.569
There's a--there are men
that want an independent,

32:30.603 --> 32:32.053
strong woman,

32:32.088 --> 32:34.642
and there are men that want
a woman that they can control.

32:35.505 --> 32:38.611
I feel right now
that you are the man

32:38.646 --> 32:40.372
that wants to control a woman

32:40.406 --> 32:42.546
so that you can feel better
about yourself.

32:42.581 --> 32:44.479
[cheers and applause]

32:44.514 --> 32:46.723
And that--and I'm sorry--

32:46.757 --> 32:49.415
I'm sorry, but that's not--
that's not a man.

32:49.450 --> 32:51.452
That's not a man,
and what blows my mind

32:51.486 --> 32:52.694
is you're saying that you--
you're--

32:52.729 --> 32:54.179
you know,
you were on a "rescue mission,"

32:54.213 --> 32:58.010
but it seems that the only
person that needed rescuing

32:58.045 --> 33:00.668
was Hannah from you,
ultimately.

33:00.702 --> 33:02.981
[cheers and applause]
I mean--

33:03.015 --> 33:06.812
And I--and I understand
being young,

33:06.846 --> 33:10.022
and it takes time to become,
like, a man and make mistakes,

33:10.057 --> 33:13.750
but, dude, you had
a very long time of mistakes...

33:13.784 --> 33:15.959
[applause]
So I can't--I'm sorry, Chris.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.892
- No, no.
I'm gonna put a pin in this.

33:17.926 --> 33:19.376
I appreciate you coming out.
- Yeah.

33:19.411 --> 33:20.929
- Appreciate you coming out.
- I don't even get to share--

33:20.964 --> 33:22.448
- No, no, well, you--
I'm gonna send him off.

33:22.483 --> 33:23.829
I-I wanna finish up with you
and then--

33:23.863 --> 33:25.244
'cause we are gonna
bring all the guys out.

33:25.279 --> 33:26.694
Just--thanks, Devin.
I appreciate it.

33:26.728 --> 33:28.592
[cheers and applause]
Um...

33:28.627 --> 33:30.732
I just wanna finish up.

33:30.767 --> 33:34.046
[applause]

33:34.081 --> 33:37.118
But first I'll let you rebut
to what he was saying.

33:37.153 --> 33:38.430
You know, was that--

33:38.464 --> 33:40.535
is--is that something
you've thought about of

33:40.570 --> 33:42.020
is that the type
of woman you want?

33:42.054 --> 33:44.056
Someone you can kind of put
on the shelf in a glass case

33:44.091 --> 33:46.300
and...pull down when you need?

33:57.138 --> 33:59.244
- Just give a second, Chris.
- Mm-kay.

34:23.095 --> 34:25.270
- The last thing that I want...

34:27.203 --> 34:29.688
And the last thing
I'll ever do...

34:29.722 --> 34:31.345
is control a woman.

34:32.691 --> 34:34.624
And...

34:34.658 --> 34:38.628
I do want an independent woman
in my life for my future wife.

34:38.662 --> 34:41.217
I want a woman...

34:41.251 --> 34:43.909
that will make decisions
for herself...

34:43.943 --> 34:45.876
and that won't need me
when I'm there.

34:45.911 --> 34:48.879
Although a man is supposed
to lead and guide a woman

34:48.914 --> 34:50.847
in the relationship.

34:50.881 --> 34:52.849
Now...

34:52.883 --> 34:54.575
for you guys
watching me backstage,

34:54.609 --> 34:56.094
you contestants,

34:56.128 --> 34:59.131
I'm not here to argue.
[laughter]

35:00.477 --> 35:03.446
I'm not here to argue
and defend myself,

35:03.480 --> 35:05.862
so whoever's next to come out,
lay it on me.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.864

are about to come out.

good to see you all again.

36:53.452 --> 36:55.903
Thanks for being here,
got a lot to unpack

36:55.937 --> 36:57.387
and get to tonight.

36:57.422 --> 37:01.080
Obviously, we're gonna start
with the elephant in the room,

37:01.115 --> 37:03.600
the man sitting next to me,
Luke.

37:03.635 --> 37:04.877
Luke and I have been
out here talking.

37:04.912 --> 37:06.224
I think you guys heard
a lot of it.

37:06.258 --> 37:09.399
Luke, before I go up
to the guys,

37:09.434 --> 37:12.091
people watching
and even myself,

37:12.126 --> 37:14.335
sometimes I was like,
"Just--"

37:14.370 --> 37:15.750
Like, "just fall on the sword.

37:15.785 --> 37:17.062
Just fix it with the guys."

37:17.096 --> 37:18.926
Like, "Just start fresh,
let's make it better."

37:18.960 --> 37:20.410
You guys couldn't do that.

37:20.445 --> 37:21.860
Like, you could never
get past that.

37:21.894 --> 37:23.482
It just got worse and worse.

37:23.517 --> 37:24.552
Why?

37:24.587 --> 37:26.899
- You know,
the first few weeks

37:26.934 --> 37:30.696
you could tell with my actions
that I had it in the bag.

37:30.731 --> 37:33.251
You know, I really thought
that at some point

37:33.285 --> 37:36.392
Hannah was gonna be like,
"All right, send the guys home,

37:36.426 --> 37:37.393
"call the show.

37:37.427 --> 37:39.187
It's Luke P."

37:39.222 --> 37:41.604
You know, I did have
a target on my back of being,

37:41.638 --> 37:43.847
you know, "frontrunner,"

37:43.882 --> 37:45.815
getting the First Impression
Rose.

37:45.849 --> 37:47.955
How is that not gonna
tick you off?

37:47.989 --> 37:51.372
In my shoes, it was like
anything I said,

37:51.407 --> 37:53.547
anything I did, any apology,

37:53.581 --> 37:56.895
nothing was going to work.

37:56.929 --> 38:00.139
And I did and tried my best
to do all of the above.

38:00.174 --> 38:02.141
- You said that
for whatever reason

38:02.176 --> 38:03.833
you have a target
on your back.

38:03.867 --> 38:05.835
We didn't place that target
on you.

38:05.869 --> 38:07.940
You put that target
on yourself.

38:07.975 --> 38:09.597
I feel like we gave him
a clear slate,

38:09.632 --> 38:12.186
just like we each gave
each other a clear slate.

38:12.220 --> 38:14.844
He just went completely
out of his lane,

38:14.878 --> 38:17.087
shall I say, um...

38:17.122 --> 38:19.331
but then you continued to do
stupid crap.

38:19.366 --> 38:20.505
- Yeah.

38:20.539 --> 38:22.334
- I feel that Luke
hasn't learned

38:22.369 --> 38:24.336
a thing whatsoever.

38:24.371 --> 38:28.616
I think that you are
a narcissistic

38:28.651 --> 38:31.481
cantankerous, misogynist.

38:31.516 --> 38:33.725
I think that
your future wife

38:33.759 --> 38:35.589
is gonna be a prisoner
of you...

38:35.623 --> 38:37.694
[audience "Ooh"]

38:37.729 --> 38:39.317
if you don't learn
how to change.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.801
- [clears throat]

38:40.835 --> 38:43.700
- We were coming from
a position of care

38:43.735 --> 38:45.875
and wanted to say,
"Hey, there might be

38:45.909 --> 38:47.117
some things you wanna
change up."

38:47.152 --> 38:48.947
You never did,
and you still haven't shown

38:48.981 --> 38:50.017
that you have changed tonight.

38:50.051 --> 38:53.089
[applause]

38:55.643 --> 38:56.989
- I mean, first off,

38:57.024 --> 38:59.095
wanna give you
the only compliment

38:59.129 --> 39:00.407
of the night
that you're gonna get

39:00.441 --> 39:03.375
and just say that I do respect
you being here,

39:03.410 --> 39:06.205
'cause you're about to step
into a firestorm.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.726
But secondly, like,
every single week

39:09.761 --> 39:11.659
there's a different event,
different situation,

39:11.694 --> 39:13.212
that you had to apologize for.

39:13.247 --> 39:14.628
And honestly,
it is one of those things

39:14.662 --> 39:15.974
that actions speak
louder than words.

39:16.008 --> 39:18.217
And we were waiting
for your actions to change,

39:18.252 --> 39:20.219
but nothing ever changed
in what you did.

39:20.254 --> 39:22.567
And so, you know, honestly,

39:22.601 --> 39:23.602
I wish I had said this
earlier to you,

39:23.637 --> 39:24.707
but just [bleep] you, man.

39:24.741 --> 39:26.778
Like, you--I mean...

39:26.812 --> 39:28.331
[cheers and applause]

39:28.366 --> 39:29.781
- [mouthing]

39:29.815 --> 39:33.543
- You--you're a liar,
manipulator,

39:33.578 --> 39:34.717
you're controlling,

39:34.751 --> 39:36.408
and you honestly are
a psychopath.

39:36.443 --> 39:38.237
And I think everything
you're about to hear tonight

39:38.272 --> 39:39.342
you deserve.

39:40.895 --> 39:43.622
- I know you guys were watching
backstage

39:43.657 --> 39:45.831
when I was talking
to Chris, and,

39:45.866 --> 39:49.835
man, it hurt me to watch
that season

39:49.870 --> 39:52.320
and to watch myself.

39:52.355 --> 39:55.116
And I did make it about me,

39:55.151 --> 39:56.463
and there's a lot of situations

39:56.497 --> 39:58.257
that I acted
out of my own character,

39:58.292 --> 40:00.156
and I was extremely prideful.

40:00.190 --> 40:04.160
I boldfaced lied
to some of you guys.

40:05.506 --> 40:08.613
I was extremely immature...

40:08.647 --> 40:10.925
and I realize those things.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.513
- So then why wouldn't you
change anything?

40:12.548 --> 40:15.309
- And I hope that you guys
can support me

40:15.343 --> 40:17.276
as I work on these things...

40:17.311 --> 40:18.623
- Stop changing your story.

40:18.657 --> 40:21.039
- And forgive me.

40:21.073 --> 40:24.663
- I completely do not accept
your apology

40:24.698 --> 40:26.285
that you just gave,
because 15 minutes ago

40:26.320 --> 40:27.528
when we were backstage,

40:27.563 --> 40:29.150
Chris asked you
a very respectful question,

40:29.185 --> 40:31.152
"Would you change anything?"
You said, "No."

40:31.187 --> 40:34.673
So why the hell would
any of us forgive you?

40:34.708 --> 40:37.538
- You're apologizing--well,
a five-year-old who gets caught

40:37.573 --> 40:38.608
with their hand
in the cookie jar

40:38.643 --> 40:39.747
is gonna say "I'm sorry."

40:39.782 --> 40:42.232
You always apologize
after the fact,

40:42.267 --> 40:44.269
and you don't take
accountability for it.

40:44.303 --> 40:48.273
Just the way you reacted
to her decision,

40:48.307 --> 40:49.654
it bothered all of us to see

40:49.688 --> 40:51.172
the way that you reacted
to that

40:51.207 --> 40:52.415
and tried to tell her

40:52.450 --> 40:54.555
what she could and couldn't do,
essentially.

40:54.590 --> 40:57.524
It's just, like,
it's her decision, man.

40:57.558 --> 41:01.217
Like, this is not up to you.
This is not about Luke P.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.425
This is about Hannah.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.463
[applause]

41:09.536 --> 41:12.297
- What you owe a big apology to

41:12.331 --> 41:13.988
is Peter, Jed, and Tyler.
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:14.023 --> 41:15.818
- For your actions,
the way you handled

41:15.852 --> 41:17.544
that last Rose Ceremony,

41:17.578 --> 41:19.511
it was just so out of
your character and--

41:19.546 --> 41:21.271
- Can I ask you what was
out of my character?

41:21.306 --> 41:24.171
- Luke, when someone says "no,"
means "no."

41:24.205 --> 41:26.138
Like, you're not here, like...

41:26.173 --> 41:27.381
[cheers and applause]

41:27.415 --> 41:30.833
I mean--I just...I mean,
do you guys agree?

41:32.110 --> 41:34.561
- That--that--that's
an excellent point.

41:34.595 --> 41:36.355
Yeah, I--
- I'm just saying.

41:36.390 --> 41:38.737
Dude, it's, like, she took
the frickin' rose stand

41:38.772 --> 41:41.602
and walked around you
and put it out here.

41:41.637 --> 41:43.293
And you said,
"Well, I need some clarity."

41:43.328 --> 41:45.503
What clarity--what else
you need?

41:45.537 --> 41:46.918
- It's 2019, man.

41:46.952 --> 41:48.885
You gotta wake up,
I want you to mature,

41:48.920 --> 41:50.438
and you can't talk to a woman
like that.

41:50.473 --> 41:51.439
Simple as that.

41:51.474 --> 41:54.304
[cheers and applause]

42:00.587 --> 42:03.313
- Luke, we didn't have
any immediate drama, you and I,

42:03.348 --> 42:04.936
but I for one am thankful
for you,

42:04.970 --> 42:06.972
because you're making me
look like a frickin' saint.

42:07.007 --> 42:08.387
[laughter]

42:08.422 --> 42:11.563
"No" means "no"
and "go" means "go."

42:11.598 --> 42:13.979
Did you ever apologize to him,
by the way, for that?

42:14.014 --> 42:16.430
Luke--Parker,
did you apologize to him

42:16.464 --> 42:17.638
for body-slamming him?

42:17.673 --> 42:19.053
- He did apologize to me.

42:19.088 --> 42:21.677
- Luke--Luke S.,
did I apologize to you?

42:21.711 --> 42:23.437
- You sure did,
but then the next night,

42:23.471 --> 42:24.887
you went ahead and...
- [chuckles]

42:24.921 --> 42:26.405
- You went
and told the group

42:26.440 --> 42:27.545
"I'm gonna go tell Hannah

42:27.579 --> 42:28.580
you're here
for the right reasons,"

42:28.615 --> 42:29.685
and then did
the exact opposite.

42:29.719 --> 42:31.203
- Right.
Looking back--

42:31.238 --> 42:32.308
- Well, why did you do that?

42:32.342 --> 42:33.654
- I...

42:35.794 --> 42:36.968
- [snorts]
- I...

42:37.002 --> 42:39.211
- [chuckles]
Oh, God.

42:39.246 --> 42:40.558
- It's a very simple question.

42:40.592 --> 42:42.698
Why did you do that?
- "I" is not an answer.

42:44.044 --> 42:45.252
- I don't know.

42:45.286 --> 42:47.081
- If I can just say,
for sure Luke messed up.

42:47.116 --> 42:48.427
Luke made
a lot of bad decisions,

42:48.462 --> 42:49.946
whether it was related to us,
related to Hannah,

42:49.981 --> 42:51.430
whatever it was.

42:51.465 --> 42:54.054
But at the same time, I mean,
even watching the episodes

42:54.088 --> 42:55.952
that I wasn't a part of
after Rhode Island,

42:55.987 --> 42:59.231
you could see the stress
and pain on Luke's face

42:59.266 --> 43:01.337
about being socially isolated
from the group.

43:01.371 --> 43:03.891
And I'm sure watching
these episodes

43:03.926 --> 43:06.411
and being humiliated on TV
was not easy.

43:06.445 --> 43:10.691
And to me, it feels like
he's already gotten

43:10.726 --> 43:13.452
the punishment for his actions.

43:13.487 --> 43:15.800
[applause]

43:15.834 --> 43:19.769
- Luke, I'll ask--I'll
ask this question:

43:19.804 --> 43:24.256
when you watched
the show back...

43:24.291 --> 43:26.914
'cause you clearly stated
that you weren't judging her

43:26.949 --> 43:28.709
and that that
was misconstrued...

43:28.744 --> 43:30.090
- Yes.

43:30.124 --> 43:32.264
- And I'm just curious,
because neither one of you

43:32.299 --> 43:35.509
were there as a virgin.

43:35.543 --> 43:36.579
- Yes.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.098
- Like, you've had sex

43:38.132 --> 43:39.547
and so has she,

43:39.582 --> 43:42.965
so why was that
such a sticking point then?

43:46.589 --> 43:48.384
Is there hypocrisy there?

43:49.627 --> 43:51.076
- Not at all.

43:51.111 --> 43:54.562
[laughter, murmuring]

43:55.633 --> 43:57.324
Think about what you're asking.

43:57.358 --> 43:59.050
Hannah--
[light laughter]

43:59.084 --> 44:01.431
Hannah and I both had
conversations

44:01.466 --> 44:03.744
about faith throughout
the whole process.

44:03.779 --> 44:05.573
And there is
something called--I mean

44:05.608 --> 44:07.541
there's many ways--you can
put it however you want,

44:07.575 --> 44:11.303
some people say
secondary virgin, some say--

44:11.338 --> 44:13.512
- Born-again.
- However you wanna put it.

44:13.547 --> 44:15.929
I was asking questions
through conversation

44:15.963 --> 44:17.896
to make sure that
I'm on the same page.

44:17.931 --> 44:20.450
And after I had asked,

44:20.485 --> 44:21.555
"Have you or have you not been

44:21.589 --> 44:23.108
sexually intimate
in these relationships?"

44:23.143 --> 44:25.663
And I was explaining to Hannah

44:25.697 --> 44:29.011
that my initial reaction
would be to want

44:29.045 --> 44:31.254
to remove myself
from the relationship,

44:31.289 --> 44:33.671
and that's because
that's me making

44:33.705 --> 44:35.155
a decision for myself.

44:35.189 --> 44:38.261
- You and I connected on our,
you know, shared faith,

44:38.296 --> 44:41.057
but after I left
and the way that you talked

44:41.092 --> 44:44.543
and the way that you walked
was not Christian-like.

44:44.578 --> 44:46.062
We all have our faiths.

44:46.097 --> 44:49.203
We all go about it our own way,
but I think to project

44:49.238 --> 44:52.966
that faith onto someone else
isn't the right way to do it.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.107
[cheers and applause]

45:01.871 --> 45:05.219
- I'll give you the final word
of anything you wanna say.

45:13.055 --> 45:14.953
- It hurts me to hear
that some of you

45:14.988 --> 45:16.748
don't accept my apology,

45:16.783 --> 45:19.302
and I want you to know
that I'm sincerely sorry

45:19.337 --> 45:21.270
about how it played out.

45:21.304 --> 45:23.997
And I really hope
that you guys can forgive me.

45:30.003 --> 45:33.178

thank you for being here.

45:33.213 --> 45:36.250
It couldn't have been easy
to come sit in the hot seat

45:36.285 --> 45:37.735
and take all of this tonight.

45:37.769 --> 45:39.322
And a little bit later,
I'm sure there's gonna be more,

45:39.357 --> 45:40.910
because you're gonna see Hannah
for the first time.

45:40.945 --> 45:43.326
All of these guys are gonna see
Hannah.

45:43.361 --> 45:44.776
So thank you for being here.

45:44.811 --> 45:48.090
When we come back,
Hannah will be here.

45:48.124 --> 45:51.438
What will she have to say
to men she sent home?

45:51.472 --> 45:54.234
And later, you know 'em,
you love 'em,

45:54.268 --> 45:55.407
we got bloopers.

45:55.442 --> 45:56.926
All that and more
when we come back.

for sex, Luke.

46:06.798 --> 46:08.524

the final word

46:08.558 --> 46:11.009
when Hannah faces Luke?

46:11.044 --> 46:14.116
- Are you really telling me
that you never said:

46:14.150 --> 46:16.152
"Don't judge me
about the Fantasy Suites,

46:16.187 --> 46:18.292
because I won't be using that
for sex"?

46:18.327 --> 46:19.466
[audience exclaims]

46:19.500 --> 46:21.468
- Luke is really obsessed
with sex,

46:21.502 --> 46:24.885
and I'm so over being
slut-shamed.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.198
Like, I'm not gonna stand here
and feel that way.

"The Bachelorette:
The Men Tell All."

46:43.593 --> 46:46.148

I'd like to say something,
Chris, real quick.

46:54.294 --> 46:55.605
- Just let it die.
Just let it die.

46:55.640 --> 46:56.883
- Yeah.
- Let him speak, go ahead.

46:56.917 --> 46:58.436

for everything

46:58.470 --> 46:59.747

to know that

47:01.335 --> 47:03.959
the whole process
was extremely tough for me,

don't know me.

support you in, you know,

what's to come after the show,
but I think once we see

47:19.353 --> 47:21.700
you've changed,
we'll accept your apology.

47:21.735 --> 47:23.288
- I agree.

47:24.496 --> 47:26.533

1:05:57.505 --> 1:06:00.335
And his love was contingent on

1:06:00.370 --> 1:06:04.581
if I did the things
that he wanted me to do

1:06:04.615 --> 1:06:08.654
as he saw as a wife should do,
not an unconditional love.

1:06:08.688 --> 1:06:11.519
- You talk about being shamed.

1:06:11.553 --> 1:06:14.522
That brings up the night
of your Fantasy Suite.

1:06:14.556 --> 1:06:17.697
- Mm-hmm.
- On that final date with Luke.

1:06:17.732 --> 1:06:19.285
Did you feel shamed
in that moment?

1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:21.805
- Well, yeah.

1:06:21.839 --> 1:06:23.945
Luke is really obsessed
with sex

1:06:23.980 --> 1:06:26.189
and the Fantasy Suites
being about sex

1:06:26.223 --> 1:06:28.363
and so I'll just tell everybody
my sex life.

1:06:28.398 --> 1:06:31.539
But honestly,
did I sit around being, like,

1:06:31.573 --> 1:06:34.024
"Huh, who am I gonna
have sex with

1:06:34.059 --> 1:06:36.061
in the Fantasy Suites?"

1:06:36.095 --> 1:06:37.234
No, I didn't.

1:06:37.269 --> 1:06:38.925
That wasn't something planned,

1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:40.099

1:06:40.134 --> 1:06:41.790
really was everybody's business

1:06:41.825 --> 1:06:43.068
to know.
- Right.

1:06:43.102 --> 1:06:45.104
- And it wasn't your business
to ever ask me.

that you never said:

1:07:01.569 --> 1:07:03.364
"Don't judge me
about the Fantasy Suites,

1:07:03.398 --> 1:07:05.573
because I won't be using that
for sex"?

1:07:05.607 --> 1:07:07.057
- I did not say that.

1:07:07.092 --> 1:07:10.854
Fantasy Suites aren't used
for sex, Luke.

1:07:10.888 --> 1:07:12.683
You didn't have one
so maybe you don't know,

1:07:12.718 --> 1:07:14.996
but the Fantasy Suites
aren't used for sex.

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:18.482
- That's my girl!
There you go!

1:07:20.105 --> 1:07:22.900
- And now looking back,
it wasn't just that moment.

1:07:22.935 --> 1:07:25.420
Like, I had been blind
to everything

1:07:25.455 --> 1:07:26.490
that had been happening.

1:07:26.525 --> 1:07:28.354
I did listen to you guys,

1:07:28.389 --> 1:07:32.600
but I knew if I had listened to
one of you guys say

1:07:32.634 --> 1:07:34.222
what he did,
I would always have, like,

1:07:34.257 --> 1:07:37.191
a "what if," or a--ugh,
that feeling

1:07:37.225 --> 1:07:39.193
when, like, you--when
a relationship ends,

1:07:39.227 --> 1:07:40.470
but there's still something
there.

1:07:40.504 --> 1:07:41.643
And I didn't want that
for myself.

1:07:41.678 --> 1:07:43.093
- You didn't make up
your own mind.

1:07:43.128 --> 1:07:44.474
- I didn't make up my own mind.
I'd just be listening

1:07:44.508 --> 1:07:45.716
to what was happening.

1:07:45.751 --> 1:07:47.408
I needed to feel it and see it
for myself.

1:07:47.442 --> 1:07:51.826
And that night I felt it

1:07:51.860 --> 1:07:53.310
and saw it for myself,

1:07:53.345 --> 1:07:56.589
and that was when it
just snapped for me.

1:07:56.624 --> 1:07:58.350
Now I'm like, "I will not
put up with this,

1:07:58.384 --> 1:08:00.110
"because that's not love,

1:08:00.145 --> 1:08:01.801
"that's not what the person
I wanna spend

1:08:01.836 --> 1:08:04.321
the rest of my life with
is ever gonna make me feel."

1:08:04.356 --> 1:08:08.049
And I'm so over being
slut-shamed

1:08:08.084 --> 1:08:10.638
and being felt like
that makes me

1:08:10.672 --> 1:08:12.778
not a woman of faith.

1:08:12.812 --> 1:08:16.161
Because--oh, my gosh, like,

1:08:16.195 --> 1:08:20.717
I live my life
and make mistakes and sin

1:08:20.751 --> 1:08:22.512

and so do you

and so do you

1:08:23.858 --> 1:08:25.929
and so do you,
but that's what grace is for.

1:08:25.963 --> 1:08:28.863
And I'm also not gonna say that

1:08:28.897 --> 1:08:31.728
me having sex in a windmill
was just, like,

1:08:31.762 --> 1:08:35.352
the scarlet letter
on my chest to have.

1:08:35.387 --> 1:08:37.527

and feel that way,

1:08:37.561 --> 1:08:39.184

feel that way

in my relationship,
