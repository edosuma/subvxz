A NETFLIX SERIES

00:22.083 --> 00:22.916
Rodrigo!

00:25.375 --> 00:26.208
Diego!

00:27.041 --> 00:28.208
Diego!

00:38.416 --> 00:39.250
<i>Diego.</i>

00:42.333 --> 00:44.583
<i>Diego. Help me, brother.</i>

00:45.833 --> 00:46.916
<i>Help me!</i>

00:49.166 --> 00:50.208
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

00:50.291 --> 00:51.750
<i>Danilo, listen to me!</i>

00:53.458 --> 00:57.250
<i>Danilo, stay with me! Don't go!</i>

01:02.666 --> 01:03.750
<i>Danilo!</i>

01:05.416 --> 01:06.875
<i>Danilo!</i>

01:12.666 --> 01:14.375
<i>Don't worry, brother.</i>

01:44.166 --> 01:45.000
Diego!

01:45.958 --> 01:47.041
Come back!

01:47.125 --> 01:48.583
Diego!

02:08.875 --> 02:11.000
You can do this.

02:37.208 --> 02:40.041
Oh my God.

02:50.833 --> 02:52.750
Calm down, relax.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.291
Come here!

03:37.000 --> 03:37.875
Miguel!

03:40.541 --> 03:43.708
I called you a hundred times.
You didn't see me surfing!

03:58.625 --> 04:00.041
What are you doing here?

04:13.916 --> 04:14.750
Marília!

04:19.166 --> 04:22.125
I called you the whole night.
Is Sofia okay?

04:22.625 --> 04:24.833
Let me know, okay? Bye.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.958
Think about my offer.

04:39.666 --> 04:43.708
After yesterday's debt, I guess
you don't have a lot to think about.

04:56.416 --> 04:58.041
So, Sofia wasn't delusional

04:58.125 --> 05:00.250
when she said you were selling weed.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.083
-Hey.
-Helena.

05:03.083 --> 05:06.250
I spent the night at the hospital,
I don't wanna talk.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.416
Look, I don't need a crystal ball

05:08.500 --> 05:10.708
to know this is a mistake.

05:10.791 --> 05:12.416
Specially because of Sofia.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.166
This guy is Sofia's dad.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.958
And this is Sofia's alimony.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.166
I'm sorry.

05:27.583 --> 05:30.791
-I didn't know.
-I've tried reporting him many times.

05:31.541 --> 05:33.833
He threatens to take me down with him.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.833
And now he came up with this.

05:37.416 --> 05:40.541
He has a paper saying
he'll pay me in cash every month.

05:40.625 --> 05:43.250
-So, is it resolved?
-Yes, sure.

05:44.541 --> 05:46.791
If I share Sofia's custody with him.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.833
Sofia's custody? Does he think you'll…

05:53.291 --> 05:54.125
No.

05:55.750 --> 05:57.500
You won't, right? For God's sake.

05:58.333 --> 06:02.541
I spent everything I had
to pay for the hospital bill.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.833
Now I'm drowning in debt,
and I have a kid to raise.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.833
I don't have a choice.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.833
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO FORMAT?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.250
RESTORING THE SYSTEM

06:35.875 --> 06:36.833
It's okay.

06:49.625 --> 06:51.291
Good morning, honey!

06:51.791 --> 06:53.750
-Morning, honey.
-You scared me.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.541
-These are for you.
-Really?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.000
Wow!

06:59.791 --> 07:00.916
They're beautiful.

07:03.666 --> 07:05.583
EVERYBODY DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE
RODRIGO

07:05.666 --> 07:06.791
I can't believe it.

07:07.750 --> 07:11.625
At least someone remembered you.
Miguel's gone and not answering my calls.

07:12.625 --> 07:13.500
That's weird.

07:13.583 --> 07:16.250
-I'll try his house. Can you cover for me?
-Sure.

07:16.750 --> 07:18.750
Did you wanna talk to me, Catarina?

07:18.833 --> 07:22.541
There's something wrong with the computer,
I think it's a virus.

07:22.625 --> 07:23.583
How come?

07:23.666 --> 07:26.375
All of a sudden,
it started to format itself.

07:27.833 --> 07:29.791
That's all I needed now.

07:30.791 --> 07:32.166
I think I got a backup.

07:34.166 --> 07:36.583
-I'm gonna figure this out.
-Okay, great.

07:36.666 --> 07:38.000
Flowers, Catarina?

07:38.083 --> 07:40.166
-I know, right?
-I like it.

07:47.750 --> 07:50.416
Wow! What a mess!

07:53.875 --> 07:56.458
Are you okay? I was worried about you!

08:00.333 --> 08:01.333
Conrado!

08:02.458 --> 08:03.416
What is this?

08:08.500 --> 08:10.208
Are you back? Is that it?

08:10.875 --> 08:12.916
I tried talking to my parents

08:13.000 --> 08:16.291
about what I lived here
and what I found out about me,

08:16.375 --> 08:18.291
but they didn't take it so well.

08:18.958 --> 08:21.583
You know we're in this together, right?

08:21.666 --> 08:22.708
Always.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.291
-Right, Miguel?
-I'm sorry?

08:27.041 --> 08:29.208
-We're together.
-Right.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.333
Yeah.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.208
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.166
-We need to talk.
-We need to talk.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.875
I wanted to apologize.

09:04.750 --> 09:08.750
I was pushy about going to Chile.
I didn't think about your plans.

09:08.833 --> 09:09.750
Can I talk?

09:12.875 --> 09:15.500
Yesterday, when I rescued Rodrigo,

09:16.541 --> 09:19.208
something happened,

09:21.458 --> 09:23.291
as if a weight was lifted off me.

09:24.416 --> 09:27.291
As if I had paid my debt with my brother,

09:29.083 --> 09:30.083
with the past.

09:31.916 --> 09:33.375
And now, I don't know.

09:35.541 --> 09:36.458
I'm at peace.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.958
I can finally look at my future.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.375
I also understood

09:46.625 --> 09:48.500
that it will only make sense

09:49.125 --> 09:50.375
if it's with you.

09:51.541 --> 09:52.500
What's this?

09:54.041 --> 09:55.125
A surprise.

09:59.083 --> 10:00.416
Diego-- Tomorrow?

10:00.500 --> 10:04.458
-Did you like it?
-It's tomorrow! You're crazy!

10:05.791 --> 10:06.625
I love it!

10:08.333 --> 10:09.375
I love it.

10:09.916 --> 10:11.833
It's never too early to start over.

10:11.916 --> 10:14.291
It's never too early to start in Chile.

10:14.375 --> 10:17.083
First stop: Santiago de Chile!

10:18.250 --> 10:19.166
Welcome.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.833
There's something I need to do
before we go.

10:35.208 --> 10:38.541
No, I can't leave everything here
to go there.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.208
That's impossible.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.708
Listen,

10:43.583 --> 10:45.791
my son just tried committing suicide.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.333
I'm her husband on paper.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.750
Why don't you just sign this shit, huh?

10:56.416 --> 10:57.250
All right.

10:59.541 --> 11:00.375
Okay.

11:00.958 --> 11:01.791
Shit!

11:03.333 --> 11:06.708
-Did something happen with Mom?
-It's ironic.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.833
She abandons her family,
and now she needs a relative

11:10.916 --> 11:13.000
to help her in Europe.

11:16.083 --> 11:18.750
I'm gonna bring Monica back
from her leave.

11:20.125 --> 11:23.208
Half of the department
will be on vacation next week.

11:23.791 --> 11:27.666
Fuck! The construction at the hotel.

11:28.958 --> 11:32.500
I can't let Vilma and Maresia
take care of it.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.708
They'll only create more trouble.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.666
-Hey, Dad.
-Yeah?

11:41.958 --> 11:42.958
I had an idea.

11:54.750 --> 11:57.250
What happened to your wrist? Are you okay?

12:00.333 --> 12:01.541
Carpal tunnel.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.166
I can't even move my fingers,
it hurts a lot.

12:07.416 --> 12:10.625
Well, what about you?
Do you need anything?

12:13.750 --> 12:15.000
Mom, I'm leaving.

12:16.958 --> 12:18.125
I knew it.

12:18.208 --> 12:20.458
-I need to go.
-Of course.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.666
You need to take care of your life, right?

12:25.458 --> 12:27.291
Is this how you're gonna react?

12:28.250 --> 12:30.000
You're being so unfair, Mom.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.416
You know what I had to do
to keep Hassef working on your case.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.250
The wedding would've solved it.

12:41.333 --> 12:44.458
Catarina! Please,
don't leave me here alone.

12:46.750 --> 12:49.500
I thought you couldn't move your fingers.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.541
Where would you go without money?

12:57.166 --> 12:58.125
To Chile.

12:59.791 --> 13:01.000
I'm going to Chile.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.916
With a really nice guy who I love,
and who loves me too.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.541
Let me guess.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.000
He's rich, right?

13:12.000 --> 13:15.125
Have you already told the poor guy
who you really are?

13:17.791 --> 13:19.083
Catarina, come back.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.250
Sweetie, you can run away
as much as you want,

13:26.666 --> 13:28.291
but you're just like me.

13:42.458 --> 13:44.666
Conrado, finally!

13:48.166 --> 13:49.833
Where's he? He told me to come.

13:50.875 --> 13:54.625
Yeah, he told me about Elias's goon.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.166
I wanted to see you.
Tell me. How are you doing?

13:59.708 --> 14:03.333
-We have nothing to talk about, Yasmin.
-Miguel, wait!

14:08.166 --> 14:09.583
I need to talk to you.

14:11.666 --> 14:13.583
Chai, my ex, he's been here.

14:14.208 --> 14:16.583
-We talked and--
-You talked.

14:17.833 --> 14:19.125
You didn't just talk.

14:22.791 --> 14:24.166
I saw you two kissing.

14:29.250 --> 14:30.083
Miguel!

14:31.666 --> 14:33.541
Look, I'm sorry. I…

14:36.291 --> 14:38.333
I made a mistake.

14:40.333 --> 14:43.750
It's hard to leave my past behind,
you know?

14:44.333 --> 14:47.375
-I'm trying to understand who I am.
-Good for you.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.250
But, besides being beaten,

14:50.333 --> 14:51.916
I lost my dad's medicine.

14:53.875 --> 14:55.000
On top of all that,

14:56.791 --> 14:58.333
seeing you kissing Chai

15:00.041 --> 15:02.875
made me have
the worst anxiety attack of my life.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.000
-I didn't want to hurt you.
-But you did.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.208
I've been having anxiety
since I lost my mom,

15:09.291 --> 15:11.666
and it's getting worse
with my dad's Parkinson's.

15:12.166 --> 15:15.166
I'm always trying
to hide it from everyone.

15:15.250 --> 15:17.583
-I had no idea.
-Yeah.

15:18.458 --> 15:19.541
Almost no one knows.

15:21.583 --> 15:24.500
See why I get away
from the things I can lose?

15:24.583 --> 15:26.166
You're not gonna lose me.

15:26.666 --> 15:27.541
I'm here.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.958
This island, this summer,
it all messed with my head.

15:33.458 --> 15:35.416
You messed with my head.

15:37.916 --> 15:38.750
Yasmin…

15:42.625 --> 15:43.708
we…

15:46.458 --> 15:48.125
we're just like the summer.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.833
It has an ending date.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.500
And, when it does…

15:58.750 --> 16:00.000
I'll be here alone.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.333
I'll put these in here.

16:16.500 --> 16:18.500
What's up? Have you packed?

16:19.375 --> 16:21.583
I'm trying to fit everything in here,

16:23.166 --> 16:24.458
but it's tough.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.791
I'm not packing.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.666
Are you doing it later?

16:35.875 --> 16:37.250
No, I'm not going.

16:40.541 --> 16:41.375
I'm sorry?

16:42.166 --> 16:43.041
What's wrong?

16:44.333 --> 16:49.125
Diego, you're the most special person
I've ever met.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.583
You're an amazing guy.

16:51.666 --> 16:52.833
I love you.

16:54.958 --> 16:57.875
And that's why
you deserve someone better than me.

16:58.458 --> 16:59.958
Why are you saying that?

17:03.083 --> 17:05.208
-Because we should break up.
-What?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.000
Before I change my mind.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.250
Catarina! Wait!

17:08.333 --> 17:11.750
Hey! What happened?
Did your mom say something?

17:11.833 --> 17:13.708
No, this is not about my mom.

17:13.791 --> 17:15.166
It's about what's right.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.291
-Which is the two of us together.
-No.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.500
-I'm sure.
-But it's not.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.958
What we have is real.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.666
But I'm not.

17:31.958 --> 17:33.541
I'll hurt you.

17:36.125 --> 17:37.333
You're doing it now.

17:37.833 --> 17:38.958
I'm sorry.

17:40.041 --> 17:40.875
I'm sorry.

18:14.125 --> 18:16.041
I heard you were back.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.416
I was really happy.

18:24.083 --> 18:24.916
Yeah.

18:26.875 --> 18:29.125
I had to go back to my parents' house

18:30.958 --> 18:33.916
to understand that my real home is here.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.416
This will always be your home, Conrado.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.875
Welcome back aboard.

19:07.541 --> 19:10.208
-Catarina? Are you there?
-Just a minute.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.125
Wait. What about Maresia's cottage?

19:22.125 --> 19:23.875
I don't wanna stay there, bestie.

19:24.541 --> 19:27.125
All I need right now is this bed.

19:28.666 --> 19:31.291
It was the first time
you called me "bestie."

19:31.791 --> 19:34.625
Look at how far we've come, right?

19:34.708 --> 19:35.916
Right.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.708
Okay, tell me. What's up with you?

19:40.291 --> 19:42.416
I've hurt Miguel, too.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.500
What do you mean?

19:44.666 --> 19:47.833
-Chai was here.
-Your ex? And?

19:49.666 --> 19:52.375
He was here, and I have the feeling

19:52.458 --> 19:54.791
that I've missed a chance to be honest.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.333
I took too long to apologize.

19:58.416 --> 19:59.666
Apologize for what?

19:59.750 --> 20:01.625
We were protesting,

20:01.708 --> 20:05.333
I went too far, broke a window,
and he took the blame.

20:06.583 --> 20:07.416
I see.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.708
I ran away, Catarina.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.875
It was the same thing with the boat.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.750
Miguel is paying for something I did.

20:19.541 --> 20:23.333
I've done nothing
but hurt the people I love, you know?

20:24.791 --> 20:25.625
I hear you.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.875
Sometimes we don't have a choice.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.416
Yeah.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
I don't think you're running away.

20:37.083 --> 20:40.916
It's quite the opposite,
you've coped with many things here.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.833
It's true. You've dealt with your dad,
with the sea,

20:46.291 --> 20:47.291
with love…

20:49.833 --> 20:52.458
And even with a spoiled brat
as a roommate.

20:52.541 --> 20:53.625
I mean it.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.416
And this colleague… I mean friend,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.333
I wanna keep dealing with her.

20:58.916 --> 21:01.000
As long as you can put up with my snoring.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.875
That's pretty hard.

21:02.958 --> 21:05.208
By the way, we need to go to sleep.

21:05.291 --> 21:07.333
Yes, it's been a rough day.

21:07.416 --> 21:09.916
-Good night.
-Good night, bestie.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.875
Hey, are you crazy?

21:47.375 --> 21:49.625
What are you doing? Wait.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.083
Don't do this.

21:52.583 --> 21:55.166
-Let me try it.
-Okay.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.416
Let's share. May I?

21:57.958 --> 21:59.125
-Sure.
-Okay.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.458
-Is it good?
-Delicious.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.000
Were you watching TV shows?

22:08.500 --> 22:09.333
No.

22:10.166 --> 22:13.166
Real life is keeping me up.
Can you believe it?

22:14.291 --> 22:15.291
What do you mean?

22:20.458 --> 22:23.041
"I'll be waiting for you
tomorrow morning."

22:23.666 --> 22:25.958
"Please come with me to Hawaii."

22:27.208 --> 22:30.708
It's a happy ending,
just like the movies. That's intense.

22:34.375 --> 22:35.208
Maybe.

22:36.041 --> 22:37.875
-Yes?
-And you?

22:37.958 --> 22:40.041
Why are you up? Nightmares?

22:41.750 --> 22:42.916
Quite the opposite.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.416
I was having a nice dream.

22:48.291 --> 22:51.125
But sometimes
that's worse than nightmares.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.166
I guess that, deep down,

22:55.250 --> 22:56.916
what we really want

22:57.583 --> 22:59.625
is someone to share our dreams.

23:00.875 --> 23:01.875
Right?

23:02.458 --> 23:04.708
But it's hard to find that person.

23:06.458 --> 23:07.583
If you do,

23:08.375 --> 23:11.083
hold on to them, and don't let them go.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.041
It's almost over.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.791
I'm glad I didn't throw it away.
You saved the ice cream.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.166
Special effects.

23:24.916 --> 23:25.833
Color.

23:53.916 --> 23:55.250
Good morning, Dad!

23:57.208 --> 23:58.041
Dad?

24:06.208 --> 24:07.041
Dad?

24:48.000 --> 24:51.208
That was the last dose.
The only one I managed to save.

24:51.291 --> 24:54.666
Look. Do you still remember the technique?

24:54.750 --> 24:57.750
You should've saved it
for a crisis or something.

24:57.833 --> 24:59.750
Do you know what animal is this?

25:01.625 --> 25:02.625
A dragonfly.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.458
It's a mayfly.

25:04.541 --> 25:07.958
It has the shortest lifespan on Earth.
Only 24 hours.

25:08.041 --> 25:10.208
-Here we go.
-One day.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.500
Please, Dad!

25:11.583 --> 25:15.208
The most important moment is right now.

25:15.291 --> 25:17.083
Don't worry about tomorrow.

25:17.708 --> 25:19.791
Or you'll regret it later.

25:20.541 --> 25:21.375
Look at this.

25:23.958 --> 25:24.875
Right now, huh?

25:27.791 --> 25:31.375
You're right. Dad, I need to fix
something bad I did.

25:31.458 --> 25:32.375
Miguel!

25:34.375 --> 25:35.541
But, before that,

25:36.833 --> 25:38.750
I'll show you how it's done.

25:40.166 --> 25:41.000
Look!

25:46.916 --> 25:48.250
Yes, Miguel!

25:57.875 --> 25:59.083
EISHENBERGER LAW FIRM

25:59.166 --> 26:03.458
We'll sign this paper, and you'll get
to spend more time with your dad.

26:03.541 --> 26:04.875
I wanna stay with you.

26:04.958 --> 26:06.208
With you only.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.416
You can't today, honey.

26:09.041 --> 26:11.291
On certain days, you can't. All right?

26:11.375 --> 26:13.666
Come here. Pay attention.

26:13.750 --> 26:17.000
The ointment for your allergies
is in here.

26:17.083 --> 26:19.666
Don't forget. You can't eat shrimp

26:19.750 --> 26:22.625
and you have to do your homework, okay?

26:23.125 --> 26:25.625
Please. Your dad won't remember this.

26:26.416 --> 26:27.791
-Okay.
-Okay?

26:27.875 --> 26:30.291
-I love you.
-I love you too, sweetie.

27:11.416 --> 27:12.250
<i>Wait!</i>

27:13.708 --> 27:14.666
Marília!

27:16.000 --> 27:16.833
Don't go!

27:16.916 --> 27:19.958
Weren't you supposed
to be going to Hawaii?

27:20.041 --> 27:22.041
You always say I dream too much,

27:22.125 --> 27:25.250
that I'm in my own world,
and I need to go back to reality.

27:25.333 --> 27:28.625
But to live without dreaming
is no fun at all.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.625
I watched a TV show, <i>The Associates</i>,

27:31.708 --> 27:35.041
about two strong women
who face life together.

27:35.125 --> 27:38.375
Lovers, parents,
gang bosses, even dragons--

27:38.458 --> 27:41.166
-I love dragons!
-Oh really?

27:41.250 --> 27:42.166
Helena, please.

27:42.250 --> 27:45.666
-I'm really late. Could you--
-Okay.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.208
Let me pay your hospital debt.

27:51.625 --> 27:52.541
What?

27:53.125 --> 27:56.166
I've been saving to have another surgery

27:57.166 --> 27:59.333
to remove my liposuction scar.

28:00.791 --> 28:03.416
But my life turned upside down
and now I have

28:04.708 --> 28:05.833
a best friend.

28:06.875 --> 28:09.333
She showed me that I don't need this.

28:09.416 --> 28:11.375
That my body is perfect

28:12.208 --> 28:13.458
and I'm beautiful.

28:14.333 --> 28:15.166
Remember?

28:17.708 --> 28:20.916
-You know I can't pay you back, right?
-Yes, you can.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.583
We'll save money together,

28:24.666 --> 28:26.958
and we'll open our own yoga studio.

28:27.625 --> 28:28.541
So?

28:29.416 --> 28:30.416
Deal?

28:31.291 --> 28:32.416
Are you serious?

28:38.125 --> 28:39.375
But before that,

28:39.458 --> 28:42.625
you'll watch a documentary
about a mom who sues her ex.

28:42.708 --> 28:46.583
-All right?
-Okay. Sure. I promise.

28:47.375 --> 28:50.250
-Honey, come here!
-I'm not going to my dad's?

28:50.333 --> 28:51.833
-No!
-Yay!

29:11.041 --> 29:14.583
Where's your manager?
Catarina is not at the reception desk.

29:15.500 --> 29:19.333
Sorry to disappoint you,
but Catarina is not my manager.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.041
She's my colleague.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.625
Colleague? That's not what she told me.

29:24.208 --> 29:26.125
Good morning, Mrs. Paula!

29:26.208 --> 29:30.333
In this hotel, we work as a team.
Right? All of us together.

29:30.416 --> 29:33.083
That's why we don't have a manager.

29:33.166 --> 29:35.250
And that's why this place is a mess.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.333
You say this is a boutique hotel,

29:37.416 --> 29:40.208
and I ended up in a hippie village.

29:41.333 --> 29:44.000
-Is there a problem?
-Yes, many.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.458
You took so long to answer me
about my credit card,

29:47.541 --> 29:50.541
that my bank found out
the purchase was made here.

29:50.625 --> 29:52.375
I'm sorry. What purchase?

30:04.208 --> 30:08.583
You know what else the bank found out?
They didn't buy just a necklace.

30:08.666 --> 30:12.458
They bought a lot of stuff
that were delivered here at the hotel.

30:18.458 --> 30:21.166
<i>Since they'll be</i>
<i>in next month's statement,</i>

30:21.666 --> 30:23.166
I didn't find out sooner.

30:45.750 --> 30:48.000
Our system is safe, it doesn't fail.

30:48.083 --> 30:50.416
I'm telling you that someone did this.

30:50.500 --> 30:53.875
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.
Nobody here did this.

30:53.958 --> 30:57.583
This misunderstanding
is none of my concern anymore.

30:58.125 --> 31:00.916
-What do you mean?
-It's the police's.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.041
Excuse me?

31:26.458 --> 31:29.291
Maresia, I'm at your office.
I wanna talk to you.

31:31.666 --> 31:35.416
Why don't we go to the office
to talk and check this out?

31:35.500 --> 31:38.625
-There's no need to call the police.
-I'm done waiting.

31:38.708 --> 31:40.375
Did you call us?

31:40.958 --> 31:42.000
-Mrs. Paula?
-Me.

31:42.083 --> 31:44.666
Hi. Sorry.
Nobody stole anything, all right?

31:44.750 --> 31:46.958
I trust the staff with my life.

31:47.041 --> 31:50.041
If it wasn't your staff, who was it?

31:50.125 --> 31:52.708
-Are you the hotel owner?
-Yes.

31:52.791 --> 31:56.083
Please come to the station
to give us a statement.

31:56.166 --> 31:59.041
-Wait. Dad, you can't go.
-Calm down.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.708
-You can't take him.
-Come.

32:00.791 --> 32:02.666
Send a message to the staff.

32:02.750 --> 32:03.583
It's okay.

32:03.666 --> 32:06.083
I'll talk to them, and we'll solve this.

32:12.291 --> 32:14.833
HELENA: GUYS, HELP!
WE'RE BEING ACCUSED OF THEFT!

32:24.291 --> 32:26.458
Thanks. The next tour is at 3:00 p.m.

32:26.541 --> 32:28.083
-Great.
-Perfect. See you.

32:30.541 --> 32:31.375
What's this?

32:31.458 --> 32:34.208
HELENA: GUYS, HELP!
WE'RE BEING ACCUSED OF THEFT!

32:40.458 --> 32:43.708
Can't we solve this another way?
Why don't we check our registers?

32:43.791 --> 32:45.958
-Why are you doing this?
-I was robbed!

32:46.041 --> 32:49.000
You can't take my dad.
We didn't do anything.

32:49.083 --> 32:52.375
I found her wallet
and gave it back. Right?

32:52.458 --> 32:54.916
Did you have access to her credit cards?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.583
Whoever works at the reception has.

32:57.666 --> 32:59.166
It doesn't mean anything.

32:59.250 --> 33:01.500
Great! My cards were with a bunch of--

33:01.583 --> 33:03.708
-A bunch of…
-A bunch of what?

33:08.833 --> 33:11.458
You should measure your words,

33:11.541 --> 33:13.125
racism is also a crime.

33:13.208 --> 33:17.083
Hey! Let's try to keep calm, okay?

33:17.166 --> 33:20.833
You let these people
do whatever they want.

33:20.916 --> 33:25.166
These people are human beings,
with stories, talents and character.

33:30.458 --> 33:32.000
We do have our flaws.

33:34.083 --> 33:36.666
But we never judge people
by their appearance.

33:39.125 --> 33:40.708
Your speech was beautiful,

33:42.125 --> 33:43.791
but I'll stick to my report.

33:44.875 --> 33:46.958
So, you and Mrs. Paula

33:47.041 --> 33:49.291
must follow me to the police station.

33:49.375 --> 33:51.250
-No. You can't do this.
-What?

33:51.333 --> 33:53.416
It was a misunderstanding!

33:53.500 --> 33:56.666
-Why?
-Maresia? No, it can't be.

33:56.750 --> 33:57.750
I did it.

34:02.125 --> 34:02.958
I did it.

34:04.541 --> 34:05.791
I made the purchases.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.666
I was an idiot.

34:28.375 --> 34:31.000
This crazy idea about family…

34:31.750 --> 34:34.125
Baby, you stood up
for what you believe in.

34:34.666 --> 34:36.291
I allowed Catarina to stay.

34:36.833 --> 34:40.916
-She was our employee of the month!
-Yeah, but I didn't see the signs.

34:41.416 --> 34:45.083
You know? Sometimes I feel like
I wanna be naive.

34:46.041 --> 34:48.250
-Don't you think?
-I do.

34:49.208 --> 34:52.083
I'm not gonna lie.
It drives me crazy sometimes.

34:53.041 --> 34:55.416
But it also makes me love you even more.

34:57.291 --> 34:59.833
So, that's why without telling me,

35:00.750 --> 35:03.583
you decided to get this DNA test?

35:04.833 --> 35:07.500
You don't believe I'm her dad, right?

35:09.458 --> 35:12.541
-Maresia, honey--
-It was to protect me. I know.

35:13.083 --> 35:15.958
When were you gonna tell me
about this DNA test?

35:17.916 --> 35:18.750
Huh?

35:23.375 --> 35:24.416
Yasmin…

35:36.291 --> 35:37.208
Catarina.

35:39.083 --> 35:39.958
Let's do this.

35:42.125 --> 35:42.958
When you're ready.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.666
I know what you're thinking.

35:56.208 --> 35:58.208
Why the rich girl had to steal?

35:58.791 --> 35:59.625
Right?

36:03.583 --> 36:05.500
I'm not pretending I'm innocent.

36:06.541 --> 36:08.333
I knew it was wrong.

36:13.541 --> 36:16.041
But I also know rich people very well.

36:17.791 --> 36:20.708
When you spend too much money
on your credit card,

36:21.541 --> 36:25.875
you don't notice
when ten or 30 thousand are missing.

36:30.208 --> 36:32.208
Everything I bought was beautiful.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.291
But it wasn't for me.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.875
I didn't want those things.

36:38.208 --> 36:40.333
Since I came to this island,

36:41.208 --> 36:45.166
I've made friends who showed me
those were just things.

36:54.666 --> 36:56.708
And after everything I've lived here,

36:57.791 --> 36:59.875
I had many reasons not to do that.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.541
But I had one…

37:14.416 --> 37:16.125
I had one reason to do it.

37:24.291 --> 37:26.208
Yasmin, honey.

37:28.083 --> 37:29.208
Think about it.

37:36.208 --> 37:37.541
You know what's funny?

37:39.541 --> 37:42.916
It's like this island is trying
to kick me out since I got here.

37:44.208 --> 37:48.708
It's like it didn't want me
to call it home, you know?

37:49.541 --> 37:52.416
Yasmin, no home is born ready.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.541
We are the ones who build it,
brick by brick.

38:00.291 --> 38:02.333
There's no sea in São Paulo.

38:03.208 --> 38:04.291
But

38:05.875 --> 38:08.375
I'll go to college in Rio, right?

38:11.666 --> 38:13.041
I'm so lost that I…

38:13.916 --> 38:15.000
I don't even know.

38:15.583 --> 38:16.583
So, stay.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.958
Go to college in Florianópolis.

38:20.041 --> 38:22.750
Let's show this place it is your home.

38:25.958 --> 38:27.833
Can I ask you a question?

38:30.875 --> 38:31.750
Why do you…

38:32.625 --> 38:34.041
why do you still try?

38:36.000 --> 38:38.833
You don't even believe you're my real dad.

38:43.833 --> 38:44.750
Here.

38:48.375 --> 38:51.208
Do whatever you want with this.
I didn't open it.

38:52.708 --> 38:55.000
I already have the answer I need.

39:21.250 --> 39:23.166
I told you I was going to hurt you.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.333
Why?

40:25.791 --> 40:26.916
I'm sorry.

40:31.916 --> 40:32.750
Come on.

40:43.458 --> 40:44.291
Yasmin!

40:45.583 --> 40:46.833
Yasmin, I was wrong!

40:48.708 --> 40:50.791
We're much more than the summer.

40:53.791 --> 40:55.250
She left, Miguel.

41:00.500 --> 41:01.333
But…

41:03.625 --> 41:04.458
It's okay.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.500
This hotel

41:47.875 --> 41:49.750
is like a boat

41:49.833 --> 41:54.125
that helps people reach their destination.

41:59.208 --> 42:02.125
<i>But, right now, this boat is adrift.</i>

42:09.208 --> 42:11.416
<i>So, we need your help</i>

42:12.583 --> 42:15.500
to find the destiny of this hotel.

42:16.958 --> 42:17.791
With me,

42:19.666 --> 42:20.666
with Vilma,

42:22.958 --> 42:24.250
and Rodrigo.

42:26.041 --> 42:28.541
He'll be one of the managers now.

42:30.125 --> 42:32.000
I know what you're thinking.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.166
That my dad put me here.

42:35.958 --> 42:39.291
But I wanna prove to you
that I'm not like him.

42:43.375 --> 42:44.875
This is the time.

42:45.458 --> 42:48.375
We need to know
who wants to stay on board.

42:54.125 --> 42:56.708
FANUCCI LABORATORIES

43:10.416 --> 43:13.291
<i>What makes a family?</i>

43:14.208 --> 43:17.083
<i>Blood? Or is it something deeper?</i>

43:21.041 --> 43:23.000
<i>We have our birth family,</i>

43:24.541 --> 43:26.458
<i>we also have the family we choose.</i>

43:28.875 --> 43:29.833
What's up, guys?

43:32.583 --> 43:35.750
<i>And, if we're lucky, they choose us too.</i>

43:39.708 --> 43:43.375
<i>It's this family that makes you smile</i>
<i>when you're sad.</i>

43:46.166 --> 43:48.541
<i>They support you when you need the most.</i>

43:54.291 --> 43:56.666
<i>And take care of you when you're hurt.</i>

44:02.291 --> 44:06.083
<i>They bring you back to reality</i>
<i>when you're living in an illusion.</i>

44:09.166 --> 44:10.500
I'm going to Santiago.

44:12.875 --> 44:14.208
I'm going back home.

44:15.625 --> 44:17.916
I'm gonna finish medical school.

44:20.291 --> 44:21.125
That's great.

44:22.541 --> 44:23.416
Go

44:24.625 --> 44:25.875
with your heart open

44:26.500 --> 44:27.583
to whatever happens.

44:31.625 --> 44:33.333
'Cause what's meant to be yours

44:34.750 --> 44:36.166
the sea will bring back.

44:58.875 --> 44:59.708
Guys,

45:00.416 --> 45:03.750
I mean it. It's forbidden to be sad.

45:03.833 --> 45:04.666
Come on!

45:06.875 --> 45:08.125
Diego!

45:10.083 --> 45:11.166
My friend!

45:16.416 --> 45:19.041
Guys, Catarina sent a message.

45:22.208 --> 45:24.291
<i>I let you all down.</i>

45:25.291 --> 45:29.125
<i>I hope someday I can tell you</i>
<i>what made me do this.</i>

45:30.000 --> 45:32.791
<i>But, first, I need to pay for my mistakes.</i>

45:33.416 --> 45:34.416
<i>Until then,</i>

45:35.333 --> 45:37.458
<i>I wanted you to know</i>

45:37.541 --> 45:41.458
<i>that it was because of all of you,</i>
<i>my family from Maresia Hotel,</i>

45:42.125 --> 45:43.791
<i>that this was the best</i>

45:44.291 --> 45:46.166
<i>and most important</i>

45:46.250 --> 45:47.958
<i>summer of my life.</i>
