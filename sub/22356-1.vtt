01:18.167 --> 01:20.042
Do you want to go again?

01:20.125 --> 01:22.500
Mmm. I think I'm good here.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.875
Yeah? Just me then.

01:28.125 --> 01:30.125
What, are we going to stay here forever?

01:30.208 --> 01:31.583
Come on.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.542
<i>Okay. I'm ready to begin.</i>

03:04.875 --> 03:07.042
<i>Exceptional academic record...</i>

03:07.500 --> 03:09.375
<i>ending four years ago.</i>

03:10.208 --> 03:11.208
<i>My brother.</i>

03:12.958 --> 03:13.958
Jared.

03:15.917 --> 03:18.018
<i>I remember hearing about that. 
My condolences.</i>

03:18.042 --> 03:19.833
<i>Well, he survived, actually.</i>

03:20.458 --> 03:22.083
<i>Oh, I wasn't aware.</i>

03:22.167 --> 03:23.458
<i>That's okay.</i>

03:28.208 --> 03:29.917
Now, this technology...

03:30.000 --> 03:31.292
We've read the literature,

03:31.375 --> 03:33.250
classification is proving difficult.

03:34.458 --> 03:38.083
Can you tell us how it differs
from other controlled substances?

03:38.167 --> 03:39.958
To begin with, it's not a drug. It's...

03:40.042 --> 03:41.458
Biological software.

03:41.958 --> 03:44.125
You program new memories.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.458
We create experiences.

03:46.542 --> 03:48.708
Indistinguishable from the real thing.

03:48.792 --> 03:50.333
As far as the brain is concerned,

03:50.417 --> 03:53.500
fantasy and reality
are chemically identical.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.708
Good morning.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.667
Good morning.

05:35.417 --> 05:38.500
Ren, there you are.
Take a look at this.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.250
Oi! Get to work.

05:44.083 --> 05:45.958
Why are you pulling out my designs?

06:04.375 --> 06:05.958
Ren!

06:06.792 --> 06:08.542
Approvals. Clear your queue.

06:09.958 --> 06:11.500
Yeah. I can give you 30.

06:11.583 --> 06:13.042
Whoo!

06:30.333 --> 06:32.184
<i>The most published
expert on this technology</i>

06:32.208 --> 06:33.625
is your father.

06:33.708 --> 06:36.708
He's been quite vocal
about the dangers involved.

06:36.792 --> 06:39.333
He writes here, "Prolonged exposure

06:39.417 --> 06:41.458
<i>"could lead to a range
of physical symptoms,</i>

06:41.542 --> 06:44.583
<i>"from arrhythmia to seizures,
even brain death."</i>

06:46.000 --> 06:47.125
That's right.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.667
<i>So there are risks.</i>

06:50.042 --> 06:52.708
<i>Abuse of any substance is risky.</i>

07:05.333 --> 07:08.458
<i>Your brain is already firing
billions of neurons a second.</i>

07:08.542 --> 07:11.833
<i>We're just giving them a script to follow.</i>

07:11.917 --> 07:14.500
<i>The software builds from
fragments of your subconscious.</i>

07:14.583 --> 07:18.167
<i>It becomes part of you
like any other memory.</i>

07:18.250 --> 07:21.625
<i>We tell you the story of a day, one day,</i>

07:21.708 --> 07:24.750
<i>where everything happens
just the way it should.</i>

07:24.833 --> 07:26.458
<i>Perfect.</i>

07:28.708 --> 07:30.458
<i>No chance of it
lasting any longer?</i>

07:32.333 --> 07:33.667
None whatsoever.

07:42.167 --> 07:43.250
Looking good.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.875
Render it.

07:51.667 --> 07:52.667
What's next?

07:53.375 --> 07:56.333
Mmm. Shredding fresh powder, brah.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.583
What?

09:24.042 --> 09:25.333
Oh.

09:25.417 --> 09:26.833
Fuck.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.542
Damn it.

10:26.583 --> 10:29.417
It's just code. It's just code.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.542
Stop.

10:35.417 --> 10:36.417
Yes!

10:37.458 --> 10:39.375
Are you okay?

10:41.042 --> 10:42.792
Six and a half days.

10:43.583 --> 10:44.583
Welcome back.

10:48.417 --> 10:50.083
That was a bad one.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.500
Maybe we should drop the Alps.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.167
- We've got bigger problems.
- No. Snowboarding stays.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.250
Sam's counting on it being a seller.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.708
Unpack it, back to code.

11:01.417 --> 11:02.792
I will debug tonight.

11:02.875 --> 11:05.208
- It's not a code problem.
- It's code.

11:05.292 --> 11:06.875
- Some brains...
- I can fix it.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.000
Okay, boss.

11:11.833 --> 11:13.792
<i>What are we doing with our lives?</i>

11:13.875 --> 11:15.583
<i>We never have enough free time.</i>

11:15.667 --> 11:17.667
<i>And when we do, it feels wasted.</i>

11:18.292 --> 11:21.458
<i>So, imagine if we could buy more.</i>

11:21.542 --> 11:24.042
Sail the Caribbean before work,

11:24.125 --> 11:26.083
snowboard the Alps over lunch,

11:26.167 --> 11:29.250
free dive the Barrier Reef
that same night.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.292
This is not a simulation.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.000
This isn't even the "next best thing"
to being there.

11:34.083 --> 11:36.583
This is a genuine experience,

11:36.667 --> 11:39.333
delivered direct to the brain
by our patented technology.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.667
Holidays, just the beginning.

11:44.375 --> 11:45.583
Where do we go next?

11:46.000 --> 11:48.500
Long-term, interactive...

11:49.333 --> 11:51.333
Imagine the possibilities.

11:51.417 --> 11:53.792
Training, rehabilitation, therapy,

11:53.875 --> 11:56.083
years of experience added to your mind...

11:56.167 --> 11:58.417
Like apps to a computer.

11:59.792 --> 12:01.958
All you have to do is decide,

12:02.042 --> 12:04.417
what will you do with your OtherLife?

12:06.167 --> 12:07.792
To explain how, please welcome

12:07.875 --> 12:10.458
the co-founder of OtherLife, Ren Amari.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.809
- Where have you been?
- Working on our release, Sam.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.292
Talk science. Go.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.750
Breakthroughs in nanite technology
have enabled us

12:19.833 --> 12:22.542
to accelerate
computer-brain communication.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.083
We use our entire brain.

12:24.167 --> 12:26.375
The pervasive myth that we only use 10%

12:26.458 --> 12:28.417
is based on its division of activity.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.625
Thank you for coming. It was great.

12:31.708 --> 12:33.625
You've got my number.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.750
- We need more testers.
- Nope.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.750
- Two extra servers back of house.
- No! Not happening.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.042
Ren, how many times are we going to...

12:48.125 --> 12:49.601
A week to go and we're still finding bugs.

12:49.625 --> 12:50.917
We need a reliable render farm.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.480
I'm telling you, we're out of runway.

12:52.542 --> 12:53.875
I thought that went well.

12:53.958 --> 12:56.208
Yeah, they wanted samples.

12:56.292 --> 12:58.375
I still couldn't give it to them, so...

13:00.500 --> 13:02.042
You pitched both restrictions.

13:02.125 --> 13:03.445
I knew you'd call me out on that.

13:03.500 --> 13:06.250
- Long-term? Interactive?
- Oh, come on, Ren.

13:06.542 --> 13:09.333
All the research says
that's the future of this thing.

13:09.417 --> 13:11.208
We're only hurting ourselves
by holding back.

13:11.292 --> 13:12.583
What was that about anyway?

13:15.917 --> 13:17.292
It's a potential lifeline.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.917
Whatever. I'll see you back at the office.

13:26.458 --> 13:27.458
Hey.

13:28.125 --> 13:29.583
Fuck.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.750
- You forgot.
- I have to work.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.643
That's all right. Do you want
to get a bite at the office?

13:33.667 --> 13:36.375
- I'm sorry.
- Oh. Okay.

13:42.625 --> 13:46.833
Users can become
trapped by the fantasy

13:46.917 --> 13:50.042
and disassociate from reality altogether.

13:50.875 --> 13:54.792
I don't know about you,
but to me, it seems confining.

13:55.667 --> 13:56.875
What do you mean?

13:56.958 --> 13:59.583
A facsimile of an
experience you've never had

13:59.667 --> 14:02.250
just feels... isolating.

14:14.167 --> 14:15.375
There it is.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.958
Damn.

14:22.292 --> 14:24.958
How do you do that?

14:26.542 --> 14:28.000
It just looks wrong.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.208
Really, we testing?

15:03.292 --> 15:04.542
Hey.

15:04.625 --> 15:05.917
New PB.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.333
What's your daily?

15:08.000 --> 15:11.083
- About 400.
- Oh, bullshit. Give me a number.

15:11.625 --> 15:13.042
Four eighty-two.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.292
Twenty days in a day, fucking goddamn.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.708
Are you working on base code?

15:28.083 --> 15:29.208
Nothing to worry about.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.167
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:34.250 --> 15:37.042
Sam asked me to finish
the report on long-term use.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.667
- He did?
- Yeah.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.708
I assumed you knew.

15:43.792 --> 15:45.042
You a part of this?

15:47.125 --> 15:48.708
It's just research.

15:48.792 --> 15:50.958
He asked, I thought it sounded cool.

15:51.042 --> 15:53.125
Plus, that recursive glitch
that we've been getting

15:53.208 --> 15:54.268
could work to our advantage.

15:54.292 --> 15:57.417
Maybe that's the key
to prolonged simulation.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.625
Don't go behind my back to Sam.

16:00.583 --> 16:02.625
Okay, well...

16:02.708 --> 16:05.333
Talk to him about that, I just work here.

16:06.042 --> 16:07.375
Obviously.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.625
You want to get a beer,
bitch about the boss?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.833
He's not my boss, he's my partner.

16:19.208 --> 16:20.333
Okay.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.000
- Danny...
- You know what?

16:23.083 --> 16:25.167
- Hey. Yo, yo!
- Yo!

16:28.417 --> 16:30.083
- Let's do it.
- Thirsty, man.

17:21.125 --> 17:24.083
<i>What about these papers
coming out of Europe and China</i>

17:24.166 --> 17:28.375
<i>discussing medical applications,
Alzheimer's, ALS, dementia?</i>

17:28.750 --> 17:33.000
<i>In theory, you should be able
to patch a damaged brain like software.</i>

17:33.083 --> 17:34.625
<i> But ethically complex.</i>

17:34.708 --> 17:37.917
You're quite literally putting
ideas into people's heads.

17:39.833 --> 17:41.083
Is that a question?

17:42.042 --> 17:44.667
You have no other
applications in mind

17:44.750 --> 17:46.500
for OtherLife?

17:47.333 --> 17:48.333
No.

18:16.625 --> 18:17.625
Jared?

18:18.875 --> 18:20.195
How's our boy doing?

18:22.875 --> 18:24.500
Yeah, he's good.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.125
Jared, big sis giving you any trouble?

18:29.917 --> 18:31.750
You let me know if she does, buddy.

18:33.292 --> 18:34.542
Good to see you again.

18:35.292 --> 18:36.625
His eye moved.

18:38.792 --> 18:40.875
Yeah. Yeah, he, um...

18:41.917 --> 18:43.458
tricks me too sometimes.

18:44.917 --> 18:46.208
See you again tomorrow?

19:00.875 --> 19:02.292
Good night.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.833
<i>Hey, didn't want to call</i>

19:23.917 --> 19:25.797
<i>in case you were working
or sleeping, but, uh...</i>

19:26.167 --> 19:27.393
<i>Thought you deserved to see how much fun</i>

19:27.417 --> 19:29.833
<i>you're missing out on down here.
Remember fun?</i>

19:30.458 --> 19:32.917
Such a romantic.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.917
Definitely should have
joined us. This is not you.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.208
Didn't expect
to see the real you.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.833
You'd rather do it by email?

20:09.458 --> 20:10.917
No, I wanted to talk.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.417
I simply presumed that you'd be too busy.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.417
Now? Of all times?

20:17.125 --> 20:19.042
Will you at least come down here?

20:27.250 --> 20:28.708
We launch Monday.

20:29.167 --> 20:30.500
OtherLife.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.125
Even the name suggests
some sort of opiate.

20:33.208 --> 20:36.000
Products need commercial
application to get funding...

20:36.083 --> 20:38.625
Regardless of what you have
to sell to get them there.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.083
Bringing joy to people
is a worthy ideal, I grant you.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.833
But then again,

20:46.917 --> 20:49.667
heroin was invented
to cure morphine addiction.

20:52.667 --> 20:53.833
I made progress.

20:58.500 --> 21:01.167
- Behavioral awareness?
- Maybe.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.167
His eye moved.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.917
It's just a twitch.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.583
- It doesn't sound like much...
- It's not.

21:13.667 --> 21:16.667
Okay, but if he's in there,
then all he needs is a way out,

21:16.750 --> 21:19.208
- just something to hang on to...
- Oh, please stop.

21:26.625 --> 21:27.985
Are you still getting that glitch?

21:30.458 --> 21:31.917
It's just bad code.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.625
Like addiction, PTSD,

21:35.708 --> 21:37.292
depression, that's bad code, too.

21:37.375 --> 21:40.167
Except the mind
is more than just a collection

21:40.250 --> 21:41.559
- of binary switches...
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.792
Here we go with your spiritual rationale.

21:43.875 --> 21:45.833
- Don't insult me.
- You have given up.

21:49.542 --> 21:53.250
I'm sorry, I have another class.

21:59.292 --> 22:03.500
You can't unplug him without my consent.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.750
I can.

22:08.542 --> 22:10.625
I'm not asking you for your permission.

22:12.542 --> 22:14.042
Just your support.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.858
Hey, Cass?

22:53.208 --> 22:55.833
- What's up?
- What's going on?

22:56.167 --> 22:57.792
Sam needed to quarantine.

22:58.208 --> 22:59.292
He said you knew.

22:59.833 --> 23:01.167
You didn't know.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.375
- Can you do me a favor?
- Anything, babe.

23:04.458 --> 23:06.542
Can you take my archives off the network?

23:07.167 --> 23:09.750
Yeah, uh, that's going to
unlink a lot of projects.

23:09.833 --> 23:11.167
- That's fine.
- Okay.

23:15.292 --> 23:16.601
Is this a creative meeting?

23:16.625 --> 23:18.750
- It wasn't in the diary.
- Yeah, I, um...

23:18.833 --> 23:21.750
I wasn't digging or anything, it's just...

23:22.167 --> 23:24.167
You said 482

23:24.250 --> 23:26.890
and we've gone through more than
twice that amount of nanite stock.

23:30.292 --> 23:31.583
Is this costing us?

23:33.500 --> 23:34.625
No.

23:34.708 --> 23:37.917
Just your time, energy and extra
strain on our infrastructure?

23:38.333 --> 23:40.000
What's the simulation?

23:41.542 --> 23:42.792
I don't have to tell you.

23:42.875 --> 23:46.625
I'm sorry, Ren, you do.
We are supposed to be partners.

23:47.792 --> 23:50.750
- It's personal.
- It's long-term, whatever it is.

23:50.833 --> 23:52.250
Short and linear, your words.

23:52.333 --> 23:53.809
- And now you're developing...
- It's an unproven idea.

23:53.833 --> 23:57.292
- But I am close...
- Close? We're live in five days!

23:58.917 --> 24:00.292
I'll leave you guys to it.

24:06.458 --> 24:07.458
Sit down.

24:08.292 --> 24:09.333
Listen up.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.125
Remember the lifeline
from yesterday's meeting?

24:14.208 --> 24:16.208
His name's Furlong McClean.

24:16.292 --> 24:19.458
Now, there's Department of
Corrections and there's him.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.542
- Corrections...
- He tells the minister

24:22.625 --> 24:23.851
where to spend the federal budget

24:23.875 --> 24:26.292
and he's prepared to put
money down, unencumbered.

24:26.375 --> 24:28.458
- Prison?
- It's a government contract.

24:28.542 --> 24:29.809
You're talking about a virtual prison.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.708
Confinement. Imagine it...

24:31.792 --> 24:35.125
A kid gets convicted, pays his
debt in the courthouse lobby,

24:35.208 --> 24:36.625
a few minutes later, comes back...

24:36.708 --> 24:39.375
Rehabilitated.
It's hard time without the time.

24:40.708 --> 24:42.792
No. No. No way.

24:42.875 --> 24:45.475
- Proof of concept's all we need.
- We're trying to broaden minds.

24:45.500 --> 24:46.625
Not put them in a box.

24:49.083 --> 24:52.417
Okay. So, you can have
your secret project,

24:52.500 --> 24:53.583
but I can't innovate?

24:53.667 --> 24:55.375
You want hardware and staff,

24:55.458 --> 24:56.726
but won't let me raise the capital?

24:56.750 --> 24:58.083
Not like this.

24:59.458 --> 25:02.333
Well, then get back to work
on the actual fucking product

25:02.417 --> 25:04.500
all these people are here to create!

25:30.958 --> 25:31.958
Hey.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.667
What's up?

25:37.125 --> 25:38.583
Nothing.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.583
- Hey, you need to slow...
- Don't!

25:41.292 --> 25:43.917
Do you want to go somewhere
and actually talk about it for once?

25:46.333 --> 25:47.417
No.

26:35.625 --> 26:37.167
I'll see you later.

26:46.458 --> 26:48.167
Do you want to see something cool?

26:50.083 --> 26:51.500
Whoa!

26:56.417 --> 26:58.167
Whoo!

27:07.292 --> 27:10.083
Uh...

27:12.375 --> 27:13.500
Oh...

27:13.958 --> 27:16.458
- I didn't think it'd be so real.
- Mmm.

27:16.542 --> 27:17.833
As real as anything else.

27:18.458 --> 27:22.458
Right. 'Cause memory is a chemical.

27:23.125 --> 27:24.375
Everything is.

27:26.500 --> 27:27.833
It's amazing.

27:34.583 --> 27:36.792
Go. Go work.

27:51.708 --> 27:53.375
Mind if I go again?

27:53.458 --> 27:54.458
Fucking Sam.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.333
He's still trying
to push this confinement app.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.417
Do you know anything else about it?

28:11.042 --> 28:12.625
Hey, Danny. Listen to me.

28:12.708 --> 28:14.167
It's just a glitch.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.917
Danny, you will be fine.

28:19.458 --> 28:20.750
Danny, can you hear me?

28:21.375 --> 28:23.542
Danny. Danny?

28:26.417 --> 28:28.083
Oh, fuck.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.000
Hey, wake up.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.625
Please.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.375
Danny... No, no, no, no, wake up.

28:37.458 --> 28:39.083
Wake up. Please.

28:43.125 --> 28:44.667
Oh, my God.

28:45.458 --> 28:46.958
Fuck!

28:50.625 --> 28:52.250
Yes! I need an ambulance.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.917
Thoroughly tested the drug
before administering a dose?

29:06.000 --> 29:08.250
It's not a drug, it's biological software.

29:08.333 --> 29:11.042
Sam, can we find counsel
who understands what we do?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.625
Nobody understands what you do,
that's the problem.

29:15.167 --> 29:17.500
- Did you check the software?
- I wrote it.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.934
So, our defense is going to be
that you don't make mistakes.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.375
Could you give us a minute?

29:30.500 --> 29:33.167
Is this what I think it is?

29:33.625 --> 29:35.875
- Is Danny okay?
- What happened?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.083
I don't know.

29:39.042 --> 29:40.417
Something I missed.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.750
- Please, can you see...
- Three years of human trials,

29:44.833 --> 29:47.208
twelve million in peer review from MIT,

29:47.292 --> 29:49.375
- Caltech, Tokyo...
- They missed it, too.

29:49.458 --> 29:50.976
Well, they never tested it
in the first place.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.250
Ren, what is it?

29:57.083 --> 29:58.667
It doesn't fit the adventure brief.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.310
I didn't think you would be interested.

30:02.958 --> 30:05.500
Right. You've been spending
thousands of hours

30:05.583 --> 30:07.625
off in your own little world.

30:08.708 --> 30:10.208
We're finished.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.833
This is going to destroy us.

30:19.292 --> 30:20.893
I hope whatever it is
you've been working on

30:20.917 --> 30:21.917
is worth something.

30:24.833 --> 30:28.375
What is your ambition
for this technology, Ms Amari?

30:53.125 --> 30:54.833
Ms Amari, this is Mrs Wilson

30:54.917 --> 30:56.500
from the Attorney General's office.

30:56.583 --> 30:57.458
A pleasure.

30:57.542 --> 31:00.142
- And Mr McClean...
- With the Department of Corrections.

31:00.417 --> 31:03.208
Amazing technology, Ms Amari.
Truly remarkable.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.000
They have enough to go to trial.

31:07.083 --> 31:09.000
Realistically, we're looking at 10 to 15,

31:09.875 --> 31:12.750
and while I'm sure
I could plea down, this...

31:12.833 --> 31:15.000
This is an offer of deferred prosecution.

31:16.125 --> 31:19.667
If you are compliant with the terms,
the state has agreed not to press charges.

31:20.167 --> 31:22.375
- Charges...
- Unauthorized human testing,

31:22.458 --> 31:24.500
drug fraud, malpractice...

31:24.917 --> 31:27.018
And all you have to do
is agree to be a test subject

31:27.042 --> 31:29.375
in the virtual confinement
program of one year.

31:30.667 --> 31:32.000
Sam, what have you done?

31:32.083 --> 31:34.042
The best I could
to save my lead programmer.

31:36.375 --> 31:38.458
No, no, no. Um...

31:38.542 --> 31:39.875
No, I am not compliant.

31:40.292 --> 31:42.500
Ren, these people
can keep it out of the press.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.101
They've agreed to inject enough capital

31:44.125 --> 31:45.417
to get us over the finish line.

31:45.792 --> 31:47.458
OtherLife can live.

31:47.542 --> 31:49.750
How long have you been
planning this behind my back?

31:55.292 --> 31:59.125
A year in virtual confinement
is a minute of your life.

31:59.792 --> 32:03.208
A minute to save everything.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.125
No.

32:14.667 --> 32:15.917
Ren.

32:16.458 --> 32:19.333
You gave Danny
an untested sample and he died.

32:21.167 --> 32:22.917
Consider the alternative.

32:50.333 --> 32:54.000
<i>The confinement program
is the longest simulation we've run.</i>

32:54.083 --> 32:58.125
<i>At 365 days,
it far exceeds our 24-hour limit.</i>

32:59.000 --> 33:02.125
The subject will be
in a limited environment,

33:02.208 --> 33:05.208
which includes food, hygiene
facilities and a daily reset,

33:05.292 --> 33:07.542
to give the brain a sense of continuity.

33:07.625 --> 33:09.500
There really isn't much more you need

33:09.583 --> 33:11.750
for solitary confinement.

33:14.875 --> 33:16.250
Are you ready?

33:17.792 --> 33:19.167
One year.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.625
On the dot.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.292
And you ran the exit routine?

33:24.917 --> 33:27.357
Sometimes you code these
circular module dependencies which...

33:27.417 --> 33:28.417
Ren.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.542
You ever had to use one of those?

33:33.625 --> 33:34.708
No.

33:35.375 --> 33:38.875
Base of the skull,
straight into the limbic.

33:39.625 --> 33:42.083
- Don't fuck it up.
- Is there a problem?

34:55.042 --> 34:56.375
Oh, shit.

37:02.042 --> 37:05.500
Separation of spaces.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.458
A view to an exterior.

37:10.042 --> 37:11.667
A window.

37:14.542 --> 37:18.708
Any kind of human interaction.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.500
No one can read this.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.542
Fuck!

37:37.625 --> 37:39.792
Fuck!

38:11.208 --> 38:13.208
Are we going to stay here forever?

38:27.542 --> 38:29.167
Mind if I go again?

39:25.542 --> 39:27.208
Do you want to go again?

40:19.333 --> 40:20.708
I'm not giving up on you.

40:23.583 --> 40:25.583
You're my little brother.

40:25.667 --> 40:27.167
I can show you a way out.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.542
<i>Frederick Martin, 2008.</i>

40:30.625 --> 40:32.750
<i>Woke by music after three years in a coma.</i>

40:32.833 --> 40:34.518
It's possible that during
long-term exposure

40:34.542 --> 40:36.458
the brain adjusts to small changes.

40:36.542 --> 40:38.625
The simulation becomes lucid.

40:38.708 --> 40:40.583
<i>Alice Thompson, 2012.</i>

40:40.667 --> 40:42.000
<i>A random change in her medication</i>

40:42.083 --> 40:44.083
<i>resulted in full recovery after two years.</i>

40:44.167 --> 40:46.167
A simple matter

40:46.250 --> 40:49.208
of invigorating subconscious data.

40:49.292 --> 40:51.708
<i>Jeremy Wallace, four years,
described the process</i>

40:51.792 --> 40:53.851
of rewiring his brain from
the inside to wake himself up.

40:53.875 --> 40:55.934
<i>A sufficient dose of the right
mnemonic trigger could produce</i>

40:55.958 --> 40:57.559
<i>a recursive process and then eventually...</i>

40:57.583 --> 40:58.750
Life can be restored.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.917
Full recovery

41:01.000 --> 41:04.708
from brain death.

41:04.792 --> 41:07.625
The will to live is connected to memory.
Memory is a chemical.

41:07.708 --> 41:11.208
Therefore life can be restored
through biological programming.

41:11.292 --> 41:12.375
Life can be restored.

41:12.458 --> 41:14.417
<i>You know he's gone.</i>

41:14.500 --> 41:15.917
His eye moved.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.917
<i>Oculocephalic reflex.</i>

41:18.000 --> 41:19.542
Mmm-mmm.

41:19.625 --> 41:21.292
No. He's in there.

41:21.375 --> 41:22.500
<i>He's gone.</i>

41:22.583 --> 41:25.250
<i>Everyone knows he's gone except you.</i>

41:25.333 --> 41:27.542
<i>- There's nothing you can do...</i>
- I'll restore function.

41:27.625 --> 41:29.250
<i>With snowboarding?</i>

41:31.750 --> 41:33.208
I needed funding.

41:33.292 --> 41:35.333
<i>And look where that got you.</i>

42:37.333 --> 42:38.542
What?

42:40.958 --> 42:42.542
No, no, no, no, no.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.542
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

42:48.333 --> 42:51.417
Byron. Your fucking code!

42:52.167 --> 42:54.000
The exit routine!

42:55.375 --> 42:56.875
The fucking exit...

44:21.667 --> 44:22.667
That's impossible.

46:23.750 --> 46:24.750
Hey!

46:45.292 --> 46:47.792
Shit. Fuck!

46:48.958 --> 46:50.708
Oh, my God!

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Long-term care, ward 10.

48:06.083 --> 48:09.250
You have a patient there, Jared Amari.

48:09.333 --> 48:11.333
<i>I need you to tell me if...</i>

48:56.875 --> 48:58.333
Motherfucker.

49:03.750 --> 49:05.333
Here it is.

49:06.583 --> 49:09.500
Missing person, filed last year.

49:10.125 --> 49:11.875
Filed, but never active.

49:12.375 --> 49:13.500
According to immigration,

49:13.583 --> 49:15.917
you've had residency in Italy
for nearly a year.

49:16.000 --> 49:17.083
It... No.

49:17.167 --> 49:19.083
No, I've been in a box.

49:19.167 --> 49:21.417
I've been in a fucking box
in the middle of nowhere.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.542
All right, take it easy.

49:23.625 --> 49:25.292
Tell us about this government programme.

49:25.375 --> 49:28.208
No, it's not... Okay,
it's not a government programme.

49:28.292 --> 49:30.292
- It's OtherLife.
- So you worked for them?

49:30.958 --> 49:32.292
No, it's...

49:34.000 --> 49:35.625
It's my company.

49:36.750 --> 49:38.500
Ah-ha.

49:38.583 --> 49:40.208
Ms Amari.

49:41.375 --> 49:43.292
There's no charges against you on record

49:43.375 --> 49:46.250
and there's no indication
of any deferred prosecution.

49:49.833 --> 49:53.125
Will you at least take a look at the cell?

50:03.083 --> 50:04.563
Go home, Ms Amari.

50:12.833 --> 50:14.250
I'm sorry.

50:14.333 --> 50:17.083
There's been a tenant
in your apartment almost a year.

50:17.167 --> 50:20.042
What about storage? All my research?

50:20.125 --> 50:21.292
I can't let you in.

50:23.917 --> 50:25.083
Cup of tea?

50:26.083 --> 50:27.208
Mmm.

50:31.125 --> 50:32.583
Fuck.

50:52.875 --> 50:53.875
Ren!

50:54.917 --> 50:56.792
Thank God you're okay.

50:56.875 --> 50:58.333
I came as soon as I heard.

50:59.208 --> 51:01.000
I know you're confused,

51:01.083 --> 51:03.333
but I can help you
figure things out. I promise.

51:04.375 --> 51:07.542
Hey. Let's get you somewhere safe, okay?

51:09.417 --> 51:10.833
I'm not safe?

51:14.542 --> 51:17.333
Hey! Hey! Can you open this, please?

51:18.667 --> 51:20.708
You're okay. Just go.

51:20.792 --> 51:22.083
Thank you.

51:22.833 --> 51:25.042
Go, go, go. Go around. Cut her off!

51:40.250 --> 51:41.833
Ren!

51:42.917 --> 51:45.458
Listen, there was nothing I could do.

51:45.708 --> 51:48.083
You're not making this
any easier for yourself.

51:49.750 --> 51:50.750
Fuck!

51:51.417 --> 51:52.958
Go that way. Go!

52:21.208 --> 52:22.417
- <i> Hello.</i>
- Cass.

52:23.292 --> 52:24.833
Cass, it's Ren.

52:26.708 --> 52:28.208
<i>Bullshit.</i>

52:31.917 --> 52:33.458
Oh, my God.

52:39.792 --> 52:42.375
You have no idea how good this tastes.

52:52.792 --> 52:54.500
You didn't think it was strange

52:55.125 --> 52:56.792
when I stopped showing up for work?

52:56.875 --> 52:58.208
Everyone said you cashed out.

52:58.292 --> 52:59.625
Without saying goodbye?

52:59.708 --> 53:02.833
Yeah. I deleted you from my phone.

53:04.458 --> 53:08.333
We all assumed you were off drinking vino
on the balcony of your villa.

53:08.417 --> 53:10.125
Do I look like I've been in Italy?

53:12.083 --> 53:14.792
No, you look like shit.

53:17.292 --> 53:19.083
So, where have you been?

53:22.167 --> 53:23.625
It'll sound crazy.

53:23.708 --> 53:25.542
It's all been pretty normal so far.

53:26.917 --> 53:28.417
Okay.

53:30.833 --> 53:32.875
After Danny died, they offered me a plea

53:32.958 --> 53:34.917
- to test the confinement...
- Stop. What?

53:35.000 --> 53:36.726
The sample I gave Danny
must have had bad code.

53:36.750 --> 53:38.667
- No. Hold on.
- Something that I missed.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.125
What?

54:34.500 --> 54:36.292
All I remember is drowning.

54:37.708 --> 54:41.000
I'd almost get out,
then I'd be under again, over and over.

54:41.417 --> 54:42.792
Then I woke up in hospital.

54:43.333 --> 54:45.458
They did tests for a week, but I was fine.

54:45.917 --> 54:47.583
I sent you a million messages,

54:47.667 --> 54:49.583
figured you just wanted to be left alone.

54:50.625 --> 54:52.625
Anyway, five days later, we launched.

54:53.417 --> 54:55.458
- I mean, it was wild.
- Yeah.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.750
First run sold out in three hours.

54:58.833 --> 55:00.473
Everyone's options went through the roof.

55:00.542 --> 55:01.875
Heaps in development.

55:01.958 --> 55:04.000
Education, military training,
huge budgets.

55:04.083 --> 55:05.750
And porn, of course.

55:06.792 --> 55:08.333
And what about confinement?

55:08.417 --> 55:10.792
It's the backbone of the company.

55:11.125 --> 55:12.726
They're legislating consecutive programs,

55:12.750 --> 55:14.750
stretching it to 10, 20 years
served in OtherLife.

55:14.833 --> 55:16.667
There's a senator in the US

55:16.750 --> 55:19.083
who's pushing for multiple life sentences,

55:19.167 --> 55:21.083
we're talking centuries.

55:22.667 --> 55:24.125
That's not what it's for.

55:25.250 --> 55:27.583
I need to see what they've done
to my software.

55:32.250 --> 55:36.667
Look, no one is happier
to see you than me.

55:37.667 --> 55:38.750
Really.

55:39.917 --> 55:41.375
But you're free.

55:42.375 --> 55:43.583
Walk away.

55:44.292 --> 55:46.417
We'll help you do it.
Money, whatever you need.

55:46.500 --> 55:48.559
If Sam's gone this far, who knows
what else he's capable of.

55:48.583 --> 55:50.643
- None of it matters.
- I'll come with you if you like.

55:50.667 --> 55:52.184
- I need to see that code.
- And then what?

55:52.208 --> 55:54.226
- I just... I need to see it.
- You need to regroup.

55:54.250 --> 55:56.250
Go somewhere safe, take your time.

55:56.333 --> 55:58.573
And then when you're ready,
we'll do everything you need.

55:59.000 --> 56:01.893
We'll get a lawyer, talk to the media,
expose how they stole your company...

56:01.917 --> 56:04.125
I don't give a fuck about a company!

56:12.500 --> 56:15.333
I could never understand

56:15.417 --> 56:19.417
why my father wouldn't just
fix him and bring him back.

56:20.375 --> 56:22.500
What's the point of being a genius

56:22.583 --> 56:24.292
if you don't do anything with it?

56:25.292 --> 56:28.917
And we needed money for research
and he kept turning down offers.

56:31.125 --> 56:32.875
So, I registered the patent,

56:33.542 --> 56:36.208
my dad's patent,

56:36.292 --> 56:38.208
and I started OtherLife.

56:40.375 --> 56:41.601
I was gonna do what he couldn't.

56:41.625 --> 56:44.583
I was gonna bring my brother back,
and we would be a family again.

56:45.042 --> 56:48.167
So, I don't care about a company.

56:49.292 --> 56:51.208
That is not what they stole.

57:31.292 --> 57:32.351
<i>Remember how you asked me</i>

57:32.375 --> 57:34.000
<i>to unlink all your research?</i>

57:34.708 --> 57:37.542
<i>Once you were gone, Sam put me
to work sorting through it all.</i>

57:37.625 --> 57:38.625
<i>He was convinced</i>

57:38.667 --> 57:40.458
<i>there were other applications
for OtherLife.</i>

57:40.542 --> 57:42.042
<i>He must've been withholding.</i>

57:42.125 --> 57:44.917
<i>It's all kept on a secure server,
level 20.</i>

57:45.000 --> 57:46.208
What about Byron?

57:46.292 --> 57:48.125
<i>He's on nineteen.</i>

57:49.000 --> 57:51.250
<i>Get to his office
and find an open terminal.</i>

57:51.333 --> 57:53.583
<i>I should be able to walk you
through hacking his account.</i>

57:53.667 --> 57:55.250
<i>His passwords are super obvious.</i>

57:55.333 --> 57:56.833
- Wait a sec.
<i>- Okay.</i>

58:09.500 --> 58:10.625
Shit!

58:19.000 --> 58:20.083
Okay. Okay, okay.

58:20.167 --> 58:22.208
<i>Who's that? Is that Byron?</i>

58:22.292 --> 58:23.833
<i>Ren, what's going on?</i>

58:23.917 --> 58:25.625
It's okay. It's okay, we're in.

58:27.875 --> 58:29.167
No, no.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.958
- Don't mess with...
- Sit down.

58:31.042 --> 58:33.750
No. No, no.

58:34.958 --> 58:36.417
It's not here.

58:36.750 --> 58:38.250
What have you done with it?

58:45.417 --> 58:47.875
Okay. Okay. Okay.

58:51.292 --> 58:53.792
Yay. Hooray, you found it.

58:53.875 --> 58:56.083
This is why you locked me up?

58:56.167 --> 58:58.047
What's this?

58:58.625 --> 58:59.667
We gotta go.

59:05.125 --> 59:06.125
Fuck it.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.625
Shit!

59:17.083 --> 59:18.750
Shit!

59:22.500 --> 59:24.708
Cass, we're in trouble.

59:29.167 --> 59:31.417
<i>Uh, guys...</i>

59:31.500 --> 59:33.292
<i>Take the car.</i>

59:33.417 --> 59:35.458
Don't fucking touch me.
Get your hands off of me.

59:44.083 --> 59:45.625
Get your fucking hands off me!

59:53.708 --> 59:55.708
Wait! Cass!

59:59.792 --> 01:00:01.792
Never mind. Ren, we gotta go. Come on.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:14.875
Is that it? Is that everything we need?

01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:16.417
I hope so.

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:18.958
We need a printer.

01:00:20.292 --> 01:00:22.750
The only printers in the city
are in that building.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I know where we can find one.

01:00:50.292 --> 01:00:51.292
Hello?

01:02:00.542 --> 01:02:01.667
What's all this?

01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:05.042
A lifetime.

01:03:15.042 --> 01:03:16.250
Well...

01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:19.458
This is fucking beautiful.

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:39.292
I don't quite know what to say to you.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:44.125
Neither of us ever did.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.042
I'm so sorry.

01:03:55.792 --> 01:03:56.792
I know.

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:07.708
Oh, fuck!

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:09.625
Danny.

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:33.583
Danny Lowe, this is my father,
Dr Robert Amari.

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:36.333
Hi, Dr Amari. I've read all your work.

01:05:36.417 --> 01:05:38.292
- The chemist?
- Yes.

01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:39.667
Good to finally meet you.

01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:42.750
Sam Murphy called my office.

01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:45.917
He was exceedingly charming,
so I knew something was amiss.

01:05:47.083 --> 01:05:48.500
What did you steal?

01:05:49.167 --> 01:05:51.375
It's my work, he stole it first.

01:05:51.458 --> 01:05:52.792
I know how that goes.

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:01.333
You filed the missing persons report.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:16.875
Jesus, I was scared.

01:06:21.833 --> 01:06:23.458
What did they do to you?

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.833
It all started with
Jared's diving simulation.

01:06:29.542 --> 01:06:32.708
A perfect recreation
of that day at the beach.

01:06:33.417 --> 01:06:36.042
You took it and you drowned.

01:06:36.667 --> 01:06:39.101
The software wasn't faulty,
it did exactly what it was supposed to.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:41.083
It gave you the experience
of being underwater,

01:06:41.167 --> 01:06:43.708
and then your brain filled in the rest.

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.875
The result was a seizure.

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:48.375
Right, but I didn't want to drown.

01:06:48.458 --> 01:06:50.417
But you didn't know that you had a choice.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:53.375
The point is,
the simulation wasn't linear.

01:06:53.458 --> 01:06:55.958
You were able to choose a path,
and subconsciously,

01:06:56.042 --> 01:06:57.792
you chose a bad one.

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:01.042
That's what I was trying to offer Jared.

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:02.708
Choice.

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:07.333
I was hoping that he would remember
the accident differently and...

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:08.542
wake up.

01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:13.417
What I created was a version of OtherLife

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.583
that lets you rewrite your memories.

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:19.208
That's dangerous. That's a drug.

01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:23.458
That's what they're refining.

01:07:24.167 --> 01:07:26.458
- Holy shit.
- They're not there yet.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:28.417
Byron's good, but he's not that good.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.059
Okay. Well,
we've got time to stop them.

01:07:30.083 --> 01:07:31.723
I'll call the TDA in the morning

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:33.708
and raise a safety challenge.

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:37.167
That'll tie Sam up in review
while we figure out our next step.

01:07:38.333 --> 01:07:41.167
How long do you think it'll be
before they finish this thing?

01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:52.042
Ren?

01:07:58.750 --> 01:08:00.350
You've already finished it, haven't you?

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:05.958
It's gonna work.

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:24.042
Jared.

01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:47.417
Hi.

01:11:20.458 --> 01:11:21.792
Jared?

01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:32.500
No, Jared.

01:11:32.625 --> 01:11:33.708
No, please.

01:11:33.792 --> 01:11:36.500
No, stop. Jared.

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:50.875
I wonder what he saw.

01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:56.167
Nothing.

01:13:59.167 --> 01:14:03.333
He hit his head on a rock
and he drowned in 20 centimeters of water.

01:14:04.042 --> 01:14:05.875
That's the last thing he remembered.

01:14:07.167 --> 01:14:10.542
Well, I saw a brain-dead
patient make an active choice.

01:14:15.292 --> 01:14:16.333
You saw?

01:14:18.375 --> 01:14:19.750
A drug like this...

01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:22.458
who needs to face reality?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.458
Byron.

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.458
Oh, shit.

01:14:41.042 --> 01:14:42.708
You told me no risk.

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:45.750
Oh, shit.

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:56.333
Wake up.

01:14:57.917 --> 01:14:58.917
Wake up!

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Shit.

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.542
Oh, Jesus, God! Thank fuck!

01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:15.000
Ren, you scared the crap...

01:17:15.083 --> 01:17:17.208
Oh, fuck!

01:17:17.292 --> 01:17:18.542
Shit!

01:17:22.042 --> 01:17:24.833
No, no, no! No, no.

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:28.000
Byron?

01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:53.542
Hi.

01:17:55.292 --> 01:17:57.167
Jesus, I was scared.

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:01.750
I'm so sorry.

01:18:09.792 --> 01:18:11.542
What did they do to you?

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:27.125
What is your ambition
for this technology, Ms Amari?

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:35.292
To give people a chance at
a life they might never know.

01:18:43.625 --> 01:18:44.708
Thank you.

01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:05.083
Partner.

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:12.000
Sorry about the nose.

01:19:12.083 --> 01:19:14.042
It's okay.

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:18.917
Maybe I pushed a little hard
on this virtual confinement thing.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.458
Yeah, about that.

01:19:21.458 --> 01:19:22.583
I'm gonna withdraw.

01:19:23.042 --> 01:19:24.042
What?

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:26.958
Wait, what are you saying?

01:19:27.042 --> 01:19:29.500
I will take my time, wrap up R and D.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.750
The company is yours,
but the patent stays with me.

01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:35.333
What fucking use is that?

01:19:35.417 --> 01:19:37.167
- Danny died.
- Yeah, but...

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:46.458
Look...

01:19:49.792 --> 01:19:51.333
What happened to you in there?

01:20:18.875 --> 01:20:21.292
<i>- Dr Amari.
- It's me.</i>

01:20:23.333 --> 01:20:26.042
<i> A colleague told me what Sam did.</i>

01:20:26.125 --> 01:20:28.208
<i>You get to say I told you so.</i>

01:20:28.292 --> 01:20:30.000
<i>So long as you're okay.</i>

01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:32.833
<i>- I'm fine. It's over.
- Good.</i>

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.083
<i>Confinement... Unbelievable.</i>

01:20:35.167 --> 01:20:38.375
<i>Dad, let's go to the hospital.</i>

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.667
<i>- Are you sure?
- I am.</i>

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.208
<i>I'll make the arrangements.</i>

01:20:47.708 --> 01:20:49.333
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:21:04.792 --> 01:21:06.792
- Sam.
<i>-  You need to see something.</i>

01:21:06.875 --> 01:21:09.667
- I told you...
- Five minutes? In person.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:48.875
Good luck.

01:21:53.417 --> 01:21:54.250
Here she is.

01:21:54.333 --> 01:21:56.458
Hey. Come. Come here, come here.

01:21:56.542 --> 01:21:57.833
How you doing?

01:21:58.583 --> 01:22:00.375
Come in, sit down...

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.708
and take a look at something.

01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:07.208
Hey.

01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:10.667
To our resident genius.

01:22:13.792 --> 01:22:15.000
Oh, not me.

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:16.875
You, dumbass.

01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:20.167
Okay, what's going on?

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:21.917
You feeling good?

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.375
Let's talk about that.

01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:25.708
Look at the limbic.

01:22:30.417 --> 01:22:33.000
- I was scared.
- Yeah. Here, you're scared.

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:37.875
Here, you like it.

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:41.667
Tell me what was so good
about being in that cell.

01:22:46.625 --> 01:22:49.125
- I knew it.
- She fucking broke out!

01:22:49.208 --> 01:22:51.667
Screw the prison,
make me a drug that gives people

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:52.667
fully interactive experiences.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:54.292
No, no, no. We have done this.

01:22:54.375 --> 01:22:57.292
- What?
- It doesn't matter.

01:22:57.375 --> 01:23:00.875
This is a major breakthrough.
This is gonna save our company.

01:23:00.958 --> 01:23:02.726
There's enough data
to reverse-engineer the code.

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:03.875
- Right?
- It's rough.

01:23:03.958 --> 01:23:06.667
Another trial with a conscious
interaction would be useful...

01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:08.833
Okay, whatever. A few tweaks, of course.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.458
Ba-da-bing! You two do
that thing you do so well...

01:23:11.542 --> 01:23:12.708
I'm not going back.

01:23:12.792 --> 01:23:15.184
- You're the only one who can.
- It's not going to be anyone.

01:23:15.208 --> 01:23:17.000
You fucking owe me!

01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:28.167
Just remember when we started this.

01:23:28.708 --> 01:23:30.000
Yeah?

01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:31.750
I was working in app development.

01:23:31.833 --> 01:23:33.393
You were writing that thesis
no one could understand.

01:23:33.417 --> 01:23:35.500
And now, look at us.

01:23:37.083 --> 01:23:38.917
We're about to change the world.

01:23:43.292 --> 01:23:44.667
I'm sorry.

01:23:46.958 --> 01:23:49.000
No, no, no. Just, just...

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.208
Will you sit?

01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:55.375
Please? Please.

01:24:18.542 --> 01:24:20.583
"Broadening minds."

01:24:23.833 --> 01:24:25.500
That's what you said to me.

01:24:28.417 --> 01:24:29.977
That's what we're supposed to be doing.

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:36.000
If you'd share this discovery,
we can make that possible.

01:24:36.083 --> 01:24:38.208
But if I can't change your mind,

01:24:38.292 --> 01:24:40.083
then what about this?

01:24:44.042 --> 01:24:45.143
- What the fuck?
- Did I get her?

01:24:45.167 --> 01:24:46.583
You son of a bitch!

01:24:46.667 --> 01:24:49.250
Shh. It's just a minute.
Relax, relax, relax.

01:24:49.333 --> 01:24:51.542
It's okay.

01:24:51.625 --> 01:24:52.625
It's just a minute.

01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:56.958
Hook it up.

01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:00.542
Byron, you wanna be rich? Do it!

01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:02.458
No.

01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:12.292
The sooner we get the fucking data,

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:13.575
the sooner we can get her out.

01:25:16.458 --> 01:25:18.000
Are we good?

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:21.375
Are we good?

01:25:22.167 --> 01:25:23.167
It's online.

01:25:23.250 --> 01:25:25.583
It's working? It's online?

01:25:25.667 --> 01:25:26.792
Yes.

01:25:27.042 --> 01:25:30.083
No!

01:25:46.042 --> 01:25:48.292
It's just code. It's just code.

01:25:50.917 --> 01:25:53.833
You've done this before,
you can do it again.

01:25:59.792 --> 01:26:01.667
You've done this before,

01:26:02.833 --> 01:26:04.583
you can do it again.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.458
Wait, wait. What was that?

01:26:32.042 --> 01:26:34.292
- What's that? That. What is it?
- Shut up! I don't know.

01:26:34.375 --> 01:26:36.458
- Fix it, Byron.
- Fucking wait!

01:27:02.375 --> 01:27:04.167
Get his feet.

01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:06.583
Grab his fucking feet!

01:27:24.583 --> 01:27:25.917
That's six months.

01:27:29.417 --> 01:27:31.417
- Ren.
- Do you think he'll break out?

01:27:39.167 --> 01:27:40.917
What are we waiting for?

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.125
Hmm?

01:27:45.417 --> 01:27:47.667
Ren! What are we waiting for?

01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:49.167
How long is it?

01:27:58.083 --> 01:28:00.125
Ren, bring him back now.

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:02.667
- He's going to die.
- Induce arrhythmia.

01:28:05.583 --> 01:28:07.958
Someone call an ambulance. Now!

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:24.500
Ren!
