WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:03.704
I <i>love...</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:09.543
our married people plates
so much. Don't you?

00:10.911 --> 00:14.315
They have a pleasant heft
and no rough surfaces.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.816
No. Hmm.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.318
You finished?

00:22.190 --> 00:24.024
We should have a dinner party.

00:24.158 --> 00:28.162
We have six smooth, beautiful
married people plates.

00:28.296 --> 00:31.199
We can invite Frank and Morgan.

00:31.332 --> 00:35.002
That sounds <i>not</i> fun
and like we might have
fewer plates by the end.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.838
What about Jordan and Asher?
That could be fun.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.608
But if we invite Asher
and not Jerome,
is that offensive?

00:41.275 --> 00:44.178
Okay, best idea yet,

00:44.312 --> 00:47.181
skip the dinner party,
skip the awkwardness,
see our friends at work.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.816
I'll be ready in a minute.

00:48.949 --> 00:51.785
It will be closer
to four minutes, possibly five.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.254
Both are acceptable.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.568
<i>I need
the M&M report on my surgery.</i>

01:07.701 --> 01:09.870
And by your surgery, you mean?

01:10.003 --> 01:12.840
The one Shaun performed on me.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.675
The committee found no evidence
that Shaun did anything wrong.

01:14.808 --> 01:15.809
Inconclusive.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.978
They decided the evidence
was inconclusive.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.513
I would like to do
my own review.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.917
Do you really think
you can be impartial,

01:24.051 --> 01:26.920
or will you just be searching
for a reason to punish Shaun?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.591
I don't know why I would,

01:30.724 --> 01:33.694
unless something
in the report suggests
Dr. Murphy made a mistake.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.266
I'll email you the file.

01:45.673 --> 01:46.940
How are you?

01:47.074 --> 01:48.342
I'm fine.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.944
Mm. So brave,
pretending not to be hurt

01:51.078 --> 01:52.913
after your crush shot you down!

01:53.046 --> 01:54.715
I asked Perez to drinks
to be nice

01:54.848 --> 01:55.916
because I was mean
to him all day.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.551
- I do not have a crush.
- Yeah, whatever.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.575
Sorry. Forgot these.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.147
That was extraordinary.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.148
I feel nothing.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.021
Help me!

02:34.154 --> 02:36.490
Cady Stinson, 24,
history of bipolar
and depressive disorder.

02:36.624 --> 02:39.126
Came in with cuts,
abrasions, and likely
right distal radial fracture.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.794
She jumped out of our car
while it was moving.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.162
They're kidnapping me!

02:42.296 --> 02:43.864
Have five milligrams
of haloperidol ready, in case.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.166
Cady, you're safe.
I'm Dr. Park.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.102
I'm here to help.
I need to examine
your wrist, okay?

02:51.472 --> 02:53.807
We were on our way
to an inpatient psych facility.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.943
She's so worked up
because she doesn't want to go.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.678
She hasn't even recognized us
in at least two months.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.213
No, no, no. Don't talk to them!

02:59.347 --> 03:00.881
- They're liars!
- Cady, Cady, Cady,
please hold still.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.016
You-- You can't trust them.
Please, please, Dr. Park.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.652
- No! No! Get that away from me!
- Cady, Cady, Cady.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.786
- Careful with the arm.
- No! No, no!

03:05.919 --> 03:07.187
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

03:07.321 --> 03:10.391
- Aah!
- Aah! Aah!

03:11.959 --> 03:13.227
Radial artery's lacerated.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.728
We need to get her to an OR.

03:31.245 --> 03:35.015
This is Dr. Shaun Murphy,
one of our surgical attendings.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.284
This is Julianne.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.918
She fractured her ankle
falling off a curb.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.220
The tibiotalar joint
may be an issue.

03:40.354 --> 03:43.056
I got dizzy from hypoglycemia.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.825
Must've mistimed my insulin.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.827
No idea how that happened.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.329
Is it time to check
my blood sugar?

03:48.462 --> 03:49.430
No, not yet.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.468
Oh, that is a very shiny
wedding ring.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.837
How long has it been,
Dr. Murphy?

03:56.970 --> 03:59.407
Lea and I have been married
for three months

03:59.540 --> 04:01.409
and seven days and 13 hours.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.277
Wet cement year. Oh.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.013
I wish I met more
of my clients at that stage.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.082
I'm a marital therapist.

04:09.216 --> 04:10.751
And best-selling author,

04:10.884 --> 04:12.185
host of one of my
favorite podcasts,

04:12.320 --> 04:13.554
and probably the reason
why Jay-Z

04:13.687 --> 04:14.888
and Beyonce are still together.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.256
Full plantar and dorsiflexion

04:16.390 --> 04:17.525
range of motion.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.060
The first year of marriage
is crucial

04:20.193 --> 04:22.796
for cultivating good patterns
and weeding out bad ones

04:22.930 --> 04:25.733
before they can harden
into habits

04:25.866 --> 04:27.701
that will define
your entire relationship.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.104
What habits define
<i>your</i> marriage?

04:32.205 --> 04:34.408
I'm afraid all our habits
are in the past.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.943
My husband died recently.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.647
I'm so sorry for your loss.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.748
How long has he been gone?

04:41.515 --> 04:42.716
A little over five months.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.720
Is it time to check
my blood sugar?

04:46.854 --> 04:47.721
You asked her
about a minute ago.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.860
- It was longer than that.
- No, it wasn't.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.595
And I know, from your podcast,

04:54.728 --> 04:56.930
your husband died
several years ago.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.301
You need surgery on your ankle,

05:02.436 --> 05:04.104
but we should MRI your brain.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.880
We've repaired the laceration
to her radial artery,

05:13.013 --> 05:14.515
but there's still
a decision to be made

05:14.648 --> 05:15.749
on treating her wrist fracture.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.588
There's a choice between
external or internal fixation.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.923
The external fixator involves
attaching a metal frame

05:23.056 --> 05:24.825
to her forearm and hand.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.760
It requires a longer stay

05:26.894 --> 05:29.530
and frequent adjustments
for eight to twelve weeks.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.700
Internal gets Cady
out of the hospital sooner,

05:32.833 --> 05:34.602
but has a high risk
of complications,

05:34.735 --> 05:35.769
like nerve damage or infection.

05:37.137 --> 05:40.240
Uh, I don't like the sound
of those complications.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.776
The treatment center will only
hold her spot for a week.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.112
What happens if they can't
handle those adjustments?

05:45.245 --> 05:46.780
I can reach out to them.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.617
I-I-I'm not certain
about sending Cady

05:49.750 --> 05:51.685
away for treatment
at this point.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.455
She nearly killed herself
rather than go to that place.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.658
She's a danger to herself.
She's a danger to others.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.861
She needs more help
than we can give her.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.897
We'll leave you two
alone to talk.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.700
As Cady's mother,
it's my decision.

06:08.001 --> 06:08.802
Moira!

06:09.903 --> 06:11.038
I love Cady like a daughter.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.810
But if she comes home...

06:21.214 --> 06:22.282
I'm not sure I can.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.465
Please do the external fixator.

06:39.366 --> 06:40.233
Thank you, doctors.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.574
I gave Lim a copy
of the M&M report today.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.041
She was very insistent.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.242
She come see you?

06:49.376 --> 06:50.043
Not yet.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.047
- Uh, I'll clear out.
- Please stay.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.183
I am interested
in your opinion, as well.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.384
Must be a real doozy of a case

06:57.518 --> 06:59.753
if you called all of us,
the chief included.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.354
I am treating
a 51-year-old woman

07:01.489 --> 07:03.791
with a fractured ankle
and a distorted sense of time.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.293
It is too soon to tell
if it is a doozy.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.828
Now, we can begin.

07:07.961 --> 07:11.431
Please describe
all of the bad habits
that developed

07:11.565 --> 07:14.568
during the first year
of your respective
failed marriages.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.570
Or good habits, if you had any.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.742
So, we're all here because...

07:21.875 --> 07:23.376
As an attending,

07:23.511 --> 07:24.545
I no longer have time to talk

07:24.678 --> 07:25.579
to you all individually,

07:25.713 --> 07:27.380
so, I called a meeting

07:28.516 --> 07:29.883
of the divorced.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.786
Dr. Glassman, you have
the most failed marriages.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.890
Park's split-up
was much more recent.
You go first.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.027
Well, that was a break-up,

07:40.160 --> 07:41.261
not a divorce.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.063
You and Dr. Reznick
seemed pretty serious.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.135
Um, don't get involved

07:48.268 --> 07:50.303
with a pathologically ambitious
narcissist and, uh...

07:52.105 --> 07:54.742
be as emotionally open
as possible,

07:54.875 --> 07:56.243
which you're already great at.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.678
And that goes for everything.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.146
Nothing is too small
to discuss.

07:59.279 --> 08:03.150
Except for the infinite number
of differences of opinion.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.919
And how do you know
which ones don't matter?

08:10.758 --> 08:12.593
Dr. Murphy,
if you have concerns
about your marriage,

08:12.726 --> 08:13.827
talk to your wife.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.196
Meeting adjourned.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.535
Julianne's brain MRI.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.003
Check out the parietal lobe.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.104
Dr. Andrews!

08:31.745 --> 08:34.147
You have a grade 2 oligodendroglioma

08:34.214 --> 08:35.583
centered in your parietal lobe.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.718
It's disturbing
your precuneus region.

08:39.086 --> 08:39.953
May I?

08:42.255 --> 08:44.958
Looked at a lot of brains
during my doctoral
psych program.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.030
It's close to the motor
and primary sensory cortex.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.532
We will need to map out

08:52.666 --> 08:53.967
the critical structures
of your brain

08:54.101 --> 08:55.302
to determine
a surgical approach.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.336
There are risks,

08:56.469 --> 08:57.771
but if we can get all of it,

08:57.905 --> 08:59.973
the prognosis is excellent.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.474
Or we could
try to shrink the tumor

09:01.609 --> 09:02.542
with chemo and radiation,

09:02.676 --> 09:04.111
but there's an increased chance

09:04.244 --> 09:07.380
the tumor will progress
to a grade 4 glioma.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.986
I want the surgery.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.390
My life's work has been
to help people find

09:17.524 --> 09:18.792
what my husband and I had.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.362
I'm not done yet.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.498
That is... very good to hear.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.336
This transcranial
magnetic stimulation

09:29.469 --> 09:31.338
will pinpoint the pathways
of your motor cortex

09:31.471 --> 09:33.106
and help us resect
your brain tumor.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.441
And this is my wife, Lea.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.745
- Hey.
- Lea, met Julianne.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.112
She is a marriage therapist

09:39.246 --> 09:41.014
and told me to be careful
of the habits we set.

09:42.515 --> 09:45.953
Great to meet you,
but under the circumstances--

09:46.086 --> 09:47.721
Chatting with you two
is much better

09:47.855 --> 09:50.423
than contemplating those circumstances.

09:50.557 --> 09:51.892
Stay.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.560
I made a list of small habits

09:53.694 --> 09:55.095
that could become
larger problems.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.703
"Snoring, minor tardiness."

10:04.537 --> 10:06.539
- Is that supposed to happen?
- Yes.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.909
A disconcerting tolerance
for dust.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.044
- These are all my habits.
- Yes.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.080
Do I have habits
you would like <i>me</i> to change?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.819
At this point,
you better just say it, hmm?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.388
The dishes.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.790
You take them
out of the dishwasher

10:22.923 --> 10:24.557
and rerinse them
after I've already done it.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.459
Because you are doing it wrong.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.965
Try to hold still.

10:32.099 --> 10:35.235
We just need to make sure
that your wound's clean
for surgery tomorrow.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.104
My head hurts.
I-I need to sit up.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.072
Hey.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.077
Please, just let me see my mom.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.316
She wouldn't like
what you're doing to me.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.322
We're all trying
to help you feel better.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.858
You hungry?

10:57.991 --> 10:59.492
Paul went to get you some food.

11:01.962 --> 11:02.996
I want to go home.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.464
Okay, wound looks good.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.000
Now, let's pack it with gauze.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.635
We can give her something
to try to help her relax.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.337
No. No more poison.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.505
She doesn't need
to be drugged.
She's uncomfortable.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.108
Please, just let her out.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.112
I can't. I'm sorry.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.157
On all three fundamentals,

11:30.290 --> 11:32.926
water temperature,
choice of equipment,
and application of force,

11:33.060 --> 11:34.094
your technique is lacking.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.462
Shaun, we have a dishwasher.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.330
This is just
a preliminary rinse.

11:37.464 --> 11:41.301
Shaun, um, instead
of offering a critique,

11:41.434 --> 11:44.504
try stating a positive need.

11:44.637 --> 11:49.376
You know, something like,
"I wish the situation
was more like this..."

11:51.644 --> 11:55.115
I wish the situation
was more like

11:55.248 --> 11:56.784
Lea knew how
to wash the dishes.

11:56.917 --> 11:57.985
We're done with the mapping.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.057
Lea, do you enjoy
doing the dishes?

12:04.191 --> 12:05.492
Does anyone?

12:05.625 --> 12:06.426
I do.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.833
Then forget finding
common ground on this, huh?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.167
Divide and conquer.

12:19.206 --> 12:24.444
He went three for four,
two doubles, three RBIs,
and struck out the side!

12:26.213 --> 12:28.748
Well, wait until he's 16
and can throw a curve.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.751
Oh, I-I think I can
get back from here.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.753
Oh, please.
I'm enjoying the company.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.088
Ohh!

12:35.222 --> 12:38.191
You're so sweet.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.761
- I feel nothing.
Leave me alone.
- Fine.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.700
What have you two been
fighting about?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.036
- Everything.
- Just little stuff.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.703
Yeah, because you're so crabby.

12:50.838 --> 12:51.671
Because you're so distracted.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.376
It's always like this
when I'm on night shifts.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.911
Why do you think night shifts
are a problem?

13:00.380 --> 13:03.150
We have less time together
to hang out and--

13:03.283 --> 13:05.618
Sex! There's no sex.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.220
Because he's too tired
when he gets home.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.223
Hmm.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.693
Why do you have to wait
until he gets home?

13:18.265 --> 13:20.000
Five more on this side,
then switch.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.101
I'm going to get a heat pad.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.806
You wanted to do
a hemihepatectomy,

13:26.940 --> 13:28.275
but Shaun changed
your surgical plan.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.277
Is that right?

13:32.412 --> 13:35.748
Would you like me
to put my hand
on a Bible, counselor?

13:35.883 --> 13:38.385
I thought removing a lobe
was the safest choice.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.753
After I left,
the parameters changed.
Shaun adjusted.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.791
A resident overruled
your judgment,

13:44.925 --> 13:47.060
<i>without</i> bothering
to consult you,

13:47.194 --> 13:48.595
and you were fine with that?

13:48.728 --> 13:50.864
That resident was days away
from becoming an attending,

13:50.998 --> 13:53.300
and he did exactly
what you trained him to do:

13:53.433 --> 13:55.535
he made a tough decision,
a hard call,

13:55.668 --> 13:56.703
with limited data.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.172
Would you have made that call?

14:01.374 --> 14:04.211
When I got back,
I evaluated the progress,

14:04.344 --> 14:06.479
and I decided
that it was safe to continue.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.316
It was safe?

14:10.317 --> 14:12.385
Or you had no choice?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.154
Clearly, you read the report.
You tell me.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.727
You asked why
no one had come to get you.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.762
If you were fine
with Shaun's call,
why would you care?

14:23.496 --> 14:24.597
I was worried about you.

14:24.731 --> 14:25.665
Thank you.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.304
But if you were fine
with the call,
why would you care?

14:33.907 --> 14:36.043
- I got angry.
- You didn't say angry
in the M&M.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.211
You said, "Concerned."

14:38.345 --> 14:40.180
You're slicing the salami
pretty thin right now.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.681
Why not just say
you were angry?

14:41.814 --> 14:44.817
My precise emotional state
is not medically relevant.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.987
Unless you were angry
because Shaun made a bad call.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.161
Shaun saved your life.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.055
What?

15:23.323 --> 15:25.092
Folding the shirt in thirds

15:25.225 --> 15:27.227
allows them
to be stored vertically.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.062
Sure, but I'd rather--

15:29.196 --> 15:31.098
Storing them vertically
saves space

15:31.231 --> 15:33.000
and makes them easier to find.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.737
Well, why don't you
fold the shirts?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.374
That is an excellent idea.

15:45.912 --> 15:46.779
Good night.

15:47.714 --> 15:48.548
Good night.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.864
Not a bad way
to spend a dinner break.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.670
I'm going to go crash
for a while
before my call starts.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.604
Okay.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.409
Hey, we need Dr. Park
or security.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.345
- What's wrong?
- I-I went home to get
a change of clothes--

16:18.478 --> 16:19.779
I must've
fallen asleep.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.149
She's gone.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.425
Cady couldn't sleep with,
with the restraints.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.127
She was upset
and uncomfortable.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.063
I took them off.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.133
I asked her to. It's my fault.

16:41.568 --> 16:45.038
It's not your job
to enforce hospital protocol.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.074
Security's been alerted.
They're working top-down.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.975
You guys cover the east wing.
We'll take the west.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.244
Start down that hall.
I'll check the patient rooms.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.050
Resecting the final
aspect of the tumor.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.521
Lea and I
took Julianne's advice

17:01.654 --> 17:03.123
and divided and conquered
last night.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.426
I started with the dishes
and then moved on
to folding laundry.

17:06.559 --> 17:07.460
More irrigation.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.064
And Lea,
what did she conquer?

17:11.198 --> 17:15.635
I was very open and pointed out
her shirt-folding errors,
and then she went to bed.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.337
It was quite successful.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.040
You sure about that?

17:22.775 --> 17:25.645
- Did she...
kiss you good night?
- Yes.

17:26.513 --> 17:28.047
- Cheek or lips?
- Cheek.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.484
I got all of the tumor.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.720
Remove the patties
and line the resection bed
with Fibrillar.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.691
You think maybe
it was not a success with Lea?

17:40.927 --> 17:42.829
- Sounds like maybe--
- You bombed.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.566
She's in V-tach.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.670
No carotid pulse.
No detectable BP
on the art line.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.071
Check the brain
for herniation or hematoma.

17:53.373 --> 17:57.410
No bleeding
or signs of edema...

17:57.544 --> 18:00.380
No increased ICP.
Maybe she threw a PE?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.915
Her EKG was normal.
Give one milligram of epi
and stand by with more.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.986
Clear!

18:15.562 --> 18:19.399
Her brain looked good.
Her vitals were stable.

18:19.532 --> 18:20.833
No history
of heart disease.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.702
Could be an adverse reaction
to the anesthesia?

18:24.704 --> 18:28.541
Do an echo, send trops,
and put her on telemetry
to rule out cardiac issues.

Cady.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.577
Hey.

19:05.778 --> 19:06.579
Okay?

19:11.918 --> 19:13.586
Seems like you're feeling
a bit better.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.356
I'm working on my solo.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.024
I know. I heard.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.159
It's lovely.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.063
Would you sing it to me
while we walk back
to your room?

19:26.633 --> 19:28.000
Do I have to lie down?

19:28.134 --> 19:29.402
It makes my head hurt.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.505
You can sit up in your bed.

19:34.807 --> 19:35.975
Okay. Come on.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.747
Attagirl.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.823
Cady, do your feet hurt?

19:50.957 --> 19:53.159
No. They're just sticky.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.661
They put glue on them
to keep me from running.

19:56.796 --> 20:00.166
<i>♪ But I see your true colors
Shining through... ♪</i>

20:00.300 --> 20:02.001
- We need to get a head CT.
- Yeah.

20:02.134 --> 20:02.869
<i>♪ I see your true ♪</i>

20:03.736 --> 20:05.638
The ventricular enlargement,

20:05.772 --> 20:07.640
that's fluid built up
inside her brain.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.643
Cady has hydrocephalus.

20:10.777 --> 20:13.012
It explains a lot
of her symptoms,
shuffling her feet,

20:13.145 --> 20:15.648
the headaches
when she lies down, and...

20:17.717 --> 20:20.052
possibly,
her psychiatric issues.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.157
Cady might not be bipolar?

20:25.292 --> 20:26.859
We'll know more
once we insert a shunt

20:26.993 --> 20:28.728
and drain the fluid
from her brain.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.797
I noticed the shuffling
a year ago.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.899
I-I didn't even mention it
to the doctor.

20:33.032 --> 20:36.102
I just thought it was
another... delusion.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.738
All the doctors
we brought her to,
they all missed it.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.009
We almost locked her up.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.076
She could've died in there.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.586
We removed all of the tumor.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.422
The surgery
was successful, although--

20:55.555 --> 20:56.523
I died.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.392
I saw you.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.694
It was like
I was out of my body.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.697
I saw you doing compressions

21:04.831 --> 21:07.033
and there were
alarms going off.

21:07.166 --> 21:11.237
And then I saw my husband
in these quick flashes.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.906
He was waiting for me, somewhere.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.676
Tell me what you saw.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.812
There were vivid colors everywhere.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.549
It was unlike
anything I had ever seen.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.718
But it felt like home.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.020
What kind of colors?

21:28.788 --> 21:31.090
I... can't describe them.

21:31.223 --> 21:34.561
My husband
was reaching out to me...

21:36.195 --> 21:37.764
and I almost touched him.

21:39.432 --> 21:40.733
Then you pulled me back.

21:42.735 --> 21:43.970
You had a near-death
experience.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.707
Ah.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.276
No. She had a symptom.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.445
There is something else
wrong with your brain.

21:52.579 --> 21:53.613
We need to find out what it is.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.959
She didn't have
an out-of-body experience!

22:08.227 --> 22:10.363
She accurately described us
trying to save her.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.865
No, she described a code,
which only proves

22:12.999 --> 22:15.334
that she watches
medical shows on television.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.804
And the heaven
that she told us about,
it's all recycled cliches--

22:17.937 --> 22:21.307
the peace, nice colors,
your loved ones waiting.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.042
And maybe those cliches exist

22:23.175 --> 22:24.677
because that's what
the afterlife is like.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.347
- You're a believer.
- Please be quiet!

22:30.883 --> 22:33.119
Julianne must have
a multifocal tumor,

22:33.252 --> 22:35.187
most likely
in her occipital lobe.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.624
A tumor there
could've caused a subclinical,
nonconvulsive seizure,

22:37.757 --> 22:39.726
which would explain
her hallucination
and cardiac arrest.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.794
A tumor there would make sense.

22:42.629 --> 22:43.663
Then where is it?

22:45.432 --> 22:48.167
It must be hidden by the edema
from the previous tumor.

22:48.300 --> 22:51.003
We need more images
at a higher resolution.

22:51.137 --> 22:53.039
All right, I'll book the MRI
and get Julianne.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.810
Oh, are you
a one almighty God type

22:57.944 --> 22:59.679
or more spiritual,
but not religious?

23:00.847 --> 23:01.814
I'm just asking for a friend.

23:40.052 --> 23:40.853
You're off-target.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.692
Position the catheter
toward the nasion
and tragus skull landmarks.

23:48.828 --> 23:49.996
If Cady hadn't wandered off,

23:50.129 --> 23:52.098
we may have never noticed
the foot dragging.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.901
A good outcome doesn't
cancel out a bad decision.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.469
The chain of command
exists for a reason.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.242
I'm in.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.944
Attach the manometer
to check her brain pressure.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.584
Oh, no.
I'd guess about 40 centimeters.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.955
Must've been
building up for years.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.258
The brain damage
could be irreversible.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.530
I'm gonna
place the valve,

24:23.663 --> 24:25.064
start draining fluid
into the abdomen.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.972
I got your text.
Is everything okay?

24:39.011 --> 24:41.313
Were you mad last night
when I took over
folding the shirts?

24:43.883 --> 24:46.252
Shaun, at some point
we need to define

24:46.385 --> 24:49.021
what qualifies
as an important matter

24:49.155 --> 24:51.123
that needs to be discussed
as soon as possible.

24:51.257 --> 24:52.959
Yes. Okay. Were you mad?

24:54.393 --> 24:56.328
I was frustrated.
But I'm over it.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.164
Why were you frustrated?

24:58.297 --> 25:00.332
Didn't you want to know
the right way to do it?

25:00.466 --> 25:02.935
There's no right way
to do it, Shaun.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.106
There's my way,
there's your way,

25:07.239 --> 25:08.507
and a thousand other ways.

25:08.641 --> 25:10.777
And I don't need you to think
that my way is right.

25:10.910 --> 25:14.280
Especially since your way
is fully research supported.

25:14.413 --> 25:18.184
But knowing you think I'm wrong
about so many things,

25:18.317 --> 25:21.654
sometimes it feels like
you're watching me

25:21.788 --> 25:23.355
and holding a big sign
that says,

25:23.489 --> 25:24.791
"You're doing
everything wrong."

25:26.225 --> 25:27.359
That's why I was frustrated.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.463
And I know
you didn't mean it that way,

25:31.598 --> 25:32.732
and I know
it's important for you

25:32.865 --> 25:35.367
to have things a certain way.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.036
Because of my ASD.

25:37.169 --> 25:40.539
I love your brain, Shaun.

25:40.673 --> 25:44.143
And I really don't care
about laundry and dishes.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.749
I'll find something else
to be in charge of
like grocery shopping.

25:52.919 --> 25:57.189
Maybe you could check
the apples better for bruises.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.291
The store will not
take them back.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.028
Right.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.996
There's something wrong
with Julianne's brain.

26:04.797 --> 26:05.898
I don't see anything.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.001
Me neither.

26:12.504 --> 26:15.207
We'll know
a lot more about her prognosis
when she wakes up.

26:15.341 --> 26:18.177
For now, we're keeping her
under sedation

26:18.310 --> 26:20.212
and giving mannitol to keep
her brain pressure down.

26:20.346 --> 26:24.150
Well, whatever happens,
we'll get through it.

26:24.283 --> 26:25.918
You're in
for the long haul now?

26:27.353 --> 26:28.587
You threatened
to walk out on us.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.025
I was upset.

26:33.159 --> 26:37.029
I just-- I was trying to do
what was best for her
and for-- for you.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.230
By leaving us?

27:02.154 --> 27:05.291
Your symptoms point
to another tumor
in your occipital lobe.

27:06.258 --> 27:08.627
No tablet this time?

27:08.761 --> 27:13.299
The tumor
doesn't show up on imaging,
but I know it is there.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.635
We can see an irregular
and distinct pattern
of edema in that region.

27:16.769 --> 27:19.471
If the tumor's there,
it will very likely
stop your heart again.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.075
I've been dead before.

27:24.576 --> 27:25.144
It was pretty great.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.281
I don't want the surgery.

27:29.415 --> 27:34.020
No, the bright colors
you couldn't describe,
that's color agnosia.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.756
Your husband being
just out of reach,
that's optic ataxia.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.624
You did not see Heaven.

27:38.758 --> 27:41.093
You had a seizure
caused by your tumor.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.095
Dr. Murphy,

27:44.964 --> 27:47.099
you and I are both cursed

27:48.534 --> 27:51.003
with being very good
at fixing things.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.672
When Scott was alive,

27:53.806 --> 27:59.145
I could have made a list
of a hundred ways to improve
my marriage, my husband.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.680
But when I saw him again...

28:04.316 --> 28:07.186
I couldn't think
of a single thing I'd change.

28:09.956 --> 28:12.124
I just want to be
with my husband again.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.129
You will be.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.533
Uh, I think
what you experienced was real.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.373
What you saw, it's--
it's not going anywhere.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.708
And there are still
a lot of people here
who need your insight.

28:32.311 --> 28:36.682
I know that matters to you
because even with a tumor--

28:36.816 --> 28:38.150
Two brain tumors.

28:39.485 --> 28:42.054
Two brain tumors
and a broken ankle,

28:42.188 --> 28:44.156
you still made a point
of helping
half your medical team.

28:46.826 --> 28:47.960
Eternity is a long time.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.898
Your husband will
be waiting for you
whenever you get there.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.172
He better.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.845
Let's see if you're right.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.720
She's a GCS of eight,

29:14.854 --> 29:16.488
has most
of her brain stem reflexes.

29:16.622 --> 29:19.191
But no signs that she's ready
to come off the vent.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.463
She always took
forever to wake up.

29:31.503 --> 29:34.706
I saw Paul
in the cafeteria just now

29:34.841 --> 29:36.442
surrounded
by empty coffee cups.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.311
If you'd like some company--

29:39.445 --> 29:41.113
No, I'm fine.
Thank you, Doctor.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.831
I used to be a lieutenant
on an aircraft carrier.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.668
The first time
I saw a plane land,

30:02.801 --> 30:07.239
I thought for sure this sucker
is going to skid right off
the other end into the ocean.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.944
I promise there's a point
to this.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.182
But they never do.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.217
Because the planes,

30:18.350 --> 30:22.221
they have these tail hooks
that catch on these giant,
inch-thick steel wires.

30:22.354 --> 30:25.357
These wires, they can stop
a 50,000-pound aircraft

30:25.491 --> 30:29.328
traveling 150 miles per hour
in two seconds.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.298
And they almost never break...

30:34.766 --> 30:36.635
until they do.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.875
One swung across the deck
and hit my leg,
sent me flying.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.511
I was in a coma for weeks.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.181
My parents, they had to decide

30:49.315 --> 30:50.950
whether or not
to amputate my leg,

30:52.318 --> 30:53.352
and they disagreed.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.656
It got ugly.

31:01.293 --> 31:04.530
But my mom won.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.302
And I went to med school
on one leg.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.741
And my parents, they celebrated
45 years last month.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.115
When a family member is sick,

31:25.784 --> 31:26.885
everybody gets a pass.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.338
Hi, there.

31:51.043 --> 31:54.346
After Shaun committed
to the angioembolization,
my collateral vessels bled,

31:54.480 --> 31:56.482
causing my blood pressure
to bottom out.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.184
Audrey, it's late--

31:58.317 --> 32:01.120
That loss of BP
led to my cord ischemia,
which led to my paralysis.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.190
- Do you agree?
- Yes, as I said
in the report, yes.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.192
The report is facts.
It's just facts.

32:06.325 --> 32:08.727
Audrey, what exactly
do you want from me?

32:08.860 --> 32:11.330
I am sitting in this chair
because of that surgery.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.865
And everybody here
seems completely fine with it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.868
Fine with Shaun's decision,
fine with him going rogue.

32:17.003 --> 32:17.736
I'm not fine with it.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.209
- I'm not fine with it.
- Well, that is not
what you said in the M&M.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.377
What Shaun did was headstrong,
it was risky,

32:25.511 --> 32:27.079
and it's not
what I would have done, okay?

32:27.213 --> 32:28.747
But let's just be clear.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.149
He didn't make a mistake,

32:30.282 --> 32:31.583
he did
what he thought was best,

32:31.717 --> 32:34.153
and it shouldn't be a mark
on his career as a surgeon.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.655
- That is not your decision.
- And I'm angry, okay?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.725
I'm angry. So what?
It's irrelevant.

32:39.858 --> 32:43.395
I'm so angry I could scream.
It keeps me up every night.

32:43.529 --> 32:45.431
What if Andrews
didn't call me away?

32:45.564 --> 32:47.733
What if I had come back
just five minutes sooner?

32:47.866 --> 32:49.968
What if? What if? What if?

32:50.102 --> 32:52.404
Well, what would
you have done?

32:54.540 --> 32:55.741
Come on, Aaron.

32:55.874 --> 32:56.808
What would you have done?

32:58.944 --> 33:01.413
Would you have
told Shaun to go back
to the original plan?

33:08.087 --> 33:08.920
Yes.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.428
Thank you.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.434
Because everything's fixed now?

33:24.136 --> 33:25.671
Because you're gonna
walk again soon?

33:28.274 --> 33:29.441
Because you're with me.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.714
Finally somebody sees my side
instead of Shaun's.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.519
It's not either-or.

33:43.322 --> 33:44.656
I'm not so sure.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.872
There's just something sexy
about the closet.

34:02.441 --> 34:05.177
Maybe it's the symbolism.
You know, like coming out
of the closet.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.179
- I get it.
I just don't approve of it.
- Why?

34:08.414 --> 34:10.216
From the coffee shop
that's on my way in.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.285
Number two on your list
of top-ten food
and beverage items

34:13.419 --> 34:14.786
within walking distance
of the hospital.

34:15.587 --> 34:16.988
The almond croissant.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.660
Thanks. I'll pay you back.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.495
Don't you dare.
I'll see you in surgery.

34:24.296 --> 34:25.097
Oh.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.537
Okay, I feel something.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.640
A crush.

34:34.773 --> 34:38.244
A massive, all-consuming,
"my stomach rolls over
when I see him" crush

34:38.377 --> 34:40.011
because he is gorgeous

34:40.146 --> 34:43.382
and thoughtful and smart
and apparently eats carbs,
and I'm only human.

34:44.850 --> 34:46.385
- Happy now?
- Yeah.

34:48.554 --> 34:49.688
Are you gonna eat that?

34:53.225 --> 34:54.226
I'm so screwed.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.399
Just a minute. Dr. Murphy.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.441
Don't worry too much
about the wet cement.

35:11.243 --> 35:14.746
It's clear
how important your wife
and your marriage is to you.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.950
Just keep letting
Lea know that,

35:20.986 --> 35:23.289
and you'll keep being
a great husband.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.399
Count backwards from ten.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.134
Ten.

35:37.102 --> 35:37.936
Nine.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.207
Eight.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.775
BIS is at 50. CO2 is normal.
Ready, Doctor.

35:44.676 --> 35:47.746
Making the first incision.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.815
Stand by with the periosteal
for skull dissection.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.789
Heart rate's 125.
BP is 195 over 132.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.991
- Another seizure?
- It's the tumor.

36:00.125 --> 36:02.761
Give another 500 of Keppra
and high-dose propofol.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.465
She's in v-tach.
No pulse.

36:10.068 --> 36:10.669
One milligram of epi.

36:15.441 --> 36:16.242
Clear!

36:37.329 --> 36:38.397
It's been 12 minutes.

36:54.946 --> 36:58.650
Time of death, 12:43 p.m.

37:06.191 --> 37:08.727
They're together again, somewhere.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.033
Probably not.

37:18.203 --> 37:19.137
But that would be nice.

37:35.987 --> 37:36.688
Hey.

37:40.892 --> 37:42.060
Hey, sweetie.

37:42.961 --> 37:43.729
I'm here.

37:44.963 --> 37:47.866
Mom? What's going on?
Why am I here?

37:52.471 --> 37:53.505
You're in the hospital,

37:55.407 --> 37:56.908
but you're okay now.

Hey, Cady's latest neuro exam
showed no deficits.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.614
And the alignment
from her ex fix looks great.

40:20.318 --> 40:21.687
Um, I'm sorry.

40:24.556 --> 40:27.659
Chain of command
was never my strong suit.
I'm working on it.

40:27.793 --> 40:28.860
Thank you...

40:32.998 --> 40:34.232
for your service, Lieutenant.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.542
Was anybody
ever gonna ask about my limp?

40:47.746 --> 40:50.882
Shaun wanted to,
but we told him
he wasn't allowed.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.295
You lost a patient today,
Dr. Murphy?

41:04.429 --> 41:07.332
She seized on the table
before the first incision.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.601
Autopsy confirmed
she had a high-grade
occipital lobe tumor

41:09.735 --> 41:11.402
which would have killed her
in three to six months.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.773
Your advice was good.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.108
I talked to Lea about habits

41:17.242 --> 41:19.611
and learned
she doesn't appreciate
when I wash the dishes

41:19.745 --> 41:21.079
after she washes the dishes,

41:21.212 --> 41:22.714
even though
she is doing it wrong.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.315
Shaun, I can't hear this.

41:24.449 --> 41:26.818
Your advice was good.
I talked to Lea about--

41:26.952 --> 41:28.386
I mean,
I don't want to hear it.

41:32.591 --> 41:35.260
I'm having complicated feelings
about my surgery.

41:35.393 --> 41:36.928
- What you did.
- I saved your life.

41:40.431 --> 41:41.432
This--

41:42.568 --> 41:44.770
This is a struggle.

41:44.903 --> 41:48.940
You put me here,
and I'm really angry
about that.

41:52.744 --> 41:53.645
As your boss,

41:55.146 --> 41:57.015
I need to
set my feelings aside,

41:57.148 --> 41:58.750
be professional, and I will.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.155
But that's all.

42:04.289 --> 42:05.824
I don't want you to ask me
about my personal life,

42:06.992 --> 42:08.359
and I don't want
to hear about yours.

42:13.298 --> 42:15.200
From now on, our relationship
is medicine only.
