15:00.020 --> 15:02.560
[footsteps approaching]

15:02.760 --> 15:03.990
[gasps]

15:07.730 --> 15:09.000
What are you doing?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.040
Sorry. I, uh--

15:11.240 --> 15:12.300
That's my coat.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.480
- No, this is--
- [woman] What's going on?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.090
That girl's here,

15:17.290 --> 15:18.490
the one who killed
her brother.

15:18.690 --> 15:20.440
Please, I just...

15:22.220 --> 15:24.360
- Get the fuck out.
- I don't want any trouble.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.060
You can't have your house back.
Look. She has my coat.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.670
This is my
brother's jacket.

15:28.870 --> 15:30.020
[Paula]
Not anymore it's not.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.500
Put it down and
get the fuck out.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.630
I just
want our things.

15:33.830 --> 15:36.500
There's something
special that I...

15:36.700 --> 15:38.900
[Reggie] The rest of your stuff
is gone. We packed it up.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.150
We-- we gave it to
Kenny's mom for storage.

15:42.760 --> 15:46.380
There was this small ceramic
ornament about this big.

15:46.580 --> 15:47.340
Do you remember?

15:47.540 --> 15:49.000
He just fucking
told you no!

15:49.200 --> 15:52.170
Look. It was creepy
having your stuff here,

15:52.370 --> 15:54.350
and it's really creepy
that you're here right now,

15:54.550 --> 15:58.170
so please just put
the coat down and go away.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.220
- Please.
- Get the fuck out.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.450
Yeah. Okay.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.110
Yeah.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.410
Ah.

16:27.330 --> 16:29.030
Excuse me, bud.
[grunts]

16:35.550 --> 16:36.510
[door closes]

16:37.730 --> 16:39.250
You don't look good.

16:40.690 --> 16:41.600
Tom's dead.

16:42.690 --> 16:44.000
Bar's closed.

16:45.300 --> 16:47.310
- What are you doing?
- Oh, what do you care?

16:49.130 --> 16:50.400
I'm trying to figure
out the symbol

16:50.600 --> 16:53.280
that you refuse to
help me with,

16:53.480 --> 16:55.280
despite the fact that you
clearly know something

16:55.480 --> 16:58.140
- you're not telling me.
- Well, I'll tell you what I can.

17:00.100 --> 17:01.240
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.680
First, you have to
do something for me.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.500
Oh.

17:06.110 --> 17:08.160
So, now you need something
from me, you're--

17:08.360 --> 17:10.290
You know what?
First of all, fuck off,

17:10.490 --> 17:13.030
and second
of all, fuck off!

17:16.380 --> 17:17.420
Okay.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.040
Wait!

17:26.480 --> 17:27.790
What do you want?

17:27.990 --> 17:29.170
Mm.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.310
I want you to play.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.450
[door closes]

17:38.650 --> 17:40.630
The fuck is
wrong with you?

17:40.830 --> 17:44.580
If you play, I'll tell you
about the man in the photo.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.460
You tell me about the photo
first. Then I play.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.420
Mm, no.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.600
Just give me
the fuckin' violin.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.680
Not here.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.070
Come.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.340
The fuck?

18:03.600 --> 18:06.250
- Come with me!
- Okay! Alright!

18:07.340 --> 18:09.570
This took me all
fucking night.

18:09.770 --> 18:14.360
[voices chatting
indistinctly in distance]

18:14.560 --> 18:16.660
There's no way I'm letting
him anywhere near that--

18:16.860 --> 18:18.360
Tabby.

18:18.560 --> 18:21.100
How can you even
consider this, Jim?

18:21.790 --> 18:23.100
After Thomas...

18:26.450 --> 18:28.590
Because the doctors
all said

18:28.790 --> 18:31.680
that we should let him
lead sometimes,

18:31.880 --> 18:33.510
and they also said
that we have to let him

18:33.710 --> 18:35.680
work through things
in his own way

18:35.880 --> 18:38.690
and to be there to
support him when he asks.

18:38.890 --> 18:41.330
Anyways, I'll be there,
right there with him.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.260
- I'm coming with you.
- Tabby.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.310
Look. I don't give a shit
what the doctors said.

18:50.510 --> 18:52.090
We're living in
a fucking nightmare,

18:52.290 --> 18:53.610
and that bitch tried
to kill my kid.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.520
Please let me
do this.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.540
Mom?

19:01.740 --> 19:03.830
Hey... Hey.

19:04.490 --> 19:07.280
I remember what
you told me yesterday

19:07.480 --> 19:10.850
about this place,
how scary it is.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.110
Mm-hmm.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.200
When you're on
a quest,

19:14.400 --> 19:17.200
we have to face
the scary things.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.330
That's how you take
their power away.

19:23.980 --> 19:25.330
Yeah.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.310
Stay with
Daddy, okay?

19:36.510 --> 19:38.520
And do exactly
what he tells you.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.570
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:46.050 --> 19:48.800
What were you
fucking doing, Boyd?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.270
[sighs]

19:52.270 --> 19:53.890
By the rules of
this town,

19:54.090 --> 19:55.940
the rules
<i>you</i>created,

19:56.140 --> 19:57.550
that girl should
have gone in the Box

19:57.750 --> 19:58.810
the second
you found her.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.770
Listen. Father Khatri--

20:00.970 --> 20:01.940
Khatri's fucking dead.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.680
Don't you
lay this on him.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.600
You made your
own call here, Boyd.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.600
You told people you
were coming back with answers,

20:09.800 --> 20:11.910
and instead, you came back
with a psychopath

20:12.110 --> 20:14.350
who killed not one
but four people.

20:14.550 --> 20:16.440
And because she's special,
she doesn't have to go

20:16.640 --> 20:19.310
in the Box? Do you
hear what that sounds like?

20:19.510 --> 20:20.610
- She knew things!
- [sighs]

20:20.810 --> 20:22.270
Out in the forest,
she knew things

20:22.470 --> 20:24.270
she couldn't
possibly have known!

20:24.470 --> 20:26.360
Okay. Great.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.270
- So what?
- What do you mean, "So what?"

20:28.470 --> 20:30.800
I mean, we're still
fuckin' here.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.450
Voices or no voices,

20:32.650 --> 20:35.930
do you see a yellow brick
fuckin' road leading us home?

20:36.130 --> 20:37.410
Because I sure don't.

20:37.610 --> 20:40.500
I just see someone who may
have just betrayed

20:40.700 --> 20:43.200
the one thing this place
still has going for it.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.670
And what's that?

20:45.850 --> 20:48.460
Faith. In you.

20:51.330 --> 20:53.470
- You want the truth?
- I mean...

20:53.670 --> 20:58.250
I don't think this has anything
to do with going home.

20:59.510 --> 21:01.520
I think this
is about Abby.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.530
I think you
shot your wife,

21:05.730 --> 21:07.310
and every
morning since,

21:07.510 --> 21:10.400
you wake up wishing
you'd done more,

21:10.600 --> 21:12.840
that you'd
been there for her,

21:13.040 --> 21:15.230
helped her,

21:15.430 --> 21:16.490
fixed her.

21:18.490 --> 21:20.400
But Abby's dead, Boyd.

21:21.450 --> 21:23.540
And Sara's a killer.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.630
You gonna have my
back on this or not?

21:33.420 --> 21:34.770
Okay.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.340
What do
you want, Boyd?

21:37.540 --> 21:40.040
You want my approval?
Y-You want absolution?

21:40.240 --> 21:41.520
'Cause you're
not gonna get it here.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.560
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

21:44.430 --> 21:46.440
What did
Tian-Chen say?

21:46.640 --> 21:49.480
How does she feel
about Sara being back?

21:50.260 --> 21:52.830
- I haven't--
- Yeah. Well, maybe you should.

21:57.140 --> 22:02.400
[indistinct chatting
in distance]

22:15.070 --> 22:16.420
Sara?

22:22.640 --> 22:24.690
He has something
he wants to say to you.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.710
Everyone thought
you died.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.450
But you didn't.

22:48.880 --> 22:49.890
You lived.

22:51.540 --> 22:52.890
Out in the woods.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.370
Only monsters
live in the woods.

23:01.550 --> 23:03.420
I thought
we were friends.

23:04.990 --> 23:06.380
But we're not.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.900
You're a monster.

23:12.730 --> 23:14.650
And I'm not
afraid of you.

23:18.740 --> 23:19.780
Okay.

23:56.910 --> 23:59.660
- Where are we going?
- It's just a little further.

23:59.860 --> 24:01.840
Listen. You want me to play
something for you, I'll play,

24:02.040 --> 24:04.100
but I'm not gonna wander around
with you all day while you--

24:04.300 --> 24:05.480
It's strange.

24:06.790 --> 24:08.790
The trees,
they're changing.

24:10.620 --> 24:11.880
The fuck does
that mean?

24:24.550 --> 24:27.640
Oh. Well,
this is, uh...

24:41.040 --> 24:42.480
Did you do all this?

24:43.170 --> 24:44.610
After everyone...

24:46.000 --> 24:47.190
Once I was alone,

24:47.380 --> 24:49.540
I-- I didn't want to look
at the cars anymore,

24:49.740 --> 24:53.750
so I put them where I
couldn't see them.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.540
There's more
past the rocks,

24:57.740 --> 24:58.720
a lot more,

24:58.920 --> 25:00.670
but those
were already here.

25:02.320 --> 25:03.710
Come on.

25:05.150 --> 25:08.470
I'm sorry about
what happened yesterday.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.470
I don't like when
people touch my things,

25:10.670 --> 25:12.770
and when I
heard you play...

25:13.900 --> 25:17.910
Uh, sometimes,
I get angry,

25:18.110 --> 25:19.030
and I'm sorry.

25:22.340 --> 25:23.690
Okay.

25:30.260 --> 25:31.530
Here.

25:33.090 --> 25:35.230
- Here what?
- This is where you play.

25:35.430 --> 25:36.880
Oh, thank God. Here.

25:39.660 --> 25:41.750
What do you, uh--
What do you wanna hear?

25:43.280 --> 25:45.110
Play the one
about the star.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.540
The what?

25:48.630 --> 25:50.070
Twinkling star.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.120
This was
your mother's car.

26:05.650 --> 26:08.690
She used to play
it when I was afraid.

26:09.820 --> 26:13.050
And I'd sit up here,
just like this,

26:13.250 --> 26:14.740
and she'd play.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.540
At night,
when we hid,

26:17.740 --> 26:18.970
when I heard
the people screaming,

26:19.170 --> 26:22.840
she'd tell me to think
about the twinkling stars.

26:24.970 --> 26:28.580
And then... I wouldn't
be afraid anymore.

26:29.930 --> 26:31.110
Do you
know that song?

26:33.760 --> 26:37.590
Yeah. Uh... I know it.

26:45.730 --> 26:50.820
[plays "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star"]

27:07.750 --> 27:12.890
[Jade continues
to play]

27:19.760 --> 27:24.900
[Jade continues
to play]

27:31.780 --> 27:36.910
[Jade continues
to play]

27:37.780 --> 27:42.920
[Jade continues
to play]

27:51.970 --> 27:54.100
[Jade finishes song]

28:00.890 --> 28:03.080
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.200
I didn't mean to...

28:11.990 --> 28:13.860
I didn't think
anyone would be here.

28:15.210 --> 28:16.210
It's okay.

28:18.390 --> 28:19.820
Plenty of room.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.710
Were you on the bus?

28:42.240 --> 28:43.150
Yeah.

28:45.810 --> 28:46.980
I'm sorry.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.250
Have you been
here long?

29:00.260 --> 29:01.340
A couple months.

29:03.820 --> 29:05.740
Feels like
much longer.

29:08.130 --> 29:10.440
Do you live
here in town?

29:11.180 --> 29:14.450
I mean, obviously,
you-- you live in town.

29:14.650 --> 29:15.920
I just...

29:17.450 --> 29:20.880
I hadn't seen you
up at the Colony House.

29:22.150 --> 29:23.890
I would've
noticed you.

29:25.450 --> 29:27.760
I, um...

29:30.020 --> 29:32.040
I guess right now,
I live here.

29:32.230 --> 29:35.730
I figured a priest
would live here

29:35.930 --> 29:37.170
or something.

29:37.370 --> 29:38.380
There used to be.

29:40.860 --> 29:41.990
Oh.

29:47.260 --> 29:49.440
I go every Sunday with
my grandma.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.920
Uh, to church,
I mean.

29:53.130 --> 29:54.830
As long as
I can remember.

29:57.310 --> 30:00.060
Is that where you were going
when you were on the bus?

30:00.260 --> 30:02.200
To see
your grandmother?

30:02.400 --> 30:06.230
Yeah. She... uh...

30:10.060 --> 30:12.070
I go see her
every weekend.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.170
I was never
all that religious,

30:15.360 --> 30:19.210
but... it always made
her happy,

30:19.410 --> 30:21.390
you know, me going to
church with her,

30:21.590 --> 30:25.090
and afterwards, we'd spend
the afternoon sitting outside,

30:25.290 --> 30:28.430
making these little
crochet owls.

30:29.520 --> 30:30.820
Really?

30:32.040 --> 30:35.970
It was always
an owl.

30:36.170 --> 30:38.360
And she has
hundreds of 'em.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.920
Uh, she would give them
to every person that she met.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.450
And I-- I
would tell her,

30:43.650 --> 30:48.110
"Grandma, maybe we could try to
switch it up a little bit.

30:48.310 --> 30:51.850
Maybe try a dog or
a bunny or something."

30:52.670 --> 30:54.510
But she'd tell me,

30:54.710 --> 30:57.420
"Elgin, I like
what I like,

30:57.620 --> 30:59.370
and I like owls."

31:00.420 --> 31:02.330
So we made owls.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.350
You must think
I'm really cool.

31:08.550 --> 31:09.380
[chuckles]

31:13.340 --> 31:16.260
I was kind of a dork
when I was a kid.

31:17.570 --> 31:19.140
My brother and I,

31:19.340 --> 31:23.930
we used to collect these little
ceramic Christmas ornaments

31:24.130 --> 31:25.400
from the dollar store
in town.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.110
We'd save up
all our money.

31:28.310 --> 31:31.020
We'd go every chance we got,
like, all year round.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.020
We wouldn't even wait
for Christmas.

31:34.580 --> 31:37.030
And then we'd get home,
and we would paint them

31:37.230 --> 31:40.110
with all
these crazy colors.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.950
We had so many at
one point,

31:43.150 --> 31:45.040
we could've decorated
a hundred trees

31:45.240 --> 31:47.210
and still had
some left over.

31:47.410 --> 31:50.250
Nathan's always looked
a lot better than mine.

31:53.430 --> 31:55.130
I thought
they were all gone.

31:57.390 --> 31:58.390
Turns out...

32:01.180 --> 32:05.010
Nathan kept one with him
all these years.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.970
He said it reminded him of
a time when things were...

32:12.750 --> 32:15.100
Is he here now?

32:16.100 --> 32:17.280
Your brother?

32:20.370 --> 32:21.330
He was.

32:30.770 --> 32:32.080
What happened
to the ornament?

32:32.280 --> 32:36.650
It's here...
somewhere. I just...

32:36.850 --> 32:40.700
I think the person who has
it won't wanna give it back.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.230
Hey.

32:42.420 --> 32:45.480
You need some muscle,
I'm happy to talk to 'em.

32:48.790 --> 32:50.090
You're sweet.

32:52.230 --> 32:55.190
How come you don't stay up
at the Colony House?

32:55.390 --> 32:58.410
I mean, the people up there seem
friendly, for the most part.

32:59.580 --> 33:03.410
No reason to be hanging
around an old, musty church.

33:05.410 --> 33:08.290
It always seemed like
such a nice idea...

33:11.460 --> 33:13.120
that no matter what
you did...

33:14.510 --> 33:16.510
if you
were truly sorry...

33:18.210 --> 33:19.510
then God would
forgive you.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.040
Do you
think that's true?

33:24.080 --> 33:26.270
That part
always seemed

33:26.470 --> 33:29.610
a bit like wishful
thinking to me.

33:31.270 --> 33:35.400
Why? Did you do something
that needs forgiving?

33:39.750 --> 33:41.280
I killed my brother.

33:47.460 --> 33:48.630
But it was
an accident.

33:51.150 --> 33:52.290
Right?

33:53.850 --> 33:55.730
- I mean, you wouldn't--
- You'll find out everything

33:55.930 --> 33:57.200
soon enough.

34:00.770 --> 34:05.390
Uh... maybe
I should, uh...

34:06.430 --> 34:07.390
Uh...

34:10.430 --> 34:12.440
It was really nice to
meet you, Elgin.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.110
Yeah.

34:20.310 --> 34:22.060
It was nice, uh...

34:24.880 --> 34:26.280
nice meeting
you, too.

34:43.690 --> 34:44.640
How did it go?

34:45.770 --> 34:47.650
You okay?

34:47.850 --> 34:49.130
I'm not afraid
anymore.

34:49.330 --> 34:52.430
Oh, baby,
I'm so proud of you.

34:53.780 --> 34:56.490
[Julie]
Hey. Nice going.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.490
Can you come help me
peel some potatoes for dinner?

34:58.690 --> 34:59.840
I don't wanna peel
potatoes.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.100
Okay. Neither do I.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.500
- Go on.
- Let's go.

35:02.700 --> 35:03.570
Come on.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.160
How did he do?

35:11.360 --> 35:14.630
- He did great.
- Yeah? Oh, God.

35:16.980 --> 35:18.560
Life lessons
from the Cromenockle.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.460
[kisses] Who would
have thought?

35:45.530 --> 35:46.530
[gasps]

35:53.230 --> 35:54.360
I'm sorry.

35:56.540 --> 35:58.160
I shouldn't
have come here.

35:58.360 --> 35:59.730
[speaks Cantonese]

35:59.930 --> 36:01.150
Wait.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.210
You take from me.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.260
You take him from me.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.390
Yes.

36:21.870 --> 36:23.700
I take care of you.

36:25.870 --> 36:27.180
But you...

36:28.920 --> 36:32.580
you put hate
inside me.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.760
I know why you come.

36:39.890 --> 36:41.190
You wait.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.520
You take and go.

37:08.610 --> 37:10.750
You never come
here, this place.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.400
You never
come again.

37:16.750 --> 37:17.750
[bangs]

37:20.320 --> 37:23.850
[clatters]

37:24.050 --> 37:26.630
[Tian-Chen sobbing]

37:28.980 --> 37:32.550
[sobbing continues]

37:36.420 --> 37:38.520
- Are you kidding me?
- Kenny, I just--

37:38.720 --> 37:39.650
- Hey!
- Kenny, I--

37:39.850 --> 37:41.350
- What? What?
- I wasn't doing anything.

37:41.550 --> 37:42.830
You weren't doing
anything what? Give me that.

37:43.030 --> 37:44.660
- Kenny, please. Kenny, please!
- What the fuck is in it?

37:44.860 --> 37:46.880
Give me that. [grunts]
Your stuff? Huh?

37:47.080 --> 37:48.710
This is
your stuff, right?

37:48.900 --> 37:49.660
Is this Nathan's?

37:49.860 --> 37:50.970
What's that?
Give me that.

37:51.170 --> 37:53.840
- Stop. Stop! No! Please!
- Give me it. Give me it.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.230
What is this?

37:55.430 --> 37:56.410
- This important to you? Huh?
- Kenny.

37:56.610 --> 37:57.800
- This is meaningful?
- Kenny, please.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.500
- This mean a lot to you?
- Don't, please.

37:59.700 --> 38:01.620
- Fuck you!
- [onlookers] Oh.

38:04.450 --> 38:07.640
Hey. Hey.
Look. Listen.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.720
Look at me!

38:09.890 --> 38:14.380
I don't care what Boyd says,
and I don't give a shit

38:14.580 --> 38:16.040
how fucking special you
think you are.

38:16.240 --> 38:20.520
You ever come near my
mom again, and I swear to God

38:20.720 --> 38:23.560
I will drag your fucking psycho
ass into that Box myself.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.690
Do you
understand me?

38:27.600 --> 38:29.270
Do you understand?

38:29.470 --> 38:30.270
Yes.

38:30.470 --> 38:33.830
[crying]

38:35.530 --> 38:37.660
[onlookers murmur
indistinctly]

38:46.010 --> 38:47.720
[door opens]

38:47.920 --> 38:53.330
[onlookers murmur
indistinctly]

39:10.130 --> 39:11.350
Can I see?

39:11.550 --> 39:12.520
Hold on.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.870
Almost done.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.880
There we go.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.670
- Can I see?
- [chuckles]

39:23.870 --> 39:28.360
Keep in mind... I'm a
little out of practice.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.630
Ooh!

39:31.830 --> 39:33.580
- I think we did okay.
- [gasps]

39:39.980 --> 39:41.510
- I love it.
- Yeah?

39:41.710 --> 39:42.900
- [door opens]
- Come here.

39:44.990 --> 39:46.870
- I look like me again.
- [chuckles]

39:47.070 --> 39:47.950
[door closes]

39:50.030 --> 39:52.700
Oh, excuse me. Uh...

39:52.900 --> 39:54.130
Hi.

39:54.330 --> 39:57.490
Hi. I-- I was
looking for Kristi.

39:57.690 --> 39:59.790
Yeah. That's me. Hi.

39:59.990 --> 40:01.620
Sorry. I didn't
mean to interrupt.

40:01.820 --> 40:05.150
Oh, no. It's fine. [laughs]
How can I help you?

40:05.350 --> 40:07.530
Well, uh...
[unzips pack]

40:08.880 --> 40:11.010
...since you're
the resident Quincy...

40:15.500 --> 40:17.020
...I was hoping I
could give you this.

40:19.930 --> 40:22.500
Uh, why are you carrying around
liquid morphine?

40:28.600 --> 40:32.560
Mm. Um, when were
you diagnosed?

40:33.510 --> 40:35.570
About a month ago.

40:35.770 --> 40:37.660
I figure that by
the time I need that,

40:37.860 --> 40:41.830
I probably won't be
in any shape to...

40:42.030 --> 40:43.490
[sighs]

40:43.690 --> 40:44.840
I'll take care
of it, okay?

40:45.040 --> 40:46.440
Thank you.

40:47.270 --> 40:48.670
Look what I did.

40:48.870 --> 40:50.970
Ruined such a
nice afternoon.

40:51.170 --> 40:53.060
[laughs]

40:53.260 --> 40:55.070
I'll let you
get back to it.

40:55.260 --> 40:57.850
Oh, well, you're better
off in here, anyway.

40:58.050 --> 41:00.200
Oh, there's lots
of hubbub flying around

41:00.400 --> 41:02.800
now that that
Sara girl's back.

41:04.070 --> 41:05.460
I'm sorry. What?

41:07.330 --> 41:09.070
Kristi, where are
you going?

41:09.680 --> 41:11.780
- Baby, stop!
- No! I have to--

41:11.980 --> 41:13.040
- Stop!
- I have to go!

41:13.240 --> 41:15.520
Hey, just
talk to me!

41:15.720 --> 41:17.170
Hey! Talk to me!

41:17.370 --> 41:19.440
What is going on?

41:19.640 --> 41:21.870
You're not
going anywhere, okay?

41:22.070 --> 41:23.440
Not like this.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.920
Who is Sara?

41:25.120 --> 41:26.660
She killed somebody,

41:26.860 --> 41:29.050
and then she tried to kill
a little boy because I...

41:32.270 --> 41:34.060
We were talking one night.
She was at the clinic,

41:34.260 --> 41:37.800
and... and she asked me what I
would do to see you again.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.890
If it was something bad,
would it be worth it?

41:40.090 --> 41:40.940
And I said yes.

41:41.140 --> 41:42.200
I don't...

41:42.400 --> 41:43.550
I gave
her permission,

41:43.750 --> 41:45.800
and then the next day,
she-- Fuck.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.600
I just wanted to see
you again so badly that I--

41:50.800 --> 41:52.470
I wasn't even
listening to the question,

41:52.670 --> 41:53.910
and now, you're here,
and I'm wondering

41:54.110 --> 41:56.080
if that's my fault,
too. And I just...

41:56.280 --> 41:57.910
No. I just feel like all
I've been doing lately is

41:58.110 --> 42:00.860
- hurting people, and I just--
- No. Hey.

42:02.730 --> 42:04.960
This is
not your fault.

42:05.160 --> 42:07.220
I am here.

42:07.420 --> 42:08.570
Okay?

42:08.770 --> 42:09.870
We're together.

42:14.140 --> 42:15.140
Come inside.

42:18.010 --> 42:18.920
Come inside.

42:28.410 --> 42:30.540
His name
was Christopher.

42:31.370 --> 42:32.680
Christopher.

42:35.370 --> 42:36.690
Come with me.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.260
What?
No. Come on.

42:38.450 --> 42:39.870
It's right over here.

42:40.070 --> 42:40.940
[sighs]

42:49.260 --> 42:50.950
This was his car.

42:58.090 --> 43:01.280
He seemed nice at first,
'cause he made people laugh.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.970
That-- that wasn't an easy
thing to do back then.

43:05.360 --> 43:06.800
People liked him.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.020
And then?

43:14.020 --> 43:15.600
Then he changed.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.160
- Changed how?
- I-- I don't...

43:18.360 --> 43:20.250
I don't like this.
Uh, we should go back.

43:20.450 --> 43:22.990
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

43:24.470 --> 43:25.780
- But we had a deal.
- Mm.

43:25.980 --> 43:28.310
Right? I played your
song. I held up my end.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.650
You don't understand.

43:29.850 --> 43:31.310
You shouldn't be asking
these questions.

43:31.510 --> 43:32.610
Why? Why? Why?

43:32.810 --> 43:34.000
- Mm.
- Huh?

43:35.870 --> 43:38.840
Look. I haven't had
a good night's sleep

43:39.040 --> 43:41.670
since I fucking got here,
and I'm-- and I'm seeing things,

43:41.870 --> 43:43.760
things that are scaring
the shit out of me.

43:43.960 --> 43:47.110
And it's-- and it's all
because of this, right here!

43:47.310 --> 43:49.890
And whoever this Christopher
guy was, he saw it, too!

43:50.090 --> 43:51.020
He saw it.
He obsessed over it.

43:51.220 --> 43:52.810
He drew it a thousand
fucking times.

43:53.010 --> 43:55.680
So you playing your whole weird,
creepy mystery man routine,

43:55.880 --> 43:56.990
it's not exactly
helping me feel any better!

43:57.190 --> 43:58.680
When did he
start seeing the symbol?

43:58.880 --> 44:00.030
- I don't know.
- What does it mean?

44:00.230 --> 44:02.080
- I don't know!
- Well, what the fuck

44:02.280 --> 44:03.600
<i>do</i>you know?

44:03.800 --> 44:05.810
[moans quietly]

44:06.730 --> 44:07.810
[moans quietly]

44:26.830 --> 44:28.010
I'm sorry.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.660
I'm just...

44:34.060 --> 44:35.240
I know these
things are scary,

44:35.440 --> 44:38.940
and... I know that
these aren't things

44:39.140 --> 44:42.730
that you really
want to talk about, but...

44:42.930 --> 44:45.680
I am at
the end of my rope.

44:48.120 --> 44:49.070
Please.

44:53.290 --> 44:54.820
Everyone died.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.400
When Christopher started
seeing that symbol,

44:59.600 --> 45:02.140
things... changed.

45:02.340 --> 45:03.360
He changed,

45:03.560 --> 45:05.660
and he didn't make
people laugh anymore.

45:05.860 --> 45:08.220
He-- he stopped
smiling.

45:09.350 --> 45:11.890
One night, my mother told me
to hide somewhere new,

45:12.090 --> 45:14.150
somewhere different, somewhere
Christopher didn't know,

45:14.350 --> 45:16.930
and when I woke up
the next morning, everyone...

45:22.980 --> 45:24.060
[moans quietly]

45:25.370 --> 45:27.730
There are
bad things here.

45:27.930 --> 45:30.200
They make people
do bad things.

45:31.250 --> 45:32.250
I'm sorry.

45:59.100 --> 46:00.230
[Tabitha] I'm here!

46:07.890 --> 46:09.020
I'm here!

46:11.290 --> 46:12.290
I'm here!

46:23.080 --> 46:24.860
[child 1] Anghkooey!

46:26.300 --> 46:27.780

What?

48:08.360 --> 48:10.410
[Jim] Boyd.

48:10.610 --> 48:13.500
[sighs] Look. I don't wanna
do this right now, Jim.

48:13.700 --> 48:15.370
I'm not here to argue.

48:15.570 --> 48:19.020
I mean, I don't agree
with what you did, but...

48:20.240 --> 48:21.550
...but I looked
at that girl today,

48:21.750 --> 48:23.640
and I didn't see
a psychopath.

48:23.840 --> 48:24.990
I didn't see
a vicious killer.

48:25.190 --> 48:27.290
I saw a broken kid.

48:29.210 --> 48:31.160
And I'm looking
around, and...

48:31.990 --> 48:35.480
I'm seeing a lot of people
pushed to their edge.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.400
Okay.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.570
You ever wonder if
maybe that's the point?

48:40.770 --> 48:42.140
What are you
talking about?

48:42.340 --> 48:44.050
We heard a voice
on the radio.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.060
Yeah. Me and Donna,

48:47.260 --> 48:49.280
right as the storm
was coming in,

48:49.480 --> 48:51.500
and whoever it was,
he knew my name,

48:51.700 --> 48:53.330
knew what my wife was
doing in the house,

48:53.530 --> 48:56.230
in the basement
of our house.

48:57.450 --> 49:00.160
And I thought
maybe I was crazy.

49:00.360 --> 49:01.380
I think people
are watching us.

49:01.580 --> 49:04.340
- I think people are listening.
- Jim--

49:04.540 --> 49:06.300
[Jim] Now, there
are experiments like this

49:06.490 --> 49:09.080
going all the way
back to World War II.

49:09.280 --> 49:10.910
Look. We don't have to
trust each other.

49:11.110 --> 49:12.300
We don't even have to
like each other.

49:12.500 --> 49:14.380
But we've gotta start
working together on this.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.400
Now, I don't know what
they want from us,

49:19.590 --> 49:21.480
but if you can give me
a more rational explanation

49:21.680 --> 49:24.040
for what's going on here,
I'd love to hear it.

49:29.530 --> 49:30.570
I gotta go, Jim.
