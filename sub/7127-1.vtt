00:28.962 --> 00:31.089
Are you my guides?

00:32.365 --> 00:36.028
I'm Eli Stone. Eli Stone.

00:36.102 --> 00:39.162
I arranged a trek
through the Ranikhet Travel Agency.

00:39.239 --> 00:41.605
I'm going to the base
of the Panch Chuli peaks.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.575
That's a laptop so, you know,
you might want to...

00:44.644 --> 00:47.613
I'll carry this one myself,
thank you. I got it.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.886
Hey, it's me, Eli.
I've got a lot to say,

00:53.987 --> 00:57.548
but I'm underdressed for the altitude,
so I promise to be brief.

00:57.657 --> 01:00.285
Ow!

01:00.360 --> 01:04.090
I'm fine. I'm OK. I'm all right.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.189
I'm just gonna walk for a while.

01:06.266 --> 01:09.030
I've been sitting
for the last 30 hours, so...

01:09.636 --> 01:14.005
I'm a lawyer. I work at Wethersby,
Posner & Klein in San Francisco.

01:14.107 --> 01:17.440
Unless you own a huge company
that's screwed over a little guy,

01:17.510 --> 01:19.478
you probably haven't heard of us.

01:21.781 --> 01:26.343
Guys? Guys, guys, guys!
Could you take my picture?

01:26.419 --> 01:31.789
Here, that light's gonna come on
when it's ready to flash.

01:35.862 --> 01:37.921
What do you think, sunglasses?

01:39.165 --> 01:40.723
No, no sunglasses.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.330
Let's see... lawyer, San Francisco...

01:45.405 --> 01:48.863
Oh, did I mention I recently
found out I could be a prophet?

01:48.942 --> 01:51.240
Yeah. I was shocked, too.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.871
See, until recently,
my belief in a higher power

01:53.947 --> 01:57.110
was limited to worshipping
the Holy Trinity of: Armani...

01:58.952 --> 02:04.083
...accessories,
and my personal favorite, ambition.

02:05.358 --> 02:08.020
OK, so maybe
I wasn't exactly saint-like.

02:08.828 --> 02:12.195
But I didn't mind that I wasn't
the idealistic kid I used to be.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.028
I was too busy being "that guy. "

02:14.100 --> 02:17.263
The guy you see in an office
or across a restaurant and think,

02:17.370 --> 02:21.238
"That guy has it all. "
Hell, I thought I did.

02:22.442 --> 02:24.000
And then I heard the music.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.681
Insert caption. Opening paragraph.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.841
"Defendant Beutel Pharmaceutical,"

02:30.917 --> 02:33.613
comma, Inc. L-N-C period,
comma, space...

02:38.158 --> 02:41.719
Open paren, "Hereinafter," quote,
Beutel, close quote, close paren.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.194
Pursuant to Rules 26 and 33

02:44.264 --> 02:47.358
of the Federal Rules of...

02:47.433 --> 02:48.900
Patti!

02:50.837 --> 02:54.796
There's an intercom, Brando. I swear,
it's like we work in a cleaners.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.809
Do you hear that music?
It's been playing all morning.

02:57.877 --> 02:59.640
What music?

03:01.748 --> 03:04.808
There was music. Maybe you
could do something about it.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.182
Want me to do something
about music I can't hear?

03:07.253 --> 03:10.086
Forget it. Is my 2:30 here?

03:10.156 --> 03:13.922
They're in the conference room.
Also, the fiancÃ©e called.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.928
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You told me not to bother you.

03:16.996 --> 03:20.557
- Since when does Taylor bother me?
- All right, I was thinking of me.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.125
There's a moratorium on discussion
concerning my future wife.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.435
That includes e-mails,
nasty facial expressions,

03:27.507 --> 03:29.737
and not telling me
when she's on the phone.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.039
You take all the fun out of this job.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.072
Sixty thousand?

03:37.016 --> 03:38.176
Sixty thousand?

03:38.284 --> 03:40.650
Saying the number twice
doesn't double it.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.211
- Gonna have to add another zero.
- Really?

03:43.289 --> 03:47.316
OK. Let's see...
60,000 plus zero equals...

03:47.393 --> 03:49.657
Wait, 60,000!

03:50.630 --> 03:53.190
What about 80?

03:53.299 --> 03:54.823
No.

03:56.669 --> 03:57.636
I... I'm...

04:00.073 --> 04:02.769
What is that,
like an organ or something?

04:04.310 --> 04:07.279
My cell phone plays Ode to Joy,
but it's on vibrate.

04:07.347 --> 04:11.875
Three law degrees, and all you guys can
talk about is organ music and ringtones?

04:11.951 --> 04:14.385
The reason I came today
was because I thought

04:14.454 --> 04:16.887
Beutel was interested
in doing the right thing.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.891
Miss Keller, your case
was adjudicated by the Vaccine Court.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.723
They determined our client's vaccine
didn't cause your son's autism.

04:22.829 --> 04:26.788
Except for "client," "son," and
"autism," every word was wrong.

04:26.866 --> 04:30.393
It wasn't your client's vaccine,
it was a preservative in it.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.906
It wasn't a court, it was
a procedural hoop I had to jump through.

04:33.973 --> 04:37.238
Didn't say your client's vaccine
didn't cause my son's autism,

04:37.310 --> 04:40.746
- only I couldn't prove it.
- Still can't. No credible scientist.

04:40.813 --> 04:44.146
No repeatable study has been able
to prove a causal connection

04:44.217 --> 04:46.117
between Mercuritol and autism.

04:46.185 --> 04:49.951
Then why is Beutel the only vaccine
manufacturer who still uses it?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.547
You really wanna find out?

04:51.624 --> 04:54.092
Lobby Beutel's board
to make you the CEO.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.994
You've got about as much chance of that
as you do of winning this at trial.

04:58.064 --> 05:02.023
It would still be a trial, Mr. Dowd.
If the jury doesn't believe me,

05:02.135 --> 05:04.797
maybe everybody reading
about the trial will.

05:04.871 --> 05:08.602
Maybe they'll not use your client's
product to vaccinate their kids.

05:08.675 --> 05:11.838
Do you know the first thing
I learned about litigation?

05:11.911 --> 05:14.607
Clients won't know if you pad the bill?

05:14.681 --> 05:16.410
OK, the second thing.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.781
Litigation is only about what you
can prove in a court of law.

05:19.852 --> 05:23.618
Now, we can offer you $90,000.

05:23.723 --> 05:26.886
I sincerely recommend you take it
and get on with your life.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.330
Ninety's good.

05:39.105 --> 05:43.439
- The music? You hear the music?
- Yes! Yes, I hear the music!

05:43.509 --> 05:45.670
No, seriously, there's music playing.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.810
George Michael! That's who it is!

05:54.887 --> 05:57.014
What the hell are you talking about?

05:57.090 --> 05:58.648
His song... Faith!

05:59.359 --> 06:02.522
Not to be a prude, but I've got
a deposition at 8:00 tomorrow,

06:02.628 --> 06:04.562
could we forgo role-playing?

06:04.630 --> 06:08.589
Not role-playing. His song, Faith,
it's been following me around all day!

06:08.701 --> 06:13.070
- A song has been following you?
- Seriously, you don't hear it?

06:13.139 --> 06:16.074
If I say yes,
will you come back to bed?

06:16.142 --> 06:19.908
- It's coming from the living room!
- I'm glad something's coming!

06:49.342 --> 06:52.778
If you build it, he will come.

06:52.845 --> 06:56.906
- That's not funny, Nathan.
- Yeah, I was afraid of that.

06:56.983 --> 07:00.419
It doesn't look good, little brother.

07:00.486 --> 07:03.751
You have conjoined butts
in your cranium, which actually...

07:03.823 --> 07:06.690
It makes you a double butthead.

07:06.759 --> 07:11.128
Look, aside from the mild concussion
you got when your head hit the planter,

07:11.197 --> 07:13.688
you are, in medical terms,
what we call "fine. "

07:13.766 --> 07:16.792
I can't be fine. George Michael
was in my living room.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.429
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's just stress.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.474
Stress gives you premature grays.
It doesn't make pop stars

07:22.575 --> 07:24.338
sing their hits live from your couch.

07:24.444 --> 07:28.972
Just typical bonehead Eli. The second
you get your life together, you ruin it.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.208
Call Mom, would you?

07:30.316 --> 07:32.409
What am I to do
if George Michael comes back?

07:32.485 --> 07:33.452
Get an autograph.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.282
Eli.

07:38.691 --> 07:41.159
Eli? Eli!

07:42.261 --> 07:43.489
And you say I yell.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.896
That's the number for my acupuncturist,
Dr. Chen, in Chinatown.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.230
He's a miracle worker. My friend Viv,

07:49.302 --> 07:53.671
he cured her tennis elbow
and constipation in one visit.

07:53.739 --> 07:57.300
Well, good for Viv. But I don't
believe in that stuff, so...

07:57.410 --> 08:02.347
For a guy with auditory hallucinations
you sure are judgmental.

08:02.415 --> 08:06.112
- Your 2:00 is here.
- I don't have a 2:00.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.446
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.459
Patti! Don't speak,
it'd be an ex parte conversation.

08:14.527 --> 08:17.690
- You're represented by counsel.
- Not anymore. I fired him.

08:17.797 --> 08:21.233
Have your new attorney contact me.
In the meantime, have a nice day.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.861
- Patti can validate your parking.
- I realized the only way I can win,

08:24.971 --> 08:28.134
is if I have an attorney who plays
at Dowd's level. I found him.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.768
Graduated valedictorian at
Stanford Law, clerked for Ginsburg,

08:31.844 --> 08:34.404
he's an eighth-year associate
at a blue chip firm.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.347
You're talking about me.
Why are you talking about me?

08:37.416 --> 08:40.283
Because I want you
to take my case, Mr. Stone.

08:40.352 --> 08:44.083
That's impossible!
I can't sue my own client.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.420
There's a canon of ethics
prohibiting it,

08:46.492 --> 08:49.154
and they call it a canon
because it could kill me.

08:49.228 --> 08:52.959
Blake v. Elkin,
Overmyer v. Fordes, an article from...

08:53.032 --> 08:55.000
See, this is why the Internet is evil.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.900
Your firm sets up something
called a "Chinese Wall. "

08:57.970 --> 08:59.597
Look...

09:00.806 --> 09:04.298
...I might be able to squeeze
an extra ten grand out of Beutel.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.869
- Now, that's $100,000.
- That vaccine made my son sick,

09:07.947 --> 09:10.245
and it's still on the market.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.919
Well... I...

09:16.055 --> 09:17.818
I'm sorry.

09:19.659 --> 09:23.186
Yeah. Oh, well.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.093
I had to try, right?

09:31.871 --> 09:33.839
Bye, Eli.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.494
Hi, hi.

11:02.561 --> 11:04.927
Your place is not
that easy to locate.

11:05.031 --> 11:08.762
I'm no marketer, but a little
signage would do you wonders.

11:08.834 --> 11:12.497
People who need, find Dr. Chen.
Now, relax. Close eye.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.406
Oh, relax and close my eyes.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.205
You smart, must be good lawyer.

11:20.613 --> 11:23.309
You say George Michael
have great meaning to you?

11:23.382 --> 11:26.283
I say George Michael
was in my living room.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.118
- He doesn't have great meaning.
- Yes. You no remember.

11:30.222 --> 11:34.556
- I no remember because he doesn't.
- You must make peace George Michael.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.289
Maybe I should call his publicist.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.695
Dr. Chen help you remember.

11:46.839 --> 11:50.605
- Is this your first time?
- No, I...

11:50.676 --> 11:54.737
How would you define "first time?"

11:54.814 --> 11:56.941
I thought so.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.677
OK, we need some music.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.753
Oh, my God, Eli. You have
a George Michael album?

12:04.323 --> 12:07.349
What are you doing with
a George Michael album?

12:07.426 --> 12:09.656
It's my roommate's. He's in theater.

12:10.296 --> 12:13.663
Ooh, ooh, I can't lose it
to George Michael.

12:13.766 --> 12:15.324
Well, we can just make out then.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.895
Or it could make the
whole experience more memorable.

12:24.243 --> 12:27.406
You're cute, Eli. In a geeky,
late bloomer-ish sort of way.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.209
I've bloomed.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.614
Not yet you haven't. But you will.

12:33.719 --> 12:36.279
By the time you're that lawyer
changing the world,

12:36.355 --> 12:40.052
you are gonna be hot.

12:45.164 --> 12:49.100
UCLA, 1991!
You were Lizzie then, not Beth.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.796
Your hair was straight,
we had sex to George Michael.

12:51.871 --> 12:53.498
Fifteen years ago but it was you.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.938
My hair was never straight.
I used a flatiron.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.703
- Why didn't you say something?
- It was one night.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.541
It's not like you remembered me.

13:00.646 --> 13:04.082
We were stoned on pot brownies
and had a random college hook-up.

13:04.150 --> 13:07.449
- So use me for sex, toss me aside...
- Like most guys want?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.784
- I'm not most guys.
- You're most lawyers.

13:10.489 --> 13:11.979
That's not fair.

13:21.066 --> 13:23.330
Hey, Ben?

13:23.402 --> 13:26.235
Ben, this is Eli.
Eli is a friend of mommy's.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.309
He's not, uh...

13:33.012 --> 13:34.775
I'm not...

13:34.880 --> 13:38.247
Yeah, I was pregnant for eight years.

13:41.587 --> 13:45.318
Sweetie, can you please say hello?

13:45.391 --> 13:46.756
Huh?

13:54.033 --> 13:55.660
So you like blocks, huh?

13:55.734 --> 13:59.295
Words. There's over 500,000
in the English language.

14:00.739 --> 14:04.175
That's a lot. They should collect
them all in a book or something.

14:04.243 --> 14:07.770
That's not counting names.
I'm counting them with names.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.315
What is it, Eli?

14:21.994 --> 14:24.622
Come by my office tomorrow at 10:00.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.026
- You're gonna take the case?
- No. I'm gonna be getting fired.

14:29.101 --> 14:32.332
- I'm gonna request to take the case.
- Look, I want you to do this,

14:32.404 --> 14:35.703
- but not out of pity or sympathy.
- It's not sympathy.

14:35.774 --> 14:40.143
There's over 500,000 words
in the English language and...

14:40.246 --> 14:42.407
...that's not counting names.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.072
Bear with me, Mr. Stone.

15:12.177 --> 15:15.203
I don't understand.
Is there some problem with the case?

15:15.281 --> 15:16.771
No. The case is going great.

15:16.849 --> 15:21.343
The sole exception being
that you wish to switch sides?

15:21.420 --> 15:24.583
We represent clients
with conflicting interests.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.023
The Japanese Wall
you were talking about?

15:27.092 --> 15:28.616
- It's Chinese.
- Whichever.

15:28.694 --> 15:31.185
In those situations,
the clients can pay.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.564
Mr. Stone, are you OK?

15:38.871 --> 15:41.339
I'm fine. Totally fine.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.536
- Mr. Dowd, you're atypically quiet.
- Yeah, sorry.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.942
I was redecorating
Stone's office in my head.

15:47.012 --> 15:51.381
Ordinarily, we offer quixotic plaintiffs
nuisance value to go away.

15:51.450 --> 15:56.353
- We did. Stone upped the offer to 90.
- A hundred, actually.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.687
- She came by my office.
- Let me see if I'm understanding this.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.454
You had an ex parte conversation
with the plaintiff?

16:02.528 --> 16:07.056
Oh, well, it wouldn't be ex parte
if you let me represent her... sir.

16:07.132 --> 16:10.659
Explain to me, Mr. Stone,
the rationale for upsetting a client

16:10.736 --> 16:15.196
of Beutel's magnitude on a case
which is a complete and utter loser?

16:16.008 --> 16:17.441
Well, because, sir...

16:18.944 --> 16:20.377
...it'll make us rich.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.811
More rich.

16:25.684 --> 16:28.380
We all know that pro bono
work is good for business.

16:28.454 --> 16:31.116
And this case, as you pointed out,
Mr. Wethersby,

16:31.190 --> 16:33.750
is "a complete and utter loser. "

16:34.159 --> 16:38.186
Therefore, the firm can reap the
financial and public relations windfalls

16:38.263 --> 16:40.561
without putting our bottom line at risk.

16:42.267 --> 16:45.566
What is this I hear about
the Seven Horsemen of the Apocalypse

16:45.637 --> 16:49.198
- letting you represent that woman?
- Her name's Beth.

16:49.274 --> 16:52.368
Now ask Dan to get me points and
authorities on Chinese Walls...

16:53.746 --> 16:55.714
There it is again! You hear that?

16:57.149 --> 16:59.049
Who is it this time, hmm?
Cyndi Lauper?

16:59.118 --> 17:01.279
Billy Joel? The Go-Go's?

17:01.387 --> 17:04.288
It's not music. It's a bell.
Like a dinging.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.723
Did you fall down a flight of stairs
or start taking ecstasy?

17:07.792 --> 17:11.694
Maybe you fell down a flight of stairs
because you are high on ecstasy?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.292
Hold on! Hold on!

17:24.742 --> 17:26.904
Come on, Eli, hurry up!

17:28.247 --> 17:29.714
Come on, Eli!

17:43.028 --> 17:46.862
There was a voice this time.
I'm pretty sure it was my dead father.

17:46.932 --> 17:50.868
- Hmm, dead parent, different needle.
- You don't understand.

17:50.936 --> 17:53.769
My father was a drunk
who ruined everything he touched.

17:53.839 --> 17:56.171
He's the last person
I need to be hearing from.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.677
No good hate dead people. Relax.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.908
Think good memory father.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.142
Dr. Chen help ungrateful son.

18:08.487 --> 18:11.217
Come on, Eli, hurry up!

18:20.499 --> 18:24.265
Your mom told me about your debate
trophy. Sorry I couldn't be there.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.269
Because you were drunk again.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.243
Here.

18:33.579 --> 18:36.707
A celebration present
for winning the tournament.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.751
Those are the Panch Chuli peaks.
They're in India.

18:39.818 --> 18:43.777
I always wanted to see them.
We'll go someday.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.991
"For Eli. So you'll remember. "

18:48.994 --> 18:52.862
- Remember what?
- That you're meant to do great things.

18:52.931 --> 18:56.833
You're gonna go to beautiful places
and speak inspiring words.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.132
That you're gonna help people.

19:03.509 --> 19:05.033
Dad, you OK?

19:07.579 --> 19:10.309
Yeah. Yeah. Sure, kiddo.

19:10.382 --> 19:13.681
Hey, there's one more stop
I gotta make, actually.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.121
Tell your mother
I'll be home in a little bit.

19:27.866 --> 19:31.893
Ben was a dream infant.
He barely ever cried or got fussy.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.939
Picked himself up
at ten months, walked at 12.

19:35.007 --> 19:38.374
But at 23 months, everything changed.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.638
Right after his two-year check-up,

19:40.746 --> 19:44.238
his pediatrician gave him
a Beutel Pharmaceutical flu shot.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.876
Within a week,
he was a totally different child.

19:46.952 --> 19:50.012
He went from smiling all the time
to not at all.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.750
He used to run around the house
like a live wire.

19:52.824 --> 19:57.284
Now his idea of playtime
is stacking objects in rows.

19:57.362 --> 20:02.231
When he calls for me, which he
hardly ever does, he calls me "Beth. "

20:02.301 --> 20:07.762
- Your Honor. "He calls me Beth?"
- Mr. Stone, please approach.

20:11.510 --> 20:14.638
- Are you Mr. Stone?
- I figured I could hear this.

20:14.713 --> 20:19.207
An overestimation on my part.
Now I'm walking away.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.580
Your Honor, we know
the only chance I have

20:22.688 --> 20:25.987
is for jurors to identify
with my client on an emotional level.

20:26.058 --> 20:29.960
Not my problem. My decision
to let you represent the Kellers

20:30.028 --> 20:33.156
should've come wrapped in a box
with a ribbon, understand?

20:33.232 --> 20:37.328
You're drawing an analogy between
your decision and a gift, Your Honor.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.768
And now I'm walking away.

20:40.372 --> 20:45.332
But Miss Keller, isn't it a leap
to blame a vaccine for Ben's autism?

20:45.877 --> 20:48.437
That vaccine changed my son.

20:48.547 --> 20:52.881
One week he was happy and healthy,
and the next week he was autistic.

20:52.951 --> 20:56.318
What kind of CEO would I be,
what kind of human would I be,

20:56.388 --> 20:59.516
if I allowed my company to use
a preservative in its vaccine

20:59.591 --> 21:02.617
- that caused autism?
- Why not get rid of the preservative,

21:02.694 --> 21:03.752
just to be sure?

21:03.829 --> 21:07.321
Then I couldn't market
the vaccine at an affordable cost.

21:07.399 --> 21:12.132
Look, I'm a parent myself, and believe
me, no level of risk is acceptable.

21:12.204 --> 21:16.038
But there is no risk, no connection
between Mercuritol and autism.

21:16.108 --> 21:20.272
Beth Keller said her son became autistic
one week after exposure to it.

21:20.379 --> 21:24.611
The truth is no one knows
what causes autism.

21:24.683 --> 21:28.244
In the absence of an explanation,
Miss Keller has blamed my company

21:28.353 --> 21:32.813
and a product that has saved the
lives of tens of thousands of children.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.853
We're going to lose, aren't we?

21:35.961 --> 21:40.330
I'm sorry if telling you how we have no
chance of winning, I got your hopes up.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.467
Maybe Sean was right.

21:43.535 --> 21:46.993
My ex, he said all the money in
the world wasn't gonna make Ben better.

21:47.072 --> 21:50.735
That I was obsessed with
our son's illness and I should give up.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.572
Is that why you guys split?

21:52.644 --> 21:54.771
Ours wasn't a load-bearing marriage,

21:54.846 --> 21:58.373
but after Ben was diagnosed,
there was just no way.

21:58.450 --> 22:01.476
I hope I'm interrupting something.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.384
We better get going. Come on, Ben.

22:09.227 --> 22:13.596
What a nice woman.
Cute, too. Is she available?

22:13.699 --> 22:15.826
I'm ignoring you.

22:15.901 --> 22:16.959
What's that?

22:17.035 --> 22:20.061
A "Break off your engagement,
I'm begging you" present.

22:20.138 --> 22:23.767
An internal Beutel document.
Gee, thanks, Patti, you shouldn't have.

22:23.842 --> 22:27.608
Says that, "... suggests a possible
correlation between Mercuritol

22:27.679 --> 22:30.614
and cognitive dysfunction,
including autism. "

22:31.383 --> 22:32.748
This is a study?

22:32.818 --> 22:35.787
Proving they thought
Mercuritol might be dangerous.

22:35.854 --> 22:39.017
- Where did you get this?
- A paralegal who works for Matt Dowd.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.991
I lent her my tampons when she ran out.

22:42.060 --> 22:45.427
First, ew... And second, do you have
any idea what you've done?

22:45.530 --> 22:48.021
This document's
attorney-client privilege!

22:48.100 --> 22:50.398
I can't use it.
I can't even know about it!

22:50.469 --> 22:53.495
I could get fired, disbarred, killed.
Not in that order!

22:53.572 --> 22:56.473
- Don't whisper-yell at me!
- Don't try to get me fired!

22:56.541 --> 22:59.476
Well, you're the genius
with the Stanford diploma.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.172
Figure something out. God!

23:06.184 --> 23:11.645
So his father and I
went outside to find Eli,

23:11.723 --> 23:14.419
naked, covered in feathers

23:14.493 --> 23:17.360
- and chocolate syrup.
- Thanks, Mom.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.761
- And thank you, too.
- Oh, come on, I was ten.

23:19.831 --> 23:22.061
Just be glad I couldn't find tar.

23:22.134 --> 23:26.366
That would be my parents.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.608
- Eli.
- Hi.

23:34.913 --> 23:39.009
- Eli.
- Mr. Wethersby... Jordan.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.555
- Hello, princess.
- Hey, Daddy.

23:44.623 --> 23:45.715
Hello.

24:02.007 --> 24:03.338
You're a brave man, Eli.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.608
For getting engaged
to the boss's daughter?

24:06.678 --> 24:09.442
That's not bravery, that's stupidity.

24:09.548 --> 24:11.482
I meant taking on the Beutel matter.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.082
I would have to agree.

24:14.152 --> 24:17.519
Beutel's lawyers have been dealing
from the bottom of the deck.

24:17.622 --> 24:21.752
If you're referring to the Beutel study,
which I suspect you are, be careful.

24:21.827 --> 24:25.092
It's an ethical violation
for you to be in possession of it.

24:25.163 --> 24:27.791
Well, it was a violation
for you not to produce it,

24:27.866 --> 24:29.595
so I guess that makes us even.

24:29.668 --> 24:32.432
In point of fact,
I didn't have to produce it.

24:32.537 --> 24:36.598
Not after one of my associates stepped
forward to take the plaintiff's case,

24:36.675 --> 24:41.135
effectively allowing me to seal it
behind, what's it called again,

24:41.213 --> 24:45.479
a Chinese Wall? In any case,
that's why I'll be in court tomorrow.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.519
Congratulations on the engagement.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.589
It'll be a pleasure
to have you in the family.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.831
- Eli, stop!
- Don't! Don't jump!

25:34.900 --> 25:38.131
- Please! Eli!
- Don't jump!

25:38.203 --> 25:40.296
Look at me!
Look at me! Listen.

25:40.372 --> 25:41.862
- Just come down!
- Please!

25:41.940 --> 25:45.501
What are you doing?
Step down off the railing, Eli!

25:45.577 --> 25:47.135
- Please, come down!
- Don't!

26:00.125 --> 26:04.494
What you did last night, I realized that
I'd seen that kind of behavior before.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.327
We both have... with Dad.

26:07.399 --> 26:11.096
Hallucinations, seeing people,
hearing things that aren't there.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.399
Stop me when this doesn't
sound familiar.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.632
What does this
have to do with your father?

26:15.740 --> 26:18.766
Well, I had always associated
his episodes with alcohol,

26:18.843 --> 26:21.937
but it seems clear that he was
suffering from something else.

26:22.013 --> 26:24.038
There was just no way
of knowing it then.

26:24.783 --> 26:28.913
I took your MRI
to our neurology chief, and...

26:30.555 --> 26:33.888
...he found something.
- Found what?

26:36.161 --> 26:39.995
Brain aneurysm.
It's about three millimeters in size.

26:40.065 --> 26:42.932
We wouldn't have found it
unless we knew what to look for.

26:43.001 --> 26:46.129
Now, intracranial aneurysms
can be hereditary.

26:46.204 --> 26:49.537
It is not uncommon for them
to afflict the same area of the brain

26:49.608 --> 26:54.170
in a parent and a child. In this case,
it is in the right cerebral artery.

26:54.279 --> 26:57.612
Any disruption of blood flow
in this area would account for...

26:58.683 --> 27:02.210
...delusions of grandeur
or hallucinations.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.584
Uh...

27:05.824 --> 27:07.382
When do you take it out?

27:07.492 --> 27:11.053
Because it is located
so deep in the cortex,

27:11.129 --> 27:14.690
according to the chief neurosurgeon,

27:14.799 --> 27:17.859
it's not amenable
to surgical intervention.

27:26.011 --> 27:29.276
- What if it bursts?
- It might not.

27:30.115 --> 27:33.084
A lot of people live
their whole lives with aneurysms,

27:33.184 --> 27:36.119
and then they die of perfectly bor...

27:36.755 --> 27:38.313
Perfectly boring things.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.851
I'm so sorry, Eli.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.964
I'll let you two talk.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.975
Well, we should probably
move the wedding up.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.872
It's not funny.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.609
I don't know if I can do this, Eli.

28:07.652 --> 28:11.019
I mean, the visions, the odd behavior,
I could take all that.

28:12.891 --> 28:16.759
- The idea of losing you at any moment?
- Are you breaking up with me?

28:18.496 --> 28:22.455
'Cause I was just diagnosed
with a brain aneurysm.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.900
That would be really
bad timing on your part.

28:24.969 --> 28:27.437
I am just trying to process all of this.

28:30.942 --> 28:33.968
- Eli, where are you going?
- I'm late for court.

28:40.685 --> 28:42.778
The plaintiff recalls Alan Cooke.

28:50.161 --> 28:52.925
- What's your child's name, sir?
- Objection.

28:52.997 --> 28:56.455
Earlier, Mr. Cooke mentioned
having a child. He opened the door.

28:56.534 --> 28:57.694
Overruled.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.100
- Your child's name, sir?
- Jenna.

29:01.172 --> 29:04.300
- Did Jenna ever receive a flu vaccine?
- Several, I'm sure.

29:04.375 --> 29:07.538
Were any of them manufactured
by Beutel Pharmaceutical?

29:07.645 --> 29:09.010
Objection!

29:09.080 --> 29:11.640
Hell, no. Now we're getting somewhere.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.283
Well, Mr. Cooke?

29:15.353 --> 29:20.290
I believe the choice of vaccine
was Jenna's pediatrician's decision.

29:25.430 --> 29:29.867
Mr. Cooke, do you recognize the man in
the glasses who just entered the room?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.534
That's Dr. Varga, Jenna's pediatrician.

29:34.639 --> 29:38.507
Or as I prefer to call him,
my next witness.

29:38.943 --> 29:41.707
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time, Mr. Cooke,

29:41.780 --> 29:46.114
to the best of your knowledge, did
Jenna ever receive a Beutel vaccine?

29:47.352 --> 29:49.684
No. She did not.

29:51.156 --> 29:56.059
- Was that at your request, sir?
- Yes... it was.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.463
We're prepared to offer $360,000.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.124
Sealed.

30:04.202 --> 30:07.365
No admission of liability.
Check by the end of business.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.498
I'm sorry. No.

30:10.575 --> 30:12.736
- No, what?
- No, I don't accept.

30:12.811 --> 30:16.941
I want Mercuritol taken out of Beutel's
vaccines, I want them to set up a fund

30:17.015 --> 30:21.111
- for any other kids it made autistic.
- Could you guys give us a few minutes?

30:32.163 --> 30:34.688
Beth, what I did in there was a stunt.

30:34.766 --> 30:37.462
Matt's going to go back
and clean up the mess I made.

30:37.535 --> 30:41.027
We're down to summations here,
and I'd have to give the one of my life

30:41.105 --> 30:43.801
and get struck by lightning
for us to have a chance.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.536
I'm not gonna take their bribe.

30:45.610 --> 30:49.307
If you don't take the offer,
you're going to get nothing. Nothing!

30:49.380 --> 30:53.510
Wow, yeah, OK, you're right.
We're gonna lose.

30:53.585 --> 30:57.112
But not because of Matt Dowd
or Beutel or burdens of proof.

30:57.188 --> 31:00.680
We are gonna lose because
when you give the closing argument,

31:00.758 --> 31:03.818
the jury's going to look in your eyes
and they're gonna see

31:03.895 --> 31:05.863
that you don't believe.

31:07.465 --> 31:11.231
For the first time,
I feel sorrier for you than I do for me.

31:15.473 --> 31:16.940
Come on, Ben.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.524
You always show up no appointment.

31:37.595 --> 31:39.961
Dr. Chen not Jiffy Lube.
Come back Friday.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.896
I went to the doctor, the real kind.

31:42.734 --> 31:46.465
Wouldn't happen to have any needles
for an inoperable brain aneurysm

31:46.537 --> 31:50.496
I inherited from my alcoholic father,
who I've wrongly hated for 20 years?

31:52.677 --> 31:54.975
Oh, wow. That totally blows, bro.

31:55.713 --> 32:00.047
- What happened to your accent?
- It's a long story. Want a beer?

32:03.154 --> 32:08.592
I grew up on a commune. From there,
UC Berkeley, philosophy major.

32:08.660 --> 32:12.721
But there's no future in Existentialist
Ethics, so I got into acupuncture.

32:12.797 --> 32:16.699
Unfortunately, nobody wants an
acupuncturist named Frank Lebakowski.

32:16.768 --> 32:21.637
They want incense, mystique, a foreign
accent, you know, they want Dr. Chen.

32:21.706 --> 32:24.197
Great. Even my treatments
were imaginary.

32:24.275 --> 32:28.041
Eight years of coursework in
holistic medicine, two years in Beijing.

32:28.146 --> 32:31.775
Give me some props.
Now, tell me about this latest vision.

32:31.849 --> 32:35.478
This is pointless. It's my
defective brain playing tricks on me.

32:35.553 --> 32:39.489
Everything has two explanations, Eli,
the scientific and the divine.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.889
It's up to us to choose
which one we buy into.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.724
Science explains
the enlarged vessel in your head.

32:44.796 --> 32:48.562
It explain how the girl you lost
your virginity to happened to be suing

32:48.666 --> 32:52.432
your law firm, how her son happened
to spell a message with his blocks?

32:52.537 --> 32:55.802
OK, so what would your divine
explanation for all of this be?

32:55.873 --> 33:00.776
Almost all religions believe there are
those sent to help us find our way.

33:00.845 --> 33:04.372
- Some people call them prophets.
- A prophet?

33:04.449 --> 33:08.351
You think I'm a prophet. Like Moses?

33:08.853 --> 33:12.755
God told Moses he'd send
a prophet to every generation.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.190
Why not a lawyer?
A high-profile attorney

33:15.259 --> 33:18.592
handling cases that got notoriety
the world would read about?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.029
Difference between
those guys and me is...

33:21.899 --> 33:24.459
...I don't believe in God.
- Sure you do.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.730
You believe in right and wrong.

33:26.804 --> 33:30.103
You believe in justice, in fairness.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.472
And you believe in love.

33:32.543 --> 33:34.773
All those things, they're God, Eli.

33:36.981 --> 33:40.940
And that... that's God, too.

33:48.626 --> 33:52.289
The first lawsuit alleging a connection
between tobacco and cancer

33:52.363 --> 33:57.995
was filed in 1954, but it took 30 years
for a jury to award a single dollar

33:58.069 --> 34:01.129
for something we now
all accept as patently true.

34:01.205 --> 34:04.902
Is there proof
Mercuritol causes autism? Yes.

34:04.976 --> 34:08.342
That proof direct or
incontrovertible proof? No.

34:08.413 --> 34:11.177
But ask if you've believed in anything,

34:11.248 --> 34:15.185
in anyone, without absolute proof.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.619
That's called faith,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:17.688 --> 34:20.918
And, make no mistake,
this is very much a case about faith.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.886
It's about Beth Keller's faith.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.828
She placed her faith in Beutel

34:27.899 --> 34:32.199
when she exposed her child to a vaccine
Mr. Cooke wouldn't give his daughter.

34:32.270 --> 34:35.831
She placed faith in the justice system
to hold Beutel accountable.

34:35.907 --> 34:40.639
And now she's here, putting that same
unshakable faith in the 12 of you.

34:42.013 --> 34:46.473
I don't have Beth Keller's faith,
but I do believe in some things.

34:47.717 --> 34:50.186
I believe in people.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.222
It's why I became a lawyer.

34:53.391 --> 34:57.487
I believe that most people
want to do what's right.

34:57.562 --> 35:00.122
And the right thing to do here

35:00.231 --> 35:04.327
is to remove Mercuritol
from Beutel's vaccines.

35:04.402 --> 35:06.734
Unfortunately, your verdict...

35:07.772 --> 35:10.138
...can't order them to do that.

35:11.409 --> 35:17.370
What you can do... is award
Beth Keller a judgment so high

35:17.482 --> 35:20.144
that Beutel feels
it has no other choice.

35:21.819 --> 35:24.583
Sadly, without that verdict,

35:24.655 --> 35:29.217
I don't have faith that Beutel
will do what's right.

35:33.998 --> 35:36.330
But I have faith that you will.

35:43.274 --> 35:44.935
How much longer?

35:46.444 --> 35:49.413
Juries don't award millions of dollars
in five minutes,

35:49.480 --> 35:51.311
so for us it's the longer the better.

35:53.918 --> 35:55.681
Eli.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.353
Someone came by the office.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.697
- Mom?
- Your brother told me everything.

36:07.732 --> 36:11.190
I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

36:11.269 --> 36:12.236
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

36:12.336 --> 36:15.396
Yeah, apart from the,
you know, aneurysm.

36:21.479 --> 36:22.844
I had no idea.

36:22.947 --> 36:26.974
It's horrible to think how much of
my life I've spent blaming your father

36:27.051 --> 36:30.020
- for something that wasn't his fault.
- Yeah, me too.

36:30.121 --> 36:32.555
It sure helps to explain a lot.

36:35.459 --> 36:38.189
That's the coffee can!
Where did you get that?

36:38.262 --> 36:40.992
It's your father. It's his ashes.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.899
You kept Dad in a coffee can?

36:44.969 --> 36:48.268
No, of course not.
I transported him in the coffee can.

36:48.339 --> 36:51.467
I didn't wanna traipse a
ten pound china urn across town.

36:52.443 --> 36:58.348
Honey... he wanted you
to have this... him.

36:58.950 --> 37:03.512
In his will, he expressed
a desire to be cremated.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.521
He wanted you to have the ashes.

37:05.590 --> 37:09.026
He said that one day
you would know what to do with them.

37:09.093 --> 37:12.256
Of course I thought
that was the request of a crazy person.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.264
I didn't want to burden you.

37:14.332 --> 37:20.168
But now... I'm hoping
you'll know what to do with them.

37:22.273 --> 37:23.831
I think I do.

37:25.776 --> 37:28.336
Jury's back.

37:28.946 --> 37:30.777
That quick?

37:30.848 --> 37:34.011
- Mom, I gotta go.
- It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

37:34.118 --> 37:36.678
I love you. It's OK.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.950
Patti, take my dad back to the office.

37:43.027 --> 37:46.360
I am not gonna even pretend
to understand that.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.421
Good luck.

37:48.599 --> 37:52.626
- You've never wished me luck before.
- I never cared whether you won before.

37:54.138 --> 37:56.163
Neither did I.

37:58.009 --> 38:01.467
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honor.

38:02.847 --> 38:07.409
In the matter of Beth Keller v.
Beutel Pharmaceutical Incorporated,

38:07.485 --> 38:12.513
as to the claim of product liability,
we find in favor of the plaintiff.

38:14.158 --> 38:16.649
And order the defendant to pay damages

38:16.727 --> 38:19.662
in the amount of $5.2 million.

38:22.566 --> 38:25.296
You heard that, too?
I've been hearing things lately.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.996
No, I heard it.

38:27.938 --> 38:29.769
OK, we all know what happens next.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.207
We appeal, appeal the appeal,
appeal the appeal of the appeal,

38:33.277 --> 38:36.440
run this thing out till Ben's
eligible for Social Security.

38:36.547 --> 38:38.845
A nice try,
but Beutel can't risk an appeal.

38:38.916 --> 38:41.976
- They can't risk the publicity.
- Speak quickly, Mr. Stone.

38:42.053 --> 38:43.486
Two million to the Kellers.

38:43.554 --> 38:47.115
The balance of the judgment invested
in a fund for autistic children.

38:47.191 --> 38:51.719
Mercuritol is removed from Beutel's
vaccines. Effective immediately.

38:53.931 --> 38:55.296
Write it up.

38:57.234 --> 38:58.792
Wait, one more thing.

39:00.604 --> 39:01.866
Eli keeps his job.

39:03.240 --> 39:06.403
He just won a
multi-million dollar jury verdict.

39:06.477 --> 39:09.139
We'd be hard-pressed
to explain letting him go.

39:09.213 --> 39:13.115
- I want your guarantee in writing.
- Shrewd.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.311
I'll have Mr. Dowd draft it up.

39:24.495 --> 39:28.158
Honestly, I don't know how to thank you.

39:28.232 --> 39:31.201
Oh, I think you just did,
with the "Eli keeps his job" bit.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.533
That was nothing.
You changed our lives.

39:35.339 --> 39:39.639
Well, I think I'm gonna be making
a few changes to mine, too.

39:39.710 --> 39:43.043
Don't be a stranger, OK? Thank you.

39:58.429 --> 40:01.921
The man of the hour.
It's all over the courthouse.

40:01.999 --> 40:04.433
What, that I'm back on the market?

40:06.771 --> 40:10.537
Wasn't exactly my finest moment
at the doctor's office.

40:11.409 --> 40:15.311
But I am sorry, Eli. I love you.

40:19.316 --> 40:20.840
I love you, too.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.183
And I want to be with you.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.922
- But...
- But...

40:27.992 --> 40:30.426
I have to go to India.

40:30.494 --> 40:34.055
Right this minute?
Or are you free for lunch?

40:40.938 --> 40:44.396
So that's my story.
It's got Sherpas and George Michael.

40:44.475 --> 40:48.104
It's got cable cars and prophecies
and mystical Chinese doctors,

40:48.179 --> 40:51.239
who aren't that mystical and
aren't really that Chinese.

40:51.315 --> 40:54.751
I have a feeling
that's just the beginning.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.720
Mom said you spent your whole life
with these visions.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.551
I had no idea.

41:01.992 --> 41:03.857
I'm sorry, Dad.

41:05.729 --> 41:09.495
I'm sorry for blaming you
for things that weren't your fault.

41:09.567 --> 41:13.867
And, most of all, I'm sorry that
I'm not the person that you said I'd be.

41:16.774 --> 41:18.435
I'm gonna change that.

41:21.679 --> 41:23.112
I promise.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.715
OK, guys...

41:36.460 --> 41:37.984
...let's go.
