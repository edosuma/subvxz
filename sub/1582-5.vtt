Did you know some historians
think American football

01:37.321 --> 01:39.556
is based on
an ancient Aztec game?

01:39.590 --> 01:42.225
It's not American football,
it's just football.

01:42.259 --> 01:44.427
Bart, you're not annoyed
that Milhouse asked me

01:44.462 --> 01:47.497
to go to the American football
game instead of you?

01:47.531 --> 01:50.099
Mom, Lisa's ruining football.
American football.

01:50.134 --> 01:53.503
No time for breakfast, Marge.
Just give me a banana.

Now, listen. I have
to work late tonight.

02:03.347 --> 02:06.583
Again? I was hoping you could
spend some time with the kids.

02:06.617 --> 02:09.818
It's a tough economy.
Money doesn't grow on trees.

02:09.854 --> 02:12.689
It grows on threes.

02:12.723 --> 02:14.290

02:14.325 --> 02:15.358
Yeah, I'm out.

02:15.392 --> 02:16.359

02:16.393 --> 02:17.760
Too rich for my blood.

02:17.795 --> 02:19.496

you like movies?

03:33.103 --> 03:35.057

that scene in <i>Alien.</i>

03:35.082 --> 03:35.972
What?

03:35.973 --> 03:38.908
The scene where she escapes

03:38.943 --> 03:40.743
Aw, well, that's sweet.

03:40.778 --> 03:43.413
Listen, I'm glad I'm not
going through this alone.

03:43.447 --> 03:45.415
I haven't seen
my boyfriend in months.

03:45.449 --> 03:48.551
Oh, uh, he was just here.

03:48.586 --> 03:49.919
No, he wasn't.

03:49.954 --> 03:51.120
But thanks for lying.

03:51.155 --> 03:52.922
You like lies?
Here's a few:

03:52.957 --> 03:55.725
College is expensive
but it's worth it.

03:55.759 --> 03:57.360
I think the baby's coming.

03:57.394 --> 03:59.729
Okay Homer, remember
your Lamaze training.

03:59.763 --> 04:02.599
Now, this next
position is fantastic

04:02.633 --> 04:05.702
for women who are
carrying especially big.

04:05.736 --> 04:07.470
Homer, can you demonstrate?

04:07.504 --> 04:09.105
Mm-hmm.

04:09.139 --> 04:10.373
Mm...

04:10.407 --> 04:13.876
Oh. Yeah, wow,
that does feel good.

04:13.911 --> 04:15.378
Oh, no, I think
it's coming.

04:15.412 --> 04:17.747
Oh, I haven't even
picked a name yet.

04:17.781 --> 04:20.048
You did this to me.

04:20.084 --> 04:21.050
No, I didn't.

04:21.084 --> 04:22.485
I'm talking to the baby.

04:22.519 --> 04:24.887
Here it comes.

04:24.922 --> 04:27.090
Um, I don't know
how to tell you this,

04:27.124 --> 04:30.126

What?

04:30.160 --> 04:31.327

They sell your posters,

10:14.474 --> 10:15.607
workout DVDs,

10:15.641 --> 10:16.775
and all of your practices

10:16.809 --> 10:18.410
are broadcast on a webcam.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.784
And some of the angles

10:25.818 --> 10:28.120
are low.

10:28.154 --> 10:30.021
But don't worry,
collective bargaining

10:30.056 --> 10:32.290
will enable us
to secure concessions.

10:33.559 --> 10:36.528
Uh, we're gonna push 'em back,

10:36.562 --> 10:39.464
push 'em back,
push 'em way, way back.

10:39.499 --> 10:41.199
All the way to a new contract.

10:41.234 --> 10:43.168
'Cause union power is a fact.

10:43.202 --> 10:44.870
And we're...

10:44.904 --> 10:46.338
Okay, okay, we get it.

10:46.372 --> 10:48.306
Well, look who's here.

10:48.341 --> 10:51.309
You been hit by the cheerleading
bug, little lady?

10:51.344 --> 10:55.046
Actually, I've been hit by
the unfair labor practices bug.

10:55.081 --> 10:58.350
What? Why, that's
Samuel Gompers talk.

10:58.384 --> 11:02.053
Now, little missy, the only
thing you should be organizin'

11:02.088 --> 11:03.555
is your dollies.

11:03.589 --> 11:06.892
How? By size, brand, value?

11:06.926 --> 11:09.227
And don't even suggest race,
'cause I don't see that.

11:09.262 --> 11:11.062
I just see little people I own.

11:11.097 --> 11:12.330
What do you say, ladies?

11:12.365 --> 11:14.065
(indistinct whispering)

11:14.100 --> 11:16.067
Not right, not fair.

11:16.102 --> 11:18.136
Let's say it with our hair.

11:23.042 --> 11:24.543
Okay, fine.

11:24.577 --> 11:26.211
I'm gonna give it some thought,

11:26.245 --> 11:29.080
then say no
in the nicest way possible.

11:29.115 --> 11:31.116
No.

11:35.888 --> 11:38.023
Oh, good.

11:38.057 --> 11:39.724
Nice.

11:39.759 --> 11:41.126
"Beat Dallas."

11:41.160 --> 11:43.762
Can never argue
with that.

11:43.796 --> 11:48.233
Hey, ladies. My vest isn't
the only thing that's ripped.

11:48.267 --> 11:50.769
I am in the market
for a backup mistress.

11:50.803 --> 11:52.137
Possibly two.

11:52.171 --> 11:54.039
Have you kids
seen your father?

11:54.073 --> 11:57.142
Surprised he's not here
ogling these girls.

11:57.176 --> 11:58.643
He said he was going to work.

11:58.678 --> 12:00.612
On a Friday afternoon?

12:00.646 --> 12:03.448
(gasps) I bet he's
playing poker again.

12:03.483 --> 12:04.549
Coming through.

12:04.584 --> 12:06.117
Wife on a mission.

12:06.152 --> 12:07.619
Go, fight, win.

12:07.653 --> 12:08.753
Marge.

12:10.523 --> 12:12.991
Wow, I've never burst
through a banner before,

12:13.025 --> 12:15.193
but it really does the trick.

12:15.228 --> 12:16.428
(pounding on door)

12:16.462 --> 12:18.897
Homer, I know you're here.

12:18.931 --> 12:20.499
Your car's outside.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.267
Where is he?

12:22.301 --> 12:23.935
I honestly
don't know.

12:23.970 --> 12:26.972
I'm just teaching myself massage
here with online videos

12:27.006 --> 12:28.106
and a store mannequin.

12:28.140 --> 12:31.176
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.512
So, do you have any injuries
I should know about?

12:33.546 --> 12:34.746
Oh!

12:34.780 --> 12:37.148
Hmm, if he's not in there,
where is he?

12:37.183 --> 12:38.850
HOMER:
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

12:38.885 --> 12:41.353
<i>Oh, baby, shake it.</i>
<i>Homer like.</i>

12:41.387 --> 12:43.755
(gasps)
Oh.

12:43.789 --> 12:46.424
Shake it. Now, roll
over on your tummy,

12:46.459 --> 12:47.759
just like I
taught you.

12:47.793 --> 12:49.928
<i>Tell me what</i>
<i>a cow says.</i>

12:49.962 --> 12:51.429
(toy moos)

12:51.464 --> 12:53.498
Aah!
My other baby mama.

12:53.533 --> 12:55.667
So this is where
you've been going.

12:55.701 --> 12:58.169
Another woman's
apartment.

12:58.204 --> 13:00.005
Marge, it's not
what you think.

13:00.039 --> 13:01.940
Quiet. You're
upsetting Homer Jr.

13:01.974 --> 13:04.442
(quietly):
You have a baby together?

13:04.477 --> 13:05.677
Oh, it's cool.

13:05.711 --> 13:07.479
We did it in an elevator.

13:07.513 --> 13:10.181
(gasps)
I'm a Schwarzenegger wife.

13:10.216 --> 13:13.151
But you're also the housekeeper,
so it's all good.

13:13.185 --> 13:14.219
It's not good.

13:14.253 --> 13:15.720
None of it's good.

13:15.755 --> 13:17.689
I haven't had a
drink for a week.

13:17.723 --> 13:19.124
That is pretty good.

13:22.397 --> 13:24.918
So then you
delivered her baby

13:24.919 --> 13:27.721
right there  in the elevator.
It's true.

13:27.755 --> 13:30.223
Even the other guy
in the elevator-- he's right here.

13:30.258 --> 13:32.592
And the really funny
thing is I'm a doctor.

13:34.128 --> 13:36.329
Well, I'm glad
you did a good deed,

13:36.364 --> 13:38.265
but you shouldn't
come here again.

13:38.299 --> 13:40.800
I thought that was
strange poop on your collar.

13:40.835 --> 13:42.168
(moans sadly)

13:42.203 --> 13:43.670
Good-bye, Homer Jr.

13:43.704 --> 13:45.772
I guess you're the
man of the house now.

13:45.806 --> 13:47.073
And never forget,

13:47.108 --> 13:49.409
even though the mortgage
is due on the first,

13:49.443 --> 13:52.345
you can usually wait
till the 17th.

13:52.380 --> 13:55.081
(sobbing)

13:55.116 --> 13:57.284
You know what?

13:57.318 --> 14:00.353
I think it's fine
if Homer spends a few hours

14:00.388 --> 14:01.921
now and then with...

14:01.956 --> 14:03.790
Homer Jr.

14:03.824 --> 14:05.191
Exactly.

14:05.226 --> 14:07.327
You always said
charity begins at home.

14:07.361 --> 14:08.795
But not which home.

14:08.829 --> 14:11.798
It's true, I never
specified the home.

15:02.383 --> 15:03.850
Late night at Moe's, eh?

15:03.884 --> 15:05.752
No, I'm exhausted from

15:08.289 --> 15:10.223

It's the toes.

15:11.592 --> 15:13.226
What about your
own children?

15:13.260 --> 15:16.096
Way ahead of you, Marge,
I'm taking all four

15:16.130 --> 15:18.031
of my kids to the zoo tomorrow.

15:18.065 --> 15:19.232
<i>Three.</i>

15:19.266 --> 15:20.567
Yes, we'll be back by 3:00.

15:20.601 --> 15:22.435
Homer has a very
tight nap schedule.

15:22.470 --> 15:24.704
Quit talking
about that baby.

15:24.739 --> 15:27.273
I was talking about myself
in the third person.

15:27.308 --> 15:28.842
Oh.

15:29.610 --> 15:31.678
We can't take
much more of this, Lisa.

15:31.712 --> 15:34.581
The girls are getting so antsy
they'll cheer anything.

15:34.615 --> 15:36.950
You're the greatest generation,

15:36.984 --> 15:39.519
worthy of our veneration.

15:39.553 --> 15:42.021
Go Grampa!

15:42.056 --> 15:45.792
If this is heaven,
why don't my shoes match?

15:45.826 --> 15:47.861
(doorbell rings)

15:47.895 --> 15:50.764
(deep sigh)
Okay, I give up.

15:50.798 --> 15:54.100
I'm gonna do what
we secretly did at the Alamo--

15:54.135 --> 15:55.402
surrender.

15:55.436 --> 15:56.803
(cheering)

15:56.837 --> 15:59.072
While you're at it,
how about a little boost

15:59.106 --> 16:00.573
for peanut vendors?

16:00.608 --> 16:03.910
What do you think
I'm taking their raise out of?

16:07.681 --> 16:10.483
(jabbering happily)

16:10.518 --> 16:12.285
I wanted you all
to be happy together,

16:12.319 --> 16:13.753
so I brought you
to the zoo

16:13.788 --> 16:16.656
where all the animals
live in harmony.

16:18.993 --> 16:20.326
(growls)

16:20.361 --> 16:22.061
(triumphant wail)

16:22.096 --> 16:24.130
Okay, guys,
I got your ice creams.

16:27.435 --> 16:29.002
Hey, ah, ah, ah.

16:29.036 --> 16:31.938
Now, Maggie, we don't
hurt each other in this family.

16:31.972 --> 16:33.573
Are you nuts?

16:33.607 --> 16:35.508
You can't even kiss me good
night without slicing me

16:35.543 --> 16:37.477
with your stubble.
Why you little...

16:37.511 --> 16:39.579
I'll give you a good-night kiss
you'll never forget.

16:39.613 --> 16:40.814
Come here, you.

16:40.848 --> 16:42.549
(grunting)
Aah, ooh, ah!

16:42.583 --> 16:44.984
Ah! Ow!
Yeah!

16:45.019 --> 16:49.355
Dad, we're missing the giant
capybaras of Uruguay.

16:52.126 --> 16:54.494
Okay, I know what'll
cheer you kids up.

16:54.528 --> 16:57.096
Seeing me out-monkey
the monkeys.

16:57.965 --> 16:59.966
(hooting like a monkey)

17:00.000 --> 17:02.001
(angry hooting, screeching)

17:02.036 --> 17:04.369
I have a soul
and you guys don't.

17:04.405 --> 17:05.472
(hooting)

17:05.506 --> 17:07.373
Aah! Monkeys!

17:09.343 --> 17:10.676
(grunts)

17:10.711 --> 17:12.779
(angry grunt)

17:17.885 --> 17:20.053
Dad, Maggie's rolling away.

17:20.087 --> 17:22.188
(gasps) She's heading for
Prairie Dog Village.

17:22.223 --> 17:23.690
If they get her
in their warrens,

17:23.723 --> 17:25.425
we'll never
see her again.

17:25.459 --> 17:26.960
(chittering)

17:26.993 --> 17:28.628
Look, shiny keys.

17:28.662 --> 17:29.696
Jingle jangle.

17:29.730 --> 17:32.232
(grunts, laughs)
Stupid monkeys.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.373
That's it, Maggie,
use the Dino-Wand.

17:48.883 --> 17:52.986
This is the last time
you'll see that elevator baby.

17:53.020 --> 17:55.655
I'm sorry,
Homer Jr.

17:55.689 --> 17:58.558
You'll occupy an idealized
place in my heart

17:58.592 --> 18:01.861
that no one can
ever quite fill.

18:01.896 --> 18:04.764
(Homer sobbing)

18:04.798 --> 18:07.901
Therapy, please.
Me, too.

18:07.935 --> 18:10.169
Okay, I've got to impart
all my fatherly advice

18:10.204 --> 18:11.704
in this one walk.

18:11.739 --> 18:14.841
The sky is blue,
but nobody really knows why.

18:14.875 --> 18:16.543
Don't believe
what they tell you.

18:16.577 --> 18:18.611
Girls are great and terrible
at the same time.

18:18.646 --> 18:20.079
Get used to it.

18:20.114 --> 18:22.382
And, most importantly...
Oops, we're here.

18:22.416 --> 18:24.551
You'll have to figure
it out on your own.

18:26.086 --> 18:28.454
Sorry, little fella.
One day I'll be that guy

18:28.489 --> 18:31.024
who comes to your wedding,
makes you feel a little weird,

18:31.058 --> 18:32.458
and then runs away.

18:32.493 --> 18:33.760
Homer, great news.

18:33.794 --> 18:35.194
Chase came back.

18:35.229 --> 18:36.963
(whoops)
Who's Chase?

18:36.997 --> 18:38.431
Homer Jr.'s father.

18:38.465 --> 18:41.568
Oh, my God,
is that my son?

18:41.602 --> 18:43.036
You didn't tell me
he was a soldier.

18:43.070 --> 18:44.971
You didn't tell <i>me</i>
you were pregnant.

18:45.005 --> 18:47.140
I didn't want you to marry me
because I was pregnant.

18:47.174 --> 18:49.409
I wanted you to marry me
because I was nagging you.

18:49.443 --> 18:50.977
(fusses)

18:51.011 --> 18:53.746
Um, he likes it if
you tickle his toes.

18:53.781 --> 18:55.548
Dude, he's my kid.
He likes what I like.

18:55.583 --> 18:57.250
But n-n-n-nurture.

18:57.284 --> 18:59.452
Gretch, I think
he's got my calves.

18:59.486 --> 19:01.254
He does, baby,
he does.

19:01.288 --> 19:03.590
Can I just say
good-bye to him quick?

19:03.624 --> 19:04.591
Sure.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.392
I guess this is it, little guy.

19:06.427 --> 19:07.357
Da-da.

19:07.382 --> 19:10.421
(gasps) The most beautiful
words a father can hear.

19:10.464 --> 19:13.499
Da-da. Da-da.
Oh.

19:13.534 --> 19:15.768
Hey, one day you'll have
kids of your own.

19:15.803 --> 19:16.812
I do.

19:16.837 --> 19:19.512
Really? Then this is
much creepier than I thought.

19:19.640 --> 19:20.974
Much.

19:22.409 --> 19:24.611
Shouldn't have bet his door
if he didn't want to lose it.

19:24.645 --> 19:26.613
(sighs)

19:33.120 --> 19:35.488
Hi, Maggie.
If you could talk,

19:35.522 --> 19:38.558
I know you'd have a few
choice words for me.

19:40.394 --> 19:43.763
You want me to take care
of your dolly?

19:43.797 --> 19:47.533
That's the sweetest thing
any baby has ever done for me.

19:49.000 --> 19:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:00.570 --> 20:02.203
Honey, you know where
the bottle opener is?

20:02.238 --> 20:03.738
I think it's
in the drawer.

20:05.174 --> 20:06.708
Whoa, little dude.

20:06.742 --> 20:07.943
