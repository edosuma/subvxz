WEBVTT

00:07.382 --> 00:08.550
Keep moving!

01:11.321 --> 01:12.155
Where is he?

01:13.531 --> 01:15.658
-Hey, hey, hey!

01:16.284 --> 01:18.620
-Where is Olaf?

01:19.204 --> 01:20.914
Where is Olaf?

01:20.997 --> 01:22.332
Taken!

01:23.541 --> 01:25.293
Taken by Forkbeard!

03:06.811 --> 03:08.396
My arrow struck first.

03:09.856 --> 03:10.857
You're cooking.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.028
Not so fast.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.491
My arrow struck the heart.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.579
You're not only cooking,
but you're carrying it.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.199
Let me change that dressing.

04:04.702 --> 04:06.120
It feels healed.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.456
I'll be the judge of that.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.805
Let me see it.

04:28.768 --> 04:29.769
Hmm.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.479
The wound is sealed.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.856
-Mmm-hmm.
-And the infection is gone.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.692
I told you.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.111
But it's not fully healed.

04:41.406 --> 04:45.410
But enough… for me to go to Kattegat.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.710
You wrap it up.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.462
Freydis.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.674
I cannot stay here forever.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.304
I must meet with Forkbeard
and demand what is mine.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.600
And you expect him
to just give you Norway?

05:11.894 --> 05:13.354
Canute swore an oath to me.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.356
Yes, but his father did not.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.652
Forkbeard did not bring an army
to Kattegat to protect your agreement.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.738
He will understand
when I explain it to him.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.239
He is hunting Olaf!

05:23.865 --> 05:25.950
What makes you think he's not hunting you?

05:28.119 --> 05:31.539
Besides, we know nothing
about the state of Kattegat now,

05:31.622 --> 05:32.790
or who is still alive.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.751
Which is all the more reason to return.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.212
I'm not frightened of Forkbeard.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.173
Perhaps you should be.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.393
And what would you rather do?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.646
Stay here in the wilderness?

05:56.898 --> 05:57.774
Yes.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.693
Or someplace new.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.988
What is wrong
with raising children in a place

06:04.072 --> 06:05.740
where they'll know peace instead of war?

06:05.823 --> 06:08.910
Because my children
are meant to be rulers of Norway,

06:08.993 --> 06:10.953
not hide in its wilderness!

06:11.037 --> 06:12.163
Your children?

06:17.710 --> 06:18.920
Our children.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.300
If we should be so blessed.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.346
Freydis…

06:30.181 --> 06:32.141
I must go back.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.434
You know this.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.438
And I want you to come with me.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.588
I know it is a risk
to go back, but I must.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.383
Olaf needs to pay for what he did.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.599
Come. Please.

07:14.809 --> 07:15.893
We must keep going.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.260
Mother!

07:53.097 --> 07:56.267
Welcome to Kattegat! Isn't it great?

07:57.894 --> 07:58.728
It's wonderful.

08:24.420 --> 08:28.674
-Death is too good for you.
-Come on, then, Your Highness. Go!

08:28.758 --> 08:30.510
That's what you are!

08:41.521 --> 08:43.022
Good morning, Your Highness.

08:43.105 --> 08:45.816
A ship arrived this morning
with news from Denmark.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.947
King Canute sends word. They've won
two great battles against the Wends.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.907
And any news on his return to England?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.700
Not at this time, Your Highness.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.037
He again expresses
his concerns about your security.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.711
I will write him a letter myself
to reassure him of my safety,

09:05.795 --> 09:07.964
and send it with you
on your outgoing tide.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.347
My husband
would not be worried about my security

09:16.430 --> 09:18.140
if you did not give him reason to.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.185
I give him reason to because
it's my job to safeguard your security

09:21.269 --> 09:23.563
and London's in his absence.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.067
I've heard things in the alehouses.

09:28.150 --> 09:31.445
I'm not concerned
about what you've heard in the alehouses.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.490
Our security is excellent.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.578
The huscarls would not allow
a threat inside these walls,

09:38.661 --> 09:41.122
and I will reassure Canute
of that in my letter.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.924
<i>Why do you leave?</i>

09:52.008 --> 09:54.844
The queen will not look for me
for another hour at least.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.681
Until Canute returns
and I obtain his blessing,

09:59.682 --> 10:02.518
we must keep these visits
a secret from the queen.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.104
If she found out about us,
she would send you away.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.565
I couldn't bear that.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.194
Do you truly worry
about the queen's safety?

10:13.404 --> 10:14.864
I worry about all our safety.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.284
The king is in Denmark,
Forkbeard's in Kattegat.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.787
-Threats are ever present.
-But from the alehouses.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.373
Surely, they're not credible.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.210
I take all threats as credible.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.593
When you have lost everything, as I have,

10:36.719 --> 10:39.096
you become accustomed
to preparing against the worst

10:39.180 --> 10:41.140
so as not to ever have it happen again.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.601
You must get used to that about me.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.061
It is who I am.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.234
That doesn't leave
much room for happiness.

10:53.694 --> 10:55.821
-What do you dream?
-Dream?

10:56.989 --> 10:59.492
Yes. Your hopes.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.869
When you close your eyes,

11:02.662 --> 11:05.373
what do you see of us 20 years from now?

11:10.878 --> 11:12.088
I see many children.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.342
And they would have your love,
which is pure.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.929
And they would grow up
without the fear that I did.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.057
When they're grown,
I'd scatter them round the country,

11:23.140 --> 11:25.810
each to their own kingdom,
where they would prosper.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.271
All, but the oldest.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.067
He'd be special.

11:33.693 --> 11:38.072
A great warrior, well-educated and wise.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.409
And one day…

11:45.788 --> 11:46.622
he'd be king.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.127
-King of England?
-Yes.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.880
Neither your family nor mine
are of royal blood.

11:56.882 --> 12:00.010
And, even if they were,

12:00.970 --> 12:03.055
the queen's two sons with Æthelred

12:03.139 --> 12:05.349
and Canute's own children

12:07.059 --> 12:08.811
would make that dream impossible.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.564
You asked me about my dream.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.818
When are dreams ever impossible?

12:37.298 --> 12:38.299
What did you see?

12:41.218 --> 12:42.219
I, uh…

12:43.846 --> 12:45.306
I thought I saw a wolf,

12:47.016 --> 12:48.601
but I was mistaken.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.935
Were you?

12:50.895 --> 12:55.232
Just because it isn't here,
does not mean you didn't see it.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.777
Did you feel threatened?

12:59.069 --> 13:00.196
No, just…

13:02.323 --> 13:04.658
startled, surprised.

13:04.742 --> 13:05.618
Good.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.787
Remember that.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.748
Why? What does it mean?

13:12.208 --> 13:16.420
The signs you so desperately
look for are everywhere, Freydis,

13:16.504 --> 13:19.757
if only you would trust
what you see and feel.

13:21.008 --> 13:25.137
I am tired
of these riddles about the future.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.639
You answer me nothing.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.225
This is a peaceful place,

13:29.308 --> 13:33.187
but the cries you run from have not ceased

13:33.270 --> 13:35.564
simply because you cannot hear them.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.801
Are you all right?

14:09.223 --> 14:10.432
What are you doing?

14:16.772 --> 14:18.357
I'm going to Kattegat with you.

14:49.638 --> 14:51.765
You've got a good seat for the show.

14:58.522 --> 15:02.484
They say Sweyn Forkbeard
is going to hang Olaf.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.363
Hanging, an English tradition.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.451
Should be the blood eagle. Hmm.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.995
Now that's a proper Viking execution.

15:15.915 --> 15:20.628
But then,
a lot of the old ways are disappearing.

15:22.046 --> 15:22.880
Go away.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.850
You're Leif Eriksson, no?

15:36.518 --> 15:37.519
Brother of Freydis.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.563
My name is Jorundr.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.316
Drink?

15:42.399 --> 15:43.317
No.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.455
Will your sister be here
for the execution?

15:56.538 --> 15:57.748
What do you care?

15:58.374 --> 16:01.919
There are still many who consider her
the last daughter of Uppsala.

16:02.002 --> 16:05.965
I would think she would want to make sure
the Christian tyrant, Olaf Haraldsson,

16:06.048 --> 16:07.633
gets what he deserves.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.970
He'll get what he deserves.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.906
There's nothing
I despise more than a traitor.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.454
And you, Olaf Haraldsson…

17:21.081 --> 17:22.332
you're a traitor.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.333
I'm not.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.629
Canute went behind my back

17:28.797 --> 17:32.259
and promised
what was rightfully mine to my brother!

17:32.342 --> 17:34.344
I was well within my rights.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.138
You have no rights.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.849
Norway was never yours to take, yet…

17:40.726 --> 17:42.478
you raised an army in secret.

17:44.313 --> 17:48.525
Conspired with others
to wrench it from my son's empire.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.280
I should kill you.

17:53.363 --> 17:57.284
Kill me! Kill me!

17:58.535 --> 18:00.621
Just spare me the lecture.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.958
Oh, but I don't intend to kill you.

18:05.751 --> 18:06.877
I have other plans.

18:09.713 --> 18:10.798
No! No!

18:21.850 --> 18:25.395
Canute is locked in a fight for Denmark
and I must join him.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.775
I'm installing my grandson, Svein,

18:31.276 --> 18:32.486
as King of Norway.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.154
Svein?

18:38.200 --> 18:41.703
He won't last a month
before the jarls kill him.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.872
Oh, no, no, no, no. No, they won't.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.960
Because you'll protect him.

18:48.043 --> 18:51.839
If you think I will be that boy's guardian

18:51.922 --> 18:54.967
just to save my life, you're a fool.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.885
I would… I would rather die.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.637
Yeah, I know you would.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.683
And that's why
it's not your own life you're saving.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.607
Father.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.777
Wait!

19:16.155 --> 19:16.989
Magnus!

19:30.419 --> 19:31.336
Here's my offer.

19:32.671 --> 19:37.009
Protect my grandson, guide him to be king,

19:37.092 --> 19:38.594
a Viking, a man,

19:39.178 --> 19:42.097
shield him against all enemies
as if he was your own blood,

19:44.433 --> 19:45.976
and I'll do the same with your son.

19:48.562 --> 19:49.730
If you do this,

19:50.772 --> 19:53.358
I promise that when time comes,

19:55.152 --> 19:56.486
the crown of Norway,

19:57.946 --> 19:59.698
though it'll never again be yours,

20:01.325 --> 20:02.367
will fall to him.

20:06.872 --> 20:07.706
But…

20:09.583 --> 20:13.837
if anything should happen to Svein…

20:23.013 --> 20:24.223
Do I have your word?

20:43.408 --> 20:44.243
Your Highness.

20:44.326 --> 20:48.288
-I did what I did--
-For your own insatiable greed!

20:48.372 --> 20:50.624
I was within my rights as a wife.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.210
You threatened my son's kingdom!

20:53.293 --> 20:56.046
But what's worse, you crossed me!

20:57.422 --> 20:59.007
I should have you killed.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.305
Instead…

21:09.059 --> 21:10.811
this will be your new home.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.981
Here? In Kattegat?

21:14.064 --> 21:18.277
Yes, here in Kattegat!
Why do you think I brought you here?

21:19.152 --> 21:21.154
To fetch my sons and return to Jelling.

21:21.738 --> 21:22.656
I've other plans.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.703
You have brought me
to the edge of the Earth!

21:28.829 --> 21:30.122
Aelfgifu!

21:30.205 --> 21:32.708
Be grateful you're still on this Earth!

21:35.627 --> 21:37.462
People of Kattegat!

21:38.088 --> 21:40.215
I've called you here to declare

21:40.299 --> 21:43.010
that my grandson, Svein Knutsson,

21:43.093 --> 21:45.762
will be the new King of Norway!

21:49.516 --> 21:51.935
And that his mother,

21:52.728 --> 21:54.730
Queen Aelfgifu of Denmark

21:54.813 --> 21:58.233
will remain here in Kattegat
as his regent.

21:59.401 --> 22:05.615
And to guarantee that Kattegat
remains secure and protected,

22:06.533 --> 22:10.954
I have placed Jarl Olaf Haraldsson,

22:11.038 --> 22:12.664
once an enemy,

22:12.748 --> 22:15.667
but now my friend,
as the king's protector.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.797
There will be no execution today.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.476
Thank you, King Forkbeard.

22:35.103 --> 22:35.937
Disappointed?

22:38.690 --> 22:40.817
Then we must change that.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.292
Friends!

22:57.876 --> 23:01.380
Kattegat is in danger from an old ally.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.466
My brother, Harald Sigurdsson,

23:05.967 --> 23:09.346
he believes
he is the rightful king of Norway

23:10.222 --> 23:12.808
and has convinced the heathen witch,

23:12.891 --> 23:15.936
Freydis Eriksdotter,
to support this quest.

23:16.019 --> 23:18.271
They are, at this moment,

23:18.355 --> 23:22.859
raising a great pagan army
to kill Christians,

23:22.943 --> 23:25.195
and march against Kattegat!

23:25.278 --> 23:27.989
But I will not let that happen!

23:28.073 --> 23:29.783
What will you do?

23:32.327 --> 23:35.414
This chest, and two more like it

23:35.497 --> 23:38.792
for the man or family
who brings me their heads!

24:08.363 --> 24:09.197
Hurry.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.828
Mother, it's her.

24:15.704 --> 24:16.580
She's the one.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.206
See?

24:19.082 --> 24:21.334
We need to go. Come now. Come.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.611
-Go down now.
-We're here for passage.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.820
Where are they going?

24:50.822 --> 24:54.159
-After you pay, you can go.
-Look! I told you it was her!

24:54.910 --> 24:56.244
You're her, aren't you?

24:59.789 --> 25:01.750
-Who?
-You're Freydis!

25:01.833 --> 25:03.668
The Keeper of the Faith, aren't you?

25:06.421 --> 25:08.006
I don't know who you mean.

25:08.089 --> 25:11.009
But I saw your shield test from Kattegat.

25:12.677 --> 25:13.887
I recognize your sword!

25:15.639 --> 25:17.766
You've come to help us, haven't you?

25:25.607 --> 25:26.733
No.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.362
I'm sorry, but you are mistaken.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.741
Come, we must hurry to the boats.

25:34.824 --> 25:35.825
Where are you going?

25:36.493 --> 25:39.746
Our village was destroyed by Kåre
before the fall of Kattegat.

25:40.622 --> 25:43.208
And now the Christian jarls
will not let us rebuild.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.002
We are going to find a new home.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.338
But those boats are not seaworthy.

25:48.421 --> 25:50.674
If there's a storm,
you'll drown in the open water.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.884
We've heard
there are ships waiting for us.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.094
To take you where?

25:54.594 --> 25:56.805
To a new Uppsala across the sea.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.015
A place called Jomsborg.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.643
-Three coins, pagan.
-We have to go.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.187
Quickly! You must leave now
or you'll miss the tide.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.105
Thank you.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.279
I got two more!

26:15.073 --> 26:16.950
On that boat. Get in.

27:14.382 --> 27:15.300
Amen.

27:19.429 --> 27:22.849
Don't touch the host, Your Highness.
It's poisoned. Guards, stop him!

27:27.687 --> 27:29.272
Stop him! Hold!

27:29.939 --> 27:31.232
-Stop that man!

27:31.316 --> 27:32.984
Stop him! Don't let him go!

27:36.196 --> 27:37.030
Get him!

27:37.614 --> 27:39.074
Go round!

27:39.157 --> 27:41.117
-Get him!
-Stop him!

27:52.295 --> 27:53.213
Stop him!

27:55.048 --> 27:56.049
Get him!

28:02.138 --> 28:03.014
This way!

28:03.598 --> 28:04.599
Where is he?

28:05.183 --> 28:06.017
Which way?

28:09.479 --> 28:10.689
Down there! Come on!

28:30.333 --> 28:31.543
Take him to the cells.

28:58.319 --> 28:59.237
I've seen them.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.073
Are you sure it is them?

29:02.657 --> 29:04.701
I fought with Prince Harald in London.

29:04.784 --> 29:05.910
I know him by sight,

29:05.994 --> 29:09.247
and the crowd around the woman
called her The Keeper of the Faith.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.750
Where are they?

29:11.833 --> 29:15.670
No. But I can take you there for a price.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.735
There was nothing
you could do to help them.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.739
I couldn't even admit who I am.

30:29.702 --> 30:32.080
They look to me for guidance, and instead…

30:35.250 --> 30:36.417
I give them doubt.

30:38.503 --> 30:41.422
And I'm supposed to be
The Keeper of the Faith.

30:48.596 --> 30:49.597
Someday…

30:51.975 --> 30:53.184
it won't be that way.

31:04.195 --> 31:05.446
Good luck, boy.

31:09.993 --> 31:10.869
One more.

31:10.952 --> 31:11.953
Time to go.

31:12.996 --> 31:13.955
Be good.

31:15.790 --> 31:17.000
Take your seat.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.092
Make your father proud.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.344
Make me proud.

31:28.428 --> 31:29.721
I will, Grandfather.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.225
Trust Jarl Olaf.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.979
He will protect you
until your father or I get back.

31:39.647 --> 31:40.690
I will.

31:40.773 --> 31:41.608
Good boy.

31:54.537 --> 31:55.788
I will honor my promise.

31:55.872 --> 31:56.915
As will I.

32:27.570 --> 32:28.821
Do you trust Olaf?

32:31.157 --> 32:32.825
I don't need to trust him.

32:33.576 --> 32:34.786
He needs to trust me.

32:37.330 --> 32:39.165
I should never have listened to you.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.044
It was your ambition
you listened to, not me.

32:45.588 --> 32:49.384
If you have any more ideas about power,
you keep them to yourself.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.928
You are a powerful woman here, Aelfgifu.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.556
You are a queen regent of a great land.

32:56.140 --> 32:58.768
Until my son and I
are murdered by its jarls.

32:59.352 --> 33:02.647
That will not happen.
I won't let it. Trust me.

33:02.730 --> 33:03.606
Trust you?

33:04.857 --> 33:07.110
No, never again.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.278
We'll see.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.284
Olaf!

33:16.202 --> 33:17.078
What is it?

33:17.662 --> 33:19.998
We have the location of Prince Harald.

33:20.081 --> 33:21.749
The bounty hunters are after him.

33:23.126 --> 33:26.045
All right.
Prepare to follow. Assemble the men.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.381
Well, Your Highness.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.593
You ready for your first lesson?

33:32.677 --> 33:33.636
Hmm.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.765
Good. I promise
it will be one you will not forget.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.673
-Go!

34:11.174 --> 34:12.300
Go!

35:04.018 --> 35:05.144
Leif!

35:05.728 --> 35:07.438
-What is this?
-They were coming for you.

35:08.022 --> 35:08.856
We need to move.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.316
Olaf is not far behind.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.903
Come. We need to get away from here.

35:14.737 --> 35:15.571
Let's go.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.660
Why were you returning to Kattegat?

35:22.078 --> 35:25.581
To see Forkbeard
and inform him of Canute's promise to me.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.001
It's too late for that.
Forkbeard has left Kattegat

35:29.085 --> 35:31.003
and named his grandson
the new King of Norway.

35:31.587 --> 35:34.382
Svein? Canute's son?

35:34.465 --> 35:37.510
Yes, and made Olaf his protector.

35:38.511 --> 35:41.722
Then why are we going this way?
I must go back and confront my brother!

35:41.806 --> 35:44.392
Harald, those men back there
were bounty hunters.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.061
Olaf has placed a price
on your head and Freydis'.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.691
Nowhere is safe for you now.
We must keep moving.

36:10.376 --> 36:12.837
Still warm! They haven't gone far.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.595
Two sets of tracks reach this point.

36:21.888 --> 36:25.641
Another joins them,
and they lead that way.

36:26.809 --> 36:28.352
They're heading for the coast.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.354
Let's go!

36:35.484 --> 36:36.319
Enter.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.115
Forgive me, Your Highness.

36:41.782 --> 36:44.035
I'm just checking
to see if you need anything.

36:44.118 --> 36:46.329
What have we learned
so far from the assassin?

36:47.079 --> 36:48.998
Very little, but we will.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.960
In the meantime,
I've posted additional huscarls

36:53.044 --> 36:54.670
at all doors to ensure you're all safe.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.715
Thank you, Earl Godwin.

36:57.798 --> 36:59.300
Yes, thank you.

37:01.093 --> 37:02.803
I'm sorry that I didn't trust you.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.432
My husband
will be in your debt when he returns.

37:08.100 --> 37:09.977
I'm still in his debt, Your Highness.

37:11.812 --> 37:12.980
Good night to you all.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.542
You have changed.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.297
-Nothing's changed.
-Yes, it has.

37:42.802 --> 37:44.220
There's a look in your eyes.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.222
A coldness.

37:47.765 --> 37:48.975
I've seen it before…

37:50.935 --> 37:54.522
with father, but… never with you.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.483
We go to Novgorod.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.613
-Novgorod? The Rus?
-Yes.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.158
My uncle Yaroslav is the ruler there.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.828
I'll explain to him
Forkbeard is an oath breaker.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.830
He will support my cause.

38:10.913 --> 38:12.581
Novgorod is a long journey.

38:12.665 --> 38:16.002
What other choice do we have?
A life on the run?

38:17.086 --> 38:20.548
If I have any chance
of taking what is rightfully mine,

38:20.631 --> 38:24.218
I must go to Novgorod
and raise my own army to fight Olaf.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.303
Leif Eriksson!

38:30.099 --> 38:31.684
Wait! I'm a friend!

38:34.478 --> 38:37.481
I know this man from Kattegat.
He asked questions about you.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.775
-What do you want with her?
-My name is Jorundr.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.777
-That's not what he asked!
-I am a Jomsviking.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.446
-What is that?
-Pirates.

38:43.529 --> 38:44.739
Ocean thieves.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.992
We're believers in the old ways.
Please, I'm here to help you,

38:48.075 --> 38:51.120
but if you wish to survive
you must all come with me, now.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.872
We're not going anywhere with you.

38:54.790 --> 38:55.708
What is this mark?

38:55.791 --> 38:57.918
The Skuld's Net. The Web of Fate.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.628
I have seen this mark before.

39:03.507 --> 39:05.468
I believe he is here for a reason.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.387
We know nothing about this man.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.599
Lead the way.

39:18.272 --> 39:21.025
Are all these people
believers in the old ways?

39:21.650 --> 39:25.279
Yes, refugees
from the purge by the Christians.

39:26.989 --> 39:30.451
-If Olaf finds us here, we're trapped!
-No, our boats will reach you first.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.037
Not in this fog.
No one sails in this weather.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.957
We do! We know the ways
of the fog and tides here.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.584
Wait for us.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.152
We cannot stay here.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.363
It is too dangerous.

40:07.446 --> 40:08.989
I will not leave these people.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.493
If this is where
I'm to make my last stand,

40:13.702 --> 40:14.703
then so be it.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.705
I will stand with you.

40:18.624 --> 40:19.625
Greenlanders.

40:21.961 --> 40:23.421
You don't make it easy.

40:27.133 --> 40:30.344
-Come. Let's get out of sight.
-We have to hide in here!

40:30.428 --> 40:32.555
-Quickly!
-Come, hurry!

40:33.305 --> 40:34.140
-Please!
-Hide.

40:47.695 --> 40:49.989
It will be fine.
It will be fine.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.639
I've seen you talk to someone.

41:18.976 --> 41:19.977
Is it Liv?

41:21.729 --> 41:22.563
Yes.

41:24.857 --> 41:26.108
That's what I thought.

41:29.528 --> 41:30.696
What does she tell you?

41:31.739 --> 41:33.782
She tells me to let go of my anger.

41:38.621 --> 41:43.209
-Yes, that sounds like her.

41:45.461 --> 41:49.173
Why is she here with you
and not in Valhalla?

41:50.591 --> 41:51.634
Because…

41:53.969 --> 41:58.724
when she was dying,
she asked me to promise to meet her there.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.019
And I couldn't.

42:06.732 --> 42:07.816
Why not?

42:09.235 --> 42:11.111
Because I no longer believe, Freydis.

42:25.125 --> 42:29.797
Perhaps it is not Liv
who will not let you go,

42:31.966 --> 42:34.760
but you who will not let her go.

42:36.178 --> 42:37.179
Hmm?

42:45.271 --> 42:46.355
Now…

42:48.399 --> 42:50.442
I have something to share with you.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.572
I'm with child.

42:57.950 --> 42:58.867
Does Harald know?

42:58.951 --> 42:59.785
No.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.455
And you must promise me…

43:05.583 --> 43:08.877
-You must promise me not to tell him.
-Why not?

43:08.961 --> 43:10.796
Because I cannot have a child

43:12.423 --> 43:15.342
that one day
would be the ruler of a Christian nation.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.387
And you think Harald would require it?

43:20.431 --> 43:21.265
No.

43:24.351 --> 43:25.769
Because I will not allow it.

43:43.370 --> 43:45.372
You are thinking about your brother.

43:47.666 --> 43:48.584
Half-brother.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.923
I don't know why I feel betrayed.

43:56.800 --> 43:57.968
I betrayed him.

44:00.929 --> 44:02.431
But it's just hard,

44:04.433 --> 44:05.976
leaving Norway like this.

44:08.312 --> 44:12.608
A destiny I've thought about all my life.

44:14.526 --> 44:18.906
You are leaving,
but you are not giving up.

44:18.989 --> 44:22.284
I know one day
you will be king of this country.

44:23.535 --> 44:25.120
It is your destiny.

44:39.551 --> 44:40.886
But it is not mine.

44:52.106 --> 44:52.940
Hmm.

44:58.070 --> 44:58.904
I know.

45:10.332 --> 45:12.334
Besides, I would not be a good queen.

45:15.295 --> 45:16.380
I disagree.

45:19.174 --> 45:20.759
You already are a great queen.

45:23.387 --> 45:26.014
I see it in your people's eyes
when they're with you.

45:29.643 --> 45:31.186
I don't understand why.

45:34.940 --> 45:35.774
I do.

45:41.029 --> 45:42.406
It is your gift.

46:05.220 --> 46:06.430
We have found them.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.688
Hyah! Hyah!

46:15.105 --> 46:19.026
-They're coming! They're coming!
-To the beach! Run! Go, go, go!

46:19.693 --> 46:21.612
-Go, go!
-Go straight!

46:22.279 --> 46:23.906
To the beach! Go straight! Fast! Go!

46:25.240 --> 46:26.325
Quickly! Quickly!

46:27.159 --> 46:30.329
Run! Run! Go! Go straight! Go straight!

46:31.872 --> 46:32.956
Keep going! Go!

46:33.874 --> 46:35.125
Nowhere to go!

46:37.085 --> 46:38.754
They are going nowhere!

46:55.020 --> 46:55.979
No mercy!

46:59.316 --> 47:01.443
Yeah!

47:23.966 --> 47:25.467
Kill them all!

47:55.581 --> 47:57.374
-To the boats!
-To the boats!

48:00.294 --> 48:03.380
Get in! Get in ! Go! Push!

48:03.463 --> 48:04.548
Push!

48:04.631 --> 48:06.258
No!

48:10.429 --> 48:12.055
Look at it burn!

48:52.804 --> 48:54.806
We have come for you, Freydis.

48:58.143 --> 49:00.520
Join us in Jomsborg.

49:04.524 --> 49:05.525
We made it.

49:34.012 --> 49:35.097
Goodbye, my brother.

49:36.264 --> 49:38.266
You will never be far from my heart.

49:39.434 --> 49:40.560
Or you mine.

50:20.767 --> 50:22.019
Novgorod is east.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.985
And I have no intention
of rowing the whole way there by myself.

50:30.068 --> 50:31.028
Why not?

50:32.446 --> 50:35.282
I thought Greenlanders
could row across any ocean.

50:35.365 --> 50:38.618
We can, but we prefer company.

50:54.885 --> 50:57.763
Come on. Put your back into it.
