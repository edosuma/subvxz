This is not fight club! This is a school.

Could you maybe run lines with me?

00:13.764 --> 00:15.578
Jesus didn't give me his pills.

00:15.610 --> 00:17.142
Mariana sold them to me.

Ok. I guess I'll start my homework.

So I have a doctor's

It's really up to her now.
She has to decide if she...

15:12.377 --> 15:15.179
- [All chattering]
- [Callie] Missed you. Hi!

15:15.213 --> 15:17.514
- Hi!
- Hi, beautiful.

15:17.549 --> 15:20.250
- I missed you.
- [Laughing]

15:20.285 --> 15:22.219
- Hey!
- Hi.

15:22.253 --> 15:26.390
- You look wonderful.
- Well, welcome, gang. Come on in.

15:26.424 --> 15:28.425
[Stef] Yeah!

15:36.301 --> 15:37.534
That's messed up they brought Brandon.

15:37.602 --> 15:41.371
Yeah, it's like bringin'
smack to a Becka party.

15:41.406 --> 15:44.508
- You ok?
- It's good. Jude's here, so...

15:44.542 --> 15:47.411
He's cute. Reminds me of my little cousin.

15:47.445 --> 15:49.379
He's a dumbass.

15:49.414 --> 15:52.316
You run out on him, he hugs you, and
takes you back like it's no biggie?

15:52.350 --> 15:54.484
Damn, Becka, be nice for once.

15:54.519 --> 15:58.422
Who is the hottie in the sweatshirt?

15:58.456 --> 16:01.525
- Jesus.
- You've been kissing the wrong brother.

16:01.559 --> 16:05.529
- He has a girlfriend.
- That has never stopped Gabi.

16:05.563 --> 16:08.599
- Brandon's way hotter.
- He's got a girlfriend too.

16:08.633 --> 16:14.204
Carmen, Brandon or Jesus?

16:14.239 --> 16:16.473
- I'm not interested in boys.
- Called it.

16:16.507 --> 16:19.276
- I like men.
- Ooh!

16:22.289 --> 16:23.765
So, what's it like?

16:23.766 --> 16:26.240
Do you have any beefs?
Are you on the bug juice?

16:26.241 --> 16:28.246
Who's got jigs for you if you
have to dance on the blacktop?

16:28.247 --> 16:32.079
Um, I actually have no idea
what any of that means, but, um,

16:32.080 --> 16:33.163
things here are ok.

16:34.054 --> 16:36.456
- Busy.
- Thanks.

16:36.490 --> 16:39.259
So, what do you guys do around here?

16:39.293 --> 16:42.228
Um, well, we get up at 5:45,

16:42.263 --> 16:46.065
and breakfast at 6:30, chores.

16:46.100 --> 16:49.369
We do all the cooking
and cleaning and so on.

16:49.403 --> 16:52.505
If we don't do it all right, we get extra.

16:52.540 --> 16:56.509
- Thanks.
- Then we have school,

16:56.544 --> 17:01.214
and homework, group, more
jobs. Then lights out at 9:15.

17:01.248 --> 17:05.117
Sounds like a system we should
try at home. What do you guys say?

17:06.186 --> 17:07.387
[Rita] Families?

17:07.421 --> 17:09.388
Would you please join
us in the dining room?

17:09.423 --> 17:12.157
The girls have prepared a late lunch.

17:16.096 --> 17:19.999
- Jesus?
- I'm good. Big breakfast.

17:20.034 --> 17:23.136
This all looks delicious, you guys.

17:23.170 --> 17:25.338
They make us go to cooking
classes after school.

17:25.372 --> 17:28.040
So Chinese, Italian, Indian.

17:28.075 --> 17:30.043
Hence the orange chicken and cornbread.

17:30.077 --> 17:34.214
- Will you teach me some of this when you come home?
- Sure.

17:48.195 --> 17:50.263
How is everything?

17:56.136 --> 18:00.406
- How's school?
- Fine.

18:00.441 --> 18:05.111
- Have you seen Connor lately?
- Yeah. At school.

18:05.145 --> 18:08.114
Right.

18:13.387 --> 18:15.054
Jude, I'm sorry.

18:17.224 --> 18:19.359
It's ok if you're angry.

18:19.393 --> 18:22.061
I'm not.

18:22.096 --> 18:23.396
Jude...

18:23.430 --> 18:24.998
It's just...

18:25.032 --> 18:28.134
you always push everybody away.

18:28.168 --> 18:31.037
I just never thought
that you'd do it to me.

18:32.506 --> 18:37.477
I wasn't. No, Jude, I
was trying to protect you.

18:39.446 --> 18:41.314
So you could get adopted.

18:43.183 --> 18:45.018
Well, I am.

18:45.052 --> 18:46.419
I am getting adopted.

18:46.453 --> 18:49.088
With or without you.

18:49.123 --> 18:52.225
Stef and Lena already
started the paperwork.

18:55.329 --> 18:58.998
[Laughs] That's... that's great.

18:59.033 --> 19:01.401
Wow! [Laughs]

19:03.103 --> 19:05.204
It's all working out.

19:17.484 --> 19:22.155
So you took out a restraining
order against your son.

19:22.189 --> 19:24.157
Want to explain why
he's sitting on my couch?

19:25.392 --> 19:28.428
He just wants things to
get back to normal, so...

19:28.462 --> 19:32.398
- Hm. And you trust him?
- We're actually not sure.

19:32.433 --> 19:35.001
We were hoping that today
would help to answer that.

19:35.035 --> 19:38.271
- Risky strategy.
- Brandon's our son.

19:38.305 --> 19:41.240
If we ever wanna be able
to bring Callie home,

19:41.275 --> 19:44.243
we're gonna have to deal
with it sooner or later, so...

19:44.278 --> 19:49.115
Mm. I think you might need to
have a conversation with Callie.

19:49.149 --> 19:51.417
She's applied for our
independent living program.

19:51.452 --> 19:54.320
She's trying to get her own apartment.

20:00.056 --> 20:02.395
So, what are you guys gonna
do when you get out of here?

20:02.763 --> 20:05.431
I'm getting my daughter back. First thing.

20:05.465 --> 20:09.568
I got a list. I'm gonna be a nurse,
or like a kindergarten teacher.

20:09.603 --> 20:11.837
I'm joining the army so
I can shoot a sweeper.

20:11.872 --> 20:16.842
- I may be an actress.
- I wanna be, like, a beautician

20:16.877 --> 20:20.813
and an archaeologist and a housewife.

20:20.847 --> 20:24.917
- And a mom.
- Oh, me too. I'm gonna be a mom.

20:24.951 --> 20:27.520
I hate kids.

20:29.923 --> 20:33.459
- You guys done with these?
- [All] Yeah.

20:48.709 --> 20:51.245
- [Sighs]
- Hey, um...

20:52.000 --> 20:54.880
What happened? Why are
you breaking up with me?

20:56.613 --> 20:59.582
- I'm not.
- Well... [laughs]

20:59.616 --> 21:03.786
What's up with the texts? "I
can't do this?" "It's over?"

21:03.820 --> 21:07.790
- I didn't write that.
- Well, someone did.

21:07.824 --> 21:10.826
I don't even have my
phone, somebody took it...

21:10.861 --> 21:14.797
I thought he threw it
out... I'm gonna kill him.

21:14.831 --> 21:17.700
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, it's ok.

21:17.734 --> 21:23.506
- I'm just happy you didn't...
- I didn't.

21:27.611 --> 21:31.681
- We're just talking.
- That's ok, talking is allowed.

21:35.552 --> 21:40.423
Uh, Callie, Rita was telling
us about independent living.

21:42.726 --> 21:44.660
I was going to tell you.

21:44.695 --> 21:49.465
So is that... that's
really what you want to do?

21:52.903 --> 21:55.738
Um, I want to thank you

21:55.772 --> 21:59.575
for everything that you've done for me.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.577
And for adopting Jude.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.782
I really feel like it's
time for me to be on my own.

22:09.653 --> 22:13.556
- Brandon, did you know about this?
- No.

22:19.730 --> 22:23.699
How is a 16-year-old girl
allowed to live on her own?

22:23.734 --> 22:27.837
- I don't know.
- How is she even allowed to make that choice so soon?

22:27.871 --> 22:30.439
Shouldn't there be some
sort of cooling off period

22:30.474 --> 22:34.510
before we let a teenage runaway
make a major life decision?

22:34.544 --> 22:38.481
It makes me sad too. She has
an entire lifetime to be alone.

22:38.515 --> 22:39.715
Why make things so hard on herself now?

22:39.750 --> 22:42.618
Do you think she's doing this
so she can be with Brandon?

22:42.652 --> 22:44.854
[Sighs] I hope not.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.657
[Sighs]

22:51.762 --> 22:55.598
[Sighs]

22:55.632 --> 22:58.768
- [Jesus] I'm busy!
- I need my homework.

22:58.802 --> 23:01.604
- [Jesus] Come back later!
- [Sighs]

23:23.427 --> 23:25.494
What's in the bag?

23:27.431 --> 23:30.633
Ok, I know you didn't throw my phone away.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.435
And I know you've been texting Brandon.

23:32.469 --> 23:34.670
- I was doing you a favor.
- I don't need favors.

23:34.704 --> 23:36.839
You can't have a boyfriend
while you're in here.

23:36.873 --> 23:39.809
You can't do drugs either.

23:39.843 --> 23:41.644
That's what's in your bag, right?

23:41.678 --> 23:44.513
Here's the deal.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.516
You give me the phone
back, I won't get Rita.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.618
It's not what you think.

23:52.756 --> 23:53.823
Wait.

24:24.785 --> 24:28.487
<i>- [Jesus] Respect the hat!
- I need my homework!</i>

24:31.592 --> 24:33.826
- Dude, the hat was on the door!
- Who are you talking to?

24:33.860 --> 24:35.661
- That's not Lexi.
- Shut up!

24:35.696 --> 24:37.563
<i>Hi. I'm Emma.</i>

24:37.598 --> 24:39.765
So you're telling me you just
locked me out without my book

24:39.800 --> 24:42.868
for over an hour so you could have
"Jesus time" with another girl?

24:42.903 --> 24:47.506
<i>Wait, what's "Jesus time?"
You on the computer with Lexi?</i>

24:47.541 --> 24:50.443
<i>- Oh! [Laughs]
- Emma, stop it.</i>

24:50.477 --> 24:52.545
<i>I hope you don't think you and
I were gonna have "Jesus time."</i>

24:52.579 --> 24:55.681
- No, it's not like that!
- Hey! It's my room too!

24:55.716 --> 24:58.484
- Well, too bad.
- You can't just write rules as you go!

24:58.518 --> 25:00.519
- You can't just lock me out!
- Jude!

25:00.554 --> 25:03.689
- Hey! What's going on here?
- He keeps putting his stupid hat on the door

25:03.724 --> 25:07.460
- so he can have "Jesus time."
- Wow.

25:07.494 --> 25:11.497
<i>- Is that true?
- I'm gonna go.</i>

25:11.531 --> 25:13.599
<i>Talk to you later, Jesus.</i>

25:13.634 --> 25:17.503
Jesus, be the big brother, please?

25:17.537 --> 25:19.705
We will be back to discuss
this. Jude, we need to talk.

25:21.675 --> 25:23.409
Come on.

25:29.816 --> 25:33.586
[Lena] You can't throw things at people,
that's not how we solve our problems here.

25:33.620 --> 25:36.216
- Jesus kicked me out of my room.
- And he shouldn't have done that.

25:36.217 --> 25:38.672
He's gonna hear about it. But
that's not an excuse, honey.

25:40.894 --> 25:45.564
- I'm sorry.
- Never again, bud.

25:51.872 --> 25:54.507
He called it his room.

25:54.541 --> 25:57.576
- His room.
- He threw something at Jesus, like a real little brother!

25:57.611 --> 26:01.614
- [Both squealing, laughing]
- Sh, sh!

26:02.649 --> 26:06.419
- [Laughing]
- Yay!

26:15.796 --> 26:18.831
- I'm not a drug addict.
- Ok.

26:18.865 --> 26:22.601
I'm serious. Those weren't "drug" drugs.

26:24.404 --> 26:26.539
They're hormones.

26:26.573 --> 26:30.776
I can't wait any longer
to be put in an LGBT home

26:30.811 --> 26:34.680
or to turn 18 so I can get
a doctor to prescribe them.

26:34.715 --> 26:37.450
What about your parents?

26:37.484 --> 26:41.420
Couldn't they sign off, or... give consent?

26:41.455 --> 26:44.623
Did you see any parents
there for me on family day?

26:44.658 --> 26:49.428
That's five in a row. They don't approve.

26:49.463 --> 26:52.565
They think me being a boy is
just code for me being a lesbian,

26:52.632 --> 26:55.768
which they're not cool with either.

26:55.802 --> 26:59.438
Told me to act like a girl, or get out.

27:03.710 --> 27:06.479
Lived on my own for ten months.

27:06.513 --> 27:10.649
Did what I had to do to survive,
and pay for the hormones.

27:11.818 --> 27:15.788
Got busted. Got sent
to juvie. Got sent here.

27:18.625 --> 27:22.361
I've been off them for
a few months, and my body

27:22.395 --> 27:26.499
is freaking out, reverting back to...

27:29.836 --> 27:32.805
Look...

27:32.839 --> 27:36.709
I need to use your
phone to call my hook-up,

27:36.743 --> 27:38.577
so I can get back on the hormones.

27:43.483 --> 27:48.788
The Brandon thing was
just... me being a jerk.

27:48.822 --> 27:51.524
I'm sorry.

27:51.558 --> 27:55.795
You may have noticed,
I've got some anger issues.

28:00.433 --> 28:04.703
- Are they safe? The hormones?
- Yeah.

28:04.738 --> 28:10.376
They're exactly what I would get
if I was allowed to see a doctor.

28:10.410 --> 28:14.613
Well, just tell me when you need to
use the phone and I'll give it to you.

28:14.648 --> 28:19.718
- But no more impersonating me.
- [Laughs] Deal.

28:30.430 --> 28:32.531
[Knocking]

28:43.610 --> 28:47.646
- Oh, hell no!
- We just need a few minutes.

28:47.681 --> 28:48.895
How'd you know she was here?

28:49.700 --> 28:51.729
You think you're going
to stay in here all alone

28:51.738 --> 28:54.520
with your biggest temptation? [Laughs]

28:54.554 --> 28:56.455
We're gonna hit up the 7-Eleven.

28:56.489 --> 28:59.391
- We need some more of those wipey things.
- We do?

28:59.426 --> 29:01.527
Fifteen minutes.

29:22.415 --> 29:25.584
- They're hardcore.
- Yeah. That's their job.

29:31.491 --> 29:33.826
I thought you must be missing this.

29:36.396 --> 29:37.529
Thanks.

29:39.833 --> 29:44.670
So this is, uh, independent living?

29:44.704 --> 29:49.375
- Pretty sweet deal.
- Well, it's not like they just give you an apartment.

29:49.409 --> 29:52.711
I have to do a lot of
stuff. Like counseling

29:52.746 --> 29:55.714
and special classes.

29:55.749 --> 29:58.617
But, yeah... um...

29:58.652 --> 30:04.423
Let me give you the tour.
That's the bedroom, bathroom,

30:04.457 --> 30:07.726
kitchen, living room.

30:07.761 --> 30:13.465
- It's spacious.
- This place is too white, though. I wanna paint mine.

30:13.500 --> 30:17.670
- Nice.
- Yeah, I've got, like, a couch,

30:17.704 --> 30:21.473
or a love seat, maybe a coffee table.

30:21.508 --> 30:25.544
And some posters or something.
Really make the place mine.

30:25.578 --> 30:27.446
Yeah.

30:29.516 --> 30:33.852
We could, um, put your keyboard over there.

30:33.887 --> 30:36.855
- My keyboard?
- Yeah.

30:39.859 --> 30:45.531
Yeah, we'll, um, we'll put a
50-inch LCD right over there.

30:45.565 --> 30:47.733
- Killer sound system.
- That costs too much.

30:47.767 --> 30:50.502
We need to get a nice kitchen table first.

30:50.537 --> 30:54.473
[Laughs] You want a nice
kitchen table over a TV?

30:54.507 --> 30:56.608
Where else are we gonna eat our breakfast?

30:56.643 --> 30:58.811
I do make some serious pancakes.

30:58.845 --> 31:01.380
Mm-hm.

31:03.483 --> 31:07.453
And I can serenade you, anytime you please.

What happened?

32:40.480 --> 32:42.448
Cole?

32:42.482 --> 32:45.451
Back away, ok? Give everybody some room.

32:45.485 --> 32:48.587
- Is he gonna be ok, sir?
- We're gonna find out soon.

32:48.621 --> 32:51.757
- What happened?
- Becka found Cole unconscious in the bathroom.

32:51.791 --> 32:54.660
- He OD'd.
- There were needles on the floor,

32:54.694 --> 32:59.731
and this next to it. Anyone
know anything about that?

33:01.501 --> 33:02.468
[Man] Ma'am?

33:10.577 --> 33:12.678
[Siren wailing]

33:13.150 --> 33:15.030
Ok, ladies. Listen up.

33:15.058 --> 33:19.095
The doctors are gonna be monitoring
Cole for the next couple of hours.

33:19.129 --> 33:22.660
He took a very large
dose of street hormones,

33:22.661 --> 33:23.881
and that caused a seizure.

33:23.967 --> 33:27.103
And when he fell, he hit his head.

33:29.139 --> 33:33.676
He told me they're just like
the kind a doctor would give him.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.879
Well, they may be. But they cause
a tremendous amount of side effects,

33:36.913 --> 33:39.115
which is why you have to
get them from a doctor.

33:39.149 --> 33:42.785
- You're his roommate.
- I didn't give him the drugs.

33:42.819 --> 33:44.653
And I'm not a narc.

33:44.688 --> 33:47.123
Yeah, but you're supposed to be
accountable for him. It's different.

33:47.157 --> 33:51.127
I'm sorry, ok?

33:53.063 --> 33:56.699
- I'm doing the best I can.
- No, you're not.

33:56.733 --> 33:58.901
You never say nothing in group.

33:58.935 --> 34:02.071

what you think we want to hear.

34:02.105 --> 34:05.708
You always asking us to cover for you.

34:05.742 --> 34:09.043
But we all know, all you care
about is getting out of here.

34:09.079 --> 34:12.047
So if you don't want to be here, then go.

34:12.081 --> 34:14.817
If you don't take this
seriously, you're screwing it up

34:14.851 --> 34:16.886
for the rest of us, and we need this.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.889
How am I screwing it up?
None of you want to be here.

34:20.924 --> 34:23.058
We're just here because the court made us.

34:23.092 --> 34:25.960
Yeah, but we ended up here because we
didn't have nobody to look out for us.

34:25.996 --> 34:29.764
- And you've got people.
- You've got your brother.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.967
You got a family that wants you.

34:33.003 --> 34:34.770
So, what're you doing here?

34:39.676 --> 34:42.745
Here's a four-door Sedan, $5,200.

34:42.779 --> 34:45.947
Air. CD player. Power windows.
Anchor points for a baby seat.

34:45.996 --> 34:48.666
[Laughs] Thank God
those days are behind us.

34:50.034 --> 34:53.536
Yeah, but it's 12 years
old and no warranty.

34:53.572 --> 34:56.639
If it breaks down, we're right back
in the same exact position we are now.

34:56.675 --> 34:58.709
Minus $5,200.

34:58.744 --> 35:01.579
Here's a minivan.

35:01.613 --> 35:04.715
Uh, 2009, a little above our price range.

35:04.750 --> 35:08.519
Not to mention it violates our
sacred oath never to drive a minivan.

35:09.721 --> 35:12.823
Or we could always accept Frank's gift.

35:14.025 --> 35:15.626
No.

35:15.660 --> 35:16.927
I'm not saying we should.

35:16.962 --> 35:18.629
- I'm just saying we could...
- No.

35:18.663 --> 35:21.766
- ... revisit?
- Lena, it's like he's saying,

35:21.800 --> 35:25.002
"I can't support your marriage
because I'm a bad father,

35:25.036 --> 35:28.706
but here's a new car to make up
for my ignorance and intolerance."

35:28.740 --> 35:31.942
By taking the car, we're
saying it's ok. And it's not ok.

35:31.977 --> 35:35.613
It's not, but intolerance works both ways.

35:37.983 --> 35:40.985
I'm sorry, exactly how am I intolerant?

35:41.019 --> 35:43.621
You're not, to me.

35:43.655 --> 35:45.756
But we're operating under the assumption
that we're right and he's wrong.

35:45.791 --> 35:47.792
- He is wrong.
- Yes, of course he's wrong.

35:47.826 --> 35:49.760
But in his perspective,
he's right and we're wrong.

35:49.795 --> 35:51.829
So maybe he's just
trying to meet us halfway

35:51.863 --> 35:54.498
because he loves you
and he loves our family

35:54.533 --> 35:55.833
and he wants to keep
that relationship with us.

35:55.867 --> 35:58.969
No. My dad sees a problem, he
writes a check, boom, problem solved.

35:59.004 --> 36:01.672
Maybe this isn't a payoff. Maybe
this is just a nice gesture?

36:01.706 --> 36:04.708
Know what would have been a better
gesture? Coming to the wedding.

36:04.743 --> 36:07.912
In all fairness, you asked him not
to come unless he changed his beliefs.

36:07.946 --> 36:10.748
Yes, his bigoted beliefs!

36:10.782 --> 36:13.951
It'd be like if he invited us to dinner,
but only if we registered republican first.

36:13.985 --> 36:16.720
Wow, you must really want this car.

36:16.755 --> 36:20.891
Oh, God! That is not fair. This
has nothing to do with the car.

36:20.926 --> 36:23.828
I'm just thinking that
this is a real opportunity

36:23.862 --> 36:25.863
for you to talk things out with him.

36:25.897 --> 36:30.801
I've been down this road
with him so many times, Lena.

36:30.836 --> 36:33.904
- And you know that.
- Stef.

36:33.939 --> 36:37.608
- Stef.

you on pre-natal vitamins?

37:11.943 --> 37:13.777
Yes.

you know. You don't commit.

- That's not fair.

37:30.629 --> 37:33.931
Of course it isn't.
But that's how it works.

37:48.747 --> 37:51.882

37:51.917 --> 37:55.886
My first husband, sweetest guy, Jeff.

37:55.921 --> 37:58.889
Let me guess, something
terrible happened to him

37:58.924 --> 38:02.626
and you've never forgiven yourself.

38:02.661 --> 38:04.528
I cheated on him.

38:05.797 --> 38:07.798
I was so insecure.

38:07.832 --> 38:10.601
I didn't think I was smart
enough or funny enough

38:10.635 --> 38:13.971
or thin enough for him
to ever really love me.

38:14.005 --> 38:16.674
I never felt safe.

38:16.708 --> 38:20.711
I couldn't ever trust,
so I couldn't ever commit,

38:20.745 --> 38:23.123
I was so sure everything
was gonna be taken from me,

38:23.124 --> 38:24.812
that I took it away from myself.

38:27.752 --> 38:31.522
I don't really know why, Callie,
but you do the same exact thing.

38:31.556 --> 38:33.958
Always with one foot out the door,

38:33.992 --> 38:36.560
never taking the time to really connect.

38:36.595 --> 38:38.862
I think it's 'cause you're scared.

38:38.897 --> 38:41.832
I'm not scared, I'm sick of it.

38:41.866 --> 38:44.568
- I just want to be on my own.
- You do?

38:44.603 --> 38:46.737
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
- Really? Yeah.

38:46.771 --> 38:48.639
Because you think it's safer that way?

38:48.673 --> 38:50.975
Ok, Rita, I get it. You want
me to go back to the Fosters.

38:51.009 --> 38:55.813
I'm not you, ok? That's not what I want.

38:55.847 --> 38:57.681

make choices for you.

making decisions the way you've been,

you're gonna ruin every good

No matter what it is, no
matter how great it is,
