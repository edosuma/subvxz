Yes, boy! What you gonna do with

Give me my money. You still owe me.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.647
Hey, everyone,

02:27.731 --> 02:30.483
As you know,

02:32.194 --> 02:33.694
Now, I'll tell you this...

02:33.821 --> 02:35.738

02:38.534 --> 02:39.826
Come on, now.

02:39.910 --> 02:43.329
Listen. I just want you to know,
I just stayed ahead of you...

02:43.413 --> 02:46.040
because I know you
enjoyed the view.

02:46.917 --> 02:47.917
The view.

02:48.001 --> 02:52.338
Anyway, we're all real proud of you
for finally getting your taxi license.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.217
Knowing you're behind the wheel
in a taxi in our fair city...

02:56.301 --> 02:57.844
makes us wanna move to Albany.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.598
I seen these sparkling in a window,
I knew they had your name on it.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.518
I thought it'd be perfect for you.
Check it out. You'll love it.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.937
- Oh, wow.
- This is you, girl.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.233
Oh, my God.

03:12.985 --> 03:17.196
It's a titanium supercharger!
Oh, my God!

03:17.281 --> 03:18.573
That's gonna be some taxi, Belle.

03:18.657 --> 03:21.325
- It's just my size too!
- That's right, baby.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.453
- Please don't leave.
- I don't wanna go.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.956
Time's up, man.
Get your hands off my girl.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.166
- Get off me, man.
- Hey, baby.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.587
Whoo!

03:33.171 --> 03:36.465
- Shut up.
- All right, back to work!

03:36.550 --> 03:39.677
I gotta get the package there
with a horse and buggy.

03:39.761 --> 03:43.347
- What you doing here?
- I took the rest of the day off.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.182
- All right.
- Wait a minute.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.314
- Wait, who you wearing perfume for?
- What?

03:51.815 --> 03:54.775
Oh, no, no. I cut through Macy's.
I got tagged.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.403
Why, you like it? Is it me?

03:57.529 --> 04:01.324
Let me tell you something.
There's only one thing I like on you.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.701
- What's that?
- And that's me.

04:05.787 --> 04:07.914
I got you a little something too.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.708
- What?
- Hold on. You'll find out tonight.

04:11.001 --> 04:14.545
After our mind-blowing
romantic dinner, date...

04:16.548 --> 04:18.173
and et cetera.

04:18.884 --> 04:22.511
- Oh, hell, no. Don't tell me you forgot.
- No. Of course not.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.264
- I can't wait, baby.
- I know I may not be as exciting...

04:25.349 --> 04:27.767
- As that titanium thing.
- You saw it?

04:27.851 --> 04:30.061
Whatever, baby. Just trust me.

04:30.187 --> 04:34.273
I just got a 4:00 appointment at the
Taxi Commission to pick up my license.

04:34.358 --> 04:37.526
I'll be out of there by 4:30.
Then I'm all yours.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.780
B.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.116
4:00 was five minutes ago.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.244
Oh, shoot! I love you, baby!
Later, guys!

04:49.581 --> 04:52.083
- Hey, lady, come on!
- I got an appointment.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.960
No, no, no. No cut.

04:54.044 --> 04:57.296
- I got an appointment.
- Everybody here with appointment.

04:57.381 --> 05:01.258
We take number like bakery.
Go to the back, do not come here.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.180
Right here. Ticket.
Right there, take it.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.393
Hundred thirty-eight?

05:26.910 --> 05:27.994
Man.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.414
Oh, he bought candles.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.130
I'll make it up to you, baby.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.743
Hey! What the hell is your problem?

06:50.827 --> 06:54.080
- Come on, let's go.
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

06:54.164 --> 06:57.792
Cabby, I need to get to JFK
in 15 minutes.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.503
One hundred bucks, I make it.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.670
Whoo.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.339
Done.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.346
You jumped in the right cab today.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.683
Oh, yeah.

07:19.356 --> 07:23.859
I don't usually stop for white guys.
My way of balancing the universe.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.543
That's 14 minutes.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.131
Buckle up for safety, mother...

08:16.413 --> 08:19.748
If I miss this flight,
it wouldn't be the end of the world.

08:19.833 --> 08:23.919
No, don't worry. We'll be able to
speed up once we hit the highway.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.268
Come on, man, what'd I do?

08:40.437 --> 08:43.397
Hey, look here, Hugo Boss,
you might wanna hold on.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.815
Nine minutes, 28 seconds.
Damn, I'm good!

09:27.359 --> 09:29.109
You know... Damn.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.992
I'm good. I am good.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.015
Don't you scratch them, you idiot.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.864
- Frank, man, where's your friend at?
- He'll be here.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.533
It's all right.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.107
Where's this guy, man?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.151
He'll be here.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.405
This is the guy?

11:01.953 --> 11:03.579
Yeah, that's him.

11:05.081 --> 11:06.790
Let's do this.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.627
- It's cool, right?
- Right. It's cool.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.087
Come on.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.099
They're in.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.310
You know the drill, Frankie.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.480
We're going to the fifth floor.
Number 22, okay?

11:33.651 --> 11:35.361
And don't try nothing.

11:35.945 --> 11:40.783
This is an easy bust, Washburn.
Don't do anything fancy. We clear?

11:41.326 --> 11:43.744
Yeah. Nothing fancy, that's cool.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.330
Stick to the plan.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.330
It's okay. It's good.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.332
Got the money?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.713
No, no. Wait, wait.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.092
I don't like it. I thought you said
these guys are from Cuba, like us.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.512
- What's the matter?
- I'm not speaking to you.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.307
- You not from Cuba, okay?
- No, no, no. Forget it. Forget it, okay?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.601
You know what? I don't like this. No.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.603
- You don't like it.
- I don't like it.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.814
Okay, man? I don't like it!

12:54.315 --> 12:57.025
- You don't like it?
- You no speak English?

12:57.110 --> 13:00.863
I don't like it. Read my lips.
I smell something. What do I smell?

13:00.947 --> 13:02.573
What do I smell?

13:02.657 --> 13:04.950
I smell a setup.
What am I smelling here?

13:05.034 --> 13:08.662
What do I smell? Pig! Okay, man?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.539
- Don't do this.
- Okay?

13:11.040 --> 13:14.960
You telling me that you don't trust me?
That's what you saying?

13:16.546 --> 13:18.672
I'm only gonna say this once, okay?

13:18.756 --> 13:22.301
Your friend better come out
from behind that door. Okay?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.762
Or I'm gonna put a window in him.

13:27.891 --> 13:28.932
Man.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.503
Okay?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.004
He okay, man. You're okay.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.215
What part of Cuba you from?

14:02.091 --> 14:03.759
- Havana.
- Havana?

14:05.553 --> 14:07.804
- We from Havana.
- Cigar!

14:08.181 --> 14:09.598
I love this guy.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.016
The three of us are the same.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.936
We must be brothers, eh?
Who's your mother?

14:14.604 --> 14:17.314
I tell you something right now.
You guys are ever in...

14:17.398 --> 14:20.067
- Let's go.
- You ever in Havana, give me a call.

14:20.151 --> 14:24.029
We'll have tequila, cerveza, okay?
Mi Costco es su Costco.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.367
He funny.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.455
What part? What part?

14:33.540 --> 14:36.625
You ask me where I'm from?
What part am I from?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.170
- What part of Havana?
- Yeah.

14:40.255 --> 14:46.301
You know, I live over on the corner
of Castro Street.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.679
You know?

14:49.472 --> 14:50.639
So...

14:54.185 --> 14:55.769
The show's over, pigs!

14:59.649 --> 15:01.817
- You all right?
- Goddamn it, Washburn!

15:05.655 --> 15:08.574
How could there not be
a Castro Street in Cuba?

15:08.658 --> 15:10.367
- Shut up, Washburn.
- Am I right?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.834
Hey, stop! They're getting away!

15:19.377 --> 15:20.544
Come on, let's go.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.754
You can't drive like that.
Give me the keys.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.173
- Come on, come on!
- No, I insist.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.050
Give me the keys!

15:27.135 --> 15:28.218
Okay.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.432
- Be careful.
- All right, I'll be careful.

15:33.516 --> 15:35.517
Put my seat belt on.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.353
Okay, my hands at 10 and 2.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.440
- Okay, I'll just move the seat up...
- Okay. Okay.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.109
Like that. Too close. Back more.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.528
Back more, back more, back.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.239
Little back. Back.

15:49.866 --> 15:53.201
That's good. All right, mirror's checked.
I can see back.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.704
Washburn, maybe...

15:56.414 --> 16:00.584
I got it! I got it, man! Hand signal
because I'm coming out. Coming out!

16:00.668 --> 16:04.504
- There! Go! Go!
- Here we go! Rock 'n' roll, dude! Yeah!

16:04.589 --> 16:06.048
Washburn!

16:43.544 --> 16:44.544
That's funny.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.092
Get in here now.

16:54.514 --> 16:55.806
I'm sorry, Marta.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.308
Lieutenant. I'm sorry, lieutenant.

16:58.685 --> 17:03.522
Andy, I know this is hard for you,
especially coming from me.

17:03.981 --> 17:08.026
- Feels weird calling you lieutenant.
- You may not have to much longer.

17:08.111 --> 17:12.906
I mean, look at this.
There's $40,000 in damages, Andy.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.159
This is two lawsuits here. And this.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.994
Your face on the cover.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.289
- There's a better picture than that.
- Shut up.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.584
I'm sorry, Andy,
but this is just not easy for me.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.878
Look, you're a good cop...

17:27.964 --> 17:30.382
you're a terrible driver.
What is it with you?

17:30.466 --> 17:34.302
Everyone has their weaknesses, okay?
Superman has kryptonite.

17:34.846 --> 17:38.849
Indiana Jones, snakes. You know,
Whitney Houston has Bobby Brown.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.393
Or vice versa.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.688
I try to make the department look good,
make you look good.

17:44.772 --> 17:48.900
You look great, by the way. I'm not
saying you don't. You're not like:

17:48.985 --> 17:51.319
- You know, you look...
- Okay. Enough.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.904
You look like a lieutenant.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.531
Beautiful. Hot.

17:55.116 --> 17:57.701
- Professional.
- Three cars you totaled.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.620
Cop or no cop, that is 11 points
on your license. It's gone.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.706
- Don't take my license.
- Gone.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.499
Come on, don't do...

18:05.668 --> 18:08.879
You're not gonna need it
for your next assignment.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.645
Sorry, babe, but that line
at the TLC was ridiculous.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.023
- I cooked for hours.
- Come on. Look, all right.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.442
Wine, satin sheets, even candles.

18:30.526 --> 18:34.112
You realize what I went through
to get that license? I won't be late.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.490
Well, you better not be,
because today...

18:36.574 --> 18:41.244
- I pulled out all the stops.
- Baby, I promise I won't, for real.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.996
Five o'clock, at the restaurant.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.875
All units, all units, robbery in progress.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.252
Manhattan Savings and Loan,
36th and Broadway.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.546
Suspects armed and dangerous.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.718
Freeze! Police officer!
I'm gonna need your car for official...

19:18.241 --> 19:20.033
I love you too. Bye.

19:20.618 --> 19:24.454
Hi, 36th and Broadway, Manhattan
Savings and Loan. Step on it.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.874
- That's only two blocks up...
- Step on it! Thank you.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.084
Okay.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.687
Okay, that'll be $2.30.

19:48.771 --> 19:50.939
Hey, I'm on a beat, man!

19:52.692 --> 19:55.193
- Now you owe me 5...
- Get out of the way!

19:55.278 --> 19:56.403
Freeze!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.740
- You! We got a hot pursuit. Go!
- Do what?

20:00.825 --> 20:03.618
- You owe me 5 bucks!
- Maybe I wasn't clear.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.995
I'm commandeering your vehicle.

20:05.079 --> 20:08.957
Follow that car. Don't worry
about speed limit, lights, nothing.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.417
Oh, man.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.046
All right, but I'm still
running this meter.

20:30.938 --> 20:33.440
Here we go. Hold this for me.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.401
Hang on.

21:32.833 --> 21:35.293
Yo, man, be careful with that!

21:35.378 --> 21:36.378
Careful don't bag the bad guys.

21:36.462 --> 21:40.298
Fake left, go right.
I'll lay suppressing fire...

21:40.383 --> 21:42.842
down from my "pistolita" here...

21:46.222 --> 21:49.224
- My goodness. Did you just...?
- Drive! Drive the car!

21:49.308 --> 21:50.725
Don't look at me, look at the road.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.199
Come on.

22:09.870 --> 22:11.037
What the...? Oh, come on, now.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.628
- Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?

22:18.713 --> 22:20.380
Can't... Gotta get it.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.591
Watch it. You...
The steering wheel.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.322
What the hell?

22:49.618 --> 22:52.579
- Why'd you stop for?
- Hey, man, watch that thing!

22:52.663 --> 22:54.622
Dead end. They ain't going nowhere.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.042
Let's do this, baby.
Get my burn on.

22:57.126 --> 23:01.171
You talking to me or the gun? You
better not be talking to me.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.925
There's nowhere to run!

23:10.556 --> 23:11.681
Damn.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.153
Damn.

23:54.058 --> 23:56.559
- Damn!
- I know, they got away. Damn!

23:56.852 --> 23:59.562
- You shot my taxi!
- You calm down now, ma'am!

23:59.647 --> 24:03.483
- Calm down. No need to get upset.
- No need to get upset? What?

24:03.943 --> 24:07.862
You out of your mind? I've been
working on this car for five years.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.782
- Who is gonna pay for that?
- Hey! See this?

24:10.950 --> 24:15.203
This is a badge, okay? That means
you're not allowed to scream at me.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.207
Come on, now, give me the badge.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.714
Come on, give it back. Come on, now.
Give me that. Give it!

24:27.550 --> 24:29.509
Hand it over, cabby!
Nice and easy!

24:29.593 --> 24:31.302
All right. Damn, be cool.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.639
Be cool? I had to flip and pull this
out of my ankle holster.

24:34.723 --> 24:38.059
- Now, give me that and shush!
- Okay. Be cool.

24:38.561 --> 24:42.230
- All right. Here, take your badge, man.
- All right.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.733
Yeah. Okay, now what?

24:46.318 --> 24:47.652
How you like it being pointed at you?

24:50.906 --> 24:55.034
- Quick, give me, give me...
- Drop your weapon! Hands in the air!

24:57.246 --> 24:59.664
- Freeze!
- It's okay, I'm a police officer!

24:59.748 --> 25:02.083
Okay, slowly show me your badge.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.794
- Okay. Give me the badge.
- No.

25:04.879 --> 25:06.379
- Give me the badge.
- No!

25:06.463 --> 25:08.214
Throw it over here.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.761
I can't.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.639
She's got it.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.516
- Freeze!
- Wait, wait, wait!

25:18.601 --> 25:20.185
I said, freeze...

25:20.978 --> 25:23.438
Washburn. Washburn.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.024
He's such a loser.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.738
Is he in there?

25:31.822 --> 25:33.114
Washburn!

25:35.034 --> 25:36.409
Washburn...

25:36.994 --> 25:39.537
you took a cab to a bank robbery?

25:40.456 --> 25:43.666
- You thought that was okay?
- Well, yeah. Yeah.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.044
I was the closest to the scene.

25:46.128 --> 25:49.172
- If you hadn't taken my wheels...
- I didn't take them.

25:49.256 --> 25:53.676
You drove through a bodega.
You killed Detective Manuel's parrot.

25:53.761 --> 25:57.722
Manuel knew what he was risking
with the parrot on the stakeout.

25:58.349 --> 25:59.641
- I can't believe you.
- So ridiculous.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.769
Of all pets, I mean,
it's the one that talks.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.189
What is that smell?

26:06.273 --> 26:08.524
- I know, I let you down.
- Mm-hm.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.776
So see what's happening?

26:09.860 --> 26:13.905
You're getting emotional,
and you're taking it way too personally.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.657
- Personally?
- Yeah.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.451
I'm your lieutenant!
Of course I'm pissed.

26:18.535 --> 26:23.122
Come on, Marta. You know what I'm
talking about here. I'm talking about us.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.167
- Us.
- What?

26:27.294 --> 26:28.920
Us. Talking about us.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.258
- You think that I... And you...
- I got it.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.677
Got that. I'm with you.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.345
What?

26:37.805 --> 26:38.972
Mm-hm.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.558
Okay, thank you. I'll be right there.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.479
The FBI's here.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.025
I'm gonna do something to you later.

26:56.699 --> 26:57.949
Washburn!

27:07.668 --> 27:12.505
So did you pay by the mile, or is there
a flat rate for chasing bank robbers?

27:12.589 --> 27:14.716
Quiet. Quiet.

27:15.551 --> 27:20.722
Please give your attention to Agent
Mullins, FBI Armed Robbery Unit.

27:22.016 --> 27:23.391
Thank you.

27:23.475 --> 27:28.062
This is tape of this morning's robbery.
Watch close. It goes by pretty fast.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.987
Four cameras, four perfect shots.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.574
In and out in 35 seconds. Lieutenant,
you have the witnesses' statements.

27:40.868 --> 27:44.996
Miss Williams, I'm Lieutenant Robbins.
This is Agent Mullins, with the FBI.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.666
- We wanna ask you a few questions.
- Am I under arrest?

27:48.751 --> 27:51.502
- Well, no.
- Then I ain't answering no questions...

27:51.587 --> 27:53.880
until somebody tells me
who's paying...

27:53.964 --> 27:56.090
for my cab
and when do I get it back.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.509
Your vehicle is physical evidence now.

27:58.594 --> 28:02.180
- We have to run ballistics tests.
- Ballistics tests? On what?

28:02.264 --> 28:04.474
We already know who shot my cab!

28:04.558 --> 28:07.810
It was that idiot there
with that dumb look on his face.

28:07.895 --> 28:11.898
- That's not fair. He wasn't on the scene.
- I'm talking about you.

28:12.274 --> 28:15.068
- Me?
- Shot my window out, could've shot me!

28:15.152 --> 28:18.154
- Don't talk to me like that!
- I'll talk how I want.

28:18.238 --> 28:20.740
- Get him out.
- Take his stinking ass out of here.

28:20.824 --> 28:24.494
- All right, all right. I'm sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

28:24.578 --> 28:27.663
That is the FBI in there.
You need to calm down.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.874
Somebody better talk to him.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.126
Sorry about that, dude. Sir.

28:32.211 --> 28:35.630
The adrenaline's still pumping.
Had a crazy morning.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.673
I'm a little out of line, and I apologize.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.676
You were the first one
on the scene, correct?

28:40.844 --> 28:43.137
Yes. I was the first one on the scene.

28:43.222 --> 28:47.475
My first instinct is to give you a shot
at leading this investigation.

28:49.103 --> 28:52.814
However, I spoke with your lieutenant.
You're off the case.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.317
- Permanently.
- What?

28:56.819 --> 28:58.486
Nice meeting you.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.572
I know.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.001
- Marta, you can't... Lieutenant, you...
- Enough.

29:14.086 --> 29:17.004
Now, go clock in.
You're late for your shift.

29:22.678 --> 29:25.346
I already told you everything I know.

29:26.014 --> 29:29.559
You can't hold me.
Now, I want my cab.

29:31.019 --> 29:33.521
- Says you did a year in juvenile hall.
- That's sealed.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.858
Joyriding.
Graduated to reckless driving...

29:37.526 --> 29:41.612
fleeing the scene of an accident.
Moving violation, moving violation...

29:41.697 --> 29:44.740
- Come on, everybody got a few tickets.
- Not 75.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.870
And not on a bicycle, Miss Williams.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.498
Officers at the front will give you
the forms you need.

29:52.583 --> 29:56.127
You'll get your car back
when we're done with it. Two weeks.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.297
Two weeks?
Come on, man, this is bullshit!

29:59.590 --> 30:02.300
That's not just my car, that is my job!

30:02.426 --> 30:06.429
What am I supposed to do? Give
piggyback rides to Newark Airport?

30:07.473 --> 30:09.140
One more question:

30:10.225 --> 30:14.020
Did you ever get close enough
to see the guy driving the car?

30:14.646 --> 30:16.063
No, sir.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.735
All I saw was their taillights.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.906
Can I go now?

30:25.574 --> 30:28.993
Didn't I say
5:00? Where the hell are you?

30:29.328 --> 30:32.079
I'm a fool,
thinking you'd be here on time.

30:32.331 --> 30:34.457
- I tried.
- No, no, no.

30:34.541 --> 30:37.710
- I'm tired of hearing excuses, okay?
- I'm sitting in my cab, right?

30:37.794 --> 30:41.964
All of a sudden, out of nowhere,
this guy jumps... Hello? Baby.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.091
Jesse.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.054
What the hell could be
so damn important?

30:57.606 --> 31:00.608
- After the freaking day I had.
- Hey, Miss Williams.

31:00.692 --> 31:03.444
- Miss Williams. Hey, hey!
- You again!

31:03.529 --> 31:07.532
- Go ahead, talk.
- I just wanna talk. I can get your cab.

31:09.451 --> 31:13.496
Come on.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.415
You gotta help me first.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.835
Okay, just hear me out.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.715
Five detectives on this case.
We gotta catch these guys first.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.053
All I got to go on is the M.O., modus
operandi. That's police jargon for...

31:29.137 --> 31:32.932
I know what it means.
And it's not police jargon. It's Latin.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.976
Whatever. It's both.

31:35.269 --> 31:38.896
They were pretty quick.
In and out in under a minute. Real pros.

31:38.981 --> 31:41.274
Witnesses said they're
Spanish or Italian.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.734
Brazilian.
They were speaking Portuguese.

31:43.819 --> 31:44.860
You sure?

31:44.945 --> 31:49.407
My first job was delivering
food at Gauchos de Newark.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.868
Brazilian. This is huge.

31:53.745 --> 31:56.205
Why are we not
doing this at the station?

31:56.290 --> 31:59.709
A good cop has gotta bend the rules
so that laws don't get broken.

31:59.793 --> 32:03.462
Know what I'm saying?
I'm not afraid to live outside the law.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.591
You're living outside of your mind,
that's where you live.

32:06.675 --> 32:09.427
Reports here say
that the man driving is 5'10".

32:09.511 --> 32:13.973
Nope. No, no, no.
If that was a man, so am I.

32:14.558 --> 32:18.144
She looked like a model.
Tan, blondish hair.

32:18.228 --> 32:21.230
All right, as I was saying,
it was a woman driving...

32:21.315 --> 32:24.317
and she was driving a Mercedes...

32:24.693 --> 32:28.029
- An Aud...
- No. No, no.

32:28.488 --> 32:33.117
She was driving...
Definitely, you saw her driving a BMW?

32:33.660 --> 32:34.827
Right.

32:36.038 --> 32:38.706
Yeah, but not just a BMW,
it was a 760.

32:39.875 --> 32:43.210
- But the engine sounded lighter.
- Light. Yeah.

32:43.337 --> 32:48.299
With that much torque, she had to have
a torsion-damper system crank...

32:48.383 --> 32:50.885
and double-wishbone arrangement.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.472
Wait a minute. You shot her tire out.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.682
Yeah. Standard OP.

32:57.142 --> 33:00.478
- That's police jargon for...
- But she kept on going.

33:00.562 --> 33:04.148
- Because she had run-flats.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.610
She had runs-flats on.

33:07.694 --> 33:11.405
Armored tires. They seal themselves
with gel when punctured.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.033
They good, but they only go
for about 50 miles.

33:14.117 --> 33:17.411
If she wants to drive that car again,
she'll need a new tire.

33:17.496 --> 33:21.957
There's only one place to get that tire
here, Lou's Garage in Secaucus.

33:22.042 --> 33:25.711
What are we waiting for?
Let's hit it. We'll take my ride.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.673
There's my baby, right there.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.718
- This is your unmarked car?
- We found her.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.178
A Daewoo?

33:34.638 --> 33:37.848
Man, I know people.
I can't be seen in this thing.

33:39.434 --> 33:42.728
Open the door. I don't wanna
get Daewoo on my hands.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.025
Buckle up for safety, everybody.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.486
Hard to do it with my holster on.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.446
Okay, we're good.

33:53.115 --> 33:57.243
Good, wipers work.
Ten and 2. Mirrors work.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.495
And here we go.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.539
Damn.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.750
- Little ding.
- Man!

34:04.835 --> 34:08.545
That's why you got bumpers, kid.
That's why you got bumpers.

34:08.630 --> 34:13.050
- You trying to kill me?
- I'm not a perfect driving robot!

34:13.135 --> 34:15.052
- What are you doing?
- Here comes junior.

34:15.137 --> 34:18.139
You can't...
Oh, shit! Wait. Stop, stop!

34:18.974 --> 34:22.268
What the hell are you trying to do,
a 78-point turn?

34:23.478 --> 34:25.312
Can you get us out of this spot?

34:25.397 --> 34:28.107
Yes. Everyone just chill out.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.817
Be real cool about it.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.819
Well, goddamn!

34:31.902 --> 34:34.572
Now, I'm turning the wheel.
Turning the wheel.

34:34.656 --> 34:37.449
What the...?
Oh, my God! Wait! Wait!

34:37.534 --> 34:39.659
Hold, hold! Wait. No, stop.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.040
What?

34:45.833 --> 34:47.710
What? What do you want?

34:49.045 --> 34:51.130
- What's the problem?
- Get over there.

34:51.214 --> 34:54.382
- I got... I got shotgun.
- Get your ass over there.

34:55.135 --> 34:59.180
You got insurance? That's what
I'm gonna need. Daggone whiplash.

34:59.890 --> 35:03.184
- You got a driver's license?
- Let me get my belt on.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.563
Who gave you a driver's license?
That's what I wanna know.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.194
After I show you this place,
I get my cab back?

35:13.278 --> 35:15.029
- Deal.
- I don't trust you.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.614
Soon as I know this is the place...

35:16.698 --> 35:20.034
we'll go back to the station,
I get you your cab back.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.705
- This is it?
- Yep.

35:25.916 --> 35:29.668
If they getting that car fixed, they...
They gotta come here.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.171
So, what now?

35:32.881 --> 35:34.089
We wait.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.113
You can open your eyes now.
I'm done.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.243
You didn't see my nads, did you?

36:08.333 --> 36:11.544
- Man.
- So you got guy problems?

36:11.920 --> 36:14.088
Overheard you and your man
on the phone.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.258
Want a little bit of wisdom
from the man's side?

36:17.759 --> 36:19.552
I'll give it to you.

36:19.636 --> 36:23.305
Men are like cats. You know?

36:24.182 --> 36:26.183
Sure, we'll play with a ball of yarn.

36:26.268 --> 36:29.436
Unless you want us to play
with the ball of yarn.

36:29.938 --> 36:32.982
Trick is, hide the ball of yarn.

36:37.404 --> 36:40.614
Don't hide it where you can't find it,
you know?

36:41.950 --> 36:44.451
"What's the ball of yarn
doing in the fridge?"

36:44.536 --> 36:47.037
Whatever. You know what I'm saying?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.503
Cops are supposed to
talk on stakeouts.

36:54.588 --> 36:58.424
- It helps the mission go by faster.
- Would you please shut up?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.801
Okay. That's cool.
You wanna be quiet?

37:00.886 --> 37:03.971
That's cool.
No room for chitchat. That's fine.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.474
I don't care. I don't need to...
I don't need to talk.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.852
We'll just sit here in silence.

37:13.148 --> 37:15.149
So you into cars, or...?

37:16.026 --> 37:18.319
I mean, what got you into cars?

37:18.987 --> 37:23.407
I mean, were you always into them?
Did you just, like, stumble upon them?

37:23.742 --> 37:26.035
Damn. My grandpa. Okay?

37:27.662 --> 37:30.539
Yeah. What, he loved driving or...?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.417
Yeah, he was a mechanic.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.920
Taught me everything I know.

37:36.004 --> 37:40.466
- We used to live next to a track.
- You go to the track all day? That's fun.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.468
No, we didn't really go that much.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.929
I mean, we went to a couple races.

37:45.013 --> 37:48.515
But, mostly, we would just listen
to the races together.

37:49.517 --> 37:52.186
We could hear those cars,
those engines.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.689
I got good. I got to the point
where I could tell...

37:55.774 --> 37:58.275
who won the race
without even seeing it.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.778
Yeah, drive a NASCAR,
that's my dream.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.197
Wait, let me ask you something.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.200
Why would you take a taxi
to a bank robbery?

38:06.576 --> 38:08.827
I mean, I have never seen that.

38:08.912 --> 38:11.246
I got in a wreck in my last gig.

38:11.665 --> 38:14.458
Bad guys got away.
My lieutenant flipped out...

38:14.542 --> 38:16.460
put me back on the beat.

38:16.544 --> 38:18.796
- No vehicle.
- Oh, man.

38:19.047 --> 38:22.758
What makes it worse,
me and my lieutenant used to date.

38:23.885 --> 38:26.512
- Yeah, we went to academy together.
- Okay.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.180
She got promoted...

38:28.264 --> 38:29.682
I didn't.

38:30.308 --> 38:33.227
You can cut the sexual tension
with a knife.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.734
Look. There they are.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.490
Oh, man. Yep, that's her.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.158
That's her.

38:50.787 --> 38:52.204
Party time.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.791
So, what we gonna do now?
We gonna call it in, right?

38:55.875 --> 39:00.462
Call it in? By the time we get backup,
that soup will be cold. We go in now.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.519
Shoot. Oh, my God.

39:15.603 --> 39:19.648
Daewoo, I'm sorry. I take back
everything I said. Start for me.

39:25.655 --> 39:26.697
Hi.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.034
I'm not actually with him. He's...

39:43.173 --> 39:44.465
You okay?

39:45.050 --> 39:46.133
Yeah.

39:46.718 --> 39:47.801
Damn.

40:06.529 --> 40:08.906
- What are they saying?
- The redhead is saying...

40:08.990 --> 40:11.992
she doesn't wanna kill a cop.
If we play it cool...

40:12.077 --> 40:16.705
- Then they'll leave us here, tied up.
- Okay. Okay, I'll play it real cool.

40:16.790 --> 40:20.918
- Okay. Hey, what was that wink for?
- Hey, trust me.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.837
No, no, no, man.
What...? What was that about?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.506
- Trust me.
- Trust you?

40:25.590 --> 40:28.300
- Yeah.
- Trust you again? Hell, no. No way.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.427
No, no. Hey, excuse me!

40:30.512 --> 40:32.805
Excuse me. No. Excuse me.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.682
Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me.

40:35.767 --> 40:39.353
Don't mean to interrupt.
He's gonna do something. He winked.

40:39.437 --> 40:43.482
- Hey, what's wrong with you?
- With me? I got a problem getting shot.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.734
- Did you frisk him?
- Come on.

40:45.819 --> 40:48.654
Frisk his ass again.
He got at least one more gun.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.115
- Cavity-search him.
- I do not! I swear.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.784
He got a gun, and he's gonna use it.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.828
- He crazy.
- Whose side are you on?

40:55.912 --> 40:57.746
- Mine!
- What?

40:59.833 --> 41:02.417
You want a strip search?
Is that what you want?

41:02.502 --> 41:05.420
There's nothing up my sleeve here.
You wanna check my shoes?

41:07.048 --> 41:08.173
Go!

41:15.723 --> 41:17.099
All right, you're all under...

41:19.894 --> 41:22.646
Man, you're more dangerous
than they are!

41:26.734 --> 41:28.819
What are you doing, man?

41:28.903 --> 41:31.363
I'm evening the playing field.

41:31.447 --> 41:35.617
That's flammable gas. They won't
shoot. This whole place will blow.

41:35.702 --> 41:38.537
Man, we still in this place,
you jackass!

41:39.414 --> 41:43.458
Turn that off, and let's wait
for the cops to come. The real cops.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.464
Oh, my G... Oh, man!

41:50.466 --> 41:52.426
You smell that, ladies?

41:52.510 --> 41:55.554
That's nitrous! One shot, and boom!

41:55.972 --> 42:00.893
Now, you wanna handle this
hand to hand, man to chick...

42:01.686 --> 42:03.812
then we'll go home!

42:04.189 --> 42:05.439
Hello?

42:05.940 --> 42:08.650
- Hello?
- Ace Dumbtura, they're gone.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.945
They're gone!

42:12.614 --> 42:15.657
They're gone! They're gone!
They're not there.

42:19.245 --> 42:21.705
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh, damn.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.665
This thing's jammed.

42:25.835 --> 42:27.127
Oh, man.

42:29.756 --> 42:31.006
Dumb-ass.

42:36.638 --> 42:40.724
You can't... You can't die
from nitrous oxide, can you?

42:40.808 --> 42:43.143
It's laughing gas, stupid.

42:45.772 --> 42:47.439
- I hate you, man.
- What's that?

42:47.523 --> 42:49.650
I hate your freaking guts.

42:51.653 --> 42:54.363
You gotta be the dumbest cop
I ever met.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.411
We gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

43:01.496 --> 43:03.497
- We gotta get out.
- Okay, open the door.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.375
Open the door, man! Move.

43:09.254 --> 43:10.837
You stupid.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.340
You're so freaking dumb.

43:14.008 --> 43:17.594
Oh, wait, your car is on fire.

43:17.679 --> 43:20.555
- No. Come on.
- Daewoo can't take a little heat.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.224
Drop the weapon!

43:23.226 --> 43:24.851
- Freeze!
- Oh.

43:26.062 --> 43:27.980
Okay, this does not look good.

43:28.064 --> 43:31.817
Here's the plan, all right? Ready?
When he comes by...

43:34.570 --> 43:35.988
Or that.

43:36.990 --> 43:39.491
Wait for me! Belle! Wait up!

43:39.575 --> 43:42.786
They've gone around the backside
of the building. We need to go.

43:46.416 --> 43:48.875
I'll tell you what,
we'll go back to the station...

43:48.960 --> 43:52.254
- Search the files, see which...
- No, no. Hell, no.

43:52.338 --> 43:55.257
We ain't going nowhere.
You coming to my house...

43:55.341 --> 43:57.509
to tell my boyfriend where I was.

43:57.593 --> 43:59.678
I had a man when I went
to work today.

43:59.762 --> 44:00.887
Okay.

44:01.514 --> 44:04.141
- That's the least I can do.
- Damn straight.

44:04.225 --> 44:06.852
The most you could do
would be to get my cab back.

44:06.936 --> 44:10.856
You'll get your cab back when I catch
these guys. Girls. Women.

44:11.691 --> 44:13.108
Not before.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.070
I'm getting a little seasick.

44:23.119 --> 44:24.661
I swallowed it.

44:25.621 --> 44:28.665
I don't know if this will work.
Show your badge...

44:28.750 --> 44:30.959
because he is sensitive,
and he is pissed off.

44:31.044 --> 44:34.963
All right. I got
your back right here. I owe you one.

44:36.507 --> 44:38.425
What the hell? Jesse!

44:39.010 --> 44:40.719
Baby, you home?

44:41.929 --> 44:45.182
Wait. I can explain.
I was with this guy.

44:45.266 --> 44:47.434
Go home with him.
I'm tired of your apologies.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.395
Don't take that tone with me.
I ain't apologizing.

44:50.480 --> 44:54.691
- Don't take that tone! I've been waiting!
- Because you all screaming at me!

44:54.776 --> 44:59.112
I got this. I can handle this, all right?
I can totally handle this.

44:59.238 --> 45:01.948
What's up, bro? How you doing, man?
Yeah.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.536
Here's the deal-y, yo.

45:06.621 --> 45:10.374
It seems weird, your girl hanging
with a good-Iooking white dude...

45:10.458 --> 45:12.334
but, hey, I'm a cop.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.920
My name's Detective Washburn.

45:15.338 --> 45:18.632
- At least let me explain!
- Oh, no, not again.

45:20.093 --> 45:22.344
He's gonna give it back, right?

45:26.766 --> 45:28.433
What's that sound?

45:31.562 --> 45:32.938
Blowtorch.

45:34.774 --> 45:37.901
Blowtorch! Hey, Jesse! Thank you.

45:37.985 --> 45:39.736
Can I have my...?

45:39.821 --> 45:42.406
- At least let me explain!
- Man.

45:42.490 --> 45:43.990
Damn!

45:45.701 --> 45:49.371
Man. Well, I always wanted
a money clip.

45:50.164 --> 45:51.581
What the hell was that?

45:51.666 --> 45:53.417
It was my badge.

45:53.501 --> 45:56.586
You know what? Forget it.
I'm gonna let him cool off.

45:56.671 --> 45:59.381
- Hey, wait up.
- I know you for seven hours...

45:59.465 --> 46:02.551
I lose my cab, my boyfriend
and my apartment.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.845
- You're batting a thousand.
- Yeah?

46:04.929 --> 46:08.306
It's not enough you screw up
your own life. This your place?

46:08.391 --> 46:09.599
No. We're stopping
to get something to eat.

46:11.102 --> 46:13.687
You actually have a girlfriend?

46:16.482 --> 46:19.401
- Ma! Hi, Ma.
- Sweetheart!

46:19.485 --> 46:22.529
I love you! I love you!

46:24.407 --> 46:26.491
Ma, I brought company.

46:27.660 --> 46:29.870
Nice catch. Jungle fever.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.290
Well, you know me.

46:33.708 --> 46:36.126
Excuse me. I'm not his girlfriend.

46:36.627 --> 46:38.587
I ain't even his friend.

46:41.215 --> 46:45.969
Mom, Belle here is a cab driver,
and she witnessed a bank robbery.

46:46.053 --> 46:49.556
- She needs a place to stay.
- Get in here. Come in.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.932
Come in.

46:55.354 --> 46:58.064
Oh, you must be starving.

47:01.444 --> 47:07.824
I have got the number of a joint
that makes a General Tso's chicken.

47:08.868 --> 47:12.078
It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.

47:14.582 --> 47:16.875
- Your mom's drunk?
- Always.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.093
Where's my Daewoo?

47:28.137 --> 47:31.681
- Andy, did you do something to my car?
- Don't.

47:33.434 --> 47:35.185
- Andy.
- What?

47:35.269 --> 47:36.686
Look at me, darling.

47:36.771 --> 47:39.147
You didn't drive through
another bodega?

47:39.232 --> 47:41.650
- That was you?
- What...? What...?

47:42.068 --> 47:44.653
That was you
on the cover of the Post!

47:45.905 --> 47:47.948
- You killed that parrot.
- No.

47:48.032 --> 47:50.951
Mom, what'd I tell you about
talking police business?

47:51.035 --> 47:53.161
- Sorry.
- He had a mustache.

47:53.246 --> 47:55.288
I didn't recognize you at first.

47:55.373 --> 48:00.835
See, they took his license away.
That was the third car he totaled.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.755
He even wrecked one of those
armored machines...

48:03.839 --> 48:07.217
- With the battering rams.
- Who the hell gave him one of those?

48:07.301 --> 48:12.222
He just mowed down three mailboxes,
like that. That's a federal offense.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.974
- Yeah.
- Mom!

48:14.308 --> 48:18.395
But Andy is not a really strong driver.

48:18.479 --> 48:22.566
He had a bad experience
when he had his first driving lesson...

48:22.650 --> 48:23.650
- So...
- Driving lesson?

48:23.734 --> 48:26.820
- You call that a driving lesson?
- Yes.

48:26.904 --> 48:29.906
Dad let go and said,
"Steer or you'll kill the family."

48:29.991 --> 48:32.993
- Yeah. It's good for you.
- We were going 90. I was 6.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.579
And that's the way
he taught you to swim.

48:35.663 --> 48:38.498
- I can't swim either.
- Yes, you... Well...

48:39.166 --> 48:41.042
- Can we drop it?
- Okay.

48:41.127 --> 48:44.754
- Sure. Right.
- Okay, Ma, lock it...

48:45.464 --> 48:48.300
- nd down your brassiere it goes.
- Okay.

48:50.511 --> 48:51.636
Oh.

48:53.806 --> 48:56.016
Mommy's getting the spins.

48:57.977 --> 48:59.603
That's it for me.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.105
- That's it.
- That's it for the kid.

49:02.189 --> 49:05.108
Why don't you take good care
of this little girl.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.777
- Daddy will be so proud of you.
- Thank you.

49:07.862 --> 49:09.279
- Good night.
- Good night.

49:09.363 --> 49:12.115
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, nice to meet you too.

49:12.199 --> 49:14.034
Yes. Yes.

49:14.118 --> 49:16.453
- She'll be back.
- My drink?

49:16.537 --> 49:18.038
There it is.

49:18.497 --> 49:21.541
Don't forget that.
Mom, the bedroom's that way.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.752
Okay, sweetheart.

49:24.629 --> 49:27.714
- Oh, you're just getting the blender.
- Oh, yeah.

49:27.798 --> 49:30.675
That's... That's a 38-ounce blender,
yeah.

49:32.720 --> 49:37.557
It is getting late. Do you wanna crash
at my place until your dude cools off?

49:37.642 --> 49:39.434
Like I have a choice.

49:48.611 --> 49:51.821
Stop playing.
You live next door to your mom's?

49:52.490 --> 49:54.240
Makes her feel safe.

49:55.743 --> 49:58.787
She must not have seen you
in action?

50:02.249 --> 50:05.085
Oh, God, it feels good to lay down.

50:12.635 --> 50:14.010
Good night.

50:16.764 --> 50:20.475
What kind of grown-ass man
lives 10 feet away from his mama?

50:21.936 --> 50:25.230
I wouldn't talk so much,
Isabelle Precious Williams.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.316
Who told you about my name?

50:28.401 --> 50:31.111
It's in your record, Precious.

50:31.696 --> 50:34.239
- "My precious."
- Go ahead. Say it again.

50:34.323 --> 50:37.158
Say it again, see what happens.
I dare you.

50:47.461 --> 50:48.753
Precious.

50:59.724 --> 51:04.185
I just remembered something the girls
kept saying to each other:

51:12.737 --> 51:14.571
Yeah, that's what I said.

51:14.655 --> 51:17.407
That means "two more withdrawals."

51:17.825 --> 51:22.120
I want five cars on 14th and Broadway,
waiting, and I want them now!

51:22.997 --> 51:25.039
- Hey, I've made a major break
- Get out!

51:25.124 --> 51:27.250
- I've made a break.
- Oh, really?

51:27.334 --> 51:31.546
Does that explain a car, registered
to your mom, on fire in front of...?

51:31.630 --> 51:34.090
What's important is
they're gonna rob another bank.

51:34.175 --> 51:37.260
First Financial,
and they hit two minutes ago...

51:37.344 --> 51:41.556
and they're still inside. So I am busy.
Now, sit down and shut up.

51:43.017 --> 51:44.642
Damn, man.

51:45.978 --> 51:48.438
Car 1070. Suspects still in the bank.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.523
How would you like me to proceed?

51:50.608 --> 51:53.526
Backup units are on their way.
Do not let them leave.

51:53.611 --> 51:56.821
I don't think there's sexual tension
between you.

51:56.906 --> 52:01.326
I think that is genuine tension.
Like "she gonna fire your ass" tension.

52:01.619 --> 52:03.745
I can't stand this.
They're gonna catch them...

52:03.829 --> 52:06.539
and we're gonna
miss the whole thing.

52:06.707 --> 52:09.584
Please. Ain't no cop
gonna catch that woman.

52:09.668 --> 52:11.878
Oh, yeah, and you can, right?

52:13.088 --> 52:14.798
If I had my taxi.

52:14.882 --> 52:16.758
Right away.

52:17.802 --> 52:19.594
And keep me informed.

52:21.263 --> 52:23.056
Let's take a walk.

52:29.605 --> 52:31.648
Find Washburn. Now.

52:35.861 --> 52:38.780
- Eddie B!
- Washtub!

52:38.864 --> 52:41.282
I need your help. I gotta get the...

52:41.367 --> 52:43.243
- Crown Vic.
- Crown Vic.

52:43.327 --> 52:46.120
I need the signatures
of two officers, man.

52:46.205 --> 52:47.705
Two, perfect.

52:47.790 --> 52:50.792
One, two.
You know Lieutenant Williams, right?

52:53.087 --> 52:55.255
Williams, from SWAT.

52:55.756 --> 52:57.382
She's a jujitsu master.

52:57.466 --> 52:58.675
Really?

52:59.385 --> 53:02.554
- She has her own dojo.
- Oh, wow.

53:02.638 --> 53:04.639
- You have any fliers?
- No.

53:05.975 --> 53:07.684
- Sure don't.
- Okay.

53:07.768 --> 53:09.853
Oh, man. You gotta Friendster me.

53:09.937 --> 53:12.564
- I want a flier.
- Hey, man, got the...?

53:12.648 --> 53:14.524
Here you go.

53:14.608 --> 53:15.608
Thanks, man.

53:22.074 --> 53:24.117
Hold it right...

53:32.918 --> 53:35.420
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Officer needs assistance!

53:35.963 --> 53:37.964
Suspects
headed north on Third Avenue...

53:38.048 --> 53:40.800
- Towards the Queensboro Bridge.
- What?

53:42.469 --> 53:46.347
- What you doing? We'll lose her. Go!
- Why take the East Side?

53:46.432 --> 53:49.017
The Queensboro will be a parking lot.

53:49.101 --> 53:50.685
Oh, you ain't slick.
You heading west.

53:52.563 --> 53:55.189
You're driving the speed limit, okay?

53:55.274 --> 53:57.525
- We won't catch...
- You think you slick?

53:57.610 --> 54:00.987
You know 68th will be gridlocked.
Hunter College's semesterjust started.

54:02.323 --> 54:05.575
Unless you're gonna drive through
the damn school.

54:05.993 --> 54:09.370
Of course! She gonna take Fifth.
Hell, yeah.

54:09.580 --> 54:11.497
There's room to maneuver
down Museum Mile.

54:12.374 --> 54:16.085
And I know your crazy ass ain't
scared to get up on that sidewalk.

54:16.170 --> 54:17.170
That's what I would do.

54:19.757 --> 54:21.215
Now, if I'm right...

54:21.800 --> 54:23.676
which I believe I am...

54:24.011 --> 54:28.348
she gonna come out
right about here.

54:38.192 --> 54:40.526
Come on, let's go! Get her!

55:00.089 --> 55:03.049
I told you! Too much torque, grandma!

55:07.554 --> 55:08.888
Watch this.

55:14.895 --> 55:16.020
Whoo!

55:20.275 --> 55:21.609
Pull over!

55:22.111 --> 55:25.196
Police! Pull over the car!
Pull over right now!

55:25.739 --> 55:26.823
What?

55:27.574 --> 55:28.866
My badge.

55:30.369 --> 55:33.079
Now, pull over. This means something.

55:33.414 --> 55:35.790
It's your last chance! Come on!

55:42.256 --> 55:44.424
You trying to dent me?
Not gonna happen.

55:57.187 --> 55:58.271
Damn.

56:53.118 --> 56:54.577
Shit!

57:12.638 --> 57:15.473
Damn! I was on her ass too.

57:19.895 --> 57:22.021
Let me just...

58:26.837 --> 58:28.796
No BMWs have come through here.

58:28.881 --> 58:31.257
A red BMW cannot disappear twice.

58:31.550 --> 58:34.343
I got a blue Beemer on Morningside.

58:34.428 --> 58:35.928
Good. I'll take it.

58:44.354 --> 58:46.189
Ten-four. Units, stand by...

58:46.273 --> 58:48.274
unless you have an emergency.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.363
License and registration.

59:03.123 --> 59:05.958
I'm gonna need you
to pop the trunk for me.

59:16.261 --> 59:18.804
I gotta open it myself. It's busted.

59:20.390 --> 59:21.474
Shit.

59:26.104 --> 59:27.688
Pardon me, miss.

59:34.154 --> 59:35.613
Thank you.

59:41.536 --> 59:43.496
Could you open the case?

59:44.957 --> 59:46.040
Sure.

59:50.796 --> 59:51.879
Here.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:00.471
You ladies have a nice day.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:05.268
Miss Williams, give me your license.
I'm taking it away from you.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:06.894
- What?
- You heard me.

01:00:06.979 --> 01:00:09.605
You're not driving a taxi again.
Let's go.

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:12.024
But I made her pursue that car.

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:13.943
- Really.
- Hello.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:18.906
Well, her taxicab is in violation
of 27 vehicle codes.

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:21.200
Did you make her do that too?

01:00:22.035 --> 01:00:23.119
Yeah.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.037
Yeah, I did.

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:28.249
I ordered the modifications,
top to bottom.

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:30.751
- Top to bottom.
- Weeks ago.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:34.755
So there.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:38.884
What kind of car is it?

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.470
- Ford.
- Ford.

01:00:42.222 --> 01:00:43.597
What model?

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.689
- Nervous.
- Excuse me?

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:54.692
Roundville.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.530
You're an idiot. Give me the license.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:02.742
- Crown Victoria.
- I don't know what that means.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.454
Come on.

01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:10.124
But, see, it's the picture.
It's actually a nice...

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:11.542
- Marta...
- Lieutenant.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:14.670
- She was trying to help. Do something.
- No.

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:17.465
They stopped three BMWs.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:20.009
Let's take her so she can
hear the officers' testimony.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.261
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:28.267
Blue Beemer. This chick didn't
even know how to open the trunk.

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.019
Chick? What chick?

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:33.606
The driver.
Oh, she was a foxy little...

01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:39.695
Four women. There was
no money in the car. I searched it.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:43.616
- What are you two talking about?
- Of course. A red BMW?

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:46.702
Might as well drive
an ice-cream truck.

01:01:46.787 --> 01:01:50.331
They drove a BMW, that's what
we look for, then they change it.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:53.918
Wait a minute. You're saying that
all four robbers are women?

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.753
- Yeah.
- And you saw them?

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.463
Yeah. Last night.

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:01.801
Damn it! When were you gonna share
this information, Washburn?

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:05.846
- I tried to... I tried to tell you this mor...
- Shut up.

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:08.641
Officer Preston, come with me.
Let's go.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:14.063
You're fired. You're not suspended,
not on temporary leave, fired.

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:17.441
Miss Williams, I'm giving this
back to you with a warning.

01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:21.404
If I catch you driving that thing
in my city again, it is mine.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:23.989
Andy, as a friend, I'm sorry.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.576
- I tried this morning. I went in to...
- You left me no choice.

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.620
Now, give me your badge.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:41.590
What...?

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:55.604
Hey, wanna share a cab?

01:02:57.858 --> 01:02:59.859
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:08.868
Turn over. What? What?

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:17.209
All I ever wanted to do
was just be a cop, you know?

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.715
I wanna be like my dad, you know?
My dad was a cop.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:25.217
You know, I let him down.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.970
I let you down. You're screwed,
you can't drive this anymore.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:31.974
She did not say that.
She said not to let the cops catch me.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:37.396
I can see why you like that lieutenant.
She feisty.

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:41.901
You like us feisty girls, don't you?
So you gonna give it another shot?

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:43.986
Give it another shot? She fired me.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.448
So? Redeem yourself.
Catch these thieves.

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:52.077
Try to start this for me, please.

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:02.421
Come on. Come on.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.466
That's it. Life!

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:11.847
- Wanna take it for a spin?
- No, no, no. No, thanks.

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:14.558
- You need to practice.
- No, I drive fine.

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:18.729
- I'm not in the mood for a lesson.
- Who said anything about a lesson?

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:22.149
It's just me in the passenger seat,
and you driving.

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:24.944
It's not a driving lesson?

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:28.739
Okay. All right.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.617
Buckle up your safety belts, kids.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.827
- All right.
- Here comes Washburn.

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:35.246
Just a...

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:38.207
Just a leisurely stroll
through the evening.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.669
And here we go. Engine started.
My bad. Okay.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:44.296
Lights here. Good.
We have drive two...

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:48.133
- Which is good, the sequel to drive.
- Chill out and drive, man.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.344
Come on, now, you just gotta relax.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.013
Just... Come on, let's relax. Just...

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:04.650
I said relax, not hyperventilate.
Don't... What...? You...

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:07.820
Look how tight you gripping
the steering wheel. Damn!

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:11.907
I'm trying to get in my mode,
in the game.

01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:13.742
Why don't you let the game
come to you.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:16.412
See, that's your problem.

01:05:16.496 --> 01:05:17.955
You try too hard.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:22.126
You over-think things. You be
kicking down doors that's already open.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:26.505
You always trying to impress
somebody. Me, your dad, your ex.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:29.592
Come on, if you ever
gonna learn how to drive...

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:31.260
we gotta play to your strengths.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:35.347
And thinking ain't one of them.
So don't think.

01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.726
- Don't think. Don't think.
- Don't think. No.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.270
Just clear your mind.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.689
- Relax.
- Okay, relax.

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:45.232
Listen to some music.

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:55.117
- Oh, hell, no. Hell, no. No, man. No.
- That was pretty good.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.746
Hey, no, no! I like this one.
Oh, yeah. Wait.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:03.042
Natalie Cole, this one. Yeah,
this one's my favorite. I love this one.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:06.503
I listened to this as a little kid.
Used to sing it in my bedroom.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.839
- All right.
- I mean, I was, you know...

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:11.216
- Under supervision, everything like that.
- Whatever.

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:15.262
- Sing along to it.
- I don't wanna sing. No.

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:17.640
Come on, sing. Sing the song!

01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:30.027
Okay.

01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:34.657
All right. There you go. There you go.
All right, now, put it in drive.

01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:35.824
Okay.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:40.162
Who said stop singing? Sing!

01:06:41.873 --> 01:06:44.583
Sing the damn song!
There we go.

01:06:45.752 --> 01:06:46.960
Shoulders down.

01:06:47.462 --> 01:06:48.587
Relax. Yeah.

01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:50.506
There you go.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:06:58.764
You got it. You got it, man.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.783
Hold on to the wheel. There you go.

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:22.287
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, dude, you driving.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:30.546
Wait. Please just stop bugging
for two minutes...

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:33.674
- And let me just explain...
- Are you okay? I've been worried sick.

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:36.635
- Yeah.
- Come here, girl.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.141
- Baby, what are you doing here?
- You left your phone here.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.935
He called, and I explained
everything to him.

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:48.981
And, Belle, he's a dream.
Come on in.

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:52.276
- So you're not mad?
- How could I be mad?

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.737
- You was mad at me.
- I wasn't that mad. Come here.

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.950
- I missed you.
- I missed you too, baby.

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:03.245
Oh, my.

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:07.583
- This is like watching pay-per-view.
- Mother!

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:11.879
Clear your throat.

01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:16.258
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:20.554
- Come on, let's go home.
- You're not going. I made dinner.

01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:22.765
- No, you didn't.
- No, I didn't.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:25.142
But I made margaritas.

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:26.810
And we can order.

01:08:26.895 --> 01:08:28.520
Oh, boy, can we order.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.441
Let's be logical. Let's go through
the story one more time.

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:35.277
Okeydoke. BMW pulls out in front.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:38.781
That's the amazing thing right there.
Getting a parking space in Manhattan.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:41.450
Jesse's totally right. Wait a sec.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:46.078
How do you get parking in front of a
bank, two days in a row, in Manhattan?

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.832
The only places I ever find
are no-parking zones.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:52.711
Loading zones, hospitals
or streets that are no parking for...

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.470
- Garbage day.
- Yeah, the whole side of the street...

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:05.098
- Is a no-parking zone.
- Of course.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:09.937
They rob the bank early in the morning.
They put the cash in the garbage can.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:14.566
We chase the Beemer, the garbage truck
picks up the cash, they meet later.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:17.819
Even if you catch them,
they ain't got the money on them.

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.697
The only thing they need
is a garbage man.

01:09:21.241 --> 01:09:23.658
We gotta find that garbage man.
Bye, Ma.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.285
Hold on. Where you think you going?

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:26.703
Bye, baby.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:30.374
Wait, wait! Hey, what do you
want me to do with this?

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:35.837
We can't wait till the morning. The FBI
may have caught them by then.

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:39.216
I mean... You know what I mean.
Just keep a lookout.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:43.428
Hurry up.

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:49.560
Voilà.

01:09:50.812 --> 01:09:53.564
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't think they have an alarm?

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:56.817
Come on, it's not Fort Knox.
It's the Department of Sanitation.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.780
Plan B, plan B.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:10.873
Police. We heard the alarm.
What's going on here? Everything cool?

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:13.208
- You all right?
- Officer Mullins.

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.627
- This is Officer...
- Goodsnatch.

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:18.881
Hello. What do we have here?
Obvious B and E.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:22.259
Perps might be still inside.
Way to stay cool. Way to stay cool.

01:10:22.343 --> 01:10:27.472
Look, they even left their lock picks.
Surely they got prints on these.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:31.810
Gotta... Gotta tag these.
What's your name, sir?

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:33.687
- Verne.
- "Ern"?

01:10:34.022 --> 01:10:36.023
- Verne!
- Bern, where's the...?

01:10:36.107 --> 01:10:37.274
Verne!

01:10:38.109 --> 01:10:39.234
- Bern?
- Verne.

01:10:39.319 --> 01:10:41.862
Verne. Where's the nearest computer?

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.031
Computers are inside. Follow me.

01:10:44.866 --> 01:10:46.575
We find out who works 36th Street...

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:49.077
from Third to Broadway
on Wednesday...

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:52.414
Leonard and Church on Thursday,
bang, we got our man.

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.708
Okay. "Personnel. Routes."
Here we go.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:58.128
Routes. All right, 36th, Wednesday.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:02.215
- There we go. We got our man.
- Anthony Scalia.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:04.885
Same garbage man got both routes.
You see that?

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:08.847
"3 East 117th Street. Apartment 4R."
Yeah. Let's go.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.185
I'm getting used to your driving.

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:28.241
Here's the plan.
I'm gonna need you to boost me up...

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:31.995
- To that fire escape, okay?
- Cable.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:40.087
Mr. Scalia, it's the police. Open up.

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:51.682
Thanks.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:53.934
Stay back.

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.401
Damn.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.111
Hello?

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.706
One last pickup, then you are free.

01:12:16.082 --> 01:12:19.751
You bring us the cash again,
then, hey...

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:23.171
we let you go. We let your wife go.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:28.051
After I bring you the money,
how do I know what will happen then?

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:29.678
You don't.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.180
But if you go to the police...

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:35.475
you do know what will happen, no?

01:12:47.447 --> 01:12:48.905
So that's the best way over here.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:54.703
We get in from here, and I think
the best way out is coming from here...

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:56.621
so we can make it faster.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:07.466
- Your car, sir.
- Okay, girls, time to go.

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:13.597
Don't transfer me. I need the
garbage route ofAnthony Scalia.

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:15.057
It's an emergency. Now!

01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:17.893
Look, it was on the fridge.

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:20.854
He works midtown today,
then he's off for two weeks.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.856
- Oh, my God, it's gotta be today.
- Yep.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:27.903
Get me Lieutenant Robbins.
This is Washburn. Marta...

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:31.156
Whatever you're gonna say,
I don't wanna get into this now.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.867
- I got FBI all over my ass.
- Lieutenant...

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:36.495
- With all due respect...
- I can't hear you...

01:13:36.579 --> 01:13:37.913
Shut up, Marta!

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:41.750
They're using garbage trucks
to get the money out.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:44.836
Both robberies were on the same
garbage man's route.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.422
There's gonna be another robbery
this morning.

01:13:47.507 --> 01:13:51.093
I know. I'm 100 percent sure.
Please trust me, will you?

01:13:52.512 --> 01:13:54.096
- What bank?
- It's gonna happen...

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.390
somewhere between 23rd and 34th,
east of Fifth.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.610
Down! Down!
Shut up! Everybody down!

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.863
If I see anybody's eyes, I'll shoot!

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.159
You, on the ground! Now!

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:20.914
Pull over. Stop. Stop.

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.292
Pull over.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.852
One squad car?

01:14:45.731 --> 01:14:47.607
She didn't believe me.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.903
So? So, what we gonna do?

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.751
Hold back! Hold!

01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:11.006
Hey, grab somebody.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.924
Drop your weapons
and step out of the car!

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:27.564
On the ground now!

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:29.357
In this skirt?

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.527
I don't think so.

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.119
Come on, come on.

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:48.752
Now, I'm going to drive away.
And if I see any cops, the kid dies.

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:52.130
- Okay, girls, let's go.
- Wait. Wait, wait.

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:59.387
Can't let you take him.
Look, take me.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:00.972
- Okay?
- Robbins.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.143
- Marta.
- It's okay.

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:12.525
Okay.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.946
Come here. Get over here.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.492
Spread them. Let's make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:33.922
Turn around.

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:36.549
Damn.

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:55.026
Oh, Jesus. Would you take me too?

01:16:57.905 --> 01:17:00.991
Okay. Get in the car.
Come on, come on.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.372
Any cops follow me, she dies.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:11.334
Belle, we gotta do something.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.965
All units, all units...

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.800
be on the lookout for a blue BMW...

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:22.137
- Headed north on Park Avenue.
- This is air unit 1070.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:25.348
We lost them.
Have no visual of the suspects.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:29.394
Suspects last seen in the vicinity
of 42nd and Vanderbilt...

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.062
near Grand Central Station.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.828
Washburn,
you stay out of this, all right?

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:51.207
- Whatever you got planned, don't do it.
- I don't got a plan.

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:54.669
All units, suspects still at large.

01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:57.047
Last seen headed north
on Third Avenue.

01:17:58.090 --> 01:17:59.341
Calling my own backup.

01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:06.931
Be on the lookout for a blue BMW.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.184
- Mario.
- Belle, what's going on, girl?

01:18:09.268 --> 01:18:11.853
Yo, listen, listen. I need your help.

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.481
Mr. Scalia, I'm a police officer.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:18.443
Come on, who's got them?
Who's got them?

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:20.236
We haven't seen anything yet.

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:36.836
I got them. 57th and Third, northbound.

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:40.632
- Damn! They're probably at...
- 65th Street, heading north.

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:44.135
Damn.

01:18:44.512 --> 01:18:46.221
We don't have anybody up there.

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:47.764
I'm on my way.

01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:00.944
- Hey, I got your money.
- Against the wall.

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:03.321
- Oh, shoot, you got a gun.
- Who are you?

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:13.581
Ifthey get
past 125th, we're gonna lose them.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.303
- You got punk'd.
- Sit down.

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:30.098
- You okay, Mrs. Scalia? It's okay.
- Help me.

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:32.267
It's okay. It's okay.

01:19:32.852 --> 01:19:34.394
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:36.855
Come on, get out of here.

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:40.358
Oh, my baby. Thank you.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.745
- That's a cool car.
- You can have it.

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:54.539
Have fun.

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:58.835
They can chase him for a little while.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:01.379
Oh, cool.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:03.298
- Where's Marta?
- Who's Marta?

01:20:03.382 --> 01:20:06.676
- Where did they go?
- They never tell me anything. I swear.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.303
Oh, shit.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:11.055
Oh, my God. Look at all this money.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.184
I'm gonna take a couple thou
for the damage to my cab...

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:17.937
because ain't nobody paying for that
quick enough. Oh, my God.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.861
- Hello.
- All right, check it out.

01:20:24.945 --> 01:20:27.739
They stopped
at Marcus Garvey Avenue and 122nd.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:30.533
They're switching
into two silver Beemers, M3s.

01:20:30.618 --> 01:20:32.202
Put her on the phone.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.163
- Excuse me, Ma.
- What?

01:20:35.247 --> 01:20:36.581
You got a phone call.

01:20:39.293 --> 01:20:40.793
- Hello?
- Chasing you around...

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:45.256
- Has been so much fun. And this tip...
- What are you talking about?

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:48.801
- I'm talking about your money.
- We got your money, all of it.

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:50.261
Hey, you tell her. Tell her.

01:20:51.931 --> 01:20:55.016
- That cop chasing you, not a real cop...
- Shut up. Be quiet.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.269
He is a real cop. He just got fired.

01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:01.940
- What do you want, cabby?
- I'll tell you what I want.

01:21:02.274 --> 01:21:03.900
- What do I want?
- Trade. Trade.

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.485
I wanna trade.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:08.488
The money for the girl. I always wanted
to say some shit like that.

01:21:08.572 --> 01:21:09.572
Come on.

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:12.367
- Deal.
- Yeah, all right.

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:16.788
We make the exchange
on 125th Street and 12th Avenue.

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:18.540
Three minutes. No tricks.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:19.958
Three minutes. Whatever.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:23.086
Let's get the rest of the money
in the bag.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:25.880
Yo, yo, my phone!

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:32.887
You heard her, Mullins, three minutes.
Haul ass and stay out of sight.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:37.475
Don't worry. We'll have the roadblock
set up. Don't wait for us.

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:48.486
Either backup is lying really low,
or they not here.

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:49.821
What if she doesn't take the bait?

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:57.245
- Change of plans.
- Thought we had a deal.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:58.454
Never said I was stopping.

01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:02.166
We'll make the exchange on the go,
if you keep up in that heap.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:21.019
Washburn. Turn the car around!

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:27.233
"Don't wait for me." He must've
thought he sounded so cool saying that.

01:22:27.318 --> 01:22:29.402
What are we doing? We need a plan.

01:22:29.486 --> 01:22:30.987
I'm working on it.

01:23:04.938 --> 01:23:06.314
No more chitchat!

01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:10.276
- Give me the cash, or I shoot the girl!
- All right! Just calm down!

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.074
I got a plan.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:18.826
- But we need to stall.
- What?

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:22.246
Start the transfer,
but don't complete it.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:26.334
Trust me.

01:23:27.628 --> 01:23:28.628
All right.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.223
Too early! Not yet!

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:42.433
Trust me.

01:23:45.729 --> 01:23:48.398
These two big trucks coming up,
is this part of your plan?

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:53.236
- Get me in! Get me in!
- Come on!

01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.330
- Truck!
- Too early, get out!

01:24:04.415 --> 01:24:06.499
- Get out! Get out of here!
- What?

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:13.589
Get me in! Get me in!

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:16.509
- We gotta stall.
- What are you talking about?

01:24:16.593 --> 01:24:18.344
- Trust me.
- Hey, got a car coming!

01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:34.026
The exit's coming up.
We need them to take it.

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:35.862
This way! Less traffic!

01:24:45.330 --> 01:24:47.749
Give me the cash! No more games!

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:50.084
- Girl first!
- No! Girl first!

01:24:50.169 --> 01:24:52.837
- No! We'll switch same time!
- On three!

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:54.881
- One!
- One!

01:24:57.384 --> 01:24:58.801
- Two!
- Two!

01:25:00.345 --> 01:25:02.013
Three!

01:25:05.893 --> 01:25:07.059
Brake!

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:45.139
Yeah!

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:53.523
Die!

01:25:55.609 --> 01:25:56.818
Oh, shoot.

01:26:01.114 --> 01:26:03.366
Jesus, you're hit.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.284
That skank shot me.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:07.411
- We gotta get you to a hospital.
- Come on.

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:10.414
Stay down. Stay low.

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:14.085
- Watch out.
- Watch your head. Okay.

01:26:16.505 --> 01:26:19.090
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:22.176
- I should drive. Come on.
- No, I got it. Hang in there.

01:26:22.261 --> 01:26:23.511
- He's got it.
- He don't.

01:26:23.595 --> 01:26:25.805
- He's got it. You got it, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:26:27.266 --> 01:26:28.891
I'm letting the game come to me.

01:26:40.529 --> 01:26:43.030
- Why are you singing?
- Don't stop.

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:44.907
- Why is he singing?
- He sings. Don't stop.

01:26:44.992 --> 01:26:46.117
He sings?

01:27:20.652 --> 01:27:24.113
Hello. Yeah, get me St. Mary's
emergency room.

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:27.867
Washburn, there's the exit.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:32.747
The rooms are prepped for surgery.
Pull up to the ER...

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:34.832
and park in the white zone, but not...

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.387
Okay, let's get this woman to surgery!

01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:49.847
Come on! Move it!

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:53.726
And when you get her there,
prep her! Quickly!

01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:56.729
Get to stepping, people! There ain't
nothing for you to see here!

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:57.521
Move it!

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.068
Welcome, NASCAR race fans.

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:04.111
We got a lot going on this weekend.

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:08.199
Several NASCAR racing divisions
are represented here today.

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:11.243
Rookie driver Belle Williams,
with her new sponsor...

01:28:11.328 --> 01:28:14.914
the Banks of New York, is taking
to the track for the first time...

01:28:14.998 --> 01:28:17.124
to practice for her racing division.

01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:29.136
The crew stands to make money.
We all bet on you.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:32.890
You know where your money's good.
Check the stat on the tires.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:35.643
- Yo, you got visitors.
- Hey!

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:38.187
Oh, my gosh, you look great.
That's so cool.

01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:40.856
- You look so cool.
- Hey.

01:28:40.941 --> 01:28:43.734
- You look great.
- Hi.

01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:45.987
- I love it.
- How are you, Belle?

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:49.407
What do you think?
It's our latest undercover assignment.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.283
Russian mafia.

01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:55.162
- I buy it, I buy it.
- How are your sponsors treating you?

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:57.748
Oh, good. Check it out.
They have hooked me up.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:00.668
This is unbelievable. It's great.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:04.338
I remember saving this one.
I remember saving this one.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:06.590
- Hey, Jesse.
- What's up, man?

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:11.262
Don't tell me. What do you got?
Probably a 358 Cl, four-barrel carb...

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.015
720 horsepower...

01:29:14.099 --> 01:29:15.641
8500 rpm.

01:29:16.018 --> 01:29:19.770
- I'm impressed.
- Oh, he's got it written on his hand.

01:29:20.647 --> 01:29:21.897
- Mom...
- Come on.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:23.691
- She's wasted.
- Come on.

01:29:25.944 --> 01:29:29.280
Oh, Jesse, come on,
let's have a cold one, okay?

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:33.159
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- She needs a cold one.

01:29:33.618 --> 01:29:35.244
- You watch your ass out there.
- I will.

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:37.455
- Because it's mine.
- I will.

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:42.710
- Anyway... We gotta split. Party time.
- Yeah.

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:44.920
- Good luck.
- Let's go. Bye.

01:29:45.756 --> 01:29:47.339
- What are you...?
- I thought...

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:50.259
Sorry, I thought there was
a moment. Did you not...?

01:29:50.594 --> 01:29:52.511
- You keep giving signals.
- No signals.

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:54.263
There's no moment.

01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:58.100
There'll be others. There'll be others.

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:02.563
Hey, take care of yourself, Five-O.

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:05.733
And don't do nothing
crazy or stupid, all right?

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:08.402
Crazy and stupid's my style!

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:12.698
That yours?

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:18.245
- Oh, my God.
- That's your boy. That's your boy.

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.705
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:30:21.541 --> 01:30:24.001
All the cars
are heading out to the track.

01:30:24.086 --> 01:30:26.253
Practice is now under way.

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:29.965
We have a special announcement
on the JumboTron...

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:33.761
for Banks of New York driver
Belle Williams, from Jesse.

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:40.976
Oh, my God!

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:44.522
Yes! Yes! Of course I will!

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.820
And we see
NASCAR's premiere series driver...

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:54.198
Jeff Gordon, returning to the drive...

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.909
- Congratulations, Belle.
- Thanks, Jeff.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.788
- You ready?
- Ready to try and smoke you.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:04.583
- Let's do this thing.
- All right, let's do it.

01:31:20.725 --> 01:31:23.227
What's up, bro?
How you doing? Yeah.

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:27.815
Yeah?

01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:41.120
Get in the car.

01:31:41.204 --> 01:31:46.041
- Sorry. I pinched her butt.
- Mark. Tail slate.

01:31:47.002 --> 01:31:49.587
All right, here we go.
Here comes Junior.

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:54.466
What? Where he...? Oh, Lord!

01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:56.427
What the...?

01:31:58.597 --> 01:31:59.805
Cut!

01:32:01.141 --> 01:32:02.516
Yo, where in the car?

01:32:02.851 --> 01:32:06.562
- Door panel on the left. Just pull it.
- Oh, say it, don't spray it.

01:32:07.606 --> 01:32:10.774
- They're after computers?
- No, they're after your balls.

01:32:10.859 --> 01:32:12.943
Yeah. They're after the computers.

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:17.156
Next time you guys
in Havana, give me a call.

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:21.202
We'll play PlayStation.
You know, play... You know, hang out.

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:23.871
Eat a gordita.
It's a taco inside another taco.

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:27.082
Soft inside of a hard one.
More beef and beans, beef...

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:29.126
another taco and into another one.

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:33.839
You must be starving, little baby.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.718
Door panel on the left.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.429
You make me mad, dude.

01:32:40.513 --> 01:32:42.473
Door panel on the left.

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:44.266
- Yeah.
- Just pull it.

01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:46.977
- I'm telling you, you could...
- Baby.

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.520
Be there.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.732
I don't know why I'm putting
the phone here.

01:32:51.816 --> 01:32:54.735
- Your shoulder has something to say.
- I don't know.

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:56.820
Just pull it.

01:32:59.491 --> 01:33:01.325
- Just grab it...
- "Grab it" is better.

01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:06.497
I can't believe this day.
This is the worst day of my life.

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:11.627
I sound like Barry White's
illegitimate white grandson.

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:06.487
