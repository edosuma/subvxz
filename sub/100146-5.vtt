WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.436
PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL AMERICAN"...

00:02.436 --> 00:05.372
I HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH GRACE JAMES.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.374
GRACE, VOICE-OVER: I'M GONNA GET
A PATERNITY TEST DONE.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.743
YOU DESERVE TO KNOW
IF DILLON IS YOUR SON OR NOT.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.612
I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE
WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.281
CARA: WHO KEEPS
BLOWING YOU UP?

00:14.281 --> 00:16.149
WHO THE HELL IS SIMONE?

00:16.149 --> 00:17.451
N-NOBODY.
GIVE ME MY PHONE.

00:17.451 --> 00:20.187
- OH, MY GOD! AAH!
- OH, NO! NO, NO, NO!

00:20.187 --> 00:21.555
LAURA: YOU ARE GROUNDED

00:21.555 --> 00:24.191
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN
LEGALLY GROUND YOU,

00:24.191 --> 00:26.226
AND YOUR BIRTHDAY
PARTY IS CANCELED.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.629
THIS IS MY DAD,
CLIFF MOSLEY,
LEAD BOOSTER

00:28.629 --> 00:30.764
AND LEAD MEMBER OF
YOUR EVER-EXPANDING
FAN CLUB.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.766
CLIFF: WE GOT TO GET
THAT DINNER ON THE BOOKS
ONE OF THESE NIGHTS.

00:32.766 --> 00:36.236
- WHAT ARE THESE?
- LETTERS TO MY BOYS,
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

00:36.236 --> 00:39.206
BILLY: COREY, DON'T DO THIS
TO YOUR FAMILY. COREY!

00:39.206 --> 00:42.276
SPENCER: LAYLA, THINGS HAVE BEEN
KINDA DIFFERENT WITH YOU LATELY.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.512
OLIVIA: I'VE SEEN
DEPRESSION, AND THERE ARE
DEFINITELY SIGNS THERE.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.514
- WHAT SHOULD I DO?
- I'VE GOT TO CALL HER POPS.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.349
LAYLA: I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO HEAR IT.
YOU CAN JUST GET OUT.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.285
- LAYLA--
- GET OUT!

00:53.654 --> 00:56.123
WE WERE JUST WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

00:56.123 --> 01:00.794
I GET THAT, ESPECIALLY
AFTER WHATEVER SPENCER WAS
TELLING YOU, BUT I'M FINE.

01:00.794 --> 01:04.598
WELL, JUST REMEMBER,
THIS IS BECAUSE WE
CARE ABOUT YOU.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.534
WHAT IS?

01:17.210 --> 01:19.146
HI, HONEY.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.685
DAD?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.620
WHAT IS THIS?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.822
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A SEAT, HONEY?

01:28.822 --> 01:31.558
DR. GURMAN
WILL EXPLAIN.

01:35.896 --> 01:39.800
EVERYONE GATHERED HERE
TODAY LOVES YOU, LAYLA...

01:41.301 --> 01:44.237
BUT THEY'RE SCARED.

01:44.237 --> 01:48.909
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER
AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:48.909 --> 01:52.245
TEENS TODAY ARE FACED
WITH SO MUCH PRESSURE

01:52.245 --> 01:54.481
TO BE PERFECT.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.651
WE'RE GATHERED HERE TODAY
BECAUSE YOUR FRIENDS

01:57.651 --> 02:00.320
AND FAMILY ARE CONCERNED

02:00.320 --> 02:02.689
ABOUT YOUR ERRATIC BEHAVIOR

02:02.689 --> 02:05.359
AND LOSS OF INTEREST
IN DAILY ACTIVITIES.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.696
DOCTOR: WE'RE HERE
TO GIVE YOU HELP.

02:09.696 --> 02:12.966
YOUR FATHER AND I
HAVE AGREED THAT
AN INPATIENT TREA--

02:12.966 --> 02:14.768
WAIT.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.903
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO
HAVE ME COMMITTED?

02:16.903 --> 02:20.340
- NO ONE WANTS YOU COMMITTED.
- I KNOW WHAT "INPATIENT
TREATMENT" MEANS.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.909
THIS IS
RIDICULOUS. NO.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.612
I KNOW THAT THIS IS
DIFFICULT, BUT YOUR
BEHAVIOR HAS RAISED QUES--

02:25.612 --> 02:29.750
ACCORDING TO THEM,
TO MY EX-BOYFRIEND
AND PRINCESS REHAB HERE,

02:29.750 --> 02:31.818
THEY SAY I'VE BEEN
ACTING DIFFERENTLY,
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN,

02:31.818 --> 02:33.987
YOU ALL AGREE I NEED
PROFESSIONAL HELP.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.922
OLIVIA:
COME ON. THE LIES?

02:35.922 --> 02:38.725
I MEAN, YOU
TRASHED YOUR OWN HOUSE.
WE SAW YOUR HOTEL ROOM.

02:38.725 --> 02:41.728
SPENCER: PLEASE DON'T
ACT LIKE WE'RE JUST
MAKING THIS UP, LAYLA.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.264
I SEEN THE CUTS
ON YOUR ARM.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.867
STOPPED WEARING
THE BRACELETS

02:46.867 --> 02:49.569
THAT WERE CAUSING
THE CUTS, SEE? HEALED.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.271
AND I AM NOT
THE ONLY TEENAGER

02:51.271 --> 02:54.274
WHO SKIPPED CLASS
OR HAS A MESSY ROOM.

02:56.943 --> 03:00.981
LOOK, I AGREE I
COULD HAVE...HANDLED
THE BREAK-IN BETTER,

03:00.981 --> 03:04.351
BUT...I WAS SCARED.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.619
W-W-WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.020
BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAD TO TELL YOU.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.655
YOU SHOULD HAVE
COME HOME.

03:08.655 --> 03:11.024
YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.294
YOU SHOULD HAVE...
BEEN MY DAD.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.664
COULDN'T WE JUST TALK,
JUST YOU AND ME?

03:17.664 --> 03:19.933
PLEASE, JUST YOU AND ME?
- S-SURE, SURE, OK.

03:19.933 --> 03:24.571
MR. KEATING, IT'S NORMAL
TO FEEL GUILTY, BUT--

03:24.571 --> 03:27.507
YOU DID SAY THERE WERE OTHER
OUTPATIENT OPTIONS, RIGHT?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.523
SORRY.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.425
MY MOM'S BEEN
CALLING NONSTOP.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.861
HEY, HEY, WHAT'S UP?

03:51.565 --> 03:53.567
DILLON: "I WANT YOU TO KNOW

03:53.567 --> 03:55.569
"THAT I'M PROUD OF YOU

03:55.569 --> 03:57.671
"AND THE LITTLE MAN
THAT YOU'RE BECOMING.

03:57.671 --> 04:00.373
"I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED
FOR A BETTER SON,

04:00.373 --> 04:02.776
"AND I'M SO SORRY I COULDN'T
BE A BETTER FATHER.

04:02.776 --> 04:06.480
"I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'LL
ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.448
DAD."

04:10.350 --> 04:14.054
DILLON: HE BOUGHT US TICKETS
TO THE COMIC EXPO THIS WEEKEND.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.857
I MEAN, WHY WOULD HE DO THAT
IF HE WAS JUST GONNA LEAVE?

04:16.857 --> 04:20.861
BILLY:
I WISH I HAD MORE
ANSWERS FOR YOU, MAN.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.663
COREY JUST ASKED ME
TO DROP THE LETTERS OFF.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.899
HE DIDN'T SAY
NOTHING TO YOU
AT THE REUNION?

04:25.899 --> 04:29.503
NOTHING THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN WHY HE'D DO THIS,

04:29.503 --> 04:30.804
AGAIN.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.472
DILLON: IF HE DIDN'T
WANT TO GO TO THE EXPO,

04:32.472 --> 04:33.974
HE COULD HAVE
JUST SAID THAT.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.842
I MEAN, WE COULD HAVE
PRACTICED FOOTBALL

04:35.842 --> 04:37.477
IF THAT'S WHAT HE
WANTED. I COULD--

04:37.477 --> 04:40.347
HEY! THIS AIN'T
ON YOU, A'IGHT?

04:40.347 --> 04:43.350
NOTHING YOU DID
OR DIDN'T DO MADE
COREY LEAVE.

04:43.350 --> 04:46.419
AIN'T NOBODY TO BLAME
FOR THIS BUT COREY,
YOU HEAR ME, DILLON?

04:46.419 --> 04:48.021
SPENCER, PLEASE.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.023
SPENCER: I'M SORRY, MA,
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH,

04:50.023 --> 04:52.659
AND THE SOONER WE ALL
ACCEPT THAT, THE BETTER.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.094
WE'VE ALL GOT A LOT
TO PROCESS--

04:54.094 --> 04:55.862
COME ON! WHAT'S
THE PROCESS?

04:55.862 --> 04:58.632
I REMEMBER ALL THIS
FROM WHEN COREY LEFT
THE FIRST TIME.

04:58.632 --> 05:02.002
I SPENT YEARS ASKING
MYSELF WHAT I DID
TO MAKE HIM LEAVE,

05:02.002 --> 05:05.138
WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE
TO MAKE HIM STAY, HOW
COULD I BRING HIM BACK.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.073
I'M NOT DOING
THAT AGAIN!

05:12.579 --> 05:15.081
I'M SORRY, LITTLE MAN.
I KNOW THIS SUCKS,

05:15.081 --> 05:18.819
BUT I'MA TELL YOU WHAT
I WISH SOMEBODY HAD
TOLD ME BACK THEN.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.689
COREY LEFT 'CAUSE
THAT'S WHO HE IS--

05:22.689 --> 05:25.525
NOT A HUSBAND,
NOT A FATHER,

05:25.525 --> 05:27.460
JUST A DISAPPOINTMENT.

05:28.895 --> 05:32.732
AND THE SOONER WE
PUT HIM BEHIND US
THE BETTER.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.584
PACKED YOU A LUNCH.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.919
YOU BETTER HURRY IF YOU
DON'T CATCH THE EXPRESS.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.921
I'M GONNA WALK
DILLON TO SCHOOL.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.890
AND MISS YOUR
FIRST PERIOD?

05:56.890 --> 05:58.692
LETTING HIM KNOW I'M HERE FOR
HIM IS MORE IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.627
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE
DOING LAST NIGHT?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.762
I SHOULDN'T HAVE RAISED
MY VOICE, A'IGHT? I'M SORRY.

06:02.762 --> 06:05.565
SPENCER, HONEY,
IT'S OK TO HURT.

06:05.565 --> 06:09.069
BUT DON'T
BOTTLE IT UP.
TALK TO ME.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.973
AIN'T GOT TO WORRY
ABOUT ME, MA. I'M FINE.
DILLON, LET'S BOUNCE.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.443
HEY.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.511
GRACE: PACKED YOU
TWO DESSERTS TODAY.

06:18.511 --> 06:20.513
THANK YOU.

06:20.513 --> 06:24.017
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WALK ME TO SCHOOL.
I GOT IT.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.721
- YOU SURE?
- LIKE YOU SAID,

06:27.721 --> 06:30.857
THE SOONER WE PUT HIM
BEHIND US THE BETTER.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.167
♪ YEAH, I REMEMBER
THOSE SUNNY DAZE ♪

06:41.167 --> 06:43.169
♪ BACK WHEN WE WERE YOUNG,

GETTING OUR PHONES TAKEN,
AND BIRTHDAY CANCELED--

06:47.707 --> 06:49.876
AND YET HERE YOU ARE,
TALKING TO ME.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.212
DON'T BE AN ASS, OK?
THIS IS SERIOUS.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.981
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SPENCER?
HE MISSED FIRST PERIOD.

06:54.981 --> 06:58.551
NO, AND I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE COREY GHOSTED AGAIN.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.887
WELL, YEAH,
AND WITH HIS DAD GONE
AND THE WHOLE BREAK-UP

07:00.887 --> 07:03.523
WITH LAYLA, I MEAN, HE'S
GONNA NEED US TO TALK TO.

07:03.523 --> 07:07.027
LOOK, LIV, IF HE
WANTS TO TALK TO US,
HE'LL TALK, OK?

07:07.027 --> 07:09.029
IF HE WANTS TO COME
TO CLASS, HE'LL COME.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.031
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HELP
TO BUTT YOUR NOSE IN.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.566
YEAH, I KINDA LEARNED
THAT LESSON YESTERDAY

07:13.566 --> 07:15.502
WITH LAYLA'S
FAILED INTERVENTION.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.104
OH, MY GOD. THERE SHE IS.
THERE SHE IS. WHAT DO I DO?

07:18.104 --> 07:20.640

LAYLA:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BAKERS!

07:23.243 --> 07:26.146
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOUR MOM CANCELED YOUR PARTY.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.648
JORDAN:
YEAH, ME, EITHER.
IT'S A BUMMER.

07:28.648 --> 07:32.052
IT'S OK. WE'LL MAKE UP
FOR IT NEXT YEAR.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.887
FOR SURE.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.824
OK.

07:39.826 --> 07:42.162
- SHE SEEMS FINE.
- FINE?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.531
JORDAN, I TRIED
TO HAVE HER COMMITTED,

07:44.531 --> 07:47.067
LIKE, YESTERDAY, AND SHE
JUST GAVE ME A HUG.
THAT IS NOT FINE.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.736

08:10.123 --> 08:11.825
YOU AIN'T BOTHERING
ME, MISS GRACE.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.561
MORE LIKE
SAVING ME FROM THESE
LINEAR EQUATIONS

08:14.561 --> 08:16.663
AND THE REST
OF THIS CRAZINESS.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.299
YOUR MOTHER MENTIONED
I'D FIND YOU HERE.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.801
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM SPENCER?

08:21.801 --> 08:25.205
I'M SORRY
ABOUT MR. JAMES.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.707
SO SPENCER TALKED TO YOU.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.008
I MEAN, "TALKING"
IS A STRETCH.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.844
IT WAS LITERALLY
JUST ONE TEXT.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.580
BUT DON'T WORRY,
I'LL WEAR HIM DOWN
EVENTUALLY.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.016
THANK YOU.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.723
NOW, YOU OK,
MS. GRACE?

08:43.723 --> 08:45.725
YEAH.

08:45.725 --> 08:49.028
YEAH, IT'S JUST...

08:49.028 --> 08:51.631
SPENCER'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO PROTECT ME, YOU KNOW?

08:51.631 --> 08:53.633
HEY, THAT'S SPENCER.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.235
AS A MOTHER,

08:55.235 --> 08:58.071
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
STRONG FOR YOUR KIDS.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.110
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS SEEM
LIKE IT'S THE OTHER WAY
AROUND WITH HIM?

09:06.146 --> 09:08.782
SOMETIMES I JUST WONDER IF
I'VE DONE MY JOB AS HIS MOM.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.650
COME ON, MS. GRACE.
THAT'S CRAZY.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.652
EVERYBODY KNOWS
SPENCER AND DILLON ARE

09:12.652 --> 09:14.621
LUCKY AS HELL TO HAVE
YOU AS THEIR MOMS.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.990
ALL RIGHT, SPENCER
DOESN'T PUT HIS PROBLEMS
ON OTHER PEOPLE

09:16.990 --> 09:20.160
BECAUSE HE CARES
ABOUT 'EM; I MEAN, HE
GOES ABOUT IT STUPID,

09:20.160 --> 09:24.330
BUT IT'S ONLY
BECAUSE HE CARES,
AND THAT'S FROM YOU.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.966
ALL RIGHT?

09:34.007 --> 09:36.709
HEY, STRANGER,
GOT A MINUTE?

09:36.709 --> 09:38.711
- GOT TO GET HOME.
- OK, WELL,

09:38.711 --> 09:42.182
I CAN TAKE YOU HOME
AFTER YOU GO TO DINNER
WITH ME AND MY DAD.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.651
WE HAVE A PRIVATE ROOM
AT THE LOBSTER TAIL,
7 P.M.

09:44.651 --> 09:47.854
- CAN'T TONIGHT. SORRY.
- MY DAD'S GONNA START
TAKING THIS PERSONALLY.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.355
DARNELL: YO, SPENCER.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.257
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:51.257 --> 09:52.959
YOU AND I GOT TO TALK.

09:52.959 --> 09:54.994
COACH BAKER SAID
YOU WERE ON A BUS
BACK TO NEVADA.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.297
NAH, I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE
TILL I FIGURE OUT
WHY COREY LEFT.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.199
I AIN'T GOT NOTHIN'
FOR YOU, MAN.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.700
NAH, I THINK YOU DO.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.769
IN FACT, I THINK YOU GOT
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.271
YOU GOT TWO SECONDS
TO GET YOUR HANDS
OFF ME, HOMIE.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.807
I TOLD YOU, I AIN'T
GOT NO ANSWERS
FOR YOU, A'IGHT?

10:07.807 --> 10:09.676
YOU EXPECT ME TO
BELIEVE HE JUST LEFT?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.377
NO REASON,
NO EXPLANATION?

10:11.377 --> 10:13.313
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.281
BOTH OF Y'ALL CAN GO
TO HELL FOR ALL I CARE.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.117
YOU MUST HAVE DID
SOMETHING TO RUN HIM OFF.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.419
ADMIT IT.
YOUR LITTLE BITCH ASS
MUST HAVE DID OR SAID

10:19.419 --> 10:21.721
SOMETHING 'CAUSE YOU
COULDN'T STAND THE FACT
THAT I'M MORE OF A SON

10:21.721 --> 10:23.223
TO HIM THAN YOU
WILL EVER BE.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.898
SPENCER: YO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF ME NOW, DAWG?

10:31.898 --> 10:34.200
HUH?

10:34.200 --> 10:36.336
HEY, HEY!
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!

10:36.336 --> 10:39.873
SPENCER: GET OFF!
GET OFF! COME ON, DAWG!

10:39.873 --> 10:41.941
WHAT'S UP? GET OFF ME!

10:41.941 --> 10:45.078
WHAT'S UP, MAN?!
WHAT'S UP?!

10:58.958 --> 11:00.727
SPENCER:
YOU CALLED YOUR DAD?

11:00.727 --> 11:02.195
BE DAMN GRATEFUL I DID.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.364
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.734
CLIFF: NO, NO, NO.
NOT YOU, SPENCER.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.836
TAKE A SEAT.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.176
TALKED
PRINCIPAL LONDON DOWN.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.945
WASN'T EASY,

11:18.945 --> 11:23.082
SO NOW, YOU'RE GONNA
RETURN THE FAVOR.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.155
LAURA: YEAH, I'M ALREADY
ON MY WAY. I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.258
OH. HEY.

11:32.258 --> 11:34.227
UH, SORRY.
I WON'T KEEP YOU.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.930
I JUST WANTED
TO DROP OFF THESE
GIFTS FOR THE, UH,

11:36.930 --> 11:39.132
FOR THE KIDS
FOR THE PARTY.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.534
THE PARTY WAS
CANCELED, BILLY.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.836
CANCELED? WHY?

11:43.836 --> 11:48.207
YOU DO REMEMBER THE
WHOLE JORDAN CRASHING
OLIVIA'S CAR THING,

11:48.207 --> 11:50.910
CAR THAT YOU LET HIM
DRIVE, EVEN THOUGH YOU
KNEW HE WAS GROUNDED?

11:50.910 --> 11:53.079
YEAH, I KNOW THAT
THAT WAS MY MISTAKE,

11:53.079 --> 11:55.882
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
YOU'RE BEING
A LITTLE EXTREME?

11:55.882 --> 11:58.885
HEY, AND I--WHAT I
MEAN TO SAY IS THAT,

11:58.885 --> 12:01.387
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON BETWEEN US,
YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK

12:01.387 --> 12:05.058
IT WOULD BE GOOD
IF THE KIDS FELT, UH,
I DON'T KNOW, CELEBRATED.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.161
THE KIDS NEED STRUCTURE
AND DISCIPLINE

12:08.161 --> 12:11.264
AND DEPENDABLE RULES,
NOT A PARTY.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.266
I'M NOT SAYING THEY
DON'T NEED DISCIPLINE--

12:13.266 --> 12:16.803
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I--I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO ARGUE RIGHT NOW, OK?

12:16.803 --> 12:20.173
I JUST NEED YOU
TO BACK ME UP THIS TIME.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.108
YEAH. OK.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.153
HELLO?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.527
HEY.

12:41.527 --> 12:45.999
I TOLD YOU, DAY ONE,
FIGHTING ON CAMPUS--
COULD GET EXPELLED.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.567
IT WAS NOTHING.
IT'S TAKEN CARE OF--

12:47.567 --> 12:50.403
SPENCER, THERE IS NOTHING
CLIFF MOSLEY DOES FOR FREE.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.405
LOOK, THE PRICE IS
JUST DINNER, A'IGHT?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.974
WHICH I GOT TO GET
DRESSED FOR.
EXCUSE ME.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.342
WELL, THEN YOU
AIN'T GOING.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.511
I'VE SEEN THIS CAT
MANIPULATE YOUNG MEN

12:58.511 --> 13:01.347
WITH HIS LITTLE
FATHER FIGURE ACT
TOO MANY TIMES TO LET YOU--

13:01.347 --> 13:03.449
I'M ONLY GOING 'CAUSE I
DON'T HAVE A CHOICE,

13:03.449 --> 13:05.952
BUT I'M NOT ABOUT
TO WALK IN THERE
ALL DOE-EYED

13:05.952 --> 13:09.322
AND DO WHAT HE WANTS
JUST 'CAUSE HE ACT
LIKE MY DADDY, A'IGHT?

13:11.924 --> 13:13.359
HEY.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.863
ARE WE DONE?

13:28.608 --> 13:31.110
THAT'S HOW YOU BREAK.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.113
- OOH.
- THANK YOU.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.115
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE,
BUT YOU REALLY DIDN'T NEED

13:36.115 --> 13:39.052
TO RUSH ALL THE WAY
FROM TOKYO. I'M FINE.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.054
DIDN'T SOUND LIKE IT,

13:41.054 --> 13:43.222
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO TALK TO A THERAPIST

13:43.222 --> 13:45.992
ONCE WE FIND
THE RIGHT ONE.
THAT'S THE DEAL.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.561
FINE...

13:48.561 --> 13:52.198
UM, BUT I ACTUALLY
CAN'T TONIGHT. I HAVE
A SCHOOL PROJECT.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.233
YOU'RE NOT PUTTING
THIS OFF, LAYLA.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.169
NO, I'M NOT.
IT'S JUST IT'S THE
ONLY NIGHT THAT WORKED

13:56.169 --> 13:59.038
FOR JJ AND, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'D TOLD ME YOU

13:59.038 --> 14:02.442
WERE COMING BACK
INTO TOWN, I COULD HAVE
CLEARED MY SCHEDULE.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.377
- JJ.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.381
WHAT'S UP?
WELCOME HOME, MR. KEATING.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.016
- HEY.
- JJ, WE SHOULD REALLY

14:10.016 --> 14:12.652
START WORKING ON OUR
SOCIOLOGY PROJECT,

14:12.652 --> 14:14.353
IF THAT'S OK
WITH YOU?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.022
OH, HELL YEAH.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.391
YEAH. OK, BYE, DAD.
LOVE YOU.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.193
LOVE YOU.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.496
JJ: UM, WE DON'T REALLY
HAVE A PROJECT,

14:23.496 --> 14:25.498
DO WE? 'CAUSE I
DO NOT REMEMBER THAT.

14:25.498 --> 14:29.502
NO, NOT A SCHOOL ONE,
ANYWAY, BUT HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT HOSTING

14:29.502 --> 14:32.205
THE BAKER TWINS
A SURPRISE PARTY
AT YOUR HOUSE?

14:32.205 --> 14:34.207
- HELL YEAH.
- OK, TONIGHT,

14:34.207 --> 14:36.209
UH, YOU MAKE SURE
JORDAN AND OLIVIA
ARE THERE.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.710
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING ELSE.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.346
- I WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

14:44.183 --> 14:47.086
SO, DO YOU WANT TO PLAY
A GAME OR SOMETHING?

14:47.086 --> 14:49.388
WHAT? I GET BORED
WALKING HOME, LIV.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.224
OH, AND WHOSE
FAULT IS IT THAT
WE'RE WALKING?

14:51.224 --> 14:53.126
OK, LOOK, I ALREADY LOST
MY CAR, PHONE, AND BIRTHDAY.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.061
I DON'T NEED
THE ATTITUDE AS WELL.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.497
WELL, CONSIDERING
I LOST MY CAR, PHONE,
AND BIRTHDAY BECAUSE

14:57.497 --> 15:01.200
OF YOUR ATTITUDE,
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO LIVE WITH WHAT--WHOA!

15:01.200 --> 15:05.304
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT--JJ?

15:05.304 --> 15:07.273
- WHAT THE HELL?
- WHO'S JJ?

15:07.273 --> 15:09.008
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--
AAH! AAH!

15:09.008 --> 15:10.143
GET THIS THING OFF
MY HEAD, DUDE!

15:10.143 --> 15:11.611
WHAT'S GOING ON?
SO NOT FUNNY, OK?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.112
AAH! WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU TAKING US?!

15:13.112 --> 15:15.915
IT'S A SURPRISE!
HA HA!

15:20.650 --> 15:22.550
OLIVIA: JJ, TAKE
THIS BLINDFOLD OFF

15:22.550 --> 15:23.850
BEFORE I WHIP THE BLOND
OUT OF YOUR HAIR.

15:23.850 --> 15:25.550
DUDE, FOR REAL, OK?
MY MOM'S GONNA KILL US

15:25.550 --> 15:26.690
IF SHE FINDS
THAT WE'RE NOT HOME.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.690
WHICH IS WHY I
KIDNAPPED YOU.

15:28.690 --> 15:30.990
INTENT IS 90% OF THE LAW.

15:30.990 --> 15:33.630
THERE'S NO PUNISHMENT
IF THERE'S NO INTENT
TO PARTY.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.530
NOT YOUR WORST IDEA.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.130
PARTY?

15:37.130 --> 15:39.600
ALL: SURPRISE!

15:41.540 --> 15:43.710
HEY, SHE WAS RIGHT.
WE COULDN'T LET
THE BAKER TWINS'

15:43.710 --> 15:45.410
B-DAY GO
UN-CELEBRATED.

15:45.410 --> 15:46.410
SHE WHO?

15:46.410 --> 15:49.180
LAYLA: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BAKERS!

15:49.180 --> 15:51.580
GRAB A SHOT!

15:51.580 --> 15:54.850
AND SELTZER FOR LIV,
OF COURSE.

15:54.850 --> 15:56.550
COME ON.

15:56.550 --> 15:57.950
CHEERS.

15:57.950 --> 15:59.790
WHOO!

16:09.600 --> 16:12.830
CLIFF: OH, WELL,
YOU CLEAN UP NICE, SON.

16:16.540 --> 16:19.210
BILLY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.010
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
CLIFFY?

16:21.010 --> 16:22.880
FIGURED IT SHOULDN'T
BE A PROBLEM SINCE
THERE'S NOTHING

16:22.880 --> 16:24.850
YOU'D BE TALKING
TO MY STAR PLAYER ABOUT

16:24.850 --> 16:26.550
THAT YOU COULDN'T SAY
IN FRONT OF ME.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.620
I MEAN, RIGHT?

16:28.620 --> 16:30.620
PLUS, I LOVE ME
SOME LOBSTER TAIL

16:30.620 --> 16:32.850
IN THERMIDOR SAUCE,
OK? HA HA HA!

16:32.850 --> 16:36.190
WELL, I HOPE YOU
BROUGHT YOUR APPETITE

16:36.190 --> 16:39.490
'CAUSE THIS PLACE HAS
THE BEST LOBSTER IN L.A.

16:39.490 --> 16:42.460
MY GRAMPS TOLD ME
LOBSTERS WERE THE
COCKROACHES OF THE SEA.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.470
I DON'T EAT
BOTTOM FEEDERS.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.600
OH, THIS IS
GONNA BE FUN.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.910
OLIVIA: OK, YOU DON'T
ACTUALLY BELIEVE

16:50.910 --> 16:53.070
JJ's "INTENT TO PARTY"
CRAP, RIGHT?

16:53.070 --> 16:55.080
NO, 'COURSE NOT, OK,
BUT MOM'S GOT

16:55.080 --> 16:57.780
THAT CAMPAIGN THING
UNTIL LATE TONIGHT,
SO WE'RE GOOD.

16:57.780 --> 17:00.550
YOU KNOW, FEEL FREE
TO BOUNCE IF YOU'RE
SO WORRIED.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.880
HOW HAVE YOU MISSED
THE PART WHERE I'M
CONSTANTLY BEING

17:02.880 --> 17:05.650
PUNISHED EVERY TIME
YOU BREAK THE RULES?

17:05.650 --> 17:09.090
JORDAN. JORDAN?

17:09.090 --> 17:12.230
UH, IT--IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ME.

17:12.230 --> 17:17.130
IT'S JUST I KINDA
SORTA HOOKED UP
WITH ALL 3 OF THEM...

17:17.130 --> 17:19.030
SEPARATELY.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.900
IT'S JUST,
NOW THEY'RE TOGETHER,
IT'S FREAKING ME OUT.

17:21.900 --> 17:25.640
OLIVIA: WOW, YOU'VE REALLY
LEANED INTO THIS ...
SITUATION, HAVEN'T YOU?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.510
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M
CHEATING, ALL RIGHT?

17:27.510 --> 17:30.110
I'VE BEEN TOTALLY HONEST
WITH ALL OF THEM.
IT'S JUST SIMONE,

17:30.110 --> 17:33.520
THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE,
SHE'S BEEN ACTING
A LITTLE CLINGY LATELY.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.880
HEY, LISTEN UP,
BITCHES!

17:34.880 --> 17:37.290
IT'S TIME FOR HIDE
AND GO GET IT!

17:37.290 --> 17:38.720
ALL: WHOO!

17:38.720 --> 17:40.720
JJ: OK, THE RULES
ARE SIMPLE.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.720
GUYS, HIDE ANYWHERE
IN THE HOUSE.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.830
GIRLS, TRY
AND FIND US.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.660
SO IT'S LIKE
HIDE AND GO SEEK?

17:46.660 --> 17:49.200
WELL, EXCEPT IF YOU
GET FOUND, YOU HAVE
TO, YOU KNOW,

17:49.200 --> 17:50.700
get it on.

17:50.700 --> 17:51.630
JJ: HA HA HA!

17:51.630 --> 17:54.100

17:55.100 --> 17:56.810
OH, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP.
INCOMING.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.840
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:58.840 --> 18:01.810
HE DOES KNOW HE'S NOT
INVISIBLE, RIGHT?

18:06.280 --> 18:07.980
LAURA: JORDAN?

18:07.980 --> 18:10.790
OLIVIA...

18:10.790 --> 18:13.790
I KNOW I SAID YOUR
BIRTHDAY WAS CANCELED,

18:13.790 --> 18:18.990
BUT...EVEN I CAN ADMIT
WHEN I'M BEING HARSH,

18:18.990 --> 18:20.930
SORT OF.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.300
JORDAN.

18:24.300 --> 18:27.240
LIV?

18:36.580 --> 18:38.680
♪ OH, YEAH ♪

18:38.680 --> 18:40.650
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.250
YOU DOING ALL RIGHT,
BIRTHDAY GIRL?

18:43.250 --> 18:45.050
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

18:45.050 --> 18:47.590
JJ: ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
RAISE YOUR DRINKS.

18:47.590 --> 18:50.660
ALL OF YOU KIDS CAME
FOR HIDE AND GO GET IT,

18:50.660 --> 18:52.760
SAY, "HELL YEAH!"

18:52.760 --> 18:54.900
ALL: HELL YEAH! WHOO!

18:55.960 --> 18:58.370
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
LET'S GO.

18:58.370 --> 19:01.240
CLIFF: I'M TALKING
ABOUT BUILDING
THE BEVERLY EAGLES

19:01.240 --> 19:04.310
INTO THE NEXT POWERHOUSE
IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL,

19:04.310 --> 19:07.640
AND IT ALL BEGINS
WITH OUR FRANCHISE STAR.
THAT'S YOU, SON.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.280
YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE MOST TALKED-ABOUT

19:09.280 --> 19:12.180
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
RECRUIT IN THE COUNTRY.

19:12.180 --> 19:14.720
I WANT YOU ON THE COVER
OF "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,"

19:14.720 --> 19:16.790
AND I GOT THE CONNECTIONS
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

19:16.790 --> 19:19.750
DEPENDS ON HOW MANY
OF THESE DINNERS I GOT
TO SIT THROUGH.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.390
- AHEM.
- THE BEST WAY TO BUILD

19:21.390 --> 19:23.960
BEVERLY'S REP
IS BY RAISING
SPENCER'S PROFILE,

19:23.960 --> 19:26.690
SHOWING THAT
THE EAGLES DON'T
JUST WIN TITLES.

19:26.690 --> 19:29.660
WE KNOW HOW TO
PUT OUR PLAYERS ON
THE PATH TO STARDOM.

19:29.660 --> 19:31.700
SO YOU WANT TO RUN
BEVERLY FOOTBALL

19:31.700 --> 19:33.300
LIKE A DIVISION 1
COLLEGE PROGRAM?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.000
THAT'S THE FUTURE.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.070
RIGHT.

19:36.070 --> 19:39.010
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,
SUPERSTAR?

19:39.010 --> 19:41.380
- SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.
- IT IS.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.910
THERE'LL BE PRESS,
OFF-SEASON EXHIBITIONS.

19:43.910 --> 19:46.820
AND I GOT TO KEEP WINNING
CHAMPIONSHIPS, OF COURSE,

19:46.820 --> 19:49.250
IN ADDITION TO ALL
THAT OTHER STUFF,

19:49.250 --> 19:52.750
SO YOU AND THE EAGLES KEEP
WINNING EVEN AFTER I'M GONE.

19:52.750 --> 19:53.990
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:53.990 --> 19:57.730
AND YOU'RE NOT
OFFERING ME ANY MONEY?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.730
'COURSE NOT.

19:59.730 --> 20:02.800
SOUNDS LIKE THAT
PLANTATION LIFE,
MR. MOSLEY.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.730
EXCUSE ME?

20:04.730 --> 20:07.040
SPENCER: I SAID...

20:07.040 --> 20:10.670
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU WANT ME TO
BE YOUR SLAVE,

20:10.670 --> 20:12.440
AND MY ANSWER
IS HELL NO.

20:12.440 --> 20:15.740
CLIFF: THE HELL DO YOU
THINK YOU TALKING TO, HUH?

20:15.740 --> 20:17.250
YOU GONNA WALK OUT ON ME?

20:17.250 --> 20:18.950
BILLY: EASY, CLIFF.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.490
HEY, YOU WANT
A DRINK?

20:30.490 --> 20:32.030
MORE FOR ME.

20:36.200 --> 20:37.470
SORRY.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.910
LOOKING FOR
THE BATHROOM, NOT--

20:43.910 --> 20:45.540
HEY THERE,
BIRTHDAY GIRL.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.940
- OH, HELL NO.
- OH, WAIT!

20:48.510 --> 20:50.250
I'D SKIP THAT ONE.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.480
BOY: COME ON, LIV!

21:00.090 --> 21:02.630
JORDAN: SORRY.
ALREADY GETTING GOT.

21:02.630 --> 21:03.960
GOOD FOR YOU,

21:03.960 --> 21:06.660
BUT I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU, JORDAN BAKER.

21:06.660 --> 21:10.100
OHH. HI, SIMONE.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.800
YEAH, IF YOU JUST
GIVE ME A SECOND,

21:11.800 --> 21:13.540
I CAN FIND YOU LATER.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.570
NO, IT'S COOL.
I'LL WAIT.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.100
NOT LIKING
YOUR PARTY, LIV?

21:44.670 --> 21:45.670
WELL, I CAN'T LEAVE
THE KITCHEN

21:45.670 --> 21:47.040
BECAUSE IT'S
THE ONLY PLACE

21:47.040 --> 21:49.340
NO ONE'S TRYING TO
MAKE OUT WITH ME.

21:49.340 --> 21:50.940
IT'S PURGATORY.

21:50.940 --> 21:53.640
TOO BAD SPENCER
HASN'T SHOWN UP.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.980
WHAT?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.950
WELL, HE'S
SINGLE NOW,

21:56.950 --> 21:59.010
AND HIDE AND GO GET IT
WOULD BE THE PERFECT CHANCE

21:59.010 --> 22:00.650
FOR YOU TO MAKE
YOUR MOVE.

22:00.650 --> 22:02.590
ALTHOUGH IF HE
CAME IN AND SAW YOU

22:02.590 --> 22:04.820
ALONE WITH ALL THIS
BOOZE, HE MIGHT TRY TO

22:04.820 --> 22:06.890
SEND YOU BACK TO REHAB.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.630
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

22:09.630 --> 22:11.290
I DON'T KNOW, LIV.

22:11.290 --> 22:14.060
MAYBE I'M PISSED THAT
MY SO-CALLED BEST FRIEND

22:14.060 --> 22:16.600
AND EX TRIED TO
AMBUSH ME

22:16.600 --> 22:18.200
WITH A FAKE
FAMILY REUNION

22:18.200 --> 22:19.670
AND A CRAZY DOCTOR.

22:19.670 --> 22:22.040
AND SO WHAT?
THIS PARTY'S WHAT?
PAYBACK?

22:22.040 --> 22:23.910
WHAT'S THE PLAN?
YOU GONNA POISON
MY SELTZER

22:23.910 --> 22:25.840
OR DANCE ME TO DEATH?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.080
WE WERE JUST
TRYING TO HELP

22:27.080 --> 22:28.740
BECAUSE WE CARE
ABOUT YOU, LAYLA.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.250
IS THAT WHY
SPENCER GHOSTED

22:30.250 --> 22:31.810
AFTER THE INTERVENTION
DIDN'T GO HIS WAY,

22:31.810 --> 22:33.250
'CAUSE HE CARES?

22:33.250 --> 22:35.150
WOW!
HIS DAD LEFT AGAIN

22:35.150 --> 22:37.590
AND YOU'RE PISSED
THAT HE DIDN'T
TEXT YOU.

22:39.620 --> 22:41.690
WHAT? COREY LEFT
TOWN AGAIN?

22:41.690 --> 22:42.830
YEAH. HE LOST
BOTH OF YOU

22:42.830 --> 22:46.030
IN LESS THAN
24 HOURS.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.030
BUT HEY, WHAT
DO YOU CARE?

22:48.030 --> 22:49.800
'CAUSE HE DESERVES
THE PAIN FOR

22:49.800 --> 22:52.230
ACTUALLY DARING TO CARE
ABOUT YOU, RIGHT?

22:54.700 --> 22:56.040
I CAN'T DO THIS
RIGHT NOW.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.590
SPENCER, LET ME
TAKE YOU HOME.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.790
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
GOING HOME.

23:14.790 --> 23:15.890
PARTYING WITH
YOUR EX

23:15.890 --> 23:17.290
WHILE YOU'RE IN
SELF-DESTRUCT MODE

23:17.290 --> 23:19.090
IS NOT GONNA
END WELL.

23:19.090 --> 23:20.760
LOOK, IF YOU'RE
NOT READY TO FACE

23:20.760 --> 23:21.800
WHATEVER'S AT HOME,
WE CAN

23:21.800 --> 23:23.800
GO SOMEWHERE
AND TALK.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.840
I HAPPEN TO BE
WELL-VERSED ON

23:25.840 --> 23:27.940
THE TOPIC OF
COMPLEX FATHER FIGURES.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.780
FIRST TIME
MY POPS LEFT,

23:41.780 --> 23:43.390
I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT
WONDERING WHY.

23:46.290 --> 23:48.660
THAT HURT BURNED
A HOLE THROUGH ME
FOR YEARS.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.130
I CAN'T GO THROUGH
THAT AGAIN.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.330
I JUST WANT TO ACCEPT
THAT HE'S A BASTARD

23:55.330 --> 23:56.370
AND MOVE ON.

23:59.300 --> 24:00.340
WHY IS THAT SO HARD?

24:02.270 --> 24:05.980
THE REASON PEOPLE
CLING TO THEIR HATE
SO STUBBORNLY

24:05.980 --> 24:08.710
IS BECAUSE THEY SENSE
ONCE THE HATE IS GONE,

24:08.710 --> 24:10.750
THEY'LL BE FORCED TO
DEAL WITH THE PAIN.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.720
WHAT, ARE YOU
A SHRINK NOW?

24:12.720 --> 24:15.320
I'M SOMEONE WHO READ
A JAMES BALDWIN QUOTE
ON TWITTER.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.220
LOOK, YOU GOTTA
FACE IT, SPENCER.

24:20.220 --> 24:23.360
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT
WHY HE LEFT,

24:23.360 --> 24:26.900
THE PAIN, THE HURT.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.000
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU'LL HEAL AND MOVE ON.

24:31.230 --> 24:33.470
AND IF YOU CAN
FACE YOUR DEMONS,

24:33.470 --> 24:34.700
I CAN, TOO.

24:35.770 --> 24:37.010
WHAT YOU GOTTA FACE?

24:38.240 --> 24:39.980
I LIED TO YOU
WHEN I TOLD YOU

24:39.980 --> 24:41.210
SOMEONE TIPPED OFF
THE SCHOOL

24:41.210 --> 24:43.910
ABOUT YOU LIVING
IN CRENSHAW.

24:43.910 --> 24:47.380
THE CHAMPIONSHIP WAS
NEVER IN JEOPARDY.

24:47.380 --> 24:49.450
I JUST WANTED YOU
FOCUSED ON BEVERLY.

24:51.120 --> 24:52.020
I'M SORRY.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.860
WELL, WHY'D YOU
DO IT?

24:53.860 --> 24:55.760
WAS IT CLIFF?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.790
NO, I JUST KNEW
THAT'S WHAT

24:57.790 --> 24:58.860
HE WOULD WANT.

24:58.860 --> 25:00.830
WHAT HE WOULD WANT.

25:00.830 --> 25:02.200
WHAT ABOUT ME,
ROCHELLE?

25:02.200 --> 25:04.270
MY DAD LOOMS
SO LARGE OVER MY LIFE

25:04.270 --> 25:07.870
THAT I DO THINGS
I'M ASHAMED OF.

25:07.870 --> 25:10.770
I LOSE SIGHT
OF MYSELF.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.910
DON'T LET YOUR DAD
LOOM SO LARGE

25:12.910 --> 25:15.780
THAT YOU LOSE
YOUR POWER

25:15.780 --> 25:17.010
AND YOUR FUTURE.

25:17.010 --> 25:18.280
YEAH, WELL, IT'S
A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT,

25:18.280 --> 25:19.950
GIVEN WHAT JUST
HAPPENED AT DINNER.

25:19.950 --> 25:24.320
YOU FACE YOUR DEMONS,
I'LL HANDLE MY DAD.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.960
I OWE YOU THAT.

25:25.960 --> 25:30.090
MAN: ♪ LAY MY SWEET CARESS... ♪

25:32.430 --> 25:33.860
COME ON.

25:33.860 --> 25:40.370
MAN: ♪ ... ABOVE MY HEAD ... ♪

25:40.370 --> 25:47.380
♪ JUST LEAVE ME HERE,
JUST LEAVE ME HERE ♪

25:47.980 --> 25:54.920
♪ JUST LEAVE ME,
JUST LEAVE ME HERE ♪

26:04.630 --> 26:05.660
JORDAN?
JORDAN, I'M LEAVING.

26:05.660 --> 26:07.400
YOU BETTER BE
IN HERE.

26:08.800 --> 26:10.730
HEY, LIV.

26:10.730 --> 26:12.570
YOU OK?
YOU KINDA JUST
TOOK OFF.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.570
YEAH, I JUST NEED
TO FIND JORDAN

26:14.570 --> 26:15.440
'CAUSE WE
HAVE TO GO.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.510
HEY, LOOK, THAT KISS?

26:18.510 --> 26:21.080
YOU KNOW SHE JUST
DID THAT, RIGHT?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.680
YEAH. YEAH, NO.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.580
SHE WAS JUST USING YOU
TO GET BACK AT SPENCER

26:24.580 --> 26:26.150
OR ME OR BOTH OF US.

26:26.150 --> 26:27.550
I-I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

26:27.550 --> 26:30.990
I MEAN, NOT THAT YOU,
YOU KNOW, KISSING HER,

26:30.990 --> 26:34.390
REALLY, ANYONE WOULD
BE GETTING BACK
AT ME OR WHATEVER.

26:36.190 --> 26:37.760
I NEED TO GO
GET A RIDE,

26:37.760 --> 26:39.630
'CAUSE I THINK
JORDAN LEFT
WITHOUT ME, SO...

26:39.630 --> 26:41.500
BEFORE YOU GO,

26:41.500 --> 26:42.500
I HAVEN'T REALLY
HAD THE CHANCE

26:42.500 --> 26:44.430
TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.540
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

26:53.510 --> 26:55.250
A BURNER PHONE?

26:55.250 --> 26:57.680
LIKE, FOR DRUG DEALERS?

26:57.680 --> 26:59.880
A PREPAID CELL,

26:59.880 --> 27:01.220
LIKE, FOR FRIENDS
WHO HAVE

27:01.220 --> 27:03.120
LOST THEIR
PHONE PRIVILEGES.

27:04.620 --> 27:08.630
I PROGRAMMED IN
YOUR SPONSOR AND ME.

27:08.630 --> 27:10.560
AVAILABLE FOR
ICE CREAM DELIVERIES.

27:15.130 --> 27:18.970
I LOVE IT.
THANK YOU.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.970
- IT'S NO BIG THING.
- YEAH, IT IS.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.540
IT'S MY ONLY GIFT.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.590
LAURA: PARTY'S OVER!

27:35.590 --> 27:37.620
OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S MY MOM.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.100
COOP: YO, BOY.
SPENCER: OH!

27:54.100 --> 27:55.640
COOP: AIN'T EASY TO SHAKE ME.
SPENCER: DAMN!

27:55.640 --> 27:56.870
YO, SHUT UP.

27:56.870 --> 27:58.210
YOU GONNA WAKE
THE WHOLE HOUSE UP.

27:58.210 --> 28:00.010
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING HERE, COOP?

28:00.010 --> 28:01.780
OH, YOU AIN'T
ANSWERED NO TEXTS
OR CALLED BACK.

28:01.780 --> 28:03.010
I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE
A VOICEMAIL.

28:03.010 --> 28:04.720
YOU KNOW I HATE
LEAVING VOICEMAIL.

28:04.720 --> 28:06.120
MY BAD, ALL RIGHT?

28:06.120 --> 28:08.250
I CAN'T LIE TO YOU,
AND I WASN'T READY

28:08.250 --> 28:10.220
TO FACE THE TRUTH.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.250
OK, AND NOW?

28:17.660 --> 28:19.200
CAN YOU?

28:19.200 --> 28:20.230
IT'S FROM MY POPS.

28:24.130 --> 28:25.640
"SPENCER,
I'M SORRY FOR

28:25.640 --> 28:27.100
"DOING THIS
TO YOU AGAIN.

28:27.100 --> 28:30.610
"I KNOW WHAT YOU
MUST BE THINKING,
BUT YOU'RE WRONG.

28:30.610 --> 28:32.080
"I LOVE YOU, SON.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.680
"I WISH IT DIDN'T
HAVE TO BE THIS WAY

28:33.680 --> 28:35.750
"BUT ONE DAY, I HOPE
YOU UNDERSTAND

28:35.750 --> 28:37.880
"WHY I LEFT
THE WAY I DID,

28:37.880 --> 28:41.050
AND MAYBE THAT DAY,
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME. DAD."

28:42.620 --> 28:43.650
HOLD UP.
LET ME SEE THAT.

28:46.090 --> 28:48.660
"ONE DAY, I HOPE
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

28:48.660 --> 28:49.990
WHY I LEFT
THE WAY I DID."

28:49.990 --> 28:52.730
WHY NOT TELL ME NOW?
WHAT'S HE HIDING?

28:52.730 --> 28:53.760
I DON'T KNOW.

28:53.760 --> 28:54.900
I SHOULD'VE TALKED
TO DARNELL

28:54.900 --> 28:57.130
WHEN HE CAME
LOOKING FOR ME.

28:57.130 --> 28:58.840
HE SAID COREY HAD
TO HAVE A REASON.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.300
WE PROBABLY COULD'VE
FIGURED THAT OUT TOGETHER.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.270
OK, COOL, SO, LET'S
GO TALK TO DARNELL.

29:02.270 --> 29:03.740
IT'S MAD LATE, COOP.

29:03.740 --> 29:05.640
HE'D BE HOME.

29:05.640 --> 29:07.780
WE THREW A COUPLE
PUNCHES LAST TIME.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.150
BRO, REALLY?

29:09.150 --> 29:10.650
I'M OUT YOUR ORBIT
FOR ONE DAY

29:10.650 --> 29:12.350
AND YOU BACK
FIGHTING AGAIN?

29:12.350 --> 29:14.580
COME ON, MAN.
I'LL KEEP Y'ALL
IN CHECK.

29:21.730 --> 29:23.630
UH. THE DRIVER
WILL TAKE YOU HOME.

29:23.630 --> 29:26.230
YOU'LL GET YOUR KEYS
BACK IN THE MORNING.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.770
JJ, WHERE IS JORDAN?

29:28.770 --> 29:30.630
UH, HONEST,

29:30.630 --> 29:32.140
I REALLY DON'T KNOW,
MRS. B.

29:32.140 --> 29:34.340
UH, I THINK
HE MIGHT'VE LEFT.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.770
YOU THINK?

29:35.770 --> 29:38.180
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ALL THE ROOMS. AGAIN.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.980
DID MR. KEATING TELL
YOU ABOUT THE PARTY?

29:42.980 --> 29:44.680
NO. I TOLD
HIM ABOUT IT

29:44.680 --> 29:46.650
AFTER LAYLA TEXTED ME
A PICTURE

29:46.650 --> 29:48.890
OF YOU AND JORDAN
PARTYING.

29:48.890 --> 29:50.820
LAYLA. OF COURSE
SHE DID.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.790
MR. KEATING: YOU'RE COMING NOW!
LAYLA: LET GO OF ME!

29:52.790 --> 29:53.960
I'M NOT LEAVING!

29:53.960 --> 29:54.990
MR. KEATING: THIS IS
NOT A DISCUSSION, OK?

29:54.990 --> 29:56.230
YOU LIED
TO ME, LAYLA.

29:56.230 --> 29:57.730
LOOK WHO DECIDED
TO PLAY DADDY NOW.

29:57.730 --> 29:59.160
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.830
ENOUGH, ALL RIGHT?

30:00.830 --> 30:01.800
YOU'RE COMING HOME
WITH ME NOW.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.730
WHAT HOME?
THE GLASS CASTLE

30:03.730 --> 30:04.770
THAT WAS BROKEN INTO

30:04.770 --> 30:05.940
OR THE HOTEL ROOM

30:05.940 --> 30:07.140
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

30:07.140 --> 30:08.210
UNTIL YESTERDAY?

30:08.210 --> 30:09.710
WE CAN TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER, OK?

30:09.710 --> 30:11.710
NO, DON'T YOU
GET IT?

30:11.710 --> 30:13.710
I DON'T HAVE
A HOME.

30:13.710 --> 30:16.980
I DON'T HAVE SOMEWHERE
WHERE I FEEL SAFE.

30:16.980 --> 30:19.850
ALL I HAVE ARE MEMORIES
OF A MOM I LOST

30:19.850 --> 30:21.380
AND EVEN LESS MEMORIES
OF A FATHER

30:21.380 --> 30:23.150
WHO ABANDONED ME.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.790
SWEETHEART, I DON'T
THINK THAT THIS
IS THE TIME--

30:24.790 --> 30:26.960
I'M SORRY.
WHO ASKED YOU
TO GET INVOLVED?

30:26.960 --> 30:29.230
MAYBE GO FIX
YOUR OWN BROKEN FAMILY.

30:29.230 --> 30:30.860
HONEY.

30:36.270 --> 30:38.070
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
MY FRIEND.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.640
MY REAL FAMILY.

30:43.770 --> 30:46.110
AND YOU BETRAYED ME.

30:46.110 --> 30:47.910
YOU WANT TO BRING
MY DAD BACK

30:47.910 --> 30:51.250
SO YOU CAN TELL HIM
I'M BROKEN?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.020
MAYBE I AM.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.350
GUESS WHO BROKE ME.

30:55.350 --> 30:56.490
YOU DON'T
MEAN IT.

30:56.490 --> 30:57.790
LAYLA...

30:57.790 --> 31:00.120
DON'T EVER,

31:00.120 --> 31:03.760
EVER SPEAK
TO ME AGAIN.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.060
I'M SORRY.

31:08.870 --> 31:09.900
MR. KEATING: LAYLA.

31:27.220 --> 31:30.020
HEY, MAN, AIN'T NO SIGN
OF DARNELL ANYMORE.

31:30.020 --> 31:32.820
HE MUST'VE WENT TO HIS
AUNT'S IN NEVADA
AFTER ALL.

31:32.820 --> 31:34.320
HE LEFT SOME
MAIL BEHIND.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.960
THAT'S IT.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.870
HEY, YOU DO KNOW
THAT'S A FEDERAL
OFFENSE, RIGHT?

31:48.870 --> 31:51.410
WHATEVER. I'M JUST
PUTTING IT OUT THERE.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.810
AMR GENETIC TESTING
AND DIAGNOSTICS LAB.

31:54.810 --> 31:56.110
THAT SOUND LIKE
THAT 23 AND ME.

31:56.110 --> 31:58.350
A COMPLETE
WASTE OF MONEY,
BY THE WAY.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.420
ARE YOU GOOD, BRO?

32:02.420 --> 32:04.120
WHAT? YOU THINK
THIS GOT SOMETHING
TO DO WITH DARNELL?

32:07.920 --> 32:09.290
NO.

32:10.430 --> 32:12.260
I THINK IT'S GOT TO DO
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

32:22.510 --> 32:23.910
JORDAN.

32:23.910 --> 32:25.940
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
IT'S LATE.

32:25.940 --> 32:29.450
I KNOW.
JUST, UH...

32:29.450 --> 32:31.010
I JUST NEEDED, UH...

32:32.920 --> 32:35.420
I REALLY
MESSED UP, DAD.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.990
WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:41.560 --> 32:44.160
YOU BEEN DRINKING.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.530
YEAH. BUT I'M-I'M
NOT DRUNK.

32:46.530 --> 32:48.000
OK? I PROMISE.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.030
YOUR MOTHER
HAS NO IDEA

32:49.030 --> 32:51.130
WHERE YOU ARE,
DOES SHE?

32:51.130 --> 32:53.070
OF COURSE NOT.
COME ON.

32:53.070 --> 32:54.370
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
PLEASE, PLEASE, NO.

32:54.370 --> 32:55.370
CAN WE TALK FIRST?

32:55.370 --> 32:56.540
NO, WE CAN'T TALK.

32:56.540 --> 32:57.910
YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.

32:57.910 --> 32:59.210
YOU ARE OUT OF CONTROL
AND I CAN'T KEEP

32:59.210 --> 33:01.140
LETTING YOU TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF ME

33:01.140 --> 33:02.610
BECAUSE I FEEL GUILTY.

33:02.610 --> 33:04.250
DAD, I GOT A GIRL PREGNANT.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.480
I'M SO SORRY.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.220
I WAS AT THIS PARTY TODAY
AND THIS GIRL SIMONE,
SHE TOLD ME.

33:11.220 --> 33:13.390
I-I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.060
I'M...I'M SORRY.

33:18.060 --> 33:20.300
- OK.
- I REALLY, REALLY MESSED UP.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.130
IT'S OK.

33:21.130 --> 33:22.500
ALL RIGHT?
LOOK AT ME.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.270
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE
THIS OUT TOGETHER.

33:24.270 --> 33:26.070
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

33:26.070 --> 33:27.370
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WE'RE GONNA FIGURE THIS

33:27.370 --> 33:29.210
OUT TOGETHER, OK?

33:29.210 --> 33:30.870
WE'RE GONNA FIGURE THIS
OUT TOGETHER.

33:32.940 --> 33:33.980
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

33:46.290 --> 33:48.330
NO, JORDAN.

33:48.330 --> 33:50.360
I'VE BEEN WAITING
ALL NIGHT.

33:52.860 --> 33:54.630
WHAT IS GOING ON?

33:54.630 --> 33:56.730
BILLY: WHY DON'T YOU GO
UPSTAIRS, JORDAN.

33:56.730 --> 33:58.200
YOUR MOTHER AND I
NEED TO TALK.

34:03.310 --> 34:05.640
WHY ARE YOUR SUITCASES
IN MY HOUSE, BILLY?

34:05.640 --> 34:07.340
YOU'RE RIGHT.
MY CHILDREN

34:07.340 --> 34:10.210
DO NEED STRUCTURE
AND DISCIPLINE,

34:10.210 --> 34:11.980
BUT THEY NEED THE BEST
OUT OF BOTH OF US,

34:11.980 --> 34:13.350
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO DO THAT

34:13.350 --> 34:15.390
WHEN I'M SLEEPING
ACROSS THE 10.

34:15.390 --> 34:16.690
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.360
NO, BILLY,
YOU ARE NOT

34:19.360 --> 34:20.960
MOVING BACK
INTO THE HOUSE.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.360
I'VE GOT IT HANDLED.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.290
OH, DO YOU?
YOU HAVE IT HANDLED?

34:23.290 --> 34:24.860
-YES.
-BECAUSE JORDAN HAS

34:24.860 --> 34:25.930
GOT A GIRL PREGNANT.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.270
WHAT?

34:29.270 --> 34:31.440
MM-HMM. PREGNANT.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.590
SO...WHO'S WAITING

34:52.590 --> 34:55.830
FOR THE NEWEST
"OORT SENTRY"?

34:55.830 --> 34:57.460
I'M GOOD.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.530
A'IGHT. I'LL READ IT
BY MYSELF.

35:08.610 --> 35:10.270
HEY, WHAT'S
A JAYSTONIAN?

35:10.270 --> 35:11.540
A PERSON FROM JAYSTONE.

35:11.540 --> 35:13.580
NAH. OK.
AND IS IT BAD

35:13.580 --> 35:14.650
THAT HEROES
ARE LYING...

35:14.650 --> 35:16.380
- AAH!
- WHAT? WHAT?

35:16.380 --> 35:17.610
SPOILERS, SPENCER!

35:17.610 --> 35:19.280
BUT I NEED YOU TO
HELP ME REMEMBER

35:19.280 --> 35:20.520
WHAT'S GOING ON,
LITTLE MAN.

35:26.460 --> 35:30.430
ALL RIGHT.
ARIELENA AND HARROW.

35:30.430 --> 35:32.800
ALL RIGHT...AHEM.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.800
SO, THEY'RE
BOTH JAYSTONIANS.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.770
- MM-HMM.
- BUT THEY HAVEN'T RETURNED

35:36.770 --> 35:40.440
TO THEIR HOME WORLD
SINCE THEY

35:40.440 --> 35:43.370
BROKE THE OATH
FROM THE Q?

35:43.370 --> 35:47.680
NO WAY.
THAT'S, LIKE, A BIG ...

36:07.500 --> 36:08.970
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

36:10.370 --> 36:12.500
IT'S DR. GURMAN'S
OFFICE.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.040
YOUR APPOINTMENT
STARTS IN 5.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.540
DAD, I WAS DRUNK

36:17.540 --> 36:19.110
AT A PARTY
AND MADE A SCENE.

36:19.110 --> 36:22.450
- IT DOESN'T MEAN--
- BUT YOU NEED HELP, LAYLA.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.120
I SHOULD'VE
SEEN THIS COMING

36:26.120 --> 36:28.050
AND DONE
SOMETHING SOONER.

36:28.050 --> 36:29.350
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

36:32.860 --> 36:34.760
YOUR MOM.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.490
SHE SUFFERED
FROM DEPRESSION.

36:41.830 --> 36:44.330
WHY HAVE YOU
NEVER TOLD ME THAT?

36:46.740 --> 36:48.610
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ME?

36:51.510 --> 36:53.340
DEPRESSION CAN BE
HEREDITARY, SWEETIE.

36:55.410 --> 36:58.450
YOU ALWAYS SEEMED
SO STRONG.

36:58.450 --> 36:59.950
I NEVER SAW
ANY SIGNS.

37:01.450 --> 37:02.720
I SHOULD'VE
BEEN THERE.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.490
BUT I AM NOW.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.760
AND I'M GONNA
HELP YOU FACE THIS.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.600
AND IT STARTS WITH
GOING IN THERE.

37:20.900 --> 37:22.370

MOST DELIVERY SERVICES

38:01.010 --> 38:04.550
WAIT FOR THE PERSON
TO ORDER FIRST, RIGHT?

38:04.550 --> 38:06.880
IT'S A BIT UNORTHODOX,
I KNOW.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.750
BUT...I WAS
TIRED OF WAITING.

38:13.660 --> 38:18.600
I REALLY HOPE THIS

AT THE PARTY,

39:16.750 --> 39:18.190
THAT WAS SWEET OF YOU
TO TUCK HIM IN.

39:21.830 --> 39:23.160
MA, I NEED TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

39:25.630 --> 39:26.900
OK.

39:29.570 --> 39:30.830
WHAT ABOUT?

39:32.170 --> 39:33.500
UH...

39:41.610 --> 39:44.680
IT'S A COPAY
FOR A GENETICS
TESTING LAB.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.590
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT'S FOR, BUT I

39:48.590 --> 39:50.020
FOUND IT AT
COREY'S HOUSE.

39:56.960 --> 39:58.500
IS DILLON
COACH BAKER'S SON?

40:02.070 --> 40:04.000
I'M SORRY, MAMA, BUT
THE MATH MAKES SENSE,

40:04.000 --> 40:06.170
AND IT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY
DAD GOT MAD AND LEFT.

40:11.640 --> 40:13.110
I JUST NEED
THE TRUTH, PLEASE.

40:16.150 --> 40:17.780
OK.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.590
THE TRUTH IS...

40:23.650 --> 40:24.650
I DON'T KNOW
IF DILLON IS

40:24.650 --> 40:26.760
BILLY OR COREY'S.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.330
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY
YOUR FATHER LEFT.

40:29.330 --> 40:30.630
HE MADE PEACE WITH IT.

40:30.630 --> 40:31.830
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.000
HE'S THE ONE WHO DECIDED

40:33.000 --> 40:34.630
NOT TO DO
THE PATERNITY TEST.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.610
THEN IT WAS ME.

40:43.910 --> 40:47.610
IF COREY AIN'T LEAVE
BECAUSE OF DILLON,
IT WAS ME.

40:47.610 --> 40:49.050
- OH, HONEY, NO.
- NO, NO.

40:49.050 --> 40:50.780
IF I'D AGREED
TO PLAY FOR HIM,

40:50.780 --> 40:52.620
HE'D STILL BE HERE.

40:52.620 --> 40:53.720
HE SAID HE WAS COOL

40:53.720 --> 40:54.890
WITH ME STAYING
AT BEVERLY,

40:54.890 --> 40:56.650
BUT MAYBE
HE WASN'T RIGHT?

40:56.650 --> 40:57.890
MAYBE HE WASN'T.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.620
WAS IT ALWAYS
JUST ABOUT FOOTBALL?

41:01.790 --> 41:02.830
IS THAT WHY
HE CAME BACK?

41:02.830 --> 41:04.290
WHAT, IT WASN'T
ENOUGH FOR ME

41:04.290 --> 41:05.800
JUST TO BE
HIS SON?

41:07.960 --> 41:09.730
WHY AM I NEVER
ENOUGH, MOM?

41:09.730 --> 41:10.800
NO, HONEY,
YES, YOU ARE.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.700
LISTEN. NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

41:12.700 --> 41:13.970
LISTEN TO ME.
LOOK AT ME.

41:15.870 --> 41:17.670
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHY YOUR FATHER

41:17.670 --> 41:19.740
DID WHAT HE DID.

41:19.740 --> 41:21.780
BUT WHAT I ABSOLUTELY
KNOW FOR SURE

41:21.780 --> 41:23.710
IS THAT YOU
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN

41:23.710 --> 41:25.720
AND ALWAYS WILL BE
MORE THAN ENOUGH.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.080
- NO.
- YES.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.750
DO YOU HEAR ME,
SPENCER JAMES?

41:29.750 --> 41:32.890
ALWAYS! ALWAYS.

41:35.230 --> 41:36.260
COME HERE.

41:38.230 --> 41:39.760
IT'S OK.

41:39.760 --> 41:41.330
- MAMA.
- IT'S OK.

42:14.970 --> 42:16.670
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
