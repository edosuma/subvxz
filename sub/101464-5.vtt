[shudders, sighs]

01:20.538 --> 01:21.706
Oh...

01:22.082 --> 01:22.916
Okay...

01:24.167 --> 01:26.086
-[screams]
-[all scream]

01:26.920 --> 01:29.422
[sighs] Sorry, I stepped on a twig.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.966
-Ugh, come on, man.
-You done gave me a heart attack!

01:32.050 --> 01:34.260
-I should step on you.
-It's okay, Ben.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.721
-We're all on edge.
-And lost.

01:36.805 --> 01:39.015
Yeah, we've been out here for a while now.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.893
Darius, we sure we're still headed
towards the park?

01:41.976 --> 01:43.853
Well, we'd be sure
if I still had my phone,

01:43.937 --> 01:47.774
because it has a GPS, a compass app,
and is also a phone!

01:47.857 --> 01:50.276
Sammy didn't steal your phone!

01:50.360 --> 01:51.820
No one stole your phone!

01:51.903 --> 01:54.322
Can we please stop talking
about the phone?

01:54.405 --> 01:57.033
You guys! You guys, you guys, you guys.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.786
Could you all yell at each other
quieter, please?

01:59.869 --> 02:02.789
My fellow campers, chill!

02:02.872 --> 02:07.794
What we need here is someone who can
make the hard call on what to do next.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.130
Since I'm obviously leadership material...

02:11.172 --> 02:12.715
I'll do this.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.843
And my first decree as leader is

02:14.926 --> 02:19.389
for everyone to stop talking
and just listen to Darius.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.600
-Huh?
-You got us out of camp alive.

02:22.684 --> 02:26.646
Plus, I can blame you
if anybody gets eaten.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.897
Leadership. [chuckles]

02:28.356 --> 02:30.233
So, which way, Darius?

02:34.946 --> 02:39.534
Please, you're just trying to cover up
the fact that you're lost, too, Mr. VIP.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.745
-None of us know where we are.
-I know where we are!

02:43.329 --> 02:44.956
We're by the Carnotaurus paddock!

02:45.039 --> 02:47.083
I thought this place looked familiar.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.919
Am I an excellent leader or what?

02:53.131 --> 02:54.465
I remember the fence.

02:55.758 --> 03:00.096
-The broken, ripped-down fence.
-[Ben panting]

03:00.513 --> 03:04.601
That means... That means Toro
is out here... with us.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.312
Now we have to deal
with the Indominus and Toro.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.899
Hold up. How do you know about Toro?

03:10.982 --> 03:14.193
We all know. Kenji told us, like,
the day after it happened.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.239
In my defense,
me saving you was super cool.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.365
[sighs]

03:19.449 --> 03:21.868
We know this enclosure
is due north of the main park.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.996
So, if we keep going that way,
we'll hit the visitors' center.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.416
We're sure to find Dave and Roxie,
or someone else there in charge.

03:28.499 --> 03:33.338
Yes! Exactly what I was thinking,
as leader, which I am.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.089
Follow me!

03:38.259 --> 03:40.762
I don't think finding an adult
is going to help.

03:40.845 --> 03:44.098
A terrifying, camouflaged dinosaur
trashed our camp.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.600
No way they have a plan for that.

03:45.683 --> 03:49.062
Ben, I know it's scary,
but this is Jurassic World.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.897
Dealing with dinosaurs is what they do.

03:50.980 --> 03:54.442
They didn't deal so well
back at their first park, did they? Hmm?

03:54.525 --> 03:57.278
Everything will be okay. Trust me.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.288
[rumbling]

04:08.539 --> 04:11.125
[growling]

04:13.127 --> 04:15.129
[Roxie] Ugh! This is taking forever!

04:15.213 --> 04:18.591
I know Claire's a busy lady,
but we can't leave the kids alone all day.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.928
Wow, hittin' the first names.
You only do that when you're annoyed.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.680
Of course I'm annoyed, David.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.182
We need to talk to Claire
and get back to the kids ASAP!

04:26.266 --> 04:28.643
But instead, they shove us in here
and just tell us to wait for her,

04:28.726 --> 04:30.937
and then everyone just disappears!

04:31.854 --> 04:33.314
Where'd they go?

04:33.606 --> 04:35.358
Something's going on.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.735
Look, I'm sure Claire--
yeah, that's not gonna work--

04:37.819 --> 04:39.404
Ms. Dearing will get to us when she can.

04:39.696 --> 04:43.408
When? We've been here so long,
someone gave you a birthday card to sign.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.827
All right, the real issue
is that no one else signed it.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.997
That's just sad. Poor... Eddie.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.456
"Dear Eddie,

04:50.540 --> 04:52.917
I don't know you,
but I'm sure you're doing..."

04:53.001 --> 04:56.045
Will you put that down
and help me find a phone or radio?

04:56.129 --> 04:59.465
We have to get ahold of someone,
ideally, Claire Dearing.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.510
Okay, maybe she's hiding so she doesn't
have to sign this card and--

05:02.593 --> 05:04.512
-Are you picking that lock?
-What?

05:04.595 --> 05:06.472
I watched Brooklynn's
"Hacks for When You Lock Yourself

05:06.556 --> 05:07.890
Out of Your Hotel Room" video.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.393
It was actually so good, I subscribed.

05:10.476 --> 05:11.728
Don't tell her.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.939
-Almost.
-[lock clicks]

05:15.064 --> 05:16.232
Ugh, I'm so good.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.817
Mildly impressive.

05:18.776 --> 05:21.029

05:21.112 --> 05:23.156

-[man 2] <i>No! The order is to get--</i>
-[man 3] <i>Save Wu!</i>

05:27.327 --> 05:29.829

05:40.048 --> 05:41.007
[Sammy grunts]

05:43.551 --> 05:47.430
Don't let Brooklynn upset you.
She's just being... Brooklynn.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.649
Yaz, there's something I... [gasps]

05:59.776 --> 06:01.444
[Sammy] The Indominus rex was here.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.364
[Darius] Predators don't kill prey
and then just leave without feeding.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.200
This... this isn't right.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.493
-[low groaning]
-[all gasp]

-[all scream]

06:28.805 --> 06:30.765
[soft growling]

06:32.016 --> 06:33.226
Bumpy!

06:34.310 --> 06:36.437
[chuckles]

06:37.563 --> 06:39.315
And drooly, and smelly.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.359
How do you even know
that's the same dinosaur?

06:41.526 --> 06:42.652
Her big head bump.

06:42.735 --> 06:46.280
Dr. Wu said she's asymmetrical,
but he's wrong that it's bad.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.533
And so what if she is asymmetrical?

06:48.616 --> 06:51.494
There's nothing wrong
with being different, or bumpy,

06:51.577 --> 06:54.664
or getting tired after reading
an overly thrilling book!

06:54.747 --> 06:57.208
And maybe if her parents
had listened to her,

06:57.291 --> 07:00.044
she wouldn't have come here
and gotten attacked!

07:00.795 --> 07:03.089
Are we still talking about the dinosaur?

07:03.172 --> 07:05.299
Feels like we're not still talking
about the dinosaur.

07:05.383 --> 07:09.804
As fun as this reunion is,
shouldn't we keep moving south?

07:09.887 --> 07:12.515
I'm not spending another hour
walking through the jungle,

07:12.598 --> 07:15.017
hoping that we don't
run into that Indominus.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.477
We need a new plan.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.022
Uh, yeah, obviously we need a new plan.

07:20.189 --> 07:22.733
So, I had Darius figure out a new one.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.235
Lay it on us, bro.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.236
Okay.

07:25.319 --> 07:30.241
So, uh... we need to find
somewhere safe close by.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.619
If camp is that way,
and the park is that way...

07:33.703 --> 07:36.873
[gasps] Isn't Dr. Wu's field genetics lab
near here?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.417
You guys went on the tour.
Does this area look familiar?

07:39.750 --> 07:42.670
Um... Yeah. Y-Yeah.

07:42.753 --> 07:45.631
-I think it might be over that way.
-That seems right.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.341
Great! That's where we should go.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.761
There's bound to be an adult there
who can help or tell us what to do.

07:51.012 --> 07:51.846
Right?

07:51.929 --> 07:54.265
-[faint roaring]
-[all gasp]

07:54.348 --> 07:56.809
Fine, whatever! Let's just go to the lab.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.270
As long as we are moving away from that.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.439
[soft growling]

08:01.522 --> 08:02.523
What about Bumpy?

08:02.732 --> 08:04.275
She's a dinosaur, bro.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.027
She belongs out here in the wild.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.613
And she'll just slow us down.
We gotta go now.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.157
[soft growling]

08:26.839 --> 08:28.508
Ugh! [grunts]

08:28.591 --> 08:31.719
We're doing the right thing, yeah?
Going towards the genetics lab?

08:31.802 --> 08:34.847
Or should we have stayed at camp?
Would that have been safer?

08:34.931 --> 08:36.557
How are you so calm about this?

08:36.641 --> 08:41.270
I told you, if someone gets eaten,
I'm not to blame, you are.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.147
Lea-der-ship.

08:43.231 --> 08:47.693
But if I'm leading us the wrong way,
the person getting eaten could be you.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.238
Are you sure
we should be going to the lab?

08:50.321 --> 08:51.239
[screams]

08:51.322 --> 08:52.907
Why are we moving so slowly?

08:53.157 --> 08:54.742
Let's pick it up, people.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.119
Wait.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.454
Guys, where's Ben?

08:59.497 --> 09:01.707
[grunting]

09:02.416 --> 09:04.627
-[soft growling]
-Shh! Shh!

09:04.710 --> 09:06.671
-Come on. Oh!
-[Yasmina clears throat]

09:07.755 --> 09:09.048
Hey!

09:09.257 --> 09:12.426
How's it hangin'... dudes?

09:12.635 --> 09:15.137
Ben, are you hiding Bumpy in that bush?

09:15.304 --> 09:17.348
[soft bellowing]

09:17.431 --> 09:19.725
Nope. That could be anything.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.978
The jungle makes
all sorts of weird noises.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.188
-[soft growling]
-[grunts]

09:25.523 --> 09:27.441
How did she get here?

09:27.525 --> 09:28.901
We don't have time for this!

09:28.985 --> 09:32.238
There are dinosaurs eating people
out here, and Bumpy can't keep up!

09:32.405 --> 09:33.781
She can move faster.

09:33.864 --> 09:36.659
Ankylosauruses run fast. Right, Darius?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.912
When they're fully grown, maybe,
but she's just...

09:41.956 --> 09:42.999
[snoring]

09:43.082 --> 09:46.294
Wow! Yeah, total speed demon.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.712
Say goodbye, Ben.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.839
[groans]

09:54.885 --> 09:55.928
No!

09:56.762 --> 10:00.308
You say hello,
because she is coming with us!

10:00.391 --> 10:02.101
So... there!

10:02.351 --> 10:05.771
Ben, you're not thinking this through.
Bumpy's too slow.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.192
Then... then we'll put her in the van!

10:10.276 --> 10:11.485
[scoffs] What van?

10:11.819 --> 10:12.945
That one!

10:18.659 --> 10:20.786
It's an ACU transport!

10:20.953 --> 10:22.413
Asset containment unit.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.831
Got the tour of their HQ.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.376
Super hardcore dino-trapping
security dudes.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.919
Then where are they?

10:30.796 --> 10:32.465
-Is that a tablet? [grunts]
-[Darius grunts]

10:35.343 --> 10:37.261
[sighs] What did they tell us?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.139
Oh, right. Come on, channel six.

10:40.222 --> 10:42.683
Dave, Roxie! Can y'all hear us?

10:42.767 --> 10:44.810
[static crackles]

10:46.312 --> 10:49.357
And of course this doesn't have
communication enabled.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.525
Because you know what?
Why would it?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.860
If I had my phone--

10:53.152 --> 10:54.612
Enough already!

10:54.695 --> 10:57.365
There are bigger things
going on here than your phone!

10:59.533 --> 11:00.743
[tablet beeping]

11:03.162 --> 11:05.581
There's a map program
with little moving dots on it.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.250
[Darius] They chip all the dinosaurs
electronically to track them.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.461
See? There's us, and there's...

11:12.588 --> 11:15.716
Wait. Here's the Brachiosaurus Grove
on the map,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.469
so why are the Brachiosauruses
way over there?

11:18.677 --> 11:21.889
I think maybe the fences are down.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.141
-At least some of them.
-[Bumpy growls]

11:24.308 --> 11:27.395

11:34.777 --> 11:36.654
-[Bumpy whines]
-[Ben] Guys?

11:37.405 --> 11:38.739
Something's coming this way.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.199
That's weird.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.202
Whatever that is,
it isn't showing up on the tablet.

11:43.285 --> 11:45.746
What kind of dinosaur
wouldn't have a transponder?

11:45.830 --> 11:48.290
I am not in the mood to find out.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.626
-[Bumpy squealing]
-[Ben] Shh! Shh!

11:50.960 --> 11:55.714
-Ben, shut her up!
-[roaring]

11:55.840 --> 11:57.466
[screams] We gotta go now!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.218
-[Brooklynn] Go! Go!
-[Darius] Move!

12:03.806 --> 12:06.517
Wait! Doesn't anyone know
how to drive a van?

12:07.560 --> 12:09.770
No, but we drove gyrospheres, right?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.021
It can't be that different.

12:11.105 --> 12:13.983
The gyrospheres had joysticks
and a Jimmy Fallon tutorial.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.129
It's gaining! Go faster!

12:35.212 --> 12:36.881
-I can't!
-You're in the wrong gear!

12:36.964 --> 12:39.300
-Well, how do I shift gears?
-How should I know?

-It's coming!
-Step on that thing!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.852
-Zigzag!
-Are you signaling?

12:49.935 --> 12:52.563
Can everyone not yell at me
while I'm saving our lives?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.107
[roars]

12:55.858 --> 12:56.859
Drive!

12:57.651 --> 13:00.571

13:25.971 --> 13:28.807
At least we lost Indominus.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.686
-Now... where do we go?
-[Bumpy groans]

13:32.770 --> 13:35.189
How about into the genetics lab?

13:38.734 --> 13:40.110
It's a gift.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.780
[doors hiss]

-[all scream]

13:54.250 --> 13:57.211

13:57.711 --> 14:01.215
[sighs] Not dinosaurs.
You're not dinosaurs.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.884
[sighs] This is the worst birthday ever.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.517
Again, we are so happy we found you.
Things are crazy!

14:11.892 --> 14:14.061
There's a giant camouflaged dinosaur
out there.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.898
Also, regular dinosaurs.
We've been hoping to find someone--

14:17.982 --> 14:20.150
You're sure you closed the door
behind you, right?

14:20.776 --> 14:21.735
Uh...

14:21.819 --> 14:23.404
I think so.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.407
-You think, or you know?
-[Kenji belches]

14:27.741 --> 14:28.659
Sorry?

14:29.326 --> 14:30.953
Did you want it back?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.872
You know what? Doesn't matter.

14:33.247 --> 14:36.500
The dinosaurs got out and no one
bothered to tell me; they just ran.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.211
So, why not? Knock yourself out.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.257
Ugh! There's no dial tone!

14:43.716 --> 14:44.967
The landlines are down.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.970
So is the radio, and cell phone service
keeps cutting out.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.266
But the park obviously has a plan.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.269
So, what's that plan? What do we do?

14:56.270 --> 14:59.273
You're asking me? [laughs]

14:59.982 --> 15:01.191
Asking me?

15:02.985 --> 15:05.696
Is that, like, a good freaky laugh?

15:06.196 --> 15:08.657
Do you not get it? We're doomed.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.826
No one is coming to help!

15:12.536 --> 15:14.121
But what about Dr. Wu, or--

15:14.330 --> 15:16.707
Wu? Who do you think is to blame?

15:16.790 --> 15:17.833
Wu got greedy.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.045
And instead of dinosaurs,
he built monsters!

15:21.420 --> 15:22.963
[whirring]

15:28.427 --> 15:30.429
Masrani, Dearing,

15:30.512 --> 15:33.766
they're all clueless
about what's really going on here.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.976
And after everything I did
for the other guys--

15:36.268 --> 15:38.103
Other guys? What other--

15:38.187 --> 15:39.480
It doesn't matter, does it?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.732
Jurassic World isn't a park.

15:41.815 --> 15:46.278
It's a powder keg,
and it is detonating all around us!

15:46.362 --> 15:48.530
We're all going down.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.990
End of story!

15:50.240 --> 15:52.534
No, you have to know what to do.

15:53.035 --> 15:53.953
You're an adult!

15:54.161 --> 15:55.663
Don't look at me.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.165
I was just hiding until you all barged in.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.334
But we drove all the way here 'cause--

16:00.542 --> 16:01.543
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:01.710 --> 16:04.421
-You have a vehicle?
-[grunts]

16:05.756 --> 16:08.300
Guys, I left the keys in the van.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.139
Stop! What are you doing?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.059
Getting out of here alive!

Perfect! The park's only intact fence!

-[roaring]
-[all scream, pant]

17:36.263 --> 17:38.265
I told you she'd get in the way!

17:38.348 --> 17:40.768
If it wasn't for her,
I could have made the van.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.438
And then you would have been eaten.
Bumpy saved your life.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.482
Why couldn't you just leave her behind?

17:46.982 --> 17:49.485
Because I won't abandon her like we were!
