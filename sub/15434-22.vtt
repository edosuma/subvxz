00:01.600 --> 00:03.590
- twins?
- Congratulations.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.689
During the rescue on the helicopter--
it's all a blur.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.090
I let people believe what they wanted,

00:08.100 --> 00:10.390
that I was a hero,but I'm not.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.290
Kevin, I just got a registered
letter from the army.

00:12.300 --> 00:14.790
- What does it say, justin?
- They want me back.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.790
How's rebecca?

00:15.800 --> 00:18.390
Saul just told me that you
have been keeping her.

00:18.404 --> 00:19.290
You didn't know?

00:19.304 --> 00:22.292
And what does sarah think
of your hospitality?

00:22.301 --> 00:23.998
it's not even about the kiss anymore.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.892
It's just like we're stuck
in relationship purgatory,

00:26.909 --> 00:28.890
which feels more like relationship hell.

00:28.906 --> 00:29.993
You asked me to marry you,

00:30.007 --> 00:31.790
and now you are completely
taking it back.

00:31.806 --> 00:32.590
I'm not.

00:32.606 --> 00:35.090
I want things to calm down
a little bit with sarah.

00:35.105 --> 00:37.793
My water just broke.They're not ready yet.

00:37.806 --> 00:39.792
Do not push.Do not push.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.090
tommy, here.You really need
to eat something.

01:01.105 --> 01:02.591
I'm not hungry.

01:02.608 --> 01:05.191
God, if we were in L.A.,
I'd have my doctor.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.390
I don't know anybody here.

01:06.406 --> 01:09.793
Parental panic--it'll be with you the rest
of your life,so pace yourself.

01:09.807 --> 01:13.292
you know, my whole life I've been waiting
for this chance to do something heroic.

01:13.305 --> 01:15.893
And I get this opportunity
to save these two babies,

01:15.908 --> 01:17.790
either of which
may be biologically mine.

01:17.808 --> 01:19.993
You know what, uncle saul?
I have nothing.

01:20.005 --> 01:22.290
Justin, however,is trained for this.

01:22.308 --> 01:25.091
- Okay, stop. All right?It wasn't heroic.
- It was heroic.

01:25.108 --> 01:26.593
The paramedics got there quick.

01:26.606 --> 01:30.690
I hardly think that delivering premature
twins in a vineyard in southern california

01:30.707 --> 01:34.290
is what the army had in mind
for justin when he enlisted.

01:34.305 --> 01:37.190
Anyway, they could just as easily be his.

01:37.205 --> 01:40.091
Oh, look, look.She looks like an ob-gyn.

01:40.108 --> 01:40.791
Sexist, mom.

01:40.808 --> 01:42.392
- Thomas walker?
- Yes.

01:42.608 --> 01:43.491
Yes.

01:43.506 --> 01:44.890
Your wife's doing fine.

01:44.908 --> 01:46.291
She just needs rest.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.091
Your brother did some excellent work.

01:48.105 --> 01:49.790
Great. And, uh,what about the babies?

01:49.808 --> 01:52.493
At 29 weeks and extremely low birth weight,

01:52.507 --> 01:54.593
we're fortunate
we got them here when we did.

01:54.607 --> 01:56.792
How--how did they do on
their tests? Their apgars?

01:56.806 --> 01:58.092
Mom, I don't think
they give preemies--

01:58.105 --> 01:58.993
I'm sorry, what tests?

01:59.006 --> 02:00.290
They haven't peed yet,have they?

02:00.306 --> 02:01.693
- I***
- Pee? Pee? What does that have to do with anything?

02:01.708 --> 02:02.691
- mom
- I'm their grandmother.

02:02.707 --> 02:05.190
- You know, they're--
- let's--let's not suffocate 'em.Okay, guys?

02:05.508 --> 02:07.493
Oh, okay.Okay, that's fine.

02:07.506 --> 02:08.789
We're a tight family--

02:09.008 --> 02:10.190
kind of like a vise.

02:10.805 --> 02:13.690
With children this premature,
there's always issues.

02:13.908 --> 02:16.492
But your girl's healthy.
She's doing really well.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.191
Just the girl?

02:19.206 --> 02:23.792
Mr. Walker,this might be a conversation
your wife should also be present for.

02:24.707 --> 02:26.390
Yeah. Yeah, um...

02:26.707 --> 02:29.091
- okay. I'm gonna...Talk to them. Thanks.
- okay.

02:30.708 --> 02:32.190
Uh, so, they're fine.

02:32.206 --> 02:33.891
Everything--everything seems normal.

02:33.907 --> 02:34.993
When do we get to see them?

02:35.008 --> 02:39.291
I mean, they're preemies,so it'll take a while,
but... it's fine.

02:39.305 --> 02:42.190
I know you wanna stay,but I think
we've got it covered.

02:42.205 --> 02:43.891
- no.
- No, I think we should stay.

02:44.107 --> 02:48.393
Come on. You all have lives.
Just go. I'll stay in touch.

02:48.407 --> 02:50.990
okay, anybody who wants
to get whiplash, go with kevin.

02:51.006 --> 02:53.190
He almost ran me off the road
speeding to get here.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.793
i am not***

02:55.508 --> 02:57.590
If we need anything,we'll--

02:57.605 --> 03:02.092
***

03:04.606 --> 03:05.200
we'll call.

03:05.217 --> 03:06.892
- All right, sweetheart.
- Okay.

03:07.805 --> 03:09.490
- Love you.
- You, too, man.

03:10.008 --> 03:11.490
Thanks. Bye.

03:11.808 --> 03:13.993
Okay, honey. Now listen,
I've got my cell phone with me,

03:14.007 --> 03:16.291
and I-I don't go to sleep,
so call me anytime...

03:16.305 --> 03:17.890
- mom.Mom. Mom. Mom.
- If you need me for anything.

03:20.706 --> 03:22.491
Um, can you stay?

03:23.808 --> 03:26.693
- Yes. Yes.
- Great.

03:28.606 --> 03:31.390
under heavy fire,under
the most harrowing conditions,

03:31.705 --> 03:33.693
you kept your chopper on that landing zone.

03:34.106 --> 03:37.593
And in spite of being shot down
and taking casualties,

03:37.608 --> 03:39.291
you got your P.O.W.S to safety.

03:39.306 --> 03:41.291
That's a remarkable display of bravery.

03:42.008 --> 03:43.490
You know,general omar bradley,

03:43.508 --> 03:45.890
who commanded our guys at normandy,

03:46.207 --> 03:49.793
says that bravery is really just
the capacity to perform

03:49.807 --> 03:51.992
when you're scared half to death.

03:52.008 --> 03:54.790
so was there ever a moment when you thought,

03:54.806 --> 03:57.491
"I just wanna leave.I could leave"?

04:00.208 --> 04:03.692
You know,I think that most people
in that situation

04:03.705 --> 04:06.891
would try to find the courage
to make the right choice.

04:06.907 --> 04:09.390
Well, you certainly did.

04:10.106 --> 04:12.493
I think that about covers my questions.

04:12.807 --> 04:14.690
- I really appreciate your time, senator.
- Thank you.

04:14.705 --> 04:15.793
I think you'll like the piece.

04:15.805 --> 04:17.591
I look forward to reading it.

04:18.305 --> 04:19.190
hi.

04:19.204 --> 04:20.591
I'm so sorry I'm late.

04:20.608 --> 04:21.392
It's just the traffic--

04:21.406 --> 04:24.291
when did the traffic in santa barbara
turn into a line like in the D.M.V.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.291
You're acting like you
weren't just at a hospital.

04:26.606 --> 04:27.391
How are the twins?

04:27.408 --> 04:31.792
Well, you know, tommy says
that everything is fine, so...

04:31.806 --> 04:34.390
- oh, good.
- So? So how did it go?

04:34.805 --> 04:38.892
You know, I think I came off as the love child
of winston churchill and dan quayle.

04:38.905 --> 04:42.091
kitty,a man's been calling
the L.A. Offices to see you.

04:42.105 --> 04:45.991
He won't say what it's about,but just that
it's personal and very important.

04:46.007 --> 04:48.393
So I set an appointment for today at 2:00.

04:48.406 --> 04:50.590
2:00--2:00? No, I'm not even
gonna make it back by then.

04:50.605 --> 04:52.492
Well, he said he wanted to wait for you.

04:52.508 --> 04:55.392
And, senator, justin walker's cell
phone number's in your P.D.A.

04:55.406 --> 04:57.191
Thank you.

04:57.606 --> 04:58.892
A man waiting for you...

04:58.907 --> 05:00.492
Personal... very important.

05:00.506 --> 05:03.193
So exactly how many other guys
did you kind of sort of

05:03.205 --> 05:05.592
but not really propose to
while I was away in D.C.?

05:05.605 --> 05:07.392
And why doesn't the staff say hi to me?

05:07.408 --> 05:09.093
Because they don't like you.

05:09.406 --> 05:12.892
So why do you need justin's phone nber,
and why didn't you ask me?

05:12.906 --> 05:14.192
It's none of your business.

05:14.707 --> 05:15.791
It's a guy thing.

05:15.806 --> 05:18.793
is there anything I can get you?
Do you want a cup of coffee, sergeant cole?

05:18.805 --> 05:21.490
- Oh, no, no. That's okay.
- Okay.

05:22.205 --> 05:24.092
I'm retired from the air force.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.691
I served with senator mccallister
in gulf war one.

05:26.707 --> 05:29.592
Ah, so do you want me to set up a reunion
with you and the, uh, senator?

05:29.608 --> 05:34.393
Well, I never actually had that much
face-to-face connection with the senator.

05:34.705 --> 05:38.693
And under the circumstances,I think it's
best if we kept it that way.

05:38.707 --> 05:40.491
Rcumstances?I'm not sure I follow.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.892
WellI'm sure that you and everybody here
think that you work for a hero,

05:44.906 --> 05:47.192
I mean, given how much talk there's been lately

05:47.205 --> 05:50.893
about mccallister's
war record and his heroism--

05:51.206 --> 05:53.393
alleged heroism, actually--

05:53.406 --> 05:55.992
so pardon me if I shatter the dream,

05:56.505 --> 06:00.593
but I know all about that helicopter crash
and those P.O.W.S,

06:00.905 --> 06:03.892
and I know mccallister tried
to call off that extraction.

06:05.007 --> 06:08.392
It is beneath the senator's dignity
for me to continue this conversation,

06:08.406 --> 06:11.893
so if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to leave.

06:11.905 --> 06:12.690
Yeah, well, that's good,

06:12.704 --> 06:14.592
'cause I have to be at the "L.A. Times"
in half an hour, anyway.

06:14.701 --> 06:16.898
Ah, well, with tffic,there's no way
you're gonna make it in 30 minutes,

06:16.900 --> 06:19.692
and besides, the "L.A. Times"--
they don't print fiction.

06:19.809 --> 06:21.390
If it was up to the senator,

06:21.608 --> 06:23.993
that chopper would've left
those soldiers stranded.

06:24.007 --> 06:26.590
He was begging his copilot
to leave the landing zone.

06:26.608 --> 06:28.192
And I'm sure the copilot didn't tell you this,

06:28.208 --> 06:30.690
considering that he was dead and all.

06:30.908 --> 06:35.491
Actually, he did tell me,
in a manner of speaking.

06:35.807 --> 06:38.790
I overheard his conversation with mccallister

06:38.805 --> 06:42.092
over the radio from the base.

06:44.006 --> 06:46.192
- Are you sure you want me to stay?
- yeah

06:46.206 --> 06:47.990
How are you doing,julia?

06:49.006 --> 06:49.993
Can you just tell me about william?

06:50.006 --> 06:51.690
Well, right now,he is on a ventilator,

06:51.706 --> 06:55.692
which is helping him breathe
until his lungs have a chance to develop.

06:56.405 --> 06:57.692
He's responding well.

06:57.705 --> 07:02.290
See? Everything's okay,honey.
Everything's okay.Right, doc?

07:02.306 --> 07:04.790
Unfortunately, there are other complications.

07:04.806 --> 07:08.291
Due to his premature birth,
his kidneys are not functioning properly.

07:08.308 --> 07:09.992
- What is the treatment for that?
- Dialysis?

07:10.006 --> 07:12.091
Yes, in fact, we've already
tried peritoneal dialysis,

07:12.106 --> 07:14.991
but it's not giving us the response
that we'd hoped for.

07:15.006 --> 07:16.493
- Oh, my god.
- What can we do?

07:16.506 --> 07:18.390
We can try hemodialysis.

07:18.407 --> 07:22.490
It's a more invasive procedure,
because it draws william's blood out,

07:22.508 --> 07:24.391
cleanses it and then
puts it back in the body.

07:24.406 --> 07:26.990
This is our strongest course of action.

07:27.506 --> 07:29.490
We really need to see results soon.

07:29.507 --> 07:31.091
This is the 21st century.

07:31.106 --> 07:33.792
There--there has to be something else,
some other option.

07:33.807 --> 07:37.490
If the situation becomes extreme
and dialysis fails,

07:37.506 --> 07:39.390
a transplant would be necessary.

07:39.407 --> 07:40.991
But he's so tiny.

07:41.008 --> 07:43.491
Can you even perform
transplants on babies so young?

07:43.506 --> 07:45.392
Yes,but they're extremely rare.

07:45.406 --> 07:49.290
Generally, it's impossible
to even find a donor in time.

07:49.305 --> 07:51.691
But your son is differt.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.290
His twin sister--your daughter--

07:54.307 --> 07:56.391
she is a perfect match.

07:56.805 --> 07:59.093
She could be the donor.

08:10.507 --> 08:13.692
Yeah, okay. Okay. Sorry.
That was uncle saul.

08:13.705 --> 08:16.993
I had to convince him not to buy out
an entire kosher deli.

08:17.008 --> 08:19.893
Matzo ball soup is my brother's
answer to everything.

08:19.906 --> 08:22.391
He also spoke to dr. Gilberlenz at cedars,

08:22.405 --> 08:25.091
who had nothing but wonderful
things to say about you.

08:25.707 --> 08:28.691
- Not that we were checking up on you.
- Oh, no. Of course.

08:28.707 --> 08:32.991
Hey, doctor, can you, uh,
can you tell us about the operation?

08:33.706 --> 08:36.991
A kidney transplant is
by no means a simple procedure,

08:37.008 --> 08:40.289
although it is relatively
routine for adults.

08:40.308 --> 08:43.592
But we've gotta keep in mind
william is ten weeks premature,

08:43.607 --> 08:49.193
and the risks that can accompany any
surgery are significantly higher.

08:49.206 --> 08:50.493
Right. How high?

08:50.507 --> 08:52.792
I'm not telling you that
there's no reason to hope,

08:52.806 --> 08:56.392
but I have to tell you, even if
the transplant is successful,

08:56.407 --> 08:58.491
additional complications can arise.

08:58.508 --> 09:00.792
What about our daughter?
She's premature, too.

09:00.807 --> 09:03.490
She will also be at considerable risk.

09:03.708 --> 09:07.893
Wait. So you're telling me if we do this,
that both my babies could die?

09:07.907 --> 09:10.891
Honey, she's just giving us
all the possible scenarios.

09:10.906 --> 09:12.792
I don't think that's
what she's saying, tommy.

09:12.805 --> 09:14.591
Doct, what do you suggest we do?

09:14.707 --> 09:17.992
I'm sorry.I wish that I could
give you an answer, but it's A...

09:18.805 --> 09:21.092
it's a very personal decision,

09:21.207 --> 09:23.193
one that only the family can make.

09:30.106 --> 09:33.191
I think that you need time to think.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.092
Okay, thanks.

09:38.506 --> 09:39.792
Mom, could you, uh...

09:40.905 --> 09:42.692
could you give us a minute?

09:45.206 --> 09:47.590
Oh, oh, yes.Yes, yes, yes, absolutely.

09:53.108 --> 09:55.392
Look at me.

09:57.207 --> 09:58.891
We will figure this out.

09:59.706 --> 10:01.690
What if--what if we waited--

10:02.107 --> 10:04.490
- we waited for another donor?
- Listen to me.

10:04.506 --> 10:06.092
He is gonna be fine.

10:06.208 --> 10:09.392
They are both gonna be fine, all right?

10:09.407 --> 10:11.291
Let's stay focused
on the big picture--

10:11.407 --> 10:15.691
two healthy, happy babies.

10:16.306 --> 10:18.292
She doesn't even have a name.

10:21.206 --> 10:22.791
We named him william.

10:24.307 --> 10:26.692
She doesn't even have a name.

10:29.906 --> 10:33.293
I can't lose them, tommy.
I can't lose them both.

10:33.308 --> 10:36.590
- We are not going to.
- I can't lose them both.

10:44.908 --> 10:46.992
Okay, you know me my entire life.

10:47.005 --> 10:49.691
Was there ever a day that gave you
the impression I liked scotch?

10:49.707 --> 10:51.792
What, I can't visit without some agenda?

10:51.807 --> 10:53.591
I mean, I just came by your office last week.

10:53.605 --> 10:55.493
Yeah, you needed parking validation.

10:55.508 --> 10:57.392
The fact that you're here
bearing gifts this time

10:57.407 --> 10:59.393
- means you want a bigger favor.
- Kevin, you know what?

10:59.407 --> 11:00.892
Don't be so bitter. Just...

11:02.607 --> 11:05.493
"21 years old"? "Highland"?

11:06.706 --> 11:09.092
This is a senator-size favor, isn't it?

11:09.605 --> 11:13.692
and this conversation has to fall under
the client/attorney privileges.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.092
- Privilege.
- Oh, whatever.

11:16.107 --> 11:17.893
Too bad I don't represent republicans.

11:18.907 --> 11:21.792
- What? Even lawyers have some scruples.
- You know, kevin?I know that.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.590
know that,and I wouldn't even be here

11:23.607 --> 11:25.692
f I wasn't in complete crisis mode. I--

11:25.706 --> 11:28.691
okay, first of all, calm down.
You sound almost nora-esque.

11:30.505 --> 11:32.692
You know what? I'm actually
glad you brought the scotch.

11:32.706 --> 11:35.192
At least this way,when I refuse to help,
you'll be a little more relaxed.

11:35.208 --> 11:39.392
You know, that's not funny.Just--let's--
let's--let's go into your office.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.891
- I--
- shush! Come.

11:51.308 --> 11:55.290
- I mean... what' a bigger word than "wow"?
- No, I know. I know.

11:55.308 --> 11:57.693
It's--it's very surprising
on so many different levels.

11:57.708 --> 11:58.591
Come on. It's not surprising

11:58.607 --> 12:01.393
senator mcdonald's isn't all he's been
cracking himself up to be,

12:01.405 --> 12:03.891
and it's not surprising someone's trying
to cash in on it.

12:03.906 --> 12:07.393
You coming to meto help clean things up,
that's a little surprising.

12:07.406 --> 12:08.892
Would you please just be honored?

12:08.908 --> 12:10.193
What about mccallister's legal team?

12:10.208 --> 12:12.392
Nobody else knows that robert
tried to call of the extraction.

12:12.405 --> 12:14.390
And robert doesn't know
that he's being blackmailed.

12:14.406 --> 12:16.591
- So what do you want from me?
- I want your advice.

12:16.607 --> 12:18.090
- I want you to help me.
- Oh, that's easy.

12:18.108 --> 12:20.192
You tell the truth this time--
the whole truth, nothing but.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.592
I'll just tell everybody that
he's been lying by omission

12:22.607 --> 12:26.292
and getting gobs of campaign mileage
from a story that isn't 100true.

12:26.306 --> 12:27.793
I didn't say it'd be fun, kit.

12:27.805 --> 12:29.790
Well, it's--it's campaign suicide.

12:30.107 --> 12:30.793
Well, you know what happens

12:30.806 --> 12:34.093
when somebody's military career
starts to get all muddy--

12:34.207 --> 12:35.693
there's no controlling the story.

12:35.706 --> 12:37.593
Remember what happened to kerry in '04?

12:37.805 --> 12:40.490
I mean, robert might not even
be reelected into the senate.

12:40.506 --> 12:42.190
Oh, yeah, that would be a shame.

12:42.405 --> 12:43.393
Oh, god, kevin, come on.

12:43.407 --> 12:46.190
Please, please, just forget
that I'm your sister.

12:46.407 --> 12:48.192
Oh, yes, and by your
reluctance to help me,

12:48.208 --> 12:49.590
I can see that you already have.

12:49.608 --> 12:52.493
But let's--let's forget
that robert is a republican.

12:52.708 --> 12:53.893
Remember how we always complain

12:53.907 --> 12:56.193
that nobody of substance
ever runs for president?

12:56.208 --> 12:57.691
Well, he has substance.

12:57.705 --> 13:00.192
Now it may not be to your
personal political liking,

13:00.308 --> 13:03.191
but yes, he has substance.

13:03.206 --> 13:07.190
Kevin, he saved those soldiers' lives,
and he almost died trying to do it,

13:07.205 --> 13:08.692
and he never once asked for credit.

13:08.708 --> 13:10.993
He just--he just didn't refuse it.

13:11.006 --> 13:13.492
Okay, so he's an accidental hero,
not a deliberate one.

13:13.508 --> 13:14.693
Now someone's calling him on it.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.790
No, no, no. No, no.
They're blackmailing him, kevin.

13:16.808 --> 13:18.692
There is a big difference.

13:19.408 --> 13:23.290
Now robert never was comfortable using
his service in the gulf for his campaign.

13:23.307 --> 13:25.191
He got pressured into it.

13:26.107 --> 13:28.191
I pressured him.

13:28.805 --> 13:31.592
I'm asking you, kevin,
please, from the bottom of mheart--

13:31.606 --> 13:34.390
please, I'm begging you.
I need your help.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.792
You know, if the senator shared your politics,

13:38.808 --> 13:40.993
you'd be sharpening
your lawyer claws right now.

13:41.007 --> 13:42.590
Yeah, maybe.

13:42.606 --> 13:44.892
But, kitty, he doesn'T.

13:45.907 --> 13:47.290
Right.

13:47.606 --> 13:49.390
I'm sorry.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.390
there's, uh, some leftovers in theridge.

14:03.406 --> 14:09.193
No, thanks. I'm still digesting oxnard's
best roadside shrink-wrapped burrito.

14:12.406 --> 14:15.191
- Sorry I abandoned you up there.
- Oh, don't be.

14:15.405 --> 14:18.291
You were right to come,
and you were right to go.

14:19.807 --> 14:21.490
As trying as "us" has become,

14:21.508 --> 14:25.890
you certainly don't need my family's
mob mentality making it worse.

14:27.706 --> 14:29.092
Any word from the hospital?

14:29.207 --> 14:32.091
Mom's up there,
so we should get a report...

14:33.305 --> 14:34.891
soon, I hope.

14:45.105 --> 14:48.492
I didn't know when you were coming home.
You didn't return any of my calls.

14:48.906 --> 14:52.492
Oh. You know, I was
in the waiting room all night.

14:54.708 --> 14:56.092
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

14:56.807 --> 15:00.193
And I stopped in at ojai
to check in on things,

15:00.407 --> 15:04.990
but, um, I just wanted to come home.
I just wanted to be home.

15:06.407 --> 15:07.890
So why didn't you...

15:09.108 --> 15:10.591
come home?

15:10.608 --> 15:12.493
I don't know.

15:14.407 --> 15:16.591
I was afraid,
I think, of this...

15:16.708 --> 15:18.790
where we are, this...

15:20.707 --> 15:22.692
purgatory.

15:31.407 --> 15:32.891
bruce has a foldout couch.

15:32.906 --> 15:35.293
He said I could crash there
for a few days.

15:37.507 --> 15:39.292
Is that what you want?

15:50.508 --> 15:52.093
what would I tell the kids?

15:52.107 --> 15:54.790
We'll tell them the truth, together.

15:56.807 --> 15:58.292
I'll go pack.

16:08.108 --> 16:11.592
I kind of feel like the guy who's about
to get whacked in a mobster movie--

16:11.805 --> 16:12.992
you know,the one where the don says,

16:13.006 --> 16:13.991
"hey, come for a ride with me,"

16:14.008 --> 16:17.293
but he ends up in the pine barons
buried in 5 pounds of lye.

16:17.308 --> 16:19.390
Well, maybe later they'll
find you swinging from a hook

16:19.406 --> 16:21.593
in a refrigerated meat truck.

16:24.007 --> 16:26.892
- Fish taco?
- Uh... yeah.

16:28.507 --> 16:30.491
So is this some sort of, like,
brother-in-law hazing thing?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.691
I think we're a little beyond
that, don't you?

16:34.905 --> 16:36.790
Look, I can't get kitty
to repropose to you,

16:36.807 --> 16:38.293
if that's what you're after.

16:39.605 --> 16:41.891
No. That's not it,but, boy,

16:42.607 --> 16:46.293
your family could teach the cia something
about obtaining classified information.

16:46.307 --> 16:47.890
But not keeping it classified.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.790
You got that right.

16:52.007 --> 16:53.791
So when do you leave?

16:56.708 --> 16:58.693
Uh, for iraq?

16:59.008 --> 17:00.792
Uh, I don't know.Soon, a couple weeks.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.193
You know, I think my mind sort of filed

17:02.208 --> 17:03.990
that date away under a separate calendar.

17:04.005 --> 17:05.790
Yeah. It's so you don't
scare yourself to death.

17:05.807 --> 17:06.992
Yeah.

17:07.007 --> 17:09.092
Justin, I know your feelings
about the war have changed,

17:10.106 --> 17:12.390
and in many ways,so have mine.

17:13.008 --> 17:15.089
But that doesn't change
the fact that you're a soldier,

17:15.107 --> 17:16.492
and you have a job to do.

17:16.607 --> 17:18.190
Your unit needs a good medic.

17:18.407 --> 17:20.492
You gotta be there for 'em,
'cause when you're over there,

17:20.505 --> 17:22.690
they are your brothers and sisters.

17:22.704 --> 17:25.592
You gotta love 'em,
you gotta protect 'em,

17:26.708 --> 17:28.590
but you can't do it
unless you're prepared.

17:33.508 --> 17:35.293
Here we are.

17:41.005 --> 17:42.193
I try to get here twice a month,

17:42.208 --> 17:44.792
or any time I've spent
too much time in D.C.

17:50.407 --> 17:52.991
- Hey, captain.Good to see you again.
- You, too.

17:53.805 --> 17:55.290
Thank you. Hey, how are you?

17:55.305 --> 17:56.791
It's good to meet you.

17:56.807 --> 17:58.292
Hey, how are you?

17:59.706 --> 18:00.893
hey, senator.Good to see you again.

18:00.906 --> 18:02.390
roy!Good to see you.You're working hard.

18:02.407 --> 18:03.491
Ah, hangin' in there.

18:03.506 --> 18:05.190
Good. Hey, how many tours
did you do--two or three?

18:05.208 --> 18:06.691
Three, sir.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.193
Three tours over there.

18:08.705 --> 18:09.490
That's great.

18:09.508 --> 18:11.292
- Well, you look strong.
- Thank you, sir.

18:11.706 --> 18:13.493
- Hey, toni.
- Hey!

18:13.506 --> 18:16.091
- Did you get those magazines we sent?
- Did I get them?

18:16.105 --> 18:17.791
They arrived in a moving van.

18:17.807 --> 18:20.293
Oh, sometimes my office
goes a little overboard.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.592
- Well, thank you.
- You bet.

18:21.607 --> 18:22.891
Senator,good to see you again.

18:22.905 --> 18:24.293
Good to see you.How you feeling?

18:24.308 --> 18:25.890
- Doing good, doing good.
- Excellent.

18:25.908 --> 18:28.692
- Thanks. Hi.
- Hey. Uh, justin walker,medic.

18:28.706 --> 18:31.192
I was with the 4th
of the 424th in afghanistan.

18:31.206 --> 18:33.993
Good to meet ya. You, uh,
work for the senator?

18:35.108 --> 18:38.492
Uh, I'gonnA...uh, no, actual,
future brother-in-law.

18:40.008 --> 18:40.993
He's a good guy.

18:41.008 --> 18:43.890
Yeah. I'm starting a tour
in iraq in two weeks.

18:49.808 --> 18:50.992
What happened to the leg?

18:51.608 --> 18:55.090
R.P.G. Went through the truck,
came out the side.

18:55.107 --> 18:56.493
***

18:56.508 --> 18:57.393
Can you walk on it?

18:57.407 --> 19:00.192
Yeah, it's gettin' better.
Just trying to get back to the fight.

19:07.906 --> 19:09.591
All right, well, call me
if you hear anything.

19:10.807 --> 19:12.693
Okay. Love you, too.Bye.

19:12.708 --> 19:14.691
- Kitty?
- No, it's sarah.

19:16.207 --> 19:17.693
Oh, my god...

19:17.705 --> 19:22.890
wow. Either that was a performance art
piece entitled "the melting slug,"

19:23.107 --> 19:25.193
or you want me to ask you about your day.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.893
Either your day was just as rough,
or your manorexia is completely cured.

19:28.907 --> 19:31.793
You know,a sandwich like this
would cost 15 bucks anywhere else,

19:31.806 --> 19:33.292
and yes, it was rough, so don't ask.

19:33.308 --> 19:34.793
I'm not.

19:35.005 --> 19:37.291
It's actually a kitty thing,
but I can't tell you--

19:37.507 --> 19:38.590
attorney/client privilege.

19:38.605 --> 19:39.792
I just said I don't care.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.490
I know, and I still won't tell you.

19:43.607 --> 19:46.293
Okay, so what was so rough about your day?

19:47.007 --> 19:48.391
You know, apart from...

19:50.308 --> 19:53.690
so I get a call from the senator--

19:54.507 --> 19:56.292
the senator--out of the blue.

19:57.206 --> 19:58.992
Maybe our days are
more similar than I thought.

19:59.005 --> 20:02.590
Well, he picks me up in this,
like, totally sweet limo,

20:02.606 --> 20:04.690
and I have no idea why
or where we're going.

20:04.707 --> 20:07.992
God, what I wouldn't give
for a date like that.

20:08.806 --> 20:12.190
what?I may hate his politics,
but this is a man with perfect skin.

20:12.906 --> 20:14.292
Okay, go on.

20:14.906 --> 20:16.993
So he takes me to a V.A. Hospital.

20:18.105 --> 20:20.591
I mean, there he is, right,
this U.S. Senator,

20:20.605 --> 20:23.890
talking to these injured vets
like it was nothing.I mean, it was...

20:25.008 --> 20:26.290
it was sort of amazing.

20:26.305 --> 20:28.992
oh, yeah, amazing, really.

20:29.007 --> 20:31.691
Maybe even heartwarming.I'm sure that's how
the press will cover it.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.091
Okay, first of all,chew with your mouth shut.

20:33.105 --> 20:34.891
And secondly,there was no press there.

20:35.005 --> 20:38.592
It was just the senator,
and he was completely genuine.

20:38.608 --> 20:41.093
You know, we walked in,
and we saw those guys, and...

20:43.708 --> 20:45.893
you know, honestly--honestly,
it scared the hell out of me.

20:45.908 --> 20:47.393
It freaked me out,
but that's why he called me.

20:47.407 --> 20:48.490
That's why he took me there.

20:48.505 --> 20:49.993
What, to scare the piss out of you?

20:50.005 --> 20:53.091
No, to show me that I have
a responsibility, you know?

20:53.107 --> 20:56.592
That--that I'm needed, that I'm
going there for a reason,

20:56.608 --> 20:58.393
a good one.

20:58.405 --> 21:00.492
You know, he's a better guy
than you think, kevin.

21:05.805 --> 21:07.493
Have you seen them yet?

21:09.008 --> 21:11.291
Oh, it's okay to be scared.

21:12.506 --> 21:14.993
Meeting your two little babies
for the first time--

21:15.008 --> 21:18.690
gonna be terrifying, even under
the best of circumstanceS.

21:18.706 --> 21:20.591
I remember when sarah was born.

21:20.605 --> 21:23.493
Your dad was so scared,
he wouldn't even look at her.

21:23.606 --> 21:25.192
Every time they brought
her in for a feeding,

21:25.206 --> 21:27.092
he just managed to be someplace else.

21:27.408 --> 21:28.691
It got to be a thing.

21:28.705 --> 21:29.993
I didn't know that.

21:30.705 --> 21:32.391
Don't tell sarah.

21:38.306 --> 21:40.391
It's not that
I don't want to see them.

21:40.707 --> 21:42.193
It's just,for the past six months,

21:42.206 --> 21:44.792
everybody's been saying don't worry,

21:45.907 --> 21:47.693
that once the babies come,

21:47.908 --> 21:50.290
it's not gonna matter that they're not
biologically yours,

21:50.308 --> 21:54.192
that once you see them,
everything will change.

21:54.208 --> 21:57.393
It already has, otherwise
this wouldn't be so hard.

21:57.405 --> 21:58.993
I'm afraid that if I see her,

21:59.006 --> 22:02.793
I-I-I can never ask herto do more
than she already has.

22:05.307 --> 22:06.991
You don't have to.

22:09.108 --> 22:11.491
You have a choice.
You and julia have a choice.

22:11.508 --> 22:13.192
Come on. I mean, what kind of father would I be

22:13.208 --> 22:15.193
if I didn't do everything I could?

22:15.906 --> 22:17.593
I know.

22:18.906 --> 22:20.691
Maybe I'm not the best example of this,

22:22.607 --> 22:25.892
but sometimes being a good parent
is knowing when not to parent.

22:26.106 --> 22:29.790
You have to get out of the way
and let life happen to your kids.

22:33.607 --> 22:36.292
They could both die.

22:41.406 --> 22:43.191
Tommy, I'm so sorry.

22:43.907 --> 22:45.191
I am so sorry.

22:45.207 --> 22:47.691
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

22:47.807 --> 22:51.090
But just know that I'll understand--
we all will understand.

22:51.106 --> 22:54.592
Whatever you choose,
we'll support you.

22:56.206 --> 22:57.793
We love you.

22:59.806 --> 23:02.090
What if I can't choose?

23:02.805 --> 23:04.390
They need you.

23:04.706 --> 23:07.991
They both need you.

23:08.905 --> 23:11.892
Tommy, they both needheir father.

23:18.507 --> 23:20.690
Knock, knock. Okay, I'm here.

23:21.306 --> 23:23.790
- What's going on?
- Oh, what,no scotch this time?

23:23.806 --> 23:25.091
- mr. Walker?
- Yeah.

23:25.108 --> 23:27.790
- Daniel cole is here.
- Great, show him in.Thank you.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.591
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You invited the blackmailer?

23:30.606 --> 23:33.090
Bet you wish you brought
that scotch after all.Take a seat.

23:34.105 --> 23:35.892
- What's going on?
- Just sit down.

23:36.806 --> 23:37.891
Daniel cole?

23:38.507 --> 23:39.693
I'm kevin walker.

23:39.706 --> 23:42.891
I'm serving as ad hoc counsel
to senator mccallister on this matter.

23:43.806 --> 23:45.093
I'm listening.

23:45.408 --> 23:46.692
We've reviewed the situation,

23:46.705 --> 23:49.293
and we've decided to proceed on your terms.

23:49.308 --> 23:50.492
Okay.

23:50.507 --> 23:51.890
And how's this gonna work?

23:51.907 --> 23:53.693
We can't just write you a check
because of the paper trail,

23:53.708 --> 23:56.292
and a cash withdrawal at this time
will take a few days to clear.

23:56.307 --> 23:58.393
Well, I've been quiet
about this for 16 years.

23:58.408 --> 23:59.790
Another day won't be that big a deal.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.690
Oh, well, actually, it will be.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.591
Because by the time we get the money,

24:03.606 --> 24:05.190
you'll already be back in jaiL.

24:05.208 --> 24:06.191
What?

24:06.207 --> 24:09.390
I'm sorry, I say "jail."It'll be an
intermediate step back to prison.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.590
These are all the ones
that would fit on the cart.

24:13.807 --> 24:14.592
Is this you?

24:14.606 --> 24:15.992
- no.
- yeah. Wow.

24:16.406 --> 24:18.291
Court records and google--

24:18.308 --> 24:20.293
the gifts that just keep on giving.

24:20.608 --> 24:21.593
I think I'll be going.

24:21.608 --> 24:23.391
I bet your children will be thrilled to know

24:23.405 --> 24:25.393
they have a half sister in pismo beach.

24:25.407 --> 24:27.491
Ironically, I've just had the experience

24:27.506 --> 24:29.192
of a half sister popping
out of the woodwork,

24:29.208 --> 24:31.192
and let me tell you,it's a real joy.

24:31.206 --> 24:33.091
I am capable of dealing with my own family.

24:33.107 --> 24:35.193
Really? Does that include
your parole officer?

24:35.206 --> 24:36.390
I mean, excuse me.

24:36.405 --> 24:38.493
criminal law is a little
outside my wheelhouse,

24:38.507 --> 24:41.591
but I'm pretty sure
"failure to pay child support"

24:41.607 --> 24:46.990
and the attempted extortion of a U.S.
Senator would viate the terms of your parole.

24:47.305 --> 24:50.193
Sit down.

24:51.607 --> 24:54.090
So here's our proposal.

24:54.706 --> 24:57.790
You walk out the door
and start to rebuild your life,

24:57.806 --> 25:00.090
and so long as you behave yourself,

25:00.107 --> 25:01.991
all those files stay in my cabinet.

25:02.005 --> 25:07.892
But if wolf blitzer so much as blinks
at senator mccallister,

25:08.406 --> 25:10.593
all bets are off.

25:11.905 --> 25:14.193
I think this is the part
where you walk out the door.

25:20.907 --> 25:22.593
Just because you stopped me
from telling people

25:23.208 --> 25:25.093
doesn't mean it's not the truth.

25:26.006 --> 25:27.592
The senator is a fraud.

25:27.906 --> 25:30.891
I hear talking.I don't see walking.

25:52.105 --> 25:53.291
rebecca.

25:53.305 --> 25:57.490
I'm sorry. Um, I didn't--
I didn't know that you were here,

25:57.507 --> 26:01.092
and, uh, I had put the kettle on, and then
then when I saw you,I just, I--

26:01.106 --> 26:02.490
no, no, no.No, it's fine, it's fine.

26:02.508 --> 26:05.691
It's not like you're standing
there with a meat cleaver.

26:06.707 --> 26:07.890
You're not, are you?

26:08.606 --> 26:10.093
Well, that's a relief.

26:11.206 --> 26:12.791
Are you going somewhere?

26:13.108 --> 26:14.792
Yeah. Yeah. Actually, um...

26:16.207 --> 26:17.290
um, yeah, my...

26:18.305 --> 26:20.792
I heard about julia and the babies.

26:20.805 --> 26:23.191
My mom told me,and I'm so sorry.

26:24.006 --> 26:25.292
And I just figured, you know,

26:25.306 --> 26:28.893
you don't need some random girl
living at your house.

26:34.508 --> 26:37.990
- are you okay?
- Fine.

26:40.208 --> 26:41.791
How are the babies?

26:43.406 --> 26:45.290
They're hanging in there.

26:45.305 --> 26:48.290
would you like some tea?

26:48.606 --> 26:50.392
yeah.

26:53.308 --> 26:56.591
it's not just the tea,it's the ceremony
that goes with it.

26:56.605 --> 27:01.291
Something about the ritual sort of helps
relax you when you feel like this,you know?

27:01.705 --> 27:03.693
'Cause for a moment,

27:04.607 --> 27:07.290
we don't really need to be
thinking about ourselves.

27:07.308 --> 27:10.792
The japanese form that I learned
in chicago was called sado,

27:11.607 --> 27:13.492
but it takes a lifetime to master.

27:14.305 --> 27:15.492
There we go.

27:15.906 --> 27:17.893
I'm not really doing this right.

27:19.306 --> 27:22.192
so first I take a sip.

27:24.007 --> 27:27.290
The sky now it's your turn.

27:32.908 --> 27:34.492
Your turn.

27:37.805 --> 27:39.191
rebecca...

27:39.406 --> 27:41.693
now you don't have to answer
this is you don't want to,

27:41.707 --> 27:45.791
but... every time
you talk about chicago,

27:45.806 --> 27:49.490
I get the feeling you're not just
talking about the windy city.

27:51.008 --> 27:52.691
My mom said something to you,didn't she?

27:52.705 --> 27:56.792
No. No, no.She was just... concerned.

27:58.806 --> 28:01.092
Did something bad happen
to you in chicago?

28:05.207 --> 28:09.792
my mother and i have a very difficult,
complex relationship.

28:10.007 --> 28:15.293
It's--it's that single mother-
single daughter world,you know?

28:15.707 --> 28:18.590
Sort of makes the walkers
seem like the brady bunch.

28:19.307 --> 28:20.690
it's true.

28:24.508 --> 28:26.192
you don't have to leave.

28:26.307 --> 28:29.393
When I said you were welcome
here like family, I meant that,

28:29.506 --> 28:31.591
without condition.

28:33.208 --> 28:34.691
Your turn.

28:36.008 --> 28:37.890
Thanks.

28:41.608 --> 28:45.592
okay. We have something that we
need to tell the both of you.

28:50.007 --> 28:52.593
mommy and daddy have decided that,

28:54.008 --> 28:57.590
that daddy won't be sleeping
here for a little while.

28:57.608 --> 28:58.790
Where is he gonna sleep?

28:58.808 --> 29:02.791
Daddy's gonna have his own apartment
and, um, he's--

29:02.808 --> 29:04.091
he's gonna sleep there.

29:04.108 --> 29:05.392
But I'll see you all the time,

29:05.408 --> 29:07.193
and I'll still pick you up from school,

29:07.205 --> 29:11.093
and on weekends we'll have
sleepovers at my apartment.

29:12.506 --> 29:14.490
It's really important that you understand

29:14.507 --> 29:19.292
that this is not because of you
or anything that you did, okay?

29:20.106 --> 29:23.491
Mommy and daddy love you both
more than anything else in the world.

29:23.506 --> 29:25.691
But you don't love each other anymore?

29:27.208 --> 29:29.092
Oh, honey...

29:31.307 --> 29:32.991
of course we do.

29:33.006 --> 29:35.793
P., How could i not love your mommy?

29:35.805 --> 29:39.190
She made you and coop,
and because of that,

29:39.207 --> 29:40.990
I will always love her,

29:41.306 --> 29:43.691
and we will always be a family
no matter where I live.

29:43.706 --> 29:47.192
But how come we can't live together?
I don't understand!

29:47.205 --> 29:50.290
Look, paige, um,

29:50.305 --> 29:53.990
we've been having
some grown-up problems,and, um,

29:55.808 --> 29:56.792
it's--it's, uh,

29:56.805 --> 30:00.991
just best if we have a little bit of
time apart so that we can...

30:02.405 --> 30:04.392
we can figure out how to fix them.

30:04.407 --> 30:05.892
Yeah, it's kind of like a time-out.

30:05.907 --> 30:07.693
Like when you do something bad?

30:07.708 --> 30:09.392
Did daddy do something bad?

30:09.405 --> 30:14.291
No. No, cooper,daddy didn't do anything bad.

30:14.308 --> 30:17.292
Are you getting a divorce?

30:21.106 --> 30:23.791
No, honey, we're--

30:24.406 --> 30:26.992
we, um, we--we need
just to take some time.

30:28.407 --> 30:30.891
Nothing...nothing's be decided.

30:30.905 --> 30:32.590
I don't believe you.

30:32.608 --> 30:34.291
It's just how gabe said.

30:34.307 --> 30:37.493
He said that first daddy moved away,
and then he got a divorce.

30:37.506 --> 30:39.493
- Sweetie--
- paige, I know this is hard,

30:40.505 --> 30:42.292
and I am so sorry.

30:43.707 --> 30:46.193
But nothing's gonna change.

30:46.205 --> 30:49.392
We're still going to be a family, okay?

30:49.406 --> 30:51.190
That's not gonna change,and you're--

30:51.706 --> 30:52.993
you're gonna have the same room,

30:53.006 --> 30:56.293
and you're gonna go to the same schools
and keep all your old friends,

30:56.305 --> 31:00.093
okay? It's--it'S...

31:01.005 --> 31:03.192
and on weekends,
we'll do something special.

31:04.108 --> 31:07.792
- Can we go to california adventure?
- Oh, yeah.Give me a bump, yo.

31:12.806 --> 31:14.890
do you have anything
you want to ask me, baby?

31:16.807 --> 31:18.493
Can I go to my room?

31:19.607 --> 31:20.990
Sure.

31:22.106 --> 31:23.693
I love you, paige.

31:24.608 --> 31:26.693
Can I go to paige's room,too?

31:28.206 --> 31:29.693
Yeah, bub.

31:38.108 --> 31:39.891
Did your mom go home?

31:39.908 --> 31:42.493
Yeah, at least for a couple of hours.

31:42.508 --> 31:45.593
We, uh, we had
a good talk last night.

31:47.005 --> 31:48.493
What about your parents?

31:49.208 --> 31:51.392
They're trying to get
a flight out of costa rica.

31:52.308 --> 31:54.892
I tried talking to them
about what's happening,but...

31:59.308 --> 32:01.390
it's hard, right?Even in person.

32:03.306 --> 32:05.593
I just thought I would be ready.

32:07.205 --> 32:11.793
But how could anybody really be ready
for something like this?

32:15.208 --> 32:16.490
Honey, uh...

32:18.805 --> 32:20.991
I don't think we should do the transplant.

32:22.605 --> 32:24.093
You don't?

32:24.807 --> 32:26.692
We'll find another donor.

32:27.008 --> 32:29.193
Getting pregnant was a miracle.

32:30.505 --> 32:32.392
So we'll--we'll wait for another one.

32:35.007 --> 32:36.492
I agree.

32:38.706 --> 32:41.693
It's too much of a risk for elizabeth.

32:42.207 --> 32:44.490
Elizabeth?

32:44.705 --> 32:46.192
Yeah.

32:47.205 --> 32:51.193
I, uh, I saw it on your list,
thought I'd try it out.

32:52.608 --> 32:54.191
I like it.

32:54.508 --> 32:55.991
Elizabeth.

32:57.307 --> 33:00.191
William and elizabeth.

33:10.106 --> 33:12.690
William spiked a fever
from the hemodialysis,

33:12.708 --> 33:14.492
and he's gone into septic shock.

33:14.508 --> 33:17.093
His organs are failing.
He doesn't have much time.

33:18.906 --> 33:20.990
- Oh, god.
- I am so sorry.

33:21.005 --> 33:24.690
If there's anything
that you want to say or do...

33:49.308 --> 33:51.893
I want to... hold him.
Can I hold him?

33:51.908 --> 33:53.190
Of course.

34:01.406 --> 34:02.992
sit down.

34:08.907 --> 34:10.690
It's okay.

34:24.205 --> 34:26.193
hi, william.

34:28.806 --> 34:29.989
Hey, little man.

34:32.206 --> 34:33.992
It's your dad.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.690
Daddy's here.

34:39.407 --> 34:41.393
And everything's gonna be okay.

34:44.005 --> 34:45.193
You know, uh...

34:47.206 --> 34:49.692
you're named after my dad...

34:51.505 --> 34:53.592
your grandpa.

34:55.907 --> 34:58.193
He's gonna take good care of you.

35:12.206 --> 35:13.092
Oh, thank you.

35:13.106 --> 35:14.691
To new beginnings.

35:16.005 --> 35:17.191
New?

35:17.805 --> 35:19.291
Well, what--what new?

35:23.505 --> 35:25.492
I've... I've been doing some thinking,

35:25.507 --> 35:30.490
and I realize that I've been focusing
on the wrong things.

35:31.405 --> 35:37.291
Really, like what?Like payola, kickbacks,
sweetheart deals with the unions?

35:37.707 --> 35:38.993
kitty,I'm a united states senator,

35:39.006 --> 35:41.991
not an alderman from chicago in the '40s.

35:42.108 --> 35:43.592
Oh, right, that's true.

35:43.806 --> 35:45.191
What happened at the hospital today?

35:45.206 --> 35:47.591
I tried to call you.
I couldn't get through on your cell.

35:47.605 --> 35:49.890
Oh! Oh, yeah.

35:49.906 --> 35:51.493
No, yeah, right, right, right.

35:51.505 --> 35:53.991
No, um, well, you know,actually, they--

35:54.008 --> 35:55.990
they make you turn your cell phone off.

35:56.607 --> 36:00.690
So--so, um,what--what is all this
about new beginnings?

36:03.608 --> 36:05.992
I'm just not gonna run
from my past anymore.

36:07.008 --> 36:08.492
It's like you said, I...

36:09.007 --> 36:12.492
my first inclination
may not have been bravery,

36:13.208 --> 36:15.792
but what I did afterwards was.

36:15.805 --> 36:17.293
- I said that?
- Yeah.

36:18.407 --> 36:19.091
That was good.

36:19.108 --> 36:21.892
You took a guy who was doubting
the strength of his leadership

36:21.907 --> 36:24.493
and reminded him why he's running
for president...

36:25.208 --> 36:28.492
and got him to embrace his past.

36:31.506 --> 36:36.191
This is very disconcertin,
talking like this in the third person.

36:37.907 --> 36:39.491
My point is...

36:41.108 --> 36:42.592
these last few months...

36:46.007 --> 36:50.893
I have been the best man I've ever been,

36:50.906 --> 36:52.793
and it's because of you.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.492
Kitty,when you proposed to me,

36:56.305 --> 37:01.993
I should have jumped to say yes before
youad the chance to change your mind.

37:03.105 --> 37:06.191
That wasn't exactly my best moment.

37:08.208 --> 37:10.393
But you can still say yes.

37:10.805 --> 37:11.992
No.

37:13.606 --> 37:15.291
No, I can'T.

37:16.805 --> 37:18.791
I can't accept your proposal...

37:20.305 --> 37:22.693
until you accept mine.

37:42.906 --> 37:47.593
Yes, yes, yes...and yes.

37:50.808 --> 37:53.493
oh, gee.

37:54.308 --> 37:55.192
Here.

37:58.405 --> 38:00.492
hellO. Oh, hey.

38:01.108 --> 38:01.890
- Hey, uncle saul.
- don't tell him.

38:01.906 --> 38:03.592
You know,you have very go timing,

38:03.606 --> 38:07.193
because you're never gonna believe
what just happened to me.

38:26.308 --> 38:29.893
*good gifts of love*

38:32.105 --> 38:36.092
*good gifts you hand me down*

38:37.608 --> 38:42.193
*I'll not forget *

38:43.306 --> 38:47.593
*these gifts to me*

38:49.208 --> 38:53.290
*I'll not forget*

38:54.907 --> 38:59.793
*these gifts to me*

39:12.808 --> 39:13.891
Hey, tommy.

39:15.705 --> 39:17.690
Well, I'm not gonna ask you
if you're all right,

39:17.706 --> 39:19.791
because there's
no possible way you could be.

39:22.406 --> 39:23.891
Julia, they, uh...

39:24.905 --> 39:26.391
they gave her something--

39:26.505 --> 39:27.891
a sedative.

39:34.305 --> 39:38.293
I went out into the hallway to,
uh, walk around...

39:40.105 --> 39:43.692
clear my hea and a father walked by...

39:46.705 --> 39:47.890
with A...

39:49.307 --> 39:51.290
with a healthy newborn,and I...

39:53.807 --> 39:55.391
I couldn't breathe.

39:55.408 --> 39:58.092
I know. I know.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.290
And I'm just--

40:00.806 --> 40:02.591
I'm wondering,did I do the right thing?

40:02.608 --> 40:05.690
Yes, you did. You did
the right thing, tommy.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.691
Because you did what
your heart told you to do,

40:08.707 --> 40:10.093
and that could never be wrong.

40:10.105 --> 40:11.890
Death is part of life.

40:14.607 --> 40:16.293
And it would be hubris for us to think

40:16.308 --> 40:19.692
that we could make any decisions
that are only god's to make.

40:23.007 --> 40:25.290
It's just so hard.

40:26.807 --> 40:28.390
You're right.

40:28.808 --> 40:30.592
It is hard.

40:31.206 --> 40:33.493
And I won't sit here and tell
you that it gets easier,

40:33.507 --> 40:34.993
because it doesn'T.

40:36.906 --> 40:38.492
Time...

40:39.408 --> 40:41.090
it heals us.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.490
It does get better.

40:46.805 --> 40:48.990
ready to meet your daughter?

40:52.908 --> 40:54.390
oh, my god.

40:56.805 --> 40:58.490
She's beautiful.

40:58.606 --> 41:00.691
Look at that perfect little nose.

41:01.605 --> 41:03.393
- Hello, little bear.
- Bear?

41:04.306 --> 41:08.291
More like a cute little lobster.

41:08.307 --> 41:10.192
we're not calling
our daughter a lobster.

41:10.208 --> 41:13.090
What are you planning on naming her,
if you don't mind my asking?

41:13.308 --> 41:15.793
- elizabeth.
- Elizabeth! Oh, I...

41:16.005 --> 41:17.892
that's such a gorgeous name.

41:17.906 --> 41:19.690
Elizabeth, hey.

41:21.008 --> 41:22.790
One day we'll tell you about your brother...

41:26.008 --> 41:27.493
and how much we loved him.

41:29.606 --> 41:30.990
Look at that face.

41:31.408 --> 41:33.593
She's as pretty as her mother.

41:35.008 --> 41:37.090
Oh, I meant that as a compliment,
sweetheart!

41:37.905 --> 41:39.391
She's so strong.

41:41.406 --> 41:43.290
She reminds me of you.

41:46.205 --> 41:50.490
Will not be alone look out, world.
Here comes lizzie walker.
