00:09.609 --> 00:12.845
<i>[Amy] Something horrible
is going on.</i>

00:12.847 --> 00:16.382
- [door creaking] <i>- This
person is seeing dead people</i>

00:16.384 --> 00:18.717
being around the bed.

00:18.719 --> 00:22.688
The thing got in bed with me,
and put their arm around me.

00:22.690 --> 00:23.922
What do you think is here?

00:23.924 --> 00:25.324
I think there's a demon here.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.394
It is taking pieces of them.

00:29.896 --> 00:34.800
There was even some reports of people
doing some weird... rituals out here.

00:34.802 --> 00:38.203
- This thing is very bad.
- Go pack your stuff now.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.006
[Amy whispering]
<i>I don't like it in here.</i>

00:41.008 --> 00:43.008
<i>Bad, bad, bad, bad.</i>

00:43.843 --> 00:45.911
It wants the person dead.

00:45.913 --> 00:49.148
My name is Amy Allan.
[moans] I see dead people.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.850
I saw a winged creature.

00:51.852 --> 00:56.388
I speak to dead people.
And they speak to me.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.557
This person
feels like a monster.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.527
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:01.529 --> 01:05.531
They are sucking the life
out of these people.

01:05.533 --> 01:08.400
- I rely on my partner.
- I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.402
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.837
So, how many bodies we talkin'?

01:11.839 --> 01:14.573
And I know every person,
every house...

01:14.575 --> 01:17.843
has secrets. It's my job
to reveal them.

01:17.845 --> 01:21.914
- But Steve and I never speak.
- We never communicate during an investigation.

01:21.916 --> 01:22.614
Until the very end.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.616
Ooh. You're not
gonna like this.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.552
- [crying] - When we uncover
if it's safe for you to stay...

01:26.554 --> 01:30.155
[sobbing] I'm sorry.
I need to take a break.

01:30.157 --> 01:34.193
- Or time to get out.
- It wants inside the house because it wants to kill you.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.027
[gasps]

01:40.500 --> 01:44.002
[ominous music playing]

01:46.906 --> 01:49.741
<i>[Steve] I'm in Oxnard,
California. It's a beachside city</i>

01:49.743 --> 01:51.343
<i>about an hour and a half
from Los Angeles.</i>

01:51.345 --> 01:55.614
<i>A woman named, Kelley,
called me in. She sounded bad.</i>

01:55.616 --> 01:58.750
<i>She thinks whatever's in the house,
killed her husband and her father.</i>

01:58.752 --> 02:01.687
<i>And she's convinced
it's still out for blood.</i>

02:01.689 --> 02:05.491
I need help. I want to cleanse this
house because honestly I can't...

02:05.493 --> 02:07.826
[inhales deeply]
I can't take any more of it.

02:07.828 --> 02:11.263
[Steve] Hopefully, Amy and I can
help before anyone else gets hurt.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.340
[Amy]
<i>This interesting place...</i>

02:22.408 --> 02:23.408
<i>I don't like it.</i>

02:23.877 --> 02:25.310
[door opens]

02:25.312 --> 02:28.280
<i>This is a not good area.</i>

02:29.916 --> 02:31.316
Ugh!

02:32.752 --> 02:34.286
[whispering] I do...
I don't like it in here.

02:35.054 --> 02:36.755
I don't know why.

02:36.757 --> 02:37.656
Oof. Bad, bad, bad, bad.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.159
Bad, bad, bad, bad!

02:46.599 --> 02:49.067
<i>[Steve] Kelley, glad I'm here,
'cause when we spoke on the phone,</i>

02:49.069 --> 02:52.004
- you sounded pretty angry.
- Correct.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.405
So, what's going on?

02:53.407 --> 02:56.742
Whatever's in this house, I feel
like it's gonna eventually kill me.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.544
I feel like it's killed my...

02:58.546 --> 03:01.880
father and my late husband.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.784
That's pretty strong of a
statement that you're telling me.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.786
- Mmm-hmm.
- Let's start with your father.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.254
Uh... Why do you say that?

03:09.256 --> 03:12.724
Because... The way he died.

03:12.726 --> 03:16.962
[Kelley] How it happened. He was
like me and you talking. Happy, laughing.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.297
Carrying on with his life.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.600
And then, he got the diagnosis,

03:21.602 --> 03:26.171
and basically, he went upstairs one
evening, and I couldn't wake him up.

03:26.806 --> 03:28.874
So, he passed away in the house?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.576
- Correct.
- So what was the diagnosis?

03:30.578 --> 03:32.010
Lymphoma cancer.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.247
- Okay, how old was he?
- He was 89 years old.

03:35.615 --> 03:36.648
Okay.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.052
Your late husband...
Tell me what happened there.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.788
Found him dead in the bedroom.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.824
- [Steve] Okay, how old was he?
- [Kelley] Forty-five.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.926
Forty-five-year-old men
don't just drop dead.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.528
He died of an overdose.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.530
Okay, I lost a brother
to an overdose.

03:51.532 --> 03:55.300
And I found him. I know what
that's like. It's not easy to deal with.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.936
- And I'm sorry that did happen to you.
- Thank you.

03:57.938 --> 04:01.640
You feel that paranormal here
influenced him to start using again?

04:01.642 --> 04:02.807
Yes, I do.

04:02.809 --> 04:06.845
[Kelley] He had been clean
and sober for about a year.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.380
[Steve] You look real happy
in this photo.

04:10.049 --> 04:11.283
Yeah...

04:11.718 --> 04:13.919
How long have you lived here?

04:13.921 --> 04:16.788
-I was born and raised here. Then, I moved away.
-Okay.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.690
And then I came back
about eight years ago.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.127
Okay. Who all lives
in the house, Kelley?

04:22.129 --> 04:26.231
My daughter, Sara. She's
15. My mother, she's 71.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.433
And myself.

04:28.435 --> 04:32.671
So, let me ask you a question. I noticed
that you had a bed set up in the living room.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.406
- I'm assuming that's for your mom.
- [Kelley] Correct.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.942
She had a stroke
about eight years ago.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.710
How bad is her health right now?

04:38.712 --> 04:39.945
Well, she...

04:39.947 --> 04:41.680
can't walk.
She's paralyzed.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.382
Completely on her left side.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.118
- Okay.
- Her mind isn't as sharp as it used to be.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.821
Lately, the last couple weeks,
she's actually has said

04:49.823 --> 04:51.990
that my father and her father

04:51.992 --> 04:53.759
has been visiting her.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.661
I asked her, "What did they say?

04:55.663 --> 04:56.862
Why are they here?"

04:56.864 --> 04:59.031
And she said that
they just came to tell her

04:59.033 --> 05:01.400
that everything's gonna be okay.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.101
What do you take from that?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.569
She's gonna be
checking out pretty soon.

05:04.571 --> 05:06.738
How you holding up with that?

05:06.740 --> 05:09.908
I just try to be strong and not
cry. I don't wanna, you know...

05:09.910 --> 05:13.545
I guess, show that I'm weak.
Because whatever's here,

05:13.547 --> 05:16.114
my full, strong belief is that

05:16.116 --> 05:19.951
it gets a kick out of that.
Out of my emotion.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.953
And I can't show that.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.089
What do you think is here?

05:24.357 --> 05:26.658
I think there's a demon here.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.027
Why not just walk away from
this madness that's going on here?

05:29.029 --> 05:31.763
My, uh, father built this house.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.399
- Okay.
- I was born in this house.

05:34.401 --> 05:37.736
And out of respect for my
father, I wanna stay here and fight.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.304
I can understand that.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.444
[Amy] I feel very, uh,
drained in here.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.847
[ominous music playing]

05:48.849 --> 05:53.552
There's like, this little
woman. Petite. Very thin, like,

05:53.554 --> 05:55.287
gray-white hair.

05:59.559 --> 06:04.396
Just like, no energy.
Frail, confused.

06:06.966 --> 06:12.871
She goes in and outta here. I'm
wondering, like, is she... still alive?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.540
Or did she die?

06:15.542 --> 06:19.911
She's so heavy with, like,
confusion and like,

06:19.913 --> 06:22.914
lot of nausea associated
with her, too.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.950
Very sick.

06:25.017 --> 06:27.753
I keep hearing "78" with her.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.156
Um... I'm assuming
this is her age?

06:34.594 --> 06:39.431
And I do feel something,
potentially with her heart.

06:39.433 --> 06:43.402
Yeah, I think the living would
certainly get sick in here.

06:43.404 --> 06:47.372
I gotta get out. I got, I
gotta out this... room.

06:48.541 --> 06:50.075
Like it... [groans]

06:54.580 --> 06:56.715
<i>[Steve] Why'd you bring me
into this room?</i>

06:56.717 --> 06:58.984
- This is where my father passed.
- Okay.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.719
How long ago
did your father pass?

07:00.721 --> 07:01.853
A year ago.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.722
- Okay, so he was in bed here?
- Yes.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.691
Basically, he came up
from downstairs,

07:06.693 --> 07:10.061
came to bed and really,
kind of, never woke up.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.030
Okay, but you were here
in the room when he passed?

07:12.032 --> 07:14.099
- Correct.
- I'm curious, though.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.700
Do you think he's
still here at all?

07:15.702 --> 07:18.270
- I don't believe so.
- Okay.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.772
You like that he's not here?
Or you wish he was?

07:20.774 --> 07:26.044
- No. He... needs to be where he needs to be.
- Right. Okay.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.550
[Amy] There's
an older male here.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.119
Feel like a heart attack
with him.

07:34.654 --> 07:38.890
I'm assuming he lived here
at some point.

07:38.892 --> 07:42.894
I don't know if he owned
this house, or if it was family?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.863
He seems fairly recent.

07:44.865 --> 07:49.234
Maybe the 90s or, uh, 2000s.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.972
<i>He seems frustrated.
He wants out.</i>

07:53.974 --> 07:57.576
<i>- He doesn't like it.
- [low growling noise]</i>

07:57.578 --> 07:59.811
I think he's pissed.
He's just upset.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.580
I, I don't know.
He's an angry guy.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.615
[Amy] He likes it outside.

08:03.617 --> 08:07.552
Out back. Uh, he feels like
he's been pushed out.

08:07.554 --> 08:11.223
He's just like,
"Everything's gone to [bleep]"

08:12.592 --> 08:15.794
<i>[Steve] So, what if any experiences,
are you having in the house?</i>

08:15.796 --> 08:18.897
Right after my dad died,
I heard... his voice.

08:18.899 --> 08:22.501
Saying, "I'm cold. I am cold."

08:22.503 --> 08:24.769
So, "I'm cold." Does that
mean anything to you?

08:24.771 --> 08:27.873
That's what he had told me
before he was dying.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.841
And you're confident
it was your father's voice?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.277
I'm confident it was his
voice, but it was not him.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.412
It was demonic.

08:34.414 --> 08:38.416
That's actually when I knew
then and there, that this thing is...

08:39.418 --> 08:40.819
Straight up evil.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.754
All right, so, anything else?

08:42.756 --> 08:45.757
I see shadow figures
throughout the house.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.893
All right. So, give me
an example.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.861
One time, I was sleeping
in Sara's room.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.030
<i>Then I woke up.</i>

08:52.032 --> 08:55.600
<i>To some large shadow
standing over me.</i>

08:55.602 --> 08:57.135
So how big are we talkin'?

08:57.137 --> 08:58.970
- I feel about this tall.
- Okay.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.672
About ye wide.

09:00.674 --> 09:02.707
It was touching me like, here.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.743
- [Steve] Caressing you?
- Yep. Just doing this.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.578
Oh. What else is going on?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.414
Well, I have dreams about
this demon-looking thing.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.616
And I, I just call it
a "thing."

09:11.618 --> 09:13.818
- Can you describe it for me?
- Yes.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.722
He crawls on all fours,
his body's bruised all over.

09:17.724 --> 09:21.126
-All right.
-And his face is kinda... disfigured.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.162
So, in your dream
when you see this "thing",

09:24.164 --> 09:26.965
- does it appear like it wants to hurt you?
- Yes.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.900
And in, in what way?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.936
Physically, mentally,
emotionally.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.171
I honestly don't know
how you live in here.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.239
Me neither.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.311
[Amy] I'm seeing that old,
dying woman.

09:40.813 --> 09:45.016
<i>And she's looking in the
mirror and talking to herself?</i>

09:45.785 --> 09:48.386
<i>I think she opened
some sort of gateway.</i>

09:50.556 --> 09:53.892
[Amy] I got this thing.
It looks burned.

09:53.894 --> 09:57.996
Or really old or both. Kept
trying to absorb my energy.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.831
I think that thing can come
and go through the mirror.

09:59.833 --> 10:03.602
<i>There're also random dead
people coming out of the mirrors.</i>

10:03.604 --> 10:06.738
So, I'm thinking
these aren't the best people.

10:06.740 --> 10:11.409
I think the living would seal that
intention, that negative, darkness.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.379
Their energy's being sucked.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.647
- [Matthew] The living?
- Yeah.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.149
So they're being drained.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.720
<i>The dead people in the mirror
are taking their energy.</i>

10:21.722 --> 10:26.858
Now, the scary thing there is that when that's
happening, when the dead are doing this,

10:26.860 --> 10:29.861
it's not only just the
person's energy, it's like,

10:29.863 --> 10:32.163
their personality,
their memories.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.166
[Amy] This is negative and bad.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.057
<i>[Steve] So, Jennifer, I
understand you used to live here.</i>

10:59.059 --> 11:00.392
- Yes.
- Talking to your mom,

11:00.394 --> 11:03.695
she's convinced that the
paranormal killed your grandfather,

11:03.697 --> 11:07.699
killed her late husband, and is lookin'
to kill somebody else in this home.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.768
- Hmm.
- I wanna know what you think about her,

11:09.770 --> 11:12.470
or is she overreacting
with what she's thinking?

11:12.472 --> 11:14.873
No, I don't think
she's overreacting at all.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.409
I'm worried something's
gonna happen to her.

11:17.411 --> 11:20.412
Okay, so, I gotta assume
you've had experiences here.

11:20.414 --> 11:23.615
I have. There's something here
that's...

11:23.617 --> 11:25.750
makes people angry, and fight.

11:25.752 --> 11:29.554
Me and my husband, we
would start fighting, arguing.

11:29.556 --> 11:33.391
- Was that the cause of you moving away from here?
- Yeah.

11:33.393 --> 11:37.095
I had to get out of this house,
'cause I felt like this house was just...

11:38.798 --> 11:39.998
Destroying the marriage, really.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.766
Okay, so, anything else?

11:41.768 --> 11:44.102
I was actually living in here,
at the time.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.438
In this room.
My son was sick all night.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.607
He was about...
maybe five, six months old.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.310
So, now I was just, you know,
I was trying to comfort him.

11:52.312 --> 11:55.714
But right when I did that, I
literally got punched in my back.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.382
You realize how dangerous
that was,

11:57.384 --> 11:59.551
you holding a newborn
and getting punched like that?

11:59.553 --> 12:00.652
Yes, it was very dangerous.

12:00.654 --> 12:04.589
Okay, so, that was
pretty intense. Anything else?

12:04.591 --> 12:08.693
Um, one time I was washing,
um, my son's bottles in the kitchen.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.962
<i>- [Steve] Okay.
- [Jennifer] And there's a...</i>

12:10.964 --> 12:13.898
<i>A window above the sink.
I happen to glance up.</i>

12:13.900 --> 12:16.868
And I seen an older lady

12:16.870 --> 12:18.803
in like, a vintage night gown.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.405
It scared the crap out of me.

12:20.407 --> 12:23.408
If you saw a photo,
or a portrait,

12:23.410 --> 12:26.010
- you think you'd recognize her?
- [Jennifer] Yes, actually,

12:26.012 --> 12:29.080
me and my mom were going
through old family photos one time,

12:29.082 --> 12:30.481
and I was like,

12:30.483 --> 12:33.251
"Who is this? This is the lady
who I've seen standing behind me."

12:33.253 --> 12:37.021
- So, who was it?
- It was actually my, my mom's grandma.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.957
- So, your great-grandmother.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.424
Interesting.

12:42.728 --> 12:47.232
<i>[Amy] I see a woman. But she's
like a [bleep] shadow woman.</i>

12:49.068 --> 12:52.537
Shadow woman
is very present in here.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.039
She's coming from outside.

12:57.843 --> 13:00.612
[Amy] If living people see
her, they see a shadow person.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.447
She has a, has a dark side.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.383
Like, I see her getting
angry and yelling.

13:08.854 --> 13:12.624
And when she doesn't get her
way, she... she's got a violent temper.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.760
I see her banging on the walls.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.963
- Banging on the bed.
- [thudding]

13:24.403 --> 13:27.205
[Amy shudders]
Ugh. God...

13:33.012 --> 13:34.712
So, Sara,
this is a pretty cool room.

13:34.714 --> 13:35.680
Thank you.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.348
Would you rather
move from here? Or, or...

13:37.350 --> 13:39.384
Would you rather stay
if we can fix it?

13:39.386 --> 13:42.887
I like living here. But if we
have to move, I wouldn't mind it.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.923
How about experiences
that you've had?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.391
Can you tell me about 'em?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.726
I just, honestly,
have the worst nightmares.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.862
So, tell me about some of them.

13:50.864 --> 13:51.763
I've had some where, like,

13:51.765 --> 13:53.298
I'm being held down
and I can't move.

13:53.300 --> 13:56.534
- Right.
- Or like, I'm being choked.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.637
Like, a lot of them would just be
like, like, I'm being, like, suffocated.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.573
I mean, just thinking
about that scared me.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.474
- Yeah.
- [Steve] I'm trying to breathe.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.411
So, do you wake up,
and, from all this anxiety?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.848
Yeah, I wake up like,
really, really scared.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.549
- So, you laugh when you're nervous, right?
- [chuckles nervously] Yes.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.952
[Steve] I could see that.
Okay.

14:13.954 --> 14:17.589
- So you're nervous right now?
- [chuckles] Yeah, I don't like talking about that.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.757
[Steve] Ah... Okay.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.791
All right,
what else is going on?

14:20.793 --> 14:25.463
One time, I was laying in bed
right here, and...

14:25.465 --> 14:29.734
something came in and walked
around to the other side of the bed.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.403
And then got into bed with me,
and put their arm around me.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.539
And then got up, and walked out.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.074
Did you think you were dreaming?

14:36.076 --> 14:39.878
No. 'Cause this was like,
very, very for real.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.046
- I don't want that to happen to you ever again.
- [Sara] Mmm-mmm.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.950
Because, if it can do that, who, you
know, who knows what else it can do.

14:48.587 --> 14:51.055
<i>[Amy] Feel attacks happening.</i>

14:51.057 --> 14:56.127
<i>This is an actual living person
who's getting, like, attacked.</i>

14:56.129 --> 14:59.130
<i>This person is seeing...</i>

14:59.632 --> 15:01.065
Dead people.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.434
I believe coming out the closet.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.405
<i>I just see a bunch of people
coming out the closet,</i>

15:07.407 --> 15:09.207
being around the bed.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.846
So, I think this person's a
medium, and they just opened up

15:14.848 --> 15:17.415
vortex, or something
in their closet.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.250
And so, dead people
are coming in.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.127
[Amy] That thing. The one that
I saw coming through the mirror,

15:29.129 --> 15:32.630
they see it. And I think,
that scares them the most.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.199
And then it comes down
on the bed.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.536
[Matthew] So what does it
look like?

15:38.538 --> 15:39.604
[Amy] It's pretty big.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.675
The skin is weird.
The skin's like, burned.

15:43.677 --> 15:47.745
Or like, mummified. Kind
of like a gray-brown color.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.415
And it's got really long hands.

15:50.417 --> 15:54.085
Super skinny,
and not anatomically correct.

15:54.087 --> 15:55.420
[Matthew] Is this thing...

15:56.322 --> 15:58.790
Dangerous... the living?

15:58.792 --> 16:02.193
- Yeah, because it can take energy.
- [Matthew] What can it do?

16:02.195 --> 16:05.163
It is taking pieces of them.

16:07.866 --> 16:11.436
It's taking their memory and that's
kind of breaking them down mentally.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.439
So, it's like a [bleep]
monster, really.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.786
<i>[Steve] It wasn't hard to figure
out where to start this investigation.</i>

16:28.788 --> 16:30.521
<i>There's an old cemetery
right by Kelley's house.</i>

16:30.523 --> 16:33.558
<i>In fact, you could see it
from her kitchen.</i>

16:33.560 --> 16:37.228
<i>So I called a local author who says
the place has a long and sad history</i>

16:37.230 --> 16:39.998
<i>that I'm definitely
gonna wanna know about.</i>

16:44.970 --> 16:46.804
<i>[Steve] So, Connie, I gotta thank
you for helping me out with this case</i>

16:46.806 --> 16:47.905
<i>and meeting me here.</i>

16:47.907 --> 16:50.408
This cemetery looks
pretty run down. Um...

16:50.410 --> 16:52.076
What can you tell me about it?

16:52.078 --> 16:55.380
- [Connie] Well, this is the Masonic Hueneme Cemetery.
- [Steve] Okay.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.515
It was established in 1898.

16:57.517 --> 17:03.087
You can't tell by the way it looks
now, but it was once a lush cemetery.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.692
[Steve] All right. So, this place
has been here over 120 years,

17:07.694 --> 17:09.827
it sounds like.
So, who built it?

17:09.829 --> 17:13.164
The original board of
directors- Winfield Saviers...

17:13.166 --> 17:15.767
- Okay.
- a banker named Achilles Levy.

17:15.769 --> 17:16.601
[Steve] Okay.

17:16.603 --> 17:18.736
And a former senator,
Thomas Bard.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.940
<i>[Connie] You probably saw some of these
names on the street signs around town.</i>

17:22.942 --> 17:26.010
Actually, I have. So, some of
those names you mentioned to me,

17:26.012 --> 17:27.412
are those people buried here
at all?

17:27.414 --> 17:30.515
Yes, they are. The Saviers
family is actually located over there.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.682
<i>- [Steve] Okay.
- And, uh, their young son,</i>

17:31.684 --> 17:34.952
<i>Jack, is also buried
right there.</i>

17:34.954 --> 17:36.754
[Steve] Okay, so any idea how
many people are buried here?

17:36.756 --> 17:39.524
Originally, it was 360 plus.

17:39.526 --> 17:44.529
- Okay.
- Um, but the current owner says it's more like 50 to 60.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.764
All right, so, what happened
to the rest of those bodies?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.434
In 1908, they separated
the cemetery.

17:49.468 --> 17:51.536
Over there, they separated
the Japanese.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.806
<i>There's about 140 people
buried in that cemetery.</i>

17:54.808 --> 17:59.343
And, along the tree line, are
burials of Mexican-Americans.

17:59.345 --> 18:03.848
[Steve] Okay, so if I got this right,
they didn't want any white people buried

18:03.850 --> 18:07.085
in the same cemetery with
Japanese or Mexican people as well?

18:07.087 --> 18:07.952
That is correct.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.821
Not for nothing,
but this place is a mess.

18:09.823 --> 18:12.657
I mean, is, is anybody even
being buried here anymore?

18:12.659 --> 18:15.660
No, the last burial was in 1949.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.863
- Okay.
- Since then, there's been vandalism going on,

18:18.865 --> 18:20.765
people have stolen headstones.

18:20.767 --> 18:25.403
And there was even some reports of
people doing some weird rituals out here.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.971
- Really?
- Yes.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.408
But yet, names of these people that
are buried here are all over the city?

18:30.410 --> 18:34.278
- Correct.
- But they don't think twice about their resting site?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.247
Yeah, that's... It's a shame.

18:38.750 --> 18:43.254
<i>[Amy] I get to this cemetery
area and I see this huge hole.</i>

18:45.858 --> 18:50.294
And I had to fight, like,
to try to keep myself

18:50.296 --> 18:52.697
from being sucked into the hole.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.799
<i>And it's dark, and it's
negative, and it takes people,</i>

18:54.801 --> 18:57.068
<i>or rather, their energy down.</i>

18:57.302 --> 19:00.004
[Amy] This is negative and bad.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.309
<i>[Steve] Connie mentioned that
one of the graves belonged to a kid</i>

19:05.311 --> 19:06.744
<i>from a prominent family here.</i>

19:06.746 --> 19:10.448
<i>So I called the local history
teacher, who says that's true.</i>

19:10.450 --> 19:13.217
<i>And that the boy's death
was a tragic fluke accident.</i>

19:19.324 --> 19:20.825
<i>[Steve] Well, Chris,
I appreciate you coming out</i>

19:20.827 --> 19:23.394
<i>- and helping me out with this case.
- [seagull squawks]</i>

19:23.396 --> 19:25.530
Before we get
to this kid's tragic death,

19:25.532 --> 19:27.865
this prominent family... What
can you tell me about them?

19:27.867 --> 19:31.769
The Saviers. Saviers have
been here for over 100 years.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.504
- Okay.
- A powerful family.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.740
During your research
of this family,

19:35.742 --> 19:38.843
did anything stand out with
them that might help my case?

19:38.845 --> 19:41.279
Yeah, the, uh,
matriarch of the family.

19:41.281 --> 19:43.014
Um, Charlotte, stands out.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.650
- She, uh, was from Massachusetts.
- Okay.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.619
And she came
through Iowa in 1880s.

19:48.621 --> 19:53.257
And she married, uh,
Charles Saviers in 1888.

19:53.259 --> 19:54.725
- Here in California?
- Here in California.

19:54.727 --> 19:58.863
And what's more interesting about
that is that it was a shotgun wedding.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.900
Okay, so back in those days, that had
to be a big deal. Pretty scandalous, right?

20:02.902 --> 20:04.502
Yeah, it is pretty scandalous
at the time.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.404
Uh, it just doesn't happen.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.873
All right, so they obviously had
one child. Did they have any more?

20:08.875 --> 20:10.474
Well, they had a total of four.

20:10.476 --> 20:15.079
In this 1900 census,
it shows that, four children.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.883
All right. So, who's this kid,
Jack, buried by my client's house?

20:18.885 --> 20:21.652
He is the only child

20:21.654 --> 20:24.689
of her son, Walter,
and his wife, Margaret.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.357
So, what happened
to this kid, Jack?

20:26.359 --> 20:27.692
[Chris] Uh, that is pretty sad.

20:27.694 --> 20:30.461
Jack is at his grandmother's

20:30.463 --> 20:34.532
and grandfather's house
playing around a wagon.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.101
And the wagon
has bales of hay in it.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.004
Two fall off, crush his skull
and break his arm.

20:40.006 --> 20:40.972
How old was he?

20:40.974 --> 20:43.808
- [Chris] Four years old.
- Ah, jeez.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.009
All right,
so when did this happen?

20:45.011 --> 20:46.844
Happened in 1918.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.346
Did he die instantly?

20:48.348 --> 20:54.919
He died a week later on February
1st, 1918. Here's an article on it.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.321
- [Steve] So this poor kid suffered for a week.
- [Chris] Oh, yes.

20:57.323 --> 21:01.359
[Steve] So talking about Charlotte,
that's her grandchild, and...

21:01.361 --> 21:04.862
It happened on their property.
She must've been... You know,

21:04.864 --> 21:07.365
- destroyed from the guilt.
- Yeah, she has to be devastated.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.433
That family, it had
to tear them apart.

21:09.435 --> 21:12.036
It just goes to show that if you
got money and you're powerful,

21:12.038 --> 21:14.538
it doesn't stop a tragedy
like this from happening.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.439
No.

21:17.909 --> 21:20.144
[Amy] I'm seeing
the shadow woman again.

21:20.646 --> 21:24.415
She, you know, came
form back east.

21:24.417 --> 21:28.786
From the east, she went to the
Dakotas and then she walked here.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.788
She said she slept her way here

21:30.790 --> 21:32.757
- and she was laughing.
- [distant laughing]

21:32.759 --> 21:35.426
So I kind of think
she was like a hooker.

21:35.428 --> 21:39.230
The year 1918
is very important for her.

21:43.068 --> 21:47.405
<i>Like, I feel, like, horrible.
Something horrible is going on.</i>

21:47.407 --> 21:48.306
[objects jingling]

21:49.908 --> 21:52.043
[shudders] I'm scared.

21:52.944 --> 21:57.248
[humming] I am scared.

a property near a vandalized cemetery</i>

22:30.416 --> 22:32.483
<i>where strange rituals were done.</i>

22:32.485 --> 22:34.719
<i>But I want to see
if there's anything else.</i>

22:34.721 --> 22:38.155
<i>Searching through old records,
I find a brutal triple murder</i>

22:38.157 --> 22:40.358
<i>that happened just down
the road from Kelley's house.</i>

22:41.626 --> 22:42.660
<i>I've reached out
to a retired detective.</i>

22:42.662 --> 22:45.396
<i>He looked into this homicide
for me and says</i>

22:45.398 --> 22:49.433
<i>the senseless triple murder was
about two things, revenge and money.</i>

22:55.874 --> 22:59.677
<i>So, Mike, I appreciate you
helping me out with this case.</i>

22:59.679 --> 23:01.579
This homicide,
who were the players?

23:01.581 --> 23:04.081
So you have
an Oxnard ranch family.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.984
- Okay.
- Uh, Swiss immigrant, Peter Furrer,

23:06.986 --> 23:08.619
- his wife, Bertha--
- Okay.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.455
And they have an infant
daughter, Virginia, ten months old.

23:11.457 --> 23:13.557
What'd you find out
about these people in general?

23:13.559 --> 23:16.594
- I mean, what's their story?
- Well, the ranch, actually, was pretty successful.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.263
- Uh, Peter employed a number of ranch hands.
- Okay.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.599
Uh, one of those ranch hands
was named Louis Fortene.

23:21.601 --> 23:27.271
Uh, unfortunately, Louis was not a good
ranch hand and Peter ended up firing him.

23:27.273 --> 23:30.408
All right, I see where this
might be going. What happened?

23:30.410 --> 23:34.345
As a active revenge, he
went and cashed a $250 check

23:34.746 --> 23:35.746
in, uh, Peter's name.

23:35.748 --> 23:37.581
All right, so what happens next?

23:37.583 --> 23:42.820
Couple weeks go by and he gets
real nervous about getting caught.

23:42.822 --> 23:48.392
So he comes back to the ranch,
he finds Peter in the barn

23:48.394 --> 23:50.828
and proceeds
to find a metal pipe

23:50.830 --> 23:53.030
and hit him over the head
with it and kill him.

23:53.832 --> 23:56.133
[Steve] So what's he do
after that?

23:56.135 --> 23:57.768
Well, he decides that there
are some more loose ends,

23:57.770 --> 24:01.972
so he goes into the house and he
finds Bertha and he hits her over the head

24:01.974 --> 24:04.341
with the same metal pipe
and kills her as well.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.742
Okay, so now
we got the baby left.

24:05.744 --> 24:09.947
Yes, and, unfortunately, uh, he
didn't know what to do with the baby,

24:09.949 --> 24:12.516
so he decided that he was
going to end her life as well.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.318
- [Steve sighs]
- Same metal pipe.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.021
- And she's ten months old, right?
- [Mike] Yes.

24:17.023 --> 24:19.490
[Steve] This sick [bleep]. He
doesn't know what to do with the kid

24:19.492 --> 24:20.724
and he just kills her.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.393
Like, this ten-month-old's
gonna identify him.

24:22.395 --> 24:25.429
Absolutely, yeah, I have all three death
certificates here as well for the family.

24:25.431 --> 24:29.767
Uh, all indicating death
by homicide with a metal pipe.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.535
[Steve] So the cause of death
is the same for all three of them.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.003
[Mike] Correct.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.806
So he comes back later though,
he decides he's not finished.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.242
So he brings a can
of kerosene with him.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.912
He moves all three
family members into one room

24:41.914 --> 24:45.683
and then he spreads out the kerosene
and proceeds to light the house on fire.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.418
All right, so they track
this guy down?

24:47.420 --> 24:49.753
Tracked him down,
brought him in for questioning

24:49.755 --> 24:53.858
and under a question by the sheriff,
he admits to all three homicides.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.793
Did he go to trial
or did he just plea out?

24:55.795 --> 24:57.695
Went to trial
and was found guilty.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.697
Sentenced him
to death by hanging.

24:59.699 --> 25:01.732
All right, so he's found guilty
and sent away, where'd he go?

25:01.734 --> 25:05.035
He went to San Quentin.
I have his mugshot right here.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.538
[Steve] Wow, I can't believe
you got this mugshot from 1916.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.874
Look at the dates.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.877
[Mike] The crime committed in March,
1916. Hung in the gallows that July.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.745
That was the justice system
back then.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.413
What a piece of [bleep], huh?

25:18.583 --> 25:23.420
I'm hearing, like, a
man, just, like... Barking.

25:23.422 --> 25:26.757
[exhales] I'm, like, scared. I'm
scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

25:26.759 --> 25:27.758
[exclaims]

25:27.760 --> 25:30.094
<i>- Something about a fire.
- [fire sizzling]</i>

25:30.096 --> 25:33.931
<i>Like a little piece
of this person just left.</i>

25:33.933 --> 25:39.570
I think that the living would
feel this panic and fear,

25:39.572 --> 25:42.406
like they're being watched
around in here.

25:42.408 --> 25:47.411
And feeling stalked and,
uh, feeling a lot of pain.

25:47.413 --> 25:50.180
Like a pain, a horrible pain
in my side.

25:50.815 --> 25:51.415
Pain in my neck.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.919
Um... Pain in my jaw.

25:54.921 --> 25:58.923
So what exactly might the
living pick up off of this pain?

25:58.925 --> 26:01.692
Sudden, like, stabbing feeling
in the side.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.127
[knife slicing]

26:03.129 --> 26:05.396
Horrible neck pain,
horrible jaw pain.

26:05.398 --> 26:10.601
[groans] God, and back, yeah.
Wicked, wicked back pain.

26:10.603 --> 26:13.370
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
like wicked all through here.

26:13.372 --> 26:16.206
Horrible, horrible,
horrible, horrible.

26:23.615 --> 26:27.685
I saw several horrifying things
on my walk, but two stood out.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.888
First, the dead guy who got
pushed out to the backyard.

26:30.890 --> 26:34.658
He was, like, bald on top.
Late 70s, early 80s.

26:34.660 --> 26:37.728
Moustache, uh, so pretty thick.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.364
Does he have any markings
or scars on his face?

26:40.366 --> 26:44.702
It seems like he had rough
skin on his, uh, cheeks.

26:44.704 --> 26:48.839
Next, I described the thing climbing
into bed with the living woman.

26:48.841 --> 26:53.777
Its skin is strange.
It looks gray.

26:53.779 --> 26:58.015
It's got abnormally long limbs.

26:58.017 --> 27:02.152
Definitely like
an elongated skull.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.093
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:10.128 --> 27:12.029
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:14.799 --> 27:15.432
[indistinct whispering]

27:22.974 --> 27:24.441
[crickets chirping]

27:32.784 --> 27:36.820
<i>[Steve] Now that Amy and I
have completed our investigations,</i>

27:36.822 --> 27:39.456
<i>we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other</i>

27:39.458 --> 27:42.126
<i>and our clients
for the first time.</i>

27:43.361 --> 27:47.631
So, guys, this is Amy. She's gonna
be doing the reveal from another room

27:47.633 --> 27:51.869
where she can concentrate on your
case and the dead without any distraction.

27:51.871 --> 27:55.773
Amy, meet Kelley. Uh,
she's the one that called us in.

27:55.775 --> 28:00.010
She lives here
with her 71-year-old mom

28:00.679 --> 28:03.614
who, unfortunately, is not
doing too well health wise,

28:03.616 --> 28:06.016
and her 15-year-old
daughter Sara.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.886
This is Jennifer, one of
Kelley's other daughters.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.721
She grew up here
and got the hell out

28:10.723 --> 28:12.423
because of all the stuff
that was going on.

28:12.425 --> 28:15.859
And she wishes the rest of the
family would do the same actually.

28:15.861 --> 28:21.065
So unless Amy's got some questions
for you, she'll tell us about her walk.

28:24.035 --> 28:29.373
So I have to say that this
was a very active walk.

28:29.375 --> 28:34.445
The first thing that I want to
discuss is the deceased woman.

28:34.447 --> 28:38.315
She did have an accent. She
told me she was from back east.

28:38.317 --> 28:42.686
She had traveled to, first,
apparently, the Dakotas.

28:42.688 --> 28:48.859
And then she kind of said that
she, um, slept her way here.

28:48.861 --> 28:53.597
I took that as her potentially
being a prostitute.

28:53.599 --> 28:57.735
She did mention a few times
the year 1918.

28:57.737 --> 29:02.606
The living may see her,
uh, in the shadow form.

29:02.608 --> 29:05.542
The problem is that she
actually does have a dark side.

29:05.544 --> 29:08.412
Basically, if she doesn't
get her way,

29:08.414 --> 29:13.050
uh, that's when she kind of lashes
out and becomes a bit violent.

29:13.052 --> 29:18.021
I see her banging on the
walls, banging on the bed.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.860
You did tell me
about seeing shadows.

29:22.862 --> 29:26.697
Yes, standing over me
while I was sleeping

29:26.699 --> 29:30.134
and have been,
you know, physically touched.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.970
What about the banging noises?
Does that make any sense to you?

29:32.972 --> 29:34.571
Sure does.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.940
The bed, it would move, shake.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.309
So that shadow woman
you're talking about

29:39.311 --> 29:42.546
reminds me of a woman that
I came across in my research.

29:42.548 --> 29:45.949
Her name was Charlotte and she
was originally from New England.

29:45.951 --> 29:50.621
Now she came here to California
in the 1880s by way of Iowa.

29:50.623 --> 29:54.158
In 1888, she married
into the Saviers family.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.794
- Wow.
- [Steve] Now, they're one of the most

29:56.796 --> 29:58.695
prominent families in town.

29:58.697 --> 30:01.765
Uh, I don't know if you
know this, but there's signs

30:01.767 --> 30:03.734
<i>all over the place
with their name on it.</i>

30:03.736 --> 30:06.703
Now, the shadow woman told
you she might've slept her way here,

30:06.705 --> 30:07.971
I think what she might've meant

30:07.973 --> 30:13.310
was that she had to have a
shotgun wedding back in 1888.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.813
And back then,
that was scandalous.

30:15.815 --> 30:20.551
Now you also mentioned the year
1918 which was very important to her.

30:20.553 --> 30:23.287
So in late January of that year,

30:23.289 --> 30:27.658
uh, her four-year-old grandson
was playing on the farm.

30:27.660 --> 30:33.797
All of a sudden, two bales of hay came
crushing down and landed on the kid.

30:33.799 --> 30:36.700
Fractured his skull,
kid was only four years old

30:36.702 --> 30:39.002
and he died eventually
about a week later.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.939
He's actually buried
at the cemetery

30:41.941 --> 30:43.440
that you could throw
a rock at from here.

30:44.008 --> 30:47.211
- Oh, what?
- Yeah.

30:47.745 --> 30:48.745
What kind of cemetery is it?

30:48.747 --> 30:50.781
It's a mess, it's in disrepair.

30:50.783 --> 30:53.083
<i>There's headstones
everywhere missing.</i>

30:53.085 --> 30:56.019
They think satanic groups might've
been in there doing some rituals.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.120
Oh.

30:59.924 --> 31:01.058
[crickets chirping]

31:01.492 --> 31:02.960
<i>[Steve] Okay, what else?</i>

31:04.562 --> 31:07.898
The next dead person
that I came into contact with

31:07.900 --> 31:09.666
was, initially,
in the living room.

31:09.668 --> 31:12.436
It's, like, the back
of the house.

31:12.438 --> 31:17.941
He is actually pretty recent. I
would've said 1990s or 2000s.

31:17.943 --> 31:22.646
I got that he died suddenly.
I think from a heart attack.

31:22.648 --> 31:26.183
And he's very upset
and very frustrated.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.685
So now he hangs out mostly
in the backyard.

31:28.687 --> 31:33.457
Right, so Amy, now's probably a good
time to tell you why Kelley called us in.

31:33.459 --> 31:37.728
She believes that the house has
already killed two people she loves.

31:37.730 --> 31:40.797
Now, the first, that was her
husband, Ruben, who passed away

31:40.799 --> 31:42.833
here in the house in 2007.

31:42.835 --> 31:47.804
I have a photo of Ruben
and... Kelley.

31:47.806 --> 31:51.108
[Kelley] He, uh, was
a recovering addict.

31:51.110 --> 31:54.745
He ended up using, he had
been clean for quite awhile.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.980
And he overdosed.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.816
In one of the back bedrooms.

31:59.818 --> 32:05.422
Now the second death, um, was
last year and that was, uh, Kelley's dad.

32:05.556 --> 32:07.457
Now he was 89,

32:07.459 --> 32:09.860
so I'm not so sure it had
something to do with the paranormal.

32:09.862 --> 32:14.164
She's convinced that
paranormal had a lot to do with it.

32:14.166 --> 32:16.934
He wasn't your typical
89-year-old man.

32:17.235 --> 32:18.568
Ah, got it.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.905
I actually have a picture
of her dad

32:21.907 --> 32:23.840
and this is your late brother,
as well, right?

32:23.842 --> 32:24.374
Correct.

32:28.313 --> 32:29.346
Oh.

32:30.915 --> 32:34.184
Okay, I had a sketch done
of the person that I saw.

32:35.420 --> 32:36.353
Okay.

32:36.854 --> 32:37.921
[papers rustling]

32:43.628 --> 32:45.228
Holy [bleep]. Um...

32:46.698 --> 32:48.265
Tell me who you think
this looks like.

32:54.639 --> 32:55.706
It kind of looks like Danny.

32:57.475 --> 33:00.544
- [Steve] Danny was your brother, correct?
- Yes.

33:00.546 --> 33:03.680
<i>[Steve] Can you tell Amy the
circumstances with him passing?</i>

33:03.682 --> 33:06.383
He passed away of a
heart attack at the age of 55.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.019
[Steve] Now how long ago
was that?

33:09.021 --> 33:11.755
Eleven months
after my husband died.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.958
- [Steve] So 2008?
- Ah, 2008, yes.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.426
Amy, you thinking
her brother's still here?

33:18.963 --> 33:20.263
Yes.

33:24.969 --> 33:28.638
So the next person I'm going
to talk about is an older female.

33:28.640 --> 33:29.606
Mmm.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.475
[Amy] This female may
not be deceased.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.710
She may be in the dying process.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.446
So I was confused
on if she was dead or dying.

33:36.448 --> 33:38.815
I kept hearing 78 with her.

33:38.817 --> 33:41.418
- She seemed very frail and confused.
- Oh, my God.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.854
I got some things also
going on with the heart.

33:43.856 --> 33:47.224
Uh, and there's a lot
of nausea associated with her.

33:48.893 --> 33:50.293
You guys think
what I'm thinking?

33:50.795 --> 33:54.197
My mother, um, is 71 years old.

33:54.665 --> 33:57.968
She went in
for open heart surgery

33:57.970 --> 33:59.936
and suffered a stroke
on the operating table.

33:59.938 --> 34:03.040
Is she mentally okay?

34:03.241 --> 34:04.408
Yeah, no, she's not.

34:04.642 --> 34:05.575
Okay.

34:05.643 --> 34:07.878
All right, so, Amy,
we're pretty convinced

34:07.880 --> 34:11.815
it's Kelley's mom, who's alive,
that you're dealing with here.

34:11.817 --> 34:13.050
- Yeah.
- [Amy] I'm sorry.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.953
<i>[Steve] I hate to even ask,
but what else?</i>

34:17.989 --> 34:20.924
Now this is where things
get a little unusual.

34:20.926 --> 34:24.828
I saw a woman who was younger.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.764
She looked like your mother,
but younger.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.300
Looking into a mirror
with a candle

34:30.302 --> 34:34.404
and I, she was saying something
into the mirror and I could not hear it.

34:34.406 --> 34:42.245
When she did that, she inadvertently
opened up a doorway through the mirror.

34:42.247 --> 34:49.586
And now there's quite a few dead people
that kind of hang out in the mirrors.

34:49.588 --> 34:54.624
This is very concerning because
they can draw energy in from you, okay?

34:54.626 --> 34:57.327
And that's what makes them
negative, all right?

34:57.329 --> 35:00.864
You guys may see people
when you look in the mirrors

35:00.866 --> 35:05.202
or you may catch people in
movement out of the corner of your eyes.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.404
Concerning any mirror
in the house.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.539
So you saw a reflection
in the window.

35:09.541 --> 35:14.578
Yes, I was washing baby
bottles and I was looking down

35:14.580 --> 35:18.615
and I had, like, glanced up
above, you know, the window.

35:18.617 --> 35:22.319
And I seen this old lady, she was
standing on this side, right behind me.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.922
I totally got creeped out.
I was like, "Hell no."

35:25.924 --> 35:29.392
[Steve] Tell Amy how you were able to
find out who this woman was that you saw.

35:29.394 --> 35:31.862
We were looking through
old family photos one time,

35:31.864 --> 35:36.299
and I happen to see that lady
that I seen standing behind me.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.935
And I asked my mom who that was

35:38.937 --> 35:42.139
and she had mentioned
that that was her grandma.

35:42.907 --> 35:44.574
- So your great-grandmother.
- Yes.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.243
Was she ever in the house?

35:46.245 --> 35:49.813
Oh, yeah. She was
there, like, every day.

35:49.815 --> 35:54.251
The thing that worried me was
what I did see coming out of the mirror.

35:54.785 --> 35:56.286
I just called it the thing.

35:57.321 --> 36:00.857
It can come and go, never alive.

36:00.859 --> 36:07.130
Very bizarre-looking. Its skin
was like, uh, burned-looking.

36:07.132 --> 36:08.398
This thing is no good.

36:08.733 --> 36:11.001
Very bad.

36:11.003 --> 36:16.473
It also takes energy like the
bad dead people, but more so.

36:16.475 --> 36:17.941
Tell her about being lethargic.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.443
I feel like that all the time.
Tired, drained.

36:20.578 --> 36:23.914
Energy sucked out of me.

36:23.916 --> 36:30.353
The other thing that it's doing is it
can pick pieces of your personality out

36:30.988 --> 36:32.422
and also your memories.

36:33.658 --> 36:35.792
- So when she said
the thing-- - Uh-huh.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.028
You and I kind of looked
at each other.

36:38.030 --> 36:41.064
Well, that's exactly
what I call it. The thing.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.666
Exactly.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.602
- Are you having any memory problems?
- [Kelley] Yes.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.837
You guys kind of looked
at each other

36:47.839 --> 36:50.574
when Amy mentioned about taking
a piece of people's personalities.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.108
What was that about?

36:53.444 --> 36:56.046
-What's up, Jennifer? Don't hold back.
-[Jennifer laughs]

36:56.048 --> 37:01.918
Well, she's totally different
when she's here. Totally different.

37:01.920 --> 37:06.323
She's not herself. Like,
she gets mad very easily.

37:07.592 --> 37:09.159
[crickets chirping]

37:09.161 --> 37:14.598
When I walked upstairs, I went
into the bedroom to the right.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.399
That's Sara's room.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.435
<i>[Amy] The female, living
female, that I got in there,</i>

37:18.437 --> 37:20.637
I feel has abilities.

37:20.639 --> 37:25.675
Because of her abilities, there's
actually another vortex in the closet.

37:25.677 --> 37:30.547
So what I saw going on up there,
were the dead coming from the closet

37:30.549 --> 37:33.350
surrounding the bed
of this person, this female.

37:34.385 --> 37:37.487
These are dead people
who want help.

37:37.489 --> 37:42.626
But the problem is I saw the
thing there, too, and it changed

37:42.628 --> 37:45.195
and it became much smaller
and it was crawling

37:45.197 --> 37:47.430
- into the bed with this person.
- [Kelley cries]

37:48.966 --> 37:53.003
I did have a sketch done of
what I saw happening up there.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.203
[papers rustling]

38:02.113 --> 38:05.115
[exhales] You're not
gonna like seeing this.

38:11.088 --> 38:13.089
That's really sad.

38:13.858 --> 38:14.958
[indistinct whispering]

38:15.660 --> 38:18.028
Creepy, it's creepy.

38:23.401 --> 38:26.603
Sara told you a story about something
and crawling into her bed with her.

38:26.605 --> 38:30.240
Well, she came in, told me
in the morning, she asked me,

38:30.242 --> 38:33.443
"Hey, by any chance,
did you get in bed with me?"

38:35.413 --> 38:36.913
And I said, "No, I didn't."

38:36.915 --> 38:38.615
That's not good.

38:38.617 --> 38:42.018
I'm speechless, to
be honest with you. I...

38:43.387 --> 38:45.155
You wanted her to move out,
get the hell out of here.

38:45.157 --> 38:47.424
- Now you must really want her to leave.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

38:48.092 --> 38:49.392
[Jennifer] Yes, I do.

38:49.927 --> 38:51.361
Go pack your stuff now.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.233
[indistinct whispering]

39:07.545 --> 39:12.882
[Steve] Well, I can't remember the last
time Amy's seen so much stuff in one house.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.819
Clearly, it's a good thing
you guys called us in.

39:15.821 --> 39:20.957
Now the question is is there
anything you can do to fight back

39:20.959 --> 39:23.026
and keep the house
in your family?

39:23.028 --> 39:25.095
Well, for that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:29.133 --> 39:31.534
[Amy] You can stay.

39:31.536 --> 39:36.673
But there's a lot, a lot of
things that need to be done

39:36.675 --> 39:41.544
and on a consistent basis for you
to be able to stay here in peace.

39:41.546 --> 39:46.750
I'm going to bring in a group of
sensitives, including some mediums.

39:46.752 --> 39:52.455
The first thing that needs to happen is for
your brother to be moved on comfortably.

39:52.457 --> 39:55.759
That'll go fairly quickly
because he is very ready to go.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.862
[Steve] So, Amy, do you think
the house had anything to do

39:58.864 --> 40:00.230
with the death of Kelley's
father and husband?

40:00.232 --> 40:01.231
[Amy] No.

40:02.533 --> 40:04.300
Okay.

40:04.302 --> 40:10.840
The second thing that needs
to happen is the large vortex

40:10.842 --> 40:15.345
where this thing, uh, is
coming in and out of the mirrors,

40:15.347 --> 40:19.682
needs to be shut
and severed and sealed.

40:19.684 --> 40:24.387
So once that's done, they will
seal the other vortex upstairs.

40:24.789 --> 40:27.690
- In Sara's room.
- [Amy] Yes.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.693
Closing these vortexes will
keep the dead and the thing

40:30.695 --> 40:33.196
from coming inside your home.

40:33.198 --> 40:39.836
Next, there needs to be a barrier,
uh, placed around the house.

40:39.838 --> 40:47.076
Get a large bag of salt and take that
around the yard where your land ends.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.813
The shadow woman is going
to be pushed out,

40:49.815 --> 40:52.916
uh, past your,
uh, property line.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.285
Uh, so she won't be able
to get back in,

40:55.287 --> 40:57.253
once this barrier's put around.

40:59.089 --> 41:03.226
I want the barrier redone
every two weeks for a year.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.798
Well, that's a hell of a list.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.034
Is this worth you staying here?

41:13.003 --> 41:13.703
- Yes.
- [Steve] It is.

41:13.705 --> 41:14.838
Yes.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.072
But you would rather
see Mom leave.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.207
- [Jennifer] Of course.
- Yeah.

41:17.209 --> 41:18.775
- Uh-huh.
- [Steve] Yeah.

41:18.777 --> 41:24.247
- But... She's not, so just got to live with it, I guess.
- [Steve] Yeah.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.182
- Mothers are stubborn.
- [Jennifer] Mmm-hmm.

41:28.853 --> 41:32.622
<i>[Amy] I really hope Kelley follows
my advice by moving her brother on</i>

41:32.624 --> 41:36.226
<i>and closing the vortexes
inside her home.</i>

41:36.228 --> 41:40.096
Once she does that, she can
put a barrier around her property

41:40.098 --> 41:44.300
and live peacefully in the house her
father built for many years to come.

42:00.985 --> 42:02.986
[theme music playing]
