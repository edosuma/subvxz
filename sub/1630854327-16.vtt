<i>Throughout history,
traumatic experiences</i>

How do you have
so much energy?

00:18.087 --> 00:19.778
Didn't you get home at,
like, 3:00 a.m.?

00:19.881 --> 00:21.055
Exhaustion is a construct.

00:21.159 --> 00:24.955
Mind over matter.

00:25.059 --> 00:27.993
Stethoscopes or diplomas?

00:28.097 --> 00:29.753
No.

00:29.857 --> 00:31.238
Are those clip-ons?

00:31.341 --> 00:34.448
You cannot wear those
to stand up in my wedding.

00:34.551 --> 00:36.243
My dad likes to
commemorate accomplishments

00:36.346 --> 00:37.658
with formalwear.

00:37.761 --> 00:39.280
Your dad has
questionable taste.

00:39.384 --> 00:40.902
That's what my mom says.

00:41.006 --> 00:41.800
We're going shopping.

00:41.903 --> 00:43.284
My treat.

00:43.388 --> 00:44.561
Oh, since you're
treating us to things,

00:44.665 --> 00:45.769
can toilet paper be a treat?

00:45.873 --> 00:47.254
Because we're out.

00:47.357 --> 00:48.979
<i>Mesopotamian soldiers depicted</i>

01:01.371 --> 01:02.510
Doing anything tonight?

01:02.614 --> 01:04.340
Why?

01:04.443 --> 01:05.824
Well, there's a new bar
that opened in my neighborhood.

01:05.927 --> 01:07.791
It looks pretty cool.

01:07.895 --> 01:09.828
I give it about a week before
the tech bros take it over.

01:09.931 --> 01:11.692
Want to check it out?

01:11.795 --> 01:13.245
Sounds like a date.

01:13.349 --> 01:14.522
Nope, not a date.

01:14.626 --> 01:18.526
Just two coworkers
getting a drink.

01:18.630 --> 01:19.596
No, thanks.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.253
Hey, look.

01:21.357 --> 01:23.048
Would you really
rather be hanging out

01:23.152 --> 01:24.981
with your 80-year-old roommate
and her friends

01:25.085 --> 01:28.950
than get one drink with me?

01:29.054 --> 01:30.780
Yeah.

01:30.883 --> 01:31.643
<i>It's a lesson

01:31.746 --> 01:35.060

01:37.649 --> 01:40.445
<i>doesn't mean
the symptoms aren't real.</i>

01:40.548 --> 01:42.343
Hey, Scout.

01:42.447 --> 01:45.864
Should we show Jo and Luna what
we've been working on, huh?

01:45.967 --> 01:46.865
Let's do it.

01:46.968 --> 01:47.900
Ready?

01:48.004 --> 01:51.697
both: A, B, C, D--

01:51.801 --> 01:53.216
You've been learning
sign language?

01:53.320 --> 01:57.669
I-- I found an app that
teaches the ASL alphabet.

01:57.772 --> 01:59.636
Now your face is telling me
that I screwed up.

01:59.740 --> 02:00.879
Did I screw up?

02:00.982 --> 02:03.123
I told you
that I needed more time.

02:03.226 --> 02:04.848
We don't even have
her MRI results back,

02:04.952 --> 02:06.298
her genetic testing.

02:06.402 --> 02:10.509
You're-- you're
learning sign language?

02:15.480 --> 02:19.173
Ben, now, first you
save this man in a fire.

02:19.277 --> 02:21.002
Now you're sitting
at his bedside?

02:21.106 --> 02:24.074
You want me to sit with you?

02:24.178 --> 02:27.388
No, you-- you've got a crisis
of your own to deal with.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.531
We're going to
get through this.

02:32.635 --> 02:33.498
All of it.

02:33.601 --> 02:35.327
Yeah.

02:36.742 --> 02:38.434
Mm.

02:43.715 --> 02:45.751
What the--

02:48.064 --> 02:50.791
Well, who let you in here?

02:50.894 --> 02:53.207
Well,
I had to restock the PRT,

02:53.311 --> 02:56.521
so I thought I'd swing by
and say hi to you--

02:56.624 --> 02:59.455
hi-- and my favorite patient.

02:59.558 --> 03:01.388
You're so adorable, huh?

03:01.491 --> 03:02.941
Yes, you are.

03:03.044 --> 03:03.873
You couldn't get
supplies in Illinois?

03:03.976 --> 03:05.254
Well, I could.

03:05.357 --> 03:07.048
But Illinois just
doesn't have Connor, so--

03:07.152 --> 03:08.188
no, they don't.

03:08.291 --> 03:09.154
All right,
you've had your fun.

03:09.258 --> 03:10.431
My turn.

03:10.535 --> 03:11.743
Come on, up, up, up.

03:15.298 --> 03:16.541
Aw.

03:16.644 --> 03:18.439
How is his mom doing?

03:18.543 --> 03:20.372
Better every day.

03:20.476 --> 03:21.373
OK.

03:21.477 --> 03:22.581
Up now.

03:22.685 --> 03:23.548
Any pain there?

03:23.651 --> 03:24.928
No.

03:25.032 --> 03:25.895
Is there any way
to speed this up?

03:25.998 --> 03:26.999
There's somewhere I have to be.

03:27.103 --> 03:28.760
I'm going as fast as I can.

03:28.863 --> 03:30.244
Oh, Dr. Adams, Dr. Millin.

03:30.348 --> 03:31.763
This is Matt.

03:31.866 --> 03:32.902
I just cleared his C-spine,
and I just need

03:33.005 --> 03:33.937
you to get him up to CT.

03:34.041 --> 03:34.938
How'd you hurt yourself?

03:35.042 --> 03:36.077
Took a sword to the neck.

03:36.181 --> 03:37.458
A foam sword.

03:37.562 --> 03:39.495
It has a plywood core.

03:39.598 --> 03:42.152
LARPing accident.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.740
Why do you think
I would know what that is?

03:43.844 --> 03:45.984
Live-action roleplaying.

03:46.087 --> 03:47.848
The guys in the park
with the swords?

03:47.951 --> 03:49.953
Now I see why you
think I would know that.

03:50.057 --> 03:53.094
If his CT is negative, just
keep him here for observation,

03:53.198 --> 03:54.924
to make sure that
the swelling in his trachea

03:55.027 --> 03:56.443
doesn't compromise his airway.

03:56.546 --> 03:58.928
Page me if you need anything.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.136
Can I please just go now?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.103
I feel fine,
and this is my only shot

04:02.207 --> 04:03.760
to usurp the game master.

04:03.864 --> 04:06.867
If I don't get back to the
park before sunset, that's it.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.593
Well,
if your trachea swells up

04:08.696 --> 04:13.425
enough that air doesn't reach
your lungs, that is also it.

04:13.529 --> 04:15.496
Statistically, what are
the chances of that happening?

04:15.600 --> 04:18.050
Look, no disrespect,
but this game is make-believe.

04:18.154 --> 04:20.121
Is it worth risking
actual death?

04:20.225 --> 04:22.814
Depending on the statistics, maybe.

04:22.917 --> 04:24.954
Oh, I get it now.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.300
This is about a girl.

04:26.404 --> 04:28.716
Oh my god,
not everything is about love.

04:28.820 --> 04:30.235
Princess Astrid of Dungeness.

04:30.339 --> 04:32.064
See?

04:32.168 --> 04:33.480
Unbelievable.

04:33.583 --> 04:34.791
It was love at first sight.

04:34.895 --> 04:36.793
For six years, I've loved her.

04:36.897 --> 04:39.313
Today I shall declare it.

04:39.417 --> 04:40.487
She is my destiny.

04:44.732 --> 04:46.458
Good morning, Mr. Porter.

04:46.562 --> 04:47.735
I'm Dr. Webber.

04:47.839 --> 04:49.254
This is Dr. Yasuda.

04:49.358 --> 04:50.876
We're going to be doing
your colonoscopy today.

04:50.980 --> 04:52.499
Yasuda?

04:52.602 --> 04:54.259
Russell Porter, 31.

04:54.363 --> 04:56.572
Experiencing unintentional
weight loss and anemia.

04:56.675 --> 04:59.091
Has a family history
of colon cancer.

04:59.195 --> 05:01.266
Referred by his PCP
for a diagnostic colonoscopy.

05:01.370 --> 05:03.889
Are you doing OK?

05:03.993 --> 05:04.856
He doesn't like hospitals.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.306
I'm fine.

05:06.409 --> 05:07.307
Well, in about 15 minutes,
you're not

05:07.410 --> 05:08.584
going to know where you are.

05:08.687 --> 05:10.102
It will be the best nap
of your life.

05:10.206 --> 05:11.311
Sounds great.

05:11.414 --> 05:12.519
Can I get a colonoscopy too?

05:15.280 --> 05:16.212
Where are we?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.903
We're in the hospital, baby.

05:18.007 --> 05:20.078
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:20.181 --> 05:21.251
Get this off of me.
- Look, Russell--

05:21.355 --> 05:22.667
- Get it off!
- Russell, you're OK.

05:22.770 --> 05:23.909
Who are you?

05:24.013 --> 05:25.048
What-- what's happening?

05:25.152 --> 05:26.326
Why doesn't he
remember who I am?

05:26.429 --> 05:27.741
Let's forget about
the colonoscopy.

05:27.844 --> 05:29.121
And let's get a head CT.

05:29.225 --> 05:30.399
And page Dr. Shepherd, OK?
- Yeah.

05:30.502 --> 05:31.710
Hi, I'm Dr. Yasuda.

05:31.814 --> 05:33.022
Do you want to
just come with me--

05:33.125 --> 05:34.610
Get away from me.
Don't come near me!

05:34.713 --> 05:36.715
OK. Oh my god.

05:36.819 --> 05:38.614
Get away from me.

05:38.717 --> 05:40.029
Get away from me.

05:56.632 --> 05:57.598
Any nausea?

05:57.702 --> 05:59.393
Oh, yeah.

05:59.497 --> 06:01.291
And the pain on your side
on a scale of 1 to 10?

06:01.395 --> 06:04.260
7 most days, 9 on a bad day.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.987
It's got to be stones, right?

06:07.090 --> 06:09.714
I've always had trouble
with my kidneys.

06:09.817 --> 06:11.232
What kind of trouble?

06:11.336 --> 06:12.544
Had the right one
removed several years back.

06:12.648 --> 06:14.374
But the pain
is currently on the right?

06:14.477 --> 06:15.616
Left.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.618
I had the left one removed.

06:17.722 --> 06:19.068
Oh, I'm getting old.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.139
Let's take a look.

06:21.242 --> 06:23.831
Hey, is Dr. Bailey
working today?

06:23.935 --> 06:25.730
I was looking on the internet.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.801
It says she's the best doctor
here for kidney problems.

06:27.904 --> 06:29.250
Think I could see her?

06:29.354 --> 06:31.805
She's busy,
but I'll put in a page.

06:31.908 --> 06:33.738
In the meantime,
we'll take some urine

06:33.841 --> 06:35.498
samples and some images,
and we'll know more.

06:35.602 --> 06:37.397
Oh, thanks.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.467
I just don't want to mess
around with the only kidney

06:38.570 --> 06:42.022
I have left, you know?

06:52.273 --> 06:54.034
What are you doing?

06:54.137 --> 06:56.416
Exercise.

06:56.519 --> 06:58.038
Tox screen is negative.

06:58.141 --> 07:01.041
Bloodwork only shows anemia
and mild renal impairment.

07:01.144 --> 07:02.870
Hmm.

07:02.974 --> 07:04.872
Grace said Russell's
been experiencing

07:04.976 --> 07:06.011
some brain fog lately.

07:06.115 --> 07:08.428
Pretty mild, until today.

07:08.531 --> 07:10.326
She chalked it up
to a stress at work.

07:11.603 --> 07:12.604
Ah.

07:12.708 --> 07:17.022
Well, head scans are negative.

07:17.126 --> 07:18.714
Are those
what I think they are?

07:23.373 --> 07:26.791
Russell, we see some
bullets in your scan.

07:26.894 --> 07:27.861
When did you get shot?

07:27.964 --> 07:31.140
11 years ago.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.901
Went to the grocery store
for taco seasoning,

07:34.005 --> 07:36.007
came out with three
gunshot wounds.

07:36.110 --> 07:37.457
Can you imagine?

07:37.560 --> 07:38.906
Surviving a shooting
and then having

07:39.010 --> 07:40.460
to walk around
with metal inside you

07:40.563 --> 07:41.875
for the rest of your life?

07:41.978 --> 07:43.566
What were his symptoms, again?

07:43.670 --> 07:46.431
Anemia, fatigue, weight loss.

07:46.535 --> 07:50.573
And now he's exhibiting
brain fog, confusion.

07:50.677 --> 07:52.333
I'll-- I'll go test
his lead levels.

07:52.437 --> 07:53.265
Put a rush on it.

08:00.445 --> 08:02.827
He's been off the oscillator
for three days now,

08:02.930 --> 08:05.036
and they're minimizing
the vent settings.

08:07.590 --> 08:10.904
You're still getting calls?

08:11.007 --> 08:14.217
You know, someone's
heart stops on my table,

08:14.321 --> 08:16.426
I'm cool as a cucumber.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.428
But the phone rings, and I--

08:18.532 --> 08:19.429
shake.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.500
I-- I shake.

08:20.603 --> 08:21.846
Because it's terrifying.

08:21.949 --> 08:24.676
They're harassing you,
and it's relentless.

08:24.780 --> 08:28.438
Ben almost died on duty
the other day, again.

08:28.542 --> 08:33.789
So terrifying
in my life has layers.

08:33.892 --> 08:36.032
Like, when the phone rings,
I don't know what I should

08:36.136 --> 08:37.068
be panicking about first.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.244
And it never stops ringing.

08:41.348 --> 08:45.214
I just hope
to god these lunatics

08:45.317 --> 08:47.147
will move on before I have
a second heart attack.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.424
Wait a minute.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.459
You had a heart attack?

08:49.563 --> 08:51.116
How did I not know about this?

08:51.220 --> 08:52.773
When?

08:52.877 --> 08:53.912
Years ago.

08:54.016 --> 08:56.156
It-- look, it's-- it's fine.

08:56.259 --> 08:57.433
I'm fine.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.574
Everything is fine.

09:00.678 --> 09:02.783
If you're using
fine as a stand-in

09:02.887 --> 09:04.613
for another four-letter word,
I can get

09:04.716 --> 09:06.166
on board with that analysis.

09:06.269 --> 09:07.236
OK.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.996
Nothing's fine.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.516
This helps, though.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.242
Yeah.

09:13.345 --> 09:17.418
Well, I find there's not
much that a roomful of babies

09:17.522 --> 09:20.111
can't fix.

09:20.214 --> 09:24.667
And old friends.

09:24.771 --> 09:27.497
This is Dr. Hunt,
our head of trauma surgery

09:27.601 --> 09:29.499
and an expert at
treating gunshot victims.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.122
I don't understand.

09:31.225 --> 09:32.364
What does this have
to do with his colon?

09:32.468 --> 09:33.814
Nothing.

09:33.918 --> 09:36.506
As it turns out,
based on his bloodwork,

09:36.610 --> 09:38.854
Russell has lead poisoning.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.338
The bullet fragments
in his chest

09:40.441 --> 09:42.202
and his spine have
been leaching lead

09:42.305 --> 09:44.756
into his bloodstream
and his spinal fluid.

09:44.860 --> 09:46.793
That explains all
of your symptoms--

09:46.896 --> 09:49.485
the intermittent confusion,
the forgetfulness.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.452
Just like the episode
you had earlier today.

09:51.556 --> 09:53.938
But the surgeon said it was
riskier to take the bullets

09:54.041 --> 09:55.111
out than to leave them in.

09:55.215 --> 09:56.492
Most of the time
that is true.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.667
The body forms scar tissue
around the bullets,

09:58.770 --> 10:00.600
preventing lead from
getting into the blood

10:00.703 --> 10:02.049
and the spinal fluid.

10:02.153 --> 10:04.638
But in some cases,
like yours, that scar tissue

10:04.742 --> 10:08.504
never forms and the best course
of action is to remove them.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.127
So you remove the bullets
and my symptoms just go away?

10:11.231 --> 10:13.613
Within a few days,
your lead levels will drop

10:13.716 --> 10:15.580
and your symptoms will
gradually improve.

10:15.684 --> 10:17.306
And what about his confusion?

10:17.409 --> 10:18.583
There are no guarantees.

10:18.687 --> 10:21.206
It could take weeks,
months, even years

10:21.310 --> 10:24.485
for the encephalopathy
to subside, if at all.

10:24.589 --> 10:26.211
So I can go through
all this and still

10:26.315 --> 10:27.592
can't remember who my wife is?

10:27.696 --> 10:29.145
Hey, it's OK.

10:29.249 --> 10:31.216
I'm not going anywhere.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.150
I'll just keep
reminding you, OK?

10:34.254 --> 10:38.914
When I heard the gunshots,
I was in the cereal aisle.

10:39.017 --> 10:41.848
I tried to find
a place to hide,

10:41.951 --> 10:42.849
but there was nowhere to go.

10:42.952 --> 10:43.850
It was a grocery store.

10:43.953 --> 10:47.163
I was totally exposed.

10:47.267 --> 10:48.820
So I got down on my knees,
and I prayed

10:48.924 --> 10:52.410
that I'd make it out alive.

10:52.513 --> 10:55.620
But if I would have known
how much I'd suffer--

10:55.724 --> 10:58.554
I know that feeling, Russell.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.626
Listen, I am a survivor
of a shooting too.

11:01.730 --> 11:02.903
Too many of us are.

11:03.007 --> 11:04.560
It is a lifelong
struggle whether you

11:04.664 --> 11:05.906
remove those bullets or not.

11:06.010 --> 11:07.770
So in a way,
you have nothing to lose.

11:07.874 --> 11:09.772
And who knows-- if
we can take away

11:09.876 --> 11:12.395
some of your physical
pain maybe that

11:12.499 --> 11:15.019
could help take away some
of your other pain too.

11:20.196 --> 11:23.544
OK.

11:23.648 --> 11:24.925
Let's take them out.

11:25.029 --> 11:27.065
- OK.
- OK.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.415
Dr. Shepherd?

11:32.519 --> 11:35.625
It's Mika Yasuda
from Grey Sloan.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.938
Dr. Hunt and Dr. Webber
told me to come get you.

11:38.042 --> 11:39.560
We need a neuro consult.

11:42.322 --> 11:44.496
Also, I really have to pee.

11:52.263 --> 11:53.609
Bathroom's over there.
- You know what?

11:53.713 --> 11:55.093
It was a false alarm.
I'm good.

11:55.197 --> 11:56.094
Should we get you dressed?

11:56.198 --> 11:57.130
Because-- wait, wait!

11:57.233 --> 11:59.580
Ow!

11:59.684 --> 12:01.479
Dr. Hunt says I can't
leave without you.

12:01.582 --> 12:03.723
Call the backup
neurosurgeon on call.

12:03.826 --> 12:06.173
We have a patient
with a bullet embedded

12:06.277 --> 12:07.692
in his thoracic spine.

12:07.796 --> 12:09.659
It has to come out.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.696
Dr. Hunt says you're the
only one who can do it.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.767
Please.

12:13.871 --> 12:15.458
- Fine.
- Great.

12:15.562 --> 12:16.908
Uh, my van is out front.

12:17.012 --> 12:18.289
You have to kind of,
like, lift and kick

12:18.392 --> 12:19.669
the door at the same time.
But you know what--

12:19.773 --> 12:21.602
I'll drive myself.

12:21.706 --> 12:22.603
I'll see you there!

12:28.920 --> 12:29.818
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:29.921 --> 12:30.819
What are you doing here?

12:30.922 --> 12:32.130
You hate pregnant women.

12:32.234 --> 12:33.373
Don't say that.

12:33.476 --> 12:35.824
It makes me sound
like an awful person.

12:35.927 --> 12:38.827
But I do feel hives coming on.
- Yeah.

12:38.930 --> 12:42.140
Uh,
I'm just checking on you.

12:42.244 --> 12:45.281
Well, I am waiting
for Luna's test results

12:45.385 --> 12:47.628
to determine whether
her hearing loss is due

12:47.732 --> 12:48.768
to an underlying disease.

12:48.871 --> 12:51.218
Yeah, I know.

12:51.322 --> 12:53.220
At daycare this morning,
there was this mom,

12:53.324 --> 12:55.498
and she was fighting
with her kid

12:55.602 --> 12:56.948
about taking off
his bike helmet.

12:57.052 --> 12:59.709
And I just--
I just wanted to scream,

12:59.813 --> 13:02.195
"This is not a real problem."

13:02.298 --> 13:05.336
And I know it's all relative.

13:05.439 --> 13:08.339
And the truth is,
is, I would love it

13:08.442 --> 13:10.720
if my biggest problem
right now was Luna refusing

13:10.824 --> 13:12.239
to take off her bike helmet.

13:12.343 --> 13:15.795
Yeah, and don't we want
to encourage helmet wearing?

13:15.898 --> 13:19.074
I'm going to stop trying
to make you laugh.

13:19.177 --> 13:20.972
I might have all of
these decisions to make--

13:21.076 --> 13:22.767
hearing aids,
cochlear implants,

13:22.871 --> 13:24.217
sign language,
things that will affect her

13:24.320 --> 13:25.356
for the rest of her life.

13:25.459 --> 13:27.530
And it's not like
I can just ask her

13:27.634 --> 13:29.532
what she wants in 20 years.

13:29.636 --> 13:32.673
My job as a mom just changed
in the blink of an eye,

13:32.777 --> 13:34.779
and I don't know if I'm
going to be very good at it.

13:34.883 --> 13:37.851
I'm not a parent,
but I do have to deal with

13:37.955 --> 13:39.542
the parents of my patients
a lot.

13:39.646 --> 13:41.924
So I'm kind of an expert.

13:42.028 --> 13:45.031
And what I know is that you
are not only good at it,

13:45.134 --> 13:46.377
you are great.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.344
And you're going
to continue being great.

13:48.448 --> 13:50.243
You are a great mom.

13:52.072 --> 13:53.867
Thanks.

13:53.971 --> 13:56.697
Oh, and um, if you need
help with sign language,

13:56.801 --> 13:59.804
I do know happy birthday,

13:59.908 --> 14:04.913
my name is Levi, and, um, butt.

14:06.328 --> 14:07.777
There.
I did it.

14:07.881 --> 14:08.917
My work here is done.

14:18.719 --> 14:20.480
Watch where you're going!

14:20.583 --> 14:22.275
What?

14:22.378 --> 14:23.310
What?

14:23.414 --> 14:25.623
Hey.

14:25.726 --> 14:28.488
Did Meredith tell you
to come check on me?

14:28.591 --> 14:29.799
No.

14:29.903 --> 14:31.663
I was actually
worried about Bailey.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.113
Why do I need to check on you?

14:33.217 --> 14:34.874
Uh, you know,
I'm-- it's fine.

14:34.977 --> 14:36.392
Hey!
Come on, Amelia.

14:36.496 --> 14:37.428
It's me.

14:37.531 --> 14:39.085
Spit it out.

14:39.188 --> 14:43.572
Um, Mer moved,
and then Maggie moved,

14:43.675 --> 14:45.885
and then Kai left me.

14:45.988 --> 14:50.268
And so I've, um, pretty much
been abandoned by everyone.

14:50.372 --> 14:52.512
And you know how well
I do with abandonment, so...

14:52.615 --> 14:53.962
Amelia.

14:54.065 --> 14:56.585
I have a consult.

14:58.414 --> 15:00.071
We need to remove
the spinal bullet first

15:00.175 --> 15:02.004
since it's most likely
causing the encephalopathy.

15:02.108 --> 15:03.626
What about the scattered
fragments in the lung?

15:03.730 --> 15:05.628
Can we do a
non-anatomic resection

15:05.732 --> 15:06.698
of the affected lung tissue?

15:06.802 --> 15:07.768
Yeah, good.

15:07.872 --> 15:09.080
Please, go ahead.

15:09.184 --> 15:10.357
Start without me.

15:10.461 --> 15:11.772
We did.

15:11.876 --> 15:13.188
Sorry, I got here
as fast as I could.

15:13.291 --> 15:16.363
My van doesn't go over 45,
and I'll--

15:16.467 --> 15:17.917
I'll stop talking now.

15:18.020 --> 15:20.022
Assuming you can remove
the bullet in the spine--

15:20.126 --> 15:21.610
Assuming I can?

15:21.713 --> 15:22.956
You woke me up.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.165
I assume that you know
that I can.

15:25.269 --> 15:27.719
Amelia, we really don't have
time for whatever this is, OK?

15:27.823 --> 15:29.100
You'll go first.

15:29.204 --> 15:30.446
We'll remove the
bullet from the spine,

15:30.550 --> 15:32.276
irrigate, close,
and flip the patient,

15:32.379 --> 15:33.863
and then I'll start
the thoracotomy.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.486
Anything else I should know?

15:35.589 --> 15:39.283
Did you want to pick
the music for the OR as well?

15:39.386 --> 15:41.043
Are there any other options
you would like to discuss,

15:41.147 --> 15:42.044
Dr. Shepherd?

15:42.148 --> 15:43.390
Nope.

15:43.494 --> 15:46.324
Dr. Ndugu seems to be
in charge here.

15:46.428 --> 15:48.223
Let's go with his plan.

15:53.331 --> 15:54.229
OK.

15:54.332 --> 15:55.333
Was that--

15:55.437 --> 15:56.231
Definitely not about you.

15:56.334 --> 15:57.404
All right.

15:57.508 --> 15:58.888
OK.

15:58.992 --> 15:59.959
Are you experiencing
an increase in pain?

16:00.062 --> 16:00.960
Nope.

16:01.063 --> 16:02.478
I feel great.

16:02.582 --> 16:03.721
Whoa.

16:03.824 --> 16:04.687
Whoa, where are you going?

16:04.791 --> 16:06.068
To the park.

16:06.172 --> 16:07.138
Do you know where my shoes are?
- Hey, no.

16:07.242 --> 16:08.553
We need to keep you
a little longer,

16:08.657 --> 16:09.899
just to make sure
you're out of the woods.

16:10.003 --> 16:10.831
You're really going to
make me wait a full week

16:10.935 --> 16:11.832
to tell Astrid I love her?

16:11.936 --> 16:13.006
What's one more week?

16:13.110 --> 16:14.904
Today when I almost died--

16:15.008 --> 16:16.251
It was a foam sword.

16:16.354 --> 16:17.183
I fought to
keep breathing with

16:17.286 --> 16:18.563
every molecule in my body.

16:18.667 --> 16:19.979
I couldn't let myself die
without telling

16:20.082 --> 16:21.221
Astrid how I feel.

16:21.325 --> 16:23.706
You probably think it's crazy,
but I

16:23.810 --> 16:25.329
don't even know her real name.

16:25.432 --> 16:28.228
But I know her smile, and I
know what makes her laugh,

16:28.332 --> 16:29.712
and I know her heart.

16:29.816 --> 16:31.404
And I have to tell her.

16:31.507 --> 16:33.199
Oh, you are full
of adrenaline right now.

16:33.302 --> 16:34.786
You are not thinking clearly.

16:34.890 --> 16:36.409
Or maybe he's thinking
clearly for the first time

16:36.512 --> 16:38.687
in his entire life.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.861
I mean, what if you go to
the park and Princess Astrid

16:40.965 --> 16:42.760
doesn't feel the same way?

16:42.863 --> 16:43.864
Or maybe she's been in love
with you this whole time too.

16:43.968 --> 16:45.349
Yeah, I prefer his take.

16:45.452 --> 16:47.868
Stop encouraging him.

16:47.972 --> 16:51.631
This game is clearly your--

16:51.734 --> 16:53.771
your happy place.

16:53.874 --> 16:57.706
Do you really want to trash
all of that for a girl whose

16:57.809 --> 16:59.742
real name you don't even know?

16:59.846 --> 17:03.781
You look like a princess, but
you have the heart of an ogre.

17:03.884 --> 17:06.197
Correction--
I look like a goddess,

17:06.301 --> 17:08.061
and I have the heart
of a person who

17:08.165 --> 17:10.719
tells sad men the whole truth.

17:10.822 --> 17:11.961
Or a troll.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.274
She has the heart of a troll.

17:14.378 --> 17:16.828
I'll give you your shoes
back when I discharge you.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.666
The urinalysis and X-ray
both came back negative.

17:26.769 --> 17:28.288
Next steps?

17:28.392 --> 17:29.565
Run an ultrasound to fully
rule out kidney stones.

17:29.669 --> 17:30.601
Good.

17:30.704 --> 17:32.154
What do you need me for?

17:32.258 --> 17:33.742
He said he only
had one kidney,

17:33.845 --> 17:35.330
but there are clearly
two in the films

17:35.433 --> 17:37.090
and he doesn't have
any surgical scars.

17:37.194 --> 17:39.955
Also, he asked for you.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.853
I told him you were busy, but--

17:41.957 --> 17:45.064
Is it-- hello, sir.

17:45.167 --> 17:46.617
I'm Dr. Bailey.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.343
Go ahead, Kwan.

17:48.446 --> 17:49.999
Been looking forward
to meeting you.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.242
I'm, uh, flattered.

17:51.346 --> 17:53.693
Dr. Kwan is one of
our finest interns.

17:53.796 --> 17:55.315
He's going to be
doing an ultrasound--

17:55.419 --> 17:56.592
How are the kids?

17:56.696 --> 17:57.869
Oh.

17:57.973 --> 17:58.939
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:59.043 --> 17:59.940
Have I treated you before?

18:00.044 --> 18:01.010
No, no, no, no, no.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.496
Just a-- just a fan.

18:07.465 --> 18:09.640
How's the new place?

18:09.743 --> 18:11.883
Boys settling in OK?

18:11.987 --> 18:13.299
Excuse me?

18:13.402 --> 18:15.163
Young Pruitt's
been through so much.

18:15.266 --> 18:18.545
I mean, it would be a real,
real shame if something else

18:18.649 --> 18:20.064
were to happen.

18:22.515 --> 18:23.964
Ultrasound is negative.

18:24.068 --> 18:25.725
Uh, you can discharge him now.

18:25.828 --> 18:27.106
Oh, now, hang on.

18:27.209 --> 18:28.348
Is that how you
treat your patients?

18:28.452 --> 18:30.523
Sir, sit back-- sit down.

18:30.626 --> 18:32.628
Or do you only
extend common courtesy

18:32.732 --> 18:34.492
to other murderers, huh?

18:34.596 --> 18:36.080
Come back here.

18:36.184 --> 18:38.220
I'm not finished with you,
Dr. Baby Killer!

18:41.258 --> 18:42.121
Call security!

18:42.224 --> 18:43.156
Hey!

18:43.260 --> 18:45.331
This isn't over!

18:45.434 --> 18:46.642
Just stay down.

19:03.003 --> 19:06.041
You know,
I thought we were friends.

19:06.145 --> 19:11.667
Or at least colleagues
who respected each other.

19:11.771 --> 19:14.014
Amelia, what is going on?

19:16.016 --> 19:18.433
What's going on is,
you let one of the only people

19:18.536 --> 19:20.573
in the world who cares
whether I eat a hot meal

19:20.676 --> 19:22.402
or sleep for more
than four hours in a night

19:22.506 --> 19:24.335
move to Chicago.

19:24.439 --> 19:27.890
You know as well as I do
that no one let Maggie move.

19:27.994 --> 19:30.617
You're her husband,
and you let your ego destroy

19:30.721 --> 19:31.929
what was once true love.

19:32.032 --> 19:33.517
OK.

19:33.620 --> 19:36.727
I get that she's your sister,
so there are sides here.

19:36.830 --> 19:38.418
But that is
an oversimplification.

19:38.522 --> 19:42.526
Maggie will rise
and rise and rise,

19:42.629 --> 19:45.149
and she will go on to do
even greater things,

19:45.253 --> 19:48.221
and you will always be
in her shadow.

19:48.325 --> 19:50.568
And she may go on to forgive
your smallness,

19:50.672 --> 19:53.951
because that is how great
she is, but I'm not.

19:54.054 --> 19:55.090
I won't.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.449
If you need
anything to make sure

20:09.553 --> 20:11.831
that Dr. Bailey is covered at
all times, just say the word.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.005
Thank you.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.249
Chief Altman,
I wanted to apologize

20:16.353 --> 20:17.733
for attacking that patient.

20:17.837 --> 20:19.390
I know there are protocols
in these situations--

20:19.494 --> 20:20.771
The patient wasn't attacked.

20:20.874 --> 20:22.566
He fell while he was
attacking Dr. Bailey.

20:22.669 --> 20:23.981
Um--

20:24.084 --> 20:25.638
That is the story
as I heard it.

20:25.741 --> 20:28.399
So this won't go
in my file somewhere?

20:28.503 --> 20:30.090
I'm confused.

20:30.194 --> 20:31.816
Did something happen between
you and the abusive patient?

20:31.920 --> 20:34.163
If so, I know nothing about it.

20:38.927 --> 20:39.755
Is that him?
Is that him?

20:39.859 --> 20:40.825
Yes.

20:40.929 --> 20:42.448
But, Warren, listen to me.

20:42.551 --> 20:44.657
We both know that that won't
help either of you, OK?

20:44.760 --> 20:45.830
That intern over there,
he's the one

20:45.934 --> 20:47.763
who took the bastard down.

20:47.867 --> 20:49.834
Why don't you put this manic
energy to better use and go

20:49.938 --> 20:53.182
over there and thank him?

20:53.286 --> 20:55.012
- Fine.
- OK, great.

20:55.115 --> 20:56.634
But if you wouldn't
mind telling the bastard

20:56.738 --> 20:58.809
that Dr. Bailey's husband
is a firefighter who breaks

20:58.912 --> 21:00.604
into houses
with his ax for a living,

21:00.707 --> 21:02.537
and I'm going to find out where
he lives, I'd appreciate it.

21:02.640 --> 21:03.503
OK, I got it.

21:03.607 --> 21:04.504
I got it.

21:04.608 --> 21:07.438
Thank you.

21:07.542 --> 21:10.890
Yasuda, slowly retract
to help expose the dura.

21:13.686 --> 21:14.652
I need better visualization.

21:14.756 --> 21:16.861
Retractor.

21:16.965 --> 21:18.622
Yasuda.

21:18.725 --> 21:19.864
I'm so sorry.

21:19.968 --> 21:20.900
I don't know what happened.

21:21.003 --> 21:22.660
I'll tell you what happened.

21:22.764 --> 21:24.006
You were not paying attention,
and our last sterile retractor

21:24.110 --> 21:25.214
is on the floor.
Pick it up--

21:25.318 --> 21:26.457
OK.

21:26.561 --> 21:27.527
and get out of my OR.

21:27.631 --> 21:28.804
Is that really necessary?

21:28.908 --> 21:30.150
We can get a replacement
in one minute.

21:30.254 --> 21:31.290
Do you want
to be kicked out too?

21:31.393 --> 21:33.084
I really am so sorry.

21:33.188 --> 21:34.085
It won't happen again.

21:34.189 --> 21:35.363
Not with me, it won't.

21:35.466 --> 21:37.365
You are no longer
welcome on my service.

21:37.468 --> 21:38.573
Out!

21:53.070 --> 21:54.071
Is he--

21:54.174 --> 21:55.244
He's doing great.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.660
Dr. Shepherd
successfully removed

21:56.763 --> 21:58.178
the bullet from his spine.

21:58.282 --> 21:59.835
She's finishing up,
and then Dr. Ndugu will start

21:59.939 --> 22:01.078
on the fragments in his lung.

22:01.181 --> 22:02.838
OK.

22:02.942 --> 22:03.770
That's good, right?

22:03.874 --> 22:04.771
Very good.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.532
OK.

22:06.635 --> 22:11.191
I'm sorry.

22:11.295 --> 22:12.261
I'm sorry.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.401
No.
No apologies.

22:16.438 --> 22:18.267
It'll be a few hours
if you want

22:18.371 --> 22:19.717
to go home and get some sleep.

22:19.821 --> 22:22.686
You know, he never told
me what happened that day.

22:22.789 --> 22:25.896
We were newlyweds, and he calls
me from the hospital saying

22:25.999 --> 22:28.864
he was grocery shopping
and a guy comes in

22:28.968 --> 22:31.764
and just opens fire.

22:31.867 --> 22:34.422
And that's all he ever said.

22:34.525 --> 22:39.427
He didn't want to talk about
it, he didn't want to feel it.

22:39.530 --> 22:43.879
But I knew he did, because we
were planning on having kids.

22:43.983 --> 22:47.227
And then after that day,
we weren't.

22:53.993 --> 22:58.238
I've tried so many times
to talk to him about it,

22:58.342 --> 23:00.309
because how can
somewhat live with all

23:00.413 --> 23:03.071
that trauma inside of them?

23:03.174 --> 23:07.731
I always worried
that it was eating away

23:07.834 --> 23:10.354
at him emotionally, you know?

23:10.458 --> 23:12.183
I never thought that it could
be killing him

23:12.287 --> 23:13.840
slowly, physically.

23:13.944 --> 23:17.465
We're going to make sure
that does not happen.

23:17.568 --> 23:19.777
Sorry.

23:19.881 --> 23:21.158
I know you're busy.

23:21.261 --> 23:22.677
Go.
Go, go.

23:22.780 --> 23:23.747
It's OK.

23:23.850 --> 23:26.681
I have a few minutes.

23:26.784 --> 23:28.683
Thank you.

23:33.515 --> 23:36.518
Hey.

23:36.622 --> 23:38.002
Hot chocolate.

23:38.106 --> 23:41.661
Figured you could use
some good juju.

23:45.941 --> 23:48.047
If you wanted something else,
you could have just said so.

23:48.150 --> 23:51.015
Thought that
would make me feel better.

23:54.502 --> 23:55.503
OK.

23:55.606 --> 23:57.470
Come on.

23:57.574 --> 23:58.506
Yell at me.

23:58.609 --> 24:00.439
Pretend I'm him or them.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.371
All of them.

24:02.475 --> 24:03.994
What do you want to say?
Yell it at me.

24:04.097 --> 24:05.547
No, I'm not--

24:05.651 --> 24:08.239
Miranda, he knew
your daughter's full name.

24:08.343 --> 24:11.967
He knew my daughter's
full name.

24:12.071 --> 24:14.211
He threatened my child.

24:16.524 --> 24:21.908
You-- you would hurt
a four-year-old girl

24:22.012 --> 24:24.186
in the name of life?

24:24.290 --> 24:28.432
As if you give two craps
about life or about children

24:28.536 --> 24:30.710
or about the welfare
of any other human other than

24:30.814 --> 24:32.332
your own self-righteous--

24:36.440 --> 24:39.098
I mean, as if you actually
cared about making

24:39.201 --> 24:40.479
the world a better place.

24:40.582 --> 24:42.066
As if-- as if you
listen to anything

24:42.170 --> 24:44.034
your own religion tells you.

24:44.137 --> 24:45.725
But you would hurt a child--

24:45.829 --> 24:47.209
my child-- for what?

24:47.313 --> 24:49.729
Just to prove a point?

24:49.833 --> 24:51.938
And then you have the nerve
to call yourself pro-life?

24:52.042 --> 24:54.009
Well, shame on you.

24:54.113 --> 24:56.011
No, you are what
is wrong in this world.

24:56.115 --> 25:01.016
Not me, not my family, not
my child, you sick son of a--

25:01.120 --> 25:03.467
No. No.

25:03.571 --> 25:04.572
Because my mother
used to say,

25:04.675 --> 25:08.472
"Kill 'em with kindness,
Miranda."

25:08.576 --> 25:11.026
I just wish that I could

25:11.130 --> 25:16.515
kill them with the truth.

25:16.618 --> 25:19.138
Maybe there's a way
we can do both.

25:22.486 --> 25:25.109
He was a huge guy, and I--

25:25.213 --> 25:27.905
I should have been scared,
but all I could think about

25:28.009 --> 25:29.493
was saving Bailey.

25:29.597 --> 25:31.806
You're so brave.

25:31.909 --> 25:33.083
Look at her.

25:33.186 --> 25:34.636
She's practically salivating.

25:34.740 --> 25:35.775
And over Kwan?

25:35.879 --> 25:36.949
Yeesh.

25:37.052 --> 25:38.502
- You jealous?
- No.

25:38.606 --> 25:39.952
Hmm,
kind of seems like you are.

25:40.055 --> 25:41.574
I'm embarrassed for her.

25:41.678 --> 25:43.611
It's not a character flaw
to want to be with somebody.

25:43.714 --> 25:45.302
Are we still
talking about me,

25:45.405 --> 25:46.993
or are we talking
about you now?

25:59.730 --> 26:00.904
We lost his airway.

26:01.007 --> 26:02.664
Code blue!
- We'll get him on oxygen.

26:02.768 --> 26:04.355
Come on, man. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

26:04.459 --> 26:06.254
<i>Code blue. Code blue.</i>

26:06.357 --> 26:07.842
No pulse.

26:07.945 --> 26:09.602
We need to intubate him now.
Start CPR.

26:09.706 --> 26:10.672
All right.

26:10.776 --> 26:11.673
Starting cardiac compressions.

26:11.777 --> 26:14.434
All right.

26:14.538 --> 26:15.470
<i>Code blue.</i>

26:15.574 --> 26:17.127
<i>Code blue.</i>

26:17.230 --> 26:18.128
There's too much swelling.

26:18.231 --> 26:19.439
I can't visualize the cords.

26:19.543 --> 26:20.613
We need to crike him.

26:20.717 --> 26:21.683
We're interns.

26:21.787 --> 26:22.960
We have to wait
for Dr. Schmitt.

26:23.064 --> 26:24.203
Page Dr. Schmitt.
Page everyone.

26:24.306 --> 26:25.756
I can't do this.
I can't watch him die.

26:25.860 --> 26:26.826
We'll be fired!

26:26.930 --> 26:28.172
You can leave if you want to.

26:28.276 --> 26:29.277
I'm saving his life.

26:29.380 --> 26:30.209
<i>Code blue.</i>

26:30.312 --> 26:31.520
<i>Code blue.</i>

26:31.624 --> 26:35.145
There's a crike tray
in the drawer.

26:38.976 --> 26:39.839
All right, but wait.
We should put an IV bag

26:39.943 --> 26:40.944
underneath his
shoulder blades.

26:41.047 --> 26:42.601
I saw Dr. Hunt do it.

26:42.704 --> 26:45.396
It'll open up his neck.

26:46.501 --> 26:47.398
<i>Code blue.</i>

26:47.502 --> 26:49.400
<i>Code blue.</i>

26:53.646 --> 26:56.545
Does anybody see Dr. Schmitt?

26:56.649 --> 26:57.788
OK, let's do it.

26:57.892 --> 26:59.583
Just don't kill him.

27:08.937 --> 27:10.145
Thank you, Dr. Shepherd.

27:10.249 --> 27:13.217
We'll update you
when we're finished.

27:16.151 --> 27:18.671
She's angry
that my wife left me.

27:18.775 --> 27:20.052
Doesn't seem quite fair.

27:20.155 --> 27:22.641
When Amelia is angry,
she is rarely fair.

27:22.744 --> 27:23.676
Yeah.

27:23.780 --> 27:24.815
All right, Griffith.

27:24.919 --> 27:25.816
Talk me through this.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.093
What's the move?

27:27.197 --> 27:30.165
Use the cautery
to demarcate the line,

27:30.269 --> 27:32.167
and then pass over it
with the GIA stapler.

27:32.271 --> 27:33.375
Good.

27:33.479 --> 27:34.583
Now show me.

27:34.687 --> 27:36.068
You want me to do it?

27:36.171 --> 27:37.276
With all due respect,
are you sure?

27:37.379 --> 27:38.622
Dr. Pierce always said that--

27:38.726 --> 27:39.727
Dr. Pierce doesn't
work here anymore,

27:39.830 --> 27:40.693
and I think you're ready.

27:43.765 --> 27:46.354
GIA stapler.

27:53.844 --> 27:56.709
Position the stapler,
and fire it.

28:03.923 --> 28:04.890
Uh, the edge is bleeding.

28:04.993 --> 28:06.650
OK.
How do you stop it?

28:09.653 --> 28:10.758
Ndugu,
there are multiple bleeders.

28:10.861 --> 28:11.862
Maybe you should take over now.

28:11.966 --> 28:12.932
Hunt, kindly back off.

28:13.036 --> 28:14.278
Griffith, listen to me.

28:14.382 --> 28:15.694
If you stop now,
the next time this happens,

28:15.797 --> 28:17.247
you'll panic even more.

28:17.350 --> 28:18.558
You can do this, all right?
I know you can.

28:18.662 --> 28:19.628
Just focus.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.873
Take a deep breath and think.

28:22.977 --> 28:25.117
2-0 vicryl on a pass, stat.

28:25.220 --> 28:26.808
Forceps.

28:31.571 --> 28:33.159
Come on.

28:33.263 --> 28:36.991
Come on. Come on.

28:37.094 --> 28:38.578
Sutures are holding.

28:38.682 --> 28:39.648
Well done.

28:39.752 --> 28:42.479
Let's proceed.

28:47.795 --> 28:50.280
Is he going to be OK?

28:50.383 --> 28:53.283
When something goes wrong,
your job is to page me and do

28:53.386 --> 28:54.663
nothing until I get there.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.113
I paged code blue,
but he was dying, so--

28:56.217 --> 28:57.805
Is he OK?

28:57.908 --> 29:00.083
I need to be sure that you
understand that if he doesn't

29:00.186 --> 29:02.154
make it, your career is over.

29:02.257 --> 29:04.087
All that training for nothing.

29:04.190 --> 29:05.847
All you had to do
was wait two minutes.

29:05.951 --> 29:07.193
He didn't have two minutes.

29:07.297 --> 29:08.816
If Adams hadn't stepped
in he would be in a coma

29:08.919 --> 29:10.162
right now or worse.

29:10.265 --> 29:11.991
It's tough enough
to pay back student

29:12.095 --> 29:14.718
loans when you are a doctor.

29:14.822 --> 29:18.135
When they pull your license
because you sliced

29:18.239 --> 29:20.724
a patient's neck with no
one there to supervise you,

29:20.828 --> 29:22.933
it's way harder.

29:23.037 --> 29:24.866
You did the crike well.

29:24.970 --> 29:27.627
You saved his life.

29:27.731 --> 29:28.525
I'm admitting him to the ICU.

29:28.628 --> 29:29.526
Oh, thank god.

29:29.629 --> 29:31.700
Oh my god.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.012
That fear you're feeling?

29:33.116 --> 29:36.567
Remember it next time
and wait.

29:39.950 --> 29:43.782
Um,
thanks for sticking up for me.

29:43.885 --> 29:45.784
Well, we couldn't let him
die without declaring his love

29:45.887 --> 29:47.820
for a fictional character.

29:47.924 --> 29:49.063
What's your deal?

29:49.166 --> 29:52.860
Are you really just,
like, anti-love?

29:52.963 --> 29:54.723
I went to med school
in Colorado.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.553
I had a crush
on a guy in O-chem,

29:56.656 --> 29:57.865
and that's where he was going.

29:57.968 --> 29:59.798
My mom encouraged me,
because according to her

29:59.901 --> 30:01.351
love is not only everything,

30:01.454 --> 30:04.147
it is the only thing.

30:04.250 --> 30:06.252
And first semester,
I failed gross anatomy,

30:06.356 --> 30:08.220
because I was
at his birthday party

30:08.323 --> 30:10.187
instead of studying
for my final--

30:10.291 --> 30:11.879
his birthday party
where he called me Jane

30:11.982 --> 30:13.501
and then made out
with my best friend

30:13.604 --> 30:14.813
at the end of the night.

30:14.916 --> 30:17.056
My grades recovered,
but surgical internships

30:17.160 --> 30:18.782
are so competitive.

30:18.886 --> 30:21.612
That's why I'm in the program
for rejects and losers.

30:21.716 --> 30:23.856
Because my parents
taught me to value

30:23.960 --> 30:27.066
an obsessive crush
over my grades and my medical

30:27.170 --> 30:29.241
school aspirations.

30:29.344 --> 30:31.001
Have you ever thought
that maybe there's

30:31.105 --> 30:33.038
a difference between
a stupid, obsessive crush

30:33.141 --> 30:34.763
and actual love?

30:34.867 --> 30:36.593
You sound exactly
like my mother.

30:41.736 --> 30:44.049
Oh, hey.

30:44.152 --> 30:48.536
You will not believe what I
have been dealing with today.

30:48.639 --> 30:50.055
You OK?

30:50.158 --> 30:52.920
We removed, uh--

30:53.023 --> 30:55.405
bullet fragments
from a mass shooting

30:55.508 --> 30:57.096
survivor today.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.650
And while we were in the OR,
there were two more shootings.

31:06.002 --> 31:09.246
I-- I don't recognize
our country anymore.

31:09.350 --> 31:11.283
Weapons of war
in grocery stores,

31:11.386 --> 31:17.289
at parades and schools, active
shooter drills in third grade.

31:17.392 --> 31:19.981
We used to be horrified,
you know?

31:20.085 --> 31:21.258
We used to grieve as a nation.

31:21.362 --> 31:24.399
But now-- now it
happens so frequently,

31:24.503 --> 31:26.091
we don't even blink.

31:26.194 --> 31:28.956
And nothing changes.

31:29.059 --> 31:32.304
And I feel hopeless.

31:38.793 --> 31:40.105
Hey.

31:40.208 --> 31:41.658
So I have an idea.

31:41.761 --> 31:44.626
You're either going
to love it or hate it.

31:47.664 --> 31:49.942
Dr. Shepherd, I just want
to reiterate how sorry I am.

31:50.046 --> 31:52.531
You lost focus while I had
my hands inside a man's back.

31:52.634 --> 31:55.637
He is the one that you
should be apologizing to.

31:55.741 --> 31:57.329
He is the one who trusted
you while he was unconscious

31:57.432 --> 31:58.709
on an operating table.

31:58.813 --> 31:59.918
You don't let yourself
get distracted when

32:00.021 --> 32:01.160
people are depending on you.

32:01.264 --> 32:02.851
When they are
vulnerable and scared,

32:02.955 --> 32:05.095
that is when you give them
everything that you've got.

32:05.199 --> 32:07.546
That is when you stay
alert long enough not

32:07.649 --> 32:10.376
to drop a sharp metal
object while someone's

32:10.480 --> 32:11.481
spine is exposed.

32:11.584 --> 32:13.793
I-- I didn't drop it in him--

32:13.897 --> 32:15.105
I'm sorry,
you're defending yourself?

32:15.209 --> 32:16.727
What is wrong with you?

32:16.831 --> 32:17.797
I'm really asking.

32:17.901 --> 32:20.352
Yasuda, what is wrong with you?

32:20.455 --> 32:21.905
Do I really need
to answer that?

32:22.009 --> 32:22.871
No, you don't, Yasuda.

32:22.975 --> 32:23.907
You can go.

32:24.011 --> 32:26.323
You, come with me.

32:26.427 --> 32:27.807
- Addie?
- Richard.

32:27.911 --> 32:28.877
Uh, yeah.

32:28.981 --> 32:30.293
I'll find you later, OK?

32:35.712 --> 32:37.714
Are you high?

32:37.817 --> 32:38.749
No.

32:38.853 --> 32:39.750
Is that the truth?

32:39.854 --> 32:41.200
No, I'm not high.

32:41.304 --> 32:42.236
Are you using again?

32:42.339 --> 32:43.409
No.

32:43.513 --> 32:44.755
I can't sleep, I--
I can't eat.

32:44.859 --> 32:45.825
I am a wreck.

32:45.929 --> 32:46.965
I am not using. God.

32:47.068 --> 32:48.897
OK, great.

32:49.001 --> 32:50.520
Then I'm going to go ahead and
love you enough to tell you

32:50.623 --> 32:53.557
to pull your head out of
your self-obsessed ass

32:53.661 --> 32:56.353
and get to an AA meeting,
because the world

32:56.457 --> 32:57.941
is already on fire.

32:58.045 --> 32:59.494
We don't need you burning
anything else down, all right?

32:59.598 --> 33:01.358
And I know you're in
pain, and I know that you

33:01.462 --> 33:02.773
feel it more than most.

33:02.877 --> 33:06.018
But get to a meeting,
say a damn prayer,

33:06.122 --> 33:09.263
call your sponsor, then eat
something and figure out a way

33:09.366 --> 33:13.405
to be of service
to this broken world,

33:13.508 --> 33:15.372
instead of adding
to everyone's pain.

33:15.476 --> 33:17.409
Because it starts with you
trashing everybody else,

33:17.512 --> 33:22.759
and it ends with you back in
rehab again, if you're lucky.

33:22.862 --> 33:26.349
No one has abandoned you,
Amelia, OK?

33:26.452 --> 33:29.766
Everyone is just doing
the best that they can.

33:29.869 --> 33:33.701
I love you, and everyone else
is just barely surviving,

33:33.804 --> 33:35.772
and it has nothing
to do with you.

33:35.875 --> 33:38.085
I love you, and you need
to make the decision

33:38.188 --> 33:39.638
to stop the spiral.

33:39.741 --> 33:41.778
And if you can't do it,
you need to find someone,

33:41.881 --> 33:43.435
get someone
to help you stop it.

33:49.441 --> 33:51.443
I love you, Amelia.

33:51.546 --> 33:54.722
And you've got to
get off the damn ride

33:54.825 --> 33:56.413
before it's too late.

34:02.109 --> 34:05.008
I know that we've all been
worried about Dr. Bailey.

34:05.112 --> 34:10.220
What she is going through
is frightening and invasive,

34:10.324 --> 34:13.016
and how it's not against
the law is beyond me.

34:13.120 --> 34:16.502
What I do know is that it
is easier to hurt a stranger

34:16.606 --> 34:18.159
than someone you know.

34:18.263 --> 34:21.956
Dr. Kwan is handing out
lists of Dr. Bailey's

34:22.060 --> 34:24.027

34:24.131 --> 34:26.685
If you're wondering
what you can do, call them.

34:26.788 --> 34:27.755
Talk to them.

34:27.858 --> 34:29.791
Be respectful, be kind.

34:29.895 --> 34:31.483
Be familiar.

34:31.586 --> 34:33.174
