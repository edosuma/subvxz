WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:07.518
- What kind of message

00:07.570 --> 00:10.869
Are we trying to give
Soldiers in the fields

00:10.920 --> 00:13.002
- Oh, thanks Shona.

00:13.050 --> 00:15.575
Are you sure you're gonna be OK
flying to Italy all by yourself?

00:15.620 --> 00:18.054
- I'm no_t a child.
- I never said you were.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.614
- And there will be a pilot.
- Of course there will be.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.661
But honey... I'm a father.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.144
It's my job to worry.
- I know.

00:25.190 --> 00:28.068
And thanks. It must be hard
watching your little girl

00:28.110 --> 00:30.066
grow up, flying off
to Europe by herself

00:30.110 --> 00:32.419
with nothing but last year's
clothes on her back.

00:32.460 --> 00:35.896
- I see what you did there.
And honey,

00:35.940 --> 00:37.726
just because you flash
those pearly whites at me

00:37.770 --> 00:39.590
does not mean that I'm gonna...

00:41.730 --> 00:44.381
Fine. I give up.
- Ah ha!

00:44.430 --> 00:47.479
- Here. Take it all.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.909
- Ah! Grazie mille!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.521
- I'll hit Queen after school.
- OK, honey. Have fun.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.697
I love you, baby.
- Ciao, Papa.

00:55.750 --> 00:57.877
- Hey.

00:57.920 --> 01:00.138
I can't.
Angie just called,

01:00.190 --> 01:02.579
she wants me to go meet
a couple of friends of hers.

01:02.620 --> 01:05.839
- Public transit it is, then.
- A little time with the
common man would probably

01:05.890 --> 01:07.187
do you some good.
- See you in a bit.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.664
- See you, Shona.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.494
- Hey!
- Hi.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.586
Why do you
smell like strawberries?

01:14.630 --> 01:16.507
- It's my hair. I ran out

01:16.550 --> 01:18.506
of the usual conditioner.
- Very fruity.

01:18.550 --> 01:20.859
- You're not helping.
- Oh, hey!

01:20.900 --> 01:22.811
I'm going right by
that cool soap shop on Queen.

01:22.860 --> 01:26.034
I love their
Rainforest Revival. Would you?

01:26.080 --> 01:28.207
- Yeah, no problem! I'll swing
by the agency after I'm done.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.478
- You are a lifesaver.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.899
- Il piacere tutto mio

01:33.960 --> 01:36.861
- Le... plume de ma tante!

01:41.230 --> 01:43.221
: There it is!

01:43.270 --> 01:45.226
Wayward Wally Brewery.
- Little early to be

01:45.270 --> 01:47.488
hittin' the suds, isn't it?
- It's noon somewhere.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.701
Reykjavik?

01:53.630 --> 01:56.281
- We're not going to day drink.
I wanted to introduce you

01:56.330 --> 01:58.412
to the brothers who run it.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.246
- Yeah, from
the old neighbourhood.

02:00.290 --> 02:03.202
- Oh. So who is this Wally
who went Wayward and why?

02:03.250 --> 02:05.150
- Their dad. One day,
he just up and left.

02:05.210 --> 02:07.166
- Seems an odd thing
to commemorate.

02:07.210 --> 02:10.077
- Yeah. The guys found a recipe
for an IPA in their dad's

02:10.130 --> 02:12.598
old stuff, figured they'd give
it a go and five years later,

02:12.650 --> 02:14.424
they've just
won a Golden Tap Award.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.472
- Well, that's impressive.
- Yeah! They're great
guys. I thought

02:17.520 --> 02:19.476
you'd like to meet them.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.260
- And they could
use a celebrity endorsement,

02:22.310 --> 02:24.619
and the only celebrity I know--
!

02:24.660 --> 02:26.742
- Yeah. I use the term
"celebrity" loosely.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.576
- No, no. It's
on the record now.

02:28.620 --> 02:30.531
As a celebrity,

02:30.580 --> 02:32.400
I feel it would
be irresponsible of me

02:32.450 --> 02:34.270
to endorse a product
that I couldn't

02:34.320 --> 02:36.185
stand behind fully.
And you also need to know

02:36.240 --> 02:38.936
that I have
a very sophisticated palate.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.448
- You're gonna like their beer.
And you'll like Miles and Dylan.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.287
They're hardworking, friendly...

02:44.330 --> 02:47.549
- Miles, how could
you do this to us?!

02:47.600 --> 02:49.898
- Well, I'm not the one
who closed up last night!

02:49.950 --> 02:52.339
- You heard what he said, Miles.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.200
Negligence!
- Well, maybe we can get

02:54.260 --> 02:56.899
a second insurance inspection.
- Hey, guys.

02:56.950 --> 02:58.861
What's going on?
- Oh, Angie. Miles forgot to

02:58.910 --> 03:02.038
lock off the valves last night.
- They were locked up
before I left.

03:02.090 --> 03:04.308
- Then explain to me
why thousands of gallons of beer

03:04.350 --> 03:06.170
have gone down the drain.
- I don't know, Dylan.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.962
Maybe somebody broke in and
opened the valves.

03:09.010 --> 03:12.662
- Are you saying this
was intentional?

03:12.710 --> 03:14.575
- Prove it.
- He doesn't have to.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.576
We will.

03:16.630 --> 03:20.327
Angie,
that would be amazing.

03:20.370 --> 03:23.498
- Uh... guys, we'd be happy to
help you, but why don't you

03:23.550 --> 03:25.768
just file an insurance claim?
- We tried. You just passed

03:25.810 --> 03:28.449
the adjustor on the way in.
He's calling it negligence.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.375
- Yeah, which means
we're out of pocket.

03:30.420 --> 03:32.638
- So you just brew more beer!
- It's gonna take at least

03:32.690 --> 03:35.033
two weeks to get a fresh batch,
and we had...

03:35.080 --> 03:37.332
contracts that were
expecting delivery today.

03:37.390 --> 03:40.769
- Not to mention we lost
about 30 grand In product.
That kills the reno plans.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.345
- You guys were
planning to expand?

03:43.390 --> 03:45.699
- Yeah. After we won the Golden
Tap, we scored a contract

03:45.740 --> 03:48.049
to supply the upcoming
Summerfest Music Festival.

03:48.090 --> 03:50.820
- The plan was to expand into
the rest of the building...

03:50.880 --> 03:54.520
and increase production by 30%.

03:54.580 --> 03:57.879
The_dre_am was
an experiential brew pub.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.886
- Looks like that's
down the drain too.

03:59.930 --> 04:02.581
- Well, not if Angie
and Matt here

04:02.630 --> 04:05.360
can prove that it
was a targeted attack, right?

04:05.410 --> 04:07.287
- So what time did you
close up last night?

04:07.330 --> 04:09.844
- I did the final taste test
at... 9PM.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.721
- I got in at 7 to find
the place completely flooded.

04:12.770 --> 04:14.988
- So that's
about a 10 hour window.

04:15.030 --> 04:18.295
- Speaking of windows,
what kind of security
system do you have here?

04:18.340 --> 04:21.070
- Well, we're strictly a lock-
and-key outfit at the moment.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.088
Have a look at this.

04:26.130 --> 04:29.304
- Yeah. The dust on the sill's
been disturbed.

04:29.350 --> 04:31.261
- There's scratch marks
on the latch.

04:31.310 --> 04:35.303
- So it was a break in.
- This won't be enough to

04:35.360 --> 04:38.318
convince the insurance company.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.147
- Our interest is... brewing.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.281
- I see you and you see me

04:50.330 --> 04:54.938
Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're makin' a scene

04:54.990 --> 04:58.289
Oh boy, you've got to know

04:58.340 --> 05:00.422
What my head overlooks

05:00.470 --> 05:03.462
The senses will show
to my heart

05:03.520 --> 05:09.163
When it's watching for lies
'cause you can't escape my

05:09.220 --> 05:12.303
- Private Eyes
They're watching you

05:12.350 --> 05:14.739
Private Eyes

05:14.790 --> 05:16.781
They're watching you,
watching you, watching you

05:16.830 --> 05:19.173
Watching you

05:27.190 --> 05:28.919
- Hope you didn't
mind me jumping in

05:28.980 --> 05:30.789
and offering our services.
- Oh, of course. If we can help

05:30.850 --> 05:32.841
the brothers out,
why wouldn't we?

05:32.890 --> 05:34.938
- Jerry's Rigs

05:34.980 --> 05:37.676
is in the same building
as Wayward Wally.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.631
- The boys' expansion plans
are pretty ambitious.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.466
They'd be taking over
the entire space.

05:41.510 --> 05:43.421
- And putting Jerry
out of business.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.519
- I wonder how Jerry
feels about that.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.916
Hey.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.609
Nice rig.
- Oh, thanks.

06:00.490 --> 06:03.835
All the kids nowadays
want side pipes

06:03.880 --> 06:05.654
and dual exhaust systems.

06:05.710 --> 06:08.144
I blame those damn

06:08.190 --> 06:10.363
Fast and Furiousmovies.

06:10.410 --> 06:13.493
I put my foot down on nitrous
oxide. Nobody needs that stuff.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.360
- The freedom of being
anindependent

06:15.410 --> 06:17.799
- My name's on the garage door
so I get to say what's what.

06:17.850 --> 06:21.240
Jerry. Oh.

06:21.290 --> 06:25.158
- So what do you say about
Wayward Wally's expansion plans?

06:25.210 --> 06:26.689
- You're not here
about a custom job, are you?

06:26.730 --> 06:29.244
- Everett and Shade.
We're private Investigators.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.461
We're looking into a break in
that happened next door.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.602
- A break in!

06:33.650 --> 06:36.642
And you think I did it?
- No. We're just asking around.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.998
- I've known those boys
for years.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.995
I worked with their father
in this very shop. Mind you,

06:41.050 --> 06:43.041
back then it was the whole
building, but... Itaught

06:43.090 --> 06:45.046
Wallace everything he knew.
- Sounds like you

06:45.100 --> 06:47.398
got a lot of history here.
- Oh, yeah.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.408
- I'd be pretty upset
if my life's work was being

06:50.450 --> 06:52.406
displaced by
a beer tasting room.

06:52.450 --> 06:56.056
- You're crazy!
I got a double wide

06:56.110 --> 06:57.884
_ _down in Florida _
waiting for me to retire.

06:57.930 --> 07:00.273
- So you're happy
about the expansion?

07:00.330 --> 07:02.230
- I'm thrilled!
In fact, the truth

07:02.290 --> 07:04.190
is I would've left years ago
except the boys were young and

07:04.240 --> 07:07.118
struggling and my rent covered
'em over a few rough spots.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.947
- Were you here
after 9PM last night?

07:09.990 --> 07:12.379
- Home every night by seven.
Wheel of Fortune.

07:12.430 --> 07:15.126
- Open at eight,

07:15.170 --> 07:17.161
like clockwork.
Although this morning

07:17.210 --> 07:19.166
when I came in, the boys
were yelling. I just thought

07:19.220 --> 07:21.472
they were brothers
being brothers.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.988
- Someone broke in, drained the
vats. They lost all their beer.

07:24.050 --> 07:26.610
- Damn. That's bad.
- Yeah.

07:26.660 --> 07:29.788
Maybe don't pack up
for Florida just yet.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.308
- Yeah.

07:35.410 --> 07:37.401
- So, what'd you think
of our Snowbird back there?

07:37.450 --> 07:39.714
- He doesn't strike me
as the cat burglar type.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.843
- If he wanted to go South so
bad, he could've gone any time.
Why sabotage the brewery now?

07:42.890 --> 07:45.541
- Why right after
their Golden Tap win?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.410
- Well, the local craft brew
scene's exploded in the last

07:47.460 --> 07:50.896
few years. Maybe someone's
at loggerheads with the new
kids on the block.

08:06.180 --> 08:09.138
- Just give me a second.

08:15.140 --> 08:17.096
- When we asked you
to start researching

08:17.140 --> 08:19.483
the local craft beer scene,
this isn't what we meant.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.576
- I did the research online.

08:21.630 --> 08:23.791
I just wanted
to be extra thorough.

08:23.850 --> 08:26.410
- Because you're dedicated
to your job.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.280
- You betcha!_The_re are a lot
of players in this game.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.457
But it's all _
about flavour profile.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.149
Now, there's filtered,

08:33.200 --> 08:35.156
unfiltered, seasonal, hoppy,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.599
wheaty--
- Grumpy, Sleepy.

08:37.640 --> 08:40.291
- It's a big, beautiful
beer world out there.

08:40.340 --> 08:43.559
- And here's a big, beautiful
black coffee to bring you
back to our world.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.956
- So, I narrowed it down
from the master list

08:48.000 --> 08:49.956
and came up with

08:50.000 --> 08:52.264
five different competitors.
And, unlike the trend

08:52.310 --> 08:55.825
of the last decade,
they're also not overly hoppy.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.519
- But you circled one.
- That's the one that makes

08:58.580 --> 09:00.832
the most sense: Girl on a Bike.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.008
I mean, I don't
usually drink beer

09:04.060 --> 09:06.403
or any alcohol of any sort,
but that's actually really good.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.366
- That's pretty good!
!

09:10.410 --> 09:13.629
- Ladies! It's not
even noon yet!
- It is in Halifax.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.059
- Other than flavour profile,

09:17.120 --> 09:19.372
what makes Girl on a Bike
a likely suspect?

09:19.420 --> 09:21.376
- They won the Golden Tap Award
the last three years

09:21.430 --> 09:23.330
in a row. This year
was their first loss.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.166
It was a pretty big upset.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.861
- Upset enough
to sabotage WawNard Wally?

09:27.910 --> 09:30.083
- Maybe the competition
between these rivals

09:30.130 --> 09:33.952
has finally come to a head.
- And you wonder why we drink.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.319
[indistinct speaking

09:44.670 --> 09:46.570
- You must be the girl
on a bike.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.838
- Rosie, master brewer
and owner.

09:48.890 --> 09:50.881
Have you had a sample?
- I would love one.

09:50.930 --> 09:54.058
- Nice logo.
- Thanks.

09:54.110 --> 09:57.409
It's also tattooed on my cheek.
- Ahh!

09:59.460 --> 10:02.805
- Three years running.

10:02.860 --> 10:05.112
- When is this year's
competition?

10:05.160 --> 10:08.038
- Ugh. It just happened.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.253
- No. Wayward Wally did. I don't
agree with the judging,

10:10.300 --> 10:12.348
but the brothers
worked hard for it.

10:12.390 --> 10:14.642
- Yeah, except all that hard
work is now down the drain.

10:14.700 --> 10:16.782
Literally.
- Oh, the lost batch.

10:16.830 --> 10:18.786
I heard about that.

10:18.830 --> 10:20.786
Rookie mistake. I thought Miles
was better than that.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.298
- He is. We think someone

10:23.360 --> 10:25.316
broke in and sabotaged the vats.
- Another competitor, maybe.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.091
No. No crafter
would do that to another.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.959
We're a community.
- Except business is business

10:31.020 --> 10:32.976
and the market'll_
only bear so many pints.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.809
- Wait.

10:37.850 --> 10:39.624
Who are you people?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.932
- Just a couple of beer lovers
trying to help out our friends.

10:41.980 --> 10:45.461
- Well, I would never
do that to Miles and Dylan.

10:45.510 --> 10:48.729
- Because crafters
are one big, happy family?
- And I have nothing to gain.

10:48.770 --> 10:51.648
- Not following you.

10:57.170 --> 10:59.513
Look, I'm not exactly
an independent brewer anymore.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.959
I sold out to Laughlin Brewers.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.082
But they're a--

11:04.140 --> 11:06.131
I know.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.967
I know. But after my third win

11:09.010 --> 11:10.830
in a row,
their acquisitions team

11:10.880 --> 11:13.792
kept coming around.
Wouldn't take no for an answer.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.274
- Well, not at first.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.402
But suddenly, my distributors
started falling off. I lost out

11:18.460 --> 11:20.621
on a couple big contracts.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.625
Outlets started denying me
shelf space.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.762
- And you think Laughlin
was responsible for that?

11:24.810 --> 11:27.119
- Well, I can't prove it.
All I know is that once

11:27.160 --> 11:30.334
I signed that paperwork,
all my problems evaporated.

11:30.380 --> 11:33.429
Laughlin Brewers wanna
take over the craft game

11:33.470 --> 11:35.426
from the inside out.
If anyone tried

11:35.470 --> 11:38.121
to mess with Miles and Dylan,
my money's on them.

11:38.170 --> 11:41.389
- Let's get down tonight

11:41.430 --> 11:43.432
I said

11:43.480 --> 11:45.607
Let's get down tonight

11:45.660 --> 11:47.605
I said, let's get on down

11:47.660 --> 11:49.742
Tonight

11:49.790 --> 11:51.655
- Maybe we should
just let her sleep.

11:51.710 --> 11:53.655
- No. I need her expertise.

11:53.710 --> 11:57.350
It'll be faster this way.

11:57.410 --> 11:59.366
WAKE UP!

12:04.240 --> 12:07.801
- I've got a plan,
but I need your help.

12:07.850 --> 12:10.853
- Here. This one's
a little more fruit forward.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.856
- All right. Good.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.549
- Do you two mad scientists
really think

12:14.600 --> 12:16.556
this is gonna work?
- Sure! It's just like

12:16.600 --> 12:18.852
_ when a wine maker_
mixes different grape varietals

12:18.910 --> 12:20.775
together to make a blend.

12:20.820 --> 12:24.165
- Except it's beer.
- Oh, ye of little faith.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.474
You wanna try it before we go?
- Definitely not.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.648
- Let's go.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.574
: Matt Shade!

12:35.620 --> 12:38.578
I'm surprised. I thought
you were more of a wine guy.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.576
- Oh, no. I still am,
but I have to admit

12:40.620 --> 12:42.622
the craft scene
has stolen my heart.

12:42.670 --> 12:44.535
- Guy Brant.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.582
- Oh, Sarah Piece.
Pleased to meet you.

12:46.630 --> 12:49.064
- Sarah's been working with me
and I think we've come up

12:49.110 --> 12:51.237
with something here
that is truly special.

12:51.290 --> 12:53.417
It's a delicate combination
of barley,

12:53.460 --> 12:55.769
malt, hops and a couple
of other things.

12:55.810 --> 12:59.109
- I'm perfectly content
to keep my little operation

12:59.160 --> 13:01.424
small and contained,
but Matt has been trying

13:01.470 --> 13:03.904
to convince me otherwise.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.906
- Well, with corporate backing,
we'd be able

13:05.950 --> 13:08.293
to focus our time on coming up
with new recipes.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.477
- Besides, rumour
is that Laughlin Brewers

13:10.520 --> 13:13.136
has been buying out
the independent breweries

13:13.180 --> 13:15.910
quite aggressively. I have
to admit, I wanted to see

13:15.960 --> 13:17.916
behind the curtain for myself.
- I can assure you, we respect

13:17.970 --> 13:19.915
the independent craft breweries
and what they bring

13:19.970 --> 13:22.871
to the market. That's why we're
so interested in growing our
craft profile.

13:22.930 --> 13:25.751
- Yeah. That's
good to hear, Guy.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.848
- So, uh... Girl on a Bike
is one of yours, correct?

13:27.890 --> 13:30.757
- You guys must
have an inside source.

13:34.070 --> 13:36.675
- Yes, it's true. Girl was one
of our acquisitions last year

13:36.720 --> 13:38.676
and we couldn't
be happier with them.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.858
- Even after they lost a Golden
Tap Award to Wayward Wally?

13:41.900 --> 13:44.368
- Who, incidentally, was just
the victim of vandalism.

13:44.430 --> 13:46.250
Wait. Do you know

13:46.300 --> 13:48.518
how bad the damage is?

13:48.560 --> 13:51.950
- No. They
haven't called me yet.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.128
- After Wayward won the Golden
Tap, we made them an offer.

13:55.180 --> 13:57.045
Miles asked for a few days
to think it over.

13:59.570 --> 14:02.130
But enough
about the competition.

14:02.180 --> 14:04.000
Let me get a taste of the beer

14:04.060 --> 14:06.620
Matt Shade is gonna
stake his reputation on.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.315
Ah ha ha!

14:14.460 --> 14:16.542
Interesting.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.154
Agh! Ugh!

14:21.200 --> 14:23.725
Yeah, you better
stick to wine there, Shadow.

14:25.730 --> 14:28.073
Shade?

14:28.120 --> 14:31.590
: So, Laughlin Brewers
made Miles an offer

14:31.650 --> 14:33.515
and he never mentioned it.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.471
- Neither did Dylan.
- Maybe Dylan doesn't know.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.988
- Why would Miles keep something
like that a secret?

14:38.050 --> 14:41.087
- Because he wants out and he's
afraid Dylan won't take
the deal.

14:41.140 --> 14:43.040
- And what better way
to force a sale

14:43.090 --> 14:45.172
than to sabotage
your own brewery?

15:00.980 --> 15:03.540
- Oh, hey.

15:03.590 --> 15:06.286
How's it going

15:06.340 --> 15:08.854
- Yeah, one. When were you

15:08.900 --> 15:10.902
gonna tell us about
the Laughlin Brewers offer?

15:13.170 --> 15:15.513
- Oh, you know.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.869
The one where they
offered to take you on

15:17.910 --> 15:21.823
under their craft umbrella.
Salary, swag, shiny new digs.

15:28.790 --> 15:30.838
- Come here.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.871
I'm sorry.

15:32.930 --> 15:34.966
I should've told you about it.

15:35.020 --> 15:37.830
Just... I know it's
been a tough five years

15:37.890 --> 15:40.279
and we both worked
our asses off. I just thought

15:40.330 --> 15:42.321
after the Golden Tap win
that we had a real shot.

15:42.370 --> 15:45.066
And I want this
just as bad as you do.

15:48.810 --> 15:50.983
Look, does Whitney
know about the offer?

15:51.030 --> 15:53.294
- Yeah...

15:53.340 --> 15:55.558
No. I know what you're thinking,
but no. There's no way

15:55.600 --> 15:57.556
she would do this.
- Dude, listen to me.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.511
You know I love Whit.
- Dude, no.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.551
- You can't deny that she wants
you to be rid of this place.

16:01.610 --> 16:03.771
_ I'm not _
haVIng this conversation.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.786
All right? I've got work to do.

16:14.450 --> 16:17.271
- When we started Wayward,
Whitney was super supportive.

16:17.320 --> 16:19.788
OK? Nobody really understood
the time commitment

16:19.840 --> 16:21.626
this place would take.
- She didn't sign up

16:21.670 --> 16:23.979
to never see her husband.

16:24.020 --> 16:26.102
- You really think she'd
do this to you guys?

16:26.150 --> 16:29.028
- I don't know. I don't...
You know what? Just...

16:29.070 --> 16:30.844
I'm sorry. I'm upset.
Just forget

16:30.900 --> 16:32.629
I said anything, OK?

16:32.680 --> 16:35.069
: Yeah.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.168
Dylan can shoot
his mouth off sometimes

16:37.210 --> 16:39.678
but he's not wrong.
- You realize

16:39.730 --> 16:41.686
what you're saying?
- Look, when the boys

16:41.730 --> 16:44.813
first moved in to their dad's
old shop, we were kids.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.031
It was fun,
but how was I supposed to know

16:47.090 --> 16:49.308
it would consume every
waking minute of Miles' life?

16:49.350 --> 16:51.818
- And the Laughlin Brewers offer
would free up all that time.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.963
- Yeah! The boys could take the
buyout and walk away,

16:55.010 --> 16:57.001
or take the perk package,
have the infrastructure

16:57.050 --> 16:59.006
to hire more bodies.
- And you'd get

16:59.060 --> 17:01.665
your husband back.
- Yeah. Well, I thought Miles

17:01.710 --> 17:04.053
should at least talk to Dylan
about the offer.

17:04.110 --> 17:06.055
- But he didn't. So you
popped by the brewery

17:06.110 --> 17:08.066
and opened the taps
to force his hand?

17:08.110 --> 17:10.806
! I would never do that!

17:10.850 --> 17:13.023
No. The decision
has to be Miles'.

17:13.070 --> 17:15.982
- Where were you last night
after 9PM?

17:16.030 --> 17:19.022
- I was at the office.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.332
- Ah... late.

17:21.380 --> 17:24.429
I was working. I'm a graphic
designer, so I freelance.

17:24.470 --> 17:27.030
- Can you be a little more
specific about the time?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.514
- I think I got in around 11.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.949
I really don't know, guys.
Are we done?

17:33.000 --> 17:36.390
- Sure. For now.

17:41.490 --> 17:44.573
I'd say we struck a nerve.
- Yeah.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.793
She was not working late
at the office.

17:46.840 --> 17:48.888
- So where was she
and why lie about it?

17:48.930 --> 17:50.750
- At the brewery,
opening the taps?

17:52.720 --> 17:54.676
- Not unless they
have valet parking.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.712
This is dated yesterday
but no company name.

17:57.770 --> 18:02.378
- Piece of cake. How many valet
companies can there be
in Toronto?

18:02.420 --> 18:05.639
57 companies

18:05.690 --> 18:08.079
_Can no one
park their own car anymore?

18:08.130 --> 18:10.200
- Ah, it won't be so bad.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.603
We'll split the list up.
Come on, there's three of us.

18:12.650 --> 18:15.733
- I love those
little red valet blazers.

18:15.790 --> 18:17.997
- OK, two and a half.

18:25.140 --> 18:29.144
- I'm so jealous.
I can't believe

18:29.190 --> 18:31.181
you get to go to Italy.
- Hey, you could've come too!

18:31.240 --> 18:33.140
- If I hadn't flunked science,
I'd be right there with you.

18:33.190 --> 18:35.533
I heard it's so easy
to get wine there!

18:35.590 --> 18:37.751
And all that pizza
and all those boys!

18:37.810 --> 18:39.766
Jealous, jealous, jealous.
- Yeah, Well, when you put it

18:39.810 --> 18:41.584
that way, it does
sound pretty great.

18:41.640 --> 18:43.631
- Oh, sorry!
- Sorry!

18:43.680 --> 18:48.379
- Jules.
- Liam.

18:48.430 --> 18:50.853
Um... How are you?

18:50.910 --> 18:52.775
- I'm... I'm... I'm fine.

18:52.820 --> 18:55.778
And you?
- I'm fine.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.957
Just doing some
last minute shopping.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.787
- Oh, for Italy.
- Yeah.

19:00.830 --> 19:05.005
- Just shopping. I just needed

19:05.050 --> 19:06.779
a new grip
for my lacrosse stick.

19:06.840 --> 19:11.220
- Cool.
- Yeah.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.147
- Uh... I should probably go.
- Yeah, me too. OK.

19:14.190 --> 19:18.103
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:19.890 --> 19:21.585
- Oh, my God. Is that

19:21.630 --> 19:23.541
the first time you guys have
talked since the big breakup?

19:23.590 --> 19:26.764
It is, isn't it?
- Um...

19:26.810 --> 19:30.109
- Wow. That was like... awkward,

19:30.160 --> 19:32.902
even for me just watching. Wow.

19:32.950 --> 19:34.850
- Yeah. You said that already.

19:34.910 --> 19:36.866
- Wow.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.866
Are you OK?

19:38.910 --> 19:41.435
- I don't know.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.485
- We know you weren't
at the office last night.

19:49.530 --> 19:51.612
- You valet parked your car
at a restaurant not too far

19:51.660 --> 19:54.094
from the brewery.
- Close enough to run back there

19:54.140 --> 19:56.483
and open some taps.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.496
- All right, fine. I lied.

19:58.540 --> 20:01.054
- So you did
sabotage the brewery?

20:01.110 --> 20:03.499
- No. I told you, no matter how
much that place drives me crazy,

20:03.550 --> 20:05.893
I would never do that to Miles.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.929
- I was having dinner with Evan.

20:10.990 --> 20:14.244
- The boys' uncle,
a guardian angel of sorts.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.109
He used to work
with their father and...

20:16.170 --> 20:19.037
really picked up the slack
when Wallace walked out.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.163
- So if you were just out
having dinner, why lie to us?

20:22.220 --> 20:24.165
- I don't know. I was...

20:24.220 --> 20:26.120
I was embarrassed, I guess.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.262
I'm trying to get Evan
on my side.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.222
- To try to convince Miles
to take the buyout?
- Yeah. He was one

20:31.270 --> 20:33.226
of the initial financers
for the brewery, so I figured

20:33.270 --> 20:35.352
if he could just
talk to Miles, then...

20:35.400 --> 20:39.404
Look, I don't... You should just
talk to Evan yourselves.

20:44.280 --> 20:46.271
: Thanks for coming
to meet us.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.286
- Oh, anything for the boys.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.413
They're my brother's kids and...
ever since their mom passed,

20:51.460 --> 20:54.247
we're all the family
we got left.

20:54.290 --> 20:56.679
- Whitney said that you two
were having dinner last night?

20:56.730 --> 20:58.630
- Yeah. She wants me
to talk to Miles

20:58.690 --> 21:01.386
about selling the brewery
to the big guns.

21:01.430 --> 21:04.035
- I said I'd try,

21:04.080 --> 21:06.082
but Miles is stubborn and...

21:06.130 --> 21:08.121
Dylan is too.

21:08.170 --> 21:10.126
They're fighters.
They didn't have that much

21:10.180 --> 21:11.659
of a childhood.
They had to grow up pretty fast.

21:11.700 --> 21:14.305
- You mean with their dad
walking out?

21:14.360 --> 21:16.567
- Well, this was my big brother
and my hero.

21:16.620 --> 21:20.135
Jerry and him and I, we spent
years working in that shop

21:20.190 --> 21:22.750
and then one day... he's gone.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.882
I was gutted.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.841
I can only imagine
what it was like for the boys.

21:29.890 --> 21:32.586
- Whitney said you were like
the boys' guardian angel?

21:32.630 --> 21:34.586
- Oh, yeah.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.540
Like, I try to help out
where I can.

21:36.590 --> 21:39.593
I made some good investments. I
helped get them through college.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.689
- And you loaned them the money
to start the brewery.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.982
- Yeah, I did and they
worked their butts off.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.168
I can't believe that somebody
just like, comes and tries
to destroy it all.

21:48.210 --> 21:51.475
- Do you know of any enemies
they might have?

21:51.520 --> 21:54.523
- No. They're local heroes.
I guess there's always somebody

21:54.570 --> 21:57.130
trying to stick it
to the good guy though, right?

21:57.180 --> 22:00.616
Oh! Well, here's
a local hero now.

22:00.660 --> 22:03.220
Hey, Dylan. What?

22:03.270 --> 22:05.352
OK. Hey. Calm down.

22:05.410 --> 22:07.833
Hey.

22:07.890 --> 22:11.018
Hey. Where are you?

22:11.060 --> 22:14.450
All right. I'll be right there.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.843
- Yeah. There was another
attack at the brewery

22:16.900 --> 22:18.800
and Miles has been hurt.
He's in the hospital.

22:31.260 --> 22:33.216
- That's quite the lump
you've got there.

22:33.260 --> 22:35.216
You sure you feel up to talking?

22:35.260 --> 22:38.047
- Oh, sure. It's my ego
that took the brunt of it.

22:40.270 --> 22:42.397
- Well, I was staying late
to finish up

22:42.440 --> 22:45.876
a batch so we could fulfill
our MUSIC Fest contract.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.263
I went to the back office
to do some paperwork.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.402
And then I heard a noise
out front.

22:50.450 --> 22:52.702
: Did you see anyone?

22:52.760 --> 22:54.921
- No. I went to check
on the vats,

22:54.980 --> 22:57.323
and... that's
when I got hit from behind.

22:57.370 --> 22:59.361
- When he didn't
answer his phone,

22:59.420 --> 23:01.376
I went over there.
Found him on the floor.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.856
Yeah, I thought for a moment--
- Hey, hey.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.243
Let's not go there.
- That damn brewery,

23:07.290 --> 23:09.201
Miles, is gonna kill you.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.468
- Hey. Come on, babe.
It's gonna

23:11.520 --> 23:14.034
take more than a hit to the head
to keep me down, all right?

23:14.080 --> 23:16.776
- Well, it's a good thing
you have a thick skull.

23:21.090 --> 23:23.342
- A total loss.
No.

23:23.400 --> 23:25.561
- Yeah. The coolant lines
are down,

23:25.620 --> 23:27.872
damaged beyond repair.
Air regulators,

23:27.920 --> 23:29.876
filtration systems, everything.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.831
- It was around 7PM.

23:32.880 --> 23:35.838
- It was a wrench.
I left it where I found it.

23:35.890 --> 23:37.790
- The police are sending over
a forensics unit

23:37.850 --> 23:39.932
to see what they can find.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.448
- That's all well and good
but you gotta start lookin'

23:42.500 --> 23:44.456
at the signs here, OK?
That old place is a jinx.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.546
All right?

23:46.590 --> 23:49.502
Maybe we gotta
seriously consider
the Laughlin Brewers offer.

23:49.550 --> 23:52.075
They're gonna set you up
in a new facility.

23:52.120 --> 23:54.076
It's a bigger profile.
You'll get more foot traffic.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.738
- Evan, no.
- There are people
out to get you over there.

23:57.780 --> 24:00.248
- Just because the going gets a
little bit tough doesn't mean we

24:00.300 --> 24:03.121
need to up and quit.
- You're not your father, Miles.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.910
And no one's gonna think lesser
of either of you.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.781
- We need the money.
Let me call Laughlin Brewers,

24:08.830 --> 24:11.913
tell them we'll
take their buyout offer.

24:11.970 --> 24:14.700
- Come on, Miles. We could
all use the money

24:14.750 --> 24:17.480
to get back on our feet.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.531
- Maybe they'll let you
stay where you are

24:19.580 --> 24:22.845
and you won't have to give up
on your expansion plans.

24:32.030 --> 24:35.158
- Why don't you call me

24:37.690 --> 24:39.646
Why don't you call me

24:42.300 --> 24:44.256
- Hey, Jules.
- Hey.

24:44.300 --> 24:47.519
- Um... about that, actually.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.744
I'm sorry, but I didn't
get a chance to make it

24:50.790 --> 24:53.133
to the store for you.
- Oh, no worries.

24:53.180 --> 24:55.489
I can smell like fruit salad
for another day.

24:55.530 --> 24:57.486
Did you buy
any cool travel dresses?

24:57.530 --> 25:00.317
- Actually...

25:00.360 --> 25:02.316
I didn't get anything.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.270
Man, if my dad gave me

25:04.320 --> 25:06.709
a lot of cash, there's no way
I'd be bringing back change.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.716
What is it?

25:11.770 --> 25:14.591
What happened?

25:14.640 --> 25:17.074
- I, um...

25:17.120 --> 25:19.634
bumped into
my ex-boyfriend, Liam.

25:19.690 --> 25:22.511
Right? Ever since then,
I've just felt...

25:22.560 --> 25:25.734
bad... or sad,

25:25.780 --> 25:27.828
or maybe...

25:27.870 --> 25:29.770
empty. I don't know.

25:29.830 --> 25:32.128
- Even though you're broken up.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.398
- I thought I was over it.

25:34.440 --> 25:36.658
Him.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.009
But we weren't supposed
to talk at all before I left.

25:39.050 --> 25:42.008
That was the deal. You know?
A clean break.

25:42.060 --> 25:44.142
- Breakups are never clean.

25:44.190 --> 25:47.273
- So I'm learning.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.367
- Well, do you still
feel like you have stuff

25:51.410 --> 25:53.366
you wanna say to him?

25:53.420 --> 25:55.718
What would I say?

25:55.770 --> 25:58.671
- How about everything
you just told me?

26:04.430 --> 26:07.388
Say hi
to your Uncle Evan, there.

26:07.430 --> 26:09.773
- Hi, Evan! Hi.

26:09.820 --> 26:13.210
Hey, what about you?
- Hey, Dylan.

26:13.260 --> 26:16.047
We just thought we'd stop by
with an update.

26:16.090 --> 26:18.695
- The police
only found ﬁngerprints

26:18.750 --> 26:21.435
from you and your brother,
Whitney, Jerry and Evan.

26:21.490 --> 26:23.390
- So... no leads there.

26:23.450 --> 26:26.578
- Thanks.

26:32.670 --> 26:35.457
- Look at what you're up to.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.060
You're gonna be taller
than your Uncle Evan is.

26:38.110 --> 26:41.500
I know it! I know it! Come here!

26:41.550 --> 26:43.859
Say hi to Uncle Evan!

26:46.300 --> 26:48.939
- Dad left shortly after
this video was taken.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.902
- It's over.

26:56.350 --> 26:59.126
- I just got this this morning.

26:59.180 --> 27:03.002
Laughlin Brewers are rescinding
their offer.
: Why?

27:03.050 --> 27:05.132
- They just got tired
of waiting around for an answer.

27:05.180 --> 27:08.616
They moved on.
- I'm so sorry, Dylan.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.831
- There's no way
to keep Wayward Wally going?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.835
- Well, it's just we
don't have enough money

27:12.890 --> 27:14.846
to pay out our existing
contracts, let alone rebuild.

27:14.890 --> 27:17.108
You know, it's...

27:17.150 --> 27:19.584
- We have to sell the building.

27:19.630 --> 27:21.586
Yeah, it's just
the last asset we have.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.631
We know a couple of agents,

27:23.680 --> 27:26.331
probably get you a good price.
- Thanks, but it's

27:26.380 --> 27:28.029
already in motion. There's
a company that's interested.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.980
- Wow. You move fast.
- Oh, no. They've been after

27:30.030 --> 27:33.591
this building forever.
- Some numbered company.

27:33.650 --> 27:35.686
We get an offer from them
about once a year.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.867
- You don't say.

27:37.910 --> 27:41.607
- When exactly did
this last offer come in?

27:41.660 --> 27:43.525
- Just this morning.

27:45.620 --> 27:48.305
- Yeah. It's perfect timing,
I guess.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.180
- Maybe a little too perfect.

27:55.230 --> 27:57.232
And why a numbered company?
What are they hiding?

27:57.280 --> 27:59.453
- Could be these attacks
weren't about the beer at all.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.718
- Someone's been after
their property but the boys

28:01.760 --> 28:03.808
keep turning down their offer.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.318
- So this company tries
to bankrupt the brewery,

28:06.380 --> 28:08.325
then pretend to ride in
on a white horse

28:08.380 --> 28:10.200
to secure the sale.
- Hold on.

28:10.250 --> 28:13.151
Hey Zoe. Any luck?

28:13.210 --> 28:15.166
- [I talked
to the real estate agent.]

28:17.040 --> 28:19.645
- [Oh, well. It's
probably a shell anyway.]

28:19.690 --> 28:22.568
- He did _have an address.
Texting you now.

28:30.790 --> 28:33.179
- Hello. We'd like to speak
to the person

28:33.230 --> 28:35.186
in charge of the Wayward Wally's
Brewery purchase.

28:35.230 --> 28:38.142
- That's the Westfield CFO.
I'll let him know

28:38.190 --> 28:40.010
you're here if you'll
just have a seat.

28:40.060 --> 28:43.143
- Thanks. Now it all
makes sense.

28:43.190 --> 28:46.102
When will this city's appetite
for flipping finally die?

28:46.150 --> 28:48.801
- Not until they've torn down
the last real neighbourhood

28:48.850 --> 28:51.410
that has any soul left at all.
- That strip where Wally's is,

28:51.460 --> 28:54.338
I wouldn't be surprised
if Westfield's trying to buy up

28:54.380 --> 28:56.371
the entire block.
- Yeah. I'd like to give

28:56.430 --> 28:58.330
this monster a piece of my mind.

29:10.830 --> 29:14.049
- When my brother Wallace left,
the boys were really young

29:14.100 --> 29:16.227
and their mother,
she was in no condition

29:16.270 --> 29:18.659
to keep the business afloat.
- So you offered to buy her out.

29:18.710 --> 29:21.759
- Yeah. And she refused.
God bless her.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.143
And I can't say I blame her.
A lot of good memories

29:24.190 --> 29:26.920
in that place. But Jerry decided
to open his own shop in there,

29:26.980 --> 29:29.278
so that kept some rent money
coming in the door.

29:29.330 --> 29:31.491
- So how do the boys
figure into this?

29:31.550 --> 29:33.415
- Well, about five years ago,
the boys said

29:33.460 --> 29:36.247
they wanted to open a brewery
in their father's honour.

29:36.290 --> 29:39.418
I thought it was sweet,
if a little ill-conceived.

29:39.470 --> 29:41.426
- But you let 'em go for it.
- Well, it's their building.

29:41.470 --> 29:43.290
I can't exactly stop them.

29:43.340 --> 29:46.776
- So why offer to buy it now and
why be so secretive about it?

29:46.820 --> 29:49.948
- Because the boys are proud.
And they're stubborn.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.868
They're just like their father
and just like their uncle.
They hate charity.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.876
As for the timing, I mean,
it's kind of appropriate,

29:55.920 --> 29:57.694
don't you think?

29:57.750 --> 29:59.786
- Maybe a little
too appropriate.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.920
- Do you think I have something
to do with the sabotage?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.018
- Maybe with Jerry retiring,

30:07.060 --> 30:09.528
you thought it was the right
time to squeeze the boys out.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.535
- That's ridiculous.
The place has sat empty

30:11.590 --> 30:13.626
for years. Why would I
want to redevelop it now?

30:13.680 --> 30:15.454
- You didn't.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.639
Boys said they
get an offer every year.

30:17.680 --> 30:21.070
- OK. I can see how this looks

30:21.120 --> 30:23.202
from the outside,
but those boys,

30:23.250 --> 30:25.980
they're like sons to me.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.338
I make that offer every year
as a sort of check-up,

30:28.390 --> 30:30.164
and I'm actually secretly proud

30:30.210 --> 30:32.087
that they keep turning me down.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.085
If you'll excuse me, I actually
do have a conference call.

30:37.130 --> 30:39.872
- Yeah.

30:41.880 --> 30:43.745
- Why do I feel like there's
more to his story?

30:43.790 --> 30:46.224
- It's the old too-good
-to-be-true caution flag.

30:46.270 --> 30:49.148
And the annual check-up thing,
does that even make sense?

30:49.190 --> 30:50.919
- So what do you
think he's hiding?

30:50.970 --> 30:52.926
- I don't know,
but I bet there's

30:52.980 --> 30:55.540
a certain mechanic who might.

30:57.890 --> 31:00.154
- Well, Jerry, looks like
you'll be taking that trip

31:00.200 --> 31:02.634
down to Florida a little bit
sooner than you expected.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.467
- Yeah. Dylan told me that
they've given up the brewery

31:05.510 --> 31:07.330
and they're selling
the building. A damn shame.

31:07.380 --> 31:09.689
- Did they mention
who they were selling it to?

31:09.730 --> 31:12.517
- No.
- Evan.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.688
- Well, at least they know
they'll get a fair price.

31:15.740 --> 31:18.208
He's a good man.
- You have known him

31:18.260 --> 31:21.047
for a long time.
- Yeah. Wallace brought Evan in

31:21.090 --> 31:23.046
as an apprentice.
He was determined to turn

31:23.090 --> 31:25.558
his little brother
into a world-class mechanic.

31:25.620 --> 31:27.918
But Evan was more
about the numbers.

31:27.970 --> 31:31.007
- Well, it worked out that way

31:31.060 --> 31:32.834
once it was clear
he was no grease monkey.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.969
- No, it worked out
for the best.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.978
Once Wallace left,
Evan put up this wall,

31:40.020 --> 31:43.501
split the joint in two, allowed
me to stay on. He's done
a lot for those boys.

31:43.550 --> 31:46.769
More than he'll let on.
Mind you,

31:46.810 --> 31:49.244
part of it could be the guilt.

31:49.290 --> 31:52.032
- Oh, he and Wallace
used to fight a lot.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.776
- Oh, money mostly.

31:54.820 --> 31:58.551
You know, despite the fact that
we were doing well, we always
seemed to be struggling, so...

31:58.610 --> 32:00.828
The last time
we all saw Wallace,

32:00.870 --> 32:03.430
Evan had it out with him
and they had a real knock-down,

32:03.480 --> 32:06.131
drag-'em-out battle.
I stayed out of it.

32:06.180 --> 32:08.307
- And do you think
that's why Wallace left?

32:08.360 --> 32:11.966
- Evan clearly thought so,
'cause from that point forward,

32:12.010 --> 32:14.274
he was committed to keeping
that family whole.

32:19.850 --> 32:22.239
- I see the steam coming out
of your ears. What have you got?

32:22.280 --> 32:24.419
- Something about that story
Jerry told us.

32:24.460 --> 32:26.234
- Yeah, it struck me too.

32:26.290 --> 32:28.986
Evan never mentioned handling
the finances of Wallace's shop.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.986
- A lot of business coming in,
not a lot of money

32:31.030 --> 32:32.895
to show for it.
- And then an argument

32:32.950 --> 32:34.679
about money the day
Wallace disappeared?

32:34.730 --> 32:36.641
- What does a 20-year-old
argument have to do

32:36.690 --> 32:39.420
with the brewery
or Miles or Dylan?

32:39.470 --> 32:41.688
- I guess it's time
we brew up a new theory.

32:44.040 --> 32:47.168
OK. So 20 years ago,

32:47.220 --> 32:50.269
Dylan and Miles' father walks
off after a fight with Evan.

32:50.310 --> 32:52.744
- Evan spends
the next two decades

32:52.790 --> 32:54.576
secretly helping his nephews:

32:54.620 --> 32:56.520
managing the shop,
sending them to college.

32:56.580 --> 32:58.707
- Even helping them start
the brewery five years ago.

32:58.750 --> 33:00.706
- Exactly. He's an investor.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.103
How does it help him
to destroy the brewery?

33:03.150 --> 33:05.141
- What, at the height

33:05.200 --> 33:07.361
of the market? It'd be
the worst business decision

33:07.420 --> 33:09.456
the guy ever made.

33:09.500 --> 33:12.981
What's changed?

33:15.950 --> 33:18.726
- Or something
about the building itself?

33:18.770 --> 33:20.818
It's gotta be
the brewery expansion.

33:27.170 --> 33:29.695
- I don't know, just...
something different.

33:29.740 --> 33:32.004
- Well, they're goin' big:

33:32.050 --> 33:34.484
shop, caf.
- Lots of natural light,

33:34.530 --> 33:37.875
real open concept.
- That's it.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.528
- What's missing
from this picture?

33:42.580 --> 33:47.017
- The wall that separates
Wally's from Jerry's.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.016
It's being knocked down
as part of the expansion.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.015
- And when did Jerry
say it went up?

33:51.070 --> 33:53.061
- Right after Wallace left.

33:53.110 --> 33:55.112
He built it to separate
the building into two.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.242
- Well, why would anyone
care about a wall?

33:57.290 --> 33:59.599
Why go to all that trouble
to prevent it

33:59.640 --> 34:02.200
from being torn down?
- I can think of one reason.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.206
- Yeah. And if you're right,
we're not looking

34:04.250 --> 34:06.866
for a _saboteur. _
We're looking for a killer.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.347
- Hi.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.096
- Growing impatient.

34:19.140 --> 34:21.096
- I think that's a good sign.

34:21.140 --> 34:24.359
- Come on in, guys. Miles,
can I get you anything else?

34:24.410 --> 34:27.402
- Oh, baby.

34:27.450 --> 34:30.886
I would if I could. I never
wanted it to end like that.
- I know.

34:30.930 --> 34:32.886
- Don't tire him out.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.840
- OK.
- We won't.

34:37.550 --> 34:39.506
- Things seem to be
getting back to normal.

34:39.550 --> 34:41.506
- Yeah, gettin' there.

34:41.550 --> 34:44.201
Who would've thought all it took
to knock some sense into me

34:44.250 --> 34:46.206
was a third degree concussion?

34:46.250 --> 34:49.378
- Actually, there's something
we wanted to follow up on.

34:49.430 --> 34:51.512
- Do you have any paperwork

34:51.560 --> 34:54.028
from the shop from before
your dad disappeared?

34:54.090 --> 34:57.526
- Like account ledgers,
blueprints, bills.

34:57.570 --> 34:59.344
- Yeah, my father was
a real pack rat. It's a trait

34:59.400 --> 35:02.130
that I unfortunately
inherited from him.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.171
What's this for?
- It's just a theory

35:04.230 --> 35:06.528
we're working on.
- Guys...

35:06.580 --> 35:08.969
Look, I'm sorry, but...

35:09.010 --> 35:11.831
it's over. Whoever did this,

35:11.890 --> 35:13.881
they won.
- That's funny.

35:13.930 --> 35:15.921
I never pegged you
for a quitter.

35:15.980 --> 35:18.448
- Nice try.

35:18.500 --> 35:20.843
- But even I
have to face the facts

35:20.900 --> 35:23.937
every once in a while.
It was a nice dream.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.935
- I'll tell you what, Miles. How
about you leave the facts to us

35:25.990 --> 35:29.630
and don't give up
on that dream just yet.

35:31.690 --> 35:34.909
You're sure this
is not a load

35:34.950 --> 35:37.953
- Sure I'm sure.
- And you got

35:38.000 --> 35:39.774
your contractor's license from?

35:39.830 --> 35:42.048
- Hours of watching
the Property Brothers.

35:42.090 --> 35:43.955
- OK.

35:44.010 --> 35:46.308
Well...

35:46.360 --> 35:48.521
here goes nothin'.

36:16.690 --> 36:18.646
- What the hell
do you guys think you're doing?

36:18.690 --> 36:22.080
- Uncovering
a 20-year-old murder.

36:22.130 --> 36:23.995
Your message said there
was a breakthrough in the case?

36:24.050 --> 36:26.086
- Oh, we did have
a breakthrough.

36:26.140 --> 36:29.439
Unfortunately for you, forensic
science has come a long way

36:29.490 --> 36:32.266
since the '90s.
- It's not gonna be too hard

36:32.320 --> 36:34.481
to figure out who put Wallace
in the wall there.

36:38.970 --> 36:40.926
- You don't understand.

36:40.980 --> 36:43.232
- Oh, no, no. We do understand.
Most of it, anyway.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.236
Back in the day,

36:45.290 --> 36:47.497
you, Wallace, Jerry,
you all worked together

36:47.550 --> 36:49.802
right here, in this building.

36:49.850 --> 36:51.989
- The boys said he trusted you.
He must have been

36:52.030 --> 36:55.682
really upset when he caught you
skimming the books.

36:55.730 --> 36:58.164
You killed your own brother
to make a quick buck.

36:58.210 --> 37:00.815
- No, it was an accident. We
were arguing, sure. And he

37:00.870 --> 37:03.338
shoved me and I
shoved him back and...

37:03.390 --> 37:05.381
he fell over on the...

37:05.440 --> 37:08.079
lift and it...

37:08.130 --> 37:11.566
...broke his neck.

37:13.920 --> 37:15.968
- Because there
was money missmg

37:16.010 --> 37:17.921
and people knew
we were fighting and...

37:17.970 --> 37:19.926
no one was gonna believe me.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.321
I never meant to kill him.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.713
- Was it you who attacked Miles
last night in the brewery?

37:28.760 --> 37:32.287
- I was just trying to destroy
the tank. He came out
of nowhere!

37:32.330 --> 37:35.549
- Yeah. Save it for the police.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.036
- They will shortly.

37:46.650 --> 37:49.437
- This is what I
dreaded the most.

37:49.480 --> 37:52.608
I spent my whole life
taking care of these kids.

37:52.660 --> 37:55.743
- Guilt can_ be
a strong motivator.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.007
- I've given
those boys everything.

38:03.010 --> 38:05.490
- Everything except the truth.

38:19.550 --> 38:23.850
- And carry on

38:25.990 --> 38:28.072
But don't say a word

38:34.350 --> 38:36.739
- Hey.

38:36.790 --> 38:38.746
How you guys holding up?

38:38.790 --> 38:40.610
- I can't believe

38:40.660 --> 38:43.185
Dad never left us.
- Yeah. How'd you guys find out

38:43.230 --> 38:45.130
about the embezzlement?

38:45.190 --> 38:47.351
- Well, we searched through
some of those old ledgers

38:47.410 --> 38:49.366
you gave us.
- Shortly before your dad

38:49.410 --> 38:51.719
disappeared, there was a slight
variation in his signature

38:51.760 --> 38:54.069
on the company cheques.

38:54.110 --> 38:56.237
- You know, I spent my whole
life hating the wrong person.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.807
- The insurance money

39:02.860 --> 39:04.373
should come in
in a couple of days.

39:04.420 --> 39:06.809
- And you could use it

39:06.860 --> 39:08.725
to pay off your debts

39:08.780 --> 39:10.862
or start over new someplace,
if you want.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.039
- I think we should stay here.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.918
All this... it's gotta
be for something.

39:28.710 --> 39:32.146
: Thanks for coming.

39:32.190 --> 39:34.317
- Sure.

39:34.370 --> 39:36.930
Um... how was the rest
of your day with Carly?

39:36.980 --> 39:39.710
- Short. We went home

39:39.760 --> 39:41.546
right after we ran into you.

39:41.590 --> 39:43.979
- Right. Sorry if I...

39:44.030 --> 39:46.726
ruined your shopping trip.
- No, no.

39:46.770 --> 39:48.726
I guess I'll just
go shopping in Italy.

39:50.730 --> 39:53.995
- So... some coincidence,
bumping into you.

39:57.650 --> 40:01.120
No! Wh
- No! y

40:01.180 --> 40:03.785
No. Um... just the opposite.

40:03.830 --> 40:07.357
- Me too. I think.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.870
But, um, what do you mean?

40:10.930 --> 40:14.058
- I thought I was good.

40:14.100 --> 40:17.103
You know, with us
not being us...

40:19.060 --> 40:20.971
...but I'm not.

40:21.020 --> 40:22.885
- Me neither.

40:22.940 --> 40:25.761
- I mean, as soon
as I heard your voice...

40:28.250 --> 40:30.241
- Cool.

40:30.290 --> 40:33.555
- But I'm still going to Italy.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.943
Nothing's changed.

40:35.990 --> 40:38.458
- Maybe we could
just... talk sometimes?

40:38.520 --> 40:40.681
Just as friends?

40:40.740 --> 40:44.301
- I don't... think I
can just be friends with you.

40:47.090 --> 40:49.524
- I don't think I can be
just friends with you either.

40:49.570 --> 40:51.526
- So...

40:51.570 --> 40:53.618
where does that leave us?

40:55.620 --> 40:58.919
- Hey there, love

40:58.970 --> 41:01.495
Tell me, are you

41:01.540 --> 41:04.270
A dreamer like me?

41:06.550 --> 41:10.099
Even after sleep

41:10.160 --> 41:12.025
You believe in your soul

41:12.070 --> 41:14.595
In love, no one's alone

41:18.470 --> 41:20.688
- Hey, babe.

41:20.730 --> 41:22.516
- So...

41:22.560 --> 41:24.824
I have something to show you.

41:29.830 --> 41:32.173
- Oh, my God.

41:32.220 --> 41:34.302
Babe, it's perfect.

41:34.360 --> 41:37.045
- Yeah.

41:41.450 --> 41:43.406
You know what?

41:43.450 --> 41:46.101
I think Dad would like it too.
- Yeah.

41:46.150 --> 41:48.846
- Ooh

41:48.890 --> 41:51.541
- Recycling day!

41:53.850 --> 41:55.761
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hold on! I got it!

41:55.810 --> 41:59.462
- No, no! I can--
- No, no, no. I got it.
It's the least I can do.

41:59.510 --> 42:02.422
Thanks for talking to Jules.
- Oh, that.

42:02.470 --> 42:04.335
It's no problem.
She's a good kid.

42:04.390 --> 42:07.348
Plus, girl stuff

42:07.390 --> 42:09.255
can be hard sometimes.
- Tell me about it.

42:09.300 --> 42:11.348
Wait. Don't tell me about it.

42:11.390 --> 42:13.858
I'm just happy she's happy.

42:14.830 --> 42:17.139
What are you doing here?
Get out of here!

42:17.180 --> 42:19.307
Go enjoy your weekend.
- Copy that, boss.

42:22.270 --> 42:25.319
- Hey there, darling

42:25.360 --> 42:29.581
Well, everybody,
they can play for life

42:32.070 --> 42:35.494
We can live like we're alive

42:35.550 --> 42:38.326
And running free

42:38.380 --> 42:39.802
You know, true love
follows dreams

42:42.640 --> 42:45.768
- Hey.
- Look what I have here:

42:45.820 --> 42:49.517
the last case
of the original brew.

42:49.560 --> 42:51.994
- Well, let's just say

42:52.040 --> 42:55.168
the brewery has
a new celebrity endorsement.

42:55.220 --> 42:58.087
- Oh, Shade. Thanks.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.131
Those guys really
deserve a break.

43:00.180 --> 43:03.707
- Yeah.
- So this is a bona fide

43:03.750 --> 43:06.389
collector's item, huh?
- For special occasions only.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.238
- Ooh

43:15.460 --> 43:17.416
- To a job well done, partner.

43:17.460 --> 43:19.325
- I'll drink to that.

43:21.640 --> 43:28.637
- Ooh

43:28.690 --> 43:32.649
Hey there, love

43:32.690 --> 43:36.126
Tell me, are you
a dreamer like me?

43:39.130 --> 43:40.995
Even after sleep

43:41.050 --> 43:43.689
You believe in your soul

43:43.750 --> 43:46.571
In love, we're not alone

43:49.450 --> 43:54.570
Ooh

43:54.630 --> 43:57.588
Let me

43:57.630 --> 44:00.713
Be the one, oh
