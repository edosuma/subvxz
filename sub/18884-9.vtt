their dreams.

of a Lady Foot Locker by now.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.137
Mm.

17:13.103 --> 17:14.758
Just look around the room.

17:14.758 --> 17:18.517
Would you hire one person
from this room to work for you?

17:18.517 --> 17:21.103
- Well, I would absolutely hire
one person from this room.

17:21.103 --> 17:23.103

It'’s me, isn'’t it?

- You would hire Alice over me?

17:30.689 --> 17:31.655
This is bullshit.

you would really hire me?

17:36.758 --> 17:38.344
- Absolutely.
- Wow!

17:38.344 --> 17:40.103

something special about you

17:40.103 --> 17:42.241
the moment that I came
leaping through that door.

17:42.241 --> 17:44.068

to work for you.

17:47.448 --> 17:49.034

Let'’s go to your office
and work out the details.

17:50.724 --> 17:52.724

- Yes, absolutely.

17:52.724 --> 17:55.862

17:57.103 --> 17:58.551
Okay, great. Wow.

our jobs?

18:00.896 --> 18:02.655
Adam, say something
that motivates us.

18:02.655 --> 18:04.482
- I'’m done motivating,
okay, Bill?

18:04.482 --> 18:07.103

18:07.103 --> 18:10.241

I wouldn'’t even--

18:10.241 --> 18:11.827

18:11.827 --> 18:14.655
- Thank you for seeing
something special in me.

18:14.655 --> 18:16.137
To be perfectly honest,

18:16.137 --> 18:18.482
I don'’t really see it
in myself all the time,

18:18.482 --> 18:21.275
but you saw it,
and you'’re a genius,

18:21.275 --> 18:22.689
so it must be real.

18:22.689 --> 18:24.448
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

18:24.448 --> 18:26.655
- You'’re good at sales,
and I'’m a saleswoman.

18:26.655 --> 18:29.620
- No, you are so much more
than a saleswoman.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.620
You--you see
into people'’s souls.

18:32.620 --> 18:34.172
- Yeah.

18:34.172 --> 18:36.068
You think that because
I made you think that.

18:36.068 --> 18:38.758
All that profanity
and the face holding

18:38.758 --> 18:41.344
and chanting, I mean, those
are just devices that I use

18:41.344 --> 18:44.137
to manufacture emotion.

18:44.137 --> 18:45.862
- No, but y-you said
in your book

18:45.862 --> 18:49.620
that authenticity is the main
ingredient to dreams.

18:49.620 --> 18:52.241
- I stole that from a teenager'’s
Instagram account.

18:52.241 --> 18:56.000
- No, but what about being
the author of your life?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.172
- Well, I'’m the author
of a book

18:58.172 --> 19:00.586

and very powerful.

19:00.586 --> 19:03.241
