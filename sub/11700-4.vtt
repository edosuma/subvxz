WEBVTT

00:02.135 --> 00:03.637
OKAY, I KNOW YOU'VE ONLY
BEEN GONE A COUPLE OF DAYS,

00:03.637 --> 00:04.972
BUT LOOK WHAT YOU MISSED.

00:04.972 --> 00:07.374
EMMA,
STICK OUT YOUR TONGUE.

00:07.374 --> 00:09.076
(laughs) YEAH.

00:09.076 --> 00:10.444
EMMA, BLOW A KISS.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.149
-AMAZING, RIGHT?
-(laughs) That's great!

00:16.149 --> 00:17.351
All Mom taught us
how to do

00:17.351 --> 00:18.986
was the field sobriety test.

00:20.153 --> 00:22.656
I'M TELLING YOU,
I THINK SHE MIGHT BE A GENIUS.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.558
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THE WORLD?

00:24.558 --> 00:27.394
BEN POSTED EMMA DOING
THAT STUPID TONGUE TRICK,

00:27.394 --> 00:30.030
AND IT ALREADY HAS
OVER 200 LIKES.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.466
I CHANGE MY STATUS
TO "IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH BEN WHEELER,"

00:32.466 --> 00:33.667
AND I ONLY GOT ONE.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.504
AND GRANDPA PERRIN
LIKES EVERYTHING.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.975
RILEY, YOU'RE THE GIRL
WHO CRIED "BEN."

00:41.975 --> 00:43.710
I MEAN,
YOU'VE POSTED THAT
SO MANY TIMES,

00:43.710 --> 00:45.646
NO ONE BELIEVES YOU.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.447
I KNOW I DON'T.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.518
OH MY GOD.

00:51.518 --> 00:53.020
I'M MINDY.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.022
OOH, AND I'M DARNELL.
I LOVE ROLE-PLAY.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.526
NO! MINDY IS A GIRL
FROM MY OFFICE

00:59.526 --> 01:02.362
WHO FINALLY LANDED
THE GUY SHE'S BEEN
CHASING HER WHOLE LIFE,

01:02.362 --> 01:05.165
AND THEN ALL
OF THESE HORRIBLE WOMEN
RAN THIS SECRET POOL

01:05.165 --> 01:06.767
BETTING ON HOW SOON
THEY'D BREAK UP.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.602
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.636
HOW MUCH DID YOU WIN?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.172
ALMOST $100.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.674
-(chuckles)
-(door opens)

01:13.674 --> 01:14.708
Bonnie:
ALL RIGHT!

01:18.111 --> 01:20.581
WHICH ONE OF YOU
SHINY-HAIRED DEGENERATES

01:20.581 --> 01:22.015
STOLE MY CONDITIONER?

01:23.350 --> 01:25.552
SAYS THE WOMAN
IN MY BATHROOM

01:25.552 --> 01:27.554
STANDING UNDER MY WATER

01:27.554 --> 01:29.189
USING MY TOWELS.

01:29.189 --> 01:31.091
DID I USE
THE WORD "MY" ENOUGH?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.527
'CAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GETTING IT.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.663
OH, I GET IT, YOU KNOW,
BUT YOU'RE JUST NOT
GETTING RID OF ME.

01:36.663 --> 01:40.133
I BOUGHT PLENTY MORE HAIR
WHERE THIS CAME FROM.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.002
Danny:
Hey, Mom, looking good.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.738
OOH. HEY,
IS THAT YOUR BROTHER?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.974
I WONDER IF HE HAS
AN OPINION ON THIS.

01:46.974 --> 01:51.311
NO. NO, THERE IS ONLY
ONE BROTHER WHOSE PERMISSION
YOU NEED TO LIVE HERE.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.713
THIS ONE.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.181
-DANNY? DANNY, DANNY.
-GIVE IT TO ME. NO.

01:54.181 --> 01:58.352
TELL TUCKER THAT
THE WOMAN WHO CARRIED
ALL 14 LBS. OF YOU

01:58.352 --> 02:00.187
INSIDE OF HER BODY

02:00.187 --> 02:02.990
FOR 11 MONTHS
CAN STAY IN YOUR ROOM!

02:02.990 --> 02:04.057
HEY! NO! GIVE IT.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.227
YOU TWO MIGHT SHARE D.N.A.,
BUT I SHARE A WALL WITH YOU.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.396
IF SHE DOESN'T GET OUT,
YOUR SECRETS WILL.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.398
(chuckles) OKAY.

02:11.398 --> 02:13.200
SO, YOU HOMESICK YET?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.969
W-why would I be homesick
when Paris is my new home?

02:15.969 --> 02:16.970
I gotta go.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.143
I THINK
THAT WENT PRETTY WELL.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.145
TOTALLY.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.381
EXCEPT FOR THE PART
WHERE YOU FORGOT TO MENTION

02:27.381 --> 02:29.082
THAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND
DUMPED YOU

02:29.082 --> 02:30.751
BEFORE YOU EVEN
HIT THE GROUND IN PARIS,

02:30.751 --> 02:32.719
AND THAT YOU'RE
ACTUALLY IN NEW YORK,

02:32.719 --> 02:35.255
SECRETLY CRASHING
WITH YOUR MOM'S EX-BOYFRIEND.

02:35.255 --> 02:38.225
(theme music plays)

02:38.225 --> 02:41.495
<i>♪ IT'S AMAZING</i>
<i>HOW THE UNEXPECTED ♪</i>

02:41.495 --> 02:44.765
<i>♪ CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE</i>
<i>AND CHANGE DIRECTION ♪</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:51.605
OKAY. LAST QUESTION.

02:51.605 --> 02:54.007
"WHAT IS YOUR
IDEA OF THE
PERFECT DATE?"

02:54.007 --> 02:55.742
IS IT, "A," A WALK ON THE BEACH,

02:55.742 --> 02:57.377
"B," DINNER AND A MOVIE,

02:57.377 --> 02:59.346
OR, "C," A QUIET NIGHT AT HOME?

03:01.014 --> 03:03.050
WHICH ONE ENDS WITH SEX?

03:04.184 --> 03:08.088
AND IT'S "D," NONE OF THE ABOVE.

03:08.088 --> 03:11.191
WHICH BRINGS OUR COMPATIBILITY
SCORE TO A 10...

03:11.191 --> 03:13.160
THERE YOU GO! PERFECT SCORE.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.128
I TOLD YOU WE WERE MEANT
TO BE TOGETHER.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.463
...OUT OF A HUNDRED.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.199
WE FAILED.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.201
RILEY, PLEASE DON'T
GO THERE AGAIN.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.104
OKAY, FIRST,
WE ARE SHUNNED
BY SOCIAL MEDIA...

03:24.104 --> 03:25.739
-YOU'RE GOING THERE.
-...THEN WE FAILED

03:25.739 --> 03:28.375
SEVEN DIFFERENT QUIZZES
WRITTEN BY EXPERTS.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.343
-YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.
-AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF,

03:30.343 --> 03:31.611
I THINK THE HORRIBLE WOMEN
AT WORK

03:31.611 --> 03:33.280
ARE RUNNING A POOL ON ME.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.650
AND YOU'RE THERE. RILEY...

03:36.650 --> 03:37.684
COME ON, PLEASE.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.019
WHO CARES WHAT EVERYONE ELSE
THINKS?

03:39.019 --> 03:40.487
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT WE'RE
TOGETHER.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.055
NO, WHAT MATTERS IS THAT

03:42.055 --> 03:43.590
EVERYONE IS JEALOUS
THAT WE'RE TOGETHER.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.425
OKAY, MOM, MOM.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.027
MY MOM AGREES WITH ME,
DON'T YOU?

03:47.027 --> 03:48.995
YES, IN MY EXPERIENCE,

03:48.995 --> 03:50.163
ONE KID IS ENOUGH.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.500
NO. NO, RILEY IS CONCERNED

03:53.500 --> 03:55.168
THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE
ENTIRELY COMPATIBLE.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.070
WELL, IT'S JUST SHE SPENT

03:57.070 --> 03:58.105
SO MANY YEARS BUILDING UP

03:58.105 --> 03:58.972
THIS RELATIONSHIP IN HER HEAD

03:58.972 --> 04:00.340
THAT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

04:00.340 --> 04:02.075
IT COULD EVER LIVE UP TO HER
EXPECTATIONS,

04:02.075 --> 04:04.044
SO THERE'S REALLY
NOWHERE ELSE TO GO
BUT DOWN.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.614
MOM!

04:08.982 --> 04:10.417
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

04:10.417 --> 04:14.154
SORRY. IT WAS A LITTLE UNCLEAR
WHICH WAY YOU WANTED ME TO GO.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.090
(sighs)
WE'RE DOOMED.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.159
IT'S OVER. I MEAN,
SHOULD WE JUST END IT NOW?

04:19.159 --> 04:20.694
-NO, IT'S NOT. IT'S FINE.
-WHAT WERE WE EVEN THINKING?

04:20.694 --> 04:23.063
-RELAX. CHILL.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS--
-NOBODY THINKS THAT WE CAN--

04:33.974 --> 04:36.143
-DOES THIS REALLY WORK?
-(chuckles)

04:36.143 --> 04:38.545
I MEAN, HELLO.

04:39.746 --> 04:42.015
I HAVE THE PORES OF A BABY.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.618
A BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL BABY.

04:46.153 --> 04:48.054
BUT, DANNY,
WE NEED TO TALK.

04:48.054 --> 04:51.424
OKAY, BUT CAN WE WAIT
UNTIL WE TAKE THE MASKS OFF?

04:51.424 --> 04:53.126
BECAUSE YOU'RE
KIND OF FREAKING ME OUT.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.596
I HAVE A NEW GIRLFRIEND,

04:56.596 --> 04:59.766
AND I'M NOT REALLY SET UP
FOR THE WHOLE "ROOMMATE" THING.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.201
DON'T WORRY. I GET IT.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.069
HONESTLY,
I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

05:04.070 --> 05:05.605
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE, DANNY.

05:05.605 --> 05:09.042
OKAY. I'LL JUST CALL
ONE OF MY TEAMMATES...

05:09.042 --> 05:11.111
WHOSE NUMBERS
ARE IN MY LAPTOP.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.579
OKAY, NOW WE'RE
GETTING SOMEWHERE.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.482
WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE,

05:15.482 --> 05:17.017
BECAUSE I LEFT IT
AT MY PLACE.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.219
BUT IT'S COOL.
YOU COULD JUST
SNEAK IN AND GET IT.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.054
THANKS IN ADVANCE, BRO.

05:22.455 --> 05:24.591
I CAN'T GO THERE.
WHAT IF I SEE YOUR MOM?

05:24.591 --> 05:27.060
BAD THINGS HAPPEN
WHEN I SEE YOUR MOM.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.030
ALSO VERY GOOD THINGS,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

05:30.030 --> 05:33.099
I DO, BUT I'M GOING
TO PRETEND LIKE I DON'T.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.002
-UH-OH.
-WHAT'S WRONG?

05:36.002 --> 05:38.471
IS IT NORMAL
TO BE COMPLETELY NUMB
FROM THE NECK UP?

05:38.471 --> 05:40.207
YES, THAT MEANS
YOU'RE ALMOST DONE.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.108
NOW WE'RE
ONTO THE TEETH WHITENING.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.243
MAN, I LOVE A PROJECT!

05:47.480 --> 05:50.050
I'M TELLING YOU,
NOW THAT WE'RE
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

05:50.050 --> 05:51.351
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.019
(scoffs)

05:53.019 --> 05:55.322
AND WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME?

05:56.556 --> 05:58.058
I SHOULD PROBABLY ASK SOMEONE

05:58.058 --> 05:59.125
I HAVEN'T ALREADY DATED.
I'M SORRY.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.130
UH-OH.
CRAZY IN THE COURTYARD.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.266
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:06.266 --> 06:07.467
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.735
NO SHIRT, NO SHOES,
NO PSYCHIC.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.070
(Jersey accent)
OH, COME ON.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.305
IT'S JUST
A LITTLE CARD READING.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.208
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW
THEIR FUTURE, HUH?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.077
IF YOU COULD
ACTUALLY SEE THE FUTURE,

06:17.077 --> 06:19.079
YOU'D SEE ME
THROWING YOU OUT OF HERE.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.981
OH, WHAT'S THE HARM?

06:20.981 --> 06:23.016
I TELL A FEW GIRLS
THEIR LIVES ARE PERFECT,

06:23.016 --> 06:24.551
THEY'LL EVENTUALLY
MEET THE ONE,

06:24.551 --> 06:27.087
NO ONE GETS HURT,
AND I CAN AFFORD TO GET

06:27.087 --> 06:28.054
A DIVORCE FROM MY HUSBAND

06:28.054 --> 06:30.090
BEFORE HE CHEATS
ON ME NEXT SUMMER.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.094
AS ALWAYS, IT'S A PLEASURE
SAYING GOODBYE, MOM.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.595
GOODBYE, MOM.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.197
YOU KNOW,
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

06:37.197 --> 06:39.633
I THINK YOU AND I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.034
-HI.
-HI.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.470
SO I TOLD MY MOM
THAT YOU AND I WERE
BACK TOGETHER,

06:43.470 --> 06:46.373
AND SHE ASKED ME
IF I EVER THOUGHT ABOUT
GETTING MY TUBES TIED.

06:46.373 --> 06:49.409
FORGET YOUR MOM.
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK
TO AN EXPERT.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.544
OH, LOOK!
HERE'S ONE NOW.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.413
HI. HI, I'M BEN.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.049
THIS IS MY GIRLFRIEND,
RILEY, WHO'S DOUBTING
OUR FUTURE TOGETHER.

06:56.049 --> 07:00.153
BEN, I'M NOT LISTENING
TO SOME CRAZY FORTUNE TELLER

07:00.153 --> 07:02.022
WHO MAKES HER LIVING PREYING
ON GULLIBLE WOMEN.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.057
-OKAY?
-SUIT YOURSELF.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.260
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU TWO MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.361
REALLY?

07:08.361 --> 07:11.064
WELL, WELL, WHAT ELSE
DO THE CARDS SAY?

07:11.064 --> 07:13.066
BEN, SIT DOWN.
IT'S IMPORTANT.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.736
LOVE...

07:16.736 --> 07:19.005
SUCCESS...

07:19.005 --> 07:21.675
-FAMILY.
-OKAY, LET'S REEL IT IN.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.743
I ALREADY HAVE
ONE KID, ALL RIGHT?

07:23.743 --> 07:26.680
-OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.
-IS IT BAD?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.114
THAT'S USUALLY
WHAT "NOT GOOD" MEANS.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.351
I SEE A BIG BLOWUP

07:31.351 --> 07:33.653
AND A GIANT BREAK
IN YOUR FUTURE.

07:33.653 --> 07:37.057
YOU GOT ALL THAT
FROM A TURKEY HOLDING UP
A BEACH BALL?

07:38.091 --> 07:39.559
I'M SORRY.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.027
THE CARDS DON'T LIE.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.696
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.998
(Jersey accent)
THE CARDS DON'T LIE.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.034
RILEY, SHE CAN'T PREDICT
THE FUTURE

07:48.034 --> 07:49.235
ANY MORE THAN I CAN.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.503
OH REALLY?

07:50.503 --> 07:52.005
WELL, HERE'S
A LITTLE PREDICTION.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.374
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR PIPES.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.742
MY PIPES?

07:55.742 --> 07:58.244
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
MY PIPES ARE DOING JUST FINE.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.047
BEN! THE BATHROOM PIPES
JUST EXPLODED.

08:01.047 --> 08:03.483
THERE'S WATER
GUSHING EVERYWHERE.
(whimpers)

08:05.085 --> 08:07.253
OH MY GOD.
WE'RE DOOMED.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.423
OH, DON'T WORRY.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.193

HE'S ALREADY ON HIS WAY.

<i>IT'S THE AMERICAN... ♪</i>

09:11.484 --> 09:14.220
-BRAD?
-HEY, BON BON.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.422
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.090
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:17.090 --> 09:18.525
YEAH, I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA ASK ME THAT.

09:18.525 --> 09:21.628
SO, YOU FINALLY REALIZED THAT
YOU'RE NOTHING WITHOUT ME,

09:21.628 --> 09:24.030
SO YOU'VE COME TO BEG ME
TO TAKE YOU BACK?

09:24.030 --> 09:25.565
SURE, LET'S GO WITH THAT.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.468
YEAH, WELL,
I'M NOT SOME TWO-BIT TRAMP

09:28.468 --> 09:31.004
THAT'S JUST WAITING TO JUMP
RIGHT BACK IN THE SACK.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.639
YOU HAVE TO CALL FIRST.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.475
I'LL REMEMBER THAT
FOR NEXT TIME.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.743
"NEXT TIME"?

09:36.743 --> 09:39.312
YOU STILL OWE ME AN APOLOGY
FROM LAST TIME.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.248
REMEMBER?
WHEN I THREW MYSELF AT YOU

09:42.248 --> 09:44.417
AND YOU PUBLICLY REJECTED ME?

09:44.417 --> 09:45.985
OH GOD, YOU'RE SEXY.

09:45.985 --> 09:48.621
STAY STRONG,
BONNIE, STAY STRONG!

09:48.621 --> 09:51.558
MAYBE IF YOU
HADN'T HIT ON MY FATHER,

09:51.558 --> 09:54.127
WE WOULDN'T BE
IN THIS SITUATION
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

09:54.127 --> 09:56.496
YEAH, WELL,
MAYBE IF EVERYONE
IN YOUR FAMILY

09:56.496 --> 09:58.064
DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
A GREEK GOD,

09:58.064 --> 09:59.432
I WOULDN'T HAVE HIT ON HIM!

09:59.432 --> 10:01.067
WELL, THEN MAYBE
WE CAN BOTH AGREE

10:01.067 --> 10:02.969
THAT THIS WAS
A BAD IDEA.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.071
SO... I'M GONNA GO.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.006
SO, WAIT, YOU COME
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE

10:07.006 --> 10:08.374
JUST TO TELL ME
WE'RE STILL THROUGH?

10:08.374 --> 10:11.077
YUP, PRETTY MUCH!
I'M A HORRIBLE PERSON!

10:11.077 --> 10:12.745
YEAH, WITH A GREAT ASS!

10:12.745 --> 10:15.715
I'M JUST SAYING IF WE'RE
ASKING CRAZY STRANGERS

10:15.715 --> 10:17.050
WHAT THEY THINK
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP,

10:17.050 --> 10:19.219
WHY DON'T YOU GO ASK
BARRY THE CAT GUY?

10:19.219 --> 10:22.122
I DID! HE SAID
WE'RE A BAD IDEA!

10:23.423 --> 10:25.058
AND THEN HE MEOWED.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.128
YEAH, WELL, I WOULDN'T
GET BACK TOGETHER WITH YOU

10:28.128 --> 10:29.562
IF YOU WERE
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH!

10:29.562 --> 10:31.097
I'D ONLY BE THE LAST MAN

10:31.097 --> 10:33.166
BECAUSE YOU SUCKED
THE LIFE OUT OF ALL
THE REST OF THEM!

10:33.166 --> 10:34.601
(scoffs)

10:34.601 --> 10:36.536
WELL, AT LEAST
I SUCK AT SOMETHING,

10:36.536 --> 10:39.506
YOU OVERACHIEVING,
PERFECT SPECIMEN OF A MAN!

10:41.007 --> 10:43.443
DO YOU SEE? THAT'S WHAT
A BAD RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE,

10:43.443 --> 10:45.044
NOT THIS.

10:45.044 --> 10:46.379
THIS IS WHAT
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP LOOKS LIKE.

10:46.379 --> 10:49.115
TUCKER, TELL HER
WE'RE PERFECT TOGETHER.

10:49.115 --> 10:51.551
PERFECT WOULD BE
IF YOU TWO ARGUED
AT HER PLACE

10:51.551 --> 10:53.586
AND THIS ONE WENT
TO A SHELTER.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.723
WHAT'S PERFECT?

10:56.723 --> 11:00.093
I MEAN, IF TWO CRAZY KIDS
LIKE BRAD AND I CAN'T MAKE IT,

11:00.093 --> 11:02.529
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS LOVE.

11:02.529 --> 11:06.166
RILEY, WE'VE KNOWN
OUR WHOLE LIVES THAT
WE WERE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.135
WELL, YOU HAVE.
GRANTED, I'M KIND
OF NEW TO THE PARTY,

11:09.135 --> 11:12.372
EXACTLY. I KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOU,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.040
BUT WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ME?

11:14.040 --> 11:15.308
HUH? LET'S SEE.

11:15.308 --> 11:17.977
FAVORITE FOOD, COLOR,
FLOWER AND MOVIE. GO.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.079
-OOH, I THINK I KNOW.
-WAIT. SHOULD WE WRITE
OUR ANSWERS DOWN

11:20.079 --> 11:21.414
OR JUST SHOUT 'EM OUT?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.082
NO HELP FROM YOU TWO.

11:23.082 --> 11:24.751
OKAY, OKAY,

11:24.751 --> 11:26.186
I'M GONNA GO
WITH PIZZA BAGELS,

11:26.186 --> 11:29.289
YELLOW,
CHRYSANTHEN...

11:29.289 --> 11:30.523
CHRYS...

11:31.524 --> 11:32.992
ROSES...

11:34.027 --> 11:37.163
AND ANYTHING WITH THE WORD
"TERMINATOR" IN IT.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.132
OH MY GOD.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.100
-SO WRONG.
-OH!

11:41.100 --> 11:43.036
FINE, OKAY,
LET'S SEE YOU DO ME THEN.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.571
OKAY, SPAGHETTI,

11:44.571 --> 11:46.339
BLUE, DAISIES--

11:46.339 --> 11:48.274
ALTHOUGH
YOU WOULD NEVER ADMIT IT--

11:48.274 --> 11:51.077
AND "TERMINATOR" EVERYTHING.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.081
THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.516
AND WE'VE FAILED AGAIN!

11:56.516 --> 11:59.118
RILEY, WHY DO I HAVE TO STUDY
TO BE YOUR BOYFRIEND?

11:59.118 --> 12:01.387
I CAN'T DO THIS!
YOU KNOW I DON'T TEST WELL!

12:03.056 --> 12:05.158
SO-- SO YOU'RE
BREAKING UP WITH ME?

12:05.158 --> 12:07.026
OH MY GOD!
WE'RE NOT BREAKING UP!

12:07.026 --> 12:09.662
HONESTLY, I THINK
YOUR MOM WAS RIGHT!

12:09.662 --> 12:13.099
THERE'S JUST NOWHERE
FOR THIS RELATIONSHIP
TO GO BUT DOWN.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.400
RILEY, COME ON!

12:21.341 --> 12:23.977
WELL, I DID NOT SEE THAT
WHIPPING BACK TO ME.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.181
Ben:
<i>NORMALLY, I KNOW</i>
<i>WHY A GIRL'S MAD AT ME.</i>

12:28.181 --> 12:30.116
I DIDN'T TEXT HER BACK
FAST ENOUGH.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.751
I FORGOT HER BIRTHDAY.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.353
I SLEPT
WITH HER STEPMOM.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.356
BUT THIS?
TOTALLY LOST.

12:36.356 --> 12:40.693
LOOK, NO OFFENSE,
BUT THIS LITTLE PROBLEM
OF YOURS PALES NEXT TO MINE.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.596
-WHAT PROBLEM?
-I'M LIVING WITH YOUR MOTHER.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.399
DUDE, I HAD TO LIVE
WITH HER FOR 18 YEARS.

12:46.399 --> 12:49.035
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE SHE'S YOUR MOTHER!

12:49.035 --> 12:50.737
-COME ON.
-(sighs)

12:50.737 --> 12:53.740
TOO BAD BRAD DIDN'T
STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH
TO TAKE HER OFF OUR HANDS.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.575
BRAD.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.110
WAIT, THAT'S IT.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.045
THAT'S HOW
I CAN GET HER OUT.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.747
-SEE YOU LATER.
-WAIT, WAIT. DUDE,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HELP ME

13:00.747 --> 13:02.015
FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO WITH RILEY.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.350
TULIPS, BLUE,
AND <i>THE PRINCESS BRIDE.</i>

13:04.350 --> 13:05.718
ANYTHING ELSE,
JUST CALL DANNY.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.420
HE SPEAKS FLUENT RILEY.

13:10.723 --> 13:13.426
(clicking)

13:13.426 --> 13:17.330
-(rings)
-OH. HEY, BEN.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.731
BON JURY.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.167
JUST ANOTHER EXCITING DAY
HERE IN PARIS.

13:21.167 --> 13:24.470
OR, UMM...
OR NIGHT. I MEAN NIGHT.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.706
JUST ANOTHER EXCITING NIGHT
HERE IN PARIS. (chuckles)

13:26.706 --> 13:28.374
I JUST NEED
SOME BROTHERLY ADVICE.

13:28.374 --> 13:30.710
HOW CAN I GET RILEY
TO STOP WORRYING ABOUT US?

13:30.710 --> 13:33.513
WHAT'S SHE SO WORRIED ABOUT?
I MEAN, SURE, WE FIGHT,

13:33.513 --> 13:36.115
BUT WE GET ALONG BETTER
THAN MOST BROTHERS.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.018
NOT, NOT US US.
ME AND RILEY US.

13:39.018 --> 13:42.021
SHE DOESN'T THINK I'M COMMITTED
OR PAYING ATTENTION.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.523
I FORGET WHICH ONE SHE SAID.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.025
LOOK, I JUST NEED YOU
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING
YOU KNOW ABOUT HER,

13:46.025 --> 13:48.027
SO I CAN PRETEND
THAT I KNEW IT ALL ALONG.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.396
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT RILEY,

13:50.396 --> 13:53.466
BUT ALL SHE REALLY NEEDS
TO KNOW IS THAT YOU'RE AROUND
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.068
THE LONG HAUL.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.405
I THINK I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.174
HEY, DID YOU USE MY SOAP?

14:01.174 --> 14:02.542
-(blows)
-HEY, WHO'S THAT?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.077
OH, GEORGIE...

14:04.077 --> 14:05.445
(chuckles)
AND SHE'S GOT A COLD.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.013
OH, PUT HER ON.
I WANNA SAY HI.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.048
(high-pitched)
<i>♪ DON'T LOOK AT ME ♪</i>

14:09.048 --> 14:12.051
<i>♪ I'M HIDEOUS ♪</i>

14:12.051 --> 14:14.487
WOW. BRO, NO OFFENSE,

14:14.487 --> 14:16.289
BUT GEORGIE'S GOT
SOME HAIRY KNUCKLES.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.632
I THINK THIS DEFINITELY
SAYS "LONG HAUL."

14:31.170 --> 14:33.005
Danny:
<i>NO PROBLEM.</i>
<i>THANKS ANYWAY.</i>

14:33.005 --> 14:35.408
MAN! THAT'S THE THIRD ONE
OF MY TEAMMATES

14:35.408 --> 14:38.111
WHOSE APARTMENT
IS GETTING FUMIGATED.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.546
RANGERS HAVE
A REAL PEST PROBLEM.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.383
SO DO I.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.251
ARE YOU SURE
I CAN'T JUST STAY HERE?

14:45.251 --> 14:47.120
I MEAN, THIS IS THE LAST PLACE
ANYONE WILL LOOK.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.055
-(knocks)
-WHO IS IT?

14:49.055 --> 14:50.456
IT'S ME, TUCKER.

14:50.456 --> 14:52.125
(gasps)
NOBODY'S HOME!

14:54.093 --> 14:57.230
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A SECOND
TO THINK THAT ONE THROUGH.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.699
HIDE!

15:04.137 --> 15:06.005
I KNOW YOU HAVE
NO FAITH IN US,

15:06.005 --> 15:07.740
BUT I'M HOPING YOU'LL LET ME
CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.976
YOUR FAVORITE WINE,
I BELIEVE.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.578
OH, IT IS.
AND TULIPS.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.149
BEN.
SO YOU REALLY DID KNOW?

15:16.149 --> 15:18.985
(scoffs)
I'M SO SORRY
FOR BEING SO CRAZY.

15:18.985 --> 15:22.054
-CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?
-I'LL TRY,

15:22.054 --> 15:23.990
BUT THAT'S WHAT
A RELATIONSHIP IS ABOUT,

15:23.990 --> 15:26.259
IT'S GIVE AND TAKE.
(breathes deeply)

15:26.259 --> 15:28.127
AND NOW I'D LIKE
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.762
OH MY GOD, PLEASE SAY
IT IS GARLIC BREAD,

15:29.762 --> 15:32.765
BECAUSE-- OH MY GOD.
STOP TALKING, RILEY.

15:32.765 --> 15:37.103
BEN. ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I MEAN, I CAN'T--

15:37.103 --> 15:40.206
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'M READY FOR...
EARRINGS...

15:40.206 --> 15:43.242
'CAUSE I'M ALREADY
WEARING SOME,

15:43.242 --> 15:45.378
WHICH I WILL
TAKE OFF RIGHT NOW

15:45.378 --> 15:46.712
-UGH. I HATE THESE.
-(clatters)

15:46.712 --> 15:49.282
OH, I LOVE THESE.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.617
YOU KNOW I GAVE YOU
THOSE TOO, RIGHT?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.362
TUCKER, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY,

16:03.362 --> 16:05.031
I'M NOT GETTING
BACK TOGETHER WITH BONNIE.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.266
BUT SHE'S SO SWEET AND KIND.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.636
YEAH, SHE'S LIKE
A DELICATE FLOWER.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.505
(Bonnie pounding on door)
BRAD!

16:12.505 --> 16:15.141
OPEN THIS DAMN DOOR
IMMEDIATELY,

16:15.141 --> 16:17.977
OR I WILL BREAK IT DOWN
AND BEAT YOU WITH IT!

16:20.346 --> 16:22.682
WELL, THERE'S THE FLOWER NOW.

16:24.083 --> 16:26.052
(whispers)
I HAVE TO HIDE! CURTAINS!

16:26.052 --> 16:27.086
CLOSET.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.989
-(whispers)
-(whimpers)

16:31.324 --> 16:33.025
(whispers)

16:34.060 --> 16:35.228
PHEW!

16:36.496 --> 16:38.531
BONNIE. (chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:38.531 --> 16:41.501
YOU KNOW WHAT, BRAD?
YOU DO NOT GET THE LAST WORD
WITH THIS.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.970
AND WHY DON'T YOU WANT
TO GO OUT WITH ME?

16:43.970 --> 16:45.471
I'M AMAZING!

16:46.539 --> 16:47.707
AND BY THE WAY,

16:47.707 --> 16:49.075
YOU CAME TO MY HOUSE.

16:49.075 --> 16:50.977
I DID NOT SHOW UP AT YOURS!

16:50.977 --> 16:53.012
BUT YOU'RE AT MY HOUSE NOW.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.748
YEAH, WELL,
IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING

16:55.748 --> 16:59.285
WE SHOULD HAVE MAKE-UP SEX
RIGHT NOW ON THIS AMAZING, WHITE
LEATHER COUCH,

16:59.285 --> 17:01.020
I WOULD HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT IT FOR A FEW MINUTES,

17:01.020 --> 17:03.055
AND THEN I WOULD
PROBABLY SAY NO.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.590
-(keys jingle)
-(kicks)

17:04.590 --> 17:06.092
CRAP, IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.326
JUST A SECOND, HONEY!

17:07.326 --> 17:08.995
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE DOOR!

17:08.995 --> 17:11.097
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
HOW COULD YOU?

17:11.097 --> 17:13.699
IT WAS PRETTY EASY.
I MEAN, HELLO!

17:13.699 --> 17:15.401
BUT SERIOUSLY,
YOU HAVE TO GO HIDE.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.669
SHE'S REALLY JEALOUS OF YOU.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.671
SHE IS?
SO YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT ME?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.606
-GO! GO! GO!
-CURTAIN?

17:20.606 --> 17:21.607
-NO.
-CLOSET?

17:21.607 --> 17:22.608
-NO!
-BATHROOM?

17:22.608 --> 17:23.643
-YES.
-RIGHT.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.047
JENNIFER, YOU'RE EARLY.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.082
THANKS, BRAD, SEE YOU LATER.
I'VE GOT SOME LOCKS TO CHANGE!

17:30.082 --> 17:33.519
NO, YOU DON'T,
YOU LITTLE...

17:33.519 --> 17:35.388
(chuckles) OKAY.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.193
(chuckles)
JENNIFER, WHY DON'T YOU

17:41.193 --> 17:44.730
TAKE A SEAT,
AND I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.267
SO SHOULD I JUST
STAY BACK HERE FOR THIS OR...

17:52.138 --> 17:54.340
MMM! SO GOOD.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.275
PARMESAN,
ONE OF YOUR FAVORITES.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.544
BEN, YOU ARE TRULY AMAZING.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.614
HEY, PSYCHIC LADY,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.683
YOU SEE THIS?
US, TOGETHER, HAPPY.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.351
NO BIG BLOWUP,
NO BIG BREAK.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.119
TURNS OUT
WE'RE TOTALLY FINE.

18:07.119 --> 18:08.754
OH. OH!

18:08.754 --> 18:11.223
REALLY?
BECAUSE SHE KINDA LOOKS

18:11.223 --> 18:13.125
LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF FINE.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.094
(bangs table)
RILEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

18:19.098 --> 18:21.100
MY TONGUE FEELS KINDA FAT.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.104
I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THE FOOD.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.206
I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOUR FACE.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.477
THE FOOD'S FINE, YEAH.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.312
EGGPLANT PARMESAN,
YOUR FAVORITE.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.147
EGGPLANT?

18:35.147 --> 18:35.982
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.283
I AM ALLERGIC TO EGGPLANT!

18:37.283 --> 18:39.251
CHICKEN PARMESAN
IS MY FAVORITE!

18:39.251 --> 18:41.988
OH MY GOD, MAYBE I DIDN'T
WRITE THAT DOWN.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.990
(gulps, choking)

18:43.990 --> 18:45.458
-BEN? BEN!
-I'M CHOKING.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.393
OH GOD.
NO, NO, NO!

18:47.393 --> 18:48.461
IT'S OKAY!
I'VE GOT IT!

18:48.461 --> 18:49.528
I WAS A GIRL SCOUT.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.263
ONE, TWO, THREE.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.199
-(gasping)
-(cracks)

18:53.199 --> 18:54.734
I THINK YOU BROKE A RIB.
OH MY GOD.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.003
BEN, I'M SO SORRY.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.205
A BLOWUP
AND A GIANT BREAK.

18:59.205 --> 19:02.308
YES! AND MY MOM WANTED ME
TO BE A DOCTOR!

19:02.308 --> 19:03.976
(laughs)

19:08.314 --> 19:09.982
(chuckles)

19:09.982 --> 19:11.984
AGAIN, I'M SO SORRY.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.986
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW
MY OWN STRENGTH.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.721
WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

19:15.721 --> 19:17.156
THE NURSE THOUGHT
WE MADE A CUTE COUPLE.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.526
I'M SORRY
FOR BEING SO INSANE.

19:20.526 --> 19:23.763
I GUESS I JUST
CAUGHT UP WORRYING ABOUT
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.165
WHO CARES
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.600
OTHER PEOPLE ARE STUPID.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.201
YES, THEY ARE.

19:29.201 --> 19:31.037
-(both laugh)
-OH, AND BY THE WAY,

19:31.037 --> 19:33.706
THE ANSWER IS "C,"
A QUIET NIGHT AT HOME,

19:33.706 --> 19:35.975
JUST THE THREE OF US.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.110
(panting) YES!

19:38.110 --> 19:39.378
FIRST ONE BACK!

19:39.378 --> 19:42.048
AND THAT IS WHY
I ALWAYS CARRY

19:42.048 --> 19:43.416
A BAG OF MARBLES, HUH?

19:45.017 --> 19:47.319
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE BEAT BY A LADY?

19:47.319 --> 19:49.555
THE ONLY LADY I SAW

19:49.555 --> 19:52.258
WAS THE ONE YOU PULLED OUT
OF THAT MOVING TAXI.

19:52.258 --> 19:54.126
YEAH, WELL,
IF YOU NEED ME,

19:54.126 --> 19:55.394
I WILL BE
IN THE WINNER'S CIRCLE.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.229
A.K.A., MY ROOM.

19:57.229 --> 20:00.066
IT'S NOT YOUR ROOM!
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

20:00.066 --> 20:02.234
HEY, DID YOU SEE THAT TRAMP
THAT BRAD IS GOING OUT WITH?

20:02.234 --> 20:04.103
I KNOW, RIGHT?
YOU'RE SO MUCH PRETTIER
THAN SHE IS.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.005
(indistinct chatter)

20:07.173 --> 20:09.341
SECOND FAVORITE,
"B," DINNER AND A MOVIE.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.077
-(gasps)
-OH, AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW

20:11.077 --> 20:13.079
THAT <i>THE PRINCESS BRIDE</i> IS
PLAYING AT THE KINGSLEY.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.747
OH, THAT'S MY FAVORITE.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.450
-I KNOW.
-BUT YOU HATE THAT MOVIE.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.051
YOU SAID IT WAS
BORING AND STUPID.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.720
WELL, FROM NOW ON,
I'M GONNA PAY ATTENTION

20:20.720 --> 20:23.489
TO THINGS THAT YOU LOVE.
YOU'LL SEE.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.491
-(snoring)
-(sniffling)

20:25.491 --> 20:27.493
(music playing)

20:29.361 --> 20:31.397
(sniffling)

20:33.699 --> 20:36.635
(whispers) SORRY.
IT'S MY FAVORITE MOVIE.

20:37.703 --> 20:39.071
DANNY?

20:47.446 --> 20:50.416
HMM. DID YOU MOVE RECENTLY?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.051
YES. YES, I DID.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.086
I DON'T THINK YOUR NEW
SURROUNDINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.055
IN FACT, I'D SAY

20:56.055 --> 20:58.691
YOU'RE LIVING UNDER
A BLACK CLOUD.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.359
OH MY GOD, THANK YOU.

21:00.359 --> 21:01.427
ALL RIGHT,
I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT

21:01.427 --> 21:02.661
A WAY TO GET MY PLACE BACK.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.130
YOU ARE AMAZING.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.664
DO YOU NEED A ROOMMATE?
OKAY, NEVER MIND.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.003
(sighs)

21:12.705 --> 21:15.174
"BLACK CLOUD."
(chuckles)

21:15.174 --> 21:17.009
NICE TOUCH.
