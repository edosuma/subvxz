<i>Someone once said, "We don't
stop playing because we grow old.</i>

00:39.706 --> 00:41.913
<i>"We grow old because we stop playing."</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:46.957
<i>When you're a kid, you can't imagine
having any other group of friends.</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:49.041
<i>You think you're gonna be
buddies forever.</i>

00:49.508 --> 00:52.216
<i>Of course, for most people,
that just doesn't happen.</i>

00:53.470 --> 00:57.134
<i>But my friends and I,
we figured out a way around that.</i>

00:57.599 --> 01:00.182
<i>We just never stopped playing.</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:04.019
<i>And I like to think that simple thing,
playing</i> a <i>game,</i>

01:04.105 --> 01:07.644
<i>is what made me the man I am today.</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:14.772
So the man you are today
wants to be a janitor.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.399
Yes.

01:16.827 --> 01:19.410
Look, Doctor Malloy,
I'm looking at your résumé.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.533
It says you got a Ph.D.
in veterinary medicine

01:21.748 --> 01:24.410
and that you actually
have a successful practice right now.

01:24.835 --> 01:28.669
Look, there comes a time
in every man's life

01:28.839 --> 01:30.455
where you just gotta take stock,

01:30.632 --> 01:34.876
ask yourself what's really important,
what's on your bucket list.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.386
So let me get this straight.

01:37.472 --> 01:41.591
On your bucket list, you don't have,
like, skydiving or rock climbing,

01:41.685 --> 01:43.050
or tap dancing, maybe?

01:43.145 --> 01:44.351
Dancing with wolves,

01:44.438 --> 01:45.803
I believe that has to be a thing.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.513
They wouldn't have made a movie
if it wasn't, you know?

01:47.608 --> 01:51.192
All I know is that, for me,
what I really want

01:51.361 --> 01:57.232
is to clean the urine off
of that man's toilet seat.

01:57.743 --> 01:58.733
Talking about the boss.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.486
Mr. Callahan.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.154
Yeah, he's a great man.
This is a great company.

02:04.249 --> 02:07.037
Anything I can do
to get closer to that guy, sign me up.

02:07.836 --> 02:08.951
Okay, look, man.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.664
Honestly, any other situation,

02:10.756 --> 02:12.963
I would just tell you
to get the fuck out my office, okay?

02:13.050 --> 02:16.714
But we do need the help,
so when can you start?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.345
I've already begun.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.596
What the fuck was that?

02:26.104 --> 02:27.686
- Uh...
- I haven't even opened that yet.

02:28.023 --> 02:30.685
Uh, I'm sorry.
I was trying to be proactive.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.146
Today. I can start today. Um...

02:34.780 --> 02:35.770
Why don't I get you another Coke?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.480
- You do that, we good.
- Okay.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.315
But don't throw away no more new stuff.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.324
You will not be disappointed.

02:41.453 --> 02:42.659
We don't have to shake hands, man.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.828
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Sure.

02:46.917 --> 02:47.998
White people.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.340
All right, Bob. You're the CEO
of a Fortune 800 company.

02:56.426 --> 02:59.885
You have commanded the respect
of coworkers and vendors alike,

02:59.971 --> 03:02.884
and that is why you're being interviewed
by the big boys.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.341
<i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

03:09.523 --> 03:10.684
- Miss Crosby.
- Oh. Hi.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.598
- Hi. Bob Callahan.
- Rebecca.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.979
Thank you so much
for taking the time.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.233
Oh, thank you.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.982
Should we just get right into it?

03:18.073 --> 03:19.563
- Yeah, let's jump right in.
- All right.

03:19.658 --> 03:22.116
Well, here's what I would love for your
readers to know about our company.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.404
We are young.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.736
We are dynamic. We are fun.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.660
Uh, so let's talk about diabetes.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.458
Mr. Callahan,
how do you respond to the idea

03:31.545 --> 03:33.832
that your industry
uses captive insurance

03:33.922 --> 03:35.333
to move risk off balance sheets?

03:36.383 --> 03:39.921
Well, great question. Tough, but fair.

03:40.637 --> 03:45.382
Um, I guess I would say that
what I love about Freedom Atlantic

03:45.475 --> 03:47.637
is that we're not like
other insurance companies.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.938
Uh, we're big, but small.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.222
Uh... Small.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.020
We are, um...

03:56.361 --> 03:57.351
You know, we're complex...

03:59.239 --> 04:00.695
...and yet, also simple.

04:00.824 --> 04:04.658
And we are global...

04:06.997 --> 04:08.158
Yet local.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.534
That's exactly right.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.614
Sorry, one second.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.201
Uh, hey, could you maybe come back
at another time?

04:13.295 --> 04:14.831
We're just right in the middle
of something. Sir?

04:14.921 --> 04:18.334
I'm afraid not, Bob.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.165
Jesus Christ, Hoagie!

04:20.260 --> 04:21.500
What are you doing here?

04:21.595 --> 04:22.585
How did you get past security?

04:22.679 --> 04:24.295
I didn't. I work here.

04:25.223 --> 04:28.807
You got a job at my company,
so you could try to tag me?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.384
Come on. Bob, it's over.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.641
You don't think I can escape
from my own conference room?

04:32.856 --> 04:33.846
Where are you gonna go?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.523
Well, guess what? Watch now
'cause this is happening.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.815
- God dang it!
- Okay.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.151
- Oh... Ouch.
- You okay?

04:43.325 --> 04:44.611
God. Okay.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.775
You're right.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.192
It's over.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.579
- Well, you're it.
- Yeah, I know. All right.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.373
It's good to see you.
Good to see you, pal.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.700
- Good to see you.
- Have you lost weight?

04:54.795 --> 04:57.628
Yeah, a little bit.
Hey, listen, this is serious. Um...

04:58.465 --> 04:59.455
Jerry's quitting.

04:59.549 --> 05:00.584
What? Bullshit.

05:00.759 --> 05:02.966
I swear to God.
End of this season, he's retiring.

05:03.178 --> 05:07.547
Well, okay. But, uh, lam in the middle
of an interview. So can I--

05:07.641 --> 05:09.973
<i>- Wall Street Journal, that's so coo“
- Oh, thank you.</i>

05:10.060 --> 05:11.300
No, thank you, by the way,

05:11.394 --> 05:12.725
'cause this was the distraction
I needed.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.303
You get Bob talking about himself...

05:14.397 --> 05:16.183
It is just a feedback loop. Non-stop.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.856
- Can we talk about this outside, please?
- Yeah.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.059
Can we talk about this outside?
I'll be right back. I promise.

05:20.987 --> 05:21.977
There's three days left in May.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.985
That gives us 63 hours
to round up the guys and get him.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.066
Great. We can talk about this
over dinner.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.491
What? No, no, no. We have to go now!

05:28.662 --> 05:30.653
Don't you have bathrooms to clean
or something?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.071
Technically, yes, I do.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.239
All right, well, you know what?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.664
- Take this ridiculous thing off...
- Ow.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.624
...and get to it.
We'll talk about this later.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.873
I'll resign, Bob.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.375
You don't have to. You're fired.

05:40.549 --> 05:42.210
Oh, good. 'Cause the benefits here suck!

05:42.384 --> 05:43.465
No, they don't.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.751
That's true. Benefits are really good.

05:48.139 --> 05:50.972
Oh, hey, sorry about that.
Uh, where were we?

05:51.059 --> 05:52.925
- Uh, diabetes. Yes.
- Explain.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.727
Well, uh... I'm not a doctor,
but there are two types.

05:56.231 --> 06:01.271
Type one is called "Type One".
And Type Two is more of an adult onset.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.897
No. Him.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.446
- What are you doing?
- Hoagie, what do you want?

06:06.533 --> 06:07.739
You tagged me. I'm it, okay?

06:07.826 --> 06:09.817
You're sitting there
like I didn't just tell you

06:09.911 --> 06:11.322
we gotta deal with this right now.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.572
Because we got a real shot
at Jerry this year.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.781
You say that every year.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.992
- Yeah, but this year's different.
- You say that every year.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.373
- But this year's really different.
- You said that last year.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.749
I know, you're right.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.589
But this year's actually different

06:25.468 --> 06:28.551
because we know exactly
where he's going to be and when.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.845
"The wedding celebration
of Susan and Jerry.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.096
"Saturday, May 31st."

06:35.228 --> 06:37.390
He's a sitting duck!

06:38.356 --> 06:41.064
We gotta join forces. We get Jerry now,

06:42.193 --> 06:43.183
or we die.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.354
- What?
- Eventually. You know what I mean.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.489
Come on, Bob.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.572
You gonna grow old,
or you gonna keep playing?

06:59.085 --> 07:00.075
Keep playing.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.712
That is the right answer.
Nice to meet you.

07:03.882 --> 07:04.872
- Uh...
- I'm sorry. I have to go.

07:04.966 --> 07:05.956
No. Uh...

07:07.135 --> 07:08.125
Hold on. Hold on.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.926
I can't believe he's getting married,
and he didn't even tell us.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.300
I know. I was mad at first, too,
and then hurt.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.927
But, you know, he just realized
he'd be a sitting target.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.591
That's insane, even for him.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.053
Will one of you please tell me
what's going on here?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.429
Are we off the record?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.146
No, definitely not.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.223
Awesome. Okay.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.901
Our group of friends has been playing
the same game of tag for 30 years.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.272
What?

07:27.364 --> 07:30.698
For the entire month of May,
every year, we play tag.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.774
Just like when we were kids.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.779
But we're not on a playground,
and we all live in different cities.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.157
So you don't ever know
when someone's gonna pop up.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.487
You could be shopping at the mall,

07:37.582 --> 07:39.072
and then your buddy
jumps out of the trunk

07:39.167 --> 07:40.953
and, boom, tags you. You're it.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.117
Here's the craziest part.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.704
Our buddy, Jerry, never been tagged.

07:44.923 --> 07:48.336
What do you mean he's never been tagged?
You never put your hand on his body?

07:48.426 --> 07:50.633
Not during the month of May.
For like, 30 years.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.712
Why don't you just go over to his house
and tag him?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.760
- It's not that easy.
- Why not?

07:55.850 --> 07:57.432
Because...

07:59.521 --> 08:02.980
<i>Well, for starters,
because he's so freaking fast.</i>

08:04.442 --> 08:05.648
<i>You just can't catch him.</i>

08:06.236 --> 08:08.568
<i>Yeah,
and if you do manage to catch him,</i>

08:08.655 --> 08:12.489
<i>then he goes feral and turns into
some kind of crazy wild animal.</i>

08:16.454 --> 08:19.446
<i>And if you manage
to trap the wild animal,</i>

08:21.167 --> 08:22.783
<i>he still finds a way.</i>

08:24.921 --> 08:25.911
<i>What just happened there?</i>

08:26.172 --> 08:28.288
To this day, I have no idea. No idea.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.422
He's the best that ever played. Yeah.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.006
And now, he wants to retire
with a perfect record,

08:35.097 --> 08:39.183
make us all look like fools. Fools!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.138
He gets very excited.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.428
There he is.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.022
Wait. You're not leaving.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.349
Look, Ms. Crosby, I apologize.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.313
Uh, I will have someone from my office
reach out to you.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.145
We will reschedule this
as soon as I'm back in town.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.567
Uh, nope.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.152
- Nope?
- No. Change of plan.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.324
I'm coming with you.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.947
This is a story.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.028
What? No.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.204
Yes. This is the coolest game ever.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.622
I don't think that's gonna be her angle.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.245
I don't know what my angle is,

09:04.461 --> 09:07.078
but I do find it very interesting
that we live in a world

09:07.172 --> 09:09.004
where grown men take an entire month

09:09.090 --> 09:10.546
out of every year
to play a child's game.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.754
It's very interesting.
You're right. Let's go.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.340
I don't think she means interesting
in a good way.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.138
- Get in, Bob.
- Fine! Fuck it, I'm going.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.739
All right, it's all ready for you, Dad.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.914
Hey! Thank you. Thank you.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.253
I'll be honest with you.
Ever since my wife died,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.051
you've really been the rock
holding me down.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.845
So thank you.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.434
Well, I appreciate that.
I really do.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.183
But your wife is not dead.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.140
Well, she's dead to me.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.476
What?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.357
Yeah.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.563
- That's right.
- That's right.

10:16.658 --> 10:18.274
Listen to me.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.528
"To live in the past is
to die in the present."

10:22.747 --> 10:23.737
Now, who said that?

10:23.998 --> 10:26.365
- You did.
- Bill Belichick said that!

10:26.459 --> 10:28.041
God love him. Yes, sir.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.584
All right, I'm gonna get us more weed.

10:29.671 --> 10:30.661
God bless you, son.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.709
Damn, that was fast!

10:39.430 --> 10:40.670
- Hey!
- Hey, Anna.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.881
- Hey, Chilli. How are you?
- Good, nice to see you.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.091
What are you doing here?

10:44.435 --> 10:46.642
I was... I was walking by

10:47.856 --> 10:50.644
and thought I'd pop in
and say hi to you and Roger.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.223
Yeah, we're doing great. Where's Hoagie?

10:53.236 --> 10:55.603
Oh, um... He's, um...
You know...

10:55.697 --> 10:59.110
- Oh, shit!
- Hogan's in, uh, the library.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.071
Is it... Dad, what month is it?

11:03.079 --> 11:04.114
May.

11:05.206 --> 11:07.072
Mmm-mmm. You're not getting by me.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.410
Anna, are you okay?

11:11.796 --> 11:13.412
He's loose! He's loose!

11:13.506 --> 11:14.496
Fuck it.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.581
Hogan, honey, he's coming.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.210
He's heading down the east stairwell.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.802
- Hey. Hogan!
- Hey, Chilli!

11:28.897 --> 11:30.888
I haven't seen you in a while, man.
How's everything?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.723
- Pretty good. Yeah, what about you?
- Good, yeah.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.353
Everything's good, man. Yeah, work.
I mean, I'm going through that divorce.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.310
- You sure?
- But, everything's fine. It's fine.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.275
Hey, also, side note.
Stop bringing your wife into this, man.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.652
That's bullshit.
She's way too intense for the game.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.529
You're just jealous
'cause she's such a badass.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.027
She's my secret weapon.
Kind of worked 'cause you're trapped.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.537
- Am I trapped?
- Yeah.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.243
I am?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.041
Damn you, Chilli!

12:00.762 --> 12:01.797
Jesus, Chilli!

12:01.888 --> 12:03.174
That's trash!

12:15.318 --> 12:17.400
Fuck me!

12:18.363 --> 12:19.478
Oh, hey, Martin!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.026
Oh. Hi. Sorry.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.080
Excuse me, Mrs. Martin.
Coming through.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.007
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:43.096 --> 12:47.385
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
So sorry. Wow. Okay.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.885
Get him, Andy!

12:54.732 --> 12:56.689
Good, Andy, good!

13:03.032 --> 13:04.193
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.195
Chilli, Chilli, Chilli...

13:08.162 --> 13:11.154
Chilli! No, no, no!

13:24.554 --> 13:26.170
Oh, fuck!

13:26.347 --> 13:28.054
You okay, buddy?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.304
Oh, just great. Great.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.682
You ain't getting me today, man.
I'm not losing.

13:34.772 --> 13:35.887
There's only one problem, Chilli.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.973
On, yeah? What's that?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.808
I'm not it.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.318
The fuck you mean,
you're not it?

13:42.488 --> 13:43.569
I am, motherfucker!

13:44.907 --> 13:45.897
Oh!

13:47.410 --> 13:50.027
- It! Come on. Get up.
- Goddamn!

13:50.204 --> 13:51.285
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.908
You took a pretty big hit there. My God.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.285
Yeah, I thought I got away.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.163
- Set him up. Knock him down.
- Oh, my God!

13:57.253 --> 13:58.243
- Good idea.
- All right, fair and square.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.328
- I'm it, right?
- Yes.

13:59.422 --> 14:00.457
And now you're it.

14:01.424 --> 14:02.835
- Whoa. Nope.
- Yeah.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.381
Nope. I'm not taking it.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.630
No, I'm not. No!

14:05.803 --> 14:07.089
- No.
- We're not... No!

14:07.263 --> 14:08.298
Guys, we're too old for...

14:10.933 --> 14:12.014
No, don't start hitting. God.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.513
No, no, you're it.
I don't know who is it.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.475
- You're it. You're it.
- Guys, guys!

14:17.565 --> 14:19.727
- This is ridiculous.
- Son of a bitch! You sack punched me!

14:19.817 --> 14:21.478
- Well, you punched me!
- You sack punched him?

14:21.652 --> 14:22.938
Yeah, you went crazy, and now you're it.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.102
- Sorry.
- Okay, I'm it.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.687
Truce, truce, truce.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.772
Deal.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.322
This isn't about us anyway.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.651
This is the year we get Jerry.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.362
- Oh, we're not gonna get Jerry.
- He said the same thing.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.868
No, no. I said the same thing.
We got a plan, all right?

14:38.669 --> 14:39.909
Guys! Guys, let's go.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.455
She's so intense, man.
She takes it too far.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.789
You know what? If it wasn't for me,
you guys would be day drunk,

14:44.884 --> 14:46.249
playing mini-golf with 12-year-olds.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.006
Let's go. I know where Sable is.
Get in the car, ladies.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.713
Yeah, we're going right to the airport,
so grab a bag, grab a...

14:50.807 --> 14:52.923
- A toothbrush or whatever.
- I'm good. Let's go.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.262
- Really?
- Wow!

14:54.352 --> 14:55.467
- That's gross.
- Well, he's gung-ho. That's good.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.222
Hey, Rebecca,
we're gonna go get Sable now.

14:57.772 --> 14:58.807
Who is Sable?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.442
I know you think
she's not cheating on me.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.070
But what about the possibility

15:07.240 --> 15:09.447
of her knowing that I'm following her
to Pilates class,

15:09.534 --> 15:11.571
and on the days
when it's not Pilates class,

15:11.661 --> 15:15.029
that's when she has all the free time
to ride random dick.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.623
Okay, riding dicks.

15:19.085 --> 15:21.918
Kevin, you're really focused
on other dicks.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.545
But what about yours? What about you?

15:24.632 --> 15:26.043
If you don't focus on the other dicks,

15:26.134 --> 15:28.751
those dicks will plug up
the places you wanna go.

15:28.845 --> 15:33.339
What about mentally
going into each of those holes

15:33.516 --> 15:38.386
and unplugging every one of those dicks.
Pulling out, pulling out, pulling out.

15:39.063 --> 15:41.475
And then you have a clear mind.
Dickless.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.812
Well, I'm paranoid
that my original paranoia

15:44.902 --> 15:46.358
might turn on my paranoia.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.021
It sounds like there are
some fundamental trust issues.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.780
You can't trust anybody.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.278
I don't think anyone's out to get you.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.984
I don't think anyone is following you.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.159
Ow! Stop!

15:55.246 --> 15:56.236
I can't take it anymore.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.867
I can't take it. I can't listen to this.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.031
Are you shushing me?

16:04.338 --> 16:05.453
What the fuck?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.339
- Oh, wow!
- How are you?

16:08.426 --> 16:10.383
- Doctor!
- You're there.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.385
Hi, Hogan. Nice to meet you.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.678
Bob Callahan. How do you do?

16:13.764 --> 16:15.220
- Sorry, this is a terrible idea.
- Who are you?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.673
We're friends of Sable's.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.635
We thought it'd be really funny
to hide in there,

16:19.729 --> 16:21.640
but then we overheard way too much.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.314
Yeah, buddy, you're clearly
going through a lot of shit.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.807
All right, get here, man.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.394
And, um, also, you're it, so...

16:28.571 --> 16:31.063
I don't care. I miss you.
How are you, buddy? Good to see you.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.613
- I'm good.
- Yup.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.065
- Now you're it.
- I know. I know. I'm it.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.618
Anyway, yeah, we came to get you,
so come on.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.944
- Sable. Come on.
- Come on.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.905
I got 40 minutes left in the session.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.287
- So what? This is important.
- Yeah.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.419
Pack your bags. We're going home.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.623
I don't have my bags here.

16:50.009 --> 16:50.999
- Yeah, we know.
- Obviously.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.083
- For fuck's sake.
- I know that. It's just--

16:52.178 --> 16:53.509
We will go by your house
and get your stuff.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.007
You should've just went to my house
in the first place

16:55.097 --> 16:56.087
if we were gonna go to my house anyway.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.139
- This seemed like a better idea.
- It was a whole bit! Let's go.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.557
Yeah, come on, we'll figure it out.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.100
Okay, you'll still owe me for this hour.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.177
Thanks, Doctor.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.262
You guys aren't taking
my mental health seriously.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.663
Look at those little assholes.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.295
- Calm down.
- It's awful to be back.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.592
It's gonna be fun.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.988
Ah! It still smells the same.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.530
Uh... Here we go.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.995
All right!

18:18.014 --> 18:19.254
- Oh!

18:23.519 --> 18:24.634
Okay, yeah.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.143
Oh, yeah, it's still there.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.395
Guys, we're back in the war room.

18:32.737 --> 18:33.727
You know what that means.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.232
No, I don't know what that means.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.323
It means we're going to war, Sable.
Now, just to be clear,

18:38.409 --> 18:41.822
we're not gonna tag Jerry
at the actual wedding ceremony

18:41.912 --> 18:44.495
because, frankly,
that would make <i>us</i> giant assholes.

18:44.582 --> 18:45.993
I'm sorry. I thought that was
the whole point of this.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.950
I took two weeks unpaid vacation
for that exact reason.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.581
- Two weeks?
- Yeah.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.291
I'm going zip-lining after this.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.583
Okay. There's gonna be plenty of time
to get him before the ceremony.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.962
There's a rehearsal dinner.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.921
There's a luncheon, photo shoot.
Just don't worry. We're gonna get him.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.382
Very official plan. Who wants to smoke
some weed with me? Sable!

19:03.476 --> 19:04.591
I'll take a toke.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.384
What?

19:06.479 --> 19:11.064
Yeah, I've been, uh, you know,
experimenting with pot recently.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.024
Mostly medicinal, but hey.

19:13.194 --> 19:17.188
I've wanted to get high with you
my entire life, Hogan.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.488
- Honestly.
- Let's do it.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.361
- This is the best gift of all time.
- Okay.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.737
This is exactly how I imagined it,
by the way.

19:28.918 --> 19:29.908
Hoagie's mom.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.579
I've got pizza rolls
for my pizza roll boys.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.505
Ooh. Pizza rolls.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.551
Is that marijuana I smell?

19:43.724 --> 19:45.431
No. What?

19:45.601 --> 19:48.639
It's my pot. I'm really sorry.
I was smoking pot. It's an old habit.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.475
Oh, so it's your weedie.

19:53.401 --> 19:55.187
I think I'm getting a contact high.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.351
Okay.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.066
Hits me deep. Below the belt, you know.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.947
I've got a belt upstairs.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.028
I use it on naughty little boys.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.157
What the fuck is going on?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.034
I hope you don't hurt those boys.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.540
I don't mean to.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.373
It was really nice speaking with you.
Thank you for the pizza rolls.

20:14.547 --> 20:18.541
Mom, stop flirting with Chilli.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.585
Linda, have you seen Jerry lately?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.344
I mean, do you still play tennis
with his mom?

20:23.514 --> 20:24.879
Because we need to find him
before the wedding,

20:24.974 --> 20:26.055
and we've got no clues.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.011
I don't even talk to her.
I never see her at the club.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.644
But I'm thrilled for Jerry.
Susan is such a nice girl.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.813
- We just need the information.
- Yeah, we need to find him. Yeah.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.099
Have you taken the guys
over to the Sandpiper?

20:36.277 --> 20:40.441
Lou does nothing but talk about you
and the old days and Jerry.

20:41.365 --> 20:42.855
You know, I think he's lonely.

20:43.033 --> 20:45.445
Okay, that's not helpful. But it...

20:45.619 --> 20:46.609
Oh, my God!

20:46.787 --> 20:48.277
Lou knows everything
going on in this town.

20:48.456 --> 20:50.322
Guys, we're going to the Sandpiper.

20:50.416 --> 20:53.374
I don't wanna go to the Sandpiper.
I'm having a great time here.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.626
I miss this basement.
We don't have any more beer.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.082
Let's go to the Sandpiper.

21:09.518 --> 21:10.633
Lou!

21:11.437 --> 21:13.724
Gentlemen! And ladies.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.311
How are you guys?
Hey, we have new summer stouts on draft.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.897
Lou, we don't give a shit about summer
stouts. We're just looking for Jerry.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.604
Ooh, I hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings, Anna,

21:22.782 --> 21:24.272
but you are technically
still banned from here.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.569
- What? Still?
- What?

21:26.660 --> 21:28.025
It was dollar margarita night, Lou.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.360
Hey, I don't make the rules.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.653
Fuck you, Lou.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.373
You know something about Jerry.
I can see it in your eyes, you rat fuck.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.788
I don't know where Jerry is.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.168
Fuck you. Tell us.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.207
I'm sorry, Lou. I'm so sorry.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.292
How are you'? How's your mom?

21:44.470 --> 21:45.710
- Fantastic.
- Oh, that's good.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.045
- Fit as a fiddle.
- Tell her I said hi.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.129
I will, for sure.
She'll love hearing that.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.305
And fuck you.
I don't wanna be in this bar anyway.

21:49.391 --> 21:50.756
- Okay, okay.
- We're gonna wait outside.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.643
Look forward to catching up with y'all.
Whoo!

21:53.729 --> 21:56.437
Listen, I'll tell you everything
you need to know about Jerry

21:56.607 --> 22:00.896
if you tag me just one time.
It is all I ask. I will spill.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.310
Why Can't I tag you?

22:03.447 --> 22:05.984
Because I'm not officially in the game.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.193
What's the good word, Lou?

22:07.368 --> 22:09.530
We don't stop playing
'cause we grow old.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.694
We grow old because we stop playing.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.328
You are not part of this game.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.489
Benjamin Franklin.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.165
- Lou.
- Yeah?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.325
Where's Jerry?

22:17.795 --> 22:19.081
I'm afraid I can't help you out
with that, boys.

22:19.255 --> 22:20.871
- Really?
- Yeah, you see,

22:21.048 --> 22:22.664
Jerry and I struck a little deal.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.834
I say nothing about his whereabouts,
and then I get to play tag next year.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.593
- Jerry made that deal with you?
- Oh, yeah.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.255
And I am unbreakable, boys.

22:30.432 --> 22:32.719
Cannot penetrate this Iron Curtain.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.260
The vault is closed.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.434
Well, Lou, that is a real shame because
I was gonna introduce you to Rebecca,

22:38.607 --> 22:42.066
who is writing an article about tag
for The <i>Wall</i> Street Journal.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.358
How cool is that?

22:43.445 --> 22:44.606
- So cool.
- Isn't that exciting?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.904
Is there any way
that Lou could be in your article?

22:47.074 --> 22:48.064
Oh, yeah.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.357
Right? It's an interesting angle, right?

22:49.535 --> 22:51.902
Probably has to be a story
for that to happen, right?

22:51.996 --> 22:53.907
What do you mean,
there has to be a story?

22:54.957 --> 22:56.493
Well, I mean, no Jerry, no story.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.032
You need Jerry for the story?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.917
Could you imagine that thing
printed out here, framed?

23:00.004 --> 23:01.711
- Hanging on the wall? With this guy?
- Yeah.

23:01.797 --> 23:03.003
Which will get published everywhere.
Everyone will see.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.834
- Nationally.
- Don't you wanna be in the article?

23:05.009 --> 23:06.966
Yeah, dude.
I would love to be in an article.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.839
Well, we're not gonna break
Fort Knox here.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.094
Fuck, man. All right.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.971
- I was really excited about that story.
- Good to see you, buddy.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.882
- Good luck, man.
- Look, look, look.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.261
My mom talked to his mom,

23:18.439 --> 23:21.682
and she said that the rehearsal
is at the Deer Creek Country Club.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.020
- Deer Creek.
- There it is.

23:23.193 --> 23:25.059
Anyways, the name is Louis Seibert.
That's S-E-I-B...

23:25.237 --> 23:27.399
- Oh, I'll remember that. Thank you.
- She's got a great memory.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.068
Big Lou, thank you, buddy.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.777
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you bet.

23:32.995 --> 23:34.577
Oh, hello, Ms. Rollins?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.863
This is Margaret from
the Deer Creek Country Club.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.703
I'm just calling to let you know
we won't be able to refund your deposit

23:39.877 --> 23:42.244
since you canceled the rehearsal
on such short notice.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.583
<i>- SUSAN". What? Oh, my God.
- I think you have a mistake here.</i>

23:44.757 --> 23:46.464
<i>Uh, we didn't cancel
the reception.</i>

23:46.634 --> 23:50.923
I'm afraid we have unfortunately booked
something else in that time slot now.

23:51.221 --> 23:53.303
- A quinceañera.
- A quinceañera.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.385
<i>- A what?
- The fuck's a quinceañera?</i>

23:55.559 --> 23:57.049
A celebration of womanhood.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.433
It's a celebration of womanhood.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.140
<i>- This is bullshit.
- Oh, my God!</i>

24:00.314 --> 24:01.520
<i>We're coming to the club right now.</i>

24:34.515 --> 24:35.550
Hello?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.055
Hello?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.014
Hello, boys.

24:46.860 --> 24:47.850
Who is it?

24:48.779 --> 24:49.769
I am.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.401
<i>Callahan approaches
from the left.</i>

24:55.160 --> 24:57.276
<i>Engage no-contact protocol.</i>

24:59.123 --> 25:00.989
<i>No hand shall touch my body.</i>

25:06.714 --> 25:10.548
<i>. Mental note. Bob slapped Hoagie
with his hand. Hoagie is now it.</i>

25:14.471 --> 25:15.461
<i>Chilli.</i>

25:16.432 --> 25:18.298
<i>He dives at me in a pussy-like fashion.</i>

25:19.268 --> 25:21.225
<i>Poor planning. Poor execution.</i>

25:24.398 --> 25:25.433
<i>Piece of cake.</i>

25:26.525 --> 25:27.640
<i>I head for the door to escape.</i>

25:27.818 --> 25:29.058
<i>Sable blocks it.</i>

25:29.695 --> 25:31.231
<i>It's showtime.</i>

25:34.324 --> 25:37.191
<i>Hoagie has tagged Sable.
He is now fair game.</i>

25:39.329 --> 25:40.364
<i>I speedbag him.</i>

25:56.847 --> 25:58.429
Jerry! You okay?

26:00.559 --> 26:01.970
Oh, I've never been better.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.761
Welcome home, boys!

26:07.691 --> 26:08.977
Hey, who's this with you?

26:09.151 --> 26:11.984
Oh, this is Rebecca. She's a reporter.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.152
Very famous.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.525
Did they, uh, mention that
I haven't been tagged in 30 years

26:15.699 --> 26:17.030
'cause they suck at this game?

26:17.117 --> 26:18.152
Extensively.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.654
Never been tagged. Just saying.

26:19.828 --> 26:20.863
I can't believe you would rather

26:20.954 --> 26:22.695
not invite your closest friends
to your wedding

26:22.873 --> 26:23.988
than risk getting tagged.

26:24.166 --> 26:27.375
Hey, Bob, look, you're here, ain't you?
Right? I knew you'd come.

26:27.461 --> 26:28.951
Cookie, the valet needs the keys.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.711
Hi, baby. Come here, honey. Come here.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.747
We didn't invite you.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.962
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Uh, guys.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.796
This is Susan, my soon-to-be-bride.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.552
- Hi. Nice to meet you, Susan.
- Hey.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.837
- Hi.
- She'll explain why.

26:40.015 --> 26:43.098
It's just...
I know it sounds really crazy.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.431
It's just, everyone on my mother's side
have had May weddings,

26:46.605 --> 26:49.097
and I don't want
my wedding ruined over...

26:49.316 --> 26:52.525
I swear, I don't wanna be that woman,

26:52.778 --> 26:57.318
but I do feel like that woman is kind
of understandable in this situation.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.489
Don't make excuses, baby.
You don't have to. Come on.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.571
Look, I already broke a fucking window.
What are we gonna do here, guys?

27:04.248 --> 27:05.784
- Amendment.
- Amendment.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.039
Amendment. All right. Get in here.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.745
Truce. Truce, bitches.

27:10.462 --> 27:13.170
No tag at the rehearsal.
No tag at the luncheon.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.799
No tag at the dinner. And do not
even mention tag at the ceremony.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.960
Ceremony.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.841
- We got it.
- Thank you.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.129
No way, I'm not signing this.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.763
You're officially re-not invited.
How's that?

27:23.934 --> 27:24.924
Okay, then fine.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.638
I'll crash your fucking wedding,

27:26.728 --> 27:28.218
and I'll tag you
<i>as</i> you try to kiss your bride.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.644
Hey, hey, hey-

27:29.815 --> 27:31.180
Look, Susan.
You seem like a lovely person,

27:31.358 --> 27:33.065
and I'm sure this will all be fine.

27:33.235 --> 27:36.728
We just need to formalize it, something
we've been doing a long time and, uh...

27:37.948 --> 27:39.609
Sign it.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.275
What the...

27:42.828 --> 27:44.614
"No mention of tag is..."

27:44.788 --> 27:46.529
- Ridiculous.
- It's unreasonable.

27:46.707 --> 27:47.868
Thank you, GUYS-

27:47.958 --> 27:49.619
Here.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.201
All right, boys.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.671
- All right.
- So good to see you, Bob.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.049
You know what? Don't touch me when
we're on a truce. It's very patronizing.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.880
Yeah, it's a little weird for me, too.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.463
Well, it was really nice
meeting everyone,

28:03.557 --> 28:07.300
and I look forward to getting to know
you guys better this weekend and just...

28:07.394 --> 28:10.307
I don't know. I've just dreamt
about this day my whole life, so...

28:10.480 --> 28:12.221
- Congrats, Susan. We're happy for you.
- It's gonna be great.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.389
Thank you.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.473
It's really good to see you, boys.

28:14.776 --> 28:15.766
Cheers.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.644
Six tequilas, please.

28:22.618 --> 28:23.983
- To Jerry.
- Wait.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.035
Oh!

28:27.122 --> 28:29.739
So, boys, how did it go?

28:29.917 --> 28:30.998
- Not good.
- So bad.

28:31.168 --> 28:32.909
So, so bad.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.745
Did you guys just sign away
your chance to tag him?

28:35.839 --> 28:40.504
Yeah, but we're still okay
because non-wedding times are fair game.

28:40.677 --> 28:41.963
We just gotta find the right window.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.419
- What happened?
- He kicked our ass.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.717
- Well, technically, he punched my ass.
- Punched your ass.

28:45.807 --> 28:46.922
- Repeatedly.
- Hard.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.599
Well, according to the bylaws,
that is highly illegal.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.976
Except he didn't hit my asshole,

28:51.146 --> 28:52.432
-so it's legal.
- It's legal.

28:52.606 --> 28:54.188
Okay, what are you talking about?

28:54.524 --> 28:55.810
Here.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.190
Page...

28:57.361 --> 28:59.022
Yes! Right there.

28:59.655 --> 29:00.941
No asshole punching.

29:01.114 --> 29:05.324
Why would you play a game where
you're constantly punched in the ass?

29:06.745 --> 29:07.735
Fair question, Rebecca.

29:07.913 --> 29:08.903
Beep. I'll take this.

29:09.039 --> 29:12.248
Tag is more than a game.
It's a way of life.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.498
No, buddy.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.956
That's exactly right. You nailed it.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.245
Facial disgracial.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.754
Okay, Lou, thank you.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.337
We'll take it from here.
Uh...

29:22.511 --> 29:23.546
But he's exactly right.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.006
<i>It's so much more than a game.</i>

29:25.180 --> 29:27.922
Say I'm LeVar Burton.
Say I'm LeVar Burton.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.091
<i>I was there
when Sable lost his virginity.</i>

29:30.560 --> 29:32.176
God damn it, Hoagie!
I was almost finished!

29:32.354 --> 29:33.344
Get over here!

29:33.438 --> 29:36.271
<i>And Callahan was there
when Anna and I had our first child.</i>

29:37.859 --> 29:40.601
Congratulations, buddy.
You're it. Doing great, Anna.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.567
<i>And all the guys were there
for me when my father died.</i>

29:43.740 --> 29:47.449
I think your dad would have
really wanted you to be

29:47.619 --> 29:49.781
it in this moment.

29:52.207 --> 29:53.447
<i>This game,</i>

29:53.542 --> 29:56.500
<i>it's given us a reason to be
in each other's lives all these years.</i>

29:56.670 --> 29:59.833
The last it from each season
will live in shame for one year.

30:00.007 --> 30:01.793
- So what happens if you lose?
- You lose.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.123
- You're it.
- What does the winner get?

30:03.302 --> 30:05.714
There are no winners. Just not losers.

30:05.887 --> 30:09.755
I would love to sit here and deconstruct
the spirit of competition with everyone,

30:09.933 --> 30:11.264
but Jerry's still on the loose,

30:11.435 --> 30:12.721
and we've got to get him where it hurts.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.885
- Not in the asshole.
- Not in the asshole. Obviously.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.724
Oh! Guys, let's go to his house.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.263
He wouldn't be at his house.
It's too obvious.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.355
Yeah, it's too obvious,
so he's gonna be there. This is Jerry.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.941
Maybe it's so obvious that
it's not obvious that he will be there.

30:25.115 --> 30:26.901
- So he's at the house.
- He's not gonna be there.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.409
If he's there, then it'll be obvious
for him to be there,

30:30.579 --> 30:31.660
so he wouldn't be there

30:31.830 --> 30:34.697
because he would think that we would
automatically come there, obviously.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.157
What?

30:36.251 --> 30:37.412
You know what? One way to find out.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.576
Let's go.

30:38.712 --> 30:39.747
It'll be obvious to...

30:39.921 --> 30:41.161
Come on!

30:58.565 --> 31:00.147
It's locked.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.113
What do you see?

31:08.283 --> 31:09.273
It's nice.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.534
There's lot of attention to detail,
but not too overdone.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.366
Well, can you just unlock it?

31:17.626 --> 31:18.832
This is breaking and entering.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.084
No, it doesn't count
if you know the person.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.212
That is not true.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.959
"Did you guys really think
I would be home?"

31:30.055 --> 31:31.045
Feels like a trap.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.679
All right, let's split up.
We'll cover more ground.

31:32.849 --> 31:33.839
No, that's a terrible idea.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.507
He'll never expect it.

31:35.685 --> 31:37.517
Now help me out of the door, please.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.932
Jerry!

31:43.944 --> 31:45.810
He's gotta be here.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.565
Have you ever even been here before?

31:56.873 --> 31:57.908
Ooh.

31:58.667 --> 31:59.748
Deviled eggs.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.085
Delicious. These go fast.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.086
What the fuck?

32:12.722 --> 32:13.803
Oh, man.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.140
Whoa.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.968
Jerry got chloroform?

32:19.146 --> 32:22.980
What the fuck? He has stepped it up.

32:23.150 --> 32:26.984
Aerial maps of the city.
Bunch of blueprints.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.771
Five different hats? Wow.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.569
People change.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.698
Did you...

32:42.502 --> 32:43.492
I didn't do anything.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.759
<i>Who is that scampering around my house?</i>

32:56.933 --> 32:59.971
<i>Hello, boys, did you really think
I'd go home?</i>

33:00.145 --> 33:01.431
<i>- You idiots.</i>
- I <i>knew it.</i>

33:01.605 --> 33:03.687
<i>- It's too obvious.
- Yep.</i>

33:03.857 --> 33:05.347
I mean, that's just a lucky guess.

33:05.525 --> 33:06.515
Okay, Jerry, where are you?

33:06.693 --> 33:07.728
<i>You know, seeing you guys tonight</i>

33:07.903 --> 33:09.940
<i>made me wanna take a walk down
memory lane.</i>

33:10.489 --> 33:11.479
Ta-da!

33:11.656 --> 33:12.987
- Is that your...
- That's my bedroom.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.819
You're at my parents' house.
Why are you at my parents' house?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.324
<i>It's a little smaller than I remember.</i>

33:16.495 --> 33:17.985
You broke into my house!

33:18.163 --> 33:19.449
We broke into his house.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.239
Yeah, we broke into your house.

33:21.416 --> 33:22.952
<i>. Hey, hey! Look who I found, Hoag.</i>

33:23.668 --> 33:25.158
Hoagie, <i>I miss</i> you so much!

33:25.337 --> 33:26.702
What are you doing with Mr. Stubbles?

33:26.880 --> 33:28.041
<i>This little guy
got you through</i>

33:28.131 --> 33:29.371
<i>a lot of troubles in life, didn't he?</i>

33:29.549 --> 33:30.914
All right, Jerry.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.585
Let's see where this one goes.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.130
<i>Mr. Stubbles has something to say.
What was that?</i>

33:37.307 --> 33:40.140
<i>He says that his skin's very dry.
It needs to be moisturized.</i>

33:40.310 --> 33:42.972
Jerry, put down Mr. Stubbles.
So help me God.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.895
What's happening here?

33:46.066 --> 33:48.478
I think he's about to masturbate
in Hoagie's childhood bedroom.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.313
Oh, no.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.398
It's the ultimate act of dominance.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.154
<i>I'm gonna stay here until you come.</i>

33:55.242 --> 33:56.903
<i>Unless I come first.</i>

33:58.370 --> 33:59.360
You sly dog.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.997
- Go! Go! Go!
- Did you get him?

34:04.167 --> 34:05.908
- Start the car!
- I started it. I started it.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.247
Everybody put their seat belts on.

34:07.420 --> 34:08.751
Go! Go! Go!

34:08.922 --> 34:10.411
- Everybody in.
- Hold on.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.422
Is everybody in?

34:16.137 --> 34:18.754
<i>This is gonna be nice and smooth,
Mr. Stubbies.</i>

34:18.931 --> 34:20.717
<i>This isn't gonna hurt whatsoever.</i>

34:20.891 --> 34:23.429
Stay put. We're coming for you.
We're coming for you.

34:23.603 --> 34:26.812
Yeah, but <i>hurry</i> up! <i>Daddy,</i> hurry up!

34:26.982 --> 34:28.723
Mr. Stubbles is not into you.
He can't be into you.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.062
He's not a sexual being, okay?
So put him down!

34:37.993 --> 34:39.483
Hey, team.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.246
Jerry, how are you in my room right now?

34:49.379 --> 34:50.665
We're all in my room.

34:50.755 --> 34:54.339
<i>No, of course I'm not there. I'm here.
In my basement.</i>

34:54.676 --> 34:55.666
Where are you guys?

34:55.844 --> 34:58.006
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

34:58.179 --> 35:01.137
<i>He built a <i>replica
of your bedroom in his basement?</i></i>

35:01.308 --> 35:02.639
Good night, gentlemen.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.813
Ah, amateurs.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.273
Let's begin. Um...

35:16.781 --> 35:19.022
So kind of a rough start.

35:19.159 --> 35:22.117
That was pretty standard, actually.
Yeah, Jerry's extreme.

35:22.287 --> 35:25.075
The masturbation was fake,
but the pleasure was real.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.865
I mean, I've said it before,
but we're not gonna tag him because,

35:28.418 --> 35:30.750
you know, he's better at tag
than us.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.831
I'm obviously going to be the one
that tags Jerry.

35:33.006 --> 35:36.249
I've been working
with this Japanese guy. Sensei.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.918
He knows zero karate.

35:39.095 --> 35:41.803
Oh, he doesn't know karate.
He's claiming to know karate?

35:43.767 --> 35:45.383
He doesn't know karate.
I don't think he knows karate.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.598
Well, then what does he call it when
I roundhouse kicked him in 10th grade?

35:48.772 --> 35:51.059
Callahan and Chilli did get in a
huge fight sophomore year of high school

35:51.232 --> 35:56.102
and Callahan did just tag Chilli
with a beautiful roundhouse kick.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.817
But in Chilli's defense, when Callahan
kicked him...

35:59.991 --> 36:01.231
He shit in his pants!

36:01.409 --> 36:03.150
Yeah, okay, that never happened.

36:03.328 --> 36:06.411
And it's nice to actually get
an opportunity to address it directly.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.742
By all means. I'm all ears.

36:07.916 --> 36:11.250
I mean, I was very sweaty.
It was warm out.

36:11.461 --> 36:15.500
The sweaty ass defense?
He's been banging that drum for years.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.585
Hottest October on record, if I recall.
Look it up.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.170
<i>Wall</i> Street Journal,
you have fact checkers

36:19.260 --> 36:20.716
for this exact scenario, right?

36:20.804 --> 36:22.761
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.804
While you're at it,
can you have the fact checkers look into

36:24.974 --> 36:27.887
if The Maury <i>Povich</i> Show is staged?
'Cause it feels staged,

36:28.061 --> 36:30.018
but he swears it's not staged.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.725
But they do the exact same thing
every time.

36:33.608 --> 36:34.939
What?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.188
Ah!

36:49.457 --> 36:53.826
Sable, I know where
Jerry's gonna be. I need the tag.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.999
<i>Okay.</i>

36:57.465 --> 37:00.583
Yeah. Just picked up the tux.

37:00.760 --> 37:01.966
All right, see you soon, babe.

37:03.304 --> 37:05.295
Hey, Rob, how're you doing, bud?
Good to see you.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.679
You, too, man.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.807
Gloria, ma'am.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.183
- My balloon!
- Whoa!

37:10.979 --> 37:12.970
Hey, this must be yours, buddy.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.138
Thanks, mister.

37:14.315 --> 37:15.396
Oh, look at that.
You gonna eat that whole thing?

37:16.276 --> 37:18.358
You know what? You should consider
some alternative snacks.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.694
Keeping fitness fun, buddy.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.245
Oh. Excuse me, ma'am.

37:30.415 --> 37:32.281
You dropped your...

37:33.793 --> 37:35.409
<i>Men's athletic crossover-style boot,</i>

37:35.587 --> 37:37.123
<i>size nine and a half.</i>

37:37.630 --> 37:39.462
<i>Suggests a man
that is neither fashionable</i>

37:40.008 --> 37:41.419
<i>nor athletic.</i>

37:41.593 --> 37:42.583
Hoagie.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.140
<i>. Little does Hoagie know</i>

37:54.314 --> 37:57.022
<i>I've been teaching a women's
self-defense boot camp for six years.</i>

37:57.942 --> 37:59.148
<i>First defense 101.</i>

37:59.319 --> 38:00.605
<i>Class is in session.</i>

38:10.830 --> 38:11.945
Holy shit!

38:38.983 --> 38:39.973
Hmm.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.491
- You're done, Hoagie.
- Never!

38:53.665 --> 38:54.655
You're done.

38:54.833 --> 38:55.823
Never!

38:58.127 --> 39:00.084
All right, I'm done.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.913
Dude, you look amazing, by the way.
You've really upped your game!

39:03.091 --> 39:04.752
How'd you know I was gonna be here?

39:04.843 --> 39:06.425
Aha! Surprised you, right?

39:07.053 --> 39:08.839
<i>I saw the pick-up ticket for your tailor</i>

39:08.930 --> 39:10.011
<i>when we broke into your house
the other night.</i>

39:13.017 --> 39:14.007
Impressive.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.471
I'm taking you down, Jerry.

39:15.645 --> 39:17.511
Well, we both know
that's never gonna happen.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.646
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Coming through. Excuse me.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.932
Oh, boy. Cavalry's coming in.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.521
Hey, Jerry.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.106
This old lady bothering you?

39:25.280 --> 39:27.692
I'm good, Marvin. Thanks, man.
Everything's all right.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.072
It's just a friend of mine.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.448
Hey, it's good to see you.
Looking good, brother.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.614
- My man.
- Yeah, staying in shape.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.950
What the fuck?

39:36.124 --> 39:38.240
All right, well, maybe
I'll call the police. All right?

39:38.418 --> 39:40.375
This is assault.
You willing to go to jail for this?

39:40.962 --> 39:42.623
Oh, you're goddamn right, lam.

39:43.298 --> 39:48.384
Okay, then maybe I will cause
a big scene and get arrested also.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.045
Then, once we both get to jail,
I'll just...

39:51.222 --> 39:52.337
What? Bribe a guard?

39:52.432 --> 39:54.924
Be put in my cell? Yeah, I figured
you'd say that. It's pretty obvious.

39:55.101 --> 39:57.138
Hoag, you have to realize
that's gonna take hours,

39:57.312 --> 39:58.552
during which time

39:58.730 --> 40:00.437
I'll have fashioned
a shiv from my toothbrush

40:00.523 --> 40:01.934
and used it to murder my cellmate.

40:02.108 --> 40:03.223
You'd just shiv your cellmate?

40:03.401 --> 40:05.859
Don't worry. He's a bad person
who's done terrible things,

40:06.029 --> 40:07.019
so justice is served.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.270
<i>Okay.</i>

40:08.364 --> 40:10.321
It gets me thrown in solitary
confinement, which is what I want.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.658
Out of reach. Completely untaggable.

40:13.828 --> 40:15.284
Damn, you have thought this through.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.121
Pretty good, right?

40:18.499 --> 40:20.160
Look, understand two things, Hoagie.

40:21.252 --> 40:23.038
First, you're not gonna screw up
this wedding. Okay?

40:23.212 --> 40:26.204
And secondly,
I will never let you tag me.

40:26.382 --> 40:28.589
You're gonna die before that ever
happens. You understand that, right?

40:28.760 --> 40:32.298
I don't fear death, Jerry.
And I'm not gonna give this up

40:32.472 --> 40:33.587
till I die.

40:34.057 --> 40:36.298
Okay. Good luck.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.893
See you at the rehearsal, Jerry.

40:53.326 --> 40:56.535
Mmm! These hushpuppies are insane.

40:56.621 --> 40:57.611
All right, listen.

40:57.705 --> 41:01.949
T-minus 34 minutes until this rehearsal
dinner is over, and Jerry's fair game.

41:02.043 --> 41:04.751
There's four of us. There's four exits.
Let's fan out and trap this rat.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.161
Okay? Synchronize your watches.

41:06.339 --> 41:08.125
- I don't know how to do that.
- I don't wear a watch.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.165
Time is a construct.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.926
Okay, uh, 5:00.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.712
Could have said that at the beginning.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.254
Well, we said it now.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.924
-5:00, how hard is that?
-5:00, yeah, it's easy.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.059
- Hi, guys. How are you?
- How are you?

41:21.229 --> 41:22.594
Sorry about the other night.
That wasn't...

41:22.772 --> 41:23.887
- Oh!
- Yeah, that wasn't cool.

41:24.065 --> 41:26.181
No. I mean, listen,
I know it's not just you guys.

41:26.359 --> 41:28.396
I mean, Jerry's worse than all of you.

41:28.569 --> 41:30.151
He's very competitive.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.527
When we were kids, we had a contest

41:31.698 --> 41:34.190
to see who could hold their breath
for the longest underwater.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.362
He almost died.

41:36.452 --> 41:39.194
He won, but at what cost? Really?

41:39.288 --> 41:43.373
Oh, I hope he's this competitive
when it comes to being a father.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.450
Are you pregnant?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.161
- Really?
- Yeah, that's why the Shirley Temple.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.625
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know.

41:49.799 --> 41:51.085
- Here, cheers!
- Congratulations, that's great!

41:51.259 --> 41:52.374
- Cheers, thank you!
- Oh, my gosh!

41:52.552 --> 41:53.838
- That's such good news.
- Thank you. Yeah.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.878
- We're not telling that many people.
- Okay.

41:56.055 --> 41:58.012
Listen, I know
it's gonna get a little wacky

41:58.182 --> 41:59.672
over the next couple of days
with you guys.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.512
- Sure the fuck is, yeah.
- Okay.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.094
Just don't go too far

42:04.188 --> 42:07.476
and go out there and play golf.
It's amazing. Do something fun.

42:07.567 --> 42:10.059
- Okay? Okay. Bye, guys.
- See you.

42:10.153 --> 42:12.520
I like her.
She has a beautiful personality.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.563
Very effervescent. Good energy.
Good vibes.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.155
Ah, don't believe a word
she fucking says.

42:16.325 --> 42:17.611
She's a hired hand. She's an actress.

42:17.827 --> 42:19.613
- What?
- I mean, look at this son of a bitch.

42:19.787 --> 42:21.653
- This is Colonel Sanders in the flesh.
- That's, like, her uncle.

42:21.831 --> 42:23.868
- It's the fucking Truman Show.
- Will you stop?

42:23.958 --> 42:26.290
The whole thing. Jerry set it up.
I guarantee it.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.118
Every single person here has been hired.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.577
You have gotta calm down.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.664
Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm his wife.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.092
Jerry, is that Cheryl Deakins?

42:41.934 --> 42:43.220
Oh, yeah. Good. Hey!

42:43.770 --> 42:44.931
- You invited her?
- Yeah, of course.

42:45.104 --> 42:46.094
What?

42:46.272 --> 42:47.979
What? We're all old friends.

42:48.649 --> 42:49.639
Makes sense.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.023
I'm not buying this.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.228
Is that, uh...

42:55.406 --> 42:57.022
Cheryl Deakins.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.235
You know she was coming, Bob?

42:58.576 --> 43:00.408
- I did not.
- I didn't either.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.568
She looks good.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.328
- Great. She always does.
- Yeah.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.322
Wow!

43:05.500 --> 43:07.616
Uh, who is Cheryl Deakins?

43:07.794 --> 43:10.627
Is she like the Yoko or something?

43:10.797 --> 43:12.333
I don't get that reference,

43:12.507 --> 43:15.340
but she's someone whose presence
causes strain on our group.

43:15.885 --> 43:17.592
We've known her since grade school.

43:19.263 --> 43:22.597
<i>She was the first girl that Chilli
and Callahan had a crush on.</i>

43:23.226 --> 43:25.888
<i>When we were kids,
Cheryl was into Chilli,</i>

43:26.187 --> 43:28.679
<i>much to Callahan's chagrin.</i>

43:28.856 --> 43:31.063
<i>But young love is unpredictable.</i>

43:31.234 --> 43:34.192
<i>Later that same year, she decided
she was into Callahan,</i>

43:34.487 --> 43:36.774
<i>much to Chilli's chagrin.</i>

43:37.490 --> 43:40.699
<i>But she always had
a place in her heart for Chilli.</i>

43:49.127 --> 43:50.788
And this went on for decades.

43:50.962 --> 43:53.124
And all of a sudden,
she just married an orthodontist.

43:53.214 --> 43:54.204
Huh.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.581
They get all the chicks.

43:56.676 --> 43:57.666
What?

43:57.760 --> 43:59.216
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

43:59.387 --> 44:01.128
About 10 years for me. How about you?

44:01.764 --> 44:02.970
Same, I guess.

44:04.433 --> 44:05.889
- Been a while.
- Sure has.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.809
You sneaky trickster.

44:07.979 --> 44:10.767
She looks amazing, and you know it.
Think about this.

44:10.940 --> 44:14.308
What if Cheryl ended up getting back
together with our boy?

44:14.485 --> 44:15.771
- Chilli?
- Callahan?

44:15.945 --> 44:17.060
Obviously.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.361
- Wait. What?
- Duh.

44:18.531 --> 44:19.942
- Did you say Chilli?
- You're Team Callahan?

44:20.116 --> 44:21.982
- Yeah!
- We've been married all this time,

44:22.160 --> 44:23.491
and you think she should end up
with Callahan?

44:23.661 --> 44:25.993
Of course. Wait, you think Chilli?

44:26.164 --> 44:28.622
Wait, do you know those guys at all?

44:28.916 --> 44:30.202
Who are you right now?

44:30.293 --> 44:31.283
- What?
- You're freaking me out.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.367
I feel like I don't even know you.

44:32.503 --> 44:33.914
You're like this foreign person.

44:36.549 --> 44:38.210
Do you want me to be a foreign person?

44:38.759 --> 44:39.749
What?

44:40.595 --> 44:41.960
Here? Right now?

44:42.054 --> 44:43.465
Because, um...

44:43.556 --> 44:45.593
<i>I just got</i> lost
<i>on the way to bibliothéque,</i>

44:45.766 --> 44:47.973
and I don't know
where all my other French friends are.

44:48.144 --> 44:49.179
Chantelle is here?

44:49.353 --> 44:50.559
Chantelle is here with...

44:50.730 --> 44:51.720
Oh, my God!

44:55.067 --> 44:56.808
Honey, it's almost 5:00.

44:57.653 --> 44:59.189
Keep your head in the game.

44:59.363 --> 45:00.353
You're so good.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.942
Come on, we'll go to the bathroom
for five minutes.

45:02.116 --> 45:03.106
All right.

45:03.284 --> 45:04.524
- It's crazy.
- Huh.

45:04.702 --> 45:06.693
- Hey, you should go talk with her.
- No, you should go.

45:06.871 --> 45:07.952
Neither of you should.

45:08.664 --> 45:10.371
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Neither one.

45:10.625 --> 45:11.911
Shut up, Sable.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.366
No, honestly, it should be you, Bob.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.080
No, I think she really
wants to talk to you

45:15.171 --> 45:18.084
'cause I think girls really like,
you know,

45:18.257 --> 45:21.420
depressed guys that still have a name
for their bong.

45:25.556 --> 45:26.717
Get a good one.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.721
This is gonna go great.

45:31.604 --> 45:32.685
Thank you.

45:32.855 --> 45:34.562
All right, good advice.

45:36.192 --> 45:37.182
Good luck.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.185
Tell her I said hi.

45:44.533 --> 45:45.523
Cheryl Deakins.

45:46.244 --> 45:47.700
Chilli Cilliano.

45:48.037 --> 45:49.198
How'd you know it was me?

45:49.372 --> 45:52.205
I'd know that faint smell of sativa
and Old Spice anywhere.

45:52.375 --> 45:54.116
Yeah. I had to get a little stoned.

45:54.293 --> 45:56.204
I can't be sober at these things.
They're awful.

45:57.380 --> 45:58.916
That was the wrong choice, man.

45:59.298 --> 46:00.288
What?

46:00.466 --> 46:04.460
Neither of you should have gone,
but if one of you should have went,

46:04.637 --> 46:05.968
then it should have been you.

46:06.347 --> 46:07.633
How many wines have you had?

46:09.350 --> 46:11.842
How many legs does an octopus have?

46:12.770 --> 46:13.805
Well, eight.

46:16.607 --> 46:19.975
I see that you've been
rejecting fashion trends

46:20.152 --> 46:22.940
and haircuts and maybe hygiene.
I respect that.

46:23.114 --> 46:27.574
Well, I think respect is the key to the
beginning of rebuilding a friendship.

46:27.702 --> 46:29.943
- Is that a saying? Maybe?
- Yeah, sure. Who said that?

46:30.121 --> 46:33.284
I don't know. I wanna hear
about this husband of yours.

46:34.292 --> 46:38.160
What's the story?
Is he still charming, sensible, rich?

46:38.713 --> 46:40.499
No. Dead.

46:40.965 --> 46:42.751
Yeah, same with me.

46:42.925 --> 46:44.711
Dead to me. Divorced.

46:45.636 --> 46:49.470
No, I mean he's "dead" dead.
He actually died.

46:49.932 --> 46:51.013
He's dead?

46:51.934 --> 46:53.095
For real?

46:53.519 --> 46:54.600
Oh...

46:54.687 --> 46:56.849
Yeah, he, um...

46:56.939 --> 46:59.476
He died in a car crash.
We were separated already.

46:59.567 --> 47:00.932
Oh, you already separated.

47:01.277 --> 47:02.893
- Yeah.
- And now he's dead. He's gone.

47:03.070 --> 47:04.151
- He's gone.
- Officially.

47:04.322 --> 47:06.905
Act a little more upset about it.

47:07.074 --> 47:09.566
I know, but, anyway, how are you?
How's your life?

47:09.702 --> 47:13.912
Great. I lost my business. Divorced.
Playing tag competitively.

47:14.081 --> 47:15.116
Pretty much rock bottom.

47:15.291 --> 47:17.578
- Are you trying to make me horny?
- Fuck yes, lam.

47:17.668 --> 47:19.033
-'Cause it's happening.
- It is?

47:19.128 --> 47:21.210
Oh, yeah.

47:22.465 --> 47:23.955
So have you tried the hushpuppies,
or what?

47:24.050 --> 47:25.415
What do you think they're talking about?

47:27.303 --> 47:29.419
I don't know, and I don't want
you to worry about it.

47:29.597 --> 47:30.712
We've got 15 minutes.

47:30.890 --> 47:35.305
Oh, Chilli, I think about you
all the time, Chilli.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.932
Oh, yeah? But what about
Callahan? He's so handsome.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.347
He's very handsome,
but he's a selfish lover

47:41.525 --> 47:42.811
with a small dick.

47:43.069 --> 47:44.059
Really?

47:44.153 --> 47:45.484
Plus he sobs after he comes.

47:45.654 --> 47:47.019
Okay.

47:47.239 --> 47:48.229
Wow.

47:48.407 --> 47:50.899
It's okay, Callahan.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.609
Okay, you know what?
You guys are all 12-year-olds.

47:52.703 --> 47:53.693
Oh, Chilli.

47:53.788 --> 47:56.450
Hey, Cheryl, I want to reconnect.

47:56.791 --> 48:00.079
Oh, yeah.

48:00.169 --> 48:01.659
- What's happening now?
- Oh, Bob!

48:01.837 --> 48:04.920
Yeah, I'm just...
Oh, I'm just feeling the vibes.

48:05.049 --> 48:08.462
I mean, who wants to have sex
with a guy named Bob?

48:08.636 --> 48:11.594
"Oh, Bob." Just doesn't sound right.
"Oh, Bob."

48:11.764 --> 48:12.970
-"Oh, Bob."
-"on, Bob."

48:13.140 --> 48:15.222
-"Bob. Bob, Bob."
-"Oh, Robert."

48:15.309 --> 48:16.390
"Bob."

48:16.560 --> 48:17.925
I wasn't gonna text you, you know?

48:18.104 --> 48:19.390
I didn't wanna mess with you
when you were married.

48:19.563 --> 48:21.145
No, I think that's nice. Respectful.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.601
If I knew he was dead,
I would have texted right away.

48:22.775 --> 48:23.765
All right. Okay.

48:23.943 --> 48:26.355
- No! Please don't leave on that!
- No, it's fine.

48:26.529 --> 48:28.361
We're good. We're good.
I'm just gonna use the ladies' room.

48:28.489 --> 48:29.479
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

48:29.573 --> 48:30.563
- It's nice to see you.
- It's great to see you.

48:30.783 --> 48:31.773
You too.

48:36.038 --> 48:37.028
Widowed.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.093
Cheryl Deakins.

48:56.642 --> 48:58.007
What are you doing here?

48:58.185 --> 48:59.175
And where are the urinals?

48:59.728 --> 49:00.968
Probably in the men's room.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.222
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Thank you.

49:04.400 --> 49:05.731
No, that was not a compliment.

49:05.901 --> 49:07.767
Well, I have matured.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.276
Have you? Really?

49:09.447 --> 49:11.859
Because this old move where you
follow me into the bathroom,

49:12.032 --> 49:13.443
it's exactly what you did
at junior prom.

49:13.617 --> 49:15.949
It was a good move then,
and it's a good move now.

49:16.370 --> 49:17.701
- Marginally nicer bathroom.
- Mmm.

49:18.497 --> 49:19.487
Do you wanna get a drink?

49:19.582 --> 49:21.118
Uh, actually, I think
I'm gonna head home.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.373
Can I give you a ride?

49:23.002 --> 49:24.367
- Sure.
- Great.

49:24.795 --> 49:25.876
Right after we have that drink.

49:26.046 --> 49:27.502
Oh, I see what you did there.

49:31.719 --> 49:35.132
Okay, guys. It's almost go time.
ls everybody in position? Over.

49:35.514 --> 49:37.425
Sable is in position.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.975
<i>- Chilli!</i>
- Yeah. Let's get him.

49:41.145 --> 49:44.228
<i>HOAGIE". Callahan. Callahan,
do you read me? Over.</i>

49:46.275 --> 49:48.516
Callahan. Where are you, buddy?

49:51.489 --> 49:52.900
Callahan!

49:53.073 --> 49:55.280
We got an unguarded exit, okay?

49:55.951 --> 49:56.941
Hi.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.239
Callahan!

50:06.212 --> 50:07.373
Go! Go! Go! Go!

50:07.463 --> 50:08.453
Go!

50:08.631 --> 50:10.167
Not today, motherfucker!

50:12.426 --> 50:14.087
Hey, thanks for coming. Appreciate it.

50:19.391 --> 50:20.472
GO! Go!

50:20.643 --> 50:22.884
Come and get it, bitches!

50:24.730 --> 50:26.471
- Get in! Get in!
- We're close. We're close.

50:26.649 --> 50:28.014
Go!

50:42.331 --> 50:43.696
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Go, go!

50:45.292 --> 50:47.249
Go faster! Go faster!

50:47.336 --> 50:48.701
Giddy up!

50:49.797 --> 50:51.083
We're coming for you!

50:52.841 --> 50:54.832
Go, Hoagie, go!

51:00.516 --> 51:01.506
<i>Jesus!</i>

51:03.894 --> 51:04.975
Incoming!

51:06.564 --> 51:07.679
- Son of a bitch!
- Come on!

51:07.773 --> 51:09.229
Go! Go!

51:10.651 --> 51:12.016
God, I wish I had my gun here.

51:12.194 --> 51:14.310
There are so many good birds to shoot.

51:15.948 --> 51:17.279
So this is a vacation for you?

51:17.449 --> 51:21.408
Yeah. I mean, some couples go
on cruises. Some couples go camping.

51:21.579 --> 51:25.368
Some couples go to strip clubs
and have gangbangs,

51:25.541 --> 51:27.282
and this is just what we do.
This is what we love.

51:27.459 --> 51:28.870
This is our gangbang.

51:29.712 --> 51:32.044
You know, it seems to me like
you'd be really good at the game.

51:32.214 --> 51:33.204
- Why don't you play?
- Well,

51:33.382 --> 51:36.340
they came up with the rules
when they were nine. No girls allowed.

51:36.844 --> 51:39.677
And to be honest, I can get a little

51:39.763 --> 51:42.596
overly aggressive
and competitive sometimes.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.427
Come on, Jerry.
You're dead meat!

51:44.643 --> 51:46.259
Yeah, kick his ass!

51:46.437 --> 51:48.144
Keep your eyes downfield!

51:48.314 --> 51:49.770
Cut across the fourth fairway!

51:49.940 --> 51:51.772
Don't fuck this up!

51:52.026 --> 51:53.608
Yeah. Well.

51:54.987 --> 51:57.524
Oh, I have to show you
pictures of our kids.

51:59.742 --> 52:00.903
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

52:02.870 --> 52:03.905
Get him, Hoagie. Get him!

52:04.079 --> 52:05.240
Hold on. Hold on.

52:06.248 --> 52:08.205
Hoagie, stop!

52:09.084 --> 52:11.542
- Hoagie, what are you doing?
- I can't see!

52:20.471 --> 52:23.179
Ahh! Whoo!

52:24.933 --> 52:25.923
Everybody good?

52:26.018 --> 52:28.555
I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:30.522 --> 52:31.762
Well, that happened.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.393
Onward.

52:34.902 --> 52:35.892
Let's get him.

52:35.986 --> 52:37.226
Whoo! That was invigorating.

52:47.331 --> 52:50.039
On.

52:50.209 --> 52:53.292
That is psychological warfare
right there.

52:54.046 --> 52:55.036
That's impressive.

52:55.214 --> 52:56.249
Yeah, that's a good move.

52:56.423 --> 52:57.788
<i>Good one, Jen!</i>

53:01.553 --> 53:02.543
There he is!

53:04.181 --> 53:05.421
Hello, boys.

53:08.143 --> 53:09.929
What?

53:10.521 --> 53:11.511
What the...

53:11.605 --> 53:12.891
How's he doing this?

53:13.065 --> 53:14.146
All right, Jerry, stop!

53:14.316 --> 53:15.556
He's multiplying!
It's happening!

53:15.734 --> 53:16.724
- What the fuck?
- There's one!

53:18.821 --> 53:19.811
One is there!

53:19.988 --> 53:21.103
- Hey!
- What?

53:21.490 --> 53:22.901
You guys, there's so many.
There's so many!

53:23.075 --> 53:24.065
What the...

53:24.493 --> 53:26.484
There he is! I'm coming for you, Jerry!

53:26.578 --> 53:27.693
Chilli, you're not even it!

53:35.921 --> 53:37.377
I'm on your <i>ass!</i>

53:39.466 --> 53:40.456
Come on!

53:49.893 --> 53:51.679
Oh, shit!

53:52.271 --> 53:53.386
Shit!

54:01.321 --> 54:04.029
This is terrible. This is pure bullshit.

54:04.199 --> 54:05.189
We should not be here.

54:05.325 --> 54:07.783
This is getting way too extreme.

54:07.870 --> 54:09.611
I need you to buck up, Sable.

54:09.788 --> 54:11.028
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's stay focused.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.785
Yeah, we bucked up
out of the goddamn golf cart.

54:18.547 --> 54:20.288
You smell that?
Do you smell it?

54:20.466 --> 54:21.752
It's Jerry. I smell him.

54:21.925 --> 54:23.006
It's leaves and grass.

54:23.969 --> 54:25.084
And centipedes.

54:25.721 --> 54:26.961
Just typical woods stuff.

54:27.598 --> 54:29.430
He's close.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.761
I can feel it.

54:30.934 --> 54:32.140
I can feel something.

54:33.812 --> 54:34.847
Oh, shit!

54:37.524 --> 54:39.265
- Jesus! Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

54:39.443 --> 54:41.434
- Oh my, God!
- Wow, that's crazy.

54:42.654 --> 54:45.271
Our friend is a psychopath,
and this is scary.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.282
He got me. I'm down.

54:48.744 --> 54:51.076
This is on you now. Come here.

54:51.872 --> 54:52.907
Let me tag you.

54:53.707 --> 54:55.289
Come on!

54:55.959 --> 54:56.949
All right.

54:58.337 --> 54:59.327
I can see him.

54:59.505 --> 55:02.839
He's at three o'clock. 50 yards out.

55:03.008 --> 55:04.749
- Three o'clock. Got it.
- Three o'clock.

55:06.678 --> 55:07.713
Sable!

55:10.724 --> 55:12.089
That three o'clock.

55:12.267 --> 55:14.224
- You didn't say which time zone, man!
- There's no time zones.

55:14.394 --> 55:16.601
Why didn't you just point
the first time? Next time, just point.

55:16.772 --> 55:17.933
It's that way. Go!

55:18.106 --> 55:19.096
- Okay.
- GO, go:

55:19.608 --> 55:20.598
Go, Sable, go!

55:44.508 --> 55:46.499
I see you.

55:48.387 --> 55:50.048
Yeah, motherfucker.

55:55.269 --> 55:56.259
You're it!

56:08.657 --> 56:09.863
Oh, I don't like that.

56:17.291 --> 56:18.281
Sleep.

56:23.881 --> 56:24.871
Sable?

56:25.966 --> 56:27.206
Sable?

56:41.690 --> 56:43.021
What happened?

56:43.108 --> 56:44.314
Well, you got chloroformed.

56:44.401 --> 56:46.017
Chloroformed? What?

56:46.111 --> 56:47.897
Bob took our car,
and now we're in a Lyft.

56:47.988 --> 56:49.103
We're going to the Sandpiper.

56:49.698 --> 56:50.688
I don't wanna be it anymore.

56:50.866 --> 56:52.982
I don't wanna be it.
Hoagie, it's on you, bud.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.066
Now, what the fuck?

56:54.161 --> 56:56.402
Wait. I'm confused.
What just happened in there?

56:56.580 --> 56:59.117
Well, Jerry woke up early,
got some grounds crew

56:59.291 --> 57:02.249
to go out in the woods, build some
snares and a swinging log trap,

57:02.419 --> 57:04.956
and, uh, wear matching outfits
to act as decoys.

57:05.339 --> 57:06.329
Maniac.

57:09.092 --> 57:10.127
Are you okay?

57:10.218 --> 57:13.301
Yes, yes. I am. I am... I'm good.

57:13.805 --> 57:16.467
I am amazed that you're able to stay
so optimistic after all that.

57:16.642 --> 57:19.134
Well, some have said
I am the heart and soul of the game.

57:19.311 --> 57:20.517
No, you've said that.

57:20.687 --> 57:22.052
You're the only person
I've heard say that.

57:22.230 --> 57:25.973
Well, technically "just me"
fits the legal definition of "some,"

57:26.151 --> 57:27.767
so suck a dick.

57:29.446 --> 57:32.404
Well, it seems like the game
has really kept you guys connected.

57:32.574 --> 57:34.156
- Exactly.
- Well, except Jerry.

57:34.326 --> 57:35.691
What? Don't say that.

57:35.869 --> 57:37.359
How often do you see Jerry
outside of tag?

57:37.454 --> 57:40.367
Hmm... Well, not super frequently, but--

57:40.540 --> 57:43.077
I mean, would you consider that
a close friendship?

57:45.796 --> 57:47.833
Well, that's kind of a dicky question.

57:57.265 --> 57:58.300
Thank you.

57:59.893 --> 58:03.761
All I'm saying is,
Callahan better fucking be here.

58:10.112 --> 58:11.102
What's up? What?

58:11.279 --> 58:12.485
Look who decided to show up.

58:12.656 --> 58:13.987
What? I had a business call
with Beijing.

58:14.074 --> 58:15.064
Couldn't be helped. I'm sorry.

58:15.200 --> 58:17.783
Business call with Beijing? It would
have been 8:00 a.m. Saturday out there.

58:17.953 --> 58:19.944
You doing business calls
at 8:00 a.m. Saturday morning?

58:20.122 --> 58:21.738
Why do you know so much
about Beijing time zones?

58:21.915 --> 58:24.748
2008 Olympics. Michael Phelps, baby.

58:25.752 --> 58:27.538
Fair enough.
Okay, anyway, I have an idea.

58:27.713 --> 58:28.874
- Anybody want to hear it?
- Yes.

58:29.047 --> 58:30.913
- What is it?
- Jerry's gym.

58:31.383 --> 58:32.919
Someone there's gotta know where he is.

58:33.093 --> 58:35.209
- I like this. That's a good idea.
- Great!

58:35.387 --> 58:37.219
- Up top! Buckle up, gang!
- Yes! Giddy up!

58:37.389 --> 58:38.754
- You're it, by the way.
- What's wrong?

58:38.932 --> 58:40.593
- My fucking knee.
- What's wrong with your knee?

58:40.767 --> 58:41.757
I got hit by a log.

58:41.852 --> 58:42.933
You got hit by a log, what?

58:43.020 --> 58:45.057
We were chasing him. I got hit
by a fucking log. It really hurts.

58:45.147 --> 58:47.514
I'm gonna go in. Fuck, I'm pissed off
about this, but go.

58:47.607 --> 58:48.938
You want me to call the pediatrician?

58:49.067 --> 58:50.432
I'm an adult.
I don't need a pediatrician.

58:50.527 --> 58:51.517
You're not coming?

58:51.611 --> 58:53.648
I think I'm gonna slow you down.
Why don't you guys go?

58:53.822 --> 58:54.983
After the gym, let's meet up.

58:55.157 --> 58:56.147
All right, fine.

58:56.324 --> 58:57.314
Trust me, I wanna go, but I just--

58:57.492 --> 59:00.109
Y'all need a sub? Huh? I'm in!

59:00.287 --> 59:01.823
We're super good, man. Thanks!

59:01.913 --> 59:03.654
We're good.

59:03.832 --> 59:06.073
Who's banned now, bitch?

59:06.668 --> 59:10.127
I'm okay.
All right, guys. Take it easy!

59:10.213 --> 59:11.294
Phew.

59:21.683 --> 59:23.469
Oh, that knee healed up fast.

59:23.643 --> 59:25.259
Stay out of this, Lou.

59:29.524 --> 59:31.481
Oh, you saucy devil.

59:42.496 --> 59:45.864
Hey, there, welcome to Granite Fitness.
Get hard, stay hard.

59:46.041 --> 59:48.999
Just so you guys know, we're going
to be closing in five short minutes,

59:49.169 --> 59:51.160
but is there anything
I can help you with?

59:51.379 --> 59:53.495
Yes, Dave, in fact, there is something
you could help us with.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.914
How would you like to earn $500?

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:06.179
Okay, just so you guys know, I'm not
sucking your guys' dicks, all right?

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.969
And I'm not letting you
suck my dick either.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:11.104
No one is talking about anyone
sucking anyone's anything.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.266
You sure about that?
'Cause this guy's eyeing me hard.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:15.643
What?

01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:17.061
I'm just saying, man,
you've got that vibe.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.737
- Yeah?
- Stop it.

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:20.238
Hey, Sable, seriously. Chill.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:21.569
- Just stop it.
- Stop it.

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:25.449
It's too sexual. You're undressing me,
literally, right now with your eyes.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:31.501
Dave. 500 bucks, and all we want
is to know where Jerry is.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:33.039
Oh!

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:36.418
Jerry. Yes, okay, shit.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:39.796
He did mention that some people
were gonna swing by looking for him.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:42.761
He left a message. Um, oh, yeah.

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:44.387
Go fuck yourselves.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.841
Okay, look. $1,000.
All right? Easy money.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.133
Jerry won't even know
that you sold him out.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.177
I got a better idea.
Why don't you go back

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.687
to the little Best Western
that you're staying in

01:00:52.858 --> 01:00:54.940
and jerk each other off in the nude?

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.272
Why do you keep taking this conversation
into a sexual direction?

01:00:57.445 --> 01:01:00.528
Listen, Dave. $1,500. Don't be an idiot.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.861
Not a chance,
you dick-sucking homophobes.

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.237
- Hey!
- What?

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.484
Dave?

01:01:06.621 --> 01:01:07.782
Do you know what we're gonna do?

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:08.946
What?

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.953
We're gonna waterboard you.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.589
Don't be a hero, Dave.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.383
Jerry doesn't give a shit about you.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.102
So tell us where he is.

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:33.895
I'm never gonna tell you.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:35.976
Last chance, Dave.

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:41.187
You're not gonna go through with this
for some game, so quit jerking me off!

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:44.064
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:45.778
No one's jerking you off, kid,

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.659
'cause Jerry has pushed us
to the fucking edge.

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:49.911
If you don't tell us
what we need to know,

01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.614
you're going over the edge with us.

01:01:51.791 --> 01:01:52.906
You ready to die for this shit?

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:55.200
I'd rather die than get sucked off
by you homophobes.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.245
We're not gonna suck you off.
We're gonna waterboard you.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.289
I'm just taking
a principled stand right now.

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:02.708
Okay. Well, guess what.
Now, this is gonna happen. All right?

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.627
Are you ready?
I hope you can hold your breath, son!

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:05.711
Do it!

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.512
'Cause this is going right down!

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.593
- Yeah!
- Yeah! You son of a bitch!

01:02:09.768 --> 01:02:10.849
Here it comes!

01:02:11.019 --> 01:02:12.180
It's coming!
It's coming! It's coming!

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.140
Yeah. You know, we should not.

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:16.476
I feel like it would be way too much.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:17.685
Phew. That got out of hand.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:19.520
My heart is beating
really fast right now.

01:02:19.694 --> 01:02:21.776
We were just Kidding.
We were just bluffing.

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:24.530
- No, we weren't fucking bluffing!
- Anna, Anna, Anna!

01:02:24.699 --> 01:02:26.815
- Oh, my God, no. Just, no.
- Sweetheart.

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:29.826
It's a war crime, right?
It's not really who we are.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:30.986
Yes, sorry.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:33.030
We got a kinky cat over here.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:34.786
- Okay.
- Fuck you, Dave.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.792
God, I love your passion.

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.578
I'll tell you what.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:43.465
I will tell you where Jerry's gonna be

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:47.966
for $2,000. Cash. American.

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:49.129
- Okay, fine.
- No problem.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:50.638
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.345
Why did you take us
down this whole road?

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:54.180
Well, it looked like
there was room to negotiate,

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.386
and I was all prepared to do that.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:57.725
But then we went down
the whole torture track,

01:02:57.899 --> 01:03:00.982
and I just dug
my heels in, philosophically.

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:02.685
I happen to be an objector.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.191
- We are too, obviously.
- Not really.

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:06.355
It was a bluff.

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:08.023
You know what?
You should probably not write this down,

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:09.316
and if it does come up,

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:12.577
just mention that
we didn't actually waterboard him.

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:13.737
No waterboarding.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:16.122
Just a lot of talk about
sucking each other's dicks.

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:17.658
Yeah.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.001
Okay, look, you know what? Here.

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:26.213
I'm gonna give you $2,000,
and I'm gonna give you an extra $500.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.423
You just carry around that kind of cash
all day?

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:30.587
You were mentioning something
about Jerry, I think.

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:34.099
Yeah, uh, Jerry is in AA.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:36.806
- Wait, what?
- Yeah. Alcoholics Anonymous.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.971
I know what it stands for. Wait, did you
guys know anything about this?

01:03:39.357 --> 01:03:42.065
He goes there every morning
at a church on Brunswick.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.942
Looking back, I can kind of see it.

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:46.570
I mean, the first step is recognizing
you have a problem.

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:49.694
I'm just glad
he's getting the help he needs.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:51.988
Sorry, did you say
that church is on Brunswick?

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.152
- Yes.
- Okay!

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:54.619
- Let's go! Clean up the water!
- Thank you!

01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:56.120
So sorry.

01:03:57.584 --> 01:03:59.871
I told you this wasn't gonna be just
another boring corporate profile, right?

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.535
Right. This is definitely different.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:04.205
And I know I'm no longer
the center of the story,

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:06.498
which is fine with me.
I don't mind giving up the...

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:11.465
Bob, can I buy you a drink?

01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:13.346
Can you fucking believe this?
Hold on one second.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:15.299
- Maybe...
- One second, one second.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:17.309
Terrible experience.
So that we will never do it...

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:20.972
Hi! Hi! WOW! Look at this.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.184
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:23.520
Pretty good.
Yeah, we're just catching up.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.058
That's so nice. How's that knee?

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:26.977
- It actually does hurt.
- Yeah.

01:04:27.155 --> 01:04:29.772
But resting and talking to an old friend
has actually really helped.

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:31.110
Thank you for asking.

01:04:31.201 --> 01:04:32.691
Hey, how was the business call
with Beijing?

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:34.234
- Super good.
- It was?

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:36.240
- Yeah, I got a lot done.
- Great.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.368
Oh, what, you think I faked
my business call to Beijing

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.664
like you faked hurting your knee?

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.166
You know what, dude?
I'm sick of this shit, Bob.

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:43.919
- You're it. How about that?
- No! <i>Pass.</i>

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:45.875
- You can't pass. And you can't tag back.
- You're it. I pass.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.505
- Oh, my God.
- It's like literally the first rule.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.086
- You're it! You're it! You're it!
- You cannot tag me back!

01:04:49.177 --> 01:04:51.839
- I'll rewrite the fucking rule book!
- Shut up!

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:52.920
Why're you acting like children?

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:54.421
-'Cause he started it.
- You started it.

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:55.597
You literally started it.

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:56.718
- No, you started it!
-"Oh, my knee hurts."

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.845
What do you think they're talking about?

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.051
Are we off the record?

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.560
Yeah, sure, sure.

01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:02.683
No idea.

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:04.393
You know what?
I shouldn't have come.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.100
Jerry always gets in your head.

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:07.938
Did Jerry tell you to say that?

01:05:08.113 --> 01:05:09.649
You part of the whole
<i>Truman</i> Show of it all?

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:11.814
I mean, Jerry invited me
to the rehearsal dinner

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:14.574
because he thought it would distract
you guys, which it did.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:18.282
But, um, I wanted to see you. So I came.

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:19.408
Sure.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:20.489
Oh, my God.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.951
You guys are fucking idiots.
Both of you. But I love you both.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:26.207
I'm gonna go. Maybe I'll see you later.
Or not.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:29.544
- Cheryl...
- Go get Jerry. He fucking deserves it.

01:05:30.969 --> 01:05:32.209
Bye, Cheryl.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:34.257
Wow!

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.421
What do you want?

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:38.720
There's gonna be plenty of time
to get rejected by Cheryl

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.555
after 12:00 a.m. on June 1st.

01:05:41.729 --> 01:05:46.974
So what I need you guys to focus on,
is the fact that we're a team.

01:05:47.152 --> 01:05:50.486
Right? We love each other,
and we love this.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:54.569
Let's bask in that.
Stay focused on our mission. All right?

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.358
Let's get back on this horse and ride.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.992
Let's get this asshole.

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.325
Lou, not part of it. Not at all.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:01.704
Now, shake.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:03.782
Shake!

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:09.205
All right. Now we got some work to do.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:22.634
Got it.

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.644
Go get him, sweetie.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.111
<i>Okay.</i>

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:45.703
Hey, do you think we should talk
to Jerry about being an alcoholic

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.335
-before we get into all this?
- No.

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:55.300
But now, I've been clean and sober
for almost four years.

01:06:55.887 --> 01:06:59.471
Thanks to all of you
and that higher power. Amen?

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:01.757
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.928
Jerry, you about ready to share?

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:08.229
Come on, y'all,
let's give it up for Jerry.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.319
- My name is Jerry.
- Hi, Jerry.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:26.824
<i>. The slight scent of weed. Chilli.
He thinks he's caught me off guard.</i>

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:29.329
<i>Oh, my God!
I've caught him off guard.</i>

01:07:32.799 --> 01:07:34.506
<i>He rushes in from behind.</i>

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:37.463
<i>Idiot. I give him a wake-up call.</i>

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:47.265
<i>Hazelnut coffee?
What kind of bitch drinks hazelnut?</i>

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.815
Holy! Chilli! Hit me!

01:07:53.027 --> 01:07:54.017
Get him!

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:57.480
<i>I'm going to trap him
and tag him in the face,</i>

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:01.575
<i>and yet, in my heart of hearts,
pretty sure it's not gonna work.</i>

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:07.327
<i>Hoagie's attempts to face me fail
because he lacks confidence.</i>

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:10.242
<i>Also, I think it's fair to say,</i>

01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:14.296
<i>I'm fucking surgical
with these complimentary donuts.</i>

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:21.803
<i>And this is why
print journalism is dying.</i>

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:28.096
<i>BOB. Yes! This is the moment
I've been waiting for.</i>

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:30.638
<i>I'm going to be the one who tags Jerry.</i>

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:37.193
<i>. Callahan will become distracted
by his own arrogant thoughts,</i>

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:39.983
<i>which I will exploit.</i>

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:41.613
<i>BOB". This will be my victory,</i>

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.238
<i>which makes sense
because success breeds success...</i>

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.153
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:08:57.550 --> 01:09:02.545
How come "bi-weekly" means both
twice a <i>week and every <i>other</i> week?

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:06.555
<i>That's mad confusing
and it's just linguistically lazy.</i>

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:13.764
Oh, shit!

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.077
- Holy shit!
- Excessive.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.212
Feeling trapped, Jerry?

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:39.796
No.

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:40.957
Nice.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.170
Holy shit!

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:48.381
No, no, no!

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:52.180
No, no, no!

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:54.304
We got you, Jerry! You're trapped!

01:09:54.482 --> 01:09:57.474
Five hours till your wedding!
We can wait it out if you can!

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:15.917
Shit. You know what I just realized?

01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:18.328
There's a lot of sacramental wine
and wafers in there.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.667
He could survive for quite a while.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:21.002
No, he can't drink.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.257
- Yeah, but it's not real wine.
- Yes, it is.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:24.884
It's just grape juice. It's not wine.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:28.763
I mean, I was once so fucked up
that I took a shit in my niece's crib.

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:31.425
- Oh.
- Twice, if you ask my sister-in-law.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:33.593
So how long you been sober?

01:10:33.771 --> 01:10:35.887
Oh, no, I'm not sober.
I'm high right now.

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:37.393
I'm just here to tag my friend.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:41.731
Good luck with the sobriety, man.
That's cool. Definitely.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.815
It's awful quiet in there.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:46.026
You know what he's doing?
It's a classic ruse.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.908
Make them think there's an exit
and he already escaped. Not buying it.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.035
I buy it. I bet he has a secret door
back there.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:53.196
Refrigerator turns into an elevator.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.281
What?

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:56.537
Takes the elevator down to the basement.
That's his lair.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:58.334
- Different outfits, computer screens.
- What are you talking about?

01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.628
- Cameras watching us.
- He's not Batman.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.132
Told you. In there.

01:11:05.303 --> 01:11:06.384
What's it say?

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:10.840
-"Eat my dick."
-"Eat my dick." "Balls." "Ass"?

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:12.052
"Butt."

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.178
"Ice Cream."

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.259
- What?
- What?

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.804
Yeah, he's taunting me.
He knows I'm lactose intolerant.

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.891
What is going on? Where is he?

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:23.651
Where is he?

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.821
Jerry?

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:33.987
We're supposed to be getting
our wedding photos done in an hour.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.446
What are you doing?

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.332
- Come on out, Jerry.
- Jerry, you can come out.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:38.537
We're not gonna get you, Jerry.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.247
Babe, look, calm down.
Look, I'm sorry.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:42.583
Shut up, Jerry.
I can't fucking take this, Jerry.

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:44.122
She can't take it. Come on out.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.507
Honey, why are you playing this game
right now?

01:11:46.594 --> 01:11:48.710
Why are you playing this game
with your friends right now?

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.762
Why is he playing this game right now?

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:52.843
Hey, babe, look.
You gotta calm down, okay?

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:54.550
Listen to me! It's very hard

01:11:54.727 --> 01:11:57.890
because you have decided
to ruin everything.

01:11:58.064 --> 01:12:00.146
And so have you.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.274
With your stupid face,
and your stupid beard,

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:05.060
and your stupid glasses,

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:07.024
and that stupid jumpsuit.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:10.027
There's only so much
a girl can take,

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:12.909
and then you want me
on top of that, just to...

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:17.322
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.743
- Babe? Suz? Sue?
- Jerry. Oh, my God.

01:12:21.128 --> 01:12:22.710
- Boo? Boo-boo?
- Sue'?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.587
Boo-boo? Boo-boo?

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.168
What happened? Wait, wait, wait.
What happened?

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:27.332
Susan, are you okay?

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:29.342
- Sit down, sit down, sit down.
- It's the baby. It's the baby.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.469
It's finally happening. He's right here.
Who's it? Bob, tag him.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:32.800
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:33.964
There's something wrong with her baby.

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.848
There's nothing wrong with that baby.
It's a fake.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.508
If you won't do it, then tag me.
I'm gonna do it.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:39.519
Oh, yeah. Fine.
You want me to tag you, then?

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:40.975
Oops, I missed.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.309
As usual, you're completely wrong.

01:12:42.483 --> 01:12:44.440
This? You think I'm wrong?
This is so over the top!

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:45.771
This is obvious.

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.145
Tag me, and I'll give him a hug.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:50.654
And I'll say,
"if she's having a miscarriage,

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:52.072
"this is awful, and you're it."

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:54.196
Are you kidding me right now?

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.486
You know what? This feels like a scene
from <i>What Would</i> You Do?

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:58.996
You get put in a precarious situation,

01:12:59.166 --> 01:13:01.077
and you have to make the right decision.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:02.287
It's all actors and cameras.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:06.170
It's not great television,
but it hooks me in.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:07.330
What?

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:08.790
Come on.

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:10.458
All right, we're good.
We're gonna get to the hospital.

01:13:11.762 --> 01:13:15.676
Jesus. Hey! Jerry? Jerry, if you need
anything I could easily--

01:13:15.766 --> 01:13:17.256
You come near her or my baby,

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.846
I'll crush your windpipe, Bob.

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.179
This ain't no fucking game.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:27.851
Uh...

01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:29.435
I'm pretty sure it's real, guys.

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:32.732
I will be so pissed
if she didn't have a miscarriage.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:33.899
Chilli!

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.317
We all would be.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:36.859
- It's just a thing you don't...
- Say.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.369
It's implied.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.725
<i>Hey, Linda. Namaste.</i>

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.896
Shouldn't you boys be getting cleaned up
for the wedding?

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:07.228
Not you, Chilli.
You're perfect.

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:09.229
Thanks, Linda.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.360
I don't think
anybody's gonna be freshening up.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.566
Hoagie, you can't go looking like that.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:23.532
"To everyone asking,
the wedding has been postponed.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.746
"Thank you for your thoughts
and prayers."

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.160
It's from Jerry's mom.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:30.247
- Well, maybe we're bad people.
- Maybe?

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:32.006
Yes, I think we definitely are.

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:33.083
We might be.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:36.636
Tag used to be a thing
that made me really happy.

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:40.261
But now, it's destroying me. I feel sad.

01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:41.765
Shut the fuck up, Sable.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.928
Has anyone seen
the bridesmaids' lnstagram stories?

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.598
Check it out.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:51.522
"Wedding's canceled."
Sad face emoji.

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:54.313
"I can't wear the dress.
Such a pretty dress.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.401
"So sad." Goodbye emoji. "Was it a..."

01:14:56.575 --> 01:15:00.159
Really? ls there any chance
that all these women could post banal,

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.445
minute-by-minute moments from their day,

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.656
with mind-numbing captions
at the same time?

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.666
- Totally.
- Absolutely. That's all lnstagram is.

01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:09.119
- Yeah.
- I don't know about this, guys.

01:15:09.296 --> 01:15:11.663
It doesn't feel right. I smell a rat.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:12.792
That's what I've been saying.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:13.873
I have been actually saying this
the whole time.

01:15:14.051 --> 01:15:17.715
Hey, sweetheart, can we just move on?
It's over.

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:19.720
But it's not. Now, come on, guys.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.339
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:23.007
- Bob.
- What'd I do?

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.266
Can I take a photograph of you?

01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:25.802
No. Okay.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:26.886
Cute.

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:28.596
I'm gonna set up
an lnstagram account for you.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:29.764
Please don't.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.392
Rachel Ditmus is the only bridesmaid
with a private lnstagram account.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:34.811
She's been wanting you to finger bang
her since the sixth grade.

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:38.114
If anybody's stupid enough
to fall for our request,

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.817
it will be that dum-dum.

01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:44.029
And sent.
All we've got to do now is wait.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:46.285
And accepted!

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.915
- Really?
- That was weirdly fast.

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:49.325
Do not finger bang her.

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:52.245
Oh, my God. I was right.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.539
- What? What are we looking at here?
- What the hell is this?

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:55.798
A wedding dress.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:56.958
What the fuck?

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:58.918
They faked the fucking miscarriage!

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.508
No, no, no. Jerry's going down.
We're gonna destroy that wedding.

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:03.343
- Let's go!
- This is bullshit. That is so fucked up.

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:04.507
Absolutely.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:08.928
Hoagie?

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:12.598
Hoagie, what are you doing?

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:14.063
Damn it!

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.106
- Sweetie.
- Hoagie?

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.611
Be careful.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.156
Should we stop him, or...

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.533
I'm not getting near him.
He's swinging that bat around.

01:16:25.206 --> 01:16:27.197
- Sweetie, that's your mom's.
- Yeah, you're gonna hurt yourself.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:40.965
We lost! He beat us! The game is over!

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:44.381
We can't tag Jerry.

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:49.515
It's just time for us to come to terms
with that. He's untouchable. That's it.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.270
What do you wanna do?
You wanna just give up?

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.932
Yeah, Bob. I wanna give up.
It's time to give up.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.692
Come on, Hogan. You're not a quitter.

01:16:55.861 --> 01:16:57.192
What's the alternative?

01:16:57.655 --> 01:17:00.192
We go to the wedding.
We try to tag him. We fail.

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:02.273
And we fuck up the wedding?

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:03.858
That's not a cool move.
That's a dick move.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:05.572
That's not what friends do.
That's what assholes do.

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:08.534
Hoagie! He faked a fucking miscarriage.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:10.789
This is a miscarriage of justice.

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.167
This is where we get him.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:14.543
He deserves to pay for that.

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:17.754
Even if we wanted to do that,
we all signed an amendment.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:21.168
Amendments are null and void
if you fake a miscarriage.

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:22.881
That's just basic contract law.

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:24.637
- That's law. Basic contract law.
- Law.

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:25.797
Like he said.

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.262
- I literally said exactly that.
- I know. We're saying it together.

01:17:28.435 --> 01:17:31.769
But I was also right earlier
because I said the miscarriage was fake.

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:35.975
The amendment stands,
and maybe that's a good thing.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:39.477
Maybe it's time to grow up a little.

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:41.775
- Uh...
- I'm going to the wedding.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:46.948
And you guys can do what you want.
I hope you come too.

01:17:47.121 --> 01:17:48.953
Chilli, just put on a tie.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.411
Sweetie.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:58.295
Do you even have a tie?

01:17:58.465 --> 01:17:59.626
Yes, I have a tie.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.424
- Do you need to borrow a tie?
- Yes, I need to borrow a tie.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.500
<i>Okay.</i>

01:18:44.595 --> 01:18:47.758
Hi! I'm so glad you made it!

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:49.088
Is that champagne?

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:51.220
I know. Ugh.

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:53.351
I'm the girl who cried miscarriage.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.854
But I had to get him out of that room
and distract you for a couple of hours

01:18:57.024 --> 01:18:58.480
so that the amendment could kick in.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.267
Wait. Are you even pregnant?

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:01.772
No, I was never pregnant.

01:19:01.946 --> 01:19:03.061
You were never pregnant?

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.270
Whoa.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:05.855
Just listen. Jerry knew

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:07.819
that you guys might get the drop on him

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.701
so "Operation Miscarriage"
was our fail-safe.

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:13.033
- It was an operation?
- It was actually my idea.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:14.739
- Brilliant. Brilliant!
- Ah, thanks.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:16.078
That's diabolical.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:19.244
Everyone's just pissed because you won,
and they're boys.

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:22.626
They can't get pregnant,
so they can't fake a miscarriage.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:24.169
It's true.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:26.550
Look, I'm not saying I want you
to have a miscarriage.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.710
Then don't.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:31.051
'Cause that would be terrible.
But if you ever do have a miscarriage,

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:33.762
I don't wanna say that you would
deserve it 'cause that's too far,

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:36.303
but what I will say and what I do feel

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:38.437
is that's what you get.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:42.066
Okay. It's fine.
We can all have different feelings.

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.814
But it's our wedding day, you guys.
Come on.

01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:47.105
And we came up with this great amendment

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:51.902
so that we could all enjoy this day
together and have fun and relax.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.160
Are we cool?

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.863
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Not yet.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:20:00.665
Sorry. Not cool yet.
It's just, you did murder a child.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:01.744
No.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:02.874
She didn't.
No, it was a fake miscarriage.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.915
Yeah, not the imaginary child
that was inside of you,

01:20:06.093 --> 01:20:09.836
but the actual inner child
that lives inside of me

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:11.254
got decapitated.

01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:15.805
Head flew up, did flips in the air,
blood spurting everywhere.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:19.471
Hoagie, Jerry has a perfect record,

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:21.104
and we're a team now.

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:22.682
The winning team.

01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:25.602
And I just feel like, Hoagie,
if you're gonna play

01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:28.942
a children's game as a grown man,

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:31.858
maybe, next time,
don't play like a child.

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:37.496
Anyways, I am really excited
you guys are here.

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.203
Try the raw bar. It's off the hook.

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:42.493
It's my wedding!
I'm getting married!

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:45.288
- Congratulations.
- Come on! Grab it!

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:52.837
I take back everything I said
about her being effervescent.

01:20:53.599 --> 01:20:55.431
I met Jerry in AA.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:58.514
You see, people,
I got a lot of problems.

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:03.727
Anger issues. I left my wife.
I have many kids.

01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:07.144
And this man
got me to turn to the cloth.

01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:09.107
It was a low point in my life.

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:11.443
There was jail time involved.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:13.824
I briefly converted to Islam.

01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:18.238
I lost a long legal battle
with Jo-Ann Fabrics.

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:21.658
During that time, I got to know
Jerry and Susan as a couple.

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:22.950
And that is a true blessing.

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:25.540
What's the difference between
Episcopalian and Lutheran?

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.172
Episcopalians don't eat fish.

01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:33.007
That's pescatarian.
That's not a religion.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:34.841
They're all fanatics. I don't know.

01:21:35.599 --> 01:21:38.432
Remind me again, is it on the kiss
or after they walk back down the aisle?

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:41.344
Seriously?
You said you'd worked weddings before.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:45.436
The kiss, the doves, end of ceremony.
The groom was very specific about this.

01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.317
...and finds new ways
of expressing love

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:51.271
through the ups and downs of life.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:54.816
Susan, do you take Jerry
to be your husband?

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.994
Do you promise to love, honor,
cherish and protect him,

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:02.157
forsaking all others,
holding only to him forever more?

01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:03.916
I do.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:05.076
Beautiful.

01:22:05.254 --> 01:22:07.086
There's gonna be a window.

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.247
- What, sweetie?
- The doves.

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:11.378
What about the doves?

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.209
There's an opening.

01:22:13.637 --> 01:22:15.378
Just relax, honey.

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:17.759
You seem stressed.

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:21.634
Jerry, do you take Susan
to be your wife?

01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:25.726
Do you promise to love, honor, cherish,
and protect her

01:22:25.899 --> 01:22:30.018
forsaking all others,
holding only to her forever more?

01:22:30.112 --> 01:22:31.318
I do.

01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:33.274
I mean, this is actually
kind of beautiful.

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:35.281
It really is, man.

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.029
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:41.616
You may kiss the bride.

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:43.455
I love you.

01:23:28.921 --> 01:23:30.286
- Hoagie!
- Go, go, go!

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.671
- Oh, God! Guys, go!
- Hoagie! You okay?

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.127
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:23:34.718 --> 01:23:35.708
Hey, man.

01:23:36.178 --> 01:23:37.168
Buddy?

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:39.090
- You scared away the swans.
- Hoagie?

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:41.714
- Hogan? Hogan.
- Hoagie!

01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:44.224
I can't believe that you guys did this.
Right now.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:47.557
Well, I don't think you get to claim
the moral high ground over us, actually.

01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:48.812
Yeah, you're not better than us.

01:23:48.982 --> 01:23:50.768
You and your wife pretended
to have a goddamn miscarriage.

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.684
Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:55.068
- Misunderstanding.
- In her vagina.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.729
Wow. Oh, boy.

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:58.272
Guys, call a doctor!

01:23:58.450 --> 01:23:59.861
- Can you hear me?
- Buddy?

01:24:00.244 --> 01:24:01.905
- Hey!
- Somebody get a doctor!

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.446
- Bud?
- He's gone full loss of consciousness.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:05.988
That's impressive.

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:07.907
Even better
than your performance. Right?

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:09.742
I know! It's so good!

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.911
Excuse me, uh, everyone...

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:13.620
Everything's fine.

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.548
Uh, this is all just a game.

01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:20.469
He's still unconscious, but he's stable.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:23.381
He really should never have been
this active given his condition.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.516
- You can see him when he wakes up.
- Thanks.

01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:28.515
I got this.

01:24:28.689 --> 01:24:31.306
Excuse me, Doctor. Hey, how are you?

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:34.521
- Yeah.
- Doctor, uh... Doctor Yoon, is it?

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:36.060
- Yes.
- How do you spell that?

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:39.777
- You're looking right at it.
- I know, but I'm just asking you.

01:24:40.284 --> 01:24:41.570
What exactly are you asking me?

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:44.444
My friends and I do this thing.
It's this really weird game.

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:47.029
Is there any chance this is all fake,
that you could just tell me.

01:24:47.207 --> 01:24:48.914
I won't tell the others.

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:50.332
Is this fake?

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.827
- This hospital?
- The whole thing, yeah. Is it fake?

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:54.291
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:56.042
He told you to say that, right?

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:58.833
- Look, I gotta prep a surgery.
- Will you just do me one quick favor?

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.093
Could you recite
the Hippocratic Oath for me?

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:02.879
That's not a thing doctors memorize.

01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.391
Still unsure.

01:25:08.061 --> 01:25:09.643
It's gonna be fine.
It's just, it was a lot.

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:11.224
I mean, how does that all happen
at a wedding?

01:25:12.316 --> 01:25:13.306
Hey, boss.

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:15.016
How did that go?

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:16.479
I'm all turned around.

01:25:16.653 --> 01:25:17.643
About what?

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:20.066
If he's an actor or if he's not.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.358
He's not. He's a doctor.
We're in a hospital.

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:27.115
You're drinking the Kool-Aid.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.203
All right. What do we do?

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.839
Look, Chilli, what's wrong with you?
Just go talk to the girl.

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:39.999
Could be a trap.

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:42.630
She's here for a friend
who is in the hospital. Okay?

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:44.878
You know I'm right. I'm always right.

01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:47.890
Okay, you're right about this,
but you are not always right.

01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:49.346
Buddy, I'm always right,
and you know it's true.

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:50.426
Bob, you're not always right.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.885
-100%...
-1989.

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:53.262
Oh, come on.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.477
Ken Griffey Jr. enters the league,
and what do you say?

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:57.016
"He will never be
<i>as</i> good as his father."

01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:58.400
And he's better than his father.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:00.777
- Where are the rings?
- You are so wrong!

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:03.484
The historical record
has proven that I am right.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.866
You know what? Time will tell.

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:08.740
You will never admit
that you are wrong about anything.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:10.154
I'm not wrong.

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:12.243
Come on, it's been a while
since we've done this.

01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:13.452
Come here, man.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:15.826
This was a fun few days, man.

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:17.369
- I really missed you.
- I missed you too, man.

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:20.372
- You want a breath mint?
- No, I don't want a breath mint.

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:21.756
- Stop it.
- You want a breath mint?

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:24.801
I would love a breath mint.
I got a gross taste in my mouth.

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:33.052
Hey, mind if I sit?

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:34.220
No.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:37.848
Thanks for coming.

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:40.939
- I hope he's okay.
- Yeah, me too.

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:45.989
Um...

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:55.875
I don't know if that...
We're in a hospital and...

01:26:56.044 --> 01:26:57.409
- You know?
- Yes.

01:26:57.587 --> 01:27:00.295
My friend is possibly dying.

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:04.299
But it feels like a time I need
to tell you how I feel about you,

01:27:04.594 --> 01:27:07.302
and I am so pumped
that your husband's dead.

01:27:07.723 --> 01:27:09.054
- No.
- No.

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:12.433
But I'm really happy to see you, Cheryl.

01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:17.396
You are broke and divorced

01:27:17.566 --> 01:27:19.933
-and just a fucking mess, really.
- Yeah.

01:27:20.110 --> 01:27:21.350
But it's fun to see you, too.

01:27:21.528 --> 01:27:23.565
Good. All right. I'll take that.

01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:26.982
I actually think that...

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:30.072
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I would see you again.

01:27:30.996 --> 01:27:32.862
- For real?
- Yeah.

01:27:33.039 --> 01:27:35.076
- Like a little date.
- No, definitely didn't say that.

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.287
- Like a dinner.
- Smaller than that.

01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:39.580
- Like a lunch.
- How about a snack?

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:42.713
I'll take what I can get.

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:46.000
<i>Hoagie, I know you're fucking with me.</i>

01:27:46.845 --> 01:27:52.591
I'm not. I've got a tumor on my liver
the size of my right nut.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:56.386
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:57.970
Yeah.

01:27:58.148 --> 01:28:00.856
I know you're fucking with him,
but what are you doing? What's the plan?

01:28:01.026 --> 01:28:03.518
- Tell us what's going on.
- Chilli, there's no plan.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:04.901
What's going on?

01:28:05.071 --> 01:28:06.607
There's no plan, Chilli.

01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:08.196
Stop winking at me.

01:28:08.366 --> 01:28:10.073
Think it's real.
This looks like it's doing something.

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:12.780
Something real is happening
on this thing right here.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:14.157
<i>How long have you known this?</i>

01:28:14.331 --> 01:28:15.571
For three weeks.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:17.080
Three weeks.

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:20.618
<i>Right nut.
Too specific, I call bullshit.</i>

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:22.286
<i>That's a lie. Right? It's a lie.</i>

01:28:22.464 --> 01:28:23.454
I'm not lying.

01:28:24.090 --> 01:28:26.923
Although I did lie about one thing.

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:29.710
Jerry's not quitting
at the end of the season.

01:28:29.888 --> 01:28:31.424
<i>What? Why the fuck would I quit?</i>

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:33.054
Yeah, I just... I said that

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:36.183
to get everyone together,
you know, for one last round.

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:39.186
Hoagie, tell me you are fucking joking
about this.

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:40.596
Uh, no.

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:47.820
There is a decent chance
I will not be around for next season.

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:57.655
Damn.

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:02.292
And, I mean, plus,
even if you were, you'd be,

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:05.663
you know. Really slow.

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:07.589
A total sitting duck.

01:29:07.676 --> 01:29:10.464
Carrying like an IV bag around,
that's easy.

01:29:10.554 --> 01:29:11.840
I had an uncle that went through chemo,

01:29:11.930 --> 01:29:13.841
and afterwards,
he was terrible at games.

01:29:14.266 --> 01:29:17.008
But I guess that makes sense.
It would be weird if he got better.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:19.676
Then everybody would be getting chemo.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:24.348
I love you guys.

01:29:25.902 --> 01:29:28.485
I love... I love this game. You know?

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:32.781
I don't know what it is.
It just brings out the best in us.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:35.947
Except today.

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:38.950
Today, I don't know.

01:29:39.749 --> 01:29:44.209
I really fucked up your wedding, Jerry,
and I am super sorry.

01:29:45.422 --> 01:29:46.412
Jerry?

01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:49.832
-Has he hung up?
- Jerry?

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:57.722
You didn't fuck up my wedding, Hoagie.
Come on.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.351
- Right?
- No.

01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:02.849
You might have
ruined a moment.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.728
I screwed it up.
You should've been up there with me.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:07.892
All you boys should've.

01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:09.935
That's my fault.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:14.148
I always thought that you guys were just
much closer to each other than to me...

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:15.232
What?

01:30:15.619 --> 01:30:17.576
I mean, if it seems like we were closer,

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:20.245
it's only because
we're physically closer

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:21.655
because you always ran away.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:23.323
Successfully. You know, I mean,

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:25.492
not for nothing, you might actually be

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:27.703
the very best person at this game
on the planet.

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.705
He might be, right?

01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:32.082
Yeah, you're really good at tag.

01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:35.841
Yes, but you've kind of missed
the point.

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:39.177
I mean, it's not about trying
to get away from each other.

01:30:39.267 --> 01:30:44.262
It's actually about having a reason
to be around each other. You know?

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:45.600
Yeah.

01:30:45.982 --> 01:30:47.893
I mean, Ben Franklin said it best.
Am I right?

01:30:48.068 --> 01:30:50.651
"We don't stop playing
'cause we grow old..."

01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:52.273
"We grow old
because we stop playing."

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:55.277
I've been wanting to say for a few years
that quote is not Benjamin Franklin.

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:57.358
That is German anthropologist,
Karl Groos.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:30:59.443
- La, la, la, la, la...
- Why are you ruining the moment?

01:30:59.621 --> 01:31:00.702
- I just don't even want to know.
- He's in the hospital.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.746
- It felt like the right moment.
- It's not the right moment, so...

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:03.867
- It is the right moment.
- It isn't.

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:05.077
So, Jerry, uh...

01:31:09.005 --> 01:31:10.291
It's 11155.

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:13.082
Get in here, and let me tag you.

01:31:17.514 --> 01:31:19.346
You know, I've been so attached,
I suppose,

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:21.093
to my perfect record all these years,

01:31:21.184 --> 01:31:22.970
dominating you fools.

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:25.932
Maybe I should. Maybe I shouldn't.

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:29.064
If you think about it,
Jerry is a tag virgin.

01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:30.436
Or champion.

01:31:30.527 --> 01:31:32.564
Just let us deflower you.

01:31:32.737 --> 01:31:34.068
We'll be gentle.

01:31:34.572 --> 01:31:36.154
<i>I</i> can't.

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:39.024
Come on.

01:31:40.704 --> 01:31:41.694
I can't do it.

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:45.622
Then I'm not gonna tag anybody,
and the game ends with me.

01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:46.995
That's dark.

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:49.452
Or you just let me tag you.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.501
All right, fuck it.

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:01.005
- Oh, God!

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:02.305
Loser! Loser!

01:32:02.392 --> 01:32:03.678
You suck!

01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:05.634
Awesome.

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:09.722
- Yes!
- You officially suck.

01:32:09.816 --> 01:32:10.897
Oh, you're so it!

01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:13.229
Goddamn! All right!

01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:16.728
I love you guys.

01:32:17.741 --> 01:32:18.947
Love you too, man.

01:32:22.996 --> 01:32:26.614
You know we got five minutes
left of May.

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:29.374
I ain't gonna be last it. Bitches!

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:49.977
Look, Bob!
Where are you gonna go, Bob?

01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:51.138
No!

01:32:57.072 --> 01:32:59.564
Verbal amendment?
That women should be playing.

01:33:01.034 --> 01:33:03.196
- Amendment.
- Yeah, amendment.

01:33:04.454 --> 01:33:05.444
Oh.

01:33:05.538 --> 01:33:07.529
Oh, you just made a big mistake.

from black into bright white</i>

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:59.950

01:38:41.332 --> 01:38:44.245
<i>She couldn't quite explain it</i>

01:38:44.419 --> 01:38:50.586
