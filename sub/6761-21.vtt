01:52.695 --> 01:56.782
Well, Brandon, spring is in the air
and it is driving me crazy.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.869
- You smell that?
- What?

01:59.952 --> 02:02.496
That sweet, overripe flower scent?

02:04.206 --> 02:07.960
Nature's doing its thing.
And it's turning me into a total dog.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.127
Down, boy.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.964
Oh, oh, put me on a leash.

02:12.506 --> 02:15.342
- Who is that?
- That is Darla Diller.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.136
Haven't you seen her before?

02:17.219 --> 02:18.804
I think I'd recall.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.681
She's only the hottest babe
at West Beverly.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.476
She gives me this look every time
I drive by her in my Vette.

02:23.559 --> 02:25.644
- Darla, hi.
- Hi.

02:28.647 --> 02:32.401
She doesn't know it yet, but I'm gonna
ask her to the Spring Dance.

02:32.484 --> 02:35.070
- Good luck, buddy.
- It's in the bag.

02:35.821 --> 02:37.573
Besides, I hear she's got
this thing for me.

02:37.656 --> 02:39.867
Brandon, I already made
a room reservation.

02:39.950 --> 02:43.037
- What are you talking about?
- The hotel.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.706
The hotel where they're holding
the dance, Brandon.

02:45.789 --> 02:47.499
- Yeah?
- Well, the dance

02:47.583 --> 02:49.752
is only an excuse to grab a room.

02:49.835 --> 02:51.879
- No kidding?
- No kidding!

02:52.337 --> 02:53.922
Yo! Listen up, West Beverly!

02:54.006 --> 02:55.966
<i>I am pleased to announce the names of</i>

02:56.049 --> 02:58.844
the four luscious young ladies
you have chosen

02:58.927 --> 03:01.180
to be this year's Spring Princesses.

03:01.722 --> 03:03.182
<i>Drum roll, please.</i>

03:06.268 --> 03:08.395
Maria Semple.

03:08.937 --> 03:10.188
<i>Amy Ganz.</i>

03:10.272 --> 03:12.065
<i>- Kerry Kidnann.
- He's such a geek.</i>

03:12.149 --> 03:13.942
And my own personal fave,

03:14.443 --> 03:15.694
Kelly Taylor.

03:15.777 --> 03:17.446
<i>Congratulations, Kel.</i>

03:22.951 --> 03:26.079
You know, I've never known
a Spring Princess before.

03:26.163 --> 03:28.707
Well, welcome to the inner circle of life.

03:28.874 --> 03:32.210
So, do you think she's gonna win?

03:34.087 --> 03:37.507
- Win?
- You know, Spring Queen?

03:39.009 --> 03:42.137
Actually, I haven't given it
a lot of thought, Andrea.

03:47.017 --> 03:48.268
Are you

03:49.477 --> 03:52.856
- going to the school dance?
- No. Are you?

03:55.567 --> 03:58.111
- No.
- Personally, I hate to dance.

03:59.863 --> 04:01.614
- You do?
- Yeah.

04:01.698 --> 04:04.075
I always step on people's toes,
I have no sense of rhythm.

04:04.159 --> 04:05.452
It's awful.

04:05.535 --> 04:09.914
So, you probably wouldn't want to go
even if someone asked you.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.126
- I don't know. Would you?
- Well...

04:13.209 --> 04:16.796
I have fundamental ideological
problems with teenage social rituals

04:16.880 --> 04:20.341
that basically do nothing
but exacerbate fears of total insecurity

04:20.425 --> 04:23.761
and inferiority over one's own
appearance while frenetically exploiting,

04:23.845 --> 04:27.181
and I must hasten to add, distorting,
the feminine ideal.

04:27.265 --> 04:29.767
I mean, in an act
which reaches its apogee

04:29.851 --> 04:32.603
with the election of the Spring Queen.

04:35.481 --> 04:37.191
Was that a yes or a no?

04:38.985 --> 04:40.945
What was the question?

04:43.281 --> 04:46.284
- Darla, hi.
- Hi.

04:47.577 --> 04:50.163
- You remember me?
- I'm not sure.

04:50.246 --> 04:54.375
- Steve Sanders. We say hi a lot.
- Oh, hi.

04:58.588 --> 05:02.091
Darla, you know, I don't think
I've had a chance to mention

05:02.174 --> 05:05.219
that I really think you're pretty gorgeous.

05:06.053 --> 05:08.764
And I was wondering if you'd like to go
to the Spring Dance with me.

05:08.848 --> 05:11.309
We can go some place
terminally hip for dinner,

05:11.392 --> 05:15.229
check out the dance,
see what the night has to offer.

05:16.022 --> 05:18.733
- In your car?
- Definitely.

05:19.358 --> 05:21.444
Sorry. I don't do Vettes.

05:22.862 --> 05:27.324
Well, that's all right, I'll...
I'll rent a Jag! A Porsche! A minivan.

05:28.909 --> 05:31.203
- Andrea, hi.
- Hi, Brenda.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.414
- So, did he ask you?
- No.

05:33.497 --> 05:34.957
At least, I don't think so.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.209
- Well, did you ask him?
- No.

05:37.793 --> 05:39.128
Why not?

05:39.378 --> 05:42.298
Andrea, there's nothing wrong
with a girl asking a guy out.

05:42.381 --> 05:45.301
I know. I guess school dances
really aren't my scene.

05:45.384 --> 05:47.094
I mean,
Brandon might come over that night,

05:47.177 --> 05:50.431
you know, we might just hang out,
watch a movie together.

05:50.514 --> 05:52.057
But thanks for your help.

05:52.141 --> 05:54.101
I guess the truth is,
if he really wanted to ask me,

05:54.184 --> 05:56.019
he would have asked me.

05:56.103 --> 05:57.855
- Andrea...
- Look, I got to run.

05:57.938 --> 05:59.773
I'm gonna miss my bus.

05:59.857 --> 06:02.734
- Have fun at the dance, huh?
- Thanks.

06:07.030 --> 06:08.949
- Well, Your Highness.
- Hi.

06:09.032 --> 06:10.868
- This guy giving you a hard time?
- No.

06:10.951 --> 06:13.120
Kelly was just nominated
Spring Princess.

06:13.203 --> 06:14.830
She had to be nominated?

06:14.913 --> 06:17.749
Nat, do you mind if I talk to Brandon
in private for a minute?

06:17.833 --> 06:20.711
In this place
there's no such thing as "private."

06:23.755 --> 06:25.090
What's up?

06:25.632 --> 06:27.300
Brandon, do you have a date
for the dance?

06:27.384 --> 06:29.469
- Nope.
- Neither do I.

06:31.013 --> 06:33.265
You're kidding. You don't have a date?

06:33.348 --> 06:35.142
You don't have to broadcast it.

06:35.225 --> 06:38.353
- I don't get it. Dating's your life, isn't it?
- I know, it is.

06:38.437 --> 06:41.481
But out of all the cute guys
at Beverly or West Beverly,

06:41.565 --> 06:45.652
I've either dated them and never want
to see them again, or they're taken.

06:45.735 --> 06:47.779
All of the cute guys, except you.

06:47.863 --> 06:51.408
- Well, thanks for the compliment.
- So?

06:54.411 --> 06:57.664
- So?
- So, come on, it'll be great.

06:58.331 --> 07:01.918
I don't know, Kelly.
I mean, I wasn't even planning on going.

07:02.002 --> 07:04.587
- Rented suits and dancing.
- I know. I know.

07:04.671 --> 07:07.215
Brandon, I promise you, we'll have fun.

07:07.298 --> 07:09.884
I will show you a really good time.

07:10.593 --> 07:13.972
- Kelly, what are you doing here?
- None of your business.

07:14.055 --> 07:16.015
Well, you're just the person
I was looking for.

07:16.099 --> 07:17.559
Oh, is that so?

07:17.642 --> 07:20.645
Well, I heard you're kind of dateless
for the Spring fling.

07:20.728 --> 07:22.689
Then I guess you heard wrong.

07:23.231 --> 07:26.693
- Who are you doing with?
- Brandon.

07:29.070 --> 07:32.407
- Brandon who?
- Brandon Walsh.

07:36.077 --> 07:39.247
- I thought you said you weren't going.
- I asked him.

07:39.330 --> 07:42.542
I didn't think you'd mind, man,
since you were going with Darla.

07:42.625 --> 07:43.918
Well, I'm not.

07:44.043 --> 07:45.461
Steve, Donna doesn't have a date.

07:45.545 --> 07:47.380
Oh, great, that makes two of us then.

07:47.463 --> 07:48.881
Well, come on, man,
why don't you ask her.

07:48.965 --> 07:51.801
We'll all go together. As friends.
It'll be cool.

07:51.884 --> 07:53.886
Is that how you guys are going?
As friends?

07:53.970 --> 07:55.680
Well, we're not going as enemies.

07:55.763 --> 07:59.142
Come on, man, why don't you ask her?
What can it hurt, huh?

07:59.559 --> 08:01.394
Well, okay. I'll ask her.

08:01.477 --> 08:03.604
But as long as she
doesn't expect anything.

08:03.688 --> 08:05.314
You should be so lucky.

08:05.398 --> 08:07.358
Come on, man, fries are on me.

08:08.359 --> 08:11.028
Brandon, call me.
We have tons of details to discuss.

08:11.112 --> 08:12.571
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:14.615 --> 08:18.953
- So what happened with Darla, man?
- She cut me, she cut me deep.

08:27.128 --> 08:29.922
- Hey, Donna!
- Hey, Steve.

08:31.590 --> 08:34.844
Look, I was wondering if you'd like to go
to the Spring Dance, Saturday night?

08:34.927 --> 08:36.470
You know, it'd be totally platonic,

08:36.554 --> 08:38.681
and you wouldn't have to pay
for anything.

08:41.851 --> 08:43.811
- Well...
- Yes or no?

08:44.562 --> 08:46.730
I... I guess. I...

08:47.106 --> 08:50.818
I... I mean, yes. I guess.

08:51.568 --> 08:53.278
- I mean...
- Great.

08:54.697 --> 08:56.407
Okay, bye.

09:02.621 --> 09:05.165
Brandon, I was thinking,
we could go somewhere great for dinner

09:05.249 --> 09:06.625
like Spago or Le Dome.

09:06.708 --> 09:09.128
But don't worry, since I asked you,
it's totally on me.

09:09.211 --> 09:11.922
The only thing you'll have to worry about
is your tux rental,

09:12.005 --> 09:15.676
something simple and black.
No pastels, no velvet lapels or anything.

09:15.759 --> 09:19.388
And my corsage,
preferably an orchid wrist, and a limo.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.473
Wait a minute.
Who said anything about a limo?

09:21.557 --> 09:23.600
Brandon, I'm a Spring Princess.

09:23.684 --> 09:25.644
I can't exactly show up in a Melvin,

09:25.727 --> 09:28.355
or whatever you're calling your car
these days.

09:28.438 --> 09:32.234
I hate to break it to you Kelly,
but I can't afford a limo.

09:33.610 --> 09:37.030
Brandon, it's okay, I think Dylan
was gonna pay for that anyway.

09:37.114 --> 09:38.448
Hey, guys.

09:38.532 --> 09:40.283
Kelly, congratulations
on Spring Princess,

09:40.367 --> 09:42.702
- I think that's so exciting.
- Thanks.

09:42.786 --> 09:46.164
Brandon, what time do you want
to come over Saturday night?

09:46.248 --> 09:51.211
Oh, listen, Andrea, I kind of decided
to go to the dance after all.

09:51.962 --> 09:54.548
You did? With who?

09:54.631 --> 09:56.591
Don't we make a great couple?

10:00.345 --> 10:02.973
Hey, we can rent a movie
another night, huh?

10:03.890 --> 10:05.475
Right, Brandon.

10:07.727 --> 10:12.190
Excuse me. I... I have to get to class.

10:45.723 --> 10:46.849
I don't understand this.

10:46.933 --> 10:49.018
I thought you said
you didn't want to go to the dance.

10:49.102 --> 10:51.020
Well, I thought you said
you didn't want to go either.

10:51.104 --> 10:55.108
- I'm doing this as a favor.
- How charitable of you.

10:55.233 --> 10:58.027
Andrea, she asked me to go,
what was I supposed to say?

10:58.111 --> 11:00.113
Right. I mean, what could you say

11:00.196 --> 11:03.032
to one of the most gorgeous girls
in the entire school?

11:04.492 --> 11:06.369
Why are you so mad at me?

11:07.411 --> 11:09.997
Please, don't flatter yourself.

11:10.081 --> 11:13.584
Look, you told me that you could have
the kickboxing story in by lunch.

11:13.668 --> 11:17.171
Can I still count on that
or should I slot something else in?

11:18.214 --> 11:20.424
Sure, you'll have it.

11:26.847 --> 11:29.183
So, guys, what do you think?

11:29.850 --> 11:34.063
- Me thinks thou art styling!
- Not bad, not bad.

11:35.106 --> 11:37.066
Sure costs enough to rent these babies.

11:37.149 --> 11:38.859
Come on,
that's just the tip of the iceberg.

11:38.943 --> 11:44.156
You gotta figure dinner, corsage,
limo, hotel room, we're looking at...

11:45.950 --> 11:47.243
500 bucks.

11:47.326 --> 11:49.245
Oh, jeez, for that much money,
you could be

11:49.328 --> 11:52.331
spending an evening
with the finest call girl in LA.

11:52.414 --> 11:54.458
- No kidding.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

11:54.541 --> 11:57.628
The issue here is honor.
You can't cancel.

11:57.711 --> 11:58.796
That's easy for you to say,

11:58.879 --> 12:02.216
you're gonna spend most of it
in a hotel room with Brenda.

12:03.676 --> 12:05.177
Is that true?

12:05.386 --> 12:08.055
I told you, man,
I don't talk about that stuff.

12:08.138 --> 12:10.099
Good. Let's keep it that way.

12:10.891 --> 12:13.310
Bran, aren't you planning
on renting a room with Kelly?

12:13.393 --> 12:16.480
Steve, we're just going as friends,
you know that.

12:16.563 --> 12:18.357
Yeah, we'll see about that.

12:18.524 --> 12:20.526
She's got a thing for you, Brandon.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.945
She's used to getting what she wants.

12:23.403 --> 12:25.364
Smells like mothballs.

12:26.073 --> 12:29.409
Slap on some cheap cologne,
she won't notice a thing.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.544
I have to find something fabulously hip.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.797
I need something fabulously sexy.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.548
Something incredible.

12:43.799 --> 12:45.384
Something affordable.

12:45.884 --> 12:46.968
No.

12:47.385 --> 12:48.470
No.

12:49.096 --> 12:50.347
Gross.

12:50.722 --> 12:51.932
Grosser.

12:52.140 --> 12:53.517
Grossest.

12:55.936 --> 12:57.020
This is it!

12:57.103 --> 12:58.563
Oh, my God!

12:58.647 --> 13:00.732
- I found it!
- Let me see.

13:03.276 --> 13:05.362
Oh, what are we gonna do?

13:06.279 --> 13:08.114
Actually, it's tacky.

13:09.115 --> 13:10.700
No wonder, look at the price!

13:10.784 --> 13:13.036
It's a cheap knockoff of the real thing.

13:13.119 --> 13:14.913
- You think?
- Absolutely.

13:14.996 --> 13:17.248
You can have it if you want.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.419
- No, you can have it.
- I wouldn't wear it.

13:26.674 --> 13:28.301
What do you guys think?

13:28.384 --> 13:30.595
- Donna!
- It's outrageous!

13:41.522 --> 13:43.524
- Hey, great dress.
- Thanks.

13:43.608 --> 13:45.318
- Hey, Bran.
- Hey, Steve.

13:45.401 --> 13:48.112
- Your limo has arrived, sir.
- Thank you, sire!

13:48.196 --> 13:50.865
Hey, guys, I kind of need
some help here, please, anyone.

13:50.948 --> 13:52.033
Great.

13:52.116 --> 13:53.326
I think I need some help, too.

13:53.409 --> 13:55.453
Steve, what's the matter with you, man?
Put that away.

13:55.536 --> 13:57.038
Relax. I'm not driving.

13:57.121 --> 13:59.332
Yeah, he'll probably just puke
all over everybody in the limo.

13:59.415 --> 14:01.084
No, no, just on you.

14:01.167 --> 14:03.211
Oh, hey, wait, before I forget.

14:09.550 --> 14:12.136
Oh, wow. Thank you. It's beautiful.

14:14.764 --> 14:18.059
- Well, here's yours.
- Oh, it's very...

14:18.142 --> 14:19.185
Hip?

14:19.268 --> 14:21.270
Vegetable corsages are totally hot.

14:21.354 --> 14:25.024
And that is the way I want you
to look tonight in case I win.

14:25.107 --> 14:26.359
Brenda!

14:26.817 --> 14:27.902
Typical.

14:27.985 --> 14:30.029
It's not gonna look good if I'm late.

14:30.112 --> 14:33.324
Wow, just look at all of you.
Everyone looks just...

14:35.701 --> 14:36.869
What?

14:38.412 --> 14:40.498
Kelly, you're wearing...

14:40.581 --> 14:42.083
What? What is it?

14:42.166 --> 14:43.501
Well, it's such a beautiful dress!

14:43.584 --> 14:46.086
- I think it's... It's so beautiful...
- Oh, my God!

14:48.589 --> 14:50.508
Brenda, how could you!

14:52.635 --> 14:54.136
You said you hated it!

14:54.220 --> 14:55.971
You called it cheap and tacky!

14:56.055 --> 14:57.640
You said you weren't gonna buy it!

14:57.723 --> 14:58.974
Well, I changed my mind!

14:59.058 --> 15:01.977
- Well, you'll just have to go change.
- No, you're gonna have to go change!

15:02.061 --> 15:03.771
Brenda, I am a Spring Princess.

15:03.854 --> 15:06.023
Kelly, I don't give a damn.

15:06.899 --> 15:08.525
Do you know
how important this is to me?

15:08.609 --> 15:10.694
Well, maybe you've made it
too important.

15:10.778 --> 15:12.613
Maybe you are just jealous.

15:13.906 --> 15:15.991
You do know what this is
gonna look like, don't you?

15:16.075 --> 15:17.951
- What?
- Like we planned this.

15:18.035 --> 15:20.621
Like we planned to go
as the Bobbsey twins.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.250
- Hey, girls.
- Hi, Dad.

15:26.376 --> 15:28.212
What's all the fuss about?

15:28.295 --> 15:31.006
Hey, come on, you both look gorgeous.

15:31.423 --> 15:33.634
Now come on,
let's have a little smile, huh?

15:33.717 --> 15:36.053
Come on, all right.

15:36.136 --> 15:40.057
Wait till you see this picture.
You look just like the Bobbsey twins.

15:40.766 --> 15:42.142
Excuse me.

15:47.522 --> 15:50.108
I'll just put it on my wrist, okay?

15:51.902 --> 15:54.446
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Just groovy.

15:54.529 --> 15:55.822
Okay, you beautiful people.

15:55.906 --> 15:58.492
Let's get a picture,
everybody together now.

15:58.575 --> 16:01.203
- You look incredible.
- Thank you.

16:01.661 --> 16:03.371
And I can't tell you
what else I'm thinking,

16:03.455 --> 16:06.041
'cause your parents are in the room.

16:06.124 --> 16:07.792
Watch the dress.

16:08.001 --> 16:09.461
Okay, everybody get closer.

16:09.544 --> 16:11.087
A little closer. Can you get closer?

16:11.171 --> 16:14.007
I think she's hiding an army of midgets
under here.

16:14.090 --> 16:16.718
Okay, one, two.

16:50.668 --> 16:52.378
Tell me about it.

16:56.758 --> 16:58.718
Come on, we're gonna be late!

17:05.724 --> 17:07.268
Gets them every time.

17:07.977 --> 17:09.311
You are such a jerk.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.939
Hey, hey, hey, come on, guys,
it's supposed to be fun, remember?

17:12.022 --> 17:15.067
That's right, damn it!
We're supposed to be having fun!

17:15.151 --> 17:17.403
Brenda, I have a great idea.

17:17.487 --> 17:19.655
Why don't you and I stand
on different sides of the room,

17:19.739 --> 17:21.115
that way nobody has to see us.

17:21.199 --> 17:24.660
Kelly, at this point, I'm sorry that we
can't stay on opposite sides of the state.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.287
- Guys! Help.
- Brenda!

17:28.455 --> 17:32.251
Guys! Help, please.
Could someone help me? Oh, God.

17:33.669 --> 17:34.920
Thanks a lot.

17:35.504 --> 17:37.715
That dress is a dance don't.

17:40.718 --> 17:43.095
Hey, hey, wait a second, relax.

17:43.554 --> 17:45.806
It's like she thinks it's her night
or something.

17:45.890 --> 17:48.559
Well, it's not. Bren, this is your night.

17:48.642 --> 17:52.521
Actually, it's our night.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.691
Room 271.

17:58.736 --> 18:01.071
Won't anybody notice that we're gone?

18:01.655 --> 18:05.993
We'll make our appearance,
and then we'll make our disappearance.

18:06.910 --> 18:10.247
And you won't have to worry
about your clothes for a while.

18:31.852 --> 18:35.230
- Brandon, let's dance.
- I told you, Kelly. I don't dance.

18:35.314 --> 18:37.065
Oh, come on.
I've gotta be seen on the dance floor.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.067
Well, then, why don't you
dance with Steve and I'll watch?

18:39.151 --> 18:40.235
No, forget that.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.863
Well, excuse us,
we're gonna go dance now.

18:44.239 --> 18:46.241
- Brandon, please?
- All right, all right.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.368
- Okay, Donna, hold this.
- Sure.

18:50.329 --> 18:52.372
Steve, do you want to...

18:53.290 --> 18:56.501
- We... Oh, sorry.
- Spit it out, Donna.

18:56.585 --> 18:59.087
Would... Would you like to dance?

18:59.963 --> 19:02.382
- Maybe later.
- Okay.

19:13.643 --> 19:16.605
There she is. Wow.

19:16.980 --> 19:19.858
I don't think I've ever seen her
looking so beautiful.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.109
Yeah.

19:21.901 --> 19:26.698
You know, 20 bucks says that she
dances with me before the night is over.

19:27.490 --> 19:28.742
You're crazy.

19:29.659 --> 19:31.119
Put up or shut up.

19:32.620 --> 19:35.248
All right, you're on.

19:46.301 --> 19:49.846
What do you say? Fifteen more minutes
and we make our exit?

19:51.097 --> 19:52.807
Dylan, I'm a little nervous.

19:52.891 --> 19:55.935
Bren, don't be,
everything's gonna be great.

19:56.728 --> 19:59.272
Yeah, well,
that's what you keep on saying.

20:00.565 --> 20:03.693
Look, it's just that we've been
building it up for so long.

20:03.776 --> 20:06.612
And it's not that I'm not ready,
believe me, I am.

20:06.696 --> 20:08.865
What are you trying to say?

20:10.700 --> 20:12.744
Somehow you'll be disappointed.

20:13.161 --> 20:15.913
Bren, we're not gonna be
judging each other up there,

20:15.997 --> 20:18.583
we're gonna be enjoying each other.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.752
Well, I bet you used that line before.

20:23.713 --> 20:25.673
Bren, you're not just
another notch on my belt.

20:25.756 --> 20:29.218
If that's what this was about,
I would've had you up there months ago.

20:29.302 --> 20:31.929
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

20:33.889 --> 20:35.683
So, what is this all about?

20:36.726 --> 20:40.187
Don't you know? I love you.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.460
I think you're a really great dancer.

21:04.211 --> 21:06.171
If you can call this dancing.

21:06.881 --> 21:09.800
I also think you look really cute tonight.

21:09.883 --> 21:13.637
- And you definitely look more than cute.
- Thanks.

21:15.139 --> 21:18.434
Brandon, I...
I have a confession to make.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.728
What?

21:21.687 --> 21:25.190
I've thought you were cute
since the first day you moved here.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.569
I'd say that's mutual.

21:30.863 --> 21:33.115
So, what's been stopping us?

21:39.246 --> 21:42.666
Well, not that I haven't given it
a thought or two,

21:43.041 --> 21:45.043
but number one,

21:45.127 --> 21:47.796
you are one of my best friends'
ex-girlfriend.

21:48.505 --> 21:50.674
Emphasis on the "ex."

21:51.008 --> 21:52.134
And?

21:54.803 --> 21:57.681
And you're Brenda's best friend.

21:58.890 --> 22:03.228
Well, Dylan is your best friend
and that hasn't stopped him, has it?

22:03.437 --> 22:04.604
True.

22:06.314 --> 22:07.983
And number three?

22:10.152 --> 22:12.821
You know,
I thought there was a third reason,

22:12.946 --> 22:15.740
but I just can't remember it right now.

22:15.949 --> 22:19.286
Well, sounds like two
not very good reasons to me.

22:39.222 --> 22:41.933
Looks like they're really getting along.

22:42.016 --> 22:43.435
No kidding.

22:47.522 --> 22:50.150
- Kelly, I don't know.
- What?

22:52.068 --> 22:54.612
Something just doesn't feel right.

22:54.737 --> 22:56.573
Well, it feels right to me.

22:58.533 --> 23:00.952
I don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

23:01.035 --> 23:03.288
I mean,
I think you're very beautiful, but...

23:03.371 --> 23:06.291
Brandon, don't you think
we'd make a great couple?

23:06.958 --> 23:08.626
I guess I don't.

23:09.794 --> 23:11.170
It's like,

23:11.295 --> 23:13.756
I know you too well or something.

23:16.509 --> 23:18.970
Well, what if we were
complete strangers?

23:19.053 --> 23:21.556
I'd probably be in love with you.

23:24.267 --> 23:26.602
Can't you fake amnesia or something?

23:29.772 --> 23:34.318
I don't know,
it feels like you're another sister.

23:36.737 --> 23:40.825
That is probably the ugliest thing
any guy has ever said to me.

23:41.242 --> 23:42.493
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

23:42.576 --> 23:43.995
Having fun?

23:44.578 --> 23:46.414
Steve, why don't you get lost?

23:46.497 --> 23:47.957
Brandon, let me give you some advice.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.667
Seeing that the two of you
are getting along so well.

23:49.750 --> 23:53.045
- Steve...
- No, she doesn't care about you.

23:53.671 --> 23:54.964
She may pretend to,

23:55.047 --> 23:57.675
but the only person that Kelly
really cares about is herself.

23:57.758 --> 24:00.469
Hey, why don't you go
and sober up, all right?

24:00.970 --> 24:03.222
I don't blame you
for going for it, though.

24:03.305 --> 24:05.391
- It's fun while it lasts.
- All right, that's enough. Come on.

24:05.474 --> 24:07.184
Hey, hey. This is not a rented tux.

24:07.268 --> 24:08.769
Steve, what's the matter with you, man?

24:08.853 --> 24:11.355
You've been acting like a jerk
all night long.

24:11.438 --> 24:13.607
You said
this was gonna be fun, Brandon.

24:13.691 --> 24:16.568
"Ask Donna. We're all going as friends."

24:17.027 --> 24:19.655
I don't see any friends around here.

24:21.699 --> 24:24.410
- Steve!
- Brandon, just let him go.

24:27.621 --> 24:29.456
I gotta talk to him.

24:35.838 --> 24:37.923
- Steve, wait up!
- Brandon, get lost.

24:38.006 --> 24:40.509
Steve, you got it all wrong.
I'm not going after Kelly.

24:40.592 --> 24:42.344
Brandon, the hell with you guys!
You're both history

24:42.427 --> 24:44.054
- as far as I'm concerned.
- You know that's not true, man.

24:44.137 --> 24:45.430
You know I'm your friend.
You're just drunk.

24:45.514 --> 24:47.349
- You're not seeing things right.
- I am not drunk!

24:47.432 --> 24:49.226
I see things fine, all right?

24:49.309 --> 24:52.104
- Do you know what today is?
- No, what's today?

24:52.896 --> 24:54.439
Today's my birthday.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.819
It's your birthday?
Why didn't you say something?

24:58.902 --> 24:59.945
What am I supposed to do?

25:00.028 --> 25:02.155
Go around and announce it
to everybody?

25:02.239 --> 25:04.408
Well, now I understand
why you're so bummed, man.

25:04.491 --> 25:06.201
We'll go out and celebrate
after the dance.

25:06.284 --> 25:08.203
No, forget it.
I don't feel like celebrating anything.

25:08.286 --> 25:10.914
Steve, there's nothing going on
between me and Kelly!

25:10.997 --> 25:12.874
I know that, Brandon.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.168
Then why are you acting
like such a jerk, man?

25:15.252 --> 25:17.212
It's your birthday, cheer up.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.759
Six months ago,
I'm out to dinner with my mother

25:22.843 --> 25:25.262
and she has a little bit
too much to drink.

25:25.345 --> 25:29.724
She starts talking about the past,
things that happened 20 years ago.

25:30.350 --> 25:31.434
Forget it.

25:31.518 --> 25:33.561
No, come on, Steve, what is it?

25:35.480 --> 25:38.900
She and my dad had been trying
to have kids for a long time,

25:38.984 --> 25:41.361
but they just couldn't make it happen.

25:41.736 --> 25:43.446
So my mom goes to some doctor

25:43.530 --> 25:46.157
who tells her
that she could never have kids.

25:46.825 --> 25:47.867
Yeah?

25:48.910 --> 25:51.496
Well, they decided to adopt a child.

25:52.539 --> 25:54.165
They adopted me.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.043
Oh, man.

25:57.126 --> 26:00.797
Only my mom waits close to 17 years
before she tells me about it.

26:01.089 --> 26:03.716
What did she think,
I'd be better off if I didn't know?

26:03.800 --> 26:06.636
Well, what did you say to her
when she told you?

26:07.095 --> 26:08.805
What could I say?

26:09.806 --> 26:12.517
She's... She's Mom.

26:14.268 --> 26:17.021
She's the only mother I've ever known.

26:18.022 --> 26:21.526
And I know that even though
she might not be perfect,

26:22.485 --> 26:23.986
she loves me.

26:26.948 --> 26:29.700
I just can't believe she's lied to me
my entire life.

26:29.784 --> 26:32.203
Yeah, but, Steve, it worked out.

26:32.495 --> 26:36.082
Look at you, you're a great guy.
You got a great life.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.460
I try not to think about it.

26:39.919 --> 26:43.130
Who my biological parents are,
stuff like that.

26:43.923 --> 26:46.676
Who cares? It doesn't matter anymore.

26:49.428 --> 26:51.180
It's just now that
my birthday's come around,

26:51.263 --> 26:53.474
I'm having a little trouble dealing with it.

26:53.557 --> 26:56.727
But you got a lot of friends
who really care about you, man.

26:56.811 --> 26:59.772
Please, the only friend
I ever told about this was Kelly.

26:59.855 --> 27:03.943
And she's so into her own trip tonight,
she probably forgot all about me.

27:06.153 --> 27:08.114
What is the sense
of confiding in somebody

27:08.197 --> 27:10.783
if someday
they're just gonna blow you off?

27:12.910 --> 27:14.078
<i>The votes are in,</i>

27:14.161 --> 27:17.248
<i>and you the people
of West Beverly High have chosen.</i>

27:17.331 --> 27:20.334
<i>It is my great honor
to announce this year's</i>

27:20.417 --> 27:22.962
<i>West Beverly High Spring Queen.</i>

27:24.171 --> 27:26.924
<i>And the winner is. Drum roll, please.</i>

27:34.431 --> 27:36.141
<i>Kelly Taylor!</i>

27:45.901 --> 27:48.278
<i>- I knew you'd nail it.
- Thanks.</i>

27:51.365 --> 27:54.159
<i>And in the great West Beverly tradition,</i>

27:54.243 --> 27:57.955
<i>the Spring Queen
will now choose her king.</i>

28:05.462 --> 28:06.672
<i>Brad Phillips.</i>

28:18.100 --> 28:20.519
<i>And now it's time to get down
and get noticed,</i>

28:20.602 --> 28:24.272
<i>because we're about to choose
the couple with the slickest moves.</i>

28:24.564 --> 28:27.067
<i>The winning couple
will receive a free large pizza</i>

28:27.150 --> 28:30.153
<i>with two toppings
and two beverages of choice</i>

28:30.237 --> 28:32.197
<i>from Le Pizza in Beverly Hills,</i>

28:32.280 --> 28:35.033
<i>and the honor
of the last dance of the night</i>

28:35.116 --> 28:37.661
<i>with the Spring Queen and King.</i>

28:37.744 --> 28:39.454
I hope it's somebody cute.

28:41.790 --> 28:44.209
- Wish me luck, Kel.
- Break a leg.

28:44.334 --> 28:46.795
Dylan, wait until we're in the room.

28:50.340 --> 28:52.634
Dylan, this is so beautiful.

28:52.884 --> 28:54.636
Yeah, I thought you'd like it.

28:54.719 --> 28:57.263
Do you know why I'm so lucky?

28:59.140 --> 29:00.266
Why?

29:00.934 --> 29:04.896
How many girls get to have sex for
the first time with someone they love?

29:04.979 --> 29:06.147
I don't know.

29:06.231 --> 29:09.108
I've never really taken an opinion poll.

29:14.113 --> 29:17.200
Dylan! Dylan, stop! Put me down!

29:19.118 --> 29:21.245
I'm sorry, I just can't control myself.

29:21.329 --> 29:23.081
Well, don't fight it.

29:24.374 --> 29:27.126
- We are in the room.
- We certainly are.

29:49.774 --> 29:53.027
<i>Betty, for God's sakes,
put down that chainsaw!</i>

29:53.110 --> 29:56.030
<i>You said you liked me.</i>

29:56.113 --> 30:01.160
<i>- I do. I do. I really do.
- I do, too. We all do.</i>

30:01.243 --> 30:04.705
<i>You said he liked me.</i>

30:04.789 --> 30:06.457
<i>Betty, no!</i>

30:12.463 --> 30:15.758
<i>Andrea, for God's sakes,
put down that chainsaw!</i>

30:15.841 --> 30:19.595
<i>You said you liked me.</i>

30:20.012 --> 30:22.056
<i>I do. I do. I really do.</i>

30:22.139 --> 30:24.225
<i>- I like you, too.
- I do, too.</i>

30:24.308 --> 30:25.976
<i>- Me, too, really.
- I love you.</i>

30:26.060 --> 30:27.144
<i>You're a goddess.</i>

30:27.227 --> 30:30.689
<i>You said you liked me.</i>

30:50.709 --> 30:53.837
Mom, can I borrow your evening gown?

31:06.975 --> 31:08.435
Congratulations.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.979
Bran, where have you been?
And where's Brenda?

31:11.063 --> 31:13.815
I'm not exactly getting
a lot of support here from my friends.

31:13.899 --> 31:16.568
Well, you're not the only one
that's feeling that way, Kelly.

31:16.651 --> 31:17.986
I've just been out there with Steve.

31:18.070 --> 31:19.821
I really think you should
abdicate your throne

31:19.905 --> 31:21.239
and go talk to him for a minute.

31:21.323 --> 31:23.158
Brandon, I don't want to,
he's been drinking.

31:23.241 --> 31:24.701
It's one of the reasons why we broke up.

31:24.785 --> 31:26.953
Kelly, he needs you.

31:29.039 --> 31:31.166
Why can't he go talk to Donna?

31:34.586 --> 31:37.005
Because it's his birthday today.

31:38.757 --> 31:41.384
He's really not taking it very well.

31:41.468 --> 31:45.430
I totally forgot. Did he tell you?

31:46.139 --> 31:47.307
Yeah.

31:53.188 --> 31:55.732
- Don't let anybody sit here.
- Okay.

32:17.295 --> 32:18.671
Hi, Steve.

32:20.006 --> 32:23.176
Kelly, what are you doing here?

32:23.635 --> 32:27.221
Shouldn't you be on your throne
lording it over the whole school?

32:29.515 --> 32:32.935
Look, I'm sorry, I forgot.

32:34.979 --> 32:37.815
- Brandon tell you I was out here?
- Yeah.

32:40.151 --> 32:43.112
Well, look, I don't need your sympathy.

32:44.030 --> 32:47.241
I just don't understand
why we can't be friends.

32:47.325 --> 32:52.038
I confided in you, Kelly.
I told you things I haven't told anybody.

32:52.872 --> 32:55.249
I know. Like I said, I'm sorry.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.835
Yeah, well, sorry doesn't make it okay.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.921
This whole week,
all you could think about was yourself,

33:01.005 --> 33:04.508
this stupid dance, a ridiculous contest.

33:04.592 --> 33:07.470
You know, it's a good thing
they're not judging loyalty or character,

33:07.553 --> 33:11.807
because let me tell you something,
you'd have lost by a landslide.

33:12.516 --> 33:15.436
I don't have to stand here and take this.

33:15.603 --> 33:18.189
And who are you
to lecture me on character?

33:18.272 --> 33:20.232
You are generally
one of the most thoughtless

33:20.316 --> 33:22.485
and spoiled people I have ever known.

33:22.568 --> 33:25.362
Well, surprise,
we have a lot in common.

33:25.654 --> 33:28.657
You're the only one I know
who's as defective as I am.

33:28.741 --> 33:30.910
I am not defective, Steve.

33:31.076 --> 33:32.411
Oh, yeah?

33:32.494 --> 33:36.373
Your mom spends half her life in detox,
the other half of her life unconscious.

33:36.457 --> 33:37.541
Shut up!

33:37.625 --> 33:40.127
And I've never even met the man
who you claim is your father.

33:40.210 --> 33:42.046
Although I suppose
it doesn't matter too much

33:42.129 --> 33:44.798
as long as the checks
keep coming in on time.

33:45.215 --> 33:47.468
Why are you trying to ruin my night?

33:49.428 --> 33:51.972
I'm not trying to ruin your night.

33:58.228 --> 34:02.191
I just get so angry when
all you had to do was say one word.

34:02.274 --> 34:05.527
Just one word to let me know
you cared about me!

34:06.737 --> 34:08.947
I do care about you, Steve.

34:09.114 --> 34:12.451
I said I'm sorry,
I don't know what else I can do.

34:14.328 --> 34:15.871
I don't know.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.875
I'm sorry, too.

34:22.835 --> 34:25.172
I don't know why I said these things.

34:26.422 --> 34:29.342
'Cause deep inside
you're just a jerk, that's why.

35:52.717 --> 35:56.304
- Brandon.
- Andrea, hi!

35:56.804 --> 35:59.807
Look, I feel like a fool for coming, but...

36:00.266 --> 36:02.893
But I don't care,
all I know is I don't want to turn

36:02.977 --> 36:06.522
into some deranged axe murderer or...
Or worse yet,

36:06.605 --> 36:09.150
wake up one morning
10 years from now

36:09.233 --> 36:13.696
and suddenly realize
that I totally missed out on high school.

36:16.157 --> 36:17.408
Come on.

36:20.286 --> 36:23.747
Anybody tell you you look
absolutely gorgeous this evening?

36:26.500 --> 36:28.335
Nobody that matters.

36:49.356 --> 36:52.609
<i>Okay, so we're down to four couples.</i>

36:52.943 --> 36:55.487
<i>So your applause
at the end of this next song</i>

36:55.571 --> 36:58.282
<i>will determine tonight's winning couple.</i>

37:05.038 --> 37:07.040
Brenda, you're glowing.

37:07.666 --> 37:09.877
Yeah, well, you have a goofy grin
all over your face

37:09.960 --> 37:11.128
and you'd better wipe it off,

37:11.211 --> 37:14.172
- otherwise people will talk.
- So let them.

37:18.302 --> 37:20.387
Bren, you don't have to do that.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.556
What will the maid think?

37:22.973 --> 37:27.686
They will think that two people had
a very, very good time here tonight.

38:19.696 --> 38:21.197
Kelly, you won! You won!

38:21.281 --> 38:23.908
Brenda, get down!
Before everybody sees, get down!

38:23.992 --> 38:26.494
Kelly, who cares? Congratulations!

38:28.955 --> 38:31.749
I'm so sorry. I've been so selfish.

38:31.833 --> 38:33.751
It's okay. I forgive you.

38:36.045 --> 38:38.047
Where have you been all night?

38:39.007 --> 38:42.635
And... And why are you
so disgustingly happy?

38:48.015 --> 38:49.475
You didn't?

38:52.520 --> 38:53.813
You did.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.734
Oh, my God!

38:59.068 --> 39:01.737
- I don't believe you. Really?
- Yes!

39:41.569 --> 39:44.196
<i>Okay, we're finally down
to two couples.</i>

39:44.280 --> 39:47.032
<i>And once again,
your applause decides the winner.</i>

39:47.116 --> 39:49.410
<i>So, couple number one.</i>

39:52.788 --> 39:54.331
Yeah, baby! Hot!

39:57.501 --> 40:00.003
<i>And couple number two.</i>

40:18.397 --> 40:21.108
<i>All right, this is the last dance
of the evening,</i>

40:21.191 --> 40:22.901
<i>so everybody out on the floor.</i>

41:08.738 --> 41:10.949
- Andrea.
- Yeah?

41:11.908 --> 41:15.912
- Would you like to dance?
- I'd love to.

41:36.766 --> 41:39.936
- Don't hold me so close.
- Oh, sorry.

41:41.688 --> 41:44.232
- You know what?
- What?

41:45.858 --> 41:48.736
You smell as good
as I thought you would.

41:49.153 --> 41:51.489
What did I do to deserve this?

41:51.864 --> 41:57.703
Brandon, do you think I'm a geek
for coming to this dance by myself?

41:58.830 --> 42:00.414
No, not at all.

42:01.666 --> 42:04.627
We never get to slow dance
in the newsroom.

42:18.808 --> 42:21.185
Would you excuse me for a minute,
I'll be right back.

42:21.268 --> 42:22.436
Sure.

42:27.191 --> 42:30.694
- May I?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

42:31.112 --> 42:32.405
Thank you.

42:35.199 --> 42:38.661
You know, Kel,
we really weren't finished out there.

42:39.203 --> 42:43.332
- I know, Steve...
- Quiet, let me talk for a second.

42:44.625 --> 42:46.001
I'm sorry.

42:48.420 --> 42:49.755
I am, too.

42:49.838 --> 42:53.509
- I've been a jerk all night.
- Me, too.

42:53.592 --> 42:58.305
I know, but despite all the things
we've gone through,

43:00.015 --> 43:04.353
all the fights, all the stupid things
we've ever said to each other,

43:04.728 --> 43:06.688
I still love you, Kelly.

43:06.772 --> 43:08.107
And I don't care what you say

43:08.190 --> 43:11.485
because I know deep down inside
you love me, too.

43:12.903 --> 43:16.657
Maybe, but not the way you mean.

43:16.907 --> 43:20.160
There's lots of different ways
of loving someone.

43:20.911 --> 43:24.331
Then I guess in my own way,
I love you, too, Steve.

43:25.165 --> 43:26.750
Happy birthday.

43:30.879 --> 43:34.257
Could I get another one right here,
you know the spot.

43:34.341 --> 43:35.634
Come on.

43:39.054 --> 43:42.682
Steve, have you asked Donna
to dance one time tonight?

43:43.141 --> 43:44.226
No.

43:49.689 --> 43:51.149
What are you doing?

43:52.776 --> 43:56.446
Steve wants to apologize
for being such a lousy date.

43:56.821 --> 43:58.865
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

43:59.199 --> 44:02.077
I'm sorry for wearing
such a stupid dress.

44:02.160 --> 44:04.704
Well, actually, you look beautiful in it.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.040
Hey, is this a private party?

44:07.499 --> 44:10.919
- Oh, you look gorgeous!
- Thanks.

44:11.002 --> 44:13.213
You should be wearing this, not me.

44:15.674 --> 44:16.883
Thank you.

44:16.966 --> 44:18.885
Hey, what's going on in here?

44:18.968 --> 44:21.888
Nothing as wild as
what was going on upstairs.

44:21.971 --> 44:24.516
What was going on upstairs anyway?

44:24.599 --> 44:25.975
What are you guys talking about?

44:26.059 --> 44:28.228
We were down here
dancing the whole time.

44:28.311 --> 44:29.687
Of course.

44:30.104 --> 44:33.483
Is it just me or was tonight one
of the strangest nights of all time?

44:33.566 --> 44:35.485
Definitely one of the strangest nights.

44:35.568 --> 44:37.654
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

44:37.987 --> 44:40.240
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

44:41.449 --> 44:45.620
What can I say? Spring is in the air.
