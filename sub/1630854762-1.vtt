00:01.669 --> 00:03.168
(mysterious music)

00:15.090 --> 00:19.184
(heavy breathing)

00:19.411 --> 00:20.519
(tapping)

00:25.100 --> 00:25.932
(sighing)

00:26.085 --> 00:28.027
(dark music)

00:33.759 --> 00:34.658
(clattering)

01:19.896 --> 01:20.637
(door opening)

01:20.656 --> 01:21.321
- Federal agents, freeze!

01:21.415 --> 01:22.472
Don't touch that gun,

01:22.491 --> 01:23.373
Don't touch it!

01:26.161 --> 01:27.661
(woman): What is this,
what's going on?

01:27.813 --> 01:28.829
- Federal agents, freeze!

01:28.981 --> 01:30.163
(man): Do you see me moving?

01:30.316 --> 01:31.590
- Cuff him.
- Lorenzo, lorenzo!

01:31.817 --> 01:33.166
- Cuff him.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.593
(groaning)

01:52.446 --> 01:54.613
(eerie music)

02:06.610 --> 02:07.543
- What's this?

02:08.462 --> 02:09.711
- Your new life.

02:20.290 --> 02:22.599
- Teresa matheson.

02:24.703 --> 02:25.978
- Sign here.

02:32.969 --> 02:34.611
- You really think
you can protect me?

02:35.731 --> 02:36.738
- Haven't lost one yet.

02:49.728 --> 02:51.753
(soft music)

03:05.411 --> 03:06.185
(sighs)

03:18.257 --> 03:20.181
- Well...

03:20.275 --> 03:23.619
It's not much,
elena, but it's home.

03:42.114 --> 03:44.448
<i> - Hello?</i>

03:44.466 --> 03:45.682
<i> Hello?</i>

03:46.894 --> 03:48.977
<i> Teresa, is that you?</i>

03:54.217 --> 03:55.651
(exhaling)

04:11.085 --> 04:13.252
- We got this, right?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.423
Hey, just you and me.

04:19.318 --> 04:21.385
(soft music)

04:34.942 --> 04:37.276
- Mom, I'm home.

04:43.008 --> 04:44.116
Mom?

04:57.372 --> 04:58.630
Mom?

05:07.049 --> 05:07.806
Mom?

05:08.033 --> 05:08.882
(gasping)

05:09.034 --> 05:11.885
- Elena, I didn't
hear you come in.

05:12.037 --> 05:13.703
- Are we going somewhere?

05:13.797 --> 05:19.300
- Uh... Actually,
I need to talk to you.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.320
Let's go sit, dinner
should be ready soon.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.625
- You said you wanted to talk.

05:39.898 --> 05:41.298
- I have to go away
for a few days.

05:42.568 --> 05:44.009
You'll be alright
on your own, won't you?

05:44.419 --> 05:46.011
- Sure but what's going on?

05:46.238 --> 05:47.137
Where are you going?

05:48.240 --> 05:50.164
- I have to go home,

05:50.184 --> 05:51.350
Back where I grew up.

05:54.429 --> 06:00.007
Your grandmother
in the hospital.

06:00.027 --> 06:00.917
- Wait, what?

06:00.936 --> 06:02.268
- She's very sick

06:02.363 --> 06:04.604
And may not have much longer.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.941
- You mean grandma sofia,
did she die like a long time ago

06:08.035 --> 06:09.034
Before I was born?

06:09.945 --> 06:10.927
- That's what I told you.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.762
- So my grandmother's
still alive.

06:12.781 --> 06:14.706
- I thought I was doing
the right thing at the time.

06:15.191 --> 06:16.875
- What, why?

06:17.102 --> 06:19.795
- I'm sorry I lied,
but I wanted to protect you.

06:21.106 --> 06:22.964
- To protect me from
my own grandmother?

06:24.534 --> 06:26.051
- It's more
complicated than that.

06:26.202 --> 06:27.627
- Complicated how?

06:28.447 --> 06:29.963
Okay, well, why can't you
explain it to me?

06:30.115 --> 06:31.223
Just tell me the truth.

06:32.801 --> 06:35.543
- You have a right to know
the truth, but not now, not yet.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.561
- Why?

06:39.641 --> 06:40.732
- I need to finish packing.

06:40.959 --> 06:42.734
- When do you leave?

06:43.404 --> 06:44.736
- Early tomorrow.

06:46.131 --> 06:48.407
I'll be gone and back
before you know it.

06:48.634 --> 06:50.200
(soft music)

07:07.819 --> 07:09.502
- Have a good trip, I guess.

07:09.655 --> 07:10.929
- Bye, baby.

07:11.990 --> 07:13.098
- Bye, mom.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.351
(suitcase rolling)

07:17.496 --> 07:18.186
- Bye.

07:29.432 --> 07:30.949
(sinister music)

07:40.443 --> 07:42.018
(man): I have to remind you,
this trip goes against

07:42.037 --> 07:43.536
The advice of the federal
marshall service.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.112
- I am well aware.

07:45.207 --> 07:47.190
- Do you know that we can't
guarantee your protection once

07:47.209 --> 07:48.467
You leave here, you'll
be giving up your cover.

07:48.694 --> 07:49.526
- I know the risks.

07:49.619 --> 07:50.802
They play in
my head on a loop.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.139
You know, there's some things
in life you just have to do.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.790
I owe this to my mother.

07:55.884 --> 07:57.033
- Your mother wouldn't want you

07:57.126 --> 07:58.143
To risk your life to see her.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.272
Teresa, don't do this.

08:06.712 --> 08:08.378
- If anything
should happen to me...

08:08.471 --> 08:09.571
- Your daughter
will be taken care of.

08:27.082 --> 08:28.340
(doors closing)

08:32.904 --> 08:33.903
(suspenseful music)

08:33.922 --> 08:34.638
(gasping)

08:44.599 --> 08:46.274
(distant yelling)

08:48.678 --> 08:50.253
(dog barking)

08:50.513 --> 08:51.863
(eerie music)

08:53.700 --> 08:56.660
(distant sirens)

08:57.854 --> 08:59.204
(door closing)

09:00.448 --> 09:01.706
(engine starting)

09:02.934 --> 09:04.292
(clattering)

09:17.724 --> 09:18.723
(car beeping)

09:24.306 --> 09:25.689
(keys jingling)

09:27.550 --> 09:28.400
(distant scream)

09:34.466 --> 09:35.907
(choking)

09:49.590 --> 09:52.173
(sinister music)

10:12.854 --> 10:14.762
<i> (phone): Hi, you've reached</i>
<i> teresa, please leave a message</i>

10:14.856 --> 10:15.839
<i>And I'll get right back to you.</i>

10:15.857 --> 10:16.840
(voice mail tone)

10:16.858 --> 10:17.857
- Mom, it's me.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.284
I haven't heard from you

10:19.511 --> 10:20.601
And I'm starting
to get really worried,

10:20.695 --> 10:21.703
Please call me back.

10:23.031 --> 10:23.913
(sighing)

10:26.017 --> 10:27.959
(suspenseful music)

10:34.283 --> 10:34.966
(knocking)

10:35.193 --> 10:35.967
(gasping)

10:44.536 --> 10:45.644
Who are you?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.814
- Grant carter, us marshals
service, can I come in?

10:55.881 --> 10:57.046
- I saw you before.

10:57.732 --> 10:58.990
What do you
want with my mom?

11:00.827 --> 11:01.993
Is she in trouble?

11:02.645 --> 11:04.145
- I'm actually
here to talk to you.

11:04.572 --> 11:07.056
It's about your mother
but it would be better

11:07.075 --> 11:07.907
If I could come inside.

11:08.059 --> 11:08.667
You can keep

11:08.818 --> 11:09.834
The door open if you want.

11:13.398 --> 11:14.339
- Okay.

11:23.166 --> 11:26.351
I was about to make some coffee,
do you want some?

11:26.853 --> 11:28.186
- Sure. Thanks.

11:30.765 --> 11:32.482
- So, you said you're
a us marshal?

11:33.435 --> 11:34.526
- That's right.

11:42.185 --> 11:43.034
- So what is it?

11:44.763 --> 11:45.929
- It's about your mother.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.038
- Yeah, you already said that.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.542
Did something happen?

11:52.437 --> 11:53.044
- She was found last night.

11:55.957 --> 11:57.882
Authorities are saying
it's a homicide.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.011
- What?

12:02.948 --> 12:03.805
- I'm sorry.

12:10.713 --> 12:12.313
- She's dead?

12:13.475 --> 12:14.791
- Someone found
her at the hospital

12:14.884 --> 12:16.476
After she had visited
your grandmother.

12:16.628 --> 12:18.862
She had asphyxiated.

12:21.649 --> 12:23.241
- How could someone
do that to her?

12:25.746 --> 12:27.579
- Look, I know this is a shock,
do you want to sit?

12:27.806 --> 12:29.914
(whimpering)

12:33.253 --> 12:35.420
I don't know how much
she told you about her past

12:35.571 --> 12:37.213
And her involvement
with the marshal's office.

12:40.318 --> 12:41.484
- Her what?

12:41.503 --> 12:43.094
I...

12:45.599 --> 12:46.931
I can't.

12:48.676 --> 12:50.518
I don't want
to hear this right now.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.604
- This affects you too.

12:54.516 --> 12:56.065
- My mom is gone.

12:58.261 --> 13:00.195
I don't care
about anything else.

13:06.769 --> 13:08.119
- For when you're ready to talk.

13:10.865 --> 13:12.290
- Please just go.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.756
Get out.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.803
(crying)

14:00.065 --> 14:02.340
(soft music)

14:05.494 --> 14:07.929
How could you leave me like
this, mom?

14:11.092 --> 14:12.350
I still need you.

14:12.853 --> 14:16.354
(heavy breathing)

14:29.260 --> 14:31.369
Russo? What is this?

15:23.256 --> 15:26.315
Four valley plain teens were
involved in a two-car accident

15:26.334 --> 15:30.503
On Friday leaving one passenger
dead and another paralyzed.

15:31.598 --> 15:35.007
Track star teresa russo was
hospitalized with several broken

15:35.101 --> 15:37.769
Bones while her friend
jacqueline armstrong
was admitted

15:37.996 --> 15:40.688
With a concussion and severe
facial lacerations.

15:42.925 --> 15:44.067
Teresa russo?

16:16.701 --> 16:18.309
(suspenseful music)

16:19.128 --> 16:20.478
(rattling)

16:26.544 --> 16:27.402
(panting)

16:28.137 --> 16:29.988
(eerie music)

16:43.561 --> 16:45.169
(panting)

16:46.731 --> 16:48.172
(banging)

16:48.750 --> 16:49.749
(whimpering)

16:49.901 --> 16:50.750
Look, if you don't leave,

16:50.844 --> 16:51.676
I'm gonna call the cops.

16:54.239 --> 16:56.180
(whimpering)

17:22.100 --> 17:23.599
(banging)

17:23.618 --> 17:25.710
(panting)

17:37.465 --> 17:38.723
<i> (man): Elena?</i>

17:40.451 --> 17:41.467
- Someone's outside of my door
trying to break into my house.

17:41.619 --> 17:42.785
<i> - Find a place</i>
<i> to stay out of sight,</i>

17:42.804 --> 17:44.395
<i>I'll be there in less than ten.</i>

17:44.622 --> 17:45.396
- Okay.

17:45.623 --> 17:47.398
(whimpering)

18:08.237 --> 18:09.570
(knocking)

18:09.756 --> 18:10.755
- It's carter!

18:10.906 --> 18:12.006
(knocking)

18:14.986 --> 18:15.593
- Did you see them?

18:18.489 --> 18:19.822
- I checked
the whole neighbourhood.

18:19.841 --> 18:21.173
- Well, someone was here.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.583
- I believe you and I take all

18:22.677 --> 18:23.750
Potential threats seriously.

18:24.679 --> 18:26.062
We'll see what your neighbour's
cameras can tell us.

18:26.831 --> 18:28.013
- It's weird, right?

18:28.166 --> 18:29.181
The timing.

18:29.334 --> 18:30.182
- Could be a regular robbery

18:30.335 --> 18:31.592
Attempt or it could have

18:31.611 --> 18:32.568
Something to do with your mom.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.737
- How?

18:36.524 --> 18:38.858
- I guess teresa didn't mention
the witness protection program.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.344
- Mom was in the witness
protection program?

18:41.437 --> 18:44.455
- She was. So were you,
by default. Until now.

18:46.108 --> 18:47.583
- Until she died you mean.

18:49.778 --> 18:51.203
- Someone very dangerous
has been after your mom

18:51.297 --> 18:52.779
For the past 21 years.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.049
Last week when she went
to her hometown...

18:56.194 --> 18:57.760
- They found her
and they killed her.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.957
- So... So, you know who did it,
you can arrest them.

19:04.051 --> 19:06.293
- Possible leads, but we need
something concrete to be able

19:06.387 --> 19:08.053
To bring our case
to the us attorney.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.541
Elena, I'm concerned about
your safety, especially after

19:12.560 --> 19:13.392
Everything that happened today.

19:13.544 --> 19:14.710
I think we should find

19:14.803 --> 19:15.728
A place for you to move to.

19:15.822 --> 19:16.879
- What?

19:16.898 --> 19:17.655
What? No.

19:17.882 --> 19:18.972
I...

19:18.992 --> 19:20.140
I just lost my mom, this place

19:20.160 --> 19:21.901
Is the only thing I have left.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.886
- Please consider this.
When you're ready,

19:23.905 --> 19:25.312
We can set you up
with a new identity.

19:25.648 --> 19:27.123
- Like you did for my mom?

19:28.334 --> 19:29.667
Didn't work out so well for her.

19:34.081 --> 19:35.006
(sighing)

19:36.751 --> 19:39.402
- Alright, keep the door bolted
shut, make sure the windows

19:39.420 --> 19:41.404
Are all locked,
don't let anyone in.

19:41.422 --> 19:42.496
- You're leaving?

19:42.590 --> 19:43.756
- I have to. I'm sorry.

19:43.908 --> 19:45.349
- But I have more questions.

19:48.429 --> 19:49.270
- Do you know arbor park?

19:50.673 --> 19:52.506
Why don't you
meet me there at noon tomorrow?

19:53.418 --> 19:55.267
I'll bring your mother's file
and I'll post a car out front

19:55.420 --> 19:56.194
To watch the house tonight.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.604
- I'll be there.

19:58.756 --> 20:00.323
(suspenseful music)

20:31.956 --> 20:34.398
- Uh, you got ketchup
on your tie.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.049
- Ah, shoot.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.360
Uh...

20:39.906 --> 20:40.821
Um...

20:43.058 --> 20:43.866
As promised,

20:45.303 --> 20:47.745
Copy of your mother's witness
protection file.

20:51.476 --> 20:52.416
- There's not much here.

20:52.994 --> 20:54.234
- Yeah.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.828
Because her case
is still open,

20:55.980 --> 20:57.213
Some of the files
are classified.

21:00.651 --> 21:01.259
- What about my dad?

21:02.595 --> 21:03.427
Is he in here?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.854
Lorenzo bruno.

21:15.666 --> 21:16.607
This is him?

21:17.610 --> 21:18.359
- Yes.

21:24.675 --> 21:25.616
- Is there a photo?

21:32.183 --> 21:33.791
Is that him with my mom?

21:36.129 --> 21:39.371
Wait, are you telling me
that my mom entered

21:39.524 --> 21:42.449
Witness protection because
she testified against my father?

21:42.468 --> 21:44.284
- They were dating at the time.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.211
By all accounts,
he was volatile.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.789
Your mom did a brave
thing by testifying against him.

21:48.883 --> 21:51.309
Not a good guy,
at least back then.

21:51.460 --> 21:53.602
He was caught up with
a lot of dangerous people.

21:54.129 --> 21:55.295
- And now?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.872
- He's allegedly cleaned himself

21:56.891 --> 21:58.374
Up over the last several years.

21:58.392 --> 22:00.985
Who knows, maybe he's finally
straightened out his life.

22:02.713 --> 22:03.821
- So he's out of prison?

22:05.232 --> 22:06.949
Do you think he's the one
that killed my mom?

22:08.219 --> 22:09.160
- He's on the suspect list.

22:09.904 --> 22:11.236
- Along with who?

22:11.389 --> 22:12.079
- The other defendant.

22:13.574 --> 22:14.832
Here's a photo.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.502
Frank stefano,

22:18.729 --> 22:20.729
Notorious kingpin
of the criminal operation

22:20.748 --> 22:22.173
He and lorenzo
were running back then.

22:22.825 --> 22:24.008
- He looks mean.

22:24.569 --> 22:26.010
- Your mom helped
put him away too.

22:27.238 --> 22:28.571
- Damn, mom.

22:28.589 --> 22:30.514
- Yeah, he's still doing time,
but he has other that'll

22:30.666 --> 22:31.849
Do his dirty work for him.

22:32.577 --> 22:34.167
- Have you talked
to any of them?

22:35.262 --> 22:36.312
- Like I said before,
we're working all leads.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.608
It's not always straight
forward, my team faces
a lot of red tape.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.447
Have you given any
more thought to my offer?

22:49.535 --> 22:50.701
- Sorry.

22:53.355 --> 22:54.955
I can't do this right now.

22:56.267 --> 22:57.375
- I put a form in there.

22:58.769 --> 23:00.044
Take a look at it whenever
you're ready.

23:01.697 --> 23:03.288
All you'd have to do
is just sign if you decide

23:03.441 --> 23:04.507
You want to take the offer.

23:23.794 --> 23:25.569
(suspenseful music)

24:28.042 --> 24:29.258
(gasps)

24:51.732 --> 24:53.073
(phone ringing)

24:53.493 --> 24:54.307
- Carter.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.493
<i> (elena): You have to come.</i>

24:56.904 --> 24:57.903
- Are you okay?

24:58.055 --> 24:59.663
- Someone was here.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.499
<i> - Don't touch anything,</i>
<i> I'm on my way.</i>

25:23.097 --> 25:23.854
(sighs)

25:28.010 --> 25:28.859
How you holding up?

25:32.089 --> 25:33.030
You've reconsidered my offer?

25:38.612 --> 25:40.287
I think you'll realize
it's the right decision.

25:45.360 --> 25:46.769
This is teresa's signature.

25:46.787 --> 25:47.619
- Yeah.

25:47.713 --> 25:48.453
She signed it

25:48.606 --> 25:49.605
And look where it got her.

25:49.623 --> 25:51.790
I'm not gonna
make the same mistake.

25:51.942 --> 25:52.716
- The program works.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.702
Now, what happened to teresa
shouldn't have happened,

25:55.796 --> 25:57.279
But it was because she left
the witness protection program

25:57.298 --> 25:58.614
To return to her old life.

25:58.632 --> 25:59.965
- One time.

26:00.117 --> 26:04.562
She left once to visit her own
mother after 21 years.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.232
You should've found
a way to keep her safe.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.736
- You're right.

26:17.059 --> 26:18.576
- I do agree
with you on one thing:

26:20.079 --> 26:22.329
Whoever was after my mom
seems to be coming after me.

26:23.991 --> 26:25.249
I can't stay here.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.585
- So what's your plan?

26:27.812 --> 26:30.004
- Visit my grandmother
before it's too late.

26:32.149 --> 26:33.832
- You're going to new jersey?
- Tomorrow.

26:33.984 --> 26:35.241
I bought a plane ticket.

26:35.336 --> 26:37.928
- I can't stress to you how bad
of an idea that is.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.930
You'll be walking straight
into the lion's den.

26:40.157 --> 26:41.748
- I've already
thought it through.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.676
No one there knows me.
And besides, nobody is going

26:44.829 --> 26:46.586
To expect teresa
russo's daughter to suddenly

26:46.606 --> 26:47.420
Show up in town.

26:47.514 --> 26:48.347
- Clearly somebody knows you

26:48.499 --> 26:49.832
Well enough to be targeting you.

26:49.850 --> 26:51.275
I can't keep you safe,
do you understand that?

26:51.426 --> 26:52.517
- I just...

26:52.670 --> 26:54.186
(suspenseful music)

26:54.763 --> 26:55.613
I have to do this.

26:57.599 --> 27:00.509
I need to know who my mother
was and while I'm there,

27:00.527 --> 27:01.785
I'm gonna find her killer.

27:03.347 --> 27:05.122
I'm not bound
by red tape like you.

27:08.018 --> 27:09.126
(scoffs)

27:11.522 --> 27:12.630
- Are your people almost done?

27:13.540 --> 27:14.465
I need to pack.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.969
- Will you let me drive you
to the airport tomorrow?

27:19.805 --> 27:25.976
(mysterious music)

28:07.019 --> 28:07.685
<i> (woman): Hello?</i>

28:09.580 --> 28:10.521
Hello?

28:11.857 --> 28:14.433
<i> Look, I don't need no perverts</i>
<i> calling my--</i>

28:14.527 --> 28:15.609
<i> - Hi.</i>

28:16.921 --> 28:17.945
Is this jacqueline armstrong?

28:18.772 --> 28:20.030
- Who's asking?

28:21.608 --> 28:24.593
- My name is elena matheson,
I'm the daughter of an old

28:24.686 --> 28:26.704
Friend of yours, teresa russo.

28:26.931 --> 28:28.872
<i> - Teresa?</i>

28:29.024 --> 28:30.432
I haven't heard
from her in ages.

28:30.451 --> 28:31.858
<i> I didn't know</i>
<i> she had a daughter.</i>

28:31.877 --> 28:32.543
<i> How is she?</i>

28:34.939 --> 28:36.463
- That's actually
why I'm calling you.

28:38.125 --> 28:39.608
I'm sorry to tell you that

28:39.701 --> 28:40.959
<i> She passed away last week.</i>

28:41.053 --> 28:42.219
- Oh.

28:43.113 --> 28:43.887
Now that's a shame.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.467
<i> I wish we could have</i>
<i> gotten together again,</i>

28:48.619 --> 28:50.561
<i> For old time's sake.</i>

28:52.623 --> 28:53.805
- Do you still live
in valley plain?

28:53.899 --> 28:54.881
(scoffs)

28:54.900 --> 28:55.974
- At this point,

28:56.126 --> 28:57.401
I'm never getting out.

28:58.295 --> 28:58.810
- I'm flying there tomorrow.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.553
- Oh!

29:00.573 --> 29:01.797
Well, you should come by for
a visit,

29:01.815 --> 29:02.573
<i> Where are you staying?</i>

29:04.893 --> 29:06.392
- I'll probably
just get a rental place.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.652
<i> - Ah, nonsense.</i>

29:07.805 --> 29:09.729
You can stay here.
I mean, it's nothing fancy,

29:09.823 --> 29:11.039
<i> But I've got a room to spare.</i>

29:12.234 --> 29:15.310
- That's really
nice of you, jacqueline.

29:15.329 --> 29:16.995
<i> - Well, teresa was</i>
<i> my best friend.</i>

29:17.089 --> 29:18.981
It's the least I can do.

29:19.074 --> 29:21.425
And please, call me jackie.

29:22.410 --> 29:24.762
(soft music)

29:29.493 --> 29:30.267
(sighs)

29:31.270 --> 29:32.770
- Here, let me help you.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.773
- Oh, I'm good.

29:38.335 --> 29:39.351
- You sure about this?

29:39.445 --> 29:41.019
- Yes. I'm sure.

29:42.114 --> 29:45.007
- Elena, please understand
that my hands are tied.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.266
I wish it could be different

29:46.285 --> 29:47.509
But my boss won't allow me to be

29:47.602 --> 29:48.360
Your handler once you leave.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.511
I won't be able

29:49.530 --> 29:50.287
To guarantee your safety.

29:51.439 --> 29:52.956
- You couldn't
guarantee it anyway.

29:54.184 --> 29:54.875
- Wait.

29:59.039 --> 30:00.047
Where will you be staying?

30:01.467 --> 30:02.949
- With my mom's old friend,
jacqueline armstrong.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.193
- Will you at least check in
with me when you get there?

30:05.287 --> 30:06.545
Just a text to let me know
you're safe.

30:06.639 --> 30:07.620
- Fine.

30:07.640 --> 30:08.288
- And the address

30:08.382 --> 30:09.956
Of where you're staying.

30:09.975 --> 30:11.225
And her licence plate number.

30:12.886 --> 30:14.144
Actually, if you could text me
once a day, that would be great.

30:14.296 --> 30:15.479
(chuckles)

30:16.874 --> 30:17.815
- We're gonna be late.

30:18.876 --> 30:19.650
- Ah.

30:23.397 --> 30:27.658
(mysterious music)

30:34.667 --> 30:37.501
(city hubbub)

30:55.855 --> 30:57.521
(eerie music)

31:04.088 --> 31:05.270
(gasp)

31:05.364 --> 31:06.363
- Elena!

31:06.590 --> 31:07.923
Is that you?

31:07.941 --> 31:09.199
- Yeah, hi.

31:10.110 --> 31:11.702
- Hi. I'm jackie.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.096
Come on, come on.

31:14.598 --> 31:17.207
Oh my gosh, look at you!

31:17.359 --> 31:18.950
- Oh...
- Here let me take that--

31:19.103 --> 31:20.769
- Oh, it's really--
- oh, no, I insist.

31:20.787 --> 31:22.362
- Oh.
- Okay, thanks.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.624
Okay, well...
Okay, come on, let's go.

31:25.776 --> 31:27.050
Ooh, you got a lot of stuff.

31:27.945 --> 31:29.219
Welcome.

31:29.613 --> 31:31.371
(chuckling)

31:31.390 --> 31:33.390
Sit, sit, sit.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.134
You must be starving.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.045
- Oh, well--
- I made my famous meatloaf,

31:39.139 --> 31:40.472
Everyone loves it.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.308
Oh, it's nice and hot.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.568
(sighs)

31:44.719 --> 31:47.321
Okay, here we are...

31:49.557 --> 31:51.241
There it is.

31:52.578 --> 31:55.320
Okay, you've got hot,
you've got cold, you're all set.

31:55.414 --> 31:56.580
(sighing)

31:56.807 --> 31:57.581
- Thank you.

31:57.808 --> 31:59.249
(chuckling)

31:59.476 --> 32:01.084
- I couldn't believe
it when you called.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.254
Yeah... But now that you're
here, you have to tell me

32:04.481 --> 32:06.924
Everything about teresa.
I mean, god rest her.

32:07.985 --> 32:09.742
We were inseparable growing up.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.597
Always had big plans
to get out of this town but...

32:13.748 --> 32:15.840
Of course, teresa was
the one to finally do it.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.250
(laughing)

32:17.937 --> 32:19.770
I often wondered where she went,

32:19.997 --> 32:22.013
I felt like she fell off
the face of the earth.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.607
- Oh...

32:23.758 --> 32:24.683
We've been in ohio.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.168
- Ohio?

32:26.186 --> 32:28.111
Why would she go there?

32:28.338 --> 32:29.863
- I don't think
she had much of a choice.

32:34.787 --> 32:37.195
Mom was in witness
protection because of something

32:37.347 --> 32:39.122
That happened before I was born.

32:40.017 --> 32:42.042
I didn't even know about
any of this until she...

32:42.795 --> 32:43.961
Died.

32:45.706 --> 32:49.800
- Wait a sec, is this because of
that trial where she testified?

32:50.027 --> 32:50.709
- Yeah.

32:50.803 --> 32:51.710
(gasping)

32:51.804 --> 32:53.528
- That's crazy!

32:53.547 --> 32:56.381
You mean you didn't know
anything about your family

32:56.475 --> 32:58.642
Or your mother's last name
or any stuff like that?

32:58.869 --> 32:59.884
- I've never even met
my grandmother--

32:59.979 --> 33:00.811
- Oh.

33:01.038 --> 33:01.478
- And...

33:02.797 --> 33:04.147
I hear she's not doing too well.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.817
- Sweet sofia.

33:08.045 --> 33:10.612
I heard she's over
at greenpoint hospital.

33:11.657 --> 33:12.990
We can go visit
her if you'd like.

33:13.826 --> 33:14.883
(clears throat)

33:15.310 --> 33:16.326
What's the matter?

33:17.830 --> 33:18.996
- I...

33:21.241 --> 33:24.334
It just hit me all of
a sudden that she's so close.

33:26.730 --> 33:29.322
- I get it,
it's a lot to take in.

33:30.067 --> 33:32.083
I'll tell you what,
why don't you finish eating

33:32.177 --> 33:34.736
And then I'll show you to your
room, you can get some rest,

33:34.755 --> 33:36.571
And we can talk
more in the morning.

33:37.424 --> 33:38.765
- Thank you for everything,
jackie.

33:40.093 --> 33:41.501
- Are you kidding?

33:42.412 --> 33:44.688
There's nothing I wouldn't
do for teresa.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.752
Eat, it's good.

33:50.771 --> 33:51.770
It'll make you feel good.

33:51.864 --> 33:53.755
It makes me feel good.

33:53.774 --> 33:55.198
(laughing)

33:55.425 --> 33:56.867
(soft music)

34:10.049 --> 34:11.882
(shaky breathing)

34:12.109 --> 34:12.883
Hey.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.052
You okay?

34:17.631 --> 34:19.614
- I'm just starting to
realize that to my grandmother,

34:19.633 --> 34:23.060
I'm a complete stranger. And I
know she's really sick but...

34:24.471 --> 34:26.638
What if my going in there
just gives her a shock so bad

34:26.790 --> 34:27.898
That it'll kill her?

34:28.049 --> 34:30.734
- Oh, honey,
sofia's a tough one.

34:31.978 --> 34:34.154
I think she'll be overjoyed
to see you.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.406
- No.

34:37.484 --> 34:38.909
No, I can't do this.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.661
- That's okay.

34:43.398 --> 34:46.991
If you're not ready now, we can
come back another time, okay?

34:47.811 --> 34:50.236
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go, come on.

34:50.330 --> 34:50.921
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

34:53.166 --> 34:55.258
It's okay, we'll come back
another time.

35:05.604 --> 35:06.494
- Where are we?

35:06.588 --> 35:08.330
- It's your grandmother's house,

35:08.423 --> 35:09.497
It's where your mom grew up.

35:10.684 --> 35:12.834
- Aw... There's that picture
of you and my mom standing

35:12.853 --> 35:14.018
On the lawn as teenagers.

35:14.113 --> 35:14.945
- Mm-hmm.

35:15.522 --> 35:16.688
- So who lives there now?

35:17.783 --> 35:19.950
- Oh, sofia still owns
it, but I don't think anyone's

35:20.177 --> 35:22.619
Staying there while
she's in the hospital.

35:25.515 --> 35:26.373
Come on.

35:30.187 --> 35:31.128
- Where are you going?

35:34.191 --> 35:36.716
What? Uh...

35:46.203 --> 35:46.977
- Ah.

35:48.205 --> 35:48.895
- I don't think
we should be here.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.231
- Don't worry,

35:52.634 --> 35:54.818
Sofia used to keep
a spare key hidden out here.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.395
- Are you crazy?

35:57.547 --> 35:58.405
- Relax.

36:00.642 --> 36:03.218
I think if you could inside
the house it would help you

36:03.311 --> 36:04.494
Get to know your grandmother.

36:06.072 --> 36:08.582
Then you might feel more
comfortable visiting her, okay?

36:13.988 --> 36:16.414
Key's gotta be here somewhere.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.091
(groaning)

36:19.845 --> 36:21.069
(meowing)

36:21.087 --> 36:22.086
(gasping)

36:22.239 --> 36:23.013
- Oh.

36:27.093 --> 36:29.186
Hey there, kitty.

36:30.747 --> 36:31.596
Jackie.

36:31.690 --> 36:32.355
- What?

36:33.358 --> 36:34.858
Someone's been feeding the cat.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.281
- It's fine,
don't worry so much.

36:42.517 --> 36:43.617
- Jackie...

36:51.601 --> 36:53.210
- You're right, we should leave.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.049
Let's go!

36:59.276 --> 37:00.050
(sighing)

37:02.221 --> 37:05.055
(eerie music)

37:19.629 --> 37:20.904
- I'm trying to avoid breaking

37:21.131 --> 37:22.555
And entering here,
can't you help?

37:22.574 --> 37:24.557
- I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.134
- There's gotta be a way
to remotely access someone's

37:26.152 --> 37:26.826
Recorded video footage.

37:28.138 --> 37:29.971
I figured you feds
must know how to do that.

37:30.064 --> 37:32.140
- Elena, you need to stay
away from that house.

37:32.158 --> 37:34.642
- I know, that's why I'm trying
to do this remotely.

37:34.661 --> 37:36.494
- Forget about that for
a minute, this is dangerous.

37:36.646 --> 37:38.237
<i> Anyone could be waiting</i>
<i> for you there.</i>

37:38.257 --> 37:39.664
- No one has a clue I'm here.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.741
<i> - Don't be naive, elena,</i>
<i> someone broke into your house.</i>

37:41.760 --> 37:44.261
It is possible, even likely,
they know where you are.

37:45.155 --> 37:46.746
- Look, if you're telling
me that there's not a way

37:46.765 --> 37:48.748
To remotely access those
cameras, then I'll just have

37:48.842 --> 37:50.174
<i> To go in there</i>
<i> to see for myself.</i>

37:50.327 --> 37:52.176
- No, that's
not what I'm saying.

37:52.329 --> 37:53.085
- Don't you get it?

37:53.105 --> 37:54.496
This is my mom's childhood home,

37:54.514 --> 37:55.921
<i>For all we know, she went there</i>

37:55.941 --> 37:57.089
That last day and that footage

37:57.109 --> 37:59.517
Could tell us if anyone
one was with her.

37:59.669 --> 38:01.352
- I hear what you're saying,
but there's an official way

38:01.505 --> 38:02.612
These things should be done.

38:03.097 --> 38:04.281
- You and your red tape.

38:06.100 --> 38:06.950
- Elena...

38:07.861 --> 38:09.119
(sighs)

38:23.785 --> 38:24.634
(knocking)

38:26.287 --> 38:26.970
- Come in.

38:30.550 --> 38:31.533
- You doing okay?

38:31.551 --> 38:32.726
- Yeah.

38:35.555 --> 38:36.980
- That was a great day.

38:37.874 --> 38:40.892
We ditched our last class
and went to the movies.

38:41.044 --> 38:44.654
We snuck into dangerous minds
and ate our weight in candy.

38:44.881 --> 38:46.239
(chuckling)

38:47.475 --> 38:48.974
- Can I ask you something?

38:48.994 --> 38:49.909
- Shoot.

38:51.404 --> 38:53.721
- I was thinking and,
you were right, it would be good

38:53.815 --> 38:55.999
For me to get inside
of my grandmother's house.

38:56.226 --> 38:58.651
I do want to try
to get to know who she is.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.837
Is there any way you might know
of another way in?

39:02.082 --> 39:03.414
- I don't know.

39:03.567 --> 39:05.508
I didn't realize before
that there would be cameras.

39:05.660 --> 39:08.236
- Yeah, but the cameras
could be a lot of help to us.

39:08.905 --> 39:11.072
Maybe they picked up something
that could show me what happened

39:11.091 --> 39:13.850
To my mom, like someone
following her.

39:16.079 --> 39:18.980
- I do know of one other way
through a basement window...

39:20.433 --> 39:22.192
At least that's what we used
to use back in the day.

39:23.344 --> 39:24.361
- It isn't locked?

39:25.530 --> 39:27.438
- The latch
was busted back then.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.108
I used to help teresa sneak
through there whenever

39:30.260 --> 39:31.701
We'd be out past curfew.

39:32.186 --> 39:33.328
Could be worth a shot.

39:34.764 --> 39:35.947
- Can I borrow your car?

39:36.541 --> 39:39.450
- Ugh, keys
are hanging by the door,

39:39.544 --> 39:41.102
Don't tell me when you leave,

39:41.121 --> 39:42.879
I don't need
to know anything about it.

39:46.868 --> 39:47.775
(car door closing)

39:48.111 --> 39:49.386
(suspenseful music)

40:21.253 --> 40:22.252
(alarm sounding)

40:22.479 --> 40:23.420
(suspenseful music)

40:53.009 --> 40:54.075
- Come on...

41:10.802 --> 41:14.220
(sirens blaring)

41:19.385 --> 41:21.269
(tires screeching)

41:51.343 --> 41:52.967
(distant dog barking)

41:54.829 --> 41:57.639
I can't believe you're here.
Thanks for bailing me out.

42:00.001 --> 42:02.093
Aren't you going
to say something?

42:02.929 --> 42:05.079
For god's sake, can you
just say something already?

42:05.098 --> 42:06.748
- Do you need me
to tell you how reckless

42:06.766 --> 42:08.173
That stunt was that you pulled?

42:08.193 --> 42:09.600
- I wouldn't call that a stunt.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.603
- How it cost you whatever
anonymity you had and revealed

42:12.756 --> 42:14.864
Your blatant lack of concern
not only for yourself but also

42:15.016 --> 42:16.533
For your friend jacqueline
and for me.

42:18.428 --> 42:19.351
- I'm sorry.

42:19.371 --> 42:20.778
- You're not my only case,
you know?

42:20.930 --> 42:22.930
But you're the only one
I have to drop everything

42:22.949 --> 42:24.282
For and get on a flight
to new jersey!

42:24.434 --> 42:25.858
- I'm not your case at all.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.026
I left the program, remember?

42:27.045 --> 42:28.286
- I remember.

42:28.380 --> 42:30.713
(distant sirens)

42:32.551 --> 42:33.383
(sighs)

42:35.779 --> 42:39.347
I made a promise to your mother,
to always look out for you.

42:41.876 --> 42:42.892
So here I am

42:46.398 --> 42:48.231
I'm driving you back
to jacqueline's for the night.

43:24.436 --> 43:26.060
- What?

43:26.663 --> 43:27.103
(sighs)

43:27.330 --> 43:31.232
(suspenseful music)

43:41.527 --> 43:42.368
(gasping)

43:50.370 --> 43:52.462
Is that hair...
Is that my mom's hair?

43:55.875 --> 43:57.358
- Change of plans.

43:57.377 --> 43:58.784
You're leaving with me.

43:58.878 --> 44:00.027
We'll get the next flight home.

44:00.046 --> 44:01.712
- But... I'm not leaving.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.381
- There's been two obvious
threats made against you,

44:03.533 --> 44:05.383
Three if you count that person
lurking around your front door.

44:06.035 --> 44:07.292
You just got arrested
and you're staying

44:07.312 --> 44:08.144
With a woman you barely know.

44:08.295 --> 44:08.886
- My mom knew her,

44:09.038 --> 44:09.962
That's enough for me.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.272
- Your mother also knew killers!

44:12.058 --> 44:12.774
(sighing)

44:14.301 --> 44:14.776
I'm sorry.

44:16.212 --> 44:17.320
I'm just worried about you.

44:17.547 --> 44:18.971
I want you
to come back with me now

44:18.990 --> 44:20.156
So we can arrange a fresh start.

44:21.567 --> 44:23.117
- And I want to go back inside.

44:45.909 --> 44:48.184
(suspenseful music)

44:55.752 --> 44:58.528
- Sorry, I tried to quit,
but I just get so nervous

44:58.679 --> 44:59.654
With these things.

45:03.868 --> 45:05.259
- The house is clear.

45:05.278 --> 45:07.611
- Now will you
tell me what's going on?

45:07.764 --> 45:08.871
- Show her the note.

45:09.023 --> 45:09.855
- What note?

45:09.874 --> 45:11.115
- It's confidential evidence.

45:11.267 --> 45:12.116
I'd still feel better

45:12.210 --> 45:12.934
If you'd come with me.

45:12.952 --> 45:14.769
- Oh, no, no, no.

45:14.862 --> 45:17.362
Elena's on her own journey,
she needs answers.

45:17.457 --> 45:19.698
- I'm sorry for what happened
today and I apologize

45:19.792 --> 45:20.958
For bringing you
all the way out here.

45:21.110 --> 45:22.944
I...

45:22.962 --> 45:24.462
I realized I haven't been
going about things the right

45:24.614 --> 45:26.180
Way but I do need more time.

45:26.891 --> 45:28.115
- What about tonight?

45:28.134 --> 45:29.708
- We'll lock all
the doors and the windows

45:29.802 --> 45:30.801
And won't let anybody in.

45:30.954 --> 45:32.377
- Good plan.

45:32.472 --> 45:33.896
Do you have a couch
I can crash on?

45:34.123 --> 45:34.814
- Sure.

45:35.641 --> 45:37.049
- You're gonna sleep here?

45:37.643 --> 45:39.218
- You need a toothbrush
or anything?

45:39.237 --> 45:40.719
- I have what I need.

45:40.739 --> 45:41.979
You got me out here, now I have

45:42.131 --> 45:43.156
To make sure you stay safe.

45:46.578 --> 45:47.635
- I'll make us dinner.

45:47.653 --> 45:48.486
- Sounds great.

45:48.580 --> 45:49.637
- I'll help you.

45:49.730 --> 45:51.164
- Okay, why don't
you go get settled?

46:02.485 --> 46:04.168
- Jackie...

46:04.262 --> 46:06.504
With everything that's going on,

46:06.656 --> 46:09.507
I completely understand if you
don't want me staying here.

46:09.659 --> 46:10.674
I'll leave any time.

46:10.827 --> 46:11.917
- Absolutely not. I meant it

46:11.936 --> 46:13.661
When I said I wanted to help.

46:13.846 --> 46:15.271
Anything for teresa's daughter.

46:18.167 --> 46:19.942
- When I went
to my grandmother's house,

46:20.094 --> 46:21.736
I found something
that I want to show you.

46:26.785 --> 46:28.025
Do you know who this is?

46:28.119 --> 46:29.268
(dramatic music)

46:29.287 --> 46:32.622
- That's lorenzo bruno, your--

46:32.773 --> 46:34.290
- My father.

46:37.278 --> 46:39.854
- He and my mom had a
confrontation the day she died.

46:39.872 --> 46:41.872
I think he had something
to do with her death.

46:42.634 --> 46:44.133
I think that he's wanted revenge

46:44.360 --> 46:46.360
Ever since my mom testified
against him.

46:46.879 --> 46:48.362
What do you know
about the trial?

46:48.807 --> 46:50.890
- Oh, well, I was there.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.813
Your mother was the star witness
for the prosecution.

46:57.631 --> 46:59.965
The jury found her sympathetic
because she was emotional

46:59.984 --> 47:01.725
And visibly pregnant.

47:02.211 --> 47:04.303
Hey, you know what?

47:04.322 --> 47:06.322
Technically, you were there too.

47:06.473 --> 47:07.448
(chuckling)

47:08.660 --> 47:09.900
- Carter says that maybe lorenzo

47:09.994 --> 47:11.977
Changed after all these years.

47:11.996 --> 47:13.496
Do you think that could be true?

47:13.647 --> 47:15.581
- Honestly?

47:17.318 --> 47:19.293
I think you can change
the suit but not the man.

47:21.673 --> 47:23.005
Ready?

47:29.163 --> 47:31.180
(mysterious music)

47:51.444 --> 47:52.869
(sighing)

48:30.891 --> 48:32.057
(creaking)

48:32.076 --> 48:32.983
(thud)

48:33.077 --> 48:34.076
(gasps)

48:42.645 --> 48:43.402
- Freeze!

48:43.829 --> 48:45.588
Stand up, slowly.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.175
- Which is it,
freeze or stand up?

48:50.261 --> 48:51.093
(sighs)

48:51.245 --> 48:51.986
- I'm sorry.

48:52.079 --> 48:53.387
I was sleeping pretty hard.

48:54.490 --> 48:56.515
I thought someone broke in.

48:57.843 --> 48:58.893
Let me have one of those.

49:07.670 --> 49:11.930
- So, I was doing some
research online and came
across lorenzo's company.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.449
They're real estate developers

49:13.676 --> 49:14.766
And it looks
like they're hiring.

49:14.860 --> 49:15.676
So I thought I'd apply,

49:15.769 --> 49:17.269
See if I can get an interview

49:17.363 --> 49:17.954
And guess what?

49:18.105 --> 49:18.770
- You did.

49:18.864 --> 49:19.847
- Interview's tomorrow.

49:19.865 --> 49:21.532
- Are you nuts?

49:21.626 --> 49:23.275
- I thought you might want
to give me a ride.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.019
- No! This is a terrible plan,

49:25.037 --> 49:26.629
It invites trouble to find you!

49:27.356 --> 49:28.965
Look, I'm doing
what I can to keep you safe,

49:29.192 --> 49:30.357
But every minute
you're out of the program,

49:30.376 --> 49:31.525
Your life is on the line!

49:31.544 --> 49:32.635
- Look.

49:34.380 --> 49:35.696
- Is that lorenzo?

49:35.789 --> 49:37.789
- Yeah. He was at my
grandmother's house harassing

49:37.809 --> 49:39.291
My mom the day she was killed.

49:39.869 --> 49:40.884
You need evidence, right?

49:40.979 --> 49:42.703
Something to prove it was him?

49:42.722 --> 49:44.872
Well, all I'd have to do
is gain access to his office,

49:44.965 --> 49:46.557
Take a peek at his schedule,

49:46.709 --> 49:47.966
Maybe his location history
on his phone.

49:47.986 --> 49:49.801
That way we could at least prove

49:49.895 --> 49:51.654
Whether or not he was at
the hospital during that time.

49:53.232 --> 49:54.657
Stop shaking your head.

49:56.886 --> 50:00.571
I wish I could get past
this but I can't.

50:00.723 --> 50:02.556
My mom was all I had.

50:02.575 --> 50:06.002
After she died I found out that
everything I knew was a lie.

50:07.005 --> 50:08.629
I need to find out the truth.

50:12.844 --> 50:16.253
- Maybe we can work together,
but you have to be careful.

50:16.405 --> 50:18.405
Don't take any
unnecessary risks.

50:18.424 --> 50:19.682
Can you promise me that?
- Yes.

50:21.519 --> 50:23.761
- That feeling in your gut...

50:23.855 --> 50:24.687
Trust it.

50:26.766 --> 50:27.773
And I'll give you a ride.

50:36.850 --> 50:38.868
(mysterious music)

50:43.099 --> 50:44.540
(panting)

50:59.039 --> 51:00.464
- Are you looking
for the receptionist?

51:00.616 --> 51:01.298
- Yeah.

51:01.450 --> 51:02.800
- She should be right back.

51:02.952 --> 51:03.893
- Thanks.

51:05.288 --> 51:06.395
- Here you go, have a good one.

51:07.290 --> 51:08.564
Bye.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.029
Do you want to order
a coffee while you wait?

51:20.244 --> 51:24.305
- I shouldn't,
I'm here for a job interview

51:24.323 --> 51:26.064
And I'm already nervous enough.

51:26.158 --> 51:28.066
- Okay, let me guess...

51:28.160 --> 51:29.660
Administrative assistant?

51:29.812 --> 51:30.878
- No.

51:31.831 --> 51:32.588
- Engineer?

51:32.739 --> 51:33.664
(chuckles)

51:33.816 --> 51:34.665
- No.

51:34.817 --> 51:35.925
- Uh...

51:36.076 --> 51:37.093
Marketing department?

51:37.320 --> 51:38.094
- Mailroom.

51:39.322 --> 51:40.262
- Okay, mailroom's the best.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.175
Seriously, there's a great group
of people down there.

51:45.328 --> 51:48.270
And hey, we all got to get our
foot in the door somehow, hm?

51:50.108 --> 51:51.682
I'm allie by the way.

51:51.834 --> 51:52.608
- Elena.

51:53.778 --> 51:55.002
How long have
you been working here?

51:55.095 --> 51:57.688
- Just a few months.
Only part-time, though.

51:57.840 --> 52:00.190
The rest of the time I take
classes over at the college.

52:00.284 --> 52:01.608
- Oh, she's back.

52:01.861 --> 52:03.119
Hey.

52:03.770 --> 52:04.745
Good luck.

52:18.136 --> 52:19.135
- Are you gonna wish me luck?

52:19.362 --> 52:21.119
- I'm gonna remind
you of your promise.

52:21.213 --> 52:22.212
Now remember to call me--

52:22.365 --> 52:23.973
- If I feel threatened.

52:25.701 --> 52:26.475
Got it.

52:28.295 --> 52:29.311
- Alright.

52:38.990 --> 52:39.822
Go on.

52:41.141 --> 52:43.826
(mysterious music)

53:10.021 --> 53:12.021
- Seventh floor...

53:37.957 --> 53:39.548
(suspenseful music)

53:53.305 --> 53:55.213
I have mail for mr. Bruno.

53:55.233 --> 53:57.641
- No one enters mr. Bruno's
office without an appointment.

53:58.236 --> 53:59.902
Especially not someone
from the mail room.

54:07.987 --> 54:08.744
Is that it?

54:11.974 --> 54:13.415
- Here's that file.

54:13.642 --> 54:15.084
Tell allison to double-check
the numbers.

54:17.646 --> 54:19.255
(indistinct chatter)

54:29.082 --> 54:30.599
(suspenseful music)

54:31.918 --> 54:33.343
- Oh, you idiot.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.104
Get it together.

54:49.936 --> 54:51.412
You've been quiet
the whole drive.

54:52.848 --> 54:53.622
How'd it go?

54:55.108 --> 54:56.292
- I saw him today...

54:58.354 --> 54:59.295
Lorenzo.

55:01.299 --> 55:03.448
I thought I was prepared
but it was just so sudden

55:03.467 --> 55:06.026
And he was just...

55:06.045 --> 55:07.711
There and...

55:07.805 --> 55:09.788
I probably drew too much
attention to myself staring

55:09.807 --> 55:10.639
At him like an idiot.

55:10.866 --> 55:11.956
- No.

55:12.051 --> 55:13.200
Probably feels worse than

55:13.218 --> 55:14.034
It was because you've been

55:14.127 --> 55:15.311
Playing it over in your head.

55:16.722 --> 55:17.980
Did he recognize you?
- No.

55:18.557 --> 55:19.815
No, at least there's that.

55:21.560 --> 55:23.894
- But his assistant is going to
be a major road block for us,

55:24.046 --> 55:24.945
She's like a guard dog.

55:26.565 --> 55:28.640
- Then you'll have to get into
his office when she's not there.

55:28.734 --> 55:30.451
(suspenseful music)

55:41.397 --> 55:43.063
You know, you don't have
to do this right now?

55:43.566 --> 55:45.090
Especially not after
the day you've had.

55:45.734 --> 55:46.508
- I'm okay.

55:59.748 --> 56:01.081
- Hi!

56:01.100 --> 56:02.507
I...

56:02.526 --> 56:04.342
Do you remember me from work?

56:04.436 --> 56:07.421
- Of course, gosh, hey!

56:07.439 --> 56:08.105
Congrats on getting the job.

56:08.257 --> 56:09.365
- Thanks.

56:09.867 --> 56:11.108
Do you work here too?

56:11.260 --> 56:13.110
- Yeah, I intern here part time

56:13.204 --> 56:15.537
For school credit. And some
day, I'll be a nurse.

56:16.281 --> 56:17.206
- That's great.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.043
- Are you, um, visiting someone?

56:22.380 --> 56:24.171
- Yeah, kind of.

56:25.883 --> 56:30.110
My grandmother is sick
but I've never actually met her

56:30.129 --> 56:33.280
But I really want
to go and visit her.

56:33.298 --> 56:35.849
I'm just afraid that
the shock might be too much.

56:36.619 --> 56:38.301
- Hm.

56:38.454 --> 56:39.953
You want some friendly advice?

56:39.972 --> 56:41.471
- Yeah, please.

56:41.565 --> 56:42.789
- Go see her.

56:42.883 --> 56:44.400
People are
stronger than you think.

56:46.219 --> 56:48.219
Look, I mean, if you're not
feeling ready for it,

56:48.239 --> 56:49.238
I can check in
on your grandmother

56:49.389 --> 56:50.555
The next time I come in.

56:50.649 --> 56:52.574
I can text you and let
you know how she's doing.

56:53.469 --> 56:54.410
- You would do that?

56:54.561 --> 56:56.394
- Sure, it's no problem.

56:56.488 --> 56:57.246
Give me your phone.

57:03.254 --> 57:05.087
Alright, there.

57:05.314 --> 57:08.757
You have my number
and now I have yours.

57:11.244 --> 57:12.653
I can't thank
you enough for this.

57:12.671 --> 57:13.929
- Any time.

57:14.156 --> 57:15.931
I'll see you at work, okay?
- Yeah.

57:24.333 --> 57:25.399
Don't start.

57:39.457 --> 57:40.363
(glass breaking)

57:40.458 --> 57:41.439
(gasping)

57:41.459 --> 57:42.624
(eerie music)

57:47.298 --> 57:48.130
- What the...

57:49.800 --> 57:50.632
Let me.

57:56.548 --> 57:57.806
- What is that?

57:58.884 --> 58:00.726
(heavy breathing)

58:15.384 --> 58:17.826
"don't make the same mistake
your mom made."

58:18.737 --> 58:20.478
- I saw him, I saw him!

58:20.498 --> 58:24.391
I was taking the trash and...
I... I saw the bastard

58:24.409 --> 58:26.560
That threw it and I chased him
down the street but he jumped

58:26.578 --> 58:27.394
The fence and I lost him!

58:27.487 --> 58:28.745
- Well, did you see his face?

58:28.897 --> 58:30.172
- No, he had a hoodie pulled up.

58:31.083 --> 58:31.840
What's that?

58:34.327 --> 58:36.327
- "you're a smash
at your new job but that

58:36.421 --> 58:37.679
Disguise isn't fooling anyone."

58:39.165 --> 58:40.516
- Time to move.
We need to leave.

58:40.743 --> 58:41.742
- Leave, what?
No, what about jackie?

58:41.760 --> 58:43.260
- Don't worry about me.

58:43.412 --> 58:44.836
- Gut check, you made a promise.

58:44.930 --> 58:45.746
- Jackie, I really--

58:45.839 --> 58:46.913
- No, the most important thing

58:46.932 --> 58:49.082
Is your safety, just go,
I'll be fine.

58:49.101 --> 58:51.251
- Grab what you need for work
tomorrow, we'll come back for

58:51.344 --> 58:52.102
The rest of your stuff later.

58:52.254 --> 58:53.195
- Go.

59:09.362 --> 59:10.604
- Things are getting worse.

59:11.215 --> 59:13.031
That brick is the last straw.

59:13.050 --> 59:15.959
We'll get rooms at this motel
for now but we don't have
a lot of time.

59:16.053 --> 59:18.036
I need to identify this threat
and take it out.

59:18.055 --> 59:19.780
- Don't you think if
this person wanted to kill me,

59:19.873 --> 59:20.630
They would have done it already?

59:20.724 --> 59:21.615
- That the theory you're

59:21.708 --> 59:22.799
Willing to stake your life on?

59:22.893 --> 59:25.619
- Well, I'm--
- psychopaths are like cats,

59:25.712 --> 59:27.729
Some like to play
with their prey before
they make their kill.

59:27.881 --> 59:29.565
- Now it's a psychopath?

59:29.716 --> 59:31.625
- I'm no profiler,
but just look at the facts.

59:31.643 --> 59:33.902
Those little notes?
Pure egocentrism,

59:34.129 --> 59:35.962
Aggressive arrogance,
impulsivity--

59:35.981 --> 59:37.647
- It's obviously lorenzo.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.074
- We don't know that for sure!

59:40.652 --> 59:42.060
- I just...

59:42.079 --> 59:44.321
I just hate that I have
to leave jackie like that.

59:44.415 --> 59:46.248
- Jackie will be fine,
you're the one they're after.

59:46.399 --> 59:47.583
With you out of the house,

59:47.810 --> 59:49.418
Jackie won't be
in danger anymore.

59:50.662 --> 59:51.978
Maybe this will
finally convince you not

59:52.072 --> 59:53.571
To let your guard
down with new people.

59:53.665 --> 59:54.923
- Let my guard down?

59:55.150 --> 59:56.240
- Giving your number
to strangers like

59:56.335 --> 59:57.408
That girl at the hospital?

59:57.502 --> 59:59.094
- She wasn't a stranger,
I met her at work.

1:00:01.265 --> 1:00:03.824
- You didn't think to mention
that coincidence before?

1:00:03.917 --> 1:00:05.325
A girl from lorenzo's office

1:00:05.418 --> 1:00:07.436
Just happened to be at the
hospital the same time as you?

1:00:07.587 --> 1:00:09.087
- You really think they could
both be involved?

1:00:09.106 --> 1:00:09.938
- Yes!

1:00:11.667 --> 1:00:13.166
In order for me to keep you
safe, I need you to not tell

1:00:13.185 --> 1:00:16.019
Anyone, not jackie, not that
girl from work, where you'll be

1:00:16.171 --> 1:00:17.279
Staying, do you understand that?

1:00:18.115 --> 1:00:19.615
- Yes.

1:00:21.360 --> 1:00:22.868
- I need you to cut off contact
with both of them, completely.

1:00:25.013 --> 1:00:26.622
Only until we figure out
who's behind this.

1:00:27.349 --> 1:00:28.457
Deal?

1:00:32.463 --> 1:00:33.295
- Fine.

1:00:35.466 --> 1:00:37.633
- Now come on,
let's go get some rooms.

1:00:39.303 --> 1:00:40.636
(mysterious music)

1:01:20.419 --> 1:01:23.011
(suspenseful music)

1:01:27.259 --> 1:01:28.016
- 7:40!

1:02:03.554 --> 1:02:06.054
Okay...

1:02:06.281 --> 1:02:07.630
Calendar...

1:02:07.783 --> 1:02:09.391
Come on.

1:02:11.787 --> 1:02:13.061
Yes!

1:02:13.288 --> 1:02:15.564
4:15 train to new jersey,
gotcha.

1:02:25.300 --> 1:02:27.225
- And if you get in a bind,
you can call me.

1:02:27.244 --> 1:02:28.744
- Don't worry, I can handle it.

1:02:30.806 --> 1:02:32.639
- Just doing my rounds.

1:02:33.308 --> 1:02:34.583
- You're new here, aren't you?

1:02:35.085 --> 1:02:35.917
- Uh...

1:02:37.421 --> 1:02:39.662
This elena, she started
in the mailroom last week.

1:02:40.649 --> 1:02:42.591
- I try to make a point
of meeting all new hires,

1:02:42.818 --> 1:02:44.259
I like to know who I have
working for me.

1:02:45.487 --> 1:02:46.653
- How nice.

1:02:46.746 --> 1:02:47.912
- I usually ask my assistant

1:02:48.006 --> 1:02:49.322
To schedule new employees

1:02:49.415 --> 1:02:50.581
For a meet-and-great with me.

1:02:50.675 --> 1:02:51.841
I apologize that we have seemed

1:02:51.994 --> 1:02:53.326
To have overlooked that,

1:02:53.419 --> 1:02:54.752
But we'll correct that now.

1:02:54.772 --> 1:02:55.845
Portia, will you block out some

1:02:55.939 --> 1:02:56.663
Time this week for me

1:02:56.756 --> 1:02:58.164
To meet with elena, here.

1:02:58.258 --> 1:03:00.925
- You can do Thursday.
- Thursday it is.

1:03:00.944 --> 1:03:02.694
See you then.

1:03:03.596 --> 1:03:04.362
- See you.

1:03:06.116 --> 1:03:08.432
- Hey, what's up?
I texted you earlier.

1:03:08.527 --> 1:03:10.693
- Sorry, I've been really busy.

1:03:10.846 --> 1:03:13.371
(suspenseful music)

1:03:16.794 --> 1:03:17.709
- Are you okay?

1:03:18.945 --> 1:03:22.297
- Yeah, I just wasn't
expecting that.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:25.358
- I should've warned you about
the meet-and-great.

1:03:25.377 --> 1:03:27.969
Many have tried but I'm afraid
there's no getting out of it.

1:03:29.455 --> 1:03:30.713
Is that why you were in there?

1:03:30.866 --> 1:03:33.216
- Me? Uh... No, I'm...

1:03:33.368 --> 1:03:34.976
I'm helping lorenzo
with his side project.

1:03:35.203 --> 1:03:36.978
I could really use
the extra cash.

1:03:37.648 --> 1:03:38.538
- What is it?

1:03:38.631 --> 1:03:39.981
- I can't really talk about it,

1:03:40.133 --> 1:03:42.317
He made me sign an nda

1:03:43.712 --> 1:03:44.319
Oh.

1:03:45.547 --> 1:03:46.729
Hey!

1:03:47.324 --> 1:03:49.473
That's a really pretty scarf.

1:03:50.218 --> 1:03:51.809
It reminds me of one my mom
used to have.

1:03:52.312 --> 1:03:53.328
- It's nice, isn't it?

1:03:54.981 --> 1:03:56.665
I actually just picked it up.

1:03:57.242 --> 1:03:58.583
You can borrow it sometime
if you'd like.

1:03:59.728 --> 1:04:00.484
- Thanks.

1:04:00.504 --> 1:04:01.652
- Going down?

1:04:01.672 --> 1:04:04.339
- No, I better finish up here.

1:04:07.177 --> 1:04:07.843
- See you later.

1:04:10.589 --> 1:04:12.180
(suspenseful music)

1:04:16.761 --> 1:04:17.519
(sighs)

1:04:24.862 --> 1:04:26.528
- You have your meeting
with lorenzo today, right?

1:04:27.531 --> 1:04:28.755
- Unfortunately.

1:04:29.091 --> 1:04:29.847
- No, this is good.

1:04:29.867 --> 1:04:31.515
What you found in his schedule

1:04:31.610 --> 1:04:32.258
Proves that he was trying

1:04:32.277 --> 1:04:32.868
To cover up the fact

1:04:33.019 --> 1:04:34.185
That he was in town

1:04:34.279 --> 1:04:35.186
When your mom was killed.

1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:36.429
- Yeah, but how am I just

1:04:36.448 --> 1:04:37.372
Supposed to ask him about that?

1:04:38.876 --> 1:04:40.358
- You can't, not outright,
but having a one-on-one

1:04:40.377 --> 1:04:41.877
Conversation is a good start.

1:04:43.105 --> 1:04:44.212
See if you can get him
to talk about allie.

1:04:44.439 --> 1:04:45.029
- Allie?

1:04:45.123 --> 1:04:46.197
- Yeah, you said they had

1:04:46.216 --> 1:04:47.531
A private meeting.

1:04:47.626 --> 1:04:48.717
- Yeah, one she claimed to have

1:04:48.868 --> 1:04:50.201
Signed an nda for.

1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:51.720
- See if he'll say anything else
about it.

1:04:51.947 --> 1:04:53.296
- Find out what their
relationship is.

1:04:53.448 --> 1:04:54.055
- Okay.

1:04:56.059 --> 1:04:57.726
(mysterious music)

1:05:01.289 --> 1:05:02.731
(sighs)

1:05:16.079 --> 1:05:17.245
- Come in!

1:05:20.492 --> 1:05:21.917
Come on in.
Close the door, please.

1:05:24.070 --> 1:05:25.086
Have a seat, elena.

1:05:28.333 --> 1:05:29.591
Do you want something to drink?

1:05:30.986 --> 1:05:31.593
- I'm fine.

1:05:33.246 --> 1:05:36.914
Thank you. For doing this,
I mean.

1:05:37.659 --> 1:05:38.433
- It's important to me that my

1:05:38.660 --> 1:05:40.435
Employees feel
like they know me.

1:05:40.586 --> 1:05:43.163
That they can come to me
at any time for any reason.

1:05:43.181 --> 1:05:44.940
- People seem to enjoy
working for you.

1:05:45.091 --> 1:05:47.684
Like allie, for example.

1:05:47.836 --> 1:05:51.020
I mean, I'm guessing she's been
working for you for a while

1:05:51.173 --> 1:05:53.782
If you trust her enough
with an important side project.

1:05:53.933 --> 1:05:55.075
- Loyalty.

1:05:56.011 --> 1:05:57.118
You can't buy that.

1:05:57.270 --> 1:05:59.345
Well, actually, you can.

1:05:59.364 --> 1:06:00.346
(chuckling)

1:06:00.365 --> 1:06:02.273
So, never mind.

1:06:02.292 --> 1:06:04.701
What about you,
where'd you grow up?

1:06:05.796 --> 1:06:09.539
- Uh... I grew up in the
midwest, but most of my family

1:06:09.633 --> 1:06:11.541
Lives on the east coast,
that's why I moved out here.

1:06:11.635 --> 1:06:12.467
- Your parents?

1:06:14.805 --> 1:06:18.807
- My mother passed away
and I never knew my father.

1:06:20.885 --> 1:06:21.810
- You're like me.

1:06:23.129 --> 1:06:24.962
My mother died when I was young,

1:06:24.982 --> 1:06:26.398
My father was never
in the picture.

1:06:27.633 --> 1:06:29.133
It's hard in life
without having someone

1:06:29.227 --> 1:06:30.568
To guide you to the right path.

1:06:32.047 --> 1:06:33.655
- You seem to have done pretty
well for yourself.

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:37.217
- Yeah, I'm doing well now.

1:06:37.235 --> 1:06:39.219
But it's been a long road
to get here, a lot of bumps,

1:06:39.237 --> 1:06:40.453
Lot of dead ends.

1:06:41.406 --> 1:06:42.497
- How'd you turn it around?

1:06:44.242 --> 1:06:48.152
- First, I had to figure out
who I was, but once I did that,

1:06:48.171 --> 1:06:49.912
I realized that
I was good at something:

1:06:50.065 --> 1:06:51.006
Business.

1:06:52.492 --> 1:06:54.175
If I could put that to work
for me in the right way,

1:06:54.327 --> 1:06:55.993
I knew that I could
be successful.

1:06:56.513 --> 1:06:58.346
- You seem to have
it all figured out.

1:06:58.573 --> 1:06:59.572
(chuckling)

1:06:59.591 --> 1:07:00.849
- Not quite.

1:07:02.019 --> 1:07:03.518
What about you, elena?

1:07:03.745 --> 1:07:04.835
I'm getting the sense
that you don't like

1:07:04.929 --> 1:07:06.262
Talking about yourself.

1:07:06.839 --> 1:07:08.356
- I'm not that interesting.

1:07:10.861 --> 1:07:12.027
- What is it you want?

1:07:14.013 --> 1:07:15.155
What are you doing here?

1:07:16.033 --> 1:07:17.681
Why work at l.B. Corp?

1:07:18.869 --> 1:07:21.494
- It's a great company
with lots of opportunities.

1:07:22.039 --> 1:07:23.371
- I know that,

1:07:25.191 --> 1:07:26.374
But what do you want?

1:07:28.620 --> 1:07:29.952
- What do I want from you?

1:07:30.105 --> 1:07:31.713
- Be honest.

1:07:38.613 --> 1:07:40.680
- You really want
to know about me?

1:07:42.634 --> 1:07:45.376
- My name is elena russo.

1:07:45.395 --> 1:07:48.379
My mother was teresa russo,
she was murdered the day that

1:07:48.398 --> 1:07:49.564
She came to visit my grandmother

1:07:49.715 --> 1:07:51.549
After hiding from
you for 21 years.

1:07:52.235 --> 1:07:55.070
You are my father
and I think you killed her.

1:07:56.631 --> 1:07:57.697
- Elena!

1:07:58.891 --> 1:08:00.483
- You can't run in here!

1:08:00.577 --> 1:08:02.577
- Elena, stop!

1:08:02.728 --> 1:08:04.913
(suspenseful music)

1:08:07.642 --> 1:08:09.042
Elena!

1:08:10.921 --> 1:08:12.587
Elena!

1:08:13.256 --> 1:08:17.092
(eerie music)

1:08:42.768 --> 1:08:46.788
(suspenseful music)

1:09:19.214 --> 1:09:21.397
- Come on... Answer!

1:09:21.549 --> 1:09:23.491
(whimpering)

1:09:24.661 --> 1:09:25.660
(tires screeching)

1:09:45.907 --> 1:09:46.514
Allie!

1:09:53.097 --> 1:09:54.856
- Freeze, drop your weapon!

1:09:55.859 --> 1:09:56.858
(grunting)

1:09:58.586 --> 1:10:01.029
(whimpering)

1:10:05.368 --> 1:10:06.367
Are you alright?

1:10:07.762 --> 1:10:08.536
- I'm okay.

1:10:09.431 --> 1:10:10.705
What just happened?

1:10:11.541 --> 1:10:12.373
- We got her.

1:10:13.210 --> 1:10:14.042
Can you stand?

1:10:16.028 --> 1:10:16.711
- Come on.

1:10:17.439 --> 1:10:18.046
Come on.

1:10:21.943 --> 1:10:23.551
Damn it!

1:10:31.895 --> 1:10:32.894
- Is that blood?

1:10:33.045 --> 1:10:33.711
- Uh, huh.

1:10:33.805 --> 1:10:35.563
- Oh god, where is she?

1:10:37.067 --> 1:10:38.024
- She's gone.

1:10:42.221 --> 1:10:44.072
- That's her phone.

1:10:48.820 --> 1:10:50.203
- It's evidence now.

1:11:01.258 --> 1:11:04.259
Come on, let's get you
some place safe.

1:11:06.821 --> 1:11:08.054
Stay close.

1:11:23.354 --> 1:11:25.171
- I can't believe
you were right about her.

1:11:25.765 --> 1:11:27.115
- You're in shock,
you should rest.

1:11:28.768 --> 1:11:31.193
- Do you think
she's acting for lorenzo?

1:11:31.288 --> 1:11:33.121
- We can't say until there's
a thorough investigation.

1:11:34.106 --> 1:11:35.348
We need to get her in custody.

1:11:35.441 --> 1:11:36.849
Until that's done, I'm afraid

1:11:36.868 --> 1:11:37.959
You'll have to keep laying low.

1:11:40.297 --> 1:11:41.296
- I...

1:11:42.874 --> 1:11:45.633
That might be tough after what
happened today at work.

1:11:46.303 --> 1:11:47.260
- What happened?

1:11:49.364 --> 1:11:51.380
- You know how I was meeting
with lorenzo?

1:11:52.475 --> 1:11:55.143
Well, he kept asking me
questions, prying and eventually

1:11:55.370 --> 1:11:58.438
I just snapped
and I told him everything.

1:11:59.465 --> 1:12:00.648
- What's everything?

1:12:03.320 --> 1:12:06.821
- I told him who I am and
that I think he killed my mom.

1:12:07.565 --> 1:12:08.564
- Holy...

1:12:08.716 --> 1:12:10.140
- I know.

1:12:10.234 --> 1:12:12.552
I know I shouldn't have let my
emotions get the better of me

1:12:12.645 --> 1:12:14.070
But you should have seen him.

1:12:14.906 --> 1:12:17.981
He paints himself out
to be some nice guy then he acts

1:12:18.076 --> 1:12:21.169
Like he wants to help everyone
but I know he's a killer and...

1:12:24.082 --> 1:12:25.673
She's probably working for him.

1:12:27.827 --> 1:12:30.178
And I was their special project.

1:12:30.405 --> 1:12:31.829
- We don't have proof
of that yet.

1:12:31.923 --> 1:12:33.181
- You have allie's phone,

1:12:34.166 --> 1:12:35.925
There's probably
something on there.

1:12:36.077 --> 1:12:37.243
- Yes, you're right.

1:12:38.521 --> 1:12:40.170
I'll have to get to the lab
for processing but it'll take

1:12:40.264 --> 1:12:41.356
Time, which we don't have.

1:12:43.101 --> 1:12:44.859
- I'm so sorry.

1:12:45.862 --> 1:12:48.254
I screwed everything up today.

1:12:48.272 --> 1:12:53.368
- No, you did the opposite, you
brought us a break in the case.

1:12:53.519 --> 1:12:55.203
We have a lot for
our team to go on.

1:13:00.860 --> 1:13:03.044
- What if we turn
the tables on lorenzo?

1:13:03.713 --> 1:13:04.954
- What do you mean?

1:13:05.106 --> 1:13:06.339
- Well...

1:13:07.942 --> 1:13:09.884
What if we asked
him for another meeting?

1:13:10.536 --> 1:13:11.844
One we could record.

1:13:13.556 --> 1:13:14.555
- It could work.

1:13:16.134 --> 1:13:18.375
We could play the allie's phone
card, make it sound like

1:13:18.469 --> 1:13:21.137
We found something on it,
something incriminating to him.

1:13:21.231 --> 1:13:22.805
- We'll do it at jackie's place,
I'll set it up.

1:13:22.899 --> 1:13:23.806
- Wait.

1:13:23.958 --> 1:13:25.808
If we do this, we have to think

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:28.051
It through, every detail.

1:13:28.146 --> 1:13:30.405
The last thing I want to do
is put you in even more danger,

1:13:30.632 --> 1:13:32.573
Especially with allie
still on the loose.

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:35.701
- We have to do this,
it's our only shot.

1:13:37.138 --> 1:13:39.205
Look, you saved my life today.

1:13:40.491 --> 1:13:42.583
I won't be reckless.

1:13:44.979 --> 1:13:46.087
- Good.

1:13:49.150 --> 1:13:50.425
- So is that a yes?

1:14:00.662 --> 1:14:01.602
(sighing)

1:14:01.829 --> 1:14:02.770
- Ready?

1:14:03.756 --> 1:14:05.347
- I'm nervous.

1:14:05.500 --> 1:14:07.183
- Oh...

1:14:07.277 --> 1:14:09.852
Hey, is that thing live?

1:14:10.004 --> 1:14:10.695
- Yeah.

1:14:11.839 --> 1:14:15.357
- Wow, big brother
in my own house.

1:14:16.101 --> 1:14:19.620
- I really appreciate
you doing this, jackie.

1:14:20.957 --> 1:14:22.698
- For you and teresa?

1:14:22.850 --> 1:14:23.624
Anything.

1:14:28.298 --> 1:14:30.372
- Is that clock right?
Because he was supposed

1:14:30.467 --> 1:14:33.526
To be here at seven o'clock.
What if he's not coming?

1:14:33.544 --> 1:14:35.878
- There are a million reasons
why he could be late.

1:14:35.972 --> 1:14:38.473
Here, drink this.

1:14:41.035 --> 1:14:41.642
Go on,

1:14:41.794 --> 1:14:42.810
<i> Bottoms up.</i>

1:14:43.721 --> 1:14:44.553
- Easy on the wine.

1:14:44.706 --> 1:14:45.646
<i>(elena): Do you think he's late</i>

1:14:45.798 --> 1:14:46.463
Because of traffic?

1:14:46.557 --> 1:14:47.297
<i> (jackie): Definitely,</i>

1:14:47.317 --> 1:14:48.465
<i> It's always traffic.</i>

1:14:48.485 --> 1:14:49.633
(phone ringing)

1:14:49.727 --> 1:14:50.559
<i> There's construction,</i>

1:14:50.712 --> 1:14:51.560
<i> Have you been on the turnpike?</i>

1:14:51.713 --> 1:14:52.378
- Carter.

1:14:52.396 --> 1:14:53.303
<i> (elena): I don't know,</i>

1:14:53.323 --> 1:14:54.304
<i> Have you taken me there yet?</i>

1:14:54.324 --> 1:14:55.490
- Yes.
<i> (jackie): I have.</i>

1:14:55.717 --> 1:14:57.399
<i> (elena): Is traffic bad</i>
<i> in new jersey?</i>

1:14:57.494 --> 1:14:58.326
- What's that?

1:14:59.662 --> 1:15:00.720
<i> (jackie): ...Construction,</i>
<i> people, cars.</i>

1:15:00.813 --> 1:15:03.405
<i> Everyone's got two cars now,</i>
<i> why?</i>

1:15:03.558 --> 1:15:05.315
(suspenseful music)

1:15:05.409 --> 1:15:06.892
<i> ...Traffic after seven.</i>

1:15:06.986 --> 1:15:08.002
- Have you id'd the victim?

1:15:12.750 --> 1:15:13.841
Is he dead?

1:15:16.404 --> 1:15:17.470
I'll meet you there.

1:15:25.263 --> 1:15:26.521
(engine starting)

1:15:29.250 --> 1:15:30.266
(sighing)

1:15:30.418 --> 1:15:31.508
- What's up?

1:15:31.528 --> 1:15:32.527
- He's not coming.

1:15:34.088 --> 1:15:35.863
I was stupid to think
that this could work.

1:15:37.091 --> 1:15:38.366
- You're not stupid.

1:15:38.517 --> 1:15:43.663
You can't control chaos
and lorenzo's nothing but chaos.

1:15:46.617 --> 1:15:47.708
- Um, no.

1:15:48.694 --> 1:15:50.711
I wouldn't describe him as that.

1:15:50.863 --> 1:15:52.547
He's more calculated.

1:15:52.774 --> 1:15:53.714
- Trust me.

1:15:57.703 --> 1:16:00.555
- How do you know
so much about lorenzo anyway?

1:16:01.558 --> 1:16:04.058
- I used to know him quite well,

1:16:04.209 --> 1:16:05.634
Better than anyone.

1:16:05.787 --> 1:16:10.380
And he knew me too,

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:14.068
Like, really knew me.

1:16:14.219 --> 1:16:16.737
What we had was special.

1:16:18.241 --> 1:16:21.909
Until teresa
had to come and ruin it!

1:16:22.579 --> 1:16:25.471
- What... What are you doing?

1:16:25.489 --> 1:16:26.989
- You wanted answers, right?

1:16:27.141 --> 1:16:28.641
I mean, that's why we're here.

1:16:28.659 --> 1:16:31.327
Ooh, are you feeling
a little foggy?

1:16:31.479 --> 1:16:32.253
- Mm-hmm.

1:16:33.906 --> 1:16:36.406
- 'cause I gave you my special
vintage, I put a little

1:16:36.426 --> 1:16:38.000
Something extra in it for you.

1:16:38.152 --> 1:16:38.926
(gasping)

1:16:41.823 --> 1:16:47.176
Lorenzo had an annoying soft
spot for teresa,

1:16:47.270 --> 1:16:50.329
But not even she could compete
with what we had.

1:16:51.499 --> 1:16:54.333
I guess that's why she had
to go get herself knocked up.

1:16:54.352 --> 1:16:55.017
(groaning)

1:16:55.111 --> 1:16:56.760
Listen to me!

1:16:56.779 --> 1:16:59.280
This is important!

1:16:59.507 --> 1:17:04.026
I was loyal to him,
even after what she did!

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:08.289
I gave him everything,
even a daughter of our own!

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.458
- A daughter?

1:17:12.203 --> 1:17:15.187
- I wanted him to know how much
I loved him but he was always

1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:18.190
Fixated on what
he couldn't have:

1:17:18.209 --> 1:17:20.693
Teresa and you.

1:17:21.195 --> 1:17:23.379
He became obsessed.

1:17:23.473 --> 1:17:26.048
He started visiting sofia
with the hope that the bitch

1:17:26.200 --> 1:17:27.642
Would come and visit one day.

1:17:29.128 --> 1:17:31.312
To be fair, she finally did.

1:17:33.632 --> 1:17:34.315
(groaning)

1:17:34.542 --> 1:17:35.650
Wake up!

1:17:37.211 --> 1:17:39.487
- You and my mom weren't
friends?

1:17:39.972 --> 1:17:44.325
- Oh, we were at a certain
point, but after the accident,

1:17:44.476 --> 1:17:46.735
I mean, things could
never be the same.

1:17:46.829 --> 1:17:47.995
We both moved on.

1:17:50.816 --> 1:17:52.833
We just moved on
with the same guy.

1:17:54.578 --> 1:17:56.170
- Where's your daughter now?

1:17:56.673 --> 1:17:58.631
- Oh, you met her.

1:17:59.491 --> 1:18:01.676
My beautiful, allie.

1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:05.404
(whimpering)

1:18:05.423 --> 1:18:07.348
Oh, no, no, no.

1:18:08.592 --> 1:18:10.910
I can't let you call carter.

1:18:10.928 --> 1:18:12.594
I'll take care of him next.

1:18:12.747 --> 1:18:14.522
(laboured breathing)

1:18:14.749 --> 1:18:18.150
The same way I dealt
with lorenzo and teresa.

1:18:23.758 --> 1:18:25.449
- You killed my mom?

1:18:26.594 --> 1:18:28.928
- She got what
was coming to her.

1:18:28.946 --> 1:18:32.331
Like mother, like daughter.

1:18:42.443 --> 1:18:43.634
- Seems like
a lover's spat to me.

1:18:44.295 --> 1:18:44.960
- How do you figure?

1:18:45.112 --> 1:18:46.278
- Final text on his phone

1:18:46.297 --> 1:18:47.388
Says it all.

1:18:54.622 --> 1:18:56.046
- Did you run a trace
on the number?

1:18:56.065 --> 1:18:57.881
- Unregistered,
it's a burner phone,

1:18:57.975 --> 1:18:58.974
But there is something else.

1:18:59.068 --> 1:18:59.900
Excuse me.

1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:04.405
Vape pen, we found
this under the passenger seat,

1:19:04.632 --> 1:19:05.481
Must have fallen
between the cracks.

1:19:05.575 --> 1:19:06.465
We swabbed it for dna,

1:19:06.558 --> 1:19:07.575
The lab's working on it now.

1:19:10.729 --> 1:19:12.229
- Call me with the result,

1:19:12.248 --> 1:19:13.247
Keep me posted on
the victim's status.

1:19:13.398 --> 1:19:14.165
- Will do.

1:19:28.339 --> 1:19:30.765
(mysterious music)

1:19:32.843 --> 1:19:33.934
(tires screeching)

1:19:35.513 --> 1:19:36.604
- Why do all this?

1:19:37.848 --> 1:19:40.349
- Teresa put lorenzo
away for years.

1:19:40.443 --> 1:19:43.360
That was years away
from my daughter's life!

1:19:45.856 --> 1:19:48.598
Why did he think
that barista job

1:19:48.618 --> 1:19:49.283
Would make up for everything--

1:19:49.510 --> 1:19:50.868
(screaming)

1:19:52.437 --> 1:19:55.790
- You and your mother
ruined our lives!

1:19:55.941 --> 1:19:58.125
(screaming)

1:20:00.538 --> 1:20:02.463
(phone ringing)

1:20:03.282 --> 1:20:04.039
What was that?

1:20:04.191 --> 1:20:05.691
Oh!

1:20:05.784 --> 1:20:07.526
It's your little
rent-a-cop friend,

1:20:07.619 --> 1:20:09.361
Looks like he's on his way back.

1:20:09.454 --> 1:20:10.805
Do you want me to respond?

1:20:11.032 --> 1:20:12.973
(screaming)

1:20:25.637 --> 1:20:26.737
(clanking)

1:20:27.715 --> 1:20:28.656
(screaming)

1:20:36.833 --> 1:20:38.481
(panting)

1:20:38.576 --> 1:20:39.750
(mysterious music)

1:20:48.827 --> 1:20:50.845
(suspenseful music)

1:20:56.410 --> 1:20:59.186
(whimpering)

1:21:00.022 --> 1:21:01.689
(engine starting)

1:21:02.674 --> 1:21:04.099
(screaming)

1:21:04.193 --> 1:21:05.776
(tires screeching)

1:21:41.639 --> 1:21:43.647
- Elena, are you alright?

1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:45.399
- Uh-huh.

1:21:47.403 --> 1:21:48.551
Is she...

1:21:48.571 --> 1:21:49.486
- She's dead.

1:21:52.408 --> 1:21:54.074
- No...

1:21:55.745 --> 1:21:57.077
Mom...

1:21:58.822 --> 1:22:00.748
(whimpering)

1:22:10.742 --> 1:22:14.678
- Allison armstrong, you have
the right to remain silent.

1:22:16.323 --> 1:22:19.341
Anything you say can
and will be used against

1:22:19.435 --> 1:22:20.434
You in a court of law.

1:22:31.596 --> 1:22:33.030
(grunting)

1:22:47.946 --> 1:22:48.796
You alright?

1:22:50.524 --> 1:22:51.632
- Yeah.

1:22:52.693 --> 1:22:54.134
Any news about my dad?

1:22:54.712 --> 1:22:55.970
- Looks like he's gonna
pull through.

1:22:59.291 --> 1:23:02.701
- Well, I have to head out,
new case assignment.

1:23:03.220 --> 1:23:04.536
- They'll be lucky to have you.

1:23:04.629 --> 1:23:06.814
- I wish you'd consider joining
the program but...

1:23:09.210 --> 1:23:10.559
You'll keep in touch?
Text me, let me know

1:23:10.653 --> 1:23:11.634
How you're doing.

1:23:11.729 --> 1:23:12.653
- I will, I promise.

1:23:15.324 --> 1:23:18.993
- Oh, and elena, if you ever
need anything--

1:23:19.720 --> 1:23:20.995
(soft music)

1:23:25.817 --> 1:23:26.834
- Thank you.

1:23:28.062 --> 1:23:28.752
- Thank you.

1:23:47.765 --> 1:23:49.356
- Do you mind if I join you?

1:23:54.196 --> 1:23:55.446
Alright, thanks.

1:23:59.943 --> 1:24:03.787
I want to say I'm sorry,
for everything that's happened,

1:24:04.540 --> 1:24:06.206
Especially with allie.

1:24:08.619 --> 1:24:14.048
I knew jackie had been feeding
her lies for years but I didn't

1:24:14.275 --> 1:24:15.549
Realize how bad things
had gotten.

1:24:16.535 --> 1:24:19.611
- Maybe, serving time will do

1:24:19.704 --> 1:24:20.971
Her some good
like it did for you.

1:24:22.725 --> 1:24:23.965
It changed your life.

1:24:24.451 --> 1:24:25.893
- I hope so.

1:24:27.045 --> 1:24:28.729
(soft music)

1:24:31.067 --> 1:24:32.066
- What is it?

1:24:33.736 --> 1:24:35.903
- You look so much like teresa.

1:24:45.139 --> 1:24:47.414
- I saw a video
of you harassing her at sofia's

1:24:47.566 --> 1:24:52.086
House and that was
the last day she was alive.

1:24:55.740 --> 1:24:57.257
- I went there
to feed sofia's cat.

1:24:57.409 --> 1:24:59.651
I've been taking care
of her ever since sofia

1:24:59.670 --> 1:25:01.178
Went into the hospital.

1:25:03.157 --> 1:25:05.432
I never expected
to see teresa there.

1:25:06.602 --> 1:25:09.436
I just wanted
to talk to her, but...

1:25:14.168 --> 1:25:16.777
I know it's my
fault because of who I was

1:25:16.928 --> 1:25:19.113
And how I treated
teresa back then.

1:25:20.341 --> 1:25:22.116
I didn't deserve
anything from her.

1:25:22.843 --> 1:25:24.952
I don't deserve
anything from you either.

1:25:26.271 --> 1:25:28.956
(laboured breathing)

1:25:34.538 --> 1:25:35.963
(gasps)

1:25:41.211 --> 1:25:42.636
- Is this a dream?

1:25:44.473 --> 1:25:45.305
- It's all real.

1:25:46.308 --> 1:25:48.142
I'm right here, grandma.

1:25:50.646 --> 1:25:54.314
- Pretty girl, tell me...
Tell me everything.

1:26:02.566 --> 1:26:05.909
- Well, my name is elena.

1:26:08.164 --> 1:26:11.165
Elena sofia, actually.

1:26:13.652 --> 1:26:16.819
I was born October 14, 2001.

1:26:17.231 --> 1:26:18.839
Mom and I lived in cincinnati,

1:26:19.066 --> 1:26:21.675
It was always
just the two of us.

1:26:23.404 --> 1:26:26.847
And she really was the best.

1:26:27.516 --> 1:26:30.350
(♪♪)

1:26:32.688 --> 1:26:33.687
Subtitling: Difuze
