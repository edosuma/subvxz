01:05.799 --> 01:09.769
All right then, son.
Why don't you tell me your name?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.438
You already know my name.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.307
I'd like you to tell me
what it is anyway.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.676
-Why?
-It's for their benefit.

01:16.677 --> 01:20.144
-Who's "they"?
-Whoever's listening.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.451
My name is Harvey Miller.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.220
What's your date of birth,
Harvey?

01:27.221 --> 01:29.556
April 19, 1989.

01:29.557 --> 01:33.193
You're 22. That's a good age.
Wish I were 22.

01:33.194 --> 01:37.263
- I wish I were a lot of things.
- What do you wish you were, Harvey?

01:37.264 --> 01:40.333
- Somewhere else.
- Fair play.

01:40.334 --> 01:42.769
Harvey, I want you
to do something for me.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.671
- What?
- I want you to tell me what you're doing,

01:44.672 --> 01:47.373
sat in front of me,
bleeding and under arrest.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.477
- Where shall I start?
- Well, I do hope you don't miss out on the bit...

01:50.478 --> 01:55.748
where a mutual acquaintance of ours finds himself
being wheeled into an intensive care unit.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.650
What makes you think
I know him?

01:57.651 --> 02:01.387
Statements of about
30 eyewitnesses.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.389
I knew I should have been
a little less conspicuous.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.191
Yeah.

02:05.192 --> 02:08.495
You can joke about it
if you like, Harvey,

02:08.496 --> 02:10.697
but this is
a serious situation.

02:10.698 --> 02:13.466
I can tell by the state of your face
that you didn't launch...

02:13.467 --> 02:16.336
a surprise attack
on Mr. Roper.

02:16.337 --> 02:18.271
At least, if you did,
it wasn't very successful.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.241
Given his track record,
you may have well acted in self-defense.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.809
But he's the one
in hospital.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.678
If he doesn't wake up,
you're going to be in a lot of trouble.

02:25.679 --> 02:28.515
And if he does wake up
 and he's more convincing than you,

02:28.516 --> 02:31.451
you're still gonna be
in a lot of trouble.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.487
You've only been out
a matter of weeks, Harvey.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.624
You're not going to be the golden boy
in any court in England.

02:37.625 --> 02:41.294
There'll be no probation with 12 months
off for good behavior this time round.

02:41.295 --> 02:45.331
So, if I consider you to be soliciting lies,
or acting in an uncooperative manner,

02:45.332 --> 02:47.534
it will be construed as
a violation of your probation.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.335
I'll return you
to prison tonight.

02:50.937 --> 02:54.507
Do you understand
what I'm telling you, Harvey.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.777
- Yeah.
- Well, be sure not to leave anything out then, won't you?

02:57.778 --> 03:00.680
If you really want full picture,
we're going to be here a while.

03:00.681 --> 03:05.083
You have my undivided attention
for the rest of the night.

03:25.905 --> 03:29.275
Demps, it's Harvey.
I'm out.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.444
Got my papers last night.
Didn't get a chance to phone.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.214
Listen, mate,
I-I need a lift.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.216
Ain't got enough money
for the train.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.451
I'll go to the station,
wait outside till 3:00.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.520
If-- If you haven't, um--

03:40.521 --> 03:43.554
Oh, for fuck's sake.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.250
Shite haircut, dated clothes
and a nervous stare.

04:10.251 --> 04:12.685
You've either been let out of
prison or kicked out of the army.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.020
You're all right, Demps.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.790
Not bad, Harvey.
Not bad.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.661
Look at you.
You've not changed a bit.

04:21.661 --> 04:23.296
Can't believe
it's been six months.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.365
It's been a year.
Oh, right.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.966
Yeah. Can't have missed
you very much then.

04:26.967 --> 04:29.335
Cheeky bastard.
I know.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.638
Twelve months, three days
this morning.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.741
Didn't think I'd recognize you, seeing as you
gave us all the fuck-off when you went in.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.976
Nothing for a year. Then a
phone call asking for a lift.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.013
You know how it is, Demps. I didn't
want you to see me-- I know how it is.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.747
Come on.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.052
You look good, mate.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.620
Thanks.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.555
How was it?

04:49.556 --> 04:51.791
Lot of reading.
Lot of wasted time.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.494
Came through it though.
You're a harder man than me.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.329
Like that were ever
in question.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.398
Do you want to walk home?

04:58.399 --> 04:59.899
Probably be safer.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.701
What happened
to your van?

05:01.702 --> 05:04.404
Impounded by Christians for exceeding
tobacco limit.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.639
Temp replacement.
Naught to 60?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.540
If you push it down
a big hill. Get in.

05:14.647 --> 05:19.352
Good-looking lad like you, 12 months inside?
Must hurt to sit down.

05:19.353 --> 05:20.887
Twat.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.424
You weren't though--
You know--

05:24.425 --> 05:26.959
Just drive, you dickhead.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.961
Fucking bloody Christ.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.030
Charlie didn't
know it were Dodd's bird.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.700
Dodd had been keeping her well away
from us since he started seeing her...

05:33.701 --> 05:35.702
for fear she'd realize
he was the least interesting...

05:35.703 --> 05:37.870
and ugliest out of his
group of mates, which he is.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.406
But he should have known that none of
his mates would have shagged her...

05:40.407 --> 05:42.041
had they known
it were his bird.

05:42.042 --> 05:45.011
I'm not taking sides here. But if
you're Charlie, you're in a nightclub,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.914
there's a decent bird hanging round your
neck, practically begging you for a length,

05:47.915 --> 05:51.351
you don't stop to say, "Sorry, sweetheart,
I would shag you six ways from Sunday",

05:51.352 --> 05:53.553
but a mate of mine's got this
bird who I haven't even met yet,

05:53.554 --> 05:55.355
"and for all I know
it could be you."

05:55.356 --> 05:57.357
Fucking daft. You try
explaining that to Dodd...

05:57.358 --> 05:59.359
when he walks in on Charlie
banging her from behind...

05:59.360 --> 06:01.060
and slapping her ass
on Sunday morning.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.830
Poor bastard was so destroyed,
he passed out there and then.

06:03.831 --> 06:06.599
He only popped round to see if Charlie
fancied having his dinner round theirs,

06:06.600 --> 06:09.333
and found the door unlocked--
terrible business.

06:10.436 --> 06:12.739
Say, Harvey?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.674
Harvey!

06:14.675 --> 06:16.909
I took the scenic route 'cause I
know you like the countryside.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.945
Didn't expect to be talking
to myself, ignorant bastard.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.813
Sorry, mate.
What were you saying?

06:20.814 --> 06:23.015
I were telling you about Dodd
catching Charlie doing his bird,

06:23.016 --> 06:24.917
and how they've been
at each other's throats since.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.620
Oh, yeah. Got
a letter from Charlie.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.754
Gotta laugh, haven't you?

06:31.424 --> 06:33.593
Talking about letters, you heard
anything from your mum yet?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.927
No.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.097
Fair enough.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.464
Stay with me then, eh?

06:57.049 --> 06:58.785
Hey up, lads.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.820
Nice one, Dodd.
Keep 'em coming.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.622
3.20 a pint.
Fuck off.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.658
Oh, must've broke your heart
handing that 20 across the bar.

07:05.659 --> 07:09.195
Can I have me change,
by the way?

07:09.196 --> 07:12.598
Must make a nice change from the antifreeze
you've been sucking out of condoms the last year.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.867
You can't really appreciate a drink
you don't risk your ass out for.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.736
Mmm.
Where's mine?

07:16.737 --> 07:19.739
At the bar, you fucking prick.
Fuck you, Dodd.

07:19.740 --> 07:23.009
How many times? I didn't know
it was your fucking bird!

07:23.010 --> 07:25.077
Yeah, well, you didn't ask.
Fucking dick.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.747
- It wasn't worth the fuck anyway.
- Say it any louder, Charlie,

07:27.748 --> 07:30.149
and I'll swallow you, you scrawny little twat!
Will you two pack it in?

07:30.150 --> 07:32.752
- We're meant to be celebrating.
- Sorry, Harvey.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.720
Cheers.
Cheers.

07:34.721 --> 07:39.025
So I hear it's true, Harvey.
Prison does do things to a man.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.061
You what? I were worried.
I had to tell them.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.797
- Tell them what?
- That despite the fact that it's been a year...

07:44.798 --> 07:47.934
since you've even <i>seen</i> a bird, you haven't
once mentioned the need to get your knob felt.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.969
Sex, Harvey, by a woman.

07:49.970 --> 07:55.842
Going past the massage parlor on Sheffield
Road, trying to drop the hint. Nothing.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.711
Have you ever been in that place?
Those Thai girls aren't girls.

07:58.712 --> 08:01.647
Are you fucking serious?

08:01.648 --> 08:03.249
Your fucking face.

08:03.250 --> 08:06.686
He loves a fucking Thai
lady boy though, that one.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.589
Yeah, don't worry.
I'll make a move soon.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.792
So it's not because you're saving
yourself for anyone in particular.

08:12.793 --> 08:17.697
We were just wondering whether you
were gonna try for reconciliation.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.699
No, too much time's passed.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.767
Don't even know her anymore.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.536
What she knows of me,
she don't like.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.538
See, the reason I ask is that,

08:25.539 --> 08:28.207
she's out at the edge
of the dance floor, alone.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.543
To the best of my knowledge,
she's not a regular here.

08:30.544 --> 08:35.011
- Where?
- She's right there.

08:44.957 --> 08:46.726
- Fucking hell.
- Looking good, isn't she, mate?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.995
- She always looked good.
- Too good for you.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.997
- What're you waiting for?
- I'm not gonna go talk to her.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.965
- Why not?
- What would I say?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.600
I'd rather a hello?

08:54.601 --> 08:56.802
- Realistically.
- Well, a million things.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.071
- It's not like there's no history there, is it?
- No, there's too much.

08:59.072 --> 09:03.109
History, Harvey,
is just oils on a canvas.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.145
You own the paint, so you get
to change your own picture.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.813
Where the fuck
did you get that?

09:07.814 --> 09:09.882
Dear Deidre.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.653
Don't mean it's not true The worst
thing about history, Harvey,

09:13.654 --> 09:16.789
is that people only tend to look at it
through the tearful eyes of regret.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.625
Oh, God, stop now,
you sleazy bastard.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.261
Oh, you are so full of shit.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.829
Go talk to her.

09:26.999 --> 09:30.069
- Give her one from me, pal.
- "Give her one from me"-- How profound.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.038
- Fuck off, Charlie.
- Budge up.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.608
Look at the sleaze go past.
Oh, it's all over me trousers.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.910
It's good to
have you back, mate. Here.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.712
That's the key to our flat.

09:39.713 --> 09:43.316
I suggest that if you do have a
little sleepover with the lady,

09:43.317 --> 09:47.385
you do it at her place, because
you're in the sitting room.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.831
Shut the fuck up.
Your problem is your bird.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.300
You need to get it right.
She came on to me, knowing--

10:01.301 --> 10:03.235
Because you're not
talking to me--

10:03.236 --> 10:05.738
I told you, you speak again,
I'm gonna knock you out.

10:05.739 --> 10:09.974
You're not talking to me 'cause a bird
is getting in between our relationship.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.882
Must be further
than it looks.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.685
Seemed to take you forever
to make it over here.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.993
Yeah, I think I look good too.
Thanks for mentioning it.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.328
Can I buy you a drink?
I'm sure you can.

10:29.329 --> 10:32.064
Will I drink it if you do is the
question you should be asking.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.799
Would you?
No.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.168
But maybe that's 'cause
I just bought this one.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.903
If you bought me another,
it'd go flat,

10:37.904 --> 10:40.373
and the ice would melt before
I had a chance to take a sip.

10:40.374 --> 10:43.674
Or maybe, it's because
I hate the very sight of you.

10:44.076 --> 10:47.046
- Do you?
- Maybe.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.282
Can I sit down, wait till your glass is empty?
See how the theory pans out?

10:50.283 --> 10:51.884
That depends.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.986
On?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.655
What you want.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.023
Shall I sit down?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.825
Don't you want
to have sex with me?

10:59.826 --> 11:02.194
Well, it's been
over a year, Harvey,

11:02.195 --> 11:05.162
and like you wanted to say,
I do look good.

11:06.899 --> 11:11.137
Or do you just want
to talk about your feelings?

11:11.138 --> 11:15.174
I'm sure it's a while since you've
been able to open up emotionally.

11:15.175 --> 11:20.110
Or are you going to apologize for being
the absolute prick that broke my heart?

11:20.780 --> 11:23.681
How about all three?

11:52.878 --> 11:54.447
Come back to bed.

11:54.448 --> 11:57.016
I won't be able
to walk around the ward.

11:57.017 --> 12:00.453
- No, to sleep.
- My shift starts in half an hour.

12:00.454 --> 12:04.090
- Made you a cup of tea though.
- It's the middle of the night, for Christ's sake.

12:04.091 --> 12:09.261
- Can't you call in sick?
- It's 7:30, and, no, I can't.

12:09.262 --> 12:12.530
It'll take half the day
to walk back to the estate.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.768
Trust you to inconvenience
matters by moving.

12:15.769 --> 12:19.236
Too many people I don't
want to see on that estate.

12:20.139 --> 12:22.306
I know the feeling.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.793
I left you my number
with that cup of tea.

12:44.363 --> 12:46.697
I really got to go.

13:57.036 --> 14:00.104
Hello.
Hi.

14:04.844 --> 14:08.879
Dempsey?
She's gone, mate.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.779
What time
do you call this?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.450
- You've got my stuff.
- I know.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.619
My mum chucked it all in
the skip before she left.

14:46.620 --> 14:50.522
We saw her do it, so me and Charlie
got it all back and fetched it here.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.358
You never told me.

14:52.359 --> 14:56.295
I wanted it to be a surprise, see
the smile on your little face.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.597
If I'd known you'd be bangin' around
the flat in the middle of the night,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.432
I would've thought twice.
Thanks, mate.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.669
Say it with tea.
Lots of tea.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.238
With lots and lots
of sugar in it.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.074
Hang your stuff
up there, mate.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.010
Where you off to?

15:11.011 --> 15:13.844
For a shit.
What time is it?

15:13.946 --> 15:15.414
Half-9:00.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.816
Kitchen's there.
See you at 10:00.

15:20.486 --> 15:23.187
Why are you not talking still?
Don't you fucking start.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.525
Fuck off.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.961
Shut up, you dickhead,
and read the pa--

15:28.962 --> 15:31.063
- Hey up, Harvey.
- You two lovebirds still bickering?

15:31.064 --> 15:34.566
- All right.
- Come sit next to me, pal.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.170
Pretty face like yours, 12 months
inside-- Oh, it must hurt to sit.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.292
Already got this one
from Dempsey.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.277
You thieving little bastard.
You know that's my joke.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.579
- You should've picked him up in <i>your</i> car.
- I don't have a car.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.214
- And that's my fault, is it?
- Fuck off!

15:49.215 --> 15:51.684
So, the engagement's
back on then?

15:51.685 --> 15:54.219
The way she ran out this morning, I
wouldn't bet your pension on it.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.423
- Cold shoulder?
- No, I--

15:57.424 --> 15:59.558
I don't know.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.227
Don't matter. I won't be around long
enough to make a go of it anyway.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.363
Where are you going?

16:04.364 --> 16:08.265
Well, that's what I wanted
to talk to you all about.

16:09.401 --> 16:11.303
Out with it.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.540
Right. Basically...

16:14.541 --> 16:18.976
I'm considering a business proposition that
were put to me by a lad on the inside.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.614
Yeah, admit it, you already
think I'm a dickhead.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.450
The lad's a Dutch kid
called Dirk.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.719
Dirk.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.389
He'd already been inside seven months
when I got there, and 11 left.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.558
- What were he in for?
- Possession.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.194
He'd been running club nights back
home in Holland since he were 17,

16:35.195 --> 16:37.363
decided to come here and try
his luck at the same thing.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.298
Why?

16:39.299 --> 16:42.368
Misguided romantic notions of England
being the home of dance music.

16:42.369 --> 16:45.170
His problem was, he didn't realize
that Leeds ain't Amsterdam.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.606
Too fucking right.
When the local police sussed...

16:47.607 --> 16:50.075
the reason his club was so popular
were because the foreign manager...

16:50.076 --> 16:52.778
were flooding the dance floor with cut-price
Dutch E's, they had a stroll down.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.114
Oh, dear.
That's what his dad said.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.615
Although his dad's
an high court barrister,

16:56.616 --> 16:59.151
so he was bound to be a bit
upset at the embarrassment.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.221
However, he ain't
disowned the boy.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.323
He's offered to help him
get started in a business,

17:04.324 --> 17:07.159
knowing how an ex-con is shafted
for career prospects.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.428
- That's nice of him.
- Those people are laid back, Dodd.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.630
His terms are...

17:11.631 --> 17:14.633
Dirk goes back to Holland,
promises to stop being a twat,

17:14.634 --> 17:17.469
and finds a way to match his dad's
investment, show him he's serious.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.506
- What's the business?
- Coffee shop.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.242
In the tourist center of Amsterdam.

17:23.242 --> 17:25.077
Solid reputation, managing to
maintain a good profit even now.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.179
How much is it?

17:27.180 --> 17:30.749
He's accepted Dirk's offer of
110 grand English. Bargain.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.551
Offer's good for a month.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.454
- Where do you come into it?
- He's asked me to come in with him.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.223
With money?
Yeah, Dodd, with money.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.259
What does he think
your parents do?

17:40.260 --> 17:42.261
He knows I ain't got 55 grand.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.197
Knows I can't
get it on my own.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.067
He's happy for me to bring my
three best mates into the deal.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.570
- Oh, that's good of him.
- There's still a problem.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.205
What?

17:53.206 --> 17:56.141
We haven't got 50-odd grand either.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.275
No.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.411
But Steven Roper does.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.589
I don't think he's going to give you
a loan, if I'm honest with you.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.724
I don't give a fuck
what he won't give me.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.927
He owes me for a fucking year,
and he'll pay me for that year.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.200
You were never
an idiot, Harvey.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.368
So I'm going to assume
there's some logic here.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.370
Yeah, there is.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.639
Maybe I should
give you a little background.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.708
Are you aware of the details
of my case?

18:29.709 --> 18:32.511
You were released
from prison six weeks ago,

18:32.512 --> 18:34.313
having served half
of a two-year sentence...

18:34.314 --> 18:37.116
for possession of heroin
with intent to supply.

18:37.117 --> 18:39.151
First offense of any kind.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.752
I can tell you
with a straight face--

18:40.753 --> 18:42.721
I've never supplied
anything to anyone.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.458
Only seen heroin once
in my entire life.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.128
What do you know
about Steven Roper?

18:49.129 --> 18:51.163
He's not a very nice man.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.399
He's done time for assault and
robbery, but that was some time ago,

18:54.400 --> 18:58.303
because he is now a legitimate businessman
running an industrial security firm...

18:58.304 --> 19:00.172
out of the Rise Estate.

19:00.173 --> 19:05.344
However, it has been speculated that
he's involved in drug trafficking.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.146
Speculated?

19:07.147 --> 19:09.548
We haven't been able to build a
solid enough case against him.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.750
- Why do you think that is?
- Maybe he's a lot smarter...

19:11.751 --> 19:14.586
than we'd like to give
a two-bob thug credit for.

19:14.587 --> 19:18.757
Steven Roper employs a well-considered
set of diversionary tactics.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.693
- You can't seem to counter them.
- Diversionary tactics?

19:21.694 --> 19:23.896
There's a lofty title--
nothing like giving it credence.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.231
The money's coming in, and you
can't seem to counter it.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.333
All right, Harvey,
I'm listening.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.436
Why don't you tell me about Steven
Roper's diversionary tactics?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.438
You're a detective, Inspector. I'm
sure you're familiar with them.

19:33.439 --> 19:36.241
I'm old, forgetful.
Why don't you jog me memory?

19:36.242 --> 19:37.943
Okay. Step 1:

19:37.944 --> 19:41.578
The controlling influence
of fear.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.954
If you have built a consortium of
commission-based contraband vendors,

19:48.955 --> 19:51.356
you run the risk of being
name-dropped to the police...

19:51.357 --> 19:53.625
if those in your charge
be faced with incarceration.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.395
Also, there are those who may wish
to make money on your behalf...

19:56.396 --> 19:59.865
and then forget to pay their dues,
of which examples must be made.

19:59.866 --> 20:04.336
While there are guns, their use
brings unwanted police attention.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.673
This being the case, the sensible criminal
maintains a fearsome reputation...

20:07.674 --> 20:10.540
with good old-fashioned
hard graft.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.919
Step 2: Evading detection.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.489
Though the clandestine art of
surveillance exemplified by the police...

20:24.490 --> 20:28.627
owes little to the techniques employed by
government agents in acts of espionage,

20:28.628 --> 20:32.362
their constant presence still
requires creative vigilance.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.436
The trick is to keep the gear
moving from place to place...

20:37.437 --> 20:39.404
so that even if the law
tracks its whereabouts,

20:39.405 --> 20:42.305
it's long gone before
they can do anything about it.

20:49.815 --> 20:52.684
Of course, police incompetence
can't take all the blame.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.886
After all, the
drug squad must be short staffed,

20:54.887 --> 20:58.188
what with all the traffic violations
requiring their manpower.

20:58.657 --> 21:02.494
Step 3: Building a case
for citizen harassment.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.865
You lot like nothing more than to have
someone else do your job for you,

21:06.866 --> 21:10.167
which is why you are such big
fans of the telephone tip-off.

21:10.836 --> 21:13.605
If the drug squad receive a call
from a concerned citizen...

21:13.606 --> 21:16.875
giving details of a drug cache at
a residence in a problem area,

21:16.876 --> 21:19.745
they will generally act
on the information.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.746
Police!

21:24.284 --> 21:27.019
Of course, the trick is to make the
anonymous phone call yourself...

21:27.020 --> 21:29.955
after you have made sure there is nothing
even resembling an aspirin on the property.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.624
So you can laugh as you watch
the boys in blue...

21:32.625 --> 21:35.360
sweat as they tear apart
your house to no avail.

21:36.996 --> 21:41.465
Why are you so fucking worried?
It's fucking bollocks!

21:43.335 --> 21:46.705
When they finally call off the search,
your house will be in such a state...

21:46.706 --> 21:49.474
as to warrant a generous compensation
payment from the taxpayer,

21:49.475 --> 21:52.477
amid claims that your reputation
has been unfairly tainted.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.414
Repeat this procedure four times
over a 12-month period...

21:55.415 --> 21:58.317
and you can rest assured that even the fire
brigade wouldn't dare enter your property...

21:58.318 --> 22:00.884
if the whole fucking street
were ablaze.

22:01.987 --> 22:06.825
Step 4: Throw the dog a bone.
This is where I come in.

22:06.826 --> 22:10.662
The drug squad needs to fill a certain
quota of arrests and seized quantities...

22:10.663 --> 22:12.431
to prove it's keeping
the streets of England...

22:12.432 --> 22:15.500
as clean as the Armitage Shanks
in Buckingham Palace.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.370
By the same token, the criminal
needs the drug squad...

22:18.371 --> 22:21.506
to have the inclination to continue
helping them perpetrate Step 3,

22:21.507 --> 22:25.110
so, every now and then, a big chimp
will stitch up a little monkey.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.880
I'm the monkey.
Steven Roper was the big chimp.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.950
In this particular example of the
successful execution of Step 4,

22:31.951 --> 22:34.986
I came home from a night on the piss
to find my flat had been broken into.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.822
A quick look around
told me two things:

22:36.823 --> 22:38.790
One, there were no burglars
in the flat.

22:38.791 --> 22:42.494
Two, the stupid fuckers hadn't
stolen anything when they had been.

22:42.495 --> 22:43.995
I didn't see what were coming.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.831
In my defense,
I were fucking rat-assed.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.467
It being January I was also
cold, so I closed the door.

22:48.468 --> 22:51.136
Police! Police! Put the phone down!
Put it down!

22:51.137 --> 22:54.439
Acting on an anonymous tip-off, your
boys came flying into the house,

22:54.440 --> 22:56.408
armed with a search warrant.

22:56.409 --> 22:59.845
It took them about 30 seconds to
find the 200 grams of heroin...

22:59.846 --> 23:02.746
I had so cleverly hidden underneath
the TV Guide <i>on the desk.</i>

23:04.384 --> 23:06.985
It took the jury even less time
to find me guilty of the charge,

23:06.986 --> 23:09.921
as the only evidence to back up my claim
that someone had broken into the flat...

23:09.922 --> 23:13.425
and planted the drugs had been
destroyed by the police battering ram.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.827
No further interest
were taken into my plight.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.930
Well, there is certainly
authenticity to what you're saying.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.600
If you're familiar with the methods,
why don't you do something?

23:21.601 --> 23:23.435
Because they work,
like you said.

23:23.436 --> 23:27.105
I've got to wonder how a decent,
upstanding citizen like yourself...

23:27.106 --> 23:29.941
understands the intricacies
of small-time drug trafficking.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.743
It's not rocket science.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.679
No, it's easy money.
That's why you do it.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.849
I'm not getting
the year back either way.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.718
Just trying to paint
a better picture.

23:39.719 --> 23:42.888
Fair enough.
Go on.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.056
Where was I?

23:45.057 --> 23:46.958
I don't give a fuck
what he won't give me.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.594
He owes me for a fucking year,
and he'll pay me for that year.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.730
You were never
an idiot, Harvey.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.865
So I'm going to assume
there's some logic here.

23:53.866 --> 23:56.634
Yeah, there is.

23:58.604 --> 24:02.007
Got their heads up their ass, mate,
so they can stay low on the radar.

24:02.008 --> 24:04.976
I never had much
to say to any other inmates.

24:04.977 --> 24:08.480
That don't mean my ear weren't constantly
bent in the favor of prison pastimes.

24:08.481 --> 24:11.616
Believe me, if these clowns
knew the half of it,

24:11.617 --> 24:13.752
I'd be doing 20 easy.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.353
Giving it the big "I am."

24:17.088 --> 24:20.525
Their problem is,
they forget who you are.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.927
Think you're old,
think you're a joke.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.132
In prison, it was
all you hear night and day.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.034
You get sly enough to learn
to block it out.

24:29.035 --> 24:32.070
Soon stopped smiling when
he saw the fucking sawed-off.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.973
Soon lost his heart as well.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.576
Although I don't think
they care if you're listening anyway.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.578
I drop off all over the north.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.913
Even the biggest twats from
the smallest two-rip town...

24:41.914 --> 24:44.549
would have a wedge
the size of your mother's ass.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.818
Take this one guy from this filthy
nowhere estate over yonder.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.054
The Rise,
I think they call it.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.623
Of course you prick up your ears
when you get wind of something interesting.

24:51.624 --> 24:55.560
I'd drop a key off to this twat called
Steve, first Monday of every month.

24:55.561 --> 24:58.663
Flash bastard, would open
this big green safe,

24:58.664 --> 25:01.833
and he'd take the cash from a pile
that high like it was pocket change.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.936
Pass it over with a wink and a "what
the fuck are you smiling at?"

25:04.937 --> 25:08.073
Now, he always had
a four-strong team around him,

25:08.074 --> 25:10.108
but you pull the right tool
at the right time,

25:10.109 --> 25:14.546
and you can liberate the content of
his belongings, smart as you like.

25:14.547 --> 25:17.182
Great. Roper
keeps his money in a safe.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.251
The man lives in that office
since he got into security.

25:19.252 --> 25:21.553
I think he'd notice us popping
in, trying to hacksaw it open.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.588
Safe can't be in his office.

25:23.589 --> 25:25.891
The Scouser said he used a
meat-delivery van as his cover,

25:25.892 --> 25:30.562
so he'd only drop at suitable places--
restaurants or big pubs that serve food.

25:30.563 --> 25:33.899
No, the only place round here
that fits the description...

25:33.900 --> 25:36.333
is the Rise Club.

25:41.139 --> 25:44.209
Okay. The club makes sense
as a dropping point.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.078
But why would Roper leave his money
in there, not in his own office?

25:47.079 --> 25:49.114
He doesn't own the club.

25:49.115 --> 25:52.017
Albert's in his pocket, and it puts some
distance between him and his money...

25:52.018 --> 25:54.686
in case he ever gets
his collar felt.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.855
I suppose his firm
looks after the club,

25:56.856 --> 26:00.659
so he thinks it's safe there as
in his own office. Even more so.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.895
According to this bloke, the safe's in a
basement office with no windows, one entrance,

26:03.896 --> 26:06.131
and the door's secured
like a bank vault.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.866
How much are we
talking there?

26:07.867 --> 26:10.066
At least 60 grand.

26:15.206 --> 26:19.277
- Tiger Woods without the birds.
- Fuck off.

26:19.278 --> 26:22.180
How do you know the Scouser
ain't just talkin' out of his ass?

26:22.181 --> 26:24.649
Be a good guess
if he just made it all up.

26:24.650 --> 26:27.252
But you don't know for sure?
No, but I'll find out.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.621
How? It's the first
Monday of March next week.

26:29.622 --> 26:32.190
If the meat van makes a delivery
to the pub, we'll know it's sound.

26:32.191 --> 26:35.160
We can stake out the pub from the flat.
No, we'll need more than that.

26:35.161 --> 26:38.263
The van turns up, all it will prove
is it used to be a meat delivery van.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.132
We need to get in the office, see
if there's a green safe there.

26:41.133 --> 26:44.869
If there is, we'll know he wasn't
lying, be ours for the taking.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.672
Jesus Christ. Are you lot taking the piss?
Look, Harvey.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.841
I know Roper fucked you
right up the ass.

26:49.842 --> 26:53.612
But for Christ's sake, drug money?
Safe cracking? Fuck off.

26:53.613 --> 26:57.282
- Why dismiss it straight off? -Because we're
not safe-crackers or cat burglars, are we?

26:57.283 --> 26:59.351
Or coffee shop owners,
for that matter.

26:59.352 --> 27:02.287
Harvey's not a smack dealer,
but he did time for it.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.957
Somebody does this stuff, so it can be done.
Why can't we be the ones to do it?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.826
Because we won't know
where to fucking start.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.328
It's not the type of thing
you want to fuck up, is it?

27:10.329 --> 27:11.930
Come on, Charlie.
We're just talking here.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.265
No, we're not.
We're serious.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.335
- What? Just pack up and piss off abroad just like that?
- Yeah.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.204
And you're not
taking the piss?

27:19.205 --> 27:22.374
- You can come back and visit.
- Oh, come on. This is our home, mate.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.209
I know.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.344
I'll understand
if you don't want to do it.

27:26.345 --> 27:30.248
But if we do, we've got a
share in a proper business.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.782
All in it together.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.787
It'll mean a new start
for everyone.

27:35.788 --> 27:39.891
But on the upside, it will
mean a new start for everyone.

27:39.892 --> 27:43.728
Fuckin' hell, Dempsey. An hour ago, you were
the sort of man who were content with life.

27:43.729 --> 27:47.365
Now you're talking about pulling off some
crackpot robbery and escaping around the world?

27:47.366 --> 27:52.804
Skint old birds knocking on the door at the
crack of dawn looking for cheap fags...

27:52.805 --> 27:54.906
and a fortnightly trip
down to the Joke Shop.

27:54.907 --> 27:58.143
Lovely. I'll-- I'll take another
10 years, please. Bollocks.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.844
Talkin' about your fuckin'--
So what?

27:59.845 --> 28:02.013
You're so in love with stacking
crates in that freezer...

28:02.014 --> 28:05.216
two nights a week on agency pay, not
willing to consider your options?

28:05.217 --> 28:07.218
That's just temporary,
you fucking prick.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.120
I'm a qualified
fucking welder,

28:09.121 --> 28:11.756
and when it picks back up
and the factory's reopened--

28:11.757 --> 28:14.359
There'll be machines turning in there
before your factory's reopened!

28:14.360 --> 28:17.228
Go fuck yourself, Demps! At
least I've got a fucking trade!

28:17.229 --> 28:20.098
And turn your nose up at me? I've
worked hard for what I've got.

28:20.099 --> 28:23.168
What was it you got?
A C.S.C.S. card,

28:23.169 --> 28:26.271
a broken promise and a chip
on your fucking shoulder!

28:26.272 --> 28:29.708
Such a fucking prick! Can't even
start about you, you fucking ponce!

28:29.709 --> 28:33.812
All I'm saying is, wouldn't you rather pack it
all in and go and sit in a nice, warm café,

28:33.813 --> 28:36.881
watching the world go by, chatting
to tourists-- Oh, fuck off.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.918
It's a bit of a pipe
dream in all fairness, Harvey.

28:39.919 --> 28:44.122
What if it's not? What if
the money is in that safe?

28:44.123 --> 28:46.723
It's our chance
to have something of our own.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.927
I'm not saying
it's not worth a look.

28:48.928 --> 28:51.561
And if it looks good?
I don't know.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.833
Think about doing it.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.469
Charlie?

28:57.470 --> 28:59.370
You lot are off
your fucking heads!

28:59.371 --> 29:02.672
Hey.
Hey, come on, Charlie.

29:03.942 --> 29:08.678
Leave him, mate, He's
got to make up his own mind.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.950
So, what do we do now?

29:14.753 --> 29:16.986
Wait till Monday.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.702
Harvey.
Not going to say hello?

29:33.838 --> 29:37.574
I'm not going anywhere,
so you may as well look at me.

29:39.811 --> 29:44.349
Still handsome. Thought maybe
you'd have a few scars now.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.851
Only the kind
you can't see.

29:46.852 --> 29:49.554
- How are you, Steve?
- Steven.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.856
Been worse. Yourself?

29:51.857 --> 29:54.257
Not too bad.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.995
Well, it's been fun
catching up.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.230
I don't want to have to
worry about you, Harvey.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.065
Your concern moves me.

30:01.066 --> 30:04.369
Don't get fucking smart.

30:04.370 --> 30:08.840
I get the impression you blame me for that spot
of bother you got yourself into last year.

30:08.841 --> 30:11.009
That's fine.
Believe what you like.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.946
But bear in mind, I don't react
well when I feel threatened.

30:14.947 --> 30:17.849
Is that why you're always
such an asshole?

30:17.850 --> 30:19.851
Have that one.
Stay where you are.

30:19.852 --> 30:23.488
Tell me, is it hard living
in a constant state of fear?

30:23.489 --> 30:26.024
Fucking flying
if you think I'm scared of you.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.092
No, you're not scared of me.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.262
You're scared if you loosen your grip
on what's yours for even a second,

30:31.263 --> 30:33.198
someone's going to come
along and take it all away.

30:33.199 --> 30:34.866
Is that right?
Yeah.

30:34.867 --> 30:37.200
And you know what?
What?

30:38.236 --> 30:40.937
You fucking should be.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.025
Come on.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.827
Oh-- No! Fuck!

31:08.132 --> 31:10.435
I'll have you.

31:10.436 --> 31:13.137
It's not much fun for me listening to
you play on that thing, all right?

31:13.138 --> 31:15.340
Put the comedy channel on or something.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.275
When I'm on sentry,
you can do what you like.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.244
When's that then?
Twenty-three minutes.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.146
Fuck's sake.

31:22.147 --> 31:25.350
- Any sign?
- Not yet.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.585
But it's still early doors.

31:27.586 --> 31:30.255
- Go on, mate.
- I'll have him.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.557
- Right, I'll get the kettle on.
- Yes.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.526
Hey, watch out!
Oh, shit.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.964
Fucking wanker.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.432
It's in excellent condition,

31:41.433 --> 31:46.102
but there's a small chip
on the back unfortunately.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.540
It's a plate with
a big chip in it.

31:49.541 --> 31:51.910
Who's going to buy that
for 70 quid?

31:51.911 --> 31:54.913
You'd be surprised, mate. If
Winston Churchill ate off it,

31:54.914 --> 31:56.948
it'd be worth
a hundred times that.

31:56.949 --> 31:59.117
It's a Princess Di
commemorative plate, Dempsey.

31:59.118 --> 32:01.417
Just saying.

32:02.353 --> 32:04.956
Hey up, lads.
We got a live one.

32:04.957 --> 32:06.591
"Mikey's Meat."

32:06.592 --> 32:09.160
It's-- It's Mickey's Meat.
What's the difference?

32:09.161 --> 32:10.960
The "C."

32:13.064 --> 32:16.134
Ah. Is that how
butchers dress these days?

32:16.135 --> 32:20.038
Well, hello, soldier.

32:20.039 --> 32:24.107
Look who it is, Harvey. It's your best mate.
Want to go down to say hello?

32:25.009 --> 32:27.478
It's the first Monday in March,

32:27.479 --> 32:32.050
got a meat delivery man who looks
fuck all like a meat delivery man,

32:32.051 --> 32:34.686
and super Steven Roper
heading up his welcome wagon.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.455
It's beginning to look
a bit like Christmas.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.590
A lot like Christmas, Dodd.

32:39.591 --> 32:43.061
- Come on, man!
- We're on.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.996
A fucking <i>lot</i> like Christmas.

32:44.997 --> 32:47.764
What's the
difference, dickhead?

32:48.099 --> 32:50.335
<i>I've missed this.</i>

32:50.336 --> 32:54.305
Missed what?
You walking me to work.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.608
Two buses and an eight-minute walk from
the estate, just for the privilege.

32:57.609 --> 33:02.011
I'm glad it's appreciated. I'm sure
I can find a way to say thank you.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.549
Oh, yeah.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.984
The flat could do with a cleaning.
Uh, no.

33:08.753 --> 33:11.089
What's your plan?

33:11.090 --> 33:13.624
What plan?
Your life plan.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.460
Oh.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.496
You've adjusted to normal life. You
have restarted a relationship.

33:18.497 --> 33:22.865
So now you've just got to decide where
you're going to take your life.

33:23.534 --> 33:26.235
I haven't given it
much thought.

33:26.604 --> 33:28.971
You're lying.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.480
I know how hard
it's going to be, but...

33:35.481 --> 33:37.548
do you have to do it alone?

33:37.549 --> 33:39.816
I know.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.587
I know, I just--

33:42.588 --> 33:45.121
just need a little time.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.559
Yeah, I know.

33:49.694 --> 33:53.129
Don't take too long, eh?

34:18.589 --> 34:21.056
See you later, mate.

35:12.844 --> 35:17.179
Hey!
What's Harvey planning?

35:17.448 --> 35:19.217
Your mate Harvey.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.718
What's he planning to do
to get back at me?

35:20.719 --> 35:22.520
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.889
If someone stuck me
behind bars for a year,

35:24.890 --> 35:27.158
I'd make it my life's work
to track him down...

35:27.159 --> 35:29.327
and watch him bleed out
through a hole in the face.

35:29.328 --> 35:33.129
Look, I've only seen him once since he
got out, and he hasn't said anything!

35:33.865 --> 35:36.667
I'm going to give you
a message to give to Harvey.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.804
Now, you tell him that prison
might have been a nightmare,

35:39.805 --> 35:43.406
but me,
I am fucking horrendous!

35:43.774 --> 35:45.443
I'll tell him.

35:45.444 --> 35:49.178
Oh, I know you will.

35:50.615 --> 35:53.549
No!

36:07.165 --> 36:09.534
Let me out! Hey!

36:09.535 --> 36:12.368
Hey! Let--

36:43.301 --> 36:45.603
What's up?
Is Albert here?

36:45.604 --> 36:47.905
Yeah, let's see
if he's still here.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.369
Can I have a bit more
here and all, please?

37:51.370 --> 37:53.769
Yeah, no problem.

38:25.803 --> 38:28.305
Who is it? Stan.

38:31.409 --> 38:34.412
You've got a visitor.

38:34.413 --> 38:37.113
Sit down.

38:38.082 --> 38:41.317
Thanks, Stan.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.848
Is that an original?

39:16.554 --> 39:19.390
What are you after, Harvey?

39:19.391 --> 39:21.392
Let's not piss about.
I'm a busy man.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.794
I just wanted a chat. What
do you want to chat about?

39:23.795 --> 39:26.097
- My membership.
- You don't have a membership.

39:26.098 --> 39:28.499
But I used to.
I'd like to again.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.836
Now why would I want to give a convicted
drug dealer membership to my club?

39:31.837 --> 39:33.971
Or even the privilege
of drinking in it?

39:33.972 --> 39:35.706
I'm not a dealer, Albert.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.075
And if I had been,
I paid for it.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.977
I just want things
to get back to normal.

39:39.978 --> 39:43.414
I can understand that.
I really can.

39:43.415 --> 39:45.850
Okay, so, do you need time
to think about it or--

39:45.851 --> 39:49.086
No, I'll be quick
and I'll be honest.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.589
I wouldn't give a bollock if the
queen walked through that door...

39:51.590 --> 39:53.824
and gave you
a full pardon right now.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.826
Your membership's
staying in the bin.

39:55.827 --> 39:58.396
The only reason you ever had it
in the first place...

39:58.397 --> 40:01.699
was 'cause it was grandfathered in and
the committee wouldn't refuse you.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.801
I don't like you, Harvey.

40:03.802 --> 40:07.171
I don't really know why.
I just don't.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.140
I never liked
your little mates either.

40:09.141 --> 40:12.510
Smug little bastards,
the lot of you.

40:12.511 --> 40:16.113
You can call me all the twats under the sun
if you like, but that's the way it is.

40:16.114 --> 40:20.484
Albert,
the past is the past.

40:20.485 --> 40:22.853
If I acted in a certain way,
I apologize.

40:22.854 --> 40:26.089
All I want is the chance
to wipe the slate clean.

40:28.058 --> 40:31.729
That... probably didn't
help my case, did it?

40:31.730 --> 40:35.433
- It's time for you to leave.
- That were an accident, okay? I weren't being petty.

40:35.434 --> 40:38.502
Yeah? Maybe that's
your problem, Harvey.

40:38.503 --> 40:41.872
You rub the wrong people up the wrong
way even when you're having a day off.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.675
Cost you dear in the past.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.744
Cost you even more
in the future, lad.

40:46.745 --> 40:50.548
- So you're saying there's no chance then?
- Not a sniff.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.850
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to take a piss.

40:52.851 --> 40:56.620
Only went five minutes ago.

40:56.621 --> 41:00.356
Must be the sound
of running water.

41:01.559 --> 41:04.195
Shame you wasted
your time, Harvey.

41:04.196 --> 41:05.917
No. It were a pleasure.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.670
I couldn't wait to
tell the lads I'd seen the safe.

41:12.671 --> 41:16.941
I don't think I'd been that excited by
a sense of discovery since I were 11,

41:16.942 --> 41:20.083
realized an erection weren't just
for just pissing over high walls.

41:22.513 --> 41:25.514
Didn't last long.

41:27.551 --> 41:30.154
Where's Charlie? He's through there.
You can't go in.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.990
His doctor's holding him.
Sit down.

41:32.991 --> 41:36.026
How bad is it?
It's all right.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.696
He's all right? Obviously, he's a bit
fucked or he wouldn't be in here.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.731
Listen.

41:40.732 --> 41:44.168
He's conscious. The nurses said his burns
are not as bad as we first thought.

41:44.169 --> 41:47.849
But he's on a respirator because his
lungs are fucked from all the smoke.

41:49.607 --> 41:53.075
Harvey, it's gonna be all right.
What happened?

41:54.178 --> 41:57.648
Police told the nurse he'd been
dragged out of a burning lockup.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.683
He'd been locked in
and he'd taken a hiding.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.819
Have they arrested Roper?

42:01.820 --> 42:03.687
Charlie wouldn't
talk to them.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.155
We'll fucking talk.
We know who did it.

42:05.156 --> 42:07.658
We can guess.

42:07.659 --> 42:09.894
- There's no witnesses. What are they gonna do?
- This is attempted murder.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.896
No.

42:11.897 --> 42:14.198
It's some dickhead they
couldn't give a fuck about...

42:14.199 --> 42:16.567
with smoke in his chest
and his mouth shut.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.935
They're not going to put
a task force on it, Harvey.

42:20.804 --> 42:24.108
Bollocks to the police then.
We know where Roper's gonna be.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.277
If we go now,
he won't even see us coming.

42:26.278 --> 42:30.014
All right, Dodd. We're all upset here,
but let's not be fucking stupid.

42:30.015 --> 42:32.850
I'm just thinking about Charlie,
lying in there,

42:32.851 --> 42:34.752
shitting himself
at what's just happened to him.

42:34.753 --> 42:36.720
Where's your mind, eh?

42:36.721 --> 42:39.223
Fuck off, Dodd! I'm thinking
about Charlie as well.

42:39.224 --> 42:41.725
So we're not gonna do nothing?
Look--

42:41.726 --> 42:45.596
Look, right now, we've gotta wait
here, make sure Charlie's all right.

42:45.597 --> 42:47.763
Fuck that.

44:12.016 --> 44:14.816
There's a few
quids worth of kit here.

44:16.220 --> 44:19.154
Starting to see
where all my money goes.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.926
How are you, mate?

44:27.264 --> 44:29.700
Never better.

44:29.701 --> 44:33.070
I'm serious.
They've given me morphine.

44:33.071 --> 44:36.972
Smackheads aren't as big a set
of twats as you might think.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.113
I'm so sorry, Charlie.

44:43.114 --> 44:46.016
- It's not your fault.
- It is.

44:46.017 --> 44:49.019
Roper's an asshole.
He did this to get back at you.

44:49.020 --> 44:51.255
What did you ever do to him...

44:51.256 --> 44:53.924
but get engaged to a bird
who knocked him back?

44:53.925 --> 44:56.460
It's not your fault
he's an asshole.

44:56.461 --> 44:59.897
And it's not your... fault
that we're mates.

44:59.898 --> 45:03.033
If I just...

45:03.034 --> 45:05.769
kept my mouth shut when I saw him
the other day-- Fuck off, Harvey.

45:05.770 --> 45:08.205
You're not having that one.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.907
If anyone's gonna feel sorry for
themselves, it's me, all right?

45:20.951 --> 45:26.154
So, brave little soldier
all wounded,

45:27.157 --> 45:29.293
must be getting a bit of
attention from the ladies.

45:29.294 --> 45:32.863
Oh, yeah. It's been like
the Playboy Mansion in here.

45:32.864 --> 45:35.232
What are your nurses like?

45:35.233 --> 45:37.301
Fat, foreign
and fucking ugly.

45:37.302 --> 45:39.203
Your missus
on the wards today?

45:39.204 --> 45:41.505
Yeah, she's on nights.
She'll be here somewhere.

45:41.506 --> 45:45.909
Fuck off and find her.
Leave me to my painkillers.

45:45.910 --> 45:47.745
Is it really bad?

45:47.746 --> 45:52.180
No. I just like them.

45:53.450 --> 45:57.853
Now go home. It's the middle
of the fucking night.

46:02.326 --> 46:05.661
I'll, uh--
I'll be back tomorrow.

46:12.836 --> 46:16.473
Did you get a snoop around
in the office?

46:16.474 --> 46:17.808
Uh, yeah.

46:17.809 --> 46:21.512
- Safe there?
- Yeah.

46:21.513 --> 46:23.912
So, are we on, or what?

46:24.348 --> 46:26.150
We, Charlie?

46:26.151 --> 46:31.321
I'll be out in less than a week.
A trio of twats like you?

46:31.322 --> 46:34.022
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

46:34.424 --> 46:37.659
We'll be waiting for you.

46:40.064 --> 46:42.132
The job were a go.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.068
Roper trying to kill one of us put any
wavering thoughts we had straight to bed.

46:45.069 --> 46:48.071
Which is the opposite
of what he intended.

46:48.072 --> 46:50.941
If Roper was willing to attempt
murder to make a point,

46:50.942 --> 46:54.478
wouldn't your failure to visibly
appease him elicit recourse?

46:54.479 --> 46:56.313
We never gave his name
to police.

46:56.314 --> 46:58.949
We may not have packed up and left,
but he had no reason to believe...

46:58.950 --> 47:01.018
we weren't quietly
capitulating.

47:01.019 --> 47:04.054
But you weren't
quietly capitulating.

47:04.055 --> 47:06.056
What were you doing?

47:06.057 --> 47:07.858
Quietly planning.

47:07.859 --> 47:10.594
We've got to be ready to go on the 8th.
Two weeks Sunday.

47:10.595 --> 47:14.064
Why then?
Easter weekend.

47:14.065 --> 47:16.466
Fuck.
The members' excursion.

47:16.467 --> 47:19.837
The what?
Rise Club trip.

47:19.838 --> 47:24.107
Club trip to them. Thirty-five coach-loads
of people in a convoy to Blackpool to us.

47:24.108 --> 47:25.909
That's half the estate.

47:25.910 --> 47:29.446
Lot less people to stumble on
what we're doing. Pigging hell!

47:29.447 --> 47:32.349
As it's a religious holiday, not only
will the estate be a ghost town,

47:32.350 --> 47:35.185
the club will be closed by
10:00, locked up by 11:00.

47:35.186 --> 47:38.021
Yeah, but the coach will be back
soon after, always before midnight.

47:38.022 --> 47:40.190
Never before 11:00--
closer to half past.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.559
Gives us a window.
A fucking small window.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.595
Which means we got
to get it right.

47:44.596 --> 47:46.296
No room for mistakes. None.

47:46.297 --> 47:48.265
Roper won't be headin' off
on the trip though.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.133
No. You can be
sure of that.

47:50.134 --> 47:53.503
Is that Martin?
It fucking is.

47:53.504 --> 47:56.104
That robbing bastard.

47:56.340 --> 47:58.175
What's that about?

47:58.176 --> 48:01.879
He gave him 80 quid for a
knockoff PS3 couple of weeks ago.

48:01.880 --> 48:04.448
Turns out it was an empty display
shell stuffed with lead shot.

48:04.449 --> 48:07.749
Remember that PlayStation
you sold me, do you?

48:08.986 --> 48:11.321
It's imaginative, I'll give him that.
Shall we give him a hand?

48:11.322 --> 48:13.456
No, he looks fine.

48:14.292 --> 48:16.460
Going to hospital
to see Billy Bragg there?

48:16.461 --> 48:19.363
Yeah.
Taking Nicola out after.

48:19.364 --> 48:21.965
Oh.
Going anywhere nice?

48:25.003 --> 48:27.905
He'll be out in a couple of days.
He's a tough lad.

48:27.906 --> 48:30.340
He's a <i>lucky</i> one.

48:30.341 --> 48:32.542
Depends which way
you look at it.

48:32.543 --> 48:36.213
Harvey. Promise me
you won't do anything stupid.

48:36.214 --> 48:38.215
I won't do anything stupid.

48:38.216 --> 48:40.050
Look at me.

48:40.051 --> 48:43.587
I won't do anything stupid, okay?
I swear on your life.

48:43.588 --> 48:46.390
On my life?
Oh, that is chivalrous.

48:46.391 --> 48:48.492
You can't swear on your own.

48:48.493 --> 48:51.793
It's got to be the ones
you care most about.

48:56.600 --> 49:00.003
Have you told your parents you've
been seeing me since I got out?

49:00.004 --> 49:02.137
Yeah, I told my mum.

49:03.073 --> 49:04.708
Dad wouldn't approve.

49:04.709 --> 49:08.979
Since when have you worried about
me mum and dad?

49:08.980 --> 49:12.616
Seven months we were together, and
you still refused to meet them.

49:12.617 --> 49:15.152
- Never felt like the right time.
- On my 18th birthday party?

49:15.153 --> 49:17.187
See, that is--
that's more of a family affair.

49:17.188 --> 49:20.468
- My mum loved you.
- It weren't your mum I were worried about.

49:23.093 --> 49:26.530
But you're right. My dad never approved of you.
So... why do you care now?

49:26.531 --> 49:29.431
Now I can't change his mind.

49:34.237 --> 49:36.772
Has your mum
got in touch yet?

49:37.040 --> 49:39.409
No. She won't.

49:39.410 --> 49:42.911
I know she hurt you, but
not everyone will do the same.

49:45.082 --> 49:47.517
The things I said before
I went inside--

49:47.518 --> 49:52.756
I know you and Roper never-- Yeah, I know.
Don't matter.

49:52.757 --> 49:55.423
It does.

49:55.726 --> 49:57.694
Let's just forget about it.

49:57.695 --> 50:00.228
Can you?

50:00.263 --> 50:02.964
Yeah, I can try.

50:16.179 --> 50:18.580
I still love you.

50:47.310 --> 50:50.447
This isn't just
any fucking bird, pal.

50:50.448 --> 50:52.382
This is Nicola.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.751
Are you telling me you can
just walk away without a word?

50:54.752 --> 50:56.453
I don't have a choice.

50:56.454 --> 51:00.856
What's it going to do to her
if you just disappear?

51:05.128 --> 51:09.448
Remember how I told you they were going to put
me through management training at Weyland?

51:11.268 --> 51:16.339
But you went from bottom floor
to office, so I'm proud of you.

51:16.340 --> 51:19.543
It were a good job.
Good money too.

51:19.544 --> 51:22.312
I were gonna get a flat in
town for me and Nicola.

51:22.313 --> 51:27.451
Don't do this, Harvey.
Don't dwell on it.

51:27.452 --> 51:29.786
We're moving forward.
I didn't tell you.

51:29.787 --> 51:33.090
There was a Mr. Stewart, the M.D.
He said if I topped out the course,

51:33.091 --> 51:34.658
put me through on
the H.E. scheme,

51:34.659 --> 51:38.462
I'd have full-time management
pay, I'd work toward an LL.B.

51:38.463 --> 51:43.233
When I finished that, he said I'd move into
legal to do an L.P.C. and even my articles.

51:43.234 --> 51:46.236
I-- I don't know what
any of that means, mate.

51:46.237 --> 51:50.740
It means before I went inside, I were five paid
years away from being a qualified solicitor.

51:50.741 --> 51:53.241
Me.

51:53.677 --> 51:56.146
I told Nicola.

51:56.147 --> 51:58.115
Man, she was so proud of me.

51:58.116 --> 52:00.884
Week later,
I were arrested,

52:00.885 --> 52:03.753
and all that were left were an
embarrassed look on Mr. Stewart's face.

52:03.754 --> 52:06.323
Poor fucker humiliated
in front of everyone...

52:06.324 --> 52:09.192
for thinking I could be anything more
than the loser they all said I must be.

52:09.193 --> 52:11.228
Roper fucked you.
There's no denying it.

52:11.229 --> 52:14.764
But Nicola hasn't run away.
She knows who you are.

52:14.765 --> 52:17.567
She knows
I'm back at the bottom.

52:17.568 --> 52:19.503
I can't be her charity case.

52:19.504 --> 52:23.204
That's why I pushed her away
before I went inside.

52:24.508 --> 52:26.409
I said
some fucking nasty things.

52:26.410 --> 52:29.446
She came back. Yeah, right
now she's pleased to see me.

52:29.447 --> 52:31.915
Thankfully I'll be gone
before the shine wears off.

52:31.916 --> 52:35.418
I'm not saying you should back out
of the job if she asks you to.

52:35.419 --> 52:38.486
I'm just saying
you should tell her.

52:42.759 --> 52:45.160
Oh.

52:51.935 --> 52:54.370
Third night in a row.

52:58.508 --> 53:02.612
Why don't we just steal
the gear and sell it ourselves?

53:02.613 --> 53:05.382
Who to?
Kids.

53:05.383 --> 53:10.187
Get them hooked on a free trial and laugh
all the way to the bank.

53:10.188 --> 53:13.857
We went over different
scenarios, made lists.

53:13.858 --> 53:15.926
Eventually came up with a plan.

53:15.927 --> 53:19.963
Considering they're not
the most dynamic bunch,

53:19.964 --> 53:24.299
the effort they put in were pretty
bloody impressive.

53:39.983 --> 53:42.650
Here you go, Charles.
Here you go.

53:42.819 --> 53:46.421
- All right.
- Cheers!

54:54.057 --> 54:57.192
At the fucking board,
not me, you prick!

56:48.471 --> 56:50.807
Yeah!

56:50.808 --> 56:53.176
Yeah!

56:53.177 --> 56:56.211
Fuck!

57:31.481 --> 57:33.883
What are you doing here?

57:33.884 --> 57:36.686
What's all this stuff,
Harvey?

57:36.687 --> 57:38.955
- She surprised me at the door.
- And you let her in?

57:38.956 --> 57:40.657
She just barged past.
I couldn't--

57:40.658 --> 57:42.659
So a year in
prison weren't enough?

57:42.660 --> 57:44.994
And you think it's worth
going back, for what?

57:44.995 --> 57:47.163
Robbing a fucking
working men's club?

57:47.164 --> 57:50.567
It's not like that. Okay? No one is going to prison.
We've got this all worked out.

57:50.568 --> 57:53.837
So you break into club, steal Steven
Roper's money, and then what?

57:53.838 --> 57:56.840
Sail away into sunset? No,
it's not how it sounds.

57:56.841 --> 57:59.509
You swore on my life you
were gonna leave this alone.

57:59.510 --> 58:01.945
No, I swore on your life I
wouldn't do anything stupid. Okay?

58:01.946 --> 58:04.948
This isn't stupid. You don't know the facts.
Oh, well, let's see if I do.

58:04.949 --> 58:07.484
If your plan goes wrong,
you go back to prison.

58:07.485 --> 58:09.719
Worse if it isn't the police
that catch you.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.856
If it all goes right, you were just gonna
disappear to another country without a word.

58:12.857 --> 58:15.124
Either way, you were
going to leave me again.

58:15.125 --> 58:18.094
I were gonna phone you when it was all over and explain.
I wanted you to come with me.

58:18.095 --> 58:19.629
Of course you were.
No, it's true!

58:19.630 --> 58:21.598
You're so sweet, Harvey.
It's the truth.

58:21.599 --> 58:23.933
- How am I supposed to know?
- I've never lied to you.

58:23.934 --> 58:26.135
- You've never trusted me either.
- That's not true.

58:26.136 --> 58:28.037
That is the truth.

58:28.038 --> 58:31.107
I really thought it was just an excuse,
that you were going to prison...

58:31.108 --> 58:34.110
and thought it'd be easier if you
didn't have someone waiting for you.

58:34.111 --> 58:37.881
But it weren't, were it? You actually
believed the things you said.

58:37.882 --> 58:39.916
No.
Yeah.

58:39.917 --> 58:42.151
- You didn't trust me then, and you don't trust me now.
- Of course I do.

58:42.152 --> 58:44.888
If you did, you would have
told me what was going on.

58:44.889 --> 58:47.524
- How could I put you at risk?
- If you loved me, you would've asked me to come with you.

58:47.525 --> 58:49.592
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

58:49.593 --> 58:52.794
Because I didn't want to
hear you say no.

58:54.898 --> 58:57.398
You're right.

58:58.067 --> 59:01.336
You're right.
I'd have said no.

59:02.639 --> 59:06.175
I would've asked you to forget about
all this and stay here with me...

59:06.176 --> 59:09.646
because this is fucking stupid,
Harvey, and dangerous,

59:09.647 --> 59:12.615
and I promise you that
if you go ahead with this,

59:12.616 --> 59:15.817
I will not answer
that phone call.

59:16.920 --> 59:19.620
It's your choice.

59:21.024 --> 59:24.025
See, I don't have a choice.

59:30.800 --> 59:33.236
I hope you see sense,
Harvey,

59:33.237 --> 59:37.138
and if you don't I hope you
see the morning after.

59:38.041 --> 59:41.678
What do you want me to do, just
take it on the fucking chin?

59:41.679 --> 59:45.181
I've got no job, no future. Am I
supposed to just fucking swallow it?

59:45.182 --> 59:48.318
No problem, Harvey, mate. Bad luck.
Worse things happen at fucking sea!

59:48.319 --> 59:53.688
Am I supposed to be a
fucking saint or something?

59:59.295 --> 01:00:01.929
I'm sor--

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:04.599
I'm sorry, mate.

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:10.671
If she thought it were a smash-and-grab, she
really would have thought you were an idiot.

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:22.218
It's come
around fast, hasn't it?

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:24.652
The sooner the better.

01:00:25.388 --> 01:00:27.156
Just think.

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:30.827
In 48 hours
we'll be away from here.

01:00:30.828 --> 01:00:32.862
- Good, in't it?
- Is it?

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:36.564
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.068
Just--

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:41.237
We won't be here anymore.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:44.874
We'll be...
somewhere else--

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:47.675
different language,
different money.

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:50.179
We won't even
know anyone.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:53.049
Everybody speaks English,
the Euro's worth 90 pence,

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:55.952
and all three of your best mates
are coming with ya.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:58.853
- I know, but--
- But what?

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.924
- You're not having doubts.
- Not exactly.

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:03.960
- So you <i>are</i> then?
- What if we don't like it?

01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:07.163
What if we <i>do? It's a long way
to go to find out, Demps.</i>

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:10.533
- It's a fucking ferry ride away, mate.
- No, this is our home.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:14.737
I don't know
anything else.

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:17.206
Bricks and concrete.
Same anywhere.

01:01:17.207 --> 01:01:20.243
It's the people,
not the place.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:23.146
- Still a lot to think about.
- You should've thought of that before you quit your job.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:26.914
- Before we put weeks of work into it--
- I'm just saying.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:31.187
Charlie, you've got a face
like a slapped arse.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.823
- You having doubts as well?
- Have I said anything?

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:36.159
No, but you look like you're
going to, so get it out.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.129
You're worried about your mum. Don't think
she'll be able to look after herself.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:43.833
Will she be able to stay off the
piss long enough to get shopping in?

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:47.036
Why don't you fuck yourself and
shut up about my fucking mum!

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.238
I'm not trying to
slag off your mother.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:51.808
But if it's a worry, I want
to know now and not tomorrow,

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:53.710
when we're halfway into job to find
out you've had a change of heart...

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.445
and we're left standing
with our cocks in our hands.

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:58.179
It's not about
my fucking mum!

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:00.817
But I am
fucking worried.

01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:03.119
- What about?
- About fucking the whole thing up.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.823
Christ!
Even if we did,

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:09.859
the police have their heads
stuck so far up their arse...

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.096
that they'd find Shergar before it
dawns on them what we're up to!

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:15.164
Bollocks to the police.
I'm talking about Roper.

01:02:15.165 --> 01:02:17.333
I'm not worried about
that asshole.

01:02:17.334 --> 01:02:21.170
And that's the problem. You're not, but you should be.
He's a fucking psychopath.

01:02:21.171 --> 01:02:24.307
Don't think for one second that
if he tipples us, it won't do us.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:27.243
Together--
What's he gonna do?

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.312
Well, I don't know,
but it'll fucking hurt.

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:31.114
And it'll fucking last.

01:02:31.115 --> 01:02:33.816
- So you're backing out.
- Did I say that?

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:37.220
It's the day before the job, and I'm having
some doubts and I'm fucking entitled to.

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:39.587
All right.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:45.261
So how about you then,
our fearless leader?

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.963
You're awfully quiet.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:49.165
You're saying it all
for me.

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.967
Yeah, I am.

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:53.269
You're supposed to be
the one rallying the troops.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:56.172
Oh, so Nicola's ultimatum
struck a chord.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:59.175
Fancy a couple of years in domestic bliss
instead of following up what you started?

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:01.110
- Fuck off, Demps.
- No, man.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.644
<i>You</i> fuck off!

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.015
I've handed in me notice
on me flat,

01:03:06.016 --> 01:03:09.285
I've sold the last of my CD's--
I've sold all me stuff!

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:12.522
I've put a lot of hours into this
job, and I want that coffee shop.

01:03:12.523 --> 01:03:15.124
I fucking deserve it.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.860
Now, I'm not gonna try and
talk anyone into anything,

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:21.896
'cause as far as I'm concerned
we've already made a deal.

01:03:24.233 --> 01:03:26.969
Now I'm going home.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.473
And anyone who hasn't
lost their bottle can follow.

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:34.609
I'll see you tonight,
or I'll see you around.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.937
Mum?

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.840
Mum.

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.312
I'm going now.

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:57.051
I would've told you sooner, but I
didn't know how you'd take it.

01:05:59.655 --> 01:06:02.692
Me and the lads have
set something up abroad.

01:06:02.693 --> 01:06:05.194
Our own business.

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:07.063
Working for nobody.

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:09.231
And when
we're up and running,

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:13.153
I'll have you over for a visit and you
can see what your son's made of himself.

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:16.804
It's gonna be something.

01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:24.145
You're gonna have to take care
of yourself for a while.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:28.349
I know you can do it.

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:50.404
I hope things--

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.545
I love you, Mum.

01:06:56.546 --> 01:06:59.079
Take care.

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:16.997
Nicola?

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:19.834
Nicola.

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:11.620
At the last minute,
when it becomes real,

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:14.223
you're gonna have doubts.

01:08:14.224 --> 01:08:18.727
It's the line between planning
and actually doing it,

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:22.196
between fantasy and reality.

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:24.533
It's a hell of a line
to cross.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:27.067
But you crossed it?

01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:32.171
They all kept their word.
I kept mine.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:38.444
That night we went over the
plan to the smallest detail.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.850
We had it locked.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:44.453
Everybody set to 10:23 in...

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:49.125
5, 4, 3, 2--

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.292
Now.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.330
I still think we should've used mobiles.
Mobiles could have a delay.

01:08:54.331 --> 01:08:56.732
Time is immovable.
Ain't that right, Harvey?

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:59.167
Come on, pal.
This is your mantra.

01:08:59.169 --> 01:09:01.904
What? Yeah. Just stick to the schedule.
We'll walk it.

01:09:01.904 --> 01:09:05.441
- Are you all right, Harvey?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:08.410
You sure? There ain't
nothin' you want to say?

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:10.379
Yeah, there is.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.916
Let's fucking smash it. Come on then!

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:17.685
Good night, girls. See ya.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:28.863
10:45. We move
to our first positions.

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.167
Ready to go
when the clock struck 11:00.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:34.603
We expected the first coaches
home in under 30 minutes.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:37.470
It all had to move
like clockwork.

01:09:46.948 --> 01:09:50.653
The alarm system has an exterior bus
network by the telephone exchange.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:52.720
This isn't the same
as an alarm control box...

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:55.257
which are housed inside the
building for obvious reasons,

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:57.493
so we couldn't shut it down.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:10:00.629
The best we could do was try and suspend the
individual exterior alarm sensors one at a time...

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.731
and delay the transmission
of the signal.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.535
One of us had to take care of it.
He had eight minutes.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:13.275
Another had to initiate
the actual break-in of the club.

01:10:13.276 --> 01:10:16.345
His job was to pave the way forward
for the third member of our team.

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:18.981
He had seven minutes
to do it.

01:10:18.982 --> 01:10:22.985
The third member had the unenviable
task of cracking the safe,

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:26.754
but his job wouldn't begin until
the others had completed theirs.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:33.427
And me? I had to make sure the job were
carried through to the very finish.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.732
Of course, you know what they
say about best-laid plans.

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:40.501
Charlie, I need
you to do something for me.

01:10:40.803 --> 01:10:42.771
What, now?

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:48.642
You can't account for issues like the
weather or nerves or human error.

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:52.014
If the tiniest element
misaligns,

01:10:52.015 --> 01:10:53.816
the rest will follow.

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:55.818
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:55.819 --> 01:10:58.721
Shit. Fucking--

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:01.455
And that's when we panic.

01:11:24.881 --> 01:11:26.982
Don't take the piss.

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:31.353
Get your stuff together so we don't have to
keep the driver hanging about all night.

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.843
Come on, for fuck's sake.

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:58.847
And panic
inevitably leads to mistakes.

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:17.598
That's when
confusion takes over.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.064
And before you
know what's happened,

01:12:49.065 --> 01:12:51.133
you're left standing alone,

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:54.569
and it all comes
crashing down around you.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.845
Fancy meeting you here.

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:08.715
I'm gonna
fucking enjoy this.

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:12.688
Not too late, am I?

01:13:12.689 --> 01:13:16.456
And all you've got left is
your instinct for self-preservation.

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:32.508
Come on, shift your arses, or you'll
all end up in the garage with the bus.

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:35.375
Look at this.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.896
Come on, everybody.
Off now.

01:14:16.051 --> 01:14:19.920
Call the fucking police.

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:24.793
When I heard the alarm,
I should've made a run for it.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.729
When Roper showed up 30 seconds
later, I should've run away,

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.597
but I just--

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:33.068
I couldn't.

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.938
Maybe there's a few things
I shouldn't have done.

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:38.106
That's quite a story,
Harvey.

01:14:38.107 --> 01:14:41.610
Quite a story.

01:14:41.611 --> 01:14:44.746
Now, I'm going to have to ask
you a few questions, Harvey,

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:46.515
straighten out
a couple of details.

01:14:46.516 --> 01:14:48.617
Understood?

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:51.220
You say
the alarm sounded...

01:14:51.221 --> 01:14:52.988
and 30 seconds later...

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:55.257
you were stood in front of
Roper outside the club?

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:57.159
Yeah, yeah,
that's about right.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.027
Right.

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.730
Now, when the alarm is triggered
in a place like the Rise Club,

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:04.766
it sends a message to the
security firm that covers it--

01:15:04.767 --> 01:15:07.069
in this case,
Steven Roper Securities.

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:11.206
The alarm was triggered
at approximately 11:15.

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:15.277
Emergency services received a call
from a local resident at 11:16,

01:15:15.278 --> 01:15:19.147
stating that the alarm at the club was
active and had been for about a minute.

01:15:19.148 --> 01:15:22.017
Our first officer arrived
at the scene at 11:19,

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:25.287
by which time the altercation between
yourself and Mr. Roper had taken place.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:27.222
Do you see
what I'm getting at?

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:29.725
No.
Right.

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:31.960
Now, if Steven Roper
was in his office...

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.096
on the other side
of the estate,

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:37.266
monitoring the security terminal that
indicated the break-in at the club,

01:15:37.267 --> 01:15:41.270
he would've had four minutes to
get across the estate, on foot,

01:15:41.271 --> 01:15:43.739
confront you,
slap you around a bit,

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:47.242
get knocked unconscious
and wait for the police.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:49.044
It's not really possible,
is it?

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.880
No.
No, I suppose it's not.

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:54.316
So how long had you been with
Roper before the police arrived?

01:15:54.317 --> 01:15:56.018
Uh, a few minutes.

01:15:56.019 --> 01:15:57.953
I mean--

01:15:57.954 --> 01:16:00.989
I-I turned up at the door
and it had already been busted.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.292
Roper showed up.
We had an altercation.

01:16:03.293 --> 01:16:05.127
He would've killed me.
All right.

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:07.062
He would've
fucking killed me.

01:16:07.063 --> 01:16:09.264
All right.
We'll get to that later.

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:13.001
But what I want to know is what Roper was doing
at the club before the alarm was triggered,

01:16:13.002 --> 01:16:15.637
when it was closed for business
and you were trying to rob it.

01:16:15.638 --> 01:16:17.806
- Mere coincidence?
- I don't know. Yeah. Maybe.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:20.142
- I don't believe in coincidence. -Maybe
he were trying to rob it himself.

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:22.878
Why would he do that if he owns
the firm that protects the place?

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:25.347
A-An insurance job?
I don't know.

01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:28.183
Maybe him and Albert
had the same idea as us--

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:30.652
- These three friends of yours-- give me their names.
- No, I can't do that.

01:16:30.653 --> 01:16:32.921
Why not? They can't be
very good friends...

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.257
if they were gonna leave you
there twisting in the wind.

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:38.060
They're not criminals. I shouldn't
have got them involved.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:40.696
You're probably right, given the
"coincidence" we were talking about.

01:16:40.697 --> 01:16:43.599
Now, I'd assume a smart lad
like you wouldn't have...

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.168
announced your intentions to rob
Steven Roper all over town,

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:49.004
so I also assume the only people
who knew about this were you,

01:16:49.005 --> 01:16:51.273
your three friends and
your estranged other half.

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:54.841
Now, you've got to be asking yourself, Harvey.
You've got to be!

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:57.279
Which one sold you out?

01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.148
- No one sold me out.
- You really believe it was coincidence?

01:17:00.149 --> 01:17:02.851
Yeah. It's easier
than believing it wasn't.

01:17:02.852 --> 01:17:04.987
Right. Well, let's stick
with that pretense.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:07.723
But if I can speak to them, they
might be able to get you out of...

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:10.058
at least some of the mess
that you're in.

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:12.194
I'm not giving you
their names.

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:15.097
You're gonna make life very difficult
for yourself if you don't, Harvey.

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:17.799
The Rise Club suffered
a break-in tonight.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.735
We're gonna have to charge you
with breaking and entering,

01:17:19.736 --> 01:17:21.803
theft, A.B.H.,
and possibly even worse.

01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:24.773
You've spent the entire night
incriminating yourself, Harvey.

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:27.109
Incriminating myself
as what?

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:29.011
Eh?

01:17:29.012 --> 01:17:32.648
I didn't steal anything.
Roper was at the club.

01:17:32.649 --> 01:17:36.852
Instead of taking his money and disappearing
into the night, I got the shit kicked out of me,

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:40.654
got dragged down here
and my mates ran away.

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:45.394
D.I. West,
can I have a quick word?

01:17:45.395 --> 01:17:49.398
For the benefit of the tape, Sergeant
Kendon has just entered the room.

01:17:49.399 --> 01:17:53.667
I am pausing the interview
at 0130 hours.

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.972
Excuse me.

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:15.190
So? What you got?

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:17.325
I took Albert Redford
round the club...

01:18:17.326 --> 01:18:21.163
in order to take a full account of
any damages or missing effects.

01:18:21.164 --> 01:18:23.231
Right.
So what's the verdict?

01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:26.368
Tills along the bar have been broken into
and emptied of a decent amount of cash,

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:28.937
but nothing else was taken.

01:18:28.938 --> 01:18:31.840
Not even a bottle of Grouse
from the shelves.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.276
What about the offices? Anything
taken from the offices?

01:18:34.277 --> 01:18:38.180
No. Albert was keen to take
a look, but nothing doing.

01:18:38.181 --> 01:18:41.047
Bolted shut
like a bomb shelter.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.251
A few quid
from the tills.

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:46.354
Not exactly Brinks-Mat,
is it?

01:18:48.925 --> 01:18:51.860
Right, well--

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:54.062
I guess
that's that then.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:56.630
Not quite.

01:18:57.065 --> 01:19:00.133
You haven't heard
the interesting part yet.

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:02.971
We found the money.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.388
Is there anything else
you'd like to tell me?

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:22.324
No.
I've told you everything.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:26.528
Now, you've noticed that
the tape is switched off?

01:19:26.529 --> 01:19:30.799
Off the record, just between the three
of us, anything else you'd like to say?

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.801
No.
I've told you everything.

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:34.770
Are you gonna
charge me, or--

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:37.906
- It appears it's your lucky night.
- My lucky night?

01:19:37.907 --> 01:19:41.276
The Rise Club was broken into
tonight, as you already know.

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:44.079
Money within
the region of £1,200...

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:47.382
was stolen from the tills in
the bar, which you don't know.

01:19:47.383 --> 01:19:52.320
Officers have recovered the money from
the premises of Steven Roper Securities.

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:54.189
What?

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:57.292
Steve Roper's fingerprints were
found on several of the notes,

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:00.095
and alongside the money
officers found something else--

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:04.099
a cellophane package containing
a powder, brown in color,

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.869
which our friends in the relevant
department tell me is heroin.

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:10.539
Five perfect fingerprints have been
recovered from that package...

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:13.807
also belonging to
Steven Roper.

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:18.980
We've also heard
from the hospital.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.949
He's still unconscious.

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:23.885
His face is a mess,
but he's stable.

01:20:23.886 --> 01:20:28.223
Now, charges will follow
for you, Harvey.

01:20:28.224 --> 01:20:30.959
A decent prosecutor will
have a lot of questions...

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.328
about the force
you used against Roper,

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:36.531
but for now I'm content
to state for the record...

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:40.700
that I believe self-defense is
what your actions constituted.

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:44.973
Now, being that the evidence is painting
the picture that we're currently seeing,

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:48.043
I also believe it would not suit
the interests of the C.P.S...

01:20:48.044 --> 01:20:50.445
to pursue any further
charges against you...

01:20:50.446 --> 01:20:53.279
concerning
the Rise Club break-in.

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.584
Where does that leave us?

01:20:55.585 --> 01:20:59.321
Well, that leaves us with
conspiracy to commit a crime.

01:20:59.322 --> 01:21:01.122
Conspiracy?
Wh--

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:03.992
Well, conspiracy's a funny thing.

01:21:03.993 --> 01:21:07.095
Some might call it jailing
people for thought crime.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:09.097
And you?

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:12.000
Prosecuting a young man for ballsing up
breaking into a working man's club...

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:14.102
would be an embarrassment
of the court's time.

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:16.238
So where does that
leave us?

01:21:16.239 --> 01:21:18.073
Well, for now
you're free to go.

01:21:18.074 --> 01:21:20.475
Right now?
Yes. Yes.

01:21:20.476 --> 01:21:24.911
Just gotta process a few forms
and you'll be on your way.

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:34.054
Is it two or four?
Or five? I-I forget.

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:37.092
Sunday league
quarter finals,

01:21:37.093 --> 01:21:39.227
there was a lad who
looked a lot like you...

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:42.195
put two away against Everton
in the second half.

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:45.166
We lost that game though.
Yeah.

01:21:45.167 --> 01:21:47.969
It was
a good effort though.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:51.471
It's a pity he was
let down by his team.

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:58.211
All right, thank you.
I'll follow you.

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:04.419
When Roper wakes up and we charge
him, his brief will push for bail.

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:06.922
They'll set it high,
but he will have the money.

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:08.123
Understand?

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:09.691
Yeah.

01:22:09.692 --> 01:22:12.358
Won't be long.

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:52.000
Right then, Mr. Miller.
You're free to go.

01:22:52.001 --> 01:22:56.369
P.C. Nixon will escort you to the
desk sergeant and get you signed out.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.674
It's been fun.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:02.475
It's been interesting.

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:18.420
<i>Steven Roper
sent me to prison,</i>

01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:21.589
destroyed my life
and tried to murder my friend,

01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:24.390
and he was gonna kill--

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:31.166
<i>I-I didn't lie. Well, maybe a
little, but only by omission.</i>

01:24:31.167 --> 01:24:33.633
I had my--

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:43.845
I had the shit kicked out of me, got
dragged down here and my mates ran away.

01:24:43.846 --> 01:24:46.181
<i>D.I. West,</i>
<i>can I have a quick word?</i>

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:49.684
For the benefit of the tape,
Sergeant Kendon has just entered the room.

01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:53.519
I am pausing the interview
at 0130 hours.

01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.912
<i>Hello, D.I. West.</i>

01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:24.419
I take it you saw the tape were recording
and decided to investigate a little.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:29.357
Now, you could go running down a
corridor, screaming for a blue light,

01:25:29.358 --> 01:25:32.527
bring me in so we can talk more
about charges and evidence.

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:36.831
But what's the point in doing that
when you can sit down, listen,

01:25:36.832 --> 01:25:38.900
and not have to
break a sweat?

01:25:38.901 --> 01:25:41.935
Go on. Sit down.

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:48.276
Comfortable?

01:25:48.277 --> 01:25:50.478
Good.

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:53.248
Now, I feel
I shortchanged you earlier.

01:25:53.249 --> 01:25:56.484
You sat and listened patiently to a
detailed account of the last few weeks...

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:59.754
and I built it up,
but I didn't deliver.

01:25:59.755 --> 01:26:03.924
I-I didn't lie. Well, maybe a
little, but only by omission.

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:06.928
I had my reasons.

01:26:06.929 --> 01:26:09.297
But now I'd like to
try that last bit again,

01:26:09.298 --> 01:26:12.498
and this time I'll be sure
not to leave anything out.

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:18.538
At 10:30 we left
the flat for our first positions--

01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:22.343
one of us in the steelyard
to the east of the club,

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:25.645
another behind the wall
to the west,

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:30.385
and me and the third
on the wasteland at the back.

01:26:30.386 --> 01:26:32.720
We each waited
for our time to move.

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:35.190
Night, Thompson. Good night, girls.
Good evenin'.

01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:37.523
Good night.

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:43.798
No one goes near the
front of the club until it is time.

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:46.267
It'll be lit and visible
by the flats and houses.

01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:49.304
Dodd, you'll be here,
on the east side.

01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:51.606
You make your way from the compound
to the east wall of the club.

01:26:51.607 --> 01:26:53.808
The exterior bus network box
and telephone exchange...

01:26:53.809 --> 01:26:55.810
is at the top of the building
with the phone lines.

01:26:55.811 --> 01:26:58.346
- You'll have eight minutes starting at--
- 11:00.

01:26:58.347 --> 01:27:01.314
It'll be tight,
but I'll do it.

01:27:13.428 --> 01:27:15.730
Charlie, I need you
to do something for me.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:18.498
What, now?

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:24.839
Fuck!

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.610
Dempsey, you'll be here on the southwest
wasteland. You leave at 11:08.

01:27:28.611 --> 01:27:31.346
You've got a lot to do.
We need it done by 11:15.

01:27:31.347 --> 01:27:33.613
Piece of piss.

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:15.855
For fuck's sake.

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:27.433
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Come on!

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:39.714
Okay. Okay.
That's enough.

01:28:39.715 --> 01:28:42.315
Go. Go.
Okay.

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:45.546
Dempsey, you need to be on your way
out of the lounge by 12 minutes past.

01:29:45.547 --> 01:29:48.149
Dodd, that's when
you cue Roper.

01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:53.520
4, 3, 2, 1--

01:29:57.925 --> 01:30:01.629
- That's the club.
- Want me to deal with it?

01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:04.832
No. Your man's coming round to buy weight any
time now and I don't wanna deal with him.

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:08.834
If I don't call in 10
minutes, you know the drill.

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:26.912
Hurry up, Charlie,
for fuck's sake.

01:31:34.922 --> 01:31:37.323
All right.

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:52.173
Dodd, you rip out the wires
at 11:14.

01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:55.676
Rip them from below the concrete so they can't
turn it off without shutting down the grid.

01:31:55.677 --> 01:32:00.581
Dempsey, you need to be on the ground and
finished with the door by then as well.

01:32:00.582 --> 01:32:02.783
- Then I want both of you gone.
- I don't like this bit, Harvey.

01:32:02.784 --> 01:32:05.253
Me neither. It's how it is,
or it all goes tits up.

01:32:05.254 --> 01:32:08.321
- Don't know, mate.
- It's how it is.

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:54.533
What the fuck!

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:48.789
They didn't
panic, they didn't make mistakes...

01:33:48.790 --> 01:33:50.925
and they certainly
didn't sell me out.

01:33:50.926 --> 01:33:53.027
They had done more than
could have been asked of them.

01:33:53.028 --> 01:33:56.796
The next part were mine.

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:01.502
Fancy meeting you here.

01:34:04.206 --> 01:34:07.840
I'm gonna
fucking enjoy this.

01:34:08.175 --> 01:34:10.344
Not too late, am I?

01:34:10.345 --> 01:34:13.914
No, Steve. You're right on time.

01:34:13.915 --> 01:34:16.417
I'm not gonna use this.

01:34:16.418 --> 01:34:20.820
Be like wearing a condom
to fuck a girl you really like.

01:34:24.692 --> 01:34:27.828
One step, and you'll
swallow this crowbar.

01:34:27.829 --> 01:34:29.997
As if you have the balls.

01:34:29.998 --> 01:34:32.667
Won't cost you
to find out.

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:35.836
Go on. Take a swing.
See if it works out.

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:39.173
What are you waiting for?
Come on! Have a go!

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:41.342
You got two choices,
Harvey.

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:45.012
You can either run away now, and maybe
you'll get far enough I'll never find you,

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:47.214
or you take a swing.

01:34:47.215 --> 01:34:50.251
But if you do, you'd better swing
hard, because if I get back up,

01:34:50.252 --> 01:34:55.022
my face, as I bury yours into the ground,
will be the last thing you ever see.

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:57.792
You're out of
your fucking league!

01:34:57.793 --> 01:34:59.794
I fucked you, Harvey.

01:34:59.795 --> 01:35:01.962
I fucked you,
and I fucked your little mate,

01:35:01.963 --> 01:35:04.031
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

01:35:04.032 --> 01:35:06.834
That's not exactly true,
now, is it?

01:35:06.835 --> 01:35:09.737
What are you gonna do?
Rip off the club?

01:35:09.738 --> 01:35:11.739
It's not mine.

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:15.209
Threaten me with a crowbar?
You think I'm scared, Harvey?

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:18.779
You think I'm gonna apologize?
Beg for your forgiveness?

01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:21.720
- I don't want your fucking apology.
- Well, what do you want?

01:35:23.018 --> 01:35:25.719
To watch you die.

01:35:27.289 --> 01:35:31.290
You've not got it,
to kill a man.

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:34.028
Have I not?
Go on then.

01:35:34.029 --> 01:35:36.864
Have you got the bollocks?
Have a go!

01:35:36.865 --> 01:35:39.433
I'm gonna take you
for everything you've got.

01:35:39.434 --> 01:35:43.270
I'm gonna put you down, and I'm
gonna smile while I do it.

01:35:43.271 --> 01:35:45.005
And I'm just gonna let you?

01:35:45.006 --> 01:35:47.241
It's already done.

01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:54.782
Oh, what a shame.
A busload of people.

01:35:54.783 --> 01:35:57.251
That takes the arse
out of your plans, didn't it?

01:35:57.252 --> 01:35:59.253
Not at all.

01:35:59.254 --> 01:36:02.757
You're standing in front of a business
with a busted door, holding a crowbar.

01:36:02.758 --> 01:36:06.494
You're fucked, Harvey. Don't fuck
yourself harder. Walk away now.

01:36:06.495 --> 01:36:08.362
How can I?

01:36:08.363 --> 01:36:10.898
I haven't put you down yet.
And you won't.

01:36:10.899 --> 01:36:12.933
You might be a prick,

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:16.137
but you're not
a stupid prick.

01:36:16.138 --> 01:36:21.408
On the other hand, I'm just a
hero acting in self-defense.

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:31.852
Call the fucking police.

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:49.970
Then the
police came, and I were arrested.

01:36:49.971 --> 01:36:51.572
Then I met you.

01:36:51.573 --> 01:36:54.275
Steven Roper sent me to
prison, destroyed my life...

01:36:54.276 --> 01:36:56.410
<i>and tried to</i>
<i>murder my friend,</i>

01:36:56.411 --> 01:36:58.279
<i>and he was</i>
<i>gonna kill me.</i>

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.813
<i>I hope you believe</i>
<i>I were justified.</i>

01:37:02.249 --> 01:37:05.886
<i>Now, I'm sure you're
wondering about the money.</i>

01:37:05.887 --> 01:37:08.455
<i>After all,</i>
<i>wasn't that the point?</i>

01:37:08.456 --> 01:37:11.125
<i>As you said earlier, it's a
shame it hadn't worked out,</i>

01:37:11.126 --> 01:37:12.860
<i>and you were right.</i>

01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:14.895
<i>It hadn't worked out.</i>
<i>Not yet anyway.</i>

01:37:14.896 --> 01:37:17.198
<i>So here's the fun part.</i>

01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:20.134
<i>How do you get into the room of a
building to break into a locked safe...</i>

01:37:20.135 --> 01:37:23.170
when the building is teeming with
police, the room is in the basement,

01:37:23.171 --> 01:37:27.074
<i>the basement has no windows and
the door is as secure as a vault?</i>

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:41.555
Like
every good schoolboy knows,

01:37:41.556 --> 01:37:44.425
you have to
do your homework.

01:37:44.426 --> 01:37:48.295
Charlie, you need to get back to your first
position as quickly as possible and wait.

01:37:48.296 --> 01:37:54.468
You can give me a crash course in
steelwork if you've got the time.

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:04.912
Can someone shut
that fucking alarm off!

01:38:04.913 --> 01:38:08.515
Cabling's knackered. Gonna have to shut
power down at grid. Just get it done!

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:23.163
Everything in order?

01:38:23.164 --> 01:38:25.165
Yeah, looks to be fine.

01:38:25.166 --> 01:38:27.902
As you know,
Detective, everything has a weakness.

01:38:27.903 --> 01:38:30.004
You just have to find it.

01:38:30.005 --> 01:38:33.607
So you're saying there's no chance then?
Not a sniff.

01:38:33.608 --> 01:38:37.311
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to take a piss.

01:38:37.312 --> 01:38:39.346
Only went
five minutes ago.

01:38:39.347 --> 01:38:42.715
Must be the sound
of running water.

01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:46.987
Shame you wasted your
time though, Harvey. No.

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:38.272
For Christ's sake.

01:39:38.273 --> 01:39:41.041
I had them cut the power.

01:39:41.042 --> 01:39:43.043
Come on.
Let's get back up.

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.762
It's funny to think
that while I were chatting to you...

01:40:34.763 --> 01:40:41.035
<i>the safe in the Rise Club were being
emptied of all his ill-earned money.</i>

01:40:41.036 --> 01:40:43.670
There's a couple of reasons
why I'm telling you this.

01:40:43.671 --> 01:40:46.407
Being a smart arse
is just one of them.

01:40:46.408 --> 01:40:49.343
Another is that you seem genuinely
concerned for my well-being,

01:40:49.344 --> 01:40:52.279
so I thought I'd put
your mind at ease, but...

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.784
mainly it's because I need you
to restore my faith in humanity.

01:40:56.785 --> 01:40:59.219
<i>You have a choice,</i>
<i>D.I. West.</i>

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.588
You could pretend
you never heard this tape...

01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:05.559
<i>and let a man you know deserves
it go down and let us walk away,</i>

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.896
or you could alert the police at
the port and have us brought in.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.068
I suppose I won't know
till we get there.

01:41:19.473 --> 01:41:21.408
Hey up!

01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:24.745
Fucking hell! Are you all right?

01:41:24.746 --> 01:41:27.748
All right? Oh, fucking hell!
You took your time!

01:41:27.749 --> 01:41:29.750
I thought you'd been
taken to the big house!

01:41:29.751 --> 01:41:32.219
Fucking drive, before
they change their mind.

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.822
- Everyone all right?
- Better than all right, mate!

01:41:34.823 --> 01:41:37.357
We've only gone and done it!

01:41:37.358 --> 01:41:39.226
It's soaking wet.

01:41:39.227 --> 01:41:42.096
You would be if I dragged you 20
foot through a flooded storm drain.

01:41:42.097 --> 01:41:45.099
- How much is there?
- £75,000!

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.167
Bang!
Whoo!

01:41:47.168 --> 01:41:51.238
That's the coffee shop and
four grand each pocket money.

01:41:51.239 --> 01:41:53.841
- It's all down to you, mate.
- Bollocks. It were all of us.

01:41:53.842 --> 01:41:56.810
Well, that's
true, but all the same--

01:41:56.811 --> 01:41:58.812
Your math is on its arse,
by the way.

01:41:58.813 --> 01:42:01.515
20 grand four ways
is five grand each.

01:42:01.516 --> 01:42:04.418
- I think Nicola deserves her cut, pal.
- What are you on about?

01:42:04.419 --> 01:42:07.488
Think you just talked your way out
of police custody, no extra boost?

01:42:07.489 --> 01:42:11.625
Was the money and heroin found in Roper's
office the only thing tying him to the robbery?

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:13.594
There was fingerprints
on them.

01:42:13.595 --> 01:42:16.161
And how did
they get there?

01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:18.866
- Steven.
- Hey, what?

01:42:18.867 --> 01:42:22.534
Can I have a word?
In private.

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:30.444
What's that? I'm paying you
to leave Harvey alone.

01:42:30.445 --> 01:42:34.246
There's a grand there. I'm giving
it to you for Harvey's protection.

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:36.550
Don't want your money.

01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:39.153
Could work out another
line of credit though.

01:42:39.154 --> 01:42:41.355
Please, Roper.
Just take that money.

01:42:41.356 --> 01:42:45.192
You know, if I were you, I wouldn't give
a bucket of piss for Harvey's future.

01:42:45.193 --> 01:42:46.827
I'll drive you home.

01:42:46.828 --> 01:42:49.763
That's a lot of money, and it's a
rough area, and I'm a gentleman.

01:42:49.764 --> 01:42:52.799
I took the notes with
Roper's prints on them,

01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:55.802
stamped them at club's tills while I were
in there and added them to the rest.

01:42:55.803 --> 01:42:58.672
I used the print-covered cellophane to
re-wrap the gear we stole from Roper...

01:42:58.673 --> 01:43:00.941
before we planted it
in his office.

01:43:00.942 --> 01:43:03.410
Clever, eh? You're not the
only one with bright ideas.

01:43:03.411 --> 01:43:06.446
You let Nicola go to see him?
Hold your horses!

01:43:06.447 --> 01:43:09.316
- When I said other people have bright ideas, I meant her.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:43:09.317 --> 01:43:11.652
She wanted to keep you safe
and out of jail,

01:43:11.653 --> 01:43:14.521
but she didn't want you to think that she'd
changed her mind about seeing you again.

01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:18.392
So why are we portioning her some of the money then?
Because she's full of shit.

01:43:18.393 --> 01:43:21.628
I spoke to her for five minutes when
we went to pick up a pizza last night.

01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:24.665
Apart from prints, two things
came out of the conversation.

01:43:24.666 --> 01:43:28.735
One: She thinks you saw her get out of
Roper's car two nights ago. Did you?

01:43:28.736 --> 01:43:31.672
Yeah. I knew you'd have
called it off if I told you.

01:43:31.673 --> 01:43:34.474
I didn't know what she were doing, but I
knew she wouldn't stab us in the back.

01:43:34.475 --> 01:43:36.710
It's good you trust her,

01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:40.547
because the other thing that came out of the
conversation is, she's still got it bad for you.

01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:44.551
- What did she say? -With a bird,
pal, it's not so much what they say.

01:43:44.552 --> 01:43:47.521
- It's how they say it.
- All right, how did she say it?

01:43:47.522 --> 01:43:52.391
Do you want me to do you a fucking impression?
Just phone her, you ponce!

01:43:57.699 --> 01:44:00.334
Thought you
said you wouldn't answer.

01:44:00.335 --> 01:44:02.836
Well, I suppose
I'm a good liar.

01:44:02.837 --> 01:44:06.339
You should watch out
for that.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:10.937
For a while there, I thought we were never
gonna see that shit-eating grin again.

01:45:10.938 --> 01:45:13.040
What can I tell you?

01:45:13.041 --> 01:45:16.441
Looks like it's gonna be
a beautiful day.

01:48:55.929 --> 01:49:00.532
