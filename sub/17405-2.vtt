00:11.320 --> 00:13.960
'Tonight, I move my eyes...

00:15.400 --> 00:17.190
'.. Richard vandalises a road...'

00:17.240 --> 00:18.310
There you go.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.030
'.. and James says, "Cow." '

00:20.080 --> 00:21.280
Cow!

00:28.120 --> 00:29.390
Hello.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.430
Hello, good evening, and
welcome. Thank you so much.

00:34.480 --> 00:38.710
Now, this is a mobile telephone.

00:38.760 --> 00:39.910
It's fully functional

00:39.960 --> 00:41.590
and what I'm going to do...

00:41.640 --> 00:44.110
is throw it in that lavatory.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.710
I know that's the first time
you've ever seen a programme

00:46.760 --> 00:49.070
start that way, but bear with me,

00:49.120 --> 00:51.190
because if we now look...

00:51.240 --> 00:54.550
Yeah, it's only been in the
water for a few seconds,

00:54.600 --> 00:56.230
but it's ruined for ever.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.270
If you wanted to communicate
with somebody,

00:58.320 --> 01:01.320
you'd be better off using
a Brussels sprout.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.910
Of course, because if you expose
your phone to any form of moisture

01:04.959 --> 01:08.990
or heat or dust or
vibration, it will break.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.830
It's not just phones,
it's everything -

01:10.880 --> 01:12.790
printers, laptops, Wi-Fi routers.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.430
My coffee machine breaks even
when you expose it to coffee.

01:17.560 --> 01:21.630
Anything with a circuit board is
as reliable as a Greek accountant.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.310
It is. Except, weirdly, except cars.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.710
Now, we were talking about this
in the office the other day,

01:29.760 --> 01:31.950
and there was a bit of an argument.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.790
We were saying you can drive a
car across the Sahara, the Arctic,

01:35.840 --> 01:39.190
you can run it through hurricanes
and dust storms and it'll be fine.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.190
Hmm, but the producers are saying

01:41.240 --> 01:44.990
that because modern cars are
so complex and so electronical,

01:45.040 --> 01:47.750
they are bound to suffer
from reliability problems

01:47.800 --> 01:49.070
like everything else.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.350
Right, so to see who is correct,

01:51.400 --> 01:52.790
the producers said to us,

01:52.840 --> 01:56.190
"Go out and each choose your
favourite modern GT car,

01:56.240 --> 01:59.510
"and then report with
them to what's billed

01:59.560 --> 02:03.750
"as the most hirsute and manly
proving ground of them all -

02:03.800 --> 02:05.750
"Austria."

02:05.800 --> 02:07.740
No, James, Australia.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.710
Same thing.

02:18.920 --> 02:23.040
'This is the hirsute and manly
proving ground in question...

02:25.120 --> 02:30.190
'.. the vast, almost completely
uninhabited Northern Territory,

02:30.240 --> 02:33.480

'Richard had chosen to take on this
brutal and enormous wilderness

02:46.160 --> 02:50.310
'in a car that was designed for
the car park at Old Trafford -

02:50.360 --> 02:52.500
'a Bentley Continental GT.

'the BMW M6 Gran Coupe.'

03:21.880 --> 03:23.030
I tell you what.

03:23.080 --> 03:25.590
~ What?
~ I think this is the first time

03:25.640 --> 03:27.150
in all of Top Gear's history,

03:27.200 --> 03:30.750
where all three of us like
all three of the cars.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.750
Normally, I go, "Yours is rubbish,
and you've made the wrong decision,

03:33.800 --> 03:35.710
"and I'm the only one
who's done it properly."

03:35.760 --> 03:37.830
It's a good point, actually,
cos I do like your car

03:37.880 --> 03:40.510
and I do like your car, Hammond,
and I like my car, obviously.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.270
It's a GT-R. You can't
not like a GT-R.

03:42.320 --> 03:45.590
If you like driving above all else

03:45.640 --> 03:48.350
and to the exclusion of
all other considerations,

03:48.400 --> 03:50.740
you have to have one of these.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.430
If you have a Ferrari
or a Lamborghini,

03:54.480 --> 03:57.030
what you're saying is, "I'm not
that interested in driving."

03:57.080 --> 03:58.910
~ It's showing off.
~ It's showing off.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.550
Speaking of which, the
Bentley Continental...

04:01.600 --> 04:03.740
Now, what happened there?

04:04.440 --> 04:07.910
We used to think it was a bit
dull, but now it's sort of good.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.430
~ But it was overnight.
~ It was.
~ We all must have woken up...

04:10.480 --> 04:13.190
I hate the Bentley Continental.
I hate the Bentley Continental.

04:13.240 --> 04:16.149
I hate the Bentley Continental. God,
I love the Bentley Continental.

04:16.200 --> 04:19.510
I don't understand that. Cos they
haven't changed the styling much.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.750
It's been around a while now.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.830
But then you just woke
up one morning and went,

04:22.880 --> 04:24.070
"That looks really good."

04:24.120 --> 04:26.750
I'd actually have a yellow one
as well. It looks tremendous.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.800
But while we're on the subject
of styling... a-hem, a-hem, a-hem!

04:32.320 --> 04:34.830
Oh, how we mocked when they said
they were going to do this.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.870
Right, so you are going
to do a four-door version

04:36.920 --> 04:39.110
of a two-door version of
a four-door saloon car?

04:39.160 --> 04:41.990
And then it came out and you just
thought, "That is so good looking."

04:42.040 --> 04:46.070
I love that back wheel. That dished
back wheel looks so fantastic.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.590
Almost a double-bubble roof.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.710
I know it's carbon fibre,
which is a little bit...

04:49.760 --> 04:52.670
~ We can gloss over that.
~ But, God, it looks good.

04:52.720 --> 04:57.790
'As we continued our three-car
love-in, a challenge arrived.'

04:57.840 --> 04:59.430
Here we go.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.390
"You will drive to a farm,
which is four days from here."

05:03.440 --> 05:06.750
Everything is four days from
everything in Australia!

05:06.800 --> 05:11.510
"And when you arrive you will use
your cars to round up 4,000 cows."

05:11.560 --> 05:13.950
~ But...
~ Can you do that?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.030
"The farm is a big one.
Three million...."

05:16.080 --> 05:18.790
~ Three million acres?!
~ No, it's not.
~ You read that wrong.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.510
~ It's in words.
~ It's in words, yeah.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.030
~ Three...
~ It's not...? Are you sure...?
~ It isn't 300,000?

05:23.080 --> 05:25.070
~ Three million in the country?
~ That's a big farm.

05:25.120 --> 05:30.190
~ Never mind that. Rounding
up 4,000 cows using...
~ These.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.510
Oh, God, James, what have you done?

05:34.560 --> 05:36.350
What's he done, what?

05:36.400 --> 05:40.190
As we know, there is a strong
republican movement in this country,

05:40.240 --> 05:42.750
people who think it's ridiculous
to have a head of state

05:42.800 --> 05:44.950
living in London on the
other side of the world.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.710
He turns up here with that
on the number plate.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.790
What?

05:49.840 --> 05:52.070
Can you not see that? It's obvious.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.350
~ No.
~ "Charles and Camilla."

05:55.400 --> 05:57.390
You've done it on purpose,
haven't you, James?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.030
~ Let me explain.
~ You blithering idiot.
~ You idiot!

06:00.080 --> 06:03.550
Oh, no! Mine says, "Big Royalist."

06:03.600 --> 06:05.510
~ It does.
~ It totally does. You can see it.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.630
"Big Royalist."

06:06.680 --> 06:09.190
Luckily, mine just says BMW 001,

06:09.240 --> 06:12.030
cos I've covered myself
on this occasion.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.950
No, you idiot. "Bloody Mrs Windsor."

06:15.000 --> 06:16.910
Oh, no! "Bloody Mrs Windsor."

06:16.960 --> 06:19.350
~ We're in trouble now!
~ How could he possibly know?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.550
I rang them up and said,
"Can you provide a car?

06:21.600 --> 06:24.110
"Can you make sure the number
plate doesn't say 'convict'

06:24.160 --> 06:25.310
"or anything on it?"

06:25.360 --> 06:26.990
And they've done that!

06:27.040 --> 06:30.360
We're going to have to drive through...
We'll be stoned by republicans.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.190
'As we set off, though, we
had a more immediate problem.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.310
'Could our complicated
cars really cope

06:40.360 --> 06:43.520
'with this vast,
superheated dust bowl?'

06:48.120 --> 06:51.630
Vauxhall once thought they'd try
and sell the Senator in Australia,

06:51.680 --> 06:54.150
a big old saloon made
in Germany in the '80s.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.830
So they shipped one out here
and it lasted a couple of days

06:57.880 --> 07:00.430
and then it split in half.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.990
Split in half!

07:02.040 --> 07:04.640
That's how brutal the outback is.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.590
This car has electronic
valve control,

07:09.640 --> 07:13.430
electronic gearbox control,
an electronic differential.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.670
Everything is electronic.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.710
It actually has a sensor
in the engine that adjusts

07:18.760 --> 07:22.270
all the settings, so that no matter
how hot it is or how cold it is,

07:22.320 --> 07:25.870
you always get 575 horsepower.

07:25.920 --> 07:30.390
And I'm expecting it to work
here in this dust and this heat

07:30.440 --> 07:31.870
and with these vibrations...

07:31.920 --> 07:33.790
and then go farming.

07:37.480 --> 07:40.310
My Nissan is an absolute nerd-fest.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.030
I'm going to give you a few examples.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.990
It's built in a hermetically
sealed factory,

07:45.040 --> 07:47.710
so that no dust can get into
the engine or the gearbox.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.990
The tyres are filled with nitrogen,

07:50.040 --> 07:53.430
because it's more stable
than atmospheric air.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.310
The engine is canted slightly
forwards under the bonnet,

07:56.360 --> 07:58.710
so that when it tenses
up under acceleration,

07:58.760 --> 08:01.860
it all forms a nice,
straight, efficient line.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.950
I mean, it's been built by the cream
of Japanese automotive engineers

08:08.000 --> 08:09.310
at Nissan.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.270
That's a pretty good guarantee.

08:11.320 --> 08:15.640
But I bet even they, watching this,
would think, "Are we sure?"

08:22.520 --> 08:28.270
This has 30 ECUs in it. That's
30 laptops buzzing away all over.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.750
It's got two miles of wiring in it,

08:30.800 --> 08:33.150
a lot of which is super-fast,
super-sophisticated

08:33.200 --> 08:35.350
super-delicate fibre optics.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.150
I mean, this dust is
going to get everywhere.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.880
And delicate, modern, sophisticated
electronics do not like dust.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.910
'As Hammond was rabbiting
on about dust,

08:49.960 --> 08:52.350
'I decided to have
a debate with James

08:52.400 --> 08:55.340
'about which of our
cars was the fastest.'

08:56.680 --> 09:00.440
You know the Datsun you're driving
is unbelievably fast, yes?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.070
Yes.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.270
Off the line, this will
leave it for dead.

09:07.320 --> 09:10.430
The M6 will cream you.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.680
No, not off the line it won't.
You know that's nonsense.

09:18.520 --> 09:21.790
'To prove him wrong, I decided
to have a drag race

09:21.840 --> 09:24.630
'on one of the many World
War II airfields that litter

09:24.680 --> 09:27.830
'this part of northern Australia.'

09:27.880 --> 09:31.150
It is absolutely
blistering, this thing.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.230
0-60, 2.8 seconds.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.480
2.8!

09:36.880 --> 09:39.830
Hammond, would you like to come and
amuse us with your stately home

09:39.880 --> 09:41.310
in a drag race?

09:41.360 --> 09:44.030
Yes, all right, if I must.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.440
He's probably got a demented relation
living in a tower in there somewhere.

09:54.320 --> 09:57.550
'It didn't take long
to find an airfield.

09:57.600 --> 10:01.960
'And we lined up on the runway
with me resigned to my fate.'

10:04.200 --> 10:07.270
I have a four-litre twin-turbo V8

10:07.320 --> 10:09.910
making 521 bhp.

10:09.960 --> 10:13.470
But I think... I may struggle here.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.350
They've got launch control, more
power and they're lighter.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.510
It's come up here what I have to
do to engage the launch control.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.710
So, "deactivate dynamic
stability control.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.390
"Select sequential mode with
drive programme three."

10:28.440 --> 10:30.590
That sharpens up the gear changes.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.590
"With the engine running, depress
the brake with the left foot."

10:33.640 --> 10:34.750
Done that.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.430
"Push the selector lever
forwards and hold.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.560
"A flag symbol appears in
the instrument cluster."

10:43.040 --> 10:45.270
It doesn't.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.460
I'll start again. Into...

10:48.280 --> 10:50.230
It will be a fairly simple process,

10:50.280 --> 10:55.270
but it will be beyond the
mind of the average ape.

10:55.320 --> 10:58.510
Maybe the air conditioning
has to be off.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.790
Let's try that. No.

11:00.840 --> 11:04.270
'Things were much simpler
in the Nissan.'

11:04.320 --> 11:06.550
Right. On, on, on.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.590
Red, red, red.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.190
Manual mode first. Left
foot on the brake.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.630
This is a tiresome formality.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.790
I'm sorry to waste
your time, viewers.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.030
Nothing in the world moves
off the line more quickly

11:17.080 --> 11:19.390
than a Nissan GT-R. That's
just one of those facts.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.150
It's probably in the Bible somewhere.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.870
Right, not a lot to do in the
Bentley before we do this.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.710
Lower the ride height. Done.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.270
Firm up the suspension.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.350
Let's have that on "sport".

11:31.400 --> 11:32.750
And that's it. I'm ready to go.

11:32.800 --> 11:37.710
'And, after about half
an hour, so was Jeremy.'

11:37.760 --> 11:39.350
OK, we're good to go,
we're good to go.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.960
Three, two, one.

11:48.760 --> 11:51.590
Oh, it's gone, it's gone,
it's gone, it's gone.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.840
BMW scrabbling about for
traction all over the shop.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.280
Should prove the point.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.080
Wow!

12:04.760 --> 12:07.640
This launch control doesn't work.

12:09.800 --> 12:14.070
It does about five feet and it
goes, "Oh, I can't be bothered."

12:14.120 --> 12:17.150
'As it seems, had James.'

12:17.200 --> 12:18.710
Why did you stop?

12:18.760 --> 12:20.670
I won.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.110
What do you mean, you won?
The flags are down there.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.150
~ No, you said which is
the quickest off the mark.
~ Mine was.

12:26.200 --> 12:29.470
~ No, you weren't.
~ It was.
~ It wasn't.
~ It went like a scalded rabbit.

12:29.520 --> 12:31.870
~ I know, but I was off the mark quicker.
~ You weren't.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.830
Nothing is quicker off
the mark than this car.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.670
~ Do you want to check the camera?
~ Yes.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.390
~ Well, I'll check the camera.
~ All right, we'll check the camera.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.110
'We went to check the camera.'

12:41.160 --> 12:42.870
You watch this, OK?

12:42.920 --> 12:45.790
~ Right, and go.
~ Go.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.670
~ God, we haven't got very
good reactions, have we?
~ Not very good.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.470
~ My God, we are useless.
~ That can't...

12:51.520 --> 12:54.390
~ That's...
~ Yes, thank you, thank you.
~ Yeah, you were first.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.630
What?

12:55.680 --> 12:58.310
Oh, God, look at the
BMW. Why am I last?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.630
Right, we've established...

12:59.680 --> 13:02.910
I think the Nissan just
wins it over 16 metres,

13:02.960 --> 13:05.030
followed by the Bentley.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.830
~ The BMW, a rather poor third.
~ Yes.

13:07.880 --> 13:11.830
'I therefore decided we should
have another drag race,

13:11.880 --> 13:16.000
'in which James would go all
the way and I'd go old school.'

13:17.320 --> 13:19.310
I'm doing manual gear changes.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.590
Manual start. No traction control.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.510
Me and the machine.

13:25.560 --> 13:28.270
This is a serious test,
actually, of these cars,

13:28.320 --> 13:30.660
drag racing them in this heat.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.550
107 degrees Fahrenheit.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.340
Three, two, one.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.660
Come on, Bentley, come on, come on!

13:44.840 --> 13:47.510
I am hard on the heels of the Nissan.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.420
Oh, my God, I'm overtaking it!

13:54.320 --> 13:56.060
Come on, Beemer.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.630
I've got the Datsun!

14:03.880 --> 14:07.200
That Bentley is unbelievably fast.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.200
But I going to get him.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.760
This is the closest I've ever seen!

14:18.320 --> 14:21.750
Come on, Beemer, you can't
lose to that monster!

14:21.800 --> 14:24.550
No way. No way!

14:27.040 --> 14:29.310
Yes!

14:29.360 --> 14:33.320
What a machine you are, BMW!

14:37.000 --> 14:40.710
'Having established that the most
powerful car is the fastest,

14:40.760 --> 14:42.900
'we got back on the road.'

14:44.520 --> 14:48.320
Cooling down now in the evening.
It's down to 98 degrees Fahrenheit.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.030
'The producers said we'd
be staying that night

14:52.080 --> 14:54.030
'at the Million Stars Motel,

14:54.080 --> 14:58.150
'which boasted "the finest fish
restaurant in the outback".

14:58.200 --> 15:00.550
'And we were looking forward to that.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.800
However, when they told
us we'd arrived...

15:06.960 --> 15:08.800
Where is it?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.670
I know exactly what
this is. I've got it.

15:12.720 --> 15:13.670
What?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.870
Million Star Motel.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.790
Best fish restaurant in the outback.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.310
It's a joke.

15:19.360 --> 15:20.390
Yes.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.550
~ It's a funny joke.
~ Funny!

15:22.600 --> 15:24.470
Funny, yeah - good!

15:25.720 --> 15:27.520
So, we're tenting.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.350
'We were given some
horrible camping stuff

15:31.400 --> 15:34.070
'and an Australian kitchen.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.280
'And once that had been set up,
we had to catch our supper.'

15:38.830 --> 15:39.830
No, thanks.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.750
Welcome to Top Gear.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.480
~ Oh,
~ BLEEP
~ hell!

15:49.920 --> 15:53.110
~ What are you struggling with?
~ Everything.
~ Oh, watch it!

15:53.160 --> 15:55.470
Can you look behind
you, when you do that?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.790
Yes! Why are you in your car?

15:58.720 --> 16:02.950
I am in the car because the
crocodiles are in THAT pond.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.230
Oh, there's no crocodiles here.

16:05.280 --> 16:08.070
Well, there are! They
can sit under water.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.990
These are machines for
killing and eating!

16:11.040 --> 16:13.990
They can tackle a water
buffalo, whole.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.670
Are you not scared of crocodiles?

16:15.720 --> 16:17.230
I'm not when they're not there.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.390
Then there's the snakes.
There's the death adders.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.310
There is no country on earth where
the public perception of the country

16:24.360 --> 16:27.150
is further removed from the
reality than Australia.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.430
It's just tourists.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.910
Hold on, what was
that? What did that?

16:31.960 --> 16:33.070
It's gone under the water.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.420
~ Where is he gone?
~ I don't know but he's gone down.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.470
~ Argh, look at that!
~ It is!

16:39.520 --> 16:44.070
~ Yes, it is!
~ That is moving towards us, isn't it?
~ Yes.

16:44.120 --> 16:47.110
Did you read about that one last
week that ate a Bentley whole,

16:47.160 --> 16:49.670
~ complete with the man in it?
~ Yes, but it spat the Bentley out.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.800
~ It carries a spare set of teeth.
~ Does it?
~ Yes.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.870
Thank you very much. Thank you.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.670
Now, because we're in
Australia this week,

17:01.720 --> 17:05.950
and because Australia is enormously
full of a million things to do,

17:06.000 --> 17:09.710
we have no time to do
the news, I'm afraid.

17:09.760 --> 17:13.190
Nor do we have time for The
Stig to go round the track.

17:13.240 --> 17:18.349
But we have made time to put a
Star in our Reasonably Priced Car.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.030
And that's because my guest tonight

17:21.079 --> 17:24.670
is THE best British actor
ever to come out of Canada.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.230
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:27.280 --> 17:30.480
please welcome, from America,
Kiefer Sutherland!

17:33.360 --> 17:36.350
Well done. How are you, mate?

17:36.400 --> 17:39.390
~ Great to see you. How are you?
~ Great!
~ Look who's here!

17:39.440 --> 17:42.150
Jack Bauer!

17:42.200 --> 17:45.030
Thank you very much. How are you?

17:45.080 --> 17:46.710
~ I'm very well. How are you?
~ Good.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.510
A lot of people would be surprised
to find that you were

17:49.560 --> 17:52.070
~ actually born in London, weren't you?
~ Yeah.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.630
I was born in Paddington. In fact,
there was a very funny moment.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.670
I was doing a documentary
with a friend.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.510
He was following with
a camera, and I said,

17:59.560 --> 18:01.270
"St Mary's hospital
is right down here.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.110
"That's where I was born." And
as I was showing it to him,

18:04.160 --> 18:06.750
a wrecking ball came out of nowhere
and just knocked it down

18:06.800 --> 18:09.870
and, apparently, they were
moving it across the street.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.990
I got the last vision of the
hospital that I was born in.

18:13.040 --> 18:15.350
The place of your birth,
they'd knocked it down.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.190
Yeah, I know. They
did that with mine.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.670
While I was being born!

18:18.720 --> 18:20.710
~ Of course, your father, he's Donald.
~ Yes.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.070
I want to get on to this.
It's slightly delicate.

18:23.120 --> 18:26.270
But nobody likes to think
of their parents having sex.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.990
This is not something
we can even visualise.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.750
But your father, of course, was in
Don't Look Now, with Julie Christie.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.870
~ Yes.
~ Is that a struggle for you to watch?

18:37.120 --> 18:39.350
It was a real struggle
at about 13, 14,

18:39.400 --> 18:42.910
because Julie Christie was stunning,
and you're 14 years old

18:42.960 --> 18:46.070
and you're watching it, trying
to block your father out.

18:46.120 --> 18:48.310
And then, "No, this
isn't going to work.

18:48.360 --> 18:52.470
"This isn't going to work." But,
yes, that moment was kind of tricky.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.270
Um, now, obviously, you're
best known for 24,

18:56.320 --> 19:00.070
and I know a lot of people here
will want me to talk about 24.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.990
I think I'm right in saying,
was it the first of the what

19:03.040 --> 19:06.750
~ we now take as the binge-viewing box set?
~ Yes.
~ It sort of was.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.390
And there had never been before...
You were a big-name actor

19:10.440 --> 19:13.150
who took up a TV role
which, now, is the norm.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.390
You've got Kevin Spacey going
in House Of Cards and so on,

19:16.440 --> 19:20.590
but, back then, you were either a
TV actor or you were a movie actor.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.830
So it was a ground-breaking thing.

19:22.880 --> 19:27.350
For me, it was a no-brainer. I noticed
the film world was changing.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.750
We used to have five studios
that made 50-odd movies a year.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.550
It went down to three studios
only making 15 movies a year.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.670
And all of a sudden,
the movies that I liked,

19:35.720 --> 19:38.070
like Ordinary People
or Terms Of Endearment,

19:38.120 --> 19:41.350
that kind of 20 million movie,
wasn't getting made any more.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.550
It was all superheroes.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.030
And all of the great drama was kind
of shifting over to television.

19:46.080 --> 19:48.670
And with regard to
the binge-watching,

19:48.720 --> 19:51.910
I ran into a gentleman at
an airport, and he said,

19:51.960 --> 19:55.350
"You ruined my honeymoon." I said,
"How?" He said, "Well, my wife..."

19:55.400 --> 19:58.070
I said, "I don't even
know your wife."

19:58.120 --> 20:01.390
And he said... "No, no,
no, not that. Not that.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.710
"We watched the first 12
hours of 24 on the plane

20:03.760 --> 20:05.230
"from Los Angeles to Paris.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.430
"And the first day of our honeymoon,

20:07.480 --> 20:09.710
"we spent the next
12 hours in the hotel

20:09.760 --> 20:13.230
"watching the next 12 hours."
And I was flattered by that.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.750
You know, ruining...

20:14.800 --> 20:17.670
24 actually ruined my children's
lives because they were young

20:17.720 --> 20:20.670
when it first started, and
nine o'clock was their bedtime

20:20.720 --> 20:22.710
but they had to go immediately
at nine o'clock.

20:22.760 --> 20:26.110
And even now, when they hear the
word "Previously..." they go to bed.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.230
That's quite a great tool.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.990
But it was very important in
my life. Very, very important.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.190
Thank you very much.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.910
I'm sure a lot of people here
would agree with me on that.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.990
~ Didn't you do Rodeo riding?
~ I did, yeah.

20:40.040 --> 20:43.710
~ Actually professionally?
~ I roped in the US TRC circuit.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.990
And I was fortunate enough, I
think I won about three or four.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.190
So why don't you do more
movies that call for you

20:49.240 --> 20:51.750
~ to ride around on horses?
~ They don't make a lot of them.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.830
I'm one of the few actors
I know that's actually

20:53.880 --> 20:57.030
gotten to do a western. Earlier
in my career I got to do films

20:57.080 --> 20:58.950
like Young Guns and Young Guns II.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.790
Can Charlie Sheen ride a horse?
He must be able to ride a horse.

21:02.840 --> 21:05.590
Charlie Sheen didn't like horses
and horses didn't like him.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.750
And that was firmly established
when we were shooting Young Guns.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.190
And most of the scenes involving
Charlie on a horse,

21:11.240 --> 21:15.430
he was on a ladder with a saddle and
some poor teamster holding the bit.

21:15.480 --> 21:18.670
He would hold the reins and he would
kind of act his way out of that.

21:18.720 --> 21:21.670
When we went to go do Three
Musketeers I remember saying

21:21.720 --> 21:24.630
to the AD, Lee Cleary, "What
are you shooting right now?

21:24.680 --> 21:27.390
"He said, "We've got Charlie coming
round the bend on a horse."

21:27.440 --> 21:29.910
I said, "You do, do you? Oh,
that's going to be great!

21:29.960 --> 21:32.350
"I'd get your people out
of the road." And he said,

21:32.400 --> 21:35.070
"No, no, he's going to stop right
by the camera over there."

21:35.120 --> 21:37.910
I said, "I promise you, he's not."

21:37.960 --> 21:40.470
And they called action and
you could hear the horse

21:40.520 --> 21:42.990
starts off in a kind of a
trot and then, in seconds,

21:43.040 --> 21:44.990
you could hear it's in a full gallop.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.870
~ Then off in the distance you hear, "Whoa,
~ BLEEP!
~ Whoa!

21:47.920 --> 21:51.630
~ "Whoa!
~ BLEEP!
~ Whoa!" And then he came around the corner

21:51.680 --> 21:54.630
and he's holding on to the mane.
He's let go of the reins.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.070
He's now holding on for dear life

21:57.120 --> 22:00.990
and he's hitting the horse
in the back, behind the ear.

22:01.040 --> 22:03.470
I remember Lee Cleary went,

22:03.520 --> 22:06.150
~ "Well, you weren't
~ BLEEP
~ joking there, were you?"

22:06.200 --> 22:09.430
And he didn't move
a muscle to help him.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.910
Now, we're going to
move on to your cars,

22:11.960 --> 22:14.710
~ cos I've looked at your car
history, which is pretty good.
~ Thanks.

22:14.760 --> 22:17.510
~ Cos you began with a '67 Mustang.
~ I did, yes.

22:17.560 --> 22:20.950
When I was about 17 years old,
I was living in New York

22:21.000 --> 22:24.950
and I wanted to get to Los Angeles,
and I did a print ad for Levis.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.110
And I took that money and I bought
a '67 Mustang. Six cylinder.

22:30.160 --> 22:34.870
And I learned how to drive somewhere
between New York and Maryland.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.670
And then got pretty good at it

22:36.720 --> 22:39.390
somewhere around the Texas Panhandle.

22:40.920 --> 22:43.030
~ You've got a Panamera now.
~ I do, yeah.

22:43.080 --> 22:47.510
What in the name of all that's holy
possessed you to buy a Panamera,

22:47.560 --> 22:48.950
which is not a good-looking car?

22:49.000 --> 22:52.430
It was... I think it's one of
the most beautiful interiors.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.470
~ I like those buttons, that's brilliant.
~ I think it's phenomenal.

22:56.520 --> 23:00.670
But I was actually going to shoot
24 in Cape Town in South Africa.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.710
And the flight I had was from
Los Angeles to Frankfurt

23:03.760 --> 23:05.470
and then Frankfurt to South Africa.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.950
And Porsche, before
Panamera had come out,

23:08.000 --> 23:11.670
they would take you off the plane,
take your luggage off the plane,

23:11.720 --> 23:13.310
put it in a Panamera -

23:13.360 --> 23:16.030
the Panamera was being driven
by a race-car driver -

23:16.080 --> 23:18.190
and they would take you
to the next terminal,

23:18.240 --> 23:19.910
which was about five miles away.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.830
And he would get it up to about
145mph and halfway to the terminal

23:23.880 --> 23:27.680
~ you're like, "Holy
~ BLEEP,
~ I got to get me one of these!"

23:28.360 --> 23:30.910
Anyway, the lap. How
was it out there?

23:30.960 --> 23:34.750
Well, first of all, you know,
it's an amazing experience,

23:34.800 --> 23:38.110
I have to say. I've been watching
this show for years.

23:38.160 --> 23:40.910
I've been making fun of people
driving this car all the time,

23:40.960 --> 23:43.790
and the whole time while The
Stig was driving, I'm like,

23:43.840 --> 23:47.230
"Oh, I wish I had never made fun
of anybody driving this car!"

23:47.280 --> 23:49.590
It scared the crap out of me.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.550
He got it going at such
a point where I'm like,

23:51.600 --> 23:54.190
"You're not going to make it,
you're not going to make it!"

23:54.240 --> 23:57.310
Literally I felt like that sticker
of Garfield at the back of the car,

23:57.360 --> 23:58.590
trying to crawl out.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.430
That'll be The Follow Through.
Or going through the tyres.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.070
So, who would like to see the lap?

24:04.120 --> 24:06.270
Yes!

24:06.320 --> 24:09.190
~ Can I introduce this?
~ Yes.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.710
The following events
take place in real time.

24:11.760 --> 24:14.470
I've always wanted to do that!
Here we go, let's play it.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.830
~ I like the colour.
~ Yeah, the colour stands out well.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.590
This is unusual weather
for Britain in January.

24:19.640 --> 24:23.000
This is that moment where
you think of nothing to say.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.820
Except scheisse.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.910
You could have said, "Dammit!"
We would have liked a dammit.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.630
Or maybe "Send me the schematics
of the track on my PDA."

24:32.680 --> 24:34.710
That would have been
another good one.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.670
That's very tidy through there.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.830
And - oh, yeah, that's very
well done in that weather.

24:39.880 --> 24:42.680
Come on - oh, you're
in fourth, ya prat.

24:43.560 --> 24:45.590
~ "Prat" gives it away.
~ Yes.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.750
No American's going to
say prat - or Canadian.

24:48.800 --> 24:49.990
Tidy again.

24:50.040 --> 24:52.830
Hit the brake like you hate it.

24:52.880 --> 24:57.230
Yes, look at the tech line there,
it does handle very well, that.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.510
Oh, no, wait, you've got
it understeering there.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.560
That is very slippery.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.150
It felt so much faster
when I was doing it.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.950
Yes, it's tragic.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Don't you dare take your
foot off, you pussy.

25:12.880 --> 25:17.040
~ The slower it looks, weirdly,
sometimes, the faster it is.
~ Yeah.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.310
See, look at that, staying away
from the tyres. Very smooth again.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.470
I don't know what the time
is yet, I haven't seen.

25:25.520 --> 25:28.830
~ This was the tricky part.
~ Oh, that's a tricky corner, that is.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.310
Oh, it's mean.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.150
But that is beautifully done.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.950
And, again, beautifully done around
Gambon and across the line.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.510
Well, there we are.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.310
So...

25:49.360 --> 25:51.790
where do you think you've come?

25:51.840 --> 25:56.590
~ Oh, gosh, I have...
~ Bearing in mind... OK,
these are all dry laps.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.670
The wet ones start with James Blunt.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.520
I can't remember what "FW"
stands for. It think "fairly."

26:03.160 --> 26:05.550
~ But it might not be.
~ Oh, fairly wet.

26:05.600 --> 26:10.910
I think our fastest wet lap
we've had so far is at 1.49.4.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.390
What do you think?

26:12.440 --> 26:14.030
I really haven't a clue.

26:14.080 --> 26:18.150
OK, Kiefer Sutherland,
you did it in...

26:18.200 --> 26:21.390
~ Well,
~ 1. Good.
~ That's not surprising.

26:21.440 --> 26:25.070
~ What is surprising in that
weather is the next one - 40.
~ OK.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.830
Ooh.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.880
What's terrifying me...

26:30.720 --> 26:34.230
~ .. is if, and I like James Blunt
a lot, he's a really good guy.
~ Mm-hm.

26:34.280 --> 26:39.110
~ But if James Blunt's faster than
Jack Bauer, this could end 24.
~ Yeah.

26:39.160 --> 26:40.590
OK.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.190
Right, here we go.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.550
1.49...

26:44.600 --> 26:47.910
Ooh!

26:47.960 --> 26:49.550
2. 2.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.070
So that...

26:57.440 --> 26:59.030
Are you happy with that?

26:59.080 --> 27:02.790
You know what? Yes. I've
never run on a track.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.550
I mean, anything that I've ever been
asked to do in a car, which is

27:05.600 --> 27:07.990
quite a lot of stuff,
but they basically say,

27:08.040 --> 27:11.030
"OK, I want you to go as
fast as you can, start here,

27:11.080 --> 27:13.950
"and then when you
see that bus, hit it."

27:14.960 --> 27:16.630
That, I do really well.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.470
Anyway, ladies and gentleman, can
I just say, on behalf of all us,

27:19.520 --> 27:21.830
~ thank you for coming.
~ Gosh, thank you so much.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.980
~ Kiefer Sutherland!
~ Thank you, guys, very much.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.430
Right.

27:31.480 --> 27:34.590
Tonight we are in Australia,

27:34.640 --> 27:37.870
trying to find out if
modern, complicated cars

27:37.920 --> 27:40.030
can survive the outback.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.190
Indeed, the producers had told us

27:42.240 --> 27:45.430
to drive from Darwin to
a three million acre farm,

27:45.480 --> 27:49.910
where we would have to round
up 4,000 cows using a BMW M6,

27:49.960 --> 27:54.190
~ a Bentley Continental, and a Nissan GT-R.
~ Yeah.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.110
When we left the action,
we were sitting beside

27:57.160 --> 28:01.950
a crocodile-infested swamp, trying
to catch fish for our supper.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.830
And the good news is we
survived the crocodile.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.270
We did, but we weren't
out of danger yet.

28:07.320 --> 28:10.310
Because in Australia animals
don't just like to bite, sting

28:10.360 --> 28:11.550
and strangle you,

28:11.600 --> 28:15.430
they also love to jump out in the
road and kill you in a crash.

28:15.480 --> 28:18.710
Absolutely. And that's why, before
we set off on the second day,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.670
we thought we should probably
test our brakes.

28:21.720 --> 28:25.110
So we found a long, straight,
empty piece of road -

28:25.160 --> 28:27.430
which isn't actually very
difficult in the outback -

28:27.480 --> 28:30.080
and we set up a little experiment.

28:36.520 --> 28:38.070
Here is what we've planned -

28:38.120 --> 28:41.430
Richard Hammond will drive
down this road at 60mph.

28:41.480 --> 28:44.790
When he gets to the chequered
flags over there, he will brake.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.710
Now, the Highway Code says
he will stop 240 feet later

28:48.760 --> 28:53.110
on this line here, right where
James May and I are standing.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.790
Ah, yes, but the thing is, when
the Highway Code was written,

28:55.840 --> 28:57.590
cars were small and light.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.350
That Bentley weighs
two and a half tonnes.

29:00.400 --> 29:01.950
Yeah, two and a half tonnes.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.100
So, let's see how long
it takes him to stop it.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.470
60mph.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.080
Braking!

29:14.680 --> 29:16.470
Highway Code.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.630
Two and a half tonne Bentley.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.420
I'll regret that.

29:21.880 --> 29:25.550
Missed opportunity. I mean, that's
never going to come along -

29:25.600 --> 29:27.670
they volunteered and everything.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.150
Was that 60mph?

29:30.200 --> 29:32.110
~ Yep.
~ Miles?
~ Miles?

29:32.160 --> 29:34.560
I'm going to mark it here, look.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.150
B for Bentley.

29:38.200 --> 29:41.630
~ And the little wing.
~ There you go.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.550
I elected to go next
in the Gran Coupe which,

29:44.600 --> 29:46.230
unlike Hammond's Bentley,

29:46.280 --> 29:50.110
didn't have carbon-ceramic brakes.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.710
I'm going to be relying
on old-fashioned steel.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.750
And the quick reactions
of a man in his prime.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.430
~ Do we need to be this far away?
~ No, we could confidently move forwards.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.870
Yeah, think who's driving.
Maybe that much.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.590
~ That much. That much.
~ OK. I'm ready.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.990
Here we go.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.510
OK, up to 60. That
does not take long.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.230
And... braking.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.670
Oh, that hurt my face!

30:17.720 --> 30:21.910
More to the point, it had
shattered Hammond's effort.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.390
What is the Highway Code on about?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.750
I don't know, what are
they talking about?

30:25.800 --> 30:29.680
The BMW had stopped in just 75 feet.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.670
Quite a target for
the Datsun to beat.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.270
What worries me is he doesn't ever
use anything he's given to the full.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.470
Give him 900 horsepower, he uses 20.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.820
~ So he might not use all the brakes?
~ No, he won't.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.680
As it turned out, he
did use all the brakes.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.510
But even so...

30:49.560 --> 30:52.910
~ Ooh!
~ I think it's actually
gone over the BM. It has.

30:52.960 --> 30:55.590
The BMW has cleaned up there.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.950
'But, although the BMW had won,

30:58.000 --> 31:00.990
'all three cars had made
a very good point.'

31:01.040 --> 31:03.950
When you go on a speed awareness
course and the man goes,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.110
"It'll take you 240 feet to stop."

31:06.160 --> 31:08.230
Just put your hand up and
go, "No, it doesn't."

31:08.280 --> 31:11.190
We have to do 70mph in
Britain on the motorway,

31:11.240 --> 31:14.070
because somebody might have a Ford
Anglia and it will take them

31:14.120 --> 31:17.670
that long to stop. But if you're
driving a good car like this - well,

31:17.720 --> 31:19.550
any one of ours, really -

31:19.600 --> 31:24.510
~ you should be allowed to go 140... 210mph.
~ Yeah.

31:24.560 --> 31:27.600
I shouldn't have to suffer because
somebody's still got an Anglia.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.950
Having established that our
cars could stop on a stamp,

31:33.000 --> 31:35.140
we let them off the leash.

31:42.840 --> 31:48.040
542 horsepower from a twin-turbo V6.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.720
It is absolutely ballistic.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.950
The mid-range thrust of this, when
you're midway through a corner,

32:00.000 --> 32:03.070
it just... phwoar...

32:03.120 --> 32:05.080
launches itself.

32:06.840 --> 32:09.670
I think in this you could give
some pretty good sports cars

32:09.720 --> 32:11.720
a pretty big surprise.

32:16.640 --> 32:20.430
In the early days, BMW's
M cars sounded like

32:20.480 --> 32:22.790
500 yards of ripping calico

32:22.840 --> 32:27.230
and they had telepathic steering
and they were magnificent.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.470
In recent years, though,

32:29.520 --> 32:31.710
some of the magic has sort of gone.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.600
With this one, though, it is back.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.840
It is properly back.

32:43.440 --> 32:48.360
God, this is just...
electrifyingly good.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.870
Soon the producers
told us to pull over

32:52.920 --> 32:56.310
for some kind of motor racing event.

32:56.360 --> 32:59.300
What manner of thing
will it be, I wonder?

33:00.480 --> 33:02.670
The mystery deepened when we arrived

33:02.720 --> 33:06.320
and were given idiotic
health and safety outfits.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.240
But then all was revealed.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.600
Holy cow!

33:21.520 --> 33:24.230
Most of the steel used
to build modern China

33:24.280 --> 33:27.950
came out of this vast
hole in the ground.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.800
But today it would be our racetrack.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.550
Must be a hill climb.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.990
~ Like Goodwood.
~ Yeah, it is.
~ It's not exactly like...
~ Not exactly, no.

33:40.040 --> 33:45.350
Every single corner has got a drop
on it that's... lethal. Oh, hello.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.000
Oh, it's you.

33:47.880 --> 33:51.070
"You will now take it in turns to
drive up the hill climb course..."

33:51.120 --> 33:54.910
~ It is, yeah.
~ ".. attempting to beat a benchmark time."

33:54.960 --> 33:58.910
~ Let me guess, the benchmark
time is set by The Stig?
~ It isn't The Stig.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.670
But it is... The Stig's
Australian cousin.

34:08.639 --> 34:11.110
~ He's bigger than English Stig.
~ Mm.

34:11.159 --> 34:13.870
And he's got a bigger... sausage.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.909
~ How did you find that out?
~ Well, look.

34:15.960 --> 34:20.080
~ Even from here, one can see that he is a...
~ Big Stig.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.590
Big Stig would be laying
down the gauntlet

34:23.639 --> 34:26.190
in a typical Aussie sportscar -

34:26.239 --> 34:28.480
a Holden Ute.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.790
~ You know that, whatever it's called, Maloo?
~ Yeah.

34:32.840 --> 34:37.040
~ It's got more horsepower than my BMW.
~ Has it?
~ Two more.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.030
Three, two, one, go!

34:47.360 --> 34:50.639
Whoa, that's a spectacular
thing to look at.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.720
~ Oh, no!
~ Oh, he's gone a bit sideways there. What...?

35:06.320 --> 35:09.720
~ Am I the only one who really likes that Ute?
~ Yes, you are.
~ OK.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.910
And they're ready, steady, and...

35:15.960 --> 35:17.390
across the line.

35:17.440 --> 35:20.640
Gordon Bennett, he was... Oof.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.670
As Big Stig's dust settled,
the three of us

35:24.720 --> 35:27.520
made our way to the
bottom of the mine.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.030
~ I'll win this.
~ I seriously doubt that.

35:31.080 --> 35:33.790
~ Well, I will or he will cos
we've got four-wheel drive.
~ It's true.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.630
Four-wheel drive is useful on a
tractor but on a normal road car

35:36.680 --> 35:39.750
~ it's pointless. It's like water.
~ How's it like water?

35:39.800 --> 35:42.630
Cos it's neither good nor bad,
it just doesn't do anything.

35:42.680 --> 35:44.950
Water's useful for a lot of things.

35:45.000 --> 35:48.190
It is if you put hops in it,
or grapes. But on its own...

35:48.240 --> 35:50.510
When was the last time
a rear-wheel drive car

35:50.560 --> 35:52.590
won the World Rally Championship?

35:52.640 --> 35:55.070
~ Huh!
~ Oh... recently.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.430
~ Not that recently.
~ In my mind, it was.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.630
~ It was 1983 and that was yesterday.
~ Correct.

35:59.680 --> 36:02.110
Ever since then it's been four-wheel.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.990
~ That's a rally stage, isn't it?
~ I shall do this first.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.840
~ And you will witness poetry.
~ Fire away.

36:09.040 --> 36:14.030
In front of a crowd of bemused
miners, I prepared for my run.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.590
Traction control... off.

36:16.640 --> 36:19.200
Three, two, one, go!

36:21.640 --> 36:24.310
It's struggling for traction already!

36:24.960 --> 36:28.550
Second, still spinning
the wheels. Third!

36:28.600 --> 36:30.750
Still spinning the wheels.

36:30.800 --> 36:34.390
Maybe I should have kept
the traction control on.

36:34.440 --> 36:37.270
Ohhh!

36:37.320 --> 36:38.670
Slithering.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.190
Big slide.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.070
God above.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.990
What if, all of a sudden - twoo! -

36:47.040 --> 36:49.310
and then we just saw the
underside of the BMW.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.700
Could check the exhaust is OK.

36:57.800 --> 37:02.440
Come on, Beemer, give
me that 575 horsepower!

37:05.760 --> 37:08.230
Four-wheel drive is for the weak.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.320
180kph!

37:13.400 --> 37:16.400
And through the lorries
and across the line!

37:18.960 --> 37:20.750
Next, the Bentley.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.950
And the magnificent country residence
of the Duke of Marlborough

37:24.000 --> 37:26.350
takes its place on the starting line.

37:26.400 --> 37:30.150
I'm going to bias the suspension
slightly towards soft.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.230
I might get more traction that way.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.830
Three, two, one, go!

37:35.880 --> 37:39.440
Grip, grip, grip! Good girl.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.150
After just 100 metres,

37:45.200 --> 37:49.440
the four-wheel drive Bentley was
four seconds ahead of the BMW.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.540
Into the hairpin.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.760
Oh, four-wheel drive helping
me round that a treat.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.700
Hairpin.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.350
The China and silverware
is going to fall over

38:10.400 --> 38:14.300
and make a terrible mess for
the butler to clear up later.

38:14.520 --> 38:19.160
Right, braking, ready for
the... Oh, God, turn here...

38:20.720 --> 38:22.990
Come on, bite! There you go.

38:31.360 --> 38:32.790
Right, viewers, now we're alone,

38:32.840 --> 38:35.030
look, that car should be
the fastest up that course

38:35.080 --> 38:37.950
but with the best will in the
world, I'm not going to be,

38:38.000 --> 38:39.870
so I've got a plan.

38:42.280 --> 38:46.030
English Stig. I've been carrying
him around for days.

38:46.080 --> 38:48.590
With English Stig smuggled
into the driving seat,

38:48.640 --> 38:51.990
the GT-R readied for the off.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.910
Here he is, look. "Hello."

38:53.960 --> 38:57.760
Three, two, one, go!

39:03.200 --> 39:05.870
~ That's quite a vigorous start.
~ Hello!

39:12.480 --> 39:16.180
~ Um...that was a racing
line, there, did you see?
~ Yeah.

39:22.720 --> 39:26.000
~ None of what I'm seeing...
~ Makes sense?
~ .. is possible.

39:35.760 --> 39:39.280
~ Oh, my God.
~ He's twitching, he's actually...
~ Oh, my...!

39:45.040 --> 39:46.670
Where's he going?

39:46.720 --> 39:51.020
He forgot where the end... Well,
he did something James May-ish.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.390
Thanks very much.

39:57.440 --> 39:59.000
Here he is.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.390
~ That was very quick.
~ Yeah.
~ It was vigorous.
~ Four-wheel drive.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.030
~ It's a good car. It flatters.
~ It does.
~ I'm not saying...

40:08.080 --> 40:11.350
You're right to say it. I... You
know, I wasn't that confident,

40:11.400 --> 40:14.550
~ but it does look after you all the way.
~ We have the times here anyway.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.600
The Australian Stig in the
HSV Maloo did a 1:17.8.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.350
~ I was a little bit slower,
as it's turned out.
~ Really?
~ Go on.

40:24.400 --> 40:25.510
He was 1:17.8.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.270
I was 1:31.6.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.430
That is slower, isn't it?

40:29.480 --> 40:32.990
Bentley... 1:18.6.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.870
~ Oh, that's not bad.
~ That's pretty good.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.150
I'm pleased with that.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.430
You were really... You
were only a second off.

40:39.480 --> 40:40.710
I was on it on the old Bentley.

40:40.760 --> 40:44.000
GT-R. 1:13.3.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.960
Four and a half seconds
faster than a Stig.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.320
~ Well done, you.
~ Thank you.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.390
'As we got back on the
road, I could accept that

40:57.440 --> 41:00.950
'four-wheel drive makes
sense in an iron ore mine.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.310
'But James's time...

41:02.360 --> 41:04.320
'no.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.880
1 minute 13 seconds, James May.

41:10.560 --> 41:14.790
It normally takes James May 1 minute
13 seconds to go through a door.

41:14.840 --> 41:16.150
How did he do that?

41:16.200 --> 41:20.240
'And more to the point,
how did our cars do that?'

41:21.360 --> 41:24.110
To be in this Bentley
hammering up that hill,

41:24.160 --> 41:27.670
you're asking a lot
of a modern luxury car

41:27.720 --> 41:29.710
weighing the best part
of two and a half tonnes.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.230
It did it.

41:33.520 --> 41:35.750
'After a dirty, dusty day,

41:35.800 --> 41:39.680
'we were looking forward to
staying in an actual hotel.

41:41.280 --> 41:45.270
'Sadly, though, this was
the only one for miles.'

41:46.880 --> 41:49.320
~ Evening.
~ Evening.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.270
~ Is that a bed?
~ Is it?
~ Yeah.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.840
'Jeremy, therefore, suggested
we should leave immediately...

42:03.360 --> 42:07.240
'.. and try a new type of tenting
that he'd just thought of.'

42:11.320 --> 42:12.710
What are you doing?

42:12.760 --> 42:16.470
~ Most people build a campfire
and then sit around it, yes?
~ Yes.

42:16.520 --> 42:20.510
What I've done is built
the campfire round us.

42:20.560 --> 42:21.950
So we can sit in the middle,

42:22.000 --> 42:23.590
cook our salmonella

42:23.640 --> 42:26.990
and none of all the dangerous
animals can get at us.

42:27.040 --> 42:30.310
I have revolutionised tenting,
is what I've done.

42:30.360 --> 42:31.750
Hang on.

42:31.800 --> 42:35.270
~ What are you doing now?
~ What's the best way of starting a fire?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.350
Petrol.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.520
What must the world look
like from inside that head?

42:42.840 --> 42:44.710
~ Are you ready?
~ Yes.

42:48.720 --> 42:52.590
Behold! For I have made
fire all around us!

42:52.640 --> 42:54.590
~ Brilliant. Jeremy...
~ It's quite warm.
~ What?

42:54.640 --> 42:55.870
One of the many advantages of

42:55.920 --> 42:58.110
a single traditional campfire
that you sit round

42:58.160 --> 43:00.670
is that you can move out of the
way of where the smoke is going.

43:00.720 --> 43:03.750
Yeah. You can't with mine,
but we are safe. Get down low.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.750
~ Down low. It's better.
~ I already am down low.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.630
~ It's worse.
~ No, it's better here.

43:07.680 --> 43:10.830
~ Anyway...
~ What?
~ Where are the tents?

43:10.880 --> 43:12.910
In the cars.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.960
~ Well...
~ You plum sack.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.190
'The next morning, after
another dreadful night,

43:22.240 --> 43:24.800
'we were back on the road.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.350
'And after about four hours,

43:28.400 --> 43:31.990
'Professor Hammond finally
realised something.'

43:33.480 --> 43:35.880
It's big. It is big, Australia.

43:37.480 --> 43:41.550
'We were headed for the gigantic
farm where we'd be herding cattle,

43:41.600 --> 43:45.590
'and had decided to try
and reach it in one day.

43:45.640 --> 43:49.200
'The drive would be... enormous.'

43:50.320 --> 43:53.870
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with T.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.120
Tree.

43:56.440 --> 43:59.230
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with T.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.000
Termite mound.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.310
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with T.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.500
It's "tree". Just stop it!

44:08.360 --> 44:10.150
'Since Hammond wouldn't play,

44:10.200 --> 44:14.430
'I tuned into the only station
that my radio could receive.'

'.. lightweight heifers out
of Darwin heading to Indonesia

44:18.400 --> 44:21.950

44:22.000 --> 44:27.070
'Fattening steers heading to
Indonesia up to 2.45 a kilo.'

44:27.120 --> 44:30.160
Why don't you play Steely Dan?!

44:31.520 --> 44:34.830

convoy of gigantic road trains.'

44:46.600 --> 44:49.840
'We were actually quite looking
forward to the peril.'

44:56.640 --> 44:58.510
A lot of dust coming up here.

44:58.560 --> 45:02.350
'But in cars as fast as
ours, it was a doddle.'

45:02.400 --> 45:04.670
I'm out of the way. I'm free.

45:07.400 --> 45:10.830
'At one o'clock, I had
a delicious Aussie lunch.'

45:10.880 --> 45:12.990
"Bloody hot ring-burner."

45:13.040 --> 45:16.040
'And then it was back
to business as usual.'

45:17.280 --> 45:20.430
'C2 heifers sell from 160-176.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.990

Joy of joys!

two hours to reach

45:57.560 --> 46:00.550

46:00.600 --> 46:01.990
~ Welcome.
~ Thank you.

'.. where there were
no spare bedrooms.

new sort of tenting.'

~ Do you know what?
~ What?
~ We started this, I liked all three cars.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.470
I still do.

46:17.520 --> 46:21.190
But my conviction that the Bentley
is the best is now absolute.

46:21.240 --> 46:22.390
I just...

46:22.440 --> 46:25.510
~ I still find it slightly sort of...
~ What?

46:25.560 --> 46:28.350
There's a slight hint of
faux-toffery about it,

46:28.400 --> 46:30.230
which suits you very well, obviously.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.190
But the great thing
about the Nissan is

46:32.240 --> 46:34.990
it's just a finely honed
driving instrument.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.830
Well, no... OK, on the
Nurburgring, yours is...

46:37.880 --> 46:39.310
Don't mention the Nurburgring.

46:39.360 --> 46:41.990
~ That's what it's for, James.
~ No, it's not.
~ And Jeremy, your BM.

46:42.040 --> 46:44.070
~ It does look brilliant.
~ There you go.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.110
It's a very competent
motorcar, the BMW.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.470
That's damning with faint
praise, that is, May.

46:48.520 --> 46:49.790
Yes, exactly.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.230
Yours is a bit too Dolce & Gabbana.

46:52.280 --> 46:54.030
Yours is a bit too Poundland.

46:54.080 --> 46:57.110
They're both brilliant
cars, make no mistake.

46:57.160 --> 47:00.230
~ What are you doing, by the way?
~ Claymores. They're mines.

47:00.280 --> 47:01.550
I brought them from Britain.

47:01.600 --> 47:04.310
Ring our campsite with claymores.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.790
Then any animal that comes...

47:06.840 --> 47:09.640
.. they will... it
will become a veneer.

47:11.640 --> 47:15.550
'When my work was done and May and
Hammond had drunk all the beer,

47:15.600 --> 47:17.870
'we turned in for the night.'

47:23.200 --> 47:26.480
~ What was that?!
~ That was the sound of me saving your life.

47:30.800 --> 47:35.520
'The next morning, our campsite
looks like an abattoir.'

47:37.920 --> 47:41.270
~ What's this?
~ Crocodile's ear.

47:41.320 --> 47:44.310
~ It's hairy.
~ Crocodiles do have hairy ears.

47:44.360 --> 47:45.710
They don't even have ears.

47:45.760 --> 47:48.630
They do. That was a crocodile
that was coming to eat us.

47:48.680 --> 47:50.870
And my claymore saved our lives.

47:50.920 --> 47:52.390
Look what we've got here, Hammond.

47:52.440 --> 47:53.870
It's a crocodile's hoof(!)

47:53.920 --> 47:57.070
You've detonated one
of the man's cows.

47:57.120 --> 48:00.790
Let's not get bogged down
with..."ooh, blew up," all right?

48:00.840 --> 48:04.270
Because I've been reading
about this farm.

48:04.320 --> 48:08.710
~ Yes.
~ It's actually 3.2 million acres.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.430
So another 200,000 acres
just slipped in there?

48:11.480 --> 48:13.190
And to put that in perspective,

48:13.240 --> 48:17.990
this single farm is the same
size as Buckinghamshire...

48:18.040 --> 48:20.670
and Hertfordshire... and Surrey...

48:20.720 --> 48:24.710
and East Sussex and West
Sussex and Kent, combined.

48:24.760 --> 48:28.480
It's the same size as the
South East of England!

48:31.800 --> 48:37.240
'Everything you see here, and
a lot more besides, is one farm.

48:40.080 --> 48:42.990
'And as we set off
to do cattle herding,

48:43.040 --> 48:45.550
'we were still struggling
to get our heads

48:45.600 --> 48:48.000
'around the enormity of it all.'

48:49.160 --> 48:53.550
It's 250 miles from this farm
to the nearest supermarket.

48:53.600 --> 48:57.190
That's like driving from
London to Newcastle

48:57.240 --> 49:01.430
just to buy some washing-up
liquid and some bog roll.

49:01.480 --> 49:03.590
And it's not driving on motorways.

49:03.640 --> 49:06.940
It's not the A1 and it's
not the M1, it's tracks.

49:09.120 --> 49:14.600
In Britain, the average beef herd
is between, sort of, 28 and 50 cows.

49:15.880 --> 49:18.520
And here it's 64,000.

49:22.280 --> 49:25.070
'Our task was to round
up 4,000 of them,

49:25.120 --> 49:28.420
'and we assumed this many
would be easy to spot.'

49:29.680 --> 49:34.470
~ Now, have you raised your
suspension up, Hammond?
~ Yes, I have.

49:34.520 --> 49:38.520
~ Can you see any cows?
~ No, no. Not one.

49:39.720 --> 49:42.150
But we could be in the
equivalent of Dover

49:42.200 --> 49:44.070
and the cows could
be in Beaconsfield.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.950
Well, I was just thinking that.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.710
What if they're all in
the opposite corner?

49:48.760 --> 49:51.960
They could be 100 miles
away from here.

49:54.920 --> 49:58.230
'Even the hi-tech BMW was no help.'

49:58.280 --> 50:03.030
'Voice commands. New entry.
Spell name of place.'

50:03.080 --> 50:04.590
Some cows.

50:04.640 --> 50:06.590
'Did you mean Sheep Hills?'

50:06.640 --> 50:09.030
No, not sheep. Cows.

50:09.080 --> 50:11.870
What's the noise you
make to attract a cow?

50:11.920 --> 50:14.150
If it was a dog it would be...

50:14.200 --> 50:16.350
I don't know anything about cows...

50:16.400 --> 50:18.800
apart from what they taste like.

50:20.760 --> 50:25.640
It is difficult to be a cowboy
when we can't find any cows.

50:28.320 --> 50:30.260
41 degrees out there.

50:32.680 --> 50:34.020
No cows.

50:35.600 --> 50:40.750
'After an hour's meandering about,
however, we struck gold.'

50:40.800 --> 50:42.190
Cow!

50:42.240 --> 50:44.670
Over there. Yes, cows!

50:44.720 --> 50:47.230
I'm counting four cows.

50:47.280 --> 50:50.590
That is a start. Get
'em, round 'em up.

50:50.640 --> 50:53.740
You two take the flanks,
I'll stay at the rear.

50:59.720 --> 51:03.790
Don't get too close. If you panic
'em, you'll spoil the burgers.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.710
We've got them. We have them.

51:05.760 --> 51:07.500
This is perfect.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.950
We're brilliant at this!

51:14.000 --> 51:15.800
'But then...'

51:17.560 --> 51:19.870
They're going to brake
and go in the woods.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.830
They're getting into the trees!

51:22.880 --> 51:25.480
I can't go in there. It's too rough.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.310
'And even though Hammond
had four-wheel drive,

51:28.360 --> 51:31.590
'it turned out he couldn't
go in there either.'

51:35.560 --> 51:37.300
Um, I'm beached.

51:37.960 --> 51:41.030
'And by the time James
had pulled him out...'

51:41.080 --> 51:43.920
Three, two, one. Action!

51:47.800 --> 51:50.340
'..our four cows had wandered off.'

51:53.120 --> 51:56.150
Sitrep - we found four
cows and we lost them.

51:56.200 --> 52:02.440
'So, what chance would we
have when we found 4,000?'

52:11.080 --> 52:12.470
Right.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.120
Right.

52:15.440 --> 52:19.190
Now, this is the biggest
flock of cows

52:19.240 --> 52:22.000
I have ever seen in my entire life.

52:25.960 --> 52:28.870
'Our job was to get
them all turned round

52:28.920 --> 52:33.400
'and then herd them into a giant
pen, which was 10km away...

52:35.000 --> 52:38.920
'.. a pretty tall order for
three cars like these.'

52:40.720 --> 52:43.920
It's like Zulu, watching
them coming towards us.

52:50.800 --> 52:52.270
Here we go.

52:53.960 --> 52:57.000
Has anyone got any
plans, cos I haven't?

52:58.320 --> 53:01.950
'Hammond suggested we break
the herd into smaller chunks.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.750
'But that didn't work at all.'

53:04.800 --> 53:07.880
They're going in completely
the wrong direction now.

53:12.360 --> 53:15.660
Oh, now... How are they...?
What, they've gone...

53:22.120 --> 53:25.550
They're just going round me.
They are not very scared of me.

53:25.600 --> 53:29.870
I'm in the middle. I've been herded
by the cows. It's all gone wrong.

53:29.920 --> 53:34.390
~ Clarkson, where the hell are you?
~ I am now in cow dust.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.240
I can see nothing.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.790
OK, they're charging
me. This is unexpected.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.040
They're running towards me.

53:43.440 --> 53:47.400
We are in the middle of the cows.
We've been outwitted by cows.

53:49.640 --> 53:52.670
Um, nice cows. Morning, cows.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.790
That bull's menacing me.

53:59.040 --> 54:01.270
This is a remarkably brave cow.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.910
It won't be pushed
back into line at all.

54:03.960 --> 54:06.700
When I say "cow",
I mean massive bull.

54:09.360 --> 54:13.470
I may need some help here.
This guy is properly stubborn.

54:13.520 --> 54:15.750
I shall call you James May.

54:15.800 --> 54:17.940
He fears the Nissan more.

54:18.880 --> 54:23.270
'And as it turned out, that
wasn't entirely accurate.'

54:25.080 --> 54:27.020
He's head-butting me!

54:30.840 --> 54:33.040
He head-butted your Datsun.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.990
'Meanwhile, back in the Bentley...'

54:40.760 --> 54:42.320
Jeremy!

54:43.800 --> 54:46.390
'Clearly, things weren't going well,

54:46.440 --> 54:48.510
'so we made a decision.'

54:50.760 --> 54:53.470
I think there are too many for us.

54:53.520 --> 54:55.190
Well, yes.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.470
We need the cavalry.

54:57.520 --> 55:00.640
'And ten minutes later, it arrived.'

55:08.840 --> 55:10.750
Ho-ho-ho!

55:10.800 --> 55:13.430
One of the most dangerous
jobs in the world,

55:13.480 --> 55:16.720
flying the Robinson helicopters
to muster the cattle.

55:17.960 --> 55:21.190
On average, round about eight
are killed every year.

55:21.240 --> 55:25.920
Sometimes they will use the skids
to actually push the cows into line.

55:28.560 --> 55:33.600
'With the air cav as backup, we
started to get our act together.'

55:36.200 --> 55:39.430
Hammond, you're the rough
terrain response.

55:39.480 --> 55:41.550
And I'm the quick response.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.830
That's good, that's good.

55:43.880 --> 55:46.750
Channel 'em in, I'll
drive them forwards.

55:50.680 --> 55:53.190
Flanking, flanking.

55:53.240 --> 55:54.830
Go on, go left.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.150
♪ I was riding my horse... ♪

55:59.160 --> 56:00.760
Braking right.

56:01.760 --> 56:04.100
Good work, Hammond, good work.

56:05.600 --> 56:10.150
That Bentley going across that
field is a sight to behold.

56:10.200 --> 56:12.540
Look at... Look at its wheels!

56:14.840 --> 56:17.190
'Soon, we realised something.'

56:17.240 --> 56:19.640
Ah, there you go. Look at that.

56:21.720 --> 56:26.110
'For once, Top Gear was being
ambitious and not rubbish.'

57:56.520 --> 58:00.030
~ All right, cowboy!
~ I feel pretty manly!

58:00.080 --> 58:02.480
I feel like one of those bulls.

58:07.560 --> 58:09.990
~ I loved that.
~ I thought that was fun.

58:10.040 --> 58:13.510
~ That was a lot of fun.
~ It was.
~ And these cars...

58:13.560 --> 58:16.430
~ better than horses.
~ And nobody fell off.
~ Much better.
~ Yeah.

58:16.480 --> 58:17.870
But can we just stop for a moment?

58:17.920 --> 58:21.670
The amazing thing - the cars survived
it. Nothing broke. All three.

58:21.720 --> 58:24.750
Fantastic. And if Nissan... well,
actually, or Bentley or BMW,

58:24.800 --> 58:28.150
if they made a laptop, I'd buy it.

58:28.200 --> 58:31.590
You could throw a Nissan laptop
in the lavatory, do a log on it...

58:32.880 --> 58:35.110
.. and you'd still be
able to log on on it.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.950
You would. Anyway...

58:37.000 --> 58:41.110
we must now decide which
of these cars is the best.

58:41.160 --> 58:43.470
Well, I'm not backing
down. It's the Bentley.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.390
I'm not backing down.
It is this Nissan.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.590
James, sorry, mate.
You are just wrong.

58:49.640 --> 58:52.710
The Nissan GT-R, it has a
whiff of the Nurburgring.

58:52.760 --> 58:56.030
It's not just a whiff of the
Nurburgring. It reeks of it!

58:56.080 --> 58:58.990
Your clothes will smell of it six
weeks after you've been in it.

58:59.040 --> 59:01.710
It's better than it smelling
of Ryan Giggs's bath water.

59:01.760 --> 59:04.510
Mate, it's a Bentley.

59:04.560 --> 59:07.430
~ Think what that means.
~ I'll tell you what it means, Hammond.

59:07.480 --> 59:12.630
It means it is £66,000
more expensive than this.

59:12.680 --> 59:15.910
Yes, because that's a Nissan!
That's a Bentley.

59:15.960 --> 59:18.910
Exactly. It's a Nissan. And when you
strip everything off this Nissan,

59:18.960 --> 59:20.670
you find underneath a racing car.

59:20.720 --> 59:23.150
When you strip all the
stuff off of that Bentley,

59:23.200 --> 59:25.870
underneath it is a VW.

59:25.920 --> 59:28.510
If we strip all the stuff off you,

59:28.560 --> 59:30.870
we'd find underneath
the same basic skeleton

59:30.920 --> 59:32.910
as you would find in a racing driver.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.710
But when we put it all back on,
as we must, to make you James May,

59:35.760 --> 59:37.950
you're James May! That's
the wrong car.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.550
Yes, but, Hammond, if we stripped
everything off of you,

59:40.600 --> 59:44.350
we'd find the same skeleton that you have
in a racing driver when he was a little boy!

59:44.400 --> 59:47.550
But when you put it all back together,
you are still Richard Hammond.

59:47.600 --> 59:52.390
You in that GT-R is like
you in those shoes.

59:52.440 --> 59:53.550
Ridiculous!

59:53.600 --> 59:58.710
Says the man in the jacket
woven out of 100% pure 1935.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.790
That was designed very
specifically for a purpose -

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.070
to feel good on the ragged
edge of performance.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.990
You're not going to do that.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.910
You have a watch that
can go to the moon.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.470
You're never going to go to the moon.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:14.430
They don't make moon boots in your
size, but you like having that watch

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.670
because it means it is a good watch.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.590
And it's the same with the car.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.840
~ You're just being a
~ BLEEP.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.710
Thank you.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.670
~ And you've got a
~ BLEEP
~ like a
~ BLEEP BLEEP.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:32.390
A baby one.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.950
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, gentlemen,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.430
I'm sorry, I'm going to have
to interrupt at this point,

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.870
because the fact of the matter is,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:42.670
by any measurable means you choose,
the BMW is the best car.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.230
~ But... Y...
~ But I wouldn't buy one.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:46.310
Well, why?

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.350
Because fast, expensive BMWs plummet
in value as soon as you buy them.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.670
You buy one of those,

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:54.830
within 18 months you are going
to lose £40,000, £45,000.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.630
And as a Yorkshireman, I
just couldn't handle that.

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.590
~ I really couldn't.
~ That means you have to choose one of these.
~ I know.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:04.910
I find myself now with
the casting vote.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.510
Um, the problem I have is,
OK, I'm at the precise age

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:13.150
when I'm growing out of the
Nissan and into the Bentley.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:16.390
~ That's the problem I've got.
~ And that is why you should have this.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.550
The Nissan will help you rage
against the dying of the light.

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:25.190
Rather than any of that,
you can grow old gracefully

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.710
and in comfort in the Bentley,
which is a great place to be.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.310
It's got quilted leather in there.

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.150
Hammond, quilted leather is what
an incontinence sheet looks like

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.390
if you look at it under a microscope!

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:39.710
I have made up my mind. Right
now, I've made up my mind.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.190
I'm going to ditch my Yorkshireness,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.710
not care about the depreciation,

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.560
go for the Beemer.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.150
~ You never chose...
~ The thing is...

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.310
~ You never will.
~ .. it's breathtaking, that car.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:55.550
~ All right.
~ And on that bombshell, it's time to end.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:58.430
Thank you so much for watching.
See you next week. Good night!
