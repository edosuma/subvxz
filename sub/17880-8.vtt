WEBVTT

00:07.449 --> 00:10.216
And finally, through
a small incision in the skull,

00:10.341 --> 00:13.150
the nano-device is placed
directly into the brain.

00:13.275 --> 00:14.776
Where, once it's activated,

00:14.901 --> 00:17.722
it causes everything
the subject eats to taste sweet.

00:17.847 --> 00:20.005
The implications
for weight loss are enormous.

00:20.130 --> 00:22.897
And while elective brain surgery
doesn't test that great,

00:23.141 --> 00:25.844
it still tests better
than dieting and exercise.

00:26.796 --> 00:29.695
Excellent work, everybody.
Thanks for staying late.

00:32.115 --> 00:32.915
Shoot.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.358
- What's the matter?
- My driver died a few days ago,

00:36.483 --> 00:38.245
and I haven't gotten
a replacement yet.

00:38.645 --> 00:40.957
I'm sorry.
I could give you a ride home.

00:41.922 --> 00:43.084
I suppose that's OK,

00:43.252 --> 00:45.544
but I can't start you at what
my old driver was getting.

00:45.807 --> 00:48.422
You don't have to pay me.
I thought it would be a nice thing .

00:51.093 --> 00:52.430
All right, yes.

00:52.555 --> 00:53.761
Thank you.
Right?

00:55.180 --> 00:56.398
Thank you? Yes.

00:56.656 --> 00:59.141
I'll go get my things. Can we stop
and do an errand on the way?

00:59.309 --> 01:00.120
Sure.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.465
Still free.

01:02.590 --> 01:04.063
Then pull the car around.

01:08.029 --> 01:09.381
We've never gotten along.

01:09.506 --> 01:12.154
I figured maybe some one-on-one time
might thaw the chill.

01:12.634 --> 01:15.355
- I thought Veronica lived here.
- Me, too.

01:15.641 --> 01:18.723
She just finds a comfortable chair
and powers down for the night.

01:22.488 --> 01:23.989
Come on, we're gonna be late.

01:24.114 --> 01:26.460
You're the one who didn't
wanna share the bathroom mirror.

01:26.829 --> 01:29.839
Hey, guys, I thought maybe
we'd go to Mctaggert's for beers.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.946
Now, tonight, without warning?

01:32.071 --> 01:34.468
Don't you have to get home
to your daughter?

01:34.636 --> 01:37.385
Her mom's visiting after a year
in Botswana, which, by the way

01:37.510 --> 01:39.390
is a year Botswana's
never gonna get back.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.831
Anyway, they're hanging in New-York
for a week

01:42.956 --> 01:45.817
until Stacy finds another country
to go fix

01:45.942 --> 01:47.815
so she doesn't have
to work on herself.

01:49.395 --> 01:50.317
I'm free.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.549
I wish my wife would go to Botswana.

01:52.674 --> 01:54.991
The thing is, we kind of have plans.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.521
Although, if you wanted to...

01:59.268 --> 02:00.119
I see.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.954
You're going someplace
you don't want me to come.

02:03.079 --> 02:05.416
- That's cool.
- You'd think it was lame.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.709
I promise I wouldn't.

02:07.405 --> 02:09.960
- Then maybe...
- Phil, can I talk to you for a minute?

02:10.277 --> 02:11.255
Not about you.

02:17.952 --> 02:19.375
An occasional drink is fine,

02:19.500 --> 02:21.766
but being friends with your boss
is a slippery slope.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.935
Guys, we can get past the boss thing.
I consider you friends.

02:26.081 --> 02:27.873
Can I talk to you away for a minute?

02:27.998 --> 02:29.190
Still not about you.

02:31.456 --> 02:34.046
You think you're their friend,
but when push comes to shove,

02:34.171 --> 02:35.780
they're always your boss. {\and
they know it.}

02:35.957 --> 02:39.325
But Ted is not like that.
He's a good guy. Don't touch that!

02:40.533 --> 02:42.828
Besides, Ted could bring us
a lot of street crud.

02:43.171 --> 02:44.288
It's streetcred.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.540
You know... "credibility"?

02:48.796 --> 02:50.419
Now that finally makes sense.

02:52.897 --> 02:55.014
Thanks for swinging
by my grandmother's place

02:55.139 --> 02:57.727
and for helping me
carry all her possessions.

02:57.976 --> 03:00.340
You're really handling all this
pretty well.

03:00.465 --> 03:03.772
I can't believe your grandmother
and your driver both died

03:03.897 --> 03:05.630
- in the same week.
- What?

03:06.218 --> 03:09.021
That's funny.
They were the same person.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.690
You hired your own grandmother
to drive you around?

03:11.858 --> 03:14.026
She need money,
but she didn't want a handout.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.338
She was a very proud woman
and a very proud driver.

03:17.803 --> 03:21.367
You wanna maybe talk about her?
How you're feeling about losing her?

03:21.882 --> 03:23.911
That's sweet, but... No.

03:24.322 --> 03:25.391
Are you sure?

03:26.832 --> 03:29.095
It could change our relationship
and make it difficult

03:29.220 --> 03:31.085
to continue working together.

03:32.776 --> 03:35.214
But I suppose that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

03:35.931 --> 03:38.343
Or...
I could just go.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.303
Don't be silly. Let's talk.
Would you like some wine?

03:41.719 --> 03:43.764
I would like
a whole bunch of wine, yes.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.126
Okay, but we'll have
to pour it ourselves.

03:46.251 --> 03:47.977
My housekeeper died this week.

03:50.451 --> 03:52.451
I've never been
in the subbasement before.

03:52.576 --> 03:55.273
They don't want the executives down
there because of all the asbestos.

03:55.398 --> 03:57.542
When you work for a company
this intense,

03:57.667 --> 04:01.201
- you have to find ways to relax.
- We tried the Veridian chess club

04:01.326 --> 04:04.316
and the quilting club,
but those were just meat markets.

04:04.637 --> 04:08.041
Besides,
nothing relieves tension like this.

04:09.618 --> 04:10.525
Behold!

04:12.461 --> 04:15.031
Welcome to medieval fight club!

<i>Bosses, Everybody has one.</i>

04:29.225 --> 04:32.063
<i>Without bosses,
we'd be like these worms...</i>

04:32.188 --> 04:33.395
<i>Disgusting.</i>

04:34.017 --> 04:36.233
<i>Bosses make everything better.</i>

04:36.766 --> 04:38.446
<i>So listen to your boss,</i>

04:39.110 --> 04:40.988
<i>and don't question them.</i>

04:41.253 --> 04:43.649
<i>Otherwise, you're no better
than a worm...</i>

04:56.338 --> 04:58.332
You've to fight
your way up the ladder.

04:58.457 --> 05:02.468
Newbies start out as peasant farmers.
Here are your soiled rags.

05:05.415 --> 05:07.014
Sorry, we've to stay in character.

05:07.452 --> 05:09.011
The king is watching.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.996
Isn't that Gil, the IT Guy?

05:11.121 --> 05:13.682
On the surface world.
Here, he is our king.

05:13.807 --> 05:16.440
Listen, fellas,
this all seems really...

05:17.037 --> 05:17.857
Cool?

05:18.413 --> 05:20.154
Sure.
Let's go with "cool."

05:20.483 --> 05:22.321
But I think I'm gonna take off.

05:24.909 --> 05:25.741
Ted, wait!

05:26.833 --> 05:28.994
You're the first executive
that's been down here.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.413
You leaving like this
makes us look like fools.

05:31.893 --> 05:33.958
And we haven't been fools
for months.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.197
Let him go.

05:35.434 --> 05:36.604
It's not your fault.

05:36.729 --> 05:38.560
Bosses and employees
just shouldn't hang out.

05:38.685 --> 05:40.988
It's like a ventriloquist trying
to be friends with his dummy.

05:41.113 --> 05:43.507
At the end of the day, you know
who's sleeping in a suitcase.

05:43.632 --> 05:44.615
The dummy.

05:45.756 --> 05:48.445
All right, I was the one
who pushed for us to hang out,

05:48.570 --> 05:49.765
so I should endure this.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.907
I mean, suffer through...
I mean, support you.

05:54.142 --> 05:55.854
Because that's what friends do.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.519
And she married
my grandfather at 18.

06:00.644 --> 06:02.903
Now my grandfather had
an amazing life.

06:03.294 --> 06:05.018
He came to this country with nothing

06:05.143 --> 06:07.969
and made a huge fortune,
and then one day,

06:08.282 --> 06:09.521
tragically...

06:10.141 --> 06:11.355
he got deported.

06:13.601 --> 06:14.623
That's so sad.

06:16.926 --> 06:18.126
I've a question.

06:18.377 --> 06:20.509
We have been drinking all night.

06:20.634 --> 06:22.815
How can you be sotally tober

06:22.940 --> 06:25.228
when I'm completely fit chased?

06:25.510 --> 06:27.405
I've always been like this.

06:27.530 --> 06:30.337
My body just doesn't process
alcohol like that.

06:55.489 --> 06:57.404
You want one of these?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.421
You want one of these?
That's what I thought.

07:04.637 --> 07:05.758
My grandfather...

07:06.089 --> 07:07.176
I never liked him.

07:07.893 --> 07:10.214
He smelled of onions
and once cheated on my grandmother

07:10.339 --> 07:11.840
with Eleanor Roosevelt,

07:12.328 --> 07:14.099
who hated men but loved onions.

07:15.325 --> 07:16.977
Why are you telling me all of this?

07:17.719 --> 07:21.231
Because I've never told anybody.
I'm the one who turned him in.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.794
I had him deported.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.843
I declare Ted the victor...

07:51.346 --> 07:52.763
And Victor the loser.

07:54.558 --> 07:56.041
God. That was fantastic!

07:56.438 --> 07:58.728
Are you allowed to fight more
than once in one night?

07:58.853 --> 08:01.672
You've done well by bringing
a warrior of such pluck

08:01.797 --> 08:03.123
into the fold.

08:04.153 --> 08:06.187
I told you this would work out!

08:06.569 --> 08:09.528
We haven't been this celebrated
since we fixed the king's moped.

08:14.987 --> 08:17.485
My ex-wife is spoiling the hell out
of our daughter.

08:17.855 --> 08:21.198
I could spoil her, too,
but one of us has to be a good parent.

08:21.323 --> 08:22.593
Really, sweetie?

08:22.718 --> 08:24.342
Ice cream for breakfast.

08:24.823 --> 08:26.640
You're right.
I don't let you do that.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.431
You know what I do let you do?
Get vaccinated.

08:30.884 --> 08:32.551
I love you, too, Rose.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.777
That bitch is driving me crazy.

08:36.638 --> 08:38.308
- Easy.
- She's 7.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.113
Not Rose, my ex-wife.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.145
Stacy.
She was...

08:42.899 --> 08:43.730
Crazy.

08:43.898 --> 08:44.940
Crazy hot.

08:45.108 --> 08:46.123
Totally.

08:48.679 --> 08:50.312
You were an animal last night.

08:50.437 --> 08:52.991
No one has ever won
four battles in a row.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.950
That medieval fight stuff
is a blast.

08:55.652 --> 08:58.348
And it wasn't just the winning.
It was the constant winning.

08:58.676 --> 09:00.247
I can't wait to get back to it

09:00.415 --> 09:03.500
There's no meeting tonight.
We only get the basement once a week.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.182
I took care of that.

09:05.307 --> 09:07.574
I had the a. Meeting
moved to the utility closet

09:07.699 --> 09:09.131
we could have the basement.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.194
Medieval fight club
two nights in a row?

09:11.319 --> 09:13.543
Man, my codpiece just got tighter.

09:13.668 --> 09:15.846
See? It's good to be friends
with the boss,

09:16.160 --> 09:19.300
I hate to break it to you,
but we can't make it tonight.

09:19.795 --> 09:21.143
My mom's birthday...

09:22.104 --> 09:23.854
That's OK.
We'll see you next time

09:26.608 --> 09:29.517
I can't miss M.F.C.
That's how rumors start.

09:30.026 --> 09:32.322
Would it be weird for me
to bring my mother?

09:35.992 --> 09:36.992
Morning.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.974
I couldn't sleep all night.
I really messed things up with Veronica.

09:43.185 --> 09:46.543
Last night, she opened up
and told me something very personal.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.922
Now I know too much.
What if she has me fired or deported?

09:50.047 --> 09:52.257
- I mean, who knows what?
- Hello, Linda.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.842
I need to see you in my office.

09:55.238 --> 09:56.496
Hear that, everyone?

09:56.621 --> 09:58.722
Veronica needs to see all of us
in her office.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.932
Just you.

10:02.738 --> 10:04.238
I don't know why I drink.

10:04.381 --> 10:06.374
I always either get laid or fired.

10:08.471 --> 10:10.102
I have to start drinking.

10:10.462 --> 10:11.862
I like those odds.

10:13.742 --> 10:15.572
There's no easy way to say this.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.032
You're firing me.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.077
That would be easy.
You're fired.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.579
I want to say that

10:22.704 --> 10:25.469
I've been keeping that secret
about my grandfather for years,

10:25.594 --> 10:28.293
and it felt wonderful
to finally get it off my chest.

10:28.826 --> 10:31.271
Really?
I'm glad to hear that.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.966
So thank you for listening to me.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.135
We're letting you go.

10:37.676 --> 10:38.426
What?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.841
That would be another way to say it.

10:40.966 --> 10:43.684
Anyway,
I slept like a baby all night.

10:45.168 --> 10:46.179
Actually,

10:46.304 --> 10:49.022
I thought you might be afraid
that I would tell people your secret.

10:49.528 --> 10:52.234
I hadn't thought of that.
I hadn't thought of that at all.

10:52.676 --> 10:54.643
But do what you're going to do,

10:55.724 --> 10:57.403
I'm not gonna do that.

10:57.528 --> 11:00.409
We're friends.
Friends don't do things like that.

11:01.646 --> 11:02.546
Friends.

11:02.907 --> 11:04.602
I like the way that sounds.

11:04.961 --> 11:06.290
We're friends.

11:07.047 --> 11:09.501
Good.
Because you can never have too many.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.587
I used to feed my sister in her sleep
so she wouldn't be skinnier than me.

11:15.670 --> 11:18.302
You're my first friend
who's ever done something like that.

11:18.985 --> 11:21.763
It feels so good
to finally admit that to someone.

11:22.857 --> 11:25.090
Let's take the morning off
so we can talk some more.

11:25.215 --> 11:26.531
I'll take you to breakfast.

11:26.656 --> 11:29.002
Someplace where the meals
don't end with the word "slam."

11:29.189 --> 11:30.305
I don't know.

11:30.430 --> 11:32.982
I've got a lot of work to do
on the doppler project.

11:33.152 --> 11:34.723
You're with the boss.
Relax.

11:34.848 --> 11:37.362
Besides, I can give
the doppler project to Joe.

11:37.753 --> 11:40.865
Really? Because I do hate
the doppler project.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.305
And I hate Joe.
So everybody wins.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.230
No one gets in!
No one gets in!

11:59.201 --> 12:00.874
All right, I'm calling it.

12:02.220 --> 12:03.185
Did I win?

12:03.700 --> 12:05.698
He didn't get in, but no.

12:06.307 --> 12:09.559
And this defeat brings you
all the way down to court Jester.

12:10.980 --> 12:15.067
In order to advance to squire, there is
but one knave standing in your way.

12:17.233 --> 12:19.029
I propose a mutual surrender.

12:19.431 --> 12:21.907
Valiant try, you giant ball of wuss.

12:22.258 --> 12:23.969
I declare Ted the victor.

12:28.187 --> 12:29.788
Guys, no hard feelings?

12:30.890 --> 12:33.710
We like that you're successful
at everything you do.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.422
And you realize a forfeit takes you down
to court Jester as well.

12:38.353 --> 12:39.545
Fine, whatever.

12:39.853 --> 12:43.011
But it's going to be the same jokes
you heard last month.

12:52.609 --> 12:54.830
- Your hair looks nice.
- You like it?

12:54.955 --> 12:56.553
She took us out
to get our hair done.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.362
We've been spending tons and tons
and tons of time together this week.

13:00.772 --> 13:02.279
At least you two are bonding.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.878
We're not bonding.
I'm being absorbed.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.202
Whatever it is you're doing, keep it up,
because your hair looks great.

13:08.372 --> 13:11.144
- You think I care what my hair...
- <i>Linda then loudly explained</i>

13:11.333 --> 13:13.563
<i>that her hair wasn't important
to her right now,</i>

13:13.688 --> 13:16.559
<i>because being friends
with Veronica came at a price.</i>

13:16.684 --> 13:18.348
<i>Sure, there was shopping.</i>

13:18.473 --> 13:20.294
I once slept
with my boyfriend's therapist

13:20.419 --> 13:22.332
to find out
if he was cheating on me.

13:22.924 --> 13:23.924
He wasn't.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.513
<i>And there were massages...</i>

13:27.638 --> 13:29.401
And then I accused Omar Sharif

13:29.526 --> 13:32.467
of being a terrorist
so he'd get kicked off a plane

13:32.592 --> 13:34.863
and I could take
his first-class seat.

13:38.105 --> 13:39.855
<i>And midnight girl talk...</i>

13:43.620 --> 13:46.116
It's me.
I'd ask you over, but...

13:46.288 --> 13:49.032
My sister's in town
for my grandmother's funeral.

13:50.925 --> 13:53.610
<i>But the friendship came
with a price.</i>

13:54.375 --> 13:56.778
Veronica keeps dumping all this stuff
on me.

13:56.903 --> 14:00.005
I'm like her brain toilet.
I don't know how much more I can take.

14:00.192 --> 14:02.747
Because she's your boss doesn't mean
you have to put up with it

14:02.872 --> 14:04.509
or jump every time she calls you.

14:06.858 --> 14:08.722
- Is he coming?
- Just go. Go!

14:08.962 --> 14:11.224
That's weird.
I could've sworn they saw me.

14:14.492 --> 14:17.087
Hey, friend. I was thinking
we'd have lunch today.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.562
1:00? Excellent.

14:18.687 --> 14:20.626
I don't think that's such
a good idea.

14:20.751 --> 14:22.040
After-work drinks?

14:23.618 --> 14:25.446
I'm sorry.
It's just...

14:25.616 --> 14:27.296
I see.
You're dumping me.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.464
I've really enjoyed spending time
with you,

14:31.589 --> 14:33.929
and I don't deserve
this much pleasure.

14:34.054 --> 14:36.708
I know, I'm messed up.
I'm just a big ol'bucket of crazy.

14:37.065 --> 14:39.942
But I thought again,
because of my own inadequacies.

14:40.067 --> 14:41.505
We should take a little break.

14:43.057 --> 14:45.718
Isn't that funny? Because
I've been wanting to take a break, too.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.553
So this works out perfectly.
Good bye.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.726
You want to take a break
from medieval fight club?

14:54.895 --> 14:58.187
But don't you want to see my new tunic?
It's got clovers on it.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.523
You bought a tunic?

15:00.399 --> 15:03.477
That's a big investment, considering
you're gonna stop when Rose gets home.

15:03.695 --> 15:05.846
That's right. You're going to stop
when Rose gets home.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.891
No way. I am hooked.

15:08.286 --> 15:10.141
I'll just get a sitter
a couple nights a week.

15:10.266 --> 15:12.577
But it's not gonna be the same
without my two court jesters.

15:12.975 --> 15:16.393
The thing is, we've been under
a lot of pressure

15:16.518 --> 15:18.686
from the model train club
to get back into that.

15:19.037 --> 15:22.667
I have a chance at being
the first black mayor of tiny town...

15:27.249 --> 15:30.554
I guess I can't force you
to keep coming to fight club.

15:32.650 --> 15:34.888
By the way, I'm gonna need
to see the specs

15:35.013 --> 15:37.936
on the taste-altering brain implant
on my desk by 9:00 a. M.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.308
- No way.
- We can't have it done that quickly.

15:41.471 --> 15:43.775
It looks like
you're gonna be up all night.

15:44.815 --> 15:45.765
Although,

15:46.446 --> 15:48.876
If you had a good enough reason
to not be working,

15:49.001 --> 15:50.824
I suppose it could wait a few days.

15:51.886 --> 15:55.495
Would medieval fight club
be a good enough reason?

15:55.880 --> 15:58.695
That's what I want to hear.
Come on, guys, it's gonna be fun.

15:58.820 --> 16:00.417
Be there or be squire.

16:04.777 --> 16:06.491
"Be there or besquire."

16:06.907 --> 16:09.548
- I said that two years ago.
- You were right.

16:09.673 --> 16:12.100
His true boss nature
came through and attacked.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.054
We have to figure out a way
to get Ted to drop out of fight club.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.155
But how?

16:17.724 --> 16:20.019
What if we pit him
against The Groth?

16:20.188 --> 16:21.187
The Groth?

16:24.941 --> 16:27.626
I guess it was put
on this earth for a reason.

16:33.631 --> 16:35.160
I don't think so, fellas.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.181
I'm done with medieval fight club.
I have a girlfriend now.

16:39.306 --> 16:42.668
It's just this one time.
Please, The Groth?

16:43.021 --> 16:43.871
For us?

16:47.057 --> 16:50.675
<i>It turned out Veronica
didn't like taking a friendship break.</i>

16:51.198 --> 16:52.098
Hold it!

16:53.403 --> 16:55.435
<i>And since Veronica was the boss,</i>

16:55.560 --> 16:57.958
<i>she had lots of ways
to make that clear.</i>

16:59.966 --> 17:02.899
There you go, Joe.
Enjoy your extra room.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.950
Bring him to me!

17:23.291 --> 17:26.167
You okay?You look a little nervous.
You can call it off and never come back.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.430
I just got off the phone with Rose.

17:28.555 --> 17:30.745
She's gonna stay a few more days
in New York with her mom,

17:30.870 --> 17:34.641
who didn't clear it with me first,
so now if I say "no," I'm the bad guy.

17:35.212 --> 17:37.897
But... Stuff happens.
No biggie.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.058
Who dares challenge?

17:57.179 --> 17:58.724
I feel like you've been wanting

17:58.849 --> 18:01.078
to get our relationship back
to the way it was.

18:01.669 --> 18:05.250
What gave you that idea? That you turned
my cubicle into a hobbit hole?

18:05.418 --> 18:07.597
Now let's not get into
"who shrunk whose office"

18:07.722 --> 18:09.587
or "who canceled whose dental plan."

18:10.060 --> 18:12.430
The point is,
we had something special,

18:12.555 --> 18:14.470
and you'd like to get back to that.

18:14.595 --> 18:15.715
And I accept.

18:16.924 --> 18:21.280
I'd like to, but real friends don't talk
about their problems all the time.

18:21.405 --> 18:23.267
Real friends listen to each other.

18:26.391 --> 18:27.791
I'm listening now.

18:30.414 --> 18:31.514
Let's see...

18:32.187 --> 18:33.537
Here's something.

18:33.817 --> 18:36.340
When I was growing up,
I wanted to be a gymnast,

18:36.465 --> 18:38.739
and every night,
after my parents went to sleep,

18:38.864 --> 18:40.945
I used to sneak out of bed
and put on my leotard.

18:41.070 --> 18:43.645
And one night, when I thought
my parents were sleeping,

18:43.770 --> 18:45.404
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to stop you.

18:45.529 --> 18:47.541
You going on and on
about yourself...

18:47.710 --> 18:48.810
It feels...

18:49.743 --> 18:50.590
needy.

18:51.147 --> 18:51.958
Needy?

18:54.175 --> 18:56.571
I tell you one thing
that happened to me.

18:56.696 --> 18:58.218
One thing important in my life.

18:58.390 --> 19:01.139
You're doing it again.
And I find it off-putting.

19:02.672 --> 19:05.769
I'm sorry. I can't be friends
with you anymore.

19:07.188 --> 19:08.448
You've changed.

19:15.790 --> 19:17.274
It's okay.
I got it.

19:17.909 --> 19:18.909
I'm sorry.

19:19.933 --> 19:21.451
I'm a little preoccupied.

19:23.446 --> 19:25.659
I almost killed a man
in the basement.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.215
Last week, a story like that
would've surprised me.

19:28.340 --> 19:31.774
So who'd you almost kill? Was it Joe?
I hate that guy he took half my cubicle.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.000
I've been doing
this medieval fight club

19:34.125 --> 19:35.823
since Rose has been with her mom,

19:35.948 --> 19:38.718
- and I got a little carried away.
- Your ex-wife's in town?

19:39.214 --> 19:41.548
She blew into New York
for a couple weeks.

19:41.673 --> 19:45.141
Since she's never here, I have to drop
everything so that Rose can be with her.

19:45.806 --> 19:48.179
When Rose gets back,
she wants to stay up late,

19:48.304 --> 19:50.858
have ice cream for breakfast,
and then I don't let her

19:50.983 --> 19:53.087
because I'm an actual parent,
not Willy Wonka.

19:53.212 --> 19:56.030
I'm the bad guy.
Rose gets mad at me and...

19:56.340 --> 19:59.415
- I'm going back to the basement.
- Why? Is your ex-wife down there?

20:00.868 --> 20:01.615
What?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.035
It sounds like that's
who you've been fighting all week.

20:06.217 --> 20:09.130
Either that, or you've turned
into some gigantic nerd.

20:10.706 --> 20:13.404
First of all, you are speaking
to a knight of the realm,

20:13.529 --> 20:15.079
so show some respect.

20:16.272 --> 20:18.173
Second of all, you might be right.

20:19.569 --> 20:22.344
There's a single dads'club that meets
on the fifth floor every week.

20:22.469 --> 20:24.094
Maybe you should check it out.

20:24.574 --> 20:26.933
I guess I could go beat up
some single dads.

20:27.747 --> 20:29.060
I see what you're saying.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.813
You're smart. And the basement ***

20:32.451 --> 20:34.681
Actually they *** water.
It's more like a...

20:34.806 --> 20:36.526
medival wet t-shirt contest.

20:38.371 --> 20:41.294
Good news. We took a vote.
And made you, the new King.

20:41.419 --> 20:43.865
And we took an other vote
and you're died.

20:43.990 --> 20:45.535
Gloriously in battle.

20:46.022 --> 20:48.453
Listen fellas, I own you a apollogy

20:48.578 --> 20:51.666
I've been working out on personal stuff.
And I acted like a jerk.

20:53.544 --> 20:55.003
I hope I can make up to you.

20:58.197 --> 20:59.757
Rest in peace, King Ted.

21:01.302 --> 21:04.262
He means, you're dead
so don't come back.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.431
- I got it.
- ***

21:09.401 --> 21:11.528
At least,
you two got an apollogy from your boss.

21:11.653 --> 21:14.355
All I got from Veronica was a ***
