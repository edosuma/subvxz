02:42.896 --> 02:46.332
The NTSB guys are here
about that bulkhead problem.

02:46.366 --> 02:47.697
OK, thanks.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.210
It's there.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.953
I should run the algorithms,
though, don't you think?

03:47.994 --> 03:50.019
Nope.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.497
You wanna wait for those
spectrometer results?

03:52.532 --> 03:53.692
No.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.382
Hi.

04:21.427 --> 04:22.416
Hey.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.229
What about dinner, tonight?

04:27.267 --> 04:30.703
Ha. We go out to dinner...

04:30.737 --> 04:33.535
we might never come back.

04:33.573 --> 04:34.562
OK.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.835
Hee hee!

04:38.278 --> 04:41.076
I wanna wake up with you...

04:41.114 --> 04:42.775
Mrs. Smith.

04:44.784 --> 04:48.345
I want to at least see where you live.

04:51.724 --> 04:55.091
I live here...

04:55.128 --> 04:57.028
Mr. Smith.

05:29.395 --> 05:30.384
Metro division.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.159
Uh, Lieutenant Nunally, please.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.031
Uh, Lieutenant Nunally
comes on at 6:00 tonight.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.092
Can someone else help you?

05:36.135 --> 05:38.262
No, that's OK, I'll see him later.

05:38.304 --> 05:39.293
Thank you.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.090
Whoa!

06:03.763 --> 06:05.492
Ha!

06:48.574 --> 06:50.667
Hey.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.034
Afternoon, Ciro.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.670
- Hello there.
- Ahh.

08:30.476 --> 08:32.467
You're home early.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.809
Yeah.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.544
I just felt, um...

08:40.586 --> 08:42.986
a sudden urge.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.353
Are you OK?

08:46.425 --> 08:48.484
Ah... Yeah.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.996
I could use a hug.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.019
Hmm.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.835
You know,
I've been watching you sleep...

08:56.869 --> 08:59.167
at night.

09:02.008 --> 09:03.202
That's creepy.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.176
Huh. Yeah.

09:05.211 --> 09:06.644
Yeah, sometimes when I'm at work...

09:06.679 --> 09:08.112
I'll start thinking about you...

09:08.147 --> 09:09.637
and I'll just get...

09:09.682 --> 09:12.276
Ahh, just overwhelmed.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.410
Ted...

09:13.452 --> 09:14.680
It's a dense, crushing...

09:14.720 --> 09:17.848
geophysical force,
like I'm pinned to the core...

09:17.890 --> 09:20.222
while things change, you know?

09:21.861 --> 09:24.921
Do you ever get
that way about me, Jen?

09:24.964 --> 09:27.592
I really don't think I can do
one of these tonight.

09:27.633 --> 09:28.895
I'm just... huh...

09:28.935 --> 09:30.732
trying to describe my feelings.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.260
Those don't sound like feelings.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.239
Oh.

09:34.273 --> 09:37.265
What's the sound of a feeling?

09:39.612 --> 09:42.137
You think you're
so much smarter than me.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.547
Must make you feel very powerful.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.449
Helpless, actually.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.747
OK, maybe it's time to really talk.

09:49.789 --> 09:50.778
No.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.586
- No?
- No.

09:52.625 --> 09:53.751
Fine.

09:53.793 --> 09:54.782
Whatever.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.260
Huh.

09:56.295 --> 09:58.126
I'll go change.
I'll make some dinner.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.934
I love you.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.798
I know.

10:12.478 --> 10:14.378
Does he...

10:15.381 --> 10:16.473
Mrs. Smith?

10:20.987 --> 10:21.976
I'm sorry.

10:22.021 --> 10:24.285
Don't be.

10:24.323 --> 10:25.790
Knowledge is pain.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.452
I'm used to that.

10:27.493 --> 10:30.656
Not that I don't get
some little pleasures...

10:30.696 --> 10:32.425
in return for the pain, mind you.

11:08.868 --> 11:10.028
Mr. And Mrs. Crawford?

11:11.070 --> 11:12.059
You all right?

11:13.606 --> 11:15.540
Everybody OK in there?

12:36.455 --> 12:38.013
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary?

12:38.057 --> 12:40.287
Did you see anything unusual?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.315
Mr. And Mrs. Crawford.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.725
Nobody else?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.786
No. No.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.830
Flores, how you been?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.858
Good, good, you know, same.

12:49.902 --> 12:52.166
We've got one witness,
maybe, uh, the gardener.

12:52.204 --> 12:53.262
His name's Ciro.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.773
Hey, guys, this is Lieutenant Nunally.

12:55.808 --> 12:56.797
Good to meet you.

12:56.842 --> 12:57.831
Hello, sir.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.071
So what do we know?

13:08.487 --> 13:10.512
Mr. Crawford?

13:10.556 --> 13:11.750
Who is this?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.418
My name is Lieutenant
Robert Nunally.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.256
I'm a hostage negotiator
with the L.A.P.D.

13:16.395 --> 13:17.953
Mr. Crawford?

13:25.004 --> 13:26.835
OK.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.003
You two, let's go.

13:42.254 --> 13:43.949
Just you, please.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.431
Mr. Crawford?

13:59.872 --> 14:01.100
I'm just gonna...

14:01.140 --> 14:03.199
slide the door open
just a bit, all right?

14:07.346 --> 14:08.335
Hi.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.143
Hi.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.174
Do I call you Rob?

14:14.386 --> 14:16.320
Sure, yeah. If you want to.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.888
Lots of vampires out there.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.028
Mr. Crawford...

14:24.063 --> 14:25.428
what do you say
you gimme the gun?

14:25.464 --> 14:27.489
That way I can pay more
attention to what you're saying.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.522
All right?

14:30.402 --> 14:33.860
Is that your best shot... Rob?

14:33.906 --> 14:35.931
So to speak.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.772
Tell you what. I will if you will.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.440
We both put down our guns.

14:42.481 --> 14:46.212
We set them down
and we step away.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.812
Then you can pay attention
to what I'm saying.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.551
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you...

14:52.591 --> 14:54.286
to put yours down first, then.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.588
Then you have my word.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.754
Everybody gives a little...

14:56.795 --> 14:57.887
we'll see what we can do...

14:57.930 --> 14:59.727
about getting you
what you want, OK?

14:59.765 --> 15:01.460
Happy ending, then.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.747
So Mr. Crawford, your gardener tells it
that... that your wife...

15:16.782 --> 15:18.306
It's Ted.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.715
I'm sorry.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.448
You can call me Ted.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.786
Ted. Great.

15:24.823 --> 15:25.812
Ted.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.151
Your wife, is she here?

15:35.467 --> 15:36.764
Is she all right?

15:36.802 --> 15:39.498
I don't think she is.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.800
I shot her.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.271
You shot your wife.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.903
It's just like I suddenly snapped...

15:45.945 --> 15:50.712
and I got the gun and
I shot her in the head.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.080
I know it was wrong.

16:00.492 --> 16:02.926
Are you listening to me, Rob?

16:05.197 --> 16:06.494
Uh... Jesus Christ.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.494
You know, I read somewhere
that the best place...

16:09.535 --> 16:11.969
to find a pulse
is in the femoral artery.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.598
It's on the inner surface
of the upper thigh.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.403
So if you just, uh, put your fingers...

16:16.442 --> 16:17.466
up her skirt...

16:17.509 --> 16:19.477
you'll find it.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.008
Go! Go!

16:26.652 --> 16:27.676
Break it up!

16:28.721 --> 16:29.881
We got a victim down!

16:35.861 --> 16:37.328
She's got a pulse.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.000
Rob.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.510
Good job.

16:52.544 --> 16:53.738
You all right?

17:45.130 --> 17:47.064
I wanna be in the room.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.589
Well, we got it covered.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.433
Yeah, I know.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.929
I just wanna be there.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.506
And I want this thing locked...

17:59.545 --> 18:01.604
before we pass it to the D.A.

18:58.370 --> 18:59.769
Stop yelling, Phil.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.432
I called you as a courtesy...

19:01.473 --> 19:02.963
and now you're trying
to take advantage.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.805
I'm not.

19:04.843 --> 19:06.640
I'm not knocking
it down to a class C.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.010
My backlog of open cases
doesn't mitigate the fact...

19:09.047 --> 19:11.845
that your client tried
to kill his brother-in-law.

19:13.185 --> 19:14.652
A golfing accident.

19:14.686 --> 19:17.849
Phil, your client
owns one golf club...

19:17.890 --> 19:19.187
no golf balls...

19:19.224 --> 19:21.021
and the accident
happened in a stairwell...

19:21.059 --> 19:25.018
of an after-hours,
illegal gambling hall.

19:27.466 --> 19:29.661
Uhh. I'll see you in court.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.004
Well, I won't.
Someone from this office will.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.528
You can take it up with them.

19:39.478 --> 19:40.536
Beachum.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.145
Hello.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.673
Ahem.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.413
No, I didn't.

19:48.453 --> 19:49.545
Yeah.

19:49.588 --> 19:51.522
Wooton Sims?

19:51.557 --> 19:52.581
Shh.

19:52.624 --> 19:53.921
Wooton Sims?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.119
Shut up.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.650
Short notice is fine.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.663
It's fine. Uh-huh.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.097
Black tie? Fine.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.191
What time?

20:02.234 --> 20:03.258
That'll be fine.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.792
Thank her for me.

20:04.836 --> 20:06.064
All right.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.832
How many times did I just say fine?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.502
You asshole!

20:11.543 --> 20:14.034
How the hell did you get
a job at Wooton Sims?

20:14.079 --> 20:15.376
I can't even get an interview!

20:15.414 --> 20:16.472
We're gonna just
pretend he's not talking.

20:16.515 --> 20:17.504
I've been here five years, Willy.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.538
I'm your supervisor.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.211
I graduated USC, summa.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.186
- I need a tuxedo.
- A tux?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.518
You are so full of shit.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.318
A tuxedo tonight. Is that possible?

20:25.357 --> 20:26.346
Of course.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.380
- They do that?
- Uh-huh.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.723
- Same day sort of thing?
- Sure.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.954
- Can I give you that?
- Yeah.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.053
OK.

20:31.096 --> 20:32.222
Well, that's maxed out...

20:32.264 --> 20:33.561
so I'm gonna give you this, then.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.499
So, um, what's this all about?

20:35.534 --> 20:37.331
Well, you know,
Burt Wooton's having...

20:37.369 --> 20:38.734
a charity opera thing, and, uh...

20:38.770 --> 20:39.862
Burt?

20:39.905 --> 20:41.395
Well, that's what
he told me to call him.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.533
You're gonna need
to pick out a style, Willy.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.304
- Well, like what?
- Willy Beachum's office.

20:45.344 --> 20:46.402
Thinking maybe, uh...

20:46.445 --> 20:47.571
- Classic.
- Classic.

20:47.613 --> 20:48.602
Yeah, no problem.

20:48.647 --> 20:49.909
- Classic.
- Uh-huh.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.939
Just makes sure it comes with cuff links
and knee pads.

20:51.984 --> 20:52.973
- Willy.
- Ahh.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.007
That's not classic.

20:54.052 --> 20:55.041
That's what I'm saying.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.076
Before. After.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.088
That's the way I go.

20:57.122 --> 20:58.953
God wants to see you.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.414
Our god?

21:01.460 --> 21:04.190
Who art on the fourth floor.

21:07.799 --> 21:08.788
Mr. Lobruto?

21:08.834 --> 21:09.892
Mr. Beachum.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.435
Have a seat.

21:13.472 --> 21:14.461
Thank you.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.472
William "no middle initial" Beachum.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.745
Wow, a 97% conviction rate.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.114
That's impressive.

21:26.151 --> 21:27.778
Thank you, sir.

21:27.819 --> 21:32.449
'Course, you traded all your losing cases
to other D.D.A.s.

21:32.491 --> 21:35.085
Well, uh...

21:35.127 --> 21:38.563
I took on two or three cases
for every one I gave away.

21:38.597 --> 21:40.724
They just couldn't
handle their caseloads...

21:40.766 --> 21:42.131
and I don't like to lose.

21:42.167 --> 21:45.000
Uh, you won't always
win working at Wooton Sims.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.129
Ahem.

21:46.171 --> 21:48.298
Working at Wooton Sims
sort of is winning.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.807
Isn't it?

21:49.841 --> 21:51.832
Well, you'll need a middle initial.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.342
Sir?

21:54.379 --> 21:56.847
Well, those guys all play squash
and have middle names.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.645
Ahh. Huh.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.379
They go in for their mother's
maiden name a lot.

22:00.419 --> 22:03.479
Well, my mother doesn't
have a maiden name.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.548
I think you belong here, William.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.653
Well, with all due respect, sir...

22:09.695 --> 22:12.129
I just didn't work this hard
to stay where I belong.

22:13.398 --> 22:16.367
Yeah, well... I didn't think so.

22:19.204 --> 22:21.934
Well, you have your litigation experience...

22:21.973 --> 22:23.372
your chops...

22:24.543 --> 22:27.671
and your, uh,
juicy private sector job.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.307
Pretty soon you'll be
courtside at Laker games.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.840
Anything else the city of
Los Angeles can do for ya?

22:32.884 --> 22:34.647
No, sir. I think that'll be all.

22:34.686 --> 22:35.675
Yeah.

22:35.721 --> 22:38.212
It's a cummerbund, Willy.

22:38.256 --> 22:41.419
Huh. That's gonna go
around your waist, OK?

22:41.460 --> 22:42.484
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.516
- Are we good?
- Uh-huh.

22:43.562 --> 22:44.586
- Good.
- All right.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.559
Willy?

22:53.572 --> 22:54.971
Willy, come on.
Pick up the phone.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.871
Uh...

22:56.908 --> 22:58.432
What, Norman?

22:58.477 --> 22:59.705
Got an attempted homicide.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.838
Guy shot his wife, she's in a coma.

23:01.880 --> 23:05.816
Arraignment's at 3:00
with Judge Moran.

23:05.851 --> 23:07.250
3:00 is in 15 minutes.

23:07.285 --> 23:10.550
You do still actually
work here, Willy. Right?

23:10.589 --> 23:12.557
Norman, would you just find
somebody else to do it?

23:12.591 --> 23:14.855
Everybody's booked.
Look, it's not going to trial.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.520
There's a weapon with prints...

23:16.561 --> 23:18.188
and a signed confession.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.131
Just take the arraignment,
wait for the plea.

23:22.267 --> 23:23.996
It's a real confession?

23:24.035 --> 23:26.560
Spontaneous and signed.

23:26.605 --> 23:28.072
Come on, Willy.

23:28.106 --> 23:31.473
All right, but, uh...

23:31.510 --> 23:32.499
here's the problem.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.646
OK, that'll do!
I've given my ruling.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.739
If they want to squabble,
they can take it outside.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.114
I apologize, Your Honor.

23:39.151 --> 23:40.379
Your Honor, please.
Your Honor.

23:51.363 --> 23:52.421
Mr. Beachum.

23:52.464 --> 23:55.433
Nice to see a man
who dresses for court.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.833
I'm very sorry, Your Honor.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.461
Very sorry.

23:59.504 --> 24:01.438
It's a long story.

24:01.473 --> 24:03.600
The people of the
state of California...

24:03.642 --> 24:05.667
versus Theodore Crawford.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.611
Your Honor, the public
defender is representing...

24:09.648 --> 24:10.842
Mr. Crawford
for his arraignment...

24:10.882 --> 24:13.248
with the understanding
that he will secure...

24:13.285 --> 24:15.480
private counsel
for all further proceedings.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.681
Mr. Crawford,
you have been charged...

24:17.722 --> 24:20.748
with section 664 slash 187...

24:20.792 --> 24:23.454
of the California penal
code: Attempted murder.

24:23.495 --> 24:26.157
Do you waive further
reading of the complaint...

24:26.198 --> 24:27.665
and complete statement
of rights?

24:27.699 --> 24:28.893
You do.

24:28.934 --> 24:29.992
I do. But, l... I want...

24:30.035 --> 24:32.196
And do you wish to enter
a plea at this time?

24:32.237 --> 24:33.295
Yes, not guilty.

24:33.338 --> 24:34.327
But I also want to waive my right...

24:34.372 --> 24:36.567
to a counsel and represent myself.

24:36.608 --> 24:38.667
Surely you won't have trouble finding...

24:38.710 --> 24:40.541
an attorney, Mr. Crawford?

24:40.579 --> 24:42.103
No, but I want to do it myself.

24:42.147 --> 24:44.012
Your Honor, if I can have
a moment with my client.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.141
I'm not your client.

24:45.183 --> 24:46.309
Try and keep up, will you?

24:46.351 --> 24:48.012
Uh, Mr. Crawford, uh...

24:48.053 --> 24:50.521
you're facing some
very serious charges here.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.785
I strongly urge you to retain counsel.

24:52.824 --> 24:53.813
That's very kind...

24:53.859 --> 24:55.554
but I believe I'm within my rights.

24:55.594 --> 24:57.459
Be aware that lack of counsel...

24:57.496 --> 24:59.020
will not be grounds for an appeal.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.157
Oh, I understand. I understand.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.690
People have an objection,
Mr. Beachum?

25:05.871 --> 25:06.997
Well, Your Honor...

25:07.038 --> 25:08.835
we have a...

25:08.874 --> 25:10.535
a verbal and signed confession.

25:12.077 --> 25:14.637
So, I would strongly advise...

25:14.679 --> 25:17.239
Mr. Crawford to, uh...

25:19.718 --> 25:22.881
to get a competent attorney
to try and negotiate a plea.

25:22.921 --> 25:24.548
That's pretty damning
evidence, Mr. Crawford.

25:24.589 --> 25:25.681
You wanna reconsider?

25:25.724 --> 25:27.123
Absolutely not.

25:27.158 --> 25:28.989
Huh. It's gonna turn into a circus.

25:29.027 --> 25:30.255
I appreciate your concern...

25:30.295 --> 25:32.024
for the dignity of the court, 007.

25:32.063 --> 25:35.294
Unfortunately, the man
is a tax-paying citizen...

25:35.333 --> 25:36.800
and entitled
by our constitution...

25:36.835 --> 25:38.598
to try and manipulate
the legal system...

25:38.637 --> 25:39.797
like everybody else.

25:39.838 --> 25:42.068
Mr. Crawford wants to go pro per...

25:43.575 --> 25:45.600
that's gonna take a while, and sadly...

25:45.644 --> 25:47.202
I won't be here for it.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.543
But the people have no objection.

25:49.581 --> 25:52.209
Your Honor, I'd, uh, like to, um...

25:52.250 --> 25:54.184
waive my right to preliminary hearing...

25:54.219 --> 25:55.914
and go direct to trial
as soon as possible.

25:55.954 --> 25:58.445
Uh, does that help you,
Mr., uh, Beachum?

25:58.490 --> 25:59.548
Y... You don't have to worry...

25:59.591 --> 26:00.819
about Mr. Beachum, Mr. Crawford.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.349
The district attorney's office...

26:02.394 --> 26:03.861
will assign another prosecutor.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.123
No, I like Mr. Beachum.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.223
Mr. Beachum.

26:09.634 --> 26:11.568
He likes you.

26:13.471 --> 26:14.460
Yes.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.201
That's terrific.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.004
Appears Mr. Crawford
has an understanding...

26:19.044 --> 26:21.239
of his rights and responsibilities, so...

26:21.279 --> 26:23.474
it's your call, Mr. Beachum.

26:32.457 --> 26:33.583
Why not?

26:33.625 --> 26:35.320
All right, then.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.794
Case will move to trial
at the first available date.

26:47.672 --> 26:48.661
Beachum.

26:52.477 --> 26:53.808
You're supposed to be good.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.481
Is that right?

27:01.086 --> 27:02.951
Who the hell are you?

27:02.988 --> 27:05.616
I'm, uh, Lieutenant Nunally.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.955
I took Crawford's confession.

27:07.993 --> 27:09.324
Oh.

27:11.096 --> 27:13.656
Shoo. OK.

27:13.698 --> 27:15.859
So, what can I do for ya?

27:18.169 --> 27:20.831
Are you gonna be on this, or what?

27:22.007 --> 27:23.338
'Cause it looks to me like...

27:23.375 --> 27:25.002
you got one foot out
the door already.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.174
Oh.

27:30.181 --> 27:31.808
Huh.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.148
You should be taking this seriously.

27:34.185 --> 27:36.312
You know, be careful
with this guy. He's... he's...

27:36.354 --> 27:37.651
There's something not right about him.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.217
Y... Y... You took
the confession, right?

27:42.594 --> 27:44.084
You took the gun out of his hand.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.118
Yeah.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.687
Great. So it's done.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.898
Don't worry about it.

28:08.219 --> 28:09.516
Can I have a bourbon?

28:09.554 --> 28:11.249
Yes, sir.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.586
Thank you.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.751
Are you a shark?

28:19.431 --> 28:20.693
Excuse me?

28:20.732 --> 28:22.359
You've been circling this lobby...

28:22.400 --> 28:24.027
for half an hour now...

28:24.069 --> 28:26.037
like if you'd stopped, you'd die.

28:26.071 --> 28:27.299
Oh. Yeah...

28:27.338 --> 28:28.430
I'm a shark.

28:30.008 --> 28:32.408
What about you?
Are you a shark, too?

28:33.645 --> 28:36.113
You say hi to Burt?

28:36.147 --> 28:37.512
Oh.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.517
Burt's talking to the mayor.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.984
Do I know you?

28:41.019 --> 28:45.115
Nikki Gardner. Your new boss.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.817
Oh.

28:46.858 --> 28:48.052
Ha.

28:48.093 --> 28:49.583
You're the one who
sent me the invitation?

28:49.627 --> 28:50.889
Well, I thought I ought
to get to know...

28:50.929 --> 28:54.592
the mystery man that Burt
plucked outta nowhere.

28:57.635 --> 29:00.399
Well, I don't really know Burt.

29:07.679 --> 29:12.139
So, every partner has a team
of senior associates.

29:12.183 --> 29:15.516
Every senior associate has
a team of junior associates.

29:15.553 --> 29:18.750
And you're on my team,
which means I'll supervise...

29:18.790 --> 29:20.257
your casework
and I'll steer you...

29:20.291 --> 29:22.088
through the office politics.

29:22.127 --> 29:24.152
Kinda like a mentor.

29:24.195 --> 29:26.561
Kinda like a probation officer.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.863
Oh, you trying...
you're trying to scare me?

29:31.369 --> 29:33.098
Let me ask you a question.

29:33.138 --> 29:34.605
OK.

29:34.639 --> 29:36.106
Shoot.

29:36.141 --> 29:37.768
We have a senior associate...

29:37.809 --> 29:39.606
at the firm named Calvin Tyler.

29:39.644 --> 29:42.078
Kind of a rising star.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.842
He goes into court against you.

29:43.882 --> 29:45.440
Some client's kid is D.U. I...

29:45.483 --> 29:47.781
And the next thing we know,
Calvin is fired and...

29:47.819 --> 29:50.151
Burt Wooton, who has
never even interviewed...

29:50.188 --> 29:52.748
a junior associate before,
let alone hired one...

29:52.791 --> 29:54.816
says you're starting in two weeks.

29:57.228 --> 30:00.288
Calvin came to me for a deal.

30:00.331 --> 30:02.265
So I told him if he
can get me a meeting...

30:02.300 --> 30:03.995
with Mr. Wooton, that I'd...

30:05.670 --> 30:07.331
throw the case.

30:07.372 --> 30:10.535
He set it up, but he came
to court unprepared...

30:10.575 --> 30:12.907
and I mopped the floor with him.

30:12.944 --> 30:15.276
Your client got
the maximum, and then...

30:15.313 --> 30:17.873
next day, I was meeting
with Mr. Wooton.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.747
Bo... Burt.

30:22.754 --> 30:25.154
That's...

30:25.190 --> 30:27.886
You didn't actually do
anything all that wrong.

30:27.926 --> 30:30.053
I wasn't exactly honest with Calvin.

30:30.094 --> 30:31.083
Ha.

30:35.066 --> 30:36.533
Are you gonna get that?

30:40.772 --> 30:43.639
Everybody I wanna talk
to is right here.

30:47.212 --> 30:48.839
Welcome to Wooton Sims.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.006
Get your phone.

30:52.884 --> 30:54.010
Yeah.

30:54.052 --> 30:57.044
Hey, Willy, it's Flores.
I got bad news.

30:57.088 --> 30:59.181
The gun. It's no good.

30:59.224 --> 31:01.556
What do you mean
the gun's no good?

31:01.593 --> 31:03.584
Well, it's a fine gun.

31:03.628 --> 31:05.892
It's just no good as evidence.

31:05.930 --> 31:06.954
Never been fired.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.397
Never been fired?

31:08.433 --> 31:10.867
Well, it's the gun
from the house, isn't it?

31:10.902 --> 31:12.426
Yeah. It's, uh...

31:12.470 --> 31:14.028
property of the defendant...

31:14.072 --> 31:17.872
bought about... one month ago.

31:17.909 --> 31:19.934
Well, the gun never left the house.

31:19.978 --> 31:22.469
He was locked inside
from the time of the crime...

31:22.513 --> 31:24.845
to the time of the arrest.

31:24.883 --> 31:27.545
So the gun is in there.

31:27.585 --> 31:30.110
So don't tell me that
the gun isn't in there.

31:30.154 --> 31:31.382
Go find it.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.413
Get a team out there tomorrow
and find it.

32:36.454 --> 32:37.443
No, I haven't.

32:37.488 --> 32:38.785
I have not.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.916
Well, everything's been
so expedited, you know.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.427
And I guess I just thought that, uh...

32:43.461 --> 32:45.452
Well, I don't know.
I guess I thought...

32:45.496 --> 32:47.862
however it was decorated
was how it was decorated.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.457
Huh?

32:49.500 --> 32:50.626
Right away, sir.

32:50.668 --> 32:51.965
Well, what do most...

32:52.003 --> 32:53.834
of the other junior associates have?

32:55.907 --> 32:57.670
Oh.

32:57.709 --> 32:58.835
Well, what...

32:58.876 --> 33:00.810
What is the difference between, uh...

33:00.845 --> 33:03.507
Italian and English?

33:06.250 --> 33:07.308
Yeah, I kno...

33:07.352 --> 33:08.819
I know that they are
two different countries.

33:08.853 --> 33:10.980
I was talking about in
terms of interior design.

33:11.022 --> 33:13.149
You hold on one second?

33:13.191 --> 33:14.988
Huh.

33:15.026 --> 33:18.189
What, uh, kind of style
would you say that this is?

33:18.229 --> 33:19.696
Homicidal modern?

33:23.201 --> 33:24.361
I don't know.

33:24.402 --> 33:26.768
I guess I'll just know it when I see it.

33:26.804 --> 33:28.032
Uh-huh.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.937
Ooh, 2:00? I don't...

33:35.346 --> 33:36.836
Yeah, all right. I can do it.

33:36.881 --> 33:37.973
Bye-bye, now.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.176
Alright, good to see you.

33:40.051 --> 33:41.484
What the hell is this?

33:41.519 --> 33:44.420
It's a... thing.

33:44.455 --> 33:45.888
It does stuff.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.084
What, did he make it or something?

33:48.126 --> 33:50.151
- The guy? Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.218
Here, take a look at this.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.196
It's for the Glock 45...

33:53.231 --> 33:54.425
we found at the scene.

33:54.465 --> 33:58.663
Now, we got no other
sign of a gun so far.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.034
No weapon.

34:00.071 --> 34:01.971
No powder on his hand...

34:02.006 --> 34:03.530
no blood on his clothes.

34:03.574 --> 34:04.871
We found four shell casings.

34:04.909 --> 34:06.604
45's wiped clean. No prints.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.339
That's four shots fired.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.643
Four bullets missing from the case.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.149
Four shell casings on the
floor with no prints on 'em.

34:13.184 --> 34:16.051
And a gun that's never been fired.

34:16.087 --> 34:18.179
The guy's screwing with us.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.087
He's stacking the deck.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.092
She's pretty.

34:25.763 --> 34:29.960
Look, the gun is in this house.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.629
Maybe he was wearing gloves.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.331
Maybe he had time to change.

34:35.373 --> 34:36.567
But it's in the house...

34:36.607 --> 34:38.097
and I'll tell you why
it's in the house.

34:38.141 --> 34:40.132
Because people
were watching the house.

34:40.178 --> 34:41.804
And he never came out.

34:41.846 --> 34:43.108
And I could be wrong...

34:43.147 --> 34:46.081
but I don't think that the gun
grew little gun legs...

34:46.117 --> 34:47.846
and ran out of the house.

34:47.885 --> 34:50.376
So, if you need more guys...

34:50.420 --> 34:52.321
I'm all for it.

35:06.304 --> 35:08.101
That's disability insurance.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.936
- Uh-huh.
- Most of our employees get that.

35:09.974 --> 35:11.601
It's only an additional $6.84 a month.

35:11.642 --> 35:12.836
All right.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.777
Just be sure you sign the one
with the devil in blood.

35:14.812 --> 35:16.507
It's not binding otherwise.

35:17.648 --> 35:18.910
Just going into a meeting.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.110
I wanted to stop by and make sure...

35:20.151 --> 35:21.641
you're getting everything you need.

35:21.686 --> 35:24.154
I'm getting more than I need.

35:27.825 --> 35:29.793
I'm running a little late.
Will you walk with me?

35:29.827 --> 35:31.124
Yeah.

35:31.162 --> 35:32.459
I'll send him right back.

35:32.497 --> 35:33.486
Oh, no problem.

35:33.531 --> 35:34.520
We were just finishing paperwork...

35:34.565 --> 35:35.657
and ordering furniture...

35:35.700 --> 35:37.133
and I was gonna give him
some swatches and chips.

35:37.168 --> 35:38.294
Which I thought
was something to eat...

35:38.336 --> 35:39.428
- didn't I?
- Yeah, you did.

35:39.470 --> 35:40.960
- He he.
- Ha ha ha.

35:41.005 --> 35:42.472
All right.

35:42.507 --> 35:43.496
I like that.

35:43.541 --> 35:44.701
- Oh, I like that one, too.
- Yeah.

35:44.742 --> 35:45.800
No purple.

35:45.843 --> 35:47.970
Let me handle it.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.707
"More than I need," huh?

35:49.747 --> 35:52.944
Oh, I was just talking
about the furniture.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.144
Well, don't get too attached.

35:54.185 --> 35:55.174
You're not gonna be here much.

35:55.219 --> 35:56.811
Two weeks from Tuesday...

35:56.854 --> 35:58.719
whole team's getting
on a plane to Chicago.

35:58.756 --> 36:00.656
Why, what's going on in Chicago?

36:00.691 --> 36:01.885
Warfield.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.322
Warfield?

36:04.362 --> 36:06.091
Ain't that the biotech guy
who stole like, uh...

36:06.130 --> 36:07.961
300 million
from his own company?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.763
That biotech guy who had
no idea whatsoever...

36:10.801 --> 36:12.792
what his CFO was doing?

36:12.837 --> 36:14.532
Oh, right.

36:15.706 --> 36:18.106
This is a test, Willy.

36:18.142 --> 36:20.975
Burt told me to give
you a trial by fire.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.776
I'm good at trials by fire.

36:23.814 --> 36:25.543
He wants you up to speed...

36:25.583 --> 36:27.642
on eight months of
depositions in two weeks.

36:27.685 --> 36:28.674
No problem.

36:28.719 --> 36:31.688
What about closing out your old job?

36:31.722 --> 36:33.053
Don't worry about it.

36:50.174 --> 36:52.199
- Yeah?
- Beachum.

36:52.243 --> 36:53.870
No, Danny, no.

36:53.911 --> 36:55.538
No, no, no, no.
L... no.

36:55.580 --> 36:57.548
The idea is to get things outta here.

36:57.582 --> 36:59.880
Oh, is that the idea?

36:59.917 --> 37:01.248
Well, sorry.

37:03.254 --> 37:04.448
Enjoy a jelly bean.

37:04.488 --> 37:05.580
Hmm. Thanks.

37:07.091 --> 37:08.388
What color did you get?

37:08.426 --> 37:09.552
Yellow.

37:09.594 --> 37:11.721
Oh, that's popcorn. That's gross.

37:11.762 --> 37:12.729
Well, thanks.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.560
Told ya.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.760
Danny, this isn't ev... uhh.

38:07.818 --> 38:09.581
All right.

38:22.099 --> 38:23.964
All right.

38:27.004 --> 38:28.665
Sorry.

38:32.843 --> 38:34.310
How's my wife?

38:34.345 --> 38:36.677
Uh, I don't know.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.182
Sure she's been better, though.

38:40.685 --> 38:42.312
I heard somewhere,
I think it was on NPR...

38:42.353 --> 38:44.480
that you're supposed to talk
to people who are in a coma.

38:44.522 --> 38:45.921
Play their favorite music.

38:45.956 --> 38:48.288
It may help them
or get through to them.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.418
Uh-huh.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.859
But you're probably too busy...

38:50.895 --> 38:54.228
getting up to speed
on the Warfield case, I suppose.

38:59.704 --> 39:00.864
Excuse me?

39:00.905 --> 39:02.736
Hmm?

39:02.773 --> 39:06.709
Oh, no, I'm not...
I'm not judging you, Willy.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.905
No. Anyone coming
from what you came from...

39:08.946 --> 39:11.506
then paying your way through
East Okie cowshit college...

39:11.549 --> 39:13.107
and Tulsa Law by writing papers...

39:13.150 --> 39:15.015
for Princeton kids on the internet...

39:15.052 --> 39:17.486
My God, $60,000 in debt...

39:17.521 --> 39:19.887
and 97% conviction rate.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.858
Wow.

39:21.892 --> 39:23.519
You deserve it, kiddo.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.258
What have you been doing?

39:27.298 --> 39:29.664
Oh, I'm permitted the use
of a private investigator.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.327
Not to investigate me.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.893
Why not? You're investigating me.

39:32.937 --> 39:35.531
Because you shot your wife.

39:35.573 --> 39:38.133
Allegedly. That's how it works, right?

39:38.175 --> 39:40.405
If I can't introduce something
in court as evidence...

39:40.444 --> 39:41.775
it doesn't exist legally.

39:41.812 --> 39:44.906
L... l... I'm not gonna play
games with you.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.214
I'm afraid you have to, old sport.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.181
What is this?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.212
Wha... what is it?

39:53.257 --> 39:54.781
Some kinda, uh,
form of communication?

39:54.825 --> 39:56.690
Uh-huh. You sent me a box of papers.

39:56.727 --> 39:59.059
It's called disc...

39:59.096 --> 40:01.724
It's called discovery, all right?

40:01.766 --> 40:03.927
That's where the state
is legally obligated...

40:03.968 --> 40:05.936
to provide all the evidence...

40:05.970 --> 40:07.028
to the defendant...

40:07.071 --> 40:08.698
so you can prepare your defense.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.570
There's nothing in it, Willy.

40:10.608 --> 40:13.202
You haven't actually
discovered anything.

40:14.445 --> 40:16.470
That's one point of view.

40:16.514 --> 40:19.711
Another might be that
I've hit the mother lode.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.412
Oh, have they found the gun?

40:22.453 --> 40:25.251
I don't need the gun to convict you.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.086
Huh.

40:27.124 --> 40:29.092
Tell me something.

40:29.126 --> 40:31.754
Does it bother you that I call you Willy?

40:31.796 --> 40:33.991
No.

40:34.031 --> 40:36.431
No.

40:36.467 --> 40:37.661
Willy.

40:40.971 --> 40:44.304
Willy, I'd like you to
consider becoming my lawyer.

40:46.310 --> 40:48.005
I'll pay you lots of money.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.637
I'm prosecuting you.

40:51.682 --> 40:53.081
Yes, but I'm giving you a chance...

40:53.117 --> 40:54.914
to get on the other side
of this unholy mess...

40:54.952 --> 40:56.419
while you still can.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.718
Right.

40:58.756 --> 41:00.087
Are you out of your mind?

41:00.124 --> 41:01.284
Ha ha.

41:01.325 --> 41:03.190
I think, on advice of counsel...

41:03.227 --> 41:04.956
I'll decline to answer that one.

41:04.995 --> 41:07.259
All right. Well, look, I'm gonna...

41:07.298 --> 41:08.458
thank you for your offer.

41:08.499 --> 41:10.967
I'm gonna stay right where I am.

41:11.001 --> 41:12.832
At least for one more week.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.701
Look, just keep this.

41:17.741 --> 41:19.072
Don't send it back.

41:19.109 --> 41:20.303
You need that.

41:20.344 --> 41:22.312
You also need to come up
with a witness list.

41:22.346 --> 41:26.077
No, I'll leave all
the witness crap to you.

41:26.116 --> 41:27.811
Right. 'Cause you're not gonna...

41:27.852 --> 41:29.149
You're not gonna call any witnesses.

41:29.186 --> 41:32.314
No, I'm innocent, remember,
until proven guilty.

41:32.356 --> 41:33.687
Whatever.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.123
You heard the judge.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.649
You know that's not
grounds for an appeal.

41:36.694 --> 41:37.820
Ah, what the heck.

41:37.862 --> 41:40.330
Jury of my peers,
and so on and so forth.

41:40.364 --> 41:41.592
Right.

41:43.901 --> 41:47.166
You know, my grandfather
was, uh, an egg farmer.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.364
This isn't gonna be about your, uh...

41:51.408 --> 41:52.500
rough childhood, is it?

41:52.543 --> 41:54.067
No, I used to candle eggs at his farm.

41:54.111 --> 41:55.339
Do you know what that is?

41:55.379 --> 41:57.779
You hold an egg up to the light
of a-a candle and, uh...

41:57.815 --> 41:59.248
you look for imperfections.

41:59.283 --> 42:00.511
The first time I did it...

42:00.551 --> 42:02.178
he told me to put all the eggs
that were cracked...

42:02.219 --> 42:04.551
or flawed into a bucket
for the bakery.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.488
And, uh, he came back
an hour later...

42:06.524 --> 42:08.515
and there were 300 eggs
in the bakery bucket.

42:08.559 --> 42:10.254
He asked me what
the hell I was doing...

42:10.294 --> 42:12.854
but I found a flaw
in every single one of them.

42:12.897 --> 42:16.196
You know, thin places
in the shell and, uh...

42:16.233 --> 42:19.168
fine hairline cracks.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.202
You look closely enough...

42:22.239 --> 42:24.264
you'll find everything
has a weak spot...

42:24.308 --> 42:26.742
where it can break, sooner or later.

42:31.415 --> 42:32.609
You looking for mine?

42:32.650 --> 42:34.618
I've already found yours.

42:34.652 --> 42:36.620
What is it?

42:38.589 --> 42:40.079
You're a winner, Willy.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.222
Heh heh heh.

42:45.262 --> 42:46.889
Yeah.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.455
Well, I guess the joke's
on me, then, isn't it?

42:48.499 --> 42:51.093
You bet your ass, old sport.

43:26.036 --> 43:27.094
What time was that?

43:27.137 --> 43:28.934
About, uh, 5:00.

43:28.973 --> 43:30.304
Then she went into the house.

43:30.341 --> 43:31.535
Prior to that...

43:31.575 --> 43:33.236
had you seen Mr. Crawford
arrive at the house?

43:33.777 --> 43:34.744
Yes.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.803
When was that?

43:36.847 --> 43:38.212
Earlier than usual.

43:38.248 --> 43:40.307
Uh, maybe 4:00.

43:42.653 --> 43:45.087
Did Mr. Crawford park in the carport?

43:45.122 --> 43:47.920
No, he always parks in the garage.

43:47.958 --> 43:50.586
He's very careful with his car.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.027
Would you say that Mr. Crawford...

43:52.062 --> 43:53.791
was a very careful man?

43:53.831 --> 43:55.059
Oh, yes.

43:55.099 --> 43:56.498
Always.

43:59.003 --> 44:00.334
Thank you.

44:02.706 --> 44:04.333
No further questions, Your Honor.

44:08.512 --> 44:09.740
Mr. Crawford.

44:11.048 --> 44:13.107
Uh, yes, Your Honor?

44:17.021 --> 44:19.615
Uh, hello, Ciro.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.562
No, M... Mr. Crawford.

44:26.597 --> 44:30.033
It... It's your turn to
cross-examine this witness.

44:30.067 --> 44:31.159
Oh, no.

44:31.201 --> 44:32.532
No questions.

44:36.974 --> 44:38.066
What time?

44:38.108 --> 44:39.735
5:12 exactly.

44:39.777 --> 44:41.506
We called in SWAT
as soon as we knew...

44:41.545 --> 44:43.274
there was a possible
hostage situation...

44:43.313 --> 44:45.577
and then I tried to establish contact...

44:45.616 --> 44:47.106
through the front gate intercom.

44:47.151 --> 44:48.345
Any answer?

44:48.385 --> 44:50.683
- None.
- What then?

44:50.721 --> 44:52.188
Two other uniform squads arrived.

44:52.222 --> 44:53.951
We established a perimeter...

44:53.991 --> 44:56.221
outside the walls
as quickly as possible...

44:56.260 --> 44:58.160
to keep the house under observation.

45:00.664 --> 45:03.656
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry, Mr. Beachum.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.396
Your Honor.

45:08.405 --> 45:10.532
So the house was
completely surrounded...

45:10.574 --> 45:12.371
within minutes of your arrival.

45:12.409 --> 45:13.535
All four sides.

45:13.577 --> 45:16.512
And neither you nor any other officer...

45:16.547 --> 45:20.176
saw anyone go into or
come out of that house.

45:20.217 --> 45:21.206
No.

45:21.251 --> 45:22.411
And what happened next?

45:22.453 --> 45:24.717
The bullet pierced
through the frontal cortex...

45:24.755 --> 45:25.881
and the temporal lobe...

45:25.923 --> 45:27.857
coming to rest on
the upper right side...

45:27.891 --> 45:29.882
of her brain, against the skull.

45:29.927 --> 45:31.019
And degree of injury?

45:31.061 --> 45:34.360
It inflicted grievous
and irreparable injury.

45:34.398 --> 45:36.798
Dr. Kang, is it safe to say...

45:36.834 --> 45:38.734
that someone who
inflicted this kind...

45:38.769 --> 45:41.397
of wound intended to kill?

45:41.438 --> 45:43.406
Oh... a moment, uh...

45:43.440 --> 45:44.566
Mr. Crawford?

45:44.608 --> 45:46.405
Yes, Your Honor?

45:46.443 --> 45:48.138
You might want to object.

45:48.178 --> 45:51.705
The witness can't know
your state of mind.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.444
Uh, no, thank you, Your Honor.

45:55.953 --> 45:57.215
Proceed.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.718
Sorry.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.785
And after you put down your gun...

46:04.828 --> 46:06.762
what did Mr. Crawford do?

46:06.797 --> 46:09.766
He confessed to shooting his wife.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.291
He confessed.

46:12.336 --> 46:15.396
Now, did Mr. Crawford
appear confused...

46:15.439 --> 46:19.068
intoxicated,
or impaired in any way?

46:19.109 --> 46:20.098
No.

46:20.144 --> 46:21.270
No, not at all.

46:21.311 --> 46:22.778
He knew exactly what was going on.

46:22.813 --> 46:30.185
Detective Nunally,
what did Mr. Crawford say?

46:30.220 --> 46:34.782
He said: "It was like
I just suddenly snapped.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.658
"I got the gun and I shot my wife.

46:37.694 --> 46:39.093
"I shot her in the head."

46:39.129 --> 46:40.289
Objection.

46:40.330 --> 46:43.265
I'm sorry, Mr. Crawford,
did you say something?

46:43.300 --> 46:45.791
Yes, I wish to object.

46:45.836 --> 46:47.303
On what grounds?

46:47.337 --> 46:48.827
I don't know.

46:48.872 --> 46:50.806
Your Honor...

46:50.841 --> 46:54.641
Um, I don't know what, uh,
you'd call it, but, uh...

46:54.678 --> 46:56.373
they... It wasn't
the first time it happened either...

46:56.413 --> 46:57.402
but, um...

46:57.447 --> 46:59.312
I, um...

46:59.349 --> 47:03.979
I don't know the... uh,
legal terminology.

47:04.021 --> 47:06.785
Well, why don't you try and
explain it in layman's terms?

47:08.158 --> 47:09.750
Um...

47:09.793 --> 47:11.658
fucking the victim.

47:16.733 --> 47:19.497
Well, you said layman's terms.

47:19.536 --> 47:20.798
Your Honor...

47:20.838 --> 47:22.362
I'm sorry, Your Honor, but
what would you call it...

47:22.406 --> 47:24.397
legally, when the officer
who arrested you was...

47:24.441 --> 47:27.410
having sexual intercourse
with your wife?

47:27.444 --> 47:29.071
You know, I think it's objectionable.

47:29.112 --> 47:31.012
It's rather disgusting is
what I think, but, uh...

47:31.048 --> 47:32.743
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

47:36.019 --> 47:38.112
Tss...

47:38.155 --> 47:39.918
um, Rob?

47:41.859 --> 47:43.656
Um...

47:43.694 --> 47:45.559
Oh, shit.

47:52.636 --> 47:53.762
Can I talk to you for a second?

47:55.405 --> 47:56.429
Aah!

47:56.473 --> 47:58.998
- Uhh!
- Aah!

47:59.042 --> 48:00.373
Order. Order.

48:00.410 --> 48:01.672
Just... Bailiffs... Order!

48:01.712 --> 48:04.272
Order! Bailiffs! Please!

48:04.314 --> 48:05.576
You lying son of a bitch.

48:05.616 --> 48:07.413
We're in recess.

48:18.428 --> 48:19.725
He had my witness list...

48:19.763 --> 48:21.731
and he should've filed to suppress.

48:21.765 --> 48:23.392
My mistake. I'm sorry.

48:23.433 --> 48:25.060
Mr. Crawford, you were warned.

48:25.102 --> 48:26.933
You don't get to use that
as an excuse to play games.

48:26.970 --> 48:28.665
Well, what about the
fact that it's true?

48:28.705 --> 48:30.070
I mean, isn't that the point here...

48:30.107 --> 48:31.540
to get to the truth?

48:31.575 --> 48:33.440
Mr. Beachum, is it true?

48:33.477 --> 48:35.741
I have no idea, Your Honor...

48:35.779 --> 48:37.747
I just heard about it five minutes ago.

48:37.781 --> 48:39.078
Put him back on the witness stand...

48:39.116 --> 48:40.208
if you don't believe me.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.241
This is getting out of hand,
Your Honor.

48:42.286 --> 48:44.379
Now, he just provoked my witness...

48:44.421 --> 48:46.082
with an outrageous allegation.

48:46.123 --> 48:47.590
My Dick has evidence.

48:47.624 --> 48:48.613
Excuse me?

48:48.659 --> 48:49.921
My Dick, my private investigator.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.086
I call him Dick.

48:51.128 --> 48:53.119
Perhaps I should call him
as a rebuttal witness.

48:53.163 --> 48:54.425
Uh, because since the tragedy...

48:54.464 --> 48:57.365
um, he's dug up hotel
records and witnesses...

48:57.401 --> 48:59.426
that confirm that my wife
and Mr. Nunally...

48:59.469 --> 49:00.458
were having an affair.

49:00.504 --> 49:01.766
My Dick is good.

49:01.805 --> 49:04.569
Your Honor, so what if he was?

49:04.608 --> 49:05.597
Mr. Beachum.

49:05.642 --> 49:06.939
Even if he was...

49:06.977 --> 49:08.467
Your witness was intimate
with the victim...

49:08.512 --> 49:11.777
and assaulted the defendant
during the arrest.

49:11.815 --> 49:13.146
Actually, while trying to obtain...

49:13.183 --> 49:14.946
my so-called confession.

49:14.985 --> 49:16.009
Yes.

49:16.053 --> 49:18.248
Oh, come on.

49:18.288 --> 49:20.188
Is that a legal argument,
"Oh, come on"?

49:20.223 --> 49:22.953
Don't make me come across
this table 'cause I will...

49:22.993 --> 49:24.153
I just want...

49:24.194 --> 49:25.957
Your Honor, he dictated
and signed his confession...

49:25.996 --> 49:28.624
at the station long after
the incident, all right?

49:28.665 --> 49:30.462
In fear for my life,
since my wife's lover...

49:30.500 --> 49:31.797
who had just beaten me...

49:31.835 --> 49:34.201
uh, was in the room
with his friends...

49:34.237 --> 49:36.262
and the other officers.

49:36.306 --> 49:38.001
Was detective Nunally present...

49:38.041 --> 49:39.838
during Mr. Crawford's interrogation?

49:42.713 --> 49:46.513
Uh... he... he... he may
have been, I don't know.

49:46.550 --> 49:47.812
Because if that is indeed the case...

49:47.851 --> 49:50.376
the confessions,
both of them, are out.

49:50.420 --> 49:51.978
If Nunally was there...

49:52.022 --> 49:53.717
Mr. Crawford was under duress.

49:53.757 --> 49:55.850
The confessions and
any evidence gathered...

49:55.892 --> 49:56.916
while Mr. Nunally was present...

49:56.960 --> 49:57.984
will all have to be excluded...

49:58.028 --> 49:59.495
as "fruit of the poisonous tree."

49:59.529 --> 50:00.518
This... this is insane.

50:00.564 --> 50:01.656
That's the Bible, isn't it?

50:01.698 --> 50:02.824
The fruit of the tree and all that?

50:02.866 --> 50:03.992
It's Matthew.

50:04.034 --> 50:06.002
Or is it Mark?

50:06.036 --> 50:08.004
He set all this up.

50:08.038 --> 50:10.404
This is a setup.

50:10.440 --> 50:11.668
I'm sorry, Mr. Beachum...

50:11.708 --> 50:14.006
but I am not going to allow
coerced confessions...

50:14.044 --> 50:15.170
in my courtroom.

50:15.212 --> 50:16.679
Your Honor, do you think
I could go home now...

50:16.713 --> 50:17.839
with Thanksgiving around the corner?

50:17.881 --> 50:19.508
Unbelievable.

50:19.549 --> 50:21.210
Don't push it, Mr. Crawford.

50:21.251 --> 50:23.515
What I want to do
is I'm going to give...

50:23.553 --> 50:24.713
Mr. Beachum a few days...

50:24.755 --> 50:26.313
to come up with
some new evidence...

50:26.356 --> 50:29.757
and if he can't then...
maybe you can go home.

50:29.793 --> 50:34.025
So we will reconvene
on Monday morning.

50:34.064 --> 50:35.224
I think that's all.

50:35.265 --> 50:36.732
Thank you, Your Honor.

50:39.903 --> 50:41.234
Farewell.

50:48.378 --> 50:51.074
Didn't even have the guts
to come talk to me.

50:52.582 --> 50:54.379
I was going to...

50:54.418 --> 50:56.613
after I figured out...

50:56.653 --> 50:57.881
uh!!

50:57.921 --> 50:59.479
How I was gonna handle it.

50:59.523 --> 51:01.787
What makes you think
that's your decision?

51:03.927 --> 51:05.258
You taking me off this case?

51:05.295 --> 51:07.229
Your bags are already packed.

51:07.264 --> 51:08.754
Just go.

51:10.100 --> 51:11.863
Even if I find new evidence?

51:11.902 --> 51:12.891
From where?

51:12.936 --> 51:14.733
The evidence store?

51:14.771 --> 51:17.535
What, are they open early
the day after Thanksgiving?

51:17.574 --> 51:21.408
My witness lied to me.

51:21.445 --> 51:22.878
Yes, because he could.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.278
Because you weren't looking.

51:24.314 --> 51:25.611
And I know why.

51:25.649 --> 51:28.140
Your head was in the fast lane
on your big salary.

51:28.185 --> 51:29.777
So you picked that
and what we do here...

51:29.820 --> 51:31.219
is not very important anymore.

51:31.254 --> 51:33.916
So that's what this is about, isn't it?

51:33.957 --> 51:36.084
I'm not gonna be like
you in 20 years.

51:36.126 --> 51:37.787
Hey, you be very careful.

51:37.828 --> 51:40.422
You wanna judge me,
be my guest...

51:40.464 --> 51:41.931
but this thing was a setup.

51:41.965 --> 51:44.832
The confession, everything.

51:44.868 --> 51:46.130
Maybe.

51:46.169 --> 51:48.467
But it didn't have to turn
into a public humiliation...

51:48.505 --> 51:50.439
for this office.

51:50.474 --> 51:52.169
You walked in there unprepared.

51:52.209 --> 51:55.508
You were arrogant and sloppy,
and you did damage.

51:55.545 --> 51:57.843
How much, we don't even know yet.

51:57.881 --> 52:00.145
And I noticed you didn't
even care to ask.

52:00.183 --> 52:01.616
But don't worry yourself, Willy.

52:01.651 --> 52:03.710
We'll clean up after you.

52:29.646 --> 52:30.977
Bourbon.

52:40.157 --> 52:41.215
All right.

52:43.293 --> 52:44.692
So...

52:45.695 --> 52:48.163
you got killed today.

52:48.198 --> 52:50.962
Gotta admire the cleverness of it.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.468
Oh, yeah?

52:52.502 --> 52:55.494
Sure, give the devil his due.

52:55.539 --> 52:57.370
So, what did Lobruto say?

52:58.642 --> 53:00.269
Took me off the case.

53:00.310 --> 53:01.709
Good.

53:01.745 --> 53:03.337
- Is it?
- Yeah.

53:03.380 --> 53:04.870
Damage control.

53:06.383 --> 53:07.907
Look, you don't know this guy.

53:07.951 --> 53:11.011
I had to fight with Burt today...

53:11.054 --> 53:13.545
to stop him from firing you.

53:21.698 --> 53:22.687
You want this, right?

53:24.734 --> 53:25.723
Yeah.

53:28.738 --> 53:30.069
Good.

53:33.743 --> 53:35.677
I have to hang out here
another hour...

53:36.780 --> 53:38.714
so...

53:38.748 --> 53:41.216
I think you should go home.

53:42.252 --> 53:44.277
And I'd like you to call me later.

53:48.925 --> 53:50.586
Call me later.

54:23.226 --> 54:24.557
Hmm?

54:26.463 --> 54:27.794
Hmm.

54:30.967 --> 54:32.764
Mmm.

54:32.802 --> 54:33.791
Mmm.

54:37.140 --> 54:38.767
You, uh...

54:38.808 --> 54:41.868
y... you don't have to go.

54:41.911 --> 54:43.845
Yeah, I do.

54:57.394 --> 54:59.555
No big family Thanksgiving?

54:59.596 --> 55:00.756
No.

55:03.933 --> 55:06.128
Well, I have to...

55:06.169 --> 55:08.831
put in some face time
with mine, if you want.

55:13.910 --> 55:14.899
All right.

55:20.350 --> 55:21.647
Thanks.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.284
Don't thank me yet.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.206
Mr. Beachum, can I help you?

56:20.243 --> 56:21.642
Look, please, Mr. Beachum!

56:25.248 --> 56:27.011
I want it back.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.215
I take complete responsibility
for what happened.

56:34.090 --> 56:35.216
Although I do feel...

56:35.258 --> 56:37.556
like it would have
happened to anyone.

56:37.594 --> 56:40.028
But if I'd been paying attention...

56:40.063 --> 56:43.362
it wouldn't happen to me.

56:43.400 --> 56:45.527
I'm not giving you back this case...

56:45.568 --> 56:48.093
so you can repair your ego.

56:49.606 --> 56:51.574
Well, it's not just about my ego.

56:51.608 --> 56:56.238
It's also about the fact
that, uh, this guy...

56:56.279 --> 56:58.907
he's just enjoying all of this.

56:58.948 --> 57:00.973
Enjoying this?

57:01.017 --> 57:02.006
But that's not evidence.

57:02.051 --> 57:03.643
Right, but...

57:03.686 --> 57:06.086
someone's gotta put him away.

57:08.124 --> 57:10.752
If you just give me a chance.

57:10.794 --> 57:14.696
And if there's a way, I'll find it.

57:14.731 --> 57:17.359
And if you can't?

57:17.400 --> 57:21.029
Listen, you leave now, I replace you.

57:21.070 --> 57:24.062
I'm covered, I took some action.

57:24.107 --> 57:26.598
But if you go on with this
and you lose...

57:26.643 --> 57:28.235
I guarantee you your shiny new job...

57:28.278 --> 57:30.075
will not be waiting for you.

57:30.113 --> 57:31.910
And I can't keep you on here.

57:31.948 --> 57:35.475
This is a public office.
Heads gotta roll.

57:38.354 --> 57:40.117
Still want it back?

57:47.163 --> 57:48.790
Thank you.

57:49.833 --> 57:51.232
Yeah.

57:52.836 --> 57:53.996
The gun's in the house.

57:54.037 --> 57:58.440
Yeah, except it's also just not.

57:58.475 --> 57:59.737
Then what'd he do, Detective?

57:59.776 --> 58:01.539
He tie it to a goddamn helium balloon?

58:01.578 --> 58:02.977
Maybe.

58:03.012 --> 58:06.209
Maybe he, uh...
dissolved it in acid.

58:06.249 --> 58:08.649
You got a DOB on that?

58:08.685 --> 58:10.016
You know, Detective...

58:13.022 --> 58:15.217
your inability to do
your job effectively...

58:15.258 --> 58:17.818
is making it very difficult
for me to do mine.

58:17.861 --> 58:18.850
All right?

58:18.895 --> 58:20.487
I'm back in trial...

58:20.530 --> 58:22.794
on Monday.

58:22.832 --> 58:24.231
OK, fine.

58:24.267 --> 58:25.359
I'll get a team together.

58:25.401 --> 58:27.926
I'll go over it one more time.

58:27.971 --> 58:29.905
And that's it.

58:38.581 --> 58:40.845
My wife took the kids to her mom's.

58:40.884 --> 58:44.081
And I got the media
all over my front lawn.

58:44.120 --> 58:46.554
What were you thinking?

58:46.589 --> 58:50.525
You get called to your
girlfriend's house?

58:50.560 --> 58:53.188
I didn't know it was her house.

58:53.229 --> 58:54.856
Well, it's her last name.

58:58.902 --> 59:01.166
I didn't know her last name.

59:03.239 --> 59:05.833
Not her real one, anyway.

59:05.875 --> 59:11.677
We just... we met at the Miramar,
same time, twice a week and...

59:11.714 --> 59:14.114
There were no questions asked
and there were no phone calls...

59:14.150 --> 59:16.675
and that's just the...
that's... those were the rules.

59:16.719 --> 59:18.186
Those were her rules.

59:18.221 --> 59:19.882
All right. Did you, uh...

59:19.923 --> 59:21.788
get the feeling that she
had all these rules...

59:21.824 --> 59:23.724
'cause she'd been doing it
before with other guys?

59:24.961 --> 59:26.724
Be honest.

59:26.763 --> 59:27.991
No.

59:28.031 --> 59:30.329
Listen, I don't know if
you can understand this...

59:30.366 --> 59:32.391
because you're
a fucking lawyer, but...

59:32.435 --> 59:33.527
this thing that we had...

59:33.570 --> 59:34.696
whatever it was, it was real.

59:34.737 --> 59:35.863
It wasn't just an affair.

59:35.905 --> 59:38.430
This girl, she made me feel like...

59:41.077 --> 59:42.567
What was I supposed to do?

59:44.247 --> 59:45.407
Tell me.

59:45.448 --> 59:47.643
I tried to warn you, didn't I?

59:49.452 --> 59:52.615
No, you warned me that he was smart.

59:54.624 --> 59:56.592
You didn't warn me...

59:56.626 --> 59:58.116
that you were stupid.

59:58.161 --> 59:59.753
Fuck you, you little punk.

59:59.796 --> 01:00:00.785
Fuck you!

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.388
Fuck me?

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.229
Oh, you already did that.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.700
I didn't think that he knew, OK?

01:00:05.735 --> 01:00:06.793
I didn't... There was...

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:08.497
There was no way for me
to know that he knew.

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.972
I just thought the guy
was fucking nuts!

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.167
Ya know?!

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:35.154
Y'all got security cameras, right?

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:37.393
Uh, yes, we do.

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:40.368
Can I get a copy of those
tapes from November 10th?

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:42.166
Uh, as soon as I can.

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:43.604
Uhh...

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.632
I'm just... I'm a little...
I'm, uh, under the gun, here.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:47.665
Oh.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.617
That's, uh,
exactly the way he left 'em?

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:00.987
Yes.

01:01:01.991 --> 01:01:02.980
Mm-hmm.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:14.026
What, were they planning
a trip next week?

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.065
Excuse me.

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:20.835
Crawford Aeronautics.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:22.310
Yes, he is.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:24.176
It's for you.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.204
Just pick up line one.

01:01:32.722 --> 01:01:33.746
Hello?

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.190
Hey, Willy, old sport.
How is it going?

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:38.750
Uh...

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:40.786
well, I'm...

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:43.856
Still out here and you're
still in there, so...

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.527
Yeah, you're right, there.

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:47.832
So the world still
makes sense, does it?

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.531
Uh, have you got
everything you need, Willy?

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:51.369
Uh, would you like some coffee?

01:01:53.242 --> 01:01:54.971
No, thank you.

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.172
OK.

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:59.579
You got some
new evidence, have you?

01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:03.781
What's the matter, Willy,
aren't we friends anymore?

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.151
I'm trying to help you.

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:08.214
You're in a bad place and
you've nowhere else to turn.

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:09.519
OK, I'm gonna hang up.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.550
Uh, do me a favor, will you, pal?

01:02:11.594 --> 01:02:13.892
Ask Tina to cancel my wife's tickets.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:16.626
Yeah, we had, uh,
plans to travel, you see.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.566
Get away, so to speak.

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:19.829
Next week, actually.

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:21.996
Sort of a, you know,
second honeymoon.

01:02:22.038 --> 01:02:25.974
Uh, painfully ironic,
that part, I must say.

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:29.569
But l... l... I don't think, uh,
Jennifer's gonna make it, Willy.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:30.601
Do you?

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:42.921
Whew.

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.256
Well...

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:46.784
tore the whole thing apart.

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:49.826
No gun.

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.465
I'm sorry, Willy.

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.566
Good night.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:29.328
"Do you dare stay out?

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.839
"Do you dare go in?

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:34.302
"How much can you lose?

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:37.403
"How much can you win?

01:03:37.446 --> 01:03:40.176
"And if you go in,
should you turn left or right?

01:03:40.216 --> 01:03:42.844
"Or right and three-quarters?

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:45.649
"Or maybe not quite?

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.315
"You can get so confused...

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.051
"that you'll start in to race...

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:54.393
"down long wiggled roads
at a break-necking pace...

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:57.888
"and grind on for miles
across weirdish wild space...

01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:03.895
"headed I fear towards
a most useless place...

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.306
"the waiting place.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.545
"For people just waiting.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.943
"Waiting for a train to go...

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:16.679
"or for a bus to come...

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:18.584
"or a plane to go...

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:22.614
"or the mail to come
or the rain to go...

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:27.686
"or the phone to ring
or the snow to snow...

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:31.723
"or waiting around
for a yes or a no...

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:38.036
"or a string of pearls
or a pair of pants...

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:41.066
"or a wig with curls...

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.906
"or another chance."

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:47.773
What are you doing?

01:04:50.853 --> 01:04:52.684
Hmph.

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.225
Uh...

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.888
I heard that it might help.

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.260
Who told you that?

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.423
Um...

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:08.096
the guy who shot her.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:09.695
Mmm.

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.905
Are you a member of the family?

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:16.343
I'm from the district attorney's office.

01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:19.612
Um...

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.742
and we...

01:05:21.784 --> 01:05:24.617
ran out of witnesses.

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:28.947
You know, she moved earlier.

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:31.453
She moved her eyelids...

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.189
like she was trying
to open up her eyes.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:34.662
Yeah, well... sometimes
we have to tape...

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:35.925
their eyes shut.

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.023
They all move, they...

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:38.966
they twitch, they make sounds.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.263
You think they're dreaming,
but they're not.

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:41.895
It's just...

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.633
It's just what's left of the system.

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:50.843
Normal reflex is downward.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.643
Up indicates brain trauma.

01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:56.281
Even if she comes back...

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.786
she may not remember
how to speak...

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.287
let alone who shot her.

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:02.347
What if she can hear you?

01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:04.916
She can't.

01:06:07.229 --> 01:06:08.423
It happens, right?

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.955
People wake up.
It's not impossible.

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:13.861
What are you gonna do?

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.302
Keep asking the same question
different ways...

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.464
till you get the answer you want?

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:20.574
I guess. That's what I do.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:23.675
Hmm.

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:27.345
I knew I shoulda gone to law school.

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.358
Did you like it?

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:11.860
I thought it was so funny...

01:07:11.894 --> 01:07:14.419
when he did that dance at the end.

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.090
Ha ha ha.

01:07:24.006 --> 01:07:26.668
Would you like some more wine?

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.509
Are you not gonna eat your turkey?

01:07:32.548 --> 01:07:33.913
I'm a vegetarian.

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.177
Heh heh heh.

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.548
White or dark meat this time, Willy?

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.280
Oh, it doesn't matter
either way, Your Honor.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.618
I think, uh, Willy's already
chosen the dark side.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:41.850
Ha ha!

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.359
Mr. Sierra Club
and Ms. ACLU here...

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.554
tend to give me a hard time
at the holidays...

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:47.857
because I can
buy and sell them.

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:49.922
We're not actually for sale, Nik.

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.125
All right, well, since you have...

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:52.759
the advantage on all of us...

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:55.794
surely it won't bother
you if we just mention...

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:57.772
to Willy that he could
put his talents...

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.604
to more noble use.

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.234
You don't have to do this.

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:02.608
Oh, that's all right.

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:04.579
I get this from time to time.

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.706
And it's most always
from people with money.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:07.909
Oop.

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.315
You win.

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:11.216
I usually do.

01:08:11.253 --> 01:08:13.153
Except in trial this week.

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.089
Nice, Lee.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:17.388
It's not over till it's over.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.417
That looked pretty over.

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:22.988
Anyway, Willy's off the case, so...

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.261
well, it may not seem
like it now, Willy...

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.564
but it's really a blessing in disguise.

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:30.470
Well, I'm actually not.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:31.529
What?

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:33.371
Off the case. I'm back on it.

01:08:33.408 --> 01:08:34.671
But that doesn't make any sense.

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:37.337
Lobruto has to do
some kind of damage control.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:43.118
Yeah, well...

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.143
I asked him to let me finish it.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:54.194
You didn't think
I might want to know that?

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.625
Did you hear me...

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:59.156
when I said I had to convince
Burt not to fire you?

01:09:01.002 --> 01:09:03.437
Could we not do this here?

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:06.669
Fine.

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:09.805
Actually, I need to talk with you.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.216
You lied to me.

01:09:18.254 --> 01:09:19.312
It doesn't work with me.

01:09:19.354 --> 01:09:20.481
Hey, uh, now, I didn't lie to you.

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:21.649
I told you I could be ready in time...

01:09:21.689 --> 01:09:23.157
and I still can be ready in time.

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:25.683
I got one thing,
one thing I gotta do first.

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:27.491
You're not in yet, Willy!

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:28.497
You pulled a stunt!

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:29.657
You got your foot in the door.

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:30.687
Did it ever occur to you...

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:31.825
that I could still win this case?

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:32.993
I don't care!

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.263
That's not what this is about!

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:35.667
What the hell is it about?

01:09:35.703 --> 01:09:38.502
It's about whether or not
you can do what you're told.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.099
You wanted corporate, right?

01:09:40.142 --> 01:09:41.166
That was the point.

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.337
Did I misunderstand that?

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.837
If you do this, if you win,
I'm still screwed.

01:09:46.881 --> 01:09:49.042
It says I don't know what
my subordinates are doing...

01:09:49.084 --> 01:09:52.076
my judgment is bad, and I'm
not in charge of my team.

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:54.180
I went out on a limb.

01:09:54.223 --> 01:09:56.248
I told Burt this was over.

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:59.718
I didn't ask you to do that, Nik.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.875
You know what nobody understands...

01:10:18.914 --> 01:10:19.938
about certain kinds...

01:10:19.982 --> 01:10:22.780
of low-paid public service work?

01:10:24.253 --> 01:10:28.019
Every now and then you get
to put a fucking stake...

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.719
in a bad guy's heart.

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.420
Now, we're not supposed
to talk about that...

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:36.090
when we visit a third grade
classroom for career day...

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:38.099
and it doesn't get you very far...

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:40.431
into a country club locker room...

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:45.771
but it's hard to beat
when you actually get to do it.

01:10:55.951 --> 01:10:58.249
I have some work to do.

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:00.585
Thank your family very much
for a lovely evening.

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.454
Thank you, Judge Gardner.

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:32.647
Officer.

01:11:35.824 --> 01:11:37.655
We gotta find the gun.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.593
I had three teams out there already.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:47.624
He did this.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.729
We know he did it, right?

01:11:49.772 --> 01:11:50.761
So...

01:11:53.008 --> 01:11:54.441
let's find it.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.137
We can't.

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:58.373
You wanna move on?

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:11.854
I know a guy in the evidence
room, and he owes me a favor.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:18.329
He can swap these
for the shells in evidence...

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:22.565
give us a ballistic match,
and we'll have our gun.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.507
Go home.

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.675
What else you got, man?

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.184
Go home.

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.708
What else you got, Willy?

01:12:47.396 --> 01:12:48.385
This is Willy Beachum.

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:50.125
You tell me what I need to know.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:54.359
Hey, it's me.

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:58.863
Things sorta got outta hand
today, and I guess...

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.033
well, I guess th...

01:13:00.075 --> 01:13:01.337
I guess this is something
neither of us...

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.901
was expecting
in our lives right now.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:06.278
And l... I think we have to...

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:08.215
I think we have to f...

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.514
to figure out what to do about that.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.213
This is where to find me.

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:14.381
Call me.

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:19.322
You have one unheard message.

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:22.194
Sent today at 4:10 p.m.

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.558
Hi, Mr. Beachum.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:25.897
This is Stephanie
from Miramar Hotel.

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:28.334
The security tapes you
were asking for are ready.

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.361
You can pick them up anytime
at the reception desk.

01:13:30.406 --> 01:13:31.395
Thanks.

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:41.746
You know it's him, all right?

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:44.912
There's no doubt
that that guy is him.

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:45.977
Whew.

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.785
Well, there's no face.

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:51.725
So? We enhance it.

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.486
You want me to enhance a hat.

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:56.759
You know that is him...

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.630
and he's there
on the day he shot her.

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.294
And why is he there the day of?

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.302
What?

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:03.361
Why is he there the day of?

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:04.429
What are you talking about?

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:05.599
This is a guy
who plans everything...

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:07.108
down to the hat, OK?

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:08.769
What's he doing there the day of?

01:14:08.811 --> 01:14:10.904
What part of the plan is that?

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:11.935
What the f...

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:14.946
OK.

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:18.316
He's there because
he's gotta see it for himself.

01:14:18.353 --> 01:14:19.445
They're at the pool.

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:20.785
Yeah, they're at the pool.

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.814
He's jealous,
his wife's having an affair.

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.018
No, no, man.

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:25.458
Come on. He's there.
He's getting worked up.

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:27.018
He's about to shoot her.
He's trying on the dress.

01:14:27.062 --> 01:14:28.324
He's sniffing her panties.

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:30.126
This guy, this guy here?

01:14:30.165 --> 01:14:31.257
He's a psycho.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.961
And the point is
that you're missing, Willy...

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:35.469
he's a psycho
we just caught on tape.

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:37.369
You got motive.

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:38.532
I do not have motive.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:39.598
You...

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.666
I don't have motive
unless I have him...

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:44.304
and I don't have face,
so I don't have him.

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:45.938
That is such lawyer shit.

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:47.380
It is lawyer shit!

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:50.647
Why d'ya think I'm getting
outta criminal law?

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:51.880
Huh?

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.978
And I'll tell ya something.

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:54.989
I'm not gonna end
my career on a case...

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:56.615
where all I have
is an enhanced hat...

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.024
when what I shoulda had
was a murder weapon!

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:00.323
That is new evidence.

01:15:00.362 --> 01:15:02.057
And what I should've had
was a signed confession!

01:15:02.097 --> 01:15:03.894
I told ya from day one
that he was playing games.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:05.559
And you were the man
shoulda got that for me!

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.590
That is a cop-out.

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:07.659
Don't you tell me that.

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:09.000
You couldn't find my gun...

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.334
and you're the one that let Nunally...

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.533
take the confession of a guy
he just beat up!

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.940
Nunally? Nunally lied to me,
that's what happened!

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:21.546
I gotta go make
a case outta nothing.

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.880
Just being an asshole.

01:15:49.144 --> 01:15:50.270
Uh, Beachum.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:51.574
It's done.

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:55.105
In the toolshed,
taped to the lawn mower blade.

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:51.132
2-10 eastbound.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:56.804
District attorney's office.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.617
Can I talk to you?

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:16.186
Have a seat.

01:17:16.231 --> 01:17:17.220
OK.

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.832
I'm not mad at you or anything.

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.340
Oh. OK.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:31.110
Um, are you all right?

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:33.845
Ahhh.

01:17:36.652 --> 01:17:37.983
Hmm.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.956
Can I ask you to do
something for me this morning?

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:44.981
Yeah.

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:47.518
You got your cell phone on you?

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:48.688
Yeah.

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:54.802
Could you sit outside the courtroom?

01:17:54.836 --> 01:17:57.066
'Cause I might call you.

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:59.699
And if I do...

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:01.538
uh, just hang up.

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:08.381
You come inside and whisper
something in my ear about...

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.578
finding the murder weapon.

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:14.079
You found it.

01:18:17.225 --> 01:18:19.352
I haven't decided that yet.

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:23.561
OK.

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:28.558
OK.

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:03.631
Mr. Beachum.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:06.563
Mr. Beachum, sir.

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:08.803
Mr. Beachum.
Mr. Beachum.

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:10.709
Mr. Beachum.

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.191
Mr. Beachum.

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:38.104
Uh, Your Honor, um...

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:40.301
I would like to submit
a motion at this time.

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:44.642
What... What type
of motion, Mr. Crawford?

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:47.170
I move for a judgment of acquittal.

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.139
Objection.

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:50.515
On what grounds?

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:53.248
Well, the prosecutor doesn't
have any actual evidence...

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:54.755
proving that I did anything.

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:58.820
I'm about to present
my evidence, Your Honor.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.225
But all of his witnesses will testify...

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:02.093
to the, uh, same facts...

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:04.621
that, uh, my wife was shot
and that I was, uh...

01:20:04.666 --> 01:20:06.725
tragically in the house at the time...

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.133
and, in a way, a victim myself.

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:09.831
And, uh, I'll stipulate
to the testimony...

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:11.395
of Mr. Beachum's entire
witness list right now.

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.771
And accordingly I move
for a judgment of...

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.401
I'm sorry.
Under the California...

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:17.308
uh, penal code section
11-18.1...

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:18.471
for a judgment of acquittal...

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:19.639
on the ground that the evidence...

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:20.807
before this court is insufficient...

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.214
to sustain a conviction.

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:23.717
Thank you.

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:26.448
Your legal skills
seem to have improved...

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.854
over the long weekend,
Mr. Crawford.

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:36.320
Mr. Beachum, have you
any new evidence?

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:37.991
Your Honor...

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:43.536
may I have a moment,
Your Honor?

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:12.856
Uh...

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:14.095
Your Honor.

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:16.400
Mr. Beachum.

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:30.878
Mr. Beachum.

01:21:53.108 --> 01:21:56.271
I have no further evidence
at this time, Your Honor.

01:22:07.455 --> 01:22:10.390
Motion for a judgment
of acquittal is granted.

01:22:10.425 --> 01:22:14.293
The jury is released
with our apologies...

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:16.126
and the defendant is free to go.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.467
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:27.498
Well, even a broken clock...

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:30.306
gets to be right twice a day.

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.482
Hey, Rob, take it easy, huh?

01:23:07.349 --> 01:23:09.044
Willy?

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.984
Hey, I just heard.

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.350
I'm sorry.

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:16.014
What'd you think,
I wasn't keeping tabs?

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.357
I don't know what I thought.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:24.665
Listen, what do you say...

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:28.157
I take you out tonight and
get you completely trashed?

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.795
Tomorrow's just a travel day.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:33.897
What was that? Willy?

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:37.572
Are you there?

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.540
Over here!

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:40.931
Initial there and there,
sign and date at the bottom.

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.208
Mr. Beachum.

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:05.718
What a surprise.

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:07.050
Now don't tell me, let me guess.

01:27:07.088 --> 01:27:08.953
You've got, uh, religion
or something, haven't you?

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.150
You've found God and all that stuff.

01:27:10.191 --> 01:27:12.284
'Cause it's not just the winning...

01:27:12.327 --> 01:27:13.521
or the losing anymore, is it?

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.529
It's the injustice of it.

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:16.552
Heh heh.

01:27:16.598 --> 01:27:17.895
This is priceless.

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.229
Oh, come on, Willy.

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:22.862
You gotta let me enjoy this
just a little bit, old sport.

01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:28.935
You really need to be
nice to me now, Willy.

01:27:35.683 --> 01:27:37.150
Why?

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.153
Because...

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:41.087
what's left of a life...

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:43.056
depends on a machine
powered by a cord...

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:46.925
that leads to a plug
in an electrical outlet...

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:49.794
and I decide when it gets pulled.

01:27:49.831 --> 01:27:51.298
That's why.

01:28:33.007 --> 01:28:34.440
Excuse me. I'm looking for, uh...

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:35.464
I'll just call you.

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.499
Oh, never mind. Thank you.

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:38.637
I called you all night.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.147
And I need your help.

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:41.808
I don't know anything
about civil court.

01:28:41.849 --> 01:28:42.975
And I gotta get...

01:28:43.017 --> 01:28:44.143
a restraining order right away.

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:45.447
This guy's gonna pull
the plug on her.

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:46.646
What are you doing?

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:47.882
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:48.980
You shouldn't be here.

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:50.320
I gotta tie him up in court.

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:51.484
I gotta challenge
his health care proxy.

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:52.788
I gotta find somebody.

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:53.987
I don't know who.

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.996
Like a... a... a family member
or something to stop him.

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.122
I really tried, Willy.

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.154
Hey, hey, hey.

01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:00.167
Don't.

01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:02.192
This man's gonna kill his wife.

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:12.911
This man's gonna kill his wife.

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:17.040
And what does that
have to do with Wooton Sims?

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:51.712
Hey. Excuse me.

01:29:51.753 --> 01:29:53.050
Hey. Sorry.

01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:54.554
Do you know any civil court judges?

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:55.886
Drop it.

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:58.892
Do you know any civil court judges?

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:00.393
I just need a number.

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:02.055
Have you been at home at all today?

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.291
No, I've been trying
to find somebody...

01:30:04.332 --> 01:30:05.959
who can put me in touch
with a civil court judge.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.230
There's a restraining
order out against you.

01:30:08.269 --> 01:30:11.397
I've got a... a restraining
order against me?

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.066
You were at the hospital.

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:15.905
- Right? Overnight.
- Heh heh heh heh ha!

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:17.570
And he got one against me?

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.239
Yeah. He has a lawyer now.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.043
They went to
Judge Gorman this morning.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:22.276
Hold on a second.
Who's his lawyer?

01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:23.578
Is it Goldstein?

01:30:23.618 --> 01:30:25.882
Listen to yourself.
He can have you arrested.

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:29.913
Your one shot. You had it. OK?

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.152
I know I had one shot
and I blew it, all right?

01:30:32.193 --> 01:30:33.922
Yeah. And he walked.

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.929
And there is nothing we can do.

01:30:35.963 --> 01:30:38.557
He's a private citizen now.
We have no standing.

01:30:38.599 --> 01:30:41.466
When you're done, you are done.

01:30:41.502 --> 01:30:43.129
Those are the rules.

01:30:44.806 --> 01:30:48.173
What about... her?

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:50.803
You have to worry
about yourself now.

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:56.784
No, I've... I've,
you know, done that.

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.647
I've done a lotta that.

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:31.211
Your Honor?

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:36.053
I got nowhere else to go.

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:43.886
Hi, Ted.

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:45.455
Hi.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:48.731
It probably won't hold up on appeal.

01:31:48.769 --> 01:31:50.862
I just need the time.

01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:54.331
Here we go.

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.662
Reflexes, no change.

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:35.377
Turn off the ventilator.

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.212
Ah.

01:33:03.311 --> 01:33:05.279
Hey.

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:07.571
Hey!

01:33:17.158 --> 01:33:18.455
Hey, what's going on?

01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:20.392
- Step outside, please.
- Look, I got a court order.

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:21.827
I'm sorry. Just step outside.

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.159
I got a c...

01:33:23.197 --> 01:33:24.664
I got...
I got a court order.

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:25.996
I'm sorry. Just step outside.

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:28.297
I got a c...

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:38.228
You're not answering your phone.

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.868
That's kind of an answer
in itself, isn't it?

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:48.010
Need a hand with this?

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.039
Uhh.

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:54.446
Can I get you a beer or something?

01:34:54.488 --> 01:34:55.580
Ha.

01:34:57.191 --> 01:34:58.556
Uhh.

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:02.085
Thank you.

01:35:03.497 --> 01:35:05.397
So what now?

01:35:08.235 --> 01:35:09.566
Something else.

01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:19.170
You belong in the prosecutor's office.

01:35:20.414 --> 01:35:22.848
Well, what happened to
"head's must roll"?

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.908
Yeah, well, it's my office.

01:35:26.754 --> 01:35:29.086
Least until the next election.

01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:32.755
Thank you, but no, thank you.

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:35.251
We all lose, Willy.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.364
I let a man get away with murder.

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:45.104
How am I supposed to live with that?

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:48.533
Well, you learn to.

01:35:50.444 --> 01:35:52.275
Well, I hope not.

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:58.549
All right.

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:09.125
Well, you know, if it
makes you feel any better...

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:12.496
technically you let a man get
away with attempted murder.

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:14.467
For what it's worth.

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:05.151
Yeah? All right.

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.646
I got it all right here.
I finished the r...

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:08.848
It's in the box right now,
it's coming.

01:37:08.889 --> 01:37:10.823
It's... Just a sec.

01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:13.656
Hey, honey. I'm just on a call.

01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:15.355
Yeah. OK, just a sec.

01:37:16.363 --> 01:37:18.126
No. I will not do that.

01:37:18.165 --> 01:37:20.690
It's not... and thank you. Good.

01:37:20.734 --> 01:37:22.258
Right.

01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:24.999
Well, I've... l... like I
said, reports are done.

01:37:25.039 --> 01:37:26.870
They're on their way.

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:29.565
Hey, hon.

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:30.736
No, did you get the suit?

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.006
Yeah, yeah, I got it cut.

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:33.070
Can I read that?

01:37:33.113 --> 01:37:34.307
OK, hon.

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:36.839
Um, I'll pick up the kids,
see you at the school.

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:39.045
I'll bring the suit.

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:41.247
No, no, I'll be there.
I'm leaving right now.

01:37:41.288 --> 01:37:44.223
I am not going to be late, OK?

01:37:45.326 --> 01:37:46.315
Hey.

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.349
Why don't you go home?

01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:48.520
Huh?

01:37:48.562 --> 01:37:49.859
Get a life.

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:50.886
Huh?

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:54.864
Alrighty.

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:56.870
Turn off the lights when you're done.

01:37:56.904 --> 01:37:58.599
Yeah, hon?

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:04.100
It's yours.

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:07.838
Here.

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:12.683
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:15.052
Hello, old sport.

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:22.388
Ah, Willy.

01:38:22.429 --> 01:38:24.124
Can you hear me?

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:28.901
I called to say goodbye.

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:30.062
I'm leaving tonight...

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:32.937
on that second honeymoon
we talked about.

01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:34.065
Uh-huh.

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:35.097
Won't be quite the same...

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:37.269
without our Jennifer, though, will it?

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:41.411
Anyway, I have a little
something for you.

01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:42.745
It's a present, a little gift...

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:46.617
and I was gonna send it
to Wooton Sims but, uh...

01:38:46.654 --> 01:38:49.452
I guess that's not
working out anymore...

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:53.392
and the DA's office didn't have
a forwarding address.

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:59.095
Um, do you have any suggestions?

01:39:22.856 --> 01:39:24.414
Uh, just let yourself in.

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:26.221
I'll be right out.

01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:23.978
Good evening, Willy.

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:33.387
So, what do you think?

01:40:35.295 --> 01:40:37.058
Oh, yeah, that's...

01:40:38.065 --> 01:40:39.191
really...

01:40:39.233 --> 01:40:41.167
really, really nice of you.

01:40:45.139 --> 01:40:47.699
A simple
"No, thank you," uh...

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:51.541
is the preferred etiquette
when declining a gift.

01:40:57.951 --> 01:41:00.419
Takes a very special sort of person...

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:05.517
to look into someone's eyes
and shoot them, Willy.

01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:10.590
A certain kind of strength...

01:41:10.631 --> 01:41:12.428
if you know what I mean.

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:17.434
Well, I guess you'd know that,
wouldn't you?

01:41:17.471 --> 01:41:19.268
Oh, yes, I would.

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:26.913
Anyway...

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:29.040
I've got another bag to pick up.

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:31.313
Don't you start shooting
without me now, will you?

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:48.598
I noticed something.

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.305
It's a little late.

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:58.776
Aw, hell, it's a lot late.

01:42:00.047 --> 01:42:01.514
But I noticed...

01:42:02.649 --> 01:42:04.116
that, uh...

01:42:07.321 --> 01:42:11.951
you and Nunally have
the exact same gun.

01:42:14.595 --> 01:42:15.653
So?

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:17.926
Well, that's why
you went to the hotel...

01:42:17.965 --> 01:42:19.432
that afternoon, isn't it?

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:23.903
You took his,
you put yours in his place.

01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:31.477
I gave it back.

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:35.209
Right, you gave it back.

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:40.384
When all he could see was her.

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:45.419
And then you knew that
he would just...

01:42:45.459 --> 01:42:46.653
walk the murder weapon...

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:48.524
right outta the house, didn't you?

01:42:51.532 --> 01:42:53.022
That's very clever.

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.199
It wasn't just clever.

01:43:00.674 --> 01:43:01.663
Admit it, Willy.

01:43:01.708 --> 01:43:03.232
It was beautiful.

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:07.006
He sat through the entire trial...

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:11.677
wearing the only piece
of evidence on his hip.

01:43:11.718 --> 01:43:13.709
Yeah.

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:16.553
Then he used it on himself.

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:19.748
Well...

01:43:21.128 --> 01:43:25.030
sometimes life gives us
these little gifts...

01:43:25.065 --> 01:43:26.430
if you know what I mean.

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:29.994
I do know what you mean.

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:32.562
I know exactly what you mean
because...

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:36.239
I got the bullet.

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:42.613
The one in your wife's head.

01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:44.048
That one we couldn't take out...

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.381
as long as she was alive.

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.854
I'm pretty sure it's
gonna match Nunally's...

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:50.754
and that gives me
the murder weapon.

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:00.260
Nicely done, Willy.

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:04.100
Truly.

01:44:08.609 --> 01:44:09.940
Heh.

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:21.087
A regular chain of evidence.

01:44:21.121 --> 01:44:23.248
Neat stuff.

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:24.587
Vivid.

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:27.423
Heartbreaking.

01:44:27.461 --> 01:44:30.760
The victim cries out
from beyond the grave.

01:44:30.797 --> 01:44:32.094
Aye.

01:44:32.132 --> 01:44:33.258
Yeah. Heh heh.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:35.097
Juries love all that sort of crap.

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.466
Don't they?

01:44:36.503 --> 01:44:39.267
I bet you don't even need
a confession anymore...

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:41.672
do you, Willy?

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:43.539
Oh, I tell you what,
though, old sport.

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:46.011
Uh, let's make you
a new one just in case.

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:49.641
The real deal,
all the juicy details.

01:44:50.984 --> 01:44:53.282
You can get your rocks off
on that, then, can't you?

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.480
Huh?

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:56.850
Yeah.

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.451
I shot my wife in the face.

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:04.293
Right there.

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:07.061
She didn't look so pretty after that.

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.261
And I stood there
looking down at her.

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:13.296
And I watched
her eyes go all empty.

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:16.207
I could smell
the blood and the shit.

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:19.477
Smelled like metal.

01:45:19.513 --> 01:45:20.980
And the look on his face.

01:45:21.014 --> 01:45:23.141
Aw, heh. He's trying to get
her back to life, you see.

01:45:23.183 --> 01:45:24.377
And I was pissing myself laughing...

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:26.716
because I took both the bastards out...

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:29.187
with one fucking bullet.

01:45:32.359 --> 01:45:34.827
Yeah.

01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:37.329
And now you've got your
little bullet, haven't you?

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:39.161
Got what you want.

01:45:39.199 --> 01:45:40.666
So bring it all on, kiddo.

01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.328
Bring it all into court.

01:45:42.369 --> 01:45:48.330
Except you can't, can you?

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:52.505
Let's see, now, first year law,
double jeopardy.

01:45:52.546 --> 01:45:54.013
I went to trial, you lost.

01:45:54.047 --> 01:45:55.514
Oh, pity about that.

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:59.007
Uh, doesn't matter what you do now.

01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:00.986
Doesn't matter what you know.

01:46:01.021 --> 01:46:03.854
I mean, she could come back
from the dead, you see...

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:09.658
and testify, spill the beans,
and it would mean... nothing.

01:46:14.568 --> 01:46:18.402
So you... can't touch me.

01:46:19.906 --> 01:46:21.771
Ever.

01:46:33.186 --> 01:46:34.619
She was alive.

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:48.233
When you first went to trial
for attempted murder...

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:50.429
your wife was still alive.

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:56.440
But you just had to pull
that plug, didn't you?

01:46:57.611 --> 01:46:59.272
Hmm?

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.810
Well, now she's dead,
and that's murder.

01:47:02.849 --> 01:47:04.407
That's homicide, first degree...

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:06.248
and that's new charges.

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:08.277
There's new evidence.

01:47:10.624 --> 01:47:12.285
That's a new trial.

01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:20.964
Get the fuck out of my house.

01:47:24.638 --> 01:47:26.629
All right.

01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:28.801
Whew.

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:33.135
I just don't know why
you didn't let it go.

01:47:35.649 --> 01:47:37.446
Doctor said, uh...

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:39.645
she probably woulda
outlived us all.

01:48:13.753 --> 01:48:15.186
All rise.

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:20.460
The superior court of Los Angeles...

01:48:20.494 --> 01:48:21.791
people of the state of California...

01:48:21.828 --> 01:48:23.625
versus Theodore Crawford.

01:48:23.663 --> 01:48:27.030
The honorable judge
Joseph Pinkus presiding.

01:48:38.545 --> 01:48:40.706
Are the people ready,
Mr. Beachum?

01:48:43.049 --> 01:48:44.516
Very well.

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:46.678
We will now proceed
with opening statements.

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.212
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, what you hear...
