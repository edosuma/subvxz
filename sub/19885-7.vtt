- Do you suppose it's true that
no two snowflakes are alike?

00:13.413 --> 00:16.515
I hope so. It's kind of
comforting, isn't it?

00:16.550 --> 00:19.718
- And the bank manager,
who happens to be my uncle,

00:19.753 --> 00:22.587
he said that the Cuthberts
are poor.

00:22.622 --> 00:25.924
- I've heard it said that snow
is a sign of God's forgiveness--

00:25.959 --> 00:28.226
- Shhh!

00:28.261 --> 00:32.097
- By blanketing the ugly, frozen
earth and making it beautiful.

00:32.132 --> 00:34.933
- Anne is poor?
- What do you mean, "poor?"

00:34.968 --> 00:38.570
- Poor, as in: "penniless old
fellow with no head for finance."

00:38.605 --> 00:40.172
- That's not very nice.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.941
- Snow means Christmas is coming,
and I love Christmas, don't you?

00:42.976 --> 00:45.777
- I don't know. But I plan to.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.712
- Did you not have Christmas
at the orphanage?

00:47.747 --> 00:50.415
- There wasn't much to it,
really.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.485
I'm not sure why Father Christmas
wasn't able to stop there.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.254
Maybe the matron scared him off.
- That can't be true.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.223
- The Cuthberts had to mortgage
their farm.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.358
Isn't that sad?

01:00.393 --> 01:02.627
- Josie Pye, you take that back!

01:02.662 --> 01:05.564
- Why are you upset?
It's only true. You're poor.

01:06.433 --> 01:09.134
Wait. You didn't know?

01:11.138 --> 01:15.273
Do you at least know if they're
going to keep you? - Keep me...?

01:15.308 --> 01:17.275
- Next!

01:17.310 --> 01:19.878
Come along. In Excelsis Deo.

Are you sure you're alright?

- I have to get on home.
Oh, Diana, it can't be true!

02:17.571 --> 02:21.072
- It isn't. That Josie Pye is
just as mean as they make them.

02:21.107 --> 02:23.542
She hadn't any right
to tell tales about you.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.711
- My first family.
My first home!

02:26.746 --> 02:29.481
- They're not going
to send you back.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.883
You're in the Bible
and everything.

02:31.918 --> 02:35.220
- We can't lose Green Gables.
We just can't!

02:35.255 --> 02:38.590
-<i> You mortgaged the farm?!</i>
<i>Are you out of your mind?!</i>

02:38.625 --> 02:41.893
You took out a loan against Green Gables?!
- It had to be done.

02:41.928 --> 02:45.263
- Why would you take such an action
without discussing it with me?!

02:45.298 --> 02:46.831
- I was trying to protect us,

02:46.866 --> 02:49.801
make the best
out of a bad situation.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.104
When the crop was lost,
we didn't have means.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.941
- Yet another thing
you neglected to mention!

02:55.976 --> 02:57.876
This is my home, too!
And Anne's!

02:57.911 --> 03:00.912
- I didn't want to talk about it.
- You didn't trust me?!

03:00.947 --> 03:03.882
To talk about our future?!
Anne's future?!

03:11.324 --> 03:13.525
- 'Cause I knew
you'd lose your head.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.394
- I ought to smack yours
right off your shoulders!

03:16.429 --> 03:18.964
- We have the loan.
That's done. And with it,

03:18.999 --> 03:20.932
I have purchased everything
that we need.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.235
- You've already spent the money?
- It's spent, yes.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.036
- Madness!
- On high-yield crops--

03:25.071 --> 03:27.606
- This is madness!
- Why can't you just listen?!

03:34.948 --> 03:38.483
We'll have a high-yield crop
and then another in the fall.

03:38.518 --> 03:42.087
So now we have two new crops,
in addition to the potatoes.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.722
We will be fine, Marilla.

03:43.757 --> 03:47.492
- So now, at your age,
you're working even harder?

03:47.527 --> 03:49.628
- Just a bit more work,
that's all.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.496
- I don't want you doing more.

03:51.531 --> 03:53.999
I want you doing less!

03:54.034 --> 03:56.635
Matthew? Matthew?!

03:56.670 --> 03:58.136

03:59.372 --> 04:02.173

- I don't know. I-- - What's wrong?!

- He's had an episode
of the heart.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.189
An occurrence
of coronary thrombosis.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.758
He's extremely lucky
it wasn't fatal,

04:53.793 --> 04:56.995
but make no mistake,
he's in a dangerous condition.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.596
- Dangerous?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.599
- It's going to take
a very long time to heal.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.401
He's gonna need months of rest,

05:03.436 --> 05:05.870
with no stress
or work of any kind.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.406
- Thank you.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.553
You should be asleep.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.255
- So should you.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.593
(sighing)

05:42.108 --> 05:44.576
- Wish I had a head for numbers.

05:44.611 --> 05:49.414
- I'm a dunce at geometry,
but I'm pretty good at math now.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.751
Which part is troublesome?

05:52.786 --> 05:55.454
- Here and... and here.

05:58.291 --> 06:01.960
- This is the amount that was
borrowed against the bank.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.862
- Yes, that much I know.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.398
- And this is the rate
of interest.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.301
Gosh, it's very high.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.572
And the payback schedule
is very short.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.908
Let me see.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.885
Carry the one...

06:28.421 --> 06:29.888
(sighing)

06:29.923 --> 06:33.858
I guess Matthew was counting
on making this amount

06:33.893 --> 06:37.395
from the new crops
plus the potato crops?

06:37.430 --> 06:39.898
- I'll have to go speak
with the bank.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.633
I need some clarity.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.336
- I'm coming with you.

06:47.273 --> 06:49.608
Even if you're not keeping me.

06:51.110 --> 06:52.778
- Not keeping you?

06:53.947 --> 06:56.948
You're a Cuthbert,
for better or for worse.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.284
No getting out of it now.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.720
And no need
for you to come with.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.690
- There most certainly is.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.726
I know for a fact
that when one is under stress,

07:08.761 --> 07:10.695
it's hard to hear
what's being said.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.999
It's as if the person speaking
is miles away or underwater.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.807
- I'll keep good watch over him.

07:22.842 --> 07:25.076
- We'll be back quick as we can.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.399
- This is most irregular.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.936
Where is Mr. Cuthbert?

07:52.272 --> 07:55.240
- Indisposed... unfortunately.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.575
I'm here on his behalf.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.711
- Most irregular.

07:59.746 --> 08:02.380
- My brother has suffered
a heart attack.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.517
It'll be many months
until he is well.

08:05.552 --> 08:07.519
- Difficult news indeed.

08:07.554 --> 08:09.187
- Yes.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.722
I'm...

08:11.724 --> 08:13.225
We're...

08:14.227 --> 08:18.029
Matthew and I are wondering
about the terms of the loan,

08:18.064 --> 08:21.566
and if we might get
an extension on the payments.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.601
- The terms of the loan
are clear.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.704
Mr. Cuthbert was the asset
we invested in.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.040
- That's why I'm hoping
to renegotiate.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.042
In light of the situation?

08:31.077 --> 08:33.044
- It seems you don't understand.

08:33.079 --> 08:35.247
This loan is now a bad risk.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.851
I am going to have to exercise
this clause, here,

08:39.886 --> 08:41.753
to pull the loan back.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.924
- Pull it back?

08:50.096 --> 08:52.230
- What exactly does that mean?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.731
(sighing)

08:53.766 --> 08:56.601
- I have already stated
that Mr. Cuthbert is the asset.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.203
If he is not able
to work the land,

08:59.238 --> 09:02.540
then we must call in the loan
by the end of the month.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.677
I'm sorry, but if there's no potential
for return on our investment,

09:05.712 --> 09:10.014
the investment must be returned
or the property forfeit.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.350
It is alright there.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.893
- Wait here, please.
I have a quick errand to run.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.397
"Green Gables" is... 11 letters.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.600
Adding up the rest...

10:03.436 --> 10:05.470
Thirty-six letters total.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.073
How much is that
for the advertisement?

10:09.108 --> 10:13.111
And how much more would it be for
distribution to the mainland?

10:17.116 --> 10:19.183
- Welcome home, dear ones.

10:19.218 --> 10:21.753
Sit down, sit down.
I stoked the fire.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.555
Warm your wee selves up.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.825
Matthew is resting well.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.964
What happened at the bank?

10:33.966 --> 10:35.967
- It's the end of everything.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.536
We're ruined.

10:38.571 --> 10:42.373
We're going to lose the farm.
Lose Green Gables.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.776
- Can nothing be done?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.811
- Our only hope
would be to somehow

10:46.846 --> 10:48.613
raise the amount of the loan.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.181
- We have to try.

10:50.216 --> 10:53.785
Everything of value will have
to be sold, right quick.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.953
It's a fearful sum.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.989
- I shall rally the troops
in town.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.024
I'm sure there are folks
who'll want

11:00.059 --> 11:01.826
to make a contribution.
- No!

11:01.861 --> 11:05.630
I will not accept charity. That's
final, Rachel. I won't hear of it.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.100
The Cuthberts do not,
and will not, take charity.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.609
- The Barrys will buy
our cattle.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.279
We can't keep Jerry on.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.616
Best get it over with.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.069
(sighing)

11:52.979 --> 11:55.179
- When you see everything
together like this,

11:55.214 --> 11:57.115
it's quite an array
of treasures.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.783
- They're just things.

11:58.818 --> 12:02.887
Matthew said the pawnbroker in
Charlottetown buys all kinds of goods.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.388
I hope he's right.

12:04.423 --> 12:06.491
- I'm looking forward
to seeing Miss Josephine again

12:06.526 --> 12:08.359
and staying overnight
in a guest room.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.930
Diana says that the manse
is ever so elegant.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.934
Oh, Marilla.

12:16.936 --> 12:20.071
I wish I had something of value
to contribute.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.940
Oh!

12:45.631 --> 12:47.932
We can sell it back
to the shop on our way.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.468
- Oh, there's no need to--
- This is a family effort.

12:51.637 --> 12:54.305
- Anne... come here.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.248
Matthew is...

13:05.084 --> 13:08.753
It's not wise for me to leave.
I need to be home.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.292
- I'll go on my own, Marilla.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.894
I can do it.
I'm a veteran voyager,

13:16.929 --> 13:19.397
and I'll be back
before you know it.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.399
- Jerry will accompany you.
- What? Uh, no.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.535
I-I'll be fine on my own.
I don't need company!

13:24.570 --> 13:27.004
- It's not for company,
it's for safety and assistance.

13:27.039 --> 13:29.774
- But this could be
a quintessential hero's journey!

13:29.809 --> 13:32.210
- You're not going alone,
and that's final.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.979
He'll auction the shire and take
his last wages from the sale.

13:35.014 --> 13:38.817
- But I don't need hi-- - I'll not
hear another word of protest.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.154
- It makes Marilla feel better
to have you along,

13:43.189 --> 13:45.056
but I really don't need you
to come.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.524
I've traveled alone before
without incident.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.293
- You've been lucky.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.796
- I've been smart.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.865
- So then both. Whatever.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.666
- I'd simply like you
to acknowledge the fact

13:55.701 --> 13:57.268
that I don't actually need
your help.

13:57.303 --> 14:00.404
- When's the last time
you drove a sleigh?

14:00.439 --> 14:02.506
Auctioned a horse? Let's go.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.709
- Anne!

14:04.744 --> 14:06.277
Anne!

14:06.312 --> 14:09.547
- Ah, Diana!
Diana, what are you doing here?

14:09.582 --> 14:14.185
- I'm so glad I caught you.
I brought you something to sell.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.554
- Oh. Oh, Diana, are you sure?

14:16.589 --> 14:18.590
- Of course I'm sure.

14:19.926 --> 14:21.693
- Thank you.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.567
- Morning, Diana.
- Good morning, Miss Cuthbert.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.535
I just came to say goodbye.

14:31.570 --> 14:35.539
- Be sure to get to Miss Barry's
before nightfall. Be safe.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.074
- We will.

14:37.109 --> 14:39.744
Be sure to tell Matthew
not to worry.

14:41.948 --> 14:44.616
Everything will be alright,
you'll see.

14:57.163 --> 15:00.197
- It's not so bad to ask for
help sometimes, you know.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.301
- If I needed help,
I would say so.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.636
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.204
- Wouldn't.
- Would. Times infinity.

15:07.239 --> 15:10.575
- What?
- Never mind. Let's not talk.

(bell dinging)

(footsteps)

15:51.784 --> 15:55.019
- Hello there.
I see you've been here before.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.921
- Only in my dreams.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.023
- How may I help you today?

15:59.058 --> 16:01.525
- I am here to return a dress.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.495
- Is something wrong with it?
- Not a thing.

16:04.530 --> 16:08.132
- Do you not like it?
- It is my very favourite thing

16:08.167 --> 16:10.501
that I have ever possessed
in life.

16:10.536 --> 16:13.905
But I need to return it
to help my family.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.340
- You're Anne.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.309
Matthew's Anne.
- I am.

16:18.344 --> 16:21.245
How nice it is
to hear it said that way.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.915
- What's happened, dear?
Why do the Cuthberts need help?

16:42.268 --> 16:44.168
(Anne crying)

17:03.589 --> 17:06.524
- Did Matthew
really spend this much?

17:06.559 --> 17:08.726
- You're worth a lot to him.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.695
Put it in here for safekeeping.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.598
- Thank you.

17:15.901 --> 17:18.035
-<i> "He healeth</i>
<i>the broken in heart,</i>

17:18.070 --> 17:21.005
and bindeth up their wounds.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.707
He telleth
the number of the stars,

17:23.742 --> 17:26.744
<i>and calleth them all</i>
<i>by their names."</i>

17:28.414 --> 17:30.415
- Stop here! That's it!

17:36.088 --> 17:37.555
I'm sorry.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.057
- I'll meet you back here after,
yes?

17:40.092 --> 17:41.592
- I hate to say goodbye.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.394
- I won't be so long.

17:43.429 --> 17:47.432
- To the horse, Jerry.
Why are you so annoying?

17:49.268 --> 17:51.902
You're a good horse, Burty.

17:51.937 --> 17:54.071
Try to remember that.

17:54.106 --> 17:58.075
Somebody will be very lucky
to have you.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.911
You'll be fine.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.290
(barking)

18:15.895 --> 18:18.262
- So you've been entrusted, eh?

18:18.297 --> 18:20.364
How old are you?
- Old enough.

18:20.399 --> 18:23.534
- Alrighty, Old Enough,
let's see what's what.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.236
(grunting)

18:26.539 --> 18:28.739
There ain't much I ain't got,
so...

18:28.774 --> 18:31.342
I can't say
as I'll be too interested.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.043
- That's understandable.

18:33.078 --> 18:36.180
If these were ordinary items.
But they're not.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.915
- Never heard that before.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.389
Nope. Dime a dozen.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.825
- I doubt it. My parents
were given that as a gift

18:47.860 --> 18:50.327
when they were in service of the queen.
- Oh, sure, sure.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.831
- It was made by the royal potter.
Don't you recognize the stamp?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.432
The queen
was so indebted to them

18:55.467 --> 18:57.735
for the intelligence they brought
her during the Boer War.

18:57.770 --> 19:00.504
That's all I'm at liberty to say about it.
- Intelligence? Meaning what?

19:00.539 --> 19:02.173
- Espionage.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.674
- Meaning what?

19:03.709 --> 19:05.676
- Spying. For the Crown?

19:05.711 --> 19:08.179
I'm sorry,
that's all I can reveal.

19:08.214 --> 19:10.214
(chuckling)
- What a crock.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.684
- Amethyst.
- Hmm.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.319
Don't care.

19:15.354 --> 19:18.522
- That is a very special brooch.
- Mm...

19:18.557 --> 19:21.559
Not to me.
- It's been in our family for generations.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.027
- So keep it.

19:26.899 --> 19:29.800
Maybe I can give you
a small sum for it.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.402
To be nice.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.406
Maybe.
Let's see what else you got.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.545
- Oh, I'm sorry,
those letters aren't for sale.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.247
- Letters? Don't want 'em.

19:43.282 --> 19:46.550
- I'm keeping all this correspondence
from the tzar for posterity.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.085
They shouldn't have
been packed.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.854
- What a piece of work you are.
The tzar?

19:50.889 --> 19:53.524
- Alexander had an inclination
towards mysticism.

19:53.559 --> 19:57.928
He found my great-grandmother fascinating.
And she had psychic abilities.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.231
I'll never part with them.

20:00.266 --> 20:02.600
But I am willing to...

20:02.635 --> 20:05.135
let the Queen Victoria
vanity set go,

20:05.170 --> 20:07.371
and a few other precious items.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.340
There's only so much
one has room for.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.842
We're moving back to the manse
in England soon

20:11.877 --> 20:14.144
and there's too much
to travel with.

20:14.179 --> 20:17.114
The house there
is already so full of treasures.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.149
I shouldn't have
told you so much,

20:19.184 --> 20:23.520
especially after we went to all this
trouble to dress me in a humble fashion

20:23.555 --> 20:25.589
so as to avoid interest
from highwaymen.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.224
- So who's this from?

20:27.259 --> 20:29.627
Queenie or Russki?
- Neither.

20:29.662 --> 20:33.464
No, that, I believe,
belonged to Prince Albert.

20:33.499 --> 20:37.301
If you can't afford it,
I completely understand.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.136
(scoffing)

20:43.142 --> 20:46.944
- Ladies,
how is every little thing?!

20:46.979 --> 20:50.781
Oh, let's just move that
a little to the left.

20:50.816 --> 20:54.051
A little more.
Mm... a little more.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.288
Good.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.956
Pronouncement:

20:58.991 --> 21:01.859
We will be passing the hat
at the recital

21:01.894 --> 21:05.796
for those who lost their income
when the Dal Marie went down.

21:05.831 --> 21:08.399
The Cuthberts were hit
particular hard.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.502
- I don't really know them.
Do you?

21:13.939 --> 21:17.274
- "Be not forgetful
to entertain strangers,

21:17.309 --> 21:21.779
for thereby some have
entertained angels unawares."

21:22.948 --> 21:27.451
In the spirit of Christmas, I know
everyone will be moved to generosity.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.300
- Thank you.

21:55.214 --> 21:56.847
(crying out)

22:03.422 --> 22:05.923
(groaning and coughing)

22:19.271 --> 22:20.904
(whinnying)

22:20.939 --> 22:22.840
(background chatter)

22:41.293 --> 22:43.127
- Gilbert!
- Anne.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.029
- Gilbert.
- Hello.

22:50.469 --> 22:53.103
- I think I need to sit down.

22:53.138 --> 22:54.605
- Sure.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.907
-<i> So you like working</i>
<i>on the docks?</i>

22:56.942 --> 22:59.143
- It's a means to an end.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.979
I hope to get hired
on a steamer soon.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.548
- May I ask...
what about your farm?

23:04.583 --> 23:07.184
- I don't have to decide
right now.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.587
I want to see
some of the world first.

23:10.589 --> 23:13.290
If I come back to Avonlea...

23:13.325 --> 23:17.461
I want it to be my choice,
not an obligation.

23:17.496 --> 23:20.197
It's what my dad
would've wanted.

23:20.232 --> 23:24.902
I'm sorry to hear about Mr. Cuthbert
taking sick and all those troubles.

23:24.937 --> 23:26.470
- It still seems unreal.

23:26.505 --> 23:29.573
Even though I just sold
all our...

23:29.608 --> 23:31.575
Everything.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.144
But thank you.
- He's a good man.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.580
He offered to help me
with my land come spring.

23:36.615 --> 23:40.618
- I love him with all my heart.
I don't know what I'd do if...

23:45.123 --> 23:48.492
I owe you an apology.
- No, you don't. - Yes, I do.

23:48.527 --> 23:51.094
- I should apologize to you.
- No, you shouldn't. - I was rude.

23:51.129 --> 23:54.131
- But it was my fault.
- Can we please not argue for once?

23:54.166 --> 23:56.634
- Can you please stop
contradicting me?

23:58.303 --> 24:00.537
Gilbert, I am very sorry

24:00.572 --> 24:03.040
that I wasn't more sensitive
about your father,

24:03.075 --> 24:06.076
and what losing him
really meant for you.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.214
- It's water under the bridge.

24:10.249 --> 24:13.584
- I know so much more now
than I did then.

24:16.421 --> 24:17.921
Anyway.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.423
- Anyway...

24:22.427 --> 24:25.496
I should... I should go... work.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.740
- This one looks perfect.

24:36.775 --> 24:39.610
- "Green Gables in Avonlea."

24:40.812 --> 24:42.713
Nice.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.051
- I've missed you.

24:48.086 --> 24:50.320
- Yeah?

24:50.355 --> 24:52.956
- At school.
There's no one to compete with.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.927
- You want to spell out
a few words for old times' sake?

24:56.962 --> 24:58.929
- How about...

24:58.964 --> 25:00.364
"truce"?

25:01.567 --> 25:04.635
- T-R-U-C-E.
(both chuckling)

25:04.670 --> 25:06.904
Moody would've gotten
that wrong.

25:06.939 --> 25:09.273
- He would've!
(laughing)

25:10.242 --> 25:14.245
- Get away from her!
- Stop, Jerry! Stop! Stop! I know him!

25:15.581 --> 25:17.481
Jerry, what happened to you?!

25:17.516 --> 25:19.550
Are you alright?

25:19.585 --> 25:22.319
- I'm fine.
- Come here, come here.

25:22.354 --> 25:23.921
Sit down.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.091
What happened?

25:28.126 --> 25:29.893
- I'm so sorry.

25:29.928 --> 25:33.697
They took it. The money.
Bad guys took the money!

25:36.668 --> 25:38.302
- Don't turn around.

25:41.406 --> 25:44.374
- I'm so sorry.
- We need to get you to Miss Barry's.

25:44.409 --> 25:46.510
- I don't like the city.

25:49.147 --> 25:52.249
I remember you now
from the big fire.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.784
I'm Jerry.

25:53.819 --> 25:55.286
- Gilbert.

25:57.623 --> 26:00.357
Need my help with anything?
Anything I can do?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.392
- Just take care of yourself.

26:02.427 --> 26:04.027
And come home someday.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.229
- Yeah.
Hope everything works out.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.898
- For you, too.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.906
-<i> Au revoir.</i>

26:17.776 --> 26:19.876
- Uh, yes. Bye.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.412
- Bye.

26:33.659 --> 26:35.892
You sure you're alright?

26:35.927 --> 26:38.161
- I'm not so bad.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.564
So you sold everything?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.099
- Yes.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.415
- This is a palace, not a house.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.851
You sure
this is the right place?

27:00.886 --> 27:02.553
- This is the address.

27:04.389 --> 27:06.156
(knocking)

27:11.563 --> 27:14.531
- Yes?
- We're here to see Miss Josephine Barry.

27:14.566 --> 27:16.033
Is she at home?

27:16.068 --> 27:18.669
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Anne of Green Gables.

27:18.704 --> 27:21.038
- Oh, for heaven's sake,
Rollings, these are my guests!

27:21.073 --> 27:23.407
Come in, come in,
come in from the cold!

27:23.442 --> 27:25.509
I was beginning to think
you weren't coming.

27:25.544 --> 27:28.345
Oh, my dear Anne,
it's very good to see you.

27:29.548 --> 27:32.649
Dear me!
Whatever's happened to you?!

27:32.684 --> 27:34.885
Rollings, take poor, um...

27:34.920 --> 27:37.387
- Jerry.
- ...Jerry here downstairs.

27:37.422 --> 27:40.557
We'll get you cleaned up
and sorted.

27:40.592 --> 27:44.394
- Thank you. That's very kind. See you
in the morning. I'll look after Belle.

27:44.429 --> 27:46.596
- For heaven's sake,
there's room at this inn.

27:46.631 --> 27:48.565
You won't be sleeping
in the stable.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.934
I have guest rooms
prepared for each of you,

27:50.969 --> 27:55.305
so run along and wash up, then join
us for supper. This way, Anne.

27:58.944 --> 28:02.446
My, my, this is
an extraordinary undertaking

28:02.481 --> 28:04.514
under perfectly
dreadful circumstances.

28:04.549 --> 28:08.719
- It has been that.
- Oh, this city is rife with ruffians.

28:08.754 --> 28:12.389
It's a wonder anyone can walk
down the streets alone anymore.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.358
Good, strong lad.

28:15.393 --> 28:18.228
You'll manage things
at Green Gables, won't you?

28:23.602 --> 28:26.570
What? What have I said?

28:28.907 --> 28:30.373
- We can't keep Jerry on.

28:30.408 --> 28:32.409
He was getting
the last of his wages

28:32.444 --> 28:34.444
as part of the sale
of the horse.

28:34.479 --> 28:37.781
- But how will you run the farm?
- We're more concerned with saving it.

28:37.816 --> 28:40.016
We'll get to that part later.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.885
- You must let me help.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.754
- Oh, Miss Barry,
you're so kind,

28:43.789 --> 28:46.256
but unfortunately, I can't accept.
- Stuff and nonsense!

28:46.291 --> 28:48.558
This is no time
to stand on pride.

28:48.593 --> 28:52.629
- The Cuthberts will not accept charity
and so, as a Cuthbert, neither can I.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.765
- Hmm.

29:02.874 --> 29:05.008
- You shouldn't have let her go.

29:05.043 --> 29:06.877
- Oh, please don't fret so.

29:08.046 --> 29:11.114
Anne and Jerry
will be safe together.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.550
Here. Just take a little.

29:14.719 --> 29:16.253
- You and Anne,

29:16.288 --> 29:19.689
you'd be better off...
if I were gone.

29:19.724 --> 29:22.359
- What? I won't have you
talking like this.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.261
- My life insurance.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.030
It would hold
you both in good stead.

29:27.065 --> 29:28.565
- I won't hear it.

29:29.734 --> 29:31.535
- It's what I wish for.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.437
- Why would you wish that?

29:34.472 --> 29:37.374
You mustn't think such thoughts.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.810
We need you here.
- No.

29:39.845 --> 29:41.578
- Anne loves you.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.548
You have to remember that.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.783
- But... her future...

29:46.818 --> 29:49.719
- Which do you think
she would choose?

29:49.754 --> 29:51.555
This house...

29:51.590 --> 29:53.323
or you?

29:53.358 --> 29:56.260
Now stop
this morbid foolishness.

29:57.262 --> 29:59.263
(soft piano music)

30:08.440 --> 30:10.274
(owl hooting)

30:21.152 --> 30:23.453
- Anne. Anne.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.791
Can I sleep here?

30:28.793 --> 30:30.360
- What? Why?

30:30.395 --> 30:31.962
What's wrong?

30:31.997 --> 30:33.763
- I never...

30:33.798 --> 30:36.033
At 'ome,
I don't have my own bed.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.975
- What are you doing?

30:46.144 --> 30:48.945
- There's so many of us,
this is how we sleep.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.882
Don't worry,
I don't kick like my sisters.

30:51.917 --> 30:53.984
(chuckling)
- You'd better not.

30:58.323 --> 30:59.823
(sighing)

31:03.595 --> 31:05.362
Everything will be alright.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.099
It'll be alright.

31:11.269 --> 31:13.069
(birdsong)

31:13.104 --> 31:16.406
Thank you for providing us with
such a lovely port in the storm.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.742
-<i> Merci beaucoup.</i>
The food was amazing.

31:18.777 --> 31:20.377
- Glad to hear it.

31:20.412 --> 31:23.447
Books also provide ports
in the storm.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.718
- George Eliot.
I don't know him.

31:28.753 --> 31:31.521
- He is a her. Mary Ann Evans.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.423
- How wonderful.

31:33.458 --> 31:34.925
A nom de plume.

31:34.960 --> 31:38.361
- If you do write a book someday,
I pray you won't need one.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.930
- Thank you.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.799
- Oh, not at all, not at all.
Oh.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.436
Rollings?

31:46.471 --> 31:47.938
- Madam.

31:47.973 --> 31:49.706
- Jerry, I have something
for you too.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.076
You're going to stay on at Green
Gables and I'm going to pay for it.

31:53.111 --> 31:56.379
- Oh, Miss Barry, I've already--
- This is a business arrangement.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.582
I'm offering you a job
at fair wages

31:59.617 --> 32:02.585
that happens to be
at Green Gables.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.221
Do you accept?

32:05.590 --> 32:09.092
- Um...<i> Oui,</i> I... I do.<i> Merci</i>

32:09.995 --> 32:11.494
- Good lad.

32:11.529 --> 32:14.130
I'll be outside for a bit,

32:14.165 --> 32:15.933
tending to the livestock.

32:21.940 --> 32:25.742
I hope you've let go of that
fool notion of last night.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.411
We've been together
all these years,

32:28.446 --> 32:30.013
thick or thin,

32:30.048 --> 32:33.917
so don't think I'll put up
with you slipping away now.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.586
Anne will be home today,

32:36.621 --> 32:38.956
and she'll be very happy
to see you.

34:19.457 --> 34:21.091
(neighing)

34:42.780 --> 34:45.115
(knocking)

34:47.118 --> 34:48.618
- Hello?

35:02.400 --> 35:04.534
Matthew...

35:04.569 --> 35:06.403
- Jeannie.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.845
- Matthew! Jeannie!

35:15.880 --> 35:17.414
Help me get him to bed.

35:24.889 --> 35:28.391
- And I couldn't have found your
Anne more delightful if I tried.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.260
- I didn't know she sold it.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.763
- It made her so very happy
to help.

35:33.798 --> 35:37.300
- I don't want her suffering...
because of me.

35:37.335 --> 35:40.937
- Do you think she'd ever recover
from losing you this way?

35:44.609 --> 35:49.112
Matthew, you know too well
the impact of an untimely death.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.284
Anne has suffered so much loss.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.254
She finally belongs.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.190
Here.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.892
With you.

36:16.574 --> 36:18.541
- Don't ever get old.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.410
- Too late for that.

36:25.917 --> 36:27.584
I'll be on my way.

36:34.158 --> 36:35.926
Take care.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.360
-<i> How could you?</i>

37:11.562 --> 37:14.264
How could you even think it?!

37:15.233 --> 37:19.135
You would've left us that way?
Left me?

37:20.738 --> 37:23.139
- The thought of... of being...

37:23.174 --> 37:24.741
I...

37:25.743 --> 37:27.244
I-I couldn't.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.913
But I won't leave you.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.916
I won't leave you and Anne.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.086
Will you forgive me?

37:40.124 --> 37:41.591
Forgive me?

37:49.767 --> 37:51.468
- I'm home!

37:57.108 --> 38:00.710
Ah... you are a sight
for sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.249
You feeling any better?

38:06.284 --> 38:08.184
- Mm. I am.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.920
I am.
(Anne laughing)

38:19.897 --> 38:22.065
- This is from Josephine Barry.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.869
- Give it back.
I won't take charity.

38:26.904 --> 38:29.372
- But... love isn't charity.

38:29.407 --> 38:31.708
- I won't take it.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.844
- May I ask why not?
- We will not be pitied!

38:34.879 --> 38:38.047
I don't want people thinking
we can't fend for ourselves.

38:38.082 --> 38:40.083
- Well, at the moment, we can't.

38:40.118 --> 38:43.119
And I'd sure give
my last bit of strength,

38:43.154 --> 38:45.855
or my last dollar,
to help a friend.

38:45.890 --> 38:50.660
And I know that friend would feel
grateful and loved above all else.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.395
And I do.

38:52.430 --> 38:56.232
I feel very grateful to have such
a dear friend as Miss Barry.

38:58.202 --> 38:59.635
Sometimes...

38:59.670 --> 39:03.039
you just have to let
people love you, Marilla.

39:07.245 --> 39:08.878
- You're quite right.

39:12.383 --> 39:16.386
Even adding this...
and even with the cattle I sold,

39:16.421 --> 39:18.755
it's still a ways from enough.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.624
- We still have
a little more time.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.726
- A little. Very little.
- Plenty!

39:23.761 --> 39:26.195
There are still three weeks
until the end of December.

39:26.230 --> 39:27.864
- Three weeks.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.532
We could...

39:29.567 --> 39:32.736
sell off some farm equipment
if we're lucky.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.940
- I know what else I can sell.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.510
(knocking)

39:40.545 --> 39:43.045
Good day.
My name is Anne Shirley-Cuthbert

39:43.080 --> 39:45.615
and I'd like to offer you
my services.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.384
For a small wage,
I can give your home

39:48.419 --> 39:50.219
a thorough cleaning
before the holidays.

39:50.254 --> 39:52.122
I have all my own supplies.

39:53.624 --> 39:56.393
I can sweep, dust,
and scrub floors.

40:20.618 --> 40:24.086
<i>"When a tender affection</i>
<i>has been storing itself in us</i>

40:24.121 --> 40:26.589
<i>through many of our years,</i>

40:26.624 --> 40:30.426
<i>the idea that we could accept</i>
<i>any exchange for it</i>

40:30.461 --> 40:33.095
<i>seems to be a cheapening</i>
<i>of our lives.</i>

40:33.130 --> 40:36.165
<i>And we can set a watch</i>
<i>over our affections</i>

40:36.200 --> 40:38.001
<i>and our constancy...</i>

40:38.970 --> 40:41.971
<i>...as we can</i>
<i>over other treasures."</i>

40:49.480 --> 40:51.614
We're rich, aren't we, Matthew?

40:51.649 --> 40:54.818
- Well, now, I suppose we are.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.399
- Anne, Matthew,

41:10.434 --> 41:14.003
Jerry here has something for us.

41:14.038 --> 41:15.905
-<i> Joyeux Noël,</i>

41:35.459 --> 41:37.961

41:38.963 --> 41:41.964
I put a notice in the paper
to take in boarders.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.666
- We have two confirmed.

41:43.701 --> 41:47.403
- Now that we have a sizeable
portion of what we owe,

41:47.438 --> 41:49.238
and we'll have steady income,

41:49.273 --> 41:53.776
I'll pay a visit to the bank right after
the holidays to see about the terms.

41:53.811 --> 41:56.345
- So maybe we can keep
Green Gables?

I'm excited to have
a whole new year in front of us

42:32.950 --> 42:35.751
just bursting with possibility.

42:35.786 --> 42:39.589
The last one was quite
an adventure, wasn't it?

42:39.624 --> 42:41.457
- It was indeed.

42:49.834 --> 42:51.267
- What a bounty.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.369
You ladies
have outdone yourselves.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.538
- It's simple fare,
but... thank you.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.774
- I wonder what's happened to that
other fellow you were expecting?

42:58.809 --> 43:00.944
(knocking)
- That must be him.

43:03.347 --> 43:05.415
- I'll get it.

43:11.922 --> 43:13.389
(sighing)

43:15.726 --> 43:17.793
- Please tell me
this is Green Gables.

43:17.828 --> 43:19.895
- It is indeed.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.198
Won't you come in?

44:00.905 --> 44:02.872
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal

44:02.907 --> 44:04.874
(grunting)
- Ah!
