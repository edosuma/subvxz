was working as a clerk at that time,

30:12.101 --> 30:14.312
-Good. Where you guys headed?
-Dinner and a movie.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.230
Nice.

30:15.396 --> 30:16.981
So, be home at 11:00?

30:17.357 --> 30:19.776
Mom, I'm in college.
I'll be home by 12:00.

30:19.859 --> 30:20.819
11:00.

30:21.402 --> 30:22.529
How about 12:00?

30:22.612 --> 30:23.738
[both chuckling]

30:24.614 --> 30:25.740
Have fun, baby.

30:25.824 --> 30:26.950
Thanks. Love you.

30:27.033 --> 30:27.909
Love you.

30:28.409 --> 30:29.369
Bye.

30:29.452 --> 30:30.286
Bye.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.204
[chuckles]

30:31.287 --> 30:32.664
[Marcus] I don't get a hug?

30:34.332 --> 30:36.084
[Marcus] See, it's starting already.

30:38.294 --> 30:41.714
Honey, I feel like maybe we
should've ordered in.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.968
-I feel like I'm so behind.
-No, no, this is perfect.

30:45.051 --> 30:46.886
Table's set for three. We're good.

30:46.970 --> 30:47.804
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.722
-Okay.
-[doorbell rings]

30:49.806 --> 30:51.015
-She's here.
-I got it.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.561
Hey, man. Marcus.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.771
-Welcome to our humble abode!
-[Courtney] Wow!

30:56.855 --> 30:59.148
Beautiful. I hope you don't mind
the last-minute plus-one.

30:59.232 --> 31:02.527
-[Marcus] No! Not at all.
-Hey! Oh, you look beautiful.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.404
[chuckles]

31:04.487 --> 31:06.406
-How are you doing? You look gorgeous!
-Hi.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.367
Hi, I'm David. Nice to meet you.

31:09.951 --> 31:10.785
Ellie.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.663
Uh, before I forget.
I figured white goes with everything.

31:13.746 --> 31:16.332
Oh, yeah, man. Thank you.
I like this guy already.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.751
-[Marcus] Look at that, babe.
-[Courtney chuckles]

31:18.835 --> 31:20.628
-You guys want a tour?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

31:20.712 --> 31:21.963
Oh, yeah, come on. Out here.

31:22.046 --> 31:24.132
-This is what sold it, so...
-[Courtney] Whoa.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.633
...I'll show you that first.

31:26.634 --> 31:27.594
[Courtney chuckles]

31:28.636 --> 31:29.721
[sighs]

31:30.471 --> 31:34.267
[Marcus] I'll show you
the... main attraction here.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.019
Watch yourself.

31:38.021 --> 31:38.855
[David] Wow.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.818
[both chuckling]

31:43.902 --> 31:46.279
[chuckles] So, David,
listen, you gotta tell me.

31:46.362 --> 31:47.947
I'm familiar with tech consultant,

31:48.031 --> 31:49.782
but what's your lane?
What's your specialty?

31:50.158 --> 31:51.367
Actually, I'm a hacker.

31:51.451 --> 31:55.371
Babe! He's consulted with some
of the biggest firms in the city.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.875
Yeah, I'm the guy you hire when you need
information that doesn't wanna be found.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.044
Aha! Well, it's legal though, right?

32:01.127 --> 32:02.253
It's "unofficial."

32:02.337 --> 32:03.463
[Marcus chuckles]

32:03.546 --> 32:05.506
I'm surprised
your old firm never hired him.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.801
-Yeah.
-How'd you two meet?

32:10.053 --> 32:11.804
-You wanna tell them, or...
-No, no, you...

32:11.888 --> 32:12.972
-Okay.
-You tell them.

32:13.264 --> 32:16.184
Okay. So, I'm waiting
for the elevator one day,

32:16.267 --> 32:19.479
[volume lowers]
and up walks this very handsome,

32:19.562 --> 32:22.899
-[creepy music plays]
-very confident man, and suddenly...

32:24.067 --> 32:27.320
it was like everyone else
in the lobby just disappeared.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.280
I think I even heard music.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.823
[Normal volume, chuckles]

32:30.907 --> 32:32.241
[Courtney] Yep. [chuckles]

32:33.618 --> 32:35.244
Ah, so I introduced myself and--

32:35.328 --> 32:37.830
Yeah, and I was so captivated by her,

32:38.289 --> 32:40.959
I asked her out for lunch that afternoon.
Here we are.

32:41.042 --> 32:43.378
Turns out,
he'd just gone through a bad divorce.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.462
Oh.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.214
What happened?

32:47.632 --> 32:48.675
What's there to say?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.428
I had the perfect home, perfect wife.

32:54.055 --> 32:58.476
One day, you wake up, and it feels like
the person you've been sleeping next to

32:58.559 --> 33:00.603
for 20 years is a complete stranger.

33:01.896 --> 33:02.730
[Marcus] Wow.

33:03.022 --> 33:03.940
That's gotta suck.

33:04.399 --> 33:05.358
Yeah.

33:05.441 --> 33:08.277
-Babe, you don't have to talk about it--
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

33:08.736 --> 33:10.405
I mean, what hurt the most was,

33:10.780 --> 33:13.116
no matter how much time
and effort I put in...

33:14.325 --> 33:15.785
she didn't take me seriously.

33:18.246 --> 33:20.873
Well, hey, onward and upward, right?

33:20.957 --> 33:24.419
Another toast.
To new friends and happy relationships.

33:24.919 --> 33:25.878
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

33:25.962 --> 33:27.213
[Courtney] Cheers! [chuckles]

33:29.882 --> 33:31.009
Anyone up for dessert?

33:31.426 --> 33:32.885
-[David] Yeah. Yeah, sure.
-Yeah.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.849
-Courtney, wanna come with me?
-Yeah.

33:37.932 --> 33:39.809
-No, no, it's okay, baby. I'll get it.
-You sure?

33:39.892 --> 33:41.436
-Yeah.
-Okay.

33:42.645 --> 33:43.479
This guy.

33:44.939 --> 33:45.815
[sighs]

33:51.738 --> 33:52.739
Are you crazy?

33:54.574 --> 33:57.160
How dare you show up at my house.

33:57.243 --> 34:00.038
You don't return my calls.
You don't return my texts.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.791
-How else am I supposed to reach you?
-You're not supposed to.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.376
You don't have to worry.

34:05.918 --> 34:06.961
Our secret is safe.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.504
My husband...

34:09.922 --> 34:11.966
My husband is outside.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.177
Do you not see
what I'm willing to do for you?

34:14.260 --> 34:15.844
Don't you touch me.

34:16.262 --> 34:19.348
-This could work.
-I don't know what you think this is,

34:19.974 --> 34:22.143
but I want you to go outside right now

34:22.226 --> 34:26.355
and come up with an excuse
as to why you need to leave early.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.400
And I don't ever wanna see you around me,

34:29.859 --> 34:33.987
my daughter, my husband,
or my home ever again.

34:35.947 --> 34:37.533
Do you understand?

34:49.504 --> 34:50.463
[whimpers]

34:52.632 --> 34:54.509
Just got off the phone with a client.

34:55.009 --> 34:58.137
The file I was working with got corrupted,
so, uh... and they need it tonight.

34:58.471 --> 34:59.305
So I gotta go.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.682
-Oh! Mm-hmm.
-Courtney, I can take you home.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.064
No. No, that's okay.
I don't want you to have to drive

35:08.147 --> 35:10.817
all the way back by yourself.
That's... It's fine.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.654
-Call me.
-Yeah.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.157
-What's wrong? Everything okay?
-No, I'm fine.

35:20.868 --> 35:22.036
[door opens]

35:52.567 --> 35:54.569
[sinister music playing]

36:10.501 --> 36:12.920
[over recording] Hi, you've reached
Courtney. Leave a message.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.088
[beeps]

36:14.755 --> 36:17.925
Courtney, it's Ellie,
and I need you to call me back.

36:18.009 --> 36:21.512
I've left you so many messages.
I need to talk to you.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.639
Hey, Mom. What's this?

36:23.973 --> 36:26.017
-Call me back.
-Oh! "Forget Me Nots."

36:26.100 --> 36:28.311
-I remember this song.
-[chuckles]

36:28.394 --> 36:29.562
Where did you get this?

36:29.812 --> 36:33.441
Uh, I actually found it
in a box in the garage.

36:33.524 --> 36:37.069
Oh, this could be worth some real money.
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.322
-I'll keep it.
-Okay.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.365
[indistinct chattering]

36:49.665 --> 36:50.875
-Hey.
-Don't!

36:59.634 --> 37:00.718
I know you're upset.

37:00.801 --> 37:04.847
You seduce my friend?
You show up at my house?

37:04.931 --> 37:06.807
You've crossed the line, David.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.644
I get it. I get it.

37:11.687 --> 37:12.855
You wanna be discreet.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.777
-No one has to know about us.
-Us? There is no us!

37:17.860 --> 37:19.153
Would your husband think that?

37:19.528 --> 37:21.322
If you even think
about calling my husband--

37:21.405 --> 37:23.491
I'm not saying that I would, but I could.

37:27.411 --> 37:28.371
Come on, Ellie.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.458
Tell me that night didn't unlock
something inside of you.

37:33.167 --> 37:34.210
I mean, look at you.

37:35.294 --> 37:36.170
We did it!

37:38.756 --> 37:42.385
You know what? I've tried
to be considerate of your feelings

37:42.468 --> 37:44.345
and respectful of our friendship,

37:45.012 --> 37:46.347
but what is it gonna take?

37:47.807 --> 37:50.184
-For what?
-For you to stay away from me,

37:50.268 --> 37:52.270
my family, and Courtney.

37:53.604 --> 37:55.940
And make the same mistake
we made 20 years ago?

37:56.023 --> 37:57.525
David, the only mistake I made

37:57.608 --> 37:59.777
was getting caught up
in the moment that night.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.906
I am warning you, David.
You've gotta stay the hell--

38:03.990 --> 38:05.866
Who do you think
you're talking to, Deborah?

38:08.577 --> 38:09.829
Who the hell is Deborah?

38:12.456 --> 38:13.416
David?

38:14.750 --> 38:15.626
David.

38:18.796 --> 38:19.797
Look.

38:20.423 --> 38:21.424
Okay, listen.

38:22.675 --> 38:26.053
I know that we have had
some amazing memories in the past,

38:26.721 --> 38:29.056
and I am just asking you to please...

38:31.017 --> 38:32.727
let's leave the past

38:33.394 --> 38:34.353
where it is.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.939
This has got to stop.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.818
I need you to leave me alone.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.232
-[door code beeping]
-[door opens]

39:23.361 --> 39:24.195
[door closes]

39:33.371 --> 39:34.205
Hey.

39:35.581 --> 39:36.415
Hey.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.251
What's wrong?

39:44.298 --> 39:45.341
[Marcus] Mmm.

39:47.093 --> 39:48.094
[sniffles]

40:02.817 --> 40:04.819
He told me everything on the way home.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.113
So you basically just let me
sit through that whole dinner

40:07.196 --> 40:08.614
and make a fool out of myself.

40:08.697 --> 40:11.992
Courtney, that is not true.
I tried to tell you.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.077
Tell me what?

40:14.286 --> 40:16.372
David is unstable.

40:16.455 --> 40:17.998
Oh, he's unstable?

40:18.499 --> 40:20.751
You come on to him
in the middle of a nightclub,

40:20.835 --> 40:23.546
rip his clothes off in the bathroom,
but he's unstable?

40:23.796 --> 40:26.173
You then invite him to lunch,

40:26.257 --> 40:28.634
scream at him
in front of the entire restaurant,

40:28.717 --> 40:30.302
-but he's unstable?
-No, wait. I'm sorry.

40:30.386 --> 40:33.889
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What exactly did he tell you?

40:34.348 --> 40:35.182
The truth.

40:35.766 --> 40:38.853
How you wanted to have an affair
ever since Janice hired him,

40:38.936 --> 40:40.104
but he turned you down.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.565
How you've been trying to seduce him...

40:43.566 --> 40:45.943
ever since you found out I was seeing him.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.778
No, that is not true.

40:47.862 --> 40:51.365
You know me better than anyone.
I would never do that to you.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.409
Really? You wouldn't do that to me?

40:53.993 --> 40:54.869
Explain that.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.497
[Ellie gasps]

40:58.581 --> 40:59.874
Wait a minute, no.

41:01.167 --> 41:03.210
He sent these messages to me.

41:04.253 --> 41:07.673
He must have just switched the names.
[stammering] I didn't do that.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.759
You know,
he didn't even wanna show them to me

41:10.843 --> 41:14.054
because he knows what these would do
to your marriage if they ever got out.

41:14.138 --> 41:15.306
And you believe him.

41:15.764 --> 41:18.100
You actually believe the guy...

41:18.934 --> 41:23.105
who sat with us at dinner
and told us both that he was a hacker.

41:24.398 --> 41:27.860
If he wanted you to know so badly
that he and I were having an affair,

41:27.943 --> 41:30.070
why do you think
he waited so long to tell you?

41:30.154 --> 41:33.532
Because apparently, he's the only one
who cares about your marriage.

41:35.075 --> 41:37.286
I really don't know why I bothered
to even come down here.

41:37.369 --> 41:40.289
-Wait.
-Oh, my God. I'm... I'm just gonna go.

41:40.372 --> 41:41.332
-Courtney!
-No. No.

41:41.415 --> 41:43.083
Thanks for your complete honesty.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.753
-Really nice, Ellie. Really nice.
-Wait, Courtney.

41:45.836 --> 41:46.670
Listen to me.

41:47.588 --> 41:50.382
Are you telling me, right now,
that you really believe

41:50.841 --> 41:52.259
that there's nothing wrong?

41:52.843 --> 41:55.513
Oh, I definitely believe
there's something wrong here.

42:00.017 --> 42:03.145
Courtney, you're being ridiculous.
I would not lie to you.

42:03.979 --> 42:04.813
Courtney.

42:05.689 --> 42:06.524
Courtney!

42:08.108 --> 42:10.069
[car door shuts, engine turns over]

42:29.964 --> 42:30.965
[sighs]

42:37.346 --> 42:41.141
Linda, if anyone calls,
I'm heading into the city for a few hours.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.643
Uh, okay.

42:52.361 --> 42:56.156
But I need those papers on my desk
by Friday at 2:00 p.m., Desiree.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.783
[chuckles]

42:57.866 --> 42:59.868
-Oh, Ellie! Hi!
-Hi.

42:59.952 --> 43:01.412
[chuckling]

43:01.495 --> 43:02.329
How are you?

43:02.413 --> 43:04.456
-It's so good to see you.
-You too.

43:04.540 --> 43:05.624
Professor Nicole.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.918
I don't know that I'm ever
gonna be able to get past that.

43:08.002 --> 43:09.628
Oh, God. I can't believe
how good you look!

43:09.712 --> 43:11.880
What are you, hiding one
of those portraits in the attic?

43:11.964 --> 43:13.841
-What's your secret?
-I left the city.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.426
Yeah, that'll do it.

43:15.884 --> 43:18.345
Uh, Brittany told me about Marcus.
He's getting better?

43:18.429 --> 43:20.681
Yeah, he's doing good. Slowly but surely.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.808
-Thanks for asking.
-God, it's so funny you call.

43:22.891 --> 43:25.269
I was just going through old photos
for the retrospective.

43:25.352 --> 43:27.229
-Really?
-Yeah. What brings you up this way?

43:27.771 --> 43:29.231
Uh, David Hammond.

43:30.733 --> 43:31.567
What about him?

43:32.318 --> 43:34.778
A friend of mine is, uh, looking
for a consultant,

43:34.862 --> 43:36.864
and I knew you were friends.
And I was just wondering

43:36.947 --> 43:38.157
what you thought of him.

43:38.824 --> 43:40.743
I mean, I don't remember much.

43:40.826 --> 43:43.954
Just that he was smart,
kinda quiet though.

43:44.038 --> 43:46.832
Then, of course,
that he was totally obsessed with you.

43:46.999 --> 43:47.833
[chuckles]

43:47.916 --> 43:48.751
He was?

43:48.834 --> 43:51.503
Yeah, come on. Wait, you didn't notice?

43:52.129 --> 43:54.590
-[stammers] No, actually. No.
-[chuckles]

43:54.673 --> 43:55.841
Oh! That's right.

43:55.924 --> 43:58.093
Because you only had eyes for Marcus,

43:58.177 --> 44:00.679
all hot and sweaty
in his Stanford uniform.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.306
Well, yeah, that I remember.

44:02.389 --> 44:05.643
[chuckles] But you must remember
David's ex-wife, Deborah, right?

44:06.852 --> 44:09.980
No. I don't... I don't know
that I've... I've met Deborah.

44:10.898 --> 44:12.733
Really? She looked just like you.

44:13.984 --> 44:15.277
-Really?
-Yeah.

44:15.903 --> 44:17.863
So, why did they get a divorce?

44:19.365 --> 44:23.160
I... [sighs] I mean, look,
David was a nice guy, you know.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.870
Handsome, accomplished.

44:29.583 --> 44:30.751
But off the record...

44:32.419 --> 44:35.172
Deborah told me he had a crazy temper.

44:35.673 --> 44:38.634
And he was super controlling
and just crazy jealous.

44:42.137 --> 44:44.890
Wish... I wish I could hear
her side of the story.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.309
Ellie, she's dead.

44:47.685 --> 44:48.602
What?

44:49.019 --> 44:50.729
A couple months after the divorce,

44:50.813 --> 44:52.856
someone broke into
her new boyfriend's place,

44:52.940 --> 44:53.941
killed them both.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.484
Oh, my God.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.531
Was David ever considered a suspect?

45:00.989 --> 45:03.575
Oh, yeah, they investigated him,
of course.

45:03.659 --> 45:07.538
But, I mean, at the end of the day,
the police decided it was just a robbery.

45:07.830 --> 45:10.124
Apparently, the new boyfriend
was a dealer,

45:10.207 --> 45:12.334
had a bunch of cash
lying around the house.

45:13.252 --> 45:14.878
Ellie, what's this really about?

45:24.930 --> 45:26.390
Oh, my God.

45:54.835 --> 45:55.753
[beeping]

46:33.499 --> 46:34.750
[sniffing]

46:48.388 --> 46:49.515
[door code beeping]

47:13.664 --> 47:15.666
[sinister music playing]

47:24.925 --> 47:25.843
[creaking]

47:48.657 --> 47:50.367
[suspenseful music playing]

47:54.955 --> 47:56.957
[beeps]

48:12.681 --> 48:15.225
Courtney, hi, it's Ellie.
Please call me when you get this message.

48:15.309 --> 48:18.270
I have some information I think
you need to know. [breathes deeply]

48:18.353 --> 48:20.814
Call me on my cell.
I'll be in the office as well.

48:21.273 --> 48:22.983
All right. Bye. Love you.

48:25.068 --> 48:25.903
Come in.

48:25.986 --> 48:27.487
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, sweetie.

48:28.697 --> 48:29.740
You're up early.

48:29.823 --> 48:31.783
-Yeah, Scott's coming over.
-Oh, okay.

48:34.953 --> 48:37.706
-Is everything okay?
-Um, yeah.

48:38.498 --> 48:39.374
You know what?

48:40.584 --> 48:41.418
Give me a hug.

48:41.501 --> 48:42.461
Why? [chuckles]

48:42.878 --> 48:44.338
[sighs] I need it.

48:44.963 --> 48:45.923
[Brittany chuckles]

48:57.476 --> 48:58.727
-Morning.
-[Linda] Morning!

48:58.810 --> 49:00.646
-Any messages?
-[Linda] Your 10:30 confirmed.

49:00.729 --> 49:02.940
Okay. If Courtney calls,
pull me from whatever I'm doing.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.191
[Linda] Oh, no problem.

49:04.524 --> 49:06.652
And if this guy shows up, call the police.

49:07.235 --> 49:08.111
Sure.

49:08.195 --> 49:09.655
[phone beeps, vibrates]

49:15.285 --> 49:17.579
[Marcus] So the good news is
I'm finally starting to get

49:17.663 --> 49:20.040
some clients of my own
instead of just proofing.

49:20.123 --> 49:21.750
[Brittany] Hmm, that's great, Dad.

49:21.833 --> 49:24.086
[Marcus] Yeah. You remember
that job I did in Palo Alto?

49:26.630 --> 49:27.464
Babe?

49:28.423 --> 49:29.257
[Brittany] Mom?

49:30.008 --> 49:33.470
-You remember the job I did in Palo Alto?
-Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

49:33.553 --> 49:36.056
Well, it turns out
that guy bought some land here

49:36.139 --> 49:38.266
and wants me to design a building for him.

49:38.350 --> 49:39.643
[phone vibrates]

49:45.816 --> 49:47.025
That's amazing, honey.

49:48.110 --> 49:51.321
Yeah. Looks like things
might be finally turning around.

49:51.405 --> 49:52.572
[phone vibrates]

50:11.425 --> 50:12.801
Everything okay, Mom?

50:13.260 --> 50:14.636
Yeah, no. I'm, uh...

50:16.138 --> 50:17.055
Oh, I'll get it.

50:17.139 --> 50:18.432
No, no. I got it.

50:18.849 --> 50:19.725
[grunts]

50:22.686 --> 50:25.022
-You okay?
-Yeah, no, I'm fine. Um...

50:26.064 --> 50:28.400
I need to call my office. Be right back.

50:29.317 --> 50:30.736
[line ringing]

50:33.697 --> 50:34.531
[David] Hey.

50:35.741 --> 50:36.742
How did you get it?

50:38.910 --> 50:42.581
[David] Ellie, if I can break into
one of the top e-mail service providers

50:42.664 --> 50:43.832
in the country for you,

50:44.249 --> 50:46.501
I can definitely hack
into a nightclub for me.

50:47.169 --> 50:49.838
You give me one reason
why I shouldn't call the police

50:49.921 --> 50:51.339
and get a restraining order.

50:52.049 --> 50:56.219
Well, I wonder what would happen
if I sent that video to Marcus.

50:56.303 --> 51:00.515
I wonder what would happen if the world
knew what really happened to your ex-wife.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.560
I'm not giving up on us, Ellie.

51:04.269 --> 51:05.103
[phone beeps]

51:05.520 --> 51:06.354
David?

51:08.065 --> 51:08.899
David.

51:11.902 --> 51:12.944
Shit.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.072
[line ringing]

51:15.155 --> 51:17.532
[over recording] Hi! You've reached
Courtney. Leave a message.

51:17.616 --> 51:19.201
-[beeps]
-Courtney. It's Ellie.

51:19.284 --> 51:22.788
Please call me as soon as you get
this message. I need to talk to you.

51:28.293 --> 51:29.294
[door opens]

51:31.129 --> 51:31.963
[door slams]

52:06.414 --> 52:07.833
[sighs]

52:31.231 --> 52:32.232
So how was your day?

52:33.525 --> 52:34.359
It was great.

52:34.734 --> 52:35.777
[dings]

52:36.653 --> 52:37.487
[sighs]

52:40.532 --> 52:42.951
Oh, you're so sweet. Babe.

52:43.618 --> 52:44.494
What is it?

52:46.580 --> 52:47.414
[gasps]

52:48.248 --> 52:49.791
Oh, sexy.

52:51.168 --> 52:53.170
Sure you wouldn't rather see me in less?

52:53.628 --> 52:54.504
It's no rush.

52:56.047 --> 52:56.882
Okay.

52:58.049 --> 52:59.718
I guess I'll see you in a minute.

52:59.885 --> 53:00.802
[chuckles]

53:19.321 --> 53:20.322
[trash emptying]

53:29.497 --> 53:30.457
What do you think?

53:36.963 --> 53:37.797
Beautiful.

53:38.590 --> 53:39.424
Mmm.

53:44.012 --> 53:44.971
[Courtney grunts]

53:47.015 --> 53:49.684
[David] Tell me you love me.
-[moaning]

53:49.768 --> 53:53.188
-[David] You did all this time, tell me.
-[moaning] I love you.

53:54.397 --> 53:55.315
Yeah, I want you.

53:55.857 --> 53:57.400
[breathing heavily]

54:05.825 --> 54:06.660
I'm yours.

54:07.118 --> 54:08.078
[gasps]

54:08.161 --> 54:10.455
[breathing heavily]

54:11.414 --> 54:12.249
[moaning]

54:25.679 --> 54:27.097
[phone vibrating]

54:34.187 --> 54:35.188
[chuckling]

54:35.981 --> 54:36.815
Don't go.

54:39.067 --> 54:40.360
I'm gonna miss you.

54:40.568 --> 54:41.569
[chuckles]

54:42.112 --> 54:43.029
Yeah.

54:44.281 --> 54:45.115
Promise.

54:45.657 --> 54:47.075
Okay. See you later.

54:47.534 --> 54:48.702
-Call me.
-I will.

54:54.958 --> 54:56.376
[breathing heavily]

55:17.355 --> 55:18.440
[whispering] Oh, God.

55:50.847 --> 55:51.848
Hey, David.

55:56.519 --> 55:58.521
[indistinct chattering]

56:12.535 --> 56:14.454
[David] Hey. Hope you
weren't waiting long.

56:14.537 --> 56:16.873
[Marcus] Hey. No, man. Not at all.

56:17.248 --> 56:20.418
Gotta tell you, I was surprised
when I got your call this morning, man.

56:20.502 --> 56:23.213
I never thought I'd get a chance
to play this course. It's amazing.

56:23.296 --> 56:24.589
[David] You're gonna love it.

56:34.140 --> 56:35.225
[Marcus] There it is.

56:35.725 --> 56:36.643
[David] Good one.

56:37.227 --> 56:38.311
[Marcus] Thanks, man.

56:38.686 --> 56:40.063
Tell you, it's the putter.

56:40.146 --> 56:41.689
Thing damn near putts itself.

56:42.565 --> 56:44.776
Elle got it for me
for my birthday last year.

56:45.235 --> 56:47.237
She really seems like a great woman.

56:48.446 --> 56:49.906
I'd love to hear your secret.

56:50.198 --> 56:52.659
Well, I'll tell you.
A marriage counselor once told us

56:52.742 --> 56:54.828
that you have to approach marriage

56:54.911 --> 56:56.788
as a series of little marriages.

56:57.455 --> 56:58.957
So you two are in counseling?

56:59.457 --> 57:01.459
No, no. Not anymore. We were, but...

57:01.876 --> 57:03.253
that was before I got hurt.

57:04.129 --> 57:05.463
Mind if I ask what happened?

57:05.964 --> 57:09.467
No, no. Not at all.
I was riding my bike over Glen Canyon,

57:09.551 --> 57:10.760
like I do every morning.

57:10.844 --> 57:13.513
I must have veered off the road
or something, I'm not really sure,

57:13.596 --> 57:15.348
but I never saw or heard the truck.

57:16.224 --> 57:20.228
Week later, I woke up in the hospital,
broken collarbone, couple cracked ribs.

57:20.895 --> 57:22.730
I was in a body cast for six months.

57:23.106 --> 57:24.607
-Ouch.
-[Marcus] Yeah.

57:24.691 --> 57:25.900
It was tough at first.

57:25.984 --> 57:26.985
It's getting better.

57:29.446 --> 57:30.447
Everything is.

57:31.114 --> 57:31.948
[grunts]

57:33.074 --> 57:35.827
Work's great.
Things with Ellie are a lot better.

57:37.370 --> 57:38.371
You're a lucky guy.

57:38.663 --> 57:41.040
She's beautiful, successful.

57:47.630 --> 57:49.674
A lot of guys would kill
to have a woman like that.

57:49.757 --> 57:51.509
[chuckles] Thanks, man.

57:51.593 --> 57:52.510
I'm just saying.

57:53.303 --> 57:54.762
You have no idea what it's like

57:54.846 --> 57:57.432
to see the woman you love
touching another man,

57:57.849 --> 57:58.850
kissing another man,

57:59.642 --> 58:01.102
wondering if she really loves him.

58:01.644 --> 58:03.813
What you might do
if you got that man alone.

58:07.233 --> 58:10.361
Oh, hey, man.
Sorry to hear about your wife, too.

58:10.445 --> 58:12.280
Ex. Ex-wife.

58:12.906 --> 58:14.115
Yeah, well, either way.

58:17.410 --> 58:18.703
-Hey, there.
-Oh.

58:19.329 --> 58:20.163
How you doing?

58:24.250 --> 58:27.420
It was, man. It was good stuff, man.
I appreciate the call. Let's do it again.

58:27.504 --> 58:28.796
-Absolutely. We will.
-All right.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.389
-Hi.
-Hi. How can I help you?

59:19.472 --> 59:21.933
I'm not sure if you remember me
from this morning,

59:22.016 --> 59:24.644
but I'm a friend of, um, David Hammond's.

59:25.395 --> 59:28.898
Um, I left a few things
in his place last night.

59:28.982 --> 59:31.901
So, I was just wondering
if you could let me into his apartment.

59:38.533 --> 59:39.951
We've all had those nights.

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:40.762
[sighs]

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.823
[computers whirring]

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:20.677
[buzzes]

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:26.599
[beeps]

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:37.735
[breathing heavily]

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:42.740
[whispering] Oh, my God.

01:01:57.797 --> 01:01:59.507
No, no, no.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:02.927
[gasps]

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:30.246
[whimpers]

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.250
[phone vibrates]

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:39.213
Hey, babe.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.592
Golf was really fun. Yeah.

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:44.844
You on the way home from work?

01:02:46.345 --> 01:02:47.805
You want me to pick up some dinner?

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:49.682
[chuckles]

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.685
Okay. Headed to you right now.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:56.856
[door opens]

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:58.941
[door shuts]

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.985
[breathing heavily]

01:03:02.695 --> 01:03:04.071
[line ringing]

01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:07.033
Answer the phone. Courtney!

01:03:08.701 --> 01:03:10.995
You've got about ten seconds
until I hang up.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:13.623
Courtney, I think David killed his wife.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.042
That's not even remotely funny.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:18.211
Listen to me.
I know you are upset with me.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.463
And you have every right to be.

01:03:20.546 --> 01:03:23.299
But David is not the man
that you think he is.

01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:25.843
Everything from getting
the job at the firm

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:28.763
to dating you has all been to get to me.

01:03:29.263 --> 01:03:30.556
And you know this how?

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.475
Because I went to his apartment.

01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:34.477
He had pictures of me on his computer.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.728
He's been watching me.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:37.563
Courtney, he's dangerous.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:39.023
[knocking on door]

01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:39.941
I gotta go.

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:41.943
No, Courtney, please!

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.111
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

01:03:44.695 --> 01:03:45.530
Mwah.

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:52.495
So, who were you talking to?

01:03:53.037 --> 01:03:53.871
What's that?

01:03:54.288 --> 01:03:56.833
When I was coming down the hall,
I heard you talking to someone.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.253
Oh, uh, just a... a work call.
It was nothing. [chuckles]

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.462
Sounded pretty tense.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:04.382
You know how it is.
Some people don't know

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:07.426
-how to take no for an answer.
-[chuckles] Tell me about it.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:37.373
You shouldn't go through
other people's phones.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:40.543
What, why do you have
photos of Ellie on there?

01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:42.003
You know we're old friends.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:46.465
Yeah, but these are new.
Have you been following her?

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.011
-Janice asked me to do it.
-Her old boss?

01:04:50.094 --> 01:04:52.972
Yeah, she thought it was suspicious
Ellie was leaving the firm so soon,

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.850
so she asked me to make sure
she wasn't compromising anything.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.060
[stammers] Was she?

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.063
Was she compromising anything?

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:03.232
No.

01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.402
Yeah, I... I think I need some air.

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:07.320
[gasps]

01:05:10.656 --> 01:05:12.283
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:15.161
-[grunts]
-[buzzing]

01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:17.330
Courtney!

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.791
[door buzzes open]

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:32.595
Courtney.

01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:36.515
Courtney!

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:38.142
[breathing heavily]

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:48.819
[whispers] Oh, God.

01:05:49.070 --> 01:05:50.738
[gasping] Courtney!

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:53.616
Courtney.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.409
Courtney, wake up, please.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:56.702
Courtney.

01:05:57.036 --> 01:05:57.995
Oh, God.

01:05:58.704 --> 01:05:59.705
Somebody, help!

01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.833
[indistinct chattering]

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:05.461
[sniffles, sighs]

01:06:05.544 --> 01:06:08.923
We sent units to his apartment,
but he wasn't there. We'll find him.

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:10.675
Okay.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:13.260
[sniffles] Is she gonna be all right?

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.178
She's fine.

01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:15.096
Elle.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:16.764
Elle, are you okay?

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:19.517
Yeah, I'm okay, honey. [sniffles]

01:06:19.892 --> 01:06:22.353
-Where's Brittany?
-She's fine. She's with Scott.

01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:24.188
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes, yes.

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:25.481
You must be the husband.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:27.066
I'm Detective Larson.

01:06:27.149 --> 01:06:29.944
-Can you tell me what's going on?
-Her friend was attacked.

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:32.738
Attacked by who? What happened?

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:35.533
I'm gonna send a unit
to your house until we find him.

01:06:35.616 --> 01:06:38.077
In the meantime,
if you need anything, anytime.

01:06:38.452 --> 01:06:39.286
Thank you.

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:40.621
[sniffles]

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.457
Babe, what happened? What's going on?

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.543
I'm gonna tell you everything
when we get home.

01:06:45.626 --> 01:06:48.504
-But please, get me out of here, okay?
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.342
I mean, this guy's out here
drinking my beer.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:56.887
I played golf with this son of a bitch!

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.514
I don't get it.

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:02.893
I don't get it. If you guys were so close,
how come I never heard about him before?

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:07.273
I haven't talked to him
since I graduated from college.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:10.484
I haven't seen him
since we graduated from college.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.863
And when he showed up at the house,

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:16.949
I didn't know how...

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.243
I... I didn't know how to tell you.

01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:20.161
So, you...

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:22.580
you screw him in the bathroom?

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.540
Oh, I'm sorry, you almost did.

01:07:25.082 --> 01:07:25.916
I was drunk.

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.085
How do you do this to us, Elle?

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:32.757
I just got caught
in a situation, and I did not...

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.675
[whimpers, sighs]

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.302
I didn't know what to do.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:40.306
The last thing
that I ever wanted to do was hurt you.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.066
[sniffles]

01:07:54.862 --> 01:07:55.696
I'm sorry.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:59.075
If you were so upset
about the way things were going,

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.701
why didn't you say something?

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:04.705
Because I didn't know what to say.
I didn't know how to say it. I did not...

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:07.166
-I didn't know how to tell you anything.
-Elle!

01:08:10.127 --> 01:08:12.129
I don't understand
how you can make a living

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:15.508
talking to 12 people in a jury box
that you don't even know...

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:19.386
and you can't talk to me?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:22.223
I mean, Jesus,
is our life really that bad?

01:08:22.305 --> 01:08:23.140
No.

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:28.062
No, I love our life. I love our daughter.
I love the life that we've built together.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:29.604
I love you. I...

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:31.732
[sighs]

01:08:34.068 --> 01:08:35.152
[whispers] I'm sorry.

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:38.863
[door code beeping]

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.033
Mom.

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:44.328
Dad.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.581
-Why are there police cars outside?
-[sighs]

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:49.500
Come sit, baby.

01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:51.544
What's wrong?

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:54.046
Dad?

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:56.756
Just sit down.

01:09:19.446 --> 01:09:20.738
[groaning]

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:06.619
[electronic squeaking]

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.308
So, the use of an accelerant
is gonna make DNA tests very difficult,

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.394
and the dental samples
are gonna take a while to reconstruct.

01:10:34.271 --> 01:10:35.689
-Thank you.
-[Marcus] Mm-hmm.

01:10:36.023 --> 01:10:38.609
However, both the handwriting
on the letter

01:10:38.692 --> 01:10:41.654
and the clothing on the body
appear to be a match for David.

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:42.780
Yeah.

01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:49.286
We searched the apartment, and we
found the folders that you mentioned.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:52.831
There were also a number of searches
on the computer about suicide.

01:10:53.123 --> 01:10:56.627
Apparently, he left a message
on his therapist's voicemail last night,

01:10:57.127 --> 01:10:59.088
taking responsibility for everything...

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:02.007
including the murder of his ex-wife.

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:04.301
Oh, my God.

01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:09.431
I know this isn't
quite the resolution you were hoping for.

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:11.558
But it is a resolution.

01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:13.852
Yeah.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.399
[sighs] Um, thank you.
Thank you for everything you've done.

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.276
-We appreciate you.
-Thank you.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:21.986
Thanks. Thank you.

01:11:26.573 --> 01:11:27.449
Detective.

01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:32.496
How's Courtney? Is there an update?

01:11:32.579 --> 01:11:35.332
She's doing better.
I took her statement this morning.

01:11:35.416 --> 01:11:37.293
She's got stitches, a bad concussion,

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:40.212
but the doctor said she should be ready
to receive visitors tomorrow.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.047
[sighs] Thank you so much.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:49.471
[sighs]

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:54.518
Marcus, I'm sorry.

01:11:57.271 --> 01:11:58.605
I'm sorry for all of it.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.609
[Marcus] You know, I remember...

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:07.364
the first day that I realized
I was in love with you.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:13.245
It was like, in that moment,
everything just...

01:12:15.247 --> 01:12:16.206
made sense.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:24.131
I can't tell you that I'm not angry.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.384
And I can't tell you that I'm not hurt.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:32.890
But what I can say is...

01:12:34.266 --> 01:12:35.768
that I will always need you...

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:38.896
for my world to make sense.

01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:43.650
So...

01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:48.947
I told you before, I'll tell you again,

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:52.201
I guess you're stuck with me.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.331
I think we're stuck with each other.

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:18.602
[sighs]

01:13:24.316 --> 01:13:25.734
[both chuckling]

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.237
-Good catch.
-[chuckles]

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.366
[newscaster] Low coastal clouds will be
rolling in later tomorrow afternoon...

01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:33.951
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:39.456
Look at this.

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.250
It's perfect.

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:42.668
[chuckling]

01:13:44.002 --> 01:13:46.380
There's no way
I'm going in to the office today.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:47.506
Don't.

01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:49.800
You know?

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:54.012
We have so much to be thankful for.

01:13:55.055 --> 01:13:56.598
I know what I'm thankful for.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.186
You want some tea?

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.355
-Yeah.
-All right, I'll get some.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:08.110
...after murdering his ex-wife
and her boyfriend,

01:14:08.193 --> 01:14:11.655
as well as stalking
an Oceancrest woman and her family.

01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:20.372
David is a textbook definition

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:23.167
of narcissistic personality disorder.

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:35.888
All right, guys. We gotta get that thing
in first thing in the morning, all right?

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:36.805
Eight hours.

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:37.723
Stick it full.

01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:38.849
[phone dings]

01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:40.976
Oh, shoot.

01:14:42.352 --> 01:14:45.439
It's Linda. I need to go to the office
and sign some documents

01:14:45.522 --> 01:14:46.482
before the holiday.

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.817
-It's almost dark.
-No, I know. I'll be quick.

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:49.818
All right.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.237
-Bye, guys. Have fun.
-[Brittany] Bye.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.741
-Bring us a pizza. We're hungry.
-I will.

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:58.994
-Hey, don't make me come down there now.
-[chuckles]

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:27.814
Linda, I'm here!

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:33.111
[sighs]

01:15:58.512 --> 01:15:59.680
[gasps, grunts]

01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:05.060
[screams, gasping]

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:15.404
[phone vibrating]

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.115
No. No.

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.493
[David] You left them alone.

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:23.245
[whispers] Oh, David.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:25.497
[breathing heavily]

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.169
[phone ringing]

01:16:32.754 --> 01:16:34.131
This is Detective Larson.

01:16:34.464 --> 01:16:36.717
David is still alive.

01:16:37.217 --> 01:16:38.760
Ellie? Slow down.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.095
Where are you now?

01:16:40.512 --> 01:16:43.265
I'm in my car. I'm driving to my house.

01:16:43.348 --> 01:16:44.349
No one's answering.

01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:47.519
[crying] Please.
Get someone over there now.
