WEBVTT

00:00.348 --> 00:02.437
Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:02.437 --> 00:04.221
As you guys know,
I'’ve been struggling.

00:04.221 --> 00:06.789
So I made a decision
to leave the boat.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.618
It'’ll be here when
you get back.

00:09.618 --> 00:12.664
Gigi Fernandez is a two-time
Olympic gold medalist

00:12.664 --> 00:15.015
who was an International
Tennis Hall of Fame

00:15.015 --> 00:18.235
and has won
17 Grand Slam titles.

00:20.759 --> 00:23.545
Are you kidding me?
We'’re professionals at this.

00:23.545 --> 00:26.635
I'’m going to decide who's
on anchor watch from 12 til 8.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.506
We really like to
go to bed, like, early.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.552
I know. The captain
has made the schedule

00:30.552 --> 00:32.119
and asked for us to do
the schedule.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.164
That pisses me off.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.993
Everybody'’s literally
is like, she'’s so lazy.

00:36.993 --> 00:38.777
Like, can she please
pick up the pace?

00:38.777 --> 00:41.084
Cause you'’re slow enough
and I don'’t--

00:41.084 --> 00:43.086
Slow?
Are you----ing kidding me.

00:43.086 --> 00:46.220
I'’m going as fast as I can.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.482
We need somebody faster.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.745
Okay, then you----ing do it.

01:20.254 --> 01:22.169
- Oh, good morning.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.304
- Morning.
- Hi, good morning.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.958
- How are you doing?
- I'’m doing well.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.699
Could you turn
laundry over for me?

01:30.699 --> 01:31.700
Yes, of course.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.138
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.444
Look'’s good, huh?

01:36.444 --> 01:37.880
Oh, God.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.186
I'’m going to get so fat.

01:39.186 --> 01:41.710
Good morning. How are you?

01:41.710 --> 01:44.234
Hayley, can I leave you
on the service please?

01:44.234 --> 01:45.453
We'’ve got the primaries up.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.629
Were you in the rolling
World Olympics?

01:47.629 --> 01:50.284
- Fold Olympics?
- No.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.851
You wonder why
baskets are like this normally?

01:52.851 --> 01:54.810
They don'’t condensate
when they'’re steaming,

01:54.810 --> 01:57.204
- when they'’re hot.
- Oh, that makes sense.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.814
Mother----ing fun fact!

01:58.814 --> 02:00.555
I'’ve not got an ass.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.992
You know what'’s really funny is
I got prescribed something.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.080
I'’m sure you did.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.648
Yeah, it'’s called no-ass-at-all.

02:06.648 --> 02:07.518
Jesus Christ.

02:07.518 --> 02:08.606
Did you see the gold medals?

02:08.606 --> 02:09.825
- No.
- Do you want to see them?

02:09.825 --> 02:11.087
I'’d love to.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.567
Let me get them.
I'’ll be right back.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.177
- I'’d absolutely love to.
<i>- Ross, Ross, Fraser.</i>

02:14.177 --> 02:15.439
<i>May I see you in
my office, please?</i>

02:19.791 --> 02:21.097
So this change in the schedule,

02:21.097 --> 02:22.968
like, I have a big
issue with that.

02:22.968 --> 02:25.928
This is the new watch schedule
and you have eight until

02:25.928 --> 02:28.235
two in the morning.

02:28.235 --> 02:31.151
- This is such sh--.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
I always work out in
main deck aft,

02:33.153 --> 02:34.502
but I do it at
three in the morning.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.199
So there is no one
it'’s just me there.

02:36.199 --> 02:40.160
So it'’s perfect but now because
she want me to work until late,

02:40.160 --> 02:42.727
it means that I have to work out
in the day.

02:48.777 --> 02:52.476
Oh my... wow.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.217
- That'’s heavy.
- It is.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.132
- That is amazing.
- Kind of cool to bring them up.

02:56.132 --> 02:58.134
Okay so these are the details
we'’ve got for today.

02:58.134 --> 03:01.746
They'’re going to have their
tennis match on this court.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.792
So we need to find the most
beautiful tennis court

03:03.792 --> 03:05.228
on the island tomorrow

03:05.228 --> 03:07.796
for a tennis and
tequila doubles match

03:07.796 --> 03:10.842
and maybe even host...
like do a little lunch there?

03:10.842 --> 03:12.975
We do have the landing.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.194
They will more
than love to host.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.804
Fantastic.

03:15.804 --> 03:18.328
And then we'’ll walk them to
lunch for at latest 3:00.

03:18.328 --> 03:19.547
Thank you so much.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.591
Thank you.

03:20.591 --> 03:21.897
- Just scrambled egg, yeah?
- Yep.

03:24.856 --> 03:26.989
Specials today we'’ve
got a truffle mushroom

03:26.989 --> 03:28.643
and shallots omelet.

03:28.643 --> 03:29.992
Whatever she'’s making,
I'’ll have.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.428
Exactly.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.821
Can I just have that
special with egg whites, though?

03:32.821 --> 03:35.171
You absolutely can.

03:35.171 --> 03:37.129
Ow!

03:37.129 --> 03:38.392
That one really hurt.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.655
I'’m going to do
two of your special,

03:40.655 --> 03:43.397
- but with just egg whites.
- Yeah.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.790
Guests request an afternoon
of tennis and tequila.

03:45.790 --> 03:48.619
We'’re going to have two deck
and two interior present.

03:48.619 --> 03:51.013
Those two people on deck are
going to be Ben and yourself.

03:51.013 --> 03:53.233
Hi, ladies.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.192
Normal special with egg yolk.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.802
- Oh, my gosh.
- Right?

03:57.802 --> 04:00.501
Oh.

04:00.501 --> 04:01.806
It looks good in here.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.721
I really needed that.
I appreciate that.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.115
Oh, yeah.

04:06.115 --> 04:07.682
Heavy!

04:07.682 --> 04:08.596
Is that it?

04:08.596 --> 04:11.338
- I think so.
- Okay, perfect.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.861
So it'’s going to be full
of drinking ice.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.864
That'’s drinking ice, yeah.
Love that.

04:17.082 --> 04:18.258
Really again?

04:19.998 --> 04:20.912
Jesus.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.525
- We good?
- Yeah, we'’re good.

04:24.525 --> 04:26.178
Don'’t worry. I got it.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.789
So just so you know, girls.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.573
Don'’t put that in here.
You have to put it...

04:29.573 --> 04:31.662
- Excuse me.
- You can'’t put broken glass

04:31.662 --> 04:33.708
- in here, we'’ve had talks--
- Okay. All right. My bad.

04:33.708 --> 04:36.972
My bad. I wasn'’t present
for that conversation.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.190
Where do you go, the ocean?

04:38.190 --> 04:39.583
There'’s... no, boo.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.193
Glass can go in the ocean.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.195
I know, but we'’re not
going to toss it off the yacht.

04:43.195 --> 04:45.720
There'’s... under the bar,
there'’s like a...

04:45.720 --> 04:47.330
- God.
- What'’s wrong with you?

04:47.330 --> 04:49.071
Like, do you want to
know where to put it?

04:49.071 --> 04:51.639
There'’s a cardboard box so
it doesn'’t cut through any bags.

04:51.639 --> 04:52.553
Sorry.

04:52.553 --> 04:53.858
Okay. While you'’re both here

04:53.858 --> 04:55.556
okay, very quickly.
I'’ve got to go.

04:55.556 --> 04:56.992
- So listen up.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.603
So we'’ve got a list
of things to do Alissa,

04:59.603 --> 05:02.563
she'’s going to be doing
all of preparation for lunch.

05:02.563 --> 05:05.740
Also, you look very
beautiful right now.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.090
Thank you.
Stop looking at me.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.309
Darling, girl...

05:10.527 --> 05:11.920
I do want you
to turn over laundry,

05:11.920 --> 05:13.530
but that should
take no time whatsoever.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.315
We just want smiles
and just hard work.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.359
Yep. Cool.

05:16.359 --> 05:17.795
How is everyone?

05:17.795 --> 05:20.058
How do you know what
flavors will go together?

05:20.058 --> 05:22.278
You go to chef school?

05:22.278 --> 05:23.801
Want to see
the gold medals?

05:23.801 --> 05:25.716
Yeah, I do, actually.
That'’s really, really cool.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.763
It'’s exactly the weight that
you would think it would be.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.112
You know,
the thing with the gold medal

05:30.112 --> 05:31.809
is like everybody follows
the Olympics.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.768
Like, I can come home
and win the French Wimbledon,

05:33.768 --> 05:35.726
and the US Open
all in the same summer,

05:35.726 --> 05:37.554
and I go home
and no one said anything,

05:37.554 --> 05:38.947
and then I come home and win

05:38.947 --> 05:40.601
one gold medal
and everybody'’s like,

05:40.601 --> 05:42.254
Oh my God,
you won a gold medal?

05:42.254 --> 05:43.430
It is amazing, isn'’t it?

05:43.430 --> 05:44.822
Tony, come on.
What are you doing?

05:44.822 --> 05:46.824
Where are you from, my friend?
Costa Rica?

05:46.824 --> 05:49.261
Costa Rica.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.394
They can chat another day.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.917
<i>Tony, Tony, Fraser.</i>

05:52.917 --> 05:55.180
Okay, I will see you there.
They'’re waiting for me.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.486
It'’s you that's going to
be with me, right?

05:56.486 --> 05:58.053
I am, yeah.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.490
Okay, let'’s go ahead and
start making that list now.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.100
<i>Camille, Alissa.</i>

06:02.100 --> 06:03.101
What do you want, bitch?

06:03.101 --> 06:04.538
<i>Go ahead.</i>

06:04.538 --> 06:06.801
Can you meet me in the upper
stew pantry, please?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.455
<i>Give me a couple of seconds.</i>

06:08.455 --> 06:10.239
<i>I'’m working on all
the cabins downstairs.</i>

06:10.239 --> 06:12.067
Hey, what do you have going on?

06:12.067 --> 06:14.591
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.114
Um, gym, day heads.

06:16.114 --> 06:18.900
I'’m going to take this and
vacuum guest areas.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.772
Okay, because I had a talk
with her last night.

06:21.772 --> 06:25.167
Now, I know the lack
of effort on her part.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.386
Yes.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.387
Do you want to be
on this boat?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.953
- Yes.
- Okay.

06:28.953 --> 06:33.175
So if I do my job, you'’re going
to want to do your job

06:33.175 --> 06:35.003
because how hard I work. Right?

06:35.003 --> 06:36.483
It'’s true.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.223
You'’re going to get
the same thing from them.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.703
- Right.
- If you work hard.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.444
It'’s not even the lack of effort.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.706
It'’s really the attitude.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.360
She has a very nasty attitude.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.276
Every single night I'’m with her,
I feel that I'’m very...

06:47.276 --> 06:50.235
Like, I just don'’t like that.
I'’m a hard worker.

06:50.235 --> 06:54.065
I don'’t mind picking up slack.
I don'’t mind that.

06:54.065 --> 06:57.155
But the attitude is ridiculous.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.243
So today she gave you attitude?

06:58.243 --> 06:59.636
Yes.

06:59.636 --> 07:02.509
Hearing Alissa crying
talking about Camille

07:02.509 --> 07:04.772
is really disappointing.

07:04.772 --> 07:07.035
As a captain,
I just stepped on this vessel.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.733
I personally want
to observe that first

07:09.733 --> 07:11.953
and not take a crew
member'’s word for it.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.389
I need to watch Camille.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.956
So she'’s on my radar.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.393
What if she was removed
out of interior?

07:17.393 --> 07:19.047
Would that help?

07:19.047 --> 07:23.051
I feel like five deck versus
three interior is not...

07:23.051 --> 07:24.922
It'’s not going to work
for this boat.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.098
Yeah. I'’m sorry
you'’re going through that.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.535
I will take care of it.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.233
Thank you.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.539
Adorable.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.279
Do we really need
two gazebos?

07:34.279 --> 07:36.934
I think Fraser wants two.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.589
Captain, would it be
okay to work with Camille

07:39.589 --> 07:41.809
to start getting the jetskis in?

07:41.809 --> 07:44.115
Is that okay?
Thank you very much.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.377
<i>Camille, Camille, Ross.</i>

07:45.377 --> 07:46.378
<i>Meet me in the laz.</i>

07:46.378 --> 07:47.597
Literally doing everything.

07:47.597 --> 07:48.772
I'’d be honored.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.600
Man, I'’m sweaty
already, bro.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.602
- Hectic morning, hasn'’t it?
- Yeah.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.433
He'’ll also need bowls
as well...

07:57.433 --> 07:59.261
- Yeah.
- For the shells.

07:59.261 --> 08:00.741
- Okay.
- Cool, copy.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.307
<i>- Fraser, Fraser, Ross.
- You'’re good.</i>

08:02.307 --> 08:05.920
<i>We'’re just departing
the main vessel now.</i>

08:05.920 --> 08:07.922
When people ask you
to do something,

08:07.922 --> 08:10.577
don'’t have a fresh mouth, okay?

08:10.577 --> 08:12.230
- Right.
- You get me?

08:12.230 --> 08:14.755
Yeah. Call Alissa and
let her know that Ross

08:14.755 --> 08:16.974
just asked you to do
the wave runners.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.149
Alissa, Camille.

08:18.149 --> 08:19.455
<i>Go for Alissa.</i>

08:19.455 --> 08:22.110
Ross just asked me
to do the wave runners.

08:22.110 --> 08:23.720
<i>Okay, copy that.</i>

08:23.720 --> 08:26.810
We need way more help on the
interior than they do on deck.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.333
- I agree.
- That would not be fair.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.639
Especially with the new captain.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.336
There'’s enough stress
to go around.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.599
- Hey.
- Yes, ma'’am?

08:32.599 --> 08:34.557
I want you to apologize
to Alissa.

08:34.557 --> 08:36.559
- For what exactly?
- For your...

08:36.559 --> 08:38.039
Tone?

08:38.039 --> 08:40.737
She does not give a [bleep].
She doesn'’t care.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.913
It'’s hard when you're
being told what to do,

08:42.913 --> 08:44.393
but that'’s your job.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.482
Everyone seems to be getting
really upset by it.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.440
Come on, you want to be
a team player.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.052
Doesn'’t have to be hard.

08:51.052 --> 08:52.532
Coming up...

08:54.229 --> 08:55.273
Wait, seriously?

08:55.273 --> 08:56.492
What is it?

08:56.492 --> 08:58.233
- Help, help, help, help.
- Holy sh--.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.539
He'’s coming.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.892
- Hey.
- Yes, ma'’am.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.415
I want you to apologize
to Alissa.

09:06.415 --> 09:08.591
Sometimes I'’m sorry,
and sometimes I'’m not.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.158
Well, you need to be.

09:10.158 --> 09:12.595
It'’s hard when you're
being told what to do,

09:12.595 --> 09:14.336
but that'’s your job.

09:14.336 --> 09:15.903
I'’m not disagreeing with the
fact that I have an attitude.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.774
I'’m proud of my attitude.

09:17.774 --> 09:20.385
Thank----ing God I have some
type of '’tude in this world.

09:20.385 --> 09:21.648
You want to be a team player.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.040
- I know.
- Okay?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.912
It doesn'’t have to be hard.

09:24.912 --> 09:27.262
I will apologize to Alissa

09:27.262 --> 09:31.048
because I have to play that game
so that I don'’t get fired.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.354
I don'’t want to get fired.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.616
I'’ll apologize.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.576
- I have faith in you.
- Sincerely.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.229
It'’s so----ing stupid.

09:38.229 --> 09:40.536
And just bite my tongue.

09:40.536 --> 09:43.017
See? Mommy, I can do this.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.281
You got this.
I'’m not worried about you.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.197
Ah, this is amazing.

09:49.197 --> 09:52.330
<i>Fraser. Fraser
all guests are on their way.</i>

09:52.330 --> 09:53.941
Oh, my gosh.

09:53.941 --> 09:55.638
Slutty boiling, isn'’t it?

09:55.638 --> 09:57.161
I think I'’m going to die.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.425
Honestly, Ginger, people
do not work well in the sun.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.905
Join a superyacht, they said.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.733
Have a glamorous lifestyle.

10:03.733 --> 10:07.345
More like have a canker
in a sweaty tit rash.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.131
This is why you'’re so tan, you
get to hang out in this all day.

10:10.131 --> 10:13.613
I'’m honestly translucent.
I'’m melting.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.266
I'’m pretty much going to evaporate.

10:15.266 --> 10:18.487
Too hot for a ginger person. Lethal.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.924
Oh, that water is my life.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.753
- Good morning.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

10:23.753 --> 10:25.886
How nice of you.
Thank you.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.409
<i>Alissa, Camille.</i>

10:27.409 --> 10:29.846
<i>- Go for Alissa.
- What'’s your location?</i>

10:29.846 --> 10:31.282
Galley with Rachel.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.457
Hey.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.941
- So do I just throw it?
- Yeah.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.160
Just start, whack it.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.292
That'’s it.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.253
Ugh!

10:48.038 --> 10:49.649
Sh--.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.738
Right in the gonads.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.175
Straight down,
camera on the floor.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.264
!

10:56.264 --> 10:57.439
Are you okay, bro?

10:57.439 --> 10:59.093
I think that'’s game.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.836
I can rub it for you
if you want.

11:02.836 --> 11:06.013
So I really just
wanted to apologize

11:06.013 --> 11:10.321
and take full responsibility
for my actions.

11:10.321 --> 11:14.935
And I don'’t want you to have
to walk around this boat

11:14.935 --> 11:19.243
and feel like there'’s
animosity and unwelcomed.

11:19.243 --> 11:22.943
And I just wanted
to apologize to you and...

11:22.943 --> 11:25.859
and really try to move forward
on a real positive note.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.731
I really, really,
really appreciate the apology

11:28.731 --> 11:30.559
and just you
taking responsibility.

11:30.559 --> 11:33.214
The only thing is now
I'’m looking for the actions.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.911
- Right?
- You know what I mean?

11:34.911 --> 11:36.217
- Totally get that.
- You feel me?

11:36.217 --> 11:37.827
I mean, that'’s part of it.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.394
Our whole team'’s
busting their ass,

11:39.394 --> 11:42.614
and your ass
is ready for a spanking now.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.487
<i>- Fraser, Fraser.
- Go ahead.</i>

11:45.487 --> 11:46.880
<i>We are on our way.</i>

11:46.880 --> 11:49.447
Okay, guys, ready?
One, two and three.

11:49.447 --> 11:50.797
Cheese.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.363
Do you know,
we are collecting memories.

11:59.631 --> 12:00.632
Nice, Jane.

12:00.632 --> 12:01.895
Out.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.767
Rafa, are you going to play it?

12:04.767 --> 12:05.942
I can have a go.

12:07.248 --> 12:08.423
You ready?

12:08.423 --> 12:10.120
Let'’s go.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.779
Yes.

12:16.779 --> 12:20.043
- Oi!
- Woo!

12:20.043 --> 12:22.219
I'’m not so bad
with a racket and ball.

12:22.219 --> 12:24.265
I do look like Rafael Nadal
though, but I wouldn'’t

12:24.265 --> 12:26.093
challenge him to a
match, tell you that much.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.837
Out!

12:30.837 --> 12:32.012
Come on, Rafa.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.797
Wait he'’s... oh, that's out.

12:34.797 --> 12:37.452
All right, 1-0.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.674
I think she noticed that I was
getting a little bit cocky.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.372
Get it, get up there.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.417
She just got, all right, mate,
I'’ll put you back in your spot.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.202
Sit down.

12:48.202 --> 12:51.683
- Oh, no.
- That was an easy.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.555
It'’s easy to get things done
when there'’s no guest on board,

12:53.555 --> 12:55.296
you know?

12:55.296 --> 12:57.515
I can'’t. Sorry, I can't darling.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.082
- Thank you.
- We'’re toasting you.

12:59.082 --> 13:01.128
Thanks.
I know.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.434
- Appreciate that.
- I tried, I tried.

13:03.434 --> 13:04.653
Yeah. Ben distracts me.

13:04.653 --> 13:05.697
I know.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.612
Like, where the [bleep] is Ben?

13:07.612 --> 13:08.962
- Crew mess.
- With me.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.093
You'’re next to me
all the time, so...

13:10.093 --> 13:11.921
I make sure of that.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.451
I'’m glad
you like them.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.672
Today for lunch we have
a tomahawk bone-in rib eye

13:23.672 --> 13:27.284
that has been encrusted
with a balsamic reduction

13:27.284 --> 13:30.897
along with king crab legs
that have been steamed.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.856
And then you have
salsa, guacamole,

13:33.856 --> 13:35.466
serrano chile, sour cream.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.554
Amazing.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.643
How can you turn down
a tomahawk?

13:38.643 --> 13:39.949
That is so good.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.864
- It is like butter.
- Amazing.

13:56.183 --> 13:58.359
Oh, that'’s----ing
hilarious.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.536
That'’s where I want to be
right now, with them.

14:01.536 --> 14:03.886
- Your carriage has arrived.
- Our chariot!

14:03.886 --> 14:05.714
Can we take this with us?

14:05.714 --> 14:07.020
Take her and shake her.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.022
Just make sure
you don'’t break her.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.762
- Thank you!
- Bye!

14:10.762 --> 14:11.981
Bye!

14:18.770 --> 14:20.120
Whoa!

14:26.082 --> 14:27.301
- Hi there.
- This is where it happens?

14:27.301 --> 14:29.564
This is where the fun is.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.392
- Just going to finish cabins.
- Fabulous.

14:31.392 --> 14:34.134
Well, we'’re going to do
is just one step, okay?

14:36.005 --> 14:38.094
Go on in.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.928
Wait, seriously?

14:45.928 --> 14:46.929
What is it?

14:46.929 --> 14:48.061
Help, help, help.

14:48.061 --> 14:50.672
What is going on?

14:50.672 --> 14:52.195
Go, Tony.
He'’s going, he's going.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.936
He'’s coming.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.938
Oh, my goodness.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.200
Holy sh--.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.382
Help, help, help, help.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.688
- Go, Tony.
- He'’s going, he's going.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.170
Holy sh--.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.086
He'’s coming.

15:13.086 --> 15:15.349
- Oh, my goodness gracious.
- Oh my God.

15:16.611 --> 15:18.004
Jeez.

15:18.004 --> 15:20.093
I bet many people would like
to be rescued like that.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.746
I know. Exactly.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.533
Serious?

15:25.533 --> 15:27.752
Oh, my gosh.

15:27.752 --> 15:30.146
You should shower.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.582
- It won'’t?
- Oh, vinegar.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.412
Yes, can you come pee on me?

15:35.412 --> 15:36.631
This is just straight vinegar.

15:36.631 --> 15:37.849
Okay, great.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.416
When people are struggling
in the water,

15:39.416 --> 15:42.419
things spiral in a second.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.204
No, they just sting, unfortunately.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.379
Oh my God.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.729
The deck team are on it.

15:47.729 --> 15:48.730
Nice work, everyone.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.340
We have the A-Team.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.429
Who knew that the Pitons were
going to be so entertaining.

15:52.429 --> 15:56.042
We will do the tamarind sauce
and they'’re going to have

15:56.042 --> 15:58.044
mango chutney chapati.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.394
Tonight, I have
an Indian dinner.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.439
It'’s going to be epic
because I love Indian food.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.789
And I studied in India,
and I spent a lot of time there.

16:04.789 --> 16:06.095
And then poppadom.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.836
I study nutrition and I know why

16:07.836 --> 16:11.448
they use ingredients that
they use like cumin, paprika,

16:11.448 --> 16:15.191
and mustard, these are digestive
ingredients for gut health.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.019
- Raita masala will come out.
- Yeah.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.500
Hence the fact that you'’re
going to be farting your ass off

16:19.500 --> 16:21.589
and feeling a little bloated
if you don'’t do it right.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.852
Then I'’m going to
do aloo gobi.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.724
Jesus Christ, that'’s
a lot of food.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.117
Good!

16:28.117 --> 16:29.814
Let me get this stuff
out of here for you.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.512
Thank you. After you
take that back,

16:31.512 --> 16:33.993
then come back
to finish your silver.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.472
- Sounds good.
- Thank you.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.866
Whoo. My feet be hurting.

16:37.866 --> 16:40.260
Babe, are you on service too?

16:40.260 --> 16:41.435
No, I'’m not.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.002
Are you on deck right now?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.134
I'’m in the kitchen
just doing dishes.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.483
Sh--, me, too.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.703
Do you want to jump on it
or push it in?

16:48.703 --> 16:50.313
Are you okay?
Do you need a minute?

16:50.313 --> 16:52.446
I'’m going to have to shower
for sure.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.756
- Captain.
- What'’s up?

16:58.756 --> 17:00.019
This is nice.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.151
- Yeah, it'’s nice.
- You like this set up?

17:02.151 --> 17:03.935
I mean, yeah.

17:03.935 --> 17:05.937
I was just checking in, just
wanting to come get a breather.

17:05.937 --> 17:07.417
I figured it was quiet in here.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.506
Why don'’t you get some rest
while you can?

17:09.506 --> 17:11.378
Captain Sandy,
every time I turn the corner,

17:11.378 --> 17:12.944
somebody'’s tasking me.

17:12.944 --> 17:15.512
Good. You need to be
tasked really hard.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.950
So you adjust the attitude.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.736
I think Tony wants to
talk to you about his time.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.825
- Nobody'’s had a break today.
- I know.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.087
Where'’s Camille?

17:25.087 --> 17:26.523
She'’s got to take these
out of the galley.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.047
Think I can go to shower?

17:28.047 --> 17:30.919
I guess you guys are
probably safe for showering.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.312
Camille, Camille, Rachel.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.617
Go ahead, Rachel.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.315
Hey, Camille, are you able
to come back

17:35.315 --> 17:37.969
and finish the silverware?

17:37.969 --> 17:39.884
<i>Captain Sandy sent me
for a 30 minute break,</i>

17:39.884 --> 17:41.451
and then I'’ll be back
and I'’ll finish all of it

17:41.451 --> 17:42.887
and get it out of your way.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.324
<i>Okay, I don'’t know
where to put it.</i>

17:44.324 --> 17:45.847
Where should I put it
out of the way?

17:45.847 --> 17:48.719
Dude, figure it out.
You'’re like 35 years old.

17:48.719 --> 17:50.721
Hey, Camille,
don'’t throw me under the bus.

17:50.721 --> 17:54.638
I just said you can take a
break if you'’re not needed.

17:54.638 --> 17:57.554
I see. Sorry,
I didn'’t understand it that way.

17:57.554 --> 17:58.773
Thank you, Captain.

17:58.773 --> 17:59.904
That'’s okay.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.080
That'’s a 10-4.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.039
This is awkward as [bleep].

18:04.039 --> 18:06.563
What the [bleep]? She'’s not
my----ing department head.

18:06.563 --> 18:09.000
I'’m going to lose
my sh--, dude.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.132
I'’m gonna lose it.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.177
What just happened?

18:11.177 --> 18:13.179
That was the----ing captain.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.398
Yo, she'’s stupid.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.617
Oh my God.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.401
It was all over the
- ing radio.

18:18.401 --> 18:19.794
What the [bleep]?

18:19.794 --> 18:21.926
I can'’t.
It'’s not how I understood it.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.972
The captain tells me
I can take a break.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.191
I have to literally report

18:25.191 --> 18:26.583
to every----ing person
on this boat.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.151
to have a minute?
Dude, I can'’t.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.544
I can'’t do it anymore.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.762
What just happened?

18:31.762 --> 18:34.417
Did Sandy call out her
or Rachel?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.158
- No, Sandy called out her.
- Her.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.160
All right, we'’re gonna go hang
out with that----ing weird

18:38.160 --> 18:41.163
redhead chick in----ing galley
and wash her----ing dishes.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.295
I just want to say hello.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.775
- Hi.
- 8:30 is fine for dinner?

18:44.775 --> 18:46.386
Can'’t even think right now.

18:46.386 --> 18:47.909
Is Captain Sandy
joining, or...

18:47.909 --> 18:49.780
Captain Sandy'’s
also joining you.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.608
Yay!

18:51.608 --> 18:54.350
I'’m sorry for that.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.091
- Are you crying?
- I am.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.267
Because I did not want to
throw you under the bus.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.661
That was not my intention whatsoever.

19:00.661 --> 19:02.837
I don'’t know, I just feel like

19:02.837 --> 19:04.708
I'’m doing all the bitch work
all the time.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.188
When you were hired,
why were you hired as?

19:06.188 --> 19:09.452
A deck stew, but interior
seems to be the one

19:09.452 --> 19:11.106
who has the weaker links.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.542
Being between interior and deck.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.501
That is not easy.
You don'’t have a schedule.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.764
You don'’t know
who'’s calling you.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.592
So that'’s where
she gets my grace.

19:18.592 --> 19:20.463
Someone needs to make
your schedule.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.204
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So you need a schedule.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.205
Needs to be on the bridge.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.511
Okay.

19:24.511 --> 19:26.513
But what I need from her
now is to see that

19:26.513 --> 19:27.557
she really wants to be there.

19:27.557 --> 19:28.993
She has to be in it to win it.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.995
It'’s too pretty out here
to be feeling like this.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.301
I'’m really sorry.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.347
No, don'’t be sorry.
We'’ll figure it out.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.478
Just hold it together.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.653
- I will.
- Keep doing your work.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.828
I will.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.090
Please don'’t do
the fresh mouth thing.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.789
- No, ma'’am, I will not.
- Okay. Thanks.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.010
Of course you can.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.186
I'’ll be very quick.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.230
Is she making
loads of curries?

19:48.230 --> 19:49.449
There'’s a few.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.972
I won'’t be able
to deal with this

19:50.972 --> 19:53.148
I'’ll eat them and you're
going to be disgusted.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.672
I'’m going to come in and you're
going to be there like...

19:55.672 --> 19:56.804
like on your----ing

19:56.804 --> 19:58.240
hands and knees
with the food

19:58.240 --> 20:00.242
all over your mouth and
sh--ting at the same time.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.202
You know when you'’re a kid
and you bob around for apples?

20:03.202 --> 20:04.507
- Right?
- Little bit like that.

20:04.507 --> 20:05.813
- But with curry.
- Right.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.642
Yeah. I'’m a very
classy woman, actually.

20:10.644 --> 20:13.560
<i>Fraser, Ross, Camille.
Please come to the bridge.</i>

20:13.560 --> 20:15.214
- Absolutely.
- On my way.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.260
Oh, oh, oh.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.741
Obviously, with everything
that'’s been happening,

20:20.741 --> 20:22.482
I have spent time with Camille,

20:22.482 --> 20:25.615
and I'’m going to make a decision
because I think the problem

20:25.615 --> 20:27.748
is, is being pulled in
two different directions.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.838
You are going to be
for interior full time.

20:30.838 --> 20:31.926
Got it.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.015
I'’m going to help
you with deck.

20:34.015 --> 20:34.798
She needs a schedule.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.060
- Copy that.
- Okay.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.236
That'’s going to
solve our problem.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.628
I like it.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.064
I'’ve got plenty
of people on deck.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.849
- We'’re good.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

20:41.849 --> 20:43.546
- Thank you.
- All right. Thank you.

20:43.546 --> 20:46.549
But Camille actually
inhibits efficiency.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.551
She was a pain in the ass.

20:48.551 --> 20:51.511
So... Yeah, works for me.

20:51.511 --> 20:52.642
Interior was really
in the weeds.

20:52.642 --> 20:53.730
I'’m going to help you.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.384
I know the boat'’s a big boat.

20:55.384 --> 20:57.778
Something had to happen, you
know, because it wasn'’t working

20:57.778 --> 20:58.909
- how it was going.
- Hey.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.520
Darling, what'’s going on?

21:00.520 --> 21:02.304
- What do you mean?
- Well, you just clearly not

21:02.304 --> 21:03.392
communicating with me.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.046
Well, you'’re never around me.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.787
I'’m always in laundry or
Alissa'’s telling me what to do.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.267
That'’s not an excuse.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.312
If you want to communicate,
you communicate.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.271
You get Alissa to task me
and then Alissa tasks me

21:12.271 --> 21:13.924
with all the sh--
she doesn'’t want to do.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.361
What'’s the problem with that?

21:15.361 --> 21:16.753
Well, it doesn'’t seem fair.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.581
I think you'’re being
very immature.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.104
I'’m getting pulled in
every direction.

21:20.104 --> 21:22.106
Yes, it'’s called working
on a superyacht.

21:22.106 --> 21:24.108
You'’re unhappy and
I can try and change something

21:24.108 --> 21:26.589
before I have to be
sat down with my captain.

21:26.589 --> 21:29.200
But you can'’t tell me that
I can'’t go to my captain.

21:29.200 --> 21:30.593
- I don'’t want to hear that.
- I'’m not telling you...

21:30.593 --> 21:32.639
Are you----ing mental?

21:37.165 --> 21:39.907
If you'’ve had these issues,
they need to come to me and say

21:39.907 --> 21:41.865
"This is not working
for me, Fras."

21:41.865 --> 21:44.259
You can'’t tell me that
I can'’t go to my captain.

21:44.259 --> 21:45.478
I don'’t want to hear that.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.175
Are you----ing mental?

21:47.175 --> 21:49.220
I literally care
about the well-being

21:49.220 --> 21:50.874
personally and professionally
of my crew.

21:50.874 --> 21:54.138
She knows she'’s not working
and the problem is

21:54.138 --> 21:55.575
she'’s not looking
for structure,

21:55.575 --> 21:58.491
she'’s looking for
an excuse to use

21:58.491 --> 22:01.494
to cover the fact
that she'’s sh-- at her job.

22:01.494 --> 22:03.017
It'’s just a lot of eye-rolls.

22:03.017 --> 22:05.149
But I don'’t feel that way
about myself at all.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.761
So I'’ll let
you have your opinion of me,

22:07.761 --> 22:10.154
but I'’m not
going to see it that way ever.

22:10.154 --> 22:12.722
Well, good.
I'’m glad we spoke.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.942
I will arrange a schedule.

22:14.942 --> 22:16.857
For the moment, I just
need you this evening,

22:16.857 --> 22:18.685
I need you to stick
to what we'’ve got.

22:18.685 --> 22:19.903
Got it. No problem.

22:19.903 --> 22:21.775
And we'’ll go from
there tomorrow.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.127
Welcome to hell.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.958
Come on, we need your
opinion on the scarves.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.917
You'’re asking the wrong person.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.354
Captain, the guests
are beginning

22:35.354 --> 22:38.008
to seat, so within the next
10 minutes or so,

22:38.008 --> 22:40.489
<i>I'’d recommend
seating yourself.</i>

22:40.489 --> 22:41.751
Aye, aye.

22:41.751 --> 22:43.405
All right, then.
Am I going to go down?

22:43.405 --> 22:44.928
Yeah.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.756
Interior. Interior.
Galley. Plates are ready to go.

22:46.756 --> 22:48.323
Copy that.

22:48.323 --> 22:50.543
Again, I don'’t understand.
Cocoa espresso soap?

22:50.543 --> 22:54.460
Why would you want to wash your
hands with----ing coffee?

22:54.460 --> 22:55.939
- Wow.
- Pani puri.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.332
And then there'’s a masala.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.943
There'’s a coriander
mint chutney right here.

22:59.943 --> 23:02.119
And then the onion
baati coming up and then

23:02.119 --> 23:04.600
curries will come up, too.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.341
- Ready to go?
- Yeah.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.345
Oh, poppadom.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.303
A mango chutney.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.304
It'’s pretty good, right?

23:13.304 --> 23:14.784
Wow.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.264
- Okay, what is this then?
- It'’s called raita.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.483
It'’s another dish.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.006
Oh, this is so refreshing.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.051
- I really like this.
- Are they happy?

23:21.051 --> 23:22.923
- They'’re loving it.
- Okay. Thank you.

23:22.923 --> 23:26.448
Working with Captain Lee
I understand his expectations.

23:26.448 --> 23:29.495
With new captain,
observing what I can do,

23:29.495 --> 23:31.410
there is some pressure there.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.891
Must make it perfect.
Mommy, won'’t you accept me now?

23:34.891 --> 23:38.373
That'’s so good.

23:38.373 --> 23:40.244
- Thank you, babe.
- You'’re in a bra, aren't you?

23:40.244 --> 23:42.595
No, never wear a bra.

23:42.595 --> 23:46.468
Are you completely nude?
Are your tits out?

23:46.468 --> 23:50.167
Shut up. I'’ve got a
- ing sports bra on.

23:50.167 --> 23:52.169
All right, I need water,
really, anyway.

23:52.169 --> 23:55.477
Oh, that'’s so sad.
All right.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.696
This door, here.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.220
Oh, no, they'’re on to us.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.877
The second you walk in.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.882
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

24:10.536 --> 24:11.667
Okay.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.886
- Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.979
It'’s fun, isn't it?

24:18.979 --> 24:21.285
She has her pickleball
trophies, like,

24:21.285 --> 24:24.027
right next to
her grand slam trophies.

24:26.552 --> 24:28.858
You really have two
gold medals with you?

24:28.858 --> 24:31.339
- Wow, my God!
- Everything looks super good.

24:31.339 --> 24:34.211
Kind of want things
perfect because of Sandy.

24:34.211 --> 24:38.259
So this is
a purple cauliflower and then

24:38.259 --> 24:40.391
- the other one is chickpeas.
- That looks like chickpeas.

24:40.391 --> 24:41.480
Yeah.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.612
- No worries.
- Delicious.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.484
- When do you finish?
- Two A.M.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.232
Yeah.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.844
Why is there
someone always on watch?

24:57.844 --> 24:59.280
So you know the
movie "Titanic?"

24:59.280 --> 25:00.586
Yeah.

25:00.586 --> 25:03.153
Do you remember where
he signed off on watch?

25:03.153 --> 25:04.459
- Yes.
- And he left?

25:04.459 --> 25:05.678
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:05.678 --> 25:08.071
Since that day,
they changed the law.

25:08.071 --> 25:11.945
So when you'’re out, you
have to have 24 hour watch.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.165
No way.
That was so quick.

25:15.165 --> 25:17.428
Yeah, it'’s right around
the corner, the stew pantry.

25:17.428 --> 25:19.822
That'’s even...
That'’s even better coffee.

25:23.609 --> 25:26.046
She'’d be pissed.
She'’s mad at me right now.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.710
The final course this evening

25:37.710 --> 25:40.582
is a Goan fish curry,
it'’s done with coconut milk.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.758
Sautéed celery, not spicy.

25:42.758 --> 25:43.933
- It'’s so tasty.
- Beautiful.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.152
I love Goan Curry.

25:45.152 --> 25:49.722
I just had a religious awakening.

25:49.722 --> 25:52.376
- Thank you.
- Beyond in awe.

25:52.376 --> 25:55.118
I mean I feel so blessed
to have a chef like you.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.294
I'’m absolutely...
thank you.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.035
I don'’t do compliments
very well.

25:59.035 --> 26:00.384
I'’m uncomfortable with others.

26:00.384 --> 26:02.343
I have intimacy issues
and quite frankly,

26:02.343 --> 26:03.953
I have no idea where I'’m going
with the rest of my life.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.825
And I hate myself and I'’m trying
to prove myself to my mother

26:05.825 --> 26:08.479
just for her to say good job. Next.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.395
It'’s been a great experience.

26:11.395 --> 26:12.962
I'’m very excited
to have you on board.

26:12.962 --> 26:14.573
- So...
- Ditto.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.836
So I haven'’t done the schedule,
but let'’s flip back

26:16.836 --> 26:18.794
- to our previous thing.
- Yeah.

26:18.794 --> 26:21.623
So you'’ll go to bed first
and you'’ll be the first one up

26:21.623 --> 26:23.233
and you do the early sets up.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.801
I mean, I'’m actually going
to be the first person

26:25.801 --> 26:27.847
to see the sunrise.

26:27.847 --> 26:30.197
You see, and this
makes a happy Tony.

26:30.197 --> 26:32.503
The new schedule is
is not working out.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.375
I'’ve made the decision
to move it back

26:34.375 --> 26:35.985
to the previous
original schedule.

26:35.985 --> 26:39.075
Tony was on earlies
and Ben was on lates.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.294
Everyone was happy with that.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.122
And happy work is good work.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.906
Then when you see them come up

26:43.906 --> 26:45.865
you can set them
for snorkels and fins.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.345
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Perfect.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.260
Well, this has been a pleasure.
Thank you.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.480
- Cheers to you.
- Cheers.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.613
Thank you.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.571
God. Look at this.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.882
I wish we could
have sex in here.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.067
Babe, like...

27:16.504 --> 27:17.418
I love the hat.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.597
Absolutely.

27:24.077 --> 27:25.208
See you, girl.

27:33.956 --> 27:37.090
I didn'’t realize you hadn't
done the salon at all.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.222
I was making Ben coffee
and getting him...

27:39.222 --> 27:40.920
He'’s up to 2 tonight.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.315
Tell Ben make his own coffee
'’til your off.

27:45.315 --> 27:46.882
Tell him you'’re not
mommy till you'’re off.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.362
I'’m gonna do what I please.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.843
Yeah, but when it keeps
you up, I mean...

27:50.843 --> 27:52.061
You can just go to bed.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.759
I'’m going to get this all done.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.238
But you'’re like,
you know,

27:55.238 --> 27:59.460
like it'’s the pace
that we mentioned before.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.462
Yeah, I know.
That'’s how we feel, too.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.726
Dear God, y'’all are going to
make me----ing quit this boat.

28:04.726 --> 28:05.901
This sh--

28:05.901 --> 28:08.077
We wouldn'’t mind.

28:08.077 --> 28:09.905
You'’re not my babysitter.

28:09.905 --> 28:12.081
- Babe...
- Please stop.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.257
Please. I'’m asking you just...

28:14.257 --> 28:16.259
Babe, why are you so upset?

28:16.259 --> 28:18.435
I'’m marking you down as out.

28:18.435 --> 28:21.700
If you want to be the crazy lady
and keep working, go ahead.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.180
Every night
there'’s a different issue.

28:25.225 --> 28:27.009
Jesus----ing Christ, dude.

28:29.272 --> 28:31.361
Stay up if you want
to stay up, babe,

28:31.361 --> 28:33.276
But I'’m going to
mark you as out.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.104
- You'’re not my babysitter.
- Babe...

28:35.104 --> 28:36.453
Please stop.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.455
I'’m marking you down as out.

28:38.455 --> 28:41.850
If you want to be crazy lady,
and keep working, you go ahead.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.592
Every night
there'’s a different issue.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.161
I'’m going to go to sleep.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.336
- Good night.
- Bye, guys.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.512
See you in the morning.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.775
- I'’m going to bed.
- Me, too. Come this way.

28:53.775 --> 28:54.820
Goodnight, you girls.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.432
It'’s so graceful.

29:28.288 --> 29:30.290
Good morning.
How are you?

29:30.290 --> 29:31.987
I don'’t know how
you feel about this,

29:31.987 --> 29:34.163
but I had a previous schedule
that was working quite well.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.557
- Okay.
- Tony loves earlies

29:36.557 --> 29:38.472
and he gets a little upset
if he'’s on late.

29:38.472 --> 29:39.821
He has to have some sleep.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.083
I'’ll just redo it
and I'’ll make sure

29:41.083 --> 29:42.519
that they get the right hours.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.174
I hate everyone right now.

29:45.174 --> 29:46.523
Oh, me, too, darling.

29:46.523 --> 29:49.396
I just didn'’t
want to miss this view.

29:49.396 --> 29:50.832
I know, right?

29:50.832 --> 29:53.487
So by the way,
my dress tonight is so pretty.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.837
- What color is it?
- Like Dorothy, emerald green.

29:55.837 --> 29:57.534
- Shut up.
- Like...

29:57.534 --> 30:00.929
Okay, well, I'’m thinking then
of wearing some green trousers.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.191
Ooh, I love it.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.584
Up top.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.020
Should we do the standard
or was there

30:05.020 --> 30:06.543
a particular setup you'’d like?

30:06.543 --> 30:08.719
Let'’s go ahead and do crab
cake Benedict today

30:08.719 --> 30:10.547
- because that was requested.
- Ooh, I love that.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.635
- Crab cakes.
- Yeah.

30:11.635 --> 30:12.898
It'’s going to be a good day.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.378
Deck crew, deck crew.
Let'’s get going.

30:15.378 --> 30:18.686
<i>We got a 9 am departure. We got
six minutes, so haul anchor.</i>

30:21.602 --> 30:24.735
Can I interest anyone
in the crab cake benedict?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.302
I'’ll have the crabs
egg benedict.

30:26.302 --> 30:27.738
Okay.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.392
And then we'’re going
split a crepe, too.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.786
- Okay, so four crepes.
- I love the way you think.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.702
Got an order for you.
Let me just write it.

30:34.702 --> 30:35.877
Yeah. Thank you.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.444
This is right.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.925
Boat rides smooth.
It'’s a smooth boat.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.058
I'’ll come with you
with the last two.

30:43.058 --> 30:44.016
Perfect.

30:47.019 --> 30:50.457
For their crab cakes that are
made with local seasoning.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.765
All crew, eta 8 minutes.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.463
Is it anything else I
Can assist you with?

30:56.463 --> 30:58.291
It'’s delicious, thank you.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.472
About 50 feet to
the dock and closing.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.084
Hop on it, sister.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.303
Get your boot on there.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.916
Excellent job, everybody. Excellent.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.091
<i>Excellent job.</i>

31:16.091 --> 31:17.484
Thanks, Cap.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.228
Thank you so much.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.578
Of course.
Have a safe journey home.

31:24.578 --> 31:25.840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.059
Amazing.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.627
Thank you so much.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.368
We just want to thank you guys.

31:32.368 --> 31:35.806
This has been far
beyond what we expected.

31:35.806 --> 31:37.678
Here'’s something from us
for making

31:37.678 --> 31:39.506
this birthday weekend
so special.

31:39.506 --> 31:40.637
- Thank you.
- It was awesome.

31:40.637 --> 31:41.900
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.945
- Thank you.
- It'’s so heavy.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.120
Thank you.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.209
I'’m more like goodbye,
hello, alcohol.

31:47.209 --> 31:48.645
All right, everybody,
nice work.

31:48.645 --> 31:49.908
Out of your whites.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.126
And let'’s turn
this boat around.

31:51.126 --> 31:52.171
Yeah.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.172
Feel how her thick it is.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.390
Oh, yeah.

31:59.395 --> 32:00.657
All that moaning
is making me horny.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.137
Can you guys [bleep] off?

32:04.096 --> 32:07.403
All crew, all crew,
let'’s meet in the sky lounge

32:07.403 --> 32:09.057
<i>- for a tip meeting.
- Copy for galley.</i>

32:12.887 --> 32:14.845
- Thank you Fraser.
- A pleasure.

32:14.845 --> 32:18.675
First and foremost, you guys
are excellent at your craft.

32:18.675 --> 32:21.417
Like me, they thought you
were even more awesome

32:21.417 --> 32:25.160
because the amount
of money they left...

32:25.160 --> 32:28.947
31,000.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.995
$31,000 is a sh--load of money.

32:33.995 --> 32:37.520
And that'’s more that many people
do in the entire year.

32:37.520 --> 32:41.046
-$2384 per person.
- Awesome.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.614
We all work our asses off
in that flipping boat.

32:47.269 --> 32:48.923
You guys did an awesome job.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.533
I would say just
get the essentials done.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.013
That'’s what I
certainly will be doing.

32:52.013 --> 32:53.928
Go get '’em, killers.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.060
Deck.

32:56.844 --> 32:59.412
Let'’s just do bridge deck aft
and just be done with it.

32:59.412 --> 33:01.501
- Nice, mate.
- Time to drink.

33:10.249 --> 33:11.424
Lovely, lovely.

33:24.306 --> 33:25.394
Oh, dear.

33:25.394 --> 33:27.396
Okay, emerald.
Okay, emerald.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.050
Oh, wow.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.921
I love it when we match.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.445
Let'’s go.

33:37.058 --> 33:39.539
I'’m getting drunk tonight.
Please babysit me.

33:39.539 --> 33:40.931
- Cause I'’m a mess.
- Yes, ma'’am.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.674
That'’s a bit eerie.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.332
Snap.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.595
I love Captain Lee.

33:52.595 --> 33:54.467
He'’s like a mentor,
like a dad to me.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.773
- Of course.
- I really love him.

33:56.773 --> 34:00.342
But like, it is so awesome
to work with Sandy

34:00.342 --> 34:03.084
because it'’s like,
it'’s good to have an example

34:03.084 --> 34:05.782
being a female,
like in the industry,

34:05.782 --> 34:08.089
I do like how Sandy
comes in and helps.

34:08.089 --> 34:11.701
Having a girl captain is super
empowering in the boys world.

34:11.701 --> 34:12.876
We can start
freeing up the lines.

34:12.876 --> 34:13.964
Copy.
Thank you.

34:13.964 --> 34:15.705
- Katie. Go ahead.
- Yep.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.186
So many captains just
want to sit on the bridge

34:18.186 --> 34:19.274
and just want to bark orders.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.275
And she'’s not.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.363
<i>Nice work, everyone.</i>

34:21.363 --> 34:22.973
<i>Thanks, Cap.</i>

34:22.973 --> 34:24.714
She'’s trying to teach you
how to be a better person

34:24.714 --> 34:26.890
and a better person
in the yachting world.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.937
I think she'’s an inspiration,
so I look up to her so much.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.852
I think that'’s how she kind
of figured out

34:31.852 --> 34:33.897
- the boat, too.
- For sure.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.553
Hey. Hey, guys.
Here we are.

34:37.553 --> 34:38.902
Welcome.

34:38.902 --> 34:40.426
Girls, can I get a hi-ya?

34:40.426 --> 34:42.036
Hi-ya.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.603
- Good evening, guys.
- Good evening, sir.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.387
Get ready for
some wonderful food.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.780
I'’m actually really excited

34:46.780 --> 34:48.303
to get drunk,
so be completely fair.

34:48.303 --> 34:50.305
I think it'’s just
necessities, to be honest.

34:50.305 --> 34:52.873
Hi, guys. I have a beautiful
favorite rum,

34:52.873 --> 34:54.701
St. Lucia, Admiral Rodney.

34:54.701 --> 34:58.270
To an amazing charter.
Well done.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.532
Yeah.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.162
It'’s actually so natural.

35:21.162 --> 35:22.903
Just what'’s happening
between us.

35:22.903 --> 35:24.383
I'’ve not felt something
like this in a long time.

35:24.383 --> 35:27.081
I'’m in a pretty
happy place, I'’ll tell you that.

35:27.081 --> 35:29.736
Is it for real?

35:29.736 --> 35:31.999
Can I do the teriyaki beef?

35:31.999 --> 35:34.175
I get the fresh fish
in the white wine sauce.

35:34.175 --> 35:36.308
Can I have veggie
pizza, please?

35:36.308 --> 35:38.527
When I finally get to the
end of what I can

35:38.527 --> 35:40.050
physically do
I start on the booze

35:40.050 --> 35:42.052
and then move to
the other things.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.185
It'’s just intoxication,
isn'’t it?

35:44.185 --> 35:45.882
Take the edge off.

35:45.882 --> 35:48.102
So there'’s an English stereotype
that we drink a lot of tea,

35:48.102 --> 35:52.498
but we also do enjoy drinking a
considerable amount of alcohol.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.108
Guess what guys?

35:54.108 --> 35:55.544
We'’ve found free cocktails.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.067
Oh.
Can you do that for me?

35:57.067 --> 35:59.374
Yachting'’s a high pressure environment.

35:59.374 --> 36:00.723
When you get down time,

36:00.723 --> 36:02.769
that usually means
getting pretty loose.

36:02.769 --> 36:04.249
It'’s meant to be work
hard, play hard.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.860
But some of these kids
don'’t know how to play hard.

36:06.860 --> 36:08.949
No, it'’s fine, I'm good
with 60/40.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.386
Coming up...

36:11.386 --> 36:14.041
I don'’t understand.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.696
She acts like she even knows
that'’s going on.

36:16.696 --> 36:19.525
Am I going----ing crazy?

36:19.525 --> 36:21.091
Am I losing my mind?

36:21.091 --> 36:23.398
Get out, Alissa.
I'’m dead-ass serious.

36:23.398 --> 36:24.965
Get out!

36:29.448 --> 36:33.147
Guess what, guys?
We found free cocktails.

36:33.147 --> 36:35.671
- Yum, yum, yum.
- Thank you.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.195
Ooh, that looks
really yummy.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.023
What are you saying?

36:40.023 --> 36:41.199
The calamari'’s good.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.679
I thought you said
like a new word,

36:43.679 --> 36:44.941
like "cubro-" something.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.639
I see you had
already too much rum.

36:46.639 --> 36:49.555
- Do you think?
- Yeah.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.209
Thank you.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.264
Baby Camille gets a little
bit confused sometimes

37:03.264 --> 37:07.529
about the difference of being
a guest and being a crew member.

37:07.529 --> 37:10.315
Little does she know
we'’re on a floating prison.

37:10.315 --> 37:14.014
Just suck it up, get a scrub in
that toilet and get on with it.

37:22.152 --> 37:25.112
Thank you very much,
we appreciate it. Thank you.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.984
There will be a lot of
hard nipples in this car.

37:29.203 --> 37:32.815
- Can you turn off the AC?
- You see, man?

37:32.815 --> 37:33.816
I told you what
was going to happen.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.427
Oh, yeah, yeah.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.093
Jacuzzi.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.486
Are you getting in your swimsuit
Fraser? Don'’t lie to me.

37:51.486 --> 37:52.618
Probably not, I'’m fat.

37:52.618 --> 37:54.620
Fat little bitch.

37:54.620 --> 37:57.710
I'’ve done my work,
so give me a----ing drink.

37:59.146 --> 38:00.800
I don'’t know.
But whatever reason,

38:00.800 --> 38:01.888
I don'’t want to see it.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.846
ing hell, Ross.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.155
Oh, God.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.639
There you go.

38:13.639 --> 38:14.640
Oh, God.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.570
Ross, why are you
bubbling over to me?

38:34.573 --> 38:36.488
Inappropriate,

38:36.488 --> 38:37.445
Ross?

38:38.751 --> 38:39.882
Oh!

38:45.975 --> 38:47.150
No, I'’m very well.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.375
Yeah.

39:00.120 --> 39:01.251
Are you happy?

39:02.731 --> 39:05.473
I feel like this is a sequence
with Ross that, like,

39:05.473 --> 39:06.996
he goes out, gets drunk,

39:06.996 --> 39:08.911
then it'’s like you're
acting ridiculous, you'’re

39:08.911 --> 39:10.435
touching everybody.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.267
I'’m just----ing over it
and so----ing annoyed.

39:44.338 --> 39:46.384
- Okay, bye.
- See you soon.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.301
You have fun last night?

39:51.301 --> 39:54.566
- I'’m so hungover.
- How did you sleep, roomie?

39:54.566 --> 39:57.395
I feel so rude.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.571
I'’ll be back,
you can talk about it.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.269
Ooh ah, yes, yes, yes.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.271
The whole----ing night.

40:04.271 --> 40:07.100
Essentially what you want is
front pocket at the front, okay?

40:07.100 --> 40:09.276
It doesn'’t need to be
too special.

40:09.276 --> 40:10.930
Even looks----ing difficult.

40:10.930 --> 40:12.105
Oh, I don'’t know.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.498
I can'’t remember last night.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.848
You'’re kind of
being a little aggressive.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.458
I was overdue on sleep.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.895
What I should have done
is just gone straight to bed.

40:19.895 --> 40:21.070
Yeah.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.465
You had a lot of
a lot of booze.

40:24.465 --> 40:26.336
- Thank you.
- Thanks, dude.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.555
Katie, have you got a second?

40:27.555 --> 40:29.688
- Yeah.
- I want to talk to you both.

40:29.688 --> 40:31.429
Talk to me.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.301
Apparently, I because this is
the thing I don'’t even know,

40:34.301 --> 40:35.781
but it'’s not an excuse.

40:35.781 --> 40:39.088
I was not in the best
of states last night.

40:39.088 --> 40:41.221
No, you were just like
handsy in a forceful way.

40:41.221 --> 40:42.483
It'’s wrong.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.877
If anybody was upset
or offended by it.

40:44.877 --> 40:46.052
In the moment, yes.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.096
- We were.
- Okay.

40:47.096 --> 40:48.446
And I apologize for that.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.274
Everyone has their days
when they get too drunk.

40:51.274 --> 40:54.277
So I had to choose to just
keep moving forward

40:54.277 --> 40:56.497
and forgive and move on.

40:56.497 --> 40:58.107
Give me a hug, you'’re all good.

40:58.107 --> 40:59.631
You'’re all right.
You'’re all right.

40:59.631 --> 41:00.893
Hayley, how you doing?

41:00.893 --> 41:02.634
- Fine.
- Where'’s your head at?

41:02.634 --> 41:04.636
Uh, slightly up my vagina.

41:04.636 --> 41:05.985
Right.

41:05.985 --> 41:07.465
<i>Camille, Alissa.</i>

41:07.465 --> 41:09.597
<i>Where did you want
those chill veuves?</i>

41:09.597 --> 41:14.123
I don'’t
have time for that sh--.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.429
<i>Camille, Alissa.</i>

41:21.087 --> 41:24.177
Camille, Camille, can you come
please see me on the bridge?

41:24.177 --> 41:25.700
- What?
- What?

41:25.700 --> 41:26.919
Have I got two...
I'’ve got two radios on, babe.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.224
It is on, by the way.

41:28.224 --> 41:29.791
- Didn'’t I just give you one?
- Yeah.

41:29.791 --> 41:33.665
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:33.665 --> 41:35.493
I'’ve had a lot
of conversations with you.

41:35.493 --> 41:36.755
Sure.

41:36.755 --> 41:39.409
And I heard the call
for you to help Alissa.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.020
I heard it.
I was on the radio.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.848
I don'’t want to
hear the pushback.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.371
- Okay.
- You understand?

41:44.371 --> 41:46.416
I hear the radio chatter.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.114
Here'’s what I want
to say to you.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.856
You have this charter
to prove to me

41:50.856 --> 41:52.727
that you'’re in it to win it,

41:52.727 --> 41:56.078
because I promise you
you'’ll be off the boat.

41:56.078 --> 41:57.210
Okay, that'’s fair.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.081
No more pushback.
Thank you.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.216
<i>Fraser. Fraser, can you please
come to the bridge?</i>

42:03.216 --> 42:06.219
I can'’t do this anymore.

42:06.219 --> 42:08.482
So I just had a conversation
with Camille.

42:08.482 --> 42:11.137
I want to know the minute
she does pushback.

42:11.137 --> 42:15.228
If she isn'’t 100% in,
she'’s gone the next charter.

42:15.228 --> 42:17.622
Jesus Christ.

42:17.622 --> 42:19.101
I really appreciate
you saying that.

42:19.101 --> 42:20.407
I really do.

42:20.407 --> 42:21.887
I think that definitely
where we'’re at.

42:21.887 --> 42:23.453
I don'’t understand.

42:23.453 --> 42:26.805
How can she act like she
even knows what'’s going on?

42:26.805 --> 42:28.284
And to be quite frank,

42:28.284 --> 42:30.896
I'’m very happy
with my team of three.

42:30.896 --> 42:33.942
Am I going----ing crazy?

42:33.942 --> 42:35.248
Am I losing my mind?

42:35.248 --> 42:37.598
Is this like a joke?

42:37.598 --> 42:39.600
Maybe I just have
an inflated ego

42:39.600 --> 42:42.081
that'’s too big for
this----ing world.

42:42.081 --> 42:44.518
I have one charter to prove it.

42:44.518 --> 42:45.737
What the [bleep] am
I going to prove?

42:45.737 --> 42:46.738
What do I need to prove?

42:46.738 --> 42:48.304
Get out, Alissa.

42:48.304 --> 42:50.263
I'’m dead-ass serious.
I'’m having... Get out.

42:50.263 --> 42:52.134
Seriously, please, please.

42:52.134 --> 42:53.788
I'’m pulling
Captain Sandy'’s sheets.

42:53.788 --> 42:55.573
Please Alissa, please, get out.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.313
Go cry in a different room, I'’m
pulling Captain Sandy'’s sheets.

42:57.313 --> 42:58.619
I'’ve been here, and
you'’re just sitting there.

42:58.619 --> 42:59.489
Please get out.

42:59.489 --> 43:00.665
Baby, I'’m pulling sheets

43:00.665 --> 43:02.492
God damn, Alissa.
