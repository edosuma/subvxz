00:10.227 --> 00:12.490
So, you should ask yourself,

00:12.534 --> 00:14.144
with every decision you make,

00:14.188 --> 00:15.580
is this good for the V.A.?

00:15.624 --> 00:18.975
Am I helping with
the V.A.'s strategic vision?

00:19.019 --> 00:21.934
Now, my guess is you're
all asking the same question.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.633
With our new administration,
will you still have a job?

00:24.676 --> 00:28.724
But I want you to ask
a slightly different question.

00:28.767 --> 00:32.597
Will my job still have me?

00:32.641 --> 00:33.903
Am I the right fit

00:33.946 --> 00:35.905
to continue fulfilling my duties

00:35.948 --> 00:37.298
to the best of my ability

00:37.341 --> 00:40.562
for the greater good
of the company?

00:40.605 --> 00:43.869
We just want to make sure that
we have some new staff in place

00:43.913 --> 00:47.699
to have things run a little bit
more smoothly around here.

00:49.136 --> 00:52.139
politics will not enter
into any of my decisions.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.705
Bullshit.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.055
We've had a late start,

00:55.098 --> 00:57.187
mostly due to the delayed
presidential transition.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.667
I'm sure you've
heard about that.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.278
No hard feelings. Huh?

01:03.541 --> 01:05.282
I'll probably head back to D.C.

01:05.326 --> 01:07.893
Everybody says
the Trump connection hurts us.

01:07.937 --> 01:09.286
How about you?

01:09.330 --> 01:12.159
If they want me,
I'll stay on here.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.164
What?

01:20.515 --> 01:22.212
Kurt?

01:29.219 --> 01:30.742
Leo's Bike Shop.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.396
That was the name
of your business?

01:32.440 --> 01:35.530
Yes. My grandfather came over
from Holland after World War II,

01:35.573 --> 01:36.661
Got a loan, opened it.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.098
My family's run it for 60 years.

01:38.141 --> 01:40.448
-Until last year?
-Yes. We had to close down.

01:40.491 --> 01:42.145
-Why?
-Her.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.364
Your Honor, I must object.

01:43.407 --> 01:46.628
My client is not
the direct causal reason

01:46.671 --> 01:48.151
for this man's business
to close.

01:48.195 --> 01:51.589
Counselor, what is the violation
to the rules of evidence?

01:51.633 --> 01:53.025
Inflammatory?

01:53.069 --> 01:55.027
-Nope. Overruled.
-Exception.

01:55.071 --> 01:57.160
Mr. Rahtenberg...
-Rottenberg, Your Honor.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.597
You don't have to
keep saying "exception."

01:59.641 --> 02:00.990
If you go to a higher court,

02:01.033 --> 02:02.339
they're going to
take it for granted

02:02.383 --> 02:04.124
that you're taking exception
with my rulings.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.169
-Please, continue.
Why are you saying

02:06.213 --> 02:08.476
that the defendant,
Ms. Marina Beck,

02:08.519 --> 02:10.173
was the reason that
your business closed?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.827
She was a neighbor
who got angry when I parked

02:11.870 --> 02:15.047
in front of her house. She
felt the front curb was hers,

02:15.091 --> 02:17.659
so she started harassing
my family and my business.

02:17.702 --> 02:20.444
Objection to harassment.
It calls for a conclusion.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.230
No, sir. No.
The witness is answering.

02:23.273 --> 02:26.320
He's not the questioner.
Improper objection.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.539
-Exception.
-Yes, excepted.

02:28.583 --> 02:32.195
-Please continue.
-Now, how did the defendant
harass you and your business?

02:32.239 --> 02:33.805
Online.
We found out from a friend

02:33.849 --> 02:35.851
there was an article
on her newsfeed

02:35.894 --> 02:37.896
about me molesting a boy
at the local school.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.463
And it was untrue?
-Yes, completely.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.291
But it looked real.
And there were

02:41.335 --> 02:43.337
photos of me.
And you also
discovered that

02:43.380 --> 02:46.427
-she had created a news article?
-Yes.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.820
And how do you know that
Ms. Beck created that article?

02:48.864 --> 02:51.127
We hired an Internet
forensic specialist.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.520
It wasn't just an article.

02:52.563 --> 02:55.914
She created 20 different
social media accounts

02:55.958 --> 02:59.004
of supposed parents who accused
me of touching their children.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.223
And this caused you
to lose business?

03:00.267 --> 03:01.790
Many people
saw our business name

03:01.833 --> 03:03.313
on that website,
Business Scoundrels,

03:03.357 --> 03:05.141
where she accused me
of pedophilia.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.099
If you look for my name online,

03:07.143 --> 03:09.450
articles and discussions
about me molesting children.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.408
And that's why you're suing,
Mr. Van De Berg?

03:11.452 --> 03:13.193
Yes, I want
the harassments to stop.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.020
She's still posting
ugly things about my family.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.326
Even today.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.676
But I'm also suing
for my loss of business.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.287
Nothing further, Your Honor.

03:21.070 --> 03:24.247
Sir, why didn't you apply
to get your name removed

03:24.291 --> 03:26.031
-from those websites?
-I did.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.381
-Not hard enough, apparently.
-Business Scoundrels

03:27.424 --> 03:29.078
would only remove
the accusations

03:29.121 --> 03:30.340
if I paid a $10,000 service fee.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.734
And isn't your good name
worth $10,000?

03:32.777 --> 03:35.432
I didn't want to pay it
because it was extortion.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.434
They accept vile accusations
without proof

03:37.478 --> 03:39.654
and then want to charge me
to take them down?

03:39.697 --> 03:42.004
Okay, okay, I've heard enough.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.224
Let's bring it up here.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.313
Not you, just the lawyers.

03:48.184 --> 03:51.709
Okay, Mr. Rahtenberg,
you're going to lose.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.015
Rottenberg.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.321
You have been biased
against my name

03:54.364 --> 03:56.584
-from the beginning, ma'am.
-No, sir.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.629
You have a rotten case,

03:58.673 --> 04:00.718
and an awful client.

04:00.762 --> 04:04.287
What I would suggest you do
is negotiate a fair settlement.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.680
Because if you come back here

04:05.723 --> 04:08.465
it's gonna cost you
twice as much. That's it.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.643
-Tomorrow at my office?
-Sure.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.603
Let's the paperwork together
for a settlement.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.213
On it.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.434
We need the paperwork
for a settlement.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.957
Keep track
of your billable hours.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.611
On it.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.004
You two go through the billing,

04:26.048 --> 04:27.397
and you two double-check
their work.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.921
Oh, and keep track
of your hours.

04:33.838 --> 04:36.319
Split these up into piles for
every month for every year,

04:36.363 --> 04:38.626
and keep an accounting
of the totals.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.194
Let's get to it.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.199
Things should get better, right?

04:47.243 --> 04:49.637
Something other than paperwork?

04:51.029 --> 04:52.727
Law of averages.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.816
You.
What's your name?

04:54.859 --> 04:56.078
Carmen Moyo.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.862
-Let's go.
Uh, I was told

04:57.906 --> 04:58.907
to collate these bills.

04:59.777 --> 05:02.258
Did the executive partner
tell you to collate those bills?

05:02.302 --> 05:03.781
-No.
Right,

05:03.825 --> 05:05.653
because that's me.
Let's go.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.705
Great.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.273
-Why am I supposed to know you?
-Uh, I don't know if you are.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.231
Why does Benjamin Dafoe
know you?

05:19.275 --> 05:20.624
I don't know who that is.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.410
Oh, my God.
Law school illiteracy.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.283
Is this her?

05:27.327 --> 05:29.241
Carmen Moyo, as requested.

05:29.285 --> 05:32.462
I don't understand.
Who are you?

05:34.290 --> 05:36.074
-Carmen Moyo.
-No. No, no.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.381
-Why are you important?
-I don't think that I am.

05:38.425 --> 05:41.297
Then why do I have
my top client asking for you?

05:41.341 --> 05:43.995
-Who's that?
-Mr. Wolfe-Coleman.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.912
Y-Your client is Wolfe-Coleman.

05:47.956 --> 05:49.392
Hmm. W-What does he need?

05:49.436 --> 05:51.307
Last night, the police
searched his home

05:51.351 --> 05:53.527
for any evidence of rape. They
believe they found something

05:53.570 --> 05:55.572
and Mr. Wolfe-Coleman
wanted me to contact

05:55.616 --> 05:59.228
Carmen Moyo to represent him.
So...

05:59.271 --> 06:00.621
how did that happen?

06:01.883 --> 06:05.147
I-Is your client
an acquaintance of Oscar Rivi?

06:05.974 --> 06:07.410
The drug dealer? No.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.370
Is your client...

06:10.413 --> 06:12.197
is your client currently
at Menard Correctional?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.635
He was, yes. Why?

06:14.678 --> 06:16.376
I'm representing Mr. Rivi.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.555
Carmen's one of our best.

06:21.598 --> 06:26.037
Uh, why don't we get the
retainer agreement going, Ben?

06:47.668 --> 06:49.191
Oh, good. Go home.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.019
I'll have the rest of the bills
ready to sort tomorrow.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.281
The rest?

06:52.324 --> 06:54.196
Yeah. This is half.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.892
I couldn't have
stolen anything.

07:37.935 --> 07:41.243
I wrote my book before <i>Emily
in Pariswas even on the air.</i>

07:41.286 --> 07:43.941
That doesn't mean you
couldn't have gotten a copy.
-Hey! Welcome to Night Court.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.552
-Missed you.
Emails get hacked
every day.

07:45.595 --> 07:47.336
Oh, come on. I never read

07:47.379 --> 07:49.469
her stupid book, and her
book is just a rip-off anyway.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.601
There are lines that
are identical, Your Honor.

07:51.645 --> 07:54.038
Because they're lines
from <i>Emily in Paris.</i>

07:54.082 --> 07:55.475
What is this one about?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.564
That guy says
she plagiarized his book.

07:57.607 --> 08:00.523
-Copyright laws, interesting.
-Here, here, here, here.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.830
-Here's the program.
You've got to be
kidding me.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.527
No. I said that, out loud.
You plagiarized
from <i>Emily in Paris.</i>

08:04.571 --> 08:06.181
I've never even read the book.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.617
These are actual books?

08:07.661 --> 08:09.750
Self-published.
Fan fiction.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.882
Oh, come on. I know you've got
a reputation for doing this,

08:11.926 --> 08:13.884
-and I'm not gonna let you...
-No, 'cause what I said...

08:13.928 --> 08:16.452
Okay. All right, Stop, stop,
stop. That's it. I get it.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.715
Your Honor, this is not
a small matter.

08:18.759 --> 08:21.065
Look at <i>Fifty Shades of Gray.
That started as fan fiction.</i>

08:21.109 --> 08:22.763
Okay.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.068
I'm taking a recess.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.548
Um, don't fight when I'm gone.

08:25.592 --> 08:26.854
You.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.377
Can you join me in chambers?

08:28.420 --> 08:29.900
You know him?

08:29.944 --> 08:31.467
No.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.646
Thoughts?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.258
Well, it's copyright law.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.825
Nobody can copy
unless they have the right.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.305
Mm.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.263
But they both borrowed
from <i>Emily in Paris.</i>

08:45.307 --> 08:47.178
Right, I mean...

08:47.222 --> 08:48.919
Look, there's
no real money here.

08:48.963 --> 08:51.574
All they want is attention
and to feel like they've won.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.097
Hmm.

08:53.141 --> 08:55.099
-End of <i>Wizard of Oz.
-What?</i>

08:55.143 --> 08:56.927
Scarecrow getting a diploma.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.451
Uh... right.
Can you make one?

08:59.495 --> 09:01.802
I'm in Copy Coop.
I can make anything.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.327
Okay.

09:06.981 --> 09:09.505
-Bing. Here's my decision.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.594
Your books have both
been copyrighted

09:11.638 --> 09:13.814
by me and this court,
but under different names.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.772
Neither of you get Paris.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.818
That is your punishment
for not being original.

09:18.819 --> 09:20.603
You get <i>Judy in Nice</i>

09:20.647 --> 09:22.431
and you get <i>Janice in Lyon.</i>

09:22.474 --> 09:23.954
I don't like Lyon.

09:23.998 --> 09:25.347
Tough.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.262
It's either Lyon
or South Bronx. You decide.

09:28.045 --> 09:29.656
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:29.699 --> 09:30.657
Good.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.223
Now, look at each other and say

09:32.267 --> 09:33.660
"I respect and I love you."

09:34.530 --> 09:37.446
Say it or I take away
your copyrights.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.494
-I respect and I love you.
-I respect and I love you.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.584
Do it till I believe you.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.324
Marissa.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.718
-Nicely done.
-Thank you.

09:48.762 --> 09:51.678
Amazing what you can do
without a ton of red tape.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.593
Be my law clerk.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.551
What? No.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.162
-I have a job.
-Work here.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.817
Part-time, full-time, your call.

10:00.861 --> 10:01.949
Flat fee.

10:01.992 --> 10:03.951
Ten percent
of all the legal filings.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.736
Unlimited use
of the copy machines.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.957
Your Honor, this is not a court.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.829
I-I don't know what it is,
but it's...

10:12.873 --> 10:14.526
The future.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.921
Come on.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.488
Be here.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.404
I-I can't.

10:22.447 --> 10:23.405
I have a job.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.973
I want to pass the bar.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.583
I want to be a real lawyer.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.978
You know why
all these people are here?

10:31.021 --> 10:34.895
'Cause the courts
and the lawyers and the appeals

10:34.938 --> 10:38.072
have made justice...

10:38.115 --> 10:40.248
unattainable.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.076
Out of reach.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.861
To anyone who doesn't
have a shitload of money

10:44.905 --> 10:46.689
to wait it out.

10:46.733 --> 10:50.475
That's why Exxon
beats out Mr. Nobody.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.610
Read Kafka's <i>Before the Law.</i>

10:54.654 --> 10:56.351
Now I've got homework.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.527
It's one page long.

10:58.570 --> 11:00.660
Don't be a philistine.

11:02.531 --> 11:05.839
Justice is only just
if it's available to everyone.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.629
<i>Kurt? I delayed the reservation,</i>

11:13.673 --> 11:16.023
so I think we can still make it.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.330
Babe?

11:19.374 --> 11:21.115
I'm pouring a drink.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.246
Do you want one?

11:46.444 --> 11:48.664
Who is this?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.580
No one.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.104
Well, you just drew in a...

11:54.148 --> 11:55.627
a beard and a mustache on him.

11:55.671 --> 11:56.759
I was doodling.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.761
You-you don't doodle.
In fact,

11:58.805 --> 12:01.459
you're the exact opposite
of a doodler. Who is it?

12:02.852 --> 12:05.681
I don't know. I thought it was
somebody I knew, but...

12:05.725 --> 12:07.944
-I'm not sure.
-But you suspect.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.642
I mean, if it's
one of the insurrectionists,

12:10.686 --> 12:13.297
then you need to tell the feds.

12:13.341 --> 12:14.516
Yeah, I'm not sure it's him.

12:14.559 --> 12:15.865
Well, who do you think it is?

12:15.909 --> 12:17.649
Just somebody
I went shooting with.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.086
Oh, my God, then it's him.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.479
No, he didn't talk that way.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.525
He wasn't political.
He's a veteran.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.310
-Kurt! That's the profile.
-Yeah,

12:26.354 --> 12:28.660
and I don't drop a dime
because he fits a profile.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.967
What is this, a schoolyard?
Drop a dime?

12:31.011 --> 12:33.665
This man tried to hang
the vice president.

12:33.709 --> 12:35.842
He tried to kill Nancy Pelosi.

12:35.885 --> 12:38.148
You don't know that, and
I'm not gonna be responsible

12:38.192 --> 12:39.454
for naming names.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.412
-This is not McCarthyism.
-Actually, it is.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.284
-They stormed the Capitol!
-The feds

12:43.327 --> 12:45.112
will threaten me with indictment

12:45.155 --> 12:46.548
if I don't name names.

12:46.591 --> 12:47.941
Even if I'm not sure
if they're responsible.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.769
And then they will be asked
to name names,

12:49.812 --> 12:51.596
and everybody will get
lawyers, and...

12:51.640 --> 12:54.512
and those are the only people
who will benefit.

13:06.046 --> 13:07.743
What do you need, Diane?

13:08.570 --> 13:10.528
Uh, I-I don't know.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.226
Uh, maybe nothing.

13:12.269 --> 13:13.705
Do you want me to come back?

13:15.795 --> 13:17.753
No.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.932
I want to know who this man is.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.196
Well, that's
gonna be pretty hard.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.632
It's not a great photo.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.462
Well, I-I may have
some more information.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.073
He's a veteran.

13:33.116 --> 13:37.033
And he shoots
at the same range as, um...

13:37.077 --> 13:38.861
as my husband, Kurt.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.690
It's the Kankakee Gun Club.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.475
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.438
What?! Are you serious?!
Look,

13:50.481 --> 13:52.048
you're missing the tragedy here.

13:52.092 --> 13:53.441
It's not just you guys.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.746
She can't pay me either.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.487
Well, we will be
attaching her wages.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.968
Yeah, you're welcome to it, but
there's nothing there. Nothing.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.752
-I looked.
-Well, even-even
the inheritance?

14:00.796 --> 14:02.754
-Swallowed up by taxes.
This is bullshit.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.582
I understand your anger.

14:04.626 --> 14:08.499
But, hey, congratulations
on your win.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.850
Dylan Pike.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.242
What?

14:12.286 --> 14:13.591
Dylan Pike.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.985
-The man in the wanted photo.
-How...

14:16.029 --> 14:19.815
Wow. The feds couldn't find him
and you-- what, just like that?

14:19.859 --> 14:22.774
-They didn't know he shot
at the Kankakee Gun Club.
-That's all you needed?

14:22.818 --> 14:24.254
The club had his driver's
license on their computers.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.430
-And how did you get it?
-Diane, if I told you that,

14:26.474 --> 14:27.518
you wouldn't need me.

14:27.562 --> 14:28.911
Well, we don't pay you enough.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.958
Oh, I know that.
Want to see his photo?

14:39.879 --> 14:43.447
Um, you want me
to call the feds?

14:43.491 --> 14:45.493
Uh, no. I can.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.800
Or, I... I-I will.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.108
I-I just
have to think about it.

14:53.109 --> 14:54.894
Hello, sir.
Thank you for waiting.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.330
-Welcome to Reddick/
-Lockhart.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.375
Can I help you?

14:58.419 --> 15:00.900
David Rathbone for Liz Reddick.

15:03.032 --> 15:06.818
I think David Cord is in
the reception waiting for you.

15:06.862 --> 15:09.299
David Cord?
Like, the Cord Brothers?

15:09.343 --> 15:11.171
Yeah.
He asked for you,

15:11.214 --> 15:13.390
but he gave his name
as David Rathbone.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.652
Why?

15:14.696 --> 15:16.176
I have no idea.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.830
What have I done with the aces?

15:18.874 --> 15:20.702
-Sure.
-Mm.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.704
Oh...

15:25.620 --> 15:27.622
Thank you. Thank you.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.624
Mr. Cord?

15:29.667 --> 15:31.713
Ms. Reddick. Hello.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.323
I knew your father.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.672
I hated your father.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.153
Yes. Well, he hated you, too.

15:37.197 --> 15:40.069
You gave the name Rathbone?

15:40.113 --> 15:41.723
I did.

15:41.766 --> 15:44.552
I do that, sometimes, just to
see if I get as warm a reception

15:44.595 --> 15:46.815
as I would
if I gave my true name.

15:46.858 --> 15:50.036
And I'm happy to say I did.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.689
-Hello.
-Oh, this is Marissa.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.561
This is one
of our law clinic lawyers.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.215
Eli Gold's daughter.

15:55.258 --> 15:58.348
Democrats as far as
the eye can see.

15:59.175 --> 16:02.613
Why don't you ask Julius
to join us. Hmm?

16:05.573 --> 16:08.054
I want to save the country.

16:10.186 --> 16:11.927
You want to save it?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.146
Yes.

16:13.189 --> 16:14.147
Don't you?

16:14.190 --> 16:15.235
Yes.

16:15.278 --> 16:19.195
January 6
changed everything for me.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.589
My "road to Damascus" moment,
but...

16:21.632 --> 16:24.374
Do I have to explain
that to Democrats?

16:24.418 --> 16:25.549
No.

16:25.593 --> 16:26.855
And I'm not a Democrat.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.378
Ah! That's my point.

16:28.422 --> 16:31.512
See, I came to realize that we--
say, the three of us--

16:31.555 --> 16:34.297
we have a lot more in common
than we might think.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.559
We all love this country.

16:35.603 --> 16:38.040
I love this country.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.650
It gave my family a start.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.044
My dad, he started
a small laundry business.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.394
Sent his son to college,
and I...

16:44.438 --> 16:46.309
made something of myself.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.617
Too many people take America
for granted.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.053
I don't.

16:51.097 --> 16:54.100
And I suspect
that you don't either.

16:54.143 --> 16:57.755
Well, I-I don't think
there's a disagreement there.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.844
I think the disagreement
is in the details.

16:59.888 --> 17:03.065
Ah. Well, let's start
with the details.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.720
Reif Van De Berg
and Leo's Bike Shop.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.245
What is that?
-Uh, that's a...

17:09.289 --> 17:12.466
uh, a defamation suit
involving a small business.

17:12.509 --> 17:13.945
A-A suit that we won.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.208
But it didn't make
any difference

17:15.251 --> 17:16.861
because the defendant
is bankrupt.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.038
Uh, I-I don't, uh, know how...

17:19.081 --> 17:20.387
And the client's retainer
is gone.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.650
-He has no money to pay you.
-Uh, Mr. Cord...

17:22.693 --> 17:26.349
So, I want to hire you to
continue to sue on his behalf.

17:26.393 --> 17:29.961
I'll offer you a $12 million
fund to continue the suit

17:30.005 --> 17:32.138
for another six months.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.270
Uh... Why?

17:34.314 --> 17:37.491
My only request is that you go
after a different defendant

17:37.534 --> 17:38.796
for defamation.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.885
One with deeper pockets.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.365
The social media company

17:42.409 --> 17:45.281
that distributed Ms. Beck's
vile lies to the public.

17:45.325 --> 17:48.371
But $12 million
is a lot of money.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.591
So, what's in this for you?

17:50.634 --> 17:53.159
I want to go after Section 230.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.640
How do I make
an anonymous phone call?

19:23.684 --> 19:26.208
-Do you have a burner?
-No.

19:38.786 --> 19:41.005
Uh, hello. Yes...

19:41.049 --> 19:42.833
I would like to report the name

19:42.877 --> 19:45.662
of one of the January 6 rioters.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.969
I saw on your poster.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.367
Dylan Pike.

19:55.672 --> 19:57.021
No.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.067
I-I'd rather not leave my name.

20:00.764 --> 20:03.071
No. I-I don't.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.877
David Cord
is not a good look for us.

21:53.921 --> 21:57.533
I think we would look
great in $12 million.

21:57.577 --> 21:59.013
Blood money.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.667
That's a little dramatic.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.712
The amount of money he's spent
funding Republican campaigns

22:02.756 --> 22:05.541
-over the last decade...
-If you all weren't all so busy

22:05.585 --> 22:07.717
turning up your noses
at the Republican Party,

22:07.761 --> 22:10.851
you might remember
that Democrats and Republicans

22:10.894 --> 22:12.374
thought Section 230 was flawed.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.028
Here's an opportunity
for the unity

22:14.071 --> 22:16.291
that the Democrats say
they want.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.075
I've never asked to unite
with white supremacists.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.903
Yeah, let's not pretend this is
some bipartisan issue, though.

22:19.947 --> 22:23.167
The right has no interest
in stopping conspiracy theories

22:23.211 --> 22:24.604
on these platforms.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.083
It would help if the boomers
would stop falling

22:26.127 --> 22:27.346
for those conspiracy theories

22:27.389 --> 22:30.218
and sharing it
with their friends.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.396
Sorry, but it would.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.485
And no more plotting
to overthrow the government,

22:36.529 --> 22:38.269
or stalking journalists online.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.446
What about the employee
that wants to speak out

22:40.489 --> 22:42.839
against the boss
that's sexually harassing them?

22:42.883 --> 22:45.320
They repeal Section 230,
and there would be no #MeToo.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.540
I don't believe that.
You regulate Section 230,

22:47.583 --> 22:50.804
and let the newspapers get back
to actually being competitive.

22:50.847 --> 22:52.936
We're not going back
to reading newspapers, grandpa.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.938
-Grandpa?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's inappropriate.

22:54.982 --> 22:56.723
-There's no need...
-Did you really
just say "grandpa"?

22:56.766 --> 22:58.289
Wait! Wait. Wait. Wait.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.466
If we're gonna go after
the social media giants,

23:00.509 --> 23:04.121
we need the resources
of a deep pocket like Cord.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.775
Where are you going?
-To court.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.735
But we haven't decided if we're
taking this Cord money yet.

23:08.778 --> 23:10.171
Of course we are.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.438
Ooh-kay.

23:17.352 --> 23:18.788
This is a new suit?

23:18.832 --> 23:21.791
It's the same facts, Your Honor,
but different defendant.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.576
-You're suing Chumhum?
Yes, Your Honor.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.926
You have read Section 230,
I assume.

23:25.969 --> 23:29.320
Yes, Section 230 purports
to shield Internet platforms

23:29.364 --> 23:33.455
from liability, but we believe
it is unconstitutional

23:33.499 --> 23:36.023
because it contravenes
the First Amendment.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.328
And how does it do that?

23:37.372 --> 23:39.156
Well, the First Amendment
states that, uh,

23:39.200 --> 23:40.462
"Congress shall make no law

23:40.506 --> 23:41.811
abridging the freedom
of the press."

23:41.855 --> 23:44.335
Section 230 doesn't say anything
about the press.

23:44.379 --> 23:48.252
No, but in practice,
the law has decimated the press.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.732
Through Section 230,

23:49.776 --> 23:52.996
the government has placed
its thumb on the scales,

23:53.040 --> 23:54.781
in favor of Internet platforms

23:54.824 --> 23:57.174
over newspapers
and other press outlets.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.094
Huh.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.669
Fucking Democrats.

24:13.713 --> 24:16.237
Take care. Stay in touch.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.503
May I help you?

24:21.547 --> 24:23.374
Oh. Sure hope so.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.028
Um, Madeline Starkey.
I'm with the FBI.

24:25.072 --> 24:28.423
I'll never get used to saying
that. It sounds so melodramatic.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.470
My husband made a ringtone
for my phone.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.385
I'm Madeline Starkey
with the FBI.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.436
Hi.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.960
-May I help you, Ms. Starkey?
-Oh, so polite.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.790
Uh, yes, uh, you may help me
by answering a few questions.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.576
Uh, and I won't take up
too much of your time.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.534
-Seems like a bad day
-Presidential transition,

24:52.578 --> 24:54.405
a lot of people
are being let go.

24:54.449 --> 24:56.320
Uh, I'm so sorry.
But not you, though?

24:56.364 --> 24:59.149
Not yet.
Unless that's why you're here.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.716
Oh. No, no, no, no.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.935
I'm the deep state.

25:01.978 --> 25:05.112
We don't do anything meaningful.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.855
Mm. I spoke to a friend
of yours, Dylan Pike.

25:11.031 --> 25:15.514
He said you trained him in the
use of AR-15s, nine millimeters,

25:15.557 --> 25:17.603
how to buy ammunition in bulk.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.563
We covered a bunch of subjects
in his group.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.652
So it wasn't just a one-on-one.

25:23.696 --> 25:25.219
It was a small group
of veterans.

25:25.262 --> 25:27.395
I believe this group
was five veterans.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.092
You wouldn't happen
to remember the names

25:29.136 --> 25:31.747
of the other four individuals
who trained with Mr. Pike?

25:31.791 --> 25:34.663
This would be sometime prior
to the January events, uh,

25:34.707 --> 25:36.491
at the Capitol.

25:40.843 --> 25:43.150
Could you provide me
with those names?

25:45.239 --> 25:46.632
No.

25:46.675 --> 25:48.068
Sorry. Can't.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.331
You can't? Or you won't?

25:55.075 --> 25:57.773
You have a very calm manner.

25:57.817 --> 26:00.471
I should be calm,
but I'm unnerved.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.473
Anything else, Ms. Starkey?

26:02.517 --> 26:04.388
No. No, no, not right now.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.826
But pretty soon.
We'll be in touch.

26:13.397 --> 26:16.749
You've been a managing editor
for how long, Mr. Hookstratten?

26:16.792 --> 26:17.880
Twenty-three years.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.012
I was a reporter

26:19.055 --> 26:20.317
for ten years before that.

26:20.361 --> 26:21.797
And you were aware,
were you not,

26:21.841 --> 26:24.017
of this story that was
circulating on social media

26:24.060 --> 26:27.237
about a bike shop owner
grooming school children

26:27.281 --> 26:29.239
for sexual exploitation.

26:29.283 --> 26:30.589
I was aware of it, yes.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.634
Why didn't your newspaper
cover the story?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.505
It-- It seems like
it was newsworthy, right?

26:34.549 --> 26:37.639
-If it were true, yes.
-How do you know it wasn't?

26:37.683 --> 26:39.554
Because I spent two weeks
running down the rumors.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.382
In the case of this story,
there was nothing,

26:41.425 --> 26:43.558
just a lot of gossip online.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.865
Now, what kind of financial
shape of your newspaper

26:45.908 --> 26:48.781
at the time that you decided
not to run the story?

26:48.824 --> 26:52.088
Your Honor, I'm sorry,
but I have to object there.

26:52.132 --> 26:53.568
Relevance.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.745
The financial impact
of Section 230's exemption

26:56.789 --> 26:59.618
-on newspapers
is directly relevant.
-Overruled.

26:59.661 --> 27:02.011
We were broke
and getting broker.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.230
The advertisers we'd counted on

27:03.273 --> 27:04.840
had mostly gone over
to the Internet.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.016
It was only a matter of time
before we wouldn't be able

27:07.060 --> 27:08.191
to keep the lights on anymore.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.716
Six months ago, that time came.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.326
Your witness.

27:13.893 --> 27:16.635
Classified ads were a big source
of revenue for newspapers

27:16.678 --> 27:18.637
-at one time. Is that right?
-They were.

27:18.680 --> 27:22.205
I imagine those being a thing
of the past contributed to that.

27:22.249 --> 27:23.685
-It did.
-What about cable news networks?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.556
-That have an impact?
-Objection, Your Honor.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.210
We are not litigating over
cable news or classified ads.

27:27.254 --> 27:30.649
That's right. We're litigating
over your untested theory

27:30.692 --> 27:33.086
that newspapers went bankrupt
because social media

27:33.129 --> 27:35.741
has a government-sanctioned
advantage in the marketplace.

27:35.784 --> 27:39.092
We should, Your Honor, at the
very least, test this theory.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.398
Agreed. Overruled.

27:41.442 --> 27:43.574
Is it possible,
Mr. Hookstratten,

27:43.618 --> 27:46.621
that the reason these newspapers
went bankrupt

27:46.665 --> 27:48.057
is no more complicated

27:48.101 --> 27:50.103
than they didn't keep up
with their competition?

27:50.146 --> 27:53.759
-That's one reason.
-Thank you for not contesting
the obvious.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.285
Mr. Hookstratten...

27:59.765 --> 28:01.897
...didn't your newspaper
conduct this survey

28:01.941 --> 28:04.987
-of where readers
were now getting their news?
-Yes.

28:05.031 --> 28:06.772
And what were
the top four sources?

28:06.815 --> 28:09.513
Facebook, Twitter,
Google, Chumhum.

28:09.557 --> 28:13.430
None of which can be sued
for defamation, libel, or fraud.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.781
Now, do you think
that enters in to what stories

28:15.824 --> 28:19.045
you do run, and what stories
you do not run?

28:19.088 --> 28:21.482
It's always hanging
over your head.

28:21.525 --> 28:24.267
Gawker was sued out of existence

28:24.311 --> 28:25.921
by someone who wanted them
shut down.

28:25.965 --> 28:29.229
That can happen
to a newspaper or a website.

28:29.272 --> 28:32.014
It can't happen to Facebook.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.634
Oh, I forgot you were in here.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.462
Yeah. You don't need
to do those anymore.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.508
We're suing Chumhum now.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.840
Uh, case number 15. Let's go.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.062
Ah!

29:20.106 --> 29:21.368
Five-minute recess.

29:21.411 --> 29:23.674
Don't touch these props, please.

29:23.718 --> 29:25.328
I want to do both.

29:25.372 --> 29:28.157
I want to clerk here, and I want
-to work at Reddick/
-Lockhart.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.811
How many hours can you give me?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.204
What do you need me to do?

29:31.247 --> 29:32.727
Well...

29:32.771 --> 29:34.860
My copyright certificates are...

29:34.903 --> 29:37.558
are catching on with
the fan fiction crowd, and...

29:37.601 --> 29:40.039
I need you to process them.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.781
How much are you charging
for these?

29:42.824 --> 29:45.131
I checked what the Writers Guild
charged for script registration.

29:45.174 --> 29:46.436
-20 bucks.
-You're kidding.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.874
-And how many have you sold?
-412.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.006
-What?
-I know.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.486
It spread online.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.531
But these don't mean anything.

29:54.575 --> 29:55.837
They're just pieces of paper.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.143
What do you think
US copyright is?

29:57.186 --> 30:00.320
Mine is at least good
for 71 years.

30:00.363 --> 30:02.061
That's a year more than US.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.932
Okay, but a plagiarist
can still steal a work.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.804
They can do that
with the US copyright.

30:05.847 --> 30:08.197
They just get sued in court,
like they would in my court.

30:08.241 --> 30:09.416
Oh, my God.

30:09.459 --> 30:12.723
Marissa,
I'm building something here.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.638
I want you to join me.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.205
I want your advice.

30:16.249 --> 30:17.511
I want your advice on cases.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.426
I want to bounce
legal theories off you.

30:19.469 --> 30:21.254
What are your legal theories?

30:21.297 --> 30:24.605
I don't know. That's why
I need to bounce them.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.829
Okay. I can give you
from noon to 2:00 pm,

30:30.872 --> 30:33.179
and 5:00 to 7:00,
if you want it.

30:33.222 --> 30:34.745
Boom.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.747
That's how revolutions are made.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.401
Back rooms of copy shops.

30:38.445 --> 30:39.620
Let's go.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.448
<i>Hey! I'm home.</i>

30:43.015 --> 30:44.538
Kurt?

30:47.106 --> 30:49.935
Some reason
you're sitting in the dark?

30:51.850 --> 30:52.851
No.

30:56.637 --> 30:59.466
You want me to come
and sit with you?

30:59.509 --> 31:02.121
I got a visit
from the FBI today.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.909
Uh, about what?

31:07.953 --> 31:11.478
About the guy I took shooting,
the one in the Wanted poster.

31:14.568 --> 31:17.571
-And what did you tell them?
-Nothing.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.921
This agent wanted me
to give her names

31:19.965 --> 31:21.880
of the other veterans
I took shooting.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.884
Okay, Kurt, listen to me.
I...

31:25.927 --> 31:29.626
I'm your wife, which means
that anything you tell me

31:29.670 --> 31:32.586
is privileged communication.
So...

31:34.022 --> 31:37.721
This is not the time to be
the taciturn mountain man.

31:37.765 --> 31:41.073
Just tell me.
Tell me everything.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.726
About?

31:42.770 --> 31:44.511
Who did you take shooting?

31:45.860 --> 31:47.383
Veterans with PTSD.

31:47.427 --> 31:50.256
I volunteer to shoot with them
on Saturdays.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.822
They're not criminals.

31:51.866 --> 31:55.043
Then just give the FBI
their names and explain that.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.525
One of these veterans
said he was going to D.C.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.266
and he wanted a tour
of the Capitol.

32:00.309 --> 32:03.269
I called the congressional
office to arrange it.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.361
When was this?

32:08.404 --> 32:10.232
On January 5.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.936
Which congressperson?

32:18.719 --> 32:19.981
I'm not gonna say.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.941
Kurt, I can't tell anyone.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.604
I'm not gonna say.

32:39.218 --> 32:40.871
Okay.

32:40.915 --> 32:43.309
You're not gonna talk
to the feds again.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.398
I-I am going to talk to them.

32:45.441 --> 32:48.140
You think I'm in trouble?

32:48.183 --> 32:51.360
Yes. I think you're
a Trump official

32:51.404 --> 32:54.320
who trained an insurrectionist
in firearms.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.582
I didn't train...

32:55.625 --> 32:58.019
And then arranged

32:58.063 --> 32:59.978
for them to scout the Capitol.

33:01.022 --> 33:04.243
I think that's the definition
of trouble.

33:05.940 --> 33:08.551
So here's where I come in.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.945
From this moment on...

33:11.772 --> 33:13.643
I am your lawyer.

33:21.521 --> 33:23.392
Have a seat.

33:23.436 --> 33:24.872
How...

33:24.915 --> 33:26.526
How is your bird problem?

33:26.569 --> 33:28.093
Intermittent.

33:28.136 --> 33:30.834
They put rotors out there,
so the birds won't land.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.575
Makes sense.

33:32.619 --> 33:33.924
Eh, sometimes.

33:33.968 --> 33:35.056
But here we are again.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.884
Yes. This'll be very brief.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.234
I just want you to know
I'm Kurt McVeigh's attorney,

33:39.278 --> 33:42.585
and I need you to not approach
him again without my presence.

33:42.629 --> 33:43.804
You're going to represent him?

33:43.847 --> 33:45.284
-Yes.
-Oh.

33:45.327 --> 33:48.243
That will put such a strain
on the marriage.

33:48.287 --> 33:50.376
Thanks for the concern.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.073
Here's my card.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.423
If you want to interview him
again, just call that number.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.512
-Okay, just so you know,
we're not after Kurt.
-Mm.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.253
-Uh-oh.

33:58.297 --> 33:59.559
What?

33:59.602 --> 34:01.082
The bells.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.606
You might not want
to watch this.

34:05.043 --> 34:05.782
What?

34:07.828 --> 34:10.222
-Oh, my God.

34:10.265 --> 34:11.571
Oh!

34:11.614 --> 34:13.616
The birds haven't quite
caught on to the rotors.

34:13.660 --> 34:16.315
Building maintenance
insists they will eventually,

34:16.358 --> 34:17.620
but I don't know.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.579
-Oh, my... Oh, my God.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.102
Anyway...

34:22.234 --> 34:26.020
Job one, for the FBI, is
identifying and building cases

34:26.064 --> 34:29.110
against as many of the January 6
rioters as possible.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.243
And I-I-I wish you
great success.

34:31.286 --> 34:34.202
As far as I'm concerned, they
all deserve to be locked up.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.725
Well, yes,
given your politics,

34:35.769 --> 34:36.857
I thought you
might be sympathetic.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.815
And job two...

34:38.859 --> 34:40.817
is preventing
the next January 6.

34:40.861 --> 34:43.864
I always looked
at the Conway marriage,

34:43.907 --> 34:46.475
and I wondered how they did it.

34:46.519 --> 34:47.998
Maybe you can tell me sometime.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.000
Good luck with your
investigation.

34:50.044 --> 34:51.785
-Ooh...

34:51.828 --> 34:54.179
You get used to it.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.921
Gunnar Neustadt, former
Chumhum content moderator.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.620
And why are you no longer
at Chumhum?

35:00.663 --> 35:02.361
PTSD.

35:04.058 --> 35:07.409
Uh, what about the work
there was traumatic?

35:07.453 --> 35:09.237
-The churn.
-The churn? What is the churn?

35:09.281 --> 35:11.152
Constant turnover
of bad content.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.241
Some of it sad,
some of it homicidal,

35:13.285 --> 35:15.156
some of it political.
It never stopped.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.680
So, all you did
was block the churn?

35:17.724 --> 35:21.423
No, we also highlighted,
repositioned, featured items.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.685
Oh, in other words,

35:22.729 --> 35:24.034
you did what
a newspaper editor does?

35:24.078 --> 35:25.645
Objection.

35:25.688 --> 35:27.734
Leading.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.346
Overruled.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.131
It felt like I was an editor.

35:33.174 --> 35:37.004
In that you were blocking
violent or pornographic content?

35:37.047 --> 35:38.701
In the sense
that we featured clickbait.

35:38.745 --> 35:42.052
Um, if it sparked anger
or outrage, we featured it.

35:42.096 --> 35:44.185
-That's how the site made money.
Thank you.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.318
Nothing further, Your Honor.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.060
Uh, just one second, Your Honor.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.715
I was at a judge's conference,

35:52.759 --> 35:54.848
and Judge Friend said
that her dad

35:54.891 --> 35:57.764
was a small-town
newspaper editor.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.418
Go after editorial content.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.291
You go for it.

36:03.335 --> 36:07.208
-Why me?
-Because we have
an audience of one.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.731
Wait.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.211
Don't look now.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.648
I haven't questioned
a witness in two years.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.346
Okay. Then it's time.

36:18.393 --> 36:21.570
Mr. Neustadt...

36:21.614 --> 36:23.093
Mr. Neustadt.

36:23.137 --> 36:25.835
How often did you meet
with your team of editors?

36:25.879 --> 36:28.316
Excuse me, moderators.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.450
-Twice a day.
Morning and evening.
-Okay.

36:31.493 --> 36:32.973
Good.

36:33.016 --> 36:35.976
And, uh, what did you discuss
at these meetings?

36:36.019 --> 36:37.151
Which stories were trending.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.415
And by trending, you mean...

36:40.459 --> 36:42.200
Uh, popular,
interesting, newsworthy.

36:42.243 --> 36:43.897
You were assigning value?

36:43.940 --> 36:45.594
Objection.
Counselor is testifying.

36:45.638 --> 36:46.900
Overruled.

36:46.943 --> 36:48.684
Continue, Counselor.

36:48.728 --> 36:51.296
Mr. Neustadt,
if you were deciding

36:51.339 --> 36:53.080
which stories were important,

36:53.123 --> 36:56.126
how is that different
from what an editorial team

36:56.170 --> 36:57.606
at a newspaper does?

36:57.650 --> 37:00.000
Objection. The witness
cannot be expected to know

37:00.043 --> 37:01.871
the inner workings
of a newspaper.

37:01.915 --> 37:04.787
Actually, I worked
in the <i>Tribune</i> Metro section

37:04.831 --> 37:06.485
for three years.

37:20.629 --> 37:22.022
What?

37:22.065 --> 37:23.719
Build-a-Bears.

37:23.763 --> 37:24.764
They were sent to Marissa.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.461
Okay.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.028
-Why?
-No idea.

37:28.071 --> 37:31.249
-This one's a Marissa bear. <i>
-Hug me.</i>

37:35.557 --> 37:38.299
Why don't we, meaning you,

37:38.343 --> 37:40.214
take all these stuffed animals

37:40.258 --> 37:42.042
and put them
in the conference room.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.397
I'm just saying
Mr. Wolfe-Coleman,

37:49.441 --> 37:51.530
this may not be the firm
for you.

37:53.009 --> 37:54.272
Benjamin Dafoe.

37:54.315 --> 37:55.490
One moment.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.187
Please send this out.
-Okay.

37:59.538 --> 38:02.280
I know. I'm putting them
in the conference room.

38:07.546 --> 38:10.026
-Do you have a minute, Marissa?
-Sure.

38:10.070 --> 38:11.854
-Actually, I, um...
-Carmen.

38:11.898 --> 38:13.291
Right, uh,

38:13.334 --> 38:15.380
could you
give us a moment, Carmen?

38:18.557 --> 38:21.908
Why are there hundreds
of teddy bears in our reception?

38:23.039 --> 38:24.563
I...

38:24.606 --> 38:27.870
Is that a legal euphemism
I don't understand?

38:27.914 --> 38:30.351
No. This...

38:30.395 --> 38:32.222
was sent to you.

38:32.266 --> 38:35.443
-It's a Marissa bear. <i>
-Hug me.</i>

38:35.487 --> 38:37.053
That doesn't even look like me.

38:37.097 --> 38:38.359
That would seem to be
beside the point.

38:38.403 --> 38:39.795
What is going on, Marissa?

38:39.839 --> 38:41.580
Why are there hundreds of bears
in our office?

38:41.623 --> 38:43.277
Let me find out.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.062
Well, if you're finding out,
you must have some suspicion.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.368
So, what is it?

38:47.412 --> 38:49.239
I offered some advice
to a client

38:49.283 --> 38:50.850
who was buying
a Build-A-Bear franchise.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.200
-My guess is this
was a thank you.
-What client?

38:53.243 --> 38:54.897
You're not a lawyer.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.508
Why do you have clients?

39:00.425 --> 39:01.513
Oh, my God.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.384
This is about
that Copy Coop court?

39:03.428 --> 39:05.995
I made sure it didn't interfere
with my responsibilities.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.171
Marissa, no.

39:08.215 --> 39:10.391
By participating in that
simulacrum of a courtroom,

39:10.435 --> 39:13.176
you exposed this firm
to malpractice, sanctions,

39:13.220 --> 39:14.526
and God knows what.

39:14.569 --> 39:16.702
I'm just offering the judge
some advice,

39:16.745 --> 39:18.486
and helping him
with his copyright office.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.141
If you wish to continue
your employment at this firm,

39:21.184 --> 39:23.099
you will never do
anything like that again.

39:23.143 --> 39:24.100
-Do you understand?
-But it's...

39:24.144 --> 39:26.102
No. No buts.

39:26.146 --> 39:28.104
Do you understand?

39:29.497 --> 39:30.542
I do.

39:31.804 --> 39:35.024
Diane, your husband
and the FBI are here.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.374
Oh, no.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.418
Don't put them
in the conference room.

39:37.462 --> 39:39.507
I... Okay.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.988
I think I might be
a little late.

39:50.083 --> 39:51.432
Do we all get one?

39:51.476 --> 39:53.303
Or just clients?

39:56.829 --> 39:58.091
Wow.

39:58.134 --> 40:01.790
There's that, uh,
calming, unnerving quiet.

40:05.620 --> 40:06.795
-Hello.
-Hi

40:06.839 --> 40:09.058
I have agreed
to a ten-minute interview.

40:09.102 --> 40:11.583
Mr. McVeigh has to get
back to work.

40:11.626 --> 40:12.888
Yes. Yes, I know.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.629
And he's been a good boy,
not saying a thing.

40:14.673 --> 40:15.630
He's not a boy.

40:15.674 --> 40:18.416
No, he's not,
your boy, Bill.

40:19.634 --> 40:21.114
Okay. Let's start.

40:21.157 --> 40:23.943
Just to be formal, Kurt,
I'm Agent Starkey with the FBI.

40:25.510 --> 40:28.382
We understand. We don't need
the musical introduction.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.211
Okay. Um... So, Kurt.

40:31.254 --> 40:34.214
Those friends or your colleagues

40:34.257 --> 40:35.824
or whatever they are to you,
or were to you,

40:35.868 --> 40:38.044
probably have little
or no criminal liability

40:38.087 --> 40:40.002
for January 6.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.527
My concern
isn't with their past.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.398
It's what they might do
in the future.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.052
He has no knowledge of that.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.489
Well, now that they've gotten
away with, say, trespassing,

40:48.533 --> 40:51.927
or smearing their feces
on the floor of the rotunda,

40:51.971 --> 40:54.016
they're emboldened to violence,

40:54.060 --> 40:56.366
to bombs, to hostage taking.

41:00.327 --> 41:02.677
Does Kurt have a question?

41:02.721 --> 41:05.027
-No, but I do.
-Oh. Pray, ask.

41:05.071 --> 41:06.289
Why do you think that?

41:06.333 --> 41:08.248
Why do I think
they're emboldened?

41:08.291 --> 41:09.510
Well, I have my reasons.

41:09.554 --> 41:11.773
And if you tell me who they are,

41:11.817 --> 41:15.516
I will know and then,
if need be, I can stop them.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.084
My client has no knowledge
of anyone plotting anything.

41:18.127 --> 41:21.043
Well, that does not square

41:21.087 --> 41:23.219
with this Dylan Pike statement.

41:23.263 --> 41:26.135
"Kurt McVeigh not only
trained me in firearms,

41:26.179 --> 41:29.704
"he also laid out the strategy
for entering and occupying

41:29.748 --> 41:31.793
the U.S. Capitol."

41:39.758 --> 41:41.499
Was that a comment?

41:41.542 --> 41:43.326
No. I have a comment.

41:43.370 --> 41:46.286
-Oh, come on. Bullshit.

41:54.990 --> 41:56.470
Wow.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.081
I'm surprised Mr. Pike
didn't accuse Kurt

41:59.125 --> 42:00.561
of being responsible for 9/11.

42:00.605 --> 42:02.563
Certainly you have
a better joke than that.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.913
No. This isn't a joke to me.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.742
Dylan Pike will say anything
to reduce his sentence.

42:07.786 --> 42:10.702
I do consider his statement
with some skepticism.

42:10.745 --> 42:14.444
And the only way to get to
the truth is with a grand jury.

42:14.488 --> 42:18.579
Uh, a subpoena has a tendency
to sharpen the senses.

42:18.623 --> 42:20.059
Odd you don't have
a musical cue for that.

42:20.102 --> 42:21.060
Hold on.

42:22.365 --> 42:24.629
Oops. That's not right.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.110
I can always subpoena you,
Kurt.

42:36.728 --> 42:38.947
He's a rapist.
An accused rapist.

42:38.991 --> 42:41.471
God, I'm amazed I have to say
this in a room full of lawyers.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.952
Since when are we representing
people like Wolfe-Coleman?

42:43.996 --> 42:45.432
He's the next Jeffrey Epstein.

42:45.475 --> 42:46.781
Did you approve this,
Liz?
-No.

42:46.825 --> 42:49.131
This is the first
that I am hearing of this.

42:49.175 --> 42:50.524
So it was Diane.
Diane approved this.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.786
No. I...

42:51.830 --> 42:53.135
Well, I don't know.

42:53.179 --> 42:55.485
I have clients who will flee
when they find out

42:55.529 --> 42:57.749
we represent this rapist.

42:57.792 --> 42:59.881
Oh, you mean like the
Women's Coalition? Big loss.

42:59.925 --> 43:01.274
I know, the teddy bears.

43:01.317 --> 43:03.189
-I'm working on it.
-No, no, no.

43:03.232 --> 43:05.626
Did you approve us representing
Craig Wolfe-Coleman?

43:05.670 --> 43:06.888
No. Why?

43:06.932 --> 43:08.629
-Do we represent him?
-Apparently, we do.

43:08.673 --> 43:10.500
And we're-we're just trying
to get to the bottom of it.

43:10.544 --> 43:12.154
Without the other name partner?

43:12.198 --> 43:13.939
That's why we asked you in.

43:13.982 --> 43:15.331
Well, this isn't me.

43:15.375 --> 43:16.637
I mean, was he here?

43:16.681 --> 43:18.944
-Hi. Maybe I can help.
David.

43:18.987 --> 43:20.423
What's going on?

43:20.467 --> 43:22.338
Uh, one of the associates,
the new one...

43:22.382 --> 43:24.123
-Marissa?
-No, the real one.

43:24.166 --> 43:25.646
-Carmen?
-Right.

43:25.690 --> 43:28.127
She pulled in Wolfe-Coleman
as a client.

43:28.170 --> 43:29.563
-Carmen?
Why?

43:29.607 --> 43:30.651
Because...

43:30.695 --> 43:31.870
Wait, why don't I go upstairs

43:31.913 --> 43:33.349
and get your
last quarterly report.

43:33.393 --> 43:34.829
Oh, come on, David.

43:34.873 --> 43:36.744
If Gavin Firth wants to talk
to us about money,

43:36.788 --> 43:38.354
he should discuss it
with the partners.

43:38.398 --> 43:40.269
Actually, Gavin was called
back to London.

43:40.313 --> 43:41.531
I'm the new Gavin.

43:41.575 --> 43:45.623
STR Laurie made me
your new boss.

43:45.666 --> 43:47.102
Hi.

43:47.146 --> 43:48.669
And this is what I have to say.

43:48.713 --> 43:51.890
More of you should be out there
digging up new clients

43:51.933 --> 43:53.413
like this new Carmen girl.

43:53.456 --> 43:54.893
Two months out of law school,

43:54.936 --> 43:57.417
and she's got
our top two clients.

43:57.460 --> 43:59.375
Think about it.

44:03.249 --> 44:05.730
Can I talk to you for a second?

44:08.036 --> 44:09.821
That's bad.

44:09.864 --> 44:11.953
-David as our boss.
-Yeah.

44:11.997 --> 44:15.043
Yeah, but, I-- you know,
I have a worse worry.

44:15.087 --> 44:16.392
Okay?

44:16.436 --> 44:18.612
We were griping
about a new client,

44:18.656 --> 44:21.615
and two minutes later,
David Lee comes running down

44:21.659 --> 44:23.225
the stairs to talk to us.

44:23.269 --> 44:25.314
That's quite a coincidence.

44:27.142 --> 44:28.666
You think he bugged your office?

44:28.709 --> 44:30.711
I don't know.
You know him better than I do.

44:30.755 --> 44:31.712
Would he do something
like that?

44:31.756 --> 44:33.758
-Oh, yeah.
-Great.

44:34.759 --> 44:35.585
So what do we do?

44:35.629 --> 44:37.718
Have Jay look for bugs.

44:37.762 --> 44:40.242
At night,
when we can hide it from David.

44:40.286 --> 44:41.679
God.

44:41.722 --> 44:43.681
If we actually spent
this much time lawyering,

44:43.724 --> 44:46.771
we'd be Supreme Court justices
by now.

44:46.814 --> 44:48.990
Oh, wait.
What is, what is going on

44:49.034 --> 44:50.818
with all the teddy bears
in the conference room?

44:50.862 --> 44:53.778
It's a long story.

44:54.648 --> 44:56.084
If it's actually prejudicial,
than even telling me

44:56.128 --> 44:57.651
what it is will prejudice me.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.609
But I don't think it
is prejudicial. All I wanted...

44:59.653 --> 45:02.177
No. No. You say another
word and I'll judge against you.

45:02.221 --> 45:04.092
Here's what I'll allow you.

45:04.136 --> 45:06.878
Four words to explain
why it's not prejudicial.

45:06.921 --> 45:09.358
You go over that,
I'll rule for the other side.

45:09.402 --> 45:11.621
-Your Honor...
-Hey! There's two.

45:11.665 --> 45:13.101
Can I have those two back?

45:13.145 --> 45:14.624
No, but you now have six.

45:15.625 --> 45:18.454
Patent claim...

45:18.498 --> 45:21.196
-requires background.
-Two more words.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.416
Of prior work.

45:23.459 --> 45:24.852
Nope. Three words.
Ruling for the defendant.

45:24.896 --> 45:27.637
Your patent is approved, sir.
Go with God.

45:27.681 --> 45:29.378
Wait. Shake hands.
Look at each other and say,

45:29.422 --> 45:31.467
"I respect and I love you."

45:31.511 --> 45:33.774
No, no, no, no, no.

45:33.818 --> 45:35.471
That's not how
we do things here, sir.

45:35.515 --> 45:38.953
Due to the Bad Loser Law
of last Wednesday,

45:38.997 --> 45:40.476
the ruling is reversed.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.782
Judgement for the plaintiff.

45:41.826 --> 45:44.306
-Yes!
-Don't you dare celebrate, sir.

45:44.350 --> 45:46.613
Thank you, Your Honor.

45:46.656 --> 45:48.136
There's my law clerk.

45:48.180 --> 45:50.704
Recess for ten minutes.

45:54.621 --> 45:56.754
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

45:58.843 --> 45:59.974
Why not?

46:00.018 --> 46:01.062
My boss said no.

46:02.585 --> 46:04.544
You don't need me anyway.

46:04.587 --> 46:06.720
Let me connect you
with a real lawyer.

46:08.026 --> 46:09.331
Marissa, listen to me.

46:09.375 --> 46:11.769
I asked you for a reason.

46:11.812 --> 46:14.815
You know just enough not
to crush what I'm doing here.

46:16.774 --> 46:19.428
A real lawyer will look
for reasons why not.

46:20.473 --> 46:23.389
I need someone
to look for reasons why.

46:24.172 --> 46:26.131
I can find you someone.

46:26.174 --> 46:27.872
I don't want someone.

46:38.752 --> 46:40.754
All rise.

46:49.632 --> 46:51.504
Ms. Reddick,

46:51.547 --> 46:54.724
you made an original
and compelling argument.

46:54.768 --> 46:56.857
And Your Honor, Judge Cain,

46:56.901 --> 46:59.817
-I always thought
you got a raw deal...
-Your Honor.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.428
You don't want to interrupt me,
Counselor.

47:02.471 --> 47:04.865
I have to admit, I am baffled.

47:04.909 --> 47:08.782
How can it be that Chumhum
gets away with something

47:08.826 --> 47:11.567
any newspaper
would go under for doing?

47:11.611 --> 47:14.657
Unfortunately...

47:14.701 --> 47:16.572
the law is the law.

47:16.616 --> 47:18.748
It may be unfair,

47:18.792 --> 47:21.055
but it is constitutional.

47:21.099 --> 47:23.579
Section 230 stands,

47:23.623 --> 47:26.365
and the statute ties my hands.

47:37.724 --> 47:39.552
-Mr. Cord.

47:41.336 --> 47:43.904
Ace or Queen?

47:43.948 --> 47:44.905
Queen.

47:44.949 --> 47:46.559
Good.

47:46.602 --> 47:49.649
I just stopped by to thank you
for your efforts, Ms. Reddick.

47:49.692 --> 47:52.826
And to tell you that I'm quite
prepared to bankroll an appeal.

47:52.870 --> 47:56.917
Uh, well, we are happy
to handle the appeal for you

47:56.961 --> 47:59.180
if that's what
you would like, but, um...

47:59.224 --> 48:02.140
Uh, you should know
that it is probably a long shot.

48:02.183 --> 48:04.794
Long shots have come through
for me before.

48:04.838 --> 48:07.145
You know, I have wicked
arthritis in my hands,

48:07.188 --> 48:08.624
and my doctor told me,

48:08.668 --> 48:10.931
"Well, just squeeze
a rubber ball all day,"

48:10.975 --> 48:13.629
but instead,
I picked up a book of magic.

48:15.022 --> 48:17.938
Now, I've identified
27 potential lawsuits

48:17.982 --> 48:20.375
that I think might be viable.
They're tricky,

48:20.419 --> 48:22.812
but, uh, they've got potential.

48:22.856 --> 48:24.249
And if you win,

48:24.292 --> 48:26.686
the world just becomes
a little more bearable.

48:26.729 --> 48:28.993
-Hmm.
-And, uh...

48:29.036 --> 48:31.473
we are the firm that you want?

48:31.517 --> 48:33.301
Oh, most definitely.

48:33.345 --> 48:34.868
Talk to you soon.

48:35.651 --> 48:38.002
Carmen, can I have a second?

48:38.045 --> 48:39.177
Yes.

48:39.220 --> 48:41.179
No, I'll go. It's my turn.

48:45.183 --> 48:47.794
You're representing
Craig Wolfe-Coleman?

48:47.837 --> 48:49.665
I think I am.

48:49.709 --> 48:51.493
Did you pursue him?

48:51.537 --> 48:52.973
Of course not.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.323
You know what he's accused of?

48:55.367 --> 48:58.413
Yes, I looked over
the case last night.

48:58.457 --> 49:00.154
And it doesn't bother you?

49:00.198 --> 49:01.764
I...

49:01.808 --> 49:03.984
Uh, I don't--
I don't understand.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.638
Should it?

49:05.681 --> 49:09.598
Carmen, is-is-is there anyone
that you would not represent?

49:09.642 --> 49:11.861
Wouldn't?

49:11.905 --> 49:13.863
I... I don't understand,

49:13.907 --> 49:17.345
is... is there someone
you don't want me to represent?

49:17.389 --> 49:19.260
Okay. Uh, no. I'm just...

49:19.304 --> 49:22.568
I'm just trying to get
a sense of who you are.

49:22.611 --> 49:25.005
Is there anyone?

49:25.049 --> 49:26.833
Someone?

49:28.226 --> 49:29.575
Alan Dershowitz.

49:29.618 --> 49:31.664
Why?

49:31.707 --> 49:33.579
I don't know.

49:33.622 --> 49:34.972
I don't like him.

49:37.104 --> 49:38.976
Okay, um...

49:39.019 --> 49:40.847
All right, here's what I want.

49:40.890 --> 49:42.457
As your mentor,

49:42.501 --> 49:45.721
I'm going to help you with
the Craig Wolfe-Coleman case.

49:45.765 --> 49:46.853
Thank you.

49:46.896 --> 49:48.724
And I want us to keep talking

49:48.768 --> 49:49.899
about your career path.

49:49.943 --> 49:51.684
Are-are you worried about me?

49:53.164 --> 49:55.993
I don't know what
I am about you.

50:04.131 --> 50:05.698
Mr. Wackner.

50:05.741 --> 50:07.265
What a surprise.

50:07.308 --> 50:09.093
Ms. Lockhart. Hi.

50:10.442 --> 50:12.357
I love your decor.

50:14.098 --> 50:16.448
I'm always surprised,
people come in my courtroom,

50:16.491 --> 50:17.884
and they're shocked.

50:17.927 --> 50:19.929
They think, "Oh, my God,
it's so informal."

50:19.973 --> 50:22.062
-What can I do for you, sir?
-I want to hire you.

50:22.106 --> 50:24.586
-You want to...
-Hire you, your firm.

50:24.630 --> 50:27.546
I did my research, and I'm
willing to pay your retainer.

50:27.589 --> 50:28.938
-Are you being sued?
-No.

50:28.982 --> 50:30.418
I'm creating a courtroom,

50:30.462 --> 50:33.421
and I need to know
what is the best way to do it.

50:33.465 --> 50:34.770
Well, we don't do that, sir.

50:34.814 --> 50:36.598
-But you do try to make money?
-We do.

50:36.642 --> 50:38.600
I'm willing to pay money.

50:38.644 --> 50:40.298
I looked online.

50:40.341 --> 50:43.214
One of your services
is consultation on legal issues.

50:43.257 --> 50:46.869
Your website is incredibly
insistent on that.

50:46.913 --> 50:49.481
Well, I need consultation,
and I'm willing to pay.

50:49.524 --> 50:52.223
Mr. Wackner, I...

50:53.224 --> 50:55.400
I don't like what you're doing.

50:55.443 --> 50:56.749
I know.

50:56.792 --> 50:59.447
And I'm not trying
to convince you.

50:59.491 --> 51:01.667
I'm using your skepticism,

51:01.710 --> 51:04.452
and the incentive of capitalism,

51:04.496 --> 51:06.715
uh...

51:06.759 --> 51:10.110
to acquire your services
to, um...

51:10.154 --> 51:13.853
perfect my little clubhouse
of the law.

51:14.680 --> 51:16.812
I want you,

51:16.856 --> 51:19.076
and I want Marissa to help me.

51:21.513 --> 51:23.819
Our retainer is not, uh,

51:23.863 --> 51:24.907
it-it's sizable.

51:24.951 --> 51:26.039
Well, I got money.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.954
Why are you doing this, sir?

51:27.997 --> 51:29.477
It's not gonna benefit you.

51:29.521 --> 51:32.132
It's odd.

51:32.176 --> 51:35.309
I'm gonna talk
for a while, so...

51:35.353 --> 51:37.311
just let me.

51:37.355 --> 51:39.922
Since the '80s,

51:39.966 --> 51:41.968
people have been
discussing everything

51:42.011 --> 51:47.016
as if it's built on what can
benefit or disadvantage.

51:47.060 --> 51:49.976
But do you remember
a time before that?

51:50.019 --> 51:53.501
People used to want to write
the great American novel

51:53.545 --> 51:54.894
and not sell out.

51:54.937 --> 51:57.505
Build a beach sculpture.

51:57.549 --> 52:00.160
Fly to Ecuador, help people.

52:00.204 --> 52:03.076
Can you remember the last time

52:03.120 --> 52:06.253
you heard those words,

52:06.297 --> 52:08.864
"Peace Corps"?

52:08.908 --> 52:10.866
I do.

52:10.910 --> 52:14.740
I want a new Peace Corps.

52:14.783 --> 52:17.003
For America.

52:22.791 --> 52:28.188
I'll have downstairs draw up
a... a retainer agreement.

52:29.537 --> 52:31.322
Good.

52:31.365 --> 52:32.584
Can I take a bear?

52:32.627 --> 52:34.542
Oh, please do.

52:34.586 --> 52:37.458
Um, take two.

52:38.851 --> 52:41.332
-Thank you very much.
-Hmm.

52:45.510 --> 52:47.120
Hold the door.

52:49.427 --> 52:51.255
Here, take one.
