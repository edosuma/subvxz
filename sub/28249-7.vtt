WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:05.657
Previously on "The Village".

00:05.701 --> 00:07.007
I got the digits. Yes!

00:07.050 --> 00:08.660
Ava needs a favor
from your father.

00:08.704 --> 00:10.010
Sofia Lopez.

00:10.053 --> 00:11.837
The same Sofia Lopez
who's suing me?

00:11.881 --> 00:13.100
Good to see you, son.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.381
I came here to take
my daughter home.

00:14.405 --> 00:15.493
Dad...

00:15.537 --> 00:16.857
You stay the hell away from her.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.977
I've been having some PTSD.
Wouldn't wanna spook you.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.023
Are you in love with him?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.348
- We're family.
- We're not family.

00:24.372 --> 00:25.653
You're just the person
who got my husband killed.

00:25.677 --> 00:28.550
I think I met a woman
I can give my baby to.

00:28.593 --> 00:31.422
She really wants a baby
because she lost hers.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.295
Do your worst, pal.

00:37.428 --> 00:40.170
You said my dad was
a firefighter on 9/11.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.693
Yes or no? Mom?

00:41.737 --> 00:42.868
Yes.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.522
You knew where he was
this whole time?

00:44.566 --> 00:46.089
17 years?

00:52.139 --> 00:55.185
Hey, baby,
what are you doing now?

00:55.229 --> 00:57.100
A girl's gotta eat.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.059
A girl's gotta get back
to her mother.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.538
As soon as she's done eating.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.627
You're playing grandma.

01:02.671 --> 01:06.240
I am negotiating a peace...

01:06.283 --> 01:07.763
while playing grandma.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.076
What did you do with Hansel?

01:16.119 --> 01:17.686
You've got to keep
your strength up.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.905
Am I wrestling someone?

01:19.949 --> 01:24.214
No, but you are talking
to your mom today.

01:24.258 --> 01:26.999
Actually, I was planning
on moving the rest of my stuff

01:27.043 --> 01:28.305
down here today.

01:28.349 --> 01:30.002
You barely use that dining room.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.308
It's been a week.

01:31.352 --> 01:34.137
You can't punish
your mother forever, honey.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.096
She lied about who my father was

01:36.139 --> 01:37.160
and then moved the deadbeat

01:37.184 --> 01:38.464
who ditched us
into our building.

01:39.621 --> 01:40.989
She's lucky I don't call
child services.

01:41.013 --> 01:42.406
They'd call a social worker.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.365
Patricia Davis.
Nice to meet you.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.932
The system is rigged.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.456
Patricia.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.334
Olivia? What's wrong?

01:57.378 --> 01:58.944
My father kicked me out.

01:58.988 --> 02:01.773
I was hoping
I could stay with you.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.645
Regular orphanage.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.912
Katie, I'd like you
to meet Olivia.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.435
Olivia's our granddaughter.

02:13.481 --> 02:14.481
Hey.

02:15.831 --> 02:16.832
Hey.

02:16.875 --> 02:17.876
Um...

02:17.920 --> 02:19.487
Okay, take her bag...

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.808 --> 02:38.854
- Good morning.
- Is it?

02:38.897 --> 02:41.857
Not particularly.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.946
Um, I'll come back.

02:43.989 --> 02:46.905
It's fine.

02:46.949 --> 02:47.993
Your eye looks better.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.386
Well...

02:49.430 --> 02:51.649
time heals all wounds, right?

02:51.693 --> 02:53.999
Well, I guess we should look
at the bright side.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.176
Some kids run a whole city away.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.003
She only went three floors.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.180
Her bed's just as empty.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.921
Not a peep?

03:02.965 --> 03:04.314
I got a note.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.925
Apparently we're meeting
with adoptive parents

03:06.969 --> 03:09.232
before school this morning.

03:09.276 --> 03:11.495
Communication's a good sign.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.019
She signed it, "Your
former daughter Katherine".

03:14.063 --> 03:16.631
No, she's just trying to sting.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.025
Success.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.245
And now I get to convince
rich people

03:22.289 --> 03:24.247
who did everything right
with their lives

03:24.291 --> 03:26.945
to take
my furious teenager's baby.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.034
What's Patricia saying?

03:29.078 --> 03:31.472
Katie's mad at me for lying,

03:31.515 --> 03:33.517
and you for abandoning us

03:33.561 --> 03:36.041
when you found out
I was pregnant.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.765
Wait, she doesn't know
you never told me?

03:38.827 --> 03:41.743
I've always said you left.
I never said when.

03:41.786 --> 03:42.961
- I was going to...
- Don't.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.877
Don't.
Um, yeah, I'll take the hit.

03:45.921 --> 03:47.836
I broke up with you
and enlisted.

03:47.879 --> 03:48.924
Gone is gone.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.208
Well, not telling her
is what got me into this mess

03:52.232 --> 03:54.016
in the first place.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.193
Katie?

03:59.413 --> 04:00.849
That's what you're wearing?

04:08.813 --> 04:10.119
This is ridiculous.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.903
You have all day to shave.
I'm late.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.427
Ben was on the night shift.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.622
I asked him to pick me up
a bagel so I could hit him up

04:15.646 --> 04:18.475
- for a ride.
- Pops, he's a cop.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.956
My tax dollars at work.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.305
Where you going?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.176
To throw pebbles
on my love's window.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.527
We've been courting,
but only over the phone.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.665
You look sharp.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.191
You got school?

04:39.235 --> 04:40.932
First day back at the internship

04:40.976 --> 04:42.194
since Dad lost his mind.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.283
That'll be fun.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.415
One month till I graduate.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.504
We can survive anything
for a month, right?

04:47.548 --> 04:48.988
Unless you're deported
to a country

04:49.027 --> 04:51.421
that's branded you a dissident.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.989
I'm gonna go warm up
my throwing arm.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.481
They're coming up.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.311
Don't look so awkward.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.529
I didn't know I was.

05:15.837 --> 05:17.447
It's a beautiful home.

05:17.491 --> 05:20.407
Playroom downstairs is bigger
than our apartment.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.323
Sounds nice.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.152
It's, Claire and Matt, right?

05:27.196 --> 05:30.068
Max. Claire and Max.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.378
What are you doing? Mom, stop.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.206
I'm sorry.

05:38.642 --> 05:40.340
This woman has been
through a lot.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.621
If she thinks we're not
on the same page,

05:41.645 --> 05:43.604
she's not gonna put herself
through this.

05:43.647 --> 05:45.997
We're not on the same page,
Katie.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.738
We are about adoption.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.456
When we're through here,
I need you to talk

05:50.480 --> 05:51.699
to me about Nick.

05:51.742 --> 05:53.222
There is nothing to talk about.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.678
You wanna forgive him
for ditching you

05:54.702 --> 05:55.983
when you were pregnant,
go for it.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.313
I'm not interested.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.117
He didn't know
I was pregnant when he left.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.927
What?

06:02.971 --> 06:05.277
I was hurt and I was angry,

06:05.321 --> 06:06.670
so I never told him.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.198
I hate you.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.163
My God. I'm so sorry we're late.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.270
Did the doorman let you in okay?

06:22.294 --> 06:23.687
Yeah, all good.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.167
We come bearing baked goods.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.647
- Hello!
- Hey.

06:26.690 --> 06:29.040
- Hi.
- So good to see you guys.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.174
Hi. Max.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.481
- Hi. Sarah.
- I'm Claire.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.699
Hi.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.578
That doesn't make sense.

06:44.621 --> 06:45.405
Why would he keep her from us

06:45.448 --> 06:46.667
for 19 years

06:46.710 --> 06:49.060
and then suddenly drive her
into our arms?

06:49.104 --> 06:51.585
Because he is vindictive.

06:51.628 --> 06:53.587
Whose side are you taking?

06:53.630 --> 06:55.110
An hour ago, you were telling me

06:55.153 --> 06:56.459
to send Katie back
to her mother.

06:56.503 --> 06:57.721
How is this any different?

06:57.765 --> 07:00.550
Because Sarah did not
kick Katie out.

07:00.594 --> 07:04.249
Baby, I would love
to take that girl in,

07:04.293 --> 07:06.817
but this is a powder keg.

07:09.559 --> 07:11.779
So what are we supposed to do?

07:12.997 --> 07:18.307
I will talk to her.
You will talk to Gordon.

07:18.350 --> 07:19.830
And why would I do that?

07:19.874 --> 07:22.180
Because she may be banking
on the fact that you won't.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.495
This place is incredible.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.062
How long have you been here?

07:34.105 --> 07:35.411
Five years.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.326
The first two,
it was a war zone.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.632
Literally camping.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.678
Well, not literally.
We renovated.

07:42.679 --> 07:45.116
Katie said you were very kind

07:45.160 --> 07:46.553
when her friend introduced you.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.381
I think that friend
was matchmaking a bit,

07:49.425 --> 07:51.514
but please know
I didn't have any idea.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.863
Of course.

07:52.907 --> 07:54.517
I did know
what a talented artist

07:54.561 --> 07:57.477
Katie was from our
mutual friend's photographs.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.652
What photographs?

07:58.695 --> 08:00.828
All I did was crochet a heart.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.526
Claire's work was
at the Venice Biennale.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.832
Neat.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.530
Mom, it's
a massive accomplishment.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.663
If you're an art nerd.

08:09.706 --> 08:13.101
Katie tells me you've
always wanted to go to Italy.

08:13.144 --> 08:15.799
Someday, maybe.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.716
So, you're thinking of adopting.

08:21.109 --> 08:23.807
Cautiously, yeah.

08:25.243 --> 08:28.203
In all honesty,
Katie showing up here felt

08:28.246 --> 08:29.813
a little bit like fate.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.210
Well, we both want this.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.256
- You asked for coffee.
- No, it's fine.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.216
It's already in the carafe.
Just two seconds.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.174
She's a bit of a Martha Stewart.

08:44.785 --> 08:47.396
I will grab some cream
and sugar.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.180
Hey.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.421
You know, it's called a bus.

09:12.464 --> 09:13.616
Takes you anywhere
you want to go.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.729
- It's also called flu season.
- Yeah.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.253
Can I see your gun?
Absolutely not.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.300
How many perps
you tackle last night?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.780
Zero.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.434
What's the point
of working graveyard

09:25.477 --> 09:26.870
if you don't see action?

09:27.915 --> 09:29.394
Ava went upstate with Sami,

09:29.438 --> 09:31.309
so I've been a little sleepless.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.618
I heard Gabey cut bait on her.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.751
Yeah, she understood,

09:37.794 --> 09:41.276
and Sophia's great, but looks
like it might not matter.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.801
Yeah, a bunch of people
picked up before Ava

09:44.845 --> 09:47.804
for the same offense
had their hearings last week,

09:47.848 --> 09:49.719
and almost all of them
are getting deported,

09:49.763 --> 09:51.808
at least the ones that
aren't married to citizens.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.898
Maybe you should propose.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.161
I already did.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.164
To my first wife.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.167
Never technically got divorced.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.304
Here.

10:09.347 --> 10:10.653
You can wear the hat.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.406
You're here.

10:24.449 --> 10:25.688
You didn't give me much choice.

10:25.712 --> 10:26.756
Hop up.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.366
You're joining me
in the meeting.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.240
- Now?
- Right now.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.205
Miss Lopez.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.034
You know my son.

10:45.688 --> 10:46.689
We've met.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.851
Hey, Ron? Anybody here?

11:22.507 --> 11:24.814
Sorry. We're not open yet.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.424
Door was unlocked.

11:34.476 --> 11:36.304
Miss Lopez,
what you're showing me

11:36.347 --> 11:37.218
are a spattering of evictions

11:37.261 --> 11:38.436
in different buildings

11:38.480 --> 11:40.003
over a 12-month period.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.764
All of them holdouts amongst
a larger group being bought up

11:41.788 --> 11:42.919
by your client.

11:42.963 --> 11:45.182
Evictions are approved
by the court system.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.749
There are thousands.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.230
And yet all of these happened
to have been signed off on

11:49.273 --> 11:50.971
by the same two city officials.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.581
You're barking up
the wrong tree.

11:52.624 --> 11:53.732
Pretty sure you wouldn't use
the word barking

11:53.756 --> 11:54.844
if I were a man.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.213
Pretty sure I'd
say something worse.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.673
Why would you do this?

11:57.717 --> 11:59.544
Why would you sit me
across from her?

11:59.588 --> 12:01.633
So you can see what
futility looks like.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.767
I'm pretty clear on futility.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.377
And what is that
supposed to mean?

12:06.421 --> 12:08.640
I'm done.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.251
I quit.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.470
You know what they'll think?
Your future employers?

12:12.514 --> 12:15.299
Yeah, that I couldn't hack it
at my own father's firm.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.866
Nobody hires a quitter, son.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.627
Of all the things
you could have said

12:19.651 --> 12:20.651
to keep me...

12:30.401 --> 12:32.012
They seem like nice people.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.799
If you're serious about them,
I think we should

12:36.843 --> 12:39.193
probably get a lawyer.
I'll figure it out.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.543
This is a big decision, Katie.

12:41.586 --> 12:42.936
We need to talk it through.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.807
Or I could just make it
on a whim.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.244
I mean, screw the kid.
It's all about me.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.551
I begged Nick to stay.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.728
He broke up with me
and enlisted.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.471
I didn't want you to have
a father who didn't want you.

12:56.514 --> 13:01.345
He didn't want you.
He didn't even know about me.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.220
Katie.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.833
Subway's this way.

13:10.877 --> 13:12.704
You need to go to school.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.671
To the right, the right. Yeah.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.718
Did I hit it?

13:26.762 --> 13:28.459
I'm thinking we try the buzzer.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.374
Romeo didn't use a buzzer.

13:30.418 --> 13:31.941
Romeo ended up dead,

13:31.985 --> 13:33.029
and we might be, too,

13:33.073 --> 13:34.683
by the time you hit this window.

13:34.726 --> 13:38.643
Enzo. What are you doing here?

13:38.687 --> 13:43.257
Gwendolina Ferrari,
I'd like to ask

13:43.300 --> 13:47.435
for your company in,

13:47.478 --> 13:48.871
a night you'll never forget.

13:48.915 --> 13:52.092
Dinner, music, dancing.

13:52.135 --> 13:56.444
- And an officer escort?
- Afraid I'll be clocked out.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.446
The subway will do just fine.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.013
Is that a yes?

14:00.056 --> 14:02.450
I thought you'd never ask.

14:10.153 --> 14:13.026
Hey, I saw we were short
a few things after the weekend.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.766
Those stairs are narrow.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.291
I don't want you
bringing stuff down.

14:17.334 --> 14:18.422
But I'm bionic.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.905
Look, I appreciate you
taking the initiative.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.473
Don't suppose you want to,
return the favor

14:25.516 --> 14:26.866
and send Katie home?

14:27.736 --> 14:30.130
- Mom's pretty distraught.
- Yeah?

14:30.173 --> 14:31.522
How's her father?

14:33.002 --> 14:35.265
Kicking himself
for not telling her

14:35.309 --> 14:37.180
when he had the chance.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.399
No, I feel awful,

14:38.442 --> 14:41.097
but yeah, I'm just trying
to stay clear

14:41.141 --> 14:44.492
and give Sarah room to navigate.

14:44.535 --> 14:46.015
We're on it.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.106
I-I'll take over.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.368
All right.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.111
You have to tell her
to come home.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.940
But you're the one
who asked her to leave.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.116
Is that what she told you?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.640
Look, if you want to hate me
for what happened

15:02.684 --> 15:06.253
with your mother,
then that's your choice,

15:06.296 --> 15:09.473
but destroying
your relationship with Olivia

15:09.517 --> 15:11.867
just because she wants
to know me...

15:11.911 --> 15:15.218
This has nothing to do
with you or Patricia.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.959
It's between me and my daughter.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.830
She's in my house now,

15:18.874 --> 15:21.921
so I guess it's between
you and me.

15:21.964 --> 15:26.490
You finally got
some leverage, old man?

15:28.579 --> 15:30.190
You gonna hold her hostage?

15:30.233 --> 15:34.542
Make me forgive you
before you send her back?

15:34.585 --> 15:37.980
Give me one good reason
I should.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.460
I'll give you ten.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.681
I feel slightly uncomfortable
you're not in school.

15:43.725 --> 15:46.771
I feel like somebody dropped
a bowling ball on my bladder.

15:46.815 --> 15:47.947
Suck it up.

15:47.990 --> 15:51.298
Can I play devil's advocate?

15:51.341 --> 15:53.015
You didn't tell your mother
you were pregnant

15:53.039 --> 15:55.345
because you were terrified
of what might happen.

15:55.389 --> 15:56.912
For a few weeks.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.629
And you chose to withhold
who the father was.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.394
From her, not my kid.

16:00.437 --> 16:01.612
You're splitting hairs.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.920
You're supposed
to be on my side.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.662
We're all terrified
our deepest truth

16:07.705 --> 16:09.359
might strip away
what little we have

16:09.403 --> 16:10.795
of the things we love.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.580
Hey, thanks for the meme.

16:12.623 --> 16:14.234
Also, I don't buy that.

16:16.018 --> 16:19.108
Are you fine with us
just being friends?

16:19.152 --> 16:20.936
Yes.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.741
If you're not ready to talk
to your mother,

16:23.765 --> 16:25.375
you should at least talk
to this father.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.989
He was in the dark
just like you.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.513
I'm fine
with just being friends.

16:32.556 --> 16:34.384
I completely believe you.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.695
And now you're just lying
to prove we all lie.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.914
That is a distinct possibility.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.932
Sarah.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.934
I told Katie you never knew
I was pregnant,

17:02.978 --> 17:04.893
and she said she hates me.

17:04.935 --> 17:07.678
She's a teenager.

17:07.722 --> 17:09.332
She's chock full
of pregnancy hormones.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.553
She doesn't hate you.
She should.

17:12.596 --> 17:15.382
I kept her from the father
who would have loved her.

17:17.471 --> 17:20.387
You didn't tell me
because you were afraid

17:20.430 --> 17:22.780
I wouldn't stay for her.
I didn't tell you

17:22.824 --> 17:24.130
because I was afraid

17:24.173 --> 17:26.175
you would only stay for her.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.266
I couldn't not love you, Nick.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.095
I still can't.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.722
I had another moment today.

18:34.765 --> 18:37.028
You threw up?

18:37.072 --> 18:39.161
Loud noise. Spooked.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.600
Keep seeing him,

18:43.644 --> 18:45.733
and I've called half the guys
I served with,

18:45.776 --> 18:48.344
but nobody remembers a Rashad.

18:50.912 --> 18:52.957
Well, maybe I'm just going nuts.

18:55.569 --> 18:59.355
Crazy people
don't think they're crazy.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.792
We'll figure this out.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.624
How is this fair?

19:07.668 --> 19:12.542
With me all beat up,
you have not aged a day.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.266
You want me to make you
feel young again?

19:17.808 --> 19:19.810
Go away!

19:19.854 --> 19:23.249
It's Katie.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.641
She can't see me here.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.009
I wasn't expecting to see you.

19:45.053 --> 19:48.056
I wasn't expecting to be here.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.144
You want to come in?

20:10.557 --> 20:15.866
Um, I don't really know
what I'm supposed to say.

20:15.910 --> 20:19.130
Yeah, I've been trying
to figure that out for months.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.698
Any luck?

20:21.742 --> 20:24.048
Long time no see?

20:24.092 --> 20:25.504
That's the best
you could come up with?

20:25.528 --> 20:28.227
Well, my talents
kinda lie elsewhere.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.451
I don't know anything about you.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.238
Fire away. I' an open book.

20:42.545 --> 20:44.808
How long did you
and my mom date?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.769
About a year.

20:48.812 --> 20:49.944
Did you love her?

20:51.293 --> 20:54.905
- Yeah.
- Why'd you break up with her?

20:54.949 --> 20:58.518
That's a tough one.

21:01.172 --> 21:02.652
Felt I had a duty.

21:08.876 --> 21:12.619
Wouldwould you have
wanted to know me

21:12.662 --> 21:14.882
all these years,
if you could have?

21:15.926 --> 21:17.101
Yeah, of course.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.109
Sorry my mom cheated us.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.722
Katie, I haven't been back long,

21:28.765 --> 21:30.177
but it's pretty clear
your mom's whole world

21:30.201 --> 21:31.377
revolves around you.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.292
Is there anything else
I should know?

21:36.817 --> 21:38.297
Yes.

21:39.559 --> 21:42.431
I make a mean teriyaki salmon.

21:42.475 --> 21:45.956
- You cook?
- Yeah, only teriyaki salmon.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.872
I dated a pescatarian
Japanese chef once.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.965
What do you say we hit
the grocery store

21:55.009 --> 21:56.315
and I make dinner?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.622
Okay.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.841
Okay.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.542
Look.

22:06.586 --> 22:08.186
I found some pictures
I want to show you.

22:12.287 --> 22:15.638
This was in Paris.
We took a cooking class.

22:15.682 --> 22:18.119
Let me tell you, it was sublime.

22:18.162 --> 22:20.077
I found some books
in the bathroom.

22:20.121 --> 22:21.905
Books about cancer.

22:23.690 --> 22:24.908
Is Ron sick?

22:25.431 --> 22:27.346
No, honey. I am.

22:33.830 --> 22:36.050
Look at me.

22:36.093 --> 22:37.834
I'm gonna be fine.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.664
And as long as we're
sharing secrets,

22:41.708 --> 22:44.493
I'd like you to tell me
the real reason

22:44.537 --> 22:46.713
that your father is upset.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.590
I'm in love with a girl.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.946
How long have you known her?

23:02.990 --> 23:04.557
A few months.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.647
She started up
at the restaurant I work at.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.997
It just sort of happened.

23:11.651 --> 23:15.089
Sometimes love sneaks up on you.

23:18.571 --> 23:23.010
Um, Patricia,
can I speak with you?

23:24.707 --> 23:26.100
Here.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.432
He didn't kick her out
because of us, Ron.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.023
Patricia...

23:36.066 --> 23:38.088
He kicked her out because
he's a sanctimonious bigot

23:38.112 --> 23:40.810
who can't handle the fact
that his daughter likes a girl.

23:40.854 --> 23:44.118
She's not dating a girl.
She's dating a woman,

23:44.161 --> 23:46.512
ten years older,

23:46.555 --> 23:49.297
and he didn't kick her out
because she's gay.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.821
She left angry
because they don't approve

23:51.865 --> 23:55.085
of her coming home drunk,
smelling of pot.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.304
What?

23:56.347 --> 23:59.394
And apparently
she stole money off of them.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.744
So you're taking their side?

24:03.006 --> 24:04.704
We're not taking
anyone's side, honey.

24:04.747 --> 24:07.620
We just wanna know the truth
so that we can help.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.622
Ron's ten years older than you.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.668
My father didn't approve
of that, either.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.278
- Olivia...
- Forget it.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.280
I can stay somewhere else.

24:51.838 --> 24:52.926
Dana?

24:54.536 --> 24:56.059
- Ben?
- Hey.

24:56.103 --> 24:59.976
I was just dropping a friend
off a few streets down.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.457
In uniform?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.285
Good deed for the day.

25:04.328 --> 25:05.808
What a coincidence.

25:07.767 --> 25:08.855
Yeah.

25:08.898 --> 25:10.813
Thought I'd drive by,
you know, and...

25:12.119 --> 25:13.860
Look, I could keep driving.
No, no, no.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.776
Itlt's good to see you.
It's just...

25:18.168 --> 25:19.256
Here you are.

25:20.606 --> 25:23.304
- Same as it ever was.
- A little different.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.438
I guess so.

25:32.792 --> 25:35.621
II wasl was going for coffee.

25:35.664 --> 25:38.667
Do you feel like walking?

25:38.711 --> 25:41.452
Yeah. Okay.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.324
Don't worry.

25:43.367 --> 25:44.847
The neighbors are mostly new.

25:44.891 --> 25:48.459
They'll think I found myself
a handsome stranger.

25:48.503 --> 25:50.331
No idea he's my husband.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.385
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.475
Is it still the worst coffee
in the city?

26:04.519 --> 26:06.739
Yeah, but it's hot
and it's close.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.350
Well, hot's an improvement.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.963
Unless it's too hot. Still good.

26:14.007 --> 26:15.748
Why did we ever
come here every day?

26:15.791 --> 26:18.228
Because you're a sucker
for a punch card.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.405
And the baby liked donuts.

26:21.449 --> 26:23.233
Yeah, he did.

26:29.500 --> 26:30.632
I forgot about that.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.591
It'sit'sit's cool.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.376
It's okay.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.291
Old habits.

26:37.334 --> 26:38.509
I got a lot of them.

26:46.387 --> 26:47.954
Are you happy?

26:50.565 --> 26:52.436
Sometimes.

26:52.480 --> 26:53.524
More lately.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.309
Yeah?

26:55.352 --> 26:56.440
Why is that?

26:59.574 --> 27:01.532
Making an effort, I guess.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.145
Two years.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.582
Everything on the street
still reminds me of him.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.933
I like that about it, though.

27:12.805 --> 27:14.125
He's gonna be on my mind anyway.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.069
It's nice to be reminded
of the good.

27:17.723 --> 27:20.639
The days at the park,
fall leaves...

27:22.292 --> 27:25.556
And he picked up every stick
he ever walked by.

27:25.600 --> 27:27.080
Yeah, he did.

27:35.175 --> 27:37.220
Are you here to say good-bye,
Ben?

27:40.833 --> 27:42.530
Just driving by.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.056
I'm glad you did.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.709
You know why your father
didn't approve

28:30.752 --> 28:33.059
of me and Patricia?

28:33.102 --> 28:35.670
My grandmother
was in an accident.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.890
You pulled the plug.

28:37.933 --> 28:41.110
Nine months on life support.

28:42.721 --> 28:46.550
The doctor said
her brain was gone.

28:48.727 --> 28:52.513
The pastor said,
"Leave it up to God."

28:54.341 --> 28:56.560
You know, when you're
struggling with something

28:56.604 --> 28:59.738
like that,
sometimes the hospital

28:59.781 --> 29:02.001
offers a social worker.

29:03.829 --> 29:06.092
Mine was named Patricia.

29:14.230 --> 29:17.625
I don't want your father
to lose you

29:17.668 --> 29:19.409
like I lost him.

29:20.671 --> 29:24.153
You think we could try talking?

29:28.244 --> 29:31.813
And if that doesn't work,
you know you always have

29:31.857 --> 29:34.076
a place here with us.

29:53.661 --> 29:54.923
Hello?

29:54.967 --> 29:57.056
It's Claire Danville.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.622
I was hoping we could chat.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.238
Um, yes, sure.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.697
Is everything all right?

30:29.740 --> 30:32.047
Just a little maintenance delay.

30:32.091 --> 30:34.223
All right with you.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.530
You seem a little distracted.

30:40.664 --> 30:43.711
If we can't talk candidly,
this won't be much of a date.

30:43.754 --> 30:46.279
I'm thinking about my Rosemary.

30:47.410 --> 30:50.370
Your wife.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.241
I feel a little guilty.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.679
Me, too.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.507
My Leon. He...

30:57.551 --> 31:00.162
He was the sweetest man
who ever lived.

31:03.078 --> 31:06.429
Why don't you tell me
what you loved about her?

31:08.127 --> 31:09.389
It would take all night.

31:09.432 --> 31:10.912
Well, from the looks of things,

31:10.956 --> 31:14.046
we're not going anywhere.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.917
We met at Coney Island.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.267
Coney Island.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.921
I love that.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.883
This is a great apartment.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.885
How long have you been here?

31:26.928 --> 31:29.017
Since Katie was little.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.063
It's only the second home
I've ever had.

31:31.106 --> 31:34.675
I love what you've done with it.

31:34.718 --> 31:36.546
It's small.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.852
Too much stuff.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.854
Well, I know people
who are as empty

31:39.898 --> 31:41.638
as their big apartments.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.642
It's what's inside that counts.

31:51.518 --> 31:54.825
This isn't easy, is it?

31:54.869 --> 31:57.219
Katie's handling it
remarkably well.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.568
For you.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.484
It's her baby.

32:01.528 --> 32:03.486
And your grandchild.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.583
Do you drink wine?

32:18.153 --> 32:20.329
A good sushi chef
will tell you the rice

32:20.373 --> 32:21.765
is more important than the fish.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.767
I'm not allowed to have sushi.

32:23.811 --> 32:26.031
Yours will be well done.

32:26.074 --> 32:27.554
So, where were we?

32:27.597 --> 32:31.471
- Favorite movie.
- "Last of the Mohicans".

32:31.514 --> 32:33.125
Tell me you've seen it.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.301
I've seen everything.
Movie rentals were cheap.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.042
It's amazing, right? I mean,

32:37.085 --> 32:38.715
when he has to leave her
behind the waterfall.

32:38.739 --> 32:40.654
- "I will find you!"
- Yeah.

32:40.697 --> 32:43.004
And then Alice throws herself
off the cliff,

32:43.048 --> 32:45.572
and you're just like, "No!"

32:45.615 --> 32:48.662
Devastating.

32:48.705 --> 32:51.143
You thought I would pick
a war movie, didn't you?

32:51.186 --> 32:52.753
It is a war movie.

32:52.796 --> 32:55.625
Stereotype me. Put me in a box.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.845
I am a hopeless romantic.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.282
Me, too.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.023
- So what's yours?
- "Harold and Maude".

33:03.633 --> 33:06.332
It's about a suicidal teen boy
who falls in love

33:06.375 --> 33:07.942
with an old lady.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.291
Does anybody skin a squirrel?

33:09.335 --> 33:10.162
No.

33:10.205 --> 33:11.728
Then I'm pretty much out.

33:11.772 --> 33:15.515
- You have a Band-Aid?
- Yeah, bathroom cabinet.

33:15.558 --> 33:16.995
I got this.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.100
You want something to drink?

33:46.067 --> 33:47.503
Jedi, dinner!

33:50.985 --> 33:52.639
Hey.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.032
Katie?

34:41.034 --> 34:43.081
Katie?

34:43.123 --> 34:44.777
You're home.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.562
Not for long.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.911
What's going on?
Please talk to me.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.043
He doesn't care.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.089
Who?

34:51.132 --> 34:52.438
Dad.

34:52.481 --> 34:53.960
What are you talking about?

34:54.004 --> 34:56.137
I was ten in that photo.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.203
Where did this come from?

34:59.227 --> 35:01.316
His things.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.144
No, II don't understand.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.928
He didn't just find out
about us.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.408
He's known for years.

35:06.452 --> 35:09.237
He saw me in that picture
and he didn't come back.

35:12.936 --> 35:15.069
You were right.

35:15.113 --> 35:17.680
He didn't want either of us.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.860
Hi, Katie.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.820
What's she doing here?

35:26.863 --> 35:31.216
I stopped by to talk
to your mom about the baby.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.479
You might want to think twice.

35:33.522 --> 35:36.134
It's genetically predisposed
to be a liar.

35:38.614 --> 35:39.920
Katie.

35:39.963 --> 35:40.921
Katie.

35:40.964 --> 35:42.183
Katie!

35:45.404 --> 35:46.666
Katie, honey, it's Patricia.

35:46.709 --> 35:47.928
Give me a call

35:47.971 --> 35:50.235
when you get this message, okay?

35:51.888 --> 35:53.063
Straight to voicemail.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.345
I was hoping
she'd pick up for you.

35:54.369 --> 35:58.199
And she just left for no reason?

35:58.243 --> 35:59.722
I don't know what I did.

36:02.290 --> 36:03.683
It's what you didn't do.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.212
What is this?

36:14.084 --> 36:16.696
Somebody sent it to me.

36:16.739 --> 36:17.871
Somebody?

36:20.743 --> 36:22.005
When?

36:22.049 --> 36:23.137
Years ago.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.622
And you didn't come back?

36:32.494 --> 36:34.888
Answer me.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.672
You didn't tell me.

36:36.716 --> 36:38.108
I figured either she wasn't mine

36:38.152 --> 36:40.152
or you didn't want me to know.
It's not about me.

36:43.853 --> 36:49.250
How could you see
this little girl with no father

36:49.294 --> 36:51.078
and not want to meet her?

36:53.428 --> 36:56.083
I was in a different world.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.783
You don't deserve her.

37:04.787 --> 37:05.832
Nick?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.662
What have you done?

37:25.199 --> 37:26.287
Hey.

37:26.331 --> 37:28.246
Is this a drive-by?

37:28.289 --> 37:30.117
I'd be driving.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.640
Right.

37:37.342 --> 37:39.909
Well, I didn't see that coming.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.434
Yeah, you and me both.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.088
For the record,
I didn't ask oror need you

37:45.132 --> 37:46.351
to turn my deposition

37:46.394 --> 37:48.962
into some grand soapbox
heroic moment.

37:49.005 --> 37:50.093
Can we not do this?

37:50.137 --> 37:51.530
But it was.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.967
It was what?

37:54.010 --> 37:55.055
A hero moment.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.714
For what it's worth, he's wrong.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.412
You're smart and you're driven,
and employers will see that,

38:04.456 --> 38:07.720
and you'll get your fast cars
and fancy ski vacations yet.

38:10.679 --> 38:14.944
He told me people
become lawyers to get justice

38:14.988 --> 38:17.425
or to get paid.

38:17.469 --> 38:19.688
I did it so my dad would see me.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.086
I see you.

38:37.402 --> 38:39.099
I wanted to do that
for a long time.

38:39.142 --> 38:41.362
I did it. Don't take credit.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.931
Can I take credit for this one?

38:52.591 --> 38:57.378
45 minutes.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.033
You're cute when you're angry.

39:00.076 --> 39:04.037
- We missed our reservation.
- I had a late lunch.

39:04.080 --> 39:07.214
Yeah, but I promised you
a night you would never forget.

39:07.257 --> 39:09.477
I'd say this
is pretty memorable.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.141
How much for whatever you got?

39:53.347 --> 39:55.828
Excuse me.

41:56.731 --> 41:59.038
Hey, Nicky.

42:01.257 --> 42:02.694
I think you should leave.
