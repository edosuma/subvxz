Ho-ho!
What's the rush, man?

00:08.724 --> 00:10.125
I almost forgot.

00:10.126 --> 00:12.077
It's 6:00, and today's my
15th wedding anniversary.

00:12.078 --> 00:14.112
Ah, you're going out
and buy Vera a present

00:14.113 --> 00:15.373
before the stores close?

00:15.381 --> 00:17.448
(horn beeping)

00:17.516 --> 00:18.917
Happy anniversary, honey.

00:20.653 --> 00:23.254

Okay, fellas,
let's call it a night.

01:14.190 --> 01:16.224
Boy, that's the longest day
of my life.

01:16.292 --> 01:17.792
Yeah? Why so
tired, Sammy?

01:17.793 --> 01:19.577
Oh, I didn't get a wink
of sleep last night.

01:19.578 --> 01:21.963
Ooh!
Ooh!

01:21.964 --> 01:23.848
Oh, no, no, give me
a break, will you?

01:23.849 --> 01:26.384
Not everything I do in my
life has to do with sex.

01:26.451 --> 01:27.502
Sure it does, Sammy.

01:27.503 --> 01:28.836
Come on, give us the details.

01:28.837 --> 01:29.871
Yeah, come on.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.589
Yeah, well, I had silverfish

01:31.657 --> 01:33.691
all over my apartment
last night.

01:33.759 --> 01:35.009
Ewww!

01:35.077 --> 01:36.645
Silverfish!

01:36.712 --> 01:40.464
Spent the whole night rolling
up newspapers and swatting them.

01:40.532 --> 01:42.750
Oh, kinky.

01:42.818 --> 01:44.152
SAM:
It got so bad

01:44.220 --> 01:45.453
there for a while, I...

01:45.520 --> 01:47.989
I started rubbing ammonia
on the baseboard.

01:47.990 --> 01:50.258
(howls)
Sammy, don't know what that means,

01:50.259 --> 01:53.161
but does she have a sister?

01:53.228 --> 01:54.862
Hey, guys, I...
I'm serious, man.

01:54.863 --> 01:56.631
I've got some...
I've got a real problem

01:56.632 --> 01:57.749
with insects in my place.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.620
As a matter of fact, uh,
they're, uh,

01:59.621 --> 02:01.502
tenting the whole building,
you know,

02:01.503 --> 02:04.238
and fumigating it
for, like, 24 hours.

02:04.239 --> 02:05.973
Ouch!
Where are you gonna sleep?

02:05.974 --> 02:07.309
I happen to be
spending the night

02:07.310 --> 02:08.776
with a very close friend
of mine.

02:08.776 --> 02:11.067
(grunting salaciously)
Close friend! Hey!

02:11.068 --> 02:12.980
Sam, you don't have to spend the
night with one of your bimbos.

02:12.981 --> 02:14.081
You can come over to my house.

02:14.082 --> 02:15.517
I have a fold-out couch.

02:15.584 --> 02:17.335
(Norm howls, Cliff snickers)

02:17.403 --> 02:19.971
As nice as that
offer sounds, uh,

02:20.039 --> 02:22.073
the alternative
is to spend the night

02:22.074 --> 02:23.775
with a stewardess who's offered

02:23.776 --> 02:25.376
to bump me up to first class.

02:25.444 --> 02:27.645
CLIFF AND NORM:
Ooh...

02:27.713 --> 02:30.031
Oh, yeah, hey,
I had a stew once.

02:30.099 --> 02:31.549
Yeah, used to go out with her.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.035
Boy, was she wild in the sack.

02:34.103 --> 02:35.269
What airline?

02:35.337 --> 02:37.238
Shut up.

02:37.239 --> 02:40.174
Well, Sam, if you
change your mind,

02:40.175 --> 02:41.576
you do have a place to stay.

02:41.644 --> 02:43.978
Yeah, well, you know,
with all due respect,

02:44.046 --> 02:46.036
we're not talking
about your love life.

02:46.037 --> 02:47.682
We're talking about
my love life.

02:47.683 --> 02:49.968
It will work out for Sammy.

02:50.035 --> 02:54.439
If your ego needs a place
to stay, give me a call.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.857
CLIFF:
Of course it'll work out.

02:55.858 --> 02:56.991
It's a stew, isn't it?

02:57.059 --> 02:58.559
Boy, don't I know.

02:58.627 --> 02:59.677
How do you know?

02:59.728 --> 03:01.796
Shut up!

03:03.199 --> 03:06.034
Hey, Wood, come on,
I'll walk you to your car.

03:06.035 --> 03:07.118
Good night, Sam.

03:07.119 --> 03:08.486
Good night, Woody.

03:08.553 --> 03:10.788
Oh, hey, uh, listen, Sam.

03:10.789 --> 03:12.540
You know, don't worry
about that

03:12.541 --> 03:13.458
bug killer stuff.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.660
They say to stay out
for 24 hours,

03:15.728 --> 03:17.695
but that's just overcautious.

03:17.696 --> 03:19.163
They sprayed my building once.

03:19.164 --> 03:20.214
I went right back in.

03:20.232 --> 03:21.282
Come on.

03:23.052 --> 03:24.519
Okay, let's go.

03:24.587 --> 03:26.954
Oh, by the way, Sam,
uh, listen,

03:27.022 --> 03:28.590
uh, I was meaning to tell you.

03:28.591 --> 03:30.291
Don't worry
about that bug killer stuff.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.162
They tell you to stay out
for 24 hours.

03:32.194 --> 03:33.514
That's just overcautious.

03:33.515 --> 03:34.896
They sprayed my building once.

03:34.897 --> 03:35.963
I went right back in.

03:36.031 --> 03:37.515
You ready, Carla?

03:38.451 --> 03:39.967
Okay, guys, come on, let's go.

03:39.968 --> 03:41.036
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

03:41.037 --> 03:42.170
All right, good night.

03:42.171 --> 03:45.206
Hey, good luck with
that stewardess, huh?

03:45.274 --> 03:48.443
Swat a few silverfish for me.

03:48.511 --> 03:50.501
Cliffie, you just
don't get it, do you?

03:50.513 --> 03:52.647
No.

03:53.466 --> 03:56.484
(humming)

04:08.997 --> 04:10.764
(spritzing)

04:14.236 --> 04:16.221
(knocking)

04:16.288 --> 04:17.370
Ooh, yes!

04:17.439 --> 04:21.125
(singing happily)

04:21.192 --> 04:22.994
Hold on.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.112
There we are.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.496
Hi, Sam.

04:25.564 --> 04:28.867
(laughing):
Look at you- you wore your uniform.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.235
Hey, what do you say
we, uh, lock ourselves

04:31.236 --> 04:33.805
in the bathroom there and
relive our first meeting?

04:33.806 --> 04:35.073
Oh... I'd love to, Sam,

04:35.141 --> 04:36.831
but I just stopped by
to tell you,

04:36.842 --> 04:38.977
I gotta be on a plane
in 45 minutes.

04:38.978 --> 04:39.844
No!

04:39.845 --> 04:42.464
Aw... well, heck.

04:42.531 --> 04:44.365
Well, 45 minutes-
that gives us

04:44.433 --> 04:46.167
plenty of time to relive it.

04:46.168 --> 04:47.118
What say, huh?

04:47.119 --> 04:48.486
No, no, no, I've got to go.

04:48.554 --> 04:49.620
The airport's a zoo.

04:49.688 --> 04:52.323
50,000 Shriners are coming in
for a convention.

04:52.391 --> 04:55.376
Why... why don't they stay
in their own country, huh?

04:57.646 --> 04:58.713
(rattling)

04:58.781 --> 05:00.181
Oh...
Oh, yeah, sorry.

05:00.248 --> 05:01.949
You've just gotta...

05:02.017 --> 05:03.084
There you go.

05:03.152 --> 05:04.419
Good night.
Thanks.

05:04.486 --> 05:05.653
See you when I get back.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.121
Yeah, you bet, you bet.

05:07.189 --> 05:08.906
Shoot, shoot.

05:08.974 --> 05:10.591
Well...

05:10.659 --> 05:12.026
Oh, oh, oh, wait a minute.

05:12.027 --> 05:13.127
Wait, wait... oh!

05:13.128 --> 05:14.629
Say, Julie?

05:14.696 --> 05:15.929
Julie?

05:15.930 --> 05:18.032
Hey, honey, listen,
I need a place to stay.

05:18.033 --> 05:19.284
Julie!

05:19.351 --> 05:20.401
(latch clicks)

05:21.720 --> 05:24.071
(rattling latch)

05:29.611 --> 05:31.312
Oh, no.

05:34.116 --> 05:39.520
SHRINER: Believe me, honey,
you were wise to stay home.

05:39.521 --> 05:42.289
This town is nothing
compared to Cincinnati.

05:42.358 --> 05:47.662
Yeah, I just, uh, stayed in
my hotel room, watched CNN.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.497
I don't watch movies like that.

05:49.565 --> 05:50.998
You know that.

05:51.066 --> 05:53.334
Hey, excuse me,
I gotta use the phone.

05:53.335 --> 05:54.852
I locked myself out of my bar,

05:54.853 --> 05:56.721
and I gotta call my waitress
to get the keys,

05:56.722 --> 05:57.855
so could you hurry up, please?

05:57.856 --> 06:00.057
Hey, uh, look, I gotta run.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.677
Honey, you know
I wanted to bring you,

06:02.745 --> 06:05.379
but none of the guys
brought their wives.

06:05.447 --> 06:08.282
Don't start.
Don't start.

06:08.350 --> 06:10.685
You're starting again.
Don't start.

06:10.752 --> 06:12.986
Once she gets started...

06:15.558 --> 06:18.092
Yes. Yes, dear.

06:23.432 --> 06:28.102
(ringing doorbell insistently)
Carla! Carla!

06:32.608 --> 06:34.058
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry.

06:34.059 --> 06:36.394
You know, I didn't know
you were going to be here.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.695
And now you do.

06:37.763 --> 06:40.564
Uh... Wait a minute. Come back!
Hey, let me in, will you?

06:40.632 --> 06:42.550
I locked myself out of the bar.

06:42.551 --> 06:44.052
I need to borrow Carla's keys.

06:44.053 --> 06:45.453
Fine.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.021
Carla!

06:47.089 --> 06:49.323
Sam's here.

06:49.391 --> 06:50.809
Hey, you know what?

06:50.876 --> 06:54.112
I could borrow your keys
to Melville's.

06:54.180 --> 06:56.764
Yes, you could. Carla!

06:58.600 --> 07:00.534
Hey.
Hey.

07:00.602 --> 07:02.036
What's up, Sammy?

07:02.104 --> 07:04.906
Oh, well, I, uh...
My date didn't turn out,

07:04.907 --> 07:06.607
and I locked myself
out of the bar,

07:06.608 --> 07:08.238
and so I need to
borrow your keys.

07:08.243 --> 07:09.543
You have my set.

07:09.611 --> 07:11.145
No, I don't.
Yeah. Remember?

07:11.146 --> 07:12.963
Woody lost his,
so you gave him yours,

07:12.964 --> 07:14.865
and then you took mine,
and then he lost yours again.

07:14.866 --> 07:18.085
Oh, I do hope you haven't sold
the movie rights

07:18.153 --> 07:21.188
to this fascinating story.

07:21.256 --> 07:23.625
Hey, why don't you go over
to Rebecca's?

07:23.692 --> 07:25.159
I mean, she offered, right?

07:25.160 --> 07:26.744
No, no, no, no.
I said some stuff.

07:26.745 --> 07:28.979
I don't want her to
throw it back in my face.

07:29.047 --> 07:32.800
Well, I guess you could
stay here for the night.

07:32.867 --> 07:33.917
Yeah! Yeah!

07:33.919 --> 07:35.636
All right, thanks. Yeah.

07:35.704 --> 07:37.521
Look, Sammy...
What?

07:37.589 --> 07:39.590
No matter what you hear,

07:39.658 --> 07:42.393
no matter how much I scream
or call for help,

07:42.460 --> 07:44.979
do not open the bedroom
door- got it?

07:45.047 --> 07:47.665
Ditto for me, too, Sam.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.534
Oh, no, no, no, uh, listen...

07:49.601 --> 07:51.335
maybe, uh...
I-I tell you what.

07:51.403 --> 07:53.203
I know a guy who's
got a hotel near...

07:53.271 --> 07:54.705
Fabulous idea!

07:57.776 --> 07:59.209
Good night, Sam.

08:06.484 --> 08:08.235
No. We have no rooms.

08:08.303 --> 08:10.571
Every hotel is full.

08:10.638 --> 08:13.374
There's a Shriners' convention
in town.

08:13.442 --> 08:15.776
Stop bothering me!

08:15.844 --> 08:18.346
If I have to deal with
one more idiot tonight,

08:18.347 --> 08:19.681
I'm going to strangle him.

08:19.682 --> 08:22.483
How may I help you, sir?

08:22.551 --> 08:25.052
Hi.
Steve working tonight?

08:25.120 --> 08:26.687
Steve? No.

08:26.688 --> 08:28.889
Steve hasn't worked here
for the last six months.

08:28.890 --> 08:31.659
He was unreliable.

08:31.660 --> 08:33.628
Is there anything
I can help you with?

08:33.629 --> 08:35.513
Yeah. Uh...

08:35.581 --> 08:38.633
This is, uh... this
is pretty funny, Mario.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.750
You're going to get
a big kick out of this.

08:40.769 --> 08:43.638
Uh... See, I... I left
my, uh... left my wallet

08:43.705 --> 08:45.640
in my place of
business and I, uh...

08:45.707 --> 08:48.209
I don't have a credit
card or money or,

08:48.277 --> 08:51.078
for that matter, any
identification at all.

08:51.079 --> 08:52.196
(wry laugh):
Yuh-huh.

08:52.197 --> 08:55.500
That's funny stuff, sir.

08:57.736 --> 09:00.505
The point is, uh...
I'm gonna need a room,

09:00.572 --> 09:02.806
and I... I can't
pay for it tonight.

09:02.874 --> 09:05.426
Oh, I see- you want
one of our free rooms.

09:05.427 --> 09:06.544
No, no, it doesn't
have to be free.

09:06.545 --> 09:08.646
I can, you know,
I can pay for it in the morning.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.364
Well, whatever's
convenient for you.

09:10.365 --> 09:13.267
Now, would you like
a suite or a room?

09:13.335 --> 09:15.002
A suite would be great.

09:15.070 --> 09:16.837
All right.
Colour TV? Sauna?

09:16.905 --> 09:19.323
Well, sure.

09:19.391 --> 09:22.243
Is that going to be a queen
or a king-sized bed?

09:22.311 --> 09:24.178
Uh... king.
Yeah, please.

09:24.179 --> 09:26.046
And, Mario, non-smoking,
if you don't mind.

09:26.047 --> 09:27.515
But of course.

09:27.583 --> 09:30.473
And would you like me to carry
you to your room piggyback?

09:32.153 --> 09:33.588
Oh, I see.

09:33.589 --> 09:36.023
You're, uh... you're being
sarcastic, aren't you?

09:36.024 --> 09:37.041
If you had spent the day

09:37.042 --> 09:39.427
fending off joy buzzers
and squirting carnations,

09:39.428 --> 09:41.796
you'd be
a mite cranky yourself.

09:41.864 --> 09:44.632
So you're, uh...
you're not going to give me a room, huh?

09:44.700 --> 09:46.100
I don't have a room to give.

09:46.101 --> 09:47.435
Nobody in Boston has a room.

09:47.436 --> 09:49.870
The entire town
is infested with Shriners!

09:49.938 --> 09:52.290
Now, if you're desperate
for a place to sleep,

09:52.357 --> 09:54.558
might I suggest
you become a Shriner?

09:54.626 --> 09:57.228
I'm not entirely sure
how one goes about that,

09:57.229 --> 09:58.595
but it appears to
have something to do

09:58.596 --> 10:02.400
with driving a tiny car
through the lobby of my hotel.

10:02.467 --> 10:05.286
Can I use your phone, please?

10:05.353 --> 10:06.888
Oh, but of course.

10:06.955 --> 10:08.739
Would you like
to call Australia?

10:08.807 --> 10:12.142
Perhaps one of our new picture
phones will suit your needs.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.428
Never mind.
Never mind.

10:14.496 --> 10:15.596
Enjoyed your stay?

10:15.664 --> 10:17.665
Why not tell a friend?

10:20.268 --> 10:23.337
NORM:
No problem, Sam. Mi casa es su casa.

10:23.338 --> 10:24.655
Oh, bless your heart, man.

10:24.656 --> 10:26.624
I think I'll just
stretch out on the couch here.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.792
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm gonna sleep on the couch tonight.

10:28.793 --> 10:31.061
You're sleeping
on the couch? Yeah.

10:31.062 --> 10:32.763
Yeah. Sometimes, when
I come home late from Cheers,

10:32.764 --> 10:34.098
I don't like to wake Vera up,

10:34.099 --> 10:35.909
so I just crash
out on the couch here.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.168
But you're always late
at Cheers.

10:38.236 --> 10:40.020
Yeah. How about that?

10:40.088 --> 10:41.888
Oh, please?

10:41.956 --> 10:43.124
Oh, now, now, now, now...

10:43.192 --> 10:44.525
Please.
Okay. All right.

10:44.592 --> 10:46.828
Aw, bless you.
If you're that desperate,

10:46.895 --> 10:49.663
I'll show you
what a good friend I am.

10:49.731 --> 10:51.465
Go ahead and sleep on the couch.

10:51.533 --> 10:54.202
I'll go sleep with my wife.

10:54.269 --> 10:56.437
Thank you.
Thank you.

10:58.673 --> 10:59.941
(sighs)

11:00.008 --> 11:01.375
Well, here I go.

11:02.728 --> 11:06.864
You're going to let me do this,
aren't you?

11:06.865 --> 11:09.166
I'm so tired.

11:09.234 --> 11:13.053
All right.
You owe me big time, Malone.

11:13.121 --> 11:16.073
VERA:
Norm? Norm, is that you?

11:16.141 --> 11:17.674
NORM:
Yes, dear.

11:17.742 --> 11:19.676
VERA:
You've come home to me.

11:19.744 --> 11:22.213
Come here, lover boy.

11:36.745 --> 11:40.498
Okay, Sam, there're some
extra towels by the sink

11:40.565 --> 11:41.798
in the guest bathroom.

11:41.799 --> 11:42.866
Oh, God!

11:42.867 --> 11:44.201
If there's anything else
you need,

11:44.202 --> 11:45.236
just let me know.

11:45.237 --> 11:46.604
Don't worry
about disturbing Lilith.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.406
(chuckles)
She's, uh, sleeping in the cellar.

11:49.474 --> 11:50.791
In the cellar?

11:50.859 --> 11:54.095
Yes- you can take the girl
out of the Eco pod, you know...

11:54.162 --> 11:55.396
(laughs)

11:55.463 --> 11:57.231
Ah, thank you.

11:57.298 --> 11:59.600
You bet.
Uh, listen, that's it.

11:59.668 --> 12:02.386
I'll just bid you
a fond Bonne nuit.

12:02.454 --> 12:04.639
(child cries in distance)

12:04.706 --> 12:06.473
Say, uh, wha...

12:06.542 --> 12:09.276
Is that, uh, is that Frederick?

12:09.344 --> 12:11.011
Yes, that's Frederick.

12:11.012 --> 12:12.580
Having a bit of a tantrum
tonight.

12:12.581 --> 12:14.114
Trying to manipulate me,
you see.

12:14.115 --> 12:16.149
It's a common tactic
of a four-year-old,

12:16.150 --> 12:19.086
and as any good parent knows,
the secret is to just ignore it.

12:19.087 --> 12:20.487
He's just gonna have

12:20.555 --> 12:23.223
to cry himself out,
the little weasel. (chuckles)

12:23.291 --> 12:26.159
He's got, uh,
good lungs, though, huh?

12:26.227 --> 12:28.361
Well, night-night.

12:28.429 --> 12:30.659
(crying continues,
increasing in volume)

12:35.920 --> 12:37.087
(quietly):
Oh, God!

12:40.075 --> 12:43.210
Hey...

12:43.278 --> 12:44.879
Hey, Freddie!

12:44.947 --> 12:47.181
Can you hear me, Freddie?

12:47.248 --> 12:49.850
I-It's Sam Malone!
Uncle Sammy!

12:49.918 --> 12:52.519
Say, uh, Freddie,

12:52.588 --> 12:56.557
you're kind of a big boy to be
throwing a tantrum, aren't you?

12:56.625 --> 12:58.993
Do you think you could hold off

12:59.061 --> 13:00.461
until tomorrow morning?

13:00.528 --> 13:03.214
(crying stops)

13:03.281 --> 13:06.083
Thank you.

13:06.151 --> 13:09.603
Oh! Oh, thank you, God.

13:11.075 --> 13:13.157
(weary sigh)

13:13.158 --> 13:15.226
(Frederick wailing) Oh...

13:25.586 --> 13:27.804
I'm so tired.

13:27.872 --> 13:28.939
I'm desperate.

13:29.007 --> 13:31.775
God forgive me for this.

13:33.845 --> 13:35.246
Sam!

13:35.313 --> 13:37.981
Clifford, look, it's one
of your little friends!

13:48.543 --> 13:51.712
(wearily): I'm so sorry to
come so late like this, Cliff.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.950
It's just that I'm
so very, very exhausted.

13:54.015 --> 13:55.182
Oh, thank you!

13:55.250 --> 13:57.718
You know, with the key
and everything?

13:57.786 --> 14:00.688
No apologies needed, young man.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.490
You poor thing.

14:02.557 --> 14:04.124
So cold and no muffler!

14:04.192 --> 14:06.460
You could have caught
your death.

14:06.528 --> 14:07.628
Oh!

14:07.629 --> 14:08.930
Yeah, you're always
welcome here, Sammy.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.765
You should know that, buddy.

14:10.832 --> 14:13.817
Oh, Cliffie, man,
you're the best.

14:13.885 --> 14:16.052
And you, too,
Mrs. Clavin.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.905
Oh, what a dear.

14:17.973 --> 14:20.841
Now, I'll bet you're anxious
to get some sleep.

14:20.909 --> 14:23.627
(giddily):
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

14:23.695 --> 14:25.529
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

14:25.596 --> 14:27.131
CLIFF:
Good.

14:27.199 --> 14:30.684
Well, that's a pretty comfy bed
there, isn't it, Sammy, huh?

14:40.178 --> 14:43.013
Am I sharing the same bed
with Cliff?

14:43.081 --> 14:44.982
Well, of course, silly.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.351
You didn't expect
to sleep with me!

14:47.419 --> 14:48.536
(laughs)

14:48.603 --> 14:50.671
No, no, this is...
this'll be all right.

14:50.672 --> 14:51.739
This is fine.

14:51.740 --> 14:53.841
All right, then,
nighty-night.

14:53.909 --> 14:55.208
Good night, Ma.

14:58.914 --> 15:03.017
Cliff, this is probably
one of those things

15:03.084 --> 15:06.253
that we should
just keep between the two of us, right?

15:06.321 --> 15:09.156
Gotcha, Sam.

15:09.224 --> 15:11.959
Oh, I almost forgot.

15:12.026 --> 15:15.779
Clifford, wake your
friend for prayers.

15:15.847 --> 15:18.482
Oh!
Sam, Sam, wake up.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.684
Huh?

15:23.371 --> 15:25.089
Oh, yeah.

15:26.658 --> 15:30.210
Dear Lord,
bless Clifford and me,

15:30.278 --> 15:32.179
unworthy wretches that we are.

15:32.247 --> 15:35.783
Bless the postal system
and keep it from harm,

15:35.851 --> 15:40.655
by helping it to detect
the real loonies.

15:40.722 --> 15:43.090
Bless our friends,
and thank you

15:43.158 --> 15:46.693
for letting Sam find
succour here tonight.

15:46.761 --> 15:49.129
Bless the late
Mr. Clavin.

15:49.197 --> 15:51.064
I know he's not
in your vicinity,

15:51.132 --> 15:55.435
but rather roasting
in hell, on a spit...

15:55.503 --> 15:58.538
on a spit reserved for those
who desert their families.

15:58.606 --> 16:00.174
Amen.
Amen.

16:00.241 --> 16:02.459
MRS. CLAVIN:
Sam? Hmm?

16:02.527 --> 16:03.727
Is there anyone special

16:03.795 --> 16:06.130
you would like the
Lord to remember?

16:06.197 --> 16:07.781
No, not particularly.

16:09.818 --> 16:12.720
Well, don't be surprised
if he doesn't remember you.

16:12.787 --> 16:14.187
Oh, please, please.

16:14.255 --> 16:15.585
Can't we just go to sleep?

16:15.590 --> 16:17.424
I'm so very tired.
Please!

16:17.492 --> 16:20.060
Great, Ma,
you made my friend mad.

16:20.127 --> 16:22.146
Any wonder
I don't have anybody over?

16:22.213 --> 16:24.348
Any wonder I don't have
any friends?

16:24.416 --> 16:27.851
Oh, you don't have
friends because of me?

16:27.919 --> 16:33.857
Me... who spent 36 hours
of the most painful labour

16:33.925 --> 16:35.305
the hospital had ever seen?

16:36.644 --> 16:38.362
There she goes.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.600
If you think
you're better off without me,

16:40.601 --> 16:42.132
you're welcome
to live by yourself.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.700
Just see how long you can last.

16:43.768 --> 16:45.169
Fine!

16:45.236 --> 16:46.787
A day- I give it a day.

16:46.854 --> 16:48.604
And that's during
daylight hours.

16:48.623 --> 16:51.091
Night falls and it's,
"Where's my mommy?"

16:51.159 --> 16:53.043
CLIFF:
Oh!

16:53.111 --> 16:54.161
Oh, is that right?

16:54.212 --> 16:56.347
Well, let me tell you, missy,

16:56.414 --> 16:58.549
that it takes two
to be codependent!

16:58.617 --> 17:01.685
You're the enabler!
You're the enabler!

17:01.753 --> 17:03.887
Oh! I'm the enabler
am I tonight, huh?

17:03.955 --> 17:06.890
Like last night
and the night before?!

17:06.891 --> 17:08.474
Well, you know why
I'm the enabler?!

17:08.476 --> 17:11.611
Because you demand it!

17:11.679 --> 17:13.630
Everything I do is wrong!

17:13.698 --> 17:15.366
Is that it, Clifford?!

17:16.968 --> 17:21.104
Oh, Ma, I'm sorry.

17:21.172 --> 17:23.239
Oh, now, don't be upset.

17:23.307 --> 17:25.308
I just, I just push too hard.

17:25.376 --> 17:27.278
No, I'm too domineering.

17:27.295 --> 17:29.113
Oh, Ma, Ma, it's me.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.480
I, you know, Ma, it's me.

17:30.548 --> 17:31.982
Sam...

17:32.050 --> 17:34.084
Hmm?

17:34.152 --> 17:36.253
Sam, which one of us is worse?

17:39.207 --> 17:42.442
(weakly):
Can't we please go to sleep?

17:44.095 --> 17:47.331
I suppose that is a good idea.

17:47.398 --> 17:49.933
Good night, sweet precious.

17:50.001 --> 17:52.469
Goodnight, Ma.

17:52.536 --> 17:55.305
Don't forget the bathroom
and turn off the light.

17:55.373 --> 17:56.473
All right.

17:58.977 --> 18:05.415
Oh, my God!
Cliff, what a nasty scene!

18:05.483 --> 18:06.917
What was?

18:08.753 --> 18:10.720
Nothing. Nothing.

18:10.788 --> 18:12.089
Good night.

18:12.156 --> 18:14.057
Good night, Sam.

18:18.529 --> 18:21.164
(whispers):
Sammy?

18:21.232 --> 18:23.666
Sammy?!

18:23.734 --> 18:25.969
(wearily):
Yes, Cliff?

18:26.037 --> 18:27.804
You awake?

18:27.872 --> 18:30.507
Yes, Cliff.

18:30.574 --> 18:32.142
Hey...

18:32.210 --> 18:34.211
Sam...

18:34.279 --> 18:35.745
you know what's fun?

18:35.813 --> 18:38.382
What's fun, Cliff?

18:38.449 --> 18:41.985
Well, when you take the
letters of somebody's name

18:42.053 --> 18:44.621
and make another
word out of it.

18:45.923 --> 18:49.926
You know, like if
it were my name- Clifford Clavin.

18:49.994 --> 18:54.731
Well, first word that comes
to mind, I'd say: Ford.

18:54.799 --> 18:56.433
Well, there's also cliff.

18:56.501 --> 18:59.836
You know, like the geo...
geographical structure.

18:59.904 --> 19:03.941
There's almost clavicle.

19:12.016 --> 19:14.901
Livid.

19:14.969 --> 19:17.103
Cliffie, please.

19:17.171 --> 19:21.608
Oh, can't think of any?

19:21.676 --> 19:24.878
I'm trying
to sleep here, Cliff.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.513
Sure thing, Sam.
Good night.

19:31.419 --> 19:33.153
How 'bout florid?

19:33.221 --> 19:35.989
Cliff, damn it, man!
I'm tired!

19:35.990 --> 19:38.158
I'm really, really tired!
I'm trying to sleep here!

19:38.159 --> 19:39.993
Can't you just stop talking
for once?!

19:39.994 --> 19:42.596
Please, stop talking?!

19:49.337 --> 19:50.604
I'm sorry, Sammy.

19:50.672 --> 19:54.975
I was just, it's a problem
I have- I, uh...

19:57.912 --> 20:00.581
You know, I try to
stop talking and...

20:02.917 --> 20:05.619
and I just keep on talking.

20:05.620 --> 20:08.489
You know, it's kind
of like those people

20:08.490 --> 20:09.890
who live near Niagara Falls,

20:09.891 --> 20:13.126
and after a while they
just don't hear it anymore.

20:15.830 --> 20:20.534
I mean I read an
article about this couple...

20:20.535 --> 20:23.036
they've lived near the Falls
for about 40 years or so,

20:23.037 --> 20:27.240
and they moved away and
the, uh... silence was,

20:27.241 --> 20:28.341
you know, just deafening.

20:28.342 --> 20:29.643
They had to move back.

20:29.711 --> 20:31.412
Couldn't stand it.

20:31.479 --> 20:34.715
Why are some people like that

20:34.783 --> 20:39.586
and... and just other
people aren't, Sammy?

20:39.654 --> 20:41.588
You ever think about that?

20:42.256 --> 20:44.591
Sam?

20:45.527 --> 20:46.577
Sammy?

20:49.931 --> 20:51.732
Sam?!

20:51.800 --> 20:54.601
MRS. CLAVIN:
He's gone, isn't he, Clifford?

20:54.669 --> 20:57.604
It's all your fault, old woman!

21:06.831 --> 21:08.165
Rebecca?

21:09.868 --> 21:11.168
Rebecca?

21:13.154 --> 21:15.455
What?
Sam, what are you doing here?

21:15.523 --> 21:16.723
I thought you had a date.

21:16.791 --> 21:18.091
Well, yeah, I did.

21:18.092 --> 21:19.859
But, uh, things didn't work out
the way I expected,

21:19.860 --> 21:21.094
so I thought I'd, you know,

21:21.095 --> 21:22.696
swing by here and take you up
on your offer.

21:22.697 --> 21:24.798
Oh, old boring me?

21:24.866 --> 21:27.167
Oh, I don't know how good
that'd be, Sam.

21:27.168 --> 21:29.870
I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't
want to slow you down,

21:29.871 --> 21:31.604
in your great,
swinging love life.

21:31.605 --> 21:34.991
Please, you have no idea
what I've been through.

21:35.059 --> 21:37.961
(imitating his weak voice):
Yes, I do. Carla called.

21:38.028 --> 21:39.613
Ah...
And then Norm.

21:39.614 --> 21:41.748
I've been sitting here for
three hours eating popcorn,

21:41.749 --> 21:43.850
watching movies, waiting
for you to come by here.

21:43.851 --> 21:45.269
Can I stay here?

21:45.336 --> 21:46.670
Can I go to sleep, please?

21:46.671 --> 21:47.654
Yes.

21:47.655 --> 21:49.939
Oh! Thank you!

21:50.007 --> 21:51.057
Come on. Get up.

21:51.075 --> 21:53.009
Don't get crazy about this...

21:53.077 --> 21:55.011
Oh, no. Oh, God.

21:55.012 --> 21:56.079
No, no!

21:56.080 --> 21:57.981
No more "Oh, no's!"
No, not tonight.

21:57.982 --> 21:59.048
Please. What's wrong?

21:59.049 --> 22:00.116
It's locked.

22:00.184 --> 22:02.385
Well, so, call the super!

22:02.453 --> 22:05.239
Well, I am the super.

22:11.813 --> 22:17.884
How 'bout, uh, anvil?

22:17.952 --> 22:21.254
Anvil is a...
that's a good one.

22:21.322 --> 22:23.990
Oh, no.
We did that an hour ago.
