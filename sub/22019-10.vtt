WEBVTT

00:58.420 --> 01:00.718
JJ: WELL, I SAY
JUST OPEN YOUR MOUTH

01:00.760 --> 01:02.387
AND GET ON IN THERE.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.227
DON'T THINK
I HAVEN'T CONSIDERED IT.

01:04.260 --> 01:06.091
A LATE NIGHT?

01:06.130 --> 01:08.394
POKER. MY FRIENDS
WERE LOSING,

01:08.430 --> 01:10.421
SO I LET THE GAME GO ON,

01:10.470 --> 01:12.665
GIVE THEM A CHANCE
TO WIN THEIR MONEY BACK.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.861
MM-HMM. OR RIDE YOUR
HOT STREAK A LITTLE LONGER.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.300
JJ: SO, UH, WHO WAS
THERE LAST NIGHT?

01:17.340 --> 01:19.171
OOH, CAN I GUESS?

01:19.210 --> 01:21.633
UM...RINGO.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.840
OF COURSE.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.440
ONE OF YOUR 3-STAR
GENERAL BUDDIES,

01:25.480 --> 01:28.847
AND I SAW JUDGE JUDY
WAS IN TOWN.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.555
SO CLOSE AND YET...
SO FAR.

01:32.590 --> 01:36.378
I HATE TO BREAK
THIS UP, BUT WE HAVE A CASE.

01:40.630 --> 01:43.793
GARCIA: SO, REMEMBER
THAT OLD EXPRESSION,

01:43.830 --> 01:48.597
"DON'T GO SWIMMING WHILE
TETHERED TO A CINDER BLOCK"?

01:48.640 --> 01:52.736
NO? LARRY AND WANDA ROBBINS
FROM RAMONA, CALIFORNIA.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.169
NEWLYWEDS. THEY WERE
FOUND DEAD LAST NIGHT

01:55.210 --> 01:56.142
IN THEIR BACKYARD POOL.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.148
WANDA WAS SHOT
ONCE IN THE CHEST.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.171
LARRY WAS GAGGED
AND DROWNED

02:00.220 --> 02:02.142
BECAUSE THAT CINDER BLOCK
THING I MENTIONED EARLIER.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.817
LEWIS: ANYTHING STOLEN
FROM THE HOUSE?

02:03.850 --> 02:06.216
PRENTISS: JEWELRY WAS
MISSING FROM WANDA'S VANITY.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.511
THIS IS THE LATEST
IN A STRING

02:07.560 --> 02:08.913
OF BACKYARD POOL MURDERS
IN RAMONA

02:08.960 --> 02:10.655
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

02:10.690 --> 02:12.794
OH--THAT'S MY PART.
VICTIM NUMBER ONE,

02:12.830 --> 02:15.298
BEN STILES,
82-YEAR-OLD WIDOWER.

02:15.330 --> 02:16.524
HE WAS FOUND AT
THE BOTTOM OF HIS POOL,

02:16.570 --> 02:18.299
TIED TO A CINDER BLOCK,
LIKE LARRY ROBBINS.

02:18.330 --> 02:21.458
SIX DAYS LATER,
VICTIM NUMBER TWO,
BERT SCHOFIELD,

02:21.500 --> 02:22.808
DIVORCED, LIVED ALONE,

02:22.840 --> 02:25.229
AS YOU CAN SEE,
SAME KIND OF AWFULNESS.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.170
WERE THEIR HOUSES
ALSO BURGLARIZED?

02:27.210 --> 02:29.303
YEAH. WELL, BEN STILES' WAS.
HIS COIN COLLECTION WAS MISSING.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.908
I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT BERT SCHOFIELD.

02:30.950 --> 02:32.508
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
HAS BEEN TREATING THESE

02:32.550 --> 02:34.347
AS BURGLARIES
GONE WRONG, BUT...

02:34.380 --> 02:37.213
THE "GONE WRONG" PART COULD
HAVE BEEN EASILY AVOIDED.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.286
EXACTLY. STRAIGHT-UP
BURGLARY, THE UNSUB
WOULD HAVE MADE SURE

02:39.320 --> 02:40.810
THE HOMES
WERE UNOCCUPIED FIRST.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.259
LEWIS: AND HE WOULDN'T
HAVE WASTED TIME

02:42.290 --> 02:43.552
WITH DROWNINGS
AND CINDER BLOCKS.

02:43.590 --> 02:44.989
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN
IN AND OUT.

02:45.030 --> 02:47.191
SIMMONS: YEAH, IT'S PRE'ITY
OBVIOUS THE UNSUB WANTED
THESE OCCUPANTS DEAD.

02:47.230 --> 02:49.198
WE'VE GOT A LONG FLIGHT
AHEAD OF US.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.561
WHEELS UP IN 30.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.488
AAH! AAH! UHH! UHH!

03:19.630 --> 03:21.257
AAH!

03:44.790 --> 03:48.282
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.022
SIMMONS: A LAKOTA PROVERB WARNS,

03:57.070 --> 03:58.890
"DO NOT SPEAK OF EVIL,

03:58.930 --> 04:02.309
FOR IT CREATES CURIOSITY
IN THE HEART OF THE YOUNG."

04:02.340 --> 04:04.706
HAVE WE FOUND
A CONNECTION BETWEEN
THE VICTIMS YET, GARCIA?

04:04.740 --> 04:07.868
NONE. ALL OF THEM WERE
LONG-TIME AREA RESIDENTS,

04:07.910 --> 04:10.049
AND THEY ALL HAD
BACKYARD POOLS,
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.775
SIMMONS:
IT'S POSSIBLE THESE
KILLINGS ARE RANDOM.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.641
LEWIS: EXCEPT THE ITEMS
TAKEN WERE SO SPECIFIC.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.443
I MEAN, THE UNSUB MUST HAVE
HAD SOME FAMILIARITY

04:15.480 --> 04:16.788
WITH THE PEOPLE
HE TARGETED.

04:16.820 --> 04:18.412
GARCIA: OH, AND IT TURNS
OUT THAT BERT SCHOFIELD

04:18.450 --> 04:19.758
WAS, IN FACT, BURGLARIZED.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.781
HIS BOWLING TROPHIES WERE
MISSING FROM HIS GARAGE.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.981
BOWLING TROPHIES?
SERIOUSLY?

04:24.030 --> 04:26.692
I JUST REPORT THE FACTS
AS I FIND THEM, SIR.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.994
CURIOUS HOW ONLY
THE FEMALE WAS SHOT.

04:29.030 --> 04:31.294
WELL, THAT MEANS THE MEN
ARE MOST LIKELY
THE TRUE TARGETS.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.537
HE PUTS THEM THROUGH THESE
PROLONGED AGONIZING DEATHS

04:33.570 --> 04:35.731
WHEN THE GUN WOULD HAVE
DONE THE JOB QUICKLY.

04:35.770 --> 04:38.307
EITHER THAT OR HE FORGOT
AN EXTRA CINDER BLOCK

04:38.340 --> 04:39.773
WHEN HE WENT
TO THE ROBBINS' HOUSE.

04:39.810 --> 04:40.799
LEWIS: YOU KNOW, THIS
UNSUB DOESN'T STRIKE ME

04:40.840 --> 04:42.774
AS THE FORGETFUL TYPE.

04:42.810 --> 04:45.301
DAVE, JJ, GO TO
THE LATEST CRIME SCENE.

04:45.350 --> 04:46.908
LUKE, TARA,
TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS,

04:46.950 --> 04:47.712
SEE WHAT YOU CAN
FIND OUT

04:47.750 --> 04:49.513
ABOUT BEN STILES
AND BERT SCHOFIELD.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.656
MA'I'I', YOU AND I WILL SET UP
AT THE LOCAL PD.

04:58.930 --> 05:01.819
SMALL TOWN LIKE OURS,
WE'RE NOT USED TO THIS.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.327
FOLKS ARE JITI'ERY AS HELL.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.598
UNDERSTANDABLY.

05:04.630 --> 05:05.892
ROBBERY'S ONE THING,
AND LORD KNOWS

05:05.930 --> 05:07.363
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THAT
AROUND HERE LATELY.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.961
BUT THESE MURDERS...

05:11.010 --> 05:12.978
YOU'VE HAD AN INCREASE
IN ROBBERIES?

05:13.010 --> 05:15.331
YES, MA'AM. BURGLARIES,
PE'I'I'Y THEFI'S.

05:15.380 --> 05:16.802
IT'S ON ACCOUNT
OF THE DROUGHT.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.340
WHY WOULD LACK OF RAIN

05:18.380 --> 05:19.813
CAUSE AN INCREASE
IN BURGLARIES?

05:19.850 --> 05:21.374
OUR LOCAL ECONOMY
HAS TAKEN A HIT.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.888
A BIG CHUNK OF OUR
REVENUE IS FROM TOURISM

05:23.920 --> 05:26.753
AND OUTDOOR RECREATION--
FISHING, BOATING.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.610
BUT EVERYTHING'S
DRYING UP.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.981
WE HAD TO SHUT DOWN THE
MARINA UP AT LAKE PALMER

05:31.030 --> 05:32.952
AND CLOSE IT OFF
FROM FISHING.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.820
I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU FOLKS

05:34.860 --> 05:36.794
BROUGHT SOME RAIN-MAKING
SECRETS WITH YOU?

05:36.830 --> 05:39.697
WELL, THE BAU
HAS A VARIETY OF SKILL SETS.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.367
UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S NOT ONE OF THEM.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.938
ANYHOW, UH,
GOT YOU SET UP HERE.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.699
JUST LET ME KNOW IF
YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.004
GREAT.
THANK YOU, SHERIFF.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.871
THAT'S INTERESTING
WHAT THE SHERIFF SAID

05:52.920 --> 05:54.444
ABOUT THE DROUGHT.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.970
HE MIGHT BE
ON TO SOMETHING.

05:56.020 --> 05:57.988
WELL, EXCEPT WE'RE NOT
HERE TO SOLVE BURGLARIES.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.612
WE HAVE A SERIAL KILLER
ON THE LOOSE.

05:59.660 --> 06:04.029
LIKE I SAID, HE MIGHT
BE ON TO SOMETHING.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.051
WHAT, YOU THINK
THAT DROUGHT

06:06.090 --> 06:07.921
COULD ALSO BE TIED
INTO THE KILLINGS?

06:07.960 --> 06:09.427
LOOK AT THE CRIME
SCENES.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.165
POOL...

06:11.200 --> 06:13.430
POOL...

06:13.470 --> 06:14.869
POOL.

06:14.900 --> 06:15.889
IT'S CURIOUS

06:15.940 --> 06:17.703
WHEN A TOWN
WITHOUT WATER.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.776
SUDDENLY HAS A STRING
OF WATERY DEATHS.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.608
ROSSI: NO FORCED ENTRY
UP FRONT.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.039
GOOD BET THE UNSUB
CAME RIGHT THROUGH THE GATE,

06:29.080 --> 06:31.742
KILLED THE VICTIMS
OUT HERE AND PROBABLY

06:31.790 --> 06:33.985
ACCESSED THE HOME
FROM THE PORCH.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.908
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE WAS A STRUGGLE,

06:35.960 --> 06:37.928
BUT THE M.E.
SAID THAT THERE WERE
NO DEFENSIVE WOUNDS

06:37.960 --> 06:39.188
ON EITHER OF
THE VICTIMS.

06:39.230 --> 06:40.925
WELL, THE UNSUB
COULD HAVE TRASHED

06:40.960 --> 06:42.791
THE PLACE
AFTER THE FACT.

06:42.830 --> 06:44.764
MAYHEM FOR THE HELL OF IT.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.836
MEANS OUR GUY'S GOT

06:46.870 --> 06:48.064
A LOT OF RAGE.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.763
OK, SO WANDA ROBBINS
WAS PARTIALLY NUDE,

06:51.810 --> 06:54.608
BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.074
BUT GARCIA DID SAY
THEY WERE NEWLYWEDS.

06:57.110 --> 06:59.715
WARM NIGHT, CHAMPAGNE.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.945
I'M GUESSING HER TOP
WAS ALREADY OFF

07:01.980 --> 07:03.789
WHEN THE UNSUB
CRASHED THE PARTY.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.787
EXCUSE ME, AGENT.

07:04.820 --> 07:05.809
HERE YOU ARE.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.488
THANK YOU.
WHAT'S THAT?

07:07.520 --> 07:11.684
THE INSURANCE COMPANY'S LIST
OF THE MISSING JEWELRY.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.153
HMM, THAT'S ODD.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.124
THE UNSUB ONLY TOOK
WANDA'S COSTUME JEWELRY.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.024
THE VALUABLE STUFF
HE LEFT BEHIND.

07:19.070 --> 07:21.061
OUR UNSUB HAD TOO MUCH
PLANNING ON THIS

07:21.100 --> 07:22.601
TO DROP THE BALL
LIKE THAT.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.108
MAYBE THE THEFI'
IS A SMOKESCREEN.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.131
THESE WERE MURDERS
FROM JUMP,

07:27.180 --> 07:29.478
AND THE UNSUB GRABBED
THE FIRST THING HE SAW

07:29.510 --> 07:33.014
AFI'ERWARDS SO WE WOULD
THINK BURGLARY.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.047
HEY.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.978
ANY INFORMATION
ON THE FIRST TWO VICTIMS?

07:39.020 --> 07:40.112
NOT MUCH ON BEN STILES.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.787
HIS WIFE DIED
10 YEARS AGO

07:41.820 --> 07:43.128
AND HE PRETI'Y MUCH
KEPT TO HIMSELF AFI'ER THAT.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.957
HE HAD HEALTH ISSUES.
BARELY WENT OUT.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.594
SO THAT SHOULD
MAKE IT EASIER

07:46.630 --> 07:47.927
TO NARROW DOWN
WHO HAD ACCESS TO HIM

07:47.960 --> 07:49.598
OR KNEW ABOUT
THAT COIN COLLECTION.

07:49.630 --> 07:50.892
WHICH WAS JUST
SOME SILVER DOLLARS,

07:50.930 --> 07:52.022
BY THE WAY,
NOT WORTH MUCH.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.833
IT WAS MORE OF
A HOBBY WITH STILES.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.838
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM UP AT LAKE PALMER.

07:55.870 --> 07:57.132
BEN STILES'
COIN COLLECTION

07:57.170 --> 07:59.161
IS SCATTERED
ALL ALONG THE SHORE.

08:07.650 --> 08:09.049
IT'S QUITE
ALL RIGHT.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.843
MAN: NO WAY OF KEEPING
SOME OF THESE COINS?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.653
WE NEED THEM FOR
EVIDENCE FOR AN
ONGOING INVESTIGATION...

08:12.690 --> 08:14.055
OH, OK.

08:14.090 --> 08:14.954
LEWIS: I JUST DON'T GET IT.
I MEAN, THE UNSUB

08:14.990 --> 08:17.026
GOES THROUGH ALL
THE TROUBLE TO STEAL THESE

08:17.060 --> 08:18.789
ONLY TO TURN AROUND
AND THROW THEM IN THE LAKE?

08:18.830 --> 08:22.027
THE GUY DIDN'T PUT
A WHOLE LOT OF
HEAVE-HO INTO IT.

08:22.060 --> 08:25.291
YOU KNOW, WE FOUND THEM RIGHT
HERE AT THE WATER'S EDGE.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.991
PROBLEM?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.861
GENTLEMAN SAID HE FOUND THE
SILVER DOLLARS AN HOUR AGO

08:29.910 --> 08:31.537
WALKING THE SHORE.

08:31.570 --> 08:33.276
HE'S NOT TOO HAPPY. I TOLD
HIM HE CAN'T KEEP THEM.

08:33.310 --> 08:34.675
WHY DID HE CALL
THE POLICE, THEN?

08:34.710 --> 08:36.075
PRENTISS: HE DIDN'T.
A WOMAN NEARBY

08:36.110 --> 08:38.044
REMEMBERED THAT SILVER DOLLARS
WERE STOLEN FROM BEN STILES.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.308
SHE'S THE ONE WHO CALLED.

08:39.350 --> 08:40.840
PRACTICALLY
IN PLAIN SIGHT.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.017
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
THE UNSUB WANTED

08:42.050 --> 08:43.745
THESE COINS
TO BE DISCOVERED.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.143
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A FORENSIC COUNTERMEASURE.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.714
LOOK AT THESE SHINY
THINGS OVER HERE

08:46.760 --> 08:48.057
WHILE I GO OVER THERE.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.626
THAT WOULD BOLSTER
OUR THEORY

08:49.660 --> 08:51.252
THAT THE BURGLARIES
WERE JUST FOR SHOW.

08:51.290 --> 08:53.053
LEWIS: YEAH, BUT IF
THE UNSUB WANTED TO SELL

08:53.100 --> 08:54.954
THESE HOME INVASIONS
AS LEGIT ROBBERIES,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.194
HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN JUNK.

08:56.230 --> 08:57.959
HE WOULD HAVE
STOLEN SOMETHING VALUABLE.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.298
IS THAT A BODY BAG?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.069
DAMN.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.307
ANOTHER ONE.

09:04.340 --> 09:06.729
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:06.780 --> 09:09.578
REMEMBER I SAID THIS TOWN
IS ON PINS AND NEEDLES?

09:09.610 --> 09:11.601
THIS IS WHAT
KICKED IT OFF.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.208
THERE ARE BODIES
IN THE LAKE?

09:13.250 --> 09:14.274
OLD BODIES.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.084
SKELETONS, MORE LIKE.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.145
LAKE PALMER IS
A MAN-MADE RESERVOIR.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.658
BEFORE IT GOT FLOODED,
ALL OF THIS OUT HERE

09:21.690 --> 09:23.829
WAS JUST RUGGED CANYON.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.657
SO IF SOMEONE DROWNS,

09:25.690 --> 09:28.693
THEY TEND TO GET TANGLED
IN THE SUBMERGED TREES.

09:28.730 --> 09:33.167
HARDLY EVER MAKE IT
BACK UP TO THE SURFACE.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.135
BUT WITH THIS DROUGHT...

09:36.170 --> 09:39.230
THE SURFACE
IS COMING DOWN TO THEM.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.760
HEY, MISTER.

10:05.030 --> 10:06.793
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.131
NOTHING.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.808
IT LOOKS GROSS.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.809
ARE YOU LIVING
IN THERE?

10:14.840 --> 10:16.979
IT'S OK IF YOU ARE.

10:17.010 --> 10:19.240
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

10:19.280 --> 10:22.408
MY NAM E'S TIM.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.714
HEY, THEY FOUND
ANOTHER BODY,

10:24.750 --> 10:27.287
YOU KNOW, JUST NOW.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.118
MY MOM AND DAD
ARE FREAKED OUT.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.650
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN
COME TO THE LAKE NOW.

10:31.690 --> 10:32.998
BUT I'M NOT SCARED.

10:33.030 --> 10:35.191
WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE?

10:35.230 --> 10:37.664
THE BODY.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.736
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS IN A BAG.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.802
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN GHOSTS?

10:51.380 --> 10:53.143
OH, ME, TOO.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.148
I BET THERE ARE
TONS OF THEM OUT HERE.

10:55.180 --> 10:58.809
AND ALL THESE DEAD
PEOPLE COMING OUT.

11:02.190 --> 11:05.227
LAKE PALMER'S A GOOD 10 MILES
FROM OUR CRIME SCENE,

11:05.260 --> 11:08.229
AND THAT'S A LONG WAY TO GO
JUST TO DUMP SOME COINS.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.093
ROSSI: THE KILLER MIGHT
WORK OR LIVE THERE.

11:11.130 --> 11:13.337
WHAT'S THE POPULATION
OF LAKE PALMER, SHERIFF?

11:13.370 --> 11:15.190
IT DEPENDS
ON THE SEASON.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.164
YEAR-ROUND,
A COUPLE OF THOUSAND,
I'D SAY. LESS, MAYBE.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.201
THERE'S A DISCONNECT
WITH THIS UNSUB.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.175
ON THE ONE HAND,
THE CRIME SCENES
ARE EXTREMELY ORGANIZED.

11:23.210 --> 11:25.747
THAT WOULD SUGGEST A KILLER
WITH MATURITY AND SKILL.

11:25.780 --> 11:29.216
BUT THEN HE GRABS
THESE BRIGHT, SHINY ITEMS

11:29.250 --> 11:31.309
OF LITTLE MONETARY VALUE--

11:31.350 --> 11:34.979
THE SILVER DOLLARS,
COSTUME JEWELRY,
BOWLING TROPHIES.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.056
YEAH, IT'S LIKE
HE SUDDENLY REVERTS

11:37.090 --> 11:38.978
TO IMMATURE
AND IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOR.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.158
THE THEFI'S COULD BE PURELY
SYMBOLIC, BUT OF WHAT?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.724
IT MIGHT BE
ABOUT THE LAKE,

11:43.770 --> 11:45.863
I MEAN, WITH EVERYTHING
GOING ON THERE.

11:45.900 --> 11:47.891
HUMAN REMAINS FISHED
FROM TREE LIMBS?

11:47.940 --> 11:51.205
AS UNSUB TRIGGERS GO,
THAT'S HALL OF FAME MATERIAL.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.038
PRENTISS: HOW MANY HAVE
DROWNED THERE IN THE LAST YEARS?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.071
9 THAT WE KNOW OF.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.338
SHERIFF, WHEN THEY WERE
PULLING THE BODY IN,

11:57.380 --> 11:59.974
YOU SAID "ANOTHER ONE."

12:00.020 --> 12:01.373
YES, MA'AM.

12:01.420 --> 12:05.083
THEY'VE PULLED 5
OUT OF THERE SO FAR.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.179
PRENTISS: WHEN WAS
THE FIRST BODY RETRIEVED?

12:07.220 --> 12:08.482
NOVEMBER 22nd.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.283
I REMEMBER BECAUSE
I WAS GETTING

12:10.330 --> 12:14.357
MY THANKSGIVING TURKEY
WHEN I GOT THE CALL.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.129
ANY OTHER RETRIEVALS?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.799
WELL...

12:18.830 --> 12:22.095
THE NEXT WAS PULLED
OUT OF THE LAKE
ON NOVEMBER 28th.

12:24.840 --> 12:29.277
THE OTHER TWO BODIES
WERE RECOVERED
ON DECEMBER 3rd.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.411
I'LL BE DAMNED.

12:38.450 --> 12:41.351
AND THAT IS WHAT WE IN
THE SERIAL KILLER BUSINESS

12:41.390 --> 12:43.381
REFER TO AS A PATTERN.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.421
PRENTISS: WE NEED TO NOTIFY
EVERY HOMEOWNER

12:45.460 --> 12:47.519
WITHIN A 20-MILE RADIUS
WHO HAS A BACKYARD POOL.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.166
THIS UNSUB WILL STRIKE AGAIN
WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.365
NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:01.040 --> 13:03.304
AAH!

13:03.350 --> 13:05.500
UHH!

13:08.480 --> 13:10.380
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:12.350 --> 13:15.012
AAH--AAH--OHH!

13:15.060 --> 13:18.848
AAH, AAH, AAH! AAH...

13:25.870 --> 13:28.134
THE PLACE WAS RANSACKED.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.592
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT
WAS TAKEN, IF ANYTHING.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.562
LEWIS: THE VICTIM'S NAME
IS WALTER KNIGHT.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.305
MARRIED, FATHER OF TWO.

13:33.340 --> 13:35.171
THE UNSUB DIDN'T NEED
A CINDER BLOCK THIS TIME.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.849
THIS CHAIR WAS HEAW ENOUGH
TO SINK HIM TO THE BOTTOM.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.542
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE
A SHROUD.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.418
CALIFORNIA KING, 500-WEAVE.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.214
IT'S A BED SHEET.
UNSUB TOOK IT FROM INSIDE.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.921
WE KNOW WHERE WALTER'S
WIFE AND KIDS ARE?

13:50.960 --> 13:52.552
FLORIDA,
VISITING RELATIVES.

13:52.590 --> 13:55.525
THIS IS A DEVIATION
FROM HIS USUAL M.O.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.222
IT COULD BE
A SIGN OF REMORSE.

14:01.170 --> 14:03.604
NOT THAT REMORSEFUL.

14:06.610 --> 14:08.373
SO THE UNSUB SEWED HIM UP,

14:08.410 --> 14:09.968
STUCK THIS NEEDLE
THROUGH HIS NOSE,

14:10.010 --> 14:11.500
DUMPED THE CHAIR
INTO THE POOL.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.575
LEVEL OF SADISM'S
RATCHETING UP.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.417
WE GOTTA FIND THIS GUY FAST.

14:15.450 --> 14:18.487
PRENTISS: THE UNSUB APPEARS TO
BE KILLING AS A DIRECT RESPONSE

14:18.520 --> 14:21.956
TO THE OLD ACCIDENT VICTIMS
BEING PULLED FROM THE LAKE.

14:21.990 --> 14:25.949
SO WHY IS HE DUMPING
THE STOLEN PROPERTY
INTO THE LAKE

14:25.990 --> 14:27.924
INSTEAD OF
THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.427
MAYBE THE COINS
ARE AN OFFERING,

14:29.460 --> 14:31.189
SOME KIND OF SUPERSTITION.

14:31.230 --> 14:32.527
PRENTISS:
WHAT IF WE'VE HAD THIS
ALL BACKWARDS UNTIL NOW?

14:32.570 --> 14:34.060
IN WHAT WAY?

14:34.100 --> 14:35.965
WE WERE THINKING
THAT THE ITEMS HE STOLE

14:36.000 --> 14:38.036
WERE UNIMPORTANT,
AFTERTHOUGHTS.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.129
BUT WHAT IF JUST
THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE,

14:40.180 --> 14:43.672
THAT IT'S 100%
ABOUT THE STOLEN ITEMS?

14:43.710 --> 14:45.473
ROSSI: I JUST GOT
OFF THE PHONE WITH REID.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.273
THAT STITCH
THROUGH THE NOSE,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.470
IT'S AN OCEAN-BURYING
TRADITION

14:49.520 --> 14:50.919
FROM CENTURIES AGO.

14:50.950 --> 14:53.316
IT WAS ESPECIALLY COMMON
AMONG PIRATES.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.612
JJ: LOVELY.
AND THE REASON BEING?

14:55.660 --> 14:57.082
ROSSI: TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE BODY

14:57.130 --> 14:58.529
THEY WERE ABOUT
TO THROW OVERBOARD

15:03.370 --> 15:05.668
SO DEATH BY DROWNING,

15:05.700 --> 15:08.032
PILLAGE AND PLUNDER,

15:08.070 --> 15:10.607
NOW THIS PIRATE
BURIAL TRADITION.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.505
I THINK I KNOW WHY THE UNSUB

15:12.540 --> 15:15.634
IS CHOOSING THESE POOLS
OVER OTHERS.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.602
DIVING BOARDS.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.470
THEY ALL HAVE
A PLANK TO WALK.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.120
HEY.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.426
I THOUGHT NOBODY COULD
FISH ON THE LAKE ANYMORE.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.064
THEY CAN'T.

15:42.240 --> 15:45.164
YOU LOOK LIKE A PIRATE
WITH THAT THING ON YOUR EYE.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.677
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

15:52.710 --> 15:54.371
LEWIS:
ROSSI JUST CALLED.

15:54.420 --> 15:55.648
THEY JUST RECOVERED

15:55.680 --> 15:57.238
ANOTHER BODY
FROM THE LAKE.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.518
NOW, IT WAS ALL DONE
COVERTLY,

15:58.550 --> 16:01.087
SO, HOPEFULLY,
THE UNSUB IS UNAWARE.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.384
JJ: OK, WELL, WE PROFILED
THE UNSUB WAS STUCK

16:03.430 --> 16:05.386
IN EARLY ADOLESCENCE.

16:05.430 --> 16:06.988
SOMETHING HAD TO HAVE
HAPPENED TO HIM, WHAT,

16:07.030 --> 16:09.191
20 YEARS AGO, TO CAUSE
THE SHOCK TO HIS SYSTEM.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.221
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I MEAN, IF THIS IS
ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT,

16:11.270 --> 16:13.261
SOMETHING ARRESTED IT.

16:13.300 --> 16:15.689
THE RESERVOIR WAS CREATED
AROUND THAT TIME.

16:15.740 --> 16:17.230
YEAH.

16:17.270 --> 16:19.602
WHAT IF THE KILLER'S
TRAUMA OCCURRED

16:19.640 --> 16:22.575
OUT THERE BEFORE
THE RESERVOIR WAS FORMED?

16:22.610 --> 16:23.599
ALVEZ: OR DURING.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.742
GARCIA?

16:24.780 --> 16:26.145
COME GET IT, BAE.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.147
THE LAND
THAT WAS FLOODED

16:27.180 --> 16:28.340
TO FORM LAKE PALMER,

16:28.380 --> 16:29.574
DID ANYONE LIVE
OR WORK OUT THERE?

16:29.620 --> 16:32.009
IT'S PRETTY REMOTE COUNTRY,

16:32.050 --> 16:34.416
BUT, YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE WERE 3 HOMES
IN THE CANYON.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.610
ALVEZ: I ASSUME THEY WERE
ALL SUBJECT TO EMINENT DOMAIN?

16:36.660 --> 16:39.686
GARCIA: CORRECT. THE CITY
BOUGHT OUT THOSE 3 FAMILIES.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.288
DO WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE RESIDENTS?

16:41.330 --> 16:44.265
TWO OF THEM MOVED TO HOUSES

16:44.300 --> 16:45.767
BY THE SIDE OF THE NEW LAKE.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.735
THE THIRD ONE IS PROVING
TO BE A LITTLE TRICKIER.

16:48.770 --> 16:51.136
BOB TURNER,
AN OFF-THE-GRIDISH TYPE,

16:51.170 --> 16:55.573
BUT HE VANISHED RIGHT BEFORE
THE NEW RESERVOIR WAS CREATED.

16:55.610 --> 16:58.602
I DON'T HAVE A TRACE OF HIM
AFTER THAT, BUT FRET NOT.

16:58.650 --> 17:01.448
THERE'S THE GRID,
AND THEN THERE'S
THE GARCIA GRID,

17:01.480 --> 17:04.040
AND THAT ONE IS NOT
AS EASY TO STAY OFF OF.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.717
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
OF COURSE YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.308
GOOD-BYE.

17:22.240 --> 17:23.707
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

17:25.410 --> 17:29.574
THEY JUST IDENTIFIED
THE MOST RECENT
SET OF REMAINS.

17:29.610 --> 17:31.578
TYLER HART, COLLEGE
KID WHO GOT KILLED

17:31.610 --> 17:33.669
IN A JET SKI ACCIDENT
BACK IN 2003.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.676
DID YOU KNOW HIM?

17:35.720 --> 17:39.747
NO. BUT EVERY TIME THEY
BRING IN SOMEONE NEW,

17:39.790 --> 17:42.111
IT'S LIKE PLAYING
RUSSIAN ROULETTE.

17:42.160 --> 17:46.119
WELL, IT CAN'T BE
RUSSIAN ROULETTE

17:46.160 --> 17:51.268
UNLESS THERE'S A BULLET
IN ONE OF THE CHAMBERS.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.619
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.661
PLEASE.

17:59.710 --> 18:03.100
HER NAME WAS
HOLLY FREEMAN.

18:03.150 --> 18:06.347
SHE WAS MY HIGH-SCHOOL
SWEETHEART.

18:06.380 --> 18:09.679
SHE DROWNED OUT ON THE
LAKE A COUPLE YEARS AGO

18:09.720 --> 18:11.244
WHILE BOATING
WITH HER FAMILY.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.689
I'M SORRY.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.450
ME AND HOLLY ENDED UP
MARRYING DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

18:15.490 --> 18:18.527
DIDN'T WORK OUT
SO WELL FOR ME,

18:18.560 --> 18:20.289
BUT HERS DID.

18:20.330 --> 18:21.729
NICE HUSBAND.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.263
HAD 3 BEAUTIFUL
DAUGHTERS.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.596
IT WASN'T IN THE CARDS,
AGENT ROSSI, BUT...

18:28.640 --> 18:32.201
I ALWAYS FELT LIKE
SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO GOT AWAY.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.208
CRAZY, RIGHT?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.538
THE GIRL YOU
TOOK TO THE PROM.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.708
NO. NOT SO CRAZY.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.547
I HOLD MY DAMN BREATH
EVERY TIME THEY

18:41.580 --> 18:44.287
BRING IN SOMEONE NEW,
AFRAID IT MIGHT BE HER.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.779
THE CHANCE FOR
A PROPER BURIAL

18:48.820 --> 18:50.549
MIGHT NOT BE
THE WORST THING.

18:50.590 --> 18:53.821
IT GIVES HER LOVED ONES
SOME CLOSURE.

18:53.860 --> 18:57.227
CLOSURE.

18:58.870 --> 19:01.794
YOU WANT TO HEAR
MY IDEA ABOUT CLOSURE?

19:01.840 --> 19:05.708
LET THE DEAD
REST IN PEACE.

19:05.740 --> 19:09.870
I WANT TO REMEMBER HOLLY
LIKE SHE WAS,

19:09.910 --> 19:11.798
NOT LIKE THIS.

19:22.560 --> 19:23.720
WHOA.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.421
THIS IS SO COOL.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.950
HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD IT?

19:26.990 --> 19:28.491
A LONG TIME.

19:28.530 --> 19:30.589
WHAT'S THIS?

19:36.240 --> 19:38.731
IT'S A FLAG.

19:38.770 --> 19:40.635
FROM WHAT?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.432
WELL, I HAD A FRIEND,

19:42.480 --> 19:44.300
AND WE MADE A BLOOD VOW.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.908
RECITED THE PIRATES'
CODE,

19:45.950 --> 19:50.740
AND THEN--AND THEN WE
CUT OUR HANDS AND WE...

19:50.790 --> 19:52.917
AND WE HELD THEM
TOGETHER.

19:55.860 --> 20:00.320
MM...WE COULD
DO IT, TOO.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.453
YOU AND ME.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.798
REALLY?

20:04.830 --> 20:06.923
YEAH.

20:06.970 --> 20:09.359
BUT...

20:09.400 --> 20:11.504
WELL, FIRST YOU'D
HAVE TO PROVE YOURSELF.

20:11.540 --> 20:12.837
HOW?

20:14.840 --> 20:19.868
YOU'D HAVE TO SPEND
A NIGHT OUT AT THE LAKE.

20:19.910 --> 20:22.640
ALONE.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.841
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

20:26.520 --> 20:27.657
I CAN'T.

20:27.690 --> 20:28.884
WAIT. ARE--ARE
YOU AFRAID?

20:28.920 --> 20:32.378
NO. BUT MY MOM AND DAD

20:32.430 --> 20:33.897
WILL GET WORRIED
IF I DON'T GET HOME.

20:33.930 --> 20:38.663
ARE YOU A PIRATE
OR A SCARED LI'ITLE BOY?

20:45.310 --> 20:47.528
GOTCHA.

20:48.580 --> 20:49.831
WHAT IS IT, GARCIA?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.848
GARCIA: BOB TURNER,
OUR MISSING CANYON DWELLER,

20:51.880 --> 20:54.769
HAS GONE FROM OFF THE GRID
TO GRIDLOCKED.

20:54.820 --> 20:57.914
TURNS OUT BOB TURNER
ISN'T EVEN HIS REAL NAME.

20:57.950 --> 21:00.510
IT'S CASEY PETERS,
AND MR. PETERS

21:00.560 --> 21:01.811
HAS WHAT I WOULD
DIPLOMATICALLY CALL

21:01.860 --> 21:03.680
A SKETCHY HISTORY.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.958
SKETCHY HOW?

21:04.990 --> 21:07.891
EMBEZZLEMENT,
FRAUD, FORGERY.
I COULD GO ON.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.989
HE'S LIVED MOSTLY IN
FLORIDA AND THE CAROLINAS.

21:10.030 --> 21:11.895
WHAT BROUGHT HIM
TO RAMONA, CALIFORNIA?

21:11.930 --> 21:14.296
A PLACE TO HIDE OUT,
APPARENTLY.

21:14.340 --> 21:15.329
FROM WHAT?

21:15.370 --> 21:16.496
SOMETHING TO DO
WITH MONEY.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.837
MONTHS BEFORE THE CANYON
WAS FLOODED,

21:17.870 --> 21:20.304
FEDERAL TREASURY AGENTS
WERE CLOSING IN ON HIM.

21:20.340 --> 21:22.001
AND THAT'S WHEN HE PULLED
UP STAKES IN RAMONA

21:22.040 --> 21:23.405
AND VANISHED.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.678
DO WE KNOW
WHERE HE IS NOW?

21:24.710 --> 21:27.008
WE DO NOT,
BUT I AM ON THE HUNT.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.974
I AM SENDING YOU
A DMV PHOTO OF CASEY PETERS

21:30.020 --> 21:32.944
FROM HIS BOB TURNER DAYS.

21:32.990 --> 21:36.482
I KNOW THAT GUY--
FROM THE LAKE.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.784
YEAH. THAT'S THE GUY
WHO FOUND THE COINS.

21:46.900 --> 21:49.494
HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

21:49.540 --> 21:51.007
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.032
YOU MIND TAKING OFF
YOUR HAT AND SUNGLASSES?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.570
DO WHAT?

21:55.610 --> 21:57.999
THE HAT AND GLASSES,
JUST FOR A SECOND.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.644
SORRY. THAT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, PAL.

22:06.990 --> 22:11.051
SERIOUSLY, MAN, I'M DRYING
TO DRY

22:13.060 --> 22:16.723
WHAT THE HELL
IS YOUR PROBLEM, HUH?

22:16.760 --> 22:19.069
THE SUNGLASSES.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.931
ARE YOU DRUNK OR SOMETHING?
DO NOT TOUCH--

22:20.970 --> 22:22.460
FBI!

22:23.570 --> 22:25.800
ALVEZ: CASEY PETERS,
LET ME SEE
YOUR HANDS.

22:25.840 --> 22:29.378
JJ: AH-AH-AH. DON'T
EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

22:32.950 --> 22:37.011
SO, WHICH ONE OF US
TELLS THEM PETERS
IS NOT OUR UNSUB?

22:37.050 --> 22:39.644
HE DOESN'T REMOTELY
FIT THE PROFILE.

22:39.690 --> 22:42.011
I KNOW. IT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S GUILT-FREE, THOUGH.

22:42.060 --> 22:45.086
PETERS IS TIED
INTO THIS SOMEHOW.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.882
ESCONDIDO PD JUST CALLED.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.795
CASEY PETERS WAS LOCKED UP

22:48.830 --> 22:52.061
OVER THERE NOVEMBER 20th
THROUGH THE 24th
ON A DRUNK AND DISORDERLY.

22:52.100 --> 22:55.035
MEANS HE WAS IN CUSTODY
WHEN BEN STILES WAS MURDERED.

22:55.070 --> 22:57.061
ROSSI: CONVENIENT.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.001
HAPPY ACCIDENT OR PART OF
HIS PLAN TO BUILD AN ALIBI?

23:00.040 --> 23:01.029
PRENTISS:
WHY DON'T WE ASK HIM?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.035
I GO'ITA WARN YOU,
HE'S NOT

23:02.080 --> 23:03.479
IN A VERY
TALKATIVE MOOD.

23:03.510 --> 23:04.807
OH, THAT'S OK.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.717
WE SPECIALIZE
IN MOOD ADJUSTMENT.

23:08.850 --> 23:11.683
GOOD EVENING, MR. PETERS.
I'M SSA PRENTISS.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.018
THIS IS SSA ROSSI.
WE'RE WITH THE FBI.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.948
WE HAVE SOME
QUESTIONS TO ASK.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.788
SO, WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO LAKE PALMER?

23:20.530 --> 23:23.465
PRENTISS: DO YOU
LIVE IN THE AREA?

23:23.500 --> 23:25.661
ROSSI: WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?

23:25.700 --> 23:28.134
WE'LL TALK, AND YOU SIT THERE
PRACT ICING YOUR STONEWALLING,

23:28.170 --> 23:29.967
BECAUSE WE ALREADY
KNOW A LOT.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.139
BACK IN THE NINETIES,
YOU GOT INTO TROUBLE

23:32.170 --> 23:34.138
WITH THE LAW
DOWN IN FLORIDA--

23:34.180 --> 23:36.034
EMBEZZLING,
WRITING BAD CHECKS.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.172
THEN YOU MOVED
TO RAMONA,

23:37.210 --> 23:38.609
YOU CHANGED
YOUR IDENTITY,

23:38.650 --> 23:40.003
AND YOU HID OUT
IN THE CANYON.

23:40.050 --> 23:42.018
AND THEN RIGHT BEFORE
THEY FLOODED THE CANYON,

23:42.050 --> 23:43.847
YOU PACKED UP AGAIN
AND TOOK OFF.

23:43.890 --> 23:46.586
NOW, LO AND BEHOLD,
YOU ARE BACK

23:46.620 --> 23:48.156
AT THE EXACT
SAME TIME

23:48.190 --> 23:49.657
THESE MURDERS
STARTED UP.

23:49.690 --> 23:51.658
NEWS FLASH--I WAS IN JAIL

23:51.690 --> 23:53.954
WHEN THE FIRST GUY
GOT KILLED.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.093
ROSSI: WELL, THAT GUY YOU WERE
HASSLING OUT ON THE DOCK,

23:56.130 --> 23:57.859
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

23:57.900 --> 24:00.630
YOU CAN ASK
ALL THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT.

24:00.670 --> 24:02.661
I'M DONE TALKING.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.176
OHH! OOH!

24:43.210 --> 24:45.508
NO! NO!

25:00.060 --> 25:01.857
PRENTISS: YEAH, GARCIA.

25:01.900 --> 25:04.266
IT'S PIECES-FALL-INTO-PLACE
DAY HERE AT GARCIA CENTRAL.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.599
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT
OLD RAMONA PUBLIC RECORDS

25:07.640 --> 25:09.096
FOR ALL THINGS BOB TURNER,

25:09.140 --> 25:11.563
AND ANOTHER TURNER
CAUGHT MY EYE--

25:11.610 --> 25:12.861
A LELAND TURNER.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.571
IN 1997,
HE WAS 13 YEARS OLD.

25:14.610 --> 25:17.101
HE HAS A LONG JUVIE RECORD,
NO FAMILY HISTORY.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.075
AND HE LISTED HIS ADDRESS
AS PALMER CANYON ROAD.

25:20.110 --> 25:22.613
THAT'S THE ROAD THAT USED
TO LEAD TO THE RESIDENCES

25:22.650 --> 25:24.242
IN THE FLOODED CANYON.

25:25.820 --> 25:28.186
CASEY PETERS HAD A SON.

25:45.070 --> 25:46.207
I DID IT.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.333
I SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT
BY THE LAKE.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.109
YOU'RE READY NOW.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.300
COME ON.

25:58.350 --> 26:02.081
WELL, I GO'ITA GIVE YOU
A TIP OF THE HAT, CASEY.

26:02.120 --> 26:05.783
IT IS NOT EASY TO EVADE

26:05.830 --> 26:08.697
LAW ENFORCEMENT
FOR 20 YEARS.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.766
AND IF YOU HADN'T COME
BACK TO LAKE PALMER,

26:10.800 --> 26:12.722
YOU'D STILL BE OUT THERE
FREE AS A BIRD.

26:12.770 --> 26:17.161
BUT YOU'RE HERE. WHY?

26:17.200 --> 26:19.930
THAT BOAT OWNER
DOWN AT THE DOCK--

26:19.970 --> 26:21.369
I THINK YOU WERE
TRYING TO SEE

26:21.410 --> 26:22.832
IF MAYBE THAT WAS
YOUR SON LELAND

26:22.880 --> 26:24.848
BEHIND THOSE SUNGLASSES.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.700
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT LELAND?

26:26.750 --> 26:29.344
CASEY, PEOPLE ARE DYING,
AND WE'RE ON A CLOCK.

26:29.380 --> 26:32.087
SO IF YOU KNOW
WHERE LELAND IS,
YOU NEED TO TELL US.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.680
I DON'T.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.359
I HAVEN'T SEEN
MY BOY IN 20 YEARS.

26:37.390 --> 26:39.051
BUT WHEN YOU HEARD
ABOUT THESE MURDERS,

26:39.090 --> 26:40.694
YOU THOUGHT HE
MIGHT BE INVOLVED.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.618
THAT'S WHY YOU
CAME BACK.

26:42.660 --> 26:45.060
LELAND DIDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE RAMONA.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.365
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO.
WE GOT INTO THIS FIGHT.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.836
BOY RUNS AWAY.
THAT'S THE LAST
I EVER SAW HIM.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.773
HE WAS 13 YEARS OLD.

26:55.810 --> 26:57.846
DID YOU LOOK
FOR HIM?

26:57.880 --> 27:01.816
CALLED AROUND,
ASKED SOME PEOPLE.

27:01.850 --> 27:03.738
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I COULD WALK INTO
A POLICE STATION

27:03.790 --> 27:06.111
AND FILE A REPORT.
I HAD MY OWN PROBLEMS.

27:08.160 --> 27:12.358
CASEY, DID YOUR SON
LIKE TO PLAY
AT BEING A PIRATE?

27:12.390 --> 27:14.858
YEAH.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.666
HE DID. WHY?

27:18.700 --> 27:20.361
WHOEVER'S COMMI'ITING
THESE MURDERS IN RAMONA,

27:20.400 --> 27:23.164
IT'S TIED INTO
A PIRATE FANTASY.

27:28.740 --> 27:31.004
ARE YOU SMILING,
MR. PETERS?

27:31.050 --> 27:32.972
HE'S ALIVE.

27:33.010 --> 27:35.649
MY BOY IS OUT THERE.

27:38.790 --> 27:40.951
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

27:40.990 --> 27:43.356
TO STERILIZE IT.

27:43.390 --> 27:45.358
DOES IT HURT?

27:47.290 --> 27:50.293
A REAL PIRATE DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT PAIN.

27:53.330 --> 27:58.063
AND AFTER WE DO THIS,
WE CAN GO.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.759
GO WHERE?

27:59.810 --> 28:01.402
THE LAKE.
TO THE TREASURE.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.147
THERE'S TREASURE
AT THE LAKE?

28:12.850 --> 28:15.489
DO YOU TRUST ME?

28:15.520 --> 28:17.681
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.422
ALL RIGHT.

28:49.290 --> 28:52.453
WE SAIL
UNDER A BLACK FLAG.

28:52.490 --> 28:55.425
WE LIVE THE WAY
THAT WE WANT TO LIVE.

28:55.460 --> 29:01.831
AND WE TRAIN TO FIGHT
AGAINST ALL OF OUR ENEMIES.

29:03.500 --> 29:05.468
YAAH!

29:08.180 --> 29:10.535
WE TAKE WHAT WE WANT.

29:10.580 --> 29:15.813
BUT WE--WE ALWAYS
DEFEND OUR TREASURE.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.818
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU TAKE THE BLOOD OATH.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.852
WE SWEAR TO DEFEND
THE TREASURE

29:25.890 --> 29:27.357
TO THE DEATH.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.789
TO THE DEATH.

29:28.830 --> 29:30.525
AND BEWARE THE CURSE.

29:30.560 --> 29:34.530
TO ANY PIRATE WHO WOULD
GO AGAINST THE OATH,

29:34.570 --> 29:36.299
MAY HE BE VISITED
BY THE GHOSTS

29:36.340 --> 29:39.969
OF ALL THE PIRATES
WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE.

29:52.320 --> 29:57.189
LELAND KNEW THE--
THE POWER OF THE CURSE.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.381
WHO'S LELAND?

30:02.330 --> 30:06.096
WE HAVE TO DEFEND
THE TREASURE.

30:06.130 --> 30:12.899
THEN THEY--THEY FLOODED
OUR HIDING PLACE. THEY--

30:12.940 --> 30:16.535
YOU MEAN THE TREASURE
GOT FLOODED.

30:16.580 --> 30:19.606
LELAND SAID--HE SAID THAT
WE NEEDED TO STAND GUARD

30:19.650 --> 30:23.518
UNTIL WE COULD MOVE
THE TREASURE SOMEPLACE ELSE.

30:23.550 --> 30:25.848
YOU GOTTA DO IT.

30:25.890 --> 30:28.279
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

30:30.990 --> 30:35.359
AND THEN THAT MORNING,
HE WENT DOWN TO THE TREASURE

30:35.400 --> 30:37.425
TO STAND GUARD, AND...

30:44.640 --> 30:47.564
AND I WAS--I WAS
TOO AFRAID,

30:47.610 --> 30:50.408
SO I STAYED HOME,
AND IT...

30:58.690 --> 31:00.908
I BROKE THE OATH.

31:06.560 --> 31:10.121
AND THEN THEY LET
ALL THE WATER IN.

31:29.150 --> 31:31.687
I BE'ITER GET GOING.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.210
I TOLD MY PARENTS
I SPENT THE NIGHT

31:33.250 --> 31:34.911
AT KEVIN'S HOUSE.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.588
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:37.620 --> 31:40.418
PIRATES
STICK TOGETHER.

31:40.460 --> 31:41.950
I NEED TO G0.
I JUST--

31:42.000 --> 31:43.126
NO. YOU CAN'T GO.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.162
NO, YOU CAN'T.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.521
I CAME BACK TO THE LAKE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT

31:47.570 --> 31:49.333
AND TO ADD
TO THE TREASURE.

31:49.370 --> 31:52.032
AND THEN--AND THEN
I FOUND YOU,

31:52.070 --> 31:55.107
A FELLOW PIRATE.

31:55.140 --> 31:59.008
LELAND'S GONNA
FORGIVE ME NOW. I KNOW.

32:00.410 --> 32:04.540
WE'RE BROTHERS NOW,
ALL THREE OF US...

32:04.590 --> 32:07.013
IN LIFE...

32:07.050 --> 32:08.608
AND IN DEATH.

32:13.260 --> 32:17.219
IT'S NOT JUST MY BLOOD
THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.967
IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S, TOO.

32:21.400 --> 32:25.336
WELL, LELAND'S JUVIE HISTORY
WAS PRETTY INNOCUOUS.

32:25.370 --> 32:27.531
VANDALISM, SHOPLIl-TING.
HARDLY GATEWAY CRIMES

32:27.570 --> 32:29.208
TO THE LIFE
OF A SERIAL KILLER.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.969
WELL, EVERY GROWN-UP MONSTER

32:31.010 --> 32:32.978
WAS ONCE A CUTE LITTLE
BABY MONSTER.

32:33.010 --> 32:34.375
ALVEZ: THE BIGGER ISSUE
FOR ME

32:34.420 --> 32:36.047
IS HOW DOES
A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY

32:36.080 --> 32:38.048
STAY OFF THE RADAR
FOR 20 YEARS?

32:38.090 --> 32:39.648
WHEN GARCIA CAN'T FIND
A BREADCRUMB,

32:39.690 --> 32:41.681
IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE
THE BREAD WAS NEVER BAKED.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.585
ALVEZ: YEAH,
AT SOME POINT, IT'S TIME

32:43.620 --> 32:45.383
TO STOP THINKING ABOUT
WHAT'S POSSIBLE

32:45.430 --> 32:47.227
AND START THINKING
ABOUT WHAT'S LIKELY.

32:47.260 --> 32:49.751
WHICH, FOR ME,
IS THAT LELAND IS DEAD

32:49.800 --> 32:51.995
AND HAS BEEN DEAD
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

32:52.030 --> 32:53.566
JJ: WHICH WOULD LEAVE US WHERE?

32:53.600 --> 32:55.397
WELL, EMILY SAID
THAT PETERS TOLD HER

32:55.440 --> 32:58.568
LELAND HAD OTHER KIDS
HE'D PLAY PIRATES WITH.

33:00.570 --> 33:01.730
RELEASE THE GENIE.

33:01.780 --> 33:03.407
LELAND PETERS--
DID HIS JUVIE TROUBLE

33:03.440 --> 33:05.146
EVER INVOLVE
ANOTHER KID?

33:05.180 --> 33:06.147
UH, YEAH.
A WHOLE GROUP OF KIDS.

33:06.180 --> 33:07.408
THEY RAN IN A PACK.

33:07.450 --> 33:08.747
DOES ONE NAME POP UP
MORE THAN THE OTHERS?

33:08.780 --> 33:11.783
OH. LIKE B-14
IN A BINGO PARLOR.

33:11.820 --> 33:14.687
JESS CARNEY. HE AND LELAND
WERE THICK AS THIEVES.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.553
LITERALLY. STOLE STU FF,
TRUANCY.

33:17.590 --> 33:18.557
BUT THIS IS WEIRD.

33:18.590 --> 33:21.525
AT AGE 14, JESS--POOF--

33:21.560 --> 33:23.653
LIKE DISAPPEARS.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.021
HIS BEHAVIOR TOOK
A VIOLENT TURN

33:26.070 --> 33:28.061
SHORTLY AFTER
THE CANYON FLOODED.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.068
HIS PARENTS COULDN'T
CONTROL HIM ANYMORE.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.601
AND AS SOON AS THE MYSTERY
PRESENTS ITSELF,

33:31.640 --> 33:33.062
THE MYSTERY IS SOLVED.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.737
JESS WAS INSTITUTIONALIZED
OUT OF STATE

33:34.780 --> 33:36.338
AND PUT ON ANTIDEPRESSANTS.

33:36.380 --> 33:38.109
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
THE ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.106
HE WAS MEDICATED
AND ISOLATED

33:40.150 --> 33:41.742
DURING SOME
CRUCIAL FORMATIVE YEARS.

33:41.780 --> 33:45.511
JESS CARNEY RETURNED TO
CALIFORNIA WHEN HE WAS 24

33:45.550 --> 33:47.780
AND WORKED ODD JOBS
IN AND AROUND SAN DIEGO.

33:47.820 --> 33:51.654
AND THEN...SUDDENLY LEI-T
THE AREA ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

33:51.690 --> 33:53.658
THAT'S RIGHT AROUND THE TIME
THE KILLINGS STARTED.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.419
DO WE KNOW WHERE
JESS IS NOW?

33:55.460 --> 33:57.553
OH. OH, WE DO NOT.
AI-TER HE LEI-T SAN DIEGO,

33:57.600 --> 33:58.760
HE--HE--POOF--
VANISHED AGAIN.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.132
IT'S LIKE A RE-POOF,
I GUESS YOU'D CALL IT.

34:01.170 --> 34:02.797
IS THERE A RECENT
PHOTO OF CARNEY?

34:02.840 --> 34:05.604
THE BEST I HAVE
IS A DMV PHOTO
FROM 6 YEARS AGO.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.631
SENDING IT NOW.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.405
IT'S TIME TO GO.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.238
LELAND IS WAITING
FOR US DOWN THERE.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.204
IT'S TIME WE JOIN HIM.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.687
OFFICERS CANVASSED THE CRIME
SCENE NEIGHBORHOODS.

35:00.730 --> 35:02.129
NOBODY'S RECOGNIZED
THE PHOTO.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.889
IT'S 6 YEARS OLD.
JESS CARNEY COULD LOOK

35:03.930 --> 35:05.625
A LOT DIFFERENT NOW.

35:05.670 --> 35:07.490
IT MIGHT NOT HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS,

35:07.530 --> 35:08.895
BUT A 12-YEAR-OLD KID'S
JUST GONE MISSING.

35:08.940 --> 35:09.838
HIS NAME'S TIMMY KANE.

35:09.870 --> 35:11.701
ROSSI: WHEN WAS
HE LAST SEEN?

35:11.740 --> 35:13.162

EMILY,

36:23.780 --> 36:25.771
JESS: YOU DON'T CRY
IF YOU'RE A PIRATE.

36:25.810 --> 36:27.698
REAL PIRATES DON'T CRY.

36:27.750 --> 36:30.446
THERE'S NO CRYING
WHEN YOU'RE A PIRATE!

36:30.480 --> 36:32.744
YOU'VE JUST MADE IT WORSE.
YOU WANT TO CRY?

36:32.790 --> 36:34.781

36:34.820 --> 36:36.708

I CAN SEE THEM!

36:36.760 --> 36:39.558
LET THE BOY GO.

36:39.590 --> 36:41.797
LET HIM GO!

36:41.830 --> 36:44.628
UHH! OH!

36:44.670 --> 36:45.796
OHH...

36:54.810 --> 36:56.971
NO!

37:24.410 --> 37:26.867
YOU'RE OK?

37:31.510 --> 37:33.899
ROSSI: THIS KIND OF THING
WE DON'T SEE ENOUGH OF.

37:33.950 --> 37:36.339
DRINK IT IN.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.416
TIM: I'M SORRY, MOMMY.

37:38.450 --> 37:39.917
CHOPPER FOUND JESS' BOAT

37:39.950 --> 37:42.316
DRIl-TING IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE LAKE, EMPTY.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.659
WAS THERE A CINDER
BLOCK ON BOARD?

37:45.690 --> 37:47.988
NO, SIR. NOTHING.

37:48.030 --> 37:50.692
WE'RE SEARCHING THE
PERIMETER OF THE LAKE NOW

37:50.730 --> 37:52.288
JUST IN CASE HE SWAM
TO THE SHORE

37:52.330 --> 37:53.729
AND MADE A RUN FOR IT.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.499
HE DIDN'T.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.634
JESS WENT BACK TO A PLACE
WHERE YOU'LL NEVER FIND HIM.

37:58.670 --> 38:00.638
IT'S OVER.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.942
CASEY.

38:15.120 --> 38:18.009
WE FOUND THE KILLER.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.925
IT WASN'T YOUR SON.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.552
IT WAS
A FRIEND OF HIS,

38:21.600 --> 38:24.967
A KID HE USED TO PLAY
PIRATES WITH, JESS CARNEY.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.922
DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?

38:28.600 --> 38:31.364
IT WASN'T LELAND?

38:31.410 --> 38:32.638
NO.

38:38.480 --> 38:41.472
HE DIED THAT DAY,
DIDN'T HE?

38:41.520 --> 38:43.943
WHEN THEY FLOODED
THE LAKE.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.414
WE MAY NEVER KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED, BUT, YES,

38:46.450 --> 38:48.657
IT POINTS THAT WAY.

38:48.690 --> 38:50.612
MR. PETERS...

38:59.000 --> 39:01.059
YOU'RE BEING TRANSFERRED
INTO THE CUSTODY

39:01.100 --> 39:04.035
OF AGENT SAMUELSON
OF THE U.S. TREASURY.

39:07.970 --> 39:11.007
I WANTED IT TO BE HIM.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.701
EXCUSE ME?

39:12.750 --> 39:14.877
THE KILLER.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.945
I WANTED IT
TO BE LELAND.

39:16.980 --> 39:20.916
BECAUSE IF IT WAS,
IT MEANT HE WAS ALIVE,

39:20.950 --> 39:23.953
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN ALIVE,

39:23.990 --> 39:27.653
BREATHING THE SAME AIR
I'VE BEEN BREATHING.

39:27.690 --> 39:29.726
IS THAT WRONG?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.730
YOU LOVED YOUR SON.

39:34.770 --> 39:36.465
LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.

39:52.020 --> 39:54.614
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR US,
AGENT ROSSI.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.582
I'M JUST GLAD
THE BOY'S SAFE.

39:58.890 --> 40:01.495
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL LAKE.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.829
YES, IT IS.

40:04.870 --> 40:08.931
I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF
OF THAT NOW AND THEN.

40:08.970 --> 40:10.494

DRIPS DOWN OUR HOUSE *

41:17.140 --> 41:22.077
* FOR THE SOIL TO
