WEBVTT

00:04.439 --> 00:07.920
<i>Previously</i> on Fire Country... JULIO: <i>
We're going to Edgewater?</i>

00:07.964 --> 00:09.618
<i>My lawyer said we'd
be going to a different camp.</i>

00:09.661 --> 00:11.315
<i>This is Three Rock Con Camp.</i>

00:11.359 --> 00:13.970
<i>We fight fires all over
the state of California.</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:15.972
<i>You do what
I tell you, when I tell you,</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:17.582
<i>you'll reduce your sentence
and go home</i>

00:17.626 --> 00:19.062
to your friends
and your family sooner.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.064
<i>We never deal with
what's really going on.</i>

00:21.108 --> 00:22.109
Come on, Eve.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.806
Not everything's
about Riley dying.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.590
Gabs, don't move out here
for me.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.766
I just told you I love you.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.594
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah.

00:29.638 --> 00:30.769
So, what now?

00:30.813 --> 00:32.597
Four years is
a long time to wait

00:32.641 --> 00:34.077
for your real life
to begin.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.296
Yeah, I can relate.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.689
<i>Sharon, he's back.</i>

00:37.733 --> 00:39.169
Manny, give us the room.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.823
Hi, Mom.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.696
Bode.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.351
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:59.929 --> 01:03.585
♪ Happy birthday to you

01:03.628 --> 01:06.588
♪ Happy birthday
to you ♪

01:06.631 --> 01:10.026
♪ Happy birthday, dear Riley

01:10.983 --> 01:15.118
♪ Happy birthday to you

01:16.685 --> 01:19.122
Happy birthday, baby.

01:20.776 --> 01:23.126
So, to you guys.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.782
I'm so lucky to
have you as parents.

01:27.609 --> 01:28.871
And to Eve,

01:28.914 --> 01:31.656
I remember the day
that you moved here.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.831
Ah...

01:32.875 --> 01:34.311
We were like nine years old.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.574
I marched across the street.

01:36.618 --> 01:37.967
And you were like...

01:38.010 --> 01:39.360
"I'm Riley, you want to be
best friends?"

01:39.403 --> 01:41.492
Exactly.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.277
- And you have been.
- Yeah.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.974
Jake,

01:45.017 --> 01:46.280
you know,

01:46.323 --> 01:50.066
Bode never wanted to
share you growing up, but...

01:50.110 --> 01:53.983
over the years you've become
a good friend of mine, too.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.985
- Aw.
- And I'm really grateful.

01:56.899 --> 02:00.120
And to my big brother
Bode, you, uh...

02:00.163 --> 02:02.470
You fought your way through
a really tough year.

02:02.513 --> 02:04.385
With the baseball injury

02:04.428 --> 02:06.735
and all of the mess
that went on with it--

02:06.778 --> 02:08.911
the pills and the rehab.

02:08.954 --> 02:11.957
You fought some demons
and you won.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.224
I love you, big bro.

02:18.790 --> 02:20.140
Love you, too.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.793
Okay. Cake time.

02:24.448 --> 02:26.450
Riley, I...Please just go.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.451
Because I have to go back

02:27.495 --> 02:29.018
over there and act happy

02:29.061 --> 02:30.628
because it's my birthday.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.464
Ri, what's up?

02:40.508 --> 02:42.640
Are you and Jake together?

02:47.471 --> 02:49.081
We were, yeah.

02:50.561 --> 02:52.302
But we're not anymore.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.000
I didn't...

02:55.914 --> 02:58.047
...want to tell you, or anyone,

02:58.090 --> 03:00.919
until it got a little
more serious, but...

03:02.269 --> 03:06.273
Turns out, Jake wasn't
serious at all, so...

03:06.316 --> 03:11.191
Now I am the idiot
crying on her own birthday.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.760
Can you just please
not tell Mom and Dad?

03:15.804 --> 03:17.980
I'm so embarrassed.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.155
<i>Pull over. Let me out now!</i>

03:19.199 --> 03:21.636
Bode!

03:21.679 --> 03:22.637
Riley!

03:23.812 --> 03:25.683
- Hey, stop!
- Are you crazy?!

03:25.727 --> 03:26.684
That's what you told
Riley, isn't it?

03:26.728 --> 03:27.859
After you dumped her.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.296
It's my fault
that she died,

03:29.339 --> 03:30.906
but it's on you that she
died with a broken heart.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.257
He made a mistake.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.913
This... this is
so far beyond a mistake.

03:37.956 --> 03:40.002
Okay? He went to prison,
he's in prison.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.917
No, he is in
the conservation camp now

03:41.960 --> 03:43.788
because of his good conduct.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.400
Yeah, day one here
at fire camp and what?

03:46.443 --> 03:48.140
He...
gone rogue already.

03:48.184 --> 03:50.665
To save a firefighter.
To save Jake.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.493
You want to send him
back to prison for that?

03:52.536 --> 03:54.799
He is unable to follow
basic orders.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.366
Yeah. Okay.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.240
I followed one order
pretty well, didn't I, Dad?

04:03.460 --> 04:06.811
Well, I think I'm all caught up.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.204
Good news is,
whatever happens next

04:08.248 --> 04:09.858
is not up to you,
it's up to me.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.817
He may be your son...
but he's my inmate.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.297
You can't send him back.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.212
Sharon, you just heard
what he said, okay?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.866
It's not your decision.
All due respect, Chief,

04:17.909 --> 04:19.476
I'm in charge of
all my inmates,

04:19.520 --> 04:20.869
including Bode.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.479
I'll collect
the incident reports

04:22.523 --> 04:25.003
from the Buckeye fire,
then I'll make my decision.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.396
Send me to Valley View,

04:26.440 --> 04:29.747
or High Rock,
anywhere but here.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.749
I'm not taking requests, Bode.

04:32.576 --> 04:33.838
There's a process here.

04:34.926 --> 04:38.234
Manny, he's my kid.
That's my boy.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.020
So imagine if it was Gabriela.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.937
Chief... SHARON: No.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.726
He's a liability, Manny.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.336
Having him on a hand crew

04:53.380 --> 04:56.296
puts everybody's
life at risk.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.211
Yours, too.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.998
You heard him.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.478
I'm a liability.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.002
Transfer me.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.178
Look, man.

05:09.221 --> 05:10.962
I can't work
the fire camp program

05:11.006 --> 05:12.790
because the baggage
I have here...

05:13.791 --> 05:14.966
But I want to work it.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.364
Hey.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.844
You headed home?

05:22.887 --> 05:24.628
What was Bode talking about?
What order did he follow?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.064
Hi, Chief.

05:27.718 --> 05:28.676
Not here.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.286
Okay?
Why?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.896
You're worried people are
gonna stare? I don't care.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.637
Yeah, you do.

05:33.681 --> 05:34.899
Fine.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.292
Let's go home.
We'll talk there.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.599
Look, it's been
a long day. I just...

05:38.642 --> 05:40.383
I don't want to make it
any longer for you, okay?

05:40.427 --> 05:44.474
Our marriage has survived
way worse than long days.

05:46.824 --> 05:49.087
We always come out
the other side.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.179
You're really
not gonna tell me?

05:55.398 --> 05:58.358
I'm... just a little worried
about your stress level.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.144
Well...

06:03.232 --> 06:06.409
You should give me a call
when you're ready to talk, then.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.504
Come on.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.468
Hey, Chief.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.472
- Are you two okay?
- What? Oh. Yeah.

06:25.515 --> 06:27.735
- Always.
- Bode's been gone
since Riley died,

06:27.778 --> 06:29.301
and now he comes back?

06:29.345 --> 06:32.174
Where the hell has he
- been all this time?
- Prison.

06:32.217 --> 06:35.220
Before that, he didn't say.

06:35.264 --> 06:37.005
Mm. No surprise there.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.616
Hi, Jake,
how's the, uh, pain?

06:39.660 --> 06:42.010
My foot's fine.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.490
These are damn
solid boots, Chief.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.754
That's good to hear.
I was talking about your shiner.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.452
Look...

06:49.496 --> 06:51.149
Manny is gonna want
an incident report

06:51.193 --> 06:52.629
from both of you guys.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.501
Do not hold back.

06:54.544 --> 06:57.286
He needs to know
if his inmate is dangerous.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.857
Baby.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.336
- Eve.
- Hey, Gabi.

07:04.380 --> 07:07.427
- You guys okay?
- Mm, hey.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.081
Eve saved me out there

07:10.125 --> 07:13.258
at the Buckeye fire.
You should've seen it.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.362
<i>Did you hear Bode's back?</i>

07:30.406 --> 07:31.842
From prison.

07:31.886 --> 07:32.930
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.976
Hi, Bridget.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.195
- Hi.
- I know you were

07:37.239 --> 07:39.110
just about to say that
you're happy for Vince and I

07:39.154 --> 07:40.416
that our son is back,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.636
and that he's thriving
at the fire camp.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.509
Are those scones that I smell?

07:46.553 --> 07:49.251
Fresh out of the oven.
I'm Aydan. I'm new.

07:49.294 --> 07:50.861
Yeah, you're from San Francisco.

07:50.905 --> 07:52.341
And you worked at Chez Panisse.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.951
We're all wondering
what you're doing here.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.649
And there are
rumors you're gonna take

07:55.692 --> 07:57.868
onion rings off the menu.

07:57.912 --> 07:59.304
It's a super gossipy town.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.828
You just got to be able
to deal with that.

08:00.871 --> 08:01.916
I'm Sharon.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.613
Hi.
So...

08:03.657 --> 08:06.355
I got to come to Smokey's now
to run into my own wife?

08:06.398 --> 08:09.663
And that super handsome man
across the room is my husband.

08:09.706 --> 08:10.968
Hi.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.537
Did you, uh, stay
at the hotel last night

08:14.581 --> 08:15.973
or at your sister's?

08:16.017 --> 08:17.584
My sister's doesn't have
room service

08:17.627 --> 08:18.802
and I needed snacks

08:18.846 --> 08:20.543
wondering what
this awful secret is

08:20.587 --> 08:22.153
that you won't tell me.

08:22.197 --> 08:25.766
And stalking our incarcerated
son's records in the system.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.029
He legally changed
his last name

08:28.072 --> 08:29.030
to hide from us.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.597
Did you know that?

08:32.860 --> 08:35.210
You know, I stayed up
all night, too.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.778
You two want
to sit together?

08:37.821 --> 08:38.866
Yes.
No.

08:38.909 --> 08:39.823
Station 42.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.303
Vegetation fire caused by

08:41.346 --> 08:42.826
incoming dry lightning storm.

08:42.870 --> 08:43.827
Highway 101 at Canyon Road.

08:43.871 --> 08:45.133
Vince, there's a...

08:45.176 --> 08:46.264
There's a lightning storm
in Willow Creek.

08:46.308 --> 08:47.483
- Yeah, I heard it.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.006
There's a second
one in Blue Lake.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.094
That means... Yeah, I know
what it means.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.618
I don't know
what it means.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.837
It means calls are gonna be
popping off all day.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.360
Let's go.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.537
Dry storms don't rain water.
They rain lightning.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.017
So it's like
little fires everywhere.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.454
Thank you.
Wait for me.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.852
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

09:08.896 --> 09:10.201
This rec center's in dire need

09:10.245 --> 09:11.681
of defensible space.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.727
We got a dry lightning storm
rolling in, fellas.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.946
So every bit of lightning
that may strike here,

09:15.990 --> 09:19.167
we want to starve, not feast.

09:19.210 --> 09:22.039
Any flammable debris,
we clear it.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.040
Understood?

09:23.084 --> 09:24.389
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Cap.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.956
- Yes, Captain.
- Good.

09:32.006 --> 09:35.226
<i>Now, safety...
safety is your religion.</i>

09:36.097 --> 09:37.402
You practice it,

09:37.446 --> 09:39.274
you shorten your sentence.
No theatrics.

09:39.317 --> 09:42.320
Hey, he's talking about you
going up that mountain

09:42.364 --> 09:44.584
- at the Buckeye.
- Let him.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.716
If lightning
should strike nearby,

09:46.760 --> 09:48.892
I want you to become as small
and as low as possible.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.546
Crouch down to the ground.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
Avoid grasslands
and avoid high areas.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.289
You stop running
all your power tools,

09:54.332 --> 09:56.247
and you drop your manual
tools, all right?

09:56.291 --> 09:59.163
And, Bode...
no freelancing.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.252
I wasn'tplanning on it. Good.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.341
Then we're on the same page.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.780
You know you're gonna
send him packing.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.564
Why wait?

10:08.608 --> 10:11.349
Incident reports aren't in yet.
Plus, I need the manpower.

10:11.393 --> 10:14.265
This lightning storm's
gonna be a doozy.

10:20.532 --> 10:21.795
All right, gentlemen.

10:21.838 --> 10:23.710
We want a four-foot line

10:23.753 --> 10:25.973
with two-foot clearance
on each side.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.452
Let's turn these shrubs
into stumps.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.934
Without fuel, fire won't get
to the structure.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.370
Use your McLeods on the shrubs,

10:32.414 --> 10:35.156
use your Pulaskis
on anything that's thicker.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.505
Yes, Cap.

10:36.548 --> 10:39.247
- Copy that.
- Hey, it's
"Copy that, Cap."

10:39.290 --> 10:41.989
You need to suck up
so he goes easy on you.

10:42.032 --> 10:45.253
Yeah, well,
it's too late.

10:45.296 --> 10:47.298
He doesn't care 'cause
he knows I'm out of here.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.691
Why don't you care?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.214
I do care.

10:51.433 --> 10:54.479
I want to be at fire camp,
just not this one.

10:54.523 --> 10:57.657
You keep saying that,
but this is your home, dude.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.093
There's no place like it.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.485
There's a reason
that's a saying.

11:00.529 --> 11:02.270
Yeah.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.794
Not in a good way for me.

11:04.838 --> 11:07.797
'Cause you're Cal Fire royalty?

11:07.841 --> 11:09.930
His mom's
division chief.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.541
Dad runs a station.
Word's out,

11:12.584 --> 11:14.717
after their visit
to your hospital room.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.719
You're the Fresh Prince
of Edgewater?

11:16.763 --> 11:18.416
You got to work that!

11:18.460 --> 11:20.723
Have Mom
pull some strings

11:20.767 --> 11:22.464
so you can stay.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.249
I would never ask her
to do that,

11:25.293 --> 11:27.208
especially not for something
I don't even want.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.252
You have to.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.341
I heard the food at High Rock

11:30.385 --> 11:32.082
is all suspicious soups
and mystery meat.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.910
Hey, Charlie...

11:33.954 --> 11:36.043
Tell him about
the goulash.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.567
Anyone ever tell you
you're a real close talker?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.917
Come on, man.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.353
I like you.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.225
You're really gonna leave me
here with that dude?

11:44.268 --> 11:46.488
Sorry about that, Freddy.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.411
JAKE [over speaker]:
Lightning expected in the area.

11:56.454 --> 11:57.934
- Head inside.
- I don't get it.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.632
Bode comes back and you don't
want to talk about it.

12:02.373 --> 12:05.115
Imminent lightning storm
in the area.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.726
Seek shelter.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.292
<i>I get why you didn't
tell me after Riley died.</i>

12:08.336 --> 12:10.381
But all the years
since then?

12:10.425 --> 12:12.644
I tell you everything.

12:13.994 --> 12:17.127
We got together a couple of
months before she died.

12:17.171 --> 12:18.912
And Bode said
you broke her heart.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.348
How?

12:21.175 --> 12:22.524
It's complicated.

12:24.352 --> 12:25.788
That's all you're gonna say?

12:29.096 --> 12:32.229
Are you gonna rat out Bode
on the incident report?

12:32.273 --> 12:34.841
For him punching you?

12:36.190 --> 12:37.713
I don't know yet.

12:39.106 --> 12:42.413
Look, I told you.
It's complicated.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.374
You are ruining
dry lightning for me.

12:51.553 --> 12:53.816
Greencrest, 1591.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.470
New incident,
east of the canyon.

12:55.513 --> 12:58.342
Vegetation fire caused
by a lightning strike.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.822
We'll handle with
our unit on scene.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.693
Copy, 15...

13:02.694 --> 13:04.871
Storm's already here.
Let's go.

13:10.224 --> 13:12.356
- Oh, lightning.
- Everyone out of the pool!

13:12.400 --> 13:13.618
- How come?
- Let's go. You're not getting

13:13.662 --> 13:15.403
electrocuted on my watch.
Let's go!

13:15.446 --> 13:16.796
Run towards that building

13:16.839 --> 13:18.014
while I gather the rest
of the campers.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.755
Get a roof over your head.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.235
Let's go!

13:22.410 --> 13:24.368
All right, tools down,
gents, quickly,

13:24.412 --> 13:26.544
unless you want to be
a human lightning rod.

13:26.588 --> 13:27.894
The storm is here,
so keep your heads

13:27.937 --> 13:30.026
on a swivel,
looking for lightning strikes.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.464
Greencrest dispatch,
this is Three Rock Crew Four.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
We're seeing lightning strikes
at the rec center.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.599
We've got summer campers
to corral and shelter.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.557
- Copy, Three Rock Crew Four.
- Let's go.

13:39.601 --> 13:42.691
Move, gentlemen.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.043
- Go, guys, pick up the pace.
- Come on, let's go, boys.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.131
Move it.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.872
Yeah?

13:49.916 --> 13:51.787
- Manny, what's your status?
- Sheltering civvies.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.615
Then rolling out with my crew.

13:56.096 --> 13:57.793
Everybody down!

13:58.620 --> 14:00.448
Down, down, everyone, stay down!

14:00.491 --> 14:02.580
Keep your heads down!

14:02.624 --> 14:03.755
What the hell was that?

14:03.799 --> 14:04.931
Lightning just exploded a tree.

14:04.974 --> 14:06.019
I got to call it in.

14:09.196 --> 14:10.893
Greencrest dispatch.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.982
New incident.
We have a vegetation fire.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.331
Multiple ten-by-ten spots
on the ground.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.811
Start two Type 3 engines,

14:15.855 --> 14:17.421
I'll be assuming
incident command.

14:17.465 --> 14:18.596
Copy, Three Rock.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.294
Game on, fellas!

14:21.034 --> 14:23.210
Everybody stay down!

14:41.881 --> 14:43.621
Freddy. Suit up.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.146
You got to protect that pretty
face for Cookie, right?

14:46.189 --> 14:47.843
Oh, snap.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.714
Manny, I'm sending you

14:49.758 --> 14:51.281
a Type 1 and a water tender,

14:51.325 --> 14:52.848
but this storm is gonna bleed
all my resources dry.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.981
I've got lightning fires
all over the county,

14:55.024 --> 14:56.417
with no signs of stopping.

14:56.460 --> 15:00.073
So shelter the civvies
and keep me posted.

15:00.116 --> 15:01.552
Copy.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.337
All right, gentlemen.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.295
Our job's not done.

15:05.339 --> 15:06.644
Now that we have fire,

15:06.688 --> 15:08.603
we're here until the
civilians are evacuated

15:08.646 --> 15:10.300
or an engine
arrives with water.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.649
But it's raining embers.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.477
- We know that, Freddy.
- Game on, Cap.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.001
Where do you want me?

15:16.002 --> 15:17.307
Division 1501.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.483
Requesting the nearest
Type 1 to the rec center.

15:19.527 --> 15:20.963
Yes, Chief.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.617
We've been in contact with
Three Rock Crew Four.

15:22.660 --> 15:23.966
Working on getting
engines to them.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.142
Yeah, they've got nothing
but hand tools.

15:26.186 --> 15:28.623
They need water or that fire's
gonna get out of control.

15:28.666 --> 15:31.104
Manny, hold tight.

15:31.147 --> 15:32.583
Trying to, Chief,

15:32.627 --> 15:34.672
but Mother Nature keeps
throwing lit matches.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.247
Hit all that vegetation
back there.

15:44.291 --> 15:45.466
Everything wet.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.947
Got it, Chief!

15:49.905 --> 15:52.168
Eve, Jake, keep up the pace.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.866
There's too much slack
in the hose. Watch it.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.390
There wouldn't be slack

15:56.433 --> 15:58.653
if you picked up the pace,
like Chief said.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.350
It's not about
the slack, and you know it.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.656
Yeah, right.

16:01.699 --> 16:02.962
Eve, Jake, you got a fire
behind you.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.095
Fire behind you!

16:06.966 --> 16:09.098
- We got it, Chief.
- Stop the truck.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.057
Stop the truck.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.583
Jake, you want to explain how
you fumbled a mobile attack

16:15.626 --> 16:17.193
when I know I taught you better?

16:17.237 --> 16:18.934
Understood, Chief.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.639
Keep the embers in the black,
where there's no fuel left,

16:28.683 --> 16:30.119
otherwise they could
start more fires.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.775
All right, hey, kids,
right over here.

16:33.818 --> 16:34.994
Keep moving. Come on.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.039
Right in this building.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.910
We're looking for a bus
to take you all home.

16:38.954 --> 16:39.824
But for now,

16:39.868 --> 16:41.087
the safest thing for us to do

16:41.130 --> 16:42.740
is to find a roof
and put it over your head.

16:42.784 --> 16:45.091
All right? Everything
is gonna be just fine.

16:45.134 --> 16:46.831
You guys
are doing great.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.572
There you go,
right in there.

16:48.616 --> 16:50.096
Go, go, go, go, go.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.316
Come on,
- it's gonna be okay. Hey, Dad.
- Gabriela?

16:53.360 --> 16:55.275
What're you
doing here?

16:55.318 --> 16:57.451
I got the swimmers
out of the pool.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.974
No, what are you
doing here today?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.890
Oh, um, teaching diving
to the campers.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.979
I need a job
if I'm gonna live here.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.590
If you're gonna be
out here, you need cover.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.070
Good looking out, thank you.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.246
She's <i>not</i> gonna be out here.

17:10.290 --> 17:11.856
She's gonna be inside.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.945
You're gonna stay safe,
and you're gonna stay inside.

17:13.989 --> 17:14.990
You can't...

17:15.034 --> 17:16.600
Can't outrun lightning.
I know.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.393
You heard the captain.

17:26.436 --> 17:28.134
Everybody inside. Let's go!

17:29.309 --> 17:31.224
I could guess what
you two are fighting about,

17:31.267 --> 17:32.573
but I don't have time to care.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.705
I've already got
one renegade kid.

17:36.707 --> 17:39.667
I need you two to be
the ones I can rely on.

17:41.930 --> 17:43.758
There's a staffing shortage.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.847
A lot of long shifts,
nobody's going home.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.112
So whatever it is,
work it out.

17:50.156 --> 17:53.115
Or you'll do worse damage
than pissing me off.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.077
- Eve, I'm sorry.
- Let's just work.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.998
That's good.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.261
Push it back.

18:08.304 --> 18:11.438
As far from life
and structure as possible.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.267
Without water, it's up to us.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.268
Hey!

18:15.311 --> 18:17.096
Hey, the fire's jumped!

18:18.706 --> 18:20.316
That awning is toast.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.058
Once that fire eats through that
awning and jumps to that roof,

18:23.102 --> 18:24.407
the whole structure
is compromised.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.235
There's kids
in that building.

18:26.279 --> 18:28.194
Yeah, and we got to get them
out of there to safety.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.847
What are we doing, Cap?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.327
We're gonna revisit that
evacuation plan.

18:31.371 --> 18:34.069
We're gonna load the civilians
into the bus with us

18:34.113 --> 18:35.810
and we're all gonna get
the hell out of here.

18:35.853 --> 18:37.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Manny.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.814
We put the kids on the bus,
but not with the inmates.

18:39.857 --> 18:40.902
That's a huge violation, man.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.643
I'm sorry.
It's too dangerous.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.166
Yeah, well, so is fire, man.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.559
And this one is getting
bigger by the second

18:45.602 --> 18:46.821
while we stand around talking.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.953
Manny, I can't
let them comingle.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.346
Well, you got a better idea?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.914
Hey, hey, don't
pack us in there.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.133
Just take the kids.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.569
I said no freelancing,
Bode, all right?

18:55.612 --> 18:57.005
I don't want another
repeat of the Buckeye.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.224
I'm not freelancing, man.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.182
But given my conduct
at the Buckeye,

19:00.226 --> 19:01.705
I'm guessing this is
my last day on your crew.

19:01.749 --> 19:02.706
Okay, the least I can
do with that time

19:02.750 --> 19:04.230
is help save some kids.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.581
Look, permission
to give up my seat.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.193
- I'm asking.
- It's not that simple,
all right?

19:11.237 --> 19:14.240
If Cory's saying that we can't
comingle inmates and kids,

19:14.283 --> 19:16.198
then your one seat is not
gonna solve the problem.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.331
It's got to be all of us
or none of us.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.768
Every man has to decide
for himself.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.118
If my grandkids were in there,

19:23.162 --> 19:25.338
I'd want the firefighters
to save them.

19:25.381 --> 19:26.817
I give up my seat, too.

19:29.429 --> 19:30.517
Damn it, me too.

19:32.127 --> 19:34.129
All right, then.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.176
I'm gonna go tell those campers!

19:37.219 --> 19:39.308
Look around for any
emergency hoses.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.309
Let's go save some kids.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.181
Let's go.

19:45.227 --> 19:46.924
SHARON [over phone]:
How far out are you?

19:46.968 --> 19:49.100
Oh, hello to you, too.

19:49.144 --> 19:52.278
- How far out?
- Uh... 15 minutes.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.845
You want to tell me why
my crew is being rerouted?

19:54.889 --> 19:56.673
You wiped out that brush fire
in record time.

19:56.717 --> 19:57.935
Great work.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.633
So now you're
the closest engine

19:59.676 --> 20:01.417
to the rec center.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.158
Uh-huh.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.942
Where Manny and his crew
happen to be?

20:04.986 --> 20:07.118
That's quite a coincidence.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.598
Aren't you the guy
who was just complaining about

20:08.642 --> 20:09.947
his son not following orders?

20:09.991 --> 20:12.559
You think that could be genetic?

20:12.602 --> 20:14.125
Please hurry.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.998
Love you, too.

20:17.825 --> 20:19.261
Manny, Vince is close.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.786
Uh... didn't you say we were
headed to Manny's crew?

20:22.830 --> 20:24.614
Yeah.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.660
Then why are they headed to us?

20:40.587 --> 20:42.371
Let's move, let's move.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.769
Asphalt's busted
straight through the windshield.

20:49.639 --> 20:50.988
At least one injured party.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.905
The driver. And the rest?

20:59.388 --> 21:00.955
Chief!

21:00.998 --> 21:02.391
The bus wasn't carrying
Manny's crew.

21:02.435 --> 21:03.436
It's full of kids.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.099
Hello?

21:17.188 --> 21:19.365
Hey, buddy,
can you hear me?

21:20.888 --> 21:22.455
Greencrest.
Engine 1591 on scene.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.761
We got one victim trapped
with crush injuries.

21:24.805 --> 21:28.243
Send a Code 3 ambulance
and the nearest truck company.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.984
And, uh...

21:30.027 --> 21:31.638
And a bus to evacuate

21:31.681 --> 21:32.769
about 15 civilians.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.597
He's unconscious.

21:34.641 --> 21:36.251
His pulse is thready.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.905
His pupils...

21:39.254 --> 21:41.343
...are equal and reactive.

21:41.387 --> 21:44.390
And he possibly has internal
bleeding and third-degree burns.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.696
All right, we need
to cool this guy off.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.002
Let's stabilize him.

21:48.742 --> 21:50.134
<i>I need a Lifepak,</i>

21:50.178 --> 21:53.529
C-collar and run a line
wide open on him.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.096
- Here's a jump bag.
- Thank you.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.272
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

21:57.316 --> 21:59.100
I'm Chief Leone.

21:59.143 --> 22:01.363
And me, uh,
and all my firefighter friends,

22:01.407 --> 22:02.930
we're gonna need you guys
to help us out

22:02.973 --> 22:04.584
by getting off this thing
as soon as possible.

22:04.627 --> 22:06.890
Just to be extra safe, in case
there's some danger to the truck

22:06.934 --> 22:08.065
that we can't see.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.066
Okay, let's go. Come on.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.115
Come on.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.551
All right, come on.

22:19.642 --> 22:20.948
Come on.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.084
Hey, buddy.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.390
Coming with us?

22:29.522 --> 22:31.001
I'm scared.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.398
I got you, pal.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.443
Don't worry.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.314
You'll be all right.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.098
You'll be all right. I promise.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.408
All right. Run over there.

22:46.452 --> 22:47.627
And keep them

22:47.670 --> 22:50.064
off the road and low
until the bus gets here.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.153
Jake, I'm handing over
incident command to you.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.982
I got to get to the rec center.
They still need water.

22:55.025 --> 22:56.462
Copy you, Chief.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.686
Permission to pick up
a chainsaw, Cap?

23:03.730 --> 23:05.166
Nah, Bode, I got it.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.298
If we cut down the awning
together, it'll be faster.

23:07.342 --> 23:08.996
It lowers your risk of getting
struck by lightning out here

23:09.039 --> 23:11.128
- in this insanity.
- Yeah, but it increases yours.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.740
I told you--
it's my last day here.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.089
I want to make it count.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.917
The faster we move,
the sooner the whole team

23:16.960 --> 23:18.875
will be out
of harm's way.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.054
Where do you want me, Cap?

23:24.098 --> 23:25.839
All right, Bode,
back-cut that brace.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.586
Watch the kerf! Make sure
not to pinch the bar!

23:38.417 --> 23:39.156
Face cut!

23:44.988 --> 23:46.425
That's it!

23:46.468 --> 23:47.513
Drop the chainsaw.

23:48.035 --> 23:49.906
Pull!

23:53.736 --> 23:54.868
Go!

23:55.956 --> 23:57.305
Let's go!

24:01.440 --> 24:03.485
Not bad
for a hand crew, huh?

24:03.529 --> 24:06.401
I got water! I finally found
an emergency hose

24:06.445 --> 24:08.403
that works!
Gabriela.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.361
I thought you were on the bus
that took off with those kids.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.755
The counselors
- are with the kids.
- You know what?

24:12.799 --> 24:14.191
Cutting line in town--

24:14.235 --> 24:15.236
that's one thing.
But it's dangerous out here.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.368
That's why we bust ass

24:17.412 --> 24:19.066
to keep everybody out here
as safe as possible.

24:19.109 --> 24:21.155
I'm another set
of hands to help.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.113
You would've been
- safe just leaving.
- Dad,

24:23.157 --> 24:24.593
I couldn't leave you.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.683
You want water or not?

24:29.598 --> 24:30.686
Be careful.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.209
Huh?

24:35.996 --> 24:38.564
You're a lifesaver.

24:38.607 --> 24:39.956
Just trying to help out.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.262
Water!

24:43.220 --> 24:45.222
Be careful with the... Kickback!

24:48.443 --> 24:50.184
Yeah.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.281
Okay. Let's see how we're doing.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.065
All right,
he's hypotensive.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.327
Let's lift
the asphalt off

25:03.371 --> 25:04.633
- of him.
- No, we let
the hospital

25:04.677 --> 25:06.374
- remove the asphalt.
- Listen, this thing

25:06.417 --> 25:07.723
- is cooking him from the inside.
- But if he bleeds out

25:07.767 --> 25:09.464
before the ambulance
gets here, it's over.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.292
And if we wait until it
compromises his organs,

25:11.335 --> 25:12.815
he'll die before then.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.643
We need
to get this off

25:14.687 --> 25:15.731
of him now.

25:19.387 --> 25:20.431
Okay.

25:20.475 --> 25:22.782
But we have to avoid
peeling his skin

25:22.825 --> 25:24.958
along with the asphalt.
I'll minimize the damage.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.612
We need
to move together

25:26.655 --> 25:28.527
- on this thing, all right?
- And fast.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.141
<i>These fires keep popping up.</i>

25:34.184 --> 25:36.143
And we keep hitting them.

25:36.186 --> 25:38.493
You play a lot of Whac-A-Mole
as a kid?

25:38.537 --> 25:39.929
Be efficient
with that water.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.148
This hose is hooked up
to a local supply.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.063
There's no telling
when it might run out.

25:46.022 --> 25:48.024
Good, Bode.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.725
You're the reason we have

25:52.768 --> 25:54.596
any water at all.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.989
Yeah.

25:56.032 --> 25:58.034
Want to tell that
to my dad?

25:59.427 --> 26:00.950
He cares about you.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.517
Wants you safe.
You're lucky.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.217
Fire on the roof!

26:07.261 --> 26:09.655
Must've jumped
- when we pulled down the awning.
- We got to keep it

26:09.698 --> 26:11.657
from spreading even more
or else we'll lose control.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.310
Come on, let's hit it.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.016
Greencrest,
Three Rock Crew Four.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.365
We're fighting a structure fire

26:24.408 --> 26:25.845
with a glorified garden hose
over here.

26:25.888 --> 26:28.325
What's the ETA
on those engine crews I ordered?

26:28.369 --> 26:30.545
Okay, we got to do this
in one go.

26:30.589 --> 26:31.851
- Ready?
- No, wait, wait.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.026
- My hands are slipping.
- Look,

26:33.069 --> 26:34.244
- we are out of time.
- No, I...

26:34.288 --> 26:36.812
I can't get a good grip.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.162
And if we're off by
even an inch, he'll bleed out.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.905
Okay, he can't wait.
He's crashing.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.603
Listen, this is
our best shot.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.606
Trust me.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.737
Eve.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.221
All right. Good.
Keep lifting. Go, go.

26:54.264 --> 26:55.309
- All right, how are we looking?
- It's hot.

26:55.352 --> 26:56.615
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.139
Hold on, hold up.
His skin is sticking.

26:59.182 --> 27:00.923
- Pour more saline.
- No, I can't. I have
to keep packing.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.143
Don't stop. You
got this, Jake.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.711
Go.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.321
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.

27:07.364 --> 27:08.670
It's you. It's you.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.284
Okay. Let's get him
on a backboard.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.677
What do you got?

27:15.721 --> 27:16.896
Open chest wound.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.637
He's hypotensive.
Third-degree burns.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.377
Bolus to two liters
in the line.

27:20.421 --> 27:21.814
Okay.

27:24.164 --> 27:25.121
Can't believe
he's alive.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.296
Good work.

27:37.090 --> 27:38.831
Engine's here!

27:38.874 --> 27:40.659
Gentlemen, we did it!

27:40.702 --> 27:44.575
We've been released by the new
incident command, Chief Leone!

27:44.619 --> 27:46.621
Now, let's stay in the game,
but let's give 'em some room!

27:47.361 --> 27:51.017
Three Rock crew, clear out.
Give our hoses access.

27:51.060 --> 27:53.889
Let's throw a ladder up
the alpha side of the building!

27:55.151 --> 27:56.718
Give me 1.5-inch

27:56.762 --> 27:58.198
cross-lay. Let's go!

27:58.241 --> 27:59.939
All right, let's
clear out, everybody.

28:01.157 --> 28:02.202
Every drop helps, right?

28:02.245 --> 28:03.725
Uh, uh, hold the water!

28:03.769 --> 28:05.945
Hold the water!

28:07.076 --> 28:08.251
Bode?

28:08.295 --> 28:10.732
We can't hit it
until you move.

28:10.776 --> 28:12.125
Bode?!

28:13.822 --> 28:15.215
You're not helping.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.001
Get out of the way!

28:19.045 --> 28:21.308
Greencrest, this is Chief Leone
assuming I.C.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.266
We need an additional
Type 1 engine.

28:23.310 --> 28:26.139
Copy, Chief. Rerouting. 10-4.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.243
Bus is here for the kids.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.940
I'm gonna hop on the next
engine to the rec center.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.768
I'm gonna hitch a ride
to the hospital

28:46.812 --> 28:48.509
and see this one through.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.468
I cheated on Riley.

28:51.512 --> 28:54.254
So you played her?

28:54.297 --> 28:57.126
Thanks for telling me.

29:00.303 --> 29:02.871
Look, Riley died before we
could work through our issues.

29:02.915 --> 29:06.570
I couldn't make the same mistake
with you now.

29:19.845 --> 29:22.021
So you two used
to be best friends?

29:22.064 --> 29:23.413
Jake told me.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.501
Your boyfriend?

29:24.545 --> 29:27.809
A lifetime ago, yeah.

29:27.853 --> 29:28.810
Jake.

29:28.854 --> 29:31.334
Welcome to the
party, man.

29:32.422 --> 29:34.598
Gabs!

29:34.642 --> 29:35.599
Oh.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.776
What are you doing here?

29:37.819 --> 29:40.648
Are you trying to scare her
into pulling a gun on you again?

29:40.691 --> 29:42.868
Jake, it's fine.

29:42.911 --> 29:46.393
Baby, you should get checked
for smoke inhalation, okay?

29:47.220 --> 29:49.439
Yeah, I feel a little winded.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.884
You want to punch me again?

30:04.411 --> 30:06.195
Smoke's green.

30:06.239 --> 30:09.068
Hey, Chief! Chief, the fire
must have burned through

30:09.111 --> 30:11.331
the roof, into the storage room
on the ground level.

30:11.374 --> 30:13.072
Green smoke is chemical.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.377
Maybe pool supplies.

30:14.421 --> 30:15.814
Ammonia, chlorine.

30:15.857 --> 30:16.815
Yeah, if those two mix... Building's gonna blow.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.170
If we keep flowing water,

30:24.213 --> 30:25.040
that chlorine will become
hydrochloric acid.

30:25.084 --> 30:26.433
And we'll
all be toast.

30:26.476 --> 30:28.261
Yes, we will. All right.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.524
Hold the water! Hoses down!

30:30.567 --> 30:32.526
Hoses down!

30:32.569 --> 30:36.835
Jake, grab the CO2...CO2 extinguisher. On it.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.951
All right, smoke's
back to gray!

31:05.994 --> 31:07.256
Nice job.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.041
- Way to go!
- Good job, Jake.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.651
Well done, pal.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.958
Thanks, Chief.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.096
Shar?

31:21.140 --> 31:22.576
Tell me you got there in time.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.012
Don't I always?

31:24.056 --> 31:25.318
Vince?

31:25.361 --> 31:28.190
Everyone's safe.
We got it.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.976
Weather report says the
lightning strikes have moved on.

31:31.019 --> 31:32.934
Calls are finally slowing down.

31:32.978 --> 31:36.024
Good to hear.
Love you. See you in a bit.

31:40.463 --> 31:41.551
We're on mop-up, guys.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.597
You see an ember?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.381
Mop it up
with your hand tools.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.862
You know, if we'd have
showed up any later,

31:47.906 --> 31:50.082
we'd have lost this structure.

31:50.125 --> 31:53.085
Great job keeping it standing
as long as you did.

31:53.128 --> 31:55.957
My guys did great work.

31:56.001 --> 31:57.567
Especially Bode.

31:57.611 --> 32:00.092
Oh. So you got Good Bode today.

32:00.135 --> 32:02.746
Good Bode

32:02.790 --> 32:04.400
will lure you in
and break your heart.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.794
Sharon has a hard time

32:06.837 --> 32:09.057
accepting that, I don't.

32:10.624 --> 32:13.061
Yeah, I noticed that.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.850
You make your decision
about him yet?

32:20.982 --> 32:23.115
Been a little busy, Chief.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.603
<i>Well, we kicked its ass again.</i>

32:33.647 --> 32:35.388
That's how we do it, people.
Cheers, everyone!

32:35.431 --> 32:37.172
Yee-hee!

32:40.523 --> 32:41.568
What can I get you?

32:41.611 --> 32:42.830
A beer, please.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.571
Freshest tap you got.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.487
I'm Eve, by the way.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.402
Oh, you're the thumbs-up girl.

32:50.490 --> 32:51.447
I remember you.

32:51.491 --> 32:52.840
Yeah.

32:52.883 --> 32:55.756
Um, I wanted to ask you out.

32:55.799 --> 33:00.108
But I lost my nerve and went
with the thumbs-up instead.

33:00.152 --> 33:03.329
But, um, today at work,

33:03.372 --> 33:05.461
I helped saved this guy's life.

33:05.505 --> 33:08.203
And, uh, it's
kind of a big deal.

33:08.247 --> 33:12.816
So, uh, you want to grab dinner
sometime to celebrate?

33:13.600 --> 33:16.298
I... don't.

33:16.342 --> 33:19.867
You kind of made it about
your weird, near-death,

33:19.910 --> 33:21.521
lifesaving thing.

33:21.564 --> 33:23.044
Maybe

33:23.088 --> 33:26.526
try me again when some guy
didn't almost die on you.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.049
I'm sorry.

33:28.093 --> 33:29.224
No. No.

33:29.268 --> 33:32.706
Please don't apologize
for being honest.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.059
Here's your beer.

33:38.929 --> 33:42.542
♪ And it feels so right

33:42.585 --> 33:44.805
♪ Don't get me wrong...

33:47.416 --> 33:49.070
Ooh!

33:49.114 --> 33:51.290
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay, okay, okay.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.640
<i>You</i> got on the nozzle?

33:53.683 --> 33:56.425
Baby, I <i>found</i> the nozzle.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.427
My dad was so pissed.

33:58.471 --> 34:00.386
You did my job today.

34:00.429 --> 34:02.997
I fought fire today.

34:03.041 --> 34:06.000
- And how'd you like it?
- I loved it.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.220
I can tell.

34:11.266 --> 34:15.314
There's a Cal Fire
recruitment event next weekend.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.620
I think you should check it out.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.927
Really?

34:19.970 --> 34:21.363
Oh.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.104
Look, anything that makes you
light up like this,

34:23.148 --> 34:24.366
hell yeah.

34:24.410 --> 34:26.890
- Really?
- Oh. Ah.

34:26.934 --> 34:28.457
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get us...

34:28.501 --> 34:30.372
I'm gonna buy us a round.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.723
Two beers please.

34:40.991 --> 34:44.386
Does she know? About Riley?

34:46.606 --> 34:48.260
Yeah.

34:48.303 --> 34:51.741
Yeah, she knows.

34:51.785 --> 34:53.569
Look, I'm...
I'm in it with Gabriela.

34:53.613 --> 34:55.571
I tell her everything.

34:55.615 --> 34:57.617
You know what bugs me?

34:57.660 --> 35:00.750
I show you my ugly, my mistakes,

35:00.794 --> 35:02.926
and you keep all
that stuff to yourself.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.059
Makes me feel like
I don't even know you.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.409
Anything that doesn't fit
your Superman persona,

35:07.453 --> 35:09.194
you swallow it up.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.891
I'm working on it.

35:10.934 --> 35:14.155
And-and look at Bode
in his orange jumpsuit.

35:14.199 --> 35:17.680
People see his mistakes
before they see him.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.813
I'm telling Captain Perez
the truth.

35:20.683 --> 35:22.337
Bode punched me.

35:22.381 --> 35:25.775
But Cap will send him
back to prison.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.821
- You know that.
- I can't control that.

35:27.864 --> 35:30.737
I've been lying
for too long.

35:30.780 --> 35:32.260
I'm done.

35:32.304 --> 35:34.654
- It's time to tell the truth.
- He was our best friend.

35:34.697 --> 35:37.439
- And he saved your life, Jake.
- So I should save his ass?

35:37.483 --> 35:38.962
I would if I were you.

35:39.006 --> 35:42.052
If you ever want to get
this family back together.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.158
This booth is for conversation.

36:01.028 --> 36:03.378
Are you ready to converse?

36:04.379 --> 36:06.381
I am.

36:15.347 --> 36:18.001
What was Bode talking about
back at the hospital, Vince?

36:18.045 --> 36:21.048
What order did
he follow well?

36:25.922 --> 36:29.012
After Riley died, I, um...

36:29.056 --> 36:31.363
I told him I didn't want
to see him anymore.

36:33.060 --> 36:34.844
I told him to leave
and never come back.

36:36.933 --> 36:39.240
Oh, my God.

36:42.591 --> 36:44.419
How...?

36:44.463 --> 36:46.160
Our marriage would not
have survived

36:46.204 --> 36:48.031
if he had stayed around, okay?

36:48.075 --> 36:49.555
We... we clawed

36:49.598 --> 36:51.557
our way out of hell
- after the accident.
- Oh, my God.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.123
I've been mourning
that child for years.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.822
We lost two kids
in one night.

36:56.605 --> 36:58.912
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

36:58.955 --> 37:02.350
And now he is back,
and I want to enjoy it.

37:02.394 --> 37:05.571
If you ruin this...
I-I am so serious.

37:05.614 --> 37:07.137
I-I thought that

37:07.181 --> 37:08.922
if he stayed around,
it would just hurt you more.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.576
So... No. No.

37:10.619 --> 37:12.882
You were wrong, you were dead
wrong, and now we have a chance.

37:12.926 --> 37:14.928
Now we have a chance to be
a family again. I am taking it.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.625
And I hope you...
Get out. Get out.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.237
I hope you take it, too.

37:23.153 --> 37:25.286
Um...

37:25.330 --> 37:27.157
there's more.

37:28.289 --> 37:30.857
What the hell else
could there be?

37:32.337 --> 37:34.991
I'm pretty sure
he punched Jake in the face

37:35.035 --> 37:38.299
at the Buckeye, and

37:38.343 --> 37:40.736
if I know Jake,
he's not gonna lie to Manny.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.565
So, there's just...

37:43.609 --> 37:46.742
There's not a chance
in hell he's staying,

37:46.786 --> 37:48.614
and I'm sorry, Shar.

37:48.657 --> 37:51.312
I'm... I'm really sorry.

37:58.493 --> 37:59.799
I will come home tonight.

37:59.842 --> 38:02.758
And I love you, and...

38:02.802 --> 38:08.155
I will find some way
to forgive you for this someday,

38:08.198 --> 38:10.853
but right now,
I have no idea how.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.875
Great job today, Cap.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.661
Thank you, Chief.

38:35.704 --> 38:38.098
Have you made

38:38.141 --> 38:39.578
any decision about my son?

38:40.405 --> 38:43.190
I went through
the incident reports.

38:43.233 --> 38:45.410
He saved Jake Crawford's life.

38:45.453 --> 38:48.282
Using unorthodox methods,
sure, but

38:48.326 --> 38:51.024
Jake's grateful and has
no complaints about Bode.

38:52.721 --> 38:56.377
I knew you were gonna give him
a chance. Thank you, Manny.

38:57.204 --> 38:58.858
I'm gonna transfer him

38:58.901 --> 39:03.166
over to High Rock,
not back to prison.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.168
There's a lot
of good people out there.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.083
And most importantly,
it's far from here.

39:07.127 --> 39:09.259
No, Manny,
I-I can't lose my son.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.000
I understand that, Chief.

39:11.827 --> 39:15.048
But Bode's been very clear.

39:15.091 --> 39:18.225
He doesn't want
to be in Edgewater.

39:19.008 --> 39:21.402
Manny, I'm sick.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.187
What?

39:24.231 --> 39:27.321
I have chronic
kidney disease.

39:27.365 --> 39:31.238
I've told Vince,
but no one else knows.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.982
Being sick didn't really even
bother me a couple of days ago.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.550
I had already lost
both of my kids.

39:38.593 --> 39:41.770
I figured I would just
live out the rest of my days

39:41.814 --> 39:45.383
with a job and a husband
that I loved until my time came.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.260
How's the prognosis?

39:53.303 --> 39:55.915
Uh, it depends on the treatment,

39:55.958 --> 39:58.352
but... it's bad.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.093
There's no promises here, and

40:00.136 --> 40:02.704
I don't really ask for favors,
Manny, and I don't cut corners,

40:02.748 --> 40:04.445
but I need my son.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.795
Okay? I...

40:06.839 --> 40:10.103
I need my family, so...

40:10.146 --> 40:12.410
please, Manny.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.039
I'm almost done.

40:33.082 --> 40:36.259
I'll, uh... I'll be out of here

40:36.303 --> 40:39.306
before everyone else
is back from chow.

40:39.349 --> 40:41.569
You're a pain in
my ass, you know that?

40:43.528 --> 40:46.139
Well, guess I'll be a pain
in someone else's soon.

40:46.182 --> 40:49.316
Incident reports say
you went rogue,

40:49.359 --> 40:51.884
and you saved
a firefighter's life.

40:51.927 --> 40:53.755
The good seems
to outweigh the bad.

40:58.020 --> 41:00.109
I can't be here.

41:00.153 --> 41:02.808
Yeah, so you've said.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.549
And I think

41:04.592 --> 41:08.378
what you want is to be as far
away from your dad as possible.

41:09.205 --> 41:12.513
I saw that today
when he showed up.

41:13.732 --> 41:16.517
There's a lot of hurt
between you two.

41:16.561 --> 41:20.608
But what you really want is
an escape from his voice,

41:20.652 --> 41:23.698
telling you you're
not good enough,

41:23.742 --> 41:27.528
that you don't
deserve to be here.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.530
That voice is inside you, Bode.

41:29.574 --> 41:34.361
And wherever you go-- High Rock,
Valley View, it doesn't matter--

41:34.404 --> 41:37.930
that voice is going
to go with you.

41:37.973 --> 41:41.107
You can't outrun it, man.

41:41.934 --> 41:44.980
I know where you're at...

41:45.024 --> 41:47.374
'cause I've been there, too.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.207
I was an inmate
at this camp, too,

41:54.250 --> 41:56.296
before I was captain.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.907
I stole cars.

41:58.951 --> 42:02.650
And I was really
damn good at it,

42:02.694 --> 42:06.611
till I wrapped one of 'em
around a tree on a bender.

42:06.654 --> 42:09.831
They let you do this job
after that?

42:11.746 --> 42:13.661
Your mom did.

42:13.705 --> 42:16.664
'Cause she believes
in second chances.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.753
So do I.

42:20.233 --> 42:23.410
Man, your fearlessness, your...

42:23.453 --> 42:27.370
your intuition,
your leadership--

42:27.414 --> 42:30.156
I can't teach that.

42:32.071 --> 42:34.073
This program will work

42:34.116 --> 42:36.597
if you work it.

42:39.905 --> 42:42.124
You're staying, Bode.

42:44.126 --> 42:45.911
So it's up to you

42:45.954 --> 42:47.521
to decide

42:47.565 --> 42:50.393
if you're gonna be the deadbeat
your dad thinks you are,

42:50.437 --> 42:52.395
or if you're gonna be the man

42:52.439 --> 42:54.702
your mom and I both know
you can be.
