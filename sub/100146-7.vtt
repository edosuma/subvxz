THIS CABIN WAS IN
YOUR FATHER’S FAMILY
FOR GENERATIONS,

01:33.890 --> 01:36.630
AND IT’S YOUR FATHER’S
FAVORITE PLACE TO HIDE.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.560
HE’S IGNORING MY
CALLS AND TEXTS.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.230
THE ONLY WAY TO
MAKE SURE IS
TO SHOW UP.

01:41.230 --> 01:47.500
SO, LET’S GO.
TIME TO ROLL.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.800
HEY. SORRY.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.170
DARNELL, HEY.

01:50.170 --> 01:52.210
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE.

01:52.210 --> 01:55.010
I WAS HOPING
TO CATCH YOU.

01:55.010 --> 01:56.710
IF IT’S OK, UM,

01:56.710 --> 01:58.580
COULD YOU GIVE THIS
TO COREY FOR ME?

01:58.580 --> 02:00.420
HE HASN’T BEEN RESPONDING
TO MY TEXTS OR CALLS.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.620
YOU CAN GIVE HIM
THAT LETTER YOURSELF.

02:08.620 --> 02:09.790
YOU’RE FAMILY
TO COREY.

02:09.790 --> 02:10.890
THIS IS
A FAMILY TRIP.

02:10.890 --> 02:12.060
YOU SHOULD COME.

02:12.060 --> 02:13.460
ARE--ARE YOU SURE?

02:23.570 --> 02:24.510
YOU HEARD HER.

02:25.670 --> 02:27.440
LET’S GO FIND COREY.

02:40.690 --> 02:44.430
DR. GIBBS: LOVE GUARDS
THE HEART FROM THE ABYSS.

02:44.430 --> 02:46.260
THAT’S MOZART.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.160
AND THE LOVE YOU ALL HAVE
FOR EACH OTHER

02:48.160 --> 02:51.670
IS WHY YOU’RE COMMITTED TO
MAKING THIS FAMILY WHOLE AGAIN.

02:51.670 --> 02:54.470
STEP ONE,
HEALING AS A UNIT.

02:54.470 --> 02:56.270
AND HOW MANY
STEPS ARE THERE?

02:56.270 --> 02:58.140
THIS ISN’T AA.

02:58.140 --> 03:00.110
THERE’S NOT A FINISH LINE
WE CAN JUST SKIP AHEAD TO.

03:00.110 --> 03:02.640
OLIVIA’S RIGHT.
THE HEALING TIME

03:02.640 --> 03:05.210
IS DIFFERENT FOR
EVERY FAMILY.

03:05.210 --> 03:06.550
WE’RE ALL-IN,

03:06.550 --> 03:09.080
FOR REBUILDING
THIS FAMILY.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.420
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.350
DR. GIBBS: LAURA,
YOU’VE BEEN QUIET.

03:12.350 --> 03:13.420
IS HE RIGHT?

03:13.420 --> 03:14.790
ARE YOU ALL IN?

03:14.790 --> 03:18.190
UH...I’M HERE.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.200
THAT’S ALL I HAVE
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.490
WOW. THIS IS DAD’S?

03:44.490 --> 03:46.120
GRACE: YEAH.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.820
IT WAS BUILT BY HIS
GREAT-GRANDFATHER.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.190
THAT’S WHY THEY SAY
DON’T SELL
GRANDMA’S HOUSE.

03:50.190 --> 03:51.630
WHAT Y’ALL
DOING HERE?

03:54.730 --> 03:56.800
WE CAME TO BRING
YOU HOME.

04:05.610 --> 04:09.440
OLIVIA: HONESTLY...
I MISS MY FAMILY

04:09.440 --> 04:12.280
AND I’M HOPING THERAPY CAN

04:12.280 --> 04:15.680
HELP US GET BACK
TO A HEALTHY PLACE.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.020
HELPED ME IN THE PAST, SO...

04:18.620 --> 04:22.720
UM...WHEN MY FAMILY
LOOKS AT ME NOW,

04:22.720 --> 04:25.630
I, UH, I CAN FEEL
THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT.

04:25.630 --> 04:28.100
I DESERVE IT
AND I KNOW THAT.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.600
I GUESS I’M
HOPING THAT

04:30.600 --> 04:33.400
ONE DAY SOON,
THEY’LL BE ABLE TO

04:33.400 --> 04:35.070
LOOK AT ME LIKE
THEY USED TO

04:35.070 --> 04:37.140
AND WE CAN START
FINDING OUR WAY

04:37.140 --> 04:38.670
BACK TO HAPPINESS.

04:38.670 --> 04:40.410
JORDAN: EXCEPT
I DON’T KNOW THAT

04:40.410 --> 04:43.180
BEING HAPPY TRANSLATES
TO YOU AND MOM

04:43.180 --> 04:44.080
STAYING TOGETHER.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.380
MAYBE IT MEANS YOU DON’T.

04:45.380 --> 04:48.120
JORDAN. WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOU?

04:48.120 --> 04:50.750
DR. GIBBS: BRUTAL HONESTY
IS HARD TO HEAR,

04:50.750 --> 04:53.820
BUT IT’S WHAT MAKES
FAMILY THERAPY SO EFFECTIVE.

04:53.820 --> 04:59.230
JORDAN’S FEELINGS
HAVE VALUE HERE. JORDAN?

04:59.230 --> 05:00.730
I LOVE YOU BOTH, OK?

05:00.730 --> 05:03.600
BUT MOM CRIES IN
THE SHOWER AT NIGHT,

05:03.600 --> 05:06.600
EVEN WHEN SHE THINKS
THAT WE CAN’T HEAR HER.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.040
AND DAD?

05:08.040 --> 05:09.640
YOU CAN’T LET GO
OF YOUR GUILT.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.710
FROM WHERE I’M SITTING,
YOU BOTH LOOK TERRIBLE.

05:12.710 --> 05:14.140
BEING AROUND EACH OTHER
ISN’T HELPING

05:14.140 --> 05:16.280
EITHER ONE OF YOU.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.610
DR. GIBBS: THANK YOU
FOR SHARING, JORDAN.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.980
I GUESS IT’S MY TURN.

05:24.050 --> 05:27.160
I AM TIRED OF
LIVING MY LIFE ON HOLD

05:27.160 --> 05:29.360
AND AS SOON AS
THIS THERAPY

05:29.360 --> 05:32.060
OR WHATEVER
IS OVER,

05:32.060 --> 05:33.360
I WOULD LIKE
ALL OF US

05:33.360 --> 05:35.700
TO BE ABLE
TO MOVE ON.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.230
WITH OR WITHOUT ME?

05:39.200 --> 05:40.170
I DON’T KNOW.

05:42.940 --> 05:44.140
COREY: I’M NOT GOING.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.040
YOU’RE NOT EVEN
LISTENING, MAN.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.310
SO, HOW’D Y’ALL
FIGURE OUT

05:49.310 --> 05:50.780
I WAS SICK, ANYWAY?

05:50.780 --> 05:52.310
GRACE: TURNS OUT
SPENCER, DILLON,
AND DARNELL

05:52.310 --> 05:54.620
CAN GIVE THE HARDY BOYS
A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

05:56.750 --> 05:57.890
SO, HOW LONG YOU GOT?

05:59.250 --> 06:00.660
DARNELL, CHILL, MAN.

06:00.660 --> 06:03.020
WHY? Y’ALL
THINKING IT, TOO.

06:03.020 --> 06:04.730
YOU’RE JUST TOO
SCARED TO ASK.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.600
-WHAT ABOUT CHEMO?
-THERE’S NO

06:15.600 --> 06:17.040
TREATING IT THIS TIME.

06:17.040 --> 06:18.270
SPENCER: OK, LOOK.

06:18.270 --> 06:19.270
WE GET THAT YOU THOUGHT

06:19.270 --> 06:20.640
LEAVING US IN THE DARK

06:20.640 --> 06:22.040
WOULD SPARE US THE PAIN
OF WATCHING YOU--

06:24.750 --> 06:26.680
THE POINT IS,
WE KNOW NOW.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.880
SO, YOU CAN STOP TRYING
TO PLAY THE EMOTIONAL HERO

06:28.880 --> 06:30.050
AND COME HOME
WITH US.

06:30.050 --> 06:32.190
SON, THIS IS
MY LIFE,

06:32.190 --> 06:33.860
MY CHOICE.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.620
SO, TO HELL WITH
THE REST OF US.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.690
I DON’T WANT OUR
FINAL MEMORIES TOGETHER

06:37.690 --> 06:38.860
TO BE OF ME DYING.

06:38.860 --> 06:40.560
I DON’T WANT OUR
LAST MEMORIES TO BE OF YOU

06:40.560 --> 06:41.700
DRIVING OFF
WITH NO GOOD-BYE.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.030
SO, I GUESS
WE AT AN IMPASSE.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.200
DILLON: YO! YOU GUYS

06:45.200 --> 06:46.570
GOTTA CHECK OUT
THE BACK.

06:46.570 --> 06:47.600
THOSE WOODS GO DEEP.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.170
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
GO PICK A ROOM.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.640
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:52.640 --> 06:53.810
IT WAS A LONG DRIVE.

06:53.810 --> 06:56.140
YOU DON’T WANT TO LEAVE,
WE’LL STAY.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.610
SEE IF WE CAN GET
THROUGH THAT HARD HEAD
OF YOURS

06:58.610 --> 06:59.680
BY THE END OF
THE WEEKEND.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.530
GRACE: BABY, IF HE SAYS
THERE’S NO TREATMENT,

07:14.530 --> 07:15.730
WE SHOULD LISTEN.

07:15.730 --> 07:16.870
TO WHAT?

07:16.870 --> 07:18.600
HE’S JUST GONNA IGNORE US
THE WHOLE TIME WE’RE HERE?

07:18.600 --> 07:22.540
YO! NOW, THIS IS SOME
OLD-SCHOOL STUFF.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.170
HEY, DOES ANYBODY EVEN
USE THESE ANYMORE?

07:25.170 --> 07:26.410
GRACE: HA HA.
VERY FUNNY.

07:26.410 --> 07:27.640
GRACE: PUT THAT BACK.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.610
OK. EVERYBODY SAY CHEESE!

07:30.610 --> 07:32.080
ALL: CHEESE.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.210
NICE. HEY,
TAKE ONE OF ME.

07:34.210 --> 07:36.120
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME
SOMETHING GOOFY, THOUGH.

07:40.820 --> 07:43.060
DARNELL: OH.

07:43.060 --> 07:46.130
HEY, SORRY.
WE WERE JUST
FOOLING AROUND.

07:46.130 --> 07:48.500
SO, NOW YOU APOLOGIZING
FOR BEING HAPPY?

07:48.500 --> 07:50.200
I’M GONNA TAKE A WALK.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.730
DILLON: HEY, DAD,
CAN WE USE THIS CAMERA

07:51.730 --> 07:53.200
WHEN WE GO
CAMPING LATER?

07:53.200 --> 07:54.170
NOBODY GOING
CAMPING, DILLON.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.470
ALL RIGHT?
PUT IT BACK.

07:55.470 --> 07:57.070
TAKE YOUR WALK, COREY.

07:57.070 --> 07:58.770
THE BOYS AND I WILL
LEND A HAND PACKING UP.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.170
RIGHT, BOYS?

08:00.170 --> 08:02.080
SPENCER: YES, MA’AM.
DARNELL: FOR SURE.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.680
DILLON: DAD, WHY ARE YOU EVEN
PACKING IN THE FIRST PLACE?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.250
DIDN’T YOU JUST GET HERE?

08:07.380 --> 08:10.350
DILLON, JUST DO AS
MOM SAYS, ALL RIGHT?
LET POPS REST.

08:10.350 --> 08:12.120
DARNELL: D, WHY DON’T
YOU GRAB THIS BOX

08:12.120 --> 08:13.950
AND LET’S GET STARTED
IN THE BACK.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.160
SEE? THAT’S EXACTLY

08:18.160 --> 08:19.290
WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO AVOID.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.360
I DON’T WANT ANYONE’S
DAMN PITY.

08:22.430 --> 08:24.130
LAURA: HOW IS THAT HELPFUL?

08:24.130 --> 08:27.470
WELL RECALLING YOUR
FONDEST FAMILY MEMORIES

08:27.470 --> 08:29.200
REMINDS EVERYONE
OF WHAT

08:29.200 --> 08:31.170
BETTER DAYS FELT LIKE.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.610
ORLANDO.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.780
WE WERE VISITING DAD
DURING A BYE WEEK.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.710
WIZARDING WORLD OF
HARRY POTTER, YEAH.

08:37.710 --> 08:40.050
I’D FORGOTTEN
ABOUT THAT TRIP.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.450
I DIDN’T, BECAUSE JORDAN

08:42.450 --> 08:44.550
LOST BOTH OF OUR WANDS.

08:44.550 --> 08:45.790
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.760
THEY WERE--THEY WERE
MAGIC’ED AWAY.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.720
LAURA: THEY FELL
THROUGH THE DRAINAGE GRATE

08:49.720 --> 08:52.260
BECAUSE YOU STUMBLED AROUND
FOR AN HOUR

08:52.260 --> 08:55.430
THINKING YOU WERE DRUNK
AFTER YOU HAD BUTTERBEER.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.700
JORDAN: HEY, WHOA,
AT LEAST

08:56.700 --> 08:58.270
I DIDN’T PUKE
ALL OVER MYSELF

08:58.270 --> 09:00.170
ON THE FORBIDDEN JOURNEY.

09:00.170 --> 09:03.070
LAURA: YOU ACTED LIKE IT WAS
TOTALLY NORMAL.

09:03.070 --> 09:04.610
DR. GIBBS: BILLY,
WHAT DO YOU RECALL?

09:04.610 --> 09:07.670
NOTHING, BECAUSE
HE WASN’T THERE.

09:07.670 --> 09:09.310
NO, I HAD--I HAD
TO WORK.

09:09.310 --> 09:11.050
LAURA: YOU HAD THE DAY OFF

09:11.050 --> 09:13.180
BUT YOU JUST STAY BEHIND

09:13.180 --> 09:15.050
AND STUDY YOUR PLAYS.

09:15.050 --> 09:17.050
BILLY: LOOK, THE PRESSURES
OF BEING IN THE NFL

09:17.050 --> 09:20.150
WERE BOTH MENTAL
AS WELL AS PHYSICAL.

09:20.150 --> 09:24.360
THAT’S WHY I STAYED
BEHIND AND--AND STUDIED.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.090
SO, MOM’S RIGHT.

09:26.090 --> 09:27.690
FOOTBALL WAS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY?

09:27.690 --> 09:31.270
NO. NO.
I WAS WORKING
FOR THE FAMILY.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.130
YOU THREE WERE
ALWAYS A PRIORITY.

09:33.130 --> 09:34.170
REALLY?

09:34.170 --> 09:35.770
EVEN WHEN YOU CHEATED?

09:35.770 --> 09:37.170
DR. GIBBS: LAURA’S SAYING--
LAURA: I DON’T NEED

09:37.170 --> 09:38.440
A DAMN TRANSLATOR.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.070
WHY AM I BEING SINGLED
OUT AND ATTACKED?

09:40.070 --> 09:42.080
BECAUSE YOU’RE THE REASON
WE’RE ALL HERE.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.440
DR. GIBBS: ALL RIGHT,
I THINK NOW

09:43.440 --> 09:45.550
WOULD BE A GOOD TIME
FOR A BREAK.

09:45.550 --> 09:47.210
BILLY, LAURA,
CAN I HAVE A WORD?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.450
BRUH, WE REALLY GONNA
SPEND THIS WHOLE WEEKEND

09:52.450 --> 09:54.150
TIPTOEING AROUND
EACH OTHER IN SILENCE?

09:54.150 --> 09:56.790
JUST FOCUS ON
YOUR PACKING, MAN.

09:56.790 --> 09:58.120
ARE YOU REGRETTING
INVITING ME ALONG?

09:58.120 --> 10:00.530
I DIDN’T INVITE YOU.
MY MOMS DID.

10:01.460 --> 10:03.960
OK. SO, THAT’S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.470
LEAVE IT ALONE, A’IGHT?

10:48.510 --> 10:50.540
I CAME OUT HERE
TO BE ALONE, MAN.

10:52.980 --> 10:56.120
LOOK, MAN...
I GET IT.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.020
YOU’RE ANGRY
AT HIM.
YOU RESENT ME.

11:01.020 --> 11:02.190
ARE YOU HARD OF
HEARING OR WHAT?

11:02.190 --> 11:03.620
CLEARLY, THERE’S
THINGS YOU NEED TO

11:03.620 --> 11:05.490
GET OFF YOUR CHEST,
BUT YOU CAN’T

11:05.490 --> 11:06.990
SAY IT TO COREY ’CAUSE OF
EVERYTHING HE’S
DEALING WITH.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.800
SO, JUST
SAY IT TO ME.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.600
SPENCER, TRUST ME.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.830
IF YOU DON’T
GET THIS OUT NOW,

11:13.830 --> 11:14.970
YOU’RE NOT GONNA BE
ABLE TO ENJOY

11:14.970 --> 11:16.570
THIS WEEKEND WITH
YOUR POPS.

11:16.570 --> 11:18.770
WHO KNOW HOW MANY OF
THESE YOU GOT LEFT?

11:21.780 --> 11:23.110
A’IGHT, MAN.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.080
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
GROWING UP WITH HIM?

11:34.020 --> 11:37.560
MAN: ♪ ... YOUR EYES,
YOU SAID ♪

11:42.660 --> 11:44.930
IT WAS, UH, STABLE.

11:46.970 --> 11:47.930
AND FUN.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.070
AND DEFINITELY
FRUSTRATING.

11:51.070 --> 11:52.270
HOW SO?

11:52.270 --> 11:54.910
COREY HAD A VERY
ROUNDABOUT WAY

11:54.910 --> 11:56.980
OF TEACHING TOUGH
LIFE LESSONS.

11:57.980 --> 12:00.010
THIS ONE TIME, RIGHT,

12:00.010 --> 12:01.980
COREY TOOK ME
FISHING.

12:01.980 --> 12:03.480
IT WAS A HOT MESS.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.950
PATIENCE AIN’T REALLY
MY THING.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.920
SO, I KEPT TRYING TO
THROW STUFF IN THE WATER

12:07.920 --> 12:09.990
SO THE FISH COULD
SHOW UP SOONER.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.920
AND HE’D
GET SO MAD.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.860
POKE ME IN MY CHEST
AND SAY...

12:14.860 --> 12:16.000
"YOU WANNA BE
THAT BROTHER

12:16.000 --> 12:18.970
KNOWN FOR TAKING
SHORTCUTS IN LIFE? HUH?"

12:18.970 --> 12:23.040
AND HOW FISHING WAS
ABOUT THE LONG HAUL,

12:23.040 --> 12:25.910
PRACTICING PATIENCE,

12:25.910 --> 12:29.240
LEARNING HOW TO BE
AT PEACE WITH
THE STILLNESS,

12:29.240 --> 12:32.380
THE SILENCE.

12:32.380 --> 12:35.010
TOOK ME MONTHS
TO REALIZE THAT

12:35.010 --> 12:36.850
HE WASN’T JUST
TALKING ABOUT FISHING.

12:42.120 --> 12:46.290
I AIN’T NEVER
BEEN FISHING.

12:46.290 --> 12:48.030
WASN’T NOBODY
TO EVER TAKE ME.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.100
YOU KNOW, I WATCHED
HOW YOU HANDLED YOURSELF.

12:58.100 --> 13:01.010
IN THAT 7-ON-7 GAME
AGAINST SOUTH CRENSHAW.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.380
AND ALL THAT NONSENSE
WITH CLIFF.

13:05.380 --> 13:08.450
THAT MOMENT I REALIZED

13:08.450 --> 13:10.820
HOW JUST LIKE
COREY YOU ARE.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.390
YOU MAY NOT HAVE
GROWN UP WITH HIM, BRUH,

13:15.390 --> 13:17.520
BUT YOU DEFINITELY

13:17.520 --> 13:18.960
GOT THE BEST OF HIM
IN YOU.

13:20.090 --> 13:22.360
MAN: ♪ AS WE ARE ♪

13:25.930 --> 13:30.470
♪ FRAGILE AS WE ARE ♪

13:30.470 --> 13:31.900
I’M SCARED, MAN.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.540
I CAN’T LOSE HIM.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.380
TALK TO HIM.
GOTTA TELL HIM.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.950
YOU AND COREY AVOIDING
Y’ALL’S ISSUES ALL WEEKEND

13:40.950 --> 13:42.420
AIN’T GONNA DO EITHER OF
Y’ALL NO GOOD.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.620
JORDAN: I CAN’T BELIEVE
SHE GAVE US HOMEWORK.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.990
YOU HAPPY NOW?

13:50.990 --> 13:52.490
OLIVIA: I’M ALL FOR
UNCONVENTIONAL METHODS

13:52.490 --> 13:54.030
IF IT GETS
THE JOB DONE.

13:54.030 --> 13:57.060
THAT WOMAN IS GETTING
PAID $200 AN HOUR, OK,

13:57.060 --> 13:58.930
AND THE BEST THING
SHE CAN COME UP WITH

13:58.930 --> 14:00.270
WAS TO MAKE US DRAW
STUPID PICTURES

14:00.270 --> 14:01.970
OF WHAT OUR FAMILY
ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE

14:01.970 --> 14:02.870
VERSUS WHAT OUR
FAMILY FEELS LIKE?

14:02.870 --> 14:04.970
WHAT DO YOU CARE?
IT’S NOT YOUR MONEY.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.870
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I SAY

14:06.870 --> 14:08.070
WE GO "LORD OF THE FLIES"
WITH NO PARENTS.

14:08.070 --> 14:10.310
LESS PEOPLE TO DRAW,
NO CURFEWS, RIGHT?

14:12.180 --> 14:14.310
YOU DO REALIZE
YOU’RE ABOUT
TO HAVE A KID

14:14.310 --> 14:15.880
WITH A GIRL
YOU BARELY KNOW.

14:15.880 --> 14:18.920
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE
THIS MORE SERIOUSLY.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.730
YOU’RE JUST
IN TIME, SPENCER.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.760
LOOK AT THIS.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.670
YOU COOL WITH US
STICKING AROUND NOW?

14:36.100 --> 14:37.540
THE WALK
CLEARED MY HEAD.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.840
IF THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR LAST WEEKEND

14:40.840 --> 14:42.240
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY,

14:42.240 --> 14:45.680
Y’ALL ARE RIGHT,
LET’S MAKE IT COUNT.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.880
BUT YOU’RE STILL NOT
COMING HOME WITH US.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.180
NO, SON.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.690
AHA! OH!

14:55.690 --> 14:57.220
I CAN’T BELIEVE
I EVER FIT

14:57.220 --> 14:58.590
IN THIS TINY THING.

14:58.590 --> 15:01.630
MAN. MEMORIES.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.570
HERE. YOURS TO KEEP.

15:07.570 --> 15:09.230
NO, THANKS.
I’M GOOD.

15:09.230 --> 15:11.700
COME ON.
TAKE IT.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.570
SPENCER, I’D REALLY
LIKE YOU TO HAVE IT.

15:13.570 --> 15:14.640
I DON’T WANT NO
DAMN JERSEY

15:14.640 --> 15:16.040
TO REMEMBER YOU
BY, MAN.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.080
I WANT YOU!

15:18.080 --> 15:19.980
I’M SORRY. I--
I DIDN’T MEAN IT.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.150
YES, YOU DID.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.080
AND IT’S FINALLY
THE FIRST HONEST THING

15:25.080 --> 15:27.620
THAT YOU SAID TO ME
SINCE YOU GOT HERE.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.490
DON’T STOP NOW.
LET IT OUT.

15:32.720 --> 15:34.630
I HATE THAT YOUR
FIRST INSTINCT

15:34.630 --> 15:36.660
WHEN THINGS GET BAD
IS TO RUN.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.200
YOU KNOW HOW
MESSED UP IT IS

15:40.200 --> 15:42.170
THAT WE DRIVE ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO GET YOU

15:42.170 --> 15:44.200
AND THE FIRST WORDS
OUT YOUR MOUTH

15:44.200 --> 15:45.800
IS STILL NO THANKS?

15:45.800 --> 15:47.710
HOW DAMN SELFISH
ARE YOU, MAN?

15:47.710 --> 15:49.070
THIS AIN’T JUST
HAPPENING TO YOU.

15:49.070 --> 15:50.180
COREY: SON--
SPENCER: YOU WANT TO KNOW

15:50.180 --> 15:51.210
HOW I’M FEELING?
ALL RIGHT.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.080
I’M ANGRY.
YOU HEAR ME?

15:53.080 --> 15:56.620
I’M ANGRY.
I’M ANGRY!

15:56.620 --> 15:58.280
I’M ANGRY THAT
YOU’RE DYING

15:58.280 --> 16:01.020
AND THERE AIN’T
NOTHING I CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

16:01.020 --> 16:04.020
YOU ALWAYS
LEAVING US, MAN.

16:06.990 --> 16:08.130
LEAVING ME.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.530
AND THIS TIME, IT’S
GONNA BE FOR GOOD.

16:15.170 --> 16:17.500
WHAT THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THAT?

16:39.560 --> 16:40.730
EVERYTHING OK?

16:40.730 --> 16:42.160
YEAH.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.030
WHAT ABOUT THOSE
RAISED VOICES I HEARD?

16:44.030 --> 16:45.300
SPENCER ARE I
WERE JUST SAYING

16:45.300 --> 16:47.130
SOME THINGS THAT
NEEDED TO BE SAID.

16:48.330 --> 16:49.670
MM-HMM.

16:55.670 --> 16:56.880
I’M SORRY, GRACE.

17:00.610 --> 17:03.550
YOU WANT TO BE
MORE SPECIFIC

17:03.550 --> 17:04.950
ABOUT WHAT FOR?

17:04.950 --> 17:06.750
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR MY ROLE

17:06.750 --> 17:09.550
IN ENDING OUR MARRIAGE.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.660
I CHEAT ON YOU

17:11.660 --> 17:13.630
AND YOU’RE THE ONE
WITH THE APOLOGY?

17:13.630 --> 17:15.730
YOU DIDN’T CHEAT
IN A VACUUM.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.060
I ABANDONED OUR MARRIAGE
LONG BEFORE

17:18.060 --> 17:19.770
I PHYSICALLY
WALKED OUT.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.810
YOU NEVER ASKED
THE DETAILS

17:27.810 --> 17:29.040
OF THE AFFAIR.

17:29.040 --> 17:33.610
MAYBE...GETTING OUT
THE FULL TRUTH

17:33.610 --> 17:35.010
ABOUT THAT NIGHT

17:35.010 --> 17:38.550
WILL HELP US LET IT GO
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

17:39.150 --> 17:40.280
BILLY: ARE YOU SURE?

17:40.280 --> 17:41.790
LAURA: NO, I’M NOT SURE

17:41.790 --> 17:44.490
I WANT TO HEAR THE DETAILS
OF YOUR AFFAIR.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.260
BUT I NEED TO.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.730
I MEAN, CAN IT
BE WORSE THAN

17:52.730 --> 17:54.570
THIS SORDID LOOP
THAT I KEEP

17:54.570 --> 17:56.370
PLAYING INSIDE OF
MY HEAD?

17:56.370 --> 17:58.240
BUT WHAT IF IT IS?

17:58.240 --> 18:00.240
REALLY?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.670
WORSE THAN ASKING
MYSELF ON REPEAT,

18:02.670 --> 18:04.380
DID HE FALL
IN LOVE AGAIN

18:04.380 --> 18:06.240
OR WHAT IF
IT WAS WORSE

18:06.240 --> 18:08.280
AND HE NEVER FELL
OUT OF LOVE?

18:09.780 --> 18:12.520
WITHOUT LAURA
GETTING THESE ANSWERS,

18:12.520 --> 18:14.190
IT’LL BE IMPOSSIBLE

18:14.190 --> 18:16.620
FOR YOU BOTH TO
EMOTIONALLY REATTACH.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.160
GRACE: IT HAD BEEN 3 WEEKS.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.230
I WAS REALLY MISSING YOU.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.900
THEN YOU CALLED AND SAID

18:26.900 --> 18:28.600
YOU WEREN’T COMING HOME,

18:28.600 --> 18:30.300
THAT YOU WERE
GONNA HANG BACK

18:30.300 --> 18:31.840
AND NETWORK WITH
THE OTHER COACHES.

18:34.910 --> 18:36.170
IN THAT MOMENT...

18:36.170 --> 18:38.180
I FELT LIKE
I WASN’T ENOUGH.

18:38.180 --> 18:40.210
I DON’T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND.

18:40.210 --> 18:45.180
I...SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE

18:45.180 --> 18:47.720
TRAINING TO BE
A PROFESSIONAL
FOOTBALL PLAYER.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.190
AND I DID IT.
I WAS IN STADIUMS,

18:51.190 --> 18:53.090
LIVING OUT MY DREAM.

18:55.330 --> 18:58.200
AND JUST LIKE THAT,

18:58.200 --> 19:01.300
I BUSTED MY KNEE
AND IT WAS OVER.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.530
THE CLOCK HAD
STOPPED RUNNING.

19:03.530 --> 19:05.100
BUT I WAS ADAMANT.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.470
I HAD TO KEEP
THAT CLOCK GOING.

19:07.470 --> 19:09.770
ALL RIGHT?
I WAS TRYING
TO WILL MY KNEE

19:09.770 --> 19:11.210
BACK INTO PLAYING SHAPE,

19:11.210 --> 19:12.680
BUT EVERY TIME I FAILED...

19:14.980 --> 19:16.680
I FELT LIKE I WAS
FAILING YOU,

19:16.680 --> 19:19.220
LIKE I WAS FAILING
MY FAMILY.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.550
AND THEN THAT NIGHT...

19:25.120 --> 19:26.790
THAT NIGHT, YOU TOLD ME
YOU THOUGHT

19:26.790 --> 19:30.060
I SHOULD QUIT
PLAYING FOOTBALL.

19:30.060 --> 19:34.000
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW BETRAYED I FELT.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.300
THAT WAS THE LOWEST
I’D EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE

19:37.300 --> 19:41.810
AND MY OWN WIFE,
IT FELT LIKE SHE

19:41.810 --> 19:43.210
DIDN’T BELIEVE IN
MY DREAMS ANYMORE.

19:43.210 --> 19:44.640
IT FELT LIKE YOU
DIDN’T BELIEVE IN ME.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.410
I WASN’T GIVING UP
ON US.

19:46.410 --> 19:49.250
LAURA, HE’S NOT
BLAMING YOU.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.650
IT’S JUST
HOW HE FELT.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.720
OK. IT’S OK.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.420
I NEEDED TO TALK
TO SOMEONE WHO KNEW

19:54.420 --> 19:56.350
THAT I COULDN’T QUIT
PLAYING FOOTBALL.

19:56.350 --> 19:59.190
SO...I WENT TO CRENSHAW.

20:01.030 --> 20:02.260
TO SEE GRACE.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.360
TO SEE HIS FATHER.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.400
I WAS WALKING
TO CLEAR MY HEAD,

20:06.400 --> 20:07.670
TURNED A CORNER,

20:07.670 --> 20:09.330
AND BILLY WAS
STANDING THERE.

20:09.330 --> 20:11.370
COULDN’T EVEN BRING HIMSELF
TO CROSS THE THRESHOLD.

20:11.370 --> 20:12.800
WILLIE NEVER LIKED LAURA.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.310
EXACTLY. SO, FOR HIM
TO GO IN THERE

20:15.310 --> 20:17.410
AND TELL HIM
WHAT LAURA SAID,

20:17.410 --> 20:19.280
THAT WOULD JUST
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

20:19.280 --> 20:22.710
SO...I OFFERED HIM
AN EAR

20:22.710 --> 20:24.950
AND HE DID THE SAME
FOR ME.

20:24.950 --> 20:30.120
HE TOLD ME...THAT
YOU PROBABLY HADN’T

20:30.120 --> 20:31.420
GOTTEN PAST NOT BEING ABLE

20:31.420 --> 20:32.990
TO PLAY FOOTBALL
PROFESSIONALLY,

20:32.990 --> 20:35.830
AND THAT YOU PROBABLY
NEVER FELT WORTHY,

20:35.830 --> 20:38.700
AND WAS WORRIED THAT I
WOULD STOP LOVING YOU.

20:43.730 --> 20:46.240
I NEED YOU TO KNOW

20:46.240 --> 20:48.310
THAT NO MATTER
HOW UPSET

20:48.310 --> 20:50.370
OR FRUSTRATED I GOT...

20:50.370 --> 20:52.810
I NEVER STOPPED
LOVING YOU.

20:52.810 --> 20:54.910
I WAS TOO BLINDED
BY MY OWN PAIN

20:54.910 --> 20:58.880
TO SEE WHAT I WAS
PUTTING YOU THROUGH.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.190
SO, I DID THE EASY THING

21:01.190 --> 21:02.890
AND LEANED ON
AN OLD FRIEND.

21:02.890 --> 21:05.220
SOMEONE WHO DIDN’T
SEE ME AS AN INJURED,

21:05.220 --> 21:07.020
WASHED-UP FOOTBALL PLAYER.

21:07.020 --> 21:09.730
RIGHT. LIKE I DID.

21:09.730 --> 21:13.730
NO. GRACE
ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD

21:13.730 --> 21:15.600
WHY YOU WANTED ME
TO STOP PLAYING.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.140
SHE EXPLAINED
HOW YOU SAW

21:21.140 --> 21:23.140
WHAT HOLDING ONTO
A SHATTERED DREAM

21:23.140 --> 21:25.110
WAS DOING TO ME,
BUT I WASN’T

21:25.110 --> 21:27.540
IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND
TO LISTEN

21:27.540 --> 21:29.150
AND IT JUST
FELT LIKE YOU WERE

21:29.150 --> 21:31.480
DISMISSING MY ENTIRE
LIFE’S WORK.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.820
...DISMISSING ME.

21:33.820 --> 21:35.190
WHEN YOU WERE
GONE FOR WORK

21:35.190 --> 21:36.790
FOR THOSE LONG STINTS,

21:36.790 --> 21:39.420
I FELT ABANDONED.

21:39.420 --> 21:40.660
UNNEEDED.

21:43.130 --> 21:44.190
THAT NIGHT...

21:48.270 --> 21:50.200
BILLY MADE ME FEEL NEEDED.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.370
GRACE MADE ME FEEL NEEDED.

21:55.510 --> 21:57.070
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER.

21:58.210 --> 22:00.080
BILLY AND GRACE:
AND WE SLEPT TOGETHER.

22:04.780 --> 22:06.050
YOU’RE RIGHT.

22:08.350 --> 22:09.750
IT WAS WORSE.

22:39.380 --> 22:40.750
HEY.

22:42.490 --> 22:43.490
WHAT HAPPENED?

22:43.490 --> 22:45.420
NOTHING.

22:45.420 --> 22:47.420
I’M FINE.
I JUST--

22:47.420 --> 22:48.460
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.560
MA, YOU’RE NOT FINE.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.800
SPENCER...PLEASE.
JUST GO.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.170
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
YOU TOLD ME AND DILLON

23:03.170 --> 23:04.470
THAT CRYING
IS CLEANSING?

23:06.040 --> 23:09.210
THAT IT’S A SIGN OF
HIGHLY EVOLVED BEHAVIOR?

23:09.210 --> 23:11.280
THAT ONLY APPLIES
TO KIDS.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.120
COME ON.

23:22.090 --> 23:23.330
I’M SORRY.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.700
MA, YOU DON’T HAVE
TO EVER APOLOGIZE

23:26.700 --> 23:28.030
FOR CRYING, OK?

23:31.730 --> 23:33.800
THAT’S NOT WHY
I’M APOLOGIZING.

23:38.040 --> 23:43.550
I’M SORRY...
THAT A SELFISH MOMENT

23:43.550 --> 23:46.150
BETWEEN ME AND BILLY

23:46.150 --> 23:49.450
COST YOU YEARS
WITH YOUR FATHER,

23:49.450 --> 23:52.460
YEARS THAT I CAN
NEVER GIVE BACK

23:52.460 --> 23:54.560
TO YOU OR COREY.

23:54.560 --> 23:59.360
BUT NOW...
NOW THAT COREY...

24:01.930 --> 24:04.500
WITH COREY
BEING SICK...

24:06.500 --> 24:07.870
I’M SORRY THAT
YOU AND DILLON

24:07.870 --> 24:09.540
HAVE TO GROW UP
WITH JUST ME.

24:09.540 --> 24:11.340
NO, THERE AIN’T NO
"JUST" ABOUT IT.

24:12.810 --> 24:15.610
BECAUSE OF YOU,
I AM WHO I AM, MA.

24:15.610 --> 24:17.080
YOU ARE WHY I BELIEVE

24:17.080 --> 24:18.750
AND FIGHT FOR MY DREAMS.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.480
THE WAY YOU RAISED ME
IS THE REASON

24:20.480 --> 24:22.790
I’M GONNA MAKE IT TO
THE SUPER BOWL ONE DAY.

24:22.790 --> 24:25.460
AND WHEN I DO,
AND I WIN,

24:25.460 --> 24:27.660
IT’S THE REASON I’M GONNA
STAND ON THAT PODIUM

24:27.660 --> 24:28.790
AND I’M GONNA
TELL THE WORLD

24:28.790 --> 24:30.530
THAT YOU’RE MY MVP.

24:30.530 --> 24:31.890
YOU HEAR ME?

24:35.470 --> 24:36.600
COME HERE.

24:39.370 --> 24:41.640
HOW DID I GET
SO LUCKY WITH MY BOYS?

24:56.390 --> 24:59.320
WHOA. WHEN DID YOU
BECOME VAN GOGH?

25:02.360 --> 25:05.830
WHILE I WAS AT REHAB,
I DID ART THERAPY.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.160
JORDAN: WOW.
OLIVIA: IT WAS THE ONE THING

25:07.160 --> 25:08.560
I COULD DO TO
COMMUNICATE HOW

25:08.560 --> 25:10.170
I WAS ACTUALLY FEELING.

25:10.170 --> 25:12.970
HOW DID I NOT KNOW
YOU WERE THIS TALENTED?

25:12.970 --> 25:15.970
OK, SO, WHAT’S
YOUR ARTISTIC TAKE

25:15.970 --> 25:17.210
ON WHAT OUR FAMILY
FEELS LIKE?

25:17.210 --> 25:18.510
WAIT, NOW, JORDAN,
THAT’S PRIVATE.

25:18.510 --> 25:20.080
-JORDAN! JORDAN!
-WHOA!

25:24.380 --> 25:28.480
WAIT. WHY AM I NOT IN
YOUR FAMILY PICTURE?

25:30.950 --> 25:32.450
I MEAN, IT’S
STICK FIGURES, BUT

25:32.450 --> 25:34.390
AT LEAST I MADE
A FAMILY PORTRAIT, LIV.

25:34.390 --> 25:35.930
IT JUST FEELS LIKE
YOU’RE MISSING

25:35.930 --> 25:37.630
FROM MY LIFE
A LOT OF THE TIME.

25:37.630 --> 25:40.360
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I’M RIGHT HERE, LIV.

25:40.360 --> 25:43.300
GROWING UP, WE WERE
BEST FRIENDS.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.230
YEAH.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.300
DAD WAS ALWAYS
ON THE ROAD

25:46.300 --> 25:48.340
AND MOM WORKED
LONG HOURS, BUT

25:48.340 --> 25:51.970
IT DIDN’T MATTER
BECAUSE WE HAD EACH OTHER.

25:51.970 --> 25:55.910
AND WHEN DAD CAME HOME
AFTER HE RETIRED,

25:55.910 --> 25:59.250
YOU ABANDONED ME,

25:59.250 --> 26:01.550
AND YOU STARTED
PLAYING FOOTBALL,

26:01.550 --> 26:05.450
AND YOU MADE NEW FRIENDS,
AND IT JUST FELT LIKE

26:05.450 --> 26:07.290
YOU DIDN’T NEED ME ANYMORE.

26:11.430 --> 26:14.230
LIV...LOOK.

26:15.830 --> 26:18.530
YEAH. OK, WHEN DAD
CAME HOME,

26:18.530 --> 26:21.840
I, I STARTED FOCUSING
ON FOOTBALL.

26:21.840 --> 26:24.140
YOU GUYS ALWAYS HAD THIS
SPECIAL DADDY’S GIRL BOND

26:24.140 --> 26:25.410
AND I DIDN’T HAVE ANYTHING

26:25.410 --> 26:27.110
EVEN CLOSE TO THAT WITH HIM.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.010
SO, YEAH.

26:29.010 --> 26:30.410
I THREW MYSELF INTO FOOTBALL

26:30.410 --> 26:31.810
TO BOND WITH DAD, BUT...

26:33.120 --> 26:35.550
I WASN’T TRYING
TO SHUT YOU OUT.

26:35.550 --> 26:38.490
BESIDES, YOU...
YOU HAD YOUR WHOLE

26:38.490 --> 26:40.020
NEW GROUP OF FRIENDS
AND YOU WERE

26:40.020 --> 26:42.060
DOING YOUR
PARTYING THING, AND

26:42.060 --> 26:43.430
I JUST ASSUMED
THAT’S WHAT YOU WANTED

26:43.430 --> 26:44.860
AND LEFT YOU ALONE.

26:44.860 --> 26:48.360
YOU THOUGHT I WANTED
TO LOSE MY BROTHER?

26:48.360 --> 26:50.030
MY BEST FRIEND? NO.

26:50.030 --> 26:51.800
THAT WAS NEVER
WHAT I WANTED.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.040
THIS IS GONNA
SOUND STUPID AND SELFISH.

26:59.040 --> 26:59.980
SAY IT ANYWAY.

27:01.140 --> 27:04.150
I JUST--I FEEL LIKE...

27:04.150 --> 27:07.420
I JUST FEEL LIKE I’M
FINALLY GETTING YOU BACK.

27:07.420 --> 27:09.820
BUT WITH THE BABY
COMING NOW, I MEAN,

27:09.820 --> 27:12.860
YOU’RE STARTING A WHOLE
NEW FAMILY WITH SIMONE,

27:12.860 --> 27:14.990
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT
YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

27:14.990 --> 27:19.960
I’M JUST...
I’M JUST AFRAID

27:19.960 --> 27:21.060
I’M GONNA LOSE YOU AGAIN.

27:24.500 --> 27:30.010
HEY...YOU’RE NOT
GONNA LOSE ME.

27:35.410 --> 27:36.550
COREY: AH.

27:38.350 --> 27:39.350
HEY.

27:39.350 --> 27:40.420
SPENCER: WHAT’S ALL THIS?

27:40.420 --> 27:42.420
DAD’S LETTING US
GO CAMPING TONIGHT.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.250
YOU EVER TRIED ARGUING
WITH THIS KID?

27:44.250 --> 27:45.490
LOSING BATTLE EVERY TIME.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.560
FOUND THEM.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.260
DILLON: HEADS UP!

27:50.260 --> 27:52.360
MAN AND GRACE: OOH!
DARNELL: NICE TRY, D.

27:52.360 --> 27:53.900
AIN’T NOTHING GETTING
PAST THESE MAGIC HANDS.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.300
DILLON: OK. I SEE.
DARNELL: PURE SKILLS.

27:55.300 --> 27:57.670
YEAH? WE’LL SEE
ABOUT THAT.

27:57.670 --> 27:59.270
SO, WHO’S UP FOR A GAME?

27:59.270 --> 28:00.600
DEFINITELY ME.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.800
SAY THE WORD.

28:03.340 --> 28:04.810
A’IGHT,
LET’S GET IT.

28:04.810 --> 28:06.370
AIN’T NOBODY GOING EASY
ON YOU, OLD MAN.

28:06.370 --> 28:07.810
MUSIC TO MY EARS.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.610
HEY, WHATEVER.

28:09.610 --> 28:11.250
SO, WHAT’S THE RULES?

28:11.250 --> 28:13.220
BOY, WE IN THE WOODS.
AIN’T NO RULES.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.550
OH!

28:14.550 --> 28:16.380
MAN: ♪ RIGHT, RIGHT,
’CAUSE IT BE ALL RIGHT ♪

28:16.380 --> 28:18.590
♪ ’CAUSE IT’S ALREADY ON FIRE ♪

28:18.590 --> 28:20.220
MAN: RIGHT.
DARNELL: RUN A MOVE.

28:20.220 --> 28:23.330
DARNELL: DOWN, SET, HUT!

28:25.360 --> 28:26.230
OH! OH!

28:28.430 --> 28:30.930
MAN: LET IT GO.
LET IT GO.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.400
DILLON, COME HERE.

28:35.740 --> 28:37.740
DILLON: AHH!
GRACE: HEY!

28:37.740 --> 28:39.640
COME ON, NOW.
WAIT A MINUTE.

28:39.640 --> 28:40.940
A’IGHT, YOU GOT MOM.
YOU GOT MOM.

28:40.940 --> 28:43.810
WAIT A MINUTE.
OK! OK.

28:43.810 --> 28:47.320
DARNELL: GREAT. DOWN.
TEN. HUT!

28:56.230 --> 28:57.530
DR. GIBBS: BILLY,
I KNOW THIS IS HARD,

28:57.530 --> 28:58.560
BUT REMEMBER,
FOR YOU, THE AFFAIR

28:58.560 --> 28:59.830
HAPPENED 9 YEARS AGO.

29:00.330 --> 29:01.730
BUT FOR LAURA,
IT FEELS LIKE

29:01.730 --> 29:03.230
IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

29:03.230 --> 29:04.400
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.340
I JUST WISH I KNEW
HOW TO MAKE HER BELIEVE

29:06.340 --> 29:08.140
HOW MUCH SHE MEANS
TO ME.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.370
IF SHE WERE HERE
RIGHT NOW,

29:09.370 --> 29:10.610
WHAT WOULD YOU
SAY TO HER?

29:15.010 --> 29:16.540
YOU KNOW, I THANK YOU

29:16.540 --> 29:17.750
FOR EVERYTHING
YOU’VE DONE TODAY.

29:17.750 --> 29:18.780
I FEEL LIKE
THIS SESSION

29:18.780 --> 29:21.220
SHOULD BE ABOUT OVER.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.950
HUMOR ME.

29:22.950 --> 29:25.250
PRETEND LAURA
IS RIGHT THERE.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.560
I’M NOT GONNA TALK
TO AN EMPTY CHAIR.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.090
I CAN’T.

29:31.060 --> 29:34.530
I’M NOT GONNA DO IT.

29:34.530 --> 29:35.600
TELL ME THEN.

29:40.670 --> 29:42.570
I JUST HEARD
THE TWINS HAVE PROBABLY

29:42.570 --> 29:44.770
THE MOST
HONEST CONVERSATION

29:44.770 --> 29:46.770
I HAVE HEARD
IN THIS HOUSE

29:46.770 --> 29:48.610
IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

29:51.050 --> 29:54.720
SO, IF THEY’RE
MATURE ENOUGH

29:54.720 --> 29:55.920
TO BATTLE THROUGH IT...

29:58.620 --> 29:59.790
SO AM I.

30:03.630 --> 30:04.530
TRUTHFULLY...

30:08.600 --> 30:12.200
I DON’T KNOW HOW
TO GET THROUGH

30:12.200 --> 30:14.800
THIS THING CALLED LIFE
WITHOUT YOU, LAURA.

30:16.040 --> 30:18.740
YOU PUSH ME TO BE
A BETTER MAN

30:18.740 --> 30:20.910
EVEN WHEN IT’S
SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.650
THAT’S WHAT YOU WERE
DOING THAT NIGHT,

30:25.650 --> 30:30.650
AND, UH...INSTEAD OF
MANNING UP

30:32.750 --> 30:33.990
AND LOOKING INTO
OUR FUTURE,

30:33.990 --> 30:38.630
I...RAN BACK INTO MY PAST.

30:40.930 --> 30:42.200
I WAS SELFISH...

30:44.770 --> 30:47.170
AND I’M SO SORRY
I HURT YOU.

30:48.770 --> 30:50.670
I’M SO SORRY
THAT I HURT US.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.710
I WANT TO BE
THAT MAN THAT

30:55.710 --> 30:57.780
YOU USED TO BE ABLE
TO DEPEND ON.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.080
’CAUSE I LOVE YOU
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

31:03.920 --> 31:07.060
AND I LOVE THE FAMILY
THAT WE BUILT.

31:13.700 --> 31:14.900
LOOK, I’M BEGGING YOU.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.800
GIVE ME ONE MORE CHANCE.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.070
LET ME MAKE THIS RIGHT.

31:25.810 --> 31:27.240
I’LL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

31:32.650 --> 31:33.850
I BELIEVE YOU.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.660
COREY: HEY.
WALK WITH ME A MINUTE.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.230
A’IGHT.

31:58.540 --> 32:00.240
DARNELL SAID SOMETHING,
DIDN’T HE?

32:00.240 --> 32:03.610
BETTER LATE THAN NEVER.
SO, HOW ABOUT IT?

32:03.610 --> 32:05.380
YOU WANT TO GO FISHING
WITH YOUR OLD MAN?

32:13.790 --> 32:16.260
BILLY, I CAN’T HAVE
ANOTHER DISCUSSION.

32:16.260 --> 32:18.560
I HAVE NOTHING LEFT.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.330
I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU DON’T HAVE TO TALK.

32:21.330 --> 32:23.200
THIS IS A GIFT. UH,

32:23.200 --> 32:25.830
DR. GIBBS SAID THAT
BEFORE OUR NEXT SESSION,

32:25.830 --> 32:28.740
WE SHOULD GIVE EACH OTHER
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL

32:28.740 --> 32:30.700
THAT, UH, THAT REPRESENTED

32:30.700 --> 32:32.710
THE DEPTH OF OUR LOVE.

32:32.710 --> 32:35.880
SHE’S REAL WORDY,
THAT DR. GIBBS.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.610
YEAH.

32:37.610 --> 32:40.280
THIS BOOK IS
MY GIFT TO YOU.

32:40.280 --> 32:43.050
NO EXPECTATIONS.
NO DEMANDS.

32:44.580 --> 32:47.720
SAVED EVERY--EVERY NOTE,
EVERY LETTER

32:47.720 --> 32:51.290
THAT YOU SLIPPED
INTO MY GYM BAG,

32:51.290 --> 32:52.930
MY SOCK DRAWER,
MY SUITCASE.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.300
YOU SAVED ALL THESE?

32:56.300 --> 32:58.200
YEAH.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.930
UM,. THERE’S THIS
ONE LETTER.

33:00.930 --> 33:04.640
YOU WROTE ME THAT
RIGHT AFTER I LOST
MY MOTHER.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.710
THE MOMENT I READ IT,

33:06.710 --> 33:09.710
I KNEW ONE DAY I WAS
GONNA MAKE YOU MY WIFE.

33:09.710 --> 33:12.250
"I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I SEE YOU,

33:12.250 --> 33:15.250
"I HEAR YOU,
I FEEL YOUR PAIN,

33:15.250 --> 33:17.280
AND I’LL BE HERE..."

33:17.280 --> 33:19.950
’HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES."

33:19.950 --> 33:22.620
AND YOU KEPT
YOUR PROMISE.

33:22.620 --> 33:23.720
YOU SHOWED UP
FOR ME.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.230
SO, I’M GONNA
SHOW UP FOR YOU.

33:27.230 --> 33:29.600
I’M GONNA SHOW UP
FOR OUR MARRIAGE.

33:30.900 --> 33:33.600
BECAUSE--BECAUSE--

33:42.010 --> 33:43.940
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

33:56.590 --> 33:58.690
THIS REALLY ALL WE DO
WHEN WE FISH?

33:58.690 --> 34:02.300
JUST SIT AROUND
AND WATCH NOTHING HAPPEN?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.260
COME ON, MAN.
THEM FISH PROBABLY

34:04.260 --> 34:06.270
DOWN THERE
CLOWNING US RIGHT NOW.

34:06.270 --> 34:08.840
FISHING AIN’T REALLY
ABOUT FISHING.

34:08.840 --> 34:11.910
IT’S ABOUT TAKING
THE TIME TO JUST BE.

34:11.910 --> 34:14.910
REALIGNING YOURSELF
WITH NATURE.

34:14.910 --> 34:16.210
PRACTICING PATIENCE.

34:16.210 --> 34:18.580
AH, THE INFAMOUS SPEECH.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.250
IT’S A CHANCE TO
CENTER YOUR THOUGHTS.

34:24.250 --> 34:26.690
MY THOUGHTS ARE
CENTERED, ALL RIGHT.

34:26.690 --> 34:28.590
THEY CENTERED ON
HOW HUNGRY I’MA BE

34:28.590 --> 34:30.120
IF WE DON’T CATCH
SOMETHING TO GRILL
REAL SOON.

34:43.700 --> 34:45.510
WHAT YOU CENTERING
YOUR THOUGHTS ON?

34:48.740 --> 34:49.680
DYING.

34:54.710 --> 34:57.320
I’M SCARED TO DIE ALONE.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.790
YOU DON’T HAVE TO.

35:03.320 --> 35:06.530
YOU GOT A FAMILY.
YOU HEAR ME?

35:06.530 --> 35:08.460
LET US BE THERE
FOR YOU, MAN.

35:09.930 --> 35:12.100
COME HOME WITH US.

35:12.100 --> 35:14.700
LOOK HOW GOOD
TODAY TURNED OUT.

35:14.700 --> 35:15.970
ALL OF US TOGETHER.

35:18.610 --> 35:19.770
HEY, LOOK, MAYBE IT’S
WISHFUL THINKING,

35:19.770 --> 35:22.140
BUT YOU EVEN
LOOK BETTER.

35:22.140 --> 35:24.480
HAVING US AROUND IS
GOOD FOR YOU, POP.

35:26.110 --> 35:29.950
AND WHEN THE CANCER
TAKES OVER,

35:29.950 --> 35:31.720
AND THE DAYS
AIN’T SO GOOD,

35:31.720 --> 35:33.790
WE’RE GONNA GET THROUGH
THOSE TOGETHER, TOO.

35:33.790 --> 35:34.990
YOU HEAR ME?

35:41.130 --> 35:43.000
DON’T THINK NOBODY
FEELING SORRY FOR
YOU, NEITHER.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.200
I’M BEING SELFISH.

35:45.630 --> 35:48.170
I WANT YOU TO
COME HOME FOR ME
AND DILLON.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.640
HAVING YOU
AROUND MAKES
OUR LIVES BETTER.

35:53.640 --> 35:57.010
YOU KNOW...ONE OF
THE THINGS

35:57.010 --> 35:59.180
I LOVE MOST ABOUT YOU

35:59.180 --> 36:00.850
IS HOW WILLINGLY
YOU SHOW

36:00.850 --> 36:02.680
YOUR VULNERABILITY.

36:02.680 --> 36:05.320
I WAS NEVER
TAUGHT THAT.

36:05.320 --> 36:08.520
I WAS ALWAYS TAUGHT
TO BURY IT AND RUN.

36:11.660 --> 36:13.660
IT’S AN HONOR
AND A BLESSING

36:13.660 --> 36:15.700
TO LEARN FROM
MY OWN SON

36:15.700 --> 36:18.570
THAT THERE’S STRENGTH
IN VULNERABILITY.

36:18.570 --> 36:21.540
COREY: PROMISE ME SOMETHING.
SPENCER: ANYTHING.

36:21.540 --> 36:24.540
PROMISE YOU’LL
INSTILL THAT IN
YOUR BROTHER, TOO.

36:26.170 --> 36:30.180
I WILL, POP.
I PROMISE.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.750
I LOVE YOU, SON.

BRINGING THE BOYS.

YOU’RE WELCOME.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.260
HOLD ON A MINUTE.
I’LL BE RIGHT BACK.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.140
WHAT’S THIS?

38:02.140 --> 38:03.540
IT’S THE DEED
TO THE CABIN.

38:03.540 --> 38:06.240
I’M LEAVING IT
TO SPENCER AND DILLON.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.310
HOPEFULLY,
THEY’LL PASS IT ON

38:07.310 --> 38:09.680
TO THEIR KIDS
ONE DAY.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.250
PART OF
THE JAMES LEGACY.

38:12.250 --> 38:13.680
I’LL MAKE SURE
THEY DO.

38:19.320 --> 38:22.260
IT’S KIND OF
A WEIRD COINCIDENCE,

38:22.260 --> 38:24.690
YOU GIVING ME THIS.

38:24.690 --> 38:27.560
SEE, I, UH...
I CAME OUT HERE

38:27.560 --> 38:28.560
TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING.

38:44.140 --> 38:45.340
HE’S MINE?

38:47.480 --> 38:48.480
DILLON IS YOUR SON.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.160
TODAY’S GONNA BE
A GREAT DAY.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.190
I CAN FEEL IT.

39:00.190 --> 39:01.330
YEAH.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.430
WE SHOULD WAKE
THE BOYS UP

39:04.430 --> 39:05.830
IF WE’RE GONNA FINISH
GETTING THIS PLACE

39:05.830 --> 39:07.500
PACKED UP BEFORE
WE HIT THE ROAD.

39:09.300 --> 39:10.700
"WE"?

39:10.700 --> 39:12.210
IF YOU GOT ROOM
FOR ME IN CRENSHAW.

39:13.640 --> 39:14.970
I’D LIKE TO COME HOME.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.510
THERE’S ALWAYS
ROOM FOR YOU.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.460
WOW, THE SQUIRRELS
IN CALI ARE HUGE.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.330
IT’S NOT LIKE THAT
IN NEVADA.

39:33.330 --> 39:34.790
DILLON: REALLY?
DARNELL: YOU AIN’T GONNA
EAT THIS, THOUGH, RIGHT?

39:34.790 --> 39:36.360
HEY, I WOULDN’T
TOUCH HIS FOOD, MAN.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.060
DILLON: YEAH!
BACK OFF THE BACON!

39:38.060 --> 39:39.870
DARNELL: YOU MEAN THIS BACON?
DILLON: YEAH, I MEAN THAT BACON.

39:39.870 --> 39:42.500
YEAH. THANK YOU.
YEAH--OH, REALLY?

39:42.500 --> 39:43.900
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT
THIS BACON.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.770

THAT GIFT.

40:05.490 --> 40:06.760
DON’T WORRY.
I’LL GRAB IT FOR YOU.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.060
SPENCER: YOU SURE?
COREY: YEAH.

40:08.060 --> 40:09.530
I THINK IT’S ON
THE LIVING ROOM TABLE.

40:09.530 --> 40:11.460
DILLON: TALK ABOUT WEAK.

40:11.460 --> 40:13.430
CARRYING OUT
ONE BOX, MAN.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.840
DARNELL: YOU LAZY.
YOU DON’T CARRY NOTHING.

40:16.840 --> 40:18.840
DILLON: LAZY?
DARNELL: THERE’S THE LAST BOX.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.910
SPENCER: YOU KNOW
THAT’S NOT GONNA FIT, RIGHT?

40:19.910 --> 40:21.170
GRACE: LET ME TRY.

40:21.170 --> 40:22.810
MA, I’M
TELLING YOU--

40:22.810 --> 40:24.780
AH-AH-AH.
THERE’S A METHOD TO MY MADNESS.

40:29.380 --> 40:31.480
DARNELL AND SPENCER: OH.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.850
TOLD YOU.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.120
YOU DIDN’T SAY--
MAN, SHUT UP.

40:35.990 --> 40:36.960
ALL RIGHT, MS. JAMES.

40:39.830 --> 40:41.830
HEY, I GOT SHOTGUN
IN DAD’S CAR.

40:41.830 --> 40:44.260
THE HELL YOU DO...
I ALREADY CALLED IT.

40:44.260 --> 40:45.900
WHAT? NOBODY WANTS
TO RIDE WITH ME?

40:45.900 --> 40:47.300
SPENCER: NO OFFENSE, MA,
BUT THERE WAS GRANDMAS

40:47.300 --> 40:48.470
PASSING YOU ON THE 10.

40:49.970 --> 40:51.870
EXCUSE ME
FOR BEING SAFE.

40:51.870 --> 40:53.510
HEY, WHAT’S TAKING
SO LONG, OLD MAN?

40:56.140 --> 40:57.340
HEY, POPS, LET’S ROLL.

41:00.910 --> 41:01.850
DAD?

41:09.990 --> 41:10.920
DAD?

41:14.990 --> 41:16.760
DAD! HEY.

41:19.530 --> 41:23.170
HEY, COME ON.

41:31.280 --> 41:32.940
GRACE: OH, MY GOD, COME HERE.
SPENCER: DAD.

41:38.920 --> 41:41.390
AAAAH!

42:19.190 --> 42:20.730
MAN: GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD.
