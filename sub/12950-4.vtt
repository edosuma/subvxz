00:01.234 --> 00:03.794
<i>Seven years ago, I was
recruited to work for SD-6,</i>

00:03.903 --> 00:06.338
<i>which I was told
was a covert branch of the CIA.</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:08.140
<i>I was trained as a spy,</i>

00:08.141 --> 00:10.641
<i>warned not to tell anyone
what I did.</i>

00:10.643 --> 00:12.644
<i>I thought I was working
for the good guys,</i>

00:12.645 --> 00:15.614
<i>until I told my fiancé
about SD-6</i>

00:15.682 --> 00:16.815
<i>and they had him killed.</i>

00:16.816 --> 00:18.417
<i>That's when I learned
the truth.</i>

00:18.418 --> 00:21.546
<i>That SD-6 is part of the very
enemy I thought I was fighting.</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:23.188
<i>Now I'm a double agent,</i>

00:23.189 --> 00:26.090
<i>working with the real CIA
to bring down SD-6,</i>

00:26.159 --> 00:28.160
<i>where my only ally
is another double agent,</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:29.928
<i>a man I hardly know.</i>

00:29.929 --> 00:31.263
<i>My father.</i>

00:31.264 --> 00:33.764
Rambaldi has become
a priority for us.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.634
We need to get that code.

00:35.635 --> 00:36.635
We learned yesterday

00:36.636 --> 00:40.572
that the K-Directorate agent
stole the key to the lockbox.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.140
It was Anna, wasn't it?

00:49.449 --> 00:52.976
Obviously, we need the key.
Obviously, they need the box.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.254
Six hours ago,
I contacted K-Directorate.

00:55.255 --> 00:57.122
We settled on an arrangement.

00:57.123 --> 01:00.581
You and Anna will meet
at a neutral location

01:00.660 --> 01:03.160
under cover of both agencies'
security forces.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.993
Together
you'll open the lockbox.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074

01:20.680 --> 01:22.314
Oh, my God.

01:36.129 --> 01:37.863
0-0-1-0-0,

01:37.864 --> 01:40.364
1-0-0-1-0-0...

02:01.688 --> 02:02.988
Did you get it?

02:02.989 --> 02:05.489
Did you?

02:07.660 --> 02:09.094
Dixon, I'm ending transmission.

02:09.095 --> 02:11.689
She turned off her mike.
I've lost her signal.

02:11.764 --> 02:13.532
0-0-1-0.
Did you get that?

02:13.533 --> 02:14.766
Got it.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.135
I'm giving SD-6
the wrong number.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.170
No, no.
You give them exactly...

02:18.171 --> 02:20.239
I'm not giving them
the right sequence.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.340
Forget it.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.175
Listen to me.
This is critical.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.577
Give them the number.
That's an order.

02:25.578 --> 02:26.778
- An order?
- Yes.

02:26.779 --> 02:29.907
We have to have a long talk
when I get back to Los Angeles.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.220
Dixon, I've got the code.

02:35.221 --> 02:36.321
Go!

02:36.322 --> 02:40.759
0-1-0-0-0-1-1-0-0...

02:40.827 --> 02:43.523
Null, adin, null, adin...

02:43.596 --> 02:46.656
1-0-0-0-1-1-0-0-1-1-1.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.969
Just two ones.

02:50.970 --> 02:51.970
Then...

02:51.971 --> 02:56.965
Null, adin, adin,
null, null, adin, null.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.179
1-1-0-1.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.680
That's it.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.181
1-1-0-1.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.020
You did good.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.370
You do not give me orders!

03:25.371 --> 03:28.306
I could easily
have misled SD-6.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.442
Just stop talking
for a second.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.943
If you'd given SD-6
a bogus code,

03:33.046 --> 03:34.046
what would have happened

03:34.047 --> 03:35.814
when Anna gave K-Directorate
the correct sequence?

03:35.815 --> 03:38.050
They would have thought
I made a mistake.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.484
And that Anna didn't?

03:39.485 --> 03:41.653
She would have given them
the correct code.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.522
They would have seen the code
indicate at Athens.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.023
K- Directorate would head there.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.551
SD-6 would have nothing.
They would suspect you.

03:48.628 --> 03:50.729
We have to be
very careful here.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.426
We have to be
wildly, crazy careful.

03:53.499 --> 03:57.094
If SD-6 suspects you
in the least, it's over.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.701
Anna's been the enemy
for three years.

04:06.813 --> 04:09.611
In Berlin, I realized
she wants SD-6 to burn

04:09.682 --> 04:12.182
almost as much as I do.

04:12.552 --> 04:15.146
As far as the CIA's concerned,
the only thing worse

04:15.221 --> 04:17.781
than SD-6 getting its hands
on critical information

04:17.857 --> 04:20.357
is if K-Directorate
gets it first.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.294
Anna is still your enemy.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.236
You're not into mysticism,
are you?

04:30.303 --> 04:31.837
Neither am I,
but keep an open mind.

04:31.838 --> 04:32.838
It'll help.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.501
The code was written in 1489.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.805
The guy who wrote it
was some sort of Nostradamus.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.646
His name was Milo Rambaldi.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.347
This binary was written

04:42.348 --> 04:44.848
by a 15th-century
fortune teller?

04:44.884 --> 04:46.618
How come I've never
heard of him?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.816
His designs were so advanced,
they assumed he was insane.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.089
On some of his drawings,

04:51.090 --> 04:52.791
he made lists
of part numbers.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.559
I.D. Numbers
of actual technology

04:54.560 --> 04:56.495
not manufactured
until this year.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.497
It's real.
It's a hunt.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.832
This man spent
the last 10 years of his life

05:00.833 --> 05:02.000
working on one project.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.769
We don't whether it's a weapon,

05:03.770 --> 05:06.270
a fuel source,
a transportation system.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.572
Based on the little
we do know,

05:07.573 --> 05:11.236
its technology that's beyond
anything we have ever seen.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.611
How's your wife?

05:12.612 --> 05:14.413
I forgot to ask.

05:14.414 --> 05:17.611
Uh... good. Yours?

05:17.684 --> 05:19.885
Actually, Emily's a bit
under the weather.

05:19.886 --> 05:23.014
But thanks for asking.
Come on.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.223
Did you read the report?

05:25.224 --> 05:27.459
They found nothing.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.528
This is Anthony Russett.

05:29.529 --> 05:31.530
He's transferring here
from Jennings.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.198
He's working
on the U.C.O. File.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.634
You've already met Marshall.
This is Sydney Bristow.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.169
I know your father.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.603
We read the code you recovered.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.872
Accordingly,
we sent a team to Athens.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.433
I just got a phone call
from SD-3.

05:43.543 --> 05:46.603
He said there was no evidence
pertaining to Rambaldi,

05:46.679 --> 05:48.513
and we were there first.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.847
Turns out we made
a giant mistake.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.512
But so did K-Directorate.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.385
In our rush to decipher
the Rambaldi enigma,

05:57.457 --> 05:59.191
we misinterpreted the code.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.252
It left us
with two series of digits.

06:02.328 --> 06:03.462
We assumed longitude
and latitude,

06:03.463 --> 06:05.230
but he was using
a compression scheme.

06:05.231 --> 06:07.466
I should have seen that.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.868
Instead of sending a team
to Athens,

06:09.869 --> 06:11.870
we should have been headed
to Málaga, Spain.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.635
Which is where you're going.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.175
There's a 500-year-old church
on the exact site

06:17.176 --> 06:19.544
of Rambaldi's coordinates.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.979
What am I looking for?

06:20.980 --> 06:22.214
We don't know.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.516
The only clue we have,
if it is indeed a clue,

06:24.517 --> 06:26.418
are two words
that were part of a code.

06:26.419 --> 06:28.353
<i>Sol D'Oro.</i>

06:28.354 --> 06:30.854
Golden sun.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.712
I was hoping you'd come.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.807
You haven't said anything
to Charlie?

10:08.808 --> 10:10.408
I needed
to talk to you first.

10:10.409 --> 10:12.310
It's just a matchbook
with someone's number.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.779
Someone named Rachel
who truly loved tonight.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.147
You have to ask Charlie
about it.

10:16.148 --> 10:18.316
What else are you gonna do?

10:18.317 --> 10:20.817
Have you ever spied
on anyone?

10:22.321 --> 10:23.822
I know it's totally beneath me,

10:23.823 --> 10:26.323
but Charlie has been
so distant lately.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.892
Every time I ask him
what's wrong, he's like,

10:28.961 --> 10:31.129
"Nothing, baby.
Everything's cool. "

10:31.130 --> 10:33.630
You don't believe him.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.900
He has Law Review
in an hour.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.335
You want to follow him.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.836
So much
I cannot even tell you.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.141
I think
spying on your boyfriend

10:44.143 --> 10:46.737
is generally regarded
as a bad relationship precedent.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.312
What if he's cheating on me?

10:59.225 --> 11:02.217
- You're a really good friend.
- Yes.

11:05.197 --> 11:08.724
So, this thing happened
with Will the other night.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.235
Did he come on to you?

11:10.236 --> 11:12.736
No. No.

11:13.472 --> 11:16.066
- I kissed him.
- What?!

11:16.175 --> 11:18.803
You kissed Will Tippin?
Are you kidding me?

11:18.878 --> 11:20.679
We were in the apartment
by ourselves.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.881
You and Charlie left.
We'd had all those drinks.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.382
I don't believe it.

11:25.651 --> 11:28.176
Hey, there he is.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.454
Start the car.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.955
No, you wait
till he's a block away.

11:32.558 --> 11:35.058
Look at you,
getting all into it.

11:36.462 --> 11:37.996
Everyone knows you wait.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.198
I don't know you wait.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.699
You wait.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.505
What's he doing?

12:05.958 --> 12:08.586
I guess he's not going
to Law Review.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.532
H- e-c-h-t?

12:15.601 --> 12:17.001
You're certain?

12:17.002 --> 12:18.570
Okay, thank you.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.005
I promise.
I won't call again.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.574
Danny was supposed
to be registered

12:22.575 --> 12:24.309
at a medical conference
in Singapore.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.176
You already told me.

12:25.177 --> 12:27.011
Litvack wants
the Baptist church copy.

12:27.012 --> 12:28.747
I checked
all the conferences twice.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.248
He's not registered
at any of them.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.282
I know.

12:32.918 --> 12:33.752
Will Tippin.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.053
Hey, it's me.

12:35.054 --> 12:38.148
Hey. Hi, uh,
how'd your trip go?

12:38.224 --> 12:40.225
Okay. Fine, thanks.
How are you?

12:40.226 --> 12:42.293
Good. Uh...

12:42.294 --> 12:44.794
Uh, busy. Listen...

12:45.064 --> 12:47.532
You don't feel weird
about what happened, right?

12:47.533 --> 12:49.400
A little.

12:49.401 --> 12:50.568
Me too. What is that?

12:50.569 --> 12:52.537
We'll talk about that later.

12:52.538 --> 12:54.806
Francie and I
saw Charlie last night

12:54.807 --> 12:55.840
with another woman.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.575
What?! You're kidding.

12:57.576 --> 12:59.310
She spent the night
at my place.

12:59.311 --> 13:00.445
She's here now.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.880
She's sort of a mess.

13:01.881 --> 13:02.881
Oh, God.

13:02.882 --> 13:03.948
And the bank called.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.782
Uh...

13:06.852 --> 13:08.286
I might have another trip.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.621
You take an insane amount
of trips.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.922
Would you mind
dropping by later?

13:10.923 --> 13:12.590
Check up on her
and make sure she's okay?

13:12.591 --> 13:14.225
No. Yeah.
Of course, of course.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.527
Okay. Thank you.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.562
- I should go.
- Okay, go.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.063
I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.902
That was Sydney.

13:23.903 --> 13:26.171
You're different
when you talk to Sydney.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.572
Don't analyze me.

13:27.573 --> 13:30.073
Can you get the, uh,
the number of, um,

13:30.176 --> 13:31.442
the guy who works
for the airport?

13:31.443 --> 13:33.378
What's his name?
Luis Scourza.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.479
What?

13:34.480 --> 13:38.246
If you want me to do something,
say "please. "

13:38.317 --> 13:40.817
Please. Scourza. Okay?

13:41.387 --> 13:44.982
"Please" is implicit, Jenny.

14:03.642 --> 14:06.142
Dad.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.243
- You have a meeting with Sloane?
- McCullough.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.917
Psych evaluation?

14:12.918 --> 14:14.452
Routine.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.154
It's nothing I'm not used to.

14:16.155 --> 14:18.256
Nothing I look forward to.

14:18.257 --> 14:20.851
Such is the nature
of the job.

14:26.432 --> 14:29.765
So, Berlin.
It worked out.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.436
My meeting
with K-Directorate...

14:31.437 --> 14:33.905
we got the code.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.740
That was smart.

14:35.741 --> 14:38.209
Well, I should go.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.710
I'll see you later.

14:43.082 --> 14:45.582
Dad.

14:47.653 --> 14:50.088
Could we have dinner?

14:50.089 --> 14:52.751
How about Thursday?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.325
Do you have plans?

14:56.695 --> 14:58.696
No.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.598
Thursday. Dinner.

15:00.599 --> 15:03.099
That'll be fine.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.505
Analysis is working full time

15:07.506 --> 15:09.374
on the piece you brought back
from Spain.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.809
This is not glass.
They know that.

15:11.810 --> 15:13.411
It's a synthetic polymer.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.405
They believe it was made
at least 500 years ago.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.284
Before there were
synthetic polymers?

15:19.285 --> 15:21.686
And so the mystery continues.

15:21.687 --> 15:23.755
Meanwhile,
we have another situation.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.722
This is last year's

15:24.723 --> 15:27.223
United Commerce Organization
Administerial Conference.

15:27.293 --> 15:30.126
A number of groups led planned
attacks against the proceedings.

15:30.195 --> 15:31.596
Zero Defense among them.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.965
Word is they're planning
to attend the conference

15:33.966 --> 15:35.700
this year in Sao Paulo.

15:35.701 --> 15:39.102
Luc Jacqnoud should be landing
in Morocco within 48 hours.

15:39.204 --> 15:42.071
I thought he was in Le Sante
for stabbing a police officer.

15:42.141 --> 15:43.541
Released 26 months early.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.543
He's got ties to French justice.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.879
Intel reports he'll be
in Morocco to meet a client.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.013
I.D. On the client?

15:49.014 --> 15:50.581
None. That's your job.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.183
You're Kate Jones.
Justin Bernell.

15:52.184 --> 15:54.519
You're traveling
with Mindspring Learning Tours.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.521
You arrive on Wednesday.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.556
Your objective is
to monitor the meeting,

15:58.557 --> 16:00.758
I.D. The client,
and make sure whatever it is

16:00.759 --> 16:03.259
that Jacqnoud is up to
doesn't happen.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.662
Is Mochtar the contact?

16:04.663 --> 16:07.163
He's meeting you
at the airport.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.133
This is an Egyptian commando.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.369
We recruited him
two years ago.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.704
Marshall.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.572
Okay.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.274
How is everyone?

16:16.275 --> 16:17.675
Hi. All right.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.011
You're going in
with the usual tech.

16:20.012 --> 16:22.213
Camera, comm gear,
and sat relay.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.615
But this.
This is new.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.414
Now, this looks just like
a normal purse, right?

16:27.486 --> 16:30.148
That you would wear going out
with your lady friends.

16:30.222 --> 16:31.556
Put your feminine things
in there.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.754
But... parabolic microphone.

16:35.894 --> 16:37.929
Has a laser transmitter
that works in a 300-yard radius.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.592
I also added a low-frequency
tantalum wind filter

16:40.666 --> 16:43.260
that will eliminate any unwanted
sounds below 150 Hertz.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.503
Not that you're
gonna be in any wind.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.405
You're probably not
gonna be in any wind.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.007
Let's say that you were
in some wind.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.541
Like a light breeze.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.042
Like a
Or even something stronger.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.645
Like a gust.

16:57.549 --> 17:02.077
This? Nothing. Silent.
Wind filter.

17:03.155 --> 17:07.114
You feel lighter than air.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.719
And as you continue
moving downward,

17:10.796 --> 17:14.857
you feel more and more relaxed.

17:14.933 --> 17:19.131
The escalator continues down.

17:19.238 --> 17:22.070
The closer you get
to the light,

17:22.141 --> 17:26.099
the more relaxed you feel.

17:26.211 --> 17:30.113
The escalator seems
to continue forever.

17:30.182 --> 17:36.018
You feel safe and relaxed.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.114
Still listening to my voice,

17:39.191 --> 17:41.325
you keep going.

17:41.326 --> 17:43.561
And the farther you go,

17:43.562 --> 17:47.555
the more comfortable you feel.

17:47.633 --> 17:51.729
Completely safe...

17:51.837 --> 17:55.238
and comfortable.

18:00.212 --> 18:03.477
It's only a matter of time
before I find out the truth.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.883
Jack?

18:08.554 --> 18:11.054
Just give me a minute,
will you?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.750
Sorry I'm late.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.345
That's all right.
You okay?

18:42.421 --> 18:44.155
Yeah.

18:44.156 --> 18:47.250
Turns out we knew
Jacqnoud was traveling.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.860
We thought he was going
to Bahrain.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.162
We don't know why SD-6
is so interested in U.C.O.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.697
You sure you're okay?

18:52.698 --> 18:54.966
Yeah, I just...

18:54.967 --> 18:57.135
Did you have a fight
with your wife?

18:57.136 --> 18:58.503
- My what?
- Your wife.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.571
What wife?
I have no wife.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.073
No?

19:02.074 --> 19:04.075
There was a picture
in your office.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.143
I thought you were married.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.844
She and I are not remotely...

19:06.845 --> 19:09.541
You thought I was married
this whole time?

19:09.615 --> 19:11.516
I guess so.
What's the big deal?

19:11.517 --> 19:14.017
Nothing.

19:17.422 --> 19:21.620
So, when you get an idea
on who he's meeting,

19:21.693 --> 19:24.423
and/or details of that meeting,
call the usual number.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.397
Hit the 8 key.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.299
We'll dead-drop
in the trash can.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.667
Why didn't you ask me

19:29.668 --> 19:32.398
if I had a fight
with my girlfriend?

19:32.504 --> 19:34.005
I don't know. Did you?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.506
Huge.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.512
Good luck in Morocco.

19:44.349 --> 19:46.849
Thanks.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.581
Look at you.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.618
It's been awhile.

20:23.488 --> 20:25.256
Ah. Hello.

20:25.257 --> 20:27.158
- How have you been?
- Lately, too busy.

20:27.159 --> 20:29.393
Too many people
with dangerous toys.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.461
Any news on Jacqnoud?

20:30.462 --> 20:31.562
Yes, a friend tells me

20:31.563 --> 20:34.464
he's meeting a client today
at a local marketplace.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.000
I've got a good spot
for us.

20:36.001 --> 20:37.935
- Any word on the client?
- Big mystery.

20:37.936 --> 20:39.203
We still don't know.

20:39.204 --> 20:41.672
Come. I'm parked
right over there.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.904
Charlie has called
my cellphone six times.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.010
You still haven't seen him?

20:46.011 --> 20:49.276
No. I want him to suffer.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.649
I'm not even gonna
tell him where I am.

20:51.650 --> 20:54.710
How is Chicago?
Did you get there okay?

20:54.786 --> 20:56.120
Yeah. Chicago's fine.

20:56.121 --> 20:58.256
Look, let me just say
one thing.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.157
Just so someone's saying it.

21:00.158 --> 21:02.093
There might be
an explanation.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.161
He got into a car
with a woman I have never met.

21:04.162 --> 21:07.689
Just talk to him.
Tell Charlie what you saw.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.933
You owe him that.

21:08.934 --> 21:11.926
Maybe. After he calls me
a few more times.

21:12.037 --> 21:14.537
Call me if you need me, okay?
Love you.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.040
Love you.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.541
How's the view?

21:24.483 --> 21:26.983
You want to give this
a test run?

21:31.056 --> 21:32.556
Can you hear me?

21:32.557 --> 21:33.624
Loud and clear.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.359
Jacqnoud just walked in.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.695
Who's he with?

21:37.696 --> 21:39.063
Uh...

21:39.064 --> 21:41.032
Looks like he's solo.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.034
You ready?

21:43.035 --> 21:45.436
I'm going shopping.

21:45.437 --> 21:47.204
Bring us back something,
would you?

21:47.205 --> 21:49.705
That's the plan.

22:24.576 --> 22:26.877
Are you picking this up?

22:26.878 --> 22:29.378
Yeah.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.948
The mike's hot.

22:37.756 --> 22:40.024
Do you have anything
bigger than this?

22:40.025 --> 22:42.525
Back there maybe?

22:48.033 --> 22:50.968
I don't understand you.
Don't understand you.

22:56.508 --> 22:59.008
The meet just got here.

23:05.784 --> 23:08.912
Got him.
Mochtar, you know this guy?

23:08.987 --> 23:11.854
No, but I'm gonna try
and get an I.D. Right now.

23:28.774 --> 23:30.207
<i>Bonjour.</i>

23:32.377 --> 23:34.678
Nice to finally
meet you in person.

23:34.679 --> 23:37.179
Everything work smoothly
getting here?

23:37.249 --> 23:39.450
Yes, thank you. Yes.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.118
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

23:41.119 --> 23:43.619
<i>Merci.</i>

23:45.757 --> 23:47.691
So, how are we doing?

23:47.692 --> 23:49.860
- You mean, phase three?
- What were the results?

23:49.861 --> 23:51.929
You will be very happy.

23:51.930 --> 23:52.696
Good.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.832
If Patel's going to be
our delivery man,

23:54.833 --> 23:56.500
I'll need the piece
by tomorrow.

23:56.501 --> 23:59.061
As long as the financial
arrangements can be made,

23:59.171 --> 24:01.671
that shouldn't be a problem.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.340
<i>Bon. Salud.</i>

24:08.613 --> 24:09.847
Damn it.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.816
The little guy's bodyguard.
I know him.

24:11.817 --> 24:12.983
What?

24:12.984 --> 24:14.151
From Corsica two years ago.

24:14.152 --> 24:17.019
The son of a bitch
broke my arm.

24:27.999 --> 24:30.593
Mochtar, pack up.
We've got to get out of here.

24:34.372 --> 24:36.872
We have somebody.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.518
What's happening?

24:47.519 --> 24:50.019
Syd, get out of there.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.327
You.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.461
I know you.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.962
I'm sorry.
You're talking to me?

25:00.031 --> 25:02.795
I think
you remember me, too.

25:10.742 --> 25:13.734
I'm sorry.
I don't know who you are.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.345
Tell me why you're here.

25:17.415 --> 25:19.650
Or this time...

25:19.651 --> 25:22.151
I do more
than just break your arm.

25:48.079 --> 25:50.980
He wanted to charge me $50.
It's too much.

26:08.433 --> 26:09.733
Dixon!

26:09.734 --> 26:11.001
Dixon!

26:11.002 --> 26:13.502
Dixon, do you copy?

26:24.282 --> 26:26.782
Dixon!

26:47.172 --> 26:49.206
Are you okay?

26:49.207 --> 26:50.808
I'm fine.

27:15.867 --> 27:18.367
We have to go.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.295
Hey.

27:45.296 --> 27:46.463
Hi.

27:46.464 --> 27:48.964
How was your trip?

27:49.668 --> 27:51.902
- It was awful.
- Syd, I'm sorry.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.137
What's going on with Charlie?

27:53.138 --> 27:55.698
I'm meeting him for coffee.

27:55.807 --> 27:57.775
He knows something's up.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.009
If he doesn't have
an excuse,

27:59.010 --> 28:02.776
if he can't explain exactly
why he was kissing some whore

28:02.847 --> 28:05.315
instead of going to Law Review,
I'm gonna kill him.

28:05.316 --> 28:06.550
Don't say that.

28:06.551 --> 28:08.619
She's on a rampage.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.220
She wasn't even gonna
go out with him.

28:10.221 --> 28:12.022
I had to force her
to call him. Hi.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.491
Hi.

28:14.492 --> 28:16.992
Let me ask you something.

28:17.629 --> 28:20.189
You think
it's gonna go all right?

28:22.267 --> 28:24.767
I do.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.011
Love you.

28:34.012 --> 28:35.612
Love you.

28:35.613 --> 28:37.047
See you, Will.

28:37.048 --> 28:39.548
Good luck.
Let me get that for you.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.051
Thanks.

28:43.188 --> 28:44.588
You look exhausted.

28:44.589 --> 28:47.089
Pretty good assessment.

28:48.226 --> 28:51.662
So, hey, I was thinking
about what happened.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.564
You know...

28:53.565 --> 28:56.033
That, uh...
you know, that kiss.

28:56.034 --> 28:57.034
Yeah.

28:57.035 --> 29:01.199
And, uh, I think I've figured
out why it was so weird.

29:01.306 --> 29:02.072
Why?

29:02.073 --> 29:04.541
Well, because...

29:04.542 --> 29:08.774
How often do you kiss someone
that you're that close to?

29:08.847 --> 29:11.347
Never.

29:12.250 --> 29:15.048
Anyway, I, uh...

29:15.120 --> 29:18.317
I know that it's awkward
between us now, but...

29:20.225 --> 29:22.226
I think that
I've figured out a way

29:22.227 --> 29:26.095
for it not to be
so awkward anymore.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.664
What?

29:39.511 --> 29:42.011
Okay, that didn't work,
did it?

29:42.046 --> 29:44.546
I have to go have dinner
with my father.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.950
Ooh.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.613
- I feel like an idiot.
- No, don't. Don't.

29:49.687 --> 29:51.889
Oh, my God,
I have that feel...

29:51.890 --> 29:54.390
Oh, my God.

30:03.434 --> 30:05.602
Would you like
to order, ma'am?

30:05.603 --> 30:08.504
I'll wait, thanks.
I'm meeting someone.

30:19.784 --> 30:22.284
Thank you.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.888
Thank you.

30:30.295 --> 30:32.795
So, you gonna tell me
what's up?

30:34.365 --> 30:36.733
Do I have to start guessing?

30:36.734 --> 30:38.168
I saw you.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.436
Saw me what?

30:39.437 --> 30:41.937
I saw you outside our house
with a woman.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.474
What are you doing?
Watching me?

30:44.475 --> 30:46.376
I don't have to answer that.
You do.

30:46.377 --> 30:47.411
What were you doing?

30:47.412 --> 30:48.412
She's a friend.

30:48.413 --> 30:51.280
A friend you went out with
instead of going to Law Review?

30:53.885 --> 30:56.086
Her name's Rachel, right?

30:56.087 --> 30:58.587
No.

31:00.358 --> 31:01.892
You know, I trust you.

31:01.893 --> 31:04.393
I give you reason to.

31:04.963 --> 31:08.797
I am not gonna let you
lie to me, Charlie.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.367
Now explain yourself.

31:12.437 --> 31:18.398
Francie, I love you.
And I'm not playing around.

31:18.509 --> 31:21.009
We're just hanging out.
That's all.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.879
All right, hang out.
Hang out with Rachel.

31:35.660 --> 31:40.154
<i># Spend all your time waiting #</i>

31:40.231 --> 31:43.325
<i># For that second chance #</i>

31:43.401 --> 31:48.361
<i># For a break
that would make it okay #</i>

31:48.473 --> 31:52.307
<i># There's always some reason #</i>

31:52.377 --> 31:55.574
<i># To feel not good enough #</i>

31:55.647 --> 32:00.550
<i># And it's hard
at the end of the day #</i>

32:00.618 --> 32:02.185
<i># I need some distraction #</i>

32:02.186 --> 32:03.553
Hello?

32:03.554 --> 32:04.988
Sorry to call so late.

32:04.989 --> 32:06.690
No, it's all right.

32:06.691 --> 32:08.458
I won't be able
to make dinner.

32:08.459 --> 32:12.361
Work is just, um,
I can't get away.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.031
You understand.

32:14.032 --> 32:15.198
Of course.

32:15.199 --> 32:17.699
Don't worry about it.

32:18.202 --> 32:20.702
I'll just see you at...

32:21.806 --> 32:24.306
I'll just see you.

32:24.342 --> 32:26.009
Okay.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.010
Bye.

32:27.011 --> 32:32.278
<i># In the arms of the angels #</i>

32:32.350 --> 32:38.186
<i># Far away from here #</i>

32:38.256 --> 32:44.354
<i># From this dark,
cold hotel room #</i>

32:44.429 --> 32:50.629
<i># And the endlessness
that you fear #</i>

32:50.702 --> 32:56.538
<i># You are pulled
from the wreckage #</i>

32:56.607 --> 32:59.701
<i># Of your silent reverie #</i>

32:59.811 --> 33:01.678
I'm sorry to call you.

33:01.679 --> 33:04.546
I just didn't know
who else to call.

33:04.615 --> 33:07.482
My father and I were
supposed to have dinner tonight

33:07.552 --> 33:09.853
for the first time
since I was a kid.

33:09.854 --> 33:12.354
I can't even remember
the last time.

33:16.394 --> 33:20.091
He just didn't show.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.827
He said he had work,
and he didn't have work.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.703
This isn't just about my dad.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.107
When I was in Morocco,
the man who died...

33:30.108 --> 33:31.608
He was a friend of mine.

33:31.609 --> 33:34.109
He was a good man...

33:34.178 --> 33:36.346
who thought he was fighting
for the right side,

33:36.347 --> 33:38.682
that he was working
for the CIA.

33:38.683 --> 33:42.517
He was lied to.
Now he's dead.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.951
I had his blood
on my hands.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.025
Sydney.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.620
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.195
Like I don't even know
who I am anymore

33:53.231 --> 33:57.827
or what I'm doing
or why I'm doing it.

33:59.404 --> 34:04.000
<i># It's easier to believe #</i>

34:04.108 --> 34:05.976
<i># And this sweet madness #</i>

34:09.313 --> 34:11.614
You just threw your beeper
in the Pacific.

34:14.819 --> 34:17.319
I know.

34:17.855 --> 34:20.355
Listen. There's something
you need to know.

34:22.527 --> 34:25.027
When you first walked
into my office

34:25.029 --> 34:29.898
with that stupid Bozo hair...

34:29.967 --> 34:31.134
I thought you were crazy.

34:31.135 --> 34:35.071
I actually thought you might
have been a crazy person.

34:35.139 --> 34:40.509
But I watched you.
I read your statement.

34:40.578 --> 34:45.174
I've seen how you think.
I've seen how you work.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.217
I've seen who you are.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.348
In this job, you see darkness.
You see the worst in people.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.494
And though the jobs
are different

34:57.495 --> 34:59.563
and the missions change

34:59.564 --> 35:02.965
and the enemies
have a thousand names...

35:03.034 --> 35:04.468
the one crucial thing,

35:04.469 --> 35:06.536
the one real
responsibility you have,

35:06.537 --> 35:09.973
is to not let your rage
and your resentment

35:10.074 --> 35:12.574
and your disgust darken you.

35:15.847 --> 35:18.115
When you're at
your absolute lowest,

35:18.116 --> 35:19.749
at your most depressed,

35:19.750 --> 35:24.016
just... remember
that you can always...

35:24.088 --> 35:26.089
you know...

35:26.090 --> 35:28.590
you got my number.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.408
I put the recording you made
through voice print.

35:52.483 --> 35:54.751
The man that Jacqnoud
is meeting with

35:54.752 --> 35:56.386
is Malik Suari.

35:56.387 --> 35:59.015
He specializes
in industrial demolition.

35:59.090 --> 36:00.957
This is his latest innovation.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.326
It's called the BLU-250.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.028
Commissioned by
a Swiss corporation

36:05.029 --> 36:06.930
to blow out mountain ranges

36:06.931 --> 36:09.431
for the production
of high-speed trains.

36:09.467 --> 36:11.067
There's a third piece.

36:11.068 --> 36:12.769
You will be very happy.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.037
Good.

36:14.038 --> 36:15.505
If Patel's going to be
our delivery man,

36:15.506 --> 36:17.207
I'll need
the piece by tomorrow.

36:17.208 --> 36:20.905
The man they're referring to
is Dhiren Patel.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.646
You think the winner
of the Edgar Peace Prize

36:22.647 --> 36:24.014
is working with Luc Jacqnoud?

36:24.015 --> 36:26.515
Dhiren Patel is India's
delegate to the U.N.

36:26.551 --> 36:27.484
He's a former president

36:27.485 --> 36:29.553
of the Southern Hemisphere
Human Rights Commission.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.721
There is no way
he's working with Jacqnoud.

36:31.722 --> 36:33.256
What's the connection?

36:33.257 --> 36:34.691
Irony.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.760
Jacqnoud is using Mr. Patel
without his knowledge

36:36.761 --> 36:38.628
to send a message
to the U.C.O.

36:38.629 --> 36:39.629
Which is what?

36:39.630 --> 36:41.364
To abolish the organization.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.133
We've traced at least
half a dozen threats

36:43.134 --> 36:44.935
to Jacqnoud.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.903
This has it
that this last act

36:46.904 --> 36:49.404
will be his most violent yet.

36:49.507 --> 36:51.241
You think Jacqnoud
is going to plant

36:51.242 --> 36:52.309
an explosive on Patel.

36:52.310 --> 36:54.711
Yes, I do, and I want
you two to stop it.

36:54.712 --> 36:58.011
That's why you're leaving
for Sao Paulo tonight.

36:58.082 --> 36:59.749
The job is to find Patel,

36:59.750 --> 37:02.085
recover the weapon,
and safeguard the U.C.O.

37:02.086 --> 37:04.586
Any questions?

37:26.210 --> 37:27.944
Any luck?

37:27.945 --> 37:30.445
I don't see Patel anywhere.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.050
Oh, and that's unusual,

37:34.051 --> 37:36.576
buying an international
flight with cash?

37:36.654 --> 37:39.555
Uh-huh. But he was
traveling alone, right?

37:39.624 --> 37:41.925
Excuse me?

37:41.926 --> 37:44.426
Daniel Hecht was not
traveling alone?

37:51.068 --> 37:52.669
I have a 20 on Patel.

37:52.670 --> 37:55.170
Let's get him out of here.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.945
Wait. Something's wrong.
He looks sick.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.446
Sick?

38:04.448 --> 38:05.749
He just went down.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.378
- Does he have a drink?
- Yes.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.952
Get the glass.

38:12.757 --> 38:14.724
Is he okay?

38:14.725 --> 38:16.626
- Did somebody call a doctor?
- Excuse me.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.127
I'm a doctor.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.797
Can I help?

38:34.178 --> 38:35.545
Guess who's here.

38:35.546 --> 38:38.046
Suari.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.614
If they're bombing this place,
it's gonna be tomorrow.

38:41.686 --> 38:43.720
Opening ceremonies.

38:43.721 --> 38:46.690
Oh, they fed Patel some kind
of powdered sedative compound.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.560
Looks like a designer drug.

38:54.098 --> 38:56.598
Keep an eye on Suari.

39:00.037 --> 39:02.537
I'm following Patel.

39:03.941 --> 39:05.375
Just confirm something
for me.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.177
The person traveling
with Daniel Hecht...

39:07.178 --> 39:08.878
the name was Sydney Bristow,
right?

39:08.879 --> 39:10.980
No? Are you sure?

39:10.981 --> 39:13.283
Okay, you gotta tell me
who it was.

39:13.284 --> 39:14.951
Just give me the name.

39:14.952 --> 39:18.080
Oh, come on. What about,
"You owe me one"?

39:18.155 --> 39:21.591
All right. You remember
my assistant, Jenny?

39:21.659 --> 39:23.560
No, no.
The other one.

39:23.561 --> 39:26.291
- What are you doing?
- Yes. Yes, yes.

39:26.364 --> 39:28.331
You give me the name,
and she'll go out with you.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.233
No, she won't.
No, she's not.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.237
You don't have to go out
with him. Just say you are.

39:34.305 --> 39:36.805
- Please.
- Fine.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.242
Hi.

39:39.243 --> 39:41.378
Yeah. Okay.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.973
I'd love to go out with you.
Uh-huh.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.283
Okay?
So give me the name.

39:48.352 --> 39:51.549
The person who was traveling
with Daniel Hecht.

39:51.622 --> 39:54.122
Yeah, I know.

39:55.593 --> 39:58.093
Kate Jones.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.962
Kate Jones.

40:46.477 --> 40:47.944
There was a problem?

40:47.945 --> 40:50.445
No problem. No.
He's ready to go.

41:07.264 --> 41:09.764
Sponge.

41:15.539 --> 41:18.039
Scalpel.

42:57.675 --> 42:59.375
Uh, careful with that.

42:59.376 --> 43:03.039
That's the equivalent
of 300 pounds of TNT.

43:03.113 --> 43:05.613
Yes, don't kill us.
