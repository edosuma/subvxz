00:57.050 --> 00:59.380
"Invisible
Traces"?

00:59.382 --> 01:01.838
I like that, it sounds
promising.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.629
Like an exciting
take on the subject.

01:04.632 --> 01:05.838
I'm really looking forward to

01:05.840 --> 01:07.425
the results of your work, Piet.

01:08.507 --> 01:11.588
And, just between the two of us,

01:11.590 --> 01:14.590
I haven't met many students
with such high potential.

01:16.507 --> 01:18.255
Thank you,
Mr. Karadimos.

01:18.257 --> 01:20.130
But don't
get cocky about it.

01:20.132 --> 01:21.546
It's still going to
take you a while

01:21.548 --> 01:24.173
to make this into a solid paper.

01:24.175 --> 01:25.090
Yes, sir.

01:26.465 --> 01:29.132
Well,
got to go, keep it up.

02:36.965 --> 02:38.463
Excuse me.

02:38.465 --> 02:39.300
Excuse me!

02:44.007 --> 02:45.757
Are you Piet Carnell?

02:53.840 --> 02:55.380
Milk, sugar?

02:55.382 --> 02:56.340
Black, thank you.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.465
"Invisible Traces"?

03:07.382 --> 03:09.548
It's the paper I
wrote with Klara.

03:09.550 --> 03:11.382
I know, I read it.

03:13.132 --> 03:14.505
You did?

03:14.507 --> 03:15.340
I liked it.

03:16.965 --> 03:19.338
Did you come up with the title?

03:19.340 --> 03:20.175
Yes, I did.

03:25.050 --> 03:26.675
How can I help you, Miss Stantz?

03:28.590 --> 03:29.715
This is a good start.

03:32.757 --> 03:35.923
You know, I already talked
to the police several times.

03:35.925 --> 03:37.425
I don't work for the police.

03:38.882 --> 03:40.005
You don't?

03:40.007 --> 03:40.840
No.

03:42.007 --> 03:43.425
I didn't care for it much.

03:46.175 --> 03:48.132
So, why are you here?

03:50.090 --> 03:51.925
I work for Klara's family.

03:57.757 --> 04:00.715
What exactly can I do for you?

04:04.300 --> 04:05.755
From what I learned, you were

04:05.757 --> 04:07.965
the one who reported
Klara missing.

04:09.090 --> 04:12.463
And you said that
you had nothing to do

04:12.465 --> 04:15.048
with her disappearance
or the state

04:15.050 --> 04:17.800
of her body when it reappeared.

04:20.675 --> 04:21.675
That's correct.

04:23.340 --> 04:27.800
Stop me now if
what I say upsets you,

04:29.300 --> 04:31.632
but I'm having
trouble believing that.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.131
Good morning,
Mr. Piet.

05:21.133 --> 05:21.963
How are you doing today?

05:21.965 --> 05:23.173
Morning.

05:23.175 --> 05:27.006
So, today you have two from
Horizon, one from Heaven.

05:27.008 --> 05:27.963
Right.

05:27.965 --> 05:29.882
And the regular
shopping delivery.

05:31.675 --> 05:32.590
Sign here, please.

05:37.508 --> 05:38.383
Something missing?

05:39.675 --> 05:40.633
My sushi?

05:41.840 --> 05:44.256
Oh, right,
sushi set A.

05:44.258 --> 05:45.798
Yeah, that's my lunch.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.463
Oh, I'm sorry
about that.

05:48.465 --> 05:50.506
Here, mark the missing item on

05:50.508 --> 05:52.383
this form and it'll be refunded.

05:53.550 --> 05:54.633
Could you go get it?

05:55.465 --> 05:57.757
I'm sorry, man, I don't
think I can do that.

06:24.633 --> 06:27.588
What this invocation
does is the following.

06:27.590 --> 06:32.550
It binds X to 144,

06:33.633 --> 06:36.300
but this binding,
this binding is local.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.506
- Meaning it only holds...
- Hi!

06:39.508 --> 06:41.713
Within the
confines of the code.

06:41.715 --> 06:42.925
Hi, excuse me.

06:44.340 --> 06:45.675
Are you Piet Carnell?

06:47.175 --> 06:49.713
- Yes, how do you...
- May I?

06:49.715 --> 06:51.463
It won't take long, I promise.

06:51.465 --> 06:53.673
I'm looking for a partner
for the term paper

06:53.675 --> 06:56.588
and Professor Karadimos told
me that you were available.

06:56.590 --> 06:57.423
Yeah?

06:57.425 --> 06:58.713
Yes,
I would love it if...

06:58.715 --> 07:03.463
No, um, uh, no, I
really need to get going.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.588
Of course!

07:04.590 --> 07:07.631
- For some, I have...
- So, what about the project?

07:07.633 --> 07:10.006
Yeah, I think you have
the wrong information

07:10.008 --> 07:12.131
because I already
have a partner.

07:12.133 --> 07:14.381
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

07:14.383 --> 07:16.550
Maybe another time
and have a nice day.

07:25.925 --> 07:28.131
Hello, Mr. Spengler.

07:28.133 --> 07:29.923
Right on time for
our little private chat.

07:29.925 --> 07:31.713
How are you doing, sweetheart?

07:31.715 --> 07:33.300
I'm fine, thank you.

07:35.008 --> 07:36.425
How do you like my outfit?

07:38.425 --> 07:39.425
Not too much?

07:40.633 --> 07:43.048
'Cause I know you like it
more casual, don't you?

07:43.050 --> 07:43.925
Sometimes.

07:46.008 --> 07:49.088
Alright, what
do you feel like today?

07:49.090 --> 07:52.588
You want me to show you
my new high heels?

07:52.590 --> 07:53.425
Sounds good.

07:54.675 --> 07:55.963
They're super fancy.

07:55.965 --> 07:59.506
I'll be right back.

08:09.758 --> 08:11.008
Who's there?

08:16.590 --> 08:17.507
Hi, Piet.

08:18.508 --> 08:19.338
Hey.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.548
Sorry for being so pushy.

08:21.550 --> 08:24.258
I kind of had the feeling
that I scared you off.

08:26.675 --> 08:28.508
What can I help you with?

08:29.715 --> 08:33.381
I read your last paper
and I thought it was great.

08:33.383 --> 08:35.173
So, if it's a possibility,

08:35.174 --> 08:37.090
I would really like
to work with you.

08:38.340 --> 08:39.549
You read my paper?

08:40.758 --> 08:41.673
What can I say?

08:41.674 --> 08:42.712
It's really good,

08:42.715 --> 08:44.965
especially your
counter-thesis to Ian Clark.

08:46.883 --> 08:47.716
Thank you.

08:48.716 --> 08:51.880
Um, you know, I already
have a partner, so...

08:51.882 --> 08:54.214
Look, I'm the new kid
and you don't know me,

08:54.216 --> 08:56.047
but I'm a fast learner.

08:56.049 --> 08:58.424
And I promise you won't
regret working with me.

09:06.882 --> 09:11.882
♪ I'll make the sunshine's
rays hot for you ♪

09:13.882 --> 09:15.339
♪ Every night ♪

09:15.341 --> 09:18.214
So, you do
classification of data sources.

09:18.216 --> 09:19.755
Okay.

09:19.757 --> 09:20.630
Alright.

09:20.632 --> 09:24.590
And chapter three,
the ghost machine?

09:25.425 --> 09:26.550
I'll do that.

09:27.550 --> 09:28.757
Okay, but what is it?

09:30.632 --> 09:32.590
It's part of
a theory of mine.

09:34.050 --> 09:35.425
Can you explain it to me?

09:38.591 --> 09:40.050
Okay, um...

09:41.632 --> 09:45.925
Imagine you, um, you had a tool

09:46.966 --> 09:51.966
that was able to move through
the internet like a ghost.

09:54.466 --> 09:57.130
Like a covert by proxy?

09:57.132 --> 09:58.382
Even more than that.

09:59.716 --> 10:03.464
Think IC reach,
just more powerful.

10:03.466 --> 10:07.048
You'd be able to access
everybody's accounts;

10:07.050 --> 10:11.132
banks, emails, social networks.

10:11.966 --> 10:13.214
Even beyond that you'd be able

10:13.216 --> 10:15.964
to access anybody's
computer, look inside

10:15.966 --> 10:19.298
their computer's hard drive
as if it was your own.

10:19.300 --> 10:24.132
The interesting question is;
if you had a tool like this

10:25.841 --> 10:28.216
and nobody knew about
it, would you use it?

10:30.800 --> 10:33.716
I guess everybody would
at least take a peek, right?

10:34.800 --> 10:37.423
But we both agree
this would be wrong?

10:37.425 --> 10:38.800
This would be a wrongdoing?

10:41.175 --> 10:42.589
Alright, so?

10:42.591 --> 10:47.050
So, the question is;
if getting away with it

10:48.007 --> 10:53.007
determines whether or not you're
gonna do something immoral.

10:56.091 --> 10:58.089
Well, I guess it's true,

10:58.091 --> 11:00.505
but it's not exactly
informatics.

11:00.507 --> 11:02.505
Why do you think this
should be in the paper?

11:02.507 --> 11:05.548
Because the entire
idea of digital traces

11:05.550 --> 11:08.423
comes with moral issues,
either for the one who collects

11:08.425 --> 11:11.007
the traces or the one
who leaves them behind.

11:12.675 --> 11:15.589
Control over traces
equals a lot of power.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.548
And the potential power
of a ghost machine

11:17.550 --> 11:20.673
would make anybody
feel untouchable,

11:20.675 --> 11:22.925
hence allowing them to act
immoral.

11:24.382 --> 11:28.382
But a wrongdoing, a
wrongdoing is a wrongdoing.

11:29.841 --> 11:33.883
Even though you had the
guarantee to get away with it.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.966
Piet, may I ask you
something personal?

11:40.425 --> 11:41.257
Okay.

11:42.675 --> 11:46.175
You are a great
guy and really smart.

11:47.175 --> 11:49.716
How come you hide
yourself away like this?

11:50.632 --> 11:52.215
I've never seen you in class.

11:54.757 --> 11:58.089
I just don't feel
comfortable around people.

11:58.091 --> 11:58.923
But how come?

11:58.925 --> 12:00.591
You don't seem
uncomfortable now.

12:02.257 --> 12:03.257
Well, I'm not now.

12:07.716 --> 12:08.923
Should we continue?

12:08.925 --> 12:11.300
It's a little strange
talking about this.

12:13.257 --> 12:17.255
Well, you know, I'm not
your advisor or anything,

12:17.257 --> 12:20.257
but maybe you should
challenge yourself a little?

12:41.050 --> 12:42.382
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:44.216 --> 12:46.880
Is the lasagna good today?

12:46.882 --> 12:48.050
Excuse me?

12:48.966 --> 12:51.380
Would the lasagna be
a good choice today?

12:51.382 --> 12:52.800
I don't eat here.

12:54.091 --> 12:54.925
Oh.

12:57.466 --> 13:00.133
That's a lovely shirt.

13:02.757 --> 13:04.714
That's the uniform.

13:04.716 --> 13:05.966
Everybody wears it.

13:09.050 --> 13:10.130
Right.

13:14.216 --> 13:15.050
Yeah.

13:18.591 --> 13:19.425
Yeah.

13:58.507 --> 14:00.505
Fourth floor.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.089
Door opening.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.630
Wait a minute.

14:03.632 --> 14:04.800
You like her, don't you?

14:05.716 --> 14:06.548
No.

14:07.382 --> 14:08.464
You're such a bad liar.

14:08.466 --> 14:09.714
What's her name?

14:09.716 --> 14:10.714
Why do you care?

14:10.716 --> 14:11.548
Come on, Piet.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.214
- What's her name?
- Klara.

14:14.216 --> 14:15.464
Now we're talking.

14:15.466 --> 14:17.383
So when can I meet
your new girlfriend?

14:18.841 --> 14:19.839
Piet!

14:19.841 --> 14:21.714
I wish I hadn't told you.

14:21.716 --> 14:23.508
No, you did the right thing.

14:24.507 --> 14:26.505
It's good to talk to your
friends about shit like that.

14:26.507 --> 14:27.880
So, how far did you get?

14:27.882 --> 14:30.300
Come on, did you
make out, hold hands?

14:33.841 --> 14:34.925
So nothing happened?

14:36.716 --> 14:40.548
It's just we get along
really, really great.

14:40.550 --> 14:41.798
You know?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.341
That's, that's good.

14:46.341 --> 14:50.589
It's just, it's just I
don't know how to, um...

14:50.591 --> 14:54.464
I don't know how to get
it, you know, to, um...

14:54.466 --> 14:55.383
Make a move.

14:57.257 --> 14:58.339
What?

14:58.341 --> 15:03.008
You need to, uh, establish
a physical connection.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.214
But, it's not like that.

15:07.216 --> 15:08.425
It is like that.

15:09.425 --> 15:11.214
Don't you think that would be

15:11.216 --> 15:12.880
a little aggressive
with the project?

15:12.882 --> 15:14.173
Forget about the project.

15:14.175 --> 15:16.255
Everybody knows you don't
need any help on this.

15:16.257 --> 15:18.130
You need more game.

15:18.132 --> 15:21.215
So if you ever wanna have sex,
then you gotta make a move.

15:24.550 --> 15:25.382
Thanks.

15:32.257 --> 15:33.798
Are you alright, Piet?

15:33.800 --> 15:34.632
Yeah.

15:36.966 --> 15:39.464
You seem a bit tense.

15:39.466 --> 15:41.133
No, I'm fine.

15:46.675 --> 15:51.632
Well, actually I feel
a bit tense myself.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.800
Should we take a break?

15:56.675 --> 15:58.173
Shouldn't we just
finish this first?

15:58.175 --> 16:00.048
Relax, it's almost done.

16:00.050 --> 16:01.300
Let's sit for a while.

16:02.632 --> 16:03.465
And...

16:06.132 --> 16:07.340
I brought you something.

16:10.341 --> 16:11.175
Oh.

16:26.757 --> 16:28.507
That's great stuff.

16:35.132 --> 16:37.132
Where do you
want to go in life, Piet?

16:41.966 --> 16:43.008
You're gonna laugh.

16:44.882 --> 16:47.798
But I want to make the
world a better place.

16:50.925 --> 16:52.548
Like Jesus?

16:52.550 --> 16:55.630
No, not like Jesus.

16:55.632 --> 16:57.715
Like, uh...

17:00.132 --> 17:02.550
Like a modern day Robinhood.

17:03.675 --> 17:05.964
A Robinhood who never
leaves Sherwood Forest.

17:05.965 --> 17:07.880
That would work, yeah.

17:07.882 --> 17:08.964
You're full of shit.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.505
What about you?

17:17.507 --> 17:18.839
Mother Superior?

17:21.049 --> 17:23.464
Believe it or not,
I have no clue.

17:24.508 --> 17:29.133
Before I got into informatics
I was into all kinds of stuff;

17:30.258 --> 17:33.633
traveling, music, architecture.

17:35.465 --> 17:37.881
Why didn't you
study any of that?

17:37.883 --> 17:39.799
I guess I didn't
have a real passion.

17:41.383 --> 17:45.088
All I know is,
whatever I'll end up doing,

17:45.090 --> 17:46.675
I won't be selling it cheap.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.258
For now, I'm just trying to
get the best CV possible.

17:52.758 --> 17:53.633
That's rational.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.007
Actually, it's a bit cynical.

17:58.090 --> 18:00.175
But it's a cynical
world out there.

18:02.925 --> 18:05.590
Why do you think I never
leave the Sherwood Forest?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.340
What do you live off, anyway?

18:14.715 --> 18:16.465
- Do you have a scholarship?
- No.

18:18.008 --> 18:18.841
I have money.

18:20.550 --> 18:21.425
Where from?

18:23.090 --> 18:25.382
From the company
I sold last year.

18:32.550 --> 18:34.088
It's true.

18:34.090 --> 18:36.465
It's true, I had a small
company and I sold it.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.300
It's not a joke,
it's not a joke.

18:41.258 --> 18:42.758
Hey, that's a good track.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.175
I didn't know that you were
into this kind of music.

18:48.925 --> 18:52.715
Well, when I was a teenager,

18:54.340 --> 18:57.257
my mother, she sent me to a
language school in England.

18:58.758 --> 19:03.548
And I had a Jamaican roommate
and we would smoke weed

19:03.550 --> 19:07.048
and listen to Roxy Music
all day long.

19:07.050 --> 19:08.173
Really?

19:08.175 --> 19:09.298
Wow!

19:09.300 --> 19:13.340
- Yeah, no.
- Hey, you!

19:20.758 --> 19:22.048
That'd be cool.

19:22.050 --> 19:26.756

Goodnight, sleep tight.

21:05.508 --> 21:07.131
Oh, good morning.

21:07.133 --> 21:10.550
Good morning to you, too.

21:11.465 --> 21:13.798
I completely
passed out.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.963
I hope the sofa wasn't
too uncomfortable.

21:16.965 --> 21:19.088
No, no, I'll live.

21:19.090 --> 21:20.506
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

21:20.508 --> 21:22.631
I gotta go and feed the birds.

21:22.633 --> 21:23.673
The birds?

21:23.675 --> 21:25.840
Yeah, two budgies.

21:26.675 --> 21:28.715
My mom hates them so
I took them with me.

21:30.508 --> 21:31.383
That's nice.

21:32.925 --> 21:37.588
Well, it was a
fun project with you.

21:37.590 --> 21:38.800
I enjoyed it a lot.

21:40.050 --> 21:40.883
Me, too.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.798
Yeah.

21:43.800 --> 21:44.758
Don't be stupid.

21:47.550 --> 21:49.173
Let's hang out sometime.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.506
Yeah.

21:50.508 --> 21:52.175
- Oh, uh, Klara, Klara?
- Yeah?

21:53.008 --> 21:57.006
Maybe now that we're finished
with the paper and all,

21:57.008 --> 22:01.506
um, I was thinking maybe
you, we could have,

22:01.508 --> 22:04.713
um, a dinner on Saturday?

22:04.715 --> 22:06.881
- Yeah, lovely, sure.
- Yeah?

22:06.883 --> 22:09.131
Why don't you come
over to my place for a change?

22:09.133 --> 22:09.963
Yeah?

22:09.965 --> 22:11.006
Yeah.

22:11.008 --> 22:11.925

Wow, look at you!

22:55.965 --> 22:57.882
Uh, I brought wine.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.006
Tempranillo.

23:01.008 --> 23:03.756
- From Catalonia.
- I know, fantastico!

23:03.758 --> 23:05.006
Well, come in.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.383
- You like red wine, right?
- Yes, I love it.

23:08.675 --> 23:10.256
Make yourself comfortable.

23:10.258 --> 23:12.216
I gotta finish this really
quick.

23:13.425 --> 23:15.383
- Before we get to the wine.
- Okay.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.963
So that's what
you use that for?

23:30.965 --> 23:32.423
Handy, ain't it?

23:32.425 --> 23:34.465
Yeah, I don't think
I ever used mine.

23:35.715 --> 23:38.963
On the one hand, she's
like my best friend,

23:38.965 --> 23:42.381
but on the other hand, oh,
my God, she's no needy!

23:42.383 --> 23:44.963
And, you know, I feel
kind of bad seeing her.

23:44.965 --> 23:45.800
I feel annoyed.

23:47.090 --> 23:48.338
I know I shouldn't say that.

23:48.340 --> 23:49.588
- I know it.
- No, no, no!

23:49.590 --> 23:51.881
I totally get it,
my mom's the same.

23:51.883 --> 23:54.256
Yeah, she lives less
than an hour from here.

23:54.258 --> 23:55.548
- Really?
- Really, and she didn't want

23:55.550 --> 23:58.383
me to go because she said
she was worried about me.

24:00.883 --> 24:04.383
I wish she would just,
I don't know,

24:06.215 --> 24:09.131
screw the mailman or something.

24:10.508 --> 24:12.423
It's actually not funny.

24:12.425 --> 24:14.008
Yes, it kind of is.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.300
You are a fun guy.

24:20.215 --> 24:21.463
Where are you going?

24:21.465 --> 24:22.798
We need more drinks.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.925
Okay, keep 'em coming.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.300
This stuff is the best.

24:31.215 --> 24:32.798
What is it?

24:32.800 --> 24:35.548
It's my favorite
Polish vodka.

24:35.550 --> 24:36.838
Okay.

24:36.840 --> 24:37.965
Polish vodka.

24:39.175 --> 24:41.090
Let's drink Bruderschaft.

24:41.925 --> 24:43.838
Bruderschaft, what?

24:43.840 --> 24:48.673
It means brotherhood in
German and it goes like this.

24:48.675 --> 24:50.631
- Now, bottom's up!
- Oh, all of it?

24:50.633 --> 24:51.675
Yes, quickly.

24:54.758 --> 24:55.591
Now kiss.

What?

25:13.675 --> 25:14.550
Oh!

25:15.590 --> 25:16.425
What?

25:17.508 --> 25:19.675
I never
thought of you like that.

25:20.675 --> 25:21.508
Like what?

25:22.550 --> 25:26.715
You know, like as a
man I could sleep with.

25:32.715 --> 25:33.882
Hey, Piet.

25:35.215 --> 25:36.798
Hey!

25:36.800 --> 25:38.215
It's not a big deal.

25:39.340 --> 25:40.840
Oh, um, I, uh...

25:43.883 --> 25:44.716
Piet!

25:46.383 --> 25:48.091
Look, I didn't mean
it like that.

25:49.550 --> 25:50.800
I have to go.

25:51.883 --> 25:53.298
Piet, look, I'm...

25:53.300 --> 25:55.213
I'm, I go, I'm going.

25:55.215 --> 25:57.173
But, listen...

25:57.175 --> 25:58.675
I, uh, don't.

26:35.215 --> 26:37.590
You have four messages.

26:40.508 --> 26:45.048
Hey, can you
please call me back?

26:45.050 --> 26:47.590
I left my jacket at
your place and,

26:48.633 --> 26:52.881
well, I really think
we should talk.

26:52.883 --> 26:53.716
Bye.

26:57.090 --> 26:58.713
Piet,
Karadimos speaking.

26:58.715 --> 27:01.256
I've just finished reading
"Invisible Traces".

27:01.258 --> 27:02.298
And what can I say?

27:02.300 --> 27:03.963
It is brilliant.

27:03.965 --> 27:05.381
A little heavy on
the moral side,

27:05.383 --> 27:07.966
but altogether a great
job by you and your team.

27:08.925 --> 27:10.963
And, by the way, I'm
also happy to see that

27:10.965 --> 27:13.963
you seem to get along with
Miss Koslowski so well.

27:13.965 --> 27:17.423
I was...

27:17.425 --> 27:19.588
Okay,
you didn't fuck her.

27:19.590 --> 27:20.465
So what?

27:21.925 --> 27:23.588
I mean, it's a big world out
there, man.

27:23.590 --> 27:25.506
It doesn't make sense to
cry about one individual.

27:25.508 --> 27:26.423
I mean, think about it.

27:26.425 --> 27:28.173
You need some distraction, man.

27:28.175 --> 27:30.215
You gotta lift yourself
out of this hole.

27:35.925 --> 27:38.173
I got it!

27:38.175 --> 27:39.838
Jean, the French guy, you know?

27:39.840 --> 27:42.840
He knows that one call girl
that's into nerds, it's perfect!

27:44.465 --> 27:45.298
Fuck.

27:45.300 --> 27:46.506
Hello, Mr. Spengler.

27:46.508 --> 27:47.338
It's been a while.

27:47.340 --> 27:49.256
Did you miss me?

27:49.258 --> 27:50.175
A little.

27:51.758 --> 27:53.506
Just a little?

27:53.508 --> 27:55.173
Are you okay?

27:55.175 --> 27:56.300
Don't ask.

27:57.508 --> 27:58.673
Okay, sure.

27:58.675 --> 28:00.298
So, what do you feel like today?

28:00.300 --> 28:02.508
Look, I put the
casual clothes on again.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.591
Take your clothes off.

28:08.090 --> 28:09.007
Straightforward.

28:14.675 --> 28:15.758
Do you like lingerie?

28:18.258 --> 28:19.216
Take it off.

28:22.175 --> 28:24.006
Is that really you, Spengler?

28:24.008 --> 28:25.716
Yeah,
of course, it's me.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.338
Since when did you
become such a naughty boy?

28:32.340 --> 28:33.465
Don't call me a boy.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.300
Um, sure, whatever.

28:41.550 --> 28:42.758
Take your clothes off.

28:54.175 --> 28:55.590
How do you like it?

28:57.425 --> 28:58.550
Spread your legs.

29:03.715 --> 29:04.550
Like this?

29:05.965 --> 29:07.338
Yeah, that's okay.

29:07.340 --> 29:08.840
Okay, what's next?

29:10.425 --> 29:14.298
You want me to play around
with myself or suck a dildo?

29:14.300 --> 29:15.633
Don't talk like that!

29:16.840 --> 29:19.048
Hey, come on,
what's wrong with you?

29:19.050 --> 29:21.048
Why are you acting so strange?

29:21.050 --> 29:22.423
Twist your nipples.

29:22.425 --> 29:23.588
No.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.463
Yeah, twist your nipples.

29:25.465 --> 29:27.713
No, I'm not doing this.

29:27.715 --> 29:29.340
This is not for pleasure
anymore.

29:31.175 --> 29:32.758
Or are you enjoying yourself?

29:34.215 --> 29:35.050
No.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.007
Why are you so angry?

29:42.675 --> 29:45.633
Are you having
some kind of trouble?

29:47.008 --> 29:47.841
Girl trouble?

29:51.425 --> 29:52.258
Spengler?

29:54.800 --> 29:55.633
Hey?

29:58.633 --> 29:59.675
Did someone hurt you?

30:04.465 --> 30:05.300
Fuck you.

31:29.175 --> 31:30.425
Piet?

31:45.258 --> 31:46.091
Piet?

31:48.800 --> 31:51.675
Hey, Piet, are you okay?

32:06.340 --> 32:07.507
Have you come to...

32:09.090 --> 32:11.715
The door wasn't locked
and I was worried about you.

32:20.090 --> 32:21.675
What do you want?

32:22.675 --> 32:25.590
I wanted to
tell you how sorry I am.

32:26.465 --> 32:28.257
I understand that
you're mad at me.

32:30.090 --> 32:31.675
What I said was horrible.

32:35.925 --> 32:37.463
Did you mean it?

32:37.465 --> 32:38.423
No!

32:38.425 --> 32:40.631
I mean, it's not that
I don't like you...

32:40.633 --> 32:43.423
That's not what
I'm talking about.

32:43.425 --> 32:44.258
Okay.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.675
Let me put it this way.

32:52.175 --> 32:56.756
To be honest,
at first I didn't think

32:56.758 --> 33:00.383
that I would ever really
like you, but I was wrong.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.300
You are a great guy.

33:05.465 --> 33:08.673
And, yeah, I even
have some feelings

33:08.675 --> 33:10.883
for you that I never
thought could exist.

33:12.675 --> 33:13.508
You do?

33:15.840 --> 33:20.548
Yeah, you know,
under different circumstances...

33:20.550 --> 33:22.838
What circumstances?

33:22.840 --> 33:25.673
Right now, you and
me don't make sense.

33:25.675 --> 33:27.131
Why not, why not?

33:27.133 --> 33:28.591
Don't you get the point?

33:30.715 --> 33:31.838
That I'm unfuckable.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.131
Jesus, Piet, I'm trying
to make peace with you!

33:34.133 --> 33:35.756
It's not my fault
that nobody found

33:35.758 --> 33:37.841
a way into your rat
cage to fuck you!

33:42.090 --> 33:44.675
God, I'm making
everything worse.

33:45.715 --> 33:46.550
May I?

33:50.715 --> 33:51.550
You...

33:56.590 --> 33:58.965
Well, maybe I
shouldn't have come.

34:00.633 --> 34:02.050
But I care for you, man!

34:04.425 --> 34:05.675
I care for you, too.

34:08.800 --> 34:09.632
Piet.

34:13.882 --> 34:15.675
We make a pretty good team.

34:18.925 --> 34:19.965
We do, yeah.

34:31.591 --> 34:32.924
Are you okay?

34:34.422 --> 34:35.465
Yeah, just...

34:38.257 --> 34:39.257
All of a sudden I...

34:41.966 --> 34:43.382
I feel very tired.

34:46.172 --> 34:49.047
Do you mind if I rest
my head for a minute?

34:51.007 --> 34:54.839
Don't you wanna
go to the big dance?

34:54.841 --> 34:56.091
Yeah, sure.

34:59.716 --> 35:02.258
Can you wake me up in five?

35:08.216 --> 35:09.049
Sure.

35:13.633 --> 35:14.466
Piet?

35:20.216 --> 35:21.216
Are we cool?

35:24.800 --> 35:28.425
Yeah, we're cool.

42:12.758 --> 42:15.258
Mr. Spengler, I didn't
expect you back so early.

42:16.841 --> 42:19.548
Well, can we go
into private chat?

42:19.550 --> 42:22.048
Mm-mm, you
know the schedule, honey.

42:22.050 --> 42:24.716
Right now it's happy
hour for all the dudes.

42:26.175 --> 42:27.383
I will pay you double.

42:28.383 --> 42:30.214
I can't do that.

42:30.216 --> 42:31.050
Triple.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.300
Well, I guess
it's pretty urgent.

42:35.550 --> 42:37.050
I just need 15 minutes.

42:41.466 --> 42:42.300
Please?

42:45.050 --> 42:46.589
Oops!

42:46.591 --> 42:48.089
Mrs. Baer is coming up with

42:48.091 --> 42:50.339
an all-new business
model tonight.

42:50.341 --> 42:53.089
Alright, I apologize,
but Eddie, Paradox,

42:53.091 --> 42:56.756
and everyone else, you'll
get a voucher for my website.

42:56.758 --> 42:59.425
Be back in 15 if you can
hold it that long, boys.

43:02.633 --> 43:03.466
Thank you.

43:12.550 --> 43:14.089
So what do you want?

43:14.091 --> 43:17.798
Listen, I apologize
for the other day.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.964
Yeah,
but what do you want?

43:19.966 --> 43:21.883
I need your advice.

43:24.091 --> 43:24.925
On what?

43:26.425 --> 43:29.341
I'm with a girl right now.

43:31.341 --> 43:32.175
Okay.

43:33.716 --> 43:38.050
That's unusual, and
what do you need me for?

43:39.300 --> 43:40.841
I can't relax.

43:44.050 --> 43:45.133
And why is that?

43:50.675 --> 43:52.591
She, uh, she's quiet.

43:53.800 --> 43:55.423
Mm-hmm.

43:55.425 --> 43:56.675
Okay, so don't worry.

44:00.008 --> 44:02.466
Girls, they can be like that.

44:04.258 --> 44:08.381
Usually they just want
you to take the lead.

44:08.383 --> 44:09.923
Huh?

44:09.925 --> 44:10.758
Relax.

44:17.300 --> 44:19.881
You want me to
warm you up a bit?

44:19.883 --> 44:21.258
Yes, that would be great.

44:23.591 --> 44:24.425
You want

44:26.591 --> 44:27.758
the strawberries?

44:28.800 --> 44:30.716
I really like the
strawberries.

44:43.133 --> 44:45.383
You like that, don't you?

44:54.466 --> 44:55.300
Mm-mm.

45:05.216 --> 45:06.550
Please, go on.

46:38.258 --> 46:39.133
Oh, fuck!

46:40.050 --> 46:40.883
Come on.

46:46.550 --> 46:48.631
Klara, drink, drink, it's okay.

46:48.633 --> 46:50.548
It's water, drink, drink, drink.

46:50.550 --> 46:52.964
It's water, drink, drink.

47:21.675 --> 47:23.300
Spengler?

47:25.258 --> 47:26.091
Spengler?

47:27.758 --> 47:28.591
Hello?

47:29.508 --> 47:31.633
The strawberries are gone.

48:41.258 --> 48:42.091
Klara?

49:00.300 --> 49:01.133
Klara?

49:25.425 --> 49:26.925
Klara, Klara, hey!

49:43.300 --> 49:44.466
Oh fuck, fuck.

49:55.716 --> 49:56.633
Okay, fine.

50:27.258 --> 50:28.925
Delivery,
Mr. Piet!

50:34.591 --> 50:36.173
Come on, I know you're in there.

50:36.175 --> 50:37.633
- I heard you.
- Shit.

50:39.591 --> 50:41.714
Late
night express delivery.

50:41.716 --> 50:43.381
I didn't order anything.

50:43.383 --> 50:44.464
Are you sure?

50:44.466 --> 50:45.964
Yeah, I'm sure.

50:45.966 --> 50:47.673
But this
is your usual delivery;

50:47.675 --> 50:50.589
sushi set A, extra soy sauce.

50:50.591 --> 50:52.798
Yeah, well,
I didn't order anything.

50:52.800 --> 50:54.216
But this is your address.

50:57.508 --> 51:01.716
No, that says 47, this is 41.

51:02.550 --> 51:04.964
Oh, sorry about that.

51:04.966 --> 51:08.048
Why is everyone in this
building so crazy about sushi?

51:08.050 --> 51:10.339
I don't know.

51:10.341 --> 51:13.256
Anyhow,
sorry for the intrusion.

51:13.258 --> 51:14.339
Okay.

51:14.341 --> 51:15.339
And have
yourself a good night.

51:15.341 --> 51:16.175
You, too.

51:27.008 --> 51:30.175
Delivery,
Mr. Osmond!

54:24.758 --> 54:25.591
Okay.

59:33.925 --> 59:35.091
Piet!

59:37.216 --> 59:38.050
Let me in!

01:00:01.675 --> 01:00:04.925
Alex,
what are you doing here?

01:00:09.925 --> 01:00:11.550
I'm gonna kill her, Piet.

01:00:13.175 --> 01:00:14.925
What are you talking about?

01:00:18.133 --> 01:00:19.675
She is with Mark now.

01:00:21.008 --> 01:00:22.256
Sports science Mark.

01:00:22.258 --> 01:00:23.091
Your ex?

01:00:31.008 --> 01:00:32.966
Don't patronize me, smartass.

01:00:34.258 --> 01:00:35.091
Huh?

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:38.923
Calm down, please calm down.

01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:41.341
It's a farce, I told you.

01:00:43.008 --> 01:00:44.966
Where is my ignorance
when I need it?

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.256
For a little while,
just for a little while,

01:00:55.258 --> 01:00:56.800
I thought it was gonna work out.

01:01:01.133 --> 01:01:02.258
I know how you feel.

01:01:04.675 --> 01:01:08.633
And it's gonna be, uh,
it's gonna be okay.

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:11.633
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:19.425
You're beautiful,
man, you know that?

01:01:27.425 --> 01:01:28.589
I gotta piss.

01:01:28.591 --> 01:01:30.258
Go on, go on home.

01:01:32.341 --> 01:01:33.550
I gotta piss.

01:01:42.841 --> 01:01:46.673
I can handle this myself!

01:01:46.675 --> 01:01:49.425
You better get ready
for disco attire.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.050
You...

01:02:02.716 --> 01:02:05.425
Should hold yourself
in higher esteem.

01:05:40.425 --> 01:05:41.675
I'm so sorry.

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:13.425
Third floor,
door opening.

01:06:28.966 --> 01:06:31.175
Second floor, door opening.

01:07:55.591 --> 01:07:56.425
Hello.

01:07:57.841 --> 01:07:58.925
Are you okay?

01:08:01.508 --> 01:08:02.675
What happened?

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:09.464
A bird, a bird.

01:08:09.466 --> 01:08:10.425
A bird?

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:15.214
Yes, I saw a bird and
I fell, it scared me.

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.839
Shall
I call a doctor?

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:17.675
No!

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:20.425
No.

01:08:22.466 --> 01:08:23.300
No.

01:08:31.758 --> 01:08:32.591
Thank you.

01:08:45.423 --> 01:08:46.298
Okay, fine.

01:08:47.341 --> 01:08:48.880
So.

01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:51.423
Thank you, really.

01:08:53.256 --> 01:08:55.630
How can I return the favor?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:56.923
Where are you going?

01:08:59.591 --> 01:09:00.755
North.

01:09:00.756 --> 01:09:03.423
Perfect, you'll drive me home.

01:09:05.048 --> 01:09:06.421
Okay.

01:09:14.298 --> 01:09:15.798
Can you even drive a car?

01:09:23.466 --> 01:09:25.880
Why do you book a
car if you can't drive?

01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:26.965
How will you get back?

01:09:29.216 --> 01:09:30.548
It doesn't matter now.

01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:34.381
You're a little strange,
Thomas.

01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:36.796
Why do you call me Thomas?

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:38.296
It's on
the parcels.

01:09:38.298 --> 01:09:39.341
Isn't that your name?

01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:42.630
Yeah, sure, yeah, of course.

01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:44.171
I can easily remember because

01:09:44.173 --> 01:09:46.006
I have a grandson called Thomas.

01:09:47.966 --> 01:09:49.091
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

01:09:51.673 --> 01:09:54.046
- What are they, anyway?
- Hmm?

01:09:54.048 --> 01:09:54.964
What are they?

01:09:54.966 --> 01:09:56.173
- The packages?
- Yeah.

01:09:57.132 --> 01:09:58.382
Return consignments.

01:09:59.257 --> 01:10:00.423
Are they broken?

01:10:02.173 --> 01:10:03.007
Yeah.

01:10:04.091 --> 01:10:05.421
Yeah, they're broken.

01:10:05.423 --> 01:10:06.757
Oh.

01:10:16.007 --> 01:10:16.965
Border police.

01:10:19.425 --> 01:10:20.466
I have to go out.

01:10:21.841 --> 01:10:22.798
Why?

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.714
I have no papers.

01:10:23.716 --> 01:10:25.755
Like ID,
driver's license, what?

01:10:25.757 --> 01:10:26.589
Visa.

01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:28.173
You don't have a visa?

01:10:28.175 --> 01:10:29.089
No.

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:31.048
How did you get the
job at the school?

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:34.007
I have an agreement
but I can't talk about it.

01:10:35.216 --> 01:10:37.091
Can we go around somehow?

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:47.505
I'm really sorry.

01:10:47.507 --> 01:10:48.340
Wait!

01:10:51.007 --> 01:10:53.005
Wait, wait, please wait,
I need your help!

01:10:53.007 --> 01:10:53.840
I need your help!

01:10:54.716 --> 01:10:56.923
I can leave the car
here but I can't

01:10:56.925 --> 01:10:59.007
make it through the forest
alone, please.

01:11:14.716 --> 01:11:16.589
No, fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:11:16.591 --> 01:11:17.714
Shh!

01:11:17.716 --> 01:11:19.423
Fuck!

01:11:19.425 --> 01:11:20.548
Fuck!

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:22.130
What?

01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.090
- It's just a phone.
- Fuck!

01:11:26.007 --> 01:11:27.632
It's not just a phone!

01:11:28.675 --> 01:11:30.339
I don't know where we are

01:11:30.341 --> 01:11:32.005
and I don't know
where we're going.

01:11:32.007 --> 01:11:32.839
Okay?

01:11:32.841 --> 01:11:35.383
Thomas, what's wrong with you?

01:11:40.175 --> 01:11:43.673
Something horrible
happened tonight.

01:11:43.675 --> 01:11:45.257
I don't
want to know!

01:11:46.341 --> 01:11:48.133
Pull yourself together
and let's go!

01:11:57.632 --> 01:12:00.132
Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:05.132 --> 01:12:07.507
Okay, let's go.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:25.590
Sorry.

01:12:27.132 --> 01:12:28.798
There it is.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:29.800
Thank God.

01:12:35.841 --> 01:12:37.548
I have
to go left now.

01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:38.966
Can you make it on your own?

01:12:40.466 --> 01:12:41.755
Yeah.

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.257
Okay.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.925
Your name is not Thomas, right?

01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:48.675
No, it's not.

01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:53.173
Your name is Nathalie,
though, right?

01:12:53.175 --> 01:12:55.757
I've been in bad
situations, too, Thomas.

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:58.340
It's Piet.

01:12:59.466 --> 01:13:03.048
Oh, goodbye, Piet.

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.882
Thank you.

01:13:10.675 --> 01:13:11.507
Nathalie?

01:13:13.425 --> 01:13:14.925
I can help you with your visa.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.841
Um, I was quite drunk,
to be honest.

01:16:05.966 --> 01:16:08.675
I guess we played some
drinking game, or whatever.

01:16:09.591 --> 01:16:10.839
Yeah, and then I must have

01:16:10.841 --> 01:16:13.048
destroyed his
floor at some point.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:14.380
But he was cool about it.

01:16:14.382 --> 01:16:16.548
He even walked me
back to my room.

01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:18.214
I was late at the campus,

01:16:18.216 --> 01:16:21.341
because of the dance,
and I met Piet.

01:16:22.466 --> 01:16:25.089
And he walked me
o the bus station.

01:16:25.091 --> 01:16:27.341
Just in time to wait
for the last bus.

01:16:28.507 --> 01:16:29.382
The ticket?

01:16:30.716 --> 01:16:33.883
Uh, no, I don't have it anymore.

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:38.632
You know, I'm really
bad with papers.

01:16:39.841 --> 01:16:43.173
Well, he showed up at the
market at around 5:00 a.m.

01:16:43.175 --> 01:16:44.339
It must have been the first time

01:16:44.341 --> 01:16:46.505
I've seen him leave
his dormitory building.

01:16:46.507 --> 01:16:49.839
Usually, he gets everything
delivered to him to his door.

01:16:49.841 --> 01:16:52.423
I woke up in my
bathroom

01:16:52.425 --> 01:16:55.007
and he brought me
painkillers, that's all.

01:16:56.257 --> 01:16:59.090
I don't remember
if he was carrying parcels.

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:02.755
Maybe he was carrying something?

01:17:02.757 --> 01:17:05.089
I don't know, I cannot recall.

01:17:05.091 --> 01:17:07.923
I was at his place
earlier that evening,

01:17:07.925 --> 01:17:09.589
but it was a wrong delivery.

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:12.714
No, I don't think there
was anyone else with him.

01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:15.255
No, I don't think you'll
find anything on his computer.

01:17:15.257 --> 01:17:18.089
He's not the type of
guy and even if he was,

01:17:18.091 --> 01:17:19.673
somebody as qualified as him

01:17:19.675 --> 01:17:21.425
wouldn't leave anything
suspicious.

01:17:22.632 --> 01:17:23.630
I deliver something

01:17:23.632 --> 01:17:25.589
to him almost every day.

01:17:25.591 --> 01:17:26.508
He's always the same.

01:17:27.966 --> 01:17:30.923
He was
friendly and helpful.

01:17:30.925 --> 01:17:32.050
He's a good boy.

01:17:36.425 --> 01:17:37.425
Excuse me.

01:17:40.925 --> 01:17:41.966
Are you Piet Carnell?

01:17:45.632 --> 01:17:49.382
Stop me now if what
I say upsets you.

01:17:50.925 --> 01:17:53.300
But I'm having
trouble believing that.

01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:55.632
What I'm missing here is

01:17:57.507 --> 01:18:02.130
the emotional currency
to your personality.

01:18:02.132 --> 01:18:05.464
Piet, I actually learned more
about you

01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:09.966
from the term paper than I
did from the police reports.

01:18:11.591 --> 01:18:13.505
Please understand me.

01:18:13.507 --> 01:18:16.630
I can only lay this case to rest

01:18:16.632 --> 01:18:19.007
when I'm convinced
my doubts are wrong.

01:18:20.591 --> 01:18:24.508
So, I'm asking you, if you can,

01:18:26.716 --> 01:18:29.341
to assist me with my dilemma.

01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:33.841
I'll see what I can do.

01:18:37.132 --> 01:18:38.340
What do you want to know?

01:18:40.257 --> 01:18:41.757
What did you like about her?

01:18:49.175 --> 01:18:50.257
Klara was...

01:18:54.175 --> 01:18:55.007
She was...

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:59.758
She saw me as a whole person.

01:19:04.050 --> 01:19:09.050
This might sound stupid,
but it felt good.

01:19:11.175 --> 01:19:13.175
It doesn't sound
stupid at all.

01:19:15.632 --> 01:19:18.173
She must have liked you as well.

01:19:18.175 --> 01:19:19.548
We were close.

01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:21.216
Closer than you
told the police?

01:19:24.007 --> 01:19:27.425
I understand,
I'm not judging you.

01:19:29.716 --> 01:19:31.841
Did you two ever sleep together?

01:19:38.382 --> 01:19:39.755
Yes.

01:19:39.757 --> 01:19:42.590
Did you sleep together on
the night she disappeared?

01:19:47.925 --> 01:19:49.007
You did, didn't you?

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.716
It's nobody's business.

01:19:55.966 --> 01:19:56.800
You're right.

01:19:58.382 --> 01:20:00.050
But why keep it a secret?

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:06.425
Klara really never said so,

01:20:09.257 --> 01:20:14.257
but I kind of knew she didn't
want anybody to know about us.

01:20:17.382 --> 01:20:18.675
You were angry at her.

01:20:22.966 --> 01:20:23.800
I guess.

01:20:25.632 --> 01:20:27.050
Did you want to hurt her?

01:20:31.841 --> 01:20:33.089
No.

01:20:38.591 --> 01:20:40.591
I, uh, I never wanted
her to get hurt.

01:20:41.425 --> 01:20:42.257
Mmm.

01:20:44.382 --> 01:20:49.300
We had a fight two days
before she went missing

01:20:50.175 --> 01:20:55.175
because she didn't want to
commit to me.

01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:59.966
But we met again, we
talked and it was okay.

01:21:02.675 --> 01:21:04.425
But we decided to
leave it at that.

01:21:07.841 --> 01:21:11.466
And we, uh, somehow,
well, we, uh...

01:21:15.007 --> 01:21:16.632
Ended up making love.

01:21:24.966 --> 01:21:26.050
That's, uh...

01:21:29.341 --> 01:21:34.341
I'm sorry, I, uh...

01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.632
Anyway,

01:21:42.757 --> 01:21:46.089
I tried to respect what
I thought was her wish

01:21:46.091 --> 01:21:50.216
and I didn't tell
anybody any of this.

01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:56.130
But then when she
reappeared I felt strange

01:21:56.132 --> 01:21:58.132
for not having told
the entire truth.

01:22:02.882 --> 01:22:05.465
What does it matter now,
anyway, hmm?

01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:10.132
Did you just make that up?

01:22:15.382 --> 01:22:18.382
You believe whatever you
want, okay, Miss Stantz?

01:22:22.925 --> 01:22:27.507
But Klara, she was my
first and I loved her.

01:22:29.882 --> 01:22:30.715
Okay?

01:22:32.591 --> 01:22:33.841
And she broke my heart.

01:22:34.675 --> 01:22:39.675
Yeah, but, she changed my life.

01:22:46.257 --> 01:22:47.965
Without her, I wouldn't,

01:22:50.091 --> 01:22:52.716
I wouldn't be who I am now.

01:23:08.925 --> 01:23:10.257
Are you leaving?

01:23:11.257 --> 01:23:13.965
Yes, excuse the interruption.

01:23:23.257 --> 01:23:26.507
None of what I've told
you proves my innocence.

01:23:28.466 --> 01:23:32.300
In your paper, you talk
about a ghost machine.

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:34.883
Do you know why I like it?

01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:38.382
No.

01:23:40.632 --> 01:23:44.965
'Cause it shows you are an
idealist.

01:23:51.591 --> 01:23:53.339
This is my card.

01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:56.673
Give me a call whenever you
need someone to talk to.

01:23:56.675 --> 01:23:57.591
It's Ketura.

01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:00.175
Thank you.

01:24:03.382 --> 01:24:05.675
It's good talking.

01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:13.130
And I never get girl's
numbers like this.

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:16.132
Don't get
cocky about it.

01:24:37.093 --> 01:24:42.093
