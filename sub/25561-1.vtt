00:33.229 --> 00:34.725
Ungrateful mutt.

00:34.727 --> 00:36.144
I fed you yesterday.

00:36.146 --> 00:38.005
What are we gonna do
with this thing anyway?

00:38.007 --> 00:39.865
I told you, we're gonna sell him.

00:39.867 --> 00:40.864
To who?

00:40.866 --> 00:41.867
I don't know.

00:41.869 --> 00:43.968
It was your master plan to get him anyway.

00:43.970 --> 00:45.664
I'm sick of him.

00:45.666 --> 00:49.125
Why don't you return
him and get the reward money?

00:49.127 --> 00:50.464
Who's there?

00:50.466 --> 00:52.715
Banjo Cunningham, you ding bat.

00:52.717 --> 00:54.427
Don't you know the voice
of the neighbor you've had

00:54.429 --> 00:55.762
for seven years?

00:56.653 --> 00:58.006
Jimmy, that you?

00:58.008 --> 00:59.611
Well, who else would it be?

00:59.613 --> 01:01.847
Your voice sounds different.

01:01.849 --> 01:03.968
Well, Banjo, when a
boy reaches a certain age,

01:03.970 --> 01:07.451
testosterone kicks in and
his voice starts to change.

01:07.453 --> 01:09.261
You follow me?

01:09.263 --> 01:10.827
Well, if that's so,
ain't your voice supposed

01:10.829 --> 01:12.207
to be deeper?

01:12.209 --> 01:13.584
Barret, do I
need to come out there

01:13.586 --> 01:15.653
and give you a personal
education in health

01:15.655 --> 01:16.988
or lack thereof?

01:18.407 --> 01:19.424
No, Jimmy.

01:19.426 --> 01:20.928
That's what I thought.

01:20.930 --> 01:22.144
What you doing out here?

01:22.146 --> 01:23.904
I'm squatting next to a tree,

01:23.906 --> 01:26.323
what do you think I am doing?

01:27.570 --> 01:29.148
As I was saying,

01:29.150 --> 01:31.147
there's a reward for that missing dog.

01:31.149 --> 01:34.565
I saw a poster on an oak tree
about 100 feet west of here.

01:34.567 --> 01:35.925
If you call the number on the poster,

01:35.927 --> 01:37.645
you can get $50.

01:37.647 --> 01:38.722
You sure?

01:38.724 --> 01:41.584
As sure as I'm sitting here.

01:41.586 --> 01:43.180
Thanks for the tip, Jimmy.

01:43.182 --> 01:45.015
We'll leave you to it.

01:52.429 --> 01:55.012
Sometimes it's just too easy.

01:57.016 --> 01:58.877
I know you may be afraid
of the dark, little buddy,

01:59.010 --> 02:01.026
but it's for your own protection.

02:07.968 --> 02:08.800
That's Kid West.

02:30.132 --> 02:32.387
Hey, your mama told
me to come and find you.

02:32.395 --> 02:33.660
Where have you been?

02:33.677 --> 02:36.269
Sorry, Mrs. Roberts,
can't talk right now.

03:21.652 --> 03:24.111
Now you listen up, Banjo Cunningham,

03:24.211 --> 03:26.129
that's the last time
I wanna hear about you

03:26.131 --> 03:28.085
stealing in my neighborhood.

03:28.087 --> 03:29.149
Oh, by the way,

03:29.216 --> 03:30.830
watch out for gators.

03:30.871 --> 03:32.540
There's no gators in this river.

03:32.598 --> 03:33.599
Oh yeah?

03:33.601 --> 03:34.601
What's that?

03:39.033 --> 03:40.200
Made you look.

03:43.341 --> 03:45.015
We were worried sick.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.551
I didn't think her little
heart was ever gonna mend

03:46.553 --> 03:48.603
if we couldn't get him back.

03:50.035 --> 03:51.868
Thank you, Kid West.

03:58.479 --> 04:00.570
Just doing my duty, ma'am.

04:04.381 --> 04:06.440
We'll miss you around here.

04:23.671 --> 04:25.212
Where have you been?

04:25.229 --> 04:26.888
Sorry I'm late.

04:26.921 --> 04:30.296
What is that silly thing
still doing on your head?

04:35.126 --> 04:37.052
Where do you wanna start?

04:37.177 --> 04:38.595
Just some extra income.

04:38.637 --> 04:40.412
Every little bit helps.

04:42.104 --> 04:43.335
Where did you get it?

04:43.477 --> 04:45.712
From the Edwards family.

04:45.904 --> 04:47.154
Take it back.

04:48.695 --> 04:49.528
Go on now.

04:55.001 --> 04:57.010
Aren't you forgetting something?

05:05.930 --> 05:07.875
Spitting image, I'd say.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.083
Hardly.

05:10.228 --> 05:12.328
I wasn't talking about you.

05:18.984 --> 05:21.801
Try to blend in to your new
neighborhood, young lady.

05:21.803 --> 05:23.899
There are no cowgirls in Minnesota.

05:23.901 --> 05:25.403
Not yet.

05:25.405 --> 05:26.988
I'll be in touch.

05:46.393 --> 05:47.643
Any progress?

05:50.292 --> 05:51.676
Not yet.

05:51.678 --> 05:53.271
But if my calculations are correct,

05:53.273 --> 05:56.172
we're right on top of where it used to be.

05:57.422 --> 05:58.255
Okay.

06:00.052 --> 06:02.012
Something wrong?

06:02.014 --> 06:05.432
Well, it's just that
no one's ever tried to

06:05.790 --> 06:06.623
dig this up before.

06:45.871 --> 06:47.429
You know,

06:47.437 --> 06:51.437
there was a time stations
actually played music.

07:03.644 --> 07:06.682
♪ Through the rain

07:06.684 --> 07:10.199
♪ Through the storm

07:10.201 --> 07:14.368
♪ Through defeat or battering scorn

07:22.407 --> 07:25.374
You better get some
sleep, sweetheart, okay?

07:39.510 --> 07:40.813
I know there's been
a lot of rumors about

07:40.815 --> 07:42.674
what this find actually means.

07:42.676 --> 07:44.514
But can you give us the
historical significance

07:44.516 --> 07:46.471
of what was found?

07:46.473 --> 07:48.615
Well, first of all, it's
important to differentiate

07:48.617 --> 07:50.994
between folklore and fact.

07:50.996 --> 07:53.293
A lot of people misconstrue
this as some sort of

07:53.295 --> 07:56.193
ghost story that's returned to haunt them.

07:56.195 --> 07:57.293
But as a matter of history,

07:57.295 --> 08:00.637
it's quite remarkable that
Walter Smith's personal life...

08:05.445 --> 08:06.370
Hey.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.117
This it?

08:10.225 --> 08:11.216
Uh huh.

08:12.966 --> 08:14.919
Small population.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.819
They're probably all eating breakfast.

08:25.413 --> 08:26.246
Well.

08:27.286 --> 08:28.786
What do you think?

08:40.429 --> 08:43.806
Well, it has character, I'll give it that.

08:43.808 --> 08:45.471
That's one way to put it.

08:45.580 --> 08:48.815
Listen, my hours are gonna
be pretty full at the hospital

08:48.931 --> 08:51.309
so that means you're gonna
have to take care of yourself

08:51.311 --> 08:52.391
most of the time.

08:52.393 --> 08:54.193
Oh, I can handle it.

08:54.195 --> 08:57.521
What I'm saying is, don't
you go looking for trouble.

08:57.523 --> 08:59.143
What if it comes looking for me?

08:59.168 --> 09:00.233
Then hide.

09:06.745 --> 09:08.116
Morning.

09:08.118 --> 09:09.958
That your truck out there?

09:10.117 --> 09:10.950
Uh huh.

09:12.174 --> 09:13.352
Well I just a received report

09:13.354 --> 09:15.877
that it's a stolen vehicle.

09:16.435 --> 09:17.969
I beg your pardon?

09:19.278 --> 09:20.732
Just kidding you.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.833
I'm Sheriff Badger, just
wanted to welcome you

09:22.835 --> 09:24.476
to the neighborhood.

09:24.478 --> 09:25.772
Well, thank you.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.639
I'm Faye Cooper, and this is Harper.

09:27.641 --> 09:28.810
Hello, little lady.

09:28.812 --> 09:30.457
My daddy was a sheriff.

09:30.459 --> 09:31.792
Is that right?

09:33.257 --> 09:35.390
He died in the line of duty.

09:35.392 --> 09:36.225
Harper.

09:37.757 --> 09:39.504
I'm very sorry to hear that.

09:39.506 --> 09:40.685
That's okay.

09:40.835 --> 09:41.953
He was a hero.

09:41.955 --> 09:43.461
They called him Sheriff West.

09:43.463 --> 09:44.296
He also...

09:44.421 --> 09:45.938
Well, thank you for stopping by.

09:45.940 --> 09:47.780
We sure do appreciate it.

09:47.955 --> 09:48.955
Of course.

09:48.957 --> 09:51.393
I'll leave you to settle in.

09:51.395 --> 09:54.704
But if you two need anything
at all, you let me know.

09:57.934 --> 10:00.150
Welcome to the neighborhood.

10:03.509 --> 10:04.342
You shouldn't say things
like that to strangers.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.357
Nice hat.

11:27.277 --> 11:28.559
Nice bike.

11:28.561 --> 11:29.751
You new around here?

11:29.968 --> 11:32.085
My mom and I just got in yesterday.

11:32.118 --> 11:33.732
Name's Kid West.

11:33.782 --> 11:35.450
Your first name is Kid?

11:35.452 --> 11:37.338
What happens when you grow up?

11:37.421 --> 11:39.977
Haven't you ever heard of a nickname?

11:40.036 --> 11:42.596
Not really a nickname person.

11:43.513 --> 11:45.635
People just call me Angie.

11:45.637 --> 11:48.771
You're gonna need a faster
bike in this neighborhood.

11:48.773 --> 11:50.878
My bike is plenty fast.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.320
You wanna race?

11:52.354 --> 11:53.349
Sure.

11:53.351 --> 11:54.184
You wanna lose?

11:58.634 --> 12:01.775
Talk is cheap, Miss
I don't like nicknames.

12:01.777 --> 12:03.292
Count of three.

12:03.433 --> 12:04.266
One.

12:05.248 --> 12:06.430
Two.

12:07.013 --> 12:07.846
Three.

12:12.321 --> 12:14.819
Hey wait, where's the finish line?

12:38.974 --> 12:39.807
Hey you!

12:41.697 --> 12:43.772
Who gave you permission
to ride on my streets?

12:43.774 --> 12:45.449
Don't you know the rules?

12:52.614 --> 12:54.976
Let me guess, you're the rule makers?

12:55.318 --> 12:56.470
Right.

12:56.472 --> 12:58.218
First rule, is that only kids in our gang

12:58.220 --> 13:00.244
can ride on this street.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.044
Unless they get permission from you?

13:02.046 --> 13:03.912
You're catching on.

13:03.914 --> 13:06.693
I'm guessing that
permission costs something.

13:06.935 --> 13:09.137
You're smarter than you look, Cowgirl.

13:09.139 --> 13:10.998
Time to pay your daily fee.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.181
You're gonna charge that
other girl the same thing?

13:13.398 --> 13:14.534
You mean Pocahontas?

13:14.536 --> 13:17.028
She's my girlfriend, she gets a free pass.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.572
How romantic.

13:18.780 --> 13:20.833
She part of your gang too?

13:21.433 --> 13:22.782
Not yet.

13:22.784 --> 13:24.344
But she'll come around.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.771
What happens if someone
doesn't pay their daily fee?

13:29.161 --> 13:30.947
They get taught a lesson.

13:32.123 --> 13:34.157
Don't you move, cow pie.

13:39.024 --> 13:40.664
Hold on there, Axel.

13:41.422 --> 13:42.933
Not bad for a girl.

13:43.324 --> 13:45.099
Make you a deal.

13:45.101 --> 13:46.920
Do us enough favors, you
can ride these streets

13:46.922 --> 13:48.564
all you want.

13:48.566 --> 13:51.150
I'm sure you don't give
many offers like that.

13:51.152 --> 13:53.837
Like I said, you're
smarter than you look.

13:54.337 --> 13:55.624
I'll pass.

13:56.174 --> 13:57.341
Big mistake.

14:00.238 --> 14:01.795
Better watch out, Cowgirl.

14:01.953 --> 14:03.620
You and your family.

14:18.912 --> 14:19.745
Thanks.

14:21.497 --> 14:23.330
Friendly neighborhood?

14:24.778 --> 14:26.277
Colorful.

14:26.302 --> 14:28.175
So how was your first day?

14:28.213 --> 14:29.839
Oh, it was okay.

14:30.106 --> 14:33.626
A few nurses in another unit were let go.

14:34.150 --> 14:35.733
They were fired?

14:36.033 --> 14:38.616
No, it was just a low census.

14:39.366 --> 14:40.966
When the hospital doesn't
have enough patients

14:41.008 --> 14:42.592
in a particular unit,

14:42.775 --> 14:45.792
the hospital has to let
people go sometimes.

14:46.234 --> 14:50.009
Would this ever happen
to someone in your unit?

14:51.415 --> 14:52.415
Well, the thing is.

14:58.780 --> 14:59.613
Hello?

15:00.432 --> 15:01.990
Oh, hi.

15:02.215 --> 15:03.256
Yeah.

15:03.258 --> 15:04.091
I wish.

15:04.950 --> 15:06.474
Well, it's not very good.

15:06.607 --> 15:07.805
Now we go live to Tracy Storm

15:07.807 --> 15:09.121
who is outside the museum.

15:09.123 --> 15:11.254
Tracy, what can you tell us?

15:11.454 --> 15:13.130
Well, Erica, the key that was discovered

15:13.272 --> 15:16.114
just a few days ago was
stolen here last night.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.095
The key is believed to have once belonged

15:18.097 --> 15:19.637
to Walter Smith.

15:19.639 --> 15:23.578
The legendary tycoon who
died in a house fire in 1855.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.455
The archeologist who led the excavation

15:25.457 --> 15:28.957
is offering a $5000 reward for its return.

15:31.957 --> 15:33.624
No, it's not good.

15:34.636 --> 15:35.469
I don't think it'll last
more than a couple of weeks.

15:59.127 --> 16:01.544
You're right, she needs it.

16:42.487 --> 16:43.904
Can I help you?

16:45.628 --> 16:49.320
I appreciate that, but
I think I can manage.

16:50.231 --> 16:53.066
I'm quite certain your
people were already here.

16:53.068 --> 16:54.527
Are you sure another
crime scene investigation

16:54.529 --> 16:56.196
is really necessary?

16:57.068 --> 16:58.927
I'm not exactly with the police, sir.

16:58.929 --> 16:59.989
You don't say.

16:59.991 --> 17:01.199
Based on my initial findings,

17:01.201 --> 17:02.927
I'd say whoever committed this crime

17:02.929 --> 17:05.164
wasn't much taller than I am.

17:05.165 --> 17:06.797
And how would you know that?

17:06.799 --> 17:08.992
I know things about short people.

17:09.308 --> 17:10.865
I see.

17:10.867 --> 17:12.730
What do you know about the stolen key?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.662
Just what I've heard on the news.

17:14.664 --> 17:16.946
Why would somebody want this key so badly?

17:16.949 --> 17:18.807
Well, depends on what it unlocks.

17:18.809 --> 17:20.127
Any ideas?

17:20.130 --> 17:22.565
My theory is it has something
to do with Walter Smith's

17:22.647 --> 17:24.185
hidden collectibles.

17:24.188 --> 17:26.970
We were digging around where
his mansion used to be.

17:26.972 --> 17:29.809
And some people believe we
should have left it all alone.

17:29.811 --> 17:31.273
Why's that?

17:31.431 --> 17:33.764
According to urban legend,

17:35.329 --> 17:36.646
he was cursed.

17:46.259 --> 17:48.014
Well, this is a nice surprise,

17:48.016 --> 17:49.553
what brings you out here?

17:49.555 --> 17:51.217
I'm investigating the burglary.

17:51.219 --> 17:53.284
May I ask you a couple of questions?

17:53.286 --> 17:55.404
That's usually my line.

17:55.406 --> 17:57.404
But it sounds better coming from you.

17:57.406 --> 17:59.244
What do you know about Walter Smith?

17:59.246 --> 18:01.265
Oh, a fair amount, I'd say.

18:01.267 --> 18:02.284
He was a great man.

18:02.286 --> 18:04.844
He did a lot for his
community in the mid 1800s

18:04.846 --> 18:07.105
including his Ojibwe neighbors,

18:07.107 --> 18:10.221
which wasn't a very
popular stance back then.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.305
But he did a lot of trading with them.

18:12.307 --> 18:14.158
Valuable sort of stuff.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.425
And all the valuables he traded

18:15.427 --> 18:17.143
were lost in the fire, correct?

18:17.145 --> 18:18.387
That's right.

18:18.570 --> 18:19.628
Unless.

18:21.322 --> 18:22.663
Unless he had a separate place

18:22.665 --> 18:24.807
where he kept his collectibles.

18:24.809 --> 18:26.864
I see you've done your homework.

18:26.866 --> 18:27.983
And if there were such a place,

18:27.985 --> 18:31.203
those collectibles would
be worth quite a bit.

18:31.205 --> 18:32.755
Any suspects?

18:32.757 --> 18:35.127
As much as I appreciate your enthusiasm,

18:35.129 --> 18:38.087
I can't talk about an
ongoing investigation.

18:38.089 --> 18:39.089
Sure you can.

18:39.091 --> 18:41.384
From one officer of the law to another.

18:41.386 --> 18:42.941
Excuse me?

18:42.943 --> 18:45.793
My daddy made me an honorary deputy.

18:47.469 --> 18:50.336
Off the record then, I'm not the press.

18:56.209 --> 18:57.905
Well, the short answer is, no.

18:57.907 --> 19:00.247
But I have a theory.

19:00.249 --> 19:02.647
My guess is that anyone going
after those collectibles

19:02.649 --> 19:05.843
thinks they have some
sort of claim on 'em.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.684
Like a descendant or something?

19:07.686 --> 19:08.685
That's a good thought.

19:08.687 --> 19:12.385
But no one knows what happened
to old Walter's offspring.

19:12.387 --> 19:15.889
Then who else would think
they have some sort of claim?

19:15.891 --> 19:18.369
The culture that traded with him?

19:18.371 --> 19:21.185
You think whoever
stole the key was Ojibwe?

19:21.187 --> 19:23.287
That wouldn't be very popular
with the Ojibwe community

19:23.289 --> 19:26.189
in town, but that's my theory.

19:27.564 --> 19:30.573
Seems like the only working one we have.

19:33.001 --> 19:35.188
You seem pretty anxious about something.

19:35.190 --> 19:38.123
Thanks for the help, Sheriff, gotta run.

20:20.940 --> 20:22.690
What are you doing?

20:24.684 --> 20:27.776
Kid West on official
duty, you're in big trouble.

20:27.778 --> 20:30.459
I think you're the one
going to be in big trouble.

20:30.461 --> 20:31.599
Oh yeah?

20:31.601 --> 20:35.684
When my uncle sees you
messing with his plants.

20:36.983 --> 20:38.938
You match the description of the thief.

20:38.940 --> 20:40.415
This would go a lot easier for you

20:40.417 --> 20:41.914
if you confessed right now.

20:41.916 --> 20:42.917
Oh really?

20:42.919 --> 20:43.994
Yeah.

20:43.996 --> 20:45.354
You want me to make a confession?

20:45.356 --> 20:46.490
That's right.

20:46.492 --> 20:47.535
Okay.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.295
I confess that you're a terrible detective

20:49.297 --> 20:50.964
and your bike sucks.

20:52.257 --> 20:54.752
The guilty always try
to change the subject.

20:54.754 --> 20:55.921
Are we done?

20:57.316 --> 20:58.149
For now.

21:12.903 --> 21:14.079
What's wrong?

21:14.081 --> 21:16.101
I'm late for work.

21:16.103 --> 21:17.338
You've been late before,
I've never seen you

21:17.340 --> 21:19.461
this upset about it.

21:19.463 --> 21:20.546
Is that so?

21:25.048 --> 21:28.411
Did you take your father's
wedding ring out of my dresser?

21:28.413 --> 21:29.246
No, why?

21:30.739 --> 21:32.839
I can't find it.

21:33.031 --> 21:34.032
I have a long shift today,

21:34.034 --> 21:35.509
so I won't be home for dinner.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.486
There's leftover lamb chops in the fridge.

21:47.111 --> 21:48.694
Just do me a favor.

21:55.531 --> 21:58.781
Just stay around the house today, okay?

22:43.602 --> 22:45.122
I like your subtle approach.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.657
Sometimes it's not about
force, boys, it's about fear.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.278
We gave him a good
scare though, didn't we?

22:50.280 --> 22:51.715
Just wait till school starts.

22:51.717 --> 22:53.776
Then we'll really give it to 'em.

23:00.872 --> 23:03.100
How much do you think
we'll get for that?

23:03.102 --> 23:04.652
I don't know, not much.

23:04.654 --> 23:05.821
Piece of junk.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.627
Easy there, Mucus.

23:26.334 --> 23:28.315
What do we do next?

23:28.317 --> 23:31.395
Wait for further instruction.

23:31.397 --> 23:32.497
Is it true what the old man said

23:32.499 --> 23:35.419
that the treasure or whatever it is,

23:35.421 --> 23:37.338
has some sort of power?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.248
Come on.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.083
I wanna beat you guys again in Zombies.

23:59.451 --> 24:01.115
You win!

24:01.117 --> 24:02.115
Yeah!

24:02.117 --> 24:03.155
One more game.

24:03.157 --> 24:04.873
We've been playing for four hours.

24:04.875 --> 24:05.971
Don't be a wuss.

24:05.973 --> 24:07.833
Why don't you be the zombie this time?

24:07.835 --> 24:10.687
I told you, that's
not the avatar I prefer.

24:10.689 --> 24:12.681
I'm down for another game.

24:12.683 --> 24:13.766
Fine.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.323
Zombie Pandemonium Three!

24:18.656 --> 24:19.823
Yeah!

25:16.373 --> 25:18.517
Did you guys hear that?

25:18.784 --> 25:19.838
Aww, come on.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.433
Hey, what is going on?

25:21.435 --> 25:22.430
Let me guess, your stupid dad

25:22.432 --> 25:24.778
didn't pay the electrical bill again.

25:24.780 --> 25:25.854
Shut up.

25:25.856 --> 25:27.358
There's other stuff we can do.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.915
Like what?

25:28.917 --> 25:31.454
Let's go blow up a
watermelon with firecrackers.

25:31.456 --> 25:33.278
Now that is a good idea.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.530
There's some fireworks in the bathroom.

25:48.954 --> 25:50.216
Come on, Braden.

25:50.218 --> 25:52.051
I'm coming.

26:00.534 --> 26:01.790
What are you doing here?

26:01.792 --> 26:02.932
What am I doing here?

26:02.934 --> 26:04.073
What are you doing here?

26:04.075 --> 26:05.070
Give me the key.

26:05.072 --> 26:06.655
Not on your life.

26:11.190 --> 26:13.023
Let's do that again.

26:14.408 --> 26:16.991
Hey, what's wrong with Mucus?

26:26.073 --> 26:26.906
Come on.

26:28.093 --> 26:29.176
It's stuck.

26:33.041 --> 26:34.041
Follow me.

26:55.476 --> 26:56.552
No.

26:56.554 --> 26:58.376
Come on, into the tunnel.

26:58.378 --> 27:00.729
I'm not going in there.

27:00.731 --> 27:01.912
Let's go.

27:01.914 --> 27:04.194
I told you, I'm not going in there.

27:04.196 --> 27:06.388
Don't tell me you're scared.

27:13.647 --> 27:15.230
Nice try, ladies.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.845
Now give me the key.

27:23.396 --> 27:24.313
Go fetch.

27:26.538 --> 27:28.456
You're a real piece of work, Pocahontas.

27:28.458 --> 27:30.313
Even after all I've done for you.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.065
That's not my name.

27:37.484 --> 27:39.045
Braden, if you try to wrangle us,

27:39.047 --> 27:41.354
you have another thing coming.

27:41.356 --> 27:45.189
Big talk coming from
a cowgirl with no rope.

27:59.042 --> 28:00.223
This would have never happened

28:00.225 --> 28:02.086
if you didn't get us caught.

28:02.088 --> 28:03.100
Me?

28:03.102 --> 28:04.644
It was my idea to get the key.

28:04.646 --> 28:06.533
Should have never tipped you off.

28:06.535 --> 28:08.096
The only thing that got us caught

28:08.098 --> 28:10.955
was that ancient bike of yours.

28:10.957 --> 28:13.613
If I had a dollar for every
time you mentioned my bike,

28:13.615 --> 28:15.095
I wouldn't even need the reward money.

28:15.097 --> 28:17.437
Let's just try to get free.

28:17.439 --> 28:20.189
As usual, I'm way ahead of you.

28:34.178 --> 28:36.592
There's more important
things than money, you know.

28:36.594 --> 28:39.472
It's not like that, I'm
providing for my family.

28:39.474 --> 28:42.554
Isn't that supposed
to be your mom's job?

28:42.556 --> 28:43.556
Forget it.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.556
Aren't you gonna go get your bike?

28:48.978 --> 28:50.395
Forget my bike.

28:51.276 --> 28:52.277
You're right.

28:52.279 --> 28:54.871
It's too slow for this stupid town.

29:13.673 --> 29:15.090
Where were you?

29:17.508 --> 29:19.645
I was out for a walk.

29:19.647 --> 29:21.768
At one o'clock in the morning?

29:21.770 --> 29:24.349
What were you doing out there?

29:24.351 --> 29:25.405
Sorry.

29:25.407 --> 29:27.688
Stop apologizing

29:27.690 --> 29:29.857
and start listening to me.

29:30.831 --> 29:32.168
If you knew what I was doing and why,

29:32.170 --> 29:34.170
you wouldn't get so mad.

29:36.271 --> 29:37.266
You know what?

29:37.268 --> 29:39.043
I don't care what you
were doing out there.

29:39.045 --> 29:41.085
I have to go to work in a few hours.

29:41.087 --> 29:42.587
Stay up all night.

29:43.484 --> 29:45.629
Blast some music, have a
whole damn rodeo in here

29:45.631 --> 29:46.968
if you want to.

29:46.970 --> 29:49.346
Just stay inside the house.

29:49.348 --> 29:51.265
I can't promise that.

29:52.148 --> 29:53.186
I'm right in the middle of something

29:53.188 --> 29:55.802
that's really important.

29:55.804 --> 29:57.363
Can't take this anymore.

29:57.365 --> 29:59.704
Why can't you understand
what I'm supposed to do?

29:59.706 --> 30:02.088
For God's sake, would you
give this deputy stuff a rest?

30:02.090 --> 30:03.406
Daddy never gave it a rest.

30:03.408 --> 30:05.491
You're not your father!

30:41.620 --> 30:42.870
Anybody home?

31:07.319 --> 31:09.157
Well, hey there.

31:09.159 --> 31:10.492
Your mom around?

31:13.116 --> 31:13.949
Nope.

31:15.319 --> 31:17.236
Must be at work then.

31:18.620 --> 31:20.287
Story of her life.

31:21.955 --> 31:25.217
I'm surprised you're
not out solving a mystery.

31:25.592 --> 31:26.842
I'm grounded.

31:29.500 --> 31:30.333
I see.

31:32.457 --> 31:35.423
You seem more fragrant today, Sheriff.

31:36.642 --> 31:38.378
Beg your pardon?

31:38.380 --> 31:39.380
You stink.

31:43.141 --> 31:44.141
Oh, right.

31:45.580 --> 31:49.237
Well, some habits are hard to break.

31:49.239 --> 31:52.156
Haven't you ever tried the patch?

31:54.322 --> 31:55.489
Didn't take.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.956
You wanna tell me all about it?

32:07.556 --> 32:09.018
I found the key.

32:09.020 --> 32:09.853
What?

32:11.100 --> 32:12.581
I found it.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.741
Then I lost it again.

32:14.743 --> 32:17.237
It's that Braden kid and his friends.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.938
If you can call 'em that.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.211
Oh, yeah, I know about them.

32:21.213 --> 32:23.296
They're trouble makers for sure,

32:23.298 --> 32:26.698
but I don't see 'em as criminals.

32:26.700 --> 32:28.617
You don't believe me?

32:29.699 --> 32:31.178
Well.

32:31.180 --> 32:32.434
Braden doesn't have much of a father.

32:32.436 --> 32:34.538
I suppose it's possible
for a kid to do anything

32:34.540 --> 32:37.861
if he doesn't have the right role model.

32:37.863 --> 32:39.082
I'll tell you what.

32:39.084 --> 32:40.960
I'll look into it.

32:40.962 --> 32:44.384
If they stole that key, I'll
get you the reward money.

32:44.386 --> 32:45.803
How's that sound?

32:46.663 --> 32:48.880
Why would you do that?

32:48.882 --> 32:52.274
Well, I'd do anything
for an honorary deputy.

33:05.854 --> 33:07.271
What do we say?

33:08.073 --> 33:09.490
I'll handle it.

33:31.556 --> 33:33.610
I don't know.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.256
I thought this was
something I could deal with,

33:35.258 --> 33:38.114
but maybe that's just not realistic.

33:39.898 --> 33:42.013
Can you get that?

33:42.015 --> 33:43.676
Well, it's not like I have
a couple thousand dollars

33:43.678 --> 33:44.761
lying around.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.475
The door, please.

33:52.079 --> 33:53.074
Good evening.

33:53.076 --> 33:53.907
Did you find it?

33:53.909 --> 33:55.858
Well, that's what I came to tell you.

33:55.860 --> 33:57.360
Mama, come here.

33:58.959 --> 34:00.709
I'll call you back.

34:04.020 --> 34:05.138
The Sheriff found the missing key

34:05.140 --> 34:06.634
that was on the news.

34:06.636 --> 34:07.816
What are you talking about?

34:07.818 --> 34:08.781
Can I see it?

34:08.783 --> 34:11.239
You didn't let me finish.

34:11.242 --> 34:13.742
I'm afraid they don't have it.

34:15.081 --> 34:17.341
I don't understand.

34:17.342 --> 34:19.899
Well, everybody makes mistakes.

34:19.900 --> 34:23.373
There was no key at that
house or anywhere around it.

34:23.376 --> 34:25.076
And besides, I don't think
those kids are clever enough

34:25.078 --> 34:27.885
to pull off a caper like that.

34:27.887 --> 34:29.283
Thanks for stopping by.

34:29.284 --> 34:31.585
Sorry for wasting your time.

34:31.588 --> 34:33.088
It's no trouble.

34:35.085 --> 34:39.245
I'll let you know of any
further developments.

34:39.246 --> 34:41.414
Off the record, of course.

34:45.295 --> 34:47.745
Can that be the end of this?

35:24.808 --> 35:25.975
And stay in!

35:32.978 --> 35:33.973
Well now,

35:33.975 --> 35:35.296
seems like having friends in high places

35:35.298 --> 35:37.195
isn't everything you thought it would be.

35:37.197 --> 35:38.336
You may have fooled the Sheriff,

35:38.338 --> 35:39.954
but you can't fool me.

35:39.956 --> 35:41.456
I don't have to.

35:43.038 --> 35:44.480
Think I'm tough now?

35:44.482 --> 35:46.843
Just wait till you see what this unlocks.

35:46.845 --> 35:48.178
Enjoy your book.

36:01.703 --> 36:03.370
What do you think?

36:04.567 --> 36:05.562
If you're here to brag,

36:05.564 --> 36:07.183
I'm not in the mood.

36:07.185 --> 36:09.377
You didn't answer my question.

36:09.379 --> 36:10.485
It's amazing, okay?

36:10.487 --> 36:12.442
Now would you please just leave me alone?

36:12.444 --> 36:13.461
Suit yourself.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.735
I just came by to drop it off anyway.

36:16.610 --> 36:17.443
What?

36:17.964 --> 36:20.214
Say hello to your new bike.

36:21.362 --> 36:22.195
Really?

36:23.187 --> 36:25.162
I felt bad about the other night.

36:25.164 --> 36:28.202
Even though technically
it wasn't my fault.

36:28.204 --> 36:31.204
I thought this might make up for it.

36:32.305 --> 36:33.866
See you around.

36:33.868 --> 36:35.201
Wait a second.

36:36.284 --> 36:38.502
What are you up to tonight?

36:38.504 --> 36:39.337
Why?

36:40.630 --> 36:43.089
Plan for an all night meeting.

36:47.416 --> 36:49.418
Doesn't this ruin your
braces or something?

36:49.420 --> 36:50.796
It could.

36:50.798 --> 36:53.462
But I only chew with my lower teeth.

36:53.464 --> 36:55.099
Smart.

36:55.101 --> 36:57.142
So why don't you like nicknames?

36:57.144 --> 36:58.139
We don't need 'em.

36:58.141 --> 37:01.078
We should be proud of
the names we're given.

37:01.080 --> 37:02.950
I guess that makes sense.

37:02.952 --> 37:05.318
Aren't you proud of your name?

37:05.320 --> 37:07.157
It means one who plays the harp.

37:07.159 --> 37:08.242
Would you be?

37:09.176 --> 37:11.697
Still, your father gave it to you.

37:11.699 --> 37:12.532
My mom.

37:14.099 --> 37:15.099
Tell you what,

37:15.101 --> 37:16.939
you can call me Little Sky.

37:16.941 --> 37:18.461
I thought you hated nicknames.

37:18.463 --> 37:20.092
I do.

37:20.094 --> 37:22.315
Then why are you letting
me call you Little Sky?

37:22.317 --> 37:24.276
Cause it's my last name.

37:26.877 --> 37:29.419
You gonna be sticking around here?

37:29.421 --> 37:30.898
I hope so.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.172
What does that mean?

37:32.174 --> 37:33.377
My mom has a new job.

37:33.379 --> 37:34.994
But...

37:35.028 --> 37:37.039
I don't think it's gonna last.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.539
Well in the meantime,

37:38.541 --> 37:40.958
I need to show you something.

37:42.980 --> 37:44.155
I'm sure by now you've probably heard

37:44.157 --> 37:45.314
about Walter Smith.

37:45.316 --> 37:47.979
Yeah, that old community do gooder.

37:47.981 --> 37:49.899
Where did you hear that?

37:49.901 --> 37:51.179
A friend.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.697
Your friend needs a history lesson.

37:53.699 --> 37:56.097
Walter Smith traded a lot with the Ojibwe.

37:56.099 --> 37:58.358
But one day, he falsely
accused three Ojibwe men

37:58.360 --> 38:00.420
of stealing from him.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.920
What happened to them?

38:10.419 --> 38:11.798
This is my ancestor.

38:11.800 --> 38:14.497
He was a powerful Ojibwe medicine man.

38:14.499 --> 38:16.013
What does that mean?

38:16.015 --> 38:17.435
He had certain gifts that connected him

38:17.437 --> 38:19.547
to the spiritual world.

38:19.549 --> 38:22.049
It sort of runs in the family.

38:23.043 --> 38:26.134
Anyway, he knew that
Smith was a collector.

38:26.136 --> 38:28.977
So he made this staff as a peace offering.

38:28.979 --> 38:30.721
Being the greedy man that he was,

38:30.723 --> 38:33.217
Smith foolishly accepted the gift.

38:33.219 --> 38:35.119
What do you mean?

38:35.121 --> 38:38.113
My ancestor put a
terrible curse on the staff.

38:38.115 --> 38:39.718
The day Smith accepted it,

38:39.720 --> 38:43.259
his mansion burned down
and he died in the fire.

38:43.261 --> 38:45.014
What happened to the staff?

38:45.016 --> 38:46.034
Well, before he died,

38:46.036 --> 38:48.038
Smith put it in his hidden cavern.

38:48.040 --> 38:49.281
My ancestor found its location

38:49.283 --> 38:51.382
and my family has been
trying to keep it hidden

38:51.384 --> 38:53.222
for all these years.

38:53.224 --> 38:55.579
The staff has to be destroyed.

38:55.581 --> 38:56.822
If anyone finds it,

38:56.824 --> 38:58.907
the curse will come back.

39:00.941 --> 39:03.024
You think curses exist?

39:04.963 --> 39:06.380
I know they do.

39:10.970 --> 39:12.904
Lights out was five minutes ago.

39:12.906 --> 39:14.904
Oh, come on, we're camping out.

39:14.906 --> 39:18.584
The lights out rule applies
if you're inside or out.

39:18.586 --> 39:20.524
Besides, being that you're still grounded,

39:20.526 --> 39:22.143
you should be grateful I'm letting you

39:22.145 --> 39:23.687
have a friend stay over.

39:23.689 --> 39:25.267
Oh, yes, thank you for
letting me stay the night,

39:25.269 --> 39:27.064
Mrs. Kid West.

39:27.066 --> 39:28.733
I mean, Mrs. Cooper.

39:38.982 --> 39:40.078
We need to come up with a game plan

39:40.080 --> 39:41.737
to storm Braden's house.

39:41.739 --> 39:42.740
Again.

39:42.742 --> 39:44.259
But technically, you're still grounded.

39:44.261 --> 39:46.020
Technically, I'll be
hanging out with you,

39:46.022 --> 39:47.198
of which I have permission.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.040
Technically, we have
permission to be in this tent.

39:49.042 --> 39:50.356
Technically, we'll just fold up the tent

39:50.358 --> 39:51.854
and bring it with us.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.337
Technically, I don't think that works.

39:53.339 --> 39:56.231
Technically, we have
a curse on our hands.

39:56.233 --> 39:57.064
Good point.

39:57.066 --> 39:59.983
And no flashlights either.

40:19.227 --> 40:20.841
What do you think?

40:20.843 --> 40:22.441
That'll work.

40:22.443 --> 40:23.902
This time we'll do it right.

40:23.904 --> 40:25.465
My mom won't be back for an hour or two.

40:25.467 --> 40:27.643
That should give us plenty of time.

40:28.426 --> 40:29.427
Hey.

40:29.429 --> 40:30.679
I'm home early.

40:35.279 --> 40:36.112
Hello?

40:55.189 --> 40:56.022
Harper?

41:01.848 --> 41:02.848
Afternoon.

41:04.603 --> 41:06.702
Didn't mean to startle you.

41:06.704 --> 41:08.686
I just felt obligated to drop by

41:08.688 --> 41:10.628
and mention that Harper
has been hanging out

41:10.630 --> 41:14.138
with a certain Angela Little Sky.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.900
Yeah, Angie stayed over last night.

41:16.902 --> 41:18.069
Did she now?

41:18.906 --> 41:20.665
Is that a problem?

41:20.667 --> 41:22.197
Well, it's just that her uncle Jeremiah

41:22.199 --> 41:24.532
is a bit of a trouble maker.

41:25.446 --> 41:28.025
He spent six months in
county a few years back.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.321
Okay.

41:29.323 --> 41:32.425
Sounds like he paid his debt to society.

41:32.427 --> 41:35.863
But I bet you wanna know what he did.

41:35.865 --> 41:37.726
Has he harmed any children?

41:37.728 --> 41:39.364
No, nothing like that.

41:39.366 --> 41:42.564
Has he been in trouble with
the law since his arrest?

41:42.566 --> 41:44.286
Well no, but.

41:44.288 --> 41:48.308
Then it sounds like none of my business.

41:48.310 --> 41:49.305
Yeah, well.

41:49.307 --> 41:51.070
Be that as it may, I stopped by his house

41:51.072 --> 41:54.222
and he accused Braden
Meyers of stealing that key

41:54.224 --> 41:56.382
from the museum.

41:56.384 --> 41:57.741
Is that the same boy Harper accused

41:57.743 --> 41:59.161
of stealing that key?

41:59.163 --> 42:00.441
Yup.

42:00.443 --> 42:03.001
I told Jeremiah the same thing I told you,

42:03.003 --> 42:04.753
it was the wrong key.

42:06.203 --> 42:08.953
I thought you said
you didn't find any key.

42:10.827 --> 42:13.085
Anyway, I'm sure

42:13.087 --> 42:15.202
you're smart enough to
choose the right company

42:15.204 --> 42:16.526
for your daughter.

42:16.528 --> 42:20.160
I just hope you do it sooner than later.

42:20.162 --> 42:21.495
Oh, before I go,

42:22.448 --> 42:23.604
my truck's been leaking.

42:23.606 --> 42:25.585
I can't seem to find out where.

42:25.587 --> 42:29.254
Would you happen to
have a rag I can borrow?

42:30.583 --> 42:31.833
Will this do?

42:33.088 --> 42:33.921
Perfect.

42:45.562 --> 42:46.812
Oh, good boy.

42:48.084 --> 42:51.117
Don't tell me you're
gonna drug him again.

42:51.119 --> 42:54.119
No, he just needed a little snack.

42:55.663 --> 42:58.830
Well, I can't say you're unprepared.

43:13.908 --> 43:15.357
Get the door.

43:15.374 --> 43:17.257
It's your house.

43:27.213 --> 43:28.449
Hey there, Pocahontas.

43:28.451 --> 43:30.305
I knew you'd come around eventually.

43:30.307 --> 43:33.447
Why don't you come over here
and give me a nice juicy kiss?

43:33.449 --> 43:35.809
How much juice would you prefer?

43:35.811 --> 43:38.353
As much as you got.

43:38.355 --> 43:39.188
Okay.

44:19.649 --> 44:22.974
Didn't your dad ever tell you
these things are dangerous?

44:29.756 --> 44:32.839
Let's go destroy us a cursed staff.

44:38.548 --> 44:40.607
My mom's home early.

44:41.082 --> 44:43.123
What's the Sheriff doing at your house?

44:43.125 --> 44:44.659
I don't know.

44:44.661 --> 44:46.994
Maybe he can give us a ride.

44:55.013 --> 44:57.175
Afternoon, Harper.

44:57.177 --> 44:58.274
Angela.

44:58.276 --> 44:59.756
Sheriff, we need your help.

44:59.758 --> 45:01.414
We found the key.

45:01.416 --> 45:02.249
And this.

45:05.817 --> 45:07.436
Braden must have hidden it from you.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.855
It happens to the best of us.

45:10.933 --> 45:12.933
So the staff is there.

45:14.816 --> 45:17.649
How do you know about the staff?

45:19.897 --> 45:20.814
You know,

45:22.180 --> 45:23.395
no one ever knew what happened

45:23.397 --> 45:26.257
to old Walter Smith's descendants.

45:26.259 --> 45:29.176
Except, of course, his descendants.

45:30.416 --> 45:31.249
You?

45:33.118 --> 45:35.171
You're a smart one, Harper.

45:35.530 --> 45:37.774
Don't go after that staff, Sheriff.

45:38.157 --> 45:40.194
Says the expert.

45:40.377 --> 45:41.954
You people think you're so wise,

45:41.956 --> 45:44.556
but you can barely even survive.

45:44.648 --> 45:46.018
I'll say this for you though,

45:46.020 --> 45:48.175
you know how to hold a grudge.

45:48.177 --> 45:50.413
But even there, I have you beat.

45:50.415 --> 45:53.115
Your ancestor cursed my family,

45:53.117 --> 45:55.317
and now I'm gonna curse yours.

46:00.407 --> 46:01.240
Mom!

46:07.423 --> 46:09.021
Like I told you, boy,

46:09.023 --> 46:11.464
your grandpa knows what he's doing.

46:11.466 --> 46:12.299
Grandpa?

46:13.525 --> 46:17.159
You three are under arrest
for the theft of this key.

46:19.158 --> 46:21.798
No need for the grim faces, ladies.

46:21.800 --> 46:23.544
Soon as we get the staff,
we'll come right back

46:23.546 --> 46:26.854
and upgrade you to a nice
comfortable jail cell.

46:27.562 --> 46:29.063
If I wasn't a young lady with manners,

46:29.065 --> 46:31.897
I'd say you deserve to be cursed.

46:31.899 --> 46:33.704
You got the legend all wrong, Cowgirl.

46:33.706 --> 46:36.356
It's not evil the staff
brings, it's power.

46:40.474 --> 46:42.410
Guess it wasn't mean to to be, Pocahontas.

46:42.452 --> 46:43.869
In your dreams.

46:47.919 --> 46:52.086
Well, Harper, I'm disappointed
in my honorary deputy.

46:52.623 --> 46:56.584
You helped me out, but you
broke the law to do it.

46:56.586 --> 46:59.258
Now your mom's gonna lose
her job and the house too.

46:59.260 --> 47:03.427
But don't worry, I'm sure she
can write to you from prison.

47:17.681 --> 47:19.098
Come on, Mucus.

48:27.221 --> 48:30.613
That's one messed up
game of musical chairs.

48:31.882 --> 48:33.243
They're at least five
minutes ahead of us.

48:33.245 --> 48:35.745
Hopefully we can catch up to them.

48:40.932 --> 48:42.182
Come with us.

48:44.108 --> 48:46.303
When the time's right.

48:46.305 --> 48:47.972
Remember your gifts.

48:52.014 --> 48:53.958
Do not leave her side.

48:54.741 --> 48:56.324
Count on it.

49:16.343 --> 49:18.564
In a few miles, we
cross timber creek bridge.

49:18.566 --> 49:21.385
Then we go off road and head east.

49:21.387 --> 49:23.898
The cavern shouldn't
be too far from there.

49:23.900 --> 49:25.721
That is if I'm reading this thing right.

49:25.723 --> 49:27.305
Well, of course you are.

49:27.307 --> 49:31.474
You're a sharp young fella
with a lot of potential.

49:37.311 --> 49:38.973
How much further is it?

49:38.975 --> 49:41.453
In a little while, we'll
reach a small bridge.

49:41.455 --> 49:43.027
Then we'll be close.

49:43.477 --> 49:45.794
I see the Sheriff on that other road.

49:49.386 --> 49:50.707
Hey, they're gaining on us.

49:50.709 --> 49:51.727
Who?

49:51.743 --> 49:53.419
Who do you think?

49:54.011 --> 49:56.052
I wouldn't worry about it.

50:10.212 --> 50:13.596
Isn't there supposed to
be a bridge on this road?

50:17.117 --> 50:18.576
Isn't there another way around?

50:18.578 --> 50:20.911
Not unless we double back.

50:27.120 --> 50:27.953
Oh no.

50:45.316 --> 50:47.290
Looks like this truck's
got some life left in her.

51:07.128 --> 51:08.328
Where to?

51:08.330 --> 51:09.330
Follow me.

51:26.335 --> 51:28.918
Stay here and guard the door.

51:45.266 --> 51:48.262
Well now, looks like you
ladies here for some wings.

51:48.264 --> 51:50.237
You're gonna need 'em again.

51:50.239 --> 51:51.906
Time for lunch, boy.

51:53.064 --> 51:54.897
Hey there, handsome.

51:56.584 --> 51:58.751
Get 'em, you stupid dog!

51:59.939 --> 52:00.772
Get 'em.

52:33.184 --> 52:34.943
Let me have it.

52:34.945 --> 52:36.559
Just like you promised.

52:36.561 --> 52:38.623
All in good time, boy.

52:38.625 --> 52:41.275
I wouldn't touch that staff.

52:47.723 --> 52:48.985
If I were you, I'd get out of here

52:48.987 --> 52:51.021
while you still can, Cowgirl.

52:51.329 --> 52:54.463
Who told you the staff would
you give you power, Braden?

52:54.465 --> 52:55.965
Someone I trust.

52:58.001 --> 53:01.410
Did he tell you what
he was gonna use it for?

53:02.209 --> 53:04.422
Say goodbye to your girlfriend.

53:05.005 --> 53:05.838
What?

53:06.780 --> 53:08.658
What's she talking about?

53:09.425 --> 53:11.409
You wouldn't understand.

53:18.027 --> 53:19.327
I had high hopes for you,

53:19.329 --> 53:20.628
but it turns out you're a disappointment

53:20.630 --> 53:22.463
just like your father.

53:48.651 --> 53:50.901
Hold still, you low life.

54:01.661 --> 54:02.828
Hey Sheriff!

54:06.082 --> 54:07.889
Braden, let go of the staff.

54:08.155 --> 54:08.988
I can't!

54:16.351 --> 54:19.011
Angie, can you get it out of his hands?

54:19.336 --> 54:20.658
I don't know.

54:20.660 --> 54:22.243
I need your help.

55:08.596 --> 55:10.531
Braden, get her out of here.

55:10.533 --> 55:11.859
I don't take orders from you.

55:11.909 --> 55:15.284
Do you wanna see your
girlfriend go up in flames?

55:26.941 --> 55:29.102
Harper, what are you doing?

55:29.104 --> 55:30.547
I'll be right there.

55:30.549 --> 55:32.127
Get over here.

55:32.129 --> 55:33.296
In a minute.

55:34.482 --> 55:37.083
Harper, you leave that thing alone.

55:37.085 --> 55:38.085
No can do.

55:39.397 --> 55:40.614
Harper!

55:40.680 --> 55:41.847
You need it.

55:45.212 --> 55:46.321
Kid West!

55:52.008 --> 55:53.541
I need you more.

56:32.555 --> 56:35.282
We're gonna lose our
house again, aren't we?

56:35.832 --> 56:37.614
Why would you think that?

56:37.830 --> 56:39.574
I heard you on the phone.

56:39.624 --> 56:41.207
We can't afford it.

56:42.273 --> 56:44.931
You thought I was talking about my job?

56:45.606 --> 56:47.039
Weren't you?

56:47.406 --> 56:49.060
Oh, sweetheart.

56:49.569 --> 56:52.316
I was talking about your daddy's truck.

56:52.324 --> 56:55.882
It's on its last legs and
I can't afford to fix it.

56:56.582 --> 56:58.649
So we don't have to move?

57:02.982 --> 57:04.098
I'm sorry.

57:05.048 --> 57:06.273
For what?

57:07.040 --> 57:09.612
For trying to do your job.

57:09.995 --> 57:11.145
I trust you.

57:13.212 --> 57:14.045
It's just.

57:16.526 --> 57:19.109
But not like you trusted him.

57:23.129 --> 57:26.379
It's all right, you're in good company.

57:34.196 --> 57:36.362
I like your truck back there.

57:37.221 --> 57:38.054
95?

57:44.994 --> 57:47.213
Looks like it needs a little work.

57:48.147 --> 57:49.480
Looks like it.

57:50.687 --> 57:53.151
I know a place that offers a good deal.

57:53.725 --> 57:57.143
Oh, I appreciate it,
but we couldn't afford it.

57:57.784 --> 58:00.034
He said, "He knows a place."

59:05.489 --> 59:07.530
Thought you'd be in jail.

59:07.532 --> 59:09.192
Got off with a warning.

59:09.194 --> 59:11.635
Helped out with the investigation.

59:11.637 --> 59:14.232
You mean you sold out your
grandpa and your friends.

59:16.373 --> 59:18.823
I'm just a pragmatist.

59:19.994 --> 59:22.670
You don't even know
what that word means.

59:22.672 --> 59:23.788
Do too.

59:26.172 --> 59:28.755
Got something for you, Cowgirl.

59:32.608 --> 59:33.691
I found that.

59:34.360 --> 59:35.443
Lying around.

59:40.774 --> 59:42.456
Better watch out, Cowgirl.

59:42.458 --> 59:44.958
I still own this neighborhood.

59:46.205 --> 59:47.038
You too.

59:50.164 --> 59:50.997
Angie.

01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:09.479
Hey!

01:00:10.937 --> 01:00:11.770
Hey!

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.793
Excuse me, are you Kid West?

01:00:15.795 --> 01:00:17.676
Sure am, is everything all right?

01:00:17.678 --> 01:00:18.751
You wouldn't believe it.

01:00:18.753 --> 01:00:19.851
But over at the junior high field,

01:00:19.853 --> 01:00:22.476
a whole swarm of bullies
stopped our fun loving game

01:00:22.478 --> 01:00:24.325
of one hand touch football.

01:00:24.327 --> 01:00:25.527
What do they want?

01:00:25.635 --> 01:00:27.327
Well, you see,

01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:28.578
they've turned one of the goal posts

01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.094
into a giant sling shot.

01:00:30.096 --> 01:00:31.465
And they threatened to launch my friends

01:00:31.467 --> 01:00:33.727
one by one until we surrender the field.

01:00:34.102 --> 01:00:35.163
How many bullies?

01:00:35.413 --> 01:00:36.580
45 at least.

01:00:39.263 --> 01:00:40.430
We're on it.

01:00:40.744 --> 01:00:41.577
Okay.

01:00:44.131 --> 01:00:47.443
45 bullies, could be
our biggest battle ever.

01:00:47.668 --> 01:00:49.625
I don't know, Little Sky.

01:00:49.758 --> 01:00:51.925
The summer's not over yet.
