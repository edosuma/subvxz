WEBVTT

00:01.622 --> 00:03.373
It's not Woodall
coming after us.

00:03.424 --> 00:04.624
It's--
Sean Cahill.

00:04.658 --> 00:07.127
Welcome to the new S.E.C.

00:07.161 --> 00:08.795
We target law firms.

00:08.829 --> 00:10.680
- Mr. Forstman.
- No.

00:10.715 --> 00:13.550
You'll miss the opportunity
to get back at Harvey Specter.

00:13.601 --> 00:15.018
You've got my 230 mil.

00:15.052 --> 00:18.388
Once the deal closes,
you cut Sidwell out.

00:18.439 --> 00:20.940
What happened to "You think
I'm staying if you leave"?

00:20.975 --> 00:22.025
Yeah, that was before I knew

00:22.059 --> 00:23.443
you were gonna
screw over Sidwell.

00:23.477 --> 00:24.978
Forstman doesn't throw
money around

00:25.012 --> 00:26.512
without getting something
in return.

00:26.530 --> 00:27.864
I have no other choice!

00:27.898 --> 00:30.349
So we're just gonna go
back and forth trading favors?

00:30.368 --> 00:31.985
Are you my lawyer or not?

00:32.019 --> 00:35.488
Seriously, Rachel, I couldn't
have done it without you.

00:35.522 --> 00:38.241
Logan, I should go.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.711 --> 01:00.680
Mike?

01:00.714 --> 01:01.714
Right here.

01:01.715 --> 01:03.316
- Did you turn off my alarm?
- I did.

01:03.350 --> 01:04.684
It's after 9:00.

01:04.718 --> 01:05.685
I have been sleeping for--

01:05.719 --> 01:06.770
Almost six hours.

01:06.821 --> 01:07.821
I know.

01:07.822 --> 01:09.022
And the truth is,
you need more.

01:09.056 --> 01:10.273
Why would you do that?

01:10.324 --> 01:11.858
Rachel, you've been
running back and forth

01:11.892 --> 01:13.532
between school and the firm
like a maniac.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.577
I don't even remember
the last time

01:14.612 --> 01:15.862
you got a good night's sleep.

01:15.896 --> 01:17.330
It doesn't give you
the right to do that.

01:17.364 --> 01:18.748
Plus, Harvey's gonna kill me.
He'll get over it.

01:18.783 --> 01:19.949
And I've got three briefs
to write,

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
plus a paper for torts

01:21.001 --> 01:23.203
and a contracts exam tomorrow.

01:23.237 --> 01:24.704
I don't have the luxury
to sleep in.

01:24.738 --> 01:27.540
Then you need to ask Harvey
for a day off this week.

01:27.574 --> 01:30.343
Did he ever give you time off
because you were overworked?

01:32.513 --> 01:34.080
- No, he didn't.
- Exactly.

01:34.098 --> 01:38.551
I don't want to be
any different.

01:38.585 --> 01:40.804
Mr. Jamieson,
you are hereby remanded

01:40.855 --> 01:44.307
to the federal penitentiary
in Danbury, Connecticut.

01:49.897 --> 01:52.365
You might want to call me
about an appeal.

01:52.399 --> 01:56.102
The prosecutor has a reputation
for bending the rules.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.604
You must be
the infamous Harvey Specter.

01:58.622 --> 02:01.574
And you must be the chump
Eric Woodall ordered

02:01.608 --> 02:02.826
to come after me.

02:02.877 --> 02:04.294
Chump's my name
on my mother's side.

02:04.328 --> 02:05.462
I do prefer Cahill.

02:05.496 --> 02:07.130
And I prefer you stop
manufacturing bullshit

02:07.164 --> 02:08.548
to get my clients
to turn on me.

02:08.582 --> 02:10.782
I'm sorry, I'm not in
the manufacturing business.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.552
I'm just a humble civil servant.

02:12.586 --> 02:13.953
And if you're as clean
as you say you are,

02:13.971 --> 02:15.588
your clients won't have anything
to give us.

02:15.622 --> 02:17.390
Unless you bully them
into making things up.

02:17.424 --> 02:19.092
Oh, see, now I think
you've got us confused,

02:19.126 --> 02:20.643
because that sounds like
something that you might do.

02:20.678 --> 02:23.229
The point is, Sean,
you had a secret little plan,

02:23.264 --> 02:25.431
and I've taken away
your element of surprise.

02:25.465 --> 02:26.465
Have you?

02:26.466 --> 02:27.484
You may know I'm coming,

02:27.518 --> 02:29.519
but do you know
where or when?

02:29.570 --> 02:32.272
See, while you're battening down
the hatches at B-4,

02:32.306 --> 02:33.907
I might be at D-12 or H-3,

02:33.941 --> 02:37.193
and before you know it,
I have sunk your battleship.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.644
That's a cute game.

02:38.662 --> 02:42.031
I was more of a rock 'em
sock 'em robots guy.

02:42.082 --> 02:44.117
So you think you can knock
my block off, Harvey?

02:44.151 --> 02:47.337
I know I can, because I had
Eric Woodall fired.

02:47.371 --> 02:49.488
So stay the hell away
from my clients,

02:49.507 --> 02:52.876
or I'll pave
the same career path for you.

02:52.927 --> 02:55.929
Okay, your hands weren't full
with Eric.

02:55.963 --> 02:59.382
They will be full with me.

02:59.433 --> 03:01.434
Harv.

03:07.725 --> 03:09.175
You want to talk about it?

03:09.193 --> 03:10.360
Talk about what?

03:10.394 --> 03:14.113
That 10,000-pound weight
on your shoulders.

03:14.148 --> 03:15.481
Mike, if you feel this way now,

03:15.515 --> 03:17.534
what are you gonna feel like
when you cut Sidwell out?

03:17.568 --> 03:20.620
If I cut him out.

03:20.654 --> 03:21.955
What are you talking about?

03:21.989 --> 03:23.323
I've been thinking about it.

03:23.357 --> 03:26.960
I haven't actually
taken Forstman's money yet.

03:26.994 --> 03:29.546
If I can get Harvey
to back off before I do,

03:29.580 --> 03:31.414
then I might not even need it.

03:31.465 --> 03:33.833
You want to use the idea
of Forstman's money

03:33.867 --> 03:34.867
to cut a deal.

03:34.885 --> 03:37.170
But, Mike, they have money too.

03:37.204 --> 03:39.505
Yeah, which they can't spend
until their T.R.O. expires.

03:39.539 --> 03:41.307
Yeah, but that's next week,
and it's not like

03:41.342 --> 03:44.427
there's some huge block
of shares available now.

03:53.604 --> 03:55.488
Wexler's merging
two of their funds.

03:55.522 --> 03:56.689
So what?

03:56.723 --> 03:58.724
So their investment parameters
don't allow

03:58.742 --> 04:00.063
for more than 4%
of their holdings

04:00.077 --> 04:02.662
in any one industry.

04:02.696 --> 04:05.198
They have to sell
a block of something.

04:05.232 --> 04:06.866
But how do you know
it's gonna be Gillis Industries?

04:06.900 --> 04:09.502
Because I did the math.
That's what I would do.

04:09.536 --> 04:11.004
You think Harvey
will go for it?

04:11.038 --> 04:13.923
There's only one way
to find out.

04:19.129 --> 04:20.745
Hey, I don't have
any cash on me,

04:20.764 --> 04:22.215
but if you want
to bring my luggage up,

04:22.249 --> 04:23.370
I'll get you
on the way back.

04:23.384 --> 04:25.101
Nah, you know what?
That's okay.

04:25.135 --> 04:26.886
I don't need a tip
now that I have enough money

04:26.920 --> 04:27.937
to buy your whole building.

04:27.972 --> 04:30.089
Yeah, what are you doing here,
Mike?

04:30.107 --> 04:31.975
Well, you came to give me
some friendly advice.

04:32.026 --> 04:33.476
I thought
I would return the favor.

04:33.527 --> 04:35.061
I don't remember asking.

04:35.095 --> 04:37.647
Mm, yeah, neither did I.

04:37.698 --> 04:40.033
Walk away, Harvey.

04:40.067 --> 04:41.067
Excuse me?

04:41.068 --> 04:42.735
You're gonna lose.

04:42.769 --> 04:45.955
If you think you getting
a little loan is gonna stop me,

04:45.990 --> 04:47.407
I didn't teach you much.

04:47.441 --> 04:49.742
It's not a little loan.

04:49.776 --> 04:51.794
I've got one of the most
powerful players in the world

04:51.829 --> 04:52.912
behind me.

04:52.946 --> 04:54.386
Which is exactly
where he needs to be

04:54.415 --> 04:56.782
to stab you in the back.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.085
Well, wherever he's standing,

04:59.119 --> 05:03.122
this is what I'm prepared to
offer Logan Sanders to go away.

05:03.140 --> 05:04.623
I know I don't
need to remind you

05:04.642 --> 05:08.645
that you're legally required
to run that by your client.

05:10.848 --> 05:12.348
I just ran it by him.

05:12.399 --> 05:13.966
No deal.
Harvey.

05:13.984 --> 05:15.935
You haven't taken
Forstman's money yet.

05:15.969 --> 05:17.803
He's got some kind of gun
to your head,

05:17.821 --> 05:20.523
and you're just trying to use
his promise of cash

05:20.574 --> 05:21.974
as leverage against me.

05:23.610 --> 05:24.694
This isn't a bluff, Harvey.

05:24.745 --> 05:26.195
I came here to give you
a way out.

05:26.246 --> 05:27.330
Bullshit.

05:27.364 --> 05:29.666
You came here to give yourself
a way out.

05:29.700 --> 05:33.586
But I wasn't born yesterday,
and I'm not giving it to you.

06:11.686 --> 06:13.937
Did you go to see Sean Cahill
in court this morning?

06:13.971 --> 06:15.805
I'm not in the mood
for a lecture.

06:15.823 --> 06:17.807
I'm not lecturing.
I'm asking you a question.

06:17.825 --> 06:19.976
Yes, I did,
and before you tell me

06:19.994 --> 06:21.514
this is what we brought
Malone in for--

06:21.529 --> 06:22.495
I'm not going
to tell you that.

06:22.530 --> 06:23.747
Good, because--

06:23.781 --> 06:24.748
Now Cahill's coming
directly after you.

06:24.782 --> 06:25.782
Exactly.

06:25.783 --> 06:26.783
And you're on your way

06:26.817 --> 06:28.337
to tell Malone
to concoct some bullshit

06:28.369 --> 06:30.086
to legally get us
that Wexler block.

06:30.121 --> 06:31.821
Look who's been
reading the papers.

06:31.839 --> 06:33.919
I'm not the only one
who can read the papers, Harvey.

06:33.924 --> 06:36.492
So can you.
So can Mike Ross.

06:36.510 --> 06:37.827
He's gonna go
after those shares.

06:37.845 --> 06:39.929
- He is now.
- What are you talking about?

06:39.964 --> 06:41.681
- He tried to buy us off.
- And you turned him down.

06:41.716 --> 06:43.466
Yes, which is why
I'm going to see Malone.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.385
- No, you're not.
- Jessica, we have to--

06:45.436 --> 06:46.770
I'm not saying we don't.

06:46.804 --> 06:50.023
I'm saying I'm going to be
the one to do it.

06:50.057 --> 06:51.191
You know
he's not gonna like it.

06:51.225 --> 06:52.776
He doesn't have to like it.

06:52.810 --> 06:54.944
He has to do it.

06:56.230 --> 06:59.115
Therefore, prepare thee
to cut off the flesh.

06:59.150 --> 07:03.019
Shed thou no blood,
nor cut thou less nor more.

07:03.037 --> 07:05.905
But just a pound of flesh if--

07:05.956 --> 07:09.025
Louis, how long have you been
standing there?

07:09.043 --> 07:10.794
Long enough
to become part of you.

07:10.828 --> 07:12.195
Okay, you know what?

07:12.213 --> 07:13.663
I don't have time
for you to be creepy.

07:13.697 --> 07:15.198
So does this mean
you're doing theater again?

07:15.216 --> 07:16.883
Yes, I am playing Portia
in <i>merchant of Venice.</i>

07:16.917 --> 07:18.051
Now, can you please just
let me get back to--

07:18.085 --> 07:19.836
Holy shit, Donna,
that is a meaty part.

07:19.870 --> 07:23.223
Yeah, it's 588 lines,
which I have yet to memorize.

07:23.257 --> 07:24.257
Wait.

07:24.258 --> 07:25.258
So you're not off book?

07:25.259 --> 07:26.676
Louis, if I were off book,

07:26.710 --> 07:28.144
would I be pacing around
the copy room

07:28.179 --> 07:29.179
with a script in my hand?

07:29.180 --> 07:30.220
All right, just calm down.

07:30.231 --> 07:31.231
No need to panic.

07:31.232 --> 07:32.315
When do you open?
Tonight.

07:32.349 --> 07:33.683
Tonight,
and you're not off book?

07:33.717 --> 07:34.934
What the hell's wrong with you,
Donna?

07:34.985 --> 07:36.052
- Okay, this isn't helping.
- I'm sorry.

07:36.070 --> 07:37.187
I didn't mean to be--
I knew it.

07:37.221 --> 07:38.405
I bit off
more than I could chew.

07:38.439 --> 07:40.323
No, no, no, no, no, no,
just relax, okay?

07:40.357 --> 07:41.574
I don't care
if it takes all day.

07:41.609 --> 07:45.028
We are gonna memorize
these lines together.

07:45.062 --> 07:47.330
- Thank you, Louis.
- No need.

07:47.364 --> 07:49.165
For one canst choke
on the joy of life

07:49.200 --> 07:50.750
without thy mouth full.

07:50.785 --> 07:52.252
Is that the bard?

07:52.286 --> 07:53.286
Nope, it's the Litt,

07:53.287 --> 07:55.171
and roughly translated,
it means,

07:55.206 --> 07:58.708
when we're done, you're gonna
kick Shakespeare's ass.

08:01.411 --> 08:03.379
Milady.

08:07.017 --> 08:08.268
I take it
it didn't go well.

08:08.302 --> 08:09.686
What gave it away?

08:09.720 --> 08:11.354
Because I know you,
and you don't have your usual

08:11.388 --> 08:14.307
"I'm super cool Mike Ross"
face.

08:14.358 --> 08:15.424
If you knew me that well,

08:15.443 --> 08:18.728
you'd know
I'm not in the mood.

08:18.762 --> 08:19.946
Mike, I'm not your enemy,

08:19.980 --> 08:23.483
and I don't appreciate
being treated like I am.

08:23.534 --> 08:24.534
I know.

08:24.535 --> 08:26.703
I'm sorry.

08:26.737 --> 08:28.288
So what did Harvey say?

08:28.322 --> 08:29.883
It's not what he said.
It's what he did.

08:29.907 --> 08:31.991
He knew what I was trying to do,

08:32.042 --> 08:33.793
and he called my bluff
right there.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.945
He didn't even share the offer
with Logan?

08:35.962 --> 08:36.962
No, he didn't.

08:36.964 --> 08:38.047
But you said he had to.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.883
You want me to sue him
for that?

08:39.917 --> 08:41.000
So what are you gonna do?

08:41.051 --> 08:42.085
You know what I'm gonna do.

08:42.119 --> 08:43.470
- Mike.
- I don't want to hear it.

08:43.504 --> 08:45.054
I wasn't disapproving.

08:45.089 --> 08:48.457
I just want to make sure you've
exhausted all your options.

08:48.476 --> 08:49.976
- I have.
- Then maybe you can--

08:50.010 --> 08:52.395
Amy, the second I bid
on that block of shares,

08:52.429 --> 08:53.963
I've already taken
Forstman's money.

08:56.817 --> 08:59.936
Mike Ross' office.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.738
I'll tell him.

09:01.772 --> 09:03.439
Sidwell?

09:03.473 --> 09:05.942
He wants to see you.

09:15.152 --> 09:16.152
You look good.

09:16.153 --> 09:18.004
This isn't a social call.

09:18.038 --> 09:19.789
All right,
I take it back.

09:19.823 --> 09:21.090
Wexler is divesting

09:21.125 --> 09:22.759
a huge block
of Gillis Industries,

09:22.793 --> 09:24.511
and I need you to find
a creative way

09:24.545 --> 09:25.962
to buy them for Logan Sanders.

09:25.996 --> 09:28.298
If I'm not mistaken,
Logan Sanders has a T.R.O.

09:28.332 --> 09:30.967
that actually prohibits him from
buying any additional shares.

09:31.001 --> 09:32.218
Which is why
you're going to set up a trust

09:32.269 --> 09:33.353
for us to buy it for him.

09:33.387 --> 09:34.837
That's called parking,
Jessica.

09:34.855 --> 09:36.022
I know what it's called.

09:36.056 --> 09:37.607
Then maybe you also know
it's illegal.

09:37.641 --> 09:39.342
I know it can be illegal,

09:39.360 --> 09:41.811
and I need you to figure out
a way to make it questionable.

09:41.845 --> 09:43.512
And here I thought
you came in here

09:43.531 --> 09:45.681
to tell me how much fun
last night was.

09:45.699 --> 09:47.534
Oh, speaking of last night,

09:47.568 --> 09:49.685
you said you blamed yourself

09:49.703 --> 09:53.156
for helping Cahill
drop those cases.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.375
So here's your chance
to make up for it.

09:55.409 --> 09:56.525
Remind me never to have

09:56.544 --> 09:58.461
a moment of self-reflection
around you.

09:58.495 --> 10:00.997
I'm not using this
as ammunition.

10:01.031 --> 10:02.698
I am using it as motivation.

10:02.716 --> 10:05.552
So figure out a way
to set up the trust,

10:05.586 --> 10:06.702
and do it quickly,

10:06.720 --> 10:10.173
because we're running
out of time.

10:18.715 --> 10:21.050
You wanted to see me?

10:21.068 --> 10:22.068
Come here.

10:22.069 --> 10:24.771
I want to show you something.

10:30.727 --> 10:33.613
Lionsdale Electronics,
3 million shares,

10:33.664 --> 10:34.897
bought out by management.

10:34.915 --> 10:37.834
My first LBO.
I was right out of school.

10:37.868 --> 10:40.336
All I wanted was that first
tombstone because it meant--

10:40.371 --> 10:44.740
- Your first deal.
- Broke my cherry.

10:44.758 --> 10:45.758
Must have been nice.

10:45.759 --> 10:48.911
It was.

10:48.929 --> 10:51.097
But you know what the difference
between you and me is?

10:51.131 --> 10:52.215
I was just an analyst.

10:52.249 --> 10:53.433
I mean, sure,
I did all the work,

10:53.467 --> 10:54.601
but I didn't do any of the work.

10:54.635 --> 10:56.185
Know what I mean?

10:56.220 --> 10:57.637
- Jonathan.
- Don't be modest.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.055
I know I've been on your case,

10:59.089 --> 11:02.108
but the truth is,
you made this all happen.

11:02.142 --> 11:04.110
I haven't made
anything happen yet.

11:04.144 --> 11:06.095
No, you haven't.

11:06.113 --> 11:09.616
And there's a rule against
giving out tombstones too early.

11:09.650 --> 11:12.601
You're not
supposed to jinx it.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.954
But there's no rule
against this.

11:14.989 --> 11:16.990
We'll fill it in later.

11:22.329 --> 11:23.663
Thank you, Jonathan.

11:23.714 --> 11:26.449
You're welcome.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.501
Now go bring this bad boy home.

11:48.658 --> 11:50.191
Rachel, they loved it.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.828
We are gonna go after Piedmont
in a week.

11:52.862 --> 11:54.212
We're gonna have
a lot of work to do.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.998
Give me a call when you get in.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.344
Harvey,
can I help you with something?

12:09.378 --> 12:10.578
Yes, you can help
by telling me

12:10.596 --> 12:12.013
how much longer it's gonna take

12:12.047 --> 12:14.349
for you to find me a way
to bid on that stock.

12:14.383 --> 12:16.384
It's going to take
as long as it takes.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.320
Well, it better not be
more than a day,

12:18.354 --> 12:20.021
or I won't need it at all.

12:20.055 --> 12:22.824
It's so good to hear this
from the horse's mouth.

12:22.859 --> 12:24.159
What's that supposed to mean?

12:24.193 --> 12:26.278
It means the next time
you want me to break the law,

12:26.329 --> 12:28.029
at least have the balls
to ask me yourself.

12:28.063 --> 12:29.331
The balls?

12:29.365 --> 12:32.417
First off, Jessica insisted
on asking you herself,

12:32.451 --> 12:34.753
and I agreed with her,
because we're on the same page.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.538
And nobody's asking you
to break the law.

12:36.572 --> 12:37.923
We're telling you
to sidestep it.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.958
That's not the job
I signed on for.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.543
The job you signed on for

12:41.577 --> 12:43.077
is the job we tell you
you signed on for.

12:43.095 --> 12:44.913
Well, that's
a bullshit justification,

12:44.931 --> 12:45.931
and you know it.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.382
What I know is,
there's a reason

12:47.416 --> 12:49.100
we make the kind of money we do.

12:49.135 --> 12:52.354
It's because we figure out a way
to get things like this done.

12:52.388 --> 12:56.141
So stop questioning my integrity
and start doing your job.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.440
Harvey, do you have a second?

13:02.448 --> 13:03.448
That's about all I have.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.766
All right,
I was wondering if--

13:04.784 --> 13:05.984
if maybe I could possibly just--

13:06.035 --> 13:07.152
Time's up.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.937
Could I get a day or two off?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.071
A day or two?

13:10.105 --> 13:11.105
A day.

13:11.106 --> 13:12.607
I just need one day away.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.942
Are you sure
that's all you need?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.043
I'm sure.

13:15.077 --> 13:17.295
Would you also like me
to make your bed?

13:17.330 --> 13:18.630
What?

13:18.664 --> 13:20.584
Maybe I can triple your salary
while we're at it.

13:20.616 --> 13:21.950
No, that's not--

13:21.968 --> 13:24.669
No, really, what can I do
to make your life easier?

13:24.720 --> 13:26.004
That is not fair.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.122
I have been juggling work
and school for months now,

13:28.140 --> 13:29.591
and I-I haven't asked
for any special treatment.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.259
You're asking now.

13:31.293 --> 13:32.811
I'm not asking for time off

13:32.845 --> 13:34.095
to go to the Hamptons.

13:34.129 --> 13:35.897
This is law school
I'm talking about.

13:35.932 --> 13:37.065
You said a day away.

13:37.099 --> 13:38.433
You didn't say anything
about law school.

13:38.467 --> 13:39.507
Well, it's for law school.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.236
Well, this is your law school.

13:41.270 --> 13:43.438
This, right here.

13:43.472 --> 13:45.156
And by the way,
we're paying you for it.

13:45.191 --> 13:46.775
I know,
and I'm grateful.

13:46.809 --> 13:48.827
If you're grateful,
then you'll stop complaining

13:48.861 --> 13:50.412
about how much work
you have to do,

13:50.446 --> 13:52.197
and you'll figure out
how to best manage your time,

13:52.248 --> 13:55.000
but as far as getting time off,
that's not gonna happen

13:55.034 --> 13:56.434
if you still plan on
working for me.

13:56.452 --> 13:58.253
Now, you still need
a day or two off?

13:58.287 --> 14:00.622
No, I can manage.

14:08.130 --> 14:10.548
Thou shalt have nothing
but the forfeiture

14:10.599 --> 14:13.167
to be so taken
at thy peril, Jew.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.136
Why, then, let the devil
give him good of it.

14:15.170 --> 14:18.940
I'll stay no longer question.

14:18.975 --> 14:20.275
Come on, let's go.
This be-eth awesome.

14:20.309 --> 14:21.526
Where's your script?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.111
I don't need a script.
I'm off book.

14:23.145 --> 14:24.863
How can you be off book?
You're not even in the play.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.115
Because I know
all of Willy's work by heart.

14:27.149 --> 14:30.351
- All 37 plays?
- Mm-hmm.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.653
<i>Troilus and Cressida.</i>

14:31.687 --> 14:34.990
For to be wise and love
exceeds man's might.

14:35.024 --> 14:36.207
<i>Titus Andronicus.</i>

14:36.242 --> 14:38.827
Vengeance is in my heart,
death in my hand.

14:38.861 --> 14:41.546
Blood and revenge
are hammering in my head.

14:41.580 --> 14:42.580
What--what's the matter?

14:42.581 --> 14:45.000
Are you kidding me?

14:45.034 --> 14:47.719
You have every word this man's
ever written memorized,

14:47.753 --> 14:48.920
and I'm on
in an hour and a half,

14:48.971 --> 14:50.371
and I'm gonna
make a fool of myself.

14:50.372 --> 14:51.806
Donna, forget
about my extraordinary gift

14:51.841 --> 14:53.091
and focus on yourself.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.726
We have done this whole play.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.678
You know your part.
It will be fine.

14:56.712 --> 14:59.647
- It's not gonna be fine.
- Donna.

14:59.682 --> 15:01.316
I haven't been on the stage
in years.

15:01.350 --> 15:02.684
So you're nervous.

15:02.718 --> 15:05.353
All great performers
get nervous.

15:05.387 --> 15:06.855
It brings out the genius.

15:06.889 --> 15:09.607
What if I'm not genius?
What if I'm not even good?

15:13.395 --> 15:16.081
I was pretty damn good, Louis.

15:16.115 --> 15:19.067
I was.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.735
But I knew the odds
of somebody making it

15:20.753 --> 15:25.040
were close to zero
no matter how good they were.

15:25.074 --> 15:27.258
My father lost our money
when I was 13,

15:27.293 --> 15:30.912
and I-I found out
what it was like to struggle,

15:30.930 --> 15:36.101
so instead
of pursuing my dream,

15:36.135 --> 15:38.520
I chose this...

15:40.422 --> 15:41.639
And that let me pretend

15:41.690 --> 15:44.893
that maybe I was good enough
to make it.

15:48.097 --> 15:51.149
But what if I wasn't?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.367
Mm-mm, all right, look,

15:52.401 --> 15:53.735
I'm gonna tell you
something about myself

15:53.769 --> 15:56.771
that I never told anyone.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.324
I have stage fright.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.159
Got it when I was
in third grade.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.129
Let it get the best of me.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.082
I never got over it.

16:07.116 --> 16:10.552
And I cannot let you
make the same mistake.

16:11.587 --> 16:14.589
- But--
- Look at me.

16:14.623 --> 16:18.292
Donna Victoria Paulsen,

16:18.310 --> 16:21.346
you have never been
more beautiful

16:21.397 --> 16:24.599
and talented

16:24.633 --> 16:28.820
and perfect than you are
at this very moment.

16:28.854 --> 16:31.856
Your time is now.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.742
And you're gonna kill it.

16:34.777 --> 16:35.777
Thank you, Louis.

16:35.778 --> 16:38.780
No.

16:38.814 --> 16:41.916
Thank you.

16:41.951 --> 16:44.786
My middle name is Roberta.

16:46.488 --> 16:49.757
I'm so sorry for that.

16:53.996 --> 16:56.464
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:58.467 --> 16:59.667
Were you working late?

16:59.685 --> 17:02.220
You really have to ask?

17:02.271 --> 17:06.858
Thought maybe it would be nice
for us to lie down a little bit.

17:06.892 --> 17:10.728
Together.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.063
I would love that,

17:12.114 --> 17:15.483
but if I lie down,
I probably won't get back up.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.124
I know you don't want
to hear this,

17:23.159 --> 17:25.460
but I was thinking about it,

17:25.493 --> 17:29.197
and Harvey did kind of
give me special treatment.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.217
- Mike.
- He let me skip law school.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.338
Yeah.

17:37.372 --> 17:38.640
Hey.

17:38.674 --> 17:41.709
Maybe if you just find
the right time to ask, you know.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.763
I did,
and he bit my head off.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.018
So please just let it go.

17:50.052 --> 17:52.520
Okay?
Okay.

17:52.554 --> 17:55.273
Just wish all this Harvey
and Logan bullshit

17:55.324 --> 17:57.609
would be over.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.162
Yeah, me too.

18:01.197 --> 18:02.230
Maybe when it is,

18:02.248 --> 18:05.399
we can get out of town
for a weekend.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.919
I would love that.

18:23.538 --> 18:25.475
I'm worried Cahill, Harvey.

18:25.685 --> 18:27.386
I've checked
with everyone I know.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.553
He hasn't done a thing.

18:28.587 --> 18:30.472
Me too, which is exactly
why I'm worried.

18:30.523 --> 18:31.890
Jessica, I don't know
what to say.

18:31.924 --> 18:34.109
If I have to look over
my shoulder every 15 seconds,

18:34.143 --> 18:35.593
I might as well
give up right now.

18:35.611 --> 18:37.779
Okay, but it doesn't mean
you stop looking altogether.

18:37.814 --> 18:40.198
Hey, do you have a minute?

18:40.233 --> 18:41.366
Did you set up that trust?

18:41.401 --> 18:43.568
- No.
- In that case, we don't.

18:43.602 --> 18:44.736
I did something better.

18:44.770 --> 18:46.071
We're listening.

18:46.105 --> 18:48.273
One of the biggest red flags
at the S.E.C.

18:48.291 --> 18:51.043
is a stock purchase with money
kept in trust for clients.

18:51.077 --> 18:52.077
We've gone over this.

18:52.078 --> 18:54.112
Let him finish.

18:54.130 --> 18:55.714
On the other hand,

18:55.748 --> 18:58.283
there's nothing unusual
about a retainer.

18:58.301 --> 18:59.918
A retainer?

18:59.952 --> 19:01.086
From what I gather,

19:01.120 --> 19:03.221
this takeover is
a massive undertaking, right?

19:03.256 --> 19:04.973
Now, I don't know how you've
structured Logan's payments,

19:05.007 --> 19:07.959
but I think it's time he pay
this firm a hefty fee up front

19:07.977 --> 19:10.795
and something on the order
of $20 million.

19:10.813 --> 19:13.932
And we use $20 million of
our own money to buy that stock.

19:13.966 --> 19:15.350
There's nothing
that prohibits us

19:15.401 --> 19:17.235
from investing as a firm.

19:17.270 --> 19:18.937
And when the bulk
of our legal work is done,

19:18.971 --> 19:20.405
turns out
he has money coming back.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.574
We may just end up
giving him the shares

19:22.608 --> 19:24.242
instead of his unused retainer.

19:24.277 --> 19:25.477
Which we cannot plan

19:25.495 --> 19:27.312
or even discuss
with Logan Sanders in advance.

19:27.330 --> 19:28.780
And that makes it legal?

19:28.814 --> 19:31.533
No.

19:31.584 --> 19:33.702
It makes it questionable,

19:33.753 --> 19:35.537
because they still might
figure out what we did

19:35.588 --> 19:36.588
and make a case.

19:36.589 --> 19:37.839
We?

19:37.874 --> 19:40.258
You tell me, Harvey.

19:40.293 --> 19:42.294
Am I on the team now?

19:42.328 --> 19:43.512
Sounds like you're being

19:43.546 --> 19:45.464
a little bit of a dickhead
about this whole thing,

19:45.498 --> 19:49.601
so I'd say yes.

19:59.562 --> 20:01.897
Louis?

20:01.948 --> 20:02.981
Do you have a minute?

20:03.015 --> 20:04.316
Oh, no.

20:04.350 --> 20:05.683
It could not have been that bad.

20:05.701 --> 20:07.035
Oh, it wasn't.

20:07.069 --> 20:10.455
It was amazing.

20:10.490 --> 20:12.324
I mean,
it was like riding a bike.

20:12.358 --> 20:13.408
I got two standing Os,

20:13.459 --> 20:14.993
and I got you
to thank for it.

20:15.027 --> 20:17.212
Well, that's great.

20:17.246 --> 20:18.363
What's wrong?

20:18.381 --> 20:19.714
Shylock got drunk
at the after-party,

20:19.749 --> 20:21.917
fell down a flight of stairs,
and broke his ankle,

20:21.968 --> 20:24.503
which means the show
won't go on.

20:24.537 --> 20:27.038
No, no, no,
the show must go on.

20:27.056 --> 20:30.942
Well, the show can go on.

20:33.479 --> 20:35.514
- No.
- Louis.

20:35.548 --> 20:38.049
Come on, you're the only one
who can do it.

20:38.067 --> 20:41.570
No, I can't.

20:41.604 --> 20:44.105
I wanted to be a molar.

20:44.157 --> 20:46.408
But that teacher's pet,
Dorothy McHale, got the part,

20:46.442 --> 20:49.244
so I was forced to be plaque.

20:49.278 --> 20:51.913
Had to wear this ridiculous
flesh-colored unitard

20:51.948 --> 20:53.748
and drape myself
over my classmates,

20:53.783 --> 20:56.585
and every parent in the audience
laughed at me.

20:56.619 --> 20:57.836
Louis.

20:57.870 --> 20:59.004
And then the next year,
I got a bigger part.

20:59.038 --> 21:01.957
Walked right out onstage.

21:02.008 --> 21:05.460
Tommy Gallup screams out,
"plaque man!"

21:05.511 --> 21:08.463
Once again,
everyone laughs at me.

21:08.514 --> 21:13.101
So right then and there,
middle of the stage, I--

21:17.773 --> 21:21.560
I peed my pants.

21:21.594 --> 21:23.144
So I ran right off the stage,

21:23.196 --> 21:24.563
never went back,

21:24.597 --> 21:27.199
and I am not going back again.

21:27.233 --> 21:30.068
Louis.

21:30.102 --> 21:33.572
A part like this doesn't
come around very often.

21:33.606 --> 21:36.074
You gave me a gift,
and I killed it because of you.

21:36.108 --> 21:37.275
Donna, please.

21:37.293 --> 21:40.045
I'm not a lawyer, Louis.

21:41.497 --> 21:43.548
This is my chance to shine.

21:43.583 --> 21:48.503
But I'm about to lose
two more glorious nights.

21:50.473 --> 21:53.008
I've never asked anyone
for anything like this,

21:53.059 --> 21:55.810
but there's no other choice.

21:55.845 --> 21:58.430
Please do this for me.

22:02.318 --> 22:04.319
Please.

22:06.355 --> 22:07.805
You want me to sell
directly to you?

22:07.823 --> 22:08.823
I don't want you to.

22:08.824 --> 22:10.025
You're going to.

22:10.076 --> 22:11.493
Why would I do that?

22:11.527 --> 22:12.694
Because I'm the only one

22:12.745 --> 22:14.306
who's gonna buy your block
at a premium,

22:14.313 --> 22:15.997
instead of you flooding
the market with shares

22:16.032 --> 22:16.998
and ending up
getting a discount.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.917
That's funny.

22:18.951 --> 22:21.169
That's exactly what someone else
just told me an hour ago.

22:21.203 --> 22:22.254
What?

22:22.288 --> 22:23.705
And now I'll tell you
what I told him.

22:23.756 --> 22:25.123
I'll shut everyone else out,

22:25.157 --> 22:28.993
but you two are gonna
have to go head-to-head.

22:29.011 --> 22:31.212
You're talking
about a dark pool bidding war.

22:31.264 --> 22:32.347
That's no different

22:32.381 --> 22:33.682
than what you were
talking about.

22:33.716 --> 22:35.634
You just wanted to be
the only one bidding.

22:35.668 --> 22:37.769
Thanks for the scampi,
Mr. Ross.

22:37.803 --> 22:39.471
It was delicious.

22:39.505 --> 22:41.673
I'll be in touch
with the details.

22:41.691 --> 22:44.693
Who's the other entity?

22:44.727 --> 22:46.978
If you can't figure that out
for yourself,

22:47.012 --> 22:48.093
I don't think you're likely

22:48.114 --> 22:51.399
to come out on top
of this whole thing.

23:06.499 --> 23:07.832
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

23:07.866 --> 23:09.134
I think
I'm washing my hands,

23:09.168 --> 23:11.336
which I'd like to do
without you bothering me

23:11.370 --> 23:13.054
about whatever bullshit
you're here for.

23:13.089 --> 23:14.339
Bullshit?

23:14.373 --> 23:16.093
We'll see if the S.E.C.
thinks it's bullshit

23:16.142 --> 23:17.642
that you're
buying stock illegally.

23:17.677 --> 23:19.844
You're throwing some
pretty big accusations around

23:19.878 --> 23:20.895
for such a little guy.

23:20.930 --> 23:22.314
You think I didn't do
my homework?

23:22.348 --> 23:23.881
The registered bidder
traces back

23:23.899 --> 23:24.899
to a shell corporation

23:24.900 --> 23:26.935
we used six times last year.

23:26.986 --> 23:28.403
We're allowed to play
the stock market

23:28.437 --> 23:29.604
as much as the next fellow.

23:29.655 --> 23:31.356
You think
because you're using firm money,

23:31.390 --> 23:32.390
that makes it legal?

23:32.391 --> 23:33.775
Damn right I do,

23:33.826 --> 23:35.243
because we have no plan
to do anything

23:35.277 --> 23:37.245
other than keep those shares
ourselves.

23:37.279 --> 23:38.413
Now who's talking bullshit?

23:38.447 --> 23:40.031
What are you gonna do, Mike?

23:40.065 --> 23:41.533
You gonna run to the S.E.C.?

23:41.567 --> 23:43.702
You think I won't?

23:43.736 --> 23:45.370
These aren't your daddy's tapes,
Harvey.

23:45.404 --> 23:46.671
These are
the rules of the game.

23:46.706 --> 23:48.790
Then let me dial their number
for you,

23:48.841 --> 23:50.258
because if you report us,

23:50.292 --> 23:51.926
they'll put a freeze
on this sale,

23:51.961 --> 23:54.012
and by the time we get it
all straightened out,

23:54.046 --> 23:55.680
my T.R.O. will be expired,

23:55.715 --> 23:56.765
and we'll be right back

23:56.799 --> 24:00.218
to where we're headed
this afternoon.

24:02.638 --> 24:04.105
You're a sore goddamn loser.

24:04.140 --> 24:07.025
I would be if I ever lost.

24:07.059 --> 24:09.728
See you at 6:00.

24:12.264 --> 24:13.565
Guess what
piece of shit lawyer

24:13.599 --> 24:15.533
just got himself a seat
in the Wexler pool.

24:15.568 --> 24:16.768
Mike, what are you doing here?

24:16.769 --> 24:17.769
What do you mean?

24:17.770 --> 24:18.953
The sale's not until 6:00.

24:18.988 --> 24:20.288
Didn't you check
your messages?

24:20.322 --> 24:21.322
No. Why?

24:21.323 --> 24:23.992
Columbia University called.

24:24.043 --> 24:27.295
Rachel was taken
to the hospital.

24:38.552 --> 24:40.753
- Rachel Zane.
- Sorry?

24:40.770 --> 24:41.770
You have a patient here,
Rachel Zane.

24:41.805 --> 24:42.805
What room is she in?

24:42.806 --> 24:44.723
Miss Zane is resting and can--

24:44.757 --> 24:46.024
What room is she in?

24:46.059 --> 24:48.927
As I was saying,
she can't have any visitors.

24:48.945 --> 24:49.978
Look at me.

24:50.029 --> 24:52.281
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Mike.

24:52.315 --> 24:53.699
She's in 1024.

24:53.733 --> 24:54.766
You've seen her?

24:54.784 --> 24:56.402
- It's locked.
- I don't care.

24:56.436 --> 24:58.737
What are you gonna do?
You gonna break the door down?

24:58.772 --> 25:01.440
- Yeah, if I have to.
- I spoke to her doctors.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.625
They said she fainted at school.
She's fine.

25:03.660 --> 25:05.110
If she fainted,
she's not fine.

25:05.128 --> 25:07.779
They said she's run down
and a little dehydrated

25:07.797 --> 25:09.114
but that she's okay.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.416
Okay, so then--then why won't
they let us see her?

25:10.450 --> 25:12.801
Because she's sleeping,
and she needs it.

25:12.836 --> 25:14.553
Mike, she's fine.

25:14.587 --> 25:15.587
She's gonna be fine.

25:15.588 --> 25:16.748
What are you even doing here?

25:16.756 --> 25:18.006
I'm one
of her emergency contacts.

25:18.057 --> 25:19.141
They called me.

25:19.175 --> 25:20.426
Yeah, I know, but--

25:20.460 --> 25:21.626
What's a heartless shithead
like me

25:21.644 --> 25:23.645
doing in a place like this?

25:23.680 --> 25:24.963
Yeah, something like that.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.398
I would have come for you

25:26.433 --> 25:29.902
if you ever worked hard enough
to pass out, but you never did.

25:32.439 --> 25:36.024
Look, there's a steakhouse
across the street.

25:36.075 --> 25:38.527
Why don't you and I
go get something to eat?

25:38.578 --> 25:40.312
What, you gonna break
the door down and wake her up?

25:40.330 --> 25:41.830
No, I'm gonna wait
outside of it

25:41.865 --> 25:42.948
and be there when she does.

25:42.982 --> 25:43.982
Yeah, which won't happen

25:43.983 --> 25:45.200
for another eight hours,

25:45.251 --> 25:47.619
because they sedated her
to make sure she got some sleep.

25:47.653 --> 25:50.005
Come on,
let's go get some food.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.928
Don't you need to be
at an auction?

25:55.962 --> 25:57.796
Right now, I don't want
to be at that sale

25:57.830 --> 25:59.097
any more than you do.

25:59.132 --> 26:00.933
You're saying you're willing
to postpone it?

26:00.967 --> 26:03.685
I'm saying I already did.
Come on.

26:08.691 --> 26:10.609
No, I'm telling you,
Dr. Lipschitz,

26:10.643 --> 26:12.978
this is like the whole
plaque incident all over again.

26:13.012 --> 26:17.015
Yes, I have told you
about the plaque incident,

26:17.033 --> 26:18.200
at least twice.

26:18.234 --> 26:20.519
I've--no, that--
you know, it doesn't--

26:20.537 --> 26:21.703
you know what, forget it.
That's not the point.

26:21.738 --> 26:23.205
The point is,
is that I'm supposed to be

26:23.239 --> 26:24.623
leaving for the theater
in ten minutes,

26:24.657 --> 26:26.208
and I am a complete wreck.

26:26.242 --> 26:27.292
I have the worst case
of cottonmouth

26:27.327 --> 26:30.329
in the history of--

26:30.363 --> 26:32.381
what? No, you can talk
with cotton mouth.

26:32.415 --> 26:34.383
That's frickin' lockjaw.

26:34.417 --> 26:35.534
You know something, Doc?

26:35.552 --> 26:36.969
Sometimes I just think
that I've wasted

26:37.003 --> 26:38.220
every single Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday

26:38.254 --> 26:40.839
for the last 14 years.

26:45.044 --> 26:46.311
You know,
this is the first time

26:46.346 --> 26:48.013
we've ever had a steak dinner.

26:48.047 --> 26:49.681
I didn't know
you were keeping a tally.

26:49.715 --> 26:52.935
It's pretty easy to do
when the grand total is zero.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.720
I know.

26:55.738 --> 26:56.978
I said I wanted to take you out

26:56.990 --> 26:58.510
the night you told me
you were leaving.

26:58.525 --> 27:02.110
We never got around to it.

27:02.161 --> 27:05.030
I never got around to it.

27:07.667 --> 27:10.002
What's the real reason you
were at the hospital tonight?

27:10.036 --> 27:13.038
The truth?

27:13.072 --> 27:14.739
Rachel asked me
for some time off,

27:14.757 --> 27:16.508
and I all but spit in her face.

27:16.543 --> 27:18.377
So you felt guilty?

27:18.411 --> 27:19.962
Pretty much.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.746
Plus,
I knew you needed something

27:21.764 --> 27:23.181
to take your mind off her,

27:23.216 --> 27:27.603
but I can see this dinner
with me isn't working, so...

27:27.637 --> 27:29.605
Here.

27:29.639 --> 27:31.523
Holy shit.

27:31.558 --> 27:33.141
What is this?

27:33.192 --> 27:34.977
Louis is in a play.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.278
You wanted to cheer me up,

27:36.312 --> 27:37.913
and you didn't
start the night with this?

27:37.930 --> 27:39.031
Come on.

27:39.065 --> 27:40.616
I wanted to save something
for dessert.

27:40.650 --> 27:41.766
Oh, my God, that's got to be
a codpiece, right?

27:41.784 --> 27:43.285
What are you asking me for?

27:43.319 --> 27:45.639
I don't want to know if Louis
is packing that kind of heat.

27:45.655 --> 27:47.239
You think I do?

27:47.273 --> 27:48.373
You're the one
who went mudding with him.

27:48.408 --> 27:49.658
It was covered in mud.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.327
- How much mud?
- Stop.

27:52.378 --> 27:54.796
Why would I ask that?

27:54.831 --> 27:57.416
Oh, man.

27:59.302 --> 28:03.505
I shouldn't be laughing at him.

28:03.556 --> 28:07.843
He still hasn't forgiven me
for using Sheila against him.

28:09.429 --> 28:12.064
Mike, you did
what you had to do.

28:12.098 --> 28:13.599
You don't think
that was crossing a line?

28:13.633 --> 28:14.983
It was way over the line.

28:15.018 --> 28:17.069
But I got to tell you,
it was brilliant.

28:17.103 --> 28:20.238
It was harsh,
but it was brilliant.

28:23.610 --> 28:26.978
You know, Harvey,
I-I never told you.

28:26.996 --> 28:29.748
What you did with Gillis...

28:32.318 --> 28:34.920
I know you had to do it.

28:34.954 --> 28:38.423
Like I said before,
we do what we need to do.

28:42.995 --> 28:45.514
Louis, you're almost up.

28:45.548 --> 28:47.516
Oh, Christ, you're sweating
more than Nixon.

28:47.550 --> 28:48.934
I've gone through
four Elizabethan collars

28:48.968 --> 28:50.185
and a codpiece.

28:50.219 --> 28:51.186
Okay, just breathe.
You're gonna be fine.

28:51.220 --> 28:52.304
No, I can't do it.

28:52.338 --> 28:54.606
Louis, we are
in the middle of the play.

28:54.641 --> 28:56.525
You'll have to ad-lib.
Make something up.

28:56.559 --> 28:57.693
Say shylock went away.

28:57.727 --> 28:59.344
Say that he went to Israel.
Oh, my God.

28:59.362 --> 29:00.445
Wow!

29:00.480 --> 29:04.516
I don't even know what--
you know what?

29:04.534 --> 29:07.235
I never thought
you'd be so weak.

29:07.286 --> 29:08.520
Okay, why do you got to say
something hurtful right now?

29:08.538 --> 29:09.688
Oh, screw hurt!

29:09.706 --> 29:12.190
Turn that into rage.
Why would I do-

29:12.208 --> 29:15.127
You always turn hurt into
rage, you idiotic piece of shit.

29:15.161 --> 29:16.411
It is what you do.

29:16.462 --> 29:17.462
Okay, now I'm mad at you.

29:17.463 --> 29:18.697
Good!

29:18.715 --> 29:20.332
Now, imagine you're in court.
Court, how?

29:20.366 --> 29:21.533
It's too hard with the curtain.
Just do it, dipshit.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.751
Okay, fine,
I'm in court, God damn it.

29:22.802 --> 29:25.137
You happy now?
No, I'm not happy, you idiot.

29:25.171 --> 29:27.305
Now, you're in court,

29:27.340 --> 29:30.375
and you're enraged,
and you are fit to kill.

29:30.393 --> 29:33.178
Now, do you see
that audience out there?

29:33.212 --> 29:35.213
That's your jury.
They're a bunch of morons.

29:35.231 --> 29:36.431
Yeah, they're beneath you,
aren't they?

29:36.482 --> 29:37.566
- They're beneath everybody.
- What else?

29:37.600 --> 29:38.880
They're a bunch
of civil servants

29:38.884 --> 29:40.385
who can't keep up
with what I'm saying.

29:40.403 --> 29:41.903
You have absolute and total
contempt for them, don't you?

29:41.938 --> 29:44.489
I want to rip out their stupid
brains from their stupid heads.

29:44.524 --> 29:45.890
Exactly.

29:45.908 --> 29:48.727
Now, get out there
and make your case.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.985
Unless of course you're a pussy

29:49.996 --> 29:51.730
and you were meant to play
plaque your whole life.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.332
3,000 ducats.

29:58.237 --> 30:00.071
I'm gonna head back.

30:00.089 --> 30:03.875
Hey, tell Rachel she should
take the day off tomorrow.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.379
Thanks for this, Harvey.

30:07.413 --> 30:09.080
Excuse me.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.132
Which one of you is Franklin,

30:10.183 --> 30:12.551
and which one of you is Bash?

30:12.585 --> 30:14.586
Did you boys have a nice date?

30:14.604 --> 30:16.638
Couldn't be better.
He even paid.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.306
Oh, I guess
he's flush with cash

30:18.357 --> 30:19.357
ever since he left you

30:19.392 --> 30:20.759
in order to do
investment banking.

30:20.777 --> 30:21.777
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

30:21.778 --> 30:23.762
No, but I know you.
Mike Ross.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.096
Sean here is with the S.E.C.,

30:25.114 --> 30:27.115
and he's using his position
to harass my clients

30:27.150 --> 30:28.200
on behalf of Eric Woodall.

30:28.234 --> 30:29.451
Actually, not anymore, Harvey.

30:29.485 --> 30:33.822
I decided to take your advice
and focus on you.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.207
Are you following me?

30:35.241 --> 30:36.374
Oh, I've got guys who do that.

30:36.409 --> 30:37.826
Then you also better have
authorization

30:37.877 --> 30:39.411
from the Justice Department.

30:39.445 --> 30:40.879
Getting authorization
was easy,

30:40.913 --> 30:42.047
because I told them you two

30:42.081 --> 30:44.216
are on opposite sides
of a takeover battle

30:44.250 --> 30:46.835
and that your girlfriend
is your associate.

30:46.886 --> 30:48.253
Are you trying to say
that we're colluding?

30:48.287 --> 30:49.287
Oh, you went right there,
didn't you?

30:49.305 --> 30:50.505
Because you led him there.

30:50.556 --> 30:51.890
Well, in the six hours
that I've been there,

30:51.924 --> 30:53.258
this is what I've learned.

30:53.292 --> 30:56.011
Your girlfriend, who I just
mentioned works for you,

30:56.062 --> 30:58.396
faints at law school
for five minutes.

30:58.431 --> 30:59.848
You guys meet at the hospital.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.220
Then you have dinner
for two hours

31:01.234 --> 31:03.235
where you cancel
a private stock sale

31:03.269 --> 31:05.987
that you both arranged,
and one hour ago,

31:06.022 --> 31:07.856
that stock mysteriously
gets bought

31:07.907 --> 31:10.308
by some shell corporation
set up last year.

31:10.326 --> 31:11.326
- Wait, what?
- Bullshit.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.444
Here's my favorite part,

31:12.478 --> 31:13.995
where you feign outrage
and you feign ignorance

31:14.030 --> 31:16.031
to help sell the whole story.

31:19.535 --> 31:22.954
Anyway, I just wanted
to give you a little heads-up.

31:25.374 --> 31:27.509
Smile for the cameras.
Harvey.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.682
- You gave me your word.
- And I kept it.

31:33.716 --> 31:35.217
Oh, yeah,
then what about this stock?

31:35.268 --> 31:36.635
- Jessica must have done it.
- Bullshit.

31:36.669 --> 31:37.886
No, it's not bullshit.

31:37.937 --> 31:38.937
Yeah, and when were you
planning on telling me

31:38.971 --> 31:40.355
this guy was up your ass
for collusion?

31:40.389 --> 31:42.641
I didn't know about this
until five seconds ago.

31:42.675 --> 31:44.726
There are only so many things
I can buy, Harvey.

31:44.777 --> 31:47.279
Listen to me, we can deal
with this guy's bullshit later.

31:47.313 --> 31:49.948
Right now, let me deal
with the stock situation.

31:49.982 --> 31:51.702
I'll make it right.
You can't make it right.

31:51.734 --> 31:54.236
Mike, you used to trust me.

31:54.287 --> 31:57.455
I need you to trust me
right now.

32:14.632 --> 32:17.250
Rachel, wake up.

32:17.284 --> 32:20.003
Hey.
Where were you so late?

32:22.723 --> 32:25.258
I was out, thinking.

32:25.292 --> 32:26.459
Thinking what?

32:26.477 --> 32:28.795
I don't want to be a fraud.

32:28.813 --> 32:30.764
What?

32:30.798 --> 32:32.766
I love you.

32:32.800 --> 32:35.235
I'm married to her,

32:35.269 --> 32:37.070
but I don't want
to do that anymore.

32:37.104 --> 32:38.738
I want to be married to you.

32:38.773 --> 32:40.573
Logan.

32:40.608 --> 32:43.410
Rachel...

32:43.444 --> 32:45.578
Will you marry me?

32:45.613 --> 32:47.146
I can't.

32:47.164 --> 32:49.833
Why not?

32:49.867 --> 32:52.335
Because you'll always be
a fraud.

32:52.370 --> 32:54.621
How can you say that to me?

32:57.007 --> 32:58.508
Hey.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.009
You okay?

33:00.044 --> 33:01.044
Hey.

33:01.045 --> 33:05.465
Come on,
go back to sleep.

33:05.499 --> 33:08.134
I'll be here when you wake up.

33:15.342 --> 33:17.360
Who told you
to buy that stock?

33:17.395 --> 33:18.945
Excuse me?

33:18.979 --> 33:20.313
Let me start again.

33:20.347 --> 33:21.448
Hello, Jessica.

33:21.482 --> 33:23.733
I just found out
we bought the Wexler block.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.618
Would you by any chance know
how that came to happen?

33:25.653 --> 33:27.487
It came to happen
when I found out

33:27.521 --> 33:30.123
the dark pool had been canceled
and I couldn't reach you.

33:30.157 --> 33:32.859
So you took it upon yourself
to make a preemptive bid.

33:32.877 --> 33:33.910
Of course I did.

33:33.961 --> 33:35.912
If I hadn't,
Forstman would have.

33:35.963 --> 33:37.714
So why are you here?

33:37.748 --> 33:41.033
I gave Mike my word
we'd postpone the sale.

33:41.051 --> 33:42.869
Well, I didn't give
Mike anything.

33:42.887 --> 33:44.220
Do you even want to know why?

33:44.255 --> 33:45.371
Not particularly.

33:45.389 --> 33:47.173
It was because Rachel
passed out at school

33:47.207 --> 33:48.508
and was in the hospital.

33:48.542 --> 33:49.809
Is she all right?

33:49.844 --> 33:50.844
Do you care?

33:50.845 --> 33:51.845
Don't you make me out

33:51.846 --> 33:53.167
to be the villain in this,
Harvey.

33:53.180 --> 33:56.483
I am sorry Rachel fainted,

33:56.517 --> 33:58.067
but our obligation
is to our client,

33:58.102 --> 34:00.770
and I'm not undoing that sale.

34:00.821 --> 34:01.988
We can't tonight anyway.

34:02.022 --> 34:03.389
Why not?

34:03.407 --> 34:05.057
Because Cahill
came out of nowhere.

34:05.075 --> 34:06.443
He's been
having me followed.

34:06.494 --> 34:08.911
He thinks Mike and I
are colluding on Gillis,

34:08.946 --> 34:11.114
and if we undo that sale,
it'll just fuel the fire.

34:11.165 --> 34:13.199
I told you
I was still worried about him.

34:13.233 --> 34:14.417
What did you want me to do?

34:14.452 --> 34:16.753
Have myself tailed
to pick up a possible tail?

34:16.786 --> 34:20.239
What did you come in here
to tell me, Harvey?

34:20.257 --> 34:22.208
Now that Sean Cahill
is involved,

34:22.242 --> 34:24.844
we also can't ever transfer
those shares to Logan.

34:24.879 --> 34:27.764
Which conveniently helps
fix your deal with Mike Ross.

34:27.797 --> 34:29.047
- Jessica--
- You know what?

34:29.081 --> 34:30.516
Doesn't matter.
We don't need to transfer them.

34:30.551 --> 34:32.802
We'll just vote Logan's way
when the time comes.

34:32.853 --> 34:36.422
Jessica,
I gave Mike my word.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.975
Harvey, I don't care
if you took a blood oath.

34:39.025 --> 34:43.279
Our duty is to our client,
not a handshake with Mike Ross.

34:43.313 --> 34:45.398
And this discussion is over.

34:53.290 --> 34:54.574
Checked you out.

34:54.608 --> 34:56.876
You're free to go
on your own recognizance.

34:56.911 --> 34:58.127
How much was bail?

34:58.162 --> 35:01.247
Oh, it's okay,
I took care of it.

35:01.281 --> 35:02.799
How are you feeling?

35:02.833 --> 35:04.217
You know,
I'm actually feeling--

35:04.251 --> 35:05.251
I'm feeling pretty good.

35:05.252 --> 35:06.532
In fact,
I think that I'm going--

35:06.554 --> 35:09.055
Rachel, no,
you can't do any work today.

35:09.089 --> 35:10.924
I'm just gonna
stop by the office

35:10.958 --> 35:14.060
and put away just three files,
send four emails.

35:14.094 --> 35:15.311
That's it.

35:15.346 --> 35:20.099
I have to do this
just for my own peace of mind.

35:23.237 --> 35:26.239
- No more.
- No more.

35:26.273 --> 35:29.325
I won't even tell anybody
that I'm there.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.311
I won't.

35:32.329 --> 35:33.809
Louis, can I talk to you
for a minute?

35:33.814 --> 35:34.914
Of course.

35:34.949 --> 35:38.001
First of all,
you were remarkable last night.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.487
- Who said?
- Everyone in the cast.

35:41.505 --> 35:42.789
The <i>Flushing Chronicle?</i>

35:42.823 --> 35:44.824
Um, you know, I don't
actually read the local--

35:44.842 --> 35:47.627
You should, because they said
I was a shock to the senses.

35:47.661 --> 35:48.795
I bought six copies
this morning.

35:48.829 --> 35:50.046
I'm gonna send five to Esther,

35:50.097 --> 35:52.015
because she thinks
she's such a great singer.

35:52.049 --> 35:53.049
Okay.

35:53.050 --> 35:54.500
Louis, what I came in here
to say--

35:54.518 --> 35:55.685
Donna, I'm retiring.

35:55.719 --> 35:59.138
You're what?

35:59.172 --> 36:01.474
You helped me
get over a fear

36:01.508 --> 36:03.643
that I never thought
I'd get over.

36:03.677 --> 36:06.195
But I don't want to see
the audience as the jury.

36:06.230 --> 36:09.382
I don't want to have disdain
for them.

36:09.416 --> 36:13.353
I am the audience,

36:13.387 --> 36:16.422
and I want to love them.

36:16.457 --> 36:19.158
- Louis.
- Donna, I'm sorry.

36:19.192 --> 36:20.627
Because I know I'm taking away

36:20.661 --> 36:22.028
your last glorious night
from you,

36:22.046 --> 36:25.415
but I can't go on again.

36:25.466 --> 36:27.467
I, um...

36:29.837 --> 36:30.837
I can't do it.

36:30.838 --> 36:32.305
It's okay, Louis.

36:32.339 --> 36:33.423
It's okay.

36:33.474 --> 36:36.042
It turns out
that the other shylock

36:36.060 --> 36:39.211
only sprained his ankle.

36:39.229 --> 36:43.716
Looks like he's gonna be able
to go on tonight after all.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.385
Wait a minute.

36:46.403 --> 36:48.938
He never hurt his ankle at all,
did he?

36:52.860 --> 36:54.181
You know,
I just knew that you had

36:54.194 --> 36:58.665
a lot of things going on lately
with Harvey and Malone,

36:58.699 --> 37:01.451
and sometimes the best way
to deal with disappointment

37:01.502 --> 37:04.871
in one arena
is to accomplish something else.

37:06.590 --> 37:07.740
Thank you.

37:07.758 --> 37:11.577
You're welcome, Louis.

37:11.595 --> 37:15.965
Hey, remember when you said
that you're not a lawyer?

37:19.019 --> 37:21.104
You could be.

38:12.573 --> 38:14.857
Got Donna's message.
What's going on?

38:14.908 --> 38:18.161
How's Rachel?

38:18.195 --> 38:20.697
She's good.
Resting.

38:22.282 --> 38:25.334
- Mike.
- God damn it, I knew it.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.703
I knew you wouldn't fix it.

38:26.754 --> 38:28.871
- I tried.
- You tried?

38:28.922 --> 38:30.173
You're a name partner.

38:30.207 --> 38:32.375
And she's the managing
partner, and you know it.

38:32.426 --> 38:33.376
That wouldn't have
made a difference

38:33.427 --> 38:34.627
if you were fighting for you.

38:34.661 --> 38:37.463
I fought Jessica for you
and won more than once,

38:37.497 --> 38:40.600
but this isn't
one of those times, Mike.

38:40.634 --> 38:42.135
Believe me,
this isn't what I wanted.

38:42.169 --> 38:45.722
My mistake was believing you
when you gave me your word.

38:48.025 --> 38:50.193
No.

38:50.227 --> 38:53.062
I made the mistake
by not believing in you

38:53.113 --> 38:57.150
the second you brought me
your takeover plan.

38:57.184 --> 39:02.071
Look, I don't have
a lot of regrets.

39:02.122 --> 39:03.355
It's just not who I am.

39:03.373 --> 39:07.744
But this is one of them.

39:07.795 --> 39:10.496
If I could go back
and change it, I would,

39:10.530 --> 39:14.217
but I can't.

39:16.053 --> 39:19.005
Is that supposed to stop me?

39:20.841 --> 39:23.760
No, I just wanted you
to know it.

39:23.811 --> 39:26.679
Do what you have to do.

39:46.900 --> 39:50.536
Mr. Ross,
what can I help you with?

39:52.172 --> 39:53.405
Actually, nothing.

39:53.423 --> 39:55.208
Nothing?

39:55.242 --> 39:56.259
What do you mean nothing?

39:56.293 --> 39:59.128
I mean I made a mistake.

39:59.179 --> 40:02.098
I'm gonna find another way
to win this thing.

40:02.132 --> 40:06.919
I'm grateful, but I'm not gonna
need your money anymore.

40:06.937 --> 40:11.274
You may not need my money,
but you've got it.

40:12.526 --> 40:14.894
What are you talking about?

40:14.928 --> 40:18.597
You think I didn't know
what you were up to?

40:18.615 --> 40:21.267
You tried
not to fund the money,

40:21.285 --> 40:23.045
so you could leverage Specter
out of the deal

40:23.070 --> 40:24.637
and get out of our deal.

40:24.671 --> 40:26.105
- How...
- Did I know?

40:26.123 --> 40:30.442
I've done the same thing
a hundred times.

40:30.460 --> 40:31.878
I'm actually glad you did it,

40:31.912 --> 40:35.748
because now I know the kind
of person I'm in bed with.

40:37.784 --> 40:40.253
A sneaky little shit like me.

40:43.724 --> 40:46.225
Yeah, do you know the difference
between you and me?

40:46.260 --> 40:47.527
I'm not taking the money

40:47.561 --> 40:50.096
because I don't want
to screw over my partner.

40:50.130 --> 40:53.232
And if I were you,

40:53.267 --> 40:56.319
I wouldn't want
to screw him over either.

40:56.353 --> 40:58.104
That man has nothing
but wonderful things

40:58.138 --> 41:01.073
to say about you.

41:01.108 --> 41:03.609
You had him take the money,
didn't you?

41:03.643 --> 41:06.946
He couldn't believe
it hadn't happened already.

41:06.980 --> 41:11.483
He told me he's having a little
tombstone made up for you.

41:11.501 --> 41:15.371
Mike, we are partners on this,

41:15.422 --> 41:18.124
whether you like it or not.

41:36.026 --> 41:37.026
What are you doing here?

41:37.027 --> 41:39.178
I'm here to deliver these.

41:39.196 --> 41:40.196
Who are those for?

41:40.197 --> 41:44.200
Who do you think they're for?

41:44.234 --> 41:45.651
For you,
for your dressing room.

41:45.685 --> 41:48.187
Let's go.

41:48.205 --> 41:49.488
You're coming?

41:49.522 --> 41:51.290
You think I'm gonna miss
your closing night?

41:51.325 --> 41:52.959
I didn't know
you were a Shakespeare fan.

41:52.993 --> 41:55.962
I'm a Donna fan.

41:57.414 --> 41:59.165
You know, Harvey,
you don't have to do this.

41:59.199 --> 42:00.416
I know you got a lot
going on with Mike.

42:00.467 --> 42:03.252
The only thing I got going on
tonight is you.
