00:20.209 --> 00:22.617
Here, baby. Come on, baby.

00:23.796 --> 00:25.789
Good girl.

01:21.144 --> 01:23.718
<i>Ancient one of the earth so deep</i>

01:23.897 --> 01:26.388
<i>Master of moon and sun</i>

01:26.859 --> 01:29.812
<i>I shield you in my Wiccan way</i>

01:29.986 --> 01:32.607
<i>Here in my circle round</i>

01:32.947 --> 01:35.783
<i>Asking you protect this space</i>

01:35.951 --> 01:38.952
<i>And offer your sun- force down</i>

01:47.879 --> 01:49.208
What are you doing here?

02:15.865 --> 02:19.697
- Prue?
- In here, working on the chandelier.

02:24.165 --> 02:26.834
- Sorry I'm late.
- What else is new?

02:27.001 --> 02:29.623
Piper, I would have been here
to meet the electrician myself,

02:29.838 --> 02:32.625
but I can't leave the museum until 6.
I haven't even had time to change.

02:32.965 --> 02:36.417
I just, I didn't realise how long I was
in Chinatown. Did Jeremy call?

02:36.594 --> 02:39.263
No, but he had some roses
and a package delivered.

02:39.430 --> 02:42.135
What were you doing in Chinatown?
I thought you had an interview?

02:42.350 --> 02:44.805
I did, but I went to Young Lee Market
after my interview

02:44.978 --> 02:47.765
to get the ingredients for my
audition recipe tomorrow.

02:47.939 --> 02:50.228
So that Wolfgang Puck knockoff
didn't hire you today?

02:50.400 --> 02:53.982
No, but this just may get me the job.

02:54.153 --> 02:55.777
Jeremy sent you port?

02:55.946 --> 02:57.856
It's the ultimate ingredient
for my recipe.

02:58.032 --> 02:59.941
Nice boyfriend.

03:00.576 --> 03:02.865
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

03:03.037 --> 03:05.823
Tell me that's not
our old spirit board.

03:05.998 --> 03:08.868
I found it in the basement when I
was looking for the circuit tester.

03:09.043 --> 03:10.786
"To my three beautiful girls.

03:11.003 --> 03:13.162
May this give you the light
to find the shadows.

03:13.380 --> 03:16.085
The power of three will set you free.
Love, Mom."

03:16.258 --> 03:18.796
We never did figure out
what this inscription meant.

03:19.011 --> 03:22.760
Send it to Phoebe. That girl is so in the
dark, maybe a little bit of light will help.

03:22.973 --> 03:24.633
You're always so hard on her.

03:24.808 --> 03:27.644
Piper, the girl has no vision.
No sense of the future.

03:27.937 --> 03:30.475
I really think
Phoebe's coming around.

03:30.648 --> 03:33.221
As long as she doesn't come
around here, I guess it's good news.

05:17.586 --> 05:19.129
Okay.

05:22.883 --> 05:24.674
Okay, okay.
We have three units on it now.

05:24.843 --> 05:27.251
- Well, it's about time.
- I got here as soon as I heard.

05:27.763 --> 05:30.088
Another dead female, right?
Mid- To late 20s?

05:30.307 --> 05:33.427
I've been paging you for over an hour,
Trudeau. Where have you been?

05:33.644 --> 05:35.019
Oakland, checking out a lead.

05:35.187 --> 05:36.516
What lead?

05:36.689 --> 05:39.180
- One that didn't go anywhere.
- You're avoiding my question.

05:39.358 --> 05:42.893
Because you don't want to know
I went to an occult shop.

05:43.863 --> 05:46.864
You hate me, don't you?
You wanna see me suffer.

05:47.033 --> 05:48.776
I want to solve these murders.

05:48.993 --> 05:51.910
- Someone's after witches.
- Women.

05:52.079 --> 05:55.115
That woman up there, I'll bet
she was killed with an athame.

05:55.290 --> 05:57.414
Wrong. Double-edged steel knife.

05:57.584 --> 05:59.791
Right. That's an athame.

05:59.962 --> 06:02.796
It's a ceremonial tool.
Witches use them to direct energy.

06:03.423 --> 06:05.048
That woman didn't direct jack.

06:05.217 --> 06:08.420
She was stabbed. Plain and simple.

06:09.513 --> 06:11.719
Was she found near an altar?

06:11.890 --> 06:13.218
Yes.

06:13.392 --> 06:15.929
Were there carvings on that altar?

06:18.689 --> 06:20.432
Just do me a favour.

06:20.607 --> 06:24.901
Don't ever follow a lead
without checking with me first.

06:25.278 --> 06:26.821
You want to go to occult shops?

06:29.992 --> 06:31.651
Just get to work, okay?

06:32.994 --> 06:35.071
Inspector Trudeau.

06:35.371 --> 06:37.661
<i>Jeremy Burns,
San Francisco Chronicle.</i>

06:37.833 --> 06:40.241
- You care to comment?
- A woman was stabbed.

06:40.418 --> 06:42.246
Plain and simple.

06:42.755 --> 06:45.292
That's the third one in three weeks.

07:02.023 --> 07:04.063
I don't get it.
I have checked everything.

07:04.234 --> 07:06.855
There's no reason why the chandelier
should not be working.

07:07.028 --> 07:09.353
We've been talking about what
to do with that spare room.

07:09.531 --> 07:11.819
I think you're right.
We do need a roommate.

07:11.991 --> 07:14.317
Well, we could rent out
the room at a reduced rate

07:14.494 --> 07:16.153
in exchange for help
around the house.

07:16.329 --> 07:17.954
Phoebe's good with a wrench.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.950
Phoebe lives in New York.

07:20.709 --> 07:21.953
Not anymore.

07:23.461 --> 07:25.039
What?

07:25.547 --> 07:27.919
She left New York.
She's moving back in with us.

07:31.093 --> 07:32.837
You've got to be kidding.

07:33.012 --> 07:35.420
Well, I could hardly say no.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.763
It's her house too.
It was willed to all of us.

07:37.934 --> 07:40.555
Yeah, months ago and we haven't
seen or spoken to her since!

07:40.729 --> 07:43.398
- Well, you haven't spoken to her.
- No, I haven't.

07:43.605 --> 07:45.266
Maybe you've forgotten
why I'm so mad.

07:45.441 --> 07:47.564
No, of course not,
but she had nowhere else to go.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.478
She lost her job. She's in debt.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.272
And this is news?

07:51.447 --> 07:52.941
How long have you known
about this?

07:53.157 --> 07:54.817
A couple of days.

07:54.992 --> 07:57.317
Maybe a week. Or two.

07:58.079 --> 08:00.831
Thanks for sharing.
When does she arrive?

08:01.874 --> 08:03.333
Surprise!

08:06.754 --> 08:09.161
I found the hide-a-key.

08:09.673 --> 08:11.582
Phoebe, welcome home.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.754
- Hello, Piper.
- It's so good to see you.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.716
- Isn't it, Prue?
- I'm speechless.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.017
- Oops. I forgot about the cab.
- I'll get it.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.095
Piper, that's my purse!

08:28.192 --> 08:30.730
Thanks. I'll pay it back.

08:31.695 --> 08:33.438
Is that all that you brought?

08:33.614 --> 08:35.772
That's all that I own.
That and a bike.

08:38.535 --> 08:40.279
Look, I know that you don't
want me here.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.912
We're not selling Gram's house.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.581
Is that why you think I came back?

08:43.749 --> 08:46.323
The only reason Piper and I gave up
our apartment and moved back

08:46.502 --> 08:49.336
was because this house has been
in our family for generations.

08:49.546 --> 08:51.705
No history lesson needed,
I grew up here too.

08:52.007 --> 08:54.214
So can we talk about what's
really bothering you?

08:54.384 --> 08:56.342
No, I'm still furious with you.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.214
So you'd rather have a tense reunion

08:58.388 --> 09:00.926
filled with boring chitchat
and unimportant small talk?

09:01.099 --> 09:03.472
No, but otherwise we won't
have anything to talk about.

09:03.894 --> 09:06.646
- I never touched Roger.
- Whoa.

09:06.855 --> 09:09.772
I know you think otherwise because
that's what that Armani-wearing,

09:09.983 --> 09:12.474
chardonnay-slugging
trust-funder told you, but...

09:12.652 --> 09:13.981
Hey!

09:14.529 --> 09:18.942
I have a great idea! Why don't I
make a fabulous reunion dinner?

09:19.117 --> 09:21.157
I'm not hungry.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.154
I ate on the bus.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.832
Okay, we'll try the group hug later.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.288
<i>I'm at an apartment building
on the corner of 8th and Franklin</i>

09:30.462 --> 09:32.750
<i>where a murder occurred
earlier this evening.</i>

09:32.922 --> 09:35.164
<i>The victim, believed to be a nurse
at County General,</i>

09:35.341 --> 09:38.295
<i>was reportedly stabbed to death
in her apartment.</i>

09:38.470 --> 09:41.424
- It's me.
- Come on in.

09:43.308 --> 09:47.092
- Oh, thank God. I am starving!
- I figured.

09:47.270 --> 09:50.105
Hey, that's my boyfriend, Jeremy!

09:50.481 --> 09:52.889
- What happened?
- Oh, some woman got whacked.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.605
"Whacked"? Phoebe, you've been
in New York way too long.

09:56.321 --> 09:58.194
Yeah. I should have stayed.

09:59.115 --> 10:01.950
Why didn't you tell Prue
I was coming back?

10:02.160 --> 10:03.784
And risk her changing the locks?

10:03.953 --> 10:06.527
Besides, you should have been
the one to tell her, not me.

10:06.789 --> 10:08.663
Good point, Chicken Little.

10:08.833 --> 10:12.664
It's just so hard for me to talk to her.
She's always been more like a mother.

10:12.837 --> 10:15.162
That's not her fault.
She practically had to sacrifice

10:15.381 --> 10:18.298
- her own childhood to raise us.
- Her own childhood to raise us.

10:18.509 --> 10:19.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:22.013 --> 10:23.970
Hey, we're lucky she
was so responsible.

10:24.348 --> 10:27.053
You and I had it easy.
All we had to do was be there.

10:27.268 --> 10:30.055
Yeah, well, I don't need a mom
anymore, you know, I need a sister.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.768
Hey.

10:33.941 --> 10:35.898
This was always the coldest room
in the house.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.020
Thanks.

10:47.288 --> 10:49.411
The same tattoo was on
the other two victims.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.155
So the murderer is killing cultists.

10:52.335 --> 10:53.912
No, the murderer is on a witch-hunt.

10:54.086 --> 10:57.123
Oh, yeah, and he's 500 years old
and he lives in Salem.

10:57.298 --> 11:01.876
Look around, Trudeau.
Pentagrams, altars, offerings.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.843
All tools for a freak fest.

11:04.054 --> 11:07.258
They call them sabbats,
and this was hardly a freak fest.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.597
She was a solitary practitioner.
She practised her craft alone.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.845
Let me ask you something.
Do you believe in UFOs?

11:15.483 --> 11:17.392
- Hell, no.
- Neither do I.

11:17.568 --> 11:20.485
But do you believe there are people
out there who do believe in UFOs?

11:20.696 --> 11:23.187
Yes, but I think they're crazy.

11:23.406 --> 11:27.618
Then why can't you believe there are
people who believe they are witches?

11:27.953 --> 11:32.033
Look, all I know is that if you don't
stop talking about witches,

11:32.457 --> 11:34.249
I'm gonna start questioning you.

11:41.049 --> 11:43.089
I'd stay away from that cat, Trudeau.

11:43.260 --> 11:46.296
It's been clawing the crap
out of everybody.

11:46.471 --> 11:48.511
See you at the car.

11:59.693 --> 12:02.148
I'm glad to hear you and Jeremy
are still together.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.063
Where did you meet him anyway?

12:04.239 --> 12:08.319
We met at the hospital cafeteria
the day Grams was admitted.

12:08.493 --> 12:11.826
He was covering a story
and I was bawling over a bagel.

12:11.996 --> 12:14.238
So he handed me a napkin.

12:14.415 --> 12:17.085
- How romantic.
- As a matter of fact, it was.

12:17.252 --> 12:20.455
The napkin had his
phone number on it.

12:21.381 --> 12:23.457
- Stop pushing the pointer.
- I'm not touching it.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.959
You used to always
push the pointer.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.009
More popcorn?

12:28.680 --> 12:30.008
Hey, I forgot your question.

12:30.181 --> 12:33.930
I asked if Prue would have sex with
someone other than herself this year.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.810
That's disgusting!

12:36.104 --> 12:38.773
Please say yes.

12:42.735 --> 12:44.229
Piper.

12:45.571 --> 12:48.241
- Piper, get in here!
- What?

12:48.616 --> 12:51.534
- What did you guys do now?
- Me? I didn't do anything.

12:51.703 --> 12:54.075
The pointer on the spirit board.
It moved on its own.

12:55.915 --> 12:58.121
I'm serious. It spelled A-T.

12:58.584 --> 13:00.043
- Well, did you push it?
- No!

13:00.211 --> 13:01.918
You always used to push the pointer.

13:02.087 --> 13:05.124
My fingers were
barely touching it. Look.

13:11.222 --> 13:13.795
It did it again! It moved!

13:16.310 --> 13:19.228
- It's still on the letter T.
- I swear, it moved.

13:23.442 --> 13:24.984
There! Look!

13:25.903 --> 13:28.655
- You saw that, right?
- I think so, yeah.

13:28.864 --> 13:30.738
I told you I wasn't touching it.

13:32.451 --> 13:34.776
Prue, can you come in here a sec?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.831
- Now what?
- I think it's trying to tell us something.

13:41.418 --> 13:42.533
Attic.

13:47.716 --> 13:50.551
Don't you think you're overreacting?
We are perfectly safe here.

13:50.719 --> 13:54.053
Don't say that. In horror movies, the
person who says that is the next to die.

13:54.223 --> 13:57.425
It's pouring rain. There's a psycho's on
the loose. Jeremy's not even home.

13:57.601 --> 14:01.017
So, I'll... I'll wait in the cab till
he gets home from work.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.679
- That'll be cheap.
- Prue, I saw that pointer move.

14:03.899 --> 14:07.599
No, look, what you saw was
Phoebe's fingers pushing the pointer.

14:07.777 --> 14:10.102
There's nothing in that attic.
She's playing a joke on us.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.320
We don't know that.
We've lived here for months now

14:12.491 --> 14:15.741
and we've never been able
to get that attic door open.

14:15.952 --> 14:18.443
- Great, now the phone doesn't work.
- Yeah, the power's out.

14:18.622 --> 14:20.495
- Just go with me to the basement.
- What?

14:20.707 --> 14:22.699
I need you to hold the flashlight.

14:23.126 --> 14:24.918
Phoebe will go with you
to the basement.

14:25.087 --> 14:28.455
- No, I'm going to the attic.
- No, you're not. We already agreed.

14:28.673 --> 14:31.129
I am not waiting for some handyman
to check out the attic

14:31.343 --> 14:34.510
and I'm certainly not waiting until
tomorrow. I'm going now.

14:38.099 --> 14:39.973
Prue, wait!

16:15.863 --> 16:18.698
<i>"Book of Shadows.</i>

16:23.829 --> 16:25.786
<i>Hear now the words of the witches</i>

16:25.998 --> 16:28.619
<i>The secrets we hid in the night</i>

16:28.793 --> 16:31.462

<i>We want the power</i>

<i>Give us the power"</i>

17:10.834 --> 17:12.957
What are you doing?

17:13.377 --> 17:16.332
Reading an incantation.

17:16.506 --> 17:18.084
<i>It was in this Book of Shadows.</i>

17:18.258 --> 17:20.415
- I found it in that trunk.
- Let me see that.

17:20.593 --> 17:23.594
- How did you get in here?
- The door opened.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.090
Wait a minute.

17:25.263 --> 17:27.720
An incantation?
What kind of incantation?

17:27.892 --> 17:30.977
It said something about there
being three essentials of magic:

17:31.146 --> 17:34.063
Timing, feeling
and the phases of the moon.

17:34.232 --> 17:36.355
If we were ever gonna do this,

17:36.526 --> 17:40.903
now, midnight on a full moon,
is the most powerful time.

17:41.072 --> 17:43.528
"This"? Do what, "this"?

17:43.700 --> 17:45.158
Receive our powers.

17:45.326 --> 17:48.945
What powers? Wait, our powers?
You included me in this?

17:49.122 --> 17:50.699
No, she included all of us.

17:50.873 --> 17:52.616
<i>"Bring your powers to we sisters three"</i>

17:52.792 --> 17:55.828
- It's a book of witchcraft.
- Let me see that.

18:03.010 --> 18:04.920
Spirit boards. Books of witchcraft.

18:05.095 --> 18:07.503
It figures all this freaky stuff
started when you arrived.

18:07.681 --> 18:09.509
I wasn't the one that
found the spirit board.

18:09.684 --> 18:11.842
It wasn't my fingers sliding
around on the pointer.

18:12.020 --> 18:14.392
It doesn't matter, because
nothing happened, right, Phoebe?

18:14.564 --> 18:16.473
When you did the incantation?

18:16.649 --> 18:19.935
Well, my head spun around
and I vomited split pea soup.

18:20.111 --> 18:21.735
How should I know?

18:21.904 --> 18:23.612
Well, everything looks the same.

18:23.781 --> 18:25.987
- You're right.
- Yep, the house still needs work.

18:26.158 --> 18:30.950
And everything feels the same,
so nothing's changed, right?

19:00.650 --> 19:02.062
You're up early.

19:02.236 --> 19:04.109
I never went to sleep.

19:04.279 --> 19:06.153
Don't tell me you put on
a black conical hat

19:06.323 --> 19:09.407
and spent the night flying around
the neighbourhood on a broomstick?

19:10.327 --> 19:13.743
The only broom I've ever had was
kept in a closet beside a mop.

19:13.914 --> 19:16.202
So what were you doing?

19:16.541 --> 19:17.917
Reading. Is Prue around?

19:18.085 --> 19:20.836
She went to work early.
Reading aloud?

19:21.546 --> 19:23.255
No.

19:23.715 --> 19:25.210
<i>But according to
the Book of Shadows,</i>

19:25.384 --> 19:30.211
one of our ancestors was a witch
named Melinda Warren.

19:30.972 --> 19:33.298
And we have a cousin who's a drunk,
and aunt who's manic,

19:33.474 --> 19:35.764
and a father who's invisible.

19:35.935 --> 19:38.687
I'm serious. She practised powers.
Three powers.

19:38.855 --> 19:42.805
She could move objects with her mind,
see the future, and stop time.

19:42.985 --> 19:45.191
Before Melinda was burned
at the stake,

19:45.362 --> 19:47.935
she vowed that each generation
of Warren witches

19:48.115 --> 19:50.522
would become
stronger and stronger,

19:50.701 --> 19:54.116
culminating in the arrival
of three sisters.

19:54.788 --> 19:58.204
These sisters would be the most
powerful witches the world has known.

19:58.417 --> 20:01.749
They're good witches
and I think we're those sisters.

20:01.919 --> 20:05.965
Look, I know what happened last
night was weird and unexplainable,

20:06.133 --> 20:09.133
but we are not witches,
and we do not have special powers.

20:09.343 --> 20:12.795
Besides, Grams wasn't a witch and
as far as we know, neither was Mom.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.680
So take that, Nancy Drew.

20:17.518 --> 20:19.511
We're the protectors of the innocent.

20:19.729 --> 20:21.768
We're known as the Charmed Ones!

20:26.861 --> 20:28.983
There's been a change of plans.

20:29.196 --> 20:31.687
A change of plans?
Regarding the Beals exhibition?

20:31.866 --> 20:34.404
The extra money that you helped raise
through private donations

20:34.577 --> 20:37.246
has sparked significant
corporate interest.

20:37.413 --> 20:41.542
The Beals artefacts will now become
part of our permanent collection.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.247
Well, that's terrific.

20:44.461 --> 20:47.249
Which is why the board wants
someone a little more qualified

20:47.423 --> 20:49.878
to handle the collection
from now on.

20:50.050 --> 20:51.710
You look surprised.

20:51.885 --> 20:53.879
I don't know why, I'm furious.

20:54.097 --> 20:56.422
Not only have I been on this project
since its inception,

20:56.599 --> 21:00.549
but I'm the curator who secured
the entire exhibition.

21:02.229 --> 21:04.306
You're the person more qualified,
aren't you?

21:04.481 --> 21:07.103
I could hardly say no to the entire
board of directors, could I?

21:07.276 --> 21:09.103
But I know you'll be happy for me.

21:09.278 --> 21:12.694
After all, what's good for me
is definitely good for you.

21:13.908 --> 21:16.577
- Right, Miss Halliwell?
- "Miss Halliwell"?

21:16.744 --> 21:19.235
Since when did we stop being
on a first-name basis?

21:19.455 --> 21:21.329
When we stopped sleeping together?

21:21.499 --> 21:23.787
Or when I returned your
engagement ring, Roger?

21:23.959 --> 21:26.830
I didn't realise the two
were mutually exclusive.

21:27.004 --> 21:29.673
Although I certainly enjoyed
one more than the other.

21:30.424 --> 21:31.835
Bastard.

21:33.510 --> 21:35.550
Prue, wait.

21:36.221 --> 21:40.266
I feel like I should say something,
if only to avoid a lawsuit.

22:11.089 --> 22:15.252
Your time is up.

22:16.344 --> 22:17.719
Let's see.

22:17.887 --> 22:20.259
Roast pork with gratin,
Florence fennel

22:20.431 --> 22:23.551
and penne with a port giblet sauce.

22:23.768 --> 22:25.179
- Chef Moore?
- What?

22:25.353 --> 22:26.682
The port.

22:26.855 --> 22:30.105
Yes. Without it, the sauce is nothing
more than a salty marinara.

22:30.274 --> 22:32.848
A recipe from a woman's magazine.

22:33.403 --> 22:35.276
I didn't have time for...

22:38.449 --> 22:39.944
But...

22:44.831 --> 22:46.241
Chef Moore?

22:46.791 --> 22:48.700
Chef Moore?

22:50.420 --> 22:52.128
Hello?

22:53.506 --> 22:55.250
Hello?

23:15.653 --> 23:18.061
That is very good.

23:18.238 --> 23:19.567
<i>C'est magnifique.</i>

23:22.410 --> 23:26.110
It was my idea to spark corporate
interest from private donations.

23:26.288 --> 23:31.709
Besides, not only have I been
with this project since its inception,

23:31.877 --> 23:36.623
but we both know who really
secured the entire exhibit.

23:36.966 --> 23:39.042
- Prue.
- I quit.

23:40.428 --> 23:43.001
I'm going to have to call you back.

23:44.181 --> 23:45.724
Think about this, Prue.

23:45.892 --> 23:49.011
Lousy job, lousy pay, lousy boss.
What's to think about?

23:49.228 --> 23:51.897
Your future. Because, believe me,
if you walk out with no notice,

23:52.064 --> 23:54.471
- you can kiss any references...
- Don't threaten me, Roger.

23:58.904 --> 24:01.146
You know me. Had to try.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.484
You're hurt. You're angry.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.735
Your pride is wounded.
I understand all that.

24:06.286 --> 24:08.824
That's why you can't see
that I'm doing you a favour.

24:09.414 --> 24:12.285
- Excuse me?
- I had to take the exhibit away.

24:12.501 --> 24:16.250
If I hadn't, the board would've come in
and put a total stranger in my place.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.256
Think about it, Prue.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.915
I'm here for you, not some stranger.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.418
You should be thanking me,
not leaving me.

24:23.637 --> 24:25.048
Well, I'm not worried.

24:25.222 --> 24:28.840
I'm certain your intellect will make
quick work of the 75 computer discs

24:29.059 --> 24:31.680
and the thousands of pages of
research I've left in my office.

24:31.853 --> 24:33.846
- You're gonna regret this.
- I don't think so.

24:34.063 --> 24:36.899
I thought breaking up with you
was the best thing I had ever done,

24:37.067 --> 24:38.775
but this definitely tops that.

24:40.445 --> 24:42.319
Goodbye, Roger.

24:43.490 --> 24:46.989
I hope there are no office supplies
in your purse!

25:01.924 --> 25:03.503
What the hell was that?

25:05.595 --> 25:08.003
Phoebe, answer the phone.

25:08.181 --> 25:10.423
Answer the phone.

25:17.941 --> 25:19.648
Oh, God, Jeremy, you scared me.

25:19.817 --> 25:21.193
I can see. I'm sorry.

25:21.361 --> 25:22.736
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:22.904 --> 25:26.949
Now I am. I really am.
What are you doing here?

25:27.116 --> 25:29.868
I wanted to be the first one to
congratulate you on your new job.

25:30.244 --> 25:32.367
You're always surprising me.
How did you know?

25:32.538 --> 25:33.867
You prepared your specialty.

25:34.082 --> 25:38.708
And anyone who's ever sampled your
work can see how talented you are.

25:38.920 --> 25:41.327
I get so turned on when
you talk about food.

25:41.506 --> 25:43.213
Hot dogs.

25:43.675 --> 25:46.462
Hamburgers. Pizza.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.245
No, wait!

26:46.779 --> 26:49.151
Hi, I'm looking for my sister,
Phoebe Halliwell.

26:49.323 --> 26:51.030
One second, please.
What's the name again?

26:51.450 --> 26:53.988
Inspector Andrew Trudeau, Homicide.

26:54.203 --> 26:56.242
Dr Gordon's expecting me.

26:57.706 --> 26:59.284
Andy?

26:59.917 --> 27:02.490
Prue? I don't believe it.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.671
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

27:05.880 --> 27:10.210
I'm fine. I just can't believe
I'm running into you.

27:10.386 --> 27:13.055
Yeah. I'm picking up Phoebe.
She had some sort of an accident.

27:13.263 --> 27:15.754
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Oh, yeah. She'll be fine.

27:16.057 --> 27:17.967
What are you doing here?

27:19.269 --> 27:21.427
Murder investigation.

27:22.189 --> 27:25.059
Your sister's still in X-ray,
so it'll be another 15 minutes.

27:25.234 --> 27:27.392
Dr Gordon's office is to the left
and down the hall.

27:27.569 --> 27:29.894
He's with a patient right now,
but you're free to wait.

27:30.447 --> 27:32.855
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:33.616 --> 27:35.408
Well...

27:37.078 --> 27:39.284
It's good seeing you, Prue.

27:39.664 --> 27:42.499
Yeah, you, too, Andy.
Take care.

27:45.378 --> 27:49.078
You know, Phoebe's busy
and Dr Gordon's busy.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.254
Can I buy you a bad cup of coffee
while we wait?

27:53.594 --> 27:55.172
Sure.

27:56.889 --> 27:59.131
So you're an inspector now?

27:59.308 --> 28:02.760
What can I say? In any other city,
I'd be called a "detective."

28:02.937 --> 28:04.645
"Inspector" is classier.

28:05.398 --> 28:06.975
I'm liking it better already.

28:07.734 --> 28:09.477
Your dad must be so proud.

28:09.652 --> 28:12.143
Third generation,
you bet he's happy.

28:12.321 --> 28:14.563
How about you?
You taking the world by storm?

28:14.740 --> 28:17.148
Well, I'm living
back at Gram's house

28:17.326 --> 28:20.114
and as of an hour ago,
I'm looking for work.

28:20.747 --> 28:23.452
- I heard you moved to Portland.
- I'm back.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.242
You still seeing Roger?

28:26.794 --> 28:29.166
- How did you know about him?
- I know people.

28:30.381 --> 28:32.457
You checked up on me?

28:33.259 --> 28:36.260
I wouldn't call it that.

28:37.388 --> 28:38.633
What would you call it?

28:40.266 --> 28:41.925
Inquiring minds want to know.

28:42.142 --> 28:45.476
- You checked up on me.
- What can I say? I'm a detective.

28:45.688 --> 28:48.523
<i>Miss Halliwell, please meet
your sister at the nurse's station.</i>

28:51.319 --> 28:53.988
The Chosen Ones? Charmed Ones?
Phoebe, this is insane.

28:54.155 --> 28:56.859
Are you telling me that nothing
strange happened to you today?

28:57.032 --> 29:00.033
You didn't freeze time
or move anything?

29:00.202 --> 29:03.322
Roger took an exhibit away from me.

29:03.706 --> 29:06.742
All right, look, Phoebe, I know that you
think that you can see the future,

29:06.917 --> 29:09.622
- which is pretty ironic...
- Since you don't think I have one?

29:09.836 --> 29:15.626
That my vision of life is cloudy
compared to your perfect hell?

29:16.051 --> 29:20.215
Even if you don't want to believe me,
just once, can't you trust me?

29:20.430 --> 29:23.182
Phoebe, I do not have
special powers.

29:23.392 --> 29:25.717
Now, where is the cream?

29:30.065 --> 29:32.817
Really? That looks
pretty special to me.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.862
Oh, my God.
So I can move things with my mind?

29:45.080 --> 29:48.745
With how much you hold inside,
you should be a lethal weapon by now.

29:49.752 --> 29:53.334
- I don't believe it.
- This means Piper can freeze time.

29:56.258 --> 29:58.831
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

29:59.052 --> 30:03.429
- You've turned me into a witch.
- You were born one, we all were.

30:03.598 --> 30:05.970
And I think we better start
learning to deal with that.

30:09.646 --> 30:11.473
<i>When I was looking through
the Book of Shadows</i>

30:11.648 --> 30:14.815
I saw these carvings. They looked like
something out of a Bosch painting.

30:14.985 --> 30:17.819
All these terrifying images
of three women

30:17.987 --> 30:20.609
battling different incarnations of evil.

30:20.823 --> 30:22.366
Evil fighting evil, that's a twist.

30:22.534 --> 30:25.238
Actually, a witch can be
either good or evil.

30:25.411 --> 30:29.575
A good witch follows a Wiccan Rede:
"An it harm none, do what ye will."

30:29.791 --> 30:33.041
A bad witch, or a warlock,
has but one goal,

30:33.211 --> 30:36.247
to kill good witches
and obtain their powers.

30:36.422 --> 30:38.581
Unfortunately, they look
like regular people.

30:38.758 --> 30:41.545
They could be anyone, anywhere.

30:41.719 --> 30:43.379
And this has what
to do with us?

30:43.554 --> 30:46.425
Well, in the first woodcarving
they were in a slumber,

30:46.599 --> 30:49.968
but in the second one, they were
battling some kind of warlock.

30:50.145 --> 30:54.356
I think as long as we were in the dark
about our powers, we were safe.

30:54.524 --> 30:56.516
Not anymore.

31:01.739 --> 31:05.783
Has anything weird or unexplainable
ever happened to you?

31:06.327 --> 31:09.328
Sure. It's called luck or fate.

31:09.497 --> 31:11.573
Some call it miracles.

31:11.749 --> 31:13.741
Why? What happened?

31:13.918 --> 31:18.247
Forget it. Even if I could tell you,
you'd swear I was crazy.

31:18.630 --> 31:20.956
Open your fortune cookie.

31:22.677 --> 31:24.835
Okay.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.594
"Soon you will be on top."

31:31.351 --> 31:33.012
It doesn't say that.

31:33.187 --> 31:35.263
- Yes, it does.
- Let me see.

31:35.439 --> 31:36.767
Is that a bad thing?

31:36.941 --> 31:40.985
"Of the world.
Soon you will be on top of the world."

31:41.153 --> 31:43.525
- Can you make a left on 7th?
- You got it.

31:43.697 --> 31:45.985
Seventh? I thought we were
going to your place.

31:46.199 --> 31:47.860
We are, but you reminded me
of something.

31:48.035 --> 31:49.944
I want to show you
the old Bowing Building.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.745
The view of the Bay Bridge?

31:51.914 --> 31:53.705
It's amazing.

31:55.084 --> 31:57.575
- I'll be right back with your prescription.
- Take your time.

31:57.753 --> 31:59.829
Excuse me, where do you
keep the aspirin?

32:00.047 --> 32:01.956
- Aisle three.
- Thank you.

32:02.132 --> 32:04.374
Chamomile tea works great
for headaches.

32:04.551 --> 32:06.010
Not for this one, it won't.

32:06.177 --> 32:08.135
You know, I'm not afraid
of our powers.

32:08.305 --> 32:11.141
I mean, everyone inherits something
from their family, right?

32:11.307 --> 32:13.798
Yeah, money, antiques,
a strong disposition.

32:13.977 --> 32:15.637
That's what normal people inherit.

32:15.813 --> 32:17.639
Who wants to be normal
when we can be special?

32:17.814 --> 32:19.688
I want to be normal.
I want my life to be...

32:19.858 --> 32:21.601
You know, isn't this aisle three?

32:21.776 --> 32:24.943
Well, we can't change what happened.
We can't undo our destiny.

32:25.113 --> 32:27.402
- Do you see any aspirin?
- I see chamomile tea.

32:27.574 --> 32:30.195
Look, I have just found out
that I'm a witch,

32:30.369 --> 32:31.696
that my sisters are witches,

32:31.911 --> 32:35.826
and that we have powers that will
apparently unleash all forms of evil.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.868
Evil that is going to
come looking for us.

32:38.043 --> 32:39.418
So, excuse me, Phoebe,

32:39.586 --> 32:42.207
but I am not exactly in a
homeopathic mood right now.

32:42.380 --> 32:45.584
Then move your headache
out of your mind.

32:52.599 --> 32:55.303
You move things when you're upset.

32:55.810 --> 32:59.180
This is ridiculous. I thought that you
landed on your arm, not your head.

32:59.355 --> 33:02.974
- You don't believe me?
- Of course I don't believe you!

33:03.234 --> 33:04.859
Roger.

33:07.321 --> 33:09.610
Now, let's talk about Dad
and see what happens.

33:09.782 --> 33:11.940
- He's dead, Phoebe.
- No, he's moved from New York,

33:12.118 --> 33:13.612
but he's very much alive.

33:13.787 --> 33:15.162
He isn't to me.

33:15.329 --> 33:16.954
He died the day he left Mom.

33:17.164 --> 33:20.534
What are you talking about? He's
always been a button-pusher for you!

33:20.752 --> 33:23.587
You're mad he's alive,
you're mad I tried to find him,

33:23.797 --> 33:25.955
and you're mad I came back.

33:26.132 --> 33:28.884
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad.

33:36.893 --> 33:39.598
- Feel better?
- Lots.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.060
<i>The Book of Shadows said that
our powers would grow.</i>

33:42.773 --> 33:44.766
Grow to what?

33:50.865 --> 33:53.901
Well, here we are.

33:54.076 --> 33:56.402
I don't care how amazing
the view is, I'm not going in.

33:56.621 --> 33:59.741
Come on, I have a surprise inside.

34:11.761 --> 34:13.219
You are gonna love this.

34:13.387 --> 34:16.755
I bet you tell Phoebe and Prue
the moment you see them.

34:17.475 --> 34:20.013
I never mentioned
Phoebe came home.

34:20.185 --> 34:22.639
- Oops.
- What is that?

34:23.021 --> 34:24.350
It's your surprise.

34:24.774 --> 34:26.433
Jeremy, stop it.
You're scaring me.

34:27.443 --> 34:29.649
- Damn it, I'm serious!
- So am I!

34:29.862 --> 34:32.187
See, I've waited six months for this.

34:32.364 --> 34:35.780
Ever since Grams
went into the hospital.

34:35.951 --> 34:39.034
See, I've known for quite some time
that the moment the old witch croaked

34:39.204 --> 34:41.327
that all your powers,
they'd be released.

34:41.540 --> 34:42.949
Powers that would
reveal themselves

34:43.123 --> 34:45.449
as soon as the three of you
got together again.

34:46.253 --> 34:48.329
All that was needed was
for Phoebe to return.

34:48.755 --> 34:50.831
It's you, isn't it?
You killed all those women.

34:51.049 --> 34:53.005
Not women, witches.

34:53.342 --> 34:55.135
Why?

34:56.096 --> 34:57.840
It was the only way
to get their powers.

34:59.224 --> 35:01.513
And now I want yours.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.235
Okay, think, stay calm.

35:17.868 --> 35:20.156
Think, think, think.
Gotta get out of here.

35:20.329 --> 35:23.364
Okay, okay.

35:45.061 --> 35:46.519
<i>Prue, it's Roger.</i>

35:46.687 --> 35:48.727
<i>I've decided to let you
come back to work.</i>

35:48.898 --> 35:50.523
<i>Seriously, let's talk.</i>

35:50.692 --> 35:54.191
Well, Piper's definitely not home,
unless she's turned into a cat.

35:54.362 --> 35:55.904
- How'd the cat get in?
- I don't know.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.447
Someone left a window open.

35:57.615 --> 36:00.735
- Did Piper leave a message?
- She's probably out with Jeremy.

36:00.910 --> 36:03.697
- Roger called.
- Yeah, I heard.

36:04.038 --> 36:06.196
- Prue!
- In here.

36:08.084 --> 36:10.242
- Piper?
- My God. What is it? What's wrong?

36:10.420 --> 36:12.708
Lock the doors! Check the windows!
We don't have time!

36:12.880 --> 36:15.039
<i>Phoebe, in the Book, did it say
how to get rid of a...</i>

36:15.425 --> 36:17.963
- Warlock?
- Oh, my God.

36:31.481 --> 36:34.055
I'll get you, you bitch.

36:41.492 --> 36:43.983
- I'm calling the cops.
- And tell them that we're witches?

36:44.161 --> 36:47.115
That some freak with powers beyond
comprehension is trying to kill us?

36:47.289 --> 36:50.741
Even if the cops did come, they'd be
no match for Jeremy and we'd be next.

36:50.918 --> 36:54.286
I've found the answer.
It's our only hope. Come on!

36:55.464 --> 36:57.338
Okay, we've placed the nine candles

36:57.508 --> 36:59.749
anointed with the oils
and spices in a circle.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.671
Wait, I only count eight.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.010
- You forgot this one.
- A birthday candle?

37:04.223 --> 37:06.631
I guess Grams was a little low
on witch supplies.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.433
All right, next, we need the poppet.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.304
- Got it.
- I think we're set.

37:10.687 --> 37:12.229
We're ready to cast the spell.

37:12.439 --> 37:15.357
Okay, first, I'll make it stronger.

37:16.277 --> 37:19.977
<i>Your love will wither and depart
From my life and my heart</i>

37:20.155 --> 37:23.358
<i>Let me be, Jeremy
And go away forever</i>

37:28.121 --> 37:31.288
- Okay, the spell is complete.
- Let's hope it works.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.816
Wait, it didn't work.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.117
- What?
- The spell. It didn't work.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.194
- How do you know?
- When I touched the pot, I had a flash.

38:11.373 --> 38:14.493
- I saw Jeremy.
- You touched the pot and saw him?

38:14.709 --> 38:16.453
He's on his way here.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.098
Hello, ladies.

38:30.307 --> 38:32.016
Piper, Phoebe...

38:32.935 --> 38:35.307
...get out of here. Now!

38:36.189 --> 38:37.813
Cool parlour trick, bitch.

38:38.023 --> 38:41.025
Yeah, you were always the tough one,
weren't you, Prue?

38:47.200 --> 38:49.192
Phoebe, you're right.
Our powers, they're growing.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.242
Put as many things against
the door as you can!

38:51.412 --> 38:55.031
You can't keep me out, Prue.
My powers are stronger than yours.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.580
- Okay.
- Yeah, look out.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.960
You don't think a chair will stop me.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.463
You don't think a dresser
can stop me.

39:09.513 --> 39:11.885
Have you witches figured it out?

39:12.892 --> 39:16.936
Nothing, nothing can keep me away.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.270
What do we do?
We're trapped!

39:25.112 --> 39:27.650
Come on, we'll face him together!
Remember the spirit board?

39:27.823 --> 39:29.566
The inscription on the back!

39:29.783 --> 39:31.610
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

39:39.418 --> 39:40.912
Come on, we've got to stay together.

39:41.336 --> 39:43.708
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

39:43.922 --> 39:45.714
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

39:45.883 --> 39:47.674
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

39:48.386 --> 39:50.378
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

39:50.554 --> 39:52.463
<i>The power of three will set us free</i>

39:52.639 --> 39:54.383
I'm not the only one!

39:54.933 --> 39:56.676
I'm one of millions.

39:56.893 --> 40:01.306
In places you can't even imagine,
in forms you would never believe.

40:01.481 --> 40:03.059
We are hell on this earth!

40:03.359 --> 40:09.859
You'll never be safe
and you'll never be free!

40:18.207 --> 40:20.365
The power of three.

40:32.637 --> 40:34.131
Good morning.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.760
Hey.

40:37.934 --> 40:40.140
This is a surprise.

40:40.604 --> 40:43.889
I've been feeling really guilty
about that bad cup of coffee.

40:44.065 --> 40:45.809
I just wanna make it up to you.

40:45.984 --> 40:47.561
So you brought me
a good cup of coffee?

40:47.735 --> 40:49.562
Oh, this? No, this is mine.

40:51.406 --> 40:53.862
I just wanted to ask you
out to dinner.

40:55.702 --> 40:57.160
Unless, of course, you're afraid.

40:57.787 --> 40:59.411
Afraid of what?

40:59.580 --> 41:01.205
Oh, you know.
Having too good a time,

41:01.374 --> 41:05.288
stirring up old memories,
rekindling the old flame.

41:05.461 --> 41:06.955
Good point. Better not.

41:07.547 --> 41:09.207
Okay.

41:10.007 --> 41:11.881
Friday night, 8:00?

41:13.428 --> 41:15.254
You hesitated.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.802
Yeah, but it's not what you think.

41:19.100 --> 41:21.722
It's just that my life has gotten
a bit complicated.

41:24.105 --> 41:27.022
- Can I call you?
- Sure.

41:31.946 --> 41:33.773
Take care, Prue.

41:34.282 --> 41:36.025
Bye, Andy.

41:36.743 --> 41:39.826
- That was Andy.
- I told you I heard a man's voice.

41:39.995 --> 41:42.119
What did he want?

41:42.623 --> 41:44.118
He asked me out.

41:44.292 --> 41:45.702
And you said?

41:45.876 --> 41:49.826
Well, I started to say yes
and then I stopped.

41:50.381 --> 41:53.584
I wondered if I could date.
I mean, do witches date?

41:54.051 --> 41:57.467
Not only do they date,
but they usually get the best guys.

42:06.647 --> 42:08.889
You two will not be laughing
when this happens to you.

42:09.066 --> 42:10.975
Believe me, everything
will be different now.

42:11.151 --> 42:13.025
Well, at least our lives
won't be boring.

42:13.195 --> 42:14.606
But they'll never be the same.

42:14.780 --> 42:16.358
And this is a bad thing?

42:16.532 --> 42:18.820
No, but it could be a big problem.

42:18.992 --> 42:20.700
Prue's right.
What are we gonna do?

42:20.869 --> 42:22.245
What can't we do?

42:22.413 --> 42:24.536
We're going to be careful.
We're going to be wise.

42:24.707 --> 42:26.165
And we're gonna stick together.

42:26.333 --> 42:28.789
This should be interesting.
