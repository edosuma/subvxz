00:40.498 --> 00:41.833
[ROARS]

00:46.546 --> 00:50.049
[VENDEL] You have unlocked
the might of the Triumbric Stones.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.637
This proves you're ready
to begin the next level of training,

00:54.721 --> 00:57.932
mastering the powers
of our rarest elements.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.185
Say the incantation.

01:00.935 --> 01:04.730
- For the Glory of Merlin, Daylight...
- No, the other one.

01:05.315 --> 01:09.319
For the Doom of Gunmar,
Eclipse is mine to command.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.160
Marvelous. The legend made real.

01:18.661 --> 01:22.290
Merlin's Amulet
is a relic of unfathomable power.

01:22.373 --> 01:25.084
It is said, when he forged it,
he made it malleable

01:25.168 --> 01:27.754
so each Trollhunter
may combat darkness

01:27.837 --> 01:31.424
that even its creator could not foresee.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.011
So, new stones, new power.
What else can it do?

01:35.595 --> 01:36.471
Blinkous.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.266
Your "periodic table" is amusing.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.603
Uncovering but a few elements.

01:43.686 --> 01:48.733
But in truth, there are more
than you can ever imagine.

01:51.736 --> 01:55.448
We have, in our possession,
a few remaining stones

01:55.532 --> 01:59.077
that Trollhunters past have used
to unlock their potential.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.415
Stones that will grant swiftness,
a glimpse into your enemy's mind,

02:04.499 --> 02:06.960
even the power to walk in daylight.

02:07.043 --> 02:08.877
Um, l think I'm good with that one.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.132
Shalll we see how good you are
with the rest?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.431
[GRUNTS] All right...

02:20.515 --> 02:24.018
This stone was used
by Araknak the Agile.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.522
There was no obstacle
he could not traverse.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.399
Just make sure you keep your focus.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.733
[CHUCKLES]

02:30.817 --> 02:32.861
- What? What'd you say, Blink?
- [GRUNTS]

02:32.944 --> 02:34.112
[JIM GRUNTS]

02:34.195 --> 02:36.739
Hmm. Perhaps another?

02:37.574 --> 02:39.450
The Aspectus Stone.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.579
Legends of old claim
it granted Maddrux the Many

02:42.662 --> 02:44.914
the power to summon the strength
of a thousand.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.499
Come on, super strength.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.167
I'm ready.

02:48.251 --> 02:49.377
[GRUNTING]

02:49.460 --> 02:53.464
- Use your legs, Master Jim.
- Little help? Little help?

02:53.548 --> 02:54.591
- [THUDS]
- Ooh. Ow.

02:56.217 --> 03:02.056
Perhaps our young Trollhunter is not
ready for the power of the gemstones.

03:02.140 --> 03:07.103
We shall revisit this another day,
when he is less... distracted.

03:07.186 --> 03:10.940
[GRUNTS] Yeah, I think I just
pulled my everything.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.736
- [GROANS]
- Hey, Jim. How was training?

03:14.819 --> 03:18.239
Oh, you know. Stone, magic, troll...

03:18.323 --> 03:21.910
[CLEARS THROAT] You wouldn't by chance
wanna come to my parents' barbacoa?

03:21.993 --> 03:23.995
Barbecue? Like, hot dogs? Sure.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.497
My mom throws this thing
with the teachers union

03:26.581 --> 03:28.416
to drum up support for her re-election.

03:28.499 --> 03:31.044
[SIGHS] It's such a drag.
It's cool if you don't wanna.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.504
NotEnrique will be gone.
It'll just be me there.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.048
- But...
- I said I'd love to.

03:35.131 --> 03:38.593
You'll do it? Thank you so much!
It starts at noon.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.887
I'll tell them you're coming.
Don't be late.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.432
Aw, snap, Jimbo.
You know what this means?

03:44.515 --> 03:46.267
You're officially meeting the parents.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.686
- You're being vetted.
- Vetted?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.689
Answer me this,
has she ever called you her boyfriend?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.608
Uh, not that I can remember.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.735
Because her parents hate you.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.779
- Remember?
- I try to forget.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.448
You have a second chance
to make a first impression.

04:00.531 --> 04:03.785
- If you win her parents over...
- I can be her boyfriend.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.536
Think of it this way, screw this up,

04:05.620 --> 04:08.706
and her parents will never let you
see her again.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.712
- [GRUNTING]
- [GASPING]

04:15.505 --> 04:17.966
Holy schnikies! What was that?

04:18.048 --> 04:21.302
I don't know. The Amulet's been
on the fritz all morning.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.680
Take it off. It's glowing again.

04:25.556 --> 04:28.810
You better put that bad boy away.
Well, I gotta train.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.438
- Catch you on the flip side.
- [CHUCKLES]

04:32.522 --> 04:34.816
[GRUNTING]

04:34.899 --> 04:39.320
- Oh, hey, Draal.
- Ah. The mighty Trollhunter.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.532
[GRUNTS]

04:46.744 --> 04:50.039
- You again?
- Excuse me, exquisite trolls.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.249
Back already?

04:51.332 --> 04:57.422
Have you seen the fair Claire?
I cannot live in a world without her.

04:57.505 --> 04:59.215
- She just left.
- Ha-ha!

04:59.299 --> 05:04.804
Then I will let my heart guide me
until I win her parents' favor.

05:04.887 --> 05:10.101
Because nothing,
nothing is more important than love.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.686
Ahh!

05:11.769 --> 05:12.770
[SIGHS]

05:12.854 --> 05:16.232
I used to feel like that... once.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.067
Um...

05:20.611 --> 05:25.992
All must be perfect.
Skulls. We need more skulls.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.870
- [CLANKING]
- Our Underlord is here.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.005
This way, mein Kaiser.

05:39.088 --> 05:43.051
For centuries,
we have prepared for your return.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.013
We've even crafted
an exact replica of your throne.

05:47.096 --> 05:49.265
Here, sit, sit.

05:49.348 --> 05:51.684
We've sat long enough!

05:51.768 --> 05:54.979
But my hunger... [SNIFFS]

05:55.855 --> 05:58.941
This place only smells of Impures.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.277
Where is flesh to eat?

06:01.360 --> 06:06.741
Underlord, I have procured a taste
of something very special

06:06.824 --> 06:10.244
that should rejuvenate you.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.747
Living Heartstone. [MURMURS]

06:14.248 --> 06:16.584
What? How did you acquire it?

06:16.667 --> 06:21.297
Enjoy, mein Kaiser.
You will need your strength.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.551
[SHUDDERS, EXCLAIMS]

06:28.137 --> 06:32.517
I need more. A taste is not enough.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.311
Of course.
The Heartstone itself is within reach.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.146
We shall march on Trollmarket at once.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.901
We should not be so hasty, lest
we suffer the same as your reckless son.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.320
You dare speak ill of Bular?

06:44.403 --> 06:46.781
Bular was impulsive.

06:46.864 --> 06:52.078
Why risk taking Trollmarket
when it could be handed to you?

06:52.161 --> 06:54.539
I would not listen to the Impure.

06:54.622 --> 06:59.502
Silence! You have my attention, counsel.

06:59.585 --> 07:04.132
Tell me how Trollmarket will fall.

07:06.384 --> 07:10.263
[LAUGHS] Well, if you ask me, there are
three kinds of people in this town.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.182
Those who are good at math
and those who aren't.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.475
[ALL LAUGH]

07:16.436 --> 07:18.771
Mom says you have to
make these soy dogs.

07:18.855 --> 07:23.484
[SIGHS] Those things...
aren't touching my grill.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.570
Not everyone likes chorizo, Papi.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.280
Everyone likes chorizo.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.073
Why don't I smell soy dogs sizzling?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.242
There are guests with allergies
we have to please.

07:31.325 --> 07:34.287
- Remember, every vote counts.
- [SIGHS]

07:37.915 --> 07:39.750
- [SQUEAKS]
- [SIGHS]

07:39.834 --> 07:42.545
So, Darling, where is that boy of yours?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.756
First, Mother, he's not my boy.
And he should be here any minute.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.843
I hope he's bringing a check
for the damage he did to our house.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.971
Come on,
you know he's really sorry about that.

07:52.054 --> 07:56.058
There he is. He certainly looks like
he's winning over the guests.

07:56.142 --> 08:00.438
Lady Janeth,
I don't know what's more exquisite.

08:00.521 --> 08:03.566
Is it your marvelous intellect?

08:08.154 --> 08:14.952
Or is it those beautiful celestial
spheres orbiting around a radiant star?

08:15.036 --> 08:16.704
[GASPS] Oh!

08:16.787 --> 08:19.540
I do use a leave-in conditioner.

08:19.624 --> 08:23.336
- Jim, you made it. Thank you.
- [GASPS] Claire, my darling.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.339
Your mere presence takes my breath away.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.049
[CHUCKLES] Very funny.

08:28.132 --> 08:31.135
[GASPS SOFTLY] Our love is no joke.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.095
- Um...
- Hello, James.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.097
Good to see you again,
under better circumstances.

08:36.682 --> 08:42.270
What better circumstances than to
support a pillar of the community?

08:42.813 --> 08:46.317
Councilwoman NuÃ±ez, if I may say so,

08:46.400 --> 08:51.405
you are the beating heart
of our fair town.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.618
My, my, my. This one might
have a future in politics.

08:55.701 --> 08:58.204
[HUMMING]

09:01.290 --> 09:04.293
I don't know what's more exquisite.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.588
Is it your marvelous intellect?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.969
[GASPS] Oh, no. No, no. Oh, no.

09:13.052 --> 09:16.305
[SCREAMS] No! Oh, no!

09:16.389 --> 09:18.683
[JIM SHOUTS] No!

09:18.766 --> 09:21.185
- [PHONE RINGS]
- Hello?

09:21.269 --> 09:23.646
[JIM] It's crazy.
There's another me at the barbecue,

09:23.729 --> 09:26.023
and there's weird juju.
I'm freaking out, man.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.443
- For you.
- Master Jim, how are you?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.904
- There's two of me.
- I'm not quite following.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.283
I'm telling you, Blink,
there is another me at the party.

09:35.366 --> 09:37.076
Another Master Jim?

09:37.159 --> 09:38.619
- [BOTH LAUGH]
- Good crackles.

09:38.703 --> 09:42.915
You're certain he's an exact duplicate?
Humans do all look alike.

09:42.999 --> 09:48.796
I mean, he looks like me,
but are my legs really that skinny?

09:48.879 --> 09:51.173
Why hasn't anyone told me
my legs are that skinny?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.259
Well, the Glamour Mask is accounted for,

09:53.342 --> 09:55.886
and you've no secret siblings
as far as we know.

09:55.970 --> 09:59.932
Wait. Jim, this morning did you remove
the Aspectus Stone from your Amulet?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.810
[SIGHS] No, I guess I forgot.
Let me just...

10:05.688 --> 10:07.315
Aah!

10:07.398 --> 10:08.774
Ow. It won't come out.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.777
The stone must still be active
with your double in play.

10:11.861 --> 10:15.948
Hmm. I'm starting to suspect Maddrux
the Many did not use it to grant him

10:16.032 --> 10:19.535
the strength of a thousand,
but to summon one thousand of him.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.039
A thousand me's?
Two me's are bad enough.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.333
We gotta stop this, Blink.
How do I get rid of him?

10:25.416 --> 10:28.002
The legend is murky.
This will take time to research.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.587
[JIM 2] But of course.

10:29.670 --> 10:34.508
I would cherish a personal tour
of the NuÃ±ez manor.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.177
Lead the way.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.888
- I gotta go.
- Ah, ah...

10:40.681 --> 10:42.975
Amulet, I am the Trollhunter.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.602
Fix this right now.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.729
[SHOUTS, GROANS]

10:46.812 --> 10:48.439
Not again.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.400
Trollhunter answers every call.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.987
What? Are you serious?
I don't need another me.

10:55.071 --> 11:00.201
Or am I exactly what you need?
I'm the best shot you got, boy.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.078
- [MRS. NUÃEZ] That's a bidet.
- Get down!

11:02.161 --> 11:07.500
- And this is Claire's bedroom.
- Ah. This room never ceases to amaze me.

11:08.334 --> 11:12.838
What a weird thing to say,
since you've never been in here before.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.758
Maybe we should get back to the party.
Every vote counts.

11:15.841 --> 11:21.305
- Every vote does indeed count.
- Whoa. That was a close one. Thanks.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.808
This is a huge liability.

11:23.891 --> 11:26.811
Your need to impress Claire has
summoned that monstrosity.

11:26.894 --> 11:31.440
Now we have "love-drunk Jim" threatening
to expose troll magics to the world.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.403
- Wait. So, you don't like him, either?
- [SIGHS] Let me break it down for you.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.698
A Trollhunter's greatest mission
is to protect our secret.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.825
So no, "skinny legs."

11:40.908 --> 11:44.870
I can contain the threat, you keep the
civilians distracted. Can you handle that?

11:44.954 --> 11:48.958
- But how are you gonna get rid of him?
- I don't know, better give me the Amulet.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.421
- Hang on. How can I trust you?
- Because I am you, big head.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.256
At least, the Trollhunting part of you.

11:55.798 --> 11:59.051
There's no better soldier
for the mission. [CHUCKLES]

11:59.135 --> 12:03.139
And you're absolutely not gonna ruin
the barbecue and my life?

12:03.222 --> 12:06.684
[GROANS] I've no interest
in human affairs.

12:06.767 --> 12:09.103
Uh, I don't know.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.020
Glory!

12:10.729 --> 12:11.981
[SHOUTS]

12:16.610 --> 12:17.987
Glory!

12:19.613 --> 12:22.950
Whoa. I never knew I could look so cool.

12:24.326 --> 12:27.538
S-O-Y. Soy.

12:27.621 --> 12:31.208
Why, I've never tasted anything better.

12:31.792 --> 12:32.626
[GROANS]

12:34.253 --> 12:36.297
But is that chorizo I smell?

12:36.380 --> 12:40.384
Because let me be clear,
that is way better than soy.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.261
- [CHUCKLES] Duh.
- Ah.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.764
I see you have come to your senses.
[CHUCKLES] Come here, smart boy.

12:45.848 --> 12:50.936
You, you brute.
You cannot bind the human spirit.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.606
What crimes have I committed
but from yearnings of the heart?

12:53.689 --> 12:57.526
Unsanctioned use of troll magic,
hindering a Trollhunter in his duties

12:57.610 --> 12:59.987
and altogether wussiness.

13:00.070 --> 13:05.034
You will be detained until we determine
how to get rid of you.

13:05.117 --> 13:09.455
Rid of me? But, are we not brothers,
cut from the same cloth?

13:09.538 --> 13:12.541
Oh, I am nothing like you.

13:12.625 --> 13:18.839
But I am part of Jim too.
His love of Claire created me.

13:18.923 --> 13:23.135
Just look how much he needs her.

13:23.719 --> 13:27.473
You're right, he's lost focus.
No wonder he needs me.

13:27.556 --> 13:33.103
If he wants to get rid of me,
what do you think he'll do to you?

13:33.187 --> 13:34.021
Huh. Hmm.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.775
Cut me free. We can help each other.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.528
Looks like my mission has changed.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.446
Let's talk, Romeo.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.035
Whoops.
That wasn't supposed to happen.

13:50.579 --> 13:51.830
[CLAIRE] Sure nothing's wrong?

13:51.914 --> 13:55.042
You've been acting super weird.
Maybe this was a bad idea.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.919
No, it was just my nerves.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.129
- But I'm okay now, I promise.
- [DOOR OPENS]

14:00.548 --> 14:02.424
Would you excuse me for a moment?

14:06.720 --> 14:08.347
Hey, how'd it go?

14:12.309 --> 14:15.354
He's gone. Yeah.
I returned him to the Amulet.

14:15.437 --> 14:19.525
Really? Great. How'd you do it?
Hopefully it wasn't too painful.

14:19.608 --> 14:23.737
- Sorry, but my work's far from done.
- No, you're definitely done.

14:23.821 --> 14:28.200
- I say so. I'm the Trollhunter.
- Hardly. You created this mess,

14:28.284 --> 14:32.538
distracted by your ridiculous infatuation
with Claire. You have forgotten your duty.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.666
You don't deserve
the sacred responsibility of the Amulet.

14:35.749 --> 14:36.876
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:36.959 --> 14:41.881
Sorry you feel that way.
But hate to break it, you work for me.

14:41.964 --> 14:44.508
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.
I'm taking command.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.886
Don't worry,
this won't hurt, Troll-weenie.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.345
Oh, no, no, no!

14:48.429 --> 14:50.848
I am the Hunter now.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.058
Are you freaking kidding me?

14:54.602 --> 14:56.270
- Claire, I can explain.
- I can explain.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.188
One of you, what is going on?

14:58.272 --> 14:59.273
Claire, I can...

14:59.356 --> 15:02.902
Claire, let me say this, short and sweet,
I've decided I cannot see you anymore.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.821
Our relationship is interfering
with my duty as...

15:05.905 --> 15:08.908
- This is the worst day of my life!
- That's the real Jim.

15:08.991 --> 15:13.203
Claire, I'm so sorry. I never meant
for this to happen, especially not here.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.624
The Amulet, it's malfunctioning
and creating other me's.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.334
Or parts of me, I guess.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.461
Which part is he? The jerk part?

15:20.544 --> 15:23.422
- [DOOR OPENS]
- [GROANS] He keeps doing that.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.634
Come on. We gotta find him
before he ruins the party.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.553
...always laughing and trying to...

15:29.637 --> 15:35.184
Oh... Send me back? I am the hero
Trollmarket and Arcadia needs.

15:35.267 --> 15:39.563
If I'm gonna sever all ties,
I'll need a strategic diversion.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.442
Those fools can't stop me
if they can't find me. [CHUCKLES]

15:48.781 --> 15:50.699
- [BEGINS TO SNEEZE]
- Got ya, you little...

15:50.783 --> 15:51.742
[SCREAMS]

15:51.825 --> 15:55.913
Please don't hurt me. Everything's
so scary out here. Strangers.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.832
Pollution in the air.
Bears in the woods.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.418
Oh, boy. You are not Hunter Jim.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.547
He made more? Of course he did.
Why'd I'd have to be so clever?

16:05.631 --> 16:07.007
Okay, you call for backup.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.843
And keep an eye on Scaredy Jim
while I search for the others.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.596
No, no. I'm afraid to be all by myself.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.974
[SHOUTING]

16:18.268 --> 16:20.437
- What up?
- Blood magic?

16:20.521 --> 16:22.314
- Shh.
- [PHONE RINGS]

16:22.398 --> 16:23.399
Ah, Master Jim.

16:23.482 --> 16:27.194
[JIM] Blinky! The other Jim clones,
it's out of control. Now, they're all...

16:27.277 --> 16:30.239
- Yes, yes, we were expecting this call.
- You were?

16:30.322 --> 16:34.868
The real Jim already reached out to us
and explained a clone might call.

16:34.952 --> 16:39.790
We had strict instructions to ignore
anything he, or rather, you, may say.

16:39.873 --> 16:43.585
- No, wait! I'm the real Jim.
- Of course you are.

16:43.669 --> 16:46.672
Now get back in that Amulet,
you dirty doppelganger.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.173
[ALL LAUGH]

16:48.257 --> 16:49.591
Pound it.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.970
- And we're on our own.
- [SHRIEKS]

16:54.263 --> 16:59.101
- [SIGHS]
- Yo, yo, yo! Holla! This party is crispy.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.271
- [DANCE MUSIC PLAYS]
- Ra!

17:02.354 --> 17:04.940
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

17:07.108 --> 17:12.614
Coach, hey. I've decided I'm your new
captain of the wrestling team.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.827
- Tryouts aren't till spring, kid.
- No prob. I'll do it now.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.954
- Ra! Backbreaker.
- [CHOKING] Get off of me!

17:20.039 --> 17:22.540
Scorpion lock. [YELLS]

17:22.624 --> 17:26.002
- Get off of me! That move's not legal!
- Oh, yeah.

17:26.086 --> 17:31.175
- Time to tag out, Jim.
- Holla! Crispy, yeah!

17:33.635 --> 17:37.014
- In the doghouse already?
- Please don't hurt me.

17:37.097 --> 17:42.561
[SOBS] They... They overcharged you
on your cable bill?

17:42.644 --> 17:47.107
This world is so cruel.
I can't believe it.

17:47.191 --> 17:51.278
There, there.
He just cares a lot about utilities.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.781
- I can't believe it....
- Ay-yi-yi.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.324
[JIM 3] Hmm.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.660
[MUSIC POUNDS OUTSIDE]

17:58.744 --> 18:01.330
- Music's too loud. I don't want guacamole.
- [CAT SCREECHES]

18:01.413 --> 18:02.748
How about we leave, then?

18:02.831 --> 18:05.000
- I don't wanna get up.
- Too bad.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.461
Hey, guys, I'm back. I forgot me...

18:07.544 --> 18:10.589
- Booyah! In your face.
- You can't use jokers.

18:10.672 --> 18:13.592
- [SOBS] It's so unfair.
- Shut up.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.804
Hola, Enrique. Â¿CÃ³mo estÃ¡s? Â¿QuÃ© tal?

18:18.138 --> 18:19.139
[DOG BARKS]

18:19.223 --> 18:22.559
Uh, I'm not dealing with this.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.019
- [CAT SCREECHES]
- [CLATTERING]

18:24.103 --> 18:25.229
Oh, ow!

18:25.312 --> 18:28.732
- My back hurts.
- I'm starting to get sick of myself.

18:28.816 --> 18:33.195
Pardon, bonita. Â¿DÃ³nde
estÃ¡ la zapaterÃ­a?

18:33.278 --> 18:36.115
You're telling me...
Wait, where's Hunter Jim?

18:36.198 --> 18:39.201
Arcadia Teachers Union,
thank you so very much

18:39.284 --> 18:40.619
for joining me today.

18:40.702 --> 18:45.791
With your votes, I can lead Arcadia
to a brighter and safer tomorrow.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.876
You want to be safe?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.711
I'm sorry, what was that?

18:49.795 --> 18:55.050
You have no idea what's out there. You'll
need real leadership. A real hero.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.427
Someone who won't waste time
with distractions,

18:57.511 --> 18:59.721
like dull chit-chat over cheeseburgers.

18:59.805 --> 19:04.309
You need someone who's not afraid
to get his hands dirty.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.770
No, no, no, what is he doing?

19:06.854 --> 19:10.190
Maybe I should run for
City Council, I...!

19:10.274 --> 19:14.736
[LAUGHS] But you can't.
Because you're a minor.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.739
It is you. What are you doing?

19:17.823 --> 19:18.949
Severing ties, Claire.

19:19.032 --> 19:22.286
A true Trollhunter can't be concerned
with pointless personal connections.

19:22.369 --> 19:25.831
Fine. You wanna break up? Let's do this.
But somewhere private.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.418
There are some things to be said
that aren't for everyone's ears.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.837
So, what do we have to do to end...?

19:31.920 --> 19:36.550
You couldn't leave it alone, could you?
You've left me no choice. Glory!

19:44.683 --> 19:46.643
[MRS. NUÃEZ] Claire Maria NuÃ±ez.

19:46.727 --> 19:48.979
But I...! [GROANS] Coming.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.023
[GROANS] Oh!

19:51.899 --> 19:54.610
You should've allowed me
to be the Trollhunter, Lake.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.612
But now, you'll be nothing.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.074
We both know what's coming.
Why you need me.

20:02.075 --> 20:07.456
If those blood goblins got out, maybe
Gunmar did too! Maybe you let him out!

20:07.539 --> 20:08.874
No, that's impossible.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.335
[GRUNTS]

20:11.418 --> 20:15.255
Enjoy your stay in the Amulet
with all the other weak parts of you.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.841
[SHOUTS]

20:23.513 --> 20:25.891
Guess what? I can use it too.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.060
- [CLATTERS]
- [CAT SCREECHES]

20:31.063 --> 20:31.897
[EXCLAIMS]

20:36.652 --> 20:38.028
[LAUGHS]

20:38.111 --> 20:40.072
I'm untouchable!

20:43.033 --> 20:45.494
Get back up and face me!

20:54.544 --> 20:57.589
Ha! Not even close to a fair fight.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.051
You're right, it's not.

21:01.134 --> 21:04.179
What? No! You traitors!

21:04.263 --> 21:07.516
- You got sacked, yo.
- No, he's too strong. He'll kill us.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.978
- I just wanna make things right.
- I don't like your face.

21:11.061 --> 21:11.979
Â¡AdiÃ³s, Zapatero!

21:12.062 --> 21:13.397
Why are you helping him?

21:13.480 --> 21:18.944
'Cause they realized the same thing I did.
We're all stronger as one. Even with you.

21:19.027 --> 21:22.406
Lake! You can't get rid of me.
I'm a part of you.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.951
There will come a time you'll realize
you can't balance both worlds

21:26.034 --> 21:30.414
and you'll have to choose, then...
then you'll see I was right.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.417
[SHOUTS]

21:36.503 --> 21:38.422
Well, that's gonna require

21:38.505 --> 21:42.884
- about ten years of therapy.
- [CHUCKLES] You were great. Most of you.

21:42.968 --> 21:45.804
- [MR. NUÃEZ] Claire?
- [MRS. NUÃEZ] We need to talk about Jim!

21:45.887 --> 21:48.307
They'll come around.
They just need to meet the real you.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.225
But super-realz, um, you should go.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.436
- They wanna kill me, don't they?
- Don't worry.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.314
I never expected them
to like my boyfriend.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.607
- Boyfriend?
- [MR. NUÃEZ] Claire!

21:57.691 --> 21:58.692
Go.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.240
Boyfriend.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.742
Holla!
