WEBVTT

00:05.338 --> 00:06.549
What have we got here?

00:06.590 --> 00:09.134
Male, in his 30s,
with an arrow almost through his heart.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.719
And female, in her 20s, smoke inhalation.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.220
[male #1] Get him to the operating room

00:12.303 --> 00:13.848
-and have her taken to the ICU.
-Yes.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.856
[deep exhale]

00:24.608 --> 00:26.861
[Joon] <i>Well, I'd say
it's been a pretty rough day.</i>

00:27.945 --> 00:28.988
[Claire] Joon?

00:29.320 --> 00:31.406
[Joon's dad]
<i>Mmm-mmm, is it dinner time again?</i>

00:32.407 --> 00:34.577
<i>We've got five delicious meals here</i>

00:34.660 --> 00:36.202
that will be ready in just three minutes.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.663
<i>It's like having a world-famous chef</i>

00:37.746 --> 00:39.205
in your very own kitchen!

00:40.875 --> 00:42.835
There's no need
to go out for dinner anymore.

00:42.918 --> 00:46.379
Park Frozen Gourmet.
Leave the cooking to us!

00:46.463 --> 00:48.548
[Joon's mom] <i>You'll feel
like you're in the restaurant.</i>

00:48.632 --> 00:50.175
-Park Frozen Gourmet!
-Park Frozen Gourmet!

00:58.141 --> 00:59.142
[male #1] <i>Mrs. Park?</i>

01:00.895 --> 01:02.187
How is he?

01:02.270 --> 01:04.355
The surgeons are very optimistic.
You don't have to worry.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.107
[sigs in relief]
[Claire] What about Seo-yeon?

01:06.191 --> 01:07.735
She'll be discharged soon.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.820
[Joon's mom] Thank you.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.405
[Joon's mom] What was the emergency?

01:12.865 --> 01:14.033
I'm sorry?

01:14.115 --> 01:15.951
What did you drag my son
out of the house for?

01:17.410 --> 01:18.954
The... fire?

01:22.415 --> 01:23.959
[Joon's mom] I already lost my husband.

01:24.043 --> 01:25.920
I don't want to lose my son, too.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.175
[Seth] Well done, Claire.

01:38.766 --> 01:39.767
What do you want?

01:39.808 --> 01:41.101
You owe me money.

01:42.978 --> 01:45.105
I don't pay for missed targets.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.859
What could I do? He jumped in the way.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.319
I do have another idea.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.745
Do you still want me to kill the girl?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.249
No need.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.090
[clears throat]

02:13.341 --> 02:16.011
So you'll take me back to my world now?

02:18.806 --> 02:19.974
Sure thing.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.821
[doomed music]

02:37.282 --> 02:38.659
[body thuds]

02:44.081 --> 02:45.248
[Joon's mom sighs]

02:45.331 --> 02:48.626
[Joon's mom] You're just as stubborn
as your father.

02:48.711 --> 02:52.798
If you'd just quit the restaurant,
none of this would've happened.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.717
Mrs. Park.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.470
I pushed him too hard,

02:59.554 --> 03:01.849
just like I pushed his father too hard.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.435
Now my husband's dead

03:05.518 --> 03:08.354
and my son's in the hospital.

03:09.148 --> 03:12.525
[Ga-in] Don't worry, Mrs. Park,
everything will work out.

03:12.567 --> 03:15.278
I told you to trust me, didn't I?

03:16.404 --> 03:18.115
Thank you, dear.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.827
The fire caused enough damage

03:21.910 --> 03:24.621
to threaten your investment
in the restaurant.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.498
There's so much to repair and recuperate,

03:27.540 --> 03:29.168
I'm sure Joon will realize

03:29.292 --> 03:31.211
what needs to be done.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.051
[Ga-in] Just give him a little time.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.845
He'll make the right decision.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.930
[Joon's mom]
That would make me very happy.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.266
One other thing.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.061
Yes, Mrs. Park?

03:47.102 --> 03:49.063
This ring belonged to my mother-in-law.

03:49.687 --> 03:50.688
I've been keeping it

03:50.773 --> 03:52.440
for Joon's future wife.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.860
Shall we make it official?

04:00.074 --> 04:01.909
It's so beautiful.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.534
Do you like it?

04:03.576 --> 04:05.913
I better go have a word with the doctor.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.082
-You'll stay with him, won't you?
-Of course.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.707
I'll be back.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.462
[door opens]

04:15.421 --> 04:16.589
[door closes]

04:21.220 --> 04:22.553
[phone rings]

04:22.637 --> 04:23.638
[Seth] <i>Yes.</i>

04:23.721 --> 04:26.599
-It's all set.
-[Seth] <i>I'm ready, too.</i>

04:31.146 --> 04:33.648
[Ga-in] Sweet dreams,

04:33.899 --> 04:35.109
husband.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.361
[Seth] <i>Joon! Park Joon.</i>

04:40.781 --> 04:43.741
Dad, can I ask you something?

04:46.327 --> 04:47.620
Why did you do it?

04:52.667 --> 04:55.753
I wanted you to take over the company.

04:56.088 --> 04:59.216
My being gone was the only way for you
to realize your true potential.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.342
[Joon] But

05:02.177 --> 05:04.138
you could have talked to me.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.809
You made the right choice,
though, didn't you,

05:09.059 --> 05:11.186
by choosing to close the restaurant?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.063
I did?

05:13.188 --> 05:15.356
[fire blazes]

05:19.402 --> 05:21.113
[Seth]
Would you like to put out the fire, sir?

05:22.488 --> 05:25.242
Or would you like to save the girl?

05:38.922 --> 05:40.883
[Joon] I'll save the girl.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.304
[Joon's dad] I'm proud of you, Son.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.930
You made the right choice.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.849
Here. Let me.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.686
Joon?

05:58.192 --> 06:00.777
I'm closing the restaurant.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.947
That's a good idea.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.414
-I just need to see him.
-[female #1] You can't.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.672
I will call security!

06:26.011 --> 06:27.346
Seth, where have you been?

06:27.470 --> 06:29.014
This place is completely falling apart!

06:29.097 --> 06:31.432
-I know!
-Why did you save Seo-yeon?

06:31.516 --> 06:33.851
Now she thinks you are her, like...

06:33.977 --> 06:35.354
You know!

06:36.063 --> 06:37.397
Where are your glasses?

06:41.318 --> 06:43.611
Did you just get mad at me
for saving the leading lady

06:43.694 --> 06:45.155
from dying of smoke inhalation?

06:45.571 --> 06:47.865
Due to your stupid, risky play

06:47.950 --> 06:49.617
which almost burned down the restaurant!

06:50.118 --> 06:52.578
You know, when Dramaworld first sent you,

06:52.662 --> 06:54.289
I thought that there must,

06:54.373 --> 06:56.874
there must be a reason for this
incompetent white girl to be here.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.085
But for the life of me,

06:58.168 --> 07:00.337
I can't think of one good thing
you've done!

07:02.339 --> 07:04.465
I think it's time for you
to look at Chapter eight.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.397
Dramaworld made a huge mistake
when it let you in.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.650
Just go home.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.031
Excuse me.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.340
Oh!

07:45.840 --> 07:47.800
I'm so glad to see you're all right.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.844
I've had better days.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.512
[Joon] You were in my dream, though.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.681
Ah, was I?

07:53.890 --> 07:56.476
You were serving me dinner

07:56.559 --> 07:58.437
while the restaurant burned down.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.773
Well, I hope it fared better in your dream
than in real life.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.902
It doesn't matter anymore.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.279
I've decided to close it.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.072
Really? Why?

08:09.323 --> 08:10.656
I don't know exactly,

08:10.740 --> 08:13.868
but it seems like the right thing to do.

08:14.744 --> 08:16.288
In that case,

08:17.289 --> 08:19.041
what if I buy you out?

08:20.875 --> 08:21.876
Huh?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.046
[Claire] "Chapter eight,"

08:24.129 --> 08:25.546
"Exiting Dramaworld."

08:27.007 --> 08:29.967
"There are two ways a facilitator
may leave a drama."

08:30.052 --> 08:33.180
"The most common is to wait
for the series to come to an end,

08:33.263 --> 08:34.764
where they will be given the opportunity

08:34.847 --> 08:36.266
to exit through their original portal

08:36.350 --> 08:38.684
during the final credits
of the last episode."

08:43.856 --> 08:45.275
"However...

08:47.777 --> 08:49.570
occasionally,

08:50.322 --> 08:51.656
there are circumstances when

08:51.739 --> 08:54.242
facilitating the story

08:54.326 --> 08:57.620
requires a grand exit mid-season."

08:58.163 --> 09:01.083
[glum music]

09:01.166 --> 09:04.169
"This is easily achieved by death."

09:09.966 --> 09:11.426
God, maybe that's it.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.807
"Unlike the real world,

09:18.975 --> 09:22.770
death can be a temporary solution
to a permanent problem,

09:24.523 --> 09:27.067
so long as the proper parties benefit."

09:32.029 --> 09:33.532
If I'm gone,

09:34.740 --> 09:37.160
Joon and Seo-yeon will both be at my...

09:38.328 --> 09:39.954
my funeral.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.338
If this is the only way to save
Dramaworld, then...

10:10.985 --> 10:13.070
God, I love this place!

10:23.748 --> 10:25.875
My dying is for the best.

10:26.168 --> 10:29.421
No, not dying! Not dying, leaving.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.340
My leaving is for the best. Okay, okay.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.639
It's not real life, it's not real life.
It's just a TV show.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.184
My leaving is for the best.

Let me know if you need help
and I'll catch you up on everything.

Are you firing me?

11:02.412 --> 11:03.455
Yes.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.458
I think that's for the best.

I'm sorry,

But it's for the best.

but it's for the best.
