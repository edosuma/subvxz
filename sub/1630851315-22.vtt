10:00.077 --> 10:01.644
Started World War I.Simple act

10:01.688 --> 10:03.733
of violence changed
the course of human history.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.302
That won't happen on our watch.

10:07.345 --> 10:09.521
That's where you come in,
Adrian.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.306
What are you gonna do to me?

10:11.349 --> 10:13.830
We were thinking we can appeal
to your sense of humanity.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.832
My what?You administered the VX,

10:15.876 --> 10:18.052
created an international
incident in Manila

10:18.095 --> 10:20.794
with potential
to get much worse.

10:20.837 --> 10:23.492
But you have the power to stop
the much worse from happening.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.407
Choice is yours, Adrian.

10:25.450 --> 10:28.018
[sighs]
Someone got ahold of my kit.

10:28.062 --> 10:30.586
Must have put the VX in there.
I have no idea.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.633
Two out of three... again.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.593
We're gonna need the "who."

10:38.986 --> 10:42.380
Do you know what happened
to Gavrilo Princip?

10:42.424 --> 10:44.469
He was imprisoned
for life,

10:44.513 --> 10:47.168
put in solitary confinement
until disease

10:47.211 --> 10:48.735
ate away at his bones.

10:48.778 --> 10:52.216
But it wasn't disease
that killed him.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.305
It was the guilt.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.790
MILIUS: So?TENNANT: Alexi Babin.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.140
Uses the handle
Silver Moon on the dark web.

11:03.184 --> 11:05.403
Same man who hired the Freeloffs
to kill Corporal Cartwright.

11:05.447 --> 11:06.970
He contacted Dunne
in the same way,

11:07.014 --> 11:09.233
but this time they met
in person in Manila.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.234
Any idea where he is now?

11:10.278 --> 11:11.801
Dunne says no.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.760
But he's got the entire voyage
back to the States

11:13.803 --> 11:15.500
to be charged
and think on his actions.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.633
Got to thank you for the
assist on this, Charlie.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.898
Only so many perfect sunsets
in Phuket a man can watch.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.466
Besides, I never pass up
an opportunity

11:24.509 --> 11:26.598
to be on the most lethal class
of fighting vessel on Earth.

11:26.642 --> 11:29.471
MAN [over P.A.]:
Ship is at flight quarters.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.255
Green deck.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.431
Pleasure working with you.

11:33.475 --> 11:35.912
You, too, Tennant.
You mostly know your history.

11:35.956 --> 11:37.566
Mostly?You were right about
Gavrilo Princip

11:37.609 --> 11:39.481
dying in prison
from disease,

11:39.524 --> 11:42.223
but he never felt an ounce
of guilt for what he did.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.443
I like my version better.

11:52.015 --> 11:55.845
JESSE:
Alexi Babin. Former Spetsnaz,
Russian special forces.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.847
Took his very
particular skill set

11:57.891 --> 12:00.415
and made a killing
in the black market.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.157
Supplying war materials to
all sorts of nasty people.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.463
KAI:
At first in the former
Eastern Bloc,

12:05.507 --> 12:08.423
but he's been doing business
in Southeast Asia these days.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.425
He still connected
to the Russian government?

12:10.468 --> 12:11.556
He's contracted
for his old bosses

12:11.600 --> 12:13.080
from time to time,
so maybe.

12:13.123 --> 12:14.690
KAI:
He had a Marine murdered.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.126
The Freeloffs,
the two prisoners.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.780
I mean, is he trying
to increase tension

12:17.824 --> 12:19.390
between Russia and the U.S.?

12:19.434 --> 12:21.044
Guy doesn't seem all that
interested in geopolitics,

12:21.088 --> 12:22.698
just making a buck.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.960
JESSE:
We don't know that yet.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.788
But three of his murders
were on island,

12:25.832 --> 12:28.182
so it's possible he's here.

12:28.225 --> 12:29.836
TENNANT:
Dig into all travel
into Hawai'i.

12:29.879 --> 12:33.013
Especially from Manila.
Last place we know he was.

12:33.056 --> 12:35.145
I'm headed home.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.234
Listen, I know your
team's been working hard.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.715
But news will break about
the prisoner exchange.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.936
Kremlin's already posturing,
refusing any public peace talks.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.633
Gonna need to try
to smooth things out.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.330
How do you do that
if we can't talk to Russia?

12:46.374 --> 12:48.158
Pulling the Group together.

12:48.202 --> 12:49.812
Your back-channel club.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.205
When you call it that,
it sounds kind of silly.

12:51.248 --> 12:52.815
Where you gonna meet?

12:52.859 --> 12:55.339
Hawai'i. Unusual to gather
on U.S. or Russian soil,

12:55.383 --> 12:56.558
but these are unusual times.

12:56.601 --> 12:57.777
Maybe what everyone needs

12:57.820 --> 12:59.343
is a time-out.

12:59.387 --> 13:01.041
A little breathing room.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.478
We've all been caught off guard.
Now is the time to act.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.481
Or it's the perfect time
not to act.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.918
Just safer for everyone.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.312
You're worried about me.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.183
I'm worried about the situation.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.229
And me.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.187
And you.

13:17.231 --> 13:20.234
In how you pertain
to the situation.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.758
'Cause you like me.A little less right now.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.674
[door opens]

13:25.717 --> 13:28.024
Oh, here comes Big Fed.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.721
What do you got on Alexi Babin?

13:29.765 --> 13:31.201
Nothing. No known associates,

13:31.245 --> 13:32.594
no movements, not a hint
he's ever stepped foot

13:32.637 --> 13:34.422
in the States,
let alone Hawai'i.

13:34.465 --> 13:37.077
Big Fed's really bringing
her A game today.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.254
I am working as hard as you are.
And s-stop calling me Big Fed.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.952
Sorry. You know,
low blood sugar.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.347
[grunts]

13:46.390 --> 13:50.046
Ooh. Stemilt Cosmic Crisp? Hmm.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.743
Sure.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.180
While you struck
out tracking Babin

13:53.223 --> 13:54.659
in the real world,
I'm having better luck

13:54.703 --> 13:55.878
in the virtual world.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.271
What have you found?

13:57.314 --> 13:59.882
Financials. Always financials.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.492
Got bank accounts feeding
shell companies feeding

14:01.536 --> 14:02.580
other bank accounts feeding
other shell companies...

14:02.624 --> 14:04.539
So, you're nowhere, too?

14:06.106 --> 14:07.847
I just keep
unraveling the onion.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.413
Maybe we don't need the source.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.415
Hey, what...

14:12.460 --> 14:13.678
Pretty please?

14:13.722 --> 14:16.159
Okay, hold on.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.207
[typing]

14:20.250 --> 14:21.643
So, what's the play?

14:21.686 --> 14:22.992
Got a friend at
FinCEN who might help

14:23.036 --> 14:24.864
with some of these
shell companies.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.605
But it'll...

14:27.649 --> 14:30.043
it'll take a beat.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.306
[sniffles]

14:35.222 --> 14:38.268
So, you and Lucy seem... better.

14:38.312 --> 14:39.879
Yeah? You think?

14:39.922 --> 14:41.315
Did she say any...No.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.578
Oh. So y-you're just...

14:43.621 --> 14:45.710
It's my observation.Right.

14:45.754 --> 14:49.236
Well. Lucy and I
are friends now.

14:49.279 --> 14:50.759
Hmm.
Or trying to be.

14:50.802 --> 14:53.893
But for the other stuff,
you know, she's moved on.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.418
Has she?Yeah.

14:57.461 --> 14:59.594
Some girl named Skylar, works
in tech, lives in Diamond Head.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.204
Bit of a hipster if you ask me.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.904
Not that I'm invested.Mm.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.732
I-I can't say whether Lucy's
moved on, but I do know

15:07.776 --> 15:10.431
Skylar is gone.

15:11.693 --> 15:12.999
Wait, what?

15:13.042 --> 15:14.435
Didn't work out.

15:14.478 --> 15:17.090
Why are you telling me this?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.440
[laughs]
I'm just making conversation.

15:19.483 --> 15:20.745
You're telling me for a reason,

15:20.789 --> 15:22.182
like maybe I still
have a chance.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.835
I hold these truths
to be self-evident:

15:23.879 --> 15:25.228
there's no such thing as chance,
and I don't get involved

15:25.272 --> 15:27.013
in other people's dramas.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.928
Well, you are actively being
involved in mine right now.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.408
Okay. Okay, you want my take?

15:31.452 --> 15:33.019
You pushed Lucy away, hurt her,

15:33.062 --> 15:34.759
made her feel
like an afterthought.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.065
All right, no judgment.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.024
I'm the master
at all that, but, look,

15:38.067 --> 15:40.983
if you want her to know
how you really feel,

15:41.027 --> 15:42.985
you need a grand gesture.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.379
Compose a symphony,

15:45.422 --> 15:47.772
write an epic poem,
serenade her.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.949
Just go big...

15:51.037 --> 15:53.387
...or go home.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.606
[computer chimes]

15:55.650 --> 15:58.522
Oh, that's my friend at FinCEN
with a list of all foreign goods

15:58.566 --> 16:00.133
shipped in from
European companies.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.699
Including Babin's
shell companies.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.701
Looks like he sent
a-a cargo plane to Oahu

16:03.745 --> 16:05.138
within the last two weeks.

16:06.443 --> 16:09.098
Maybe Babin was
part of that cargo?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.449
[typing]

16:15.931 --> 16:18.586
LUCY:
We really think
a Russian black marketeer

16:18.629 --> 16:21.763
smuggled himself to Hawai'i
and is staying on a boat?

16:21.806 --> 16:23.330
According to Ernie,
the same shell company

16:23.373 --> 16:25.462
that sent
the cargo plane to the island

16:25.506 --> 16:27.464
purchased a boat
that's docked here.

16:27.508 --> 16:28.813
KAI:
It's a smart plan.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.554
No hotel records,
and he can move

16:30.598 --> 16:32.339
all over the island undetected.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.602
Boat slip's right there.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.954
Yeah, someone's on it.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.000
All right, Kai, see if you can
get eyes on Babin.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.566
Lucy, lock down our six.

16:54.187 --> 16:55.753
Jesse, I got
visual confirmation.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.581
[grunting]

17:14.859 --> 17:15.947
[screams]

17:18.341 --> 17:19.821
LUCY:
Federal agent!

17:19.864 --> 17:20.909
Hands up!

17:23.259 --> 17:24.739
Down on the ground.

17:26.393 --> 17:27.437
JESSE:
Oh, that burns.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.962
Y'all okay?JESSE:
No.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.660
She pepper-sprayed me.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.227
[engine starts]Wait.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.011
Wait, you hear that?

17:37.882 --> 17:39.449
Babin's fleeing!

17:59.600 --> 18:01.906
KAI: Alina Nikitin.
Tied to ops in Asia, Latvia,

18:01.950 --> 18:03.212
Lithuania, Bulgaria...

18:03.256 --> 18:05.127
All the -ias, really.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.695
Former Spetsnaz,
just like Babin,

18:07.738 --> 18:10.001
but now you work for the FSB.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.525
You're basically Black Widow.

18:11.568 --> 18:12.961
Well, thank you.

18:13.004 --> 18:14.528
KAI:
Pretty self-assured

18:14.571 --> 18:16.443
for someone who just got
caught operating on U.S. soil.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.662
Americans are so dramatic.

18:18.706 --> 18:20.490
You were trying
to take Alexi Babin

18:20.534 --> 18:21.883
and clean up Russia's mess.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.145
And so wrong.

18:24.625 --> 18:27.149
Babin orchestrated the murder
of half a dozen people

18:27.193 --> 18:29.543
and he set our nations
on a path toward war.

18:29.586 --> 18:31.936
And yet he is not
a Russian asset.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.069
Then what did you want with him?

18:34.113 --> 18:37.507
To bring him in so he can
answer for his crimes.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.335
Sabotaging
the prisoner exchange?

18:39.379 --> 18:42.033
And selling weapons
in Southeast Asia.

18:42.077 --> 18:44.732
Supposedly on behalf
of the Russian government.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.560
It's a false flag operation.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.170
Babin was busy long before this.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.738
So, who's he working for
if not you?

18:50.781 --> 18:53.654
If you ask my superiors, you.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.134
No. You don't believe that.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.526
Of course not.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.876
His plan is much
too nuanced for Americans.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.096
[laughs softly]
So you're saying Babin

19:01.140 --> 19:04.317
has been fueling aggressions
between Russia and the U.S.?

19:06.319 --> 19:08.016
Look, the only way
that we can stop Alexi Babin

19:08.059 --> 19:10.714
and whoever he's working for
is if we work together.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.673
[laughs]You need to tell us

19:12.716 --> 19:14.675
what else you know
about Babin.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.894
Alina, you got to trust us.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.853
I've been unfair.

19:18.896 --> 19:22.987
Russians and Americans
do share some traits.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.207
Military might,

19:25.251 --> 19:29.472
love of fighting, mutual
distaste for being second,

19:29.516 --> 19:32.562
but trust is not one of them.

19:36.958 --> 19:38.568
What time zone does
your body think it's in?

19:38.612 --> 19:40.570
Ah, gave up
trying to know days ago.

19:40.614 --> 19:41.963
[quietly]:
Yeah.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.573
Our Russian guest
share anything?

19:43.617 --> 19:45.706
JESSE:
Not much.
She's probably scared

19:45.749 --> 19:47.795
of retribution from the Kremlin.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.013
KAI:
But we did get
some truth,

19:49.057 --> 19:50.537
with a lowercase "T."

19:50.580 --> 19:52.408
She denied involvement
with Babin

19:52.452 --> 19:54.845
and claimed he was running
a false flag operation,

19:54.889 --> 19:57.021
so we're vetting all of it.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.980
But so far it tracks, though.

19:59.023 --> 20:02.026
With great conflict
comes great relief.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.246
Aid is flowing
into Southeast Asia.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.421
Most of it basic needs.

20:05.465 --> 20:07.423
Food, water, building supplies.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.338
Most of it through
legitimate sources, too.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.557
Governments, NGOs.

20:10.600 --> 20:11.819
And the rest of it?

20:11.862 --> 20:13.429
Not so much basic needs.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.039
JESSE:
War materials.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.651
Guns, munitions, drones.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.131
We sure Russia
wasn't behind this?

20:20.175 --> 20:21.655
Well, it all reads
like it's from Russia,

20:21.698 --> 20:23.091
but it's too obvious.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.571
Manifests from
St. Petersburg, Moscow.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.181
Flown in commercially.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.922
Yeah, FSB would be
way more careful.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.490
Something of this scale
goes beyond Babin's assets.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.275
Someone else must be
pulling the strings.

20:33.319 --> 20:34.450
Keep digging.

20:34.494 --> 20:35.538
Find Babin.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.584
If he didn't already bug out.

20:37.627 --> 20:39.586
He was still here
after both prisoners were dead.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.675
He's not done.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.465
Colin McIntyre, Special
Agent in Charge Jane Tennant.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.206
A pleasure, Special Agent.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.947
Oh, the pleasure's mine.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.557
I read your position
papers on the future

20:54.601 --> 20:56.167
of security in Southeast Asia.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.387
[scoffs] Then you're one
of the few that did.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.737
My old diplomatic work
mostly got lost

21:00.781 --> 21:02.652
in the shuffle.

21:02.696 --> 21:05.351
I'm hoping my second act
might bear more fruit.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.527
The Group is Colin's brainchild.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.180
An opportunity

21:09.224 --> 21:11.792
for honest discourse
between Russia and the U.S.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.489
Out of the spotlight.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.623
[phone vibrates]Less posturing,
more solution-building.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.668
At a time when it's most needed.

21:18.712 --> 21:20.714
The Russian delegation
just landed.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.324
So this is happening?

21:22.368 --> 21:23.673
Taking place off-base.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.066
You're safest here.

21:25.109 --> 21:26.763
Being surrounded
by the U.S. Pac Fleet

21:26.807 --> 21:29.244
and PACAF is not neutral ground.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.072
I'm not sure if Captain
Milius told you,

21:31.115 --> 21:34.293
but the person responsible for
sabotaging the prisoner exchange

21:34.336 --> 21:35.729
is at large on the island.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.383
We need to ease tensions.

21:37.426 --> 21:39.385
Even if it means
absorbing some risk.

21:39.428 --> 21:42.170
Risk is a reality
in our business.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.345
I've had death threats.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.738
A few attempts.

21:44.781 --> 21:45.956
A price worth paying.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.436
Time to go.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.048
I appreciate your persistence.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.531
So, where is this meeting?

21:55.575 --> 21:57.359
Location is need-to-know...

21:57.403 --> 21:58.708
And I need to know.

21:58.752 --> 22:00.188
...so I wrote it down.

22:02.451 --> 22:03.583
You might want to burn that
after reading, though.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.193
You should have proper security.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.412
We do.Established at the perimeter.

22:06.455 --> 22:07.630
Inside the meeting room.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.066
Handled.

22:09.110 --> 22:10.938
Babin isn't going away.

22:12.026 --> 22:15.029
You stop the bad guy,
I'll stop a war.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.901
Then, I don't know. Drinks?

22:25.822 --> 22:27.433
What happened?

22:27.476 --> 22:30.436
Tracking Babin's
proven... frustrating.

22:30.479 --> 22:33.395
I've, uh, never seen someone
break a keyboard before.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.658
[sighs]
I have spares. It's fine.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.921
It's not fine.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.401
It was a customized
TitaniumSeries

22:39.445 --> 22:40.968
mechanical keyboard
with tactile switches.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.187
O-Okay, um-- Well, hey, hey.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.277
Boom-Boom might have a
lead on the explosives.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.975
Yeah, but I'm gonna
need some help.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.194
TATP, the compound
used to take out the Freeloffs,

22:50.238 --> 22:52.022
isn't readily available
on the island.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.677
You're saying somebody shipped
in a highly explosive material?

22:54.721 --> 22:56.026
Acetone and peroxide
separately.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.680
And it was flown in.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.466
The TATP was manufactured here.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.511
The chemicals arrived
via cargo plane,

23:02.555 --> 23:04.034
so if we know where
they ended up,

23:04.078 --> 23:05.732
we might be able to find Babin.

23:05.775 --> 23:07.211
BOOM-BOOM:
Ernie, you think
you can construct

23:07.255 --> 23:08.996
a path of where it went
once it landed?

23:09.039 --> 23:13.130
Eileen, you shall not have
perished in vain.

23:18.092 --> 23:21.617
Whatever's coming next will be
bigger than what's come before.

23:22.879 --> 23:24.446
Yeah? How do you figure?

23:24.490 --> 23:26.840
Well, FSB doesn't send
such a smart, cunning

23:26.883 --> 23:29.756
and clearly talented
agent like Alina

23:29.799 --> 23:31.410
into this kind of
danger otherwise.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.151
Alina, huh?

23:34.195 --> 23:35.892
That's her name.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.720
It's her first name.You called her Black Widow.

23:37.764 --> 23:39.113
LUCY:
That was an interrogation
tactic.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.897
And how do you even
know about that?

23:40.941 --> 23:42.986
I watched the tape,
then researched her.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.772
She's one of the most impressive
operatives I've ever seen.

23:45.815 --> 23:48.992
She's okay, I guess, for someone
who got caught and all.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.778
Found it.

23:52.822 --> 23:56.347
Okay. Some shady paperwork

23:56.391 --> 23:59.438
with several layers of
third-party logistics companies,

23:59.481 --> 24:03.442
but a truck hauled the chemicals
to a warehouse here, in Olomana.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.921
Could be Babin's hideout.

24:04.965 --> 24:07.097
Attaboy, Ernie.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.624
What?

24:11.667 --> 24:13.277
Jealous much?

24:13.321 --> 24:16.716
Okay, you know what? You can
just clean up your own mess.

24:29.163 --> 24:30.686
Breach.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.079
LUCY:
Federal agents!

24:32.122 --> 24:33.428
Federal agents!

24:38.477 --> 24:40.479
AGENT:
Check. Check.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.568
Clear.

24:42.611 --> 24:43.612
AGENT: Move.AGENT 2: Clear.

24:43.656 --> 24:44.700
AGENT 1:
Move to the hallway.

24:44.744 --> 24:46.963
Move.AGENT 2: Clear.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.315
[sniffs]

24:51.359 --> 24:52.621
Oh, it's fruity.

24:52.665 --> 24:55.929
Guys, the TATP
is definitely here.

24:58.671 --> 25:00.281
Sure is.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.375
All right.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.637
Clear.

25:10.378 --> 25:12.293
Okay.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.949
Jesse, wait, wait![click]

25:19.213 --> 25:20.519
Oh, that's not good.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.129
Hey, Jesse, Kai.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.217
Lucy, don't...

25:24.174 --> 25:25.567
Don't come in here.

25:27.656 --> 25:30.441
If he moves,
this whole place could blow.

25:38.754 --> 25:41.017
I need you both
to leave right now.

25:41.061 --> 25:42.671
LUCY:
Babin's not here.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.021
Maybe he didn't finish.
Maybe it's not active?

25:45.065 --> 25:47.284
Not willing to let anyone else
find out the hard way. Go.

25:47.328 --> 25:49.983
KAI:
Lucy, clear the building,
tell Tennant what's happening,

25:50.026 --> 25:51.332
and, uh, get Boom-Boom.

25:55.815 --> 25:59.427
Everybody exit
the building now.

25:59.470 --> 26:01.342
That means you, too, pal.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.431
Unless you know
how to defuse a bomb.

26:03.474 --> 26:04.780
KAI:
Nah.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.216
I got to stick around
to find out

26:06.260 --> 26:08.262
how you can be this unlucky.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.046
[laughs softly]

26:10.090 --> 26:11.787
New guy's still got jokes.

26:13.484 --> 26:15.008
TENNANT:
What do you mean
Kai's still in there?

26:15.051 --> 26:16.444
Get him out.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.272
He won't leave.
I didn't want to, either.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.795
And Babin?

26:19.839 --> 26:21.057
Gone. But this
is definitely his place.

26:21.101 --> 26:22.624
We found a-a smashed laptop,

26:22.668 --> 26:24.191
the explosive material.

26:24.234 --> 26:25.540
He probably rigged it
to cover his tracks.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.802
Or he knew it'd slow us down.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.064
There may be evidence inside.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.500
No one but Boom-Boom

26:29.544 --> 26:31.328
goes back in
until the bomb is cleared.

26:34.201 --> 26:36.943
Jesse, Holman.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.771
What's new?JESSE:
Oh, you know.

26:38.814 --> 26:40.990
Same old, same old.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.470
KAI:
I think it's
a pressure-plate trigger.

26:42.513 --> 26:45.212
Armed when pressed,
detonates when released.

26:45.255 --> 26:47.083
Wires look like they go
to a plastic housing right here,

26:47.127 --> 26:48.955
connected to...

26:48.998 --> 26:51.871
BOOM-BOOM:
At least a hundred kilos
of explosive material.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.351
Which will catalyze
explosive reactions

26:54.395 --> 26:55.701
in other HME
in the building.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.399
You say that calm,
but it sounds bad.

26:58.442 --> 27:00.967
Oh, that's just
bomb-side manner.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.883
Hey.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.973
Hey, Boom-Boom, you really
want to be doing that?

27:08.017 --> 27:10.019
Oh...

27:10.063 --> 27:14.023
This bomb goes off,
I'm pink mist

27:14.067 --> 27:15.634
with or without it.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.333
Sounds even worse
when you put it that way.

27:19.376 --> 27:22.118
I can defuse it
so long as you don't move.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.646
[sighs deeply]

27:34.087 --> 27:35.131
You need to leave, Holman.

27:35.175 --> 27:36.872
No, I'm not going.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.613
Now's not the time
to be a pain in the ass, Kai.

27:38.657 --> 27:39.745
Hey, you used to think

27:39.788 --> 27:41.007
I was a pain in the ass

27:41.050 --> 27:42.704
for always going solo.Yeah, well,

27:42.748 --> 27:44.793
now you're being a pain in the
ass for sticking around.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.186
I'd call that growth.

27:46.229 --> 27:48.014
You know,
all that love is nice...

27:48.057 --> 27:50.538
BOTH:
"Love" is a strong word.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.280
But if you're
sticking around,

27:53.323 --> 27:55.282
at least be useful?

27:57.110 --> 27:59.460
Now, the wire's hooked
up to the car battery.

27:59.503 --> 28:02.071
That trigger activated a
current. Second it breaks...

28:02.115 --> 28:03.682
Pink mist.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.074
Let's stop saying that.

28:05.118 --> 28:06.249
Okay.All right, I
need to reroute

28:06.293 --> 28:07.598
the power source.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.688
My bag. Small black box.

28:09.731 --> 28:11.385
Okay.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.404
[beep]There we go.

28:30.447 --> 28:33.059
There we go, okay.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.151
JESSE:
So, how are you going
to defuse...?

28:38.194 --> 28:40.849
Whoa. You cut that wire
without telling us, Boom-Boom.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.764
We're still here, aren't we?

28:42.808 --> 28:44.418
That's a good point.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.942
BOOM-BOOM:
Well, all right, Jesse.

28:46.986 --> 28:48.770
Step off the plate.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.735
[phone ringing]

28:56.778 --> 28:59.650
Lucy? How's Jesse?

28:59.694 --> 29:01.478
JESSE [over phone]:
Peachy.

29:01.522 --> 29:02.697
Hey, Boom-Boom is the man.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.570
BOOM-BOOM:
Except we got
a different problem.

29:06.614 --> 29:09.008
Looks like several containers
of TATP are missing.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.488
How bad would it be
if it exploded?

29:11.532 --> 29:13.055
Think Oklahoma City.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.537
Okay. Uh, finish up.

29:16.580 --> 29:17.756
Get ready to move out.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.409
Jesse, Kai,
Boom-Boom...

29:19.453 --> 29:20.802
Yeah, boss?

29:20.846 --> 29:22.325
We're glad you're okay.

29:23.936 --> 29:25.981
WHISTLER:
Okay, so what's the target?

29:26.025 --> 29:27.809
Maybe we search events.
What's going on on the island?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.463
Games, conventions.

29:29.506 --> 29:30.986
ERNIE:
None of these
potential targets track

29:31.030 --> 29:33.249
with any of the events
that have transpired.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.729
No, everything
that's happened so far

29:34.773 --> 29:36.557
has been meant
to create a target.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.343
The back-channel meeting.

29:40.387 --> 29:42.606
Take out the people
who work toward peace,

29:42.650 --> 29:44.695
you put the U.S. and Russia
in another Cold War.

29:44.739 --> 29:46.001
Maybe even worse.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.611
Keep digging.
I'm gonna warn them.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.833
[door opens]

29:51.877 --> 29:53.922
We still don't know
who's behind this or why.

29:53.966 --> 29:56.359
Money. Of course it's money.

29:56.403 --> 29:58.361
Ever since Russia
amped up tensions,

29:58.405 --> 29:59.798
Babin's pocketbooks

29:59.841 --> 30:01.234
have gotten a significant spike.
