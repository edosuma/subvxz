(mellow music playing)

00:59.200 --> 01:01.333
I didn't know you were good
at making malts.

01:01.400 --> 01:06.100
Good? I'm an expert.
I worked in a malt shop in high school.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.133
-Soda jerk?
-No, thanks. I'll have a malted.

01:17.266 --> 01:19.200
Aren't you going to have one, Dorothy?

01:19.266 --> 01:23.734
No. After you've worked in a malt shop,
the greatest pleasure you can get

01:23.800 --> 01:26.734
is slurping what's left in the blender.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.700
(slurps)

01:32.100 --> 01:33.133
Yum.

01:33.633 --> 01:37.700
(slurps)

01:37.767 --> 01:40.133
Is it any wonder I never breast-fed her?

01:46.233 --> 01:48.266
What are you doing out,
I thought you were in your room.

01:48.333 --> 01:51.500
I whittled a gun out of soap
and overpowered the guards.

01:53.567 --> 01:54.967
I went to the mini-mall.

01:55.033 --> 01:57.667
They opened a little
slice of Sicily pizzeria.

01:57.734 --> 02:00.600
I walk in,
this guy strikes up a conversation.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.200
He's the owner,
and he wants me to be in a commercial.

02:04.266 --> 02:06.066
Sophia, that's amazing!

02:06.133 --> 02:08.667
I'll say. It's rare you find anybody
in a mini-mall

02:08.734 --> 02:10.266
who even speaks English.

02:15.066 --> 02:16.533
Ok, ok, Ma,

02:16.600 --> 02:18.967
where are you going
to shoot this commercial?

02:19.033 --> 02:21.834
Well, we discussed
many exotic locations,

02:21.900 --> 02:25.300
-and we settled on right here.
-Oh, now, hold on.

02:25.367 --> 02:28.300
I don't want a TV crew
messing up my kitchen,

02:28.367 --> 02:30.567
setting up all that video equipment.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.667
How about shooting it in your bedroom,
Blanche?

02:32.734 --> 02:34.700
The equipment's already set up there.

02:42.133 --> 02:44.200
Blanche, I don't think
you'll have to worry.

02:44.266 --> 02:45.533
It's not going to happen.

02:46.266 --> 02:48.600
Has anybody seen a small bottle of pills?

02:48.667 --> 02:52.400
-Brown bottle, Patton's pharmacy label?
-Yeah.

02:52.467 --> 02:53.500
Never saw it.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.734
Ma?

02:56.100 --> 02:58.200
Yesterday I was looking for the oregano

02:58.266 --> 03:00.200
and accidentally knocked
them into the sink.

03:00.266 --> 03:01.934
I forgot all about it.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.800
Great. I won't be able
to refill it till tomorrow.

03:05.867 --> 03:08.633
Tomorrow's a holiday.
Pharmacy's closed.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.567
Maybe I have another bottle in my room.

03:10.633 --> 03:15.200
How could you forget
to tell Rose about that accident?

03:15.266 --> 03:17.967
My memory's not as good
as it used to be.

03:18.033 --> 03:20.400
Nothing on me is
as good as it used to be.

03:21.367 --> 03:25.133
Once upon a time I had a butt you
could bounce a quarter on.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.633
Now you could lose
a krugerrand in the creases.

03:33.433 --> 03:38.700
(serene music playing)

03:44.767 --> 03:48.233
Hello. Oh, I hope I'm not interrupting
anything.

03:48.300 --> 03:52.467
Dorothy, meet my director Sy Ferber.
Sy, my daughter, Dorothy.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.100
Daughter? You're kidding.

03:54.166 --> 03:58.567
I assure you I won't be flattered
if you say you thought she was my sister.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.734
No. No. I just had an idea.

04:02.800 --> 04:07.400
We've got a family restaurant. A
mother/daughter commercial would be great.

04:07.800 --> 04:08.900
How would you like to be in it?

04:08.967 --> 04:13.734
Well, I'd have to check my schedule.
You see, I'm a substitute teacher.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.300
Please. So someone
else sets up the driver's Ed cones.

04:19.333 --> 04:23.100
All right, Ma.
Actually, Sy, I'd be delighted.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.166
Beautiful.

04:25.100 --> 04:28.400
Guess what? I'm going to be in
that commercial with ma.

04:28.467 --> 04:32.834
I told you I don't want strangers
traipsing through my kitchen.

04:32.900 --> 04:36.934
-We'll pay $1,000 a day.
-Allow me to give you the grand tour.

04:39.834 --> 04:43.433
-Don't come in here. Everyone out!
-What's wrong?

04:43.500 --> 04:46.800
The slightest noise
and my humpeflagle cake will fall.

04:49.700 --> 04:56.033
-Oh, why, why, why?
-Rose, honey, calm down.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.700
You can make another cake.

04:57.767 --> 04:59.834
We'll set it up over here.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.200
Dorothy, I'm going to put you right here.
Sophia, by the table--

05:03.266 --> 05:06.834
-Please leave. I'm very upset.
-Rose.

05:07.867 --> 05:11.433
He's paying me $1,000 a day
to make a commercial here.

05:11.500 --> 05:15.533
-I live here, too. I have rights.
-This will only take a second.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.934
Yeah? It'll only take a second
to knock you on your keister, buddy.

05:20.934 --> 05:25.233
If I wanted this kind of abuse,
I'd be directing <i>the Roseanne Barr Show.</i>

05:28.567 --> 05:31.166
-But, Sy--
-Look, the commercial is off.

05:31.233 --> 05:32.567
Just forget it.

05:32.633 --> 05:37.100
-Well, Rose, look what you did.
-I didn't do anything wrong.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.367
Rose, why are you acting like this?

05:39.433 --> 05:41.233
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about!

05:41.300 --> 05:43.200
Get off my damn back!

05:43.867 --> 05:47.266
(calm music playing)

05:49.467 --> 05:50.734
Dorothy, what time is it?

05:51.633 --> 05:53.500
9:30. Why do you ask?

05:53.567 --> 05:56.266
Phyllis Gluckman is giving me a ride
to acting lessons.

05:56.333 --> 05:58.934
If I'm doing a commercial,
I want to be good.

05:59.867 --> 06:04.734
Ma, the commercial is off.
The director changed his mind.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.133
Then he's coming back here to shoot?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.834
No, he doesn't want
to get anywhere near Rose.

06:11.133 --> 06:12.800
He'll shoot it at his studio.

06:12.867 --> 06:17.100
Then I get screwed
and have nothing to show for it.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.166
Welcome to show business.

06:27.133 --> 06:28.200
(car horn honks)

06:28.767 --> 06:30.367
Well, goodbye.

06:31.033 --> 06:33.300
-Hi, Sophia.
-Later.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.834
Hi, girls.

06:35.900 --> 06:38.500
Loved meeting your director
friend yesterday.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.300
-Rose, are you all right?
-Never better. Why do you ask?

06:51.367 --> 06:54.633
Well, maybe because
yesterday you acted like a crazy person.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.867
I'm sorry. I was a little on edge.
Don't worry. It won't happen again.

06:58.934 --> 07:00.667
Rose, what are those pills for?

07:00.734 --> 07:03.033
The doctor prescribed them
when I wrenched my back.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.400
I didn't know you'd hurt your back.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.367
It's an old farm injury from St. Olaf.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.500
I'll never forget when it happened.

07:11.567 --> 07:16.200
It was time to plant the crops,
but after 17 years of pulling the plow,

07:16.266 --> 07:18.033
poor old Bessie was worn out.

07:18.800 --> 07:22.400
-Why didn't you just get another mule?
-Bessie wasn't a mule.

07:22.467 --> 07:25.467
She was a big, fat lady
who pulled farm plows.

07:30.166 --> 07:32.500
For God's sake!

07:32.867 --> 07:34.533
What about tractors?

07:34.600 --> 07:37.533
Come on, Blanche.
If she was too old to pull a plow,

07:37.600 --> 07:39.867
how could she ever pull a tractor?

07:44.500 --> 07:49.867
Anyway, we had to till the soil,
so I pulled the plow and hurt my back.

07:49.934 --> 07:52.467
How long have you been taking these pills?

07:52.533 --> 07:55.066
I guess around 30 years.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.600
-30 years!
-30 years!

07:58.100 --> 08:02.767
Rose, I doubt that your doctor wanted you
to take those things for 30 years.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.700
What makes you such a medical expert?

08:05.967 --> 08:09.433
The doctor prescribed those pills.

08:09.500 --> 08:13.700
Have you considered the possibility
that you might be dependent on them?

08:14.233 --> 08:16.166
Are you calling me an addict?

08:16.834 --> 08:18.934
Well, I really resent that.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.033
You think I can't do without those?

08:21.433 --> 08:24.367
-Here. You take them.
-Oh, come on, Rose.

08:24.433 --> 08:27.467
No, I insist. Obviously,
you don't believe me.

08:27.533 --> 08:29.533
I think this is the best way to prove it.

08:30.300 --> 08:34.767
(calm music playing)

08:34.834 --> 08:36.166
(crash)

08:37.500 --> 08:39.834
Rose, what the hell are you doing?

08:39.900 --> 08:44.066
Oh, I couldn't sleep so I decided
to rearrange the kitchen cabinets.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.667
I'm sorry I woke you.
Go on back to bed.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.567
-Rose, what are you doing with these?
-Nothing.

08:51.633 --> 08:54.300
You were looking for those pills,
weren't you? Blanche, get rid of them.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.700
You can't do that.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.000
-Get rid of them!
-No!

08:57.066 --> 09:00.000
I thought you said you could take these
or leave them.

09:00.066 --> 09:03.066
That's true. Right now
I want to take them.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.400
(serene music playing)

09:11.300 --> 09:14.633
Rose, you can't stop taking these pills.
You have a problem.

09:14.700 --> 09:19.467
I can stop,
and I'll start stopping tomorrow.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.934
Boy, will you be proud of me.
You just wait.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.734
-Only I can't stop tonight.
-Why not?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.367
Because... because...

09:29.066 --> 09:34.100
because tonight is the anniversary
of the death of my beloved cat Fluffy.

09:36.433 --> 09:38.834
You have never had cats. You're allergic.

09:38.900 --> 09:43.300
Ok, it's the anniversary of the death
of my beloved brother Fluffy.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.734
You're going to have to do
better than that.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.133
Oh, give her some credit.
She's never told a lie in her life.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.200
Nobody does it great the first time.

09:54.400 --> 09:59.266
Look, the truth is
I can't stop tonight because I'm afraid.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.633
I don't know if I can.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.700
That's because you're hooked on these,
Rose.

10:04.767 --> 10:08.400
But, honey, there's a place for people
with this kind of problem.

10:08.467 --> 10:10.800
Please. What is she going to do in the
NBA?

10:16.800 --> 10:20.133
Rose, let us call
a rehabilitation center for you.

10:20.200 --> 10:24.834
No. I don't need one of those places.
I can't go to one of those places.

10:24.900 --> 10:28.367
-I'd be ashamed. I'd be embarrassed.
-What is there to be ashamed of?

10:28.433 --> 10:32.100
You have a medical problem.
Was Betty Ford embarrassed?

10:32.166 --> 10:34.200
Was Liza Minnelli embarrassed?

10:34.266 --> 10:37.033
She should have been.
Did you see <i>Arthur II?</i>

10:40.734 --> 10:41.734
Rose...

10:42.433 --> 10:44.133
you have to do this.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.200
No. I can stop by myself.
I can quit cold turkey.

10:48.266 --> 10:50.500
Cold turkey? After 30 years,

10:50.567 --> 10:53.834
doing it alone without professional help
could be dangerous.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.467
I won't be alone. I'll be with you.

10:56.533 --> 10:59.700
If you'll just see me through the night,
I know I can lick this.

10:59.767 --> 11:02.200
Are you in this with me?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
You bet.

11:05.266 --> 11:07.333
This is what friendship is all about,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.834
banding together
when the going gets tough...

11:10.133 --> 11:13.233
sacrificing sleep and personal comfort...

11:13.600 --> 11:16.433
putting someone else's need
ahead of your own.

11:16.934 --> 11:18.200
It's beautiful.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.033
Let me know how it turns out
in the morning. Good night.

11:24.467 --> 11:29.767
(mellow music playing)

11:30.934 --> 11:33.333
-You think is gonna work?
-I don't know.

11:34.166 --> 11:36.600
We should just go along with whatever
she wants to do.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.633
The important thing is
to keep Rose's mind occupied.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.133
Hey, give me some lipstick.
I'll draw a face on my hand.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.433
Ma, what are you doing up.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.500
I've got an hour till
my paper route starts

11:48.567 --> 11:50.467
so I thought I'd do some chin-ups.

11:52.734 --> 11:55.767
I was worried about Rose,
I'm a member of this family too.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.567
I'm sorry. Ma, that's really very sweet.

11:58.900 --> 12:03.667
Considering that we have to get up so darn
early tomorrow for that commercial.

12:03.734 --> 12:06.500
I said she was family,
I'd do anything for that girl.

12:06.567 --> 12:10.400
Well, is everybody ready for a spirited
game of Gubensprizter?

12:12.934 --> 12:16.100
Gubensprizter? You said
we were gonna play monopoly.

12:16.166 --> 12:17.834
I said it was like monopoly.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.500
Only instead of Atlantic City
they use St. Olaf geography.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.066
-Well, I'll be the bank.
-Oh, good, there's the cash box.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.667
-Honey, this is empty.
-Oh, I know.

12:28.734 --> 12:33.200
The St. Olaf bank was one of the first
savings and loans to go under.

12:35.033 --> 12:37.834
-Bad management?
-Bad contractor.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.934
They built the bank on
marshland and it sank.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.934
All that was left were a few
deposit slips and a pen

12:46.000 --> 12:48.700
with a chain attached to it
floating in the muck.

12:50.066 --> 12:51.734
-Amazing.
-My story?

12:51.800 --> 12:53.633
No my patience at this hour.

12:54.934 --> 12:58.133
-Can we get on with this?
-Ok. I'll go first.

13:01.133 --> 13:02.500
Four.

13:03.934 --> 13:07.367
It says... pick a card.

13:08.967 --> 13:10.133
How odd.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.066
I can either buy the library
or the phone booth in center of town.

13:15.467 --> 13:16.934
I'll buy the library.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.667
-If I were you I'd buy the phone booth.
-Why?

13:20.734 --> 13:22.500
People use the phone booth.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.767
It's my turn.

13:27.734 --> 13:29.667
Six.

13:30.166 --> 13:34.700
(laughs) What luck.
I own Lokinburten Avenue.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.867
-Games over, I win.
-You win?

13:40.667 --> 13:44.033
Rose, how? You bought
one street in St. Olaf.

13:44.100 --> 13:46.367
I bought the only street in St. Olaf.

13:47.834 --> 13:50.233
That means I'm gonna
tear down your phone booth.

13:50.700 --> 13:56.066
-This is the stupidest game I could just--
-Dorothy, Dorothy.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.100
I could just play all night.

14:03.734 --> 14:05.033
Set it up again.

14:06.066 --> 14:08.667
(mellow music playing)

14:09.433 --> 14:12.767
-Rose, how about a piece of Bundt cake?
-Oh, no, thanks.

14:12.834 --> 14:16.200
-I'll try some, Dorothy.
-Try some, right.

14:16.266 --> 14:20.367
Like it's some big experiment, like you've
got no idea what it tastes like...

14:21.734 --> 14:24.700
like you don't shovel it in by the pound
every chance you get.

14:25.233 --> 14:26.467
Ma!

14:32.367 --> 14:36.834
Girls, I really don't feel very good.
I gave this a shot. I can't make it.

14:36.900 --> 14:41.400
-Rose, yes, you can.
-I can't, Dorothy. It's too hard.

14:41.467 --> 14:44.667
I wish you'd all stop acting
like you know what I'm going through

14:44.734 --> 14:46.867
because you don't have any idea.

14:46.934 --> 14:51.233
I might not have any idea what it's like
to feel the kind of dependency you do,

14:51.300 --> 14:55.633
but there was a time in my life
when I tried quitting something.

14:58.233 --> 15:02.367
-Blanche, you don't mean--
-Sex, Dorothy. I tried quitting sex.

15:02.433 --> 15:04.233
Obviously, you fell off the wagon.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.266
And onto
a naval base.

15:12.033 --> 15:17.500
It was just after I'd lost George, and it
just seemed an appropriate thing to do.

15:18.133 --> 15:20.800
Of course it did.
Your husband had just died.

15:20.867 --> 15:22.133
So what? I hadn't.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.934
The point is,
I was still feeling vulnerable.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.667
I was afraid if I got intimate
too quickly,

15:29.734 --> 15:34.400
I might end up getting hurt,
so I just gave it up, cold turkey.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.100
And it worked for you, Blanche?

15:36.734 --> 15:38.200
Well, not entirely.

15:39.367 --> 15:41.967
Barely a month had gone by
before I started feeling

15:42.033 --> 15:44.533
those awful stirrings and urgings.

15:46.166 --> 15:51.767
I was like a spring-blooming peach bud
just ripened to dewy fruition...

15:52.567 --> 15:56.734
waiting to be plucked
by the first handsome man to come my way.

15:57.934 --> 16:00.166
-You were looking for some nookie.
-Exactly.

16:04.467 --> 16:06.667
Then came the moment of truth.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.867
There was a man.
He asked me to sleep with him.

16:10.934 --> 16:12.166
I said no...

16:12.767 --> 16:15.367
but I knew something
greater than will power

16:15.433 --> 16:18.266
was necessary for me to resist him,
so I called my sister.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.400
-She talked you through it?
-Better than that.

16:20.467 --> 16:25.734
She took him by the throat
and threatened to shoot him.

16:26.300 --> 16:28.300
Just because he made a pass at you?

16:29.700 --> 16:34.033
Oh, did I forget to mention
that the man was my sister's husband?

16:38.633 --> 16:40.567
-I'm going to bed.
-Ma, you can't.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.333
Yes, she can.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.934
We're not proving anything
by sitting here any longer.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.066
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.100
This means you're giving up
after getting this far?

16:51.166 --> 16:56.834
No. I can see the sun coming up.
It's morning. We made it.

16:56.900 --> 16:58.900
-She's right.
-That's wonderful.

16:58.967 --> 17:02.033
Congratulations.
I bet you feel better already.

17:02.100 --> 17:06.066
Oh, I really do, and mostly because
you guys were there for me.

17:06.133 --> 17:07.600
I'll never be able to repay you.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.800
Think nothing of it.
We were glad to help.

17:10.867 --> 17:14.533
I'm glad to hear you say that
because if I can't sleep tonight,

17:14.600 --> 17:16.200
we might have to do it all over.

17:18.934 --> 17:24.200
(serene music playing)

17:25.066 --> 17:30.066
When I say action,
pick up the pizza, taste it, and say,

17:30.133 --> 17:32.934
"mmm, that's a mighty tasty pizza."

17:33.000 --> 17:38.300
-Is everybody ready?
-Do I look at my mother or the camera?

17:38.367 --> 17:40.900
Look at the camera, and here's a tip...

17:41.433 --> 17:43.667
look at it like you're making love to it.

17:48.166 --> 17:51.100
It might help if you give her a reference
she's more familiar with.

17:53.367 --> 17:54.867
Ok, this is a rehearsal.

17:54.934 --> 17:57.500
We'll run through it once,
then do it for real.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.467
And...go.

17:59.967 --> 18:01.166
Guess what, Ma?

18:01.233 --> 18:06.433
I found you some real good pizza
like you used to get in Sicily.

18:11.233 --> 18:12.834
Boy, do you stink.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.934
Dorothy. Dorothy, relax.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Just try and be yourself.
I know you can do this.

18:20.066 --> 18:23.300
-I'll get it this time.
-All right, here we go.

18:24.266 --> 18:26.166
And...go.

18:26.767 --> 18:31.300
Guess what, Ma?
I found some real Sicil...

18:31.800 --> 18:35.333
Some... no. That's not it.
What is the line?

18:35.400 --> 18:39.233
I found some real good pizza
just like you used to get back in Sicily.

18:39.533 --> 18:45.233
I know what the trouble is.
There is something wrong with the line.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.834
-There's something wrong with the line?
-I'm an English teacher.

18:47.900 --> 18:52.133
The reason I can't say it
is because the line isn't grammatical.

18:52.934 --> 18:58.633
See, it should be "Really good pizza,"

18:58.700 --> 19:00.133
not "real good."

19:00.767 --> 19:03.967
Perfect pizza with pizzazz. Even better.

19:05.266 --> 19:07.400
Hey, I can act and write.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.433
Gee, I love this business.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.100
You don't mind if I make the change,
do you, Sy?

19:14.166 --> 19:18.100
No, not at all. I want to make a change,
too.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.934
Ok, Dorothy, let's see you smile.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.433
This one's for the camera.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.800
And... action.

19:33.934 --> 19:35.867
Look, grandma.
I found you a real good pizza

19:35.934 --> 19:37.767
just like you used to get in Sicily.

19:45.266 --> 19:48.333
Mmm. That's a mighty...

19:49.433 --> 19:52.700
that's a mighty lousy pizza.

19:54.767 --> 19:58.367
-Ma, you never tasted it before?
-No, and I never will again.

19:58.433 --> 19:59.834
What the hell are you doing?

19:59.900 --> 20:04.133
Sorry, Sy. You can't pay me enough
to endorse that slime on a shingle.

20:06.266 --> 20:11.133
Ma, this is a nationwide commercial.
There is a lot of money involved here.

20:11.200 --> 20:16.333
There are two things a Sicilian won't do,
lie about pizza and file a tax return.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.367
Forget it, Sy.

20:20.066 --> 20:23.767
(calm music playing)

20:25.433 --> 20:27.300
-Rose, spit it out!
-But, Dorothy--

20:27.367 --> 20:28.633
Right now, Rose!

20:34.934 --> 20:36.734
This is Fred Flintstone.

20:43.967 --> 20:47.767
His nose is dissolved,
but it's definitely Fred Flintstone.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.600
They're my vitamins.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.633
-Rose, I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
-Oh, don't apologize.

20:54.700 --> 20:58.333
-But I misjudged you.
-No, you didn't. Here are my pills.

20:58.400 --> 20:59.900
I took one last night.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.533
But you got through
an entire night without them.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.333
-I thought you had it beat.
-So did I.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.033
When you were staying up with me,
I felt like I was safe,

21:10.100 --> 21:13.066
that I could rely on your strength
to get me through it...

21:13.767 --> 21:15.533
but, Dorothy, you're not enough.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.467
These are even stronger than you are.

21:18.533 --> 21:22.467
-Let me call a recovery center.
-No, Dorothy.

21:22.533 --> 21:25.066
Listen, this won't just go away, Rose.

21:25.133 --> 21:31.467
I know... but I think the first step
is for me to make that call.

21:32.934 --> 21:38.734
(calm music playing)

21:45.166 --> 21:47.166
-Any sign of Rose?
-Not yet.

21:47.233 --> 21:49.033
Dorothy, I'm a little nervous.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.700
Rose was on those pills for 30 years.

21:51.767 --> 21:57.433
After one month in the hospital,
she may not be the same Rose we know.

21:57.500 --> 22:02.600
She may be an entirely different person.
I know because it happened to me once.

22:03.066 --> 22:05.867
Before my mama sent me
off to beauty camp,

22:05.934 --> 22:10.800
I was a pencil-thin,
flat-chested, four-eyed nerd.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.400
I don't believe it.

22:13.734 --> 22:15.367
You, pencil-thin?

22:21.367 --> 22:24.367
-Hi, girls.
-Oh, have we missed you.

22:24.433 --> 22:29.166
Rose, you look wonderful.
Give me a big hug.

22:29.233 --> 22:33.633
-We're so happy to see you.
-Oh, sweetheart.

22:33.700 --> 22:38.600
Oh, Rose, it just must feel wonderful
being cured.

22:38.667 --> 22:41.100
-Oh, I'm not cured.
-What do you mean?

22:41.166 --> 22:42.633
I'll never be cured,

22:42.700 --> 22:46.934
but I know I can live without drugs
one day at a time.

22:47.467 --> 22:50.333
I'm glad you got that monkey
off your back.

22:51.867 --> 22:54.700
I never had a monkey on my back, Sophia.

22:55.266 --> 22:58.767
Although when I was a child,
I had a chicken named Gordon.

22:59.700 --> 23:03.700
And what a great chicken.
He was a great singer, too.

23:04.200 --> 23:08.066
Gordon could cluck the scores
of all the big Broadway musicals.

23:08.633 --> 23:13.233
I've heard a lot of poultry do show tunes,
but nobody could hold a candle to him.

23:13.567 --> 23:17.500
Of course, no chicken
likes to be that near an open flame.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.266
Bless his heart.

23:23.133 --> 23:25.100
-Same old Rose.
-Same old Rose.

23:25.533 --> 23:30.066
Anyway, he was a great entertainer.
We thought he was a great dancer, too,

23:30.133 --> 23:32.800
till we discovered he had two left
wings...

23:33.633 --> 23:35.934
but he just shuffled along there.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.800
How he loved music,
especially Gilbert and Sullivan.

23:40.734 --> 23:43.600
I think his favorite was <i>The Mikado.</i>

23:44.567 --> 23:50.500
(theme music playing)
