WEBVTT

00:06.125 --> 00:08.125
[monkey chittering]

00:16.000 --> 00:18.666
[monkey shrieking]

00:18.750 --> 00:20.541
[siren blares]

00:20.625 --> 00:22.333
[sergeant] We haven't even processed it.

00:22.416 --> 00:24.458
Unis are puking their guts out
in that alley.

00:24.541 --> 00:27.208
CSI's still getting suited up,
and now I got this guy…

00:28.416 --> 00:29.250
Yes, sir.

00:29.833 --> 00:30.666
Yes, sir.

00:32.375 --> 00:33.208
Yes, sir.

00:34.375 --> 00:35.208
I understand.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.666
I don't know who the fuck you know…

00:44.666 --> 00:46.916
Hey! I don't care who you know uptown,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.166
you don't remove anything
from the crime scene.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.666
Chief says you got ten minutes
and then we're coming in.

00:53.750 --> 00:54.625
No more time.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.583
Do you understand? Do you hear me?

00:58.125 --> 01:00.500
-And don't touch anything.
-Thank you, sergeant.

01:01.208 --> 01:02.375
[sergeant 2] Whoa, hey.

01:02.458 --> 01:03.291
Sergeant.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.416
I don't know how,
but apparently he's clear.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.833
Don't touch anything!

01:38.500 --> 01:39.708
[dog barking distantly]

03:16.958 --> 03:17.958
[gasps]

03:19.416 --> 03:21.041
[gurgles, grunts]

03:24.166 --> 03:25.916
We got a survivor in here!

03:27.791 --> 03:29.375
[Roderick] It was the sprinklers.

03:30.916 --> 03:33.166
See, he'd tied into tanks on the roof,

03:34.291 --> 03:36.083
but they weren't there
to hold fresh water.

03:36.166 --> 03:38.791
We'd repurposed them
when we closed the lab,

03:38.875 --> 03:43.041
just tucked some unfortunate material
away to avoid the EPA fines.

03:43.125 --> 03:46.166
The idea was we'd come back
when no one was looking and dump it.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.125
It was…

03:47.791 --> 03:50.000
medical byproduct, highly acidic from a…

03:51.083 --> 03:52.916
less than legal development process

03:53.000 --> 03:56.250
and absolutely in violation
of multiple environmental regulations,

03:56.333 --> 03:58.250
but we couldn't… We had to keep it.

03:58.333 --> 04:00.833
We couldn't ship it out
because it was so corrosive

04:00.916 --> 04:02.750
and we shouldn't have had it at all.

04:02.833 --> 04:06.125
And the fines would have come
with charges, so…

04:07.083 --> 04:08.083
It was bad…

04:08.750 --> 04:11.375
and those tanks,
they were barely up to the task.

04:11.458 --> 04:14.791
It was already eating
through the tanks and the pipes.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.000
And we had another few weeks

04:16.083 --> 04:18.166
before we'd have a real mess on our hands.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.125
We were gonna take it out
while the building was demolished and…

04:21.208 --> 04:23.333
hide the extraction behind the demolition.

04:23.416 --> 04:25.791
Lots of material going in and out
of a demolition site,

04:25.875 --> 04:27.041
so no one would notice.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.458
[Auguste] Jesus, Roderick.

04:28.541 --> 04:30.416
And my son would have understood this

04:30.500 --> 04:34.125
if he'd paid a minute's fucking
attention to the family business. But no…

04:36.416 --> 04:41.791
He went off, hired a friend's
cousin's friend's friend

04:41.875 --> 04:43.250
to hook onto the main line.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.375
And they didn't test it.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.166
A horrible accident.

04:48.708 --> 04:50.291
[Auguste] Except for one thing.

04:50.375 --> 04:52.333
There's one thing that doesn't jive

04:52.416 --> 04:55.666
with the "horrible,
tragic accident" story.

04:57.458 --> 05:00.041
So you caught that, did you?
[chuckles softly]

05:01.041 --> 05:01.875
Go ahead.

05:02.791 --> 05:03.625
Say it.

05:04.416 --> 05:05.666
The wait staff.

05:05.750 --> 05:09.000
[Madeline] You said the wait staff
left the building. All of them?

05:09.083 --> 05:11.708
[Arthur] Could be a smoke break,
but that's the question.

05:11.791 --> 05:15.083
Why'd they all leave
at the same time just before?

05:15.166 --> 05:17.416
[Madeline] They knew. They fucking knew.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.208
Then someone set this up.

05:20.291 --> 05:21.333
How many dead?

05:21.416 --> 05:23.291
Seventy-eight. So far.

05:23.375 --> 05:27.208
Christ Almighty, the stock price
barely survived the indictment.

05:27.291 --> 05:29.791
Arthur, get into it
with a few friendly reporters.

05:29.875 --> 05:33.583
We say it was an underground party,
it was thrown by someone else.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.958
There's a few felons on the guest list.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.541
We put it on one of them,
keep Perry out of it.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.708
Camille's gonna be furious
you didn't go through her.

05:41.791 --> 05:43.125
This can't go through her.

05:43.208 --> 05:46.583
It has to come from outside the family.
Keep Camille miles away.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.583
It was someone else's party.

05:51.791 --> 05:54.291
Perry was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

05:55.208 --> 05:57.583
[Arthur] We've got the footage
from the cameras.

05:57.666 --> 06:00.666
He'd set up cameras.
My guys are scrubbing them now.

06:01.250 --> 06:04.250
If anyone there isn't who they seem,
I'll find out.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.458
I'm on everybody.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.291
[door opens]

06:08.375 --> 06:09.916
[panting]

06:11.250 --> 06:13.541
Sir. Sir, you can't just go back there!

06:14.250 --> 06:16.291
[Roderick] Where the hell have you been?

06:16.375 --> 06:18.416
-Oh, what happened?
-It was an accident.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.833
Just a terrible accident.

06:19.916 --> 06:21.916
[ECG beeping]

06:23.416 --> 06:25.250
[Roderick] Your brother's dead.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.916
Did you hear me? Your brother is dead.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.750
Yeah, dead Perry, got it.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.791
We have to call the other kids.
Sun's gonna come up soon.

06:32.875 --> 06:36.458
That means the fucking morning shows.
This is gonna get out any minute now.

06:36.541 --> 06:39.083
-You're right, we need to close ranks.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.000
Bring them in.

06:40.958 --> 06:42.666
[Arthur] We need to talk, Freddie.

06:43.166 --> 06:47.666
What the fuck happened? Where was she?
What… what is happening?

06:47.750 --> 06:50.541
We need to talk because when people ask,

06:50.625 --> 06:53.666
there are some things
you absolutely cannot say.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.083
[Camille] Fuck, that's terrible.

06:55.875 --> 06:56.875
Yes, it is.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.666
[Camille] It makes everything worse.

06:58.750 --> 07:03.291
The investigations, the lawsuits,
the fucking trial, it all gets juiced.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.875
Fuck's sake, Camille.
Our brother just died.

07:05.958 --> 07:07.000
[Camille] Half-brother.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.416
[softly] You fucking cunt.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.708
Say what you want, he was one of us.

07:10.791 --> 07:12.583
He didn't deserve to die like that.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.500
Fuck. [sniffles] No one does.

07:16.750 --> 07:20.000
-How come you didn't know about the party?
-What?

07:20.083 --> 07:22.583
Don't play coy. Knowing stuff
is your bread and butter,

07:22.666 --> 07:26.166
and Perry throws an underground party
at a condemned Fortunato building

07:26.250 --> 07:27.708
and you didn't know about it?

07:27.791 --> 07:29.625
No, he didn't invite his sister
to the orgy.

07:29.708 --> 07:30.666
Just his sister-in-law?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.583
[Camille] No idea how I'll keep that down.

07:32.666 --> 07:35.708
If the hospital doesn't leak it,
they're definitely gonna leak it,

07:35.791 --> 07:38.791
somebody will notice that Morella Usher
doesn't have skin anymore.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.041
[Madeline] That's enough.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.916
We need to close ranks here.
Really close them.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.833
You need to tell Pym to just stay
in his lane and leave the PR to me.

07:46.916 --> 07:50.916
Your father feels that this has to come
from outside the family.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.583
It's the opposite.
It's exactly the opposite.

07:53.666 --> 07:57.208
He's wrong because
Perry Usher died horribly last night

07:57.291 --> 07:59.375
in a preventable accident.

07:59.458 --> 08:00.875
That's public sympathy.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.541
We're gonna have something
we haven't had in three years.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.583
-It's public sympathy.
-Okay.

08:06.833 --> 08:07.750
What would you do?

08:07.833 --> 08:12.958
I… Two dozen memorial profile pieces
to start. I…

08:13.041 --> 08:16.916
Uh, "Perry Usher, America's son,
America's fallen prince."

08:17.750 --> 08:19.333
We'll turn him into JFK Junior.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.416
We can get, um, GQ, Us Weekly, USA Today.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.333
Get his face on the checkout aisles
of the grocery store,

08:25.416 --> 08:28.041
get his old friends telling
their best stories, like,

08:28.125 --> 08:32.666
"Hey, remember that time that Perry
drove a college friend to rehab?"

08:32.750 --> 08:36.500
Or no, um, "Remember when he financed
those village schools

08:36.583 --> 08:38.208
-in India and Africa?"
-[Leo] No.

08:38.291 --> 08:41.500
[Camille] That's why we've a charity wing,
so you paste someone's face on it.

08:41.583 --> 08:44.500
We remember that he did it, so he did it.

08:44.583 --> 08:48.125
He was very Paul Newman
about his charity work when he was alive

08:48.208 --> 08:51.541
but now that he's gone,
we can sing about it.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.708
But any attack on us
while we're grieving is an attack on him.

08:57.791 --> 08:58.625
What else?

08:58.708 --> 09:02.166
Multi profiles on Dad and you
and the siblings 'cause they'll carry on

09:02.250 --> 09:03.416
the charity work in his name.

09:03.500 --> 09:04.583
Picking up the torch.

09:04.666 --> 09:05.750
Pics of us at the grave

09:05.833 --> 09:08.625
but just long enough to say,
"Hey, no pictures, please."

09:09.125 --> 09:12.208
The Usher family feels lost,
just like anybody else.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.333
People are losing loved ones to opioids,

09:14.416 --> 09:16.541
we know what loss is.

09:16.625 --> 09:21.875
We grieve with you. So you grieve with us.

09:21.958 --> 09:25.250
But public sympathy
is a finite fucking resource

09:25.333 --> 09:27.250
and we can't let a man like Arthur Pym

09:27.333 --> 09:29.583
waste a precious limited resource
like that.

09:29.666 --> 09:31.708
We have a week, seconds count.

09:31.791 --> 09:34.833
I am running out of time,
I've wasted too much time already.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.666
-Okay. You're up.
-[sighs]

09:37.750 --> 09:40.208
You wonder why people hate us.
This is why.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.750
Actually, no.
If you're wondering how this family

09:42.833 --> 09:45.375
built its multi-billion dollar empire,
this is why.

09:45.458 --> 09:48.291
Because opportunity doesn't
give a fuck what you're going through.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.625
That's why they hate us.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.875
Not because we grabbed the opportunity,
but because they didn't.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.083
[Roderick] Eight goddamn months.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.958
[Frederick] I tried
to play it by the book.

10:00.041 --> 10:03.666
You always say keep them back so…
But the EPA, they were all over us.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.708
[Roderick] You don't need
eight months to take a building down,

10:06.791 --> 10:09.291
you need a few thousand bucks
and somebody to do the job.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.250
You were supposed to take
that building down.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.458
[Frederick] The permits--

10:12.541 --> 10:13.958
If you had done what I said,

10:14.041 --> 10:16.541
just got the Jersey boys
to take the building down…

10:16.625 --> 10:19.291
-Can we talk about this somewhere else?
-You did this.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.208
It was you.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.625
Hey, hey, honey.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.750
-[Lenore] What happened?
-It's okay.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.916
It should never have happened.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.166
[Lenore sniffles]

10:35.250 --> 10:36.791
Okay.

10:37.708 --> 10:38.666
Where is she?

10:39.625 --> 10:40.750
She's in surgery.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.583
She's in another surgery.

10:42.666 --> 10:44.708
What happened? What kind of accident?

10:44.791 --> 10:45.916
Where was she?

10:46.000 --> 10:49.708
[Auguste] Prospero Usher's death
is a tragedy.

10:49.791 --> 10:52.125
I was just saying that doesn't mitigate

10:52.208 --> 10:55.166
the pain and sorrow the Ushers have caused
while at the helm

10:55.250 --> 10:57.333
-of Fortunato Industries.
-Come on, get him.

10:57.416 --> 10:58.458
In the past year…

10:58.541 --> 11:04.083
nearly 50,000 people have died
from overdosing on Fortunato painkillers,

11:04.166 --> 11:05.541
and justice must be served.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.333
Are you saying that Prospero Usher's
death is justice?

11:08.416 --> 11:09.791
-There it is.
-[Auguste] No.

11:09.875 --> 11:11.708
-[reporter] What comparison are…
-Boom.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.833
…you making between accidental overdoses
and last night's events?

11:14.916 --> 11:16.708
[Camille] That is why I love Fox.

11:16.791 --> 11:18.625
Send the prosecutor an edible arrangement.

11:18.708 --> 11:21.166
He just bought us more days
of good [sing-song voice] will.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.666
Do you actually want to send
an arrangement? I can't tell.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.083
Toby, damn it, everybody knows
that edible arrangements

11:26.166 --> 11:28.791
are what you send to people you hate.
So, yes.

11:30.416 --> 11:31.375
What have you got?

11:32.375 --> 11:34.291
The Perry charity thing is sticking.

11:34.375 --> 11:36.625
Got a nibble outta Vox,
they'll eat anything.

11:36.708 --> 11:39.625
I'm not talking about bullshit,
I'm talking about the real stuff.

11:39.708 --> 11:40.666
What'd you get on Vic?

11:40.750 --> 11:43.958
The only thing that saves this family
is publicly executing the informant.

11:44.041 --> 11:46.583
The interesting thing is with the animals.
Test animals.

11:46.666 --> 11:49.875
It's not the number of dying animals,
that's market norm like you said.

11:49.958 --> 11:52.291
The problem is with the livestock count.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.833
-What do you mean?
-[Tina] The numbers don't work.

11:54.916 --> 11:56.125
There's animals missing.

11:59.875 --> 12:00.708
Go on.

12:00.791 --> 12:03.416
[Toby] The numbers track
when an animal death is reported

12:03.500 --> 12:04.708
during a trial,

12:04.791 --> 12:07.791
but when the animal
is supposed to have survived a procedure…

12:07.875 --> 12:10.041
…the inventory dumps a day or two later.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.750
One less monkey on the grounds,

12:11.833 --> 12:14.375
no explanation, no report,
no adjustment addendum.

12:15.083 --> 12:17.333
The numbers are just changed.

12:17.416 --> 12:18.583
What do they think?

12:18.666 --> 12:20.250
[Toby] Just about no one knows.

12:20.333 --> 12:22.750
No, what do the lab employees think?

12:22.833 --> 12:25.416
What're the rumors?
What do they talk about on their break?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
[Tina] The rumor is
that she swaps them out.

12:27.583 --> 12:29.458
A chimpanzee dies on the table,

12:29.541 --> 12:32.125
rumor is she pulls another,
shaves its chest,

12:32.208 --> 12:35.750
makes an identical incision,
even stitches it up.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.125
And claims that the animal survived.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.500
That's tough.
She'd have to get rid of the other one.

12:44.583 --> 12:45.791
[Toby] And retrieve the tech.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.625
Which is tough
because there are cameras and personnel.

12:48.708 --> 12:53.166
The rumor is that she cuts them up
after hours

12:53.250 --> 12:55.583
and carries them out in pieces.

12:55.666 --> 12:58.875
There's been jokes about her lining
the inside of her Birkin bag

12:58.958 --> 13:01.583
with plastic and taking the pieces
to an incinerator.

13:01.666 --> 13:03.416
Wow. [chuckles]

13:04.625 --> 13:05.916
Um, okay.

13:06.666 --> 13:07.500
Okay…

13:09.083 --> 13:11.083
How solid is your connection
at the RUE morgue?

13:11.166 --> 13:13.083
It's passable. Not firm, not flimsy.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.000
Get me tape.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.166
Camille?

13:17.250 --> 13:18.166
[Camille] Mmm-hmm?

13:19.083 --> 13:20.250
We're really sorry.

13:22.083 --> 13:22.916
For your loss.

13:28.791 --> 13:29.833
[sighs]

13:31.666 --> 13:34.583
There's a balance there.
It's an unfortunate balance.

13:34.666 --> 13:38.333
But it is a balance.
And one that I don't think we can afford…

13:38.416 --> 13:40.416
[reporters clamoring]

13:41.833 --> 13:43.458
[Alessandra] Jesus, get in here.

13:43.541 --> 13:45.916
Sorry about that. How are you? You okay?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.875
Oh, yeah, I'm just peachy.

13:47.958 --> 13:48.958
Okay, let's go.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.791
I'm rescheduling what I can.
I want to get you out of town.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.666
-Babe, honestly, I was hoping for lunch.
-[chuckling] No, I mean it.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.916
I'm here for you.

14:02.416 --> 14:04.791
I got two more to see
and then I'm all yours.

14:05.208 --> 14:06.666
-Okay.
-We'll hunker down.

14:06.750 --> 14:07.583
Okay?

14:08.791 --> 14:13.291
Stay here, drink your tea,
I'll be 20 minutes. 30 tops. Stay.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.333
[sniffles]

14:35.416 --> 14:36.541
[whimpers]

14:46.125 --> 14:48.125
[sniffles, exhales]

14:48.208 --> 14:49.458
[Verna] Oh!

14:49.541 --> 14:52.000
I'm… I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.166
Ugh, I should watch where I'm going.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.000
-You think?
-I'm all turned around.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.000
I was supposed to give this
to the receptionist

14:59.083 --> 15:01.166
but she's gone and I can't find anybody.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.958
Look. You can just leave it
at the receptionist's desk.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.125
I would, but it's got all my information.

15:06.791 --> 15:09.416
I don't care who knows
about my heart issues

15:09.500 --> 15:13.750
but I'd hate for them to see
my social security number.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.666
Isn't it awful that we live in that world?

15:15.750 --> 15:17.583
If you have heart issues,

15:18.500 --> 15:23.416
well, you really are in the right place
because Dr. Ruiz, she's… She's the best.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.833
Look, why don't I take you to her office?

15:25.916 --> 15:28.166
Make sure your paperwork
gets to the top of her pile?

15:28.250 --> 15:30.791
[breathing heavily] That'd be wonderful.
Thank you.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.000
All right, then. You… You all right?

15:33.833 --> 15:38.458
Yeah, I just… I have irregular heartbeats,
I get tired easily.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.083
Well, um, I can take this.

15:40.708 --> 15:41.541
You go sit down.

15:43.583 --> 15:44.416
You work here?

15:45.833 --> 15:47.500
Yeah, yeah. I work with Dr. Ruiz.

15:49.583 --> 15:50.416
Oh.

15:52.375 --> 15:53.375
[chuckles softly]

15:54.125 --> 15:55.083
How wonderful.

15:56.375 --> 15:57.958
[chuckles]

15:58.041 --> 15:58.875
Have a seat.

16:23.541 --> 16:29.250
[chuckles] You're just…
You're just perfect, aren't you?

16:29.333 --> 16:32.291
[Julius muffled] Leo. Leo.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.083
Hey.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.416
[louder] Hey!

16:39.125 --> 16:41.708
-What are you doing here?
-I texted you an hour ago.

16:43.291 --> 16:44.125
Really?

16:44.708 --> 16:48.083
-Guess my edible's kicking in.
-I have to prep you. You're first up.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.958
You have GQ, USA Today
and PC Gamer tomorrow.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.416
And so we have to pre-game.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.291
Also, Perry's dead, the family's fucked,

16:55.375 --> 16:58.708
you're the frontline of my PR campaign
and you just took an edible?

17:01.791 --> 17:02.625
You want some?

17:04.416 --> 17:05.750
I mean, yeah, I want some.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.916
[snorting]

17:08.000 --> 17:09.458
-Easy, tiger.
-[clears throat]

17:10.208 --> 17:13.333
I was getting too down
and this will even me out.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.125
I know what I'm doing. [exhales]

17:16.291 --> 17:17.458
Another glass, Camille?

17:18.625 --> 17:19.458
Yeah.

17:20.625 --> 17:21.458
I think I do.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.291
[Leo] Mmm.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.125
I like him. I think he's great.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.875
I think that you should bring him
around to the family

17:30.958 --> 17:34.375
and introduce him to the family
because he's got a keeper bod.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.916
Please give me relationship advice.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.625
Or have your assistants do it.

17:39.708 --> 17:42.208
Did you know that Tammy and Froderick
call us "the bastards"?

17:42.291 --> 17:43.708
You, me and Perry?

17:43.791 --> 17:45.833
-And Vic.
-[Camille] Yeah, fuck Vic.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.916
[chuckling] Why do you hate Vic so much?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.333
They do though.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.041
They call us "the bastards".

17:51.750 --> 17:53.541
How old were you when you met the old man?

17:53.625 --> 17:54.458
Eighteen.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.041
[Camille] That's right. I was 20.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.750
Oh, thank you, I love you.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.958
Leo loves you too.
He says you're getting engaged.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.958
Did he mean it or is it just the edibles
and the pot and the speed

18:07.041 --> 18:09.416
and the wine
and the coke and the pills talking?

18:09.500 --> 18:10.375
I was 18.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.458
I just said that. Right?

18:13.541 --> 18:16.125
He was just so little,
when he showed up. Perry.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.875
He was 16 when he found out.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.333
Rags to fucking riches.

18:20.416 --> 18:21.916
He was just a teenager.

18:23.791 --> 18:25.416
No wonder he was fucked up.

18:25.500 --> 18:29.083
If you start thinking this is reality,
you'll just slip into the abyss.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.125
You're speaking for yourself.
I stayed out of that.

18:32.208 --> 18:34.083
-Now that's bullshit.
-Bullshit, what?

18:34.916 --> 18:37.750
I make video games.
[hesitates] You know. [chuckles]

18:37.833 --> 18:41.916
[sputters] I'm not part of the whole…
Usher pharma bollocks.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.791
Like, I make video games, you know?

18:44.583 --> 18:46.458
[Camille] You don't make video games.

18:46.541 --> 18:49.666
You give money to people
who make video games.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.041
But you don't make shit.

18:51.125 --> 18:54.958
Um, like, Froderick
is this Roderick Usher cover band

18:55.041 --> 18:57.625
and he's playing the hits,
but it's sort of off-key,

18:57.708 --> 19:02.208
and Tammy is basically just Goop with,
like, a big golden bug sticker on it.

19:02.291 --> 19:06.500
And it's not even her face on the product,
it's BILLT, the fucking fitness clown,

19:06.583 --> 19:09.625
and then Vic's heart mesh
isn't even her heart mesh,

19:09.708 --> 19:12.666
it's the surgeon's heart mesh,
that's why she's fucking the surgeon,

19:12.750 --> 19:17.166
and you're like this amazing,
I don't know, like, Xbox Gatsby.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.916
-[Leo] Wow.
-And I just spin.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.958
Dad decided that I belong
in a room of smoke and mirrors,

19:25.041 --> 19:26.541
and I'm like a ceiling fan

19:26.625 --> 19:29.583
and I spin and I spin and I spin
and I don't go anywhere.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.416
Ushers don't make stuff.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.041
None of us.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.125
[R & B song playing]

19:38.958 --> 19:41.416
-Okay, I'm still stuck on Xbox Gatsby.
-[Pluto meowing]

19:41.500 --> 19:42.791
-Oh, fuck this--
-[Julius] No.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.416
-You got a cat?
-[Julius] She's mine.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.666
Hey, Pluto, leave Daddy Leo alone.
He's grieving.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.083
-[kisses]
-[doorbell rings]

19:50.166 --> 19:51.916
And here come some fellow grievers.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.416
-[Pluto meows]
-Company.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.916
Yeah, having a little party.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.416
Take my mind off things.
It's what Perry would've wanted.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.041
Yes, that's my cue to go.

19:59.125 --> 20:02.375
Tomorrow morning, I need you to…

20:05.250 --> 20:06.541
I need you to nail it.

20:07.458 --> 20:10.666
You're my opening volley.
There you go, boom, you're prepped.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.875
Hey, you want to stay?

20:13.958 --> 20:18.083
It's nothing huge, just a few friends,
some top-shelf shit. Designer stuff.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.458
[snorting] I'm aiming for total blackout.

20:20.541 --> 20:23.708
Wow. I don't know who wouldn't want to be
ringside for that,

20:23.791 --> 20:26.583
but no, I'm gonna
let you grieve yourself

20:26.666 --> 20:29.166
-into a coma by yourself.
-[knock on door]

20:29.250 --> 20:30.375
Please be careful.

20:30.458 --> 20:33.833
I'll move the mags till… the afternoon.

20:33.916 --> 20:36.833
-Hey, I invented careful.
-[Julius] Hey guys, how are you?

20:36.916 --> 20:39.041
[woman] Hey, good.
Haven't seen you in a long time.

20:39.125 --> 20:39.958
[Leo] Hey!

20:40.041 --> 20:42.416
-[Julius] It has been a while, right?
-[man] Sure.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.083
-[woman 1] Wanna bring it in and chill?
-I can get it.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.833
[woman 2] I need something already.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.375
-Hey, Leo.
-Hey…

20:48.458 --> 20:50.166
-I brought some Monty.
-Oh!

20:50.250 --> 20:51.791
[woman 2] You want some Monty?

20:51.875 --> 20:53.041
[groans]

20:53.125 --> 20:55.958
[Roderick] Death was something new
for my children.

20:56.041 --> 20:58.041
They really hadn't faced it.

20:59.083 --> 21:03.458
But like with all other things,
Ushers adapt quickly.

21:03.541 --> 21:06.208
One thing I tried to teach them,
the art of the pivot.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.041
When life hands you lemons…

21:09.125 --> 21:10.208
Make lemonade?

21:12.125 --> 21:12.958
[sighs]

21:15.000 --> 21:15.833
No.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.375
[piano music playing]

21:23.083 --> 21:25.208
First you roll out a multi-media campaign

21:25.291 --> 21:28.291
to convince people lemons
are incredibly scarce,

21:28.375 --> 21:33.125
which only works if you stockpile lemons,
control the supply, then a… A media blitz.

21:34.416 --> 21:37.791
Lemon is the only way to say "I love you,"
the must-have accessory

21:37.875 --> 21:40.333
for engagements or anniversaries.

21:40.416 --> 21:43.291
Roses are out, lemons are in.

21:43.375 --> 21:46.833
Billboards that say she won't have sex
with you unless you got lemons.

21:46.916 --> 21:48.250
You cut De Beers in on it.

21:48.875 --> 21:52.625
Limited edition lemon bracelets,
yellow diamonds called lemon drops.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.833
You get Apple to call their new operating
system OS-Lemón.

21:55.916 --> 21:57.833
A little accent over the "o".

21:57.916 --> 22:02.750
You charge 40% more for organic lemons,
50% more for conflict-free lemons.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.958
You pack the Capitol with lemon lobbyists,

22:05.041 --> 22:08.208
you get a Kardashian to suck
a lemon wedge in a leaked sex tape.

22:09.958 --> 22:12.750
Timothée Chalamet wears lemon shoes
at Cannes.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.750
Get a hashtag campaign.

22:15.833 --> 22:20.125
Something isn't "cool" or "tight"
or "awesome", no, it's "lemon".

22:21.333 --> 22:22.583
"Did you see that movie?"

22:22.666 --> 22:25.375
"Did you go to that concert?
It was effing lemon."

22:26.833 --> 22:30.666
Billie Eilish, "OMG, hashtag… lemon."

22:32.083 --> 22:34.750
You get Dr. Oz to recommend
four lemons a day

22:34.833 --> 22:37.750
and a lemon suppository supplement
to get rid of toxins

22:37.833 --> 22:41.333
'cause there's nothing scarier
than toxins.

22:41.416 --> 22:42.750
Then you patent the seeds.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.250
You write a line of genetic code

22:47.333 --> 22:50.291
that makes lemons look
just a little more like tits…

22:50.375 --> 22:53.666
and you get a gene patent
for the tit-lemon DNA sequence,

22:53.750 --> 22:55.958
you cross-pollinate…

22:56.041 --> 22:58.583
you get those seeds circulating
in the wild,

22:58.666 --> 23:01.375
and then you sue the farmers
for copyright infringement

23:01.458 --> 23:03.708
when that genetic code
shows up on their land.

23:04.291 --> 23:08.041
Sit back, rake in the millions,
and then, when you're done,

23:08.750 --> 23:11.500
and you've sold your lem-pire
for a few billion dollars,

23:11.583 --> 23:14.583
then, and only then,
you make some fucking lemonade.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.125
[storm rumbling]

23:25.708 --> 23:27.375
[sighs]

23:30.708 --> 23:33.083
Perry had some interesting drugs
in his system.

23:33.916 --> 23:38.375
In fact, his autopsy toxicology report
said he had Monty in his system.

23:39.208 --> 23:41.458
Didn't make lemonade
out of that one, did you?

23:42.125 --> 23:43.333
What the fuck is Monty?

23:43.416 --> 23:47.708
It's a street-engineered derivative
of Ligodone. Your drug.

23:48.416 --> 23:49.666
In his system.

23:49.750 --> 23:50.583
When he died.

23:50.666 --> 23:52.166
Well, this is what I'm saying.

23:53.291 --> 23:54.625
This happens all the time.

23:55.458 --> 23:58.958
Amateur chemists take a run
at a quality FDA-approved drug,

23:59.041 --> 24:00.250
they modify it.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.375
There's been dozens.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.250
Angel Tears. Downset. Now…

24:05.000 --> 24:07.208
Monty, I suppose?

24:07.291 --> 24:09.916
That was redacted
from the original coroner's report.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.958
That was withheld for more than a week.

24:13.041 --> 24:15.500
And you didn't know that, did you?

24:15.583 --> 24:19.541
My attorney, Arthur Pym, is protective.

24:19.625 --> 24:22.041
And he's very, very good. As you know.

24:22.583 --> 24:24.208
He obliterated your case, so…

24:29.375 --> 24:30.208
What is it?

24:32.583 --> 24:33.875
[breathing heavily]

24:51.000 --> 24:51.833
Apologies, I…

25:04.291 --> 25:05.458
I think I need another.

25:06.250 --> 25:07.583
What say you, Auggie?

25:07.666 --> 25:08.541
I'm good.

25:08.625 --> 25:10.750
[Roderick] Well, Ligodone, I'll be honest,

25:10.833 --> 25:15.416
there are days when I wish I had never
stumbled on that little pill.

25:16.250 --> 25:17.208
I was a bit naive.

25:17.791 --> 25:20.791
Truth be told, I…
You can't help it when you're young. You…

25:22.500 --> 25:24.375
God, you assume a lot.

25:24.958 --> 25:28.666
Like you assume the chemist isn't lying
about the addictive properties.

25:28.750 --> 25:32.458
You assume your company will act ethically
with your pitch and you assume--

25:33.541 --> 25:34.791
[glass shatters]

25:36.041 --> 25:38.041
[breathing heavily]

25:45.041 --> 25:46.291
You know, it wasn't mine.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.541
Is what I'm saying. Ligodone.

25:48.625 --> 25:51.375
You fucking throw that at me, all glib,
implying what?

25:51.458 --> 25:52.875
That Ligodone killed my son?

25:52.958 --> 25:56.458
I didn't make the drug. I didn't design
the drug. Ligodone is not my--

25:56.541 --> 25:58.541
Roderick, you said
you killed Perry, not me.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.875
Not with… No, not with the drug.
Fuck, you're not listening.

26:01.958 --> 26:02.791
That's not how…

26:13.125 --> 26:15.625
-[liquid pours]
-[bottle thuds]

26:24.291 --> 26:25.500
[sighs]

26:26.166 --> 26:29.125
You know, Ligodone…
[hesitates] …it's a lot of things…

26:30.583 --> 26:31.541
to a lot of people.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.916
I'm just as much a victim
of it as anybody else.

26:35.958 --> 26:36.833
I'm a middleman.

26:37.583 --> 26:38.916
But it's not my drug.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.458
It was never my drug.

26:42.625 --> 26:45.000
-This is my drug.
-Stop! Wait, you can't just--

26:45.083 --> 26:48.541
[Roderick] No, I found the chemist,
I walked this in here and you passed.

26:48.625 --> 26:51.791
Now what's this bullshit
about Fortunato buying Landor Pharma?

26:51.875 --> 26:53.333
He pushed past me.

26:53.416 --> 26:54.250
It's okay.

26:59.916 --> 27:01.166
All right, suit yourself.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.625
So I got to thinking. And you were right.

27:09.458 --> 27:12.000
Ligodone, a fucking gold mine. [laughs]

27:12.083 --> 27:13.458
Look, that was my pitch.

27:13.541 --> 27:16.208
I'm sorry. You have an exclusive
agreement with Landor Pharma?

27:16.291 --> 27:17.208
-No, but I--
-No?

27:17.291 --> 27:19.208
-Me and Metzer, we papered a deal.
-Mmm.

27:19.291 --> 27:22.541
Yeah, well, he developed Ligodone
at Landor.

27:22.625 --> 27:26.416
They own it. Metzer doesn't own anything.
He wasn't at liberty to make that deal.

27:26.500 --> 27:27.583
It's in his contract.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.208
Any intellectual property he creates
while in their employ…

27:30.291 --> 27:31.125
No, no.

27:31.208 --> 27:33.333
…utilizing Landor's facilities
shall remain the sole--

27:33.416 --> 27:35.916
No, he told me that he created it,
he owns it. It's his.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.166
Well, I guess that's why he's a chemist
and not a lawyer, huh?

27:39.875 --> 27:41.208
Landor owns it all.

27:41.291 --> 27:43.791
And, well, I just bought Landor,
so now I own it.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.666
Hell, I even own Metzer.

27:45.750 --> 27:46.791
It's all done.

27:46.875 --> 27:49.250
And no, Rod, I didn't come to you because…

27:50.250 --> 27:52.708
Well, who exactly are you
in this equation?

27:52.791 --> 27:55.375
What did you think was going to happen?
I'm curious.

27:55.458 --> 28:00.291
You were gonna walk in here,
talk a little and then we would, what?

28:01.041 --> 28:02.250
Partner up?

28:02.333 --> 28:04.666
You go from mail room to the boardroom?

28:04.750 --> 28:07.708
And I'd turn to you and say,
"Hey, Rod, what do we do next?"

28:09.125 --> 28:11.541
Come on, man. You're smarter than that.

28:12.458 --> 28:15.625
You couldn't do what I did.
You couldn't buy Landor.

28:15.708 --> 28:17.791
You couldn't lock down Metzer.

28:17.875 --> 28:19.750
You can't lock down Ligodone.

28:19.833 --> 28:25.458
You can't do anything
because you don't have any juice.

28:28.500 --> 28:30.416
Yet. And that's not your fault.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.041
The whole thing was all my idea.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.916
No, no. An idea is nothing.

28:35.000 --> 28:37.666
An idea is a fart that your brain makes.

28:39.416 --> 28:42.875
But if you patent an idea,
well, then it's an asset.

28:43.458 --> 28:44.375
Do you get it now?

28:46.250 --> 28:47.083
Okay, look.

28:48.875 --> 28:51.666
Here is something that you do have, okay?

28:51.750 --> 28:54.333
This is gonna sound like a little,
but it's not.

28:54.416 --> 28:58.000
You have, for the moment, my gratitude.

28:58.708 --> 29:00.916
And that can be an asset.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.375
Hell, that can even have a value.

29:04.458 --> 29:06.708
You see, because I'm writing you a check.

29:06.791 --> 29:12.208
In the amount of $500.

29:12.291 --> 29:16.416
I don't have to do this, okay,
I don't pay finder's fees for ideas.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.375
I don't pay for other people's farts.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.791
But you're a smart guy,
you're gonna take this money,

29:20.875 --> 29:23.083
you're gonna buy your wife something nice.

29:26.000 --> 29:26.916
Money for nothing.

29:27.666 --> 29:29.708
Money for words.

29:29.791 --> 29:31.291
Money for hot air.

29:31.375 --> 29:35.291
You walked in here, brain farted
and turned it into $500.

29:35.375 --> 29:39.750
And now, if you're smart, you're realizing
what else my gratitude is worth.

29:41.541 --> 29:44.250
You're realizing,
"Oh, this guy likes my ideas."

29:45.125 --> 29:48.041
A good manager wants to keep people
with good ideas around.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.333
Gratitude's worth more
than you thought, isn't it?

29:53.416 --> 29:57.208
And now you're thinking, "Is he grateful
enough to want to promote me?"

29:57.291 --> 29:59.875
And the answer is "yes."

30:00.500 --> 30:02.750
Because that guy with the good ideas,

30:03.666 --> 30:07.583
I'm gonna want a shorter elevator ride
between me, those ideas and that guy.

30:08.541 --> 30:12.125
Better to have him on the fourth floor
than Sub 2, maybe the 10th floor.

30:12.208 --> 30:14.458
It's a shorter ride to hear
those great ideas.

30:14.541 --> 30:17.708
Maybe, down the line,
I'm gonna want him up here.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.000
Down the hall from me.

30:20.083 --> 30:23.416
Hell, I might even want him
right next door to me.

30:24.625 --> 30:28.083
You seeing the big picture here?
Do you get me, Roderick?

30:31.166 --> 30:32.125
I get you.

30:32.208 --> 30:34.958
Okay, good. So maybe if you curb
the fucking attitude,

30:35.041 --> 30:37.083
you shut your mouth
and you listen for a minute,

30:37.166 --> 30:39.625
you will figure out
that you have an angle here.

30:39.708 --> 30:43.041
An angle that takes you closer
to where you wanna go.

30:44.666 --> 30:47.750
Or do you wanna yell at me more
and find yourself out on the street?

30:54.375 --> 30:55.208
There you go.

30:56.375 --> 30:58.083
See, I knew you were a smart guy.

31:00.416 --> 31:01.666
[sighs]

31:02.458 --> 31:06.250
Now, let's talk about
your future here at Fortunato, hmm?

31:06.916 --> 31:09.500

-[Roderick] What are you talking about?

31:24.125 --> 31:26.625
I'm celebrating.

31:26.708 --> 31:27.541
[Madeline] Mmm.

31:28.208 --> 31:29.083
What did you get?

31:29.875 --> 31:31.291
[Roderick] 15% pay raise,

31:31.375 --> 31:35.416
I'm on four now and $500 on top.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.666
Five hundred dollars right now.

31:37.750 --> 31:39.333
-It is huge for us.
-Yeah.

31:39.416 --> 31:41.375
[Annabel] This is a good thing, Roddie.

31:42.083 --> 31:44.666
Remember when we first got placed
with the Muldoons?

31:46.708 --> 31:49.041
They were our first fosters
after Mom died.

31:49.125 --> 31:52.833
Awful people. Had five foster kids,
five support checks coming in.

31:52.916 --> 31:55.083
They were making money off the gig.

31:55.166 --> 31:57.875
Stuffed us all into a tiny room,
rationed out our food,

31:57.958 --> 32:00.458
cashed the checks
and kept most of it themselves.

32:00.541 --> 32:03.500
Roderick was defiant.

32:03.583 --> 32:04.916
Called them out.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
Raised holy hell. Came right at them.

32:08.125 --> 32:08.958
Charged.

32:10.833 --> 32:11.833
What did it get you?

32:12.958 --> 32:15.041
Locked in the closet mostly.

32:15.125 --> 32:16.000
[Madeline] Right.

32:16.583 --> 32:18.958
I went a different way.

32:20.375 --> 32:23.791
-You kissed ass.
-I made myself their favorite.

32:24.666 --> 32:25.583
Of all the kids.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.625
Kept telling Mrs. Muldoon
how hard she had it.

32:28.708 --> 32:30.083
"I don't know how you do it all."

32:30.166 --> 32:33.208
Even suggested ways
that she could cut more corners,

32:33.291 --> 32:35.458
keep more of those support checks.

32:36.000 --> 32:36.833
And it worked.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.875
She started to see me as a helper.

32:40.958 --> 32:44.666
She gave me more responsibility. And more.

32:45.625 --> 32:49.416
And pretty soon she didn't even cover
that ledger when I came into the room.

32:50.666 --> 32:51.666
Then what happened?

32:52.666 --> 32:53.666
Social services.

32:53.750 --> 32:54.583
Broke it all up.

32:56.625 --> 32:57.541
Right?

32:57.625 --> 33:00.583
When I decided it was time.

33:03.083 --> 33:05.750
She didn't know it was me
until they had her in cuffs.

33:08.333 --> 33:10.375
You always charge right at it.

33:12.041 --> 33:14.666
And I will always love you for that.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.958
Rufus Griswold is just Mrs. Muldoon
in a nice suit.

33:19.791 --> 33:24.291
You charge him, you're in the closet,
and he will brick you in there too.

33:24.375 --> 33:27.041
And the more you fight,
the more bricks he'll add

33:27.125 --> 33:29.250
until you're in your own tiny little tomb.

33:30.250 --> 33:31.916
But you're smarter than that now.

33:34.041 --> 33:35.666
You don't run right at him.

33:37.541 --> 33:39.541
You get beside him.

33:39.625 --> 33:42.583
You make him want to hand you that trowel.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.083
Show you how it works.

33:47.916 --> 33:50.791
Then you stab him with it.

33:54.375 --> 33:56.833
[Annabel] We can get Tammy's medicine now.

33:58.458 --> 34:01.250
It's been three months
we couldn't afford that medicine.

34:01.333 --> 34:03.291
Now we can. That's great.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.500
It's so great.

34:05.750 --> 34:08.625
And we can fix the air conditioner too.
You did that.

34:09.458 --> 34:10.791
[Roderick] I know. I know.

34:18.375 --> 34:21.333
I know your sister had it hard.

34:22.666 --> 34:24.000
You both had it hard.

34:24.083 --> 34:28.291
You had to be so hard. Both of you.

34:28.375 --> 34:30.541
So young.
And I will never understand that.

34:31.416 --> 34:32.958
I won't. I can't, but…

34:35.958 --> 34:37.333
I don't like her, honey.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.375
I'm sorry, I don't.

in the footage except her.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.625
How many people interacted
with this woman?

37:36.708 --> 37:40.333
[Arthur] That's tough to say.
Wait staff all say the same thing.

37:40.416 --> 37:44.125
They didn't see her face.
Red cloak, killer body, that's it.

37:44.208 --> 37:47.416
It looks like maybe… maybe
she tipped them off.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.208
-Maybe.
-[Arthur] They're not sure.

37:49.291 --> 37:52.708
They feel like maybe she said something
but they can't remember what.

37:52.791 --> 37:54.458
Just felt they needed to get out.

37:54.541 --> 37:57.916
[Madeline] I don't like it. I mean,
who does this? What's the point?

37:58.000 --> 38:01.083
And why don't they reach out
and ask for something?

38:01.166 --> 38:02.916
Press the wait staff again.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.458
See if anybody made any big deposits.

38:05.541 --> 38:08.958
Bought fancy shoes, anything at all
in the past few weeks.

38:09.041 --> 38:12.583
Maybe you're right, Roddie.
Maybe it was just a horrible accident.

38:12.666 --> 38:16.125
But you keep one foot
in both possibilities, Arthur.

38:16.208 --> 38:17.125
You got it.

38:17.208 --> 38:20.333
We'll know more when Morrie wakes up.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.458
Good morning?

38:31.041 --> 38:33.000
-Afternoon?
-[Leo] Oh, who can say?

38:33.750 --> 38:34.583
Hey.

38:35.333 --> 38:36.166
I made you eggs.

38:37.125 --> 38:38.916
That's amazing.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.333
I'm shocked you're on your feet,

38:41.416 --> 38:43.791
I thought you wouldn't be conscious
until tomorrow.

38:45.333 --> 38:46.541
Did you clean?

38:46.625 --> 38:48.291
-You know, I did.
-[cell phone dings]

38:48.375 --> 38:50.916
[Leo] I don't know.
Grief's a funny thing, I guess.

38:51.000 --> 38:51.916
Keith just texted.

38:54.458 --> 38:57.166
Apparently Liam was a mess
when he got home last night.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.458
[chuckling]

38:59.541 --> 39:00.666
Yeah, it was…

39:02.833 --> 39:06.833
Actually I… I don't remember.
How… How was it, actually?

39:07.791 --> 39:10.500
It was whatever you think it was.
It was that and more.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.041
I'm glad you don't remember.

39:13.125 --> 39:16.000
It's a… blessing anyway.

39:17.875 --> 39:18.708
Why?

39:19.291 --> 39:20.125
What was I like?

39:20.833 --> 39:21.666
You were gone.

39:21.750 --> 39:26.000
Yeah, but anything… I don't know,
anything out of the ordinary? Anything…

39:26.083 --> 39:27.083
I'm not saying that.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.416
Yeah, fuck.

39:32.333 --> 39:36.291
I, uh, I cannot remember a fucking thing
after Camille left.

39:36.375 --> 39:37.750
Nothing jumps out at you?

39:37.833 --> 39:38.833
Hey, where's Pluto?

39:41.000 --> 39:41.833
I don't know.

39:42.833 --> 39:44.666
I put her food bowl out, see.

39:45.291 --> 39:47.208
I put it out as soon as I woke up.

39:47.291 --> 39:48.666
And I haven't heard…

39:49.708 --> 39:51.625
Fuck, did we let her out by mistake?

39:52.416 --> 39:55.500
Oh, fuck. Not again. [sighs]

39:56.833 --> 39:59.291
Hey, she always comes back.

40:00.291 --> 40:02.500
-[sighs]
-I mean, what was it like last time?

40:02.583 --> 40:03.750
Three days.

40:05.166 --> 40:08.125
[nurse] She's still unconscious.
Checked on her an hour ago.

40:08.208 --> 40:09.750
She's stable, but nothing yet.

40:09.833 --> 40:11.875
I understand. Um…

40:13.833 --> 40:18.125
I'd still… I'd love to see her
if that's okay.

40:33.791 --> 40:35.791
[ECG beeping]

40:39.250 --> 40:40.083
Mom?

40:41.625 --> 40:43.875
[Morrie wheezing]

40:43.958 --> 40:46.875
Mom! It's okay. I'm here. Mom?

40:46.958 --> 40:49.458
-[beeping rapidly]
-[Morrie continues wheezing]

40:49.541 --> 40:52.333
Mom! Mom, don't do that!

40:52.416 --> 40:53.416
-[phone beeps]
-Hey, um…

40:53.500 --> 40:55.166
My Mom's awake but she's freaking out!

40:55.250 --> 40:57.583
[shouting] Ma! Don't do that! Ma!

40:58.583 --> 41:00.416
Hurry up! Mom!

41:00.500 --> 41:01.833
[Morrie wheezing]

41:02.666 --> 41:04.916
[both scream]

41:06.291 --> 41:08.291
[line ringing]

41:09.375 --> 41:10.791
[Victorine] Hi, is this Pam?

41:11.750 --> 41:14.166
Hi there, this is, uh…
It's Victorine Lafourcade.

41:14.708 --> 41:16.458
We met yesterday at the clinic, I--

41:17.625 --> 41:18.500
[chuckling] Yeah.

41:19.333 --> 41:21.666
Yes, that's right. That's right.

41:23.416 --> 41:27.500
So, um, listen, the doctor and I,
we reviewed your file

41:27.583 --> 41:31.041
and, um, well, I recall you talking
about your irregular heartbeat.

41:32.291 --> 41:33.125
Mmm.

41:34.333 --> 41:38.208
Well, we're just about to start trials
on a very, very exciting new treatment,

41:38.291 --> 41:39.500
a new device,

41:39.583 --> 41:43.166
that I think you would just make
a wonderful candidate for.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.041
Well, that is if you're interested.

41:49.500 --> 41:52.666
You're late. And I'm hoping you got
that hookup on Vic,

41:52.750 --> 41:55.916
but we can talk about it after
because I've had a shit day

41:56.000 --> 41:58.750
and I really just wanna starfish
and forget the world.

42:00.083 --> 42:02.666
-You two have your work cut out for you.
-Camille.

42:02.750 --> 42:05.208
Don't talk to me until I've come
at least twice.

42:06.666 --> 42:07.833
[groans softly] Fuck.

42:08.458 --> 42:09.750
It's okay, you got this.

42:11.708 --> 42:15.958
With all respect, that part of this
is not happening anymore.

42:16.750 --> 42:18.083
Oh, I've got to hear this.

42:21.291 --> 42:22.333
Oh, my God.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.250
You fucking children.

42:24.791 --> 42:25.875
It just happened.

42:25.958 --> 42:26.916
Don't minimize it.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.583
-We're together now and it's serious.
-For the love of fuck's sake.

42:30.666 --> 42:32.666
-This dynamic is grossly inappropriate…
-Tina.

42:32.750 --> 42:35.416
And we've been trying to figure out
a way to tell you,

42:35.500 --> 42:37.625
but we feared repercussions,
which is not cool.

42:37.708 --> 42:38.541
Don't say it.

42:39.458 --> 42:40.333
You're in love.

42:42.583 --> 42:43.416
Yeah.

42:43.500 --> 42:45.291
Oh, God, my fucking day.

42:45.375 --> 42:50.125
Okay, so you both signed NDAs,
which are, I mean they're phenomenal,

42:50.208 --> 42:51.833
you should just read them again,

42:51.916 --> 42:55.000
and you've both also, you'll recall,
signed consent forms. So…

42:55.083 --> 42:57.208
We thought that was weird at the time too.

42:57.291 --> 42:59.875
You thought that was weird?
I'm not a fucking idiot.

42:59.958 --> 43:02.625
And, like I told you, both of you
when you were hired,

43:04.166 --> 43:09.291
[slowly] I require a lot of my assistants.

43:09.375 --> 43:10.708
We're really sorry.

43:10.791 --> 43:13.750
This is a full service position.

43:14.500 --> 43:16.166
I don't have… I have… Okay.

43:16.250 --> 43:19.750
I have specific needs.
I have specific requirements

43:19.833 --> 43:23.416
for a very specific
and unique fucking lifestyle.

43:23.500 --> 43:26.083
I think it's really convenient
that you two were excited

43:26.166 --> 43:28.291
when you signed your NDAs
and consent forms

43:28.375 --> 43:30.375
and that you two fell in love, Tina,

43:30.458 --> 43:33.916
one month after I finish paying
off your student debt, Tina?

43:34.000 --> 43:35.750
My name isn't Tina, it's Beth.

43:35.833 --> 43:37.750
I don't give a shit, Beth!

43:37.833 --> 43:42.083
Damn it, Toby and fucking Tina
makes me laugh,

43:42.166 --> 43:45.500
so at work you're fucking Tina!

43:46.166 --> 43:47.833
Why is that so-- Ow.

43:47.916 --> 43:49.250
I have a fucking migraine.

43:52.958 --> 43:55.875
Fine, okay, oh, okay, you're in love.
You're in love.

43:56.791 --> 43:58.250
Adorable little morons.

43:58.333 --> 44:01.916
You would think that spending
this much time around Fortunato Industries

44:02.000 --> 44:04.958
would teach the two of you a little bit
about brain chemistry,

44:05.041 --> 44:07.416
you dopamine-riddled little fuck puppets.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.625
I'm just gonna Venmo you
your severance.

44:09.708 --> 44:11.875
We're not quitting.
We just needed you to know.

44:11.958 --> 44:16.000
No, you're not quitting. You're fired
because you're all but useless to me now,

44:16.083 --> 44:17.958
if you can't perform your designated tasks

44:18.041 --> 44:21.208
and I will not be able to fuck
either of you from here on out

44:21.291 --> 44:24.000
-without laughing so, boom, we're done.
-[phone beeps]

44:24.083 --> 44:26.250
[groans] When the norepinephrine wears off

44:26.333 --> 44:28.333
and you are lying in bed
next to each other

44:28.416 --> 44:31.583
and one of you lets out a long fart
in your sleep,

44:32.625 --> 44:34.500
you're gonna look back at this moment

44:34.583 --> 44:38.125
and realize what a stupid,
fucking decision you both just made.

44:42.666 --> 44:44.625
Did you at least get the hookup on Vic?

44:47.916 --> 44:48.750
For real?

44:52.666 --> 44:53.833
[keys jangle]

44:53.916 --> 44:55.375
[Toby] Deal with it yourself.

44:55.458 --> 44:58.125
[door opens and closes]

44:58.833 --> 45:00.041
[Tammy] She's late.

45:00.625 --> 45:01.583
[Bill] It's okay.

45:01.666 --> 45:02.916
It's unprofessional.

45:03.541 --> 45:05.625
It wouldn't be the end of the world
if she flaked.

45:06.291 --> 45:08.541
You've been through a lot,
whether you admit it or not.

45:08.625 --> 45:10.250
[doorbell rings]

45:10.750 --> 45:11.958
[Tammy] You're late.

45:12.041 --> 45:13.458
-[Verna] Mmm.
-Where's Lauren?

45:13.541 --> 45:16.375
She's under the weather,
didn't want to spread it around.

45:16.458 --> 45:19.666
But don't worry, huh,
we work together all the time.

45:19.750 --> 45:22.666
She filled me in on everything,
so I understand the gig.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.333
I'm Candy.

45:25.166 --> 45:26.041
You're Candy?

45:27.041 --> 45:30.000
Darling, I'm whoever you want.

45:30.708 --> 45:31.541
[door closes]

45:33.250 --> 45:35.291
-[Bill] Oh.
-[Verna chuckles]

45:35.375 --> 45:37.125
Lauren is under the weather.

45:37.208 --> 45:38.041
Oh.

45:40.500 --> 45:43.416
Okay, uh, you good? Or…

45:43.500 --> 45:45.166
[Tammy] I'm good. This works.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.708
Okay. Hi, I'm Bill.

45:47.791 --> 45:48.791
[Verna] Brilliant.

45:49.541 --> 45:52.875
And, uh, we're having dinner to start?

45:52.958 --> 45:54.291
There, uh… There you go.

45:54.375 --> 45:55.583
[Verna chuckles softly]

45:55.666 --> 45:56.500
Thanks awfully.

45:58.791 --> 46:01.166
[sighs] You know…

46:02.166 --> 46:04.958
[inhales] It smells terrific.

46:08.583 --> 46:09.666
[exhales]

46:09.750 --> 46:11.208
And I was craving that today.

46:12.625 --> 46:15.333
I almost texted you
when I left the office.

46:15.416 --> 46:19.250
I almost texted to ask
if you'd do your chicken piccata.

46:20.625 --> 46:21.625
It's like you knew.

46:22.208 --> 46:23.041
Ugh.

46:23.875 --> 46:24.708
I just love you.

46:30.833 --> 46:34.333
Yeah, well, I knew you had a bad day
so you deserve it.

46:35.125 --> 46:36.500
Uh, tell me about your day.

46:36.583 --> 46:37.875
[Verna] Today was something.

46:37.958 --> 46:42.083
And I don't know how to talk about it.
I'm… I don't know how to feel.

46:42.625 --> 46:45.041
This fucked up tragedy and…

46:46.208 --> 46:48.000
I'm not sure how to feel about it.

46:48.541 --> 46:49.416
So you know what?

46:49.500 --> 46:50.375
[sighs]

46:52.125 --> 46:57.125
Let's not talk about Perry or the family,
or anything else.

46:59.958 --> 47:00.791
Not tonight.

47:04.500 --> 47:06.333
Tonight…

47:06.833 --> 47:09.416
I just wanna have dinner
with my husband.

47:10.208 --> 47:12.666
I just wanna feel seen

47:13.625 --> 47:17.041
and do whatever we can to push
the rest of that away.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.166
[whispering] And relax. [chuckles]

47:21.000 --> 47:22.625
[in normal voice] And who knows?

47:24.041 --> 47:25.208
How was your day, Bill?

47:26.041 --> 47:27.041
[chuckles]

47:28.375 --> 47:29.666
My day? Uh…

47:31.916 --> 47:33.500
It was okay, truth be told.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.666
We finished two new videos, two episodes

47:37.750 --> 47:41.041
and honest to God, I think
we finally found our music supervisor.

47:41.833 --> 47:44.375
And it is making all the difference.

47:44.458 --> 47:45.458
[Verna] Yeah.

47:46.500 --> 47:49.458
[Bill] I think it's going to be great
for Goldbug, actually.

47:51.333 --> 47:54.000
I have some ideas about the launch,
if you wanna hear them?

47:54.083 --> 47:54.916
[Verna] Mmm.

47:55.750 --> 47:57.125
Tell me all about it, love.

48:10.166 --> 48:11.166
[car beeps]

48:31.875 --> 48:32.791
Excuse me.

48:33.791 --> 48:36.375
-This is a restricted area.
-[Camille] Yes, I know.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.208
You must be new.

48:42.291 --> 48:43.708
You shouldn't be here.

48:44.875 --> 48:46.458
Roderick Usher is my father.

48:46.541 --> 48:47.625
[Verna] I understand.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.666
Shouldn't be here though.

48:51.833 --> 48:53.458
[whispering] Oh, my God, my day.

48:53.541 --> 48:54.958
What's your name?

48:55.041 --> 48:56.166
Fuck it, I don't care.

48:56.250 --> 48:59.625
Listen, security guard person,
I don't know if you've read the news,

48:59.708 --> 49:02.208
but it's been a very difficult week
for the Usher family,

49:02.291 --> 49:04.625
and we're doing an article
on my sister's work.

49:04.708 --> 49:07.875
You know my sister. Victorine Lafourcade.

49:08.500 --> 49:09.958
I know Miss Lafourcade.

49:10.541 --> 49:12.000
And you work the night shift.

49:12.583 --> 49:15.791
Which means that you know what she does
to those poor animals.

49:15.875 --> 49:17.458
And also, she greases your palm

49:17.541 --> 49:20.916
as she walks by with her drippy Birkin bag
full of monkey bits.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.541
And so, unless you'd like me
to audit your deposits

49:23.625 --> 49:26.166
and hold it up against
your predictably humble salary,

49:26.250 --> 49:29.333
you're gonna do the smart thing
and go back to your crossword puzzle

49:29.416 --> 49:31.791
or else I'll have you fired and sued.

49:31.875 --> 49:34.291
What's a six-letter word for "fucked"?

49:35.958 --> 49:37.041
Fucked.

49:38.416 --> 49:40.000
But you shouldn't be here.

49:40.083 --> 49:41.291
I know who you are.

49:42.041 --> 49:43.500
Of course I know who you are.

49:44.291 --> 49:45.416
You're the clever one.

49:47.500 --> 49:48.833
But you shouldn't be here.

49:49.375 --> 49:50.875
And you don't have to be here.

49:52.291 --> 49:53.500
That's all I was saying.

49:59.333 --> 50:00.166
Open the door.

50:08.375 --> 50:09.333
[door beeps]

50:24.083 --> 50:25.166
[door beeps]

50:30.750 --> 50:31.666
Oh.

50:33.583 --> 50:35.416
[monkeys chittering softly]

50:41.958 --> 50:43.083
[whimpering]

50:49.750 --> 50:50.750
Fuck!

50:52.916 --> 50:54.500
[grunting]

50:56.541 --> 50:57.958
[monkey screeching]

50:59.583 --> 51:01.791
Yeah, she pump you full of adrenaline?

51:03.166 --> 51:05.375
-Keep your little heart beating?
-[grunting]

51:05.458 --> 51:07.291
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[shrieks]

51:10.875 --> 51:13.250
Vic, Vic, Vic.

51:14.041 --> 51:16.041
[camera shutter clicking]

51:19.708 --> 51:21.166
[monkeys shrieking]

51:35.208 --> 51:36.750
[camera shutter clicks]

51:37.583 --> 51:41.291
Oh, Vic, you are so fucked.

51:41.375 --> 51:43.250
-[Verna] Why do you hate her?
-[gasps]

51:44.833 --> 51:46.000
What the fuck?

51:46.083 --> 51:48.666
[Verna] You know, it was the Greeks
who started it.

51:48.750 --> 51:50.750
Fourth century BCE.

51:50.833 --> 51:52.708
First experiments on animals.

51:52.791 --> 51:54.500
At least, documented.

51:54.583 --> 51:56.333
Pigs and goats.

51:56.416 --> 51:59.291
You know how many animals are used
for testing in a year?

52:00.458 --> 52:02.125
More than a hundred million.

52:02.208 --> 52:05.416
Human beings doing this
to so many other species.

52:05.500 --> 52:06.375
It's impressive.

52:06.458 --> 52:12.083
Medical research on chimpanzees
was pretty much banned in 2015.

52:12.166 --> 52:15.041
I mean, they said exceptions could be made

52:15.708 --> 52:20.000
if the research was proven to be critical
to understanding human disease.

52:20.583 --> 52:23.250
And if a sizeable donation was made

52:23.875 --> 52:27.041
to support the conservation
of wild chimps.

52:29.916 --> 52:30.833
[chuckles softly]

52:30.916 --> 52:33.708
Your dad is a force of nature, isn't he?

52:35.333 --> 52:38.500
I'm gonna need you to tell me
who the fuck you think you are.

52:39.875 --> 52:40.875
Why do you hate her?

52:42.208 --> 52:46.833
I mean, on paper, you should be allies.
The bastard daughters of Roderick Usher.

52:47.750 --> 52:49.625
What an alliance you could have made.

52:50.250 --> 52:53.458
Okay, whoever you are,
you are so fucking fired.

52:53.541 --> 52:55.708
[shrieks]

52:55.791 --> 52:59.250
90% of drugs fail in human trials.

52:59.333 --> 53:03.458
Even though they pass pre-clinical tests.
So, sorry, animals.

53:03.541 --> 53:06.208
And what about the stuff
that has nothing to do with health?

53:06.291 --> 53:11.041
I mean, you lot can't make a lipstick
or a dandruff shampoo

53:11.125 --> 53:16.000
without making something suffer.

53:18.416 --> 53:24.166
I love how deliciously,
pointlessly mean you lot can be.

53:24.875 --> 53:26.791
Okay, fired is the wrong word.

53:26.875 --> 53:28.750
Because I'm gonna have you
fucking killed.

53:29.208 --> 53:30.666
[monkey shrieks]

53:32.541 --> 53:33.875
[Verna] And you could too.

53:35.166 --> 53:38.041
You picked the worst job
to hide your true nature.

53:39.041 --> 53:41.125
You clean up dirt for a living.

53:43.375 --> 53:45.375
[shrieking]

53:49.375 --> 53:52.166
Victorine, on the other hand…

53:54.208 --> 53:55.458
she picked better.

53:56.208 --> 53:58.541
She's Mother Teresa, far as they know.

53:58.625 --> 53:59.750
[chimpanzee shrieks]

53:59.833 --> 54:04.583
Saving humanity
one precious heart at a time.

54:05.208 --> 54:07.333
Inside though, you two are the most alike.

54:08.125 --> 54:10.208
[breathing heavily]

54:10.291 --> 54:14.208
You hate her because she hid it… better.

54:14.916 --> 54:17.166
[groaning]

54:20.125 --> 54:22.125
[groaning intensifies]

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
[screaming]

54:30.625 --> 54:32.625
[monkeys shrieking]

54:38.375 --> 54:40.916
[whimpering softly]

54:42.000 --> 54:43.708
You're right…

54:45.250 --> 54:46.083
you know.

54:47.625 --> 54:49.083
She lies.

54:52.625 --> 54:58.541
And she pumps us full of adrenaline
to make it look like it works.

55:04.458 --> 55:07.708
You still didn't need to come here though.

55:07.791 --> 55:09.375
It could have happened quiet.

55:09.458 --> 55:10.666
Peaceful.

55:10.750 --> 55:11.875
In bed.

55:11.958 --> 55:15.458
But I guess it's got to happen like this.

55:17.958 --> 55:18.791
I'm sorry.

55:20.583 --> 55:21.666
It's not personal.

55:22.500 --> 55:24.250
It wasn't with your brother either.

55:25.416 --> 55:27.500
It's just, well…

55:28.458 --> 55:31.041
[breathes deeply]

55:31.125 --> 55:32.458
Here we are.

55:39.125 --> 55:39.958
Fuck it.

55:41.833 --> 55:42.666
I got mine.

55:56.708 --> 55:58.208
That's weird, where's Phil?

56:04.458 --> 56:05.583
[door clicks]

56:08.083 --> 56:09.500
[monkeys chittering]

56:11.541 --> 56:12.666
Oh, my God.

56:29.125 --> 56:30.208
[monkey shrieks]

56:34.916 --> 56:36.916
[growling]

56:52.208 --> 56:54.208
[metallic rattling]

56:59.750 --> 57:01.750
[monkeys chittering]

57:04.000 --> 57:05.750
[grunting]

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
[panting]

57:23.041 --> 57:24.666
[chittering]

57:34.041 --> 57:36.291
[metallic squeaking]

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
[monkey grunting]

57:46.250 --> 57:48.125
[panting]

57:52.291 --> 57:53.958
[metal rattles]

58:05.416 --> 58:08.416
[chittering]

58:24.583 --> 58:26.583
[panting, grunting]
