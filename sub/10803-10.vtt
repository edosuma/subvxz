00:03.128 --> 00:06.338
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 4741 0.2.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.674
The Atrean government
has requested assistance

00:08.842 --> 00:10.926
in averting a natural disaster.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.970
Two of their geologists
have come aboard,

00:13.138 --> 00:17.016
one of whom is a human
who has been living on Atrea IV.

00:17.183 --> 00:18.684
Captain, the situation has worsened

00:18.852 --> 00:21.478
since my husband and I
first contacted you.

00:21.646 --> 00:25.065
The molten core of our planet
isn't just cooling,

00:25.233 --> 00:26.984
it's begun to solidify.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.445
TAINER: Our gravitational field
has been affected.

00:29.612 --> 00:32.614
Seismic activity has increased
by a factor of three.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.367
If the cooling continues at this rate,

00:35.535 --> 00:39.496
Atrea will become uninhabitable
in 1 3 months.

00:39.664 --> 00:43.625
We could minimize seismic activity
by creating isobaric fissures

00:43.793 --> 00:45.794
and relieving some
of the tectonic stress.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.796
But that would just be
a temporary fix.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.300
The only permanent solution
would be to reliquefy the core.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.219
These pockets in the magma layer,

00:54.387 --> 00:56.722
how close are they
to the molten region of the core?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.766
A few kilometers. Why?

00:59.267 --> 01:01.852
Data, you think that's close enough
for ferroplasmic infusion?

01:03.480 --> 01:05.898
The procedure will involve
using the ship's phasers

01:06.066 --> 01:09.818
to drill down through
the planet's surface into the pockets,

01:09.986 --> 01:12.780
where we would set up
a series of plasma-infusion units.

01:12.947 --> 01:15.657
We'll trigger the units
by firing modulated energy bursts

01:15.825 --> 01:17.076
down through the shafts.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.786
I see.

01:18.953 --> 01:24.374
Injecting plasma directly into the core
should trigger a chain reaction.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.960
And that will reliquefy the magma.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.379
It should be possible
to stabilize the core temperature

01:29.547 --> 01:31.423
at 93 percent of normal.

01:31.591 --> 01:35.219
If it works, the core
would remain molten for centuries.

01:35.386 --> 01:39.181
If you give your permission,
we could begin immediately.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.682
TAINER:
Very well.

01:40.850 --> 01:44.353
But before we proceed, I'd like
to update our geological surveys.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.106
Fine, I'd be very happy
to help you with that, doctor.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.274
We've assigned you quarters
during our time here.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.193
Please,
make yourselves comfortable.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.320
Thank you, captain.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.615
Data?

01:56.783 --> 01:58.575
Yes, doctor.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.371
Do you have any idea who l am?

02:02.872 --> 02:04.373
You are Dr. Juliana Tainer.

02:05.333 --> 02:09.128
Oh, you lost all your early memories.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.547
We thought you would,
but we couldn't be certain.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.590
Have we met before?

02:13.758 --> 02:16.385
Oh, Data, I was there,

02:16.553 --> 02:19.179
right at the beginning
on Omicron Theta.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.515
I helped create you.

02:21.683 --> 02:25.519
And now look at you.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.563
You were a colleague of Dr. Soong?

02:27.730 --> 02:31.441
Heh. I most certainly was.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.944
And I was also his wife.

02:34.362 --> 02:39.908
In a way, I suppose you could say
I am your mother.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.902
PICARD:
Space, the final frontier.

03:15.528 --> 03:19.489
These are the voyages
ofthe starship Enterprise.

03:19.657 --> 03:24.786
Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,

03:25.121 --> 03:29.249
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

03:29.667 --> 03:34.004
to boldly go where no one
has gone before.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.731
I just can't believe

04:34.899 --> 04:38.694
I'm seeing you like this again,
after all these years.

04:38.861 --> 04:40.529
Doctor, I have no memory of you.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.531
Oh, there's a reason for that.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.408
We wiped your processors

04:44.575 --> 04:47.035
after we finished refining
your programming.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.705
Why don't you tell me
what you do remember,

04:49.872 --> 04:51.915
and then I'll fill in the gaps?

04:52.083 --> 04:54.376
My memory record begins
when I was activated

04:54.544 --> 04:57.504
by the Starfleet officers
on the Omicron Theta outpost.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.549
Ah, after the attack
of the Crystalline entity.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.303
Yes. All of the inhabitants
of the colony were killed.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.221
However, I discovered
that my memory banks

05:06.389 --> 05:08.807
contained the contents
of their journals and logs.

05:09.350 --> 05:12.352
We hoped their experiences
would be useful.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.562
After your childhood,

05:13.730 --> 05:16.732
we figured you could use
all the help you could get.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.777
- My childhood?
- Oh, well, that's what l called it.

05:20.945 --> 05:23.613
Well, you were like a baby at first.

05:23.781 --> 05:27.617
A 1 00-kilogram baby, but still...

05:28.244 --> 05:33.915
You had trouble, um,
learning your motor skills,

05:34.083 --> 05:37.127
learning how to process
sensory information.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.504
And, of course,
Noonien was never satisfied.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.256
He kept tinkering,

05:41.424 --> 05:44.968
trying to make you
as human as possible.

05:46.387 --> 05:50.390
So you wiped my memory processors
after this childhood.

05:50.558 --> 05:51.600
Mm-hm.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.226
And then we deactivated you

05:53.394 --> 05:57.230
and programmed you
with the colonists' logs.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.443
We had planned to reactivate you,
but we never got the chance.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.112
That's when the Crystalline entity
attacked.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.615
We had to leave quickly.

06:07.283 --> 06:08.617
We wanted to take you with us,

06:08.785 --> 06:12.245
but there was only room for two
in the escape pod.

06:13.664 --> 06:18.210
Doctor, I have scanned
the journals of the colonists.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.713
There is only one Juliana
mentioned in them.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.632
Her last name was O'Donnell.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.634
That's me.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.471
But there was no mention
that my father was married to you.

06:30.139 --> 06:31.848
Because of my mother.

06:32.517 --> 06:35.644
Heh. She thought that Noonien
was an eccentric scientist

06:35.812 --> 06:38.313
who was far too old for me.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.981
We decided to marry secretly

06:40.149 --> 06:42.818
to give her a chance
to get used to our being together.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.946
We slipped away to Mavala lV
and got married there.

06:46.114 --> 06:52.494
Heh. A Klingon and a Corvallen trader
were our witnesses.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.579
It wasn't exactly the wedding
I'd hoped for,

06:54.747 --> 06:58.250
but, ha, ha, somehow,
Noonien had a way

06:58.418 --> 07:02.045
of making even the oddest things
seem romantic.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.007
My father did have an unusual way
of looking at things.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.884
Well, how would you know that?

07:08.052 --> 07:10.679
I encountered him once
in the Terlina system.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.015
Why, that's where we went to
after we left the outpost.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.309
I had no idea
that you'd even met him.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.104
It was shortly before his death.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.192
He's dead?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.362
Yes.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.407
[GASPS

07:30.575 --> 07:34.161
I had no idea
it would hit me this hard.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.664
We didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.749
What do you mean?

07:43.045 --> 07:47.799
Oh, I realized he loved his work
as much as he loved me.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.594
Maybe more.

07:50.761 --> 07:53.472
Oh, there we were,
stuck out on this planet

07:53.639 --> 07:56.850
in the middle of the jungle
with no one else to talk to.

07:57.935 --> 08:02.272
No...life.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.487
It just wasn't enough.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.740
That's why l left.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.578
That was all
a very, very long time ago.

08:17.246 --> 08:21.791
The important thing
is that we're here now together.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.085
And I do want to get to know you.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.881
This has been
an interesting encounter.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.302
And an altogether unexpected one.

08:32.470 --> 08:36.139
I would like to corroborate your story
before we proceed further.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.225
Excuse me, doctor.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.946
Data, I'm almost finished
reconfiguring the phaser banks.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.240
We should be able to start drilling
in about an hour.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.742
Inform me when you are ready.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.370
What is it you're doing over there?

08:58.538 --> 09:02.791
I am attempting to ascertain
whether Dr. Tainer's story is true.

09:03.125 --> 09:04.626
Don't you believe her?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.336
I neither believe nor doubt.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.673
I am simply trying
to verify her assertions.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.968
Well, what have you
turned up so far?

09:13.135 --> 09:14.719
The registrar's office on Mavala IV

09:14.887 --> 09:17.681
cannot confirm whether Dr. Soong
was married there.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.516
Apparently,
many of the documents were lost

09:19.684 --> 09:21.351
when the government
was overthrown.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.144
What's that you're looking at?

09:23.312 --> 09:25.188
I'm checking passenger manifests

09:25.356 --> 09:28.483
to see if they went to Mavala IV
during the period in question.

09:30.361 --> 09:33.655
"O'Donnell, Juliana.

09:34.156 --> 09:36.825
Soong, Noonien."

09:37.201 --> 09:39.077
They were both passengers
on a transport

09:39.245 --> 09:43.665
which traveled from Omicron Theta
to Mavala and returned four days later.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.251
That sure fits with her story.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.088
Still, the fact
that they went to Mavala

09:50.256 --> 09:52.591
does not prove
they were married there.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.843
[LA FORGE CHUCKLES

09:55.011 --> 09:57.178
You know, Data,
it almost seems to me

09:57.346 --> 10:00.640
like you're trying to prove
that Dr. Tainer wasn't telling the truth.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.183
DATA:
Not at all.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.769
I am merely unable
to reconcile her story

10:04.937 --> 10:07.230
with the fact that my father
never mentioned her to me.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.441
Well, she did leave him.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.693
Maybe she broke his heart.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.487
Maybe he just didn't wanna talk
about her.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.697
Let me ask you this:

10:15.865 --> 10:19.826
Dr. Soong created
an emotion chip for you,

10:19.994 --> 10:22.996
and didn't Lore tell you that that chip
also contained memories?

10:23.164 --> 10:24.956
Memories Soong
wanted you to have?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.250
Yes.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.629
It is possible that those are memories
of my childhood.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.130
And of Mrs. Soong.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.467
The more you think about it,
why would she wanna lie?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.927
Why would anybody want to pretend
to be your mother?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.723
I can think of no motive
for such a pretense.

10:42.892 --> 10:43.933
And I can understand

10:44.101 --> 10:46.728
that this might all be
a little disconcerting for you, Data.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.980

into your logical processors.

how to deal with the unexpected.

into your preconceptions.

to accept the possibility of a past

are somewhat unstable.

the density of the rock layers

of the particle beam as we go.

will have nothing but goodness
in his heart.
