WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:04.704
- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING: NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.738 --> 00:08.141
- WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT A $180 MILLION SELLOUT.

00:08.174 --> 00:10.710
THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST THING

00:10.744 --> 00:11.845
OF MY ENTIRE CAREER.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.680
WHO SELLS $100 MILLION
IN TWO WEEKS?

00:13.713 --> 00:16.016
- US.
- HEY, SAM, GOOD NEWS.

00:16.049 --> 00:17.851
THEY CAME UP TO 6 MILLION.

00:17.884 --> 00:21.521
THAT'S A GOOD SOLID OFFER.

00:22.555 --> 00:23.723
[bleep]!

00:23.757 --> 00:25.759
- THE TIMING IS UP.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.193
THAT'S IT.

00:27.227 --> 00:30.330
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

00:30.363 --> 00:33.500
[upbeat music]

00:33.533 --> 00:35.669
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:35.702 --> 00:38.705
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:38.738 --> 00:42.042
- NEW YORK CITY IS THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:42.075 --> 00:43.743
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.512
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.048
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:48.081 --> 00:49.883
WAH!
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.

00:49.916 --> 00:50.884
- REACH HIGH.

00:50.917 --> 00:51.951
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE?

00:51.985 --> 00:53.019
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

00:53.053 --> 00:54.254
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.
- WHAT?

00:54.287 --> 00:55.588
- YOU WANNA CONTROL ME.

00:55.622 --> 00:59.559
* *

01:04.664 --> 01:07.534
- FERNANDO, CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO 101 WARREN?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.502
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

01:09.536 --> 01:10.570
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.373
- TRIBECA IS A GOOD FRIEND
OF MINE.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.076
I KNOW EVERY STONE,
EVERY BUILDING.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.877
LITERALLY EVERY APARTMENT.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.747
WHENEVER I GO TO HER,

01:20.780 --> 01:21.781
SHE HUGS ME

01:21.815 --> 01:24.984
AND USUALLY GIVES ME A CHECK.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.353
CHA-CHING.

01:27.954 --> 01:30.223
[knock at door]

01:32.659 --> 01:33.760
HI.
- FREDRIK.

01:33.793 --> 01:34.928
- YES.
YOUR NAME IS?

01:34.961 --> 01:36.363
- ZEKE.
- ZEK.

01:36.396 --> 01:37.664
- WELCOME.
- ZEKI?

01:37.697 --> 01:39.366
- ZEKE.
- ZEKE. ZEKI?

01:39.399 --> 01:40.533
- ZEKE.
- ZEKI.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.335
- OKAY.
- JOHN, THE SELLER,

01:42.369 --> 01:44.537
HAS MOVED TO KANSAS CITY,
SO TODAY I'M MEETING

01:44.571 --> 01:46.339
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW
AND BUSINESS PARTNER

01:46.373 --> 01:48.008
ZEKI.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.943
HOLY...

01:49.976 --> 01:51.945
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A WHILE.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.747
I'VE SEEN A LOT
OF APARTMENTS.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.582
THIS--WHOA.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.722
OH, MY GOSH.
- NOT BAD, HUH?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.257
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.592
[chuckles maniacally]

02:05.625 --> 02:07.560
- A 30-FOOT HIGH CEILING
ON A TERRACE.

02:07.594 --> 02:10.397
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

02:10.430 --> 02:15.068
- OKAY, LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.
I CANNOT WAIT.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.837
THE FURNITURE IS BEAUTIFUL.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.573
ABSOLUTE PERFECTION.

02:24.711 --> 02:26.946
THE PENTHOUSE
AT 101 WARREN IS ONE

02:26.980 --> 02:28.715
OF THE MOST VISUALLY STUNNING
APARTMENTS

02:28.748 --> 02:30.517
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.452
OKAY, THE APARTMENT
IS BEAUTIFUL.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.587
ACTUALLY,
BEAUTIFUL IS THE WRONG WORD.

02:34.621 --> 02:36.089
THE RIGHT WORD IS PERFECT.
- THANK YOU.

02:36.122 --> 02:40.126
- NOW THINKING MAYBE A BUYER
WOULD WANT TO BUY IT LIKE THIS,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.695
ALL THE FURNITURE INCLUDED.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.264
- WE WOULD LOVE TO SELL IT
COMPLETE, CERTAINLY.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.632
- FIRST, I WANT TO SELL
THE APARTMENT,

02:45.665 --> 02:47.967
GET THE CONTRACT EXECUTED,
DONE, DONE, DONE, DONE.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.805
THEN SEPARATE AGREEMENT
FOR THE FURNISHINGS,

02:51.838 --> 02:55.275
BECAUSE THE LAST THING I NEED
IS A BIG FIGHT OVER A CHAIR.

02:55.308 --> 02:56.509
- THAT WORKS FOR ME.

02:56.543 --> 02:57.510
- I REALLY DON'T WANT

02:57.544 --> 02:58.645
TO COMPLICATE THINGS HERE.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.680
I WANT TO DEVISE TWO CONTRACTS--

03:00.714 --> 03:03.416
ONE CONTRACT
FOR THE APARTMENT ALONE

03:03.450 --> 03:04.718
AND A SECOND CONTRACT

03:04.751 --> 03:06.786
ONLY FOR THE FURNISHINGS.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.822
UM, ZEKI,

03:08.855 --> 03:11.925
I THINK YOU CAN GET A REALLY
HIGH PRICE PER SQUARE FOOT.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.059
- SO WHAT'S THAT NUMBER
FOR YOU?

03:13.093 --> 03:16.296
- I'M THINKING
LIKE $3,400 A FOOT.

03:16.329 --> 03:18.832
- 10 1/2 MILLION.
- YEAH.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.434
- WE WERE THINKING 11 MILLION.

03:21.468 --> 03:23.236
11 MILLION IS WHERE WE WERE.
SO WE'RE CLOSE.

03:23.269 --> 03:27.607
- YOU THINK THIS APARTMENT
IS WORTH ALMOST 3,500 A FOOT.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.743
YOU KNOW THAT'D BE A RECORD
FOR THE BUILDING?

03:29.776 --> 03:31.077
- YEAH, BUT,
YOU KNOW, I THINK,

03:31.077 --> 03:32.879
WITH WHAT YOU DID
ON NORTH MOORE,

03:32.912 --> 03:34.214
I THINK YOU CAN SELL IT
FOR THAT.

03:34.247 --> 03:37.083
- THE AVERAGE PRICE PER SQUARE
FOOT IN 101 WARREN

03:37.083 --> 03:39.252
IS 2,100 A FOOT.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.354
AT 10.5 MILLION,
IT'S A CRAZY RECORD.

03:41.388 --> 03:45.191
AT 11 MILLION...
[hisses]

03:45.225 --> 03:46.326
- IF WE LIST IT AT 11 MILLION,

03:46.359 --> 03:48.428
PLUS THE FURNITURE
AND THE AMENITIES

03:48.461 --> 03:49.996
ON TOP OF THAT--
- SEPARATE.

03:50.096 --> 03:50.997
- SEPARATE.
THAT WOULD MAKE US HAPPY.

03:51.097 --> 03:52.599
- WELL, I WANT
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.300
I ALWAYS SET RECORDS.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.136
CLIENTS HEAR
ABOUT THE RECORDS,

03:56.169 --> 03:59.305
THEY CALL ME, AND THEY WANT ME
TO SET YET ANOTHER RECORD.

03:59.339 --> 04:01.074
IT'S NOT EASY
BEING FREDRIK.

04:01.107 --> 04:02.709
OKAY.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.910
11 MILLION.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.278
AND YOUR TIMEFRAME?

04:05.311 --> 04:06.446
- RIGHT AWAY.
LET'S DO IT.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.648
- OKAY. EXCELLENT.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.283
- BYE, FREDRIKI.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.857
- I NEVER GET TIRED
OF PUSHING MYSELF.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.726
A LOT OF BROKERS,
THEY GET VERY LAZY,

04:19.759 --> 04:22.529
AND THEY STOP DOING
WHAT IS SO ESSENTIAL

04:22.562 --> 04:24.264
FOR THIS BUSINESS,
WHICH IS COLD CALLING.

04:24.297 --> 04:25.965
AND I STILL DO IT.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.501
PROVEN POINT--TODAY I AM MEETING
WITH A SELLER

04:28.535 --> 04:29.969
THAT I FOUND
BY COLD CALLING

04:30.070 --> 04:31.304
A LIST OF SELLERS
THAT WERE SELLING

04:31.338 --> 04:33.073
THEIR APARTMENTS ON THEIR OWN.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.341
BOOM.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.776
THIS APARTMENT IS LOCATED
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE

04:36.810 --> 04:38.712
ON 88TH STREET
BETWEEN AMSTERDAM AND BROADWAY.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.715
IT'S AN AREA WITH A LOT
OF RESIDENTIAL APARTMENTS.

04:41.748 --> 04:42.982
THERE'S A LOT OF VERY
INDEPENDENT LITTLE RESTAURANTS.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.085
AND AS MUCH RESIDENTIAL
AS THERE IS,

04:45.085 --> 04:47.620
THERE IS NO INVENTORY.
WHOO.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.189
THIS APARTMENT MAY BE ONE
OF THREE APARTMENTS

04:49.222 --> 04:51.725
ON THE MARKET.

04:55.395 --> 04:57.097
SAM.
- OH, HI.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.398
- HOW ARE YOU? LUIS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.466
PLEASURE.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:59.499 --> 05:00.567
- THANK YOU
FOR HAVING ME.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.701
- ABSOLUTELY.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.803
- OKAY.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.505
SO THIS IS THE PLACE
YOU'RE SELLING ON YOUR OWN.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.507
- RIGHT. YES.
EXACTLY.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.112
- LOVE THE CEILINGS.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.047
- YES, THE BEAMS
ARE REALLY NICE.

05:18.918 --> 05:21.121
THIS IS THE SECOND BEDROOM.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.789
RIGHT NOW I USE IT
AS MY OFFICE.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.357
- WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING,
IF I MAY ASK?

05:24.391 --> 05:25.525
- I'M A I.T. CONSULTANT.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.127
- AND YOU WORK MOSTLY
FROM HOME?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.228
- YES.
- THAT'S WHY IT'S EASY FOR YOU

05:28.261 --> 05:29.662
TO PUT THE APARTMENT
ON THE MARKET

05:29.696 --> 05:30.964
ON YOURSELF
BECAUSE YOU'LL ALWAYS BE HERE

05:31.064 --> 05:34.367
TO SHOW IT.
- ABSOLUTELY.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.405
- CAN I OPEN THIS?
- ABSOLUTELY.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.906
LARGE CLOSET SPACE.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.941
- VERY NICE.
MAYBE YOU CAN GET RID OF THIS,

05:41.975 --> 05:44.444
PUT A GLASS PANEL ON IT,
AND MAKE IT INTO A WINE COOLER

05:44.477 --> 05:46.579
WITH ALL THE BOTTLES SHOWING,
BA BA BA BA BA BA BA.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.815
- RIGHT. YEAH.
THAT'S AN INTERESTING IDEA.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.350
OKAY.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.519
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST COME INTO MIND.

05:52.552 --> 05:56.556
SAM'S PLACE HAS A GREAT LAYOUT
AND INCREDIBLE BONES,

05:56.589 --> 05:59.159
BUT THE OLD FURNITURE
AND THE WAY IT'S PLACED,

05:59.192 --> 06:01.795
IT'S GOING TO...

06:01.828 --> 06:03.229
DISTRACT BUYERS.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.532
WELL, FIRST I WANT TO GET TO
KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.833
- SURE.
- ABOUT YOUR WIFE,

06:06.866 --> 06:09.402
WHY YOU DECIDED TO MOVE.
- I MEAN, WE LIVED IN NEW YORK

06:09.436 --> 06:11.371
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

06:11.404 --> 06:13.540
SO WE WERE THINKING ABOUT,
IF WE WANTED TO MAKE A CHANGE,

06:13.573 --> 06:14.774
PROBABLY THIS IS THE TIME.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.176
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.510
- WE WERE THINKING WEST COAST.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.745
SAN FRANCISCO.
- REALLY?

06:18.778 --> 06:20.547
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.916
- SO YOU ARE SELLING
THIS APARTMENT ON YOUR OWN.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.117
- RIGHT.
- IT'S BEEN ON THE MARKET

06:24.150 --> 06:25.885
A LITTLE BIT OVER A MONTH.
HOW IS THAT GOING?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.320
- IT'S GOING GREAT.
I MEAN,

06:27.354 --> 06:30.056
WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO WHERE I WANT TO BE OBVIOUSLY,

06:30.056 --> 06:32.692
BUT, I MEAN, IT'S ONLY BEEN
FOUR WEEKS,

06:32.726 --> 06:34.060
SO I THINK IT'S VERY EARLY--

06:34.094 --> 06:35.328
- FOUR WEEKS IS A LONG TIME.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.429
- IS IT?
- FOR A MARKET LIKE THIS

06:36.463 --> 06:37.897
WHERE THERE'S NO INVENTORY.

06:37.931 --> 06:41.167
THIS IS THE ONLY TWO-BEDROOM
ON THE ENTIRE 80TH STREET SCOPE.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.203
- RIGHT.
- WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR STRATEGY

06:43.236 --> 06:45.438
TO SELL IT?
- I AM RUNNING ADS

06:45.472 --> 06:48.541
IN<i>THE NEW YORK TIMES,</i>
<i>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,</i>

06:48.575 --> 06:49.642
AND SO ON AND SO FORTH.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.077
- MOST OF THE CALLS
THAT YOU WILL GET

06:51.077 --> 06:52.645
FROM BUYERS ARE GOING TO BE
FROM UNQUALIFIED BUYERS.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.381
IN FACT, MOST OF THEM
WILL GIVE YOU

06:54.414 --> 06:55.882
AN OFFER THAT YOU MAY ACCEPT,

06:55.915 --> 06:57.283
AND THEY GO ALL THE WAY
TO CONTRACTS,

06:57.317 --> 06:59.152
ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY
CANNOT GET A LOAN FROM A BANK.

06:59.185 --> 07:00.887
YOU'VE WASTED SIX MONTHS.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.188
YOU HAVE A BUSINESS TO RUN.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.592
CAN YOU HANDLE THAT?

07:07.861 --> 07:09.129
LISTEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.764
I CAN SEE THE HESITATION,
AND I UNDERSTAND WHY.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.932
ONE OF THE REASONS YOU SHOULD
CONSIDER BEING REPRESENTED

07:13.033 --> 07:14.367
BY SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS
WHAT THEY'RE DOING

07:14.401 --> 07:16.469
IS BECAUSE YOU REALLY WANT
TO GET THE BEST PRICE

07:16.503 --> 07:19.139
YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET.
- RIGHT.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.608
- RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE THIS
APARTMENT LISTED AT 2,195,000.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.176
- CORRECT.
- IF YOU HIRE ME,

07:23.209 --> 07:26.046
I PROPOSE WE LIST THIS APARTMENT
AT 2,295,000,

07:26.046 --> 07:28.648
$100,000 MORE.

07:28.682 --> 07:33.553
- BUT WHY YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE
IT--YOU CAN SELL IT FOR MORE?

07:33.586 --> 07:34.954
- THIS IS WHAT I SEE.
THIS IS MY TAKE ON IT.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.790
THE PRESENTATION IS NOT GOOD.

07:36.823 --> 07:40.326
I NEED TO RESTAGE
THIS ENTIRE APARTMENT.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.295
GIVING A MAKEOVER
TO THE APARTMENT

07:42.328 --> 07:44.230
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE WORLD

07:44.264 --> 07:46.066
BECAUSE IT'LL GIVE
THE VISION

07:46.099 --> 07:49.469
TO BUYERS
WITHOUT IMAGINATION.

07:49.502 --> 07:52.339
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING MORE

07:52.372 --> 07:54.441
THAT PRETTY MUCH NO BODY ELSE
CAN OFFER YOU.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.511
I WILL TURN THIS APARTMENT
AROUND ON MY DIME.

07:58.545 --> 08:02.682
- THE $100,000
OVER MY ASKING PRICE

08:02.716 --> 08:04.851
OBVIOUSLY IS COMPELLING.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.453
- SO WE GOT A DEAL?

08:06.486 --> 08:08.355
- I THINK WE HAVE
A DEAL, YEAH.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.556
- SAM, CONGRATULATIONS.

08:09.589 --> 08:10.657
I WILL SEND YOU THE PAPERWORK
TONIGHT.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.125
THEN WE'LL GET STARTED

08:12.158 --> 08:13.426
AS SOON AS THIS WEEK.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.829
- SOUNDS GREAT.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.369
- [hums]

08:22.402 --> 08:24.137
MURRAY HILL'S A SECTION
OF MANHATTAN IN MIDTOWN.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.539
IT'S ACTUALLY BEST KNOWN

08:26.573 --> 08:30.944
FOR ITS HOT MOMS
AND POST-NYU GRADS.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.147
FUN FACT ABOUT MURRAY HILL:
WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO NEW YORK,

08:34.180 --> 08:38.485
I LOST MY VIRGINITY THERE
AT LEAST 12 TIMES.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.054
[doorbell rings]
AND IF ALL GOES WELL,

08:41.054 --> 08:43.056
HOPEFULLY PATRICIA LIVES UP
TO THE REPUTATION

08:43.056 --> 08:44.758
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.659
- HELLO, RYAN.
- HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?

08:46.693 --> 08:49.062
- WONDERFUL MEETING YOU.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.463
- THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.798
- ABSOLUTELY.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.968
O...KAY.
MAYBE NOT.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.636
SO DO YOU WANT TO SHOW ME AROUND
A LITTLE BIT?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.938
- SURE.
IT'S A WONDERFUL HOUSE

08:58.972 --> 09:01.207
BUILT IN 1856.

09:08.615 --> 09:10.083
I'LL SHOW YOU THE ELEVATOR.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.453
- WHOA.
THAT'S A LITTLE ELEVATOR.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.056
- AND THIS I GUESS
IS MY FAVORITE FLOOR.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.458
- MURRAY HILL'S KNOWN
FOR ITS LOW-RISE BUILDINGS

09:18.491 --> 09:20.894
AND ITS TOWNHOMES.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.328
PATRICIA'S HOUSE

09:22.362 --> 09:24.898
IS A CLASSIC ENGLISH ROW
TOWNHOUSE.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.701
FOR THE RIGHT PERSON,
IT IS A GEM.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.103
BUT...

09:30.136 --> 09:32.272
THE HOUSE FEELS VERY OLD.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.107
IT'S ALL "IT'S ORIGINAL."

09:34.140 --> 09:36.576
IT FEELS KIND OF LIKE
WE'RE IN THE 1800s A LITTLE BIT.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.144
- EXACTLY.
NO KIDDING.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.548
- THE FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE IT
CAME OFF THE<i>TITANIC.</i>

09:41.581 --> 09:43.483
[creaking]
- MM.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.251
- THE FLOORS ARE ALL CREAKY,

09:45.285 --> 09:46.653
AND THEY'VE STARTED
TO BUCKLE.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.388
IT'S A LITTLE BIT COLD
IN THIS ROOM.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.723
- IT IS COLD IN HERE.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.158
- IT IS AN OLD HOUSE.
IT IS HARD TO HEAT THIS THING.

09:52.192 --> 09:55.628
BUT IT IS LIKE A MEAT LOCKER.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.430
BONE-CHILLING.

09:57.464 --> 09:59.199
THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS HOUSE

09:59.232 --> 10:01.634
THAT FREAKS ME OUT.

10:01.668 --> 10:02.936
OH, YOU HAVE A LOT OF CROSSES.

10:02.969 --> 10:04.270
- I LOVE CROSSES, YES.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.106
- NO, LIKE, GHOSTS
IN THIS HOUSE, ARE THERE?

10:06.139 --> 10:07.307
- I DON'T KNOW.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.115
I'LL LET YOU GO
TO THE BASEMENT ALONE.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.283
- OKAY.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.826
WHAT?

10:30.764 --> 10:31.898
MM.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.600
[murmurs]

10:33.633 --> 10:35.602
GOOD. I'M GOOD WITH IT.
- IT'S HUGE.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.803
- OKAY.
- IT'S HUGE.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.238
- YEAH, NO, IT IS HUGE.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.173
WE CAN GO UPSTAIRS.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.542
PART OF ME WANTS
TO RUN OUT OF HERE,

10:42.575 --> 10:44.177
BUT THE OTHER PART OF ME
CAN'T STOP THINKING

10:44.210 --> 10:46.946
ABOUT THE 6-FIGURE COMMISSION.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.582
I THINK I'LL STAY.
SO ARE YOU ALL MOVED OUT NOW?

10:49.616 --> 10:52.686
- NO. THESE THINGS
HAVE TO BE MOVED.

10:52.719 --> 10:55.555
- OKAY, BUT ARE YOU LIVING HERE
NOW, OR ARE YOU LIVING--

10:55.588 --> 10:56.556
- I'M LIVING IN PALM BEACH.
- OKAY.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.658
SO YOU MOVED.
- MORE OR LESS.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.927
- OKAY. SO I WANT TO SELL THIS
AS FAST AS I CAN

11:00.960 --> 11:02.262
BECAUSE YOU'VE
ALREADY RELOCATED.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.130
- I BET YOU COULD DO ANYTHING.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.500
[laughter]
- OKAY.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.769
- IT'S EASY TO LOOK
AT YOU, RYAN.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.137
[laughter]

11:11.171 --> 11:12.572
- UH, THANK YOU.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.941
SO NOW
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING...

11:14.974 --> 11:16.209
IS PRICE.

11:16.242 --> 11:18.278
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO PRICE IT TOO LOW,

11:18.311 --> 11:19.446
AND I DON'T WANT
TO PRICE IT TOO HIGH.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.448
I THINK THE HAPPY MEDIUM
WOULD BE

11:21.481 --> 11:24.718
JUST A LITTLE BIT
BELOW 4 MILLION.

11:24.751 --> 11:27.387
YOU KNOW, 3,995,000.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.830
- I BLACKED OUT THERE.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.498
WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.101
OH, I KNOW
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.969
I AGREE WITH YOU.
- YOU AGREE WITH ME?

11:43.003 --> 11:45.171
- YES.
- YES! I GOT IT.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.774
- I'M CONVINCED
THAT YOU CAN SELL IT.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.442
- NOW I JUST HAVE
TO FIND A BUYER

11:49.476 --> 11:52.112
FOR THIS SPOOKY, OLD...

11:52.112 --> 11:56.116
I MEAN, CHARMING
AND WEATHERED ANTIQUE.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.350
- GOOD-BYE NOW.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.452
GOOD LUCK.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.322
- SO THIS IS BEDROOMS
UP HERE.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.790
[creaking]

12:03.823 --> 12:06.292
THERE'S SOME WEIRD STUFF
GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.595
OLIVIA!

12:15.702 --> 12:17.203
- MR. SAM.
THERE HE IS.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.105
- HI, LUIS. HOW ARE YOU?
- MEET ANNE.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.407
ANNE, THIS IS SAM.
- HI.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.275
- SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
- SAM'S PLACE IS NICE,

12:22.308 --> 12:23.810
BUT I NEED TO MAKE IT
LOOK PERFECT,

12:23.843 --> 12:25.178
SO FOR THAT REASON

12:25.211 --> 12:26.346
I BROUGHT ANNE
TO MAKE THIS APARTMENT

12:26.379 --> 12:28.381
LOOK WHAT IT NEEDS
TO LOOK LIKE

12:28.415 --> 12:30.383
IN ORDER FOR ME TO SELL IT
FOR $100,000 MORE.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.951
SO I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.087
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH MODERNIZING
THIS PLACE.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.655
I THINK WE'RE GONNA CHANGE
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING.

12:35.689 --> 12:36.923
NO OFFENSE.
WE ARE PAINTING

12:36.956 --> 12:38.525
THIS WALL,
WE'RE PAINTING THE DINING ROOM,

12:38.558 --> 12:40.527
WE'LL PUT THE COUCH THAT WAY.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.095
ALL RIGHT, SO ARE YOU READY
TO TURN THIS THING AROUND?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.697
- ABSOLUTELY.
IT SOUNDS EXCITING.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.565
- THE TRUCK IS HERE.
- THE TRUCK IS HERE. LET'S GO.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.346
- HEY, SAM.
- YES.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.214
MY CHAIR?
WOW.

13:01.247 --> 13:04.050
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA KEEP
MY CHAIR.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.886
HEY, LUIS.
- YES?

13:06.920 --> 13:08.455
- THEY'RE TAKING MY CHAIR.
- LET'S GO GET A DRINK

13:08.488 --> 13:09.656
AND LET THEM DO THEIR THING.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.825
PLEASE, SAM, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.

13:11.858 --> 13:14.661
- OKAY.
WELL, COOL.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.201
SO ARE YOU READY?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.169
ALL RIGHT.
- WHOA.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.573
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.449
- DO I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING,
OR DO I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING?

13:39.085 --> 13:41.788
- NOW I HAVE TO TAKE
ALL OF THIS IN.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.090
THIS IS CRAZY.

13:44.090 --> 13:47.093
- OH, I HOPE HE MEANS
THIS IS CRAZY GOOD.

13:47.093 --> 13:49.095
THIS IS NOW HOW YOU CAN JUSTIFY

13:49.129 --> 13:50.530
ON A $100,000 INCREASE.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.931
- I SEE.
YEAH.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.167
- LET'S GO SEE YOUR OFFICE, MAN.
- SURE.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.775
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY DESKTOP?

14:01.808 --> 14:04.411
I STILL HAVE TO WORK
FROM HOME NOW.

14:04.444 --> 14:08.782
- UM, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THE COMPUTER ACTUALLY IS HERE.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.050
- RIGHT.
- AND WHAT I REALLY NEED...

14:10.050 --> 14:12.252
- OKAY.
- IS THAT EVERY TIME YOU USE IT,

14:12.285 --> 14:15.555
EVERY TIME I'M SHOWING IT,
YOU TAKE IT OUT.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.123
- OH, I HAVE TO UNPLUG IT
AND PLUG--

14:17.157 --> 14:19.926
- I KNOW.
LISTEN, SACRIFICE.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.697
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
- SACRIFICE IS THE KEY

14:23.730 --> 14:24.864
TO EVERYTHING, RIGHT?
- I HEAR YOU.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.900
I HEAR YOU.
- HE NEEDS TO TRUST ME.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.903
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO WORK.
HE'LL THANK ME LATER.

14:29.936 --> 14:32.439
- IS THIS FURNITURE NEW?
IT'S BEEN IN OTHER PLACES

14:32.472 --> 14:35.308
YOU'VE STAGED BEFORE?

14:35.342 --> 14:37.143
- I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
IT LOOKS BRAND-NEW, RIGHT?

14:37.177 --> 14:38.511
- I'M JUST CONCERNED

14:38.545 --> 14:41.381
HOW COMFORTABLE I FEEL

14:41.414 --> 14:44.117
SITTING IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S--
- WELL, REST ASSURED,

14:44.150 --> 14:46.486
NOBODY HAS EVER HAD SEX
ON THIS COUCH--GUARANTEED.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.455
- OKAY, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.657
[laughter]

14:55.195 --> 14:57.230
- OKAY, CLOSE YOUR EYES.

14:57.263 --> 14:59.366
WALK, WALK, WALK, WALK.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.534
OPEN.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.037
- THIS IS NICE.
- THIS IS GORGEOUS.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.306
- OKAY, YOU GET STARTED.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.542
WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS APARTMENT,

15:09.576 --> 15:11.378
MY JAW DROPPED
TO THE FLOOR.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.279
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.315
JORDAN, PLEASE HELP ME.
THIS HAS TO BE PERFECT.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.950
SO THE FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS

15:17.050 --> 15:19.686
WILL BE TO PHOTOGRAPH IT
AND SHOW IT OFF THE WORLD.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.755
THIS IS A NICE ONE.
STRAIGHT ON, LIKE--BAM.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.056
AND YOU'RE GONNA CATCH THIS

15:23.056 --> 15:25.625
AND THE REFLECTION
IN THE VENETIAN PLASTER.

15:27.861 --> 15:30.196
HOW MANY DAYS
IS THIS GONNA TAKE?

15:30.230 --> 15:33.066
I MEAN, GETTING THESE BACK.
- LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

15:33.066 --> 15:37.537
- WELL, 24 HOURS
IS 23 HOURS AND 59 MINUTES LOST.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.339
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA TAKE
A SELFIE.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.540
SOCIAL MEDIA.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.776
SOCIAL MEDIA IS INSTRUMENTAL
FOR MY BUSINESS

15:42.809 --> 15:43.877
THESE DAYS.

15:43.910 --> 15:44.978
I HAVE 300,000 FOLLOWERS,

15:45.078 --> 15:46.980
AND I'M ACTUALLY
GONNA POST THIS NOW.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.615
IT'S FAST,
IT'S FREE,

15:48.648 --> 15:50.650
AND IT REACHES
A LOT MORE PEOPLE.

15:50.684 --> 15:51.885
- WORK IT.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.286
- IT'S EXCITING.
YOU SNAP SOMETHING,

15:53.319 --> 15:54.287
YOU UPLOAD IT.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.488
LET ME INSTAGRAM THAT.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.523
IT REALLY FITS MY PERSONALITY.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.191
I'M NOT VERY PATIENT.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.226
OKAY, HERE.
WE NEED ONE MORE PHOTO.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.561
THIS ONE IS FOR FACEBOOK.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.930
JUST LIKE A SILHOUETTE.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.932
OH.
1,000 LIKES.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.572
- MAN.
[door slams]

16:12.605 --> 16:14.174
I'LL GET THIS SIDE IF YOU WANT

16:14.207 --> 16:15.909
TO START BRINGING STUFF IN
FROM THE BACK.

16:15.942 --> 16:17.577
EVEN THOUGH THIS PLACE
MADE ME UNCOMFORTABLE

16:17.610 --> 16:18.912
IN THE LISTING MEETING,

16:18.945 --> 16:20.580
I'M STILL GONNA TREAT THIS PLACE

16:20.613 --> 16:24.084
LIKE EVERY OTHER LISTING
AND DO MY BEST TO SELL IT.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.921
- OH, MY GOD.
THESE SMELL DELICIOUS.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.689
- BECAUSE THIS IS
AN ENGLISH ROW HOUSE,

16:29.723 --> 16:32.125
MY STRATEGY

16:32.158 --> 16:34.260
IS TO DO AN ENGLISH
LITTLE AFTERNOON TEA.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.129
SOME LITTLE FINGER SANDWICHES,

16:36.162 --> 16:38.298
SOME PASTRIES.
MMM.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.534
AND, YOU KNOW,
CATER TO TOWNHOUSE BROKERS.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.069
OKAY.

16:46.740 --> 16:47.874
[kettle whistling]

16:57.717 --> 16:59.719
[rattling]

17:05.759 --> 17:06.760
HELLO.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.102
OH, MY [bleep] GOD.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.338
IS THIS A JOKE?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.040
HELLO.
OLIVIA?

17:20.040 --> 17:23.143
I'M STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR!

17:25.412 --> 17:28.048
OLIVIA! CAN YOU PLEASE
COME GET ME?

17:28.048 --> 17:31.718
I'M LIKE ON THE THIRD FLOOR.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.953
WHAT THE [bleep] IS GOING ON
WITH THIS THING?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.056
[clank]

17:36.056 --> 17:37.657
[machinery hums]

17:37.691 --> 17:39.259
WHOA.
OH, MY GOD.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.895
IT COULD HAVE BEEN,
LIKE, AN ELECTRICAL MALFUNCTION.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.329
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.732
[whispers]
[bleep] ELEVATOR.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.734
BUT IN THIS HOUSE

17:47.767 --> 17:50.236
I AM JUST CREEPED OUT.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.771
NEVER GOING IN THERE
EVER AGAIN.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.640
THANK YOU!

17:53.673 --> 17:55.542
I'M OKAY.
- WHAT?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.480
[doorbell rings]

18:01.648 --> 18:02.916
both: HI.

18:03.016 --> 18:04.017
- RYAN.
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

18:04.017 --> 18:05.352
RYAN.
- JACOB.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.453
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

18:06.486 --> 18:07.787
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.022
- WE'RE HAVING
A TEA PARTY IN HERE.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.590
DO YOU WANT A SANDWICH
OR ANY TEA OR ANYTHING?

18:10.623 --> 18:11.925
- PLEASE. YES.
- OKAY.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.460
SO IT'S
AN ENGLISH-STYLE TOWNHOUSE

18:13.493 --> 18:15.628
WHERE THEY HAD
THE KITCHEN DOWNSTAIRS

18:15.662 --> 18:17.731
WITH EASY ACCESS
TO OUTDOOR SPACE.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.399
YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE.
FIREPLACES ALL WORK.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.134
VERY NICE.
HARD TO FIND.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.135
FLOORS HAVEN'T BEEN TOUCHED

18:22.168 --> 18:23.370
SINCE THE HOUSE
WAS BUILT IN 1857.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.637
- THIS PLACE IS PRETTY BIG.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.306
IS IT FIVE FLOORS?
- YES.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.807
AND THERE IS AN ELEVATOR,

18:27.841 --> 18:29.609
BUT, IF YOU DON'T MIND,
WE'LL TAKE THE STAIRS,

18:29.642 --> 18:31.945
'CAUSE WE CAN'T ALL FIT
IN THE ELEVATOR.

18:32.045 --> 18:35.815
SO THIS IS BEDROOMS UP HERE.
[squeaking]

18:37.917 --> 18:39.619
THAT WAS WEIRD.
THERE'S BEDROOMS UP HERE,

18:39.652 --> 18:40.954
THERE COULD BE A BEDROOM
OVER HERE.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.822
I COULD SHOW YOU.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.057
SO THEN THIS IS A TOP FLOOR.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.459
YOU'LL SEE
THERE'S A SKYLIGHT

18:46.493 --> 18:47.460
UP THERE.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.828
DID SOMEONE LEAVE
THE WATER ON?

18:48.862 --> 18:51.464
[water running]

18:51.498 --> 18:53.066
- OH, WOW.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.569
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS GOING ON?

18:56.603 --> 18:58.538
THERE'S SOME WEIRD STUFF
GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.307
- CAN WE SEE THE BASEMENT,
BY ANY CHANCE?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.009
- OH, MY GOD.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.678
THE DOLLS ARE STILL THERE.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.279
SURE.
WHY NOT?

19:06.312 --> 19:09.215
I DIDN'T WANT TO MOVE THEM.
I DIDN'T WANT TO TOUCH THEM.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.619
I WAS GOING TO,
BUT THEN I FORGOT.

19:12.652 --> 19:16.089
THE BOILER'S NEW.
EVERYTHING'S GOOD TO GO.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.460
[animal chittering;
women gasping]

19:20.493 --> 19:22.395
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A RAT
BACK THERE, HUH?

19:22.429 --> 19:23.730
- I THINK WE'RE READY TO GO UP.
- YES.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.398
- OKAY. SURE.
both: YES.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.566
- NO PROBLEM.
- THAT JUST MADE ME

19:26.599 --> 19:27.901
REALLY THINK
OF SOME HORROR FILMS,

19:27.934 --> 19:29.602
SOMEONE COMING AT YOU.

19:29.636 --> 19:33.306
- WHAT. THE. [bleep]?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.075
- HOW IS THE HEATER
IN THIS PLACE?

19:35.108 --> 19:36.743
- IT'S REALLY COLD IN HERE.
IS THERE HEAT?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.845
- IT'S AT 80.
I'M NOT CRAZY.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.681
OTHER PEOPLE
ARE NOTICING STUFF TOO.

19:41.715 --> 19:44.117
MASTER BEDROOM.
YEAH, NO.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.052
NO, THAT WOULD BE CRAZY.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.056
[creaking]

19:50.090 --> 19:51.925
- HELLO?

19:53.693 --> 19:55.662
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

19:55.695 --> 19:57.430
RYAN?

19:57.464 --> 19:59.499
- IT HAS A LITTLE...
- CHARACTER.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.968
- WELL, IT'S OLD, YOU KNOW,
SO YOU NEVER KNOW.

20:02.002 --> 20:04.137
BUT IT IS A GOOD SPACE.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.339
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
IN THIS HOUSE.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.707
- ARE WE DONE?
- YES.

20:07.741 --> 20:09.142
- GOOD!

20:09.175 --> 20:13.013
- OKAY, LET'S CLEAN UP,
AND LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.815
- DO YOU GET
A GOOD FEELING?

20:15.849 --> 20:19.619
- WELL, I THINK--I MEAN,
ARE WE ACTUALLY READY?

20:33.433 --> 20:36.469
- THE PHOTOS AT 101 WARREN
TURNED OUT AMAZINGLY WELL.

20:36.503 --> 20:38.571
THE PROFESSIONAL ONES...

20:38.605 --> 20:42.742
BUT ALSO THE ONES THAT I TOOK
FOR MY SOCIAL MEDIA.

20:42.776 --> 20:44.444
I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GONNA WANT
TO COME IN AND SEE

20:44.477 --> 20:45.545
THIS APARTMENT.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.579
BABE.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.782
THE AGENCY JUST SENT US

20:48.815 --> 20:50.817
A COUPLE OF ALTERNATIVES
FOR THE SURROGATE.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.753
- OKAY.
- DEREK AND I RECENTLY JOINED

20:53.787 --> 20:56.322
A SURROGACY AGENCY
TO HELP US FIND A WOMAN

20:56.356 --> 20:57.824
TO CARRY OUR BABY.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.492
FRITZY, YOU WANT TO SEE?

20:59.526 --> 21:01.461
I'VE KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME

21:01.494 --> 21:02.796
THAT I WANT A LITTLE GIRL,

21:02.829 --> 21:04.864
AND NOW,
WHEN I FINALLY MET DEREK,

21:04.898 --> 21:07.300
I KNOW IN MY HEART
THAT THE STARS ARE ALIGNED

21:07.334 --> 21:09.803
AND IT'S TIME
TO START A FAMILY.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.371
WE NEED TO START, LIKE,

21:11.404 --> 21:15.375
BASICALLY NARROWING DOWN
WHO WE WANT AS OUR OVEN.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.743
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER TO ME

21:16.776 --> 21:18.311
AS LONG AS SHE EATS
A LOT OF SWEDISH MEATBALLS

21:18.345 --> 21:20.780
AND HIGH KICKS.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.282
- [chuckles]
[message alert]

21:22.315 --> 21:23.717
- SHE JUST SENT ANOTHER ONE.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.086
SHE LIVES IN COLORADO.

21:26.086 --> 21:27.487
- WE DON'T WANT TO GO
THAT FAR.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.755
- OKAY, THEN WE HAVE
SOMEONE HERE.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.091
SHE'S FROM MAINE.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.792
SHE LOOKS REALLY HEALTHY.

21:32.826 --> 21:34.627
DO YOU GET A GOOD FEELING?

21:36.296 --> 21:39.666
- WELL, I THINK--
I MEAN, THIS IS,

21:39.699 --> 21:42.535
UM, IT'S LIKE--
I MEAN,

21:42.569 --> 21:44.304
ARE WE ACTUALLY READY?

21:44.337 --> 21:46.706
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YEAH, WE WANT TO HAVE A CHILD.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.209
BUT ARE WE ACTUALLY READY
TO HAVE A CHILD

21:49.242 --> 21:51.544
IN NINE MONTHS' TIME?

21:51.578 --> 21:54.180
A BABY, LIKE, SCREAMING
AND CRYING IN OUR HOUSE.

21:54.214 --> 21:55.482
- YOU DON'T WANT TO NOW?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.951
- NO, I'M JUST SAYING,
IT'S LIKE...

21:57.984 --> 22:00.920
I MEAN, THIS IS--
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING,

22:00.954 --> 22:04.057
BUT, I MEAN, IT'S QUITE SCARY
IF I'M HONEST.

22:04.057 --> 22:06.292
- WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
IF I'M READY?

22:06.326 --> 22:09.229
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE NOT READY?

22:09.262 --> 22:10.930
I THOUGHT WE WERE READY.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.300
YEAH, BUT, BABE,
LOOK AT THIS.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.770
LOOK AT ALL THE PICTURES
OF THESE LITTLE BABIES.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.304
WHEN WE'RE GONNA LOOK
AT THAT LITTLE ANGEL

22:18.338 --> 22:20.573
IN NINE MONTHS,
THAT LITTLE GIRL--

22:20.607 --> 22:22.809
- IT IS STILL A BABY
THAT IS GONNA SCREAM

22:22.842 --> 22:25.412
AND SHOUT AND CRY,
AND IT'S GOING

22:25.445 --> 22:27.781
TO NEED YOU EVERY SECOND
OF ITS EXISTENCE

22:27.814 --> 22:30.650
FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.988
ARE YOU ACTUALLY READY TO HAVE
A BABY IN NINE MONTHS' TIME?

22:35.088 --> 22:37.090
- MY WHOLE LIFE
I ENVISIONED THIS.

22:37.090 --> 22:40.894
I MEAN, LITTLE MILA, REGARDLESS
WHO'S GONNA CARRY HER,

22:40.927 --> 22:42.862
IS ACTUALLY COMING.

22:42.896 --> 22:45.231
THAT IN ITSELF
IS, LIKE, HUGE.

22:45.265 --> 22:48.201
WELL, MILA
IS MY FUTURE DAUGHTER.

22:48.234 --> 22:50.270
OUR FUTURE DAUGHTER.

22:50.303 --> 22:52.205
I CAN CLOSE MY EYES--
BLUE EYES,

22:52.238 --> 22:56.643
BROWN, CURLY HAIR,
LITTLE FINGERS.

22:56.676 --> 22:58.211
SO ADORABLE.

22:58.244 --> 23:01.748
I THINK IT'S AMAZING
WE'RE DOING THIS.

23:01.781 --> 23:03.783
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED TO HEAR
THAT DEREK'S HAVING HESITATIONS

23:03.817 --> 23:07.687
AND SECOND THOUGHTS,
BUT I DO BELIEVE

23:07.721 --> 23:10.623
THAT, AS WE GO ALONG,
HE'LL START TO EASE UP

23:10.657 --> 23:11.925
AND FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.960
DO YOU THINK FRITZY'S
GONNA GET JEALOUS?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.096
- [chuckling]
YES.

23:22.936 --> 23:25.939
- SINCE MY OPEN HOUSE,
I'VE HAD NO OFFERS.

23:25.972 --> 23:27.640
LIKE NO FEEDBACK WHATSOEVER.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.709
I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK
PEOPLE FELT COMFORTABLE THERE.

23:29.743 --> 23:32.746
"HAZEL--PROTECTION
AGAINST THE DARK SIDE."

23:32.779 --> 23:35.615
WHERE ARE
THE ACTUAL GHOST HUNTERS?

23:35.648 --> 23:38.084
[muttering]

23:38.084 --> 23:39.953
GHOST GROUPIES.
- UMM...

23:39.986 --> 23:41.454
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:41.488 --> 23:42.655
- I DON'T KNOW
LIKE WHAT IS IS,

23:42.689 --> 23:45.091
BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S
JUST SOMETHING

23:45.091 --> 23:46.693
THAT'S NOT RIGHT
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.529
EVEN THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE
IN GHOSTS,

23:49.562 --> 23:50.997
I'M GONNA COVER ALL MY BASES

23:51.097 --> 23:53.566
AND GET
ALL OF THE BAD ENERGY OUT.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.535
CAN WE GET SOMEONE
TO DO, LIKE, A CLEANSE?

23:55.568 --> 23:57.103
LIKE, AN ENERGY CLEANSE?

23:57.137 --> 23:59.739
YOU KNOW, LIKE...
[chants nonsense]

23:59.773 --> 24:02.175
SPIRITS GO AWAY.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.376
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

24:03.410 --> 24:05.545
- NO, I DON'T.

24:05.578 --> 24:06.746
- THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT
OF PEOPLE THAT DO THAT.

24:06.780 --> 24:07.947
I THINK I'VE GONE
ON A FEW DATES

24:08.048 --> 24:09.582
WITH WOMEN THAT DO THAT.
COULD YOU FIND SOMEBODY?

24:09.616 --> 24:10.784
PLEASE?

24:10.817 --> 24:11.818
I'LL MEET THEM THERE,

24:11.851 --> 24:12.819
AND WE'LL GO THROUGH.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.154
IT'LL JUST MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.523
PLEASE.

24:16.556 --> 24:17.757
- SURE.
- THANK YOU.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.759
- I'M JUST GONNA DO
SOME REAL WORK FIRST

24:19.793 --> 24:21.528
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.530
- OLIVIA'S THE BEST.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.475
[door shuts]
- OKAY.

24:35.508 --> 24:36.976
OH, COME ON, MR. SAM.
- OH, RIGHT. LUIS.

24:37.077 --> 24:38.445
- I GOT A SHOWING
IN TWO MINUTES.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.979
- REALLY? WOW!
- TWO MINUTES.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.348
- I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU YET.

24:41.381 --> 24:42.816
- THEY'RE COMING A LITTLE BIT
EARLIER THAN I THOUGHT.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.250
- OH, REALLY?

24:44.284 --> 24:46.086
- NOW THIS PLACE IS STAGED
AND LOOKS BEAUTIFUL,

24:46.086 --> 24:48.588
I HAVE A TON OF SHOWINGS SET UP
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.458
- I GOT FIVE MORE MINUTES
OF<i>DOWNTON ABBEY</i>TO WATCH.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.159
- I AM SO SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

24:53.193 --> 24:54.894
- SOME CHICKEN SALAD.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.930
- SAM AND I HAD COME
TO AN AGREEMENT

24:56.963 --> 24:58.631
THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE
APARTMENT WHEN I WAS SHOWING IT

24:58.665 --> 25:00.133
BECAUSE IT IS CRUCIAL

25:00.166 --> 25:01.835
TO GIVE THE ILLUSION THAT NOBODY
LIVES IN THE APARTMENT.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.671
NOBODY LIKES TO BUY SOMETHING
THAT'S USED.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.139
YOU WANT PEOPLE FEELING
THAT THEY'RE COMING

25:06.172 --> 25:08.241
INTO A BRAND-NEW SPACE.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.809
- ALL RIGHT, MAN, I'M GONNA GET
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.211
- NOT ONLY IS HE HOME,

25:11.244 --> 25:13.646
BUT THIS PLACE SMELLS
LIKE A CHEAP FROZEN BURRITO.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.049
- HELLO?
- YUP.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.220
- LUIS.
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

25:20.253 --> 25:21.321
LUIS.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.322
HELLO.
- AMANDA.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.723
- HOW ARE YOU?
WELCOME.

25:23.757 --> 25:24.858
THIS IS TWO-BEDROOM,
TWO-BATHROOM.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.960
THE UNIT WAS RENOVATED
IN 2007.

25:27.060 --> 25:29.462
FULL BATHROOM HERE,
SO THE BATHROOM IS NOT EN-SUITE.

25:29.496 --> 25:30.930
- IS IT CENTRAL A/C HERE?

25:30.964 --> 25:32.532
- WE HAVE--
SAM, YES, SIR.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.534
- SORRY, LUIS.
I HAVE TO GET MY JACKET--

25:34.567 --> 25:36.136
- NO PROBLEM.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

25:36.169 --> 25:39.406
- IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE?

25:39.439 --> 25:41.908
OKAY, LET'S GO, PLEASE.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.477
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION?

25:44.511 --> 25:45.712
HELLO.
- LUIS.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.480
- HOW ARE YOU, SIR?
- WELL. HOW ARE YOU?

25:47.514 --> 25:48.648
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
PLEASE COME IN.

25:48.682 --> 25:50.650
THIS IS THE ONLY TWO-BEDROOM
AVAILABLE

25:50.684 --> 25:52.085
IN THE BUILDING RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.920
- IT'S 1,413 SQUARE FEET.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.255
HELLO.
OH, MY GOD.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.090
HOW ARE YOU?
- SO GOOD TO SEE YOU, DARLING.

25:57.090 --> 25:58.558
HOW ARE YOU?
both: MWAH. MWAH.

25:58.591 --> 26:01.027
- WOW, THIS IS FAB.
- BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.829
IT'S DECORATED
REALLY, REALLY NICELY.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.197
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- THE COLORS ARE JUST GREAT.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.399
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THE SECOND BEDROOM.

26:06.433 --> 26:08.034
both: WOW.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.602
- PERFECT.
- PERFECT.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.338
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
OH, THERE HE IS.

26:11.371 --> 26:12.672
- HI, LUIS.
HOW ARE YOU?

26:12.706 --> 26:14.874
- THIS IS SAM, THE OWNER
OF THE APARTMENT, ACTUALLY.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.776
- OH, HI, SAM.
- I LOVE SAMS.

26:16.810 --> 26:18.478
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

26:18.511 --> 26:21.448
- OH, ALL RIGHT,
SAM IS HERE AGAIN.

26:24.718 --> 26:26.653
OKAY.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.922
MR. SAM, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE NOT HERE.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.557
OH, MY GOD.
THE CLIENT'S OUTSIDE.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.059
I NEED TO TAKE
THE COMPUTER OUT.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.662
SAM, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH,

26:35.695 --> 26:39.666
BUT THIS CANNOT HAPPEN
ANYMORE, OKAY?

26:39.699 --> 26:41.167
<i>POR FAVOR.</i>

26:41.201 --> 26:43.336
WOW, YOU REALLY ARE
DOING THIS TO ME.

26:43.370 --> 26:44.838
I'M REALLY STARTING
TO QUESTION

26:44.871 --> 26:47.107
IF SAM REALLY WANTS
TO SELL THIS APARTMENT OR NOT.

26:47.140 --> 26:50.877
I REALLY HOPE I'M NOT WASTING
MY MONEY AND TIME HERE.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.153
- WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE?
SOME WINE?

27:00.186 --> 27:02.055
TO MAKE YOU FRISKY.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.323
[laughter]

27:03.356 --> 27:05.158
- HI, GUYS.
- HI, GUYS.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.793
- HI.
OHH.

27:06.826 --> 27:09.029
I'M TOO TIRED
TO STAND UP.

27:09.029 --> 27:11.031
MAINTAINING GOOD RELATIONSHIPS
WITH MY CLIENTS

27:11.031 --> 27:12.298
IS REALLY CRUCIAL.

27:12.332 --> 27:14.501
I LAUNCHED SALES
IN ZACH'S NEW DEVELOPMENT

27:14.534 --> 27:16.469
AT 11 NORTH MOORE
A MONTH AGO,

27:16.503 --> 27:18.104
AND SINCE THEN I'VE SOLD
EVERYTHING

27:18.138 --> 27:20.807
BUT THE BIG
$40 MILLION PENTHOUSE.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.877
AND ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE MONTHS
UNTIL I SELL IT,

27:23.910 --> 27:27.681
I STILL NEED TO UPDATE ZACH
ON EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.382
- SO, YOU KNOW, MY QUESTION.

27:29.416 --> 27:32.786
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH PENTHOUSE 11?

27:32.819 --> 27:35.955
- WELL, I TOLD YOU
FROM THE BEGINNING...

27:36.056 --> 27:37.824
THE BUILDING

27:37.857 --> 27:39.592
IS IN A STATE OF, LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

27:39.626 --> 27:42.295
IT'S VERY RAW, IT'S VERY COLD,
THERE'S SNOW.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.097
I KNOW IT'S A BIG TICKET
FOR YOU GUYS,

27:44.130 --> 27:45.965
AND A BIG COMMISSION
FOR ME TOO.

27:46.066 --> 27:47.934
- I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
TOO BIG, EXPLODE,

27:47.967 --> 27:49.069
AND THEN FORGET ABOUT US.

27:49.102 --> 27:50.770
- ZACH.
- I JUST WANT TO KNOW

27:50.804 --> 27:52.639
THAT OUR PROJECTS ARE STILL
GONNA GET THE ATTENTION

27:52.672 --> 27:54.140
THEY'VE ALWAYS GOTTEN.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.642
- I WILL ALWAYS GIVE YOU VIP.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.610
YOU ARE ALWAYS
MY NUMBER ONE CLIENT.

27:57.644 --> 27:59.379
- I DID WANT TO ASK YOU--

27:59.412 --> 28:01.715
THERE WAS A PICTURE
YOU POSTED

28:01.748 --> 28:04.351
THE OTHER DAY
FOR 101 MOORE.

28:04.384 --> 28:05.719
- OH, THE PENTHOUSE.
- YEAH.

28:05.752 --> 28:08.088
- OH, MY GOD.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.557
I MEAN, I WALKED IN,
AND I GOT GOOSEBUMPS.

28:10.590 --> 28:13.860
I MEAN, THOSE VIEWS, THAT
WRAPAROUND TERRACE, IS INSANE.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.228
LIKE, REALLY CRAZY.

28:15.261 --> 28:18.431
- LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

28:18.465 --> 28:20.133
- WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR--

28:20.166 --> 28:21.634
YOU HAVE SO MANY PROPERTIES.

28:21.668 --> 28:22.769
LIKE, AS AN INVESTMENT.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.371
- WE'VE BEEN BUYING
SOME RETAIL,

28:24.404 --> 28:27.207
AND THEN WE'RE DOING MORE
RENTAL PROJECTS AS WELL, SO...

28:27.240 --> 28:29.042
- WOW.

28:29.042 --> 28:31.911
THIS IS AMAZING.

28:31.945 --> 28:35.448
I JUST POSTED SOME PHOTOS
OF THE APARTMENT ON INSTAGRAM,

28:35.482 --> 28:39.319
AND ALREADY ONE OF THE BIGGEST
DEVELOPERS IN THE CITY

28:39.352 --> 28:42.589
HAS TAKEN NOTICE.
#WHEE!

28:42.622 --> 28:43.790
CHEERS, GUYS.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.393
TO 101 WARREN.
- CHEERS.

28:46.426 --> 28:48.094
- CHEERS.

28:48.128 --> 28:50.063
- I JUST GOT AN OFFER.

28:50.096 --> 28:54.167
AM I GOOD,
OR AM I GOOD?

28:54.200 --> 28:55.702
COME ON, SAM.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.405
YOU CAN'T DO THIS
TO ME NOW.

29:09.115 --> 29:12.252
- I WOULD SAY PANTS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

29:12.285 --> 29:14.187
I CONTINUE
TO FIND THEM A CHALLENGE.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.259
I DON'T HAVE A UNIQUE STYLE
OF PANTS.

29:19.292 --> 29:20.927
I HAVE A UNIQUE STYLE
OF LEGS.

29:21.027 --> 29:23.063
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I HAVE LARGE LEGS,

29:23.096 --> 29:24.531
BUT I HAVE A SMALL WAIST.

29:24.564 --> 29:26.433
IF IT WERE UP TO ME,

29:26.466 --> 29:30.337
I WOULD LIVE
IN A PANTSLESS WORLD.

29:30.370 --> 29:31.471
[grunts]

29:33.873 --> 29:36.509
I'M SORRY GOD MADE ME
LIKE THIS...

29:36.543 --> 29:38.645
PERFECT.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.485
[muttering]

29:45.518 --> 29:47.454
[groans]

29:47.487 --> 29:48.488
GOD DAMN IT!

30:00.333 --> 30:01.634
- ARE YOU READY?

30:01.668 --> 30:03.003
THIS IS IT.

30:03.036 --> 30:04.070
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

30:04.104 --> 30:06.039
I'M SAYING THE OBVIOUS HERE.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.141
THE LIGHT IS JUST INSANE.

30:08.174 --> 30:09.476
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SUNSET,

30:09.509 --> 30:10.810
WHICH IS STARTING
TO HAPPEN.

30:10.844 --> 30:12.645
YOU HAVE THE UPTOWN VIEW HERE.

30:12.679 --> 30:14.547
THIS IS LIKE A DIFFERENT KIND
OF SHOWING ALL IN ALL,

30:14.581 --> 30:15.949
BECAUSE MAYBE
I SHOULD JUST BE QUIET

30:15.982 --> 30:18.985
BECAUSE
YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.727
I'M TRYING TO...
SEE YOUR FACE,

30:27.761 --> 30:29.562
LIKE, READ
INTO WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

30:29.596 --> 30:31.831
I MEAN, LOOK AT--
ZACH, LOOK AT THIS.

30:31.865 --> 30:33.433
I MEAN, THINK OF THE SUMMERS

30:33.466 --> 30:36.403
AND YOU'RE GRILLING
SWEDISH MEATBALLS OVER THERE,

30:36.436 --> 30:39.105
MOUSEY, FRITZY RUNNING THERE.

30:41.508 --> 30:43.677
- WHAT'S THE ASKING PRICE?

30:43.710 --> 30:47.480
- THE ASKING PRICE
WILL BE 11 MILLION.

30:47.514 --> 30:48.815
BUT YOU GOT TO ADMIT, ZACH,

30:48.848 --> 30:51.751
IT LOOKS GORGEOUS.

30:51.785 --> 30:54.254
LOOK AT THE RUGS, THE CURTAINS.

30:54.287 --> 30:56.990
LOOK AT THE VENETIAN GLASS.
LOOK AT THE TVs, THE SPEAKERS.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.295
I'M NOT REALLY USED
TO REPRESENTING

31:02.328 --> 31:04.064
ZACH AS A BUYER,
AND HIS POKER FACE

31:04.064 --> 31:07.067
IS JUST MAKING THINGS
EVEN MORE CONFUSING FOR ME.

31:07.067 --> 31:10.403
OKAY, THIS MASTER
IS JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

31:10.437 --> 31:11.838
IT'S UNUSUAL TO HAVE
A BIG MASTER

31:11.871 --> 31:14.274
ON THE CORNER LIKE THIS.

31:17.410 --> 31:20.380
- I THINK THIS MAKES SENSE
AS AN INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

31:20.413 --> 31:22.482
- * DING *

31:22.515 --> 31:24.284
- WHERE DO YOU THINK AN OFFER
SHOULD GO IN THAT--

31:24.317 --> 31:26.753
WHAT WOULD IT SELL AT?
- I JUST WANT--OKAY, ZACH.

31:26.786 --> 31:28.355
FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW,
I'M USED TO, LIKE,

31:28.388 --> 31:31.391
WORKING FOR YOU
ALL THESE YEARS.

31:31.424 --> 31:32.992
YOU DO UNDERSTAND
I REPRESENT

31:33.093 --> 31:34.661
THE SELLER
IN THIS SITUATION?

31:34.694 --> 31:36.429
- I GOT IT.
- SECONDLY OF ALL,

31:36.463 --> 31:39.699
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW IT'S
GONNA BE FULL ASK OR NOTHING.

31:41.101 --> 31:44.137
- SO WE PUT IN
A FULL ASK OFFER.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.106
11 MILLION...

31:46.106 --> 31:48.008
FULLY FURNISHED.

31:48.108 --> 31:50.243
- NO. NO.
WE--I GOTTA KEEP THIS CLEAN.

31:50.276 --> 31:52.112
YOU'RE BUYING
THE APARTMENT 11 MILLION.

31:52.112 --> 31:54.180
THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
NEGOTIATE ALL THE OTHER THINGS.

31:54.214 --> 31:55.782
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU TRY TO GET
AS MUCH OF THE THINGS

31:55.815 --> 31:57.450
THAT ARE HERE AS POSSIBLE?

31:57.484 --> 31:58.852
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S
GONNA COMPLICATE THE DEAL.

31:58.885 --> 32:00.153
I WANT TO KEEP THEM SEPARATE.

32:00.186 --> 32:02.589
MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO SIGN
A CONTRACT VERY QUICKLY,

32:02.622 --> 32:04.824
CLEAN, 11 MILLION,
ON THE APARTMENT--

32:04.858 --> 32:06.326

I'LL TAKE IT FOR 11 MILLION

32:08.762 --> 32:11.064
FULLY FURNISHED.

32:11.064 --> 32:12.699
WITHOUT ANY FURNITURE.
YOU KNOW ME.

32:12.732 --> 32:14.267
DO I LOOK LIKE I'M--
- FREDRIK,

32:14.300 --> 32:15.468
IT'S A FULL PRICE OFFER.

32:15.502 --> 32:16.536
I DON'T WANT TO GO
BACK AND FORTH.

32:16.569 --> 32:18.138
IT'S A ONE-SHOT DEAL,

32:18.171 --> 32:19.873
AND I WANT TO GET IT
BEFORE IT GOES ON THE MARKET.

32:19.906 --> 32:21.074
- YOU WANT TO BUY IT
BEFORE IT HITS THE MARKET.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.275
- WRITE THE OFFER.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.777
AND LET'S GET AN ANSWER
FROM 'EM.

32:23.810 --> 32:24.978
- OKAY.

32:25.078 --> 32:26.079
I THINK THIS IS AN AMAZING DEAL

32:26.079 --> 32:27.881
FOR BOTH ZACH AND ZEKI.

32:27.914 --> 32:30.250
I JUST HOPE ZEKI REALIZES THAT.

32:30.283 --> 32:31.785
- IS THIS THE TUB YOU WERE--

32:31.818 --> 32:33.319
- OH, THE MASTER BATHROOM TUB,
YEAH.

32:33.353 --> 32:34.821
- I HOPE YOU DON'T DO THAT
IN OUR LISTINGS.

32:34.854 --> 32:37.223
- IT WORKED ON YOU.

32:43.830 --> 32:45.699
both: HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?

32:45.732 --> 32:47.133
- RYAN.
RYAN. HOW ARE YOU?

32:47.167 --> 32:48.268
- I'M GOOD, RYAN.
HOW ARE YOU?

32:48.301 --> 32:49.269
- HI. THANK YOU FOR COMING.

32:49.302 --> 32:51.171
- HI, RYAN.
HOW ARE YOU?

32:51.204 --> 32:53.406
- TODAY IS A GOOD DAY.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.809
I'M CLEARING OUT ALL THE BAD
ENERGY OUT OF THIS PLACE,

32:55.842 --> 32:58.278
AND I'VE GOT JUST
THE PEOPLE TO DO IT.

32:58.311 --> 33:00.613
I WOULDN'T SAY I'M, LIKE,
A SPIRITUAL PERSON.

33:00.647 --> 33:01.915
I MEAN, I THINK
SOMEWHERE INSIDE OF ME

33:01.948 --> 33:03.183
THERE'S PROBABLY A SPIRIT,

33:03.216 --> 33:05.218
AND IT'S PROBABLY
AN AWESOME ONE.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.287
BUT IN THIS HOUSE,
LIKE, THERE WAS--

33:07.320 --> 33:09.723
I--
IT JUST MADE ME FEEL WEIRD.

33:09.756 --> 33:11.224
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

33:11.257 --> 33:13.493
- WELL, WHERE ARE YOU FEELING
THE WEIRDEST?

33:13.526 --> 33:15.662
- UM, I GUESS WE'LL GO UPSTAIRS.

33:15.695 --> 33:17.330
DO YOU WANT TO GO THERE?
- LET'S CHECK THAT OUT.

33:17.364 --> 33:21.101
- THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM
WHERE IT'S ALWAYS COLD.

33:21.134 --> 33:23.536
FEEL IT.

33:26.539 --> 33:29.175
- YEAH, THERE'S LIKE A--

33:29.209 --> 33:31.277
A BREEZE RIGHT HERE.

33:31.311 --> 33:32.946
- BUT THE WINDOWS ARE CLOSED.

33:32.979 --> 33:35.348
- THERE'S DEFINITELY A WOMAN
THAT'S IN HERE.

33:35.382 --> 33:39.285
SHE'S, LIKE, ALMOST
LIKE THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

33:39.319 --> 33:40.820
[chuckles]

33:40.854 --> 33:43.323
- I MEAN, I'M NOT FEELING
ANYTHING NEFARIOUS.

33:43.356 --> 33:48.161
- SHE'S TELLING ME...
[giggles]

33:48.194 --> 33:50.864
- SO GLAD YOU'RE HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

33:50.897 --> 33:52.899
- THIS IS A DIFFERENT ENERGY.

33:52.932 --> 33:54.834
- WHAT I'M MOST WORRIED ABOUT

33:54.868 --> 33:57.203
IS THE BASEMENT.

33:57.237 --> 33:58.672
- ALL RIGHT, I'M A LOT SHORTER
THAN YOU,

33:58.705 --> 34:01.041
SO THAT'S--WOW.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.043
- OH, I SEE.

34:03.043 --> 34:04.110
- UM...

34:04.144 --> 34:06.312
WHY THE [bleep]
ARE THERE BABY MEN?

34:06.346 --> 34:08.548
- WOW, THIS IS STRANGE.

34:08.581 --> 34:11.184
THIS IS DIFFERENT.
THIS IS, LIKE, SCARY OVER HERE.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.055
- YOU'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO.

34:15.055 --> 34:16.656
- YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO PARTICIPATE

34:16.690 --> 34:18.525
IN A CLEANSING
OF THE PLACE.

34:18.558 --> 34:20.960
- EVEN THOUGH I STILL
DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS,

34:21.061 --> 34:23.263
I AM WILLING TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

34:23.296 --> 34:25.865
TO CLEANSE THIS HOUSE OF EVIL

34:25.899 --> 34:28.301
SO THAT I CAN JUST SELL IT
HAPPILY.

34:30.470 --> 34:32.072
- ANYTHING NEGATIVE

34:32.105 --> 34:34.808
OR DARK OR UNWELCOME
IS NO LONGER HERE.

34:34.841 --> 34:36.843
IT GOES OVER INTO THE LIGHT.
[bells clanging]

34:36.876 --> 34:39.546
- AND MAKE SURE YOU GET
ALL THE CORNERS.

34:39.579 --> 34:42.449
- AM I DOING OKAY?
[bells clanging]

34:42.482 --> 34:44.517
- THERE'S NO WRONG WAY
TO RING A BELL.

34:44.551 --> 34:47.087
- MAMA DONNA'S IDEA
OF GETTING THE GHOSTS AWAY

34:47.087 --> 34:49.389
IS TO ANNOY THE [bleep]
OUT OF THEM WITH A BELL.

34:49.422 --> 34:52.359
[clanging]

34:53.893 --> 34:56.229
IT LOOKS
LIKE A REALLY BIG JOINT.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.098
- [laughs]

35:00.467 --> 35:02.736
- OH, MY.

35:02.769 --> 35:05.672
- OH, SHE'S CRYING NOW.

35:05.705 --> 35:06.940
- I BLESS YOU, RYAN.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.376
I BLESS YOU WITH THE PURITY
OF YOUR INTENTION.

35:09.409 --> 35:12.912
I BLESS YOU.

35:12.946 --> 35:15.315
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

35:15.348 --> 35:17.050
- NOW THAT I'VE HAD
THE PLACE CLEANSED...

35:17.050 --> 35:18.284
- BLESS THIS HOUSE.

35:18.318 --> 35:20.387
- AND CLEANSED
AND CLEANSED...

35:20.420 --> 35:22.789
- ANYTHING NEGATIVE
HAS JUST SORT OF VANISHED.

35:22.822 --> 35:24.858
- I'M HOPING THAT THE GHOST
IS GONNA BE

35:24.891 --> 35:27.327
SO WEIRDED OUT
BY THESE PEOPLE

35:27.360 --> 35:29.396
THAT THEY WILL JUST LET ME
CLOSE IT.

35:29.429 --> 35:34.067
THE THINGS YOU DO
TO SELL A HOUSE, YOU KNOW?

35:39.072 --> 35:40.940
[cell phone ringing]

35:40.974 --> 35:44.077
- HELLO, IT'S LUIS.

35:44.077 --> 35:46.079

36:12.038 --> 36:13.840
AND, ONCE I GET
THE CONFIRMATION FROM HIM,

36:13.873 --> 36:16.343
WE'LL DRAW UP THE PAPERWORK
AND WRAP IT UP.

36:17.711 --> 36:22.782

CLOSING IN 45 DAYS.

37:26.946 --> 37:29.049
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME NOW.

37:29.049 --> 37:30.350
PEOPLE HIRE ME TO SELL
THEIR APARTMENTS EARLY,

37:30.383 --> 37:31.751
AND NOW THAT I SELL
THE APARTMENT EARLY,

37:31.785 --> 37:34.954
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SELL.

37:35.055 --> 37:36.790
I MEAN...

37:36.823 --> 37:39.959
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

37:40.060 --> 37:41.428
DO ME A FAVOR.
STAY THERE.

37:41.461 --> 37:43.730
I'M DRIVING.
I'M ON MY WAY TO YOU.

37:43.763 --> 37:44.831
WE'RE GONNA HAVE

37:44.864 --> 37:46.199
THIS CONVERSATION FACE-TO-FACE,
ALL RIGHT?

37:46.232 --> 37:50.136
WAIT FOR ME.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.511
- IT'S RAINING.

38:00.747 --> 38:03.016
[both exclaim]
OH, MY GOD.

38:03.049 --> 38:05.018
OH, MY GOD.
OKAY, THANK YOU, FERNANDO.

38:05.051 --> 38:06.686
I THINK THIS IS IT.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.022
[knock at door]

38:09.055 --> 38:10.824
ZEKI.

38:10.857 --> 38:12.492
YOUR HAIR
IS OUT OF CONTROL TODAY.

38:12.525 --> 38:13.827
- BIG AS ALWAYS.
- I LOVE IT.

38:13.860 --> 38:15.495
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY
IN SWEDEN,

38:15.528 --> 38:18.431
I DREAMED OF HAVING,
LIKE, REALLY CURLY HAIR.

38:18.465 --> 38:20.233
I'M ECSTATIC THAT ZACH
IS PUTTING IN AN OFFER

38:20.266 --> 38:21.868
FOR 101 WARREN.

38:21.901 --> 38:23.536
BUT NOW I HAVE TO SEE
IF ZEKI IS WILLING

38:23.570 --> 38:25.472
TO ACCEPT ZACH'S TERMS.

38:25.505 --> 38:26.940
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR ME?

38:27.040 --> 38:28.742
- YOU KNOW, THE LISTING'S
ABOUT TO GO LIVE.

38:28.775 --> 38:30.410
- YEAH.
- IT'S ACTUALLY INPUT

38:30.443 --> 38:32.045
INTO THE SYSTEM.

38:32.045 --> 38:33.646
BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED

38:33.680 --> 38:36.883
THAT MAKES ME SMILE.

38:38.685 --> 38:40.120
WE HAVE AN OFFER.
- REALLY?

38:40.153 --> 38:42.088
FOR HOW MUCH?

38:42.122 --> 38:43.923
- 11 MILLION.

38:43.957 --> 38:45.458
- OKAY.

38:45.492 --> 38:46.826
I'M EXCITED
ABOUT THE 11 MILLION,

38:46.860 --> 38:48.428
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
IT'S NOT EVEN LISTED YET.

38:48.461 --> 38:52.432
- I KNOW. I'VE BEEN CALLED
A MAGICIAN BEFORE.

38:52.465 --> 38:53.566
ANYWAY--
- TELL ME ABOUT THE OFFER.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.301
- ONE OF MY CLIENTS,

38:55.335 --> 38:57.303
VERY WEALTHY,
VERY SUCCESSFUL--

38:57.337 --> 39:00.407
IN FACT, IT'S A DEVELOPER
OF 11 NORTH MOORE.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.142
REMEMBER, THE REASON
WHY YOU CALLED ME TO BEGIN WITH.

39:02.175 --> 39:06.312
THE ONLY THING IS, HE WANTS
ALL THE FURNITURE INCLUDED.

39:09.015 --> 39:10.884
- NO.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO?

39:10.917 --> 39:12.686
- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

39:12.719 --> 39:15.388
11 MILLION
WITHOUT THE FURNITURE.

39:15.422 --> 39:16.856
OTHERWISE, WE LIST.

39:16.890 --> 39:18.591
- IT REALLY SCARES ME.
I'VE SEEN SO MANY DEALS

39:18.625 --> 39:22.429
FALL THROUGH BECAUSE PEOPLE
ARE FIGHTING OVER A DAMN SOFA.

39:22.462 --> 39:24.030
- FREDRIK, HERE IT IS.

39:24.064 --> 39:26.733
IF HE WANTS THE APARTMENT
FOR $11 MILLION,

39:26.766 --> 39:29.502
HE HAS TO HAVE IT
WITHOUT THE FURNITURE.

39:29.536 --> 39:34.240
- IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.
ZEKI AND ZACHI ARE SO CLOSE

39:34.274 --> 39:36.676
BUT STILL SO FAR AWAY.

39:36.710 --> 39:38.044
UNTIL A DEAL IS DONE,
IT'S NOT DONE,

39:38.044 --> 39:41.081
AND THIS ONE
IS DEFINITELY NOT DONE.

39:41.114 --> 39:44.351
- WHAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE
IS A FULL ASKING OFFER.

39:44.384 --> 39:46.052
WE MAY NEVER HAVE THAT AGAIN.

39:46.052 --> 39:48.054
- I'M EMOTIONALLY NOT READY.

39:56.062 --> 39:57.797
- SO WHEN I CALLED,
YOU WERE A LITTLE HESITANT

39:57.831 --> 39:59.766
WHEN I GAVE YOU
THE FULL ASKING OFFER.

39:59.799 --> 40:01.634
I FOUND SAM
IN BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK,

40:01.668 --> 40:03.837
WHICH IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE A LOT
OF PEOPLE COME TO REFLECT.

40:03.870 --> 40:06.139
I REALLY THINK THAT SAM
IS ABOUT TO PULL THE PLUG

40:06.172 --> 40:08.575
ON THIS DEAL
BECAUSE HE IS OVERWHELMED.

40:08.608 --> 40:10.343
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,

40:10.377 --> 40:13.013
YOU WERE SELLING YOUR APARTMENT
AT $100,000

40:13.046 --> 40:14.948
LESS THAN WHAT I PUT IT
ON THE MARKET FOR.

40:14.981 --> 40:18.118
AND SIX DAYS LATER,
I GIVE YOU A FULL ASKING OFFER,

40:18.151 --> 40:20.687
$100,000 MORE THAN YOU
ORIGINALLY WANTED TO.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.789
WHAT WE HAVE ON THE TABLE
IS A FULL ASKING OFFER

40:22.822 --> 40:25.058
FROM SOMEONE
THAT'S EXTREMELY QUALIFIED

40:25.091 --> 40:27.827
THAT IS WILLING TO CLOSE
IMMEDIATELY,

40:27.861 --> 40:30.063
AND WE MAY NEVER HAVE THAT
AGAIN.

40:30.096 --> 40:32.632
- BUT IT HAPPENED
REALLY FAST.

40:32.665 --> 40:36.169
AND, NOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING,

40:36.202 --> 40:38.872
YOU KNOW, I'M HAVING
A LITTLE BIT OF SECOND THOUGHT.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.676
I LOVE THIS CITY.

40:42.709 --> 40:46.146
THIS SPOT BRINGS BACK
SO MUCH MEMORIES FOR ME.

40:46.179 --> 40:48.114
MY WIFE AND I USED
TO SOMETIMES WALK

40:48.148 --> 40:51.785
OVER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE,
COME TO THE PIZZA PLACE,

40:51.818 --> 40:55.989
DECIDE ON WHAT TOPPINGS
WE WERE GONNA HAVE ON OUR PIZZA.

40:56.022 --> 40:58.258
- OH, REALLY? THAT'S AMAZING.
- YEAH.

40:58.291 --> 41:00.460
- I DO UNDERSTAND
WHERE SAM IS COMING FROM.

41:00.493 --> 41:03.063
THE CITY IS TRULY AMAZING
AND ROMANTIC.

41:03.063 --> 41:05.732
AND, EVEN WHEN IT'S TIME
TO LEAVE,

41:05.765 --> 41:08.435
IT'S VERY HARD TO LET IT GO.

41:08.468 --> 41:09.602
I UNDERSTAND
THE HESITATION.

41:09.636 --> 41:12.205
BUT, LISTEN,
IT'S ALL HERE, SAM,

41:12.238 --> 41:13.707
IN OUR HEADS.
- YEAH, EMOTIONAL.

41:13.740 --> 41:14.908
ABSOLUTELY.

41:14.941 --> 41:15.975
- YOU'VE BEEN WANTING

41:16.076 --> 41:17.310
TO MOVE TO SAN FRANCISCO.

41:17.344 --> 41:18.578
IF YOU LET YOURSELF HESITATE,

41:18.611 --> 41:20.347
YOU MAY NEVER MOVE THERE.
- RIGHT.

41:20.380 --> 41:21.815
- YOU KNOW?
YOU WANT TO WAIT TWO YEARS?

41:21.848 --> 41:23.216
MAYBE THAT'S ANOTHER TWO YEARS.

41:23.249 --> 41:25.552
IT'S ANOTHER TWO YEARS
OF YOUR LIFE.

41:25.585 --> 41:28.088
I THINK YOUR HEART
IS ALREADY IN SAN FRANCISCO.

41:28.088 --> 41:30.557
YOU JUST HAVE A HARD TIME
LETTING THIS CITY GO.

41:30.590 --> 41:33.426
YOUR COUCH HAS BEEN IN YOUR
LIVING ROOM FOR 15 YEARS.

41:42.602 --> 41:44.004
- NO, I SEE--
I SEE YOUR POINT.

41:44.104 --> 41:45.338
NO, UH...

41:47.841 --> 41:52.612
I THINK MY ANSWER IS...

41:52.645 --> 41:53.947
YES.

41:53.980 --> 41:55.415
- YES.
- SURE. YEAH.

41:55.448 --> 41:56.716
[laughter]
LET'S DO IT.

41:56.750 --> 41:58.685
- OH, MY GOD. COME HERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

41:58.718 --> 42:00.253
- THANKS.
WHAT A PLEASURE.

42:00.286 --> 42:01.621
- ABSOLUTELY.

42:01.654 --> 42:03.957
- NOW SAY GOOD-BYE.
- YUP.

42:04.057 --> 42:06.259
THIS CITY.

42:06.292 --> 42:07.494
- I'M GLAD THAT I COULD GIVE SAM
A HAPPY ENDING.

42:07.527 --> 42:08.795
NO, I DON'T MEAN THAT.
NO.

42:08.828 --> 42:10.764
I'M GLAD THAT SAM
HAD A HAPPY ENDING.

42:10.797 --> 42:12.065
NO!
HOLD ON.

42:12.098 --> 42:14.734
I'M GLAD THAT THIS WAS
A HAPPY ENDING

42:14.768 --> 42:16.069
FOR SAM.

42:16.069 --> 42:18.138
[laughs]

42:18.171 --> 42:19.472
WHY DON'T WE SAY
WE GRAB A PIZZA

42:19.506 --> 42:21.074
AND SHOW ME--
- ABSOLUTELY.

42:21.074 --> 42:22.475
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
ON YOUR PIZZA?

42:22.509 --> 42:23.677
- I DON'T KNOW.
PEPPERONI MAYBE?

42:23.710 --> 42:26.579
- PEPPERONI SOUNDS GOOD.

42:26.613 --> 42:28.748
- NEXT WEEK ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING: NEW YORK...</i>

42:28.782 --> 42:30.083
- YES.
THERE'S NOTHING

42:30.083 --> 42:32.686
A REAL ESTATE AGENT LIKES MORE
THAN TWO OFFERS

42:32.719 --> 42:34.320
ON THE SAME PLACE.

42:34.354 --> 42:36.089
BIDDING WAR, BITCHES.

42:36.122 --> 42:37.691

42:37.724 --> 42:39.092
ON A HIGH-END PROJECT
LIKE THIS...

42:39.092 --> 42:40.293
- COME ON IN.
- COULD BE GREAT

42:40.326 --> 42:42.562
FOR MY CAREER.
[murmurs]

42:42.595 --> 42:44.130
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

42:44.164 --> 42:46.666
- I TOLD BOTH OF YOU
THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS.

42:46.700 --> 42:48.268
START FIGHTING
OVER A DAMN RUG.

42:48.301 --> 42:50.103
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

42:50.103 --> 42:51.571
I'M IN SHOCK.

42:51.604 --> 42:53.940
I'M ABOUT TO LOSE THIS DEAL.

42:53.973 --> 42:55.909
- I DON'T HAVE TO MEET
YOUR FAMILY TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

42:55.942 --> 42:57.110
- THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

42:57.110 --> 42:58.178
- OKAY, SO IT DOESN'T WORK
FOR YOU.

42:58.211 --> 42:59.713
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

42:59.746 --> 43:01.281
