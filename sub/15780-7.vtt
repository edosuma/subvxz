WEBVTT

00:03.965 --> 00:07.093
Minions, your Baron has returned.

00:07.135 --> 00:09.968
All hail Baron Underbheit!

00:10.005 --> 00:13.873
I wish to be brought up to date
on all affairs of Underland.

00:13.909 --> 00:16.274
Catclops, what have you to report?

00:16.311 --> 00:19.178
Tourism has skyrocketed
at the Well of Bitter Sorrows...

00:19.214 --> 00:20.841
and Underbheit Birth Crevasse...

00:20.882 --> 00:24.147
since you enacted
the mandatory attendance edict.

00:24.186 --> 00:26.654
Told you. Girl Hitler?

00:26.688 --> 00:30.146
Benzine chewables have doubled
production in the child slave mines.

00:30.192 --> 00:33.127
Dilly-dallying saw a brief spike...

00:33.161 --> 00:36.619
but we stabilized it by removing the feet
of the alpha males...

00:36.665 --> 00:38.758
und the popular girls!

00:38.800 --> 00:43.100
Good. Good.
Manic Eightball, how are things in R&D?

00:46.808 --> 00:51.211
Excellent.
My friends, let us give a toast to me.

00:51.246 --> 00:54.841
You have all drunk deep of my cup
of villainous plenty.

00:54.883 --> 00:57.249
Perhaps too deep.

00:58.453 --> 01:02.412
It's come to my attention that each of you
at this hallowed table has betrayed me.

01:02.457 --> 01:04.084
- Sir, l...
- Silence!

01:04.125 --> 01:06.059
Your pleas for mercy will not be heard.

01:06.094 --> 01:10.224
I know all about the skimming off the top,
the planned coup d'etat...

01:10.265 --> 01:14.326
und, yes, the whispered comments
and poorly-drawn caricatures.

01:14.369 --> 01:15.893
You stand guilty.

01:15.937 --> 01:19.202
However, you all know me as a fair man.

01:19.241 --> 01:22.142
I see no reason why we can't simply
part ways amicably.

01:22.177 --> 01:25.510
I'll allow you to gracefully resign
your posts in the court of Underland...

01:25.547 --> 01:26.741
and that will be the end of it...

01:26.781 --> 01:29.545
and just to prove I hold no grudges...

01:29.584 --> 01:34.647
I have prepared a special parting gift
for each of you from my recent trip.

01:34.689 --> 01:37.886
If you'll kindly look beneath your chairs...

01:40.929 --> 01:43.989
Uh, Tiger Balm. I don't get it.

01:44.032 --> 01:48.594
Well, maybe he's saying he's sore at us,
and so he's giving us balm to soothe.

01:48.637 --> 01:51.299
That's retarded.
Sir, what exactly...

01:52.440 --> 01:53.805
Where'd he go?

01:53.842 --> 01:56.709
I knew it. I knew it.
He's gonna kill us, isn't he?

02:02.984 --> 02:05.612
Aw, crap!

02:10.258 --> 02:14.592
Shall I have the maintenance crew
clean the room, my master?

02:14.629 --> 02:17.257
No, not yet, manservant.

02:23.238 --> 02:26.139
Tiger bomb.

02:28.143 --> 02:31.670
A most thorough and decisive action,
your brilliance.

02:31.713 --> 02:36.548
You have eliminated all of the enemies
of Underland in one fell swoop.

02:36.584 --> 02:40.850
No, manservant, not all of them.

02:40.889 --> 02:43.790
One yet remains...

02:43.825 --> 02:46.259
Venture.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:38.680 --> 03:40.238
No.

03:40.281 --> 03:42.249
Brock, I'm begging you here.

03:42.283 --> 03:43.978
You couldn't pick a worse time for this.

03:44.019 --> 03:45.748
Same time every year.
You know that.

03:45.787 --> 03:48.051
I haven't finished the security system yet.

03:48.089 --> 03:49.249
What if something happens?

03:49.290 --> 03:51.485
We're naked in the breeze here.

03:51.526 --> 03:54.120
I left the number of the National Guard
on the fridge.

03:54.162 --> 03:56.062
You'll be fine.

03:56.097 --> 03:59.430
Bye, Brock.
Have fun on your sabotage.

03:59.467 --> 04:00.866
Sabbatical, doofus.

04:00.902 --> 04:02.631
Nice try, Hank.

04:02.670 --> 04:04.365
Come on. Get going.

04:04.406 --> 04:05.964
Aw, can't I come with?

04:06.007 --> 04:08.475
Sorry, Runs with Scissors.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.034
Need to do this alone.

04:10.078 --> 04:13.377
OK, Brock.
Hey, watch this.

04:15.350 --> 04:17.750
I almost got it down.

04:17.786 --> 04:20.721
That's real good, Hank.

04:20.755 --> 04:23.883
Hey, you hold the fort for me
while I'm gone, OK?

04:23.925 --> 04:25.984
You're the man of the house now.

04:26.027 --> 04:28.120
Brock, can't you wait just one more d...

04:33.435 --> 04:35.062
What the hell are you smiling about?

04:35.103 --> 04:37.264
Brock said I'm the man of the house
while he's gone.

04:37.305 --> 04:39.899
Oh, so you think
you're a big man now, huh?

04:39.941 --> 04:41.568
No... sir.

04:41.609 --> 04:43.634
Think you can take on your old dad, huh?

04:43.678 --> 04:46.078
I knew this day would come.
Go on, big man.

04:46.114 --> 04:47.308
Take your best shot.

04:47.348 --> 04:48.576
What do you mean, Pop?

04:48.616 --> 04:51.016
No! Stop it, you two!

04:51.052 --> 04:52.849
This family is tearing apart!

04:54.622 --> 04:56.351
You proud of yourself, big man?

04:56.391 --> 04:58.859
Look what you're doing
to your poor brother.

05:02.230 --> 05:03.754
Oh, what the hell?

05:08.436 --> 05:11.337
Sorry, sir. Road's closed by order
of the United States Army.

05:11.372 --> 05:13.397
I'm with the Office
of Secret Intelligence, soldier.

05:13.441 --> 05:14.931
What's all this?

05:14.976 --> 05:18.207
Sorry, sir. I wouldn't have expected you
in a civilian vehicle...

05:18.246 --> 05:19.679
not that it's not cherry, sir.

05:19.714 --> 05:21.272
I'll radio General Causeway to...

05:21.316 --> 05:23.284
No, no. I'm just here for R&R.

05:23.318 --> 05:26.253
Seriously, sir, if you just follow the flares
up this road...

05:26.287 --> 05:29.051
I wasn't joking.
You telling me I can't camp here, son?

05:29.090 --> 05:30.648
You mean, you're not here with the...

05:30.692 --> 05:32.557
You're here to camp?

05:32.594 --> 05:33.754
What's going on here?

05:35.830 --> 05:38.390
Routine exercises.

05:40.468 --> 05:43.198
Wait! Sir! Can I have your autograph?

05:43.238 --> 05:44.466
Who was that?

05:44.506 --> 05:46.531
Brock [Bleep]-ing Samson.

05:46.574 --> 05:49.008
No way! Dibs on his cigarette butt.

06:40.461 --> 06:41.928
No, no, no.

06:56.010 --> 06:58.478
Hey! What the hell are you doing here?

06:58.513 --> 07:02.176
It is you who has no right
to intrude on Underland business.

07:05.987 --> 07:08.251
Get off. Get off.

07:28.409 --> 07:29.842
What is this?

07:29.877 --> 07:33.040
Out front right now!

07:39.454 --> 07:41.820
Boys, wake up. We're being invad...

07:43.591 --> 07:45.559
Holy Toledo!
Pop's in trouble!

07:57.772 --> 07:59.296
What do you dicks want?

07:59.340 --> 08:01.604
The butterfly people will leave at once...

08:01.643 --> 08:05.636
that we may slay the Dr. Venture
in the name of the Underland.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.874
Jeez, they're really cut.

08:06.914 --> 08:08.973
Shut up. No way!

08:09.017 --> 08:12.282
We're under orders from the Monarch
to kill Venture ourselves.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.053
But we're supposed to bring back
his mandible as a souvenir for our lord.

08:17.091 --> 08:21.619
Shush! Never share the details
of our master's plan with outsiders.

08:21.663 --> 08:24.291
All right. Look. I got to call this in
to headquarters.

08:24.332 --> 08:27.301
You clowns call your guy
and meet us back here.

08:28.670 --> 08:31.639
Ja. All right...

08:31.673 --> 08:33.640
but not because you say so.

08:33.674 --> 08:34.869
- Why?
- We're too late!

08:34.909 --> 08:37.639
Pop's been stung
by a tarantula and a scorpion.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.341
- He's delirious.
- Holy crap, what do we do?

08:40.381 --> 08:44.909
The first thing you do is tie a tourniquet
to stop the toxins from reaching his brain.

08:44.952 --> 08:46.112
Check.

08:46.154 --> 08:49.248
While I do that, you go to the lab and see
if there's any antivenom in the first-aid kit.

08:49.290 --> 08:52.589
Good thinking.
Um, where are we, anyway?

08:52.627 --> 08:55.152
I don't know, but that looks like a door.

08:57.332 --> 08:59.163
Hey, the lab's right here.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.599
When did dad build this?

09:00.635 --> 09:03.160
- Time's a-wastin', Deano.
- Right.

09:10.578 --> 09:12.944
Halt! Who goes there?

09:12.980 --> 09:15.608
Pop, you're al...

09:15.650 --> 09:18.915
Intruder! Intruder!

09:25.158 --> 09:28.594
You are trespassing
on Venture Industries property.

09:28.629 --> 09:31.655
Prepare to be destroyed.

09:35.035 --> 09:37.833
Hank! What are you doing?
Knock it off!

09:37.871 --> 09:40.965
This Freudian phase of yours
has gone too far, mister.

09:41.008 --> 09:42.305
You're ground...

09:43.410 --> 09:44.809
What the hell was that?

09:44.845 --> 09:46.312
Destroy intruder.

09:46.346 --> 09:48.940
Destroy intruder.

09:48.982 --> 09:50.381
I live here!

09:50.417 --> 09:53.386
Leave me alone!

09:53.420 --> 09:55.911
Something out there,
and it's made of metal,

09:55.956 --> 09:58.948
And it has Dad's face,
and it wants to beat me up.

09:58.992 --> 10:01.119
This is just like my dream.

10:01.161 --> 10:02.924
Yeah, but did you get the first-aid kit?

10:02.963 --> 10:04.521
I don't need first aid, Hank.

10:04.565 --> 10:07.625
I need you to stop choking me
and hitting me with fire extinguishers.

10:07.668 --> 10:09.295
But, Pop, you're bleeding.

10:09.336 --> 10:11.736
Oh, this. Uh, no.

10:11.772 --> 10:15.264
It's fairly common for some men
to lactate involuntarily...

10:15.309 --> 10:17.641
in situations of extreme stress.

10:19.346 --> 10:21.211
Dean's lactating, too.

10:24.017 --> 10:26.485
Oh, somebody loves the Monarch.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.284
Monarch speaking.

10:29.323 --> 10:31.188
What?

10:31.224 --> 10:34.022
Well, slay him.
What's the problem?

10:35.696 --> 10:36.890
How many?

10:36.930 --> 10:38.955
Underbheit? Of all the...

10:38.999 --> 10:40.967
No, no. Just sit tight, Twenty-four.

10:41.001 --> 10:42.662
I'll call a sit-down.

10:42.703 --> 10:45.695
Nobody is to make a move
until I've had it out with Underbheit.

10:45.739 --> 10:48.708
- Unbelievable.
- What?

10:48.742 --> 10:50.175
Get Baron Underbheit on the phone.

10:50.210 --> 10:53.008
- Why? What's going on?
- Just do it, woman! Man!

10:53.046 --> 10:55.514
Do it yourself, Mr. Big Pants.

10:57.384 --> 10:59.443
Fine.

10:59.486 --> 11:01.977
Wait a minute.
How do I get an...

11:02.022 --> 11:04.183
outside line?

11:12.366 --> 11:14.994
Who's there?
Identify yourself.

11:23.043 --> 11:25.637
Intruder. Kill intruder.

11:25.679 --> 11:27.169
Not to worry, boys.

11:27.214 --> 11:29.341
That door is eight inches
of tempered steel.

11:29.383 --> 11:30.645
We're perfectly safe here.

11:30.684 --> 11:32.049
Intruder. Kill.

11:32.085 --> 11:33.518
Let's not test it, Hank.

11:33.553 --> 11:34.815
He's made out of the same stuff.

11:34.855 --> 11:37.847
- What does it want?
- His name is G.U.A.R.D.O...

11:37.891 --> 11:40.951
and I designed him
to protect us while Brock's away.

11:40.994 --> 11:43.189
Then why did he try to break my face?

11:43.230 --> 11:45.926
Because I haven't programmed it
into his friendly file yet.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.433
I fell asleep.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.867
Right now, G.U.A.R.D.O.
Doesn't know you or I...

11:49.903 --> 11:53.361
from an army of snake people
hopped up on PCP.

11:53.407 --> 11:56.205
But hey, that's what
a panic room is for, right?

11:56.243 --> 11:59.474
We'll be fine if we stay here
till Brock shows up.

11:59.513 --> 12:01.378
Brock. Come in, Brock.

12:01.415 --> 12:03.315
G.U.A.R.D.O?
Hey, does that stand for something?

12:06.219 --> 12:07.652
Hello. It's Doc.

12:07.688 --> 12:10.486
Come on. It's an emergency,
and I can't get to the fridge.

12:13.860 --> 12:17.318
Those are for company.
He's late.

12:17.364 --> 12:19.127
Royalty. That's how they are.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.992
What is this, diet?

12:22.035 --> 12:23.229
Why did you get diet?

12:23.270 --> 12:25.170
- I didn't.
- Taste this, then.

12:26.707 --> 12:29.574
OK. I might have grabbed the wrong bottle
at the supermarket.

12:29.609 --> 12:32.339
How do you do that?
How can you not tell the difference?

12:32.379 --> 12:34.574
God, it's like having my dad
do the shopping.

12:34.614 --> 12:37.082
- He's here.
- Places, everyone, places.

12:44.257 --> 12:45.417
Now!

13:15.522 --> 13:16.989
All right, all right.
Knock it off.

13:17.023 --> 13:18.718
We tried. Whatever.

13:18.759 --> 13:20.488
Is it over?

13:20.527 --> 13:21.960
You can come out now. We're done.

13:23.029 --> 13:25.361
You are supposed
to stay on your side!

13:25.398 --> 13:28.162
Yeah. Look.
It's probably gonna be a while here...

13:28.201 --> 13:32.194
and we got some beers and stuff
over at the Monarch-mobile, so I thought...

14:02.502 --> 14:05.130
Don't you lay a hand on my Sasquatch!

14:12.646 --> 14:14.978
Why don't you government bastards
leave us in peace?

14:15.015 --> 14:16.482
I'm not here with the government.

14:16.516 --> 14:18.143
- I just want to...
- Don't you lie to me.

14:18.185 --> 14:19.652
I know who you are.

14:19.686 --> 14:21.677
You're Brock Samson.
You're with O.S.I.

14:27.294 --> 14:28.488
Bionic, huh?

14:28.528 --> 14:30.393
Let's see how bionic.

14:32.098 --> 14:35.124
Right in my Cape Canaverals.

14:35.168 --> 14:36.829
Wait a minute.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.531
I know you, too.

14:38.572 --> 14:41.006
You're Steve Summers, astronaut.

14:41.041 --> 14:43.509
- Former astronaut.
- I thought you died.

14:43.543 --> 14:45.374
That's what everyone was meant to think.

14:45.412 --> 14:49.007
True, I was barely alive
after my test ship broke up...

14:49.049 --> 14:50.516
but the army saved me.

14:50.550 --> 14:54.350
They spent six million dollars
to give me all-new bionic parts.

14:54.387 --> 14:57.413
Made me stronger, better,
faster than I was.

14:57.457 --> 15:00.119
Then you know what they did?
They put me to work.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.151
They expected me to pay it all back.

15:02.195 --> 15:06.393
Do you have any idea how long
six million bucks takes to pay off...

15:06.433 --> 15:08.060
on a government salary?

15:08.101 --> 15:11.036
And these are our holding cells.

15:11.071 --> 15:13.972
I'm sure Underland
has much larger ones...

15:14.007 --> 15:16.305
you being a whole country and all.

15:16.343 --> 15:18.607
Underland has no prisons.

15:18.645 --> 15:20.840
Really? How progressive.

15:20.881 --> 15:25.944
The master has instated the death penalty
for all infractions of Underlaw.

15:25.986 --> 15:28.318
You have to give me this one.

15:28.355 --> 15:30.721
I've loathed Venture ever since college.

15:30.757 --> 15:32.486
Oh, who hasn't, Underpants?

15:32.525 --> 15:34.117
What makes your case so special?

15:35.695 --> 15:37.856
Wow. You mean, he did that? How?

15:37.898 --> 15:42.335
Where I come from,
a lab partnership is a sacred trust.

15:42.369 --> 15:46.999
One is always supposed to look out
for one's lab partner.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.507
Venture did not.

15:48.541 --> 15:51.772
Fine, fine, but you have to understand.
You can't waltz into the middle...

15:51.811 --> 15:53.176
of a delicate, high-stakes
chess tournament...

15:53.213 --> 15:55.909
and yell "king me"
just because he bitched up your face.

15:55.949 --> 15:58.679
Venture and I have been engaged
in a deadly game...

15:58.718 --> 16:00.913
of cat and also cat for years.

16:00.954 --> 16:02.785
Allow me to enlighten you.

16:02.822 --> 16:04.756
Behold!

16:04.791 --> 16:09.785
But a small glimpse into the genius
that is my 37-point on-going plan...

16:09.829 --> 16:12.297
to ruin Dr. Venture's life.

16:12.332 --> 16:14.459
Nope. That's my resume. Hold on.

16:15.835 --> 16:17.132
Damn it!

16:17.170 --> 16:19.035
Oh, hang on a second.

16:20.607 --> 16:22.131
No, no. Let me...

16:22.175 --> 16:24.166
Here. Let me just reboot this.

16:29.182 --> 16:31.275
I... Have a lot of extensions.

16:31.318 --> 16:33.149
Destroy.

16:33.186 --> 16:34.778
Destroy intruders.

16:34.821 --> 16:37.085
Man. Enough already. We get it.

16:37.123 --> 16:39.091
Listen, boys.
Brock is still not answering.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.649
It's too bad H.E.L.P.eR. Isn't here...

16:40.694 --> 16:42.594
to teach this bucket of bolts
some manners.

16:42.629 --> 16:44.824
H.E.L.P.eR. is a real robot.

16:44.864 --> 16:46.855
H.E.L.P.eR. Of course.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.993
H.E.L.P.eR.
Come in, H.E.L.P.eR.

16:49.035 --> 16:51.060
H.E.L.P.eR.
Can you read me?

16:53.673 --> 16:55.538
Oh, where is he now?

16:55.575 --> 16:57.941
Maybe H.E.L.P.eR.
got jealous of your new robot...

16:57.978 --> 16:59.138
and he's mad at you.

16:59.179 --> 17:00.874
Oh, of all the ridiculous...

17:00.914 --> 17:03.075
Robots don't have fee...

17:07.420 --> 17:10.946
H.E.L.P.eR?
Listen to me.

17:10.991 --> 17:13.289
I'm sorry.

17:14.728 --> 17:16.627
I need...

17:16.663 --> 17:19.655
Rusty needs your help.

17:23.502 --> 17:27.803
When they closed the plant,
there weren't a lot of jobs for me.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.469
All I got is a G.E.D.

17:30.510 --> 17:31.977
It was either this or the army.

17:32.012 --> 17:35.311
In Underland, all citizens are required
to serve in his lordship's infantry...

17:35.348 --> 17:37.407
from the ages of twelve to thirty-seven.

17:37.450 --> 17:40.146
At thirty-eight, we are executed.

17:40.186 --> 17:43.713
When I met the Monar',
I was hooked on cra' 'ocaine.

17:43.757 --> 17:46.191
I get in all kind of trouble.

17:46.226 --> 17:48.421
Monarch turn my life around.

17:48.461 --> 17:50.656
How about you?
Why'd you join up?

17:50.697 --> 17:53.188
You guys kidnapped me when I was fifteen.

18:02.008 --> 18:04.977
Personally, I like the discipline.

18:05.011 --> 18:08.105
Plus, it's a great way to see Underland.

18:08.148 --> 18:11.140
You know what?
Let's have some real fun.

18:11.184 --> 18:12.708
So what, we can't get in there?

18:12.752 --> 18:14.583
Let's do some damage anyway.

18:17.023 --> 18:21.221
And that's when I met
my little Sasburger here.

18:21.261 --> 18:24.389
Well, cupid must've been
using bionic arrows that day...

18:24.431 --> 18:27.229
because I took one look
in those big, blue eyes...

18:27.267 --> 18:29.861
and I knew I couldn't go
through with my mission...

18:29.903 --> 18:32.030
or any mission ever again.

18:32.072 --> 18:36.873
The army might've given me a new body,
but Sasquatch gave me a new life.

18:38.344 --> 18:39.902
We've been on the run ever since.

18:43.416 --> 18:45.509
They're coming.
Don't worry, baby.

18:45.552 --> 18:46.985
I'm not gonna let them get you.

18:47.020 --> 18:48.647
You better get out of here, Samson.

18:48.688 --> 18:50.815
This might get ugly,
and you're still with the Agency.

18:50.857 --> 18:52.017
Now wait a minute.

18:52.058 --> 18:53.389
I have a better idea. Come here.

18:53.426 --> 18:55.155
This is your bionic one, right?

18:56.563 --> 19:00.693
That was hooked up to my brain.

19:00.733 --> 19:02.758
Better lose the bright red tracksuit, too.

19:02.802 --> 19:05.202
- But that's my thing.
- As for you...

19:05.238 --> 19:07.035
No! Wait!
What are you doing?

19:15.348 --> 19:17.441
OK. Are you there, H.E.L.P.eR?

19:18.451 --> 19:21.614
Now, what you want to do
is plug directly into the primary CPU.

19:21.654 --> 19:25.055
Once you do that,
you'll be able to reboot the system.

19:25.091 --> 19:28.288
Once it reboots, enter the...

19:30.964 --> 19:33.125
It worked.
G.U.A.R.D.O.'s leaving.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.463
H.E.L.P.eR. did it!

19:34.501 --> 19:37.095
Go, Team H.E.L.P.eR!

19:38.404 --> 19:41.237
We're in. All right, henchmen. This is it.

19:41.274 --> 19:42.866
Let's get that bastard!

19:46.813 --> 19:49.907
Halt! Identify yourselves.

19:49.949 --> 19:53.180
Intruders.
Intruders. Destroy.

19:55.255 --> 19:57.815
Oh, it's good to see you again, Mr. Samson.

19:57.857 --> 20:00.485
You got some, uh... friends?

20:00.527 --> 20:03.052
Just some buddies from my old unit.

20:03.096 --> 20:05.587
They do this every year.

20:05.632 --> 20:07.395
You ever seen heavy combat, son?

20:07.433 --> 20:10.061
You should look so good
after stepping on a land mine.

20:10.103 --> 20:11.832
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

20:11.871 --> 20:14.499
Go on ahead.

20:14.541 --> 20:16.168
What are you doing?
Why'd you let him go?

20:16.209 --> 20:18.643
What? It's just a bunch of vets camping.

20:18.678 --> 20:23.115
Dude, that was a shaved Bigfoot
and Steve Summers in a wig...

20:23.149 --> 20:25.947
made out of shaved Bigfoot.

20:28.254 --> 20:29.687
That was close.

20:29.722 --> 20:31.053
Thanks, Brock.

20:31.090 --> 20:33.285
You can drop us off at the bus station.

20:33.326 --> 20:35.260
Sasquatch has family up in Canada.

20:35.295 --> 20:37.855
We'll probably head up there.

20:37.897 --> 20:42.061
You could've told me
Sasquatch was a...

20:42.101 --> 20:43.363
a dude.

20:44.571 --> 20:47.870
- You couldn't tell?
- Not until I had to...

20:47.907 --> 20:49.374
shave him.

20:49.409 --> 20:50.671
What are you, shy?

20:50.710 --> 20:53.201
Sasquatch doesn't have anything
you haven't seen before.

20:53.246 --> 20:56.181
Sasquatch is something
I haven't seen before!

20:56.216 --> 20:58.912
Well, that's a fantastic idea,
Underbheit...

20:58.952 --> 21:00.476
a team-up.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.988
Well, I couldn't have thought of it
without your input.

21:03.022 --> 21:05.490
Don't we need to file
an Article of Collusion...

21:05.525 --> 21:09.484
with the Guild of Calamitous Intent first?

21:12.699 --> 21:15.327
You're right.
Screw protocol.

21:15.368 --> 21:16.995
Go ahead and call them.

21:18.204 --> 21:20.172
Oh, the henchmen are going to be thrilled.

21:20.206 --> 21:21.571
They're not answering.

21:27.547 --> 21:29.742
What the f...

21:34.254 --> 21:35.551
Intruder.

22:07.387 --> 22:09.514
Come on, H.E.L.P.eR.
I apologized.

22:09.555 --> 22:10.749
What more do you want?

22:13.259 --> 22:14.556
Oh, damn it!

22:15.828 --> 22:17.728
That's good soup.
