WEBVTT

00:18.931 --> 00:21.108
Give me the money.
Give me the money.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.370
Empty it out.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.633
Hurry up, hurry up!

00:24.633 --> 00:27.288
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.159
All of it.
Put the money in the bag.

00:29.159 --> 00:30.552
Put the money in the bag,
come on.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.032
- Take it easy, huh?
- What're you doing?

00:32.032 --> 00:33.468
I'm just getting a bag, okay?

00:33.468 --> 00:34.947
All of it.
Put the money in the bag.

00:34.947 --> 00:37.515
Come on.
Hurry up, I need table six.

00:38.734 --> 00:39.996
Hey! Get back! Get back!

00:41.389 --> 00:42.520
Get down!

00:51.616 --> 00:53.575
There's a male with a gun,
shooting people

00:53.575 --> 00:56.099
at the Bel Aire Diner
on 21st Street.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.580
Early 20s, gray hooded
sweatshirt and jeans.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.409
Greatest superhero,
including Marvel and DC?

01:01.409 --> 01:03.759
- Mm-hmm.
- Got to say Spider-Man.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.369
Aw, Peter Parker's flawed.

01:05.369 --> 01:06.979
That's what
I like about him.

01:06.979 --> 01:08.938
He makes mistakes,
but he has good intentions.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.157
Plus he's
a native New Yorker.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.549
I'll give you that.

01:11.549 --> 01:12.942
Spidey represents.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.639
But he's a one-woman man.

01:14.639 --> 01:16.467
I don't think
you have that in common.

01:16.467 --> 01:19.253
That's only because I haven't
met my Mary Jane yet.

01:19.253 --> 01:21.603
- Oh.
- Okay, what about you?

01:21.603 --> 01:23.126
Wonder Woman.

01:23.126 --> 01:24.954
She's hot, but come on,

01:24.954 --> 01:26.347
what kind of superpowers
does she actually have?

01:26.347 --> 01:30.220
Uh, just superhuman
strength and speed. Hello?

01:30.220 --> 01:34.355
Plus she's got cool boots
and magic bracelets.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.008
I do dig that
golden lasso.

01:37.314 --> 01:38.272
Oh, my God!

01:38.272 --> 01:40.665
Hey.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.972
Police! Police!
Clear the way, clear the way.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.017
Everyone back up.
Clear the way. Back up.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.715
She was shoved in to traffic.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.064
We're going to
take care of you, okay?

01:48.064 --> 01:49.587
But you can't move.

01:49.587 --> 01:51.589
Central, 2-9,
we are requesting a bus

01:51.589 --> 01:53.678
at 13th and Washington.
I have a woman

01:53.678 --> 01:55.158
struck by a car
at this location.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.812
What happened?

01:56.812 --> 01:58.857
Out of nowhere,
this crazy guy just shoved her.

01:58.857 --> 01:59.945
Did you get
a good look at him?

01:59.945 --> 02:01.686
He was in his, uh, 20s,

02:01.686 --> 02:03.601
uh, green sweatshirt, jeans.

02:03.601 --> 02:04.907
Which way did he go?

02:04.907 --> 02:06.561
He ran that way,
laughing the whole time.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.918
Baez. Hey, Danny.

02:16.919 --> 02:19.313
Hope this isn't gonna
become a habit.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.489
- Nice to see you, too.
- Well, what do we got?

02:21.489 --> 02:23.882
I've got a series
of robberies in the 2-9

02:23.882 --> 02:25.101
targeting young women.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.972
This fits the pattern.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.496
Young women being robbed
is part of a pattern?

02:28.496 --> 02:30.062
Well, two perps
in broad daylight,

02:30.062 --> 02:31.586
grabbing high-end bags,

02:31.586 --> 02:33.153
and then assaulting
the vic is the pattern.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.328
Yeah, well, sounds like
every other robbery

02:34.328 --> 02:35.981
on this street to me.

02:35.981 --> 02:38.549
I think we can handle it
without a babysitter. Thank you.

02:38.549 --> 02:39.724
Doesn't have to
be a fight, Danny.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.291
If it was a fight, you'd know.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.075
All right.
Look, who's the vic?

02:43.075 --> 02:45.513
Grace Mitchell, Adam Reynolds.

02:45.513 --> 02:46.905
They're boyfriend
and girlfriend.

02:46.905 --> 02:49.604
They were both
robbed and assaulted?

02:49.604 --> 02:51.127
No, she was robbed
by the two guys,

02:51.127 --> 02:52.433
he tried to step in,
he got assaulted, too.

02:52.433 --> 02:55.218
Great. Can we take it
from here, boss?

02:55.218 --> 02:56.741
Looking forward to not
working with you.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.265
Same.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.878
Excuse me.
Hey, can we have a word?

03:02.878 --> 03:04.184
Sorry, no can do.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.576
We need to
transport them ASAP.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.751
What hospital?

03:06.751 --> 03:08.057
St. Benjamin's.

03:08.057 --> 03:10.364
If this is
stranger on stranger,

03:10.364 --> 03:13.149
the city is worse off
than I thought.

03:17.153 --> 03:19.242
Call came in
approximately 7:35 hours.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.504
We responded immediately,

03:20.504 --> 03:22.419
but she was DOA
when we got here.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.942
Who called it in?

03:23.942 --> 03:25.727
The witness.
Sophia Abetemarco.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.946
15 years old.
She's kind of shell-shocked.

03:27.946 --> 03:29.252
She hasn't given
a statement or anything.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.558
Where is she now?

03:30.558 --> 03:32.473
She's outside on
the back of the bus.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.214
Any other witnesses?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.911
Just her. She was
getting a private lesson.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.304
No other students around.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.962
Anthony, I came
as soon as I heard.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.268
Is she okay?

03:45.268 --> 03:46.704
No, she's not okay.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.750
Her ballet teacher,
Miss Patty,

03:48.750 --> 03:49.925
was gunned down
right in front of her.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.056
Is she hurt?

03:51.056 --> 03:52.623
Not wounds you could see.

03:54.451 --> 03:57.454
Hi, Sophia,
how're you doing?

03:57.454 --> 03:58.673
Are you okay?

03:58.673 --> 04:01.458
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.069
Did you happen to see anything?

04:04.069 --> 04:05.723
Um, I...

04:05.723 --> 04:07.116
No, she didn't see anything.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.424
Okay. Well, maybe
we can let Sophia answer?

04:10.424 --> 04:11.729
Maybe you didn't hear me, Erin.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.383
She didn't see anything.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.820
- Dad?
- Uh...

04:15.820 --> 04:17.779
Hey, Malone, can you
help me out over here?

04:17.779 --> 04:20.434
Can you, uh, stand up
and take your jacket off for me?

04:20.434 --> 04:22.697
And then we'll
give it to the officer.

04:22.697 --> 04:26.004
Here. Now you got
everything you need.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.269
I'm taking Sophia home.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.792
Anthony, uh...

04:30.792 --> 04:33.316
Come on. The car's over there.
Goodbye, Erin.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.240
Officer Hayes.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.546
Commissioner.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.069
Have a seat.

04:50.202 --> 04:52.640
DCPI Garrett Moore.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.990
Yes, sir.
I've seen you on the news.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.861
And I'm Lieutenant Gormley.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.472
Thanks for coming up so quickly.

04:58.472 --> 05:00.822
As you know,
I gave a full statement

05:00.822 --> 05:02.040
to the detectives who responded.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.390
Yeah, we talked to those guys,

05:03.390 --> 05:05.174
and we watched
the security footage.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.132
So, you saw he had a gun,

05:07.132 --> 05:08.569
started shooting it
without warning.

05:08.569 --> 05:12.137
We did. And you were off duty.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.530
- I was.
- But the guy

05:13.530 --> 05:15.271
didn't come in shooting,
though, right?

05:15.271 --> 05:18.143
He went to the register first,
and he told the owner

05:18.143 --> 05:20.015
- to empty the drawer.
- Yes.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.496
And you observed
that going down?

05:23.453 --> 05:24.933
I did.

05:24.933 --> 05:29.111
Could you walk us through
what you did to stop it?

05:29.111 --> 05:30.721
As I said in my report,

05:30.721 --> 05:32.593
I just figured
I'd let the crime go down,

05:32.593 --> 05:34.246
give a good description after

05:34.246 --> 05:36.292
to minimize
people from getting hurt.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.251
Well, once he opened fire,

05:39.251 --> 05:41.689
I'm not sure who
you were protecting

05:41.689 --> 05:43.386
by not getting involved.

05:43.386 --> 05:46.346
The report
indicates you were armed.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.653
Yes, but I was afraid
if I fired,

05:49.653 --> 05:51.525
I might hit
an innocent bystander.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.396
So instead you let
one civilian die,

05:53.396 --> 05:55.616
two others are clinging
to life in the ICU,

05:55.616 --> 05:57.487
one a 12-year-old boy.

06:00.751 --> 06:04.146
I've said all there is
to say in my report.

06:06.714 --> 06:10.239
That's all, Officer Hayes.
You're dismissed.

06:19.117 --> 06:22.164
His answers
are totally unacceptable.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.776
Ask Baker to come in.

06:25.776 --> 06:30.433
I want to take a hard look at
that surveillance footage again.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.913
I think we got a problem.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.722
I was walking towards
the High Line,

06:58.722 --> 07:00.898
and out of nowhere,
this guy just pushed me,

07:00.898 --> 07:02.596
full force, into traffic.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.032
Do you remember
anything else?

07:04.032 --> 07:05.642
I remember hitting
the hood of the car.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.296
Would you be able
to describe him?

07:07.296 --> 07:09.298
No. Honestly, I was too busy

07:09.298 --> 07:10.908
taking in the buildings and all.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.475
I had just arrived
an hour before,

07:12.475 --> 07:15.565
unpacked my bags
and walked out to see the city.

07:15.565 --> 07:18.525
I'm so sorry
this happened to you.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.091
From the time I was five,

07:20.091 --> 07:22.920
I've wanted to come
to New York City.

07:22.920 --> 07:26.054
This is my graduation present
from my parents.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.316
You're here
by yourself?

07:27.316 --> 07:29.318
I have friends here.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.451
I was supposed to meet them
in the Village for drinks,

07:31.451 --> 07:34.062
but I told them
I couldn't make it.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.107
Well, is there anyone
we can call for you?

07:36.107 --> 07:39.502
Can you call me a cab to take
me back to Albuquerque?

07:39.502 --> 07:42.462
Well, your injuries
are minor at least.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.333
So you can still enjoy
the rest of your trip.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.813
Are you serious?

07:45.813 --> 07:47.162
I don't want to go anywhere

07:47.162 --> 07:49.947
except home and away from here.

07:49.947 --> 07:52.515
I never want to come here again.

07:55.518 --> 07:58.303
I know, you could write
an interim order,

07:58.303 --> 08:01.350
call it the "Hero Clause."

08:01.350 --> 08:02.525
That ought to
get people lining up

08:02.525 --> 08:04.266
to put their life on the line

08:04.266 --> 08:05.789
every hour of every day

08:05.789 --> 08:09.184
at a starting salary of 45,000.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.621
I think the guy
should get a serious rip.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.058
I think he should be
sent for retraining.

08:14.058 --> 08:17.932
Well, I think
he should be fired.

08:17.932 --> 08:20.238
Well, clearly,
I'm in the minority here.

08:20.238 --> 08:21.501
You got that right.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.503
I'm not one for fantasy.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.461
I prefer my feet firmly planted.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.984
What're you
talking about?

08:26.984 --> 08:28.377
Well, while you all weigh in

08:28.377 --> 08:29.813
on what should happen
to Officer Hayes,

08:29.813 --> 08:31.032
you ought to go back and read

08:31.032 --> 08:32.686
the Active Shooter Manual again.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.993
It only mentions
on-duty personnel.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.213
There's no decision to make
about Officer Hayes

08:38.213 --> 08:41.521
because, technically,
he did nothing wrong.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.001
Give me a break, Garrett.
He's a coward.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.395
Morally? Ethically?
Maybe you have a point.

08:46.395 --> 08:49.398
Legally? Procedurally? None.

08:49.398 --> 08:53.663
Why am I the only one
willing to acknowledge this?

08:53.663 --> 08:56.492
I'm not a cop. I'm sorry,

08:56.492 --> 08:58.581
I missed the secret
handshake on the way in.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.540
Please,
let's not go there again.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.760
Sid, Abigail, give us the room.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.463
You've got something
to say, say it.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.769
I believe I did.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.859
I'm just trying to keep you

09:15.859 --> 09:18.296
from firing someone
without due cause,

09:18.296 --> 09:20.385
and keeping your response
to the press on point.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.039
My response to the press is:

09:22.039 --> 09:24.041
Officer Hayes
dishonored his shield

09:24.041 --> 09:26.435
and will be fired
for dereliction of duty.

09:26.435 --> 09:29.046
- Really, Frank?
- That is my opinion.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.134
You can't have
an opinion.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.049
This is about facts,

09:32.049 --> 09:37.098
not about how you feel
about Officer Hayes' actions.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.623
I might not be a cop,

09:40.623 --> 09:43.321
but I know
how to separate the two.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.373
Excuse me. Detective Reagan.

09:51.373 --> 09:53.070
This is my partner
Detective Baez.

09:53.070 --> 09:54.942
We were wondering if we
could ask you some questions

09:54.942 --> 09:57.205
about the men who robbed
and assaulted you.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.426
Yeah, sure.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.515
There was...

10:03.515 --> 10:05.082
There was two of them.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.823
Both wearing baseball caps.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.825
Did they refer
to each other by name,

10:08.825 --> 10:12.350
or have any distinguishing
features or marks?

10:12.350 --> 10:16.485
Um, they were both
in their late 20s, early 30s.

10:16.485 --> 10:19.662
One Hispanic,
one African-American.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.664
I'd just paid the bill.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.231
We'd just finished breakfast,

10:23.231 --> 10:25.668
and I was just waiting
for the credit card back.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.279
And I told Adam
I'd meet him outside.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.891
It's a nice neighborhood,
I wanted some air.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.980
I had just got to the car

10:32.980 --> 10:34.111
when one of them
came up behind me

10:34.111 --> 10:38.115
and, um, grabbed me and...

10:38.115 --> 10:39.551
He tried to take my purse.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.031
Did they have any weapons?

10:41.031 --> 10:43.338
I don't know.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.340
He just said,
"Give me your bag, bitch."

10:45.340 --> 10:47.124
And I said, "No."

10:47.124 --> 10:50.171
Why should I hand over
everything to that punk?

10:50.171 --> 10:52.695
Mainly because
he could've killed you.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.221
Do you remember
what happened next?

10:57.221 --> 10:59.049
When I didn't let go, that's
when he punched me in the face.

10:59.049 --> 11:02.009
And then I came out
and I rushed over to Grace,

11:02.009 --> 11:03.837
but then the other guy,
he grabbed me

11:03.837 --> 11:05.229
and he threw me to the ground
and just started stomping on me.

11:05.229 --> 11:08.624
And the other one just kept...

11:08.624 --> 11:10.017
he just kept kicking me.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.413
Would you be able to sit
with a sketch artist?

11:15.413 --> 11:18.460
I'll do anything I can
to get them off the street.

11:18.460 --> 11:20.288
Absolutely.
Same here.

11:20.288 --> 11:23.595
Good, and we'll do
everything we can to find them.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.121
She's a real badass.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.253
And lucky he didn't
have a knife or a gun.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.602
Well, I didn't say
she was smart,

11:30.602 --> 11:32.169
I said she's a badass.

11:32.169 --> 11:35.782
Hard to see their faces
with the baseball caps on.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.349
I have footage from the other
side of the street, too.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.179
Can you zoom in on the phone?

11:46.531 --> 11:48.098
Kind of blurry.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.621
Yeah.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.145
Hey, so you were right.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.842
The assault on your
two vics isn't part

11:52.842 --> 11:54.583
of the pattern of assaults
that we've been investigating.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.541
Hmm, what do you know?
Maybe you should

11:56.541 --> 11:58.456
leave the investigating
to us next time, huh?

11:58.456 --> 12:00.023
Okay, so you don't want me to
tell you about the cop

12:00.023 --> 12:01.372
who just collared
a guy in possession

12:01.372 --> 12:02.634
of one of Grace Mitchell's
credit cards?

12:02.634 --> 12:04.549
That's great.

12:04.549 --> 12:05.899
Tell your officer
to hold him there

12:05.899 --> 12:08.118
until we can get
over there and question him.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.859
Oh, you want a favor?
I thought I was supposed to

12:09.859 --> 12:11.774
leave the investigating to you.

12:18.563 --> 12:21.218
Hey, how's Sophia?

12:21.218 --> 12:22.480
She's upset, Anthony.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.004
I'll talk to her.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.440
Not right now.
She's talking to a therapist.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.747
A therapist?
What're you talking about?

12:27.747 --> 12:30.184
You know, just to help
with what she saw.

12:30.184 --> 12:33.013
Anthony, she hasn't
been able to eat.

12:33.013 --> 12:36.146
She's upset and agitated,
and when I told Erin...

12:36.146 --> 12:38.061
- You told Erin?
- Well, she came by

12:38.061 --> 12:40.760
to check on Sophia,
and when I told her,

12:40.760 --> 12:43.110
she suggested
Sophia talk to a therapist.

12:43.110 --> 12:44.633
And you didn't think to call me?

12:44.633 --> 12:45.939
I just figured you knew

12:45.939 --> 12:47.984
since it was coming
from your office.

12:57.385 --> 12:58.821
You went behind my back? Really?

12:58.821 --> 13:00.518
What're you talking about?

13:00.518 --> 13:02.390
You set Sophia up with
a counselor, and, what,

13:02.390 --> 13:04.348
you didn't think it was
important to let me know?

13:04.348 --> 13:06.568
Well, I thought Vivian
would've told you.

13:06.568 --> 13:07.830
Yeah, well, she didn't.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.527
Look, I'm just trying to help.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.877
Yeah, well, people
always say that

13:10.877 --> 13:12.487
right before they
screw things up.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.097
Look, Anthony, I don't think

13:14.097 --> 13:15.882
you're looking at this
the right way.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.622
I'll tell you
what I'm looking at:

13:17.622 --> 13:19.407
a prosecutor who'll do
anything to get an indictment.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.365
That's not fair,
and you know it.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.758
I'm her father, Erin.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.542
I'll decide what's best
for my daughter.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.631
You're just gonna
victimize her all over again.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.285
We have a suspect.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.244
Who is he?

13:30.244 --> 13:32.115
An ex-boyfriend of Miss Patty's.

13:32.115 --> 13:33.769
We have surveillance
video of him

13:33.769 --> 13:36.380
leaving the ballet studio
with blood on his shirt.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.556
Okay, so that's case closed.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.167
Not by a long shot.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.559
We both know it's gonna take

13:41.559 --> 13:43.126
more than that
to prove he's guilty.

13:43.126 --> 13:45.172
Sophia saw the murder.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.304
We need her to come in
and talk about what she saw,

13:47.304 --> 13:48.566
hopefully ID him.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.525
So this lunatic
can go after her?

13:50.525 --> 13:52.788
I will make sure
she's protected.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.311
Stop it, Erin.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.879
You can't guarantee that,
and you know it.

13:56.879 --> 13:59.099
Okay, I can guarantee that
if she doesn't come in

13:59.099 --> 14:01.318
and talk about what she saw,
he could go out

14:01.318 --> 14:03.451
and hurt someone else,
or even kill someone else.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.496
Or Sophia could get killed.

14:06.541 --> 14:09.152
Anthony, she is old enough
to come in here

14:09.152 --> 14:10.675
and answer some questions,

14:10.675 --> 14:12.416
and I think
that's what she needs to do.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.985
I don't want
to have to subpoena her.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.596
Do what you need to do.

14:25.473 --> 14:26.648
Hey.

14:26.648 --> 14:27.910
- Ready to go?
- Come here.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.303
Take a look at this.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.695
It's video footage
from the traffic cam

14:30.695 --> 14:32.741
where Sarah Longo was pushed.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.308
I thought this was kicked
upstairs to the squad.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.962
Detective Giorgio likes me.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.354
Yeah, you'll
solve his case for him,

14:37.354 --> 14:38.399
and he'll take all the credit.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.183
I don't care
about that.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.668
It was put through
facial recognition.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.061
So, now all we do
is cross our fingers.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.714
I really want to get
this guy off the street.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.891
Me, too.
Guy is pure evil.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.589
- I feel bad for her, too.
- I get that,

14:54.589 --> 14:56.069
but honestly,
she should be thankful

14:56.069 --> 14:57.548
that she doesn't
have worse injuries.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.594
Don't tell me you're
one of those people

14:59.594 --> 15:01.335
that make themselves
feel better about things

15:01.335 --> 15:03.554
by imagining an even
worse tragedy happening?

15:03.554 --> 15:05.556
Yes, I am.
I own that.

15:05.556 --> 15:08.733
We got a match
on facial recognition.

15:09.996 --> 15:13.825
Okay, meet Michael Harris.
Oh, serial offender.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.393
Assault, possession of a weapon,

15:16.393 --> 15:19.570
harassment, attempted murder.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.878
Wow, that's great.
Should we let the squad know?

15:22.878 --> 15:24.532
We should go pick him up,

15:24.532 --> 15:25.925
and then we'll
let the squad know.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.232
See? Sarah Longo
is lucky after all.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.496
We got your subpoena.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.107
Are you kidding me?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.500
Look, Anthony... Yeah, don't, okay?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.241
Some friend you are.

15:38.241 --> 15:41.331
Yeah, I am, and I'm hoping
you eventually realize that.

15:41.331 --> 15:43.159
You would have never
done this to Nicky.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.856
You would have never
put her though this.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.554
Yes, I would, and if I wasn't,

15:46.554 --> 15:47.816
I would hope
you would do something

15:47.816 --> 15:48.991
to make me see the light.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.732
Yeah, well, the difference is

15:50.732 --> 15:52.516
I wouldn't interfere with
how you parent your daughter.

15:52.516 --> 15:54.823
This has nothing to do
with parenting.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.651
What do you think
is going to happen

15:56.651 --> 15:58.609
if you don't encourage Sophia
to talk about what she saw?

15:58.609 --> 16:00.698
You think it's just
gonna magically disappear?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.178
I'm trying to keep her safe.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.963
So am I.By what,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.007
putting her in front
of a grand jury?

16:05.007 --> 16:06.400
Look, Anthony,

16:06.400 --> 16:08.358
I am going to prep her

16:08.358 --> 16:10.056
in this office
before she testifies

16:10.056 --> 16:12.754
to make sure that she knows
exactly what to expect.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.321
Just get her in here.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.149
You're interested
in one thing and one thing only.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.889
It's the right thing to do.

16:17.889 --> 16:20.544
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that, Erin.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.386
Do you think I'm a hard ass?

16:39.824 --> 16:41.609
I think it depends.

16:41.609 --> 16:44.481
Not the answer
I was looking for.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.963
Well, if the situation warrants,

16:47.963 --> 16:51.793
you can be...
rightfully demanding.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.099
How's that?

16:56.363 --> 16:58.582
What's on your mind?

16:58.582 --> 17:01.150
Anthony's 15-year-old
daughter Sophia

17:01.150 --> 17:03.805
was the only witness
to a murder.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.677
Okay.

17:06.677 --> 17:09.376
And he doesn't
want her cooperating.

17:09.376 --> 17:11.813
And he...

17:11.813 --> 17:14.294
thinks I only care
about the case.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.472
Well, Erin...

17:18.472 --> 17:19.951
At the end of the day,
you have to do

17:19.951 --> 17:22.606
what you think's right,

17:22.606 --> 17:25.218
even if it puts you
at odds with...

17:26.567 --> 17:29.222
...your most trusted confidante.

17:29.222 --> 17:32.094
Are we still
talking about me here?

17:32.094 --> 17:35.619
Well, let's just say being
a hard ass runs in the family.

17:38.100 --> 17:42.017
Anything to do with the off-duty
officer in the diner shooting?

17:42.017 --> 17:45.064
Yeah. According
to the guidelines,

17:45.064 --> 17:48.197
he did nothing wrong,
and Garrett thinks

17:48.197 --> 17:50.808
every cop
doesn't have to be a hero.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.638
And that I have
no right to demand that.

17:54.638 --> 17:58.425
Well, except you had a son
who made the ultimate sacrifice,

17:58.425 --> 18:00.731
so, yeah, I think that
qualifies you.

18:02.603 --> 18:05.693
See? Now, there's
the hard ass answer.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.701
You assaulted Grace Mitchell
and Adam Reynolds

18:13.701 --> 18:15.050
and you stole their belongings.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.921
Nah.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.793
You got it all wrong, dude.

18:18.793 --> 18:21.404
Okay, <i>dude,</i>
then tell me what happened.

18:21.404 --> 18:24.538
I found that card.
On the street.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.583
Right, you found it on
the street,

18:26.583 --> 18:28.019
and you just started using it.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.891
Yeah. Finders keepers.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.154
Finders keepers, huh?
Well, well.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.549
Oh, wow. Look what I found.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.377
A cell phone
belonging to Maurice.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.596
But I guess it actually
belongs to us now

18:39.596 --> 18:41.468
because, well, finders keepers.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.383
Hey, you can't see my phone.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.646
Why not?'Cause it's mine.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.170
Hmm. Well, you said yourself,
finders keepers.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.999
What don't we have CCS
hack into this for us, okay?

18:50.999 --> 18:52.783
Don't y'all need, like,
a warrant or something?

18:52.783 --> 18:55.569
Actually, we don't.
Unless we have your permission.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.701
Oh. Then you don't.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.790
- Hmm.
- You know this guy

18:59.790 --> 19:01.314
has two felony convictions?

19:01.314 --> 19:03.098
That's really bad news
for him, isn't it?

19:03.098 --> 19:05.448
Hey, I did my time.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.928
- Right.
- Oh, but did you know

19:06.928 --> 19:09.278
that having two prior
felony convictions

19:09.278 --> 19:11.933
means that this time,
this felony conviction

19:11.933 --> 19:14.892
will get you mandatory
16 years to life.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.938
- Mm-hmm.
- What're you talking about?

19:16.938 --> 19:18.418
What she's talking about
is you're a three-time loser,

19:18.418 --> 19:20.202
so the only thing
standing between you

19:20.202 --> 19:23.205
and 16 years is us.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.815
And once we pick up
your accomplice,

19:24.815 --> 19:27.775
and he decides to cooperate,
then he'll get the deal,

19:27.775 --> 19:30.081
and you'll... Go up the proverbial creek.

19:30.081 --> 19:32.171
You know which one
that is right?

19:33.433 --> 19:35.086
You made your point.

19:35.086 --> 19:36.218
- You want to unlock the phone?
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.654
I'll unlock it.

19:37.654 --> 19:40.483
Carefully. Make sure
you don't erase anything.

19:46.054 --> 19:47.577
What time was the assault?

19:47.577 --> 19:50.058
Um, 9:30.

19:51.538 --> 19:54.845
What do you know?
"She's on the way out now."

19:54.845 --> 19:57.848
Sent at 9:29.
That from your partner?

19:59.110 --> 20:01.243
Nah, it's from the dude
who paid us to do it.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.244
What dude?

20:02.244 --> 20:06.248
The chick's boyfriend. Adam.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.872
Hi, Sophia, how you doing?

20:21.872 --> 20:24.179
- A little nervous.
- Okay.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.789
Well, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

20:25.789 --> 20:27.878
I'm going to be here,
and I won't ask you

20:27.878 --> 20:29.358
to do anything that
makes you uncomfortable.

20:29.358 --> 20:31.142
And you don't have
to answer anything

20:31.142 --> 20:32.796
that makes you
uncomfortable, either.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.842
Okay, do you
want to have a seat?

20:34.842 --> 20:36.670
Emily's gonna
help us out today.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.238
Can I see you outside?

20:40.891 --> 20:43.067
So, you can't be here, okay?

20:43.067 --> 20:44.547
- Why not?
- Because you're not

20:44.547 --> 20:47.115
a D.A. investigator
on this, you're a dad.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.030
And you think I'm just going to
leave her alone in there?

20:49.030 --> 20:50.901
She's not alone,
she's with me,

20:50.901 --> 20:53.208
and she's with a paralegal.
She'll be fine.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.776
I don't know about this, Erin.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.431
Anthony, I need to get her ready
for the grand jury.

20:58.431 --> 21:00.868
Okay? She will be
safe and protected,

21:00.868 --> 21:03.740
and I will send someone
to get you when we're done.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.835
Okay, let's get started.

21:14.621 --> 21:15.970
You recognize him?

21:17.493 --> 21:19.147
- No.
- That's funny,

21:19.147 --> 21:20.757
because he told us
that you hired him

21:20.757 --> 21:22.585
and his brother
to rob your girlfriend.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.108
And we've already
got a subpoena

21:24.108 --> 21:25.893
for your text messages.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.677
You don't have anything.

21:27.677 --> 21:31.290
Hmm, okay. Well, then maybe
we should bring Grace in here

21:31.290 --> 21:33.814
and she could tell us
what happened herself.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.557
My God, why would you
bring her here?

21:37.557 --> 21:39.776
I thought you didn't have
anything to hide.

21:39.776 --> 21:42.953
We'll just bring her in
and show her Maurice's picture.

21:42.953 --> 21:44.346
Of course, then
we'll have to show her

21:44.346 --> 21:46.609
the text messages
between you and Maurice.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.568
You know, the ones
where you warned him

21:48.568 --> 21:50.221
that she was coming
out of the restaurant

21:50.221 --> 21:52.485
just in time for him
to rob her and assault her.

21:52.485 --> 21:55.314
No, I'd never do anything

21:55.314 --> 21:57.054
to hurt Grace, okay?
Just the opposite.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.448
Like hire two guys
to rob her and beat her up?

21:59.448 --> 22:01.581
They weren't supposed to
really attack.

22:01.581 --> 22:04.323
They were supposed to
pretend to rob her.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.933
Why?

22:05.933 --> 22:07.369
So I could come out
and stop the robbery,

22:07.369 --> 22:08.631
and those guys
were supposed to run away,

22:08.631 --> 22:09.980
pretending to be scared of me.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.287
Sacred of you? To what end?

22:12.287 --> 22:14.768
I wanted to be a hero, you know?

22:14.768 --> 22:16.422
She'd think I saved her,

22:16.422 --> 22:18.119
and then she wouldn't
want to break up with me.

22:18.119 --> 22:20.861
You did this
because you thought

22:20.861 --> 22:22.689
she was going to
break up with you?

22:22.689 --> 22:24.734
One of her friends told me
she was getting bored.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.607
So, to spice things up,
you hire a couple of criminals

22:27.607 --> 22:29.652
to scare the crap out of her
and beat her up?

22:29.652 --> 22:30.697
I told you,
they were never supposed to

22:30.697 --> 22:33.439
lay their hands on her. I swear.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.049
But then the guy,
he tried to steal her bag,

22:35.049 --> 22:37.921
and she fought back,
she wouldn't give it up,

22:37.921 --> 22:40.054
and then that's when they
started hitting her for real.

22:40.054 --> 22:43.057
So now it's her fault
that she got beat up? Not yours.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.581
No, it just...

22:45.581 --> 22:47.235
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

22:47.235 --> 22:48.584
That wasn't the plan.

22:48.584 --> 22:49.846
I tried to intervene,

22:49.846 --> 22:51.805
I tried to get her to let it go,

22:51.805 --> 22:53.676
but then they started...

22:53.676 --> 22:56.287
punching and kicking me, too.

22:58.246 --> 23:00.553
Some hero you are.

23:05.253 --> 23:06.776
Thanks for coming up.

23:06.776 --> 23:09.083
If this is a disciplinary
meeting of some sort,

23:09.083 --> 23:12.086
I'm not comfortable answering
questions without my union rep.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.001
Nah, you don't need
your union rep.

23:14.001 --> 23:17.091
Internal Affairs cleared
you of any wrongdoing.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.571
That's great news.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.834
Congratulations.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.923
He in? I need a word with him.

23:22.923 --> 23:25.099
Not right now.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.234
- That's Officer Hayes.
- It is.

23:30.234 --> 23:32.106
I didn't get a memo
about the meeting.

23:32.106 --> 23:34.456
The boss didn't think
it was necessary.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.853
So they said you did
what you were required to do.

23:39.853 --> 23:43.334
You called 911, and that is
considered taking action.

23:43.334 --> 23:45.206
And I gave a great
description of the perp.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.426
Absolutely right.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.037
From your hiding place
under the counter.

23:50.037 --> 23:51.604
Excuse me?

23:51.604 --> 23:54.476
Somehow you managed to do

23:54.476 --> 23:58.349
the minimum
you were required to do.

23:58.349 --> 24:01.091
There's nothing that says I have
to put my life on the line.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.354
If I'd have fire,
I could've been killed.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.531
You're not exactly a guy

24:05.531 --> 24:08.664
I'd want to be
in a foxhole with.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.884
We're not in a foxhole,
we're in a city,

24:10.884 --> 24:14.453
one that likes to crucify cops
for any and every infraction.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.498
If I'd have used my weapon
and shot an innocent,

24:16.498 --> 24:19.240
I'd be on the cover of
the <i>Post,</i> labeled a murderer.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.720
Instead of a coward?

24:20.720 --> 24:23.113
I did what I had to.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.551
You have no recourse.

24:25.551 --> 24:28.945
You're absolutely
right about that.

24:30.947 --> 24:32.296
You're dismissed.

24:36.997 --> 24:39.086
Oh, by the way...

24:40.870 --> 24:45.309
Monday, you are to
report to your new position

24:45.309 --> 24:47.834
at Fleet Services.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.533
Fleet Services?
That's in Queens.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.230
I live in Staten Island.

24:54.188 --> 24:56.538
Is that a problem, Officer?

24:56.538 --> 24:59.585
That's a rubber gun squad.
You can't do that.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.414
Actually, according to

25:03.414 --> 25:06.026
the Patrol Guide
you so revere...

25:07.244 --> 25:08.550
I can.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.901
Enjoy your new post.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.960
So, we arrested him
and now he's at Central Booking,

25:26.960 --> 25:28.527
and he's awaiting arraignment.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.050
And the judge will
probably let him off

25:30.050 --> 25:31.834
with no bail,
like everyone else these days.

25:31.834 --> 25:34.533
He has a record, so that
will be taken into account.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.187
Hey.

25:38.362 --> 25:39.755
Which one's your favorite?

25:40.756 --> 25:42.541
None.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.194
I didn't go to any.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.327
You haven't left your
hotel room since the attack?

25:46.327 --> 25:48.982
No.

25:48.982 --> 25:51.114
Not that it's
any of your business.

25:53.116 --> 25:54.901
Okay.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.424
Can I be left alone now?

25:56.424 --> 25:59.209
Come on. Let's go.

26:05.085 --> 26:07.522
She literally hasn't left her
room since this happened.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.829
I know.
It is not our problem.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.700
We're not ambassadors
to every tourist

26:11.700 --> 26:13.049
who gets taken
for a ride

26:13.049 --> 26:14.790
and then wants to blame
the entire city.

26:14.790 --> 26:17.053
Most of the time, all we see
is the underside of the city,

26:17.053 --> 26:18.968
and we never
let it get to us.

26:18.968 --> 26:21.405
Exactly.
Congratulations to us.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.059
Now, let's get back to work.

26:23.059 --> 26:25.540
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

26:36.377 --> 26:38.379
- There you go.
- Grace,

26:38.379 --> 26:40.424
the D.A. said she can
talk to you later today.

26:40.424 --> 26:42.426
Do you want me to organize
a ride home for you?

26:42.426 --> 26:44.733
No, um...
No, no, it's okay. I can...

26:44.733 --> 26:46.779
I can walk from here. Thanks.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.044
You son of a bitch!

26:51.044 --> 26:53.263
You are nothing but a coward!

26:53.263 --> 26:54.700
I'm sorry.

26:54.700 --> 26:55.918
I hope you rot in prison.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.137
Get him out of here.

26:58.965 --> 27:02.751
Thank you
for all your help.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.448
Of course.

27:04.448 --> 27:05.972
And thank you.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.499
Congrats on closing your case.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.240
You're welcome.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.113
You know, he did help us
close this case.

27:17.113 --> 27:19.768
I'm aware of that.
Thank you.

27:19.768 --> 27:21.770
Then why do you always
have to make it so awkward?

27:21.770 --> 27:23.598
Why can't you
just say, "Thank you?"

27:23.598 --> 27:26.122
I will next time,
okay, Mom?

27:26.122 --> 27:28.081
I'm just saying,

27:28.081 --> 27:30.083
he tried to make
an effort with you.

27:30.083 --> 27:33.086
It's nothing to do with any
past disagreements we've had.

27:33.086 --> 27:35.697
I think you're a little
too old for a sibling rivalry.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.003
It's not that either.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.265
Well, what is it then?

27:39.832 --> 27:41.572
You do realize when he was shot,

27:41.572 --> 27:43.400
it was working
one of our cases, right?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.707
Yeah, but that was
just a coincidence.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.796
No, to you it was.

27:47.796 --> 27:50.538
To me, it was
my worst nightmare.

27:50.538 --> 27:52.627
What, the fear of losing
another brother?

27:53.715 --> 27:55.717
Yeah.

27:57.588 --> 28:00.896
It's more than that. You know...

28:00.896 --> 28:03.594
I've seen my dad afraid once.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.815
In my entire life, one time.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.165
That was the night
my brother Joe was killed.

28:11.124 --> 28:15.171
34 years,
I never saw him afraid.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.826
And he's never
been the same since.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.915
It's understandable.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.831
No, I know that, but I also
made a promise that night

28:22.831 --> 28:26.356
that I would do everything
and anything in my power

28:26.356 --> 28:29.229
to make sure he never
had to experience that again.

28:29.229 --> 28:34.190
Jamie being a cop
and working with us, it just...

28:34.190 --> 28:37.803
makes it a little difficult
to keep that promise.

28:37.803 --> 28:40.762
Because you think
it's your job to keep him safe?

28:41.850 --> 28:43.939
I don't know. I...

28:43.939 --> 28:47.029
I know I can't do that.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.857
It's just,
when he works with us,

28:48.857 --> 28:50.772
I just wish he would
stay on the sidelines

28:50.772 --> 28:53.427
and stay out of harm's way.
That way...

28:55.168 --> 28:59.041
That way, I can keep from
disappointing my old man again.

29:00.173 --> 29:03.785
Losing another brother
on my watch...

29:03.785 --> 29:06.396
But Jamie doesn't know that,

29:06.396 --> 29:09.182
and to him, you just come across

29:09.182 --> 29:12.315
as an ass most of the time.
You really want that?

29:16.058 --> 29:18.147
No.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.377
Hey.

29:31.421 --> 29:32.683
Hi.

29:34.294 --> 29:37.036
You want a drink
or something to eat?

29:37.036 --> 29:39.908
No, I just
popped by to tell you

29:39.908 --> 29:42.781
that Sophia is definitely
her father's daughter.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.218
She gave great details
on the murder,

29:45.218 --> 29:48.438
and picked the suspect out
from a double-blind photo array.

29:48.438 --> 29:49.918
The ex-boyfriend?

29:49.918 --> 29:52.138
Yeah, being arrested
as we speak.

29:52.138 --> 29:54.183
That's good.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.839
But, you know, um...

29:59.406 --> 30:02.409
...the most disappointing part
of all this

30:02.409 --> 30:03.802
is you didn't think

30:03.802 --> 30:05.499
I had Sophia's
best interests at heart.

30:05.499 --> 30:08.197
Erin, look... No, you listen to me.

30:08.197 --> 30:12.636
You're like family to me,
and so is Sophia.

30:12.636 --> 30:15.117
The fact that you
didn't trust me,

30:15.117 --> 30:17.859
or even questioned
my motives,

30:17.859 --> 30:20.035
well, that just...

30:22.211 --> 30:23.778
...it hurt.

30:27.173 --> 30:29.001
It hurt.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.145
You ever add up how much money

30:43.145 --> 30:44.668
you've put into this car
over the years?

30:44.668 --> 30:46.409
You can't put a price
on nostalgia.

30:46.409 --> 30:48.629
So true.

30:48.629 --> 30:50.674
I had my first kiss in that car.

30:50.674 --> 30:52.676
Kenny LeBrandy.

30:52.676 --> 30:55.462
Joe taught me how to
drive in this car. Hmm.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.638
That would explain why
you still can't make a U-turn.

30:57.638 --> 31:00.119
You know, I went to my
senior prom in this car.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.424
With Marie Romano.

31:01.424 --> 31:04.166
Ah, also known as
"Double D" Marie.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.387
Mm-hmm. Yeah, well,

31:07.387 --> 31:09.650
I can tell you
from experience, she wasn't.

31:15.264 --> 31:19.355
Congratulations on, uh, closing
the case against Adam Reynolds.

31:19.355 --> 31:21.227
We charged him with conspiracy.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.359
Wow. He gonna see any time?

31:23.359 --> 31:25.622
First offense, three to five.

31:25.622 --> 31:28.843
Good. Well, I couldn't have
closed it without Jamie.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.236
That's not true.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.368
It is true.

31:35.937 --> 31:37.678
Why are you being
so nice, anyway?

31:37.678 --> 31:38.897
Hmm, he's probably
looking for someone

31:38.897 --> 31:40.942
to take over his dish duty.

31:40.942 --> 31:43.945
No, I'm not. I just...

31:43.945 --> 31:47.122
realize that I can be
a pain in the ass sometimes.

31:48.645 --> 31:50.473
Sorry.
Sometimes, or all the time?

31:50.473 --> 31:52.475
I'm not talking to you.

31:52.475 --> 31:53.607
Ah.

31:53.607 --> 31:54.913
And arrogant.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.915
Arrogant, yes. Arrogant.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.047
And often ungrateful.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.571
That's why nobody ever
wants to apologize to a Reagan.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.008
They make it impossible.

32:04.139 --> 32:05.967
Wait, was this you apologizing?

32:05.967 --> 32:07.273
Uh, did you hear an apology?

32:07.273 --> 32:08.491
- I didn't hear one.
- Definitely not.

32:08.491 --> 32:09.840
It was.

32:11.059 --> 32:13.322
And it is an apology.

32:17.892 --> 32:20.025
That looked like it hurt.
Are you okay?

32:20.025 --> 32:21.026
- It still hurts.
- Yeah.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.592
I'm gonna go inside.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.334
That... That was awkward.

32:26.509 --> 32:27.554
You okay?

32:27.554 --> 32:30.949
I'm okay. Sorry.

32:33.212 --> 32:36.737
You really transferred
the guy to Fleet Services?

32:36.737 --> 32:39.522
He'll have a lot
to think about on his commute.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.828
That he will.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.656
You're pretty ruthless.
Just saying.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.440
So I've been told.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.225
Some might say a "hard ass."

32:46.225 --> 32:47.835
I think you did
the right thing.

32:47.835 --> 32:50.098
- I agree.
- A cop's still a cop,

32:50.098 --> 32:52.622
it shouldn't matter what
- suit of clothes he's wearing.
- Well said.

32:52.622 --> 32:54.276
I get you're
looking at this through

32:54.276 --> 32:55.974
your own ethical lens,

32:55.974 --> 32:58.237
but won't there be blowback
if you discipline him

32:58.237 --> 32:59.890
when he didn't break any rules?

32:59.890 --> 33:02.328
I didn't discipline him,
I just transferred him.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.634
A distinction
without a difference.

33:04.634 --> 33:06.897
Hey, some guys
aren't cut out for patrol.

33:06.897 --> 33:09.204
But, he wasn't on patrol.
He was off duty.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.250
A distinction
without a difference.

33:11.250 --> 33:14.035
I mean, you can train
and you can prepare,

33:14.035 --> 33:15.558
but you never know until
you're in that moment

33:15.558 --> 33:17.343
if you have what it
takes or not.

33:17.343 --> 33:19.040
I'm with Dad on this.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.086
There's no room in
the department for anybody

33:21.086 --> 33:22.652
who's not willing
to step up and act

33:22.652 --> 33:24.045
when someone's life
is on the line.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.612
"Courage is not
the absence of fear,

33:25.612 --> 33:26.656
but the triumph over it."

33:26.656 --> 33:28.528
"And the brave man is not he

33:28.528 --> 33:30.791
"who does not feel afraid,

33:30.791 --> 33:32.575
but he who conquers that fear."

33:33.968 --> 33:35.143
Martin Luther King?

33:35.143 --> 33:36.536
Nelson Mandela.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.843
I still think
it's harsh punishment

33:39.843 --> 33:42.020
for inaction
when you're off duty.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.326
Well, you haven't seen
harsh punishment from him

33:44.326 --> 33:46.024
until you tried telling him
you don't want to get up early

33:46.024 --> 33:47.329
for Mass on a Sunday morning.

33:47.329 --> 33:49.201
Hey, I was trying
to build character.

33:49.201 --> 33:50.898
Uh-huh.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.031
Looking around
the table, Francis,

33:53.031 --> 33:55.163
I think it worked.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.384
Amen to that.

33:59.733 --> 34:02.040
Bless us, O Lord,
and these thy gifts,

34:02.040 --> 34:04.477
which we are about to receive,
from thy bounty...

34:05.956 --> 34:09.090
You did a great job.
I'm so proud of you.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.397
Thanks. It wasn't as scary
- as I thought it would be.
- Yeah.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.790
Hi.
Hi.

34:13.790 --> 34:16.445
Sophia, this is Jennifer,
Miss Patty's daughter.

34:16.445 --> 34:17.751
Oh.

34:17.751 --> 34:19.361
I just want to thank you so much

34:19.361 --> 34:21.189
for coming forward like you did.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.322
It was really brave.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.715
I'm really sorry about your mom.

34:29.371 --> 34:30.720
Thank you.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.688
Hey, who was that?

34:41.688 --> 34:42.950
Miss Patty's daughter.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.299
Sophia did a great job

34:44.299 --> 34:46.127
testifying in front
of the grand jury.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.347
You're free to
take her home.

34:48.347 --> 34:49.913
Thank you, Ms. Reagan.

34:49.913 --> 34:52.307
- Erin, please.
- Erin.

34:52.307 --> 34:54.222
I know this wasn't easy,
but you can go home

34:54.222 --> 34:56.920
knowing you're helping to put
a really bad man away.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.358
Oh.

35:02.274 --> 35:03.884
Come on, honey.

35:30.650 --> 35:32.217
I got you one.

35:32.217 --> 35:35.481
Officer Hayes is filing
a grievance with the union.

35:35.481 --> 35:37.961
Let him. He doesn't
have a leg to stand on.

35:37.961 --> 35:41.008
Optics aren't great.
It'll look like punishment.

35:42.183 --> 35:44.446
Which is exactly what you want.

35:45.534 --> 35:47.667
I may not have walked a beat,

35:47.667 --> 35:50.713
but I understand more
than you think.

35:50.713 --> 35:54.282
And what is it you think
you understand, Garrett?

35:54.282 --> 35:57.155
Why this case gets to you.

35:57.155 --> 36:00.462
I understand that if you'd been
the guy sitting in that diner,

36:00.462 --> 36:02.160
you would have gotten involved.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.337
I sense a parable.

36:05.337 --> 36:08.078
And that diner owner
and those two victims

36:08.078 --> 36:11.952
would likely be having dinner
with their own families tonight.

36:11.952 --> 36:15.521
And maybe your family
would be at your funeral.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.133
Because that's how you roll.

36:19.133 --> 36:22.223
It occurred to me that
you expect Officer Hayes

36:22.223 --> 36:23.616
to intervene.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.444
You expected him to

36:25.444 --> 36:28.011
put his life on the line
without question.

36:28.011 --> 36:29.491
There's no part of you

36:29.491 --> 36:31.885
that doesn't understand
why he didn't.

36:31.885 --> 36:34.148
You think that's what cops do.

36:34.148 --> 36:35.410
But you don't?

36:35.410 --> 36:36.846
I get the theoretical,

36:36.846 --> 36:38.674
but honestly, Frank,

36:38.674 --> 36:41.460
do you really
expect someone off duty

36:41.460 --> 36:43.288
to possibly
get themselves killed

36:43.288 --> 36:47.117
as some sort of self-sacrifice
to save innocents?

36:47.117 --> 36:49.468
Yeah, I do.

36:49.468 --> 36:52.558
There is the letter,
and a spirit,

36:52.558 --> 36:54.516
in the oath we take.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.605
A good cop has to honor both.

36:56.605 --> 36:59.869
All these years in, you still
idealize the profession.

36:59.869 --> 37:03.699
Oh, I turned in
my rose-colored lenses

37:03.699 --> 37:05.440
for readers a long time ago.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.442
You're unique in how
you look at the world,

37:07.442 --> 37:08.878
I'll give you that.

37:08.878 --> 37:11.229
Is that your way
of saying I'm a dinosaur?

37:11.229 --> 37:14.232
Sort of like the way
you didn't invite me

37:14.232 --> 37:16.538
to your meeting with Hayes
as your way of saying

37:16.538 --> 37:19.193
things are going to be done
your way, protocol be damned.

37:19.193 --> 37:20.847
I didn't invite you
to the meeting

37:20.847 --> 37:22.327
because it was
a personnel matter.

37:22.327 --> 37:23.893
Like hell. You didn't invite me

37:23.893 --> 37:26.113
because I didn't agree with you.

37:26.113 --> 37:30.248
I have never demanded
consensus from you, Garrett.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.946
No, but when a case
gets under your skin,

37:32.946 --> 37:35.601
you don't want to hear
anything but your side.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.995
But what do I know?
I'm not a cop.

37:40.736 --> 37:43.739
For what it's worth, I think
you'd make a great cop.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.393
Thank you.

37:45.393 --> 37:47.700
But no,
not by your standards.

37:47.700 --> 37:51.399
I'd be the guy under the table
dialing 911, too.

37:52.922 --> 37:55.098
Maybe not, given the day.

37:55.098 --> 37:59.277
Oh, absolutely. Any day.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.888
We're both better off
with me where I am,

38:01.888 --> 38:04.543
the thorn in your side.

38:07.981 --> 38:10.331
Not always.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.291
But just enough.

38:24.563 --> 38:25.607
Hi.

38:25.607 --> 38:27.522
I do trust you.

38:27.522 --> 38:30.003
It hasn't felt that way lately.

38:30.003 --> 38:32.397
Look, I just wanted more
than anything to protect her

38:32.397 --> 38:35.704
from all the horrible
stuff in the world,

38:35.704 --> 38:37.576
and I felt like a failure
because I couldn't.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.621
But you can't
protect her from this.

38:39.621 --> 38:42.015
It's random,
heat of the moment.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.669
You're right.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.366
And that's the logical way
to look at it,

38:45.366 --> 38:47.455
but I wasn't thinking logically.

38:47.455 --> 38:49.370
Look, it's hard
for you to understand,

38:49.370 --> 38:51.677
with your family and all,
but when I was growing up,

38:51.677 --> 38:53.505
we didn't talk about things.

38:54.723 --> 38:57.204
It was more like,
ignore it and it'll go away.

38:57.204 --> 39:00.816
Even "I love you"
sounded more like,

39:00.816 --> 39:03.297
"Have you checked
the oil lately?"

39:04.254 --> 39:06.169
I get it, I do,

39:06.169 --> 39:09.434
but it doesn't mean you need to
carry on the tradition.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.914
I'm learning.

39:11.914 --> 39:14.090
How's she doing?

39:14.090 --> 39:17.833
Honestly, she's happier
since she testified.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.487
I mean, still traumatized,

39:19.487 --> 39:21.184
don't get me wrong,
but I can tell

39:21.184 --> 39:23.012
she's proud of herself.

39:23.012 --> 39:25.406
Feels like she made
a difference, you know?

39:25.406 --> 39:27.016
She did make a difference.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.583
When the defense read her
grand jury testimony,

39:28.583 --> 39:31.369
they agreed to discuss a plea.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.718
- Wow. That's great.
- Yeah,

39:32.718 --> 39:34.676
Sophia won't have to go
through a trial.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.461
Ah, that's such a relief, Erin.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.899
I hope you can forgive me.

39:39.899 --> 39:42.902
Well, that depends.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.338
On what?

39:44.338 --> 39:46.645
Dinner. I haven't eaten.

39:46.645 --> 39:49.909
Well, how about if I take you
to the best Italian meal

39:49.909 --> 39:52.215
you ever had at Da Nico's
on Mulberry Street?

39:52.215 --> 39:54.957
Well, that sounds like a
throw-down if I ever heard one.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.046
My car's around the corner.
I'll drive.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.700
One question though:

39:58.700 --> 40:00.441
have you checked the oil lately?

40:04.489 --> 40:06.229
I don't understand.
What're we doing here?

40:06.229 --> 40:08.101
There's someone
we'd like you to meet.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.842
Oh, no, I don't want
- to meet anyone.
- Oh, no, no, no.

40:09.842 --> 40:10.886
You're gonna
want to meet her,

40:10.886 --> 40:12.322
she's a real New Yorker.

40:12.322 --> 40:13.759
She's seen worse than
you happen in New York.

40:13.759 --> 40:16.065
And she still loves
the city with a passion.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.980
The Statue of Liberty?

40:17.980 --> 40:19.460
- You got it.
- Really?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.506
Our shields don't get us
too much these days,

40:21.506 --> 40:23.551
but it can still get us
into certain landmarks

40:23.551 --> 40:25.292
without having to wait.

40:25.292 --> 40:28.164
I don't know what to say. Really...

40:30.036 --> 40:32.212
I've never
been on a boat before.

40:32.212 --> 40:34.562
- What?
- Wait till
I tell my parents.

40:36.172 --> 40:39.132
Wait. Should I get
a New York hot dog before we go?

40:39.132 --> 40:41.134
- Uh, yeah.
- You got to get a
New York hot dog,

40:41.134 --> 40:42.614
- I suppose.
- Okay.

40:42.614 --> 40:45.094
- Yeah?
- Hi.

40:45.094 --> 40:49.577
What happened to Mr. "We are not
ambassadors to every tourist"?

40:49.577 --> 40:52.580
Yeah, I couldn't get my dad's
voice out of my head.

40:52.580 --> 40:53.973
How so?

40:53.973 --> 40:55.757
He was from
the Dominican Republic.

40:55.757 --> 40:58.107
Came to New York in 1967.

40:58.107 --> 41:00.806
Loved the city
the minute he arrived.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.503
So, every time
a new relative came by,

41:02.503 --> 41:05.245
he would drag us to every
tourist attraction in Manhattan

41:05.245 --> 41:06.464
because he wanted to make sure

41:06.464 --> 41:07.943
everyone else
loved it, too.

41:14.602 --> 41:15.908
Oh, my God.

41:15.908 --> 41:17.953
It's so beautiful.

41:17.953 --> 41:21.304
How about you let that be
your memory of New York City?

41:21.304 --> 41:24.220
I will. And thank you.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.222
Thank you both.

41:26.222 --> 41:27.572
Hey, can I get
a picture with you guys?

41:27.572 --> 41:29.356
- Uh, yeah.
- Of course you can.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.664
I am a model, so of course.

41:34.317 --> 41:35.493
Say, "Cheese."

41:35.493 --> 41:37.625
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.235
- There you go.
- Thank you.

41:40.802 --> 41:44.502
This is a really good thing
you did today, Badillo.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.199
Can't wait to tell
the rest of the squad.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.244
Oh, no. No way. You can't.

41:48.244 --> 41:50.725
What?
I have a
reputation to uphold.

41:50.725 --> 41:53.641
Okay, tough guy,

41:53.641 --> 41:55.338
your secret's safe with me.

41:55.338 --> 41:57.427
Thank you.

41:57.427 --> 42:01.083
I bet your dad would be
so impressed with you today.
