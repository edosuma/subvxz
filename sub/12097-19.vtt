03:56.302 --> 03:59.305
we all thought you were dead...

And, well, I mean, you know,
when you think a person is dead,

then you start doing things
as if they are not there,

they are not.

with another man.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.378
The only thing
that could be so awful

05:13.379 --> 05:14.880
is if you gave away
all my clothes,

05:14.881 --> 05:16.381
or you took up with another man.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.883

you were dead, Chester,

it's not true,

11:09.235 --> 11:10.235
What?

11:10.236 --> 11:12.737
Behind glass.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.239
My Dutch, behind glass.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.241
Dirty screws!

11:16.242 --> 11:19.244
Eunice, please, relax, honey.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.245
Relax?

Boy, you look good, sweetie.

11:26.252 --> 11:29.254
Oh, Dutch,
I can't bear being without you.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.756
I'm going nuts in here
without you too.

11:31.757 --> 11:35.761
Dutch, you have no idea
what it's like out here.

11:42.768 --> 11:46.271
Yes, I do, Eunice.
I was out there.

what it's like in here.

There's no privacy.
There's no quiet.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.277

You can't take a shower
by yourself.

he'll find her here.

coming up the driveway?

You've got to listen to him.

he's telling the truth.

No, no, they told me
to go to the store

15:26.492 --> 15:27.992
to get some traps and cheese,

15:27.993 --> 15:28.993

you slept with Sally,

16:45.571 --> 16:47.573
and now you tell me
that you slept with no one.

16:49.074 --> 16:53.578
Burt, one of the tricks
to lying successfully

16:53.579 --> 16:56.080
is to not keep changing
your story.

16:56.081 --> 16:59.083
But, Mare, I'm not lying.
I swear, I told you the truth.

17:01.086 --> 17:04.088
Well, both times, actually.

When I told you
I slept with Sally,

17:06.090 --> 17:08.092
that was the truth,
because then, I thought I did,

17:08.093 --> 17:10.094
but now, when I tell you
I didn't sleep with Sally,

17:10.095 --> 17:13.598
it's the truth,
because I found out I never did.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.388
and tell him he's a father.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.891
You see, that way, he'll know.

22:06.892 --> 22:07.892
Otherwise, I mean, he won't,

22:07.893 --> 22:09.393
and why should he come
and see his son

22:09.394 --> 22:10.895
if he doesn't know
that he has one?

22:10.896 --> 22:13.898
That's a good idea, Ma,

22:13.899 --> 22:15.399
but... but Tim
doesn't believe

22:15.400 --> 22:16.901
it's his baby.

22:16.902 --> 22:19.403
Well, considering
how good-looking that baby is,

22:19.404 --> 22:21.406
I don't believe it either.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.916
Ma...

22:31.917 --> 22:33.417
why don't we all go downstairs

22:33.418 --> 22:35.419
and let him sleep.

22:35.420 --> 22:36.921
He's had a very busy day.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.923
I'll say he had a busy day.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.425
I've changed him six times.
