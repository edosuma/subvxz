they are not.

The only thing
that could be so awful

05:13.379 --> 05:14.880
is if you gave away
all my clothes,

05:14.881 --> 05:16.381
or you took up with another man.

you were dead, Chester,

and tell him he's a father.

22:04.389 --> 22:06.891
You see, that way, he'll know.

22:06.892 --> 22:07.892
Otherwise, I mean, he won't,

22:07.893 --> 22:09.393
and why should he come
and see his son

22:09.394 --> 22:10.895
if he doesn't know
that he has one?

22:10.896 --> 22:13.898
That's a good idea, Ma,

22:13.899 --> 22:15.399
but... but Tim
doesn't believe

22:15.400 --> 22:16.901
it's his baby.

22:16.902 --> 22:19.403
Well, considering
how good-looking that baby is,

22:19.404 --> 22:21.406
I don't believe it either.

Ma...

22:31.917 --> 22:33.417
why don't we all go downstairs

22:33.418 --> 22:35.419
and let him sleep.

22:35.420 --> 22:36.921
He's had a very busy day.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.923
I'll say he had a busy day.

22:38.924 --> 22:40.425
I've changed him six times.
