00:08.640 --> 00:11.670
"the men and women of new york "are a special breed,"

00:11.730 --> 00:14.270
capable of surviving the urban jungle.

00:14.340 --> 00:15.990
"But at what price?

00:16.059 --> 00:19.530
"We've grown accustomed to living with the violence,"squalor,

00:19.620 --> 00:27.260
and most of all,"the acts of depravity both large and small that robs us all of our humanity.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.300
" "Depravity both large and small"?

00:29.380 --> 00:31.880
That joey conway turns one hell of a phrase.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.230
Turned.

00:33.340 --> 00:35.380
This is why I walk to work.

00:35.460 --> 00:38.930
I hate to break it to all of you,but this is a crime scene.

00:39.010 --> 00:40.630
Can we try not to cross-contaminate it?

00:40.700 --> 00:41.830
Sorry.

00:46.850 --> 00:50.230
Or we can ignore all rules and protocol and do whatever the hell we want.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.630
Well,somebody definitely wanted this guy dead.

00:52.690 --> 00:58.600
'Cause there's multiple stab wounds,most of 'em around the heart.

01:02.940 --> 01:07.420
beaten,stabbed to death,through the heart.

01:07.510 --> 01:09.980
Help me,sam.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.470
make sure you get that,chris.

01:15.250 --> 01:22.510
joey was one of those nabobs liked to wear a scarf like it was the kentucky derby.

01:22.610 --> 01:24.080
So many stab wounds.

01:24.170 --> 01:27.420
Not a lot of junkies would put in that kind off effort.

01:27.500 --> 01:31.130
So then the question is,who'd want the city's most beloved columnist dead?

01:31.220 --> 01:33.960
That ain't the question.The question is who'd want him alive?

01:34.040 --> 01:42.540
Any similarity between joey conway and a human being would be purely coincidental.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.840
No,it don't come easy the loot's not a big fan of the press.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.500
Any ideas who murdered joey conway?

01:47.570 --> 01:49.460
How could a man be stabbed to death on the subway?

01:49.560 --> 01:51.083
Lieutenant hunt,given your history with conway,

01:51.083 --> 01:53.551
are you really going to investigate this case?

01:53.630 --> 01:57.080
As soon as we have something,you'll be the first to know.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.340
You can even play them easy what was she talking about,boss?

02:01.420 --> 02:03.280
Your history with joey conway?

02:03.340 --> 02:04.750
Harry.

02:05.090 --> 02:06.690
Hey,gene.

02:06.800 --> 02:07.680
You son of a gun.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.440
How you been?

02:08.530 --> 02:09.620
Okay.How are you?

02:09.740 --> 02:10.650
Excuse me.

02:10.780 --> 02:14.030
I rue the day "kojak" hit the airwaves.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.420
as i assume most of you realize by now due to the fact that a swarm of locusts is now in your precinct,

02:21.420 --> 02:23.170
that this is no run of the mill case.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.700
And now not only has the press lost one of their own,

02:25.810 --> 02:28.060
they've lost a man who had a highly publicized,

02:28.150 --> 02:32.270
less-than-ideal relationship with our lieutenant hunt here.

02:32.340 --> 02:34.670
So they're anticipating a lay-down on this case.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.110
Less-than-ideal how?

02:37.180 --> 02:40.670
Harry,you haven't met sam tyler yet,have you?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.730
So you're the boy wonder?

02:42.820 --> 02:44.750
Harry woolf,chief of d'S.

02:44.840 --> 02:49.730
Now,guys,joey conway was as emblematic of new york city as stickball,

02:49.820 --> 02:51.840
hot dogs and the mets.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.330
And I didn't like him any more than some of you did.

02:54.410 --> 02:57.090
But if we blow this,they'll never let us forget it.

02:57.150 --> 03:02.360
This is under the glare,so let's make it clean,and let's make it count.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.460
And whoever cracks it,I'll see they get their due.

03:06.550 --> 03:07.460
Good to see ya.

03:13.440 --> 03:15.520
we got a twirl reporter in lost and found.

03:15.610 --> 03:17.620
She used to work with conway at the paper.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.180
Do I ever get to learn why gene hunt and joey conway were mortal enemies,ray?

03:21.240 --> 03:22.840
They didn't like each other,spaceman.

03:22.910 --> 03:23.550
Leave it at that.

03:23.640 --> 03:28.430
Some men just don't like each other-- cain and abel,ho chi minh and L.B.J.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.760
Me and you.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.820
I got you a cup of coffee,hon.

03:32.860 --> 03:34.300
You worked for the guy for three years.

03:34.390 --> 03:35.990
Did conway have any enemies?

03:36.070 --> 03:37.820
Enemies?

03:37.830 --> 03:40.370
honestly,I don't know if the man had any friends.

03:40.450 --> 03:44.480
His motto was,"make them all hate you,and then sleep till noon.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.700
" Any,angry readers do more than talk?

03:48.760 --> 03:52.260
One loon threw a cherry bomb into our office la month.

03:52.340 --> 03:53.560
We don't know for sure if it was for conway,

03:53.660 --> 04:00.450
but it was the day after his "ten reasons why the yankees are a joke" column.

04:00.530 --> 04:01.860
StilL...

04:01.950 --> 04:05.470
I can't believe somebody would kill conway on something that he wrote.

04:05.570 --> 04:07.950
Did he mention where he was going last night?

04:08.020 --> 04:10.170
He did.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.680
"A doll's life.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.529
" Preview was last night.

04:17.649 --> 04:22.050
The artist is this little cupcake I think joey was sweet on.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.270
Is that the cupcake's name?

04:24.510 --> 04:26.540
And why do you think joey was sweet on her?

04:26.630 --> 04:29.130
He had pictures of her all over his office.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.530
her,her work,articles.

04:31.610 --> 04:34.310
It was like a shrine.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.520
The victim's husband,tony crane,is a person of interest.

04:42.610 --> 04:43.820
who's responsible?

04:43.940 --> 04:44.950
Tony crane!

04:46.960 --> 04:48.560
spaceman!

04:49.940 --> 04:54.390
How about weaydream when we're not trying to solve the case that's gonna get me bumped up?

04:54.480 --> 04:55.580
yeah?

04:56.290 --> 04:57.120
What's that?

04:57.220 --> 04:58.130
Conway's fan mail.

04:58.220 --> 05:00.090
Found it in his office.

05:00.190 --> 05:02.610
He had a lot of people that did not like him.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.290
That's just from last month.

05:07.310 --> 05:09.070
That's from last year.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.480
"A doll's life.

05:21.060 --> 05:22.790
this is art?

05:22.870 --> 05:25.490
What happened to the classy stuff?

05:25.580 --> 05:28.650
Oil paintings of old ladies,bowls of fruit?

05:28.750 --> 05:31.630
Cigar-chomping bulldogs playing poker?

05:31.720 --> 05:33.130
We know who owns this place?

05:33.220 --> 05:34.800
that would be me.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.010
Nice to meet you.

05:37.340 --> 05:38.630
Tony crane.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.470
Detective ray carling.

05:46.300 --> 05:47.660
It's you.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.710
You're tony crane.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.340
My name is sam tyler.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.780
I was in an accident,and I woke up in 1973.

06:01.860 --> 06:05.220
I don't know how or why I'm here,but whatever's happened,

06:05.300 --> 06:07.430
it's like I've landed on a different planet.

06:07.500 --> 06:12.490
Now maybe if I can work out threason,I can get home.

You're tony crane£¿

06:20.890 --> 06:22.620
that I am.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.880
we're here to talk about joey conway.

06:24.970 --> 06:26.510
I still can't believe he's gone.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.710
Joey built this city,one word at a time.

06:29.780 --> 06:33.540
You're tony crane.

06:33.620 --> 06:37.780
I assume at some point there will be a little more to your line of questioning than this?

06:37.870 --> 06:40.330
tony crane.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.380
I'm sorry,do we know each other?

06:43.460 --> 06:44.790
we will.

06:44.850 --> 06:46.940
One day.

06:47.010 --> 06:49.990
We think joey conway might've stopped by here last night.

06:50.060 --> 06:52.250
he wahere at the preview,just for a bit.

06:52.330 --> 06:56.870
-And what time was that?-why did you do it?

06:56.940 --> 06:58.860
What time did conway stop by?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.580
it was around 8:00 or 8:30.

07:00.660 --> 07:02.230
He wasn't here for very long.

07:02.330 --> 07:05.740
I don't think the exhibit was really to his taste.

07:05.820 --> 07:06.860
Who knew?

07:06.930 --> 07:09.010
If I were to cut the heads off my G.I.Joe,

07:09.080 --> 07:11.690
glued it onto a chair,I coulve been an artist.

07:11.770 --> 07:18.290
and if I had a fright wig and a pancho villa lip piece,I could be a detective.

07:18.350 --> 07:19.500
just kidding.

07:19.590 --> 07:21.170
I love the look.

07:21.260 --> 07:22.680
Eve flannery.

07:22.900 --> 07:27.340
So you're the,creative force behind all this?

07:27.420 --> 07:28.600
That I am.

07:28.670 --> 07:34.970
And,yes,my misspent youth beheading dolls is what made me the artist I am today.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.780
These men are here about joey conway.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.810
how awful.

07:40.910 --> 07:42.730
Last night he was so...

07:42.820 --> 07:43.720
jolly.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.510
did conway say where he was going last night?

07:45.590 --> 07:47.430
I mean,any reason why he might've been on the "a" train?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.240
sam?

07:49.320 --> 07:50.740
It's tony crane.

07:50.810 --> 07:53.130
Joey wasn't much for sharing,

07:53.210 --> 07:56.390
and eve and I were up to our eyeballs in collectors.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.190
It was a virtual coronation.

07:59.290 --> 08:00.590
Hey,the opening is tomorrow night.

08:00.670 --> 08:01.870
You fellas should come.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.670
You son of a bitch.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.380
Tyler!

08:04.470 --> 08:05.450
I-I beg your pardon?

08:05.530 --> 08:07.780
We're arresting you for the murder of joey conway.

08:07.870 --> 08:08.470
-What?-We are?

08:08.470 --> 08:09.330
Based on what?

08:09.410 --> 08:14.260
Based on the fact that you're a piece of garbage that's gonna grow to be a greater piece of garbage.

08:14.330 --> 08:15.140
tyler!

08:15.230 --> 08:16.830
You dinged-out bastard!

08:16.910 --> 08:20.550
What the hl's the matter with you?

08:20.630 --> 08:22.290
I'm really sorry about this.

08:22.370 --> 08:25.880
Listen,if anything comes to mind regarding joey conway,please give me a call.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.370
-All right?Sorry.-Of course.Of course.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.850
let's go.

08:28.940 --> 08:32.650
clearly detective tyler is carrying the dark dog on his back.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.330
let's go!

08:34.840 --> 08:36.419
Get him some help.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.840
The man definitely had a gift.

08:38.929 --> 08:42.510
Conway wrote a column on the best and worst restaurants in new york.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.020
Best--none.

08:44.110 --> 08:46.320
Worst--this poor place called the athenian.

08:46.390 --> 08:52.400
Conway said,"the food is so bad,"the cockroaches carpooled to the kitch on the backs of the rats.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.330
" Well,he kept tapes on all of his interviews.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.770
So hopefully,there's something on there.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.840
We got nothin'.

08:58.910 --> 08:59.990
Nothin'!

09:00.080 --> 09:07.130
except for the fact that we now have irrefutable proof that this guy is one brady short of a bunch.

09:07.210 --> 09:08.320
Explain?

09:08.390 --> 09:12.300
He wilded-out on this gallery owner and his adorable little piece.

09:12.400 --> 09:16.270
He wanted to arrest the guy-- tried to arrest the guy for no reason!

09:16.350 --> 09:20.060
And why did you do that,detective tyler?

09:20.230 --> 09:21.670
Because I know him.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.930
And what did he do,boff your kid sister?

09:25.010 --> 09:29.400
And eat up all your chocolate candy while he was at it?

09:29.500 --> 09:32.520
People will try to arrest him.

09:32.580 --> 09:37.250
But he'll end up running an empire.

09:37.350 --> 09:39.210
But he has a thing...

09:39.310 --> 09:41.760
for young,female artists.

09:41.840 --> 09:45.490
He--he--he snares them and he supports them.

09:45.570 --> 09:48.910
And then...

09:51.470 --> 09:56.420
boss,did you ever look at someone you're sending down and wish you'd done it years ago?

09:56.500 --> 09:59.420
The eyes of the world are watching us.

09:59.500 --> 10:08.730
We do everything above board-- the way you are always squawking we should do things.

10:08.820 --> 10:13.070
We're making a case.

sam.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.250
Sam,help me.

10:35.980 --> 10:38.220
You promised you'd help me.

10:38.290 --> 10:39.390
Sam,help me.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.790
Why won't you help me?

10:41.880 --> 10:43.080
Help me,sam.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.190
Sam!

10:44.290 --> 10:45.850
Why,sam?

10:45.950 --> 10:47.110
Why,sam?

10:47.670 --> 10:49.780
****,detective.

10:49.860 --> 10:52.260
I just have a few more questions about the other night.

10:52.310 --> 10:56.920
Do I have your word you won't get all charlie manson again?

10:56.980 --> 10:58.580
Yeah.

11:03.310 --> 11:06.670
I just wanted to establish you were with tony all night at the preview.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.890
I was,all night.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.470
Listen to me.

11:13.550 --> 11:16.620
I owe it to myself to tell you this.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.720
Leave tony crane.

11:18.790 --> 11:21.720
Just go far away from him...

11:21.800 --> 11:25.090
because he will destroy you.

11:26.960 --> 11:30.330
You just don't know it yet.

11:30.400 --> 11:36.540
Not that it's any of your business,but tony loves me.

11:36.620 --> 11:39.510
And he believes in me.

11:39.590 --> 11:42.360
I come from a town in ohio so small,

11:42.440 --> 11:45.020
you could throw a rock from end to end.

11:45.090 --> 11:53.810
I arrived here with $200 and some silly dream of becoming an artist.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.370
Tony took me in.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.420
Tony believes in me...

11:57.480 --> 12:00.050
in my work.

12:00.540 --> 12:02.700
eve...

12:13.270 --> 12:18.250
when you work with these dolls...

12:18.330 --> 12:19.740
do you see yourself in them?

12:19.820 --> 12:21.070
Maybe.

12:21.170 --> 12:23.540
And yet,most of them...

12:23.620 --> 12:24.780
you mangle.

12:24.840 --> 12:32.880
Nothing pleases a girl more than to be psychoanalyzed by a psychopath.

12:36.460 --> 12:37.960
detective tyleR.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.430
This is ed redlich,tony crane's lawyer.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.680
Judge vincent just put downa restraining order.

12:42.730 --> 12:44.660
To keep crane away from eve?

12:44.740 --> 12:47.640
No,no,to keep you away from both of them,you lunatic.

12:47.720 --> 12:48.630
What?

12:48.710 --> 12:52.620
you apparently assaulted Mr.Crane in his gallery yesterday.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.660
And then this morning you forced your way into ms.Flannery's loft.

12:56.740 --> 12:58.700
I had-- I had to do something.

12:58.750 --> 13:02.360
Tyler,let me make myself imminently clear.

13:02.420 --> 13:03.570
Not only will you be arrested,

13:03.630 --> 13:08.520
but you will lose your badge if you come within 500 feet of either Mr.Crane or ms.Flannery.

13:08.590 --> 13:11.250
Now why don't you try to find the subway killer

13:11.320 --> 13:17.810
and quit harassing some of our most upstanding citizens?

13:20.960 --> 13:22.790
Gene,you gotta believe me.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.150
This guy is bad news.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.190
M pretty sure he's good for the conway homicide,

13:27.260 --> 13:33.060
and if we don't do something,he's gonna kill this girl.

13:33.140 --> 13:36.450
No more fancy hunches.

13:38.390 --> 13:40.410
Let's--let's pull him in.

13:40.490 --> 13:43.480
Put the squeeze on,gene hunt-style.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.240
I...

13:45.340 --> 13:47.210
why can't we do what you always do?

13:47.290 --> 13:50.290
Because for the first time ever,tyler,

13:50.370 --> 13:56.810
I'm policing in the full glare of the public eye.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.790
Did you know conway wrote a puff piece about eve flannery?

14:01.860 --> 14:05.550
He spent two weeks with her as she was getting ready for her first show at the whitney.

14:05.620 --> 14:09.330
I wonder what crane felt about that.

14:09.410 --> 14:15.040
What is it with you and this tony crane?

14:15.920 --> 14:17.550
His wife...

14:17.630 --> 14:21.060
penny margolis sh uH...

14:21.150 --> 14:24.300
she worked exclusively with oils.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.690
Wild stuff.

14:28.470 --> 14:31.310
Multi-panel paintings...

14:31.410 --> 14:33.440
of rain.

14:33.510 --> 14:35.300
She painted rain.

14:35.380 --> 14:38.140
Her career just started to take off,and she came to me.

14:38.230 --> 14:43.340
She said she was scared that tony wasn't well...

14:43.410 --> 14:45.080
that he'd hit her...

14:45.170 --> 14:47.780
and worse.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.630
So I did everything I could legally do,you know?

14:49.720 --> 14:53.620
I-I got a restraining order...

14:53.690 --> 14:58.770
when he found out that I tried to get her to leave...

14:58.860 --> 15:03.140
she died because of me.

15:04.050 --> 15:08.290
Are we talking about the future again?

15:09.420 --> 15:14.430
We need to start kicking in doors and bashing heads.

15:14.570 --> 15:15.800
what?

15:15.890 --> 15:17.040
I guess it was just a trick of the light,

15:17.150 --> 15:21.580
but for a moment there,you looked exactly like the loot.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.300
"The die has been cast.

15:23.370 --> 15:26.210
" "you will pay for what you did.

15:26.280 --> 15:27.800
That's greek!The guy is greek.

15:27.890 --> 15:30.910
There are dozens of threatening letters all with the same handwriting.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.050
How do you know he's greek?

15:32.130 --> 15:34.850
I used to pour the pork to a greek chick back at the academy.

15:34.920 --> 15:35.450
Lovely.

15:35.540 --> 15:38.490
What was the column you read yesterday about the best and worst restaurants?

15:38.560 --> 15:40.600
Wasn't the worst of the worst a greek place?

15:40.650 --> 15:42.080
It was.It was.

15:42.180 --> 15:44.470
I don't know if I have it.

15:46.910 --> 15:49.920
And the worst place to eat in new york--the athenian.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.770
"The food is so bad "that even the vermin steer clear of the stale baklava "and undercooked lamb.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.510
" I can't imagine the owner would be happy with that review.Come on.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.270
Let's go!

16:00.900 --> 16:02.330
good afternoon.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.450
Can you tell us where we might find demitri pantos?

16:04.550 --> 16:07.330
We wanna talk to him.

16:09.580 --> 16:12.160
we wanted to ask him a few questions.

16:12.270 --> 16:13.050
Like...

16:13.140 --> 16:19.180
is it still called souvlaki if it's not on the skewer?

16:26.800 --> 16:28.820
Police!

16:33.610 --> 16:34.930
Police!

16:35.030 --> 16:36.460
Joey conway ruined me!

16:36.530 --> 16:38.060
He ruined me!He deserved to die!

16:38.130 --> 16:39.940
Put the knife down,demitri.Do it now.

16:40.010 --> 16:42.090
No.Do not come closer!

16:42.140 --> 16:44.110
Do not come clos!

16:46.620 --> 16:48.160
Good job,kid.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.340
Lamb.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.110
Well done.

16:50.190 --> 16:53.510
Demitri pantos,you're under arrest for the murder of joseph conway.

16:53.570 --> 16:55.930
No,ray!No!

16:56.030 --> 16:59.080
Boss,he killed a man.

16:59.590 --> 17:00.630
Okay.

17:00.730 --> 17:01.470
Huh?

17:01.550 --> 17:02.870
But just one.

17:02.940 --> 17:04.829
And don't leave a mark.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.109
tape recorder?

17:14.180 --> 17:17.000
To ensure the appearance of propriety.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.869
The loot wants this on the up and up.

17:19.920 --> 17:20.980
Professional langue.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.829
Professional conduct.

17:25.130 --> 17:27.530
October 6,1973.

17:27.589 --> 17:31.760
The interrogation of demitri pantos.

17:35.170 --> 17:39.710
We know you were joey conway's most devoted pen pal.

17:39.790 --> 17:44.130
Over 200 letters detailing the many ways you wanted to kill him.

17:44.190 --> 17:48.670
We have eyewitnesses tying you to the cherry bomb that got tossed in his office.

17:48.730 --> 17:51.110
He was a eunuch pig...

17:51.180 --> 17:52.730
just like you.

17:52.870 --> 17:59.030
That's how you wanna start this,you greasy moussaka?!

17:59.100 --> 18:01.160
erase that.Back it up.

18:03.710 --> 18:04.980
okay.

18:06.300 --> 18:09.310
Conway poked at your business with his article,so you poked back.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.980
The only one I want to poke is,your wife.

18:13.060 --> 18:15.640
Easy,ray!Ray,easy!

18:19.460 --> 18:20.860
for god sake.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.110
conway said that he was being followed,and that's what you did.

18:33.210 --> 18:35.300
You followed him into the subway and you stabbed him!

18:35.380 --> 18:36.550
I followed him.

18:36.630 --> 18:40.410
I followed him to see how this son of a whore could get through the day

18:40.470 --> 18:44.700
after destroying the lives of hardworking people.

18:44.740 --> 18:45.910
Where did he go that day?

18:45.990 --> 18:52.210
To the office,to,the hot dog stand,to the hotel marco,

18:52.320 --> 18:55.130
and he stayed a long time,so I left.

18:55.210 --> 18:57.440
Did anybody see you leave?

18:57.530 --> 19:00.340
Where did you go after that?

19:00.430 --> 19:02.150
Can someone give you an alibi?

19:02.230 --> 19:03.130
No alibi.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.860
My truth is my truth.

19:04.940 --> 19:07.600
Truth?Like this?My truth?

19:11.180 --> 19:13.760
I see things are going well.

19:18.850 --> 19:20.740
I have nothing to say.

19:20.820 --> 19:23.260
Conway is dead.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.090
And may the devil piss on his corpse.

19:26.180 --> 19:29.200
I'll drink to that.

19:29.290 --> 19:33.480
Joey conway wrote a piece on me,too.

19:33.550 --> 19:35.850
Almost ended my career.

19:35.930 --> 19:40.460
I policed these streets 28 years.

19:40.530 --> 19:47.750
all down the toilet cause of the lies that man told.

19:47.810 --> 19:49.240
They call it...

19:49.310 --> 19:50.730
an expos?

19:50.810 --> 19:54.110
about police brutality.

19:54.180 --> 19:55.620
It wasn't all lies.

19:55.680 --> 19:58.900
The truth I would never run away from,but the lies.

19:58.900 --> 20:07.770
my--my restaurant used to have lines out the door til that malaka,conway.

20:07.850 --> 20:10.600
We--we can't break even on a friday night.

20:10.650 --> 20:14.200
I've taken bullets for these streets.

20:14.270 --> 20:19.960
I've been beaten,bloodied,stabbed,strangled and spindled.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.160
I never once regretted any of it,

20:22.240 --> 20:25.600
because I joined up to safeguard the city I love.

20:25.660 --> 20:28.110
Joey loved the city,too.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.400
But his way was to write about it.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.880
Way was to bleed for it.

20:31.950 --> 20:36.940
But after that-- that piece came out,well,the people just...

20:37.010 --> 20:41.060
spat in my face.

20:41.130 --> 20:47.350
He humilted me,demitri,like you.

20:47.420 --> 20:51.730
Three generations of pantos built that restaurant.

20:51.790 --> 20:56.750
Everything your grandparents built-- gone because of that man?

20:56.820 --> 21:02.150
I did what any real man would do...

21:02.210 --> 21:04.120
for the pantos name.

21:04.190 --> 21:08.640
We stood around and watched,but you stood up to him.

21:08.730 --> 21:10.100
YeS.

21:10.930 --> 21:13.260
You did it for family.

21:13.400 --> 21:14.540
YeS.

21:14.610 --> 21:15.550
Yes.

21:15.620 --> 21:16.600
You stood up to him!

21:16.680 --> 21:18.000
-You killed him!
-Yes!

21:18.030 --> 21:19.450
You killed that fat bastard!

21:19.520 --> 21:20.750
Yes,I did!

21:20.830 --> 21:21.710
I killed him!

21:21.790 --> 21:26.860
I killed him,and I'd do it again!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.330
sam,I heard he confessed.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.240
He did.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.620
But something's not right.

21:31.700 --> 21:35.330
Pantos mentioned following conway to the hotel marco the day of his murder.

21:35.410 --> 21:36.350
Would you check it out for me?

21:36.410 --> 21:39.120
I would,but hunt's watching me like I'm the zapruder film,

21:39.210 --> 21:41.500
-you know?-Is this about tony crane?

21:41.570 --> 21:45.130
They're holding a press conference tomorrow to announce the arrest on the conway homicide.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.390
We're running out of time.

21:46.450 --> 21:48.210
Do you have a motive?

21:48.310 --> 21:50.170
No,I don'T.

21:50.250 --> 21:53.530
So you want me following up on leads based on your unfounded hunches?

21:53.600 --> 21:57.900
I know you don't believe how or why I come to the conclusions I do,

21:57.960 --> 22:01.160
but ve i steered you wrong yet?

22:03.770 --> 22:07.550
Now conway's hanging in the meatpacking district with transvestites

22:07.600 --> 22:09.830
-- you know,annas with bananas.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.920
yeah,they're packing meat,all right.

22:11.970 --> 22:14.480
Why are we still listening to conway's tapes?

22:14.520 --> 22:16.200
We--we got a confession from pantos.

22:16.250 --> 22:19.750
Yeah,who's as confused as a baby in a topless bar.

22:19.810 --> 22:24.240
The boss set up the press conference for tomorrow ratr than today to give us time to find more evidence

22:24.300 --> 22:26.190
that pantos was threatening conway.

22:26.320 --> 22:29.730
Well,speaking of confused...

22:29.860 --> 22:31.230
I'm a little worried about sam.

22:31.310 --> 22:33.080
He's acting kind of...nuts.

22:33.170 --> 22:34.680
When is he not acting nuts?

22:34.750 --> 22:36.940
When he starts to act normal,then you should worry.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.170
What?

22:38.230 --> 22:39.140
What?

22:39.210 --> 22:40.430
What is it?

22:40.490 --> 22:42.010
It's nothing.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.720
just more tranny talk.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.950
if he thinks I'm leaving him,he'll kill me.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.020
Tell me what to do,sam.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.490
thank you,Mr.Capote.

23:43.470 --> 23:46.460
I thought I was clear.I don't need saving.

23:46.530 --> 23:49.640
You remind me of a girl-- an artist who painted rain.

23:49.700 --> 23:53.360
And one day,there were no more paintings,and it was because of tony.

23:53.420 --> 23:56.250
What are you talking about?

23:59.290 --> 24:00.490
Tony crane.

24:00.550 --> 24:02.190
Detective tyler.

24:02.270 --> 24:06.400
I'm arresting you on suspicion of being a murdering rat bastard.

24:06.450 --> 24:08.620
No,I believe you are the one who's going to be arrested.

24:08.690 --> 24:09.430
Really?

24:09.490 --> 24:11.720
After all,I have a restraining order.

24:19.350 --> 24:23.510
The one time we had to play by the rules,and you do this?

24:23.570 --> 24:25.000
Gene,crane is our guy.

24:25.050 --> 24:26.710
You are under arrest.

24:26.770 --> 24:28.640
No,you don't know what he's capable of.

24:28.720 --> 24:32.580
You don't know what he's done-- I mean,what he's going to do.

24:32.670 --> 24:33.470
None of you do!

24:33.540 --> 24:34.360
None of you!

24:34.440 --> 24:35.340
Eve?!

24:35.460 --> 24:36.590
Eve!

24:36.680 --> 24:38.040
Eve?!

24:43.270 --> 24:45.170
sam...

24:45.250 --> 24:47.140
I know.

24:49.330 --> 24:52.360
I followed up on that hotel.

24:52.460 --> 24:57.180
The desk clerk said that conway checked in the afternoon he died with a woman.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.020
Did he--did he get her name?

24:59.100 --> 24:59.920
No.

24:59.970 --> 25:04.100
He only saw her in passing,but the descriptive matched eve.

25:04.180 --> 25:05.510
They were having an affair.

25:05.580 --> 25:06.300
Crane found out.

25:06.370 --> 25:07.480
That gives him motive for murder.

25:07.550 --> 25:08.760
That doesn't make sense though.

25:08.820 --> 25:10.240
You didn't know joey conway.

25:10.300 --> 25:14.460
He was a family-type guy,a-a salt of the earth irishman.

25:14.520 --> 25:19.840
Yo-you said yoput tony crane away in the future.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.690
How'd you do it?

25:21.770 --> 25:24.430
Well,he was arrogant beyond belief.

25:24.510 --> 25:28.710
He kept the murder weapon-- the knife--in his laptop bag.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.320
What's a "laptop bag"?

25:30.380 --> 25:31.370
It's a bag...

25:31.450 --> 25:34.230
where you keep your laptop.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.460
right.Yeah.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.270
okay.

25:37.340 --> 25:41.620
Someday,annie,computers will be the same size as notebooks.

25:41.690 --> 25:43.430
Notebook-sized computers.

25:43.500 --> 25:47.230
'Cause in the future,smaller is better,and these notebook-sized computers help you to do things,

25:47.290 --> 25:50.270
like office chores,send messages to friends...

25:50.340 --> 25:51.590
easily find...

25:51.640 --> 25:53.270
porn.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.290
What time is the press conference?

25:59.340 --> 26:00.640
Noon.

26:11.400 --> 26:16.000
I was wondering when you'd come by to gloat.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.670
In a few hours,the loot's gonna make a fool of himself,

26:19.740 --> 26:26.770
'cause unlike you,he has the wrong key to the right keyhole.

26:29.220 --> 26:30.800
why are you doing this?

26:30.880 --> 26:33.900
Not for you,spaceman.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.140
But on this particular occasion,

26:36.230 --> 26:42.400
the boss needs a little help from the lunatic fringe.

26:48.310 --> 26:49.670
I should call the cops.

26:49.730 --> 26:50.570
I need to know.

26:50.640 --> 26:55.680
You and joey conway-- are you lovers?

26:55.730 --> 26:57.920
Lovers?

26:58.000 --> 27:03.660
I know you were with him at the hotel the day he died.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.920
joey was smart...

27:07.990 --> 27:11.940
perceptive,like you.

27:12.030 --> 27:15.380
He asked me to meet in secret at the hotel.

27:15.440 --> 27:19.810
When I got there,he told me I should leave tony.

27:19.860 --> 27:24.580
He wasaying all kinds of things,how he'd done some research about other girls

27:24.640 --> 27:29.150
-- girls from the old days,girls who'd vanished,an artist called anya,

27:29.210 --> 27:32.870
another one called vandy.

27:32.950 --> 27:38.090
Joey claimed ty did horrible things to them.

27:39.810 --> 27:44.650
He got me a train ticket,a place to stay.

27:44.770 --> 27:47.770
I couldn't do it.

27:47.870 --> 27:50.920
I thought about it.

27:52.550 --> 27:56.030
Tony found out...

28:01.650 --> 28:05.510
I got a piece of conway's scarf here.

28:05.590 --> 28:08.990
Put this in his closet or office,somewhere private.

28:09.060 --> 28:10.570
I'll take care of the rest.

28:10.650 --> 28:12.230
Why?

28:12.350 --> 28:16.220
So I can find it when I lead a police raid in about an hour.

28:16.310 --> 28:18.540
You want me to plant evidence?

28:18.630 --> 28:20.790
It's what has to be done.

28:20.860 --> 28:23.580
Conway was right.Tony is a murderer.

28:23.610 --> 28:25.460
He stabbed joey conway to death.

28:25.530 --> 28:26.050
No.

28:26.130 --> 28:28.050
You know this,eve.

28:28.130 --> 28:29.950
I know no such thing.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.720
Think back--the night of the preview.

28:31.790 --> 28:34.580
Was there a period of time when you didn't see tony?

28:34.670 --> 28:43.390
I know if you think hard,you can remember a half-hour period where you just plain didn't see him.

28:43.770 --> 28:47.690
I leave you for two minutes,babe,and this is how I find you?

28:47.780 --> 28:50.520
No.Ease.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.130
Look at me.

28:55.270 --> 28:56.650
Please.

28:58.260 --> 28:59.890
she had nothing to do with this.

28:59.970 --> 29:01.510
What are you gonna do,huh?

29:01.580 --> 29:03.270
No gun,no badge.

29:03.370 --> 29:07.280
Not so big now,are you?

29:18.850 --> 29:21.060
what's funny?

29:21.070 --> 29:22.570
Yeah...

29:25.240 --> 29:28.800
I was hit by a car...in 2008.

29:28.880 --> 29:32.780
And what sucks for you is that I woke up here,

29:32.860 --> 29:37.330
midway through your secret history.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.190
You're saying you're from the future?

29:39.300 --> 29:40.850
I am.

29:40.940 --> 29:49.670
And I arrested you then for a horrible murder of a beautiful young artist.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.930
You're crazier than I thought.

29:55.250 --> 29:58.580
I'm done with you.

29:59.620 --> 30:02.630
The cops will find you dead.

30:02.730 --> 30:05.860
I'll say you broke in...

30:05.950 --> 30:08.930
threatened eve-- tony,no.

30:17.220 --> 30:22.830
You are a monster,and you will only get worse.

30:22.920 --> 30:25.190
I know what you become in the future.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.840
The future?

30:26.960 --> 30:30.480
What the hell are you talking about?

30:31.410 --> 30:34.700
The quick resolution to the murder of joey conway

30:34.780 --> 30:39.650
is due to the dedication and resourcefulness of my team.

30:39.710 --> 30:41.630
Detective ray carling,

30:41.710 --> 30:46.000
who led the investigation,will answer any questions you might have.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.360
thank you.

30:53.850 --> 30:55.240
hold up!

30:55.780 --> 30:59.000
I got the man who murdered joey conway.

30:59.090 --> 31:00.710
-detective tyler!-He's the one you want.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.620
Tony crane!

31:14.280 --> 31:16.380
Give me something!

31:17.670 --> 31:19.770
No comment.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.210
you escaped from our cell,

31:37.290 --> 31:40.410
you embarrassed this houseat the press conference,

31:40.760 --> 31:44.110
and for the second time in two days,you violated a restraining order.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.200
There's nothing I can do for you now,tyler.

31:46.320 --> 31:48.720
Crane killed joey conway.

31:48.810 --> 31:50.680
Need I remind you we have our man?

31:50.760 --> 31:53.590
Demitri pantos threatened conway.

31:53.680 --> 31:57.220
Tony crane might've had it in for him,too.

31:57.320 --> 31:58.610
What?

31:58.700 --> 32:00.540
It was on one of conway's tapes.

32:00.620 --> 32:03.460
He said he started to worry about crane.

32:03.540 --> 32:06.150
And conway was trying to convince eve to leave crane.

32:06.240 --> 32:09.530
you release my client immediately,or I am going to sue the 1-2-5.

32:09.630 --> 32:11.370
Why didn't you say something sooner?

32:11.450 --> 32:13.210
Well,I-I wasn't really sure at first,

32:13.290 --> 32:16.240
but tyler seemed like he was ono something,so that's why I let him out.

32:16.310 --> 32:17.050
You know what?Just for the hell of it,

32:17.140 --> 32:19.450
I'm gonna--I'm gonna sue you,too,lieutenant hunt.

32:19.540 --> 32:20.490
Shut up.

32:21.530 --> 32:22.540
-sir.
-No,and--and I'm also gonna file charges against

32:22.620 --> 32:23.760
-detective tyler here for harassment,assault...
-not now,no-nuts.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.380
-Please,sir
-later,norris.

32:25.450 --> 32:29.570
And conspiracy to plant evidence-- speaking of evidence...

32:29.660 --> 32:30.690
norris,what are you doing?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.850
This is tony crane's typewriter.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.850
It helps him do things like office chores and sending messages to friends.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.320
And hidden here...

32:39.410 --> 32:43.020
in this little compartment...

32:46.570 --> 32:48.540
laptop,'73 style.

32:48.630 --> 32:51.250
Where did you--how did-- clearly--clearly that's just more planted evidence.

32:51.330 --> 32:52.500
I mean,good god,harry.

32:52.590 --> 32:54.080
What,is your whole department in on this?

32:54.160 --> 32:57.200
Keep your shirt on.

32:58.380 --> 32:59.980
Is that your typewriter?

33:00.060 --> 33:01.360
-I can explain.
-It's-- yeah,b-but,no,

33:01.450 --> 33:03.430
even if it is,it's inadmissible.

33:03.510 --> 33:04.940
You didn't have a search warrant.

33:05.010 --> 33:06.530
I diD.

33:06.600 --> 33:10.660
It turns out there were reports of drug activity at the gallery opening last night,

33:10.740 --> 33:16.620
so i secured a warrant,went in and searched the premises and found this.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.020
The chief of d's said keep it clean.

33:19.100 --> 33:20.130
-It's clean.
-yeah.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.590
Yeah,well,we'll see about that.

33:21.660 --> 33:22.750
It won't stick.

33:22.820 --> 33:24.500
You know why?

33:24.730 --> 33:30.030
Your detective is insane,totally loco.

33:30.100 --> 33:36.530
Go on,tyler.Get it off your chest.I know you want to.

33:36.630 --> 33:40.560
Tell 'em,tyler,or I will.

33:40.640 --> 33:42.640
Tell us what?

33:42.720 --> 33:46.990
Sam tyler is from the future.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.600
what are you talking about?

33:48.670 --> 33:50.080
he's a time traveler...

33:50.160 --> 33:51.500
sort of.

33:51.570 --> 33:52.780
Go on,sam.Tell 'em.

33:52.860 --> 33:55.570
They know you're a madman.You can't hide it anymore.

33:55.640 --> 33:57.540
Tell 'em.

34:03.730 --> 34:08.580
I'm from 35 years in the future.

34:08.670 --> 34:13.179
he has a car accident and wakes up here.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.500
And there's another tony crane.

34:15.580 --> 34:20.030
He's in the future,and he kills some woman-- some 2008 woman,

34:20.110 --> 34:23.179
which is why tyler is so hell-bent on stopping me now.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.159
I mean,woW.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.460
So now what do you say,gene?

34:27.540 --> 34:32.070
Where'd he get all those ideas?

34:32.190 --> 34:35.020
I don't know,boss.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.040
Mr.Crane told me all this.

34:37.150 --> 34:39.630
Okay,okay,don't start playing games now,tyler.

34:39.710 --> 34:43.650
But clearly,only a severely deranged and mentally disturbed man

34:43.790 --> 34:47.300
would come up with such a bizarre excuse to discredit the arresting officer.

34:47.380 --> 34:49.429
All right,all right,this--this is ridiculous.

34:49.500 --> 34:52.110
Wait,are you telling me that you don't think he's crazy?

34:52.179 --> 34:52.989
Come on!

34:53.050 --> 34:55.960
You know he is!

35:08.130 --> 35:11.620
Mr.Crane...

35:11.740 --> 35:19.090
I think we need to put you someplace quiet until a doctor can look at you.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.240
Wait,wait,wait,wait.Wait--wait a minute.

35:20.360 --> 35:24.040
You're not gonna-- it's clinical detention for his own safety,

35:24.100 --> 35:26.460
under article 9 of the mental health act.

35:26.530 --> 35:29.700
you can't do this.

35:29.770 --> 35:33.190
Let's get a doc up here,

35:33.260 --> 35:37.100
with a big sedative,and you can get some rest.

35:37.170 --> 35:39.501
-All right,let's go.Let's go,napoleon.
-Stop it!

35:39.640 --> 35:42.430
-where'd you park your spaceship?
-I will get out!You can't stop me!

35:42.480 --> 35:44.380
Wait!

35:48.380 --> 35:51.850
I just did.

35:53.760 --> 35:54.370
let's go.Let's go.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.040
-stop it!Stop it!-let's go!

35:56.110 --> 35:58.580
I will get out!

36:12.570 --> 36:16.100
in a startling turn of events,new york's finest,

36:16.180 --> 36:18.690
who had claimed they found the murderer of joey conway,

36:18.770 --> 36:22.940
backtracked when all evidence pointed to art world luminary tony crane.

36:23.010 --> 36:26.420
to hell with the press.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.730
Eve.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.950
You only saw the monster,

36:40.020 --> 36:46.360
but like all of us,there was more to him than that.

36:49.900 --> 36:55.200
go make yourself a great life,eve.

37:00.450 --> 37:11.870
*wished I could be in your heart,to be one with your love*

37:11.930 --> 37:23.330
*wished I could be in your eyes,looking back there you were*

37:23.780 --> 37:28.660
you have to wonder why she didn't see it-- tony's other side.

37:28.730 --> 37:34.930
Or was it just that he could help her with her career,so she decided to look the other way?

37:35.010 --> 37:36.290
Or maybe...

37:36.360 --> 37:38.480
well,you spend enough time with a crazy person,

37:38.550 --> 37:42.770
and eventually,some of their madness rubs off on you a little.

37:42.850 --> 37:45.860
That sounds vaguely accusatory.

37:45.930 --> 37:48.660
The more time I spend with you,the dizzier I get.

37:48.750 --> 37:50.270
Well,maybe that's not madness.

37:50.340 --> 37:53.250
Maybe that's something else.

37:53.370 --> 37:58.080
I thought tony crane was the arrogant one.

37:59.380 --> 38:03.400
do you think maybe you...

38:03.500 --> 38:07.060
changed the future for the better?

38:07.140 --> 38:12.610
Saved e and others and tony's wife in 2008?

38:12.690 --> 38:14.630
I don't know.

38:14.690 --> 38:17.850
A lot can happen in 35 years.

38:17.920 --> 38:24.110
I just have to be happy with what I can change now,I guess.

38:24.180 --> 38:25.770
yeah.

38:26.760 --> 38:31.430
Save the laptops for later.
