WEBVTT

00:04.308 --> 00:06.528
Please hurry, Ms. Keen.
He doesn't like
to be kept waiting.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.312
Is this how it works
around here?

00:08.486 --> 00:10.575
He snaps his fingers
and everyone
just trembles?

00:12.186 --> 00:12.838
If they have
any sense.

00:14.753 --> 00:15.841
-Aren't you coming?
-Mm.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.809
Ah.
Thank God you're here.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.812
The boys and I were chatting
about failed expectations.

00:29.986 --> 00:32.162
I'll catch you up.
First I said...

00:32.336 --> 00:34.686
"Kansas was
an awful bloodbath,

00:34.860 --> 00:37.472
"and, sure, that was fun,
but you let Reddington
get away."

00:37.646 --> 00:40.301
Then they said,
"So sorry.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.216
"We promise to do better
next time.

00:42.390 --> 00:44.653
"Please, Neville,
what about
my wife and kids?"

00:44.827 --> 00:47.177
To which I said,
"Wife and kids?

00:47.351 --> 00:50.093
"What about my wife?
What about my kids?"

00:51.399 --> 00:52.878
You're insane!

00:56.012 --> 00:59.363
Why? Because I stabbed a man
who was suffocating?

00:59.537 --> 01:01.844
I suppose that was
rather crazy of me.

01:02.018 --> 01:03.541
Almost as crazy
as partnering
with an FBI agent.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.891
No... No!

01:08.329 --> 01:10.418
You find him
at his girlfriend's.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.769
You have him at gunpoint,
but somehow he gets away.

01:13.943 --> 01:15.640
Why is that?

01:15.814 --> 01:17.294
Why don't I have
everything you promised me,
Agent Keen?

01:21.864 --> 01:23.257
I have a lead.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.519
On Reddington.

01:24.693 --> 01:27.087
I can prove he's N-13

01:27.261 --> 01:29.045
and that he's in communication
with the Russians.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.395
Do you, now?

01:31.569 --> 01:33.397
I suppose there's only
one way to find out.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.921
Go. Pursue.
Live the dream.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.053
But, Elizabeth...

01:38.707 --> 01:40.143
Don't disappoint me again.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.446
Anne? Stay with me.

02:26.885 --> 02:29.714
Belsky reached out.
He said it's urgent.

02:32.021 --> 02:33.849
Anne had a daughter.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.720
Has a daughter.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.201
You must put that
behind you.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.072
Belsky has information

02:40.247 --> 02:42.466
that concerns
Townsend and Elizabeth.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.903
Then I suppose
we'll act on it.

02:45.077 --> 02:45.730
Raymond,
there's something else.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.038
Paula called.

02:49.212 --> 02:51.214
Glen's mother, Paula?

02:51.388 --> 02:54.652
Yes. She wanted you to call
or come by the house.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.220
And then she said something
about "new irons in the fire."

02:57.394 --> 02:59.483
Hot ones, she said.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.485
Oh, my God.
Sounds like she's dating.

03:01.659 --> 03:03.487
That's what I said.

03:03.661 --> 03:06.186
And she laughed and said,
"No, nothing like that.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.405
"This is business.

03:08.579 --> 03:10.842
"Serious business."

03:11.016 --> 03:13.410
And then she said,
"All right, then, Dembe.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.412
"I'll see you and Raymond
at the house."

03:15.586 --> 03:16.761
What happened
to Bill and Steven?

03:18.633 --> 03:20.417
She knows, Raymond.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.292
Oh, my.

03:29.905 --> 03:31.298
Histiaeus.

03:31.472 --> 03:32.777
What's to be learned
from him,

03:32.951 --> 03:34.910
other than tyranny
and duplicity?

03:35.084 --> 03:37.304
There you have it.
The history of mankind...

03:37.478 --> 03:39.088
Tyranny and duplicity.

03:39.262 --> 03:41.525
You've come a long way

03:41.699 --> 03:43.745
from the 8th Directorate,
comrade...

03:43.919 --> 03:45.529
Uh, Professor Belsky.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.227
Although I see your affinity

03:47.401 --> 03:50.317
for authoritarians
hasn't changed.

03:50.491 --> 03:53.537
Histiaeus wanted
to organize a revolt,

03:53.711 --> 03:56.801
but feared discovery
by the Persians,

03:56.975 --> 03:59.935
so he shaved the hair
of his favorite slave

04:00.109 --> 04:03.286
and had the treasonous message
tattooed on his head.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.809
When the hair grew back,

04:04.983 --> 04:06.594
he sent him off
to spread the word,

04:06.768 --> 04:08.813
which became
the first recorded act

04:08.987 --> 04:11.512
of steganography
in warfare.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.731
Of course, my KGB ciphers

04:13.905 --> 04:17.126
are no more relevant today
than tattooing a head,

04:17.300 --> 04:19.563
so you can imagine
my surprise

04:19.737 --> 04:21.043
when I stumbled
across this.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.353
<i>I don't understand.</i>

04:26.527 --> 04:27.876
Are you getting leads
from a psychic now?

04:28.050 --> 04:29.660
To predict the future?
I don't know, Harold.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.488
At $5.99 a minute,

04:31.662 --> 04:34.535
Madame Zorba
might be a bargain
at twice the price.

04:34.709 --> 04:37.277
If there was
a Madame Zorba.
But there isn't.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.061
You're showing me
a fake ad?

04:39.235 --> 04:41.106
It's not an ad.
It's a message.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.806
A code that I believe
Townsend and Elizabeth
may be using

04:44.980 --> 04:47.199
to communicate
with an associate.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.202
"Love is a knot that
even death cannot untie."

04:50.377 --> 04:52.379
It sounds more
like a Hallmark card
than a code.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.685
Having failed
to kill me,

04:54.859 --> 04:57.384
I suspect Elizabeth
and Townsend
may be planning

04:57.558 --> 04:59.386
to move against those
around me.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.303
In my world
and possibly in yours.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.826
Her fight is with you,
not us.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.568
Yes, but you're with me,

05:07.742 --> 05:09.570
and she's with Townsend,

05:09.744 --> 05:11.615
who takes great pride
in displaying

05:11.789 --> 05:14.662
his utter disregard
for human life.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.404
"Love is a knot"
isn't an aphorism.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.842
It's a clue
to decrypting the code.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.801
<i>As you well know,
during the Cold War,</i>

05:23.975 --> 05:28.415
<i>nobody mastered the art
of clandestine communication
better than the Soviets,</i>

05:28.589 --> 05:32.157
<i>their piece de resistance
being a cipher machine</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:35.030
<i>capable of encrypting
or decrypting text</i>

05:35.204 --> 05:37.685
<i>into ten different
languages.</i>

05:37.859 --> 05:40.557
The <i>Russkiy Uzel...
The Russian Knot.</i>

05:40.731 --> 05:42.298
<i>The Kremlin destroyed
most of them</i>

05:42.472 --> 05:44.909
<i>just prior to the fall
of the Soviet Union,</i>

05:45.083 --> 05:48.696
<i>so Lord knows how Townsend
got his hands on one,</i>

05:48.870 --> 05:51.612
but clearly he did,
and if we want to
decrypt that message,

05:51.786 --> 05:53.744
we need to get one, too.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.877
Somehow I don't think
this is something
we can order on Amazon.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.444
The only other machine
I know of

05:57.618 --> 06:00.185
is on display
in a museum in Minsk.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.753
Beautiful city.
Amazing opera house.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.887
I'd forgotten how beautiful
until yesterday.

06:06.061 --> 06:07.889
-You were just in Minsk?
-Yes.

06:08.063 --> 06:14.069
In order to make a generous
donation to said museum
from a private collection.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.245
Nana was born in Minsk.

06:16.419 --> 06:21.337
I can think of no better way
to honor her passing
than with this gift.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.078
You gave the museum
a Cezanne?

06:23.252 --> 06:24.601
A stolen one,

06:24.775 --> 06:27.865
which, like all good
and greedy bureaucrats,

06:28.039 --> 06:30.346
they're trying to decide
whether to report.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.696
Imagine their embarrassment

06:32.870 --> 06:35.482
when the FBI finds it
in their possession.

06:35.656 --> 06:37.048
You donated
the painting.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.659
Now you want us
to go and get it back.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.792
Yes. Along with
the Russian Knot.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.925
And why would they
give us that?

06:44.099 --> 06:47.537
Last I checked, your country
had sanctions in place

06:47.711 --> 06:50.366
against both the president
of Belarus and his son.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.976
They're not giving you
anything.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.762
-You want us to steal it.
-Of course.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.416
What the hell do you think
we've been talking about?

07:02.900 --> 07:04.206
Okay,
this cipher machine

07:04.380 --> 07:05.816
is actually
pretty fascinating.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.253
You use the little keyboard
to type up your message,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.821
which it then jumbles
into a random series
of letters.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.954
Then, on the receiving end,
you need another machine

07:13.128 --> 07:15.304
to turn the gobbledygook
back into regular text.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.262
Okay,
but this thing's
like 50 years old.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.961
I mean, can't you crack
the billboard code without it?

07:20.135 --> 07:22.354
Well, it's not exactly
Orphan Annie's decoder ring.

07:22.529 --> 07:24.922
The complexity of the Knot's
algorithm compounds

07:25.096 --> 07:26.968
every letter
after it is entered,

07:27.142 --> 07:30.058
netting us a trillion,
trillion, trillion...

07:30.232 --> 07:31.886
[KEY CLACKS, BEEPING]...different possibilities.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.758
I know we'd like
to find out what Keen
and Townsend are up to,

07:34.932 --> 07:37.326
but are we really
talking about robbing
the Belarusian War Museum?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.371
I, uh... I feel like
we've done worse.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.244
Reddington made it clear
there's no diplomatic angle
here.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.941
Townsend has
illicit relationships

07:44.115 --> 07:45.116
with the Council
of Ministers.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.118
If we reach out for help,
he'll be tipped.

07:47.292 --> 07:50.382
Yeah, but to what?
We don't even know
what Keen's planning.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.862
Okay, Ruddiger,
what do ya got?

07:52.036 --> 07:54.474
This bores through rock

07:54.648 --> 07:57.389
using ultrasonic
vibrations.

08:03.613 --> 08:05.746
Ha ha!
Hell of a lot quieter, too.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.617
It's not very deep.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.576
Don't we need to get through
two feet of concrete?

08:09.750 --> 08:12.579
Only needs to be deep enough
for the SCDA to do its thing

08:12.753 --> 08:16.147
and to keep me
out of the boss's heavy bag.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.149
Of course, what you gain
in noise reduction,

08:18.323 --> 08:20.369
you lose
in predictability.

08:20.543 --> 08:23.894
It takes time
to heat up and expand,

08:24.068 --> 08:26.288
for the pressure to build,
until finally...

08:29.204 --> 08:30.597
Boom.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.385
Talk to me
about access.

08:36.559 --> 08:39.954
Once we're in,
we need a way to smuggle
the cipher device out.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.913
The lab's mocking up
a fake to leave in
its place as we speak.

08:43.087 --> 08:44.872
We'll need to loop
the security feeds
to make the swap.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.439
Okay, but how do we gain entry
into their security passage?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.224
Silva Terzian.

08:49.398 --> 08:51.487
Immigrated from Armenia.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.750
Gets a tea
at the same cafe

08:53.924 --> 08:54.838
every morning
before she goes to work.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.057
She's our in.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.321
Ho-ho!

09:01.018 --> 09:03.064
Pack it up.
It's time to go.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.066
Wait. Like, now?
Why so soon?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.633
The breach
happens Friday night.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.417
That's when the museum
is hosting its fundraiser.

09:08.591 --> 09:10.854
Staff won't like
the FBI presence,

09:11.028 --> 09:12.726
won't want to cause a scene
in front of the donors,

09:12.900 --> 09:15.032
which means
they're more likely
to fall for our diversion.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.209
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

09:20.690 --> 09:21.865
Oh!

09:22.039 --> 09:23.867
I am so sorry!

09:24.041 --> 09:25.086
-No, it's okay.
-Let me help you with that.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.391
Don't...
Don't worry about it.

09:29.699 --> 09:32.136
Oh, hey!
You forgot your wallet.

09:32.310 --> 09:33.224
Thank you.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.880
Anyone unclear?
Any questions?

09:37.054 --> 09:39.274
I think the big question is,
what's Liz really up to?

09:39.448 --> 09:40.710
If we're successful
in bringing

09:40.884 --> 09:42.451
this device home
from Minsk,

09:42.625 --> 09:44.409
we have a good shot
at finding out.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.186
Let me know
if we have a problem.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.716
At the terminus, go left.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.326
Then straight ahead
200 feet.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.154
<i>Once you're on site,</i>

10:33.328 --> 10:35.025
you need to be
12 feet, 2 inches

10:35.199 --> 10:36.331
off the center
of the north wall.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.728
Your credentials
appear to be in order,

10:41.902 --> 10:43.860
but I'm afraid you're
in the wrong country.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.906
I go
wherever he takes me.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.169
Notorious fugitive
Raymond Reddington.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.910
I'm told you accepted
a stolen painting from him.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.955
He called himself
Lloyd Wilke.

10:52.129 --> 10:54.001
I could alert INTERPOL.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.611
I'm sure they'd love
to swarm your museum

10:55.785 --> 10:58.570
and arrest you
as an accomplice
after the fact.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.269
But that might kill the mood
of this lovely evening.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.184
Yes. That would be terrible.

11:03.358 --> 11:05.142
Or you could
have your people
show my team

11:05.316 --> 11:07.710
your security feeds
while I look at that Cezanne.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.167
Four minutes.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.126
All right.
You get started.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.910
I got the sensors.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.875
Beautiful city,
by the way.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.833
It's true what they say.
Minsk isn't just concrete.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.315
There is some really
beautiful concrete.

11:47.489 --> 11:51.014
Hey, Aram. It's Cooper.
Something about
a legal attache.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.799
We'll catch up
-in a second.
-All right.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.120
Not trying to cowboy
anyone, guys.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.035
Just want to take
a quick peek at the footage.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.345
Sensors are down.

13:08.439 --> 13:09.832
-They're here.
-Who's here?

13:10.006 --> 13:11.007
<i>The Task Force.</i>

13:11.181 --> 13:12.356
What the hell
are they doing here?

13:12.530 --> 13:14.054
What do you think?

13:14.228 --> 13:15.620
<i>Reddington must have sent them</i>

13:15.795 --> 13:17.361
<i>to get the device
before we can.</i>

13:17.535 --> 13:19.363
We have to hurry.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.201
Hey, Aram,
we're in place.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.681
<i>Okay,
just give me a minute
to record enough footage</i>

13:32.855 --> 13:33.856
<i>to loop the feeds.</i>

13:56.748 --> 13:58.054
Okay. The cameras
are bypassed.

13:58.228 --> 13:59.055
You're good to go.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.975
-Hurry, hurry.
-Okay. Any minute now.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.585
Don't answer that.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.500
It's about to blow.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.067
What...

14:11.241 --> 14:12.416
Hello?

14:12.590 --> 14:14.244
I just had a dream
about you.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.898
<i>I'm sorry, Neville.
Now's not a good time.</i>

14:16.072 --> 14:17.987
No, don't interrupt
or I'll forget.

14:18.161 --> 14:21.338
<i>I was at a wedding,
about to greet
the bride and groom,</i>

14:21.512 --> 14:23.210
<i>but everyone was crying.</i>

14:23.384 --> 14:25.038
And suddenly I realized,
this isn't a wedding.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.474
It's a funeral.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.261
Aram, we're ready
to open the case.

14:31.435 --> 14:32.349
Are the sensors down?

14:32.523 --> 14:33.873
Uh, guys?
This is weird,

14:34.047 --> 14:35.135
but the sensors
are already off.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.405
I hate funerals.

14:44.579 --> 14:47.103
<i>I'm absolutely squeamish
about open caskets.</i>

14:47.277 --> 14:48.670
<i>I was terrified.</i>

14:48.844 --> 14:51.194
<i>And that's when
I felt someone
squeeze my hand.</i>

14:51.368 --> 14:53.414
And it was you.
You were holding my hand.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.024
<i>And I wasn't afraid anymore.</i>

14:55.198 --> 14:56.852
<i>Oh, and guess
who was in the casket.</i>

14:57.026 --> 14:58.985
I don't know.
-Reddington.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.422
And he looked hideous,
all sunken and yellow.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.206
I'm sorry, Neville.
I really have to...

15:03.380 --> 15:06.906
<i>I know I was harsh before,
but this dream is a good sign.</i>

15:07.080 --> 15:10.300
I am rooting for you,
Elizabeth.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.737
I gotta go.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.738
He said he had
a dream about me.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.697
He is creepy.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.009
What the hell's
going on?

15:43.638 --> 15:44.508
Run.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.212
-Ahh!
-What are you doing?

15:52.386 --> 15:54.040
The badge. I left it
in the furnace room.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.433
-Forget the badge!
-We can't get through the
security gate without it.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.000
-We'll go on foot!
-I'll be back.

15:58.174 --> 15:58.783
I'll meet you in the van.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.004
Ugh.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.701
It's her.
She's in the building.
Keen's got the cipher!

16:03.875 --> 16:05.355
Aram,
tell me you have eyes.

16:05.529 --> 16:07.792
Got her. Basement,
near the east stairwell.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.098
Agent Park is
right around the corner.

16:12.188 --> 16:12.841
Oh, no.

16:25.941 --> 16:28.074
It really is
a lovely piece.

16:40.651 --> 16:41.478
Ahh!

16:54.230 --> 16:56.145
I always wanted
a hero moment.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.668
I got the badge.

17:00.628 --> 17:03.283
Let's go!
Grab the Knot!

17:03.457 --> 17:04.545
Yeah, I got it.
I'm right behind you.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.201
Where's Park?

17:09.941 --> 17:11.900
What, are you gonna shoot me?

17:12.074 --> 17:14.207
-For this?
-You don't understand.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.470
I'm dead
without the device
that's in that bag.

17:16.644 --> 17:19.299
Shoot me, then. Show me
there's nothing left of
the old Elizabeth Keen.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.909
The cipher.
I have to have it.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.911
Why?

17:23.085 --> 17:25.131
You mean for Townsend
so we can't read
his messages?

17:26.306 --> 17:26.958
Townsend?

17:29.004 --> 17:30.919
He doesn't know I'm...

17:31.093 --> 17:33.313
Why would you say that?

17:33.487 --> 17:34.879
<i>Liz, where are you?</i>

17:35.054 --> 17:36.272
Liz, we need to go right now.

17:42.235 --> 17:43.105
Park!

17:43.279 --> 17:44.759
Hey.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.113
-Is she okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.941
Where's Liz?
Where'd she go?

18:05.127 --> 18:07.129
You're not taking
the painting?

18:07.303 --> 18:09.262
My concern is
finding Reddington.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.177
Agents from
our Art Theft unit
will be in touch,

18:11.351 --> 18:12.308
and they'll want to
discuss the details.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.875
Excuse me.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.400
We got a problem.

18:17.574 --> 18:18.836
What kind of problem?

18:19.010 --> 18:20.142
A Liz Keen problem.

18:23.450 --> 18:28.411
My pumpkin
cheesecake thumbprints
are sort of legendary.

18:28.585 --> 18:29.760
They were
Glen's favorite.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.197
Thank you, Paula.

18:32.763 --> 18:33.982
Yes. Thank you, Paula.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.027
You're welcome,
Steve, Bill.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.684
Paula, is there anything
you'd like to tell us?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.992
I used canned pumpkin.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.254
Ahh.

18:47.343 --> 18:48.997
You know who I am.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.390
I do.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.609
I am so sorry.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.090
I know
it's a big secret.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.700
How did you find out,
Paula?

18:58.398 --> 19:03.142
I found this
under Jelly's bed.

19:03.316 --> 19:06.014
I say "manuscript,"

19:06.188 --> 19:08.843
but it's really
more of a memoir.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.758
Glen was writing a book?

19:10.932 --> 19:12.673
About your time
together,

19:12.847 --> 19:16.372
the hijinks
and shenanigans.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.157
Oh, don't worry.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.463
I don't think he sent it
to any publishers yet.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.204
I can't believe this.

19:22.378 --> 19:23.771
I can.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.425
Me too!

19:25.599 --> 19:27.383
It makes
a whole lot more sense

19:27.557 --> 19:31.735
than Jelly being
Huey Lewis' muse.

19:31.909 --> 19:34.912
Paula, why are you
telling me all of this now?

19:35.086 --> 19:36.740
That's the thing.

19:36.914 --> 19:40.483
I've been
retired from Ma Bell
for some time now,

19:40.657 --> 19:42.572
and I've been keeping
to my budget,

19:42.746 --> 19:47.751
but after Jelly died,
without his income,

19:47.925 --> 19:53.540
um, things have gotten
sort of...tight.

19:53.714 --> 19:57.021
Now, I-I'm not asking
for a handout.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.808
I went back to work
at the phone company
part-time,

20:00.982 --> 20:04.725
but if you could
maybe lend me...

20:04.899 --> 20:05.682
How much do you need?

20:05.856 --> 20:08.772
$172.

20:08.946 --> 20:12.907
And I'll pay it back
with interest.

20:13.081 --> 20:14.996
Or I could work it off,

20:15.170 --> 20:17.999
pressing that suit

20:18.173 --> 20:22.612
or maybe cooking you two
a nice cream can dinner.

20:22.786 --> 20:26.181
Well, that does sound nice,
but, Paula, this is a gift.

20:26.355 --> 20:29.924
One I offer you
in exchange for your
continued discretion.

20:30.098 --> 20:31.882
No gifts.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.798
I have to insist
on paying you back.

20:34.972 --> 20:38.933
Then let's just say
I'm purchasing
Glen's manuscript.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.070
Well, that would mean
a lot to him.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.464
You say you've
gone back to work
at the phone company?

20:48.638 --> 20:51.337
Yeah, the cellular one,
the big one.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.556
Eighteen hours
a week now.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.123
Why do you ask?

21:00.650 --> 21:02.522
What on earth?

21:02.696 --> 21:04.959
Reddington must have
donated the painting
so he could case the museum.

21:05.133 --> 21:06.308
What do you think
he was after?

21:06.482 --> 21:07.396
The Russian Knot.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.747
That machine
is one-of-a-kind.

21:10.921 --> 21:11.748
Lucky we stopped him.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.403
Yes. Thank God
for the FBI.

21:14.577 --> 21:16.666
Your local police are gonna
want to secure the area.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.146
We should clear
everyone out.

21:27.938 --> 21:29.113
Tell me
that was the fake.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.290
Hmm.

21:31.464 --> 21:32.291
Thank God for the FBI.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.302
We got the device,
and the Art Theft unit
got the Cezanne.

21:43.476 --> 21:44.694
<i>Excellent.</i>

21:44.868 --> 21:46.653
Please tell me
you made it to the opera.

21:46.827 --> 21:48.350
<i>We didn't.
Keen made sure of that.</i>

21:48.524 --> 21:50.352
Oh, of course.
She was there.

21:50.526 --> 21:51.745
That's what I can't square,

21:51.919 --> 21:53.399
is the "of course"
of it all.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.226
You told me
that she and Townsend

21:55.401 --> 21:57.011
were using
one of these devices

21:57.185 --> 21:58.839
<i>to encrypt
their communiques,</i>

21:59.013 --> 22:00.841
that you'd intercepted
those communiques,

22:01.015 --> 22:03.147
but couldn't decrypt them
unless we went to Minsk

22:03.322 --> 22:04.932
and got
the other device.

22:05.106 --> 22:07.891
Something Elizabeth
would never have
wanted you to do.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.067
What I can't square
is how she knew
we were doing it.

22:10.241 --> 22:12.200
Or why, when I mentioned
Townsend's name,

22:12.374 --> 22:14.594
Keen acted like
he had no idea
she was there.

22:14.768 --> 22:16.596
Well, I can't speak
to any of that,

22:16.770 --> 22:18.728
but all that matters
is that you have the device

22:18.902 --> 22:21.209
and I have the ability
to show you how to use it

22:21.383 --> 22:23.211
to read the text
on that billboard,

22:23.385 --> 22:24.908
which I'll do
as soon as I finish

22:25.082 --> 22:27.215
with a pressing
appointment.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.609
More pressing than
stopping Townsend
and finding Elizabeth?

22:29.783 --> 22:32.089
For the moment.

22:32.263 --> 22:34.222
Paula, tell me
something good.

22:34.396 --> 22:38.226
Well, you know
Ernie in billing
has had his eye on me

22:38.400 --> 22:40.010
since his missus passed,

22:40.184 --> 22:44.885
so I took him up on an offer
to have dinner at Perkins.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.191
I sort of
sweet-talked him.

22:47.366 --> 22:51.848
Anyway, I told him I did
one of those spit tests,

22:52.022 --> 22:54.242
found out
I had a half-sister,

22:54.416 --> 22:58.289
and was just desperate
to get an address.

23:03.773 --> 23:05.427
Emma Foster.

23:05.601 --> 23:08.256
Date of birth, address,
phone number.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.737
And he just went
and got it for you?

23:10.911 --> 23:15.481
I always told Jelly
you get more bees
with honey.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.570
You are the bee's knees,
Paula.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.182
Oh, and what's this?

23:21.356 --> 23:24.315
A receipt from Perkins.

23:24.490 --> 23:28.189
If it's not too much,
I'd like to get reimbursed
for the chicken dinner.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.670
Ernie wanted
to go Dutch.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.454
Ugh. Ernie.

23:39.374 --> 23:40.462
Ressler.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.159
Reddington's
lying to you.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.247
You want to
tell me about it?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.640
How about you
turn yourself in?

23:44.814 --> 23:47.643
He told you I wanted
the device to keep him

23:47.817 --> 23:49.819
from reading messages
between me and Townsend.

23:49.993 --> 23:52.518
Yeah, a theory you proved
by trying to prevent us
from getting it.

23:52.692 --> 23:55.172
I wasn't there to keep you
from reading my messages.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.523
I was there to get it
so that I could read his.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.655
Wait.
The billboard's his?

23:59.829 --> 24:02.353
Billboard?
I don't know anything
about a billboard.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.313
What I know is Reddington uses
the Knot to decrypt messages

24:05.487 --> 24:08.055
in classified ads
in <i>The Washington Post.</i>

24:08.229 --> 24:09.926
If he's decrypting messages
using a Russian Knot,

24:10.100 --> 24:12.755
then why send us to Minsk
to get another one?

24:12.929 --> 24:15.236
So that I couldn't read
what he and his handler
are saying to each other.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.630
That's who
he's talking to.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.501
If I can prove he's talking
to the Russians...

24:19.675 --> 24:20.720
You can prove he's N-13.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.678
I am not the enemy.

24:22.852 --> 24:24.463
He is.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.551
Please.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.335
Let me prove it to you.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.773
Keen wants to meet.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.646
What she wants
is to destroy the device

24:33.820 --> 24:35.561
so we can't know
what she and Townsend
are planning.

24:35.735 --> 24:38.085
No, I think she wants
to use the device

24:38.259 --> 24:40.609
to prove that Reddington's
communicating with
his Russian handler.

24:40.783 --> 24:42.132
I feel like we should
at least hear her out.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.917
You think we should
give her a big hug.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.876
She probably needs one.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.226
Look, the Russian Knot
is a relic of the Cold War

24:49.400 --> 24:51.402
that creates
an analog code.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.840
Newspaper classifieds
barely exist anymore.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.885
This sounds a lot more
like Mr. Reddington

24:56.059 --> 24:57.234
than it does Agent Keen

24:57.408 --> 24:58.888
or Neville Townsend.

24:59.062 --> 25:01.500
I appreciate
your reluctance,
Agent Park,

25:01.674 --> 25:03.458
but if there's a chance
this could finally prove

25:03.632 --> 25:05.678
that Reddington's
a Russian agent,

25:05.852 --> 25:07.854
I think we need to hear
what Agent Keen has to say.

25:08.028 --> 25:09.899
She's gonna want to know
that I have your word on this,

25:10.073 --> 25:11.771
that we're not gonna
double-cross her.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.642
You have it.
Now call her back.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.175
Cooper signed off.
Tell me how
this is gonna work.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.395
Grab a pen.
And listen carefully.

25:31.704 --> 25:33.314
This is Assistant Director
Harold Cooper,

25:33.488 --> 25:36.317
authorization code 39587.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.014
I need to requisition a team

25:38.188 --> 25:39.407
for surveillance
and apprehension.

25:49.765 --> 25:50.418
Who is it?

25:52.202 --> 25:52.855
Emma Foster?

25:54.030 --> 25:55.510
Who's asking?

25:55.684 --> 25:57.425
My name is Farwell Smith.

25:58.818 --> 26:00.341
Your mother's attorney.

26:03.953 --> 26:05.955
You worked
with my mom?

26:06.129 --> 26:09.437
I helped her with
some of her estate planning.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.918
She never mentioned you.

26:12.092 --> 26:15.399
Most of my clients
don't mention me
to their children.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.141
Wills and trusts
can be awkward.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.710
It's all part
of the job,

26:21.884 --> 26:24.321
in order to deliver
a little bit of good news

26:24.495 --> 26:26.585
at an otherwise
mournful time.

26:29.065 --> 26:30.153
M-Mournful?

26:33.330 --> 26:35.245
I'm... I'm sorry.
I thought you knew.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.643
Anne passed away.

26:55.004 --> 26:56.789
I am so sorry
for your loss.

27:12.108 --> 27:13.501
Hey, Keen. I'm here.

27:13.675 --> 27:15.546
<i>There's a man
selling pretzels</i>

27:15.721 --> 27:17.374
<i>at the 72nd street crossover
above the fountain.</i>

27:17.548 --> 27:18.811
<i>Buy one.</i>

27:18.985 --> 27:20.247
He's headed
into the park.

27:20.421 --> 27:21.422
Keen knows our vehicles
will have to pull back.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.380
Beta team, stand down.

27:23.554 --> 27:24.643
Delta, can you go on foot?

27:31.562 --> 27:33.260
Drop your cell
in the trash.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.181
Down the steps,
by the fountain.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.186
I don't have a visual.
Somebody get me eyes.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.666
Beta,
clear emergency access.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.636
So you have
bodyguards now.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.204
Is that it?

28:04.378 --> 28:05.727
You have
Reddington's ad?

28:07.642 --> 28:10.036
Did Reddington
tell you how he knew
I'd be in Minsk?

28:11.733 --> 28:13.779
I think he thinks
I told you.

28:13.953 --> 28:15.258
Guess that's
the romantic in him.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.437
Okay.
Enter the number first.

28:20.611 --> 28:21.743
That belong
to your mother?

28:25.007 --> 28:27.357
Please tell me that you
at least tried calling that.

28:27.531 --> 28:28.837
It's not
a phone number.

28:29.011 --> 28:31.013
It's a key meant to orient
the machine's settings.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.537
And, yes, this book
belonged to my mother,

28:33.712 --> 28:36.279
along with a storage locker
filled with half-solved clues

28:36.453 --> 28:38.934
about Reddington and a series
of encrypted messages.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.544
There's more than one?

28:41.937 --> 28:43.286
And if we can
decrypt this one,

28:43.460 --> 28:45.245
we can decrypt
all of them.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.595
Okay. Now what?

28:47.769 --> 28:50.293
The circled letters,
in order.

28:53.079 --> 28:54.515
<i>I have eyes.
Should we move in?</i>

28:54.689 --> 28:56.125
Yes, but keep your distance
until units are in place.

28:56.299 --> 28:57.431
We don't know what kind
of protection she has,

28:57.605 --> 28:58.649
and I want
to keep this clean.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.130
C. M. A.

29:02.175 --> 29:02.871
That's it.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.227
You okay?
Keen, what is it?

29:11.401 --> 29:13.752
I don't know how Reddington
knew I was coming.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.318
I don't know how he knows
half the things he does.

29:17.233 --> 29:20.149
But I do know that
I'm right about this.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.760
I just wish
you'd believe me.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.152
I do believe you.

29:25.024 --> 29:26.416
I wish you didn't
need proof.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.427
That's the message?

29:38.428 --> 29:40.039
Numbers?

29:40.213 --> 29:41.344
I don't understand.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.695
Maybe we did it wrong.

29:44.870 --> 29:45.871
I mean, maybe
we need to try again.

29:50.571 --> 29:51.833
Damn it. Keen, hey!

29:52.007 --> 29:53.835
This isn't me!

29:54.009 --> 29:55.663
-Hey!
-Send them in. Now.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.100
We're made. Go.
Now! Move in.

29:58.274 --> 30:00.059
Keen, wait!
They lied to me!

30:04.541 --> 30:07.283
Keen. Hey. Stop.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.329
Stop. Keen,
they lied to me.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.896
I had no idea.
I swear.

30:14.203 --> 30:14.856
Oh, my God.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.697
She's somewhere
under the terrace.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.308
All units, move in.
I repeat, move in now.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.417
This can't be right.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.858
Your mother had
a considerable estate.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.338
We talked about it
as recently as a year ago.

31:02.512 --> 31:06.952
I was gonna get like $3,000,
not $3 million.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.955
Perhaps she wanted it
to be a pleasant surprise.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.263
Did you know she was in love
with a wanted fugitive?

31:16.744 --> 31:17.963
She told you that?

31:18.137 --> 31:19.616
She called last week,

31:19.790 --> 31:22.184
about him and how
these people

31:22.358 --> 31:24.926
had come to where
she lived to kill him.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.537
I tried asking her
what was going on,

31:27.711 --> 31:29.888
but all she wanted was
for me to protect myself,

31:30.062 --> 31:31.802
that the people
who were after him

31:31.977 --> 31:33.456
might come
after her or me.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.938
I thought
it was crazy talk.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.071
But she insisted
I drop everything and...

31:41.290 --> 31:42.552
Go into hiding.

31:44.076 --> 31:47.862
So I came here
and waited.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.473
She told me she was hoping
to stay with a friend
in a cabin on a lake,

31:52.693 --> 31:53.999
and she'd call me
when everything
settled down.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.741
That was the last time
I ever spoke to her.

32:02.616 --> 32:03.530
I don't know what to say.

32:06.707 --> 32:07.795
Did you know her well?

32:08.927 --> 32:11.930
I did.

32:12.104 --> 32:16.064
Then you can understand
why I want to remember
her love and kindness,

32:16.238 --> 32:18.675
not her connection
to a criminal.

32:18.849 --> 32:20.721
I can't do that
if any of this money
comes from him.

32:22.331 --> 32:24.159
Can you promise me
that it doesn't?

32:26.161 --> 32:27.510
I can't promise you that.

32:31.036 --> 32:34.735
But I can promise you
that your mother

32:34.909 --> 32:37.216
wanted you
to have everything

32:37.390 --> 32:38.521
that she could possibly
give you.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.916
That would include this.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.833
Think about it.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.488
You could always
donate it to charity,

32:48.662 --> 32:50.011
set up a scholarship.

32:51.447 --> 32:52.405
Put on a play.

32:53.797 --> 32:55.843
At the very least,

32:56.017 --> 32:57.062
pay all your bills,

32:57.236 --> 32:58.759
buy something for yourself,

32:58.933 --> 33:01.066
and then, if you want,

33:01.240 --> 33:02.850
you can give
the rest of it away.

33:05.940 --> 33:06.767
Just think about it.

33:14.775 --> 33:15.645
How did she die?

33:20.476 --> 33:21.564
It was an accident.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.741
Caused by the fugitive?

33:24.915 --> 33:25.612
No.

33:30.269 --> 33:32.575
But he...
He was responsible.

33:36.492 --> 33:38.973
Tell me,
a man like that...

33:40.714 --> 33:42.629
Do you think he'll ever get
what's coming to him?

33:48.722 --> 33:49.592
I do.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.386
You're crazy.
You do know that.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.344
I like to think of it
as determined.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.564
Yeah, determined
to get yourself killed.
And for what?

34:04.738 --> 34:06.783
We couldn't
crack the code.

34:06.957 --> 34:09.047
You had the messages
and the machine
to decrypt it,

34:09.221 --> 34:10.135
and what did you get?

34:10.309 --> 34:12.137
A whole lot of nothing.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.139
I must be missing a step,

34:14.313 --> 34:16.141
an input my mom
didn't know about.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.447
Say there is,
and we figured it out.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.797
You think the FBI's
letting you near
that machine again?

34:20.971 --> 34:23.974
Ressler gave you a shot.
He's not giving you
another one.

34:26.325 --> 34:27.848
How did Reddington know
we'd be in Minsk?

34:28.022 --> 34:30.416
We didn't tell anybody.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.201
We found the folder
of classified ads.

34:33.375 --> 34:36.770
We reviewed my mom's notes
on encryption.

34:36.944 --> 34:38.946
We were told we needed
the Russian Knot
to decrypt it,

34:39.120 --> 34:41.253
and we went to Minsk
to try and get it,

34:41.427 --> 34:43.559
but where's the opening
for Reddington in that?

34:45.561 --> 34:46.649
-Belsky.
-Belsky.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.522
We trusted you.

34:49.696 --> 34:53.003
And I value that trust,
but I value my life more.

34:53.178 --> 34:54.309
Which is why you
told Reddington.

34:54.483 --> 34:57.007
I was told to report
any inquiry about a code

34:57.182 --> 34:59.662
that requires
the Russian Knot
to decrypt.

34:59.836 --> 35:02.187
He was quite clear on how
important that was to him,

35:02.361 --> 35:04.189
and I know
what that means.

35:04.363 --> 35:07.714
So the minute we showed you
the ads, you showed him.

35:07.888 --> 35:11.152
She heard I was an expert
on the Russian Knot.

35:11.326 --> 35:13.372
She knew the ads
were a code

35:13.546 --> 35:16.201
and was hoping
I could decrypt them.

35:16.375 --> 35:20.379
"Mid-30s.
Brown hair. Blue eyes."

35:20.553 --> 35:21.902
Well, I didn't tell him
it was you,

35:22.076 --> 35:23.730
but he seemed to
know that already.

35:23.904 --> 35:27.342
You told me I needed
a Russian Knot
to decrypt the message.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.649
Well, I got one,
and I still can't read it!

35:29.823 --> 35:32.086
There are keys.
You need them
to read the code.

35:32.260 --> 35:33.522
I had them.
The phone number.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.481
Well,
maybe there are more,

35:35.655 --> 35:36.873
or the ones you had
were wrong.

35:37.047 --> 35:38.440
Well, give me
the right ones, then!

35:38.614 --> 35:40.181
I don't know them!

35:40.355 --> 35:42.618
Well, then find me
a person who does!

35:42.792 --> 35:44.751
The only person
who has the keys

35:44.925 --> 35:47.232
is the one who encrypted
the message.

35:47.406 --> 35:49.190
Reddington.

35:49.364 --> 35:50.539
Great.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.674
Is there anything
on Elizabeth?

35:54.848 --> 35:56.154
Not a word.

35:56.328 --> 35:58.678
Dembe has the faith
that comes from belief.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.897
All I have
are questions.

36:01.071 --> 36:03.944
Why, how, what for,
was it worth it?

36:04.118 --> 36:06.294
The answer's no.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.601
Whatever the outcome,
it most certainly was not.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.647
Well, at least
you have it.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.780
I do. Along with the hope
that I'm not being played.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.743
All right.
First, type in
the telephone number.

36:22.745 --> 36:25.661
I assume the Cezanne has been
returned to its rightful place

36:25.835 --> 36:28.011
at the Ashmolean Museum
in Oxford?

36:28.186 --> 36:28.838
It has.

36:30.579 --> 36:35.062
Now the first letter
of each word in order.

36:35.236 --> 36:39.501
I gave up the commission
on the sale
of a $20-million painting

36:39.675 --> 36:45.333
and enraged the consigliere
who entrusted me
with the task.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.902
Do you really think
I'd do all that just
to play you, Harold?

37:05.048 --> 37:06.572
A bunch of numbers?

37:06.746 --> 37:09.096
Yes, until
you substitute
each number

37:09.270 --> 37:11.316
for the corresponding letter
of the alphabet...

37:11.490 --> 37:14.406
1 becomes A,
2 becomes B,
and so forth.

37:14.580 --> 37:15.363
Do you have a pen?

37:17.278 --> 37:18.975
Ah, good.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.629
All right, let's hurry.

37:20.803 --> 37:21.935
I'm morbidly curious

37:22.109 --> 37:24.329
to find out what painful end

37:24.503 --> 37:27.854
Elizabeth has in store for me.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.464
The code
was the address for some
abandoned warehouse,

37:29.638 --> 37:31.292
a date, and a time.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.033
Instructions for a hit.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.339
But the device
was spitting out
random numbers.

37:34.513 --> 37:35.818
What... What were we missing?

37:35.992 --> 37:37.820
One more step.
Each number
in the sequence

37:37.994 --> 37:39.300
represents a corresponding
letter of the alphabet.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.259
So the billboard
was a message.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.086
Which means Reddington
told us the truth,

37:43.261 --> 37:44.436
and Keen didn't.

37:50.050 --> 37:52.748
I understand
why you're upset.
I wasn't honest with you.

37:52.922 --> 37:54.794
For what it's worth,
I wish I'd been wrong

37:54.968 --> 37:56.099
to doubt your judgment
about Keen.

37:56.970 --> 37:57.971
You were wrong.

37:58.145 --> 37:59.755
How can you say that?

37:59.929 --> 38:01.366
She said this was
about keeping her

38:01.540 --> 38:03.672
from Mr. Reddington's intel
when we now know

38:03.846 --> 38:05.500
it was about keeping him
from reading hers.

38:05.674 --> 38:07.023
Look. I know that's
what it looks like.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.808
It looks that way
because it is that way.

38:08.982 --> 38:10.592
You need to accept that.

38:10.766 --> 38:13.813
Why?
So you stop following me?

38:22.517 --> 38:23.518
Raymond!

38:23.692 --> 38:25.651
Hello, Paula!

38:25.825 --> 38:27.783
Thank you for coming.
How was the drive?

38:27.957 --> 38:29.524
Did Dembe
talk your ear off?

38:29.698 --> 38:32.135
It was just great.

38:32.310 --> 38:37.140
Sometimes I like
to lean my head
on the window next to me

38:37.315 --> 38:40.405
so I can feel all
the little bumps
on the road,

38:40.579 --> 38:43.408
and my vision
starts to flutter

38:43.582 --> 38:47.020
and I just space out,
like I'm in a dream.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.457
That sounds nice.

38:49.631 --> 38:51.590
You know
what also sounds nice?

38:51.764 --> 38:52.678
Employment.

38:53.809 --> 38:54.723
Did you get a new job?

38:54.897 --> 38:56.595
I did not.

38:56.769 --> 38:57.987
I'm offering one.

38:58.161 --> 39:00.120
What kind of job?

39:00.294 --> 39:02.296
A service provider.

39:02.470 --> 39:06.648
Are you asking me
to find people for you?

39:06.822 --> 39:08.346
Like Jelly Bean did?

39:08.520 --> 39:11.566
Why don't we sit,
have a cup of tea,

39:11.740 --> 39:14.874
share some tawdry tales,
have a laugh or two,

39:15.048 --> 39:17.093
and then
we'll drive you home.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.400
You can put your head
up against the glass

39:19.574 --> 39:21.968
and go
to your happy place,

39:22.142 --> 39:24.362
and I can tell you
what it is
I have in mind.

39:32.282 --> 39:33.762
-Ressler.
<i>Hey.</i>

39:33.936 --> 39:35.634
Thank God
you're all right, Keen.

39:35.808 --> 39:38.158
<i>I don't even know why
I'm returning this call.</i>

39:38.332 --> 39:40.508
Look. I'm sorry.
They used me to lure you out.

39:40.682 --> 39:41.857
Yeah, well,
a lot of good that did.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.381
You're right.

39:43.555 --> 39:46.035
But at least now I know what
those numbers mean.

39:46.209 --> 39:48.124
Because Cooper
handed the device
over to Reddington.

39:48.298 --> 39:49.648
He did.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.606
So they decoded
his fake message.

39:51.780 --> 39:53.042
<i>They think I'm a liar.</i>

39:53.216 --> 39:55.088
No, but I don't,
and I'll prove it.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.438
I know the step
that you're missing.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.397
Look. Each number
stands for a letter...

39:59.571 --> 40:01.224
<i>1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is C.</i>

40:01.399 --> 40:02.835
They're using
alphanumeric substitution.

40:03.009 --> 40:04.880
<i>Exactly. Hang on.</i>

40:05.054 --> 40:07.317
Okay. 17 is Q.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.320
16 is O. No.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.845
<i>16 is P.</i>

40:13.019 --> 40:16.239
18 is R. 1 is A. 14.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.415
N. <i>16?</i>

40:17.589 --> 40:19.068
P.2 is B.

40:21.201 --> 40:22.420
Wait a minute.
That doesn't make any sense.

40:22.594 --> 40:23.508
What does it say, Keen?

40:23.682 --> 40:26.772
QPRANPB.
It's not a word.

40:26.946 --> 40:29.252
<i>Maybe it's backwards
or the letters of each word
are jumbled.</i>

40:29.427 --> 40:30.906
I mean, Reddington told us
this is how it works.

40:31.080 --> 40:31.994
It has to say something.

40:34.867 --> 40:35.998
Oh, my God. That's it.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.915
The Cyrillic alphabet.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.787
<i>We translated the numbers
into English</i>

40:41.961 --> 40:43.571
because that's what
Reddington did,

40:43.745 --> 40:45.660
but his message was a fake
meant to throw us off.

41:23.263 --> 41:24.220
Oh, my God.

41:24.394 --> 41:25.787
Keen, what does it say?

41:25.961 --> 41:29.051
"It's time.
Mobilize assets."

41:29.225 --> 41:32.446
A message
from a Russian handler
to a Russian spy.

41:32.620 --> 41:33.882
Reddington.

41:34.056 --> 41:35.188
<i>But what
does he mean?</i>

41:35.362 --> 41:36.624
"It's time." Time for what?

41:45.328 --> 41:46.242
Rise and shine,
sleepyhead!

41:46.416 --> 41:48.288
Elizabeth.

41:48.462 --> 41:50.638
You wanted proof?
I got your proof.

41:50.812 --> 41:52.335
Proof that Reddington
is N-13.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.033
Proof that
he's responsible

41:54.207 --> 41:55.774
for what happened
to your family.

41:55.948 --> 41:57.993
And proof that
my mother was innocent.

41:59.734 --> 42:01.127
I can walk you
through the details

42:01.301 --> 42:02.737
after you catch
your breath

42:02.911 --> 42:05.348
and after you get it
through your thick skull

42:05.523 --> 42:07.655
that you do not
threaten me!

42:07.829 --> 42:10.049
Because while we may be
partners in this hunt,

42:10.223 --> 42:12.312
I do not work for you!
