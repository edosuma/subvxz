00:02.149 --> 00:06.085
The war between Ba'al and the system lords
has reached a critical stage.

00:06.153 --> 00:09.145
According to Tok'ra intelligence,
Bastet and Olokun are dead...

00:09.222 --> 00:12.055
Morrigan has capitulated
and Lord Yu and Amaterasu...

00:12.125 --> 00:15.458
are rallying their armies for what
will probably be their last stand.

00:15.529 --> 00:18.726
As we predicted, theJaffa were no match
for the Kull warriors.

00:18.799 --> 00:21.495
The Tok'ra also thought we should know,
in the face of imminent defeat...

00:21.568 --> 00:25.095
some of the system lords
are actively seeking out areas of refuge.

00:25.172 --> 00:30.166
Planets they abandoned long ago are now
being scouted as possible sanctuaries.

00:30.243 --> 00:33.406
- And this affects us how?
- One of these planets...

00:33.480 --> 00:36.074
which used to fall under the domain
of the System Lord Ares...

00:36.149 --> 00:38.379
also happens to be the place where
the Tok'ra dropped off...

00:38.452 --> 00:40.215
one Harry Maybourne two years ago.

00:40.954 --> 00:43.149
And this affects us how?

00:45.625 --> 00:48.822
The Tok'ra have their hands full
with more pressing matters.

00:48.895 --> 00:52.490
They strongly suggest we get to
Maybourne before the Goa'uld do.

00:53.667 --> 00:57.194
If we do not retrieve him,
Harry Maybourne faces certain capture.

00:59.072 --> 01:02.473
Torture, interrogation...

01:02.542 --> 01:04.237
perhaps even death.

01:07.314 --> 01:09.077
All right, fine. Go get him.

01:10.851 --> 01:12.341
Yes, sir.

01:29.102 --> 01:32.128
According to the Tok'ra, the people
of this world are fairly primitive.

01:32.205 --> 01:33.695
No phones, no lights, no motorcars.

01:33.774 --> 01:36.470
I bet you Maybourne just jumps
at a chance to leave.

01:37.444 --> 01:39.935
What of the other inhabitants?

01:40.013 --> 01:42.243
We'll relocate them.

01:42.315 --> 01:45.773
We may not have a lot of time.
Ares could be here in a matter of days.

01:57.931 --> 01:59.626
We don't mean you any harm.

02:02.135 --> 02:03.659
We are allies of the Tok'ra.

02:06.273 --> 02:09.731
Just looking for a friend of ours- Harry
Maybourne. Maybe you've heard of him?

02:09.810 --> 02:11.402
Shifty fella.

02:11.478 --> 02:13.002
Beady eyes.

02:13.079 --> 02:14.068
No?

02:14.147 --> 02:17.310
You will follow us to the village
and meet with King Arkhan.

02:17.384 --> 02:19.443
He will discern your true intentions.

03:01.027 --> 03:02.961
Not exactly the trusting type.

03:04.531 --> 03:07.500
Which leads me to wonder
whether Harry Maybourne is still alive.

03:07.567 --> 03:10.229
Presumably the Tok'ra put in
a good word for him.

03:10.303 --> 03:12.498
Maybe we should get them
to do the same for us.

03:32.993 --> 03:34.392
Maybourne.

03:36.096 --> 03:38.189
This is King Arkhan.

03:39.599 --> 03:43.330
My Lord, our hunting party encountered
these off-worlders by the gate.

03:44.070 --> 03:47.335
Hey, guys.
Long time no see.

04:56.042 --> 04:59.307
I should've known
you'd be the ones to come.

05:00.747 --> 05:02.271
You were expecting us?

05:03.083 --> 05:05.950
Sort of. Where's Jack?

05:06.019 --> 05:08.954
- General O'Neill is back at the SGC.
- No kidding.

05:09.689 --> 05:13.318
General O'Neill?
That doesn't sound right.

05:13.393 --> 05:16.260
Still, good forJack. Nice to hear
he's doing so well for himself.

05:16.329 --> 05:18.524
As, evidently, are you.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.497
This? Yes, well...

05:22.569 --> 05:24.298
it's a long story.

05:26.072 --> 05:27.437
Food!

05:28.608 --> 05:30.200
Drinks for our guests!

05:37.183 --> 05:38.775
We don't have time for this.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.286
You should try one of these.

05:43.356 --> 05:45.950
- It's called-
- Ojen fruit.

05:46.026 --> 05:49.553
Right. It's sort of a cross between
a guava and a mango.

05:49.629 --> 05:53.360
- Sort of a "guango"?
- I like that.

05:55.068 --> 06:00.199
People, henceforth, Ojen fruit
shall be called guango!

06:00.273 --> 06:01.763
So shall it be!

06:06.613 --> 06:08.308
I get to name all kinds of stuff.

06:08.381 --> 06:10.906
You should see
the Grateful Dead burial grounds.

06:10.984 --> 06:14.613
Maybourne, you have to get out of here.
You're in danger.

06:14.688 --> 06:17.987
I know.
The Goa'uld are coming.

06:18.058 --> 06:20.993
You should peel it before you eat it.

06:21.061 --> 06:24.462
- I find the skin kind of tart.
- You know about the Goa'uld?

06:24.531 --> 06:26.055
Oh, yeah.

06:30.537 --> 06:32.562
You were warned by the Tok'ra?

06:32.639 --> 06:36.006
I haven't heard from the Tok'ra
since they dropped me off.

06:36.076 --> 06:39.534
- Then how?
- I can read the future.

06:44.517 --> 06:45.711
Really.

06:46.586 --> 06:48.110
What are you trying to pull?

06:48.188 --> 06:49.678
He speaks the truth.

06:49.756 --> 06:51.553
King Arkhan is a prophet.

06:51.624 --> 06:54.957
He foresaw your arrival and the hand
you will play in defeating our enemy.

06:55.028 --> 06:58.691
Garan's right.
It's all part of the prophecy.

07:00.433 --> 07:02.901
Maybourne, what the hell is going on here?

07:09.476 --> 07:11.103
Let's go for a walk.

07:17.083 --> 07:20.416
Okay. Here we are.

07:21.287 --> 07:23.949
I found this place about 10 months ago...

07:24.023 --> 07:27.424
when I was out on an afternoon stroll.

07:28.495 --> 07:32.454
- It is quite a distance from the village.
- I enjoy long walks.

07:32.532 --> 07:37.265
Right. Long walks, rainy nights
and candlelit dinners.

07:37.337 --> 07:39.737
- Why are we here, Maybourne?
- This writing is in Ancient.

07:42.909 --> 07:44.809
What do the locals know about these ruins?

07:44.878 --> 07:46.402
Well, not much.

07:46.479 --> 07:49.937
They generally avoid the area because
it's close to the naquadah mines...

07:50.016 --> 07:52.143
the site of their former enslavement.

07:52.218 --> 07:54.743
- Bad luck and all.
- This is incredible.

07:55.855 --> 07:58.824
This is interesting.

07:58.892 --> 08:01.690
This is incredible.

08:08.501 --> 08:10.093
What is it?

08:10.170 --> 08:13.833
It's a record of the planet's history,
covering major events...

08:13.907 --> 08:16.899
only some of them
haven't happened yet.

08:16.976 --> 08:18.944
What are you talking about?

08:19.012 --> 08:21.776
They have a complicated lunar calendar.

08:21.848 --> 08:23.679
It took me a while to figure it out.

08:23.750 --> 08:28.119
But once I did, I realized
there were references in the text...

08:28.188 --> 08:30.122
to things that are gonna
happen in the future.

08:31.858 --> 08:34.486
Yeah, I know, it sounds crazy.

08:34.561 --> 08:37.655
I didn't think much of it either
at the time...

08:37.730 --> 08:40.631
but then this big
meteor shower happened...

08:40.700 --> 08:43.225
exactly on the date the stone predicted.

08:44.370 --> 08:46.361
Are you sure you're reading it correctly?

08:46.439 --> 08:50.535
My skills may not compare
with Dr. Jackson's...

08:50.610 --> 08:53.807
but over the years, I've picked up
a decent understanding of Ancient writing.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.576
As a result of my translations...

08:56.649 --> 09:00.585
I predicted a major flood
would destroy the village...

09:00.653 --> 09:03.747
unless I could convince the elders
to move to higher ground.

09:03.823 --> 09:07.418
And, of course, you told them
where these predictions came from.

09:07.493 --> 09:10.326
No. Well, not in so many words.

09:11.397 --> 09:13.695
Look. These are simple people.

09:13.766 --> 09:16.132
This stuff would mean nothing to them.

09:16.202 --> 09:18.864
I had to play the role of a prophet
to convince them.

09:18.938 --> 09:21.270
And out of gratitude, they made you king.

09:22.675 --> 09:24.973
Like I said, it was their idea.

09:30.350 --> 09:33.513
Well, he's partly right anyway.
It is a historical log.

09:33.586 --> 09:36.851
"In the first moon of the 45th cycle,
the ground will tremble...

09:36.923 --> 09:38.857
and devastation will be wrought."

09:38.925 --> 09:42.691
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Big earthquake,
couple years back. Before my time.

09:42.762 --> 09:44.354
Skip ahead.

09:44.430 --> 09:46.091
We're in the 54th cycle.

09:51.137 --> 09:53.571
"Commencing the third moon
of the 54th cycle"-

09:53.640 --> 09:56.074
Which is around now,
give or take a few days.

09:56.142 --> 09:59.111
- "The oppressors of old will return"-
- That's the Goa'uld.

09:59.178 --> 10:01.339
"To seek dominion over the land.

10:02.815 --> 10:06.376
- Those of a distant world will come"-
- I'm guessing that's you guys.

10:06.452 --> 10:09.615
"To vanquish the evil
and restore order once again."

10:09.689 --> 10:11.179
You see?

10:11.257 --> 10:15.421
They come. You defeat them.
Happy ending. That's the prophecy.

10:17.096 --> 10:19.621
Sorry, but we didn't come here
to fight the Goa'uld.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.057
We should get going.

10:23.136 --> 10:26.697
Actually, this is interesting.

10:26.773 --> 10:28.400
There's a lot here to translate.

10:43.790 --> 10:46.588
- <i>Sam?</i>
- Go ahead.

10:47.393 --> 10:49.623
- Maybourne was right.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

10:51.030 --> 10:53.794
Well, from what I've been able
to decipher, it's pretty clear.

10:54.634 --> 10:56.864
The script on these walls
is a historical log...

10:56.936 --> 10:59.029
compiled by an Ancient
who traveled through time...

10:59.105 --> 11:01.300
to study the evolution
of life on this world.

11:02.041 --> 11:05.374
Daniel, we know the Ancients
experimented with time travel...

11:05.445 --> 11:08.175
but we have no evidence
that they actually mastered it.

11:08.247 --> 11:10.044
<i>Yeah, well, we do now.</i>

11:10.116 --> 11:12.983
To the best of my knowledge,
these are only a couple hundred years old.

11:13.052 --> 11:16.215
<i>Which means they were carved</i>
<i>after the Goa'uld had already left.</i>

11:16.289 --> 11:18.450
But the Ancients predate the Goa'uld.

11:18.524 --> 11:20.219
Right. So the only logical explanation...

11:20.293 --> 11:24.457
is that an Ancient traveled to the future,
and then back to a time not too long ago.

11:25.398 --> 11:26.888
I don't know, Daniel.

11:26.966 --> 11:29.161
There are references
to the time travel device itself.

11:29.235 --> 11:31.100
It's described as being
inside a small ship.

11:31.170 --> 11:35.231
If I'm right, it may still be here.
I think it's worth a look.

11:37.276 --> 11:38.766
All right.
We're on our way.

11:57.530 --> 12:00.590
- <i>Daniel?</i>
- Go ahead.

12:01.467 --> 12:04.265
We've been at it a while.
Are you sure it's around here?

12:06.572 --> 12:08.563
Just give it a little more time.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.411
I hate to say it, Daniel,
but we can't risk staying much longer.

12:37.970 --> 12:40.029
I'm scrubbing the search.
Fall back to the gate.

12:41.541 --> 12:42.530
Sam?

12:42.608 --> 12:46.601
<i>Daniel, we have no way ofknowing</i>
<i>when the Goa'uld will get here.</i>

12:46.679 --> 12:49.580
- <i>It could be days.</i>
- <i>And it could be hours.</i>

12:52.318 --> 12:54.149
Colonel Carter, DanielJackson-

12:56.789 --> 12:58.416
I have found something.

13:45.605 --> 13:47.539
It certainly looks like a ship.

13:47.607 --> 13:49.336
These appear to be flight controls.

13:49.408 --> 13:50.898
So, what's this?

13:54.714 --> 13:56.375
It could be the time device.

14:00.186 --> 14:03.815
It bears little resemblance to Ancient
designs we have previously encountered.

14:03.890 --> 14:06.358
Judging from Maybourne's wall,
it must have worked at some point.

14:07.360 --> 14:10.022
I'm guessing it must manifest
some sort of energy field...

14:10.096 --> 14:12.690
that encompasses the entire ship...

14:12.765 --> 14:16.098
allowing the traveler
to literally fly through time.

14:16.169 --> 14:17.659
I wonder.

14:19.038 --> 14:23.771
Let's not touch anything just yet.
I'm kind of fond of this era.

14:23.843 --> 14:25.401
Okay, so what do we do?

14:26.879 --> 14:28.369
We bring it back.

14:29.348 --> 14:30.838
Judging by the dimensions...

14:30.917 --> 14:33.715
it looks like it was actually
designed to fit through the gate.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.910
Okay. How do we get it there?

14:35.988 --> 14:38.855
This vessel appears to be
relatively undamaged.

14:38.925 --> 14:40.950
The engine may yet be functional.

14:41.027 --> 14:43.621
This is Ancient technology.

14:45.665 --> 14:48.156
We'd need an Ancient to make it work.

14:48.234 --> 14:50.702
Or someone close.

15:12.191 --> 15:15.524
Jack, it's great to see you.

15:15.595 --> 15:17.085
How long has it been?

15:18.598 --> 15:23.763
Oh, since that time you got us stranded
off-world and tried to kill me.

15:24.470 --> 15:26.370
That takes me back.

15:26.439 --> 15:30.773
I guess congratulations are in order.
You made general.

15:30.843 --> 15:32.640
You made king.

15:32.712 --> 15:36.239
Right. Well, it's not a contest.

15:36.983 --> 15:39.918
Do you mind?
These guys are torturing that ditty.

15:39.986 --> 15:42.955
Right. Take five, guys.

15:43.022 --> 15:44.751
I taught 'em that expression.

15:46.459 --> 15:49.917
I'm hoping that you can
stay for a while...

15:49.996 --> 15:51.554
check out the sights...

15:53.599 --> 15:56.090
take in the culture.

15:56.168 --> 15:58.033
I want you to feel at home here.

15:58.104 --> 16:00.470
Harry, you're aware
of the fact that this place...

16:00.539 --> 16:03.770
is gonna be overrun
by a gaggle of bad guys soon?

16:03.843 --> 16:05.743
Yeah, well, maybe.

16:05.811 --> 16:07.608
Right.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.776
Carter told me about this prophecy stuff.
It's not gonna go down that way, you know.

16:11.851 --> 16:14.251
Come on, Jack.
You've defeated system lords before.

16:14.320 --> 16:17.619
No. You've got to tell these people
they gotta start packing.

16:17.690 --> 16:19.658
- We'll take as many as we can.
- I can't.

16:19.725 --> 16:21.852
I already told them you'd save the day.

16:23.796 --> 16:25.286
Let me ask you a question.

16:29.402 --> 16:32.701
Did this prophecy mention
anything about casualties...

16:32.772 --> 16:35.707
how many people would die
in the fighting?

16:36.976 --> 16:38.466
It's not really that detailed.

16:38.544 --> 16:42.776
Does it say anything
about the king surviving at all?

16:43.883 --> 16:45.373
Actually, there's...

16:47.486 --> 16:49.716
no reference to me specifically.

16:49.789 --> 16:53.088
- I just assumed.
- Do you really want to take that chance?

16:53.159 --> 16:54.854
Do you want to roll those dice?

17:00.566 --> 17:02.500
It's not gonna be easy
to convince 'em.

17:02.568 --> 17:06.197
You can do it, Harry.
You're the king.

17:07.940 --> 17:10.636
And remember, it's good to be king.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.412
- Nice ride.
- Yeah, Ancients like to fly in style.

17:30.162 --> 17:31.652
Nice.

17:42.641 --> 17:45.735
You're gonna have to help me
out here, Carter. Got any quarters?

17:45.811 --> 17:49.042
Unfortunately, I can't help you
with this one, sir. You're on your own.

17:49.115 --> 17:50.605
Fine.

17:53.352 --> 17:55.616
How do we know we're not
gonna end up back at the Alamo?

17:58.124 --> 17:59.751
For one thing, that was on Earth.

17:59.825 --> 18:02.225
But, more importantly...

18:02.294 --> 18:06.253
I've separated the time device
from the control circuits...

18:06.332 --> 18:07.822
I think.

18:09.702 --> 18:11.533
Concentrate on powering up the engines.

18:13.305 --> 18:15.034
Concentrate?

18:30.122 --> 18:31.612
Got nothin'.

18:32.892 --> 18:35.053
Come on. You've proven
the Ancient gene you possess...

18:35.127 --> 18:36.924
allows you to operate
Ancient technology.

18:36.996 --> 18:39.658
It's no different
than the device in Antarctica.

18:40.433 --> 18:44.893
Just focus your mind.

19:07.193 --> 19:08.683
Good.

19:08.761 --> 19:10.160
Good.

19:21.407 --> 19:22.897
Not so good.

19:33.786 --> 19:35.583
<i>Tempus fugit,</i> girls.

19:41.861 --> 19:44.193
I sure collected a lot of stuff
in only a couple of years.

19:44.263 --> 19:46.231
I guess I'm a bit of a pack rat.

19:46.298 --> 19:48.596
- When will you address your people?
- I'm getting to that.

19:48.667 --> 19:52.694
I'm thinking about
what I'm gonna say.

19:52.771 --> 19:54.739
Perhaps you should
consider telling the truth.

19:54.807 --> 19:56.502
That's one strategy.

19:56.575 --> 19:59.043
Whatever you decide,
we are running out of time.

19:59.111 --> 20:01.807
- We must leave soon.
- Yeah, I know.

20:01.881 --> 20:03.246
I know.

20:05.117 --> 20:07.551
No, no. Just leave that.
That stuff over there.

20:17.963 --> 20:20.454
The primary power source is depleted.

20:20.533 --> 20:22.899
We need to reroute the controls
to the secondary output...

20:22.968 --> 20:25.528
which was originally designed
to power the time device.

20:26.739 --> 20:28.434
Of course we do.

20:30.509 --> 20:32.841
Okay. Try it now, sir.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.404
Damn it.

21:17.356 --> 21:20.450
I'm just not that familiar
with Ancient technology.

21:20.526 --> 21:22.084
I need a little time.

21:22.161 --> 21:25.028
That is one thing
I can't give you, Carter.

21:25.097 --> 21:26.587
You can't be serious.

21:26.665 --> 21:29.259
Sir, this technology
is too valuable to lose.

21:29.335 --> 21:32.304
Carter, what do you want me to do,
call in reinforcements?

21:32.371 --> 21:35.101
It's not like we're throwing down
with a couple ofJaffa.

21:35.174 --> 21:38.701
We're taking on a system lord
and his band of merry bad guys.

21:40.746 --> 21:42.475
Inside and out.

21:42.548 --> 21:44.516
I want that thing gone.

21:53.626 --> 21:56.789
Surrender your weapons,
or die where you stand.

21:59.131 --> 22:01.361
Oh, if I had a nickel.

22:03.035 --> 22:04.434
Lower your weapons.

22:05.204 --> 22:08.332
I don't think so.

22:09.008 --> 22:12.034
We will not allow you
to take King Arkhan from us.

22:12.111 --> 22:15.512
Good King Arkhan is a fraud.

22:15.581 --> 22:18.641
Our king is wise.
He is a seer.

22:18.717 --> 22:21.811
He may be your king, but he's no seer.

22:21.887 --> 22:24.321
He can only interpret
what's been written on the pillars...

22:24.390 --> 22:26.187
of the temple ruins
not far from here.

22:26.258 --> 22:28.852
Those writings hold the prophecies,
and anyone who can read them...

22:28.927 --> 22:30.485
can make the same predictions.

22:30.562 --> 22:32.052
That is a lie!

22:33.732 --> 22:37.463
Why don't we just go back to the village
and let King Arkhan explain everything?

22:39.238 --> 22:40.728
First, lower your weapons.

22:49.682 --> 22:51.206
They're not gonna shoot...

22:52.384 --> 22:53.976
are ya?

23:09.568 --> 23:11.661
God, I miss going off-world.

23:13.238 --> 23:14.762
Oh, yeah.

23:25.684 --> 23:27.447
Who would've thunk?

23:27.519 --> 23:29.248
Oh, hey, Jack.

23:31.623 --> 23:36.185
I spoke with Garan. I'm sorry to hear
about what happened at the ship.

23:36.261 --> 23:38.661
- Believe me, I had nothing to do with it.
- I know, Harry.

23:38.731 --> 23:41.165
You're always the victim in these things.

23:42.367 --> 23:45.894
Okay, I'll admit
that when I first found the ruins...

23:47.773 --> 23:50.469
I did plan to use them
to my personal advantage.

23:50.542 --> 23:53.409
But all that changed
once I became King Arkhan the First.

23:53.479 --> 23:55.071
Oh, please.

23:55.147 --> 23:57.377
It's true, Jack.

23:57.449 --> 23:59.883
I care about these people.
I want to help them.

23:59.952 --> 24:01.920
Then tell 'em the truth.

24:01.987 --> 24:03.818
Come clean on all this stuff.

24:03.889 --> 24:08.053
I've already arranged
for an assembly with the village elders.

24:10.262 --> 24:11.957
I'm gonna tell 'em we have to leave.

24:36.655 --> 24:38.885
Well...

24:38.957 --> 24:40.447
here goes nothing.

24:51.770 --> 24:54.261
My friends...

24:54.339 --> 24:57.103
I wish I were here
under better circumstances...

24:57.176 --> 25:01.169
but the fact is I've come before you all
to deliver a warning.

25:03.015 --> 25:06.507
The village is in danger,
and the time has come for us to leave.

25:09.655 --> 25:12.146
We must abandon our world.

25:12.224 --> 25:15.284
Arrangements are being made to help us...

25:18.030 --> 25:20.965
temporarily relocate to a safe place.

25:22.034 --> 25:24.002
But the prophecy was clear.

25:25.137 --> 25:26.968
The enemy will be defeated.

25:27.706 --> 25:29.537
Yes, uh...

25:29.608 --> 25:32.543
the prophecy was clear,
but only up to a certain point.

25:32.611 --> 25:35.444
After that, it was somewhat unclear.

25:35.514 --> 25:40.008
Sort of a murky clarity.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.090
Of course, the enemy will be defeated...

25:50.262 --> 25:53.129
but there is a chance that some of us...

25:53.198 --> 25:56.634
may get hurt or even killed
in the process and I am not willing-

25:56.702 --> 26:00.399
Impossible!
You assured us we would be safe.

26:01.406 --> 26:02.896
Yes, l-

26:03.909 --> 26:05.399
I remember that.

26:05.477 --> 26:07.206
However-

26:27.332 --> 26:28.822
The truth is...

26:31.703 --> 26:34.297
I've not been
entirely honest with you.

26:36.842 --> 26:38.867
I am not a seer.

26:39.645 --> 26:43.240
I don't posses insight into the future...

26:43.315 --> 26:46.751
or divine powers that set me apart.

26:47.552 --> 26:50.988
I'm just a regular guy...

26:51.056 --> 26:53.957
no more or less special
than any of you.

26:55.527 --> 26:57.791
But the prophecies.

26:59.698 --> 27:01.996
The prophecies don't come from me.

27:03.435 --> 27:05.801
They come from
the walls of the old temple...

27:05.871 --> 27:08.362
written in stone for all to see.

27:09.608 --> 27:14.841
I have the ability
to interpret these writings...

27:14.913 --> 27:17.711
and with the proper understanding...

27:18.650 --> 27:20.242
any of you could do the same.

27:26.892 --> 27:29.793
I am a pretender.

27:30.662 --> 27:34.393
I took advantage of you...

27:36.735 --> 27:41.331
and for that I am deeply sorry.

27:42.341 --> 27:45.333
What about the design
for the new water mill?

27:45.410 --> 27:47.640
Was this written
on the temple wall as well?

27:47.713 --> 27:49.977
No, that was from me.

27:50.048 --> 27:52.039
And our new medicines?

27:52.117 --> 27:54.051
Our legal code?

27:54.119 --> 27:55.643
The irrigation system?

27:55.721 --> 27:58.019
Were these things
also found in the ruins?

27:58.090 --> 27:59.614
No.

28:00.726 --> 28:03.593
These were not the acts
of a pretender...

28:03.662 --> 28:05.152
but of a leader.

28:08.967 --> 28:12.403
Guys, I'm touched, really.

28:12.471 --> 28:15.338
What does it matter
where the prophecies come from?

28:15.407 --> 28:18.843
All we need know is that each one
of them has been fulfilled...

28:18.910 --> 28:20.468
as this latest will be fulfilled.

28:20.545 --> 28:23.673
Let's not get carried away here.

28:23.749 --> 28:25.740
We will defeat this enemy.

28:25.817 --> 28:29.014
And we will do so under
the leadership of our great king...

28:29.087 --> 28:31.021
Arkhan the First!

28:54.312 --> 28:56.075
Jack-

28:56.148 --> 28:58.673
- Look, sorry about that.
- Not my problem, Harry.

28:58.750 --> 29:01.776
If these folks don't want to go,
they don't have to go.

29:02.454 --> 29:05.480
Teal'c, you and Daniel head on back,
secure the gate.

29:05.557 --> 29:08.617
Carter, you and I
will take care of the ship.

29:08.693 --> 29:11.218
Jack, Jack. Wait a minute.

29:11.296 --> 29:13.457
I know it sounds crazy...

29:13.532 --> 29:16.057
but Garan was right
about the prophecies.

29:16.134 --> 29:18.102
They have all come true.

29:18.170 --> 29:21.333
Harry, we're not staying...

29:21.406 --> 29:25.706
and if you want to come with us, I suggest
you get your royal butt to the gate.

29:57.042 --> 29:58.839
<i>Jack, come in.</i>

29:58.910 --> 30:00.400
Go ahead.

30:00.479 --> 30:02.777
We got a little problem here.

30:05.484 --> 30:07.452
Ares'Jaffa just came through the gate.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.680
We're cut off.

30:09.754 --> 30:12.723
<i>If you blow the ship now,</i>
<i>you'll give away your position.</i>

30:13.892 --> 30:15.553
Guess we're staying for a while.

30:41.286 --> 30:42.913
Welcome, strangers.

30:42.988 --> 30:44.751
I am King Arkhan the First.

30:44.823 --> 30:47.291
It is with a joyful heart and open arms
that we welcome you-

30:47.359 --> 30:50.795
I am Trelak, first prime
to the great Lord Ares...

30:50.862 --> 30:55.595
your god who will be returning to reclaim
this land and his loyal followers.

30:55.667 --> 31:00.866
Of course. Of course.
Glad tidings of comfort and joy.

31:00.939 --> 31:02.907
Comfort and joy.

31:02.974 --> 31:05.067
Lord Ares demands nothing short...

31:05.143 --> 31:08.408
of complete obedience
from both you and your people.

31:09.447 --> 31:12.746
Any resistance will be dealt with harshly.

31:12.817 --> 31:14.307
Understood.

31:17.489 --> 31:19.184
Gather your subjects.

31:19.257 --> 31:20.849
Inform them of our arrival.

31:20.926 --> 31:23.156
Of course.
I'll address them immediately.

31:27.632 --> 31:29.566
Do you have something to say, slave?

31:29.634 --> 31:31.431
I am not a slave.

31:31.503 --> 31:33.266
I apologize.

31:33.338 --> 31:35.898
My servant spoke out of turn.
She will be punished.

31:36.641 --> 31:38.074
Of course she will.

31:46.585 --> 31:48.746
Kill me if you want,
but know this-

31:48.820 --> 31:51.220
in the end, you and your people
will be defeated...

31:51.289 --> 31:53.450
just as the prophecy has foretold.

31:53.525 --> 31:55.356
The prophecy?

31:56.995 --> 32:00.260
Pay no attention.
She is obviously frightened beyond reason.

32:00.332 --> 32:03.358
It foretold of your arrival
and of your defeat.

32:03.435 --> 32:06.233
Another predicted rain today
with a chance of morning frost...

32:06.304 --> 32:08.033
and yet what fine weather
we are enjoying.

32:08.106 --> 32:09.630
Silence!

32:12.544 --> 32:14.136
Where may I find this prophecy?

32:17.682 --> 32:19.809
If what you say is true...

32:19.884 --> 32:22.819
then we would be fools
to stay and meet our certain death.

32:26.057 --> 32:28.617
It is written on the walls
of the old temple.

32:30.295 --> 32:31.785
Go with her.

32:48.313 --> 32:50.338
<i>Sam, Jack, this is Daniel.</i>

32:50.415 --> 32:52.849
<i>Ares'first primejust sent</i>
<i>some men out to check the ruins.</i>

32:52.917 --> 32:56.717
<i>As soon as they see that Ancient writing,</i>
<i>they're gonna search the area.</i>

32:56.788 --> 32:58.779
<i>Carter, how's it going in there?</i>

32:58.857 --> 33:00.518
Just a few more minutes, sir.

33:01.326 --> 33:03.351
<i>What are you doing?</i>
<i>I thought you were gonna blow it up.</i>

33:03.428 --> 33:06.022
General O'Neill's given me one more
chance to get the engines on line...

33:06.097 --> 33:07.587
so we can fly it out of here.

33:07.666 --> 33:10.328
<i>I'm all for saving the ship,</i>
<i>but you're cutting it kind of close.</i>

33:10.402 --> 33:11.892
I know.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.365
Go, go, go.

33:21.246 --> 33:23.737
I have prepared a feast in your honor.

33:24.883 --> 33:26.043
Come.

33:28.253 --> 33:32.417
Please, sit.
Partake of our bounty.

33:33.892 --> 33:36.190
This fruit, for instance.

33:36.261 --> 33:38.252
It's sort of a cross between a-

33:38.330 --> 33:41.197
I'm not interested in your offerings.

33:41.266 --> 33:42.893
You were warned.

33:42.967 --> 33:45.868
Anyone who refuses to accept us will die.

33:47.405 --> 33:50.374
You've made yourself perfectly clear.

33:50.442 --> 33:52.637
To you, perhaps...

33:52.711 --> 33:56.340
but your subjects seem
less than willing to accept our terms.

33:56.414 --> 33:57.972
They cling to archaic beliefs...

33:58.049 --> 33:59.949
prophesies, portents...

34:00.018 --> 34:03.510
that threaten to undermine
the rule of our god.

34:06.091 --> 34:08.059
That won't happen.

34:10.628 --> 34:12.118
I can see to it.

34:14.599 --> 34:16.089
How?

34:16.968 --> 34:19.562
They're simple folk, easily influenced.

34:21.406 --> 34:24.773
With my help, you'll have no trouble
bending them to your will.

34:26.878 --> 34:28.368
It's here.

34:55.940 --> 34:56.929
Damn it.

34:57.809 --> 34:59.709
<i>Carter.</i>

34:59.778 --> 35:00.767
Sir?

35:01.579 --> 35:03.069
They're headed our way.

35:04.649 --> 35:06.207
I need more time.

35:08.186 --> 35:09.778
Of course you do.

35:34.546 --> 35:36.912
Those were Tauri weapons.

35:36.981 --> 35:38.471
What's a Tauri?

36:04.709 --> 36:06.199
Time's up.

36:20.625 --> 36:22.559
You're too late to save this world.

36:22.627 --> 36:24.822
I've already received word.

36:24.896 --> 36:27.956
Lord Ares has just arrived.

36:43.414 --> 36:45.507
I'm done! I think.

36:46.885 --> 36:48.375
You're good to go, sir.

36:49.687 --> 36:51.621
I'm doing the best I can.

36:53.057 --> 36:55.150
What were you and your allies planning?

37:03.635 --> 37:05.330
Know this <i>shol'va-</i>

37:06.771 --> 37:10.263
I'll see to it that you suffer slowly.

37:10.341 --> 37:14.368
And I will see to it that you die quickly.

37:38.636 --> 37:40.627
I think not.

37:40.705 --> 37:42.570
My men guard the gate...

37:42.640 --> 37:44.733
and the mother ship
descends as we speak.

38:24.616 --> 38:27.176
You were plotting in concert
with the people of this world.

38:27.952 --> 38:31.080
Treachery is something we cannot abide.

38:31.155 --> 38:33.089
I couldn't agree with you more.

38:33.157 --> 38:36.786
You think you feel outraged. Imagine
how I feel- betrayed by my own people!

38:55.980 --> 38:58.210
Sir, we're detecting another ship.

38:58.282 --> 39:00.045
It's big.

39:36.954 --> 39:38.581
<i>Shol'va.</i>

40:20.765 --> 40:22.426
You are a man of your word.

40:22.500 --> 40:23.762
Indeed.

40:38.416 --> 40:39.906
You're doing great, sir.

40:43.321 --> 40:45.016
Relatively speaking.

40:52.864 --> 40:54.456
Weapons.

40:55.399 --> 40:56.889
Weapons.

41:01.973 --> 41:03.941
Keep firing, sir.

41:05.042 --> 41:06.703
Nothing's happening.

41:06.778 --> 41:08.336
Weapons must be depleted.

41:08.412 --> 41:11.006
Hopefully, you hit some vital systems.

41:22.660 --> 41:24.150
Think that was vital?

41:25.763 --> 41:27.253
Relatively speaking.

41:44.849 --> 41:46.612
You sure you don't want
to leave all of this?

41:46.684 --> 41:49.676
I can't abandon these people, Jack.

41:49.754 --> 41:51.312
I made a life here.

41:51.389 --> 41:55.485
I can't walk away from my home,
my friends, my wives.

41:57.195 --> 41:58.685
Wives?

42:04.035 --> 42:05.024
Go.

42:14.078 --> 42:15.978
Wives.

42:18.583 --> 42:20.073
Dog.
