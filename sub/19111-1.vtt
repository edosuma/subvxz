Male newscaster

when I don't get my fritter.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.245
Dave

03:00.247 --> 03:02.481
And this machine...
Just like my ex.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.417
Jack
took my money and
didn't give me no pie.

03:05.419 --> 03:05.417
Huh.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.953
These things are gonna be
the death of me anyway.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.288
You want something?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.390

03:14.195 --> 03:16.461

03:16.463 --> 03:18.664
Well the bills have been
pilling up right. What can I do?

03:18.666 --> 03:20.532
Tell them go fuck

03:20.534 --> 03:22.401
That's what i
would have done.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.736
Man fuck this place.
This place sucks.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.941
Aren't you the
assistant manager?

03:28.943 --> 03:30.609
Oh yeah

03:31.544 --> 03:33.545
But I'm just here
for the money.

03:33.980 --> 03:37.482
I come here every day,
every single day.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.319
Ready to blow my
fucking brains out.

03:41.754 --> 03:44.723
I even got a special bullet
picked out just for the job.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.625
Hollow point.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.795

Jack
Tara...

04:02.408 --> 04:02.407

04:02.409 --> 04:05.644
This is Dave.
The new guy.

04:08.781 --> 04:08.780
We already met,

04:08.782 --> 04:13.252
in a near glorious moment
at this very register.

04:13.254 --> 04:16.255
Don't be a bitch tera.
It's his first night.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.457
Save it till we're
sure he's staying,

04:18.459 --> 04:20.459
then do the queen
super bitch thing.

04:20.461 --> 04:24.596
Whatever.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.864
Dave

04:26.332 --> 04:29.735
Oh, it's really good.

04:29.737 --> 04:33.672
none of your fucking business
by leave me the fuck alone.

04:34.607 --> 04:34.606
Ever heard of it?

04:36.542 --> 04:38.343
I stopped going to school

04:38.345 --> 04:42.281
like after two years. I mean
i want to be an actress so what

04:42.283 --> 04:45.484

and Greek theater anyway?

04:45.486 --> 04:45.484
You know?

04:45.486 --> 04:50.289
And then I got diagnosed
with anxiety disorder so

04:50.291 --> 04:54.393
I had to start taking
Xanax, like, a lot. And

04:54.395 --> 04:55.394
that kept me from
going back to school.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.398
Jack
she can't help it,
being a bitch and all.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.566
She's got like some
chick disease in her 'wawa'

05:01.568 --> 05:02.834
Jack
takes pills and shit.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.738
Dave
I'm sorry did you say a
chick disease in her wawa?

05:07.473 --> 05:08.707
What does that mean?

05:08.841 --> 05:11.743
Totes don't know
bro, just what I heard.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.346
Hmm.
I mean I fucked
her and I'm alright.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.449
Oh, do you guys
have health insurance?

05:17.451 --> 05:20.719
Because my script
kind of ran out and,

05:20.721 --> 05:24.523
I would totally blow someone
for a Xanax right now.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.330
Okay.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.474
Jack
no. No, no, no. No cell
phones allowed in the store man.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.809
Boss man will take that
from you lickity split

05:43.811 --> 05:44.876
if he finds
you with it.

05:45.845 --> 05:45.844
Seriously?

05:45.846 --> 05:49.848
We had uh, an incident
here,not too long ago.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.852
We call it the uh, "great
Mr. beavers iPhone fuck up"

05:53.854 --> 05:56.555
basically it involved
somebody, won't name names,

05:56.557 --> 05:59.424
takin' a shit in a
display toilet,

05:59.426 --> 06:02.627
snap a cell phone picture.
Bamm! Instagram, Twitter,

06:02.629 --> 06:05.530
hashtag Mr. beaver's
display toilet hell.

06:05.532 --> 06:05.530
Went viral; Got
like a million hits.

06:05.532 --> 06:09.901
Anyway, corporate found out,
they yanked our cell phones.

06:11.704 --> 06:11.703
That's... that's horrible.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.840
I know right. What
right does that give them to

06:14.842 --> 06:16.441
yank our cell phone privileges

06:16.443 --> 06:17.876
fucking fascist man.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.712
What no, no, no. Someone
actually took a shit,

06:20.714 --> 06:22.714
in this display toilet.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.384
Dude, yeah that happens
like three times a week.

06:25.818 --> 06:30.622
No seriously, little kids,
the homeless, elderly people.

06:31.557 --> 06:32.924
I've even dropped a
deuce in it before.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.794
You take a shit in the store?

06:35.895 --> 06:39.731
Not our toilets. I'm talkin'
like lowes, or home depot

06:39.733 --> 06:43.135
no. No I was not fired
from home depot.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.003
Okay, who told you that?
O'tooney? He's full of shit.

06:45.605 --> 06:49.608
I left on my own volition to
pursue other opportunities.

06:50.710 --> 06:54.713
Look I was falsely accused of
shitting in a display toilet.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.949
That's it. I left on my own.
It had nothing to do with that.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.522
Boss hired a rent-a-clause for
Christmas. Barbie was my idea.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.626
Dave
she seems a little
under dressed for Christmas.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.694
Jack

07:14.700 --> 07:16.802

07:16.804 --> 07:21.706

I'd like to give her
a kiss on her camel toe.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.941
Jack

07:22.943 --> 07:25.177
Barbie

07:25.179 --> 07:27.446
Oh my god I'm so excited.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.748
When do I start?
I want to start right now.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.650
Yaay... wait!

07:31.652 --> 07:31.650
Hold up pal...

07:31.652 --> 07:35.854
Do I get to keep my tips or do i
have to split them with Santa?

07:35.856 --> 07:36.922
Jack
you can keep the tip.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.228
Yo, black Jack.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.796
Black Jack
what the fuck
do you want man?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.598
Jack
this here's
Jackson Porter

07:46.600 --> 07:48.533
we call him
black Jack because...

07:48.634 --> 07:50.535
Obviously...

07:50.537 --> 07:52.204
Can you believe this is
the assistant manager?

07:52.206 --> 07:52.204
He thinks he's really
clever. What are you

07:52.206 --> 07:55.941
writing in your book? Some
of your wack black Jack raps?

07:55.943 --> 07:58.076
Man fuck you
white bread.

07:58.678 --> 08:00.946
I'll slit yo'
damn throat.

08:00.948 --> 08:03.915
Whatever man yeah I'm good with
all that. That's no problem

08:03.917 --> 08:06.952
cause I'm so big and strong, but
i ain't yo' house nigga though.

08:06.954 --> 08:10.222
A'ight so don't be puttin me
on that heavy liftin and shit

08:10.224 --> 08:10.222
all the damn time.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.924
That's what I did at
the other fucking store

08:12.926 --> 08:14.526
and I didn't come
here to do that shit.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.695
No lackey work for me.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.665
Get ya' own nigga for that
shit. You know what I'm sayin'?

08:21.267 --> 08:22.801
Dave
so he's a writer?

08:23.703 --> 08:26.605
Jack
what because of
his scribble pad? No.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.673
He's writin'' his
ghetto ass gansta' life

08:28.675 --> 08:30.242
prison logic in there.

08:30.244 --> 08:32.711
You don't know that he
could be working on a book

08:32.712 --> 08:34.712
or some poetry.

08:34.715 --> 08:35.981
And besides, if he
rips you like that,

08:35.982 --> 08:37.249
why don't you
guys just fire him?

08:37.251 --> 08:38.984
Because our
manager, Mr. kipper,

08:38.986 --> 08:40.986
is the biggest
most pathetic pussy

08:40.988 --> 08:44.089
in the entire history
of big pussies ever.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.558
And he's terrified of
that black bastard.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.827
In fact I'm pretty sure he's
terrified of all the coloreds.

08:48.829 --> 08:52.931
Oh I uh, don't think we
refer to them as that anymore.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.033
We do here.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.535
Mr. kipper
we do here what?

08:57.770 --> 09:01.907
Mr. kipper? Ha, ha, oh!

09:01.909 --> 09:04.943
I was just tellin' the new guy
here what a tight ship you run.

09:04.945 --> 09:08.780
Oh, well then
please. Keep talking.

09:10.616 --> 09:14.286
Uh Dave, uh barns,
welcome aboard.

09:14.288 --> 09:18.023
It's so good to have you
on my tight little ship.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.993
Uh Jack, once you've
shown him around,

09:21.995 --> 09:23.895
send him up to
the office alright.

09:24.597 --> 09:26.164
There it is.

09:27.867 --> 09:31.169
Oh my god dude,
how gay was that?

09:31.671 --> 09:33.305
In, in what way?

09:33.307 --> 09:35.740
I don't mean gay
like offensively gay.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.842
I mean gay like he wants to

09:37.844 --> 09:39.911
lick the perspiration
off your ass hole gay.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.113
Oh. Uh, the real gay
way. Yeah no I got it.

09:44.151 --> 09:46.251
Jack!

09:47.653 --> 09:49.788
Otto
did you leave those fritter
wrappers by that paint can

09:49.790 --> 09:51.656
that spilled all over the
filling cabinet? Yes or no boy.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.692
Jack
uh no man, of course not.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.027
My weaknesses?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.929
What in the hell kind of
question is that?

09:57.931 --> 10:01.032
Are you talkin about my
disability caused by some

10:01.034 --> 10:03.969
fucking towel head who shot an
rpg up my ass during my fourth

10:12.746 --> 10:15.080
in upstate my daddy's a rich
prick bought me a Porsche

10:15.082 --> 10:17.682

that would fund the fuckin'

10:17.684 --> 10:19.851
veteran's hospital that
would fix my leg so I could

10:19.853 --> 10:21.753
kick you in your
fuckin' teeth right now?

10:21.755 --> 10:23.355
That disability?

10:23.357 --> 10:23.355
Hey this is
Dave, the new guy.

10:23.357 --> 10:28.026
Dave this is Otto, he's our
store... maintenance guy.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.794
New soldier huh?

10:30.363 --> 10:32.931
You look good son.
Fit, I like that.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.634
I'm the tactical maintenance
team leader which means

10:35.636 --> 10:38.637
I extract and destroy all the
shit these dickwads leave behind

10:38.639 --> 10:40.772
every time they
traipse through my store.

10:40.774 --> 10:41.906
What? What are
you laughing at boy?

10:41.908 --> 10:43.842
That funny?
That funny to you?

10:43.909 --> 10:45.977
You like dumpin' paint
toxins all over the place?

10:45.979 --> 10:48.780
The same brain degenerating
paint toxins that bin ladin

10:48.782 --> 10:50.849
dumped on my ass back in 2005

10:50.851 --> 10:53.385
after I killed his herd of
goats he liked to fuck. Huh?

10:53.387 --> 10:55.053
That's why I'm
blind in one eye boy.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.856
Sorry... about the
blindness and all.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.858
We got some important
orientation stuff to do,

10:59.860 --> 11:01.092
so if you'll excuse us.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.662
Oh do you?
Do you?
So we're just...

11:03.664 --> 11:03.662
Do you?
Yeah.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.731
Well you make sure
this dumb fuck right here

11:06.733 --> 11:08.967
that he knows the difference
between methyl butyl hexane

11:08.969 --> 11:11.136
two and six because what I bet
your dumb ass doesn't know,

11:11.138 --> 11:14.205
is it is easily confused
for dichlor ethane

11:14.407 --> 11:17.809
which is what I used on Saddam
when I water boarded his ass.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.913
Made his dick fall off.
Who's laughin now fucks?

11:21.915 --> 11:27.052

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

11:27.054 --> 11:29.754

a serious case of PTSD.

11:29.756 --> 11:33.892
How bout you say thank you
soldier, god bless America?

11:33.894 --> 11:36.828
And tell me when
i fuckin' start.

11:38.998 --> 11:42.067
This is the hydraulic crane.

11:42.069 --> 11:47.172
Do not tough the hydraulic crane
until you get certified. Ever.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.741
Wow. This thing is awesome.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.044
This thing is like a
deadly weapon around here.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.247
Alright. I-
osha takes this
shit serious.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.283
I take this
shit serious.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.086
Okay, you touch this
without getting certified.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.321
You get fired. Or killed.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.724
Crushed to death before you
even know what happened.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.861
I'm for real man.
Big time danger.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.797
Dude lost an arm
first time I was here.

12:12.799 --> 12:12.797
Who?

12:12.799 --> 12:17.035
Kipper fuckin freaks out over
this thing 16 times a day.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.903
Ah!

12:22.942 --> 12:24.976
Dave
where are
we going?

12:24.978 --> 12:26.911
Jack
up to see
the boss.

12:40.826 --> 12:44.129
Hey, are you cool?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.865
About the elevator?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.833
No man are you cool cool

12:49.135 --> 12:50.034
what do you mean?

12:50.036 --> 12:51.269
Do you do weed?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.205
I've done
some landscaping

12:54.207 --> 12:55.974
no man pot.

12:55.976 --> 12:55.974
No, no, no, no.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.077
You're gonna have to start
if you want to be cool here.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.282
Jack
shhh!
Where are
you going?

13:05.251 --> 13:06.785
Follow me.
Come on.

13:28.207 --> 13:28.206
Dave
what is this?

13:28.208 --> 13:32.010
Old crawl space.
No body knows its up here.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.182
Pharms, you up here?

13:49.862 --> 13:51.362
Jack
this is Dave,
the new guy.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.004
Dave
oh, no, I'm
good thank you.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.841
Pharms
marijuana is the
only way to escape

14:02.843 --> 14:05.343
the drudgery
of this place.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.312
Plus this is some
real good sinsemilla.

14:07.314 --> 14:08.580
What's this one?

14:08.582 --> 14:10.248
Oh. Its a new
mix I'm working on.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.918
I call it sour purple turbo.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.286
Oh yeah.
Try it.

14:23.163 --> 14:26.197
Keep it down,
he'll hear you.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.298
Arms up.
Up in the air.

14:30.103 --> 14:33.204
Pharms
it's, uh, tetrahydrocannabinol
and diacetylmorphine.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.272
Basically
weed and heroin.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.376
Pharms
party foul.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.313
Sorry.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.915
Don't apologize to me.

14:48.255 --> 14:48.253
What is that?

14:48.255 --> 14:50.054
Pharms
bucky the beaver.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.389
Our idol.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.391
I liberated him from
the corporate office

14:53.393 --> 14:55.426
on a peyote
induced vision quest.

14:56.362 --> 15:00.098
Now he resides here, watching
over and protecting us.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.967
We do not offend bucky.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.136
So any party foul
committed in his presence

15:05.138 --> 15:06.905
must be apologized for.

15:06.907 --> 15:07.906
Jack
alright.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.107
And penance paid.

15:12.645 --> 15:12.644
I was gonna
get a fritter later.

15:12.646 --> 15:17.382
We offer to bucky so he may
forgive us our party fouls.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.985
And shield us from
our misery and torment.

15:24.423 --> 15:24.422
Sorry bucky.

15:24.424 --> 15:29.260
Dave
guys, if its so miserable
here, why don't you just quit?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.995
I figure kipper's only
gonna' last so long

15:30.997 --> 15:32.931
before he gets fired
for soliciting sex from

15:32.933 --> 15:34.432
underaged boys online.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.034
Then they'll make me manager.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.170
He has sex with
underaged boys, here?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.272
I don't know,
it's just a theory.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.541
I keep watching that to catch a
predator show waitin to see him.

15:45.177 --> 15:47.278
I get to experiment with
chemicals all day.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.148
Do you have any idea, the
street value of this stuff?

15:51.184 --> 15:51.182
Do I use illegal drugs now?

15:51.184 --> 15:54.385
Do you mean illegal federally
or more on a state level?

15:54.387 --> 15:54.385
Because I can take the drug test

15:54.387 --> 15:58.189
I would just need about thirty
days to you know study for it.

15:58.191 --> 16:03.027
Mr. kipper
Jack will show you the ropes.
He's my second in command.

16:03.029 --> 16:06.297
You'll see we have a strong
mutual respect for each other.

16:09.302 --> 16:13.271
I run a good, solid crew here.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.107
Otto, the two Jacks, terra.

16:16.109 --> 16:20.745
She used to have a bit of a
substance abuse issue.

16:20.747 --> 16:25.717
But, I'm happy to say, we
nipped that problem in the bud.

16:25.719 --> 16:28.186
Now she's a model employee.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.255
We're a team.
We help each other.

16:31.257 --> 16:34.325
So I need you to
do somethin' for me.

16:35.260 --> 16:37.428
Relax kiddo.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.131
I just need to get your
measurements.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.034
Let's start with your
shirt and penis size.

16:43.036 --> 16:43.034
I'm sorry what?

16:43.036 --> 16:47.438
Uh, pants size. Sorry.
Damn auto correct.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.008
So how big are you?

16:50.409 --> 16:52.443
Pants. And shirt.

16:52.445 --> 16:57.248
Oh, um, thirty four long.
Uh, medium shirt maybe.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.084
Ah, Dave.

17:00.086 --> 17:02.754
We need to look our
best around here.

17:02.756 --> 17:06.457
So we need exact
specifications for our uniforms.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.259
It's no big deal.

17:08.261 --> 17:12.463
I'll just take your
measurements on your shoulder.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.034
And let me know if I make you
feel uncomfortable in any way.

17:16.036 --> 17:18.169
Dave
okay.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.238
Mr. kipper
Dave, you're so tense.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.307
It's, uh, first day jitters.
I'm a little nervous.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.276
Mr. kipper
oh, no need for that.

17:25.278 --> 17:29.113
Just think of me as
your friendly uncle.

17:29.115 --> 17:33.384
So you're thirty four in slack.
No jeans? Because I can measure.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.119
No, nope I'm
good I got it yeah.

17:35.121 --> 17:36.354
Okay. Alright then.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.488
Oh. Cell phone.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.824
You'll need to check
that in with me.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.325
Come on, whip it out.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.094
Come on get that out. Come on.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.363
Thank you.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.132
Mr. kipper
there's nothing to worry about.

17:48.134 --> 17:54.338
It's safe in here,
and no one can steal it.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.240
See.

17:56.242 --> 18:00.111
Oh and no one's gonna
look through it for any

18:00.113 --> 18:02.313
sexting pictures you
may have left on it. Huh?

18:02.315 --> 18:05.416

18:05.418 --> 18:08.252

Okay?

19:00.473 --> 19:04.208

Mr. kipper
oh. Ah. Alright somethin'
funny is goin' on here.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.232
Maybe we should
open that darn thing up.

19:28.234 --> 19:29.233
What's the matter?

19:29.235 --> 19:32.670
We'll see?
Theft perhaps.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.449
What?

19:49.588 --> 19:51.322
Mr. kipper

know this gentleman?

19:55.227 --> 19:58.930
Sir, are you okay?

19:58.932 --> 20:03.568

20:06.272 --> 20:08.406

meeting. Thank you very much.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.412
Your attention please.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.747
All employees
report to aisle 12.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.583
That's the flooring aisle...

20:19.418 --> 20:20.651
The one with the dead body...

20:27.559 --> 20:28.659
Jack
wonder what's in the bag.

20:28.661 --> 20:29.760
Black Jack
don't touch it man.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.462
Why not?

20:31.464 --> 20:31.462
Black Jack

20:31.464 --> 20:35.466
they need this place un-fucked
with. Don't touch it.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.002
I can un-zip the bag enough that
it won't fuck it all up.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.771
Okay smart ass. When the cops
get here, be sure and tell them

20:40.773 --> 20:42.740

Oh come on. He punched me in the
face. I'm the assistant manager.

24:16.656 --> 24:19.790
The store's closed.
You're off duty.

This money belongs to this dead
dude, and we are not takin' it.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.654
Otto
damn right. If the black guy
ain't stealin' it, nobody is.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.691
I understand if some of you are
uncomfortable with the situation

24:53.693 --> 24:56.994
so I'd like to offer you all the
option of just going home.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.996
What the fuck. Sir
you don't run from war.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.233
Otto, it's Christmas Eve.
We'll be here all night.

25:02.235 --> 25:04.034
I'll deal with the
authorities myself.

25:04.036 --> 25:07.004
Negative one-fairy-bravo.
We're stayin' right here.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.006
Damn right we're stayin'
here. Look Mr. kipper,

25:09.008 --> 25:13.644

Everybody, we need to stay here.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.246
Pharms

25:15.248 --> 25:16.814
Dave

25:16.816 --> 25:18.616
I'm not.

25:18.618 --> 25:23.621
Sir. The infidels
are already plotting.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.122
Pharms
you wanna
split the cash?

25:25.825 --> 25:30.628
I fuckin' hate all of you.
Fuckers.

25:31.296 --> 25:34.965
The store is closed.
Oh no!

25:34.967 --> 25:36.667
You're off duty.

25:36.669 --> 25:40.070
You're just gonna
get punched in the face.

25:40.072 --> 25:44.775
You're the assistant manager
but nobody fucking cares.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.777
Fuckin' hate you all.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.156
I may have
to take steps.

26:00.892 --> 26:02.927
I may have
to take steps.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.729
Black Jack
hey look, we need
to call the cops.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.330
Says who?

26:06.332 --> 26:07.598
Says me.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.899
He can't use
that money now.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.969
I have tuition to pay. We
can all split this up.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.773
No. No we can't because this
money doesn't belong to us.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.341
This money belongs
to uncle Sam.

26:17.343 --> 26:19.810
Umm, I agree. I think
we should split it.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.979
Look, I don't give a fuck how
much you need the money.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.981
It's not yours bitch!

26:25.317 --> 26:26.850
I say we vote.

26:26.852 --> 26:29.053

26:29.055 --> 26:30.788
Santa

motion to vote.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.323
We said no vote.

27:05.224 --> 27:08.092

27:08.094 --> 27:10.761
Mr. kipper
Jack. Where did you get that?

27:10.763 --> 27:13.163

27:13.165 --> 27:15.366
Black Jack

27:15.368 --> 27:16.867
I want an apology.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.737

27:27.113 --> 27:29.980
Fuck that man. He

Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

27:40.426 --> 27:40.424

27:40.426 --> 27:43.160
What does he, what does
he mean. What do you mean?

27:43.695 --> 27:44.762
He's turbo charged.

27:45.030 --> 27:45.029
Shut up!

27:45.031 --> 27:50.000
Mr. kipper
Jack. Are you on drugs?

27:50.002 --> 27:50.934
You apologize.

27:50.936 --> 27:50.934

27:56.208 --> 27:56.206
Man I'm callin' your bluff.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.976
I don't think you're

27:58.978 --> 28:00.110
Shoot me bitch.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.046
Black Jack

28:25.805 --> 28:25.803
Don't! You

28:25.805 --> 28:28.739
Leave it alone you
stupid son of a bitch.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.107
You leave a
puncture wound.

28:30.109 --> 28:30.107
You leave a
puncture wound.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.110
Well I didn't know that.
How would I know that.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.812
I don't-
I'm really
really sorry.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.114
Otto

28:40.085 --> 28:43.220
Dave

28:44.222 --> 28:46.023
Merry fucking Christmas.

28:46.257 --> 28:50.260
Now okay, I know this is
not the greatest timing but-

28:50.829 --> 28:52.463
here's how we're
gonna' do things.

28:52.465 --> 28:52.463
Santa
uh, uh, uh,

28:52.465 --> 28:57.000
back off. Or you're gonna
go on Santa's naughty list.

28:58.103 --> 29:00.137
I will use this thing.

29:02.173 --> 29:03.273
Intentionally.

29:04.776 --> 29:08.245
Barbie baby.
Grab the money.

29:10.782 --> 29:13.016
Black Jack
hey what are you
doin' you drunk fuck.

29:13.018 --> 29:16.186
Snata
ha, ha. I'm tired
of givin' presents.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.189
It's time for
Santa to get some.

29:20.792 --> 29:20.791
What's this?

29:20.793 --> 29:24.228
I, I wouldn't touch
that. It's a dye pack.

29:25.296 --> 29:26.797
Come, come,
let me see that.

29:27.932 --> 29:28.999
Thank you.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.203
Warning. Contents
under extreme-

29:33.972 --> 29:34.972
Santa
woah!

29:34.974 --> 29:36.874
Tara
oh my god!

29:37.876 --> 29:37.875
Black Jack
fuck!

29:41.513 --> 29:44.381
That is going to be one
messy workman's comp claim.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.785
Jack, get the pap-

29:49.220 --> 29:50.788
Jack?

29:53.025 --> 29:56.894
Jack
ladies and gentleman. Thank you
for shopping at Mr. beavers.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.930
The store is now
closed for the evening.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.900
However, none of us are
leaving until we figure out what

30:02.902 --> 30:04.268
we're doing with all
this great money.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.537
Anybody thinks otherwise.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.972
I locked the store.
I set the alarms.

30:08.974 --> 30:10.874
And for your
further inconvenience.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.276
I cut the phone lines.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.278
I'm kind of a little
high right now.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.981
And, I'm pretty sure I'm going
to be fired in the morning for,

30:18.883 --> 30:23.053
a, smoking pot in
the store, and uh, uh,

30:23.055 --> 30:26.023
2, shootin' Otto
with a crossbow.

30:26.025 --> 30:28.091
But uh, I've decided,

30:30.895 --> 30:33.330
I'm not leavin'
till I get that money.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.901
Where are our phones Mr. kipper.
Are they still in your office?

30:37.903 --> 30:39.236
Oh there's a cell phone

30:39.238 --> 30:40.337
party goin' on right now in the

30:40.339 --> 30:40.337
shitter by the way.

30:40.339 --> 30:45.342
Now that my high is wearin'
off, I'm startin to realize that

30:45.344 --> 30:47.578
whoever killed that
guy in the box probably

30:47.580 --> 30:49.246
wants that money too.

30:50.582 --> 30:53.250
And he'll probably
kill us all for it.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.386
And if one of us is the killer.

30:58.223 --> 30:59.990
I just locked us
in here with him.

31:02.927 --> 31:04.928
Folks.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.363
We have a situation here.

31:06.998 --> 31:07.898
Black Jack
well no shit.

31:07.900 --> 31:08.899
Otto
he's loosin' it.

31:08.901 --> 31:10.000
Pharms
he's trippin' hard.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.068
It's you.

31:12.036 --> 31:12.035
What?

31:12.037 --> 31:14.104
You did it. You killed him.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.073
The fuck are you
talkin' about man?

31:16.075 --> 31:17.374
You didn't want
Mr. kipper to help

31:17.376 --> 31:19.076
and then you pretended
it wasn't heavy.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.144
Come on man. It
wasn't even like that.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.379
You said it was slippery.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.050
Look man. I didn't do t is shit.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.119
I didn't even know this
mother fucker was in there.

31:29.121 --> 31:29.119
Oh that's bull shit.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.422
I'm not shittin you. I
didn't kill this dude.

31:33.024 --> 31:34.625
I don't even
want the fuckin' money.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.894
But I can't let you
all take it either.

31:39.163 --> 31:39.997
Why not?

31:39.999 --> 31:39.997
What you mean why not?

31:39.999 --> 31:44.635
If we take this money it
looks like we killed this man.

31:44.637 --> 31:46.370
Black Jack
and that's what the
cops are gonnna' think.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.205
I want no part to that shit.

31:48.207 --> 31:48.205
Why didn't you tell me

31:48.207 --> 31:51.975
you suspected a possible
employee theft Jackson.

31:51.977 --> 31:55.412
Black Jack
Mr. kippler. Shut the fuck
up. I didn't kill this man.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.180
Now that's the end of that shit.

31:57.649 --> 31:59.249
Jackson, you're fired.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.984
Oh you got balls now?

32:00.986 --> 32:00.984
Pharms
i don't know Jackson.

32:00.986 --> 32:05.255
You have a violent
disposition. A quick temper.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.991
And of course you're
black. The odds point to you.

32:07.993 --> 32:09.259
Shit the odds point to you.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.261
The dope dealer holdin'
a dangerous weapon

32:11.263 --> 32:12.396
pointin' at people and shit.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.197
Two to one says you did it.

32:14.199 --> 32:16.400
I'd say you're more two to one
odds. I'm kind of three to one.

32:17.435 --> 32:20.170
And I did not even
use this. Jack did.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.673
I'd put even odds on him.

32:22.675 --> 32:24.541
We can't forget
about the new guy,

32:25.677 --> 32:29.246
I mean I'd say his squeaky
clean ass four to one odds.

32:29.248 --> 32:30.414
I think he did it.

32:31.215 --> 32:32.349
Long shot odds on kipper.

32:33.318 --> 32:34.451
Ten to one?

32:34.453 --> 32:35.385
What about me?

32:37.356 --> 32:37.354
I could have done it.

32:37.356 --> 32:42.025
Dark horse. You're too fuckin
stupid to kill somebody.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.994
And put 'em in a damn box.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.996
Hundred to one odds

Alright. Last chance guys.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.035

32:54.974 --> 32:58.275

35:18.350 --> 35:21.485

You wouldn't believe what I made
in here. All from that book.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.330
All from stuff
inside this store.

35:33.332 --> 35:33.330
You didn't take
anything did you?

35:33.332 --> 35:37.501

35:37.503 --> 35:39.236

35:39.238 --> 35:41.505

36:08.432 --> 36:11.902

A nervous breakdown.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.404
Of some kind....

36:15.339 --> 36:18.642
Come on Jack. Relax. Remember.

36:18.644 --> 36:23.513
You're a sea man
on my tight little ship.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.651
Whenever we, are at sea,
all you can think about is me.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.453
Kipper. I think
it's gonna be you.

36:30.621 --> 36:33.557
Otto
Jack. You listen to me son.

36:33.559 --> 36:38.728
Now you got to be very careful
with that acid that is a highly

36:38.730 --> 36:41.398
corrosive solvent.
That is what I used

36:41.400 --> 36:42.732
to assassinate Kim jong il.

36:43.568 --> 36:44.734
I know, I know.

36:46.237 --> 36:50.407
All I needed was styrofoam,
and polyurethane, salt,

36:50.409 --> 36:54.578
and orange juice. Tara, sorry
i drank your orange juice.

36:54.580 --> 36:54.578
That is okay.

36:54.580 --> 36:57.547
Pharms

want the money?

36:57.549 --> 36:58.715

39:22.694 --> 39:24.527
He's been embezzling for years.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.364

44:42.713 --> 44:45.882
Okay, umm... how do they

44:45.884 --> 44:49.018

45:11.775 --> 45:13.943
Enough fucking around.
I am getting a crow bar.

45:54.818 --> 45:55.752
Otto

45:55.754 --> 45:56.819
Dave

45:56.821 --> 45:59.255

45:59.257 --> 46:01.224
Otto

46:01.226 --> 46:02.925
Dave

46:04.495 --> 46:05.495
Ah!

46:05.497 --> 46:07.764
Oh my god!
Are you okay?

46:07.965 --> 46:09.832
I- am- not- okay-

46:09.834 --> 46:10.900
Dave
holy shit!

46:14.271 --> 46:15.838
Dave

46:26.016 --> 46:27.083
Dave

46:36.260 --> 46:37.560
Jack
careful!

46:37.562 --> 46:38.995
Dave
shit!

46:39.963 --> 46:41.164
I thought you were killed.

46:41.166 --> 46:44.867
Jack
almost. What'd I miss?

46:44.869 --> 46:46.869
Pharms is dead.

46:46.871 --> 46:49.071
Ah. Overdose?

46:49.073 --> 46:51.207
Maybe some
lead poisoning.

46:51.942 --> 46:53.042
Barbie's dead too.

46:53.044 --> 46:55.578
Oh. That's a shame.

46:55.580 --> 46:57.947
Yeah. It was pretty shocking.

46:58.849 --> 47:00.082
Mr. kipper has the money.

47:00.084 --> 47:00.082
And just where are you going?

47:00.084 --> 47:05.188
Headin home man. It's been
a really rough first day.

47:05.190 --> 47:08.558
Plus I got to be back at
8:00 am to open up the store.

47:08.560 --> 47:12.028
We got that breakfast with Santa
promotion thing going on.

47:12.030 --> 47:15.832
Oh. Santa's dead
too. By the way.

47:15.834 --> 47:19.068
Uh, will we be
renting a Santa clause

47:19.070 --> 47:21.170
because I'm not sure how that's
gonna work if he's not here and

47:21.172 --> 47:23.873
the kids show up and all that
kind of stuff with the pictures.

47:23.875 --> 47:23.873
What about gettin' the money.

47:23.875 --> 47:27.877
Well you know as
odds play out I figure uh,

47:27.879 --> 47:31.848
our chances of survival drop.
It's all becoming a pattern man

47:31.850 --> 47:33.983
you know uh people bein'
killed and that kind of stuff.

47:33.985 --> 47:36.185
And I'm under the impression
that only one of us is gonna

47:36.187 --> 47:38.254
make it out of here alive so, uh

47:38.256 --> 47:41.290
if we do, most likely
also we'll be in jail.

47:41.959 --> 47:41.958
So if you don't mind.

47:41.960 --> 47:46.262
I'm just gonna slip out of
here if that's okay with you.

47:46.264 --> 47:47.897
Jack
not so fast.

47:47.899 --> 47:51.167
You see if you leave.
You trip the alarms.

47:51.169 --> 47:53.302
And if you trip the
alarms the cops come.

47:53.304 --> 47:56.072
And if the cops come,
they take us all to jail.

47:57.207 --> 47:59.075
And you can't go
interfering with everybody's

47:59.077 --> 48:01.344
god given rights to stay
and kill each other.

48:03.213 --> 48:05.248
You know you're
fucked up, right Jack.

48:05.250 --> 48:09.886
You almost killed Otto. You shot
him with a fuckin' cross bow.

48:09.888 --> 48:14.991
Yeah, I am totes embarrassed
by that whole thing. Is he mad

48:14.993 --> 48:16.425
he's fuckin' dead.

48:17.227 --> 48:18.961
Oh you didn't do
it. You didn't do it.

48:18.963 --> 48:20.229
Uh, somebody else did.

48:20.231 --> 48:22.331
They shot him right
in the face with a gun.

48:22.333 --> 48:22.331
Thank god.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.967
I came around the corner though

48:24.969 --> 48:28.204
and I thought heard somethin'
uh call me a cock suckin'-

48:28.206 --> 48:29.338
Dave, you think about it.

48:29.340 --> 48:33.109
Your odds of being the one that
survives are pretty good.

48:33.111 --> 48:36.112
You know with pharms out of the
way, who's your competition?

48:36.114 --> 48:36.112
Black Jack?

48:36.114 --> 48:41.484
Dave
well there's Mr. kipper.
He's the one who has a gun.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.922
What about you?

48:45.924 --> 48:48.190
Me?

48:49.192 --> 48:51.294
I was never much of a
competitor in anything.

48:53.230 --> 48:56.999
Especially in school I was
always the last one picked.

48:57.001 --> 48:58.334
First one eliminated.

48:59.136 --> 49:01.070
Especially in duck duck goose.

49:03.006 --> 49:05.942
Besides, in this condition i
probably won't last very long.

49:07.244 --> 49:11.447
Either way, let's not tell the
rest of the group I'm alive.

49:12.683 --> 49:15.051
Let's mix it up a little bit.

49:15.986 --> 49:17.453
How do you know I won't?

49:18.422 --> 49:19.488
Oh...

49:30.033 --> 49:31.434
Jack
you bitch!

49:32.502 --> 49:35.204
Mr. kipper
Dave?

49:36.239 --> 49:37.506
Dave...

49:39.443 --> 49:42.178
No sleeping
on the job.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.080
Dave
Mr. kipper?

49:44.181 --> 49:45.481
Mr. kipper
you took quite a pounding.

49:45.483 --> 49:48.084
I had to do the heimlich

49:51.054 --> 49:52.521
finally got that measurement.

49:53.323 --> 49:55.057
Dave
what the fuck?

50:05.335 --> 50:07.403
Dave
holy shit!

50:13.043 --> 50:13.042
Black Jack
hey what took
you so long?

50:13.044 --> 50:16.145
Dave
well since the guy from the
tool department is dead.

50:16.147 --> 50:17.380
I had to grab this myself.

50:18.448 --> 50:19.515
Where's Tara?
Tara

50:20.517 --> 50:21.784
Dave

50:21.786 --> 50:21.784
Tara

50:21.786 --> 50:21.784
Black Jack

mean is she okay.

50:21.786 --> 50:26.088
What you think i
raped the girl or somethin?

50:26.090 --> 50:28.090
How bout I rape

50:28.092 --> 50:31.093
You next. Get in line. Touch
your toes motherfucker.

50:31.095 --> 50:33.095
Relax. I didn't say
anything about rape alright.

50:33.097 --> 50:34.597
Black Jack
I'll relax when
we get this money.

50:34.599 --> 50:37.233
So what you gonnna do, stand
there lookin' the fuck stupid?

50:37.235 --> 50:39.035
Or you tryin' to
smash the door in?

50:39.770 --> 50:39.769
Let's go son!

50:39.771 --> 50:43.372
That wasn't a request.
Smash the fuckin' door in!

50:45.509 --> 50:46.575
Dave
he's not in here.

50:46.577 --> 50:48.177
Tara
what the fuck!

50:48.779 --> 50:50.179
Dave
he's in the ventilation.

50:52.250 --> 50:55.284
Black Jack
kipper. What you doin?

50:55.286 --> 51:00.389
You think you're
Bruce fuckin' Willis?

51:03.360 --> 51:06.195
Mr. kipper
you're a sailer on
my tight little ship.

51:07.364 --> 51:08.464
He's got the money.

51:08.832 --> 51:10.099
We should
go after him.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.834
Uh, I'm not going in there.

51:11.836 --> 51:11.834
Yeah me neither.

51:11.836 --> 51:14.470
We need to find out
where this thing leads to.

51:16.406 --> 51:19.809
Is this where we find out one of
our coworkers has a secret past?

51:19.811 --> 51:23.612
Something like that.
Otto Daniels frink.

51:23.614 --> 51:25.181
The maintenance guy?

51:25.183 --> 51:26.849
What does it say?

51:26.851 --> 51:30.352
Why would you make a
good Mr. beavers employee?

51:30.354 --> 51:35.524
Honorable discharge, united
states naval intelligence.

51:35.526 --> 51:39.095
Distinguished service.
Undercover operations.

51:39.097 --> 51:40.596
Freedom medal...

51:41.531 --> 51:43.632
Applying for sales associate.

51:43.634 --> 51:46.168
I just put down good with people

51:46.170 --> 51:47.837
I left mine blank.

51:47.839 --> 51:47.837
So what does this mean.

51:47.839 --> 51:51.173
It means that he could be
involved with the dead body.

51:51.175 --> 51:52.508
I don't know like
a military thing.

51:52.510 --> 51:54.477
Hey, look!

51:54.479 --> 51:55.644
Let me see that.

51:58.182 --> 51:59.849
What does it say?

51:59.851 --> 52:02.118
He knew I was undercover.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.686
How do you know that?

52:07.891 --> 52:10.659
Kipper, a methodical genius?

52:10.661 --> 52:10.659
No way.

52:10.661 --> 52:13.395
Think about it for
a second guys.

52:13.397 --> 52:16.132
Alright, he kills Otto
first chance he gets.

52:16.134 --> 52:19.535
Shoots him because he knows. He
knows that Otto is a threat.

52:20.904 --> 52:22.404
Let's go get this mother fucker.

52:40.657 --> 52:42.358
Dave
hey I've been meaning
to ask you guys.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.260
How come no body
else wears their uniforms.

52:44.262 --> 52:47.463
Tara
what? We don't
get uniforms here.

52:48.165 --> 52:50.533
Dave
Mr. kipper measured me for a
shirt and pair of pants,

52:50.535 --> 52:52.501
and he was very specific
on the measurements.

52:52.503 --> 52:53.569
Tara
look!

52:54.905 --> 52:56.338
Dave
the vent goes three ways.

52:58.441 --> 52:59.742
Black Jack
well let's split up.

53:00.177 --> 53:01.577
Tara
uh, I don't think so.

53:02.245 --> 53:03.679
Dave
why not?

53:03.681 --> 53:05.781
Tara
well, what do i
do if I find him?

53:06.616 --> 53:07.650
Tara
he has a gun.

53:07.652 --> 53:07.650
Dave
i don't know. Yell.

53:07.652 --> 53:11.253
Hope he doesn't shoot
you before we get there.

53:11.255 --> 53:12.388
Black Jack
wait here.

53:12.390 --> 53:13.389
Take this.

53:13.391 --> 53:13.389
Tara

53:13.391 --> 53:17.626
Black Jack

If you know what I mean.

53:58.335 --> 53:59.401
Otto

54:03.573 --> 54:03.572

54:03.574 --> 54:07.009
Black Jack

scare black people man.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.010

54:46.617 --> 54:47.816
Black Jack
and we can't get in.

54:48.518 --> 54:50.319
We have to go
through the vents.

54:50.321 --> 54:51.687
Dave
i have an idea.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.693
Tara
Mr. kipper?

54:58.561 --> 55:01.430
If you're in there.
You should just come out.

Please...

55:05.770 --> 55:07.569
Tara

55:07.571 --> 55:07.569
Black Jack

55:07.571 --> 55:10.439
Tara

just saw a ghost.

55:11.441 --> 55:11.440
Dave

55:11.442 --> 55:14.576
Black Jack

55:15.378 --> 55:19.581
Tara

Uh. Never mind.

55:23.787 --> 55:26.355
Black Jack

Dave

come out and when he does,

55:28.793 --> 55:30.326
it'll be up there.

55:30.328 --> 55:33.462
Keep spraying with these foggers
till this cockroach comes out.

55:41.604 --> 55:44.740
[ Mr. kipper coughing
and sputtering

56:17.440 --> 56:19.541

56:27.450 --> 56:29.685
Dave

You ever stab someone

56:36.726 --> 56:38.827

56:38.829 --> 56:41.130
Shit! I'm going to

damn child support.

56:43.434 --> 56:43.432
Seriously?

56:43.434 --> 56:47.703
Fuck no! Racist mother fucker.
I ain't got no damn kids.

56:47.705 --> 56:49.872

stupid ass rims!

56:49.874 --> 56:53.442
How am I racist? You're
the one that said it.

56:53.444 --> 56:54.810
You was thinkin'
it mother fucker!

56:54.812 --> 56:57.713
Shit! All you white
people are the same.

56:59.616 --> 57:02.151
But I am worried
about somethin' though.

57:02.153 --> 57:03.752
What's that?

57:03.754 --> 57:04.853
You.

57:04.855 --> 57:06.622
Me?

57:06.624 --> 57:08.791
You're the one
holdin' this all together.

57:08.793 --> 57:09.958
You're the star here

57:09.960 --> 57:12.494
to you we're
just supportin' cast.

57:12.496 --> 57:14.797
And you're the hero.

57:14.799 --> 57:16.765
That's not true.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.634
You barely even know my name.

57:18.636 --> 57:20.169
No I know your name.
You're black Jack

57:20.171 --> 57:22.571
my name is Jackson Porter bitch.

57:22.573 --> 57:24.840
And why would you even want
to split the money with us?

57:24.842 --> 57:26.775
Because we all had a deal.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.477
Did we shake hands?

57:28.479 --> 57:30.612
Did we sign a contract?

57:30.614 --> 57:32.981
Every time I turn around I'm
gettin' shafted by the company.

57:32.983 --> 57:36.852
Undercover here. Miss my life
there. And for what?

57:36.854 --> 57:39.588
Where's my reward?
At the end of the day

57:39.590 --> 57:41.890
I'm just another brother
gettin' shafted by the man

57:41.892 --> 57:43.725
but not anymore.

57:44.661 --> 57:48.897
The way I see it.
It's every man for himself.

58:01.244 --> 58:04.580
Dave
kipper!

58:18.962 --> 58:21.830
Kipper
i know you're out there Dave.

58:21.832 --> 58:24.533
You almost shot me
just now Mr. kipper.

58:24.535 --> 58:27.569
Yes. I know you moved though.

58:27.571 --> 58:27.569
Sorry about that.

58:27.571 --> 58:31.907
Mr. kipper
oh no sweat kiddo.
I'll aim better next time.

58:34.777 --> 58:36.578
So where is everyone?

58:36.580 --> 58:40.582
Black Jack's out
here. He's dead.

58:40.584 --> 58:42.718
He is?

58:42.720 --> 58:44.286
Did I kill him?

58:44.288 --> 58:45.854
Nope, that was me.

58:45.856 --> 58:46.955
Mr. kipper
oh...

58:46.957 --> 58:50.692
I see you found
out his secret identity.

58:51.895 --> 58:53.061
And Tara?

58:53.063 --> 58:55.831
She's down stairs.
Spraying the foggers.

58:55.833 --> 58:58.600
I assumed it was her.

58:58.602 --> 59:00.302
Actually that was my idea.

59:00.304 --> 59:02.271
Mr. kipper
very good one.
It worked perfectly.

59:02.273 --> 59:10.646
You wold have been a real
asset to my staff Dave.

59:17.620 --> 59:18.887
Dave
what are you doing?

59:18.889 --> 59:18.887
I was just trying to see

59:18.889 --> 59:21.757
if I could shoot
you through the wall.

59:21.759 --> 59:23.659
Oh. Lucky me.

59:23.661 --> 59:29.798
You know Dave. You should just
leave. I have the gun. You and

59:29.800 --> 59:32.668
the Scooby gang can't beat that
no matter how hard you try.

59:32.670 --> 59:35.604
Why don't you just
split it with us?

59:35.606 --> 59:37.839
Because when more than
one person is in on a secret,

59:37.841 --> 59:39.074
the secret gets out.

59:39.076 --> 59:41.944
You see one guy, one secret.

59:41.946 --> 59:46.014
One guy, one druggie
bitch and one punk kid,

59:46.016 --> 59:48.850
Mr. kipper
the secret gets blown.

59:48.852 --> 59:51.019
Who's the dead guy?

59:51.021 --> 59:52.988
Mr. kipper
how the hell should I know?

59:52.990 --> 59:56.925
I figure pharms did it.
He was always a

59:56.927 --> 01:00:00.329
closet sicko type.

01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:01.697
We all assumed it was you.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:02.864
Mr. kipper
of course you did...

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.934
I know what you
all assumed about me.

01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:08.604
Homo kipper...
Cock sucker kipper.

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:10.138
Oh believe me I know.

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.141
But I know all the secrets.

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:18.647
You see, I know about under
cover action Jackson.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:23.118
About the drugs. About the
stealing. See I know it all.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:27.623
Sometimes, playing dumb
works to your advantage.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.791
I guess it does.

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:32.894
So now we wait.

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:36.131
Fine.

01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.033
Fine.

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:52.981
Son of a bitch.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:54.049
Dave
what's that?

01:00:54.051 --> 01:00:56.385
Oh nothing.

01:00:56.387 --> 01:01:01.757
Say Dave. Would you still
consider splitting the money,

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:04.826
even though I tried to kill you?

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.396
Change of heart now Mr. kipper?

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:10.766
You might say that.

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:11.767
What brought that on?

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:16.938
I'm out of bullets.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:17.873
You're out of bullets.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:19.875
Yes...

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:24.813
Okay. Why don' you go ahead
and toss the gun out here.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:29.051
Oh, of course.

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:34.856
Oh. Oops, sorry. I missed.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.759
Dave
okay. I'm coming in.

01:01:41.065 --> 01:01:42.964
Damn it Dave. You lied.

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.146
Damn!

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:05.187
Jack
Tara!

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.856
Tara
shit! God!

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:10.025
You scared the crap out of me.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.028
We all thought you were dead.

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.463
So did I.

01:02:14.465 --> 01:02:17.132
But I decided to stick
around for a little while.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:20.836
Tara
can I have some.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:26.041
Come on! Sharing is caring.

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.111
And what do I get?

01:02:29.113 --> 01:02:33.949
Ew! I am not fucking
you right now.

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.817
Why not?

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:38.487
Because you look like
a flesh eaten zombie.

01:02:38.489 --> 01:02:41.790
So... sharing is
caring you just said so.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:44.493
That was before your flesh
got burnt off by acid.

01:02:44.495 --> 01:02:46.762
Oh come on!

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.964
Seriously?

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:51.066
You've done so much worse.

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:54.503
You let those eight Mexicans run
a train on you at olive garden

01:02:54.505 --> 01:02:58.106
because they said they'd
give you endless salad.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:01.843
That's free.
Everybody gets that.

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:07.249
Come on Tara... please....

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:10.085
Ah! Oh my god!

01:03:10.087 --> 01:03:12.287
Ah! I swear to
god I'll be fast.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.823
I'm fast. Faster than
a car alarm even.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:17.225
Come on and just,
just fuck me please Tara

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:18.293
fine!

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.063
Yay!

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:24.966
Jack
uh! Oh! That's so good.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.568
Ah! Ah! Ah!

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.303
Ah... oops!

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.813
You know Dave, I don't
even have the money.

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:47.289
Dave?

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:06.141
Mr. kipper
Dave? Dave?

01:04:22.191 --> 01:04:24.860
Jack
hey new guy. You alive?

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.063
Dave
i need help.

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:30.599
Hey listen. I'd love to
stay and chat about it.

01:04:30.601 --> 01:04:32.067
You know the line.

01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:34.169
Dead relatives welcoming
you and all but,

01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:37.606
I have absolutely got to
go and kill Mr. kipper.

01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:42.344
Hey, check this out.
I'm gonna use a chain saw.

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:44.179
Isn't that wicked?

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:44.179
Dave
let me go.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:47.649
Jack
you are absolutely
not even into this.

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:51.253
Dave
i need an ambulance, Jack.

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:53.021
Jack
hey, I'll make you a deal.

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:54.623
After I cut kipper into bits...

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:56.958
I'll come back and
dice you up too.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.895
Quickly though... okay?

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:05.267
Jack
what? I can't hear you.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:09.404
Chain saw!

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:11.439
I'll be back!

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:17.946
Hey, you didn't tell me
black Jack was dead.

01:05:17.948 --> 01:05:19.681
Maybe I'll chop him up too.

01:05:21.685 --> 01:05:24.386
Mr. kipper
ah! Ah, ah, no!

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:57.352
Mr. kipper
oh Dave, Dave...

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:58.987
Dave
wait! Wait!

01:05:58.989 --> 01:06:00.388
What? What?

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:02.023
You're out of bullets.

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:05.360
Oh the hell I am. It's a six
shot. There's one left.

01:06:05.362 --> 01:06:09.297
Dave
pharms, Otto, Jack. You
fired at me three times.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.499
No, no. I shot you twice.

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:14.369
Dave
no wait, wait, wait...

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:15.704
Who's the dead guy?

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:17.439
I don't know!

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.107
And I don't think
we'll ever know.

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:20.141
You killed him.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.044
No! No, no, no!

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:26.348
But I think I know who did.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:29.217
Who was the one person

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:31.753
who wasn't with us
when we found the body?

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:33.455
Dave
pharms?
Mr. kipper
no

01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:35.256
Otto?
Uh-uh.

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:37.092
Santa claus?
Are you serious?

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.460
Tara?
Please?

01:06:38.462 --> 01:06:40.395
Jack?
Dave!

01:06:40.397 --> 01:06:42.397
Black Jack?
No!

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:44.766
You?
No, no, no...

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:46.401
Mitch.

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.103
Who the fuck is Mitch?

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:50.005
Mitch kalper.

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:53.108
He didn't show
up for work tonight

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.410
that's why you had to
come in.

01:06:55.412 --> 01:06:59.381
Oh please. Someone must
have mentioned that to you.

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:02.183
Ex-con. Did time for robbery...

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.253
Uh, got hired
because he sued us.

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.088
Corporate wanted to
keep it confidential

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:10.191
because... that's
the way they are.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:14.095
Look but,
i was collecting evidence....

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:15.330
Because he was stealing...

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:18.366
And I was going to have
him arrested and fired.

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:19.768
I don't understand.

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:22.237
Oh! Forget
about it. Old news.

01:07:22.239 --> 01:07:27.242
The point is, we're never going
to find out who killed that guy.

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:33.148
You see, in real life you don't
always have surprise endings.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.583
Sometimes the truth
is just... just boring.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:40.789
Anyway Dave, your employment
here just isn't working out.

01:07:40.791 --> 01:07:43.458
So I would consider
this, a termination.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.526
No. No!

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:45.627
Black Jack
kipper!

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:49.597
You again?

01:07:51.268 --> 01:07:52.534
Dave
i told you!

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.242
Black Jack... you're
my little sea man right?

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:12.821
Mr kipper
oh... ah... no!

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:19.359
Black Jack
i knew that mother fucker
was gonna try to bounce.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:22.130
Where you think you goin'?

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.298
Just... oh god...

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.365
Where's the money?

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:25.500
I don't know man.

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:28.470
Seriously...
Where'd kipper stash it?

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.371
No! I don't know!

01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:36.243
Fine. This is how
you wanna play?

01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:59.600
Jack
always keepin' an eye on me.

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.288
- Fuck!
- [Slamming phone down

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.774
Jack
Mr. kipper!

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:43.278
I'm so happy you're still alive.

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.581
Mr. kipper
Jack! Please.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:49.684
You do know, killing you is
going to be the absolute

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:53.421
highlight of my night.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.489
Mr. kipper
Jack...

01:09:56.692 --> 01:10:00.261
Bye Mr. kipper.
Merry Christmas.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:02.330
There's something that
you should know.
