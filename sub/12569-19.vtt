Jessie, can I

00:03.756 --> 00:04.756
bring Lucy,

00:04.797 --> 00:06.112
our class bunny rabbit,

00:06.113 --> 00:07.425
home for the weekend?

00:07.466 --> 00:08.656
Zuri! When it comes

00:08.657 --> 00:09.844
to responsibility,

00:09.886 --> 00:11.446
- you don't have
- a great track record.

00:11.470 --> 00:12.638
Remember when

00:12.639 --> 00:13.806
you promised to start

00:11.470 --> 00:13.806
flossing regularly?

00:13.848 --> 00:15.808
I floss my teeth!

00:15.850 --> 00:17.351
- Really? At your
- last cleaning,

00:17.393 --> 00:18.978
There was so

00:18.979 --> 00:20.563
much blood,

00:17.393 --> 00:20.563
the dentist fainted.

00:20.605 --> 00:21.752
He went down

00:21.753 --> 00:22.899
like a submarine.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.030
- Wow! That is some
- hyperactive homework.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.533
Huh!

00:33.952 --> 00:35.037
Hmm, that's

00:35.038 --> 00:36.120
interesting.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.810
I don't remember

00:37.811 --> 00:39.457
packing you

00:36.161 --> 00:39.457
a bunny for lunch.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.292
I might've already

00:41.293 --> 00:43.085
volunteered. Oops.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.338
- Zuri, the sewers
- are overflowing

00:46.380 --> 00:48.007
- With all the fish
- you forgot to feed.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.550
And I don't think

00:49.551 --> 00:51.051
we can flush a bunny.

and a head tilt.

01:00.478 --> 01:02.146

01:03.606 --> 01:05.232
- I don't stand
- a chance, do I?

01:05.274 --> 01:06.881
Nope. Give in

01:06.882 --> 01:08.486
or I'll close

01:05.274 --> 01:08.486
with a lip quiver

01:09.695 --> 01:11.405
and a single tear.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.993
Fine. I give.

the Super Bowl

03:28.709 --> 03:30.878
was what

03:30.920 --> 03:32.546
- Bertram ate
- soup out of.

05:36.109 --> 05:37.379
this hard to believe,

- prefer their pets

Dang this phone!

07:43.797 --> 07:44.798
Who's that?

07:47.759 --> 07:49.136
(CHUCKLES)

07:49.137 --> 07:50.512
Oh, hey, Brett.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.806
Luke? What's going on?

07:52.848 --> 07:53.912
Yeah, Luke,

07:53.913 --> 07:54.975
what is going on?

07:55.017 --> 07:56.560
Really, Emma?

07:56.601 --> 07:58.229
- You wanna play
- that game?

07:59.313 --> 08:01.481
Oh, okay.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.691
Brett,

08:02.692 --> 08:03.859
the truth is,

08:03.901 --> 08:05.152
- I wanted you
- to like me,

08:05.194 --> 08:06.362
So I pretended

08:06.363 --> 08:07.529
to know a lot

08:05.194 --> 08:07.529
about sports.

08:07.571 --> 08:08.697
I asked Luke

08:08.698 --> 08:09.823
to tell me

08:07.571 --> 08:09.823
what to say.

08:09.865 --> 08:11.145
- I can't believe
- you did that!

08:12.451 --> 08:14.245
That's so cool!

08:14.286 --> 08:15.621
No girl's ever done

08:15.622 --> 08:16.955
anything that nice

08:14.286 --> 08:16.955
for me before.

- Jets! Yes!

08:22.920 --> 08:25.256
Ow!

08:25.297 --> 08:26.591
Dude, you gotta stay

08:26.592 --> 08:27.883
and watch the rest

08:25.297 --> 08:27.883
of the game with us.

08:27.925 --> 08:28.925
Sweet, I'm in!

08:32.304 --> 08:33.827
Luke, don't you

08:33.828 --> 08:35.349
think you're being

08:32.304 --> 08:35.349
a little rude?

08:35.390 --> 08:36.433
(SCOFFS)

08:36.434 --> 08:37.476
Right, where

08:35.390 --> 08:37.476
are my manners?

08:37.517 --> 08:38.953
- Brett, would you
- like anything to drink?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.000
I could go

08:40.001 --> 08:41.020
for a root beer.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.020
Good idea!

08:41.063 --> 08:42.063
Emma, two root beers.

08:43.441 --> 08:45.401
- And extra ice
- for my hand.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.385
Have you seen Lucy?

09:11.427 --> 09:13.137
I can't keep

09:13.138 --> 09:14.846
track of all your

09:11.427 --> 09:14.846

09:14.888 --> 09:16.828
Lucy! Short, furry,

09:16.829 --> 09:18.767

09:18.809 --> 09:20.498
Hmm. Could you

09:20.499 --> 09:22.187
be more specific?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.814
I must've left

09:23.815 --> 09:25.399
the cage open,

09:22.229 --> 09:25.399
and she escaped.

09:25.441 --> 09:27.276
- I am so
- irresponsible!

09:27.318 --> 09:28.444
No, no.

09:28.445 --> 09:29.569
You didn't

09:27.318 --> 09:29.569
lose Lucy.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.779
- You're doing
- a great job.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.907
I took Lucy

09:33.949 --> 09:36.285
to the bunny groomers.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.911
Why? She wasn't dirty.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.579
True.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.373
But, I had

09:41.374 --> 09:43.125
a coupon

09:43.167 --> 09:44.376
which was about

09:44.377 --> 09:45.585
to expire.

Yes, that's it.

- Are you sure you - don't mind playing
- A board game

09:53.969 --> 09:55.471
- Instead of
- watching football?

09:55.513 --> 09:56.848
No. I'm sure

09:56.849 --> 09:58.182
I'll love playing

10:07.984 --> 10:09.067
it's a lot

10:06.898 --> 10:09.067
like football.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.987

- a guy was cheating on me

- smelled like perfume,

- And had lipstick
- on his collar.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.647
- And was he?
- Yes.

14:56.354 --> 14:57.627
Put that $5 bill

14:57.628 --> 14:58.898
in your boot.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.132
But I have

15:02.133 --> 15:03.487
dire news.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.489
- It can wait. - We have to
- Find Lucy!

15:05.530 --> 15:07.220
I am afraid

15:07.221 --> 15:08.908
Mrs. Kipling

15:05.530 --> 15:08.908
beat us to it.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.765
I found what

15:10.766 --> 15:12.579
was left of Lucy in

15:08.950 --> 15:12.579
Mrs. Kipling's cage.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.205
(GASPS)

15:14.873 --> 15:15.999
No!

15:18.960 --> 15:20.587
- Jessie, what's
- the matter?

15:20.629 --> 15:22.214
It (STAMMERS)

15:22.215 --> 15:23.799
just occurred

15:20.629 --> 15:23.799
to me that I

15:23.841 --> 15:25.801
- should've gone
- to college.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.346
What's that ball

15:29.347 --> 15:30.722
of fluff you've

15:27.969 --> 15:30.722
got in your hand?

15:30.764 --> 15:32.974
Ravi's belly button lint.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.082
I have a very

15:36.083 --> 15:37.604
deep innie.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.773
Oh.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.554
I can't believe

15:49.555 --> 15:50.992
Mrs. Kipling ate

15:48.114 --> 15:50.992
Lucy for lunch!

15:51.034 --> 15:52.994
- Technically, - it was more
- Tea time.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.873
- Who cares what
- time it was?

15:55.914 --> 15:57.809
- The point is - Zuri's class pet
- Is halfway down

15:57.833 --> 15:59.022
A giant

15:59.023 --> 16:00.210
lizard's colon!

16:00.251 --> 16:01.316
Technically,

16:01.317 --> 16:02.379
it would only

16:00.251 --> 16:02.379
be in her...

16:02.420 --> 16:03.901
- Correct me again
- at your own risk!

16:05.215 --> 16:06.591
Got it.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.885
Stomach.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.303
- What am I
- going to do?

16:10.345 --> 16:11.451
I gave Zuri this

16:11.452 --> 16:12.556
big speech about

16:10.345 --> 16:12.556
being responsible.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.015
- And now,
- because of me,

16:14.057 --> 16:15.246
Lucy hippity-hopped

16:15.247 --> 16:16.434
into the light.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.874
Here is a wacky idea.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.271
You could tell

16:17.477 --> 16:20.271
Zuri the truth.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.439
I can't do that!

16:21.481 --> 16:22.917
- Because it would
- break her heart?

16:22.941 --> 16:24.068
Because she would

16:24.069 --> 16:25.193
break my legs!

16:25.235 --> 16:26.629
- Remember what - Zuri did to that
- Kid in the park

16:26.653 --> 16:27.946
Who lost her doll?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.322
I have never seen

16:29.364 --> 16:30.804
someone picked

16:30.805 --> 16:32.242
up by their

16:29.364 --> 16:32.242
nostrils before.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.077
It was a snot-filled horror.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.788
(SIGHS) This is

16:36.789 --> 16:38.122
all my fault.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.666
- Wait! I have
- an idea.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.251
Oh, I cannot

16:41.252 --> 16:42.794
wait to hear

16:39.708 --> 16:42.794
your great idea.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.004
All I need are

16:44.005 --> 16:45.171
some cotton balls,

16:42.836 --> 16:45.171
animal safe dye,

16:45.213 --> 16:46.214
and a new rabbit!

16:48.174 --> 16:49.927
And I continue to wait.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.992
Brett, if you

16:52.993 --> 16:54.305
wanted to watch

16:51.678 --> 16:54.305
the game with Luke,

16:54.347 --> 16:55.449
- why didn't you
- just tell me?

16:55.473 --> 16:56.951
- I didn't - want to hurt
- Your feelings.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.518
- Well, it's too
- late for that!

16:58.560 --> 17:00.144
- Emma, - I really
- Think...

17:00.186 --> 17:01.062
- Luke, I can't - believe you
- Did this to me.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.105
No, don't

17:02.106 --> 17:03.106
blame him.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.023
- I knew you wanted
- to see that movie,

17:05.066 --> 17:06.484
But I really

17:06.486 --> 17:07.903
wanted to watch

17:05.066 --> 17:07.903
the game with Luke.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.695
- It's my fault.
- I was weak!

17:10.238 --> 17:11.448
So weak.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.452
- I just can't look
- at you right now.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.976
Enough! This is

17:17.977 --> 17:19.414
all my fault!

17:19.455 --> 17:20.958
- No, Luke, don't
- blame yourself!

17:20.999 --> 17:22.396
Please, Brett,

17:22.397 --> 17:23.794
I feel cheap

17:20.999 --> 17:23.794
enough as it is.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.214
I'm sorry, Emma.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.385
- There's only
- one thing to do.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.408
Brett, I don't

17:34.409 --> 17:36.389
think we should see

17:32.427 --> 17:36.389
each other anymore.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.393
- Have I cherished
- our time together?

17:40.435 --> 17:43.688
Yes. But it's over.

17:43.730 --> 17:44.815
Luke, no!

17:44.856 --> 17:46.250
- We'll always have
- the Jets game.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.484
Luke, don't be rash!

17:47.525 --> 17:50.278
I said it's over!

17:55.325 --> 17:56.806
What the heck

17:56.807 --> 17:58.286
just happened here?

17:58.328 --> 18:00.204
I made a mistake.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.686
- I should have never - come between you
- And your boyfriend.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.001
Can you forgive me?

18:04.501 --> 18:06.169
I guess so.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.212
And the truth is,

18:08.254 --> 18:09.298
Brett and I really

18:09.299 --> 18:10.340
don't have that

18:08.254 --> 18:10.340
much in common.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.801
And I think he was

18:12.802 --> 18:15.219
only pretending

18:10.381 --> 18:15.219
to like Chick Chat.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.262
Emma! Are you

18:16.263 --> 18:17.263
saying what

18:15.261 --> 18:17.263
I think you're saying?

18:17.305 --> 18:19.182
- Yeah, I'm going
- to break up with him.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.288
He's all yours.

18:20.289 --> 18:21.351
(GASPS) Yes!

18:21.392 --> 18:23.227
- Thank you, - thank you,
- Thank you!

18:23.269 --> 18:24.647
Brett! Come back!

18:24.648 --> 18:26.023
The Rangers game

18:23.269 --> 18:26.023
is on in twenty minutes!

18:29.026 --> 18:30.131
Okay, this

18:30.132 --> 18:31.235
is gonna work.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.236
How can you be sure?

18:32.278 --> 18:33.613
- 'Cause I got
- nothing else.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.450
There, they

18:36.451 --> 18:37.826
could be twins.

18:37.868 --> 18:38.869
Zuri will never

18:38.870 --> 18:39.870
know the difference.

18:43.915 --> 18:45.209
Hey, what

18:45.210 --> 18:46.501
happened to Lucy?

18:46.543 --> 18:48.252
- Guard your
- nostrils.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.651
What, Zuri,

18:50.652 --> 18:51.923
what do you mean?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.675
- Nothing happened
- to good old Lucy.

18:53.717 --> 18:54.989
Which is

18:54.990 --> 18:56.260
this little

18:53.717 --> 18:56.260
gal right here.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.679
Lucy, the bunny.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.016
She looks different.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.330
And her nose

19:02.331 --> 19:03.601
is twitching

19:01.058 --> 19:03.601
a lot slower.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.728
No, it's not.

19:04.729 --> 19:05.812
(CHUCKLES)

19:10.316 --> 19:11.797
Jessie, why are

19:11.798 --> 19:13.277
you twitching

19:10.316 --> 19:13.277
her nose?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.821
It's just a little game

19:14.822 --> 19:16.322
we play, see?

19:18.408 --> 19:19.534
Fun!

19:21.828 --> 19:24.164
Okay, I think Lucy

19:24.165 --> 19:26.499
and I will just

19:21.828 --> 19:26.499
head upstairs.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.022
And not because

19:28.023 --> 19:29.502
you're freaking

19:26.541 --> 19:29.502
me out at all.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.402
You can stop

19:33.403 --> 19:34.507
playing with

19:32.296 --> 19:34.507
my nose now.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.490
Sorry. See, I told

19:38.491 --> 19:40.471
you she'd believe

19:36.509 --> 19:40.471
that's her bunny!

19:40.513 --> 19:44.101
This is not my bunny.

19:44.142 --> 19:46.061
- What makes
- you think that?

19:46.103 --> 19:47.478
- Her spots
- are coming off,

19:47.520 --> 19:48.876
And she smells

19:48.877 --> 19:50.231
like Mom after

19:47.520 --> 19:50.231
a hair appointment.

19:51.942 --> 19:53.819
Because, I gave Lucy

19:53.820 --> 19:55.695
some low lights.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.197
It really minimizes

19:57.198 --> 19:58.656
those ears.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.283
Where is Lucy?

20:00.324 --> 20:02.326
Okay, the truth is

20:03.120 --> 20:05.371
I lost Lucy.
