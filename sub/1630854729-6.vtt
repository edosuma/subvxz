09:52.417 --> 09:54.594
that will find Malcolm FX guilty
of anything

09:54.637 --> 09:56.247
except speaking the truth.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.598
-And they got a better
banner than you.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.863
-Look, you seem like
a nice magician,

10:02.906 --> 10:06.083
but you're a cog
in a broken system.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.651
-There is a lot of passion
here, which I love.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.959
-Day or night,
court's not right!

10:12.002 --> 10:14.657
Day or night, court's not right!

10:14.701 --> 10:16.224
-Don't love that.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.008
Neil, can you clear the court
out, please?

10:18.052 --> 10:19.923
And, um, everyone else,
can I talk to you

10:19.967 --> 10:21.621
out in the hall,
where there's less chants?

10:21.664 --> 10:23.231
-Less "chance" of what?!

10:23.274 --> 10:24.667
-No, less chants!

10:24.711 --> 10:25.886
-There's no chance
we're gonna hear you

10:25.929 --> 10:26.974
over all these chants!

10:27.017 --> 10:28.236
Let's go out in the hall!

10:28.279 --> 10:31.413
-Day or night,
court's not right!

10:31.456 --> 10:34.068
Day or night, court's not right!

10:34.111 --> 10:36.287
-What is going on in there?
-Okay, look, this is my fault.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.985
I should have --
-It's not your fault.

10:38.028 --> 10:39.682
Dan's the one who got them
all riled up, talking about

10:39.726 --> 10:41.423
the First Amendment
for his little fan club.

10:41.466 --> 10:43.686
-I was just making a passionate
defense for my client.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.645
The fact that it turned
a roomful of children

10:45.688 --> 10:48.517
against you is just a fun bonus.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.259
-No, a fun bonus is
when you're watching

10:51.302 --> 10:52.390
"Live with Kelly and Ryan"

10:52.434 --> 10:53.435
but Ryan Seacrest
has the day off,

10:53.478 --> 10:55.089
so Kelly's husband fills in

10:55.132 --> 10:58.875
and you get to see their
sexual tension for a full hour.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.269
-Maybe some disillusionment
is a good thing.

11:01.312 --> 11:04.533
Now Claire doesn't go into law
and we all sleep easier.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.668
Claire, my little
justice nemesis.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.931
How do not know Claire?
She's trying to destroy me!

11:12.497 --> 11:14.282
-I think y'all
are missing the point.

11:14.325 --> 11:16.458
When Xavier came to me and told
me what they were going to do --

11:16.501 --> 11:18.199
-Wait, you knew they were
going to do this?

11:18.242 --> 11:21.637
-Well, I only found out --
-Why didn't you tell me?

11:21.681 --> 11:24.771
-If I'm being honest, I can see
where the kids are coming from.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.511
-Oh, that's great,
so you can talk to them.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.687
You can get them to calm down.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.429
-You know what?
Yeah, I got this.

11:31.473 --> 11:34.563
-Day or night,
court's not right!

11:34.606 --> 11:37.261
Day or night, court's not right!

11:37.305 --> 11:40.047
-Xavier Lawrence.
-Yeah?

11:40.090 --> 11:41.701
-You got room for one more?

11:47.445 --> 11:50.231
-Sorry, I grabbed
my science homework by mistake.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.542
-Gurgs, what are
you doing?

11:57.586 --> 11:58.979
-I'm supporting my nephew.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.502
-Hey, Max,
I know it's not the best time,

12:00.545 --> 12:02.373
but I'm getting the three dots.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.988
-I got 70 cases tonight, Gurgs,
and we already started late

12:08.031 --> 12:09.163
'cause I did that magic show.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.384
You know I'm obligated
to report this.

12:13.428 --> 12:17.084
-I do know protocol.
-Well, then, help me out.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.564
I hear you,
but you could lose your job.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.001
Are you sure about this?

12:23.090 --> 12:26.136
-When I say "all rise,"
you say "get wise."

12:26.180 --> 12:27.747
All rise!
-Get wise!

12:27.790 --> 12:29.705
-All rise!
-Get wise!

12:29.749 --> 12:31.011
-All rise!
-Get wise!

12:31.054 --> 12:32.403
-All rise!
-Get wise!

12:32.447 --> 12:34.579
-Claire is clearly
the weakest chanter.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.146
-Get wise!

12:38.366 --> 12:40.194
-Neil, they're trespassers
in my courtroom,

12:40.237 --> 12:42.849
which means we have no choice
but to report them.

12:42.892 --> 12:46.678
So can you report them?
-I don't want to do that.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.985
-Neither do I.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.552
-Here's a good rule of thumb.

12:50.595 --> 12:52.119
If you're too scared
to do something,

12:52.162 --> 12:54.121
I'm definitely too scared
to do it.

12:56.123 --> 12:59.953
-Okay, I'm here as a liaison
with a list of demands.

12:59.996 --> 13:03.695
"We the protesters will not be
silenced until we receive,"

13:03.739 --> 13:06.307
uh, all of these.

13:06.350 --> 13:10.093
-The children demand a bottle
of Macallan single malt scotch?

13:10.137 --> 13:14.271
-Oh, yes, and they insist
on the 18-year, not the 12.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.405
These kids have taste.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.059
-How can you just treat this
like a joke?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.843
-Of the things that I have seen
in this court,

13:20.887 --> 13:22.279
this doesn't even
break the top 20.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.368
There are no bombs,
there are no hostages,

13:24.412 --> 13:26.675
no disgruntled warlocks.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.808
This is a snooze.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.420
-Oh, Gurgs, thank God.
Is the protest over?

13:32.463 --> 13:33.769
-No, I'm here with our demands.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.772
-Uh, uh, what are you
talking about?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.730
I just brought our demands.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.038
Alright, fine.

13:42.082 --> 13:45.389
These are for me, but my
happiness is important to them.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.263
-Neil, you're missing it.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.960
They started a chant about you.

13:51.004 --> 13:53.789
"Clerks are jerks!"

13:53.833 --> 13:55.312
-I got bigger problems
out here.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.705
I sent the nurse a selfie

13:56.748 --> 13:58.533
and she saw all the kids
in the background.

13:58.576 --> 14:00.883
Now she thinks they're my kids.
-What? Why would she think that?

14:00.927 --> 14:03.277
-I told her they were my kids.

14:03.320 --> 14:04.844
I didn't know what to do.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.976
My Justice Buddy wasn't around,
so I panicked.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.543
-Sorry that a 12-year-old

14:08.586 --> 14:10.458
dropped the ball
on your love life.

14:10.501 --> 14:14.331
Well, this little protest
really worked out well for me.

14:14.375 --> 14:18.640
I got some photos of that little
queen bee agitator, Claire.

14:18.683 --> 14:21.469
She will never work in a D.A.'s
office after they see this.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.341
Oh, it is a career killer!

14:24.385 --> 14:26.387
-You do know we're talking
about a child?

14:26.430 --> 14:27.823
She doesn't have a career.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.520
-Yeah, and I intend
to keep it that way.

14:30.521 --> 14:32.567
-They would also like
a complete overhaul

14:32.610 --> 14:33.960
of the judicial system,

14:34.003 --> 14:36.266
the abolishment
of the Electoral College,

14:36.310 --> 14:40.227
and a large cheese pizza with
Doritos baked into the crust.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.664
-Some of those
are really tricky.

14:42.707 --> 14:44.709
I don't know how I'm going
to do that pizza thing.

14:44.753 --> 14:48.322
Can we just end this?
I'm not anti-protest.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.019
I went to
all the women's marches,

14:50.063 --> 14:52.021
and the march I thought
was against ageism

14:52.065 --> 14:54.632
but turned out to be
a casino bus that broke down.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.331
-None of those grandmas knew
how to change a tire?

14:57.374 --> 14:59.420
Greatest generation, my butt!

15:01.335 --> 15:03.206
-I know firsthand
how this system fails,

15:03.250 --> 15:05.556
and you know I try really hard
to make things better,

15:05.600 --> 15:06.949
but they are blaming me
for something

15:06.993 --> 15:08.037
that I can't do anything about.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.778
It's just unfair.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.957
-That's not a good feeling,
right?

15:15.001 --> 15:16.611
When things are unfair
and there's nothing

15:16.654 --> 15:18.221
you can do about it.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.875
Makes you want to --
I don't know --

15:19.919 --> 15:23.966
pick up a sign
and yell or something.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.274
I like working here.
I like working with you.

15:27.317 --> 15:28.840
But there are cases
that come through here

15:28.884 --> 15:30.320
that just get under my skin.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.801
Most nights, I can push past it.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.455
Tonight was different.

15:38.372 --> 15:39.808
-Alright, so, I've talked
the kids down

15:39.851 --> 15:41.549
to something more reasonable.

15:41.592 --> 15:44.726
They want to have a weekly
luncheon with me at The Palm.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.598
No budgetary restrictions.

15:47.642 --> 15:48.860
Oh, yeah,
and they'll be in school

15:48.904 --> 15:51.776
so they won't be able to attend.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.865
-You know,
I just realized something.

15:53.909 --> 15:57.391
I'm the bad guy
in this situation.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.001
-Must be hard for you.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.655
I mean, I've been the good guy
for like 45 minutes,

16:00.698 --> 16:03.353
and it's pretty intoxicating.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.790
Don't know if I'll ever
be able to go back.

16:05.834 --> 16:08.228
-You're using children
to scam booze.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.317
I'm pretty sure
you'll be able to go back.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.929
-Look, you said yourself that
you're part of a system

16:13.973 --> 16:15.626
that doesn't always
get it right,

16:15.670 --> 16:19.239
which means that sometimes
you're gonna be the bad guy.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.849
You know what?
I'm -- I'm gonna tell you

16:20.892 --> 16:22.590
something that's gonna be
difficult for you to hear,

16:22.633 --> 16:24.940
but I know from experience.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.594
This isn't about you, Dan.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.078
Sorry, I've just never heard
that sentence

16:32.121 --> 16:34.167
without the word "Dan"
at the end of it.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.649
-So I guess I got to figure out
a way to make it about them.

16:38.693 --> 16:41.217
-Or we could just shut
this whole place down

16:41.261 --> 16:42.653
and I would never
have to come back.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.786
-You know, a real good guy
would help me.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.048
-Yeah, okay.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.615
Tell you what --
Let's go get a table

16:47.658 --> 16:49.095
at The Palm and figure this out.

16:56.363 --> 17:00.149
-What you got there, hmm?
A little celebratory cola?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.456
Feeling pretty good
about yourself, huh?

17:02.499 --> 17:05.720
Well, you should know stunts
like this can really hurt

17:05.762 --> 17:07.809
your chances with law school
and future employers.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.290
-Are you blackmailing me?

17:11.638 --> 17:13.902
-Should I be?

17:13.944 --> 17:17.123
-Please, I could spin
those pics like a C.D. player --

17:17.165 --> 17:18.515
an obsolete device
you may remember

17:18.559 --> 17:19.690
from your teenage years.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.910
-[ Gasps ]

17:21.953 --> 17:23.738
Okay.

17:23.781 --> 17:26.219
You're young and you, uh, think
you got it all figured out,

17:26.262 --> 17:28.089
but pretty soon
you're going to wake up

17:28.134 --> 17:30.092
to a closet full
of Ann Taylor Loft,

17:30.136 --> 17:32.964
an infestation of roaches
that you call water bugs,

17:33.008 --> 17:34.749
and a therapist who won't
return your phone calls

17:34.792 --> 17:37.578
because her therapist identified
you as clinically unhelpable!

17:39.928 --> 17:42.496
-You're right.
I don't have it all figured out.

17:42.539 --> 17:44.454
I act like I do
because I'm scared

17:44.498 --> 17:47.544
and I lash out at people
to make myself feel better.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.894
I'm a fake.

17:54.551 --> 17:57.424
-I'm an adult woman who felt
threatened by a 13-year-old.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.950
And that monologue was about me.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.522
-So, are you really going
to lose your job over this?

18:08.565 --> 18:10.915
-Probably.
-Good.

18:10.959 --> 18:14.136
Why do you want to work
in a place like this anyway?

18:14.180 --> 18:15.572
-I've asked myself
that question a lot

18:15.616 --> 18:17.139
these last couple years.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.576
Why do I keep putting
on this uniform?

18:21.274 --> 18:23.232
I think being here is important.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.495
I want the people who come
to court to see

18:25.539 --> 18:28.542
someone from their community,
someone who understands them

18:28.585 --> 18:30.848
and who doesn't just assume
they're guilty.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.938
I mean,
sometimes they are very guilty.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.551
But they still deserve to be
treated like human beings,

18:37.594 --> 18:38.813
and that's what I do.

18:40.641 --> 18:42.643
-Maybe it's good to have
people like you here.

18:44.253 --> 18:46.342
I hope you don't lose your job.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.910
-Well, if I do, I'll just
get a job at your school.

18:48.953 --> 18:51.478
[ Laughs ] If you think you were
embarrassed today,

18:51.521 --> 18:53.219
strap in, baby!

18:56.222 --> 18:59.921
-Alright, no more being
Judge Mr. Nice Judge!

18:59.964 --> 19:03.620
I'm charging you all
with criminal trespassing!

19:05.405 --> 19:06.971
Technically Olivia
is charging you,

19:07.015 --> 19:11.150
so really she's the worst,
but I'm still plenty bad!

19:11.193 --> 19:14.675
-Just a second,
you tiny monster!

19:14.718 --> 19:17.112
-Ah, it's Mr. Fielding
for the defense.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.159
-That's right, and I have
secured an emergency permit

19:20.202 --> 19:24.685
to allow these young people
to assemble.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.340
-Damn it, you found a way
to let these dissenting voices

19:27.383 --> 19:29.429
be heard
by working within the system.

19:29.472 --> 19:32.040
You and these fresh-faced
future lawyers and judges

19:32.083 --> 19:34.695
have foiled me yet again!

19:36.044 --> 19:39.047
-Is this a play?

19:39.090 --> 19:40.962
-It's boring like a play.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.575
-No, it's very funny
and suspicious

19:45.619 --> 19:48.143
that you're against us
when your signature is on it.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.319
-Is it? Wow.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.627
I sign so many things
'cause, you know, cog.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.282
-Uh-huh.

19:56.325 --> 20:00.590
Well, thanks, but our protest
is over anyway.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.637
This place needs a lot of work.

20:03.680 --> 20:07.554
But I feel better knowing there
are people here who get it.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.251
-Me too.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.777
-So, this means I get to go

20:13.821 --> 20:17.651
to your school's
auntie-nephew dance.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.436
-Uh, we don't have one of tho--
-Shh!

20:22.482 --> 20:24.223
Let her have this.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.184
-There, I fixed it for you.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.577
She said she'll see you
next weekend

20:30.620 --> 20:32.970
when your kids are
with your ex in Hartford.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.972
-Wow, you're good.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.844
You know, this whole night,
I thought I was teaching you,

20:36.887 --> 20:39.281
but in a way,
you were teaching me.

20:39.325 --> 20:41.979
-In every way
I was teaching you.

20:42.023 --> 20:43.720
At no point
were you teaching me.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.074
-Goodbye, Aunt Gurgs.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.728
See you at Sunday bun day?

20:51.772 --> 20:54.731
-Thanks again for the invite.
I can't wait.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.995
It's going to be
a "bunnn-ch" of fun.

20:58.039 --> 21:01.390
-It's called bun day,
not pun day.

21:01.434 --> 21:04.785
-Before I go, I just want
to let you know

21:04.828 --> 21:05.916
how much this meant to me.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.309
-Oh!

21:07.353 --> 21:09.485
This generation
and your incessant need

21:09.529 --> 21:11.400
to express every feeling.

21:11.444 --> 21:14.273
J-Just get out of here
before I take more

21:14.316 --> 21:16.100
of your birthday money.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.842
You know what?

21:18.886 --> 21:20.540
This turned out to be
a lot of fun.
