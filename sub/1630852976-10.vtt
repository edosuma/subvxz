WEBVTT

00:07.050 --> 00:09.966
Previously on
Star Picard...

00:10.010 --> 00:12.273
After all this time,
I've come to wonder,

00:12.316 --> 00:15.232
have you been seeking
or running?

00:15.276 --> 00:18.018
There is no more time.

00:18.061 --> 00:20.411
We will offer our queen.

00:21.673 --> 00:24.241
Activate auto-destruct sequence.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.462
What is this hellhole, Q?

00:27.505 --> 00:29.942
This is not a lesson.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.596
It's a penance.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.424
-Or?
-Forgiveness.

00:33.468 --> 00:34.512
Forgiveness for what?

00:34.556 --> 00:36.384
I think you know.

00:36.427 --> 00:39.256
We have to repair the past.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.780
-If we fail here,

00:41.824 --> 00:43.391
we fail Elnor.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.088
You're not Laris.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.350
My name is Tallinn.

00:46.394 --> 00:48.091
I have devoted my entire being

00:48.135 --> 00:50.528
to protecting one individual.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.226
I watch, but I'm never seen.

00:52.269 --> 00:54.141
I've never met Renée.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.534
So no Europa mission, no hope.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.884
Everyone hates everyone.

00:58.928 --> 01:01.148
We just need to make sure
Renée gets on that ship.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.889
I'm sorry the others
didn't make it.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.283
Looks like you were
the strongest of the bunch.

01:06.327 --> 01:07.893
Am I an experiment?

01:07.937 --> 01:09.591
If I walk out that door
right now,

01:09.634 --> 01:11.810
what are you afraid of losing?

01:11.854 --> 01:14.639
Renée Picard either boards a
spaceship and makes a discovery

01:14.683 --> 01:16.946
that renders
your work obsolete or...

01:16.989 --> 01:20.993
Earth in your time finds itself
in ecological freefall.

01:21.037 --> 01:24.432
The man they turn to is you.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.303
If only you're given
the opportunity.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.566
I can get us
into Mission Control.

01:28.610 --> 01:31.134
There's a man who will
stand in your way

01:31.178 --> 01:33.049
as he now stands in mine.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.485
Picard!

01:34.529 --> 01:35.921
You have no idea

01:35.965 --> 01:38.010
what this is like
for me, do you?

01:38.054 --> 01:40.404
Knowing win or lose,
I'll have to let them go.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.668
Let me out, Jean-Luc.

01:43.712 --> 01:48.064
This skeleton key migrated
all over the house.

01:48.108 --> 01:52.155
I wish, that day,
it hadn't ended up in my hand.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.417
A deal must be honored.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.290
A ship for a life.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.074
To succeed,
there must be two Renées:

01:58.118 --> 02:00.772
one who lives
and another who dies.

02:00.816 --> 02:04.863
I refuse to accept an outcome
that has not yet occurred.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.169
We have work to do.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.432
We must ensure
the Europa Mission

02:08.476 --> 02:10.130
takes off as planned.

02:17.485 --> 02:20.009
I remember family stories

02:20.052 --> 02:23.665
of how the château got shot up

02:23.708 --> 02:26.146
when my ancestors
were reoccupying it

02:26.189 --> 02:27.886
in the 21st century.

02:27.930 --> 02:31.151
These are the same bullet holes.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.241
Do you think that means we're
on the path to the right future?

02:34.284 --> 02:36.678
I'm not certain.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.854
I keep turning it over
in my head.

02:38.897 --> 02:41.335
That prophecy Agnes said.

02:41.378 --> 02:44.947
To succeed,
there need to be two Renées:

02:44.990 --> 02:48.298
one who lives
and another who dies.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.131
What does that mean?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.394
How-how is that even possible?

03:00.702 --> 03:02.312
Picard, later.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.055
We all set?

03:17.371 --> 03:18.502
Impressive.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.288
These should work
a lot like your tricorders.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.942
-Raffi, can you tag Soong's GPS?
-On it.

03:23.986 --> 03:26.423
His entire fleet of vehicles
is still at his house.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.425
Jurati jacked into
our transporters from there.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.253
He must have massive
remote capabilities.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.037
So that's where we head.

03:32.081 --> 03:34.388
Tallinn, you can just walk
into quarantine?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.041
They break quarantine
on launch day,

03:36.085 --> 03:38.479
but I'm going to transport in
to avoid security

03:38.522 --> 03:40.481
and the bio-scanners
in the front lobby.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.091
-Transport in?
-Don't worry.

03:42.134 --> 03:43.919
I've been planning this
for a long time.

03:43.962 --> 03:45.573
Well, what do you intend to do?

03:45.616 --> 03:48.402
I'm going to watch out for her,
Picard.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.317
It's what I do.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.971
-- Good luck.
-- You, too.

04:00.675 --> 04:02.938
What the hell is he doing?

06:03.058 --> 06:04.451
Preparing for CAPCOM status.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.148
All systems report out.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.260
MAN
T minus 21 minutes until launch.

06:31.303 --> 06:33.044
What are you doing?

06:33.088 --> 06:35.177
More to the point,
I know what you are doing

06:35.220 --> 06:37.135
or what you intend to do.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.748
-Tallinn.
-Get back.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.489
I'm so sorry,
but I can't let you do this.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.621
What? My job?

06:44.665 --> 06:47.319
You do not have to sacrifice
your life to save hers.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.193
Okay.

06:51.236 --> 06:53.108
Did Jurati have any reason
to lie to you?

06:53.151 --> 06:55.110
Thousands. She's part Borg.

06:55.153 --> 06:56.981
But she was more Agnes.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.983
More your friend.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.856
With a view of the future,
of all possible futures.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.814
I don't rely on prophecy.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.469
And even if I did,
there are so many different ways

07:06.513 --> 07:08.079
to interpret what she said.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.386
And because you think
you know what she meant,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.475
I won't let you
sacrifice yourself...

07:12.519 --> 07:13.998
You won't let me?

07:14.999 --> 07:16.174
It's not up to you.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.089
This is my life.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.483
You don't get to stop me
from fulfilling my purpose

07:20.527 --> 07:22.920
because you're scared
I'm gonna die.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.836
My fate is not yours to decide.

07:31.276 --> 07:32.843
I understand.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.976
I've seen the heart of this
in you.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.500
But other people's lives
aren't up to you.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.503
And their deaths
aren't your fault.

07:40.547 --> 07:43.288
Not mine if it comes.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.029
Not your mother's.

07:45.073 --> 07:48.250
That's a fantasy, Jean-Luc.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.731
We can't control who we lose.

07:50.774 --> 07:53.690
And we can't spare ourselves
the pain of it.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.650
But people's choices
are their own to make,

07:56.693 --> 07:59.740
and this one is mine.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.488
I don't need saving.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.315
I never have.

08:15.886 --> 08:19.411
Computer, recalibrate
orbital eccentricities.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.327
Synchronize drone
targeting systems

08:22.371 --> 08:24.112
on the shuttle's RCS thrusters.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.157
Flight path analyzed.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.725
Sectors six through 12
clear for launch.

08:28.769 --> 08:31.206
Computer, time
till drone launch.

08:31.249 --> 08:35.558
Four minutes, 27 seconds.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.473
Adjust flight telemetry to...

08:38.996 --> 08:40.955
Shit.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.218
Picard, do you copy?
We were wrong.

08:43.261 --> 08:44.654
Dr. Soong?

08:44.698 --> 08:46.482
Soong is not here.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.007
That's because he's here
at the launch.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.575
Goddamn it!

08:52.619 --> 08:54.403
This entire bullshit scenario
was designed

08:54.446 --> 08:56.405
to draw us here
and away from Soong.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.625
What if his voice is fake but...

08:58.668 --> 09:00.278
the drones aren't?

09:00.322 --> 09:04.021
I've got four heat signatures...

09:04.065 --> 09:06.110
behind here.

09:12.726 --> 09:14.684
Whatever he's doing
at the launch,

09:14.728 --> 09:16.686
I think we found
his backup plan.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.821
If he can't stop Renée
from boarding,

09:20.864 --> 09:23.214
he's gonna use the drones
to take out the rocket itself.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.868
Raffi, how much time do we have?

09:24.912 --> 09:27.392
Uh, three minutes, 45 seconds.

09:27.436 --> 09:30.004
-Can you get remote access?
-System's encrypted.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.832
If I had La Sirena,
I could crack it,

09:31.875 --> 09:34.617
but without it,
I can't stop them.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.751
WOMAN
Hydraulic instrument power
is a go.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.108
MAN
Clear launchpad of all
nonessential personnel.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.588
How about we cripple them?

09:48.631 --> 09:49.763
Can't hit the shuttle
if they can't fly.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.155
Soong knew we would find this.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.680
Right? Why bother
creating a recording?

09:53.723 --> 09:56.334
He calculated that we would try
to destroy them.

09:56.378 --> 09:57.640
Here, it's...

09:57.684 --> 09:59.642
Damn it.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.296
He hardwired them to explode.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.907
We even tap it wrong,
we all go boom.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.388
So, what are you saying?
That's it?

10:06.431 --> 10:08.520
Hell no. I need tools.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.566
Pliers, scissors, whatever
you can get your hands on.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.873
We might not be able
to disable them,

10:12.916 --> 10:15.223
but maybe I can gain
manual control.

10:26.451 --> 10:27.801
MAN
You're clear to do that.

10:27.844 --> 10:29.063
Strip 1-A is now closed.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.108
We are in lockdown...

10:31.152 --> 10:32.936
Dr. Soong, we weren't
expecting you.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.286
We would have prepared
a VIP booth.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.593
Nonsense. I'm not the VIP today.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.769
I just want a few minutes
with the astronauts.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.379
Shake hands
with the men and women

10:41.423 --> 10:42.903
who are about to create
the future.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.687
Well, with all
the quarantine protocol...

10:44.731 --> 10:46.602
I'm sorry?

10:46.646 --> 10:50.519
Did my donations not buy me
five minutes of face time?

10:50.562 --> 10:52.521
Of course.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.566
They're preparing to suit up.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.916
All right.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.977
Oh, God.

11:14.021 --> 11:15.762
It's happening.

11:17.502 --> 11:20.201
And I'm actually ready.

11:20.244 --> 11:24.161
WOMAN
Europa Mission launch commencing
in T minus 60 minutes.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.165
Who are you?

11:28.209 --> 11:29.297
Where's Maya?

11:30.298 --> 11:31.865
Maya wasn't feeling well.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.476
No one wanted to take
any chances, so...

11:34.519 --> 11:35.956
Bullshit.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.567
I know every person
on every suit-up crew.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.569
You're not on any of them.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.485
Why are you wearing
Maya's uniform?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.581
I can't believe it's here.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.801
The day. History.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.498
I never would have thought
we'd make it.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.282
You didn't?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.415
What a terrible attitude.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.678
I-I guess what I mean
is that, uh,

12:02.722 --> 12:04.985
it-it didn't seem like
it would ever be real.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.987
Yeah, you really are
disrespectful.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.164
I'd like to leave you
right here.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.382
Oh...

12:12.427 --> 12:14.211
I will leave you right here.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.041
Who are you?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.305
I've seen you before.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.438
Somewhere.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.831
Renée, I need you
to listen to me,

12:24.874 --> 12:26.876
or your life will be
in grave danger.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.229
When you were a little girl,

12:32.273 --> 12:33.796
at your mother's funeral,

12:33.840 --> 12:36.930
you put a small spaceship
figurine into her casket

12:36.973 --> 12:39.323
because still, to this day,

12:39.367 --> 12:42.718
you think that if you fly out
far enough you'll find her.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.428
You do know me.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.868
I tried to hide it,
but there were times I couldn't.

13:15.925 --> 13:19.276
I gave this to you
a long time ago.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.454
That time your little sailboat
capsized off Martha's Vineyard.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.152
You remember?

13:26.936 --> 13:29.417
What were you, ten?

13:31.506 --> 13:34.944
Two nights ago at the gala,
a dozen other glimpses.

13:36.163 --> 13:38.905
Maybe I couldn't help it.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.950
That's what I tell myself.

13:42.517 --> 13:46.390
But the truth is a part of me
wanted you to see me.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.828
To know I was there.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.615
You've always said you had
a guardian angel,

13:53.658 --> 13:55.399
and you were right.

13:55.443 --> 13:58.011
Well, not the angel part.

13:58.054 --> 14:00.143
It's...

14:00.187 --> 14:01.841
me.

14:04.626 --> 14:05.975
How about now?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.629
No signal.
Maybe we can bypass...

14:07.672 --> 14:09.631
Drone uplink complete.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.067
Primary activation initiated.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.460
Whoa, whoa.

14:12.503 --> 14:14.505
-We're too late.

14:14.549 --> 14:17.030
He staggered the launches so we
can't stop them all at once.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.731
Raffi, can you get me
manual control?

14:22.774 --> 14:25.647
Uh, maybe, but I'll need
to hardwire its subroutines.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.607
Raffi, whatever you're doing,
do it faster.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.740
I just need more time
to override the system.

14:41.097 --> 14:45.623
Renée, all I want to do
is get you on that ship.

14:45.667 --> 14:49.105
I have a hunch, and I'm not sure
if I'm right, but...

14:49.149 --> 14:53.327
right now your life depends
on trusting me.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.287
Can you do that?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.551
Please.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.343
Mr. Soong, thank God.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.388
There's a crazy woman. She says
she's my guardian from space.

15:11.432 --> 15:13.825
-She...
-It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.089
I'll call someone. Come with me.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.831
Goddamn Soong.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.881
Holy shit.
I've got full control.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.018
Rios, take those
other drones out.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.761
The suit-up room.
Get up there now.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.896
-Wh-What did you...
-Don't worry.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.202
Won't last long.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.901
This neurotoxin...

15:45.945 --> 15:47.598
is fast.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.037
-And fatal.

15:51.080 --> 15:55.128
Looks like you're about
to create the future after all.

15:59.828 --> 16:01.264
MAN
Transfer ignition.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.918
Go internal power.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.270
Come on, Rios.

16:07.314 --> 16:09.359
These analog controls
aren't helping.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.499
Picard.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.109
Come on, come on.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.341
Ha!

16:34.384 --> 16:36.082
All drones terminated.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.084
Strike sequence canceled.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.006
You must have something
that would help-- med tech.

16:47.049 --> 16:49.051
It's too late, Jean-Luc.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.792
We both know.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.231
I need to see.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.016
Oh, come.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.984
Look up.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.294
Look up.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.955
You're off.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.915
Tallinn...

17:28.873 --> 17:30.875
I know something now.

17:32.529 --> 17:34.401
The secrets we keep.

17:34.444 --> 17:38.274
All the reasons we never
tell someone we love them.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.276
They're worthless.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.887
Tallinn...

17:42.931 --> 17:44.976
I'm so sorry.

17:45.020 --> 17:47.066
Sweet Picard.

17:47.109 --> 17:50.069
Your guilt must have saved
planets by now.

17:51.244 --> 17:55.509
Countless lives in trade
for the one you couldn't.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.685
I got to tell her.

17:59.034 --> 18:01.167
Maybe she'll remember me...

18:02.298 --> 18:05.301
...and know that
she was worth all of it.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.611
You helped me give that to her.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.963
Absolve yourself,

18:15.006 --> 18:18.488
or the only life left unsaved
will be your own.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.931
Her eyes...

18:26.975 --> 18:29.717
they were so beautiful.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.889
TheShango just passed
the thermosphere

19:11.933 --> 19:13.543
as we check in with

19:13.587 --> 19:15.850
Mission Specialist
Dr. Renée Picard.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.808
Renée, how's the view up there?

19:17.852 --> 19:19.680
Dynamic pressure decreasing.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.464
All systems normal.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.205
We are away.

19:23.249 --> 19:25.294
On the wings of...

19:27.253 --> 19:30.212
-...those who came before us.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.345
Europa, here we come.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.434
On behalf of all of us,

19:34.477 --> 19:37.001
to you and the entire crew,
Godspeed.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.222
"Godspeed."

20:00.460 --> 20:02.157
What?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.730
No.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.036
No, no, no, no, no.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.777
Goddamn it!

20:25.659 --> 20:27.313
Hi, Dad.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.229
Kore.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.232
Please.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.190
Wh-What did you do?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.800
Made a new future.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.325
For us both.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.675
This is for my sisters.

20:41.718 --> 20:45.679
100% file deletion confirmed.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.943
System-wide purge complete.

21:49.743 --> 21:52.354
I swear to God, if this is
another one of your games, Q...

21:52.398 --> 21:53.573
No.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.009
No, no.

21:55.052 --> 21:58.534
I can assure you
we are very different.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.623
Hello, Kore.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.365
And you are?

22:03.409 --> 22:07.195
That's a very long
and very complicated story.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.677
Honestly, I've got
nothing pressing.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.374
Okay.

22:12.418 --> 22:15.377
A long time ago,
I was known as Wesley Crusher,

22:15.421 --> 22:19.163
but now I am a traveler
of all of space and time.

22:22.645 --> 22:23.994
You're kidding, right?

22:24.038 --> 22:25.822
The last time I told a joke,

22:25.866 --> 22:28.521
I inadvertently changed
a century's worth of history,

22:28.564 --> 22:31.611
so I work really hard
to not be misunderstood.

22:32.742 --> 22:34.657
That's a lot.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.398
You have no idea.

22:36.442 --> 22:40.620
My colleagues and I, we dispatch
those we call supervisors

22:40.663 --> 22:43.274
to help ensure
the proper flow of time.

22:43.318 --> 22:48.105
So the universe is essentially
a grand tapestry.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.499
It is flawless.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.937
It is fragile. It is exquisite.

22:53.981 --> 22:58.159
Yet it is somehow always
a thread's pull away

22:58.202 --> 23:00.291
from total annihilation.

23:00.335 --> 23:03.643
A star is born,
but a ship is lost.

23:03.686 --> 23:07.690
A new species thrives,
but a civilization collapses.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.997
Knowing when to step in--

23:10.040 --> 23:12.260
that's the tricky part.

23:13.653 --> 23:18.266
And so my colleagues and I,
we watch.

23:18.309 --> 23:21.008
We protect everything.

23:22.357 --> 23:23.837
Big job.

23:23.880 --> 23:25.882
Tell me about it.

23:25.926 --> 23:28.755
Two paths are before you.

23:28.798 --> 23:32.759
The first one leads to
a perfectly normal life.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.370
Wait, is this
a recruitment speech?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.632
I'm not done.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.504
The second...

23:38.547 --> 23:41.594
that path leads
to everything else.

23:41.637 --> 23:45.641
And it offers a chance to give
your life purpose and meaning.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.080
But I cannot guarantee
your safety.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.434
Okay, that's it.
That was the recruitment speech.

24:02.310 --> 24:04.573
I've never been safe.

24:06.270 --> 24:08.577
Welcome to the Travelers.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.034
-A tricorder,

24:31.078 --> 24:32.862
a couple of comm badges,
a broken phaser.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.298
I think that's all of it.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.778
Every butterfly I could find.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.780
So we'll never know
if it worked.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.565
It did. It-it had to.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.741
Now, that's the only way
that never seeing the people

24:41.784 --> 24:43.786
we're never gonna see again
is okay.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.615
Right. We live here now.

24:46.659 --> 24:49.183
So, what do we do?
I mean, how does money work?

24:49.226 --> 24:50.750
Come to L.A.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.534
That's a bit presumptuous,
isn't it?

24:52.578 --> 24:55.798
-Suppose I should ask first.
-Hey, Chris.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.322
Look at these cool rocks
we found outside in the field.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.237
Wow.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.848
Whoa. These are, like,
really old.

25:01.891 --> 25:04.764
I've never seen Rios so happy.

25:04.807 --> 25:07.114
You really okay with this?

25:08.376 --> 25:10.378
Maybe better than okay.

25:12.467 --> 25:15.775
And hey, if you're done
running from your Borg past,

25:15.818 --> 25:17.559
I hope you won't think
all of a sudden that,

25:17.603 --> 25:19.474
"Oh, my God,
I got to stay super still

25:19.518 --> 25:21.432
and spend every waking moment
with Raffi," 'cause, you know,

25:21.476 --> 25:23.478
I-I'm actually feeling
like I-I want to,

25:23.522 --> 25:26.916
you know, focus on me
for a change.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.179
Yeah, 'cause, you know, maybe...

25:29.223 --> 25:31.399
maybe this isn't half bad
to hang out with,

25:31.442 --> 25:32.922
so if that's your...

25:44.107 --> 25:45.935
So...

25:45.979 --> 25:47.371
what does that mean?

25:47.415 --> 25:48.895
Oh, my God, Raffi.

25:48.938 --> 25:50.244
Let it breathe.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.115
-Okay, well, I just...

25:54.161 --> 25:57.556
Uh, where did JL slip off to?

26:42.775 --> 26:45.299
Bravo.

26:45.342 --> 26:47.301
Destiny.

26:47.344 --> 26:49.129
Left for the little boy

26:49.172 --> 26:51.522
you will be in the future
to find.

27:07.843 --> 27:10.237
You considered destroying it,
didn't you?

27:12.674 --> 27:14.458
Well, let me ask.

27:14.502 --> 27:17.157
If that key is not there
for the boy to find,

27:17.200 --> 27:19.202
does he grow up with his mother?

27:19.246 --> 27:22.292
Does the shame instantly lift?

27:26.557 --> 27:28.647
But you accepted your fate.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.431
You accepted you.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.521
You chose the Jean-Luc you are.

27:33.564 --> 27:36.698
You absolved yourself.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.962
And because you choose him,
perhaps he will now be

27:40.006 --> 27:42.704
worthy enough
for someone else to choose.

27:42.748 --> 27:47.883
Maybe this time, you will even
give him the chance to be loved.

27:50.843 --> 27:53.672
I told you this was
about forgiveness, Jean-Luc.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.153
Yours.

27:59.112 --> 28:00.548
Why?

28:00.591 --> 28:03.725
Well, isn't that
the eternal question?

28:03.769 --> 28:05.814
Know thyself.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.903
There's been so much loss.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.557
So much death.

28:09.600 --> 28:12.778
-But you fixed all that.
-Elnor, Tallinn.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.388
Well, maybe not all of it.

28:14.431 --> 28:16.695
But Tallinn always dies
in every timeline.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.045
This is the only one
in which she meets Renée.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.528
I ask you once again:

28:24.572 --> 28:25.921
Why?

28:25.965 --> 28:29.620
Finish the sentence.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.362
Me.

28:35.104 --> 28:38.281
From the very beginning,

28:38.325 --> 28:41.415
for over 30 years...

28:41.458 --> 28:43.243
why me?

28:46.681 --> 28:49.728
I am moving on.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.122
In your parlance, I am dying.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.297
Yes, I know.

28:54.341 --> 28:56.386
Alone.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.737
I am dying alone.

29:01.348 --> 29:04.655
I do not want that for you.

29:06.701 --> 29:10.574
Humans-- your griefs,
your pains fix you

29:10.618 --> 29:13.142
to moments in the past
long gone.

29:13.186 --> 29:16.450
You're like butterflies
with your wings pinned.

29:16.493 --> 29:20.367
My old friend, forever the boy

29:20.410 --> 29:22.673
who, with an errant turn
of a skeleton key,

29:22.717 --> 29:24.893
broke the universe
and his own heart.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.373
No more.

29:26.416 --> 29:30.333
You are now unshackled
from the past.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.901
As I leave,

29:32.945 --> 29:35.599
I leave you free.

29:36.862 --> 29:39.168
But...

29:39.212 --> 29:42.345
why does all this matter?

29:44.695 --> 29:49.309
Is something going to happen
for which I will be required?

29:49.352 --> 29:51.964
Must it always have
galactic import?

29:52.007 --> 29:55.358
Universal stakes,
celestial upheaval?

29:55.402 --> 29:57.752
Isn't one life enough?

29:57.796 --> 30:00.189
You ask me why it matters.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.626
It matters to me.

30:09.459 --> 30:13.202
You matter to me.

30:14.769 --> 30:17.293
Even gods have favorites,
Jean-Luc.

30:17.337 --> 30:19.905
And you've always been
one of mine.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.297
Q...

30:21.341 --> 30:22.690
Time's almost up.

30:22.733 --> 30:26.041
I have one last surprise
in store.

30:33.353 --> 30:35.094
What's wrong?

30:36.095 --> 30:37.792
Nothing.

30:39.315 --> 30:41.361
Quite the opposite.

30:47.454 --> 30:49.195
Well, hello.

30:49.238 --> 30:50.892
Nice to see you all.

30:50.936 --> 30:52.589
Q. Motherf...

30:52.633 --> 30:54.983
Try not to kill him
until we find out what he wants.

30:55.027 --> 30:56.463
"Try" is right.

30:56.506 --> 30:59.640
And now, as they say,
for my final act.

30:59.683 --> 31:01.685
-What about Elnor?
-Who?

31:01.729 --> 31:03.905
You killed him.

31:03.949 --> 31:07.866
Actually, it was other-her's
idiot husband, to be precise.

31:09.476 --> 31:12.131
In my weakened state,
you might be able to kill me.

31:12.174 --> 31:16.048
Certainly,
my sending you home will.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.707
Well, as you like.

31:23.751 --> 31:26.580
Now, are we all ready
to go home?

31:26.623 --> 31:27.973
Bags packed?

31:29.757 --> 31:31.280
No.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.284
I'm staying.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.677
Chris.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.332
You know you can't do that.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.856
-The timeline.
-I never fit, you know?

31:42.857 --> 31:45.077
Nothing stuck.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.122
I mean, I was living alone
in a cargo ship

31:47.166 --> 31:49.516
with five holographic
versions of myself.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.431
Not very encouraging.

31:52.954 --> 31:54.521
And then I met you.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.350
I never had a family
in any real way.

31:57.393 --> 31:58.786
You changed all that.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.353
All of you did.

32:02.311 --> 32:04.400
This is where I belong.

32:06.315 --> 32:07.969
Jean-Luc...

32:09.797 --> 32:11.364
I'm home.

32:17.326 --> 32:19.633
Make a good future.

32:23.419 --> 32:26.509
Maybe it was always supposed
to be this way.

32:26.553 --> 32:28.424
Time's a funny thing.

32:29.425 --> 32:31.166
Yes, it is.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.169
Interesting.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.693
No...

32:41.046 --> 32:43.004
I'm gonna miss you, Raf.

32:43.048 --> 32:44.919
Yeah, you are.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.837
He's a handful, you know?

32:51.056 --> 32:53.014
Piece of cake.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.277
Piece of cake.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.586
I should go 'cause...

33:13.078 --> 33:15.036
Most unexpected.

33:16.081 --> 33:18.997
Perhaps now there'll be
some surplus energy?

33:20.085 --> 33:22.348
Call it a surprise, a gift.

33:24.741 --> 33:27.744
Farewell, mon capitaine.

33:27.788 --> 33:30.356
It's time for me to go.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.532
But not alone.

33:36.144 --> 33:38.407
Isn't that the point
of all this?

33:53.118 --> 33:55.033
See you out there.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.629
The ship will detonate
in T minus...

34:28.457 --> 34:31.243
Ten, nine,

34:31.286 --> 34:35.290
eight, seven, six,

34:35.334 --> 34:39.033
five, four, three...

34:39.077 --> 34:42.297
Computer, cancel
auto-destruct sequence.

34:42.341 --> 34:45.474
Auto-destruct canceled.

34:45.518 --> 34:47.085
Stand down.

34:48.303 --> 34:49.783
Stand down!

34:49.826 --> 34:51.785
That's an order.

34:57.921 --> 35:00.315
Let her proceed.

35:05.364 --> 35:08.845
I once told a dear friend
what that song meant to me.

35:08.889 --> 35:12.632
Now, while I don't have time
to teach you the words,

35:12.675 --> 35:17.071
I believe that she has had
400 years to consider them.

35:18.072 --> 35:19.813
Haven't you, Doctor?

35:42.531 --> 35:44.577
It's good to see you, Agnes.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.321
What the hell's going on here?

35:51.061 --> 35:52.411
Jurati?

35:53.455 --> 35:55.631
I'm glad you still remember
the song

35:55.675 --> 35:57.938
that calmed me when I was a boy.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.896
We hoped it would calm you now.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.420
MAN
Stargazer, this is
Fleet Command.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.465
-Please report in.
-Admiral?

36:03.509 --> 36:05.946
I want to believe
you mean us no harm

36:05.989 --> 36:07.948
and that is why you sent
the signal.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.951
One that you knew
I would understand.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.475
That is still you in there,
isn't it?

36:13.519 --> 36:14.955
Yes.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.435
In part.

36:16.478 --> 36:18.915
But if we don't act,
many will die.

36:18.959 --> 36:21.918
This here, this now.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.485
What is the threat?

36:23.529 --> 36:25.357
Why have you assumed control
of our ships?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.923
Captain, I'm picking up

36:26.967 --> 36:28.795
a massive spike
in neutrino emissions

36:28.838 --> 36:31.363
focused on the center
of the quadrant.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.192
Where's Captain Rios?

36:34.235 --> 36:36.106
Stay on task, helm.
That's an order.

36:36.150 --> 36:38.196
Show me what you see.

36:42.896 --> 36:46.160
Uh, what the hell is that?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.683
Unclear.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.946
But if its triquantum waves
keep increasing,

36:49.990 --> 36:52.558
it's going to expel
a massive amount of energy.

36:52.601 --> 36:54.516
Enough to destroy
most of this sector.

36:55.778 --> 36:57.954
That's a galactic event.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.782
By our calculations,

36:59.826 --> 37:01.784
the only way
to protect the quadrant

37:01.828 --> 37:04.787
is to harmonize the fleet's
shields with our own.

37:04.831 --> 37:07.921
That is why we needed access
to the fleet.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.184
That's why you asked for me.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.231
You needed someone
with authority you could trust.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.233
Who would trust you.

37:15.276 --> 37:17.017
MAN
Stargazer, what is your status?

37:18.758 --> 37:20.934
We needed a friend.

37:22.718 --> 37:26.200
Stargazer, report in, or we'll
assume you've been compromised.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.593
Inform Starfleet we are in

37:27.636 --> 37:29.159
active negotiations
with the Borg.

37:29.203 --> 37:31.640
Otherwise, they're gonna
blow us out of the sky.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.773
Considering you know more
about the Borg

37:33.816 --> 37:36.166
than anyone else
on the ship, Seven,

37:36.210 --> 37:40.301
by my authority, consider this
a field commission.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.136
Hail the fleet.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.181
The admiral has authorized
full control by the Borg Queen.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.835
Tell them do not resist.

37:54.097 --> 37:56.535
Agnes, be brilliant.

37:57.536 --> 37:58.754
Always.

37:58.798 --> 38:00.887
Initiating grid formation.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.559
We are out of time.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.256
Then let's hope that this works.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.737
Harmonizing
your fleet's shields.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.376
Excelsior'sharmonics are off.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.726
Excelsior, your shield emitter
needs to be recalibrated.

38:57.770 --> 38:58.945
Do you copy?

38:59.946 --> 39:01.904
We copy. Realigning now and...

39:01.948 --> 39:03.297
Raffi?

39:04.298 --> 39:06.648
Elnor?

39:06.692 --> 39:09.825
The last thing I remember,
I was onLa Sirena.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.784
Make the adjustment, cadet.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.615
Q.

39:16.658 --> 39:17.964
Goddamned Q.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.269
What did he call it?

39:19.313 --> 39:21.271
"A surprise, a gift."

39:22.838 --> 39:24.492
That thing is about to blow.

39:24.536 --> 39:25.928
Brace for impact.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.514
Shields holding.
I think it worked.

40:34.388 --> 40:38.174
You just saved
billions of lives.

40:40.394 --> 40:42.875
That was the idea... mister.

40:44.050 --> 40:46.705
Guys, you seeing this?

40:47.923 --> 40:49.490
What is it?

40:49.534 --> 40:51.405
I believe we have just witnessed

40:51.449 --> 40:53.538
the creation
of a transwarp conduit,

40:53.581 --> 40:56.279
but unlike any
I've ever seen before.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.064
Uh, created by whom?

40:58.107 --> 40:59.500
Even with our
collective knowledge,

40:59.544 --> 41:02.285
the answer remains elusive.

41:02.329 --> 41:04.984
But you know more.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.768
What you see is a piece

41:06.812 --> 41:09.162
of the puzzle
whose final image is unclear

41:09.205 --> 41:11.207
but is tied to a threat.

41:11.251 --> 41:14.167
One which requires
close observation.

41:14.210 --> 41:16.865
We request provisional
membership in the Federation

41:16.909 --> 41:20.695
so that we may remain here,
a guardian at the gates.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.356
Thank you, Agnes.

41:41.150 --> 41:43.370
I'm sorry I couldn't
tell you sooner.

41:43.413 --> 41:46.068
I just knew that
if I guided you right,

41:46.112 --> 41:49.028
set you straight,
you'd circle around eventually.

41:49.071 --> 41:51.944
And I also want to thank you

41:51.987 --> 41:54.947
for setting me straight first.

41:57.384 --> 41:59.255
I can't believe
if you don't say it.

41:59.299 --> 42:01.997
You know, I wondered
if it was gonna be

42:02.041 --> 42:03.999
a bit of a spoiler
keeping it there,

42:04.043 --> 42:06.001
but you have always been

42:06.045 --> 42:09.396
more clever than observant.

42:11.224 --> 42:13.443
-- Rios.
-- Yes.

42:13.487 --> 42:16.838
You know, he and Teresa started
a medical movement together.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.971
The Mariposas.

42:19.014 --> 42:20.538
-Butterflies.
-Yeah.

42:20.581 --> 42:23.410
And he captained them
through hard times

42:23.453 --> 42:27.806
and tough terrains, and she...
she helped whoever needed help,

42:27.849 --> 42:29.590
whenever they might need it.

42:31.592 --> 42:33.594
And, uh...

42:33.638 --> 42:36.249
the-the boy, uh, Ricardo?

42:36.292 --> 42:38.077
He put together a team

42:38.120 --> 42:40.601
of the brightest minds
in the world.

42:40.645 --> 42:43.299
And they found a way
to heal the ocean

42:43.343 --> 42:46.651
and clean the sky
using an alien organism

42:46.694 --> 42:51.612
that his Auntie Renée discovered
during the Europa Mission.

42:53.222 --> 42:55.834
You know, they would come
in here when they were in town.

42:55.877 --> 42:57.705
We all got pretty close.

42:57.749 --> 42:59.489
Did you know
that Chris could drink

42:59.533 --> 43:02.014
but Teresa could drink him
under the table?

43:02.057 --> 43:05.104
-Every time.

43:05.147 --> 43:08.020
They were such good people.

43:12.415 --> 43:15.462
And how did they...

43:16.463 --> 43:18.378
Ah.

43:18.421 --> 43:20.946
Teresa of old age.

43:20.989 --> 43:23.252
Rios slightly younger,

43:23.296 --> 43:25.733
in a Moroccan bar fight,

43:25.777 --> 43:27.953
over medical supplies.

43:27.996 --> 43:31.565
And best of all, his last breath
was into a cigar.

43:34.002 --> 43:36.614
So he died like he lived.

43:43.925 --> 43:45.579
Elnor, this is for you.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.842
-Oh, no.

43:47.886 --> 43:49.278
No. Oh...

43:51.629 --> 43:53.543
To family, then.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.635
Because...

43:57.678 --> 44:01.116
that's what we are, after all.

44:13.738 --> 44:15.391
That is awful.

44:16.871 --> 44:18.133
-Is it meant to burn like that?
-Burns?

44:18.177 --> 44:20.353
-No.

44:21.354 --> 44:24.574
So, with that toast,

44:24.618 --> 44:27.708
there's somewhere
it's time I got to.

44:27.752 --> 44:30.102
If you will all excuse me.

45:15.800 --> 45:17.715
Extraordinary.

45:20.065 --> 45:24.460
I had it restored so I could
leave it with you before I go.

45:24.504 --> 45:26.636
I thought maybe
a little looking back

45:26.680 --> 45:29.030
might do you some good.

45:29.074 --> 45:33.295
I think I've had
just about enough of that.

45:34.775 --> 45:36.298
Better to look forward.

45:36.342 --> 45:37.735
Is that right?

45:39.824 --> 45:42.174
So...

45:42.217 --> 45:44.393
where is it that you're going?

45:44.437 --> 45:47.832
I'm going on adventures
of my own, Jean-Luc.

45:54.577 --> 45:57.842
There are moments in our lives

45:57.885 --> 46:00.148
we fear to relive

46:00.192 --> 46:04.413
and others we long to repeat.

46:06.546 --> 46:10.724
While time cannot give us
second chances...

46:12.770 --> 46:15.033
...maybe people can.
