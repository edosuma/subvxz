seven, six, five...

30:30.000 --> 30:30.828
seven, six, five...

30:30.895 --> 30:34.432
Four, three, two, one.

30:34.499 --> 30:36.000
Time to die.

30:36.000 --> 30:36.201
Time to die.

30:37.635 --> 30:40.138
[gunshots]

30:48.112 --> 30:49.914
I could go for
a cold beer right now.

30:49.981 --> 30:51.282
OMAR:
Move, 3.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.984
[gunshots]

31:00.191 --> 31:01.859
[grunts]

31:07.565 --> 31:10.401
Oh... come on.

31:10.468 --> 31:12.000
OMAR: 3, this is 2.
Getting shot out of my hide.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.570
OMAR: 3, this is 2.
Getting shot out of my hide.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.405
I'm pinned down.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.378
So much for my cover.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.220
-Bravo 2, what's your status?
-[girl screaming]

31:30.154 --> 31:31.389
Bravo 2, what's your status?

31:31.456 --> 31:33.324
[girl screaming]

31:35.326 --> 31:36.000
[gunshots]

31:36.000 --> 31:38.029
[gunshots]

31:38.096 --> 31:40.031
OMAR: Moving to a better
vantage point, 3.

31:40.098 --> 31:41.599
Smoke will mask you till I land.

31:41.666 --> 31:42.000
She doesn't got that much time.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.235
She doesn't got that much time.

31:44.302 --> 31:45.303
Moving.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.310
-[whistles quietly] Okay.
-[girl crying]

31:52.377 --> 31:54.000
Right here.
[whistling]

31:54.000 --> 31:54.312
Right here.
[whistling]

31:54.379 --> 31:56.414
[crying]

31:58.449 --> 32:00.000
-[gunshots]
-It's okay, okay, come on.

32:00.000 --> 32:00.518
-[gunshots]
-It's okay, okay, come on.

32:05.657 --> 32:06.000
[girl screams]

32:06.000 --> 32:07.191
[girl screams]

32:07.258 --> 32:09.127
Okay, here, give me your hand,
give me your hand.

32:09.193 --> 32:10.995
Come.
Come with me, come on.

32:11.062 --> 32:12.000
-[grunting]
-[gunshots]

32:12.000 --> 32:13.364
-[grunting]
-[gunshots]

32:23.675 --> 32:24.000
You're good, 3.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.410
You're good, 3.

32:25.476 --> 32:26.244
Go.

32:26.311 --> 32:28.379
It's gonna be okay, it's
gonna be okay.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.000
The YPJ's prepping civilians
for evacuation.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.722
The YPJ's prepping civilians
for evacuation.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.190
It's funny, with all that
bouncing around,

32:39.257 --> 32:40.958
the IP signal pinged here
20 minutes

32:41.025 --> 32:42.000
before the Chechens pulled out.

32:42.000 --> 32:42.260
before the Chechens pulled out.

32:42.327 --> 32:45.063
-Here? In this building?
-Within 50 yards of it.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.198
What if whoever is
controlling it was using

32:47.265 --> 32:48.000
their fighters' cell phones

32:48.000 --> 32:49.167
their fighters' cell phones

32:49.233 --> 32:51.302
to mask the source
and throw off tracking?

32:51.369 --> 32:53.304
I mean, that would
explain the bouncing.

32:53.371 --> 32:54.000
Well, Brock and Trent--
they took out Chechens

32:54.000 --> 32:55.440
Well, Brock and Trent--
they took out Chechens

32:55.506 --> 32:56.407
trying to breach here.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.309
Yeah, but we eliminated
two ISIS outside.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.000
And Hamal had a cell phone.

33:00.000 --> 33:00.445
And Hamal had a cell phone.

33:00.511 --> 33:03.214
Okay, so you're saying
it's not the Chechens?

33:03.281 --> 33:05.650
I'm saying I think our list
is still down to three:

33:05.717 --> 33:06.000
I mean, ISIS, Chechens,
and al-Sham Brigade.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.387
I mean, ISIS, Chechens,
and al-Sham Brigade.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.422
So, why don't we just pull
the phones off the dead bodies,

33:11.489 --> 33:12.000
okay, and see whose bounced
the signal-- theirs or Hamal's?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.726
okay, and see whose bounced
the signal-- theirs or Hamal's?

33:14.792 --> 33:16.127
Doesn't work like that, brother.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.595
Are you kidding me?

33:17.662 --> 33:18.000
Fuck.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.263
Fuck.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.300
Major opportunity slipping
through the fingers, Ray.

33:28.072 --> 33:30.000
Um, this looks delicious.

33:30.000 --> 33:30.375
Um, this looks delicious.

33:30.441 --> 33:34.145
Yes, and not nearly as good
as the Cobb salad

33:34.212 --> 33:35.613
at Lulu's Grill
in Virginia Beach.

33:35.680 --> 33:36.000
Is that still the gathering spot
for junior officers?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.616
Is that still the gathering spot
for junior officers?

33:38.683 --> 33:40.284
I've never been.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.000
I usually, um,
eat at the Ops Center

33:42.000 --> 33:43.087
I usually, um,
eat at the Ops Center

33:43.154 --> 33:45.423
so I can keep tabs
on my operators.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.258
When were you stationed
in Vah Beach?

33:47.325 --> 33:48.000
I spent three years in Norfolk
right out of OCS,

33:48.000 --> 33:50.061
I spent three years in Norfolk
right out of OCS,

33:50.128 --> 33:52.330
until I got orders
to my first ship.

33:53.564 --> 33:54.000
So, you wanted to discuss

33:54.000 --> 33:54.365
So, you wanted to discuss

33:54.432 --> 33:56.467
proactive use
of special operators?

33:56.534 --> 34:00.000
I wanted to discuss your
performance on this committee.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.304
I wanted to discuss your
performance on this committee.

34:00.371 --> 34:03.541
Am I not pulling
my weight, ma'am?

34:03.608 --> 34:06.000
Oh, your contributions
seem well-reasoned.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.412
Oh, your contributions
seem well-reasoned.

34:07.478 --> 34:10.548
Yet you appear to be easily
rattled by Major Gerretsen.

34:10.615 --> 34:12.000
Rattled?
[chuckles softly] No...

34:12.000 --> 34:14.085
Rattled?
[chuckles softly] No...

34:14.152 --> 34:16.621
He... came out of the Academy.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.000
You know, he acts like I haven't
earned my seat at the table.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.157
You know, he acts like I haven't
earned my seat at the table.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.092
Perhaps you're acting that way.

34:21.159 --> 34:22.360
Excuse me?

34:22.427 --> 34:24.000
I admire your dedication
to your enlisted men,

34:24.000 --> 34:25.062
I admire your dedication
to your enlisted men,

34:25.129 --> 34:28.099
but your focus as an officer

34:28.166 --> 34:30.000
cannot be solely on them.

34:30.000 --> 34:30.701
cannot be solely on them.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.270
I am trying to keep them safe.

34:32.336 --> 34:34.272
That is why I am
on this committee.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.000
World is scarier than it was
20 years ago, Lieutenant.

34:36.000 --> 34:36.741
World is scarier than it was
20 years ago, Lieutenant.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.409
War isn't going anywhere.

34:38.476 --> 34:41.345
We can't fight it
without special operators.

34:41.412 --> 34:42.000
If you want the other people
on that committee

34:42.000 --> 34:44.415
If you want the other people
on that committee

34:44.482 --> 34:46.784
to help you prioritize
warfighter safety,

34:46.851 --> 34:48.000
then you need to
get to know them,

34:48.000 --> 34:49.120
then you need to
get to know them,

34:49.187 --> 34:50.588
learn what they want,

34:50.655 --> 34:54.000
and figure out how your
objective aligns with theirs.

34:54.000 --> 34:54.091
and figure out how your
objective aligns with theirs.

34:54.692 --> 34:58.496
So, in other words,
play politics?

34:59.363 --> 35:00.000
I'm the head of this committee

35:00.000 --> 35:00.698
I'm the head of this committee

35:00.765 --> 35:02.567
and you don't even know my CV,
for Pete's sake.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.202
[chuckling]

35:04.268 --> 35:06.000
You're here because
you have good ideas.

35:06.000 --> 35:06.237
You're here because
you have good ideas.

35:06.304 --> 35:09.307
I'm telling you how to get
people to, to hear them.

35:09.373 --> 35:12.000
Being a broken record isn't it.

35:12.000 --> 35:12.443
Being a broken record isn't it.

35:17.215 --> 35:18.000
SONNY:
Hey, we're coming in hot!

35:18.000 --> 35:18.583
SONNY:
Hey, we're coming in hot!

35:18.649 --> 35:21.219
Hey, nurse, back, back.
Water, water, water, help.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.187
Right now, right now.
Right away.

35:23.254 --> 35:24.000
Need IV bags.
IV bags!

35:24.000 --> 35:25.590
Need IV bags.
IV bags!

35:27.425 --> 35:29.393
Hey, sit down.
It's gonna be okay.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.000
Baba's gonna be okay, okay?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.662
Baba's gonna be okay, okay?

35:34.532 --> 35:36.000
Omar, you saved my bacon
out there, man.

35:36.000 --> 35:37.468
Omar, you saved my bacon
out there, man.

35:37.535 --> 35:40.338
Which is saying a lot for
a guy who doesn't touch pork.

35:40.404 --> 35:41.606
You could just say,
"You're welcome."

35:41.672 --> 35:42.000
You'd have done the same.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.341
You'd have done the same.

35:43.407 --> 35:45.676
Teamwork makes the dream work,
right?

35:47.512 --> 35:48.000
You know, my, uh,
my daughter Leanne,

35:48.000 --> 35:50.548
You know, my, uh,
my daughter Leanne,

35:50.615 --> 35:53.885
she ain't feeling well
and she been fussy,

35:53.951 --> 35:54.000
you know, she got gas pains
or diaper rash or--

35:54.000 --> 35:55.887
you know, she got gas pains
or diaper rash or--

35:55.953 --> 35:58.456
her baby mama
puts on Taylor Swift

35:58.523 --> 35:59.790
and she just lights up.

35:59.857 --> 36:00.000
[chuckling]

36:00.000 --> 36:01.492
[chuckling]

36:01.559 --> 36:04.362
That's probably where them,
them references came from.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.000
Shit we pick up from our kids.

36:06.000 --> 36:06.597
Shit we pick up from our kids.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.232
Yeah.

36:08.299 --> 36:10.234
My son loved
construction trucks.

36:10.301 --> 36:11.736
To this day,
I see a digger or mixer,

36:11.802 --> 36:12.000
I nearly shit myself

36:12.000 --> 36:13.237
I nearly shit myself

36:13.304 --> 36:15.273
-with excitement. [chuckles]
-JASON: Hey.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.000
Good work out there.

36:18.000 --> 36:18.509
Good work out there.

36:18.576 --> 36:21.212
Help the YPJ get everyone
ready for exfil, got it?

36:21.279 --> 36:22.580
Oh, everyone?

36:22.647 --> 36:24.000
Including Hamal.

36:24.000 --> 36:24.348
Including Hamal.

36:24.415 --> 36:25.783
Respect, Hayes.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.418
Did we just have a moment?

36:27.485 --> 36:29.287
Keep it in your pants, will you?

36:29.353 --> 36:30.000
-[chuckles softly]
-RAY: Jace.

36:30.000 --> 36:30.621
-[chuckles softly]
-RAY: Jace.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.589
JASON:
Yeah.

36:31.656 --> 36:33.658
I think I can get our list
down from three.

36:33.724 --> 36:34.959
What do you mean?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.000
Well, we know the phones were
being used as repeaters, right?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.194
Well, we know the phones were
being used as repeaters, right?

36:37.261 --> 36:38.796
Yeah.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.832
If I can attach a BLE sniffer
to Hamal's phone

36:41.899 --> 36:42.000
and we get him within Bluetooth
range of the main server device

36:42.000 --> 36:44.602
and we get him within Bluetooth
range of the main server device

36:44.669 --> 36:46.604
connecting al-Sham's
phones on target...

36:46.671 --> 36:47.471
Yeah.

36:47.538 --> 36:48.000
...then Hamal's phone
will seed it,

36:48.000 --> 36:48.806
...then Hamal's phone
will seed it,

36:48.873 --> 36:50.308
allowing us to track 'em.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.676
Fucking English, man.

36:51.742 --> 36:52.877
Once we're tracking
al-Sham's phones,

36:52.944 --> 36:54.000
the next time the IP pings,

36:54.000 --> 36:54.512
the next time the IP pings,

36:54.579 --> 36:55.880
we'll know if they're
in the vicinity.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.783
And if they are, then we, we got
the group that hit the Crampton.

36:58.849 --> 36:59.817
Yeah, and if they aren't,

36:59.884 --> 37:00.000
then it's down to two groups.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.852
then it's down to two groups.

37:01.919 --> 37:03.487
ISIS or Chechens.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.489
I don't know, fighting's heavy
right now out there.

37:05.556 --> 37:06.000
It's just chasing the signal--
that's-that's high-risk.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.426
It's just chasing the signal--
that's-that's high-risk.

37:08.492 --> 37:11.228
That's a smart idea, Ray,
but I got to agree with Hayes.

37:11.295 --> 37:12.000
We got intel we can build off.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.830
We got intel we can build off.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.532
We saved a man and his daughter.

37:14.599 --> 37:17.368
And Hamal.
Take the wins and go home.

37:21.005 --> 37:24.000
Jace, you already said yourself

37:24.000 --> 37:24.408
Jace, you already said yourself

37:24.475 --> 37:26.277
that brass is antsy
about us being here.

37:26.344 --> 37:27.945
We spent two weeks
getting nothing.

37:28.012 --> 37:30.000
You really think we got
the luxury to take our time

37:30.000 --> 37:30.448
You really think we got
the luxury to take our time

37:30.514 --> 37:32.450
before they pull the plug?

37:33.050 --> 37:35.453
[speaking Kurdish]

37:43.094 --> 37:45.363
Here you go.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.632
Get him in.

37:54.338 --> 37:55.806
Turn around.

38:03.814 --> 38:05.316
Let's go.

38:14.925 --> 38:17.294
[engine starts]

38:19.797 --> 38:22.066
Listen. All you got to do is
walk in the building

38:22.133 --> 38:23.567
that al-Sham's strongholding.

38:23.634 --> 38:24.000
All right? It's easy.
You're in and you're out.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.536
All right? It's easy.
You're in and you're out.

38:25.603 --> 38:26.971
I thought I was leaving
with the others.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.839
The people that I helped...

38:31.142 --> 38:32.443
JASON:
You do this for us,

38:32.510 --> 38:34.011
we'll get you home safely.

38:34.078 --> 38:35.780
All set.

38:35.846 --> 38:36.000
Just walk around, look for
anybody on a computer or tablet.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.784
Just walk around, look for
anybody on a computer or tablet.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.585
Okay?
