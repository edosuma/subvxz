WEBVTT

00:06.020 --> 00:07.480
Understood.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.190
I'll investigate here, too.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.990
I'll contact you again later.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.430
Um, Rieze?

00:18.050 --> 00:19.540
I-I'm sorry...

00:19.540 --> 00:20.590
It's nothing.

00:20.950 --> 00:22.370
I know this is an important time.

00:24.710 --> 00:27.350
You don't need to put up a brave front.

00:30.550 --> 00:34.860
Would you like to tell me what happened?

02:08.330 --> 02:10.860
Takayama's weapon went out of control?

02:10.860 --> 02:13.530
And Crusty disappeared?

02:14.590 --> 02:17.240
He's missing, and he isn't 
responding to telepathy.

02:17.830 --> 02:20.410
We also have that murderer to think about.

02:20.410 --> 02:25.250
Until more details are known, 
D.D.D. doesn't want word to get out.

02:25.460 --> 02:30.250
Yeah, it may be best to wait 
before we tell the Round Table.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.460
There are Minami spies around, too.

02:33.870 --> 02:36.150
We shouldn't tell Princess Lenessia, either.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.010
Thanks.

02:38.410 --> 02:44.370
Knowing Crusty, he'll come right 
back, as if nothing happened.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.270
You're right.

02:48.740 --> 02:51.010
Henrietta, big trouble!

02:51.010 --> 02:52.440
What's going on?

02:52.780 --> 02:55.580
I need to talk to you about the flavor text.

02:56.960 --> 03:02.660
<b>The Maidens of Watermaple</b>

02:59.060 --> 03:00.800
The Maidens of Watermaple.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.560
The flavor text is becoming real?

03:05.560 --> 03:09.110
Yeah. Originally, it was just backstories for items.

03:09.110 --> 03:13.420
But now, the stuff in the text is 
coming true or happening in reality.

03:13.740 --> 03:18.550
Then we'll also need to be mindful 
of the flavor text in the future.

03:18.990 --> 03:22.050
Yeah, we don't know what will happen.

03:22.580 --> 03:26.310
<i>Which means Misa's weapon's going out of control</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:29.560
<i>might be related to that.</i>

03:30.470 --> 03:31.350
<i>And...</i>

03:32.070 --> 03:34.240
The murderer's Byakumaru...

03:34.690 --> 03:38.130
Its flavor text might have become real, too.

03:39.110 --> 03:42.090
That means the murderer possesses 
not only a Royal Guard's armor,

03:42.090 --> 03:44.620
but a powerful weapon, as well.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.250
Byakumaru is a raid drop, isn't it?

03:49.590 --> 03:53.240
Yes, it's from a raid monster in 
the tenth expansion pack,

03:53.570 --> 03:55.860
the Death Warrior Rugrius.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.580
It was his katana.

03:59.580 --> 04:01.180
Rugrius?

04:01.180 --> 04:04.390
What does its flavor text say?

04:04.680 --> 04:08.050
It describes the legend of Rugrius, 
and how he became a monster.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.190
He was originally one of the Izumo 
Knights, a hero of the Ice Wall,

04:09.250 --> 04:14.400
<b>Legend/ Graupel Sword Byakumaru 

The favorite sword of Rugrius, 
the hero of Ezzo who drove the giants 
to the Jade Garden. This blade freezes 
everything, and contains the rage of the 
hero who met his death at the betrayal 
of the Daughter of Elm, Sutu Inaw.</b>

04:12.190 --> 04:13.860
who fought for a century.

04:14.730 --> 04:18.360
He fought to protect the happiness 
of the people of Susukino,

04:19.590 --> 04:21.280
and he drove away the evil giants.

04:22.410 --> 04:25.200
He was truly the Ezzo Empire's hero.

04:26.090 --> 04:26.870
But...

04:31.710 --> 04:33.890
He was betrayed by the Daughter of Elm,

04:33.890 --> 04:36.540
Sutu Inaw, and poisoned to death.

04:37.320 --> 04:42.970
So, as a raid monster, Rugrius was 
described as angry and hateful.

04:43.310 --> 04:45.610
That's quite a dark story.

04:46.170 --> 04:48.290
Then that hateful spirit has become real,

04:48.290 --> 04:50.980
and is giving the murderer power?

04:51.390 --> 04:52.270
That's ridiculous!

04:53.930 --> 04:56.440
S-Sorry, I just...

04:57.130 --> 05:01.820
If that's the case, we can use it 
to our advantage in our planning.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.190
No... No!

05:19.800 --> 05:22.980
I'm not Rugrius!

05:22.980 --> 05:25.090
I am a proud Defender!

05:25.430 --> 05:27.810
That's right, Nelreth.

05:28.260 --> 05:31.100
You aren't the town guard dog.

05:31.480 --> 05:37.040
You are a chosen hero, with the 
power to surpass the adventurers.

05:37.510 --> 05:41.110
Together, we shall avenge ourselves 
upon the Daughter of Elm

05:41.110 --> 05:43.990
and the humans...

05:53.800 --> 05:56.260
<i>The flavor text is becoming real.</i>

05:57.520 --> 06:02.000
<i>If I'd had Byakumaru, what would 
have happened to me?</i>

06:03.610 --> 06:08.250
<i>With that ugly jealousy I felt toward Minori...</i>

06:11.600 --> 06:14.100
<b>Amenoma</b>

06:26.850 --> 06:28.780
Are you sure?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.280
I think it's better to stay out of it.

06:34.210 --> 06:38.120
His little friend will find the answer on her own.

06:38.530 --> 06:41.100
Will it really be in the Teachings?

06:43.090 --> 06:44.160
Thanks.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.770
They are mere teachings, 
but they are the Teachings.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.140
I believe in the strength of girls.

07:03.070 --> 07:05.880
Okay, we're going to begin training.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.650
Our goal is to take out the murderer.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.910
In accordance with Rieze's plan, 
the raid teams will train

07:12.910 --> 07:15.910
to learn about each other and fight effectively.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.270
Oh, right.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.600
She wants to know the Teachings.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.540
Everyone teach her what you know.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.550
Um, I don't have much to offer, 
but I look forward to our time together.

07:32.990 --> 07:35.270
That sounds like you want to get married!

07:35.270 --> 07:38.430
If Henrietta heard that, she'd be freaking out!

07:39.980 --> 07:42.250
We want to be strong, too!

07:45.330 --> 07:47.720
Let's all do our best, Akatsuki!

07:50.920 --> 07:53.720
Feels good to say what's on your mind, right?

07:54.660 --> 07:56.050
Is everyone ready?

07:56.050 --> 08:00.000
First, you need to be able 
to judge distance by sight.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.120
Teachings? I'm not sure...

08:02.450 --> 08:04.580
Anything you know would help. Please.

08:06.020 --> 08:11.940
It's not something you can get by 
clearing a raid or getting an item...

08:11.940 --> 08:12.970
That's right.

08:13.340 --> 08:15.800
It's nothing that special.

08:16.350 --> 08:19.800
And it's not something you can just teach someone.

08:23.270 --> 08:29.010
For example, our guild master's Teachings 
give him an ability called Eyes of the Void.

08:30.100 --> 08:35.530
It lets him visualize a target's HP and 
status, even if he can't see them.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.030
With this ability,

08:38.030 --> 08:43.140
I can know the HP of players 
behind me, so it's pretty handy.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.510
I see!

08:44.510 --> 08:48.590
But only the guild master can do it,

08:49.030 --> 08:52.090
so I don't know if you can learn it.

08:54.780 --> 08:57.100
That's fine! Teach me anyway!

09:07.260 --> 09:08.270
Again!

09:21.080 --> 09:22.130
<i>The Teachings...</i>

09:22.640 --> 09:25.110
<i>If only I had more of a clue.</i>

09:25.500 --> 09:26.670
Akatsuki!

09:28.940 --> 09:31.130
This is especially for you!

09:31.860 --> 09:33.090
Especially?

09:37.110 --> 09:39.600
<b>You Can Do It</b>

09:45.570 --> 09:47.600
The murderer is a Person of the Land,

09:47.960 --> 09:52.500
and since he was a Royal Guard, 
he has the movable armor's power.

09:52.930 --> 09:55.110
And the Graupel Sword Byakumaru, as well.

09:55.510 --> 10:00.620
With normal attacks, the Byakumaru 
can deal blizzard and cold damage.

10:00.890 --> 10:03.370
Rugrius was a raid boss, right?

10:03.810 --> 10:04.910
Yes.

10:04.910 --> 10:06.850
Taking that into account,

10:06.850 --> 10:10.740
with the flavor text now becoming 
real, it has three effects.

10:11.360 --> 10:14.630
First, freeze status from the blizzard.

10:15.050 --> 10:19.690
Second, all of his stats are buffed for 
every additional person he fights.

10:20.190 --> 10:24.270
For every adventurer within fifty meters,

10:24.560 --> 10:27.890
his attack and defense increase.

10:30.450 --> 10:33.400
Then we can't all fight him at once, huh?

10:33.750 --> 10:35.680
So the plan is...

10:35.680 --> 10:40.500
Instead of six-member raid teams, 
we'll use teams of two or three.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.240
We'll deploy them around Akihabara like a net.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.910
We'll need twenty-four people.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.920
A full raid in Akihabara, huh?

10:49.680 --> 10:51.540
<i>Rieze is amazing...</i>

10:51.540 --> 10:55.920
<i>I'd heard she was the leader of 
Crusty's guild's training division,</i>

10:56.430 --> 11:00.680
<i>but she's explaining her strategy to these 
men without the slightest hesitation.</i>

11:01.080 --> 11:03.910
Aren't those teams a little too small?

11:04.250 --> 11:05.310
How will you coordinate them?

11:05.630 --> 11:09.310
We'll use the raid party chat for communication.

11:09.830 --> 11:15.060
They'll be distributed so that they can 
move in as soon as the target is found.

11:15.060 --> 11:18.810
So, what is Byakumaru's third effect?

11:19.400 --> 11:20.200
What I think it is?

11:20.570 --> 11:21.400
Yes.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.720
A huge boost to his HP.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.370
Depending on the number of people in the zone,

11:26.370 --> 11:29.080
his max HP will change greatly.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.000
That's another troublesome one.

11:32.550 --> 11:34.340
Then what's the plan?

11:34.820 --> 11:39.570
I'd like to issue a curfew confining people 
to their homes until New Year's.

11:40.180 --> 11:45.850
Please have the Round Table ask the 
People of the Land to stay inside.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.850
Well, we can do it, but...

11:49.560 --> 11:51.850
Will it really work?

11:52.210 --> 11:53.550
That's right.

11:53.830 --> 11:59.110
If he has movable armor, he can 
teleport through Akihabara.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.590
If he runs, we can't do anything.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.450
The key to that

12:04.410 --> 12:06.490
is in Princess Lenessia's hands.

12:18.520 --> 12:23.180
You want me to cut off the power 
to the large magic circle?

12:23.180 --> 12:23.970
Yes.

12:26.850 --> 12:28.950
Of course, if we shut off the magic supply,

12:28.950 --> 12:31.130
the movable armor would cease to function.

12:31.630 --> 12:35.820
But at the same time, it would 
disable the city's magic defenses,

12:35.820 --> 12:38.250
allowing monsters to enter the city.

12:38.890 --> 12:40.980
C-Can't you reboot it?

12:40.980 --> 12:44.070
You can't just turn it back on?

12:44.870 --> 12:48.990
All I can say is that it would take decades.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.450
I'm well aware of the risks.

12:56.420 --> 13:00.920
If you accept, Lenessia... Princess...

13:01.340 --> 13:03.430
The mission might succeed.

13:03.430 --> 13:05.340
No, I'll make it succeed!

13:06.580 --> 13:11.830
Does that mean you're asking 
me in my official capacity?

13:12.850 --> 13:15.350
I believe it does.

13:18.020 --> 13:19.740
No matter what your answer,

13:19.740 --> 13:21.850
if it's your will as the princess, 
no one will blame you.

13:22.160 --> 13:25.670
Even if you refuse, it won't affect 
your friendships with us.

13:26.040 --> 13:27.780
There's nothing to worry about.

13:37.940 --> 13:41.820
<i>In the end, I couldn't say whether I'd do it or not.</i>

13:43.280 --> 13:47.420
<i>As their friend, I want to do it.</i>

13:48.700 --> 13:52.060
<i>But as the Marquis's ambassador...</i>

13:53.410 --> 13:54.630
<i>What should I do?</i>

14:00.960 --> 14:02.950
<i>There isn't much time left.</i>

14:03.290 --> 14:04.350
<i>What should I do?</i>

14:05.830 --> 14:08.070
How's it coming along?

14:08.810 --> 14:11.510
When's the operation?

14:12.660 --> 14:13.780
New Year's Eve.

14:14.350 --> 14:15.650
I see.

14:15.650 --> 14:19.080
Solve the year's problems 
before the year ends, yes?

14:19.620 --> 14:24.090
I want to learn the Teachings, 
but I still don't know anything.

14:24.470 --> 14:28.790
Is there anything I can do?

14:29.230 --> 14:30.500
Thank you.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.600
I'm all right.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.480
Okay.

14:33.920 --> 14:38.100
But I think you may be trying a bit too hard.

14:40.680 --> 14:43.610
My lord, why not take a break?

14:44.240 --> 14:45.280
Thanks.

14:45.850 --> 14:48.110
But I want to do everything I can.

14:48.590 --> 14:50.620
But you don't have to push yourself too hard.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.500
I'm not pushing myself too hard.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.330
I can try hard because I want to.

14:56.860 --> 15:00.880
I don't know why my lord is trying so hard.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.850
But he is.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.500
So I'll do my best, too.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.390
I can't worry about my own pride 
if I want to defeat the murderer.

15:12.010 --> 15:14.390
Because I'm weak.

15:18.190 --> 15:21.250
Hey, keep your distance, and go around.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.900
Don't let those buffs wear off.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.210
What's important is to truly know your enemy.

15:26.630 --> 15:31.770
Know exactly what they can 
and what they can't do.

15:34.770 --> 15:36.730
<i>I'm weak.</i>

15:37.720 --> 15:38.370
<i>But...</i>

15:38.900 --> 15:42.140
<i>There are things you can only learn 
by accepting your weakness.</i>

15:42.840 --> 15:46.910
<i>Being weak, losing... 
These aren't pointless things.</i>

15:49.150 --> 15:51.050
<i>I can't do anything on my own.</i>

15:51.410 --> 15:52.220
<i>But...</i>

15:52.760 --> 15:55.040
Akatsuki, do you use these?

15:55.440 --> 15:57.380
They're good for defense.

15:58.030 --> 15:59.230
Thank you.

15:59.670 --> 16:02.540
Here, have some strawberries, Akatsuki.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.520
We got lots to make Christmas cakes, 
but we had some leftover.

16:07.070 --> 16:08.100
Thank you.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.780
<i>I can become strong with everyone.</i>

16:13.590 --> 16:15.400
You are small...

16:16.120 --> 16:17.870
But that's actually an advantage.

16:19.350 --> 16:21.210
He's huge, right?

16:21.210 --> 16:24.380
He won't be able to keep up 
if you dance all around him.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.630
It makes it easy to get in his blind spots.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.880
Let's try.

16:34.030 --> 16:37.430
<i>I've always been ashamed of my height.</i>

16:37.840 --> 16:40.430
<i>But I never thought that weakness 
could also be a strength.</i>

16:41.390 --> 16:44.690
<i>Know exactly what they can and can't do!</i>

16:46.130 --> 16:47.900
This is it!

16:48.890 --> 16:51.650
You're training to defeat the murderer, right?

16:51.940 --> 16:53.360
I heard about it from Michitaka,

16:52.650 --> 16:57.650
<b>Seine/ Adventurer</b>

16:52.650 --> 16:57.650
<b>Shironiji/ Adventurer</b>

16:53.360 --> 16:55.200
and decided I wanted to help.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.660
Are you still recruiting?

16:58.040 --> 16:59.220
Of course.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.040
What about you, Seine?

17:02.420 --> 17:04.040
Y-Yeah.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.920
Nah, it's nothing...

17:10.180 --> 17:12.760
This gives us twenty-four members.

17:12.760 --> 17:16.060
I'll ask you to take care of that other matter.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.120
As a twenty-fifth member.

17:18.710 --> 17:19.930
Understood.

17:29.490 --> 17:33.520
I'm so happy you came, Princess Lenessia!

17:34.330 --> 17:36.650
Mikakage, are the rice balls ready?

17:37.510 --> 17:39.540
Oh, right. It's lunchtime already, huh?

17:39.540 --> 17:41.400
It's hardly "already"...

17:41.860 --> 17:44.150
If you don't hurry, you won't make it in time.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.470
Sorry!

17:45.470 --> 17:46.790
U-Um...

17:47.250 --> 17:49.630
Please let me help with something.

17:49.940 --> 17:51.810
Huh? You, Princess?

17:52.150 --> 17:53.880
Do you have the cooking skill?

17:54.270 --> 17:57.010
Eh? Um, I don't know...

17:58.300 --> 17:59.480
Want to try?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.640
I'm starved.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.150
Let's dig in.

18:10.150 --> 18:11.790
Let's eat!

18:24.010 --> 18:25.650
May I sit here?

18:26.680 --> 18:27.880
Y-Yeah.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.450
I made that.

18:35.870 --> 18:38.800
It doesn't look like much, but it's good.

18:39.350 --> 18:40.500
I'm glad.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.710
I'm sorry.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.520
I thought it was convenient for me.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.610
What was?

18:50.920 --> 18:55.570
When you tried to defeat 
the murderer that day.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.890
It was only for a second,

18:57.890 --> 19:01.150
but I thought that if you defeated the murderer,

19:01.690 --> 19:05.250
I could avoid a conflict between 
adventurers and People of the Land.

19:07.840 --> 19:11.860
I thought of crying to my grandfather or to Crusty.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.090
But that would be no different from before.

19:15.670 --> 19:20.340
I'd just be avoiding responsibility, 
like the man from the Kunie

19:20.340 --> 19:22.850
who told me about this.

19:24.350 --> 19:27.150
But I'm still uneasy.

19:27.650 --> 19:29.330
I can't make a decision.

19:29.950 --> 19:32.110
When you said I was your friend,

19:32.670 --> 19:33.840
it made me happy.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.780
I don't know why you're uneasy,

19:36.780 --> 19:38.380
but everyone is here.

19:38.770 --> 19:39.870
I'm here.

19:40.340 --> 19:41.420
I'm your friend.

19:41.860 --> 19:43.010
Akatsuki...

19:44.120 --> 19:46.830
Hey, we're going to get started!

19:46.830 --> 19:47.870
Okay!

19:53.790 --> 19:54.980
Friends...

20:02.770 --> 20:04.110
Well?

20:04.110 --> 20:05.680
Getting close to figuring something out?

20:08.000 --> 20:12.290
The real Teaching is being able to 
say that Teachings are stupid.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.120
Tatara?

20:20.760 --> 20:21.970
If I'd known...

20:28.850 --> 20:30.740
I never would have sold it to him.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.760
Of course not. I know that.

20:33.270 --> 20:34.230
Everyone does.

20:40.810 --> 20:42.630
<i>I can't run away.</i>

20:43.060 --> 20:46.060
<i>If I turn this over to someone 
else because I'm weak,</i>

20:46.060 --> 20:50.110
<i>I'll be admitting that I'm not 
only weak, but also inferior.</i>

20:51.190 --> 20:53.180
<i>I couldn't be their friend.</i>

20:56.780 --> 20:58.070
Princess Lenessia...

20:58.750 --> 21:00.570
Please let me participate, too!

21:01.250 --> 21:05.120
You'll be the twenty-sixth maiden of Watermaple.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.580
<b>Screaming Sword Haganemushi</b>

21:08.350 --> 21:10.580
<b>Legend/ Screaming Sword Haganemushi 

A legendary short sword that causes any armor it 
strikes to instantly rust away, earning it the name 
Haganemushi, or "metal-eating bug." Any blade 
it clashes against grows duller with each blow.</b>

21:18.170 --> 21:21.820
<i>In the end, I didn't learn a single Teaching.</i>

21:23.360 --> 21:24.330
<i>But...</i>

21:25.320 --> 21:27.270
<i>Now I have everyone with me!</i>

21:31.190 --> 21:33.350
Off you go.

21:33.810 --> 21:35.500
Let's do this!

21:35.500 --> 21:36.860
Yeah!

21:39.880 --> 21:41.410
It's finally time.

21:43.150 --> 21:45.360
Time to smash faces.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.920
Just two?

22:03.750 --> 22:07.490
I've been underestimated...

22:09.670 --> 22:10.810
It's not enough.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.850
Gather many subjects,

22:14.850 --> 22:16.570
make them kneel,

22:16.570 --> 22:18.650
and take their lives.

22:19.990 --> 22:21.800
The Daughter of Elm...

22:22.220 --> 22:24.830
The humans who betrayed me...

22:25.150 --> 22:27.200
I'll destroy them all!

22:27.490 --> 22:28.440
Let's go!

24:05.930 --> 24:07.720
At last, the raid begins.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.130
The murderer's blade shines within the blizzard.

24:10.130 --> 24:13.290
Akatsuki fights, thinking of 
the twenty-sixth maiden.

24:13.290 --> 24:16.200
But her blade shatters, and her 
fate is about to be sealed.

24:16.610 --> 24:20.690
When despair rules the town, 
the twenty-seventh maiden appears.

24:20.690 --> 24:23.440
Akatsuki's Teaching is about to be unleashed.

24:23.770 --> 24:25.280
Next time: Akihabara Raid.

24:23.770 --> 24:29.940
<b>Akihabara Raid</b>

24:25.710 --> 24:27.550
Rise up once more.
