Synchro: mpm, Arrow

01:19.438 --> 01:20.788
Please come back.

01:23.323 --> 01:24.410
Come back.

01:34.788 --> 01:35.995
Hi, I made tea.

01:37.705 --> 01:40.439
- I didn't mean to surprise you...
- It's OK, Anthea.

01:42.965 --> 01:46.317
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you know... Just, just looking.

01:47.077 --> 01:48.077
Right.

01:49.015 --> 01:50.015
Whizzer.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.178
Eff's a bit out of it.

01:55.953 --> 01:58.003
She's beautiful... Not like me.

01:58.861 --> 02:00.861
Seems like somebody likes you!

02:01.191 --> 02:02.824
My boyfriend gave it to me.

02:03.974 --> 02:05.705
I only knew him three days.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.336
Now he's gone.

02:08.457 --> 02:10.384
But it was fun while it lasted?

02:12.038 --> 02:13.399
So much fun...

02:13.519 --> 02:15.169
Yeah, it's called love.

02:15.771 --> 02:18.649
- That's a big word!
- I dunno. Four letters is...

02:22.584 --> 02:24.284
But I'm sure it is love.

02:25.027 --> 02:26.959
All you want to do
is kiss them and...

02:27.147 --> 02:28.757
you know, other stuff?

02:29.526 --> 02:30.826
Brilliant stuff.

02:36.026 --> 02:37.635
Yeah, brilliant stuff.

02:39.291 --> 02:42.239
Maybe this Thomas will hop
on a train and come back to see you.

02:42.401 --> 02:44.656
- You can't get a train from the Congo.
- Congo?

02:44.776 --> 02:46.741
Yeah, it's a Democratic Republic,

02:46.861 --> 02:48.920
located on the Equator
bordering Gabon and Cameroon.

02:49.081 --> 02:50.646
Yeah, I remember now.

02:51.085 --> 02:52.416
I really miss him.

02:53.029 --> 02:54.869
You think love conquers all, Anthea?

02:59.641 --> 03:01.091
I hope so, sweetie.

03:03.227 --> 03:05.134
Why don't you wake up
the sleeping beauty

03:05.254 --> 03:08.364
and tell her we have something
called "breakfast" in our country?

03:18.639 --> 03:20.416
After that we had to get out
mega-speedily,

03:20.536 --> 03:24.163
so we climbed over some spiky fence,
and found ourselves in this field.

03:24.973 --> 03:27.094
- Then what did we do, Eff?
- Can't remember.

03:27.492 --> 03:29.022
We either went to the park{\ to find the boys}

03:29.142 --> 03:31.005
and then got chips,
or the other way round.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.639
- Which was it, Eff?
- Chips. Oh, yeah.

03:33.801 --> 03:36.733
Super cool. Brown sauce
soaks up all the Red Bulls.

03:37.160 --> 03:40.560
Then we went crazy cos Cook pulled down
JJ's pants and showed us his willy.

03:41.353 --> 03:43.399
Morning, Mum... Yeah thanks.

03:43.561 --> 03:45.719
Super duper great night
at the youth centre.

03:45.881 --> 03:48.039
I made soup, we prayed
and recycled socks.

03:48.541 --> 03:50.954
Soup - for the homeless,
they love soup.

03:52.642 --> 03:54.040
Cream of mushroom...

03:54.357 --> 03:56.920
Okey-doke.
Effy says, "Howdy doody."

03:57.667 --> 03:59.080
See you later, alligator.

04:00.544 --> 04:01.844
Did you just...?

04:02.172 --> 04:05.365
- That was a pack of lies.
- Oh, you can't tell my mum the truth.

04:05.485 --> 04:07.845
She'd only do agony
flip and go ra-ra.

04:09.146 --> 04:10.425
Is she speaking English?

04:10.545 --> 04:12.494
She means the truth hurts, Dad.

04:12.614 --> 04:14.360
It's for her own good.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.247
Otherwise, truth...

04:19.452 --> 04:22.268
- You all right, love?
- Yeah, I just... I just gotta...

04:23.760 --> 04:25.900
- Stop it.
- You stop it.

04:26.680 --> 04:29.760
Is someone going to start speaking
a language round here I understand?

04:35.366 --> 04:37.719
Steve, mate?
Am I driving today?

04:39.536 --> 04:42.831
You're doing the International Webcam
and Hard Drive Expo in Poole.

04:42.951 --> 04:44.851
You don't want to miss that.

04:45.179 --> 04:46.184
I can't do it.

04:46.304 --> 04:50.000
Jesus! You should have told me,
I fucking love those hard drive events.

04:50.270 --> 04:52.501
- Jim, who are you talking...?
- I need you.

04:52.621 --> 04:55.436
OK, I'll get the car keys.
Get you to Poole in no time.

04:55.601 --> 04:57.599
For fuck's sake, I love you!

04:58.254 --> 05:01.104
When are you fucking
going to understand that?

05:05.874 --> 05:08.093
Mate, I'm... I'm married.

05:08.373 --> 05:09.505
I'm straight.

05:09.625 --> 05:12.692
Don't do dick, no way no how,
but, you know...

05:12.812 --> 05:14.893
I mean, <i>c'est la vie</i>.
Each to their own.

05:15.013 --> 05:16.719
- I told you...
- It's too late.

05:28.751 --> 05:29.751
Wallop!

05:31.301 --> 05:32.660
Bitch! Bitch!

05:35.205 --> 05:38.310
You don't understand! Jim, please!

05:39.063 --> 05:40.937
- Listen!
- All those weekends!

05:41.057 --> 05:44.480
Those bendy fucking yoga weekends
in Dartmouth!

05:47.326 --> 05:49.166
You were bending
all right, weren't you?

05:49.286 --> 05:51.356
In all the right fucking places!

05:52.882 --> 05:54.104
Just let me...

05:54.224 --> 05:55.944
I just want to explain to you.

05:59.664 --> 06:01.944
You've done enough
explaining, haven't you?

06:04.401 --> 06:06.280
- I'm sorry.
- I love you.

06:06.853 --> 06:08.453
Please don't leave me.

06:17.266 --> 06:19.000
What a mess.

06:22.914 --> 06:24.264
They fuck you up.

06:25.158 --> 06:26.762
They don't mean to, Eff.

06:27.548 --> 06:28.648
But they do.

06:34.922 --> 06:36.072
Not now, Mum.

06:53.479 --> 06:54.719
Bugger it, Eff.

06:54.988 --> 06:56.588
You can't half leg it.

06:58.054 --> 06:59.820
And I've got cross-country badge!

07:03.056 --> 07:05.999
Do you think your mum
and funny beard have been, you know...

07:07.675 --> 07:08.875
making monkey?

07:09.759 --> 07:12.571
Yes, Pandora.
They've been making monkey.

07:15.011 --> 07:16.240
Surfed and turfed...

07:21.771 --> 07:23.021
Eff, don't cry.

07:25.801 --> 07:28.240
Does... does this mean you're not coming
to my pyjama party?

07:28.953 --> 07:30.159
I'm not crying.

07:30.824 --> 07:31.824
Right.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.353
But my party?

07:34.893 --> 07:35.893
Sure.

07:36.254 --> 07:37.254
Why not?

07:37.726 --> 07:40.082
Let's get totally, totally fucked.

07:40.540 --> 07:41.802
Yeah, that's the thing.

07:41.952 --> 07:44.711
My mum's gonna be there and we're
gonna put on pyjamas and play Twister.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.311
It's brilliant fun,
more fun than getting fucked...

07:47.454 --> 07:50.027
probably. And then you're all going
to tell me how to do it with Tommo

07:50.147 --> 07:52.097
because I haven't got a clue.

07:54.396 --> 07:56.296
Pandora, why are we friends?

07:56.830 --> 07:58.287
Do you ever wonder?

07:58.727 --> 07:59.960
That's super easy.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.093
You're my pal
because you're the coolest ever,

08:02.213 --> 08:04.287
and I'm yours because
I'll totally do anything you say

08:04.407 --> 08:07.120
and none of your boyfriends
ever want to surf me cos I'm useless.

08:07.419 --> 08:08.459
That's it?

08:14.236 --> 08:15.236
Come on,

08:16.076 --> 08:18.018
- let's get hot chocolates.
- Cool.

08:23.338 --> 08:24.969
I've been ringing you loads!

08:25.089 --> 08:28.369
You know Danny, he plays for
the Bristol Rovers Reserves, yeah?

08:28.838 --> 08:30.873
Yes, nice one, tasty.

08:31.256 --> 08:33.202
This is my new best friend, Effy.

08:33.715 --> 08:35.206
Cool tits, yeah?

08:36.239 --> 08:38.860
- Sorry?
- Nice jugglies, babe... perky.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.409
He doesn't mean it, do you, babes?

08:41.530 --> 08:42.980
Fuckin' right I do!

08:44.364 --> 08:45.664
And I'm Pandora.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.288
Hey kid, you should come up the ground,
watch the lads train, yeah?

08:50.408 --> 08:53.469
Cos after, we get some Lambrinis in,
we go lucky in the showers?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.640
He's joking, right?

08:59.348 --> 09:00.348
Right.

09:00.481 --> 09:02.594
Anyway. Can't wait for
this party tonight.

09:02.914 --> 09:05.425
- I've got a shitload of weed and pills.
- Weeds?

09:05.780 --> 09:08.360
- Cool.
- Yeah man. Way safe... Orgy!

09:08.520 --> 09:10.560
You're not coming.
It's girls only. Right?

09:11.401 --> 09:13.609
We're gonna tell secrets
and get intimate, no boys.

09:13.729 --> 09:14.729
Intimate?!

09:15.360 --> 09:18.200
Yes. Nice one!
Take photos, babe!

09:20.727 --> 09:22.908
So I've got Flying Saucepans
and Love Fountains.

09:23.028 --> 09:24.874
- We're gonna fry!
- But, we're doing Twister.

09:24.994 --> 09:27.174
- Cool. You can snort that, right?
- Not exactly.

09:27.294 --> 09:30.009
- Love Fountains are mint!
- Mum's making brownies.

09:31.221 --> 09:32.040
You OK?

09:32.782 --> 09:35.792
She's upset because her mum's been
making monkey and her dad's gone ape.

09:36.036 --> 09:38.960
Bananas! Cos Beardy Steve's been making
her do the Funky Gibbon and...

09:39.856 --> 09:41.560
- I've boobed, haven't I?
- Yes!

09:41.720 --> 09:42.986
I loves the Funky Gibbon!

09:44.410 --> 09:45.738
You're gonna fuck off?

09:45.858 --> 09:47.127
We need girl time.

09:47.989 --> 09:49.600
Practice your ball skills, babe.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.630
I'll do that keepy-uppy thing later,
remember?

10:22.773 --> 10:24.373
Mum's done the signal.

10:25.899 --> 10:28.299
So everybody knows
where my party is.

10:28.869 --> 10:30.460
How many people did you invite?

10:30.798 --> 10:33.351
Four. You, Eff, Emily and Naomi.

10:35.055 --> 10:38.215
- Why did you invite her?
- Em's says I have to or she won't come.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.526
- Sweet.
- Come on.

10:40.646 --> 10:43.105
We can do brownies
and then lick our bowls out.

10:44.371 --> 10:46.501
Do you think she knows
she sounds filthy half the time?

10:46.621 --> 10:48.169
Sometimes I wonder.

10:52.339 --> 10:53.589
Blastification!

10:54.781 --> 10:56.531
Drat! Drat! Fiddlesticks!

10:57.721 --> 11:00.914
Panda, we have spoken about shouting
like a goat in the house.

11:01.034 --> 11:02.960
Sorry. Look, Mum. Friends!

11:03.283 --> 11:05.853
Still shouting, Panda.
Calm time, please.

11:07.223 --> 11:08.920
I'm calm.

11:18.401 --> 11:20.036
So... this is Effy.

11:20.156 --> 11:22.239
Effy! We meet at last.

11:22.937 --> 11:24.664
Pandora has told me
so much about you.

11:24.784 --> 11:26.786
Yeah, you know...
your missionary work.

11:26.906 --> 11:29.200
Yes, I try and do as
much of that as I can.

11:29.767 --> 11:32.414
That's good. There's so
many bad things in the world.

11:32.534 --> 11:33.834
Boys, and drugs,

11:34.330 --> 11:35.650
guns, alcohol.

11:36.534 --> 11:38.344
Boys. Evil things.

11:39.201 --> 11:42.041
I'm glad Pandora's found a channel
she can pour her energy into.

11:42.161 --> 11:43.800
All the seamen like her.

11:44.997 --> 11:45.997
Seamen?

11:46.480 --> 11:49.440
Loads of seamen.
Some of them are homeless as well.

11:49.949 --> 11:53.174
We'd all love to see Pandora
get her own missionary position.

11:55.772 --> 11:56.772
Right...

11:57.022 --> 11:59.280
Lovely. And this is?

12:01.460 --> 12:04.920
- I haven't heard about you.
- She's a new friend, Mum. Stupid.

12:06.962 --> 12:09.266
Well, that's wonderful.

12:09.386 --> 12:11.968
We're not used to having so many
friends, are we, Panda?

12:12.088 --> 12:13.593
No. And I've got more.

12:13.713 --> 12:14.763
Heaps more.

12:15.150 --> 12:17.372
- Two more.
- Four friends.

12:17.492 --> 12:20.120
Goodness. We're going to have
a wild old time, aren't we?

12:20.354 --> 12:22.720
I hope you all like
playing Monster in the Dark.

12:23.091 --> 12:24.600
Looking forward to it.

12:25.614 --> 12:29.009
I expect you all want to wash
your hands and take your shoes off.

12:30.779 --> 12:33.158
Come on. I'll show you
Mum's special box.

12:45.519 --> 12:48.520
"London's burning London's burning

12:48.680 --> 12:50.840
"Fetch the engines Fetch the engines

12:51.142 --> 12:52.480
"Fire, fire!
Fire, fire!

13:11.640 --> 13:16.012
"Making brownies, making brownies
Really yummy, really yummy

13:16.132 --> 13:20.400
"Making brownies, making brownies
In the kitchen, in the kitchen...

13:25.542 --> 13:26.839
Fucking hell.

13:31.297 --> 13:32.714
Nothing, young lady.

13:33.592 --> 13:35.467
I have nothing to say to you at all.

13:37.475 --> 13:38.809
What the fuck is that?

13:43.493 --> 13:46.873
I've never been to a pyjama party
before, so I brought vodka.

13:47.234 --> 13:48.932
- Was that right?
- Dunno.

13:50.925 --> 13:53.000
- I don't wear pyjamas.
- Right.

13:55.178 --> 13:56.920
I dunno why she invited me anyway.

13:57.301 --> 14:00.000
- I hardly know her.
- I asked her to invite you.

14:01.603 --> 14:03.940
- I thought we sorted this out.
- No, I didn't mean that.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.183
Well, it doesn't hurt
to get to know each other.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.618
We're in the same class.

14:07.738 --> 14:09.598
We'll be hanging out
for the next 2 years...

14:09.718 --> 14:12.120
You going to tell people
you're gay anytime soon?

14:13.239 --> 14:14.239
What?

14:14.807 --> 14:15.802
I'm not.

14:16.127 --> 14:17.120
I'm not gay.

14:19.495 --> 14:20.523
Telling you, Em.

14:20.643 --> 14:22.592
You haven't thought this through,
have you?

14:23.429 --> 14:24.855
So can I just say again?

14:25.117 --> 14:27.999
Me, not muff muncher.
Me, cock cruncher.

14:30.611 --> 14:32.161
You getting any cock?

14:34.747 --> 14:35.847
I have done.

14:37.246 --> 14:39.496
Except he had erectile dysfunction.

14:40.094 --> 14:41.226
17 times.

14:42.484 --> 14:44.728
I was getting tennis elbow,
you know.

14:51.602 --> 14:53.476
Can I help you with something?

14:54.875 --> 14:58.875
This is a quiet cul-de-sac
and you are disgraceful young women.

15:00.027 --> 15:02.100
So go fuck yourself, tosser.

15:06.022 --> 15:07.022
What?

15:09.188 --> 15:11.435
More friends! Naomi and Emily!

15:11.555 --> 15:13.198
Calm, please, Panda.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
I'm calm.

15:18.593 --> 15:21.155
We've been so looking forward
to this, haven't we, Panda?

15:22.444 --> 15:23.444
What?

15:23.635 --> 15:24.635
Shoes!

15:26.592 --> 15:27.992
Are you all chums?

15:29.809 --> 15:31.674
Ems and Naomi are real good friends.

15:31.794 --> 15:33.720
- How lovely.
- Really good,

15:34.410 --> 15:36.156
and now they like me as well.

15:38.175 --> 15:39.747
Hang on. Aren't you Katie?

15:39.867 --> 15:41.967
That's the amazing thing! Katie!

15:42.613 --> 15:44.982
They're twins.
<i>C'est incroyable</i>, baby!

15:45.102 --> 15:48.039
- Sorry?
- It's French. Thomas taught me!

15:48.201 --> 15:50.351
He's such a blinkin' dream and...

15:52.185 --> 15:53.185
Bugger.

15:54.429 --> 15:55.579
Who's Thomas?

15:57.412 --> 15:58.462
You know...

16:00.619 --> 16:04.160
Pandora. I do hope you haven't been
defying me on the subject of boys.

16:07.119 --> 16:09.019
He's my boyfriend, actually.

16:09.531 --> 16:11.440
He does... excellent French.

16:11.789 --> 16:12.889
Right. Well,

16:13.649 --> 16:16.381
- She knows my opinion on boyfriends.
- They just want to get into my box.

16:16.501 --> 16:19.314
Yes, and I do hope all of you
will respect that in this house

16:19.434 --> 16:21.834
we do not allow unruly males
at parties.

16:22.684 --> 16:25.070
I'm sure your parents
would say the same thing.

16:27.158 --> 16:29.723
Boys. Yuk. Disgusting.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.947
There you go, Katie and Emily.

16:33.067 --> 16:34.631
Completely identical.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.943
Are you interested in
all the same things?

16:38.863 --> 16:40.439
- I'm not sure.
- You like Twister?

16:40.601 --> 16:42.924
- Sorry?
- Twister! It's brill!

16:43.194 --> 16:45.073
It's gonna be twistomatic, baby!

16:45.354 --> 16:49.193
Pandora gets over-stimulated.
We do exercises nightly.

16:49.910 --> 16:51.320
I've left pyjamas out for you.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.679
They're pink... and clean.
Very, very clean.

17:17.090 --> 17:18.400
Are they nicely gooey?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.223
I'm certainly hoping so.

17:20.685 --> 17:21.685
Heavenly.

17:22.326 --> 17:23.522
You know,

17:24.240 --> 17:27.880
You know, I'm wondering if if you aren't
a little bit naughty, Effy.

17:29.218 --> 17:30.218
I am.

17:31.003 --> 17:35.003
I bet you're naughty enough to try these
brownies with me before anybody else.

17:35.525 --> 17:36.925
I'll try anything.

17:37.163 --> 17:39.276
Okay, then. Let's dive in.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.680
I love brownies. I love them.

17:50.994 --> 17:51.994
Twister.

17:55.195 --> 17:56.695
Are you shitting me?

17:58.094 --> 17:59.194
Don't worry.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.249
I spiked the chocolate brownies
with MDMA.

18:03.161 --> 18:04.591
- You what?
- Yeah.

18:04.868 --> 18:08.200
Appreciate it, OK. There's
fucking 40 quid's worth in there.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.356
- You think it's funny?
- It is kind of.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.581
Yeah, enter into the spirit, Ems.

18:18.271 --> 18:21.869
So, Katie, you gonna be nice to me now,
we're Twister pals?

18:21.989 --> 18:24.331
I promise not to grab your minge
and everything.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.250
Hands off the muff and we're sorted.

18:29.730 --> 18:31.485
Gotcha, no buffing the beaver.

18:31.605 --> 18:33.205
No groping the growler.

18:33.325 --> 18:35.012
Don't tickle on my tinkle.

18:35.402 --> 18:38.160
- Okay, I won't fluff up your flange.
- You done?

18:39.469 --> 18:41.800
We're double done with the DNA dump.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.379
Hey, guys!
What do you think?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.699
Mum made them specially, and look!

18:51.178 --> 18:53.280
- Jesus.
- So you can have Sexy Poo...

18:55.240 --> 18:56.440
or Brainy Poo.

18:57.776 --> 19:00.265
Except for me, cos I have Panda Poo!

19:01.487 --> 19:04.617
Mum and me sewed 'em on.
It was a wacker job, I'm telling you.

19:04.737 --> 19:08.010
- I'm not wearing that.
- Why not? It's a pyjama party.

19:08.983 --> 19:11.520
- What the fuck? Give it here.
- Whizzer poo!

19:11.686 --> 19:13.458
Because look what goes with them.

19:15.059 --> 19:16.316
Isn't Mum wick?

19:29.068 --> 19:31.039
- Are they getting undressed?
- They're not.

19:31.159 --> 19:32.520
Why would they get undressed?

19:36.162 --> 19:37.211
Can I remind you

19:37.331 --> 19:40.001
that Pandora's party is specified
as a girls-only event.

19:41.293 --> 19:42.890
And you know what that means?

19:43.812 --> 19:44.840
Of course I do.

19:49.843 --> 19:51.520
So I'm not 100% sure what it means.

19:53.732 --> 19:55.869
So let me enlighten you, Double J.

19:56.533 --> 19:58.710
Pyjama party means only one thing:

19:59.245 --> 20:01.880
- girls getting friendly.
- Friendly?

20:03.944 --> 20:05.144
Real friendly.

20:06.723 --> 20:09.324
Hang on. Even I know
that only happens in overblown

20:09.444 --> 20:11.196
and possibly illegal teen dramas.

20:11.316 --> 20:14.574
Mum says there's a lot less sex
going on than I might imagine.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.311
You never experienced
wish fulfilment, J?

20:19.571 --> 20:20.571
Never.

20:21.783 --> 20:23.004
They're all in there,

20:23.449 --> 20:26.680
girls getting to know each other,
experimenting, getting lubed up

20:26.840 --> 20:29.924
and gagging for forbidden fruit
and we're gonna give it to them.

20:30.044 --> 20:31.535
If Freddie was here...

20:32.526 --> 20:35.119
Do you see Freddie?
Did we invite Freddie?

20:36.170 --> 20:38.817
- And why didn't we invite him?
- Because he's a fun-sponge?

20:38.937 --> 20:39.937
You got it.

20:41.160 --> 20:41.986
You see?

20:42.870 --> 20:43.970
It's a sign.

20:49.281 --> 20:50.718
I'll call the police.

21:58.436 --> 21:59.436
Come on!

21:59.703 --> 22:02.280
This is a fantasy and I have
to tell you, a poorly constructed one.

22:02.919 --> 22:05.032
Because I have a natural facility
on a climbing wall...

22:05.152 --> 22:07.652
Get in there. Come on,
we need to see them doing it.

22:07.772 --> 22:09.972
For the last time,
they won't be doing it.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.720
They won't be naked, or engaged
in mutual masturbation...

22:12.880 --> 22:14.154
- Check.
- What?

22:14.274 --> 22:17.436
I'm requesting a check.
Is that too much to ask of a friend?

22:25.563 --> 22:27.532
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

22:27.652 --> 22:28.760
What... What?

22:28.920 --> 22:30.760
- They're n... na...
- Please say naked.

22:30.920 --> 22:32.653
- Nearly naked.
- That's good enough.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.520
What the fuck?

22:45.720 --> 22:47.800
- Come on, Eff, pyjamas.
- Whatever...

23:00.783 --> 23:03.003
I can't hang on.
I'm going to slip!

23:08.880 --> 23:10.320
- What was that?
- Nothing.

23:10.613 --> 23:12.245
Tummy. Too much cake...

23:14.948 --> 23:17.160
Mum, look. We're pretty in pink!

23:18.709 --> 23:20.553
That's wonderful, girls.

23:21.441 --> 23:22.987
I must compliment myself, though.

23:23.107 --> 23:25.568
My brownies are usually delicious,

23:25.949 --> 23:29.279
but I've really excelled myself.
This is my third already.

23:29.441 --> 23:32.039
I'm gonna have three.
Thanks, Mum.

23:32.309 --> 23:33.401
Yeah, sure...

23:36.411 --> 23:37.467
Listen to that.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.416
Can you hear the music?

23:49.955 --> 23:50.694
Mum?

23:51.243 --> 23:52.640
Oh, that's beautiful.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.160
It sounds...

23:55.874 --> 23:57.632
- What's she doing?
- Wonderful.

23:58.361 --> 23:59.611
I'm getting it!

24:00.802 --> 24:02.080
I'm telling you.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.227
That is fucking good shit!

24:04.960 --> 24:06.040
What have you done?

24:06.200 --> 24:09.480
Eat a cake, Panda.
It's gonna be a long night.

25:02.678 --> 25:05.190
I'm telling you, man.
We gotta fucking get in there!

25:06.869 --> 25:09.950
Freddie says, every time you ask me
to do something, just say no.

25:10.121 --> 25:11.830
- He said that?
- Yes. It's a song

25:12.154 --> 25:15.537
which gives useful lifestyle advice
but it's also a state of mind.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.936
Maybe me and Freds will have words.

25:18.056 --> 25:20.624
But somehow, Gay J,
I'm going to this party.

25:20.744 --> 25:21.794
You coming?

25:26.061 --> 25:27.188
Just say no.

25:27.498 --> 25:29.013
Suit yourself, Gay J.

25:30.290 --> 25:31.310
Oh, balls!

25:35.426 --> 25:38.243
Freds, you gotta get down here!
We've gone to Nine.

25:38.363 --> 25:39.815
- <i>Nine?</i>
- Affirmative.

25:39.935 --> 25:41.742
It's a Niner. Code Red.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.932
- He's going in.
- <i>Stop him, JJ. Stop him!</i>

25:54.811 --> 25:55.811
Result.

26:00.562 --> 26:02.870
- Oh, God...
- Dump her in here! Dump her in here!

26:06.858 --> 26:08.110
Shit! Fuck!

26:09.945 --> 26:11.150
That was so...

26:11.864 --> 26:13.202
So fun.

26:22.365 --> 26:23.645
Is she breathing?

26:27.297 --> 26:28.297
Safe.

26:39.577 --> 26:40.577
Oh, man!

26:43.146 --> 26:45.230
- Panda, come on! Let me in.
- Go away!

26:45.401 --> 26:46.541
It was a joke.

26:46.661 --> 26:48.104
It wasn't even me!

26:49.477 --> 26:51.072
You always bog everything up!

26:51.192 --> 26:53.884
It's always you!
You do everything you like

26:54.004 --> 26:56.950
just because you're depressed cos
your mum's getting wacked up the pants!

26:57.070 --> 26:58.670
Well, bogging bog off!

26:58.841 --> 27:02.469
This is my party and I'm upset
because my boyfriend got deported

27:03.107 --> 27:05.421
and you're supposed to be playing
and eating jelly

27:05.601 --> 27:07.499
and playing Twister at my party

27:07.820 --> 27:10.948
and telling me how to pop my cherry
with my boyfriend...!

27:11.068 --> 27:13.030
Christ's sake, I'll show you
how to do a blowjob.

27:13.201 --> 27:14.639
I don't want a blowjob.

27:14.759 --> 27:16.404
I want my boyfriend back!

27:21.950 --> 27:23.100
I was just...

27:27.210 --> 27:28.310
She's upset.

27:29.261 --> 27:30.550
Do I ever get to be upset?

27:31.397 --> 27:33.534
Do I ever get to be anyone but me?!

27:35.118 --> 27:37.070
- Fuck off!
- Wait. Effy, just...

27:40.303 --> 27:41.469
For Christ's sake!

27:45.086 --> 27:46.550
Get Cook out. Don't get arrested.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.630
They will not be naked.
I'm going in.

27:54.082 --> 27:55.270
Where you going?

27:55.879 --> 27:57.405
Wine. I want wine.

27:58.524 --> 27:59.874
Hurry up with it!

28:00.801 --> 28:01.965
Get beer, lezzer!

28:02.085 --> 28:04.499
All right, all right!
Keep your vagina on.

28:17.774 --> 28:19.475
So... What do you want, Ems?

28:19.595 --> 28:21.540
Pinot Grigio, or...

28:22.983 --> 28:24.322
cider oblivion?

28:24.966 --> 28:26.016
Anything...

28:27.415 --> 28:29.104
Just give me a fucking...

28:31.811 --> 28:33.432
Just... Just give me a...

28:52.926 --> 28:54.611
It's only the drugs, right?

29:15.851 --> 29:17.101
You liked that.

29:22.481 --> 29:23.478
You're gay.

29:35.229 --> 29:38.412
Oh, my giddy, giddy, giddy...

29:40.426 --> 29:41.426
aunt!

30:27.096 --> 30:28.204
Shit.

30:34.637 --> 30:37.590
Where are you, girl?
Which fucking house, girl?

30:42.624 --> 30:44.207
What's going on, kidder?

30:44.441 --> 30:45.391
The lads!

30:48.177 --> 30:49.085
Shit.

30:49.205 --> 30:51.301
Pyjama party, check it out, lads.

30:52.197 --> 30:53.030
Nice one!

30:53.241 --> 30:55.333
You're not meant
to be here, remember?

30:55.453 --> 30:58.030
Come on. Have a heart.
We lost 7-0 again, innit?

30:58.428 --> 31:00.030
You know the lads... Tommo...

31:00.662 --> 31:02.710
Marco... How you doing, man?

31:02.921 --> 31:05.631
Jonno... Sambo... Keeno...

31:06.161 --> 31:07.110
Danno...

31:08.168 --> 31:09.070
Paedo!

31:09.891 --> 31:11.055
Nice...!

31:29.717 --> 31:30.717
Sorry.

31:44.199 --> 31:46.677
The fucking door's
locked itself, hasn't it?

32:01.532 --> 32:03.950
- You should've pulled.
- I will now, won't I?

32:06.194 --> 32:08.185
Is this the cupboard
for mindless sex?

32:09.258 --> 32:11.643
You don't give a fuck
about anything, do you?

32:32.660 --> 32:33.660
Go away.

32:34.833 --> 32:35.833
Go away.

32:39.274 --> 32:40.319
Please.

32:41.299 --> 32:42.680
I want my boyfriend.

32:47.096 --> 32:48.096
Wait.

32:48.298 --> 32:50.065
Hang on. Don't push.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.470
- I wanna...
- Wait! There's something here.

32:58.023 --> 32:59.770
What the fuck?

33:04.270 --> 33:05.528
What's going on?

33:08.884 --> 33:09.884
Are we...?

33:12.690 --> 33:14.040
Are we next door?

33:21.342 --> 33:22.882
We're next door.

33:39.796 --> 33:41.830
<i>Hello. I'm Martin.</i>

33:43.264 --> 33:44.832
<i>This is Angela.</i>

33:47.874 --> 33:50.208
<i>And this is how we have sex.</i>

34:01.332 --> 34:03.535
<i>- That's lovely, Angela.
- Thank you, Martin.</i>

34:03.655 --> 34:06.139
<i>- Could you rub a little bit harder?
- Certainly.</i>

34:15.802 --> 34:17.143
You! Yes, you.

34:17.492 --> 34:19.190
I've called the police, you know?

34:19.400 --> 34:21.724
I'll be giving Angela a report
when she gets back.

34:21.844 --> 34:22.884
Right.

34:23.193 --> 34:25.121
It's nearly nine o'clock...
Disgusting.

34:25.242 --> 34:27.965
Absolutely shocking,
what you kids get up to.

34:35.349 --> 34:36.349
Shocking!

35:00.257 --> 35:03.150
Throw me through the ceiling!
Throw me through the fucking ceiling!

35:16.664 --> 35:18.256
Got locked on, Freds.

35:18.376 --> 35:20.030
It's gone to a 12... easy.

35:21.066 --> 35:22.963
It's all right. It's all right.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.753
Come on. We're gonna leave, come on.

35:26.873 --> 35:28.399
Yeah? All right?

35:35.599 --> 35:37.695
I didn't want to leave without him.

35:39.293 --> 35:41.957
It's an international incident.
I thought he was gonna...

35:42.268 --> 35:45.142
- I didn't want to leave without him.
- Fuck him, JJ.

35:48.374 --> 35:49.374
You came.

35:53.567 --> 35:56.110
JJ gets locked on.
You have to look after him.

35:57.343 --> 35:58.610
I thought Cook...

35:58.999 --> 36:00.150
Cook's his friend.

36:00.614 --> 36:02.830
I think Cook's your friend,
isn't he?

36:04.619 --> 36:05.919
Not necessarily.

36:10.714 --> 36:12.390
You'll never guess
what Pandora's Mum...

36:12.641 --> 36:13.913
We're going home, Eff.

36:14.992 --> 36:16.292
Where's Pandora?

36:19.624 --> 36:20.624
Come on.

36:24.627 --> 36:26.861
I didn't mean to fuck everything up.

36:27.969 --> 36:29.439
My parents are splitting up.

36:30.352 --> 36:31.352
I'm sorry.

36:33.599 --> 36:34.799
I got trashed.

36:39.038 --> 36:40.471
I'm sorry about that.

36:41.537 --> 36:42.537
It's shit.

38:03.091 --> 38:04.441
All right, Panda?

38:08.697 --> 38:11.679
We're the last ones standing.
No-one's got any stamina these days.

38:12.122 --> 38:13.461
Right.
Whizzer.

38:24.195 --> 38:25.922
I wanted to play Twister...

38:26.301 --> 38:28.902
and then the girls were gonna
tell me how to do sex.

38:30.001 --> 38:31.001
Bummer.

38:32.769 --> 38:34.362
How do you do it, anyway?

38:34.778 --> 38:36.869
You know, you've done loads of sex.

38:37.735 --> 38:38.835
No, Twister.

38:40.811 --> 38:42.359
Well, you spin the dial...

38:42.675 --> 38:45.439
and then you put your hands
and feet where it tells you.

38:45.610 --> 38:46.744
Hand, there.

38:47.217 --> 38:48.691
Right. Now me.

38:51.253 --> 38:52.253
Over here.

38:52.559 --> 38:55.771
You gotta move that and that.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.240
That!

39:11.821 --> 39:14.422
Okay, put your hand on yellow.
Is it on there?

39:32.360 --> 39:33.755
Do you want me to show you?

39:35.983 --> 39:36.983
What?

39:37.771 --> 39:38.821
You know...

41:31.796 --> 41:33.492
You really are beautiful.

41:37.619 --> 41:38.919
So are you, Mum.

41:41.573 --> 41:42.923
I wanted to be...

41:45.103 --> 41:46.303
one more time.

42:39.847 --> 42:40.997
See ya later.

43:00.055 --> 43:01.055
Any good?

43:01.455 --> 43:02.820
I don't know what you mean.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.467
I mean he's a sensational fuck,
yeah?

43:06.546 --> 43:09.420
There's a lot of things
you don't know about me, Eff.

43:09.540 --> 43:11.735
Just cos I'm useless,
don't mean I'm nothing.

43:11.855 --> 43:15.359
We're friends because you don't
surf-and-turf my men. You said that.

43:15.479 --> 43:18.239
He's not yours, Eff.
He'll never belong to anyone.

43:18.456 --> 43:20.487
- Shut up.
- That's why you don't really want him.

43:20.607 --> 43:22.298
- He's not the one you want.
- Shut up!

43:22.418 --> 43:24.321
I know that because I'm your friend.

43:24.672 --> 43:26.748
But you don't make
enough effort, Eff.

43:26.921 --> 43:28.426
I'm just there to laugh at.

43:28.926 --> 43:30.326
You don't know me.

43:31.712 --> 43:32.712
My life.

43:33.236 --> 43:35.087
My family. My Mum.

43:35.933 --> 43:37.867
Why don't you know anything
about my Mum?

43:37.987 --> 43:39.792
I know everything about yours.

43:44.738 --> 43:45.738
You're right.

43:47.363 --> 43:49.323
I don't know anything
about your Mum.

43:51.009 --> 43:52.009
I'm sorry.

44:02.309 --> 44:03.309
Jesus...

44:03.996 --> 44:04.897
What?

44:05.747 --> 44:07.148
Careful what you wish for.

44:07.812 --> 44:08.812
Why?

44:16.642 --> 44:17.892
Look, I'm here!

44:22.113 --> 44:24.658
It's me.
Are you not glad to see me?

44:26.422 --> 44:27.971
Mother said I could come back.

44:31.529 --> 44:32.600
What's wrong?

44:34.020 --> 44:35.578
Don't be a twat, Thomas.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.237
Give your girlfriend a hug.

44:46.647 --> 44:47.802
I missed you...

44:49.773 --> 44:51.238
I missed you too much.

44:54.943 --> 44:55.943
It's okay.

44:56.523 --> 44:57.873
Everything is okay.

44:58.401 --> 44:59.658
Everything is A1.
