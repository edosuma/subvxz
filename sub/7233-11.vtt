09:40.420 --> 09:41.160
LILY: Huh?

09:41.160 --> 09:41.860
Peter!

09:44.760 --> 09:45.740
BENJAMIN: Whoa!

09:45.740 --> 09:46.640
LILY: What's going on?

09:46.640 --> 09:49.130
BENJAMIN: Oh, you
were right, Lily.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.010
You do have to be alert,
and be patient, and careful

09:52.010 --> 09:53.490
when you're egg-sitting.

09:53.490 --> 09:54.190
Come on.

10:08.370 --> 10:11.070
PETER RABBIT: Stop, stop.

10:11.070 --> 10:19.680
Everyone, move back
very, very slowly.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.870
It was my job to
look after the egg,

10:22.870 --> 10:24.110
and that's what I'm going to do.

10:27.310 --> 10:29.140
Nearly there.

10:29.140 --> 10:32.590
Stages can't get any worse.

10:32.590 --> 10:33.950
Rain?

10:33.950 --> 10:35.890
CROWD: Whoa!

10:35.890 --> 10:37.350
Oh no!

10:37.350 --> 10:38.800
Peter!

10:38.800 --> 10:40.740
No!

10:40.740 --> 10:42.950
Yeah!

10:42.950 --> 10:43.650
Woohoo!

10:43.650 --> 10:45.110
Yay, Peter!

10:45.110 --> 10:46.550
BENJAMIN: Wow!

10:46.550 --> 10:47.980
I wasn't worried.

10:47.980 --> 10:51.850
I knew you'd use
my dad's umbrella.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.420
LILY: I take it back, Peter.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.300
You are brilliant egg-sitter.

10:56.300 --> 10:59.120
PETER RABBIT: Thanks!

10:59.120 --> 11:01.450
Now, time we got this egg back.

11:01.450 --> 11:05.630
BENJAMIN: And it keeps
the rain off too.

11:05.630 --> 11:06.330
Whoa!

11:09.210 --> 11:11.020
MRS. PUDDLE-DUCK:
Thank you, Peter.

11:11.020 --> 11:12.550
Thank you, thank you!

11:12.550 --> 11:15.350
What a helpful rabbit you are.

11:15.350 --> 11:17.060
PETER RABBIT: Any
time, Mrs. Puddle-duck.

11:17.060 --> 11:18.220
MRS. PUDDLE-DUCK: Any time?

11:18.220 --> 11:19.670
Oh, that's wonderful!

11:19.670 --> 11:21.240
That's splendid.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.660
I do need one more teeny
tiny little favour.

11:23.660 --> 11:25.110
PETER RABBIT: Well, I--

11:25.110 --> 11:27.270
MRS. PUDDLE-DUCK: I have to
run to Mrs. Tiggly-Winkle's.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.210
If you could just look
after something else for me.

11:30.210 --> 11:31.410
PETER RABBIT: Um

11:31.410 --> 11:33.210
BENJAMIN: Don't worry, Peter.

11:33.210 --> 11:36.810
I'll help just as
soon as I get down.

11:36.810 --> 11:38.010
[LAUGHTER]

11:38.010 --> 11:39.480
Whoa!

11:39.480 --> 11:40.410
[THEME -- STUART KOLLMORGEN]

11:40.410 --> 11:41.610
(SINGING) Peter Rabbit.

11:44.610 --> 11:45.510
Peter Rabbit.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.910
Peter Rabbit.

11:53.910 --> 11:55.710
Peter Rabbit.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.860
Peter Rabbit.
