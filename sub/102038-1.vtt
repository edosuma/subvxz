I'm not no rapper though.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.214
But... The hell,
I could do it.

09:43.317 --> 09:47.586
Oh.
- Yo. Tuck your chain, yo.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.155
Anyway, what about going
to see them dudes strip?

09:50.190 --> 09:52.324
Yeah!
- Oh, girl, hell no!

09:52.359 --> 09:54.826
I already told you, I'm not down
for that nonsense. No.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.495
- Oh, my god, come on!
It's gonna be fun!

09:57.531 --> 10:00.231
My sister went last week.
She was like, "yo,

10:00.334 --> 10:03.001
I could see everything!"
and when she said everything,

10:03.036 --> 10:05.103
she's talkin' about...

10:05.205 --> 10:06.805
Everything!
- Look, no!

10:06.840 --> 10:09.107
I am a christian.
I was raised in the church.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.842
I'm not tryin' to go
to hell messin' with

10:10.877 --> 10:13.278
your heathen ass.
- You not! Just relax!

10:13.380 --> 10:15.847
Be loose! Have fun!

10:15.882 --> 10:18.617
(upbeat music)

10:18.719 --> 10:20.952
Ha ha!
(cheering)

10:21.054 --> 10:23.054
(purring)

10:27.394 --> 10:29.794

10:29.896 --> 10:32.731

10:32.766 --> 10:35.300

All the way from africa,

10:39.373 --> 10:42.140
- Ooh, we about

10:42.242 --> 10:44.342

- Would you stop--ooh!

10:48.248 --> 10:51.483
- He's coming for you.
- Ooh, girl, let it happen!

10:52.552 --> 10:54.486
This skirt is short,
and this man messin' around

10:54.588 --> 10:57.288
to get me pregnant. No, no, no.

10:57.391 --> 11:00.191
No...

11:03.063 --> 11:05.830
Oh, my god! Cheryl!

11:05.932 --> 11:08.900
Everyone can see my booty!
Oh, my god!

11:08.935 --> 11:11.102
- Get it, sandy!

11:12.105 --> 11:14.939
(indistinct shouting)

11:14.975 --> 11:16.541

11:16.576 --> 11:18.510
(laughing)

11:18.612 --> 11:20.845

11:23.283 --> 11:25.517
He gon' get you pregnant, girl!

11:25.619 --> 11:27.719
(cheryl and sandy laughing)

11:27.754 --> 11:30.221
- girl, I'm telling you,
crazy stuff like that

11:30.257 --> 11:33.091
always happen to me.
- I know why:

11:33.126 --> 11:36.227
'cause your ass is
straight buck wild.

11:36.263 --> 11:37.929
And you wanna be a psychiatrist?

11:37.964 --> 11:40.365
- You're damn right!
Believe it or not,

11:40.467 --> 11:42.200
I'm actually
very good at solving

11:42.302 --> 11:43.935
other people's problems.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.438
And I can see into the future.
I've been able to do that

11:46.473 --> 11:48.707
since I was young.
- You mean like psychic?

11:48.809 --> 11:52.377
- Exactly. I just don't know
how to solve my own problems.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.679
- Heh! I hear that.
I'm the same way.

11:54.781 --> 11:57.982
- The door open?
- But I ain't trying
to be a psychiatrist.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.920
So I see the hole in your floor
has gotten bigger.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.355
- Girl, so what? That ain't
nothin' but a reverse skylight.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.291
- So you're not
gonna address it?

12:06.326 --> 12:09.527
- No, I'm not!
That's character. I like it.

12:09.629 --> 12:12.097
(hip hop music)

12:14.000 --> 12:15.834
- ♪ get big, come on ♪

12:15.869 --> 12:18.002
- so what you tryin' to do?

12:18.038 --> 12:20.305
- Truthfully,
I don't have no idea.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.240
I mean, the only reason
why I enrolled in college

12:22.342 --> 12:24.109
was to make my parents happy.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.377
Most days, I don't
even go to class.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.446
- See, that would never fly
in my family.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.582
We jamaican. I got one sister

12:30.684 --> 12:33.451
that's a lawyer. I got another
sister that's a geologist.

12:33.487 --> 12:36.321
If you a denton,
you gotta make it happen.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.824
Yo, when I was 17,
my dad passed away.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.294
- Oh, really?
Girl, I'm really sorry.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.463
- I was messed up for a while.

12:45.499 --> 12:49.134
I started cuttin' myself
with a razor blade. It was bad.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.504
When he was alive,
my grades wasn't...

12:52.539 --> 12:56.107
Up to his expectations,
you know what I'm sayin'?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.709
I disappointed him.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.512
And that's why I made a promise
to myself that no matter what,

13:00.547 --> 13:03.481
I'd make something
out of myself.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.318
Anyway, hurby know
where you went tonight?

13:07.354 --> 13:09.487
- Girl, no! And don't you
tell him either!

13:09.523 --> 13:12.257
- I'm not! So he must be like,

13:12.359 --> 13:15.293
the jealous type?
(both laughing)

13:15.395 --> 13:18.830
so what you think? Y'all gonna
get married, have kids?

13:18.865 --> 13:21.232
- I don't know! I mean...

13:21.268 --> 13:23.134
I'd be lying if I said I ain't
thought about it once

13:23.236 --> 13:26.337
or twice.
- Mm-hmm.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.973
- You know, one thing
I really love about him is

13:29.075 --> 13:30.608
he believes
that he could do anything.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.178
And he makes me believe
that I can too.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.482
- I mean, it don't hurt
that he's cute.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.618
He corny...
- (both): ...But he cute!

13:40.720 --> 13:43.822
- Yeah, he is.
(both laughing)

13:43.924 --> 13:46.558

(loud music from other car)

13:46.593 --> 13:48.393
oh, I know

13:48.428 --> 13:50.161

13:52.632 --> 13:55.834

13:55.936 --> 13:59.170

14:01.942 --> 14:03.341

14:05.412 --> 14:07.579

14:07.614 --> 14:11.082

14:11.117 --> 14:14.118

14:14.154 --> 14:17.188

14:57.497 --> 15:00.531

Hip hop is all about attitude,

16:59.119 --> 17:01.252
- Here, let me explain
something to you.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.988
Every time I stop the tape,
that's wasted tape.

17:04.090 --> 17:06.090
That's wasted time.
That's wasted money.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.726
You understand?
Don't look ahead.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.529
Just say the words that I wrote.
And can you please,

17:11.631 --> 17:14.065

17:14.100 --> 17:17.301
I mean, cheryl can do it.
Why can't you?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.903
- I ain't cheryl.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.773
And I already told you
that I wasn't no rapper.

17:21.808 --> 17:24.008
We ain't even getting
paid to do this, yo.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.411
(sandy sighs)

17:27.981 --> 17:30.114
yo, a negro take
one little music class

17:30.150 --> 17:32.884
and he think he barry gordy.
- Excuse me, what was that?

17:32.986 --> 17:34.018
- What?

17:34.154 --> 17:36.054
- Hey, guys, can we
just chill out for a second?

17:36.156 --> 17:38.389
We got a lot of work
ahead of us.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.925
- Yeah, you better
talk to your man.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.228
- Ugh. Hold on.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.766
Can you please be
a little patient with her?

17:50.336 --> 17:52.103
- I don't know
if this gonna work out.

17:52.138 --> 17:54.505
- This is new to all of us.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.241
- Ahem!

17:57.343 --> 18:00.011
- See what I'm saying?

18:01.981 --> 18:04.582
(exhales sharply)
(people laughing)

18:04.684 --> 18:06.751
- I'm so damn sick
of not having money,

18:06.853 --> 18:08.619
I don't even know what to do!

18:08.655 --> 18:10.555
'cause see,
when a man got money,

18:10.657 --> 18:12.857
he can do things
that a broke man can't do.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.592
(indistinct murmuring)
for example,

18:14.694 --> 18:18.329
when a man got money, he could
tell his lady something like...

18:18.364 --> 18:20.465
Shut the hell up!
(laughing)

18:20.500 --> 18:23.367
and she'll shut up, won't she?
So, what do y'all think?

18:23.403 --> 18:26.270
Is it good?
- Martin, you hilarious! Ha ha!

18:26.372 --> 18:28.906
What you think? He funny, right?
- I'd keep working on it.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.776
- Helen, helen, helen.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.812
(indistinct murmuring)

18:37.851 --> 18:40.718
- so, is it the refrigerator
or the stove?

18:40.753 --> 18:44.355
Just... You can let me know
if you're interested or not.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.724
- Ladies, would you
come with me, please?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.993
I'd like to see you
in my office.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.497
(phones ringing)

18:52.532 --> 18:54.665
(indistinct chattering)

18:59.072 --> 19:02.640
- (man): Mm, mm, mm...

19:03.409 --> 19:04.742
- Mm.

19:04.777 --> 19:07.345
- Ooh! Y'all in trouble!

to reward hard workers,

19:24.597 --> 19:26.697

How does that sound?
- Hold up. Wait. So we gettin'

19:28.768 --> 19:30.067

19:30.103 --> 19:31.669

28:24.670 --> 28:27.271
- Yo, one thing.
No more paisleys

28:27.406 --> 28:29.273
and heels, yo. You know
I almost busted my ass

28:29.408 --> 28:31.809
up on that stage.
- What, you don't like the suit?

28:31.844 --> 28:34.178
Hey, don't worry about it.
I'll take you guys shopping.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.946
Whatever you want,

28:36.082 --> 28:38.615

28:38.751 --> 28:40.284

28:40.419 --> 28:42.653
You know what? I'm sweet tooth.
Got a taste for talent.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.788
Y'all headed straight
to the top. Get in close.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.824
I wanna take a picture before

28:46.926 --> 28:49.193
Come on, close, man!
She gon' be a problem.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.195
Ol' salty right here.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.997
Say cheddar for me.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.300

29:09.081 --> 29:10.481

not pay me to leave

29:10.583 --> 29:13.550

- Bro, do you hear your voice?

29:13.586 --> 29:15.552
You need to be home in bed
or we're never gonna be ready

29:15.588 --> 29:18.322

- Uh-uh. Every rapper I ever

29:18.424 --> 29:21.058
wanted to meet is

29:21.093 --> 29:23.827
Especially that one.
- He was

29:23.929 --> 29:26.530
barely in the movie.
How old is he, like 17?

29:26.632 --> 29:28.398
- Bro, do not mess this up
for me tonight!

29:28.434 --> 29:31.168
I asked around,
and I know his name.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.503
It's ll cool j.

29:32.638 --> 29:35.372
And I'm takin' his young ass
home with me tonight.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.441
- All right, well, go talk
to him. See if he like girls

29:37.476 --> 29:40.344
that sound like that.
- What I wanna do is just put

29:40.479 --> 29:43.447
my vibe out there,
and he gonna come over to me.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.549
- All right.
Let's see the vibe, then.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.285
Work it, sandy!

29:48.320 --> 29:50.387
Boom! Yeah.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.256
I'm gonna need some more
champagne and I'm gonna go find

29:52.291 --> 29:54.858
my man. Good luck with the vibe.
- You don't like the vibe

29:54.960 --> 29:57.227
that I'm throwin' out?
- Dj, dj!

29:57.329 --> 29:59.630
- Uh-huh, uh-huh!

29:59.665 --> 30:02.366

30:02.501 --> 30:05.169
(upbeat hip hop music playing)

30:10.342 --> 30:12.643
- hey, mr. Love bug!

30:12.678 --> 30:14.978
- You ok, sweetheart?

30:15.014 --> 30:18.048
- Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
Got a little cold.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.983
- Stay away from me then.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.453
(man chuckles)
how you doin', love? I'm markie.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.389
- I know who you are.
I love the fat boys.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.392
I'm sandy.
- So what'd you
think of the movie?

30:28.494 --> 30:30.427
- I thought you did good.

30:30.529 --> 30:33.063
How was it seeing yourself
on the big screen?

30:33.199 --> 30:36.133
- Pretty crazy to be honest.
Had to pinch myself a few times.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.836
I sure never thought rappin'
would get me here. Keep doin'

30:38.871 --> 30:40.671
what you're doin'.
You'll get there too one day.

30:40.706 --> 30:44.241
- How you know who I am?
- I asked around. And...

30:44.376 --> 30:46.777
Your name is on the back of
your jacket. It's kind of hard

30:46.812 --> 30:49.513
to miss. I want
you to get better

30:49.548 --> 30:51.849
'cause when you do,
I wanna take you out.

30:51.884 --> 30:54.251
- That's sweet.
- So is that a yes?

30:54.386 --> 30:55.853
(cheering)

30:55.888 --> 30:59.189
- why your girl always movin'
around like a groupie?

30:59.225 --> 31:01.692
Lookin' cheap.
- Hurby! That's markie

31:01.727 --> 31:04.528
of the fat boys.
Yo, she's just talkin'.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.296
Ok? Relax.

31:06.332 --> 31:09.066
Let's enjoy this, please?
- All right. All right.

31:12.338 --> 31:15.339
Sic)
(elevator bell dings)

31:17.443 --> 31:18.876
ok.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.011
I asked all around.
No one's interested in signin'

31:21.146 --> 31:24.314
a girls' rap group.
This guy might be our shot.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.117
(phone ringing)

31:27.152 --> 31:29.186
(hurby sighs)

31:29.288 --> 31:31.388
hurby azor, here to meet
eddie o'loughlin.

31:31.490 --> 31:34.191
<i> Thanks for meeting with us,</i>
<i> mr. O'loughlin.</i>

31:34.326 --> 31:37.094
- Just call me eddie o.
So your song's

31:37.129 --> 31:40.964
gettin' a little bit of play.
Since bls broke it...

31:41.000 --> 31:43.233
It's gettin' added.
Philly, d.C.,

31:43.335 --> 31:45.135
cleveland. You know,
I've been thinking

31:45.170 --> 31:48.906
of maybe taking a chance
on a female rap act but...

31:49.008 --> 31:51.375
I don't know.
- Well, if you liked

31:51.510 --> 31:53.810
"showstopper," I can deliver
a full album that's even hotter.

31:53.846 --> 31:55.746
Speaking of d.C.,
they got a style of music

31:55.848 --> 31:58.849
down there called go-go that I
think would sound so funky

31:58.884 --> 32:01.551
under a rap song. I got
100 ideas. That's just one.

32:01.654 --> 32:04.087
- That's great to hear but,
you know, as you can see,

32:04.189 --> 32:07.157
we're a small label and I don't
really have a big budget.

32:07.192 --> 32:10.260
- Fine with me.
I work fast and cheap.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.062
- Ahem.

32:12.197 --> 32:15.232
- I couldn't do this without
cheryl. She's my inspiration.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.234
(distant phone ringing)
(distant honking)

32:18.871 --> 32:21.071
- tell you what. I'll give you

32:21.206 --> 32:24.007
five grand for another single.
If it comes out well,

32:24.043 --> 32:26.076
I'll give you nine grand more

32:26.211 --> 32:28.312
for a full lp.

32:28.347 --> 32:31.214
Deal?

32:32.584 --> 32:34.685
- Ho ho ho!
(laughing)

32:34.720 --> 32:37.087
donations for
the children's hospital!

32:37.189 --> 32:39.856
- Ah! $14 000!

32:39.892 --> 32:42.926
Are you kiddin' me? I'm gonna
make five albums with that!

32:43.062 --> 32:45.262
- I am buggin'!
This don't even seem real!

32:45.364 --> 32:47.931
I need to find a pay phone
and call sandy right now!

32:48.033 --> 32:50.300
- Whoa! Whoa! Slow down, baby.
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.

32:50.402 --> 32:53.103
- What?
- There's something
we need to talk about.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.972
There's a reason
why I didn't invite her

32:55.007 --> 32:57.040
to this meeting.
- Ok.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.109
- The two of us...

32:59.211 --> 33:00.844
We're the group.

33:00.879 --> 33:02.813
We're the creative team.

33:02.915 --> 33:05.115
The way I look at it,
sandra's just a supporting role

33:05.217 --> 33:07.484
in all this.
- Supporting how? What does

33:07.586 --> 33:10.520
that even mean?
- What I'm saying. I mean,

33:10.556 --> 33:12.489
I'm doin' all the writing
and the producing.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.025
You do most of the rappin'.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.327
She's just there
to complete the picture.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.029
- I can't believe
you're saying this!

33:19.064 --> 33:20.630
Sandy's my girl.
I always figured we would

33:20.766 --> 33:23.734
split it three ways.
- What are you saying, cher?

33:23.769 --> 33:25.502
Why would we do that?

33:25.604 --> 33:28.672
It was my vision
that got us here.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.674
You know what I'm saying?
I'm creating

33:30.776 --> 33:33.777
most of the record.
I'm doin' all of the work.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.979
Why... Why wouldn't I get
a bigger share?

33:36.115 --> 33:38.048
- I mean yeah, I get it.
That makes sense.

33:38.083 --> 33:41.351
- Yeah! And since you're doing
most of the rapping...

33:41.453 --> 33:43.553
Why should she get paid
as much as you do?

33:43.589 --> 33:45.989
(honking)
(indistinct chatter)

33:46.125 --> 33:49.593
cher, baby...

33:49.628 --> 33:52.429
I'm not telling you
what to do with your money.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.731
And I know this is
your girl and all.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.434
If you wanna split it
down the middle with her,

33:57.469 --> 33:59.269
that's on you.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.905
- It just wouldn't even feel
right taking more than her.

34:01.940 --> 34:04.341
Your voice didn't work
with mine, remember?

34:04.443 --> 34:06.309
She make this group work.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.147
- Like I said,
it's on you, baby.

34:16.488 --> 34:18.722
- What are you doin'?

34:18.824 --> 34:20.090
- What's it look like I'm doin'?

34:20.125 --> 34:21.958
I'm hailin' a cab!

34:21.994 --> 34:24.227
We make too much money
to ride the subway now!

34:24.329 --> 34:26.797
(sandy laughs)
let's go!

34:26.832 --> 34:29.099
(hip hop-style christmas music)

34:36.008 --> 34:38.341
- yeah.
- (markie): [and?]

34:38.377 --> 34:40.510
- I mean, I don't know.
That's a big step.

34:40.546 --> 34:43.246
I only been talking to you
for like a month.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.615
(doorbell rings)
baby, hold on one second, ok?

34:51.190 --> 34:53.723
- Girl, I got some news!
- I'm on the phone! What's up?!

34:53.826 --> 34:57.260
- Hang up! This is important!
- Ah! Hey, baby. Yes.

34:57.362 --> 35:00.130
I'm gonna call you
back tonight. Ok? Yeah.

35:00.165 --> 35:02.732
All right. Bye.

35:02.868 --> 35:06.069
- Sandy, you not gonna believe
what's going on, girl!

35:06.171 --> 35:07.604
(sucks teeth)

35:07.706 --> 35:10.307
- anyway, she on my nerves.
- Well, all that's

35:10.342 --> 35:13.343
about to change.
We got a record deal!

35:13.378 --> 35:16.246
- You lyin'.
- I'm serious.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.782
- You serious?

35:18.817 --> 35:21.017
So what do we do next?!

35:21.053 --> 35:23.920
What we gotta sign? How
much money we gettin'?
Are we gonna move?!

35:24.022 --> 35:26.523
- Sandy, listen!
I don't know all that yet.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.592
But what I do know is, yo,
we gotta take this seriously

35:28.694 --> 35:31.628
and give it 100 percent.
Like, this is our life now.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.297
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'm droppin' out of school.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.833
- Word?
- Yeah, and you should too.

35:36.869 --> 35:40.270
- Nah. The one thing
I promised my dad is that I was

35:40.372 --> 35:42.539
going to get my education
and I gotta get it, yo.

35:42.574 --> 35:45.542
I can't quit school...

35:46.879 --> 35:48.612
...But I can take
a semester off.

35:48.714 --> 35:51.214
But I can't drop out!
But we definitely

35:51.250 --> 35:53.316
quittin' sears!
- Yeah!

35:53.352 --> 35:55.185
- What's everybody
shoutin' about? You know

35:55.220 --> 35:58.188
I'm trying to watch me stories.
- Cheryl just told me

35:58.223 --> 36:00.323
we're gettin' a record deal.
(laughing)

36:00.425 --> 36:02.626
- I'm happy for you.

36:02.728 --> 36:05.896
Come love me up.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.031
Oh, I hope you know
what you're doing.

36:08.066 --> 36:10.333
- Yeah, mommy.
It's fine! It's not like

36:10.435 --> 36:13.503
I'm doin' it by myself.
I got her back. She got mine.

36:13.539 --> 36:15.639
We'll be fine.

We go on at 11.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.598
Can you let 'em know we here?
- Who do I look like,

boo boo the fool?
This ain't salt-n-pepa.

36:45.137 --> 36:47.204
Salt-n-pepa are already here.
They got here an hour ago.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.040
- The hell you talkin' about,
man? This is the group!

36:50.142 --> 36:51.741
Yo, you must be confused.
Talk to your people.

36:51.777 --> 36:55.178

I said the group's already here.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.181
So you, laverne
and shirley here can go

36:58.283 --> 37:00.383

- No. Look, negro.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.252

37:15.500 --> 37:17.300
- Yo, it's sweet tooth
and lamont.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.436
It's these two dudes
I talked to about comin' on

37:19.471 --> 37:21.605
as managers, but they asked
for too much money

37:21.640 --> 37:24.641
so I told 'em to step.
- What?!

37:24.676 --> 37:27.577
- I think they brought in fake
salt-n-pepas to steal our gig!

37:27.679 --> 37:30.547
- What? Fake salt-n-pepa?

37:30.649 --> 37:32.983

39:45.650 --> 39:48.451
How that taste, hurby? Whoa!

39:48.487 --> 39:50.787
- Yo! Get the hell up
off my man!

39:50.822 --> 39:53.056
- You better back up 'cause I
been waiting to shake your salt.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.859
- Yeah, right.
I'm from brooklyn.
I'll beat both your asses.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.062
- Hey! Muzzle this mutt.
- Ah!

39:59.164 --> 40:02.699
(high-pitched tone ringing)
- you asked for this, hurby!

40:02.801 --> 40:04.968
(tense music)

40:07.906 --> 40:11.174
- listen, what happened was
completely foul.

40:11.209 --> 40:14.043
I shouldn't have been dealing
with those ghetto hustlers.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.812
I apologize.
- Yeah, that's what happens

40:15.947 --> 40:18.748
when you deal with pimps.
They gon' treat you like a ho.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.186
- Yo, we been
too focused on the show.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.054
We need to be
about this business.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.357
That's why I brought in
my man j.P.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.759
He's gonna be handlin'
all of the logistics,

40:29.795 --> 40:31.494
the promotion,
bookin' the shows,

40:31.596 --> 40:33.863
so forth and so on.
Tell 'em like you told me, j.

40:33.965 --> 40:35.899
- One of the reasons why those
dudes were able to pull off

40:35.934 --> 40:39.102
that scam is because there's
no publicity photos of you two.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.438
See, fans, they know about
the songs, but they don't know

40:41.473 --> 40:44.174
what you look like.
That changes starting now.

40:44.276 --> 40:46.576
- Yeah, and I also
trademarked our names,

40:46.611 --> 40:49.245
so anybody thinking
they gonna get over on us,

40:49.281 --> 40:51.014
we takin' their ass to court
and we suin'.

40:51.116 --> 40:54.117
You have a question, sandra?
- Yes, I do.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.219
Why were you dealin'
with them thugs anyway?

40:56.321 --> 40:58.188
- Look, I apologized.
I ain't mike tyson.

40:58.323 --> 41:01.391
- I know 'cause you was
runnin' like carl lewis

41:01.426 --> 41:03.359
I heard.
- You heard?

41:03.462 --> 41:05.628
Whatever. We're only
workin' with people

41:05.664 --> 41:08.298
we know, keepin' it in house.
That's why I brought in

41:08.333 --> 41:09.966
my brother, steve.
He's my right hand.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.868
It's only right
he handle the choreography.

41:12.003 --> 41:14.637
- I got y'all. I'm gonna have
y'all lookin' fresh.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.639
- Quick question.
Latonya, is it?

41:16.675 --> 41:19.576
- Latoya.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.478

41:21.513 --> 41:24.547

- Yeah, I was gettin' to that.

41:24.683 --> 41:26.382
I'm bringin' latoya
into the group.

41:26.518 --> 41:29.452
- Meet your new dj, spinderella.

41:29.488 --> 41:32.322
(hip hop music)

41:38.630 --> 41:40.730
(door shuts)
- yo. It's so hot.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.900
Gordon, you got anything
to drink? I'm dyin' in here!

41:44.002 --> 41:45.969
- Yeah, yeah, I think I got a
soda in the fridge or something.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.137
- No! No soda. No soda.
Have some water.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.939
- I don't want no water!
(synth track plays)

41:50.041 --> 41:52.742
- that's you?
- You already know how I do.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.677
(indistinct murmuring)

41:54.713 --> 41:56.946
- sandra, we're here to work.
I need your vocals loose.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.282
- I can't get a sip?
- No, you can't!

41:59.384 --> 42:01.784
- But I thought you said
the album was basically done.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.153
- It is, cher. It is.
All we need is a b-side

42:04.189 --> 42:07.590
for<i> tramp,</i> all right?
Gordy won't leave brooklyn

42:07.692 --> 42:10.860
and I need his keyboard sound,
so... We here.

42:10.896 --> 42:14.297
All right? Any other questions?

42:14.332 --> 42:16.132
Yo, gordy, play that synth sound
for me again. Come on.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.535
- Wait, you actually liked that?
I was just messing around, man.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.603
That's supposed to be a joke--
- come on, man. Just play it so

42:20.739 --> 42:23.873
we can finish and
get out of here.
- Ok, damn.

42:25.710 --> 42:28.611

42:28.713 --> 42:31.180

42:31.216 --> 42:32.949
Mm!

43:01.112 --> 43:02.912
Get on this, baby.
- Hurby, can we just take

43:02.948 --> 43:04.747

for a second?

43:04.783 --> 43:07.317
- No! I need y'all
to get in the booth,

43:07.452 --> 43:09.185

43:09.220 --> 43:12.755

You know that. So that's what

She can't mix, she can't

44:18.657 --> 44:20.323
Girl, I forgot my jacket.
- Hit me later.

44:20.358 --> 44:22.091
I gotta get my hair done.

- You're fine, sandy.

44:37.208 --> 44:38.841
It's supposed
to feel a little hot.

44:38.877 --> 44:40.843
- It's not supposed to feel
this hot. I knew I should've

44:40.879 --> 44:43.246
went to my own hairdresser!
(breathes heavily)

44:43.348 --> 44:45.081
- there's nothing she can do
that I can't!

44:45.216 --> 44:46.849
Ok? So stop it.
- Ooh, jean, just--no!

44:46.885 --> 44:49.085
You just wash it out!
- But the book says that--

44:49.187 --> 44:51.454
- I don't give a damn
what the book say!

44:51.489 --> 44:53.589
Wash it out!
- Ok, ok!

44:53.692 --> 44:55.525
- Turn the water on!
- But it's not gonna look right!

44:55.560 --> 44:57.460
- I don't care! Hoo!

44:57.562 --> 44:59.328
Hoo! Oh!

44:59.364 --> 45:01.831
Turn it on, jean! Turn it on!

45:01.866 --> 45:05.168
Jean, put the water in it!

45:05.203 --> 45:08.204
- Uh-oh...
- Uh-oh?

45:08.239 --> 45:10.773
What you mean, uh-oh?!
- Nothin'! It's just...

45:10.909 --> 45:14.110
I think I made a little mistake.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.647
- Jean! Jean!

45:17.749 --> 45:20.049
(sandy screams)

45:20.085 --> 45:23.619
- ooh, yeah, that's
burnt all right.
- Ow! Ow!

45:23.755 --> 45:25.655
- It's not funny, cheryl! What
the hell I'm supposed to do?

45:25.690 --> 45:28.191
We got a photo shoot on Friday
and I'm gonna be over there

45:28.226 --> 45:30.126
lookin' like a idiot!
- I mean, we could always

45:30.228 --> 45:31.894
wear hats?
- I ain't wearin' no damn hat!

45:31.930 --> 45:33.830
I don't even know if my hair
can grow back right here!

45:33.865 --> 45:35.965
- Come on, it's not that bad--
- no! What, I'm gonna be walkin'

45:36.101 --> 45:38.468
around lookin' like mr. T
for the rest of my life?

45:38.570 --> 45:41.003
- Ooh! I got it. Ok. So this is
what we do. First, you dye it.

45:41.106 --> 45:42.805
Do it like
a real bright honey blonde,

45:42.941 --> 45:44.674
and then we'll fade it
and shape it up. Jean, you got

45:44.776 --> 45:46.709
some clippers? And you
know what? We'll even cut

45:46.745 --> 45:49.145
some lines in it on the side
like the guys do in brooklyn.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.247
Go real punk rock glam.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.549
You know, believe it or not,

45:53.585 --> 45:55.985
I think it could
be actually dope.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.921
- Girl, I'm so desperate,
I'll try anything right now.

45:58.957 --> 46:01.390
- Tell you what.
I'll cut your hair--

46:01.426 --> 46:02.992
- no!
- You'll cut mine.

46:03.094 --> 46:06.529
We'll have the same style.
- You'd do that for me?

46:06.564 --> 46:08.765
- Yeah. We in this
together, right?

46:08.800 --> 46:10.733
- Yeah.

46:10.769 --> 46:13.035
- I'll be on this side.
This side shaved.

46:13.138 --> 46:16.506
So we workin' it. We workin' it.
Work the camera.

46:16.608 --> 46:19.876
- Jean, why is you workin'--
get out of here!

46:19.978 --> 46:22.178
She's on my nerves!
- Ok. Focus.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.281
- Just like that. Yeah. Yeah.
Get a little closer together.

46:25.316 --> 46:27.750
Nice. Everybody got their
hair done! They lookin' good!

46:27.786 --> 46:31.521
Come on. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah,

46:31.623 --> 46:34.457
Hey, yo, get in there.

46:45.637 --> 46:47.370
How much longer we gonna wait?

46:47.472 --> 46:49.438
- Yeah, I know.
Let's give her another 10.

46:49.474 --> 46:51.474
If she's not here, we move on.

46:51.509 --> 46:53.810
- Once again,
miss thing is late.

46:53.845 --> 46:57.079
Yo, that's mad disrespectful.
- I'm aware of that, cheryl.

46:57.115 --> 46:59.415
- Are you?
'cause when pepa's late,

46:59.517 --> 47:01.083
you never let her
hear the end of it.

47:01.119 --> 47:02.785
- Never.
- Why is there one set of rules

47:02.821 --> 47:04.921
for this one and another for us?
- I mean, what you want me

47:05.023 --> 47:07.924
to do? You want
me to fire the girl?
- I ain't say all that.

47:08.026 --> 47:11.394
- But you know what? You right.
You're right. She's slackin'.

47:11.496 --> 47:14.564
It's mad disrespectful,
unprofessional.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.899
I'm gonna give her a call.
- Call her up.

47:17.001 --> 47:18.801
(sandy scoffs)

47:18.837 --> 47:21.070
(picks up phone)

47:21.206 --> 47:24.240
(line trilling)
- yeah. Where you at?

47:24.375 --> 47:27.677
You're an hour late.

47:27.712 --> 47:29.946
Well, we don't work like that.

47:29.981 --> 47:32.315
Well, stay where you are.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.116
We don't need you anymore.
- Ooh!

47:34.219 --> 47:36.185
Damn, you cut her
just like that?

47:36.221 --> 47:39.155

or a song on the charts, and you
ladies have come out of nowhere.

why I picked you for this group

56:07.698 --> 56:09.598

56:09.700 --> 56:12.368

56:20.711 --> 56:24.513

gangster and nasty.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.415
'cause what I found out is

56:26.517 --> 56:31.653
the music you make reflects
the life you live.

Understand me?

57:32.283 --> 57:33.816

Ooh! How you doin', baby?

1:09:02.672 --> 1:09:05.540
- Hi.
- Ah! Ah! Ah!

1:09:05.675 --> 1:09:08.143
Y'all done yet?
- Not yet. But, um...

1:09:08.178 --> 1:09:10.145
I wanted to talk
to you about somethin'.

1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:12.180
- Ok. Ok. What's up?
- I was tryin' to wait,

1:09:12.215 --> 1:09:15.617
but I can't wait anymore.
I just wanna... Tell you.

1:09:15.652 --> 1:09:17.752
- Ok. Yeah, what's up?

1:09:17.854 --> 1:09:20.288
- I'm pregnant.

1:09:25.862 --> 1:09:28.163
You don't have nothin' to say?

1:09:28.198 --> 1:09:29.831
- What am I supposed to say?
- I don't know. Somethin' like,

1:09:29.866 --> 1:09:32.233
baby, I'm so happy.
I can't wait to get married.

1:09:32.335 --> 1:09:34.736
I can't wait to move in.
Something like that.

1:09:34.838 --> 1:09:36.337
- You know, I figured
you were on the pill.

1:09:36.373 --> 1:09:39.974
- I'm not. And I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

1:09:40.010 --> 1:09:43.411
but newsflash: I'm gonna

1:09:43.513 --> 1:09:46.414
have your baby. Period.

1:09:46.550 --> 1:09:48.349
(soft music)

1:09:52.422 --> 1:09:54.055
- (cheryl): Oof.

1:09:54.090 --> 1:09:55.890
(men speaking indistinctly)

1:09:55.926 --> 1:09:58.593
- are you ok?
- No, I'm not.

1:09:58.628 --> 1:10:00.328
I hate doin' stuff like this.

1:10:00.463 --> 1:10:02.697
Girl...
- Cheryl, you gotta have my back

1:10:02.799 --> 1:10:05.400
up there because if they think
--hold up--if they think

1:10:05.435 --> 1:10:06.868
we're not together,
it's not gonna work.

1:10:06.970 --> 1:10:09.237
- I'm with you, girl.
I'm just a little nervous

1:10:09.272 --> 1:10:11.539
is all. You sure
you remember what to say?

1:10:11.641 --> 1:10:13.341
- I got everything memorized.
- Ok.

1:10:13.443 --> 1:10:15.109
- We got this!
- Ok.

1:10:15.145 --> 1:10:16.844
- Just chill. We got it.

1:10:16.947 --> 1:10:19.280
- So where's this
all coming from?

1:10:19.316 --> 1:10:21.950
Since when do you ladies wanna
renegotiate your deals?

1:10:21.985 --> 1:10:23.885
- Well, we've actually been

1:10:23.987 --> 1:10:25.553
thinking about it for a while.

1:10:25.655 --> 1:10:28.356
We think that now is
the right time.

1:10:28.491 --> 1:10:30.792
- Hmm. For a while, huh?

1:10:32.495 --> 1:10:34.295
- (woman): Girls, I realize
that I'm new to the team,

1:10:34.331 --> 1:10:36.631
but I gotta tell you
this is, uh...

1:10:36.666 --> 1:10:38.533
Gonna be difficult.

1:10:38.668 --> 1:10:40.969
- We'll see.

1:10:42.472 --> 1:10:45.139
(hurby sighs)
- (hurby): Cher...

1:10:45.175 --> 1:10:46.874
Talk to me.

1:10:46.977 --> 1:10:49.277
What's this really about?

1:10:55.652 --> 1:10:58.319
- It's... Like you once told us.

1:10:58.355 --> 1:11:00.455
We were so focused on the show

1:11:00.490 --> 1:11:03.157
when we needed to be
about the business.

1:11:03.193 --> 1:11:05.927
- Like cheryl said,
the bottom line is

1:11:06.029 --> 1:11:07.629
we're taking a meeting
with eddie o.

1:11:07.664 --> 1:11:09.964
And we're gonna
tell him what we want.

1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.900
Now, if y'all wanna stand
with us, that's great.

1:11:13.003 --> 1:11:16.304
And if you don't, we might have
to seek some other options.

1:11:16.339 --> 1:11:19.941
Different management.
- (hurby): Hmm.

1:11:20.043 --> 1:11:23.211
- Better management.

1:11:24.381 --> 1:11:26.981
- Is this what you want?

1:11:27.017 --> 1:11:29.584
- Yes. And it's

1:11:29.719 --> 1:11:31.653
what we're gonna get.

1:11:33.556 --> 1:11:36.758
- Ok.

1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:38.559
I guess there's
nothin' more to talk about.

1:11:40.230 --> 1:11:42.263
Let's call eddie o.

1:11:42.365 --> 1:11:43.898
(picks up phone)
(beep)

1:11:43.933 --> 1:11:47.035
- (woman): Can you put me
through to eddie o, please?

1:11:49.906 --> 1:11:52.340
(both screaming)

1:11:52.375 --> 1:11:54.175
- ooh! Ooh!
- Ooh! I'm pregnant!

1:11:54.210 --> 1:11:57.445
- Ok!
- Girl, did you see his face?

1:11:57.547 --> 1:12:00.615
(birds chirping)

1:12:03.586 --> 1:12:05.987
- you are so precious, you!

1:12:06.089 --> 1:12:07.655
Look at those little cheeks!

1:12:07.757 --> 1:12:11.025
Oh, my goodness!
Look at those cheeks!

1:12:11.061 --> 1:12:13.828
You're so sweet, you know?
- We was just droppin' by.

1:12:13.930 --> 1:12:16.731
I didn't realize
you were, um, workin'.

1:12:16.766 --> 1:12:19.701
- What's his name?
- Damon.

1:12:19.736 --> 1:12:22.770
- Little baby damon,
you are the cutest thing

1:12:22.806 --> 1:12:24.706
I've ever seen!

1:12:26.943 --> 1:12:28.710
- Steve!
- Tell her!

1:12:28.745 --> 1:12:31.579
(speaking creole)

1:12:31.614 --> 1:12:33.081
- mm, mm, mm!

1:12:33.116 --> 1:12:34.849
- Um, trina...

1:12:34.951 --> 1:12:38.152
Can you excuse us, please?
I need to talk to cheryl alone.

1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:53.401
- What the hell was that about?

1:12:53.436 --> 1:12:56.771
And don't lie.
- Cher...

1:12:56.806 --> 1:12:58.840
Damon's my son.

1:13:02.278 --> 1:13:03.911
- You know,
I knew you wasn't shit,

1:13:03.947 --> 1:13:05.913
but I never thought
that you was this low.

1:13:05.949 --> 1:13:07.682
- Hey, that happened
on our break. A'ight?

1:13:07.784 --> 1:13:10.585
- What break?! I ain't never
took no break from you!

1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:12.553
So what, that girl,
you with her now?

1:13:12.655 --> 1:13:14.555
- No! No! I'm just handlin'
my responsibilities! I mean,

1:13:14.591 --> 1:13:16.724
what else you want me to do?
- No, don't!

1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:20.428
- Cher, we can do this!
- Don't touch me!

1:13:20.463 --> 1:13:23.297
You and I are done.

1:13:23.333 --> 1:13:24.966
This is finished.
- You don't mean that.

1:13:25.001 --> 1:13:27.635
- We can still work together
only because we have a contract,

1:13:27.670 --> 1:13:30.571
but as far as you and I?

1:13:30.673 --> 1:13:32.240
That's a wrap.
Don't call my house

1:13:32.342 --> 1:13:33.941
unless it's pertaining to
salt-n-pepa, do you hear that?

1:13:33.977 --> 1:13:36.110
- You're not gonna throw away
everything we built over this

1:13:36.146 --> 1:13:38.079
little mistake?
- A little mistake?!

1:13:38.181 --> 1:13:41.048
Hurby, you kidding me?
That's a wrap.

1:13:43.019 --> 1:13:44.819
(sobs)
- cher, come on...

1:13:44.854 --> 1:13:48.489
(sniffling)

1:13:48.525 --> 1:13:49.957

1:13:52.529 --> 1:13:55.163

1:14:00.503 --> 1:14:02.570

1:14:02.672 --> 1:14:04.405
(answering machine beeps)

1:14:04.541 --> 1:14:07.608
- [cheryl, I'm in labour!
Meet me at the hospital!]

1:14:07.710 --> 1:14:10.111
[now!]
- ok. Ok.

1:14:10.146 --> 1:14:12.647
(sandy groans)
- (man): Hey, yo!

1:14:12.682 --> 1:14:14.282
B! Right here! Yo!

1:14:14.384 --> 1:14:16.951
- Oh, it's starting to hurt,
nurse! Cheryl!

1:14:16.986 --> 1:14:19.120
Have you seen
my friend, cheryl? Cheryl!

1:14:19.155 --> 1:14:21.622
- Girl, I'm right here!
I made it! And guess what?

1:14:21.724 --> 1:14:23.391
- No, no, no! Let me
tell you about tah tah!

1:14:23.426 --> 1:14:25.159
He promised me he was goin'
to come up here!

1:14:25.195 --> 1:14:27.161
He did not even come up here!
- Well, listen--

1:14:27.197 --> 1:14:28.996
- why he don't love me?
- I don't know, sandy,

1:14:29.032 --> 1:14:31.199
but guess what?
I am here, and I got you, girl.

1:14:31.234 --> 1:14:32.667
I got you, ok? I'm here.
- Yes.

1:14:32.702 --> 1:14:34.969
Miss nurse, you said
I could have more drugs.

1:14:35.071 --> 1:14:38.439
Miss nurse, can I
have them, please? Ooh! Ah!

1:14:38.541 --> 1:14:41.309
- You got it. You got it.
- Yeah.

1:14:41.344 --> 1:14:43.344
(sandy groans)
oh...

1:14:43.379 --> 1:14:46.814
Thank you.
- It's ok. Careful. Careful.

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:49.484
- What was you
tryin' to tell me?
- Girl, I did it.

1:14:49.586 --> 1:14:51.152
Girl, I finally left his ass.

1:14:51.187 --> 1:14:53.688
- Hurby?
- Yes! And listen, I know

1:14:53.723 --> 1:14:55.389
I could've left his ass
a long time ago,

1:14:55.425 --> 1:14:58.159
but he taught me everything.
I know how to do this now.

1:14:58.261 --> 1:15:01.062
- I'm so proud of you.
'cause you know he been jealous

1:15:01.097 --> 1:15:04.499
of us from the start. And it's
gonna be different now.

1:15:04.601 --> 1:15:08.202
- God is good.
- Preach it, girl.

1:15:08.238 --> 1:15:10.905
And I want you to do my hair
like you did last time. Please?

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.708
- Yeah, you want me
to do your hair, pep?

1:15:13.743 --> 1:15:15.409
Tell me how you want me
to do your hair.

1:15:15.445 --> 1:15:17.645

like when we was freshman?

1:15:17.780 --> 1:15:20.214

1:16:59.182 --> 1:17:02.950
You know, that's salt and spin.
- Yeah, I feel you.

1:17:02.986 --> 1:17:04.752
- You're from jersey, right?

1:17:04.854 --> 1:17:08.122
- Yeah, born and raised.
You ever been to east orange?

1:17:08.157 --> 1:17:10.257
- Yeah, I been to east orange.
- Oh, yeah?

1:17:10.360 --> 1:17:11.892
- No.
- You're from queens, right?

1:17:11.995 --> 1:17:14.228
- Yeah. Originally,
I'm from jamaica, though.

1:17:14.364 --> 1:17:16.097
But I grew up in queens.

1:17:16.199 --> 1:17:18.065
I still got a condo there.
- Yeah?

1:17:18.201 --> 1:17:20.001
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

1:17:20.036 --> 1:17:23.437
I'm tryin' to get money
and keep it right in the 'hood.

1:17:23.539 --> 1:17:25.373
Yo, y'all's show was dope too.

1:17:25.408 --> 1:17:27.174
You got some nice bars.
- Word?

1:17:27.210 --> 1:17:30.011
- Yeah! "call me a crook,
a robber, a thief,

1:17:30.046 --> 1:17:32.313
but I'll be your butcher
if you've got beef."

1:17:32.348 --> 1:17:35.449
- that's--
- yo! Yeah, you go hard, yo.

1:17:35.551 --> 1:17:37.785
- Thank you. I appreciate that
comin' from you.

1:17:37.887 --> 1:17:39.787
- Yeah? Hmm.

1:17:39.889 --> 1:17:43.157
What's... Whoa!

1:17:43.192 --> 1:17:45.026
- You scared of heights?

1:17:45.061 --> 1:17:46.794
- Hell yeah!

1:17:46.829 --> 1:17:49.597
- You tough. Come on. Come on!
- Hell no!

1:17:51.334 --> 1:17:53.834
Oh, you crazy as hell!
- Can you

1:17:53.870 --> 1:17:56.337
handle all this crazy?

1:17:56.372 --> 1:18:00.207
(soft music)

1:18:16.426 --> 1:18:18.125
-<i> give it up</i>
<i> for salt-n-pepa, everybody!</i>

1:18:18.227 --> 1:18:21.228
(cheering and whooping)

1:18:22.565 --> 1:18:24.832
<i> that was hot, girls.</i>
<i> That was hot.</i>

1:18:24.934 --> 1:18:28.135
That song you just performed,
"let's talk about sex." did you

1:18:28.271 --> 1:18:30.471
have any idea it'd be so big?
- I mean,

1:18:30.573 --> 1:18:33.307
we thought it could be
'cause we had caught

1:18:33.409 --> 1:18:35.209
so much flak for "push it,"
you know what I'm sayin'?

1:18:35.244 --> 1:18:37.478
- Exactly. So this was
our challenge

1:18:37.580 --> 1:18:39.580
to the radio stations.
Like, oh, you thought we took it

1:18:39.615 --> 1:18:41.916
there before? Let's see
how you handle this.

1:18:41.951 --> 1:18:44.418
- Yeah. Like, everybody think
about sex, and they so...

1:18:44.454 --> 1:18:46.320
Hush-hush. That's what I think

1:18:46.422 --> 1:18:48.322
actually contributes
to the aids problem in america.

1:18:48.458 --> 1:18:50.558
- Yeah.
- That's the perfect transition.

1:18:50.593 --> 1:18:52.660
Because of some of the backlash
you got with this song,

1:18:52.762 --> 1:18:54.762
you actually had people reach
out for you in order to change

1:18:54.797 --> 1:18:56.997
the words to help aids.
Can you speak to that?

1:18:57.133 --> 1:18:59.867
- Oh, yeah. Peter jennings,
he reached out to salt-n-pepa

1:18:59.969 --> 1:19:02.470
<i> for us to change</i>
<i> from "let's talk about sex"</i>

1:19:02.505 --> 1:19:06.640
<i> to "let's talk about aids"</i>
<i> 'cause his daughter is</i>
<i> a fan of ours,</i>

1:19:06.676 --> 1:19:10.444
and, um, we did that.
And we think more rappers need

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:13.881
to use they voice to really
address the aids epidemic.

1:19:13.983 --> 1:19:17.051
- Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, this thing
has gone international.

1:19:17.153 --> 1:19:19.954
You're the first rap group
to go number one in germany,

1:19:19.989 --> 1:19:22.056
australia, and it just
keeps climbing.

1:19:22.158 --> 1:19:23.791
Can we talk a little
about your image?

1:19:23.826 --> 1:19:25.693
'cause you ladies,
you know, are role models

1:19:25.828 --> 1:19:28.429
for a lot of women out there.
- Thank you for saying that.

1:19:28.464 --> 1:19:31.732
- It's the truth. Am I lyin'?
(cheering and applause)

1:19:31.834 --> 1:19:33.834
(whooping)

1:19:34.971 --> 1:19:36.904
- we recorded
songs on this album

1:19:37.006 --> 1:19:38.706
like "independent"
and "expression"

1:19:38.841 --> 1:19:40.708
so that young girls know
that they can be themselves

1:19:40.810 --> 1:19:43.410
and let their voices be heard.
And also too that they can do

1:19:43.513 --> 1:19:45.546
anything that a man does.
(cheering)

1:19:45.648 --> 1:19:47.748
you know, we like to say
that we bring fun,

1:19:47.850 --> 1:19:50.417
fashion and femininity
to hip hop.

1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:52.920
- Yeah. And sandy, you recently
became a mom, correct?

1:19:53.022 --> 1:19:55.990
- Yeah, I have a son, tyran.

1:19:56.025 --> 1:19:57.825
I had him last July.
(audience "awws")

1:19:57.860 --> 1:19:59.660
- and cheryl,
you're expecting as well?

1:19:59.695 --> 1:20:02.029
- I am. I figure
pepa had a baby,

1:20:02.064 --> 1:20:04.498
so I figured it was time
for me to catch up.

1:20:04.534 --> 1:20:07.101
- Yeah, that's right, I forgot.
You and your producer hurby

1:20:07.203 --> 1:20:10.104
have been together for a while.
I mean, with all this goin' on,

1:20:10.206 --> 1:20:12.139
you three are still
out on the road,

1:20:12.175 --> 1:20:14.775
tourin', doin' videos,
recordin' more songs.

1:20:14.811 --> 1:20:16.610
I mean, do rappers not get
maternity leave?

1:20:16.712 --> 1:20:20.114
- I mean, what can we say?
A woman's work is never done.

1:20:20.149 --> 1:20:22.583
(cheering and applause)

1:20:22.685 --> 1:20:24.518
(whooping)
-<i> I don't understand</i>

1:20:24.554 --> 1:20:27.321
what you so upset about. What
did I say that was so wrong?

1:20:27.356 --> 1:20:29.456
- It's not what you said! It's
what you didn't say, cheryl!

1:20:29.492 --> 1:20:32.126
Everybody's gonna think hurby's
the father and you didn't
even acknowledge me!

1:20:32.228 --> 1:20:34.428
- Arsenio caught me off guard
and it wasn't a good time
to mention--

1:20:34.564 --> 1:20:36.864
- it wasn't a good time
to mention what?

1:20:36.899 --> 1:20:39.767
That the father of the baby in
your stomach is a nobody? Hmm?

1:20:39.869 --> 1:20:42.169
(tense music)

1:20:42.205 --> 1:20:44.605
- gavin...
- What?

1:20:44.740 --> 1:20:48.275
- You knew I wasn't over hurby
but you pursued me anyways.

1:20:50.046 --> 1:20:50.978
Why?

1:20:51.080 --> 1:20:53.247
- I guess we'll never know.

1:20:55.585 --> 1:20:57.818
(receding footsteps)
(door opens)

1:20:57.920 --> 1:20:59.386
(melancholy music)

1:20:59.422 --> 1:21:01.388
(door shuts)

1:21:06.262 --> 1:21:08.095
(exhales sharply)

1:21:09.732 --> 1:21:12.466
(siren blaring)

1:21:12.568 --> 1:21:15.469
- come on, now.
Come on. Give me a big push.

1:21:15.571 --> 1:21:19.473
- Yeah, cheryl. You
gotta push it good!
- Don't say that!

1:21:19.609 --> 1:21:21.375
(screaming)

1:21:21.410 --> 1:21:24.645
hi!
- Nah. Nah, I don't like it.

1:21:24.747 --> 1:21:26.347
- You don't like
none of our ideas.

1:21:26.449 --> 1:21:29.650
- Because it's not salt-n-pepa.
Why fix what ain't broken?

1:21:29.752 --> 1:21:32.386
- 'cause we need to
stay current. We need to come up

1:21:32.421 --> 1:21:34.021
with a track that's
gonna knock in the jeeps,

1:21:34.123 --> 1:21:36.223
somethin' gritty.
- Yeah. I wanna make a hit.

1:21:36.259 --> 1:21:38.559
- What, like that
"none of your business" song?

1:21:38.594 --> 1:21:41.328
- Exactly. That's a hit.
- It's some b.S. Is what it is.

1:21:41.464 --> 1:21:43.063
Talkin' 'bout
"if she wanna be

1:21:43.099 --> 1:21:45.499
a freak and sell it
on the weekend?"

1:21:45.635 --> 1:21:48.636
hurby, we are mothers. What kind
of example is that setting?

1:21:48.671 --> 1:21:50.804
- Look, this is my group.

1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:54.041
We gonna stick to the formula.
- Oh, it's your group?

1:21:54.143 --> 1:21:57.044
'cause the last time I checked,
it was salt-n-pepa.
- Exactly.

1:21:57.146 --> 1:21:59.880
It wasn't salt, pepa 'n hurby.
Don't you forget that part.

1:21:59.982 --> 1:22:01.949
- Oh! So y'all think y'all can
do this better than me?

1:22:01.984 --> 1:22:04.385
- I have a suggestion.
Album's supposed to be

1:22:04.487 --> 1:22:06.687
12 tracks, right? So why don't

1:22:06.822 --> 1:22:09.456
they do one half,
you do the other half

1:22:09.492 --> 1:22:11.425
and only the best songs
make the cut?

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:14.561
- Hmm. I like that.
- I could live with it.

1:22:14.664 --> 1:22:17.031
- Yeah, me too. Thank you, al.

1:22:17.133 --> 1:22:20.367
Finally, a man that gets us.
(hurby scoffs)

1:22:20.469 --> 1:22:23.237
- come on, tyran. Let's go.
(tyran laughing)

1:22:23.272 --> 1:22:25.406
- so y'all not gonna
clean up this mess?

1:22:25.508 --> 1:22:28.042
- (cheryl and sandra): It's none
of your business.

1:22:28.144 --> 1:22:29.877
(al chuckles)

1:22:30.012 --> 1:22:32.479
- there's nothin' wrong with
a little friendly competition,

1:22:32.515 --> 1:22:35.416
right?
- Nah. Not at all.

1:22:35.518 --> 1:22:37.484
(indistinct chatter)

1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:39.386
(hip hop music playing)

1:22:39.522 --> 1:22:42.756
- (man): Yeah, you lookin'
fine though.

1:22:42.858 --> 1:22:44.591
- (sandy): Y'all havin' fun?
Good.

1:22:44.694 --> 1:22:46.393
Hey, girl!
- (woman): Hey, girl!

1:22:46.495 --> 1:22:48.395
- (sandy): Oh, this your man?
He's cute!

1:22:48.497 --> 1:22:50.264
- (man): Nice to meet you.

1:22:50.366 --> 1:22:51.799
(people laughing)

1:22:51.834 --> 1:22:54.935
- yeah.

1:22:54.971 --> 1:22:56.770
(sandy laughs)

1:22:56.872 --> 1:22:59.406
hey! I ain't see you in forever!

1:22:59.542 --> 1:23:01.108
Oh, my god!

1:23:01.210 --> 1:23:04.278
Who you talkin' to? Hello?

1:23:04.313 --> 1:23:06.780
Why you not here?
(sandy laughs)

1:23:06.882 --> 1:23:10.918
(indistinct chatter)

1:23:11.020 --> 1:23:14.021
- (woman): You trippin'!
I did not look at your man!

1:23:14.056 --> 1:23:17.691
- (man): Come on, man! Let's go.
- (woman): Ok, you trippin' now.

1:23:17.727 --> 1:23:19.526
I did not look at your man.

1:23:19.562 --> 1:23:21.495
You crazy, girl!

1:23:21.530 --> 1:23:23.630
(choir singing)

1:23:23.733 --> 1:23:26.233
- good evening, mrs. Williams.
Good to see you.

1:23:26.268 --> 1:23:28.669
- Hello?
- Hey, girl. I got a song.

1:23:28.704 --> 1:23:31.705
We gotta get in the studio.
- Girl, this is not

1:23:31.741 --> 1:23:33.774
a good time. I'm gettin' ready
to walk into church.

1:23:33.909 --> 1:23:36.043
- Man, forget church
just for a second!

1:23:36.078 --> 1:23:39.446
[I got a bomb ass idea.]

1:23:39.582 --> 1:23:41.815
- sandy, I don't give
a damn about...

1:23:41.917 --> 1:23:44.151
- Good evening, miss james.
- Hi.

1:23:44.253 --> 1:23:46.220
Sandy, you are
workin' my nerves.

1:23:46.255 --> 1:23:48.989
[tell me your idea and quick.]
- ok. Bust it.

1:23:49.091 --> 1:23:50.991
So listen, I was just writin',

1:23:51.093 --> 1:23:52.793
it was just flowin' out
of my pen.

1:23:52.895 --> 1:23:56.697
You know what I'm gonna call it?
"shoop." what you think?

1:23:56.732 --> 1:23:59.033
- What is "shoop?"
- [what it means!]

1:23:59.068 --> 1:24:01.068
like, let's say you see
a cute guy and you tryin'

1:24:01.103 --> 1:24:03.070
to talk to him.
You don't have to wait for him

1:24:03.105 --> 1:24:06.173
to try and talk to you.
You can just talk to him!

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:09.676
We don't have to wait for men.
We can do what we want to do.

1:24:09.779 --> 1:24:11.578
Shoop!
- [yeah, that's...]

1:24:11.614 --> 1:24:15.049
that's dope. I'll work
on my verse when I get home.

1:24:15.084 --> 1:24:17.651
Now goodbye, sandy.
- [bye.]

1:24:20.623 --> 1:24:23.424
woo! Baby, you scared me.
What's up?

1:24:23.459 --> 1:24:25.259
- Uh-huh. Bet I did.

1:24:25.294 --> 1:24:27.061
Who you sneak off and talk to?

1:24:27.096 --> 1:24:28.962
- I didn't sneak off
to talk to anybody.

1:24:28.998 --> 1:24:31.899
It was loud out here. I came
in here to talk to cheryl.

1:24:31.934 --> 1:24:34.234
I was inspired by...

1:24:34.270 --> 1:24:36.336
- You was inspired?
- Yeah, I was inspired

1:24:36.472 --> 1:24:38.138
to do a new song.
- Inspired?

1:24:38.174 --> 1:24:40.140
- Yeah.
- Who the hell are you?

1:24:40.176 --> 1:24:43.343
Beethoven or something?
- Why you actin' like that?

1:24:45.147 --> 1:24:48.615
(sandy shrieks)
(high-pitched tone ringing)

1:24:48.651 --> 1:24:50.551
- the hell y'all lookin' at?!

1:24:50.653 --> 1:24:53.053
Huh?!
- (man): You know what it is.

1:24:53.089 --> 1:24:56.490

1:29:45.814 --> 1:29:47.948
(both laughing)

1:29:47.983 --> 1:29:49.716
- so the other day I was out,

1:29:49.818 --> 1:29:51.785
and I seen this baby
with her grandma.

1:29:51.820 --> 1:29:53.687
I asked if I could hold her.

1:29:53.789 --> 1:29:55.922

1:29:55.958 --> 1:29:57.591

1:29:57.626 --> 1:30:00.227
Then the mother comes back,
sees some black chick holdin'

1:30:00.329 --> 1:30:02.596
her little russian baby, and she
gave me this look like...

1:30:02.631 --> 1:30:04.631
- Of course she did.
(both laughing)

1:30:06.335 --> 1:30:08.969
- yo, I didn't even care.
It just felt

1:30:09.004 --> 1:30:11.405
so good to hold her
for a minute,

1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:13.707
pretended she was coco.

1:30:13.809 --> 1:30:16.910
- I know, but we're gonna be
done soon. I'm tired too.

1:30:17.012 --> 1:30:19.379
Can't wait to get back
to see both of my babies,

1:30:19.481 --> 1:30:22.716
ty and treach.
- Ahem.

1:30:22.851 --> 1:30:24.751
- What you clear
your throat like that for?

1:30:24.853 --> 1:30:27.254
- You already know how I feel.
Treach is fine and all,

1:30:27.289 --> 1:30:29.956
but he need to get
his anger issues under control.

1:30:29.992 --> 1:30:32.559
- He don't be like that
all the time.

1:30:32.694 --> 1:30:35.128
He just don't like when I be
gettin' smart with him.

1:30:35.164 --> 1:30:38.632
But he's very good.
He takes tyran when I'm tired

1:30:38.667 --> 1:30:41.435
to preschool.
And he wanna put him in soccer.

1:30:41.537 --> 1:30:42.669
Treach is a good man.

1:30:42.704 --> 1:30:44.905
And speakin' of that,

1:30:45.040 --> 1:30:47.741

- I'm not thinking
about gavin. Sit back.

1:30:47.876 --> 1:30:50.010
- Alright. Let me guess,

1:30:50.045 --> 1:30:52.245
you just gonna be a lesbian.
- Listen,

1:30:52.347 --> 1:30:55.449
between work and corin,
I'm not in the mental space

1:30:55.551 --> 1:30:57.684
to be considering<i> any</i> man.

1:30:57.719 --> 1:31:01.621
- But you're considering that
vibrator in your luggage.
I seen it.

1:31:01.723 --> 1:31:05.592
- Listen, trick, what's
in my suitcase is none
of your business.

1:31:05.727 --> 1:31:10.230
- I seen it!
- I will spray you.
- Oh, it's like that.

1:31:10.265 --> 1:31:12.466
- Stay on your side of the room.
- I just wanna see it!

1:31:12.568 --> 1:31:15.135
- For what?
- 'cause I'm looking to--

1:31:15.237 --> 1:31:19.039
let me see it!
- What you need to see

1:31:19.074 --> 1:31:21.541
- Aight.
- Thank you.

1:31:21.577 --> 1:31:24.578
- Thought we was friends.
(laughing)

1:31:26.915 --> 1:31:31.218
- no, for real, like,
you ever think, like,
what's the point of this?

1:31:31.253 --> 1:31:34.321
- What, being in russia?
I know, 'cause it's cold.

1:31:34.423 --> 1:31:37.691
- Nah, pep, like,
all of it. Like,

1:31:37.726 --> 1:31:40.560
we do a album, shoot videos
for it, on the road,

1:31:40.596 --> 1:31:43.230
do press, shoot more videos,
get like a month off,

1:31:43.265 --> 1:31:46.366
then it's time to record another
album, shoot more videos,

1:31:46.401 --> 1:31:48.869
and do it all over again.

1:31:48.904 --> 1:31:52.405
Like, I don't even know who I am
outside of the image
that we've created.

1:31:52.441 --> 1:31:56.176
- Don't you remember what
you told me when we got signed?

1:31:56.278 --> 1:31:59.212
This is the life
that we chose?

1:31:59.248 --> 1:32:02.115
And I like this life,
I don't know about you.

1:32:02.150 --> 1:32:07.254
- Yeah, but did we really?
I was 19, and you were 20.

1:32:07.289 --> 1:32:10.824
Like, did we know what we was
doing? Now our kids are
growing up without us

1:32:10.926 --> 1:32:14.494
and we're in russia
doing<i> yo! Mtv raps.</i>
- So?

1:32:14.630 --> 1:32:19.032
Why don't you stop complaining?
Don't this beat working
at sears?

1:32:19.134 --> 1:32:22.035
Yo, why don't you take some time
and just relax?

1:32:22.137 --> 1:32:25.505
Just enjoy our life.
Maybe if you stopped being

1:32:25.641 --> 1:32:28.074
so stressed out, you would stop
stressing me out.

1:32:28.110 --> 1:32:32.612
- Oh, I'm stressing you out?
- Yes, you are. It's getting
on my nerve.

1:32:36.485 --> 1:32:40.253
- Girl, you not hearing me.

1:32:40.289 --> 1:32:44.291
I don't know how much more
of this I can take.

to be 50 and 60

1:32:46.995 --> 1:32:50.597

She personally told me that she
don't want us doing that song.

1:34:10.479 --> 1:34:14.180
- Plus it's our new single.
We have to do it.

- Baby, I ain't trying
to be late

1:35:36.798 --> 1:35:39.899
to my own movie premiere. Throw
them damn jeans on and let's go!

1:35:39.935 --> 1:35:42.802
- You want me to look cute on
your arm tonight, don't you?

1:35:42.838 --> 1:35:47.240
Well, these jeans make
my booty look thick.

1:35:47.275 --> 1:35:49.943
- Who you trying
to look thick for?

1:35:49.978 --> 1:35:52.712
- Who else? You!

1:35:52.814 --> 1:35:57.117
- I axed you to rock the skirt,
you said nah, you just have
to rock these jeans.

1:35:57.152 --> 1:36:00.220
Now you say it's 'cause they
make your ass look thick.

1:36:00.322 --> 1:36:03.123
So, I want you
in a skirt,

1:36:03.158 --> 1:36:06.392
but you insist on rocking
these jeans; then obviously
it ain't for me.

1:36:06.495 --> 1:36:08.528
- Oh my god,
is this<i> new york undercover?</i>

1:36:08.630 --> 1:36:10.430
Are you a detective?
Like, what are you--

1:36:10.465 --> 1:36:14.534
- don't talk to me
like I'm stupid! The hell
I tell you 'bout that?

1:36:14.669 --> 1:36:16.770
- I'm sorry! I'm not--

1:36:16.805 --> 1:36:19.372
- if this was your movie
premiere, we'd have been there!
- Ok!

1:36:19.508 --> 1:36:22.308
- Let's go!
- Ok!
- No, hurry up!

1:36:24.146 --> 1:36:27.914
- You can't keep going back
to him, sandy!

1:36:27.949 --> 1:36:31.151
- I know.
- It's not good for you,

1:36:31.186 --> 1:36:35.421
or your son to see. So...
You won't come out now?

1:36:35.524 --> 1:36:39.659
- No.
- Alright, well,
then I'm coming in.

1:36:41.229 --> 1:36:46.399
Girl, listen. My dad was a
raging alcoholic, but that's
what I grew up with.

1:36:46.501 --> 1:36:50.403
And yours died too soon. Neither
one of us knows what a good man

1:36:50.539 --> 1:36:55.708
looks like, and now we stay
in relationships with men even
when they holding us back.

1:36:58.046 --> 1:37:00.513
I got something for this.
Hold on.

1:37:06.888 --> 1:37:08.888
You gon' come out now?

1:37:21.903 --> 1:37:25.371
- You know, I've been thinking
about my dad a lot lately.

1:37:25.407 --> 1:37:29.175
All I wanted to do
was make him proud.

1:37:29.211 --> 1:37:32.445
I don't think he'd be
so proud of me right now.

1:37:32.547 --> 1:37:36.583
- Yes, he would! Pep, you gotta
stop underestimating yourself.

1:37:36.618 --> 1:37:38.985
You are pepa
of salt-n-pepa

1:37:39.087 --> 1:37:41.654
and no one can ever
take that away from you.

1:37:41.690 --> 1:37:46.025
(pager beeps)

1:37:48.396 --> 1:37:50.730
- who was that?

1:37:50.765 --> 1:37:53.700
(laughing)
- gavin.

1:37:53.735 --> 1:37:58.304
- Gavin, gavin,
baby daddy gavin.

1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:01.207
(laughing)
ok.
- It's complicated.

1:38:01.243 --> 1:38:05.545
I'm taking him to church.
My pastor is really great.
You should come too.

1:38:05.580 --> 1:38:08.848
Don't give me that look.
- You having sex again?

1:38:08.950 --> 1:38:11.918
- Don't be concerned about me
and gavin having sex.

1:38:11.953 --> 1:38:14.320
- Yes!
- Anyway...
- Ok.

1:38:14.422 --> 1:38:18.191
- You know that label, red ant?
It's been dying to sign us.

1:38:18.226 --> 1:38:22.028
Word on the street is they got
a lot of money and they wanna
prove themselves.

1:38:22.130 --> 1:38:24.464
- Listen, I'm down. It's hurby

1:38:24.499 --> 1:38:27.333
that's gonna be the problem.
Best time for us to go.

1:38:27.469 --> 1:38:32.872
Just the two of us.
- This is business, and if hurby
want a little off the top

1:38:32.974 --> 1:38:35.675
from this deal,
fine, he deserves it.

1:38:35.810 --> 1:38:37.710
But if he wanna fight,

1:38:37.812 --> 1:38:40.980
<i> let him take us to court.</i>

1:38:42.817 --> 1:38:45.685
I ain't scared of hurby no more.

1:38:47.188 --> 1:38:51.457
- (court clerk): All rise.

1:38:51.493 --> 1:38:54.527
- In the matter of azor

1:38:54.663 --> 1:38:57.797
versus james and denton,

1:38:57.832 --> 1:39:03.436
ruling in favour of the defence,
denton and james. This case
is dismissed.

1:39:03.471 --> 1:39:06.606
(cries of joy)
- dismissed!

1:39:08.443 --> 1:39:13.246
- Y'all don't owe him anything?
- Nothing. And he has to pay
our court fees, so that means

1:39:13.348 --> 1:39:16.316
that now you can work
on your solo album.

1:39:16.351 --> 1:39:19.352
- Good job, baby.
- Good seeing you.

1:39:21.356 --> 1:39:23.489
- I'll see you.
- Bye, gavin. See y'all later.

1:39:25.193 --> 1:39:29.429
- Congrats, cher. You finally
got what you wanted, free.

1:39:29.531 --> 1:39:32.298
- It didn't need to be
this way, hurby.

1:39:32.334 --> 1:39:35.468
We tried to get you to settle.
We were gonna give you
everything.

1:39:35.503 --> 1:39:38.404
You let them
persuade you to sue us.

1:39:38.506 --> 1:39:42.108
- Hey... It is what it is.

1:39:42.210 --> 1:39:45.244
I know you hate me.

1:39:45.380 --> 1:39:48.047
But believe it or not,
I'm proud of you.

1:39:48.083 --> 1:39:50.416
Proud of the woman you are,

1:39:50.518 --> 1:39:54.087
proud of what we did.
Remember that?

1:39:55.890 --> 1:39:59.292
Came a long way from
that shy girl at sears,
I'll tell you that.

1:39:59.394 --> 1:40:01.627
- I could never hate you.

1:40:01.730 --> 1:40:04.130
We've been through too much
together for that.

1:40:04.165 --> 1:40:06.199
The issues that
you and I had,

1:40:06.234 --> 1:40:10.703
that's in the past. I'm focused
on the future now.

1:40:14.376 --> 1:40:17.477
- Then I'm gonna head out.

1:40:17.579 --> 1:40:21.280
- Ok. Take care of yourself.

1:40:28.690 --> 1:40:31.491
- Maybe she forgot.

1:40:31.526 --> 1:40:35.595
- So, what do you wanna do?
You wanna call it a day?

1:40:35.697 --> 1:40:37.964
You can still make your meeting.

1:40:37.999 --> 1:40:40.733
- We don't have time to be
running studio sessions
right now.

1:40:40.835 --> 1:40:44.937
We have to deliver an album
by July. She knows that.

1:40:45.040 --> 1:40:46.839
And can you please

1:40:46.875 --> 1:40:51.344
get the junk food
out of my face?

1:40:51.379 --> 1:40:55.782
(sighing)

1:40:55.884 --> 1:40:58.518
- want me to try
and page her again?

1:40:58.553 --> 1:41:01.154
- No. I'll call her.

1:41:05.727 --> 1:41:08.795
Yo, I'm looking for sandy.
Who is this?

1:41:08.897 --> 1:41:13.533
- Who this?
- This is cheryl.
- [oh. Babe!]

1:41:13.568 --> 1:41:15.868
(loud music)
cheryl wanna talk to you.

1:41:15.904 --> 1:41:18.304
- [I'm not home!]
- [you is home.]

1:41:18.339 --> 1:41:21.641
(laughing)
yo, she ain't... She ain't...

1:41:21.743 --> 1:41:24.444
[she was here but she not here,
aight? She not here right now.]

1:41:24.579 --> 1:41:28.314
can I page you back?
- [no.]

1:41:28.349 --> 1:41:31.217
don't bother.

1:41:31.252 --> 1:41:35.321
(loud music and laughter)

1:41:35.423 --> 1:41:38.624
(rap song)

1:41:48.436 --> 1:41:54.073
(muffled rap song)

1:41:55.777 --> 1:41:59.479
(loud music)

1:42:06.754 --> 1:42:09.889
sandy!

1:42:13.495 --> 1:42:16.129
Sandy!

1:42:18.466 --> 1:42:22.268
(loud music)

1:42:30.178 --> 1:42:32.278
sandy!

1:42:32.313 --> 1:42:36.215
- Oh! Hey, girl!
(laughing)

1:42:36.317 --> 1:42:38.985
I'm sorry.
Here come the sheriff.

1:42:39.020 --> 1:42:41.354
- So it's like that? You just
blow me off and then say

1:42:41.456 --> 1:42:44.624
you not here when I call here?
- You know I would invite you,

1:42:44.659 --> 1:42:49.195
but you know you. You don't like
to hang out, so no invite.
- We are supposed

1:42:49.297 --> 1:42:53.466
to be working. I've been
in the studio with al all day.
Let me guess, you forgot?

1:42:53.501 --> 1:42:56.569
- No, I did not forget.
I just was tired today

1:42:56.671 --> 1:43:00.072
and I didn't wanna throw it on
my verse, but tomorrow, boom!
I'm gonna do my verse.

1:43:00.108 --> 1:43:04.377
In fact, you probably should hit
this little blunt so you can
really cool out and be cool.

1:43:04.479 --> 1:43:08.881
That's why I don't mess with
you, 'cause you know...
- You got it.

1:43:08.983 --> 1:43:11.584
- We got time, cheryl.
We ain't gotta trip like this.

1:43:11.686 --> 1:43:14.787
- You got time, but I don't.
Not for all this.

1:43:14.822 --> 1:43:17.757
You don't even know
these people.
- They my friends.

1:43:17.859 --> 1:43:20.426
- Friends.
- They my new friends.
- New friends, ok.

1:43:20.461 --> 1:43:24.330
- That's why you wasn't invited.
- Ok. They ain't gonna be
around long.

1:43:24.365 --> 1:43:26.832
- Ooh! Say how
you really feel, then.

1:43:26.868 --> 1:43:30.436
- And what's that?
- Ok. All the shit you be
talking behind my back,

1:43:30.538 --> 1:43:34.974
how I don't appreciate you, I
don't do nothing in the group,
I'm jealous of you...

1:43:35.009 --> 1:43:38.744
- I never once said that
you was jealous of me.
- You better not say that,

1:43:38.846 --> 1:43:39.979
'cause I ain't.

1:43:40.014 --> 1:43:43.115
I can hold my own any day.
- Did I ever say you didn't?

1:43:43.218 --> 1:43:46.719
- Pff, sometimes.
- Pep, I bend over backwards
to make you happy,

1:43:46.754 --> 1:43:49.622
do everything that I need to do
to make sure that pep is cool,

1:43:49.724 --> 1:43:53.859
pep is happy, pep is satisfied,
but it's never enough for you.
What the hell else

1:43:53.895 --> 1:43:56.295
do you want from me?
- Cher, I don't want
nothing from you.

1:43:56.397 --> 1:44:00.800
- Cher! What's up, girl? Hey,
baby girl, looking all...

1:44:00.902 --> 1:44:04.837
Look at you. Look at you.
- Stop acting crazy!

1:44:04.872 --> 1:44:07.607
She go to church now.

1:44:07.709 --> 1:44:11.110
- She going to church now.
- What did I say?
- We did a normal kiss.

1:44:11.212 --> 1:44:13.613
We did a business kiss for you.
(laughing)

1:44:13.748 --> 1:44:17.316
no, cheryl, for real, I'ma see
you tomorrow at the studio.

1:44:17.418 --> 1:44:21.287
I'ma be on that beat.
(vocalising)

1:44:23.258 --> 1:44:25.358
(vomiting)
- mom?

1:44:25.393 --> 1:44:29.161
(knocking)
mom, you ok?
- I'm ok, sweetie, I'm ok.

1:44:29.264 --> 1:44:33.633
I'm ok.

1:44:33.735 --> 1:44:36.435
(dramatic music)

1:44:42.310 --> 1:44:45.211
- ladies, let's be honest.

1:44:45.246 --> 1:44:49.649
The only reason you're here is
'cause your little indie record
label went flip-flop.

1:44:49.751 --> 1:44:53.352
Record sales are down. The only
way to make money is to tour.

1:44:53.454 --> 1:44:56.989
- First of all, before
we agree to anything,

1:44:57.091 --> 1:44:59.859
what are our guarantees?
What are our percentages,

1:44:59.894 --> 1:45:02.528
our accommodations,
transpo...

1:45:02.630 --> 1:45:05.765
- I'm still smoothing all
that out, but it's gonna be
about forty cities.

1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:09.368
- Ok, and what about venues?
So we know how big a show
we could do.

1:45:09.404 --> 1:45:13.739
- It ain't gonna be no arenas.
Mostly clubs. You all wanna...

1:45:13.775 --> 1:45:17.543
Get some dancers, that's on you
two, but I'm just paying
for the two of you

1:45:17.645 --> 1:45:19.512
plus, what is it?
Spin... Spinderella?

1:45:19.614 --> 1:45:22.181
- Nah, that's ok. I'm good.
- Uh, excuse me?

1:45:22.283 --> 1:45:24.917
I don't get to vote? Let me
guess, you just decide

1:45:24.952 --> 1:45:27.053
for the whole group
as you always do.

1:45:27.088 --> 1:45:30.923
- Oh, come on! Five years ago,
we played woodstock.

1:45:30.958 --> 1:45:33.259
Now you wanna settle for these
little clubs with some dude

1:45:33.294 --> 1:45:36.028
who can't even give us
basic information?
- Oh, cheryl,

1:45:36.164 --> 1:45:37.697
some of us have bills.

1:45:37.799 --> 1:45:40.633
- Did I tell you to go out and
buy that big-ass mansion? No.

1:45:40.668 --> 1:45:42.201
- Did you tell me not to?

1:45:42.337 --> 1:45:44.970
'cause I remember I asked
your opinion and you said
"go ahead, sandy!

1:45:45.006 --> 1:45:47.473
We good now!"
did I tell you to produce

1:45:47.508 --> 1:45:49.909
a wack-ass album? No.

1:45:50.011 --> 1:45:52.545
- We were both responsible
for that album, if you remember.

1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:56.315
We had an obligation
and we got it done.

1:45:56.351 --> 1:45:58.617
Besides, that wack-ass album got
you that big-ass advance.

1:45:58.653 --> 1:46:01.087
Now two years later you wanna
talk about bills?

1:46:01.189 --> 1:46:04.290
- Here we go with the two years
and the past and all--

1:46:04.325 --> 1:46:07.226
- ok, ladies, ladies, ladies.

1:46:07.362 --> 1:46:09.729
Let's not do this here.

1:46:09.831 --> 1:46:12.565
- Excuse me? Whose side
are you on anyway?

1:46:12.700 --> 1:46:16.502
Why is it always up to cheryl
to hold everything together?

1:46:24.846 --> 1:46:28.247
Fine. I'll do it.
- That's what's up.

1:46:28.349 --> 1:46:32.651
- Oh, and I'm pregnant, so just
keep that in mind and spring
for a luxury bus.

1:46:32.687 --> 1:46:36.756
- Ooh, thank you so much
for saving me.

1:46:36.858 --> 1:46:39.792

(knocking at door)
- who is it?

1:48:38.679 --> 1:48:43.182
(knocking)
what? Who is it??
- Girl,

1:48:43.217 --> 1:48:46.785
I had a premonition of death.
Somebody's gonna die.

1:48:51.025 --> 1:48:54.560
- Baby's doing ok.
Everything's fine.

1:48:54.695 --> 1:48:59.064
But, cheryl, you have
to stop working.
- I know,

1:48:59.166 --> 1:49:02.668
but we're almost done
with the tour--
- forget the tour.

1:49:02.703 --> 1:49:08.040
I'm telling you as your doctor,
you have to stop. The amount
of pressure you're under

1:49:08.075 --> 1:49:12.311
can and will hurt the baby.
(dramatic music)

1:49:18.486 --> 1:49:20.619
- who puts hot sauce on eggs?
- Well, I do, for one.

1:49:20.721 --> 1:49:23.956
It's aight, you just ain't
ready for all that yet.

1:49:23.991 --> 1:49:26.292
Eat all that up
and you'll see

1:49:26.327 --> 1:49:28.193
at your basketball
game later.

1:49:28.229 --> 1:49:33.032
- I can dribble.
- Yeah, that's what they all say
until they on a basketball court

1:49:33.067 --> 1:49:35.801
with me. Look at your mom!

1:49:35.903 --> 1:49:39.004
Ha! Yeah!

1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:41.807
Yeah, she might know

1:49:41.842 --> 1:49:44.910
what she doing.
She's good, she's good!

1:49:44.946 --> 1:49:47.713
- They sound good.
Don't they sound sweet?

1:49:47.748 --> 1:49:51.984
Yes. I heard on the radio
the other day

1:49:52.086 --> 1:49:54.987
that a lot of us are
coming down with diabetes,

1:49:55.089 --> 1:50:00.059
high blood pressure, and why?
'cause we don't correct

1:50:00.094 --> 1:50:03.162
our relationship with food.
(audience approves)

1:50:03.264 --> 1:50:06.732
case in point, exhibit a:
I love... I love french fries.

1:50:06.767 --> 1:50:10.002
But you know what I found out?
French fries don't love me back.

1:50:10.104 --> 1:50:13.505
(audience laughs)
I do like a glass of red wine
now and then.

1:50:13.608 --> 1:50:17.710
But if you're an alcoholic,
you might go from one wine
to five to ten...

1:50:17.745 --> 1:50:21.647
You can't control it.
You can't find that balance
if you're an alcoholic.

1:50:21.749 --> 1:50:24.350
If you're an alcoholic, wine
ain't gonna love you back.

1:50:24.452 --> 1:50:29.989
And when you drink too much,
what happens? You throw up, you
purge, because your body knows

1:50:30.091 --> 1:50:33.926
it's not good for you.
You come to understand in life

1:50:33.961 --> 1:50:36.595
there are things we do enjoy,

1:50:36.631 --> 1:50:41.000
some things that we do love,
but they are not good for us.

1:50:41.102 --> 1:50:44.937
<i> But they don't love us back.</i>
<i> And you know what?</i>

1:50:44.972 --> 1:50:48.340
It is the same thing

1:50:48.476 --> 1:50:50.442
with people.

1:50:53.614 --> 1:50:56.415
- Baby, I'm tired.

1:51:00.988 --> 1:51:04.156
(soft music)

1:51:05.993 --> 1:51:08.460
baby, stop.

1:51:10.998 --> 1:51:13.732
- You supposed to be
my ride or die.

1:51:13.834 --> 1:51:16.035
You gon' make me beg for it?

1:51:16.170 --> 1:51:19.905
Is we married or not?
- Yes, we are married,
of course.

1:51:20.007 --> 1:51:24.376
But does that mean every time
you wanna do it, I do? No.

1:51:24.512 --> 1:51:27.312
- Hell's wrong with you?

1:51:27.348 --> 1:51:29.648
<i>- What do we love about people?</i>

1:51:29.684 --> 1:51:33.419
Two things. We love
who they are,

1:51:33.521 --> 1:51:37.456
<i> but we also have</i>
<i> to love who we are</i>

1:51:37.491 --> 1:51:41.593
with them. For example,
you may be a woman

1:51:41.629 --> 1:51:46.265
and you might love a guy.
He's a good dude in many ways,
but he's got some anger issues,

1:51:46.367 --> 1:51:50.102
you see what I'm saying? He
keeps putting his hands on you.
Well, you know what?

1:51:50.204 --> 1:51:52.838
He's not gonna stop
until he's good and ready.

1:51:52.873 --> 1:51:55.240
- You don't control me.
You don't tell me what to do.

1:51:55.342 --> 1:51:57.943
- Oh, you telling me
how it's gonna go?
- I am.

1:51:58.045 --> 1:52:01.080
- Nah, I'm telling you
how it's gonna go, bitch!
I wanna divorce!

1:52:01.182 --> 1:52:05.617
How that's gonna go?
- That's fine. Whatever.
That's how it's gonna go.

1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:09.154
(arguing)

1:52:09.190 --> 1:52:11.290
- you may have
a girlfriend,

1:52:11.392 --> 1:52:14.460
<i> a best friend. You like</i>
<i> hanging out with her,</i>
<i> but something happens</i>

1:52:14.562 --> 1:52:20.165
<i>when y'all together. You bring</i>
<i>out the negativity in her, and</i>
<i> vice-versa. The combination,</i>

1:52:20.201 --> 1:52:23.035
the balance, is wrong.

1:52:23.070 --> 1:52:25.537
Crazy's not just being crazy.

1:52:25.573 --> 1:52:29.274
<i>Crazy is doing the same thing</i>
<i> again and again and again</i>

1:52:29.376 --> 1:52:32.377
and expecting what?
A different result.

1:52:32.413 --> 1:52:34.947
<i> That doesn't mean that this</i>
<i> person's a good person</i>
<i> or a bad person.</i>

1:52:35.082 --> 1:52:40.119
There's no judgment in this.
Don't expect them to change.
You have the power

1:52:40.221 --> 1:52:44.990
to make that change. And you
know what? You have to control
your own well-being.

1:52:45.092 --> 1:52:47.226
Can I get a amen?

1:52:47.261 --> 1:52:50.095
(cheers and applause)

1:52:50.131 --> 1:52:53.699
(phone ringing)

1:52:53.734 --> 1:52:55.467
- [hey, sandy.]

1:52:55.569 --> 1:52:59.371
- girl, you'll be so proud
of me. I finally got--
- [no.]

1:52:59.406 --> 1:53:02.474
[this time, I'm going first.]

1:53:02.610 --> 1:53:05.010
- ok. Alright.
- [I just...]

1:53:05.045 --> 1:53:10.015
wanna let you know that I don't
wanna be joined at your hip
anymore.

1:53:10.050 --> 1:53:13.652
- What you mean? I don't
understand what you saying.

1:53:13.754 --> 1:53:17.589
(cheryl sobs.)
- [I can't do this anymore.]

1:53:17.625 --> 1:53:21.260
I don't want to do this anymore.

1:53:21.295 --> 1:53:23.595
I just need you to understand,

1:53:23.631 --> 1:53:27.733
I feel like I can't breathe.
- You can't breathe?

1:53:27.768 --> 1:53:30.269
What's the problem?
What's going on?

1:53:30.304 --> 1:53:34.006
- [it's... It's everything.
It's you, it's me,]

1:53:34.108 --> 1:53:37.876
it's me not wanting to be salt
for the rest of my life.

1:53:37.978 --> 1:53:40.879
I wanna turn my life
over to christ,

1:53:40.981 --> 1:53:45.417
and I've tried to make this
work, you know that I have.

1:53:47.655 --> 1:53:50.289
I don't even know who I am.

1:53:50.324 --> 1:53:54.560
I'm in pain all the time.

1:53:54.662 --> 1:53:58.964
I've given everything
I have to salt-n-pepa.
- [you've given everything]

1:53:58.999 --> 1:54:02.601
to this group. Like I haven't?

1:54:02.636 --> 1:54:05.070
[we both got kids.]

1:54:05.172 --> 1:54:09.041
I haven't given anything
to this group?

1:54:09.176 --> 1:54:11.577
It's been the two of us,

1:54:11.679 --> 1:54:15.447
so anything you went through,
I was right there.
- [I know!]

1:54:15.482 --> 1:54:17.816
but that's the point.

1:54:17.852 --> 1:54:21.253
I need to carve out a space
that has nothing to do with you.

1:54:21.288 --> 1:54:24.957
[to figure out what I want
from my life.]

1:54:24.992 --> 1:54:27.626
- word.

1:54:27.661 --> 1:54:32.130
Treach leave, you leave,
my father leave-- that's fine.

1:54:32.166 --> 1:54:35.901
[you're quitting
just like them.]

1:54:37.671 --> 1:54:40.405
I don't need you.

1:54:40.541 --> 1:54:42.908
(sniffling)

1:54:43.043 --> 1:54:46.511
I don't even need you.

1:54:51.852 --> 1:54:54.753
You know that premonition I had?

1:54:54.855 --> 1:54:57.556
It was of us.

1:54:57.591 --> 1:55:00.192
We died.

1:55:00.227 --> 1:55:03.996
Yo, this friendship is dead.

1:55:07.902 --> 1:55:11.436
(sorrowful music)

1:55:24.818 --> 1:55:27.052
- (man):<i> Herere's wendy willia.</i>

1:55:27.154 --> 1:55:29.621
- (wendy):<i> I've got some</i>
<i> sad news to pass along to you.</i>

1:55:29.657 --> 1:55:33.025
<i> A couple of hip-hop icons</i>
<i> decided to hang up their stuff</i>

1:55:33.127 --> 1:55:36.662
<i> and go their separate ways</i>
<i> for once and for all.</i>

1:55:36.697 --> 1:55:39.231
<i> I'm talking about two of my</i>
<i> personal favorites,</i>

1:55:39.333 --> 1:55:44.303
<i> sandy and sheryl,</i>
<i> a.K.A. Salt-n-pepa.</i>

1:55:44.338 --> 1:55:48.140
<i> Normally with a group</i>
<i> that started out in the 80s,</i>

1:55:48.175 --> 1:55:51.810
<i>when they finally decide to call</i>
<i> it quits after 15 years,</i>

1:55:51.845 --> 1:55:54.947
<i> some people say</i>
<i> "it's about that time".</i>

1:55:54.982 --> 1:55:56.982
<i> But this one hurts.</i>

1:55:57.017 --> 1:56:02.154
<i> If either one of you all</i>
<i> want to spill tea, call wendy.</i>

1:56:04.992 --> 1:56:07.092
(muffled music)

1:56:07.194 --> 1:56:10.362
- well?

1:56:13.867 --> 1:56:16.234
- Nah. It's not ready yet.

1:56:16.370 --> 1:56:19.104
- Cheryl, you said that
about every mix.

1:56:19.206 --> 1:56:23.575
I mean, we spent a ton of money
on this. We got all the guest
collabs you wanted,

1:56:23.677 --> 1:56:28.013
the hottest producers you asked
for... You telling me you still
don't like it?

1:56:28.048 --> 1:56:30.983
- It just doesn't sound right
without sandy to me.

1:56:31.018 --> 1:56:33.118
There, I said it.

1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:35.687
Sandy pulled me out of my box,

1:56:35.723 --> 1:56:39.324
but I kept her
from going over the edge.

1:56:41.729 --> 1:56:44.129
- I can't tell you
how much of a fan I am.

1:56:44.231 --> 1:56:46.698
- Oh, thank you.
- I grew up on salt-n-pepa.

1:56:46.734 --> 1:56:48.800
So please don't take this
as disrespect, but...

1:56:48.902 --> 1:56:52.004
I didn't realise that,
when I called you, you guys
weren't together anymore.

1:56:52.039 --> 1:56:55.440
Look, without salt, I just...
(phone ringing)

1:56:55.542 --> 1:56:58.510
I just don't think
it's gonna work.
- But we can--

1:56:58.545 --> 1:57:01.680
- yeah, go ahead? Uh-huh.

1:57:01.715 --> 1:57:05.717
(soft music)

1:57:07.755 --> 1:57:10.355
(sobbing)

1:57:10.391 --> 1:57:13.025
<i>- I need to carve out a space</i>

1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:16.094
that has nothing to do with you.

1:57:17.765 --> 1:57:21.633
- Nah, I'm telling you
how it's gonna go, bitch!
I wanna divorce!

1:57:27.207 --> 1:57:29.841
(dramatic music)

1:57:29.943 --> 1:57:33.979
- mom? Mom! The phone's for you!

1:57:34.114 --> 1:57:37.416
- Ok, I'll be right out!

1:57:40.921 --> 1:57:45.257
- Right, right.

1:57:45.292 --> 1:57:48.093
Nah, I hear you. Mm-hmm.

1:57:48.128 --> 1:57:51.063
Yeah, definitely,
I'll let her know.

1:57:51.098 --> 1:57:53.799
Ok. Yeah.

1:57:53.834 --> 1:57:56.535
Alright, you'll hear
from us. Bye.

1:57:56.637 --> 1:57:59.504
- Who was that?
- Uh...

1:57:59.606 --> 1:58:02.574
Vh1.

1:58:02.609 --> 1:58:05.110
Producers. They wanna
honour you guys

1:58:05.145 --> 1:58:07.446
on some, like, hip-hop
hall of fame kinda thing.

1:58:07.481 --> 1:58:10.582
It's in September.

1:58:13.153 --> 1:58:17.189
I kinda figured you wouldn't
wanna do it, that's why I didn't
give you the phone.

1:58:17.324 --> 1:58:21.093
- I have to do it. Vh1 wants
to honour salt-n-pepa,

1:58:21.128 --> 1:58:24.963
and salt says no?
I can't do that.

1:58:26.834 --> 1:58:29.801
They don't want us
to perform, do they?

1:58:46.019 --> 1:58:49.454
- How you feeling, sandy?
You nervous?

1:58:49.490 --> 1:58:52.190
Excited? Pissed off?

1:58:52.226 --> 1:58:53.692
- Yes.

1:58:53.727 --> 1:58:57.295
(fans cheering)

1:59:04.004 --> 1:59:07.405
(audience cheering)
- give it up

1:59:07.508 --> 1:59:11.209
for queen latifah!
(cheers and applause)

1:59:11.245 --> 1:59:14.913
- in the early days of hip-hop,
it was basically a boys' club.

1:59:15.015 --> 1:59:17.482
All the biggest rappers
and djs were men.

1:59:17.518 --> 1:59:21.286
And while a few pioneering
sisters did manage to make
some noise--

1:59:21.388 --> 1:59:24.289
shout-out to roxanne shante,
sha-rock,

1:59:24.391 --> 1:59:26.391
and the ladies of sequence--

1:59:26.426 --> 1:59:29.294
it wasn't until our next
honorees burst onto the scene

1:59:29.396 --> 1:59:34.366
that female rappers were finally
able to shatter hip-hop's
glass ceiling.

1:59:34.401 --> 1:59:36.401
The duo of cheryl "salt" james

1:59:36.436 --> 1:59:41.072
and sandy "pepa" denton started
ricking the mic in 1985
and never looked back.

1:59:41.108 --> 1:59:43.909
Later joined by their dj,
dee dee "spinderella" roper,

1:59:43.944 --> 1:59:46.645
