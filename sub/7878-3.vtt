00:34.546 --> 00:38.249
Wow, a private tennis lesson
with Maria Sharapova.

00:53.163 --> 00:55.297
I scared him
right out the window.

00:55.365 --> 00:58.400
You're the scariest man
I know.

00:58.468 --> 01:00.169
I think I dislocated
my shoulder.

01:00.237 --> 01:01.453
Ah, it's so crooked and awesome.

01:01.521 --> 01:02.888
Don't set it.

01:02.956 --> 01:04.657
We'll freak people out
with it tonight at the...

01:04.724 --> 01:07.960
BOTH
Scariest haunted house
on the block, witches!

01:08.028 --> 01:10.879
And every year you get me
so scared, I pee my pants.

01:10.947 --> 01:11.947
Eight years running.

01:12.015 --> 01:13.148
What up?

01:14.317 --> 01:15.684
Hey.

01:15.752 --> 01:17.253
What do you think
of my poker face?

01:17.320 --> 01:18.988
Call the paparazzi.

01:19.055 --> 01:20.990
Is that Terry?

01:21.057 --> 01:22.224
Terry Gaga.

01:22.292 --> 01:24.093
Looking forward
to your haunted house tonight.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.945
It'll scare you straight.

01:26.012 --> 01:27.546
Every year.

01:28.832 --> 01:30.432
What the heck was that?

01:30.500 --> 01:33.319
Sounds like it came
from Buckle and Shari's house.

01:35.622 --> 01:37.690
Buckle's doing
a haunted house?

01:37.757 --> 01:38.724
That's my thing.

01:38.792 --> 01:40.693
Oh, he's new
to the neighborhood.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.027
He clearly doesn't know
that you're

01:42.078 --> 01:44.129
the Fresh Prince
of Bel Scare.

01:44.197 --> 01:46.548
Let's go see what
this amateur is doing.

01:46.633 --> 01:48.417
Wait, what about
my shoulder?

02:00.764 --> 02:02.398
I'll ... kill you!

02:03.466 --> 02:04.767
Not too shabby, huh?

02:07.737 --> 02:09.822
Everything you see here
is my own creation.

02:09.889 --> 02:11.824
This is all stuff
I wanted to do

02:11.891 --> 02:13.709
when I was an Imagineer
at Disney

02:13.777 --> 02:17.029
but was told my ideas
weren't "family friendly."

02:17.080 --> 02:21.150
I'll skin you alive,
you little whore!

02:21.217 --> 02:22.901
I'm getting my nails done.

02:22.969 --> 02:24.553
I guess I'm taking
the pumpkin car

02:24.621 --> 02:26.455
since my Mazda's blocked in.

02:28.908 --> 02:31.410
And get this facocta
ghoul off the car!

02:31.461 --> 02:33.579
That's your navigation
system, hon.

02:33.646 --> 02:35.714
At the corner, take a fright.

02:35.782 --> 02:38.050
Shut up!

02:38.118 --> 02:40.486
Well, I sure hope
you guys can make it tonight

02:40.553 --> 02:42.137
for all the fun.

02:42.205 --> 02:45.974
But, but I'm, I'm the Fresh
Prince eight years running.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.660
Oh, my God, Buckle!

02:53.733 --> 02:56.935
How do you like
my inflate-double?

02:57.003 --> 02:59.538
Shari says we're
both full of hot air.

03:00.807 --> 03:02.775
I never envisioned
my life like this.

03:02.842 --> 03:05.411
I don't know how to get out.

03:09.549 --> 03:12.718
Steven, let me guess:
you're a Transformer.

03:12.786 --> 03:14.186
A Transformer?

03:14.254 --> 03:16.388
I'm not a child anymore, madam.

03:16.456 --> 03:17.956
I am a Gobot.

03:18.024 --> 03:20.459
And Barry?
I'm Jonah Hill,

03:20.527 --> 03:23.629
or Seth Rogen
if I put on Steve's glasses.

03:25.115 --> 03:27.416
And Snot,
are you a gymnast?

03:27.484 --> 03:30.419
No, these are my
gym clothes, okay?

03:30.487 --> 03:33.789
My mom sold my dragon costume
to buy dental dams.

03:33.857 --> 03:36.091
What do I care if she spreads
what she's got?

03:36.159 --> 03:37.426
She's already got it.

03:37.494 --> 03:39.628
I don't care
if those other guys get it.

03:42.482 --> 03:44.016
Come in, kids.

03:44.084 --> 03:46.351
I bought Toshi
a fun samurai outfit,

03:46.419 --> 03:48.320
but he's too stubborn
to put it on.

03:50.457 --> 03:53.392
But Toshi,
this is your heritage.

03:56.312 --> 03:57.296
Slam!

03:57.363 --> 03:59.748
You promised
your sister.

03:59.816 --> 04:02.885
Unless you boys would be
willing to take Akiko?

04:10.226 --> 04:12.261
Hummina, hummina,
hummina, boner.

04:12.328 --> 04:13.262
What?

04:13.329 --> 04:14.696
No, I mean, I mean, yeah,

04:14.764 --> 04:16.265
you can come,
more the merrier, whatevs.

04:16.332 --> 04:17.499
I love you, not even.

04:20.103 --> 04:22.488
He wants you to protect me
and have me back by sundown.

04:22.555 --> 04:23.722
No, he's looking out for you.

04:23.790 --> 04:24.723
I like that.

04:24.791 --> 04:26.525
Strong family bond.

04:26.593 --> 04:28.093
You know what this says
a lot for?

04:28.161 --> 04:29.461
Two-parent homes.

04:29.529 --> 04:30.579
Let's stay together, people,

04:30.647 --> 04:32.481
let's work it out.

04:34.918 --> 04:36.952
Stan, if you want those
guts to look real,

04:37.020 --> 04:39.254
I suggest using
a Bolognese.

04:39.339 --> 04:41.540
You know, after university,
I traveled through Italy,

04:41.591 --> 04:43.559
stabbing students.

04:43.626 --> 04:45.327
Francine,
where have you been?

04:45.395 --> 04:46.662
You're supposed
to be peeling grapes

04:46.729 --> 04:48.063
for our bowl
of eyeballs.

04:48.131 --> 04:49.998
I had to go see
Buckle's again.

04:50.066 --> 04:51.300
What?!

04:51.367 --> 04:53.469
You went to another man's
haunted house?

04:53.536 --> 04:54.870
I couldn't help it.

04:54.938 --> 04:57.523
I honestly don't know
how I got out of there.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.742
The upstairs hallway spiraled
into a black hole

05:00.810 --> 05:05.247
and the weather kept changing
and then I was a child again.

05:05.315 --> 05:06.748
Well, mine is going
to be way better

05:06.816 --> 05:08.283
once I hang all these cobwebs.

05:08.351 --> 05:09.651
How scary are these?

05:09.719 --> 05:11.954
Spiders made these,
people are meant to think.

05:12.021 --> 05:15.574
Stan, I'm sorry, but you
can't compete with Buckle.

05:15.642 --> 05:16.708
What are you
talking about?

05:16.759 --> 05:18.327
I'm still the
scariest...

05:18.394 --> 05:19.578
What is that sound?

05:19.629 --> 05:20.662
Nothing.

05:21.698 --> 05:23.198
That's pee-pee.

05:23.266 --> 05:25.968
Did you-- did you pee
yourself at Buckle's?

05:26.035 --> 05:29.805
I'm sorry, Stan, but it's
really scary over there.

05:29.873 --> 05:32.241
He has this terrifying
Semitic woman

05:32.308 --> 05:34.209
that keeps screaming "Coasters!"

05:34.277 --> 05:35.511
I couldn't help it.

05:35.578 --> 05:38.480
My panties overflowed
and filled my shoes.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.315
I can't believe
this is happening.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.050
Stan, you're going
to have to face it.

05:42.118 --> 05:44.953
Buckle's haunted house
is better than yours.

05:45.021 --> 05:48.457
The Stan Smith
haunted house era is over.

05:48.525 --> 05:50.259
Wait, but I
already told Bat Boy

05:50.326 --> 05:53.295
he could live in our basement
till spring.

05:53.363 --> 05:55.948
Is there a problem, Stan?

05:56.015 --> 05:59.851
'Cause I already gave up my bed
at the hospital.

06:04.057 --> 06:06.508
Roger?
Down here.

06:06.576 --> 06:08.594
Sit on me, like
a suitcase.

06:10.346 --> 06:12.514
There's a lot of
history in these jeans.

06:12.582 --> 06:14.082
Pam Anderson was
wearing these

06:14.150 --> 06:17.619
when she found out she had all
four hepatitises-- hepatiti?

06:17.687 --> 06:19.121
Either way,
she's a friend.

06:19.188 --> 06:21.857
Ah, forget it.

06:21.941 --> 06:23.108
Don't worry,
I'll get these on

06:23.159 --> 06:24.209
before the haunted
house starts.

06:24.277 --> 06:25.394
Sorry, Roger, it's off.

06:25.461 --> 06:26.361
What?

06:26.429 --> 06:28.330
Francine's thrown in the towel.

06:28.398 --> 06:30.299
She says I can't compete
with Buckle.

06:30.366 --> 06:31.300
And you know what?

06:31.367 --> 06:32.267
She's right.

06:32.335 --> 06:33.702
No, she's not.

06:33.770 --> 06:35.837
You can make your house
scarier than Buckle's.

06:35.905 --> 06:36.838
How?

06:41.327 --> 06:43.662
A lot of folks out there
are trying to scare people

06:43.730 --> 06:45.731
with fake ghouls and goblins.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.215
That's all fantasy.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.800
That's not the world we live in.

06:48.851 --> 06:51.470
It's time to get
back to basics, Stan.

06:51.521 --> 06:52.771
You work at the CIA.

06:52.838 --> 06:53.939
You can get real stuff

06:54.007 --> 06:55.607
that's even scarier.

06:55.675 --> 06:59.010
Real corpses, real eyeballs,
real skeletons.

06:59.062 --> 07:01.413
Stan, it's time for you...

07:25.638 --> 07:27.139
Francine will see
our haunted house

07:27.206 --> 07:28.490
can still be
the scariest.

07:28.558 --> 07:30.459
I'm gonna get real.
You do that.

07:30.526 --> 07:32.678
I'm gonna find out who
these black people are.

07:35.398 --> 07:38.567
<i>Come on, say something</i>
<i>to impress her,</i>

07:38.651 --> 07:41.403
<i>something funny,</i>
<i>something Halloween-related.</i>

07:41.487 --> 07:43.855
So that Cadbury egg I ate
made me gassy.

07:48.077 --> 07:50.228
All right,
the sun's going down.

07:50.296 --> 07:52.164
Let's get Akiko home
so we can head over

07:52.231 --> 07:54.466
to Vince Chung's bonfire
in the woods.

07:54.534 --> 07:57.903
Parents love
P.F. Chang's.

07:57.970 --> 07:58.954
You guys go ahead.

07:59.022 --> 08:00.856
I'll walk Akiko home.

08:05.278 --> 08:07.145
Oh, my God,
the ghost of Whiskers.

08:07.213 --> 08:08.864
I'm sorry, Whiskers!

08:08.931 --> 08:11.900
I didn't know you couldn't
breathe underwater!

08:13.085 --> 08:14.503
Where are you going?

08:14.570 --> 08:15.937
My house is this way.

08:16.005 --> 08:18.106
I know, but
we're having fun.

08:18.174 --> 08:20.342
Plus, I thought we'd head
over to Vince Chung's bonfire.

08:20.410 --> 08:21.510
That sounds great,

08:21.577 --> 08:24.212
but Toshi said I had
to be back by sunset.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.997
He's super protective,
Steve.

08:26.065 --> 08:27.666
Don't worry
about Toshi.

08:27.734 --> 08:29.935
What's he going to do,
come after us?

08:42.381 --> 08:45.384
Yah, yah, yah!

08:51.023 --> 08:54.042
Well, I finally
got into my jeans.

08:54.110 --> 08:56.311
I'm muffin-topping
pretty bad.

08:58.264 --> 08:59.147
Who are they?

08:59.232 --> 09:00.182
Serial killers.

09:00.266 --> 09:01.433
What?!

09:01.484 --> 09:03.635
Yeah, I'm keeping it real,
just like you said.

09:03.686 --> 09:06.021
What's scarier
than real live murderers?

09:06.105 --> 09:08.473
My God, Stan,
you're a genius.

09:08.524 --> 09:10.976
This will be your scariest
haunted house ever.

09:11.043 --> 09:13.278
Francine will forget
all about Buckle.

09:13.346 --> 09:15.113
Usually when I
see men in cages,

09:15.164 --> 09:19.551
they're kissing each other and
I'm throwing pesos at them.

09:19.619 --> 09:21.002
Peso!
Kiss!

09:22.071 --> 09:23.855
Kiss!

09:23.923 --> 09:25.757
Peso!

09:31.519 --> 09:33.626
I used my CIA
connections to borrow

09:33.651 --> 09:35.818
five of the most
ruthless serial killers

09:35.886 --> 09:37.353
on the eastern
seaboard.

09:37.421 --> 09:39.556
When Francine sees I
saved our haunted house,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.340
she's going to be
totally back on board.

09:41.392 --> 09:43.509
And then maybe tonight
I'll introduce her to...

09:43.577 --> 09:45.612
♪ The thickness! ♪

09:47.014 --> 09:49.816
I died of fright
at Buckle's House of Horror.

09:51.118 --> 09:54.370
Free ghost churros
for the little ones.

09:54.455 --> 09:56.089
Did you see those ghosts?

09:56.156 --> 09:57.590
Oh, my God.

09:57.658 --> 09:59.659
I'm gonna swing by Targét
on the way to Buckle's

09:59.727 --> 10:02.061
and pick up some Huggies.

10:02.129 --> 10:04.847
My house is going to be
way better than Buckle's.

10:04.915 --> 10:06.349
I ain't 'fraid
of no ghosts.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.968
How dare you quote
<i>Ghostbusters</i> to me.

10:09.036 --> 10:11.137
I wrote a movie called
<i>Rump Busters</i> and threw it

10:11.205 --> 10:13.473
at a guy on the bus
who looked like Harold Ramis.

10:13.540 --> 10:15.408
Two weeks later,
<i>Ghostbusters</i> came out.

10:15.476 --> 10:16.409
Coincidence?

10:16.477 --> 10:18.745
Absolutely.

10:18.812 --> 10:21.214
Happy Halloween.

10:22.650 --> 10:23.750
Trick or treat!

10:23.817 --> 10:25.451
Oh, my God, Steve and Akiko.

10:25.519 --> 10:27.687
How-- how do you know
our names?

10:27.755 --> 10:29.022
Toshi's looking for you two.

10:30.524 --> 10:32.558
Oh, no, Toshi's furious.

10:32.626 --> 10:33.660
There he is.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.865
Come on, let's cut
through the house.

10:42.036 --> 10:46.172
I... enjoy dolphins.

10:50.344 --> 10:51.427
Where are we going?

10:51.495 --> 10:52.578
Listen.

10:52.646 --> 10:54.047
It's the Langley Falls.

10:54.114 --> 10:55.181
We can hide from
Toshi there.

10:56.817 --> 10:59.218
Next time I'm going to get
a crush on Snot's sister.

10:59.286 --> 11:02.639
She can only move so fast
in those polio braces.

11:06.276 --> 11:08.244
I don't know about this costume.

11:08.312 --> 11:10.480
I want to go as someone sexy.

11:10.547 --> 11:12.281
Come on, everyone
does the sexy thing.

11:12.366 --> 11:13.533
It's so played out.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.767
What the hell are you?

11:14.818 --> 11:16.185
I'm the cowardly lion.

11:16.253 --> 11:18.488
No, you're a sexy
cowardly lion!

11:18.555 --> 11:20.223
Guilty as charged.

11:20.290 --> 11:21.624
Now follow me.

11:21.692 --> 11:23.726
I have a surprise for you.

11:27.998 --> 11:31.634
I don't think you'll be going
to Buckle's when you see...

11:31.702 --> 11:33.436
actual serial killers.

11:35.339 --> 11:36.739
Serial killers?

11:36.807 --> 11:37.840
That's
right.

11:37.908 --> 11:39.409
Uh, what do they do?

11:39.476 --> 11:40.743
It's not
what they do.

11:40.811 --> 11:42.211
It's what
they did.

11:42.279 --> 11:44.514
Between them, they've
killed 86 people,

11:44.581 --> 11:46.916
and most of the hookers
Drew Carey's slept with.

11:46.984 --> 11:48.217
Oh, Stan!

11:57.344 --> 11:59.929
Wow! This place
is magical.

11:59.997 --> 12:02.532
Yeah, every time I come here,
I see something new.

12:02.599 --> 12:03.883
Like a rare insect,

12:03.951 --> 12:06.419
or an older man
and a younger man hooking up.

12:06.487 --> 12:07.687
Hey, let's go swimming!

12:07.755 --> 12:10.123
There's a cave
on the other side of the falls.

12:10.190 --> 12:12.175
They say if you swim
to it with someone,

12:12.242 --> 12:14.944
you're friends forever!

12:15.012 --> 12:16.713
Not the best swimmer.

12:16.780 --> 12:19.282
Guess we're just leaving
our candy unattended.

12:38.202 --> 12:41.204
Akiko, that was
incredible!

12:41.271 --> 12:42.772
<i>Incredible...</i>
<i>Incredible.</i>

12:44.041 --> 12:45.274
That was a duck.

12:45.342 --> 12:46.843
<i>That was a duck.</i>

12:46.910 --> 12:48.277
<i>That was a duck.</i>

12:49.480 --> 12:51.114
Step right up and behold.

12:51.181 --> 12:52.949
Death Row!

12:53.016 --> 12:55.384
More like Lame Row.

12:55.452 --> 12:57.453
Those guys aren't scary at all.
What?!

12:57.521 --> 12:58.888
Hey, let's go to Buckle's.

12:58.956 --> 13:01.941
I hear he's got this tiny bat
that flies up your urethra.

13:02.009 --> 13:03.793
It's crazy.
It feels crazy.

13:06.379 --> 13:08.898
Guys, it's show time!
What gives?

13:08.966 --> 13:10.266
Come on, where's the rage?

13:10.334 --> 13:12.602
Are you tired?
Is it too cold in here?

13:12.669 --> 13:13.870
Is it the lights?

13:13.937 --> 13:15.204
Are they making
that buzzing noise?

13:15.272 --> 13:16.739
Hey, Manny!

13:16.824 --> 13:18.841
The lights are making
the buzzing noise again.

13:21.545 --> 13:23.379
Oh... boy.

13:27.050 --> 13:29.986
Stan, nice try,
but this is so boring.

13:30.053 --> 13:32.221
I'm gonna go to Buckle's.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.406
Please, give
it a chance.

13:33.474 --> 13:34.690
Hello.

13:34.758 --> 13:36.292
Roger, the plan's
not working.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.593
They're just
sitting here.

13:37.661 --> 13:39.295
Well, that's why
I'm dressed like Francine.

13:39.363 --> 13:40.897
You got
to get 'em riled up.

13:40.964 --> 13:42.198
Poke the bear a little.

13:42.266 --> 13:44.100
Appeal to their rapey side.

13:44.168 --> 13:47.336
Anyone want to cut my head off
and have sex with my body?

13:47.404 --> 13:49.305
You look like
a fat pear.

13:49.373 --> 13:51.274
I hate you, you
fat, gray pear!

13:52.576 --> 13:54.677
You monster!
What turns you on?!

13:54.745 --> 13:56.762
Flesh-colored,
non-fruit shaped people?!

13:56.830 --> 13:58.130
Like this one?

13:58.198 --> 14:00.082
Is this what you want?!

14:00.150 --> 14:02.335
Now that's a head
I could cut off!

14:02.402 --> 14:03.519
Let me out of here!

14:06.439 --> 14:08.207
Honey, how come
you're not peeing?

14:08.275 --> 14:09.625
I don't know.

14:09.710 --> 14:12.111
It's like looking at a shark
in an aquarium.

14:12.179 --> 14:15.081
They're menacing,
but it's not really that scary.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.502
Great. Now I need
a new Halloween costume.

14:19.586 --> 14:21.220
Roger, I'm taking one
of your outfits.

14:21.288 --> 14:22.621
Francine, wait!

14:22.673 --> 14:24.690
Do not use
my Barbara Walters outfit!

14:24.758 --> 14:26.342
I'm interviewing Mo'Nique
next week.

14:26.426 --> 14:28.427
I'm gonna ask her
to sit on my lap!

14:30.264 --> 14:32.565
Maybe I'll go as a slutty
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

14:32.633 --> 14:34.166
Francine, don't
go to Buckle's!

14:34.234 --> 14:36.168
We can take turns
kicking Bat Boy.

14:36.236 --> 14:37.653
Stan, you don't
have to worry.

14:37.721 --> 14:39.472
I fixed
everything.

14:41.341 --> 14:42.475
What's going on?

14:42.543 --> 14:43.609
I let the
prisoners out.

14:43.677 --> 14:44.777
You what?!

14:44.845 --> 14:46.612
Yeah, Francine was right.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.481
A shark's not very intimidating
behind glass,

14:48.549 --> 14:50.649
but if you're in the ocean
with it...

14:50.701 --> 14:52.602
But Roger, they're
going to kill us all!

14:52.669 --> 14:54.237
And chop off my head!

14:54.304 --> 14:56.455
Scary, right?

14:56.523 --> 14:59.091
Ugh!
I never think things through.

15:02.879 --> 15:04.670
I'm coming for
you, Francine!

15:04.770 --> 15:06.750
Stan, call
the police!

15:06.850 --> 15:08.283
Good thinking.

15:09.452 --> 15:11.303
They cut the line.

15:12.689 --> 15:14.273
Help!

15:14.340 --> 15:16.008
Serial killers
are loose in here!

15:16.076 --> 15:17.342
Call the police!

15:17.410 --> 15:19.812
Let's check
it out.

15:19.879 --> 15:21.313
No, no.
What are you doing?!

15:21.381 --> 15:22.614
Don't come over here!

15:22.682 --> 15:24.550
It's very dangerous!
You will die!

15:24.617 --> 15:27.386
All right!
KID 2:
Hurry up!

15:27.454 --> 15:30.255
KID 3:
Seriously, guys, that homemade
Tootsie Roll made me feel funny.

15:30.323 --> 15:32.324
I think I'm
gonna pass out.

15:32.392 --> 15:34.059
Morons!

15:34.127 --> 15:36.028
Well, we're sitting
ducks up here.

15:36.096 --> 15:38.047
We've got to sneak
out of the house.

15:38.131 --> 15:39.865
before the killers
get to us.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.586
Oh... boy.

15:50.810 --> 15:51.944
Excuse my hair.

15:52.011 --> 15:53.545
It's super frizzy,

15:53.613 --> 15:56.381
and the only thing about this
moment I wish I could change.

16:00.070 --> 16:01.320
Aah!

16:09.679 --> 16:11.447
GoBot activate!

16:12.782 --> 16:15.334
Form of...
escape rocket!

16:54.774 --> 16:56.408
Get out of here!
You're gonna die!

16:59.946 --> 17:02.114
Why are you running?

17:02.182 --> 17:04.148
I love you!

17:20.733 --> 17:21.817
Lean against
the door!

17:21.901 --> 17:23.702
VITAS
The door won't budge.

17:23.770 --> 17:25.654
They must have the
fridge against it.

17:25.722 --> 17:27.556
Uh, this is my wake-up call.

17:36.199 --> 17:37.533
Do it!
Kill me!

17:37.600 --> 17:40.569
Because that's what you're
doing to your sister.

17:40.637 --> 17:43.972
Look, you've got to stop
being so overprotective.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.607
She's not a
little girl, Toshi.

17:45.675 --> 17:47.042
She's a young lady.

17:47.110 --> 17:48.577
I know you love her,

17:48.645 --> 17:50.812
but if you don't loosen
your kung-fu grip,

17:50.880 --> 17:53.198
you're gonna lose her...
forever.

18:04.077 --> 18:06.228
Thanks for sticking up
for me, Steve.

18:06.296 --> 18:09.414
Now I can finally date without
worrying about Toshi's wrath,

18:09.482 --> 18:14.119
which is so great, because
I have such a big crush on Doug.

18:14.187 --> 18:15.003
Doug?!

18:17.807 --> 18:19.341
But Doug's nine.

18:19.409 --> 18:21.376
He's a really nice guy.

18:21.444 --> 18:24.196
And Doug can dance.

18:24.264 --> 18:26.031
♪ ♪

18:54.978 --> 18:57.095
♪ ♪

19:13.046 --> 19:14.413
We can't hold them off
forever!

19:14.480 --> 19:16.348
I can't believe we're
gonna get butchered

19:16.416 --> 19:19.117
all because you needed to
have the best haunted house!

19:19.185 --> 19:20.919
I did all this
for you, Francine.

19:20.987 --> 19:22.621
What? Why?

19:22.689 --> 19:23.889
To impress you.

19:23.957 --> 19:25.457
You chose Buckle over me.

19:25.525 --> 19:27.342
It doesn't matter
whose house is scarier.

19:27.410 --> 19:28.910
You're my wife.

19:28.978 --> 19:30.846
You're supposed
to stand by my side,

19:30.913 --> 19:33.682
lie to me and tell me
my house is better.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.718
Oh, my God, Stan,
I'm so sorry.

19:36.786 --> 19:38.537
This is all
my fault.

19:38.604 --> 19:40.005
Yeah, it is your fault.

19:45.411 --> 19:46.511
Head for
the woods!

19:46.579 --> 19:47.663
It's always
safe there!

20:11.671 --> 20:12.487
Hai!

20:17.977 --> 20:18.910
Hai!

20:18.978 --> 20:20.145
Ya!

20:25.451 --> 20:27.219
Ah... ya!

20:45.488 --> 20:47.322
Abba-Zaba!

20:50.893 --> 20:53.395
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.

20:53.463 --> 20:55.464
Come on. There's something
I've wanted to do

20:55.531 --> 20:57.566
since I first laid eyes on you.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.635
Get those bangs off your face.

21:00.703 --> 21:02.504
I'm taking this home with me.
