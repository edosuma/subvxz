WEBVTT

00:01.152 --> 00:02.919
This is why I buy my food
from gas stations, Jess.

00:02.953 --> 00:04.921
Nick, you knocked
over a wheelbarrow

00:04.955 --> 00:07.824
full of fruit, and then
you actually skipped away.

00:07.859 --> 00:09.192
Guys, I'm trying
to concentrate, okay?

00:09.227 --> 00:11.127
The LAPD does not
offer entrance exams

00:11.162 --> 00:12.429
every single day.

00:12.463 --> 00:13.663
Just Mondays and Fridays.

00:13.698 --> 00:16.099
But I am not
waiting till Friday.

00:16.133 --> 00:18.001
Hey, why do you
have so much fruit?

00:18.035 --> 00:19.936
Because this one ran
into his ex-girlfriend

00:19.971 --> 00:21.204
at the farmer's market.

00:21.239 --> 00:22.339
Nick?

00:22.373 --> 00:25.008
Hey! No way!

00:25.042 --> 00:27.177
Caroline of my past.

00:27.211 --> 00:29.346
What a pleasant surprise.

00:29.380 --> 00:30.847
My ex-lover... No!

00:32.283 --> 00:33.483
I don't deal with exes.

00:33.517 --> 00:34.751
They're part of the past.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.419
You burn 'em swiftly

00:36.454 --> 00:38.788
and you give their ashes
to Poseidon.

00:38.823 --> 00:40.423
I'm really good friends
with Berkley,

00:40.458 --> 00:42.392
and we had a terrible breakup...
Come on, what?

00:42.426 --> 00:43.593
You have a good
relationship with him

00:43.628 --> 00:44.794
because he wants to bone you.

00:44.829 --> 00:46.229
He's a stay-at-home dad.

00:46.264 --> 00:49.332
His entire life
revolves around his family.

00:49.367 --> 00:51.268
He's the most emotionally
evolved person I know.

00:51.302 --> 00:53.503
And I'm sure his favorite
emotion is the emotion

00:53.537 --> 00:55.405
of wanting to bone you.

00:55.439 --> 00:56.439
That's not an emotion.

00:56.474 --> 00:58.308
Possible sex is the only reason

00:58.342 --> 01:00.110
people stay "friends" with their exes.

01:00.144 --> 01:02.145
- Come on.
- Back me up, Winnie the Bish.

01:02.179 --> 01:04.147
Yeah, that's true. I mean,
I'm friends with all my exes...

01:04.181 --> 01:05.415
- See?
- ...families.

01:05.449 --> 01:06.383
Ha-ha! See?

01:06.536 --> 01:08.248
I still send Shelby's dad
a Father's Day card,

01:08.428 --> 01:10.787
and he still sends me
five bucks on my birthday.

01:10.821 --> 01:12.822
- What is wrong with you?
- That's nice. - Hey, guys.

01:12.857 --> 01:14.724
- I bet Coach is friends with his exes.
- No.

01:14.759 --> 01:16.526
- Oh, for sure, yeah.
- Yeah! I'm right!

01:16.560 --> 01:17.890
- For sex.
- No!

01:18.057 --> 01:18.957
Ha-ha! I'm right!

01:19.057 --> 01:20.797
Can't spell "sex" without the "ex."

01:20.831 --> 01:22.465
Man, is that sexy when he does that.

01:24.335 --> 01:26.937
Announcement:
I finally finished my loft.

01:26.971 --> 01:28.104
Hold the applause.

01:30.341 --> 01:31.708
Let's go. All right.

01:31.742 --> 01:34.311
Come on.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.578
C-Come on, you guys.

01:35.613 --> 01:37.147
All together, now.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.315
We're not...
Who's coming?

01:38.349 --> 01:39.883
Let's go.
Come on, Nick.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.284
I don't want to go, man.
Thanks for the invite.

01:41.319 --> 01:42.285
Nah, come on.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.287
Winnie.

01:44.322 --> 01:45.588
No?

01:50.750 --> 01:55.269
Synced and corrected by backinblack
www.addic7ed.com

01:55.400 --> 01:57.634
You and Caroline
still need some closure.

01:57.668 --> 01:59.135
Well, what do you
want me to say?

01:59.170 --> 02:01.638
That I walked out on her
and now I'm dating you?

02:01.672 --> 02:04.074
We started dating, like,
a year after you broke up.

02:04.108 --> 02:05.275
Yeah, but that doesn't matter with her.

02:05.309 --> 02:06.443
She's got a crazy streak,

02:06.477 --> 02:08.110
and this is bound to set her off.

02:08.145 --> 02:09.545
What if she hurts me physically?

02:09.580 --> 02:11.581
What if she hurts me with words?

02:11.615 --> 02:13.316
Just talk to her. Clear the air.

02:13.351 --> 02:15.185
You'll feel better, she'll feel better.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.519
Besides, Nick,

02:16.554 --> 02:18.588
I can't give up that farmer's market.

02:18.622 --> 02:20.457
Strolling around,
chatting with vendors...

02:20.491 --> 02:22.859
It's so nice.
I feel like Don Corleone.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.661
I think a lot of ladies do.

02:31.369 --> 02:32.335
Hey.

02:33.371 --> 02:34.471
Hey...

02:36.874 --> 02:38.641
Sorry about that.

02:38.676 --> 02:40.210
Haven't spoken anybody all day.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.411
Phlegm buildup, you know?

02:42.713 --> 02:45.482
I've been cooped up all day
in my loft apartment.

02:45.516 --> 02:47.150
So much space for one person, you know?

02:47.184 --> 02:49.719
You could scream in there,
nobody would ever hear you.

02:49.754 --> 02:51.287
I'm gonna go.

02:51.322 --> 02:52.555
Bye.

02:54.759 --> 02:55.892
What is going on?

02:55.926 --> 02:58.061
May I speak plainly with you, Cecilia?

02:59.263 --> 03:00.897
I'm in a bit of a sexual drought.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.533
The Good Valley Schmidt
hasn't seen rain in months.

03:03.567 --> 03:06.202
You're just... you're
giving off a creepy vibe.

03:06.237 --> 03:08.238
All right? Living alone
is messing up your game

03:08.272 --> 03:09.506
and it's making you weird.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.307
Yeah, but I love living alone.

03:11.342 --> 03:13.076
Where are you, grapes?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.878
Grápés.

03:14.912 --> 03:16.346
Great apes.

03:16.380 --> 03:18.548
Grapes, we have you surrounded.

03:18.582 --> 03:19.983
Come out with your stems up!

03:26.757 --> 03:28.191
I guess my game could be upped

03:28.225 --> 03:30.060
if I increased my... my human contact

03:30.094 --> 03:31.561
- a little bit.
- Good.

03:31.595 --> 03:33.363
Because you're caressing
your own arm right now.

03:34.899 --> 03:36.232
Hmm.

03:36.267 --> 03:37.500
That's not normal, man.

03:37.535 --> 03:39.302
I've been working out.
It feels... I don't...

03:41.072 --> 03:43.706
I just want to know
why you walked out.

03:43.741 --> 03:45.942
Was there something else going on?

03:45.976 --> 03:47.277
Was there someone else?

03:47.311 --> 03:49.045
Can I just say,

03:49.080 --> 03:51.214
I really wish this coffee
was a giant beer.

03:51.248 --> 03:52.348
And I wish this scone

03:52.383 --> 03:54.117
was a-a whiskey and I could just

03:54.151 --> 03:55.418
drink one... just chase 'em.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.688
This is nice.

03:58.722 --> 04:00.256
Glad we're doing this.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.058
So how'd it go?

04:02.093 --> 04:03.426
We gabbed like a couple

04:03.461 --> 04:05.228
of washer women over the back fence.

04:05.262 --> 04:08.565
That's great.
So proud of you.

04:09.733 --> 04:11.134
You two are dating?

04:11.168 --> 04:13.236
I knew it. I knew it was her!

04:13.270 --> 04:14.704
What...?

04:14.738 --> 04:16.439
You didn't tell her we were together?!

04:16.474 --> 04:18.241
I told her we were together.

04:18.274 --> 04:20.610
I'm not getting away with this.
I didn't tell her.

04:20.644 --> 04:21.744
Screw you, Miller!

04:24.050 --> 04:26.784
I don't understand.
You guys talked for 30 minutes.

04:26.819 --> 04:29.020
- How did our relationship not come up?
- 'Cause I got scared.

04:29.054 --> 04:30.855
There were so many things
that I wanted to tell her.

04:30.889 --> 04:32.257
You ever thought how weird it would be

04:32.291 --> 04:33.625
if you just gave up your thumb?

04:33.659 --> 04:35.260
You just didn't have a thumb.

04:35.294 --> 04:37.528
I mean, how would you give a
thumbs up? Just like this?

04:37.563 --> 04:39.264
I think a guy died in the
building, 'cause one day

04:39.298 --> 04:41.466
in the Dumpster is a bunch
of clothes that just fit me.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.501
What I like to do now

04:43.535 --> 04:44.736
is take the Underground, yeah?

04:44.770 --> 04:46.871
Spend my quid. Cheers?

04:48.741 --> 04:50.208
Oh, crap. This is her.

04:50.242 --> 04:51.876
She thinks I cheated, Jess.

04:51.910 --> 04:54.479
You know who
you should talk to? Berkley.

04:54.513 --> 04:57.382
He's so good at this stuff...
friendship, closure.

04:57.416 --> 04:59.817
Actually, he did write a book
about it. It's an e-book.

04:59.852 --> 05:02.720
I gave it four stars, but it
kind of falls apart at the end.

05:02.755 --> 05:05.089
He goes into God in a way
I don't think he needs to.

05:05.124 --> 05:06.591
You know what?
I'm gonna text him?

05:06.625 --> 05:08.526
Why would I talk to your ex-boyfriend

05:08.560 --> 05:09.527
about my ex-girlfriend?

05:09.561 --> 05:11.229
Well, you need his help.

05:11.263 --> 05:13.064
- You're right. Give me. Can I see?
- No, no, no.

05:13.098 --> 05:14.299
- Can I see?
- Yeah. Yeah.

05:14.333 --> 05:15.733
"Hey, babe..."
Don't call him "babe."

05:15.768 --> 05:16.801
It's just what we call each other.

05:16.835 --> 05:18.069
"BF problems"?

05:18.103 --> 05:19.837
My boyfriend is having problems.

05:19.872 --> 05:21.939
- XOXO?
- It's a really common greeting.

05:21.974 --> 05:23.474
"Kissing you, hugging you,
kissing you, hugging you"?

05:23.509 --> 05:25.910
What else am I gonna write?
"O-O-O"?

05:25.944 --> 05:27.912
That just looks like "Oh..."

05:27.946 --> 05:29.347
You're leading him on, Jess.

05:29.381 --> 05:31.182
- Oh, Nick.
- You are.

05:31.216 --> 05:32.617
Berkley's really gonna teach you a lot.

05:32.651 --> 05:34.585
Men don't talk to people they've dated

05:34.620 --> 05:37.021
unless they want sex,
or they're Winston.

05:37.056 --> 05:39.090
- I also want sex.
- Going to Schmidt's.

05:39.124 --> 05:40.591
He's been begging us to all week.

05:40.626 --> 05:42.460
Jess, men are sick.

05:42.494 --> 05:45.163
Look, I'm a relatively good guy,
but even I'm a sicko.

05:45.197 --> 05:47.131
Luckily, we have the Internet
as a community of...

05:48.534 --> 05:50.168
Oh, this is terrible!

05:50.202 --> 05:51.803
She's quoting scriptures,

05:51.837 --> 05:53.604
but using tons of cuss words.

05:53.639 --> 05:55.440
- This is as bad as it gets with Caroline.
- Okay.

05:55.474 --> 05:58.209
Berkley's around the corner
at his baby's world music class.

05:59.478 --> 06:02.213
Okay, you know what? I'm in.

06:02.247 --> 06:03.948
- Great.
- What kind of beer does Berkley like?

06:03.982 --> 06:05.383
- He doesn't.
- Oh, great.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.051
I cannot wait to meet him.

06:08.087 --> 06:09.487
Fellas.

06:09.521 --> 06:12.557
You made it. As promised,
here's a coupon for a free sub.

06:12.591 --> 06:14.025
Yup.

06:14.059 --> 06:15.493
Probably get ham.

06:15.527 --> 06:17.995
Wow, man.

06:18.030 --> 06:19.530
- It's nice inside of here, man.
- Yeah.

06:19.565 --> 06:21.065
It's like a European airport.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.066
Oh, what's that?

06:22.101 --> 06:23.334
Uh, you want to watch the game?

06:23.369 --> 06:25.403
Which one? Basketball? Football?

06:25.437 --> 06:26.471
Of Thrones?

06:26.505 --> 06:28.406
Oh!

06:28.440 --> 06:29.874
That is awesome, man.

06:29.908 --> 06:31.309
Look at this place, Schmidt.

06:31.343 --> 06:32.877
You got so many plush surfaces.

06:32.911 --> 06:34.812
Well, there are 15 different
bang spots in here,

06:34.847 --> 06:37.115
each one specifically designated
to its own sexual position.

06:37.149 --> 06:38.516
Mm.

06:38.550 --> 06:40.952
That's standing, this is sitting,
that's diagonal.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.120
That's how I do it.

06:42.154 --> 06:43.354
The "Why? Why? Because."

06:43.389 --> 06:45.022
The "Closure of the Lincoln Tunnel."

06:45.057 --> 06:47.158
The "Red Beanbag Chair."

06:47.192 --> 06:49.193
Which is pretty obvious, but,
you know, that's a good one.

06:49.228 --> 06:50.561
The "Glass Menagerie."

06:50.596 --> 06:51.863
- The "Bike Share."
- Nice.

06:51.897 --> 06:52.897
The "Backwards Oops."

06:52.931 --> 06:53.998
What is "backwards oops"?

06:54.032 --> 06:55.900
You don't want to put it... mm.

06:55.934 --> 06:56.834
You don't know what it means.

06:56.869 --> 06:57.835
I mean, I don't...

06:57.870 --> 06:59.203
I've done it, I've done it,

06:59.238 --> 07:01.572
but I didn't know I was
doing it. You know, it was...

07:01.607 --> 07:02.573
Super cool, dude.

07:02.608 --> 07:04.509
I wish I had my own place.

07:04.543 --> 07:06.077
Guys, mi casa es su casa.

07:06.111 --> 07:08.112
- I even made you guys keys.
- What?

07:08.147 --> 07:09.781
Check these out.
That one's yours.

07:09.815 --> 07:11.182
Aw, it looks like a guitar.

07:11.216 --> 07:12.216
Yeah, that's 'cause you're rocking.

07:12.251 --> 07:13.518
Mine's a...

07:13.552 --> 07:15.286
It's a rainbow kissing a star.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.921
- You like it?
- Blah!

07:16.955 --> 07:18.089
Yeah.

07:18.123 --> 07:19.390
Guys, hang out here anytime you want.

07:19.425 --> 07:21.125
- Even now. Who's thirsty?
- Thanks.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.126
Right there.
Dude!

07:22.161 --> 07:23.895
- Shut up!
- Damn, man.

07:23.929 --> 07:25.563
You're like James Bond.

07:25.597 --> 07:27.031
But I'll be...
I'll be Moneypenny for sure.

07:27.065 --> 07:28.800
- Yeah.
- Wait, which one is Moneypenny?

07:28.834 --> 07:30.101
It's the woman.

07:30.135 --> 07:31.469
Oh.

07:33.605 --> 07:34.972
So, did the store have that, uh,

07:35.007 --> 07:36.274
bamboo highchair you were looking for?

07:36.308 --> 07:37.942
No, not the one I wanted.

07:37.976 --> 07:39.377
So I think I'm just gonna...

07:39.411 --> 07:41.479
Order it online.

07:41.513 --> 07:42.880
You still got it.

07:42.915 --> 07:44.382
You still got it.

07:44.416 --> 07:46.284
Big deal, I've been online, too.
I still got it.

07:46.318 --> 07:47.919
It's different.

07:47.953 --> 07:49.987
So, this is the problem.

07:50.022 --> 07:52.657
Nick didn't tell his ex
that we were together,

07:52.691 --> 07:55.560
and she found out, and now
she's really, really upset.

07:55.594 --> 07:56.828
This is the scariest one yet.

07:56.862 --> 07:58.663
It's just a bunch of smiley faces.

07:58.697 --> 08:01.399
Okay, um, not to be
all guy with a baby,

08:01.433 --> 08:04.769
but, uh, exes are really
a lot like newborns, okay?

08:04.803 --> 08:06.771
The burps can be so yucky,

08:06.805 --> 08:08.473
but you know what comes
after a burp?

08:08.507 --> 08:09.474
What?

08:09.508 --> 08:11.142
A big old smile.

08:11.176 --> 08:12.577
Aw.

08:12.611 --> 08:15.146
What the hell are you talking about?

08:15.180 --> 08:16.147
It was a metaphor, Nick.

08:16.181 --> 08:17.849
It was a classic fatherhood metaphor.

08:17.883 --> 08:20.384
No, my-my point is
you just need to face her

08:20.419 --> 08:22.420
and let her get it all off her chest.

08:22.454 --> 08:23.588
Oh, I feel like I've done that.

08:23.622 --> 08:24.856
No, you didn't.

08:24.890 --> 08:27.492
You just talked and talked
about nothing for 30 minutes.

08:27.526 --> 08:28.326
Okay, look, I know

08:28.360 --> 08:29.961
it's hard. I know that, man.

08:29.995 --> 08:31.796
I'm here and I'm hearing it.

08:31.830 --> 08:33.231
I mean, when Jess and I did this,

08:33.265 --> 08:35.533
I think we cried for, like...
two days?

08:35.567 --> 08:37.534
I mean, at least. But look.

08:37.568 --> 08:40.104
Now I have such a good friend,
and we talk all the time,

08:40.138 --> 08:41.339
and he's such a good listener.

08:41.373 --> 08:42.807
Say what? I can't hear you.

08:47.412 --> 08:49.146
Is this real?

08:49.181 --> 08:51.716
You guys saw each other naked,
and now you're friends?

08:51.750 --> 08:53.351
Yes, it's the purest form
of friendship.

08:53.385 --> 08:54.819
Straight Leno and Eubanks.

08:57.756 --> 09:00.057
I just want to say you're incredible,

09:00.092 --> 09:02.660
and I'm so lucky
to have you in my life.

09:04.196 --> 09:06.464
Okay, I took your advice.

09:06.498 --> 09:08.199
What do we got?

09:08.233 --> 09:11.769
"My bad. Let's be friends, 'kay?"

09:11.803 --> 09:13.604
Smooth, but tough.

09:13.639 --> 09:14.639
That's not good, Nick.

09:14.673 --> 09:16.541
Friendship is a, um...

09:16.575 --> 09:17.975
it's like a beautiful flower.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.977
You have to nourish it, okay?

09:20.012 --> 09:21.746
- You can't just buy it at a store.
- All right.

09:21.780 --> 09:24.582
First of all, it was a draft,
okay, and I'll fix it.

09:24.616 --> 09:26.918
And second of all,
with all due respect,

09:26.952 --> 09:30.354
you can buy a flower at a store.

09:30.389 --> 09:32.690
Millered!

09:34.563 --> 09:36.761
I know as an angel
you usually sleep in heaven,

09:36.795 --> 09:38.896
but would you care to spend
the evening at my place?

09:38.931 --> 09:41.532
I think maybe I would.

09:41.567 --> 09:43.734
Fantastic choice.

09:43.769 --> 09:45.403
Here's my address.

09:45.437 --> 09:47.471
There's usually no place to park.

09:49.141 --> 09:50.207
Well, so where would I...?

09:50.242 --> 09:51.709
You're a big girl.

09:51.743 --> 09:53.311
You'll figure it out.

09:58.150 --> 10:00.217
Uh, just tr-try south of Sixth.

10:00.252 --> 10:02.420
There's usually a string
of open spaces down there.

10:02.454 --> 10:05.923
And there's not a right turn
on red on Fifth, just FYI.

10:07.092 --> 10:08.859
Okay, here's the deal.

10:08.894 --> 10:10.761
I've been wanting to end things
with Claire for years now.

10:10.796 --> 10:12.496
And I'm gonna do it.
It's gonna take one phone call.

10:12.531 --> 10:14.532
- What? - She's gonna burn
all my clothes on the lawn.

10:14.566 --> 10:16.701
I don't care. I only want
to wear Henleys anyways.

10:16.735 --> 10:18.202
Jess, we can finally be together.

10:18.236 --> 10:19.203
What?!

10:19.237 --> 10:21.405
Wait, no, but leave your wife?!

10:21.440 --> 10:23.641
For you.
I'm gonna leave my wife for you.

10:23.675 --> 10:24.642
Wait, what...?

10:24.676 --> 10:26.544
"Thank you for being so incredible."

10:26.578 --> 10:28.279
"So lucky to have you in my life"?

10:28.313 --> 10:29.747
- Jess.
- Mm-mm.

10:29.781 --> 10:31.716
- When you said those words, I knew.
- No.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.384
Berkley, there's been a fundamental

10:33.418 --> 10:35.086
misunderstanding here.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.221
You know the last time
Claire thanked me for anything?

10:37.255 --> 10:39.890
It was when I was pulling out
her chair at our wedding.

10:39.925 --> 10:42.226
- No...
- She doesn't appreciate me like you do.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.928
No, it's not happening.
No, no...

10:43.962 --> 10:46.664
Aah! Damn it, Winston! Oh, God.

10:46.698 --> 10:49.000
Pretend this is attached,
and there's water coming out.

10:49.034 --> 10:51.035
Okay.

10:52.104 --> 10:53.237
No, not like that.

10:54.706 --> 10:55.673
It's not sexual!

10:55.707 --> 10:57.742
No! I'm not feeding you water!

10:57.776 --> 10:58.809
- Wet my mouth.
- No!

10:59.878 --> 11:01.278
Oh, hi.

11:01.313 --> 11:02.847
- Are you Schmidt's friend?
- What?

11:02.881 --> 11:04.248
Sch-Schmidt's friend?

11:04.282 --> 11:06.817
Where you at?
'Cause I'm ready to ea...

11:06.852 --> 11:08.419
Hey!

11:08.453 --> 11:10.921
My good friend... Frank...

11:10.956 --> 11:12.823
Scabopolis!

11:12.858 --> 11:14.659
Ah, give me a hug,
you Greek son of a bitch!

11:14.693 --> 11:15.693
- Come here!
- What?

11:18.864 --> 11:20.364
Where is this coming from?

11:20.399 --> 11:21.999
You. The phone calls, the texts,

11:22.034 --> 11:24.769
"Boyfriend problems,"
"I need you," hugs, kisses.

11:24.803 --> 11:26.270
- What?
- More hugs, more kisses.

11:26.304 --> 11:27.471
- I...
- You have been setting up

11:27.506 --> 11:29.306
dominoes for ten years.

11:29.341 --> 11:30.608
And now they are falling.

11:30.642 --> 11:32.009
You have a baby, sir!
I know.

11:32.044 --> 11:34.478
And you are gonna make
such a good stepmom.

11:34.513 --> 11:36.013
I love you, Jessica.

11:36.048 --> 11:37.648
God, it feels good
to say that out loud

11:37.683 --> 11:39.383
and not just to my sleeping wife.

11:39.418 --> 11:40.785
Guys, I need your help.

11:40.819 --> 11:42.319
You, hey!

11:42.354 --> 11:44.722
Nick was right about you,
and he can't know that,

11:44.756 --> 11:46.657
- so put a sock in it!
- What is wrong with me?

11:46.692 --> 11:47.792
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:47.826 --> 11:48.993
I keep trying to write to Caroline,

11:49.027 --> 11:50.061
but I'm choking.

11:50.095 --> 11:51.495
I can't get past "What's up, C?"

11:51.530 --> 11:53.564
Oh, that's her.

11:53.598 --> 11:55.499
It says,
"Come to the window, friend." Friend.

11:55.534 --> 11:57.668
- That's good. That's good.
- That's a good thing. Yeah.

11:57.703 --> 12:00.137
Caroline! Hey!

12:00.172 --> 12:03.541
You cheat on me and then
you want to be friends?!

12:03.575 --> 12:05.376
I'm just writing you an e-mail!

12:05.410 --> 12:06.877
It's-it's not sending!

12:06.912 --> 12:09.313
Look, gonna throw it down,
but I need my phone back!

12:09.347 --> 12:11.315
- We talk now!
- Caroline! Hey!

12:12.584 --> 12:13.250
Stop!

12:13.285 --> 12:14.552
Really excited to...

12:14.586 --> 12:16.220
- No!
- ...talk to you guys.

12:16.254 --> 12:17.755
Hey, stop! That's not my car!

12:17.789 --> 12:20.224
Tell Jess I said hi.

12:20.258 --> 12:21.692
No, Caroline,

12:21.727 --> 12:23.260
I parked down the street!

12:23.295 --> 12:25.563
It... Why am I telling you?!

12:27.258 --> 12:29.359
At least she can't get
into the building.

12:29.393 --> 12:31.228
Okay, what am I gonna do here?

12:31.262 --> 12:32.629
She cut off the power.

12:32.663 --> 12:34.264
No, Nick, that was you.
You turned off the light.

12:34.298 --> 12:35.532
All the other lights
are still on.

12:35.566 --> 12:37.434
My bad. Thank you.

12:37.468 --> 12:39.603
I know you're scared.
Let me be brave.

12:39.637 --> 12:41.271
You should go because you have a wife,

12:41.305 --> 12:43.373
and you have a baby,
and you love them.

12:43.407 --> 12:45.342
Jess, what are you, crazy?

12:45.376 --> 12:46.343
It's not safe out there.

12:46.377 --> 12:47.878
Berkley can't go.
He stays here.

12:47.912 --> 12:48.612
- I don't think that...
- Thank you, Nick.

12:48.646 --> 12:50.714
You're very welcome.

12:50.748 --> 12:52.449
I'll be with you in just
one second, all right?

12:52.483 --> 12:54.451
- Mm-hmm.
- And don't drink the water by the bed.

12:54.485 --> 12:56.186
It's got my contacts in it.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.488
Okay.

12:58.523 --> 12:59.823
What are you doing?

12:59.857 --> 13:02.058
- What are you doing?
- And t-tell her that I'd like

13:02.093 --> 13:03.627
to be reimbursed
for those strawberries.

13:03.661 --> 13:05.695
- What...? Dude.
- Why is she calling you Schmidt?

13:05.730 --> 13:07.464
I told her my name was Schmidt
in case we saw your mail.

13:07.498 --> 13:08.932
I don't just leave mail out.

13:08.966 --> 13:10.967
This isn't a small business.
Get out.

13:11.002 --> 13:13.103
Dude, I'm about to seal the deal.
I'm not getting out.

13:13.137 --> 13:15.138
I'm about to...
I'm-I'm a deal sealer.

13:15.173 --> 13:16.373
I'm about to get some squish, dude,

13:16.407 --> 13:17.941
and you need to not
get in between that.

13:17.975 --> 13:19.810
I'm about to nail it into the wall.

13:19.844 --> 13:21.678
Dude, I'm about to take down
that va-dragon.

13:21.712 --> 13:24.414
I'm about to pin the tail
on the va-donkey, dude.

13:24.448 --> 13:26.283
You better not stand
in the way of this.

13:26.317 --> 13:28.084
Don't call her a va-donkey.
I don't even know her well

13:28.119 --> 13:29.953
and I want her to leave,
but please don't call her

13:29.987 --> 13:31.154
- a va-d... va-donkey.
- I won't. All right.

13:31.189 --> 13:33.523
Please. I need this.

13:33.558 --> 13:35.225
Okay, fine.

13:35.259 --> 13:37.060
I will use the guest room.

13:37.094 --> 13:38.829
- Yes.
- Like an animal.

13:38.863 --> 13:40.997
Oh, yes.

13:41.032 --> 13:42.499
Oh! Winston!

13:42.533 --> 13:43.500
What are you doing?!

13:43.534 --> 13:45.135
Oh, we were just playing a game.

13:45.169 --> 13:47.037
You know, Bad Cop, Black Cop?

13:47.071 --> 13:48.638
It's me, Bertie!

13:55.713 --> 13:58.315
Um, I might have been
wrong about some things,

13:58.349 --> 13:59.549
um, some Berkley things.

13:59.584 --> 14:01.017
Hey, the screaming stopped.

14:01.052 --> 14:02.886
I knew she'd run out of gas.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.387
- "My bad"?!
- What?

14:04.422 --> 14:05.989
"Let's be friends, 'kay"?!

14:06.023 --> 14:08.325
You couldn't even write out "okay"?!

14:08.359 --> 14:09.860
It's go time, Nick.

14:09.894 --> 14:11.161
Time to break out that burp cloth.

14:11.195 --> 14:12.562
Jess, let's give him some space...

14:12.597 --> 14:13.697
by going to a motel.

14:13.731 --> 14:15.465
I don't love you.

14:15.499 --> 14:17.234
I got a slight beer buzz.
Let's do it.

14:17.268 --> 14:18.335
Yeah, don't go.

14:18.369 --> 14:19.469
I thought you wanted me
to talk to her.

14:19.503 --> 14:20.670
Don't go right now.

14:20.705 --> 14:22.239
I'm sorry.
You don't love me?

14:22.273 --> 14:23.306
Say it again?

14:23.341 --> 14:24.641
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

14:24.675 --> 14:26.076
Oh... What?!

14:26.110 --> 14:28.845
Then why have you led
me on for ten years?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.513
Oh, hell on Earth no!

14:30.548 --> 14:32.549
Oh, my God, I was right.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.751
- He wants to bone you.
- Oh, come on, Nick!

14:34.785 --> 14:36.186
Caroline, I'll be right there.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.089
I'm so sorry, Berkley.
You got cut off.

14:39.123 --> 14:40.390
- Thank you, sir.
- No.

14:40.424 --> 14:41.791
May, 2004.

14:41.826 --> 14:44.594
You brushed my hand
at Dave Matthews concert

14:44.629 --> 14:46.429
- during "Two Step."
- "Two Step"?

14:46.464 --> 14:48.598
- Oh, my God.
- Or that time that I helped you move,

14:48.633 --> 14:50.100
and I came over,
I was wearing sweatpants.

14:50.134 --> 14:52.335
You couldn't stop staring at my rig.

14:52.370 --> 14:53.503
She loves looking at rigs.

14:53.537 --> 14:55.038
Why are you calling it a rig?!

14:55.072 --> 14:56.072
You're doing it again.

14:56.107 --> 14:57.407
One second, Caroline!

14:57.441 --> 14:58.975
Open this door!

15:03.781 --> 15:05.949
You think I wear this
sweater because I like it?

15:05.983 --> 15:07.017
It's a handsome sweater.

15:07.051 --> 15:08.685
- That's right, I love you.
- No!

15:08.719 --> 15:09.853
What do you mean, no?

15:09.887 --> 15:11.087
Ooh!

15:11.122 --> 15:13.390
Open the door!
Come on!

15:13.424 --> 15:14.691
Schmidt?

15:14.725 --> 15:16.192
You said to me that I was incredible

15:16.227 --> 15:18.628
and you were so lucky,
and now here we are,

15:18.663 --> 15:20.430
we're trying to hook up
Nick with his ex-girlfriend.

15:20.464 --> 15:21.932
I mean, that's what this is, right?

15:21.966 --> 15:23.233
No, it isn't.
That's not what...

15:23.267 --> 15:24.534
So let's just do it, come on.

15:24.568 --> 15:25.535
- Hey, hey,
- Berkley, Berkley!

15:25.569 --> 15:26.770
- Oh, no!
- No, no!

15:26.804 --> 15:28.638
- No, what are you doing?
- Oh, no.

15:28.673 --> 15:30.707
- 'Kay!
- Oh, hey!

15:30.741 --> 15:33.243
- Car-o-line.
- Yeah...

15:33.277 --> 15:36.680
You stole my boyfriend.

15:39.951 --> 15:41.985
Schmidt?

15:42.019 --> 15:43.420
Be right there!

15:43.454 --> 15:45.722
That should buy us some time.
Coach, you stay with your girl

15:45.756 --> 15:48.224
who thinks that you're me in my bedroom.
Winston, you stay

15:48.259 --> 15:49.359
in the guest room with Bertie doing

15:49.393 --> 15:50.794
whatever the hell it is
you guys are doing.

15:50.828 --> 15:52.095
- Gross.
- I'm gonna keep Sarah...

15:52.129 --> 15:54.364
Almost there!

15:54.398 --> 15:55.799
I'm gonna keep Sarah
in the living room,

15:55.833 --> 15:58.635
using one of the
living-dining-open-floor-plan bang spots.

15:58.669 --> 16:01.604
Now, no exits, no entrances,
no Noises Off baloney.

16:01.639 --> 16:02.605
Capeesh?

16:02.640 --> 16:04.107
Confirm my capeesh!

16:04.141 --> 16:05.442
Capeesh!

16:05.476 --> 16:06.943
- Let's go. Do it.
- All right.

16:06.978 --> 16:08.745
- Guys, guys!
- Right.

16:08.779 --> 16:11.114
This is the exact type of
baloney that I'm talking about.

16:11.148 --> 16:13.917
Unbelievable. Guys, guys!

16:13.951 --> 16:15.618
I'm really glad that we're doing this.

16:15.653 --> 16:17.654
- Okay.
- All right.

16:17.688 --> 16:19.589
I did not steal your boyfriend.

16:19.623 --> 16:20.857
Timeline. Now.

16:20.891 --> 16:24.027
Okay, um...
you and Nick break up.

16:24.061 --> 16:25.595
London has a great Olympics.

16:25.629 --> 16:26.963
Uh-oh, trouble in Syria.

16:26.998 --> 16:28.164
Board up your windows.

16:28.199 --> 16:30.033
Superstorm Sandy.

16:30.067 --> 16:32.369
Hey, over here.

16:32.403 --> 16:33.703
Me and Nick get together.

16:33.738 --> 16:34.971
And here's that beautiful
Sunday in the park

16:35.006 --> 16:36.439
that you and I went to,
and we have a wonderful Sunday.

16:36.474 --> 16:38.908
- Shut up, Berkley!
- No, you shut up, Jess.

16:38.943 --> 16:40.243
Don't take this out on Jess.

16:40.277 --> 16:41.378
Oh, oh, right, it's the beginning,

16:41.412 --> 16:42.779
so you're being all supportive now.

16:42.813 --> 16:44.881
He's still trying.
I mean, I bet he's still

16:44.915 --> 16:46.249
laughing at all your jokes, right?

16:46.283 --> 16:49.352
Well... I have a great
instinct for comedy.

16:49.387 --> 16:51.221
All right, well, you know what,
you enjoy all that

16:51.255 --> 16:53.723
while it lasts,
because I'll tell you what.

16:53.758 --> 16:56.359
It's not gonna be long before he stops

16:56.394 --> 16:58.695
holding your hand
and starts high-fiving you

16:58.729 --> 17:01.197
and he stops letting you be
the little spoon and he starts

17:01.232 --> 17:04.067
drifting off during
important conversations.

17:04.101 --> 17:05.702
Are you listening right now?

17:05.736 --> 17:07.804
What's that?

17:07.838 --> 17:09.839
- Seriously, Nick?
- Jess, you're the girlfriend now,

17:09.874 --> 17:12.675
but one day
you're gonna be the ex.

17:12.710 --> 17:14.743
And two years after
he breaks up with you,

17:14.779 --> 17:16.613
he still won't tell you why.

17:18.682 --> 17:20.183
Um, okay, well,

17:20.217 --> 17:22.585
um... this has been a really, um,

17:22.619 --> 17:25.255
neat talk, so, um...

17:25.289 --> 17:29.025
I'm gonna go... sit in the shower,

17:29.060 --> 17:31.061
and, um, go over
the greatest hits in my mind.

17:31.095 --> 17:32.529
I'll just be right here,

17:32.563 --> 17:34.731
picturing the whole sudsy thing.

17:34.765 --> 17:37.100
Hey, hey, ho, I'm right here.
How about a little respect?

17:37.134 --> 17:39.169
I know. What, you...
This is obviously happening.

17:39.203 --> 17:40.336
No, it's not!

17:40.371 --> 17:41.704
Where's your brain?

17:43.656 --> 17:45.390
Hey, Jess, you okay?

17:47.960 --> 17:50.228
No.

17:50.262 --> 17:53.398
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

17:53.432 --> 17:56.067
I've led a very fortunate life.

17:56.101 --> 17:57.302
Look, Jess, you were right.

17:57.336 --> 17:58.736
No, you were right.

17:58.771 --> 18:00.405
I feel like such a fool.

18:00.439 --> 18:02.840
You were right
about everything.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.309
No, I wasn't.

18:04.343 --> 18:06.978
Caroline deserves to know why I left.

18:08.113 --> 18:09.347
And you should hear, too.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.754
- I'm thirsty! Stop! Let me go, boy!
- No, no, no, come, come...

18:16.789 --> 18:18.356
Whoa!

18:18.390 --> 18:19.590
Who the hell are you?

18:19.625 --> 18:21.592
Who the hell are you?

18:21.627 --> 18:22.927
Schmidt.
What?

18:22.962 --> 18:24.162
Frank Scabopolis is up in here

18:24.196 --> 18:25.296
making out with some bitch.

18:25.331 --> 18:26.597
That's not necessary.

18:26.632 --> 18:28.866
I mean...
Who's Frank Scabopolis?

18:28.901 --> 18:30.935
Aren't you Schmidt?!
I-I am Schmidt.

18:30.970 --> 18:32.704
- I thought you were Schmidt.
- I am Schmidt.

18:32.738 --> 18:35.206
Uh...
Uh, w-we're brothers.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.542
We are, we're-we're brothers.
What an upbringing that was.

18:37.576 --> 18:38.910
Yeah, same mom, different dads.

18:38.944 --> 18:40.611
One browner.

18:40.646 --> 18:43.848
Then who the hell is Frank Scabopolis?

18:43.882 --> 18:45.483
Yeah.

18:45.517 --> 18:48.019
I am Frank Scabopolis!

18:49.555 --> 18:51.956
Is this helping, Schmidt?
I forgot the plan.

18:51.991 --> 18:54.392
- Winston, please shut up.
- Plan? What plan?!

18:54.426 --> 18:56.494
I... there's no plan.
I know nothing about a plan.

18:56.528 --> 18:58.896
Is this some little
nasty group sex games

18:58.931 --> 19:00.665
y'all got going on up in here?

19:00.699 --> 19:03.234
Been a couple years, but... I'm down.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.702
I didn't want to know that.

19:04.737 --> 19:05.903
I am out of here.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.739
- I'm way ahead of you.
- No, no, please!

19:07.773 --> 19:10.541
Sarah, please, wait!
I can... ugh.

19:10.576 --> 19:12.477
Just...

19:12.511 --> 19:14.912
Well, I'm gonna go back to bed.

19:14.947 --> 19:18.016
Schmidt, that mattress is heaven.

19:18.050 --> 19:20.518
It's pretty good.

19:20.552 --> 19:21.853
See?

19:21.887 --> 19:24.222
You don't think I'm
scary, do you, baby?

19:24.256 --> 19:25.723
- Oh, whoa!
- Oh!

19:25.758 --> 19:26.724
No. Hey, no.

19:26.759 --> 19:28.026
- I was just kidding.
- No.

19:28.060 --> 19:29.394
Hey, Caroline, there's
something I need to say.

19:29.428 --> 19:30.628
Nick, you don't have to do this.

19:30.662 --> 19:32.096
No, I-I do.

19:32.131 --> 19:35.266
Look, I never cheated on you,
but I might as well have.

19:36.535 --> 19:37.902
See, I fell in love with Jess

19:37.936 --> 19:39.270
the moment she walked
through the door.

19:40.739 --> 19:42.540
- Boo!
- Really?

19:42.574 --> 19:44.342
Sorry.

19:44.376 --> 19:46.511
The moment I walked through the door?

19:46.545 --> 19:47.678
Really?

19:47.713 --> 19:50.948
'Cause I thought I annoyed you.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.150
Can we do this later, please?

19:52.184 --> 19:53.418
- It's just not a good...
- Yeah, okay. Got it, yup.

19:53.452 --> 19:54.852
Got it.

19:54.887 --> 19:56.454
Caroline, she's the reason that I left.

19:57.890 --> 19:59.490
I always thought that it was Jess.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.693
I'm glad I'm not crazy.

20:02.728 --> 20:03.928
Well...

20:03.962 --> 20:05.129
Hmm.

20:05.164 --> 20:06.798
Thanks for telling me the truth.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.332
Oh, I'm just sorry
it didn't happen sooner.

20:08.367 --> 20:09.967
- Don't touch me.
- I'm so sorry.

20:10.002 --> 20:11.035
I was kidding.

20:11.070 --> 20:12.937
There's that famous Milwaukee humor.

20:12.971 --> 20:14.439
I'm not from Milwaukee.

20:14.473 --> 20:15.807
You honestly scare me.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.308
Good-bye, Nick.

20:17.342 --> 20:18.443
Bye.

20:18.477 --> 20:19.577
Hey.

20:19.611 --> 20:21.579
Look, Berkley, um,

20:21.613 --> 20:24.315
I'm so sorry that you got
the wrong idea about us.

20:25.684 --> 20:27.485
You were right.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.420
I did play some part in it.

20:29.455 --> 20:31.022
Thank you.

20:32.091 --> 20:33.991
- Good luck, Jessica.
- Thanks.

20:34.026 --> 20:35.560
See you later, bud.

20:36.962 --> 20:38.796
I really don't want
to go back to my wife.

20:38.831 --> 20:40.498
Do you guys want
to play cards or something...

20:40.532 --> 20:42.300
- Go. Just go.
- Get out of here.

20:48.407 --> 20:50.041
The moment I walked
through that door, huh?

20:50.075 --> 20:52.009
Just be cool about it.

20:52.044 --> 20:54.445
'Cause for me, it was way later.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.980
- Yeah, I know.
- Like, a lot later...

20:56.014 --> 20:58.950
Oh, come here already.

20:58.984 --> 21:00.017
You could use that for something.

21:00.052 --> 21:01.419
- That's the "Glass Menagerie."
- Yeah.

21:01.453 --> 21:02.854
I'll sit her down
right on top of that.

21:02.888 --> 21:04.088
Oh, absolutely.

21:04.123 --> 21:05.556
The, uh, "Star 68."

21:05.591 --> 21:06.624
Where's that at?

21:06.658 --> 21:08.092
- Right there on that pillow.
- Oh.

21:08.127 --> 21:09.327
- Wow.
- The "Jumanji."

21:09.361 --> 21:11.195
Yeah, you do the...
the "U Lock" on here.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.196
That'd be cool.

21:12.231 --> 21:13.631
The "Jean-Michel Basquiat."

21:13.665 --> 21:14.632
Oh, okay.

21:14.666 --> 21:15.833
The "Fabric Softener."

21:15.868 --> 21:17.602
That's the "Kansas City Shaker."

21:17.636 --> 21:19.370
- This, right here? I like that.
- Yeah.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.872
Back there, that's the "Nia Vardalos."

21:20.906 --> 21:22.273
- Ooh. That's nice, dude.
- Nice.

21:22.307 --> 21:24.275
That one's "Sex on the Rug,"

21:24.309 --> 21:27.667
which is... and, again,
it's pretty obvious.

21:27.849 --> 21:30.084
But that's... you know,
why mess with a classic?
