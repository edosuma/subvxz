PLEASE, BE COMFORTABLE. THE

02:10.797 --> 02:14.631
BE COMFORTABLE IN THE SENSE THAT
THERE'S NO NEED TO STAND ON CEREMONY.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.963
BUT THERE ARE NO SEATS
TO SIT DOWN ON, EITHER.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.719
I'VE HEARD MUCH
OF YOU, DOCTOR.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.469
AND I OF YOU, AND THAT'S
THE REASON YOU'RE HERE.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.223
YOU'VE BEEN AN ASTRONAUT
FOR 11 YEARS.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.430
IS THAT A QUESTION, SIR?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.982
<i>IT'S AN OBSERVATION. SHOULD
YOU NOT HAVE REALIZED IT,</i>

02:32.027 --> 02:35.486
YOU'VE BEEN THE OBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE
OBSERVATION FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.563
I'VE BEEN AWARE
OF SOME, DOCTOR.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.741
WHEN THE SPACE AGENCY
PUT ME ON MY PROJECT,

02:40.827 --> 02:43.990
THEY TOLD ME TO KEEP IN MIND
THE SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS,

02:44.081 --> 02:46.664
BUT ALSO TO BE AWARE
OF THE HUMAN FACTOR.

02:46.750 --> 02:50.994
<i>YOU, COMMANDER STANSFIELD,
ARE THE HUMAN FACTOR.</i>

02:51.088 --> 02:53.250
GO ON, DOCTOR.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.050
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS,
DON'T YOU?

03:02.140 --> 03:05.007
VVELL, THIS IS OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.
THIS IS THE SUN

03:05.102 --> 03:08.561
AND HERE IS THE EARTH,
JUPITER, \/ENUS, PLUTO, MARS.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.514
<i>AND WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
OUR NEKSHBORS, COMMANDER?</i>

03:11.566 --> 03:13.398
MARS IS A VAST,
SCRUBBY DESERT

03:13.485 --> 03:15.271
WITH AN UNBREATHABLE
ATMOSPHERE.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.900
<i>PLUTO IS POISONOUS
AND EXTREMELY COLD.</i>

03:18.990 --> 03:21.197
<i>THE MOON IS BARREN,
JUPITER, VOLCANIC.</i>

03:21.243 --> 03:23.200
IN SHORT, COMMANDER,

03:23.286 --> 03:26.369
OUR NEIGHBORS OFFER US ONLY ONE
ASSET: THEY'RE ACCESSIBLE.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.281
<i>THEY'RE WITHIN REACH.</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:31.288
<i>BEYOND THAT,
THEY OFFER US NOTHING.</i>

03:31.378 --> 03:34.621
SCIENTIFIC, SOCIAL,
ECONOMIC. ANYTHING.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.420
THEY'RE THE MOUNT
EVEREST OF SPACE.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.296
ONCE, THEY OFFERED
US CHALLENGES.

03:40.387 --> 03:43.379
WHERE IS THE NEXT
MOUNT EVEREST, DOCTOR?

03:43.432 --> 03:47.596
THAT'S PERHAPS THE MOST PERTINENT
QUESTION YOU'VE EVER ASKED.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.644
THIS IS A
PLANETARY SYSTEM.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.814
TO DATE SEEN ONLY THROUGH
THE LENS OF A TELESCOPE.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.733
VVE KNOVV NOTHING OF IT EXCEPT
THAT THERE ARE SIX BODIES,

03:56.778 --> 03:59.987
ONE OF VVHICH VVE CAN
ONLY ASSUME IS THE SUN.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.565
IT'S FLAMING
AND GASEOUS,

04:02.617 --> 04:06.281
AND IT MUST PROVIDE HEAT AND LIGHT
FOR THESE Fl\/E BODIES HERE.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.578
IT'S A SMALL SYSTEM
LIKE OUR OWN.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.752
THE PLANETS RUN ROUGHLY IN
THE SAME ORBITAL PATTERN

04:11.793 --> 04:13.659
AS WE DO AROUND
OUR OWN SUN.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.461
DOES IT HAVE A NAME?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.834
YOU MAY CALL IT
STANSFIELD'S MOUNT EVEREST.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.257
THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.135
WHEN?

04:23.221 --> 04:26.339
IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS. THE
SHIP'S BEING BUILT NOVV.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.767
IT'S OFF THE DRAVVING BOARD.
THE KEEL IS BEING LAID.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.520
BUT IT'LL TAKE ONLY ONE MAN, AND
THAT MAN SHOULD BE RIGHT THERE

04:33.607 --> 04:36.144
WATCHING EVERY
RIVET, EVERY BOLT,

04:36.234 --> 04:39.352
EVERY ITEM OF EQUIPMENT
GOING IN THERE.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.778
YOU ARE THAT
MAN, COMMANDER.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.527
<i>YOU WILL BE THE
SOLE OCCUPANT</i>

04:44.618 --> 04:46.359
<i>AND YOU WILL
BE ITS PILOT.</i>

04:46.453 --> 04:48.444
DOCTOR, I--

04:48.497 --> 04:51.285
I LIKE THIS
ASSIGNMENT VERY MUCH.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.708
THAT'S PRECISELY
WHY YOU WERE CHOSEN.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.789
OF COURSE, THERE VVILL BE THE USUAL
DANGERS, THE USUAL UNKNOVVNS.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.795
IN THE PAST, YOU'VE HAD METEOR
SHOWERS TO CONTEND VVITH.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.298
YOU'VE HAD THE USUAL CALCULATED
RISK OF MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES,

05:05.388 --> 05:08.631
LANDING DIFFICULTIES, EJECTION
TROUBLES AND THE REST OF IT.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.721
<i>WELL, YOU'LL STILL
HAVE THOSE.</i>

05:11.812 --> 05:13.974
<i>COMPOUNDED.</i>

05:14.022 --> 05:16.354
WE HAVE ANOTHER
FACTOR HERE.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.557
ANOTHER PROBLEM.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.689
DISTANCE.

05:20.779 --> 05:25.194
DISTANCE. THIS SYSTEM IS PERHAPS
141 LIGHT YEARS AVVAY FROM US.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.536
THAT'S A ROUGH ESTIMATE,
BUT A GOOD ONE.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.109
THE SHIP lS--

05:29.204 --> 05:31.161
THE SHIP WILL HAVE
INTERSTELLAR DRIVE

05:31.248 --> 05:33.080
AND AN
ANTIGRAVITY DEVICE.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.500
IT'LL BE THE FASTEST MAN-MADE
OBJECT EVER CONCEIVED,

05:36.545 --> 05:38.536
EVER BROUGHT TO LIFE.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.339
IT'LL GO 7O TIMES FASTER
THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.668
BUT IN TERMS OF THE
SPACE YOU MUST CONQUER.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.676
IT'LL BE LIKE AN ANT
CRAWLING ACROSS THE SAHARA.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.848
IN SHORT, COMMANDER,

05:51.935 --> 05:55.849
YOUR TRIP TO THESE PLANETARY
BODIES AND BACK TO EARTH

05:55.897 --> 05:59.936
WILL TAKE
APPROXIMATELY 4O YEARS.

06:03.238 --> 06:06.105

THE FIRST STEP TOVVARD MAN'S
LONGEST LEAP INTO THE UNKNOVVN.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.079
SCIENCE HAS SOLVED
THE MECHANICAL DETAILS,

06:22.173 --> 06:23.880
AND NOW IT'S UP
TO ONE HUMAN BEING

06:23.967 --> 06:26.550
TO BREATHE LIFE INTO
BLUEPRINTS AND COMPUTERS,

06:26.636 --> 06:29.549
TO PROVE ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT
MAN CAN LI\/E HALF A LIFETIME

06:29.598 --> 06:33.887

4O YEARS ALONE IN THE UNKNOVVN.

06:33.935 --> 06:37.473

LIES A PLANETARY SYSTEM.

06:37.564 --> 06:41.603

<i>[slow, steady heartbeat]</i>

06:59.252 --> 07:01.334

<i>THERE HAD BEEN NO TIME FOR INTRUSIONS
THAT TOOK THE FORM OF A WOMAN'S FACE,</i>

12:39.759 --> 12:43.969
<i>A VOICE, A SHORT MONTH OF A MAN

12:44.055 --> 12:47.093
<i>BECOMING A PART
OF ONE ANOTHER,</i>

12:47.141 --> 12:52.261
<i>REACHING TENTATIVELY INTO THAT
STRANGE AND MYSTERIOUS POND OF LOVE</i>

12:58.987 --> 13:02.105
<i>BUT NOW I THINK
OF THESE THINGS.</i>

13:02.198 --> 13:07.284
<i>NOW THEY COME TO MIND, NOW IN THE
DARKNESS, IN THE COLD, THE SOLITUDE,</i>

13:07.370 --> 13:10.032
<i>THE...STILLNESS,</i>

13:10.123 --> 13:12.615

<i>NOW THERE COMES
A FEELING OF WARMTH.</i>

17:12.114 --> 17:15.857
GENERAL VVALTERS? SPACE CONTACT, SIR.
A CRAFT SPIRALING IN.

17:15.910 --> 17:18.117
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
HEAR THE REPORT.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.741
AN EXPEDITION CALLED
STANSFIELD'S MOUNT EVEREST.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.413
COMMANDED BY
DOUGLAS STANSFIELD.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.036
WHAT WAS THE DATE
OF DEPARTURE?

17:24.126 --> 17:26.742
THIS ONE'S ONE
OF THE OLD JOBS, SIR.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.044
DEPARTURE,
DECEMBER 31,1987.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.714
"OLD" IS
PUTTING IT MILDLY.

17:31.759 --> 17:35.798
ALL RIGHT, CHECK IT OUT IN YOUR REPORT.
LET ME KNOVV.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.095
<i>THIS ONE'S ONE
OF THE PIONEERS.</i>

17:38.182 --> 17:39.764
<i>BEEN IN SPACE
4O YEARS.</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:42.387
FIRST VOICE
COMMUNICATION WE'VE HAD.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.139
IT'S BEEN
TRACKED ON RADAR,

17:44.230 --> 17:46.688
BUT HIS COMMUNICATIONS
MUST HAVE MALFUNCTIONED

17:46.774 --> 17:49.141
A FEW HOURS AFTER
HE LEFT THE ATMOSPHERE.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.397
NOW, HERE'S
A FUNNY ONE.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.278
HOW'S THAT, SIR?

17:54.365 --> 17:57.574
WELL, THERE'S AN INSERTION
FROM A MAN NAMED BIXLER.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.953
HE VVAS ONE OF THE PROJECT PEOPLE
YEARS AND YEARS AGO AS I RECALL.

18:02.039 --> 18:05.782
HE MUST HA\/E BEEN IN CHARGE
OF THE STANSFIELD MISSION.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.618
IT SAYS WE'RE
TO CONTACT

18:08.713 --> 18:11.831
A GIRL NAMED
SANDRA HORN.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.426
WHO?

18:13.467 --> 18:15.595
A MISS SANDRA HORN,

18:15.636 --> 18:17.673
A FRIEND OF
COMMANDER STANSFIELD.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.754
WHERE WOULD WE
FIND HER, SIR?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.923
AN OLD LADY'S HOME?

18:22.018 --> 18:25.261
NO, YOU'LL FIND HER
IN A HIBERNATION ROOM.

18:25.313 --> 18:30.934
YOU'LL FIND HER A YOUNG
VVOMAN OF 26 YEARS OF AGE.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.646
I HOPE YOU
FIND HER ALIVE.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.038
GENERAL WALTERS.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.995
MISS HORN.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.127
YOU'RE LOOKING VERY VVELL INDEED.
YOU LOOK FINE.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.130
SOUNDS IDIOTIC,
DOESN'T IT? BUT,

18:58.179 --> 19:02.138
VVHAT DO YOU SAY TO SOMEBODY
VVHO'S BEEN ASLEEP FOR 4O YEARS?

19:02.183 --> 19:04.515
I WAS TOLD
COMMANDER STANSFIELD--

19:04.602 --> 19:07.640
YES, HIS SHIP LANDED
SIX HOURS AGO.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.146
I ASKED TO SEE YOU.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.064
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.733
IN GOOD HEALTH.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.231
NATURALLY...VERY TIRED.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.485
I WANT TO SEE HIM.
I MUST SEE HIM.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.570
YOU SHALL SEE HIM
IN JUST A MOMENT.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.403
L-| HAD TO SPEAK
TO YOU FIRST.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.666
I'LL TRY TO MAKE THIS
AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.544
COMMANDER STANSFIELD SUFFERED
A COMMUNICATIONS FAILURE.

19:33.631 --> 19:38.546
IT PROBABLY OCCURRED VVITHIN THE
FIRST 12 HOURS AFTER HIS DEPARTURE.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.593
THERE WAS ONLY
SPORADIC CONTACT MADE

19:40.680 --> 19:43.843
DURING THE ENTIRE FLIGHT
BOTH THERE AND BACK.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.100
HE REACHED THE OTHER
SOLAR SYSTEM?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.052
YES, HE REACHED IT.

19:49.146 --> 19:52.184
HE LANDED, HE TOOK
OFF, HE RETURNED.

19:52.274 --> 19:56.609
HE FOUND NO LIFE. BUT VVE
FOUND THAT 2O YEARS AGO.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.405
THAT'S ONE OF THE IRONIES
OF PROGRESS, MISS HORN.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.698
COULD HAVE
SAVED THE TRIP.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.860
COULD HAVE SAVED HIM

20:05.913 --> 20:07.278
HIS ANGUISH.

20:07.373 --> 20:10.365
HIS ANGUISH BEING
THE FOLLOWING:

20:10.459 --> 20:12.917
UNKNOWN TO US
HERE ON EARTH,

20:13.003 --> 20:15.210
TO MY PREDECESSORS
AND TO THEIRS.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.379
BECAUSE OF THE LACK
OF COMMUNICATION,

20:17.425 --> 20:20.634
COMMANDER STANSFIELD
ARBITRARILY

20:20.720 --> 20:23.963
REMOVED HIMSELF
FROM HIBERNATION

20:24.056 --> 20:26.798
SIX MONTHS AFTER
LEAVING EARTH.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.766
<i>HE DID THIS BECAUSE--</i>

20:29.854 --> 20:32.061
I KNOW WHY.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.145
OH, GOD HELP ME.

20:37.945 --> 20:40.061
I KNOW WHY.

20:40.156 --> 20:44.070
OVER 4O YEARS,
MISS HORN.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.234
FORTY YEARS IN THE
COCKPIT OF A SHIP.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.285
FORTY YEARS.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.324
HIS LONELINESS
MUST HAVE BEEN

20:52.418 --> 20:56.753
SOMETHING BRAND-NEW
IN THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.831
I VVISH TO HEAVEN HE COULD HA\/E
RETURNED TO YOU JUST AS HE LEFT,

20:59.925 --> 21:02.417
BUT AS IT IS, HE--

21:42.927 --> 21:44.884
DOUG.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.340
YOU REMEMBER ME,
DON'T YOU?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.813
REMEMBER YOU?

21:57.441 --> 21:59.148
I'VE SPENT--

22:01.362 --> 22:04.980
I'VE SPENT 4O YEARS
REMEMBERING YOU, SANDY.

22:05.074 --> 22:08.658
PAINTING A PICTURE
INSIDE MY HEAD.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.658
LISTENING TO YOUR VOICE.

22:13.707 --> 22:17.746
THINKING ABOUT
YOUR TOUCH.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.669
I'VE SPENT

22:24.718 --> 22:26.584
FORTY YEARS

22:26.679 --> 22:29.512
SURVIVING FOR
YOU, SANDY.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.673
OH, DOUG.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.931
IT CAN STILL
BE THAT WAY.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.306
THE WAY YOU ARE.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.025
THE WAY I AM.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.021
IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE.

22:47.116 --> 22:49.778
OH, IT MAKES
A DIFFERENCE, SANDY.

22:49.869 --> 22:53.362
IT'S 4O YEARS DIFFERENCE.
THAT'S TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE.

23:34.413 --> 23:38.498
YOU ARE REALLY QUITE
AN INCREDIBLE MAN.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.793
