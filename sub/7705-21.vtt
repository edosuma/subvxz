and I'm stuck on Earth ¶

to my place of birth ¶

¶ Uh makin' the best
of a bad situation ¶

00:14.115 --> 00:16.715

an extended vacation ¶

00:16.717 --> 00:18.817
Yeah!

00:18.819 --> 00:21.787

lookin' for trouble ¶

00:21.789 --> 00:25.324
¶ I'm just here doing
the alien shuffle ¶

00:25.326 --> 00:27.493
Take it, Lynn.

¶ Well how do you do?
My name is Lynn ¶

¶ I'm doing some
rapping with an alien ¶

a little bit furry ¶

but I'm in a hurry ¶

Good. Good.

his name is Willie ¶

00:41.776 --> 00:44.576
¶ Come rap with us
let's all get silly ¶

¶ I'd love to ALF but
I'm uh got to get ready ¶

00:52.019 --> 00:53.685
¶ I just wanted to
tell Lynn.. ¶¶

00:53.687 --> 00:54.953
...that her mother
needed her.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.324
That isn't even close
to rhyming.

00:59.326 --> 01:01.693
I wasn't trying.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.763
ALF, you can come out now,
if you want.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.099
Hey, Willie, come here.
Listen to this.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.001
Let me know when
this gets irritating, okay?

01:09.003 --> 01:11.170
[ululating]

01:12.206 --> 01:13.839
Now! Now!

01:13.841 --> 01:16.842
It's irritating
almost at once.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.545
- What was that?
- Melmacian mating call.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.047
- Like it?
- It's charming.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.715
Does it have any effect?

01:23.717 --> 01:26.552
Oh, knocks 'em unconscious!

01:26.554 --> 01:29.855
I'd better go.
I'm beginning to feel faint.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.992
ALF, while we're gone

01:33.994 --> 01:36.428
I trust you won't be
getting into any mischief.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.231
- You do?
- Not really.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.000
But we gotta go.

01:44.839 --> 01:46.839
[ululating]

01:49.810 --> 01:51.410
- Come on. Come on.
- 'What? What?'

01:51.412 --> 01:52.811
Out of there. Out!

01:52.813 --> 01:55.881
What? Ah, geez, I never
do anything right.

Oh, Kate, I changed this lyric,
you want to listen to this?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.624
Mm-hmm.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.593

03:18.832 --> 03:21.266

feel more able ¶¶

03:21.268 --> 03:22.901
What was the change you made?

03:22.903 --> 03:26.171
Oh, I made, I changed, uh,
"According to<i> Aunt Mabel"</i>

03:26.173 --> 03:29.675
I changed to "We'll make you
feel<i> more able."</i>

03:29.677 --> 03:32.878
I liked Aunt Mabel better.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.613
I thought you were
watching "Wheel Of Fortune."

03:34.615 --> 03:37.616
I am. Buy a vowel!

03:39.086 --> 03:41.153
I-I guess maybe
there's another word

03:41.155 --> 03:42.421
that rhymes with table.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.591
There's grable, uh, gable,
uh, fable. Uh, fable..

03:45.593 --> 03:47.059
Oh, Willie, Willie,
this is a show

03:47.061 --> 03:48.727
for first graders,
and it's tonight.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.429
I don't think I'd make
any more big changes.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.799
Y-you're right,
<i> "more able"</i> stays.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.969
Fine, you're the writer.

03:56.971 --> 03:59.771
Vanna, honey, when
you stand sideways

03:59.773 --> 04:01.940
they can't see the letters!

04:03.777 --> 04:06.678
I'd better tell Brian
that Aunt Mabel is out.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.146
- Wh-where is he?
- I don't know.

04:08.148 --> 04:11.216
Oh, he's in the kitchen
boning the salmon.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.518
Oh, heh, I'll-I'll,
I'll tell him later.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.555
Now...now for my-my
dramatic verdian bridge.

04:16.557 --> 04:19.258
[piano music]

04:19.260 --> 04:21.493
Spin that sucker!

04:21.495 --> 04:22.894
What a wimp!

04:29.837 --> 04:31.737
Could you please
keep it down?

04:31.739 --> 04:34.172
Yeah, Willie,
have some consideration!

04:36.143 --> 04:38.777
ALF, ALF, this is
a very important show.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.213
I know, it's the semifinals.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.748
I'm not talking about
the "Wheel Of Fortune."

04:42.750 --> 04:44.716
I'm talking about
"The Nutrition Follies."

04:44.718 --> 04:45.817
Brian's school pageant.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.521
Now, if you don't mind!

04:49.523 --> 04:51.390
Boning the salmon?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.726
Here you go, ALF.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.328
Where's the head?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.163
Give that to me.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.066
You're not to eat boned salmon
in the living room.

05:01.068 --> 05:04.503
Fine. Who wants it
without the head, anyway?

05:04.505 --> 05:07.039
Brian, come here for a minute.
I made some changes in the song.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.174
I think this is gonna be
a lot easier for you.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.575
Le-let me show you.

05:10.577 --> 05:13.412
¶ Asparagus asparagus ¶

05:13.414 --> 05:15.547
¶ Put it on your table ¶

¶ Asparagus asparagus ¶

05:17.451 --> 05:20.385
¶ We'll make you
feel more able ¶¶

05:20.387 --> 05:23.689
- I liked Aunt Mabel.
- Forget it, kid.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.991
Aunt Mabel's history.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.660
Oh.. Uh, let's try
on your costume.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.162
It's too big.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.064
No, I made you a new one,
this one's smaller.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.166
Come on, let's see
how it looks.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.101
Hop in there.
There you go.

05:36.103 --> 05:40.005
There! You are an official
Aspara-guy. What do you think?

05:40.007 --> 05:43.342
Personally, I'm appalled
by the whole idea.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.311
On Melmac, we only
dressed as vegetables

05:46.313 --> 05:50.716
during periods of mourning
or when someone died.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.184
Well-well,
when someone dies here

05:52.186 --> 05:55.354
we-we generally wear dark
clothes, maybe a hat.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.989
A hat? To a funeral?

05:57.991 --> 06:00.559
When do you wear feathers?

06:00.561 --> 06:02.227
We don't.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.929
Barbarians.

06:04.898 --> 06:08.433
Oh, Brian!
You look so cute.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.770
You're gonna make
a great celery stalk.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.373
- He-he's an asparagus.
- Oh.

06:14.375 --> 06:18.009
I'd rather be a celery.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.512
Alright, everyone, uh,
we just got a few minutes now

06:20.514 --> 06:21.980
before the last rehearsal.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.582
So, Brian, why don't you
and I run over the song

06:23.584 --> 06:25.484
before Spencer gets here?

06:25.486 --> 06:27.252
Daddy, I don't want to.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.388
Brian, you were
so excited about this.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.991
I stink. Spencer says so.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.594
Oh, what do you care
what Spencer says?

06:35.596 --> 06:38.764
Because he laughs at me
and makes me forget the words.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.799
I don't like him. He's mean.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.835
Oh, Brian, that's not really..
That's not fair.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.639
I'm sure Spencer
has some very fine qualities.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.141
That's not what
you said last night.

06:49.143 --> 06:53.979
Well, maybe an unkind word
slipped in here or there.

06:53.981 --> 06:57.582
Willie, you said
the kid was fungus.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.684
I didn't..

06:59.686 --> 07:02.287
Even if I did,
that-that's not the point.

07:02.289 --> 07:03.789
What was the point?

07:03.791 --> 07:04.856
[car door closes]

07:04.858 --> 07:06.224
The point is moot.

07:06.226 --> 07:09.294
The little fungus
is here now.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.729
Right. Come on, ALF.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.899
Yeah, I know, 86 the alien.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.435
Let's go to my room.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.938
What about the salmon?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.541
- Forget about the salmon.
- Forgotten.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.347
Why would anyone
throw away the head?

07:29.349 --> 07:30.982
[doorbell dings]

07:30.984 --> 07:34.186
Remember, Brian,
don't let Spencer get to you.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.821
I'll try.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.924
Hi there, Spencer.

07:38.926 --> 07:42.327
Look what I got from my dad,
Dr. Potato Famine.

07:42.329 --> 07:46.331
- Wow! Can I look at it?
- No way. You might wreck it.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.099
From your, uh, father,
eh, Spence?

07:48.101 --> 07:49.501
He back in town again?

07:49.503 --> 07:52.838
Nope, Zurich. His secretary
sent this to me.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.573
But he told her to.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.008
Spencer, uh, why don't
we try on our costumes

07:57.010 --> 07:58.510
and we'll get started.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.012
- Where is it?
- I-it's right over here.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.749
You call that an asparagus?

08:04.751 --> 08:06.918
It looks like a zucchini.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.353
Uh, why don't we rehearse first

08:08.355 --> 08:10.922
and then we'll try
on the costumes, okay?

08:10.924 --> 08:15.927
Okay, but nobody touch this.
It's very expensive.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.597
I'll guard it with my life.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.466
Here's some material
I've written to open up the act.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.168
Uh, what act?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.570
Well, I thought I'd tell
some jokes to liven things up.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.573
Always open with comedy
and close with a song.

08:28.575 --> 08:31.209
Brian, uh, you want to
come over here, we'll try this.

08:34.781 --> 08:37.182
Let's see if you
get it right this time.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.219
Okay. Asparagus?

- Leave me alone.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.641
Guys, look, guys,
this is something

09:02.643 --> 09:04.242
that we're trying to do.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.744
We're trying to do
this together.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.346
This takes a lot of
cooperation.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.416
Let's-let's try it
right at the refrain.

09:11.418 --> 09:12.984
Right at the..
Let me just do this for you.

more able ¶¶

09:23.196 --> 09:24.629

to Aunt Mabel?

09:24.631 --> 09:27.866
- I changed it.
- You changed it?

09:27.868 --> 09:31.102
I changed it.
I think this has more impact.

09:31.104 --> 09:34.539
You see, nobody knows
who Aunt Ma..

09:34.541 --> 09:37.409
This is the way we're doing it,
and that's it.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.511
You're the writer.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.980

10:03.904 --> 10:06.304
No, "Bonanza" is just coming on.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.573
ALF, you've seen "Bonanza"
a hundred times.

10:08.575 --> 10:12.677
I know, but this is
one of the lost episodes.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.646
Please turn that off.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.880
Fine.

10:15.882 --> 10:16.915
[music stops]

10:16.917 --> 10:18.717
It's lost forever.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.021
No, Spencer, I'm sorry,
I don't think the jokes

10:23.023 --> 10:25.557
about your ex-wife will work.

10:25.559 --> 10:28.994
No. No priests, no rabbis,
and no ministers.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.664
No, Spencer,
the song stays as it is.

10:34.935 --> 10:37.836
Okay, everybody,
almost show time.

- Everybody ready?
- Just about.

Come on, Brian,
here's your costume.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.008
I don't wanna go.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.945
Brian, honey,
it'll be a lot of fun.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.647
All your friends
will be there.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.148
Yeah, they need you.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.018
Nobody needs asparagus.

Uh, William, may I have
a word with the boy?

10:57.157 --> 11:01.826
ALF, he's our son
and we'll handle this, alright?

11:01.828 --> 11:05.063
Fine. I'm a dot on the horizon.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.934
Brian, I know
that Spencer bothers you

11:09.936 --> 11:11.870
but you can't let that stop you.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.105
Now, 10, 20 years from today

11:14.107 --> 11:16.675
nobody will remember
"The Nutrition Follies"

11:16.677 --> 11:19.310
but you will remember
that you went out there

11:19.312 --> 11:22.113
you were the best asparagus
you could be.

11:22.115 --> 11:25.183
I don't care. I don't wanna
do it, I'm scared.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.318
Brian, lots of famous people
get stage fright

11:27.320 --> 11:28.787
before they have to sing.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.156
I read somewhere once
that Rod Stewart seizes up

11:31.158 --> 11:32.991
with stomach cramps
and hyperventilates and--

11:32.993 --> 11:34.659
(Kate)
'Lynn.'

11:34.661 --> 11:36.995
I'll wait in the car.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.264
So if you really, really
don't want to sing

11:39.266 --> 11:42.467
then, uh, we'll just sit
in the audience and watch.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.470
We'll take your costume just
in case you change your mind.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.505
Okay? Let's get in the car.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.411
Oh, good, you solved it
without me.

11:53.413 --> 11:56.247
Yes, we managed
to fumble through.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.551
So, uh, Brian,
you gonna sing?

11:59.553 --> 12:02.987
Not exactly,
but, uh, we are going.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.590
So you blew it.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.827
Listen, uh, I think I've got
a fix on the kid's problem.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.329
Mind if I talk
to him alone for a minute?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.698
Just, uh, keep it short.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.267
Come on over here, pal.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.204
We'll be in the car, Brian.

12:20.474 --> 12:23.007
- We are pals, aren't we?
- Yeah.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.976
So what's the problem?

12:24.978 --> 12:28.480
It's that Spencer guy,
isn't it?

12:28.482 --> 12:30.582
Let me tell you
a little story

12:30.584 --> 12:34.352
about a guy who had
the same problem you did.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.022
- A guy named Gordon.
- Who's he?

12:38.024 --> 12:40.658
Someone I grew up with
on Melmac.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.862
Nice kid, handsome..

12:43.864 --> 12:47.932
...intelligent,
great athlete..

12:47.934 --> 12:50.135
...wonderful sense of humor, ha!

12:50.137 --> 12:53.371
- It was you, wasn't it?
- How'd you guess?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.774
Anyway, I was doing a little--

12:55.776 --> 12:57.842
Your name's really Gordon?

12:57.844 --> 13:00.278
- Yeah, Gordon.
- That's funny.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.113
It was my mother's
maiden name, alright?

13:02.115 --> 13:03.148
Sorry.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.717
Anyway, back on Melmac

13:05.719 --> 13:07.786
I was in a little
dinner theater production

13:07.788 --> 13:09.954
of "Man of La Mancha."

13:09.956 --> 13:12.390
I was playing Sancho Panza.

13:12.392 --> 13:16.027
It was opening night.
There was a full house.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.229
I was about to sing
my first number

13:18.231 --> 13:21.232
when suddenly, I froze!

13:21.234 --> 13:22.767
I was like this.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.503
Yeah!

13:25.505 --> 13:28.540
Your name is really Gordon?

13:28.542 --> 13:31.075
Just go with me on this, okay?

13:31.077 --> 13:33.411
I'm up there, I'm frozen.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.980
I can't remember
my opening number.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.916
The audience
was getting hostile.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.985
They were ready to start
throwing bread sticks at me.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.254
When the guy who played
Don Quixote

13:43.256 --> 13:46.658
pulled me aside and gave me
this good luck charm.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.794
- A tooth?
- Yeah!

13:49.796 --> 13:52.530
His 124 year molar.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.032
Did it bring you good luck?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.834
Ha! You bet.

13:55.836 --> 13:59.204
I got through my song,
plus "The Impossible Dream"

13:59.206 --> 14:01.406
and every other song
in the show.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.542
For an encore I even did a
couple of numbers from "Gypsy."

14:06.613 --> 14:09.881
Yeah, but will it work
on asparagus songs?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.616
No problem.

14:11.618 --> 14:15.253
Don Quixote says the tooth
works on vegetables too.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.521
[car horn honking]

14:16.523 --> 14:19.123
Look, just stick
that in your back pocket

14:19.125 --> 14:22.260
and you'll go out there
and knock 'em dead.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.928
Great! I will.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.500
Thanks...Gordon.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.973
Don't worry, kid.
You'll be swell.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.908
You'll be great.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.911
¶ Gonna have the whole world
on a plate ¶

14:39.913 --> 14:41.246
¶ Starting here ¶

14:41.248 --> 14:42.547
¶ Starting now ¶

14:42.549 --> 14:44.349
¶ Honey everything's.. ¶¶

14:49.890 --> 14:51.456
Brian!

14:53.426 --> 14:57.662
Uh-oh. There's trouble,
right here in River City.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.904
[instrumental music]

15:07.107 --> 15:09.908
[indistinct chatter]

15:12.979 --> 15:16.147
Uh, mom, I think those people
are in our seats.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.416
Um..

15:18.418 --> 15:22.487
Excuse me. Uh, I believe
you're in our seats.

15:22.489 --> 15:26.057
No, uh, these are seats
11 and 12.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.425
Oh, here-here's the problem.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.460
Your seats
are in the meat section

15:29.462 --> 15:31.663
and this is
the vegetable section.

15:31.665 --> 15:33.097
You're all vegetables,
aren't you?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.165
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.734
We're all vegetables.

15:36.736 --> 15:41.172
Lady, I think you're mistaken.
We're potatoes.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.008
No. No, uh,
these are not potatoes.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.877
Uh, these are Cornish game hens.

15:47.013 --> 15:48.313
Wh-what are you
talking about?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.748
Look, here's the butter
and here's the chives.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.318
No. I'm sorry,
I think that's wild rice.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.720
Yes. Yes, it is.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.522
Oh, yeah, right.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.958
Come on, Sally, we're poultry.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.461
Sorry.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.900
I hope Brian's gonna be alright.

16:08.902 --> 16:11.502
- He'll be fine. He's a trooper.
- Yeah.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.506
Hello,
Jack Rabbit Delivery Service?

16:15.508 --> 16:18.343
Yeah, I'm looking at your ad
in the Yellow Pages.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.911
How would you feel
about delivering

16:19.913 --> 16:21.713
a tooth to an asparagus?

16:23.917 --> 16:26.050
Hello? Hello?

16:26.052 --> 16:27.852
[piano music]

16:27.854 --> 16:29.120
[applause]

16:29.122 --> 16:31.422
Yes. Yes, indeed.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.257
Let's hear it for
the two garlics!

16:33.259 --> 16:36.461
[applause]

16:39.165 --> 16:41.966
Now, we'll take a short break
while we air out the stage.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.868
[chuckles]

16:43.870 --> 16:46.704
Okay, guys, come on. Come on.
We follow the garlics.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.673
- It's gone!
- Wh-what's gone?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.608
My lucky tooth!
I can't go out there!

16:50.610 --> 16:53.244
Whoa, whoa. Uh, whoa,
what lucky tooth?

16:53.246 --> 16:55.613
The one that ALF
gave me for courage.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.448
Next on our entertainment menu

16:57.450 --> 17:00.351
a treat from our friends
in the vegetable family.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.654
I give you the Aspara-guys.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.491
Alright, Spencer,
I want you to go out there

17:06.493 --> 17:08.226
I want you to do those jokes.

17:08.228 --> 17:12.163
Oh, boy. My big break!

17:12.165 --> 17:15.166
Hey, Brian, I'm just,
I'm-I'm trying to understand

17:15.168 --> 17:16.768
about this tooth business.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.672
True story. A guy walks into
the principal's office

17:21.674 --> 17:23.107
with a duck on his head.

17:23.109 --> 17:26.411
The principal says,
"My gosh, how did this happen?"

17:26.413 --> 17:28.413
The duck says, "I don't know.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.616
It started as
a growth on my foot."

17:31.618 --> 17:35.586
- What's wrong?
- It wasn't funny.

17:35.588 --> 17:39.023
No, I mean where is Brian?
Why isn't he out there?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.793
What is this, an audience
or an oil painting?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.162
Hello?

17:44.164 --> 17:47.565
Uh, listen, I need a cab here,
as soon as possible.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.501
Yeah, uh, 167, Hemdale.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.671
It's an unassuming house
that needs a paint job.

17:53.673 --> 17:58.176
Uh-huh. Uh, you'll be going to
the Franklin Elementary School.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.546
How many passengers?
None, just a tooth.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.016
Hello? Hello?

18:05.018 --> 18:07.018
Excuse me, Mr. Tanner,
what seems to be the problem?

18:07.020 --> 18:10.888
- Uh, Brian's lost a tooth.
- Aw. How cute.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.323
But there's no business
like show business

18:12.325 --> 18:14.058
so let's go on with the show.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.327
Well, I'm afraid we'll need
another minute or so.

18:16.329 --> 18:19.630
Well, alright, but please hurry.
The radishes are getting testy.

18:22.535 --> 18:26.003
So, how many of you
are from out of town?

18:26.005 --> 18:30.374
Brian, no matter how special
Don Quixote's tooth may be

18:30.376 --> 18:33.144
you can't count on something
like that to give you courage.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.679
Why not?

18:34.681 --> 18:37.081
Because courage doesn't
come from some thing.

18:37.083 --> 18:41.185
Courage comes from inside.
From-from in you.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.989
If you can sing with a lucky
charm, you can sing without one.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.691
(Spencer)
'My teacher's so old'

18:46.693 --> 18:49.427
'her Social Security number's
in Roman numerals.'

18:49.429 --> 18:53.664
- But what if I mess up, dad?
- No. You won't mess up, son.

18:53.666 --> 18:57.201
And-and even if you do,
it doesn't matter.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.370
The important thing is
that you go out there

18:59.372 --> 19:01.873
and give it your best shot.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.942
Uh, uh, hello, Bye Bye Travel?

19:04.944 --> 19:08.713
Uh, yeah. Yeah, when's your
next flight to Hawaii?

19:08.715 --> 19:10.081
Oh, oh, perfect, good.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.817
Uh, listen,
on the way to the islands

19:12.819 --> 19:16.354
you think we could stop at
the Franklin Elementary School?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.256
Hello? Hello?

19:20.226 --> 19:23.027
May your daughters
marry substitute teachers!

19:25.298 --> 19:28.566
- But what about Spencer?
- What about me? I just bombed.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.867
The meat section hates me.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.170
Uh, they don't hate you,
Spencer.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.972
I think they just
don't understand comedy.

19:36.442 --> 19:39.277
Spencer, you're crying.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.678
No, I'm not.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.014
I was standing
too close to the onions.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.021
Look, I'm going to introduce
a vegetable out there.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.790
Now, is it going to be
green or red?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.692
Well, what's it gonna be, guys?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.127
I'm not going.

19:56.129 --> 19:57.228
You aren't?

19:57.230 --> 19:59.163
No, I'm scared.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.165
- You are?
- Yeah.

20:01.167 --> 20:05.069
I don't think I can even
remember the words to the song.

20:05.071 --> 20:06.771
Well, you say

20:06.773 --> 20:09.607
"Asparagus are long and green

20:09.609 --> 20:11.576
and good for you to eat."

20:11.578 --> 20:13.644
And I say

20:13.646 --> 20:16.547
"Will make your body
strong and lean

20:16.549 --> 20:18.983
our flavor can't be beat."

20:18.985 --> 20:20.318
Oh, yeah.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.453
Right, dad?

20:22.455 --> 20:23.921
Right.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.257
Think you better
introduce the Aspara-guys.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.660
Where are they?

20:29.662 --> 20:32.797
I don't know,
but I'm going back there.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.633
Okay, here we go.
Sit down, lady.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.538
And now, at long last,
the Aspara-guys.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.341
[applause]

20:46.579 --> 20:49.580

22:07.493 --> 22:09.327
Okay.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.329
Alright, Brian.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.597
Guess it's up to me.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.366
Yeah.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.402
...that was amazing.

22:18.404 --> 22:19.870
ALF?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.773
ALF! What are you
doing in that costume?

22:22.775 --> 22:26.143
Uh, uh, uh, my uncle died.

22:27.814 --> 22:30.147
ALF, I did it.
I sang my song!

22:30.149 --> 22:31.315
You did?

22:31.317 --> 22:33.384
- Without the lucky tooth.
- He was great.

22:33.386 --> 22:36.153
He was the best
vegetable up there.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.856
Yeah, you see, courage
doesn't come from a tooth

22:38.858 --> 22:40.358
it comes from in here.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.660
That's close enough.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.228
But thanks anyway.

22:45.998 --> 22:48.232
- Yeah. Come on, Brian.
- 'So cute.'

22:48.234 --> 22:50.868
Come on, let's get
ready for bed.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.273
Brian, we were great.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.144
I'm gonna make myself
a sandwich.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.446
Sitting with
all that food made me hungry.

23:02.448 --> 23:06.717
Well, uh, I'm glad
the kid did so well.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.019
I guess I'll go change.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.222
It's getting hot in here.

ALF..

23:14.260 --> 23:16.260
Yes?

23:18.297 --> 23:21.232
I don't think your uncle
really died, did he?

23:21.234 --> 23:23.367
Then who did we bury?

23:23.369 --> 23:25.102
I think that you were
gonna sneak out

23:25.104 --> 23:28.839
and, uh, bring Brian
that tooth, weren't you?

23:28.841 --> 23:30.674
I wasn't going to sneak.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.410
I was going to
hot wire a car.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.946
Whatever.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.716
You were very
concerned about Brian.

23:38.718 --> 23:42.953
I think...I think
that was very sweet.

23:42.955 --> 23:46.290
You, uh, you want
to hug me, don't you?

23:48.127 --> 23:51.462
Maybe we could start
with a handshake.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.063
Deal.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.434
[chuckles]

23:58.704 --> 24:00.137
I feel ridiculous.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.839
