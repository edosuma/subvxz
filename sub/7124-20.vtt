00:14.080 --> 00:20.224
Go to very distant lands

01:49.824 --> 01:50.336
Hey man

01:53.408 --> 01:54.432
Got my map

01:57.760 --> 02:00.320
So how's your week going

02:04.672 --> 02:05.440
So to speak

02:14.144 --> 02:14.656
So

02:14.912 --> 02:15.936
Are you ready to come home

02:16.448 --> 02:18.752
I think I'll just keep being a break for a while

02:22.080 --> 02:27.968
Ever since I was little I wanted to see

02:28.224 --> 02:30.272
The Shack is going to fall down

02:30.528 --> 02:31.296
Just look at it

02:31.808 --> 02:34.880
Play sandcastles in the sun baby

02:36.160 --> 02:37.440
You too young you wouldn't understand

02:38.208 --> 02:39.232
You're right

02:39.488 --> 02:40.256
I don't understand

02:40.512 --> 02:42.816
Look up to with your mystical Journey or whatever

02:43.328 --> 02:45.376
Only this walkie talkies we can stay in touch

02:45.632 --> 02:46.144
Just in case

02:47.424 --> 02:49.984
Oh man thanks don't stay in touch

02:51.008 --> 02:52.800
BMO was like really worried about you

02:54.080 --> 02:55.872
You tell a little goofball I said hi

02:57.408 --> 02:58.176
I will

02:59.200 --> 03:00.480
Well I guess I should head back

03:00.992 --> 03:02.016
Oh really

03:02.272 --> 03:03.040
So soon

03:03.552 --> 03:06.112
Yeah well here

03:06.624 --> 03:07.136
Sides

03:10.720 --> 03:11.488
Yeah

03:15.584 --> 03:17.632
Okay back to being a brick

03:23.008 --> 03:24.032
I'm so bored

03:35.808 --> 03:38.112
I'm starting to get a little Tippy my teacups

03:49.120 --> 03:55.264
Looks like our long your friend is on something

03:59.616 --> 04:03.200
Probably the result of its Tracy pooped out by a passing bird

04:04.736 --> 04:05.504
What's this

04:05.760 --> 04:08.320
Give me it's rattling in the bush in trouble

04:08.832 --> 04:10.368
Easter Bunny seems to think so

04:10.624 --> 04:13.696
Is sensitive Whispers quiver at the hint of eminent Danger

04:15.232 --> 04:18.047
Unfortunately for mr. bunny

04:18.303 --> 04:20.095
This is what nature is all about

04:21.630 --> 04:24.959
Beta male deer

04:25.215 --> 04:27.775
Not a threat to mr. bunny in the predatory sense

04:28.031 --> 04:29.823
But still above him in the food chain

04:30.079 --> 04:32.895
Mr. bunny wishing to avoid an encounter

04:33.151 --> 04:34.175
Hops away to safety

04:37.503 --> 04:39.039
Wild deers are jerks

04:39.551 --> 04:40.063
Hey man

04:40.319 --> 04:41.855
You know I can hear everything you say right

04:46.463 --> 04:49.023
Yeah but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie and I left it on

04:49.279 --> 04:50.047
You know that right

04:50.303 --> 04:51.071
Hi Jake

04:51.327 --> 04:52.351
Hi BMO

04:54.399 --> 04:55.167
No

04:56.447 --> 04:57.727
So what mr. buddy doing now

04:57.983 --> 04:59.263
It's not about the bunny

04:59.519 --> 05:01.311
The bunny is incidental to The Brick

05:01.567 --> 05:02.079
Experiment

05:03.103 --> 05:03.615
Sorry man

05:03.871 --> 05:04.639
Care about the funny

05:05.151 --> 05:06.175
Sorry man

05:06.431 --> 05:08.479
Look we love will leave you alone

05:11.551 --> 05:13.087
Are you still there

05:20.511 --> 05:23.071
Easter Bunny retreats to his Warren

05:23.583 --> 05:27.167
Consolation

05:27.935 --> 05:30.239
Twilight Zone the peaceful Forest

05:30.751 --> 05:33.823
Twilight unaware of the struggles that both soothes

05:34.079 --> 05:34.847
Unconcealed

05:35.615 --> 05:37.919
The Crickets begin to stir

05:38.431 --> 05:40.735
Rehearsing their musical Rhapsody

05:41.503 --> 05:47.135
In the distance flashes of heat lightning illuminated purple Summer Sky

05:47.903 --> 05:50.463
Even angry deer at last

05:50.719 --> 05:51.743
Must come to rest

05:52.767 --> 05:55.839
And so

05:56.351 --> 05:58.911
Quiz disappeared into a stand of trees

05:59.935 --> 06:00.447
Bratz

06:00.703 --> 06:03.007
The dream tomorrow's playlist battle

06:09.407 --> 06:15.551
Oh my God

06:15.807 --> 06:21.951
Storm

06:25.791 --> 06:31.935
If a definition of Bravery exists this must be it

06:39.871 --> 06:40.639
Sometimes

06:40.895 --> 06:41.919
How we have

06:49.599 --> 06:52.671
Easter Bunny has no friends

06:52.927 --> 06:55.487
No family no loved ones of any kind

06:55.999 --> 07:02.143
The wind is really picking up now small pain with gas

07:04.191 --> 07:05.727
Won't be long now

07:08.031 --> 07:14.175
Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help though I barely a friendly beaver

07:46.943 --> 07:47.967
Is a sea lard

07:48.479 --> 07:54.623
You expect to see if you must weather like this

08:05.631 --> 08:08.191
Looks like we got some pretty good evidence tonight

08:08.703 --> 08:11.775
Yes sir I sometimes those old sailors

08:12.287 --> 08:15.359
It's a Triumph of experience

08:15.615 --> 08:17.151
The academic

08:47.871 --> 08:50.687
In the Morning Light

08:50.943 --> 08:57.087
You signs remain of the summer storm that battered aside Billy Glenn the Beavers are finished with their working or heading home

08:59.135 --> 09:02.207
Sealord looks like she's going to wander the woods for a while

09:02.719 --> 09:06.303
Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean write a novel about her experiences

09:06.815 --> 09:09.631
Exhausted but can rest easy

09:09.887 --> 09:11.423
Knowing that it's home is secure

09:12.447 --> 09:13.215
But alas

09:13.727 --> 09:15.263
The bunnies rest is short-lived

09:16.031 --> 09:17.567
It appears that

09:19.615 --> 09:24.223
Crabs confused by the answer like appearance of mr. bunny protective damn situation

09:24.479 --> 09:26.783
Complaints on sure where this is going

10:07.743 --> 10:10.559
Manchester Sebastian on local level

10:11.583 --> 10:12.607
Words fail me

10:16.703 --> 10:17.471
Actually

10:24.383 --> 10:30.271
Is it confused

10:30.527 --> 10:36.671
Ladies and gentlemen
