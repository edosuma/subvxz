<i>NPD checkups to Metropolis
City Hall. 2078W in progress.</i>

00:55.020 --> 00:57.987
Kidnapping with advanced weapons.
Got to be Intergang.

00:57.989 --> 01:00.823
They took out half the reserve
with their tech weapons last week.

01:00.825 --> 01:02.991
Makes you nostalgic
for assault rifles.

01:31.256 --> 01:33.456
It's a lab they chose
to blast at, Maggie.

01:33.458 --> 01:37.159
These assholes are expecting something
to wreck, Dan. Probably with a cape.

01:37.161 --> 01:39.398
Lucky me,
I know a back way.

01:57.783 --> 01:59.548
Get Mr. Mayor and his
better half out of here

01:59.550 --> 02:01.817
before we get in trouble
from the man upstairs.

02:01.819 --> 02:04.120
Didn't know you
was a believer, boss.

02:04.122 --> 02:06.792
That ain't the man upstairs
I'm talking about.

02:13.799 --> 02:16.198
Step away from
the Mayor, Mannheim.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.801
Don't give me a reason.

02:17.803 --> 02:19.535
Then you shouldn't
have given me one.

02:23.841 --> 02:27.810
You, make sure they're dead.
Painfully sure.

02:27.812 --> 02:32.582
And you, grab our esteemed
Mayor while I call for a ride.

02:32.584 --> 02:34.887
Okay. I'll get you
out of here.

02:48.532 --> 02:52.468
Come on, fella. You don't
want to be a cop killer.

02:52.470 --> 02:53.903
Yeah, why's that?

03:00.978 --> 03:03.579
Huh?

03:03.581 --> 03:08.017
Hey, ever wonder what it feels
like to fall from a great distance?

03:08.019 --> 03:10.285
<i>Let's find out.</i>

03:10.287 --> 03:13.989
<i>Oh, looks like it hurts.</i>

03:13.991 --> 03:15.227
<i>Be right back.</i>

03:24.202 --> 03:27.136
Work, damn it!
Stupid piece of crap!

03:27.138 --> 03:29.873
You're supposed to transport
me on my command.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.341
<i>Don't bother. Fried
it with my heat vision.</i>

03:35.447 --> 03:38.047
Only place you're being
transported to, Mannheim,

03:38.049 --> 03:41.451
it's got three squares a day,
and lights out at 8:00.

03:41.453 --> 03:43.219
Son of a bitch!

03:46.024 --> 03:49.360
<i>You know, if there's one
thing I can't stand, it's a bully.</i>

04:03.574 --> 04:06.676
Guys like you
give Metropolis a bad name.

04:17.087 --> 04:19.321
But you should know
by now, Mannheim,

04:19.322 --> 04:22.227
no one tears my city apart
and gets away with it.

04:44.415 --> 04:48.951
I feel like I say this a couple of
times a week but thanks, Superman.

04:48.953 --> 04:50.653
I don't know what
we'd do without you.

04:50.655 --> 04:53.489
You sound like a guy who
wants my vote, Mr. Mayor.

04:53.491 --> 04:55.490
<i>Hey, hey.
That's my friend there.</i>

04:55.492 --> 05:01.297
Superman!
Hey, it's me, your old buddy.

05:01.299 --> 05:04.499
Bibbo Bibbowski. How is
the unluckiest sailor in town?

05:04.501 --> 05:08.304
Ah, come on. You ain't have to
save my bacon that many times!

05:08.306 --> 05:11.740
Anyway, ain't no sailor no more.
I'm a restaurateur.

05:11.742 --> 05:14.210
Ace O' Clubs Bar and Grill.

05:14.212 --> 05:15.981
How about a picture
for the joint?

05:18.350 --> 05:20.717
Yeah.

05:20.719 --> 05:23.453
Stupid thing. Never works
when you need it to.

05:23.455 --> 05:25.187
I got you covered.

05:25.189 --> 05:27.025
<i>Jimmy Olsen,
you're a lifesaver.</i>

05:28.258 --> 05:30.059
<i>Say Superman!</i>

05:30.061 --> 05:32.528
Superman!

05:32.530 --> 05:35.598
Thanks, big guy.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.667
I'll make sure to get
this to you, Mr. Bibbowski.

05:37.669 --> 05:41.073
See you down at the joint, kid.
The ribs are on me.

05:42.506 --> 05:45.307
Thanks, Jimmy. I really have
to get going.

05:45.309 --> 05:47.710
Leaguers, is anyone...

05:47.712 --> 05:51.013
- Available?
- 'Sup?

05:51.015 --> 05:54.316
I have to be somewhere. Think you
could help with the cleanup?

05:54.318 --> 05:56.319
Oh, again?

05:56.321 --> 05:59.788
I swear you guys think I'm some
sort of one-man janitorial crew.

05:59.790 --> 06:02.557
Well, while you're at it, my
apartment could use a going over.

06:02.559 --> 06:06.328
Whoa! What the hell
have you been up against?

06:06.330 --> 06:09.467
An Intergang crew that somehow
caught a hold of a mother box.

06:13.171 --> 06:17.607
<i>And that's not all. This
armor's from Apocalypse, too.</i>

06:17.609 --> 06:20.343
How'd you figure?

06:20.345 --> 06:22.677
I'm wearing the same stuff,
remember?

06:22.679 --> 06:25.814
Oh, great. Leftovers
from our war with Darkseid.

06:25.816 --> 06:28.818
We need to get this analyzed. Maybe
one of the others could help.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.453
No, we need someone
who's worked with this crap.

06:31.455 --> 06:33.689
Someone who knows it
inside and out.

06:33.691 --> 06:36.191
We need my dad.

06:36.193 --> 06:40.196
I could take it to him if you want.
I know you two don't exactly...

06:40.198 --> 06:44.833
Nah, it's cool. No problem ever
got better by avoiding it.

06:44.835 --> 06:47.170
Well, at least, I won't be
slowing you down on cleanup.

06:47.172 --> 06:49.308
- Later, partner.
- I owe you one, Flash.

06:50.607 --> 06:52.574
You owe me
about 30.

06:52.576 --> 06:55.146
I wonder if it's too late
to join the Titans.

06:56.614 --> 06:58.083
Is there an age limit?

07:04.121 --> 07:06.758
He's gonna take
pictures with anyone who asks.

07:08.626 --> 07:10.496
The guy just can't
help himself.

07:15.633 --> 07:17.667
You said
two minutes tops.

07:17.669 --> 07:19.768
Sorry, Miss Lane,
tech-enhanced gangsters

07:19.770 --> 07:22.672
kidnapping the Mayor and
other sort of distractions.

07:22.674 --> 07:24.372
I know. I saw it live.

07:24.374 --> 07:26.576
Are you sure you're not
just getting old?

07:26.578 --> 07:28.343
You'll have to tell me
what that's like.

07:28.345 --> 07:31.213
Ha! Super touche.

07:31.215 --> 07:34.516
<i>Your stories about Superman
helped me earn the people's trust.</i>

07:34.518 --> 07:37.220
Now it's time they learned
about the Kryptonian tech

07:37.222 --> 07:39.758
that brought the strange visitor
from another planet to Earth.

07:41.893 --> 07:45.294
And here's the compartment that
contained me as an infant.

07:45.296 --> 07:47.129
Throughout the trip, it was
in charge of monitoring

07:47.131 --> 07:50.299
my genetic makeup as well
as my basic metabolism.

07:50.301 --> 07:52.104
Not to mention
midnight feedings.

07:53.371 --> 07:55.304
How did it do all this?

07:55.306 --> 07:58.374
I've only gotten so far
studying Kryptonian technology.

07:58.376 --> 08:01.309
That's why I handed the job over to Dr.
Klyburn and her crew.

08:01.311 --> 08:03.545
Which we were more
than happy to take on.

08:03.547 --> 08:07.415
Only recently have we discovered these
super condensed ionized crystals.

08:07.417 --> 08:11.420
We believe they acted as hyperwave
acceleration units for transport.

08:11.422 --> 08:13.388
Oh, the gas.

08:13.390 --> 08:17.225
To put it simply. We pulled it
from the main section of the pod,

08:17.227 --> 08:19.828
the baby's car seat,
so to speak.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.398
<i>It can only be
activated one way.</i>

08:22.400 --> 08:24.503
You might want to look away
for a moment, Miss Lane.

08:26.203 --> 08:29.475
Kryptonian tech
can be a bit overwhelming.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.145
Holy...

08:36.346 --> 08:41.383
<i>Your identity genome
is confirmed, Kal-El.</i>

08:41.385 --> 08:44.853
<i>I am the physical embodiment of
a personally attuned program</i>

08:44.855 --> 08:49.492
<i>designed as a repository for all
that is Kryptonian in nature.</i>

08:49.494 --> 08:52.227
<i>My sole purpose on this
journey is to inform you,</i>

08:52.229 --> 08:56.399
<i>assist you and protect you
and all Kryptonian life.</i>

08:56.401 --> 08:58.300
- <i>During...</i>
- Wait a second. Is he...

08:58.302 --> 08:59.968
Yes, Miss Lane.

08:59.970 --> 09:02.872
You're looking at the last
son of Krypton's nanny.

09:02.874 --> 09:04.439
Keep watching.

09:04.441 --> 09:06.442
<i>...as I have
also been entrusted</i>

09:06.444 --> 09:09.911
<i>with preserving the history
of all Kryptonian bloodlines.</i>

09:09.913 --> 09:12.515
<i>We will begin with yours.</i>

09:12.517 --> 09:15.918
- <i>The House of El.</i>
- Wait, is that...

09:15.920 --> 09:17.987
There's your headline,
Miss Lane.

09:17.989 --> 09:21.527
I'll like you and the rest of
the world to meet my parents.

09:39.844 --> 09:41.876
So, what do you think?

09:41.878 --> 09:43.813
I don't know what
to say. It's...

09:43.815 --> 09:48.483
Hey, Superman,
looking good.

09:48.485 --> 09:52.921
It's gonna be a reminder
of just how alien you are.

09:52.923 --> 09:56.424
People forget that when you're
saving them from falling airplanes.

09:56.426 --> 09:58.861
True, yeah. I have faith that...

09:58.863 --> 10:00.465
<i>Have a good one, Superman!</i>

10:01.566 --> 10:03.567
Thanks. You do, too.

10:07.971 --> 10:09.639
There's a really
smart woman I know

10:09.641 --> 10:12.477
who always says daylight
is the best disinfectant.

10:13.510 --> 10:16.045
Lift back to <i>The Planet?</i>

10:16.047 --> 10:20.585
And save me from expensing cab fare
to Perry White. You are heroic.

10:22.820 --> 10:25.523
You know me,
always saving the day.

10:52.950 --> 10:56.319
Uh, thanks for the ride.
I gotta go.

10:56.321 --> 10:58.386
- There he is!
- Hey Superman, can I get a selfie?

10:58.388 --> 11:01.656
Me too.

11:01.658 --> 11:05.560
(CHUCKLES

11:05.562 --> 11:07.697
- You're in a rush.
- Got a big story.

11:07.699 --> 11:09.799
I don't want
to spoil your day

11:09.801 --> 11:12.334
but you're looking at the guy
with an exclusive on Intergang.

11:12.336 --> 11:14.739
Well, that's nice.
Come with me.

11:16.673 --> 11:19.474
What's
bigger than Intergang?

11:19.476 --> 11:21.544
You'll find out.

11:21.546 --> 11:25.381
No, right. You had that interview
with your super friend.

11:25.383 --> 11:26.652
I know what that means.

11:29.586 --> 11:30.989
In here.

11:42.032 --> 11:44.733
You're always on fire
after seeing him.

11:44.735 --> 11:46.702
Should I be jealous?

11:46.704 --> 11:48.737
I think it's the tights.

11:48.739 --> 11:51.741
I can pick up a pair
if that's all it takes.

11:51.743 --> 11:55.844
Perfect. Wear 'em on our trip
to the Hamptons this weekend.

11:55.846 --> 11:57.848
Uh, about that...

11:59.149 --> 12:02.852
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

12:02.854 --> 12:05.588
Do you know how hard
it is for me to get away?

12:05.590 --> 12:07.857
I gave up that interview
with the Secretary of State!

12:07.859 --> 12:10.025
- I can explain.
- Really?

12:10.027 --> 12:12.026
You mean it's not
some secret meeting

12:12.028 --> 12:14.663
with some secret spies
in some secret location?

12:14.665 --> 12:15.967
My parents are in town.

12:17.534 --> 12:22.003
Serious? So,
you buried the lede?

12:22.005 --> 12:25.473
This weekend just got
a whole lot more interesting.

12:25.475 --> 12:28.810
Um... I don't...

12:28.812 --> 12:30.045
You don't what?

12:30.047 --> 12:31.881
Want me to meet them?

12:31.883 --> 12:33.352
Don't you think it's time?

12:36.921 --> 12:39.688
Lois, wait.
It's just that...

12:39.690 --> 12:41.756
Look, Clark, I'm not
gonna waste time

12:41.758 --> 12:45.428
worrying if a guy likes me or not.
We're both adults.

12:45.430 --> 12:50.568
I know it was my idea to keep things secret
at work, but I'm really trying here.

12:51.599 --> 12:54.969
No. No, you're right.
You should meet them.

12:54.971 --> 12:57.473
It's just that this is
uncharted territory for me

12:57.475 --> 13:00.111
and there's some things
I need to get used to sharing.

13:01.611 --> 13:03.414
Clark, it's your parents.

13:04.114 --> 13:06.147
What am I gonna find out?

13:06.149 --> 13:07.718
That you were a huge dork?

13:09.152 --> 13:10.555
I already know that.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.503
It'll be fine. Just fine.

13:31.575 --> 13:33.912
Well, Dr. Stone,
what's the verdict?

13:37.013 --> 13:41.851
It matches what we've seen from other
Apocalyptian tech but not completely.

13:41.853 --> 13:44.053
John, can you come
here for a moment?

13:44.055 --> 13:46.090
I can't remember the last
time you asked for help.

13:47.859 --> 13:50.961
Dr. Irons is one of S.T.A.R.
Labs premier engineers.

13:53.029 --> 13:56.768
If it's about this metal,
Silas, I've been... Oh.

13:58.536 --> 14:00.902
That's him.

14:00.904 --> 14:03.738
- Have we met?
- At a construction site, once.

14:03.740 --> 14:07.675
I had just quite LexCorp and
wanted to get my mind off it.

14:07.677 --> 14:10.578
I remember. Nice shirt.

14:10.580 --> 14:12.714
I wear it with pride.

14:12.716 --> 14:15.083
Oh, can we just
do this already?

14:15.085 --> 14:16.618
What'd you find, John?

14:16.620 --> 14:20.588
It's definitely
from Apocalypse.

14:20.590 --> 14:26.127
But it's been bonded with Earth-based
tri-formulite at an atomic level.

14:26.129 --> 14:27.999
The combination
makes this stronger.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.567
Incredible!

14:31.569 --> 14:34.169
That means it's even
stronger than you, Victor.

14:34.171 --> 14:37.238
Always got an encouraging
word, huh, Dad?

14:37.240 --> 14:41.175
You'll need some very sophisticated
resources to produce an alloy like this.

14:41.177 --> 14:44.313
The S.T.A.R. Labs could do it, but
it sure didn't come from here.

14:44.315 --> 14:47.116
Maybe Wayne Tech. Or even...

14:47.118 --> 14:50.989
Of course. Cyborg,
we'll catch up later.

14:53.557 --> 14:56.592
Thank you both for
your time and expertise.

14:56.594 --> 14:58.162
Your welcome, Superman.

15:03.734 --> 15:07.303
I appreciate you bringing
me in on this, son.

15:07.305 --> 15:09.905
It's been a long time.

15:09.907 --> 15:12.676
Yeah, I know.
Sorry about that.

15:15.345 --> 15:17.114
<i>Dr. Irons, you good?</i>

15:18.215 --> 15:19.884
Better than ever, Victor.

15:35.166 --> 15:36.667
Lose something, Lex?

15:39.836 --> 15:44.272
I'm sorry. What are we blaming
me for now, Superman?

15:44.274 --> 15:47.041
Those weapons
this morning.

15:47.043 --> 15:48.743
They're based
on alien technology,

15:48.745 --> 15:51.613
but clearly modified
for Intergang here on Earth.

15:51.615 --> 15:53.948
Ooh, that sounds scary.

15:53.950 --> 15:58.853
But as you can see, I spend my days under
house arrest, wearing this crude leash.

15:58.855 --> 16:01.325
I've added a little dash
of Kryptonite green.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.162
Don't worry, it's not real.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.397
Oh, come on.

16:09.399 --> 16:14.002
Intergang has connections all over
the planet. It could be anyone.

16:14.004 --> 16:16.671
We'll get to
the bottom of it, Lex.

16:16.673 --> 16:20.208
And when we do, I'll be back.

16:20.210 --> 16:23.212
You know something
I don't know?

16:23.214 --> 16:27.686
Only that this city's never going
to love you just for hating me.

16:38.162 --> 16:42.030
But Senator, the rents on
those slums were raised 200%.

16:42.032 --> 16:44.867
As the newly disclosed owner, you
must have some kind of a comment.

16:47.303 --> 16:50.674
- I guess not.
- <i>Incoming.</i>

16:52.308 --> 16:55.410
I heard something juicy
and I had to share.

16:55.412 --> 16:58.380
Doesn't <i>Daily Planet Live</i>
go on the air in two minutes?

16:58.382 --> 17:00.952
Mmm-mmm. I'm not on
until the second segment.

17:02.686 --> 17:04.089
I'm sure it could wait.

17:06.857 --> 17:09.892
So you're meeting
the parents?

17:09.894 --> 17:12.126
Oh, God, make it stop.

17:12.127 --> 17:14.797
Lois, you're great.
I respect you.

17:14.799 --> 17:17.098
I wanted to be you until
I found out on camera

17:17.099 --> 17:19.032
there's more than digging
through government garbage.

17:19.035 --> 17:24.071
- Who told you anyway?
- You did, just now.

17:24.074 --> 17:28.278
I had a suspicion something was up when
you stopped calling him "Smallville."

17:29.980 --> 17:32.146
I did?

17:32.148 --> 17:34.482
Sweetie, the women here notice
everything about tall, handsome men.

17:34.484 --> 17:37.152
And the only competition in
this place is Steve Lombard,

17:37.154 --> 17:40.088
and he makes me feel
like I need to shower.

17:40.090 --> 17:43.325
Hello ladies, did someone
mention the Stevenator?

17:43.327 --> 17:46.228
Yes, I think it was
human resources.

17:46.230 --> 17:47.732
You see my point?

17:50.067 --> 17:52.033
Hey!

17:52.035 --> 17:54.736
Listen, Cat, Clark and I are
just good friends right now.

17:54.738 --> 17:57.306
You wanna spread it around
the office? Have at it.

17:57.308 --> 17:59.411
- Just let me get back to work, okay?
- Okay, okay.

18:00.377 --> 18:02.877
Just be careful.

18:02.879 --> 18:05.379
You always said Clark seemed different
like he's got a wall around him.

18:05.381 --> 18:09.019
<i>It's like he doesn't want anyone to
get too close, you know what I mean?</i>

18:10.221 --> 18:12.754
Yeah, I guess I do.

18:12.756 --> 18:14.356
<i>We need you
on set, Miss Grant.</i>

18:14.358 --> 18:16.194
That's my cue. See ya.

18:48.559 --> 18:50.091
Dropped something?

18:50.093 --> 18:52.261
As your long-suffering,
devoted wife,

18:52.263 --> 18:54.296
I'm used to your butter
fingers at home

18:54.298 --> 18:57.532
but, Hank, you're setting
a bad example for the others.

18:57.534 --> 18:59.334
Yeah, Commander,
I'm starting to wonder

18:59.336 --> 19:01.569
if we got the wrong
Henshaw in charge.

19:01.571 --> 19:03.905
Guys, I'm happy to let
Terri call the shots,

19:03.907 --> 19:06.207
but I got to warn you, I'm
considered the nice Henshaw.

19:06.209 --> 19:08.076
Yeah, right.

19:08.078 --> 19:10.145
Terri, give Houston a call.

19:10.147 --> 19:12.548
Looks like they were right
about the hydraulic struts.

19:12.550 --> 19:15.216
The launch vibration probably
knocked some screws loose.

19:15.218 --> 19:17.418
Knocked some screws
loose. Very technical.

19:17.420 --> 19:22.156
Well, I'm sure you can science
that up a bit, Madam Engineer.

19:22.158 --> 19:26.228
Houston, this is <i>Excalibur.</i>
Come in, Houston.

19:26.230 --> 19:28.396
Come on,
Space Rangers.

19:28.398 --> 19:31.066
Last looks before
we head back in.

19:31.068 --> 19:35.404
It's your ninth trip up here, boss.
You can't still be dazzled.

19:35.406 --> 19:37.505
I'm just looking
for a red cape.

19:37.507 --> 19:40.375
You can see it
if he's above the exosphere.

19:40.377 --> 19:43.248
He's been up here twice, you know.
Saved my ass one time.

19:46.449 --> 19:48.852
<i>Yes, sir. You can
always count on Superman.</i>

20:15.879 --> 20:18.113
I hate to
interrupt your plans.

20:18.115 --> 20:20.251
How was your night
in the town, Mr. Luthor?

20:24.388 --> 20:26.288
Phenomenal, Gregory.

20:26.290 --> 20:29.023
But then again, every private
performance by the Bolshoi

20:29.025 --> 20:31.292
is a little better
when it's forbidden.

20:31.294 --> 20:33.462
Do you have something for me?

20:33.464 --> 20:36.498
Uh...
Right.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.604
Sometimes I forget which one of us the
government's placed under house arrest.

20:41.906 --> 20:43.107
I don't.

20:48.177 --> 20:51.515
Hank? They need you
back online. Important.

20:53.183 --> 20:54.586
Henshaw here. What's up?

20:56.419 --> 20:58.252
Oh, hell!

20:58.254 --> 21:00.254
We've got unidentified
debris heading our way.

21:00.256 --> 21:02.226
Everyone, back
to the ship. Now!

21:04.194 --> 21:05.363
Leave it!

21:15.272 --> 21:18.542
Always happy to walk among the
greatest minds of this generation.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.411
That's why I bought them.

21:22.413 --> 21:25.480
That specimen's clearly
porphyritic rock.

21:25.482 --> 21:27.452
Read a book, you clod.

21:29.586 --> 21:33.124
At last, someone understands
Euclid's fifth postulate.

21:34.090 --> 21:35.627
Too bad it's not you.

21:39.429 --> 21:41.599
I do not suffer fools, people.

21:43.199 --> 21:45.533
The world is filled
with too many already,

21:45.535 --> 21:49.037
obsequious cretans
who worship aliens,

21:49.039 --> 21:52.240
believing them to be
the agents of justice.

21:52.242 --> 21:57.011
But I have seen the alien's true face.
I understand his threat.

21:57.013 --> 22:00.248
In spite of false conviction at
the hands of these vigilantes,

22:00.250 --> 22:04.019
LexCorp has stayed on mission,
redoubling its efforts

22:04.021 --> 22:06.253
to find the next
alien Ubermensch

22:06.255 --> 22:08.559
and crush it
in its infancy.

22:10.426 --> 22:13.531
- Now, show me what you've found.
- Okay.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.100
They hacked into Houston's
encrypted feed

22:19.102 --> 22:22.037
from the <i>Excalibur</i> shuttle, and
something's heading our way.

22:27.311 --> 22:31.413
<i>We've got 30 seconds.
You need to fire engines now!</i>

22:31.415 --> 22:35.349
I'd like to see what they're running
away from. We have a satellite nearby?

22:40.791 --> 22:42.126
Enlarge.

22:46.397 --> 22:49.463
Does that asteroid look
unusual to you?

22:49.465 --> 22:52.436
- It looks lumpy.
- Hmm.

22:54.038 --> 22:55.673
I was going
to say pregnant.

23:02.745 --> 23:05.414
Tether's still attached,
Bay door's open. 12 degrees.

23:05.416 --> 23:08.152
I don't care. Initiate
primary thrusters now!

23:12.121 --> 23:15.257
<i>Captain, impact! We're breaking up!</i>

23:15.259 --> 23:17.325
We lost starboard
thrusters and...

23:17.327 --> 23:19.293
Oh, my God, Hank,
we're not gonna make it.

23:19.295 --> 23:20.828
- What do you say, Captain?
- Like hell, we're not!

23:20.830 --> 23:23.568
Superman will save us,
just like always.

23:29.173 --> 23:31.042
We're breaking up!

23:33.744 --> 23:37.846
Stay calm, everyone.
He's on his way. I know it.

23:37.848 --> 23:39.748
- ...lose some thrusters. Out of control...
- Hey, what are you...

23:39.750 --> 23:42.553
It's okay, Terri. You can
always count on Superman.

23:47.657 --> 23:50.061
Terri, no!

23:54.598 --> 23:57.201
Superman, I knew
you'd come.

24:32.703 --> 24:35.870
<i>Mr. Luthor? I have to
hurry before I'm missed.</i>

24:35.872 --> 24:38.240
<i>The meteorite's landed
in the mid-Atlantic channel,</i>

24:38.242 --> 24:42.644
<i>coordinates 4712 North,
74595 West.</i>

24:42.646 --> 24:44.646
<i>Did you get that?</i>

24:44.648 --> 24:47.281
You son's anti-toxin will
be delivered within the hour.

24:47.283 --> 24:50.088
Congratulations on his survival.

24:51.588 --> 24:53.391
Time to go for a swim.

25:02.799 --> 25:04.432
Clark, flank me!

25:12.676 --> 25:16.211
Seriously, Diana. We need to
use code names in the field.

25:16.213 --> 25:18.413
You just called me Diana.

25:18.415 --> 25:19.684
But that's what you
want to be called.

25:22.753 --> 25:24.953
You want to be called Superman?

25:27.623 --> 25:30.192
Sounds like even your ego
is super strong.

25:30.194 --> 25:32.426
I just don't need
my real name public.

25:32.428 --> 25:33.430
Besides...

25:36.199 --> 25:37.432
I like Superman.

25:42.606 --> 25:45.473
Because Wonder Man sounds
like we're married?

25:45.475 --> 25:48.545
No. Because
she gave it to me.

25:57.521 --> 25:58.886
You mean Lois?

25:58.888 --> 26:00.524
Yeah, Lois.

26:03.894 --> 26:08.666
Funny how you use her actual name,
but don't allow her to know yours.

26:11.467 --> 26:12.869
It's a complicated
relationship.

26:14.271 --> 26:15.740
Kind of like ours was.

26:17.373 --> 26:18.708
It was nice for a while.

26:19.775 --> 26:21.211
Yes, it was.

26:22.713 --> 26:24.745
It's just as well.

26:24.747 --> 26:27.581
I wasn't very good at playing
this masquerade of yours.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.350
Towel?

26:29.352 --> 26:31.453
I don't sweat.

26:31.455 --> 26:33.323
Maybe not on the outside.

26:36.392 --> 26:38.460
<i>Guys, Lennon
finally made it.</i>

26:38.462 --> 26:39.597
<i>We're all in
the meeting room.</i>

26:44.900 --> 26:47.537
<i>Descending
down, past 9,000 meters.</i>

26:50.706 --> 26:56.877
2,500 meters. I hear something
off the port side.

26:56.879 --> 26:59.681
I'm paying you for
your experience, Hazelwood.

26:59.683 --> 27:01.816
Be skittish on
your own time.

27:01.818 --> 27:04.752
<i>We're already at
10,000 meters, Mr. Luthor.</i>

27:04.754 --> 27:08.225
Dive deeper. I wanna
find that meteorite.

27:25.475 --> 27:28.579
Uh, Mr. Luthor,
there's someone out there.

27:35.918 --> 27:40.488
Those are Atlanteans,
you idiot. Aquaman's tribe.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.793
Hold on, Lex.
I'm picking up something.

28:01.043 --> 28:04.445
I suppose you want us to find
out where that's coming from.

28:04.447 --> 28:06.383
<i>You suppose correctly.</i>

28:21.031 --> 28:22.433
<i>They stopped.</i>

28:35.478 --> 28:38.379
<i>Something just grabbed them!
I can't get a visual.</i>

28:38.381 --> 28:42.450
<i>It sounds like they're being torn apart.</i>

28:42.452 --> 28:44.422
<i>Mr. Luthor,
are you still there?</i>

28:46.723 --> 28:49.960
We've gotta get out of here!
We gotta... We gotta...

28:54.531 --> 28:56.498
What the hell?

29:33.602 --> 29:34.738
He's gone.

29:36.039 --> 29:38.809
Go back. I want
to see that thing again.

29:42.745 --> 29:45.946
<i>Amazing. A creature
who's traveled light years</i>

29:45.948 --> 29:49.617
<i>through space and survived
a catastrophic entry to Earth.</i>

29:49.619 --> 29:52.523
The Blue Boy Scout could
have some competition.

29:58.128 --> 30:02.896
Okay, next up, the operating budget
for the upcoming fiscal year.

30:02.898 --> 30:06.701
Utilities are above what the
UN cleared for funding, guys.

30:06.703 --> 30:09.103
I'll handle it.
Move on, Cyborg.

30:09.105 --> 30:12.139
Wonder Woman merchandise
did very well this year.

30:12.141 --> 30:14.911
I can step up when the Wayne
Foundation falls short.

30:16.111 --> 30:18.213
You're kidding, right?

30:18.215 --> 30:21.883
Okay, okay. Let's just agree we
have this covered. What else?

30:21.885 --> 30:23.952
Just the <i>Excalibur</i> incident.

30:23.954 --> 30:25.720
Only three bodies recovered.

30:25.722 --> 30:28.223
I've got my guards
investigating the impact area.

30:28.225 --> 30:30.191
S.T.A.R. Labs wanted
some rock samples.

30:30.193 --> 30:33.126
All right. Well, if that's it,
we'll meet next Thursday.

30:33.128 --> 30:35.663
Same Bat time,
same Bat channel.

30:35.665 --> 30:37.932
- I won't be here.
- Why?

30:37.934 --> 30:40.100
Yeah, if I can be here,
you can be here.

30:40.102 --> 30:42.669
Dude, it takes you all of three
seconds to get here and back.

30:42.671 --> 30:45.540
Two at most,
but point taken.

30:45.542 --> 30:49.277
I have a meeting with the headmaster
at Damian's boarding school.

30:49.279 --> 30:54.182
No way! Batman has a
parent-teacher conference? That's great.

30:54.184 --> 30:59.153
Are you in the PTA too?
Tell me you're in the PTA.

30:59.155 --> 31:01.088
I'm Batman.

31:01.090 --> 31:03.124
We need more chaperones
for homecoming.

31:03.126 --> 31:05.559
Who has to be
convinced to sign up?

31:11.167 --> 31:14.605
I'm just joking.
I think that's great.

31:16.238 --> 31:17.807
Is he still
glaring at me?

31:18.942 --> 31:20.942
Hmm.

31:20.944 --> 31:22.876
We could've just pushed the
meeting back to that evening.

31:22.878 --> 31:26.116
Ah, can't. I've got
rehearsal dinner that night.

31:27.250 --> 31:29.317
Is he in a play?

31:29.319 --> 31:32.787
He's getting married. Somehow.

31:32.789 --> 31:34.289
Yup, married the next day.

31:34.291 --> 31:38.760
Limos, banquet hall, DJ,
the whole shebang.

31:38.762 --> 31:40.498
Just the immediate family,
you understand?

31:41.130 --> 31:43.030
Does Iris know?

31:43.032 --> 31:44.568
She better,
she picked the date.

31:45.599 --> 31:49.002
No, I mean, does
she know about you?

31:49.004 --> 31:51.138
Are you kidding?
I told her ages ago.

31:51.140 --> 31:53.944
Oh, geez, Supes. You can't drop a
bomb like that on a honeymoon.

31:55.811 --> 31:58.178
- Aren't you worried?
- About what?

31:58.180 --> 32:00.114
About bringing her
into your world?

32:00.116 --> 32:02.286
The dangers, the sacrifice...

32:04.087 --> 32:06.557
Clark, that's what
marriage is all about.

32:12.028 --> 32:15.262
This calls for a toast. We've
got some beer in the fridge.

32:15.264 --> 32:18.031
I know. Milk for you.

32:18.033 --> 32:22.369
Congratulations. Where you going?
Fiji, Bora Bora, SeaWorld?

32:22.371 --> 32:25.208
<i>Okay, Flash, there
are times when speed is not good.</i>

32:32.381 --> 32:35.817
<i>So, next thing I know,
he's climbed on top of that bull.</i>

32:35.819 --> 32:38.051
It couldn't throw off
my little Clark though.

32:38.053 --> 32:40.053
The kid was
a daredevil.

32:40.055 --> 32:42.889
This Clark? The guy
who irons his socks?

32:42.891 --> 32:44.992
Dad, come on! TMI.

32:44.994 --> 32:47.928
- What's that mean?
- Too much information, Jonathan.

32:47.930 --> 32:50.897
I'm sure Lois has heard
half these stories before.

32:50.899 --> 32:52.136
Not really.

32:53.003 --> 32:55.837
Not at all.

32:55.839 --> 32:58.740
That's because if my folks
have taught me one thing,

32:58.742 --> 33:00.674
it's not to talk
about myself.

33:00.676 --> 33:03.043
That's a parent's job.

33:03.045 --> 33:06.583
Mission accomplished. Sounds
like there's a lot I don't know.

33:07.884 --> 33:10.217
Warn me now, if I should
keep my distance.

33:10.219 --> 33:14.021
Well, you wouldn't be the first
young lady to break his heart.

33:14.023 --> 33:16.156
TMI, Ma!

33:16.158 --> 33:18.792
Oh, now, we're getting
to the good stuff.

33:18.794 --> 33:23.731
Well, first there was Lana,
lovely girl, lived next door.

33:23.733 --> 33:26.867
She'll come over once in a while, not...
Not like Pete Ross.

33:26.869 --> 33:29.136
I mean, he was
there every day.

33:29.138 --> 33:31.705
I always wondered
about that boy.

33:31.707 --> 33:36.277
Well, then there was the girl on the
swim team. Laurel, Laura... Um...

33:36.279 --> 33:38.812
Lori. Lori Lemaris.

33:38.814 --> 33:43.017
I remember her. She was quite a catch.

33:43.019 --> 33:45.386
- Pa!
- Clark's right.

33:45.388 --> 33:49.057
Maybe we shouldn't talk about her.
I am serving halibut.

33:54.930 --> 33:58.232
Come on. Taxi!

33:58.234 --> 34:01.071
Here it comes.
And there it goes.

34:02.805 --> 34:04.438
You okay?

34:04.440 --> 34:07.075
You couldn't wait to get me
out of there, could you?

34:07.077 --> 34:10.078
Well, that's not true. I didn't want
you to be bored by all those stories.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.145
Bored? Clark,
this is the first time

34:12.147 --> 34:14.815
I think I've ever learned
anything about you.

34:14.817 --> 34:17.851
To be honest, it drove home how
much distance you keep between us.

34:17.853 --> 34:20.290
Lois, you know me
better than anyone.

34:21.458 --> 34:23.724
Then that's a real shame.

34:23.726 --> 34:25.992
Nothing is more important
to me than you.

34:25.994 --> 34:27.397
I just have trouble
showing it.

34:29.398 --> 34:32.032
There's something else
going on, and sometimes

34:32.034 --> 34:34.437
I feel like it scares you
that I might get to the truth.

34:36.505 --> 34:37.808
Taxi!

34:43.212 --> 34:46.114
On second thought,
I think I'm gonna walk.

35:35.230 --> 35:37.831
I think I'm at the spot
where the killer emerged.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.933
I don't see
any sign of him.

35:39.935 --> 35:42.136
<i>I need to get
back to the others.</i>

35:42.138 --> 35:44.842
I've got the coordinates.
I'll let everyone know.

35:45.909 --> 35:47.311
Sorry for your loss, man.

35:57.554 --> 35:59.253
I'm sorry.

35:59.255 --> 36:02.023
I guess we talked too
much tonight, didn't we?

36:02.025 --> 36:04.425
You were fine, Ma.

36:04.427 --> 36:07.561
We're getting old.
The secrets, uh...

36:07.563 --> 36:10.134
They don't seem as
important as they used to.

36:11.366 --> 36:15.869
They served a purpose.
Still do.

36:15.871 --> 36:20.340
She's a nice girl, Clark.
You deserve someone special.

36:20.342 --> 36:26.179
The problem is, the more special they
are, the more you want to protect them.

36:26.181 --> 36:31.117
I know. But you should have
choices like anyone else.

36:31.119 --> 36:34.922
We raised you so that
you could be yourself.

36:34.924 --> 36:37.194
We didn't raise you
to be alone, honey.

36:39.362 --> 36:41.295
I've never been alone.

36:41.297 --> 36:43.467
Not since the day
you and Pa took me in.

37:39.956 --> 37:41.024
Brian?

38:05.281 --> 38:06.483
Cat, please.

38:08.217 --> 38:10.016
At least, let me
have my coffee first.

38:10.018 --> 38:12.154
Abracadabra. Here,
caffeine, ingest and go.

38:14.089 --> 38:15.292
There's nothing to say.

38:16.259 --> 38:19.025
That's never true.

38:19.027 --> 38:21.996
Isn't there a Wayne or a
Kardashian you could be chasing?

38:21.998 --> 38:24.197
You can't.
The Kansas crew.

38:24.199 --> 38:26.567
Was he all nervous
and shaky like he gets?

38:26.569 --> 38:28.703
I gotta start
taking the stairs.

38:28.705 --> 38:31.739
Well, you know, he got here early.

38:31.741 --> 38:33.474
- Clark?
- Yup.

38:33.476 --> 38:36.076
And he keeps finding
reasons to walk by your desk.

38:36.078 --> 38:37.744
Cat, seriously,
can you lay off?

38:37.746 --> 38:40.982
Things didn't go
quite as expected.

38:40.984 --> 38:43.217
Having you press buttons is
really not helping anything.

38:43.219 --> 38:44.751
Lois!

38:44.753 --> 38:46.290
I stopped and got
you some...

38:47.456 --> 38:48.592
Coffee.

38:51.761 --> 38:53.594
Should I leave?

38:53.596 --> 38:56.262
No, Cat. I was just looking
for a background

38:56.264 --> 38:59.166
on a Congressman
Lois interviewed last year.

38:59.168 --> 39:02.469
Maybe we can meet for lunch.
We need to talk.

39:02.471 --> 39:05.306
Okay. I can eat
around 2:00 p.m.

39:11.781 --> 39:14.280
That'll be great. Whatever
works for you, works for me.

39:14.282 --> 39:15.985
There's a place
in Hob's Bay.

39:18.054 --> 39:20.590
Get the address from Jimmy
and I'll meet you there.

39:23.692 --> 39:26.059
Wow!

39:26.061 --> 39:28.128
- So, what do you think?
- It's hard to say.

39:28.130 --> 39:31.498
He's nervous, that's for sure.
It could be nothing.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.103
You know how men
are, you never know.

39:35.571 --> 39:38.605
Hmm. Yeah,
you're in trouble.

39:38.607 --> 39:41.175
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

39:41.177 --> 39:44.612
<i>Don't order a lot for lunch. You
don't wanna be bloated when, mmm...</i>

39:44.614 --> 39:47.380
I got the alert. What's up?

39:47.382 --> 39:50.250
Just wanted you to
know there's action in your zone.

39:50.252 --> 39:52.619
- <i>Where?</i>
- I think we're okay for now.

39:52.621 --> 39:54.822
Flash and a few others
are already headed out.

39:54.824 --> 39:57.491
Initial reports are some
kind of creature.

39:57.493 --> 40:00.360
Arthur spotted something
off shore, might be related.

40:00.362 --> 40:02.663
I've got a lunch
with Lois but I'll cancel.

40:02.665 --> 40:05.266
We're good with who we have.

40:05.268 --> 40:08.701
This lunch wouldn't have anything to do
with what we were discussing the other day?

40:08.703 --> 40:11.172
Call if the League
needs me.

40:11.174 --> 40:14.143
Is that your way of saying,
"Mind your own business?"

40:14.643 --> 40:15.779
Yup.

41:07.763 --> 41:12.435
It killed him. It killed him!

41:23.813 --> 41:26.246
Oh, my God!
Goodness!

41:26.248 --> 41:29.315
If anyone's watching this,
send help.

41:29.317 --> 41:31.420
This monster's
killing everyone!

41:34.857 --> 41:36.759
Oh, no!

41:37.692 --> 41:38.828
No!

41:57.480 --> 41:59.846
It's okay, kid.
We're here now.

41:59.848 --> 42:01.884
Flash, civilians!

42:27.243 --> 42:28.608
Hawk's still alive.

42:28.610 --> 42:30.244
<i>Lantern?
We need a parameter.</i>

42:30.246 --> 42:32.478
Like hell! This is no time
for a rope-a-dope.

42:32.480 --> 42:35.248
I'm a member of
the Green Lantern Corp.

42:35.250 --> 42:38.652
We eat monsters
like this for breakfast.

43:08.583 --> 43:11.018
Okay, I didn't see
that coming.

44:17.453 --> 44:21.424
Alert. Three leaders down and we
only just got here. Need backup now.

44:33.469 --> 44:37.938
Dabney Donovan, how's my
hard-earned money being spent?

44:37.940 --> 44:41.945
Lex, why it's all in front of you.
Every penny.

44:43.746 --> 44:47.780
I'll stay here. I don't
do crazy very well.

44:47.782 --> 44:50.483
- Still carrying the gun?
- Oh yes.

44:50.485 --> 44:53.721
You never know when one of
my babies might break out.

44:53.723 --> 44:56.558
They get confused.

44:57.759 --> 45:00.561
Any progress?

45:00.563 --> 45:05.632
Hit or miss, I expect to have more
obedient samples soon. Very soon.

45:05.634 --> 45:09.103
I don't want samples.
I want an army.

45:09.105 --> 45:11.704
It's difficult
replicating DNA.

45:11.706 --> 45:14.775
We need a more
durable code.

45:14.777 --> 45:17.578
Now, that creature
you told me about...

45:17.580 --> 45:20.683
We're tracking it down, Dabney.
Don't count your chickens.

45:22.016 --> 45:23.449
What about this one?

45:23.451 --> 45:25.918
This was to be the prototype.

45:25.920 --> 45:28.692
- It's still growing.
- Lex!

45:29.958 --> 45:31.027
We found it.

45:53.449 --> 45:54.784
Fall, you bastard!

46:07.462 --> 46:09.529
<i>And then I says
to Superman, I says,</i>

46:09.531 --> 46:13.500
"Hit him with an uppercut. Now
counterpunch, counterpunch!"

46:13.502 --> 46:16.072
And that's pretty much how I helped
him save the city, more or less.

46:17.473 --> 46:19.206
That's quite a story.

46:19.208 --> 46:22.175
- I got a hundred of 'em.
- I'll bet you do.

46:22.177 --> 46:24.511
How about menus,
do you have any of those?

46:24.513 --> 46:26.913
Oh yeah. Here you go.

46:26.915 --> 46:32.121
Try the ribs. It comes with super
sauce and a side of super slaw.

46:32.922 --> 46:34.424
Um, super!

46:37.592 --> 46:39.860
I'm sorry. Jimmy
loves this place.

46:39.862 --> 46:43.463
Jimmy Olsen eats
chili dogs for breakfast.

46:43.465 --> 46:46.168
So, what did you
wanna talk about?

46:47.036 --> 46:48.969
Okay.

46:48.971 --> 46:51.838
The other day you said it
felt like I was holding back,

46:51.840 --> 46:53.176
like something was wrong.

46:54.243 --> 46:56.108
You were right.

46:56.110 --> 46:58.811
Okay. Glad to know
I'm not crazy.

46:58.813 --> 47:01.047
Well, this doesn't have
to be a bad break-up.

47:01.049 --> 47:02.916
I'm still gonna come
to work each day.

47:02.918 --> 47:04.717
If that's a problem,
it's on you to deal with. I...

47:04.719 --> 47:07.820
Wait, let me finish.

47:07.822 --> 47:09.625
There's a reason
why I'm so secretive.

47:11.927 --> 47:13.830
And I think you deserve
to know why.

47:14.897 --> 47:15.998
And?

47:18.266 --> 47:19.802
I'm Superman.

47:24.772 --> 47:27.843
That's... That's good,
Clark. You got me.

47:33.616 --> 47:34.951
Look at me.

47:39.755 --> 47:41.558
Oh, my God!

47:43.092 --> 47:46.860
This is insane. But it makes
total sense. You...

47:46.862 --> 47:50.096
You always showed up around the same time.
It was like you were just there.

47:50.098 --> 47:52.965
And you were good,
too good.

47:52.967 --> 47:57.538
Oh, my God, this is so unethical.
You wrote stories about yourself.

47:57.540 --> 47:59.873
Well, yeah, but only
a couple of times.

47:59.875 --> 48:01.808
I really wanted the job.

48:01.810 --> 48:05.112
You never take vacations, you
never sweat, you never tan...

48:05.114 --> 48:08.748
Are those people
even your parents?

48:08.750 --> 48:12.018
They are, but you know,
it's complicated.

48:12.020 --> 48:15.221
Oh, my God!
You're from another planet!

48:15.223 --> 48:18.257
My boyfriend's
from another planet.

48:18.259 --> 48:22.996
Listen, Lois, I'm just a guy from a small
town who wants to do the right thing.

48:22.998 --> 48:26.699
But doing what I do could
put my family in danger.

48:26.701 --> 48:30.704
I did this so that they wouldn't
have to pay for my choices.

48:30.706 --> 48:33.773
And now you want me
to live with it, too.

48:33.775 --> 48:37.714
I hope you can, because there's been
something else I've been keeping secret.

48:39.147 --> 48:42.518
You want to get that?

48:45.821 --> 48:50.123
Jimmy, I'm busy.
Call back... What?

48:50.125 --> 48:52.759
What? Speak up,
I can't hear you.

48:52.761 --> 48:55.895
Chief wants you on the chopper.
I'll be right there!

48:55.897 --> 48:58.998
- What, why?
- A monster's heading towards Metropolis.

48:59.000 --> 49:02.001
He's already taken out
half the Justice League.

49:02.003 --> 49:03.806
Well, I guess you must have heard...

49:07.743 --> 49:08.777
...that.

50:02.331 --> 50:03.730
Can you tell what
he's thinking?

50:03.732 --> 50:05.898
No real thoughts.

50:05.900 --> 50:10.038
It's all aggressive, all about the fight.
Killing machine.

50:19.915 --> 50:22.018
No!

50:45.139 --> 50:46.842
Batman, heads up!

51:11.165 --> 51:14.900
Not looking too good, Cyborg.

51:14.902 --> 51:18.739
We can take this creep.
Come on! Let's...

51:18.741 --> 51:21.043
Come on!

51:25.179 --> 51:27.449
Where is that monstrosity?

51:29.485 --> 51:32.455
South. Heading
towards Metropolis.

51:36.991 --> 51:39.259
We need you, Clark.

51:46.134 --> 51:48.467
I call you out, monster!

52:40.522 --> 52:42.324
<i>I compel you to surrender!</i>

52:56.170 --> 52:58.940
<i>You may resist
the lasso, mindless creature.</i>

53:00.174 --> 53:02.110
But by Hera,
you will fall!

54:02.203 --> 54:03.503
Diana?

54:03.505 --> 54:05.304
I should have
gotten here sooner.

54:05.306 --> 54:09.141
Not your fault.

54:09.143 --> 54:11.413
You wait here, okay?

54:14.516 --> 54:18.253
Wait. Take him down, Clark.

54:19.587 --> 54:20.856
Don't hold back.

54:22.023 --> 54:24.025
Or he'll kill everyone.

54:36.103 --> 54:40.275
I don't know what hole you crawled
out of or where you came from,

54:41.677 --> 54:43.913
but I'm sending you back.

55:25.020 --> 55:27.353
This creature has not been
identified by the government

55:27.355 --> 55:29.688
<i>and is rumored to have left
members of the Justice League</i>

55:29.690 --> 55:31.724
<i>wounded or near death
in Carlon Heights.</i>

55:31.726 --> 55:35.195
Hey, if you ain't gotta place to go,

55:35.197 --> 55:39.032
you can stay with me while Superman
cleans this clown's clock.

55:39.034 --> 55:40.636
I'll be here for you.

55:42.436 --> 55:45.373
<i>Just like my buddy Supes
is always there for us.</i>

55:47.275 --> 55:49.509
Question is, will
Superman once again

55:49.511 --> 55:53.679
meet the challenge and keep this
Doomsday out of Metropolis?

55:53.681 --> 55:55.514
You heard her, people,

55:55.516 --> 55:57.282
Lois has given
this thing a name.

55:57.284 --> 56:00.587
Doomsday. Let's get on it.
We need a new Page 1.

56:00.589 --> 56:03.690
Yeah, if there's
anyone left to read it.

56:03.692 --> 56:06.326
<i>Superman may be
the only hope Metropolis has.</i>

56:06.328 --> 56:09.065
<i>In the past,
that's always been enough.</i>

56:12.234 --> 56:14.703
Oh, please,
cry me a river.

56:17.706 --> 56:22.345
<i>Fascinating. What kind of
civilization would produce that?</i>

56:23.578 --> 56:26.779
It seems its only
function is destruction.

56:26.781 --> 56:30.750
Perhaps it's a weapon. A first
strike meant to wipe out all life

56:30.752 --> 56:33.286
on a planet for
a conquering force.

56:33.288 --> 56:35.822
<i>That would explain
why it's come to Metropolis.</i>

56:35.824 --> 56:38.391
It's drawn to
population centers.

56:38.393 --> 56:41.226
Who besides me would
send an apex predator here

56:41.228 --> 56:43.431
to kill the strongest
thing it could find?

56:47.101 --> 56:49.601
You think it might
kill Superman?

56:49.603 --> 56:52.007
It would save me
a lot of trouble.

56:58.179 --> 57:01.815
But what if the caped
wonder can't bring him down?

57:01.817 --> 57:04.587
Metropolis will still
need to be protected.

57:16.831 --> 57:22.634
Luckily, it's a day I've been
planning for a long time.

57:22.636 --> 57:25.137
<i>The United States
metahuman adviser department</i>

57:25.139 --> 57:27.576
<i>is recommending all civilians
head to safety zones.</i>

57:37.853 --> 57:40.121
Get out of the car, get out of the car!
Come on!

58:56.598 --> 58:58.701
Get out of here!

59:32.801 --> 59:34.436
Joey, no!

59:44.478 --> 59:46.247
<i>Somebody,
help my child!</i>

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.406
Get back to your mom, son.
Everything's going to be okay.

01:01:05.527 --> 01:01:08.530
Oh, man! Superman's
not looking good.

01:01:48.369 --> 01:01:49.705
Huh?

01:01:59.913 --> 01:02:01.713
I've got you.

01:02:01.715 --> 01:02:05.717
You've got me?
But who's got you?

01:02:05.719 --> 01:02:07.487
We need to call in
the cavalry.

01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:10.389
I am the cavalry.

01:02:17.031 --> 01:02:20.599
You can't go back after
that thing. It's suicide!

01:02:20.601 --> 01:02:22.370
So was following
in a chopper.

01:02:28.942 --> 01:02:31.446
I have to get back to work.

01:03:28.735 --> 01:03:31.070
Come on, Jimmy.

01:03:31.072 --> 01:03:32.975
<i>At this point, it's impossible
to tell who's the victor.</i>

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:37.178
Though Superman has
come from behind before...

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:53.028
<i>Lane, Olsen,
keep the camera rolling.</i>

01:03:55.596 --> 01:03:57.198
<i>You'll wanna get this.</i>

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.138
<i>You think taking down the Justice
League is supposed to scare us?</i>

01:04:05.172 --> 01:04:06.841
<i>That happens once a week.</i>

01:04:14.181 --> 01:04:17.084
<i>I don't know where you've
come from, you alien scum.</i>

01:04:21.522 --> 01:04:24.257
<i>But you've picked
the wrong city.</i>

01:04:24.259 --> 01:04:26.661
<i>And the wrong human.</i>

01:04:28.128 --> 01:04:30.996
<i>Metropolis is,
and always has been,</i>

01:04:30.998 --> 01:04:36.101
<i>under the protection of Lex
Luthor, you son of a bitch!</i>

01:04:39.574 --> 01:04:41.210
Now to get a piece of you.

01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:57.793
Step back,
you freak of nature!

01:04:59.127 --> 01:05:02.328
No! Stay away from me.

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:06.268
I am Lex Luthor!
I'm supposed to win.

01:05:09.971 --> 01:05:13.105
No! I'm supposed to win.

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:33.127
No!

01:07:24.906 --> 01:07:28.976
Clark?

01:07:30.043 --> 01:07:31.346
I got your note.

01:07:47.427 --> 01:07:49.096
And I love you, too.

01:08:11.185 --> 01:08:13.822
No!

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:53.492
Stay with me.
Please, stay with me.

01:08:55.395 --> 01:09:00.064
That thing... Is he?

01:09:00.066 --> 01:09:01.966
Yes.

01:09:01.968 --> 01:09:05.305
You did it.
You saved everyone.

01:09:09.042 --> 01:09:13.814
Good. It's all
I ever wanted.

01:09:16.917 --> 01:09:18.819
Except for you.

01:09:20.386 --> 01:09:25.158
What a lucky man I was.

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:39.002
No! No, no, no!

01:11:01.688 --> 01:11:04.622
<i>Superman was
an example that inspired us</i>

01:11:04.624 --> 01:11:10.128
to reach beyond ourselves, to
soar towards a better tomorrow.

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:15.333
<i>He was a hero to Metropolis but
more importantly, he was a friend.</i>

01:11:15.335 --> 01:11:17.502
Really, sorry, sir.
I need you to step back a bit.

01:11:17.504 --> 01:11:20.005
<i>...his powers
were truly amazing.</i>

01:11:20.007 --> 01:11:22.440
Is she gonna be okay?

01:11:22.442 --> 01:11:28.447
Yes, Officer. It's just
a big loss for everyone.

01:11:28.449 --> 01:11:33.085
Yeah, Superman was kinda
like family, wasn't he?

01:11:33.087 --> 01:11:36.020
Of course,
he didn't act alone.

01:11:36.022 --> 01:11:39.358
<i>The Justice League also
put their lives on the line</i>

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.595
<i>against this brutal,
incomprehensible evil.</i>

01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:46.165
<i>In many ways,
I'm sure they feel the loss</i>

01:11:46.167 --> 01:11:49.271
<i>of their leader and comrade,
most of all.</i>

01:12:09.356 --> 01:12:13.492
And let us not forget the
quick action from Lex Luthor,

01:12:13.494 --> 01:12:17.695
who allowed Superman the time
he needed to save us all.

01:12:17.697 --> 01:12:20.668
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Lex Luthor.

01:12:31.544 --> 01:12:34.046
Thank you, Mayor Booker.

01:12:34.048 --> 01:12:37.649
It's no secret Superman
and I had our differences,

01:12:37.651 --> 01:12:40.519
but this wasn't
always the case.

01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:43.788
You would be surprised all
the times he came to visit.

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:47.592
The wisdom he would impart.

01:12:47.594 --> 01:12:51.465
I will miss those late night
chats on my balcony.

01:13:16.456 --> 01:13:21.362
For Superman,
always in our hearts.

01:13:46.152 --> 01:13:51.756
<i>Hail Mary, full of
Grace, the Lord is with thee.</i>

01:13:51.758 --> 01:13:54.460
<i>Blessed are thou
among women</i>

01:13:54.462 --> 01:13:58.831
<i>and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

01:13:58.833 --> 01:14:01.201
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,</i>

01:14:02.736 --> 01:14:05.770
<i>pray for us sinners,</i>

01:14:05.772 --> 01:14:09.177
<i>now and at the hour
of our death.</i>

01:14:09.776 --> 01:14:11.145
<i>Amen.</i>

01:14:15.281 --> 01:14:18.317
Why would you
let Superman die

01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:21.755
when a washed up old roughneck
like me goes on living?

01:14:24.391 --> 01:14:26.324
It ain't right, God.

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:31.162
It just ain't right.

01:14:51.218 --> 01:14:54.252
<i>I don't understand
your hesitation, Dr. Klyburn.</i>

01:14:54.254 --> 01:14:57.256
If S.T.A.R. Lab's research on
the alien corpse is complete,

01:14:57.258 --> 01:15:01.193
Project Cadmus is perfectly suited to
house it until it's ready for disposal.

01:15:01.195 --> 01:15:05.197
It's fine here. LexCorp just needs
to get the payload rocket ready

01:15:05.199 --> 01:15:07.265
so the government can get
this creature off planet

01:15:07.267 --> 01:15:09.201
before it lands
in the wrong hands.

01:15:09.203 --> 01:15:11.435
You know I've been
exonerated, yes?

01:15:11.437 --> 01:15:14.206
You and your S.T.A.R. bureaucrats
can't keep trying me

01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:16.341
for crimes I've been
cleared of.

01:15:16.343 --> 01:15:20.546
You may have been cleared, Luthor,
but no one thinks you're innocent.

01:15:20.548 --> 01:15:24.716
As far as I'm concerned, Cadmus is a
genetic pirate ship posing as research...

01:15:41.634 --> 01:15:43.704
Someone track it.
Where's it going?

01:15:44.804 --> 01:15:47.142
Up, up and away.

01:16:00.721 --> 01:16:02.223
<i>No one's
touched a thing.</i>

01:16:04.258 --> 01:16:08.426
I know. I just wanted to
check in on him.

01:16:08.428 --> 01:16:11.796
You know, there's still a lot of
people missing after the battle.

01:16:11.798 --> 01:16:14.265
They're being found every day.

01:16:14.267 --> 01:16:15.967
Clark will show up.

01:16:15.969 --> 01:16:18.806
He's got the best reason
of all to return.

01:16:22.243 --> 01:16:24.443
Thanks, Cat.

01:16:24.445 --> 01:16:26.744
- Louis! Good you're still here.
- Yeah. What's going on?

01:16:26.746 --> 01:16:28.512
Police scanners.
Come on!

01:16:28.514 --> 01:16:29.948
Jim, I'm in no mood to chase
a story right now.

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:32.387
You will be. Trust me!
You drive.

01:16:41.794 --> 01:16:44.262
- Is it true?
- <i>You tell me.</i>

01:16:50.004 --> 01:16:51.839
Oh, my God!

01:16:59.045 --> 01:17:00.514
Superman?

01:18:10.639 --> 01:18:15.639
