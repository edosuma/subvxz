00:17.101 --> 00:19.366
Shit. Oh, my God.

00:19.401 --> 00:21.334
- Oh, Jesus.
- They're all right.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.498
They're okay.

00:22.533 --> 00:24.134
They brought the kids
over to the ambulance.

00:24.169 --> 00:25.465
Oh, thank God.

00:25.500 --> 00:26.700
Tommy, look, look,
listen to me.

00:26.735 --> 00:27.665
Don't tell me this.

00:27.700 --> 00:28.932
The kids are gone, Tommy.

00:28.967 --> 00:30.800
Janet, too.
Nobody helped them.

00:30.835 --> 00:32.484
- They're dead.
- No.

00:32.519 --> 00:34.109
It was an arsonist.

00:34.144 --> 00:35.700
Come on,
Tommy. Easy.

00:35.735 --> 00:36.765
Easy, champ.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.533
- Where is he?
- Going into the squad car.

00:40.533 --> 00:42.383
Tommy, Tommy! Come on.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.234
Tommy! Don't do this!

00:49.401 --> 00:51.201
Sir... we have him.
We have him under--

00:51.236 --> 00:52.434
We have him.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.834
Look at me, asshole! Hey!

00:58.869 --> 01:00.366
Hey!

01:00.401 --> 01:01.800
Look at me!

01:04.632 --> 01:06.333
Engine.

01:06.368 --> 01:08.301
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:10.510 --> 01:12.480
This your first West Side
highway call, kid?

01:12.512 --> 01:14.033
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Well, get used to it.

01:14.062 --> 01:15.540
Weekends, we get
three or four of these.

01:15.555 --> 01:16.994
Yeah, teenagers come over
from Jersey,

01:17.020 --> 01:18.433
go into the clubs,
get drunk and high.

01:18.468 --> 01:20.267
And then they drive home
7000 miles an hour,

01:20.302 --> 01:22.032
trying to make it out of town
before curfew.

01:22.067 --> 01:24.267
Can't they do something about
it? Put some cops out there?

01:24.285 --> 01:26.125
They're kids. They're gonna do
what they wanna do.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.219
Yeah, plus, it keeps the
population of Jersey in check,

01:28.255 --> 01:29.979
which I think
we're all in favor of.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.032
Wasn't that funny, Bill.

01:33.067 --> 01:36.368
Huh? Oh. I was laughing
at something else.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.750
Hey, you read about that guy
in the paper?

01:50.785 --> 01:52.934
Yeah, the guy in Queens
that ate his in-laws?

01:52.969 --> 01:54.166
No, the other guy, 74 truck.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.600
He retires,
comes out of the closet.

01:56.635 --> 01:58.166
Gay?

01:58.201 --> 01:59.166
Yeah, and get this.

01:59.201 --> 02:00.865
He says there's a secret society

02:00.900 --> 02:02.665
within the brotherhood
of the F.D.N.Y.

02:02.700 --> 02:05.167
Says he knew 20 guys
that died on 9/11 that were gay.

02:05.202 --> 02:06.799
What?

02:06.834 --> 02:08.383
This was in the papers?

02:08.419 --> 02:09.899
- Yep.
- I didn't see it.

02:09.934 --> 02:12.167
Saw the thing about
the guy eating his parents.

02:12.202 --> 02:13.632
No, they were his in-laws.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.732
Oh, well.
Who hasn't wanted to do that?

02:15.767 --> 02:19.867
By the way, how do you prove
20 of these guys were gay?

02:19.902 --> 02:21.498
You know how you prove it?

02:21.533 --> 02:23.133
You look at a poster
of the 343,

02:23.168 --> 02:24.699
pick out the 20
best-looking guys.

02:24.734 --> 02:27.134
Those are the ones the fags
are gonna claim were gay.

02:27.169 --> 02:28.565
- What do you mean?
- Well,

02:28.600 --> 02:30.201
it's always
the handsome sons of bitches.

02:30.236 --> 02:31.600
It's always Tom Cruise
and Brad Pitt

02:31.635 --> 02:32.966
that they say are gay.

02:33.001 --> 02:35.134
It's never, you know,
Donald Trump or Dennis Franz...

02:35.169 --> 02:36.301
Jim Belushi.

02:36.336 --> 02:37.399
Jim Belushi.

02:37.434 --> 02:39.633
Donald Trump's gay?

02:41.101 --> 02:42.468
Get out of the truck.

02:55.767 --> 02:57.132
You know, Tommy,
I read a statistic

02:57.167 --> 02:59.134
that said 10 percent of the
population is gay.

02:59.169 --> 03:00.735
- Bullshit.
- Nah. Think about it.

03:00.770 --> 03:02.266
According to that percentage,

03:02.301 --> 03:04.301
out of our crew,
at least one guy is gay.

03:04.336 --> 03:05.266
Really?

03:05.301 --> 03:08.067
My God! Somebody, help!

03:08.102 --> 03:09.132
Oh, my God!

03:09.167 --> 03:11.633
15 Battalion K.
Tommy, go check that out.

03:11.668 --> 03:12.598
Yeah, yeah.

03:12.633 --> 03:14.017
Sean, help Franco

03:14.052 --> 03:15.366
with that generator

03:15.401 --> 03:16.667
on the other side
of the rig.

03:29.034 --> 03:30.567
I wanna go home.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.117
What's goin' on?

03:33.152 --> 03:34.567
Uh... she's gone.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.567
Battalion 1-5 to 1-5 Alpha.

03:39.602 --> 03:41.832
Transmit a 10-45.

03:41.867 --> 03:44.034
Make that two 10-45s,
one a code 2.

03:47.967 --> 03:49.333
Hey, Tommy, you okay?

03:49.368 --> 03:52.201
Yeah, yeah. No, I just...
feel a cold coming on.

03:52.236 --> 03:54.101
- An Irish remedy.
- Right.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.401
Shit.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.411
GAY

04:57.267 --> 04:59.468
Somebody oughta tell
this faggot what's what.

04:59.503 --> 05:00.868
No respect, huh?
Widows, families.

05:00.903 --> 05:02.199
How does he even know
they're gay?

05:02.234 --> 05:03.950
I mean, does he have sex
with all of them?

05:03.985 --> 05:05.667
Was there some kind
of secret handshake?

05:05.702 --> 05:07.032
I'm on the job 20 years,

05:07.067 --> 05:08.867
and I never seen one guy
that's a faggot,

05:08.902 --> 05:10.685
and all of sudden
they're tellin' me

05:10.720 --> 05:12.433
20 guys are takin' it
right up the ass?

05:12.468 --> 05:15.301
Well, maybe they weren't,
necessarily, you know, gay.

05:15.336 --> 05:16.899
Maybe he just
thought they were gay

05:16.934 --> 05:19.867
because they dressed nice
and were well-groomed

05:19.902 --> 05:21.068
and into fashion.

05:21.103 --> 05:22.234
Know what I mean?

05:24.034 --> 05:25.251
No.

05:25.286 --> 05:26.433
What?

05:26.468 --> 05:28.351
Maybe they weren't homosexuals.

05:28.386 --> 05:30.234
Maybe they were metrosexuals.

05:30.269 --> 05:31.266
What?

05:31.301 --> 05:32.934
My daughter used that term
last week.

05:32.969 --> 05:34.135
The teenager?

05:34.170 --> 05:35.266
The 8-year-old.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.734
What in the sweet
chocolate Christ

05:36.769 --> 05:38.732
is a metrosexual?

05:38.767 --> 05:39.732
It means you aren't gay,

05:39.767 --> 05:41.233
but you like to do
certain things

05:41.268 --> 05:42.700
that might be
considered gay.

05:44.600 --> 05:45.765
Right?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.199
No, asshole.

05:47.234 --> 05:49.034
He doesn't know what the hell
he's talkin about.

05:49.069 --> 05:50.932
Look, a metrosexual
is like a straight guy

05:50.967 --> 05:53.734
who also happens to like
to, you know, go shopping

05:53.769 --> 05:57.600
and get facials
and stuff.

05:57.635 --> 05:58.565
Holy shit.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.267
Shoppin' for food?

06:00.302 --> 06:01.232
Nice food.

06:01.276 --> 06:03.919
Yeah. And wine and...
clothes.

06:03.957 --> 06:05.424
Yeah.
I'm not explaining it right.

06:05.468 --> 06:07.067
Franco, you know what
a metrosexual is, right?

06:07.102 --> 06:08.401
Uh, that would be

06:08.436 --> 06:09.665
a huge goddamn no.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.667
Look, it's not, like,
a gay thing, all right?

06:11.702 --> 06:13.585
It's gay,
and it's not gay.

06:13.620 --> 06:16.076
It's like straight, regular guys

06:16.111 --> 06:18.533
who get facelifts
and bikini waxes.

06:18.568 --> 06:19.932
Enough. Enough.

06:19.967 --> 06:21.817
- Male bikini waxes.
- Enough!

06:21.852 --> 06:23.632
Nobody in this firehouse

06:23.667 --> 06:25.567
goes out
and goes shoppin' anymore

06:25.602 --> 06:27.468
unless it's for
underwear or boots

06:27.503 --> 06:29.218
or a pair
of goddamn gloves.

06:29.253 --> 06:30.934
And nobody, and I mean nobody,

06:30.969 --> 06:32.465
goes and gets
a facial,

06:32.500 --> 06:34.368
unless that means puttin'
water on your face

06:34.403 --> 06:36.966
to clean it up
after you catch a job.

06:37.001 --> 06:39.267
And the word "metrosexual,"
from this point on,

06:39.302 --> 06:41.667
is banned from these quarters.

06:45.368 --> 06:47.433
What the hell's
a male bikini wax?

06:47.468 --> 06:49.800
It's when they take the hair
off of your scrotum.

06:49.835 --> 06:50.817
Ow.

06:50.852 --> 06:51.765
Why?

06:51.800 --> 06:52.765
Chicks dig it.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.400
Chicks dig us
shaving our balls?

06:54.435 --> 06:56.001
No, no.
It's hot-wax strips.

06:56.036 --> 06:56.999
Yeah. They yank 'em off,

06:57.034 --> 06:58.533
and the ball hair comes with it,

06:58.568 --> 07:00.199
along with the pubic hair.

07:00.234 --> 07:03.301
You know, I had that
procedure done.

07:03.336 --> 07:04.366
Really? When?

07:04.401 --> 07:05.667
Yeah. Back in the '70s.

07:05.702 --> 07:06.632
By who?

07:06.667 --> 07:08.232
The sisters of St. Mary.

07:08.267 --> 07:10.700
You ladies had better
shut this shit down.

07:10.735 --> 07:11.567
Wow.

07:24.967 --> 07:26.199
Oh. Good.

07:26.234 --> 07:28.234
Is Connor's lunchbox
at your place?

07:28.269 --> 07:29.232
Hi.

07:29.267 --> 07:30.667
He didn't come home
with it today,

07:30.702 --> 07:32.032
and if it's not at your place,

07:32.067 --> 07:34.034
that's three lunchboxes
this year.

07:34.069 --> 07:35.199
So this is the urgent thing

07:35.234 --> 07:37.234
you had to have me come over
and talk about.

07:37.269 --> 07:40.032
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

07:40.067 --> 07:41.799
It's just making me
a little crazy.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.934
I swear to God, Tom,
and don't think I'm nuts.

07:43.969 --> 07:46.034
I swear this is his way
of getting back at me

07:46.069 --> 07:47.665
for you and I splitting up.

07:47.700 --> 07:50.734
He loses one more lunchbox,
I'm calling a therapist.

07:50.769 --> 07:52.201
For him or for you?

07:53.201 --> 07:54.201
Janet?

07:54.236 --> 07:55.166
Aw, great.

07:55.201 --> 07:57.267
Shit. He's early.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.584
Ah, in here.

07:58.619 --> 07:59.867
You here, babe?

07:59.902 --> 08:01.232
Kitchen!

08:01.267 --> 08:03.267
You know, maybe your boyfriend
stole Connor's lunchbox.

08:03.302 --> 08:04.433
You ever think of that?

08:04.468 --> 08:05.900
Maybe he's got
a little lunchbox fetish

08:05.935 --> 08:07.401
going on.

08:07.436 --> 08:08.867
Oh, sorry.

08:10.401 --> 08:11.767
How's it going?

08:11.802 --> 08:13.334
Good.

08:13.369 --> 08:14.832
Good.

08:14.867 --> 08:19.934
Um, so, Roger,
this is Tommy, my ex.

08:19.969 --> 08:21.567
Roger Mills.
We meet at last.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.199
How you doing?

08:23.234 --> 08:26.266
Reservation's at 7.

08:26.301 --> 08:27.932
Okay. I'm gonna
get dressed.

08:27.967 --> 08:30.667
And you'll look for
that lunchbox?

08:30.702 --> 08:32.565
Yeah, babe.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.567
So you're a firefighter.

08:34.602 --> 08:36.131
Yep.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.765
My hat's off to you, man.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.933
I mean, seriously,
the work you guys do.

08:39.969 --> 08:42.068
Look at me,
wearing my monkey suit,

08:42.102 --> 08:44.131
stuck in some
big office building.

08:44.167 --> 08:47.234
Compared to the work you do,
I feel like a... wuss.

08:47.269 --> 08:49.034
Well, that's not the word
I would've picked,

08:49.069 --> 08:50.565
but that'll do.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.632
Funny.
Hey, listen.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.934
I know there's a fund
for firefighters

08:54.969 --> 08:56.366
for the widows
and the orphans.

08:56.401 --> 08:57.832
I've always wanted
to make a donation,

08:57.867 --> 09:00.600
but I forget, or I'm busy,
or I'm traveling.

09:00.635 --> 09:02.066
Let me give you a check.

09:02.101 --> 09:04.001
You'll get it where it
has to go, right?

09:04.036 --> 09:05.299
Yeah. Probably.

09:05.334 --> 09:07.184
You are funny.

09:07.219 --> 09:08.943
There you go.

09:08.978 --> 09:10.667
Least I can do.

09:11.667 --> 09:12.632
Thanks.

09:12.667 --> 09:13.867
You're welcome.

09:17.167 --> 09:21.267
Hey. Let me ask you something.

09:21.302 --> 09:22.500
You in love with my wife?

09:25.567 --> 09:27.699
Um...

09:27.734 --> 09:29.900
I don't really know how
to respond

09:29.935 --> 09:31.351
to that question.

09:31.386 --> 09:32.732
I'm not sure that I--

09:32.767 --> 09:34.334
That's all I wanted to hear.

09:38.401 --> 09:40.001
Nice to meet you, Rog.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.267
See ya.

09:49.468 --> 09:50.834
Cheap prick.

09:55.267 --> 09:56.750
There you go, guys.

09:56.785 --> 09:58.409
Grab a corn dog.

09:58.444 --> 09:59.999
Okay, everybody?

10:00.034 --> 10:02.301
- Yeah. John Gavin.
- Johnny boy.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.159
Hey, Tommy.

10:03.190 --> 10:05.415
Listen, I tapped
into Roger's credit report,

10:05.447 --> 10:07.444
and I futzed around
with the numbers a little bit.

10:07.473 --> 10:10.083
Guy makes 2 mil a year,
by the way. You know that?

10:10.122 --> 10:10.735
Shit.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.167
Plus, on top of that,
he just put down a down payment

10:13.202 --> 10:15.218
on a three-bedroom house
in San Jose.

10:15.253 --> 10:17.234
Don't spill anything
in there, now, guys.

10:17.269 --> 10:18.633
It gets better.
Hold on a second.

10:18.668 --> 10:19.598
What else?

10:19.633 --> 10:20.767
Roger Mills, 42 years old,

10:20.802 --> 10:22.032
busted twice for DWI

10:22.067 --> 10:24.167
outside San Francisco
about 10 years ago.

10:24.202 --> 10:25.266
And get this:

10:25.301 --> 10:27.600
a public lewdness charge
that he pleaded down

10:27.635 --> 10:28.767
and did community service for.

10:28.802 --> 10:29.865
What does that mean?

10:29.900 --> 10:31.600
Take your pick,
but he either got busted

10:31.635 --> 10:33.266
for taking it
up the ass in the park

10:33.301 --> 10:35.900
or getting a blowjob from a girl
in the backseat of his car,

10:35.935 --> 10:37.934
but when you plead down,
the details just go away.

10:37.969 --> 10:39.199
What, he's a fag?

10:39.234 --> 10:41.034
I don't know, but it is
San Francisco, right?

10:41.069 --> 10:42.199
Of course,
if he is gay,

10:42.234 --> 10:44.034
then what the hell
is he doing with Janet?

10:44.069 --> 10:44.999
Taking a breather?

10:45.034 --> 10:46.034
Yeah, what, they do that?

10:46.069 --> 10:47.399
How would I know?

10:47.434 --> 10:49.834
I don't know. I got a phone
call. Hold on a second.

10:49.869 --> 10:50.899
John Gavin.

10:50.934 --> 10:52.734
Hey, you guys got stuff
to drink in there?

10:52.769 --> 10:53.818
Uncle Johnny,
it's Damian.

10:53.853 --> 10:54.993
Hey, Damian,
what's up, kid?

10:55.028 --> 10:56.099
All right,
I sent a virus

10:56.134 --> 10:59.017
through that guy Roger's
office computer system,

10:59.052 --> 11:01.900
and I red-flagged his
Platinum American Express

11:01.935 --> 11:03.568
and his main Mastercard
debit card.

11:03.603 --> 11:05.166
Oh, yeah? How long's that
gonna last?

11:05.201 --> 11:07.600
Well, he won't be able
to get cash out of an ATM

11:07.635 --> 11:09.067
for at least a day.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.132
Nice.

11:10.167 --> 11:11.632
And it'll take
two days at least

11:11.667 --> 11:14.267
for him and his company to get
his full credit back on track.

11:14.302 --> 11:15.333
That's good work, Damian.

11:15.368 --> 11:17.167
Listen, tell your mom I say hi,
all right?

11:17.202 --> 11:18.368
- I gotta bounce.
- All right.

11:18.403 --> 11:20.066
Tommy, I'm back.

11:20.101 --> 11:22.401
Listen, Damian just came
through big-time for us.

11:22.436 --> 11:23.732
Speaking of fags.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.084
Come on, Damian is not
a fag. Damian's a geek.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.160
And your friend Roger's
gonna have a hard time

11:28.195 --> 11:30.201
getting to his finances
over the next 48 hours.

11:30.236 --> 11:31.498
Nice. Keep digging.

11:31.533 --> 11:33.166
Yeah. Listen,
do me a favor.

11:33.201 --> 11:34.800
- Please call Dad.
- Yeah, I will.

11:34.835 --> 11:35.734
All right.

11:38.474 --> 11:40.615
You got my kid
doing your dirty work.

11:40.645 --> 11:43.085
Look, my wife's thinking
of moving to California

11:43.118 --> 11:44.773
with the kids
and some strange guy.

11:44.810 --> 11:46.613
I think I owe it to the kids
to check the guy out.

11:46.668 --> 11:48.484
How is...
Damian?

11:48.519 --> 11:50.266
He's a geek, Jim.

11:50.301 --> 11:52.234
Come on. That's not funny.
Why you say that?

11:52.269 --> 11:54.167
There's not much
I can do about it now, anyway.

11:54.202 --> 11:56.834
Yeah, well...

11:59.600 --> 12:01.500
Had another dead person
talk to me last night.

12:02.734 --> 12:05.999
Asian girl
on the West Side highway.

12:06.034 --> 12:08.834
Really? So this "starting
to drink again" thing,

12:08.869 --> 12:10.434
it's really working out well
for you, huh?

12:12.267 --> 12:13.498
What she want?

12:13.533 --> 12:15.800
She said,
"I wanna go home."

12:16.867 --> 12:18.799
Join the club, kid.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.999
What's that supposed to mean?

12:21.034 --> 12:23.034
What's it supposed to mean?
Put yourself in my shoes.

12:23.069 --> 12:25.099
I'm supposed
to spend eternity here,

12:25.134 --> 12:27.667
arguing with you about
your little secret evil plans

12:27.702 --> 12:29.999
to fix your
failing marriage?

12:30.034 --> 12:32.633
Come on, this can't be
my final resting place.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.865
- What if it is?
- What if?

12:34.900 --> 12:36.266
What if I'm not even here, Tom?

12:36.301 --> 12:38.417
What if I'm a figment
of your imagination?

12:38.452 --> 12:40.533
No. If you were a figment
of my imagination,

12:40.568 --> 12:41.732
you wouldn't be arguing with me.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.368
You'd be helping me
to solve the problem.

12:43.403 --> 12:45.333
Which problem?

12:45.368 --> 12:47.201
Wife Problem?
The drinking problem?

12:47.236 --> 12:48.301
Or the ghost thing?

12:48.336 --> 12:49.902
Really funny.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.433
Dad!

12:51.468 --> 12:53.267
Connor stole
some of my potatoes.

12:53.302 --> 12:54.567
Then Colleen
called me

12:54.602 --> 12:55.699
a pig.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.434
Honey, first of all,
you are not a pig, okay?

12:58.469 --> 13:00.999
You are a gorgeous
little princess.

13:01.034 --> 13:03.468
All right?
Now, go tell Connor to shut up.

13:03.503 --> 13:04.433
Okay.

13:04.468 --> 13:06.966
Tell him Dad said so.

13:07.001 --> 13:08.632
And, Colleen,
another crack like that,

13:08.667 --> 13:10.401
you ain't getting those jeans,
you hear me?

13:14.301 --> 13:15.333
Tell you what:

13:15.368 --> 13:16.600
because you're such
a good dad,

13:16.635 --> 13:17.999
and I mean that,

13:18.034 --> 13:20.034
I-I-I'm gonna try
to help you here, all right.

13:20.069 --> 13:21.598
But you gotta do me a favor.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.867
You gotta check in on Sheila
for me, all right?

13:23.902 --> 13:25.301
Just make sure
she's not dating anybody.

13:25.336 --> 13:26.799
All right. You know what?

13:26.834 --> 13:29.034
I've seen you disappear into
thin air in this house, okay?

13:29.069 --> 13:31.368
You're telling me you can't fly
over, like, 10 blocks

13:31.403 --> 13:33.667
and then materialize
in your ex-wife's living room?

13:33.702 --> 13:35.067
No. And that would be my widow.

13:35.102 --> 13:36.032
It would be

13:36.067 --> 13:37.101
my widow's
living room.

13:37.136 --> 13:38.066
Sorry.

13:38.101 --> 13:39.699
Tell you what.
I'll check in.

13:39.734 --> 13:41.734
See who she's dating,
how things are going.

13:41.769 --> 13:43.099
But you got
to keep an eye

13:43.134 --> 13:45.134
on this house across
the street from me, all right?

13:45.169 --> 13:47.468
I'm serious, man.
I got a bad feeling here.

13:47.503 --> 13:48.633
I do, too.

13:52.468 --> 13:53.999
Yeah?

13:54.034 --> 13:55.700
Tom, this is Jerry.
You got a minute?

13:55.735 --> 13:56.800
Hey, what's going on?

13:58.201 --> 14:00.934
That guy in the paper today,
the gay guy?

14:00.969 --> 14:02.066
Yeah?

14:02.101 --> 14:03.701
I did some
digging around.

14:03.736 --> 14:05.266
His name is Bobby Teff,

14:05.301 --> 14:08.368
but it didn't say in the paper
what company he retired out of.

14:08.403 --> 14:09.968
You didn't know this guy,
did ya?

14:10.003 --> 14:11.533
Bobby Teff.
That rings a bell.

14:11.568 --> 14:14.399
Bobby Teff. You know what?

14:14.434 --> 14:17.067
Yeah, I think he was in
Mikey Brown's crew for a while.

14:17.102 --> 14:18.032
You know, he was,

14:18.067 --> 14:19.567
because I remember
Mikey telling me

14:19.602 --> 14:21.067
what a pain in the ass
the guy was.

14:21.102 --> 14:23.199
Oh, that's no surprise.

14:23.234 --> 14:24.817
Look, you think
you could ask Mikey

14:24.852 --> 14:26.366
to get some information
for me?

14:26.401 --> 14:28.067
Why? What are you thinking
of doing?

14:28.102 --> 14:29.532
Oh, no, nothing.

14:29.567 --> 14:32.267
I just thought I'd maybe like
to have a talk with the guy.

14:32.302 --> 14:33.433
That's all. No big deal.

14:33.468 --> 14:35.334
Just have Mikey check
and get back to me.

14:35.369 --> 14:37.418
All right. What is it
with these gay people?

14:37.453 --> 14:39.433
They're everywhere now.
Sitcoms, movies.

14:39.468 --> 14:41.368
See the thing in the paper
about same-sex marriage?

14:41.403 --> 14:42.932
Same-sex marriages?

14:42.967 --> 14:46.134
Hey, right now I'd settle
for a some-sex marriage.

14:46.169 --> 14:47.700
All right. Talk to you.

15:23.368 --> 15:25.301
I'm telling you, man,
you better be careful.

15:25.336 --> 15:27.984
Yeah. The guy shoots
in the 70s.

15:28.019 --> 15:30.633
I'll see you Saturday
at the club.

15:30.668 --> 15:31.800
Putz.

15:41.900 --> 15:44.067
Hey, Patty, there's
a monster face on my computer.

15:44.102 --> 15:45.201
I can't get rid--

15:46.167 --> 15:47.201
You have
the same thing.

15:47.236 --> 15:48.999
Everybody does.

15:49.034 --> 15:51.267
It's on every computer
in the office.

15:51.302 --> 15:52.399
I called the tech guys.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.201
They said we got hit
with a virus.

15:54.236 --> 15:56.266
Great. Why us?

15:56.301 --> 15:57.500
I think you mean
"why you."

15:57.535 --> 15:58.734
What?

15:58.769 --> 15:59.899
Look.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.001
Now the monster's wearing
a little name tag.

16:02.036 --> 16:04.199
It says,
"Hello. I'm Roger M."

16:04.234 --> 16:07.001
Looks like somebody
really likes you.

16:11.567 --> 16:12.732
- Hey, Franco.
- Yeah.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.834
- Come here a second.
- What's up?

16:16.334 --> 16:17.450
Do I look different?

16:17.485 --> 16:18.532
How do you mean?

16:18.567 --> 16:20.732
I mean, look at me.
Do I look different?

16:20.767 --> 16:23.767
I'm looking at you, Sean.
You wanna help me out here?

16:25.267 --> 16:26.368
Sean.

16:27.434 --> 16:30.101
He, uh, got a ball wax.

16:30.136 --> 16:31.665
- A ball wax?
- Yeah.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.101
Me and this chick
I've been banging,

16:33.136 --> 16:34.199
we were talking about it.

16:34.234 --> 16:36.134
And she says
that it makes the sex better

16:36.169 --> 16:37.232
for women, right?

16:37.267 --> 16:38.632
So there's nothing on TV
last night.

16:38.667 --> 16:41.733
I get out the Yellow Pages.
I find a place and do it.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.800
So this place, did you find it
under "ball" or "wax"?

16:44.835 --> 16:47.867
Place called Invincible.
All-male spa.

16:47.902 --> 16:49.134
It's a cool name, right?

16:49.169 --> 16:51.433
Yeah. Cool.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.117
So, uh, how did it feel?

16:53.152 --> 16:54.732
Well, it hurt like hell,

16:54.767 --> 16:57.434
but now, God, I feel like
I'm 12 years old all over again,

16:57.469 --> 16:58.433
you know?

16:58.468 --> 16:59.632
I feel free, brother.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.468
You realize
you're itching your tea bag

17:01.503 --> 17:02.598
every 10 seconds.

17:02.633 --> 17:04.767
Yeah. I don't think so.

17:09.367 --> 17:10.700
You gotta stop, man.

17:10.734 --> 17:12.267
I can't.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.464
Here you go, guys,
right here.

17:24.500 --> 17:25.767
Folks, please step aside,
all right?

17:28.600 --> 17:30.199
Get that line stretched quick,
will you?

17:30.234 --> 17:32.234
Battalion 1-5, come in.
Transmit a 10-75 at the box.

17:32.269 --> 17:34.034
Chief, how you doing?
We got the super here.

17:34.069 --> 17:35.333
He says everybody's
accounted for

17:35.368 --> 17:37.368
except an older couple
that lives on the second floor

17:37.403 --> 17:39.167
and a guy that lives alone
on the third.

17:39.202 --> 17:40.333
Great. Thanks.

17:40.368 --> 17:42.132
Franco, take the probie
to the third floor.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.567
Tommy, you and Billy and Lou
go up to the second floor.

17:44.602 --> 17:45.999
All right. Upstairs.
Let's go.

17:46.034 --> 17:47.633
9-1-5 to Manhattan.
Transmitting to all hands.

17:47.668 --> 17:48.865
Come on, guys.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.533
We got smoke pushing out
of both floors

17:50.568 --> 17:51.401
and the top floor.

17:52.934 --> 17:55.633
You know, I hear that smoke
is very bad for the skin.

17:55.668 --> 17:57.434
Actually, they have
a cream for that.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.166
Oh. Oh, you can go now.

18:03.201 --> 18:07.001
Everything's fine.
I was just making toast.

18:07.036 --> 18:08.465
Well, this is
interesting.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.301
You take the front.
I'll take the back.

18:10.336 --> 18:11.834
Ten-four.

18:17.633 --> 18:18.533
Oh, my God.

18:21.633 --> 18:22.699
Let me ask you something.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.617
Did you do this
to keep the toast inside?

18:24.652 --> 18:26.500
Did it become violent
when you burned it?

18:26.535 --> 18:27.532
Help us out here.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.767
Oh, you can't go in there.
Not yet.

18:29.802 --> 18:31.166
Sir, we have
to go in there.

18:31.201 --> 18:32.567
There's a missing
woman involved.

18:32.602 --> 18:34.433
Oh, she's not missing.

18:34.468 --> 18:35.699
She's right where I left her,

18:35.734 --> 18:38.217
on the couch,
soaked in kerosene.

18:38.252 --> 18:40.700
42 years I put up
with her yappin'.

18:40.735 --> 18:42.299
Then when she started in today,

18:42.334 --> 18:45.201
I... I said to myself,
"Today is the day.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.067
No more yappin'!"

18:50.001 --> 18:51.232
Should we pop it?

18:51.267 --> 18:53.234
Why don't you try
the knob first, asshole?

18:53.269 --> 18:54.567
Yeah, good idea.

18:55.234 --> 18:56.234
Thank you.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.199
Oh, Jesus. Nice.

19:21.234 --> 19:23.368
Yeah. I'm not gonna be
ordering the crispy beef

19:23.403 --> 19:25.934
from the Chinese place
anytime soon.

19:26.767 --> 19:27.732
What's goin' on?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.732
Well, this is the husband.

19:29.767 --> 19:31.800
This is the wood
he used to barricade the door

19:31.835 --> 19:34.368
to stop us
from rescuing his wife,

19:34.403 --> 19:36.765
who was inside,
on fire.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.368
And this is what gay couples
who insist on getting married

19:39.403 --> 19:40.600
have to look forward to.

19:43.101 --> 19:44.232
No more yappin'.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.167
Take it easy, pop.
Just watch your step.

19:46.202 --> 19:47.732
No more yappin'.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.550
Hey, I thought you quit
cigarettes.

19:49.585 --> 19:51.334
I know. This isn't
a cigarette.

19:51.369 --> 19:52.734
It's a flotation
device.

19:52.769 --> 19:53.867
Yeah. Gimme one.

19:55.368 --> 19:58.900
Hey. This guy tell you
what the argument was about?

19:58.935 --> 19:59.917
Socks.

19:59.952 --> 20:00.865
Socks.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.500
Wet socks on the bed.

20:05.234 --> 20:06.434
Wet socks?

20:08.834 --> 20:11.267
Marriage is a beast, boys.

20:11.302 --> 20:13.665
I'm at it almost 40 years...

20:13.700 --> 20:16.783
and the beast has claws
and nails and teeth

20:16.818 --> 20:19.867
that grow longer and sharper
every goddamn day.

20:19.902 --> 20:21.667
You wanna fight back,

20:21.702 --> 20:23.151
but you can't,

20:23.186 --> 20:24.565
'cause if you do,

20:24.600 --> 20:27.967
the beast'll snap your spine
in two pieces.

20:28.002 --> 20:29.418
So you give in,

20:29.453 --> 20:30.799
and then you sit

20:30.834 --> 20:33.232
in front of the tube,
sipping a beer,

20:33.267 --> 20:36.834
hoping and praying
that she'll fall asleep first.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.099
Or that you...

20:38.134 --> 20:41.633
die of a truly sudden
and massive heart attack.

20:44.301 --> 20:46.266
Well, l don't know
about you guys,

20:46.301 --> 20:48.967
but I can't wait to get home
to the little missus tonight.

20:49.002 --> 20:49.967
Yeah.

20:50.967 --> 20:54.034
Hey, probie gets his first grab.

20:54.069 --> 20:55.700
Married
or single guy?

20:55.735 --> 20:56.567
Single guy.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.633
Did him a favor, then.

21:01.900 --> 21:03.800
You allergic to them pants?

21:05.034 --> 21:06.468
No.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.267
It's actually starting
to sting now.

21:12.302 --> 21:13.401
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:13.436 --> 21:14.267
Ohh...

21:15.067 --> 21:16.032
Hey, hey.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.267
Talked to Mikey Brown
last night.

21:17.302 --> 21:18.699
- And?
- Two things.

21:18.734 --> 21:20.734
This guy Teffy hangs out
at a place called Hathaway's

21:20.769 --> 21:22.334
on the Lower East Side,
which makes sense.

21:22.369 --> 21:23.334
What's the other thing?

21:23.369 --> 21:24.201
Be careful.

21:27.101 --> 21:28.368
Be careful.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.001
Customer needs assistance
in produce.

21:35.036 --> 21:37.001
Customer needs assistance
in produce.

21:40.001 --> 21:42.001
Can I help you,
Mr. Gavin?

21:42.036 --> 21:43.166
Do I know you?

21:43.201 --> 21:44.665
I go to school
with Colleen.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.867
Oh. Well, do I look
like I need help?

21:46.902 --> 21:50.333
- Well, I was just--
- What?

21:50.368 --> 21:52.267
You seemed like you were
looking for something.

21:52.302 --> 21:54.167
Yeah, I was looking.
I was looking for this.

21:58.729 --> 22:01.021
All right? Anything else
you'd like to say?

22:02.600 --> 22:05.301
A lot of women like
the ones with wings better.

22:05.336 --> 22:07.468
Yeah, well,
Colleen happens to like these.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.567
Happy now?

22:24.401 --> 22:25.267
Tommy?

22:26.500 --> 22:27.699
- Tommy!
- Hey.

22:27.734 --> 22:29.401
- Hi.
- How you doing?

22:29.436 --> 22:30.366
Oh.

22:30.401 --> 22:32.867
It's for my mom.

22:32.902 --> 22:35.334
These aren't.

22:36.401 --> 22:37.366
Hi.

22:37.401 --> 22:40.401
Oh. Sorry, this
is... my friend Lisa.

22:40.436 --> 22:41.532
Hi.

22:41.567 --> 22:43.399
This is Jimmy's cousin.

22:43.434 --> 22:45.834
The firefighter.
I've heard so much about you.

22:45.869 --> 22:48.900
Yeah. There's two sides
to every story.

22:51.234 --> 22:52.667
So you guys,
what are you doing?

22:52.702 --> 22:53.934
Shopping.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.665
Yeah. Me, too.

22:56.700 --> 23:00.700
Um, you know, we...
We should get together,

23:00.735 --> 23:01.700
have dinner or something.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.500
Oh, yeah. We should.

23:05.533 --> 23:06.598
You know,

23:06.633 --> 23:08.468
we could do all three of us,
you know?

23:08.503 --> 23:09.434
Oh.

23:11.434 --> 23:12.932
Why would you wanna...?

23:12.967 --> 23:15.834
No, no. I'm just saying.
I thought that, uh--

23:15.869 --> 23:17.333
Whatever.

23:17.368 --> 23:19.450
I mean, the two of us,
three of us, I...

23:19.485 --> 23:21.498
That might be better.
You guys can catch up.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.301
The two of us. Yeah.
That's probably right. That's...

23:24.336 --> 23:26.301
Yeah.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.166
Um... call me.

23:29.201 --> 23:30.765
I'll call ya.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.434
All right.
Nice to meet you.

23:34.469 --> 23:35.368
You, too.

23:38.967 --> 23:41.167
Meat department,
pick up line three, please.

23:44.633 --> 23:45.598
Shit.

23:45.633 --> 23:47.734
Okay, I'll be sure
he gets it.

23:47.769 --> 23:48.699
How was lunch?

23:48.734 --> 23:50.032
A frickin' disaster.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.465
Call these banks right now.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.934
I went to pay for lunch,
both cards were declined.

23:53.969 --> 23:55.266
I looked like
a complete idiot

23:55.301 --> 23:57.101
in front of Ken Klein
and his whole team.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.802
How could they
be declined?

23:58.837 --> 24:00.433
I don't know!
Just call.

24:42.169 --> 24:43.368
Psst.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.368
What are you doing here?

25:13.167 --> 25:14.767
Hey, what are you doing?

25:14.802 --> 25:15.867
Getting some air.

25:16.867 --> 25:18.500
Dead guys
need air, huh?

25:20.734 --> 25:22.334
Just thinking about Sheila,
you know.

25:23.301 --> 25:24.333
Yeah.

25:24.368 --> 25:25.900
You haven't seen her,
have you?

25:26.934 --> 25:28.166
You know what, Jimmy,

25:28.201 --> 25:30.001
I-I-I actually ran into her
at the store today.

25:30.036 --> 25:31.299
- You did?
- Yeah.

25:31.334 --> 25:33.734
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

25:33.769 --> 25:35.134
How she's doing?

25:35.169 --> 25:36.465
She seemed good.

25:36.500 --> 25:39.532
She looked great,
but it was strange.

25:39.567 --> 25:44.301
She was with this kinda...
dykey-lookin' chick.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.001
Dykey-lookin'.
What are you talking about?

25:46.036 --> 25:47.433
And it was strange.

25:47.468 --> 25:53.934
When she introduced her to me,
she said, "This is...my friend."

25:53.969 --> 25:56.934
She took this weird pause
before she said "my friend."

25:56.969 --> 25:57.934
W-W-What kind of a pause?

25:57.969 --> 25:59.034
Like a weird, like,

25:59.069 --> 26:00.832
"This is--

26:00.867 --> 26:01.899
I'm thinking about it,

26:01.934 --> 26:03.334
and I don't know
what to say.

26:03.369 --> 26:04.818
my friend Lisa."

26:04.905 --> 26:07.287
And then the friend gave me
this strange look

26:07.323 --> 26:09.760
and then this really bizarre handshake,
like, way too long,

26:09.834 --> 26:12.567
and at the end when I was
saying goodbye to 'em,

26:12.602 --> 26:15.301
the dykey chick gave
this really bizarre stare.

26:15.336 --> 26:16.768
- My God.
- I know.

26:16.803 --> 26:18.201
It was troubling.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.765
Ahh.

26:20.800 --> 26:22.500
Sorry, pal.

26:25.101 --> 26:26.765
Hey, you know what?

26:26.800 --> 26:30.368
- It might be nothin', you know?
- Yeah.

26:30.403 --> 26:31.667
Yeah.

26:53.434 --> 26:54.633
How ya doin'?

26:54.668 --> 26:55.732
Hey.

26:55.767 --> 26:57.400
I'm Vinny Martin.

26:57.435 --> 26:59.034
How you doin'?

26:59.069 --> 26:59.900
Great.

27:01.301 --> 27:02.867
You lookin' for somebody?

27:02.902 --> 27:04.832
No.

27:04.867 --> 27:06.584
What'll
it be?

27:06.619 --> 27:07.893
Uh, draft. Beer.

27:07.928 --> 27:09.167
I'm good. Thanks.

27:12.267 --> 27:13.368
You a fireman?

27:14.934 --> 27:15.899
Yeah.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.633
Friend of Bobby Teff's?

27:18.668 --> 27:20.465
Uhh, comrade.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.450
Yeah. Good old Teflon.

27:23.485 --> 27:26.366
Yeah. Good old Teflon.

27:26.401 --> 27:28.867
- Nothing sticks to him, right?
- Right.

27:30.734 --> 27:33.101
Hey, were you in that fire
20 stories up

27:33.136 --> 27:35.668
when he swung out on a rope
from the roof

27:35.703 --> 27:38.201
and smashed a window
and grabbed a guy?

27:38.236 --> 27:39.832
That was Paddy Bar.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.067
Paddy Bar went over
that wall in a rope,

27:42.102 --> 27:44.034
and Paddy Brown
was up on the roof

27:44.069 --> 27:45.366
like a human anchor.

27:45.401 --> 27:48.301
I think you're wrong.
It was Teflon.

27:48.336 --> 27:50.099
You can ask him yourself.

27:50.134 --> 27:51.600
He usually comes in
about now.

27:53.900 --> 27:55.733
It was nice to meet you.

27:55.768 --> 27:57.567
I didn't catch your name.

27:57.602 --> 27:59.667
I didn't offer it.

28:04.567 --> 28:07.267
There's no smoking
in here, sir.

28:07.302 --> 28:08.368
Call the fire department.

28:10.667 --> 28:12.632
You...

28:12.667 --> 28:14.667
You should be happy
your wife's a lesbian.

28:14.702 --> 28:15.632
What?

28:15.667 --> 28:17.400
Yeah. I mean, think about it.

28:17.435 --> 28:18.951
I'm a guy.
You used to be a guy.

28:18.986 --> 28:20.433
We both know guys suck. Okay?

28:20.468 --> 28:22.667
What would you prefer,
her sucking on a couple of tits

28:22.702 --> 28:24.066
or hanging around

28:24.101 --> 28:26.201
with some horny, hungry,
hopped-up-on-Viagra shithead

28:26.236 --> 28:29.334
who's got two secret gym bags
full of DVD porn?

28:29.369 --> 28:31.134
True. True.

28:31.169 --> 28:32.865
By the way,

28:32.900 --> 28:34.301
where do you keep
those gym bags?

28:34.336 --> 28:36.765
Wouldn't you like to know.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.283
No, I'll tell you, brother,
I am pro-lesbian.

28:39.318 --> 28:41.767
I am a big supporter
of the lesbian community.

28:41.802 --> 28:42.968
Really?

28:43.003 --> 28:44.099
Yeah.

28:44.134 --> 28:45.800
I wish my daughter
was a lesbian.

28:45.835 --> 28:47.498
- Which one?
- Both.

28:47.533 --> 28:50.532
Why don't they have a pill
for that?

28:50.567 --> 28:54.533
Yeah. Sometimes I think gay guys
really got it made, you know?

28:54.568 --> 28:55.932
How is that?

28:55.967 --> 28:57.399
Well, think about it.
You're a guy.

28:57.434 --> 28:59.867
And you're with a guy who has
the same interests as you.

28:59.897 --> 29:02.325
That's, like, a win-win situation, man.
You know?

29:02.368 --> 29:04.767
First of all, you both like
to have a lot of sex.

29:04.802 --> 29:06.451
Second, if you're both
interested in sports,

29:06.486 --> 29:08.101
you can go to hockey games,
basketball games,

29:08.136 --> 29:10.032
football, baseball.

29:10.067 --> 29:12.567
It's all...
blowjobs and ballgames.

29:12.602 --> 29:14.500
Blowjobs and ballgames.

29:14.535 --> 29:15.532
Yeah.

29:15.567 --> 29:16.899
No, no, no.

29:16.934 --> 29:19.301
Any long-term relationship
has the same underlying engine,

29:19.336 --> 29:20.433
no matter

29:20.468 --> 29:22.334
what the sexual affiliation
might be.

29:22.369 --> 29:24.166
You fall in love.
You move in together.

29:24.201 --> 29:28.001
After a while, it's just
burning mutual resentment.

29:28.036 --> 29:29.066
You got ongoing arguments

29:29.101 --> 29:30.832
about the division
of household labor

29:30.867 --> 29:33.767
and secret, evil plans
to piss each other off.

29:35.368 --> 29:37.366
So, basically,

29:37.401 --> 29:40.067
even if you and I
were blowing each other,

29:40.102 --> 29:41.101
we're doomed.

29:42.334 --> 29:43.201
Yeah.

29:44.134 --> 29:45.567
Great.

29:50.401 --> 29:51.334
Teflon.

29:51.369 --> 29:52.267
Hey.

29:54.134 --> 29:55.350
Usual?

29:55.385 --> 29:56.476
Yes, sir.

29:56.511 --> 29:57.532
Larry.

29:57.567 --> 29:58.967
How are you,
man?

29:59.002 --> 30:00.368
Good to see you.

30:01.667 --> 30:02.632
Teflon?

30:02.667 --> 30:03.899
Who's askin'?

30:03.934 --> 30:06.867
Chief Jerry Reilly,
15 Battalion. Uptown.

30:06.902 --> 30:08.468
Oh. What can I do you for, Jer?

30:08.503 --> 30:10.166
In the future,

30:10.201 --> 30:12.633
why don't you think before
you shoot your mouth off, huh?

30:12.668 --> 30:14.633
I mean, those things
you said in the paper,

30:14.668 --> 30:16.565
way out of line.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.498
You got widows, kids, parents.

30:19.533 --> 30:21.867
They don't need
to read that garbage.

30:21.902 --> 30:23.101
A little respect, huh?

30:25.067 --> 30:26.366
Where's my drink, Dave?

30:26.401 --> 30:28.434
Hey, don't turn your back
on me, asshole.

30:28.469 --> 30:29.851
Look, I ain't
a chubby chaser, pal,

30:29.886 --> 30:31.234
so why don't you just run along?

30:31.269 --> 30:32.765
Listen, shithead--

30:32.800 --> 30:34.967
- Look, I told the truth.
- The truth.

30:35.002 --> 30:36.232
Screw the truth.

30:36.267 --> 30:38.633
There's orphans out there,
families, parents.

30:38.668 --> 30:40.465
Lovers.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.600
Look, just don't push me, huh?

30:42.635 --> 30:43.565
I swear to God--

30:43.600 --> 30:45.333
Look, this is the deal,
old man:

30:45.368 --> 30:47.468
unless you want your fat ass
kicked by a faggot--

30:47.503 --> 30:48.834
Oh, you're gonna kick
my ass.

30:51.167 --> 30:52.598
Come here.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.201
- Come here.
- Son of a bitch.

30:56.101 --> 30:58.632
Whoa!

30:58.667 --> 30:59.734
Easy, man.

31:06.633 --> 31:08.167
Leave him alone.

31:08.202 --> 31:09.167
Son of a--

31:10.201 --> 31:12.665
What are you doing?
Jesus Christ!

31:12.700 --> 31:15.667
Get him off of him!
Get him off of him!

31:15.702 --> 31:16.699
You take credit

31:16.734 --> 31:17.899
for somebody else's rescue
again,

31:17.934 --> 31:19.934
and I'll come down here
and kick your ass again!

31:19.969 --> 31:21.801
You son of a bitch, you!

31:21.836 --> 31:23.633
Christ! Call an ambulance!

31:23.668 --> 31:25.401
You son of a bitch!

31:29.468 --> 31:31.134
Ambulances en route...

31:31.169 --> 31:32.199
I'm back.

31:32.234 --> 31:33.834
Jesus. What the hell
took you so long?

31:33.869 --> 31:35.251
I had to go
to two stores.

31:35.286 --> 31:36.598
I got some
medicated spray

31:36.633 --> 31:40.434
and then this powder
and... and this stuff.

31:40.469 --> 31:41.651
Looked soothing.

31:41.686 --> 31:42.799
It's cooking spray.

31:42.834 --> 31:44.284
Yeah. I got the kind
with olive oil.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.734
Just give me the powder.
Come on.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.250
Well?

31:54.285 --> 31:55.665
No. Shit.

31:55.700 --> 31:58.734
- Aah. Gimme the other.
- Try this.

32:01.034 --> 32:02.999
Oh!

32:03.034 --> 32:04.767
- Oh, God. Yeah. That's good.
- Yeah.

32:04.802 --> 32:06.500
- That's really nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:06.535 --> 32:08.468
Told you. Told you.

32:18.001 --> 32:19.417
- One question.
- Okay.

32:19.452 --> 32:20.834
- Yeah?
- Is that cocaine?

32:20.869 --> 32:23.066
- No. No.
- No.

32:23.101 --> 32:26.201
Good, because if it was,
you're doing it wrong.

32:32.234 --> 32:33.101
Oh...

32:35.101 --> 32:37.633
Hey, you beat the shit out of
Bobby Teff last night?

32:37.668 --> 32:39.032
Who told you that?

32:39.067 --> 32:41.533
Bobby Clark from 68 Engine,
Johnny Walters from 340 Truck.

32:41.568 --> 32:42.765
Everybody's talking about it.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.066
Well, how did they find out?
What'd they say?

32:45.101 --> 32:47.101
Next time you wanna beat
the shit out of somebody,

32:47.136 --> 32:48.166
don't walk up to 'em

32:48.201 --> 32:50.532
and say your house number
and name first.

32:50.567 --> 32:53.201
I was thinking I just wanted
to go and talk to this guy.

32:53.236 --> 32:54.934
He wound up being
such a goddamn prick.

32:55.967 --> 32:57.532
So he told the cops it was me?

32:57.567 --> 33:00.234
Yeah, right before they put him
into a medically-induced coma.

33:00.269 --> 33:01.368
Not good.

33:01.403 --> 33:02.433
Jesus.

33:02.468 --> 33:04.401
I hear anything else,
I'll let you know.

33:04.436 --> 33:06.134
Otherwise, lay low.

33:06.169 --> 33:08.401
Yeah. Lay low.

33:19.034 --> 33:20.034
Hey.

33:20.069 --> 33:20.999
Hi.

33:21.034 --> 33:21.999
Want a hand?

33:22.034 --> 33:24.017
No. You're home early.

33:24.052 --> 33:25.966
Is that a problem?

33:26.001 --> 33:28.201
No. Why would that be a problem?

33:28.236 --> 33:29.465
Whatever.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.099
You find Connor's lunchbox?

33:31.134 --> 33:33.001
No. I actually forgot
about the lunchbox.

33:33.036 --> 33:34.232
Thanks, Tom.

33:34.267 --> 33:35.784
Yeah.
Well, you know, priorities.

33:35.819 --> 33:37.301
Family
possibly moving to California.

33:37.336 --> 33:38.598
Missing lunchbox.

33:38.633 --> 33:40.267
Look, I'm just exploring
our options.

33:40.302 --> 33:41.232
Really?

33:41.267 --> 33:42.700
- Our options.
- Mm-hmm.

33:42.735 --> 33:44.099
Mine and the kids'.

33:44.134 --> 33:46.099
Look, any judge with
half a brain is gonna require

33:46.134 --> 33:48.334
that you keep the kids within
a reasonable distance to me.

33:48.369 --> 33:50.134
So I think the idea
of moving to California

33:50.169 --> 33:52.068
is really just a pipe dream,
okay?

33:52.103 --> 33:53.967
Tommy, I need to get away
from this.

33:54.002 --> 33:55.034
From what?

33:55.069 --> 33:56.399
This.

33:56.434 --> 33:58.167
I mean,
every other house on the block

33:58.202 --> 33:59.598
has a dead hero dad.

33:59.633 --> 34:02.334
Every other kid at school
has lost a father or an uncle.

34:02.369 --> 34:03.399
And you know
what's worse

34:03.434 --> 34:05.101
than all the guys
that died that day?

34:05.136 --> 34:06.598
The rest of you left behind,

34:06.633 --> 34:09.134
walking around
like everything's fine,

34:09.168 --> 34:10.931
when you're dead
inside.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.766
Okay. You know what?
We've talked about this, okay.

34:12.802 --> 34:14.998
I can't fix
what happened to me, okay.

34:15.034 --> 34:17.234
I can't go and talk to somebody,
some shrink or something,

34:17.268 --> 34:18.998
or go to some spa
and sweat it out.

34:19.034 --> 34:21.632
You know, I just-- You knew
when we married my job was--

34:21.668 --> 34:23.934
Jesus Christ.
Tommy, I am sick of it.

34:23.969 --> 34:25.951
I want my kids
to grow up normal.

34:25.985 --> 34:27.899
Dogs and cats and picket fences.

34:27.934 --> 34:30.565
- You asked me for this, and I gave--
- For what?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.817
To stay home so you could
raise the kids hands-on.

34:32.851 --> 34:35.034
So I took two side jobs
besides the fire department,

34:35.069 --> 34:36.199
and what thanks do I get?

34:36.234 --> 34:37.984
You bitching and moaning
that I'm never home

34:38.018 --> 34:39.699
- and I never talk--
- And you never were home!

34:39.734 --> 34:41.800
I was too busy busting my ass
to pay the bills--

34:41.835 --> 34:43.867
Even when you were home,
you were never home!

34:43.902 --> 34:45.451
Even when we broke up, you--

34:45.485 --> 34:47.001
I raised those kids
on my own!

34:47.036 --> 34:48.533
It's bullshit.

34:50.967 --> 34:52.800
I am gonna do
whatever I have to

34:52.835 --> 34:54.134
to take care of these kids.

34:54.168 --> 34:55.732
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

34:55.766 --> 34:56.864
I'll fight you
in court.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.498
- Yeah? Well, you'll lose.
- Oh, really?

34:58.533 --> 35:00.550
Yeah. The court always sides
with the mother.

35:00.585 --> 35:02.567
- Let me tell you something.
- Don't you threaten me.

35:02.602 --> 35:04.832
If I wanna threaten you,
I will, okay?

35:04.867 --> 35:07.800
You start a shit storm
about my kids with me,

35:07.835 --> 35:08.999
you take 'em
anywhere you want.

35:09.034 --> 35:11.000
I will hunt you down,
and I will find you.

35:11.035 --> 35:12.967
Four corners of the earth,
I will find you,

35:13.002 --> 35:14.498
and I will take
those kids back.

35:14.533 --> 35:17.368
That's not a threat.
That's a goddamn promise, bitch.

35:51.900 --> 35:54.734
Thanks, guys.
See you tomorrow.

35:56.767 --> 35:59.700
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you Mike Silletti?

35:59.735 --> 36:00.665
Yeah.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.300
I'm, uh, Andrew.

36:02.335 --> 36:03.865
Andy. Andy Rykal?

36:03.900 --> 36:06.150
You're the guy from the fire.

36:06.185 --> 36:08.401
That's right. Dude, you rock.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.150
I brought this down here
for you.

36:11.185 --> 36:12.800
It's a bottle
of Dom Pérignon.

36:12.835 --> 36:14.068
That's...

36:14.103 --> 36:15.985
Thanks.

36:16.020 --> 36:17.832
Thank you.

36:17.867 --> 36:21.001
Dude, you've got
some hands on you.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.767
I mean, you're a strong
little guy,

36:24.802 --> 36:25.966
but your hands are so soft.

36:26.001 --> 36:28.967
I mean, my hands are...
My hands are a mess.

36:29.002 --> 36:30.434
I'm a welder.

36:31.700 --> 36:33.366
You saved my life.

36:33.401 --> 36:35.900
Oh, I'm just doing my job.

36:40.734 --> 36:42.250
I'm sorry.

36:42.285 --> 36:43.732
Sorry.

36:43.767 --> 36:46.032
My mom passed away last April,

36:46.067 --> 36:49.267
and I, uh... I've just been
thinking about her a lot.

36:54.967 --> 36:55.834
Sorry.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.633
Can I take you out to dinner?

37:00.034 --> 37:01.633
I-I can't tonight.

37:03.101 --> 37:04.899
Okay. Hey, yeah,
that's no problem.

37:04.934 --> 37:08.101
I... You're busy, and I'm sorry
I even bothered you.

37:08.136 --> 37:10.700
Maybe we can have lunch
or something.

37:10.735 --> 37:14.167
Oh, that's so cool. Thank you.

37:18.267 --> 37:19.834
Thanks.

37:21.900 --> 37:22.767
Catch you later, bro.

37:43.201 --> 37:44.732
Hello?

37:44.767 --> 37:46.533
Hey, it's me.

37:46.568 --> 37:47.498
Tommy?

37:47.533 --> 37:48.633
Yeah. How you doing?

37:48.668 --> 37:49.699
Roger there?

37:49.734 --> 37:52.167
Oh, Jesus, Tommy.
I'm in bed.

37:52.202 --> 37:53.232
What do you want?

37:53.267 --> 37:55.099
Look, I've been
thinking about this.

37:55.134 --> 37:57.533
I mean, can't we come
to some kind of a, you know,

37:57.568 --> 37:58.498
an agreement on this

37:58.533 --> 38:00.166
whole, you know,
California thing?

38:00.201 --> 38:02.834
I mean, God,
you're gonna hate California.

38:02.869 --> 38:06.334
It's all fake tits and assholes
and--

38:06.369 --> 38:07.433
You know, just--

38:07.468 --> 38:09.301
Why don't we just
pick a place around here?

38:09.336 --> 38:10.665
Like, you know,
Connecticut or Jersey,

38:10.700 --> 38:13.234
- and I'll help ya. I'll help--
- Are you drinking?

38:13.269 --> 38:14.934
No, I'm not drinking.
I'm driving.

38:14.969 --> 38:16.167
Well, you sound drunk.

38:16.798 --> 38:19.150
Yeah, yeah, I'm drunk.
I'm drinking, and I'm driving.

38:19.187 --> 38:20.659
You know, I just
smoked some crack,

38:20.700 --> 38:23.401
and I'm getting ready to roll
a nice big, fat joint--

38:24.134 --> 38:26.167
Uhh!

38:28.401 --> 38:31.234
You're lucky I'm not kidnapping
my own goddamn kids.

38:31.269 --> 38:32.468
Swear to God!

38:45.667 --> 38:47.368
Ahh...

38:49.734 --> 38:50.600
Shit.

38:53.267 --> 38:54.232
Hello?

38:54.267 --> 38:57.167
Hey...you. How you doing?

38:57.202 --> 38:58.667
Who is this?

38:59.767 --> 39:02.732
It's, ah, Tommy.
The firefighter.

39:02.767 --> 39:05.183
I was thinking maybe
you lost my number.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.565
No, no. I got your number
right here.

39:07.600 --> 39:12.034
I, uh... I just-- I've been
busy, and, you know, so...

39:12.069 --> 39:13.368
And I just got off work.

39:13.403 --> 39:14.665
I was kinda wired,

39:14.700 --> 39:17.468
so I thought, you know,
maybe I'd... give you a call.

39:17.503 --> 39:19.302
How you doing?

39:19.337 --> 39:21.066
Good. It's late.

39:21.101 --> 39:22.498
Yeah. All right.
You know, I'm sorry.

39:22.533 --> 39:24.817
I didn't-- You know,
I didn't think about that.

39:24.852 --> 39:27.101
I just-- You know what?
I'll call you tomorrow.

39:27.136 --> 39:28.598
- No.
- Yeah,

39:28.633 --> 39:31.633
we had a pretty horrible fire
tonight

39:31.668 --> 39:34.001
in a project building.

39:34.036 --> 39:36.299
It was... big, big fire.

39:36.334 --> 39:38.633
A couple kids trapped
in there, and...

39:38.668 --> 39:40.201
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

39:40.236 --> 39:41.699
Yeah. No, no, no. I'm fine.

39:41.734 --> 39:44.201
We pulled them out.
We saved everybody.

39:44.236 --> 39:45.800
Everybody's alive
and, uh...

39:45.835 --> 39:47.765
You know, it was just...

39:47.800 --> 39:50.201
it was just that it was
such an evil, evil thing

39:50.236 --> 39:51.465
that I...

39:51.500 --> 39:53.934
you know, wanted to think
of somethin' sweet,

39:53.969 --> 39:56.533
and, uh, I thought of you.

40:30.102 --> 40:31.999
I wanna go home.
