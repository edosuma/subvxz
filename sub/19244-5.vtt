[instrumental theme music playing]

01:13.406 --> 01:15.325
-[car door shuts]
-[engine starts]

01:25.293 --> 01:28.046
Hello. I'm friends with your grandson...

01:28.129 --> 01:29.422
Principal Novak,

01:29.506 --> 01:32.509
and I have something in Serbian
I need translated.

01:32.592 --> 01:36.304
-He said you might be able to help me.
-[heavy accent] I knows nothing about you.

01:36.387 --> 01:41.184
But I know about you.
And I brought you a reminder from home.

01:42.268 --> 01:45.104
-<i>Paczki.</i>
<i>-Paczki </i>is Polish.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.942
It's for peasants.
Leave outside for birds.

01:51.152 --> 01:51.986
Bring the box.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.697
I use the box.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.548
So I have these prints.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.801
[woman groans, speaks in Serbian]

02:14.884 --> 02:16.386
This no good.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.264
Put outside with Polish trash bread.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.100
I need to know what it says. Please?

02:22.183 --> 02:24.060
I'll bring you another empty box.

02:26.479 --> 02:30.233
It say, "Man eat man, to live."

02:30.316 --> 02:33.903
This is story of village of Pozica.

02:34.737 --> 02:39.284
When I little girl, they tell this story
to frighten childrens.

02:39.367 --> 02:44.164
Whole village turn to monster.
Man eat wife.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.207
Mother eat child.

02:46.916 --> 02:50.211
[sighs] Dead eat life.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.132
My father tell me if I bad...

02:54.924 --> 02:59.470
he send me to Pozica and they eat my face.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.891
So many different styles
of parenting, huh?

03:05.268 --> 03:08.938
I'll say. So, what does this one mean?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.858
"Without cure, man will die."

03:13.359 --> 03:14.903
Wait, there's a cure? What is it?

03:14.986 --> 03:19.741
Who knows.
Pictures come from very old book.

03:19.824 --> 03:23.786
-Cure in book, but book very rare.
-Do you have book?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.372
Do you have <i>Mona Lisa</i>?

03:26.956 --> 03:27.790
[door opens]

03:29.542 --> 03:31.127
Somebody threw donuts in the yard.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.381
What are you doing here?

03:35.465 --> 03:39.510
I felt very bad about the tension
between you and my wife the other day.

03:39.594 --> 03:43.932
So I brought your grandmother
a, uh... empty box.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.642
[Novak] I told you to stay away from me,

03:45.725 --> 03:49.145
and now here you are in my house
with my <i>baka</i>?

03:49.229 --> 03:50.563
I didn't eat any of them.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.276
-My grandmother!
-Andrei, he nice boy.

03:55.360 --> 03:59.030
I nice boy. But I leave now. [chuckles]

04:00.156 --> 04:02.325
God, that rhythm really gets in your head.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.167
And once I looked up Pozica, I found this.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.045
It's another image
from the same book our prints came from.

04:14.128 --> 04:16.047
I think this one shows someone
taking the cure.

04:16.631 --> 04:19.509
-Do you really think there's a cure?
-Mmm.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.927
Yes. The <i>baka </i>said so.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.637
-Chewbacca?
-No. The <i>baka.</i>

04:22.720 --> 04:26.140
<i>Baka </i>is "grandmother" in Serbian.
I'm learning so much!

04:26.849 --> 04:30.186
-You seem a little manic, honey.
-Well, I feel really manic.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.356
It's exciting, there could be a cure.
You could be eating pizza in a week.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.566
-Don't you want to be cured?
-Of course I do.

04:35.650 --> 04:40.697
Although, I do like the way that I feel.
I have endless energy,

04:40.780 --> 04:43.533
and I sleep two hours a night.
I get so much done.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.035
-You eat people.
-I know.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.871
It's just that
I'm so much more confident now.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.873
And our sex is incredible.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.042
And I don't know if this
has anything to do with it,

04:53.126 --> 04:55.044
but I can parallel park in one move now.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.256
-But you do want to be cured, right?
-Totally.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.341
Mostly.

05:01.009 --> 05:01.843
You eat people.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.264
-I know.
-So we need to find this book.

05:06.347 --> 05:08.516
Well, do we even know the name of it?

05:08.599 --> 05:11.602
It's some long Serbian name,
which according to a message board

05:11.686 --> 05:15.773
roughly translates to:
<i>Pozica: Never Fucking Go There.</i>

05:15.857 --> 05:17.942
There's this guy who claims to have it.
Name's Anton.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.278
He's really big in the paranormal world.

05:20.361 --> 05:22.405
This is the only picture
I could find of him.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.906
Oops! [chuckles]

05:23.990 --> 05:27.076
I was looking at a new carving knife
for Thanksgiving.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.246
240 bucks. Big investment.
Still thinking about it.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.331
Here he is.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.959
No last name, no phone number,
just an expired e-mail address.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.795
But I am gonna find you, Anton.

05:37.879 --> 05:42.425
And then I'm gonna read your book,
you blurry son of a bitch!

05:43.509 --> 05:45.720
We have that open house today.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.514
Maybe you should take the day off,
let me cover it.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.266
What? Huh?

05:50.933 --> 05:53.895
Well, it's just that everything's
been so intense lately

05:53.978 --> 05:55.897
and I'm worried about you.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.692
Maybe you should take some Joel time.
I can get Abby to help me.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.987
I guess it could give me some time
to search for this Anton guy.

06:03.071 --> 06:08.451
No. Don't do anything, okay? Just relax.
I'm dead, it can wait until tomorrow.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.660
Okay.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.747
I don't even know if I <i>can</i> relax.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.972
Hey! Oh, I finally found
that blooper reel from--

06:30.056 --> 06:32.266
-My mom's eating people.
<i>-...Spaceballs.</i>

06:32.350 --> 06:33.976
Not realizing your news was that.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.229
I went to the storage unit
to look at my dad's old bike,

06:36.312 --> 06:38.189
I found half a businessman in the freezer.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.109
Wow. That must have been intense.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.610
-Are you okay?
-It was pretty weird.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.195
I opened it expecting to find ice cream

06:44.278 --> 06:47.782
and instead there was a dead guy with
a look on his face like I surprised him.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.664
I'm sorry. But your mom is undead,
so that's kind of how they roll.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.501
I know. But she told me she was only
gonna be eating raw chicken and beef.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.420
They always make this big thing about
how we can be honest with each other

07:01.504 --> 07:03.172
and now I find out they're lying to me.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.800
Personally, I don't mind
when my mom lies to me.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.969
I just wish she did it better.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.554
Check this out.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.558
She claims she started a new spin class

07:13.641 --> 07:17.311
but really, she's having an affair
with a guy named Bob.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.604
-No way.
-Yeah.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.815
She accidentally linked her cell phone
to my computer

07:20.898 --> 07:22.650
so I can see all of her texts.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.527
Today, Bob copied and pasted
all of the lyrics

07:24.610 --> 07:26.696
to Stevie Wonder's "Part Time Lover."

07:26.779 --> 07:29.907
-Which seems lazy and on the nose.
-You should say something to her.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.159
It would only embarrass her.

07:31.242 --> 07:34.203
She's just trying to protect me
from knowing she's in a crappy marriage.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.746
Maybe your mom's trying to protect you

07:35.830 --> 07:38.291
from knowing
that she's a vicious killing machine.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.419
No offense, I think it's kinda cool.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.171
-[knock on door]
-Put it away, I'm coming in!

07:43.254 --> 07:45.173
Oh, Abby, I didn't know you were here.

07:45.256 --> 07:48.134
-Jesus. Mom.
-Oh, calm down, everybody does it.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.928
Even your own mother.
You guys want some waffles?

07:51.012 --> 07:53.598
Yeah, Abby, my mom masturbated,
then made waffles.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.184
-Does that make you hungry?
-[Abby] No. I should leave.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.895
I actually have to cover for my dad
at an open house, so...

07:58.978 --> 08:01.647
-Oh, what's wrong with Joel?
-Turn it off, Dan.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.358
-I think he's just taking the day off.
-Interesting.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.153
Really? Maybe I'm too close to it.
See you, guys.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.159
So you two were alone in your room
with the door closed.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.870
-Nothing happened.
-Of course nothing happened. You're you.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.664
Will you leave him alone, Dan?
He's just waiting for his moment.

08:18.748 --> 08:22.126
Honey, there's a casserole in the fridge.
I'm going to spin class again tonight.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.922
Good for you, Mom.
You have fun on that bike.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.007
No regrets.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.178
I'm gonna go next door,
talk to Joel about something.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.723
-Oh, God, not the ants again.
-No. Not the ants.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.870
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

09:02.625 --> 09:07.004
No, I'm good. I'm on baby duty.
But you can blow it in my face.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.759
Fuck it, just give it to me.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.887
So I got a cop question for you.

09:14.971 --> 09:18.099
Can you run a search on a guy
with just a first name

09:18.182 --> 09:20.142
and an expired email address?

09:20.226 --> 09:23.354
-This guy fucking Sheila?
-What? No. Why would you say that?

09:23.437 --> 09:25.690
Two reasons people ask a cop
to find somebody:

09:25.773 --> 09:29.151
wife-fucking, or because they found
a wallet and they want to return it.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.279
Which is usually an excuse
to find a wife-fucker.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.907
Uh, it's a work thing.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.868
I was at Starbucks and this guy said
he wanted to buy a house

09:37.952 --> 09:41.122
with a nice yard. Has two dogs.

09:41.205 --> 09:44.375
One's a little dog
who thinks he's a big dog--

09:44.458 --> 09:47.253
You know what?
I'm too high to lie right now.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.465
-Can you just do it?
-Yeah, I don't give a shit.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.592
Gentlemen.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.469
Whoa, hey! What the hell?
You can't just walk in my house.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.221
I knocked, no one answered.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.849
Probably couldn't hear me
over all this weed.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.018
Marijuana is nice, yes?

10:02.101 --> 10:06.272
I smoky with my black lover,
have a sexy time! [laughs]

10:09.108 --> 10:11.902
What reaction
are you hoping for right now?

10:11.986 --> 10:14.780
I thought toking the indo
made everything funnier.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.241
[mimics baby cry] Ooh!

10:17.325 --> 10:18.951
Baby's awake. Gotta go.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.705
Oh, come on, man,
don't leave me alone with...

10:23.289 --> 10:25.082
-out you.
-Let him go.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.542
We don't need him to have fun.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.213
-So, what do you want, Dan?
-You know, Abby was just over.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.215
Her and Eric have become good friends.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.968
-Yeah.
-And you and Rick are good friends.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.304
-Yeah.
-I don't have a lot of friends.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.307
Maybe you just need to meet people
with similar interests and--

10:41.390 --> 10:43.142
I know how friends work, Joel.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.894
Will you be my friend?

10:45.686 --> 10:46.812
Uh...

10:47.563 --> 10:48.564
No.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.525
Ouch. That hurt.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.070
I think you should reconsider.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.572
Uh...

10:57.323 --> 10:58.282
No.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.576
Too bad.

11:01.285 --> 11:05.915
Because if you're not gonna be
my friend, then you're... fucked.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.970
I killed the fly.
It was a worthy adversary. [chuckles]

11:20.054 --> 11:22.098
[sniffs] Are you baking cookies?

11:22.181 --> 11:25.017
No, it's vanilla extract
and essential oils

11:25.101 --> 11:26.602
baked in the oven at 350.

11:26.685 --> 11:29.939
It's an old realtor trick.
Makes the house smell like home.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.566
-Why not just bake cookies?
-Because they're messy.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.027
And I happen to believe Americans
get enough sugar in their diet.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.072
-But this is a lie.
-It's not a lie, it's a trick.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.198
What's the difference?

11:39.281 --> 11:42.743
One is a sin
and one pays for your Spotify.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.912
-What's your problem?
-I wanted an honest cookie, Mom.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.373
And you're giving me
a nose full of hypocrisy.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.169
Wha-- Like you're so perfect.
Who skipped school last week?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.130
-[slaps countertop]
-Fuck! That's what I should've said.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.799
Thanks for the sandwich.
That was really good.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.051
Making my balls buzz. Mmm!

11:59.135 --> 12:01.137
I've been wracking my brain
trying to figure out

12:01.220 --> 12:03.389
how that finger got in my backyard.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.183
My gardener got some new pruning shears--

12:06.267 --> 12:08.018
Ah, Joel...

12:08.102 --> 12:11.230
I know the finger belongs to Gary West.
I ran the print.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.274
I know that you and Sheila
worked with Gary.

12:13.357 --> 12:16.235
And I know that Lisa saw Gary
dancing with your wife at the club,

12:16.318 --> 12:18.154
grinding her pelvis into a fine mist.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.572
And then Gary disappeared.

12:19.655 --> 12:22.825
Fuck! This is such a drag.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.620
-[sighs]
-There is one thing I don't know.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.206
How could a pussy like you kill someone?

12:29.290 --> 12:32.001
I mean, I once saw you running
after an ice cream truck.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.880
-What do you want, Dan?
-I told you, I just wanna be friends.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.047
Fine, we're friends.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.467
Let's get Slurpees
and go to Magic Mountain.

12:39.550 --> 12:43.721
-So, are you gonna arrest me or what?
-Of course not, buddy.

12:43.804 --> 12:47.266
But, hey, now that we are friends,
I do need a favor.

12:47.349 --> 12:51.687
I'm gonna be out of town for a few days.
Kind of a hunting/alibi trip.

12:51.770 --> 12:53.189
-Alibi?
-Yeah.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.524
While I'm gone, I'm gonna need you
to kill someone for me.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.984
-What?
-I said,

12:57.067 --> 12:59.487
"While I'm gone, I'm gonna need you
to kill someone for me."

12:59.570 --> 13:02.740
I heard you, Dan. I just said "what?"
because I was startled.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.950
Oh. I'm sorry I startled you.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.994
Still gonna need you
to kill someone for me.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.165
Imagine coming home
after a long day of work

13:11.248 --> 13:13.876
to turn on your new
Wi-Fi enabled sound system,

13:13.959 --> 13:16.212
which you can listen to
from every room in the house.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.546
And... poof.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.258
-[soft piano music playing]
-You're in your own private sanctuary.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.094
-Sheila!
-[Sheila] I'm in the living room!

13:24.178 --> 13:25.471
We're fucked!

13:25.554 --> 13:26.889
With clients!

13:28.140 --> 13:31.018
[sighs] Hello. Pardon my language.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.355
We just have so many bids coming in.
I'm Joel Hammond.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.441
Have you been upstairs to check out
the multi-directional spray shower?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.860
-Not yet.
-Well, get up there!

13:41.237 --> 13:44.949
Master bath, upstairs,
right up there, there you go.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.033
Lovely.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.744
Dan found one of Gary's fingers
in our backyard.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.538
-Oh, my God.
-He thinks you and Gary

13:50.621 --> 13:52.873
were having an affair,
and I found out and killed him.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.460
So Dan assumes you killed Gary?
That's sexist.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.921
Yes, that's the big problem here, honey.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.507
Dan's devaluing
the important contribution women make.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.884
I see the problem, sweetheart.
It's just a little offensive.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.428
We all agree he's a terrible misogynist.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.431
He's also a crooked cop
who's blackmailing me to murder someone.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.475
So I don't know where to focus my anger.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.727
He wants you to kill somebody? Why?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.564
He's some drug dealer
who's murdered a bunch of people.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.524
Dan keeps arresting him
and he keeps getting off.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.693
So now Dan wants me
to be his personal killer.

14:20.776 --> 14:21.777
Shit!

14:21.861 --> 14:23.779
-Abby!
-Abba-dabba-doo!

14:26.866 --> 14:29.201
It's 4:01.
Open house is over. Let's go home.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.786
Hopefully, there'll be real cookies there.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.669
A couple came in today
with the cutest set of twins.

14:38.752 --> 14:40.796
-I love twins.
-A boy and a girl.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.756
That's the best kind.

14:44.967 --> 14:49.179
Honey, would you mind running out
and grabbing that sign for us?

14:49.263 --> 14:51.557
Oh, but then I'd miss
all the fun twin talk.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.642
[chuckling]

14:56.604 --> 14:57.813
Maybe we should just keep driving.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.524
Go home, get some clothes,
and just never come back.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.819
Well, that's crazy.
We can't just run away. Where would we go?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.322
[sighs] And we have so much equity
in our house.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.783
Yeah, I didn't think about the equity.
I'm a monster.

15:09.867 --> 15:13.162
I had a thought.
Maybe we can make this work for us.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.956
You want to murder someone for Dan?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.751
I will need to eat, and this is a bad guy.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.420
I don't want to be Dan's hired assassin.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.089
I'm just settling into being
a real estate broker who kills people.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.718
And the only thing I like about that job
is I get to be my own boss.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.764
-Hi.
-Thank you, sweetheart.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.350
-What's going on?
-Dinner.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.101
We were talking about
what to get for dinner.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.395
-Your dad wants chicken, I want beef.
-[scoffs]

15:38.479 --> 15:41.774
Oh, my goodness. However will it resolve?

15:41.857 --> 15:44.443
Honey, would you mind
getting that one for us too?

15:44.526 --> 15:45.402
Yes.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.156
Oh, I see, that wasn't a real question.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.497
Abby's been acting a little weird lately.
Have you noticed?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.332
No, but it's been a busy day.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.334
I went to the gym,
I misplaced my cell phone,

16:00.417 --> 16:03.212
oh, and then Dan asked me
to murder a murderer.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.631
Okay, I get it. You don't want to do this.

16:05.714 --> 16:09.468
-Thank you.
-Which is why I'm happy to do this myself.

16:09.551 --> 16:13.681
You have been doing so well
with your research and your bookstores.

16:13.764 --> 16:17.267
And I've been doing well sneaking up
on people and killing them.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.479
We both have our strengths. What a team.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.358
Wow. Dan called me a pussy today.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.402
This feels... of a piece.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.654
That wasn't what I was saying.

16:28.737 --> 16:31.073
I was just saying I know
you don't wanna go with me

16:31.156 --> 16:35.744
when I go to... shop for dinner,
so I'll go by myself.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.871
No. It's okay.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.624
I don't like this shopping excursion
you're proposing,

16:40.708 --> 16:43.419
but I can certainly handle it,
so I will help you.

16:43.502 --> 16:48.048
Because what kind of man would I be
if I sent you to the grocery store alone?

16:48.132 --> 16:51.510
Well, I love you being
my shopping partner, so thank you.

16:52.094 --> 16:53.095
[Abby] Wow.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.764
Your wedding vows
must have been awesome.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.396
[footsteps]

17:02.479 --> 17:03.605
I can't do it anymore.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.442
I can't just not say anything
to my parents

17:06.525 --> 17:08.402
when I know they're lying
right to my face.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.696
Hello.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.033
I just want to say, "Stop lying!
I know that 'beef' you're shopping for

17:14.116 --> 17:15.576
probably once wore underwear."

17:15.659 --> 17:18.871
Am I just supposed to pretend forever
I don't know they're killing people?

17:18.954 --> 17:22.166
It's tough. On one hand, they love you
and are trying to protect you,

17:22.249 --> 17:23.959
and on the other hand...

17:25.085 --> 17:28.338
-you smell like coconuts.
-I just think that if you love someone,

17:28.422 --> 17:31.133
you have to be completely
and totally honest with them.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.509
Like, no matter what.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.264
-Uh-huh.
-I'm just gonna tell them I know because--

17:38.390 --> 17:40.976
Oh, Eric, uh, I'm-- I'm sorry...

17:41.060 --> 17:42.478
-It's okay.
-No, it's just--

17:42.561 --> 17:45.689
I'm going through a lot right now and
I can't really get involved with anyone--

17:45.773 --> 17:47.816
Abby, I get it.
You're not interested in me.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.359
-That's not what--
-No, it's fine.

17:49.443 --> 17:52.488
I was just trying to prove my point.
Because you're not into me.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.782
But you just lied to protect me
so I wouldn't get hurt,

17:54.865 --> 17:56.366
like your parents are doing to you.

17:56.450 --> 17:59.870
And I'm not hurt, because this was all
a rhetorical exercise to make a point.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.289
Okay.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.876
No, I see what you're saying about, um...

18:05.959 --> 18:07.503
Um, yeah. Cool.

18:08.504 --> 18:13.717
Hey, sorry if I embarrassed you by, like,
thinking you actually wanted to kiss me.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.094
Oh, me, embarrassed? Please.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.679
You're looking at the guy

18:17.763 --> 18:19.264

18:19.765 --> 18:22.684
Luckily, it fit the character
so it looked like a strong acting choice.

18:22.768 --> 18:25.521
-Right. Of course. Bye, Eric.
-Bye-bye now!

at his apartment tonight after 11.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.372
Oh, I hate eating so late.

18:43.455 --> 18:46.125
Yeah. There's a lot about this
that isn't ideal.

18:46.208 --> 18:50.129

from his apartment back to our freezer?

-Do we bring a weapon?

19:27.541 --> 19:28.667
I'm the weapon.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.836
Somebody's cocky.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.296
I have the element of surprise.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.173
No one expects a tiny realtor lady

19:34.256 --> 19:37.050
to jump on their back
and rip out their throat.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.761
Besides, there's something I enjoy
about the kill.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.931
-Really?
-Yeah. It's like a rush.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.267
It feels like I'm giving my body
something it needs

19:45.350 --> 19:47.436
in an intense and powerful way.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.064
-Is it sexual?
-It's not not sexual.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.025

20:28.268 --> 20:31.188
Were you aware that your building
was recently purchased

by Southern California's

20:34.733 --> 20:36.068
Oh, my God!

20:36.151 --> 20:37.986
-The fuck I care?
-Great question.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.365
The fuck you care is we've been tasked
by that very developer

20:41.448 --> 20:45.118
to offer you a large cash settlement
to forgo your current lease.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.370
Oh, my God!

She got so much cash,
she don't even talk to our family no more.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.842
Yeah. I want that.

21:04.846 --> 21:05.806

-Champagne flutes if you have 'em.
-Flutes?

21:14.189 --> 21:15.357
I think I may.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.993
Is it, uh, just the three of us here?

21:26.076 --> 21:28.537
-No. I got a snake in my room.
-That's neat.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.415
I may not have flutes. I thought I did.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.083
Oh, keep looking.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.501
[groaning]

23:43.964 --> 23:45.465
I'm sorry.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.509
I couldn't do it.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.554
Honey, it's okay. Are you all right?

23:51.346 --> 23:52.848
I'm fine. I just...

23:53.640 --> 23:54.474
I'm fine.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.686
Well, he saw our faces,
so we're gonna have to go after him.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.316
-I may have bit him.
-Uh-huh.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.319
I mean, I don't know if I did.
His chains were really thick.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.488
But if I did bite him,
will he become like me?

24:08.572 --> 24:11.032
We don't know how this spreads.
I never got bitten.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.743
I didn't bite him.
I didn't taste any blood.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.787
Do I have skin in my teeth?

24:15.871 --> 24:18.498
I brought a knife in case
something went wrong, and it did.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.333
I had him, I just...

24:21.710 --> 24:23.086
I couldn't do it.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.213
Oh, honey, it's okay.

24:25.297 --> 24:30.010
No, it's not.
Sometimes I feel like you're Batman and--

24:30.093 --> 24:31.845
Robin is important.

24:31.928 --> 24:35.807
I was gonna say
I feel like you're Batman <i>and </i>Robin,

24:35.891 --> 24:37.851
and I'm... Alfred.

24:38.602 --> 24:39.686
Oh.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.690
We're not gonna find him. Let's go home.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.860
-What are we gonna tell Dan?
-I don't know. [sighs]

24:46.943 --> 24:50.906
We have a couple of days till he gets back
from his hunting/alibi trip.

24:51.781 --> 24:56.411
It's all going to be fine.
I'm almost sure I didn't bite him.

24:56.494 --> 24:59.956
-We're gonna be fine.
-Totally.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.209
Mostly.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.468
Honey, is my briefcase in the kitchen?

25:11.551 --> 25:12.886
Yeah, it's right...

25:23.438 --> 25:24.481
here.

25:24.564 --> 25:27.359
I hope we didn't wake you last night
when we got home.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.444
The movie ran longer than we thought.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.616
Is everything okay, Abby?
Is there something you wanna talk about?

25:37.786 --> 25:40.080
No. Everything's great.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.623
Great.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.715
-Here.
-Well, thank you.

25:50.799 --> 25:51.841
No problem.

26:04.646 --> 26:05.855
Housekeeping.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.984
Housekeeping, I clean?
