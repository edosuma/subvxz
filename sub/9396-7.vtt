<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:04.070 --> 00:06.868
-No one else needs to know.
-You mean Karen.

00:06.939 --> 00:09.932
You know, I was thinking
about this whole friends-with-benefits.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.069
Felix with Brooke. FWB.

00:12.145 --> 00:15.308
-How many other songs have you written?
-I don't know. A few.

00:15.382 --> 00:19.682
-AII right, well, you're gonna open.
-No, I am not. I get major stage fright.

00:19.753 --> 00:22.119
You're gonna have to get out for this one.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.453
-Are you gonna tell me what it was?
-Maybe.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.653
-You're great.
-Yeah, I know. When do I play?

00:28.728 --> 00:32.561
You're okay but we had
a lot of really good people show up today.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.725
So, we'll call you.

00:34.801 --> 00:37.770
Look, I know it's kind of short notice,
so, bring Lucas along...

00:37.837 --> 00:40.635
if you can't find a sitter.
I'd love to meet the little guy.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.505
My brother owns the dealership.
I'm just helping out.

00:43.576 --> 00:46.773
-I'm actually a mechanic.
-I like mechanics.

00:49.382 --> 00:53.682
I've got a good sense about people.
You're young, but you...

00:54.220 --> 00:56.245
might be worth the risk.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.523
Here's your shot, kid.

01:42.502 --> 01:44.936
<i>Oliver Wendell Holmes once said.:</i>

01:45.371 --> 01:48.465
<i>''Many people die</i>
<i>with their music still in them.</i>

01:48.975 --> 01:52.877
<i>''Too often it is because</i>
<i>they are always getting ready to live.</i>

01:54.314 --> 01:58.045
<i>''Before they know it, time runs out. ''</i>

02:04.491 --> 02:07.983
You're still here.
I thought we had an understanding.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.862
Once the hooking-up is over, you go home.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.763
Damn. You can make a guy feel used.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.197
I'm sorry.

02:16.269 --> 02:20.000
We could just cancel
our little arrangement and save your pride.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.041
No. Being used is fine.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.234
Yeah, that's what I thought.

02:24.310 --> 02:28.212
So why don't you get your used butt
up out of my bed, pool boy?

02:28.281 --> 02:31.478
I have a big day ahead of me
and you're in my way.

02:42.262 --> 02:43.286
Hi.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.465
I think you've got the wrong store.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.331
Forever 21 is just down the street there.

02:50.069 --> 02:52.503
That's Jeff Buckley. You heard of him?

02:52.572 --> 02:54.335
Who hasn't heard of Jeff Buckley?

02:54.407 --> 02:57.376
That man is the reason that I became
a musician. You know why?

02:57.443 --> 02:59.411
Because he never sold out.

02:59.479 --> 03:02.505
Why stop there?
Didn't he also drown in a river?

03:02.582 --> 03:07.110
Listen, if you want me to play your show,
you're gonna have to ask nicely.

03:08.421 --> 03:10.412
-I don't need this.
-Sure you do.

03:10.490 --> 03:13.789
Why else would you be here
at 8:00 a.m. on a school day?

03:15.828 --> 03:19.025
Okay, here's the deal. The turnout
for auditions was kind of low...

03:19.098 --> 03:21.760
-so, if you want--
-Here's my rider.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.769
-What is this?
-It's like a list of artist's demands.

03:25.838 --> 03:27.738
I know what a rider is.

03:29.008 --> 03:32.671
''Chamomile tea,
one small vegetarian pizza.

03:32.745 --> 03:35.543
''One box Magnum
extra-large size condoms.''

03:35.615 --> 03:38.311
-Are you kidding?
-The regular ones cut off the circulation.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.511
We got a deal here or what?

03:42.889 --> 03:44.550
You go on at 9:00.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.821
Have fun at school.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.859
Come on, pony up, people.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.666
There's kids in this world
a lot more miserable than you.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.606
-Thank you. God bless.
-Look at this.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.269
One over-ripe cantaloupe,
two number-3 pencils?

04:05.345 --> 04:07.404
What kind of rider is this?

04:07.480 --> 04:10.938
God bless you. Change for the needy?

04:11.517 --> 04:14.645
Brooke, I had no idea
you were so charitable. What's the cause?

04:14.721 --> 04:18.122
Just needy people. God bless you.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.625
Brooke, I recognize the photo.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.959
It's from an ad for cramp medicine.

04:24.097 --> 04:28.193
Wow. Homeless and PMSing. Poor girl.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.565
-Brooke!
-Brooke!

04:29.636 --> 04:31.695
AII right, the money's for me.

04:31.771 --> 04:32.760
I'm the needy one...

04:32.839 --> 04:35.239
as in, I need some things
for your club opening.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.477
-Do you realize how wrong that is?
-Sort of.

04:39.545 --> 04:42.036
But, I mean, what am I supposed
to do for money?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.879
-Try getting a job!
-Right, doing what?

04:44.951 --> 04:48.216
Anything. A number of things.
What are your skills?

04:48.288 --> 04:51.451
I don't know. I'm good with guys.
Dates, dating.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.384
-Yeah, and?
-Sex, but....

04:54.460 --> 04:56.655
That would make you a hooker.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.828
Thank you.

05:00.099 --> 05:02.590
I'll take you shopping on a budget.

05:06.839 --> 05:08.864
-Hey, Felix.
-Mighty Mouth.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.043
-You going to the club opening tomorrow?
-That's the plan.

05:12.111 --> 05:13.635
You taking Brooke?

05:13.713 --> 05:16.739
No, I like to alternate my cheerleaders.
This week, Theresa.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.943
But I thought
you and Brooke were together.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.009
It doesn't really work like that.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.885
So, she's not gonna be there
with anybody?

05:24.023 --> 05:25.752
Not that I know of.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.495
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you!

05:37.236 --> 05:39.363
You know,
I had a great time the other night.

05:39.439 --> 05:42.101
Me too. Listen, can we talk?

05:43.476 --> 05:46.775
-That doesn't sound good.
-It's not like that. It's just...

05:46.846 --> 05:49.713
I love spending time with you,
you know that.

05:49.782 --> 05:52.649
But being dropped into a new place
is hard enough...

05:52.719 --> 05:55.654
without jumping
into a new relationship, too.

05:56.656 --> 05:58.453
You must really hate me.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.425
Stop it.
I'm just saying let's not rush things.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.928
Let's hang out, see where it goes.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.655
-Did Felix say something?
-No, it's not that. Promise.

06:08.968 --> 06:12.369
-Okay. Friends.
-With potential.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.531
Hi.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.599
Ready for your big debut, rock star?

06:17.677 --> 06:19.645
-Please don't remind me.
-She's ready.

06:19.712 --> 06:23.079
Didn't you once tell me
there's such a thing as over-preparation?

06:23.149 --> 06:27.245
Yeah, for a math midterm.
This is like avoiding public humiliation.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.515
Hales, you're gonna do great.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.579
Saturday night, three bands.
Bring your friends.

06:55.848 --> 06:57.509
Adrian Tomine fan?

06:58.851 --> 07:02.582
-You know his stuff?
-Yeah. I love <i>Optic Nerve.</i>

07:02.855 --> 07:05.949
Really? A fellow comic book geek.

07:06.492 --> 07:08.357
Well, closeted.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.127
-I'm Anna.
-I'm Peyton.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.459
You're Felix's sister, right?

07:14.066 --> 07:16.591
On the days that I claim him, yeah.

07:18.204 --> 07:21.298
-So how's Tree Hill treating you?
-Okay.

07:22.975 --> 07:26.172
But I think someone forgot to give me
the secret password.

07:26.245 --> 07:29.942
Yeah, people in this town tend to stick
to their own crowd.

07:33.719 --> 07:35.414
At least the guys are cute.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.193
Okay. Tree Hill rule number one:

07:42.795 --> 07:46.629
People in this town tend to have
really complicated histories.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.732
-Dan. How you feeling?
-Good.

07:56.843 --> 08:00.301
-Good. Deb's not in till 4:00.
-I came to see you.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.173
-Okay.
-To apologize.

08:06.486 --> 08:10.616
I was hoping you'd forgive me
for the things I've done to hurt you.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.155
Can I be honest with you, Dan?

08:16.162 --> 08:17.993
You're creeping everybody out.

08:18.064 --> 08:21.124
This phoenix bird thing,
this sensitive thing that you're pulling.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.929
No one's buying it.

08:23.469 --> 08:26.700
I'm sorry you feel that way.
But I understand.

08:28.207 --> 08:31.506
By the way, Deb said Keith
hasn't been hanging around here lately.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.943
I hope it's not because of what happened.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.311
You should know
that I've chosen to forgive him.

08:36.381 --> 08:37.644
For what?

08:38.650 --> 08:40.515
For sleeping with Deb.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.088
I'm sorry, Karen.
I really thought that you knew.

09:09.181 --> 09:12.275
-Speak.
<i>-Hey, it's Keith.</i>

09:12.351 --> 09:15.878
Sorry, I know a lot of Keiths.
Could you be more specific?

09:15.955 --> 09:18.253
It's the Keith you kissed the other night.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.054
No, you've got to give me more than that.

09:21.861 --> 09:25.388
In a convertible,
on a car ramp at Scott Motors.

09:26.098 --> 09:29.966
Okay, that narrows it down
to about a half a dozen or so.

09:31.604 --> 09:33.071
You're funny.

09:33.906 --> 09:37.967
Look, I know it's last minute,
but there's a club opening tonight.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.266
You want to go?

09:40.246 --> 09:43.147
I don't know. I think I already have a date.

09:43.816 --> 09:46.808
Besides, don't you know
about the Wednesday rule?

09:46.886 --> 09:48.080
''The Wednesday rule''?

09:48.154 --> 09:51.715
A girl can't accept a weekend date
if the offer comes after Wednesday.

09:51.791 --> 09:52.985
It's a rule.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.993
<i>Yeah, you know who follows those rules?</i>

09:55.061 --> 09:56.995
Girls who sit at home on weekends.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.234
<i>Well, you may be in luck.</i>

10:02.301 --> 10:05.099
I've never been a big fan of rules. 8:00?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.741
Does this melon look overly ripe to you?

10:09.809 --> 10:12.369
Sorry, it's not my area of expertise.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.675
So, what's going on
with you and Felix now?

10:14.747 --> 10:17.773
I don't know. I mean, the whole point
of friends-with-benefits...

10:17.850 --> 10:20.284
-is there's no strings attached, right?
-Right.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.345
Lately he's been getting
really stringy on me.

10:23.923 --> 10:26.915
And why are we looking
for overly ripe fruit again?

10:26.993 --> 10:28.460
Chris' rider.

10:28.527 --> 10:32.122
Basically, I have to get him everything
on this list or he won't perform.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.222
Wait a second.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.735
He makes a list and you have to do
everything on it to get what you want?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.064
Exactly.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.338
Interesting.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.112
Just in time.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.308
Just let me finish here,
then we can go upstairs.

10:51.384 --> 10:55.286
You can go upstairs and finish yourself.
I just came by to give you this.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.788
It's a rider. A list of artist's demands.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.655
-Peyton told me about it.
-What's it for?

11:00.726 --> 11:04.162
Yesterday you seemed a little sketchy
on the terms of our agreement...

11:04.230 --> 11:06.824
so I figured I'd clear it up for you.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.198
With a bunch of rules?

11:09.502 --> 11:12.062
And you better follow them
if you ever want me to...

11:12.138 --> 11:14.698
perform at your venue again.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.405
''No sleeping over. No sleeping late.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.312
''No non-sexual bathing.''
Is this necessary?

11:24.550 --> 11:27.451
-You've been getting a little needy.
-Needy?

11:28.888 --> 11:32.324
Please, I have a date tonight.
You are okay with that?

11:33.626 --> 11:34.854
Item 12.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.888
''No asking if it's okay to date
other people.''

11:41.000 --> 11:42.524
So we're clear?

11:43.269 --> 11:44.497
Crystal.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.281
That's an odd sight.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.880
What, you thought I'd be blind?

12:03.956 --> 12:06.481
No, I just didn't think you could read.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.552
<i>500 Things a Person Should See</i>
<i>Before They Die.</i>

12:12.364 --> 12:14.161
I've seen 12 of them.

12:14.967 --> 12:18.334
-You gonna do something about that?
-That's the plan.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.369
At least until practice starts.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.710
I always wanted to dive
with the manta rays in Tobago.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.743
So, Coach, I turned down High Flyers.

12:35.221 --> 12:38.884
Is there a reason you turned them down,
or should I even ask?

12:38.958 --> 12:40.050
Well, it's just....

12:40.359 --> 12:42.554
Haley's pursuing this whole music thing.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.726
She's done a lot for me, Coach.
It's her turn now.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.001
And me going to camp would just
stand in the way of that.

12:51.937 --> 12:56.033
Sometimes marriage is about sacrifice.

12:59.278 --> 13:03.271
Maybe you're not taking a step forward
as a basketball player...

13:05.151 --> 13:08.086
but you're taking two steps forward
as a man.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.449
Thanks, Coach.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.930
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:25.871 --> 13:29.363
I just dropped by to wish you
good luck tonight.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.273
Thanks. You're still coming, right?

13:32.344 --> 13:34.471
-Of course, yeah.
-Good.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.379
I also wanted to talk to you
about something else.

13:39.451 --> 13:40.543
Okay.

13:43.189 --> 13:46.022
I know that you and I were never an item...

13:47.593 --> 13:51.461
but I thought you should know I'd like to...

13:52.932 --> 13:55.332
bring a date to the club tonight.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.892
Anyone I know?

13:58.304 --> 14:01.603
Her name's Jules.
I met her at the dealership.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.508
Is that it?

14:06.812 --> 14:09.178
-Yeah.
-Good.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.276
-I look forward to meeting her.
-Okay.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.587
-Beware of strangers bearing gifts.
-What is that, Andy?

14:16.655 --> 14:19.715
Look, every cool club needs
its own T-shirt, right?

14:19.792 --> 14:21.953
-So, there you go.
-That's sweet.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.860
Lucas! That reminds me,
I got him one, too.

14:30.169 --> 14:33.798
Keith, this is Andy. My professor.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.739
-Nice to meet you, Keith.
-Yeah. You, too.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.852
But I want it so bad.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.684
No, it's not in the budget.
Besides, if you get the purse...

14:50.756 --> 14:52.917
then you can't afford the outfit
for the opening.

14:52.992 --> 14:56.291
Screw the opening.
I'll stay at home with the purse.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.860
What's going on? Are you all right?

14:58.931 --> 15:01.991
-Yeah, I just feel a little light-headed.
-Why?

15:02.701 --> 15:04.999
-I sold some stuff.
-What stuff?

15:06.038 --> 15:08.097
Some blood.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.342
Blood? You sold blood? Brooke,
do you really think that's a good idea?

15:12.411 --> 15:14.208
You actually don't look very well.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.111
-You're pasty.
-I'm discount shopping.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.308
I'm gonna have to get used
to looking like crap.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.012
Besides, I needed some extra money
for the dress.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.781
Which was only $36.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.117
-Shoes.
-$18.

15:24.189 --> 15:26.089
-Eyeliner to go with the shoes.
-$7.50.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.319
Which is what, $61.50 with tax?

15:28.394 --> 15:30.521
I mean, please, you have plenty
left over for--

15:30.596 --> 15:33.121
AIcohol. We'll stop at a liquor store
on the way home.

15:33.198 --> 15:36.463
I really don't think you should be drinking
after you just gave blood.

15:36.535 --> 15:39.163
No, the woman told me
to rehydrate myself.

15:39.238 --> 15:41.706
Besides, if I'm gonna be seen
in these shoes...

15:41.774 --> 15:44.004
I'm gonna need a drink or two.

15:47.012 --> 15:50.607
Okay, we've got the DJ downstairs.
The bar is stocked.

15:50.983 --> 15:52.177
Wristbands?

15:52.251 --> 15:54.481
They are down in front with Junk
right now.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.491
That's it. It's out of our hands.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.417
-No, you forgot something.
-What?

16:03.228 --> 16:05.093
To take a deep breath.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.762
Just for a second. Look around.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.767
-You guys did this. And it's great.
-Yeah.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.405
Oh, God, what if I didn't
make up enough flyers?

16:16.475 --> 16:17.874
What if I didn't put up enough?

16:17.943 --> 16:21.242
-What if nobody shows up outside, and--
-Come here.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.682
I don't think that
that's gonna be a problem.

16:51.377 --> 16:53.777
Okay, my thighs are itching...

16:53.846 --> 16:57.247
and not so much in a good way.
I think I'm allergic to polyester.

16:57.316 --> 16:59.307
But it's fine. I've had a few drinks.

16:59.385 --> 17:02.377
I should have a few drinks, because....
Do you see all these people?

17:02.454 --> 17:04.251
You're gonna be fine!

17:04.690 --> 17:07.214
Hey, Ms. Roe. The club looks great.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.088
Let's see the wrist, Brooke.

17:13.499 --> 17:16.023
No alcohol. Are we clear?

17:16.667 --> 17:19.898
-Yes.
-Good. Now go have some fun.

17:23.442 --> 17:27.344
This is definitely the first time I've felt
like the oldest person in the bar.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.903
Second-oldest.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.810
Andy, this is Peyton.
Peyton this is my friend, Andy.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.547
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.453
I'll try to keep out of your hair.

17:38.524 --> 17:41.288
You didn't happen to bring little Lucas
tonight, did you?

17:41.360 --> 17:44.193
Yeah, he's wandering around here
somewhere.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.595
Great. I can't wait to meet him.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.470
-''Little Lucas''?
-His words, not mine.

17:53.338 --> 17:55.704
So, what's the story with you and your...

17:56.275 --> 17:57.264
friend?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.572
You know, I'm not sure how to describe it.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.741
-Put it this way, are you two getting....
-Peyton.

18:05.717 --> 18:10.086
Because if you were,
I'd describe it as pretty lucky.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.121
He's a fox.

18:17.362 --> 18:20.559
So, how was your other date
with the cancellation?

18:20.799 --> 18:22.824
-Why? You wanna ask him out?
-No.

18:22.901 --> 18:25.028
I just didn't know
you were seeing other people.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.833
If you're one of them, I'd shut up.

18:26.905 --> 18:29.567
Yeah, you know, that's a good point.

18:29.641 --> 18:32.166
-So, how's it going, Junk?
-AII good.

18:32.244 --> 18:35.372
Here you are. Mr. Scott, plus one.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.143
VIP, over-21 wristbands....

18:38.617 --> 18:41.848
-I didn't know you were so hip, Keith.
-Yeah, well, neither did I.

18:45.624 --> 18:49.458
Karen never said anything
about drinking outside of the club.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.731
Hey, Brooke. I like your dress.

18:58.770 --> 19:02.763
So, I was wondering if you maybe wanted
to do something sometime?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.938
Hey, you wanna catch a movie sometime?

19:08.614 --> 19:10.241
What's up, Mouth?

19:13.585 --> 19:16.679
-Hey, Theresa. Nice dress.
-Thanks.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.715
Why does it look so familiar?

19:19.791 --> 19:22.225
I remember: because it used to be mine.

19:22.294 --> 19:25.161
Brooke, I asked you before I bought it.
You said it was okay.

19:25.230 --> 19:28.393
Yeah, well, that was before I knew
how your ass would look in it.

19:28.534 --> 19:31.731
Theresa, why don't you go up?
I'll be right there.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.001
I'd have to check the list,
but I'm pretty sure...

19:37.075 --> 19:39.509
acting like a jealous girlfriend
is against the rules.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.170
I'm not jealous.

19:41.713 --> 19:45.877
I just figured you would have gone
for someone with a little more class.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.351
Why? I went for you, didn't I?

20:04.803 --> 20:06.293
-Hey.
-Hey!

20:08.674 --> 20:10.801
-I can't do it.
-What?

20:11.243 --> 20:13.211
-I can't do it.
-Do what?

20:13.679 --> 20:16.978
Play. At all. I have to back out.

20:17.115 --> 20:18.946
And you're telling me this now?

20:19.017 --> 20:22.009
I'm sorry, it's just all these people, and....

20:22.087 --> 20:24.920
I told you this might happen, okay?
So, please, just....

20:24.990 --> 20:26.321
Don't hate me. I'm sorry.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.087
Haley, you can't do this.
Your name's already on the poster.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.152
There are people here
expecting you to play.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.095
So what?
Who's gonna know the difference?

20:33.165 --> 20:36.066
You've already got two acts
and a DJ, right?

20:38.337 --> 20:40.066
I'll figure it out.

20:40.839 --> 20:41.897
Okay.

20:41.974 --> 20:45.273
But you're gonna have to get
on that horse sometime.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.245
Hey, Karen.

20:57.322 --> 21:00.485
-This crowd. You must be thrilled.
-Try crazy.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.959
It seems like every teenager
in the town showed up.

21:03.028 --> 21:04.427
So Andy made it.

21:04.496 --> 21:08.193
Yeah, I'm still trying to figure out
how to introduce him to Lucas.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.894
Well, think fast.

21:10.802 --> 21:13.600
So, Kings of Convenience?
I just got their album last week.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.663
-It's great.
-Man, you should see them live.

21:15.741 --> 21:18.938
Oh, God, I'll bet. So, how'd you find out
about the club?

21:19.745 --> 21:23.112
I'm actually kind of dating the woman
who's responsible for all this.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.274
Really? You're dating Peyton?

21:25.350 --> 21:27.215
-She's got the curly hair, right?
-Yeah.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.776
The cops would love that.

21:28.854 --> 21:31.550
-No, her name's Karen.
-Andy.

21:33.358 --> 21:34.416
Mom?

21:35.727 --> 21:36.785
Mom.

21:37.596 --> 21:38.824
Oh, boy.

21:40.165 --> 21:44.363
Lucas, this is Andy.
Andy, this is my son, Lucas.

21:46.238 --> 21:47.705
Little Lucas.

21:49.741 --> 21:53.302
I thought you were six. Not 6'1''.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.614
There's someone I want you to meet.

22:06.858 --> 22:07.882
Deb!

22:08.293 --> 22:10.727
Keith! I was hoping you'd make it.

22:11.763 --> 22:16.097
Jules, this is my sister-in-law, Deb.
Deb, this is Jules, my....

22:16.201 --> 22:19.796
-Girlfriend. Nice to meet you.
-This is my girlfriend, Jules.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.338
Nice to meet you, too.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.431
Thank you. I'll get us some drinks.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.840
Okay. I'll just take a water.

22:25.977 --> 22:27.706
Two tequilas it is.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.647
-She seems fun.
-Yeah, she's really great.

22:35.587 --> 22:39.683
It's nice to see good things
happen to you, Keith. You deserve it.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.771
Previously on <i>Saved by the Bell.</i>

22:54.840 --> 22:57.206
Hey, Chris. This is my husband, Nathan.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.106
-Hi.
-Married in high school.

22:59.177 --> 23:00.838
Yeah, that'll work.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.506
Peyton told me you bailed on the gig.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.846
I guess I was wrong about you.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.223
Appropriate response.
So, ready for our first dance?

23:19.865 --> 23:22.857
I don't know. Are friends
supposed to have a first dance?

23:22.934 --> 23:25.368
They are when they have potential.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.576
You wanna explain this?
My sister's topless.

23:37.649 --> 23:40.083
You wanna get that out of my face?

23:40.552 --> 23:42.782
Lucas, just walk away. Please?

23:45.857 --> 23:47.552
Outside. Now.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.901
-Are you out of your mind?
-Are you out of yours?

24:00.972 --> 24:03.463
It's because of crap like this
we had to move again.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.636
-And you know what? I liked my last life.
-Great. This again--

24:06.711 --> 24:09.145
You want people to talk?
Keep it up, 'cause they will.

24:09.214 --> 24:10.841
Just like the last time.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.885
Just because people say something
doesn't make it true, Felix.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.180
Those were rumors.

24:15.253 --> 24:18.051
Yeah? How do you think rumors
get started?

24:27.866 --> 24:30.198
<i>Hey, what's going on, Tree Hill?</i>

24:31.903 --> 24:34.701
<i>I'd like to welcome you guys</i>
<i>to the opening night of Tric.</i>

24:34.773 --> 24:39.005
<i>It's a night we like to call House of Freaks.</i>
<i>You guys ready? Yeah?</i>

24:39.077 --> 24:40.567
<i>Okay, great.</i>

24:40.645 --> 24:43.170
<i>Then please help me</i>
<i>in welcoming to the stage...</i>

24:43.381 --> 24:44.609
<i>Chris Keller.</i>

25:00.832 --> 25:03.096
-Hey, P. Sawyer.
-Hey.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.602
It's your big night.
Sorry I didn't get you anything.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.433
-I'm kind of on a budget.
-It's okay.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.235
Singer boy's a fox!

25:09.975 --> 25:12.136
-Hey, show us your--
-Hey!

25:17.415 --> 25:19.440
<i>All right, here we go, now.</i>

25:35.267 --> 25:36.325
<i>Hey!</i>

25:39.771 --> 25:42.069
<i>You guys aren't ready for this.</i>

25:45.443 --> 25:46.535
What?

25:50.382 --> 25:54.011
-What are you gonna do, right?
-Wait a second. What about Peyton?

25:54.085 --> 25:55.143
Tough break.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.053
At least it beats being screwed over
by a friend, right?

26:02.861 --> 26:06.297
<i>Sorry, everybody. We just had a little....</i>

26:07.098 --> 26:09.862
<i>I'm not.... Whatever that was.</i>

26:10.635 --> 26:14.264
<i>But while we're sorting it out,</i>
<i>the DJ's gonna play, and...</i>

26:16.041 --> 26:18.566
<i>how about a free round on the house?</i>

26:21.313 --> 26:22.780
No, all ages!

26:23.381 --> 26:26.111
<i>Of juice! A free round of juice.</i>

26:29.754 --> 26:31.346
What are you doing?

26:31.489 --> 26:32.649
-Not playing.
-Why?

26:32.724 --> 26:36.285
'Cause playing to a bunch of mall rats
who hate anything they can't pogo to...

26:36.361 --> 26:37.658
ain't what Chris Keller's about.

26:37.729 --> 26:40.960
That would've been nice for you to tell me
before I put you up on stage.

26:41.032 --> 26:44.195
And also that you talk about yourself
in the third person.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.703
Okay, I get it, Curly's pissed.
But look at it this way:

26:46.771 --> 26:47.999
If I hadn't done what I did...

26:48.073 --> 26:49.631
would she be up there right now?

26:56.715 --> 26:59.047
Don't think. Just play.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.971
So, you're saying you went through all this
just to get Haley up there to play?

27:24.042 --> 27:26.670
Who knows? Chris Keller ain't telling.

27:50.168 --> 27:52.762
You did a really good thing for her, Nate.

27:52.837 --> 27:56.432
No. She did it all by herself.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.672
Hey, Brooke. I like your dress. Is it new?

28:33.244 --> 28:35.542
Unfortunately, it's discount.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.580
That's hard to believe,
because you look beautiful.

28:50.528 --> 28:53.224
Why can't guys be more like you, Mouth?

28:53.732 --> 28:56.496
I mean, you're loyal, sweet.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.393
You bought my dollhouse back for me.

29:00.605 --> 29:03.335
-It wasn't that big a deal.
-Yes, it was.

29:05.110 --> 29:07.772
You know what you are? You are like...

29:09.047 --> 29:10.674
a really great...

29:12.350 --> 29:13.908
little brother.

29:35.740 --> 29:39.301
-She's really good.
-Yeah, she's really great.

29:39.744 --> 29:43.646
I've gotta bring my other boyfriends
back to see her next time.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.323
AII right!

30:29.594 --> 30:31.221
AII right, Haley!

30:35.800 --> 30:37.131
<i>Thank you.</i>

30:41.606 --> 30:44.871
I'm sorry. I had no idea
that was gonna happen.

30:44.943 --> 30:48.003
-And you don't deserve any of it.
-It's cool.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.782
-Don't worry about it.
-You sure?

30:56.387 --> 30:57.479
What?

30:58.122 --> 31:01.182
I just wouldn't mind
seeing that picture again.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.795
What the hell are you doing to Brooke?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.568
One second.

31:15.940 --> 31:18.807
-Is there a problem?
-Brooke is back there, wasted and alone.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.209
-So?
-Why aren't you doing something about it?

31:21.279 --> 31:23.247
And don't say you don't care,
because you do.

31:23.314 --> 31:26.249
Otherwise, why did you pay
for the dollhouse?

31:26.484 --> 31:29.146
Look, I don't need you
to understand any of it, Mouth.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.881
And the dollhouse is our secret.

31:30.955 --> 31:33.185
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm having a crummy night...

31:33.258 --> 31:35.226
and Theresa's about to change that.

31:36.194 --> 31:37.718
Stop it, Mouth.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.389
You got a problem with my friend?

31:42.467 --> 31:46.096
-Maybe I got a problem with you.
-Yeah, I think you do.

31:52.243 --> 31:55.474
You're lucky. I'm not gonna do this in here.

31:56.381 --> 31:57.905
That's too bad.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.284
Because I am.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.584
Felix, stop it!

32:12.797 --> 32:15.061
Stop it! Felix!

32:16.100 --> 32:19.501
-Get your damn hands off me!
-Not until I get you outside.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.299
Right. Everyone here's related.

32:21.372 --> 32:23.306
I get tossed
because you're the guy's uncle.

32:23.374 --> 32:25.604
No, you get tossed because you're an ass.

32:43.995 --> 32:45.895
So did you have fun tonight, Mom?

32:45.964 --> 32:50.298
Sure, if you don't count the part
where my son started punching people.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.234
I'm sorry.

32:54.238 --> 32:56.297
I didn't mean to ruin your night.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.740
Yeah, well, I didn't mean
to screw up your week.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.870
Then again, without the use
of your cell phone, MP3 player...

33:01.946 --> 33:03.345
and the car...

33:03.915 --> 33:05.143
it could suck for you.

33:06.684 --> 33:07.878
Trade.

33:13.424 --> 33:15.722
One week. Two, if you complain.

33:23.267 --> 33:24.757
How you doing?

33:25.737 --> 33:27.932
You should see the other guy.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.840
Well, I've got my mom's car,
so I'm gonna take off.

33:34.545 --> 33:36.570
-You sure?
-Yeah.

33:38.449 --> 33:40.679
But thanks for punching Felix.

33:41.219 --> 33:44.450
-I've been wanting to do that for years.
-Anytime.

33:47.258 --> 33:48.885
Call me tomorrow?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.260
You tell me.

33:57.435 --> 33:59.062
Call me tomorrow.

34:06.110 --> 34:09.806
I'm gonna go home, Mom.
And don't worry, I'm going straight home.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.509
-AII right. No streetfighting.
-Right.

34:14.385 --> 34:17.149
-Nice to meet you, Andy.
-Yeah, you, too.

34:21.324 --> 34:24.658
So, I guess that T-shirt I bought him
is gonna fit a little snug.

34:26.496 --> 34:27.896
Right, that.

34:28.466 --> 34:30.661
Why didn't you just tell me, Karen?

34:30.735 --> 34:33.203
I mean, your son's a teenager.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.706
Why do you think that would matter?

34:35.773 --> 34:37.764
Because it matters to me.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.139
Andy, I like you.

34:43.714 --> 34:48.208
But tonight, seeing you sitting there
with Lucas, it just seemed so normal.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.253
Like friends.

34:51.656 --> 34:52.679
So?

34:52.824 --> 34:55.224
Well, see, that makes sense to me.

34:57.061 --> 34:58.460
Look at us.

35:01.899 --> 35:04.800
I mean, does this picture
look right to you?

35:07.171 --> 35:09.401
Yes. To me, it does.

35:13.511 --> 35:17.072
But I think the more important question is:

35:18.950 --> 35:20.679
Does it feel right?

35:33.564 --> 35:36.431
-That feels good.
-Yeah, it does.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.407
The rest doesn't matter.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.709
Good night.

35:57.021 --> 35:58.181
-Good job.
-Thank you.

35:58.256 --> 35:59.780
You were great.

36:00.892 --> 36:03.417
-I really liked you.
-Thanks so much.

36:03.728 --> 36:06.561
Predictable sappy ballad. How does it feel?

36:07.365 --> 36:09.663
Great, until you just dissed me.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.860
No, look, you've got a good sound.
And watching you tonight...

36:12.937 --> 36:15.929
I could definitely see us
doing something together.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.235
Really?

36:17.308 --> 36:20.072
Yeah. I never joke about music.
Here's my number.

36:20.144 --> 36:22.078
I've got some studio time coming up.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.445
Wow, okay.

36:25.616 --> 36:26.947
I just remembered...

36:27.018 --> 36:29.282
<i>Thud</i> magazine wanted me to do
an interview with them.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.719
-It'll probably take a little while.
-No, it's cool.

36:31.789 --> 36:33.051
This is your night.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.853
-Go. Enjoy. I'll see you home.
-You sure?

36:34.926 --> 36:37.190
Yeah, I've got to work early
tomorrow, anyway.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.695
Okay. I love you. Thanks.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.758
You have any idea
how many guys in the room...

36:44.835 --> 36:46.496
wanna nail your wife right now?

37:23.841 --> 37:25.570
Good night, Brooke.

37:32.216 --> 37:33.581
I love you.

37:41.325 --> 37:44.624
-I was just checking on her.
-She's fine.

37:53.404 --> 37:55.565
-You like her, huh?
-Yeah.

37:57.308 --> 38:00.243
But guys like me don't get girls like her...

38:00.778 --> 38:02.973
and guys like you don't care.

38:03.147 --> 38:04.842
That's not true.

38:06.417 --> 38:10.046
Look, man, I owe you an apology.

38:16.527 --> 38:17.789
Friends?

38:22.900 --> 38:24.697
Just treat her right.

38:56.033 --> 38:58.467
-Felix.
-Hey, girl.

39:00.471 --> 39:01.961
You're a mess.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.604
You took care of me?

39:08.546 --> 39:09.638
Yeah.

39:11.248 --> 39:13.375
Sometimes you gotta break the rules.

39:23.961 --> 39:25.553
So, how'd we do?

39:25.996 --> 39:28.965
Well, it's a little early
for exact numbers, but...

39:29.033 --> 39:32.002
a few thousand nights like this
and I think we can retire.

39:32.069 --> 39:33.536
Works for me.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.934
-Deb, I need to ask you a question.
-Of course.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.275
I mean, it's stupid, and considering
the source, I shouldn't even ask.

39:43.347 --> 39:45.611
I probably don't even have
the right to ask, but--

39:45.683 --> 39:47.480
Karen, we're friends.

39:48.953 --> 39:50.113
Right.

39:53.290 --> 39:56.453
Yesterday, Dan told me
that you slept with Keith.

39:59.296 --> 40:00.786
Is that true?

40:05.503 --> 40:07.164
No, of course not.

40:16.547 --> 40:17.946
Well...

40:18.416 --> 40:20.407
that date had everything.

40:20.684 --> 40:24.245
Good conversation, dancing, fisticuffs.

40:25.523 --> 40:27.855
Yeah, I'm sorry about that part.

40:29.059 --> 40:31.027
So, I was thinking.

40:32.229 --> 40:35.665
-You called me your girlfriend tonight.
-Yeah.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.401
Well, if we were exclusive...

40:40.604 --> 40:43.539
just you and me,
would you be okay with that?

40:45.109 --> 40:47.009
I'd be great with that.

40:48.512 --> 40:50.275
Good. Me too.

40:59.990 --> 41:03.084
So what do you say, boyfriend?
Wanna sleep over?

41:07.031 --> 41:08.259
Oh, boy.

41:30.921 --> 41:32.582
So, a hell of a night, huh?

41:32.656 --> 41:35.819
Yes, I'm still shaking.
Thank you so much for everything.

41:35.893 --> 41:37.326
And I'm sorry about earlier.

41:37.394 --> 41:40.295
No, you totally redeemed yourself
after Indie-boy flaked on me.

41:40.364 --> 41:41.797
You ready to get out of here?

41:41.866 --> 41:44.232
Yes, but I've got to clear out
some stragglers.

41:47.137 --> 41:48.968
Relax. They're cool.

41:49.039 --> 41:51.803
In fact, Peyton and I did a couple of lines
the other night.

41:51.876 --> 41:53.639
Isn't that right, P?

42:10.828 --> 42:12.796
What do you want, Felix?

42:13.697 --> 42:15.562
Do you like my sister?

42:17.034 --> 42:18.524
You know I do.

42:18.836 --> 42:21.862
Too bad. Stay the hell away from her.

42:22.940 --> 42:24.840
-Is that an order?
-No.

42:25.943 --> 42:27.467
It's a warning.

43:09.286 --> 43:10.275
