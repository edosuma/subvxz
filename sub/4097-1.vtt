00:33.433 --> 00:36.435
The Bronx was like
a world of its own.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.470
In the early '70s, man,

00:38.472 --> 00:41.540
crime was like major income
of the Bronx.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.108
In the Bronx,

00:43.110 --> 00:45.077
it was a deep-rooted
gang culture.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.612
There were gangs literally
on every corner.

00:46.614 --> 00:48.347
The violence was everywhere.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.049
You could feel
the tension in the air.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.717
You could see the fights
across the street.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.519
You could hear the shots
in the nighttime.

01:01.161 --> 01:05.330
It was that fateful day
that I sent him to bring peace.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.633
That was one of the worst days
in South Bronx history.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.803
The word on the street was that
he was trying to make peace,

01:10.805 --> 01:12.638
and he was murdered
trying to make peace.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.640
Basically after that,
the South Bronx,

01:14.642 --> 01:16.308
fort Apache was out of control.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.110
They were running
through the streets.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.232
They were burning everything.
I mean, pandemonium hit.

01:27.854 --> 01:29.488
I put out a bulletin,

01:29.490 --> 01:32.558
and I started calling
all the ghetto brothers.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.660
Charlie wanted
to get the ghetto brothers

01:34.662 --> 01:37.229
to mobilize
for the biggest bloodbath

01:37.231 --> 01:38.797
in the history of New York.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.499
We lost a member.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.367
They viciously murdered him
out there in the street.

01:42.369 --> 01:43.869
Now It's an eye for an eye.

01:43.871 --> 01:48.107
The Bronx was gonna be bathed in
blood.

01:55.248 --> 01:58.217
How rumors spread,
how news spread.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.420
There was not a gang
in the whole of New York

02:01.422 --> 02:02.788
that was not aware
what's happening.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.190
And it was like
the movie "the warriors"

02:05.192 --> 02:07.192
when the lady's on the radio
telling everybody,

02:07.194 --> 02:09.595
"hey, Boppers, you've got
to make that move."

02:09.597 --> 02:11.630
Let's get down to it, Boppers.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.799
We're gonna a have
to do better out there.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.334
Everybody was tense
because nobody knew

02:15.336 --> 02:16.702
when it was gonna jump off.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.270
Remember that scene
from "the warriors"...

02:18.272 --> 02:19.705
"can you dig it"?

02:19.707 --> 02:21.773
That really went down.
That really happened.

02:21.775 --> 02:26.578
Can you dig it?!
Can you dig it?!

03:01.414 --> 03:05.317
We moved up to the South Bronx
in 1963

03:05.319 --> 03:08.754
from Greenwich village
to the South Bronx.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.722
It was a completely
different world.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.891
The buildings were beautiful,
very spacious.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.593
The blocks were wide.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.362
There were still Jews
living there at the time,

03:17.364 --> 03:20.599
pockets of Italians and Irish
still lived in the community.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.435
The South Bronx
at the time was fantastic.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.870
It was just a completely
different world.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.505
It was a world of discovery.

03:34.948 --> 03:39.851
In those days, I didn't
like the idea of joining a gang.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.720
I started my own thing.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.689
When I started
the ghetto brothers,

03:43.691 --> 03:45.891
originally it wasn't
supposed to be a gang.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.726
It wasn't supposed
to be an organization.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.228
It was a brother thing.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.996
It was basically
my brothers and I.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.465
We lived in Manhattan,
we moved to the Bronx,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.367
and those days,
it was the ghetto.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.469
So we were ghetto brothers.
Who were ghetto brothers?

03:57.471 --> 04:00.639
Robin, Benjy, Victor,
those were the ghetto brothers,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.507
my brothers, okay?

04:02.509 --> 04:05.277
Then later on,
since I knew a lot of the kids

04:05.279 --> 04:07.012
in the community,
I was very friendly,

04:07.014 --> 04:09.348
I was amicable,
everybody got along with me,

04:09.350 --> 04:11.450
so I said, you know,
let's expand this.

04:16.755 --> 04:20.559
I met Charlie at 150th St.
And trinity Avenue.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.527
I was with my friend Raymond.
He was like a brother.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.597
We grew up together,
and we saw this guy

04:25.599 --> 04:28.767
taking a wood thing
and going... bah!

04:28.769 --> 04:30.569
And breaking it. I said wow.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.372
I found that amazing because
I was into the martial arts.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.475
And I said, "that is fantastic
I wanna make friends with him."

04:36.477 --> 04:37.709
That was me.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.645
"I want to make friends
with this guy."

04:39.647 --> 04:44.316
I walk up T him, and I said,
"hi, my name is Benjy."

04:44.318 --> 04:47.686
It's 1960-something.

04:47.688 --> 04:52.624
I only know they rob,
they steal.

04:52.626 --> 04:56.695
Nobody's gonna rob me.
So I prepare.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.298
I'm ready to take this guy on.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.999
"I just want to shake
your hand."

05:01.001 --> 05:02.334
That's Charlie.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.702
I said, okay,

05:03.704 --> 05:06.638
the moment he moves,
his ass is mine.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.675
But he's standing there
with his hand out,

05:09.677 --> 05:12.678
and he starts telling me
about there's a few guys

05:12.680 --> 05:16.448
that study martial arts
that he's been watching,

05:16.450 --> 05:20.585
and he can imagine that I'm
a pretty good martial artist.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.854
"And we sat down,
he said what's your style?"

05:22.856 --> 05:24.823
I Says, "I'm Goju. Talk to me."

05:24.825 --> 05:27.092
And we just talked
and talked and talked.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.062
I stick out my hand,
I put my hand in his,

05:30.064 --> 05:35.033
and the ghetto brothers are one.

05:43.743 --> 05:46.111
<i>The '60s
were a time of worldwide</i>

05:46.113 --> 05:48.480
<i>social and cultural reckoning.</i>

05:48.482 --> 05:50.816
<i>With movements demanding change
spreading across</i>

05:50.818 --> 05:52.984
<i>the college campuses
and the front lines</i>

05:52.986 --> 05:55.053
<i>of America's ghettos,
it truly felt</i>

05:55.055 --> 05:58.523
<i>like the seeds for a full-blown
revolution were being sown.</i>

06:09.001 --> 06:11.403
So we thought this revolution
was gonna happen.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.705
We knew that this was the end
of the world order.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.974
We thought revolution
was possible.

06:15.976 --> 06:20.011
For the first time,
we had a multicultural movement.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.514
For me, it reconfirmed
in a strange way

06:22.516 --> 06:23.782
my faith in America.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.927
<i>But as the '60s came to a close,</i>

06:35.929 --> 06:37.696
<i>the Vietnam war and racism</i>

06:37.698 --> 06:39.965
<i>continue to erode America's soul</i>

06:39.967 --> 06:41.833
<i>and fade all optimism.</i>

06:41.835 --> 06:44.569
<i>A systematic backlash
against organizations</i>

06:44.571 --> 06:47.506
<i>like the black panthers
coupled with the assassinations</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.841
<i>of nearly every iconic figure
of hope</i>

06:49.843 --> 06:52.477
<i>left a new generation
with nothing more</i>

06:52.479 --> 06:54.012
<i>than unfocused rage.</i>

06:54.014 --> 06:55.414
They killed the king.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.683
And then they killed Kennedy.

06:58.685 --> 07:02.421
My heroes died in the '60s.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.423
The hope is deflated.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.992
I was so mad at America.
I was pissed.

07:06.994 --> 07:08.994
Heard of the troubled '60s?

07:08.996 --> 07:12.164
Well, the troubled '60s
give rise to the violent '70s.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.202
"I have a dream."

07:17.204 --> 07:19.604
No, you don't.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.473
"My people!

07:21.475 --> 07:23.909
We will overcome!"

07:23.911 --> 07:26.711
Boom, no,
you're not gonna overcome.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.080
You ain't getting nobody
out of this fucking ghetto.

07:32.919 --> 07:34.853
Remember the '60s?

07:34.855 --> 07:36.655
Hey!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.223
Peace!

07:38.225 --> 07:41.159
Now it was peace.

07:51.237 --> 07:54.973
<i>America's unrest was reflected
locally as New York City</i>

07:54.975 --> 07:58.176
<i>struggled under the weight
of its own mounting crises.</i>

07:58.178 --> 08:00.979
<i>A failed vision
of urban renewal pushed all</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:03.081
<i>but the city's wealthiest
to the brink</i>

08:03.083 --> 08:05.016
<i>and a new pessimism
and desperation</i>

08:05.018 --> 08:07.185
<i>made its home in its streets.</i>

08:07.187 --> 08:10.922
Here was this great city,
the international capital

08:10.924 --> 08:16.061
of commerce and culture
and communications and finance,

08:16.063 --> 08:20.198
and it was on its knees asking,
begging for help.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.534
The city was on the edge
of bankruptcy.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.904
All through the '70s remember,
industries were departing.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.672
Jobs were disappearing.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.808
If there was
a safety net before,

08:29.810 --> 08:32.744
the federal government
was basically not just ceasing

08:32.746 --> 08:34.546
to protect it
but cutting holes in it.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.826
<i>Despite the city's
financial troubles, in 1970,</i>

08:47.828 --> 08:50.529
<i>New York's cultural scene
was as vibrant as ever,</i>

08:50.531 --> 08:52.564
<i>construction
of the world trade center</i>

08:52.566 --> 08:54.599
<i>would soon be complete,
and the New York Knicks</i>

08:54.601 --> 08:56.535
<i>would win their first
championship.</i>

08:56.537 --> 08:58.737
<i>However, only four Miles away,</i>

08:58.739 --> 09:00.872
<i>due to reckless urban planning,</i>

09:00.874 --> 09:02.240
<i>the district of the South Bronx</i>

09:02.242 --> 09:04.009
<i>was rapidly becoming a symbol</i>

09:04.011 --> 09:06.111
<i>of urban decay around the world.</i>

09:06.113 --> 09:09.748
When we were young,
we remember Robert Moses.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.783
I remember the teacher
talked about a guy

09:11.785 --> 09:13.652
who was fixing up the area.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.087
They were saying
they were renovating the area.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.623
Buildings are being
taken out of commission.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.058
Hey, gotta go.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.626
We're gonna build
this highway over here.

09:21.628 --> 09:23.695
The cross Bronx expressway
at one time,

09:23.697 --> 09:27.265
that whole area was nothing
but houses, beautiful houses.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.167
He takes a wonderful borough

09:29.169 --> 09:31.636
that's made up of ployglot...
I mean, everybody was there,

09:31.638 --> 09:34.573
Ralph Lauren comes from there...
and he cuts across,

09:34.575 --> 09:35.907
he cuts a huge swath,

09:35.909 --> 09:37.976
literally destroying
the neighborhoods.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.578
This is amazing.

09:39.580 --> 09:40.979
I mean, It's amazingly creative

09:40.981 --> 09:43.682
even though it was also
humanly destructive

09:43.684 --> 09:46.985
that he thought the shortest
distance between two points

09:46.987 --> 09:48.987
is a line even If there
are houses

09:48.989 --> 09:51.723
and people, you know,
in the way of the line.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.992
And that's when things
started to go down.

09:53.994 --> 09:58.763
The economy, the store owners,
everybody just took off.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.099
You see a quiet white flight

10:01.101 --> 10:03.101
where everybody was migrating,
you know,

10:03.103 --> 10:07.339
from the concourse up to,
you know, Nyack, white plains.

10:07.341 --> 10:08.940
"Come on up, pops, come on up.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.742
"You can't stay down here
no more," you know?

10:10.744 --> 10:15.180
The rich move out
to their second and third homes.

10:15.182 --> 10:19.184
The middle class
is not far behind,

10:19.186 --> 10:21.653
and left will be the poor

10:21.655 --> 10:25.824
who require enormous services
and who will suffer.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.399
The South Bronx.

10:34.401 --> 10:37.802
It has all the superlatives...
highest crime,

10:37.804 --> 10:40.038
poorest people,
greatest unemployment,

10:40.040 --> 10:41.306
worst blight,

10:41.308 --> 10:43.308
and the world's record
for arson.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.111
In just 10 years,
more than 30,000 buildings

10:46.113 --> 10:48.380
have been set ablaze
and abandoned here.

10:48.382 --> 10:51.316
You got rats, bugs,
no heat, no water.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.418
It was terrible, terrible.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.887
It's like another
domino effect here.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.123
Then you see the burnings start.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.726
The landlord
wouldn't provide services,

11:01.728 --> 11:04.062
and the people had
to ultimately move out,

11:04.064 --> 11:06.197
and then the landlord
burned the building down

11:06.199 --> 11:07.899
and got the insurance.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.402
You know, having buildings
torched was the norm.

11:10.404 --> 11:13.304
The Bronx was like
a world of its own.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.975
The Bronx to us
was a whole world.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.343
Well, this morning
on our way into work,

11:18.345 --> 11:21.780
we had a report
that the police had located

11:21.782 --> 11:26.217
a carcass in the street
on 172nd and Bryant.

11:26.219 --> 11:30.021
Turned out to be a stripped
carcass of a gorilla.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.457
It was headless,
and the fur was removed,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.325
the skin was removed.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.161
South Bronx.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.438
It was just a feeling
of hopelessness.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.374
It wasn't like murder
was hidden.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.910
You know,
murder was very rampant.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.846
The number
of homicides about quadrupled

11:54.848 --> 11:58.817
from 1960 to 1971.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.218
There was crime from, like,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.353
the crooked politicians
to the crooked cops.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.490
In the early '70s, man,
crime was like...

12:05.492 --> 12:08.326
crime was like the major income
of the Bronx.

12:08.328 --> 12:12.230
There was lines of people
wrapped around the corner

12:12.232 --> 12:16.101
just waiting to buy a bundle
or a couple of bags of dope.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.736
When the cops drive up and down,

12:17.738 --> 12:20.839
it was like
a total pharmacy drugstore.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.108
When it got virulent,
people got into it.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.210
It's almost as If
they wanted to die,

12:25.212 --> 12:29.013
and so they got into heroin
because there was no dream.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.796
All this stuff was happening.

12:44.798 --> 12:47.432
It was too much
for anybody to understand,

12:47.434 --> 12:50.435
but one of the byproducts

12:50.437 --> 12:53.138
was a lot of kids out
on the street

12:53.140 --> 12:55.206
and a lot of locations
that would have been

12:55.208 --> 12:58.176
alternatives to the street
ceasing to exist.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.544
The system
had totally let us down.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.446
They let us do
what we wanted to do.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.815
We deal with
whatever we deal with.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.050
They deal with it
in their own manner.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.519
At the police department
was beating on us

13:07.521 --> 13:10.054
like they had a permission card.

13:10.056 --> 13:13.057
It was just total chaos.
There was nothing for us here.

13:13.059 --> 13:15.527
So we turned to each other
and said, you know,

13:15.529 --> 13:17.495
let's do something
for ourselves.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.164
Basically, that was it.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.232
Every gang was for themselves
back then.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.135
We had nobody looking
out for us, so it was us.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.538
It was the brotherhood,
it was the gang, and that's it.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.551
<i>Out of the rubble
and chaos of the city,</i>

13:39.553 --> 13:42.420
<i>a new breed
of outlaw street gangs arose,</i>

13:42.422 --> 13:44.889
<i>transforming the urban wasteland</i>

13:44.891 --> 13:47.392
<i>to a dark
and dangerous playground.</i>

13:47.394 --> 13:49.194
<i>Police estimated gang membership</i>

13:49.196 --> 13:52.564
<i>in the tens of thousands,
and these new outlaws</i>

13:52.566 --> 13:56.201
<i>maintained a firm grip
on New York City's streets.</i>

13:56.203 --> 13:58.570
The mentality of the gangs
that came out of the '70s

13:58.572 --> 14:00.572
was very violent.

14:00.574 --> 14:03.308
The street gangs that was
coming out in the late '60s,

14:03.310 --> 14:07.979
early '70s was more what
you could say savage and outlaw.

14:07.981 --> 14:11.049
These guys kicked you
and cursed you

14:11.051 --> 14:14.152
and spit on you
and urinated on you,

14:14.154 --> 14:18.957
and then showed you,
"this is who did it."

14:18.959 --> 14:20.992
Weren't you charged
with shooting a policeman?

14:20.994 --> 14:23.328
Yeah, last time I got busted,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.430
they told me, "we gonna catch
you one of these nights",

14:25.432 --> 14:27.632
and we're gonna kill you."
Some people would say

14:27.634 --> 14:30.101
they'd be very worried
If somebody told them that.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.270
Why don't you?

14:32.272 --> 14:35.039
Because, you know,
If I'm gonna die,

14:35.041 --> 14:37.475
you know,
let it happen now than later.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.621
It was all about power.

14:49.623 --> 14:51.322
I ain't got a pops.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.091
My moms ain't gonna
tell me what to do.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.259
I have all this anger.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.127
I'm gonna grab all these guys,

14:56.129 --> 14:57.896
and they're gonna do my bidding.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.497
So whatever I want
that lacked in my life,

14:59.499 --> 15:01.099
I'm gonna get it right now.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.934
It wasn't like you had a choice.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.637
Whatever gang ran the block,
you had to be a part of it.

15:05.639 --> 15:07.405
There was no civilians.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.108
You had to be in it
or you were a victim.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.410
On the outside looking in,
it looked really good.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.145
We're fighting all the time.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.481
We didn't take
any bullshit from anybody.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.117
We pretty much did
whatever we wanted.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.089
There was nothing
to look forward to.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.992
This was our life.
We lived for each other.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.094
We lived and died
for each other.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.663
We bled for each other.

15:31.665 --> 15:35.033
Whether you was right or wrong,
it didn't matter.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.372
In the steel and concrete jungle

15:41.374 --> 15:44.309
of the big city,
a tribal group survives,

15:44.311 --> 15:46.010
the one-percenters.

15:46.012 --> 15:49.080
These are the motorcycle freaks.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.082
They get a charge
out of spooking the citizens

15:51.084 --> 15:52.617
in a straight neighborhood.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.285
They live in a different world,

15:54.287 --> 15:57.021
in a strange cop-out world
of their own making.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.489
With a kick pedal and a boot,

15:58.491 --> 16:01.059
they work off their frustrations
on the maddened street.

16:05.297 --> 16:10.668
Everybody wanted to be the giant
that everyone's afraid of.

16:10.670 --> 16:15.106
Everybody wanted to be
the hells angel.

16:15.108 --> 16:20.645
Everybody wanted to be the guy
on the roaring machine.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.681
Real hard-core motorcycle,
you know,

16:23.683 --> 16:26.484
outlaw culture adapted
to the streets of New York.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.454
We had pretty much accepted it.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.389
Puerto Ricans in general
and blacks, they're like,

16:31.391 --> 16:33.224
"fuck it," you know what I mean?

16:33.226 --> 16:35.593
"We're gonna fuck everything,
you know?"

16:35.595 --> 16:39.564
Because of the anger
that we had towards the system,

16:39.566 --> 16:43.634
we figure, "well, fuck it,
we can do that, too."

16:43.636 --> 16:45.570
You know,
they were raising hell,

16:45.572 --> 16:47.672
and we figure
we could raise hell

16:47.674 --> 16:51.509
because we had something
to raise hell against.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.544
As much as America
thinks we're not watching it,

16:53.546 --> 16:57.148
we are watching it,
and we're imitating it.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.717
And so what you see
with the retention

16:59.719 --> 17:01.719
of some of the garb,
the biker garb,

17:01.721 --> 17:05.356
what you see is Americana,
but It's an outlaw Americana.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.724
They don't want to be Mr. wasp,

17:07.727 --> 17:10.461
but they can see themselves
as hells angels.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.300
And, yeah, we had
the swastikas and everything

17:17.303 --> 17:19.670
because they had
the swastikas and everything.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.339
We tried to emulate them
as much as possible,

17:22.342 --> 17:25.042
and as they wanted
to shock society,

17:25.045 --> 17:26.810
we wanted to shock society.

17:26.813 --> 17:30.348
So we just wanted
to be as repulsive

17:30.350 --> 17:32.483
and repugnant as possible.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.720
We put the colors on the floor.
The guys surround the colors.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.255
Everybody takes out their penis

17:37.257 --> 17:39.223
and starts leaking
on the jacket,

17:39.225 --> 17:41.159
and then If you're lucky,
the guy vomits.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.694
Then you take your jacket...

17:43.696 --> 17:45.396
Put it on, wha!

17:45.398 --> 17:48.132
That's an outlaw.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.401
And not even flies
will want to hang around you!

18:00.579 --> 18:03.448
The patches are the family's
coat of arms.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.616
The colors is your shield.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.486
Most of the gangs of yesteryear

18:08.488 --> 18:11.656
wasn't nervous
to say who they were.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.559
So If you was a skull,
a spade, a reaper, a turban,

18:14.561 --> 18:19.230
you would wear with honor
on your back of who you was.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.265
Supreme enchanters,
you see that?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.568
Javelins, you see?
Get a good look at it.

18:26.371 --> 18:28.806
Gang culture street law Says,
"this is our turf."

18:28.808 --> 18:30.341
If you want to walk
through our turf,

18:30.343 --> 18:32.210
this is like our nation.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.679
In order to pass through
our nation,

18:34.681 --> 18:37.815
you have to show respect
and not fly your colors

18:37.817 --> 18:39.517
"'cause this is our turf."

18:39.519 --> 18:41.119
You walked into another turf

18:41.121 --> 18:42.720
and you didn't have
their permission,

18:42.722 --> 18:45.490
you might lose your colors
or you might lose your life.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.625
I mean, you would walk
certain places,

18:47.627 --> 18:50.394
they see you in a cut-off
dungaree jacket,

18:50.396 --> 18:51.762
yo, they'd take it from you,

18:51.764 --> 18:53.498
stomp you out
and stuff like that.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.733
I mean, If you had
M.C. Boots on,

18:55.735 --> 18:57.602
you weren't in the club,
you're walking home barefoot.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.203
If you could walk.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.842
They'd just beat
you up, take your colors,

19:04.844 --> 19:07.645
hang 'em up on a wall,
that's how they used to do it.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.347
Our conquered enemies.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.582
Those are our conquered enemies
right there.

19:11.584 --> 19:14.352
Bachelors, encounters Bron...
enchanters Bronx,

19:14.354 --> 19:16.254
royal javelins, Latin eagles.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.663
Girls had major roles
because back then,

19:25.665 --> 19:27.298
there were no policewomen.

19:27.300 --> 19:31.369
So we'd carry the guns,
which was a big issue

19:31.371 --> 19:34.805
because If the cops stopped you,
they'd tell the women,

19:34.807 --> 19:37.542
"keep it moving,"
and they would search the guys.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.610
The guys are beautiful.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.345
We all get along.

19:41.347 --> 19:45.349
We're calling each other
you know?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.785
That means respect.
We're brothers and sisters.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.388
We got respect for each other.
Brothers and sisters.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.822
We bore their babies.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.325
We fought alongside them,
not behind them

19:54.327 --> 19:55.960
or in front of them,
although many of us

19:55.962 --> 19:59.564
did fight in front of them,
but we were hand-in-hand.

20:03.902 --> 20:06.237
Back then, to join a gang,

20:06.239 --> 20:07.905
you did have to go through
initiations.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.408
For every gang,
the standard initiation

20:10.410 --> 20:12.243
is the Apache line.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.879
The Apache line is something
we used to test your mettle

20:14.881 --> 20:16.547
and your fighting skills
and your heart.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.816
People would set up
on each side,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.952
and somebody would beat you
with their fists.

20:20.954 --> 20:24.622
Some gangs might even hit you
with bats or sticks.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.391
It's almost like going through
rites of passage.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.769
Other guys was jumping a cop.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.338
We used to have to fight.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.973
It wasn't a choice.
We had to fight.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.242
But ours was different.
We didn't do the Apache line.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.643
We had a 45.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.245
As long as that record
was playing,

20:47.247 --> 20:48.879
you had to fight
three guys at the same time.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.649
So we put grand funk rail road,
you're gonna have to...

20:51.651 --> 20:53.551
"all right, song's finished."

20:57.990 --> 20:59.724
One day I looked
at my brother Victor, said,

20:59.726 --> 21:00.992
"Vic, I'm going to the store.
Take care of this.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.727
I'll be right back."
Go to the store.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.362
Come back, he had an album.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.863
"I said what the hell you doing
with an album?!"

21:05.865 --> 21:07.932
"I just want to see
the guys beat him up."

21:07.934 --> 21:10.334
Supposed to be a 45.
He had an album on.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.370
The poor guy got his jaw broken.

21:12.372 --> 21:15.006
The skulls were the ultimate

21:15.008 --> 21:19.410
because their Apache line
was a .32...

21:19.412 --> 21:23.981
one shell, spin,
and pull the trigger.

21:33.492 --> 21:34.859
<i>From the Saigons of Harlem</i>

21:34.861 --> 21:37.061
<i>to the jolly stompers
of Brooklyn,</i>

21:37.063 --> 21:40.431
<i>outlaw gangs followed a system
of law and organization</i>

21:40.433 --> 21:42.967
<i>that was common despite
their glaring differences.</i>

21:42.969 --> 21:46.837
The ranks in most gangs,
there was only three levels.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.340
There was the president,
the vice president,

21:49.342 --> 21:50.775
and the warlord.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.811
Your president,
he had to have the charisma,

21:53.813 --> 21:56.947
and everybody
would want to follow him.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.817
There has to be someone you
respect and someone you admire

21:59.819 --> 22:02.420
to give you a different
perspective.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.723
That person has to have
not only the power of love

22:05.725 --> 22:08.426
but the ability
to beat you down.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.895
Vice president came in

22:10.897 --> 22:13.497
in case the president
was ever killed.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.000
And then you had the warlord,
and the warlord was the person

22:16.002 --> 22:18.469
that either declared
or stopped a war.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.539
The warlord was the one
who would go in and negotiate,

22:21.541 --> 22:23.774
to see If you're gonna go to war
with just the hands,

22:23.776 --> 22:27.345
the bats, chains and knives,
or the guns.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.447
Some gangs had gestapo,

22:29.449 --> 22:31.982
and those with the guys
that were in charge

22:31.984 --> 22:36.587
of inflicting punishment
on their members.

22:36.589 --> 22:37.788
They were like the police.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.657
Like, you policed your own gang.

22:39.659 --> 22:41.992
There you go, cool off.

22:41.994 --> 22:45.863
The gestapo were like
the real hard-core gang guys.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.133
Like, they followed street law
to the "T."

22:49.135 --> 22:53.003
I represent gestapo
in the savage nomads,

22:53.005 --> 22:54.638
which is a different squad.

22:54.640 --> 22:58.075
I get one of my members
where school's up

22:58.077 --> 23:00.111
but doesn't know
how to behave on the street

23:00.113 --> 23:02.546
or talk to anybody like
a human being

23:02.548 --> 23:05.883
the way he's supposed to,
he comes to my little cell here.

23:10.822 --> 23:13.824
Biggest gangs in Brooklyn
from my time,

23:13.826 --> 23:15.993
known gangs, the dirty ones.

23:15.995 --> 23:17.962
The dirty ones,
they were the most famous.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.498
We heard about
the tomahawks out in Brooklyn.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.833
Gangs like
the assassinators, the Dukes.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.668
And the homicides.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.704
The majestics, sandpipers.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.006
There were gangs
literally in every corner.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.441
Dynamite brothers
were a big gang

23:30.443 --> 23:31.776
in the lower east side.

23:31.778 --> 23:33.711
Towards the lower east side,

23:33.713 --> 23:35.012
you had the choccos.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.614
You had the Harlem Turks.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.416
You had the renegades of Harlem.

23:44.823 --> 23:48.826
In those days, the meanest
borough was the Bronx.

23:48.828 --> 23:51.061
You came from the Bronx,
you was bad.

23:51.063 --> 23:53.831
It all started up in the Bronx.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.566
In the Bronx,

23:55.568 --> 23:58.869
it was a deep-rooted gang
culture, okay?

23:58.871 --> 24:00.438
They lived it.

24:07.913 --> 24:12.483
There was 101 gangs
in the Bronx, so take your pick.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.852
Black assassins, peacemakers.

24:14.854 --> 24:18.622
Roman kings.
Young kids, deadly.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.958
You see them,
they're little kids.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.660
You look at them wrong,
they're gonna shoot you.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.529
The turbans,
the javelins, reapers.

24:25.531 --> 24:28.599
Seven immortals.

24:28.601 --> 24:29.934
Turbans.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.469
Turbans.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.137
Ex-veterans from Vietnam.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.474
These guys didn't have guns.
They had rifles.

24:36.476 --> 24:40.044
Bachelors was... there were big.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.880
One of the biggest gangs
in the Bronx... black spades.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.548
Black spades had a division

24:44.550 --> 24:46.817
in every area
they had a police department.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.886
Black spades,
you could count them

24:48.888 --> 24:50.888
because when they came,
like, they blackened,

24:50.890 --> 24:53.023
like, the whole street.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.526
We had nothing
but respect for them

24:55.528 --> 24:56.627
because
they earned their respect.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.029
The savage nomads.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.765
These guys,
once they put those colors

25:01.767 --> 25:03.934
on, remember doctor Jekyll
and mister Hyde?

25:03.936 --> 25:05.803
These guys turned mean.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.605
Savage skulls.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.840
Savage skulls was one
of the most respected gangs

25:09.842 --> 25:11.709
that walked the streets.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.917
There was gangs
in the north Bronx also,

25:19.919 --> 25:22.753
and they were predominantly
white gangs, right,

25:22.755 --> 25:25.523
and they was just as vicious
as gangs

25:25.525 --> 25:27.758
in central Harlem
and the South Bronx.

25:27.760 --> 25:32.162
You had gangs
like the war pigs, the aliens,

25:32.164 --> 25:35.900
white lightning,
junior KKK, grateful dead,

25:35.902 --> 25:38.068
and these guys were like
a lot of guys, right?

25:38.070 --> 25:39.637
Famous... golden guineas.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.539
Well, the golden guineas
I would have to say,

25:41.541 --> 25:43.908
they were the baddest white boys
on the block.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.843
They weren't taking
no crap from nobody

25:45.845 --> 25:47.144
as far as they were concerned,

25:47.146 --> 25:49.246
and we had to give them
their respect.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.815
181st, 182nd,

25:51.817 --> 25:54.118
and that was like the cut-off
right there.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.888
Yo, dude, If we went up
to Fordham road, it was on.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.324
We had guns, but we didn't have
guns like <i> they</i> had guns.

26:00.326 --> 26:03.160
These guys had transportation,
they have the weaponry,

26:03.162 --> 26:05.563
you know,
and they have the balls.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.331
The golden guineas,

26:07.333 --> 26:11.101
now they had a reputation
for cutting two gs

26:11.103 --> 26:14.572
into your face so that you know

26:14.574 --> 26:17.775
that you ran
into the golden guineas.

26:19.811 --> 26:21.979
Good evening.
I'm David Susskind.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.948
First part of the show tonight

26:23.950 --> 26:26.250
are the emergence
of the street gangs once again.

26:26.252 --> 26:29.720
My guests are leaders
and spokesmen for these gangs.

26:29.722 --> 26:30.921
I want you to meet them now.

26:30.923 --> 26:33.223
First, Benjy Melendez

26:33.225 --> 26:35.593
is a spokesman
for the ghetto brothers.

26:35.595 --> 26:37.695
Former marine Charlie Suarez

26:37.697 --> 26:39.964
is the president
of the ghetto brothers.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.973
With the black panthers
and the young lords,

26:48.975 --> 26:50.841
the further you got in the '70s,

26:50.843 --> 26:54.845
the less influence they had
on the younger generation,

26:54.847 --> 26:58.382
even the older generation.

26:58.384 --> 27:02.786
The ghetto brothers was
kind of like filling that void,

27:02.788 --> 27:05.956
but they still
had that street cred.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.959
We are being oppressed
by the north American Yankee.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.162
We the Puerto Ricans should
rise up and defend ourselves

27:11.163 --> 27:13.197
against these dogs
who will oppress us

27:13.199 --> 27:16.300
and liberate our country
from capitalism and imperialism.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.268
The north American is trying
to steal our identity

27:18.270 --> 27:21.138
as Puerto Ricans
and call us Americans.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.840
We Puerto Ricans
are Puerto Ricans

27:22.842 --> 27:25.142
to the day we are born
until the day we die.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.648
When the black panthers
came into the scene,

27:30.650 --> 27:32.282
the young lords
came into the scene,

27:32.284 --> 27:34.652
these groups went
around talking to the gangs,

27:34.654 --> 27:36.153
"stop the violence.

27:36.155 --> 27:39.189
Let's direct
all our energy this way."

27:39.191 --> 27:40.958
Lot of the gangs
didn't want to hear that.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.760
The ghetto brothers
took heat to that.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.662
What we wanted
them to do is understand

27:44.664 --> 27:46.330
that there was another vision
of America,

27:46.332 --> 27:48.232
that they were killing
themselves...

27:48.234 --> 27:52.002
that's what our intent was...
and that the neighborhoods

27:52.004 --> 27:55.773
that they were in
were their neighborhoods.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.442
We wanted them to feel ownership
over those blocks.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.078
There's a lot of clubs that help
just their own friends

28:01.080 --> 28:03.180
and forget about other people
who live around us, you know?

28:03.182 --> 28:05.749
But we don't think like that. We
like to help everybody.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.093
I loved the ghetto brothers.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.096
We honored them because
they were... they seemed...

28:19.098 --> 28:21.165
to me, it seemed like they had
enough courage to do something

28:21.167 --> 28:22.933
that we all really wanted to do

28:22.935 --> 28:24.802
but didn't have the courage
to do it

28:24.804 --> 28:28.005
because you were known for
your brutality in those days.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.807
You weren't known
for being a nice guy.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.975
Ghetto brothers
was definitely political minded,

28:31.977 --> 28:34.812
but they also, you know,
didn't take no shit either.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.714
It wasn't that
they couldn't fight.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.882
That was the South Bronx.
There's no not fighting.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.418
So even If you're a nice guy,
everybody had to fight.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.787
If you saw them coming down
the block, you know,

28:43.789 --> 28:46.356
okay, the ghetto brothers,
they're cool.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.892
They got a lot
of kids off the street.

28:48.894 --> 28:53.097
They got a lot of kids, man, like, going
back into school. From what I understand,

28:53.099 --> 28:54.865
they did start helping
the neighborhoods a lot.

28:54.867 --> 28:57.367
So far, since I've been
in the ghetto brothers,

28:57.369 --> 28:59.336
they have Dave me back
my self-respect

28:59.338 --> 29:01.505
because I am an ex-junkie.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.841
They was with me
almost 24 hours a day.

29:03.843 --> 29:05.743
I kicked cold.

29:05.745 --> 29:08.312
More than eight or nine
ghetto brothers

29:08.314 --> 29:10.380
in the organization
that we got now are ex-junkies,

29:10.382 --> 29:13.350
and If you go right now to
ghetto brothers headquarters,

29:13.352 --> 29:15.185
you don't see no junkies
in that block no more.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.020
The ghetto brothers
started to grow

29:17.022 --> 29:19.857
and grow and grow and grow.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.392
2,500 in the Bronx alone!

29:22.394 --> 29:24.928
Then the ghetto brothers
started to expand

29:24.930 --> 29:27.898
to Manhattan, Brooklyn, queens.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.135
They knew how to articulate
and use the media

29:31.137 --> 29:35.339
to actually let
not just New York City

29:35.341 --> 29:38.842
but kind of let
the United States know that,

29:38.844 --> 29:42.112
look, this is happening
here in New York City, right?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.982
I guess It's what the teenagers
are gonna make it, right?

29:44.984 --> 29:46.784
If we shoot dope,
they're gonna be shooting dope

29:46.786 --> 29:49.019
when they get older,
and If they see

29:49.021 --> 29:51.121
the ghetto brothers...
like my club is doing,

29:51.123 --> 29:53.157
that we are...
get ourselves together,

29:53.159 --> 29:54.925
we do something
from the community,

29:54.927 --> 29:56.560
then they're gonna think
that's what's hip.

29:56.562 --> 30:01.165
We're in the ghetto.
Someone smashes a bottle.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.867
Someone bends a can
and tosses it.

30:03.869 --> 30:06.470
Someone grabs a piece of paper
and tosses it.

30:06.472 --> 30:11.508
We're in the ghetto
because we created the ghetto.

30:11.510 --> 30:14.044
So we just said no more.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.213
No more.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.349
I started to think,
I said it would be good

30:19.351 --> 30:21.518
to channel all this energy

30:21.520 --> 30:24.354
into doing something
for our community.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.456
Let's have a good time.
Let's get together.

30:26.458 --> 30:29.226
Let's sweep the community.
Let's give out free food.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.361
Let's give out clothes
to this community

30:31.363 --> 30:33.230
because in those times,
things were really bad.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.598
I want people to say

30:34.600 --> 30:36.133
the ghetto brothers
has done something.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.035
I want my child to say
when he grows up

30:38.037 --> 30:40.938
my father's done
something for society, see?

30:40.940 --> 30:42.606
And I want things to change
because I don't want

30:42.608 --> 30:45.209
to be living in the South Bronx
where everything is messed up.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.316
Three names
that always popped up...

30:52.318 --> 30:56.253
Benjy, karate Charlie,
and black Benji.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.488
You know,
I'm an ex-drug addict.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.190
I'm not gonna lie about it.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.860
When I came to them,
I was still using drugs.

31:02.862 --> 31:05.295
Due respect to them,
and I went to kick.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.631
I've been straight since,
and I love ghetto brothers.

31:07.633 --> 31:10.067
There's a purpose here.

31:10.069 --> 31:12.870
It's something that's beneficial
to the neighborhood,

31:12.872 --> 31:14.905
the establishment,
and everybody else.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.407
Black Benji, Benjamin Cornell

31:17.409 --> 31:19.142
was introduced to me by Charlie.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.578
He said, "Benji wants to
check out the ghetto brothers."

31:21.580 --> 31:23.347
Sure.
I said, "would do you do?"

31:23.349 --> 31:25.115
He said, "I work as a drug
counselor."

31:25.117 --> 31:27.017
Said, "very good.
That's very good."

31:27.019 --> 31:29.119
So one day,
kids were in the program,

31:29.121 --> 31:31.154
and the ghetto brothers club,
I'm looking at them,

31:31.156 --> 31:33.490
and he sits down in a chair
and he's talking to kids,

31:33.492 --> 31:36.193
and I saw they were on the floor
telling them stories,

31:36.195 --> 31:39.229
and I looked,
I said, "that's wonderful."

31:39.231 --> 31:41.598
And then he talks to the older
people in my community.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.401
He said, "man, there's something
about this guy, I like that."

31:44.403 --> 31:46.303
Charlie, come here.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.939
I think we should
stop the warlords

31:48.941 --> 31:51.441
and put a peacemaker,
that's the man.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.343
"Let's make them into
a peace ambassador."

31:53.345 --> 31:55.245
He became the third staff
of the ghetto brothers.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.014
You're gonna be the ambassador
for peace.

32:00.018 --> 32:01.685
What I knew
about the ghetto brothers,

32:01.687 --> 32:05.222
the first thing was I heard
a lot about karate Charlie.

32:05.224 --> 32:06.690
Everybody kept
hearing about this guy

32:06.692 --> 32:08.425
karate Charlie, right?

32:08.427 --> 32:12.396
Guys in gangs, you had to have
a karate something.

32:12.398 --> 32:15.599
Like in this one gang,
you had a karate Kenny.

32:15.601 --> 32:19.269
I remember him.
Then you had a karate Joe nose.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.538
We had a guy named karate Moe,

32:21.540 --> 32:23.407
but it was all
because of everybody

32:23.409 --> 32:26.176
heard about this guy
named karate Charlie.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.312
The rep for him that we heard

32:28.314 --> 32:30.113
was that he was a bad dude.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.015
He was into karate and stuff.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.084
They were saying, Oh,
he knocked a guy out

32:34.086 --> 32:35.652
by kicking him in the head,

32:35.654 --> 32:38.355
and it was like
an urban legend almost.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.324
Charlie was a warrior.

32:40.326 --> 32:44.328
He lived like
the Japanese Bushido.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.630
You cross me,
you cross my honor?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.432
Yah! You're going down.

32:48.434 --> 32:52.336
Remember, I just came
out of the marine corps.

32:52.338 --> 32:56.273
So what I wanted
was a little marine corps.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.041
Because he brought
the military discipline

32:58.043 --> 32:59.409
to the ghetto brothers.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.078
The ghetto brothers
were not known for guns.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.579
We were known for the hands.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.448
Ghetto brothers were very good
with hands and legs.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.316
So Charlie was the instructor.

33:06.318 --> 33:11.688
They called me karate Charlie,
and they called the founder,

33:11.690 --> 33:15.025
Benji Melendez, the preacher.

33:15.027 --> 33:18.128
Charlie and I were brothers.
I mean, we were very close.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.763
But we were two worlds.

33:19.765 --> 33:25.202
Benji was a yin
while I was a Yang,

33:25.204 --> 33:28.071
black and white, soft and hard,

33:28.073 --> 33:31.274
rain and shine...
we were the opposites.

33:31.276 --> 33:34.277
The yin and Yang? That's true.
That's me and Charlie.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.246
Charlie was...

33:36.248 --> 33:38.248
and I would say, "no, Charlie."

33:38.250 --> 33:41.418
"Come on, Benjy!"
"No, Charlie, come on."

33:41.420 --> 33:43.587
Sometimes it was
the other way around, too.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.689
Charlie had to calm Benjy down.

33:45.691 --> 33:48.425
You know, they kept each other,
you know, at bay.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.661
Yellow Benji,
he was more of a peacemaker.

33:51.663 --> 33:55.132
He was also trying
to let people know,

33:55.134 --> 33:57.768
look, let's stop fighting
amongst ourselves

33:57.770 --> 34:00.037
'cause we're only hurting
each other.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.339
Let's fight the man.
Let's hurt him.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.408
The enemy around the Bronx now
at this very moment

34:04.410 --> 34:06.043
is the policeman.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.811
Yes, this is a warrior thing.
Yes, it is.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.813
And we're here to defend
our brothers and sisters

34:09.815 --> 34:11.648
against people like them.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.784
If you're gonna communicate,
communicate, man.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.719
If you're gonna strike us,
we're gonna strike back.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.754
Right on!

34:42.780 --> 34:45.081
<i>Beyond running the gang,
yellow Benjy</i>

34:45.083 --> 34:47.484
<i>was also the leader
of the ghetto brothers band,</i>

34:47.485 --> 34:51.521
<i>a unique and well-loved
rock and Latin funk outfit.</i>

34:51.523 --> 34:54.591
The band and the gang
were two separate entities.

34:54.592 --> 34:57.227
The talent was definitely there.

34:57.229 --> 35:00.630
It was definitely
a Latin flavor.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.333
It also showed
what clubs could do.

35:03.335 --> 35:05.535
If they took
a different direction.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.644
I tell my brothers, listen,

35:14.646 --> 35:16.279
I notice that when you
talk to people,

35:16.281 --> 35:17.781
some people will listen,
some people don't.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.883
But the idea of music,
my brothers and I,

35:19.885 --> 35:22.219
music caters to all type
of people.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.854
So If you want to get a message,

35:23.856 --> 35:26.623
why don't we put it into song,
watch them listen.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.292
Then when we play the music,
what we always wanted to say

35:29.294 --> 35:31.261
to them and you put it
behind guitars is,

35:31.263 --> 35:34.431
"yo, man, that's me, man.
I live that type of life.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.533
What would be that song for you,
my brother?"

35:36.535 --> 35:38.735
I remember a lot of bongos.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.738
I always, you know,
remember bongo music.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.307
If they were jamming
up the street, you know,

35:44.309 --> 35:45.842
up the hill,
you could hear the music.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.777
When we played music,
why don't we play

35:47.779 --> 35:50.747
a little rock here,
a little Latin here,

35:50.749 --> 35:52.782
a little soul over here?

35:52.784 --> 35:55.552
So you heard Beatles,
sly and the family stone,

35:55.554 --> 35:57.487
Santana, you heard all of that.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.456
So every Friday, the gangs knew

35:59.458 --> 36:01.625
that we had music and a message.

36:21.712 --> 36:25.649
<i>In 1971 despite all efforts
by social workers</i>

36:25.651 --> 36:27.651
<i>and specialized police units,</i>

36:27.653 --> 36:31.421
<i>gang violence had escalated
to a fever pitch,</i>

36:31.423 --> 36:34.291
<i>plunging the streets
into a state of continual war</i>

36:34.293 --> 36:37.627
<i>unlike anything the city
had ever experienced before.</i>

36:37.629 --> 36:40.697
Drugs was a big factor
in gangs going haywire,

36:40.699 --> 36:42.732
lust for power, lust for turf.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.802
The wars with street gangs
could start from something

36:45.804 --> 36:49.806
that could be just as silly
as stepping on somebody's boots.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.442
Wars could get started
just from a rumor.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.377
Territory was a big issue.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.813
I had heard of some dudes
just getting popped

36:56.815 --> 36:58.748
from running down
the wrong block.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.383
The garbage can is here.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.385
If you go past that garbage can,

37:02.387 --> 37:04.654
although It's the same block

37:04.656 --> 37:07.257
in the same neighborhood,
it could be a war.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.593
The devil's rebels
is fighting gang,

37:09.595 --> 37:12.329
and on this night,
they found their first victims

37:12.331 --> 37:14.431
outside a corner grocery store.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.633
What looks like child's play
is not.

37:16.635 --> 37:19.436
In the middle of all this,
a young man was stabbed.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.371
It was the thing
about conquering.

37:21.373 --> 37:24.241
You go to their turf,
beat the hell out of these guys,

37:24.243 --> 37:26.509
and come back again and again
until they were forced...

37:26.511 --> 37:29.646
either they break up
or become part of the majority.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.915
So they did it
through barbarian style,

37:31.917 --> 37:33.483
warrior, vikings.

37:33.485 --> 37:36.353
They tried to take over
one of my divisions.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.788
They didn't quite make it,
and we killed two of they guys.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.624
They tried to burn down
my clubhouse.

37:40.626 --> 37:43.693
We killed two of they guys,
and five of they guys rolled up

37:43.695 --> 37:45.428
on one of the savage nomads.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.731
Know what they told him?
"We gonna give you hell, baby.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.333
"We gonna give you hell."
And they didn't even kill him.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.640
There were big gang wars

37:56.642 --> 37:58.842
between the savage skulls,
black spades,

37:58.844 --> 38:01.278
between the savage skulls,
the bachelors.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.346
Back then,
nobody had cell phones,

38:03.348 --> 38:04.714
but It's like drums...
you hear it.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.616
You hear it all over the place.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.586
You know, one way or another,
you hear who's beating who.

38:09.588 --> 38:11.688
The violence was everywhere.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.523
You could see the fights
across the street.

38:13.525 --> 38:15.425
You could hear the shots
in the nighttime.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.527
What made life interesting
in the South Bronx

38:17.529 --> 38:21.298
for these young guys
was fighting, was killing.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.966
"Yo, I killed a dude today."
"What'd you do?"

38:22.968 --> 38:25.468
"I stabbed him in the throat.
What'd you do, man?"

38:25.470 --> 38:28.838
"Yo, I shot that dude."
"I burned this guy."

38:28.840 --> 38:31.374
You hear this,
and this is every day.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.609
It was a lawless time.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.611
If somebody got killed
on Hewitt place,

38:34.613 --> 38:36.513
their body stayed there.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.782
An ambulance wouldn't dare
come and pick that body up.

38:38.784 --> 38:41.051
The police came in riot gear
to take that body out there,

38:41.053 --> 38:42.919
and they didn't do
an investigation.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.454
They took that body out of there
as quick as possible

38:44.456 --> 38:45.588
because they didn't
want to get it.

38:45.590 --> 38:46.990
There's no ambulance coming.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.725
There are no ambulances,
all right?

38:48.727 --> 38:50.660
How long It's gonna take, man?

38:50.662 --> 38:53.863
The '70s when the drug trade
came in the city,

38:53.865 --> 38:57.067
that totally changed
the whole vibe on how we rumble.

38:57.069 --> 38:58.768
Now It's serious.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.837
Now we're gonna start
shooting at each other.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.640
In the '70s, you had firepower.

39:03.642 --> 39:05.975
You had some gangs
with arsenals.

39:05.977 --> 39:10.714
I've seen .357s.
I've seen 12-guage shotguns.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.749
I've seen dynamite
on the street.

39:12.751 --> 39:16.086
I've seen all this.
You'd be surprised, man.

39:16.088 --> 39:18.388
Pretty soon, they're gonna
steal the damn atom bomb.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.629
<i>As the bloodshed continued,</i>

39:26.631 --> 39:29.132
<i>the ghetto brothers worked
fervently to mediate peace</i>

39:29.134 --> 39:31.901
<i>amongst the ever-growing web
of turf battles.</i>

39:31.903 --> 39:34.771
A lot of things was happening
in the Bronx at the same time.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.073
We felt the whole world
was going through these changes.

39:37.075 --> 39:41.077
I said
this is getting out of hand.

39:41.079 --> 39:44.781
You know, we were pretty much
hurting fighting each other

39:44.783 --> 39:47.917
instead of going
against the real enemy.

39:47.919 --> 39:52.622
Benjy, he tried, man.
He tried to let us know that.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.425
They were like the club
that would be the mediators,

39:55.427 --> 39:57.994
you know, stopped a lot of us
from going out there

39:57.996 --> 40:00.663
and going ballistic on a whole
lot of wars, you know?

40:00.665 --> 40:03.466
I would sit down and reason
with a lot of these brothers.

40:03.468 --> 40:05.702
"Come here, guys.
Savage skulls, come here."

40:05.704 --> 40:08.505
"Savage nomads, come here.
Black spades, come over here."

40:08.507 --> 40:10.440
That's the way we used to talk.

40:10.442 --> 40:13.843
"It doesn't make any sense
with this turf thing, guys."

40:13.845 --> 40:18.181
It's us against the government.
It's not me against you.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.916
You are not hurting me.

40:19.918 --> 40:23.086
You're not the one
that's keeping me down.

40:23.088 --> 40:27.157
I don't have to fight you.
You're not the problem.

40:27.159 --> 40:28.892
"Yo, brothers, come on, man."

40:28.894 --> 40:30.727
"Nah,
but you don't understand, man!"

40:30.729 --> 40:32.695
He came into my turf
with his colors, man!

40:32.697 --> 40:34.664
"And he was just trying
to tell me..."

40:34.666 --> 40:37.000
because colors?

40:37.002 --> 40:39.002
Come on, guys,
think what I'm gonna say.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.938
Colors is gonna
make you go insane?

40:45.476 --> 40:48.111
<i>On December 8,
a series of events transpired</i>

40:48.113 --> 40:51.448
<i>that rocked the ghetto brothers
and the rest of the Bronx.</i>

40:51.450 --> 40:53.216
<i>As a result,
the outcome would come</i>

40:53.218 --> 40:56.152
<i>to change gang life
in New York City forever.</i>

40:56.154 --> 40:59.589
They came to the storefront
and said

40:59.591 --> 41:03.860
there was going to be a fight
at the bottom of the stairs.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.496
"Benjy, three gangs are coming
from Southern boulevard..."

41:06.498 --> 41:10.200
bongos, black spades,
and seven immortals.

41:10.202 --> 41:13.536
"They want to get
the Roman kings."

41:13.538 --> 41:18.741
Benji said, "let black Ben go,
Cornell go."

41:18.743 --> 41:20.944
"Benji, you got your job
cut out for you."

41:20.946 --> 41:22.879
You're gonna get me
the president, vice president,

41:22.881 --> 41:24.214
warlords of those three gangs.

41:24.216 --> 41:26.082
Bring them here
so we can broker a peace.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.618
"Bring them here, take some
ghetto brothers with you."

41:28.620 --> 41:29.886
So he left.

41:29.888 --> 41:31.988
He went with playboy

41:31.990 --> 41:34.924
and a few of the younger
ghetto brothers.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.660
We came down the stairs, right?

41:37.662 --> 41:38.862
And we stopped there,

41:38.864 --> 41:41.498
and there was about 13
to 20 of us.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.867
And then when we looked down,
we seen them,

41:43.869 --> 41:46.536
and you couldn't
even see the corner.

41:46.538 --> 41:49.672
That's how many there were,
and when we got to the bottom

41:49.674 --> 41:52.075
of the stairs
and they could've seen us,

41:52.077 --> 41:53.776
there was only about nine of us.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.179
That's when Benji came out,
and Benji said...

41:56.181 --> 41:58.848
he took a step forward,
and he said,

41:58.850 --> 42:01.684
"listen, brother,
we're here to talk peace."

42:01.686 --> 42:05.655
And the guy who came out,
he said, "peace, shit."

42:05.657 --> 42:07.524
That's when the guy
pull out the machete.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.626
That's when they had us
all surrounded.

42:09.628 --> 42:12.762
Benji said, "take, brother..."
Because there was too many.

42:12.764 --> 42:16.666
So I heard a noise,
you know, pow, like a slap,

42:16.668 --> 42:19.269
and Benji had got hit
in the stomach, and he tripped.

42:19.271 --> 42:23.573
At that time was a time
when they were killing,

42:23.575 --> 42:28.611
killing, killing, killing,
and Cornell wasn't recognized.

42:28.613 --> 42:30.880
They recognized violence,

42:30.882 --> 42:33.583
and they recognized somebody
that'd throw a punch.

42:45.596 --> 42:49.933
It was a moment in time
that could have been avoided.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.835
If I could just turn back
the hands of time,

42:52.837 --> 42:55.104
this wouldn't ever
have happened.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.774
And I looked at my brothers
today, my real brothers,

42:57.776 --> 43:00.910
Says, "think about it...
there was that fateful day"

43:00.912 --> 43:04.147
that I sent him
to bring peace."

43:04.149 --> 43:05.982
My brother looked at me, said,

43:05.984 --> 43:07.951
"Benji, but you didn't know
what was gonna..."

43:07.953 --> 43:09.986
"no, you're right, I didn't know
what was gonna happen."

43:09.988 --> 43:11.321
I didn't know the fate,

43:11.323 --> 43:14.924
"but it was my decision
to send him."

43:18.996 --> 43:20.730
That was one of the worst days

43:20.732 --> 43:23.166
in South Bronx history
when he got murdered.

43:23.168 --> 43:26.102
The word on the street was
he was trying to make peace,

43:26.104 --> 43:28.204
and he was murdered
trying to make peace,

43:28.206 --> 43:31.341
and basically after that,
the South Bronx,

43:31.343 --> 43:33.109
fort Apache was out of control.

43:33.111 --> 43:35.178
When this tragedy happened,

43:35.180 --> 43:38.247
they went to war and even got
many gangs to move

43:38.249 --> 43:40.717
against the seven immortals
and the black spades.

43:40.719 --> 43:45.755
Every gang in my neighborhood
at least were so mad

43:45.757 --> 43:47.123
that they killed this guy,

43:47.125 --> 43:48.858
they were running
through the streets.

43:48.860 --> 43:51.861
They were burning everything.
I mean, pandemonium hit.

43:51.863 --> 43:53.997
Black spades
wasn't gonna back down.

43:53.999 --> 43:56.032
If they was gonna
fully get attacked.

43:56.034 --> 43:58.101
Then there was the time when
the spade leaders,

43:58.103 --> 44:00.803
all of them said hell with it,
get ready for war.

44:00.805 --> 44:03.940
How rumors spread.
How news spread.

44:03.942 --> 44:07.043
There was not a gang
in the whole of New York

44:07.045 --> 44:08.845
that was not aware
what's happening.

44:08.847 --> 44:10.079
I put out a bulletin,

44:10.081 --> 44:12.682
and I started calling
ghetto brothers,

44:12.684 --> 44:14.817
all the ghetto brothers.

44:14.819 --> 44:17.687
Charlie wanted to get
the ghetto brothers

44:17.689 --> 44:19.055
to mobilize
for the biggest bloodbath

44:19.057 --> 44:20.757
in the history of New York.

44:20.759 --> 44:22.792
We lost a member,
they viciously murdered him

44:22.794 --> 44:23.860
out there in the street.

44:23.862 --> 44:25.795
Now It's an eye for an eye

44:25.797 --> 44:27.330
because another ghetto brother
loses a life,

44:27.332 --> 44:30.066
six of whoever,
whether they his kids,

44:30.068 --> 44:32.068
his mother, his father,
they lose their lives.

44:32.070 --> 44:34.804
Who was it that took
the lives of two of your...

44:34.806 --> 44:36.039
some dude out there.

44:36.041 --> 44:39.208
At the time, I was...
I was blind.

44:39.210 --> 44:41.878
And I said, no,
I'm gonna make everyone pay.

44:41.880 --> 44:45.748
That's when I said I'm going to
just start killing, you know?

44:45.750 --> 44:48.384
Watch. The sword is sharp.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.453
Look, razor-sharp.

44:50.455 --> 44:52.455
And Benji kept saying,
"but, Charlie,

44:52.457 --> 44:54.691
that's not the way,"
I said, "I don't care.

44:54.693 --> 44:57.860
At the moment, I don't care."

45:02.399 --> 45:04.167
My business at the point

45:04.169 --> 45:08.037
was to quell down the anger
that was coming up.

45:08.039 --> 45:09.972
He said,
"let's go see Gwendolyn."

45:09.974 --> 45:12.108
That's Cornell's mother.

45:12.110 --> 45:15.478
Let's go see her, show respect.

45:15.480 --> 45:18.247
I said, "when I walk in there
and tell her"

45:18.249 --> 45:21.884
I've called New Jersey,
I've called Connecticut,

45:21.886 --> 45:25.254
I've called all the boroughs,
I've called everybody...

45:25.256 --> 45:27.957
"I've got an army outside."

45:27.959 --> 45:31.360
I walked in
like a mother fucking cock

45:31.362 --> 45:36.499
ready to fight, spurs gleaming.

45:36.501 --> 45:38.468
I strutted over.

45:38.470 --> 45:40.269
I kissed her.

45:40.271 --> 45:44.807
I said, "mom," I said,
"I've got an army outside."

45:44.809 --> 45:49.112
And she said, "Charlie,
my son died for peace."

45:50.280 --> 45:52.482
Said, "God damn."

46:02.426 --> 46:04.160
I looked at his mother.

46:04.162 --> 46:06.496
She didn't want
to see other children die.

46:06.498 --> 46:10.166
It just confirmed what I said,
you know?

46:10.168 --> 46:13.236
So he understood after
what she... "please."

46:13.238 --> 46:15.772
You know, Charlie,
that could be our moms, man.

46:15.774 --> 46:17.406
That's an omen.
It's your mother talking.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.175
She's my Mami talking to you.

46:19.177 --> 46:22.078
"My son died for peace,
Charlie."

46:24.181 --> 46:26.949
I walked back to the storefront.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.985
Storefront was like this
with media,

46:28.987 --> 46:33.823
cameras waiting for me to say
that the Bronx

46:33.825 --> 46:37.293
was gonna be bathed in blood.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.562
We could have gone
in the chronicles of New York

46:39.564 --> 46:41.531
to be the most notorious gang.

46:41.533 --> 46:43.299
We even allowed our influence

46:43.301 --> 46:45.368
to use all these gangs
to do our bidding.

46:45.370 --> 46:49.238
All they were waiting was this,
like the Roman empire.

46:49.240 --> 46:52.041
All the gangs
were there at 174th.

46:52.043 --> 46:54.410
They were waiting
for the big war.

46:54.412 --> 46:58.281
We said, no,
we're not gonna do anything.

46:58.283 --> 46:59.849
I said,
"brothers, don't you know this?"

46:59.851 --> 47:01.951
Look at these newspaper people.
Look!

47:01.953 --> 47:03.986
As soon as I said no,
they stopped writing.

47:03.988 --> 47:05.321
This is what they want to see.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.190
They want to tell the world

47:07.192 --> 47:09.525
that we're a bunch of savages,
that we're killers!

47:09.527 --> 47:11.494
We're not gonna give you
the satisfaction.

47:11.496 --> 47:14.263
"Send our message...
hands down, no war!"

47:14.265 --> 47:18.568
No, we ain't doing nobody.

47:18.570 --> 47:23.406
Gotta figure out
how we're gonna do this.

47:23.408 --> 47:25.474
We're gonna have a peace treaty.

47:30.180 --> 47:34.517
<i>Word of the murder and fear of
reprisal spread like wildfire.</i>

47:34.519 --> 47:36.586
<i>At the insistence
of the ghetto brothers,</i>

47:36.588 --> 47:38.921
<i>representatives of over 40
of the city's</i>

47:38.923 --> 47:42.091
<i>most notorious gangs
met at the hoe Avenue</i>

47:42.093 --> 47:43.960
<i>boys' club in the Bronx.</i>

47:43.962 --> 47:48.297
So I got them while
they were still in revenge mode.

47:48.299 --> 47:50.867
They wanted to see war
and blood.

47:50.869 --> 47:54.003
I said this is the time
to do it, right now.

47:54.005 --> 47:56.138
Said, "listen,
this is what's going on."

47:56.140 --> 47:59.475
They killed my brother Benji."
"What you want me to do?"

47:59.477 --> 48:01.010
I said, "I don't want you
to do anything."

48:01.012 --> 48:03.012
I want you to come to
a peace treaty."

48:03.014 --> 48:04.547
"I don't do peace."

48:04.549 --> 48:07.116
I said, "well,
you're gonna do peace now, bro."

48:07.118 --> 48:09.552
I said, "you do peace
or we're gonna take you out."

48:09.554 --> 48:11.387
"Who's you?"

48:11.389 --> 48:15.191
"I'm the spades. I'm the skulls.
I'm the nomads."

48:15.193 --> 48:17.293
And I to started running it off,

48:17.295 --> 48:21.030
everyone that said
that they'd stand behind me.

48:21.032 --> 48:22.498
This is hoe Avenue.

48:22.500 --> 48:25.668
This is the spot,
Madison square boys' club,

48:25.670 --> 48:27.670
here where history was made.

48:27.672 --> 48:30.072
It was here
that the gangs got together

48:30.074 --> 48:32.508
to have the biggest peace treaty
in the history of the Bronx.

48:32.510 --> 48:33.976
President young sinners.

48:33.978 --> 48:35.311
Vice president
of the young sinners.

48:35.313 --> 48:36.979
Vice president of young saints.

48:36.981 --> 48:38.047
President of young cobras.

48:38.049 --> 48:40.116
War council of young saints.

48:40.118 --> 48:42.351
It was fantastic
how it all happened,

48:42.353 --> 48:44.387
and they just sent
just their main leaders.

48:44.389 --> 48:46.222
Come on, it was too many guys.

48:46.224 --> 48:48.257
So it was all the leaders
that were there.

48:48.259 --> 48:51.327
At the treaty,
I was a young person

48:51.329 --> 48:54.931
sitting in the background
listening to my head leaders

48:54.933 --> 48:56.666
talking what needs to be done.

48:56.668 --> 48:59.168
Basically it was just like
the movie "the warriors."

48:59.170 --> 49:01.137
Everybody was tense
because nobody knew

49:01.139 --> 49:04.040
when it was gonna jump off,
but it went well, though.

49:04.042 --> 49:06.309
After while,
everybody started talking.

49:06.311 --> 49:08.945
Everybody calmed down
and just got into,

49:08.947 --> 49:12.248
you know, what the purpose was,
and it turned out good.

49:12.250 --> 49:14.951
People were just bringing out
atonement

49:14.953 --> 49:18.354
to say, you know, come on,
let's slow this thing down.

49:18.356 --> 49:20.623
Let's bring this peace treaty
into play.

49:20.625 --> 49:23.559
<i>One by one, gang leaders
stated their grievances</i>

49:23.561 --> 49:28.030
<i>with the intention of squashing
prior beefs once and for all.</i>

49:28.032 --> 49:30.433
When we have static, man,
we sell out among ourselves,

49:30.435 --> 49:33.002
man, because, wow, we got to
live in this district.

49:33.004 --> 49:35.037
The whitey
don't come down here, man,

49:35.039 --> 49:36.706
and live in the fucked-up
houses, man.

49:36.708 --> 49:39.141
The whitey don't come
down here, man, and have

49:39.143 --> 49:42.545
all the fucked-up no heat
in the fucking wintertime.

49:42.547 --> 49:45.014
We do, Jack, so therefore,
like, wow,

49:45.016 --> 49:47.383
we got to make it a better place
to live, you understand?

49:49.653 --> 49:51.520
The idea of the meeting was to
expose the ones

49:51.522 --> 49:53.356
who murdered black Benji.

49:53.358 --> 49:55.558
Now in those days,
you can't say, "you do it."

49:55.560 --> 49:57.727
We didn't say that,
but If you saw that film,

49:57.729 --> 49:59.628
you look at the guys
that were sitting in front,

49:59.630 --> 50:01.998
those are all the guys
that murdered my boy.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.499
And I'm looking at them.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.534
I say, "yo, my brothers, man."

50:05.536 --> 50:07.603
One of the guys, a president
of the club, came up to me,

50:07.605 --> 50:10.673
"Benjy, I don't want to die.
Please, I don't want to die."

50:10.675 --> 50:12.475
"You're not gonna die,
my brother."

50:12.477 --> 50:14.210
See, that's power.

50:14.212 --> 50:16.412
You don't want us to become
a gang again, right?

50:16.414 --> 50:18.447
Because I know you.
You was up in the meeting.

50:18.449 --> 50:20.416
And you told me, "Benjy,
I want to get out alive."

50:20.418 --> 50:22.018
Didn't you tell me that?

50:22.020 --> 50:24.053
"Benjy,
I want to get out alive."

50:24.055 --> 50:25.788
That's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna get out alive.

50:25.790 --> 50:27.289
Benji didn't get out alive.

50:27.291 --> 50:29.358
The thing is we're not
a gang anymore.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.760
We're an organization.

50:30.762 --> 50:32.128
We want to help black
and Puerto Ricans

50:32.130 --> 50:33.696
to live in a better environment.

50:33.698 --> 50:35.531
<i>At the end of
this historic summit,</i>

50:35.533 --> 50:37.466
<i>an inter-gang peace treaty
was signed</i>

50:37.468 --> 50:39.235
<i>by every attending leader.</i>

50:39.237 --> 50:41.137
<i>This momentous turning point</i>

50:41.139 --> 50:44.140
<i>gave the first real promise
of the long needed peace</i>

50:44.142 --> 50:46.108
<i>the system
had failed to produce.</i>

51:08.532 --> 51:14.170
Peace after the treaty
came instantaneous.

51:14.172 --> 51:16.205
The following day,
the day afterwards,

51:16.207 --> 51:17.673
you didn't feel the hostility

51:17.675 --> 51:20.309
you did prior
to black Benji's death.

51:20.311 --> 51:22.511
Things were just waning down.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.647
It meant people
was trying to bring

51:24.649 --> 51:29.452
a different type of vibration,
frequency to their community.

51:29.454 --> 51:31.587
A definite attitude shift.

51:31.589 --> 51:35.191
A lot of the people
that were at the meeting,

51:35.193 --> 51:38.761
they decided, hey, you know,
we're just killing ourselves.

51:38.763 --> 51:40.496
We're hurting
our own neighborhoods.

51:40.498 --> 51:42.364
We better put a stop to this.

51:42.366 --> 51:43.799
Wars had stopped.

51:43.801 --> 51:47.336
It was here and there,
but wars had stopped.

51:47.338 --> 51:50.239
It was definitely
a different lifestyle

51:50.241 --> 51:53.809
where when we gang busted,
we stood in the same spot.

51:53.811 --> 51:55.711
We stood in the same area.

51:55.713 --> 51:58.514
We couldn't go that way.
We couldn't go this way.

51:58.516 --> 52:00.216
We couldn't go that way.

52:00.218 --> 52:01.650
Once the peace treaty happened,

52:01.652 --> 52:03.519
people was being invited
in areas

52:03.521 --> 52:06.288
where they used to never
even stepped into that area.

52:06.290 --> 52:08.757
People would go
to certain parties

52:08.759 --> 52:10.659
that you would never even
step in that party

52:10.661 --> 52:12.595
or you don't know
what would happen.

52:12.597 --> 52:14.396
We're having house jams.

52:14.398 --> 52:16.499
We're having basement parties.
It was different.

52:16.501 --> 52:19.401
Now we're able to go here,
go there,

52:19.403 --> 52:21.837
meet more people,
unite with people.

52:31.782 --> 52:34.617
<i>Peaceful block parties hosted
by the ghetto brothers</i>

52:34.619 --> 52:37.520
<i>and other local gangs
began to multiply,</i>

52:37.522 --> 52:40.156
<i>helping to dissolve
the invisible turf boundaries</i>

52:40.158 --> 52:41.924
<i>that had dominated
for years prior.</i>

52:46.530 --> 52:49.365
Here's where the whole thing
started to change.

52:49.367 --> 52:50.799
We invited many gang members.

52:50.801 --> 52:52.635
"Guys, If you guys haven't
been to a party,"

52:52.637 --> 52:55.404
why don't you come out?
Gonna have a party.

52:55.406 --> 52:58.307
"We're gonna play out there." And
they would invite other gang members

52:58.309 --> 52:59.942
to have jam sessions with them.

52:59.944 --> 53:02.411
All over the city,
you were invited

53:02.413 --> 53:04.613
to come to these jam sessions
and jam with them.

53:04.615 --> 53:06.282
You can bring your instrument.

53:06.284 --> 53:08.450
You could, you know,
do whatever it is you do.

53:08.452 --> 53:13.322
This is the famous 163rd St.
This was ghetto brothers city.

53:13.324 --> 53:15.925
All the people came down here
to hear the ghetto brothers.

53:15.927 --> 53:17.860
Every Friday and Saturday,
we would gonna have a party.

53:17.862 --> 53:19.528
You had gangs
from different areas

53:19.530 --> 53:20.863
to down come down
and check us out.

53:20.865 --> 53:22.898
This block
was literally full with people.

53:22.900 --> 53:24.800
They would call out big parties.

53:24.802 --> 53:29.271
You'd see like 100
to 200 guys hanging out.

53:29.273 --> 53:31.407
It was massive. Scary, too.

53:31.409 --> 53:33.209
When the ghetto brothers
had the parties,

53:33.211 --> 53:34.476
they all mingled.

53:34.478 --> 53:36.212
Everybody mingled...

53:36.214 --> 53:39.415
savage skulls, black spades,
the turbans,

53:39.417 --> 53:41.750
everybody because
we were having a good time.

53:41.752 --> 53:43.586
People were dancing,

53:43.588 --> 53:47.790
and you saw turbans,
and you saw skulls.

53:47.792 --> 53:50.226
What was the common thing?

53:50.228 --> 53:53.896
I said, "look,
I put the flags up there."

53:53.898 --> 53:55.998
They'd see
the Puerto Rican flag.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.967
They'd see
the black liberation flag.

53:57.969 --> 54:00.336
"See, brothers?
This is us, man."

54:00.338 --> 54:02.471
It's about dropping
the attitude.

54:02.473 --> 54:04.273
"We're all one people here."

54:04.275 --> 54:07.776
It's almost like a... A relief,

54:07.778 --> 54:11.580
you know, 'cause the chaos
in the streets and the mayhem

54:11.582 --> 54:13.515
and everything
that was going on,

54:13.517 --> 54:18.020
this was kind of like
a breather to say...

54:18.022 --> 54:19.822
you know, finally, some peace.

54:19.824 --> 54:22.524
You see, when you saw
that friendly attitude there,

54:22.526 --> 54:25.527
they brought that back
to their club, you understand?

54:25.529 --> 54:27.029
So every Friday,
they were looking forward

54:27.031 --> 54:28.631
to getting back together again.

54:28.633 --> 54:30.866
One of the things
the ghetto brothers

54:30.868 --> 54:34.336
made us realize...
I'll put it very simply...

54:34.338 --> 54:35.604
self-worth.

54:35.606 --> 54:37.740
When you...
whether it be a guitar

54:37.742 --> 54:40.676
or a saxophone
or an instrument or a bongo,

54:40.678 --> 54:44.513
whatever it is that you can do
to add to the flavor

54:44.515 --> 54:48.050
of what was going on,
it kind of gave you a revelation

54:48.052 --> 54:50.286
that, hey, I can actually
do something besides,

54:50.288 --> 54:52.321
you know,
stomping somebody's brains out.

54:52.323 --> 54:54.857
I can actually do something
besides stabbing or shooting

54:54.859 --> 54:57.059
or besides this other stuff
we've been doing.

54:57.061 --> 54:59.628
There's something inside
of me that's positive.

55:08.805 --> 55:10.873
<i>In the years that followed,
outlaw gangs</i>

55:10.875 --> 55:13.042
<i>transformed into DJ crews.</i>

55:13.044 --> 55:15.611
<i>A major shift in attitude
made way</i>

55:15.613 --> 55:17.413
<i>for this emerging culture</i>

55:17.415 --> 55:19.815
<i>that was taking hold
of the youth in the Bronx.</i>

55:19.817 --> 55:21.850
I always thought there
was a connection

55:21.852 --> 55:23.652
between gang culture
and hip-hop

55:23.654 --> 55:28.524
because from what I learned
that either you was a DJ,

55:28.526 --> 55:32.494
an MC, a break dancer,
or a graffiti artist,

55:32.496 --> 55:33.929
once upon a time,

55:33.931 --> 55:36.332
one of them members
was part of a gang.

55:36.334 --> 55:40.502
Now you can express yourself
and show what is it

55:40.504 --> 55:42.738
that you have on the other side
from what you used to be.

55:42.740 --> 55:48.577
So we saw the translation
between the violent attitude

55:48.579 --> 55:51.347
to something positive,
but at the same time,

55:51.349 --> 55:52.948
you see the intimidation.

55:52.950 --> 55:56.919
Competition is always
and has always been there.

55:56.921 --> 55:59.488
The battle
when they battle on the mic,

55:59.490 --> 56:01.023
when they compete
against each other,

56:01.025 --> 56:02.758
they're battling,
when they're dancing

56:02.760 --> 56:04.993
against each other,
they're battling.

56:04.995 --> 56:08.397
It was more like
challenging to dance now

56:08.399 --> 56:10.733
and not to fight,

56:10.735 --> 56:13.769
and whoever could dance
the best won the fight.

56:13.771 --> 56:16.972
Colors were starting to come
off, and little by little,

56:16.974 --> 56:19.775
that's when the music
started to come into the deal.

56:19.777 --> 56:22.511
When the gang scene
started fading down,

56:22.513 --> 56:25.514
it was the DJs who started
becoming the stars

56:25.516 --> 56:28.951
in the community,
the leaders in the community.

56:28.953 --> 56:31.820
<i>The Bronx's own DJ Kool Herc,</i>

56:31.822 --> 56:34.089
<i>considered the founding father
of hip-hop,</i>

56:34.091 --> 56:37.092
<i>played a crucial role
in redirecting gang energy</i>

56:37.094 --> 56:39.695
<i>into this new
and growing movement.</i>

56:39.697 --> 56:42.798
Herc had the right
timing of presenting something.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.635
The same people
that was involved with gangs,

56:46.637 --> 56:48.804
they felt that they
want to be relieved.

56:48.806 --> 56:50.706
They want to have
some of this dance.

56:50.708 --> 56:55.077
Herc took it upon himself
to become their new pied Piper.

56:55.079 --> 56:58.514
It was like, hey,
this is what we want to hear,

56:58.516 --> 57:01.450
and we don't want to hear what
was being played on the radio,

57:01.452 --> 57:03.652
what was being played
in the clubs.

57:03.654 --> 57:05.988
We were trying to reach out
for the beats,

57:05.990 --> 57:08.857
that raw essence, heavy drums.

57:08.859 --> 57:12.494
Herc started something
his enemies didn't want to stop.

57:12.496 --> 57:15.831
It came in the form of music.
They gravitate to this.

57:15.833 --> 57:17.900
This is something
that is theirs.

57:17.902 --> 57:19.835
That hadn't come in a long time.

57:19.837 --> 57:22.070
They didn't worry
If you were black, you're white.

57:22.072 --> 57:23.939
Got this common thing
right here.

57:23.941 --> 57:26.074
He was God. He didn't...

57:26.076 --> 57:28.777
Herc didn't come out with
no little tinker toy speakers.

57:28.779 --> 57:31.847
Herc came out with the big boys.

57:31.849 --> 57:34.783
See, I got some big boys
behind me right now.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.785
Herc came out with the big boys!

57:41.090 --> 57:43.759
Later on, some of these people
that was coming

57:43.761 --> 57:46.195
to all his parties
turn out to be DJs...

57:46.197 --> 57:49.765
flash, grand master Caz,

57:49.767 --> 57:53.168
mean gene,
remember the I brothers,

57:53.170 --> 57:57.072
started seeing Aj,
the I brothers with Theodore,

57:57.074 --> 58:01.009
breakout, baron, bam.

58:07.917 --> 58:11.220
<i>There was no closer connection
between the gangs of the Bronx</i>

58:11.222 --> 58:13.155
<i>and this budding
hip-hop movement</i>

58:13.157 --> 58:14.923
<i>than Afrika Bambaataa,</i>

58:14.925 --> 58:17.159
<i>who had personally taken it
upon himself</i>

58:17.161 --> 58:19.127
<i>to convert
the fearsome black spades</i>

58:19.129 --> 58:20.896
<i>into the Zulu nation.</i>

58:20.898 --> 58:23.665
<i>This was the first
worldwide force</i>

58:23.667 --> 58:26.201
<i>to promote positivity
through music.</i>

58:26.203 --> 58:28.036
When I started
the universal Zulu nation,

58:28.038 --> 58:31.874
I already had an army of street
gangs that was with me.

58:31.876 --> 58:33.842
I had a lot of pull and power,

58:33.844 --> 58:36.144
so If I was with
the black spades,

58:36.146 --> 58:38.847
I might go and hang
with the nomads

58:38.849 --> 58:41.049
and some of the javelins
and some of the groups

58:41.051 --> 58:43.051
that might not even
like each other.

58:43.053 --> 58:45.554
I had a type of persuasion

58:45.556 --> 58:47.589
with many of the other leaders
in groups.

58:47.591 --> 58:50.192
Bambaataa had great influence
amongst so many people.

58:50.194 --> 58:54.096
They believed in him,
and If you was a person

58:54.098 --> 58:57.833
that come from Bronx river
or within the soundview section,

58:57.835 --> 58:59.835
everybody was coming
to their parties.

58:59.837 --> 59:02.538
And he accepted you.
He didn't put you down.

59:02.540 --> 59:05.607
It took a lot of work,
took a lot of speaking,

59:05.609 --> 59:08.744
a lot of teaching,
a lot of organizing,

59:08.746 --> 59:11.113
speaking to the brothers
and sisters

59:11.115 --> 59:13.682
to get away from
that certain mentality.

59:13.684 --> 59:16.151
The purpose of the Zulu nation
at that time

59:16.153 --> 59:19.221
was to show that
we can turn ourself around

59:19.223 --> 59:20.956
from negative to positive,

59:20.958 --> 59:22.958
and we was doing
that through music.

59:22.960 --> 59:27.996
Our slogan became "peace,
unity, love, and having fun."

59:27.998 --> 59:30.933
Lot of Zulu nation running
in Monroe now. Yeah.

59:30.935 --> 59:33.235
A lot of Zulu nation
in Monroe and Stevenson

59:33.237 --> 59:36.338
and in all these housing
development projects.

59:36.340 --> 59:39.908
Soon, the Zulu nation
gonna take over the world.

59:39.910 --> 59:42.644
Is the Bronx in the house?!

59:42.646 --> 59:45.948
Is everybody in the house?!
Hit it!

59:47.284 --> 59:49.251
Are we gonna get loose in here?!

59:55.191 --> 59:57.960
Say z-u-l-u!

59:57.962 --> 01:00:00.162
- That's the way to say...
- Zulu!

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:02.664
Z-u-l-u!

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:05.300
- That's the way to say...
- Zulu!

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:15.177
Another thing
that is not mentioned

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:17.879
is a style change happened.

01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:23.619
Like, it wasn't just
break dancing, graffiti, MC, DJ.

01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:26.321
A fifth thing included
was style.

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:28.357
You had to now have style.

01:00:28.359 --> 01:00:31.693
You didn't want to walk around
with dirty clothes anymore

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.896
or, you know, the patches
on their back

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:37.132
because that wasn't attracting

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:39.234
the type of girls
that they wanted.

01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:42.404
It was just
a whole mindset change.

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:44.773
Well, let me talk about girls

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:47.175
because I think women played
a big part in it

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.977
because
there was always girls around.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.846
Even the black spades
had their girls.

01:00:50.848 --> 01:00:52.781
Everybody had their girls,
so basically,

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.282
once you could talk
to the girls,

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:56.018
then you knew it was safe.

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:59.688
So it kind of like opened up
a whole new area

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:01.923
of South Bronx for us
when you can talk to girls

01:01:01.925 --> 01:01:03.158
that you couldn't talk
to before.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.793
That's a big deal.

01:01:04.795 --> 01:01:06.828
Oh, you can talk
to this Puerto Rican girl now.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.864
'Cause you couldn't talk to
a Puerto Rican girl back then,

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:11.733
not and be black
in the South Bronx and live.

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:13.035
It wasn't happening.

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.906
We didn't even know
we was creating anything.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:21.343
We just wanted to have
something that was hours.

01:01:21.345 --> 01:01:24.079
Music calms the savage beast.

01:01:24.081 --> 01:01:29.384
We would be the pied pipers,
just calm the storm.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:31.853
Music had definitely calmed
the savage beast

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:34.856
because how many times

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:39.394
you may be in the motion
of something that feels so tense

01:01:39.396 --> 01:01:42.130
and you just hit that one tune,

01:01:42.132 --> 01:01:44.099
and it would relieve everybody.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.475
I think It's important
that whoever sees this

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:56.778
knows that we have grown,
and, yes,

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.815
there was a lot of negative,
and a lot of shit happened,

01:01:59.817 --> 01:02:02.851
but a lot of us own homes,
fancy cars,

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:05.921
two and three hikes,
have good-paying jobs.

01:02:05.923 --> 01:02:08.423
And I think It's important
that whoever sees this

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:11.460
knows that there is hope,
that we could do this,

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:12.994
and it could be positive.

01:02:12.996 --> 01:02:15.363
They say history is not made
by individuals.

01:02:15.365 --> 01:02:16.898
I disagree.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.168
I think
It's a confluence of factors.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.438
It's the social context
of the time,

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.208
the economic context
of the time,

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.376
and the individual dream.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:31.379
What was so powerful
about our generation

01:02:31.381 --> 01:02:33.215
is we caused movement.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:36.151
We had to take from nothing
and make something.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:39.488
I believe that we were making
a statement to society,

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.389
so to speak,
that had forgotten about us,

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:44.392
that we have worth
because we did have big fun.

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:46.762
Even though we were poor
and we didn't have a lot,

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.296
we had fun.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.132
You know,
we made a way to have fun,

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:52.300
and we made a way
to feel like we counted,

01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:54.402
and we made a way to show
the world

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.937
that we actually existed.
