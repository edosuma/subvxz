00:04.138 --> 00:06.205
¶ ¶

00:10.711 --> 00:13.145
You totally committed.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.080
That barrel was sick!

00:15.082 --> 00:16.181
Yeah, too bad I didn't see

00:16.183 --> 00:18.117
That closeout section
in front of me.

00:18.119 --> 00:21.320
El niño giveth,
and el niño taketh.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.855
(laughs)

00:22.856 --> 00:24.389
Hey, do you want to go grab
a pressed juice or something?

00:29.296 --> 00:32.197
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you have plans.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.334
What's wrong?!

00:35.336 --> 00:36.368
(grunts)

00:42.076 --> 00:42.808
Whoa!

00:50.618 --> 00:52.084
Whoa! Hey!

00:52.086 --> 00:54.053
Watch it! Hey!

01:00.561 --> 01:02.694
(tires screech)

01:02.696 --> 01:03.529
(grunts)

01:05.833 --> 01:07.733
Please, you got to help me.

01:09.236 --> 01:11.203
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.337
Wait! Please...
(gunshot)

01:12.339 --> 01:14.273
(crowd screaming)

01:17.278 --> 01:19.344
(tires screeching)

01:22.783 --> 01:24.583
¶ ¶

01:43.270 --> 01:44.470
(excited chatter)
man: Give me that shot!

01:44.472 --> 01:46.105
J.J. Reddick!

01:46.107 --> 01:47.206
(cheering)

01:47.208 --> 01:49.241
Just a girl making it rain.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.877
Treys all day!
Threes from overseas!

01:51.879 --> 01:53.846
You know you're
down ten, right?

01:53.848 --> 01:55.297
Next time we
score, we win.

01:55.298 --> 01:56.747
Yeah, but we play better
under pressure, right, baby?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.750
Yeah, right.
Come on, baby.
Ball in.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.385
Callen: Is this
your first time playing?

02:00.387 --> 02:01.854
Is it your first time?
Kensi: I don't know.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.489
Come on, baby.
Considering my shots!

02:05.359 --> 02:07.259
Oh!

02:07.261 --> 02:09.261
Two in the paint!

02:09.263 --> 02:10.429
We rollin' now.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.864
That's what we do.
We shoot,

02:11.866 --> 02:14.333
We score, we win,
and we take home the trophy.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.400
Sam:
No, no. You lose,

02:15.402 --> 02:17.503
You sulk, carry our trophy home,

02:17.505 --> 02:19.171
And you buy us lunch.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.372
Ball in.

02:20.374 --> 02:21.673
You know you're supposed
to say "ball in,"

02:21.675 --> 02:23.142
And then you
throw the ball.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.310
My bad. My bad.
You gonna give-and-go on me?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.812
Oh!

02:26.814 --> 02:28.847
Hoist it up, my man!
No, no!

02:28.849 --> 02:30.482
(grunts)

02:30.484 --> 02:31.650
Oh! That's the game!
Oh!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.852
Oh! Nice assist, partner.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.387
Guys, best two games
out of three.

02:35.389 --> 02:36.872
Sam:
It's your self-esteem.

02:36.873 --> 02:38.356
No, because we have
exposed your weaknesses.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.491
We're ready.
We'll make this quick.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Two-on-two?

02:41.729 --> 02:44.930
No one, uh, thought about asking
me and the nellster to play?

02:44.932 --> 02:46.632
Oh, you and the nellster,
you guys been practicing?

02:46.634 --> 02:49.701
No. Not-not really,
but I did want to say

02:49.703 --> 02:51.336
That last time
we all played together,

02:51.338 --> 02:54.206
I-I don't think I ever mentioned
to you, but I was...

02:54.208 --> 02:55.440
Eric, focus.

02:55.442 --> 02:57.176
Spit it out.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.510
You're needed up in ops.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.845
Okay.
Fair enough.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.480
We should've had that game.
I know.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.514
We're staying home
this weekend and practicing.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.249
No, we're not.
We have kat's wedding.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.818
Ugh, it's gonna
be 250 guests.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.386
It's gonna be terrible.
It's gonna be great.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.766
Three years on varsity, bitches.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.769
What do you got, nell?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.571
Venice beach,
this morning.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.439
Surveillance video.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.541
Some nice sleds.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.778
Nell: Aaron kim spots these
two guys, and rabbits.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.784
Boy's got skills
on that board.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.620
Kensi: Oh, did not see
that coming.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.388
Neither did he.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.423
Nell:
Or this.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.860
Callen:
Look at those moves.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.295
Professional.

03:50.297 --> 03:51.797
Did they go after the girl?
Nell: Nope.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.349
Lapd interviewed her.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.900
She had just met aaron
this morning out in the water,

03:54.902 --> 03:56.268
So she can't help us.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.436
So who is aaron kim?

03:57.438 --> 03:58.503
Why were we sent this?

03:58.505 --> 04:00.372
Remember the
counterfeit handbag king

04:00.374 --> 04:01.907
From christmas?

04:02.977 --> 04:05.010
Mike hobbs.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.380
Dude also falsified documents
to help north korean spies

04:08.382 --> 04:09.615
Sneak into the u.S.

04:09.617 --> 04:12.417
And made a list
of those spies' names.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.919
And a joint fbi/ncis task force

04:13.921 --> 04:17.456
Has been running down all
the names on... The hobbs list.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.757
Appropriate title.
Hmm.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.425
Nell: But because
this murder was so public,

04:20.427 --> 04:22.294
And in our own backyard,

04:22.296 --> 04:23.996
Secnav wants us
running point now.

04:23.998 --> 04:26.365
Everyone is accounted for
on the hobbs list,

04:26.367 --> 04:27.833
Except for two names.
Nell: By accounted for,

04:27.835 --> 04:30.435
He means either dead
or in custody.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.372
Aaron kim was on that list,
so now there's only one.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.373
Eric:
Exactly.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.041
And this is the last name.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.710
Hobbs created
the identity of han choi

04:38.712 --> 04:39.945
And brought him into the u.S.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.580
But then the trail
stopped cold on that name

04:41.582 --> 04:43.582
Once he cleared customs.

04:43.584 --> 04:46.752
We know he's using an alias;
we just don't know what it is.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.487
The joint task force
can't locate him either.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.921
Sam: If we're
pulling this case,

04:49.923 --> 04:51.523
They believe choi's in l.A.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.691
Nell:
Which leads to

04:52.693 --> 04:54.693
Surveillance video
of han choi

04:54.695 --> 04:55.994
In this venice
hardware store.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.462
Deeks:
What do you mean? That's it?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.463
That's all we got?

04:58.465 --> 04:59.498
No footage of him
coming or going.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.565
But we did get

05:00.567 --> 05:01.767
A clean image on the two men

05:01.769 --> 05:03.435
Who attacked aaron kim
this morning.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.471
Facial rec matched them to
these fake passports they used

05:06.473 --> 05:08.573
At a boarder checkpoint
in tijuana three days ago.

05:08.575 --> 05:10.309
All right.
Sam and I will go after them.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.511
Kensi, deeks, see if
you can find han choi.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.779
On it.
Done.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.350
Where's granger?

05:18.352 --> 05:20.752
The assistant director is
en route to jennifer kim.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.354
You remember her,
right, g?

05:22.356 --> 05:25.724
North korean assassin that
laid the smack-down on you.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.326
Eric:
They sent her here

05:27.328 --> 05:28.994
To kill the agents
on the hobbs list.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.330
So now they're sending someone
to pick up where she left off.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.634
Think she'll have any
information that could help us?

05:35.636 --> 05:37.569
Even is she does,
would she help us?

05:37.571 --> 05:38.937
Hetty: That's what
the assistant director

05:38.939 --> 05:40.772
Is going to find out.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.341
Good luck, gentleman,

05:42.343 --> 05:43.809
On locating the shooters.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.359
Come on, let's go.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.098
Guys, this has been
a whirlwind courtship,

06:06.100 --> 06:07.566
And really, I'm just thrilled

06:07.568 --> 06:09.134
That the mighty fbi
is taking the time

06:09.136 --> 06:11.570
To show a humble private
fitness trainer the world.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.438
Do you ever
stop talking?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.840
It's called flirting.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.708
There's just something about
cheap nylon windbreakers

06:16.710 --> 06:18.377
That really do it for me.

06:18.379 --> 06:21.713
Ugh, you start screen-printing
big yellow letters on them,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.415
It's like catnip.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.750
Meow.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.818
We aren't getting rid of
this one fast enough.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.820
Getting rid of me? Oh.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.690
Who am I gonna get
to play with now?

06:31.692 --> 06:33.658
(chuckles):
Oh, joy.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.861
Fbi agent:
Assistant director.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.929
Authorization release.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.000
(tablet beeps)

06:42.002 --> 06:44.069
She's all yours.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.706
This thing with you
always showing up,

06:47.708 --> 06:49.775
It's bordering on an obsession.

06:49.777 --> 06:52.677
I hope you didn't come here
thinking you could break me,

06:52.679 --> 06:54.446
Get me to start singing
a different tune

06:54.448 --> 06:57.082
Than what I've been
telling the fbi for weeks.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.483
Give me your hands.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.858
I'm not helping you.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.927
I didn't expect
that you would.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.864
Let's go.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.169
What makes you think
I'm not gonna make a run for it?

07:19.139 --> 07:22.107
You don't strike me as
somebody who wants to get shot

07:22.109 --> 07:23.642
In the back of the head.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.487
Eric:<i> We're scanning</i>
<i> for additional camera feeds,</i>

07:35.489 --> 07:37.489
<i>But the street up on your right</i>

07:37.491 --> 07:39.991
<i> Is the last one that the</i>
<i>shooter's sedan was spotted on.</i>

07:39.993 --> 07:41.493
Callen:
<i> Got it, eric. Thanks.</i>

07:41.495 --> 07:43.862
Where'd you go
last night?

07:43.864 --> 07:46.131
What makes you think
I went anywhere?

07:46.133 --> 07:47.933
Your right inner wrist.

07:47.935 --> 07:51.470
Ah. Very good.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.772
Think about becoming a detective
or something.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.207
(laughs)

07:55.209 --> 07:57.209
I'm a natural.
Mm-hmm.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.677
The whiskey.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.580
The whiskey on sunset?
Mm-hmm.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.648
Rock club?
The one and only.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.084
All right, so you're sitting
there on a random weeknight

08:06.086 --> 08:07.219
In your furniture-less house...

08:07.221 --> 08:08.820
I got furniture.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.857
When something comes in
a tiny box with a million screws

08:11.859 --> 08:13.525
And becomes
a complete bedroom set,

08:13.527 --> 08:14.860
That's not furniture.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.962
The swedes do know
how to pack a box.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.698
Although, writing directions,
not so much.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.566
Okay, so you're sitting there
on your disposable couch,

08:21.568 --> 08:23.201
And you're thinking,
"I'm a little out of touch

08:23.203 --> 08:25.003
With the current state
of rock and roll."

08:25.005 --> 08:27.072
Anna wanted to go.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.509
(chuckles):
What?

08:30.511 --> 08:32.244
She doesn't know anyone in l.A.,

08:32.246 --> 08:36.248
And there's some thrash
metal band she wanted to see.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.282
Okay.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.683
Couple things.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.952
First of all,
she knows people in l.A.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.821
She knows kensi.
She knows deeks.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.222
She knows me.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.157
She knows you.
But only one of us

08:46.159 --> 08:47.292
Got the call.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.027
That's right.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.530
And second?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.032
Secondly, what classifies
a band as thrash metal?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.567
(laughs)

08:55.569 --> 08:57.269
Sounds like farm
equipment or something.

08:57.271 --> 08:58.770
I don't know.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.839
What I could gather,
it's the perfect blending

09:00.841 --> 09:02.774
Of volume and growling.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.543
Volume and growling.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.078
You'd have loved it.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.614
G. There's the car.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.295
(engine running)

09:30.637 --> 09:32.304
(engine stops)

09:35.976 --> 09:38.977
Ditch the car at an empty house,
hope someone steals it.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.012
Would have sent us
on a wild goose chase.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.281
That's a pretty nice move.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.849
The trunk.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.065
(sighs)

10:10.277 --> 10:11.343
(camera clicking)

10:21.221 --> 10:24.155
So this guy's known to lapd.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.291
His name is hunter henderson.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.094
He got popped for selling
automatic weapons.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.762
Well, that makes sense.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.397
Nell said that two of
the north korean shooters

10:32.399 --> 10:33.865
Came across at a
border crossing.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.333
Which means when
they got to l.A.,

10:35.335 --> 10:36.801
They wouldn't have
had any weapons.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.204
They call a guy
like hunter.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.256
Set up a meet.

10:41.257 --> 10:43.307
Instead of paying him,
they kill him and take his ride.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.877
That's just rude.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.680
Ops have any luck locating them
after they ditched the car?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.181
Not yet. Still searching.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.883
I got something.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.752
(grunts)

10:53.754 --> 10:55.053
Got a phone.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.188
And it's still on.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.791
Well, see if eric can
pull anything off this.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.426
All right.
Thank you so much.
Mm-hmm.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.827
What do you got?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.062
No one's seen han choi.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.296
You find out anything?

11:05.298 --> 11:07.799
Not about choi,
but I did learn that hipsters

11:07.801 --> 11:10.335
Don't actually like
being called hipsters.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.170
Okay. What do they like
being called?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.372
"bearded men,
very tight pants,

11:14.374 --> 11:15.740
Dirty chuck taylors."

11:15.742 --> 11:17.242
I don't think
that flows as well.

11:17.244 --> 11:18.243
Yeah.

11:18.245 --> 11:19.778
Okay, so eric and nell

11:19.780 --> 11:21.680
Say they have
footage of han choi

11:21.682 --> 11:24.282
In the hardware store,
but not coming or going.

11:24.284 --> 11:27.385
There's no other footage from
any other camera on this street.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.688
Uh...

11:29.690 --> 11:32.323
What if he didn't enter
the store from the street?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.025
Oh, a teleporting
north korean spy?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.610
I'm with you.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.194
What if he came down
from one of these apartments?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.064
A flying teleporting spy.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.299
Pretty sure there's
a movie pitch in here.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.804
Fire escape.
Back door.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.840
Or choi's private staircase
and entrance

11:48.842 --> 11:51.276
To overpriced,
handcrafted hipster tools.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.343
Sure.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.845
I got this.
Um, I don't think

11:53.847 --> 11:55.346
You have to,
'cause we can just go around...

11:55.348 --> 11:56.698
Baby, I got this all day.

11:56.699 --> 11:58.049
That's why they call me
white chocolate.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.951
What you got girl?
Okay. You're gonna
hurt yourself.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.470
(grunting)

12:02.471 --> 12:04.988
I'm gonna go around the front
and see if I can find the owner.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.324
Oh, that's a good idea.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.892
And by the way,
jumping like that

12:07.894 --> 12:10.061
Is exactly why we lost
the game this morning!

12:12.999 --> 12:14.466
You want some tea?

12:14.468 --> 12:15.467
Mm.

12:15.469 --> 12:16.501
How about some bubbly?

12:16.503 --> 12:18.169
They got any veuve back there?

12:20.140 --> 12:22.140
Just take the tea.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.376
Maybe you should see someone
about that temper.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.249
So, let me guess.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.985
You had so much fun with me
on the flight to d.C.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.420
That you volunteered
to fly me to cabo

12:35.422 --> 12:37.222
For a little fun in the sun.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.993
Where's that agent these days?

12:41.995 --> 12:44.496
The cute one that I beat up
in a furniture store.

12:44.498 --> 12:47.499
You didn't beat up agent callen.

12:47.501 --> 12:49.968
You wouldn't be in
custody if you had.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.003
He doesn't fight fair.
Do you?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.538
Not if I can help it.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.509
Have you ever heard
the name aaron kim?

12:57.511 --> 13:00.779
Yeah.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.515
He's one of the people hobbs
helped smuggle into the u.S.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.817
Okay, he was killed
this morning.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.520
Did you know him?

13:08.522 --> 13:09.821
I'd met him.

13:12.893 --> 13:16.427
They sent a version of me to
kill everyone on the hobbs list,

13:16.429 --> 13:18.396
And now you want my help.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.900
Jennifer, it has nothing...

13:21.902 --> 13:22.934
Jennifer?

13:24.538 --> 13:25.537
(chuckles softly)

13:25.539 --> 13:26.938
She never told you

13:26.940 --> 13:28.840
My name.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.575
No, she didn't.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.045
Will you?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.351
Where is your mother?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.287
(sighs)

13:42.289 --> 13:44.222
I don't know.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.458
Did she tell you about me?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.527
Yeah.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.366
Because I always figured
your mother would never...

13:55.368 --> 13:56.334
I knew.

13:56.336 --> 13:59.571
The whole time.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.540
I knew a man named owen granger
was my father.

14:07.581 --> 14:10.014
Tea's cold.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.150
I'm gonna get a fresh cup.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.492
Hey, boys.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.162
So, the victim, hunter
henderson, may have been dead,

14:24.164 --> 14:25.530
But his phone was
very much alive,

14:25.532 --> 14:27.866
And with that,
I was able to

14:27.868 --> 14:29.100
Track the movements
of the shooters.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.969
Where was
henderson killed?

14:30.971 --> 14:32.937
Well, looks like
right here,

14:32.939 --> 14:34.606
In, uh, culver city.

14:34.608 --> 14:37.041
'cause right after that,
the phone went to venice beach,

14:37.043 --> 14:39.377
Where aaron kim was murdered,
and there's no sign of hunter

14:39.379 --> 14:41.479
In the sedan,
so he was probably in the trunk

14:41.481 --> 14:43.114
By that point.
After venice,

14:43.116 --> 14:45.884
Any stops before the house
where we found the car?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.436
Just one.

14:47.437 --> 14:48.987
Here. Parking lot near
whole foods on lincoln.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.188
I know that place.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.657
Really?

14:52.658 --> 14:55.125
You know a place where they
sell organic, natural food?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.327
I'm evolving.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.629
Ah.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.163
They've got a wine bar
at that whole foods

14:59.165 --> 15:00.365
And extensive
beer collection.

15:00.366 --> 15:01.566
And the burger joint
in the parking lot

15:01.568 --> 15:03.501
Has a very good chili dog,
thank you.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.403
What did the shooters
do when they got there?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.222
Looks like

15:07.223 --> 15:09.040
They picked up
some reinforcements.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.175
There's two guys
inside the suv,

15:11.177 --> 15:13.544
But with the tint,
can't make out their faces.

15:13.546 --> 15:14.946
Sam: Parking lot's
less than a mile

15:14.948 --> 15:17.015
From where we found
henderson's body.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.618
They must have ditched the
car and jumped in the suv.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.655
I have the suv headed west
on pico 20 minutes ago.

15:23.657 --> 15:25.290
Looking for
a current location.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.491
We're headed that way.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.693
I will let you know
when I get a hit.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.029
So you've seen this man
entering the apartment?

15:31.031 --> 15:32.530
Uh, yeah, once or twice.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.065
With this hippie chick.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.266
Hippie, huh?

15:35.268 --> 15:36.567
Well, uh,
you know, the clothes.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.969
Not the ideas.
Ah.

15:37.971 --> 15:39.470
Kensi: I'm sorry, what
was your name again?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.939
Just call me the captain.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.441
Okay.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.942
Uh, captain, uh,
this man is the tenant?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.677
I don't know.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.111
Well...

15:47.113 --> 15:48.513
Yeah, I mean, maybe.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.281
Uh, a corporation rented it.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.317
You know,
they sent me a cashier's check

15:52.319 --> 15:53.651
For two year's rent in advance.

15:53.653 --> 15:54.585
(chuckles)

15:54.587 --> 15:56.154
So this guy,

15:56.156 --> 15:57.422
He-he do something?

15:57.424 --> 15:58.990
I mean, he in trouble?

15:58.992 --> 16:01.292
When was the last time
you saw him come here?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.727
Don't know.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.362
It's been a while, actually.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.331
Do you mind if
we take a look

16:06.333 --> 16:07.498
Around the apartment?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.466
Sure thing, toots.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.702
Just follow the captain.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.170
She called me "toots."

16:12.172 --> 16:14.305
She just called herself
"the captain."

16:14.307 --> 16:16.040
Nice beard.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.411
¶ ¶

16:42.635 --> 16:44.702
¶ ¶

16:57.283 --> 16:58.282
(knocking)

16:58.284 --> 17:00.018
Hello?

17:00.020 --> 17:02.687
(rap music playing faintly)

17:02.689 --> 17:04.322
Hello?

17:04.324 --> 17:05.523
I-I got the, um...

17:05.525 --> 17:08.026
Oh, what do you guys
call yourselves?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.227
Federal agents.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.762
We just have
a few questions for you.

17:10.764 --> 17:12.964
Hello?

17:12.965 --> 17:15.165
Kensi: Do you mind if
we just take a look around?

17:15.168 --> 17:17.268
Captain's got to keep
a schedule. Have at it.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.805
Just take a second,
so if we, uh, could just...

17:20.807 --> 17:22.640
Oh, wow.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.275
She just...
(whistles)

17:24.277 --> 17:26.044
Got a punching bag
in the living room.

17:26.046 --> 17:26.778
I can do this.

17:26.780 --> 17:28.146
You know, a little workout,

17:28.148 --> 17:29.247
Watch a movie.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.532
(hisses sharply)
yeah.

17:30.533 --> 17:31.816
We could have a punching bag
in the living room.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.818
I just won't be
living there.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.286
Oh, wow. Okay.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.755
So no boxing paraphernalia
in the living room.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.290
Noted.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.328
I'm not really finding
any personal items in here.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.830
No mail, no
notes, nothing.

17:45.832 --> 17:49.300
Well, he is a spy, so leaving
about a bunch of junk mail

17:49.302 --> 17:51.769
With your alias on it
may not be the best of...

17:51.771 --> 17:54.739
I get it. Yeah.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.641
Wow.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.546
Huh. Yeah.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.215
If he is living here, he
hasn't been here for a while.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.349
Or he doesn't dust.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.618
Turns out, some people
just don't dust.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.256
Or maybe we spooked him when we
arrested hobbs and jennifer kim.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.724
Well, if that's the case...
(door opens)

18:13.726 --> 18:14.859
Federal agents!

18:14.861 --> 18:16.260
Are you her?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.562
Oh, now cory's
bringing his slutty

18:17.564 --> 18:19.497
Side-pieces here?
The place I stay at?

18:19.499 --> 18:20.398
Oh, oh, okay. All right.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.632
Slutty side-pieces?
Yeah.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.600
Get off of me.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.801
Back away.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.103
Back it up.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.404
Either I hold onto you,
or she shoots you.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.405
Totally your call.

18:27.407 --> 18:28.606
You ain't his
type, anyway.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.141
You need a ass implant.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.476
Mm-hmm.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.372
<i> (rap music playing)</i>

18:44.373 --> 18:46.623
Turn that damn music down!
(music quiets)

18:46.626 --> 18:48.793
So you're saying you've never
hooked up with cory.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.195
We're federal agents.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.397
I've never even met cory.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.665
And I'm supposed to take you
at your word?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.368
Well, now that trust
has been established.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.337
This is cory, right?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.172
Yeah.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.874
Wait, if you two are
really federal agents...

19:02.876 --> 19:04.225
We are.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.575
...Then why are you
interested in cory?

19:05.578 --> 19:08.346
He's a lying cheat,
but he's not a crook.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.614
Okay.

19:09.616 --> 19:11.482
Cory's real name

19:11.484 --> 19:13.351
Is han choi.

19:13.352 --> 19:15.219
Or we don't know what his actual
given name in korea is,

19:15.221 --> 19:16.621
But han choi
is the name under which

19:16.623 --> 19:18.222
He entered the u.S.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.391
Korea? Entered the u.S.?

19:20.393 --> 19:22.360
Cory grew up in thousand oaks.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.163
He thinks culture is
eating kalbi down on western.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.266
I think you have the wrong guy.

19:28.268 --> 19:30.434
What's cory's last name, and
what does he do for a living?

19:30.436 --> 19:31.536
Sung. And he's an artist.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.237
What kind of artist?
Like, a painter

19:33.239 --> 19:34.772
Or a sculptor?
Like denim.

19:34.774 --> 19:38.309
Cory crafts these
one-of-a-kind custom jeans.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.877
Japanese selvedge
but with a little stretch.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.946
Well, you can't
forget the stretch.
No.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.514
Just a little.
Like, two percent.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.517
So where exactly does
he make these jeans?

19:46.519 --> 19:48.252
His workshop.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.654
And where is
his workshop located?

19:51.558 --> 19:52.623
And the workshop is located...?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.525
I don't know.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.328
Cory always talked about it,
but he never took me.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.081
Wait.

20:00.082 --> 20:01.965
Are you guys thinking that cory
was copying his designs?

20:01.968 --> 20:04.769
Like, like they weren't
his own custom creations?

20:16.449 --> 20:17.748
Shooters pulled down
this street.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.318
Ops hasn't seen them since.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.386
Must be holed up
in one of these buildings.

20:22.388 --> 20:26.224
Garages, warehouses--
he could be anywhere.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.692
You having
a seizure there?

20:27.694 --> 20:29.227
(laughs)

20:29.229 --> 20:30.661
Nah, endorphins.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.763
While you and anna were
getting your thrash metal on

20:32.765 --> 20:34.966
Last night,
I went to the boxing gym.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.601
Six rounds.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.970
Fresh guy each round.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.405
Come on. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.975
What, was the ring set up
in an old folks' home?

20:43.977 --> 20:45.676
Was it ten-second rounds?

20:45.678 --> 20:47.378
Give it to me. Come on.
I-I got nothing.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.379
Six rounds is impressive.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.897
I just thought
you had a bad knee,

20:49.898 --> 20:51.414
And you were pulling back
on the sparring, that's all.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.517
I was, but that was before cryo.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.419
Cryo?

20:55.421 --> 20:56.854
Cryotherapy.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.489
Fountain of youth, baby.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.758
Feel like I could
jump over a bus when I'm done.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.760
Okay, so is that like
a fancy way of saying

21:02.762 --> 21:04.528
That you took
an ice bath last night?

21:04.530 --> 21:05.529
No, no, no.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.897
Negative 200
degrees fahrenheit.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.466
Three minutes,
done and done.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.034
I got it. Okay.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.601
So it's more like a, uh,
a carbonite experience.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.937
You're kind of
like han solo.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.472
We'll hit it up
this week.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.706
I'm telling you, g,
it'll change your life.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.907
Frostbite usually does.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.476
L.A. Has clearly gotten to you.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.811
I mean, can you imagine
what a midwest farmer would say

21:20.813 --> 21:23.681
When he found out that you
paid someone to freeze you?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.684
"that sam hanna's one cool guy."

21:26.686 --> 21:29.587
You've lost your mind.

21:29.589 --> 21:33.557
So granger's escorting
jennifer kim back to l.A.,

21:33.559 --> 21:37.895
'cause there's a pack of north
korean shooters operating here.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.530
Want to hear my theory?

21:39.532 --> 21:40.531
First of all,

21:40.533 --> 21:42.566
"a pack" of shooters?

21:42.568 --> 21:44.085
Well, yeah.

21:44.086 --> 21:45.603
Sounds better than
"gaggle," right?

21:45.605 --> 21:46.570
I guess.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.973
Anyway, my theory.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.541
Do you want to hear it?

21:50.543 --> 21:53.411
That's not really
a question, is it?

21:53.413 --> 21:56.681
I think granger
and jennifer kim

21:56.683 --> 21:58.482
Are having a thing.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.483
What?

21:59.485 --> 22:01.385
No.

22:01.387 --> 22:02.887
No, eric.

22:02.889 --> 22:03.888
(scoffs)

22:03.890 --> 22:05.623
Think about it, nell.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.825
He escorted her to d.C.
Three weeks ago,

22:07.827 --> 22:10.661
And now he's there again.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.864
Are you asking
me if I think

22:13.866 --> 22:16.367
Owen granger is having
romantic relations

22:16.369 --> 22:18.569
With a verified
north korean spy

22:18.571 --> 22:21.672
And having trysts,

22:21.674 --> 22:25.609
While en route to various
interrogation locations?

22:25.611 --> 22:27.745
Is that what
you're asking me?

22:29.716 --> 22:32.116
Well, you don't have
to be so mean about it.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.051
Oh, come on.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.052
(computer beeps)

22:35.054 --> 22:36.053
Whoa.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.788
Check this out.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.557
Cory sung--
han's alias.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.626
He's listed as a subleaser
on a commercial space downtown.

22:42.628 --> 22:45.096
That's less than a half a block
away from callen and sam.

22:45.098 --> 22:46.697
Yep.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.434
(sighs)

22:50.436 --> 22:52.803
All they've got to eat
are these protein bars.

22:54.741 --> 22:55.673
Want one?

22:55.675 --> 22:57.408
I'm gonna take a pass.

22:59.445 --> 23:00.878
Probably just as well.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.447
They taste like chalk.

23:03.449 --> 23:07.118
So when we had our talk
before down by the beach...

23:07.120 --> 23:09.120
That's a beautiful
way of saying

23:09.122 --> 23:11.489
"when you were interrogating
me in that shack."

23:11.491 --> 23:13.124
You were right.

23:13.126 --> 23:16.994
Well, kind of.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.630
My mom taught me english
when I was a child.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.732
But we moved around a lot.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.033
She always had jobs.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.835
Yeah, government jobs.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.670
Like mother, like daughter.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.539
I lived with her

23:28.541 --> 23:29.740
Until I was 12,

23:29.742 --> 23:31.642
And then I went to...

23:31.644 --> 23:33.778
What did you call it?

23:33.780 --> 23:35.746
Spy school in the mountains.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.881
But no one took me.

23:36.883 --> 23:38.716
I wanted to go.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.651
And she just signed off on it?

23:40.653 --> 23:42.586
She just let you go?

23:42.588 --> 23:45.022
No.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.824
I ran away.

23:48.995 --> 23:52.062
Well, I flew into town
for your tenth birthday.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.633
I'm sure you never
heard about it.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.735
Your mother didn't think
it was a good idea for me to...

23:57.737 --> 23:59.770
It didn't come from her.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.773
She told me you were in town.
I didn't want to see you.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.646
Well, I can understand that.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.648
Good.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.684
In your eyes, I abandoned you,
so why would you want to see me?

24:13.686 --> 24:15.486
No.

24:15.488 --> 24:17.455
It wasn't about
you abandoning me.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.956
It wasn't about

24:18.958 --> 24:20.791
You, really, at all.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.628
I had everything
I needed.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.630
All the love.

24:26.632 --> 24:30.968
Everything I could ever want,
I got from her.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.103
She was my mother

24:33.105 --> 24:35.606
And my father.

24:35.608 --> 24:37.641
You... You were just
an american,

24:37.643 --> 24:40.711
Sitting in a hotel room,
calling us on the phone.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.081
Sorry.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.151
That was a little harsh.

24:49.755 --> 24:53.491
See, I told myself
that your, uh, mother

24:53.493 --> 24:56.193
Was the one keeping me from you,
keeping us apart.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.732
And, you know,
it was a good thing.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.133
It was, it was easier.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.936
It helped me reconcile
not being a part of your life.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.875
I'm...

25:12.578 --> 25:15.846
...So sorry...

25:15.848 --> 25:17.915
About everything.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.554
It's not a sad story.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.158
I mean, some kids never know the
love that I had with my mother.

25:33.799 --> 25:38.269
Well, I missed the opportunity
to be your father.

25:38.271 --> 25:41.605
So maybe someday...

25:41.607 --> 25:43.941
I can be your friend.

25:46.612 --> 25:49.947
I'm suspected of being
a north korean spy.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.016
Are those the friends
you tend to keep?

25:56.822 --> 25:59.990
I don't...

25:59.992 --> 26:02.893
Tend to make friends.

26:05.565 --> 26:07.665
Well...

26:07.667 --> 26:09.867
That's something
we have in common.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.077
Maybe with a little cryo
you'd be able to keep up.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.346
Just open the door, iceman.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.338
Federal agent!

26:47.340 --> 26:49.173
Hands over your head!

26:49.175 --> 26:50.674
Oh, thank god you're here.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.209
Cory sung?
Yeah.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.377
Don't move.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.912
Keep your hands
right there.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.914
These guys, they
they came here.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.182
They tried to hurt me,

26:58.184 --> 26:59.783
But they took off
when they heard you guys.

26:59.785 --> 27:00.784
You're here alone right now?

27:00.786 --> 27:01.969
Yeah.

27:01.970 --> 27:03.153
Sam: We're gonna
take you into custody.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.089
We're gonna protect you
from them.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.357
Okay.

27:24.777 --> 27:25.943
(grunts)

27:34.020 --> 27:35.853
(car engine starts)

27:54.974 --> 27:57.408
Eric, you got eyes
on that suv yet?

27:57.410 --> 27:59.276
We're running
all the cameras in the area,

27:59.278 --> 28:01.145
But as of now, we lost them.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.212
All right, stay on it.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.213
Copy that, sam.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.948
(whistles)
you guys good?

28:04.950 --> 28:07.718
Yeah, we're good.

28:07.720 --> 28:08.919
So, han choi was
the poison pill, huh?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.387
Yeah.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.647
That's a nice
little plan.

28:11.648 --> 28:12.906
Send him in with the
original group of spies.

28:12.907 --> 28:14.165
Anything goes wrong,
he's here to clean up.

28:14.166 --> 28:15.424
Callen: Get anything more
out of his girlfriend?

28:15.428 --> 28:16.760
Deeks:
No, no.

28:16.762 --> 28:17.995
Clementine isn't exactly
the most helpful,

28:17.997 --> 28:19.697
Or useful, witness.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.165
(clears throat)
or perhaps the brightest.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.766
Although,
she is pretty convinced

28:22.768 --> 28:24.935
That choi and kensi over here
are having an affair.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.170
Even I'm getting

28:26.172 --> 28:28.823
A little suspicious.

28:28.824 --> 28:31.475
So, uh, you guys get anything
from the shooters you took out?

28:31.477 --> 28:33.477
No. They were clean.

28:33.479 --> 28:34.845
Hold on a second.

28:34.847 --> 28:36.747
Aaron kim was
the last name on that list,

28:36.749 --> 28:38.449
And they took care
of him this morning.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.384
But choi and his men
are still in town.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.920
They have a new mark.

28:42.922 --> 28:43.921
Jennifer kim.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.055
Choi must know

28:45.057 --> 28:46.790
That she's coming back to l.A.

28:46.792 --> 28:49.426
But granger's only in the air
with her for another hour.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.730
We have to find those shooters
before that plane lands.

28:52.732 --> 28:53.997
Yep.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.768
Okay.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.737
Thanks, henrietta.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.207
Up until this moment,

29:03.209 --> 29:05.809
We thought han choi
was the next target.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.344
Two agents have just gone
to apprehend him.

29:07.346 --> 29:08.879
But choi's not a target.

29:08.881 --> 29:10.114
He's running the operation

29:10.116 --> 29:12.182
To take out everyone
on the hobbs list.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.953
And where does he stand
with that?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.955
Everyone on the list
is either dead or in custody.

29:17.957 --> 29:21.358
Well, if he goes under,
you'll never catch him.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.360
But you have one thing
working in your favor.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.862
What's that?

29:24.864 --> 29:27.931
He won't go under
until he's killed me.

29:32.304 --> 29:35.205
All right, so I've got
footage of the suv

29:35.207 --> 29:36.974
Entering this
mall parking structure,

29:36.976 --> 29:38.242
But it hasn't exited.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.877
They could be driving
anything by now.

29:39.879 --> 29:40.878
Ugh, all right.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.412
I'm gonna review footage

29:42.414 --> 29:44.548
Of drivers
exiting the structure.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.849
Sounds like a plan.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.217
Hey, nell.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.286
Yes?

29:49.288 --> 29:51.955
You know the whole, um,

29:51.957 --> 29:54.258
Owen granger
and jennifer kim

29:54.260 --> 29:57.161
Are-are... Lovers thing?

29:57.163 --> 29:58.162
Yeah?

29:58.164 --> 30:00.130
Yeah, can we keep that
between us?

30:00.132 --> 30:02.499
Oh. I already
forgot you said it.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.967
Thanks.

30:06.806 --> 30:07.938
I don't know
if they'll believe it.

30:07.940 --> 30:08.939
Well, that's the thing.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.307
North korea won't have time

30:10.309 --> 30:11.308
To vet the information.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.010
They'll just pass it on to choi.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.077
Sit down.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.082
Okay.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.851
What do you want me to say?

30:20.853 --> 30:24.822
Okay, tell them you've killed me
and taken control of the plane.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.557
Now, this plane is
supposed to land

30:26.559 --> 30:29.059
At santa monica airport,
but ncis will be there,

30:29.061 --> 30:33.530
Which is why you're
rerouting it to... Burbank.

30:33.532 --> 30:36.466
You need immediate
assistance.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.402
Okay.

30:38.404 --> 30:40.404
Done.

30:40.406 --> 30:42.339
So if we're straight
in our thinking,

30:42.341 --> 30:45.242
Choi will know exactly where
his next target is gonna be.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.577
Okay.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.579
Are you gonna
loop in your team?

30:48.581 --> 30:50.948
Send them to burbank
to intercept him?

30:52.351 --> 30:53.550
No.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.919
We're going
radio silent.

30:55.921 --> 30:57.454
We're gonna do
our own thing on this one.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.156
Why is that?

30:59.158 --> 31:02.593
If choi finds out
we're baiting him to burbank,

31:02.595 --> 31:05.162
He's gonna go underground until
he figures out his next move.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.330
And like you said,

31:06.332 --> 31:08.465
He goes under,
he's a ghost.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.901
But how would choi get word
that it's a trap?

31:10.903 --> 31:13.270
I just don't want
to take the chance.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.406
Is there someone
in your organization

31:16.408 --> 31:18.075
That you don't trust?

31:21.547 --> 31:24.181
You have a mole.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.016
Priceless.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.987
You been able to
talk to granger?

31:29.989 --> 31:32.589
Earlier, but I can't
get through now.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.626
Nell's trying to contact him
through the pilot for me.

31:35.628 --> 31:36.560
Hetty,

31:36.562 --> 31:37.995
It's obvious

31:37.997 --> 31:39.496
Granger has some kind
of personal interest

31:39.498 --> 31:40.564
With jennifer kim.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.333
What is it?

31:43.335 --> 31:45.903
It's complicated.

31:45.905 --> 31:49.172
I've got the react tactical team

31:49.174 --> 31:51.508
At santa monica airport,

31:51.510 --> 31:54.111
Waiting to escort granger
and jennifer kim

31:54.113 --> 31:55.612
To a safe house.
Well, there's no telling

31:55.614 --> 31:57.648
How much information
that choi's gonna have

31:57.650 --> 31:59.483
On jennifer's whereabouts,
so we'll meet the react team,

31:59.485 --> 32:00.684
We'll be there
when granger lands.

32:00.686 --> 32:02.052
That's a good idea.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.321
Hetty.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.490
The assistant director's
plane just changed direction.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.458
It was making its approach
to santa monica airport,

32:08.460 --> 32:10.027
And then it diverted.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.628
And where's it heading?

32:11.630 --> 32:14.031
Burbank airport.
It's landing right now.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.933
All right,
we won't involve the local pd.

32:15.935 --> 32:17.668
I'll get
the react team moving,

32:17.670 --> 32:19.469
And you need to go.

32:21.006 --> 32:23.106
Nell, alert kensi and deeks.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.508
Copy that.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.055
You wait.

33:00.713 --> 33:02.713
Looks like we're still clear.

33:02.715 --> 33:05.048
They're not here yet.

33:11.724 --> 33:14.458
All right, go into
the main building,

33:14.460 --> 33:16.460
Tell them to lock the doors
and keep security and pd away.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.095
I'll handle this.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.163
Get going.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.700
(tires screeching)

33:23.702 --> 33:25.102
Run!

33:52.698 --> 33:54.297
Go.

33:57.770 --> 33:59.436
Give me your backup weapon.

33:59.437 --> 34:01.103
I can't be unarmed
if choi comes after me.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.511
Thanks.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.684
All right, I'll take the east
side, you run the west wall.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.536
We'll meet...

34:16.537 --> 34:18.387
We'll corral them
into the middle of the hangar.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.623
Yeah.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.751
Hey.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.847
(gun clicks, rapid gunfire)

35:30.395 --> 35:31.561
Don't.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.533
(panting)

35:38.504 --> 35:39.569
No closer.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.439
Let her go.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.541
There's no one around here.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.443
No one will see
if you just walk away.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.145
No one will ever know.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.881
Well, that's not gonna happen.

35:50.883 --> 35:52.349
She's an enemy
of your government,

35:52.351 --> 35:53.717
And she's going to die.

35:53.719 --> 35:56.486
You should be happy
with that outcome.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.754
You shouldn't die with her.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.934
Had a feeling you took a little
souvenir from the plane.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.505
It was a good fork.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.815
Callen: This could've
gone south fast.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.651
Granger:
Yeah, but it didn't.

36:27.653 --> 36:29.786
Kinda did.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.522
Deeks:
Granger danger for the win!

36:33.458 --> 36:34.658
Assistant director.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.193
Yeah, but
assistant director danger

36:36.194 --> 36:37.727
Doesn't really have the same
pop to it, now does it?

36:37.729 --> 36:40.630
Too risky to loop us in?

36:40.632 --> 36:42.299
Choi's surveillance
could've picked it up,

36:42.301 --> 36:43.967
Or he could've found out it was
a trap through other means.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.535
The mole.

36:46.471 --> 36:48.605
Look, this has gone on too long.

36:48.607 --> 36:51.775
We need to identify
and take out this mole.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.277
Hetty and I are doing that.

36:57.482 --> 36:59.783
All right, well,
let's get out of here.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.452
You need a ride?

37:02.454 --> 37:03.853
I'm gonna take her
to the safe house.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.335
(vehicle engines starting)

37:22.608 --> 37:24.307
Deeks: I'm not saying
that I don't want to go.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.309
Wait a minute. Did I say
that I don't want to go?

37:26.311 --> 37:28.745
No, but you were making fun
and you were laughing about it,

37:28.747 --> 37:30.380
So I just figured you
weren't interested.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.681
Baby, kat is one of
your closest friends.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.350
If she's getting married,

37:33.351 --> 37:35.018
Of course we're gonna
celebrate that together.

37:35.020 --> 37:36.586
Thank you.

37:36.588 --> 37:37.954
And by the way,
I completely acknowledge

37:37.956 --> 37:39.589
That this is not
your kind of wedding.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.591
Baby, this shouldn't be
anyone's kind of wedding.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.959
She's gonna have actual
show ponies there.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.428
(laughs)

37:45.430 --> 37:47.430
Kat does love her ponies.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.798
Everyone loves ponies,
but I'm just saying,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.900
Spending thousands of dollars
on hundreds of people

37:50.902 --> 37:52.702
That you barely know
just to show off...

37:52.704 --> 37:53.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.305
She's not showing off.

37:55.307 --> 37:56.539
She's genuinely happy.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.308
Okay.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.476
You're right.
You're right.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.011
I guess I'm just
saying that I'm more

38:01.013 --> 38:03.013
Of a wedding on the
beach kind of guy,

38:03.015 --> 38:05.649
With just a few people that
you love and that love you.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.684
I love you.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.486
I love you, too.

38:11.723 --> 38:16.626
And I know that
a small beach wedding

38:16.628 --> 38:18.795
Sounds absolutely incredible.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.597
It does, right?
Mm-hmm.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.599
Be just me and you
and the moms

38:22.601 --> 38:25.001
And monty digging
a hole in the sand.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.336
The surf is right there.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.937
It-it could be magical.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.073
Yeah, it could be.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.980
Now I think we should
get you some food,

38:36.982 --> 38:39.649
Because you're about
to get hangry.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.518
I need a chalupa.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.585
(both laugh)

38:44.790 --> 38:46.756
(sighs)

38:46.758 --> 38:49.526
Oh, but, um, the guys
from work have to be there.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.760
Obviously, the
guys from work.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.696
Yeah. And-and my girlfriends.
I mean...

38:52.698 --> 38:54.564
Mandy, mindy, tiffany
and tiffany.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.116
Wouldn't be a party
without them.

38:56.117 --> 38:57.667
Also, maybe the friends that
invited me to their weddings,

38:57.669 --> 38:58.735
'cause I don't want
to be rude.

38:58.737 --> 38:59.936
Yeah, that's,
like, ten people.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.888
Well, more like 15.

39:01.889 --> 39:03.839
Oh, god, I hate when people
don't invite with plus one.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.642
So dates. Everybody gets
to bring a date.

39:05.644 --> 39:06.710
Wait. Seriously?
Everyone gets a date?

39:06.712 --> 39:07.944
Ooh, my friends
from sniper school.

39:07.946 --> 39:09.446
We totally need
to invite them.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.047
Okay, we just crossed over
the hundred guest mark.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.750
Also, you want to combine mandy,
mindy, tiffany, tiffany,

39:13.752 --> 39:15.418
The sniper school guys
and alcohol?

39:15.420 --> 39:17.921
(laughs): Oh, what could
possibly go wrong?

39:24.629 --> 39:26.629
(sighs)

39:26.630 --> 39:28.630
So another big night out
on the sunset strip, huh?

39:28.633 --> 39:30.033
Nah.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.101
(chuckles)

39:31.103 --> 39:32.769
What exactly does

39:32.771 --> 39:35.071
Callen thrash metal
attire look like, anyway?

39:35.073 --> 39:37.807
Pretty much what callen
at work attire looks like.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.043
Good evening, gentlemen.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.044
Callen:
Hetty.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.612
How is, uh, granger doing?

39:42.614 --> 39:44.347
Well, I think

39:44.348 --> 39:46.081
That's probably a question
better suited to him.

39:46.084 --> 39:49.853
You said his interest
in jennifer kim was complicated.

39:49.855 --> 39:51.588
Mm.

39:51.590 --> 39:52.622
What does that mean?

39:52.624 --> 39:54.090
Well, again, that's a question

39:54.092 --> 39:56.793
Better suited to him.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.068
Clippers tickets.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.003
First row behind the bench?
Yeah.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.805
Where'd you get these?

40:08.807 --> 40:11.007
They arrived today,
courtesy of mr. Ballmer.

40:12.944 --> 40:16.946
To celebrate ncis's
50th anniversary.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.081
Why didn't you
take the tickets, hetty?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.583
Are you kidding?
I'm a lakers girl.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.786
Guys, you're gonna
miss tip-off.

40:22.788 --> 40:23.987
Get out of here.

40:23.989 --> 40:25.088
Thank you, hetty.

40:25.090 --> 40:26.623
Oh, yeah.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.058
Hold on a second.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.528
Did she say
she was a lakers girl

40:31.530 --> 40:34.164
Or<i> laker</i> girl?

40:35.901 --> 40:37.634
(both laugh)

40:39.971 --> 40:42.071
Jennifer:
The california dream.

40:42.073 --> 40:45.074
Never thought it was real.

40:45.076 --> 40:47.110
Look at them.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.545
Don't you ever feel like

40:48.547 --> 40:50.914
Everyone in the world
is happy, carefree,

40:50.916 --> 40:53.950
Everyone except us?

40:53.952 --> 40:56.553
Maybe they're looking at us
thinking the same thing.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.090
Yeah, probably not.

41:01.092 --> 41:05.528
Listen, everybody in the world's
dealing with something.

41:05.530 --> 41:08.865
Are you gonna get in trouble
for doing your own thing today?

41:08.867 --> 41:10.166
No.

41:10.168 --> 41:13.770
I'm the assistant director;
I get to do what I want.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.211
Granger.

41:26.084 --> 41:27.550
What's up?

41:27.552 --> 41:30.119
I want out.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.655
Okay.

41:32.657 --> 41:36.159
I'll tell you everything I know,
but I'll need...

41:36.161 --> 41:37.760
I'll protect you.

41:37.762 --> 41:40.630
I'll help you cut ties
with the north koreans,

41:40.632 --> 41:43.132
And we'll work with justice
on your incarceration.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.668
If you become an asset,

41:45.670 --> 41:47.537
There are things
that can be done.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.110
Do you know where my mother is?

41:54.112 --> 41:56.913
No.

41:56.915 --> 42:00.083
Will you help me find her?

42:00.085 --> 42:01.784
Yes.

42:01.786 --> 42:04.921
She's not gonna be easy to find.

42:04.923 --> 42:07.991
We'll find her together.

42:12.998 --> 42:14.163
Yujin.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.167
Yujin.

42:18.169 --> 42:21.137
You should know my name.

42:22.307 --> 42:24.641
If you still want to be friends.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.716
Granger:
<i> I'd like that.</i>
