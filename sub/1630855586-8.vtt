00:06.006 --> 00:07.758
<i>From the moment beings emerge,</i>

00:07.758 --> 00:09.343
<i>they begin to celebrate their emergence.</i>

00:09.885 --> 00:11.553
<i>First, every week for four weeks,</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:13.931
<i>then every month for twelve months.</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:16.850
<i>And then every revolution
for the rest of their days.</i>

00:16.850 --> 00:18.644
<i>On their 21st revolution,</i>

00:18.644 --> 00:21.480
<i>beings celebrate in a raucous
and carefree manner.</i>

00:21.480 --> 00:24.024
<i>But starting sometime around
the 25th revolution,</i>

00:24.024 --> 00:26.109
<i>beings go from celebrating freely</i>

00:26.109 --> 00:28.946
<i>to assessing the status
of their entire existence.</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:36.620
<i>Joyful emergence day, offspring.</i>

00:36.620 --> 00:38.789
<i>I remember turning 25 revolutions.</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:41.041
<i>That was when I got my big promotion
at work,</i>

00:41.041 --> 00:44.795
<i>and we entered into our lifelong
partnership and traveled the planet.</i>

00:44.795 --> 00:46.505
<i>Then you emerged.</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:48.757
<i>We all see how much of a rut you're in.</i>

00:48.757 --> 00:51.885
<i>So we wanted to get you a little
something to help you get off the couch.</i>

00:51.885 --> 00:55.305
<i>We know you don't like the outdoors,
or going to a gym, or gardening,</i>

00:55.305 --> 00:57.015
<i>or anything like that.</i>

00:57.015 --> 00:59.977
<i>But we thought it could be nice for you
to get back out there.</i>

00:59.977 --> 01:04.313
<i>Maybe eventually give us some
super offspring of our own.</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:08.527
<i>Okay. Enjoy your gift.
We gotta go. Love you.</i>

01:11.697 --> 01:14.283
<i>To begin, select your voice preference.</i>

01:14.283 --> 01:16.368
My voice preference?

01:16.368 --> 01:18.579
<i>I heard you say, "My voice."</i>

01:18.579 --> 01:22.416
- What? No. That's not what I--
- <i>Greetings. I have replicated your voice.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:24.334
Is that what I sound like?

01:24.334 --> 01:27.713
<i>It is. Would you like me
to begin counting your steps?</i>

01:28.505 --> 01:29.590
Sure. I guess.

01:29.590 --> 01:32.301
<i>You have taken zero steps.</i>

01:39.516 --> 01:42.186
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

01:42.186 --> 01:44.104
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

01:44.771 --> 01:47.357
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

01:47.357 --> 01:49.026
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

01:50.027 --> 01:52.279
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

01:52.279 --> 01:55.199
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

01:55.199 --> 01:57.618
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

01:57.618 --> 02:00.204
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

02:00.204 --> 02:02.497
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

02:11.882 --> 02:13.675
Smile for your picture.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.512
I see it's your emergence day.

02:16.512 --> 02:17.971
Yeah.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.515
Joyful emergence day.

02:19.515 --> 02:22.768
Just a few more questions
for the application. Occupation?

02:22.768 --> 02:25.354
I'm kind of figuring that out right now.

02:25.354 --> 02:27.564
Would you like an extra key fob
for your partner?

02:27.564 --> 02:31.193
I have recently been uninvited
from my relationship.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.613
Just before your emergence day.
That's brutal.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.032
How would you describe
your current level of activity?

02:37.616 --> 02:39.993
I just got this device
to answer that very question.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.995
How am I doing, device?

02:41.995 --> 02:45.123
<i>Not very active. Sedentary. Inert.</i>

02:45.123 --> 02:47.000
Okay. Gratitude.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.089
<i>Slothful. Stationary.
Idle. Motionless. Does not apply.</i>

02:56.426 --> 02:58.262
We deceived you!

03:01.974 --> 03:05.227
That's exactly how you should say it
when our guest of honor arrives.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.526
I want this to be
the best deception party ever.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.945
If we succeed at this,
then our friend will feel loved,

03:14.945 --> 03:16.572
which might reduce their pain.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.699
My super offspring is in pain?

03:18.699 --> 03:21.618
Their pain is existential.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.163
Does everyone know
what they're doing when that door opens?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.498
We start with...

03:26.498 --> 03:27.916
Tiny trash.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.294
After which you will begin playing...

03:30.294 --> 03:34.798
<i>Revolutions are great
If you like them, that's great</i>

03:34.798 --> 03:37.885
<i>If you don't then we're sorry</i>

03:37.885 --> 03:39.970
<i>But we're here, it's too late</i>

03:39.970 --> 03:42.389
<i>We just like you, here's cake</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:46.226
Perfect.

03:49.438 --> 03:53.317
We ask our members to clean themselves
prior to sweating all over the machines.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.651
That make sense.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.654
I forgot the last application question.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.365
What made you decide
on a membership here at Hoist?

04:02.201 --> 04:06.371
I guess because it's my emergence day,
and that's making me reassess some things.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.582
My health, my life path.

04:08.582 --> 04:11.502
I've been around our star 25 times,
but I haven't done much.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.546
I guess I'm wondering
if I'm going anywhere,

04:14.546 --> 04:16.923
or if I'm just stuck.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.841
Cool.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.221
I'll check the box for New Revolution's
resolution. Same idea.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.974
<i>Sensing unusually high activity.</i>

04:25.974 --> 04:30.771
<i>You may feel like perishing, but this
is actually a standard pace for most.</i>

04:34.107 --> 04:36.568
Wait. Where's the giant sweet spiller?

04:36.568 --> 04:37.736
Here it is.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.906
You can hear the sweets
waiting to be spilled.

04:41.490 --> 04:42.449
That's not big enough.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.493
Our friend's blood pump
was recently fractured,

04:44.493 --> 04:48.747
and fracturing a blood-pump-shaped sweet
spiller could be very cathartic for them.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.500
Smashing a blood pump to pieces
is cathartic?

04:51.500 --> 04:53.293
I don't know. It's a metaphor.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.546
- I don't get it.
- Well,

04:55.546 --> 04:58.507
once we have the larger sweet spiller,
it'll all make sense, hopefully.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.133
I will attempt this mission,

05:00.133 --> 05:02.511
but I'm going to eat all the sweets
inside this one.

05:04.805 --> 05:08.433
Okay. I need quiet. I'm about to start
phase one of our deception.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.272
Greets.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.065
Joyful emergence day.

05:15.065 --> 05:18.652
<i>Gratitude. I think
you're the only being who remembered.</i>

05:20.279 --> 05:22.114
I'm sure no one has forgotten.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.742
Are you dressed?
Our table at Careful Now should be ready.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.703
- <i>Sure.
- I'll see you there.</i>

05:30.038 --> 05:32.916
They clearly have no idea
we all care about them.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.293
Deception!

05:36.295 --> 05:37.546
I'm worried about them.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.215
I am too. But don't worry. I have a plan.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.942
It's really nice of you to take me here.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.195
Of course. It's your special day.

06:01.195 --> 06:04.698
I got a little promotion at my vocation,
so my treat.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.366
You did.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.245
That's great. Many congratulations.

06:10.245 --> 06:14.708
Gratitude. It's very small
but headed in the right direction.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.629
Hey, you're headed
in the right direction too.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.923
<i>You are not headed in any direction.</i>

06:23.592 --> 06:26.887
I'm tired of feeling stuck
and doing the same old things.

06:26.887 --> 06:30.098
I want to go outside
and have different experiences.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.434
What? Where are you going?

06:32.434 --> 06:33.560
To live.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.812
It's fun, right?

06:35.812 --> 06:38.190
Oh, yes. But--

06:38.190 --> 06:40.400
I just love the wind in my face.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.446
Yes, but we should probably head--

06:45.030 --> 06:46.031
Wow.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.491
Have we--

06:48.450 --> 06:50.160
Okay. Have we lived yet?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.961
And that should do it.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.922
Surely we have now lived.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.006
Not yet.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.011
Not yet.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.682
Can't wait. It's gonna look so good.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.268
No, don't touch me. I changed my mind.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.397
It's not easy, is it?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.983
Loving it, though.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.235
I feel like we're going in circles.
Do you?

07:23.235 --> 07:25.445
What an emergence day.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.656
Maybe we go back to my apartment now.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.827
Not yet. I--

07:31.827 --> 07:33.871
Hey, look. One of those old call booths.

07:33.871 --> 07:36.206
You haven't truly lived
until you've been inside one.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.291
Okay.

07:42.838 --> 07:46.008
Okay, did you just see someone
go by carrying a giant blood pump?

07:46.842 --> 07:50.470
No. This reminds me of my first apartment.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.723
Reminds me of my current apartment.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.017
Shall we call it a day?

07:55.017 --> 07:57.644
Not yet.
There's one more thing I wanna do.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.321
I've always been afraid
to ride on one of these things.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.656
- Thank you for indulging me.
- Uh-huh.

08:10.741 --> 08:13.076
You can see the whole city from up here.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.831
Being this high
is equally beautiful and terrifying,

08:17.831 --> 08:21.877
and there's cute music playing. And...

08:23.170 --> 08:24.588
It makes me want to vom.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.261
I think we're stuck.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.056
Great.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.808
Stuck with no real employment,
stuck without a partner,

08:37.808 --> 08:39.852
stuck on a group dangle machine.

08:39.852 --> 08:44.232
No amount of getting back out there
can change this.

08:44.232 --> 08:47.528
It's vital to say calm.
It's probably just a glomrock outage.

08:48.612 --> 08:49.696
Are you okay?

08:49.696 --> 08:52.866
Yes. This is all really nice.

08:52.866 --> 08:56.203
I just don't feel like I have a lot
to celebrate this revolution.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.996
We are celebrating you.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.082
Yes, but who am I?

09:00.082 --> 09:01.667
You are my best friend.

09:01.667 --> 09:06.797
Your best friend who is 25 revolutions
and has nothing to show for it.

09:06.797 --> 09:08.966
No need to be so hard on yourself.

09:08.966 --> 09:12.469
Twenty-five revolutions
is still a small amount of revolutions.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.763
You have so many more revolutions
ahead of you.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.642
I texted my lifegivers
and they said it was a glomrock outage.

09:18.642 --> 09:21.228
They say it's not dangerous
and we'll be moving soon.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.729
They asked if you were creepy.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.566
I said yes,
but that it's your emergence day.

09:26.525 --> 09:29.361
They said, "Joyful emergence day."

09:30.362 --> 09:31.405
Both of them said it.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.323
- Gratitude.
- We're not creepy.

09:39.580 --> 09:44.418
Yes. Hello, dangle machine operator.

09:44.418 --> 09:48.172
Lucky they had your number
and knew we were stuck. What are the odds?

09:48.172 --> 09:51.008
Thanks for calling me for some reason. Weird.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.927
Yes, we are stuck in the air. What's that?

09:54.428 --> 09:57.848
Good. We will be moving soon.

09:57.848 --> 09:59.600
Sorry. I'll explain later.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.268
Oh, my. Are you okay?

10:01.268 --> 10:06.023
Should we all come to your rescue instead
of spilling mild poison on your couch?

10:06.023 --> 10:07.691
Which couch? What mild poison?

10:07.691 --> 10:08.817
Wait, just--

10:08.817 --> 10:11.361
If beings start getting restless,
can you make sure they don't leave?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.573
I can't use force,
but I'll call my friends.

10:14.573 --> 10:16.074
They always liven things up.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.205
Where are you? It's joyful hour.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.956
When did joyful hour begin?

10:22.956 --> 10:24.958
The day I retired.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.628
The whole gang is here.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.796
Great. Why don't you bring them all here?

10:29.796 --> 10:32.591
There's a deception party
for my super offspring.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.344
<i>Send me the details.</i>

10:35.344 --> 10:38.472
Joyful hour is on the move.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.098
Yeah.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.478
What are you looking at?

10:44.478 --> 10:46.813
My neighborhood, my apartment.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.315
It all looks so small.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.902
Yes, that is because of distance.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.989
By the time they were my age,
my lifegivers traveled the planet.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.407
Well, we know what they're like.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.992
Their standards don't make sense.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.745
I'm sorry they gave you
such an obnoxious gift.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.665
I bet you accrue a normal amount of steps.

11:04.665 --> 11:07.209
- <i>Would you like to know?</i>
- Yeah, that's not necessary.

11:07.209 --> 11:13.757
<i>Your current number of
steps is 90% below the regional average.</i>

11:15.509 --> 11:17.970
That can't be right. Look, you live there,

11:17.970 --> 11:20.264
and there is where you get
your jitter liquid,

11:20.264 --> 11:23.100
and then back again.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.519
I can fling your device
from this gap in the window.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.354
Thanks. That's okay.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.107
It is a good reminder
that I have nothing going for me.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.442
When we get off this thing,

11:32.442 --> 11:35.195
let's salvage the day
with a quiet night back at my apartment.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.947
Yes. Thank you.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.919
Are we moving? We're moving.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.045
Oh, thank orb.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.381
Yes.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.057
Joyful emergence day.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.894
This time from me, not just my lifegivers.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.937
Turns out being stuck
in a group dangle machine

12:08.937 --> 12:10.856
with two creeps isn't that bad after all.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.191
Gratitude.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.319
- Wait. That should not be your takeaway.
- Stop calling us creeps.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.658
Finally, we made it to my apartment.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.660
I think I'm just gonna go home.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.954
Thank you for an eventful emergence day.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.956
I think you should come in.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.417
I appreciate you
trying to make me feel better.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.463
But it seems the orb is trying to tell me
today isn't the day I become unstuck.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.256
But I got you fondue.

12:36.882 --> 12:37.883
Okay, fine.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.012
We deceived you!

12:43.055 --> 12:45.682
Hip, hip, tiny trash.

12:45.682 --> 12:46.975
What's going on?

12:46.975 --> 12:50.020
It's a deception party
for your emergence day.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.772
Deception!

12:52.856 --> 12:56.026
You all had me convinced
that you did not care about me.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.070
- Hooray!
- Then we succeeded.

12:58.070 --> 13:01.490
- I told you I was out of town for work.
- That felt very possible.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.243
I told you last week
that I was feeling sick.

13:04.243 --> 13:05.327
I sent you soup.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.371
I told you I broke my limb.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.835
There was no reason
to think that wasn't true.

13:12.835 --> 13:17.673
All this lack of caring is so thoughtful. Gratitude.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.266
Let us clink mild poisons
to acknowledge your special day.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.518
- Yeah! All right.
- Festive.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.897
Okay. I made this for you.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.651
I invited them when your head was turned.
I thought you'd find it funny.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.987
- Didn't think they'd come, though.
- Wow.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.116
It was a picture of me,
but I zoomed in on you.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.743
This is very kind.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.914
I'm going to handpat this creature,
because it's perfect.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.128
Hey, I think you will like
another surprise I have for you.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.177
Super Lifegiver.

14:03.177 --> 14:06.263
Tiny trash. Hi, honey.

14:07.973 --> 14:10.767
I thought you forgot my emergence day.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.979
Are you kidding me?
My memory isn't that bad yet.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.731
I'm just a great deceiver.

14:15.731 --> 14:17.524
If you need me, I'll be putting out fires.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.443
Hopefully, not literal ones.

14:23.947 --> 14:27.492
You seem a little down
for someone having a big celebration.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.329
I have no idea
what I'm doing with my life.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.207
Can I share with you
a little lesson I learned?

14:33.207 --> 14:34.291
Sure.

14:34.291 --> 14:37.252
The challenging moments
in your life are just that.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.253
Challenging?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.880
Moments, sweetie.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.965
They are moments in time that will pass,

14:41.965 --> 14:44.426
and eventually
you'll barely remember them.

14:44.426 --> 14:45.969
The bad moments will pass.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.930
Even the good moments will pass.

14:47.930 --> 14:53.268
But everything you do and experience,
that's what our existence is all about.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.646
I just feel so stuck.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.732
Hey, you there. Have you ever felt stuck?

14:58.732 --> 15:02.402
Stuck? Well, sure.
I've been stuck, many times.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.821
I designed machinery for so long,

15:04.821 --> 15:08.283
I started to believe
I may be a machine myself.

15:08.283 --> 15:11.954
I was stuck in a job
and felt like I lost a part of myself.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.331
I was stuck on an island once.

15:14.331 --> 15:19.044
Took folks a few days to discover
that my ship was wrecked in a storm.

15:19.044 --> 15:22.756
Once I was stuck in a ship.
A relationship.

15:24.591 --> 15:28.345
When I feel stuck,
I like to dance until I feel free again.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.849
Come on.
Why don't we go slice up a floor covering?

15:39.022 --> 15:42.276
<i>You are limbshaking. Go, go.</i>

15:42.276 --> 15:46.238
<i>Wave your hands in the air, without
regard for what others are thinking.</i>

15:52.953 --> 15:54.997
The giant sweet spiller.

15:55.539 --> 16:00.169
I figured we could destroy it to mend
your broken blood pump metaphorically.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.713
You really are my best friend.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.428
They're tartnoggins.

16:09.428 --> 16:10.929
- Tartnoggins.
- Grab me a perpcorn.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.642
I think you should look around this room
at all these friends who love you

16:15.642 --> 16:17.769
if you want to see how far you've come.

16:19.354 --> 16:20.731
Still feeling stuck?

16:20.731 --> 16:24.151
The solidarity in this room
makes me hopeful.

16:24.693 --> 16:25.986
Well, there you go.

16:25.986 --> 16:29.990
Anytime you need that
hopeful feeling recharged, I'll be here.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.411
Attention, beings.

16:35.370 --> 16:39.249
I've been feeling down lately
about my life circumstances.

16:39.249 --> 16:43.170
It led me to a spiral of mild
to moderate despair.

16:43.170 --> 16:49.134
Seeing your faces tonight was genuinely
unexpected and unexpectedly inspiring.

16:49.134 --> 16:52.095
I'd been pining for something unknown
and intangible,

16:52.095 --> 16:56.391
but your presence reminded me
that I've had all I've ever truly needed.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.685
Because of how supportive you've been,

16:58.685 --> 17:00.187
I know that being honest with you

17:00.187 --> 17:03.440
and sharing my true feelings
will be received kindly.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.901
This isn't a normal emergence day speech,
I guess,

17:05.901 --> 17:10.696
but I just wanted to say how grateful I am
for all of our friendships.

17:10.696 --> 17:13.575
Thank you,
from the bottom of my blood pump.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.454
Tiny fires.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.832
Joyful emergence day, super offspring.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.416
Gratitude.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.461
And gratitude to you.

17:24.461 --> 17:26.588
No one could have thrown a better party.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.507
It's always great to hear that.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.009
Please say it again.
Like, five more times.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.929
Extinguish! Extinguish!

17:37.641 --> 17:39.518
Twenty-five revolutions.

17:39.518 --> 17:41.103
How are you feeling?

17:41.103 --> 17:42.354
I'm doing great.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.398
<i>Let's not get ahead of ourselves.</i>

17:48.360 --> 17:49.820
<i>Blood pump rate increasing.</i>

17:51.572 --> 17:53.490
<i>You're really moving now.</i>

17:53.490 --> 17:57.494
<i>Good job.
Blood pump rate rapidly increasing.</i>

17:57.494 --> 17:58.996
<i>I knew you could do it.</i>
