www.sub-way.fr/www.seriessub.com

01:20.994 --> 01:22.008
Fuckers.

02:28.261 --> 02:29.240
Fredster!

02:31.324 --> 02:33.320
This stuff is fucking rubbish,
by the way.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.432
Stop stealing my fucking spliff!

02:37.159 --> 02:39.200
Morning, gents,
you thieving bastards.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.287
Come on, I got you some breakfast.

02:46.390 --> 02:48.503
They allowed to serve lager
at 8 in the morning?

02:48.623 --> 02:49.799
I had a word...

02:51.360 --> 02:54.364
JJ's got some interesting thoughts
on the benefits of Carlsberg

02:54.484 --> 02:56.486
as part of a balanced
dietary pattern.

02:58.072 --> 03:01.079
Calorifically it's right up there
with 392 energy units,

03:01.199 --> 03:03.200
which is nothing
on the Snickers Duo I'm having

03:03.360 --> 03:05.599
which has the additional drawback
of 28 grams of fat.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.240
Although I can call upon
1.2 grams of fibre,

03:08.421 --> 03:10.880
which doesn't feature
in your lager. However,

03:11.203 --> 03:14.600
you could argue in some sense that
hops constitute one of your five a day.

03:14.837 --> 03:16.030
That'll do me.

03:22.907 --> 03:24.381
You not having that, Freds?

03:25.805 --> 03:27.120
That's his fourth so far.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.967
Is that a good idea?
We've college in half an hour.

03:30.087 --> 03:32.317
You'll be carrying an
attention deficit into the day.

03:32.437 --> 03:34.639
Attention deficit?
Intelligence deficit!

03:38.702 --> 03:39.439
Pig!

03:40.362 --> 03:41.836
Maybe I won't go then.

03:42.701 --> 03:44.514
You're going to bunk off
your first day?

03:45.109 --> 03:48.480
Mate, the sun's shining.
We're bevvied, spliffed and sorted.

03:48.752 --> 03:51.578
Feels like the beginning
of something. So I'm waiting.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.080
- For what?
- The signal.

03:53.261 --> 03:55.016
- We're starting college.
- We're waiting.

03:55.136 --> 03:57.361
- Something's gotta start us off.
- You're running

03:57.481 --> 03:59.283
a randomised fate model to determine

03:59.403 --> 04:01.159
when you continue
in full time education?

04:01.279 --> 04:02.678
I need motivation.

04:02.996 --> 04:06.339
And it needs to be better
than sitting in the sun, with you two,

04:06.459 --> 04:08.972
drinking beers
and smoking your blow. Jensie!

04:09.545 --> 04:10.920
Have the same again?

04:11.222 --> 04:13.626
And sling a couple of them
cherry shots on top?

04:13.746 --> 04:14.978
Cheers, darling.

04:18.473 --> 04:19.697
I can feel it!

04:20.224 --> 04:21.988
It's got potential, this day.

04:23.005 --> 04:24.245
It's pregnant.

04:33.430 --> 04:36.576
Shouldn't someone pick up
that bike before it causes an...?

04:42.432 --> 04:44.573
For fuck's sake!
Jesus shit!

04:45.538 --> 04:48.083
Where the fuck did that...?
What the fuck?

04:49.159 --> 04:51.534
Look at it! Look at it!

04:52.261 --> 04:53.901
Look at my fucking car!

04:54.596 --> 04:57.262
You saw that, didn't you?
Did you? Did you see it?

04:57.382 --> 05:00.099
I don't know.
You drove into the bollard.

05:00.354 --> 05:01.440
I did not!

05:01.621 --> 05:04.040
The fucking bike
jumped out in front of me!

05:04.613 --> 05:08.240
You must have seen it, you're
my witness, right? Are you blind?

05:08.421 --> 05:10.500
Why is everyone round here
fucking blind?

05:10.853 --> 05:13.800
- I'm doing nothing...
- That girl's looking at you, Freddie.

05:17.545 --> 05:20.551
- Maybe she's looking at me.
- She's not looking at you, JJ.

05:23.635 --> 05:24.658
Nice hair.

05:26.381 --> 05:28.637
She's got nice hair and nice eyes.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.200
- And nice breasts, probably.
- Shut up, JJ.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.320
Nipples.

05:34.675 --> 05:36.561
We'll just imagine her bottom.

05:36.956 --> 05:39.153
Where's your fucking
white stick, woman?

05:39.772 --> 05:41.360
She's absolutely lovely.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.969
You are as stupid as you look!
Ah, for fuck...

05:44.089 --> 05:46.840
- I want your mobile number.
- I don't have one.

05:47.021 --> 05:49.120
Your fucking email address, then!

05:49.301 --> 05:51.388
Look at the state of my fucking car!

05:51.508 --> 05:54.665
You must have seen something,
you demented bint!

05:55.826 --> 05:57.694
What...
What happened?

05:58.181 --> 06:00.366
Is that your bike,
you fucking idiot?

06:00.715 --> 06:02.762
I was signalling...
you just kept coming...

06:02.882 --> 06:06.040
I didn't even see you!
You came out of fucking nowhere!

06:06.221 --> 06:09.059
I was trying to make you see me.
You just kept coming, man!

06:09.321 --> 06:12.363
- No. That's bollocks. No. Listen!
- You fucked my bike.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.693
- You just ran straight through me.
- That is not right!

06:17.910 --> 06:19.563
You haven't got a witness.

06:20.341 --> 06:22.198
Nobody saw me
knock you off your bike.

06:22.318 --> 06:23.287
I did.

06:25.581 --> 06:27.928
It was just like he said!

06:28.937 --> 06:31.660
You ran him over,
and now he's bleeding.

06:32.061 --> 06:33.040
Profusely.

06:35.963 --> 06:39.280
Perhaps we should call a policeman.
{\I think }It's a crime to leave the scene of a...

06:39.461 --> 06:41.873
There's no need for that.
I'm sure we can sort this out.

06:41.993 --> 06:45.960
Let me buy you a new bike...
Look, here. Come on, take it!

06:46.141 --> 06:50.280
Take it! Come on, have the lot.
Have the whole fucking lot! Bollocks!

06:51.000 --> 06:53.867
Forgive and forget, okay?
Forgive and forget, okay?

06:54.961 --> 06:57.040
- All right.
- Everything all right, Gran?

06:58.543 --> 07:01.008
Just a slight problem,
all sorted out now.

07:01.291 --> 07:04.761
He's a pillock, he wrapped
his car around that bollard,

07:04.881 --> 07:07.260
and he's called me a demented bint.

07:07.380 --> 07:09.280
What the fuck did you say
to my Gran, man?

07:09.400 --> 07:10.760
Hello, nice to meet you...

07:10.941 --> 07:13.600
- Don't fucking, "Hello," me...
- Sweet.

07:22.179 --> 07:24.840
Dad says some things are best
left to the imagination.

07:25.021 --> 07:28.339
- But that's not right, is it?
- Your dad's a stupid tosser, JJ.

07:29.790 --> 07:32.298
Do you think she's going
where we're going?

07:33.209 --> 07:34.307
She is now.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.320
Mum! Mum! Emily hit me!

08:55.783 --> 08:58.645
- Emily? Are you hitting James?
- Sorry! Accident...

09:00.199 --> 09:01.475
That was my bloody widdler!

09:01.669 --> 09:03.669
Shut up or I'll tell her
what you were doing.

09:05.439 --> 09:08.454
I've got a natural curiosity
for a boy of my age.

09:08.669 --> 09:11.414
Fuck off. And I know it's you
stealing the knickers.

09:12.367 --> 09:14.454
They better not be sticky
when I find them.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.978
Get the fuck out of there, bitch!

09:24.438 --> 09:25.959
- Mum!
- Who?

09:27.229 --> 09:28.983
It's me, Emily.

09:29.757 --> 09:32.949
Tell her to get out of the shower.
She's making me late for college.

09:33.229 --> 09:36.451
Gotta dash. Remember to make
a packed lunch for James.

09:36.869 --> 09:39.251
- Why don't you get Katie to...?
- Good luck at college.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.787
Remember to smile.

09:50.374 --> 09:51.654
Fucking hell!

10:00.637 --> 10:03.094
You've used all the fucking water!

10:04.709 --> 10:05.788
Jesus! Shit!

10:09.469 --> 10:10.694
For fuck's sake!

10:11.110 --> 10:12.774
You pervy little bastard.

10:13.586 --> 10:15.379
She's gone to work, loser.

10:16.829 --> 10:19.654
Fucking hell. How many times
are you gonna do that?

10:20.009 --> 10:22.037
I need to wash my hair and you've...

10:22.486 --> 10:24.414
I knew this top
would look fucking bad-ass.

10:24.746 --> 10:25.882
It's mine.

10:27.058 --> 10:28.908
Aren't you glad I made you buy it?

10:30.280 --> 10:32.637
Get dressed, though.
We're gonna be late.

10:35.341 --> 10:38.854
I dunno where you got this thong,
but it's properly cutting me in half.

10:39.130 --> 10:41.312
- You could give it back.
- Sorry.

10:41.692 --> 10:43.821
You know it doesn't
look as good on you.

10:44.573 --> 10:45.848
There's Danny.

10:46.464 --> 10:48.774
Hey, cutey!
I'm just coming.

10:50.193 --> 10:52.654
I'm telling you, college? First day?

10:52.869 --> 10:54.193
You need to get ready.

10:55.038 --> 10:56.963
Cos we're not waiting for you.

11:08.431 --> 11:10.614
- What about my packed lunch?
- Fuck off.

11:12.177 --> 11:14.574
You shave your fanny
with Dad's Gillette Mach3.

11:39.116 --> 11:41.510
So Tommo goes up the inside, right?

11:41.956 --> 11:44.302
I drop back to cover
Marco and Keeno.

11:44.422 --> 11:46.738
Took a one-two from Jonno,
he's gone, "Danno!"

11:46.858 --> 11:48.613
So I drag back over the ball.

11:48.733 --> 11:51.049
Looked up, chipped
the centre back... Boff!

11:51.169 --> 11:52.837
Sambo's in on goal.

11:53.975 --> 11:57.693
He's got a lovely sense of rhythm.
Where's your knickers, girl?

11:57.909 --> 12:00.362
That's for me to know
and you to find out, Danny.

12:00.572 --> 12:02.522
Nice one! Nice one, yeah?

12:24.049 --> 12:25.614
Score one for me, honey.

12:25.991 --> 12:27.174
Laters, babe.

12:28.502 --> 12:29.587
See you, Danny.

12:34.524 --> 12:36.129
Renault Megane Coupe!

12:37.883 --> 12:39.014
Fucking bag...

12:39.365 --> 12:40.407
Here, Ems?

12:42.917 --> 12:46.014
You oughta spruce up, yeah?
Get some decent threads like Katie.

12:46.720 --> 12:49.908
We're having a party in the Premier
Travel Lodge on Thursday.

12:50.028 --> 12:52.174
Party fun, yeah? The lads,

12:52.660 --> 12:54.613
they love a twin thing, you know?

12:58.193 --> 13:00.614
That's sweet of you, Danny.
Can I get back to you on that?

13:01.326 --> 13:03.014
Yeah, yeah. Nice one.

13:08.761 --> 13:11.054
Are you Danny?
That gas-head footy player?

13:11.764 --> 13:14.015
My mate Janice wants
you to sign her tits.

13:14.135 --> 13:16.425
- Let me park up.
- Your boyfriend's well mint.

13:16.637 --> 13:17.997
He's totally fit.

13:18.117 --> 13:21.140
He took me to the Stakis Grand
last week for surf, turf and shots.

13:22.449 --> 13:24.094
- Safe.
- I love Danny Guillermo.

13:24.309 --> 13:26.334
- Lush. Good lush.
- Foxy.

13:26.582 --> 13:28.828
- Cute.
- He's signing Samantha's tits!

13:28.948 --> 13:29.962
Bonkers!

13:31.136 --> 13:32.535
What's surf and turf, Eff?

13:33.482 --> 13:34.337
Sex.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.073
We'll have a whizzer time
at this college, Eff!

13:37.193 --> 13:39.265
I'm definitely going
to have surf and turf, ASAP.

13:39.385 --> 13:41.809
Mum says boys only want one thing
so my plan is give it to them,

13:41.929 --> 13:44.955
lots of times. That way I'll get good
at it, be really popular

13:45.075 --> 13:47.013
and maybe my toes
will stop throbbing.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.319
Christ's sakes, Ems.
Come on, you loser!

13:51.552 --> 13:54.389
What's wrong with you?
You're always lagging behind me.

13:54.509 --> 13:56.746
Why can't you wear decent clothes?

13:57.914 --> 13:58.750
Right.

13:59.446 --> 14:01.574
- You hate her.
- Who do I hate, Eff?

14:02.759 --> 14:04.590
- I'll let you know.
- Cool.

14:05.722 --> 14:08.190
- Let's get this party started.
- You want a lollipop?

14:34.602 --> 14:35.926
She smiled at me.

14:36.768 --> 14:40.054
- Cool.
- She... didn't smile at you, JJ.

14:40.768 --> 14:42.491
I think you'll find she did.

14:42.954 --> 14:46.823
Mum was right. A lack of pubic hair
isn't necessarily a drawback.

14:47.224 --> 14:49.036
It is a drawback.

14:50.518 --> 14:52.974
Girls are more interested
in my character than my cock.

14:53.189 --> 14:56.263
- That's just been proved.
- She was not looking at you.

14:56.741 --> 14:58.440
Fuck me, you're blind.

14:59.310 --> 15:01.620
On the contrary.
My eyesight is keen.

15:05.374 --> 15:06.974
How many fingers am I holding up?

15:07.161 --> 15:07.996
F...

15:08.806 --> 15:11.586
- You always do that...!
- I've got so much cock hair

15:11.706 --> 15:13.961
I can back comb it
and use it like a lure.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.066
Nice.

15:19.266 --> 15:20.579
Like a Porcupine.

15:20.842 --> 15:23.048
Right, you're all prick.

15:24.329 --> 15:26.614
- Toosh.
- You mean touche.

15:28.797 --> 15:29.653
Probably.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.404
- Tosser.
- Nice.

15:41.297 --> 15:42.446
Here we go.

15:42.566 --> 15:45.134
<i>Welcome to Roundview College.</i>

15:45.505 --> 15:48.414
<i>A meeting place for young people.</i>

15:59.858 --> 16:01.241
God help me.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.799
Lovely kids. So full of energy.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.551
Makes you feel alive.

16:05.671 --> 16:08.175
They look like a right peck
of fuckers to me.

16:09.389 --> 16:12.361
If I suddenly get a bit flushed
and short of breath,

16:12.481 --> 16:14.923
- take over, would you, Doug?
- Why would you get flushed?

16:15.043 --> 16:16.374
Just fucking do it, okay?

16:16.626 --> 16:19.174
No problem. Flushed. Right you are.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.307
Could I have your attention, please?

16:24.415 --> 16:26.603
Yes, we are starting.

16:31.709 --> 16:32.722
<i>Attention!</i>

16:33.292 --> 16:35.571
<i>Pay attention, look you!</i>

16:39.322 --> 16:40.552
Thank you, Doug.

16:42.965 --> 16:45.134
Welcome to Roundview College.

16:45.853 --> 16:49.740
We are a designated four star
educational establishment

16:49.860 --> 16:53.053
under the National
We're All In It Together Initiative

16:53.594 --> 16:56.603
leading to Ultimate Improvement status.

16:56.869 --> 17:00.564
Anyone who screws that up
will be officially burnt at the stake.

17:00.684 --> 17:03.144
- And expelled.
- Yes, and expelled.

17:03.594 --> 17:07.522
God help you all, you're gonna get
some qualifications. Any questions?

17:09.094 --> 17:10.013
Thank you.

17:10.765 --> 17:13.471
Now before I turn you over
to your form tutors,

17:13.590 --> 17:16.978
I'd like to tell you something about
the way in which we organise our...

17:17.098 --> 17:18.609
Right! Very funny.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.920
This is a further education college,
not a primary school.

17:24.272 --> 17:25.980
Stop it! Stop it!

17:26.099 --> 17:28.820
I'll cut your balls off,
you cheeky little turds!

17:29.291 --> 17:30.427
You hear me?

17:33.441 --> 17:34.765
I do apologise.

17:36.739 --> 17:38.476
I think I might be at fault.

17:39.336 --> 17:41.654
Too much rhubarb
on my Ready Brek. Havoc.

17:43.586 --> 17:44.294
Right.

17:44.573 --> 17:47.454
You are looking a little flushed.
Do you want me to...?

18:06.598 --> 18:10.352
Last year, we had
some intolerable incidents

18:10.472 --> 18:13.527
so, I want to make this
easy for you.

18:14.248 --> 18:17.823
The following will result
in instant expulsion:

18:18.221 --> 18:20.979
smoking on the premises,
setting fire to the premises,

18:21.099 --> 18:22.873
consumption of alcohol
on the premises,

18:22.993 --> 18:25.669
consumption of drugs on the premises,
consumption of pornography

18:25.789 --> 18:28.894
on the premises, teacher abuse,
glue abuse, self abuse,

18:29.054 --> 18:32.728
sexual intercourse with any other
student, teacher or animal

18:32.848 --> 18:34.851
or combination of the above

18:34.971 --> 18:37.174
including oral sex

18:37.294 --> 18:40.694
and/or use of sex toys,
on the premises.

18:40.909 --> 18:42.193
That was nasty...

18:42.584 --> 18:45.879
Miss Reedy, our new head
of communications.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.827
Miss Reedy is joining us from...

18:50.220 --> 18:52.058
Where are you joining us from?

18:52.641 --> 18:54.223
I had some time off.

18:55.220 --> 18:56.294
Seven years.

18:56.509 --> 19:00.164
It was stress-related but feeling
a bit better now, hopefully...

19:02.785 --> 19:04.021
Oh, Christ.

19:06.772 --> 19:07.770
Form...

19:08.195 --> 19:09.495
BD1,

19:10.308 --> 19:12.538
say your name, please, when I...

19:13.924 --> 19:17.832
Put your hands up, please,
when I call your...

19:19.004 --> 19:19.814
name.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.003
Emily Fitch?

19:25.982 --> 19:27.259
Katie Fitch?

19:28.135 --> 19:30.734
Jonah Jeremia Jones?

19:31.440 --> 19:32.698
JJ, present.

19:33.469 --> 19:34.494
James Cook?

19:37.031 --> 19:38.525
Elizabeth Stonem?

19:40.043 --> 19:42.146
Mavis Jarundi?

19:45.029 --> 19:48.024
Dob... rislawa W...

19:48.677 --> 19:51.334
Wieczorek?
I'm sorry, you're foreign.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.105
Frederick McLair?

19:56.354 --> 19:58.627
Denise Adebeyor?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.273
The integrity
of the unit is preserved.

20:02.083 --> 20:05.410
I'm still deeply unhappy with you, mind,
on account of the unwarranted violence.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.255
All right, I said I'm sorry.

20:08.034 --> 20:08.991
And...

20:10.278 --> 20:11.593
Naomi Campbell?

20:20.665 --> 20:21.999
Fucking hell...

20:28.372 --> 20:30.294
Now I get it. You got
anger management issues.

20:30.553 --> 20:32.842
- Only when I talk to wankers.
- Cool.

20:34.069 --> 20:35.934
You gonna hit me
with your shoe now, or...?

20:40.438 --> 20:41.565
I like her.

20:47.278 --> 20:50.001
Christ. Same fucking form.

21:00.328 --> 21:02.515
Sorry. I'm not a babe.

21:03.165 --> 21:04.974
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

21:05.189 --> 21:08.173
- Shut up, Cook. Sorry about him.
- Listen, trying to break the ice.

21:09.005 --> 21:10.865
Guess what I've got tattooed
on my cock?

21:10.985 --> 21:12.374
No, go on. Guess.

21:13.129 --> 21:15.054
- What would you say?
- Excuse me?

21:15.630 --> 21:16.654
Yes? What is it?

21:16.869 --> 21:18.773
The boy next to me
is acting inappropriately.

21:19.020 --> 21:19.894
How?

21:20.109 --> 21:21.846
He wants to show me his tattoo.

21:22.149 --> 21:24.134
- And not in a nice way.
- Right.

21:24.911 --> 21:26.074
- You!
- Me?

21:27.593 --> 21:30.320
Why don't you show us all
your pathetic tattoo?

21:30.440 --> 21:33.275
We can wonder
at its magnificent stupidity.

21:33.395 --> 21:34.883
I don't think you'd like it.

21:35.003 --> 21:36.884
<i>Right lad! Smartish!</i>

21:37.004 --> 21:40.816
<i>You've had an instruction.
Show her the tattoo, now!</i>

21:41.860 --> 21:42.874
All right.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.974
Wait. No, no, Cook, wait, no.
Please, please!

21:56.031 --> 21:58.134
That is fuckin' impressive,
so it is.

22:03.044 --> 22:03.934
Let me out!

22:04.149 --> 22:06.449
Let me out! Don't make me stay.

22:06.669 --> 22:08.008
Let me out!

22:09.746 --> 22:10.934
This is unacceptable.

22:12.670 --> 22:13.975
Unacceptable!

22:15.063 --> 22:16.062
Silence.

22:16.182 --> 22:17.534
Silence! Silence!

22:17.749 --> 22:20.238
You, silence!

22:37.570 --> 22:39.128
I do apologise again.

22:42.649 --> 22:44.897
If I see your face
in this office again...

22:47.025 --> 22:48.029
Get out!

22:48.248 --> 22:49.328
Get out!

22:49.957 --> 22:51.544
Get out!

22:55.725 --> 22:57.676
- Did she expel you?
- For what?

22:57.796 --> 22:59.546
Getting your cock out in Assembly.

22:59.666 --> 23:02.026
I'm guessing, but it's possibly
frowned upon.

23:02.229 --> 23:04.615
- Even in the state sector.
- She understood the bind I was in.

23:04.735 --> 23:07.110
I was doing what I was told.
Very accommodating.

23:07.230 --> 23:10.421
There was something about removing
my bollocks with a monkey wrench

23:10.541 --> 23:11.956
if she ever saw them again.

23:12.446 --> 23:14.549
I think we reached an understanding.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.045
Right. To business.

23:17.165 --> 23:19.421
- You mean education?
- Women, JJ.

23:19.541 --> 23:20.280
Women?

23:22.381 --> 23:24.293
I mean, I feel like we might be...

23:24.413 --> 23:27.640
I don't want to sort of run
before I can... walk...

23:32.905 --> 23:33.929
Girls!

23:39.314 --> 23:41.297
- There's a lot of them.
- Yep.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.929
So much choice.
It's disconcerting.

23:45.049 --> 23:48.359
No, it's just a matter of sorting
out the wheat from the chavs.

23:49.113 --> 23:50.360
There we are.

23:51.694 --> 23:54.144
And the wolf shall lie down
with the lamb.

23:56.237 --> 23:57.960
You think she'd lie down with me?

24:01.940 --> 24:05.154
Well, that line is wrong and popularly
misquoted. It should read:

24:05.274 --> 24:07.440
"The wolf also shall dwell
with the lamb, and the leopard

24:07.615 --> 24:10.105
"shall lie down with the kid,
and the calf and the young lion

24:10.225 --> 24:12.802
"and the fatted calf together
and a little child shall lead them."

24:13.895 --> 24:15.743
We'll try and pick
the bones out of that.

24:17.808 --> 24:19.672
I could show her one
of my magic tricks.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.685
Dad says it's an ice-breaker.

24:21.805 --> 24:23.905
Let's try that out, then,
before we go leaping in,

24:24.025 --> 24:26.296
and we can see
who gets the fatted calf, right?

24:28.003 --> 24:28.840
Yeah, you.

24:29.015 --> 24:32.963
Darling, my mate wants to try out
his pick-up routine on you. That okay?

24:34.546 --> 24:35.383
I'm JJ.

24:35.503 --> 24:37.761
Pack of cards.
Nothing funny about them.

24:37.881 --> 24:41.219
Except one minute
they're blue and...

24:49.148 --> 24:51.467
You don't mind
if I take this locker?

24:52.458 --> 24:54.440
You can take anything
if you want it enough.

24:55.305 --> 24:59.007
Great. Everything's new and I
suppose we should probably, like,

24:59.127 --> 25:01.486
you know,
all get to know each other.

25:01.606 --> 25:02.639
Why?

25:05.252 --> 25:06.252
I dunno.

25:08.127 --> 25:10.967
You definitely looked at me
this morning, twice.

25:11.126 --> 25:15.126
I just thought, you know, maybe
we could get to know each other.

25:15.422 --> 25:16.755
I look at lots of people.

25:16.875 --> 25:19.898
That doesn't mean
I want to get to know them.

25:26.702 --> 25:28.720
Do you want me to want
to get to know you?

25:29.887 --> 25:31.311
I wouldn't mind.

25:31.574 --> 25:34.160
Thing is, they want
to get to know me too.

25:38.778 --> 25:41.598
- They're just wankers.
- They're your best friends.

25:42.322 --> 25:45.360
- So they're my best friends.
- That makes it complicated.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.400
I was hoping not.

25:51.447 --> 25:52.640
I'm Freddie.

25:54.260 --> 25:55.599
Tell you what, Freddie.

26:00.911 --> 26:02.880
- Fill in a form.
- What's this?

26:03.214 --> 26:04.999
A list of things
we're not allowed to do.

26:05.174 --> 26:08.880
Like that head director said before
your bestest mate got his cock out.

26:09.699 --> 26:12.592
I was gonna see if I could tick 'em
all before the end of the day. But...

26:12.827 --> 26:14.726
this is much more interesting.

26:15.378 --> 26:18.110
First one to fill
that out gets to...

26:20.891 --> 26:22.187
get to know me.

26:24.328 --> 26:25.680
And no cheating.

26:26.014 --> 26:27.080
I'll need evidence.

26:29.085 --> 26:30.831
Cos I wouldn't fuck a cheat.

26:31.260 --> 26:32.275
Sorry?

26:42.752 --> 26:44.040
Now watch very closely.

26:47.045 --> 26:48.275
Where's it gone?

26:50.358 --> 26:51.766
- Presto!
- Presto!

26:51.886 --> 26:54.840
- Put that away before I lose it.
- Fuck me!

26:55.175 --> 26:57.317
Yes, that's alarming.
So I'll just...

27:00.174 --> 27:02.068
And the coup de grace.

27:02.566 --> 27:04.077
Prestissimo!

27:10.495 --> 27:11.491
Magic!

27:15.276 --> 27:18.572
Question is, pet, does that make
you want to give JJ a blowjob?

27:22.043 --> 27:24.323
Excuse me,
are you fucking deaf or something?

27:25.663 --> 27:27.879
Yes, I am deaf.
So why don't you

27:27.999 --> 27:30.385
give him a blowjob
if you love him so much?

27:30.505 --> 27:31.320
Tossers.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.778
Especially you.

27:36.157 --> 27:38.072
Who are we speaking to here?

27:38.598 --> 27:40.690
Pixie's lip reading.
I'm telling you what she says.

27:40.810 --> 27:42.344
Right, right. Cool.

27:44.595 --> 27:46.826
She's got tits like choccy Hob Nobs.

27:46.946 --> 27:49.560
I'd like to dunk 'em,
suck 'em and lick off the love.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.119
- I'm not sure...
- Droopy, lardy arse.

27:52.481 --> 27:54.875
Bit spready, bit low slung.
You get me?

27:55.798 --> 27:58.320
I think we've stumbled upon
a flaw in your thinking.

28:00.036 --> 28:01.779
Listen... I mean, wait.

28:02.534 --> 28:03.508
Hang on.

28:06.388 --> 28:09.560
Presto. You're cunting
small-balled arsehole bandit.

28:13.508 --> 28:16.239
She may be deaf,
she's also extremely rude.

28:28.167 --> 28:30.268
It's bloody annoying
they put us in different forms.

28:30.388 --> 28:32.239
I mean, I'm totally useless
and Mum says

28:32.359 --> 28:35.264
I have to do Hair & Beauty,
but I'm good at Philosophy, too.

28:35.384 --> 28:38.120
I can't understand
why I can't do Hair and Philosophy.

28:38.280 --> 28:41.429
You can't cos it turns out Hair &
Beauty is one subject, not two.

28:41.710 --> 28:43.827
Blooming Nora, how mad is that?

28:43.947 --> 28:47.404
- It's inexplicable, Pandora.
- Yeah. Inexplicable.

28:48.166 --> 28:50.641
- What does inexplicable mean, Eff?
- Can't explain.

28:50.761 --> 28:52.599
All right! Suit yourself, then.

29:04.736 --> 29:06.066
Hi, I'm Katie.

29:06.186 --> 29:08.160
I'm Bruno and what do you know?

29:10.640 --> 29:13.680
- Who's your friend?
- Pandora. You're a corker.

29:14.680 --> 29:15.700
Thanks...

29:17.177 --> 29:19.411
It's nice to... I got to go.

29:20.579 --> 29:23.919
Strewth! Do you think he'd do
surf and turf with me, Eff?

29:24.676 --> 29:25.879
- I'll ask.
- Gotta go.

29:26.215 --> 29:27.633
Lesson one, practical skills.

29:27.753 --> 29:29.559
Filing our nails - handy!

29:30.123 --> 29:32.200
I'm Pandora. I'm useless.

29:35.453 --> 29:36.336
Cute.

29:36.654 --> 29:38.921
I'm Katie, that's my sister.

29:39.747 --> 29:41.039
Aren't you Effy Stonem?

29:41.211 --> 29:43.800
- Haven't you got a really cool brother?
- He's cool.

29:43.962 --> 29:46.289
All my friends fancied him.
I wasn't so fussed.

29:46.409 --> 29:49.162
Didn't he go mental?
Anyway I've got a boyfriend.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.120
He plays for Bristol Rover reserves.

29:51.657 --> 29:55.079
- Impressive.
- He's well lush. Let's sit together.

29:55.283 --> 29:56.802
We can chat because, you know...

29:56.922 --> 29:59.760
We're the best-looking in here,
really. Sorry but we are.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.033
We should hang out.
Definitely.

30:03.042 --> 30:04.599
Oh, no, here it comes.

30:04.719 --> 30:06.239
Total lezzer bitch.

30:11.912 --> 30:13.106
Excuse me.

30:16.931 --> 30:18.439
Like, don't talk to her.

30:18.828 --> 30:20.961
She tried to snog my sister
at middle school.

30:21.448 --> 30:23.392
Pervy. Don't you think, Eff?

30:26.883 --> 30:29.361
Watch out, Katie.
I might get confused

30:29.680 --> 30:32.196
and fuck you with my big
strap-on by mistake.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.682
Muff-munching bitch.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.887
- Just jumped on you, didn't she...
- Leave it, Katie.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.113
Whatever.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.519
Come on.

30:43.982 --> 30:45.922
We'll get the best seats, yeah?

30:46.202 --> 30:46.882
So,

30:48.442 --> 30:49.602
you the doormat, then?

30:50.632 --> 30:51.616
Sort of.

30:52.007 --> 30:54.607
Interesting,
that you just put up with that.

31:00.201 --> 31:02.756
It's a challenging list.
You gotta give her that.

31:03.008 --> 31:06.698
- Sex in school. Tricky.
- Guys, we are now seven minutes...

31:06.818 --> 31:08.328
57, 58, 59...

31:08.530 --> 31:11.991
- eight minutes late for form induction.
- Shut up, will you, JJ?

31:12.632 --> 31:14.041
Do you think she's serious?

31:14.370 --> 31:16.285
There's only one way to find out.

31:17.659 --> 31:19.351
Wait a minute. You're not gonna...

31:19.471 --> 31:21.197
I've already got
"teacher abuse" ticked.

31:21.317 --> 31:24.055
And how! Your cock
should not be that colour.

31:26.566 --> 31:29.136
The game is on, Freddie.
You wanna play?

31:29.841 --> 31:32.771
- Don't be stupid.
- Tell you what, girls like Stupid.

31:33.214 --> 31:36.682
- Ain't you worked that out?
- And McFly. Girls like McFly.

31:37.813 --> 31:40.116
She's a naughty, naughty little girl

31:40.707 --> 31:42.762
and I don't like to disappoint.

31:47.831 --> 31:49.812
Someone's left their shit in here.

31:52.392 --> 31:53.397
Nice!

31:53.920 --> 31:55.322
Check this out!

31:55.601 --> 31:58.519
Oh, my God. Cook,
I'm not sure if that's legal.

31:59.421 --> 32:01.244
That's definitely not legal!

32:01.364 --> 32:04.420
Dunno who this Sid guy was but
he's got fucking great taste in gash.

32:04.540 --> 32:06.959
I can't look. Don't make me look.
I have to look.

32:07.802 --> 32:10.306
Holy shit! That's forbidden.
Forbidden, <i>verboten</i>, <i>interdit</i>.

32:10.426 --> 32:11.922
<i>Prohibido</i>, <i>prohibido</i>!

32:14.361 --> 32:15.377
I'm sorry.

32:15.752 --> 32:18.491
- Was I getting locked on, there?
- Locked on, JJ.

32:19.550 --> 32:22.118
I'm all right. I'm fine.
But can I just remind you,

32:22.238 --> 32:24.998
in a casual, non-locked-on way,
that we're late?

32:26.049 --> 32:28.198
We're late, we're late, we're late!

32:29.818 --> 32:31.002
Sorry.
I'm fine.

32:32.894 --> 32:34.709
- We going?
- Hang on.

32:36.888 --> 32:37.802
Shoot me.

32:38.082 --> 32:39.695
The fucking camera. Go on.

32:42.928 --> 32:44.149
Right, action.

32:44.545 --> 32:47.562
- Cook, what the fuck are you doing?
- Action. Do it, man!

32:59.516 --> 33:02.802
I was saving this for lunch
but what the fuck?

33:03.719 --> 33:04.562
Cheers!

33:09.649 --> 33:11.189
What the fuck are you doing?

33:16.414 --> 33:17.494
Fuck me.

33:22.968 --> 33:23.945
Sorted.

33:24.996 --> 33:26.242
You are fucking mental.

33:27.161 --> 33:29.799
Mental is as mental does.
But we're late.

33:30.614 --> 33:31.522
Shall we?

33:34.874 --> 33:35.977
Let's go.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.409
Come on, run!

33:39.433 --> 33:40.534
So, you see,

33:41.221 --> 33:44.457
they don't mean it.
That's what you have to remember.

33:44.577 --> 33:46.290
They're just kids.

33:46.410 --> 33:48.035
Kids! Yes?

33:49.406 --> 33:50.673
I suppose so.

33:51.089 --> 33:52.817
They don't mean it.

33:53.163 --> 33:54.982
Have you ever fallen off a horse?

33:55.930 --> 33:59.911
You have to drink your milk and get
straight back on that horse.

34:00.136 --> 34:02.153
Okay? Back. Yes?

34:02.481 --> 34:03.719
Uggy uggy uggy!

34:03.882 --> 34:04.601
What?

34:04.921 --> 34:05.779
Kids.

34:06.142 --> 34:07.757
Cheeky, immature.

34:08.322 --> 34:10.786
Harmless. They can't hurt you. Okay?

34:11.208 --> 34:13.121
- They can't hurt me.
- Good girl.

34:14.688 --> 34:15.809
Saddle up!

34:35.338 --> 34:38.360
Across firmly and round it off.

34:38.480 --> 34:41.357
Across firmly and round it off.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.740
Smooth the cuticle, push.

35:17.040 --> 35:18.440
Remember to breathe.

35:19.615 --> 35:21.146
Smooth the cuticle.

35:22.073 --> 35:22.909
Push.

35:23.714 --> 35:25.263
Smooth the cuticle.

35:27.751 --> 35:28.620
Push.

35:29.017 --> 35:30.068
I'm sorry...

35:30.188 --> 35:31.969
We're filing. What is it?

35:32.451 --> 35:34.704
Well, blimey this is fascinating.

35:34.824 --> 35:38.090
Mega fun. But the thing is...
I have to get out of here.

35:39.123 --> 35:39.978
Sorry?

35:41.377 --> 35:44.730
I have to go because I've got
three super-duper zits coming on.

35:45.764 --> 35:47.811
They're like... proper seepers.

35:48.166 --> 35:49.647
Oh, my God!

35:50.084 --> 35:50.990
Yes, Go!

35:51.333 --> 35:54.750
For God's sake go! Refresh
and moisturise. Don't waste a second.

35:56.135 --> 35:58.022
Refresh and... I'm on it!

36:01.486 --> 36:03.750
Smooth the cuticle. Push.

36:11.158 --> 36:13.788
Blooming 'eck. It's big out here.

36:31.818 --> 36:32.795
Right.

36:35.265 --> 36:37.218
Now... we've gotta...

36:38.686 --> 36:39.766
Christ.

36:43.487 --> 36:44.473
Fuck it.

36:50.994 --> 36:52.580
Okay. Whatever...

36:53.660 --> 36:56.198
We've gotta... stand up,

36:56.324 --> 36:57.683
say our names

36:58.149 --> 37:00.070
and a unique fact about ourselves.

37:01.573 --> 37:03.413
Right. I'll start.

37:07.054 --> 37:08.121
I'm Kieran

37:08.441 --> 37:11.190
and I hate being
a fucking teacher. You.

37:16.593 --> 37:19.214
I'm JJ and with regard
to mathematic aptitude

37:19.334 --> 37:21.771
I'm in the top 0.3%
of the population

37:22.006 --> 37:24.813
which is an interesting demographic
statistic because paradoxically

37:24.933 --> 37:27.823
my communication,
interpersonal and intuitive skills

37:27.943 --> 37:30.045
- are towards the lower quartiles.
- You've stopped me

37:30.165 --> 37:32.418
in my fucking tracks there,
yeah. You.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.677
I'm Katie.

37:36.959 --> 37:38.909
I've never not had a boyfriend
since I was seven.

37:40.442 --> 37:42.153
Congratulations. You.

37:45.573 --> 37:46.606
I'm Emily.

37:47.941 --> 37:50.430
- I've never had a boyfriend.
- Shit happens. You.

37:53.635 --> 37:54.630
I'm Naomi.

37:54.999 --> 37:56.062
I hate injustice.

37:56.788 --> 37:58.309
People tell lies about me.

37:59.057 --> 38:00.510
You at the back.

38:01.287 --> 38:04.283
- I'm Kumir. I'm gay.
- Yup. Good. You.

38:06.316 --> 38:09.326
I'm Max,
and both my parents are artists.

38:10.039 --> 38:13.552
Great. I'm very very happy for you.
What about you? With the bling.

38:15.662 --> 38:16.884
I'm Effy.

38:17.004 --> 38:18.870
And I think
my mum's having an affair.

38:19.941 --> 38:22.078
Good one. Shows enterprise.

38:22.628 --> 38:24.047
What about you, big man?

38:26.327 --> 38:27.369
I'm Freddie.

38:28.012 --> 38:29.470
I met a girl I like today.

38:30.190 --> 38:31.798
She's like...

38:33.500 --> 38:34.449
beautiful.

38:38.313 --> 38:39.346
That's it.

38:39.642 --> 38:42.870
That's it? That's your unique fact?
That's just great.

38:43.461 --> 38:46.532
Fascinating, Freddie,
thank you for that. What about you?

38:47.270 --> 38:50.293
I'm Katie and
I had Frosties for breakfast.

38:50.782 --> 38:53.430
Frosties, that's product
placement in my opinion.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.830
You there at the back
beside the wee gay man?

38:56.425 --> 38:59.013
My name's Nathan and seven members

38:59.133 --> 39:01.239
of my immediate
family have been on Crimewatch.

39:01.519 --> 39:03.359
Brilliant,
what a year this is gonna be.

39:04.601 --> 39:08.005
I'm feeling rather shit. I think
I need to go to the Nurse's office.

39:08.949 --> 39:10.149
Okay. Go on then.

39:11.007 --> 39:12.537
Right. Where were we?

39:14.210 --> 39:17.270
Oh, stuff it.
Let's just watch a DVD about...

39:18.588 --> 39:19.678
Oh, Christ.

39:20.250 --> 39:24.124
"How To Be Inclusive". Holy Mother of
divine shite, who makes up this shit?

39:24.244 --> 39:27.000
Actually, Kieran,
I'm not feeling too well either.

39:27.977 --> 39:30.200
My balls are aching. I might
have to go and see that nurse.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.979
Right! Bugger off then.

39:32.358 --> 39:35.270
- Cheers, Kieran.
- See if she can laser Jordan off them.

39:39.456 --> 39:41.590
Right, how the fuck does this...

39:49.219 --> 39:51.723
Can I be in this class?
I don't like mine.

39:51.843 --> 39:55.070
Why not? Make up the numbers.
You doing some A levels?

39:55.655 --> 39:57.393
One, please. Philosophy.

39:58.142 --> 39:59.446
Okay, sit down.

39:59.829 --> 40:02.510
When you've worked out the point of
living, come and fucking tell me.

40:03.039 --> 40:04.062
Whizzer!

40:06.563 --> 40:07.630
Where's Effy?

40:15.843 --> 40:17.470
They don't have a nurse.

40:21.055 --> 40:22.558
I just gotta get drugs.

40:23.638 --> 40:24.510
And sex.

41:25.834 --> 41:28.425
Grab my balls! Grab my balls!
