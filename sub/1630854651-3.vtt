WEBVTT

00:15.416 --> 00:19.541
Who in their right mind would
throw away a genuine Spuds MacKenzie?

00:19.625 --> 00:21.208
This thing's a collector's item!

00:21.291 --> 00:23.458
Who was Spuds MacKenzie again?

00:23.541 --> 00:25.500
Spuds was the ultimate party dog.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.791
He could skateboard,
he was in a fraternity,

00:27.875 --> 00:30.541
and he got all the babes.

00:30.625 --> 00:34.916
Wait. Were they implying that this dog
had sex with human women?

00:35.000 --> 00:36.833
Times were different back then, Daniel.

00:36.916 --> 00:38.791
Now grab a hold of this rope.

00:38.875 --> 00:41.375
One, two, three…

00:46.041 --> 00:47.416
Ugh!

00:47.500 --> 00:50.583
Hey, hamstrings!
How about a little help here?

00:50.666 --> 00:51.791
What can I do for you?

00:51.875 --> 00:55.208
Just grab a hold of this rope
and anything else you'd like.

00:55.291 --> 00:58.708
What are you? About 6'2", 211 pounds?

00:58.791 --> 01:01.291
Yeah. That's exactly what I am.
How'd you know?

01:01.875 --> 01:04.000
My aunt's special skill.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.416
Her high school guidance counselor
always said she should go

01:06.500 --> 01:08.500
-into carnival guessing.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.916
Daniel! Run upstairs
and yank this thing inside.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.125
-"Yank."

01:14.208 --> 01:15.875
I stay… here.

01:15.958 --> 01:16.791
Fine.

01:16.875 --> 01:19.708
I think I left some bras drying
in the oven anyway.

01:19.791 --> 01:22.083
So, you… live near here?

01:22.166 --> 01:26.000
Or, you just… walk around
offering to pull people's ropes? Heh.

01:26.083 --> 01:29.375
That sounded very dirty
as it came into my mouth-- Out of.

01:29.458 --> 01:30.375
-Jesus!

01:30.458 --> 01:33.166
I actually  just moved
to that building on the corner.

01:33.250 --> 01:36.916
Wow, that's really close
to where I live, which is… right here.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.916
Oh, cool. Jason.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.375
Oh, right. I'm Danny. El. Danielle.

01:42.458 --> 01:44.458
Is it Danielle or Daniel?

01:44.541 --> 01:45.708
It's just Daniel.

01:45.791 --> 01:47.583
Welcome home, Spuds.

01:48.166 --> 01:51.750
I actually work up the street
at Kreativ Jus.

01:52.291 --> 01:54.041
I get one free juice per quarter

01:54.125 --> 01:56.416
and I'd love to give it to you
as a thank you.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.916
And I'd like to take it from you
as a "you're welcome."

02:00.000 --> 02:02.875
Damn it! I already have this one.

02:02.958 --> 02:04.708
I knew it looked familiar.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.791
Heads up!

02:05.875 --> 02:06.875
-Shoot!

02:06.958 --> 02:07.791
Ah.

02:07.875 --> 02:09.541
Now it's the city's problem.

02:19.833 --> 02:21.958
Kurt, are you sure about this haircut?

02:22.041 --> 02:24.583
It's real short. I can see your rage vein.

02:25.125 --> 02:30.208
Ah, it's new regulations by my prick
of a supervisor, Director Worsley.

02:30.291 --> 02:31.791
He's been on my ass ever since

02:31.875 --> 02:36.375
I accidentally let one full-size bottle
of Pert Plus get through security.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.500
And then, bam, he freaking demotes me!

02:38.583 --> 02:40.583
Oh, no, Lost and Found?

02:40.666 --> 02:42.166
Pfft, I wish.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.708
Terminal Four. That's Spirit Airlines.

02:44.791 --> 02:47.833
People go through security
with live chickens over there.

02:47.916 --> 02:50.791
All right, Heidi's waitin' for me.
I gotta run.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.958
Oh, you and bird lady
got any big weekend plans?

02:54.041 --> 02:56.708
Gonna chew up some food
and spit it into her mouth?

02:56.791 --> 02:59.625
No, I'm actually meeting her parents
this weekend.

02:59.708 --> 03:02.791
They're cat people, though,
so things might get a little tense.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.666
Anyway, thanks, Di. Top cut as usual.

03:09.041 --> 03:09.916
Aah.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.208
Good for Kurt.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.375
You need to stop cutting
your ex-husband's hair.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.708
It's the one thing we still have.

03:15.791 --> 03:17.208
What about son?

03:17.291 --> 03:20.541
Mikey? Oh, yeah, Mikey and the haircut.

03:20.625 --> 03:22.208
That's all we have left.

03:22.291 --> 03:24.750
Diane, he's clearly moved on.

03:24.833 --> 03:26.083
You should too.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.250
I'm fine.

03:27.333 --> 03:30.875
I mean, I will be
once my Hitachi's back from the shop.

03:30.958 --> 03:33.125
-Your TV?
-No, my vibrator.

03:33.208 --> 03:35.208
-Motor burnt out.

03:35.291 --> 03:39.000
Stewart, I am so sorry
you had to hear that.

03:39.083 --> 03:41.375
Oh, it's fine. Diane's a riot.

03:42.250 --> 03:46.000
By the way, your ex's girlfriend
has some big shoes to fill.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.375
That depends on how much salt
I've had that day.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.208
I fluctuate between a six and a ten.

03:51.375 --> 03:52.208
Nice.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.208
Diane, you've been
out of the game so long,

03:57.291 --> 03:59.666
you couldn't even tell Stewart
was flirting with you.

03:59.750 --> 04:00.583
He was?

04:00.666 --> 04:02.666
People are too subtle now!

04:02.750 --> 04:06.875
Back in the day, guys would just say,
"That's a lot of hair spray. Wanna bang?"

04:06.958 --> 04:09.166
What's Diane struggling with now?

04:09.250 --> 04:11.041
Moderation? Decorum?

04:11.125 --> 04:12.833
How to properly flush a toilet?

04:14.708 --> 04:16.416
We're trying to get her a man, Gideon.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.833
I don't need a man.

04:17.916 --> 04:20.083
I have a very fulfilling life.

04:20.166 --> 04:23.000
Oh, really? What did you do last night?

04:23.083 --> 04:25.958
I found a beer sign in an alley,
dragged it 14 blocks,

04:26.041 --> 04:27.708
then fell asleep in my Lay-Z-Boy

04:27.791 --> 04:30.416
with a family-sized mostaccioli in my lap.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.666
Okay. Maybe I should go on a date.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.333
I mean, he's so good-looking

04:38.416 --> 04:41.083
and it <i>seemed</i> like there was a vibe,

04:41.166 --> 04:42.833
but I don't know if he's even gay.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.250
If I met him,
I could tell you in a second.

04:45.333 --> 04:49.208
I can immediately detect people's
sexual orientation and astrological sign.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.250
Oh my God, that's him!

04:53.333 --> 04:57.333
Jason! Hi. Hello. Welcome.

04:57.416 --> 04:58.666
Whatever.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.250
How is it going?

05:00.333 --> 05:01.291
Hey, Daniel.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.291
-Thought I'd claim my free juice.

05:03.375 --> 05:05.750
Well, I've got some juice for you.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.041
Libra and I'm not sure.

05:08.125 --> 05:13.000
Okay. I'll have a large… Mean Green?

05:13.083 --> 05:14.166
Is that good?

05:14.250 --> 05:16.333
Honestly, they're all horrible.

05:16.416 --> 05:19.125
-Thanks again for your help the other day.

05:19.208 --> 05:22.541
You must work out. Like, a lot.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.666
I'm actually
headed to my gym now.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.625
Chicago Power Clean. You know it?

05:26.708 --> 05:28.000
Do I know it?

05:28.083 --> 05:31.833
Um, it's only my favorite gymnasium. Gym.

05:31.916 --> 05:32.875
Here you go.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.541
Thanks. Uh, maybe
I'll see you there sometime.

05:35.625 --> 05:36.458
Totally.

05:36.541 --> 05:37.625
Totally.

05:40.666 --> 05:44.083
Oh my God! This is the loser patrol.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.500
Look at this dork.

05:45.583 --> 05:50.208
"I love to travel,
eat healthy and exercise."

05:50.291 --> 05:51.666
No, thanks, narc.

05:51.750 --> 05:55.458
You can't keep calling every guy
without a tattoo a narc.

05:55.541 --> 05:59.916
Here. Kent.
He's an ear, nose, and throat doctor.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.583
More like jeer, blows, and goat doctor.

06:03.666 --> 06:06.166
Goat doctor? You should be so lucky.

06:06.250 --> 06:07.916
All these men are dweebs.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.333
I like a guy who gets most of his clothes
from car shows.

06:11.416 --> 06:14.250
A man who's not afraid
to order his steak raw!

06:14.333 --> 06:15.541
Or his chicken.

06:15.625 --> 06:19.708
Look, because I want to wrap this up,
I think I may just have a solution.

06:19.791 --> 06:23.333
I downloaded this app for myself
and was <i>very</i> disappointed,

06:23.416 --> 06:25.750
so I'm guessing you're gonna love it.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.416
"Mustaches Only dot com"?

06:29.291 --> 06:31.750
Holy shit, these guys are all tens!

06:32.250 --> 06:33.791
They all look exactly same.

06:33.875 --> 06:35.250
Yeah, not good.

06:35.333 --> 06:38.833
Here.
Oh, this guy's a total gusher.

06:38.916 --> 06:40.291
Make it happen, Gideon.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.375
Only if you agree to do one thing.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.291
Anything.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.500
Your goddamn job!

06:49.208 --> 06:50.250
Oh!

07:01.250 --> 07:03.166
-Daniel?
-Oh, hey, Jason.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.500
I thought that was you.

07:04.583 --> 07:05.583
So, what's up?

07:05.666 --> 07:08.958
Oh, you know,
just throwing some weight around.

07:09.041 --> 07:11.916
Dude, I was just giving you a tour
and you disappeared.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.250
Also, did you just throw a kettlebell?

07:14.333 --> 07:16.291
What? No.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.666
I'll pay for it.
Just give me a second, please.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.708
What a weirdo.

07:22.791 --> 07:24.791
Anyway, so what are you up to?

07:24.875 --> 07:27.666
Uh, well, it's leg day. You want in?

07:27.750 --> 07:29.333
You know what they say about leg day.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.875
Of course, it goes without saying.

07:34.916 --> 07:35.958
Fist pump!

07:36.458 --> 07:37.541
Just one?

07:37.625 --> 07:40.500
Yeah, don't want to get too bulky, so…

07:40.583 --> 07:42.375
You do have a nice lean frame.

07:42.458 --> 07:43.541
Really? You think?

07:43.625 --> 07:45.625
Hey, man, it's time for you to go.

07:45.708 --> 07:49.375
Okay, Devlin. I'll see you soon.

07:49.875 --> 07:51.250
I hope so.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.083
Another loaded baked potato?

07:57.166 --> 07:59.750
No, I know when I've been stood up.

08:00.708 --> 08:03.125
Where do you think you're going,
hot stuff?

08:03.208 --> 08:05.750
You must be Burch. You're late.

08:05.833 --> 08:09.250
Listen, gorgeous,
I'm gonna make you a promise right now.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.583
That will probably never happen again.

08:11.666 --> 08:13.833
You're a goddamn smokeshow,

08:13.916 --> 08:15.875
and I'd like to do nothing more

08:15.958 --> 08:18.666
than to sit here and watch you
eat a bone-in rib eye

08:18.750 --> 08:20.750
while, if you permit me,

08:20.833 --> 08:22.750
I run my hand up your leg.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.625
You're lucky I've only been
eating side dishes.

08:32.833 --> 08:33.750
Hmm.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.250
Damn it.

08:38.458 --> 08:39.875
If you're from the liquor store,

08:39.958 --> 08:42.125
just leave my aunt's Goldschläger
at the door!

08:42.208 --> 08:44.125
-Come on!

08:47.708 --> 08:50.375
Oh my God, Jason.
What are you doing here?

08:50.458 --> 08:51.666
Could I come in for a second?

08:51.750 --> 08:53.083
Yeah, for sure.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.208
Can I get you something to drink?

08:56.291 --> 09:00.125
We have, um… half a Clamato?

09:00.208 --> 09:01.375
I'm good.

09:01.458 --> 09:05.166
Daniel, is there any way that maybe
you came to the gym just to…

09:05.250 --> 09:06.916
I don't know, flirt with me?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.125
What? No.

09:09.208 --> 09:10.333
Yeah, right.

09:10.416 --> 09:13.208
You're not even gay, right?
You're not gay. Are you gay?

09:14.250 --> 09:16.375
Uh, all my ex-boyfriends seem to think so.

09:16.458 --> 09:19.541
And I had a girlfriend in junior high
who was very suspicious.

09:19.625 --> 09:20.916
Oh, so you are gay.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.666
Yes, <i>and</i> I'd like to cook you dinner
at my place on Friday night.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.750
That sounds really nice.

09:26.833 --> 09:27.666
Awesome.

09:27.750 --> 09:31.166
Uh, I'm done with work at 5:00
and I work right there, so…

09:31.250 --> 09:32.791
Oh, you work at Wrigley?

09:32.875 --> 09:34.750
Like in marketing or concessions?

09:34.833 --> 09:35.958
I'm the new shortstop.

09:36.041 --> 09:39.708
Wow, a shortstop is… a player?

09:40.916 --> 09:42.541
Mm. Mm.

09:42.625 --> 09:43.791
Aah!

09:43.875 --> 09:46.666
You should charge people to watch you eat.

09:46.750 --> 09:47.708
Another slice?

09:47.791 --> 09:49.666
No, three's my limit.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.416
What do you say we get out of here?

09:51.500 --> 09:53.958
You ever watch the fireworks at Navy Pier?

09:54.041 --> 09:56.333
Um, only 500 times.

09:56.833 --> 09:59.458
Not from my penthouse apartment,
you haven't.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.916
-Yes!

10:05.041 --> 10:07.833
-Yep!
-That was one for the books.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.166
-Pall Mall?
-Virginia Slim 100 Menthol Light?

10:13.750 --> 10:16.458
That's funny. That's funny.

10:16.541 --> 10:19.875
I gotta say, it's been years
since I slept with a guy

10:19.958 --> 10:22.041
whose last name I didn't even know.

10:22.125 --> 10:25.000
It was KC from the Sunshine Band, FYI.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.250
Well, mine's Worsley.

10:27.333 --> 10:30.291
Worsley. That sounds so familiar.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.458
Where do you work?

10:31.541 --> 10:33.625
I'm the head of TSA at Midway.

10:33.708 --> 10:36.333
I'm basically the frickin' mayor
over there.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.333
-Oh, shit.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.375
This guy's such a catch.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.291
But if I tell Kurt I'm dating his boss,

10:43.375 --> 10:46.041
he will certainly
have his sixth heart attack.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.875
Six? What is wrong with you people?

10:48.958 --> 10:50.291
Give up pork!

10:50.375 --> 10:52.958
Come on, guys. I'm really tormented here.

10:53.041 --> 10:54.083
What do I do?

10:54.166 --> 10:55.333
Listen, Diane.

10:55.416 --> 10:58.791
Kurt sat here and told you how serious
he's getting with his girlfriend.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.458
If you like this guy,
you should explore that.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.625
Huh. That makes sense.

11:03.708 --> 11:06.041
When first husband die of turkey plague,

11:06.125 --> 11:08.541
I marry his boss at turkey farm.

11:08.625 --> 11:11.666
Good point, Zuzs.
I'm just gonna be honest with Kurt.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.958
He's a grown adult. He'll be fine.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.083
How could you do this to me?!

11:16.166 --> 11:19.000
Kurt, relax,
it's not the end of the world.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.500
No, it's worse!

11:20.583 --> 11:23.125
Ah, this is the ultimate betrayal!

11:23.208 --> 11:24.916
I forbid you to date him!

11:25.000 --> 11:26.875
You can't forbid me to do shit!

11:26.958 --> 11:30.000
I'm a grown-ass woman
with the body of a 19-year-old.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.708
I can do whatever I want

11:31.791 --> 11:34.583
and I'm going to
date the fuck out of this guy!

11:35.333 --> 11:36.541
Hi, sweetie.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.791
Aah!

12:19.208 --> 12:22.083
Mm! Yummers, this is… good.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.625
So is your acting.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.000
Don't beat yourself up.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.208
Sometimes my aunt
cooks meals on the radiator.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.875
Should we go out to grab a bite?

12:31.958 --> 12:36.666
Or we could just order a pizza
and… hook up while we wait.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.208
Ow!

12:43.291 --> 12:45.500
Not so close there, big red.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.916
-Go ahead and trim that ear fuzz too.
-Mm.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.750
You heard the man, Zuzs.

12:49.833 --> 12:52.666
My Burchie likes his ears
like a baby's ass.

12:54.791 --> 12:56.666
And here's your tip.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.416
What is this?

12:58.500 --> 12:59.875
It's a scratcher.

12:59.958 --> 13:01.458
You could win up to 500 bucks.

13:02.041 --> 13:03.416
It's better than cash.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.000
So, give me a smile, huh?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.666
Oh, these are the best!

13:06.750 --> 13:09.666
All you gotta do
is get four stacks of cash in a row,

13:10.541 --> 13:11.666
which you didn't get.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.291
Ow. Better luck next time, honey.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.500
And I'll see you tonight, toots.

13:17.625 --> 13:20.250
-Isn't he a hunk?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.125
He is hunk of something.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.333
Hey! Lose the 'tude, Zuzs!

13:28.166 --> 13:31.416
Ah, I feel like our bodies
are fully imprinted on this couch.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.416
Maybe we should
go for a walk or something.

13:33.500 --> 13:36.208
But if we're walking,
I can't be the big spoon.

13:36.291 --> 13:37.500
Holy shit!

13:37.583 --> 13:39.666
There's a Robyn concert
at Wrigley next week.

13:39.750 --> 13:40.958
We gotta go!

13:41.041 --> 13:42.875
Yeah… I don't know.

13:42.958 --> 13:46.833
Uh, we had, like, a two-hour
Robyn dance party in here the other night.

13:47.416 --> 13:49.458
I don't really like big stadiums.

13:49.541 --> 13:51.416
You're a baseball player!

13:51.500 --> 13:53.625
Yeah, it's… different. Okay?

13:53.708 --> 13:56.083
So, come on.
Let's just watch some Netflix.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.458
There's a new show <i>Love is Quiet,</i>

13:57.541 --> 13:59.791
where people go on dates,
but they aren't allowed to speak.

14:00.791 --> 14:02.875
<i>Welcome to</i> Love is Quiet.

14:02.958 --> 14:07.291
<i>Today, lovebirds Alex and Brittany</i>
<i>are at the Riverside Community Library.</i>

14:07.375 --> 14:08.666
<i>Shh!</i>

14:09.541 --> 14:13.083
Friday night, they're unveiling
a new art project in Terminal 2.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.583
A bunch of kids
painting their own hands or something.

14:15.666 --> 14:19.250
They asked me to give a little speech
and I'd love for you to be there with me.

14:19.333 --> 14:22.583
I wouldn't miss it for all the iced teas
in Long Island.

14:22.666 --> 14:25.583
Diane, do me a favor.
Go pick out a Beanie Boo or something.

14:25.666 --> 14:29.041
Oh, I wonder if they still have
the Mayor Daley one.

14:29.125 --> 14:32.083
Why do I have to keep coming in here, huh?
Get it right.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.333
Mr. Worsley, I--

14:33.416 --> 14:35.875
-This is your last warning.
-I'm trying my best.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.916
Hey, remember what I said.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.625
All right, all right, all right.

14:39.708 --> 14:40.541
Let's go.

14:40.625 --> 14:42.541
Everything okay over there?

14:42.625 --> 14:44.541
Yeah, that guy's a troublemaker.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.791
Here. These are for you.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.958
<i>I know some women who,</i>

14:49.041 --> 14:51.541
<i>if their boyfriend gave them</i>
<i>a bag of peanut M&Ms</i>

14:51.625 --> 14:53.458
<i>he just bopped someone on the head with,</i>

14:53.541 --> 14:54.625
<i>would freak out.</i>

14:54.708 --> 14:58.083
<i>But I gotta be honest. It turned me on.</i>

14:58.625 --> 14:59.791
<i>And I was hungry.</i>

15:02.541 --> 15:06.125
So, Jason, Cubs fans
are thrilled to have you in Chicago.

15:06.208 --> 15:08.750
First question. Thin crust or deep dish?

15:08.833 --> 15:10.833
Oh, I gotta go thin crust.

15:10.916 --> 15:12.000
Cut! Ugh!

15:12.083 --> 15:13.916
You gotta say "deep dish," man.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.375
Hey, I want to meet the new rookie.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.666
Oh, hey, buddy. How's it going?

15:18.750 --> 15:21.208
I'm good… buddy.

15:21.291 --> 15:22.291
How are you?

15:22.375 --> 15:24.250
I'll catch up with you later. Okay?

15:24.333 --> 15:25.708
Um, yeah, okay.

15:25.791 --> 15:26.666
Cool.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.958
Okay. Let's go again.
Remember, "deep dish."

15:29.041 --> 15:29.875
Sure, right.

15:29.958 --> 15:32.625
And can we fly in
some powder? He's shiny.

15:33.875 --> 15:37.666
They say to take a dump right after sex,
so you don't get a UTI.

15:37.750 --> 15:38.958
Don't you mean pee?

15:39.041 --> 15:41.166
I do both just to be safe.

15:41.791 --> 15:43.250
-Ow!

15:44.041 --> 15:45.916
Holy shit!

15:47.958 --> 15:50.125
Looks like you got a little lost.

15:50.208 --> 15:52.708
Burch! What are these scratchers?

15:52.791 --> 15:54.416
It's a little side project.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.166
I get the overseas shipments

15:56.250 --> 15:58.875
and then I sell them to stores
at a discount.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.000
Well, don't just stand there,
grab me a nickel!

16:02.083 --> 16:03.500
Let's get scratchin'!

16:03.583 --> 16:06.416
No, Diane. None of these are winners.

16:06.500 --> 16:07.666
That's the whole thing.

16:08.250 --> 16:09.625
Really? Oh.

16:09.708 --> 16:11.208
I… I don't know, Burch.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.583
I'm trying not to get
involved with any more scams

16:13.666 --> 16:16.041
ever since those Amway psychos
blew up my car.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.833
Relax, it's a victimless crime.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.500
Burch. This feels kind of shady.

16:21.583 --> 16:25.333
I was saving this for later,
but, uh… what the hell.

16:26.833 --> 16:30.708
Diane, I want you to be my lady 24/7.

16:30.791 --> 16:32.291
Move in with me.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.916
The Forever Bears
Diamond Infinity pendant.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.250
You went to Jared.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.208
I did.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.333
Jared Bagowski.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.375
The unofficial jeweler
of the Chicago Bears.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.166
So, what do you say, Diane?

16:45.250 --> 16:48.875
Yes! Yes! A thousand times yes!

16:49.833 --> 16:53.416
Bet you didn't know you could
sub your eggs for another ham steak.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.791
So, when do you think
you're gonna be moving in?

16:55.875 --> 16:57.750
Well, here's the thing, Burch.

16:57.833 --> 17:00.250
I'm a little worried
about my nephew Daniel.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.208
I don't know if I can just leave him.

17:02.291 --> 17:03.458
Pfft. Screw him.

17:03.541 --> 17:04.875
Excuse me?

17:04.958 --> 17:06.416
I-I didn't mean it like that.

17:06.500 --> 17:10.791
I'm just saying, you'll be happier in life
when you stop worrying about other people.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.791
And he's like a kid, he'll be fine.

17:12.875 --> 17:15.083
You gotta look out for number one.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.583
You deserve it.

17:16.666 --> 17:17.916
Okay, anything else?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.416
No, thanks, toots.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.333
<i>This</i> is for you.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.833
Oh, wow. A scratcher ticket?

17:23.916 --> 17:25.666
Maybe I can pay my rent this month.

17:26.625 --> 17:29.208
Anyhoo, I know you got work.

17:29.291 --> 17:30.666
I'm gonna go say hi to Mikey.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.000
Who the fuck's Mikey?!

17:32.083 --> 17:34.208
Relax! He's my son, remember?

17:34.291 --> 17:35.791
Oh, right. Okay.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.708
I'll see you at the art thing tonight.

17:37.791 --> 17:38.791
And look hot.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.250
There's my boy.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.333
Ma!

17:48.416 --> 17:51.875
Hey, Mikey! How's your dad doing?

17:51.958 --> 17:53.208
Ah, not good.

17:53.291 --> 17:55.791
He scream-cried himself
to sleep last night.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.291
Well, that might be
because I've been seeing his boss.

17:59.375 --> 18:02.541
Yeah, that's specifically
what he was screaming about.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.583
And how do you feel about that?

18:05.666 --> 18:10.041
Well, you know, I love you
and I just want you to be with a good guy.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.833
<i>Hey, numb nuts.</i>
<i>This is Director Worsley.</i>

18:12.916 --> 18:14.750
Hey, speak of the devil.

18:14.833 --> 18:15.875
-Yes, sir.

18:15.958 --> 18:17.125
<i>Listen, you dope.</i>

18:17.208 --> 18:19.125
<i>Were you handling a shipment</i>
<i>from Chechnya?</i>

18:19.208 --> 18:22.625
Yes, sir, uh, about 20 minutes ago.
I put it in Hangar 6.

18:22.708 --> 18:25.125
<i>They were supposed</i>
<i>to go directly to my office!</i>

18:25.208 --> 18:26.125
<i>Wake up, dumbass!</i>

18:26.208 --> 18:28.375
Uh, sorry about that, sir.

18:28.458 --> 18:29.916
Hey, do you want to say hi?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.625
I'll talk to him later. Love you.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.958
<i>Well, fix it, you shit-for-brains!</i>

18:39.416 --> 18:40.750
I need to talk to you.

18:40.833 --> 18:42.375
What the hell was that yesterday?

18:42.458 --> 18:44.041
You totally blew me off.

18:44.125 --> 18:47.666
I'm sorry, but I-I was busy
and that reporter was really grilling me.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.541
Jason, are you in the closet?

18:50.625 --> 18:52.541
What? No. I've been out for years.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.000
I just don't want the stress
of a public relationship.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.708
I want my baseball
to be the thing people talk about,

18:57.791 --> 18:59.000
not who I'm dating.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.916
Well, <i>I</i> want someone
who I can hold hands with,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.541
not just inside his apartment
while watching <i>Bridgerton,</i>

19:04.625 --> 19:07.750
but outside at, like, a <i>Bridgerton</i>
viewing party or something.

19:07.833 --> 19:09.166
Daniel--

19:09.250 --> 19:11.458
This is what ended my last relationship.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.833
All the attention.

19:12.916 --> 19:15.500
And that was in the minor leagues.
I'm a Chicago Cub now.

19:15.583 --> 19:18.500
I'm sorry, I just--
I want to keep things the way they are.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.958
Well I don't want to be
somebody's dirty little secret!

19:21.041 --> 19:22.291
Okay, fine!

19:22.375 --> 19:23.875
I'm sorry you can't handle this.

19:23.958 --> 19:26.750
I can handle it fine.
You're the one with the problem!

19:26.833 --> 19:27.833
Goodbye.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.625
We're going in the same direction,
aren't we?

19:31.708 --> 19:33.875
Can I go first? I'm late for practice.

19:33.958 --> 19:34.958
Fine!

19:36.166 --> 19:38.708
-I told you I have two fake knees.

19:38.791 --> 19:42.416
Ma'am, that may be true, but I still
gotta wand you for weapons.

19:42.916 --> 19:45.208
-Ah! Fucking chickens!
-Kurt.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.083
Oh. What are you doing here?

19:47.166 --> 19:49.166
-You gonna tell me you're getting hitched?

19:49.250 --> 19:52.833
No, but Burch did ask me to move in.

19:52.916 --> 19:54.708
Oh, God. No!

19:54.791 --> 19:56.791
Ah, I'm gonna toss my cookies!

19:59.375 --> 20:02.166
You weren't lying. Those are all cookies.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.625
You did this to me, Diane!

20:03.708 --> 20:05.666
-Kurt, listen!

20:05.750 --> 20:06.916
I need your help.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.708
Even though she looks like a zebra,
trust me, this one's all cougar.

20:16.458 --> 20:18.416
He said in the car he liked it.

20:18.500 --> 20:19.333
Hey, sweetie.

20:19.416 --> 20:21.750
Be a doll and go grab me
another Jack and Coke.

20:21.833 --> 20:23.666
-Easy on the Coke.

20:24.833 --> 20:25.708
Diane!

20:26.333 --> 20:28.375
Stewart! What are you doing here?

20:28.458 --> 20:32.166
I do a lot of work with Hands Make Plans.
They're a great organization.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.833
Those are on me.

20:34.541 --> 20:35.541
Thanks for these.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.458
My pleasure.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.458
Your dress is really pretty, by the way.

20:56.041 --> 20:58.875
Daniel! Daniel!

21:02.291 --> 21:03.916
Sorry, I didn't mean to break it!

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
What the hell are you doing?
I thought you were afraid of heights.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.166
I'm terrified!

21:08.250 --> 21:10.041
Here, I brought you something.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.041
Robyn at Wrigley Field.

21:13.791 --> 21:17.875
Daniel, I don't want to throw away
what we have because of my baggage.

21:17.958 --> 21:20.541
I like you and I don't care who knows.

21:20.625 --> 21:22.500
Hey, everybody! Up here!

21:22.583 --> 21:25.416
I am into this guy, and I fucked up

21:25.500 --> 21:27.458
and I'm really hoping
he'll give me another chance.

21:27.541 --> 21:28.666
Give him another chance!

21:28.750 --> 21:30.291
Where's the Taco Bell?

21:30.375 --> 21:31.500
They tore it down.

21:31.583 --> 21:33.666
So, what do you say, Daniel?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.208
Well, I don't know.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.000
Please answer so I can get down.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.250
Yes. Yes, yes!

21:39.333 --> 21:40.666
-Yes!
-Whoa!

21:46.458 --> 21:48.041
Spuds broke my fall.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.833
Thank you… Spuds.

21:50.916 --> 21:54.791
So, every time one of these brave children
paints their own hand,

21:54.875 --> 21:57.166
they get one step closer to…

21:57.875 --> 21:59.000
their plans.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.000
I guess.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.708
Anyway, here to welcome us to Terminal 2,

22:02.791 --> 22:05.708
the Mayor of Midway, Burch Worsley.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.208
Hey, what are you doing?

22:09.291 --> 22:10.916
I'll just be a sec, sweetie.

22:11.416 --> 22:12.833
Sorry, Mr. Lieutenant Governor,

22:12.916 --> 22:16.875
but I'd like to say a few words
real quick about Burch Worsley.

22:18.375 --> 22:22.458
We've only been datin' for a few weeks,
but he has swept me off my feet.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.708
Don't even get me started
about how he is in the sack.

22:25.791 --> 22:26.625
Beast!

22:26.708 --> 22:27.833
-Uh!

22:27.916 --> 22:30.125
And he is so generous.

22:30.208 --> 22:33.208
He always tips everyone
with these lotto scratchers.

22:33.291 --> 22:35.291
I love watching him make people's day

22:35.375 --> 22:37.666
by giving them a chance
to be a big winner.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.583
But then I realized something.

22:39.666 --> 22:42.916
Burch Worsley
is just like these scratchers.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.708
A total fraud.

22:44.791 --> 22:46.791
-Okay, toots. That's enough.

22:46.875 --> 22:49.916
I said, "A total fraud!"

22:50.000 --> 22:52.250
Jesus Christ, Kurt, that's your cue!

22:52.333 --> 22:53.250
Oh!

22:53.833 --> 22:55.333
-Ugh, goddammit!

22:55.416 --> 22:58.750
Go ahead and scratch them.
Not a winner in the house!

22:59.583 --> 23:04.291
Burch Worsley, you are under arrest
for the forging of state lotto tickets.

23:04.375 --> 23:06.541
You're not allowed to say that.

23:06.625 --> 23:10.958
Burch Worsley, you're under arrest
for the forging of state lotto tickets.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.458
Where the hell'd you get those?

23:12.541 --> 23:14.291
-Hangar 5.
-Hangar 6.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.875
Hangar 6.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.000
Asshole.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.541
You did me dirty, Diane.

23:19.625 --> 23:22.416
We did each other dirty, Burch.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.083
Thanks for the help, Di.

23:24.166 --> 23:27.041
A bust this big will for sure
get me off chicken duty.

23:27.125 --> 23:30.541
All I heard was "bust this big"
and "get me off."

23:37.000 --> 23:40.416
Not so fast, bow tie. Keep it pouring.

23:40.916 --> 23:43.208
Sorry things didn't work out
between you and Burch.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.583
Ah, it's okay.

23:44.666 --> 23:47.041
There's plenty of other steers
on the prairie.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.416
Well, if you want to give
a nice guy a shot,

23:49.500 --> 23:50.541
you know where to find me.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.708
Huh.
