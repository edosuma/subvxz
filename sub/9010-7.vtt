00:07.542 --> 00:08.500
WELL, CRUSHER,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.042
ALL YOUR GENETIC MUTATIONS

00:10.083 --> 00:11.834
SEEM TO BE IN PROPER

00:10.083 --> 00:11.834
DISORDER.

00:11.876 --> 00:13.918
THERE IS ONE THING--

00:13.959 --> 00:16.042
SINCE YOU'RE THE STRONGEST

00:13.959 --> 00:16.042
MAN IN THE UNIVERSE,

00:16.082 --> 00:18.000
CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THIS?

00:19.083 --> 00:22.876
THESE PACKAGES

00:19.083 --> 00:22.876
ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.042
I COULD'VE DONE  THAT.</font>

00:32.500 --> 00:34.500
OH, HEY, SKYLAR.

00:36.083 --> 00:38.042
I CAN'T WAIT FOR MY

00:36.083 --> 00:38.042
FIRST </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> DAY OF SCHOOL TOMORROW.</font>

00:38.083 --> 00:40.334
I JUST HOPE IT'S BETTER

00:38.083 --> 00:40.334
THAN SCHOOL ON  MY </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> PLANET.</font>

00:40.375 --> 00:42.876
IF YOU'RE LATE, THE TEACHER

00:40.375 --> 00:42.876
MAKES YOU STAND IN THE CORNER.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.459
THAT DOESN'T SOUND SO BAD.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.459
( grunts )

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
"CORNER" IS OUR WORD

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
FOR "OVEN."

00:48.083 --> 00:49.876
YOU'LL DO  FINE.</font>

00:49.918 --> 00:51.209
OH--AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:51.250 --> 00:53.000
YOU SHOULD

00:51.250 --> 00:53.000
JOIN THE CHEERLEADERS

00:53.042 --> 00:55.042
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL BENDY,

00:53.042 --> 00:55.042
AND FLIPPY,

00:55.083 --> 00:57.209
AND CAN INVITE US

00:55.083 --> 00:57.209
TO THEIR PARTIES.

00:59.083 --> 01:00.125
COULD YOU EXCUSE US?

01:01.626 --> 01:04.250
DUDE, I DON'T WANT SKYLAR

01:01.626 --> 01:04.250
TO JOIN THE CHEERLEADERS.

01:04.292 --> 01:06.000
SHE'LL START

01:04.292 --> 01:06.000
HANGING OUT WITH JOCKS

01:06.042 --> 01:08.083
WHOSE MUSCLES ARE BIGGER

01:06.042 --> 01:08.083
THAN MY FACE!

01:08.125 --> 01:09.918
HOW CAN I COMPETE WITH THAT?

01:09.959 --> 01:11.876
I DON'T KNOW.

01:09.959 --> 01:11.876
GET A BIGGER FACE?

01:14.250 --> 01:16.042
SKYLAR, IF I WERE YOU,

01:16.083 --> 01:17.500
I'D STAY AWAY

01:16.083 --> 01:17.500
FROM THE CHEERLEADERS.

01:17.542 --> 01:21.042
I MEAN, "TWO, FOUR, SIX,

01:17.542 --> 01:21.042
EIGHT--WHO DO WE APPRECIATE?"

01:21.083 --> 01:22.876
CLEARLY NOT ODD NUMBERS.

01:27.042 --> 01:28.000
WHO'S THAT?

01:28.042 --> 01:29.209
AH, IT'S HORACE'S COUSIN,

01:29.250 --> 01:30.459
BORIS DIAZ.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.417
ALSO KNOWN AS TIMELINE.

01:33.459 --> 01:34.584
HE'S A SUPERHERO

01:34.626 --> 01:36.167
WHOSE ABILITY

01:34.626 --> 01:36.167
TO SEE IN THE FUTURE

01:36.209 --> 01:37.959
HELPS OTHER HEROES

01:36.209 --> 01:37.959
FIGHT EVIL.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.626
ALSO, HE'S WON EVERY

01:38.000 --> 01:39.626
FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE

01:39.667 --> 01:40.918
HE'S EVER BEEN IN.

01:41.709 --> 01:43.626
OH. I'M GONNA

01:41.709 --> 01:43.626
GO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.042
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

01:43.667 --> 01:46.042
HE'S ALREADY

01:43.667 --> 01:46.042
SEEN THIS CONVERSATION

01:46.083 --> 01:47.042
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.042
SO HE ALREADY KNOWS

01:47.083 --> 01:49.042
ALL OF OUR NAMES.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.167
HELLO, LUIGI,

01:51.209 --> 01:53.375
PAUL, CINNAMON.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.292
THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

01:56.083 --> 01:58.292
WITH HIS POWERS.

01:58.334 --> 02:00.292
NO. WE HAVEN'T

01:58.334 --> 02:00.292
EXAMINED HIM YET.

02:00.334 --> 02:02.250
DON'T JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS,

02:00.334 --> 02:02.250
KAZ.

02:02.292 --> 02:04.125
I SEE DANGER.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.000
STEP FORWARD, LUIGI!

02:07.209 --> 02:09.042
YOU ARE SAFE NOW.

02:09.083 --> 02:10.125

WITH YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS?

03:12.667 --> 03:13.918
A FEW WEEKS.

03:13.959 --> 03:17.209
BUT I WAITED TO COME IN UNTIL

03:13.959 --> 03:17.209
MY COUSIN HORACE'S DAY OFF.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.626
WE DON'T GET ALONG.

03:18.667 --> 03:19.584
OH, WHY NOT?

03:19.626 --> 03:21.667
TYPICAL FAMILY STUFF.

03:21.709 --> 03:23.709
HE LOVES BRIDGES.

03:21.709 --> 03:23.709
I HATE BRIDGES.

03:23.751 --> 03:25.000
ENOUGH SAID!

03:25.792 --> 03:27.250
I JUST THOUGHT OF SOMETHING.

03:27.292 --> 03:29.125
WHEN THE VILLAIN SWITCHBLADE

03:27.292 --> 03:29.125
STRANDED TIMELINE

03:29.167 --> 03:30.417
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT,

03:30.459 --> 03:32.042
HIS POWER STOPPED WORKING.

03:32.083 --> 03:34.709
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE

03:32.083 --> 03:34.709
STRANDED IN THE DESERT?

03:34.751 --> 03:37.083
OKAY, WELL FIRST,

03:34.751 --> 03:37.083
YOU HIDE BEHIND A CACTUS

03:37.125 --> 03:38.167
LIKE THIS.

03:38.209 --> 03:40.667
RIGHT? AND THEN YOU

03:38.209 --> 03:40.667
GET SO HUNGRY

03:40.709 --> 03:42.375
THAT YOU THINK A TORTOISE

03:42.417 --> 03:45.000
IS A SLOWLY MOVING HAMBURGER.

03:46.083 --> 03:49.042
OR, IF YOU'RE NOT A CARTOON...

03:49.083 --> 03:52.083
YOU SWEAT A LOT,

03:49.083 --> 03:52.083
CAUSING YOU TO LOSE

03:49.083 --> 03:52.083
ELECTROLYTES.

( machine buzzing )

03:56.584 --> 03:58.125
( rapid beeping )

03:58.167 --> 04:00.834
I WAS RIGHT!

03:58.167 --> 04:00.834
H-HIS SODIUM LEVELS

04:00.876 --> 04:02.042
ARE  WAY </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> BELOW NORMAL.</font>

04:02.083 --> 04:04.667
NURSE, START A 20-MILLILITER

04:02.083 --> 04:04.667
SALINE DRIP, STAT!

04:04.709 --> 04:07.042
I LOVE SAYING "STAT."

04:07.083 --> 04:08.709
I WONDER WHAT IT MEANS.

04:07.083 --> 04:08.709
( chuckles )

04:09.709 --> 04:11.375
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.375
BLESS YOU.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.042
NO NEED TO THANK US.

04:12.417 --> 04:14.042
( chuckles )

04:14.083 --> 04:15.667
I'M NOT.

04:14.083 --> 04:15.667
YOU'RE ABOUT TO SNEEZE

04:15.709 --> 04:16.834
LIKE A LITTLE KITTEN,

04:16.875 --> 04:18.709
AND IT'S ADORABLE.

04:21.375 --> 04:22.584
( high-pitched sneezing )

04:26.083 --> 04:28.459
THIS IS GREAT.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.459
MY ENGLISH TEACHER,

04:28.500 --> 04:29.751
MS. KESSLER,

04:28.500 --> 04:29.751
DOES THIS THING

04:29.792 --> 04:31.459
WHERE SHE RANDOMLY

04:29.792 --> 04:31.459
CALLS ON KIDS

04:31.500 --> 04:33.042
AND PUTS THEM ON THE SPOT.

04:33.083 --> 04:35.167
I WONDER IF TIMELINE CAN TELL ME

04:33.083 --> 04:35.167
WHEN SHE'S GONNA CALL ON ME.

04:35.209 --> 04:38.042
OR YOU COULD JUST

04:35.209 --> 04:38.042
DO YOUR HOMEWORK

04:35.209 --> 04:38.042
LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.626
AND RISK LEARNING STUFF

04:39.667 --> 04:41.083
BUT  NOT </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> GETTING CALLED ON?</font>

04:41.125 --> 04:42.667
THAT'S CRAZY TALK.

04:43.709 --> 04:44.792
JUST BE CAREFUL, KAZ.

04:44.834 --> 04:46.459
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH

04:44.834 --> 04:46.459
TIME-TRAVEL MOVIES

04:46.500 --> 04:48.876
TO KNOW THAT MESSING

04:46.500 --> 04:48.876
WITH THE FUTURE

04:46.500 --> 04:48.876
ONLY </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> CAUSES PROBLEMS.</font>

04:48.918 --> 04:50.083
AND THE  LAST </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> THING I NEED</font>

04:50.125 --> 04:52.292
IS TO SOMEHOW END UP

04:50.125 --> 04:52.292
BEING MY OWN FATHER.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.292
HEY, UH...

04:56.334 --> 04:57.584
TIMELINE?

04:57.626 --> 04:59.751
CAN YOU TELL ME WHEN MY

04:57.626 --> 04:59.751
TEACHER'S GONNA CALL ON ME

04:59.792 --> 05:00.751
AND WHAT SHE'LL ASK?

05:00.792 --> 05:03.834
I DON'T KNOW.

05:00.792 --> 05:03.834
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T.

05:03.876 --> 05:06.125
OH, COME ONE.

05:03.876 --> 05:06.125
I--YOU TELL SUPERHEROES

05:06.167 --> 05:09.167
THE FUTURE ALL THE TIME,

05:06.167 --> 05:09.167
AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENS.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.876
IT'S JUST A POP QUIZ.

05:10.918 --> 05:14.167
FINE. I GUESS IT'S

05:10.918 --> 05:14.167
NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

05:14.209 --> 05:16.083
BUT YOU'RE ONLY

05:14.209 --> 05:16.083
CHEATING YOURSELF.

05:16.125 --> 05:18.042
YEAH? WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

05:18.083 --> 05:21.751
SHE'LL CALL ON YOU TOMORROW

05:18.083 --> 05:21.751
AT 1:14 P.M.

OH, COOL.

05:30.083 --> 05:33.459
UH, 2002 IN BALTIMORE?

05:35.834 --> 05:37.334
THIS IS AMAZING.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.125
I AM HAVING A GREAT

DO I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE?

06:08.500 --> 06:09.751
( gasping )

06:08.500 --> 06:09.751
OF COURSE NOT.

06:09.792 --> 06:12.626
WHERE COULD YOU

06:09.792 --> 06:12.626
POSSIBLY KNOW HER FROM?

06:19.083 --> 06:21.167
SO, HOW WAS YOUR

06:19.083 --> 06:21.167
FIRST CLASS?

06:21.209 --> 06:22.542
DID YOU FIND EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:22.584 --> 06:23.584
IT WAS GREAT!

06:36.876 --> 06:38.375
MY ARM.

06:39.709 --> 06:41.042
GUS?

06:41.083 --> 06:43.876
YEP. HE INVITED ME

06:41.083 --> 06:43.876
TO JOIN THE MARCHING BAND.

06:45.167 --> 06:46.626
IS THIS CALLED A BOOTY?

06:46.667 --> 06:49.083
BECAUSE HE TOLD ME I SHOULD

06:46.667 --> 06:49.083
STAND OUT FRONT AND SHAKE MINE.

06:50.417 --> 06:51.918
I DID SAY THAT, DIDN'T I?

06:55.792 --> 06:58.042
HOW ON EARTH DOES CONNIE

06:58.083 --> 06:59.918
THINK  GUS </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> IS COOL?</font>

06:59.959 --> 07:02.834
I DON'T KNOW.

06:59.959 --> 07:02.834
BUT THIS IS FANTASTIC!

07:02.876 --> 07:05.042
I'VE WANTED TO GET GUS

07:02.876 --> 07:05.042
OFF MY SCENT FOR YEARS.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.667
ESPECIALLY AT MARCHING BAND!

07:06.709 --> 07:09.125
I'VE TRIED DISGUISES,

07:06.709 --> 07:09.125
SMOKE SCREENS,

07:09.167 --> 07:11.417
EVEN LOOK-ALIKE

07:09.167 --> 07:11.417
JORDAN DECOYS.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.417

07:12.500 --> 07:14.500
OH, THERE'S ONE NOW.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.834
CHILDREN'S LIVES

07:21.834 --> 07:23.834
WERE DARK AND MISERABLE--

07:23.876 --> 07:25.584
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS...

07:25.626 --> 07:27.792
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

07:27.834 --> 07:30.167
LET'S RE-CREATE

07:27.834 --> 07:30.167
THOSE CONDITIONS

07:30.209 --> 07:32.250
WITH A POP ORAL QUIZ.

07:32.292 --> 07:33.292

07:34.834 --> 07:35.834
YOU'RE UP.

FINISH THIS QUOTE.

07:35.876 --> 07:38.292
"IT WAS THE B--"

07:38.334 --> 07:40.709
"THE BEST OF TIMES,

07:38.334 --> 07:40.709
IT WAS THE WORST OF TIMES,

IT WAS THE SEASON

07:49.500 --> 07:51.834
KIND OF A RUN-ON SENTENCE,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.834
IF YOU ASK ME.

07:53.209 --> 07:54.792
( clears throat )

07:54.834 --> 07:58.667
THAT WAS, SHOCKINGLY,

07:54.834 --> 07:58.667
CORRECT, KAZ.

07:58.709 --> 08:00.751
NOW, WHEN WAS CH--

08:00.792 --> 08:02.792
CHARLES DICKENS WAS BORN

08:04.584 --> 08:07.292
64 MILES SOUTHWEST OF LONDON--

08:07.334 --> 08:11.167
OR 103 KILOMETERS, FOR YOU

08:07.334 --> 08:11.167
FANS OF THE METRIC SYSTEM.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.876
ALL RIGHT.

08:14.918 --> 08:18.751
WHAT CHARACTER STILL

08:14.918 --> 08:18.751
WEARS A FADED WEDDING DRESS

08:18.792 --> 08:21.375
AFTER BEING LEFT--

FROM  GREAT EXPECTATIONS.</font>

08:21.417 --> 08:23.709
OH, AND, UH,

08:21.417 --> 08:23.709
SPEAKING OF WEDDING DRESSES,

08:23.751 --> 08:25.584
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO SPEND

08:23.751 --> 08:25.584
TOO MUCH ON YOURS

08:25.626 --> 08:26.751
BECAUSE YOUR FIANCE,

08:25.626 --> 08:26.751
BRUCE,

08:26.792 --> 08:28.667
WILL BE BREAKING OFF

08:26.792 --> 08:28.667
THE ENGAGEMENT TONIGHT.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.417
OH, BUT IT'S ALL

08:29.667 --> 08:31.417
FOR THE BEST

08:31.459 --> 08:33.667
BECAUSE ON TUESDAY

08:31.459 --> 08:33.667
HE GETS ARRESTED

08:31.459 --> 08:33.667
FOR IDENTITY THEFT,

08:33.708 --> 08:36.375
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA

08:33.708 --> 08:36.375
CANCEL YOUR CREDIT CARDS.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.042
HOW COULD CONNIE

08:44.000 --> 08:46.042
POSSIBLY LIKE GUS?

08:46.083 --> 08:47.042
I DON'T GET IT, JORDAN.

08:47.083 --> 08:48.542
THAT'S NOT ME.

08:50.918 --> 08:51.959
I'M OVER HERE...

08:52.000 --> 08:55.417
ENJOYING THE BEAUTIFUL

08:52.000 --> 08:55.417
GUS-FREE ZONE.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.042
OH, NO. INCOMING!

08:58.083 --> 09:01.542
GET READY, AMANDA.

08:58.083 --> 09:01.542
THIS IS WHAT YOU TRAINED FOR.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.000
OH, HEY JORDAN.

09:05.876 --> 09:07.250
( giggles )

09:05.876 --> 09:07.250
OLIVER,

09:07.292 --> 09:09.000
LOOK WHAT GUS CAN DO.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.709
( playing note )

09:10.709 --> 09:12.709
( giggling )

09:14.751 --> 09:16.042
WHAT CAN I SAY?

09:16.083 --> 09:19.000
CHICKS DIG THE NOSE TROMBONE.

09:20.542 --> 09:21.751
WE DO.

09:23.083 --> 09:25.000
MARCHING BAND

09:23.083 --> 09:25.000
IS THE BEST.

09:26.042 --> 09:27.709
IT SURE IS.

09:27.751 --> 09:30.375
WHICH IS WHY I, TOO,

09:27.751 --> 09:30.375
WOULD LIKE TO JOIN.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.042
YOU WANNA BE IN THE BAND?

09:32.083 --> 09:33.751
DO YOU PLAY THE OBOE?

09:33.792 --> 09:34.959
YES.

09:33.792 --> 09:34.959
( scoffs )

09:35.000 --> 09:36.792
I AM A GREAT "OBOER."

09:38.000 --> 09:39.667
"OBOE-BIAN"?

09:39.709 --> 09:41.500
"OBOE-BAGGINS"?

09:42.542 --> 09:43.709
I PLAY THE OBOE.

09:45.083 --> 09:48.042
WELL, WE HAVE

09:45.083 --> 09:48.042
PRETTY HIGH STANDARDS</font>

09:48.083 --> 09:49.751

09:53.626 --> 09:55.375
NOW DOUBLE TIME.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.334
TRIPLE TIME.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.334
AND KNEES UP!

09:57.375 --> 09:59.042
NOW SPIN!

09:59.083 --> 10:00.542
FASTER!

10:00.584 --> 10:01.792
LIKE A DREIDEL!

10:03.042 --> 10:04.542
IT'S A SPINNING TOP...

10:04.584 --> 10:07.000
POPULAR ON THE JEWISH

10:04.584 --> 10:07.000
HOLIDAY OF "CHHHHANUKKAH."

10:10.876 --> 10:13.000

10:15.792 --> 10:17.375
NOT BAD.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.042
YOU SHOW REAL PROMISE.

10:19.083 --> 10:22.000
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T HAVE

10:19.083 --> 10:22.000
ANY OBOES IN MARCHING BAND.

10:24.834 --> 10:26.834
OLIVER-- ( grunts )

10:26.876 --> 10:28.792
IT'S PROBABLY BEST

10:26.876 --> 10:28.792
THAT YOU'RE NOT IN THE BAND.

10:28.834 --> 10:32.042
NOTHING PERSONAL,

10:28.834 --> 10:32.042
BUT I WANT TO CARVE

10:28.834 --> 10:32.042
MY OWN PATH HERE.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.459
I DON'T WANNA JUST

10:32.083 --> 10:34.459
BE "OLIVER'S FRIEND."

10:34.500 --> 10:38.000
BELIEVE ME, I DON'T WANT YOU

10:34.500 --> 10:38.000
TO "JUST BE OLIVER'S FRIEND,"

10:34.500 --> 10:38.000
EITHER.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.667
Gus: HEY, CONNIE,

10:40.709 --> 10:42.876
YOU THINK NOSE TROMBONE

10:40.709 --> 10:42.876
IS COOL?

10:42.918 --> 10:45.042
CHECK THIS OUT.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.334
( playing notes )

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
ISN'T HE THE COOLEST?

11:00.876 --> 11:01.876
WRONG!

11:03.083 --> 11:05.918
TIMELINE, THANKS

11:03.083 --> 11:05.918
FOR TELLING ME THE FUTURE.

11:05.959 --> 11:08.417
I TOTALLY ACED MY POP QUIZ.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.876
WELL, IT'S ALMOST

11:08.459 --> 11:10.876
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

11:10.918 --> 11:13.000
I TRIED TO DO LESS,

11:10.918 --> 11:13.000
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LET ME.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.876
CAN YOU TELL ME MORE

11:14.834 --> 11:16.876
ABOUT THE FUTURE?

11:16.918 --> 11:18.417
MAYBE WHAT I'M GETTING

11:16.918 --> 11:18.417
FOR CHRISTMAS

11:18.459 --> 11:20.751
SO I KNOW WHETHER

11:18.459 --> 11:20.751
TO BE GOOD OR NOT?

11:20.792 --> 11:23.042
HERE'S SOMETHING

11:20.792 --> 11:23.042
YOU MIGHT FIND INTERESTING:

11:23.083 --> 11:27.042
IN 15 MINUTES, YOUR FRIEND

11:23.083 --> 11:27.042
OLIVER WILL BE IN MORTAL DANGER.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.792
WHAT? THAT'S TERRIBLE.

11:28.834 --> 11:31.042
WELL, YOU WON'T HAVE

11:28.834 --> 11:31.042
TO GRIEVE FOR LONG.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.626
OH, WHY NOT?

11:31.083 --> 11:33.626
BECAUSE IN 16 MINUTES,

11:33.667 --> 11:35.626
THE APOCALYPSE

11:33.667 --> 11:35.626
WILL BE UPON US

11:35.667 --> 11:37.667
AND LIFE AS WE KNOW IT

11:35.667 --> 11:37.667
WILL CEASE TO EXIST.

11:37.709 --> 11:40.042
( gasps )

11:37.709 --> 11:40.042
AND IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT

11:40.083 --> 11:42.500
FOR MAKING ME TELL YOU

11:40.083 --> 11:42.500
ABOUT THAT POP QUIZ.

11:42.542 --> 11:44.834
YOU SAID IT WOULDN'T

11:42.542 --> 11:44.834
BE THE END OF THE WORLD.

11:44.876 --> 11:47.834
SO I WAS WRONG.

11:44.876 --> 11:47.834
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

11:47.876 --> 11:50.834
I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD

11:47.876 --> 11:50.834
STOP USING THAT EXPRESSION.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.500
I DON'T THINK YOU

11:50.876 --> 11:52.500
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

11:52.542 --> 11:55.083
THE WORLD IS LITERALLY ENDING!

11:55.125 --> 11:56.334
( screams )

11:56.375 --> 11:59.042
GLAD YOU FINALLY UNDERSTAND

11:56.375 --> 11:59.042
HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

11:59.083 --> 12:00.167
IT'S DEADLY SERIOUS,

12:00.209 --> 12:01.792
BUT THAT'S

12:00.209 --> 12:01.792
NOT WHY I SCREAMED.

12:01.834 --> 12:03.083
( screams )

12:03.125 --> 12:04.834
SEE, THAT'S WHY I SCREAMED.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.667
OKAY--WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

12:10.083 --> 12:13.667
"THE APOCALYPSE WILL COME

12:10.083 --> 12:13.667
IN 16 MINUTES"?

12:13.709 --> 12:15.125
HOW?

12:13.709 --> 12:15.125
CRIMSON DEMON

12:15.167 --> 12:18.000
IS PREPARING TO LAUNCH

12:15.167 --> 12:18.000
AN ALL-OUT ASSAULT ON HUMANITY.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.209
AND NOW IT'S 15 MINUTES.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.751
CRIMSON DEMON?

12:22.792 --> 12:24.542
THE EVIL EMPEROR OF FIRE?

12:24.584 --> 12:26.584
THAT CAN'T BE.

12:24.584 --> 12:26.584
HE'S NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH.

12:28.542 --> 12:31.125

12:28.542 --> 12:31.125

12:39.542 --> 12:43.042
WHY WOULD IT THINK I SAID THAT?

YOU JUST NEED TO ENUNCIATE.

12:59.876 --> 13:02.918
AND MATT DEMON.

HOW? THE PORTAL

13:12.834 --> 13:14.709
CAN'T BE OPENED

13:14.751 --> 13:16.042
UNLESS THREE CONDITIONS

13:14.751 --> 13:16.042
ARE MET:

13:16.083 --> 13:18.042
FIRST, "THE FOOL

THE FIRST CONDITION

13:24.125 --> 13:26.834

YOU GOT ME THERE.

RIP IN THE PORTAL WILL OPEN.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.626
THE OTHER TWO CONDITIONS

WILL SOON FOLLOW.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.834

14:01.167 --> 14:04.083
JORDAN, I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU

14:01.167 --> 14:04.083
HATE DOING THINGS FOR OTHERS.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.959
AH, IT'S THE WORST.

14:07.042 --> 14:09.167
BUT I WAS HOPING YOU

14:07.042 --> 14:09.167
COULD, MAYBE, HELP ME

14:09.209 --> 14:10.334
KEEP GUS AWAY FROM CONNIE--

14:10.375 --> 14:12.042
FOR HER OWN GOOD.

14:12.083 --> 14:14.834
I-I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE

14:12.083 --> 14:14.834
I'M NOT IN THE MARCHING BAND.

14:14.876 --> 14:16.209
WAIT A MINUTE.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.876
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

14:18.918 --> 14:20.709
YOU </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> HAVE A CRUSH</font>

14:18.918 --> 14:20.709
ON CONNIE.

14:20.751 --> 14:22.042
PSSH. PFFT.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.042
WHAT? NO I DON'T.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.125
( mimicking )

14:24.083 --> 14:25.125
YES YOU DO.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.250
LOOK AT YOUR NOSTRILS.

14:27.292 --> 14:30.083
EVERY TIME YOU LIE,

14:27.292 --> 14:30.083
YOUR NOSTRILS FLARE.

14:30.125 --> 14:32.959
COME ON, BOYS!

14:30.125 --> 14:32.959
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' TO ME?

14:33.959 --> 14:35.209
LISTEN, OLIVER--

14:35.250 --> 14:37.042
I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU.

14:37.083 --> 14:39.125
BUT I'D  LOVE </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> NOT TO.</font>

14:39.167 --> 14:41.209
AND I GOTTA FOLLOW MY HEART.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.083
THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY

14:45.083 --> 14:47.083
INTO THAT BAND.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.042
THANKS, PHILIP.

14:58.083 --> 15:00.042
AH, ONE QUESTION:

15:00.083 --> 15:02.000
HOW DO YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM

15:00.083 --> 15:02.000
IN THIS THING?

15:05.334 --> 15:06.918
NEW QUESTION:

15:06.959 --> 15:09.250
WHY </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> DID YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM</font>

15:06.959 --> 15:09.250
IN THIS THING?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.375
I KNOW YOU

15:16.792 --> 15:18.375
HAD TO FIND A DISGUISE,

15:18.417 --> 15:20.000
BUT WHY DID YOU PICK  THAT?</font>

15:21.959 --> 15:23.792
THE WORLD'S ENDING

15:21.959 --> 15:23.792
IN FIVE MINUTES.

15:23.834 --> 15:26.792
YOU WANT ME TO BE BURIED

15:23.834 --> 15:26.792
IN A TRENCH COAT?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.209
WAIT! I'M GETTING A VISION.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.000
THE NEXT CONDITION

15:30.250 --> 15:33.000
IS ABOUT TO BE MET.

15:33.042 --> 15:35.792
"NIGHT FALLS

15:33.042 --> 15:35.792
DURING THE DAYTIME."

15:35.834 --> 15:38.834
I DON'T GET IT.

15:35.834 --> 15:38.834
IT'S TOTALLY BRIGHT OUTSIDE.

15:38.876 --> 15:40.334
WOULD YOU WAIT ONE SECOND?

15:40.375 --> 15:42.751
YOU KIDS TODAY--

15:40.375 --> 15:42.751
YOU HAVE NO ATTENTION SPAN.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.959
LOOK.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.792
( band playing )</font>

15:52.876 --> 15:54.334
( music continuing )

16:08.500 --> 16:12.042
OH, "KNIGHT IN SHINING

16:08.500 --> 16:12.042
ARMOR FALLS."

16:12.083 --> 16:14.792
I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING.

16:14.834 --> 16:17.083
YEAH, WORDS

16:14.834 --> 16:17.083
THAT SOUND THE SAME

16:14.834 --> 16:17.083
BUT ARE SPELLED DIFFERENT

16:17.125 --> 16:19.834
ARE TRICKY FOR US

16:17.125 --> 16:19.834
FUTURE-SEERS.

16:19.876 --> 16:22.375
SO IS THE WEATHER.

16:19.876 --> 16:22.375
NO ONE CAN PREDICT IT.

16:22.417 --> 16:23.751
NO ONE.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.918
PHILIP, ARE YOU OKAY?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.042
OLIVER?! WHAT ARE YOU

16:35.500 --> 16:38.042
DOING IN THERE?

16:38.083 --> 16:39.500
UM...

16:39.542 --> 16:41.500
I TOLD YOU I WANT

16:39.542 --> 16:41.500
TO DO MY OWN THING,

16:41.542 --> 16:43.876
AND THEN YOU DRESS UP

16:41.542 --> 16:43.876
SO YOU CAN FOLLOW ME AROUND?

16:43.918 --> 16:47.042
YEAH, DUDE, YOU'RE

16:43.918 --> 16:47.042
MAKING THIS WEIRD.

16:47.083 --> 16:49.334
NOW IF YOU'LL

16:47.083 --> 16:49.334
EXCUSE US,

16:49.375 --> 16:51.375
I HAVE A NOSE

16:49.375 --> 16:51.375
TROMBONE SOLO.

16:55.167 --> 16:57.083
I NORMALLY

16:55.167 --> 16:57.083
DON'T LIKE TO HELP,

16:57.125 --> 17:01.000
BUT, YEAH, THIS IS

16:57.125 --> 17:01.000
FOR EVERYONE'S BENEFIT.

17:09.876 --> 17:11.334
I HATE TO BREAK THIS TO YOU,

17:11.375 --> 17:14.416
BUT CRIMSON DEMON

17:11.375 --> 17:14.416
IS JUST A KID IN

17:11.375 --> 17:14.416
A MASCOT COSTUME.

17:14.459 --> 17:16.125
WAIT FOR IT.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.250
IT'S CRIMSON DEMON!

17:26.291 --> 17:28.459
OLIVER!

17:26.291 --> 17:28.459
KAZ?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.042
Oliver:

17:28.500 --> 17:30.042
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:30.083 --> 17:31.500
WHY IS TIMELINE

17:30.083 --> 17:31.500
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

17:31.542 --> 17:34.167
THE WORLD'S ABOUT TO END!

17:31.542 --> 17:34.167
WHAT?

17:34.209 --> 17:36.584
CRIMSON DEMON IS

17:34.209 --> 17:36.584
IN THAT MASCOT COSTUME!

17:36.626 --> 17:38.876
HE'S PLANNING ON

17:36.626 --> 17:38.876
OPENING THE PORTAL

17:36.626 --> 17:38.876
TO THE LOWER DIMENSION

17:38.918 --> 17:40.083
TO RELEASE HIS DEMON

17:38.918 --> 17:40.083
BROTHERS!

17:40.125 --> 17:41.918
WE HAVE TO CALL IN

17:40.125 --> 17:41.918
SOME SUPERHEROES FOR HELP!

17:41.959 --> 17:43.083
THERE'S NO TIME!

17:43.125 --> 17:45.959
( blows discordant note )

17:46.000 --> 17:47.167
IT'S THE "CHORD OF DISCORD"!

17:55.000 --> 17:56.209
THE PORTAL'S OPENING!

17:56.250 --> 17:57.459
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!

17:57.500 --> 17:59.042
WAIT! I HAVE A THEORY.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.042
MAYBE IF YOU ENVISION

17:59.083 --> 18:01.042
THE FUTURE

18:01.083 --> 18:03.042
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY

18:01.083 --> 18:03.042
RECALLING THE PAST,

18:03.083 --> 18:05.250
YOU CAN TEMPORARILY

18:03.083 --> 18:05.250
FREEZE THE PRESENT.

18:05.292 --> 18:09.042
IT MIGHT WORK...

18:05.292 --> 18:09.042
OR IT MIGHT TEAR

18:05.292 --> 18:09.042
A HOLE IN THE UNIVERSE.

18:09.083 --> 18:11.250
BUT IF THAT HAPPENS,

18:09.083 --> 18:11.250
IT'S NOT THE END

18:09.083 --> 18:11.250
OF THE WORLD.

18:11.292 --> 18:14.918
IT IS! STOP SAYING THAT!

18:17.667 --> 18:19.626
WHY DIDN'T  WE </font> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> FREEZE?</font>

18:19.667 --> 18:21.042
OR HIM?

18:21.083 --> 18:22.584
YOU'RE CRITICIZING ME?

18:22.626 --> 18:25.667
I'VE JUST INVENTED A WAY

18:22.626 --> 18:25.667
TO FREEZE TIME!

18:25.709 --> 18:27.500
I CAN'T HOLD THIS

18:25.709 --> 18:27.500
FOR LONG!

18:27.542 --> 18:30.042
YOU CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE.

18:27.542 --> 18:30.042
TELL US WHAT TO DO.

18:30.083 --> 18:33.000
FOR STARTERS, I SUGGEST

18:30.083 --> 18:33.000
WE ALL TAKE ONE BIG

18:30.083 --> 18:33.000
STEP BACKWARD.

18:36.542 --> 18:38.918
( evil roar )

18:41.209 --> 18:43.667
KAZ, DUCK!

18:43.709 --> 18:45.125
OLIVER, PUNCH HIM NOW!

18:47.459 --> 18:49.042
EVERYBODY JUMP!

19:02.292 --> 19:05.709
SKYLAR, KICK HIM

19:02.292 --> 19:05.709
BETWEEN THE SHOULDER BLADES!

19:02.292 --> 19:05.709
THAT'S HIS WEAK SPOT!

19:05.751 --> 19:08.000
HIS "DEMON PARTS"

19:05.751 --> 19:08.000
ARE THERE.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.667
( discordant note

19:25.083 --> 19:27.667
trails off )

19:27.709 --> 19:29.042
( chuckling )

19:29.083 --> 19:33.209
WOW. THAT NOTE

19:29.083 --> 19:33.209
WAS... AMAZING!

19:33.250 --> 19:36.042
RIGHT, JORDAN?

19:36.083 --> 19:38.250
THAT ONE COST ME

19:36.083 --> 19:38.250
A MONTH'S ALLOWANCE, BUT...

19:38.292 --> 19:40.500
BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT.

19:43.209 --> 19:44.334
WE DID IT!

19:44.375 --> 19:46.209
I KNEW ALL ALONG

19:44.375 --> 19:46.209
THAT YOU WOULD.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.042
THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU

19:46.250 --> 19:48.042
JUST TELL ME THAT?

19:48.083 --> 19:50.709
I DIDN'T WANT TO SPOIL

19:48.083 --> 19:50.709
THE ENDING FOR YOU.

19:54.626 --> 19:56.584
LISTEN, SKYLAR,

19:56.626 --> 19:59.042
I'M SORRY FOR TRYING

19:56.626 --> 19:59.042
TO HORN IN ON YOUR TERRITORY.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.542
WELL, I KNOW  EXACTLY</font>

19:59.083 --> 20:00.542
WHY YOU DID IT.

20:00.584 --> 20:02.042
YOU DO?

20:02.083 --> 20:03.626
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.667
YOU WERE TOTALLY,

20:03.667 --> 20:06.667
ONE HUNDRED PER CENT...

20:06.709 --> 20:10.083
SURE THAT I CAN'T

20:06.709 --> 20:10.083
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF

20:06.709 --> 20:10.083
IN THE NORMAL WORLD.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.667
YEP.

20:11.709 --> 20:14.334
THAT'S THE REASON.

20:11.709 --> 20:14.334
THE ONLY REASON.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.667
LOOK, OLIVER, I KNOW

20:16.083 --> 20:18.667
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING

20:16.083 --> 20:18.667
OUT FOR ME,

20:18.709 --> 20:20.083
BUT I'LL BE FINE.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.667
OKAY.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.292
BUT I HAVE TO ASK,

20:23.334 --> 20:25.792
WHY WOULD YOU EVER

20:23.334 --> 20:25.792
WANT TO GO OUT WITH GUS?

20:25.834 --> 20:27.792
I DON'T WANT

20:25.834 --> 20:27.792
TO GO OUT WITH GUS.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.584
I'VE JUST BEEN A LITTLE

20:27.834 --> 20:29.584
HOMESICK LATELY,

20:29.626 --> 20:31.375
AND HE REMINDS ME

20:29.626 --> 20:31.375
OF A DORENBOSCH--

20:31.417 --> 20:34.500
THE PETS WE HAVE

20:31.417 --> 20:34.500
ON MY PLANET.

20:36.584 --> 20:38.042
WOW.

20:38.083 --> 20:40.417
THE RESEMBLANCE

20:38.083 --> 20:40.417
IS UNCANNY...

20:40.459 --> 20:41.667
AND DISTURBING.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.250
LOOK AT HIM.

20:43.292 --> 20:45.667
HE'S SO CUTE!

20:45.709 --> 20:47.417
I JUST WISH

20:45.709 --> 20:47.417
HE HAD A LITTLE TAIL.

20:47.459 --> 20:49.042
I DO. YOU WANNA SEE IT?

20:49.083 --> 20:50.751
I KEEP IT IN MY WALLET.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.751
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.209
AND TELL MY COUSIN HORACE

21:02.792 --> 21:05.209
I DON'T FORGIVE HIM

21:05.250 --> 21:07.375
FOR BEING LATE

21:05.250 --> 21:07.375
TO THE FAMILY REUNION.

21:07.417 --> 21:09.334
WHEN WAS IT?

21:07.417 --> 21:09.334
IT'S NEXT MONTH.

21:10.876 --> 21:12.626
WAIT.

21:12.667 --> 21:15.667
BEFORE YOU GO,

21:12.667 --> 21:15.667
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T ASK,

21:15.709 --> 21:17.584
BUT IS THERE ANY CHANCE

21:15.709 --> 21:17.584
YOU CAN TELL ME

21:17.626 --> 21:19.292
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

21:17.626 --> 21:19.292
WITH ME AND SKYLAR?

21:19.334 --> 21:23.292
I SEE HER FALLING

21:19.334 --> 21:23.292
FOR YOU IN A BIG WAY.

21:23.334 --> 21:27.000
REALLY? THAT'S AMAZING!

21:23.334 --> 21:27.000
