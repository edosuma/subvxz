WEBVTT

00:00.545 --> 00:02.147
GATA:
Man, y'all ain't
gonna believe this.

00:02.147 --> 00:03.651
Nigga, we had the club lit.

00:03.651 --> 00:05.555
That shit was going up,
I'm telling y'all, man.

00:05.555 --> 00:07.458
We was in the section,
me and LD, popping bottles,

00:07.458 --> 00:09.095
whoopty whoop,
with the whole squad, bro.

00:09.095 --> 00:10.097
Look, check this shit out.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.399
The whole lineup

00:11.399 --> 00:12.536
of the Dallas
motherfucking Cowboys.

00:12.536 --> 00:14.640
Goddamn. Hey, peep that, bro.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.510
- Damn.
- That's CeeDee Lamb
right there, dawg.

00:16.510 --> 00:18.246
- Yeah.
- STRETCH: Man, this is
like a fucking movie.

00:18.246 --> 00:20.518
Man, fuck a movie.
This my reality now, bro.

00:20.518 --> 00:22.354
I was in there with three
baddies at the dinner, bro.

00:22.354 --> 00:23.558
Eating at the same time.

00:23.558 --> 00:25.795
Hey, bro, you VMA Gata now.

00:25.795 --> 00:27.699
- Huh, I heard that.
- Come on, now. Hey, you remember

00:27.699 --> 00:29.202
kicking it with Gata
back in the day?

00:29.202 --> 00:30.337
He used to live here.

00:30.337 --> 00:32.041
How would I not remember?
(scoffs)

00:32.041 --> 00:33.611
Hey, man, that was, like,
a decade ago. I don't know

00:33.611 --> 00:35.715
- how no damn eight-year-old mind
work, bro.
- (scoffs)

00:35.715 --> 00:37.586
So, I see you pulled up
to Icebox today, huh?

00:37.586 --> 00:39.155
Man, I had to go get
iced out, bro.

00:39.155 --> 00:41.493
Got that rose gold
Cuban bust down.

00:41.493 --> 00:43.396
That shit go crazy. Hey, that's
much better than that shit

00:43.396 --> 00:45.467
from the swap meet that turned
your goddamn neck green, bro.

00:45.467 --> 00:46.837
- (Malik chuckles)
- For real.

00:46.837 --> 00:48.473
Y'all must be making
some real bread on tour.

00:48.473 --> 00:50.244
Man, fuck tour.
I got hit songs coming out.

00:50.244 --> 00:52.448
Future earnings. Hey,
LD, tell them about that song

00:52.448 --> 00:53.851
I got with Rick Ross the Boss.

00:53.851 --> 00:55.622
- Nigga, that shit hard.
- Whoo.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.059
You know, I'm not sure
I'd call it a song quite yet.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.496
My friend Benny made a beat
that Rick Ross rapped to,

00:59.496 --> 01:01.366
like, five years ago.
Now, that Rick Ross verse

01:01.366 --> 01:03.136
is on Benny's hard drive.
He took that,

01:03.136 --> 01:04.573
added his own verse
to it, but, like,

01:04.573 --> 01:06.409
Rick Ross doesn't know
he exists.

01:06.409 --> 01:07.679
- It's a whole clearance...
- Man, nobody give a fuck about

01:07.679 --> 01:09.081
- them details like that, dawg.
- Just...

01:09.081 --> 01:10.350
Ross gonna remember me, bro.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.854
Trust me.
I got him some gas-ass weed,

01:11.854 --> 01:13.456
got him the lemon pepper pizza,

01:13.456 --> 01:15.294
and he gonna be
at the strip club tonight.

01:15.294 --> 01:16.462
We gonna turn that shit up,
and we gonna get that verse.

01:16.462 --> 01:17.699
Sure, sorry.

01:17.699 --> 01:19.536
I'm just dealing
with this situation.

01:19.536 --> 01:21.607
You guys know who
Killer Mike is, right?

01:21.607 --> 01:23.577
- BOTH: Hell yeah.
- Bro, fuck you mean?

01:23.577 --> 01:25.581
So, earlier today
I tweeted, "Atlanta,

01:25.581 --> 01:26.884
holler at your boy tonight."

01:26.884 --> 01:28.386
He took that tweet,

01:28.386 --> 01:29.823
retweeted it with the comment,

01:29.823 --> 01:32.428
"I don't know about this man."

01:33.463 --> 01:34.833
What does he mean by that?

01:34.833 --> 01:36.670
"I don't know about this man."

01:36.670 --> 01:39.241
Does he mean, like, "I don't
know about this tweet, man,"

01:39.241 --> 01:42.582
or "I don't know about
this man," like my soul?

01:42.582 --> 01:43.851
He real political for sure, bro.

01:43.851 --> 01:45.487
Like, he one of them folks

01:45.487 --> 01:47.224
that's trying to keep
the courtrooms from using

01:47.224 --> 01:49.328
rap lyrics as evidence
and all that shit. Like, he real

01:49.328 --> 01:50.765
pivotal in the Black community.

01:50.765 --> 01:52.836
What does that
have to do with me?

01:52.836 --> 01:54.338
Is he, like,
implying that I'm, like,

01:54.338 --> 01:55.742
bad for the Black community?

01:55.742 --> 01:57.478
Bro, didn't you say
you called him a boy?

01:57.478 --> 01:58.914
I didn't call him a boy.
I said, "Holler at your boy."

01:58.914 --> 02:00.150
- I'm the boy in that situation.
- STRETCH: Oh...

02:00.150 --> 02:01.185
Bro, you know, Twitter be having

02:01.185 --> 02:02.488
miscommunications and shit.

02:02.488 --> 02:03.924
- Yeah.
- DAVE: Like... he goes online

02:03.924 --> 02:04.860
and starts talking shit
without even knowing me?

02:04.860 --> 02:06.497
That's such... hearsay.

02:06.497 --> 02:08.300
Sound like you in
a real conundrum, my brother.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.803
Well, what do I say back to him?

02:09.803 --> 02:11.306
I've, like, already written
three drafts,

02:11.306 --> 02:12.709
- and I keep deleting it.
- Hey, Stretch,

02:12.709 --> 02:14.345
this is a rental, bro.
We in the trenches.

02:14.345 --> 02:15.648
You think I can pull this
around back, or what?

02:15.648 --> 02:16.750
I got some blankets
we can put over

02:16.750 --> 02:18.621

Look at Dave over there,
bossed up with Ross.

02:33.517 --> 02:36.623
Can't believe I manifested
getting that verse.

02:36.623 --> 02:38.360
LD's really over there
putting that work in,

02:38.360 --> 02:39.362
connecting them dots.

02:39.362 --> 02:41.399
- What's up, baby?
- Hi.

02:41.399 --> 02:43.370
- Hi. Want to touch me?
- Honestly, I didn't,
I didn't expect...

02:43.370 --> 02:45.708
Uh, no. If I touched you, I'd
get a full-on boner. I can't.

02:45.708 --> 02:47.946
No, I will get hard, and if I...

02:47.946 --> 02:49.916
Don't get me a lap dance,
whatever you do,

02:49.916 --> 02:51.319
'cause any friction
will make me hard.

02:51.319 --> 02:52.856
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.
- Any...

02:52.856 --> 02:54.559
- Yo.
- Oh, please, every guy
gets erect.

02:54.559 --> 02:55.795
Chill the fuck out.

02:55.795 --> 02:57.532
It's not my control.
Honestly, I-I...

02:57.532 --> 02:59.569
My fucking 11-year-old cousin,
during Thanksgiving,

02:59.569 --> 03:00.972
was sitting on my lap.
We watched a movie,

03:00.972 --> 03:02.575
and I was, like, proud
that nothing even moved.

03:02.575 --> 03:03.644
You know what I mean?

03:03.644 --> 03:05.548
What about me hitting on you?

03:05.548 --> 03:08.286
Is that, like, normal?
Oh, I blocked your throw. Sorry.

03:08.286 --> 03:09.589
You want to go over there?

03:09.589 --> 03:10.758
Hell yeah, I'm trying
to go over there.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.294
- What you mean?
- All right.

03:12.294 --> 03:13.931
You got to put this on
for me, big homie.

03:13.931 --> 03:16.235
- Bro, what the fuck?
- Bro, come on, man.

03:16.235 --> 03:18.339
I'm trying to look official,
like a referee with a whistle.

03:18.339 --> 03:20.712
All right, bro. I'm sacrificing
pussy for your ass...

03:20.712 --> 03:21.714
Bro...

03:21.714 --> 03:23.249
Whenever I throw it,

03:23.249 --> 03:24.251
it doesn't even make it
to the woman.

03:24.251 --> 03:25.788
It, like, falls short. Ah,

03:25.788 --> 03:27.492
- that one grazed her ass.
- You got to work on it, man.

03:27.492 --> 03:29.395
You know, I didn't
sell my show out tonight, and

03:29.395 --> 03:31.934
part of me thinks it's 'cause
Killer Mike tweeted about me.

03:31.934 --> 03:33.904
Do you know Killer Mike?
Do you like him?

03:33.904 --> 03:36.275
- What's your deal with him?
- I know Killer Mike.

03:36.275 --> 03:37.812
Do you like him,
or do you fucking hate him?

03:37.812 --> 03:39.448
That's the homie.

03:39.448 --> 03:41.687
- He one of those.
- One of-- Yeah.

03:42.488 --> 03:43.590
Hey,
hey, hey.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.693
- Damn, bro.
- Hey, come on.

03:44.693 --> 03:46.362
Hey, watch out now.
I'm security for him, bro.

03:46.362 --> 03:47.866
One of those
smart motherfuckers.

03:47.866 --> 03:49.368
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He seems...

03:49.368 --> 03:51.507
Connected in the community
type shit.

03:51.507 --> 03:53.711
Yeah, so that's kind of why
I'm a little bit frazzled

03:53.711 --> 03:55.347
by the whole thing.
Imagine being me...

03:55.347 --> 03:57.317
Frazzled? What the fuck
does that mean? (laughs)

03:57.317 --> 03:59.656
- (laughs) Yeah.
- The fuck is frazzled?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.359
Hey, let me ask
a personal question.

04:01.359 --> 04:02.562
Talk to me.

04:02.562 --> 04:04.733
How much did that chain cost?

04:04.733 --> 04:06.770
This right here?

04:06.770 --> 04:08.541
Yeah.

04:08.541 --> 04:09.543
Quarter.

04:09.543 --> 04:10.945
Oh, only 25 grand.

04:10.945 --> 04:12.381
- That's not so bad.
- Oh, no, no.

04:12.381 --> 04:15.621
- Quarter million dollars.
- No.

04:15.621 --> 04:18.727
Stop. That's $250,000?

04:18.727 --> 04:21.399
- What's the reason
that you... Yeah.
- Yo, yo, check this out.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.869
It's actually priceless.

04:22.869 --> 04:25.006
- Yeah.
- And just because
you really my guy,

04:25.006 --> 04:27.444
- turn around.
- Stop. Really?

04:27.444 --> 04:28.446
Right now.

04:28.446 --> 04:29.816
Oh, my God.

04:29.816 --> 04:32.755
- 'Cause you my little homie.
- Wow. Cool.

04:32.755 --> 04:34.926
Quarter million dollars
on your neck.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.930
Hey, you don't see Lil Dicky
over there? I'm his hype man.

04:36.930 --> 04:38.634
That's our folks, man.
That's our folks. He talk--

04:38.634 --> 04:40.638
he chopping it up with Rick Ross
right now. Goddamn.

04:40.638 --> 04:43.644
Tomorrow I got something
really special going on.

04:43.644 --> 04:45.681
- What?
- A Black Brilliance brunch.

04:45.681 --> 04:48.687
The biggest Black
entrepreneurs, athletes,

04:48.687 --> 04:50.792
hustlers all under one roof.

04:50.792 --> 04:52.027
And I get to go?

04:52.027 --> 04:54.733
- You gonna fit right in.
- (both laugh)

04:54.733 --> 04:56.670
- No, no, no, no.
- Hey, man.
- Dave!

04:56.670 --> 04:58.674
- STRETCH: Hey, come on, man.
- GATA: Come get us, dude.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.343
Oh, you know what? Oh.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.314
Ooh...

05:02.314 --> 05:03.617
- I'll be right back.
- GATA: Dave.

05:03.617 --> 05:04.920
- STRETCH: Hey.
- GATA: Come on, man.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.557
DAVE:
Right on. Th-They're with me.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.059
See? I told you
we supposed to be over here.

05:08.059 --> 05:10.063
You got to relax, fall back.

05:10.063 --> 05:12.467
- ALL: Hey!
- (overlapping chatter)

05:12.467 --> 05:14.639
- Look at that shit!
- Oh, yeah.

05:14.639 --> 05:16.543
Damn. He let you hold
the piece like that?

05:16.543 --> 05:18.379
Honestly, I feel a little
Malibu's Most Wanted-esque

05:18.379 --> 05:20.383
right now. I'm probably gonna
just give it back to him.

05:20.383 --> 05:22.454
- (hip-hop playing)
- (crowd chatter)

05:27.665 --> 05:29.001
Where did he go?

05:31.105 --> 05:33.009
What the fuck?

05:35.480 --> 05:36.884
Excuse me.

05:36.884 --> 05:38.954
Do you know where
Rick Ross went?

05:38.954 --> 05:40.892
He gone.

05:42.996 --> 05:45.000
- (door chimes)
- I can't believe he just
left this with me.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.839
- It means he trusts you.
- It means he rich.

05:47.839 --> 05:49.676
It means he lacks judgment.

05:49.676 --> 05:51.647
But did you see the way that
me and him were vibing in there?

05:51.647 --> 05:52.682
(scoffs) Yeah.

05:52.682 --> 05:54.151
I mean, I felt like a bad bitch.

05:54.151 --> 05:55.888
- (chuckles)
- I really did.

05:55.888 --> 05:57.424
It was incredible. He invited me
to a brunch tomorrow.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.395
- Stop lying.
- Yeah, look.

05:59.395 --> 06:00.865
Wow.

06:00.865 --> 06:02.401
Damn, it's about to be
on and popping, bro.

06:02.401 --> 06:04.839
Future, Baby,
Gucci gonna be there.

06:04.839 --> 06:06.577
- Everyone's gonna be there.
- Aw, that shit is sick.
And you can give him the chain,

06:06.577 --> 06:08.146
and I can get the verse tomorrow.

06:08.146 --> 06:10.016
Yeah, I can give him the chain
tomorrow. No problem.

06:10.016 --> 06:11.485
It's actually
incredibly convenient.

06:11.485 --> 06:14.526
Hmm, but what if
Killer Mike is there?

06:14.526 --> 06:15.795
(scoffs) Whatever.

06:15.795 --> 06:17.064
Well, I'm just saying,
he could be.

06:17.064 --> 06:18.534
Man, you need to be seen
in them spots

06:18.534 --> 06:19.803
like that,
wiggling and gandering.

06:19.803 --> 06:21.072
You take a picture
with Rick Ross,

06:21.072 --> 06:23.176
you're legitimized.
Fuck Killer Mike.

06:23.176 --> 06:24.646
- (door chimes)
- (mouth full): I feel like
some people just, like,

06:24.646 --> 06:27.084
have a complex
where they feel like

06:27.084 --> 06:29.689
they have to prove something,
you know?

06:29.689 --> 06:30.992
You know what the fuck going on.

06:30.992 --> 06:32.695
- Yeah, boy.
- Oh, shit.
- Come on.

06:32.695 --> 06:34.064
- Keep 'em up.
- Fuck, dawg.
- (choking)

06:34.064 --> 06:35.935
- Come on, man.
- Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up,

06:35.935 --> 06:37.505
nigga. The fuck wrong with you?

06:37.505 --> 06:39.576
- Yeah, keep 'em up.
- (Dave choking)

06:39.576 --> 06:41.045
DUGGY: What the fuck wrong
with this nigga, man?

06:41.045 --> 06:43.918
Yo, I-- yo, I think
he choking, bro.

06:43.918 --> 06:46.022
- Shut the hell up.
- You all right, bro?

06:46.022 --> 06:47.625
No, I think he choking, bro.

06:47.625 --> 06:48.727
Yo, yo, yo, do that "Himlis"
"Helmet" shit.

06:48.727 --> 06:50.030
What the fuck is "Himlet"?

06:50.030 --> 06:51.165
Whatever that shit
y'all be pressing.

06:51.165 --> 06:52.735
Now do that shit
on the nigga ass.

06:52.735 --> 06:54.471
Nigga, I-I think
I know how to do that shit.

06:54.471 --> 06:55.741
- Um...
- (choking)

06:55.741 --> 06:57.444
DUGGY:
Don't touch him, stupid ass.

06:57.444 --> 06:58.948
You're gonna leave
motherfucking evidence on him.

06:58.948 --> 07:00.216
I'm gonna get fingerprints
on the nigga's skin, bro?

07:00.216 --> 07:01.553
DUGGY:
On his shirt, dumbass, boy.

07:01.553 --> 07:03.557
- You all right, bro?
- (coughs)

07:03.557 --> 07:05.695
(gasps)

07:05.695 --> 07:07.030
The fuck wrong with this nigga?

07:07.030 --> 07:08.634
- GATA: You good?
- It was a hot dog.

07:08.634 --> 07:10.003
DUGGY:
A hot dog?

07:10.003 --> 07:11.773
- Hey, give me that shit.
- (screams) Take it!

07:11.773 --> 07:13.877
- All right, all right,
all right, bro.
- Come on.

07:13.877 --> 07:15.848
- DAVE: Very valuable chain,
take that chain.
- What's in that pocket?

07:15.848 --> 07:17.585
Okay, here, take the cash.
I didn't pay for the cash.

07:17.585 --> 07:19.121
Wait, but can I have
my driver's license?

07:19.121 --> 07:20.691
It's so hard
to go back to the DMV.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.060
Can't believe this shit.

07:22.060 --> 07:24.499
Man, I do know how it is,
though, the DMV...

07:24.499 --> 07:25.868
- (overlapping shouting)
- Okay, don't shoot.

07:25.868 --> 07:27.437
- Please don't shoot.
- Get the fuck down.

07:30.544 --> 07:33.149
(Dave panting)

07:33.149 --> 07:35.788
DAVE: They took
the fucking chain, Gata.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.825
- GATA: Fuck, man.
- (door chimes)

07:42.134 --> 07:44.706
- Man, where the fuck was you at?
- Y'all praying?

07:47.845 --> 07:49.683
Yo, y'all heard anything
about a white boy

07:49.683 --> 07:52.054
getting his chain snatched?
Happened about a hour ago.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.791
Man, tap back in
if you do. Damn.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.695
Can we just call the police?

07:55.695 --> 07:56.930
Hell nah, we ain't calling
the police, bro.

07:56.930 --> 07:58.534
Why you want to get Ross

07:58.534 --> 07:59.736
attached to some shit
like this? That's Mickey.

07:59.736 --> 08:01.205
I ain't no rat.

08:01.205 --> 08:03.209
Mickey's a mouse.

08:03.209 --> 08:05.213
- (scoffs)
- I feel like we can just explain
to Rick what happened,

08:05.213 --> 08:07.217
and he'll understand.
He's a reasonable human being.

08:07.217 --> 08:08.954
Bro, we are not doing that.
You know I've been trying

08:08.954 --> 08:10.256
to get this verse cleared
with that nigga,

08:10.256 --> 08:11.660
man, come on.
I got people out here.

08:11.660 --> 08:12.962
- I got you. Hold on.
- (stammers)

08:12.962 --> 08:14.599
(disconnected tone plays)

08:14.599 --> 08:15.935
Damn. Phone number don't work.

08:15.935 --> 08:17.070
What is your plan,
to, like, reach out

08:17.070 --> 08:18.807
to all your old friends and ask

08:18.807 --> 08:20.711
if they're aware of what
happened in the last two hours

08:20.711 --> 08:22.548
in the city of Atlanta? How is
that, like, a reasonable plan?

08:22.548 --> 08:24.118
Bro, you got to calm down, man.

08:24.118 --> 08:26.255
You don't know how none
of this shit work at all, bro.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.092
I guess I don't understand
how any of this works

08:28.092 --> 08:30.296
if you have to, like, wear
a $200,000 piece of equipment

08:30.296 --> 08:33.169
- to look cooler.
- Bro, you always
oversimplifying shit.

08:33.169 --> 08:34.973
It's not just
about looking cool, Dave.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.843
Okay, what about having
your friend wear

08:36.843 --> 08:38.647
a security T-shirt
when he's not a security guard

08:38.647 --> 08:40.150
around you in public
just to look cooler?

08:40.150 --> 08:41.586
Is that an oversimplification?

08:41.586 --> 08:43.122
Niggas need the chain, for sure.

08:43.122 --> 08:45.226
Did you say "for show"
or "fo' sho'"?

08:45.226 --> 08:46.697
Fo' sho'.

08:46.697 --> 08:48.232
(phone chimes)

08:48.232 --> 08:50.738
DAVE:
Oh, my God.
Rick Ross just DM'd me.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.174
What?

08:52.174 --> 08:53.577
DAVE:
A link.

08:53.577 --> 08:54.979
Yeah, we got a nigga chain, man.

08:54.979 --> 08:56.917
We got that motherfucker, nigga.

08:56.917 --> 08:58.721
- Hell yeah.
- Hell yeah, bring the bag, homeboy.

08:58.721 --> 09:00.123
Oh, no.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.893
- What? Tell me.
- Look at it, look at this.

09:01.893 --> 09:03.997
Oh, no.

09:03.997 --> 09:06.268
Them niggas got the chain, dawg.

09:06.268 --> 09:07.872
Yeah, no shit
they got the chain.

09:07.872 --> 09:09.041
- They're boasting about it.
- (phone ringing)

09:09.041 --> 09:10.745
Hey, Ross calling you right now.

09:10.745 --> 09:12.013
What? Pick up for me.

09:12.013 --> 09:13.082
Why would I pick up?

09:13.082 --> 09:14.619
My hands are pretty fucking...

09:14.619 --> 09:15.688
Dude, that ain't got shit
to do with me.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.859
Pick up, bro. Pick up.

09:19.696 --> 09:21.031
Hey, Rick.

09:21.031 --> 09:23.871
I see my goddamn chain
with my name on it

09:23.871 --> 09:26.810
all across the Internet
with some bullshit.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.279
I tried so hard
to find you in the club,

09:28.279 --> 09:30.083
and I-I couldn't.
Like, you weren't there.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.218
I don't know where you went.

09:31.218 --> 09:33.022
Hey, hey,
save all that punk shit.

09:33.022 --> 09:35.326
You may think
you could punk somebody...

09:35.326 --> 09:37.030
No, I don't like to punk people.

09:37.030 --> 09:38.634
I'm totally unaffiliated
with the show Punk'd.

09:38.634 --> 09:39.969
I know that you went on it.

09:39.969 --> 09:41.071
And I saw--
I watched the Quibi thing.

09:41.071 --> 09:42.374
I know that moved to Roku.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.777
- I know all about that.
- Fuck Roku.

09:43.777 --> 09:45.246
I don't think that people

09:45.246 --> 09:47.050
are gonna know that
it's your chain necessarily.

09:47.050 --> 09:48.921
It's just an "R."
Couldn't it be, like,

09:48.921 --> 09:49.923
Robert De Niro's chain?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.827
They tagging me!

09:51.827 --> 09:54.298
Stop licking
your motherfucking fingers.

09:54.298 --> 09:56.068
Get your thumb out your ass.

09:56.068 --> 09:58.841
And you better get it back now.

09:58.841 --> 10:01.212
I'll make sure
you ain't good nowhere.

10:01.212 --> 10:02.915
And that's on God.

10:02.915 --> 10:04.819
We kill about mine.

10:04.819 --> 10:06.690
They die about mine.

10:06.690 --> 10:07.892
No... (stammers) So...

10:08.961 --> 10:10.798
Fuck.

10:10.798 --> 10:12.200
- Let me see that, bro.
- If he starts talking

10:12.200 --> 10:13.670
about me online, too,
like, honestly,

10:13.670 --> 10:15.140
I'm gonna be fully blackballed.

10:15.140 --> 10:16.810
Hey, I got it, come on. I know--
Hey, we got to go.

10:16.810 --> 10:18.212
I know where to go.
I see the nigga fur.

10:18.212 --> 10:20.718
Who the fuck is Fur?

10:21.520 --> 10:24.659
Yo. Almost d
idn't recognize you
with them dreads.

10:24.659 --> 10:26.730
- I know, huh.
- When the last time I seen you?

10:26.730 --> 10:28.199
Shit, Lil Marco memorial.

10:28.199 --> 10:30.370
(groans) Yup.

10:30.370 --> 10:32.240
You know you could've just
called a nigga

10:32.240 --> 10:33.844
instead of bum-rushing me
in the middle of the night

10:33.844 --> 10:34.979
like you the police.

10:34.979 --> 10:36.282
GATA:
Man, you know I done had

10:36.282 --> 10:37.685
ten numbers
since I lived out here.

10:37.685 --> 10:38.954
What you doing in town anyway?

10:38.954 --> 10:40.356
Shit, I'm just on tour
right now.

10:40.356 --> 10:41.893
- That's right.
- Yup.

10:41.893 --> 10:43.129
Your sister told me
you was doing good

10:43.129 --> 10:44.231
- with the music.
- Mm-hmm.

10:44.231 --> 10:45.835
She come to your show tonight?

10:45.835 --> 10:47.103
I don't be talking to her
like that.

10:47.103 --> 10:48.372
ART:
Oh, I feel you.

10:48.372 --> 10:49.909
Doesn't your sister
live in L. A.?

10:49.909 --> 10:51.245
That's my cousin.

10:51.245 --> 10:53.382
Your sister is your cousin?

10:53.382 --> 10:54.786
Yeah.

10:54.786 --> 10:56.723
What?

10:58.727 --> 11:00.698
What the fuck is that?

11:00.698 --> 11:02.033
- (Art laughs)
- GATA: Damn.

11:02.033 --> 11:04.137
- That's crazy.
- That right there, cuh,

11:04.137 --> 11:05.406
unbelievable.

11:05.406 --> 11:07.010
Finna make a killing.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.780
We got about 15 of them
off the truck.

11:08.780 --> 11:11.151
- Wow, so cool.
- GATA: Hey, unc.

11:11.151 --> 11:13.289
You see this jacket right here?

11:13.289 --> 11:14.759
You sell that to anybody?

11:14.759 --> 11:16.997
And do you recognize
these voices?

11:16.997 --> 11:19.401
(Duggy and Bingo speaking
indistinctly on video)

11:19.401 --> 11:22.274
- What if I do?
- I need that info, man.

11:22.274 --> 11:23.877
These niggas snatched
a chain from us.

11:23.877 --> 11:25.013
They trying to flip it
and get some money.

11:25.013 --> 11:26.482
But it's not just any chain.

11:26.482 --> 11:28.152
They snatched Rick Ross chain.

11:28.152 --> 11:30.189
I can't go out like that.
That's bad for him,

11:30.189 --> 11:32.160
and it's bad for me. All you got
to do is give me a phone number.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.864
I'll do the rest.

11:33.864 --> 11:35.734
Don't worry about nothing.
Just give me the number.

11:35.734 --> 11:37.905
Nephew, you ain't supposed to be
tangled up in all this, nigga.

11:37.905 --> 11:38.907
Come on, unc.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.176
Please.

11:42.949 --> 11:44.251
Sit.

11:45.220 --> 11:46.288
Oh.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.925
(line ringing)

11:47.925 --> 11:49.328
(whispers):
Come on.

11:49.328 --> 11:50.330
DUGGY (over phone):
Hello.

11:50.330 --> 11:52.167
Hey, what's up?

11:52.167 --> 11:53.904
It's the dude you stole
the chain from.

11:53.904 --> 11:55.473
How the hell y'all get
my number anyway?

11:55.473 --> 11:57.043
Man, don't worry about all that.

11:57.043 --> 11:58.513
I seen your corny-ass post
on Instagram.

11:58.513 --> 12:00.517
How much the fuck y'all want
to get it back?

12:00.517 --> 12:02.855
- We need 50 bands.
- Lower the aggro level.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.057
Bro, we ain't
no bitches, though.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.494
- Hello?
- I am a bitch.

12:05.494 --> 12:06.830
- Bro, we got...
- Start operating under, like,

12:06.830 --> 12:08.032
that we're half-bitch.

12:08.032 --> 12:09.167
- Hello?
- Would you pay 50 for it?

12:09.167 --> 12:10.504
Are you fucking kidding?

12:10.504 --> 12:13.042
Would I pay $50,000
of my own money? No.

12:13.042 --> 12:14.779
Bro, $50,000 is like
five dollars to you.

12:14.779 --> 12:16.081
$50,000 is $50,000.
What are you talk-- what?

12:16.081 --> 12:17.484
You have no idea
what my finances are.

12:17.484 --> 12:19.388
They're not as good
as you think they are,

12:19.388 --> 12:20.991
- if you're talking this way. No.
- Hey, man, you on the phone

12:20.991 --> 12:22.460
right now,
you got fucking five minutes...

12:22.460 --> 12:24.264
Hey, man, y'all know
who chain that is, man.

12:24.264 --> 12:26.001
He ain't trying to make this
issue bigger than it already is.

12:26.001 --> 12:29.007
And Ross ain't coming
out of pocket for this shit.

12:29.007 --> 12:30.811
And he ain't trying
to go to war either.

12:30.811 --> 12:32.515
Hey.

12:32.515 --> 12:34.986
If you get us a Rick Ross
feature, bro, we all good.

12:34.986 --> 12:37.223
I'm-a tell you now, my--
I'm a man of my word, man.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.862
- (mouthing)
- If Rick Ross give us a verse,
we'll be good, bro.

12:39.862 --> 12:41.533
They just need a Rick Ross
feature? You already have one.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.069
Just give 'em the thing
on your hard drive from Benny.

12:43.069 --> 12:45.841
Hell nah. That's my Ross verse.

12:45.841 --> 12:47.945
You know how hard it was
to get that from Benny?

12:47.945 --> 12:50.083
It wasn't hard at all.
It was a fucking WeTransfer.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.853
Do you have $50,000
you want to spend, Gata?

12:51.853 --> 12:53.523
- (sighs)
- Hello?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.527
All right, fine.

12:56.295 --> 12:59.368
- You're still on mute.
- Oh, fuck.

12:59.368 --> 13:00.504
All right, fine.

13:00.504 --> 13:02.173
We gonna get you the verse

13:02.173 --> 13:04.177
and we gonna get the chain back,
straight like that.

13:04.177 --> 13:06.415
I'm-a text you the address.
Come in the morning.

13:06.415 --> 13:08.520
- No funny business.
- And thank you so much
for working with us.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.524
- Really appreciate it. What...
- Relax, bro. Goddamn.

13:14.231 --> 13:16.235
- MIKE: What? What is it?
Hurry up!
- Not up, but

13:16.235 --> 13:17.838
Down-- down, down!

13:17.838 --> 13:19.408
- Yeah, not in, but...
- Around!

13:19.408 --> 13:20.844
- Go downtown.
- What? No.

13:20.844 --> 13:21.946
- Uh, down and out!
- (Mike shouts)

13:21.946 --> 13:23.149
Yes!

13:23.149 --> 13:24.886
- (laughs)
- ELZ: Okay, go, go, go.

13:24.886 --> 13:26.288
- Okay, uh,
it's a corporate entity.
- EMMA: Yeah.

13:26.288 --> 13:27.958
They've been stealing our data

13:27.958 --> 13:29.929

13:31.265 --> 13:33.235
Facebook, but it's a-a movie.

13:33.235 --> 13:34.839
- Oh, The Social Network!
- Social Network!

13:34.839 --> 13:36.108

13:36.108 --> 13:37.344
It goes on your toes.

13:37.344 --> 13:39.014
Oh, like a lube! Come!

13:39.014 --> 13:40.517
- No, it goes on your feet.
- Come? Nail polish!

13:40.517 --> 13:42.120
- No, uh... Ugh!
- Oh, my God!

13:42.120 --> 13:43.590
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.326
- It was foot fungus.
- Oh, my God. Holy shit.

13:45.326 --> 13:46.496
- Foot fungus.
- EMMA: Fuck, dude.

13:46.496 --> 13:49.401
God, these are dry-clean only.

13:49.401 --> 13:50.470
Party foul.
You got to pay for the pants.

13:50.470 --> 13:52.073
Yo, I'm sorry.

13:52.073 --> 13:53.342
I'll just wash the pants.
I'll wash the pants.

13:53.342 --> 13:54.579
He can't fucking pay
for the pants.

13:54.579 --> 13:56.115
He owes me fucking,
like, 600 bucks.

13:56.115 --> 13:57.852
MIKE:
You owe her money?

13:57.852 --> 13:59.454
- You owe me $500.
- EMMA: You fucker.

13:59.454 --> 14:01.191
- Okay, okay, okay.
- MIKE: You owe everybody money.

14:01.191 --> 14:03.396
I get it, I get it. Ha, ha, ha.

14:03.396 --> 14:04.599
Jesus, just leave it.

14:04.599 --> 14:06.168
- What's wrong?
- I know.

14:06.168 --> 14:07.470
- Calm down.
- We're just kidding around.

14:07.470 --> 14:09.374
Dude, I'm just...

14:09.374 --> 14:11.613
I'm broke.

14:11.613 --> 14:14.217
What do you mean, like,
you're a broken soul?

14:14.217 --> 14:16.623
No, no, man, like, I'm broke.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.459
Dude, I haven't gotten paid
for a publishing on

14:18.459 --> 14:20.329
any of these songs that I made
'cause they never came out.

14:20.329 --> 14:22.333
You know,
I hate to ask for money.

14:22.333 --> 14:23.637
That's why I hated
asking you two.

14:23.637 --> 14:25.373
I was tired of asking
my parents.

14:25.373 --> 14:27.077
I know they're tired
of me asking, and it's like...

14:27.077 --> 14:29.114
Dude, I haven't gotten a haircut
in three weeks, bro.

14:29.114 --> 14:31.051
- Your hair looks fine.
- I feel crazy.
That's what you tell me

14:31.051 --> 14:32.353
- because you have
to tell me that.
- EMMA: Yeah, it looks fine.

14:32.353 --> 14:33.990
You're being nice. It's okay.

14:33.990 --> 14:35.326
Yeah, listen, when you're Black,

14:35.326 --> 14:37.297
you need a lineup
every fucking week.

14:37.297 --> 14:39.602
You're not my only Black friend,
for-- news flash, buddy.

14:39.602 --> 14:41.105
I've had lots of Black friends,

14:41.105 --> 14:42.575
and-and they all have hair

14:42.575 --> 14:44.211
that looks a lot like yours.

14:44.211 --> 14:46.115
- (both laugh)
- But it's not a big deal.

14:46.115 --> 14:47.350
We're gonna be all white.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.421
- All right. Ah...
- (both laugh)

14:49.421 --> 14:51.659
- That is the worst thing
to tell...
- I am gonna be all white.

14:51.659 --> 14:53.295
You're all Black,
and I'm all white!

14:53.295 --> 14:55.066
- (shouting, whooping)
- You're all Black,

14:55.066 --> 14:56.636
- and I'm all white!
- You're gonna knock this over!

14:56.636 --> 14:58.406
BOTH (chanting):
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

15:02.715 --> 15:04.284

15:09.327 --> 15:10.463
- Yo.
- MAN: What's up, man. You Mike?

15:10.463 --> 15:12.133
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

15:12.133 --> 15:14.004
- So I'm cutting you?
- Uh, no, no, no.

15:14.004 --> 15:16.609
Him. Elz.

15:16.609 --> 15:19.381
Yo. I got you a barber, man.

15:19.381 --> 15:21.619
Gonna get you all lined up
before the brunch later today.

15:21.619 --> 15:23.623
Surprise.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.961
Oh, nigga,
I thought that was Gata.

15:25.961 --> 15:27.631
He does not look
like Gata to me.

15:27.631 --> 15:29.669
- You have to say that.
You have to say that.
- Okay.

15:29.669 --> 15:31.305
- But I love you.
- Okay.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.375
- Thank you. Yeah.
- We do this a lot. It's okay.

15:36.415 --> 15:38.119
- They said go around back?
- Yeah.

15:38.119 --> 15:40.089
I mean, this is such
a stressful situation, man.

15:40.089 --> 15:42.060
- Like, between Rick Ross
or them, I...
- Damn it, man. Shit.

15:42.060 --> 15:43.997
Stretch ain't even gonna be able
to make it, man. He just told me

15:43.997 --> 15:45.501
- he can't get off work in time.
- Stretch was supposed to come?

15:45.501 --> 15:47.370
You said we didn't even need
to come with people.

15:47.370 --> 15:48.640
I know you ain't used
to this type of shit, bro,

15:48.640 --> 15:50.209
but you need
some adversity, bro.

15:50.209 --> 15:52.247
You fall down seven times,
you get up eight.

15:52.247 --> 15:53.482
What the fuck
are you talking...?

15:53.482 --> 15:55.019
Enough with these phrases
and -isms.

15:55.019 --> 15:56.421
Why would I have to get up
eight times

15:56.421 --> 15:57.992
if I've only fallen down seven?

15:57.992 --> 15:59.495
The math doesn't even add up.

15:59.495 --> 16:00.998
Because we started
on the ground.

16:00.998 --> 16:02.467
We got it out the mud, bro.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.237

in Atlanta long as y'all want.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's cool, yeah.

20:07.958 --> 20:09.294
- Wow.
- Yo, the floors are marble.

20:09.294 --> 20:11.532
- Damn...
- Goddamn.

20:11.532 --> 20:13.670
DAVE:
Mr. Ross.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.974
GATA:
You think Rozay cut the grass
with his luxury John Deere?

20:15.974 --> 20:18.680
DAVE:
I think someone who works
for him might have a John Deere.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.982
GATA:
Rozay, where you at?

20:19.982 --> 20:21.853
(sneezes, groans)

20:21.853 --> 20:24.290
Hey, when is this guy arriving?

20:24.290 --> 20:25.827
I have, like,
a nuclear bomb in my pocket.

20:25.827 --> 20:28.298
- I got to get this chain out.
- Bro, you got to relax.

20:28.298 --> 20:29.467
He gonna be here
when he be here.

20:29.467 --> 20:30.737
You know he's not
gonna be on time.

20:30.737 --> 20:32.674
Oh!

20:32.674 --> 20:34.845
- Those guys that robbed us
followed me on Instagram.
- What?

20:34.845 --> 20:36.816
- Yeah.
- I told you the streets
gonna fuck with you, bro.

20:36.816 --> 20:39.688
One mutual friend...

20:39.688 --> 20:41.826
- Stretch.
- What?

20:41.826 --> 20:43.997
Let me see that.

20:43.997 --> 20:48.338
I guess Atlanta
is a small world.

20:48.338 --> 20:51.445
- But...
- (mutters) This shit is crazy.

20:51.445 --> 20:53.449
Hey. I got to go
check on something, dawg.

20:53.449 --> 20:54.919
I'm about to go handle
something real quick.

20:54.919 --> 20:56.589
Wait, you think that...?

20:58.526 --> 21:00.396
MAN (in distance):
Killer Mike!

21:05.473 --> 21:07.978
(exhales)
Fuck.

Hey, man.

21:35.867 --> 21:38.438
You were the first person
I ever saw live in concert.

21:41.979 --> 21:44.919
And I actually give women
lap dances because of you.

21:44.919 --> 21:46.488
So thank you for...

21:46.488 --> 21:48.626
Man, what you say, bitch?

21:48.626 --> 21:50.931
I said that you're, like,
my biggest inspiration.

21:50.931 --> 21:52.801
My live show is modeled
after yours.

21:54.705 --> 21:56.408
Yeah, my bad. All right, yo.

21:56.408 --> 21:58.078
I thought you was on
some disrespectful shit, bro.

21:58.078 --> 21:59.949
- I ain't even know.
Appreciate that, man.
- No.

21:59.949 --> 22:01.986
- How are you, man? Yeah.
- I'm good.

22:01.986 --> 22:03.455
Well, actually, I'm not good.

22:03.455 --> 22:06.529
I'm in a little bit
of an online beef

22:06.529 --> 22:07.931
with Killer Mike.

22:07.931 --> 22:10.670
- Ah.
- I've never met the man.

22:10.670 --> 22:13.075
He's here. How do I handle this?

22:13.075 --> 22:14.778
Well, I mean, you...

22:14.778 --> 22:16.381
Probably guess you'll have
to beat his ass, man.

22:16.381 --> 22:17.951
Oh.

22:17.951 --> 22:19.788
Between me and you,
I don't think there's, like,

22:19.788 --> 22:22.059
a Black person 14 years or up

22:22.059 --> 22:24.063
that I'd feel comfortable fighting.

22:24.063 --> 22:26.702
- Yeah.
- Like, debate?
What about a debate?

22:26.702 --> 22:28.740
No, bro, he really,
really smart.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.944
- He's that smart? You know him
and that he's that smart?
- Yeah.

22:30.944 --> 22:32.413
I'm telling you, man, listen.

22:32.413 --> 22:34.083
- This game will eat you up, bro.
- Yeah.

22:34.083 --> 22:36.488
You know how many people said
I was like a dancey-dancey,

22:36.488 --> 22:38.927
chicken noodle soup-eating-ass
motherfucker?

22:38.927 --> 22:40.530
- Chicken-- chicken noodle...
- You know what I'm saying?
But you ain't never hear them

22:40.530 --> 22:42.935
say that shit twice,
I promise you.

22:42.935 --> 22:44.939
- (whispers): Promise you.
- Yeah.

22:44.939 --> 22:46.909
Have-have you fought?

22:48.746 --> 22:50.850
Have you fought men?

22:50.850 --> 22:52.688
- (stammers)
- Good talking to you, man.

22:52.688 --> 22:54.658
- Okay, thank you.
So nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

22:56.729 --> 22:57.898
So they gonna--
they gonna spin around?

22:57.898 --> 22:59.033
All right,
I ain't gonna look at it.

22:59.033 --> 23:00.102
It's gonna make me dizzy, goddamn.

23:00.102 --> 23:01.572
I'm-a shoot it. Boo, boo, boo.

23:01.572 --> 23:04.043
Hey! Come up here, my boy.

23:04.043 --> 23:05.981
Come on, man.
Let's do this thing, dawg.

23:05.981 --> 23:07.718
- Oh, you know
I got to get one with you.
- You feel me?

23:07.718 --> 23:09.989
Out the mud with it.
Looking like new money, huh?

23:09.989 --> 23:11.993
- Can't believe I called you
the big homie.
- (whooping)

23:11.993 --> 23:13.930
- Hey, man...
- You know I know
what you did, right?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.103
What you mean?

23:17.103 --> 23:19.173
I know you set us up.

23:19.173 --> 23:21.512
I see right through you, nigga.

23:21.512 --> 23:23.917
How much they pay you?

23:23.917 --> 23:26.121
Hey. Yo, G, I'm...

23:26.121 --> 23:27.925
I needed the bread.

23:27.925 --> 23:29.628
I didn't want to have
to ask you for no money

23:29.628 --> 23:31.866
and be that guy, man, I...

23:31.866 --> 23:35.540
(scoffs)
Some things just must be done.

23:35.540 --> 23:39.013
Look, I appreciate you for
understanding, fam, for real.

23:39.013 --> 23:40.750
Nah, like us.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.688
We done.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.090
What you mean?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.459
G, come on, man.

23:45.459 --> 23:47.163
What you mean...

23:47.163 --> 23:50.770
DAVE:
I'll also have
two 1800 Cristalinos, please.

23:50.770 --> 23:53.475
Thank you.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.878
(exhales)

24:00.055 --> 24:02.193
How did that go?

24:02.193 --> 24:05.199
You're so damn lucky
you're you, dawg.

24:05.199 --> 24:07.838
People ain't asking you
for shit.

24:07.838 --> 24:09.207
You ain't got no extra weight
on your shoulders,

24:09.207 --> 24:10.944
no baggage, dawg.

24:10.944 --> 24:13.650
Like, it's like crabs
in a bucket where I'm from, bro.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.019
This shit is crazy.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.557
You have an eyelash.
Can I get it?

24:17.557 --> 24:18.593
(Gata exhales)

24:19.928 --> 24:21.932
- Okay, now make a wish.
- (scoffs)

24:21.932 --> 24:23.636
Sorry.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.172
I wish I wasn't at this party
right now, bro.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.513
I can't even understand
how he would do that to you.

24:28.513 --> 24:31.752
It's something you would
never understand, bro.

24:34.692 --> 24:37.229
DAVE:
Well, makes you feel any better,

24:37.229 --> 24:39.601
Rick Ross is here.

24:39.601 --> 24:41.806
- Let's go talk to him.
- Talk to him?

24:41.806 --> 24:43.976
He just want to get
the chain back.

24:43.976 --> 24:45.580
I'm-I'm not even
in the right headspace

24:45.580 --> 24:46.916
to be going over there.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.559
You've done this for me
a million times,

24:51.559 --> 24:52.561
I'm gonna do it
to you right now.

24:52.561 --> 24:53.796
You're the fucking man.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.700
You hear me?
You are the fucking one.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.103
I know you're going
through some shit right now.

24:57.103 --> 24:59.207
I can't even fathom
how that feels, but...

24:59.207 --> 25:00.944
he's right there.
Your dream is right there.

25:00.944 --> 25:03.683
You've waited, what, ten
fucking years for this moment?

25:03.683 --> 25:05.587
Are you really gonna
let this ruin your life?

25:05.587 --> 25:06.756
- Nah, bro. You right.
- Right?

25:06.756 --> 25:07.991
What did you say earlier?
You said,

25:07.991 --> 25:09.293
"Fall seven times,
get up eight"?

25:09.293 --> 25:10.864
- Get up eight.
- Get up eight, right?

25:10.864 --> 25:12.701
This will be the eighth time
or whatever.

25:12.701 --> 25:14.571
This is the fucking moment where
you got to go do this shit.

25:14.571 --> 25:16.107
- Let's do it.
- All right?
We have a whole chain

25:16.107 --> 25:17.109
to give him, we have
a conversation, we have an in.

25:17.109 --> 25:18.579
Go give him this.

25:18.579 --> 25:19.848
- Snap out of it.
- (exhales) Let's go.

25:19.848 --> 25:21.585
- Let's go.
- Let's go fucking do it.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.827
Hey, Rozay?

25:25.827 --> 25:28.800
Got something for you, champ.

25:31.939 --> 25:33.910
Ooh.

25:33.910 --> 25:36.749
Yeah. Good looking out
for this, homie.

25:36.749 --> 25:39.988
And hopefully I didn't get y'all
tied up in no shit, did I?

25:39.988 --> 25:41.759
Nah, that shit was a breeze.

25:41.759 --> 25:43.730
Depends how you look at life.

25:43.730 --> 25:46.134
But you know who really came
through is this guy Gata.

25:46.134 --> 25:47.637
- (mouths)
- I would never have--
Well, I'm just saying,

25:47.637 --> 25:49.307
we would never--
I was just a passenger,

25:49.307 --> 25:50.744
and no-- he totally got the
whole situation taken care of.

25:50.744 --> 25:52.614
If you don't know Gata,

25:52.614 --> 25:54.050
I would never be me
if it wasn't for him.

25:54.050 --> 25:55.352
You guys got to know him--
he's a great rapper,

25:55.352 --> 25:57.123
great artist, all of that.

25:58.358 --> 25:59.895
Hey, you remember that one time

25:59.895 --> 26:01.732
you was in the "A,"
you was low on bud?

26:01.732 --> 26:03.603
I had to re-up for you, man.
I went out there

26:03.603 --> 26:04.872
and got it out the mud,
you know what I'm saying?

26:04.872 --> 26:05.940
Had that 14 grams for the low.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.778
Wasn't a lot, but...

26:07.778 --> 26:09.147
Yo, I came through with that
lemon pepper pizza, though.

26:09.147 --> 26:11.284
- You ain't never had that.
- I remember that.

26:11.284 --> 26:14.023
- Yeah, bro.
- You saved the weekend
with that shit.

26:14.023 --> 26:15.660
Oh, good looking, bro.

26:15.660 --> 26:17.329
- Look at you now, though.
- Had to stop by Icebox

26:17.329 --> 26:19.100
to get a little, you know what
I'm saying, somethin'-somethin'.

26:19.100 --> 26:22.039
Red nigga got big minks.
I see you with the ice on.

26:22.039 --> 26:23.776
Like you say, "for no reason."

26:23.776 --> 26:25.179
ROSS:
Shit, I'm-a be here
for a couple days.

26:25.179 --> 26:27.249
Come by the studio. Pull up.

26:27.249 --> 26:28.986
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's make some magic.

26:28.986 --> 26:30.657
GATA:
Oh, fo' sho'.
We gonna make some magic.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.093
- Matter of fact...
- You with it?

26:32.093 --> 26:33.328
Yeah-- hell yeah, I'm with it.
Matter of fact,

26:33.328 --> 26:35.332
I got this record
that you already on.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.069
I just need you
to clear it for me.

26:39.741 --> 26:41.679
Um...

26:42.681 --> 26:44.183
Killer Mike.

26:44.183 --> 26:48.358
You tweeted about me,
and I have spent all day stewing

26:48.358 --> 26:50.062
about how I was gonna
respond to this.

26:50.062 --> 26:51.799
But I realized today
that if I take one-tenth

26:51.799 --> 26:54.203
of the energy that I've spent
trying to prove to you

26:54.203 --> 26:56.207
that I'm not bad
for the Black community

26:56.207 --> 26:58.946
towards actually doing good
for the Black community,

26:58.946 --> 27:01.084
I would be such
a better human being.

27:01.084 --> 27:02.854
- So...
- Who are you?

27:02.854 --> 27:05.159
- Who am I?
- Yeah. Who-who are you?

27:05.159 --> 27:07.697
You just gave me a diatribe
about me tweeting you.

27:07.697 --> 27:09.668
I don't know who you are.
Who are you?

27:09.668 --> 27:12.006
Lil Dicky, the rapper.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.743
- I'm on tour...
- Oh.

27:13.743 --> 27:15.279
The tweet where I said
I don't know about this guy.

27:15.279 --> 27:16.982
I didn't-- No, I don't--

27:16.982 --> 27:18.753
No, not that I didn't
know about you.

27:18.753 --> 27:20.088
The homie was just
turning me on to you.

27:20.088 --> 27:22.092
Like, you're-- You rap, right?

27:22.092 --> 27:23.896
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I just didn't know
who you were.

27:23.896 --> 27:25.299
Oh.

27:25.299 --> 27:27.269
- Yeah.
- Oh.

27:27.269 --> 27:29.908
But it does sound like you got
a lot of internal conflict

27:29.908 --> 27:32.112
and a lot of questioning
your own character

27:32.112 --> 27:34.918
in terms of social justice
and what you can do to help...

27:34.918 --> 27:37.256
- Yeah. I am.
- ...my community,
and if-if that's the case,

27:37.256 --> 27:38.960
don't live in the abstract.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.964
Don't live in the social justice
world of Twitter or IG.

27:40.964 --> 27:44.303
- Yeah.
- Like, how would you feel
about donating 15,000 bucks

27:44.303 --> 27:45.840
to a Black bank?

27:45.840 --> 27:48.245
Uh, yeah.

27:48.245 --> 27:49.982
I'd feel really good about that.

27:49.982 --> 27:51.886
Uh, $50,000 is...

27:51.886 --> 27:54.323
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I said 15,

27:54.323 --> 27:56.194
but if you're willing to do 50,
that's showing people

27:56.194 --> 27:57.998
"I put my money
where my mouth is."

27:57.998 --> 27:59.768
- Yeah, I misheard.
- I'm-a tell...

27:59.768 --> 28:01.004
But I-I think...

28:01.004 --> 28:02.807
50 is what I want to do.

28:02.807 --> 28:05.412
Yeah, 'cause 50, like--
Th-This chain is over 50 grand.

28:05.412 --> 28:06.882
Chains are really expensive, huh?

28:06.882 --> 28:08.184
Well, chains mean
something sacred.

28:08.184 --> 28:10.422
- You know, in my community.
- Right.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.959
But I fuck with you for fucking
with Black people.

28:11.959 --> 28:13.261
- Thank you.
- The 50-band man.

28:13.261 --> 28:14.932
- 50-band man.
