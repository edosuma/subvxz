The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.500 --> 00:04.542
Oh, there we go.

00:04.708 --> 00:06.250
GARY:
Wow. The heck is that?

00:06.375 --> 00:08.625
It was very common
during the middle 1700s.

00:08.750 --> 00:12.000
<i>CORJAN:
In 1746,
King Louis XV sent two ships</i>

00:12.167 --> 00:14.875
<i>to Oak Island where they
later created the Money Pit.</i>

<i>RICK:
If we can find original works</i>

00:17.542 --> 00:20.333
at the base of this shaft,
it may solve the mystery.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.833
Oh, what's that?
Whoa, whoa. What's that?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.333
STEVE:
That's a view down the tunnel.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.833
Is it possible that
this tunnel could lead

00:24.958 --> 00:26.292
to finding the treasure?

00:26.417 --> 00:28.625
The answer
is unequivocally "yes."

00:31.333 --> 00:34.750
<i>NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic</i>

00:34.875 --> 00:37.000

<i>an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.</i>

00:41.167 --> 00:44.042
<i>So far, they have found
a stone slab</i>

00:44.167 --> 00:46.625
<i>with strange symbols
carved into it,</i>

00:46.750 --> 00:50.875
<i>man-made workings

00:51.042 --> 00:53.500
<i>and a lead cross whose origin</i>

<i>may be connected
to the Knights Templar.</i>

00:56.375 --> 01:01.833
<i>To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.</i>

01:02.000 --> 01:04.500
<i>And, according to legend,</i>

01:04.667 --> 01:10.292
<i>one more will have to die before
the treasure can be found.</i>

-RICK: Morning, sir.
-Morning, Rick. How's it going?

01:31.583 --> 01:34.000
-How are you?
-How was your weekend?

01:34.125 --> 01:36.208
I see your weekend was
quite constructive.

01:36.375 --> 01:38.625
-Oh, yeah.
-It looks a lot different
than it did.

01:38.708 --> 01:40.208
PAUL:
Yeah, it did, eh?

01:40.375 --> 01:42.417

-Sure.

<i>the reconstruction of
the so-called "Garden Shaft."</i>

02:12.333 --> 02:15.500
The fill was, uh, backfilling
in back into the shaft,

02:15.583 --> 02:18.333
so we had to put some planks
in this corner right here.

02:18.458 --> 02:21.375
This corner was, uh,
those two-by-sixes missing,

02:21.500 --> 02:23.667
so we added
some of those in there.

02:23.833 --> 02:25.583
-So far so good.
-Yeah.

and we do have
some chemistry back from this.

02:48.333 --> 02:50.708

02:53.833 --> 02:56.458
<i>connected to
the original Money Pit.</i>

02:56.583 --> 03:00.667
We found, uh, gold in,
uh, the Garden Shaft.

03:00.792 --> 03:02.375
(laughter)

03:03.542 --> 03:05.708
So, today's work, what-what's
that going to entail?

03:05.833 --> 03:07.583
So, today, we're gonna
finish closing up

03:07.708 --> 03:09.333
the, uh, shaft structure.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.833
And then, uh, we're gonna
seal it up with some plastic.

03:11.917 --> 03:14.917
Is this gonna be the deck?

03:15.042 --> 03:16.208
That's your top elevation,
right here.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.792
-Okay.
-There's gonna be 16 inches

03:18.917 --> 03:20.292
of concrete for
five feet around.

03:20.417 --> 03:23.000
Like that should
hold everything together

03:23.167 --> 03:24.792

nice and tight.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.208
It's the first time

04:12.375 --> 04:15.500
the fellowship has
physically ventured underground.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.750
<i>So, you know,
Rick's "eyes and boots."</i>

04:17.875 --> 04:20.000

<i>we've tried previously.
I think what we're gonna find</i>

04:22.500 --> 04:25.292
at the bottom
will be a surprise.

04:25.417 --> 04:28.583
Not only does it let us
get down underground

04:28.708 --> 04:31.417
in the Money Pit for the very
first time after ten years...

04:31.542 --> 04:33.333
-Yep.
-...but this shaft might be

04:33.417 --> 04:36.000
very, very important
for furthering

04:36.125 --> 04:39.000
our understanding of where
the original Money Pit might be.

04:39.125 --> 04:42.292
You're underground where
for 227 years

04:42.417 --> 04:44.750
people were searching for
answers for the mystery.

04:44.875 --> 04:46.833
-Yeah.
-And now, finally,
we're gonna be underground

04:46.958 --> 04:48.958
doing the same thing.

04:49.042 --> 04:51.167
So, I'm taking up time.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.667
I'm gonna let you
get to your business.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.417
-All righty, thank you, Paul.
-Yep, thank you.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.000

-That's one of
the positive things.
-Okay.

05:57.042 --> 05:59.667

-MARTY: Yes.
-...somewhere else on the lot.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.042
Okay, there's a good point.

<i>of a wooden tunnel
some 103 feet deep</i>

09:57.750 --> 09:59.792
<i>that they believe</i>

09:59.875 --> 10:02.833
<i>could be related to

10:02.958 --> 10:06.333
Okay, we've got a bottom
that is in situ and natural.

10:06.458 --> 10:08.375
And then we've got
a confirmation

10:08.500 --> 10:09.958
of a tunnel
is what that's telling me.

10:10.042 --> 10:11.875
SCOTT:
We have wood
all the way down here.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.833
-Quite a bit of it here.
-TERRY: Yeah.

10:13.958 --> 10:16.875
Mike, how deep were you when,
uh, you stopped to pull out

10:17.000 --> 10:18.458
and then it dropped out on you?

10:18.542 --> 10:19.833
107.

10:19.958 --> 10:22.333
And it felt open below that,

10:22.458 --> 10:24.708
but where exactly
I picked that up?

10:24.833 --> 10:28.333
Somewhere between 103 and 105.

10:28.417 --> 10:30.833
-SCOTT: Well, good job
for hitting it.
-TERRY: Absolutely.

10:30.917 --> 10:33.417
And we're only, what,
five or seven feet away

10:33.542 --> 10:35.125
from our other hits?

10:35.208 --> 10:39.375
Do we want to leave casing here
and run a sonar?

10:39.500 --> 10:41.583
If we do get a good sonar image,
we can try

10:41.708 --> 10:42.792
to get a, uh, camera down there.

10:42.875 --> 10:43.875
Then try the camera, yeah.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.167
Yeah, no, I agree. Let's do it.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.083
<i>MARTY:
So, lo and behold,
J-15.25 does hit wood</i>

10:51.208 --> 10:52.833
but more to the point,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.833
a void below the wood,
an open tunnel most likely.

10:55.917 --> 11:00.167
<i>So, we're gonna run sonar in
there and see what it can see.</i>

11:00.292 --> 11:03.083
<i>We have to discover
more about it so we can say,</i>

11:03.208 --> 11:04.500
<i>is it a searcher tunnel?</i>

11:04.583 --> 11:06.042
<i>Is it a depositor's tunnel?</i>

11:06.167 --> 11:07.708
<i>If it's within our power
to find out,</i>

11:07.833 --> 11:09.042
<i>we need to do so.</i>

11:10.000 --> 11:12.750
Okay, like, I think
we got a plan.

11:12.875 --> 11:16.583

already did for possible C-14.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.833

Okay, first flag's
over here, mate.

12:04.417 --> 12:07.542
When a lot is cleared,
I usually go in first,

12:07.708 --> 12:09.292
and I flag the area.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.542
Meaning I do a methodical grid,

-Ooh.
-That's a piece of something.

12:41.958 --> 12:45.250
That could be interesting.

12:45.375 --> 12:49.375
It's got a curve on it, so it
could be, like, a barrel hoop.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.917
JACK:
You think it's connected
to the wharf somehow?

12:53.042 --> 12:55.208

13:15.917 --> 13:19.458
I would imagine
that's just the type of thing

13:19.542 --> 13:22.542
that would've been unloaded
and put ashore. A barrel.

13:22.708 --> 13:25.750

Based on this, we can't see
the western wall.

It's probably blocked
by something.

15:39.708 --> 15:43.000
But I'd say that's the tunnel
projection. Do you guys agree?

I mean, it is
very tunnel-looking.

So, we have an image now.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.833
It looks like a tunnel here,
potentially.

15:55.958 --> 15:59.125
It's a very defined
linear object.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.708
And this looks like
the outline of a tunnel.

16:01.875 --> 16:04.042
Yeah, I'd say
that's apparent, yeah.

16:04.167 --> 16:07.042

20:11.208 --> 20:12.333
<i>-Hi, everyone.</i>
-MARTY: Corjan, hello.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.667
Charlotte, nice to meet you.

20:14.792 --> 20:16.292
Nice to meet you, too.

20:16.417 --> 20:20.000
You are all well aware
of the serious attempt

20:20.125 --> 20:23.042
we've made in this past year
to create a research team.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.000
And, uh, today we have
special guests

20:26.125 --> 20:27.500
Corjan Mol
and Charlotte Wheatley.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.667
<i>They are the France team.</i>

20:29.792 --> 20:33.167
<i>NARRATOR: In light of recent
discoveries made on the island,</i>

20:33.292 --> 20:35.333
<i>which may date
to the mid 18th century,</i>

20:35.458 --> 20:37.667
<i>including the Garden Shaft,</i>

20:37.833 --> 20:41.500
<i>and the potential
ship's wharf on Lot 32...</i>

20:41.583 --> 20:44.250
-Those are orders
from d'Anville, right?
-Yeah.

20:44.375 --> 20:46.000
<i>NARRATOR:
...as well as documentation</i>

20:46.125 --> 20:48.125
<i>uncovered in
the British archives</i>

20:48.250 --> 20:50.500
<i>by Marty and Alex Lagina,</i>

20:50.667 --> 20:52.792
<i>Oak Island researchers
Corjan Mol</i>

20:52.875 --> 20:55.667
<i>and his colleague
Charlotte Wheatley</i>

20:55.750 --> 20:58.792
<i>are presenting new information
on how these clues</i>

20:58.875 --> 21:01.500
<i>may connect to
the Oak Island mystery.</i>

21:02.542 --> 21:06.167
Today they are here,
remotely, to make a presentation

21:06.292 --> 21:07.833
about the Duc d'Anville
expedition

21:07.917 --> 21:10.167
and possible associations

21:10.292 --> 21:12.000
to what happened here
long, long ago.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.167
So, what have
you two come up with?

21:14.333 --> 21:17.458
<i>For this presentation,
the question is this one.</i>

21:17.583 --> 21:20.417
Could we find
any relation between

21:20.542 --> 21:22.667
Oak Island,
and perhaps Mahone Bay,

21:22.833 --> 21:27.167
<i>and the 1746 expedition
of a French armada</i>

21:27.292 --> 21:29.667
led by Monsieur
de La Rochefoucauld,

21:29.833 --> 21:31.708
better known as
the Duc d'Anville?

21:32.875 --> 21:36.333
<i>So, let me share some background
information with you all.</i>

21:36.500 --> 21:40.917
<i>So, in June 1745,</i>

21:41.042 --> 21:44.167
<i>Fortress Louisbourg in Canada,
which was, you know,</i>

21:44.250 --> 21:49.167
<i>the largest military structure
outside France in North America,</i>

21:49.292 --> 21:52.333
<i>unexpectedly
went into English hands.</i>

21:52.417 --> 21:56.500
The French weren't very good
losers, and in response,

21:56.625 --> 21:58.875
they formed the largest armada
to sail

21:59.000 --> 22:02.500
<i>from France to
the Atlantic coast of Canada</i>

22:02.625 --> 22:06.083
and it was led
by the Duke of Anville.

22:08.708 --> 22:12.500
<i>NARRATOR:
When King Louis XV
dispatched the French armada</i>

22:12.625 --> 22:16.583
<i>with orders to reclaim
Nova Scotia in 1746,</i>

22:16.708 --> 22:19.667
<i>the admiral in charge,
known as the Duc d'Anville,</i>

22:19.792 --> 22:22.292
<i>was a member
of the Rochefoucaulds,</i>

22:22.417 --> 22:24.167
<i>a family of nobles</i>

22:24.250 --> 22:25.792
<i>who had ties to
the Knights Templar</i>

22:25.917 --> 22:29.333
<i>dating back to
the 11th-century Crusades.</i>

22:30.375 --> 22:31.958
<i>Unfortunately,
the armada's efforts</i>

22:32.083 --> 22:35.833
<i>to reclaim control
of Nova Scotia failed.</i>

22:35.958 --> 22:39.667
I found eight pages
of what looks like a ship's log.

22:39.833 --> 22:43.958
<i>NARRATOR:
However, in 2017, Doug Crowell</i>

22:44.083 --> 22:47.000
<i>found a partial ship's log
in the provincial archives</i>

22:47.125 --> 22:50.333
<i>stating that d'Anville
had carried out a second mission</i>

22:50.417 --> 22:54.000
<i>somewhere south of Halifax
that succeeded.</i>

22:54.125 --> 22:56.500
<i>DOUG:
"September 8th,
it has been agreed that</i>

22:56.625 --> 22:59.208
<i>"a deep pit be dug
and treasure securely buried.</i>

22:59.375 --> 23:00.958
<i>"The pit to have
a secret entrance</i>

23:01.083 --> 23:02.292
<i>by a tunnel from the shore."</i>

23:02.375 --> 23:05.250
I mean, a great quantity
of treasure, and...

23:05.375 --> 23:08.125
and they-they appear
to be in this bay.

23:10.208 --> 23:14.750
Before the armada sailed
from France

23:14.875 --> 23:18.083
to the other side of the ocean,
they sent two ships ahead,

23:18.208 --> 23:21.708
<i>-and that's where
we start our story.</i>
-Okay.

23:21.833 --> 23:25.917
<i>So, here is the documentation
from the French archives.</i>

23:27.208 --> 23:33.250
<i>King Louis sent two ships,
the</i> Aurore <i>and</i> le Castor.

23:33.375 --> 23:37.958
<i>These were officially classified
as King's Ships, which meant</i>

23:38.042 --> 23:42.542
that they had personal orders
from King Louis XV of France.

23:43.875 --> 23:46.917
<i>The documentation mentions here
that the king, having given</i>

23:47.042 --> 23:50.083
<i>a particular destination
to</i> l'Aurore <i>and</i> le Castor,

23:50.208 --> 23:55.542
demanding that they depart
in the first days of March 1746.

23:56.542 --> 23:59.833
<i>And you can see it
in the text on the left,</i>

23:59.917 --> 24:04.125
<i>he really says
"a certain location,"</i>

24:04.250 --> 24:08.208
which isn't made known anywhere
else in the documentation.

24:09.667 --> 24:12.792
But Louis XV, he says something
about this destination.

24:12.917 --> 24:15.333
Uh, "The destination
that will be given to them

24:15.417 --> 24:17.833
requires an increase
in the standard crew."

24:17.917 --> 24:21.667
<i>This means that the</i> Aurore
<i>will have 250 men</i>

24:21.750 --> 24:25.250
<i>and the</i> Castor <i>will have 180.</i>

24:25.375 --> 24:30.333
The <i>Aurore</i> and the <i>Castor</i>
arrived on the Acadian Coast

24:30.458 --> 24:34.042
on June 4, 1746 near Mahone Bay.

24:37.167 --> 24:42.333
So, Corjan, the French sent two
rather large ships full of men.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.417
What officially
did they accomplish?

24:44.542 --> 24:46.167
According to
the records, nothing.

24:46.292 --> 24:48.583
(laughing):
That doesn't make sense.

24:48.708 --> 24:51.250
This is where I-I take off
my researcher hat

24:51.375 --> 24:54.375
and put on my, uh, theorist hat.

24:54.542 --> 24:56.375
<i>And, uh, it's possible that they</i>

24:56.542 --> 24:58.542
<i>were sent to check on Oak Island</i>

24:58.667 --> 25:00.833
and to check a location

25:00.958 --> 25:03.000
where they later created
the Money Pit.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.292
<i>MARTY:
Well, that is
quite extraordinary.</i>

25:12.208 --> 25:13.375
RICK:
Well, it's certainly
thought-provoking.

25:13.542 --> 25:14.958
I will say that.

25:15.042 --> 25:17.500
<i>NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island war room,</i>

25:17.625 --> 25:19.167
<i>researchers Corjan Mol
and Charlotte Wheatley</i>

25:19.292 --> 25:21.208
<i>have just presented new evidence</i>

25:21.333 --> 25:24.542
<i>that French naval vessels
may have visited Mahone Bay</i>

25:24.708 --> 25:28.458
<i>and possibly Oak Island in 1746,</i>

25:28.583 --> 25:30.708
<i>just months before
the Duc d'Anville</i>

25:30.833 --> 25:35.750
<i>reportedly led a mission to bury
a vast treasure in the area.</i>

25:35.875 --> 25:38.667
<i>But the story continues.
We have documents from</i>

25:38.833 --> 25:41.500
<i>one man who's called Duvigneau.</i>

25:41.625 --> 25:43.792
<i>So, Commander Duvigneau
commanded</i>

25:43.875 --> 25:45.667
both the <i>Aurore</i> and the <i>Castor.</i>

25:45.750 --> 25:48.042
So, these would be
the ship's logs, correct?

25:48.167 --> 25:50.792
-Exactly.
-It's like a sort of
partial diary.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.708
<i>There is a part
where the captain</i>

25:52.875 --> 25:55.042
<i>of the</i> Aurore,
<i>uh, is in this bay</i>

25:55.208 --> 25:57.417
and he doesn't want
anybody else to tell

25:57.542 --> 25:59.167
anybody else that he's there.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.500
<i>That's what was written.</i>

26:01.667 --> 26:03.833
So, that, again,
is-is strange behavior.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.333
Hmm.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.083
Now, if you continue
to read the logs,

26:08.208 --> 26:11.250
Duvigneau starts to
leave holes in his logs,

26:11.375 --> 26:15.042
so the-the holes in his records
become bigger and bigger,

26:15.167 --> 26:17.500
<i>and then after
another gap in the journal,</i>

26:17.625 --> 26:20.500
the <i>Aurore</i> and the <i>Castor</i>
sail home to France.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.042
They were there for two months.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.500
Hmm.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.333
So, that's a long time
to do nothing.

26:26.417 --> 26:28.500
Yeah.

26:28.625 --> 26:30.417
What they did
is a very good question.

26:30.542 --> 26:33.208
There are so many holes
in the journal,

26:33.375 --> 26:34.333
it's hard to actually say.

26:34.500 --> 26:35.792
<i>MARTY:
Yeah.</i>

26:35.875 --> 26:37.250
What did they say
when they went back?

26:37.375 --> 26:38.667
What did they do?

26:38.792 --> 26:40.750
<i>CORJAN:
On return to France,</i>

26:40.875 --> 26:44.667
<i>these captains would submit
their journals to the admiralty,</i>

26:44.750 --> 26:46.583
to be stored in the records.

26:46.708 --> 26:50.458
You know, the French were, and
are, meticulous record keepers,

26:50.583 --> 26:53.417
<i>so they demanded from
the captains their records.</i>

26:53.542 --> 26:57.958
<i>And Duvigneau
went with a bigger crew,</i>

26:58.042 --> 27:00.292
where he is past Mahone Bay.

27:00.417 --> 27:04.167
He puts a letter with
the submission of his records

27:04.250 --> 27:05.708
in which he says,

27:05.833 --> 27:08.458
<i>"I will not speak to
anyone about this place,</i>

27:08.542 --> 27:11.750
<i>but I'm obliged to send
my journal of navigation."</i>

27:12.667 --> 27:14.917
<i>This is quite intriguing,
I must admit.</i>

27:18.292 --> 27:20.667
<i>RICK:
All of that
is incredibly interesting.</i>

27:20.792 --> 27:22.375
The Duc d'Anville story,

27:22.500 --> 27:24.625
<i>the expedition to recapture</i>

27:24.708 --> 27:28.792
<i>Louisbourg and the secret
mission from the king,</i>

27:28.875 --> 27:32.417
<i>and the fact that two ships
were sent on ahead</i>

27:32.542 --> 27:34.333
<i>for a secret deployment.</i>

27:35.333 --> 27:37.833
<i>We've got ships
that are outfitted</i>

27:37.917 --> 27:40.208
<i>with more men than are needed
to sail the ship.</i>

27:40.333 --> 27:44.125
Typical of Oak Island, it begs
more questions than answers.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.833
But the questions
are quite interesting.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.000
The only thing you do know
is that he was--

27:50.125 --> 27:54.708
he had orders from the king
to conduct a-a secret mission.

27:54.833 --> 27:56.667
A special military operation.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.917
And-and yet he reports
none of it.

27:59.042 --> 28:01.667
<i>He-he reports neither
success nor failure.</i>

28:01.750 --> 28:03.875
Just, "I am not
going to speak of,"

28:04.000 --> 28:05.875
quote, unquote, "this place."

28:06.042 --> 28:06.708
Yes.

28:06.875 --> 28:10.042
So, he did do something.

28:10.167 --> 28:12.292
Exactly. That's the conclusion.

28:12.375 --> 28:15.250
And one of the reasons this is
so interesting right now

28:15.375 --> 28:17.667
is because some of the
carbon dates and even the dendro

28:17.833 --> 28:19.708
that we've been getting
on the island here,

28:19.833 --> 28:22.000
some of the dates in
the Money Pit area have been

28:22.083 --> 28:25.500
coming up all in
that mid-1700s time range.

28:25.625 --> 28:28.542
So, this seems to be
in-in that era,

28:28.708 --> 28:31.083
so it makes it
extra interesting.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.875
<i>NARRATOR:
Could the mysterious
ship's logs written by crewmen</i>

28:35.000 --> 28:37.833
<i>who served under the French
admiral Duc d'Anville</i>

28:37.958 --> 28:40.417
<i>really be referencing
an operation</i>

28:40.542 --> 28:42.542
<i>on Oak Island that was conducted</i>

28:42.667 --> 28:47.375
<i>in order to prepare for
the burial of treasure in 1746?</i>

28:47.542 --> 28:50.625
<i>Might that explain
the evidence of a wharf,</i>

28:50.708 --> 28:52.667
<i>as well as the metal artifacts,</i>

28:52.792 --> 28:54.708
<i>and the French cargo bag seal</i>

28:54.833 --> 28:57.500
<i>that the team
has found on Lot 32?</i>

28:57.583 --> 29:02.417
<i>And might they also be related
to the mid-18th-century tunnels</i>

29:02.542 --> 29:05.083
<i>and the Garden Shaft
in the Money Pit,</i>

29:05.208 --> 29:09.083
<i>where they've also detected
high traces of silver and gold?</i>

29:10.542 --> 29:13.542
<i>MARTY:
The trip I took to England
fits in with Corjan Mol's theory</i>

29:13.708 --> 29:15.375
<i>about the Duc d'Anville.</i>

29:15.500 --> 29:17.167
<i>And so, is it possible that</i>

29:17.333 --> 29:19.500
that explains the deposit
of treasure on Oak Island?

29:19.625 --> 29:21.167
Yes, it's possible.

29:21.333 --> 29:24.208
-I enjoyed
the presentation a lot.
-Absolutely.

Wow.

32:25.042 --> 32:27.250
180 gallons of whiskey?

32:29.417 --> 32:31.042
-I guess.
-(laughter)

32:31.167 --> 32:35.417
Would your average person
have a-a barrel this big?

32:36.500 --> 32:39.292
So, what-what type of use...?

32:39.375 --> 32:41.292
Like, would this be
a naval thing?

32:43.167 --> 32:46.292
Why would you have such
a large barrel over on Lot 32?

32:50.333 --> 32:53.292
JACK:
Wow. Any dates that
you can discern out of this?

33:01.375 --> 33:03.458
Well, that's actually
really intriguing.

33:04.708 --> 33:07.458
<i>NARRATOR:
A second piece of
a large cargo barrel?</i>

33:08.542 --> 33:10.833
<i>And found in the same area
where the team</i>

33:10.917 --> 33:13.875
<i>has discovered evidence of
a possible ship's wharf,</i>

33:14.000 --> 33:19.375
<i>as well as a lead bag seal
believed to be of French origin?</i>

33:19.500 --> 33:22.667
<i>If so, has the team
uncovered more evidence</i>

33:22.750 --> 33:25.542
<i>possibly connecting
the Duc d'Anville's mission</i>

33:25.667 --> 33:30.542
<i>to bury a vast treasure in 1746
to the Oak Island mystery?</i>

33:30.708 --> 33:35.083
<i>RICK:
We know that there was a lot
of military-associated items</i>

33:35.208 --> 33:37.333
<i>found on the island.</i>

33:37.458 --> 33:39.875
<i>When Carmen suggested
that this barrel</i>

33:40.000 --> 33:41.958
could have been as old as 1740,

33:42.042 --> 33:45.250
well, 1740 is an "aha" date

33:45.375 --> 33:47.625
because that, of course, is, uh,

33:47.750 --> 33:50.375
right around the time
of the Duc d'Anville expedition.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.583
<i>Is it a possibility
that it could be connected</i>

33:53.708 --> 33:56.958
<i>to some work on the island
associated with that expedition?</i>

33:57.083 --> 33:58.500
<i>It's possible.</i>

33:58.625 --> 34:01.375
But we've a ways to go
to prove that.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.000
That's incredibly enlightening.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.292
You breathe life
into these artifacts

34:05.375 --> 34:06.875
that, to us, are
somewhat lifeless.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.083
And now it's come alive.

34:09.208 --> 34:11.125
Well, as always,
we appreciate it.

34:11.958 --> 34:13.917
CRAIG:
Thank you very much.

34:14.042 --> 34:15.083

-Yes. We're all set to go.

<i>but potentially
the fabled treasure, as well.</i>

34:52.125 --> 34:53.708
We'll have a marker so you can

34:53.833 --> 34:56.000
send it down
a couple inches at a time.

34:56.083 --> 34:58.125
We'll be able to get
a good clear image.

34:58.208 --> 34:59.958
All right,
let's put it down hole.

35:01.542 --> 35:03.792
<i>NARRATOR:

All right, send her down.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.167
Down the hole.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.958
<i>NARRATOR:

<i>is also equipped with a number
of visual enhancement functions.</i>

35:24.708 --> 35:28.083
So, Paul, I'm going to stop
at 103 feet,

35:28.208 --> 35:29.417
and from there we're
gonna pay close attention

35:29.542 --> 35:30.792
to see where the edge
of the casing is.

35:30.917 --> 35:32.458
Absolutely, yeah.

35:37.042 --> 35:38.375
SCOTT:
We're in the water.

35:44.375 --> 35:46.542
PAUL: Okay, slow it down
just a little bit there.

35:46.667 --> 35:48.458
SCOTT:
We should be at 103. So, you're
still seeing the casing?

35:48.542 --> 35:50.708
PAUL:
Okay, still-still seeing casing.
Now we're just coming out.

35:50.875 --> 35:53.458
We're just coming out.
We're right on the side.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.000
You're-- There's a casing?

35:55.083 --> 35:56.500
Yep, we're-we're out
of the casing.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.375
RICK:
It's really clear.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.250
STEVE:
That's a good view.

36:00.375 --> 36:02.917
PAUL:
Let me just see if
I can get around here.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.792
Rotating.

36:05.875 --> 36:07.875
<i>RICK:
This is exciting
and so interesting</i>

36:08.000 --> 36:11.250
<i>having finally found a feature
underground that we can track.</i>

36:11.375 --> 36:13.208
You don't have to infer
where it goes.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.667
You can actually visualize it.

36:15.708 --> 36:17.667
If you didn't know
you were in a tunnel,

36:17.792 --> 36:19.625
you'd think you were
on the sea floor.

36:19.708 --> 36:21.667
-Yep.
-Yep.

36:23.542 --> 36:25.500
-RICK: Oh, no.
-STEVE: Yeah, still collapsing.

36:25.625 --> 36:27.958
PAUL:
Some material just dropped
straight off, yeah.

36:29.042 --> 36:31.292
Put your view downwards
a little bit and try.

36:35.375 --> 36:36.958
-SCOTT: Whoa.
-STEVE: Whoa, what's that?

36:37.042 --> 36:38.708
-Whoa, whoa, what's that?
-Right there, right there.

36:40.333 --> 36:41.875
SCOTT:
That's broken wood right there.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.375
RICK:
Wow.

36:48.583 --> 36:49.333
- Where?
PAUL:
Right in front of you
on the left.

36:49.458 --> 36:50.417
You can see the splinters.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.625
STEVE:
Yeah, okay, I see it now.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.292
<i>NARRATOR:
It is an exciting moment
in the Money Pit area...</i>

36:54.375 --> 36:56.542
Let's rotate around
really carefully here.

36:56.708 --> 36:59.125
<i>NARRATOR: ...as Rick Lagina
and members of the team</i>

36:59.208 --> 37:02.167

<i>some 103 feet underground</i>

37:04.875 --> 37:07.333
<i>that may be heading
toward the Garden Shaft</i>

37:07.458 --> 37:10.167
<i>and, potentially,
the legendary treasure vault.</i>

37:10.333 --> 37:12.167
There's a timber right here.

37:12.250 --> 37:15.500
PAUL:
Yeah, exactly, you can see
the splinters right there.

37:15.583 --> 37:17.167
RICK:
That whole thing
could be a beam.

37:17.333 --> 37:18.792
PAUL:
Looks like it.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.833
All right, so we'll rotate
the camera around,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.875
rotate the camera up and down,
try to get a better view.

37:25.958 --> 37:27.417
So, let's go around.

37:29.917 --> 37:31.042
RICK:
Really clear.

37:31.167 --> 37:33.167
SCOTT:
Yep. It appears that we have

37:33.333 --> 37:35.417
-basically a jumble of lumber
here from the collapse.
-RICK: Yep.

37:35.542 --> 37:38.125
SCOTT:
You can see a lot
of sediment behind it.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.958
You got wood splinters
coming down there.

37:40.042 --> 37:42.833
This beam here.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.417
This may be the post that was
holding this up right here.

37:45.542 --> 37:46.833
-SCOTT: Yes.
-RICK: Yeah.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.667
SCOTT:
Just lift it up
a little bit right there.

37:48.792 --> 37:51.042
PAUL:
Let's rotate through.

37:52.417 --> 37:53.833
STEVE:
Right there.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.167
PAUL:
What is that right there?
That's interesting.

37:56.333 --> 37:58.500
STEVE:
I think you can see-- look--
you can see down that.

37:58.625 --> 38:00.292
PAUL:
Looks like there's an opening.

38:00.375 --> 38:01.708
STEVE:
I would say so.

38:01.875 --> 38:03.208
This is our opening
looking down the tunnel.

38:03.375 --> 38:04.833
SCOTT:
Yep.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.542
STEVE:
Can you look up
a little bit, Paul?

38:06.667 --> 38:08.875
-SCOTT: Just pan it up.
-PAUL: Pan it up? Okay.

38:09.042 --> 38:11.292
STEVE:
There's our beam.
There's our sidewall, maybe?

38:11.417 --> 38:13.458
-PAUL: Yes.
-RICK: Wow.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.917
PAUL:
Might it help if I turn on
the crosshair?

38:16.042 --> 38:17.333
There we go.

38:17.458 --> 38:18.625
STEVE:
Yeah, that made a difference.

38:18.708 --> 38:21.000
-RICK: It's quite amazing.
-PAUL: Yeah.

38:21.167 --> 38:24.167
So, here's what I see, and tell
me if you see something else.

38:24.292 --> 38:26.625
So, do you guys think that
this could be two supports

38:26.750 --> 38:29.125
holding up the tunnel
from completely collapsing?

38:29.208 --> 38:31.375
Because you can tell that we are
looking down the tunnel.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.667
-What do you think?
-I think that's what that is,
Steve. Y-You're right.

38:34.792 --> 38:37.333
RICK:
This is an incredible feature.

38:37.500 --> 38:38.833
-PAUL: Yes.
-RICK: It-it's awesome.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.333
STEVE:
Yeah, this is
good data today.

38:40.417 --> 38:42.292
RICK:
Oh, absolutely.

38:42.375 --> 38:44.167
-I mean, this is an area
we've never really explored.
-Yes.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.667
And, actually, every time we
drill a hole and hit the tunnel,

38:46.792 --> 38:49.500
-we're getting closer
to the Garden Shaft.
-Yeah.

38:49.667 --> 38:51.750
Is it possible that
this tunnel, if it were open,

38:51.875 --> 38:53.500
could lead somewhere
where there's

38:53.667 --> 38:55.667
some sort of original
depositional work?

38:55.792 --> 38:59.000
The answer to that
is unequivocally "yes."

38:59.125 --> 39:02.625
<i>The camera imagery from
this work is quite stunning.</i>

39:02.750 --> 39:04.667
<i>We are trying
to unravel a mystery.</i>

39:04.833 --> 39:08.333
Is it possible that this may
lead to an incredible discovery?

39:08.458 --> 39:09.792
Of course. That's the hope.

39:09.917 --> 39:12.667
It's always the hope
that some piece

39:12.833 --> 39:16.917
of information is gonna lead us
to the Bravo Tango moment.

39:17.042 --> 39:21.375
This is a ten in terms
of how it should inspire us

39:21.542 --> 39:23.500
as we move forward
with the Garden Shaft.

39:23.625 --> 39:26.542
We can't relinquish
the opportunities

39:26.708 --> 39:28.958
that that Garden Shaft
might present to us, right?

39:29.083 --> 39:31.500
So, to me,
when I see these pictures,

39:31.625 --> 39:34.375
it inspires me to move forward.

39:34.500 --> 39:35.833
I love seeing this.

39:35.917 --> 39:37.500
Yes, yep.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.000
This is very important,
and I think we should

39:39.125 --> 39:41.042
do everything we can
to-to exploit it

39:41.208 --> 39:42.833
and-and get as much,

39:42.958 --> 39:45.667
glean as much information
from this as we can.

39:45.833 --> 39:48.500
And, you know, we're
going to drill another hole

39:48.583 --> 39:50.208
that will hopefully
find the why.

39:50.375 --> 39:52.667
<i>MARTY:
With all we know on this island,</i>

39:52.833 --> 39:54.458
<i>any constructions
we're unaware of</i>

39:54.542 --> 39:56.458
<i>in the Money Pit area
is exciting.</i>

39:56.542 --> 40:00.667
<i>It appears like there's a tunnel
or something that was a tunnel</i>

40:00.833 --> 40:02.667
<i>that goes towards
the Garden Shaft.</i>

40:02.792 --> 40:04.958
That shaft could be the key

40:05.083 --> 40:06.833
to understanding
what happened here.

40:06.917 --> 40:10.167
Now it's incumbent upon us
to do what we can do

40:10.292 --> 40:12.500
to find the treasure,
to resolve the mystery.

40:12.667 --> 40:15.125
So, what it tells me
is we can't quit.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.833
-No, not today.
-Long as you're moving forward.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.208
-Long as you're moving
<i>sempre avanti.</i>
-Yes.

40:21.375 --> 40:24.500

finish our work and move on.
